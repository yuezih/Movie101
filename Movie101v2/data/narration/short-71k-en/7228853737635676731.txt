0:0:43|0:0:47|On the bustling street, only Yue Zixin and Zhang Shaobin were seen leisurely walking with a donkey.
0:0:47|0:0:51|Suddenly, the donkey, under the control of no one, broke free from the reins and charged forward.
0:0:55|0:1:0|He hopped and skipped in a comical manner, closely following behind the donkey's backside.
0:1:0|0:1:2|This scene attracted the attention of passersby on the street.
0:1:13|0:1:18|Finally, the donkey also got tired and slowed down. The man quickly stretched out his arms to block the donkey's path.
0:1:18|0:1:29|He finally grabbed the reins on the donkey's neck and subdued the giant donkey.
0:1:29|0:1:35|He hadn't even turned his head to finish speaking when the giant donkey started up again, wiggling its butt and bouncing away.
0:1:41|0:1:47|The tall buildings and wide roads intertwine at the entrance of Qinhuangdao Station, with pedestrians coming and going.
0:1:47|0:1:58|The chubby uncle who came to pick up someone was still fast asleep in the car, with his head resting on the steering wheel. Obviously, the ringing had no effect on him at all, and occasionally there were intermittent snoring sounds.
0:1:58|0:2:8|The woman here is making a phone call while urging the girls on. Following closely behind them is a group of veterans, led by [Shao Bing].
0:2:36|0:2:44|On the other side, the girls following behind the woman looked around excitedly, but the woman still couldn't get through on the phone. She awkwardly smiled at the girl next to her. 
0:2:48|0:2:52|[Zhang Shaobin] is full of spirit, feeling the warmth of returning to his hometown.
0:3:17|0:3:22|The owner of this donkey turns out to be [Zhang Shaobin].
0:3:22|0:3:26|[Zhang Shaobin] turned around and came face to face with a donkey, and they both looked at each other in confusion.
0:5:19|0:5:23|After Uncle Er left, [Zhang Shaobin] looked at the donkey, his face filled with surprise.
0:5:23|0:5:25|At this moment, [Yue Zixin] patted the car door.
0:5:38|0:5:47|The young girls followed the woman and got on the van, looking around curiously. The scenery of the big city made them yearn for it deeply.
0:5:47|0:5:51|The place is filled with high-rise buildings, and the leading girl [Yue Zixin] asked.
0:6:12|0:6:13|Hearing what Third Sister said.
0:6:13|0:6:14|The girls' faces were filled with surprise.
0:6:25|0:6:29|The van gradually drove away, carrying the dreams of a group of young girls.
0:6:29|0:6:30|At this moment, inside the police station.
0:6:46|0:6:48|Liu Ming still looked confused.
0:6:48|0:6:51|Here, the sentry puts the backpack on the donkey.
0:6:59|0:7:12|Proceed forward, don't move, Shaobin just adjusted his posture, took a step, didn't mount the donkey, but fell into a somersault.
0:7:12|0:7:21|In this scene, the onlookers burst into laughter. Yue Zixin looked at the donkey and sighed repeatedly. Helpless, he resorted to a clever trick. He got up from the ground, opened his backpack, and started playing the guitar for the donkey.
0:7:35|0:7:39|This move actually worked, the naughty donkey obediently complied.
0:7:39|0:7:50|Zhang Shaobin mounted the donkey, straightened his military uniform, pulled the reins, and set off on the journey back home.
0:8:37|0:8:40|Zixin reluctantly accepts the current situation.
0:8:57|0:9:3|After the girls all went in, [Yue Zixin] finally dropped the disguise and revealed a cunning and sinister expression in the blink of an eye.
0:9:3|0:9:10|[Zhang Shaobin] quietly closed the door, while [Yue Zixin] took out a cigarette from her bag, exuding a confident and relaxed demeanor.
0:9:10|0:9:12|[Zhang Shaobin] stood next to [Yue Zixin] with a fawning expression.
0:9:43|0:9:46|[Zhang Shaobin] covers his ears in a distressed manner.
0:9:57|0:10:1|After [Yue Zixin] finished speaking with a smile, she patted [Zhang Shaobin]'s face.
0:10:20|0:10:23|In the police station, Yue Zixin rushed over upon receiving the report.
0:10:51|0:10:57|In the street, while others drive cars, a sentry rides a donkey, attracting onlookers to gather around and take photos.
0:10:57|0:11:3|He seemed like a triumphant general, waving to the crowd in gratitude.
0:11:3|0:11:5|The sentry just arrived at the roadside, but encountered a red light.
0:11:14|0:11:20|After saying goodbye to the children, he set off on his journey again. Passing by a square dance, [Yue Zixin] was deeply attracted.
0:11:20|0:11:24|The security guard was not happy, and he staggered over to [Yue Zixin]'s side.
0:11:24|0:11:29|At this moment, Yue Zixin and Zhang Shaobin were completely engrossed in watching, not noticing that others were approaching.
0:11:29|0:11:33|The security guard gently patted his shoulder, startling [Yue Zixin].
0:11:43|0:11:57|The old man mumbled to himself, reached out to pat the donkey's head, then turned to look at [Yue Zixin].
0:11:57|0:12:0|Faced with the old man's questioning, [Yue Zixin] was momentarily speechless.
0:12:6|0:12:9|The sign reads, "No pets allowed inside."
0:12:22|0:12:23|[Yue Zixin] hurriedly explained.
0:12:32|0:12:44|He looked flustered, watching people around him pointing and whispering.
0:12:44|0:12:48|He turned around and saw piles of donkey dung, feeling embarrassed and forced to smile.
0:13:16|0:13:31|He took the receipt, reluctantly took out the money from his pocket, before he could hand over the money, he was directly dragged away by the old man.
0:13:31|0:13:37|After tidying up his clothes, he nodded in agreement.
0:13:37|0:13:42|Shaobin patted the donkey's buttocks, and the donkey swam forward, causing the old man to be instantly hit by the donkey.
0:14:1|0:14:19|On the bustling street, cars lined up in a long queue. Yue Zixin led the donkey and continued on the road. In order not to affect the city environment, he racked his brains for solutions. Just then, he coincidentally encountered a shoe insole shop. With a plan in mind, he tied the donkey outside the shop and took a look inside before walking in on his own.
0:14:21|0:14:28|Yue Zixin carefully selected shoes in front of a row of shoe cabinets, trying on several pairs in a row that didn't quite fit. At that moment, the boss walked over.
0:14:46|0:14:54|He clenched his fist, imitating the shape of a donkey's hoof to put on his shoes, with his arms acting as the ground, walking step by step.
0:14:54|0:14:54|The boss looked surprised towards the door.
0:15:43|0:15:57|The boss took the money from the sentry impatiently and urged him to leave quickly.
0:15:57|0:16:2|Mao Lv has been waiting outside for a long time. He puts new shoes on the donkey, attracting a crowd of onlookers.
0:16:7|0:16:17|The girl beside reached out and touched the donkey, the young man saw it and wanted to imitate, but the donkey refused.
0:16:17|0:16:28|Zhang Shaobin patted his hands proudly after finishing shoeing the donkey.
0:16:28|0:16:31|Onlookers either praised or took out their phones to take pictures.
0:16:40|0:16:47|Yue Zixin is fully armed and ready to hit the road, with cotton shoes on its hooves, looking quite comical as it walks along the road.
0:16:47|0:16:52|Passersby all took out their phones to take pictures and record the scene, [Zhang Shaobin] warmly waved and greeted them.
0:16:54|0:17:6|Unexpectedly, they encountered the security guard again. [Yue Zixin] saluted while riding a donkey, pointing to the donkey's hooves and rear end. This amused the old man, who had never seen a donkey wearing shoes or diapers before.
0:17:15|0:17:19|The old man looked at the figure walking away in the distance, full of sighs.
0:17:19|0:17:22|On the way, the donkey was tired and the people were thirsty.
0:17:22|0:17:27|[Sentry] found a place to rest and take a break with the donkey, and settled down to rest.
0:17:27|0:17:35|He caught the mineral water with his hand and fed the donkey.
0:17:35|0:17:42|The sentry tightened the bottle cap in his hand, set the water aside, reached out and touched [Yue Zixin], looked at [Zhang Shaobin], and suddenly had an idea.
0:17:49|0:17:52|He held [Yue Zixin] in his arms, looked at her, and burst into laughter.
0:17:52|0:18:4|The scene shifts to Jiaoluo Dahu, where the sentry, dressed in festive attire with a big flower on his chest, is leading a donkey carrying a beautiful bride. Just as he is about to cover his head, the donkey bites his arm.
0:18:4|0:18:8|This time, [Yue Zixin] just wouldn't listen to him.
0:18:19|0:18:33|Zhang Shaobin glanced at his beautiful wife, and they both bent down at the same time, with parents watching the new couple with joy in their hearts.
0:18:33|0:18:37|Zhang Shaobin and his new wife Yue Zixin faced each other, bowed slightly, but accidentally bumped heads.
0:18:41|0:19:1|He lifted his new bride in his arms and walked into the new room surrounded by everyone, the festive character "å–œ" reflecting on the side of Yue Zixin's face. The two sat properly on the edge of the bed, Zhang Shaobin slightly turned his head, and through the bride's veil, one could see the shyness on his face. He raised his hand to lift the veil for the bride, but it was unclear whether it was shyness or for some other reason.
0:19:3|0:19:11|At this moment, an apple fell from the sky. The two instantly understood the meaning and turned their heads towards each other, with Sentry shifting his somewhat stiff body slightly.
0:19:11|0:19:16|The bride lifted her veil slightly, and their faces leaned towards each other like apples.
0:19:16|0:19:20|As their breaths drew closer, the apple was moved aside, and the two fell onto the bed.
0:19:20|0:19:26|The bride then kissed [Zhang Shaobin]'s lips, her face covered in lipstick marks, pouting in enjoyment.
0:19:26|0:19:34|In the next second, everything is just a passing cloud. As [Zhang Shaobin] sleeps with his lips puckered, the one he is kissing is not the bride, but a donkey.
0:19:34|0:19:44|At this moment, [Zhang Shaobin] was still full of enjoyment, until he opened his eyes and the huge donkey face made it hard for him to accept, immediately flipping over.
0:19:44|0:19:45|He frantically wiped his face with his sleeve.
0:20:4|0:20:15|[Zhang Shaobin] demanded a donkey as compensation, but ended up being punished by a green donkey's face. The atmosphere inside the police station was unexpectedly calm. Liu Ming, with ambitious aspirations, was unable to act on them, as he gazed at his reflection in the mirror, solemnly saluting.
0:20:15|0:20:18|After the ceremony, they performed a set of passionate military boxing.
0:20:22|0:20:29|He looked at himself in the mirror, thinking about the unit he was in now, with all his aspirations buried deep in his heart.
0:20:35|0:20:39|On the other side, the sentry's donkey once again showed its stubbornness.
0:21:22|0:21:25|Carrying the rabbit and pig killed by his father, [Yue Zixin] cried all night.
0:22:1|0:22:6|[Zhang Shaobin] was seen bowing his head, listening to the donkey's opinion.
0:22:6|0:22:9|When watching, [Yue Zixin] looked confused, but he understood what the donkey meant.
0:22:14|0:22:30|Zhang Shaobin said this and left gracefully, leaving behind Big Brother Shoulu who stayed in place.
0:22:30|0:22:35|After bidding farewell to Brother Donkey, Yue Zixin embarked on a new journey, and it was getting late.
0:22:38|0:22:40|He tied the donkey to a pillar in the park.
0:23:12|0:23:14|Zhang Shaobin looked defiant, waiting to see what else they had to say.
0:23:42|0:23:55|When Fa Ge appeared in his sight, it was as if the whole world trembled for a moment. [Zhang Shaobin] stared at the advancing figure with infatuation in his eyes, his demeanor elegant and extraordinary.
0:23:55|0:24:6|His steps were light and graceful, exuding a unique charm and elegance as he walked, inspiring awe in those around him.
0:24:6|0:24:11|[Zhang Shaobin] was still immersed in the shock before him, only to hear Brother Fa gently speak.
0:24:14|0:24:16|Brother Fa raised his hand to stop him, and the younger brother immediately shut up.
0:24:16|0:24:17|Fa Ge glanced sideways at the donkey.
0:24:33|0:24:34|Upon hearing this, [Zhang Shaobin] finally realized.
0:24:59|0:25:25|Fa Ge waved his hand, as if driving someone away. [Zhang Shaobin] was full of anger, sighed deeply, turned around, and planned to leave with a heavy heart.
0:25:25|0:25:28|Soon, [Zhang Shaobin] was once again kicked out of a hotel.
0:25:49|0:25:52|The boss waved his hand, signaling [Zhang Shaobin] to leave quickly.
0:25:52|0:25:56|Night fell, and he still hadn't found a place to stay, leading the donkey around in search.
0:25:56|0:26:3|At this moment, passing by a dilapidated room, [Zhang Shaobin] thought of staying here for the night and setting off when it was light.
0:26:3|0:26:9|The air was filled with barking dogs, the bell on the donkey jingled, and the yard was scattered with straw.
0:26:9|0:26:14|He looked around and gently tied the donkey to a fallen tree trunk nearby.
0:26:38|0:26:44|[Zhang Shaobin], after settling the donkey, walked into the old room and smoothed out the messy straw to make a simple bed.
0:26:44|0:26:46|For [Zhang Shaobin], who used to be a soldier,
0:26:46|0:26:51|These are nothing, he skillfully and quickly tidied up the bed in just a few moves.
0:26:51|0:26:55|He covered himself with the coat and drifted into a peaceful sleep.
0:26:55|0:27:4|At this moment, Zixin, who came to the big city to find a job, has made no progress yet, while the other girls who came at the same time have all found jobs, leaving her puzzled.
0:27:4|0:27:7|She thought for a moment and decided to ask [Zhang Shaobin] who was watching TV.
0:27:47|0:27:50|After a slap from the third sister, [Zhang Shaobin] clearly stopped messing around.
0:29:10|0:29:15|[Yue Zixin] knocked Zixin unconscious with a punch, and she lay motionless on the bed.
0:29:15|0:29:24|[Yue Zixin] was fast asleep on a bed made of grass, completely unaware of what was happening not far away.
0:29:24|0:29:26|At this moment, Zixin woke up.
0:29:26|0:29:27|The rest of the money has been coming in.
0:29:37|0:29:44|Listening to the movement outside the room, [Yue Zixin] dared not move, but it seemed like the cunning third sister had discovered something.
0:31:8|0:31:15|After he finished explaining, he closed the door and left. This silly kid, Yue Zixin, started being dishonest again.
0:31:15|0:31:24|Hearing Sanjie say she was going to take a bath, without even looking at the accounts, I saw Zixin still not awake, so I tiptoed out of the room.
0:31:26|0:31:33|[Yue Zixin] saw an opportunity and secretly observed the surrounding environment until she watched Zhang Shaobin walk out of the room looking foolish.
0:31:33|0:31:38|She got up from the bed brightly, moving lightly, afraid to make any noise.
0:31:38|0:31:44|Shahui was still immersed in secretly watching Sanjie take a bath, completely ignoring the matter of the account book.
0:31:44|0:31:48|[Yue Zixin] came to the front room, picked up the account book on the table, and was shocked by its contents.
0:31:50|0:31:57|At this moment, Yue Zixin, who was leaning on the windowsill, accidentally knocked over the vase.
0:31:57|0:32:1|He was scared and hurried back, only to meet [Yue Zixin] who was running away.
0:32:1|0:32:6|[Yue Zixin] kicked Shaohui in the butt, then climbed over the wall and escaped, finally reaching the rooftop by climbing a ladder.
0:32:17|0:32:21|Yue Zixin slapped Zhang Shaobin as soon as she approached, and Zhang Shaobin, in great pain, staggered to catch up.
0:32:21|0:32:26|She climbed over the wall, [Yue Zixin] looked towards the rooftop, anxiously searching for a way down.
0:32:26|0:32:32|The roof was too high, making it difficult for a little girl to jump down, which made [Yue Zixin] extremely anxious.
0:32:32|0:32:40|Watching the silly gray horse about to reach the roof, [Yue Zixin] felt extremely anxious, but finally made up her mind and sat on the edge, sliding down smoothly.
0:32:40|0:32:43|The little girl was lucky enough to land on a rock, as if blessed by the heavens.
0:32:43|0:32:49|After escaping, the houses outside were lined up in the pitch-black night, with visibility so low that you couldn't even see your own hand in front of your face.
0:32:49|0:32:56|At this moment, [Yue Zixin] and [Zhang Shaobin] also rushed out with a panicked look on their faces, chasing after [Ma Dongmei].
0:32:56|0:33:0|Zixin heard some movement and quickly hid, luckily her sisters did not notice anything unusual.
0:33:1|0:33:15|Directly searching in another direction, the late-night village is filled with gloom and desolation everywhere. Yue Zixin and Shaohui are like two demons rampaging around, [Yue Zixin] hurriedly running forward, not daring to stop for a moment.
0:33:15|0:33:25|By chance, she arrived at the old house where [Zhang Shaobin] and the donkey were staying temporarily. Afraid of being found by the third sister, she had to find a hiding place first. [Zhang Shaobin] was still dreaming inside, with a wedding scene playing out.
0:33:26|0:33:36|The two sat facing each other, he blinked hard, trying to see the bride's face clearly, but it was not to be. The more he tried to see the truth, the blurrier it became.
0:33:36|0:33:40|He rubbed his eyes and looked at the bride again.
0:33:40|0:33:52|Zhang Shaobin's face still had a lingering smile, but suddenly Yue Zixin rushed in. In the moment of urgency, she slipped on a wooden stick on the ground, which happened to hit her and pinned her down on the sleeping Zhang Shaobin.
0:33:52|0:33:55|Shaobin woke up from his sleep and thought the person on top of him was actually the bride.
0:33:56|0:34:2|The overlapping of dreams and reality made him momentarily unable to distinguish between truth and falsehood, leaving him in a daze.
0:34:6|0:34:9|Before he could finish speaking, he fainted again.
0:34:12|0:34:14|He picked up Zixin and hurried towards the hospital.
0:34:14|0:34:17|At this moment, they are still searching.
0:34:17|0:34:21|Yue Zixin noticed the bell on the donkey and hurriedly chased after it.
0:34:21|0:34:24|Luckily, [Yue Zixin] cleverly covered the girl with clothes.
0:34:24|0:34:26|As they passed by, they found nothing.
0:34:34|0:34:36|Yue Zixin listened to Zhang Shaobin saying,
0:34:36|0:34:38|It makes sense.
0:35:8|0:35:15|On the main road, [Yue Zixin] hurriedly led the girl, not daring to stop for a moment, afraid that the bad guys would catch up again.
0:35:15|0:35:22|Zixin lay drowsily on the donkey's back, reaching out to put the account book into the pouch on the donkey's body, afraid of any further mishaps.
0:35:22|0:35:23|In the van, 
0:35:28|0:35:44|Yue Zixin kept following Zhang Shaobin like a dogskin plaster with her brother-in-law in tow.
0:35:58|0:36:9|He accelerated the speed of the car, while the sentry on this side hurried along with the donkey. Although he was exhausted and panting, he dared not show the slightest negligence, as they were about to reach the destination soon.
0:36:30|0:36:35|Saving lives is the priority, she directly picked up the girl and ran inside.
0:36:35|0:36:40|Finally, [Yue Zixin] was placed on the hospital bed, and her tense expression finally eased slightly.
0:36:40|0:36:50|The doctor was diagnosing the CT scan of [Yue Zixin]'s brain when suddenly, a sentinel appeared behind him.
0:36:50|0:36:56|At this moment, following the mule, Yue Zixin and Zhang Shaobin also arrived at the entrance of the hospital.
0:37:1|0:37:6|Yue Zixin was nowhere to be seen as the two of them split up and searched around the hall.
0:37:6|0:37:9|Yue Zixin went to see her with a flustered look, confusion evident in her eyes.
0:37:9|0:37:10|They arrived at the nurse station.
0:38:32|0:38:34|Yue Zixin heard the doctor say this.
0:38:34|0:38:36|The two looked at each other and began acting.
0:39:4|0:39:7|After the doctor left, Yue Zixin couldn't hold it anymore and started laughing hysterically.
0:39:11|0:39:16|Yue Zixin's tone also became gentle, lightly patting Shan Hui's head, and they walked out of the hospital lobby together.
0:39:16|0:39:26|On their way out, Yue Zixin and Zhang Shaobin saw the donkey in front of them acting suspiciously. They carefully observed around the donkey, but before they could see clearly, the security guard ran out.
0:39:39|0:39:54|Shahuai reached out to wipe the donkey's wet diaper, only to find that his hand was covered in donkey urine.
0:39:54|0:40:1|The smell on his hands speaks for itself, in a fit of anger, he lifts his foot to kick the donkey.
0:40:25|0:40:34|Not long after, the sentry was attracted by the donkey's braying, and he walked over to the donkey, carefully examining it from top to bottom, afraid that the donkey might be injured or uncomfortable in any way.
0:40:47|0:40:50|Zhang Shaobin stuffs the clothes into the donkey's pouch.
0:40:57|0:40:59|He hurried to the hospital.
0:41:0|0:41:7|After the sentry left, [Yue Zixin] and Shaohui showed up, finally knowing what the person who took Zixin looks like.
0:41:7|0:41:15|[Yue Zixin] made a gesture, and Shaohui followed suit, leaving with a warning to the security guard, whose face was probably twisted in confusion.
0:41:16|0:41:21|At the hospital entrance, police officer Liu Ming was getting off work and happened to ride by on his bike.
0:41:21|0:41:27|Tied to the door, the donkey immediately caught his interest, and he walked towards the donkey after parking his bicycle.
0:41:27|0:41:34|Recently, more and more villagers have been losing their donkeys. In the middle of the night, when they come across unattended donkeys, they reach out and start inspecting them.
0:41:34|0:41:39|The security guard appeared behind him, but he was so focused that he didn't notice at all.
0:41:49|0:41:51|[Liu Ming] was puzzled now.
0:42:19|0:42:20|Upon hearing the security guard say this.
0:42:20|0:42:24|[Liu Ming] noticed something unusual and was drawn to the inexplicable scent emanating from him.
0:42:29|0:42:37|[Liu Ming] also went to the hospital to inquire about the situation. The security guard, faced with the situation all night, sat on the steps, still unable to figure it out in the end.
0:42:37|0:42:51|In the hospital, Zhang Shaobin was followed by Yue Zixin. When he entered the ward, Yue Zixin and Shahuiguiguisui appeared sneakily in the corridor, both looking extremely tense. Yue Zixin kept looking back from time to time, afraid of being discovered.
0:42:51|0:42:55|At the door of the ward, two people leaned against the door, looking inside through the glass.
0:43:41|0:43:46|Before Third Sister could finish speaking, someone came over, scaring the two of them into silence and leaving quickly.
0:43:46|0:43:59|As soon as the doctor pushed open the door and entered, the two of them sneaked back in a furtive manner. They pressed against the wall and quickly arrived at the door of the ward. They positioned themselves and looked inside. At that moment, they happened to encounter [Liu Ming] who came in to check the situation.
0:44:0|0:44:7|Seeing this situation, [Yue Zixin] immediately became alert, hiding at the end of the corridor, ready to investigate the situation inside at any time.
0:44:7|0:44:13|[Zhang Shaobin] was still engrossed in looking around the ward, completely unaware that someone was approaching them.
0:44:13|0:44:19|The male doctor came over and patted [Zhang Shaobin] on the shoulder, but was hit in a vital spot by her fist.
0:44:59|0:45:12|[Zhang Shaobin] leaned in close to the doctor and whispered.
0:45:12|0:45:15|The doctor nodded and pushed [Zhang Shaobin] aside, then walked into the ward.
0:45:15|0:45:21|Shaohui was overjoyed when he heard that the girl had lost her memory.
0:45:21|0:45:25|Shahu lowered his head and hurriedly walked forward, but was pulled back by [Zhang Shaobin].
0:45:27|0:45:30|This scene was all seen by Zhang Shaobin in the dark.
0:45:30|0:45:34|As a police officer, he clearly sensed that there was another conspiracy behind this incident.
0:45:34|0:45:39|He looked through the glass at the ward and finally decided to follow up and take a look.
0:45:39|0:45:44|In the hospital room, two doctors are looking at a CT scan of the brain.
0:45:57|0:46:4|Shortly after, [Zhang Shaobin] finished giving instructions and then left.
0:46:4|0:46:7|Shaobin thought he was talking about someone else, looking around nervously.
0:46:7|0:46:12|This scene made [Yue Zixin] dizzy.
0:46:38|0:46:41|The doctor didn't say anything more, just turned around and left.
0:46:41|0:46:45|In the hospital room, only the two of them were left, and [Yue Zixin] hurriedly said.
0:46:45|0:46:48|He grabbed the arm of the sentry.
0:46:59|0:47:7|Shaobin looked at the hand held by the blanket, then raised his head and carefully examined it for a long time, as if he suddenly figured it out.
0:47:23|0:47:28|Yue Zixin fiddled with the ring on her hand, completely unaware that she was being followed by Zhang Shaobin.
0:47:41|0:47:46|After she finished speaking, she left with a silly expression, and behind her, Liu Ming walked out from around the corner.
0:47:46|0:47:51|As a police officer, [Yue Zixin] couldn't turn a blind eye to this matter and secretly decided to investigate it thoroughly.
0:47:51|0:47:54|[Yue Zixin] walked to the gate of the courtyard and saw the security guard sleeping.
0:48:1|0:48:8|Faced with the strong-willed [Yue Zixin], the security guard had no choice but to agree, and then the two of them drove off in a van.
0:48:8|0:48:18|After they left, Liu Ming came to the entrance of the courtyard, looked in the direction of the van for a while, then turned to look at the donkey.
0:48:18|0:48:21|At this moment, the phone rang, and he quickly took out his mobile phone to check.
0:48:35|0:48:44|He thought for a long time but still couldn't figure it out. A donkey actually caused so much trouble. He sat in front of the donkey, staring straight at it.
0:48:44|0:48:52|In the police station, Liu Ming was called back by the chief. The chief was holding a photo of a missing donkey, while Liu Ming stood aside lost in thought.
0:48:52|0:48:55|The man in camouflage clothing doesn't look like a donkey thief.
0:49:12|0:49:19|The sun rose as usual, accompanied by the joyful chirping of birds, and Yue Zixin was also discharged from the hospital.
0:49:37|0:49:42|The doctor watched the two figures leaving, shook his head slightly, and turned back to work.
0:49:42|0:49:47|He happened to run into [Zhang Shaobin] coming out of the hospital. Watching the two of them gradually move away, he decided to follow.
0:49:55|0:49:57|Zixin playfully hides on the other side of the donkey.
0:50:14|0:50:17|The security guard, Yue Zixin, couldn't control his anger and fiercely slapped the donkey's buttocks.
0:50:17|0:50:22|After seeing the donkey off, [Yue Zixin] entered the security room with his head tilted, finally able to rest.
0:50:22|0:50:26|At this moment, [Zhang Shaobin] also came out pushing his bicycle, his eyes full of questions.
0:50:26|0:50:32|To uncover the truth, he followed closely behind, carefully riding on the donkey, while the sentry led the donkey to walk slowly.
0:51:26|0:51:30|Zixin couldn't explain the whole story in just a few words.
0:51:35|0:51:36|He heard [Yue Zixin] say so.
0:51:36|0:51:37|The moment bursts into laughter.
0:51:55|0:52:0|Shaobin couldn't hide his joy, while [Yue Zixin] tilted her head and thought for a moment.
0:52:10|0:52:12|[Yue Zixin] can't even close her mouth.
0:52:12|0:52:16|A gentle breeze blew by, and both [Yue Zixin] and [Zhang Shaobin] had smiles on their faces.
0:52:30|0:52:37|[Yue Zixin] felt the clouds in her heart dissipate, enjoying the beautiful moment, with [Zhang Shaobin] behind her seeing everything clearly.
0:52:37|0:52:47|At the hospital entrance, the familiar van appeared again. Before the van could even park, Third Sister hurriedly got out of the car.
0:52:47|0:52:51|Yue Zixin then got off the car and rushed straight into the security room.
0:53:16|0:53:24|After realizing she had been tricked, Yue Zixin quickly directed Zhang Shaobin to drive away, and the two left in a hurry. The security guard was dressed lightly, with only one shoe on his feet, looking very aggrieved.
0:53:28|0:53:36|The more she thought about it, the more wrong it felt. Being bullied for no reason, she didn't even bother to go back and put on clothes, and instead wrote on the signboard at the door.
0:53:39|0:53:45|On the other side, Yue Zixin walked with Zhang Shaobin from the street corner, with Zhang Shaobin riding a bicycle closely behind not far away.
0:53:46|0:53:51|Unexpectedly, a van stood out conspicuously behind the refugees.
0:53:51|0:53:57|At this moment, no one noticed the anomaly behind them and they continued to drive forward.
0:53:57|0:54:7|The car's speed allowed the three sisters to easily catch up with the sentry, then they stopped the car, rolled down the window, and watched the sentry walk away.
0:54:11|0:54:14|This is the restaurant.
0:54:19|0:54:22|After Shaobin finished speaking, he leaned the donkey against the side of the road.
0:54:25|0:54:28|[Yue Zixin] jumped off the donkey with a big stride.
0:54:29|0:54:30|Shaobin tied the donkey to a wooden stake by the side of the road.
0:54:36|0:54:39|He patted the donkey's head, signaling it to stay put obediently.
0:54:39|0:54:44|Got up and went into the restaurant with Ziqing.
0:54:44|0:54:49|Shaobin pulled out a chair for Zixin and sat down across from her.
0:55:22|0:55:24|The boss looked embarrassed and asked.
0:55:36|0:55:38|The boss leaned over and shouted, "Yue Zixin, turn around!"
0:56:2|0:56:8|At this moment, [Zhang Shaobin] also arrived at the restaurant and sat down after confirming that the target person was inside.
0:56:13|0:56:15|[Yue Zixin] gestured in a circular motion as she spoke.
0:56:24|0:56:27|[Zhang Shaobin] finished speaking, and the boss left to take care of other customers.
0:56:27|0:56:32|At the door, Yue Zixin saw the third sister, who had transformed into an old lady with a bamboo cane, and Zhang Shaobin playing an old couple.
0:56:32|0:56:38|Shaohui opened the door, and Yue Zixin rushed in ahead, pushing the old reading glasses, clearly not yet accustomed.
0:56:38|0:56:40|When they saw [Yue Zixin] inside, both of them lit up with excitement.
0:56:40|0:56:44|The two of them quickly reconciled and then found a secluded spot to sit down.
0:56:44|0:56:47|[Zhang Shaobin] was attracted by the two people and turned to look.
0:56:47|0:56:53|The eldest sister, before even sitting down on the stool, kept glancing at [Yue Zixin]'s seat and even took her bag to cover her face.
0:57:3|0:57:7|Yue Zixin took the menu handed by the boss and clapped her hands repeatedly, urging him to leave quickly.
0:57:7|0:57:16|Impatiently, [Zhang Shaobin] tapped [Yue Zixin] on the shoulder.
0:57:16|0:57:19|Liu Ming was attracted by the sound of their conversation.
0:57:36|0:57:40|Upon hearing this clue, [Yue Zixin]'s eyes widened.
0:57:40|0:57:45|Upon hearing this news, others immediately started to scheme in their hearts.
0:57:45|0:57:47|Shaobin nodded in response.
0:57:48|0:57:55|He pointed with his head towards the direction of the TV, but when Zixin turned around, she met eyes with Shaobin sitting below the TV.
0:58:9|0:58:14|He quickly got up and fled from the restaurant, while the sentry hurriedly took out money from his pocket and put it on the table before chasing after him.
0:58:16|0:58:25|[Yue Zixin] watched as the prey escaped, then turned to lean against the glass window to see the direction Purple Heart was leaving. The sentry had just run to the door and turned back, taking the donkey with him.
0:58:25|0:58:30|In the restaurant, [Yue Zixin]'s expression gradually twisted, undoubtedly being silly and getting beaten again.
0:58:35|0:58:36|Yue Zixin whispered to her sisters.
0:58:38|0:58:39|Yue Zixin asks.
0:58:41|0:58:44|Yue Zixin directly scolded and then packed up her things to leave with Zhang Shaobin.
0:58:44|0:58:52|At this moment, [Zhang Shaobin] couldn't sit still anymore. His eyes followed the direction they left in, and after they were far away, he quietly followed them.
0:58:52|0:59:1|The waves were crashing against the water, creating patches of foam. [Yue Zixin] was sitting alone on the shore when suddenly, Zhang Shaobin appeared leading a donkey from a distance.
0:59:1|0:59:11|After searching for a while, [Zhang Shaobin] finally spotted the figure of [Yue Zixin]. As he approached, he tied the donkey to the nearby fence and looked at [Yue Zixin] with concern.
0:59:11|0:59:26|He ran over and squatted in front of [Yue Zixin], asking with concern.
0:59:26|0:59:29|Shaobin hurriedly grabbed Yue Zixin's arm and was about to pull her to the hospital.
0:59:43|0:59:50|Faced with the sentry's question, she was at a loss for words for a moment, pursed her lips and let out a long sigh before speaking.
0:59:53|0:59:55|She shook her head, her eyes filled with confusion.
1:0:0|1:0:9|Zixin seemed to be suddenly awakened by these words, but upon second thought, both sisters were called by her, so she couldn't act too recklessly at this moment.
1:0:9|1:0:21|Watching [Yue Zixin] in distress, [Zhang Shaobin] didn't ask any more questions. He just sat quietly with her by the seaside, feeling the gentle breeze brushing their faces.
1:0:21|1:0:24|[Zixin]'s sudden words warmed her heart.
1:0:29|1:0:32|He patted his chest like a brave knight, with a serious expression.
1:0:42|1:0:46|Shaobin's eyes were full of pity as Yue Zixin reached out and took his arm.
1:1:0|1:1:6|He nodded with a smile, gazing unwaveringly at the man in front of him, feeling a warm surge in his heart. 
1:1:6|1:1:12|His hair danced in the sea breeze, bringing a rare sense of comfort to [Yue Zixin].
1:1:12|1:1:17|He gently leaned his head on the sentinel's shoulder, and the two of them sat on the rocks by the sea, enjoying the sea breeze.
1:1:19|1:1:26|On the road behind, [Zhang Shaobin] watched as the van stopped on the side of the road, with Sanjie leaning against it, gazing at the two figures not far away.
1:1:26|1:1:35|Yue Zixin took the cigarette, held it in her mouth, and Shaohui helped her light it. She took a deep drag and exhaled a thick cloud of smoke.
1:1:35|1:1:41|At this moment, Yue Zixin, riding a bicycle, hurriedly arrived as well. He glanced at the van and then hid beside a nearby car.
1:1:55|1:2:7|Yue Zixin tried to come up with a solution, but noticed Liu Ming following them through the rearview mirror, so she quickly turned around to check.
1:2:25|1:2:28|Reluctantly, the two of them had to discuss the matter at length.
1:2:28|1:2:31|Liu Ming saw the van leaving and rode his bike to catch up.
1:2:31|1:2:37|On the other side, [Zhang Shaobin] is walking by the seaside with a donkey, accompanied by Zixin.
1:2:41|1:2:46|Zixin waved to the person inside, only to see a woman stepping out of the luxury car, looking at the donkey in surprise.
1:2:53|1:3:0|[Zhang Shaobin] was also shocked to hear this, but Zixin, riding on the donkey, proudly patted the donkey's head.
1:3:19|1:3:22|Yue Zixin takes out a jar of cash directly from the bag.
1:3:22|1:3:26|The sentry saw this and went to lead the donkey away directly.
1:3:48|1:3:59|Madam excitedly mounted the donkey. The sentry led the donkey, carrying Zixin and Madam, strolling leisurely on the road by the sea, with smiles on everyone's faces.
1:4:23|1:4:28|Facing the invitation, [Zhang Shaobin] looked at [Yue Zixin], who nodded repeatedly to leave a good impression on [Zhang Shaobin].
1:4:33|1:4:35|[Zhang Shaobin] lowered his head and asked the donkey, and the donkey nodded in agreement.
1:4:37|1:4:40|She then led the donkey towards the direction of the coffee shop.
1:4:40|1:4:44|In the coffee shop, beautiful music is playing as [Yue Zixin] enjoys a delicious piece of cake.
1:4:44|1:4:51|The woman took out water and sprayed it on her face, which caught the curiosity of [Yue Zixin], who kept her eyes fixed on her.
1:4:51|1:4:55|Yue Zixin then took out a powder puff and lightly patted it on her face, with graceful movements.
1:5:34|1:5:39|He looked out the window and saw the van appear in his line of sight again.
1:5:39|1:5:43|He hurriedly lowered his head and covered his face, [Zhang Shaobin] noticed the mud and asked.
1:5:43|1:5:47|He didn't answer anything, still maintaining the posture of covering his face.
1:5:47|1:5:57|At this moment, [Yue Zixin] dropped the utensils in his hand, pushed away the chair, and ran out.
1:5:57|1:5:58|The sentry also chased after them.
1:5:59|1:6:12|Yue Zixin and Zhang Shaobin sat quietly by the sea, with the brilliant twilight glow falling on the sea surface. The donkey beside them seemed to understand the owner's melancholy, and stayed quietly.
1:6:12|1:6:19|[Yue Zixin] slowly opened her eyes, her gaze dim and heavy, she let out a long sigh and said.
1:6:45|1:6:50|His eyes were filled with shock, as if struck by something.
1:6:54|1:6:55|[Yue Zixin] grabbed Shaobin's sleeve.
1:7:0|1:7:7|The sentry helped [Yue Zixin] up, brushed off the sand on her, and then set off again leading the donkey.
1:7:7|1:7:11|By the roadside, Shaohui searched for a long time but couldn't find the figure of [Yue Zixin].
1:7:45|1:7:54|Yue Zixin and Zhang Shaobin decided to try their luck at Shanhaiguan first. Last time the gate closed, the van started, and they set out on the road to find the Star of Death once again.
1:7:54|1:8:0|In the police station, Liu Ming looked at the photo of the missing donkey and the analysis of the case, trying to find some clues from them.
1:8:2|1:8:11|He seemed to have discovered a clue, casually picked up the train of thought diagram, circled the word "gang" and marked a question mark next to it.
1:8:11|1:8:15|He picked up the blueprint, determination shining in his eyes.
1:8:15|1:8:18|He smiled with a meaningful expression at the corner of his mouth.
1:8:18|1:8:25|Shanhaiguan, as the sky gradually darkens, the moon rises in the night sky, surrounded by the sound of cicadas.
1:8:25|1:8:30|[Zhang Shaobin] was seen with his arms crossed, leaning against the van, his eyes slightly opening.
1:8:40|1:8:48|Shahui pushed the person he caught down the hill, the young man slid down to the bottom of the slope, staggered to [Zhang Shaobin], and knelt down with a thud.
1:10:3|1:10:13|In the stone cave, Shaobin and Zixin lit a bonfire here, the fire illuminated the walls of the cave, Shaobin put the wood in his hand on the fire, and Zixin asked with a smile.
1:11:56|1:12:3|On this quiet night, the sentinel's singing was gentle and soothing. Yue Zixin tried several times, secretly resting her head on his shoulder.
1:12:7|1:12:17|Shaobin trembled slightly, and at that moment, the world seemed to quiet down. He was still murmuring the next lyrics in his mouth, but quickly fell silent.
1:12:17|1:12:28|He lifted his arm, gently took the guitar away and placed it aside, afraid that any slight movement would wake Zixin up. Then he bent his legs slightly and rested his arm on his leg.
1:12:30|1:12:35|He lowered his head slightly and looked at the curled up Purple Heart, feeling a sense of peace and contentment in his heart.
1:12:35|1:12:41|He helped [Yue Zixin] tighten the coat on her body, with a gentle touch as if treating a beloved treasure.
1:12:41|1:12:54|He looked down at [Yue Zixin] sleeping peacefully, a faint smile on his lips, unaware that the flickering golden light of the campfire was shining upon them. Zhang Shaobin also gradually drifted off to sleep, until the early morning of the next day.
1:12:55|1:12:59|Only the crowing of the rooster was heard as the sun rose far on the horizon.
1:12:59|1:13:4|In the stone cave, the two of them were pressed against the wall, seemingly still in deep sleep. 
1:13:4|1:13:8|Compared to last night, the bonfire has gone out, and the donkey on the side is nowhere to be seen.
1:13:8|1:13:17|At this moment, Shaobin slowly woke up from his dream, his eyes squinted slightly, then he yawned and turned to look at [Yue Zixin] beside him, a lingering smile still on his lips.
1:13:19|1:13:23|He then turned his head towards Yue Zixin's direction, only to find it empty.
1:13:23|1:13:27|He turned around to help [Yue Zixin] with her clothes, then immediately got up to find the donkey.
1:13:27|1:13:44|He stumbled on a stone, and his loud voice woke up [Yue Zixin]. He looked up at the sentry in confusion and asked,
1:13:44|1:13:48|Both of them ran out of the stone cave in a hurry, looking left and right. [Yue Zixin] noticed,
1:14:2|1:14:9|As soon as Shaobin left, [Yue Zixin] was grabbed by a pair of ruthless hands covering her mouth and dragged away, while struggling to pull the resisting donkey.
1:14:9|1:14:11|At this moment, Yue Zixin caught up with Shaobin.
1:14:13|1:14:28|Zhang Shaobin shouted at him, scaring the young man into letting go of the donkey and running away. However, the experienced soldier Zhang Shaobin quickly caught up with him and easily subdued the young man from behind.
1:14:28|1:14:32|Shaobin turned around when he heard the noise, only to see the police officer [Zhang Shaobin] coming with his companions.
1:14:48|1:14:57|The soldier just got up when the thief took the opportunity to run, but luckily another police officer quickly subdued him.
1:14:57|1:14:59|[Liu Ming] took out his identification from his pocket.
1:15:37|1:15:39|Then they took that girl away.
1:15:47|1:15:54|Upon hearing the news, [Yue Zixin] hurriedly rushed over.
1:15:54|1:15:56|Following closely, [Yue Zixin] followed up.
1:15:56|1:16:4|In an abandoned factory, [Yue Zixin] is tied to a large cart, surrounded by dust, garbage, and the stench of decay, making her feel extremely uncomfortable and panicked.
1:16:4|1:16:10|Her hands and feet were tied up and she couldn't move. [Yue Zixin] dodged back and forth in front of them, staring at her with a deadly look.
1:16:23|1:16:39|Zixin shook her head slowly, and Yue Zixin once again circled around Zixin.
1:16:39|1:16:44|Zixin stared at [Yue Zixin] with a look of resentment, then lowered her eyes and turned her head to the other side.
1:17:4|1:17:8|Shaohui held a wooden stick in his hand, ready to strike as he raised his arm.
1:17:8|1:17:14|At this moment, [Yue Zixin] raised her hand to stop, glanced at the bound Zixin, then pulled Shaohui to the side, her face full of confusion as she spoke.
1:17:31|1:17:41|Shaobin and Liu Ming arrived in time, with Yue Zixin leading the way, placing the knife at Zixing's neck.
1:17:45|1:17:51|Shaohui rushed forward with a stick, but was quickly subdued by the refugees.
1:18:14|1:18:16|[Yue Zixin] waved his hand, ready to strike down.
1:18:16|1:18:22|Shaobin pushed Yue Zixin aside and took the knife from her hand.
1:18:22|1:18:35|Shaohui kicked Liu Ming away and hit Shaobin with a wooden stick.
1:18:35|1:18:40|[Yue Zixin] is tied up, with a look of helplessness and despair in her eyes, calling out her name over and over again.
1:18:42|1:18:49|Yue Zixin gently lifted his head with his hand, and saw him open his eyes.
1:18:53|1:19:0|The police car roared along the road, accompanied by the sound of sirens, [Yue Zixin] and Zhang Shaobin were quickly taken to the hospital for treatment.
1:19:0|1:19:5|Zhang Shaobin sat in the ward checking, while Liu Ming waited anxiously at the door.
1:19:5|1:19:10|[Yue Zixin] sat on a bench in the corridor, head down, with a look of anxiety on her face and a furrowed brow.
1:19:10|1:19:16|At this moment, Zhang Shaobin walked out of the ward and saluted Liu Ming who was standing beside him.
1:20:14|1:20:17|[Yue Zixin] hesitated for a moment, feeling guilty as she lowered her head, furrowing her brows, and then said.
1:20:49|1:20:53|Zhang Shaobin led the donkey and walked back with Zixin.
1:20:53|1:21:1|Suddenly, Yue Zixin and Zhang Shaobin rushed out from both sides, blocking the donkey directly in front.
1:21:14|1:21:19|Seeing the situation change, they attempted to turn around and escape, but how could the police give them a chance?
1:21:19|1:21:27|Three police cars surrounded from different directions, and the police officers quickly got out of the cars and started chasing. In just a few moments, they managed to pin [Yue Zixin] to the ground.
1:21:27|1:21:30|On the other side, [Zhang Shaobin] was also successfully arrested and fell into the hands of the law.
1:21:32|1:21:36|When the handcuffs were put on, there was no turning back for them.
1:21:36|1:21:40|Everyone breathed a sigh of relief when the villain was captured.
1:21:40|1:21:46|The police escorted the two of them, stumbling, to the front of the crowd, with [Yue Zixin] gasping for breath.
1:21:59|1:22:7|[Yue Zixin] and Zhang Shaobin were captured and brought to justice, awaiting the consequences of their mistakes.
1:22:45|1:22:49|Upon hearing these words, [Yue Zixin] blushed and lowered her head.
1:23:23|1:23:24|Zixin smiled happily after Zixing finished speaking.
1:24:24|1:24:36|The two of them went home bickering like this.
1:24:36|1:24:42|The next morning, a lot of relatives gathered at [Zhang Shaobin]'s house to see the donkey, and everyone had a lively time together.
1:24:42|1:24:48|The donkey's face is covered with a cloth, [Zhang Shaobin]'s father leads the donkey to pull the cart.
1:24:48|1:24:53|Outside the courtyard wall, three young men are standing watching the donkey, and [Zhang Shaobin]'s father is laughing so hard that he can't close his mouth.
1:24:57|1:25:1|Zhang Shaobin came out with a plate of fresh tofu.
1:25:1|1:25:5|He raised his arm, letting Zixin smell the aroma of the tofu.
1:25:5|1:25:19|The two of them were playfully joking around, and this scene happened to be seen by [Yue Zixin]'s mother.
1:25:33|1:25:38|Yue Zixin was puzzled, staring at her mother's back for a long time.
1:25:38|1:25:38|Indoors.
1:26:0|1:26:1|Shaobin looked helpless.
1:26:46|1:26:56|After they finished speaking, Yue Zixin's parents left, leaving Zhang Shaobin sitting on the bed looking troubled. It was at this moment that he truly understood his own feelings.
1:26:56|1:26:59|Night falls, and the table at [Zhang Shaobin]'s home is filled with delicious dishes.
1:27:29|1:27:35|Shaobin kept serving dishes to [Yue Zixin] non-stop.
1:27:35|1:27:39|[Yue Zixin] also naturally serves him some dishes.
1:27:39|1:27:43|The elderly couple both looked a bit uncomfortable when they saw this scene.
1:27:59|1:28:4|[Yue Zixin]'s smile froze on her face, the atmosphere at the dining table became awkward, tears welled up in her eyes.
1:28:13|1:28:16|He stood there, at a loss for words, unsure of how to explain.
1:28:26|1:28:29|[Yue Zixin] looked at him with tears in her eyes, a smile squeezing out at the corner of her mouth.
1:28:38|1:28:41|He lowered his head, choked up, afraid of being noticed for any abnormality.
1:28:45|1:28:54|Late at night, with the bright moon hanging high in the sky, [Zhang Shaobin] couldn't fall asleep at all. He stood in the courtyard, gazing at the moon above, lost in thought.
1:28:54|1:29:2|He then lowered his head and looked at the donkey in front of him, feeling a thousand regrets and a thousand reluctances in his heart.
1:29:2|1:29:8|He walked over and gently stroked the donkey's face, his parents' actions causing unbearable anxiety in his heart.
1:29:10|1:29:21|He lowered his head slightly and looked at the donkey, as if trying to find some answers from it, and as if reminiscing about the bits and pieces that had happened between them.
1:29:21|1:29:26|In the new house, [Yue Zixin] curled up in the corner, memories of the past vividly in sight.
1:29:42|1:29:51|He slightly smirked, but when he looked up and saw the character "å–œ" in front of him, sadness surged back into his heart, recalling the dinner just now.
1:29:57|1:30:1|This sentence is like a thorn, stabbing [Yue Zixin] over and over again.
1:30:1|1:30:7|He looked around, gazing at the fiery red decorations in the new house, feeling a sense of grievance and confusion in his heart.
1:30:7|1:30:13|Everything in front of me feels so real, the table covered with delicate flowers, and the character "å–œ" hanging all over the ceiling.
1:30:13|1:30:18|These moments constantly remind him that there is no room for any fantasies.
1:30:18|1:30:21|He seemed to have woken up from a dream, but was reluctant to leave for a long time.
1:30:22|1:30:28|There is no longer the longing and joy in the eyes, only endless sadness is revealed.
1:30:28|1:30:36|He kept replaying his father's voice in his head, tears uncontrollably flowing from the depths of his soul, just like a spring.
1:30:36|1:30:40|Outside the room, [Zhang Shaobin] hesitated at the door, but hesitated to enter.
1:30:40|1:30:46|In the room, [Yue Zixin] seemed to sense his presence, gently turning her moist cheeks towards the door.
1:30:47|1:30:51|[Zhang Shaobin] raised his arm, the hand that was about to knock on the door hanging in midair.
1:30:51|1:30:57|[Yue Zixin] also sat up from the bed, listening attentively while waiting at the door.
1:30:57|1:31:1|The commotion outside the door made her certain that the person who had come was [Zhang Shaobin].
1:31:1|1:31:9|She leaned against the door, a smile spreading across her face, waiting for the person she had been longing for to walk in at any moment.
1:31:9|1:31:12|[Zhang Shaobin] lingered outside the door for a long time, unsure of what to do next.
1:31:13|1:31:16|[Yue Zixin] went from being pleasantly surprised at the beginning to gradually becoming disappointed.
1:31:16|1:31:20|[Yue Zixin] leaned against the wall, as if unable to control her emotions any longer.
1:31:20|1:31:25|Tears once again slid down her cheeks, her hands clenched into fists, crying out in pain.
1:31:25|1:31:31|At this moment, both Yue Zixin and Zhang Shaobin were in great agony, waiting for each other to provide an explanation.
1:31:31|1:31:34|[Yue Zixin] slowly closed her eyes and silently shed tears.
1:31:34|1:31:42|Shaobin didn't understand when Zixin shed tears, the tears contained deep affection, love but unattainable, yet helpless, which made her suffer unbearably.
1:31:43|1:31:47|The sentry outside the door raised his hand several times to knock, but hesitated each time.
1:31:47|1:31:53|His expression was anxious, not knowing how to face [Yue Zixin], and not knowing what else to say.
1:31:54|1:32:6|A door stood between the two, a door that represented an inexplicable misunderstanding, becoming a barrier between them. Shaobin pondered for a while, then lifted his head, his eyes filled with helplessness.
1:32:6|1:32:13|[Yue Zixin] is beautiful. She knows she is not worthy of [Zhang Shaobin], so she finally makes up her mind and walks away.
1:32:13|1:32:21|Upon hearing the sound of someone leaving outside the door, [Yue Zixin]'s heart, which had been stirred, sank once again, as if encased in frost.
1:32:21|1:32:23|The once beautiful moments have become elusive and ethereal.
1:32:25|1:32:33|The sorrowful emotion was like a storm, coming swiftly and making him feel extremely lost.
1:32:33|1:32:42|In the joyous new house, [Zhang Shaobin] lay on his back and cried in pain, his curled-up body trembling slightly, his delicate face wet with tears.
1:32:42|1:32:51|In the room, [Zhang Shaobin]'s parents waited for a long time, but they didn't see [Zhang Shaobin] coming in to sleep. The elderly couple sat by the bed, sighing sadly.
1:32:51|1:32:54|The lantern by the window swayed with the breeze, tonight destined for a sleepless night.
1:32:57|1:33:0|In the early morning, [Yue Zixin] has already started working.
1:33:0|1:33:3|The sentry family is busy grinding beans on the side.
1:33:26|1:33:27|Uncle Yue Zixin looked disdainful.
1:35:29|1:35:37|He walked past everyone and approached the donkey.
1:35:41|1:35:47|Her tears fell uncontrollably as she spoke.
1:35:47|1:35:54|She leaned close to the donkey's ear and whispered softly.
1:35:54|1:35:57|Just like telling [Zhang Shaobin] who was standing beside.
1:35:57|1:36:2|She wiped away the tears on her face, turned around and bid farewell as she left.
1:36:2|1:36:5|The sentry wanted to chase after, but was stopped by [Yue Zixin].
1:36:8|1:36:16|Oh, you... Shaobin stood there dumbfounded, while Er Shu quickly turned around and waved goodbye.
1:36:16|1:36:23|Watching Yue Zixin's slender figure, he wiped away his tears, ran away, and Uncle Er was full of regret.
1:36:23|1:36:29|In the room, [Zhang Shaobin] is leaning against the wooden cabinet lost in thought.
1:36:29|1:36:32|[Zhang Shaobin] showed no intention of getting up, as Auntie Yue arrived at the door of the room.
1:36:38|1:36:42|At this moment, the whole family gathered outside Shaobin's room, and Second Uncle hurriedly asked.
1:37:31|1:37:36|Hearing a familiar voice, [Yue Zixin] sprang up from the bed and rushed out the door.
1:37:36|1:37:51|At this moment, he couldn't wait any longer, taking big strides towards his resolute heart, a joyful smile on his face. The sunlight fell on his running figure, unable to suppress the impulse in his heart any longer, the sprout of love had already burst forth.
1:37:52|1:38:9|Scenes from the past flashed before his eyes like a movie. He smiled gently, leaning lightly on his shoulder, accompanying him to admire the seaside scenery. These memories made every step of [Yue Zixin] more determined, more confident in his choices.
1:38:9|1:38:15|This time, he finally no longer troubled by the so-called worldly concerns, no longer agonizing over whether he is worthy of the other person.
1:38:16|1:38:26|He ran madly for his beloved one just because he is Yue Zixin, the one on the wall in new clothes, already waiting here.
1:38:26|1:38:32|His face was full of smiles, waiting quietly for [Zhang Shaobin] to come to his side.
1:38:32|1:38:37|Zhang Shaobin ran over panting, the two recognized each other without saying a word.
1:38:37|1:38:40|The sound of panting mixed with joy, tears welled up in the eyes of [Yue Zixin] and [Zhang Shaobin].
1:38:50|1:39:5|Yue Zixin and Zhang Shaobin took a step forward, tears of excitement swirling in their eyes. Just as they were about to embrace, they were blocked by the donkey in the middle, and both of them touched the donkey's head.
