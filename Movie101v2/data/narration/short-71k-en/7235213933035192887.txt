0:0:39|0:0:49|The film begins with a luxurious small car slowly driving on a winding road, circling around the mountain top and driving upwards in circles.
0:0:49|0:1:2|On one side of the road are towering steep cliffs, while on the other side is a low-line gorge. The roaring car speeds through the mountain road, stirring up the dry branches and leaves on the ground, causing the leaves to swirl in the air like dancing butterflies.
0:1:2|0:1:9|The road is surrounded by mountains, with forests and scattered raindrops on both sides, and in the distance, there are overlapping hills and lush greenery.
0:1:10|0:1:15|The camera pulls back to reveal that the canyon floor is actually a series of lakes rippling outwards.
0:1:15|0:1:22|In this fragrant garden, the car accelerated without any hesitation towards its destination.
0:1:22|0:1:26|The car slowed down, indicating that the destination was approaching.
0:1:26|0:1:32|After a while, a small car drove into the village, and several men stood by the roadside welcoming them.
0:1:32|0:1:36|The men waved their hands while anxiously opening their umbrellas.
0:1:56|0:2:2|The man who had removed his makeup and changed his shoes was surrounded by a crowd, while four women on the side were playing mahjong under their voices.
0:2:44|0:2:50|The fourth brother [Zhang Bei] is the director of the flour factory, and the fifth brother [Zhang Zhong] is a big bully in the village.
0:3:9|0:3:14|A winding corridor, surrounded by lush vegetation, appeared in front of them.
0:3:14|0:3:17|The crowd surrounded [Zhang Nan] as they walked into the long corridor.
0:3:17|0:3:21|At the end of the corridor is a magnificent mansion.
0:3:21|0:3:25|The room is built against the mountain, and the interior decoration is grand and luxurious.
0:4:9|0:4:13|[Zhang Nan] brushed the documents in his hand onto the table and took off the sunglasses from his face.
0:4:48|0:4:52|Xiao Hu took the phone.
0:4:52|0:4:58|He looked at his phone with a smile, by the pond in the village, [Lin Chunhu] and the villagers were checking on the side.
0:5:4|0:5:11|If there is a problem with the water quality, [Lin Chunhu] hurriedly ran out, while the old lady stood calmly on the roof.
0:5:35|0:5:40|The villagers quickly picked up a basin of straw and piled up a thick protective pad under the house.
0:5:40|0:5:46|The villagers looked up at the old lady, and [Lin Genxing] knelt down without saying a word, looking at his mother.
0:6:36|0:6:39|The old lady squatted down, tears streaming down her face.
0:6:39|0:6:40|[Lin Chunhu] takes the handed-over document.
0:10:14|0:10:16|The two brothers nodded with a look of shame on their faces.
0:10:16|0:10:21|In the village, the narrow alleyways are filled with the traces of time, presenting a peaceful scene.
0:10:21|0:10:27|[Secretary Lao] and others walked out of the village committee with smiles on their faces, welcoming the arrival of [Village Chief Yang].
0:11:14|0:11:15|The old secretary led everyone into the village committee, into the village's small shop.
0:12:37|0:12:49|In the lush forest, a stream meandered through the middle, with several figures cautiously making their way through the trees.
0:13:7|0:13:10|[Zhang Xiaobao] hurriedly walked forward, looking for a good angle.
0:13:10|0:13:14|[Liu Mengting] walked cautiously to the west side and sat on a rock.
0:13:26|0:13:28|[Liu Mengting] stood up and walked to [Zhang Xiaobao]'s side.
0:14:11|0:14:13|[Liu Mengting] looked down at the negatives in the camera.
0:14:27|0:14:37|[Liu Mengting] turned around with a pout and walked away, [Zhang Xiaobao] scratched his head and quickly caught up. The two figures disappeared into the woods.
0:15:43|0:15:47|[Liu Mengting] interrupted [Zhang Xiaobao]'s words, and the two walked towards the village.
0:15:47|0:15:53|The tranquil and quaint alley was deep and narrow, with an old man sitting quietly on a chair in front of his house.
0:15:53|0:16:2|In the room, the medicine pot is steaming on the fire. [Liu Mengting] lifts the medicine pot with both hands and pours the medicine into a bowl, then holds the bowl in her hands and walks out of the kitchen.
0:16:2|0:16:4|She sat by Lin Chunhu's bed.
0:16:13|0:16:16|[Lin Chunhu] blows on the cooling medicine and carefully feeds it to the elderly lady.
0:16:16|0:16:20|[Zhang Nan] is on the side taking candid photos of [Liu Mengting].
0:17:12|0:17:16|A man is holding a pig's head to cover his face.
0:18:6|0:18:10|The two households living there were too scared to move out no matter what.
0:18:54|0:18:59|[Zhang Dong] pursed his lips, looking at [Zhang Baoliang] with a serious expression.
0:20:3|0:20:8|[Zhang Nan] raised his hand, stopping [Zhang Baoliang] from speaking, and pondered for a moment.
0:20:18|0:20:24|[Zhang Baoliang] looked affectionately at [Lin Dong], and the two of them walked out of the room together, while the villagers walked in groups of two or three on the other side.
0:20:50|0:20:52|[Zhang Nan] hurriedly went up to greet [Chief Yang].
0:21:31|0:21:35|[Liu Mengting] led everyone down the stone bridge, the surrounding scenery was picturesque.
0:21:35|0:21:40|As everyone hurried towards the election assembly, [Lin Chunhu] rushed over from around the corner.
0:22:50|0:22:52|In an office. 
0:22:59|0:23:2|The scene shifts, with [Lin Chunhu] leading [Zhang Nan] around for a tour.
0:24:56|0:25:1|The two walked along the path, chatting and laughing. [Lin Chunhu] did not answer the question just now.
0:25:1|0:25:5|The next morning, [Old Secretary] met [Lin Chunhu] in the corridor.
0:26:0|0:26:2|Lin Chunhu was at a loss for words and didn't know how to respond.
0:26:58|0:27:6|[Lin Chunhu] returned to his office with a turtle in his hand, sitting on the office chair and looking at the turtle on the desk.
0:27:24|0:27:35|[Liu Mengting] sighed repeatedly, then reached out to pick up the turtle on the table. She carefully examined it over and over, but it seemed there was nothing unusual about it.
0:27:35|0:27:42|She suddenly thought of something, quickly put down the turtle, clapped her hands, took out her phone, dialed a number, and put it to her ear.
0:27:46|0:27:48|Lin Chunhu and Zhang Nan meet at the pond.
0:28:7|0:28:10|[Liu Mengting] is collecting water from the pond with a bottle.
0:28:23|0:28:31|In the past few years, we also used the water in the stream, with [Lin Chunhu] looking worried, in the luxurious villa on the other side.
0:28:45|0:28:48|[Zhang Nan] looked up, his expression unwavering as he pondered.
0:29:14|0:29:20|By the pond, [Liu Mengting] anxiously holds a report and hurries towards [Lin Chunhu] standing on the path in the middle of the pond.
0:30:5|0:30:13|In the restaurant, the [Zhang brothers] were casually dining together, raising their heads to look at the wine in their glasses.
0:30:13|0:30:17|[Zhang Nan] hesitated for a moment before taking a seat and spoke.
0:31:25|0:31:30|[Lin Chunhu] drank up the wine in his hand without hesitation.
0:31:34|0:31:45|[Zhang Nan] spoke up to stop his younger brother.
0:31:45|0:31:49|[Zhang Dong] looked at the little brother beside him and winked at him.
0:31:49|0:31:52|Lin Chunhu immediately stood up from the meeting and walked out of the room.
0:31:52|0:31:58|[Zhang Dong] looked at [Liu Mengting] and [Lin Chunhu] with a smile, and he adjusted his suit.
0:34:25|0:34:27|[Zhang Nan] looked at the backs of the two and shook his head mockingly.
0:34:27|0:34:30|He picked up his phone from the car, dialed a number, and waited for a moment.
0:35:0|0:35:3|[Lin Chunhu] and [Zhang Nan] are filled with worry.
0:35:3|0:35:8|Uncle Baoliang hurried forward and pointed at the two of them.
0:35:21|0:35:36|Lin Chunhu arrogantly made threats, saying he tore up the test report in his hand and threw the paper scraps on the faces of the two. Then, in a fit of anger, he threw them again. [Lin Chunhu] pointed at him, but he ignored and left in a huff.
0:36:23|0:36:27|Then their family's five brothers, Lin Chunhu and Zhang Nan, became even more lawless.
0:36:39|0:36:42|Back home, Lin Chunhu still had an angry look on his face.
0:37:59|0:38:3|The scene shifts, with Lin Mengting walking quickly on the bridge, and Zhang Xiaobao catching up and shouting.
0:38:3|0:38:5|He reached out and grabbed [Liu Mengting]'s arm.
0:39:7|0:39:13|Liu Mengting turned around in frustration and walked away, leaving [Zhang Xiaobao] standing still behind her, at a loss.
0:39:13|0:39:18|[Zhang Nan] carried a gift, opened the courtyard gate, looked around and shouted.
0:39:22|0:39:28|[Lin Genxing] poked his head out of the room.
0:39:28|0:39:32|[Zhang Nan] walked towards the table in the courtyard and placed the gift in his hand on the table.
0:40:13|0:40:22|[Lin Genxing] sees [Zhang Xi] off, looking at the gifts on the table with a big smile on his face. He opens the package, takes out the drink inside, and is about to open it when it is pressed down by a board.
0:41:32|0:41:38|[Lin Genxing] walked out of the yard with an unopened bottle of milk, looking at the hundred yuan his father had given him.
0:41:40|0:41:43|After saying that, [Lin Chunhu] put the money in his pocket and left.
0:41:43|0:41:46|On the other side, [Zhang Nan] was sweeping the yard with an ugly expression.
0:42:30|0:42:35|The man walked into the house with a gift, while his wife continued to clean the yard.
0:42:35|0:42:40|In the home of [Zhang Baoliang], he wore an apron and carried delicious food, then leaned in for a kiss, very satisfied.
0:42:57|0:43:0|[Lin Chunhu] sat down and watched the entrance of the restaurant.
0:43:1|0:43:5|The son walked in slowly with a camera in his hand.
0:44:0|0:44:2|[Lin Chunhu] looks at his son who remains silent.
0:44:7|0:44:9|The son picked up the camera and handed it to [Lin Chunhu].
0:44:27|0:44:34|[Lin Chunhu] flipped through the photos in the camera and happened to see the scene where Chunhu was giving Aunt He a cigarette.
0:44:34|0:44:40|[Lin Chunhu] looked shocked, glanced at his son, and stared at the photo with a serious expression, lost in thought.
0:44:40|0:44:48|Some time later, the village committee officially started the election meeting for the party branch. The villagers sat below the stage discussing in a flurry.
0:45:51|0:45:53|[Zhang Nan] stood up under the push of [Zhang Xi].
0:45:58|0:46:3|[Zhang Dong] walked out with sunglasses on, hands in pockets, and his younger brother followed suit back to his seat.
0:46:3|0:46:7|[Zhang Nan] swayed and staggered, casually stepping onto the steps.
0:46:7|0:46:12|He glanced at the judges on the stage with a disdainful attitude, walking along the edge of the podium.
0:46:12|0:46:22|He blew out a breath, then took off the sunglasses on his face, glanced back at [Secretary Lao] and others sitting behind him, and then hung the sunglasses in the pocket on his chest.
0:46:22|0:46:24|He walked with his hands on his hips in the middle of the stage.
0:47:36|0:47:39|Applause rang out as many villagers shook their heads.
0:49:21|0:49:32|The young man hung up the phone while driving, then suddenly accelerated, the car swiftly weaving through the village.
0:49:32|0:49:40|[Lin Chunhu] smiled and waved to the villagers, then walked up to the stage to give a speech.
0:49:40|0:49:48|He bowed respectfully and humbly to the judges, then turned and bowed to the villagers.
0:52:11|0:52:16|The villagers stepped forward one by one to receive their ballot papers.
0:52:16|0:52:20|At the ticket counter, Lin Chunhu carefully fills out the ballot in his hand.
0:52:20|0:52:24|After finishing writing, he took off his glasses, held the ticket, and turned to leave.
0:52:24|0:52:27|The next person sat down in his place.
0:52:27|0:52:30|[Zhang Nan] stood on tiptoe, trying to get a closer look, but was pushed down.
0:52:30|0:52:34|[Secretary Lao] took the lead in casting his ballot into the ballot box.
0:52:34|0:52:38|The villagers cast their votes one after another.
0:52:38|0:52:39|The scene is well-organized.
0:53:40|0:53:47|Accompanied by the applause of the villagers, the five people stood up and walked towards the stage, with [Lin Chunhu]’s younger brother running into the village committee with a photo.
0:54:14|0:54:16|It's all for this election.
0:54:37|0:54:41|I finally caught a glimpse of [Zhang Nan], and I saw her giving a gift to [Lin Chunhu].
0:55:23|0:55:23|Someone chooses the president.
0:57:14|0:57:21|[Village Chief Yang] heard the news, got up and walked to the door, where he saw two elderly people. He hurriedly went to greet them, and the old people held his hand.
0:58:31|0:58:37|Village Chief Yang pondered as he watched the old man's back, while [Zhang Dong] on the other side was still hosting a grand banquet.
0:58:54|0:58:57|[Zhang Dong] raised his glass to toast the brothers at the table.
0:59:23|0:59:26|[Lin Chunhu] has been disqualified again.
0:59:39|0:59:41|[Zhang Dong] raised his hand to stop everyone.
1:1:6|1:1:8|[Liu Mengting] throws the photo towards [Zhang Xiaobao].
1:1:11|1:1:13|[Zhang Xiaobao] looked at the photo with great confusion.
1:1:42|1:1:46|[Liu Mengting] turned her back to [Zhang Xiaobao] in frustration, and [Zhang Xiaobao] grabbed [Liu Mengting] and turned her around.
1:2:2|1:2:5|[Zhang Xiaobao] anxiously shifted his feet, unsure of how to explain.
1:2:29|1:2:32|After speaking, [Zhang Nan] left the bamboo forest without looking back.
1:2:32|1:2:37|[Liu Mengting] stood still, at a loss, and slowly squatted down, staring blankly.
1:2:37|1:2:41|Lin Chunhu's figure gradually disappeared into the bamboo forest.
1:2:41|1:2:45|In the home of [Zhang Baoliang], a whale swims carefreely in the fish tank.
1:2:45|1:2:50|[Zhang Baoliang] bent down to look at the whale, and Xiao Bao flashed past him from behind.
1:2:50|1:2:55|[Zhang Baoliang] turned his head, shook it, and continued to watch the whale excitedly.
1:2:55|1:2:58|At this moment, Xiao Bao quickly ran down the stairs.
1:3:28|1:3:30|[Zhang Baoliang] turned around and sat on the stool, picking up the newspaper.
1:4:48|1:4:51|[Zhang Baoliang] took out a camera from under the table, Little Bao snatched it and turned away.
1:5:8|1:5:15|Xiaobao, without looking back at his father's reprimand, walked out of the house with a determined and resolute expression, without hesitation.
1:5:15|1:5:21|He walked through one quaint alley after another, holding a camera, not daring to stop for a moment.
1:5:21|1:5:25|He ran out of the alley, looking extremely anxious.
1:5:25|1:5:29|He walked through the village and finally stepped into the gate of the village committee.
1:5:29|1:5:32|At this moment, [Village Chief Yang] was also asking the villagers about the situation.
1:5:57|1:6:2|Captain Yang looked at the photos in his camera, and the truth about the smuggling operation was finally revealed.
1:6:16|1:6:23|Our village investigation team conducted a comprehensive investigation into this matter.
1:6:28|1:6:35|After various investigations, this [Lin Chunhu] did not exhibit any suspicious behavior.
1:6:53|1:7:0|Confirming him as the candidate for the new village party branch secretary of our Camellia Village.
1:7:12|1:7:20|One of the candidates [Zhang Dong] exhibited behavior that would make him a suitable choice.
1:7:29|1:7:31|Revoke his position as the deputy party secretary this time.
1:7:43|1:7:48|[Zhang Nan] got up and left.
1:7:48|1:7:54|On the other side, [Zhang Dong] drove with a heavy expression, while his younger brother sat nervously beside him without saying a word.
1:8:10|1:8:16|The younger brother opened the car door and walked out, looking at [Zhang Dong] inside the car.
1:8:16|1:8:17|The car starts and drives away.
1:8:20|1:8:28|The younger brother watched as [Zhang Nan]'s car gradually drove away, leaving [Zhang Nan] driving alone on the road, appearing calm, while Xu Ze was furious.
1:8:28|1:8:37|Lin Chunhu slowly parked the car by the roadside, got out of the car, slammed the door shut, took a turn, and then kicked the door hard.
1:8:37|1:8:45|He leaned against the car door, banging his head hard against the door frame with both hands. From then on, the village finally returned to calm.
1:8:45|1:8:53|The ancient buildings still stand in the village, with lanterns swaying gently under the eaves. On the other side, [Liu Mengting] is giving villagers a popular science lesson.
1:10:42|1:10:45|[Liu Mengting] smiled as she escorted the villagers away.
1:11:16|1:11:23|[Lin Chunhu] handed the ticket to [Zhang Nan], who lowered her head to look at the beautiful countryside photography exhibition ticket in her hand.
1:11:23|1:11:29|In the blink of an eye, she stepped through the doors of the photography exhibition, looking at the wall full of photos, feeling infinite emotions in her heart.
1:11:29|1:11:37|In the center of the photo is the figure of [Zhang Nan], who walks to her photo and looks at it quietly, with a highly infectious smile on her face.
1:11:38|1:11:49|At this moment, [Zhang Nan] also appeared behind [Liu Mengting]. [Zhang Nan] stood behind without saying a word. [Liu Mengting] turned around to look at [Zhang Nan] behind her, the silence between them spoke louder than words.
1:11:49|1:12:4|[Zhang Xiaobao] smiled at [Liu Mengting], but the love in her eyes gradually faded. [Liu Mengting] looked at her with a genuine smile, and the two of them let go of their past grievances. There was no more resentment in their hearts, life continued moving forward, and the future was full of brightness.
