0:0:16|0:0:27|With the sound of the telegraph, the time is set in 1931. Japan brazenly launched the September 18th Incident, leading to the fall of Northeast China and the urgent situation in North China. Chiang Kai-shek adopted a policy of non-resistance and launched a frenzied encirclement campaign against the Red Army.
0:0:27|0:0:33|The Chinese Communist Party is forced to go underground, and the underground party in Liucheng, located in North China, faces an unprecedented life-and-death test.
0:0:34|0:0:45|At night, Old Ghost was using a camera to document files when he looked up and saw [Lu Xiao] pointing a gun at him.
0:0:45|0:0:53|He gestured for [Lu Xiao] to look behind him. At that moment, Lao Gui snatched [Lu Xiao]'s gun, reversed it to the ground, and used his foot to trip [Lu Xiao].
0:0:53|0:0:58|The old ghost ran out in a flash, and when [Lu Xiao] reacted, he immediately picked up the pistol and turned to chase.
0:1:2|0:1:13|A small car slowly drove into the gate of the Nationalist Army Corps. Inside the courtyard, soldiers marched in neat rows. The car arrived at the entrance of the corps building, where Commander Che Linlin was waiting.
0:1:13|0:1:19|Lu Xiao then got out of the passenger seat and walked to the side of Che Linlin's car. Che Linlin nodded towards the car.
0:1:23|0:1:29|Lu Xiao gets out of the car at the entrance of the school campus, crossing his arms in front of his chest and looking around.
0:1:29|0:1:34|[Che Linlin] smiled and saluted the man, who raised his hand in return.
0:1:50|0:1:52|The group then walked towards the building.
0:2:27|0:2:35|At this moment, the screen shows the movie title "Special Mission", with the man [Hong Zichen] walking side by side with Che Linlin in the front, followed by [Lu Xiao].
0:3:20|0:3:24|At this moment, [Che Linlin] walked out of the meeting room and slammed the door angrily.
0:3:30|0:3:36|[Che Linlin] watched as [Hong Zichen] began to reminisce. Outside the house, a woman was begging in the snow, with [Hong Zichen] also present.
0:5:10|0:5:15|Che Linlin's nodding motion came to a halt, as everyone stared thoughtfully at Hong Zichen.
0:5:15|0:5:19|[Hong Zichen] sat calmly, crossing his hands on the table.
0:5:38|0:5:40|[Hong Zichen] raised the wine glass.
0:5:44|0:5:45|[Hong Zichen] smiled and raised a toast to [Che Linlin].
0:5:45|0:5:47|Che Linlin splashed the wine on her face.
0:5:47|0:5:50|Mo Hand stood in place with a glass of wine in hand.
0:5:50|0:5:52|Everyone present was speechless.
0:5:52|0:5:54|The scene shifts to [Che Linlin]'s room.
0:7:7|0:7:26|At this moment, [Che Linlin] was crying heavily, shaking her head as she walked towards the door by the mountain. Only [Che Linlin] was left standing still, memories piercing her heart like a sharp dagger. She let the tears slide down her face, turned around, and her powerless hands swayed with her body.
0:7:37|0:7:40|The scene shows a Japanese person committing a crime.
0:7:44|0:7:47|Mo Han frowned as he listened.
0:8:12|0:8:17|Mo Han seemed lost in thought, then suddenly stood up.
0:8:39|0:8:58|[Che Linlin] turned around, the mirror was empty with no one in sight. Mo Han, who was behind her, had disappeared. A military officer was coming out of the second-floor office. Mo Han quickly hid in a compartment at the bottom of the stairs. After the officer walked away, he swiftly ran up the stairs, reached the second floor, and tiptoed towards the door of the office.
0:8:58|0:9:15|His steps were light and swift, yet he didn't forget to look back around. He lowered his body, slowed down his pace, and the confidential room was getting closer. He looked back again to make sure no one was following before continuing forward. The surrounding windows seemed like pairs of eyes, staring at him breathlessly.
0:9:44|0:9:46|Mo Han lowered his head.
0:10:0|0:10:3|After Station Shan finished laughing, she randomly went downstairs with [Hong Zichen].
0:10:3|0:10:8|There was a bow, [Hong Zichen] put a piece of paper into his pocket and walked calmly towards the telephone booth behind him.
0:10:8|0:10:16|The pedestrians outside the door were constantly coming and going. He dialed the number, his eyes occasionally glancing outside the door, and the brief wait felt as long as a century.
0:10:20|0:10:48|He had no expression on his face, holding a headset in his left hand, slightly lowering his head and lowering his voice. The tour guide behind him was greeting guests, his eyes unusually alert, the fleeting shadows of pedestrians constantly flickering in his eyes. In the room, a map was slowly unfolded, and a group of people gathered around the table.
0:10:55|0:10:57|The man points at the map with his finger.
0:11:1|0:11:4|The scene changes, and the soldiers stand in a row.
0:11:31|0:11:33|[Hong Zichen] is holding his stomach and frowning.
0:11:37|0:11:43|The scene shifts, Mu Han prepares to push open the toilet door, but hesitates, pacing anxiously back and forth at the doorway.
0:11:43|0:11:47|Suddenly, he remembered something and then strode towards a room.
0:11:47|0:11:52|In the room, there was only one table, a few chairs, and some old newspapers.
0:11:52|0:11:54|There is a telephone on the table.
0:11:54|0:11:59|Muhan opened the door, glanced around for a moment, then walked quietly towards the phone.
0:11:59|0:12:0|He turned around and closed the door.
0:12:0|0:12:11|Hong Zichen walked to the table with a swift step, picked up the phone, dialed the numbers on the dial, and glanced back anxiously, waiting for the other end to pick up the call.
0:12:11|0:12:19|At this moment, [Mo Han] clutched the phone like a life-saving straw, his brows furrowed and his expression stiff.
0:12:25|0:12:28|[Che Linlin] glanced at her watch, showing an impatient expression.
0:12:28|0:12:32|[Lu Xiao] immediately walked towards the direction of the restroom after hearing the instructions.
0:12:32|0:12:35|And at this moment, [Mo Han] was still anxiously waiting.
0:12:35|0:12:41|In the room, [Mo Han] weakly puts down the receiver, she lowers her head and frowns in thought, tightly gripping the phone with both hands.
0:12:41|0:12:47|Suddenly, she turned around and immediately hid behind the cabinet at the door.
0:12:47|0:12:51|At this moment, [Lu Xiao] kept searching for her and soon arrived at the entrance of the restroom.
0:12:55|0:13:0|The video showed no response, so [Hong Zichen] forcefully opened the restroom door, prohibiting entry into the restroom.
0:13:2|0:13:7|Lu Xiao entered the restroom and, receiving no response, proceeded to open the door of one of the cubicles.
0:13:7|0:13:15|He opened the first door, which was empty, then turned to the second door, but still couldn't find any trace of [Che Linlin].
0:13:15|0:13:19|He reached out to pull the third door open, and when he did, it was still empty inside.
0:13:19|0:13:23|With a furrowed brow, [Hong Zichen] pulled out a handgun from his pocket and rushed towards the restroom.
0:13:23|0:13:27|He held the gun in his right hand, supported it with his left hand, and vigilantly looked around. 
0:13:27|0:13:30|Suddenly, the door of the small room was opened by him.
0:13:30|0:13:35|He entered the room and walked slowly towards the inside of the room.
0:13:35|0:13:38|As he aimed the gun at the room.
0:14:10|0:14:15|Upon entering the restroom, [Hong Zichen] leaned against the wall and let out a sigh, trying hard to calm down.
0:14:15|0:14:23|At this moment, he suddenly pulled out a gun, checked the magazine, loaded the gun, held it with both hands, and slowly walked towards the window.
0:14:23|0:14:30|Later, he looked out the window and saw [Che Linlin] pacing back and forth downstairs. [Hong Zichen] raised his gun and aimed at the ground below.
0:15:0|0:15:4|[Hong Zichen] peeked through the crack in the door at the soldiers outside and the animation of [Lu Xiao].
0:15:4|0:15:6|Then, she pushed open the door to the restroom.
0:15:49|0:16:6|In the hospital, nurses and doctors were in chaos. [Hong Zichen] and [Lu Xiao] quickly climbed the steps of the hospital and hurried to the second-floor ward. They then walked through a narrow and long corridor with walls half-covered in redwood. Finally, the two arrived at the door of the ward.
0:16:17|0:16:22|[Hong Zichen] hurriedly covered his face and burst into tears, while the crowd in front of the door looked at him in shock.
0:16:24|0:16:27|Finally, [Hong Zichen] and [Che Linlin] walked into the ward together.
0:16:27|0:16:31|[Hong Zichen] covered his face, observing the White Special Envoy lying on the hospital bed.
0:16:31|0:16:35|At this moment, Hong Zichen was wrapped in bandages from head to toe.
0:16:35|0:16:38|He had an oxygen tube inserted, his eyes staring straight at the ceiling.
0:16:38|0:16:46|Mo Han walked to the bedside, reaching for the gun at his waist, while also stealing a glance at the reaction of the person behind him.
0:16:46|0:16:50|He walked to the bedside, covered his body and looked at the special agent who was on the verge of death.
0:17:49|0:17:54|[Che Linlin] and [Lu Xiao] left the ward, Mo Han watched them leave and then turned around.
0:18:1|0:18:5|Hong Zichen slowly approached the edge of the bed, his eyes becoming even more cold and fierce.
0:18:5|0:18:17|The special agent on the bed tried desperately to speak, but only saw Mo Han getting closer and closer.
0:18:17|0:18:22|The doctor and nurse rushed in first, followed closely by [Che Linlin] and [Lu Xiao].
0:18:22|0:18:24|They gathered anxiously around the sickbed.
0:18:47|0:18:51|Mo Han knelt down in front of Che Zhenshan, the scene shifted, a soldier ran towards the Legion Building.
0:19:36|0:19:38|Speak up, [Lu Xiao] led the soldiers and charged out.
0:19:38|0:19:43|Mo Han turned around to look at them, stayed in place for a moment, and then walked towards the building.
0:19:43|0:19:47|Soldiers drove out of the legion gate in cars, heading towards the distance in a grand manner.
0:19:47|0:19:50|At this moment, Mo Han was making a phone call, feeling anxious and restless.
0:19:59|0:20:5|Following that, [Hong Zichen] rode a military motorcycle, speeding along the roads of Yangcheng.
0:20:5|0:20:10|The road winds and twists, surrounded by dense forests and barren grasslands.
0:20:10|0:20:19|In the distance, [Lu Xiao] and the soldiers are galloping towards them, [Mu Han] sees this and follows suit.
0:20:19|0:20:22|Later, [Mu Han] blocked the way of [Lu Xiao] and others.
0:20:51|0:20:57|Lu Xiao got off the car and grabbed Mo Han's arm, a gold bar fell to the ground, and they stopped pulling each other.
0:21:13|0:21:16|As soon as the words fell, [Lu Xiao] pointed the gun at Mo Han.
0:21:16|0:21:21|Shortly after, a small car drove up from behind and stopped next to them.
0:21:21|0:21:26|A man got out of the passenger seat, and to their surprise, it was [Che Linlin].
0:21:30|0:21:32|Che Linlin slapped Lu Xiao in the face.
0:21:35|0:21:37|[Lu Xiao] is at a loss after being beaten.
0:21:42|0:21:48|Che Linlin turned around and walked towards the depths of the forest, with Mo Han closely following him, both of them walking cautiously.
0:21:51|0:21:53|The surrounding weeds are about half a person's height.
0:22:7|0:22:12|At this moment, a group of bandits with guns suddenly emerged from the bushes, their faces covered.
0:22:15|0:22:22|Che Linlin, upon seeing the situation, quickly put down the gun with Mo Han, slowly squatted down, and threw the gun on the ground.
0:22:42|0:22:46|The bandit then turned around and walked into the woods behind with two of his henchmen.
0:22:46|0:22:48|[Che Linlin] and [Mo Han] stood still, staring at them.
0:22:51|0:22:54|In the distance, the bandits are holding Lingling hostage.
0:22:54|0:22:57|Lingling is tied up and gagged with a list in her mouth.
0:22:58|0:23:5|Mo Han turned back to look at Che Zhenshan, nodded, and walked up the hill with the wrapped gold in hand.
0:23:6|0:23:9|The bandits pointed their guns at him, and he threw the gold out.
0:23:14|0:23:16|At this moment, the bandits took Lingling out.
0:23:16|0:23:20|Lingling kept struggling and shaking, being pushed by the bandits.
0:23:20|0:23:23|[Lu Xiao] borrowed Zhuang and walked towards Lingling with his hands raised.
0:23:23|0:23:25|The bandits stared at her intently with their eyes.
0:23:25|0:23:30|He then walked up to Linlin and yanked the cloth out of her mouth.
0:23:33|0:23:43|Immediately, [Hong Zichen] took Lingling from the bandits and held her in his arms, ready to leave. A bandit aimed a gun at them.
0:23:43|0:23:49|Suddenly, [Lu Xiao] fired several shots from a distance, and the bandits immediately engaged in a fierce gunfight with [Lu Xiao].
0:23:49|0:23:55|Mo Han and Ling Ling quickly sat up, and [Che Linlin] also squatted down nearby.
0:23:55|0:23:58|A bandit threw a hand grenade, and in an instant, sparks flew in the bushes.
0:24:0|0:24:6|The bandits were forced to retreat repeatedly, and just as the bandit leader was about to retreat, he suddenly fell to the ground.
0:24:6|0:24:10|He slowly got up and, as he lifted his head, caught sight of Mo Han fleeing with scattered pieces.
0:24:16|0:24:22|[Lu Xiao] shot down the leader of the bandits with one shot, while Mo Han fell heavily to the ground at the same time.
0:24:22|0:24:32|Her eyes were lifeless, staring at the sky, feeling as if her body was unusually heavy as if she had been tagged, while the bandits in the distance were still fighting with the soldiers.
0:24:32|0:24:39|The scene shifts, Hong Zichen lies quietly on a bed, trying to open her mouth to speak but unable to muster any strength.
0:24:39|0:24:40|Shortly after, [Che Linlin] rushed over.
0:24:44|0:24:48|Ling Ling gazed at Mo Han's weak face, squatting down and leaning over the edge of the bed.
0:25:21|0:25:24|At this moment, [Che Linlin] welled up with tears.
0:25:48|0:25:51|[Lu Xiao] turned away with tears in the corners of his eyes.
0:25:52|0:25:54|Che Linlin called out to him as he sat down.
0:26:5|0:26:6|[Lu Xiao] frowned as he listened.
0:26:37|0:26:41|[Che Linlin] stopped and stood up after a moment of contemplation.
0:26:52|0:26:56|[Che Linlin] walked up behind [Lu Xiao], put on a military cap, and walked towards the door.
0:26:56|0:27:0|[Lu Xiao] stood still, his gaze becoming increasingly fierce.
0:27:0|0:27:4|In the hospital, Lingling sits by the bed feeding congee to the severely injured Mo Han.
0:27:4|0:27:7|Mo Han couldn't move, he could only slightly open his mouth and drink the porridge.
0:27:8|0:27:9|Mo Han begins to reminisce.
0:27:15|0:27:18|He leaned towards Yu Xuan's face.
0:27:18|0:27:21|Yu Xuan pushed him away and looked at his face.
0:27:21|0:27:23|He was a bit weak and could only nod slightly with pursed lips. 
0:27:27|0:27:32|She looked at Lu Xiao's eyes, which were like flowing water, with reluctance before turning away.
0:27:33|0:27:36|She stood still, and Yuxuan quickly came up and hugged her from behind.
0:27:36|0:27:40|In this era of war and turmoil, farewell means farewell forever.
0:27:40|0:27:46|Even though the two of them are deeply in love at this moment, shedding tears like rain, they are unable to resist the arrangement of fate.
0:27:47|0:27:52|Mo Han opened his eyes, at this moment, [Che Linlin] was wiping her cheeks with a towel, she shook her head.
0:27:58|0:28:0|Lingling's eye sockets were wet with tears.
0:28:7|0:28:10|Mo Hanyu weakly squeezed out a faint smile.
0:28:34|0:28:41|[Che Linlin] wiped away the tears on her face after hearing this, then picked up the porridge by the bedside and fed it to Mo Han.
0:28:41|0:28:47|In an instant, [Lu Xiao] pushed the door open and stood still in astonishment at the scene before him.
0:28:53|0:28:55|[Lu Xiao] looks down at Mo Han with a cold gaze.
0:28:55|0:28:56|[Lu Xiao] retracts his hands.
0:29:30|0:29:35|[Lu Xiao] discreetly points at Lingling with his hand, then shows a hesitant expression before turning away.
0:29:46|0:29:49|Lingling held a bowl and turned away from the bed, facing away from them.
0:29:49|0:29:52|At this moment, [Che Linlin] sat beside Mo Han with a smile.
0:30:8|0:30:10|The scene changes.
0:30:27|0:30:30|Che Linlin and Lu Xiao stared at each other solemnly.
0:30:50|0:30:56|[Che Linlin] looked up, his hands supporting his chin in contemplation.
0:31:0|0:31:8|On the other side, Linlin was in her room, looking through a stack of documents at the table, while Mohan lay on the small bed behind her.
0:31:10|0:31:15|Mo Han looked at the back of [Che Linlin], her bed placed side by side with [Che Linlin]'s bed.
0:31:25|0:31:30|[Che Linlin] sat at the table without turning around, instead writing something sparsely.
0:31:30|0:31:36|Mo Han saw the situation and wanted to get up in a hurry, but the pain was so intense that he couldn't move. He could only lift his head and lie down in pain.
0:31:41|0:31:46|[Che Linlin] immediately stopped the pen in her hand, lifted the blanket covering Mo Han, and slowly helped him up.
0:31:51|0:31:54|But when Mo Han sat up, [Che Linlin] squatted down again to help her put on her shoes.
0:31:54|0:31:58|At this moment, Mo Han's eyes were fixed on the table beside him.
0:31:58|0:32:2|Shortly after, [Che Linlin] helped her up and they walked towards the restroom.
0:32:2|0:32:9|Just as he reached the table, Mo Han looked at the documents on the table, a gun suddenly fell and landed beside the table. [Che Linlin] quickly rushed to support her.
0:32:16|0:32:19|Shortly after, [Che Linlin] supported Mo Han as they walked towards the restroom.
0:32:19|0:32:24|Mo Han walked away, but his eyes were still fixed on the desktop, and he didn't forget to look back again.
0:32:24|0:32:26|[Che Linlin] helped Mo Han into the restroom.
0:32:34|0:32:35|The soldier walked towards the table with a bowl of porridge.
0:32:36|0:32:40|I'll do it. Then, she knocked over the porridge onto the table.
0:32:47|0:32:50|Next, [Che Linlin] quickly used her hands to clean up the spilled porridge.
0:32:50|0:32:55|As she anxiously ran towards the restroom, Mo Han suddenly came out from inside.
0:32:55|0:32:58|Mo Han looked at the document and then turned around.
0:32:58|0:33:3|In front of the legion gate, Mo Han walked out from the courtyard and greeted the soldiers at the entrance.
0:33:3|0:33:8|At this moment, [Lu Xiao] is observing their every move from a distance with binoculars.
0:33:8|0:33:14|Shortly after, she put down the telescope.
0:33:29|0:33:31|At this moment, Mo Han was also making a phone call.
0:33:36|0:33:37|People kept passing by constantly around them.
0:33:48|0:33:53|When he hung up the phone and looked towards the door, a man suddenly hid himself.
0:33:53|0:33:59|He pondered for a moment, then walked towards the door. As he walked, a porter pulling a yellow cart passed by him.
0:33:59|0:34:4|He stopped and looked back, there were only a few pedestrians on the street.
0:34:4|0:34:7|He turned his head, paused for a moment, and then continued walking forward.
0:34:7|0:34:13|In the next scene, amidst the flowers, [Lu Xiao] and [Che Linlin] sit side by side, surrounded by blossoms.
0:34:47|0:34:50|Lu Xiao then took over the heart-shaped pendant.
0:34:50|0:34:53|Che Linlin turned around, and Lu Xiao helped her put on the item from behind.
0:34:53|0:34:58|Che Linlin leans on Lu Xiao's shoulder after fixing her hair.
0:35:12|0:35:14|[Lu Xiao] facing [Che Linlin].
0:35:24|0:35:27|Mo Han lowered his head, at a loss.
0:35:57|0:36:3|Lingling smiled slightly and stood up, happily running towards the distance, leaving Mo Han sitting alone in place.
0:36:3|0:36:9|The scene shifts, Mo Han walks in plain clothes on the street, with someone secretly following behind.
0:36:9|0:36:17|Mo Han turned his head, and the figure immediately disappeared again. Mo Han paused for a moment, then ran off at a corner.
0:36:17|0:36:18|He crossed the street.
0:36:18|0:36:20|Running through a long alleyway.
0:36:20|0:36:23|The man then quickened his pace and caught up.
0:36:23|0:36:26|The camera zooms in, revealing that the figure is actually [Lu Xiao].
0:36:26|0:36:34|[Lu Xiao] looked into the dark alley where he couldn't see his own hand in front of his face, glanced around cautiously, and carefully moved forward.
0:36:34|0:36:38|His shadow kept stretching, a thin layer of sweat forming on his forehead. 
0:36:40|0:36:47|Suddenly, his right leg was tripped, [Lu Xiao] fell to the ground, and [Hong Zichen] grabbed his neck from behind.
0:36:47|0:36:53|[Hong Zichen] clenched his teeth, gently lifting his hands, leaving [Lu Xiao] unable to move under him.
0:36:53|0:36:59|[Hong Zichen] slowly released her hands and lowered her head to carefully examine the man beneath her.
0:36:59|0:37:4|[Lu Xiao] lay on the ground, turned his head to look at [Hong Zichen], while [Hong Zichen] stared at [Lu Xiao] in a daze.
0:37:8|0:37:15|After [Hong Zichen] stood up, [Lu Xiao] also got up, still holding a gun in his hand.
0:37:28|0:37:32|[Lu Xiao] holds a gun up to [Hong Zichen].
0:37:45|0:37:47|[Hong Zichen] blocked [Lu Xiao]'s gun.
0:38:1|0:38:3|[Lu Xiao] raised the gun again.
0:38:29|0:38:32|[Lu Xiao] gestured for [Hong Zichen] to leave with the gun in his hand.
0:38:32|0:38:34|[Hong Zichen] didn't hesitate at all and turned around to leave.
0:39:2|0:39:8|Hong Zichen and Che Linlin embraced each other joyfully, their faces beaming with tears of happiness.
0:39:13|0:39:19|At this moment, [Che Linlin] suddenly let go of her hands, put away the smile on her face, and looked at [Hong Zichen].
0:40:6|0:40:8|Hong Zichen frowned.
0:40:9|0:40:13|At this moment, [Che Linlin] wiped off the salt sculpture on her face.
0:40:22|0:40:25|Please see, tears once again wet Hong Zichen's eyes.
0:40:30|0:40:35|[Lu Xiao] turned his face to the side and then walked towards the side.
0:40:51|0:40:55|[Hong Zichen] turned around, staring blankly ahead.
0:40:55|0:41:4|[Che Linlin] stared at [Hong Zichen] from behind, as [Hong Zichen] reached into his pocket and took out a heart-shaped pendant. He then turned around to face [Che Linlin], his mouth trembling.
0:41:9|0:41:19|She had tears in the corners of her eyes, turned around and looked tenderly at [Che Linlin]'s face, then reached out her hands to put a necklace on [Che Linlin], who leaned forward in response.
0:41:32|0:41:35|Tears also washed [Che Linlin]'s eyes.
0:41:50|0:41:52|Yuxuan couldn't bear to stare at [Mo Han].
0:41:57|0:42:8|[Lu Xiao] turned and left. At that moment, Yuxuan stepped forward and pulled out a strand of hair from the back of [Lu Xiao]'s head. The tears in her eyes sparkled like the stars in the sea, and her trembling lips looked particularly desolate.
0:42:10|0:42:13|[Mo Han] gritted his teeth, turned his back on Yuxuan, and watched her leave in the rain.
0:42:13|0:42:21|Liu Yuxuan looked at her back alone, her hand holding her hair still slightly shaking, but Yuxuan's heart was already full of scars.
0:42:21|0:42:29|At this moment, [Mo Han] walked out of the room in a daze, taking each step as if her feet were filled with lead, making it difficult for her to walk steadily.
0:42:29|0:42:33|She walked around the corner, lifted her eyes and saw [Che Linlin] standing right in front of her.
0:42:34|0:42:39|At this moment, [Che Linlin] is burning with anger, still wearing the same heart-shaped necklace around her neck.
0:43:3|0:43:4|Ling Ling tore off the necklace and threw it towards [Mo Han].
0:43:23|0:43:27|[Lu Xiao] went forward to chase, but was hit on the wound by [Che Linlin].
0:43:27|0:43:29|She bent over in pain, covering the wound.
0:43:29|0:43:34|[Che Linlin] turned around and, holding her face in her hands, started crying uncontrollably.
0:43:51|0:43:57|Mo Han hugged [Che Linlin], letting her pound on his injured chest.
0:44:9|0:44:12|Mo Han pulled [Che Linlin] and looked back at her.
0:44:12|0:44:17|[Che Linlin] stood still, bowing her head and panting, like a child who had made a mistake in a hurry.
0:44:17|0:44:22|Mo Han walked up and put the heart-shaped necklace back around her neck.
0:44:22|0:44:31|[Che Linlin] looked up and gazed at the man in front of her. Seeing the wounds on his chest that she had never noticed before, she felt a pang of sadness, and tears welled up in her eyes.
0:44:32|0:44:38|Later, Mo Han held [Che Linlin]'s hand and walked towards room 305. The two pushed open the door and walked into the room.
0:44:38|0:44:43|The room was dimly lit, with [Che Linlin] walking ahead and Mo Han following behind.
0:44:47|0:44:56|Mo Han looked carefully and saw that the window behind the curtain was wide open. She quickly stepped forward to pull the curtain tight, then faced [Che Linlin] with her hands hidden behind her back.
0:44:56|0:44:59|Seeing [Che Linlin] without noticing, [Hong Zichen] breathed a sigh of relief.
0:45:0|0:45:1|Lingling faces [Mo Han].
0:45:25|0:45:32|If Lu Xiao knew I was smoking, [Che Linlin] frowned suspiciously at [Mo Han], with a hint of worry in her eyes.
0:45:34|0:45:36|[Che Linlin] lowered her eyes.
0:45:40|0:45:44|She then looked up at [Mo Han] and turned away.
0:45:44|0:45:48|[Lu Xiao] glanced at the curtains behind him and then walked away with large strides.
0:46:54|0:46:58|The scene shifts to a room where [Hong Zichen] is unbuttoning his shirt and drinking alone.
0:46:58|0:47:1|He put down his glass and looked across.
0:47:7|0:47:10|[Che Linlin] sat across, stunned.
0:47:11|0:47:26|It's just that being suspicious, [Mo Han] poured himself another glass of wine, then drank it all in one gulp. [Che Linlin] leaned back in the chair, staring blankly at the ceiling, with both hands hanging on the armrests of the chair.
0:47:39|0:47:41|[Lu Xiao] shook his head.
0:47:55|0:47:58|Lingling stared straight at herself in the mirror.
0:48:47|0:48:49|[Lu Xiao] lifted his leg and knocked Mo Han to the ground.
0:48:51|0:48:56|[Lu Xiao] and a group of people beat up Mo Han, who writhes in pain on the ground.
0:48:56|0:48:58|Suddenly, Lingling stood up and pulled out a handgun.
0:49:0|0:49:4|Lingling pointed a gun at [Lu Xiao], and everyone stopped beating Mo Han.
0:49:27|0:49:32|Shortly after, [Lu Xiao] led the soldiers out of the room, while Lingling still pointed her gun at them.
0:49:32|0:49:36|Mo Han was curled up on the ground after being beaten, Lingling collapsed on the ground.
0:49:36|0:49:42|Outside the window, a full moon hangs in the sky, tears streaming down Lingling's face inside the room.
0:49:47|0:49:52|The scene shifts, Mo Han turned over in bed and ended up hugging Lingling lying beside him.
0:49:53|0:49:57|He woke up suddenly from his dream, sat up in bed and looked at Linlin.
0:49:57|0:50:7|Linlin held his hand tightly as she slept, he gently withdrew his hand, sat on the bed for a moment in contemplation, then turned around and sat on the edge of the bed, fiddling with his hands and feet to put on his shoes.
0:50:7|0:50:16|He looked towards the cabinet and sofa on the side, got up quietly and walked towards the cabinet, fumbled for a moment, then turned towards the sofa where a book was wrapped in clothes.
0:50:17|0:50:22|He slowly unbuttoned his shirt, took out the book inside, and at the same time, he didn't forget to turn his head and look at the sleeping [Che Linlin].
0:50:22|0:50:25|Next, Mo Han took a book and hid in the restroom.
0:50:25|0:50:31|He immediately turned on the light in the bathroom, sat on the toilet, and flipped through the contents of the book.
0:50:36|0:50:41|He quickly flipped through the contents of the book, his panicked eyes filled with unease.
0:50:41|0:50:47|The densely packed words in the book occupied his entire field of vision, and his eyes could no longer leave the pages.
0:50:47|0:50:51|His hands trembled slightly as he held the book, the words dancing in his eyes.
0:50:53|0:51:0|He sat silently on the toilet, flipping through the book in his hand without stopping, letting time pass by bit by bit.
0:51:0|0:51:5|He then returned to the bedroom and searched through the cabinets and drawers by the bed for clues.
0:51:5|0:51:10|At this moment, the sleeping [Che Linlin] woke up and opened her eyes to look at [Hong Zichen].
0:51:11|0:51:13|[Hong Zichen] looked up in panic.
0:51:25|0:51:31|After speaking, [Che Linlin] turned her head and went to sleep, while [Hong Zichen] turned around and left.
0:51:31|0:51:37|In the next scene, inside the post office, [Hong Zichen] picks up the phone and waits for a call.
0:51:37|0:51:44|[Hong Zichen] lowered his head, smoking, standing in front of the phone. Outside, there was a bustling scene of cars and horses, while inside the post office, various packages were piled up together.
0:51:44|0:51:50|Afterwards, she turned the dial again, but there was still no answer on the other end of the line.
0:51:51|0:52:0|He furrowed his brows in confusion, the sunlight casting a slight wrinkle at the corner of his eyes, his features appearing more rugged and upright against the backdrop of shadows.
0:52:0|0:52:9|[Hong Zichen] held the earpiece in his left hand, his jaw slightly retracted, a hint of imperceptible fear flashing in his eyes. He then hung up the phone and strode quickly towards the door.
0:52:11|0:52:18|Hong Zichen then arrived at a store through a small path, where a sign at the entrance read "closed due to poor management."
0:52:18|0:52:24|The picture gradually blurs at this moment, revealing a contact a week later, with Fengling Road being the location of the big pharmacy.
0:52:24|0:52:30|Mo Han immediately ran towards the nearby window, pressed against it to look inside, then turned around and walked towards the door.
0:52:30|0:52:36|As he furrowed his brow in thought, he looked up and saw a shifty-looking man rushing towards him.
0:52:37|0:52:42|The scene begins with a flashback, showing Mo Hanchu first meeting the man who was tied up.
0:52:44|0:52:48|The scene cuts back to reality, with the man staring at Mo Han.
0:53:2|0:53:4|Mo Han ran away, with a man chasing after him.
0:54:15|0:54:25|As soon as the words fell, Hong Zichen kept turning his small eyes, thinking. Then a smirk appeared on his lips, and he voluntarily put away the gun in his hand.
0:54:26|0:54:33|Both sides put away their guns, then Mo Han took out a stack of banknotes and handed it to the man, who took the money.
0:54:52|0:54:56|The man turned around with the money, and Mo Han immediately pulled out a gun, pointing it at him.
0:54:56|0:54:59|Che Linlin is running towards here from not far away.
0:54:59|0:55:2|Mo Han saw it and immediately ran towards [Che Linlin].
0:55:23|0:55:25|Mo Han raised his hand awkwardly to bid farewell.
0:55:25|0:55:31|Lingling turned back in confusion and looked at the man with small eyes.
0:55:34|0:55:37|Mo Han looked up and saw a figure flash by upstairs.
0:55:40|0:55:48|From then on, Mo Han pulled Lingling out of the alley. As the camera zoomed in, the figure upstairs was Lu Xiao, who was watching the two of them leave.
0:55:48|0:55:51|In the room, [Lu Xiao] slams a gold bar on the table.
0:55:58|0:56:1|The man with small eyes was instantly stunned.
0:56:23|0:56:30|The scene shifts to [Che Linlin]'s office.
0:56:30|0:56:36|[Che Linlin] picked up the teacup and took a sip of tea.
0:56:36|0:56:37|After listening, he put down the cup.
0:56:46|0:56:50|[Lu Xiao] is going to stay in place.
0:56:59|0:57:0|[Lu Xiao] is about to turn around.
0:57:3|0:57:7|Shortly after, [Lu Xiao] left the office.
0:57:7|0:57:10|That night, Mo Han handed a gold bar to the man with small eyes.
0:57:11|0:57:14|The man with small eyes took the gold bar and looked around.
0:57:16|0:57:19|Mo Han turned his head to look around.
0:57:20|0:57:26|On the other side, [Che Linlin] lay on the bed, slowly reaching out her hands to the heart-shaped pendant on her chest.
0:57:26|0:57:29|She touched the pendant and began to recall what had happened during the day.
0:57:36|0:57:42|Ling Ling slowly opened her eyes, the chimpanzee pendant still on her lips.
0:57:42|0:57:49|She then put down the necklace, slowly placed her hand on her abdomen, her eyes becoming more determined.
0:57:49|0:57:52|The next day, Mo Han was standing on the bustling street.
0:57:52|0:57:56|She looked around cautiously, then suddenly saw a man with small eyes approaching from the opposite side.
0:57:56|0:57:58|He quickly found a corner to hide in.
0:58:0|0:58:7|On the other side, [Lu Xiao] was also wandering on the street. When he saw the man with small eyes, he immediately hid in the corner to observe.
0:58:7|0:58:14|The man with small eyes looked around, and when he saw [Lu Xiao] hiding, he walked towards his own back.
0:58:14|0:58:20|Pedestrians come and go on the street, while vendors on both sides of the street set up small stalls to do business.
0:58:20|0:58:24|The man with small eyes stood alone on the street, while [Lu Xiao] and Mo Han observed him from a corner.
0:58:29|0:58:34|The man with small eyes fell to the ground, and [Mo Han] in the corner widened his eyes when he saw it.
0:58:34|0:58:39|[Mo Han] looked into the distance, Lingling turned around and hurriedly walked into an alley.
0:58:39|0:58:47|At the same time, as Lingling put something into her bag, [Lu Xiao] was also shocked and stared at her with wide eyes after seeing her figure.
0:58:48|0:58:51|In the post office, [Mo Han] anxiously makes a phone call.
0:58:54|0:58:56|He furrowed his brow.
0:58:56|0:59:5|A distant cousin came over, and the scene shifted to a fabric store, where various patterned fabrics were displayed.
0:59:5|0:59:5|[Che Linlin] picked up a piece of exquisite silk.
0:59:27|0:59:33|[Che Linlin] put down the piece of fabric and looked at other silk fabrics.
0:59:33|0:59:37|Mo Han looked back at the clock, which showed three o'clock sharp.
0:59:37|0:59:40|She turned around and saw a man walking towards the store.
0:59:44|0:59:46|The man then looked at [Che Linlin].
1:0:11|1:0:15|[Che Linlin] impatiently looked at the man, then left with Mo Han.
1:0:15|1:0:18|The man stood still, his eyes fixed on them.
1:0:18|1:0:21|[Che Linlin] and Mo Han walked out of the store and onto the bustling street.
1:0:21|1:0:24|The man walked out of the store and watched the direction they left. 
1:0:24|1:0:30|He then walked over to the assistant setting up a stall in front of the store, his eyes constantly looking towards the two figures walking away.
1:0:30|1:0:36|At this moment, [Mo Han] turned to look at the man, who suddenly took a big step and disappeared from the frame.
1:0:40|1:0:43|[Mo Han] turned around and took Lingling to a street-side stall.
1:0:43|1:0:49|[Mo Han] sneaked a glance back and saw the man hiding in the corner, engaging in a war of words with [Lu Xiao] who was holding a newspaper beside him.
1:0:49|1:0:51|[Mo Han] then turned around.
1:1:19|1:1:22|After [Lu Xiao] left, [Che Linlin] angrily stayed in place.
1:1:22|1:1:29|He then picked up the phone on the table, dialed a number, and waited for the call to be answered.
1:1:36|1:1:39|[Mo Han] and Yu Xuan are having a meeting.
1:1:39|1:1:42|Yuxuan turned around and ran towards the cabinet behind her, searching for something.
1:1:42|1:1:45|Mo Han stood still, waiting.
1:1:45|1:1:48|Yu Xuan opened the drawer and took out two thick books.
1:1:48|1:1:56|She then brought the book in front of Mo Han to show him.
1:1:56|1:2:0|In Che Linlin's office, [Lu Xiao] walked in and took off his hat.
1:3:46|1:3:52|Shortly after, [Lu Xiao] stormed out angrily.
1:3:54|1:3:57|Ling Ling stood still in place.
1:4:10|1:4:15|The scene shifts, and Hong Zichen stands in front of everyone at the station, looking at them solemnly.
1:4:45|1:4:48|Che Linlin nodded and then looked at Mo Han.
1:4:56|1:5:4|At the entrance of the pharmacy, Mo Han looked around before walking in. [Lu Xiao] secretly hid behind the wall, following Mo Han and keeping his eyes on him.
1:5:4|1:5:7|A yellow taxi passed by, and [Lu Xiao] hid.
1:5:7|1:5:18|Shortly after, [Mo Han] walked out of the pharmacy, looked around, and still held two packets of medicinal herbs in his hands.
1:5:18|1:5:25|Following that, [Hong Zichen] left the pharmacy, [Lu Xiao] peeked out from the wall to watch [Hong Zichen]'s back, standing in place with a furrowed brow.
1:5:29|1:5:31|[Che Linlin] coldly raised her head.
1:6:7|1:6:10|[Lu Xiao] strolled leisurely ahead.
1:6:13|1:6:15|[Mo Han] anxiously followed behind him.
1:6:15|1:6:18|[Lu Xiao] turned around and smiled before striding away.
1:7:14|1:7:17|Che Linlin glanced up at Hong Zichen.
1:7:22|1:7:25|[Lu Xiao] then showed a relieved smile.
1:7:53|1:8:1|[Mo Han] stood up, then sat back down in despair, his expression becoming even more solemn.
1:8:1|1:8:6|In the army, soldiers are running quickly with guns on their backs, then standing in neat rows.
1:8:6|1:8:10|[Lu Xiao] adjusted his collar, stood at the front of the line, ready to set off.
1:8:10|1:8:15|In the office, [Hong Zichen] turned his back and secretly wrote something on a piece of paper.
1:8:19|1:8:27|Che Linlin was half lying on the soft leather sofa, with her hands crossed in front of her chest, eyes closed and a slight smile on her face.
1:8:27|1:8:35|Muhan then put away the note in his hand and looked at Che Linlin, who was already fast asleep on the sofa.
1:8:45|1:8:47|[Mo Han] then stood up.
1:8:47|1:8:51|At this moment, [Che Linlin] secretly opened one eye and watched [Mo Han]'s back.
1:8:51|1:8:54|At this moment, the soldiers are ready to go.
1:8:54|1:8:59|A convoy of military vehicles filled with people neatly drove out of the gate of the Nationalist Army Corps.
1:8:59|1:9:2|At the same time, [Hong Zichen] arrived at the office.
1:9:24|1:9:26|[Lu Xiao] hurriedly chased after.
1:9:28|1:9:37|Che [Zhen Shan] stood up from the sofa, quickly walked to the door, and opened it slightly to look outside.
1:9:37|1:9:40|Outside, Mo Han handed a note to [Che Linlin].
1:9:40|1:9:44|Che [Zhen Shan] turned around, furrowing her brows, then sat back on the sofa.
1:9:48|1:9:51|Lingling took the note from Mo Han and ran away with a smile.
1:9:51|1:9:56|Che [Zhen Shan] at this moment, slowly picks up the water glass while furrowing her brows in contemplation.
1:9:56|1:10:0|She absentmindedly sips her tea, her eyes occasionally glancing towards the door. 
1:10:0|1:10:2|Later, Mo Han pushed the door open and walked in.
1:10:15|1:10:18|Che [Zhen Shan] puts down the cup.
1:10:18|1:10:34|Next, Che [Zhen Shan] leaned back on the sofa, hugging his arms and fell asleep. Mo Han looked at him, then unbuttoned his shirt, half lying on the sofa, every breath revealing worry, looking up at the ceiling.
1:10:34|1:10:39|The clock pointed to twelve o'clock, Che [Zhen Shan] was awakened by the bell.
1:10:39|1:10:47|[Che Linlin] rubbed her eyes, and at this moment, [Lu Xiao] ran over and caught a female communist party member on the subway.
1:11:21|1:11:25|[Che Linlin] picked up the hat and walked away quickly, Mo Han followed suit.
1:11:25|1:11:29|Soon after, Hong Zichen, Che Linlin, and Lu Xiao arrived at the dark prison.
1:11:29|1:11:35|The prison walls were covered with iron chains. Several people walked through the delicate corridor and arrived in front of the prisoners.
1:11:35|1:11:41|[Che Linlin] and [Lu Xiao] faced the criminal, and then Mo Han walked over to take a closer look, only to find out that the captured criminal was Yuxuan.
1:12:16|1:12:21|Mo Han took the whip tremblingly, his outstretched hand shaking slightly.
1:12:21|1:12:24|Shortly after, [Che Linlin] and [Lu Xiao] turned around and left.
1:12:24|1:12:27|Mo Han stood holding a whip, watching them leave blankly.
1:12:27|1:12:35|Hong Zichen suddenly turned around, facing the bound Yu Xuan.
1:12:35|1:12:38|Yuxuan shook her head, indicating her to look up, where a bug was hidden.
1:12:40|1:12:46|At this moment, [Che Linlin] is sitting in the monitoring room, while [Mo Han] is tapping his fingers and communicating with [Yu Xuan].
1:13:0|1:13:3|They were communicating by tapping their fingers to send Morse code messages.
1:13:5|1:13:8|Yu Xuan and Mu Han locked eyes.
1:13:8|1:13:11|In the monitoring room, [Che Linlin] suddenly takes off her headphones.
1:13:16|1:13:25|Che Linlin stops Lu Xiao from leaving, and the listener immediately readjusts the listening device. Che Linlin puts her headphones back on, while Lu Xiao stands aside.
1:14:4|1:14:9|[Hong Zichen] anxiously signaled to [Lu Xiao], but [Lu Xiao] stood still, always staring at [Hong Zichen].
1:14:9|1:14:14|Outside, lightning flashed and thunder roared, illuminating [Mo Han]'s face.
1:14:14|1:14:19|[Mo Han] looked up at the overhead monitor, then turned to gaze at [Yu Xuan].
1:14:19|1:14:23|The light in [Mo Han]'s eyes gradually fades away as she stares blankly at [Yu Xuan].
1:14:23|1:14:30|At this moment, [Hong Zichen] was shouting with her mouth wide open, but [Lu Xiao] looked absent-minded, unable to hear [Hong Zichen]'s voice.
1:14:33|1:14:42|A bolt of lightning tore through the night sky, [Hong Zichen] picked up the whip blankly, repeatedly, like a heartless machine, crazily lashing at [Che Linlin].
1:14:42|1:14:53|The whip left long marks on [Yu Xuan]'s body, but [Mo Han] remained motionless like a corpse, mechanically repeating the actions, tears sliding down her rough skin.
1:14:53|1:14:55|[Yuxuan] closed her eyes tightly and clenched her fists.
1:14:58|1:15:1|In the monitoring room, [Che Linlin] listened carefully.
1:15:1|1:15:4|Outside, the wind and rain were raging, [Che Linlin] pushed the door open.
1:15:6|1:15:12|In the monitoring room, [Che Linlin] tightened her headphones, and [Mo Han]'s whip was snatched away by [Che Linlin].
1:15:18|1:15:23|[Che Linlin] fiercely whipped [Mo Han] with a whip, then pushed [Mo Han] to the ground.
1:15:33|1:15:42|[Che Linlin] cracked the whip on the ground, looking at [Lu Xiao] covered in bloodstains, then suddenly shifted her gaze to the heart-shaped agate necklace around her neck.
1:15:42|1:15:50|She walked over, touched [Yu Xuan]'s necklace, and then took the necklace off [Yu Xuan]'s neck.
1:15:50|1:15:56|She held the necklace in her hand, examined it carefully, and then took out her own necklace from around her neck to take a look.
1:15:59|1:16:15|At this moment, [Lu Xiao] suddenly pushed the door open. He looked at Lingling wearing a necklace that matched the one on her hand, then glanced at the unconscious Yuxuan. He narrowed his eyes, a faint, sinister smile playing on his lips, as lightning reflected on his face, giving him an eerie appearance.
1:16:15|1:16:22|By the pond, Lingling fought side by side with Mo Han in a new cheongsam, while Mo Han slumped down in disappointment.
1:16:22|1:16:28|The surface of the pond reflected the figures of Hong Zichen and Che Linlin, with tears in her eyes, Linlin took out a necklace from her pocket.
1:16:33|1:16:35|Hong Zichen looked up in confusion.
1:16:45|1:16:50|Later, [Che Linlin] put the necklace back into her pocket, and the two of them strolled along a small path.
1:17:35|1:17:43|Taking a deep breath, [Hong Zichen] pulled out a necklace from his neck, then turned around holding the necklace and looked at [Mo Han].
1:17:53|1:17:57|Lingling turned around again, with her back facing Mo Han.
1:18:30|1:18:32|Mo Han embraced Lingling in his arms.
1:18:32|1:18:36|Lingling is heartbroken and vents her sorrow.
1:18:43|1:18:47|Lingling pushed away his embrace.
1:19:14|1:19:19|Che Linlin quickly wiped away the tears on her face, turning her back to Mo Han and the soldiers.
1:19:24|1:19:26|[Che Linlin] nodded.
1:19:28|1:19:34|After that, Hong Zichen turned around and walked away. The wind at night messed up her hair and also disturbed her thoughts.
1:19:34|1:19:42|She took out the necklace from her pocket, then looked at it and held it in her palm, covering her face and burst into tears.
1:19:42|1:19:50|Che Linlin's body couldn't help but tremble, tears wet her eye sockets, and also soaked her shoulder.
1:19:50|1:19:54|Mo Han pushed open the door and entered the office, and [Che Linlin] immediately put away what she was holding.
1:20:59|1:21:2|Che Linlin turns around.
1:21:16|1:21:22|At this moment, [Lu Xiao] was eavesdropping outside the window, squinting his eyes with a sly smile, then he turned around and walked away confidently.
1:21:59|1:22:1|Che Linlin turns around.
1:22:26|1:22:31|Che Linlin turned around and went to answer the phone.
1:22:46|1:22:50|Lingling stood still as [Che Linlin] hung up the phone and walked up to her.
1:22:50|1:22:55|She stopped, hesitated for a moment, and then quickly left Lingling's room.
1:22:55|1:23:1|Suddenly, her door was kicked open, and Lingling pointed a gun at the person outside, who turned out to be [Hong Zichen] disguised as a woman.
1:23:14|1:23:17|[Hong Zichen] puts the wig and gun on the table, then takes off the women's clothing.
1:23:25|1:23:28|Lingling cried and threw herself into [Hong Zichen]'s arms.
1:23:57|1:24:1|Lingling frowned, [Hong Zichen] turned to look at him.
1:24:44|1:24:48|Hong Zichen picked up the gun and walked out of Lingling's room.
1:24:48|1:24:54|[Hong Zichen] came to the safe in the Legion building, secretly shining a flashlight and turning the combination lock on the safe.
1:24:54|1:24:59|She turned the rusty lock while looking back attentively.
1:24:59|1:25:5|While she was completely focused on picking the lock, suddenly, the lights in the room were turned on.
1:25:5|1:25:9|She turned around instantly, pointing a gun at the other person, but the person behind her was [Che Linlin].
1:25:15|1:25:17|Che Linlin points the gun at him.
1:25:21|1:25:24|[Che Linlin] had tears in her eyes, the gun still held in her hand.
1:25:24|1:25:27|Mo Han walked to the table and placed the gun on it.
1:25:27|1:25:30|Che Linlin put down the gun, and Mo Han nodded.
1:25:50|1:25:59|Are you not afraid of exposing yourself? In the end, [Che Linlin] raised the gun again, aiming at Mo Han's head.
1:26:20|1:26:23|Mo Han slowly approached [Che Linlin].
1:27:11|1:27:13|[Hong Zichen] lowered his eyes.
1:27:15|1:27:17|Mo Han frowned and stared at her.
1:27:19|1:27:23|As soon as the words fell, Mo Han immediately turned and walked towards the safe.
1:27:23|1:27:24|Mo Han quickly spins the combination lock.
1:27:27|1:27:29|Che Linlin lowered her head to contemplate the evidence.
1:27:35|1:27:38|She then looked at [Che Linlin] and shook her head.
1:27:38|1:27:40|After some contemplation, [Che Linlin] looked at Mo Han.
1:27:44|1:27:48|After speaking, [Che Linlin] locked her eyes tightly on the safe in front of her.
1:27:48|1:27:50|Hong Zichen's fingers were spinning on top.
1:27:50|1:27:53|[Che Linlin] held her breath, her eyes unusually determined.
1:27:53|1:27:56|The safe door was then opened.
1:27:56|1:27:59|[Hong Zichen] happily turned around to look at [Che Linlin].
1:27:59|1:28:3|At this moment, [Che Linlin], with tears in her eyes, couldn't help but sob.
1:28:14|1:28:23|Mu Han embraced [Che Linlin] and she turned to open the safe, only to find it empty. Suddenly, [Hong Zichen] appeared with a gun.
1:28:26|1:28:27|The two stood still in place.
1:28:57|1:29:0|[Che Linlin] points a gun at her own head.
1:29:8|1:29:12|Mo Han took the gun that took the spirit's life, at this moment, [Lu Xiao] couldn't walk in with the gun.
1:29:39|1:29:43|Saying that, [Lu Xiao] raised the bomb in his other hand, while Ling Ling hid behind Che Linlin.
1:29:45|1:29:47|Both sides are holding their guns in position.
1:29:47|1:29:52|At this moment, [Che Linlin] slowly lowered the gun in her hand, crouched down, and placed the gun on the ground.
1:29:56|1:29:58|[Lu Xiao] points a gun at Mo Han.
1:30:15|1:30:17|[Lu Xiao] had a smug smile on his face.
1:30:21|1:30:24|Mo Han pushed Che Zhen Shan and Lin Li away.
1:30:27|1:30:30|He shot [Lu Xiao] in the abdomen, and [Lu Xiao] fell down.
1:30:33|1:30:35|Mo Han ran out of the building with Lin Li and her father.
1:30:44|1:30:46|Che Linlin looks at Lingling.
1:30:55|1:30:57|Father and daughter embrace each other.
1:31:53|1:31:57|Mo Han stood aside, turned his back to the two women, and secretly wiped away his tears.
1:31:57|1:32:0|At this moment, [Che Linlin] suddenly looked up and gazed at Linlin.
1:32:5|1:32:7|Che Linlin takes out the password book.
1:32:11|1:32:13|He then turned to look at Mo Han.
1:32:19|1:32:21|A tear fell from Hong Zichen's face.
1:32:53|1:32:59|Suddenly, [Lu Xiao] staggered out of the building, pointing a gun at Mo Han.
1:32:59|1:33:3|Ling Ling turned around and ran to stand in front of [Hong Zichen].
1:33:3|1:33:7|A bullet hit Lingling's chest.
1:33:7|1:33:10|Mo Han raised his gun and shot [Lu Xiao].
1:33:15|1:33:18|[Che Linlin] looked at [Lu Xiao], then angrily rushed towards [Lu Xiao].
1:33:20|1:33:23|[Lu Xiao] forcefully grabbed [Che Linlin]'s neck.
1:33:32|1:33:39|[Lu Xiao] holds the unconscious [Che Linlin], who still clutches the codebook in her hand, while [Lu Xiao] fights desperately.
1:33:39|1:33:45|After Lu Xiao and Che Linlin escaped, Lu Xiao grabbed Che Linlin by the neck, and Che Linlin instantly activated the bomb.
1:33:50|1:33:55|Mo Han turned around at the sound and saw a huge mushroom cloud rising not far away.
1:33:55|1:34:0|Hong Zichen quickly left with Linlin in his arms.
1:34:0|1:34:2|The scene shifts to inside the hospital.
1:34:2|1:34:5|Mo Han opened the door of the hospital and walked to the bedside.
1:34:5|1:34:8|She looked worriedly at [Lu Xiao] lying on the bed covered in injuries.
1:34:18|1:34:19|[Che Linlin] is lying on the other side of the ward.
1:34:52|1:34:54|[Yuxuan] also opened her eyes.
1:35:1|1:35:5|Mo Han released Lingling's hand in pain, then turned around.
1:35:13|1:35:16|Tears covered Mo Han's face.
1:35:26|1:35:35|[Lu Xiao] was crouched by [Che Linlin]'s bed, crying bitterly. Then [Che Linlin] weakly took out the heart-shaped necklace from around her neck.
1:35:54|1:35:58|In the end, [Che Linlin] closed her eyes and let go of the necklace in her hand.
1:36:30|1:36:40|The scene shifts, a pair of hands strike a match, igniting the Kuomintang army's codebook, the burning flames instantly engulfing the entire codebook.
1:36:40|1:36:55|At this moment, the screen shows text: After the 918 Incident, the Communist Party of China made long and unremitting efforts to establish a united front against Japan with the Kuomintang. [Hong Zichen] and Miao Yuxuan embarked on a new revolutionary journey.
