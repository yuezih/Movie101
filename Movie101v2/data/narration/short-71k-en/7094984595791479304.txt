0:2:20|0:2:26|The scene shifts to the Kaifeng arrest room at night, where the constables are gathered together gambling.
0:2:26|0:2:32|In the midst of a crowd, a muscular young man exerted all his strength to lift the huge rock beneath him.
0:2:32|0:2:38|Not far away, on the side of the dark poison, a shadowy old constable was smoking a cigarette, looking towards the young man.
0:2:40|0:2:50|This is the young man who just joined our capture team - [Dao Yichang].
0:2:50|0:3:0|For a moment at the Gong Mansion, [Dao Yichang] broke several huge stone locks and lifted the stones above his head.
0:3:0|0:3:5|Seeing this, [Zhuge Qingyun] the constable tapped the table with his pipe and said to the painter behind him.
0:3:37|0:4:0|Upon entering the tiger's den, he was able to establish a connection with the gambling boss and conspire to cheat for money. It seems that [Dao Yichang] is not to be underestimated. As the camera rises, the night in Kaifeng city is illuminated by dim lights. Above this faint light, the four words of "Qimen Dunjia" fall into the screen, followed by a blood-red color from the sky, immense and heading towards Kaifeng.
0:4:0|0:4:18|This object is extraordinary, surrounded by broken stones, with the essence of a crane in its body, not resembling gold or stone, but rather having a somewhat fleshy feel. It is enveloped in heavenly fire, smashing into the tomb, causing the mountain to be illuminated by the fire. Wherever it crashes, the surrounding area is flattened, and a shimmering demonic light can be seen on its body.
0:4:19|0:4:21|The looming mountain fire reflects the imminent threat.
0:4:21|0:4:26|The scene shifts, with [Dao Yichang] chatting with the shopkeeper in front of a pancake shop in the bustling market.
0:5:2|0:5:12|[Dao Yichang] looked at the tofu seller auntie and said.
0:5:12|0:5:17|In the midst of boredom, [Dao Yichang] happened to catch a glimpse and was immediately captivated by someone.
0:5:20|0:5:42|Behind him, a burly man with a single eye was carrying a huge fish tank and walking through the crowd to the fishing ground. He half-rewarded and half-took a wanted order placed in front of his eyes for comparison. The painter's casually drawn portrait was surprisingly similar to this man by seven points. He immediately followed the burly man to the most crowded table for miscellaneous tasks.
0:5:42|0:5:53|After he walked away, the half-mouthed aunt who had just been arrogant took out a compass from under her clothes. She fixed her eyes on it and saw that the direction the compass pointed to was exactly where the big man had gone.
0:5:53|0:5:56|Auntie saw the situation and chased after the direction indicated by the compass.
0:5:56|0:6:2|The scene shifts, and the big man walks into an inn, slamming the fish tank on the table and shouting.
0:7:2|0:7:20|The eyes followed, and then saw the small fish in the fish tank suddenly grow larger, turning into a strange fish with three eyes and sharp teeth in its mouth. It swallowed the big man in one bite.
0:7:20|0:7:28|Just then, [Dao Yichang] leaped down from the roof and slashed at the strange fish with his knife, but the creature, a cunning fox, flew long and dodged the attack by swinging its fish tail.
0:7:31|0:7:42|And so, the auntie finally made her move, closing her teeth tightly to form a hard seal, trapping the strange fish in front of the screen, and then pulling out a red cushion from her sleeve to seal off the surrounding wooden tables and households.
0:7:59|0:8:16|As soon as the words fell, the cage loosened, and the strange fish wriggled its body, breaking free from the restraints. It dropped its head towards [Da Shen], only to see [Da Shen] calmly raise her hand, open the mouth of the strange fish, and reach in. She pulled out the tongue of the strange fish, which was more than half a meter long, from its gaping mouth.
0:8:16|0:8:28|When the strange fish was distracted by pain, it was kicked by Auntie to the second floor of the inn. It then broke through the roof and fled outside, chasing after the monster that ran into the bustling market in a hurry.
0:8:31|0:8:53|In the inn, seeing the shopkeeper and the shop assistant startled, the old lady reached into her bosom and took out five pieces of firework paper talismans. The objects in her hand turned into moths and flew towards the faces of those around her. As they approached, the moths disappeared and turned into sparkling powder, merging into the eyes of the shopkeeper and others. Then the great deity took out a piece of flower cloth and displayed it in front of the screen.
0:8:53|0:9:11|Incorporating oneself into the fabric, moving with the wind, chasing after the strange fish, looking at the shopkeeper and others, the golden moth pounced, already forgetting everything, unaware of the previous danger, causing a commotion. The great master could not find the trace of the strange fish, so he emerged from the flower fabric, disguised as a Taoist, and used a compass to explore.
0:9:11|0:9:15|Guided by him, they arrived at San Sheng Pavilion in the scenic city of Kaifeng.
0:9:15|0:9:21|Pushing the door open, Zhuge Qingyun saw shadows moving behind the screen in the hall, so he immediately flew towards it.
0:9:21|0:9:26|In the dark corner, [Shen Suan Zi] is entangled in a fight with that figure, and starts to discuss philosophy.
0:9:32|0:9:47|The two chased each other for a long time, until they reached a brightly lit place inside the building and finally learned each other's identities. Then [Dao Yichang] spoke up.
0:9:47|0:9:51|The Marquis pressed his hand against the opponent's chest, feeling the wind fish, and quickly withdrew his stance.
0:10:3|0:10:19|As he spoke, [Dao Yichang] grabbed the beard under the Taoist's box and pulled it, causing the mask to loosen. Seeing this, the Taoist adjusted it himself, revealing a face as elegant as a falling rain and flying geese under the mask. [Dao Yichang] couldn't help but be stunned.
0:10:41|0:10:46|Muttering the word "Jiaojiao" under his breath, [Dao Yichang] rushed up to the top floor attic.
0:11:32|0:11:35|The beauty spoke, and with a light pull, she restrained the flirtatious woman out of the window.
0:11:51|0:11:54|Jiaojiao's face contorted and transformed into a man's appearance.
0:12:7|0:12:14|Upon hearing movement in the barrel in the room, the beauty stopped engaging with the two men and went to the side of the barrel to investigate.
0:12:14|0:12:18|Approaching closer, it was then discovered that the clear water was moving without any wind, which was quite strange.
0:12:18|0:12:28|The beauty raised her eyes to look at the mural in the room, and saw a three-eyed carp in the group of fish playing in the water on the wall, trembling with fear, knowing that the strange fish had hidden among them.
0:12:29|0:12:33|His face turned pale, his gaze darkened, and he stared intently at the strange fish.
0:12:33|0:12:44|Sure enough, when the strange fish's whereabouts were exposed, it tried to escape by casting a spell and flying out of the painting wall. But a beautiful woman suddenly conjured up a large net out of thin air, blocking the strange fish's escape route and binding it within.
0:12:44|0:12:49|Using his magical powers, [Zhuge Qingyun] compressed the body of the monster fish to the size of his palm and struck it fiercely several times.
0:12:49|0:12:53|After the strange fish behaved obediently, he looked towards [Dao Yichang] and [Xiao Yuan].
0:13:21|0:13:26|The beauty felt helpless, and with a glance, her eyes fell on a painting again.
0:14:19|0:14:26|The beauty waved her hand and erased the memory of [Dao Yichang]. When he woke up again, he found himself in front of a pancake stall.
0:15:14|0:15:50|In the second episode "Trouble at the Misty Shadow Gate" of the movie, as the vendors taunt the Knife Fish Factory, the scene shifts to the Misty Shadow Gate, a secretive organization that practices Yin and Yang Bagua to protect the world. At their hideout, one of the Misty Shadow wives, [Gui Jianchou], is seen copying the Qingming Riverside painting. He remarks that this painting is based on Kaifu's work, with two houses on each side of the river, creating a mysterious effect. Like, subscribe, share, and support the Mingjing and Didi programs.
0:16:26|0:16:29|This man with long hair is the head of the Mist Shadow Gate.
0:16:29|0:16:32|The two of them avoided the gaze of the hanging fish and continued to communicate.
0:16:56|0:17:5|As the two were talking, after hearing a loud noise, a dragon ball fell on the instrument detecting the formation. Seeing this, [Zhuge Qingyun] couldn't help but be surprised.
0:17:9|0:17:31|The scene shifts to the outskirts of Kaifeng City, where one of the wives of the blacksmith [Shunfeng Er] overhears the senior sister [Iron Dragonfly] giving orders and then taps on the ironware to inform the other brothers in the outskirts market using a secret code. They notice the surroundings paralyzed, with a strong man weaving a bamboo dragon and a painter drawing a pangolin. We have always suspected that the fire two days ago was related to the demon.
0:18:16|0:18:18|So the former sect leader left behind his last words.
0:18:36|0:18:46|He received a box in a teahouse in Luoyang, with the name of a weapon on it, which turned out to be the legendary artifact, the Divine Miracle.
0:18:55|0:19:10|Speak up, take out a bronze plate from the waist, place it in the palms and twist it. After a series of cracking sounds, the bronze plate stands in the air, turning into a bronze ball the size of a human head, with countless inscriptions on it.
0:19:10|0:19:14|Seeing this, all the senior brothers gathered around, waiting for [Master Guo]'s orders.
0:19:51|0:19:58|Leave the monster fish in the base to divert the enemy's attention.
0:19:58|0:20:1|Words spoken, orders followed, and everyone then went their separate ways.
0:20:1|0:20:5|Iron Qingting carved a mark on the pillars in the mansion after receiving the divine power.
0:20:13|0:20:24|The incident came to an end, and the scene shifted to the front of the most famous medical hall in Chang'an City, where a one-eyed doctor was muttering to himself.
0:20:24|0:20:39|The doctor, carrying a bamboo staff and a bag on his back, with a pair of sunglasses hanging in front of his eyes, walked towards the clinic with a sense of agility and grace, as if he was a [Xiao Yuan] drummer.
0:20:39|0:20:42|The movie "The Third Round" begins with Qimen seeking the escape armor.
0:22:7|0:22:10|After informing the knight about this, the curator said.
0:22:53|0:22:57|Upon hearing this, the Boss ordered his men to bring the doctor up.
0:23:36|0:23:42|She can not only do housework with one hand, but also lift up ten big men with the other hand.
0:25:27|0:25:34|Opened the iron gate, under the escort of a group of medical management students, the physician walked alone towards the deep underground prison.
0:25:34|0:25:39|As soon as the doctor took a few steps forward, the supervisor quickly closed the iron gate and locked it tightly.
0:25:39|0:25:42|A student whispered among the group.
0:25:56|0:26:6|Upon entering the dungeon, the doctor reached out and wiped his eyes. The bushy eyebrows returned to normal, revealing a hint of clarity and alertness.
0:26:7|0:26:20|He opened another iron door, only to find the stone walls inside covered with deep and shallow scratches, as if some kind of giant beast had vented its madness and resentment on these rocks with sharp claws.
0:26:20|0:26:27|The [Doctor] looked down and saw no monster, only a lovely and petite young girl who appeared to be in her late twenties.
0:28:4|0:28:9|Just as the two were teasing each other in a friendly atmosphere, they suddenly noticed the box in front of them.
0:28:38|0:28:45|In the attic of the second floor of a tavern in the city, a young lady from an unknown family suddenly screamed, causing chaos in the street.
0:28:45|0:29:0|Following the gaze of the young lady, under the scorching sun in the city of Kaifeng, countless earthworms were surging at some point, their bodies intertwining like thick red blood, curling up or panicking as they wriggled on the dusty road, causing great panic among the people in the city.
0:29:1|0:29:21|The city wall of Kaifeng, the meteorite that came from outside the sky shattered at this moment. The meteorite first cracked inch by inch, then a demonic light appeared, tearing it apart alive. Countless blood-red flesh strips suddenly protruded from the cracks, and the next second, the entire meteorite was completely shattered, and the monster emerged from it.
0:29:21|0:29:30|One could only see a body that was unlike any other, unafraid of human emotions, with only those intertwining and moving flesh strips. Their target is not us, but the ancestral temple.
0:30:1|0:30:5|The tremors gradually subsided, and the city guards began organizing a rescue operation.
0:30:19|0:30:25|The constable named Xiao Han arrived at the location of the broken stones and bricks, pushed aside the bricks, only to find a small box of broken silver coins.
0:30:25|0:30:27|At that moment, [Dao Yichang] said:
0:30:36|0:30:40|So, [Dao Yichang] leaped down from the ruins and shouted:
0:30:45|0:30:54|The boy, so serious, seeing no one responding, without hesitation, headed straight for the pit under the ancestral temple.
0:30:54|0:31:0|After delving deeper, the sunlight was unable to shine in, so he lit a match and shouted again.
0:31:10|0:31:17|Iron Dragonfly was preoccupied with the monster and didn't pay much attention to Dao Yichang. He changed to two junior brothers and continued on.
0:31:17|0:31:22|Dao Yichang is also particularly bold, following the rushing passage that collapsed.
0:31:22|0:31:28|They continued their journey deep into the underground.
0:31:28|0:31:35|Therefore, it was not a matter of luck. Two dazzling pearls shot out from the copper tube under his arm, illuminating the underworld.
0:32:17|0:32:25|Iron Dragonfly carefully listened to Old Ghost's speculation while reaching out to the railway track, only to be struck by an electric current and quickly withdrew his hand.
0:32:25|0:32:34|At this moment, [Dao Yichang] followed the cracks in the ground to the edge of the demon suppression formation, holding a torch. From a hole in the high cliff wall, he observed the group below.
0:32:35|0:32:43|Unexpectedly, a cunning [Iron Dragonfly] fell from a crevice, broke through the wooden planks, and landed in the ruins not far from the Demon Suppression Array.
0:32:43|0:32:51|The loud noise attracted Iron Dragonfly and the other two to quickly investigate. When they saw who it was, they couldn't help but exclaim.
0:33:3|0:33:14|Hearing a strange noise behind them, everyone turned to look at [Iron Dragonfly], and sure enough, the monster with bloody flesh strips was hovering in the air above the demon-suppressing formation.
0:33:14|0:33:32|Watching the huge monster flying in the void, [Iron Dragonfly] and the other two were not afraid, just staring at its every move. They saw the monster stop not far from the Fuyao Formation, twisting its body full of meat strips to form four heads, with the extra meat strips gathering behind it into the shape of wings.
0:33:32|0:33:51|When his spell was finally cast, a terrifying blood light burst from the monster's chest, almost illuminating the entire underground world. As if summoned by this blood light, the iron ball located on the demon-suppressing formation also began to stir, and a sudden demon wind carried debris and dust swirling around the iron ball.
0:33:51|0:33:59|The fierce demonic energy immediately swept over the entire ancient battlefield, causing [Iron Dragonfly] and the others to be almost unable to stand in the face of this demonic wind.
0:33:59|0:34:5|The remaining seal of the ancient demon formation also dissipated under the overwhelming demonic aura.
0:34:5|0:34:11|Glancing at the sudden appearance of the demon, and noticing the seal of Fumo Town loosening even more.
0:34:16|0:34:34|Alert like [Iron Dragonfly], naturally also noticed this point. Before the unexpected could finish speaking, he took out a wooden handle from his waist, threw it into the air, and saw the wooden handle transform into a delicate iron bow. However, before [Iron Dragonfly] could draw the bow and shoot the arrow, the blood demon seemed to sense something and headed towards the three people from the Mist Shadow Gate.
0:34:34|0:34:39|The strips of flesh all over the body began to shake violently, like an intimidating and impenetrable net.
0:34:39|0:34:58|The blood-red light on the chest of the demon suddenly dimmed, followed by an unprecedented burst of blood light, accompanied by unbearable laughter. The huge sound waves shook the entire ancient battlefield, almost visible to the naked eye, rushing towards everyone present.
0:34:58|0:35:2|Sharp laughter directly knocked down the three members of the Mist Shadow Gate and [Dao Yichang] to the ground.
0:35:4|0:35:7|Iron Dragonfly and others still have magic power in them, which can protect their vital energy.
0:35:7|0:35:14|Poor Dao Yichang, who was skilled in martial arts, vomited blood and passed out directly under the successive attacks.
0:35:14|0:35:23|The remaining power of the sword supporting the demon formation was exhausted, and the blood demon stopped laughing. The blood light on its chest flashed, attracting the iron balls in the formation towards itself.
0:35:24|0:35:44|In the glare of the blood light, the iron ball was melted due to the void in kung fu, and the monster inside finally revealed its true appearance. It had a beastly appearance, with two huge flesh wings hanging on its back, and its body was covered with bulging muscles like boulders. At first glance, it looked like a beastman clad in armor, exuding a more intimidating aura than the blood demon.
0:35:53|0:35:57|Shunfeng Er rushed towards the two monsters.
0:35:57|0:36:2|Unexpectedly, before [Iron Dragonfly] could advance to the battlefront, the beastman shook its wings and flew towards him.
0:36:2|0:36:7|As soon as they met, the orc gathered its flesh wings and sent [Iron Dragonfly] flying out.
0:36:7|0:36:12|Following closely behind, [Boss] and his gang were also sent flying by the orc's strike, crashing heavily to the ground.
0:36:13|0:36:19|Their skills were no match for the [Iron Dragonfly] behind them. With just one blow, they spat out blood, unable to fight back.
0:36:19|0:36:27|Iron Dragonfly, unwilling to give up, managed to stand up and evade the fatal blow from the orc. He then took out an iron chain in an attempt to trap the orc.
0:36:27|0:36:33|Little did they know that the orc was incredibly powerful. His divine ability, Iron Chains, only managed to restrain the orc for a few seconds before it was destroyed.
0:36:34|0:36:49|The skinny man regarded [Iron Dragonfly] as thunder, then immediately flipped him over with a palm, followed by a dim lake light shining on his palm, and a powerful and irresistible sharp force pulling [Iron Dragonfly] towards the skinny man's palm.
0:36:50|0:37:8|At this critical moment, Dao Yichang finally woke up and, without thinking, drew the long knife from his waist and slashed at the orc in front of him. The orc, who was disturbed, had to throw down the iron jug and turned around to grab Dao Yichang's arm that was wielding the knife.
0:37:8|0:37:26|The monster's hand was still as hot as ever, in a split second, [Dao Yichang] lost sensation in his arm. Then the beastman cut off [Dao Yichang]'s left leg with one winged hand. Seeing this, [Iron Dragonfly] didn't hesitate, pounced and destroyed [Dao Yichang]'s body, only to be left with a half-eaten meat arm by the beastman.
0:37:26|0:37:28|Already turned into chicken powder.
0:37:33|0:37:43|Iron Dragonfly and the others never expected the orc to be so powerful. With just one move, they were completely suppressed and had no ability to fight back. In this situation, they had no choice but to retreat first and make a new plan.
0:37:44|0:37:59|Seeing the orc flapping its wings towards them, [Shunfeng Er] quickly took out several copper balls from his sleeve and threw them onto the surrounding stone walls. In the blink of an eye, explosions resounded, and the falling rocks instantly buried the orc. The three of them, along with [Dao Yichang], took advantage of the situation and escaped into the sky.
0:37:59|0:38:11|Not long after the group left, they saw the beastman break through the pile of rocks and fly towards the blood demon. The blood-colored demon floating in the air stared at the beastman for a moment, then spoke, saying that the beastman and itself should merge into one.
0:38:19|0:38:25|Hearing the Blood Demon speak like that, the Orc couldn't contain his anger and flapped his wings to throw several huge rocks over.
0:39:11|0:39:31|Two monsters roared and left, the scene shifted to outside the Kaifeng Capture House.
0:39:35|0:39:40|Shunfeng Er and his junior apprentice brother jumped off the eaves to go and assist Iron Dragonfly and the others.
0:39:43|0:39:50|Upon hearing this news, Iron Dragonfly was extremely excited and quickly looked outside the house.
0:40:3|0:40:7|Standing at the door is the blind physician Zhuge Qingyun.
0:40:7|0:40:11|This person, if replaced by [Zhuge Qingyun], is also one of the hidden wives of the object.
0:40:11|0:40:16|Behind him is the girl brought out from the medical hall, [Xiao Yuan].
0:40:16|0:40:24|Temporarily leaving Xiao Yuan behind, Zhuge Qingyun spoke up.
0:40:35|0:40:42|Nodding his head back, everyone looked in the direction he pointed and saw the extremely timid girl.
0:40:42|0:40:51|In the midst of these extremely surprised looks, [Xiao Yuan] stuck to the back of [Zhuge Qingyun], her arms tightly wrapped around him.
0:41:8|0:41:9|Listening to what [Xiao Yuan] said,
0:41:9|0:41:12|All the junior martial brothers were stunned on the spot.
0:41:12|0:41:19|[Iron Dragonfly] anxiously inquired in code, and [Zhuge Qingyun] responded confidently.
0:41:32|0:41:38|[Zhuge Qingyun] tended to Dao Yichang's wound while responding with a nod.
0:41:38|0:41:47|The scene then returned to the scene in the dungeon that day.
0:41:47|0:42:7|In the memory, [Xiao Mingxuan], who was swallowing food with big mouth, suddenly became extremely ferocious, with a shining light in his eyes. After a moment, countless feathers burst out from under his skin, illuminated by the thin sunlight in the dungeon. Those feathers, as if alive, slowly circulated with different colors.
0:42:7|0:42:21|In just the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, [Xiao Yuan] has transformed drastically, turning into a magnificent monster resembling a peacock, with sharp claws immediately closing in on [Zhuge Qingyun]. In the narrow dungeon, there is simply nowhere to hide.
0:42:21|0:42:26|After the rainstorm, [Zhuge Qingyun] was dragged by the monster and fell down on the stone steps.
0:42:31|0:42:59|At a critical moment, he suddenly realized that the shining spot between the chest and abdomen of the monster was its vital point. He then pinched several silver needles and threw them directly at the monster's nose. As the silver needles entered its body, they temporarily blocked the monster's meridians. The huge body of the monster instantly dissipated, leaving only [Xiao Yuan] naked and limp in the arms of [Zhuge Qingyun]. Why were they hugging each other? Actually, no one has ever hugged me before, it feels quite nice.
0:43:2|0:43:7|After listening to his explanation, the junior disciples all expressed doubt, with [Iron Dragonfly] being the most vocal.
0:44:35|0:44:40|Iron Dragonfly got really angry, let out a roar, and threw Xiao Yuan directly into Zhuge Qingyun's arms.
0:45:1|0:45:2|The scene shifts to outside the Kaifeng yamen.
0:45:14|0:45:23|On a rainy night, the maimed [Dao Yichang] was abandoned on the street by his former colleagues, the pouring rain slowly diluting his last trace of body heat.
0:45:23|0:45:41|On the roof, the sulking [Iron Dragonfly] witnessed the scene and suddenly felt a pang of guilt. After the other constables left, he quietly approached [Dao Yichang], took off his own hat, and held it up to cover [Dao Yichang]'s face, without saying a word, just silently watching the man who had lost his hands and feet trying to save him.
0:45:42|0:46:2|The raindrops were cold, but [Iron Dragonfly] seemed to see the hidden fervor in the pale face of the man in front of him, as if sensing something. [Dao Yichang] struggled to open his eyes and looked at the somewhat confused and desolate eyes. The softness in [Iron Dragonfly]'s heart was touched again, and she carried [Dao Yichang] on her back.
0:46:2|0:46:4|Brought back the temporary shelter where the Wuying were staying.
0:46:5|0:46:24|In the room, [Iron Dragonfly] was taking care of [Dao Yichang] with a hint of guilt. Seeing this scene, [Zhuge Qingyun] smiled lightly, standing outside the room. When [Iron Dragonfly] walked out of the room and gently closed the door with his own hands, [Zhuge Qingyun] looked deeply at [Dao Yichang] who had just dressed up, then asked [Iron Dragonfly] who had come to his side.
0:46:39|0:46:49|Saying that, [Zhuge Qingyun] took out a wooden box from his bosom.
0:47:48|0:47:55|[Zhuge Qingyun] was not sentimental at all, he slapped fiercely, feeling this unique affection, and both of them burst into laughter.
0:48:15|0:48:23|During the day, the Kaifeng city was in ruins, but at night, amidst the wind and moon, the bustling sounds of people still echoed across the Three Lives.
0:48:23|0:48:31|The mysterious sound, echoing through the desolate and frozen buildings, resonated in the deepest alleys of Kaifeng city, enticing the passing guests to immerse themselves in it.
0:48:32|0:48:38|Iron Dragonfly paid no attention to these, changed into the attire of a noble son, and entered the pavilion, looking around with amusement.
0:48:41|0:48:48|Upon seeing Iron Dragonfly, Jiaojiao couldn't care less about her image and directly screamed out loud.
0:49:9|0:49:22|With a sigh, [Gui Jianchou] waited boredly with [Xiao Yuan] as she pointed at the heavily made-up girls and asked why their eyes were blurry and mouths full of blood, were they all injured?
0:49:46|0:49:48|No one has ever known.
0:50:52|0:51:5|After obtaining the information left by the sect leader, the two of them returned to the temporary base and informed everyone. After discussing the relevant plans, the group then packed their bags and prepared to head to Luoyang. [Shunfeng Er] turned to the senior brothers and said.
0:51:14|0:51:19|In the carriage, [Xiao Yuan] called out to [Zhuge Qingyun] and pointed to the musk beside her, asking.
0:51:22|0:51:25|On the other side, Iron Dragonfly also made plans for Dao Yichang.
0:52:27|0:52:42|The so-called special equipment turned out to be a pair of metal arms and legs. Watching [Dao Yichang] struggling to adapt to the new limbs, a hint of guilt flashed across the handsome face of [Iron Dragonfly]. He knew that the favor he owed could not be repaid so easily.
0:52:54|0:53:1|Having had his memory wiped, he naturally doesn't remember that his sword has been lost under the Taizu Temple.
0:53:1|0:53:5|In silence, the group left Kaifeng City under the cold night.
0:53:5|0:53:16|Entering the dense forest, the tranquility and vitality along the way slowed down the pace of everyone, allowing them to feel the brief peace around them while also being wary of the upcoming unknown bloody battle.
0:53:51|0:53:57|Dao Yichang's mouth twitched a few times, forcing a smile and said.
0:53:57|0:54:2|[Xiao Yuan] was very excited, poking her head out of the carriage and shouting at the beautiful scenery around her.
0:54:13|0:54:17|The sudden farce relaxed everyone a bit.
0:54:17|0:54:20|[Boss] leaned over and said to [Iron Dragonfly].
0:54:29|0:54:31|After listening to what [Boss] said.
0:54:31|0:54:34|Iron Dragonfly gave a slight smile, indicating his agreement with what he said.
0:54:34|0:54:40|The scene then shifts to the Longmen Grottoes in Luoyang, where the fourth episode of the movie "The Martial Arts Gathering of Divine Machinery" begins.
0:54:40|0:54:45|Under the giant body of the stone cave's Buddha, a figure in coarse cloth lay on the ground and said.
0:55:41|0:55:53|The leaders of the five major sects gathered around Master Cubu, only to see him holding a huge box in his hands. With a strong push, he opened the box.
0:55:53|0:55:56|Seeing this, [Boss] questioned sternly.
0:56:45|0:56:53|During the performance, after the Eternal Yanwang finished speaking, he expressed his willingness to exchange the box in Tangmen Tangkun's hands.
0:56:53|0:56:55|Gai Bang leader [Ba Bi Yuan] said.
0:57:5|0:57:11|Ba Bi Yuan used his divine power on the Divine Machine, and saw it transform into a spring entwining around his hands.
0:57:11|0:57:21|In the blink of an eye, the clear spring turned into a fiery appearance and was taken away by [Master of Blazing Fire].
0:57:21|0:57:28|So, in the Longmen Grottoes, the flames were blazing, and the Divine Mechanism transformed into its final form, turning out to be a divine weapon made of metal.
0:58:3|0:58:9|Speak up, [Shen Suan Zi] eyes gleamed with the essence of the Tao, said [Diancang Pai sect leader].
0:58:26|0:58:39|The powerful spell was cast, and [Leader of Diancang Sect] instantly fell into a void.
0:58:39|0:58:47|Speak up, Zhuge Qingyun, Iron Dragonfly, Shen Suan Zi, with countless bloody flesh strips protruding from his body, directly shattered the void space used to bind himself.
0:58:47|0:59:5|It was the blood demon from the meteorite from outer space. Sensing the sudden surge of demon energy, the five sect leaders and [Shen Suan Zi] were stunned on the spot. However, a gust of demon wind swept by, snatching the Divine Machine from the hands of [Master Liehuo]. Judging from his figure, he was the beast demon from the bottom of the ancestral temple. Only to hear him speak out loud.
0:59:32|0:59:35|Feeling the changes in everyone's bodies, the Undying King said.
0:59:45|0:59:50|As soon as they entered the garden, the [Ba Bi Yuan] displayed extraordinary skills, just as the demon had predicted.
0:59:50|0:59:53|The leaders of the five major sects in the world now have to obey his orders.
0:59:53|1:0:3|Looking at the river in front of the grotto again, under the influence of [Ba Bi Yuan]'s divine power, several water dragons condensed from it, heading straight towards [Shen Suan Zi], and the spiritual pearl in his hand was also snatched away by the Blood Demon in an instant.
1:0:4|1:0:19|[Shen Suan Zi] was shocked and dismayed. Meeting with the leaders of the five major sects today, he never expected such a scene. Facing the five powerful factions alone, plus the demonic person, he had no chance of winning. The only plan now was to wait for an opportunity to escape and make new plans.
1:0:19|1:0:26|[Shen Suan Zi] transformed the paper umbrella in his hand in countless ways, using it as a copper wall and iron barrier to defend against the water dragon, but then heard the monster speak again.
1:0:29|1:0:40|The words were followed by actions, as the formidable and ageless King Yanwang transformed into a dense black mist, within which numerous withered palms entangled and advanced towards [Shen Suan Zi].
1:0:40|1:0:45|Xuan Xian dodged the black mist and saw the poisonous darts of the Tangmen sect appearing above his head.
1:0:45|1:0:51|Shen Suan Zi could only use the shifting technique again, turning into a green smoke on the body of the giant Buddha, rolling and tossing.
1:0:53|1:0:58|At this moment, Wu Dingfei's ring shattered the palm of the giant Buddha, smashing down hard on the wisp of green smoke.
1:0:58|1:1:8|The Grandmaster of Fierce Fire unleashed a fierce fire palm, wrapping the severed hand tightly, the scorching flames cracking the stones apart, but there was no trace of [Shen Suan Zi] within.
1:1:52|1:2:5|The two monsters turned out to be from the outside world, one resembling a white tiger and the other entwined with bloody flesh like red wood. The mysterious mechanism that drove the heroes of the martial arts world crazy was intricately connected to these monsters.
1:2:5|1:2:8|It's just because it's been so long ago that no one knows anymore.
1:2:8|1:2:13|On the other side, deep in the desert, Iron Dragonfly and his group are heading towards Luoyang.
1:2:32|1:2:38|Speak up, [Zhuge Qingyun] began to search for the Ghostly Divine Manor. After an unknown period of time, the group arrived at a valley.
1:2:53|1:2:59|The group dismounted and quickly organized themselves before entering the Divine Manor, with [Zhuge Qingyun] leading the way and giving reminders.
1:4:17|1:4:27|Iron Dragonfly leaped down the stone steps and leaned against Dao Yichang. This scene happened to catch the eye of Zhuge Qingyun, so he reached out and patted Xiao Yuan.
1:4:46|1:4:51|Upon hearing Iron Dragonfly's resentful words again, Xiao Yuan was stunned for a long time before speaking.
1:5:16|1:5:17|Xiao Yuan is like this.
1:5:59|1:6:2|Dao Yichang looked at the scene and sighed.
1:6:55|1:6:59|Speak up, [Dao Yichang] limped away as if in a trance.
1:6:59|1:7:4|Seeing his nervous appearance, his fellow brothers behind him couldn't help but chuckle.
1:7:4|1:7:11|The storm outside is still howling, and the dark clouds behind seem to be nailed to the sky above the Shen Manor, without any sign of movement.
1:7:12|1:7:18|The atmosphere here seemed particularly eerie, and the sudden silence indoors made [Xiao Yuan] feel a bit uneasy.
1:7:18|1:7:29|She curled up in the box, holding a long-withered plant in her hand. Under her gaze, the wilted petals and curled leaves unexpectedly began to grow again.
1:7:29|1:7:38|Outside the box, [Zhuge Qingyun] seemed to sense something, and as he turned his head, he discovered the long-dead vines in the corner, now bursting with new life.
1:7:38|1:7:43|Even more strangely, when it came to a scene where the severed limb wound was located, an unbearable pain erupted.
1:7:46|1:8:5|Just as he was examining the wound of [Dao Yichang], a sudden gust of wind swept through the entire divine manor, causing even the most ordinary candles to burn more fiercely than usual. Inside the box, [Xiao Yuan] seemed to be completely unaware, continuously channeling her powers into the flowers in her hands, feeling the intense demonic energy that almost swept across the vast open land.
1:8:5|1:8:8|The disciples of the Wuying Sect became alert in an instant.
1:8:8|1:8:11|[Zhuge Qingyun] said to [Dao Yichang],
1:8:13|1:8:23|Afterwards, not daring to delay, Zhuge Qingyun gathered with many fellow disciples, hiding behind large rocks, right next to the surging demonic energy all around. Boss, holding an iron rod in hand, spoke up.
1:8:26|1:8:36|After a moment, the demonic energy wrapped in years of accumulated dry leaves and dust rolled through the entire Ghostly Divine Manor. Everyone abandoned the divine spirits and remained vigilant in every possible place where demonic beasts might appear.
1:8:36|1:8:45|At this moment, the wooden box where [Xiao Yuan] was located suddenly started shaking violently, causing loose rocks on the cliff to fall down as well.
1:8:45|1:8:49|Feeling the strong demonic energy, the monster behind [Zhuge Qingyun] reminded.
1:8:53|1:9:1|Watching [Iron Dragonfly] again, standing alone under the stone wall, with a secret signal in hand, informing everyone that the demonic energy is strong, ordering everyone to prepare for battle.
1:9:1|1:9:7|After seeing the hand signals, the brothers were inspired and quickly changed into their combat attire, searching for attack positions.
1:9:8|1:9:21|At this moment, the wooden box where [Xiao Yuan] was suddenly burst open, and a peacock-like monster emerged from it, laughing and shouting. Just as [Zhuge Qingyun] had seen in the dungeon that day, compared to before, this monster's momentum was even more impressive.
1:9:21|1:9:26|So, the monster opened its mouth and spoke.
1:9:26|1:9:35|Looking at the huge monster in front of them, different from the one they had seen under the ancestral temple, everyone was a bit stunned. [Zhuge Qingyun] was also at a loss, and Qianli Yan directly spoke up and asked.
1:9:40|1:9:44|As soon as the words fell, the monster rushed towards everyone.
1:9:44|1:9:51|Iron Dragonfly was unable to dodge in time, and was lifted by the monster's palm, hitting the surrounding stone pillars and falling heavily into a pit on the ground.
1:9:56|1:10:2|Seeing the monster charging towards him, [Iron Dragonfly] didn't hesitate, reaching out for [Dao Yichang] to pull him up onto the arm.
1:10:2|1:10:12|At a critical moment, [Zhuge Qingyun] arrived just in time. He used the Vertical Branch Needle technique to directly attack the vital point of the monster, but the monster easily deflected it with its wings.
1:10:12|1:10:18|The next moment, the sharp claws directly pinned Zhuge Qingyun to the ground, leaving him helpless as he struggled against the monster.
1:10:21|1:10:27|Seeing [Zhuge Qingyun] in a dangerous situation, [Iron Dragonfly] leaped onto the monster's neck to engage in a fierce battle.
1:10:27|1:10:32|The demon beast, though slightly affected, still managed to control Zhuge Qingyun's minions without letting up.
1:10:32|1:10:36|Iron Dragonfly, in a desperate attempt to save someone, lost focus and was once again thrown by the monster, falling to the ground.
1:10:52|1:11:11|Finally, hearing the familiar call from the man, the demon's mind became unstable, and its demonic power dissipated in an instant. Its huge body turned into ashes, with [Xiao Yuan] wrapped inside, just like the scene in the dungeon that day, naked and unconscious, softly leaning in the arms of [Zhuge Qingyun].
1:11:12|1:11:21|On the other side, [Dao Yichang] climbed to the side of [Iron Dragonfly] to show concern, but [Iron Dragonfly]'s gaze remained on [Zhuge Qingyun], who was taking care of [Xiao Yuan].
1:11:26|1:11:31|Seeing [Zhuge Qingyun] looking at him, [Dao Yichang] quickly withdrew his hand from resting on [Iron Dragonfly]'s shoulder.
1:11:33|1:11:42|Upon seeing Xiao Yuan regain consciousness, Zhuge Qingyun was about to say something, but Iron Dragonfly walked towards him, so he didn't speak and just looked at him.
1:11:48|1:11:51|After exchanging greetings, everyone prepared to leave.
1:11:51|1:11:58|Seeing that he didn't trouble [Xiao Yuan], [Zhuge Qingyun] finally coughed uncontrollably into the lung fluid in the dry warehouse.
1:11:58|1:12:6|Quotes are unnecessary. The group arrived in Luoyang City overnight, where the bustling crowd and busy streets painted a picture of prosperity.
1:13:0|1:13:4|Passing through the bustling crowd, everyone arrived at an inn to take a temporary rest.
1:14:1|1:14:9|Perhaps out of guilt, [Zhuge Qingyun] spoke these words with particular sincerity, and [Dao Yichang] was moved by them.
1:14:9|1:14:16|Since becoming a constable, [Dao Yichang] felt cared for for the first time. After composing himself, he replied solemnly.
1:14:18|1:14:27|Upon hearing his response, [Zhuge Qingyun] didn't linger and turned to walk downstairs. After a farewell gaze, he shook his head in confusion and headed towards the guest room.
1:14:27|1:14:36|At this moment, the wound at the broken weaving spot started to ache intensely again, and [Xiao Yuan], who was sitting by the bed in the room, quietly spoke.
1:15:33|1:15:45|In the second-floor guest room, [Xiao Yuan] gently placed her palm on the shoulder where [Dao Yichang]'s severed limb was located, then cautiously guided her energy towards the wound.
1:15:45|1:15:51|Upon seeing [Dao Yichang], there was a huge reaction, fresh blood surged from the wound, the abdominal flesh retracted, and the heart flesh grew.
1:15:51|1:15:59|Xiao Yuan no longer hesitated, tightly grabbing Dao Yichang's shoulders with both hands, and then poured the surging divine power in her body into the wound.
1:16:0|1:16:9|Accompanied by the uncontrollable screams of [Dao Yichang], the wound where the limb was severed showed a mixture of white bones and flesh, miraculously regenerating intact once again.
1:16:9|1:16:14|Meanwhile, Xiao Yuan's already pale face had become completely bloodless.
1:16:28|1:16:34|Before he could even ask what happened, he felt the piercing pain in his left leg wound.
1:16:34|1:16:46|In his arms, [Xiao Yuan] was forced to use his supernatural powers, causing blood to overflow from the top of his head.
1:16:46|1:16:53|When that kind of pain dissipates, a left leg grows out.
1:17:7|1:17:25|Seeing [Xiao Yuan], who was almost fainting on the bed due to excessive consumption, [Dao Yichang] got up and walked towards the washbasin. However, as someone who had experienced limb regeneration, he was not yet accustomed to his new body and stumbled as he took the towel. After wetting it with clean water, he returned to the bedside and wiped the bloodstains off [Xiao Yuan]'s face before speaking.
1:19:18|1:19:24|Just as the two were feeling sad secretly, Old Ghost discovered the secret signal of [Boss] in the food tray.
1:19:24|1:19:28|At the sound of this, everyone immediately perked up and looked into the plates.
1:19:30|1:19:38|Finally, the whereabouts of [Boss] have been discovered, and everyone immediately set off to search for him among the bustling crowd.
1:19:38|1:19:43|At the same time, both [Xiao Yuan] and [Iron Dragonfly] sensed an unusual aura.
1:19:43|1:19:50|Speak. [Iron Dragonfly] led his junior brothers to guard around the inn, while [Zhuge Qingyun] headed towards the room where [Xiao Yuan] was staying.
1:19:50|1:19:56|At this moment, two golden copper flying rings suddenly appeared, it was the unique hidden weapon of [Tangmen Tangkun] - the Crownless Flying Ring.
1:19:58|1:20:3|On the second floor of the inn, [Xiao Yuan] was already in a daze, muttering incessantly.
1:20:3|1:20:11|As the unpredictable flying ring was about to hit Zhuge Qingyun's secret door, Iron Dragonfly swung the diamond finger shield and hammer fiercely smashed onto the flying ring.
1:20:11|1:20:20|With one strike, the two flying rings unexpectedly released countless attacks, shattering the hammer in Iron Dragonfly's hand and causing heavy injuries, spitting out blood from the mouth.
1:20:20|1:20:26|At that moment, countless flying rings were spinning and colliding in the inn, with Tangmen Tangkun controlling the unpredictable flying ring, attacking everyone recklessly.
1:20:27|1:20:38|Seeing the situation, [Qianli Yan] and [Chuanshan Jia] kicked [Tangmen Tangkun] onto the scaffolding, hoping to restrain him. Even [Shunfeng Er] also exerted force, using various magical techniques and spells towards [Tangmen Tangkun].
1:20:38|1:20:44|It was just that Tangmen Tangkun's martial arts were strong, and everyone fought desperately, but they were all broken by him one by one.
1:20:44|1:20:48|Subsequently, under the command of [Zhuge Qingyun], they successfully repelled the intruders.
1:20:48|1:20:53|Seeing the situation, [Zhuge Qingyun] didn't dare to delay, and flew up to the second floor, only to be pulled down by [Dao Yichang].
1:21:0|1:21:5|Upon hearing the urgent message from Dao Yichang, [Zhuge Qingyun] immediately put [Xiao Yuan] on his back and prepared to leave.
1:21:5|1:21:14|At the same time, Iron Dragonfly blended in with the bandits, went straight in with a single sword, avoiding the flying rings around, directly entered the formation, and engaged in close combat with Tangmen Tangkun.
1:21:14|1:21:26|Unexpectedly, Tangmen Tangkun's martial arts skills were also exceptional. After just a few moves, he found a loophole and managed to inject poison mist into Iron Dragonfly's arm. With this blow, Iron Dragonfly fell into the inn and was unable to continue the fight.
1:21:56|1:22:5|During the argument between the two, [Dao Yichang] was anxious and sat on the ground with his left foot, only to find that the force of this foot pushed him directly into the air.
1:22:5|1:22:19|At the moment of landing, [Dao Yichang] unexpectedly stood in front of [Zhuge Qingyun] and [Iron Dragonfly]. The unsteady flying ring, as strong as gold and stone, was just a palm's distance away from him. [Dao Yichang] was greatly shocked but helpless, so he squeezed his eyes, raised his hands, and blocked them in front of his face.
1:22:19|1:22:23|Unexpectedly, the anticipated heavy blow did not materialize.
1:22:23|1:22:28|Opening his eyes, Zhuge Qingyun realized that the unpredictable flying rings were actually under his control, stopping in front of the three of them.
1:22:28|1:22:34|Dao Yichang tentatively waved his hand, and the flying ring directly knocked Tangmen Tangkun into a shop in the market.
1:22:37|1:22:43|Speak up, without caring about the reasons, everyone prepared to retreat.
1:22:43|1:22:44|Zhuge Qingyun says no more.
1:22:44|1:22:53|Picking up [Xiao Yuan] on his back, he immediately walked towards the outside, climbed over the inn's wall, looked around but didn't see [Dao Yichang]'s figure, then turned around and said to [Zhuge Qingyun].
1:22:56|1:23:2|The two of them then looked in the direction of the inn for a long time, and [Iron Dragonfly] hesitated for a moment before speaking.
1:23:2|1:23:13|At the same time, Dao Yichang is confronting Tangmen Tangkun, watching as Tangkun approaches step by step, Dao Yichang can only hold on defensively.
1:23:13|1:23:21|Just at this moment, his newly grown left leg seemed to have a mind of its own, not obeying commands, and intentionally or unintentionally stepping on a bamboo stick.
1:23:21|1:23:24|With a kick from him, the bamboo stick smashed directly onto Tangkun's face.
1:23:24|1:23:32|Following that, [Dao Yichang] clapped his hands and flew into the air, then astonishingly delivered a heavy blow with his head, knocking [Tangkun] down to his knees on the ground.
1:23:34|1:23:42|On the other side, as Iron Dragonfly and Zhuge Qingyun just emerged from the alley, they saw a carriage speeding towards them and coming to a smooth stop not far ahead.
1:23:59|1:24:16|Accompanied by three people, [Shen Suan Zi] drove the carriage forward with a crack of the whip, while [Dao Yichang] was still entangled with [Tangmen Tangkun]. [Dao Yichang] showed no fear as he advanced straight towards [Tangmen Tangkun], leaving the sect leader [Tangmen Tangkun] struggling against the young man before him.
1:24:16|1:24:24|[Dao Yichang] reached out and restrained [Tangmen Tangkun], lifting him up in the air, making it difficult for him to move. At that moment, [Master Liehu] suddenly arrived without saying a word.
1:24:24|1:24:31|In a fierce battle, the raging flames of Iron Dragonfly quickly engulfed Tangmen Tangkun, while Dao Yichang emerged unscathed.
1:24:40|1:24:42|No need to say more about [Master Liehuo].
1:24:42|1:24:48|The surging divine power boosted the power of [Master of Blazing Fire] to the maximum, then rushed towards [Dao Yichang].
1:24:48|1:24:55|[Dao Yichang] is gradually adapting to his new power and fearlessly moving forward, confronting the [Grandmaster of Blazing Fire].
1:24:55|1:25:5|The moment the two made contact, the red flames on [Master of Fierce Fire] surprisingly couldn't penetrate [Dao Yichang], but instead, [Master of Fierce Fire] suffered greatly, his whole body enveloped in red flames, in excruciating pain.
1:25:5|1:25:14|Dao Yichang saw the situation and knocked him down from the air with one palm, falling to the ground. In the blink of an eye, the blazing flames turned the Fire Master into a handful of chicken powder.
1:25:14|1:25:19|On the other side, [Shen Suan Zi] led [Iron Dragonfly] and two others to the woods on the outskirts of Luoyang City.
1:25:19|1:25:28|The fifth episode of the movie "The Destruction of the Wuying Gate" officially begins.
1:25:28|1:25:35|Several people walked to a remote corner, only to see [Shen Suan Zi] transform himself into the [Boss] of "Shadow Gate", causing [Iron Dragonfly] to exclaim in surprise.
1:25:55|1:26:1|So now, [Boss] watched as [Xiao Yuan] was placed under a tree by the others, and spoke up.
1:26:1|1:26:20|Just as he was about to continue speaking, [Iron Dragonfly] seemed to have a sudden realization and gestured to [Boss] to be quiet. Then, he used sign language to communicate with [Boss] for a long time, staring at the ever-changing hand gestures of [Iron Dragonfly]. It seemed that [Boss] understood the meaning of his actions, and immediately took out a piece of cloth from his pocket and wrote on it.
1:26:21|1:26:31|Seeing the words on the cloth and witnessing [Boss] being so certain about [Xiao Yuan]'s identity, [Zhuge Qingyun] felt a moment of confusion. He stared at the circle drawn by [Xiao Yuan] for a while before finally speaking.
1:26:39|1:27:1|This has nothing to do with whether you believe it or not. I know you too well. [Iron Dragonfly] stopped [Zhuge Qingyun] who was about to go to the end of the circle of [Xiao Yuan]. [Iron Dragonfly] walked forward on his own because he helped [Dao Yichang] regain his limbs. At this point, [Xiao Yuan] was already exhausted, lying against a tree completely unable to move, only watching [Iron Dragonfly] with a cold expression.
1:27:1|1:27:4|Approaching step by step towards himself.
1:27:4|1:27:7|Squatting down in front of [Xiao Yuan], [Iron Dragonfly] spoke.
1:27:41|1:27:54|After saying these words, [Xiao Yuan] held up [Iron Dragonfly]'s poisoned left arm, using her limited divine powers to force the toxins out of his body. It seemed to touch [Iron Dragonfly], who choked up and said.
1:27:54|1:27:59|On the other side, Zhuge Qingyun stared at Boss beside him, recalling the scene of Iron Dragonfly leaving just now.
1:28:1|1:28:21|Just now, when [Iron Dragonfly] blocked himself from approaching [Xiao Yuan], he gestured with his hands on his abdomen. Beside him, [Boss] couldn't understand the secret language of "Wuyingmen." [Zhuge Qingyun] immediately shouted out, realizing his identity was exposed, the person no longer concealed himself and immediately used his skills to force [Zhuge Qingyun] back. Seeing this, [Iron Dragonfly] spoke up.
1:28:27|1:28:32|Currently, [Xiao Yuan] is extremely weak, like a mosquito, unable to stop [Iron Dragonfly].
1:28:32|1:28:37|Iron Dragonfly threw a flying knife at Boss in the air.
1:28:37|1:28:42|The man remained calm and composed, with a flick of his sleeve, completely reversing the offensive of [Iron Dragonfly].
1:28:42|1:28:51|The flying knives were actually heading towards Iron Dragonfly. Seeing Zhuge Qingyun anxious, he flew in front of Iron Dragonfly and used the bamboo staff in his hand to shatter those flying knives one by one.
1:28:52|1:28:57|Then he immediately displayed his divine power, creating billowing smoke to surround himself with [Iron Dragonfly], waiting for an opportunity to escape.
1:28:57|1:29:6|Jia [Boss] saw that the two were nowhere to be found, but he didn't care. Instead, he galloped towards [Xiao Yuan], his powerful momentum causing the surroundings to wither overnight and the earth to tremble.
1:29:6|1:29:15|Just as the man was about to crash into Xiao Yuan, a figure suddenly leaped out from the ground and carried Xiao Yuan away from Boss Jia's attack range.
1:29:15|1:29:23|When suddenly appeared, [Xiao Yuan] stopped the person in the circle, turned around, and everyone finally saw that this person actually had the appearance of the boss of the Mistaken Door.
1:29:28|1:29:36|Speak up, the two's gaze gathered on the newly appeared [Boss], only to see him gesturing in sign language, indicating the two to protect [Xiao Yuan] and leave this place.
1:29:40|1:29:51|Validating the identity of [Boss], the two immediately took [Xiao Yuan] and left in a hurry. At the same time, the fake [Boss] also approached them, revealing his true identity as one of the martial arts sect leaders, the Eternal King of Hell.
1:30:2|1:30:18|The eternal Yanwang transformed into a dense black mist, entwined with countless wooden arms, swirling with the surrounding dry leaves and dust, moving towards [Boss]. On the other side, [Boss] remained unfazed, responding with summoning numerous divine soldiers to engage with it.
1:30:18|1:30:31|At this moment, several water dragons suddenly rose from the nearby river, piercing through [Boss] and the immortal Yanwang in the blink of an eye. [Boss] fell to the ground, with chaotic spiritual patterns inside his body, and a mouthful of blood gushed out.
1:30:55|1:31:7|Ba Biyun waved his hand, summoning several water dragons again, trapping the Undying King, [Boss], along with [Zhuge Qingyun] and [Iron Dragonfly]. Then, he unleashed his divine power, seemingly about to oppress these few people to death.
1:31:7|1:31:15|In the end, not living long, the Old Yanwang used all his strength to curse.
1:31:15|1:31:19|Speak up, then was pinched to death by Ba Bi Yun using his divine power, with all his meridians severed.
1:31:19|1:31:22|Seeing this, [Zhuge Qingyun] said to [Iron Dragonfly].
1:31:30|1:31:38|Under the pressure of the Water Dragon, [Iron Dragonfly] had a trace of blood at the corner of his mouth, and he turned to look behind him, only to find that [Boss] had already fallen silent, so he spoke sadly.
1:31:59|1:32:2|Before his death, [Zhuge Qingyun] said.
1:32:2|1:32:4|Soon after, [Zhuge Qingyun] and [Iron Dragonfly] set off together.
1:32:18|1:32:25|Seeing these friends who have been with her day and night dying in front of her, the hatred in [Xiao Yuan]'s heart has reached its peak.
1:32:25|1:32:35|In his resentment, he laughed up to the sky with unknown strength, and the hidden supernatural power deep in his soul spread throughout the entire forest.
1:32:35|1:32:44|[Zhuge Qingyun]'s bamboo staff, which he used during his lifetime, responded to his call and began to tremble slightly, floating in his heart. Then, with a sudden thrust, it pierced through Xiao Yuan's chest.
1:32:44|1:32:50|In this moment of distraction, [Xiao Yuan]'s supernatural power was enough to take over the water dragon controlled by Ba Bi Yuan.
1:32:50|1:32:56|In the blink of an eye, [Xiao Yuan] controlled those water dragons and pierced through the chest of Ba Bi Yuan.
1:32:56|1:32:59|The forest has finally returned to its former tranquility.
1:32:59|1:33:8|Time passed slowly, and almost losing consciousness, [Zhuge Qingyun] vaguely sensed that his vitality was gradually returning to his body.
1:33:8|1:33:14|After he fully regained consciousness, he found himself completely unharmed, without even a hair out of place, too rushed to think about what had happened.
1:33:19|1:33:24|After probing, it was discovered that [Iron Dragonfly] had actually survived, and [Zhuge Qingyun] quickly ran towards [Xiao Yuan].
1:33:34|1:33:41|[Zhuge Qingyun] could hardly believe that the girl in front of him, with her dry and messy hair and pale skin, was [Xiao Yuan].
1:33:41|1:33:47|Holding her in his arms, [Zhuge Qingyun] suddenly saw a picture left by the former sect leader.
1:34:3|1:34:4|But later on.
1:34:41|1:34:51|Emerging from his memories, [Zhuge Qingyun] once again saw the withered body of [Xiao Yuan] in his arms, resembling a piece of burnt charcoal. Unable to contain himself, he called out her name.
1:35:19|1:35:26|Xiao Yuan didn't even have time to hug her beloved man again before her strength dissipated like threads of silk.
1:35:38|1:35:56|It was probably the heart-wrenching cry of [Zhuge Qingyun] that woke [Iron Dragonfly] and [Boss] up in a daze. After checking on Xiao Yuan's condition and feeling the surging power within their bodies, the two knew that Xiao Yuan sacrificed herself to save everyone. For a moment, they were all speechless and silent.
1:35:56|1:36:7|After who knows how long, under the summons of [Boss], the brothers gathered in the woods. The bleak cold wind stirred everyone's emotions. After burying [Xiao Yuan] simply, [Iron Dragonfly] spoke up and asked.
1:36:29|1:36:33|After personally placing the stone tablet on the grave, [Boss] slowly spoke.
1:36:46|1:36:56|Saying that, [Zhuge Qingyun] turned to look at [Dao Yichang] standing in the corner. [Boss], as if having planned it all along, gathered his energy in his palm and then charged towards [Dao Yichang].
1:36:56|1:37:1|For reasons unknown, [Dao Yichang] extended his arm and exchanged a palm strike with [Boss].
1:37:1|1:37:8|The two of them seemed to be evenly matched in their skills. After their palms clashed, the rest of the group from the same faction were forced back several steps.
1:37:8|1:37:10|But Boss spoke up.
1:37:29|1:37:42|One by one, the senior brothers walked up to Dao Yichang and each kicked him in various vital points of his body. Knowing it was part of the initiation ceremony, Dao Yichang had been prepared and silently endured it.
1:37:42|1:37:48|After the senior brothers left, Second Brother [Zhuge Qingyun] stepped forward. He first patted [Dao Yichang] on the shoulder, then spoke.
1:37:50|1:37:55|Next, a high whip kick was about to strike directly at [Dao Yichang]'s face, but the force was stopped at the critical moment.
1:37:55|1:37:58|Dao Yichang grinned and expressed his gratitude.
1:37:58|1:38:10|In the final challenge, it was the role of Master Sister, [Iron Dragonfly], who seemed to be upset because the other senior brothers were talking about vulgar matters. When [Dao Yichang] saw that the newcomer was [Iron Dragonfly], he then shouted out.
1:38:13|1:38:21|Upon hearing this, [Iron Dragonfly] did not refuse. He took a few steps back, then with a running start, he flew and kicked [Dao Yichang] in the chest.
1:38:21|1:38:37|With this blow, [Dao Yichang], a seven-foot tall man, actually flew out into the air, not landing until out of everyone's sight, causing his fellow brothers to exclaim in surprise. [Iron Dragonfly] was also puzzled, as his strength, infused by [Xiao Yuan], had become so powerful.
1:38:37|1:38:43|If it weren't for Dao Yichang also possessing Xiao Yuan's supernatural powers in his body, this kick would probably have scattered his soul.
1:38:44|1:38:56|The scene shifts to the outskirts of the city where the two demons are located. The sixth episode of the movie, "The Return of the Shield Armor," officially begins, with Zhuge Qingyun and Iron Dragonfly on opposite sides, discussing the ownership of the Divine Mechanism.
1:38:56|1:39:8|At this moment, two giant stones suddenly appeared in the sky. One was controlled by [Boss] personally, while the other was controlled by [Iron Dragonfly], [Zhuge Qingyun], and [Dao Yichang] together. The giant stones coordinated with each other and smashed towards the White Tiger.
1:39:9|1:39:18|Feeling the fierce killing intent, [Zhuge Qingyun] roared and smashed the huge rock controlled by [Boss], but in this gap, another huge rock fiercely hit [Zhuge Qingyun].
1:39:18|1:39:25|When [Baihu] lifted the giant stone, it was astonishing to find four human figures standing in mid-air, demonstrating the power of the shield armor.
1:39:26|1:39:38|[White Tiger] flew towards [Dao Yichang] in a fit of rage, only to see that [Dao Yichang] was surrounded by almost substantial divine power at this moment. With this power, in less than three moves, he knocked down [White Tiger] and pinned him to the ground.
1:39:38|1:39:47|The four members of Akagi Kenmu and Kagemi are all refreshed, so powerful that they dare not underestimate the enemy, temporarily putting aside their personal grievances with [White Tiger], and rushing towards [Iron Dragonfly].
1:39:47|1:39:54|Seeing this demon attacking so swiftly, [Iron Dragonfly] was first startled, then immediately prepared for battle, engaging in a back-and-forth fight with Chimu in the sky.
1:39:54|1:39:57|Chigeki was taken aback and dared not continue to entangle.
1:39:57|1:40:0|Retreating quickly to [Baihu]'s side after finding a loophole.
1:40:0|1:40:6|At this moment, [Baihu] found it difficult to resist the attacks of the four individuals, so he simply threw the Divine Machine to Chimu.
1:40:6|1:40:10|So, Chimu combined the Divine Machine and the Spirit Pearl into one, becoming the strongest War Mother.
1:40:11|1:40:14|Prepare to launch a full-scale attack to annihilate the four members of the Mist Shadow.
1:40:14|1:40:28|Watching the crumbling earth around them and the sudden strong wind that could even cut through skin, Zhuge Qingyun and his companions finally felt the power of the complete premonition machine. They tightened their hearts secretly, unsure if the four of them could withstand this earth-shattering blow.
1:40:28|1:40:34|Seeing the small ball jetting out from the premonition machine, covered with flesh-colored thorns, [Zhuge Qingyun] quickly shouted at [Iron Dragonfly].
1:40:37|1:40:46|Afterwards, without caring for his own safety, he flew directly in front of [Iron Dragonfly], hoping to use his own body to block this deadly blow for [Iron Dragonfly].
1:40:46|1:41:4|At this moment, as time seemed to stand still, amidst the raging fire, the selfless [Zhuge Qingyun], the panicked [Iron Dragonfly], all came to a halt. On the other side, around the freshly buried grave of [Xiao Yuan], a surge of vitality suddenly emerged, reviving the withered plants and trees nearby.
1:41:4|1:41:6|In the blink of an eye, everything is reborn.
1:41:6|1:41:18|After a moment, a giant peacock monster, shining all over, which is the true form of [Xiao Yuan], soared into the sky from the tomb, laughing and flapping its huge wings, and arrived at the battlefield in an instant.
1:41:18|1:41:37|Following that, using great supernatural powers, Zhuge Qingyun safely transported the five hidden individuals to the ground. He then engaged in a battle with Chimu and Baihu. After their attacks were deflected, Chimu suddenly unleashed his flesh strips, wrapping them around Xiao Yuan, rendering her unable to move. He then prepared to launch the deadly blood-red sphere with the Divine Machine in hand, at that moment.
1:41:37|1:41:55|The White Tiger also flew into the sky, baring its teeth and claws as it charged towards [Xiao Yuan]'s back. At the critical moment, [Xiao Yuan] once again displayed great supernatural powers, causing time and space to freeze. Then Zhou Shen released countless electric lights, breaking free from Chimu's restraints just as those blood-red spheres were about to touch him.
1:41:55|1:42:4|[Xiao Yuan] escaped from the area, but it was the white tiger charging from behind that collided with those small balls, causing a massive explosion that reverberated throughout the entire airspace.
1:42:5|1:42:22|Mixed with flesh and blood exploding in mid-air, the initiator Akagi stood there in disbelief. It was during this moment of mocking the gods that [Xiao Yuan] seized the opportunity, immobilizing Akagi under her feet. Akagi howled in agony as Xiao Yuan carried him into the sky, using all his strength but unable to move.
1:42:22|1:42:25|The first time I felt the fear that penetrated deep into my soul.
1:42:25|1:42:29|He may have never imagined that death would come so close to him.
1:42:29|1:42:36|[Xiao Yuan] adjusted the angle, exerted a little force, and directly threw Chimu into the airspace where the blood-colored small balls were floating.
1:42:36|1:42:41|It was just now that Akagi wanted to eliminate the private person of the hidden object, releasing a deadly weapon.
1:42:41|1:42:46|The huge explosion buried Akagi before he could even feel the moment of contact with the red ball.
1:42:46|1:42:53|In the Heavenly Palace, two huge blood-colored smoke clouds are the last impressions left in this world by two extraterrestrial beings.
1:42:53|1:43:4|After dealing with Chimu and Baihu, [Xiao Yuan] emerged from the thick smoke, now restored to her human form, looking at herself who she had buried with her own hands, now standing in front of her in good shape.
1:43:6|1:43:17|The fierce battle came to a halt, and everyone tightly embraced each other, their hearts filled with excitement and passion. They were not only celebrating the end of calamity for the world, but also feeling emotional about surviving the disaster together and reuniting once again.
1:43:17|1:43:21|The scene shifts to the secret base of the Wuying Gate outside Kaifeng City.
1:43:21|1:43:26|The senior brothers, led by the new sect leader [Xiao Yuan], continue to shoulder the mission of safeguarding the people.
1:43:26|1:43:32|A group of people gathered around the conference table, discussing the mysterious painting "Along the River During the Qingming Festival".
1:43:39|1:43:55|After pasting two scrolls together, a dozen twisted and distorted characters appeared on them.
