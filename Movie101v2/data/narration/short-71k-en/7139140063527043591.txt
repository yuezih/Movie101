0:2:39|0:2:50|Five beams of light shot straight to the top of the sky, and in an instant, five gaps opened in the dense dark clouds, and the light turned into divine power pouring down, shattering the four evil beasts one by one.
0:2:59|0:3:3|The scroll closes, and twinkling stars converge to form the three words [Lang Ming], marking the official start of the film.
0:4:9|0:4:12|Lang Ming accurately knocked down the pursuers with an apple.
0:4:19|0:4:21|He accurately stepped on a lump of stone.
0:4:47|0:4:50|Speak up, a large hand snatched away a candy from a child before it could reach his mouth.
0:5:18|0:5:22|People on the street scattered in an instant.
0:5:57|0:6:5|The sidekick gestured towards the bamboo shoots on the ground, but the boss took them and stuffed them into his own mouth.
0:6:39|0:6:46|Lang Ming fumbled to open a window, slipped in like a wisp of smoke, only to find it was actually a public bathhouse inside.
0:6:46|0:6:51|He fell into the bathtub, spinning uncontrollably, rushing forward and crashing straight ahead.
0:6:51|0:6:57|The screen that was blocking people from bathing was also smashed to pieces by him.
0:7:7|0:7:15|Lang Ming, who ran out, ran into Shanpao for help. He smelled the dangerous scent and quickly mobilized his hearing, sensitively capturing the information around him.
0:7:46|0:7:47|He's already grown so big.
0:8:0|0:8:5|Following his mother, [Lang Ming] swaggered away, and the stunned [Shanpao] stood still after receiving two slaps.
0:8:25|0:8:32|The scene shifts, with a doorplate bearing three characters of Jiugong standing tall amidst the misty mountains and forests.
0:8:32|0:8:49|In Jiugong Ridge, [Tian Jingsha], the leader, is sitting cross-legged under a huge ancient tree, with leaves slowly falling. With eyes closed, [Tian Jingsha] is casting a spell, causing fallen leaves from all directions to converge towards him, spinning rapidly into a large semicircular dome that covers him coldly.
0:8:51|0:9:1|In front of him, darkness turned into a sea of flames in an instant, and a fierce beast with bright crimson eyes appeared in the air, approaching him.
0:9:1|0:9:12|[Tian Jingsha] suddenly opened his eyes, and at that moment, a pair of hands grabbed his shoulders and pulled him out, causing the canopy of leaves to suddenly scatter.
0:9:20|0:9:23|[Tian Jingsha] looked at the fallen leaf in his hand, lost in thought.
0:10:16|0:10:18|The scene changes, revealing a gambling den.
0:10:18|0:10:27|In the midst of choking voices, Mother [Sister Mei] pulled [Lang Ming] into the crowd of clouds.
0:10:27|0:10:31|Lang Ming focuses, listens intently, and captures the movement of the three dice in the dice cup.
0:10:38|0:10:48|Sister Mei placed her bet, the clock was opened, exactly as Lang Ming described. The gambling continued, but Lang Ming was casually eating an apple, leaning on the table, listening nonchalantly.
0:11:0|0:11:4|Lang Ming, who guessed right every time, almost took away all the money.
0:11:4|0:11:7|The seemingly inappropriate boss angrily pressed the button hidden under the table.
0:11:7|0:11:11|In the dark room, the mechanism is activated, and a wooden ball is ejected.
0:11:11|0:11:14|The table shook, altering the original numbers on the dice.
0:11:14|0:11:22|But this little movement was still keenly captured by [Lang Ming].
0:11:31|0:11:33|Sister Mei and Lang Ming were thrown out of the hall.
0:14:11|0:14:15|The kite flew out with Little [Lang Ming].
0:14:27|0:14:28|There was no more news.
0:14:28|0:14:32|Dad's figure gradually disappears, and time goes back to this moment.
0:15:5|0:15:16|The scene shifts to a quiet jungle deep in the forest. The girl, Su Xi, extends her foot and walks forward on the water, her dress following her steps, creating a mysterious light.
0:15:16|0:15:19|She walked to the center, crouched down, and pointed her finger at the water's surface.
0:15:19|0:15:26|In an instant, a powerful force swiftly swept open the calm water surface, revealing the figure of [Jia Ye].
0:15:57|0:16:1|Taking the medicine, [Sister Mei] walked out of the pharmacy without saying a word under the watchful eyes of the shopkeeper.
0:16:9|0:16:23|In the dark night, [Sister Mei] stood in front of the house with a look of melancholy.
0:16:23|0:16:31|Suddenly, a huge beast's foot appeared behind the wall. The scene shifted, under the starry sky, Lang Ming was lying on the eaves, howling like a wolf.
0:16:44|0:16:49|The windmill beside him started to turn, and he sensed something strange.
0:16:49|0:16:57|Immediately, he picked up the cane, leaped up, stepped on the tiles, slid down the eaves agilely, and landed accurately.
0:16:57|0:17:3|He followed the strange voice and rushed out of the village, ready to find out what was going on.
0:17:3|0:17:12|In the hazy night with smoke, the chirping of cicadas and birds never ceased, which [Lang Ming] failed to notice that [Shanpao] and his two accomplices were now sneaking behind him.
0:17:30|0:17:38|Seeing the gloomy scene ahead, the three of them ran away in a hurry, while [Lang Ming] continued to walk deeper into the mountains.
0:17:38|0:17:45|At the same time, under a giant stone canopy, [Su Xi] was at a loss facing the floating Tarot in the magic.
0:17:45|0:17:51|He reached out to grab it, but was fiercely counterattacked by the magic power, and a magic array lit up on the giant stone.
0:17:56|0:18:2|Suddenly, he heard footsteps and quickly hid behind a rock.
0:18:2|0:18:7|In the valley, unusual air currents and the sound of spinning gyroscopes entered Lang Ming's ears amidst the howling of wolves.
0:18:7|0:18:10|He reached out his hand towards the hovering spinning top.
0:18:14|0:18:21|Please note that a huge force swept across the ground, causing the magic array on the giant rock to disappear.
0:18:45|0:18:50|Seeing the valley on the verge of collapse, [Su Xi] leaped in front of the howling wolf with a flying body.
0:18:50|0:18:54|Lang Ming fell to the ground, but managed to use the momentum to quickly get back on his feet.
0:18:54|0:19:0|Suxi launched an attack on [Lang Ming] like lightning, kicking towards his waist, and Tuo Luo Fei fell to the ground.
0:19:1|0:19:18|The rocks trembled again, and taking advantage of Su Xi's distraction, [Lang Ming] quickly picked up the spinning top. However, he was firmly grabbed by the wrist by the opponent, kicked in a vital spot, and then kicked in the air. The spinning top soared up, and as [Lang Ming] jumped to grab it, he unexpectedly missed. Concentrating his mind, he opened his mouth and caught it in the next moment.
0:19:19|0:19:26|Lang Ming was hit by Su Xi from behind and swallowed into his stomach, causing the ground to suddenly crack open, and he fell straight down.
0:19:26|0:19:38|On the other side, in a pitch-black forest, a monstrous creature with a sinister face, sharp fangs, and scales all over its body slowly walks by. It has glowing crimson eyes, panting heavily, emitting a dangerous aura approaching.
0:19:39|0:19:47|The scene shifts to a vast grassland, with the morning light shining in. [Lang Ming], who is in a daze, slowly opens his eyes.
0:19:47|0:19:54|In front of him, a butterfly fluttered across the sky, but almost instinctively, [Lang Ming] covered his eyes with his hands.
0:19:54|0:20:2|He got up, stumbled and groped his way to the edge of a bend in the river. After reaching out and testing the water, he cupped some in his hands and drank it down.
0:20:2|0:20:7|Soon after, it hazily opened its eyes, and two small fish swam away quickly.
0:20:8|0:20:15|In the river, his reflection was clearly visible.
0:20:28|0:20:40|He looked at everything in front of him in disbelief - the jungle, grassland, ancient trees, strange rocks, flowers, and sunlight filtering through the leaves, with little squirrels poking their heads out and scurrying around.
0:21:0|0:21:4|Lang Ming joyfully ran freely on the vast grassland.
0:21:4|0:21:10|He somersaulted, opened his arms, leaped and galloped joyfully, rolling down the hillside.
0:21:10|0:21:18|Four beautiful figures bathing in the mountain spring suddenly appeared before their eyes.
0:21:24|0:21:48|Lang Ming chased after the butterfly, floating on the ground and wriggling with the caterpillar, imitating the frog's water jump, he was so happy.
0:21:48|0:21:51|He suddenly remembered the spinning top he had swallowed.
0:22:6|0:22:21|Arriving at the village entrance, [Lang Ming] covered his eyes and walked inside, but things seemed a bit off.
0:22:27|0:22:34|The schoolyard at Xiaoyanggang is deserted at the moment, in ruins, with dark clouds looming overhead, eerily quiet.
0:22:34|0:22:45|Lang Ming took a few steps forward and felt very confused.
0:22:45|0:22:48|Suddenly, a huge creature appeared behind [Lang Ming].
0:22:56|0:23:6|It turned out to be the monster that appeared in the woods before.
0:23:6|0:23:10|The monster opened its huge mouth towards [Lang Ming], causing him to flee in panic.
0:23:17|0:23:23|The monster chased after him relentlessly, like a wild horse running amok.
0:23:23|0:23:29|Lang Ming kept running for his life while continuously pulling down the goods from the shops along the street to block his pursuers and buy himself some time.
0:23:29|0:23:34|Taking advantage of the monster being tripped by the wine barrel, [Lang Ming] quickly slipped behind a water tank on the side of the street.
0:23:35|0:23:40|The monster didn't notice and continued to chase straight ahead, finally disappearing without a trace.
0:23:40|0:23:44|Lang Ming gasped heavily, leaning against the wall as he ran to the back of the alley.
0:23:44|0:23:48|Just as he sat down, he saw three people with pumpkins on their heads.
0:24:17|0:24:23|As soon as the words fell, the monster named Luo Sha leaped out from behind the three people, the ground tiles flying up, launching a fierce attack.
0:24:23|0:24:33|After a deafening roar, [Lang Ming] soared into the air, leaped over the ferocious head, landed, and then turned to block his path, approaching him step by step.
0:24:36|0:24:47|The demon keeps approaching Lang Ming, who trembles in fear and steps back. Accidentally, he falls to the ground, and the demon leans down, its terrifying face getting closer to his.
0:24:47|0:24:57|In a critical moment, Lang Ming fumbled for a small knife. He picked it up and stabbed Little Demon in the forehead. Little Demon writhed in pain and thrashed around, and a white-tailed figure swept Lang Ming up into the sky.
0:25:7|0:25:24|Welcome to the newly fallen Lang Ming, who was leisurely falling when suddenly a surge of pulse waves rushed in, catching him in mid-air and sliding him forward. Lang Ming felt both curious and pleased. The next moment, a vertically inserted stick appeared, directly hitting the crotch of Lang Ming's split legs.
0:25:47|0:26:7|The man with short hair among the five threw a magic stick to block the path of [Lang Ming], and suddenly a fire rose up around him. Then two phantoms flashed by, only to see the girl with bangs leaping into the air and striking [Lang Ming] with a palm, instantly silencing the surroundings. Meanwhile, the man in a cloak gathered a force of water and ice, rushing towards [Lang Ming].
0:26:7|0:26:19|The girl with a ponytail followed closely behind, transformed into a bright light and leaped into the sky, then transformed into four long-haired [Rakshasas] that plunged straight into the ground, immediately trapping it tightly.
0:26:19|0:26:27|On the side, a burly man extended his palm, and a huge force swept up the tiles and bricks on the ground. With a clenched fist, the tiles and bricks fell down, completely pinning down [Lang Ming].
0:26:48|0:26:53|Zhan Chi showed the palm print to everyone,
0:27:17|0:27:18|Shanpao walked out with assistance.
0:28:9|0:28:16|An object flew towards him and rolled to the ground, it was the Xialan seal he sold to the children.
0:28:39|0:28:44|[Lang Ming] squatted down and quietly picked up the seal under the hostile gaze of the villagers.
0:28:44|0:28:51|Another child glanced at the fake Xia Lan seal in his hand, feeling disappointed and angry, then raised his hand and threw it towards [Lang Ming].
0:28:51|0:28:58|Other children also followed one after another, stamping seals on [Lang Ming]'s body, leaving him feeling guilty and sad.
0:28:58|0:29:4|Trust was betrayed, what seemed like joy turned out to be a scam, leaving the children crying in grievance.
0:29:11|0:29:17|[Qian Jun] hurriedly flew to the pile of tiles to check the situation, but it was already deserted.
0:29:24|0:29:26|Lang Ming is running at full speed.
0:29:26|0:29:30|Finally home, [Lang Ming] looked ahead eagerly, only to see a scene of desolation and ruins.
0:29:51|0:30:1|He walked towards it in disbelief, only to see the collapsed gate, fallen trees, and desolation.
0:30:28|0:30:32|With a loud crash, the only remaining toilet collapsed as soon as the words fell.
0:30:32|0:30:36|A wave of despair hit, and [Lang Ming] fell to his knees on the ground.
0:30:54|0:31:1|Suddenly, dark clouds gathered overhead, thunder roared, and raindrops fell down.
0:31:1|0:31:7|Lang Ming knelt on the bluestone slab, crying out in pain, then suddenly stood up and crawled towards the ruins.
0:31:13|0:31:19|The tile is lifted, and the mother's purse appears in the gap, which is held up by [Lang Ming].
0:31:35|0:31:37|Sister Mei suddenly appears.
0:32:4|0:32:14|Lang Ming and Sister Mei were fighting again, and Lang Ming was quickly subdued by Sister Mei.
0:32:14|0:32:19|[Sister Mei] let go of [Lang Ming], stood up, and hesitated for a moment before speaking.
0:32:28|0:32:31|Lang Jing looked fierce, but the other party completely ignored him.
0:32:32|0:32:37|The scene shifts, with Bi Ting and You Budong walking in the mountains.
0:32:42|0:32:43|Faintly visible.
0:32:54|0:33:0|In the misty surroundings, [Shanpao] arrived in a field.
0:33:18|0:33:25|Suxi grabbed the ankle of Shanpao, who suddenly appeared, and forcefully dragged him backwards, swinging him back and forth in the air.
0:33:25|0:33:39|Two little brothers panicked and fled at the sight, while Lang Ming on the side watched in shock. The scene then shifted to a forest, where Lang Ming was vigorously drilling wood to make fire. When Su Xi handed him a piece of roasted meat, he pretended to be aloof and turned his head away.
0:33:44|0:34:4|Time flies, scenes constantly change and shuttle. The howling of wolves follows Su Xi as they walk through the myriad forests, vast grasslands, bountiful wheat fields, steep suspension bridges, and cliffy rocks. They experience thunder and lightning, rain and clear skies, sudden changes in stars, witness the red sky in the rainy season, the setting sun, and the faint morning light.
0:34:5|0:34:12|And so, with their own different purposes in mind, the two of them continued on their journey, unstoppable.
0:34:12|0:34:24|The scene shifts to the mountains, with clear skies and a gentle breeze. Lang Ming and Little Demon are crossing the river in a boat when suddenly, a crocodile emerges from the water. Lang Ming is startled and frightened, frantically paddling the oars to move forward quickly.
0:34:25|0:34:31|Su Xi jumped up and stood on the back of the crocodile, chasing away Lang Ming with a loud roar.
0:34:31|0:34:41|Lang Ming abandoned the boat, ran all the way, and reached the edge of the cliff. Before catching his breath, he was pushed down by a finger from Susie.
0:34:41|0:34:47|The crocodile at the cliff opens its mouth, Su Xi swings the rope down, loops it around Lang Ming, and hangs him upside down, swaying him up and down.
0:34:53|0:35:0|In the next scene, in the mountains and forests, Lang Ming follows behind Su Xi, clutching his stomach, his face showing pain.
0:35:17|0:35:37|Lang Ming had just left when eerie bird calls sounded all around. A large bird swooped down, but Su Si agilely dodged it. The bird then transformed into a human form, revealing itself to be [You Budong]. [You Budong] landed gracefully, and Su Si hurriedly climbed up the water. However, Bi Ting suddenly appeared and kicked out, causing Su Si to dodge and fall into the water, with [You Budong] following closely behind.
0:35:37|0:35:45|The gas cluster hit him hard against the tree, and just as Lang Ming, who had just finished urinating, turned around, he saw Su Xi lying on the ground.
0:35:52|0:35:58|Many years ago, since Xia Lan sealed the Qiongqi, the world has been free from this evil force for a long time.
0:36:17|0:36:26|Su Xi's pupils suddenly flashed with color, then launched an attack towards Bi Ting.
0:36:26|0:36:35|Bi Ting struck out with a palm towards her back, Su Xi split into two bodies, passed through the flesh, knocked Bi Ting down from Budong, and the body collapsed as well.
0:36:50|0:36:56|Lang Ming looked at his palm, then ran towards [Su Xi] and lifted her up in his arms.
0:37:39|0:37:44|She sat up and pushed [Suxi] aside.
0:38:9|0:38:18|He fumbled around and then slapped [Su Xi] hard across the face.
0:38:18|0:38:24|A colorful light shone in [Su Xi]'s eyes.
0:38:24|0:38:30|He viciously pounced towards [Lang Ming].
0:38:30|0:38:32|Lang Ming used his feet to forcefully press against his face.
0:38:41|0:38:50|Lang Ming exerted force and kicked him out.
0:38:50|0:38:56|Su Xi crazily pounced towards [Lang Ming], but [Lang Ming] swiftly dodged, causing her to fall to the ground.
0:39:16|0:39:17|Su Xi pounced on him again.
0:39:30|0:39:35|No one looks down on him because he is blind.
0:39:35|0:39:41|He lived in a courtyard with a large locust tree, every spring.
0:40:15|0:40:22|Becoming a true Xia Lan, from then on, he took care of justice.
0:40:25|0:40:30|Unknowingly, the day has already dawned, and Lang Ming's storytelling has become dull, almost putting me to sleep.
0:40:30|0:40:35|On the side, Lang Ming finally calmed down and lay quietly on the ground.
0:40:35|0:40:40|The scene shifts, with two people walking in the cave.
0:40:51|0:40:54|Su Xi took a few steps forward and said slowly.
0:41:30|0:41:39|Sure, indeed, there was light shining through the front cave wall. The camera passed through a small opening in the wall and looked down, where a man was leading a group of people bowing towards a body.
0:42:0|0:42:6|Lang Ming bowed his head on the cave wall, which was the head of the guardian god, and the branches supporting him suddenly broke.
0:42:16|0:42:25|In an instant, everyone screamed and scattered, their heads falling heavily, kicking up a cloud of dust.
0:42:25|0:42:31|The people who ran to the side turned back and looked up at Lang Ming and Su Xi, facing each other.
0:42:31|0:42:40|The next moment, the two were tied up tightly, and the villagers whispered and discussed among themselves.
0:42:40|0:42:43|The villagers stopped and glanced at the two before continuing to whisper to each other.
0:42:51|0:42:57|The villagers pointed forward, and on the plaque were three big characters of that village.
0:42:57|0:42:58|Watching the villagers whispering to each other, [Lang Ming] shook his head.
0:43:39|0:43:43|Lang Ming struggles to pull his hand out of the rope.
0:44:5|0:44:7|Lang Ming stood in front of everyone.
0:44:28|0:44:46|It gathered its energy and slapped a nearby big tree with one palm, causing a sudden silence in the whole scene. The villagers stared blankly, and after a few seconds of wolf howling, the tree remained unchanged. In the awkward silence, [Su Xi] shook her head helplessly.
0:44:46|0:44:50|Lang Jing blew a few breaths towards the tree again, but still no response.
0:44:56|0:45:0|The villagers were stunned, and after a moment, they raised their arms and cheered together.
0:45:16|0:45:27|Behind him, the villagers extended a shovel and aimed it at Lang Ming, pushing him down in one fell swoop. The villagers below cheered as they caught him and tossed him high into the air, along with Sister Mei who was also repeatedly thrown into the air.
0:45:57|0:46:0|Amid cheers, the two were carried forward triumphantly.
0:46:4|0:46:10|The scene shifts to a mountain forest, where a suspension bridge appears amidst the swirling mist and clouds.
0:46:10|0:46:15|Chasing the demon, Zhan Chi, Chen Yue, and [Qian Jun], three Xia Lan warriors stand at the bridgehead.
0:46:42|0:46:50|In a mountain spring, villagers put on masks, play music, dance the ritual dance, and scatter flower petals into the air, the sacrifice begins.
0:46:55|0:47:13|The villagers sat cross-legged in a circle, following the music, pointing their fingers at [Lang Ming] and [Little Demon] facing each other in the center of the circle. [Old Village Chief] stood in the middle, holding a long staff.
0:47:13|0:47:21|The two of them looked terrified, looking around, the sky slightly darkening, the bonfire lit, the villagers standing in rows along the mountain ladder, dancing in an orderly manner.
0:47:45|0:47:56|Water is the medium through which we communicate with the gods, placing him in the water and expressing through singing and dancing.
0:48:23|0:48:27|This is the accountant of the village, called [Lang Ming].
0:48:46|0:48:52|The two naked individuals were very embarrassed, with Su Sihuan hugging her arms and showing a look of embarrassment.
0:49:11|0:49:27|As evening fell and the wind howled outside, Su Xi stood alone in the room. Her figure was reflected in the bronze mirror. Suddenly, the mirror shook and emitted a burst of spiritual light. Su Xi reached out her finger and touched it, and the figure of [Jia Ye] appeared in the mirror.
0:50:20|0:50:24|He turned around, facing the cave wall, revealing a sinister smile.
0:50:24|0:50:38|Lightly visible, the cave wall violently shakes, rock layers collapse, and a huge eye suddenly appears, filled with toxic and cruel beauty. Its pupils continuously contract, moving back and forth, scanning the surroundings.
0:50:51|0:50:59|Lang Ming returned to the village, on the hillside at night, leaning weakly against the door of the thatched house with the sound of wolves howling.
0:51:21|0:51:24|He turned around, only to see a hillside outside the house with people lining up.
0:51:48|0:51:49|Lang Ming lay down disappointedly on the grass.
0:51:49|0:51:52|Su Xi picked up the windmill that fell from [Lang Ming].
0:52:18|0:52:20|Su Xi looked at the windmill, lost in memories.
0:53:4|0:53:12|Xiao Susie took out a match and lit the firecrackers stuck in the ground towards [Shanpao] gang.
0:53:14|0:53:18|The flames climbed up the fuse step by step.
0:53:18|0:53:22|[Shanpao] helped the second elder squat on the ground, desperately blowing at the flames with his mouth.
0:53:22|0:53:25|Lang Ming remained motionless, with his eyes closed, listening intently.
0:53:25|0:53:30|At the last moment when it was about to burn out, he leaped and grabbed the firecracker.
0:53:30|0:53:33|In an instant, Shanpao soared into the sky with firecrackers.
0:53:33|0:53:37|After spinning wildly in the sky for a few rounds, he then charged towards Little Susie.
0:53:37|0:53:40|The two embraced each other and flew straight ahead.
0:53:40|0:53:42|After a few spins, they charged towards the sky again.
0:53:43|0:53:50|In the next moment, [Shanpao] explodes, blooming into a firework in Lang Ming's palm, and the scene shifts to Little Lang's home.
0:54:53|0:54:56|Suzi went to seek help from [Old Village Chief].
0:55:9|0:55:10|The old village chief calculated with a pinch of his fingers.
0:55:10|0:55:17|Lang Ming and Little Demon hurriedly crossed over the wolf people lying on the ground and left.
0:55:40|0:55:57|The wooden door opens to reveal a scripture pavilion, with scrolls stacked on high shelves on both sides. The pavilion is entirely made of wood, with a weathered and aged appearance. A finely carved ancient book is placed on the central high platform.
0:55:57|0:56:7|The [Old Village Chief] in this scene dipped his hands into the basin, carefully washing them before taking out a handkerchief to dry them. He then put on gloves and opened the ancient book.
0:56:13|0:56:21|He turned to the first page, Lang Ming and Little Demon peered over from both sides.
0:56:21|0:56:27|He secretly wiped his nose on the first page and threw it behind him.
0:56:27|0:56:29|In the book, there is a little figure that looks like [Old Village Chief].
0:57:5|0:57:8|A hero suddenly appears.
0:57:8|0:57:21|He used a spinning top as a medium to seal that energy into the spinning top, but he sacrificed his own life.
0:57:21|0:57:24|To commemorate the return of this unnamed hero to the village,
0:57:26|0:57:28|He erected his statue.
0:57:31|0:57:32|Lang Ming turned around and looked at Su Xi.
0:57:59|0:58:1|Su Xi silently lowered her head,
0:58:29|0:58:31|Su Xi handed the ancient book to [Lang Ming] and then turned away.
0:58:55|0:59:11|The scene shifts to the hillside of the village, where several villagers are wielding hammers, nails, and saws, building wooden boards and stacking stone walls, busily constructing a small thatched house. They also put up a wooden sign on the house that reads "Reserved Parking for Xia Lan".
0:59:16|0:59:23|In the room at night, Su Xi gets up from the bed and accidentally trips over Lang Ming lying on the floor. The two look at each other in silence.
0:59:35|0:59:47|The air was filled with music as time in the village began to speed up, [Lang Ming]'s belly growing bigger and making movement more difficult.
0:59:47|0:59:52|Suzi, like a surrogate father, began to take on the responsibility of caring for [Lang Ming].
0:59:52|0:59:57|In the flickering fireflies of the night, he lay on the ground, fanning [Lang Ming] to cool down.
0:59:57|1:0:0|In the shade of the trees during the day, he stole sour fruits and fed them to [Lang Ming].
1:0:2|1:0:6|In the scorching courtyard, he guards the small stove, brewing medicine for [Lang Ming].
1:0:6|1:0:11|He guards every sleepless night of Lang Ming and gives the only bed to Lang Ming.
1:0:14|1:0:20|They fetch water in the fields, do yoga with a pregnant woman by the mountain spring, and shuttle back and forth at the market.
1:0:20|1:0:27|They watched the sunrise and sunset together, the mountain sparrows flying in flocks, the tide coming and going, the clouds rolling and dispersing.
1:0:27|1:0:33|Suzie, who was attracted by several beautifully dressed girls, also began to learn how to apply powder bags for [Lang Ming].
1:0:33|1:0:40|At the market, Lang Ming saw Su Xi hesitating to pick up a bell bracelet, and secretly bought it for her.
1:0:46|1:0:55|In the small house at night, moonlight penetrated through the window, sprinkling on the bed, and harmonizing with the candlelight on the table, swaying the beautiful silence of the summer night.
1:0:55|1:1:2|Lang Ming looked at the bracelet in his hand, and at Su Xi sleeping in the shed, a happy smile playing on his lips.
1:1:2|1:1:8|A few fireflies gently brushed across [Su Xi]'s cheeks, illuminating her small face.
1:1:9|1:1:18|Thus, after countless days and nights together, the young man and the young woman, each carrying their own innocent and shy love, carefully concealed their feelings in their hearts.
1:1:35|1:1:37|[Su Xi] supports Lang Ming, the atmosphere is extremely tense.
1:2:12|1:2:14|The two walked onto the stone bridge.
1:2:49|1:2:54|The door of Mao Fang was slowly pushed open, and Lang Ming crawled out with a wolf howl.
1:2:54|1:2:58|[Suxi] rushed over when she saw the situation, helping him sit down on the ground.
1:2:58|1:3:4|He rubbed his stomach and then took out the bracelet, handing it to [Suxi].
1:3:4|1:3:10|In the background, the setting sun painted the sky brilliantly, as if time stood still at that moment.
1:3:27|1:3:33|Suxi hesitated to reach out to Tuoluo, but ended up grabbing the bracelet.
1:3:33|1:3:35|Lang Ming caught up and found that Susie had put on the bracelet.
1:3:45|1:3:57|Suddenly, a loud noise came from the distance. The two hurried to the village, only to find it deserted and devoid of any signs of life.
1:3:57|1:4:3|At this moment, a child walked out of the room crying, and the two of them ran towards him, one in front and one behind.
1:4:12|1:4:19|The Rakshasa roared angrily at Lang Ming, and Su Xi teleported in front of Lang Ming.
1:4:19|1:4:27|Suddenly, a cloud mass rapidly spun down and in the surging mist appeared the figure of [Jia Ye].
1:4:27|1:4:33|The clouds dispersed, and he slowly descended in the swirling dust of falling leaves.
1:4:39|1:4:42|Lang Ming was holding her hand as Su Xie was talking.
1:4:58|1:5:2|Jia Ye sucked the dharma into the palm of his hand, revealing a sinister and cold smile.
1:5:2|1:5:5|The next moment, the demon opened its big mouth behind Lang Ming.
1:5:6|1:5:10|[Jia Ye] went to rescue Lang Ming's Su Xi and brought her back.
1:5:11|1:5:16|[Little Demon] chased after Lang Ming and kept biting him, then a white-tailed creature heavily swung him to the ground.
1:5:17|1:5:27|He struggled to sit up, [Lang Ming] with its sharp fangs wide open, slowly approaching. Suddenly, another [Lang Ming] leaped out from the other side and pounced on the one attacking the Wolf Clan.
1:5:33|1:5:39|[Jia Ye] gathered a ball of energy in his hand and struck fiercely towards the two struggling [Rakshasas].
1:5:39|1:5:44|A massive air mass swept upwards with great force, sucking in the two beasts one after the other.
1:5:49|1:5:58|A bird call came from the sky, a few beams of light flashed across the screen, the Five Heroes descended from the sky, leaped from the roof to the ground, and stood face to face with [Jia Ye].
1:5:58|1:6:11|Zhan Chi, who landed last, saw Jia Ye and was surprised and angry.
1:6:11|1:6:13|The Xia Lan immediately prepared for battle.
1:6:38|1:6:42|Zhan Chi took the lead and led the Xia Lan group towards [Jia Ye].
1:6:42|1:6:54|[Jia Ye] stood still, waved his hand, and a huge spiritual power instantly knocked all the Xia Lan down to the ground, then disappeared with Su Xi in the mist.
1:7:4|1:7:9|Watching the backs of the Xia Lan members leaving, [Lang Ming] stood still in place, feeling as if his heart had turned to cold ashes.
1:7:9|1:7:18|Suddenly, thunder roared in the sky, dark clouds gathered, and a torrential rain poured down fiercely on a demolished roof.
1:7:18|1:7:24|He pounded his head and walked into the scripture pavilion, arriving in front of [Old Village Chief] and the villagers.
1:7:55|1:7:58|Brought disaster to the village.
1:8:24|1:8:27|Even in the face of incredibly powerful enemies,
1:8:35|1:8:42|Looking at the kind gazes of the villagers and the doll of the deity given to him by the child, [Mao Nier] murmured,
1:8:55|1:9:0|He hurriedly left after saying that, and [Old Village Chief] watched his back, muttering to himself.
1:9:4|1:9:26|The scene shifts to the mountains, with [Mao Nier] standing at the peak, facing the faint morning light on the horizon. He closes his eyes, relying on his sense of hearing. In the distant valley, the bell bracelet worn on Susie's wrist jingles with each step, producing a crisp sound that travels across the mountains and reaches Mao Nier's ears.
1:9:26|1:9:30|He had a cloth tied over his eyes, and the world plunged into darkness once again.
1:9:31|1:9:38|In the gloomy cave, Jia Ye took out a spinning top, held it in front of his nose, and sighed deeply, saying intoxicatedly.
1:10:40|1:10:46|Suxi angrily rushed towards him, but was thrown to the ground by a glance from him. He grabbed Suxi's hair.
1:11:15|1:11:21|Speak up, [Jia Ye] left with pride, leaving Su Xi looking at the bracelet on her wrist in pain.
1:11:21|1:11:29|On the other side, the divine bird Haidongqing from Jiugong Ridge sent a message to lead Tian Jingsha and Yi Henxi.
1:11:53|1:11:58|He grabbed Su Xi's neck, his clenched fist hanging in the air.
1:11:58|1:12:3|He released Susie, slowly lowered his fist, and followed her into the depths of the cave.
1:12:3|1:12:9|The space inside was vast, surrounded by sturdy cliffs, with a dangerous atmosphere looming.
1:12:10|1:12:17|A fierce panting was heard, and three demons peeked out from the crevice in the rock wall.
1:12:17|1:12:23|Lang Ming looked up, the stairs spiraling up in the rocks, each level housing several demons.
1:12:39|1:12:44|Lang Ming looked in horror as countless identical demons flashed past him.
1:13:36|1:13:42|In the scene, Sister Mei transforms into a demon, rushes out the door, and Lang Ming, who understands everything, kneels down on the ground in despair.
1:14:35|1:14:46|Suddenly, the crystals hanging from the cave ceiling began to shake and shatter, falling down in pieces as the mountain violently trembled.
1:14:46|1:14:51|[Zhan Chi] roared, broke through the rock wall, burst out of the stone fence, and ran out in a hurry.
1:14:51|1:15:0|Under the sunlight, the upper-level Rakshasas fell one after another, clustering and rolling downwards, instantly disappearing in all directions, with all beasts running wildly, rushing out in all directions.
1:15:7|1:15:24|Mao Nier searched among the beasts, seizing the spine of a Rakshasa and being dragged forward, causing mountains to crumble and the earth to split wherever they passed. As the beasts squeezed into a narrow canyon, Suxi caught up, while Mao Nier continued to cry out in despair amidst the flying dust.
1:15:30|1:15:37|In the midst of chaos, Lang Ming was thrown to the ground, constantly dodging the beasts that were running past him.
1:15:37|1:15:45|Suddenly, he looked up and saw a tree trunk horizontally inserted in the canyon. He then leaped up and tightly hugged the tree trunk.
1:15:46|1:15:55|Looking up, the setting sun was like snow, on the vast and boundless plain, the demons were charging forward like the wind, rushing into a huge pit ahead one after another.
1:15:55|1:16:2|In an instant, countless demons fell into the deep clouds, all of which were seen by [Tian Jingsha] in the Nine Palace Spirit.
1:16:2|1:16:7|[Tian Jingsha] flew over the mountains and forests, transformed into human form, and delivered the message to [Bi Ting].
1:16:7|1:16:11|At the same time, [Bi Ting] was leading the group of heroes to rush towards Lan.
1:16:23|1:16:27|At this moment, a Rakshasa that had already run to the edge of the giant pit suddenly stopped.
1:16:27|1:16:30|He turned slowly and looked towards [Lang Ming].
1:16:30|1:16:35|Beside him, the demons were still galloping, with yellow sand filling the sky and dust flying.
1:16:38|1:16:42|On the other side, [Lang Ming] is running towards his mother, struggling forward in the midst of the beasts.
1:16:50|1:16:56|The awakened mother, running against the relentless herd of beasts, ran towards [Lang Ming].
1:16:56|1:17:2|The small figure was repeatedly engulfed in the rolling smoke and dust, knocked down by the herd time and time again.
1:17:8|1:17:13|At the moment of being hit and falling into the pit, he firmly clung to the edge of the pit, struggling to support himself and climb back up.
1:17:13|1:17:20|Suddenly, he used all his strength to grab the ground, leaped up, and fiercely pounced towards [Lang Ming].
1:17:20|1:17:23|But who would have known, they ran into a Rakshasa leaping forward.
1:17:23|1:17:31|The mother, unable to resist, disappeared into the bottomless pit, leaving [Lang Ming] crying out in despair.
1:17:35|1:17:39|Lang Ming, who wanted to jump off the cliff, was tightly embraced by Little Demon.
1:17:39|1:17:54|He tried to break free, but ultimately, under immense sorrow and anger, he lost his strength and sat paralyzed on the ground.
1:17:54|1:17:56|At this moment, [Jia Ye] suddenly appeared.
1:18:13|1:18:21|He turned around, and [Tian Jingsha] was standing right behind him, with other [Xialan] appearing one after another.
1:19:5|1:19:9|The air suddenly quieted down, and the Little Demon did not arrive as expected.
1:19:9|1:19:16|[Jia Ye] stood awkwardly in place as the [Lang Ming] and others regained their senses, with a command issued by [Tian Jingsha].
1:19:16|1:19:21|The Xia Lan rushed up swiftly and launched attacks on Jia Ye one by one in a fleeting and shadowy manner.
1:19:21|1:19:36|[Jia Ye] stood in place, continuously leaping and spinning, throwing punches while dodging the attacks from [Xia Lan], kicking him in the air, then striking out with three bursts of energy, which rushed towards [Jia Ye], causing the ground to collapse and flames to rise.
1:19:36|1:19:49|In the next moment, [Jia Ye] rose from the fireworks, soared into the air, a huge surge of demonic energy rushed out, fiercely smashing towards the ground, and in an instant, the [Lang Ming]s fell to the ground one after another.
1:19:49|1:19:59|[Jia Ye] floated in the air, slowly descending. Suddenly, a huge boulder fell from above, crushing him. [Tian Jingsha] and the other two leaders [Xia Lan] rushed towards the top and assumed a defensive formation.
1:20:0|1:20:8|The valiant Lang Ming flew into the formation, just as Jia Ye broke through the top, a bright light rushed down.
1:20:8|1:20:14|He stretched out his hand to resist with all his might, but was ultimately knocked down to the ground. In an instant, the ground shattered, and the divine stone splattered.
1:20:14|1:20:20|The Xia Lan team descended from the sky, and as the dust settled, the mountain suddenly began to shake violently.
1:20:29|1:20:33|In the scene, a burst of mountain fire erupts, causing the ground to collapse.
1:20:33|1:20:38|In the shaking mountains and trembling caves, rocks are flying, the wind is howling, and yellow sand fills the sky.
1:20:38|1:20:41|The Xia Lan group was shaken to the ground, unable to stand.
1:20:51|1:20:53|In the sky, a giant palm emerges from the flames.
1:21:4|1:21:19|The giant palm pressed down, grabbing the mountains, amidst billowing smoke and shattered mountains. The ferocious face of the demon emerged from the flames, as the earth continued to tremble and crack. Rocks kept sliding down the tilted mountains, while the fierce wind swept the debris into the air.
1:21:30|1:21:34|Su Xi wielded her knife to stab Jia Ye, but he activated his spiritual power and turned to stab Lang Ming.
1:21:38|1:21:57|Lang Ming fought desperately against the looming blade, he was forced to the ground by Su Xi, while at the same time, Jia Ye had already broken through the mountain. He roared to the sky, and in an instant, countless fireballs surged out, swiftly flying over the mountains and smashing towards the village. As the flames soared into the sky, people scattered and fled.
1:21:57|1:22:6|Suddenly, a fireball shot towards a child, and [Chen Yue] arrived just in time to block it as it fell, while [Qian Jun] produced a weapon to intercept the fireball.
1:22:7|1:22:19|Zhan Chi manipulates the formation to shatter the falling rocks, while on the other side, Jia Ye is still controlling Susie.
1:22:19|1:22:23|Susie swung down, and Lang Ming felt a darkness before his eyes.
1:22:23|1:22:31|After a brief silence, he opened his eyes, a few drops of blood falling on his waist, while the dagger was now stuck in Susie's chest.
1:23:26|1:23:29|The screen shows the Xia Lan fighting hard to protect the people.
1:24:0|1:24:17|The bell bracelet fell along with Susie's hand, as she lay in Lang Ming's arms, losing her breath.
1:24:17|1:24:21|Susie's body turned into glowing dots and floated into the air.
1:24:21|1:24:25|Behind them, the raging fire of gluttony has not ceased, sweeping through houses, leaving the world in ruins.
1:24:28|1:24:37|Lang Ming trembled as he picked up the fallen bell bracelet from the ground, overwhelming sadness enveloping him. He knelt on the ground, crying uncontrollably.
1:24:37|1:24:42|He then tightly closed his eyes, angrily tilted his head up, tears freely streaming down his cheeks.
1:24:52|1:24:55|On the other side, [Jia Ye] sat up and sarcastically exclaimed in surprise.
1:25:1|1:25:7|Facing Jia Ye, Mao Nier stood up shakily, but then collapsed unable to support herself.
1:25:22|1:25:32|He rushed over and punched [Jia Ye] in the face, one punch after another.
1:25:32|1:25:39|Gradually, he lost his strength, tears welled up in his eyes and flowed out.
1:25:39|1:25:45|The surrounding rocks and mountains began to crumble, causing [Mao Nier] to be knocked down by falling rocks.
1:25:45|1:25:49|After a moment, he struggled to get up, picked up the dagger on the ground, and stood at the edge of the huge pit.
1:25:55|1:26:0|He tilted his head back, raised the dagger, and slashed his own eyes, letting blood flow freely from them.
1:26:21|1:26:29|Above the sky, a fireball soars, with [Mao Nier] standing at the edge of the void. Slowly spreading his arms, he leaps down and plunges into the billowing smoke and dust.
1:26:50|1:27:10|A powerful force instantly filled his entire body, following him as he fell, roaring out like a gust of wind. The swirling mist was continuously pierced through, and at that moment, the windmill also suddenly dropped, lifted by the wind, hovering in the air. With a loud bang, Mao Nier fell heavily to the ground, kicking up dust and causing the tiles to shatter.
1:27:10|1:27:14|He fell into a coma, and beside him, the bell bracelet slowly rolled out and fell to the ground.
1:27:15|1:27:37|At the same time, [Tao Tie] was still rampaging in the mortal world, his fireballs piercing through the mountains and forests, constantly crashing towards the village. Wherever he went, there were ruins and scorched earth, with flames reaching the sky and corpses scattered all over. People screamed in panic and fled, while [Tian Jingsha] stood in the crowd, determined to fight to the death.
1:27:45|1:27:56|The Xia Lan team emitted a bright light, shooting upwards, piercing through the mud and dispersing it, forming a huge barrier that covered the sky, as the Gluttonous Hound fiercely smashed towards the barrier.
1:28:1|1:28:11|The Xia Lan team kept exerting force, holding on tightly, bridging the gap in the barrier that had been smashed open, but the voracious power instantly caused the barrier to rupture again.
1:28:11|1:28:14|The surrounding people looked at all this, confused and desperate.
1:28:21|1:28:31|[Tao Tie] clenched his fist and smashed towards the barrier again. The Xia Lan were unable to resist anymore, being knocked down by the immense force. In an instant, the barrier shattered and collapsed.
1:28:34|1:28:43|The Taotie looked down, coldly despising all beings, and the wolf howled windmill spun past, turning into ashes in an instant as it approached the Taotie.
1:28:43|1:28:53|At the same time, the gluttonous giant palm, wrapped in billowing smoke, slowly descended towards the crowd. On the devastated land, the flames reflected the despair on people's faces.
1:28:54|1:29:4|Tears and fear have lost their voices at this moment, everyone has given up struggling, holding their loved ones tightly, closing their eyes, waiting quietly for the arrival of death.
1:29:10|1:29:30|With a loud bang, Lang Ming's palm struck a suddenly appearing light prism. In an instant, Lang Ming's palm shattered, and he angrily spewed out flames. However, the light prism remained indestructible, unmoved, as sand and stones flew around. Lang Ming was lifted by a force, suspended above the ground, continuously rising upwards.
1:29:32|1:29:40|People looked up, in the midst of swirling clouds and mist, the wolf howled and stood in front of [Tao Tie], [Shanpao] was surprised by the presence of the leader.
1:29:55|1:30:10|The child looked at the faint imprint on the seal in his palm, he reached out his hand towards the sky, and the children followed suit vigorously. [Shanpao] helped the leader to look at his empty palm, but also struggled to reach out to the empty space.
1:30:10|1:30:15|As time passed, the people firmly extended their palms, determined to fight side by side with the Wolf Tribe.
1:30:17|1:30:27|Watching the provocateur in front of him, [Chen Yue] angrily opened his mouth wide, throwing out numerous fireballs flying towards Lang Ming. Lang Ming dodged agilely while flying straight towards [Chen Yue].
1:30:45|1:30:52|Amidst the billowing black smoke, Lang Ming rides the wind with a wolf's howl, swiftly circling around [Chen Yue] from bottom to top.
1:30:52|1:30:57|In an instant, [Chen Yue] was enveloped by layers of black smoke, with flames and electric lights flashing together.
1:30:57|1:31:1|In the next moment, a beam of light shot out from the black smoke, soaring into the sky.
1:31:1|1:31:5|Chen Yue's body, then split into pieces and collapsed with a bang.
1:31:5|1:31:10|At that moment, a strong wind rose, yellow sand filled the sky, and everyone was amazed.
1:31:12|1:31:33|Shortly after, Lang Ming reached out and held the Tarot in his palm. The Tarot floated up and stood on the dome, spinning rapidly. In a moment, with spiritual light surrounding it, only to see electric light and black smoke carrying the scattered body of the glutton, in an instant, being swept up and sucked in. On the other side, the mountain began to collapse, and Jia Ye, who was unconscious on the ground, suddenly opened his eyes.
1:31:33|1:31:53|It was already too late to dodge, as the giant rock fell instantly, burying it deep in the ruins and smoke. The black smoke rolled with electric light and fierce fire. In the air, the gluttonous corpse was still being continuously rolled in by the gyro. The previously eaten snails were now falling one after another, as if poured onto the ground, all rolling down the mountain.
1:31:53|1:31:58|A spiral fork soared into the air, instantly gathering and dispersing scales and flesh, transforming into a human form.
1:31:58|1:32:4|At that moment, with a grand momentum and a rush of vitality, people didn't know what was happening and fled in fear.
1:32:7|1:32:21|After the half-flash, the world finally quieted down. The slaughter furnace fell to the ground, spinning a few times before lying still. [Tian Jingsha] stepped forward, picked it up, and the heroes and villagers followed behind.
1:32:21|1:32:30|At this moment, Lang Ming has disappeared without a trace, the sky is calm, like the clearing after rain, the clouds gathering and dispersing, only a few clouds peacefully floating in the sky.
1:32:35|1:32:51|Three months later, on the lush plain, Lang Ming is guiding Shanpao and a few children to control the wind kite for flight, while Old Village Chief is hanging on the kite.
1:32:51|1:32:53|Suddenly, the kite string broke.
1:33:5|1:33:6|At this moment.
1:33:10|1:33:12|Sister Mei slapped him hard.
1:33:31|1:33:33|On the other side, the villagers of that village are repairing the statue of the deity.
1:34:1|1:34:8|Time flies, three months have passed. [Lang Ming] stands at the edge of the cliff, holding a bell bracelet, standing silently.
1:34:8|1:34:11|Suddenly, he put away the bracelet.
1:34:34|1:34:39|This spinning top that seals the gluttonous spirit used to belong to him.
1:34:42|1:34:49|The question for the Jiugongling Xia Lan exam is to use your own vitality to make this spinning top spin.
1:34:59|1:35:2|Spin the top rapidly.
1:35:4|1:35:8|That is the transcendent element beyond the five elements - wind.
1:35:21|1:35:26|In the Nine Palaces Tomb, he smiled as he prepared to leave, then suddenly he stopped in his tracks.
1:35:48|1:36:3|The scene returns to this moment, with [Tian Jingsha] looking at the spinning top in his hand, then gazing at the departing figure of Lang Ming, just like he once watched the departing figure of Lang Ming's father, so firm and brave, shining brightly in the enveloping sunset.
1:36:4|1:36:7|The film ends here, thank you for listening.
1:36:7|1:36:10|At the end of the film, a post-credits scene will be shown.
1:36:44|1:36:49|Now let's talk about the post-credits scene.
1:36:49|1:36:54|In the bustling market on campus, [Lang Ming] is leisurely strolling with a dog.
1:36:54|1:36:57|Suddenly, a familiar voice came from ahead.
1:37:7|1:37:9|[Chen Yue] hurriedly ran towards the crowd.
1:37:12|1:37:16|She grabbed the girl's arm, but was pushed away by the other party.
1:37:38|1:37:48|The girl shook her head helplessly and walked away. She brushed past [Lang Jing]'s arm, the bell bracelet jingling. After a few steps, she stopped, turned around, and spoke.
