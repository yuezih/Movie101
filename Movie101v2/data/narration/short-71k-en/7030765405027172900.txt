0:0:56|0:1:15|A middle-aged man rushed into the amusement park in a panic, followed closely by the short-haired policewoman [Mi Nan]. Ignoring the obstruction, the man dashed into the carousel, with policewoman [Mi Nan] following suit. The man grabbed a little girl from the carousel with one hand, while the girl held up a fruit knife with the other hand.
0:1:24|0:1:33|Uncle waved a fruit knife wildly, and Yang rushed forward to subdue him, trying to arrest him by taking out handcuffs. However, just as he handcuffed his right hand, the uncle pushed [Mi Nan] to the ground with force and took the opportunity to jump out of the fence and escape.
0:1:37|0:1:57|Mi Nan climbed up and chased after Milan with all his strength. The uncle crossed the crowd and rushed towards the control room at the edge of the amusement park, pushing the staff aside with a hand, then turned and ran towards the giant Ferris wheel. He climbed up along the pole in the middle, followed closely by [Mi Nan]. The Ferris wheel was still turning at an extremely slow speed, and the two climbed higher and higher, reaching the position of the central pivot in no time.
0:1:57|0:2:7|At this moment, a staff member suddenly got up from the ground, rushed into the control room, pressed the switch, and stopped the Ferris wheel from turning. The uncle changed direction and climbed outward, with [Mi Nan] following without hesitation.
0:2:7|0:2:16|Under the Ferris wheel, the tourists holding up their phones to take pictures were all looking up at the two figures standing dozens of meters high in the air, and they let out bursts of exclamation.
0:2:20|0:2:37|[Mi Nan] slipped under her feet, hurriedly squatting down to grab the railing. The old man, watching the female police officer getting closer and closer to him, was completely panicked. He was so focused on trying to stop her from approaching that he forgot to pay attention to his own movements. Without realizing it, his feet stepped into the air and he fell down. In a panic, he quickly raised his hands to grab the railing above his head to prevent his body from falling.
0:2:37|0:2:45|[Mi Nan] saw this and lunged forward, grabbing the handcuffs hanging on the uncle's right wrist and securing them to the nearby railing, finally breathing a sigh of relief.
0:2:46|0:2:50|Uncle Fang Mu let out a scream as he hung in mid-air, and the scene froze at that moment.
0:2:50|0:3:9|The following shot stretches the entire amusement park with a metallic sheen, concluding the opening story. The main feature is about to begin, as the film is about to kick off with a series of serial murder cases, where all the victims were tortured to death. All clues point to the criminal psychology genius detective [Fang Mu].
0:3:9|0:3:22|While investigating a case with her colleague [Mi Nan], [Fang Mu] discovers that her high school classmate [Jiang Ya] seems to be hiding many secrets. At the same time, a user named "City of Light" appears online, initiating a vote to determine the life or death of the lawyer Ren Chuan.
0:3:22|0:3:29|[Fang Mu], [Mi Nan] and other police officers tried every means, but still couldn't stop this dark trial of violence begetting violence.
0:3:31|0:3:56|At a critical moment, the nanny realizes that Wei Wei, the wife of [Jiang Ya], is a key witness to unlocking [Jiang Ya]'s secret. Just as the truth is about to be revealed, a shocking incident suddenly occurs. The brilliant detective [Fang Mu], played by Deng Chao, the policewoman [Mi Nan], played by Liu Shishi, the high school classmate [Jiang Ya], played by Ruan Jingtian, [Jiang Ya]'s wife Wei Wei, played by Lin Jiaxin, and the lawyer Ren Chuan, played by Guo Jingfei.
0:3:56|0:4:0|Next, let me tell you about the main part of the movie.
0:4:0|0:4:22|Under the cover of night, the campus appeared somewhat eerie, with scattered teaching buildings and only a few windows lit up. The scene then moved into an empty classroom, where a man sat on a chair in front of the blackboard, leaning forward, unconscious on the desk. His limbs were chained to the desk and chair, which were also chained together and fixed in place.
0:4:22|0:4:33|He propped himself up from the desk, grimacing as he raised his bound right hand to rub the back of his head. In a daze, he realized he was tied up with iron chains to the seat.
0:4:40|0:4:54|Night lights on both sides of the classroom flickered with the man's shouting, as if he was startled, or heard some noise. He stared blankly ahead, through his cracked glasses, and could see a figure in black with a hat pushing open the door and walking in.
0:5:13|0:5:19|The man in black walked behind Fang Mu and beat him up, then forcefully stabbed a pen into Fang Mu's wrist.
0:5:38|0:5:57|The man's glasses fell to the ground, so he could only squint his eyes to do the questions. After the man finished speaking, he left without looking back, and the screen gradually darkened, then it cut to the next day.
0:6:4|0:6:21|At the beginning of the film, the female police officer [Mi Nan] who is chasing the middle-aged uncle, Fang Mu, is sitting in the police station office. Instead of speaking, Yang Xuewu takes out a business card and hands it to him. The owner of the business card is named [Fang Mu].
0:6:38|0:6:54|[Mi Nan] happened to arrive at the criminal psychology research room where [Fang Mu] was located. He knocked on the door and walked in directly. The person being hypnotized, who turned out to be a murderer, was lying on the couch.
0:7:34|0:7:45|The murderer struggled on the bench, [Fang Mu] walked to the corner and pulled back the curtain, behind which sat several police officers. [Mi Nan] stood outside the research room, looking at everything through the one-way glass.
0:8:10|0:8:27|[Fang Mu] said while taking off his white coat that the murderer was furious, but [Mi Nan] looked very happy watching through the glass.
0:9:28|0:9:36|余光 [Yu Guang] dressed in school uniform, hands covering face, body leaning back, jumped out of the window.
0:10:0|0:10:9|[Mi Nan] stopped speaking, [Fang Mu] looked at him with a puzzled expression, then stood up from the vine and said,
0:10:18|0:10:31|He shook his coat while speaking. [Mi Nan] rolled his eyes helplessly, [Fang Mu] suddenly turned to look at him. He quickly forced a smile, extended his right hand trying to shake hands with [Fang Mu] to say goodbye.
0:10:40|0:11:2|[Fang Mu] finished speaking and walked away. [Mi Nan] shook her hand and could only leave. As she went downstairs to the south, she called and complained about [Fang Mu]. Fang Mu suddenly stopped and called out to her just as she was about to leave, then turned back to answer him.
0:11:30|0:11:51|[Mi Nan] danced around while analyzing the case, with all the police officers gathered around listening to him. He proudly pointed at the suspect in the photo and waved his hand. Then, [Yang Xuewu] team leader spoke up and asked a question. [Mi Nan] was caught off guard by the question, but didn't want to show any weakness. He took a deep breath and answered.
0:11:57|0:12:4|The police officers surrounding them burst into laughter and dispersed. [Liao Yafan] awkwardly lowered his head, turned around, and pushed away the portable whiteboard with the suspect's photo on it.
0:12:21|0:12:28|You now listen to the program playing on the TV in the small restaurant at night. A little girl is lying on the table doing her homework, and after a while, she notices that the little dog by her feet is missing.
0:13:17|0:13:44|She turned her head and happened to see a puppy drinking water by a puddle, the water was a bit murky and new drops kept falling from above. The girl squatted next to the puppy, looking up at a leather container hanging from the ceiling. She slowly stood up and stared at the container, a dark shadow suddenly flashed from it, resembling a human face. The girl was instantly frightened, sitting on the ground and crying loudly.
0:13:44|0:14:5|The next morning, [Yang Xuewu] team arrived at the place where the little girl was scared last night with Minnan, several police officers, and four people in white protective suits. They inserted a thick pipe into a leather container, poured the liquid inside into an empty bucket through the pipe, and after most of the liquid was poured out, the leather container was taken off and placed on the ground, allowing the remaining liquid to flow out smoothly.
0:14:5|0:14:28|A naked male body was revealed, with his hands and feet tied with ropes, elbows and knees bound together, lying on his side in a fetal position in a container. [Mi Nan] frowned as she looked at the pale yellowish body, quickly covering her nose with her hand. People in protective suits beside her began to examine the body, taking photos as the camera slowly panned up.
0:14:28|0:14:33|Heavy fog enveloped [Mi Nan], who then arrived at [Fang Mu]'s house. He held up a tablet and showed the news to [Fang Mu], who was cooking.
0:15:10|0:15:18|[Fang Mu] placed the pot on the scene investigation and analysis report, [Mi Nan] immediately became anxious. While tasting the soup in the pot, [Fang Mu] asked
0:15:29|0:15:36|The pot on the stove sizzled, and when I rushed over to lift the lid, the soup had indeed burnt. Just then, a little girl walked in and forgot to turn off the stove.
0:15:44|0:16:7|[Mi Nan] widened her eyes in surprise, while [Fang Mu] hurriedly explained that they had gone to register for marriage back then. The girl held onto [Fang Mu]'s arm and glared at [Mi Nan]. [Fang Mu] felt a bit embarrassed, not knowing how to explain. [Mi Nan] looked at them in astonishment, then smiled, turned around, picked up a finger-length piece of scallion, scooped it up with a ladle, and put it into the gourd pot, covering it with a lid.
0:16:10|0:16:21|[Mi Nan] then sarcastically pulled out the report from the bottom of the pot, waved to [Fang Mu] and the girl, and then turned around and left without any hesitation.
0:16:22|0:16:36|The girl suddenly raised [Fang Mu]'s hand and bit it fiercely, then left the kitchen. As night fell, [Mi Nan] returned to the police station.
0:16:56|0:17:23|He placed the chopsticks on the bowl and muttered to himself, "That kid really got messed up." Suddenly, a male body immersed in liquid flashed on the screen. The rain outside was getting heavier, with lightning and thunder in the sky. [Mi Nan] left the police station alone and arrived at the alley where the man was found. He carried a black backpack, wore a transparent raincoat, looked around while walking forward, and after a few quick steps, he entered the abandoned building.
0:17:23|0:17:44|He walked slowly in the darkness with a flashlight, the building was old and empty, with large characters on the wall indicating demolition. [Mi Nan] shone the flashlight around as he climbed the stairs, revealing the exposed wires of the old security door and the faded electrical box on the wall. It was obvious that no one had lived here for a long time, the building was deserted, and [Mi Nan] walked forward while searching for something.
0:17:45|0:17:55|[Mi Nan] heard a noise and suddenly turned around, but found nothing. He continued walking forward, and just as he reached the corner, he saw a dripping umbrella lying on the ground.
0:17:55|0:18:7|Mi Nan was about to walk back when he was grabbed by someone, his right hand pressed against the wall. Startled, he realized the man in front of him was actually [Fang Mu]. Fang Mu then inserted a flower into the door frame and spoke.
0:18:24|0:18:29|[Fang Mu] looked serious, Mi Nan glanced at him and had to shine the flashlight down.
0:18:36|0:18:43|[Fang Mu] suddenly stood up, washed his hands with the rain leaking in from the rooftop, and then lit a cigarette to take a puff.
0:19:35|0:19:56|Hearing the dog barking, [Mi Nan] quickly turned off the flashlight, while [Fang Mu] took a cigarette out of his mouth, extinguished it and threw it on the ground. He gestured for Mi Nan to go downstairs, then picked up an umbrella hanging on the railing and followed down. A man in a black raincoat, holding a flashlight, was walking up the steps. [Fang Mu] and [Mi Nan] hid in an abandoned house.
0:20:6|0:20:9|[Fang Mu] muttered to himself while looking out through the window beside him.
0:20:10|0:20:18|The man in black who is going upstairs suddenly crouches down and pulls out a gun from his waist.
0:20:18|0:20:39|[Mi Nan] shook his head, [Fang Mu] looked somewhat desperate. The man in black held a gun and approached them. [Fang Mu] hid around the corner, holding his breath, glanced at [Mi Nan] beside him, then focused on the man in black. As he heard the footsteps getting closer, [Fang Mu] raised the umbrella in his hand and rushed out. He was about to attack the man in black with the umbrella when he saw the gun pointed at him, and the man shouted.
0:20:40|0:20:47|[Fang Mu] and [Mi Nan] stood still, only to see the man in black panting and taking off the hat on his head. Surprisingly, the man turned out to be [Yang Xuewu].
0:20:48|0:20:54|Hearing Minnan's reminder, [Yang Xuewu] quickly lifted his foot, but unfortunately the suspect's footprints had already been trampled by him.
0:21:12|0:21:17|[Fang Mu] gave Yang Xuewu a sidelong glance, then reached out and flicked his head several times.
0:21:51|0:22:14|Fang Mu's expression was ambiguous, Yang Xuewu chuckled and said the car was speeding ahead. Fang Mu quickly arrived home, and as soon as he entered, he saw the girl who wanted to be his daughter-in-law leaning in front of the fish tank, looking at the fish. The girl took her hand out of the fish tank, turned her head and asked with a tilted head.
0:22:34|0:22:47|[Fang Mu] turned around helplessly and took a few steps forward, then turned back and pointed at the girl, saying that she had watched too many messy TV dramas. Meanwhile, [Mi Nan] sat in the car and asked Captain Yang where that little girl came from.
0:22:47|0:22:55|[Yang Xuewu] fell silent for a moment, glanced back at [Mi Nan], sighed, and then replied, "You know about the case of raping a young girl a few years ago, right?"
0:23:36|0:23:44|The scene then cuts back to [Fang Mu]'s home.
0:23:54|0:24:8|The girl, [Liao Yafan], was lying on top of the fish tank, staring at [Fang Mu] with her eyes fixed, because you helped me kill that scum. [Fang Mu] squatted in front of the fish tank, suddenly raised his head to look at [Liao Yafan].
0:24:33|0:24:58|[Yang Xuewu]'s face was filled with anger and regret. As the rain poured down harder, the car sped quickly across the Red Star Road overpass. The camera then switched to a greasy man wearing a towel on his head, laughing foolishly at the sexy woman on the computer. Suddenly, the room went dark. He glanced at his phone, the time showing 3:12. The greasy man then walked out of the house to open the electrical box, intending to flip the switch back on. But a hand suddenly reached out from behind and covered his mouth.
0:24:58|0:25:12|After a moment, the greasy man bound with plastic tape regained consciousness and lay on the ground on his side. A man in black clothes, his face obscured, was pouring liquid onto the floor and curtains. The man in black pulled back the curtains and said, "
0:26:1|0:26:8|Greasy man Wu Zhaoguang lies on the ground, tears in his eyes.
0:26:13|0:26:21|The man in black stood up and lit the curtains soaked in liquid, then placed a bunch of keys on the coffee table before walking out of Wu Zhaoguang's house and casually closing the security door.
0:26:43|0:26:55|The crowd downstairs was packed with onlookers, the fire truck arrived but was blocked outside the door, while the greasy man Wu Zhaoguang upstairs was rolling and howling in the raging fire.
0:28:29|0:28:39|A man posting on the computer suddenly flashes on the screen. He is wearing a checkered shirt, with medium-length short hair, and a clean right hand holding a mouse browsing something.
0:28:39|0:28:59|After the meeting, Team [Yang Xuewu] brought [Fang Mu] to an underground warehouse where a burnt-out greasy man's unlicensed white Jinbei van was parked. [Fang Mu] opened the car door, sat in the driver's seat with white gloves on, gripping the steering wheel. He imagined the movements of the criminal in his mind, leaning forward over the steering wheel. His left arm accidentally touched the switch for the headlights, and the lights came on.
0:29:0|0:29:24|Then he raised his hand to turn it off, repeated the action several times, and [Fang Mu]'s originally lifeless eyes suddenly lit up. He abruptly got up, opened the car door, got out, and walked to the front of the car. Tilting his head, he stared at the wall illuminated by the car, stretched out his arm and gestured in front of the wall. After glancing back at the car lights, he walked over and squatted in front of the car light, reaching out to touch the dust on it. Then he turned his head to look at [Yang Xuewu] team next to him. It turned out that there were four not very obvious numbers written on the car light.
0:29:26|0:29:45|Following, [Fang Mu] and [Yang Xuewu] team arrived at the classroom where the teacher Wei Mingjun's body was found in the campus corporal punishment case. [Fang Mu] walked to the platform and looked at the four large blackboards behind it, then knelt on the ground to observe the chair fixed with iron chains and the thick iron chains resembling a baby's forearm, with rust at the end. [Yang Xuewu] team immediately leaned over to look at the iron chain.
0:29:48|0:30:8|After a while, [Fang Mu] walked down from the podium and sat in the center of the second row. He focused on the four large blackboards not far away, covered with densely packed formulas. He extracted a few numbers and letters from them, which were 8425 and cxj. Just as he was contemplating, [Yang Xuewu] suddenly walked over.
0:30:12|0:30:27|On the day of the incident, in the afternoon, [Fang Mu] suddenly raised his hand to interrupt what [Yang Xuewu] was saying. He then stood up abruptly and walked towards the blackboard. He picked up a pen and quickly circled some numbers on the blackboard, while switching the positions of the blackboard up and down. [Yang Xuewu] did not stop him, but instead raised a camera to record. [Fang Mu] then stopped his actions.
0:30:27|0:30:44|Turning to look at Team [Yang Xuewu], then turning back to the blackboard, a string of characters was integrated together, xcxj09718425. As expected, there was also a string of numbers in the container holding the bodies in the abandoned building. After the investigation, [Fang Mu] and Team [Yang Xuewu] returned to the staircase meeting room at the police station.
0:30:50|0:30:58|The characters written in the abandoned building container just happen to be this string of characters.
0:31:13|0:31:19|[Yang Xuewu] was a bit dumbfounded, and [Mi Nan] sitting on the side also stood up in surprise.
0:31:40|0:31:52|In the city, everyone is paying attention to this post, expressing various opinions, but the vast majority of people believe that the lawyer should be punished.
0:32:49|0:32:54|[Fang Mu] glanced at the police officers sitting in the conference room, then chuckled as he looked at the lawyer on the screen.
0:33:11|0:33:20|Director Liu answered the phone, then opened the blinds and saw the lawyer downstairs causing a scene, dressed to the nines.
0:33:23|0:33:34|Incheon was then taken into the police station's meeting room. Fang Mu pushed the door open and Director Liu stood up and left. Incheon sat on a chair with a hesitant expression, eagerly looking at Fang Mu.
0:34:37|0:34:48|[Fang Mu] took off his glasses and wiped them. After wiping them, he put them back on. When he saw the other party not responding, he picked up the bottle and took another sip.
0:34:53|0:34:59|Fang Mu stood up and watched Fang Mu's back as she left, looking somewhat dazed.
0:35:7|0:35:17|[Fang Mu] was a little stunned after hearing it, then suddenly came to his senses and raised his hand to catch the gun that the chief ran over with. [Mi Nan] sat aside, took a deep breath, and then set off to carry out the mission.
0:35:17|0:35:31|Shortly after, [Mi Nan] arrived at the Ya Yuan Hotel in Incheon where she lived. From outside the main gate to the corridors, there were criminal police officers in uniform everywhere. [Yang Xuewu] took out his police badge and gestured to the officers at the door to let them in.
0:35:54|0:36:4|After seeing Fang Mu off, Jiang Ya returned to the room to grab her coat. Suddenly, Ren Chuan stood up from the ground and tightly grabbed Fang Mu's hand.
0:36:29|0:36:56|[Fang Mu] turned and left the room after speaking, Incheon stood in the bedroom for a long time without moving. Later, [Fang Mu] came to the car repair shop to meet the first old classmate he hadn't seen for a long time. The chief and other police officers were waiting at the hotel for news. [Fang Mu] then went to the seafood market, and without saying a word, he splashed water at the old classmate.
0:37:5|0:37:34|Shortly after, [Fang Mu] came alone to a pedestrian street. He sat at a round table by the roadside as if waiting for someone. After a while, a man wearing sunglasses got out of a luxury car and rushed towards [Fang Mu], hugging him tightly. After catching up with the third old classmate, [Fang Mu] set off again. As the sky darkened and the street lights came on, he drove alone to Xinhai, No. 20 Yangliuqing Road in the city.
0:37:36|0:37:56|Former classmate [Jiang Ya] lived here. He walked up to the rolling shutter door and knocked, but no one answered. The camera then turned to the inside of the house, where a person was standing in front of the bathtub playing with goldfish. Upon hearing the sound from the door, [Fang Mu] suddenly lifted the rolling shutter door, revealing a girl wearing a duckbill cap inside. Surprisingly, this girl was [Liao Yafan].
0:37:56|0:38:1|Yafan quickly lowered his head to dodge Fang Mu in front of him.
0:38:11|0:38:17|And then I saw [Liao Yafan] roll his eyes at [Fang Mu], and he continued to lower his head to fiddle with the fish tank. [Fang Mu] looked around and asked.
0:38:24|0:38:48|In a not-so-small room filled with fish tanks of various sizes, fish of different shapes swim around. Various landscapes are neatly arranged on the shelves by the wall. Fang Mu took a few steps forward and shouted loudly. Fang Mu looked up at the Sleeping Beauty on the second floor, rolled her eyes silently, and walked upstairs.
0:38:48|0:38:56|A chubby boy rushed out holding a jellyfish, but Fang Mu knocked the jellyfish to the ground.
0:39:4|0:39:10|[Fang Mu] glanced at the bracelet on Er Bao's wrist, then answered the phone. His expression changed instantly.
0:39:19|0:39:38|The police all ran out from the inside, leaving only [Yang Xuewu] to continue squatting in the front. Incheon heard the movement and quickly got up from the bed to walk to the window to look outside. Almost all the police managed to leave in their cars. [Mi Nan] showed the scene to [Fang Mu], who was driving and turned to look at the phone held by Yafan.
0:40:37|0:40:56|Mrs. Hu stood in the dilapidated bungalow, pleading for help from Director Liu outside through the small iron window. Not far from the window, two police officers in protective suits stood by a large earthen jar against the wall, carefully cutting a wire inside the jar. They then took out several bottles tied together with liquid and placed them in a large iron barrel. [Mi Nan] continued to focus intently on filming with her phone.
0:41:35|0:41:45|The City of Light once again launched a vote on the forum, and the number of viewers in the forum has reached over 50 million.
0:41:58|0:42:24|Yafan stared at [Fang Mu] with determination, while obediently holding onto the handle next to the car window. [Fang Mu] immediately shifted gears and drove towards the destination at the fastest speed. As the night grew darker, the city was brightly lit. Students in the dormitory, young people on the streets going to work, delivery riders on bikes, middle-aged people eating at roadside eateries, taxi drivers, girls working out, and even elderly men with reading glasses were all present.
0:42:24|0:42:35|They all voted on the City of Light post on their phones, where the center featured lawyer [Incheon] bound with explosives and imprisoned in an empty house, with his criminal history listed beside him.
0:42:46|0:42:56|[Fang Mu] reached out and touched Yafan's head over the hat, then got off the car alone and headed towards the alley next to the garbage dump. Yafan sat in the passenger seat, watching [Fang Mu]'s back, with a hint of worry on his face.
0:42:56|0:43:23|[Fang Mu] held a flashlight in his left hand and a gun in his right hand, quickly searching for the lawyer [Incheon] and the criminal City of Light. Many police officers followed closely behind, all armed and wearing helmets, with some holding shields. Yafan, who was locked in the car, felt scared and anxious watching the scene. The police then set up a cordon at the alley entrance, with many people gathering around with their phones to watch. [Fang Mu] and [Yang Xuewu] teams rushed into one house after another.
0:43:27|0:43:32|Search, the room was filled with local residents, and [Mi Nan] followed by a group of police officers rushed into a warehouse, accidentally busting a gang selling fake oil.
0:43:32|0:43:38|After a while, [Fang Mu] arrived outside a dilapidated cottage, where he faintly heard something. He climbed over the wooden planks and burst in through the door, finding [Ren Chuan] tied to a chair with a bomb strapped to his chest.
0:44:12|0:44:37|At this moment, Team [Yang Xuewu] also arrived with people. The other police officers rushed to evacuate the crowd. [Fang Mu] saw [Mi Nan] suddenly appear and hurriedly pushed him away. [Mi Nan] pushed [Fang Mu] aside and wrote a line on the small blackboard, showing it to the City of Light to stop.
0:44:37|0:44:54|The blackboard reads that if you consider yourself representing justice, then don't involve innocent people. The City Light on the other end of the screen sees this and hesitates with the bracelet on the keyboard, then presses the space bar. The bomb on Ne Incheon suddenly stops flashing, and [Fang Mu] squats down to look at him and asks.
0:45:4|0:45:14|While Fang Mu was asking questions, City of Light posted a message in the forum. Just as the network lagged, the game became addictive for two minutes, and then the bomb on the chest started flashing again, making the atmosphere tense once more.
0:45:16|0:45:41|In the dormitory, a group of young boys surrounded a tablet, looking at the multiple-choice questions on the screen. Without hesitation, they selected the option to blow it up, with a nonchalant smile on their faces, as if it were just a game. The police mobilized helicopters and fire trucks, while officers at the scene were desperately speeding up the evacuation of the crowd. The number of people voting on the forum was rapidly increasing, with over 98,000 people already choosing to blow up [Incheon].
0:46:17|0:46:32|At this moment, more and more people are participating in the vote, with less than 400 people away from reaching 100,000. Outside the alley, many residents are being urgently evacuated under the lead of the police. Inside the small house, the lawyer [Incheon] stares wide-eyed, holding his breath, seemingly waiting for the arrival of death.
0:46:32|0:46:39|At the moment when the number of people reached 100,000, the criminal [City Light] at the other end of the screen decisively pressed the button on the keyboard.
0:46:39|0:46:47|The bomb strapped to [Fang Mu]'s body was detonated instantly under the remote control of the enemy. The small house where [Fang Mu] was located turned into ashes in an instant.
0:46:49|0:47:5|The nearby houses were also blown to pieces, with pots and pans flying everywhere inside the house, and the tricycle and street lamp outside the house were knocked down and deformed. Just a short distance from the small house that was just blown up, Yang Xuewu, Mi Nan, and Fang Mu were also blown away by the shockwave of the bomb. Even the crowd outside the alley holding up their phones to watch the excitement was knocked over by the oncoming shockwave.
0:47:5|0:47:28|In the originally silent night, the baby elephant suddenly turned into a sea of fire. The horrific scene was transmitted to the police command room through surveillance cameras. All the police officers stood up, and the room fell silent. Soon, the rescue team arrived at the scene. Several helicopters hovered at low altitude, while the rescue team members in protective suits with searchlights on their heads ran forward, searching for survivors.
0:47:28|0:47:46|The once dilapidated alley is now almost completely flattened. As far as the eye can see, dust and smoke fill the air, flames are everywhere. [Fang Mu] struggles to get up from the ruins with all his strength. His expression is one of terror, his clothes are dirty and messy, blood stains on his face and at the corners of his mouth, his ears ringing, his mind in a daze.
0:47:46|0:48:0|He stood in the ruins and looked around, walking aimlessly forward. A firefighter came over and waved at his eyes, saying something, but [Fang Mu] showed no response, his eyes empty. The firefighter continued walking ahead.
0:48:0|0:48:9|Seeing the rescue team members not far away searching in the ruins with shovels, Fang Mu suddenly heard a sound in his ears, and then he suddenly came to his senses and shouted loudly,
0:48:22|0:48:37|[Fang Mu]'s face, covered in dust and bloodstains, was filled with anxiety. He seemed unsteady, his legs trembling. Seeing the firefighters searching under the wood and stone, he suddenly realized something. He ran a few steps, forcefully lifted a nearby door panel, and there was [Mi Nan].
0:48:50|0:49:11|Two firefighters ran over to help rescue [Mi Nan] from under the wooden planks. At the same time, [Yang Xuewu], covered in soot, was also supported by two firefighters and walked out. After a while, [Fang Mu] walked out of the alley in a daze, found his car, opened the door, and sat inside. Seeing the dirty and exhausted [Fang Mu], [Liao Yafan] couldn't help but burst into tears.
0:49:11|0:49:21|[Fang Mu] gasped for breath as he took out the key from his pocket, trying to unlock the handcuffs for [Liao Yafan]. However, his trembling hands couldn't seem to find the keyhole.
0:49:21|0:49:29|[Liao Yafan] couldn't bear it anymore, reached out and took the key, unlocked the handcuffs for herself, tearfully looked at [Fang Mu], then hugged the other person tightly and burst into tears.
0:49:29|0:49:38|[Fang Mu] calmed down his lifeless eyes, soothingly touching [Liao Yafan]'s neck, and the thrilling night quickly passed.
0:49:38|0:49:55|The next day, as the sky brightened and darkened again, in the fish shop where [Fang Mu] had visited the night before, a young man stood in front of a half-height trash can, silently burning page after page torn from a book. Suddenly, he reached out and retrieved one page, gazing at the half-burned paper for a long time before leaving the room.
0:49:55|0:50:0|In the living room, [Er Bao] sat alone on the small bed, eating potato chips with food crumbs around the corners of his mouth.
0:50:0|0:50:21|He looked at the young man walking out of the adjacent room with no change in expression on his face. The young man came over and sat on the bed, gently taking the left hand of [Er Bao], whose middle finger and ring finger were severely deformed and fused together. Fang Mu raised his head to look at the person in front of him, [Jiang Ya], without any surprise. The true identity of the young man was finally revealed - he was Fang Mu's old classmate, Jiang Ya.
0:50:22|0:50:38|The two looked at each other for a long time. [Jiang Ya] then smiled and gestured for him to come in. As [Jiang Ya] turned and walked into the room, [Fang Mu] blinked at his back and followed him in. [Jiang Ya] took a few quick steps and arrived in front of [Er Bao] to coax him to sleep.
0:50:45|0:51:20|[Er Bao] obediently lay on the bed, [Jiang Ya] then called for [Fang Mu] to come upstairs where a woman was lying on the bed, next to a ventilator. [Fang Mu] awkwardly sat on the sofa as [Jiang Ya] handed him a glass of water. [Jiang Ya] explained while walking towards the bed, pointing to a tumor on his head that needed surgery.
0:51:45|0:51:53|[Fang Mu] glanced uncomfortably down at the building below.
0:52:0|0:52:9|[Fang Mu] took a sip from the cup, and [Jiang Ya] sat down at the corner of the bed after massaging his wife's back.
0:52:22|0:52:39|I had to drag everyone along as a transfer student, [Fang Mu] awkwardly smiled, that's not me, while [Jiang Ya] massaged his wife's feet.
0:53:17|0:53:49|[Jiang Ya] put his wife's feet back in place, carefully tucked her in, then stared into [Fang Mu]'s eyes and replied, "That's not you. You shouldn't be an ordinary man." Suddenly, [Jiang Ya] stood up and looked down at [Fang Mu].
0:54:1|0:54:25|Wearing a police uniform, the somewhat naive [Fang Mu] flashes by in the scene. [Jiang Ya] walks over to [Fang Mu] without saying a word, but turns his head to look at him. As soon as it gets light, the police officers arrive at the previously bombed alley to collect evidence. They scatter around the ruins searching. The area has already been cordoned off. Before long, [Fang Mu] walks over in a wrinkled outfit.
0:54:25|0:54:37|He stopped in front of a thick pillar tied with a bunch of flowers, sighed silently, and looked around with his hands on his hips. Suddenly, [Mi Nan] ran over holding an irregular board.
0:54:44|0:54:58|[Mi Nan] handed the fragments to [Fang Mu]. Looking at the palm print on the fragments, [Fang Mu] thought of Er Bao. He remembered that both of Er Bao's hands were deformed, which matched perfectly with the palm print on the fragments. He then rushed into [Jiang Ya]'s fish shop with the police in a mess. [Fang Mu] asked the shop assistant.
0:55:7|0:55:24|Don't move, I'll be right back. [Jiang Ya] was at the hospital paying the bill with the twins, and when she turned around, she saw [Fang Mu] being taken away by the police. The twins ran towards [Fang Mu], who had a scary expression on his face with bandaged hands. [Fang Mu], [Fang Mu], pushed the twins towards [Mi Nan].
0:55:56|0:56:11|[Fang Mu] pushed [Jiang Ya] to the window and said fiercely, "The police leave the hospital and return to [Jiang Ya]'s fish shop." [Fang Mu] sat upstairs, lost in thought, while [Mi Nan] and others searched on the first floor. They carefully observed with flashlights, but still found nothing.
0:56:23|0:56:29|Mi Nan nodded and turned to go downstairs, Fang Mu turned his head and looked at Jiang Ya's wife in front of him, wondering what she was thinking.
0:57:4|0:57:17|Director Liu said expressionlessly, Fang Mu was momentarily at a loss for words, unsure of how to refute. After the meeting, Fang Mu came alone to the interrogation room, pulled down the blinds, and sat across from Jiang Ya, staring at him.
0:57:19|0:57:35|Jiang Ya calmly picked up a disposable paper cup and took a sip of water, while Fang Mu stared at him without blinking, then took out a recorder from his pocket, raised it, turned it off in front of Jiang Ya, and threw it on the table.
0:58:54|0:59:28|[Fang Mu] responded with a sound, leaning back on the chair. [Jiang Ya] shook her body, hands on the table, slightly raised her head with medium-length hair covering half of her eyes. The scene suddenly flashed back to a rainy day many years ago, a man in black knocked Li Yi off the car and beat him to death with a stick. [Jiang Ya] hid nearby and witnessed this scene. [Jiang Ya] deliberately lowered her voice and mysteriously said to [Fang Mu].
0:59:28|0:59:44|As soon as the words fell, he straightened up again and took a sip of water from the paper cup, [Fang Mu] sat opposite, looking somewhat strange. [Fang Mu] then returned to the office and handed over the gun and police badge. Director Liu looked at him, before he could speak, he saw the other person had already turned and left. Beside him, [Yang Xuewu] was a bit stunned, staring blankly. [Jiang Ya]
0:59:56|1:0:5|He walked up to [Liao Yafan], put his hand on his shoulder and said to him.
1:0:36|1:0:42|[Fang Mu] reached out and touched [Liao Yafan]'s head, then withdrew his hand to touch his own nose before turning around and walking away.
1:0:43|1:1:8|He walked down the stairs alone, just as he stepped out of the unit door, he froze in place. He saw [Mi Nan] carrying a shoulder bag, standing next to a small car waiting for him for a long time. "No matter what you investigate, I'll go with you. If you need a witness, at least two police officers must be present," [Fang Mu] looked at the serious [Mi Nan], touched his head, and slowly smiled. [Mi Nan] also smiled.
1:1:30|1:1:43|[Fang Mu] embarked on the journey with [Mi Nan], they drove on a seemingly endless road, as the sky darkened and heavy rain started to fall. They parked the car at a gas station and sat by the convenience store window, preparing instant noodles.
1:1:45|1:2:8|[Fang Mu] took a sip of the soda in his hand, pondered for a moment, and slowly replied, "It's really [Mi Nan]." [Mi Nan] turned to look at [Fang Mu] and nodded affirmatively. [Fang Mu] looked at the earnest [Mi Nan] and they both unconsciously picked up their sodas for a sip. [Mi Nan] took a deep breath and spoke again.
1:2:51|1:2:59|[Mi Nan] turned to look at [Fang Mu], who smiled helplessly.
1:3:30|1:4:10|He pointed his right hand at [Mi Nan], and [Mi Nan] suddenly leaned in and said with a hint of arrogance. She looked up at [Fang Mu]'s eyes, while [Fang Mu] tilted his head slightly, smiling as he met her gaze. A different kind of emotion slowly echoed between them. A big truck with its headlights on slowly approached, helping to shift the awkward topic. Glancing at [Fang Mu] who was busy eating noodles, he quietly left the window, walked behind [Fang Mu], and suddenly felt a surge of childlike innocence.
1:4:10|1:4:32|He reached out and hit the shadow of [Fang Mu]. Suddenly, [Fang Mu] turned around, almost catching [Mi Nan]. He saw [Fang Mu] turn his head and start playing again, sometimes touching the shadow's head, sometimes turning his head to lean against his own shadow. The shadows of the two people coming together looked very harmonious.
1:4:32|1:4:44|However, the mood was ruined when [Fang Mu] once again turned his head to urge [Mi Nan] to eat noodles. [Mi Nan] snapped at [Fang Mu], then turned his back on him and leaned his shadow towards him again.
1:4:44|1:4:50|[Fang Mu] turned around and continued eating, completely unaware of [Jiang Ya]'s actions.
1:4:50|1:5:9|The wind chimes at the fish shop rang as [Jiang Ya] returned home. He stepped over the broken pieces of the fish tank on the floor and walked into the house. The former female shop assistant greeted him, and [Jiang Ya] looked up at the upstairs. The female shop assistant spoke again.
1:5:17|1:5:26|The female shop assistant hurriedly expressed her gratitude and thanks, then ran outside. [Jiang Ya] glanced at him, then walked to the door and forcefully closed the rolling shutter door.
1:5:28|1:5:49|After the torrential rain, a new day dawned. [Mi Nan] woke up from the big bed in the hotel, squinted at the time, and saw that the clock's hands were pointing to 8:15. Upon seeing the time, she instantly became alert, quickly got up, dressed, and went to knock on the door of the next room where [Fang Mu] was staying. However, there was no response from the other side for a long time.
1:6:45|1:7:15|The village elder brought [Fang Mu] to the old house of [Jiang Ya]. [Fang Mu] stood in front of the door and observed the large lock on it. Seeing that the lock was not locked and there was no one around, after finishing the observation, [Fang Mu] pried open the lock and pushed the door open. He walked in with a flashlight, observing the simple furnishings inside the house, which only consisted of a few scattered tables and chairs and some basic daily necessities.
1:7:15|1:7:25|The room seems to have been uninhabited for a long time, covered with dust everywhere, looking dirty. The wires are exposed outside the wall, showing no signs of maintenance.
1:7:25|1:7:33|He held up a camera and took a bunch of photos in the weeds in the corner of the wall, then picked up a spray bottle and started spraying around the room.
1:7:33|1:7:52|After spraying the entire room, he turned around and closed the door. He looked inside for a moment, then a confident smile appeared on his face. The areas where he had just sprayed the liquid all showed chemical reactions, emitting a cold light. The events that had once taken place in this room were once again presented on the screen.
1:7:52|1:8:10|A young boy was slapped hard by a middle-aged man, then kicked, causing him to hit his head on the wall leaving a bloodstain. The boy was quickly thrown to the ground by the middle-aged man, then had his head pressed against a wooden table, leaving a bloodstain on the table as well.
1:8:10|1:8:27|The man then lifted a large axe and swung it towards the boy, who desperately dodged. Unable to bear it any longer, the boy picked up a knife from the ground and stabbed towards the man. The man's waist was pierced by the young assassin, causing his massive body to fall to the side, knocking over bottles and cans on the table along with several paint buckets.
1:8:27|1:8:47|The youth then lifted the axe that had fallen to the ground with a fierce expression, raised it high, and heavily chopped down towards the man on the ground. Part of the spraying blood splattered on the wall, part mixed with the spilled paint, and finally the youth used all his strength to drag the man's body into the house. The scene then returned to reality.
1:8:47|1:9:5|The fluorescent glow in the room revealed the bloodstains under the effect of the medicine. Following the trail of fluorescence, [Fang Mu] eventually discovered a covered cellar in the corner of the house. He walked over and lifted the lid of the cellar.
1:9:7|1:9:26|The smell in the cellar, which had not been opened for many years, must have been unbearable. [Fang Mu] walked into the cellar with a flashlight. After a few steps, he found explosives in a box by the wall. He held the explosives in his hand for a few seconds, then put them back in place, and shone the flashlight around elsewhere.
1:9:26|1:9:33|He seemed to have discovered something? Frowning, he took a few steps forward slowly, and there was actually a human skeleton in the cellar.
1:9:33|1:9:50|[Fang Mu] shone the flashlight on the skeleton, carefully examining it. Finally, he touched the scapula of the skeleton with his left hand wearing disposable gloves. He observed the human skeleton carefully, muttering to himself as he thought, "..."
1:10:17|1:10:26|The sudden ringing startled [Fang Mu].
1:10:53|1:11:15|[Fang Mu] left the old house and sped away in his car. The rural road was muddy and his car was splattered with mud as other vehicles passed by. Just as [Fang Mu] was anxiously driving, another car suddenly appeared and blocked his way. After overtaking the car, [Fang Mu] quickly returned to the inn. He barged into [Mi Nan]'s room, only to find it empty.
1:11:17|1:11:32|[Fang Mu] angrily scolded the shaking waiter, then turned and ran outside. When he reached the stairs, he accidentally bumped into [Yang Xuewu] who was rushing over. He then lifted Yang's hand to check the time.
1:13:25|1:13:40|He looked at the body of [Liao Yafan] in confusion, then glanced at his colleagues around him. Finally, he silently lay down on [Liao Yafan]'s body. Unexpectedly, [Jiang Ya] suddenly appeared. He walked in from above the bridge, wiping the sweat off his neck with a handkerchief in his left hand. Then, leaning on the railing of the second-floor corridor with both hands, he shouted at [Fang Mu].
1:13:41|1:14:5|Hearing someone calling her name, [Fang Mu] slowly climbed up from Yafan's body, looked around in confusion, then turned to where the voice came from. There, backlit on the second floor, stood [Jiang Ya] with a nonchalant smile on her face. [Jiang Ya] spoke about turning herself in, gazing at [Fang Mu] for a moment before slowly releasing the railing with both hands, stepping back, leaving the bridge tunnel, and stepping into the sunlight, raising both hands slowly in a surrendering gesture.
1:14:5|1:14:25|[Fang Mu] stared at [Jiang Ya] as he stood up from the ground, ignoring the mud on his legs. He turned around, opened [Mi Nan]'s coat, took out a gun from his waist, and ran backwards. He swiftly crossed over the iron railing, punched towards [Jiang Ya], knocking him to the ground. With his right hand holding the gun, [Fang Mu] aimed it at his temple.
1:14:25|1:14:31|Meanwhile, almost all the police downstairs pointed their guns at Fang Mu, Yang Xuewu, and Mi Nan, while Jiang Ya hurried forward to stop them.
1:14:46|1:14:54|[Fang Mu] loaded the gun while shouting.
1:15:15|1:15:22|[Fang Mu] clenched his teeth, his facial muscles trembling with anger, while [Jiang Ya] showed no fear on his face.
1:15:33|1:15:56|[Fang Mu] angrily fired several shots into the sky, then sat weakly on the ground. [Mi Nan] and Director Liu both breathed a sigh of relief. [Jiang Ya] didn't speak, just lay on the ground laughing hysterically. He struggled to sit up against the iron railing, eyes fixed on [Fang Mu], who was on the opposite side, crying with a mournful face lost in her own world.
1:15:56|1:16:2|[Jiang Ya] was taken away by several police officers without moving a muscle.
1:16:2|1:16:11|Once the police car left with its siren blaring, [Fang Mu] was left alone. He sat alone by the overpass, his hands hanging weakly on his legs, exuding an air of desolation.
1:16:12|1:16:33|He sat there in silence, from dusk till night, as time passed by minute by minute. The street lights gradually lit up, and [Jiang Ya] was soon brought to the police station. He sat alone in the interrogation room, looking around calmly, seemingly not nervous at all. All his actions were displayed on the big screen in the police station's conference room through surveillance cameras.
1:16:38|1:16:51|After a while, [Fang Mu] and [Yang Xuewu] walked into the interrogation room, with [Fang Mu] holding a laptop and sitting across from [Jiang Ya]. [Yang Xuewu] placed a card on the table and a recording pen in between them. Seeing this, [Jiang Ya] chuckled.
1:17:4|1:17:30|[Jiang Ya] said nothing, just grinned as [Fang Mu] operated the computer for a few moments before turning the screen towards [Jiang Ya]. Soon, [Jiang Ya]'s smile froze on his face as he saw his pale but very alert wife [Jiang Ya] leaning forward, her eyes getting closer and closer to the screen. He watched in astonishment as his wife on the screen opened her mouth in surprise.
1:18:10|1:18:18|[Jiang Ya]'s wife recalls some scenes from the past.
1:18:55|1:19:5|[Jiang Ya] turned his head to look at the second baby beside him.
1:19:13|1:19:22|[Jiang Ya]'s wife feels scared every time she hears her husband's words, perhaps it is fear that has completely awakened him.
1:19:27|1:19:37|[Jiang Ya] sat there crying without saying a word.
1:19:54|1:20:2|[Fang Mu] shouted loudly, as the words spoken by [Jiang Ya] became sharper and sharper. On the other end of the screen, [Jiang Ya]'s wife looked somewhat reluctant.
1:21:21|1:21:30|[Jiang Ya] seemed to calm down from the madness, while [Fang Mu] remained silent and moved his eyes.
1:21:46|1:21:54|Everyone watched quietly as [Jiang Ya] went crazy.
1:22:21|1:22:42|[Jiang Ya] was crying while questioning [Fang Mu] with an excited tone, his hands even trembling. [Fang Mu] remained silent, just looking at him.
1:23:49|1:24:0|[Jiang Ya] suddenly changed his mind, the interrogation came to an abrupt end. He seemed convinced that no one could touch him. [Yang Xuewu] returned to the office and was furious. He picked up a baton and said angrily,
1:24:4|1:24:14|He was about to go to the interrogation room to find [Jiang Ya], when Director Liu walked in and all the police officers in the office stood up in unison.
1:24:38|1:24:50|The jammed iron gate was opened, and [Jiang Ya] in prison uniform swaggered out of the room. A smug smile appeared on his face, as if he was planning something again.
1:24:50|1:24:52|Fang Mu returned home to find no light in the house.
1:24:52|1:25:3|Liao Yafan's black and white memorial photo hung in the center of the living room. Fang Mu squatted in front of Yafan's favorite fish tank, while Mi Nan stood in front, pulling the curtains open with force, allowing sunlight to instantly shine in.
1:25:9|1:25:15|After saying that, he took a few steps forward, squatted in front of [Fang Mu], raised his head and spoke to him again.
1:25:29|1:25:38|[Mi Nan] shouted at [Fang Mu], who seemed to be immersed in his own world.
1:25:53|1:25:59|Mi Nan suddenly stood up and held Fang Mu's face, saying
1:26:4|1:26:22|Don't get yourself involved in this, [Fang Mu] raised an eyebrow, repeating these two words in a questioning tone. [Mi Nan] didn't say anything, but instead put down her hands, took out an everlasting flower from her pocket, and placed it in the other person's palm. The two stood facing each other in silence for a long time.
1:26:22|1:26:35|As dusk approached, [Jiang Ya] came alone to an abandoned building, where she called [Fang Mu].
1:26:46|1:27:3|He stood alone on the rooftop, holding the phone, lifted his leg and kicked a stone off the building. The stone fell from the rooftop and shattered on the ground. Unexpectedly, on the other end of the phone, [Fang Mu] swallowed hard and remained silent.
1:27:8|1:27:27|[Jiang Ya] walked towards the edge of the roof while talking, stepping tightly on a small area with both feet, almost hanging in the air. [Fang Mu] took a deep breath, hesitated for a moment, and then spoke into the phone.
1:27:39|1:27:46|[Jiang Ya] looked a bit strange as she listened to [Fang Mu]'s words. [Fang Mu] spoke again with an extremely slow pace.
1:28:28|1:28:37|Fang Mu suddenly started laughing,
1:28:44|1:29:22|[Jiang Ya]'s little trick was easily exposed by [Fang Mu], as he listened to [Fang Mu]'s voice, his expression became more and more serious. After [Fang Mu] finished laughing, he spoke again and the call ended. Both ends of the phone call hung up simultaneously. [Fang Mu]'s expression became more and more determined, while a sense of unwillingness appeared on [Jiang Ya]'s face. As a new day dawned, the [Yang Xuewu] team was blocked on the road in their car.
1:29:27|1:29:32|Frightened, we heard some noise, [Yang Xuewu] team wanted to drive forward to chase, but accidentally hit another car.
1:29:41|1:29:46|The car owner persisted and even threw away the police badge of the sheep team.
1:30:3|1:30:34|This farce was spread on the internet by passersby, and countless people who were afraid of chaos began to make a fuss. [Jiang Ya] also saw this scene online. He looked at the calls for City of Light online, just raised his hand to touch his hair, and [Fang Mu], who was sitting alone at home, also saw the relevant posts on the forum. The title above was "Car crash and assault, chief of criminal police showing off on the street." [Fang Mu] scrolled through the comments below.
1:30:34|1:30:53|Someone left a message saying we need the light of the city, the light of the city is our king of the jungle. He looked through these absurd messages, picked up a lit cigarette and took a puff. After a while, he tidied up and dressed himself, took out a camera, turned it on and aimed it at himself. Then he bent down and sat on the sofa, smiling as he recorded a video. A moment later, [Fang Mu] made an appointment to meet with [Yang Xuewu] outside.
1:30:55|1:31:4|He set off to the Carving Time Cafe, where Team Yang Xuewu had been waiting at a table for a long time. The cafe was already full of people, with Team Yang Xuewu looking at his phone while waiting for Fang Mu to arrive.
1:31:5|1:31:12|[Fang Mu] pushed the door open and sat down opposite the [Yang Xuewu] team, the waiter approached to inquire.
1:31:34|1:31:41|After speaking, he looked around and then relaxed, leaning back in his chair and unbuttoning his jacket. A handgun was strapped to his belt.
1:31:49|1:32:3|[Yang Xuewu] tapped the table with his finger, remained silent for a few seconds, then spoke up in response to Fang Mu's question. Instead of speaking, [Yang Xuewu] just smiled silently. Fang Mu didn't pause for too long before speaking again.
1:32:6|1:32:26|He looked at the smiling [Yang Xuewu] and raised his eyebrows. The smile on [Yang Xuewu]'s face froze, the smile in his eyes gradually disappeared, and the scene flashed back to the rainy night many years ago. The man in a hooded raincoat who beat up Li Yi was [Yang Xuewu]. The scene returned to reality, [Yang Xuewu] forced a smile and looked at [Fang Mu].
1:32:44|1:33:4|[Jiang Ya] was also present. The rainy night scene unfolded again. After [Yang Xuewu] finished beating someone, he turned and left. [Jiang Ya], who was originally standing not far away, emerged from the corner and squatted beside the dying Li Yi. She reached out and touched Li Yi's bloodied face, then put her blood-stained fingers into her mouth and sucked on them, laughing maniacally.
1:33:12|1:33:19|The waiter put down the coffee and left, [Fang Mu] continued.
1:34:25|1:34:48|[Fang Mu] did not answer his question, but changed the subject. After speaking, [Fang Mu] casually picked up the coffee and took a sip. [Yang Xuewu] was stunned for a moment, looked around cautiously, then quietly pulled out a gun from his waist and discreetly handed it under the table to [Fang Mu]. [Fang Mu] reached out and took the gun from under the table, holding it openly in his hand to examine it.
1:34:52|1:35:3|[Fang Mu] suddenly raised his hand and fired a shot at [Yang Xuewu], who instantly fell to the ground, his life hanging in the balance. The café descended into chaos as [Fang Mu] suddenly stood up, raised his hand towards the surveillance cameras in the shop and said,
1:35:4|1:35:14|After saying that, he placed the gun in his hand on the table and left. The incident in the cafe was captured on surveillance cameras and seen by everyone. Netizens started a heated discussion on the forum, with some people leaving shocked comments.
1:35:18|1:35:42|The City Light turns out to be a cop, and some people disdainfully say, "Is it necessary to be a police officer instead of doing a good job?" [Jiang Ya] also saw these comments, and he was so angry that he trembled and wrote down the words "Police are not the City Light". Just as he was about to send it out, he was interrupted by a sudden appearance of a waitress who proceeded to kick him out.
1:35:42|1:35:50|He reluctantly deleted the large characters he had just typed, then quietly left with his computer and phone. The outdoor café was already empty, with even the lights turned off.
1:35:52|1:36:4|He returned home alone, walked to a large fish tank, and pushed it forward with all his strength. The fish tank moved slowly and eventually bumped into another fish tank, forcing it to stop.
1:36:15|1:36:36|[Jiang Ya] released the fish tank, slowly straightened up, breathed a sigh of relief, turned her neck, and then walked towards the position that was originally covered by the fish tank. There was actually a secret passage leading underground. Walking down the long steps, [Jiang Ya] skillfully opened it. The dim light was not very bright, shining in the underground basement, adding a few more eerie touches.
1:36:37|1:36:43|The basement was very spacious, with a few iron shelves sporadically nailed to the walls, and there were no daily necessities.
1:36:44|1:36:51|[Jiang Ya] walked to the center of the basement and sat down on the steps with her legs bent, bowing her head and speaking softly.
1:36:57|1:37:12|A new friend has arrived. As soon as the words fell, the full view of the basement suddenly came into view. In the center of the room, there was a huge pool filled with liquid, and floating next to it was a naked body. [Jiang Ya] reached out and touched the body, with a face covered in corpse spots, a very frightening gesture distributed to all branches and police stations.
1:37:48|1:38:0|The killing in the cafe before the grazing caused a huge panic in the city, and reporters flocked to get some information from Director Liu, but ultimately seemed to have gained nothing.
1:38:0|1:38:18|[Fang Mu] hid in a duckbill cap at a roadside stall, eating with a blank expression while listening to the voice coming from his phone. He left a banknote on the table and departed alone from the city, heading towards the desolate outskirts. He then entered an abandoned factory building, surrounded by overgrown weeds and lacking even basic streetlights.
1:38:18|1:38:44|[Fang Mu] enters the abandoned building and starts climbing the stairs on foot. He walks up steadily, one floor at a time. Through the cracks in the corridor, it is clear to see that there is another person following behind [Fang Mu], who seems completely unaware of the presence behind him. The person just keeps walking upstairs persistently. Finally, he reaches the top of the building near the edge, lights a cigarette, takes a deep drag, stops in his tracks, and waits while smoking.
1:38:44|1:38:56|The person who quickly appeared on the rooftop behind him slowed down his pace, step by step approaching him. Then, he stopped at a distance and reached out to take off his hat. The man following Fang Mu was none other than Jiang Ya.
1:38:56|1:39:5|[Fang Mu] heard the movement behind him without any surprise, while [Jiang Ya] stood behind [Fang Mu] in silence for a moment before slowly speaking.
1:39:11|1:39:19|[Fang Mu] turned around and looked at [Jiang Ya] without saying a word. [Jiang Ya] stared at [Fang Mu] in front of him and spoke again.
1:39:30|1:39:43|Fang Mu looked somewhat smug as he chuckled and took another puff of his cigarette.
1:40:7|1:40:25|[Jiang Ya] was completely provoked by [Fang Mu]. He raised his fist and ran towards [Fang Mu], but [Fang Mu] dodged to the side, causing [Jiang Ya] to miss his punch and fall to the ground. [Fang Mu] took the opportunity to suppress him, but [Jiang Ya] tried to grab his leg to pull him down. However, [Jiang Ya] failed and instead was punched in the face by [Fang Mu].
1:40:25|1:40:38|He staggered back a few steps, then struggled to stand firm and continued to grapple with [Fang Mu]. The two of them fought desperately on the roof, with [Jiang Ya] pushing [Fang Mu] against the wall. [Fang Mu] struggled hard and managed to push the other person to the ground.
1:40:38|1:40:42|[Jiang Ya] was lying on the ground. As soon as she stood up, she was kicked by [Fang Mu] and fell into the puddle nearby.
1:40:42|1:40:53|However, [Jiang Ya] did not give up. Taking advantage of [Fang Mu]'s distraction, she grabbed him and jumped towards the glass window behind her. The glass shattered, and the two of them fell directly from the building.
1:40:55|1:41:13|They both fell heavily on the cement floor inside the building, lying there for a while without recovering. After a moment, they struggled to stand up together. [Fang Mu] took the initiative and kicked [Jiang Ya] down, but lost his balance and fell on the ground himself. He quickly got up and pounced on [Jiang Ya], grabbing his shoulders from behind.
1:41:13|1:41:16|Forcefully pull him up and throw him over the railing in front.
1:41:16|1:41:36|[Jiang Ya] was completely dazed, enduring the pain as he crawled forward on the ground built with iron mesh. [Fang Mu] staggered to his feet and crossed the railing towards Zhang Ya, grabbing [Jiang Ya]'s clothes to lift him off the ground and then heavily pressing him back down. [Jiang Ya] pushed Fang Mu away, then slowly moved backwards with his back against the ground.
1:41:36|1:41:55|He slowly moved his head to the edge of the road, his head hanging outside. Fang Mu caught up and started hitting him. Just as he stretched his head outside the railing, Jiang Ya used her clothes to strangle him. Fang Mu's neck got stuck on the railing, making it difficult for him to breathe and even deforming his face. He tried to support himself on the railing, gritting his teeth trying to break free, but Jiang Ya seemed to have used all her strength, and he couldn't struggle free no matter how hard he tried.
1:41:55|1:42:15|After a brief standoff, [Fang Mu] released her grip on the railing, one hand propped on [Jiang Ya]'s shoulder, the other hand clenched into a fist striking at [Jiang Ya]'s collar. After a few punches, [Jiang Ya] finally let go, [Fang Mu] fell to the ground and slowly started to get up. [Jiang Ya] picked up a large wrench nearby and struck [Fang Mu] forcefully, hitting her shoulder.
1:42:15|1:42:17|Lying on the ground, he began to wail.
1:42:17|1:42:36|[Jiang Ya] took this opportunity to push [Fang Mu] into the small room. Fang Mu lay on the ground in shock, before seeing Jiang Ya push over a large iron cabinet next to him. The cabinet fell directly towards Fang Mu, who widened his eyes in fear and quickly dodged. After narrowly escaping, the two began to struggle again in the narrow room.
1:42:36|1:42:50|[Jiang Ya] pinned [Fang Mu] on the lying cabinet and started punching and kicking. Despite the pain, [Fang Mu] grabbed [Jiang Ya]'s leg and forcefully twisted it, causing [Jiang Ya] to fall to the ground screaming in agony. [Fang Mu] then kicked [Jiang Ya] in the air, sending him flying several meters until he crashed into the wall.
1:42:50|1:43:8|[Jiang Ya] supported his chest, gasping heavily, while secretly picking up the glass shards beside him. He watched as [Fang Mu], who was getting closer to him, launched another attack. Unexpectedly, [Fang Mu] swiftly dodged and forcefully threw him out of the small room on the second floor again. [Fang Mu] leaned out of the window, looking down at him lying motionless on the wire mesh below.
1:43:8|1:43:20|[Jiang Ya] turned and walked downstairs. Just as she walked out of the stairwell, she was suddenly grabbed from behind by [Jiang Ya] and had a sack put over her head. [Fang Mu] struggled frantically, and the two of them pushed and shoved in the narrow corridor before falling down together.
1:43:20|1:43:44|Both of them were exhausted, lying on the ground without getting up for a long time. Suddenly, [Jiang Ya] pounced on [Fang Mu], flipping him over and locking him down with his arms. [Fang Mu] kicked wildly and struggled desperately, then he lifted [Jiang Ya]'s hand and bit it hard near his mouth. [Jiang Ya] screamed in pain, released [Fang Mu], and tried to dodge to the side, but [Fang Mu] still held onto [Jiang Ya]'s hand tightly, being dragged around but refusing to let go.
1:43:44|1:44:4|[Jiang Ya] could only use his other hand to pull [Fang Mu] and forcefully slam him against the wall, then he used his own head to hit [Fang Mu]'s head. Unexpectedly, [Fang Mu] still tightly held onto his hand, glaring at him fiercely. Helpless, [Jiang Ya] grabbed [Fang Mu] and they both fell from the high corridor directly onto the island below, knocking down a wall pillar in mid-air.
1:44:4|1:44:21|They fell on both sides of the coal pile, with [Fang Mu] lying motionless on the ground, his life hanging in the balance. [Jiang Ya] groaned and slowly propped himself up from the ground. It was obvious that his right hand was missing a index finger, the bone joints covered in dust and exposed. Surprisingly, [Fang Mu] had actually bitten off one of his fingers.
1:44:21|1:44:39|[Jiang Ya] trembled as he crawled towards [Fang Mu]. He turned the bloodied face of the other towards himself, then forcefully pried open his mouth and reached inside to feel around, but found nothing. [Jiang Ya] pulled his hand out of [Fang Mu]'s mouth, then took a phone out of the other's pocket and smashed it on the ground until it was completely destroyed. He squatted down to catch his breath.
1:44:39|1:44:44|Then she stood up and walked to [Fang Mu]'s feet, dragging his leg step by step outward.
1:44:44|1:45:2|The sky had completely darkened by now. [Jiang Ya] drove a small car to the desolate wilderness, where the dirt road was scattered with rocks and waist-high weeds. [Jiang Ya] parked the car, took out a towel, and carefully wiped the blood and dust off her face in the rearview mirror, one stroke at a time.
1:45:2|1:45:18|A few minutes later, [Jiang Ya] walked into an underground passage. The mottled white tiles on the wall were covered in dirt. He stared with wide eyes, a terrifying smile on his freshly cleaned face. Hunching slightly, he dragged [Fang Mu]'s left leg forward with one hand, while [Fang Mu] lay on the ground seemingly unconscious.
1:45:18|1:45:25|After a while, he slowly opened his eyes and tightly held the eternal flower given to him by [Mi Nan]. Through the corner of his eye, he saw [Jiang Ya] approaching with a pair of scissors.
1:45:38|1:45:49|[Jiang Ya] cut off [Fang Mu]'s T-shirt with a pair of scissors, then she put the scissors aside and stood up to get something.
1:46:10|1:46:19|Upon hearing Fang Mu's words, Jiang Ya limped back and leaned next to Fang Mu, glaring and saying,
1:46:51|1:47:4|[Fang Mu] didn't speak, just silently watched as [Jiang Ya] walked to the shelf and took down an axe. This was the first weapon I used to kill someone.
1:47:6|1:47:16|He raised the axe and smiled, then returned to [Fang Mu]'s side, lowering his head to whisper to him.
1:47:26|1:47:40|[Jiang Ya] raised the axe high and swung it down towards [Fang Mu]. The scene suddenly switched, showing [Yang Xuewu] sitting up from the hospital bed with a breathing machine. He recalled receiving a message from [Fang Mu] while sitting in the cafe, the content of which was just three words: believe in me.
1:47:40|1:47:47|[Yang Xuewu] rushed back to the police station in a patient gown without stopping, and as soon as he entered, he searched for the whereabouts of [Fang Mu], Old Mo.
1:47:54|1:48:9|Just then, several police officers escorted [Jiang Ya], who was wearing a prisoner's uniform, into the room. He limped to the front chair of the meeting room and sat down. [Mi Nan], dressed in a police uniform, followed behind [Jiang Ya]. He looked at the crowded room and saw the police officers holding USB drives in their hands, speaking to everyone.
1:48:11|1:48:38|He hoped that all of us would see that [Yang Xuewu] lost his strength instantly after hearing it, leaning against the table in the meeting room, including [Mi Nan] who turned to look at [Jiang Ya] sitting not far away. Then she opened the projector and played the content from the USB drive. Everyone in the meeting room stared intently at the big screen. [Fang Mu]'s figure appeared in the video, which was recorded before he met [Yang Xuewu] at the coffee shop, all at the Liu Bureau.
1:51:21|1:51:27|Fang Mu's face is filled with sadness, while Jiang Ya is still smiling.
1:51:33|1:51:39|[Mi Nan] stood in the corner sobbing, while [Jiang Ya] appeared very happy.
1:53:3|1:53:17|[Fang Mu]'s words resonated throughout the city, reaching everyone's ears. Everyone was shocked to see [Jiang Ya] standing in the courtroom, with a rare calmness on his face, slowly speaking to the judge.
1:53:21|1:53:39|He is the light illuminating the city. The scene suddenly cuts back to the moment when [Jiang Ya] raised the axe and swung it towards [Fang Mu].
1:53:39|1:54:0|He heard a noise behind him and went to check, only to find that the large fish tank that was blocking the door suddenly shattered. A wave-like rush of water came crashing down on him, causing [Jiang Ya] to fall heavily to the ground. Then, he was bitten by a large fish that ran out of the fish tank. Just at that moment, [Mi Nan] rushed in with a group of police officers. He looked at [Fang Mu], who was lying not far away in an unknown condition, and hurried over.
1:54:0|1:54:7|He held [Fang Mu] tightly and shook a forever flower vigorously, the forever flower quietly floating on the water behind him, showing respect for the deceased.
1:54:16|1:54:35|Perhaps for [Fang Mu], [Mi Nan] is the unique eternal flower that belongs to him, the special light in [Fang Mu]'s black and white world that shines with a different color.
1:54:37|1:54:50|Finally everything has settled, [Liao Yafan] came to the hospital to accompany [Fang Mu]. He slept soundly by the hospital bed. When [Fang Mu] woke up, he slowly reached out his scarred hand and gently held [Mi Nan]'s hand.
1:54:50|1:54:56|[Mi Nan] noticed that [Fang Mu] was awake and sat up nervously, looking at [Fang Mu].
1:55:0|1:55:9|[Mi Nan] smiled at [Fang Mu] and nodded heavily before replying.
