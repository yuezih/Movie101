0:0:50|0:0:57|[Igen Ken] has loved music since he was young, often walking on the street immersed in the world of music, paying no attention to what is happening around him.
0:0:57|0:1:4|Arriving at the company entrance, without paying attention, [Jin Guzhi] accidentally knocked the cleaning lady's head into a bucket of water.
0:1:4|0:1:6|Upon entering, [Jin Guzhi] was surrounded by a group of reporters for interviews.
0:1:48|0:1:52|In the blink of an eye, [Jin Guzhi] cautiously arrived at the door of the boss's office.
0:1:52|0:1:56|On his forehead, there was a big house-shaped birthmark, and the boss [Jin Guzhi] said angrily.
0:2:49|0:2:55|The boss, Jin Guzhi, clenched his teeth in anger and manually squeezed the oranges in his hand into orange juice.
0:2:55|0:2:57|[Jin Guzhi] nodded timidly, his face full of guilt as he spoke.
0:3:13|0:3:14|The boss, Jin Guzhi, was now looking impatient and began to shoo people away with his eyes closed.
0:3:14|0:3:19|Faced with the heartless eviction by the boss, [Jin Guzhi] could only look resentful and slowly walk towards the door.
0:7:50|0:7:55|The boss in a high-end suit is struggling to push [Jin Guzhi] sitting in the car.
0:7:55|0:8:1|Despite the boss's best efforts, he was so angry that he took off his coat and threw it onto the car, pointing at [Jin Guzhi] inside the car.
0:8:4|0:8:10|[Ken Iguchi] looked at the angry boss in the rearview mirror, then quietly pushed the mirror down.
0:8:10|0:8:16|The boss over here was still grinning and pushing the cart, and finally, with a roar, the cart started smoothly.
0:8:16|0:8:22|The sudden start of the car also caused the boss to fall flat on his face as usual.
0:8:22|0:8:27|The boss got up from the ground with a bewildered look on his face, his expression spelled out four words - disbelief.
0:8:28|0:8:35|He spat out a mouthful of sand, his eyes burning with raging fury.
0:8:35|0:8:42|He walked up to the car, opened the door in a grand manner, and suddenly remembered the coat he had just dropped behind him.
0:8:42|0:8:48|Turning around to close the car door and retrieve his coat, [Jin Guzhi] hadn't even had a chance to get in the car before it started moving away.
0:8:48|0:8:53|No matter how he shouted and chased from behind, the car showed no intention of stopping.
0:9:2|0:9:9|And at this moment, [Jin Guzhi] was still walking outside the car.
0:9:23|0:9:30|At this moment, the boss chasing the car was unexpectedly blocked by an iron fence, making the already difficult journey even more challenging for [Jin Guzhi].
0:9:30|0:9:36|And [Jin Guzhi] in the car continued to drive forward with a silly smile on his face, completely unaware that the boss had not gotten in the car yet.
0:9:38|0:9:48|At this moment, the boss who was climbing over the iron fence fell down. With a crisp tearing sound, he flipped over, but his pants were left on the fence.
0:9:48|0:9:56|The tattered fragments of pants fluttered in the wind, seemingly mocking the boss lying on the ground with a huge hole in his pants, looking utterly dejected.
0:9:57|0:10:9|The boss was thrown to the ground, dazed and confused, looking around blankly. Perhaps facing too many hardships today, he quickly pulled himself together, without complaining, just rubbed his butt, and struggled to get up.
0:10:9|0:10:26|He was wearing those thigh-high slit trousers, standing on the roadside looking around, raising his arm and thumb up, trying to flag down passing vehicles. Hoping for a kind soul to give him a ride back home to end this nightmare, but fate had other plans. The boss, unsuccessful in flagging down a car, lay despairingly on the roadside.
0:10:27|0:10:38|The scene cuts to Jin Guzhi, who miraculously comes back to life, standing on a tricycle holding the national flag. His face, originally covered in dirt, combined with his wind-blown messy hair at this moment, makes him look even more disheveled.
0:10:41|0:10:48|After enduring numerous hardships, [Jin Guzhi] finally got into the car, escaped from the highway, and returned to the city, sitting in the office.
0:10:48|0:10:53|[Jin Guzhi] had a band-aid on his face, angrily peeling an apple.
0:10:53|0:10:57|The mastermind, [Jin Guzhi], stood trembling in fear across from us.
0:10:57|0:11:3|He looked at the boss, swallowed nervously, hesitated, and finally mustered up the courage to speak to the boss.
0:11:9|0:11:13|The boss remained silent, continuing to peel the apple in his hand.
0:11:28|0:11:33|The boss glared at [Jin Guzhi], took a bite of the apple fiercely, panting heavily, but still didn't speak.
0:11:33|0:11:36|[Jin Guzhi] glanced at the boss and spoke.
0:12:3|0:12:18|The boss was so angry that his lips trembled, he squatted down and took out a pair of leather shoes. After venting, the boss seemed to have lost all his strength and slumped down in the chair.
0:13:2|0:13:11|The next morning, [Jin Guzhi], who had lost his driving privileges, hurriedly carried a large box filled with discs and got on the bus in a long line.
0:13:14|0:13:26|Under the scorching sun, with only a few pedestrians on the street, [Jin Guzhi] carried a box on his shoulder, shuttling through the streets and alleys of the city, panting heavily and sweating profusely.
0:13:26|0:13:36|After a busy half day, [Jin Guzhi] found a place with a few vendors setting up stalls, sat down, took out a piece of bread and a bottle of mineral water from the box, and ate them hungrily.
0:13:38|0:13:47|But at this moment, the nearby [vendor] went crazy, rolled up the stall and ran away, leaving [Jin Guzhi] looking confused and unable to figure out the situation.
0:14:7|0:14:11|[Jin Guzhi] seized the box while the urban management officers weren't paying attention, then ran off.
0:14:11|0:14:18|And so, Jin Guzhi and the urban management officers engaged in a city chase, but he didn't notice the cassette tapes falling behind him.
0:14:20|0:14:31|When [Jin Guzhi] successfully shook off the pursuers and ran into a narrow alley, panting heavily, he opened the box and looked down, only to find that all the CDs in the box were missing.
0:14:31|0:14:36|With only an empty box left, [Jin Guzhi] threw the box down, covered his face, and completely broke down.
0:14:36|0:14:39|Younger sister [Yili] looked at her brother who had returned home and said.
0:14:57|0:15:10|[Iken Ken] watched as his sister handed him the money, then turned and walked away. He looked at the two hundred yuan in his hand, patted it against his chest, and stared blankly ahead, lost in thought.
0:16:33|0:16:38|The boss, who doesn't mince words, finished talking about [Yili], and then patiently checked his twisted ankle.
0:17:18|0:17:24|And so, wearing high heels, [Yili] and the boss stood in front of the car, entering into a fierce battle mode where neither side would give way.
0:17:24|0:17:30|The verbal battle ended with [Jin Guzhi] fleeing in a car due to insufficient fighting power, bringing the curtain down.
0:17:30|0:17:33|Enraged, [Jin Guzhi] shouted loudly.
0:18:41|0:18:47|Early the next morning, just as the day was breaking, [Jin Guzhi] arrived at the park with a clock and a guitar.
0:18:47|0:18:58|The park was still quiet at this moment, with Jin Guzhi placing his watch on the rockery and sitting cross-legged on the opposite side with a guitar in his arms, setting up a posture but staring motionlessly at the watch.
0:18:59|0:19:8|The clock kept ticking, time passing by second by second, while [Jin Guzhi] remained in his posture, sitting there motionless.
0:19:8|0:19:15|The passing old man was intrigued by the strange behavior of [Jin Guzhi]. He bent down curiously to look at [Jin Guzhi], who was holding a guitar and doing something unknown.
0:19:16|0:19:19|Glanced again at the ordinary clock across the room.
0:19:19|0:19:24|The confused old man, Jin Guzhi, walked up to the artificial hill and leaned in to observe carefully.
0:19:24|0:19:27|After watching for a while, I really can't figure out what's going on.
0:19:27|0:19:35|The old man couldn't stand it anymore. He simply walked up and, imitating Jin Guzhi's appearance, sat there motionless, staring blankly at the clock.
0:19:35|0:19:42|As time passed, more and more people were drawn to this strange scene, and there were more and more heads around observing the clock.
0:19:43|0:20:5|[Jin Guzhi]'s figure gradually disappeared into the crowded sea of people, and as a sudden alarm clock rang urgently, the motionless [Jin Guzhi] finally spoke.
0:20:5|0:20:9|With Jin Guzhi's words, the onlookers scattered in all directions.
0:20:19|0:20:31|At this moment, [Jin Guzhi] lowered his head and stopped speaking, sighed solemnly, looked into the distance with a complex expression on his face, and then fell into a reverie.
0:20:31|0:20:38|In the fantasy, a group of burly men wearing sunglasses are beating up the boss in a secluded forest.
0:20:38|0:20:45|At this moment, [Jin Guzhi] descended like a hero, spreading out his cloak, holding a sword in his hand, and shouting loudly.
0:20:52|0:21:0|The villains who were originally targeting the boss all rushed towards [Jin Guzhi], raining punches down on the hero [Jin Guzhi] who was saving the beauty.
0:21:0|0:21:6|After an intense fight, [Jin Guzhi] lay on the ground, gasping for breath, defeated by his opponent.
0:21:6|0:21:14|The boss, trembling, crawled over and lay beside [Jin Guzhi], slowly lifting his head and looking at him affectionately.
0:21:26|0:21:30|Upon hearing what the boss said, [Jin Guzhi] nodded in approval and started to work diligently.
0:21:30|0:21:34|Back in reality, [Jin Guzhi] smiled as if he had come up with a good idea.
0:21:40|0:21:56|The scene shifts, with the boss's daughter [Jin Guzhi] playing with a puppy on the grass in the park, while the boss exercises nearby, swinging his arms loudly. Meanwhile, [Yigen Jian] hides behind a trash can with a few people, secretly observing the boss's every move.
0:21:56|0:22:0|At this moment, a relatively cautious man spoke up.
0:22:7|0:22:16|During the discussion among the group, a passerby picked his nose and accurately threw the trash onto the head of one of the bald men.
0:22:16|0:22:26|After speaking, everyone saw the boss take out two small dumbbells from behind the seemingly heavy dumbbell, and lifted them up. [Jin Guzhi] saw this and chuckled lightly.
0:22:34|0:22:40|And at this moment, the bald man who was peeking was hit by a watermelon seed shell thrown by a passing middle-aged woman.
0:23:7|0:23:19|Suddenly, an old man who was gargling walked towards us. He spat the mouthwash into the trash can, splashing the bald man's face. Everyone looked at him with disgust, and he could only helplessly wipe his face and say.
0:24:25|0:24:29|The boss looked at the two unexpected guests in front of him with a puzzled expression.
0:24:29|0:24:32|He rolled up his sleeves and walked slowly, unable to get through.
0:24:32|0:24:36|In the next moment, the boss raised his hand and kicked Jin Guzhi, sending him tumbling to the ground.
0:24:36|0:24:39|Another person, seeing the situation, limped away in panic.
0:24:41|0:24:48|At this moment, [Jin Guzhi], hiding behind the trash can, looked at everything in front of him, exchanging an incredulous glance.
0:24:48|0:24:53|[Igen Ken] saw the plan fail, turned and left, while his sister looked at the little dog in front of the boss's house.
0:25:14|0:25:20|After hearing this, [Jin Guzhi] squinted his eyes, furrowed his brows, and scrunched up his face into a ball, staring at the little dog.
0:26:4|0:26:10|[Jin Guzhi] looked at [Jin Guzhi] with a disdainful expression, and said with a smirk.
0:26:10|0:26:15|The scene shifts, and the boss's beloved dog is barking anxiously in the cage outside the house.
0:26:47|0:26:51|[Jin Guzhi] and [Jin Guzhi] rushed out of the court after leaving.
0:26:51|0:26:56|As soon as they stepped out, they saw the boss and Jin Guzhi looking at the precious dog locked in a cage.
0:26:56|0:27:0|[Ken Ine] lowered his head in guilt when facing the angry face of [Jin Guzhi], the boss.
0:27:23|0:27:32|The boss finished speaking, put down his crossed legs, stood up from the sofa, hands on hips, angrily walked towards [Igen Ken], staring into his eyes.
0:27:42|0:27:46|After the boss left, Jin Guzhi and his two siblings were left at home, looking at each other in silence.
0:27:46|0:27:51|Jin Guzhi glanced left and right, sighed, and said angrily.
0:28:45|0:28:50|After the younger brother finished speaking, he looked at the unreliable duo in front of him and left with a slam of the door.
0:28:50|0:28:54|The night grew darker, but [Jin Guzhi] lying on the bed tossed and turned, unable to fall asleep.
0:28:54|0:28:57|Turning off the lights, the words that Jin Guzhi's younger brother said before leaving gradually appeared in his mind.
0:29:4|0:29:18|In the dim light of dawn, after a sleepless night, Jin Guzhi, with swollen eyes, arrived at a secluded place surrounded by abandoned European-style buildings. The once magnificent buildings, now weathered by wind and rain day after day, had become dilapidated.
0:29:19|0:29:35|The streets were deserted, with no one in sight. [Jin Guzhi] looked around, the walls uneven and peeling, covered in cobwebs in the corners. The cold wind blew, causing the beaded curtains between the broken walls to sway. The inner walls bore the marks of rain, mottled and faded.
0:29:35|0:29:43|Further ahead, scattered gravel and debris covered the ground, with wild grasses growing abundantly. Wild vines twisted up along the broken door lintel.
0:29:44|0:29:50|Jin Guzhi walked slowly into one of the buildings, looking around, carefully examining everything around him.
0:29:50|0:30:0|The wall was already covered in delicate patterns. Seeing everything in front of him, [Jin Guzhi] seemed to breathe a sigh of relief, drinking water heavily before continuing to move forward.
0:30:0|0:30:7|Upstairs, the poor light penetrates through, revealing the sunlight, and the dim daylight clearly reflects the fine dust floating in the air.
0:30:7|0:30:13|[Jin Guzhi] saw a long-haired, dirty-faced, smoke-surrounded [vagabond] in front of him.
0:30:14|0:30:24|The homeless man [Jin Guzhi] who was eating, saw someone approaching but didn't pay much attention. He just glanced casually, then continued gnawing on the chicken leg, occasionally taking a sip of beer on the side.
0:30:24|0:30:30|[The homeless man] had some simple living supplies behind him, looking like he had made a home in this abandoned building.
0:30:30|0:30:35|[The homeless man] looked up in confusion as [Jin Guzhi] approached, and [Jin Guzhi] immediately spoke.
0:32:9|0:32:13|The homeless man glanced up and down, Jin Guzhi said.
0:34:48|0:35:2|[Iken Ken] looked at the man in front of him, took out a few hundred yuan from his pocket, counted a few bills, but hesitated a bit. Just as he was about to take it back, the quick-handed [Jin Guzhi] reached out and snatched it away.
0:35:44|0:35:51|At night, [Jin Guzhi], who had planned everything, sneakily approached the boss's car and peeked inside through the window.
0:36:45|0:36:49|The rejected siblings took out two pig head masks from their bag and put them on.
0:37:5|0:37:6|The boss clapped his hands helplessly.
0:37:22|0:37:30|The two looked at Jin Guzhi, who had agreed to help them passively, and quickly ran all the way to the back of the car, pushing the boss sitting inside.
0:37:30|0:37:38|The boss looked at the two people pushing the car with all their might, and smiled with relief. However, the car had only moved a short distance before it became impossible to push any further.
0:38:9|0:38:13|The brother and sister were delighted and quickly got into the car following [the boss].
0:38:15|0:38:27|The car slowly started and soon arrived at a deserted place. In front of them was a building, the steps covered in weeds, looking eerie in the moonlight.
0:38:27|0:38:36|As soon as the car stopped, Jin Guzhi was the first to get out and rush into the building. The boss poked his head out and asked, looking at the tall building in front of him.
0:39:8|0:39:14|[Iken Ken] closed the car door, ran to the back of the car, stuffed the banana in his hand into the exhaust pipe, and then slipped away.
0:39:14|0:39:26|The [boss] sitting in the car was completely unaware and ready to set off, only to find that the car wouldn't start no matter what. He hurriedly shouted for [Jin Guzhi].
0:39:38|0:39:43|Unable to call out to [Jin Guzhi]'s [boss], [Ma Dongmei] opened the car door with a look of resentment, ready to go in search of [Jin Guzhi].
0:39:43|0:39:52|Just as [Jin Guzhi] saw the [boss] inside the building, he was startled by the pitch-black environment.
0:39:52|0:40:2|In the pitch-black building, unable to see a thing, [Jin Guzhi], the boss who entered the building, complained while waving his arms to distinguish the direction, cautiously feeling his way forward.
0:40:4|0:40:10|With a mask on, [Jin Guzhi] sat in the back holding a guitar, watching the boss who was getting more and more panicked with widened eyes.
0:40:10|0:40:18|At this moment, a beam of light suddenly lit up behind the boss. Turning around, he saw the siblings [Igen Ken] appearing with masks on.
0:41:54|0:41:59|[Jin Guzhi] and his sister exchanged a glance, and the next moment, the boss was taken into the building and tied up.
0:41:59|0:42:3|The siblings [Igen Ken] glanced at each other, and the boss with a disgruntled expression said.
0:44:12|0:44:17|The two of them, whether to explain first or listen first, started an endless debate.
0:44:17|0:44:19|And at this moment, [Jin Guzhi] was completely unaware at home.
0:45:48|0:45:49|Jin Guzhi scolded with a sword in hand.
0:45:53|0:45:54|The boss shook his head and said.
0:46:44|0:46:48|Upon hearing this, Jin Guzhi's eyes flickered, as if he had thought of something.
0:46:48|0:46:53|The scene shifts, Jin Guzhi goes out to look for the boss Geng Zhuang, and the phone rings.
0:47:42|0:47:45|Upon hearing his wife's words, the boss, who had originally closed his eyes, suddenly widened them.
0:48:5|0:48:8|After Jin Guzhi finished speaking, [Igen Ken] turned his head, covered his ears, and went back to sleep.
0:49:1|0:49:7|Upon hearing this, Jin Guzhi, who had a determined look on his face, slowly collapsed and said with a turn of his eyes.
0:49:49|0:49:51|[Jin Guzhi] said her parents went missing.
0:49:59|0:50:8|In the abandoned building, the boss and a [Jin Guzhi] faced off against two aggressive opponents, glaring at each other and refusing to back down.
0:50:8|0:50:14|Before long, younger brother [Yi Genzhuang] arrived with his girlfriend [Jin Guzhi] in a taxi.
0:50:18|0:50:21|[Jin Guzhi] walked in and saw four people sitting together, each refusing to yield to the other.
0:51:19|0:51:26|In this way, the boss and his family of three were all tied up with swords, fulfilling the request for a reunion in a bizarre way.
0:51:26|0:51:32|The boss widened his eyes to six times their normal size, trying to see clearly the absurdity in front of him, feeling it all to be unbelievable.
0:51:32|0:51:39|One [Jin Guzhi] held a steaming kettle and poured a basin of hot water for the boss's family to wash their faces. The boss pushed it aside when he saw it, speaking as if scolding.
0:51:39|0:51:47|Jin Guzhi woke up his sleeping wife and the boss's wife looked at the hot water in front of her, shaking her head and saying.
0:51:47|0:51:57|[Jin Guzhi] saw that no one was accepting it, shook his head helplessly, placed the basin on a nearby chair, and silently sat down next to [Jin Zhuang], who was also tied up.
0:51:57|0:52:4|As the older sister, [Igen Ken] watched [Igen Zhuang], who was tied up and dejected, with a heart full of pity.
0:52:4|0:52:9|Unable to bear watching his younger brother suffer, [Jin Guzhi] pulled on the rope in [Yigenzhuang]'s hand and said to him.
0:52:15|0:52:19|[Igen Zhuang] shook off [Igen Jian]'s hand and turned his head to the side.
0:52:19|0:52:24|At this moment, Jin Guzhi curled up his arms and walked to the boss, trying to please him.
0:54:37|0:54:43|Just as Jin Guzhi was buying youtiao, the homeless man who used to live in this abandoned building suddenly returned.
0:54:43|0:54:47|[Jin Guzhi] walked over, smiling and touching his face.
0:55:19|0:55:24|The young man selling fried dough sticks didn't hear Jin Guzhi's call, so he hopped on his bicycle and chased after Jin Guzhi.
0:56:23|0:56:28|Just like that, the homeless man [Jin Guzhi] who thought he was just acting in a movie also had his hands tied.
0:56:28|0:56:33|Looking at the boss's family, who were also tied up, [Jin Guzhi] greeted them with a smile.
0:56:33|0:56:38|Bro, I'm telling you the truth. After saying that, [Jin Guzhi] looked around and finally realized that something was not quite right.
0:57:10|0:57:15|When [Jin Guzhi] returned with breakfast, looking exhausted, the [vagrant] looked at him with a face full of surprise.
0:57:26|0:57:32|The boss looked at the breakfast placed in front of him by [Jin Guzhi], scratched his nose, and closed his eyes.
0:57:32|0:57:36|[Ken Ine] sighed and placed the breakfast next to the boss.
0:57:36|0:57:41|Turning around, only to find that the person next to him was actually [Jin Guzhi].
0:58:31|0:58:36|At this moment, the fried dough stick vendor also closely followed [Jin Guzhi] to the vicinity of the building.
0:58:36|0:58:42|The oil stick guy riding a bicycle is not much slower than [Jin Guzhi], and he quickly catches up with him.
0:58:42|0:58:53|The oil stick guy who had already ridden past the building suddenly saw Jin Guzhi's car turning back, stopping at the entrance and looking around as if he couldn't believe someone would live here.
0:58:53|0:58:56|After confirming for a while, Jin Guzhi finally stopped the car and entered the building.
0:58:58|0:59:2|On the other side, the boss's wife in the building is still holding a youtiao, trying to get the boss to eat it.
0:59:2|0:59:6|The boss, Jin Guzhi, who had his eyes closed, was startled by the youtiao brought to his mouth.
0:59:8|0:59:14|After going through all kinds of hardships to deliver the money, the oil stick delivery guy, [Jin Guzhi], suddenly appeared in front of everyone, catching them off guard.
0:59:57|1:0:4|The dough stick guy looked back at the crowd and finally sensed something was wrong. The boss took the opportunity to frown and wink at the guy.
1:0:22|1:0:32|Hearing this, Jin Guzhi ran off in a hurry, but to his frustration, he ended up running in circles along the corridor, unable to find the door.
1:0:45|1:0:53|Thus, the hostage group gained a new member as the fried dough stick guy was also tied up. [Jin Guzhi], seeing this, reached out and handed his own fried dough stick to him.
1:1:18|1:1:28|With a face full of grievances, [Jin Guzhi] looked at the eager fried dough stick guy, then glanced at the serious [Jin Guzhuang], and could only reluctantly give him half of the hamburger.
1:1:28|1:1:34|The doughnut guy picked up the hamburger and ate it without any hesitation, while the [vagrant] next to him watched and swallowed his saliva.
1:2:55|1:3:0|The scene changes, with [Jin Guzhi] wearing leather shoes, struggling to pedal a tricycle.
1:3:0|1:3:4|In the car were the two pots of flowers and a duck that the fried dough stick guy mentioned.
1:3:7|1:3:10|In the blink of an eye, Jin Guzhi rode his bike through the desolate streets.
1:3:10|1:3:16|Returned to the building with something.
1:3:16|1:3:22|Inside the building, everyone looked at a person squatting over there feeding ducks with a puzzled expression on their faces. [Jin Guzhi]
1:3:37|1:3:41|After speaking, [Jin Guzhi] slung the sword over his shoulder.
1:3:41|1:3:47|A person who is slightly smaller than Jin Guzhi in stature, yet he looks completely at ease, even swaying a couple of times while carrying it.
1:3:47|1:3:52|One person on the top floor didn't stand firm and brightly put his younger brother down.
1:3:57|1:4:2|After scratching his head and chin in contemplation, [Jin Guzhi] spoke.
1:4:30|1:4:33|With persuasion failing, [Jin Guzhi] lifted the sword on his shoulder with a look of helplessness.
1:4:35|1:4:39|After going downstairs, [Jin Guzhi] looked at [Igen Ken] arranging flowers and said to himself.
1:5:32|1:5:42|The boss, like Jin Guzhi, passionately scolded the sword, who listened with a pained expression, wanting to interrupt the boss's incessant chatter several times but never finding the opportunity to speak.
1:5:42|1:5:48|The boss became more and more excited as he spoke, his facial expressions gradually contorting, sometimes beaming with joy and sometimes filled with sorrow.
1:7:3|1:7:12|[Igen Ken] glared at the smirking You Tiao Guy with a face full of anger, not saying a word, just holding up the stinky sock in his hand in front of him.
1:7:12|1:7:18|The young man selling fried dough sticks was so frightened that his mouth dropped open, his eyes widened, he swallowed hard, and he dared not make a sound again.
1:7:19|1:7:27|Jin Guzhi took the socks from [Yi Genjian] and, looking at [Yi Genjian], stuffed them into his own mouth, with a pained expression, indicating that he would no longer make any noise.
1:7:27|1:7:31|The nearby [vagrant] had a keen eye and a strong will to survive, reacting swiftly to the situation.
1:7:32|1:7:37|Taking the initiative, Jin Guzhi took off his socks and obediently stuffed them into his mouth, looking up at [Yigen Jian] pitifully.
1:7:37|1:7:42|The boss here is still persistently gesturing to his wife, planning an escape.
1:7:42|1:7:46|Jin Guzhi next to them, but they were too busy to pay any attention to him, busy organizing their toiletries.
1:7:46|1:7:50|[Ken Ine] took out a set of dentures from the bag and handed them to the boss's wife.
1:7:50|1:7:53|Approaching the boss again, Jin Guzhi took out a toothbrush cup and said to the boss:
1:8:8|1:8:20|The boss's wife accepted the dentures on behalf of the boss who refused, while [Jin Guzhi] continued to smile and distribute them one by one without missing anyone.
1:8:26|1:8:32|[Jin Guzhi] didn't speak when he saw the boss. The boss's wife looked around and pulled the sock out of the boss's mouth.
1:8:32|1:8:38|The boss without socks sighed deeply, didn't say a word, just looked ahead with a numb expression.
1:8:38|1:8:43|The boss's wife took the mouthwash cup handed to her by [Jin Guzhi] and placed it in front of the boss.
1:8:43|1:8:46|The boss took a look and finally opened his mouth.
1:8:46|1:8:49|Unexpectedly, the next second, Jin Guzhi actually pressed down the mouthwash.
1:9:13|1:9:17|After saying that, Jin Guzhi stood up and walked out.
1:9:17|1:9:22|Sitting on the steps, [Jin Guzhi] looked melancholic, lowered his head and pulled out a weed, fidgeting restlessly.
1:11:21|1:11:26|The crowd was taken aback, looking at [Jin Guzhi] who suddenly became enraged, breathing heavily in anger.
1:11:26|1:11:31|At this moment, [Jin Guzhi] stood up and went to comfort [Yigenzhuang].
1:13:35|1:13:37|Listening to everyone's persuasion, [Jin Guzhi] was lost in thought.
1:13:37|1:13:39|The boss fell into contemplation.
1:13:39|1:13:42|After thinking for a long time, [Jin Guzhi] opened his mouth and said to [Igen Ken].
1:13:49|1:13:55|And at this moment, [Jin Guzhi] standing on the rooftop suddenly heard his sister's voice.
1:13:55|1:13:59|[Jin Guzhi] turned around, furrowed his brow, and looked at his sister.
1:14:26|1:14:32|Upon hearing Jin Guzhi's words, Jin Guzhi paused for a moment, shook his head with a bitter smile, and said.
1:14:50|1:14:56|Upon hearing this, [Jin Guzhi] widened his eyes and looked at his sister in disbelief.
1:14:56|1:15:11|Downstairs, the untied crowd is massaging, arm wrestling, all looking like they want to die.
1:15:11|1:15:13|Looking down at Jin Guzhi, the boss spoke.
1:15:21|1:15:34|[Igen Ken] took a look and immediately sat down obediently.
1:15:34|1:15:37|After Jin Guzhi left, he glanced at the boss and found an empty seat to sit down.
1:15:37|1:15:41|The boss, looking at everyone who had finished their tasks, finally felt satisfied and continued to speak.
1:15:52|1:16:6|The homeless man [Jin Guzhi] suddenly burst into laughter, which almost made the boss fall off his chair in fright. He then looked at [Yili] with a furrowed brow and fearfully stuffed his socks into his mouth.
1:16:6|1:16:8|Upon hearing this, Jin Guzhi and the alliance spat out the socks.
1:17:0|1:17:4|[Jin Guzhi] looked at the surprise in front of him, and the boss who reached out to him with a smile.
1:17:4|1:17:13|Just as they were about to shake hands and make peace, they were suddenly interrupted by the sound of police sirens. Everyone looked outside together and saw several police cars driving towards them.
1:17:13|1:17:28|The car stopped downstairs, and a team of SWAT police officers got out of the car. They held their guns in a neat line and aimed at the building. Inside the building, [Jin Guzhi] was scared and covered his ears. He comforted him and reported the situation to the police.
1:17:28|1:17:33|Turning around, [Jin Guzhi] saw the homeless man and the fried dough stick guy carrying a small stool following behind.
1:17:33|1:17:40|[Jin Guzhi] and his mother huddled together, and the boss unexpectedly had a gun pointed at his head.
1:18:45|1:18:49|Upon hearing the captain's orders, the police officers swiftly surrounded the entire building with their guns.
1:19:27|1:19:32|Just as the boss's wife here was about to turn around, she was pulled back by [Jin Guzhi].
1:19:32|1:19:38|After finishing speaking, the bandit looked at the people in the building again, staring at [Igen Ken] intently, and after a long pause, he spoke.
1:19:46|1:19:54|[Ken Ine] slowly walked towards the thug holding a gun, and when he reached him, the thug kicked the boss onto the bed.
1:19:54|1:19:58|The boss who was kicked on the bed sat up and pointed back to block the villain.
1:20:25|1:20:31|The thugs were dumbfounded as they looked at the crowd unwilling to leave, holding their guns, not knowing who to aim at for a moment. 
1:20:31|1:20:34|And at this moment, the police downstairs had quietly surrounded the area.
1:21:25|1:21:31|After saying that, [Jin Guzhi] raised his head high, chest out, and stared straight at the villain.
1:21:31|1:21:36|The thug looked at [Jin Guzhi] in front of him, nervously licked his lips, and gripped the gun in his hand pointing it at him.
1:22:15|1:22:19|[Jin Guzhi] swallowed and continued speaking.
1:22:43|1:22:51|[Jin Guzhi] and [Yi Li] watched the two people nervously.
1:22:51|1:22:57|After entering the hall, [Jin Guzhi] widened his eyes in disbelief.
1:22:57|1:23:2|He turned his head towards the direction pointed by [Igen Ken], and the [vagrant] and the fried dough stick guy nodded in response.
1:23:44|1:23:50|Pressed tightly against us with his own body.
1:24:7|1:24:19|The crowd here was deeply moved, with tears in their eyes, upon hearing this.
1:24:19|1:24:25|When it comes to [Jin Guzhi] here, a slight smile suddenly appeared on his face. He looked at [Igen] and [Igenzhuang], trembling lips as he spoke.
1:25:38|1:25:49|At the thought of all this, [Jin Guzhi] felt like there was a sharp and merciless knife in his chest, cutting his heart one by one, with blood dripping drop by drop.
1:25:49|1:25:52|The pain was so sharp, so profound.
1:26:12|1:26:17|The silent criminal was engaged in a fierce internal struggle.
1:26:17|1:26:24|The thug put down his gun and looked at a sincere Jin Guzhi.
1:26:24|1:26:33|The thug looked at the outstretched hand in front of him, his expression rapidly changing, his pale lips trembling, but unable to make a sound.
1:26:33|1:26:38|With the sound of the gun hitting the ground, the criminal slowly reached out his hand and placed it on [Jin Guzhi]'s hand.
1:26:42|1:26:46|The police officer turned around in surprise after hearing it.
1:26:46|1:26:55|The police officer who heard this immediately rushed towards the building, while the sniper upstairs was closely monitoring the movements of the criminals.
1:26:55|1:27:1|[Ken Iguchi], who was also being held up by the police, turned his head and smiled at the criminals.
1:27:1|1:27:5|After speaking, [Jin Guzhi] followed the police and the crowd inside the building also followed at this moment.
1:27:8|1:27:20|Hearing the shout from behind, [Jin Guzhi] turned his head and saw [Igen Ken] standing behind him, who had just shared a life-and-death experience with him.
1:27:20|1:27:26|Watching [Igen Ken] being taken away by the police, the boss said with tears in his eyes.
1:27:56|1:28:2|With the closing of the door, [Jin Guzhi] was taken into the police car, heading towards an unknown fate.
1:28:2|1:28:6|[Igen Ken] and his sister [Igen Ken] knelt on the ground, watching their brother's figure disappear into the distance.
1:28:6|1:28:11|At this moment, this grand kidnapping incident came to an end.
