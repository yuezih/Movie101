0:2:52|0:3:10|Jinghai heard his junior brother calling, hurriedly walked to the side of the injured person. He saw the injured person lying in his junior brother's arms. Jinghai quickly rolled up his sleeves to check his pulse, then reached out to pinch the injured person's philtrum. Suddenly a row of war horses galloped over, the iron cavalry trampling over the scorched earth and heading straight ahead.
0:3:11|0:3:30|Jinghai looked up and saw two groups of people chasing each other frantically. The pursuers behind tightly clamped their legs on the horse's belly, raised their guns and shot forward. With the miserable cry of the horses being shot, the soldiers in front were instantly knocked down. The leader in front turned his head and saw his entire army defeated, which only accelerated his own escape.
0:3:30|0:3:36|Soldiers who were just shot off their horses knelt on both sides of the road, raising their hands in surrender.
0:3:39|0:3:57|The surrendered soldier was shot dead by random gunfire. Seeing this scene on the roadside, the two young monks clasped their hands together, their expressions showing obvious confusion and reluctance. The pursuing soldiers, however, paid no attention, as they raised their long spears, waved their military flags, and hurriedly galloped past the monks on their steeds.
0:3:57|0:4:7|The monks, faced with such brutality, all stopped in their tracks. Shaolin Temple was enveloped in a picturesque landscape of green mountains and clear waters, with wisps of mist gently rising.
0:4:7|0:4:28|During the war, the Shaolin Temple opened its doors to shelter the refugees outside the temple, where several monks were distributing food to the injured refugees who couldn't move. Soup kitchens were set up in various places in the refugee camp to solve the problem of hunger for the countless people seeking refuge.
0:4:58|0:5:28|Jingneng gave a meaningful glance at Jingkong, then walked into the Shaolin Temple without looking back. Jingkong shook his head disapprovingly, then turned and quickly followed the senior brother's figure. Suddenly, the sound of galloping horses came from afar, and the pursuers had arrived outside the refugee camp. The refugees scattered and fled at the sight of the soldiers' arrival, while the main force rode warhorses fiercely towards the Shaolin Temple. They rode through the refugee camp, and the refugees around them were like startled birds, avoiding them and hiding in their own huts.
0:5:29|0:5:49|At a command, the troops rushed into the refugee camp for a search. The deputy officer [Cao Man] calmly stood still, holding the reins and looking around. His men rampaged through the camp, behaving brutally, riding horses and wielding guns to overturn the shelters where refugees sought refuge, all under the command of [Cao Man].
0:5:49|0:6:0|Sitting coldly on the horseback, [Ma Dongmei] watched as countless bamboo sheds were once again overturned by soldiers, some wielding bayonets to stab at any place where people could hide, while others forcibly drove away the refugees arriving at this place.
0:6:9|0:6:20|Soldiers rode black horses towards the shack, paying no attention to whether there were people inside. [Cao Man] sat on a horse in the distance, observing the actions in the refugee camp. Huo Long, enduring his injuries, staggered into the gates of the Shaolin Temple.
0:6:22|0:6:30|In the distance, [Cao Man] seemed to have caught sight of [Hou Jie]'s trail. He tightened his legs around the horse's belly, raised his whip, and galloped towards the Shaolin Temple.
0:6:42|0:6:50|With the reins tightly held in his hand, [Abbot] emerged at the sound, and Huo Long, who narrowly escaped death, immediately threw himself at [Abbot] seeking refuge.
0:6:56|0:7:16|[Cao Man] suddenly pulled the horse's head, knocking [Jingkong] to the ground in front of him. Then he lifted the horse's front hoof, intending to crush [Jingkong], but [Jingkong] quickly dodged. Seeing this, [Cao Man] was about to charge into the temple when [Jingkong] stood up again and blocked his way, leading to a stalemate between the two.
0:7:16|0:7:23|Suddenly, the warhorse, pulled by [Jingkong], lost its balance and with a roar, threw the two people off the steps.
0:7:23|0:7:44|[Cao Man] rolled on the ground for a few rounds before stopping, [Jingkong] unwilling to show weakness, only to see his legs flying up in the air, chopping down towards [Cao Man]. [Jingneng] both hands out like a dragon, the attack making [Cao Man] overwhelmed, [Jingneng] suddenly kicked towards his lower body, [Cao Man] staggered forward and then pointed the gun at [Jingneng].
0:7:44|0:7:59|Facing the unreasonable behavior of [Cao Man], [Jing Neng] remained expressionless. [Cao Man] cursed and spat, then pointed the gun at [Fangzhang] beside him.
0:8:11|0:8:29|The sound of powerful footsteps could be heard from a distance, as a large group of people entered in an orderly manner. They surrounded the courtyard as the soldiers in front dispersed, revealing [Hou Jie] at the back riding a tall steed and holding the reins, temporarily stopping at the inner courtyard gate.
0:8:38|0:8:59|[Cao Man]'s arrogance disappeared in an instant, [Hou Jie] calmly rode his horse down the steps and slowly entered the courtyard of the Shaolin Temple. His men with discerning eyes quickly helped him dismount and lead the horse, but [Hou Jie] paid no attention, walking straight towards the [Abbot].
0:10:20|0:10:30|[Hou Jie] heard Huo Long's plea for mercy, feeling moved, but after a long contemplation, he slowly walked forward and took the treasure map from him.
0:10:30|0:10:38|Huo Long carefully observed the expression of [Hou Jie], who looked at the treasure map in his hand and couldn't help but laugh, but quickly restrained himself.
0:10:38|0:10:55|He hid the treasure map in his arms, bowed to [Abbot], then turned and walked towards the temple gate. [Huo Long] finally breathed a sigh of relief, his whole body slumping down. Seeing [Huo Long] in distress, the Abbot's face lit up with joy and he quickly helped [Huo Long] up. Despite the pain, [Huo Long] tried to express his gratitude to the Abbot.
0:11:1|0:11:34|[Huo Long] pale-faced, looked unbelievably behind him. [Cao Man] quietly watched [Hou Jie], who was already accustomed to such scenes. [Jing Neng] immediately stood in front of [Fang Zhen]. Upon hearing [Fang Zhen]'s words, [Jing Neng] and [Jing Kong] felt indignant, but still restrained themselves. [Hou Jie], with a disdainful look, turned and left. As he passed through the courtyard, he was attracted by the plaque of the Grand Martial Arts Master on the ground, pausing in front of it.
0:11:52|0:11:59|[Hou Jie] wrote a few words on the plaque with a pen, then casually threw the pen away and left. [Jing Neng] and [Jing Kong] turned around to look back.
0:11:59|0:12:8|The soldiers put away their guns and followed their leader out of the Shaolin Temple. The four big characters written in red on the plaque were particularly eye-catching. At this moment,
0:12:8|0:12:19|Inside Dengfeng City, colorful lanterns and decorations are hung everywhere, colorful flags stand tall in various places, and rooftops flutter in the wind. The people hang up a portrait of [Hou Jie] on the city wall, setting off firecrackers to celebrate his arrival.
0:12:19|0:12:35|The sky in the city is also covered by the smoke from the firecrackers, everywhere is hazy, through the smoke only to see the large army of [Hou Jie] walking towards the city, the honor guard leading the way, walking at the forefront, banging drums and gongs, the sounds of celebration are endless.
0:12:35|0:12:59|Accompanied by joyful cheers, the residents and officers in Dengfeng City voluntarily lined the streets to welcome [Hou Jie], waving the military flag symbolizing him. The scene was grand, with [Hou Jie] embraced by the crowd. In the center of the crowd, he saw the people of the city welcoming him, bringing a smile to his face. Following closely behind [Hou Jie] were his wife and daughter, seated on a carriage.
0:13:42|0:14:5|[Hou Jie] smiled at [Cao Man] and didn't respond to her words. Pouting, he urged his warhorse to stride quickly towards [Song Hu].
0:14:44|0:14:52|[Hou Jie] glanced at [Song Hu] knowingly and grinned.
0:14:52|0:14:58|[Song Hu] couldn't help but laugh at the sight, then rode past [Hou Jie].
0:15:34|0:15:51|With a slight smile on his lips, Song Hu couldn't help but burst into laughter when he saw him like this, then turned and left. His wife [Yan Xi] held the child tightly in her arms, while [Cao Man] squinted his eyes and looked back and forth between the two. As Song Hu walked away, [Hou Jie] instantly withdrew his smile.
0:15:51|0:16:16|One day, it was drizzling outside. In [Hou Jie]'s courtyard, the rapid gunfire completely drowned out the sound of rain. [Cao Man] was holding a machine gun, shooting wildly at the temporary stone wall in the courtyard. [Hou Jie] sat inside the house, his face dark, lost in thought. When all the bullets were spent, [Cao Man] finally stopped.
0:16:30|0:16:41|The foreigner raised his cane, turned around and looked behind him. [Hou Jie] paid no attention to the foreigner's words, savoring the incense in his hand.
0:16:41|0:16:53|Ming, after finishing the tea, finally raised his head and stared at the foreigner for a long time. [Hou Jie] put down the tea cup in his hand, stood up, and crossed his arms.
0:17:5|0:17:29|[Hou Jie] had just finished speaking when he pointed directly at the foreigner with one hand. Feeling greatly insulted, the foreigner put on his military cap and turned to leave. [Cao Man] quickly stepped forward to stop him, then walked briskly to [Hou Jie]'s side.
0:17:34|0:17:50|[Cao Man] had barely finished speaking when he was grabbed by the collar and pushed against the beam by [Hou Jie]. Peter didn't even want to say a word more, he picked up his cane and left. [Hou Jie] still had an angry look on his face.
0:18:5|0:18:35|[Cao Man] nodded quickly, but [Hou Jie] seemed not to see [Cao Man]'s plea for mercy. His face was even more furious, with a terrifying look of gritted teeth. [Cao Man] had veins popping out at the corners of his eyes, his face turning red. Seeing this, [Hou Jie] slowly released the arm that was choking him. [Cao Man] felt relieved, while [Hou Jie]'s expression darkened once again. [Cao Man] obediently lowered his head.
0:19:7|0:19:34|[Cao Man] was at a loss for words for a moment, nodding in agreement. [Hou Jie] raised his hand and gestured in the air a few times. [Cao Man] looked at [Hou Jie] who was sternly reprimanding him, feeling a bit confused. [Hou Jie] seemed to calm down, and when [Cao Man] heard this, he couldn't help but look up at him, only to see his determined gaze. The next morning, a ripple of green waves rippled through the valley.
0:19:34|0:19:59|By the reed marsh on the bank, there was an empty space with many monks standing on one leg, resembling golden roosters. [Jingkong] felt unwell and quickly adjusted his posture. [Jinghai] looked at him mysteriously.
0:20:44|0:20:52|[Jingkong] was so immersed in the praise that he fell directly from the wooden stake. [Shengnan] paid no attention to the servant and accidentally fell to the ground.
0:21:20|0:21:35|[Hou Jie] took the painting from Sheng Nan's hand, only to see a depiction of [Hou Jie] in military uniform on it, with the words "My dad loves to fight" written next to it. Sheng Nan looked at the painting, and [Hou Jie] affectionately patted his daughter's cheek.
0:21:42|0:22:0|[Hou Jie] turned around at the sound, handed the painting to his daughter, and gestured the actions in the painting, making his daughter burst into laughter. His wife carried their daughter and walked towards the inner room, while [Hou Jie] watched them enter the room before stepping out of the house.
0:22:15|0:22:29|[Hou Jie] listened to [Cao Man]'s report without any expression, only rubbing his lips. After a while, [Hou Jie] stopped thinking, turned his head to look at [Cao Man] standing beside him, only to see [Cao Man] standing straight without any change in expression, calmly accepting [Hou Jie]'s gaze.
0:22:31|0:23:5|[Hou Jie] still stared straight into the eyes of [Cao Man], while [Cao Man] looked earnestly at [Hou Jie]. Then he let out a light whistle, and obediently shook his head. [Hou Jie] spoke out the answer on his own, and with that, he had made up his mind. Seeing this, [Cao Man] did not offer any suggestions, but instead a smile appeared on his face. [Cao Man] continued speaking on his own.
0:23:15|0:23:33|[Cao Man] couldn't help but look at [Hou Jie] again. [Hou Jie] turned his head, placed his hand on [Cao Man]'s shoulder, took a step closer, his face becoming extremely cold and ruthless. [Cao Man] once again showed a smile on his face, respectfully nodded.
0:23:35|0:23:53|Upon returning to the room, [Hou Jie] opened a red wooden box on the table. [Yan Xi] walked over with a worried expression, only to see him lift the white cloth inside the box, revealing two small pistols hidden underneath. [Hou Jie] calmly played with the firearms in his hand, looking at [Yan Xi].
0:24:3|0:24:12|[Hou Jie] has an exceptionally determined look in his eyes, with a hint of helplessness shining through.
0:24:19|0:24:27|[Yan Xi] had a look of helplessness on his face, with tears shimmering in his eyes. His wife's tone gradually became tearful.
0:24:30|0:24:45|[Hou Jie] looked at his delicate wife in front of him, his eyes instantly turning red. But then he suddenly chuckled, turned his head away, and pulled his wife into his arms, gently patting her back to comfort her.
0:24:45|0:25:13|At this moment, a warehouse in Dengfeng City is filled with grain. Shadows flicker outside the windows above the warehouse, moving back and forth. The guards of the warehouse are leaning against the wall, dozing off. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the black-clothed figures on the roof quickly jump down from the window. Their light skills are extraordinary, landing silently. In no time, seven or eight people come down. Only then do the guards yawn and wake up from their drowsiness. Seeing this situation, the black-clothed figures...
0:25:13|0:25:21|Taking out the prepared mouse, gently throwing it towards the guard, the guard is successfully lured away.
0:25:45|0:26:1|The ones who came to steal rice were [Jinghai] and his group. They were seen stealing the rice and quickly carrying bags on their backs across the rooftops of Dengfeng city under the cover of night. With the darkness as their shield, they successfully arrived at the refugee area and distributed the food into small packages to the refugees below.
0:26:1|0:26:5|The sound of the grain landing woke up the refugees who were originally asleep.
0:26:17|0:26:39|Refugees looked ecstatically at the rice in their hands, kneeling and bowing towards the sky. The monks in black robes on the roof watched with a hint of smugness in their eyes. The refugees set up pots and bowls on the spot, lit the fire, and danced in celebration of the gift from the heavens today. Meanwhile, outside the Zhongyue Building, the crowd surged, and countless soldiers surrounded them.
0:26:39|0:26:55|In the building, the sound of festive instrumental music could be heard. The famous songstress Tian'er in the Zhongle Building was singing her most skilled piece. The people who were originally eating suddenly stood up one after another and gathered at the railing. Inside the Zhongle Building, soldiers surrounded the place, with guards stationed at every corner.
0:26:55|0:27:16|Xiao Er quickly ran to close all the private rooms in the building, while at the entrance of the hall stood two rows of bosses in an orderly manner. At this moment, heavy hoofbeats and marching sounds could be heard coming from outside Zhongyue Building. Leading the way was [Cao Man], followed by many soldiers rushing towards Zhongle Building. Behind them, [Hou Jie] and his family were being escorted.
0:27:28|0:27:51|[Hou Jie] indulged in pinching his daughter's nose, then quietly slipped a handgun under [Yan Xi]'s skirt. [Yan Xi] watched [Hou Jie]'s little actions, the worry on her face becoming more serious. The innkeeper bowed obsequiously, welcoming [Hou Jie] and his group in. [Cao Man] tucked his hat under his arm and walked in the front following the innkeeper's direction.
0:27:51|0:27:55|[Hou Jie] and [Yan Xi] walked hand in hand with their daughter, leisurely following behind.
0:27:55|0:28:8|[Yan Xi] looked around with worry and glanced at [Hou Jie] again. [Hou Jie] met [Yan Xi]'s gaze and gave her a reassuring smile. [Song Hu] was already standing at the door of the box with his wife and children, staring thoughtfully at [Hou Jie] and his family.
0:29:36|0:29:41|[Cao Man] slightly bowed to [Hou Jie] to signal, then stared at [Song Hu] carefully until he turned and left.
0:29:41|0:29:47|[Hou Jie] watched as [Cao Man] left, and [Yan Xi] seemed to notice something. She turned her head to look at [Hou Jie].
0:29:47|0:29:55|[Hou Jie] reached out his hand to place it on the table, only to have his hand grabbed in midair by [Song Hu]. [Hou Jie] frowned as he looked at the hand that was caught.
0:30:17|0:30:24|[Hou Jie] no longer stared at [Song Hu], but glanced at the table. He pursed his lips as if pondering something, and then [Hou Jie] pulled his hand out of [Song Hu]'s grasp.
0:31:24|0:31:34|The door was opened, and [Song Hu]'s deputy hurriedly walked over to hand him a note. [Song Hu] put down his wine glass, disdainfully glanced at the deputy, and took his younger brother's secret letter.
0:31:35|0:31:49|After reading the confidential letter, the smile on [Song Hu]'s face gradually faded away. [Hou Jie] glanced at [Song Hu] with a serious expression, only to see [Song Hu] clutching the letter in his hand, pursing his lips and staring at the table, lost in thought.
0:32:2|0:32:21|[Song Hu]'s wife immediately got up and pulled their son, [Yan Xi] looked at [Song Hu] in confusion, then turned to look at [Hou Jie]. [Hou Jie] forced a smile, gestured to [Yan Xi] to escape, [Yan Xi] smirked and quickly stood up. He took Shengnan's hand and walked out in front of everyone's gaze.
0:32:25|0:32:59|Deputy Wang bowed decisively and walked out without looking back. [Hou Jie] remained calm and sat on the side. After Deputy Wang left, he made sure to close the box door tightly. Then he went downstairs with his wife and child. The assassins who were already in ambush quietly approached the box with an axe in hand. Unable to contain his anger, [Song Hu] slammed the secret letter on the table. On the secret letter were the words "General, be careful, [Hou Jie] has set up an ambush," leaving [Hou Jie] speechless for a moment.
0:33:15|0:33:39|Facing the furious [Song Hu], [Hou Jie] suddenly pulled out a gun and shot him in the chest. [Cao Man] sat on the grand chair outside, sneering as he listened to the commotion inside the room. [Hou Jie] still pointed the gun at [Song Hu] and turned to walk towards the door, but two huge axes smashed through the door and windows, forcing [Hou Jie] to sit on the round table. One axe swung across and struck the chest of the deputy, frightening the wife and children who screamed in terror as the deputy fought desperately.
0:33:41|0:34:1|[Song Hu]'s wife desperately holds onto a killer, protecting her two children as they run towards another passage. [Yan Xi] grabs a killer charging towards them, using all her strength to push him into the house. At that moment, the main gate of Zhonglelou suddenly closes. Before the guards could react, they were shot down from all directions. Seeing the reflection in the glass, the gun was out of bullets.
0:34:1|0:34:21|The figure of the killer appeared on the glass again, making [Hou Jie] feel desperate. The killer suddenly fell to the ground, and then [Hou Jie] realized that it was [Song Hu] who fired the last shot for him. [Hou Jie] looked in horror at the body of [Song Hu] on the ground, while [Cao Man] continued to sit on the grandmaster chair, laughing even more joyfully.
0:34:21|0:34:27|[Hou Jie] was about to rush out with a determined look, but the glass was completely shattered, and four assassins rushed in.
0:34:27|0:34:50|[Hou Jie] picked up a chair and smashed it towards the killer. The killer, caught off guard, couldn't defend himself in time. On the escape route, [Yan Xi] and the others also encountered the killer. When Song Hu's wife saw the killer chasing [Sheng Nan], she quickly took her son and fled. [Sheng Nan] was chased by the killer to the outside of Zhongle Building, but accidentally slipped and fell to the ground. A killer grabbed [Yan Xi] from behind, and [Yan Xi] fought back with him.
0:34:50|0:34:55|In the midst of chaos, [Yan Xi] picked up an axe in front of him and swung it wildly to stop the assassin's attack.
0:35:6|0:35:23|[Sheng Nan] cried as she crawled towards [Yan Xi], a carriage rushed towards [Sheng Nan]. [Sheng Nan] stumbled and ran to the other side, while [Yan Xi] swung the axe with all her might but was eventually knocked down by an assassin's hook. A Shaolin disciple in black clothes who distributed food at night came to help.
0:35:23|0:35:33|Directly smash the food in hand towards the killer. Another person pushes with a single palm, hitting the enemy's head directly, then follows through and knocks the enemy down.
0:35:33|0:35:40|With a few swift moves, they quickly took down all the attacking enemies, and hurried to the side of the critically injured [Yan Xi].
0:35:43|0:36:12|At this moment, [Hou Jie] upstairs is still fighting with the assassin. He uses a move called "Scorpion Tail Sweep", kicking the enemy down with one foot, then punches the enemy in the face. Downstairs, [Cao Man] is leisurely drinking tea. Seeing that [Hou Jie] has not been taken down yet, his face becomes very dark. He looks up at Solon Tu next to him. Solon Tu understands [Cao Man]'s meaning and immediately dodges the assassin's axe. [Hou Jie] avoids the axe coming towards him and slaps him on the head.
0:36:12|0:36:21|[Hou Jie] dodged another axe without hesitation, knocked him down with an elbow, and all the killers in front of him were wiped out. [Hou Jie] quickly ran towards the outside of the building.
0:36:21|0:36:32|Who knew that Sulongtu unexpectedly rushed out from the other side, only to see [Hou Jie] take the lead and leap through the window. Without hesitation, [Hou Jie] quickly got up and ran towards the scaffolding on the side.
0:36:32|0:36:48|Zoltan quickly caught up with [Hou Jie] from the side and kicked towards him. [Hou Jie] was seen pulling a wire and falling heavily to the ground. His deputy sensed something was wrong and hurried upstairs to search. At this moment, Zoltan was chasing after [Hou Jie] frantically.
0:36:55|0:37:13|Watching as [Hou Jie] was about to be caught up, [Hou Jie]'s deputy suddenly appeared at the side window and fired a shot at [Solontu]. Enraged, [Solontu] dragged the deputy out of the window, and the two fell heavily to the ground. [Solontu] then turned around, clamped his legs tightly around the deputy's head, and twisted it fiercely, ending his life.
0:37:13|0:37:40|At this moment, [Hou Jie] leaped down from a height and kicked the assassin behind [Cao Man]. Unexpectedly, [Cao Man] was hit and sent flying by a speeding carriage at the intersection. The driver of the carriage, who was also an assassin, attacked him. With a fierce expression, [Hou Jie] raised his axe and charged towards them. With one powerful swing, he killed one assassin on the spot, then quickly ran to check on [Cao Man].
0:37:41|0:37:55|Only to see countless carriages holding torches coming towards them, [Hou Jie] dodged the killer's carriage. With [Cao Man] severely injured, he headed towards the city gate. He desperately shook the reins, wishing the carriage could fly, with the killers hot on his heels.
0:37:55|0:38:21|They raised their axes and shouted as they drove the horse carriage galloping behind [Hou Jie]. [Hou Jie] held his daughter in one hand and swung the reins harder with the other hand. More and more assassins emerged from various streets and alleys, driving carriages to chase after [Hou Jie]. [Hou Jie] drove the carriage straight through a pavilion, only to have it collapse from the impact. The assassins following closely behind were blocked by the falling wooden stakes and tiles from the pavilion.
0:38:21|0:38:44|[Hou Jie] ran all the way, creating obstacles as he went. He could be seen reaching out his arm on the carriage to knock down the nest on the roadside, directly covering the assassins behind him. Countless carriages poured out from all directions, following [Hou Jie] closely. Soon they chased onto a piece of open ground outside the city, with [Hou Jie] driving the carriage in the lead and an endless stream of assassins rushing from behind.
0:38:44|0:38:47|The spirited horse galloped swiftly, kicking up clouds of dust.
0:38:47|0:38:57|The group of assassins on the carriage were in high spirits, holding torches and axes high. Soon, the assassins' carriage caught up with [Hou Jie] and surrounded it.
0:38:59|0:39:5|An assassin threw an axe from behind at [Hou Jie], who dodged it and the axe got stuck directly on the carriage.
0:39:5|0:39:23|[Hou Jie] took the opportunity to pick up the axe and swung it horizontally backwards. The assassin couldn't dodge in time and was directly chopped off the carriage. The carriage behind ran over the assassin accidentally, causing numerous carriages to stumble and fall to the ground. Only [Solontu] chased after them, and the two drove the carriage to the edge of the cliff.
0:39:23|0:39:29|When the road widened a bit, [Solontu] squeezed into the inside of the road, forcing [Hou Jie] to the edge of the cliff.
0:39:29|0:39:39|[Sulontu]'s carriage quickly drove alongside [Hou Jie] on the narrow path, attempting to push [Hou Jie] off the cliff. [Hou Jie] quickly pulled the reins tight, trying to escape the predicament.
0:39:39|0:40:3|[Soltu] copied the axe from the carriage and swept it towards him. [Hou Jie] quickly dodged to the side. [Soltu] stabilized his body and struck at [Hou Jie] again. Unable to dodge in time, [Hou Jie] quickly raised his arm to block. [Soltu] took advantage of the situation, trapping [Hou Jie] between two carriages. Using his huge axe, [Soltu] hooked onto [Hou Jie]'s arm and dragged him swiftly along the ground.
0:40:4|0:40:11|Shengnan's carriage could no longer withstand the turmoil, chains fell off one after another, and the horses and carriage broke apart.
0:40:11|0:40:34|[Hou Jie] swung the fallen iron chain towards [Solontu], finally temporarily pulling the two carriages apart. Surprisingly, Shengnan's carriage headed towards a fork in the road leading to the edge of a cliff. [Hou Jie] endured the pain, escaped from [Solontu]'s giant axe, and quickly ran towards Shengnan's carriage. [Hou Jie] rushed to the edge of the cliff at maximum speed, then leaped directly towards Shengnan's carriage.
0:40:34|0:41:0|He tightly held Shengnan in his arms and rolled to the side, the carriage had already fallen off the cliff, descending along the cliff to the bottom. [Hou Jie] paid no attention to the protruding rocks on the steep slope, only protecting Shengnan in his arms. Seeing [Hou Jie] and Shengnan rolling further away, [Suolongtu] quickly stopped the carriage at the edge of the cliff. He leaped off the carriage and walked quickly to the edge of the cliff to check the traces of the two. The bottom of the cliff was deep and there was no sign of [Hou Jie] and Shengnan.
0:41:0|0:41:22|[Cao Man] gave the order, and [Solontu] dared not disobey. After observing for a long time, he snorted coldly, turned around, stepped onto the carriage, and drove away. Unexpectedly, there was a recess in the cliff, where [Hou Jie] was holding Shengnan tightly in his arms. The two were hiding closely together. At this moment, Shengnan's face was pale, showing no trace of color, not knowing if her injuries were too severe, unable to stop trembling.
0:41:22|0:41:37|The senior brothers who delivered supplies to Dengfeng City have finally returned to Shaolin Temple. They sneakily investigate the room for clues, then knock on the door, quickly retreat, and as candles are lit in the room, the door opens and [Jingneng] walks out.
0:41:37|0:41:46|Only [Yan Xi] was seen leaning against a pillar in the room, as [Jing Neng] looked around, two figures in black carrying sacks were seen crossing over the roof.
0:41:46|0:41:55|Disappearing from sight, [Jing Neng] looked thoughtfully at the ceiling, then shifted his gaze to the unconscious [Yan Xi]. At this moment
0:41:55|0:42:20|[Hou Jie] held Sheng Nan, still huddled on the cliff, among the rocks. Sheng Nan's eyes were tightly closed, her body trembling constantly. Suddenly, a melodious bell rang from a distance, catching [Hou Jie]'s attention. He couldn't help but follow the sound, and as the sun rose, rays of sunlight fell on the golden roof of the Shaolin Temple. Although there were no pilgrims inside the temple, incense still lingered in the air.
0:42:38|0:42:52|[Hou Jie] held the seriously injured Sheng Nan in his arms, [Jing Neng] suppressed his fierce expression, quickly took Sheng Nan from [Hou Jie]'s arms, and ran to the nearby desk. [Jing Neng] opened the acupuncture kit, tore open Sheng Nan's clothes, and carefully applied the Guanyin ointment to Sheng Nan's wound.
0:43:5|0:43:27|[Yan Xi] fell to the ground in a panic, struggling to run towards the main hall. As the silver needle went deeper, Shengnan groaned, then suddenly she breathed a sigh of relief. Blood kept flowing from her mouth. [Jing Neng] realized the seriousness of the situation, immediately grabbed [Jing Kong]'s hand and had him support Shengnan's head, while she herself crossed her hands and pressed down on Shengnan's chest.
0:43:27|0:43:34|[Hou Jie] looked at his unconscious daughter and then blankly raised his head to look at [Jing Neng].
0:46:9|0:46:20|[Yan Xi], in extreme anger, slapped [Hou Jie] to the ground. Overwhelmed with sadness, she sat on the ground crying. The couple then crawled back to their daughter, [Yan Xi] holding her and crying uncontrollably.
0:46:40|0:46:53|[Hou Jie] had just finished speaking when he raised his hand and swept towards [Abbot], who raised his hand to block his attack. [Hou Jie] had become frenzied at this point, grabbing a monk and striking him relentlessly.
0:46:58|0:47:12|[Jing Neng] had just finished speaking when five monks all brandished their staffs and advanced, the Shaolin staffs dancing straight towards [Hou Jie]. [Hou Jie] roared and charged at the monks with staffs in hand. Just as he reached the monks, his advance was halted by a flurry of staffs. A monk from behind tightly locked his waist with a Shaolin staff.
0:47:23|0:47:54|[Hou Jie], supported by a heart full of resentment, finally collapsed due to exhaustion. [Yan Xi] looked at her husband, who was raving mad and unconscious, and bent down to hold Shengnan, crying again. Then the monks placed the unconscious [Hou Jie] in the second-floor scripture pavilion of the shop for care. A monk slowly approached him with a plate, then placed the herbal soup from the plate beside him and soaked a clean towel in the basin.
0:47:54|0:48:12|[Hou Jie] lay motionless there, surrounded by scriptures and ancient books, with a statue of the Buddha Shakyamuni that was as tall as the scripture hall, still calmly gazing at all living beings. Days passed like this, and life in the Shaolin Temple gradually returned to tranquility.
0:48:12|0:48:34|After an unknown period of time, [Hou Jie] lying in the scripture pavilion gradually began to react. His fingers curled slightly, his legs also started to move. He suddenly opened his eyes, staring straight at the ceiling of the scripture pavilion. It took [Hou Jie] a long time to figure out what had happened to him. He struggled to move his body and turn his head.
0:48:34|0:48:55|Surveying the unfamiliar surroundings, not knowing what attracted him, he reached for a knife by the bed and grasped it firmly. Leaving the scripture hall, the sound of random hacking and chopping could be heard coming from the grass on the back mountain of Shaolin Temple. It was [Hou Jie] wandering aimlessly in the grass, slashing and chopping indiscriminately.
0:49:11|0:49:18|Wudao looked at the last piece of straw in his hand, hesitated for a moment, blinked, and then defiantly threw the last piece of straw aside.
0:49:27|0:49:43|Wudao carried the Shaolin staff and walked through the weeds to the pit he had dug. He saw [Hou Jie] struggling to stand up, as if he had injured his leg, [Hou Jie] was in a sorry state.
0:49:58|0:50:11|Wudao shook his head towards the pit where [Hou Jie] was, then turned and left the pit. At this moment, [Hou Jie] was deeply trapped in it, looking very embarrassed. He dragged his injured leg, enduring the pain, and curled up in a corner.
0:50:11|0:50:17|In the early morning, the monks of Shaolin Temple rang the drum, announcing the arrival of a new day.
0:50:17|0:50:41|At this moment, [Hou Jie] had been lying in the pit all night, ignored by everyone. Wu Dao arrived at the pit early in the morning and threw a piece of paper towards [Hou Jie]. It turned out to be a wanted poster with [Hou Jie]'s portrait on it, offering a reward of up to 50,000 silver dollars. The bright red seal of [Cao Man] stood out, making [Hou Jie]'s veins on his forehead bulge, while his eyes were empty and lifeless.
0:50:41|0:51:6|Wudao walked slowly to the edge of the pit, holding a lantern in one hand and a cloth bag in the other. He looked down, dropped two sweet potatoes, chuckled to himself, muttered something, then turned and left the pit. [Hou Jie] still lay motionless at the bottom of the pit, his eyes empty and unfocused.
0:51:6|0:51:30|Late at night, the weeds around the pit swayed in the wind, [Hou Jie] lay alone at the bottom of the pit gazing up at the starry sky, motionless like a corpse, eyes wide open, [Hou Jie] stared fixedly at the night sky, living a lonely life in this pit.
0:51:32|0:51:57|At this moment, [Hou Jie] has been rescued from the pit by Wudao and placed in the mess hall. He sits blankly against the door frame, staring into the distance with empty eyes. Wudao walks slowly towards him with a bowl of plain noodles, placing it in [Hou Jie]'s hands. [Hou Jie] takes the noodles without any reaction, still staring blankly ahead. As if coming back to his senses, [Hou Jie] slowly lifts the chopsticks and brings a strand of noodles to his mouth.
0:52:25|0:52:46|[Hou Jie] seemed to not hear the words of enlightenment, eating the noodles faster and faster. However, the two lines of tears betrayed his emotions. [Hou Jie] stopped chewing, picked up the noodles again, and stuffed them into his mouth absentmindedly.
0:52:46|0:53:14|Seemingly pouring endless emotions into eating noodles, he appeared to regain composure, burying his head expressionlessly to finish the last strand of noodles. The bowl covered his face, but not his emotions. A suppressed sob escaped from behind the bowl, with tears streaming down his reddened eyes. Inside the [Hou Jie] mansion, the portrait of [Hou Jie] was carelessly thrown on the ground, while soldiers smashed open lockboxes and rifled through documents on the shelves.
0:53:14|0:53:34|Scattered items from the drawer were poured onto the table again, as [Hou Jie]'s deputy knelt on the ground, looking at [Cao Man] sitting across from him.
0:54:6|0:54:19|As soon as the deputy officer spoke, he tried to kill [Cao Man], but was kicked away by [Solontu].
0:54:20|0:54:34|[Cao Man] easily clamped down on the arm of the deputy officer, forcibly breaking it. He then hooked the deputy officer's head with his hand and twisted it towards himself, dragging the deputy officer along.
0:54:44|0:54:58|[Cao Man] once again broke the other arm of the deputy with a backhand, kicked him out of the house with one foot, and the deputy struggled for a few moments before losing his breath. At this moment, [Hou Jie] was unaware that another group of soldiers loyal to him had already died for him.
0:54:58|0:55:15|He sat in the mess hall, holding tightly the urn containing Shengnan's ashes, with the painting she had specially drawn for him in his hand. The painting was now tattered and covered in blood.
0:55:26|0:55:33|The expression on [Wudao]'s face was filled with disbelief.
0:55:40|0:56:12|[Hou Jie] finally made a move, he looked up and glanced at Wudao. [Hou Jie] seemed to ignore Wudao's words, and he walked straight to the stove with Shengnan's urn in his arms. He gently placed Shengnan's urn on the stove, and after a while, his eyes gradually became firm. He reached out and picked up the scissors on the stove, tried to cut a few times, then grabbed a strand of his own hair and decisively cut it off. Wudao saw that [Hou Jie] was ignoring him for a long time.
0:56:12|0:56:39|Unable to resist, [Wudao] walked over to check on [Hou Jie]'s movements. [Hou Jie] paid no attention to him, still holding the scissors and cutting his hair randomly. [Wudao] did not stop him, casually leaning against a nearby shelf with his hands crossed over his chest, watching [Hou Jie]. As [Hou Jie] cut faster and faster, more and more hair fell off, scattering around Shengnan's urn.
0:56:39|0:56:58|As time passed, [Hou Jie]'s hair became increasingly sparse, but his movements did not slow down at all. In fact, from the moment he started cutting with the scissors, there was no hesitation. Wu Dao leaned against the side, his playful expression finally becoming serious, causing a slight smile to appear on his face.
0:56:58|0:57:26|The Buddha said, hair represents the countless worries and bad habits in the world, shaving the head means removing these worries and bad habits. At the same time, shaving the head also symbolizes getting rid of worldly pride, arrogance, and attachments, focusing on cultivation and enlightenment. Slowly, [Hou Jie] walked up to him, carefully admiring the messy haircut he had given him. Inside the Shaolin Temple, the monks were busy cleaning the Buddha hall.
0:57:27|0:57:52|[Jingneng] suddenly appeared in the Buddha hall, clasped his hands together and bowed to the Buddha statue. The kitchen suddenly had a lot of rice. He quickly turned to [Jingkong], who dared not speak. [Jinghai] reached out and pulled [Jingneng] to bow to the Buddha behind him.
0:58:8|0:58:14|[Jing Neng] looked at the two people in front of him with a knowing expression, only to realize that he had misspoken. He lowered his head awkwardly.
0:58:20|0:58:48|[Hou Jie] has shaved his head, wearing a coarse linen robe, kneeling straight at the entrance of the main hall of Shaolin Temple. Seeing [Hou Jie] in this appearance, passing monks couldn't help but feel surprised. [Hou Jie] remained unmoved. [Jing Neng] heard the sound and walked out of the main hall, saying "Amitabha, Master." All the disciples stepped back, leaving a clear path for [Abbot].
0:59:15|0:59:28|[Abbot] seemed to be moved, took a step forward, but was stopped by [Pure Energy], the Shaolin disciples were all unwilling.
0:59:34|0:59:44|[Jing Neng]'s gaze remains sharp,
1:0:5|1:0:14|[Hou Jie] had tears shimmering in his eyes as he bowed his head deeply,
1:0:25|1:0:46|[Wudao] lifted four huge bamboo baskets high, walking outside the temple with [Hou Jie] and a group of young monks. The baskets were filled with steaming hot steam, and the fallen plaque of the world's martial arts master had been rehung. [Hou Jie] was carrying nothing but the four big characters, still hanging high. He looked up at the plaque a few times.
1:0:52|1:1:14|[Hou Jie] carefully placed the cage on the table set up by the monk, in front of which were already crowded with refugees. [Hou Jie] just stood there blankly, without any other actions. Seeing this, [Wu Dao] opened the cage, grabbed [Hou Jie]'s hand and reached into the cage, took out the steamed bun and handed it to the refugees. The refugees who received the steamed bun nodded and bowed to express their thanks, [Hou Jie] smiled and took the initiative to distribute the steamed buns to the refugees.
1:1:15|1:1:49|In the martial arts training ground on the back hill of the Shaolin Temple, [Jingneng] is leading a group of monks in practicing martial arts. The monks' movements are uniform and clean, with [Jingneng] at the front demonstrating a set of clean and crisp boxing techniques for his junior brothers. As he explains the essentials of the boxing techniques, [Jingneng] earnestly demonstrates the corresponding moves. The disciples are learning [Jingneng]'s boxing techniques in a uniform and orderly manner. [Hou Jie] stands quietly in the pile of weeds, watching the monks' boxing techniques.
1:1:49|1:2:2|The sound of fists breaking through the air could be heard, the momentum in the martial arts arena was exceptionally grand. [Jingneng] took the lead in changing various moves, and the other monks followed him closely, without any sense of dragging or hesitation.
1:2:2|1:2:22|After practicing boxing, the monks were divided into three groups. One group focused on consolidating their boxing skills, another group practiced on sandbags, with the monks stepping into a horse stance and striking the sandbags in front of them with a single hand. The third group practiced palm strikes, with the monks standing firmly in a horse stance and continuously striking the wooden stakes in front of them. [Master Jingneng] walked around the martial arts field with his hands behind his back.
1:2:22|1:2:35|[Master Jingneng] carefully checked the practice of his junior disciples. When he saw [Hou Jie] standing by the pile of weeds watching them practice, [Master Jingneng]'s expression became even more stern. Sensing [Master Jingneng]'s gaze, [Hou Jie] lowered his head and walked away.
1:2:35|1:3:2|In the kitchen, Wudao danced with a huge iron pot, causing the food to toss and fly in the air. Wudao stirred the food with a shovel, and [Hou Jie] watched the cheerful Wudao and couldn't help but smile. Wudao effortlessly lifted the large iron pot and placed it on the table on the other side. The novice monk had already placed a wooden barrel under the table, and then Wudao took out a huge ball of dough.
1:3:2|1:3:14|Kneading on the cutting board, he lifted the dough high and slammed it back down, then propped his arms on the dough and forcefully pulled it apart, displaying various fancy kneading techniques. [Hou Jie] watched in astonishment at the skillful kneading movements.
1:3:29|1:3:36|[Hou Jie] couldn't help but laugh at the casual tone of Wudao's words.
1:3:53|1:4:8|After speaking, Wudao used the skills of making pancakes, kneading the dough. Hou Jie came to his senses, pondering Wudao's words. From then on, there was a new figure of studying in the scripture pavilion. Hou Jie found his new direction through contemplation.
1:4:8|1:4:16|From then on, [Hou Jie] never let go of the Chinese and Japanese Buddhist scriptures, and whenever he had free time, he would come to the scripture repository to read.
1:4:16|1:4:39|Apart from daily reciting Buddhist scriptures, [Hou Jie] also practices martial arts in his spare time at the dance studio. He stands with a steady horse stance, his hands alternately striking the sandbag. He focuses intently on each movement, showing no signs of fatigue. However, he knows that the Shaolin disciples still have prejudices against him. Therefore, [Hou Jie] always sneaks in to practice when the martial arts field is empty.
1:4:39|1:4:45|Suddenly, [Jing Neng] ran with a group of disciples to the martial arts field and collided head-on with [Hou Jie].
1:4:45|1:5:7|[Hou Jie] looked at the figure getting closer, sighed, picked up the clothes beside him, wiped the sweat off his face, and walked towards [Jing Neng] who was coming. He still had no expression on his face. The other disciples avoided [Hou Jie] and ran forward without looking sideways. [Jing Kong] was the first to stop, smiling at [Hou Jie]. [Hou Jie] kept his head down and ignored [Jing Kong].
1:5:7|1:5:16|Until he saw [Jingneng] standing in front of him, he had to stop, look up, and [Jinghai] also stopped, motionless for a long time.
1:5:16|1:5:26|[Hou Jie] stood in the middle of the three people, looked around in astonishment, [Jing Neng] sincerely looked at [Hou Jie], then turned and ran into the martial arts training ground.
1:5:48|1:5:58|[Hou Jie] earnestly clapped his hands, a long-lost smile appeared on his face. From then on, he officially became a member of the Shaolin Temple, able to openly appear in the martial arts training ground and practice with other disciples.
1:6:4|1:6:15|Despite focusing on martial arts training, [Hou Jie] still distributes food to refugees with Wudao. Accidents occasionally occur in the refugee camp, and [Hou Jie] is always on hand to move the injured.
1:6:15|1:6:19|During the rescue of refugees by [Fangzhang], [Hou Jie] also carefully accompanies him, pinching his philtrum.
1:6:20|1:6:35|Days passed by, [Hou Jie] gradually adapted to the life in the Shaolin Temple. Inside the martial arts hall, the sounds of punches and shouts could be heard. [Hou Jie] sat in front of the desk, holding a Buddhist scripture and studying it carefully.
1:6:42|1:6:58|A child, pushed by his friends, awkwardly handed a steamed bun to [Hou Jie], then ran away without a trace. [Hou Jie] smiled as he took a bite of the steamed bun, feeling an unprecedented satisfaction. He held the bun in his mouth and started to tap the wheel more seriously.
1:6:58|1:7:9|In the dead of night, the temple was quiet and silent. A pair of feet stepped on the bamboo ladder, with a bucket hanging beside. [Hou Jie] was seen lying on the plaque, earnestly wiping the characters he had written up.
1:7:9|1:7:21|He carefully washes the cloth in his hands after each wipe, then stands up again to vigorously scrub the plaque with the cloth. By now, he truly sees himself as a member of the Shaolin Temple.
1:7:22|1:7:44|It's late at night, a young novice monk is practicing martial arts diligently in front of the bell tower. Despite his young age, every move he makes is well-structured. [Hou Jie] steps onto the steps and looks at the young novice monk practicing martial arts in the middle of the night with some surprise. The young novice monk doesn't notice [Hou Jie]'s arrival, he continues to practice his martial arts meticulously. [Hou Jie] kneels in front of the young novice monk.
1:7:44|1:7:51|Gently holding his arms, [Ma Dongmei] looks at him tenderly.
1:7:59|1:8:26|[Hou Jie] unhesitatingly wiped the little novice monk's runny nose with his hand. [Hou Jie] and the little novice monk positioned themselves in front of the bell tower, they both took a deep breath and exhaled, smoothly executing the first move after the starting posture. They then closed their legs, bent their knees into a half-squat stance, with their legs forming a right bow stance, the left fist punching forward, and the right fist hugging the waist. They were performing the signature boxing technique of Shaolin Seven Star Fist, the Seven Star Fist.
1:8:26|1:8:40|The Seven Star Fist is practiced with movements like a cat and actions like a tiger. Its techniques are composed of its unique walking steps, which also serve as a standard to test the depth of a Shaolin martial artist's kung fu when practicing Shaolin boxing techniques.
1:8:40|1:8:49|At this moment, [Hou Jie] followed Xiaoshami more and more naturally in his movements, acting from the heart. He no longer showed his former sternness, but instead radiated a brilliant smile.
1:8:49|1:8:58|The gentle light from the clock tower falls on the silhouettes of two people, [Abbot] and Wudao, standing on a high platform, quietly enjoying this beautiful scene.
1:10:0|1:10:33|[Abbot] did not enlighten the disciples, but instead smiled and looked at the two people practicing boxing in the distance. The disciple raised his head to look at the night sky, as if contemplating something. Then he pursed his lips and raised the corners of his mouth, also earnestly watching [Hou Jie] and the others. At this moment, [Hou Jie] was completely focused, not underestimating a young monk as usual, but following him seriously in every punch. As they finished the set of punches with the final move, they turned and retracted their right foot into a horse stance.
1:10:33|1:10:39|With the left hand protecting the jaw and the right hand protecting the crotch, they then smiled at each other.
1:11:4|1:11:12|Commander Gao smiled and nodded in agreement with Commander Wang's words, then turned to look at [Cao Man].
1:11:32|1:11:46|[Cao Man] leaned against the water tank, Commander Tang angrily got up and walked towards the outside of the house. Seeing this, Commander Wang took the hat from his subordinate and also stood up to walk outside. Commander Gao snorted coldly and also stood up.
1:11:46|1:11:53|[Cao Man] remained unmoved. Just as a few warlords approached the main gate, they were blocked by [Solontu] and a Mongolian man.
1:11:53|1:11:59|The Mongolian man made a cunning move with his fists and feet, leaving [the warlord] struggling to defend himself.
1:11:59|1:12:6|The Mongolian man kicked a [warlord], sending him flying more than 10 meters away, leaving the other [warlords] too scared to move.
1:12:26|1:12:58|[Warlords] stood in the center of the hall, not daring to move, each gripping the ground. [Cao Man] lifted his head and looked at the foreign military officer sitting steadily on the side with a smile that was not a smile. The foreigner nodded and smiled back at him. [Cao Man] smirked. It was already late at night, and there was a sound of crying in the refugee camp. [Jing Neng] and [Hou Jie] hurried over with their utensils upon hearing the crying.
1:13:13|1:13:26|[Jing Neng] subconsciously looked at [Hou Jie] with a questioning look in his eyes. [Hou Jie] glanced back at [Jing Neng], then lowered his eyes to the crying refugees, trembling as he took a deep breath.
1:13:29|1:13:51|In the pitch-black bamboo forest, a group of refugees are gathered here, digging something. [Hou Jie] appears silently in a corner of the bamboo forest, carefully investigating the situation in front of him. He witnesses a horrifying scene, as he sees a large pit not far away filled with the bodies of the refugees, all men, scattered and thrown around inside the pit.
1:13:51|1:14:9|[Hou Jie] couldn't bear to watch any longer. He averted his gaze and looked to the other side, where several soldiers were pacing back and forth with guns, monitoring the refugees working in the fields. One of the soldiers aimed his gun at [Hou Jie].
1:14:25|1:14:47|Several soldiers were obviously scared out of their wits by [Hou Jie], dropping their guns and fleeing from the bamboo forest. [Hou Jie] took off his hat, looking blankly at the fleeing soldiers. The rest of the refugees then realized what was happening and quickly dropped their hoes, following the leader in running away. The leader ran up to [Hou Jie],
1:15:0|1:15:24|[Cao Man] later gathered all the refugees and locked them up in a wooden cage. He raised a machine gun without hesitation and started shooting at the cage. The refugees had nowhere to hide, only able to hug their heads and scream before falling down. [Hou Jie], after suddenly hearing the refugees' pleas, was unable to come back to his senses for a long time.
1:15:31|1:15:54|Hou Jie watched as the refugees ran past him, unable to resist turning back to look at the group of survivors. It was late at night. Most of the people in the refugee camp had already fallen asleep, with only a faint glow from a street lamp outside the tents. Hou Jie struggled to pull a cart, neatly stacked with rows of bodies. The cart finally arrived at the entrance of the camp, as Hou Jie carefully
1:15:54|1:15:58|Taking off the straps on the shoulders, [Ma Dongmei] carefully parked the cart by the roadside.
1:15:58|1:16:19|In a nearby tent, an old lady came out with a worn square basin to pour water. She turned around inadvertently and only saw the neatly stacked bodies on the cart. The old lady stood still, the basin in her hand slipped silently. Suddenly she came to her senses and rushed towards the cart. [Hou Jie] stood blankly on the side, then quickly lowered his head.
1:16:22|1:16:51|Hearing the sound, numerous netizens rushed out of the tents towards the cart. Many refugees found the bodies of their loved ones on the cart, and the sound of crying echoed through the night sky. The [Jingneng] brothers could only stand quietly by the roadside, watching this scene. An old lady wailed and collapsed on the ground, her husband unable to lift her up. [Hou Jie] stood blankly on the side, seemingly feeling the gaze of the [Jingneng] brothers, and stiffly turned around.
1:16:51|1:17:11|[Hou Jie] lowered his head and walked straight through [Jingneng] and [Jinghai], returning to Shaolin Temple alone. [Jingneng] and the other two looked worried and turned around simultaneously. They put their hands together and bowed their heads, silently reciting the Heart Sutra to help the innocent refugees who died tragically. The words of the abbot echoed in [Hou Jie]'s ears once again.
1:17:36|1:17:46|[Abbot] would strike [Hou Jie]'s shoulder with a ruler after each sentence he recited.
1:17:55|1:18:12|[Hou Jie] lowered his head, and the cruel image of him pressing [Cao Man] against the beam column reappeared in front of his eyes. A glint of tears flashed in [Hou Jie]'s eyes.
1:18:20|1:18:26|Tears finally rolled down the face of [Hou Jie],
1:18:37|1:19:9|Shaolin disciples gathered in the main hall, with their hands clasped together. [Hou Jie] knelt on a cushion, hands facing upwards, respectfully bowing before the Buddha statue. He then stood up, clasped his hands together again, and bowed before the Buddha statue once more. The peaceful days did not last long, as the Shaolin Temple once again faced unexpected visitors. A large group of people and horses, full of hostility, headed straight for the Shaolin Temple. With the iron cavalry of the officials, the refugees fled in panic, scattering in all directions.
1:19:9|1:19:21|Hearing the sound, the four brothers [Jingneng] rushed to the window of the scripture pavilion, only to see refugees pouring into the Shaolin Temple, dragging their families and helping each other, filling every corner of the Shaolin Temple.
1:19:21|1:19:36|In addition, the soldiers played with the refugees like cats playing with mice, driving them towards the Shaolin Temple. At the rear of the army, [Cao Man] and [Solontu] rode on horseback.
1:19:40|1:19:47|[Abbot] stood aside persuading the two junior brothers brought back by [Pure Energy], while [Hou Jie] calmly walked towards his three senior brothers.
1:20:2|1:20:12|[Hou Jie] faced the abbot, respectfully bowing his head and placing one hand in front of his chest.
1:20:12|1:20:28|Several senior brothers also rushed towards [Hou Jie]. With hands clasped together, [Jing Neng] looked steadily at [Hou Jie], suddenly reached out and struck. [Hou Jie] instinctively raised his hand to block, but his arm was grabbed by [Jing Neng]. [Jing Hai] and [Jing Kong] placed their hands on the back of [Jing Neng]'s hand, the determination in their eyes was evident.
1:20:28|1:20:45|[Cao Man] led his troops to ride horses recklessly into the main hall of Shaolin Temple. The soldiers, on horseback, pointed their guns at the Shaolin disciples. The monks raised their Shaolin staffs without fear and bravely rushed to the front to defend against the invaders. One soldier was knocked off his horse by a Shaolin staff.
1:20:45|1:21:12|[Suo Longtu] saw the situation and took the reins to walk forward. He lightly stepped on the horse's back, leaped up, and swooped down in front of a group of monks holding Shaolin sticks. His martial arts skills were extremely skillful, kicking down several people with a flying kick. [Cao Man] squinted and looked at the two people coming down the stairs. [Hou Jie] calmly followed the abbot down the stairs, and the Shaolin disciples quickly put away their sticks, respectfully looking towards the abbot.
1:21:12|1:21:42|[Cao Man] also leaped off the horse and walked forward casually. [Jingkong] had long been fed up with [Cao Man]'s arrogant demeanor and was about to charge forward, but was stopped by [Jingneng]. [Hou Jie] calmly walked up to [Cao Man], and suddenly slapped [Cao Man] across the face, causing him to stagger. After a moment of confusion, [Cao Man] turned his head and smiled at [Hou Jie].
1:21:51|1:22:0|[Cao Man] smiled, but there was a hint of gloom in his eyes. [Hou Jie] looked up and smiled at [Cao Man].
1:22:13|1:22:30|[Cao Man] who saw through your thoughts had already lost his previous good mood, he suddenly punched [Hou Jie]. [Hou Jie] did not fight back, he still clasped his hands together, took a deep breath to ease the pain.
1:22:37|1:23:15|[Jingneng] covered the mouths of two junior brothers, reprimanding them sternly. [Jingkong] felt unwilling in his heart, but had to nod. [Caoman] walked slowly to [Houjie], who did not evade. [Caoman] slapped his own chest, his expression finally becoming fierce. [Houjie] slowly lifted his head. Not wanting to entangle further with [Houjie], [Caoman] arrogantly watched as [Houjie] took a few steps back and began to look around.
1:23:15|1:23:44|[Cao Man] took a few steps towards the other side and stood in front of the abbot. Facing [Cao Man]'s fierce gaze, the abbot remained fearless and looked at him calmly. The abbot then shifted his gaze to [Hou Jie], who understood the abbot's intention and respectfully bowed to him.
1:23:44|1:23:53|Abbot's frankness and lack of pretense seemed to irk [Cao Man], but he just pursed his lips, glared fiercely at the abbot, and turned away.
1:23:53|1:24:1|Cao Man stood in front of [Hou Jie] again, made a gesture of invitation towards him, and [Hou Jie] slightly nodded before resolutely walking forward.
1:24:2|1:24:16|The national treasure has been packed into the wooden box as scheduled, the foreign military officer pointed angrily at [Cao Man]'s nose, telling him not to be so arrogant.
1:24:21|1:24:45|The foreign officer disdainfully glanced at [Cao Man], then turned and walked out of the Cao residence. Inside the residence, as things were bustling, the Shaolin disciples had also arrived. [Jingkong] was the first to cautiously peek out from the roof, watching the soldiers below. He cursed under his breath as he herded a large group of refugees into the courtyard of the Cao residence. These refugees had heavy chains binding their feet together.
1:24:45|1:24:52|[Caoman] could only move forward with great difficulty, and saw a huge two-story wooden cage prison being built in the inner courtyard.
1:24:53|1:24:58|[Hou Jie] is facing a shiny golden dragon throne.
1:25:28|1:26:1|[Hou Jie] sighed helplessly, turned around and patted [Cao Man]'s shoulder. He looked into [Cao Man]'s eyes seriously, without a hint of disdain. [Cao Man] looked back at [Hou Jie], with a hint of confusion and bitterness in his eyes. [Hou Jie] grabbed the back of [Cao Man]'s neck, and [Cao Man] seemed to listen. He nodded with his eyes closed, and instantly reverted to his previous arrogant demeanor.
1:26:2|1:26:33|[Cao Man] kicked him onto the dragon throne in front of him, [Cao Man] raised a foot and pressed it on [Hou Jie]'s neck, [Hou Jie] couldn't move for a while, [Suolongtu] walked into the hall with several soldiers, carrying a wooden cage in his hands. Inside the wooden cage was the heavily injured [Yan Xi]. [Yan Xi] groaned in pain for a few moments, finally opening his eyes slightly. [Hou Jie] finally came to his senses, his slightly trembling shoulders betraying his heartache, outside the courtyard.
1:26:33|1:26:42|Two monks holding Shaolin staffs somersaulted off the roof and quietly hid under a carriage. Countless soldiers patrolled back and forth, but they didn't see them at all.
1:26:42|1:27:9|The other two monks quietly descended from the eaves. [Cao Man] opened the cage, grabbed [Yan Xi] by the hair, and forcibly dragged her up. [Yan Xi] helplessly twisted [Cao Man]'s hand. [Cao Man] lifted [Yan Xi] directly, dragged her out of the cage and threw her on the ground. [Hou Jie] walked towards [Yan Xi] with a heartache. [Yan Xi] raised her head, propped herself up and looked at [Hou Jie].
1:27:11|1:27:35|The soldier rudely shoved the last refugee into the cage and locked the top door. [Jing Neng] and his junior brothers remained crouched on the roof of the inner courtyard, waiting for the best moment to break in. At this moment, [Hou Jie] had calmed himself down and walked calmly towards [Yan Xi]. [Cao Man] watched as [Hou Jie] approached, leisurely sitting on a chair, while [Yan Xi] looked up.
1:27:35|1:27:55|With unwavering gaze, [Hou Jie] knelt slowly in front of [Yan Xi] as the monk approached him. Tears glistened in his eyes as he gently helped [Yan Xi] up, who then knelt on his arm without hesitation, shaking his head firmly while still staring at [Hou Jie].
1:28:6|1:28:19|Perhaps thinking of his innocent daughter who had died tragically, [Yan Xi] closed his eyes in pain. [Hou Jie] looked sadly at his wife, who was covered in bruises, gently stroking her hair. [Yan Xi] could no longer hold back his emotions.
1:28:19|1:28:27|She trembled as she touched [Hou Jie]'s face, then threw herself into his arms tightly, [Cao Man] was very satisfied with the scene before him.
1:28:28|1:28:41|Under the command of the officer, the soldiers on the second floor raised their rifles and aimed at the refugees in the cage below. [Jingkong] seized the opportunity to throw the kerosene lamp onto a pile of sacks.
1:28:50|1:29:5|The inner courtyard obviously heard the commotion. The soldiers temporarily stopped the massacre of refugees and rushed to the outer courtyard to put out the fire. [Jingneng] took the lead, leaping to the second floor of the cage. With one swing, he knocked down the guard and took the keys to the prison from the soldier's waist.
1:29:7|1:29:33|The monks had just opened the top gate, and the refugees scrambled out of the cage. Another group of monks descended from above and charged towards the soldiers. [Jingkong] jumped into a defensive position, knocking down two soldiers with rifles with a few sticks. In the outer courtyard, numerous monks and soldiers were entangled in a fight, frightened horses running around the courtyard. The soldiers could no longer resist.
1:29:35|1:29:46|The monk drove a carriage out of the courtyard, [Yan Xi] held [Hou Jie] and cried uncontrollably, while [Cao Man] laughed maniacally on the side, kicking both of them to the ground with one foot. [Hou Jie] roared and rushed up to fight desperately with [Cao Man].
1:29:47|1:30:12|A soldier who just shot and killed a monk in front of him was thrown out by the Shaolin hook wielded by [Jingkong], smashing into the side. [Jingkong] skillfully danced with the stone blocks, knocking down several soldiers in succession. He then wrapped a person with a rope, kicked him out with a flying kick, and the refugees ran frantically on the stairs. They were cut down by the braided soldiers rushing up, and a large number of braided soldiers rushed up the stairs and chopped down anyone they saw, while the refugees weakly fled back.
1:30:12|1:30:18|[Jing Neng] appeared on the second floor in time, waving the Shaolin stick to knock down the two braid soldiers on both sides of the anti-theft net.
1:30:18|1:30:30|[Soltu]'s Mongolian man used a strange light skill, jumping directly onto [Jingneng]'s head. [Jingneng] forcefully threw the man off the stick, who struggled to defend against [Jingneng]'s attacks and was kicked to the ground.
1:30:56|1:31:4|[Cao Man]’s expression became more twisted, he dragged [Yan Xi] to the water tank and lifted her head, causing her to plunge into the tank.
1:31:6|1:31:14|[Cao Man] lifted [Yan Xi] out of the water tank with one hand, then gently held her head under his armpit, caressing her face lightly.
1:31:19|1:31:30|[Cao Man] laughed sinisterly, sticking out his tongue to lick [Yan Xi]'s cheek. Seeing [Hou Jie] struggling in despair, [Cao Man] was very satisfied. [Hou Jie] opened the soldiers' restraints and tried to rush over to save [Yan Xi].
1:31:32|1:31:39|[Cao Man] firmly grabbed [Yan Xi]'s hair, laughing maniacally. A soldier rushed into the hall, the commander.
1:31:44|1:32:12|[Cao Man]'s smile froze instantly, he looked at the soldier reporting to him in disbelief. He shook his head as if trying to digest this unexpected yet somehow expected fact. The soldier hastily let go of [Hou Jie] in his hands, followed [Cao Man] out of the hall. [Hou Jie] was thrown heavily to the ground, struggling to get up, desperately trying to fish [Yan Xi] out of the water tank.
1:32:12|1:32:32|Another group of soldiers rushed into the hall with their guns raised. [Hou Jie] finally grabbed [Yan Xi] by the shoulder and forcefully dragged him. Seven soldiers lined up neatly, preparing their guns. [Hou Jie] exerted all his strength to pull [Yan Xi] out of the water tank. Suddenly, several monks appeared behind the soldiers and effortlessly knocked down the soldiers aiming at [Hou Jie].
1:32:34|1:33:2|[Hou Jie], who narrowly escaped death, hadn't recovered yet. He tightly held his wife in his arms. With the protection of the monk, a large number of refugees escaped from the gates of the [Cao Mansion]. [Jing Neng] somersaulted in the air with a stick, knocking down the braided soldiers on the side. A Mongolian man suddenly appeared and kicked [Jing Neng] from the second floor. Before the opponent could react, [Jing Neng] used his hand as a knife to slash at the man's neck. The Mongolian man raised his elbow to block, but [Jing Neng] continued to strike at various parts with precision.
1:33:2|1:33:16|In the end, [Jingneng] proved to be more skilled, pushing him against the anti-theft net with one palm, kicking him into the net, the spikes of the net scratching the man's neck, then [Jingneng] leaped towards a soldier with a braid, kicking down two people.
1:33:16|1:33:25|[Zoltu] flew out from the side and landed a kick right on [Jingneng]'s head. Caught off guard, [Jingneng] hit the ground hard with his head.
1:33:26|1:33:48|[Soltu] immediately turned around and flew a kick to knock down the monk who was trying to rescue [Jingneng]. [Jingneng] used all his strength to climb up, flew a kick to intercept his attack, then trapped [Soltu]'s fist under his armpit, no matter how [Soltu] attacked, he didn't let go. [Jingneng] suddenly kicked [Soltu] away, rushed to the door, pushed several monks out of the door, and just closed one side of the door.
1:33:50|1:33:54|[Zoltan] was kicked down by [Jingneng] against the door, and [Cao Man] closed the gate.
1:33:56|1:34:14|[Cao Man] walked slowly to the entrance of the courtyard with his soldiers, looking displeased at the man who was evenly matched with [Solon Tu]. The monks desperately knocked on the door, trying to rescue [Jingneng]. [Cao Man] impatiently signaled to the soldiers behind him.
1:34:14|1:34:25|[Jing Neng] had two bloody holes appearing on his chest, desperately trying to straighten himself up, while [Cao Man] on the opposite side lowered his gun impatiently.
1:34:27|1:34:33|Blood gushes from [Jingneng]'s mouth, and [Jingneng] knows very well that no one can currently defeat [Suolongtu].
1:34:37|1:35:0|The monks left the gate in deep sorrow, [Jingneng] faced everything fearlessly despite being seriously injured. Six soldiers rushed towards [Jingneng] with their guns, but he stepped forward and grabbed the gun barrels with his armpits, throwing the soldiers against the wall. With a straight punch, [Jingneng] knocked down a soldier in front of him, then used both fists to smash another one.
1:35:0|1:35:27|By the side, [Cao Man] put down his hand and slowly turned around. He raised his hand and pulled out the two bayonets on the gun barrel, heading straight towards the two soldiers. Without hesitation, [Cao Man] extended the bayonet towards the necks of the two soldiers, then ruthlessly slid the bayonet towards various parts of [Jing Neng]. He retreated to the side of the door, tightly gripping the two sides of the door, acting as the most solid door bolt. [Cao Man] angrily stabbed a bayonet into [Jing Neng]'s chest, then raised the other bayonet and quickly stabbed.
1:35:28|1:35:49|Two military daggers pierced through [Jingneng]'s body, breaking through the door. [Caoman] seemed unwilling to meet [Jingneng's] gaze, spat at [Jingneng], then disdainfully turned and walked away. Watching [Caoman] leave, [Jingneng] finally breathed a sigh of relief. His head weakly leaned against the door frame, slowly closing his eyes. His hands could no longer grip the door frame.
1:35:49|1:36:6|Helplessly hanging down, in order to open a new door of life for the refugees and his junior brothers, [Jingneng] ultimately sacrificed himself and left his life in the residence of [Cao Man]. It has been a day and a night, [Fangzhang] is still hanging on a pole outside the temple, his face pale as if he had lost consciousness.
1:36:6|1:36:31|[Cao Man]'s soldiers remained unmoved. Suddenly, the gates of the Shaolin Temple opened, and a group of young novices holding Shaolin staffs and carrying steamed buns walked out. The soldiers raised their rifles in unison, but the young novices squinted their eyes and continued walking without stopping. [Wudao] followed at the end, holding a bamboo basket. Ignoring the soldiers' warnings, [Wudao] turned around and walked up to [Fangzhang].
1:36:33|1:36:40|[Wudao] helplessly lowered his head and looked at the little novices who were carrying steamed buns and walking forward.
1:36:47|1:37:5|The young novices glanced at each other, still fearless, and continued to move forward. The soldiers fired shots at their feet one by one. The novices' faces were tense, revealing their inner panic. Despite this, they still walked step by step to the soldiers' front, who also looked at each other in confusion.
1:37:12|1:37:18|Several soldiers, upon hearing these words, slowly lowered their guns. The leading officer glanced around the area.
1:37:28|1:37:54|The novice monk raised the steaming steamed bun in his hand and brought it in front of the soldiers. The officer watched as the bun slowly lowered the barrel of the gun in front of him. He picked up a bun, and the two soldiers beside him also put away their guns. Suddenly, the officer was shot through the chest. Faced with another group of fierce soldiers, the novices quickly retreated. [Wudao] hurriedly threw the bamboo basket in his hand aside.
1:37:54|1:38:31|A young novice monk fell from the sky and beat the soldier on the head. The soldier finally managed to throw the young novice monk aside, but was knocked unconscious by a flying iron pot. [Wudao] looked anxiously at the braid soldiers while holding a shovel. Dozens of braid soldiers, holding machetes, aggressively formed a formation and charged towards [Wudao]. He dodged the slashing blades by propping up the shovel and used it to block the machetes in an S-shaped curve, preventing the braid soldiers from picking up their knives after several attempts.
1:38:32|1:38:35|[Wudao] swung the machete, carefully positioning his hands.
1:38:39|1:39:7|Two soldiers with braids flew over, crossing over [Wudao] from both sides, and slashed into his shoulder blades with a backhand. When he stood up again, there were two bloody wounds on his back. [Wudao] gripped the shovel and glared ahead, then charged in with the shovel, knocking down the pillar with [Fangzhang] hanging on it, causing the huge wooden frame to collapse and [Fangzhang] to fall from the shelf.
1:39:7|1:39:22|The young novice angrily besieged the soldier who was shooting, standing on the table, using sharp martial arts to knock the soldier out. [Wudao] then struggled to help [Fangzhang] sit down on the side.
1:39:22|1:39:42|[Master Wudao] grabbed one person's arm, then grabbed his collar and threw him into the nearby iron pot. Stepping on the struggling braided soldier inside the pot, [Master Wudao] picked up the iron pot and swung it outwards. Taking advantage of this, he swung the iron pot to knock away two people, then caught the person who was thrown out and put him back into the pot.
1:39:42|1:40:10|[Wudao] quickly pulled the table next to him, then he grabbed the braided soldier who jumped onto the table, using his dough-kneading technique to twist him around and throw him away. As two people rushed towards him, [Wudao] skillfully used the braided soldier's arm on the table to hit many of his companions, then pushed him off the table with great force, sending the two people in front flying out. [Wudao] then lifted the table and smashed through the heads of the last two people.
1:40:17|1:40:40|The crowd helped [Abbot] up, with monks guarding the bell and drum towers of the Shaolin Temple. The melodious sound of the bell rang out, heralding the beginning of a new day. Meanwhile, a heavy sound emanated from the drum tower, with the bell and drum resonating together. Led by [Jingkong], the Shaolin disciples who went to rescue the refugees from the Cao Mansion finally returned, each of them bearing numerous injuries.
1:40:40|1:40:59|The rescued men rushed forward to search for their loved ones, the women in the temple couldn't help but stand up to greet their returning family members, and the young children flew into the arms of their fathers. This kind of emotion seemed to be contagious, spreading throughout the entire temple in an instant.
1:40:59|1:41:12|The elderly man anxiously turned his head to find his child, the husband finally embraced his wife, the daughter also hugged her father tightly, everyone held each other tightly, and people were overwhelmed with joy and tears.
1:41:12|1:41:16|The long-awaited reunion this time has brought everyone's hearts closely together.
1:41:16|1:41:24|On the other side, the monks all sat in the scripture hall, facing the Buddha statue, with their hands clasped together, silently reciting the Buddha's name.
1:41:32|1:41:49|[ Hou Jie ] still shed tears for his departure, closing his eyes, for his daughter, for his wife, for his deceased senior brother, silently reciting the Buddhist mantra. After the moment of silence, a group of monks walked out from the Buddha hall, all of them with their palms together, standing on the steps in front of the hall.
1:41:56|1:42:12|The refugees had just calmed down from the joy of surviving the disaster, but were then shocked by this news. [Fangzhang] and [Hou Jie] walked to the front, clasping their hands together in compassion as they looked at everyone in the courtyard. When the refugees saw [Fangzhang], they stopped talking and quietly raised their heads.
1:42:26|1:42:32|[Yan Xi] leaned against the door frame, looking sadly at [Hou Jie], only to see [Hou Jie] put down his hand and walk towards the refugees.
1:43:2|1:43:9|[Hou Jie] looked around firmly.
1:43:16|1:43:34|Tears streamed down the face of [Hou Jie] as he clasped his hands together. The refugees knew that the monks were even more reluctant to leave the Shaolin Temple than they were. They all knelt down in the courtyard, choked with emotion, making the solemn promise to the Shaolin disciples in front of them.
1:43:34|1:43:40|The monks all put their hands together in prayer, bowing their heads in silence as if bidding their final farewell.
1:43:40|1:43:48|[Yan Xi] leaned against the door frame, quietly watching the man who had changed completely. [Yan Xi] leaned against the door frame, tears streaming down her face, feeling powerless.
1:43:52|1:44:7|The monks assisted the refugees in an orderly manner to pack up and plan their route. Wudao was not in a hurry to pack his belongings, he sat on the steps beside the main hall, quietly observing everything in front of him. [Hou Jie] quietly walked over to sit beside Wudao.
1:44:28|1:44:39|[Hou Jie] gestured for Wudao to look at the refugees. Wudao glanced at the refugees and then turned cautiously to [Hou Jie].
1:44:39|1:44:48|Wudao turned his eyes. It seemed like he was considering the credibility of this statement.
1:44:48|1:44:56|Led by the monks, the refugees orderly set foot on the road leading away from the Shaolin Temple, embarking together on a journey into the unknown world.
1:44:56|1:45:24|Outside the Shaolin Temple at this moment, soldiers placed two bundles of explosives at the gate. After securing the explosives, they carefully moved the fuse to the other side of the steps. [Cao Man] was surrounded by a group of soldiers, dressed in a dark blue dragon robe, leaning sideways on the horse. Several gates of the Shaolin Temple were simultaneously blown open, even the warhorses were startled. The refugees immediately hastened their pace up the mountain. [Jingkong] swiftly stood in front of the abbot, holding a Shaolin staff.
1:46:58|1:47:22|He quickly stepped forward to help up an injured monk, leading him up the stairs of the scripture pavilion. [Cao Man] and [Solontu] rode their horses into the Shaolin Temple, [Solontu] easily killed the monks blocking their way, [Jingkong] aggressively attacked [Solontu] with every move aiming for vital points, [Cao Man] dismounted in front of the hall, holding a golden-handled long knife as he walked into the main hall. In the blink of an eye, [Solontu] turned defense into offense, only to be kicked by [Jingkong].
1:47:27|1:47:40|[Zoltu] raised his long sword and swung it horizontally. [Jingkong] swiftly raised his hand to block the sword, then simultaneously defended and attacked, forcing [Zoltu] to hide behind a wooden fence. Seizing the opportunity, [Zoltu] struck horizontally when [Jingkong] was off guard.
1:47:40|1:47:45|The blade cuts through the wooden fence, closing in on [Jingkong], who dodges the blade.
1:47:45|1:47:51|Two people kicked through the wooden fence and saw [Zoro], taking the opportunity as [Jingkong] turned around, a sword slashed into [Jingkong]'s back.
1:47:51|1:48:0|Abbot and [Jinghai] were still directing the refugees to run towards the backyard, but the soldiers quickly caught up and shot several monks who were escorting the refugees.
1:48:0|1:48:26|In the grand hall, a group of monks walked quickly through the scripture library on the second floor. [Hou Jie] stopped in his tracks, standing at the railing on the second floor looking down. He switched the Shaolin staff to his other hand, staring coldly at the person below. [Cao Man] stood in the hall, his eyes fixed on [Hou Jie]. Slowly, he moved up the stairs, [Hou Jie] no longer looking down, he turned around and waved the Shaolin staff, assuming a stance, while [Cao Man] leisurely strolled up the steps.
1:48:26|1:48:35|Step by step up the stairs, he walked towards [Hou Jie] with a hint of mockery in his smile, dragging a long knife. [Hou Jie] looked quietly at [Cao Man].
1:48:46|1:48:54|[Cao Man] walked to a distance of one meter from [Hou Jie],
1:49:3|1:49:25|[Cao Man] looked expressionlessly at the chatty [Hou Jie]. [Cao Man] swung his knife towards [Hou Jie], but it was blocked by [Hou Jie] with a stick. He then pulled the knife out of its sheath and stabbed directly at [Hou Jie]'s throat. [Hou Jie] became somewhat angry and knocked the tip of the knife with a stick.
1:49:36|1:49:58|And quickly swung the Shaolin staff towards him, [Cao Man] couldn't defend himself and was hit on the calf, directly kneeling on the ground. [Cao Man] also took the opportunity to swing the long knife towards [Hou Jie]'s leg. As [Hou Jie] dodged, his staff technique was strong and powerful, deflecting [Cao Man]'s blade. He then smashed down towards [Cao Man]'s head. [Cao Man] quickly danced his huge sleeves behind him, momentarily blocking [Hou Jie]'s line of sight.
1:49:58|1:50:8|[Cao Man] took advantage of the situation and kicked [Hou Jie], sending him flying several meters away. Ignoring his shoulder injury, [Hou Jie] seized the opportunity to drape [Cao Man]'s large dragon robe over his head.
1:50:8|1:50:30|Shortly after, [Hou Jie] flicked the dragon robe off [Cao Man]'s body, then struck [Cao Man] in the chest with a stick. [Cao Man] glared fiercely at [Hou Jie], but as soon as he gripped the knife handle, the blade was stepped on by [Hou Jie]. [Cao Man] lay motionless on the ground, staring at the ceiling. Seeing [Cao Man] no longer resisting, [Hou Jie] slowly retracted the Shaolin staff.
1:50:30|1:50:51|At the moment when [Hou Jie] took away the Shaolin staff, [Cao Man] used the momentum to turn around and kick [Hou Jie] in the chest. [Hou Jie] fell by the armrest, but managed to grab the Shaolin staff in time. [Cao Man] then stabbed [Hou Jie] in the abdomen with a knife, pulled out the knife and struck [Hou Jie] again. Several kilometers away, in an open space, ten large cannons were neatly arranged in two rows, aiming directly at the Shaolin Temple.
1:51:9|1:51:33|Countless shells flew towards the Shaolin Temple, colliding with the buildings and creating huge sparks. The bell tower was instantly blown into pieces by several shells, and the monks and soldiers fighting under the bell tower were also killed or injured. Several shells landed in the courtyard, causing massive explosions, and countless bricks and tiles fell from the roofs. The people outside the meditation hall could not escape the flames.
1:51:33|1:51:47|Jingkong and [Solontu] were still fighting in the courtyard. Jingkong rolled on the ground, dodging the blades swung by [Solontu]. Then he raised his hand to block, and the last blade was also chopped off by [Solontu]. Without a weapon, Jingkong instantly fell into a disadvantage.
1:51:47|1:51:54|[Zoro] slashed at Jingkong's chest, leaving a trail of blood as Jingkong was knocked down at Shaolin Temple.
1:51:54|1:52:22|[Solontu] held his long knife unscathed, provocatively staring at Jingkong. The shells kept falling inside the Shaolin Temple. Jingkong glared at [Solontu], roaring as he charged forward. [Solontu] thrust out a final blow, piercing Jingkong's abdomen. Jingkong looked at the sword in his belly, then at the sneering [Solontu]. He grabbed the sword and thrust it forward several times, stabbing the half blade in his hand into Solontu's chest. The honor of the Shaolin Temple cannot be violated.
1:52:24|1:52:37|Jingkong exerted his last bit of strength, gripping the sword hilt in his abdomen, and turned to slide the blade on his back towards [Solontu]. He lifted his foot and kicked [Solontu] down the steps, causing [Solontu] to roll several times on the steps before coming to a stop.
1:52:41|1:53:6|Jingkong knelt on the ground, facing the main hall, palms together in a final bow. The place where he was instantly turned into flat ground by a shell. Looking at the smoke filling the Shaolin Temple, the foreign military officer burst into a maniacal laugh. The Zen room outside had been blown to pieces. Under the huge impact, several monks were blown away. At this moment, a woman suddenly rushed back.
1:53:11|1:53:40|[Jinghai] looked at the child hiding in the corner of the stairs, only to see him raise the Shaolin staff high, kick a soldier on the stairs to stabilize his steps, then sweep with the staff, pushing the remaining soldiers on the stairs down. He turned and walked to the corner of the stairs, holding the crying child in his arms. Several monks hurried down to assist, escorting [Jinghai] to the backyard. Soldiers under the steps raised their guns and started shooting upwards. [Jinghai] had just handed the child to the mother next to him.
1:53:40|1:53:46|Several huge holes appeared behind.
1:53:47|1:54:0|[Jinghai] weakly knelt down on the ground, blood continuously flowing from his mouth. He mustered up the last of his strength to lift the corners of his mouth and look towards [Abbot]. [Abbot] suddenly nodded, watching as [Jinghai]'s palms, folded in prayer, weakly fell down.
1:54:4|1:54:11|Please evacuate the villagers to a safe place while the artillery bombardment continues fiercely.
1:54:11|1:54:35|Within the Shaolin Temple, all that remained were ruins and broken walls, which were suddenly engulfed in flames from the cannons. The foreign soldiers paid no heed to the soldiers of Cao Man and completely destroyed both them and the Shaolin Temple. Bullets kept exploding around them, with [Abbot] standing alone in front of the backyard gate, swinging his hands to throw two soldiers behind him. He then stomped on a soldier's foot, aimed at the soldier's long spear, and lifted him up. [Abbot] pushed away the soldier next to him.
1:54:35|1:54:50|Several long spears extended by the opponent were clamped under the armpit, and a fist struck their chests. The soldiers under the steps knew they were no match for [Fangzhang], and they all raised their guns to shoot. [Fangzhang] spat out a mouthful of blood, covered his chest, and struggled to stay standing.
1:54:50|1:55:8|He knelt down facing the courtyard, with [Abbot] folding his hands together and silently reciting the final Buddhist chant. As he passed away in the courtyard, behind him the doorway was piled with the bodies of countless soldiers, the artillery fire still raging on without stopping. The inner courtyard was also affected, with numerous monks and soldiers caught in the crossfire.
1:55:9|1:55:35|[Hou Jie] and [Cao Man] are still fighting in the scripture pavilion. [Hou Jie] grabs the hand of [Cao Man] holding the knife, but he breaks free. A shell falls onto the roof, piercing through it, creating a huge air wave that flips [Hou Jie] and [Cao Man] together. They both fall to the ground, struggling to get up. [Hou Jie] lies on the ground, lifting his head to look at the injured [Cao Man] beside him.
1:55:37|1:55:43|[Cao Man] remained unmoved, struggling to turn towards [Hou Jie], still intent on killing his elder brother.
1:55:43|1:55:54|A cannonball unexpectedly landed behind them. He only managed to raise his hand to protect his head before being thrown out by the huge blast, tumbling all the way to the side of the scripture hall and falling down headfirst.
1:55:54|1:56:8|[Hou Jie] flew out and grabbed [Cao Man]'s half leg, with half of his body hanging in the air, only supported by his toes hooked on the floor, barely holding up the weight of two people, and the scripture pavilion was instantly blown to pieces.
1:56:9|1:56:31|[Cao Man] heard the sound and reached out, grabbing [Hou Jie]'s arm. The explosion struck again, blasting through the floor of the scripture pavilion. Flames surged up from [Cao Man]'s body, veins bulging on [Hou Jie]'s forehead, but he still refused to let go. [Cao Man] used [Hou Jie]'s arm to climb up, finally grabbing the edge of the floor and climbing up to the scripture pavilion. [Hou Jie] gasped for breath, trying to get up first.
1:56:31|1:56:45|Seeing [Hou Jie] making a move, [Cao Man] quickly grabbed a wooden stick nearby and struggled to stand up. [Hou Jie] was half kneeling on the ground, blood continuously pouring out from his mouth, with only a look of persuasion in his eyes.
1:56:47|1:56:52|[Cao Man] held a wooden stick, stood still on the side, looking at [Hou Jie] with an expression of disbelief.
1:56:58|1:57:17|[Hou Jie] struggled to say every word, and after speaking, he seemed unable to support his own body any longer. He lowered his head and slowly knelt down. Outside, the artillery fire continued, and two shells accurately landed on the walls of the main hall. The roof of the hall was immediately smashed, and heavy beams fell down.
1:57:17|1:57:40|[Cao Man] suddenly looked up at the roof without moving his feet, [Hou Jie] fearfully raised his head and saw the beam about to fall on [Cao Man]'s head. He suddenly got up and flew towards [Cao Man], pushing him hard out of the way before the beam fell. The beam, carrying debris, fell down and hit [Hou Jie]'s head, then heavily smashed onto his body, pinning him underneath.
1:57:40|1:57:52|[Cao Man] was stunned. He stood up instinctively and walked towards [Hou Jie] step by step. [Hou Jie] seemed to want to say something, but blood kept gushing out of his mouth.
1:57:52|1:58:13|[Cao Man] stared at [Hou Jie] without blinking, showing a confused expression for the first time. The wooden stick that was tightly held in his hand fell to the ground. By now, [Cao Man]'s heart was filled with incomprehension as he looked at [Hou Jie] with lifeless eyes, only the constant rise and fall of his chest telling [Cao Man] that he was still alive.
1:58:13|1:58:21|[Cao Man] stood at one end of the beam, bending down to try to lift it up, but no matter how hard he tried, the beam remained unmoved.
1:58:21|1:58:49|[Cao Man] gasped with a hint of sobbing as he struggled to move the crossbeam. The crossbeam only moved slightly, not enough to rescue [Hou Jie]. Instead, because of the slight movement of the crossbeam in front of his chest, [Hou Jie] was hit by another painful explosion, but it did not shake [Cao Man]'s determination to save him. [Hou Jie] was still pinned under the crossbeam, and was pushed out of the scripture pavilion by the shockwave. He retreated, sliding down from the side, accompanied by falling debris and dust.
1:58:49|1:59:17|The body unexpectedly flew towards the Buddha statue in the hall. [Cao Man] lifted his head and watched quietly as [Hou Jie]'s body flew out and collided with the chest of the Buddha statue. He watched helplessly as [Hou Jie] slid down the chest of the Buddha statue, his fingers even touching the symbol on the Buddha's chest. [Hou Jie] fell into the intertwined hands of the Buddha statue, his eyes open but his hands hanging weakly. The Shaolin disciples rushed out of the haystack and finally found the mastermind behind the attack on the Shaolin Temple.
1:59:17|1:59:38|They wielded long spears without hesitation to stimulate the chests of those foreign soldiers, a monk's spear was just inserted into the chest of the lieutenant and shot dead on the side, behind him another monk held a shield in one hand and a knife in the other, more like that foreign military officer a knife chopped down, in the hall [Cao Man] still lay there, looking at [Hou Jie]'s body firmly.
1:59:38|2:0:2|[Hou Jie] lies in the palm of the Buddha statue, with an unprecedented calm expression. The confusion in [Cao Man]'s eyes disappears, because [Hou Jie] has awakened him with his life. [Cao Man] looks deeply at [Hou Jie], slowly lowers his head, his posture getting lower and lower, his body sinking little by little, finally prostrating in front of the Buddha statue for a long time without moving, reflecting on everything he has done in his heart.
2:0:2|2:0:30|The sound of gunfire continued unabated, although the Shaolin Temple had been burned to the ground, the plaque of the main hall, the Mahavira Hall, still hung high above. [Cao Man] walked out with a dirty face, staring blankly at the devastation in front of him. The Shaolin Temple was in ruins, with walls and debris everywhere. The area in front of the main hall had been leveled by artillery fire. [Cao Man] took a few steps forward, only to realize that he had nowhere to go.
2:0:30|2:0:57|The profound statue of Shakyamuni Buddha stands solemnly on the main hall, looking down compassionately at the suffering beings in the world. The temple is in ruins, with bodies scattered on the ground, all telling the cruel reality of war to [Cao Man]. [Cao Man] looks sorrowfully at the soldiers' bodies everywhere, his furrowed brows trembling uncontrollably. He takes a few steps forward, choking back tears as he looks around. Currently, he is the only one alive standing on the main hall of Shaolin Temple. [Cao Man] sneers.
2:0:57|2:1:21|With a sobbing cry, a huge sense of grief and inner shame prevented him from crying out loud. Helplessly reaching out his hand, he only grasped emptiness. There was nothing to support him standing in front of them. [Cao Man] knelt on the ground, looking up at the sky. A large hole appeared in the roof above the Buddha statue, with sunlight shining on the statue, making it appear even more solemn and dignified.
2:1:21|2:1:29|It's raining, the rain is falling diagonally through the roof onto the face of the Buddha statue, dripping down along his eyes.
2:1:29|2:1:36|It seems like even Siddhartha Gautama is weeping for the tragic fate of the Shaolin Temple. [Hou Jie] lies peacefully in the arms of a Buddha statue.
2:1:36|2:1:52|A beam of sunlight fell on him, rain splashed on [Hou Jie]'s face, washing away his bloodstains and sins from the past. The rain grew heavier, mixing with blood as it flowed down the stairs, silently recounting the catastrophe of the Shaolin Temple.
2:1:52|2:2:9|Refugees, led by [Wudao], safely moved to the jungle behind the Shaolin Temple. Everyone walked silently along the mountain path with their bags on their backs. [Wudao] held a Shaolin staff in his hand and carried two huge boxes in his arms, leading a few young monks at the front.
2:2:9|2:2:19|He inadvertently turned his head to look into the distance, as if being mesmerized. Everyone stopped in their tracks and followed his gaze, overlooking a stretch of green mountains and waters.
2:2:19|2:2:36|In the distance, the Shaolin Temple is shrouded in thick smoke. Wudao seems to have anticipated this, he just sighed deeply and looked into the distance. Beside him, the young novice monk is already in tears, and the refugees watching the Shaolin Temple engulfed in smoke are all crying out in pain.
2:2:40|2:2:54|The young novice wiped away his tears, enduring the pain in his heart as he gazed at the Shaolin Temple with determination and pride in his eyes.
2:2:54|2:3:7|The refugees on the suspension bridge also stopped and looked towards the Shaolin Temple. [Yan Xi] stood at the edge of the bridge, holding tightly to her daughter's urn. Tears streamed down her face as she buried her head deep into her embrace.
2:3:7|2:3:18|He thought once again of his husband's peaceful smile before this escape, at that time he stood calmly in front of himself, having already let go of everything in his eyes.
2:3:20|2:3:28|Living freely comes from going with the flow. [Hou Jie] handed a jar to [Yan Xi] with a smile.
2:3:28|2:3:37|In the future, let him accompany you. Looking at the urn handed over by [Hou Jie], [Yan Xi] finally reached out and took the urn.
2:3:37|2:4:13|Holding tightly in her arms, she gently caressed the urn, as if stroking her daughter's head. [Yan Xi] tried to calm himself down, he looked up at [Hou Jie], who smiled and shook his head. "I'm not leaving," [Hou Jie] said. Looking at [Yan Xi] seriously, [Cao Man] arrived. [Yan Xi] nodded knowingly, as if he had already anticipated his choice. Looking at [Hou Jie], [Yan Xi] was filled with contentment in his eyes.
