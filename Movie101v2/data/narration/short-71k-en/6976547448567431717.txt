0:3:19|0:3:25|Zhang, with a big mouth and eyes full of love for the broken guitar band and rock music, saw the excited [Hu Liang] in the crowd.
0:3:25|0:3:29|Cheng Gong threw the broken guitar band's nameplate into Hu Liang's hands with relief.
0:3:30|0:3:38|With the band's popularity soaring, the Jilin Province Jilin City Rock Star City Sculpture Project organized by the local government officially kicked off with the participation of the broken guitar band and numerous media outlets.
0:4:6|0:4:22|With the project starting, a large amount of materials were transported to the square, with a large number of manpower and resources invested. What was originally a barren square was quickly covered with floor tiles, and the surrounding vegetation also flourished. As time passed day by day, a guitar sculpture tens of meters high rose from the ground.
0:4:22|0:4:27|Soon after, the title of the film "The Sewing Machine Band" appeared on the screen in a very hardcore manner.
0:4:27|0:4:32|In 2017, agent Cheng Gong took the delivery and headed towards the training room.
0:4:32|0:4:40|At this moment, the band of three, who were unaware of the imminent arrival of [Cheng Gong], were singing rock in the rehearsal room.
0:5:26|0:5:32|Upon seeing [Cheng Gong] push the door open, the three of them stopped singing abruptly.
0:5:35|0:5:42|After listening, the three of them looked at each other holding guitars, at a loss. Then, [Cheng Gong] sat on the sofa and played a video for the three of them.
0:5:44|0:5:48|The lead singer and guitarist listened to the accompaniment, dancing listlessly with a sullen face.
0:5:48|0:5:52|The drummer stood with his head down, looking defiant, unwilling to even lift his hands.
0:5:52|0:5:58|[Cheng Gong] paused the music and impatiently threw his phone on the table as he looked at the three people in front of him who were being extremely perfunctory.
0:6:0|0:6:7|He leaned back on the sofa, looking disappointedly at the three people, when the drummer spoke.
0:6:35|0:6:40|He picked up the lollipop next to him and tore it open forcefully.
0:6:40|0:6:48|The lollipop fell to the ground as if challenging [Cheng Gong], who picked it up without hesitation, dusted it off, and put it in his mouth.
0:7:2|0:7:10|Later, [Cheng Gong] pushed open the door of the hospital ward with three people holding flowers and fruit baskets, smiling, only to find it empty.
0:7:10|0:7:17|Shortly after, [Cheng Gong] opened the letter left by Manager Fan on the table.
0:8:31|0:8:34|As the warehouse door opened, colorful long johns spilled out.
0:8:34|0:8:41|The manager casually took out a pair of long johns, with the word "open eyes" written on the buttocks and a glasses pattern on the crotch.
0:8:41|0:8:44|After mocking each other, they carried boxes of long johns back home.
0:8:44|0:8:50|At night, [Cheng Gong], who was already penniless, searched through the room filled with piled up long johns, looking for high-interest loans without any hope.
0:8:50|0:8:57|At this moment, Cheng Gong's email popped up with a message begging for cooperation, and when opened, Hu Liang sang while holding a guitar.
0:9:29|0:9:32|[Cheng Gong] angrily slammed the computer shut and cursed.
0:9:32|0:9:39|Later, Cheng Gong, who didn't take it seriously, cooked instant noodles in the kitchen, wearing the very funny long johns left by Manager Ding on his legs.
0:9:39|0:9:43|At this moment, the phone suddenly vibrated, and [Cheng Gong] hesitated for a moment before answering the call.
0:10:50|0:10:59|The day after receiving the deposit, [Cheng Gong] boarded the train to Jilin, and the weather was as bright as his mood.
0:10:59|0:11:11|After a long journey of several hours, they finally arrived in Jianshi City. Getting off the car, [Cheng Gong] walked through the crowd with a bewildered look, dragging his suitcase. At a glance, he saw the conspicuous pick-up sign with sunflowers stuck on it.
0:11:18|0:11:23|Suddenly, a children's band started playing loudly and enthusiastically.
0:11:26|0:11:31|At the command of [Hu Liang], two elementary school students, one holding a garland and the other holding a bouquet, walked up to [Cheng Gong].
0:11:31|0:11:39|Surrounded by a crowd of onlookers who pulled out their phones to record, [Cheng Gong] awkwardly went along with everyone. Then, [Hu Liang] suddenly embraced [Cheng Gong].
0:12:35|0:12:41|[Cheng Gong] looked at the messy room and hesitated to enter.
0:13:39|0:13:45|Through the large guitar sculpture poster, the camera pans to the rock park with a giant guitar standing tall.
0:13:53|0:13:59|Cheng Gong glanced at Hu Liang's necklace.
0:14:50|0:14:57|Cheng Gong looked disdainful and ignored him, then said.
0:15:22|0:15:30|Hu Liang, who hasn't adjusted the angle yet, is attracted by the singing. At this moment, two knights fully armed on motorcycles pass by in the distance.
0:15:30|0:15:37|[Hu Liang] stared intently ahead. At this moment, [Cheng Gong], who was still swinging his arms in place, asked.
0:15:39|0:15:48|[Cheng Gong] turned around and found that [Hu Liang] was actually taking photos of the motorcyclists. Later, the two riders also kindly took a group photo with [Cheng Gong] and [Hu Liang].
0:15:50|0:15:55|At night, after [Hu Liang] finished admiring the group photo while lying on the bed, he turned around with a mischievous smile and looked ambiguously at [Cheng Gong].
0:16:55|0:16:59|In a hurry to chase someone, [Hu Liang] slipped and rolled from the doorway to the bend in the middle of the stairs.
0:16:59|0:17:7|[Cheng Gong] dropped his bag upon seeing the situation, and hurried to [Hu Liang]. As he saw him faint on the ground, just as he was about to approach, [Hu Liang] smirked and opened his eyes.
0:17:12|0:17:18|Hu Liang tried to grab Cheng Gong's leg, but ended up facing down and sliding from the middle of the stairs to the ground.
0:17:20|0:17:27|After speaking, he walked past him mercilessly. Just as he was going down the stairs, his ankle was grabbed, and [Cheng Gong] impatiently struggled and asked.
0:17:49|0:17:55|Upon hearing that they needed to pay more, [Cheng Gong] set down the backpack containing the mobile phone.
0:18:30|0:18:42|The audition has officially begun. [Hu Liang] was afraid of too many people, so he set up hundreds of chairs on the flat ground, but only three people came. A delicate-looking girl leaning on crutches, a snobbish young man, and an ordinary middle-aged man.
0:19:7|0:19:15|[Ding Jianguo] gave the two a disdainful look, then the man beside him introduced.
0:20:31|0:20:37|With that, he lifted his leg onto the armrest to block the way.
0:20:57|0:21:4|At this moment, music teacher [Qiao Dashan] and his daughter [Xi Xi] were hiding in a warehouse at the school, playing the piano.
0:21:4|0:21:10|The two were completely immersed in the music, the sunlight shining through the blurred glass, warming their faces.
0:21:10|0:21:14|Suddenly, a knock on the door interrupted them.
0:21:59|0:22:3|As soon as the words fell, a footprint was left on the iron door of the residence.
0:22:4|0:22:14|Seeing another footprint, [Qiao Dashan] hurriedly ran to the corner. Then, the iron gate was kicked open, and a short-haired woman in a Taoist robe stood at the doorway.
0:22:14|0:22:17|Qiao Dashan immediately knelt down upon seeing his wife.
0:22:22|0:22:30|Seeing [Xi Xi]'s mother with a strong presence at the door, [Cheng Gong] timidly took a few steps back. At this moment, [Hu Liang] spoke. Shortly after, he and [Qiao Dashan] knelt down together.
0:23:15|0:23:20|[Xi Xi]'s mother suddenly turned her head to look at the two men, [Qiao Dashan] and [Hu Liang] immediately raised the dumbbells in their hands and knelt straight.
0:23:20|0:23:24|Then, he turned his head and said to [Xi Xi].
0:23:25|0:23:44|After patting [Xi Xi] on the back, [Cheng Gong] immediately stood up, exerted a little force on his heel, and the chair suddenly smashed towards [Hu Liang]. While everyone was still in a daze, another kick swept over [Xi Xi]'s head, and she used her heel to smash the electronic piano on the shelf.
0:23:46|0:23:51|With a loud shout from [Xi Xi]'s mother, the electronic piano was split in half and fell to the ground.
0:23:51|0:23:56|The three big men were shivering at this moment, [Xi Xi]'s mother turned her head and looked at [Cheng Gong] standing with sharp eyes.
0:23:58|0:24:5|After a one-second eye contact with [Cheng Gong], he immediately knelt on the keyboard. Later, the two of them arrived at a gynecological hospital.
0:24:33|0:24:38|After hearing the nurse call out the name, a middle-aged woman raised her hand and walked in. After work, [Yang Shuangshu] played with his grandson while wearing a mask.
0:24:47|0:24:51|[Yang Shuangshu] took off his mask upon hearing this, and said solemnly.
0:25:8|0:25:15|[Yang Shuangshu] took a sip of water, then slowly put down the cup and said with great emphasis.
0:25:43|0:25:49|Yang Shuangshu, who had just taken a sip of water, sprayed it out, and at this moment, Cheng Gong spoke again.
0:26:15|0:26:21|After hearing such a realistic answer, [Hu Liang] looked at [Yang Shuangshu] in disbelief. Then, he stood up excitedly.
0:26:38|0:26:48|Shortly after, [Yang Shuangshu] pulled open a drawer and pressed a button. The moment the button was pressed, the doors and windows in the room closed instantly.
0:26:49|0:26:56|Before [Cheng Gong] could finish speaking, the hidden speakers in the medicine cabinet suddenly appeared, and the light above shone vertically on [Yang Shuangshu], his eyes full of disdain.
0:26:56|0:27:3|At this moment, the sign that originally said "Women's Friend" has also changed to "Guitar Emperor," and the ward behind [Yang Shuangshu] has also undergone changes.
0:27:3|0:27:18|The hospital bed and cabinet were replaced by musical instruments, and [Yang Shuangshu] began to play the instruments.
0:27:34|0:27:41|At this moment, a voice came from the phone in [Hu Liang]'s hand.
0:30:11|0:30:17|At this moment, [Yang Shuangshu] opens another box. [Hu Liang] stops and looks towards the guitar, then asks in surprise.
0:30:19|0:30:25|[Yang Shuangshu] took out a handkerchief to wipe the guitar, ignoring [Hu Liang].
0:30:57|0:31:3|At this moment, Hu Liang looked at Zha Yao sitting with his back against the wall and said.
0:32:1|0:32:4|After listening, Zha Yao rolled up his sleeves and got serious.
0:32:15|0:32:21|At this moment, Ding Jianguo, who heard the drumming, spontaneously joined in.
0:32:31|0:32:38|[Xi Xi] followed suit and started playing along with the rhythm. Little did anyone expect that as a primary school student, [Xi Xi] could play so well.
0:32:46|0:33:14|As the guitar emperor Yang Shuangshu naturally joined in. Just now, the lead singer Hu Liang, who had just scorned everyone, stood there with his mouth wide open in surprise.
0:33:14|0:33:20|Regaining his composure, [Cheng Gong] exchanged a smile with the equally surprised [Sun Dali], when suddenly, [Sun Dali] shouted as he walked in.
0:34:9|0:34:17|The impatient crowd interrupted Sun Dali with music.
0:34:17|0:34:23|At this moment, [Zhang Facai] in the car is peeping at [Ding Jianguo] through a telescope.
0:36:6|0:36:12|After listening, [Zhang Facai] said in confusion.
0:36:22|0:36:30|Upon hearing this, he quickly picked up the binoculars and looked into the house. At that moment, [Hu Liang] and [Ding Jianguo] were flirting with each other inside the house.
0:36:32|0:36:39|Ignoring the money in his hands, Manager Ding looked at the two of them with dissatisfaction, especially at the plump Hu Liang, and speculated.
0:36:57|0:37:5|Qiao Dashan on the side said. Then, Xi Xi's mother walked away with a satisfied look on her face.
0:37:5|0:37:14|Qiao Dashan gently closed the door as he looked at the figure sleeping. At that moment, a figure behind the curtain began to appear faintly. As the curtain was slowly lifted, Xi Xi emerged.
0:37:14|0:37:23|The real [Xi Xi] looked towards the door, cautiously confirming, and after seeing the closed door, she walked to the bed and pulled up her stunt double, then walked out.
0:37:24|0:37:32|Yang Shuangshu, who had just taken the stunt double on the fire truck ladder, said, "It turns out that the person on the bed is not Xi Xi, but my grandson."
0:39:11|0:39:18|No one else made a move, only [Cheng Gong] clapped in response. Seeing the awkward situation, [Cheng Gong] raised his hand to signal him to start singing.
0:39:59|0:40:4|Seeing that no one was speaking, [Cheng Gong] asked [Ding Jianguo].
0:40:6|0:40:13|Listening to this, [Cheng Gong] lowered his head in frustration and looked at [Hu Liang] with a helpless expression.
0:40:23|0:40:29|Calm down, [Cheng Gong] returned and wrote a song on the blackboard, saying to everyone.
0:40:36|0:40:38|[Hu Liang] squinted his eyes, playing the instrument while watching.
0:40:48|0:40:56|Soon after, everyone was ready.
0:43:36|0:43:48|After successfully rehearsing at the base, this song began to be performed at various locations in the city.
0:44:56|0:45:2|After three rounds of drinks, everyone was happily chatting and laughing on the rooftop.
0:45:2|0:45:7|But [Cheng Gong] was drinking alone on the side, and when [Ding Jianguo] saw this, he hobbled over with a bottle of liquor and asked.
0:45:29|0:45:34|[Cheng Gong] took a deep breath and said.
0:46:48|0:46:54|Finishing speaking, [Ding Jianguo] made a self-deprecating scissor gesture, [Ding Jianguo] lowered his head after hearing it, and then asked again after a moment.
0:47:26|0:47:36|Cheng Gong looked at the brightly lit city and took a big sip of his drink. Then, a hand slowly rested on his shoulder. Thinking it was Ding Jianguo embracing him, he caressed the hand on his shoulder.
0:47:36|0:47:47|After exchanging a smile, [Ding Jianguo] reached out and tousled his own hair, causing [Cheng Gong] to realize something was wrong. [Hu Liang] made a shushing gesture and tearfully said.
0:48:4|0:48:13|[Hu Liang] raised his glass high and proudly applauded after speaking, but the others walked away disdainfully. Afterwards, they officially confirmed the name of the band as the Sewing Machine Band.
0:48:25|0:48:29|With several people shouting in unison, the team's cohesion became even stronger.
0:48:29|0:48:34|The next morning, real estate manager [Manager Ding] rode a tricycle to the home of the nail household, Old Deng.
0:49:19|0:49:24|Ding Jianguo, the stubborn homeowner, stood at the gate of the courtyard, holding a shovel and facing the demolition team with a determined attitude.
0:49:24|0:49:27|Many workers and excavators helplessly stopped outside the courtyard.
0:49:27|0:49:34|At this moment, with the sound of tricycle approaching, Manager Ding arrived in front of Lao Deng. Lao Deng still maintained a fearless attitude, looking at Manager Ding.
0:49:34|0:49:38|Manager Ding approached with clasped hands and said.
0:49:42|0:49:50|After A Jun finished speaking, he lifted the white cloth covering the back of the tricycle.
0:50:49|0:50:56|[A Jun] and [Zhang Facai] watched the limousine full of beautiful women drive away, and then they told Manager Ding.
0:51:5|0:51:12|[A Jun] glanced at the dumbfounded [Zhang Facai] in front of him, then counted the money he had just exchanged for intelligence. At this moment, [A Shuai] walked over with blood all over his face.
0:51:12|0:51:17|[A Shuai] closed the car door and said to the two of them.
0:54:36|0:54:41|Facai pointed at the noodles in [A Jun]'s hand and said.
0:55:12|0:55:18|[Cheng Gong] looked at [Hu Liang] anxiously, gesturing for him to speak first. The dejected [Hu Liang], looking at [Xi Xi] who was very different from what he had imagined, began to speak incoherently.
0:55:33|0:55:37|At this moment, the director outside the studio answered the phone. Inside the studio, [Zha Yao] introduced.
0:55:51|0:55:59|Suddenly, fully armed special police rushed in and surrounded everyone. The three people in the car listening to the broadcast chuckled. [Cheng Gong] quickly turned off the sound of the broadcast.
0:56:4|0:56:9|Zha Yao, who wanted to rebel, was immediately stunned by an electric baton. After investigation, Zha Yao was found to be shirtless.
0:56:31|0:56:36|After coming out of the radio station, everyone in the car comforted [Zha Yao].
0:56:50|0:57:1|Later, they recalled their story at the tattoo shop. In the shop, [Zha Yao] gazed affectionately at [Li Meiyan], who took out a tattoo design and confirmed it with him.
0:57:10|0:57:16|After listening, [Li Meiyan] put down the pattern in her hand, looked at [Zha Yao] in front of her, hesitated for a while, and said softly.
0:57:20|0:57:26|After finishing the tattoo, [Zha Yao] looked in the mirror, and [Li Meiyan] mischievously tattooed the words "I love [Li Meiyan]" on his back. [Zha Yao] looked at it and said.
0:57:55|0:58:1|Zha Yao was so sure because he saw a photo of Li Meiyan and a big guitar on the wall while getting a tattoo.
0:58:55|0:59:3|At this moment, [Xi Xi] walked in crying and sat on the sofa. Seeing this, [Yang Shuangshu] who was wiping his precious guitar on the side, picked up some snacks and walked over to ask.
0:59:28|0:59:35|After seeing [Yang Shuangshu] walk away, [Hu Liang] and [Ding Jianguo] exchanged a smile. They then sneakily took [Yang Shuangshu]'s precious guitar to the second floor.
1:1:42|1:1:50|[Zhang Facai], who broke free, limped into the house.
1:2:5|1:2:8|[A Jun] kicked the door open and the two swaggered in.
1:2:28|1:2:37|At this moment, backstage of the school performance, [Cheng Gong] anxiously calls [Hu Liang]. Suddenly, [A Jun] picks up [Hu Liang]'s phone from the living room and casually throws it into the fish tank.
1:2:37|1:2:48|Shortly after, [A Jun] looked at the clothes on the bed, a mischievous idea came to mind. One by one, [Hu Liang]'s clothes floated out of the window. [A Jun] didn't even leave a single piece of underwear behind.
1:2:50|1:2:56|All thrown downstairs. After taking a shower, [Hu Liang] was ready to push the door open to go out, but unexpectedly, after [A Jun] threw the clothes, he also blocked the refrigerator at the bathroom door.
1:2:56|1:3:4|[Hu Liang] exerted all his strength to push open the door and found that his house had been ransacked. Outside the window, a van's trunk was holding his clothes, and he shouted.
1:3:8|1:3:15|On the other side, at the school, Cheng Gong said to Ding Jianguo. Ding Jianguo was encouraged by Cheng Gong.
1:3:20|1:3:25|After saying that, he turned and left. Back at home, Hu Liang, who had no clothes to wear, remembered that he had a performance today.
1:3:25|1:3:30|So he held up the tire with both hands to cover his private parts and kicked the landlord's door with his foot.
1:3:32|1:3:38|After the landlady opened the door, she saw [Hu Liang] standing there naked, and said in confusion.
1:3:58|1:4:2|Applause erupted from the audience. The temporary lead singer, [Ding Jianguo], took a deep breath and glanced at [Cheng Gong]. The two locked eyes.
1:5:25|1:5:31|Under the gaze of the crowd, [Cheng Gong] threw down his bicycle, jogged forward, took the microphone, and addressed the students below.
1:5:41|1:5:58|After the fantasy ended, [Hu Liang] tossed his hair and confidently rode his bicycle towards the stage. Just as he had imagined, under the attention of many students and teachers, he successfully rushed onto the stage. The front wheel of the bicycle was lifted high, but because [Hu Liang] was too heavy, he detached from the bicycle halfway through the jump.
1:5:58|1:6:5|Hu Liang fell heavily on the stage, and due to inertia, both he and the car continued to slide forward on the stage after falling.
1:6:5|1:6:11|People and cars knocked over all the equipment on the stage. [Cheng Gong] quickly ran onto the stage and anxiously spoke to the teachers and students below.
1:7:3|1:7:10|After learning about their growing reputation, the band members became much happier washing cars at the repair shop. The old fire truck was also graffitied by them to look very cool.
1:7:26|1:7:34|Hu Liang, who suddenly realized, had tears welling up in his eyes.
1:7:37|1:7:42|[Hu Liang] listened, dropped the cloth in his hand, didn't even wipe off the foam on his hands, and excitedly hugged [Cheng Gong].
1:7:42|1:7:49|Everyone looked at this scene and laughed happily for [Hu Liang]. [Cheng Gong] couldn't hide his joy either, and he hugged [Hu Liang] with a smile.
1:7:49|1:7:57|[Ding Jianguo] smiled and looked at [Cheng Gong] upstairs. In the evening, several adults were drinking under a big guitar, with [Yang Shuangshu] leaning against a sculpture.
1:7:57|1:8:5|Revealing their inner thoughts to the group, who were already drunk and swaying.
1:8:32|1:8:40|[Hu Liang] and a few others were already drunk, sitting on the ground, pouring their hearts out to each other.
1:8:40|1:8:48|[Cheng Gong] then walked over to [Ding Jianguo], who was sitting on the steps holding a guitar, with a bottle of wine in hand. When [Ding Jianguo] looked up and saw [Cheng Gong], the two men smiled at each other in recognition.
1:9:2|1:9:9|Ding Jianguo thought for a moment and placed the guitar on his lap, then picked up Cheng Gong's uninjured hand and placed it on the guitar strings.
1:9:9|1:9:18|And he moved closer to [Cheng Gong], placing his hand on the guitar fretboard. [Cheng Gong] smiled and began to play.
1:10:17|1:10:35|[Ding Jianguo] is like the hand of [Cheng Gong], the two of them cooperate tacitly and complete a simple melody.
1:10:35|1:10:43|[Ding Jianguo] also opened up the long-standing emotional barrier in [Cheng Gong]'s heart. As the music ended, the two of them gazed deeply at each other. After a long moment of eye contact,
1:10:43|1:10:53|Ding Jianguo took the initiative to kiss Cheng Gong, then shyly ran away. This sudden kiss, in Cheng Gong's imagination, was unexpected.
1:10:53|1:11:1|[Cheng Gong] turned to look at the limping [Ding Jianguo], then turned back with a smile of happiness on his face. As the sky grew darker,
1:11:1|1:11:13|Several people staggered home, and the next morning, [Cheng Gong] was still immersed in the happiness of love. Whistling, he returned to the repair shop from outside. Just as he took a few steps in, a luxury car also drove into the workshop.
1:11:13|1:11:21|The back seat of a luxury car happened to stop next to him, and the window slowly rolled down.
1:11:23|1:11:29|After that, he rolled up the car window and [Cheng Gong] stared wide-eyed at the scene in front of him. Then, the two arrived at a teahouse.
1:12:1|1:12:7|Finishing his words, he took out a bank card and placed it in front of [Cheng Gong]. [Cheng Gong] looked at the bank card on the table, feeling at a loss, and asked.
1:12:43|1:12:52|[Cheng Gong] lowered his head after listening, glanced at the bank card on the table, organized his words, and then said.
1:13:54|1:14:6|After chatting with [Ding Jianguo]'s father, [Cheng Gong] went to the rock park alone. Leaning against the railing, he lit a cigarette and quietly watched the large guitar sculpture. His mind was filled with various thoughts, pondering the words spoken by [Manager Ding].
1:14:53|1:14:56|Having experienced the gap between ideals and reality himself, [Cheng Gong] eventually compromised.
1:14:56|1:15:2|In the evening, after gathering the band together, it was announced that the performance was canceled.
1:15:16|1:15:23|After hearing the news, everyone fell silent with a sense of despair, and a suppressed atmosphere pervaded the repair shop as no one was willing to speak.
1:15:23|1:15:29|[Hu Liang], with tears in his eyes, said in disbelief.
1:15:31|1:15:35|Sitting silently on the stairs, [Ding Jianguo] seemed to have guessed the reason, staring fixedly at [Cheng Gong].
1:15:35|1:15:49|After returning home at night, Ding Jianguo used a slingshot to shatter the glass in Cheng Gong's room. Cheng Gong opened the window and looked down at Ding Jianguo with a bewildered expression.
1:15:49|1:15:58|While Ding Jianguo looked on with a deadpan expression, he gestured towards the taxi next to Cheng Gong after a moment.
1:15:58|1:16:5|They arrived at a construction site on the outskirts of Jiansan, where dozens of workers and large machines worked around the clock.
1:16:5|1:16:10|Accompanied by the roar of machinery, people toiled away, digging deep into the foundation.
1:16:10|1:16:14|People didn't communicate much, working under the illumination of spotlights.
1:16:14|1:16:21|At this moment, [Ding Jianguo] and [Cheng Gong] slowly stopped the taxi by the construction site. After getting out of the car, [Ding Jianguo] walked straight towards the foundation.
1:16:21|1:16:32|After getting off the car, [Cheng Gong] looked around in confusion, jogging to catch up with [Ding Jianguo]. [Ding Jianguo] remained silent as he looked at the excavator in the deep pit. After another round of inspection, [Cheng Gong] asked in puzzlement.
1:16:36|1:16:42|Jianguo raised his head and gestured for [Cheng Gong] to look at the person operating the excavator. To Cheng Gong's surprise, it turned out to be [Hu Liang].
1:17:4|1:17:12|After saying that, he looked disappointedly at [Cheng Gong] and then got into a taxi.
1:17:12|1:17:16|Cheng Gong watched the taxi drive away, wanting to say something but not knowing how to say it.
1:17:16|1:17:30|Suddenly, there was a loud noise in the sky, as if it struck Cheng Gong's heart. Cheng Gong looked up at the sky, then down at Hu Liang inside the excavator, feeling full of guilt. At this moment, Sun Dali called Cheng Gong.
1:17:30|1:17:34|Old Sun told Cheng Gong that the big guitar had been dismantled overnight.
1:17:36|1:17:43|Upon hearing the news, [Cheng Gong]'s face also instantly turned serious, and he ran all the way from the construction site to the rock park in the pouring rain.
1:17:43|1:17:52|The once magnificent giant guitar sculpture here, under the continuous gnawing of the large drilling rig, has become dilapidated, with debris constantly falling to the ground.
1:17:52|1:17:59|The strings of the guitar broke, leaning against the resonator, with only a few unbroken steel bars inside the hard cement supporting it.
1:17:59|1:18:3|Standing on the ground, the thick base is also being slowly destroyed.
1:18:3|1:18:11|At this moment, Hu Liang, who had received the news, ran over from the construction site in the rain and stood beside Cheng Gong, looking at the scene in front of him with a heart as cold as ashes.
1:18:11|1:18:18|[Cheng Gong] gave everything for the big guitar, and now he stands in front of the dilapidated sculpture, looking helpless like a child.
1:18:38|1:18:42|[Hu Liang] ran to the drilling rig in tears, hitting it while saying.
1:19:3|1:19:7|The three of them, although equally upset, still sensibly dragged the emotionally charged [Hu Liang] back.
1:19:8|1:19:12|[Hu Liang] still wanted to rush forward, trying to save the big guitar in an unrealistic way.
1:19:12|1:19:34|The pouring rain mixed with tears washed over several people, soaking [Cheng Gong] who was already wet. Looking at the tearful [Hu Liang], a sense of self-blame and sadness overwhelmed him, and he ran forward to shout at [Hu Liang].
1:19:44|1:19:52|After listening, [Hu Liang] gradually calmed down and asked.
1:19:56|1:20:2|[Cheng Gong]'s words hit [Hu Liang]'s heart like sharp thunder, one word at a time.
1:20:2|1:20:7|Hu Liang, who is struggling to accept the situation, stands still in a daze, feeling like his heart is being twisted by a knife.
1:20:7|1:20:15|Everyone looked at [Cheng Gong] disappointedly, and then [Hu Liang] walked over and punched [Cheng Gong] to the ground heavily.
1:20:16|1:20:25|[Cheng Gong] lay on the ground, allowing himself to be manipulated, and said to the three people holding [Hu Liang].
1:20:27|1:20:32|[Cheng Gong] tried to compensate [Hu Liang] in this way, seeking a little peace of mind in his own heart.
1:20:32|1:20:36|Riding on Cheng Gong, Hu Liang broke free from the crowd and glared at him furiously.
1:20:36|1:20:42|Then he shouted loudly, exerted all his strength, and heavily smashed his raised fist on the ground next to [Cheng Gong].
1:20:42|1:20:48|His fist, full of hatred and disappointment, came down, severing their friendship in an instant.
1:20:48|1:20:52|Hu Liang slowly got up, leaving Cheng Gong lying on the ground.
1:20:52|1:21:2|The fierce rain poured mercilessly on [Cheng Gong]'s face, making it impossible for him to open his eyes. This band, with a huge age span, came together with extremely fitting musical tacit understanding and a love for rock music.
1:21:2|1:21:10|The bright future was ruined by [Cheng Gong] himself. Lying on the ground, [Cheng Gong] recalled everything that had happened these days, filled with deep regret.
1:21:10|1:21:18|After getting up, [Hu Liang] took a deep breath to calm himself down. Then, dragging his soaking wet clothes, he walked aimlessly towards the ruins.
1:21:18|1:21:26|Arriving at the edge of the ruins, [Hu Liang] slowly squatted down, laboriously lifted a piece of wreckage from a large guitar, panting heavily, and continued to walk forward without looking back.
1:21:26|1:21:35|And [Cheng Gong], lying on the ground, finds it hard to forgive himself, lying motionless on the ground. On this night, this band, which could be called a miracle, also disbanded.
1:21:35|1:21:46|In the afternoon of the next day, [Cheng Gong] bought a ticket for the train back to Beijing, ready to leave. As he finished packing his luggage and prepared to leave, he couldn't help but look back at the small house that was once full of disdain.
1:21:46|1:21:50|Took another look at the group photo of when [Hu Liang] first arrived in Jiansan and stood in front of the big guitar.
1:21:50|1:21:56|When he left with his luggage, there were three thick stacks of cash left on the table as compensation for [Hu Liang].
1:21:56|1:22:2|As the sun sets, [Cheng Gong] stands in the train aisle, watching the scenery rapidly receding behind him, lost in thought.
1:22:2|1:22:15|After a long night of driving, the next day, Cheng Gong arrived in Beijing. Upon his return, he hurried to the band's rehearsal room, where he lowered his head and touched the thick dust on the drum set, looking at the desolate rehearsal room.
1:22:15|1:22:23|The mood became even heavier. When he got home at night, [Cheng Gong] opened his computer and found an email from [Hu Liang] in the inbox full of loan advertisements.
1:22:23|1:22:35|In the video, the once silly [Hu Liang] gradually welled up with tears, filled with apologies and longing, lost in thought. On the other side, far away in Jilin, [Hu Liang] experienced these things.
1:22:35|1:22:47|Returning to the daily life of the past, covered in oil and dust, lying on a skateboard, struggling to twist screws under the car. When unable to twist anymore, lying on the skateboard, tilting the head to look at the guitar placed against the wall.
1:22:47|1:22:56|After watching it, his expression relaxed significantly, as if the guitar could give him a constant stream of strength. In the rock park, the big guitar still retained its appearance from the heavy rain that day.
1:22:56|1:23:4|In the sunset, it looks particularly spectacular. At school, [Xi Xi] reluctantly gave up her rock and roll dream under the pressure from her mother.
1:23:4|1:23:13|Studying the knowledge about atomic bombs carefully on the desk. Ding Jianguo, who has experienced betrayal, also changed his previous fashion style and put on a mature suit.
1:23:15|1:23:31|She accepted the position of vice president, sitting in the conference room, but [Ding Jianguo]'s changes only stayed on the surface. Her rock-loving heart has never changed, and she played the guitar in the conference room without distraction. After the band disbanded, [Zha Yao] still did not give up on her original intention of coming to Jie'an, but instead confidently drummed in the crowded streets.
1:23:31|1:23:37|As an apprentice, Old Sun also dutifully followed behind, holding high the flag of finding [Zha Yao]'s true love.
1:23:37|1:23:46|Not long after the big guitar was dismantled, [Yang Shuangshu]'s daughter also learned about his band reformation. At the clinic, she discovered the secret base filled with guitars painted by [Yang Shuangshu].
1:23:54|1:24:0|After saying that, he sadly tilted his head to one side. Back in Beijing, [Cheng Gong] missed them every moment.
1:24:0|1:24:9|Sitting on the sofa in the training room, head down, recalling the events of these days, sleepless all night.
1:24:9|1:24:16|The next day, [Cheng Gong] took the Asian Wisdom Art Troupe, who were transforming into young fresh meat, to the airport.
1:24:16|1:24:25|Their car moved slowly on the congested road, with honking coming from all directions. The taxi driver looked at the three flamboyantly dressed individuals and made a sarcastic comment.
1:24:44|1:24:46|While [Cheng Gong] sat in the passenger seat with a look of disappointment on his face.
1:24:46|1:25:5|At this moment, [Cheng Gong] faintly heard the song sung by the Sewing Machine Band. After searching around, he looked out the window and saw two motorcyclists at the time, playing their music through speakers. The flags displayed slogans promoting the band as they maneuvered agilely through the streets and alleys of various cities.
1:25:9|1:25:26|Upon hearing this song, [Cheng Gong]'s eyes lit up, and he got out of the car with a completely different demeanor. At that moment, a motorcycle passed by in front of [Cheng Gong], who looked at the large sewing machine band on the flag, as well as the time and location of the concert. He stayed in place, recalling the words he had once thought were lies from [Hu Liang] and the others, which now seemed vivid in his mind.
1:25:26|1:25:32|Their appearance made [Cheng Gong] feel that in this world full of interests, there are also people who keep their verbal promises.
1:25:32|1:25:40|At this moment, [Cheng Gong]'s rock heart is completely awakened, he stares with wide eyes at the direction the knights are leaving, even his breathing becomes rapid.
1:25:40|1:25:46|Later, he took a taxi alone and arrived in Ji'an that night. In Ji'an, where there were no noisy sounds at night,
1:25:46|1:25:54|The taxi stopped steadily outside Hu Liang's repair shop. After paying the fare, Cheng Gong got out of the car and looked up at the sign of the repair shop.
1:25:54|1:25:58|His emotions were excited yet timid, difficult to express.
1:25:58|1:26:2|After watching quietly for a while, [Cheng Gong] finally gathered up the courage and walked in.
1:26:2|1:26:5|At this moment, [Hu Liang] was singing in the bathroom while taking a shower.
1:26:5|1:26:10|[Cheng Gong] slowly pushed open the door and looked at the room that had just been cleaned up, now in a mess again.
1:26:10|1:26:15|Clothes and shoes were randomly thrown on the dining table, with a mountain of garbage piled up on the floor.
1:26:15|1:26:18|At this moment, Cheng Gong noticed that the torn guitar band poster on the wall was removed by Hu Liang.
1:26:20|1:26:24|Cheng Gong remained silent for a moment, then tilted his head to see a new shelf on the wall.
1:26:24|1:26:34|In the shelf, placed there was the large guitar fragment that [Hu Liang] picked up from the ruins in the rain, followed by a plaque underneath with the words "Rock is Dead" boldly written on it.
1:26:34|1:26:43|[Cheng Gong] sighed, then squatted down to tidy up [Hu Liang]'s clothes. At this moment, [Hu Liang], who heard the noise, held a trash can in one hand and a plunger in the other.
1:26:43|1:26:46|He forcefully slammed the trash can onto [Cheng Gong]'s head.
1:27:7|1:27:15|In the moment of taking off the trash can, [Hu Liang] seemed startled and took two steps back, looking at [Cheng Gong] who was almost knocked unconscious. He quickly threw away the plunger in his hand.
1:27:15|1:27:26|After tidying up, [Cheng Gong] lit three sticks of incense, bowed towards the memorial tablet, and placed them in the incense burner. Then he sat on the chair, looking at [Hu Liang] who was deliberately avoiding his gaze. The two remained silent for a while, until [Cheng Gong] organized his words and spoke.
1:28:57|1:29:6|While speaking, he took out a wad of cash and threw it on the table.
1:29:21|1:29:30|Finishing speaking, [Cheng Gong] took out Hu Liang's necklace and continued. Hu Liang looked up at his faith, hesitating.
1:29:30|1:29:38|[Cheng Gong] asked again. [Hu Liang], with moist eyes, took a deep breath and said.
1:29:54|1:29:59|The next day, the two of them, rejuvenated like newborns, energetically got back on their fire truck.
1:29:59|1:30:6|[Hu Liang] put on his necklace again, and after high-fiving, they went to visit other members of the band separately. Meanwhile, over at [Manager Ding]'s place.
1:30:6|1:30:13|His men handed the card that Cheng Gong had received at the time to him, at this moment, the Sewing Machine Band had no more constraints.
1:30:13|1:30:20|After the fire truck filled with rock and roll vibes circled around Jianshi City, several people successively got on the truck and continued their enthusiastic search inside.
1:30:20|1:30:30|The last stop was right under Xi Xi's building, and Xi Xi was about to climb out of the window.
1:30:58|1:31:5|Upon finishing speaking, [Qiao Dashan] glared at [Xi Xi]'s mother who was breathing nervously, while Xi Xi's mother looked at him disdainfully, ready to confront him at any moment.
1:31:5|1:31:9|Qiao Dashan pulled a bank card out of his hair.
1:31:12|1:31:18|[Xi Xi]'s mother quickly stepped forward to take the bank card, looked at it carefully, and then raised her eyes to ask.
1:31:19|1:31:32|Facing the questioning from [Xi Xi]'s mother, [Qiao Dashan] panted heavily, then resolutely searched through his hair.
1:31:41|1:31:46|After speaking, he walked towards the car, and several people looked at [Xi Xi] walking out openly in disbelief.
1:31:46|1:31:52|At this moment, the final piece of the band puzzle is also in place.
1:32:7|1:32:18|[Cheng Gong] looked a bit embarrassed at the group of people who showed no signs of nervousness. At that moment, as their car passed a corner, it was blocked by a van in front. Soon after, two more vans stopped at the back, cutting off their retreat.
1:32:20|1:32:25|In an instant, a dozen thugs with sticks rushed out and blocked the fire truck. At this moment, [Zhang Facai] in the truck placed a bag of cash in front of the gang leader and said.
1:32:36|1:32:42|Putting on a horse mask that had been prepared in advance, [Cheng Gong] finished speaking.
1:33:32|1:33:37|At the command of [Zhang Facai], dozens of thugs swarmed in, and [Cheng Gong] immediately turned around to close the door of the fire truck.
1:33:37|1:33:40|Soon after, the two of them began to face a group of over a dozen people attacking them.
1:33:40|1:33:47|[Hu Liang] took the lead, carrying a person with his strong physique and charging forward fiercely. The previous encirclement was also broken up by [Hu Liang].
1:33:47|1:33:57|Quick-witted Cheng Gong swiftly dove under the car as the enemy's clubs swung towards him. Emerging from the other side, Cheng Gong evaded the enemy's gunfire and pulled out the fire truck's water bag, whipping it towards the enemy like a belt.
1:33:57|1:34:3|When Hu Liang couldn't hold on any longer, Zha Yao climbed onto the top of the fire truck and provided timely support with a high-pressure water gun.
1:34:3|1:34:11|In an instant, everyone was sprayed and scattered. On the other side of the car, Cheng Gong was still fighting hard with the water bag. Although the water bag had a long attack range, he was facing a siege of more than a dozen people.
1:34:11|1:34:13|Still no significant advantage has been gained.
1:34:13|1:34:20|[Zha Yao] saw the situation and quickly changed direction to spray towards the enemies near [Cheng Gong]. At this moment, [Hu Liang], who broke out of the encirclement, ran to the side of the car and opened the valve.
1:34:20|1:34:31|The water bag that was just deflated suddenly swelled up, spraying [Zhang Facai] who was close by into the air. While [Zhang Facai] was still groaning on the ground, [Hu Liang] ran to [Cheng Gong]'s side, and the two of them together controlled the high-pressure water gun.
1:34:31|1:34:40|Facing the two high-pressure water guns on the ground and above, the oncoming enemies were knocked down one by one. Just as the fighting was intense and exhilarating, an enemy quietly crawled up from behind [Zha Yao].
1:34:44|1:34:54|The huge impact caused [Zha Yao] to sit paralyzed on the car roof. As the thug swung the bat again, [Ding Jianguo] accurately struck and knocked down the enemy. The two under the car continued to spray with a water gun, but found the water flow gradually weakening.
1:34:56|1:35:3|The two looked at the henchmen lying on the ground wailing, dropped the water gun, and at this moment, [Ding Jianguo] found that the marbles in his briefcase had also been shot out.
1:35:3|1:35:13|[Zha Yao] sat helplessly on the roof of the car, suffering from serious injuries. At this moment, the henchmen who were knocked down by the water gun gradually regained consciousness and stood up from the ground. They watched as the few people who were out of ammunition charged towards them again.
1:35:13|1:35:25|At the critical moment, [Xi Xi] opened the car door, while [Yang Shuangshu], wearing sunglasses, rushed towards the oncoming enemies with a fire extinguisher in hand. In an instant, the thick powder from the extinguisher enveloped everyone, making it impossible for the thugs facing it to keep their eyes open.
1:35:26|1:35:35|[Cheng Gong] and [Hu Liang] seized the opportunity and rushed towards the thugs without hesitation. Everyone was beaten badly, and as they just recovered, they looked at the thick smoke and powder, unable to distinguish the two for a moment.
1:35:37|1:35:39|And at this moment, wearing a horse-faced mask, the conspicuous [Zhang Facai] became the target of the two.
1:35:40|1:35:47|[Cheng Gong] grabbed the long mask, while [Hu Liang] struck fiercely behind him. As the dust from the fire extinguisher gradually dispersed, [Zhang Facai] was also subdued by the two of them.
1:36:7|1:36:14|Just as [Hu Liang] was about to remove the mask, he was knocked over by [Zhang Facai].
1:36:14|1:36:19|[Cheng Gong] quickly sprayed the fire extinguisher at the approaching thugs. Then, [Cheng Gong] untied the rope holding a large number of iron barrels nearby.
1:36:20|1:36:27|The iron barrel rolled down, smashing towards the thugs, buying time for the band members to escape, but the thugs who quickly regrouped also chased after them with all their might.
1:36:27|1:36:38|Several people ran for a while, but with the team carrying guitars and elderly and children, they couldn't run fast. Just as they were about to be caught up, they stopped. Two groups of people on horseback rushed out from both sides of the intersection ahead.
1:36:38|1:36:44|On the left, charging out are the demolition team led by [Ding Jianguo]'s father. On the right, charging out are the taekwondo team led by [Xi Xi]'s mother.
1:36:44|1:36:50|At that time in the car, Zha Yao and Xi Xi were the first to call their parents.
1:36:51|1:36:55|Then the two teams turned the corner and rushed towards the road where [Cheng Gong] was located.
1:36:55|1:37:2|Manager Ding led the demolition team, all wearing sunglasses and suits, while Xi Xi's mother led the taekwondo team, all dressed in martial arts uniforms.
1:37:2|1:37:10|The black and white teams rushed towards the enemies behind them, passing by the band members without saying a word, and immediately engaged in a fight with the enemies.
1:38:2|1:38:7|With several people shouting in unison, a rock concert full of passion is about to begin.
1:38:7|1:38:19|Several people carrying large guitar cases climbed over the rubble of the guitar and stood in their respective positions on the highest steps. They stared blankly at the construction site below, where the once crowded square had become dilapidated.
1:38:19|1:38:26|Several people looked particularly sad at the empty audience below the stage. The blood stains on the face of the lead singer [Hu Liang] had not been wiped clean yet.
1:38:26|1:38:34|He lowered his head with a low mood, clenched his teeth, and breathed heavily. After adjusting for a while, he looked towards [Cheng Gong] behind the stage.
1:38:34|1:38:40|With a determined look in his eyes, [Cheng Gong] slowly raised his right arm towards [Hu Liang], making a rock gesture.
1:38:40|1:38:46|[Hu Liang] nodded when he saw it. At this moment, the words he said in his childhood echoed in [Hu Liang]'s ears.
1:38:57|1:39:4|Hu Liang then started playing music on the empty stage.
1:40:18|1:40:36|[Hu Liang] sang with closed eyes, recalling the joys and sorrows of the band's journey from formation to the present in his mind.
1:40:36|1:40:46|They perform enthusiastically at nursing homes, construction sites, and schools. They sway their bodies along with the music in the car, and play music in perfect harmony at the repair shop.
1:40:46|1:40:53|Excitedly embracing each other upon receiving the government performance invitation, drinking on the rooftop, standing side by side, shouting towards the city.
1:41:32|1:41:41|At this moment, the tightly secured factory gate kept swinging back and forth.
1:41:41|1:41:50|As the security guard opened the gate, numerous musicians from Anji and rock music enthusiasts flooded in, carrying guitars and drum sets, rushing to the stage shouting like crazy.
1:41:50|1:41:54|People filled the empty land in a matter of seconds.
1:41:55|1:41:59|In the excited atmosphere, the members of the Broken Guitar band also arrived at the scene on motorcycles.
1:44:43|1:44:58|As the people on stage began to accompany, all the guitarists and drummers below tacitly lined up, playing the same song together. The audience members without instruments also intuitively stood at the back, opening their phone flashlights to show support.
1:44:58|1:45:21|Cheng Gong, who couldn't break through his own inner defense line, shook his head with tears in his eyes. But with the accompaniment of everyone's voices and Hu Liang's continuous encouragement, Cheng Gong roared and rushed onto the stage.
1:47:59|1:48:5|After a long time, [Xi Xi] recited the story of the band to everyone at school.
1:48:26|1:48:32|The day after the performance, several members of the band came to the train station to see off Cheng Gong.
1:48:46|1:48:55|When walking to the carriage, [Cheng Gong] turned around reluctantly and waved goodbye to everyone, looking at them with deep reluctance.
1:48:55|1:49:12|When preparing to step into the carriage, [Ding Jianguo] stood still in place, dressed in high heels and a long coat, carrying a guitar and a suitcase, walking slowly towards [Cheng Gong], completely different from his usual style. Seeing such a ladylike [Ding Jianguo], [Cheng Gong] was surprised, staring wide-eyed and frozen in place.
1:49:12|1:49:18|Although his attire has changed, [Ding Jianguo] still maintains his cool personality, calmly watching [Cheng Gong].
1:49:27|1:49:35|With that, he dropped his luggage, walked into the carriage gracefully, and [Cheng Gong] looked at the luggage rack, then smiled and gestured to everyone.
1:49:35|1:49:39|After recalling these memories, [Xi Xi] with [Hu Liang]'s necklace continued her speech.
1:49:55|1:49:57|Everyone shouted and stood up excitedly, jumping around.
1:49:57|1:50:2|The rock and roll passion here is passed down from generation to generation, just like the necklace on [Xi Xi].
1:50:4|1:50:11|Although the big guitar was dismantled, after the exciting concert, the entire Ji'an City was filled with a strong rock atmosphere.
1:50:11|1:50:16|In this city that loves rock music, even the shape of the school resembles a giant guitar.
1:50:16|1:50:22|As the school's exterior slowly unfolds, the film is about to say goodbye to you here. Thank you for listening.
1:50:23|1:50:28|At the end of the film, we will bring you a movie Easter egg and a special performance.
1:50:28|1:50:53|The hostess of Jiansan Elementary School is played by [Singing Legend] from the Knight Band, the leading doctor is played by [Liu Yijun] from the Tang Dynasty Band, the warehouse manager is played by [Long Long] from the 43 Baojia Street Band, the onlookers at Jiansan Train Station are played by [Gao Hu] from the Pain Band, the Harley female rider is played by [Xiao Nan] from the Cobra Band, and the person in charge of the Jiansan Nursing Home is played by [Lei Gang] from the Paradise Band.
1:50:53|1:51:16|The construction worker is played by [Cheng Gong] from the band OK King, the nail house owner Lao Deng is played by [Hu Liang] from the band Black Panther, Lao Deng's brother is played by [Ding Jianguo] from the band The Face, the radio broadcaster is played by [Zha Yao] from the band New Pants, the SWAT team leader is played by [Yang Shuangshu] from the band Overload, and the taxi driver is played by [Xi Xi] from the band Second Hand Roses.
1:51:18|1:51:24|The leader of the thugs is played by Xiao Wei from the band "Watchmen of the Wheat Field". It is worth noting that these people are all real members of the band and true rockers.
1:51:26|1:51:32|Next, let me introduce the post-credits scene. After the exciting performance that evening, several people were happily eating hot pot at the repair shop.
1:52:13|1:52:15|Later, recalling the encounter at the tattoo shop.
1:52:15|1:52:21|When asked for her name, Tongtong looked down and smelled the fragrance on [Zha Yao]'s fingers, mistaking it for another girl, so she deliberately said.
