0:1:26|0:1:36|On this day, the sky was clear and the air was refreshing. In the training ground of Luoyang City, the imperial guards were lined up in front of the main hall, with palace maids holding decorative umbrellas and fans, ready to escort the imperial carriage.
0:1:36|0:1:44|On the side, the Emperor [Tang Gao Zong] and the Empress [Wu Zetian] of the Great Tang Dynasty, dressed in luxurious clothes, with a majestic demeanor, stood in the palace, overlooking the bustling city below.
0:1:44|0:1:55|A person wearing a black gauze hat and court attire, kneeling to express gratitude for the imperial favor. Then, lifting the bestowed Dragon God's Scepter with both hands, slowly standing up, facing the soldiers in the formation to show the authority of [Tang Gao Zong].
0:1:55|0:2:3|This is Di Renjie, the chief of the Supreme Court of Tang Dynasty, responsible for handling the most important judicial affairs of the country.
0:2:3|0:2:16|The investigation of all unsolved cases is handled by the Supreme Court, equivalent to the current Supreme People's Court. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is honored as the director, with the saying "The overbearing dragon surpasses the emperor, when the true dragon retreats far away, it implies negligence in court affairs."
0:2:16|0:2:27|The Dragon Spine symbolizes fairness and justice, impartiality. All the people of the Tang Dynasty, from commoners to officials, even members of the royal family who harm the state, can be admonished with the Dragon Spine.
0:2:27|0:2:42|The scene shifts to the Dali Temple, where [Di Renjie] is holding a piece of soft wood, covering his hand on his back and standing under an apricot tree. He continuously lashes the fallen apricot leaves, and the ground is covered with leaves, all intact and crisp.
0:2:42|0:2:50|The leaves fluttering in the air, [Di Renjie] also missed his strike. His skills were impressive, but it was unclear what his intention was in practicing martial arts like this.
0:2:50|0:2:58|In another part of the imperial palace, during the mealtime, [Wu Zetian] was furious and threw the precious dishes and delicacies on the table to the ground.
0:2:58|0:3:5|[Tang Gao Zong] did not take offense, he smiled and stepped back, while [Wu Zetian] stood up and glared at [Tang Gao Zong], saying,
0:3:12|0:3:16|After saying that, [Wu Zetian] kicked away the bowls and wine cups at her feet and walked out of the hall.
0:3:43|0:4:0|Upon hearing what [Tang Gao Zong] said, [Wu Zetian] stopped in her tracks and turned to look at him, her expression still stubborn but with tears in her eyes. As a series of hurried hoofbeats echoed, night fell upon the palace.
0:4:42|0:4:51|At this point, [Yuchi Zhenjin] led [Wu Zetian] to a courtyard.
0:5:12|0:5:19|[Wu Zetian] said this, and then saw the four people kneeling in the dark courtyard getting up, the leader wearing a coarse cloth robe and a crown on his head.
0:5:19|0:5:27|Stepping forward a few steps, he flicked the duster in his hand and unexpectedly grew out two arms from his back. Reaching up into the air, he clenched his fists and two fireballs leaped onto the palms of his hands.
0:5:27|0:5:40|Then he threw it to the ground for illumination. Beside [Huan Tian], a strong man walked in the firelight, only to see him wielding the double-crescent moon blades and roaring forward. [Yuchi Zhenjin] feared his treacherous intentions, which would harm [Wu Zetian].
0:5:40|0:5:50|With swords drawn to protect her, the barbarian man in the group threw his weapon into the air and charged towards [Wu Zetian]. [Yuchi Zhenjin] intercepted halfway, spinning his blade to solely defend.
0:5:50|0:6:3|Suddenly, the Moon Twin Blades disappeared in front of him, then attacked from behind. He quickly dodged and the barbarian man from the Fan tribe called back the twin blades on his back, bowing and saying.
0:6:3|0:6:22|Then an old woman with a ghostly face raised her hand, and sparks filled the air wherever her palms faced. With unparalleled heat, she thrust her palms towards the sky, and the sparks bloomed like brilliant fireworks in the night sky. Looking up, one could see Sanskrit burning in the night sky, and upon closer inspection, it was revealed that the Sanskrit pointed to Bodhisattva Samantabhadra.
0:6:28|0:6:31|The old woman's level of skill made [Wu Zetian] take notice.
0:6:33|0:6:55|The spark faded, and a strange man dressed as a scholar appeared, waving his sleeves to conjure up wine bottles and jugs out of thin air, placing them on the table. He then flicked his hand to send a wine cup floating gently onto the blade of [Yuchi Zhenjin], saying as he did so. He poured from the silver jug, but the wine seemed to flow endlessly without a source.
0:6:55|0:7:2|Surely enough, as the wine cup on the knife gradually filled up, [Yuchi Zhenjin] raised his knife and forcefully split the wine cup in half, shouting,
0:7:10|0:7:17|After listening, Yuchi Zhenjin walked up to the Empress and bowed, saying,
0:7:53|0:7:59|He suddenly felt that the shadow of Empress Wu was strange, and when he looked sideways, he saw ripples flowing in the darkness.
0:7:59|0:8:10|[Yuchi Zhenjin] shouted loudly. Then, he drew his long knife from his waist and pointed it towards the mysterious figure in the dark. Seeing the approaching soldiers with knives, the Empress suddenly extended an arm from her shadow, controlling the flying darts.
0:8:10|0:8:31|Di Renjie deflected the long knife, and Yuchi Zhenjin leaped into the air, throwing several flying knives to force the person out of the shadow of the Empress. Holding two knives, he was about to capture the night walker when the person lightly stepped on the ground, floating into the air. Regardless of others, this light skill was truly extraordinary. The night walker was skilled in using hidden weapons, continuously throwing flying darts and entangling with Yuchi Zhenjin.
0:8:31|0:8:43|Seizing the opportunity, Di Renjie used his unparalleled light skills to fly onto the city tower. Just as he had not yet stabilized his figure, Yuchi Zhenjin threw a flying knife, nailing it along with the veil of the night walker to the railing of the city tower.
0:8:43|0:8:52|The outcome is clear. The Nightwalker retreated, his black robe floating down as he spoke. [Yuchi Zhenjin] paid no attention, sheathed his sword, and engaged in conversation.
0:9:31|0:9:36|The Empress's words concealed a deep mystery, and after hearing them, [Yuchi Zhenjin] shuddered and fell silent.
0:9:56|0:10:7|The officials were slightly puzzled, but then they immediately rode with [Di Renjie] to rush to Lengyuzhai. Just out of the Dali Temple, the whereabouts of the crowd had already entered the eyes of the alien race under the command of the Empress.
0:10:7|0:10:15|When Di Renjie left, Yuchi Zhenjin sat on the horse and threw a paper package to the hunched old woman who was good at making fire, then said.
0:10:22|0:10:25|[Gui Ye] remained silent, just staring at him with a sinister smile.
0:10:25|0:10:32|Yuchi Zhenjin rode away as if he hadn't seen it, and at this moment, a spell appeared on the ground, faintly visible.
0:10:32|0:10:49|In the corner tower, the female assassin [Shui Yue], who was responsible for monitoring the movements of the Dali Temple, sensed something amiss. She flipped over and leaped down from the corner tower beam, leaning against the platform to observe. Below, in the bustling market, pedestrians and carriages hurried past, all unaware of the unusual activity on the ground. Seeing [Gui Ye] ascend the corner tower, [Shui Yue] spoke up and asked,
0:10:54|0:11:8|[Gui Ye] remained silent, grinning, as the camera followed his sinister laughter to the outside of the Cold Jade Chamber. The night was deep, and in the courtyard, three guards were holding lanterns, waiting.
0:11:8|0:11:12|Di Renjie rode up, and the group led everyone into the Cold Jade Chamber.
0:11:49|0:12:7|Stepping over the threshold, he looked around and saw numerous clues left by the criminals in the courtyard. The mansion gate was broken, footprints were clear in the courtyard. These traces, seen by [Di Renjie], became tools for solving the case. In just a few moments, he had already imagined the whereabouts of the perpetrator in his mind.
0:12:7|0:12:22|They are numerous in number, and early this morning they forcibly broke into the Cold Jade Chamber when no one was around, showing no restraint. They then leaped and jumped around in the pine forest, strange rocks, narrow paths, and low walls in the courtyard, exposing numerous flaws and leaving behind countless traces.
0:12:22|0:12:34|[Di Renjie] felt strange and stopped to observe the courtyard. He deduced the movements of the criminals one by one in his mind. Suddenly, he saw a countless number of black-clothed figures coming and going inside the Cold Jade Chamber, as if a world of his own was formed in his mind, with day and night alternating.
0:12:34|0:12:41|After confirming that there were no omissions, [Di Renjie] entered the room with others and found numerous traces in the hall.
0:12:41|0:12:44|[Di Renjie] couldn't help but speak up, saying,
0:12:48|0:12:56|Upon hearing what [Di Renjie] said, a police officer was about to speak but was interrupted by another who waved his hand, while [Yuchi Zhenjin] stood outside the door, smiling without saying a word.
0:12:56|0:13:4|Di Renjie and his companions' conversation startled the master of Lengyuzhai. At this moment, he was like a frightened bird, sitting behind the conversation table, shouting in panic,
0:13:14|0:13:34|While the police officer was questioning Mr. Leng according to the law, [Di Renjie] crouched down with interest to examine a footprint on the ground. At the same time, outside the Dali Temple, [Gui Ye] and [Shui Yue] took advantage of the darkness to prepare to sneak into the temple to find the Dragon Spine Staff. The two of them leaped from the market canopy into the air, disappearing without a trace.
0:13:38|0:13:49|Just as the staying conductor was attracted by the twinkling stars in the sky, two figures wrapped in black cloth descended from above, falling into the Grand Court of Justice like scattered night.
0:13:49|0:14:0|It is [Gui Ye] and [Shui Yue], who then avoided the patrolling guards by turning into a cloud of smoke, following the route instructed by [Yuchi Zhenjin], they silently sneaked into [Di Renjie]'s residence.
0:14:16|0:14:24|Gui Ye finished speaking and took the lead in searching the bedroom, while on the other side, the police officer was still questioning Mr. Leng about relevant matters.
0:15:18|0:15:22|The nearby Di Renjie hurriedly lit a lamp to inspect, only to see a painting fall out from under the table.
0:15:24|0:15:30|Fearful of hidden secrets under the table, Di Renjie kicked over the drawing table with one foot, alerting his companions outside.
0:15:40|0:15:54|[Di Renjie] saw the situation and hurriedly shouted at him, but it was already too late, the fellow officer had been eroded by the poison. Another officer drew out a steel rod for self-defense. [Di Renjie] instructed his subordinates to be vigilant.
0:15:56|0:16:5|Outside the house, the well-trained police officers rely on each other, checking the surroundings with the crossbows on their waists. At this moment, [Di Renjie] suddenly foams at the mouth, convulses, and dies.
0:16:8|0:16:23|Two railway police officers were about to step forward to help, but suddenly realized the situation, so they loudly warned everyone. Amidst the chaos, [Di Renjie] remained remarkably calm. He listened intently and suddenly heard a faint noise from the roof. He raised his head to observe, just as the two railway police officers were examining Mr. Leng's body.
0:16:23|0:16:32|[Di Renjie] shouted to the crowd inside and outside. Sure enough, as soon as he finished speaking, the patrol outside discovered a figure in a black robe walking on the roof.
0:16:32|0:16:44|So the crossbow continuously fired and hit the person, who fell into the courtyard. The thick smoke on the roof dispersed, revealing a figure, it was none other than the skilled [Fei Yan] from the group of extraordinary individuals.
0:17:43|0:17:50|[Huan Tian] intercepted [Ba Dao], who was about to engage in combat with [Yuchi Zhenjin], then leaped towards the wall and turned into a mist, disappearing from sight.
0:17:50|0:18:2|[Ba Dao], who is not good at illusion techniques, carries two knives on his back and leaves by leaping and running on walls. On the other side, [Di Renjie] leads the police to continue chasing [Fei Yan] with Officer Yi An, just as it is curfew in the dimly lit city of Luoyang in the Tang Dynasty.
0:18:2|0:18:12|The streets were empty, with four people chasing each other. When Di Renjie ran out of sight, Fei Yan leaped down from the roof and used magic to transform into women's clothing in mid-air before quietly landing.
0:18:12|0:18:19|Little did Di Renjie know that behind him were Yuchi An and Zhou Jin, two police officers, who discovered him trapped in the alley at that moment.
0:18:19|0:18:26|[Di Renjie] realized that no one was following him, so he knew the plan was successful and hurried back to this place.
0:18:30|0:18:47|After Yichi An and Zhou Jin tied up [Fei Yan], Di Renjie kicked her out without hesitation. A spherical hidden weapon rolled towards the three of them, small but incredibly powerful. With just one kick, it could shatter walls and tiles, truly terrifying. The others quickly dodged out of the way.
0:18:49|0:18:57|[Fei Yan] finished speaking and, ignoring the ropes still wrapped around him, engaged in a fierce battle with [Di Renjie]. Seeing movement in the hidden weapons on the wall, Yi An shouted loudly.
0:19:0|0:19:11|As soon as the words fell, several hidden weapons were seen attached to the wall, opening up like lotus flowers, with light balls hidden inside, spraying out an unnamed liquid towards Zhou Jin and Yi An, making it difficult for the two of them to break free for the time being.
0:19:11|0:19:22|Fortunately, [Di Renjie] is skilled in martial arts, constantly suppressing [Fei Yan]. Feeling unable to gain the upper hand, [Fei Yan] found it difficult and decided to fly back to create some distance. When trying to use his inner strength, he realized that his hands were as hard as iron and couldn't move for a moment.
0:19:22|0:19:29|In recalling the recent battle, it was just noticed that in Di Renjie's hand, the soft wooden stick was hitting all the acupuncture points on his body.
0:19:29|0:19:42|At this moment, looking back at the skills [Di Renjie] practiced under the apricot tree, it is indeed a superior kung fu. Although the apricot leaves are intact, the meridians within have been severed. Beside him, Yi An and Zhou Jin also avoided the nameless liquid to escape from the trap.
0:19:42|0:19:51|[Fei Yan] saw the three men joining forces, realizing she was no match for them. She then displayed her illusion technique by waving her sleeves in front of her, creating a misty and eerie atmosphere before disappearing from the sight of the others.
0:19:55|0:20:2|On a wooden frame, [Fei Yan] appeared, attracting everyone's attention. [Di Renjie] quickly climbed the beam to the top floor to search for her trace.
0:20:13|0:20:37|The lantern spontaneously spins, and with a slight thought, it is known to be a trick. Shouting urgently, as [Di Renjie] expected, this place was set up with a mechanism by [Fei Yan] at some point. The large lantern is filled with an unnamed liquid similar to the spherical hidden weapon, which now sprays out, corroding everything it touches, creating a burst of smoke.
0:20:48|0:20:58|[Fei Yan] took a desperate gamble, but still couldn't get rid of the vigilant [Di Renjie]. On the other side, [Shui Yue] finally made a discovery. In the hidden compartment of the box, the imperial bestowed Dragon-Taming Mace lay quietly inside.
0:20:58|0:21:2|Looking at the divine rod, [Shui Yue] couldn't help but say to the person beside her, [Gui Ye],
0:21:4|0:21:12|As soon as [Shui Yue] drew the Konglong Rod, she felt something was wrong, as there were hidden lines connected to the rod.
0:21:18|0:21:37|Three pottery jars fell and shattered on the eaves, alerting the guards. The Konglong Staff was also broken into pieces, revealing it to be a fake. Realizing they had been tricked, the two tried to escape but were trapped by a large net falling from above. [Di Renjie] had anticipated this, leaving them in a state of panic and unable to move within the net. Shortly after, several police officers arrived with swords drawn, standing guard outside the house.
0:21:37|0:21:48|In [Di Renjie]'s bedroom, thick smoke billowed out through the cracks of the door and windows, but there was no flame, which was quite strange. Everyone rushed in, and inside the room, the thick smoke obscured their vision. It was only when they got closer that they discovered,
0:21:48|0:21:58|On the ground lies an empty net, the bound person has disappeared without a trace. The leading officer slowly reads aloud the note drawn from the brocade bag.
0:23:24|0:23:30|The empress dowager flew into a rage and unintentionally revealed the secret of the Tang Dynasty, causing [Yuchi Zhenjin] to kneel and remain silent.
0:23:30|0:23:37|In the Great Court, [Di Renjie] stayed up late, seemingly troubled by inner demons, sitting at the table, reminiscing about the past.
0:23:53|0:24:9|This is the Sanzang Temple, where [Di Renjie] is extremely respectful, kneeling on the ground and reaching out to the monk. The monk uses his finger as a brush to write and draw on his palm. When the monk stops writing, [Di Renjie] slowly speaks,
0:24:49|0:24:55|Recalling the words of the apprentice [Yuan Ce], and thinking of the tragic death of the victim poisoned in Lengyuzhai today.
0:24:55|0:25:3|[Di Renjie] suddenly felt a congestion of true qi in his chest and abdomen, his blood boiling, causing unbearable pain. At this moment, there was a police officer knocking on the door outside.
0:25:10|0:25:29|The police officer heard a muffled groan from inside the room, fearing something was amiss, he broke in and couldn't help but exclaim in surprise, only to see [Di Renjie] fainted on the mat. This police officer, known as [Shatuo], is a physician among them, who once worked with [Di Renjie] to solve the case of the Dragon King in the capital, their relationship is inseparable, hence he privately refers to Di as "Old Di". [Shatuo] came to visit late at night, though the reason was unknown.
0:25:29|0:25:36|When he fell ill, he was treated with acupuncture. Di Renjie woke up from time to time, helped him sit up, and Shatuo Zhong spoke up.
0:25:57|0:26:19|Just as the two were talking, [Wu Zetian] arrived at a secluded cave in the wilderness with [Yuchi Zhenjin] and a maid. The thunder roared and the rain poured down, as if there were demons. After [Wu Zetian] finished speaking, she turned and walked alone into the cave. As she walked away, the maid timidly asked, and [Yuchi Zhenjin] replied,
0:26:52|0:27:2|In no time, [Wu Zetian] had already arrived in the prison cell and spoke to the underground,
0:27:10|0:27:17|Outside the cave, Di Renjie pushes away the palace maid, and in the dungeon, Faceless Monkey speaks up.
0:27:46|0:27:59|Listening to what [Wu Zetian] said, whether it is the current power struggle or the recruitment of outsiders to counter the Great Li Ministry, it is all part of the scheme of this faceless monkey. [Yuchi Zhenjin] sneaked into the mansion and listened carefully to the movements inside.
0:28:20|0:28:29|Behind the cave wall, [Yuchi Zhenjin] heard the words of [Wu Zetian], his face extremely solemn, as if lost in thought.
0:28:38|0:28:49|Early the next morning, [Yuchi Zhenjin] led [Wu Zetian] to the Dali Temple to practice, where a four-foot bamboo pole was erected on a flat surface, with a circular platform on top tied with a hemp rope.
0:28:49|0:29:1|Di Renjie was clinging to a hemp rope and climbing up towards the teeth of the two spires, hanging in the middle of the furnace. Below his feet, numerous poisonous scorpions were unable to withstand the heat of the furnace and followed closely behind. All the police officers in the temple surrounded and watched as he climbed up.
0:29:1|0:29:4|Du Danhan, the martial arts of [Di Renjie] can be seen.
0:29:4|0:29:20|Fortunately, with his strong martial arts skills, the poisonous scorpion never managed to catch up with Di Renjie, only causing distress to Shatuo Zhong who was watching on the side. Such a unique training method was unheard of, as he walked straight towards Yuchi Zhenjin and spoke.
0:30:0|0:30:27|At this moment, [Di Renjie] stood on the platform, but the bamboo pole was flexible and difficult to balance. When [Shatuo Zhong] shouted, [Di Renjie] couldn't stand steady and fell off the platform. The people below hurriedly reached out to catch him, and [Yuchi Zhenjin] also looked tense. He leaped down, only to see [Di Renjie] clamping the hemp rope between his legs in mid-air, then he flipped and swayed, landing on the ground unharmed.
0:30:46|0:30:57|Seeing [Shatuo Zhong] unharmed, [Di Renjie] turned around and smiled, saying, upon hearing this, [Yuchi Zhenjin] became more thoughtful, his face tightened involuntarily, then followed [Di Renjie]. The two arrived at the bedroom, [Yuchi Zhenjin] slowed down, cautiously stepping in.
0:30:59|0:31:6|Looking around, one could see traces of a large fire burning on the wooden floor, whether it was yet to be repaired or intentionally left that way.
0:31:6|0:31:10|[Di Renjie] searched through the bookshelf and then spoke.
0:33:5|0:33:11|[Di Renjie] spoke sincerely, then placed the scroll in front of him with both hands, gazing at it for a long time before continuing.
0:33:12|0:33:18|[Di Renjie] said this, causing the two of them to be deeply moved, and they remained silent for a while.
0:33:18|0:33:24|[Yuchi Zhenjin] raised the scroll with both hands and said.
0:33:27|0:33:37|The two met in a case to investigate the Dragon King in the capital, at that time the Minister of Justice was [Yuchi Zhenjin], and now he is the commander of the Imperial Guards.
0:33:37|0:33:45|Now everything has changed, with a sigh, [Yuchi Zhenjin] seemed to have endless words stuck in his throat, several times wanting to reveal the Empress's plan completely.
0:33:45|0:33:52|In the end, with some reservations, he turned and left. Outside the Dali Temple, [Shatuo Zhong] also had thoughts in his heart.
0:34:19|0:34:26|Just as he was lost in his worries, the words of a nearby vendor caught his attention.
0:34:51|0:35:4|Upon hearing this, [Shatuo Zhong] immediately became alert. Concerned about the Empress, he entered the market and sat down at a vendor's stall, secretly observing [Shui Yue] hiding in the corner tower responsible for monitoring the Grand Court.
0:35:5|0:35:22|Her gaze fell upon the fluttering flag, the patterns on it were the same as the faintly visible runes on the ground when she first arrived at the Dali Temple. Where the flag stood was a group of sorcerers gathering to perform tricks, different from other sorcerers in the market, all of them concealed their true faces with ghost masks.
0:35:22|0:35:49|Shui Yue carefully observed, only to see Shatuo Zhong dressed in official attire sitting among them, staring at the eerie spells and incantations silently in his heart. At this moment, a strange figure with a hawk mask was secretly peering. The strange guests here exchanged glances, and the female performer in the field immediately danced, spinning around with bells and ropes all over her body, with a bewitching melody piercing the ears. In just a moment, Shatuo Zhong was already confused. Seeing this, the female performer accompanied him closely, embracing him with a smile as gentle as peach blossoms.
0:35:50|0:36:0|With every move exuding charm and allure, just at this critical moment, a person suddenly rushed out and stood in front of [Shatuo Zhong], without saying a word, and slapped him directly across the face.
0:36:0|0:36:10|The pain subsided, the illusion was lifted, and then he explained that, after which he dragged the somewhat dazed [Shatuo Zhong] towards the market outside.
0:36:27|0:36:34|Seeing the two about to leave, [Shui Yue] quickly jumped down from the corner tower and rushed towards the disguised [Di Renjie].
0:36:42|0:36:54|Passing by [Shatuo Zhong], [Di Renjie] turned and blended into the crowd in the market. [Shui Yue] arrived a step late and mistakenly took an old man for [Di Renjie]. After investigating and finding nothing, she left in frustration. She spoke fluent Fan language and turned out to be a Tiele tribe member.
0:36:56|0:37:1|Looking around the market, only seeing pedestrians coming and going, it was difficult to find any trace of [Di Renjie].
0:37:1|0:37:15|At this moment, [Shui Yue] suddenly felt several masked individuals lurking beside her, their intentions unknown. Not knowing their origins or identities, she did not engage with them, but instead quickly withdrew and left. She then lifted the corner of the door curtain and rushed in.
0:37:15|0:37:25|The masked men followed closely behind, but [Shui Yue] was nowhere to be seen. They then arrived at a hidden tent, surrounded by eerie charms and spells hanging in the air. Inside the tent, a strange figure stood tall with a brazier placed in the center.
0:37:54|0:38:0|Di Renjie was hanging high above the dangerous building. By the next day, the empress's carriage had arrived outside the Dali Temple.
0:38:1|0:38:15|Upon the arrival of the Empress, the guard hurriedly reported the disturbance outside. Upon hearing this, the Empress warned [Shatuo Zhong] to be on guard.
0:38:23|0:38:36|In the temple, after the police officers lined up to welcome them respectfully, [Shatuo Zhong] hurriedly acted according to the plan. He searched through the medicine box for the note left by [Di Renjie], and only then did he realize where he was hiding.
0:38:36|0:38:53|The empress is powerful, and her entourage is no less grand than that of [Tang Gao Zong], with a canopy umbrella, eight banners, and attendants taking care of her every need. She is escorted by a team of imperial guards for protection. Upon arriving at the temple, the main seat is prepared for her, and the police officers finally stand up and line up to await further instructions.
0:38:53|0:39:0|The Empress Dowager expressed her intentions directly, saying,
0:39:37|0:39:47|Upon hearing these words, a fleeting smile crossed the Empress's face, then she returned to calmness. She saw the officers in the temple cowering under her authority, not daring to speak, so she pretended to be angry and spoke.
0:40:5|0:40:15|The words caused a stir, and the police officers in the temple looked at each other in confusion, not knowing what to do.
0:40:25|0:40:44|Although reluctant to make things difficult, the will of the Empress can't be disobeyed. She had to lead everyone to inspect the temple thoroughly. As the people dispersed from the scene, [Shui Yue] kept a close eye on [Shatuo Zhong] who hurriedly left. She saw him running all the way, encountering a monk on the way and not even bothering to return the greeting. On the other side, the Empress led her people to inspect various places, and then [Ba Dao] bowed and said.
0:40:53|0:41:0|Upon hearing this, the Empress turned her head to [Huan Tian] and ordered him to speak.
0:41:16|0:41:33|Just as [Bo Qianzhang] was mocking [Huan Tian], [Shatuo Zhong] arrived at the entrance of the bathhouse. He hastily returned the gesture to the two attendants who bowed to him, then pushed aside the curtain and rushed into the bathhouse. Walking into a cubicle, he quickly loosened his clothes and hung them on a rack beside him, looking hurried and anxious.
0:41:33|0:41:40|Causing [Shui Yue] to be filled with suspicion, suddenly [Shatuo Zhong] crouched down in the compartment, [Shui Yue] lost sight and quickly looked elsewhere.
0:41:40|0:41:49|Glancing around, Di Renjie saw the tall corner tower beside him, offering a broad view. With a leap, he landed on top and sure enough, the entire scene inside the bathhouse was now in full view.
0:41:49|0:41:52|[Shui Yue] leaned on the railing and looked into the compartment.
0:41:52|0:42:3|A naked man stood up from hiding, with his back facing her. [Shui Yue] thought it was [Shatuo Zhong] still there, so she continued to watch. This man was none other than the capable detective Zhou Jin under [Di Renjie].
0:42:3|0:42:27|Taking advantage of Shui Yue's momentary distraction, the two of them swiftly changed positions and enacted a scene of deception, successfully disrupting her senses and escaping surveillance. Shatuo Zhong quickly put on some clothes and slipped out from a hidden compartment, cautiously ensuring that no one was following him. He made his way to the storage room, opened the door, and retrieved a note left by Di Renjie. By the candlelight, he carefully examined the note and compared the architectural structure with the items stored in the room.
0:42:27|0:42:35|He held up a note and kept muttering. After careful examination, he finally discovered a hidden door under the wooden ladder in the room.
0:42:35|0:42:52|Confirming that there was no one around, [Shatuo Zhong] pushed the door and entered the corridor. Walking to the end, he saw a secret room. Sitting on a cushion in front of the table was a person. Hearing a noise behind him, [Di Renjie] suddenly turned into blue smoke.
0:44:50|0:45:13|Di Renjie pushed Shatuo Zhong away and walked towards him. Meanwhile, Shui Yue, who was watching from the corner tower, finally realized that the person she was monitoring was not Shatuo Zhong. Without hesitation, she leaped down and rushed into the bathroom, only to come face to face with the naked Shatuo Zhong as he pushed open the compartment door.
0:45:27|0:45:36|Watching [Shui Yue] realizing her slip of the tongue, she didn't feel embarrassed at all. Bold and straightforward in her words and actions, she even made [Shatuo Zhong] blush.
0:46:9|0:46:18|The farce in the temple comes to an end, the scene shifts to the streets of Luoyang city during mealtime. [Yuchi Zhenjin] sits among the vendors, lost in thought.
0:46:37|0:46:52|[Yuchi Zhenjin] slammed the table fiercely. Then, amidst the surprised gazes of many Jinwu Guards, quickly left.
0:47:0|0:47:7|Yuchi Zhenjin had already arrived outside the Imperial Kitchen in the Temple of the Celestial King while speaking, muttering to himself.
0:47:15|0:47:30|After some deduction, he was convinced that the Dragon Spine bestowed by the emperor must be hidden by [Di Renjie] on the statue of the Heavenly King. Anxious and disregarding taboos, he leaped onto the statue, and as expected, the Dragon Spine was indeed concealed between the Heavenly King's chest armor and palm.
0:47:30|0:47:40|Yuchi Zhenjin carefully took it out and held it in front of him. The coldness of the iron spread through his mind, and he knew that the weapon in his hand was genuine.
0:48:0|0:48:10|At the moment when he was worried about how to proceed, suddenly the temple gate was broken, and a burly figure, carrying twin blades on his back, burst into the Temple of the Heavenly King. It was none other than the ghostly [Ba Dao].
0:48:26|0:48:46|They already had a mutual dislike for each other. Now, in this remote location, [Ba Dao] has come for the Kangling Dragon, and a life-and-death struggle ensues. With a big knife at his feet, he takes off the ice blade on his back and throws it at [Yuchi Zhenjin], only to see the ethereal single-edged knife change in mid-air, splitting into three parts - one real and two illusions, confusing the senses, as the big knife chops down.
0:48:46|0:48:52|The head of the celestial king, [Yuchi Zhenjin], dodged and pulled out his long sword from his waist, leaping down to engage in close combat.
0:48:52|0:49:3|After the confrontation, he was greatly surprised. This mysterious [Ba Dao] is not just a name, his skill with the double moon blades is superb, eerie and enchanting. His body is as solid as a rock, with boundless brute force, truly not easy to deal with.
0:49:3|0:49:8|In a moment of carelessness, [Ba Dao] lifted him up and slammed him heavily onto the beam.
0:49:8|0:49:20|Yuchi Zhenjin, feeling frustrated, once again leaped up to engage with [Ba Dao]. However, the weapon in Ba Dao's hand was both offensive and defensive, making it difficult to shake. In the blink of an eye, Yuchi Zhenjin was forced back into the temple corridor.
0:49:20|0:49:37|[Ba Dao] is as fierce as a tiger, chasing relentlessly. He steps on the Fan Yue double knives and uses his inner power to move forward, shattering the blue brick floor and sending stones flying. [Yuchi Zhenjin] retreats while spinning his Tang knife in front of him, purely on the defensive. However, as time passes, [Yuchi Zhenjin] has no choice but to retreat further and ends up leaping onto the second floor to temporarily evade.
0:49:37|0:49:44|[Ba Dao] swung his blade into the air, once again forcing him in front of the Heavenly King. Before he could stand firm, the dual blades flew in, exuding boundless killing intent.
0:49:46|0:49:50|[Yuchi Zhenjin] had to block with his sword, but was lifted by the monstrous force and slammed fiercely into the statue of the Heavenly King.
0:49:50|0:49:55|The second flying knife followed closely, and after dodging with all his might, [Yuchi Zhenjin] fell to the ground unable to move.
0:49:55|0:50:17|The crescent moon blade spun in the air, cutting through the two heavenly kings' statues from their calves, causing them to fall. [Yuchi Zhenjin] was trapped inside, temporarily unable to break free. Seeing this, [Ba Dao] angrily shouted and brought down the full force of his blade. [Yuchi Zhenjin] had no way to dodge, instinctively protecting his head and using the strength of his back to withstand the blow. With a loud bang, a corner of the dark moon blade unexpectedly broke off, leaving [Yuchi Zhenjin] unharmed.
0:50:17|0:50:21|Using the force of impact to break free.
0:50:21|0:50:29|This time, it should be Yuchi Zhenjin who has made great contributions in protecting the Kanglongjian on his back. At this moment, his eyes are shining, holding the Kanglongjian firmly, directly confronting the blade of Ba Dao.
0:50:29|0:50:36|As they leaped up, they accidentally triggered the mechanism on the mace, and the two clashed their weapons, the sound of the wind sword echoing like a dragon's roar and a phoenix's cry.
0:50:38|0:50:52|Watching the Ghostly Moon Fan and the Twin Blades of the Underworld being struck by the Dragon-Subduing Mace, in an instant, they cracked inch by inch. The shattered blade fragments flew like hidden arrows piercing through the body, splattering blood everywhere. [Ba Dao] was pierced from the chest to the back, turning into a lifeless body in just a few breaths, devoid of any vitality.
0:50:52|0:50:58|Yuchi Zhenjin averted a crisis by leaning against the statue of the Heavenly King, holding up the Dragon Spine Mace in front of him, and said,
0:51:0|0:51:7|With that, he couldn't help but show a delighted expression, bursting into laughter.
0:51:8|0:51:18|The next day, as the sun rose, Yuchi Zhenjin headed to the palace to report for duty. Halfway there, his heart was in turmoil. At this moment, with the Dragon Spine in hand, he couldn't help but recall what the Empress had said before.
0:51:38|0:52:3|Yuchi Zhenjin, who has been serving the Empress for a long time and knows her well, speculates that if Di Renjie loses the Konglong Rod this time, the Empress will definitely use it as a reason to request severe punishment from Tang Gao Zong. The idea of not harming Di Renjie and his family even a bit is hard to believe. With this in mind, Yuchi Zhenjin has no intention of handing over the Konglong Rod. He has already walked into the side hall, where a eunuch's voice prompts him to gather his thoughts again. Yuchi Zhenjin waits in the side hall.
0:53:15|0:53:24|Upon hearing the Empress's words, Yuchi Zhenjin knelt on the ground and was momentarily speechless, before replying. The scene then shifts to the Yiluan Hall.
0:53:47|0:53:58|[Tang Gao Zong] finished speaking and saw [Huan Tian] stand up, shaking off the dust to reveal four limbs, each arm holding firm, performing a powerful move in the air. Yuchi Zhenjin sneered, while the Empress Wu Zetian on the side laughed and clapped.
0:53:58|0:54:16|The courtiers all echoed one after another, but luckily [Tang Gao Zong] remained composed and was not very satisfied with this illusion. Looking at [Huan Tian], one hand holding floating dust in front of the chest, the other three arms pointing towards the sky, three dark clouds appeared out of nowhere at the fingertips. The dark clouds were controlled in the palm like shadows, then the four arms rotated, the dark clouds rose into the sky, floating above the grand hall with a momentum that covered the sky.
0:54:18|0:54:26|At this moment, [Gui Ye] spoke, and with a sudden shock, he flipped over, revealing the hidden mechanism within.
0:54:26|0:54:32|Several dozen pellets were shot into the dark clouds, causing thunder to roar.
0:54:38|0:55:5|The empress seemed to be convinced of something, paying no attention to what [Tang Gao Zong] said. She clapped her hands absentmindedly, while [Huan Tian] gently blew on the flute at his lips, the lingering sound like water wrapping around the dragon pillars in the hall, never-ending. Then, under the dark clouds, lightning and thunder struck, a sudden storm brewing. Some curious officials reached out to feel the rain, surprised.
0:55:24|0:55:32|Seeing this, [Huan Tian] made [Fei Yan] speak out to grab things from a distance.
0:55:57|0:56:14|After being appreciated by [Wu Zetian], Di Renjie and his team were unable to contain their excitement. Just then, dark clouds reappeared even more menacingly than before, with lightning striking into the swirling python in the clouds. From the palace to the court, neither the two saints nor the officials could make sense of it.
0:56:23|0:56:34|Just as [Gui Ye] was talking to [Huan Tian], dark clouds rolled over the palace, and the golden dragon on the pillar emitted a low roar, its eyes shining brightly, its armor glowing, coming to life.
0:56:36|0:57:0|The court officials in the palace exclaimed in surprise, the Jinwu Guards drew their swords and stood on guard. They saw the originally pure gold Nine-Clawed Celestial Dragon perched on the beams and pillars, twisting in mid-air. In the blink of an eye, it no longer had the stiffness of gold and stone, with eyes like bells, horns like dew-covered cattle, a mouth like a camel's head, fish scales and a snake body. It now loomed large in the palace, with hair moving on its own without wind, driving with few wings and soaring, its gaze like lightning, creating a great momentum to disturb people's minds, its voice like thunder.
0:57:0|0:57:7|With the commanding power and prestige, Di Renjie and his group saw the unusual scene before them, causing the others to panic and whisper as they crouched on the ground.
0:57:18|0:57:30|At this moment, a golden dragon in the clouds roared lowly, then stuck its head out and sneered at the people in the hall. Suddenly, a downpour drenched everything, but [Tang Gao Zong] remained dry. He forced himself to stand up and laughed heartily.
0:57:37|0:58:0|The courtiers clapped their hands in agreement, but there was still a hint of fear in their eyes. The golden dragon turned to face the group of strangers, its eyes sharp and proud. It then opened its huge mouth, and from under its tongue, flames spewed out, piercing through the court and reaching several yards outside the main hall, lasting for a long time without stopping. The golden dragon stood in the air, and where its gaze fell was exactly where [Gui Ye] was.
0:58:4|0:58:13|A burst of flames shot out from the dragon's mouth again, causing [Gui Ye] to scream in agony. Thick smoke billowed in the court, and officials, including the emperor and empress, all changed color.
0:58:15|0:58:36|[Yuchi Zhenjin] commanded the guards around him, paying no attention to anything else. After dealing with [Gui Ye], he then turned towards [Fei Yan]. Startled, [Fei Yan] mistakenly thought the golden dragon was attracted to the pearl in his hand. He shouted in panic, then threw the pearl aside, quickly got up, raised his sleeve robe in front of his eyes, and used magic to escape.
0:58:36|0:58:45|Who knew that the golden dragon's eyes were sharp, able to see through all illusions, and from the thick fog, it found the true form of [Fei Yan], swallowed it in one gulp, causing the maidservants to scream in shock.
0:58:45|0:58:56|[Yuchi Zhenjin] led the attendants to guard the two saints closely, while the golden dragon soared into the sky in the hall, standing upright for several meters, like a pillar reaching the heavens, shattering the dome and flying.
0:58:56|0:59:7|Sheng left, leaving a mess everywhere. Inside the hall, everyone was still in shock, [Yuchi Zhenjin] was the first to come to his senses, looking around only to see that [Huan Tian] was nowhere to be found, leaving behind only a pair of mechanical arms.
0:59:16|0:59:26|Yuchi Zhenjin finished speaking and dashed towards the palace gates. Having already arranged for guards, he led the troops into the palace, seeking reinforcements along the way.
0:59:28|0:59:45|[Yuchi Zhenjin] disregarded the palace rules, leaping and running on the roofs, heading straight to the noisy area. He stood in front of the assailant with his sword, only to see the person wearing a flowing meteor and qilin armor, with a double dragon turtle cloak on his back, looking exactly like himself, but with extremely eerie features.
0:59:45|0:59:52|[Yuchi Zhenjin] couldn't hide his shock, he was momentarily distracted by the person escaping over the wall, just as he was about to track him down,
1:0:2|1:0:8|Having no way to argue back, [Yuchi Zhenjin] could only throw down his weapon in anger.
1:0:31|1:0:39|[Tang Gao Zong] heard the thunderous rage and immediately sent someone to the Dali Temple.
1:1:37|1:1:43|Zhou Jin, Yi An, and another person rode their horses out of the Dali Temple, raising dust and galloping non-stop towards the city outskirts.
1:1:51|1:2:11|On the corner tower, [Shui Yue] spotted the masked sorcerer reappearing, closely following three railway police officers, and then rode a horse to chase after Zhou Jin and others. Zhou Jin became aware of it and split his forces into three routes, scattering to lure the enemy. The market outside the city was complex, with more than one force monitoring the Dali Temple. Amidst the chaos of arrows flying, Zhou Jin successfully manipulated both sides with just one step further.
1:2:11|1:2:17|[Di Renjie] is truly capable, worthy of the reputation of the Southeast's lost treasures and pearls in the sea.
1:2:34|1:2:50|When the three groups from the Dali Temple were each going their own way, [Shui Yue] chased the masked sorcerer into the streets. Turning a corner, [Shui Yue] abruptly stopped her horse, looking ahead to see the road shrouded in mist, as if deliberately obstructed by someone lurking in the shadows.
1:2:50|1:2:57|[Shui Yue] disdainfully rode forward on horseback, shouting loudly.
1:3:13|1:3:38|The two sides started fighting as soon as they exchanged words. [Shui Yue] rode towards three black-robed masked men. The three men pulled a steel wire from behind, connected to a hollow silver ball with eyeballs painted on it around their waists. Then there was a sound of breaking, enveloping the streets. The three black-clothed men leaped into the air on horseback, their limbs turning into long dry wood with sharp blades at the top, flying through the air towards [Shui Yue].
1:3:38|1:4:4|[Shui Yue] threw out flying knives to test, all of which were blocked by the three men with their weapons. In great surprise and fear, she saw the three men merge into one, wearing a black robe and transforming into a six-armed monster. [Shui Yue] released her cloak to obstruct their view, then rushed towards the monster, using a dagger to cut open its ghostly face. To her astonishment, the face that emerged from the darkness was that of the current empress, Wu Zetian. Momentarily distracted, she was stabbed in the side by the monster.
1:4:4|1:4:12|[Shui Yue] hurriedly evaded, relying on unparalleled light skills to contend with it, but suffered heavy injuries, and was ultimately forced by the monster onto the roof.
1:4:12|1:4:33|[Shui Yue] hurriedly dodged and was struck in the left shoulder again. She asked angrily, taking advantage of the monster's momentary relaxation of vigilance, [Shui Yue] used illusion techniques to escape from underneath it. With multiple wounds and blood gushing like a spring, during the ordeal, [Shui Yue] shattered debris fell from the roof, stirring up a cloud of dust.
1:4:39|1:5:9|Ignoring the eerie sounds of the monsters, [Shui Yue] put the whistle in her mouth and blew it. Nearby, her horse galloped towards her upon hearing the whistle. [Shui Yue] ran in a panic, but the monsters dispelled the illusion from the sky to the ground, revealing three black-robed figures who continued to chase her. Just as the three were about a yard away from [Shui Yue], a horse burst through the wall, blocking the black-robed figures and preventing them from advancing. This unexpected turn of events, with mysterious clouds and a thousand miles of protection, was the divine steed, seizing the opportunity while the three figures dodged and retreated.
1:5:9|1:5:16|[Shui Yue] once again jumped onto the roof and leaped into the water pool. Ignoring the pain from her wound, she quickly stood up and walked along the wall.
1:5:16|1:5:25|Blending into the crowd at the dye house, [Shui Yue] at this moment lacks her usual elegance. In the past, when she competed with [Yuchi Zhenjin] in the imperial city, even if she lost a move, she remained unruffled.
1:5:25|1:5:32|Now fighting against the black-robed figure, [Shui Yue] has fallen to this state, showing the terror of the masked sorcerer. She staggers to the side of a stable.
1:5:32|1:5:37|At this point, [Di Renjie] was already covered in blood, unable to move forward, lying limp on the ground, unable to move.
1:5:37|1:5:51|Next to [Shatuo Zhong], who had just changed his horse, [Shui Yue] looked slightly surprised at the scene. On the other side, as the black-robed figure regrouped and chased after them again, the dye house was bustling with activity, drawing the attention of passersby with the strange attire of the three individuals.
1:5:51|1:6:13|Three of them quietly cast illusions, and the passersby were drawn in. The ghostly faces of the three were like bottomless black holes, with dark light flowing. The illusion was complete in an instant. All the people present were under their control, gathering slowly and looking up at the sky. Following their gaze, they saw a flying celestial maiden dancing in the air, the sky clear and pure, the fairy graceful and scantily clad.
1:6:13|1:6:21|Baring her fragrant shoulders and revealing her creamy skin, dancing with the gentle breeze in a long silk dress, she seems to float as if detached from the world, her smile as delicate as the Milky Way.
1:6:21|1:6:28|The black-robed figure displayed illusion techniques, instantly causing dozens of people to fall into the same illusion, a formidable power.
1:6:28|1:6:32|After dealing with the obstructive passerby, the three of them split up to search for the whereabouts of [Shui Yue].
1:6:32|1:7:0|At the same time, [Shatuo Zhong], who has an inexplicable fondness for [Shui Yue], has dragged her into the stable, intending to hide her under the table. Unexpectedly, the confused [Shui Yue] kicked away the stool supporting the wooden board, causing boots, saddles, armor, and other items to collapse. [Shatuo Zhong] had to use his body as a support to prop it up, only to hear [Shui Yue] mumble in a daze,
1:7:8|1:7:28|The two of them realized they were from the same hometown only after speaking in Tiele language. As the black-clothed figure approached, [Shui Yue] called out to [Shatuo Zhong] to keep quiet. With no other choice, they had to remove the armor on their bodies to conceal their tracks. The nearby black-clothed figures moved away slightly. [Shatuo Zhong] was about to speak when [Shui Yue] stopped him with a soft warning to keep quiet. It was this extremely subtle sound that caught the attention of the black-clothed figures, who immediately turned their gaze towards the stables.
1:7:28|1:7:36|Fortunately, the person did not investigate further and left after a glance, under the heavy pressure, [Shatuo Zhong] could hardly hold on and hastily asked a question.
1:7:37|1:7:40|Shui Yue remained silent and swung the sword towards the neck.
1:7:40|1:7:45|[Shatuo Zhong] didn't wait for him to react, a gush of blood spurted from his mouth, and he fainted immediately.
1:7:45|1:7:57|The scene shifts to the sorcerer's place, where the black-robed figure reports to their clan leader about the disappearance of [Shui Yue]. Another clan member respectfully mentions that the Great Li Ministry has divided into three groups, most likely to seek reinforcements.
1:8:41|1:8:47|The Wind Demon tribe members, inspired by him, raised their arms and cheered.
1:8:47|1:9:12|In the midst of the passionate emotions in the tent, while inside the guest room, [Shui Yue], draped in a green veil, was awakening from a faint with sweat on her body. She saw [Shatuo Zhong] with a flushed face, making a move in front of her. Alert, she tightened her light veil and reached behind her, only to hear [Shatuo Zhong] speak.
1:9:38|1:9:51|Seeing the person in front of her pouting with a light and airy look, [Shui Yue] disregarded the intense pain in her body, dragging the dagger and swinging it towards [Shatuo Zhong]. At this moment, she was extremely weak, with most of her strength dissipated. [Shatuo Zhong] easily dodged and explained,
1:10:6|1:10:24|As soon as the words fell, there was a movement by the bed. Turning back, [Shui Yue] was seen lying on the ground unable to move.
1:10:33|1:10:47|[Shui Yue], who has been in the martial arts world for a long time, is very alert. [Shatuo Zhong] doesn't care and drinks a mouthful himself, then brings the pill to her lips. After a moment of hesitation, [Shui Yue] drinks a sip of the medicine juice, and her face immediately tightens with a drastic change in expression.
1:11:24|1:11:38|[Shui Yue] leaned against the bed and looked out the window, as if seeing wild chrysanthemums blooming on her homeland. The morning sun outlined the mountains and hills, with flocks of swallows flying by, prompting her to sigh suddenly.
1:11:39|1:11:47|[Shatuo Zhong] felt something in his heart, but found it hard to express. After a moment of silence, he finally spoke,
1:11:54|1:12:2|After calming his emotions, he refilled a bowl of herbal juice, held the hot bottom of the bowl with a handkerchief, and approached [Shui Yue] again, whispering gently.
1:12:10|1:12:17|In gentle words, [Shui Yue] listened quietly as [Shatuo Zhong] finished speaking, placed the freshly brewed medicine by the bed, tidied up, and hurriedly said.
1:12:20|1:12:34|Watching the man about to leave in front of her, [Shui Yue] suddenly felt a strong reluctance in her heart, with a hint of panic in her eyes. Finally, she spoke up and asked. [Shatuo Zhong], who had already left the guest room, poked his head out and told [Shui Yue].
1:12:35|1:12:53|When only [Shui Yue] was left in the room, she felt the pent-up anger in her chest for many years surging and boiling at this moment. The attentive care of [Shatuo Zhong] allowed her to let down her guard for the first time in her life. As those hardened defenses fell away, she realized that [Shui Yue] was nothing more than a lovely and charming young lady in her prime.
1:12:53|1:13:4|She drank the medicine in the bowl in one gulp, the salty bitterness penetrating her throat, going straight to her heart and lungs, mixing with the just budding sweetness, her facial expressions all turning into a bitter smile, hard to let go.
1:13:4|1:13:30|[Shatuo Zhong] rode his horse, smiling on the horseback, reminiscing the tender moments just now. He felt the smoothness of [Shui Yue]'s skin on his right hand, lingering from their intimate exchange in the guest room. [Shatuo Zhong] once asked [Shui Yue] why she concealed her face with heavy makeup, to which she sadly replied that she didn't want to reveal her true appearance. After hearing this, [Shatuo Zhong] took a handkerchief and gently wiped off the makeup on her forehead, filled with affection in [Shui Yue]'s eyes, without any resistance.
1:13:30|1:13:36|Deep in love, [Shatuo Zhong] spoke. [Shui Yue] then smiled.
1:13:54|1:14:2|The most tender part of [Shui Yue]'s heart, like soaking in sweet rain. The bitterness and hardships of wandering the rivers and lakes for more than ten years turned into tears that welled up in her eyes.
1:14:2|1:14:5|The taste of being understood and cared for is very good.
1:14:5|1:14:14|At the same time, outside the palace city, the disguised [Di Renjie] has already arrived, stopping three guards and demanding to see their identities.
1:14:24|1:14:31|Several people then arrived outside the Yiluan Hall, only to find it empty. The ground was covered with broken stones and tiles, and there were imperial guards stationed around the hall.
1:17:2|1:17:18|Huo Geng turned around in shock, then led the two to the Taiyu prison. Taiyu prison was a subordinate institution of the highest supervisory agency of the Tang Dynasty, the Imperial Censorate, responsible for detaining corrupt officials. Yuchi Zhenjin, who was being held in the prison, was equivalent to today's disciplinary inspection commission. As soon as they entered the prison, they heard Yuchi Zhenjin cursing loudly.
1:19:50|1:19:53|Huo Geng was stunned after hearing this, then turned to look at [Di Renjie].
1:19:53|1:19:56|Before he could say a word, [Yuchi Zhenjin] eyes widened in anger, pointing his finger and roaring loudly.
1:20:0|1:20:7|Huo Geng felt helpless and gave a deep look at his dismissed superior, beckoning and saying:
1:20:36|1:21:9|During the conversation, several people crouched down together to investigate the bottom of the carriage. [Di Renjie] tapped the carriage frame with a piece of soft wood in his hand, discerning the mystery by listening to the sound. [Ding Xun] took off his gloves from his waist and handed them over, being on guard. After that, they all leaned into the bottom of the carriage, removed the hidden objects, dragged them to a spacious area next to the carriage, and lit a lamp to observe. Only then did they realize that the object was a huge bundle of cloth.
1:21:9|1:21:22|[Di Renjie], with his hands wrapped in cloth, crouched down and opened the bundle on the ground, revealing a male corpse inside, with a withered appearance, tongue hanging out, and eyes closed. After the onlookers examined it, they exclaimed in shock and said,
1:21:54|1:22:4|[Ding Xun]'s words hit the nail on the head of this case. After a moment of thought, [Di Renjie] continued.
1:22:14|1:22:39|Upon hearing Yuchi Zhenjin's words, Di Renjie slightly turned his head to indicate the crowded surroundings. Yuchi Zhenjin waved his hand in understanding, causing Huo Geng to reluctantly shout for everyone to move away. After the people around had walked several yards away, Di Renjie called Yuchi Zhenjin to his side. The two stood facing each other, and Di Renjie lowered his voice to say slowly, pausing for a moment.
1:22:48|1:23:3|[Yuchi Zhenjin] suddenly realized and asked, hitting right at the heart of [Di Renjie]'s concerns, causing him to feel a sharp pain in his chest.
1:23:7|1:23:16|At the same time, Empress Wu Zetian, accompanied by her maid, marched aggressively towards the desolate mountain cave, breaking through the prison gate blocking the way, and roared angrily,
1:23:34|1:23:45|After that, the faceless monkey imprisoned in the underground water dungeon broke free from the shackles and rushed towards [Wu Zetian], grabbing her throat and shouting.
1:23:47|1:23:58|[Wu Zetian], in order to deceive others, entered and exited the death prison alone without any attendants, unexpectedly finding herself in a dangerous situation. Just then, a person outside the cave shouted.
1:24:49|1:24:57|Wu Zetian regained consciousness and saw Tang Gao Zong. Yuchi Zhenjin and Di Renjie were by his side.
1:25:18|1:25:33|On the other side, outside the Sanchang Temple, a man rode up on horseback, it was [Shatuo Zhong]. By now it was already night, the trees outside the temple were dense, with the sound of insects chirping, thin mist rising from the roots of the short trees, numerous strange rocks inside the temple, with only half a candle lit, the moonlight was clear, scattered all over the ground.
1:25:33|1:25:37|[Shatuo Zhong] entered, bowed to a monk in a cloth robe and spoke,
1:25:46|1:25:56|After that, [Di Renjie] pulled out the bamboo slip entrusted to him from his sleeve and handed it to the monk in front of him. After inspection, the monk said to him,
1:26:2|1:26:9|The monk stepped into the stone forest, ignoring the chatter behind him. [Shatuo Zhong] felt bored and had to hurry to catch up.
1:26:9|1:26:27|Approaching a giant banyan tree, the monk stopped in his tracks, gesturing to [Shatuo Zhong] before bowing and leaving. [Shatuo Zhong] choked back tears, watching as the monk walked away, his gaze drawn to the countless pillars built from stone blocks around him.
1:26:27|1:26:50|He took a piece to examine, but unexpectedly the entire stone pillar collapsed with a bang. [Shatuo Zhong] was greatly shocked and quickly looked around, only to see a figure hidden among the banyan trees. The person was sitting cross-legged in a tree hollow for who knows how long, with short grass growing on his knees, dried vines covering his body, and a dim cold light shining on him. The only thing shining brightly was the rosary on his chest.
1:26:50|1:27:0|It was the disciple of the Tripitaka master, [Yuan Ce]. [Shatuo Zhong] stepped forward to speak, but then remembered the paper with the symbol of the Wind Demon Clan entrusted to him by the monk in front of the temple, so he took it out from his bosom.
1:27:0|1:27:7|In front of [Yuan Ce], who had closed his eyes and remained motionless, [Shatuo Zhong] had to gently blow on his face in an attempt to awaken him.
1:27:7|1:27:15|At this moment, a loud roar was heard from above, and [Shatuo Zhong] looked up to see a giant ape descending from the sky, quickly dodging out of the way.
1:27:15|1:27:19|The giant ape stood between the banyan tree and [Shatuo Zhong], separating the two.
1:27:19|1:27:27|The massive figure, towering over [Shatuo Zhong], appeared like an ant from above. The giant ape, with its towering stature, raised a huge finger to press against [Shatuo Zhong]'s face.
1:27:27|1:27:34|Indicating to speak less, [Shatuo Zhong] understood, quickly raising the talisman in his hand. The giant ape glanced sideways to observe, then looked at [Shatuo Zhong].
1:27:34|1:27:50|Xiaozhi understood the intention, the giant ape exhaled hot air from its nose, then entered the temple. The space twisted, and in an instant, fireflies fluttered, immortal mist lingered, and all the plants and trees were radiant with spiritual energy. At this moment, the giant ape disappeared, and a voice came faintly.
1:28:5|1:28:11|At the sound of the call, a huge koi fish emerged from the vegetation, hovering in the air and circling around [Shatuo Zhong].
1:28:11|1:28:18|The trees in the sky, the mountains in the clouds, the universe reverses with it,
1:29:10|1:29:23|The Golden Carp transformed into [Yuan Ce], and after speaking, swished its tail and disappeared into the thick fog. When [Shatuo Zhong] came to his senses, he found himself on the back of a giant ape, climbing through the treetops. The giant ape carried him to [Yuan Ce]'s secluded place of cultivation, outside the Sanzang Temple.
1:29:23|1:29:30|[Shatuo Zhong] fell to the ground, unharmed. The experience left him dizzy and incredulous.
1:29:30|1:29:39|When Shatuo Zhong stood up, the giant ape threw another brocade pouch and then shook its huge head before flying away, leaving Shatuo Zhong standing there in confusion.
1:29:39|1:29:56|Early the next morning in the outskirts of Luoyang City, a simple carriage entered through the main gate of the Dali Temple without any hindrance. The person driving the carriage was none other than [Di Renjie]. The assistant minister [Bao Qianzhang] came to greet him with a group of people, and as soon as the patrol officer opened his mouth to ask a question.
1:30:8|1:30:22|After saying that, [Bo Qianzhang] led the men and women in the carriage to walk deep into the Dali Temple. From the caution of [Di Renjie] to the respect of [Bo Qianzhang], it is expected that these two individuals should be the two saints of the current dynasty, [Tang Gao Zong] and [Wu Zetian].
1:30:32|1:30:38|[Di Renjie] hurriedly stopped him, whispered a warning, and then asked.
1:30:55|1:31:11|At this moment, [Shatuo Zhong] noticed the needle holes on his fingers and asked. Then the scene shifted to [Di Renjie]'s bedroom, where [Shatuo Zhong] continued to perform acupuncture to stabilize his condition.
1:31:33|1:31:59|The conversation once again stirred up the heartache of [Di Renjie], the words of Master Sanzang and [Yuan Ce] from years ago lingered in his mind. [Di Renjie] kept repeating [Yuan Ce]'s words, suddenly placing his right palm on the candle flame to train, enduring the intense pain to sharpen his mind, contemplating [Yuan Ce]'s words. [Shatuo Zhong] was greatly surprised, not daring to interrupt, fearing to disrupt his thoughts and undo all the previous efforts. When he had some insights, [Di Renjie] was physically and mentally exhausted, fainting away.
1:32:12|1:32:18|They quickly assembled to execute the backup plan, with another group of people bowing and stepping aside.
1:33:1|1:33:10|At this point, [Gui Ye] and the clan leader chuckled, and after much consideration, the clan leader spoke, instructing [Gui Ye] to sneak into the Dali Temple at night to investigate the whereabouts of the Empress.
1:33:25|1:33:41|With his words, a clan member presented a tray with a black cloth on it in front of the clan leader. After lifting the cloth, a magical weapon was revealed, and the clan leader spoke with a sharp weapon in hand. The scene then shifted to Di Renjie waking up.
1:33:46|1:33:54|Ignoring what [Shatuo Zhong] said, [Di Renjie] struggled to sit up, leaning against the bed railing, panting for a while before speaking seriously,
1:34:55|1:35:5|[Di Renjie] paused his actions and looked at [Shatuo Zhong] with a hint of confusion. [Shatuo Zhong] smiled ambiguously, his gaze evasive, before finally nodding.
1:35:5|1:35:13|[Di Renjie] frowned with concern, and the scene shifted to the temporary residence of [Shui Yue] in the pharmacy.
1:35:34|1:35:41|Shatuo Zhong dared not act rashly, closed his eyes and waited. Shui Yue said he was ignorant, so she used her hands to open his eyes.
1:35:48|1:36:1|Following the sound of the conversation, [Shui Yue] saw Yi An and Zhou Jin leading three people into the pharmacy for inspection. Puzzled, she stood in front of [Shatuo Zhong] with a hint of dissatisfaction and asked.
1:36:3|1:36:12|Upon hearing this, [Shui Yue]'s face froze, as if a mist was condensing in her eyes. Yuchi Zhenjin and the others shook their heads to indicate that they had not found anything.
1:36:12|1:36:18|The police officers stepped forward and tied [Shui Yue]'s hands with a rope, intending to take her away for questioning.
1:36:41|1:36:44|The two looked at each other for a long time, and then the police escorted [Shui Yue] out of the house.
1:37:4|1:37:22|After speaking, [Di Renjie] led all the monks to bow and ask for advice. [Shui Yue], who had long lived in the martial arts world, only knew that people's hearts were not ancient, full of deceit. She had never received such trust before. Moreover, she had just thought that she and [Shatuo Zhong] had a falling out, but now the situation had changed. [Shui Yue] couldn't help but feel agitated and unable to calm down.
1:37:22|1:37:38|Turning his gaze to [Shatuo Zhong], he saw tears staining his clothes, confirming that what [Di Renjie] said was true. With [Shui Yue]'s strong-willed character, she charged forward and directly knocked [Shatuo Zhong] to the ground, straddling him and punching and kicking him.
1:37:39|1:37:49|The incident came to an end, and the scene shifted to the back door of the Dali Temple. [Shatuo Zhong] rode out with a battered head, while [Shui Yue] used illusion magic to conceal herself behind him.
1:37:49|1:38:1|Walking through the market, [Shatuo Zhong] paused at a bustling place for a moment, while [Shui Yue] immediately dispelled the illusion and crossed over the wall to leave. [Shatuo Zhong] stopped his horse abruptly and looked into the distance, silently reciting to himself.
1:38:21|1:38:53|Shatuo Zhong couldn't help but ask Di Renjie, sensing that war was imminent. Di Renjie reviewed the temple guards, deployed defensive formations. After all the arrangements were made, it was already late at night. At this moment, in the bedroom, holding up the Kanglei Staff carefully, recalling Yuchi Zhenjin holding the Kanglei Staff in one hand, horizontally in front of his eyes, and rotating the staff to generate force, striking a stone pillar behind him. The stone pillar cracked inch by inch.
1:38:53|1:39:1|Transformed into a lump of bran, [Di Renjie] pondered on this, frowning deeply. The gift bestowed by [Tang Gao Zong] could not be dealt with using common sense.
1:39:1|1:39:7|The true purpose of the Dragon Spine Staff is yet to be discovered, and the weight of responsibility entrusted by [Tang Gao Zong] is immense.
1:39:7|1:39:28|At this moment, footsteps were heard outside the door. [Di Renjie] turned around and saw a person speaking. The person was dressed in light silk and heavy makeup, and was accompanied by a pair of prison guards. Surprisingly, it was the reigning Empress.
1:40:22|1:40:32|The empress turned over on the bed of [Di Renjie].
1:40:51|1:41:0|The moment these words were spoken, the Empress's gaze fell upon the Dragon Spine, unable to look away.
1:41:20|1:41:44|After finishing speaking, [Di Renjie] wielded his sword and struck the Empress's arm. Suddenly, the Empress had a Bilian iron snow blade in her hand, waving it continuously towards him. [Di Renjie] dodged and then used his staff to strike the snow blade. With a loud sound, the illusion shattered, and the Empress transformed into a sinister and eerie figure, laughing coldly. In her hand was the Bilian iron snow blade that could shatter gold and stone.
1:41:44|1:41:53|The Dragon Spine has been broken by a strike.
1:42:10|1:42:19|After [Gui Ye] finished speaking, a raging fire ignited on his body as he shouted that he would destroy the Tang Dynasty, breaking through the door. Fortunately, [Di Renjie] pushed aside the night patrol guards, and everyone was unharmed. However, the dormitory they were in was engulfed in flames from [Gui Ye].
1:42:19|1:42:26|Xianglian, thick smoke billowed instantly, the fire was raging. Taking advantage of the chaos, [Gui Ye] transformed into a fireball and flew away.
1:42:43|1:42:52|The scene shifts to outside the Sanzang Temple, where the stone forest is in ruins, as if it has been affected by the flames of war.
1:43:12|1:43:21|At this highly tense moment, a cough was heard from behind. [Shui Yue] wielded two curved knives and stood ready, the scene faded away with the outcome unknown. The next morning,
1:43:43|1:44:5|On this day, the outskirts of the city were shrouded in thick fog, making it impossible to see beyond ten steps, with the officials in the Grand Court holding crossbows and wearing long knives, stationed throughout the mansion, ready for battle. Outside the Grand Court, [Huo Geng] was ordered to lead countless palace guards, secretly lurking, waiting quietly for the enemy to attack. At this moment, a strange low growl was heard from the Qiantang River, and the guards on the Sword Tower were on high alert.
1:44:6|1:44:40|In the hidden carriage in Qiantang, a police officer entered the square, looked up, and saw a hundred-foot tall angry statue, as if cast from crystal stone, with countless bloodshot eyes growing all over its body, terrifying. The statue grabbed a police officer as others followed to the mechanism inside the temple, breaking it with force. Suddenly, a large net hidden inside dropped down, firmly locking the arm with blood-red pupils. The statue fell for the trap, showing its iron face and sharp teeth.
1:44:40|1:44:46|The person locked in his gaze, everyone felt a chill down their spine, as if those bloodshot eyes had a strange effect on the mind.
1:44:46|1:44:49|[Di Renjie] arrived upon hearing the news and spoke.
1:45:1|1:45:18|Taking the hand-copied scripture given by the police officer beside him, feeling grateful, reciting the scriptures together, the mind calm and composed, as if a heavenly net was enveloping the demonic forces, with a little effort, they turned into ashes and disappeared without a trace.
1:45:27|1:45:40|Just as the crowd was rescuing their companion in the square, they heard a scream from the archer lying in ambush on the roof, falling down the building. Then they saw numerous black-robed figures, wearing ghost masks, holding curved knives in their right hands, and flying towards them with small diamond shields in their left hands.
1:45:46|1:46:16|Inside the temple, the guards were on high alert. Suddenly, a figure in black robes flew over the main gate with a long pole, leaping onto the high walls and engaging in a fierce battle with the guards inside. The sheer number of attackers caught the wall defenders off guard. The first line of defense was breached, and the black-robed figures, with their unpredictable movements, swiftly cleared out the archers positioned on the rooftops, leaving them either dead on the tiles or falling into the courtyard below. The Wind Demon clan had surrounded the Great Liang Temple from all sides, moving with the speed of the wind, forcing the people inside to retreat. However, the battle had only just begun.
1:46:16|1:46:24|A large number of enemies surged in from all sides. In the midst of close combat, many of the mounted police were killed or injured, revealing the terror of the Wind Demon tribe.
1:46:32|1:46:56|[Di Renjie] gave the order, and the police officer in the watchtower tried to ring the bronze bell, but was stopped by a figure in black. [Shatuo Zhong] protected his companion to retreat to the main hall, while he rushed towards the watchtower. Inside the arrow tower, [Ding Xun] hurriedly faced the enemy, shouting to [Di Renjie] below. Then he threw a hemp rope down, and [Di Renjie] understood, climbing up the rope with a slight run-up, gently swinging up the beam.
1:46:56|1:47:0|With the help of this force, [Yuchi Zhenjin] hung on the eaves of the side hall and flipped onto the roof.
1:47:0|1:47:9|At the same time, [Shatuo Zhong] rushed to the base of the corner tower's bronze bell, ready to strike it. However, a figure in black robes suddenly appeared with a drawn sword, catching [Shatuo Zhong] off guard, leaving him stunned in place.
1:47:12|1:47:36|Fortunately, [Di Renjie] arrived just in time and swiftly dealt with the enemies with a hand crossbow. Outside the temple, [Huo Geng] heard the bell and shouted. Immediately, numerous Jinwu guards hidden in the market brandished their weapons and rode their horses towards the main gate of the Dali Temple. A small number of soldiers stayed behind to watch over the common people and merchants. On the other side, the leader of the Fengmo tribe finally appeared, standing on the rooftop with [Gui Ye] and the cloaked figures by his side.
1:47:36|1:47:44|Outside the temple, the Jinwu guards are approaching. The leader of the Fengmo tribe shakes the magic wheel in his hand, causing the silver hollow ball hanging around the waist of the tribe members to move.
1:47:44|1:47:53|The demonic sound filled the air in all directions, and everyone present was unknowingly trapped in an illusion. Just then, a commotion was heard coming from outside the main gate.
1:47:53|1:48:3|The temple guard quickly turned his crossbow towards the front, as under the illusion, the arriving Jinwuwei transformed into a huge monster, shining with blood all over, headless and bodyless, forming a ball of flesh.
1:48:8|1:48:22|Seeing those tentacles rushing towards them, everyone panicked. The Heart Spell was ineffective, so they had no choice but to shoot a barrage of arrows at the monster. Little did they know, in the eyes of the Golden Guards, it was also an illusion at this moment. The arrows flying in the air turned into tentacles and headed straight for everyone's faces.
1:48:24|1:48:33|[Huo Geng], fearless of death, led his men to dodge the flying arrows in the air, galloping wildly on horseback. In a moment, he clashed with the temple guards inside, and in the illusion, limbs were severed in the fierce battle.
1:48:33|1:48:41|[Di Renjie] and [Shatuo Zhong] rushed to Qiantang and saw the chaos in the scene, so they anxiously spoke out.
1:48:53|1:49:0|[Di Renjie] lightly tapped the ground, standing between the Chengjing and Jinwuwei, raised the Konglong Rod high, rotated the mechanism, and shouted loudly.
1:49:1|1:49:16|Suddenly, the tentacles that were swirling like a group of demons dissipated with the wind, and both sides quickly regained their senses. [Huo Geng] quickly reacted in confusion and ordered the people behind him.
1:49:24|1:49:50|[Di Renjie] looked towards the backyard and saw thick smoke billowing from the warehouse. Just as he ordered [Yuan Ce] to rush back for support, the Wind Demon chieftain and [Gui Ye] sensed something was amiss. While [Yuan Ce] led two constables about to rush into the warehouse to rescue, [Gui Ye] intercepted them on the way, wielding a cane to force the three back with just one strike, and rushed into the hiding place of the two saints ahead of them.
1:49:50|1:49:59|The police officer was overwhelmed by the thick smoke and fell to the ground. [Gui Ye] carefully traced the source of the smoke and soon discovered a hidden room. With a sinister smile, he then rushed forward, broke down the door and entered.
1:50:1|1:50:18|The thick smoke here obscures the sight of the fire. [Gui Ye] is an expert in playing with fire. If it were an ordinary day, he would have been aware of it. However, now presented with the opportunity to hunt down and exterminate the great Tang Dynasty, [Gui Ye] falls into the trap without suspecting anything. He doesn't see the emperor and empress, but hears [Yuchi Zhenjin] shouting loudly.
1:50:31|1:50:37|It turned out to be a trick by [Di Renjie] to create suspicion among the soldiers. That day, two people were in the carriage.
1:50:37|1:50:46|It was Yuchi Zhenjin and the police officer Zhou Jin. Knowing that they had fallen into a trap, they saw Yuchi Zhenjin turn into blue smoke and disappear without a trace. Gui Ye sneered and then swiftly fled towards the door.
1:50:48|1:51:0|As the mechanism near the corridor suddenly activates, two sharp blades block the way, and a row of wooden stakes knocks them away. [Gui Ye] falls into the fighting room, surrounded by [Yuchi Zhenjin] and Zhou Jin, and then screams in terror as flames engulf his body.
1:51:0|1:51:7|The other two covered their eyes with a headscarf above their foreheads to guard against his illusions. The fierce battle between trapped beasts began immediately.
1:51:50|1:51:58|Upon finishing speaking, the Wind Demon clan leader soared through the air effortlessly, walking on the ground as if it were flat, and walked straight from the roof to the ground.
1:52:10|1:52:29|The leader of the Wind Demon clan, bearing deep hatred, seeks revenge, [Di Renjie]'s words are in vain, and the two sides fight again in the temple. The black-robed figure, already occupying the high ground, rushes out under a barrage of arrows, throwing dozens of spherical hidden weapons into the crowd, filled with thick smoke, instantly shrouding the entire battlefield.
1:52:30|1:52:40|[Di Renjie] covered his nose and mouth, hurriedly called for everyone to scatter and take cover, while on the other side, inside the warehouse, [Gui Ye] used illusions to create endless flames, unaware that this place had already been prepared.
1:52:40|1:52:50|The entire storage room floor was covered with yellow phosphorus and other materials. Once touched, it ignited immediately, and the room was filled with flames. [Gui Ye] was helpless, fleeing in panic as he shouted in fear.
1:52:50|1:53:0|Zhou Jin used his hearing to determine the location, pressed the mechanism with the long knife in his hand, and saw four iron bars rising from the ground towards the railing, forming a prison cell, where [Gui Ye] was imprisoned and unable to escape.
1:53:1|1:53:8|[Yuchi Zhenjin] flashed to the beam and said, while [Gui Ye] in the prison wailed in agony, and ultimately self-immolated to death.
1:53:8|1:53:26|On the other side of the square, the crowd was engaged in a fierce battle. Despite Di Renjie's strong martial arts skills, he was overwhelmed by multiple opponents. A black-clothed figure hooked his ankle with a rope, causing him to fall to the ground. Shatuo exclaimed in shock, covered his mouth and nose, and hurried to provide support.
1:53:26|1:53:40|Surrounded by black-robed figures, three ropes were thrown out to tightly bind [Di Renjie]'s limbs, suspending him in the air. His Kanglong mace had already fallen to the ground. With limited skills, [Shatuo] could only pick up the mace and flee in the chaos of the battle.
1:53:41|1:53:50|Yi An and other police officers saw [Di Renjie] being subdued. In a moment of urgency, they bravely fought the enemy, causing the situation to become even more chaotic. The leader of the Wind Demon Clan feared a mutation and once again activated the magic wheel to perform illusion techniques.
1:53:50|1:54:4|At this moment of chaos, fear gripped the hearts of everyone. The furious Demon Wheel transformed into the wrathful Vajra, his hair standing on end as he soared into the sky, his bloodshot eyes piercing through the souls of men. His towering figure spanned heaven and earth, and with a long roar, echoed through the ages.
1:54:5|1:54:17|In addition, even the black-robed figure transformed into a monster, donning spiritual armor and sprouting wings on its back, resembling a furious dragon. It opened its bloodthirsty mouth and swooped down towards the crowd, plunging them into another fierce battle.
1:54:17|1:54:37|Fortunately, just after [Yuchi Zhenjin] dealt with [Gui Ye], he arrived in time and saw [Di Renjie] being held by the furious Vajra. He leaped into the air and threw three flying knives, cutting the rope controlling the monster and saving [Di Renjie]. This move undoubtedly attracted the attention of the foreign races on the field. As a result, a nearby evil dragon bared its fangs and claws and lunged towards [Yuchi Zhenjin].
1:54:37|1:54:48|Ignoring the need to support [Di Renjie], [Yuchi Zhenjin] had to entangle with the evil dragon on the roof. At this moment, the rest of the people were also under the crazy counterattack of the foreign tribes, and there were often police officers falling to the ground with serious injuries.
1:54:48|1:54:55|The Great Li Palace is stained with blood, and [Ding Xun] tried to hold the high ground but failed at this moment, showing the fierceness of the attack.
1:54:56|1:55:12|Seeing [Ding Xun] falling from the arrow tower and being entangled by a fierce dragon, [Di Renjie] hurried to the rescue. He threw his small shield to drive away the dragon. Meanwhile, [Shatuo] was already in a difficult situation, struggling to protect his Kanglong Spear. Seizing the opportunity, he rushed towards [Yuchi Zhenjin] and shouted loudly.
1:55:15|1:55:26|Immediately, the Dragon Spine was thrown out. [Yuchi Zhenjin] on the roof had just finished dealing with the entangled evil dragon and had not reacted yet. He saw the Dragon Spine flying towards him, so he hurried to intercept it, but unfortunately, he was one step too late.
1:55:26|1:55:52|Two evil dragons intercepted, soaring to snatch the Konglong Rod and throwing it to [Chief of the Wind Demon Clan], standing on the eaves. The Chief of the Wind Demon Clan raised his arms and shouted that the Great Tang would be destroyed. The crowd of his clan followed suit, creating a tumultuous noise. In contrast, [Di Renjie] and his companions looked ashen-faced. [Shatuo], seeing this, forgot to resist and was attacked by the evil dragons. At that moment, they heard someone behind them cursing in a harsh tone.
1:55:53|1:56:0|The person dual-wielding short knives with swift and fierce movements, striking deadly blows from both sides, is none other than [Shui Yue].
1:56:6|1:56:20|[Shui Yue] returned just as [Yuan Ce] emerged from seclusion. Sure enough, as soon as the two started talking, a giant ape charged towards them, swooping down from above the head of [Feng Mo Clan Leader], snatching the Kang Long Mace from his hand in the process. The one controlling the giant ape and perching on the opposite rooftop was none other than [Yuan Ce].
1:56:21|1:56:27|After that, [Feng Mo Clan Leader] waved the magic wheel in his hand and took the initiative to attack.
1:56:27|1:56:39|The furious Di Renjie was surrounded by billowing blood and accompanied by countless evil dragons. The scene was awe-inspiring as he gestured and commanded the evil dragons to attack the giant ape. Yuchi Zhenjin clenched his fist and wielded the Konglong Flail.
1:56:39|1:56:47|With the long halberd placed in front of his chest, [Di Renjie] signaled the giant ape to stand up straight, swinging his arms. The airborne evil dragon could not be easily subdued, only able to dance around its perimeter, making it difficult to approach.
1:56:47|1:57:11|Looking at the giant ape, with feet as swift as the wind, tearing through thunder, advancing and retreating like a raging wind sweeping through, opening and closing grandly, as if a divine thunder descended from the sky. With little effort, it completely crushed the group of evil dragons. Then, standing on the eaves, it roared defiantly at the Wind Demon Chief, causing everyone on the scene to marvel. Under [Yuan Ce]'s command, the mighty ape displayed unparalleled power. Victory seemed certain in this battle, as the furious gorilla advanced towards the giant ape.
1:57:11|1:57:33|With worries in their hearts, they each sought a safe corner and looked up at the battlefield. [Yuchi Zhenjin] and [Di Renjie] approached the arrow tower to observe. The heavily injured [Shatuo Zhong] called for [Shui Yue] to support him as they leaned against a pillar and looked at each other. Then they saw a furious figure with a body hundreds of feet tall, causing the ground to shake as he walked. Muscles crisscrossed his body, bloodshot eyes, and a rosary hanging around his neck, connected by numerous skulls.
1:57:33|1:57:41|With two dragon heads as decoration, eyes wide open in anger, a silk ribbon dancing under the armpit, the momentum is immense, reaching the heavens and the earth, a giant ape in front of it, no bigger than an ant.
1:57:41|1:58:5|Once again, it opened its bloody mouth and spat out three spherical tentacles. [Yuan Ce] remained unchanged, allowing the tentacles to entwine around him, and together with the giant, they were swallowed into the fleshy ball. The onlookers in the temple were terrified, their faces changing color in an instant. Fortunately, after a moment of hesitation, the tentacles naturally separated, releasing [Yuan Ce]. With a single arm pushed forward, the three tentacles obeyed his command, darting out and pinning themselves above the furious eyes, nose, and mouth of the Vajra.
1:58:5|1:58:16|King Kong roared in pain, his eyeballs bursting out of his body and staring fiercely at [Yuan Ce]. Then, the more than a hundred eyeballs rushed towards the giant ape and solidly smashed into him, as if they had a life of their own.
1:58:16|1:58:23|The eyeballs surrounded the giant ape from all directions, once hit, they turned into a muddy and sticky pool of blood, sticking to the giant ape making it difficult to move.
1:58:23|1:58:51|In the blink of an eye, [Yuan Ce] and the giant ape were wrapped into a slightly squirming mass of rotten flesh. The furious Golden Gorilla took a step forward, swung its arms, and punched directly at the mass of flesh, splattering blood everywhere. However, there was no trace of [Yuan Ce] in it. A roar came from the top of the gorilla's head, the mighty Mangshan Giant Ape. With this roar, the furious Golden Gorilla's body burst inch by inch, blood splattering everywhere but leaving no trace on the ground. Under the seat of Master [Yuan Ce], the guardian beast,
1:58:51|1:59:1|Possessing the divine power to break illusions, known for cutting off worldly desires and upholding the law, [Huan Tian] remains aloof from the world. Locking the heart's monkey to return to tranquility, do not let the mind's horse roam freely.
1:59:1|1:59:14|This ape, embodying the practice of the horse, [Yuan Ce] has reached the realm of transformation. The illusion technique of the Wind Demon Clan is difficult to harm him in the slightest. Now that the illusion has been broken, the Wind Demon Clan leader is seriously injured, falling from the sky in a sorry state.
1:59:14|1:59:23|The mask fell off, revealing his true face, which showed the scars from the execution years ago, terrifying and shocking. Meanwhile, [Yuan Ce] dispatched a giant ape to guard the rooftop.
1:59:24|1:59:36|Entering the room gracefully, like a gentle breeze without stirring up any dust, with hands clasped in front of the chest, the monk's robe fluttering. From afar, it seemed as if a Buddha's light was shining, but upon closer inspection, it appeared quite ordinary. Only to hear him speak slowly.
1:59:47|1:59:57|Hearing what [Yuan Ce] said, the leader of the Wind Demon clan once again recalled the suffering he had endured in the past, the cries of his people echoing in his ears, causing intense pain in his heart. Decades of careful planning were now destroyed in an instant.
1:59:57|2:0:5|At this moment, his mind was in turmoil, filled with boundless hatred. He roared in anger and charged towards [Yuan Ce] with a magic wheel in hand. [Yuan Ce] remained calm and composed, with a dignified appearance.
2:0:5|2:0:19|Extending his palm, [Di Renjie] used one finger to immobilize the leader of the Wind Demon Clan from a distance, then dragged him closer. With a horizontal palm push forward, the leader was seen flying out and falling to the ground. Monks, sweeping the floor, fear injuring ants' lives, cherishing the silk that covers the lamp for the moth.
2:0:19|2:0:34|Even when facing the most evil person, two iron pear blossoms flew out of the magic wheel and tightly wrapped around [Yuan Ce]'s head.
2:1:12|2:1:29|When about to take action, the leader of the Wind Demon clan was also entangled by the magic wheel on his head. It seemed that it was [Yuan Ce] who cast the illusion. The iron pear blossom made by Vajra locked the enemy's head firmly and was unbreakable. The leader of the Wind Demon clan was attacked by [Yuan Ce] with the same illusion technique, falling deep into hell, feeling all kinds of pain.
2:1:50|2:2:7|At this moment, compared to the calm [Yuan Ce], the leader of the Wind Demon clan was in agony, kneeling on the ground tightly clenching his fists. It seemed that within the demon wheel there was a fear that he could not resist. Finally, after being calmly explained by [Yuan Ce], the leader of the Wind Demon clan let go of his resentment and killing intent. The demon wheel above his head slowly unfolded and disappeared.
2:2:7|2:2:16|On the other side, [Yuan Ce] turned the Dragon Scepter to amplify the power, the magic wheel shattered for a moment, and the treasure appeared as new. Then he looked towards the leader of the Wind Demon Clan and spoke.
2:2:26|2:2:41|Experiencing the torment of hatred and illusions in hell, although the leader of the Wind Demon clan is not as enlightened as [Yuan Ce] in his spiritual practice, able to see through the illusions, he is aware of his deep sins. Overwhelmed with remorse, he kneels with his clan before [Yuan Ce] in tears, putting an end to the battle.
2:2:41|2:2:52|[Yuan Ce] nodded to the Wind Demon Clan, then called the giant ape under the roof, and turned around to lift the Konglong Flail with both hands, kneeling towards [Di Renjie], and said,
2:3:2|2:3:13|After returning the Dragon-Taming Mace to its rightful owner, [Di Renjie] slowly knelt down, showing humility. He did not dare to be presumptuous, as he had already knelt beside [Yuan Ce] during the grand ceremony. Now, he received the Dragon-Taming Mace with both hands, bowing his head in a gesture of respect.
2:3:13|2:3:20|The giant ape stood up, pounding its chest with both fists and laughing towards the sky, signaling the end of the battle in this place.
2:3:20|2:3:35|Upon hearing this laughter, the guard outside the temple relaxed his expression. As the people here stood up, each of them holding weapons in their arms, [Tang Gao Zong] spoke.
2:3:38|2:3:44|He also disguised himself and encouraged the guards before speaking.
2:3:45|2:3:58|The common people in Fangsi Temple had long been alienated by [Di Renjie], in order to prevent harm to the innocent and those who stayed behind. The Jinwu Guards disguised themselves as ordinary people or changed into civilian clothes to confuse the foreign tribes, making it easier to catch them off guard. This is [Di Renjie]'s last line of defense.
2:3:58|2:4:6|The turmoil caused by the sorcerers has been settled, with [Di Renjie] strategizing to ensure the safety of the Tang Dynasty, fulfilling the trust placed in him by [Tang Gao Zong].
