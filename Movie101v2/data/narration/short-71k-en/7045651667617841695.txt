0:3:58|0:4:3|The mysterious figure stepped out, threw back the cloak to reveal his true identity, startling [Master Long].
0:4:3|0:4:9|Large beads of sweat kept rolling down [Master Long]'s face,
0:4:21|0:4:31|Aunt Zhang quickly made a dish that made everyone present frown at the taste.
0:5:11|0:5:36|Aunt Zhang scooped up a spoonful of soup and put it in her mouth. After struggling to swallow it, her pupils instantly dilated. The taste of the soup spread in her mouth, passed through her throat into her stomach, causing unbearable pain, and she collapsed convulsing on the ground.
0:5:56|0:6:2|Suddenly, a voice behind him caught his attention. When he turned around, he saw a person holding his dark cuisine and continuously feeding him with chopsticks.
0:6:37|0:6:48|The appearance of the culinary god [Lu Xiaoyu] caused a stir among the group, with everyone rushing up to ask for autographs. Amid the crowd, [Lu Xiaoyu] left, and the secretary approached [Boss Cai], whispering something in his ear.
0:8:50|0:9:0|[Lu Xiaoyu] said it was tough, but then picked up the tissue next to him. The next morning, [Xiao Tian] woke up immediately when he saw the floor covered with tissues.
0:9:43|0:9:54|[Xiao Tian] accidentally pushed open a door in the mall,
0:9:54|0:10:5|Outside the door is a steep slope. The two of them stepped on air in succession, rolled down from the slope, and bumped into another door. Outside the door is a whole new world, the first thing that catches the eye is a child eating noodles.
0:10:10|0:10:19|Lu Xiaoyu's gaze shifted from the child who couldn't get noodles to the street called Fallen Street pointed out by Xiao Tian.
0:10:31|0:10:47|The street is surrounded by tall buildings, with low-rise buildings contrasting sharply with them. The street is constantly crowded with people. In front of a small restaurant, the graceful [Sister Mei] is singing, placing her exquisitely cooked lobster on the table for the customers.
0:10:47|0:10:57|Grilled meat expert [Li Jianguo] is practicing weightlifting with canned beef, while tech geek [Yong Jun] is shouting at a few kids on the noisy street, teaching them chemical equations.
0:10:57|0:11:2|[Lu Xiaoyu] had her face pressed against [Xiao Tian]'s arm, carefully observing the people on the street.
0:11:2|0:11:15|[Xiao Tian] turned his head and looked down at him. Sensing something was wrong, he stood up and walked towards the street, arriving at the front of a small eatery claiming to be the only designated authentic snack shop on Fallen Street.
0:11:15|0:11:20|In addition to selling snacks and hot pot, this shop also offers traditional massage.
0:11:20|0:11:29|The two looked at the exaggerated sign, then skeptically at the location shown on the phone map, their faces filled with disbelief, but still walked into the shop.
0:12:4|0:12:18|Boss [Jerry] immediately became excited when he heard this. He closed the door of the restaurant with his squeaky light-up shoes, then opened his coat.
0:12:54|0:13:3|The two continued to walk outside, with [Jerry] cursing under his breath.
0:13:34|0:13:37|[Xiao Tian] left Fallen Street, [Lu Xiaoyu] entered the house alone.
0:15:1|0:15:14|Turning to leave, [Lu Xiaoyu] was once again stopped by [Jerry]. He approached the smirking [Jerry] and couldn't help but snort coldly.
0:15:25|0:15:41|[Jerry] hoisted a heavy weapon, [Lu Xiaoyu] ran around trying to escape, [Jerry] aimed at him and fired, but instead of bullets, water shot out of the gun. [Lu Xiaoyu] dodged the water column, but a few screams were heard, causing him to look back in terror.
0:15:41|0:15:54|Time seemed to slow down, as Aunt Zhang, who was trimming a customer's hair in the barbershop, involuntarily started to tremble. It turned out that the water column sprayed onto Boss Cai's face, causing everyone present to hold their breath and focus, unsure of what to do.
0:15:54|0:16:10|[Lu Xiaoyu] left the shop at rocket speed, while [Jerry] closed the door of the snack bar. [Lu Xiaoyu] hid in the alley, covering her pounding heart, breathing heavily. Meanwhile, [Boss Cai's Secretary] blow-dried Boss Cai's hair and sprayed styling gel on it.
0:16:22|0:16:30|In the moment of turning around, the popcorn machine suddenly made a loud bang, making [Boss Cai] completely furious, shouting hysterically.
0:16:32|0:16:45|The fallen street instantly turned into chaos, with people fleeing in all directions from the snack stall, screams filling the air. [Boss Cai]'s henchmen smashed tables and chairs, causing a sense of panic among the crowd.
0:16:45|0:16:54|Adults and children bent over to protect their heads and hide inside the house, no one dared to stop the melee. [Boss Cai] looked satisfied at everything in front of him.
0:16:58|0:17:4|Beside him, [Boss Cai's Secretary] also looked on in amazement, while [Boss Cai] held his hand in front of his eyes, not wanting him to see this bloody scene.
0:17:4|0:17:12|In the midst of chaos, the child eating noodles still held his bowl and was bumped by a sturdy butt, causing him to stagger and almost fall.
0:17:12|0:17:21|Fortunately, the barbecue expert [Li Jianguo] acted quickly and caught him, along with the bowl, safely landing. Then he patted the boy's head and said.
0:17:41|0:17:51|Boss Cai smiled slyly and said the most vicious words, the little brothers once again picked up their weapons and prepared to launch an attack on Li Jianguo. Li Jianguo firmly caught the bamboo pole stabbing towards him, standing still.
0:17:51|0:18:2|After spinning a few times, the bamboo pole was thrown out. The bamboo pole pierced through a lamb leg, then stuck on the wall. [Li Jianguo] then kicked the stove burning charcoal under the lamb leg and successively sprinkled cumin powder.
0:18:2|0:18:12|Red pepper powder and salt are evenly sprinkled on the lamb leg. After patting the salt off his hands, he raised both hands high like an Olympic athlete, waving and smiling at the crowd.
0:18:12|0:18:22|Then the right leg steps back, the toes push off the ground, bending over to start running towards the direction of the lamb's leg in front. After running a distance for takeoff, leaping over a goat toy,
0:18:22|0:18:30|With both hands grabbing the bamboo pole on the wall, Lu Xiaoyu flipped the pole like a gymnast, the lamb leg at the end refined by charcoal fire.
0:19:25|0:19:38|Lobster Beauty [Sister Mei] and tech geek [Yong Jun] also joined the cooking competition. The three of them showed off their skills by making their signature dishes. [Sister Mei] was skilled and experienced, swiftly preparing a variety of spices and ingredients with a wave of her hands.
0:19:38|0:19:45|[Yong Jun] puts on protective goggles and quickly presses several switches on the machine. The indispensable duo of instant noodles and ham sausages.
0:19:45|0:19:56|After passing through the fan and being sliced into evenly thick pieces, coated with flour, and then baked in a high-temperature flame, it landed in the instant noodle pot. [Li Jianguo] accurately controlled the timing.
0:19:56|0:20:4|After the final somersault in mid-air, landing steadily on the ground and releasing both hands, [Sister Mei] and [Yong Jun] also completed the preparation of delicious dishes at the same time.
0:20:6|0:20:30|The exquisitely arranged dishes were placed in front of [Boss Cai], who sliced open the skin of the lamb leg, revealing the tender meat inside. The aroma wafted into the noses of his followers, causing someone to uncontrollably swallow saliva.
0:20:40|0:20:49|[Boss Cai] swallowed the lamb and then cracked open the lobster's head to eat it, the delicious taste spreading in his mouth.
0:20:58|0:21:7|The lingering spiciness made [Boss Cai] feel like he was back in infancy, then he tasted [Yong Jun]'s instant noodle pot, unbelievably he was conquered once again.
0:21:24|0:21:27|The taste of instant noodles brought [Boss Cai] back to his college days.
0:21:27|0:21:30|The people behind rushed forward after hearing it.
0:21:38|0:21:47|Sister Mei couldn't help but comment, just as she finished speaking a few words, the plate in front of Boss Cai was already empty, not even a drop of soup left.
0:21:50|0:21:55|[Boss Cai] bowed to express his gratitude, then left Fallen Street surrounded by his henchmen.
0:21:55|0:22:2|The villagers all came out after learning that it was safe.
0:22:4|0:22:10|The secretary snapped her fingers, and the villagers turned and ran, turning cheers into screams.
0:22:10|0:22:17|Dozens of henchmen who turned and left suddenly made a surprise attack, causing chaos once again and sweeping through the entire street.
0:22:17|0:22:24|Li Jianguo, Sister Mei, and Yong Jun stayed in place. As a henchman prepared to strike with a heavy blow, his body suddenly leaned backward.
0:22:24|0:22:31|At the moment of falling to the ground, a durian hit him in the face, followed by the buzzing sound of an engine in the air.
0:22:31|0:22:39|A motorcycle roared down and came to a steady stop on the ground. Deep in the alley, [Lu Xiaoyu] cautiously watched the situation on the street.
0:22:39|0:22:47|He saw the person getting off the motorcycle wearing a thick muscle suit, wearing a helmet on his head, fighting alone and knocking down one little brother after another.
0:22:47|0:22:55|Her momentum scared [Boss Cai] nearby, causing his henchmen to be no match for her, one by one falling to the ground and unable to get up.
0:22:55|0:23:3|Seeing the man violently throw one of the henchmen, [Lu Xiaoyu] couldn't help but widen her eyes, her body straight against the cement pillar without moving.
0:23:4|0:23:17|Thinking the fight was over, a disgruntled henchman rushed forward, only to be knocked down by just two walnuts by a man who then stuffed the walnut meat into his mouth. This man is none other than the fallen street thug known as the female Zhang Fei.
0:23:17|0:23:28|Powerful girl [Xiao Man]. The beaten henchmen scrambled away from the scene, following a shout from [Boss Cai's Secretary].
0:23:28|0:23:31|Four men with hairstyles resembling the Four Heavenly Kings of Hong Kong appear, and [Xiao Man] quickly runs towards them.
0:23:34|0:23:43|The Four King Kong ran towards Boss Cai when they saw the situation, leaving Boss Cai isolated. He took the opportunity to hide inside a small stall on the street.
0:23:43|0:23:52|[Boss Cai] happened to see [Lu Xiaoyu] hiding in the alley. He gestured for [Lu Xiaoyu] to charge forward, and [Xiao Man] received applause.
0:23:53|0:24:1|[Lu Xiaoyu], under pressure, mustered up courage and grabbed a wooden stick before running towards the street, but the escaping Four King Kong suddenly appeared.
0:24:5|0:24:21|One person forcefully kicked open the old popcorn machine, sending it flying towards [Xiao Man]. Still immersed in the joy of victory, [Xiao Man] didn't have time to dodge. At that moment, [Lu Xiaoyu] rushed towards her and accidentally blocked the flying machine with his back.
0:24:28|0:24:48|[Lu Xiaoyu] and [Xiao Man] fell to the ground, popcorn raining down from the sky. [Lu Xiaoyu] felt dizzy and collapsed on the street, ending the chaotic night. The next day, [Lu Xiaoyu] woke up on a strange bed, hearing indistinct slurping sounds in his ears. The annoying noise kept him from sleeping soundly as he slowly opened his eyes.
0:24:48|0:24:54|Seeing the person in front of him, he flapped and sat up.
0:26:47|0:26:51|Staring blankly at the roaring Xiao Tian, Lu Xiaoyu immediately grabbed and ran outside, followed by the people inside the house.
0:27:30|0:27:57|After pulling back the curtain of the door, he saw at a glance the delicious cooking secret book in Xiao Man's hand. Pressed to the ground, Lu Xiaoyu blurted out this sentence in a moment of desperation. Xiao Man gradually put away her unruly smile, Yong Jun and Sister Mei were stunned, Li Jianguo glared at Lu Xiaoyu with hatred, Jerry regained his senses and ran to the balcony.
0:28:4|0:28:10|The bronze gong team and lion dance team immediately started to boil with excitement.
0:28:47|0:28:52|Hearing this, [Xiao Man] executed a shoulder throw, knocking him down to the ground.
0:31:3|0:31:8|On the street, [Xiao Man] holds a banknote with [Lu Xiaoyu]'s portrait on it, feeling extremely incredulous.
0:31:13|0:31:22|[Li Jianguo] seized the opportunity to sneak up on [Lu Xiaoyu] from behind, but just as he was about to succeed, he was knocked down to the ground by [Xiao Man] with a fly swatter.
0:31:33|0:31:42|Sister Mei and Yong Jun arrived just in time, bowing to Lu Xiaoyu with Li Jianguo in tow. Sister Mei almost burst out laughing.
0:33:10|0:33:22|[Lu Xiaoyu] laughed and threw away the scepter in her hand, following [Xiao Man] to a tree. After leaning against the ancient tree for a while in contemplation, [Xiao Man] turned around and said to [Lu Xiaoyu].
0:33:44|0:33:48|[Xiao Man]'s lips trembled slightly, and her index fingers stirred nervously in front of her chest.
0:33:58|0:34:18|The words were not finished when [Lu Xiaoyu] was knocked down again, [Xiao Man] handed the secret book wrapped in newspaper to [Lu Xiaoyu] straightforwardly, [Lu Xiaoyu] and [Xiao Tian] looked at each other excitedly, and then handed the secret to [Boss Cai].
0:34:50|0:35:4|[Lu Xiaoyu] was kicked out by [Boss Cai] because of the hybrid rice knowledge given by [Xiao Man]. He returned to the decadent street with a heavy heart, determined to obtain the secret manual. However, he was pulled into the house by [Sister Mei] halfway.
0:35:37|0:35:54|[Sister Mei] turned and left, [Lu Xiaoyu] stared at the photo, and the next moment he suddenly realized, transforming into [Xiao Man]'s mother, wearing a flowing wig and a checkered skirt. He went to a park and arranged to meet [Xiao Man].
0:35:54|0:36:7|Xiao Man's eyes were fixed on the familiar clothes, Lu Xiaoyu turned slowly, lifting the hair on her face, only to be immediately attacked by Xiao Man.
0:37:33|0:37:40|Lu Xiaoyu, who was repeatedly interrupted during the conversation, couldn't take it anymore. He was filled with anger as he chased after the old man.
0:38:48|0:38:52|[Lu Xiaoyu] nervously followed [Xiao Man], rubbing his hands and feet, unsure of what to do.
0:39:12|0:39:24|[Lu Xiaoyu] said awkwardly, and suddenly the embassy they lived in started shaking. [Xiao Man] had already excitedly rushed to the door. At this moment, the embassy lifted off the ground and floated in mid-air. [Lu Xiaoyu] looked uneasily at everything in front of him.
0:39:30|0:39:39|On the side, [Xiao Tian] was desperately banging on the window of the crane. The drowsy crane operator completely ignored him until [Xiao Tian] climbed onto the window, finally catching his attention.
0:39:39|0:39:55|Xiao Tian rushed into the driver's cabin and fought with Master Long for control of the steering post. During the struggle, the embassy shook, causing Lu Xiaoyu to kneel down in fear, clutching Xiao Man's clothes. Xiao Man, however, was particularly excited and even tried to stretch out her arms.
0:40:8|0:40:18|Xiao Tian's improper operation caused the embassy to continue shaking, but [Xiao Man] was very happy. She held onto the railing with one hand, while the other arm stretched out, immersing herself in the excitement.
0:40:18|0:40:20|[Lu Xiaoyu] tightly closed her eyes.
0:40:20|0:40:31|The weightless feeling made his palms sweat, his heart pounding wildly, screams escaping from his throat. After figuring out the trick of the control lever, Xiao Tian skillfully landed the helicopter in mid-air.
0:40:31|0:40:38|Created a rare moment of solitude for [Lu Xiaoyu] and [Xiao Man], sitting with their legs dangling on the edge of the embassy.
0:41:54|0:42:1|[Lu Xiaoyu] looked at the starry sky and fell into childhood memories.
0:42:37|0:42:51|The neighbor looked down on the leftovers brought back by Lu Xiaoyu's mom from the construction site. Lu Xiaoyu followed secretly to the site, and when he saw his mother packing the leftovers, he turned around and chose to run away from home.
0:42:54|0:43:0|On a stormy day, Lu Xiaoyu's mom anxiously searches for her son, but accidentally slips and falls to the ground.
0:43:0|0:43:8|When Lu Xiaoyu arrived at the hospital, her mother had already passed away. Since that day, every time it rains, Lu Xiaoyu always has nightmares.
0:43:33|0:43:37|[Lu Xiaoyu] looked at the dog not far away, feeling a cold sweat.
0:44:24|0:44:36|The next morning, as the dawn light lifted the veil of night, the OCD-afflicted [Japanese Samurai] Master Shin Uemon arrived at Fallen Street. He was dressed in samurai attire and carried 67 swords of various lengths in front of him.
0:44:38|0:44:52|The bizarre and terrifying outfit scared the children on the Fallen Street, causing the vendors to rush into the house and lock the door. Wherever he went, no one dared to show up. He walked to the depths of the Fallen Street, and what he saw in front of him was a big surprise.
0:44:52|0:45:2|Li Jianguo provocatively looked at him with a bamboo pole in his hand, while Sister Mei held a knife in each hand, puffing on an e-cigarette and holding a hot electric appliance from the hot water kettle.
0:45:36|0:45:42|The three-minute countdown begins, and the ingredients and bowls needed by the new right back are neatly placed on the table.
0:45:42|0:45:49|Slowly cleaning a short knife, [Yong Jun] and the other two coldly snorted, revealing the hidden killer move behind them.
0:45:49|0:46:3|Lu Xiaoyu and Xiao Man were seen crouching in front of a table, placing various bottles and cups on the edge of the table, letting them teeter on the dangerous edge. The new right guard couldn't stand it and quickly set them all upright.
0:46:44|0:46:51|But the new midfield is always missing this piece, the new right back can't stand it anymore, and rushes towards the electrical control room.
0:46:52|0:47:10|With less than 7 seconds left, [Yong Jun] and his team were determined to win, shouting out in victory. The new right defender rushed back to the cooking station, panting heavily. His sword at his waist swiftly moved in and out, and in the final second, a delicate dish appeared on the table. The team looked at the complex dish in disbelief.
0:47:51|0:48:1|The new right back uses both hands and feet to passionately interpret the cooking process just now.
0:48:1|0:48:3|[Lu Xiaoyu] couldn't help but let out a cry.
0:48:3|0:48:10|[Xiao Man] couldn't help but laugh at the story of the New Right Guard, and the New Right Guard continued speaking.
0:48:12|0:48:17|Several blades are drawn together, the gleam and shadows of the swords are clearly visible.
0:48:17|0:48:26|Food crumbs were flying in the air, and in just a few seconds, the new right guard retracted the knife into the handle, and at the moment he looked up, the timer happened to reset to zero.
0:48:26|0:48:34|Then a dish with rich ingredients and exquisite presentation was born. The rhetoric of the New Right Gate left the five people in front of him speechless.
0:48:34|0:48:44|Li Jianguo, Sister Mei, and Yong Jun stepped forward, each picking up a chopstick and stuffing ingredients into their mouths, the taste of seafood spreading in their mouths.
0:48:45|0:48:54|At one point, the three of them seemed to be in an underwater world, where the heads of various deep-sea fish all seemed to have turned into the brain of the New Right Gate, shouting and screaming.
0:48:54|0:49:2|The delicious seafood overwhelmed the minds of the three, causing them to lose their senses, and they all screamed at the same time.
0:49:23|0:49:35|The New Right Defender shouted loudly, wanting to quickly obtain the secret manual. With the New Right Defender's shout, three people simultaneously fell to the ground.
0:49:35|0:49:44|[Lu Xiaoyu] asked. [Boss Cai] arrived at the scene.
0:49:56|0:50:7|While speaking, Boss Cai's sweater was suddenly pulled by a thread, and within seconds the entire sweater disappeared. Following the thread of the sweater, Boss Cai locked onto Jerry's snack shop.
0:50:7|0:50:14|At the moment of rushing into the snack bar, the door was locked. The shop was pitch black, and suddenly a beam of light darted around.
0:50:14|0:50:28|A pair of eyes wandered in the darkness, and Lu Xiaoyu swung his sword to try to stop the flickering lights. In the moment when the sword and the lights touched, the lights came on in the room, and Jerry was seen sitting cross-legged in mid-air.
0:50:33|0:50:40|With a swift strike, the Green Dragon Cane in [Xin Youweimen]'s hands was cut in half at the waist, but [Jerry] hanging in mid-air remained motionless.
0:50:40|0:50:43|Everyone stared in disbelief at the scene unfolding before them, frozen in place.
0:50:43|0:50:52|[Xin Youweimen] pounded his head and said. [Lu Xiaoyu] vaguely saw the fishing line in [Jerry]'s hand.
0:51:43|0:51:54|Turning around, [Jerry] was nowhere to be seen. The doors in front opened one by one, and [Jerry] stood in the kitchen, slamming several colorful doughs on the cutting board, rhythmically patting the dough.
0:51:54|0:51:57|[Lu Xiaoyu] stared intently at the scene before her.
0:51:58|0:52:7|Jerry's hands were like sharp knives, slicing the meat evenly and dropping it into the hot pot. Xiao Tian couldn't help but exclaim at the sight.
0:52:7|0:52:14|[Jerry] didn't mind at all, and used his palms and elbows to knead the other dough.
0:52:14|0:52:26|After kneading the dough, he tossed several colors of dough into the air and repeatedly slapped them, transforming the dough balls into strips. The noodles spun rapidly in the air, emitting a dazzling light.
0:52:28|0:52:33|After seeing this, everyone was once again stunned, and during this process, [Jerry] seemed to have turned into a young teenager.
0:53:0|0:53:9|The noodles can be stretched infinitely long, long enough to wrap around the Earth. [Jerry] then takes the stretched noodles and knits them into a fabric shape.
0:53:9|0:53:15|Jerry's actions were a first for Xiao Man, her mouth had been open since the beginning. In no time, the noodles were cooked.
0:53:29|0:53:35|The new right back held a bowl, picked up a chopstick of colorful noodles, and couldn't stop eating after taking a bite.
0:53:35|0:53:48|After satisfyingly finishing the last sip of soup, he exhaled a breath of hot air, neatly placed the empty bowl and chopsticks on the table, then knelt down with a thud, his mouth twitching, tears continuously streaming from his eyes.
0:53:58|0:54:7|They listened eagerly as the new right back continued.
0:54:7|0:54:17|With the narration of the New Right Gate, the scene returns to when [Jerry] and [Tom] were young, as the New Right Gate continues to narrate.
0:55:22|0:55:29|Turning around and picking up the money counter to start counting, the secretary understood Boss Cai's expression and immediately called the Four King Kong.
0:55:42|0:55:49|With a scream from Jerry, the camera pulls away from his face. Seeing four short knives stuck in Lu Xiaoyu's back.
0:55:59|0:56:3|The Four King Kong escaped from the snack shop by standing upside down in a neat formation.
0:56:28|0:56:32|Just as he finished speaking, [Boss Cai] was suddenly dressed in a full-body knitted suit.
0:57:15|0:57:27|[Lu Xiaoyu] stuffed a piece of bread in his mouth to bite on, trying to alleviate the pain, while [Xiao Man] applied wound medicine to her hands, preparing to treat him.
0:57:32|0:57:38|[Xiao Man] applied the medicine on his wound, seeing no response, she poked him twice with her fingers.
0:58:10|0:58:27|Upon being discovered by [Xiao Man], [Lu Xiaoyu] picked up the brick beside him. Without much thought, he immediately stood up upon hearing the words, the brick slipping from his hand. After mentally preparing himself, he spoke.
0:58:59|0:59:5|Knowing all this, [Xiao Man] not only wasn't angry, but also happily held [Lu Xiaoyu]'s hand and entered the circle.
0:59:10|0:59:19|[Xiao Man] recalls every moment when [Lu Xiaoyu] confessed his love and she accepted.
1:0:44|1:0:49|[Xiao Man] hadn't finished speaking when she turned her head and [Lu Xiaoyu] had already disappeared without a trace.
1:2:31|1:2:47|[Lu Xiaoyu] ignored [Xiao Tian]'s advice and in a fit of anger, stepped on [Xiao Tian]'s robotic cat, causing it to break. [Xiao Tian] picked up the robotic cat and walked away. After packing up his belongings, [Xiao Tian] said angrily. [Lu Xiaoyu] sneered and threw out a harsh remark.
1:2:48|1:2:53|[Xiao Tian] left with a pout, while [Lu Xiaoyu] looked incredulous.
1:2:53|1:2:57|[Xiao Tian] walked out the door and threw the deposit from [Boss Cai] towards him.
1:2:57|1:3:3|He looked down at the money and then at the entrance. Thinking that [Xiao Tian] had really left this time,
1:3:3|1:3:11|He helplessly placed his hands on his hips, then looked up at the night sky. [Xiao Man] stood on the balcony, gazing at the same sky with him.
1:3:11|1:3:22|After a while, [Lu Xiaoyu] arrived at the entrance of the funeral parlor. The funeral parlor was eerily quiet at night, with the occasional strange caw of a crow. Beads of secret sweat formed on [Lu Xiaoyu]'s forehead.
1:3:22|1:3:29|But he still walked in. Looking around, the lobby corridor was filled with various wreaths and paper figures.
1:3:29|1:3:42|Sweat had soaked his face, neck, and even his close-fitting short sleeves. He walked towards the end of the dim corridor, occasionally turning around to look back. He seemed to hear terrifying howls and women's laughter.
1:3:42|1:3:49|He then lowered his head, closed his eyes, and quickly ran forward. After entering a door, he looked back in the direction he had just run from.
1:3:49|1:3:59|After noticing that nothing strange came out, he breathed a sigh of relief. He patted his chest, but then turned around to see a scene that made him break out in a cold sweat, his lips trembling uncontrollably.
1:3:59|1:4:3|Accidentally entering a room, they found themselves in a morgue.
1:4:3|1:4:8|[Lu Xiaoyu] slowly turned around, wanting to leave, but the door that had just been closed wouldn't budge no matter how hard she tried.
1:4:8|1:4:20|After shaking it hard a few times and finding the door still wouldn't open, he turned around and quickly spotted the emergency exit across from him. Looking at the bodies on both sides, he grimaced and swallowed hard.
1:4:20|1:4:30|Clearing his throat again, Lu Xiaoyu took a shaky step forward, carefully moving towards the body. He stared at the nearby corpse for a moment before quickly looking away.
1:4:52|1:5:2|Suddenly, the four bodies next to him moved closer, and [Lu Xiaoyu] couldn't grab them directly facing the ground. As he slowly regained consciousness, he slowly opened his eyes.
1:5:2|1:5:11|In a daze, he saw the character "汤" on a sign in front of him.
1:5:13|1:5:27|Lying on the ground, his consciousness not fully awake yet, the scene in front of his eyes was bizarre. A large spoonful of soup was placed in front of him.
1:7:10|1:7:29|Lu Xiaoyu's words successfully angered him, his eyes instantly turned bloodshot, and he forcefully grabbed Lu Xiaoyu's neck, feeding a bowl of chili soup to the customer. The customer smashed the bowl on the ground, and their emotions immediately spiraled out of control, their actions becoming extremely frenzied.
1:7:29|1:7:36|[Tom] immediately changed her outfit after learning the news from [Lu Xiaoyu]. She tied up her messy hair.
1:7:36|1:7:45|Wearing a cheongsam, [Boss Cai] and others arrived at the entrance of the snack bar. However, she hesitated to go in, nervously rubbing her hands on her abdomen.
1:8:40|1:8:43|Listening to the voices inside the shop, with [Boss Cai] fanning the flames, [Tom]'s fists hardened.
1:8:43|1:8:51|The anger emanated from his body, causing the house to tremble. [Tom] pushed open the door and appeared in front of [Jerry].
1:9:5|1:9:7|Hearing [Jerry] accurately calling out his own name.
1:9:7|1:9:14|Tom observes carefully.
1:10:11|1:10:21|Former lovers who were once inseparable are now at odds, with [Tom] filled with hatred in his eyes. He angrily swings a wooden pot lid towards [Jerry], who skillfully catches the spinning lid.
1:10:21|1:10:27|And he threw him to the side, the lid grazed Boss Cai's head and shaved off a piece of his hair.
1:10:27|1:10:39|[Xiao Man] laughed at the wrong time, but stopped when she saw no one else laughing. The competition officially began, with [Tom] taking the lead. She threw several chili bombs into the pot, and they exploded in the hot pot.
1:10:39|1:10:50|The broth instantly turned blood red, while [Jerry] casually sprinkled a few spices into the pot, making it look effortless but with hidden intensity.
1:10:50|1:11:1|The impact of the seasoning broke through the iron pot, turning the soup into the color of milk. The soup in the big pot became clearly distinct, with the spicy pot and the clear soup pot engaging in a taste battle.
1:11:1|1:11:19|[Tom] increases the firepower, and several fierce wolves appear in the spicy pot broth, roaring ferociously. One of the wolves leaps into the air, [Jerry] faces the terror, arms crossed in front of his chest, but quickly reacts by increasing the firepower and adding a few lily leaves into the pot. The broth immediately starts boiling and bubbling.
1:11:20|1:11:32|The wolf in the spicy pot launched an attack, trying to cross the boundary of the mandarin duck pot. Just as it was about to leap over, a white crane slowly rose from the clear soup, spreading its huge wings to block the wolf's attack.
1:11:32|1:11:39|The wolf fell back into the spicy pot, blending with the soup, while the white crane stewed back into the clear broth, and the boiling soup returned to calmness.
1:11:39|1:11:49|Tom showed no signs of backing down, she skillfully placed several abnormal chili peppers in the pot, and dozens of fierce wolves suddenly appeared, rushing towards the clear soup pot.
1:11:49|1:11:56|[Jerry] added lily bulbs and tremella into the clear soup pot, the white crane stretched its long neck across the boundary, trying to intimidate the wolf with this.
1:11:56|1:12:2|The wolf, ignoring all boundaries, leaped into the clear soup pot and bit tightly onto the crane's wings.
1:12:2|1:12:7|The White Crane screamed in pain, flapping its wings and knocking all the evil wolves back into the hot pot.
1:12:7|1:12:13|The pot returned to calm again, leaving [Boss Cai] and others stunned by the thrilling showdown.
1:12:13|1:12:24|The fallen street residents also widened their eyes in disbelief, watching the scene in front of them. Before everyone could come to their senses, Tom gathered various fresh and spicy seasonings and threw them all into the pot.
1:12:24|1:12:39|The soup in the hot pot began to bubble, and many sharp triangular shapes appeared, followed by a shape resembling a claw. Accompanied by strange noises, a monster with terrifying horns on its head and layers of patterns on its back emerged from the soup.
1:12:39|1:12:44|Its mouth, with its interlocking fangs, roared while also splattering out some extremely spicy soup.
1:12:46|1:12:59|[Tom] was controlling the monster preparing to attack, when suddenly a golden light appeared from the opposite side, mercilessly piercing through the monster. The hot soup splattered on [Boss Cai]'s face, he wiped it off expressionlessly with a handkerchief, then looked at the character transformed by [Jerry].
1:13:7|1:13:10|Tom launched another attack, while Jerry defended himself with his own skills.
1:13:10|1:13:18|Suddenly, two kinds of notifications broke through the boundaries of the pot, and the past of [Jerry] and [Tom] when they were young also came rushing out.
1:13:18|1:13:33|At that time, the two of them were brewing the same pot of soup together, with [Jerry] standing behind [Tom], leaning closely against her. They held the same ladle, immersed in the atmosphere of love, even adding seasoning to the soup with a sweet touch.
1:13:33|1:13:38|When Tom was smoked in the eyes, Jerry was very annoyed and quickly extinguished the fire.
1:13:38|1:13:43|[Tom] wiped away the tears that were smoked out, looking at the extinguished fire on the stove and asked.
1:13:49|1:13:55|Two people in love look at each other with silly smiles, their eyes filled with each other.
1:13:55|1:14:6|The two elderly men's eyes were filled with hatred, similar actions, similar scenes, making the powerful [Tom] recall his youth. In this match, he
1:14:6|1:14:13|In the end, she softened her heart, tears swirling in her eyes, and her choked voice caught the attention of [Jerry].
1:14:13|1:14:14|He looked at [Tom].
1:14:14|1:14:21|Tom suddenly increased his firepower, knocking Jerry to the ground with a shockwave. A tear from Tom fell into the soup.
1:14:21|1:14:29|The spicy broth quickly spread throughout the pot, engulfing the clear broth pot, turning the entire pot into a spicy pot.
1:14:29|1:14:36|[Tom] gritted his teeth and glared fiercely at the blood-spitting [Jerry].
1:15:0|1:15:3|[Xiao Man] walked to the pot with a ladle in hand, ignoring everything else.
1:15:3|1:15:14|Tom couldn't help but snort at her youthful arrogance. Xiao Man made a confident gesture to the grandfather behind her and the people on the decadent street, then scooped up half a spoonful of soup with a spoon.
1:15:14|1:15:19|As it got closer to her mouth, she couldn't help but take a sharp breath. At this moment, she had no way out.
1:15:19|1:15:32|With a forced smile, she drank the spicy soup in the spoon, while the people on the decadent street looked at her with pity. [Tom] and [Boss Cai] had disdain written all over their faces. [Xiao Man] wiped her mouth with the scarf on her chest and let out a satisfied sigh.
1:15:32|1:15:34|He looks around at the people with a smug expression.
1:15:35|1:15:46|Suddenly she felt something was wrong, the soup that had just gone down her throat burned her stomach, a fiery sensation shot straight to her head, her throat was also being roasted, she opened her mouth not knowing what to do.
1:16:22|1:16:36|After the crowd, a man walked up, although he was looking down, [Xiao Man] still recognized him at a glance, he was the one who had been away for more than 36 hours, [Lu Xiaoyu].
1:16:49|1:16:58|[Boss Cai] clenched his fists after speaking and started punching and kicking [Lu Xiaoyu]. [Lu Xiaoyu] didn't fight back, just kept using his hands to protect his head.
1:17:6|1:17:22|Boss Cai kicked Lu Xiaoyu in front of Xiao Man. Xiao Man clenched her fists, and before Tom could finish speaking, she couldn't hold back anymore. She rushed towards Lu Xiaoyu, who fearfully raised his hands to defend himself.
1:17:22|1:17:30|[Xiao Man] passed by, and her fist landed heavily on [Boss Cai]'s head, which was something [Tom] never expected.
1:17:42|1:17:47|Xiao Man vented her anger and walked towards Lu Xiaoyu.
1:18:5|1:18:23|[Xiao Man] reminded [Lu Xiaoyu] of the night they first met. When the popcorn machine was flying towards her, she saw with her own eyes that [Lu Xiaoyu] could have dodged it, but he still rushed to her without hesitation and blocked the machine for her. [Lu Xiaoyu] sighed, struggled in his heart for a moment, and said,
1:18:46|1:19:3|After [Xiao Man] finished speaking, she turned her back to [Lu Xiaoyu] and reached out a hand behind her. [Lu Xiaoyu] lowered his head to look at [Xiao Man] reaching out to him, feeling conflicted inside. He slowly reached out his hand, but then stopped halfway in the air. After a moment of hesitation, he finally grabbed [Xiao Man]'s hand.
1:19:3|1:19:14|[Xiao Man] finally got his reply, smiling as he turned to look at [Lu Xiaoyu]. However, [Lu Xiaoyu] had a fierce look in his eyes as he forcefully pulled her towards him, just like [Xiao Man] used to treat him before.
1:19:14|1:19:22|Grabbing her arm, he forcefully threw her into the air, executing a 180-degree shoulder throw. [Xiao Man] landed heavily on the ground.
1:19:22|1:19:29|At this moment, he seemed to have lost his sense of pain just like [Lu Xiaoyu], with no perception, just staring blankly at the sky.
1:19:34|1:19:37|[Lu Xiaoyu] coldly finished this sentence, and [Boss Cai] and others burst into laughter immediately.
1:19:37|1:19:40|But the tears on [Lu Xiaoyu]'s face have already betrayed him.
1:19:43|1:19:50|[Xiao Man] lay despairingly on the ground, as the people of Fallen Street shouted her name and moved towards her position, then the entire Fallen Street plunged into darkness.
1:19:50|1:19:59|Boss Cai led the construction team to thoroughly clean up Fallen Street, causing Li Jianguo's barbecue shop to collapse and Jerry's snack bar to cease to exist.
1:19:59|1:20:10|Instead, Shanjit Group's reputation soared. Not only did the company expand rapidly, but it also received Tom's blessing. Newspapers harshly criticized Jerry for burning the secret manual and destroying cultural heritage. Boss Cai cleaned up.
1:20:10|1:20:15|The dirty and chaotic decadent street allowed him to make a fortune.
1:20:15|1:20:21|While [Lu Xiaoyu] lurked in the bar every day, a glamorous woman dressed in a cold manner swayed her body in front of him.
1:20:21|1:20:29|An ambiguous atmosphere enveloped the entire bar. [Xiao Man] sat in a hospital bed wearing patient clothing, with a table full of food in front of her.
1:20:29|1:20:39|She picked up a donut and took a bite, then grabbed a chicken nugget and stuffed it into her mouth. Before she could swallow, she picked up a hamburger and took a bite, causing her cheeks to bulge on both sides.
1:20:39|1:20:43|Lu Xiaoyu's departure reminded her of the scene when her mother left when she was a child.
1:20:43|1:20:50|She could only wait for her mother to come back and also wait for [Lu Xiaoyu] while eating hungrily.
1:20:50|1:21:3|The bitterness in her heart surged out all at once, [Xiao Man] burst into tears, unable to hold back her sobs, with half-chewed food spilling all over the table.
1:21:3|1:21:14|At the end of the drinking session, [Lu Xiaoyu] sat alone at the table, looking at the leftovers on the table. Like [Xiao Man] in the hospital, he couldn't help but burst into tears, tears streaming down uncontrollably.
1:21:15|1:21:23|He recalled the rainy day when he ran away from home, and also remembered the night he spent alone with [Xiao Man].
1:21:30|1:21:34|At this moment, he seemed to understand what [Xiao Man] said. His unconscious body began to wake up.
1:21:34|1:21:42|His heart began to convulse violently, the pain tearing at his nerves, throwing him into a sea of memories filled with [Xiao Man].
1:22:7|1:22:29|When the memory flashed back to the day when [Jerry] and [Tom] were competing, and he pushed [Xiao Man] to the ground, he almost couldn't breathe. The violent throbbing of his heart made him unable to stop scratching his chest, and his body was forced to curl up in the chair. He passed out in the memories full of [Xiao Man], and when he regained consciousness, he found himself on Xiao Tian's back.
1:23:47|1:24:1|[Jerry] said that the culinary god he mentioned is [Lu Xiaoyu]. [Lu Xiaoyu] has been suffering from heart disease after a serious injury, rolling in pain on the bed. Xiao Tian, upon seeing this, was deeply saddened, feeling that [Lu Xiaoyu] wouldn't make it through.
1:24:1|1:24:13|After a whole night passed, dawn finally arrived. [Lu Xiaoyu] stood on the embassy and looked into the distance. A heart attack unexpectedly opened his Governor Vessel, giving him the superpower of culinary skills.
1:24:13|1:24:27|The glaring morning sun and the crowing of the rooster disturbed Xiao Tian's peaceful dream. He rubbed his eyes, sat up groggily, and immediately widened his eyes upon seeing Lu Xiaoyu standing on the embassy roof. He quickly woke up and exclaimed excitedly.
1:24:43|1:24:50|To be on the safe side, the two of them went to a nearby snack stall, where the vendor was whistling leisurely, preparing ingredients.
1:24:50|1:24:53|Xiao Tian covered his mouth and nose from behind and pulled him away.
1:24:53|1:25:4|[Lu Xiaoyu] is now in front of the snack stall, ready to show off his skills. He throws the kitchen knife up and deftly catches it.
1:25:4|1:25:9|Flying towards the cutting board. Under his knife, the ingredients seemed to come alive and flew into the air one after another.
1:25:9|1:25:17|Still staring at the spatula and swinging his powerful arms, the two behind him were already dumbfounded, and in no time, a meal was ready.
1:25:19|1:25:29|[Xiao Tian] picked up a chopstick and stuffed it into the mouth of the small vendor, took a bite himself, chewed a few times, and then both of them spat it out.
1:25:48|1:25:54|The small vendor and [Xiao Tian] continued to wrestle with each other.
1:25:54|1:26:4|Lu Xiaoyu's heart was heavy, he heard Boss Cai's voice coming from the radio of a small vendor, Boss Cai was singing on the stage of a press conference, with the host, who had an explosive hairstyle, emoting beside him.
1:26:38|1:26:43|The three judges from the Culinary Association arrived at the scene and were guided to their seats by the staff.
1:26:56|1:27:5|The etiquette lady first presented a bouquet of flowers to Mr. Dong, then placed the certificate on the table in front of him. He took off his pen cap, ready to sign.
1:27:8|1:27:22|Wearing traditional Chinese clothing, [Lu Xiaoyu] suddenly appeared suspended in the air on stage. He rushed towards [Boss Cai], but got stuck in mid-air because the rope was too short.
1:27:27|1:27:32|The crew member handling the wire didn't control the strength well, causing [Lu Xiaoyu] to fall face down on the stage.
1:27:32|1:27:40|He rose with both hands on the ground, facing [Boss Cai] face to face, and the stage crew on both sides sensed the tension and hurriedly retreated from the stage.
1:27:53|1:27:57|Boss Cai looked towards Tom on the stage, and Tom nodded at him.
1:28:8|1:28:15|A large group of reporters below swarmed up, pointing their microphones and cameras at him.
1:29:17|1:29:26|Just now, Sister Mei, Li Jianguo, and Yong Jun, who were playing mahjong in the hospital room, have now appeared on the scene.
1:31:14|1:31:18|Seeing Lu Xiaoyu with a foreign aid, Boss Cai couldn't help but snort coldly. After the fish head was placed on the table,
1:31:18|1:31:24|[Lu Xiaoyu] is in a winning position, he knows he is no longer the same [Lu Xiaoyu] as before.
1:32:8|1:32:14|The small vendor is fighting with [Xiao Tian] again, [Lu Xiaoyu] looks at her own hands, and gently touches the palm of the other hand with one finger.
1:32:14|1:32:25|The pain quickly spread, and he finally realized that he had regained consciousness, then he tore off the necklace with a dollar sign on his neck. The shadow of the necklace was reflected on the wall.
1:32:27|1:32:31|The dollar sign is torn apart and split into a pair of chopsticks and the letter "s".
1:32:31|1:32:35|On stage, he wears the necklace and puts on the clothes given by [Xiao Man].
1:32:46|1:32:50|The scene was quiet, with only [Xiao Tian] shouting hoarsely in the audience, crazily cheering for [Lu Xiaoyu].
1:32:50|1:32:55|[Lu Xiaoyu] rolled up his sleeves and placed his hand on top of a fish head.
1:33:4|1:33:14|Jianguo and the others saw his actions and thought he was abnormal. [Lu Xiaoyu] reached for the last fish head, and [Tom] also found it unbelievable.
1:33:32|1:33:39|[Lu Xiaoyu] decided to use this fish head. He cut open the fish head, and the fish meat immediately emitted a dazzling light.
1:34:43|1:34:56|Boss Cai couldn't stop laughing in the audience, but the next scene made him immediately stop. A device was quickly assembled on stage, and the fish head was placed inside.
1:35:17|1:35:25|The fuse on the aircraft was ignited, and a large fire burst out from the bottom, followed by billowing smoke spreading out.
1:35:25|1:35:32|The aircraft broke through the glass of the venue and successfully flew the Fish Head King into the sky. Master [Tom]'s mixed stew hotpot is ready.
1:35:59|1:36:5|The aircraft suddenly landed, causing [Boss Cai]'s hair to be blown open, with smoke rising between the strands.
1:36:16|1:36:28|Tom's potluck brawl and Lu Xiaoyu's Seven Dragon Ball Fish Head King are officially served. The aroma of the two dishes spreads out, immersing the judges and the audience in the fragrance.
1:36:47|1:36:53|Mr. Dong's spoon left the Dragon Ball Fish Head King and turned to Tom's hotpot brawl, with the other two judges joining in the tasting.
1:37:15|1:37:36|Suddenly, there was a dramatic twist in the scene. The taste of the basin dish continued to fiercely suppress the aura of the Fish Head King. After several rounds of confrontation, the taste of the Fish Head King still couldn't revive, being overwhelmed by the taste of the basin dish. The once incredibly delicious Fish Head King now only tasted like dried fish.
1:37:42|1:37:51|The three judges mercilessly criticized the taste of the fish head king, and [Boss Cai] seemed to have succeeded in his scheme, a cunning smile appearing on his face.
1:37:56|1:38:7|The three judges were still enjoying the basin feast, a scene that caught [Tom] completely off guard. [Lu Xiaoyu] and others were very puzzled by this result.
1:38:7|1:38:14|Several people walked off the stage and tasted the flavor of the Fish Head King.
1:38:16|1:38:30|[Lu Xiaoyu] scooped up a spoonful of [Tom]'s dish and put it into his mouth. Instantly, he sensed something was wrong as his mouth was filled with the taste of chemical additives. [Boss Cai] leaned in close to his ear and whispered,
1:38:49|1:38:56|Boss Cai intentionally poured the hot water from the thermos on Lu Xiaoyu's arm.
1:39:19|1:39:37|[Xiao Man] pushed [Jerry] in a wheelchair to the press conference, but they were stopped by security guards at the door. Amidst the argument, she happened to see [Lu Xiaoyu], who was pushed into the kitchen by four people and locked behind a heavy iron door.
1:40:4|1:40:11|[Xiao Man] appeared at the scene holding some chili sauce at some point.
1:40:34|1:40:50|The scene shifts to the kitchen where [Lu Xiaoyu] is working. He is stirring chili sauce by hand, the pain from the chili on his skin making him sweat profusely. It also brings back memories of his childhood, when his mother used the same method to make chili sauce.
1:41:20|1:41:26|After the final baptism in hot oil, the chili sauce in the hands of the audience and judges was born.
1:42:27|1:42:33|The chili sauce godmother hidden in the audience stands up with a halo above her head, speaking earnestly.
1:44:21|1:44:29|Tom angrily flipped open the manual, only to find it filled with portraits of her and Jerry.
1:45:0|1:45:16|The USB drive actually contained pictures of Tom and Jerry. [Boss Cai] was taken away by the police, and the audience below applauded and cheered. [Xiao Man], [Li Jianguo], and others happily surrounded [Jerry] to celebrate.
1:45:16|1:45:26|Due to directly touching the chili peppers, [Lu Xiaoyu] couldn't hold on and eventually passed out. [Xiao Man] hurriedly ran towards him.
1:45:27|1:45:34|[Lu Xiaoyu] smiled. He thought [Xiao Man] would give him artificial respiration, but to his surprise, when he opened his eyes.
1:45:44|1:45:54|[Lu Xiaoyu] pushed aside [Xiao Tian], and [Li Jianguo] also joined in, pushing towards him. [Yong Jun] helped [Li Jianguo] grab [Lu Xiaoyu]'s hand, and [Xiao Man] couldn't rescue him. The stage was filled with joy and laughter, a scene of harmony and happiness.
1:46:8|1:46:14|[Xiao Man] pouted and leaned close to [Lu Xiaoyu], but [Lu Xiaoyu] winced and kept backing away.
