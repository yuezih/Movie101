0:0:32|0:0:52|The South Lake high-tech system slowly starts up, a series of complex information flows swiftly across the screen, gradually converging into a mysterious standalone icon. The symbol pauses for a moment before transforming into intricate data codes. At the same time, the positioning system begins to work, pinpointing the three main targets of this mission through satellite positioning.
0:0:52|0:0:57|They are the weapons room indoors, the command post, and the drug warehouse in the outskirts.
0:0:58|0:1:14|The support system for this mission is provided by Ambush Satellite One, located near the ancient path of Earth. The mission target is located on the southeastern border of Asia. This is a place surrounded by bio-mimetic omissions, and as the operational code is immediately emitted, the battle is about to begin.
0:1:14|0:1:16|At night, the sniper lay in ambush in the lush bushes.
0:1:32|0:1:44|Fingers pulled the trigger, the target on the rooftop fell down, and the team member below caught it steadily. Then they covered their tracks, lifted someone to kick against the wall, moved smoothly throughout the process, without making a sound.
0:1:44|0:1:54|The opener patrols with the military, and a team member reaches out from the grass, grabs his ankle, knocks him down, breaks his neck, then immediately raises the gun and signals to advance.
0:1:55|0:2:0|A sudden flight, followed by an eerie silence, then another guard is assassinated with a dagger.
0:2:0|0:2:6|The team members were like a gust of wind, appearing and disappearing without a trace, gradually infiltrating into the enemy's territory.
0:2:6|0:2:12|Outside the abandoned factory gate, the team gradually surrounded the entrance, with members closing in from both sides.
0:2:12|0:2:17|On the rooftop, the successful assault team member approached the ventilation opening and looked into the factory building by the moonlight.
0:2:18|0:2:28|Building debris is everywhere, the enemies are not gathered, either two or three people are distributed in different locations inside the factory.
0:2:28|0:2:42|In the room, the enemies are passing time by drinking and playing cards. The scout on the rooftop notices that the enemies inside are not very alert, so after observing for a while, they use a walkie-talkie to report the situation to their teammates outside.
0:2:44|0:2:50|Outside the door, the team members on standby heard the information coming through their earpieces, their eyes meeting each other.
0:2:50|0:2:58|One of the team members on the side quickly approached the gate upon seeing the signal, took out tactical explosives, and installed them on the gate.
0:2:58|0:3:3|After the explosives were set up, the team members immediately retreated to their original positions. The captain nodded in approval, and the explosives were then detonated.
0:3:5|0:3:12|Accompanied by a roar, flames rose, and the gate was violently pushed open by the shock wave, while the rooftop team members took the opportunity to throw smoke bombs.
0:3:12|0:3:17|Time is running out, and the team members waiting outside enter with the smoke.
0:3:17|0:3:25|The thugs had not reacted yet when the bullets had already pierced their bodies. The team members cooperated seamlessly, indicating that this was a well-trained team.
0:3:26|0:3:44|The firepower gradually suppressed the criminals, leaving only a few of them forced to huddle in the corner to fight back. The team members on the rooftop also took the opportunity to aim, their rifles acting like sniper rifles. One bullet, one enemy. Suddenly, a criminal hiding under the wooden planks emerged, picking up a rifle next to him to prepare to shoot. A team member spotted him just in time.
0:3:44|0:4:5|Immediately grab the gun and engage in hand-to-hand combat amidst the flying bullets. The thug's punch misses, and the team member immediately strikes with a powerful right fist, as heavy as a thunderbolt, sending the thug flying. The attack is not over yet, as the team member follows up with a flying kick, causing the thug to fall to the ground. While the thug is down, the team member pulls the trigger, executing a series of swift and deadly moves, effortlessly taking the opponent's life.
0:4:5|0:4:13|In the lull between gunshots, inside the warehouse, all the criminals were shot dead, yet the team members remained vigilant, and the leading captain walked towards the hostages on the ground.
0:4:21|0:4:47|The captain opened the walkie-talkie and reported the results of this mission. "Go ahead," the captain lifted the hostage, blending in with the surroundings where the team members were ambushed. Upon hearing the completion of the task, they immediately moved to withdraw. They leaped through the jungle, suddenly, the team member ahead raised his hand to signal a stop, holding up his gun in alert, both of them held their breath and focused.
0:4:48|0:4:54|At the same time, they rapidly observed their surroundings, as if a pair of invisible eyes were watching them.
0:4:54|0:4:59|In the nearby bushes, a sniper rifle is aiming at them, and a team member is patrolling and alert.
0:5:2|0:5:11|He pushed aside his teammate and took the bullet himself, falling to the ground. The enemy immediately retreated after firing, while the teammate who was pushed opened fire.
0:5:11|0:5:18|Two shots fired, the enemy ran far away using the terrain. He was unwilling to let the other party go, changed position, and continued shooting.
0:5:18|0:5:26|A shot fired, the bullet blocked by the trees. The second shot rang out, but the enemy had already disappeared, leaving the team members holding their guns in place.
0:5:27|0:5:37|The scene fades away, and the battle in the jungle comes to an end because of a sniper's secret shot, which resulted in his comrade [Ye Lei] getting injured and discharged.
0:5:37|0:5:43|After retiring, [Ye Lei] seemed to have disappeared completely. He changed his phone number and cut off all contact with his comrades.
0:5:44|0:6:4|When [Ye Feng] saw [Ye Lei] again, it was because of a murder case. A Japanese chemist was murdered while on vacation abroad, by a member of a drug trafficking gang who also kidnapped the chemist's female assistant. What is the purpose of the criminal group, and what is their connection to comrade [Ye Lei].
0:6:6|0:6:11|[Ye Feng] inadvertently discovers many secrets about [Ye Lei] while pursuing the truth.
0:6:11|0:6:21|Currently, [Ye Lei] appears to be the owner of a tea shop, but in reality, he has become a member of a drug trafficking gang, which sets the stage for the first highlight of this film.
0:6:39|0:6:47|Fortunately, as the plot unfolds, [Ye Lei] is not a criminal, but a secret undercover agent dispatched by the Chinese People's Police Force.
0:6:47|0:6:51|When facing danger and temptation, he still sticks to his original intention.
0:6:53|0:7:20|Accompanied by the unfolding of the metal curtain, the title "Sniper Moment" slowly appears in the center of the screen. Many years later, a military off-road vehicle is slowly driving, and a man in military uniform is returning to the army. Sometimes, a certain moment in life will be forever etched in our memory, never to be erased no matter how many years pass.
0:7:34|0:7:39|The scene flashes back to the moment when a teammate was hit, the memories in the jungle were vividly visible.
0:7:53|0:8:0|They are your comrades, and the man was stopped by soldiers at the military district gate.
0:8:14|0:8:16|[Ye Feng] is lost in memories.
0:8:29|0:8:34|Back at the military camp, [Ye Feng] opened the wooden box, inside of which were letters sent to [Ye Lei].
0:9:13|0:9:21|Memories flooded his mind as Ye Feng felt deeply distressed by Ye Lei's disappearance. He stood in the military camp in silence, his expression incredibly complex.
0:9:28|0:9:40|The nightmare woke [Ye Feng] up, memories of the jungle battle kept flashing in his mind. He stared at the ceiling with wide eyes, then quickly got up from the bed and walked out of the military camp.
0:9:40|0:9:47|The captain called out to [Ye Feng], waving his hand to signal [Ye Feng] to come over.
0:9:47|0:9:51|[Ye Feng], who received the order, walked through the rows of soldiers towards the captain.
0:9:51|0:9:55|He walked slowly to Captain Huang Shilong and saluted him with a standard military salute.
0:10:4|0:10:7|The captain's eyes began to dodge.
0:10:24|0:10:25|His eyes were determined.
0:10:26|0:10:29|The captain lowered his head and changed the subject.
0:10:42|0:10:49|[Ye Feng] raised his hand to salute the captain, then turned on the spot and walked away with a standard running posture.
0:10:49|0:11:3|The captain looked worried as he watched [Ye Feng] leave without saying a word. The next day, in the quiet jungle, armed soldiers broke the deadlock, and the exercise mentioned by the captain had begun.
0:11:3|0:11:10|The Wolf Fox Assault Team walks along the stream, with the team members looking tense and constantly checking the surroundings.
0:11:10|0:11:22|The leading [Ye Feng] led the team forward slowly, the enemies lurking in the silent jungle like a venomous snake ready to strike, the unknown danger making every step of the team members cautious.
0:11:23|0:11:29|After investigating the captain ahead, [Ye Feng] raised his right hand into a fist and signaled the team behind him to move forward.
0:11:29|0:11:37|Taking advantage of the cover of the nearby bushes, everyone quickly closed in on [Ye Feng], and at the same time, the sniper in the team also arrived by his side.
0:11:37|0:11:42|The captain pointed his left hand towards his eyes and his left arm backwards, signaling the sniper to take cover and observe.
0:11:43|0:11:50|They then led the team to continue moving forward, wading through the creek, stepping over dead trees, and advancing deeper into the jungle.
0:11:50|0:12:2|The sniper, dressed in a ghillie suit and covered in leaves, blends into the environment like casting an invisibility spell after finding a good sniping position. Without careful observation, his location is practically impossible to spot.
0:12:2|0:12:9|On the other side, the captain led the team members walking along the stream, the sound of the flowing water masking their footsteps.
0:12:11|0:12:18|The team members were clearly divided in their tasks, each covering the blind spots of their teammates, forming a comprehensive observation without any dead angles.
0:12:18|0:12:22|On the other side, the sniper observed the surroundings with a sniper rifle.
0:12:25|0:12:27|The next second, a gun emerges from behind the sniper.
0:12:29|0:12:38|The whistle sounded, and the sniper finally realized that someone was behind him. He turned around awkwardly, smiling, while the other person looked at him teasingly.
0:12:38|0:12:47|The sniper was captured silently, unable to assist teammates in observation and warning, leaving the enemy with a clear understanding of their positions.
0:12:47|0:12:52|The front team members are still advancing, with the machine gunner holding a light machine gun at the rear of the team.
0:12:53|0:13:6|It's close to noon, the sunlight is shining directly into the woods, casting broken shadows of the plants. The [Huang Shilong] assault team has not yet detected the approaching enemy, and the distance between the two sides is getting closer.
0:13:6|0:13:13|Crossing the stream, the team arrived at the rugged uphill section, where the terrain was complex and once engaged in battle, it would be very difficult to retreat.
0:13:14|0:13:33|Under the big tree on the side, the enemy is observing the assault team members. Taking advantage of the cover provided by the auspicious Fu, the enemy swiftly shuttles through the woods. He carefully observes the surroundings, somewhat resembling [Huang Shilong] who is advancing with the assault team up the mountain. Upon closer inspection, it turns out that this person was the one who had just taken out the sniper in the team.
0:13:33|0:13:39|At this moment, he no longer had the arrogance and sarcasm he had before, every move seemed particularly cautious.
0:13:39|0:13:47|He found a vantage point, hid himself, raised his gun, aimed, and quietly waited for the opportunity to strike against the assault team led by [Huang Shilong].
0:13:47|0:13:58|A team member was immediately eliminated, the machine gunner fired wildly at the shooting position, unaware that the enemy had already changed positions.
0:13:58|0:14:3|The captain and a team member escaped and ran frantically towards the destination.
0:14:3|0:14:15|The sniper who had long been lying in wait took out the team leader with one shot, then switched sniper rifles. Smoke rose behind [Huang Shilong] and the other, signaling the failure of this mission.
0:14:15|0:14:19|In the end, they still didn't find the sniper's location.
0:14:19|0:14:25|The sniper who completed the mission emerged from the ambush point, and only then did the captain see the enemy's position.
0:14:25|0:14:28|Ye Feng slid down the hill and arrived in front of the two men.
0:14:28|0:14:30|He carried a sniper rifle on his shoulder, looking very arrogant.
0:14:32|0:14:39|Passing by the two, he deliberately struck the other with the butt of his gun, showing complete disregard for the Blue Tiger Team.
0:14:39|0:14:46|Three people slowly arrived at the finish line, with the captain and the previously eliminated members of the assault team waiting in place.
0:14:46|0:14:51|Sniper [Ye Feng] took the lead, flashing a dazzling smile at the captain.
0:14:51|0:14:55|Captain Ye Feng didn't respond, he turned his head and walked away with a cold face.
0:14:55|0:15:0|In this military exercise, the entire team was wiped out, and it was done by one person.
0:15:1|0:15:7|Everyone looked a bit embarrassed as, led by the team leader, they left the training ground one by one.
0:15:7|0:15:16|Sniper [Ye Feng] watched the Blue Lake Assault Team leave, and when he realized that no one paid attention to him, he immediately retracted his gun and ran forward to catch up with the team.
0:15:19|0:15:25|The scene shifts, the tranquil lake is like a mirror, reflecting the sky and the mountains.
0:15:25|0:15:30|This is Dongla, a border city in Southeast Asia's country K.
0:15:30|0:15:35|A woman with an outstanding figure, wearing headphones, is dancing slowly to the music.
0:15:35|0:15:39|The villa on the small island reveals the extraordinary status of the owner here.
0:15:41|0:16:4|On the balcony of the villa, the woman is still immersed in the singing, swaying her waist. Behind her, a transaction is taking place. The man inspecting the goods is looking at an ancient map. After confirming its accuracy, he pushes the box containing a large sum of cash to the other party. The woman then turns and walks towards the one receiving the money after the transaction is completed.
0:16:13|0:16:20|The opponent did not show any alertness towards the woman, instead, he turned around and played with his female companion.
0:16:20|0:16:30|The woman suddenly pushed the man, who was killed by the glass on the coffee table. She grabbed her female companion's hair with her left hand, held a box of money with her right hand, and slowly left the scene.
0:16:31|0:16:34|The incident was reported by television stations in China.
0:16:34|0:16:35|News from within the country of K.
0:16:44|0:16:45|The whereabouts of the murderer are unknown.
0:16:46|0:16:52|The man in front of the TV saw the news, clasped his hands together, furrowed his brow, as if pondering something.
0:16:52|0:16:59|The scene shifts to a teahouse, where the female waitress skillfully washes and pours tea.
0:16:59|0:17:9|A man with a crew cut enters, walking through the corridor and glancing at the tea artist brewing tea. He then walks up to the boss's desk, picks up two boxes of cigarettes on the desk.
0:17:10|0:17:12|Left after putting it in the jacket pocket.
0:17:12|0:17:26|The female tea doctor stared at his departing figure without saying a word throughout, and the man with a crew cut also looked quite chic. The customers in the shop did not affect his movements at all. He took big strides forward and slowly left the place.
0:17:26|0:17:34|On the other side, in the unit that finished the exercise, the [Ye Feng] assault team is being questioned by the captain.
0:17:34|0:17:37|Captain Ye Feng slowly took off his sunglasses and continued to question.
0:17:52|0:17:58|The captain stared fiercely at the sniper of the squad.
0:17:58|0:18:2|The captain then left.
0:18:2|0:18:7|In the line of soldiers standing at attention, the machine gunner's stature was particularly burly, catching the attention of the captain.
0:18:33|0:18:37|Facing the captain's questioning, [Wang Chao] lowered his head.
0:18:37|0:18:39|Captain Ye Feng's tone became increasingly stern.
0:19:10|0:19:18|The assault team tightens their bodies.
0:19:18|0:19:25|As the members of the Blue Lake Assault Team ran away, Captain Ye Feng slowly put on his sunglasses and regained his former coldness.
0:19:25|0:19:43|On the other side, the wide and empty road was deserted, with no vehicles in sight. A jeep raced along the road, and as the camera slowly pulled back, the surrounding scenery had already left the bustling city far behind. The jeep was heading towards the mountainous area covered with trees.
0:19:45|0:19:52|After leaving the highway, the jeep continued to climb along the mountain road, with trees lining both sides of the road, creating a tranquil atmosphere.
0:19:52|0:20:0|The vehicle kept moving without stopping, raising clouds of dust as the rear wheels rolled over the ground, shining brightly under the sunlight.
0:20:0|0:20:2|The man slowly stopped the car and then pulled up the handbrake.
0:20:4|0:20:8|Ye Feng then unbuckles the seatbelt, opens the car door, and gets out.
0:20:8|0:20:14|The man felt a bit tired after the long journey, he stretched his neck and then walked towards the gate.
0:20:14|0:20:23|The main gate leads directly to the courtyard. There is a couplet at the entrance, the characters on it have faded a bit. The man glanced at the little brother guarding the entrance and walked in.
0:20:25|0:20:32|The man turned out to be the long-lost [Ye Lei], he threw a stack of banknotes to his younger brother and walked towards the depths of the courtyard.
0:20:32|0:20:37|The courtyard is very quiet, with guards visible everywhere, indicating that this place is not simple.
0:20:37|0:20:44|[Ye Lei] walked through the corridor and arrived at the door. He pushed it open and saw his elder brother [Valang] brewing tea.
0:20:47|0:20:50|[Ye Lei] quickly took a seat after listening and accepted the tea handed to him by his elder brother.
0:20:52|0:20:56|The elder brother savored the tea fragrance, then finished the tea in his cup in one gulp.
0:20:56|0:20:58|[Ye Lei] also started sipping from the small cup.
0:21:11|0:21:12|[Ye Lei] smiled without saying a word.
0:21:30|0:21:34|[Ye Lei] watched as his big brother walked away, his simple and honest smile gradually disappearing.
0:21:34|0:21:42|Soon after, he picked up the teapot and poured tea into the cup. His pouring hand was steady, but the tea splashed out of the cup and landed on the table.
0:21:48|0:21:50|The big brother took out a tablet.
0:21:51|0:21:52|[Ye Lei] was very surprised when he saw it.
0:22:18|0:22:23|[Ye Lei]'s proposal was rejected by his older brother, he lowered his head and never spoke again.
0:22:23|0:22:29|In the military camp, [Ye Feng] is tidying up his military cap as his teammate walks up behind him.
0:22:29|0:22:32|[Ye Feng] didn't look back, his eyes flickering slightly.
0:22:35|0:22:37|[Ye Feng] puts the hat on the blanket.
0:22:39|0:22:42|[Ye Feng] heard the words, turned back to look, and the other person turned their head to avoid eye contact.
0:22:45|0:22:46|Ye Feng asked persistently.
0:22:54|0:22:59|Comrades tried to take advantage and grab the gloves, but ended up empty-handed.
0:23:4|0:23:6|Another comrade came in and spoke.
0:23:7|0:23:16|Originally, they were all members of the Blue Lake Assault Team. It seems that [Ye Feng] had wiped them out before, causing the team to lose face. Now they are ready to reclaim their reputation.
0:23:16|0:23:29|[Ye Feng] followed them to the camp dormitory. As soon as he entered, some team members surrounded him. Despite being blocked from behind, [Ye Feng] did not show any fear. Facing the aggressive group, [Ye Feng] displayed his extraordinary courage.
0:23:52|0:24:1|Everyone's acting successfully fooled [Ye Feng] earlier. It turns out it was a surprise they prepared for him, pretending to be serious was just a little joke.
0:24:1|0:24:5|[Ye Feng] embraces his comrades, and their relationship is instantly restored to its original state.
0:24:10|0:24:14|In the scene, [Ye Lei] is currently fighting on the rooftop balcony.
0:24:14|0:24:19|He is bare-chested, with a focused expression, and his bulging muscles are clearly visible.
0:24:19|0:24:24|Whether throwing punches or kicking, every move of his is filled with astonishing explosive power.
0:24:24|0:24:30|A young woman walked up to the rooftop, silently watching [Ye Lei] exercising from behind.
0:24:30|0:24:35|Report, the scene cuts to [Ye Feng] entering the tent where the captain is located.
0:24:47|0:24:49|[Ye Feng] did not move after hearing it.
0:24:59|0:25:2|The captain slammed the table and stood up.
0:25:8|0:25:27|[Ye Feng] remained silent after hearing, but the captain knew well the reason he wanted to be alone, so he slowly approached [Ye Feng], gazing into his eyes, and continued speaking.
0:25:27|0:25:28|[Ye Feng] eyes were red.
0:25:31|0:25:32|He shouted loudly.
0:25:32|0:25:35|It seems as if he is venting the emotions hidden deep in his heart.
0:25:35|0:25:46|On the training ground, soldiers are engaged in intense drills. Some are rock climbing without equipment, some are practicing crawling forward, and others are undergoing running training.
0:25:54|0:25:57|[Yang Ji] is conducting sniper training on the shooting range.
0:25:57|0:26:4|A shot fired, the bullet deviated from the bullseye and landed on a distant hillside.
0:26:4|0:26:9|Another shot fired, but the bullet still missed the target.
0:26:9|0:26:11|[Ye Feng], who approached quietly, proposed an adjustment plan.
0:26:11|0:26:17|[Yang Ji] hesitated for a moment after hearing it, but still followed through with the adjustments.
0:26:17|0:26:19|The bullet hit the 9-ring, and [Ye Feng] nodded.
0:26:21|0:26:23|[Ye Feng] applauds to show approval.
0:26:23|0:26:29|[Yang Ji] put down the gun, stood up, and stood shoulder to shoulder with [Ye Feng], but said nothing.
0:26:52|0:27:0|[Yang Ji] turned his head to look at [Ye Feng], his thick black eyebrows furrowed together as if pondering something.
0:27:0|0:27:4|His eyes lowered, he pursed his lips, turned his head and smiled.
0:27:10|0:27:20|[Ye Feng] smiled and looked at [Yang Ji], who had his back to him. He slowly took off his gloves and handed them to the other person's mouth, shaking them.
0:27:23|0:27:30|Yang Ji was amused by Ye Feng's actions, but still refused to accept his gloves, and the two of them engaged in a playful back-and-forth.
0:27:30|0:27:34|Finally, [Ye Feng] got angry and slapped the gloves on Yang Ji's head.
0:27:39|0:27:43|[Ye Feng] handed the gloves to Yang Ji and then ran off with a smile.
0:27:45|0:27:50|The scene shifts to the street, where an old-fashioned Volkswagen taxi is slowly approaching.
0:27:50|0:27:57|The taxi turned right and slowly pulled over to the side of the road. After the car stopped, the door opened.
0:27:57|0:28:2|[Ye Feng], dressed in a leather jacket, slowly gets out of the back seat.
0:28:2|0:28:8|Since getting off the car, he has been staring into the distance, not even bothering to ask for the taxi fare from the driver.
0:28:8|0:28:12|He stood at the intersection for a while, then walked into the street.
0:28:42|0:28:47|At the prompting of the tea artist, [Ye Feng] hesitated for a moment before picking up the cup.
0:28:47|0:28:51|The female tea artist then turned around to fetch the kettle behind her.
0:29:1|0:29:5|[Ye Feng] was shocked to hear this, his eyes fixed firmly on the tea master.
0:29:5|0:29:10|His eyes flickered slightly, then he drank the tea at the corner of his mouth.
0:29:14|0:29:38|Outside the door, [Ye Lei], who was about to make a call back, saw [Ye Feng] inside the house and immediately concealed himself to retreat. At this moment, [Ye Feng] also finished his conversation with Cha Yishi and got up to leave. Cha Yishi did not stop him, but stared in the direction [Ye Feng] was leaving. The previous friendliness and smile gradually disappeared from his face, and the scene gradually faded away. The investigated [Ye Feng] sat in the car heading back to the troops.
0:29:47|0:29:52|The scenery around them quickly passed by as [Ye Feng] sat in silence in the passenger seat.
0:29:52|0:30:2|By the beautiful lake, a woman is leaning on the railing, gazing at the scenery, with seabirds circling around, as picturesque as a painting.
0:30:2|0:30:6|[Ye Lei] walked slowly over and stopped beside the woman.
0:30:26|0:30:31|The woman turned out to be the tea artist in the Night Thunder Palace, named Xiao Lu.
0:30:31|0:30:33|Ye Feng continues to feed the seabirds.
0:30:48|0:30:54|[Ye Lu] suddenly turned his head after hearing it, staring intently at [Ye Lei].
0:30:54|0:31:0|He looked at [Ye Lei], his eyes gradually lowering.
0:31:0|0:31:4|After listening to Ye Lei's words, Xiao Lu turned his head away, seeming unwilling to answer the question.
0:31:6|0:31:24|The scene shifts to a hilltop where a jeep slowly approaches. The members of Ping 81 gang waiting on the hill leave the car to greet them on the street. Ye Feng's elder brother Huang Shilong steps out of the jeep and embraces the members of Ping 81 gang before speaking.
0:31:33|0:31:38|While the two were talking, a Mitsubishi Jeep raced past.
0:31:38|0:31:43|Through the car window, seeing [Huang Shilong] and Ping Ba, the jeep immediately reversed to adjust its direction.
0:31:43|0:31:48|After stopping the car, the four members of the Unarmed Team walked towards the other side.
0:31:48|0:31:56|The unarmed team is fully armed, with gun holsters placed at the waist in three directions, facing [Huang Shilong] and [Ping Ba], the unarmed team maintains a high level of vigilance.
0:31:58|0:32:4|Ping Ba's henchman had just taken out the pistol hidden behind his back when he was stopped by the boss and returned to his original state.
0:32:4|0:32:8|The armed police squad began a routine inspection.
0:32:8|0:32:15|[Huang Shilong] stared at the armed police, slowly reached into his pants pocket with his right hand, and took out his ID to hand it over.
0:32:15|0:32:19|The armed police officer took the ID card, compared it, confirmed it was correct, then turned to look at [Ping Ba].
0:32:21|0:32:28|Pingba turned his head to signal his younger brother, but at this moment, the trunk of the car made a noise.
0:32:29|0:32:32|Pingba remained indifferent, and the armed police immediately drew their guns.
0:32:35|0:32:42|Pan Ba walked helplessly towards the trunk, while a sniper rifle aimed at them from a distance, the sniper adjusting the scope.
0:32:44|0:32:53|After checking the sniper rifle, [Ping Ba] and others had already reached the rear of the car. He reluctantly opened the trunk, as if trying to delay the time.
0:32:53|0:33:13|The trunk slowly opens, revealing a woman with her limbs bound and mouth gagged. The armed police officers are stunned by this sight. A sniper in the distance fires a shot, killing the closest officer to the trunk. [Ye Feng]'s men hear the gunshot and immediately spring into action, engaging in combat with the other officers. Another officer is shot by the sniper.
0:33:13|0:33:16|At this moment, there are only two armed police officers left on the field.
0:33:16|0:33:30|Valan also joined the battle, disrupting a SWAT member who was about to support his teammate. The sniper was forced to leave quickly, and as his teammate was hit, he fell to the ground. The last SWAT member also fell to the ground and couldn't get up. The fallen SWAT member fiercely grabbed Valan's pants leg.
0:33:34|0:33:52|Seeing this scene, [Ping Ba] cautiously approached with a gun in hand, aiming at the head of [Walang]. [Walang] coldly stared back at him, then with two quick movements, he pushed away the opponent's gun with his left hand and grabbed it with his right hand. Without hesitation, he pulled the trigger at the fallen armed police officer.
0:33:52|0:34:12|After all this, [Walang] returned the pistol to [Pingba], and the sudden trust crisis between the two gradually eased after the scene just now. The picture gradually faded away. In [Ye Lei]'s room, Xiao Lu knocked on the door and entered. [Ye Lei] quickly put down the water glass and hid the clothes beside him.
0:34:18|0:34:22|The exquisite tea box is placed on the table, Xiao Lu smiles with narrowed eyes.
0:34:25|0:34:29|Xiao Lu was somewhat frustrated.
0:34:31|0:34:41|[Ye Lei] nodded in agreement. Xiao Lu's enthusiasm was futile against this man with a determined face. Xiao Lu could only helplessly turn around and leave.
0:34:41|0:34:49|[Ye Lei] looked in the direction the other person left, then turned his head to contemplate, as if he had many things on his mind. He took a sip and drank the water in the cup.
0:34:51|0:34:57|On the other side, after the battle ended, Pingba brought the woman from the trunk to a wooden house.
0:34:57|0:35:6|In a room without lights, he walked deep inside until he reached the innermost room where the woman was rudely thrown on the ground. His face was full of fear as he looked around.
0:35:6|0:35:10|Ping Ba walked into the room and sat down next to his big brother Mujin.
0:35:32|0:35:46|On the other side, [Ye Lei] drove to the front of the tea shop, where Xiao Lu was seeing off the guests.
0:36:10|0:36:16|He turned around to close the shop door, while [Ye Lei] stared closely at his departing figure, seemingly pondering something.
0:36:18|0:36:32|Upon the arrival of dusk, under the moonlit willow branches, [Ye Feng]'s car stopped in front of a restaurant with distinctive ethnic characteristics. The attic-style building was in Chinese architectural style, and the large lanterns at the entrance left a deep impression. The two got out of the car and walked into the restaurant.
0:36:35|0:36:50|The time was already late, yet there were still scattered customers dining here. Along with the dim light above each table, the steaming hot food, and the distinctive large lanterns, a sharp contrast was formed with the already dark surroundings.
0:36:50|0:36:57|[Ye Lei] and Xiao Lu climbed the wooden stairs to the second floor and found a place to sit down.
0:36:59|0:37:6|Ye Feng and Huang Shilong sat facing each other. Ye Feng picked up the water kettle on the table and poured tea into Xiao Lu's cup.
0:37:6|0:37:12|The dishes were served, looking very tempting, and Xiao Lu kept picking up food with her chopsticks and eating rice.
0:37:12|0:37:19|[Ye Feng] did not eat, freeing his hands to release the chopsticks, letting them collide with the table, making a rhythmic sound.
0:37:30|0:37:35|Xiao Lu looked a little puzzled when she saw this scene. She stopped eating and asked [Ye Feng].
0:37:38|0:37:41|Xiao Lu stopped and revealed a lovely smile.
0:37:44|0:37:50|Xiao Lu's eyes and eyebrows drooped, giving her a somewhat playful girl's appearance, and shyness was vivid on her face.
0:38:3|0:38:5|Xiao Lu asked with a smile.
0:38:10|0:38:19|[Ye Feng] frowned upon hearing this, and the Alliance showed off on her clothes. Xiao Lu was amused by her simple and honest gesture.
0:38:19|0:38:21|At this moment, a text message shattered the harmony.
0:38:22|0:38:27|[Ye Lei] picked up the phone and unlocked it, only to find a message from his big brother.
0:38:27|0:38:31|Xiao Lu saw the other person staring at the phone, with no change in expression.
0:38:31|0:38:36|The unlocked phone shows the time as 11:51 PM.
0:38:36|0:38:40|[Ye Lei] quietly deleted the text message sent by his big brother a minute ago.
0:38:44|0:38:56|[Ye Lei] got up and left, while Xiao Lu stared at his back closely. As soon as his figure disappeared at the staircase, Xiao Lu immediately picked up [Ye Lei]'s phone and then opened his own backpack.
0:38:56|0:39:4|Xiao Lu searched in the bag and took out an electronic device, then inserted it into [Ye Lei]'s phone, and the screen showed data being copied.
0:39:5|0:39:11|Originally, the information on Ye Lei's phone was quickly transferred and copied to Xiao Lu's device.
0:39:11|0:39:17|Xiao Lu occasionally glanced at the stairs, alert for the sudden return of [Ye Lei].
0:39:17|0:39:21|Once the data copying was complete, Xiao Lu immediately put the phone back in its original position.
0:39:21|0:39:26|And at this moment, [Ye Lei] had just finished using the restroom and was walking up the stairs.
0:39:26|0:39:28|[Ye Lei] stepped forward and looked at [Xiao Lu], asking.
0:39:31|0:39:34|A phone call came in, and the smile on [Ye Lei]'s face disappeared.
0:39:34|0:39:40|[Ye Lei] picked up her phone from the table and looked at the incoming call from her big brother, instinctively wanting to answer it.
0:39:40|0:39:43|After hesitating for a moment, [Huang Shilong] hung up the phone.
0:39:49|0:39:53|[Ye Lei] finished speaking, turned around and left, starting a conversation with his older brother.
0:39:53|0:39:59|[Xiao Lu] looked at the other party, her expression slowly changing from gentle to cold, as if she had become a different person.
0:39:59|0:40:1|The scene shifts to the military camp.
0:40:32|0:40:33|The meeting is still in progress.
0:40:36|0:40:49|On the other side, in the cabin where [Colonel Magnolia Lock] is located, a woman wearing high-heeled leather boots walks in. She walks towards the girl Xiaomei who was previously locked in the trunk.
0:41:8|0:41:13|[Kana] whispered in his ear, then he gently touched Xiaomei's face with his hand.
0:41:13|0:41:19|Xiao Mei shrank back in fear from his touch, with an indescribable look of terror in her eyes.
0:41:19|0:41:25|On the street, a car slowly stopped by the roadside, and when the window rolled down, it was [Kana] wearing sunglasses.
0:41:25|0:41:30|He took off his sunglasses and looked across the road, only to find that it was the teahouse run by [Ye Lei].
0:41:31|0:41:50|Investigator Xiao Lu, played by [Kana], is packing up outside the shop, making sure the other party hasn't noticed. [Kana] picks up the camera placed on the passenger seat, aims the lens at Xiao Lu, and clicks the shutter button. One, two, three shots, he keeps shooting, capturing every move of Xiao Lu in the camera.
0:41:50|0:42:4|After confirming that the opponent's appearance was clearly captured, [Kana] retrieved the camera, drove away, and then he arrived at the wooden house where Mugun was located. The interior of the house was extremely dim, illuminated only by the light passing through the glass.
0:42:4|0:42:9|Mujin walked out of the room, dressed in camouflage military uniform, making herself look like a soldier.
0:42:28|0:42:32|The scene cuts back to the teahouse, with a phone vibrating on the table.
0:42:32|0:42:38|Xiao Lu picked up the phone, glanced at the incoming call information, and then handed the phone to [Ye Lei] next to her.
0:42:38|0:42:46|[Ye Lei] took the phone, glanced at the smiling Lu who had turned away, and then answered the call.
0:42:50|0:42:57|After hanging up the phone, [Ye Lei] furrowed his brows in thought and then turned around to walk towards Xiao Lu.
0:42:57|0:42:59|Xiao Lu smiled at her.
0:43:1|0:43:4|The box opens, revealing a belt.
0:43:6|0:43:12|Xiao Lu smiled and put the gift box aside, then reached out with both hands towards [Ye Lei]'s waist.
0:43:12|0:43:17|[Ye Lei] was completely confused by this sudden move, looking at Xiao Lu in disbelief.
0:43:43|0:43:46|[Ye Lei] nodded with a smile after listening.
0:43:46|0:43:50|At this moment, the belt around the waist has quietly been changed.
0:43:52|0:43:53|[Ye Lei] was stopped by Xiao Lu.
0:43:55|0:43:58|Xiao Lu took a step towards him.
0:44:2|0:44:6|[Ye Lei] nodded, indicating the other party to continue speaking.
0:44:8|0:44:12|[Ye Lei] turned his head after listening, looked out the window, and said to [Xiao Lu] with his back turned.
0:44:18|0:44:23|After Xiao Lu finished speaking, Ye Feng looked complicated and glanced down at the ground.
0:44:30|0:44:35|Xiao Lu's words revealed her speculation about Ye Lei's identity.
0:44:35|0:44:39|[Ye Lei] was very surprised when she heard this, she turned her head to look at him.
0:44:39|0:44:42|[Xiao Lu] met [Ye Lei]'s gaze, and the two of them locked eyes.
0:44:42|0:44:46|[Ye Lei] said nothing, chuckled softly, and then turned and walked away.
0:44:46|0:44:52|[Xiao Lu] took a step forward, wanting to hold back, but just as the thought arose, she remembered [Ye Lei]'s toughness.
0:44:55|0:44:58|In another side, inside the military conference room.
0:45:15|0:45:16|One year later,
0:45:25|0:45:27|Another photo appears.
0:45:27|0:45:28|The leader looks at [Captain].
0:46:17|0:46:21|The soldiers observed and located the target through the screen before beginning their infiltration.
0:46:21|0:46:26|In the quiet jungle, the member of the Blue Fox commando team, wearing camouflage uniforms, is moving rapidly.
0:46:27|0:46:35|They passed through the complex terrain of the jungle, with team members close to each other to respond promptly to unexpected situations.
0:46:35|0:46:47|They arrived at a tea plantation, where the pathways on both sides of the tea trees and the leaves provided them with natural cover. They slowly climbed up the hillside, blending their clothes with nature.
0:46:47|0:47:1|Upon reaching the destination, the leading captain suddenly stopped and waited for further instructions. In the heavily guarded command vehicle not far away, [Captain Ye] was assigning tasks.
0:47:1|0:47:10|On the other side, [Wang Chao] finished the meeting, walked out of the quaint courtyard, and the pre-arranged [Blue Fox] assault team had already taken their positions.
0:47:10|0:47:14|Sniper [Ye Feng] reports to his teammates after observing the situation.
0:47:17|0:47:20|[Ye Feng] discovered a new situation.
0:47:30|0:47:34|The obscured figure turned his head, and [Ye Feng]'s profile appeared in the scope.
0:47:38|0:48:7|[Ye Feng] saw that [Ye Lei] was a bit distracted, understanding that he immediately adjusted his focus back to the sniper scope and began to wait. Ping Ba exposed a flaw, the soldier in [Ye Feng] suppressed his emotions. However, [Ye Feng] appeared to be in great pain at this moment. Suddenly, [Ye Lei] left, presenting a rare opportunity for Ping Ba, but [Ye Feng] did not give up. He held his breath, waited for the right moment, found a good position, and then fired a shot. Ping Ba was sniped by [Ye Feng].
0:48:14|0:48:19|At the military camp shooting range, the bullets steadily pierced through the stone rings.
0:48:19|0:48:23|Ye Feng, who has completed the mission, is practicing with a spear.
0:48:23|0:48:30|At this moment, [Ye Feng] appeared preoccupied, as if [Ye Lei] had appeared by his side in a trance.
0:48:30|0:48:33|A shot fired, a smile bloomed on [Ye Lei]'s face.
0:48:35|0:48:46|The scene just now was just a sudden awakening memory of [Ye Feng]. He looked at the empty space beside him, [Ye Lei] did not appear, but appeared in his scope not long ago.
0:48:46|0:48:54|[Ye Feng] couldn't make sense of it all, so he could only rely on practicing his spear to temporarily suppress his inner emotions.
0:48:54|0:49:1|At this moment, Captain Huang Shilong walked slowly from behind. Ye Feng heard the footsteps and immediately put down the sniper rifle, standing up to salute the captain.
0:49:3|0:49:10|[Ye Feng] locked eyes with the captain, then suddenly smiled. The appearance of [Ye Lei] completely threw his heart into chaos.
0:49:25|0:49:28|Captain Ye Feng turned his head after listening.
0:49:28|0:49:31|Just five hours ago.
0:49:33|0:49:39|He suddenly appeared in front of us, to be precise.
0:49:43|0:49:46|[Ye Feng]’s expression changed, and he sternly questioned the captain.
0:49:47|0:49:51|The captain remained silent, [Ye Feng] took a step forward and continued to ask.
0:50:3|0:50:6|Ye Feng's tone gradually changed.
0:50:13|0:50:19|The captain slowly took off his sunglasses, his eyes fixed on [Ye Feng] with a puzzled and intense gaze.
0:50:19|0:50:24|He took a deep breath, his mouth slightly downturned, revealing a disappointed expression.
0:50:24|0:50:29|Ye Feng stood still in place dumbfounded as Yi Yan walked away without saying a word.
0:50:29|0:50:35|He, who did not get the answer, felt extremely lost in his heart, and time passed little by little like this.
0:50:35|0:50:38|As the sun sets in the west, the soldiers on the training ground return to the barracks.
0:51:5|0:51:9|Six fighter jets flew overhead and raced towards the sunset.
0:51:9|0:51:15|The high-speed flying wake draws six beautiful straight lines in the air.
0:51:15|0:51:20|[Yang Ji] took out a harmonica from his pocket, looked at the scenery in front of him, and started playing it absentmindedly.
0:51:36|0:51:41|In an abandoned factory, a car drives in, breaking the bottleneck here.
0:51:41|0:51:47|The car suddenly stopped, with Kana sitting in the driver's seat and the hostage Xiaomei sitting in the passenger seat.
0:51:47|0:51:54|Xiao Mei gets out of the car and Kana follows closely behind. They arrive at a huge cylindrical machine lying horizontally.
0:51:54|0:52:0|The mechanical structure is densely covered with screws the size of fists, resembling an enlarged version of a wolf's fang club.
0:52:1|0:52:14|Xiao Mei led the way through the bottom, and they arrived at a location. They lifted the covering wooden board, and then, a small underground space appeared, inside which was a square box covered in dust for a long time.
0:52:14|0:52:21|Seeing the task completed, Kana patted Xiao Mei's shoulder and gently slid his right hand across Xiao Mei's neck.
0:52:21|0:52:28|Following that, a pale wound suddenly appeared, Xiao Mei and Ming fell into the underground space just now.
0:52:30|0:52:37|On the other side, [Ye Lei] opened a drawer and placed a mechanical device on the belt given to her earlier.
0:52:37|0:52:50|[Ye Lei] is wearing a V-neck long-sleeved shirt, her prominent muscles stretching the entire garment. Her determined face is furrowed with brows as she looks at the belt in front of her in silence, seemingly recalling the girl who gave her this gift.
0:52:52|0:53:1|The scene shifts, [Ye Lei] follows his elder brother [Walang] to the small wooden house where Mujin is located. There are guards at the door, all armed with real guns.
0:53:1|0:53:5|As the two were about to enter the door, the guard stopped them.
0:53:5|0:53:12|Valan glanced at Ye Lei behind him, indicating that he would go in alone, while Ye Lei waited at the door.
0:53:15|0:53:17|The guard kicked out, [Walang] knelt on the ground.
0:53:27|0:53:29|The pistol is pressed against Huang Shilong's head.
0:53:33|0:53:36|Mujin faces the window with his back to [Valan] and the guards.
0:53:36|0:53:38|After a moment of silence, [Ye Feng] spoke.
0:53:47|0:53:51|In the military conference room, a photo of Kana appears.
0:53:54|0:53:59|Former world shooting champion, now working as a bodyguard for [Ye Feng].
0:54:11|0:54:13|Captain Ye Feng nodded in agreement after hearing this.
0:54:13|0:54:19|The sun rose, and as the day was breaking, [Tian Hai] was already up, assuming a posture to start practicing.
0:54:19|0:54:24|In the dormitory, [Yang Ji] suddenly woke up and looked at his energetic roommate with a somewhat helpless expression.
0:54:28|0:54:36|After speaking, [Yang Ji] lifted the blanket and returned to the bed. Just as he lay down, [Tian Hai] remained indifferent.
0:54:36|0:54:45|[Yang Ji] reluctantly got up again.
0:54:45|0:54:49|[Yang Ji] took out a harmonica and played it leisurely in the cramped dormitory.
0:55:12|0:55:17|After the practice, [Tian Hai] performed the finishing move, and the sound of the zither slowly started to play again.
0:55:33|0:56:2|Xiao Lu, who changed into casual clothes in the mall, looked around before walking into a women's clothing store. The business in the store was very quiet, with only a few customers. Xiao Lu bypassed the shop assistant and looked with interest at the clothes in front of her. She then walked to another shelf and began to pick out clothes. Inadvertently, she turned her head and met the gaze of another female customer who was also selecting clothes behind her. In that moment of eye contact, both of them quickly looked away and continued to choose clothes.
0:56:4|0:56:14|Xiao Lu picked up a Niz coat from the shelf and walked towards the changing room, meeting the gaze of a customer once again.
0:56:14|0:56:21|Entering the dressing room, [Xiao Lu] did not try on clothes, but instead opened the leather bag that copied the one [Ye Lei] used for his phone.
0:56:21|0:56:29|Outside the dressing room, the female customer did not leave. At this moment, [Xiao Lu] opened the door of the dressing room, glanced at the other party, and then left quietly.
0:56:30|0:56:33|The coat inside still hangs on the wall intact.
0:56:33|0:56:39|The female customer casually picked up a dress and walked into the fitting room she had just been in.
0:56:39|0:56:48|[Xiao Lu] walked out of the clothing store and headed to the right, while the customer followed her closely and went in the completely opposite direction of [Xiao Lu]'s route.
0:56:48|0:57:1|At this moment, [Kana] in a leather jacket appeared. She was holding a newly bought drink, glanced in the direction the female customer left, and continued to follow not far behind [Xiao Lu], keeping a close watch.
0:57:1|0:57:6|[Xiao Lu] was unaware that someone was following behind her, walking on her own.
0:57:6|0:57:10|The two of them appeared very ordinary in the bustling crowd.
0:57:10|0:57:18|Suddenly, a pair of movers blocked Ye Feng's path, carrying a huge mirror that was facing Ye Feng directly.
0:57:18|0:57:28|So, [Xiao Lu] saw [Kana] not far behind her, then without saying a word, she made a sharp turn around the mirror and hid in the team of porters.
0:57:28|0:57:33|Kana was looking at her phone when she looked up and realized that [Xiao Lu] had disappeared without a trace.
0:57:34|0:57:40|Kana stood at the disappearing path, looking around anxiously.
0:57:40|0:57:43|Once he determined a direction, he started running.
0:57:43|0:57:47|Hard work pays off, and Kana has caught up with [Xiaolu] again.
0:57:47|0:57:55|He watched as [Xiaolu] walked out of the mall. This time, to prevent losing track, the distance between them seemed to have narrowed, about 8 body lengths apart.
0:57:56|0:58:3|[Xiao Lu] arrived at a nostalgic residential area where there weren't many people, but [Xiao Lu] didn't stop walking.
0:58:3|0:58:8|To avoid being noticed by Kana, the quick glance back on the road only lasted a few seconds.
0:58:8|0:58:16|At a bend in the road, he stopped, about to turn and leave when a needle suddenly pierced into his neck.
0:58:16|0:58:22|[Xiao Lu] released his right hand, the restrained leather bag fell freely, while his freed hand fiercely struck towards the opponent's face.
0:58:23|0:58:33|Repeated attacks were blocked by the opponent's arms, so [Xiao Lu] put all his strength into elbow strikes and knee strikes upwards, completing the combat move known as the top elbow strike.
0:58:33|0:58:40|The two close combatants started to struggle with each other, [Xiao Lu] seized the opportunity to grab the syringe and forcefully stabbed towards the other.
0:58:40|0:58:48|Unfortunately, just as the needle stopped above Kana's eye, the medicine in the syringe took effect, and [Xiao Lu] was unable to exert force and fainted.
0:58:48|0:58:53|At this moment, a parked off-road vehicle quickly started and arrived in front of [Kana].
0:58:53|0:58:57|The younger brother got out of the car and put the unconscious [Xiao Lu] into the trunk.
0:58:57|0:59:3|Kana looked proud and confident, after successfully completing the mission he put on his earphones, started the off-road vehicle, and drove away.
0:59:3|0:59:10|On the other side, [Valang] drove with [Ye Lei] in the car, rushing on the rugged mountain road, with dust flying as the car passed by.
0:59:22|0:59:28|[Ye Lei] listened as [Walang] analyzed the situation, and the two gradually arrived at the abandoned cement factory.
0:59:28|0:59:37|Mujin has arrived early, Kana is also on the scene, all the henchmen are dressed in camouflage suits, holding steel guns tightly in their hands, fully armed.
0:59:37|0:59:45|After the car came to a stop, [Ye Lei] and [Wa Lang] got out of the car calmly and walked towards the other side without panic.
0:59:47|0:59:48|Valan embraced Mujin.
1:0:1|1:0:4|The style of the film suddenly changed, and Ye Feng's smile froze on his face.
1:0:9|1:0:14|Mujin hesitated for a moment after hearing it, then turned to look at [Kana], gesturing for him to lead the way.
1:0:14|1:0:20|[Mujin] looked at Valan, smiled, and lightly punched his chest.
1:0:20|1:0:26|Valan also moved forward, signaling with his eyes to [Ye Lei]. [Ye Lei] raised his eyebrows and followed the main force forward.
1:0:26|1:0:30|On the other side, the Blue Fox Special Assault Team has assembled.
1:0:46|1:0:50|The captain received the order, saluted, and then jogged to the transport vehicle.
1:0:50|1:0:55|The two military vehicles carrying the Blue Lake Assault Team set off from the camp.
1:0:58|1:1:1|Tanks, radar vehicles, armed helicopters, and more are all gathered.
1:1:3|1:1:10|They held their ground at the camp, constantly waiting for the next twist of fate, waiting for the news of the [Blue Tiger Squad]'s attack.
1:1:10|1:1:22|In the cement city, the younger brother lifted the thick dusty wooden box, revealing the words on top indicating that this was something left behind by the Japanese 18th Army. The previously killed Xiaomei's belongings were found here.
1:1:22|1:1:40|The younger brother stepped over the bodies, carried the wooden box up, and brought it to [Valan] and [Mujin]. After the box was opened, [Ye Lei] frowned and stared, [Valan] squatted down to observe closely, and as he saw the contents clearly, his pupils suddenly contracted.
1:1:42|1:1:43|Valan Huanhuan stood up.
1:2:9|1:2:13|[Ye Lei] suddenly interrupted, which made [Mu Jin] very unhappy.
1:2:20|1:2:24|Valan chuckled lightly after listening, and he closed the box with his foot.
1:2:27|1:2:29|Valan threatens Mujin with a gun.
1:2:33|1:2:41|[Jin] finished speaking, immediately pushed the gun with his hand, aimed the muzzle at [Valang] and fired, [Kana] also stepped forward to reload, while [Ye Lei] was ambushed by his henchmen in the dark passage.
1:2:41|1:2:48|[Kana] gathered his strength and kicked him unconscious directly. Outside the cement factory, the Blue Lake assault team that had already arrived began their covert mission.
1:2:49|1:2:57|Several people took the lead in the investigation, one person was responsible for covering the rear, and the team members communicated solely through gestures, advancing layer by layer in an orderly manner.
1:2:57|1:3:4|In the cement city, [Mu Jin]'s henchmen dragged away [Wa Lang]'s body, while [Kana] searched [Ye Lei] on the side.
1:3:4|1:3:11|When [Kana] felt the bulge around the waist, his expression changed noticeably, and he carefully observed as he unfastened [Ye Lei]'s belt.
1:3:11|1:3:16|Upon discovering that his hands had been tampered with, he immediately drew out his belt and handed it to [Mu Jin].
1:3:16|1:3:18|[Jin] gestured with his eyes for Kana to leave.
1:3:21|1:3:27|A basin of cold water woke up the fainting Ye Lei, Mu Jin walked up and pinched his chin, saying.
1:3:41|1:3:53|Now I need you to cooperate with me and help me get these things out. [Ye Lei]'s disguise was exposed by [Mu Jin], he remained calm, staring at [Mu Jin] with cold eyes.
1:3:53|1:4:11|Both sides are engaged in a game of wits. The Blue Tiger team, sneaking into the cement plant, keeps moving. They arrive at the wall on the outskirts of the plant, where the abandoned building looks somewhat dilapidated. Apart from the traces left by time, there is no sense of danger. The Blue Tiger team observes the interior of the cement plant through the cracks in the wall.
1:4:11|1:4:15|However, the enemies had already discovered them and hidden their whereabouts in advance.
1:4:38|1:4:40|[Ye Lei] had his hands tied and kept rubbing them in an attempt to break free.
1:4:54|1:4:58|[Ye Lei] did not respond, but his hands did not stop moving.
1:4:58|1:5:13|In the Blue Lake Assault Team, unable to confirm their safety, they remained in place, while the enemy quietly launched an attack. A hand grenade was thrown, and the members of the Blue Lake team immediately reacted.
1:5:13|1:5:19|The intense explosion went off nearby, knocking down the Blue Lake assault team member on the other side of the wall with a powerful shockwave.
1:5:21|1:5:36|Night Thunder, Mu Jin fired another shot, causing Xiao Lu's legs to be completely disabled. Ye Lei heard the explosion, turned his head to look outside, in the thick smoke, bullets mixed with fire were flying in all directions towards the members of the Blue Lake Assault Team.
1:5:37|1:5:44|The sudden enemy action caught them off guard, and the members of the Blue Lake Assault Team quickly adjusted and began organizing a counterattack.
1:5:44|1:5:49|The enemies positioned at a high vantage point are a major disadvantage for them, so the team members prioritize attacking and clearing them out one by one.
1:5:49|1:5:56|[Ye Lei] over here, the henchman who set up the timed bomb signals to Mujin, who walks towards [Ye Lei] and points a gun at him.
1:5:58|1:6:3|Ye Feng suddenly rushed forward, twisted Mujin's gun backhandedly, and aimed it at the henchman behind him.
1:6:3|1:6:14|At the same time, the members of the [Blue Lake Assault Team] who were fighting fiercely with the younger brother of Mujin gradually gained the upper hand. The hidden enemies were taken down one by one, and their accuracy with powerful cover fire was astonishing.
1:6:14|1:6:24|On the other side, Ye Feng, who knocked down Mujin, kicked away the henchman's machine gun, pressed the pistol against the henchman's chest, and fired two shots in quick succession, swiftly resolving the henchman.
1:6:24|1:6:31|Back on the main battlefield, the Blue Fox Assault Team quickly surrounded the enemy, trapping them in their attacking rhythm and steadily reducing their numbers.
1:6:31|1:6:42|In the shadow of Wuda's Water Thunder Tower, [Ye Feng] performs a sliding move, suddenly appearing from below. After successfully taking out the last hidden enemy on the top floor, he quickly returns to the team, and the scene shifts back to this side of [Ye Lei].
1:6:43|1:6:45|He shot and took care of Mujin.
1:6:45|1:6:50|The timed bomb that was set earlier now has less than 30 seconds left before it explodes.
1:6:50|1:6:53|[Ye Lei] puts down the pistol and starts to defuse the bomb.
1:6:53|1:6:59|On the other side, the Blue Tiger team, unscathed, finished off the enemies and began a new round of reconnaissance.
1:6:59|1:7:6|The team, previously scattered due to the operation, gradually gathered together following the captain's signal.
1:7:6|1:7:14|The team members crouched down, moving slowly while continuously firing around, always maintaining a vigilant state.
1:7:14|1:7:17|They never let go of their guns, ready to engage in combat at any time.
1:7:17|1:7:26|The team members gathered around a wall, which provided a broad view. In case of a surprise attack, they could quickly organize themselves for defense and counterattack.
1:7:26|1:7:31|The assembled team members knelt down, and one of them took out a drone to start reconnaissance.
1:7:32|1:7:37|A drone flew overhead, displaying an aerial view on the screen.
1:7:37|1:7:44|The captain carefully observed before putting away the screen, scanning the surrounding buildings in a circle, already having a rough plan in mind.
1:7:44|1:7:51|Next, he assigned tasks to the teammates beside him, and several of them set off to carry out the mission.
1:7:51|1:8:2|The captain left two to three people behind to stay in place, while leading [Ye Feng] to the edge of the stairs. At this point, [Ye Feng] switched to a sniper rifle and climbed straight up the stairs towards the high ground.
1:8:25|1:8:36|[After taking position, Ye Feng's temperament changed drastically. His whole being became highly focused, and the sniper rifle in his hands seemed to transform into another eye, continuously scanning everything in the corner of the cement yard.]
1:8:36|1:8:43|On the other side, the Blue Lake Assault Team left the initial battlefield and gradually advanced into the dangerous interior of the factory.
1:8:43|1:8:50|The interior structure of the factory is complex, and in a seemingly inconspicuous corner, there may be unknown enemies lurking.
1:8:50|1:9:0|The team stopped by a staircase, which was the only way to the inside. Time was of the essence, and inside, [Ye Lei] was still waiting for the team's rescue.
1:9:0|1:9:6|The captain gestured for himself to slowly go upstairs to investigate, facing the imminent danger alone.
1:9:6|1:9:12|After investigating, it seemed that there was no danger upstairs, and the captain gave the signal for safety.
1:9:12|1:9:22|The team slowly moved upstairs, but the captain suddenly glanced down and saw a faint laser beam aiming at the team member's feet.
1:9:22|1:9:29|Captain Ye Feng, realizing something was wrong, rushed forward and pushed his teammates away, and the explosion resounded deafeningly at that moment.
1:9:35|1:9:40|Captain's precise judgment in a critical moment successfully saved a team member's life.
1:9:40|1:9:51|After confirming that everyone was uninjured, the captain signaled to move forward by crawling on the ground using the strength of their arms and legs.
1:9:51|1:9:56|The surrounding cover is relatively low at this time, and this method is undoubtedly the safest.
1:9:56|1:10:0|The scene cuts to [Ye Lei], where the timer on the bomb shows only the last two seconds remaining.
1:10:1|1:10:11|At the critical moment, [Ye Lei] pulled out the fuse connected to the explosives, and the timer finally stopped. At this moment, there was less than a second left before the explosion.
1:10:11|1:10:24|[Ye Lei], who successfully resolved the crisis, didn't have time to check his own injuries. He rushed to the side where Xiaolu had fallen, embracing him. Xiaolu had been shot for a long time, and his mind was already somewhat confused.
1:10:26|1:10:41|Upon seeing that it was [Ye Lei] who lifted him up, a familiar smile appeared on [Xiao Lu]'s face. Dying in the arms of his beloved may also be a kind of relief. He concealed his identity, interacted with [Ye Lei] all the way, and unintentionally fell in love with the man in front of him.
1:10:41|1:10:49|Looking at the already departed [Xiao Lu], [Ye Lei]'s expression was extremely complex. He pressed his face against [Xiao Lu]'s forehead, bidding her a final farewell.
1:10:49|1:10:58|On the other side, the Blue Tiger team that sneaked into the venue stopped in an open area, where they were greeted by a staircase without cover.
1:10:58|1:11:6|The captain took out a drone for observation. The only road to the destination was this one. The Blue Tiger team had no choice but to grit their teeth and set off.
1:11:6|1:11:12|At this moment, a team member stepped forward, standing on the stairs, cautiously moving forward step by step.
1:11:12|1:11:18|Not far away, Ye Feng was crouching on the ground, his sniper rifle ready to go.
1:11:18|1:11:22|A shot rang out, and the team member's right leg was immediately wounded and fell down.
1:11:22|1:11:27|Seeing this situation, the captain following behind immediately rushed towards the injured team member, trying to pull him back.
1:11:43|1:12:5|Find him for me. [Ye Feng] on the rooftop began to move quickly, his high-speed running caught Kana's attention. Kana suddenly turned around, aimed at [Ye Feng], and pulled the trigger. The bullet exploded behind [Ye Feng]. However, [Ye Feng] had already completed the platform with a gap of several meters between buildings, which did not stop his footsteps. After landing, [Ye Feng] used a roll to offset the impact.
1:12:5|1:12:19|He quickly found a wall to take cover behind, adjusted his position to observe the opponent. However, Kana's sniper rifle seemed to have eyes of its own. Despite not having a clear line of sight, it managed to injure Ye Feng's left shoulder through the wall.
1:12:21|1:12:29|The Wolf Fox team took the opportunity to rush out, suppressing the firepower to where Kana was, and at the same time rescued the teammate who had just been injured.
1:12:29|1:12:35|Kana's attack rhythm was interrupted, and he had to find cover to hide and wait for the opportunity to attack again.
1:12:35|1:12:50|The Wolf Fox Assault Team was suppressing firepower, while team member [Lu Liang] tried to take advantage of the opportunity to cross the stairs to the other side. However, Kana turned around and the bullet pierced through [Lu Liang]'s chest, the powerful impact sending him down the stairs, crashing heavily onto the opposite side.
1:12:51|1:13:3|[Lu Liang] had a vacant look in his eyes, blood oozing from his mouth. He used to be a big boy who joked with his teammates, but now, in order to complete the mission, he sacrificed himself in this abandoned cement plant.
1:13:3|1:13:22|In his final memory before leaving, the scene of the hometown's intersection, the longing gaze of his wife, and the eager look of his children waiting for their father, all converged in the mind of [Lu Liang]. His gaze gradually became dull, but in his pupils, the images of his daughter and wife were reflected.
1:13:24|1:13:39|On the other side, after dealing with Mujin, [Ye Lei] arrived at the battlefield. He shot frantically towards Kana from the ground. Kana, unwilling to show weakness, dodged and immediately sniped back. Just as he was about to change positions, [Ye Lei] seized the opportunity.
1:13:39|1:13:46|After a minor incident, Kana was unscathed and moved to another location, with [Ye Lei] following closely behind, descending the stairs.
1:13:46|1:13:53|Previously injured by Kana, [Ye Feng] now regained consciousness. He lay on the ground, reaching slowly towards his wound with his left hand.
1:13:53|1:14:1|The intense pain made him almost unable to move, but his right hand still reached forward with the strength of his body.
1:14:1|1:14:7|The sniper rifle was right in front of him, but [Ye Feng] couldn't move, turning this distance into an insurmountable chasm for him.
1:14:8|1:14:11|Ten centimeters, five centimeters, getting closer gradually.
1:14:11|1:14:18|[Ye Feng], at this moment, with astonishing willpower, slowly moved his body and struggled to move his right hand.
1:14:18|1:14:27|At this moment, he was only a short distance away from the sniper rifle position. Kana, who had climbed to the rooftop, rolled quickly like a meticulous cheetah pouncing towards his target.
1:14:27|1:14:32|He concealed his good mood and didn't rush to attack, just quietly waiting for the prey to show a flaw.
1:14:58|1:15:4|At this moment, the hand outside the wall made the exact same signal for shooting training as before.
1:15:4|1:15:9|After [Ye Lei] finished giving [Ye Feng] the cue, he immediately moved towards the location where Kana was.
1:15:9|1:15:16|[Ye Feng] is slowly lowering his body at the moment, his hand that is continuously bleeding has already formed a pool of blood on the ground.
1:15:16|1:15:24|Kana sensed something was wrong, peeked out to observe, only to be firmly blocked in position by the arrival of [Ye Lei], forcing him to wait in place.
1:15:24|1:15:32|[Ye Feng] used all his strength to stand up, unable to use his hands due to injuries, becoming the stabilizer for the mechanical gun at this moment.
1:15:33|1:15:54|The sniper and the gun were perfectly integrated. He pulled the trigger towards 1 o'clock, and the bullet flew past, successfully hitting Kana's head from behind. Kana fell forward, the sniper rifle in his hand and the wig falling together. The mysterious sniper who had been invincible on the battlefield was now slowly coming to an end under the night wind and thunder.
1:15:56|1:16:3|Upon hearing the gunshot, Ye Lei quickly arrived at the platform, confirmed that Kana had died, and then looked towards Ye Feng on the opposite side.
1:16:3|1:16:17|[Ye Feng] dragged his heavy body out of the cover, with his left hand holding the gun and his right hand slowly raised high. The palm of his hand faced the opponent, and he raised his thumb, index finger, and little finger in turn, mimicking the shooting gesture that [Ye Lei] had just shown him.
1:16:17|1:16:23|[Ye Lei] also raised his gun in response, the two of them standing on opposite sides of the platform, as if they were back to their original mission execution days.
1:16:24|1:16:31|The mission completed, a military jeep carrying [Ye Feng] and [Ye Lei] returned to the military base on You Island.
1:16:31|1:16:45|At this moment, all the soldiers in the camp, including the band, are waiting for the arrival of the plane carrying [Ye Feng] and [Ye Lei]. With the five stars rising together and the fluttering military flag, the silent warriors quietly protect the country's security.
1:16:45|1:16:47|After the car came to a stop, [Ye Feng] and [Ye Lei] got out of the car.
1:17:14|1:17:50|After hiding for a long time, [Ye Lei] finally returned to the army. The two saluted each other again, then turned around and walked back. When they returned to the team, the captain spoke. After the captain gave the order, he took off his military cap with both hands, and all comrades also followed suit. Everyone's actions were surprisingly consistent. The captain took a step forward, then turned to look at the neatly folded military flag, saluting to our fallen comrades.
1:17:50|1:17:55|After hearing the password, everyone's face turned serious.
1:17:55|1:18:0|The sacrifice of comrades has caused great sorrow to everyone.
1:18:0|1:18:5|Everyone put on their military caps and bid farewell.
1:18:5|1:18:8|Captain Ye Feng scanned the surroundings and spoke.
1:19:8|1:19:17|Amidst the applause, [Ye Lei] did his best and after two years of undercover work, he finally completed the mission excellently.
1:19:17|1:19:33|In China, there are countless individuals like him, in the blue skies of the motherland, on the rivers and seas, on the border walls, in peacekeeping camps, unafraid of harsh environments, facing difficulties and dangers without fear, silently carrying out duties and missions, selflessly dedicating their youth and lives without regret.
1:19:37|1:19:43|On a sunny afternoon, [Ye Feng] in camouflage clothing appeared on an observation deck.
1:19:43|1:19:48|Far away from the city, a gentle breeze blows, causing the plants to sway in the wind.
1:19:48|1:19:54|[Ye Lei] leaned against the railing, looking at the scenery in the distance, the cityscape unfolding before his eyes.
1:19:54|1:20:0|[Ye Feng] walked slowly towards the railing, finally stopping next to [Ye Lei], standing silently.
1:20:0|1:20:3|Ye Lei felt Ye Feng's arrival and turned his body to look at him.
1:20:5|1:20:8|[Ye Lei] is dressed in casual clothes, highlighting his figure.
1:20:8|1:20:12|His resolute face, with thick and thin eyebrows tightly furrowed.
1:20:12|1:20:17|Deep in thought, he seemed to recall the sacrifice of Xiao Lu, perhaps a fallen comrade.
1:20:17|1:20:22|In the end, [Ye Lei] smiled contentedly, letting all his thoughts drift away with the wind towards the distance.
1:20:22|1:20:24|Two years ago, [Ye Feng] met [Huang Shilong] in a fierce battle.
1:20:27|1:20:28|[Ye Feng] takes out a bullet.
1:20:38|1:20:42|The bullet has been through two years, with faint traces of blood still remaining on it.
1:20:42|1:20:45|He witnessed the whole process of Ye Feng's revenge.
1:20:45|1:20:52|[Ye Lei] took the bullet from [Ye Feng]'s hand, and it felt like time had turned back to when the two of them were fighting in the jungle.
1:20:52|1:20:58|[Ye Lei] released his fingers, and the bullet fell from the air, dropping into the deep valley ahead.
1:20:58|1:21:1|[Ye Feng] first looked puzzled, then his expression turned into a smile of resignation.
1:21:3|1:21:13|[Ye Lei] also smiled in response, and the two patted each other's shoulders. This is the camaraderie between comrades, not adding flowers to brocade, but giving charcoal in the snow.
1:21:13|1:21:27|After experiencing several life-threatening crises, [Ye Feng] and [Huang Shilong] have returned to the tranquility of the past at this moment. They gaze into the distance, where lies the place they have been guarding day and night, dedicating their youth without regrets for the security of the country.
