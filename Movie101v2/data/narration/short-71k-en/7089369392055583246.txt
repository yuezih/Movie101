0:1:19|0:1:25|A man riding a bicycle happened to witness this scene, quickly stopped and said something to the woman before chasing after the man in the leather jacket.
0:1:25|0:1:30|Despite the woman holding a dog and waving her hand to signal not to chase, he, a first-rate duck, still caught up with her.
0:1:31|0:1:42|The story begins here, mainly focusing on the story of an 80-year-old father and daughter who strive and struggle for their dreams, love, and more.

0:2:4|0:2:8|Obviously, the man in the leather jacket has been caught up with, holding his helmet and being questioned.
0:2:55|0:3:4|Officer Zhang picked up the newspaper on the table and unfolded it, while the female officer next to him covered her mouth and nose.
0:3:4|0:3:10|Officer Zhang didn't expect to see dog poop in the newspaper, which left him stunned.
0:3:10|0:3:11|Officer Zhang picks up the dog poop.
0:3:44|0:3:45|[Zheng Jin] raised an eyebrow and said.
0:4:10|0:4:13|[Zheng Jin] gestured with a finger and continued speaking.
0:4:18|0:4:19|Speak up, [Zheng Jin] is getting up.

0:4:59|0:5:7|In the sales office, the female salesperson [Zhang Li] is standing at the door giggling, she hurriedly takes out her phone and runs to the door to answer the call.
0:5:7|0:5:11|Boyfriend [Wang Xiaopo] walked towards the car while talking.
0:5:22|0:5:25|At the same time, in another car, [Wang Xiaopo] said to Shen Yun.
0:5:54|0:6:0|Shen Yan's car collided with Wang Xiaopo's car at the intersection, and Wang Xiaopo quickly got out of the car to check.
0:6:10|0:6:12|Xiao Tang finished speaking and turned to leave.
0:6:29|0:6:30|[Da Xu] raised the chopsticks and blew a sound.
0:6:45|0:6:48|Wang Xiaopo's expression suddenly changed, and Da Xu quickly put on a smile.
0:7:39|0:7:41|The three of them clinked glasses, then [Da Xu] turned his head and said.
0:8:24|0:8:39|Upon hearing what Anonymity said, [Wang Xiaopo] and [Da Xu] were stunned.
0:8:39|0:8:47|After the three of them clinked glasses again, the scene shifted to an indoor room filled with models, where everyone was busy with their work.
0:8:47|0:8:52|[Wang Xiaopo] and [Da Xu] sat next to each other, pointing and gesturing at the painting on the table.
0:9:37|0:9:44|Wu Ming took out a marker and wrote on the paper, while [Wang Xiaopo] looked down in surprise. Wu Ming handed the paper over.
0:9:44|0:9:47|Da Xu quickly picked it up and both of them couldn't help but get excited.
0:9:51|0:9:56|Wu Mingjiang only cared about the past and glanced at [Wang Xiaopo] as he spoke.
0:9:56|0:10:10|The scene shifts to the central area of Nanjing. In a high-rise building by the road, a rural woman walks in, looks around, surveys the spacious office, and then walks in with a contented smile, asking.
0:10:45|0:10:50|Wang Xiaopo was leaning tightly on the table, looking behind the woman to check on the staff.
0:10:50|0:10:52|The woman also took a look.
0:10:52|0:11:4|On the other side, at Officer Zhang's home, Officer Zhang's mother sat on the sofa reading a magazine, while Officer Zhang changed channels with the remote control and talked on the phone with her boyfriend, [Wang Xiaopo].
0:11:4|0:11:11|Mrs. Zhang turned her head to look at her daughter when she heard this, then lowered her head to glance at the magazine in her hand.
0:11:11|0:11:12|What did Zhang Li suddenly think of?
0:11:24|0:11:25|Officer Zhang closes his phone.
0:11:34|0:11:41|Zhang Li impatiently got up and left, then Officer Zhang opened the door, put the key in the briefcase, and walked towards the sofa.
0:11:44|0:11:51|[Mrs. Zhang] pointed inside the room and patted her husband's leg.
0:12:5|0:12:9|Hurry up and get me something to eat, [Mrs. Zhang] stood up.
0:12:15|0:12:20|Officer Zhang took a sip of tea, picked up the newspaper on the coffee table, and took a date from the plate.
0:12:20|0:12:22|He flipped through the newspaper, and a jujube fell down.
0:12:22|0:12:24|Just picked up, stuffed back into the mouth.
0:12:30|0:12:36|Officer Zhang spat out the snuff bottle, stuffed the newspaper back onto the coffee table, and quickly picked up the bowl.
0:12:36|0:12:37|[Mrs. Zhang] sits back on the sofa.
0:13:9|0:13:11|Officer Zhang turned his head and picked up a dish to serve Mrs. Zhang.
0:13:16|0:13:20|The scene shifts to the auto repair shop, where Wang Xiaopo is studying blueprints at a table.
0:13:20|0:13:23|[Da Xu] put down the iron rod in his hand and walked to [Wang Xiaopo]'s side.
0:13:23|0:13:25|[Wang Xiaopo] pulled the table.
0:13:52|0:13:56|On the battlefield, it's all about the heat of the moment. [Da Xu] rubbed his hands nervously and asked.
0:14:50|0:14:56|[Mrs. Zheng] squatted down and put down the dog, holding the leash. A golden retriever ran over, scaring [Zheng Jin] who quickly ran away.
0:15:48|0:15:51|The ladies sniffed the sesame in their arms and then went to sniff the serious one.
0:16:26|0:16:28|[Wang Xiaopo] grabbed a handful of hair fiercely.
0:16:36|0:16:46|The two of them started to get busy, with [Wang Xiaopo] marking on the floor, then picking up the cutting machine, welding, putting on gloves to work. In the repair shop, sparks from welding were flying.
0:16:46|0:16:54|In a blink of an eye, he put down the electric drill, selected the parts, then put on sunglasses, and started cutting with a saw to make parts for the renovation car.
0:16:55|0:17:2|[Da Xu] is working on the site, putting down one tool and picking up another due to the welding situation of the iron saw.
0:17:2|0:17:5|In the abandoned recycling center, Wang Xiaopo and Zheng Jin worked from dawn till dusk.
0:17:7|0:17:10|The night falls, and the scene shifts to Zhang Li's home.
0:17:10|0:17:15|[Zhang Li] hung family photos on the wall next to the bed, and there was also a string of wind chimes in the middle of the room.
0:17:15|0:17:20|[Zhang Li] is listening to music, swaying her body in front of the mirror on the dressing table.
0:17:20|0:17:30|[Mrs. Zheng] pushed open the door of [Zhang Li], holding several cards in her hand, happily approaching her daughter, carefully taking off one side of her headphones.
0:17:30|0:17:33|[Mrs. Zheng] held up the card in her hand, but [Zhang Li] turned her head and lay down on the bed.
0:17:59|0:18:3|[Zhang Li] was about to leave as soon as she heard it, and Mrs. Zhang quickly pulled her up.
0:18:10|0:18:17|[Zhang Li] turned around.
0:18:17|0:18:25|In the repair shop, [Wang Xiaopo] is lying on the car roof, holding a flashlight and working busily.
0:18:25|0:18:28|Speaking without stopping the movement of his hands.

0:18:33|0:18:35|Hastily hand the parts to [Da Xu] and answer the phone.
0:18:40|0:18:45|He threw the gloves onto the toolbox.
0:18:45|0:18:51|Listening to his girlfriend, [Wang Xiaopo] scratched his thumb on his head.
0:18:51|0:18:56|The whole face wrinkled towards the center.
0:19:3|0:19:6|Both of them were attracted by the sound outside the door.
0:19:6|0:19:10|[Da Xu] widened his eyes.
0:19:14|0:19:17|[Wang Xiaopo] recognized the person in the car.
0:19:17|0:19:24|He walked to the passenger side window and bent down.
0:19:57|0:20:10|[Da Xu], although reluctant, still checked the car's condition, while the two girls got out of the car.
0:20:13|0:20:19|It's late at night, Wang Xiaopo and Da Xu walk out of the auto repair shop, watching the two girls drive away.
0:20:23|0:20:24|[Da Xu] takes off his gloves.
0:21:25|0:21:30|Hanging up the phone, [Zheng Jin] put away his smile and spoke into the phone.
0:21:30|0:21:46|The scene shifts to the workplace where Wang Xiaopo works. The squad leader is carrying a tea pot, Wang Xiaopo quickly pats his colleague, sits up straight, the squad leader coughs slightly, puts down the tea pot, Wang Xiaopo yawns, the squad leader sits down and says.
0:21:47|0:21:51|The company has started, with a meeting of senior leaders above the platoon leader level.
0:22:17|0:22:20|Upon hearing this, [Wang Xiaopo] turned his head and said to the squad leader.
0:22:39|0:22:43|Go, stop talking nonsense, [Wang Xiaopo] gets up and leaves.
0:22:45|0:22:49|Night falls, and the streetlights and car lights all come on.
0:22:49|0:22:56|[Wang Xiaopo] drove the car and brought [Zhang Li] to the park on the hill. Looking down from the trees, they could see the night view of the entire Nanjing.
0:22:56|0:23:4|The car slowly came to a stop, its headlights also turned off, blending into the night.
0:23:4|0:23:12|[Wang Xiaopo] turns on the interior lights of the car and looks out the window.
0:23:12|0:23:12|He pointed outside.
0:23:35|0:23:38|His face gradually turned serious, he turned to his girlfriend and asked.
0:23:44|0:23:52|[Zhang Li] looked at him, thought for a moment, and sighed.
0:23:52|0:23:58|[Wang Xiaopo] furrowed his brow, and [Zhang Li] paused before speaking.
0:23:58|0:24:6|[Zhang Li] stopped looking at him after hearing this, and [Wang Xiaopo] also looked out the window.
0:24:8|0:24:15|He reached into his pocket, took out his phone, glanced at it, and pressed the answer button.
0:24:15|0:24:18|[Zhang Li] patted [Wang Xiaopo].
0:24:26|0:24:30|[Zhang Li] listened eagerly.
0:24:34|0:24:39|Hanging up the phone, [Zhang Li] looked at [Wang Xiaopo], who still had his head down gloomily.
0:24:45|0:24:48|[Wang Xiaopo] finally turned his head and spoke with determination.
0:25:4|0:25:10|[Zhang Li] excitedly questioned [Wang Xiaopo], but [Wang Xiaopo] just looked at him calmly without saying a word.
0:25:10|0:25:13|Zhang Li leaned against the car, Wang Xiaopo lowered his head and said.
0:25:16|0:25:31|[Wang Xiaopo] tapped the car door with his index finger, opened it, put on his sunglasses, and got out of the car. [Zhang Li] watched him, opened her mouth, then turned to look out the car window to see if [Wang Xiaopo] was walking away. She also opened the car door and got out, calling out to [Wang Xiaopo].
0:25:32|0:25:36|[Wang Xiaopo] did not turn around. With the knocking sound, a beam of light lit up inside the room.
0:25:38|0:25:45|[Mrs. Zhang] opened the door, in the pitch-black corridor, only the face of a woman was illuminated.
0:25:45|0:25:47|It turns out that [Zhang Li] was looking at her phone.
0:25:51|0:25:54|She walked slowly into her room with heavy steps.
0:25:54|0:25:57|[Mrs. Zhang] followed and turned on the lights in the room.
0:25:59|0:26:0|[Zhang Li] has already laid down.
0:26:10|0:26:15|[Zhang Li] turned over with a stuffed toy in her arms, with [Mrs. Zhang]'s hand resting on her arm.
0:26:21|0:26:23|Mrs. Zhang touched her daughter's back.
0:26:27|0:26:30|She picked up a piece of paper from the table and wiped her daughter's tears.
0:26:37|0:26:45|[Zhang Li] grabbed her.
0:26:45|0:26:52|[Zhang Li] flipped over and faced upwards.
0:26:52|0:26:56|[Mrs. Zhang] had a big smile on her face.
0:27:42|0:27:44|[Da Xu] approached for inquiry.
0:28:1|0:28:3|[Wang Xiaopo] twisted the parts and asked [Da Xu].
0:28:8|0:28:12|He turned his head in surprise.
0:28:12|0:28:16|Wang Xiaopo's neck muscles also bulged.
0:28:16|0:28:17|He turned to [Da Xu].
0:28:25|0:28:28|The two turned around to put away the tools and prepare for the test drive.
0:29:3|0:29:11|[Da Xu] struggles to come down from the roof of the car.
0:29:58|0:30:2|In the yard outside the repair shop, [Da Xu] is directing in the front.
0:30:28|0:30:30|Da Xu's big foot stretched in.
0:30:30|0:30:32|Da Xu's big belly was exposed.
0:30:53|0:30:57|The cannon of the armored vehicle hit a tree.
0:30:57|0:31:3|[Da Xu] hit his head.
0:31:3|0:31:10|He quickly climbed out of the car and went down to check the situation.
0:31:10|0:31:14|Smoke billowed from the front of the armored vehicle.
0:31:14|0:31:15|[Wang Xiaopo] is wiping off sweat.
0:31:23|0:31:26|[Da Xu] struggled to pull out the cannon barrel.
0:31:43|0:31:48|The cannon unexpectedly got pulled out and was thrown away directly.
0:31:48|0:31:55|[Wang Xiaopo] kept backing away in fear, while [Da Xu] stood on the roof of the car, staring blankly.
0:31:55|0:31:58|The next day, inside the cafe.
0:32:22|0:32:25|[Zhang Li] put away her smile and looked around awkwardly.
0:32:25|0:32:29|The returnee man smiled warmly, with his hands resting on his legs, looking at [Zhang Li].
0:32:31|0:32:35|The returnee man took a deep breath.
0:32:50|0:32:55|[Zhang Li] showed a surprised smile and then looked at the returnee man across from her.
0:33:7|0:33:15|Outside the café, the sun was shining brightly. [Wang Xiaopo] rode his bicycle through the sunlight and the shade of the trees, drawing S shapes on the ground.
0:33:15|0:33:22|Approaching the destination, [Wang Xiaopo] smoothly slides one foot on the ground, deftly turns to the side of the road to park, puts down the kickstand, and then walks towards the café.
0:33:24|0:33:29|He happily took out the ticket from his shirt pocket, took big strides up the steps, and pushed the door open.
0:33:37|0:33:41|[Wang Xiaopo] stood behind the wooden fence, hands inserted, watching [Zhang Li].
0:33:41|0:33:43|Wang Xiaopo looks towards Haiguinan.
0:33:58|0:34:5|Wang Xiaopo turned around, then immediately turned back, placed the ticket in front of Zhang Li, and then turned and pushed the door open to leave.
0:34:52|0:34:53|He picked up the briefcase and started searching through it.
0:35:2|0:35:19|He put down the phone with his right hand, the briefcase with his left hand, and unbuttoned his shirt with his teeth, revealing a scratch on his ankle. He raised his phone to check the wound, then pulled out a piece of paper, wincing in pain. The scene shifted to the repair shop, where Wang Xiaopo was shooting hoops in front of a makeshift basketball hoop.
0:35:19|0:35:27|The armored vehicle stopped by his side, and the basketball dropped out of the hoop. [Wang Xiaopo] missed the shot, and the ball rolled to the side of the armored vehicle.
0:35:28|0:35:31|He bent down to pick it up, but hit his head when he stood up.
0:35:31|0:35:42|[Wang Xiaopo] didn't care about basketball anymore, he covered his head, bent over, and then straightened up.
0:35:42|0:35:46|After he put his hand down, he still felt pain and touched his head again.
0:36:18|0:36:24|He picked up the pliers and fiercely smashed them towards the front of the armored vehicle, then took two steps back and threw the pliers directly.
0:36:27|0:36:28|Threw the axe again.
0:36:31|0:36:35|The glass of the armored vehicle shattered on the ground, and [Wang Xiaopo] turned around and left after urging once.
0:36:35|0:36:42|The scene shifts to an outdoor setting, at a city wall entrance in Nanjing. [Mrs. Zheng] is walking along the road, shouting as she goes.
0:36:42|0:36:47|The surface of Xuanwu Lake ripples, and looking across the lake, there are rows of buildings on the opposite side.
0:36:47|0:36:56|[Mrs. Zheng] was desperately searching for her Pekingese, walking all the way to the lakeside, holding onto both arms as she descended the steps.
0:36:56|0:36:57|She sat down by the lake.
0:37:6|0:37:12|He pounded his legs hard, when suddenly, his phone rang.
0:37:12|0:37:15|He reached into his pocket and took out his phone.
0:38:18|0:38:23|The scene cuts back to [Wang Xiaopo], who lowers his head and returns to his rented room in silence.
0:38:23|0:38:27|Pushing open the door, the walls were covered with various blueprints for two-wheeled vehicles.
0:38:27|0:38:36|[Wang Xiaopo] took off his shirt, without even looking, casually threw it onto the nearby clothes rack, then walked over to the lower bunk of the bunk bed and sat down. As he sat down, he suddenly squinted his eyes tightly.
0:39:42|0:39:47|Seeing that no one paid attention to him, [Wang Xiaopo] angrily slammed the door and walked away.
0:39:47|0:39:56|After entering the room, he took out his phone, glanced at it, pressed a button, then threw it aside. He pulled out a piece of paper from under the table, tore it open, and stuffed it into his ear.
0:39:56|0:40:0|Sitting on the bed, he listened for a moment before turning around to continue sleeping.
0:40:0|0:40:5|Just as he was about to cover himself with the blanket, he hesitated and put it back down, then stopped for a moment and listened again before finally covering his head with it.
0:40:7|0:40:15|The scene then cuts to the street, where [Da Xu] is riding his bicycle, with taxis and buses passing by him.
0:40:15|0:40:19|He wiped the sweat while riding, but the speed on his feet never slowed down.
0:40:19|0:40:23|And Wang Xiaopo was already fast asleep, with his phone lying on the table.
0:40:23|0:40:29|Looking down from the window near the roadside, [Da Xu] angrily stopped his bicycle by the side of the road.
0:40:35|0:40:39|Da Xu immediately got off the bike, put it on the steps, and ran upstairs.
0:40:39|0:40:50|Da Xu, climbing the stairs, had a warm face covered in sweat.
0:40:50|0:40:54|[Da Xu] pushed open the door with the glass panel and attempted to wake up [Wang Xiaopo] with a stick.
0:41:20|0:41:21|There was finally movement on the bed.
0:41:34|0:41:44|[Da Xu] was hanging on the door, [Wang Xiaopo] came over, hugged his legs and lifted them up, allowing [Da Xu] to free his arms.
0:41:44|0:41:46|[Wang Xiaopo] threw the stick out of the door.
0:42:1|0:42:6|[Da Xu] lifts the blanket, turns his head, and then pulls the blanket back over himself.
0:42:19|0:42:24|[Wang Xiaopo] suddenly sat up, [Wang Xiaopo] said a sentence, and then lay back down.
0:42:37|0:42:40|After he finished speaking, he threw himself back onto the bed.
0:43:6|0:43:8|[Da Xu] pointed at [Wang Xiaopo] and said,
0:43:21|0:43:27|Pushing Wang Xiaopo's back again, Wang Xiaopo kicked the blanket with one foot, finally getting both legs onto the edge of the bed.
0:43:27|0:43:36|Da Xu handed him the shirt, Wang Xiaopo got up and turned back, pushing Da Xu aside with one hand, and walked to the table to grab the phone.
0:43:36|0:43:46|[Da Xu] followed and walked out the door, while pressing his wound and talking on the phone.
0:43:51|0:43:57|During the conversation, the previous woman suddenly rushed in, knelt on the ground, and Wang Xiaopo quickly half-knelt to pull her up.
0:44:28|0:44:30|Feng Nu shook off [Zheng Jin]'s hand.
0:44:30|0:44:35|[Zheng Jin] was about to speak, but when he saw his colleagues outside the glass window watching, he quickly waved his hand.
0:44:35|0:44:38|The colleague outside the window immediately ran around the green plants behind and ran away.
0:44:38|0:44:40|A male colleague beckons Xiaotang over.
0:46:2|0:46:3|Father and daughter high-fived, looking very proud.
0:46:9|0:46:17|[Zheng Jin] walked towards the door and saw [Wang Xiaopo] coming out. His colleagues pretended to be busy, and he approached Xiao Tang.
0:46:18|0:46:22|But then he looked at the person next to him and beckoned him to come with him.
0:46:22|0:46:24|Xiao Tang followed up, [Zheng Jin] looked around.
0:47:10|0:47:14|Xiao Tang looked up, avoiding eye contact, then lowered his head to reach into his pocket and pulled out some folded money.
0:48:31|0:48:39|[Zhang Li] hesitated for a moment, and her colleague smiled and said.
0:48:39|0:48:51|Reporter Chen stepped on a nail, the camera turned to the repair shop, where the armored vehicle smashed by Wang Xiaopo lay in ruins.
0:48:51|0:48:55|[Da Xu] walked in, saw the armored vehicle, and his steps noticeably slowed down, his hands also dropped.
0:48:57|0:49:8|He walked quickly to the armored vehicle, bending over to look at the front windshield, and on the side of the vehicle, [Wang Xiaopo] also walked over.
0:49:8|0:49:19|[Da Xu] was at a loss, turned around and asked [Wang Xiaopo]. [Wang Xiaopo] raised his hand, pouted and put it down. [Da Xu] looked at him, then looked at the armored vehicle, and then looked back at him.
0:49:22|0:49:31|[Wang Xiaopo] lowered his head as [Da Xu] turned to look at the armored vehicle, then rushed towards [Wang Xiaopo] and pushed him hard.
0:49:31|0:49:43|[Wang Xiaopo] took two steps back, then walked back to [Da Xu] in silence. [Da Xu] pointed at him and spoke.
0:49:43|0:49:48|Da Xu moved his eyes widely, took two steps towards the armored vehicle, and then pointed at Wang Xiaopo.
0:49:55|0:50:14|Da Xu leaned forward and shouted, quickly walked to the armored vehicle, pointing and asking. Da Xu walked up to Wang Xiaopo, raised his hand and slapped the back of his head, then turned back to pick up the hammer in front of the armored vehicle.
0:50:16|0:50:28|After the fight, [Da Xu] walked up to [Wang Xiaopo], handed him the hammer, and gestured towards his own head.
0:50:28|0:50:35|[Wang Xiaopo] pulled hard, breaking free from [Da Xu]'s grip, and took two steps back.
0:50:35|0:50:39|Da Xu points towards the armored vehicle in front of him.
0:50:39|0:50:40|[Wang Xiaopo] lowered his head.
0:50:44|0:50:48|[Da Xu] raised his arm, palm against [Wang Xiaopo]'s neck, and pushed hard.
0:50:48|0:50:53|[Wang Xiaopo] staggered back a step, adjusted his collar in silence, and walked towards the armored vehicle.
0:50:53|0:50:57|[Da Xu] steps forward.
0:50:57|0:51:4|[Wang Xiaopo] propped himself up on the armored vehicle with a hammer, arched his back, limbs contracted, and then pushed up to his forehead along his face.
0:51:8|0:51:12|He raised his index finger, gave it a strong shake, covered his face with his hand, and then threw the hammer.
0:51:48|0:51:54|[Da Xu] pushed Wang Xiaopo's face, and Wang Xiaopo couldn't control himself anymore, so he hugged Da Xu.
0:51:54|0:51:57|[Da Xu] also held him tightly, punching his back with his fist.
0:52:2|0:52:4|[Da Xu] pushed [Wang Xiaopo] aside and grabbed his shoulder.
0:52:4|0:52:5|[Da Xu] slapped him.
0:52:5|0:52:8|At the KTV entrance on the other side.
0:52:28|0:52:31|[Zhang Li] is looking at her phone, while Shen Yan and Reporter Chen are waving their hands.
0:52:40|0:52:41|The two of them walked and chatted while complaining.
0:52:57|0:53:6|Next, the scene shifts to a small grove, where [Zheng Jin] is holding a pair of binoculars under a tree, when suddenly she hears a woman's voice.
0:53:6|0:53:12|She was hit by a mineral water bottle.
0:53:19|0:53:24|Zheng Jin stared intently in the direction of the man and woman, while quietly sneaking to the side.
0:53:24|0:53:30|Across the street, Mrs. Zheng, still wearing her daytime clothes, bent over and walked to a tree in front of a large billboard.
0:53:30|0:53:37|Seeing someone approaching, [Zheng Jin] raised the binoculars, while Mrs. Zheng found a piece of bluestone and placed the ransom wrapped in a plastic bag underneath.
0:53:37|0:53:45|[Zheng Jin] watched as [Mrs. Zheng] walked away briskly, setting down the binoculars and gazing in the direction she left. In the pile of grass, there was a man waiting for her, holding a wrench in his hand.
0:53:46|0:54:1|The man shook his head and waved his hand, while the two squatted down to watch the money drop. The scene shifted to Wang Xiaopo and Da Xu, who were driving on the road in an armored vehicle. Wang Xiaopo was inside the car, leaning forward cautiously while driving, while Da Xu had half of his body outside the car, even though Wang Xiaopo couldn't see him.
0:54:1|0:54:18|But he kept making various gestures, [Wang Xiaopo] occasionally looked up to ask, [Da Xu] was very pleased and waved to the cars next to him. In the crowded streets, the armored vehicle was very conspicuous, and other cars kept avoiding it. However, [Wang Xiaopo] couldn't see the road conditions, while [Da Xu] was only focused on having fun.
0:54:18|0:54:20|Resting his head weakly on the steering wheel.
0:54:20|0:54:22|An armored vehicle slowly drives through the tunnel.
0:54:22|0:54:26|The cars next to it are all changing lanes because it's driving too slowly.
0:54:26|0:54:30|[Da Xu] saluted and clapped like a leader.
0:54:30|0:54:37|In the car, [Wang Xiaopo] was sweating profusely, with visible sweat on the steering wheel, frowning, and looking up at [Da Xu].
0:54:37|0:54:40|[Da Xu] first gestured as if shooting a gun, then saluted.
0:54:40|0:54:46|On his side, you can see the safety line pulled up by the construction site on the street, passing by the entrance of a free trade zone.
0:54:46|0:54:52|Riding his bicycle, Reporter Chen noticed that the armored vehicle and Da Xu had stopped. He turned back while pedaling.
0:55:3|0:55:11|Road maintenance workers are chatting while working underground, when suddenly the silent one crashes into two workers along with his car.
0:55:31|0:55:38|Da Xu suddenly rushed back.
0:55:38|0:55:52|He climbed out of the car, using both hands to push forward with all his might. His upper body was leaning against the car, but the armored vehicle didn't move. [Da Xu] leaned against the back of the car, panting, but unexpectedly the armored vehicle started moving down the slope. [Da Xu] lost his balance, fell to the ground, and quickly got up to chase after the car.
0:55:57|0:56:4|On the other side of the construction site, [Reporter Chen] climbed up the pile of soil, his glasses askew on his nose, digging into the soil.
0:56:23|0:56:24|Officer Zhang, who was passing by, approached to inquire.
0:56:24|0:56:26|Reporter Chen sat on the ground, looking aggrieved.
0:56:53|0:56:56|Officer Zhang tilted his head and pointed at Reporter Chen's butt, sniffing.
0:56:58|0:57:0|Reporter Chen immediately stood up to check.
0:57:2|0:57:6|A taxi happened to drive by, and Officer Zhang hailed it.
0:57:7|0:57:13|Two workers walked ahead, slowly approaching the taxi, and then they opened the car door and got in.
0:57:13|0:57:16|Reporter Shen slowly walked up to the car and opened the passenger door.
0:57:16|0:57:25|Officer Zhang saw the three of them get into the car and pointed ahead to the driver.
0:57:25|0:57:31|The taxi slowly drove away, Officer Zhang watched the car leave, hands behind his back, tilting his head slightly to the side, deep in thought.
0:57:34|0:57:38|He glanced around and immediately ran towards the police car.
0:57:38|0:57:48|At this moment, the armored vehicle has entered the view of the standard telescope.
0:57:48|0:57:51|In the midst of their loud shouting, the cannon of the armored vehicle pierced into the large billboard.
0:58:50|0:58:53|Da Xu, who was just about to get up, suddenly stopped.
0:58:53|0:58:59|Wang Xiaopo, still looking at the wheel, slowly emerges from under the car, watching as Da Xu leans on the ground and moves towards the car.
0:59:9|0:59:11|[Wang Xiaopo] got up, but almost fell down.
0:59:11|0:59:15|Da Xu is wearing him.
0:59:27|0:59:28|Mrs. Zheng is holding it.
0:59:38|0:59:40|She then nudged her younger brother with her elbow as she spoke.
0:59:50|0:59:54|After speaking, Mrs. Zheng stood up, bent over, grabbed her hat, and walked away with small steps.
0:59:54|0:59:58|Inside the armored vehicle, Wang Xiaopo's forehead was covered in sweat as he tried to start the engine.
0:59:58|1:0:2|Unable to succeed in one try, he pursed his lips and tried again. [Da Xu]'s head popped in.
1:0:4|1:0:6|[Wang Xiaopo] looked up at him.
1:0:11|1:0:15|He wiped the sweat off with his arm, [Da Xu] propped himself up inside and left the hole on the car roof first.
1:0:15|1:0:22|[Wang Xiaopo] wiped the sweat off again, left the driver's seat, unaware that Officer Zhang across the street was observing the situation with binoculars.
1:0:32|1:0:37|[Wang Xiaopo] glanced around.
1:0:37|1:0:50|He stood with one hand on his hip, looking around the armored vehicle.
1:0:50|1:0:55|Da Xu also bent at the waist, while Wang Xiaopo supported his knee with one hand and bent down, looking towards Da Xu.
1:0:58|1:1:18|[Da Xu] put [Wang Xiaopo]'s arm over his shoulder and they walked towards the construction site together. Seeing the two of them leave, Officer Zhang put down his binoculars, then immediately picked them up again to continue observing.
1:1:18|1:1:23|Not long after, [Wang Xiaopo] and [Da Xu] covered the armored vehicle with many branches, both of them spitting out saliva.
1:1:36|1:1:38|[Wang Xiaopo] checks while [Da Xu] runs over.
1:1:42|1:1:44|[Wang Xiaopo] pulled [Da Xu] aside to hide.
1:1:48|1:1:51|[Wang Xiaopo] is holding a tree branch, about to hide himself as well.
1:1:51|1:1:54|Da Xu quickly grabbed a branch to shield himself upon seeing the situation.
1:1:54|1:2:6|Officer Zhang's police car drives up on the road, and he looks out from the passenger seat.
1:2:6|1:2:11|Seeing the police car leave, [Wang Xiaopo] pushed aside the branches and took a step forward.
1:2:11|1:2:13|[Da Xu] also put down the branches and asked.
1:2:17|1:2:24|[Wang Xiaopo] stood with one hand on his hip, nodding.
1:2:24|1:2:30|Both of them turned around, but kept an eye on the direction the police car was leaving.
1:2:30|1:2:37|The scene cuts to the home of Zheng Jin, where Mrs. Zheng is asleep on the sofa, still holding a photo of sesame in her arms, with the phone placed on the armrest.
1:3:5|1:3:8|After hanging up the phone, he picked up the photo and was about to leave.
1:3:8|1:3:10|The next day, [Zhang Li] sat with her colleagues.
1:3:27|1:3:37|[Zhang Li] got up from her seat, walked to the front desk, and took out a small model from under the table. The bottom was a rear end, the top was a camouflage tank, and there were some grass decorations on the side.
1:3:37|1:3:47|Looking at the model, [Zhang Li] recalled the moment when she received this gift, when she and [Wang Xiaopo] were sitting on the bus, [Zhang Li] glanced at him.
1:4:29|1:4:33|Wang Xiaopo places two fingers on the tank model.
1:4:33|1:4:37|Recalling this, [Zhang Li] touched the model and remained silent.
1:4:37|1:4:43|The scene cuts back to the armored vehicle, with Zheng Jin lying on the grass asleep, still holding a pair of binoculars in one hand.
1:4:43|1:4:50|After waking up, [Wang Xiaopo] quickly raised the binoculars to observe the situation. Seeing no one around, he stood up and ran over there with his legs spread.
1:4:50|1:4:57|On the other side of the armored vehicle, Wang Xiaopo was sleeping on a piece of tarp, one hand on his stomach and the other covering his eyes.
1:4:58|1:5:3|On the street, [Zheng Jin] nervously moves towards this direction, keeping an eye out for any signs of someone appearing.
1:5:6|1:5:10|As he approached quickly, he hurriedly took a few steps and bent down to take a look.
1:5:10|1:5:15|He held a telescope in one hand and, with the other hand open, took small steps to the position above [Wang Xiaopo]'s head.
1:5:15|1:5:21|With one foot stepping on a tree branch, he was about to fall, but quickly used one hand to support himself.
1:5:21|1:5:29|Wang Xiaopo woke up and took his foot out, leaning against the tree trunk with his body sideways, making noises with his mouth, observing how deeply Wang Xiaopo was sleeping.
1:5:34|1:5:48|Wang Xiaopo didn't move, with one hand holding onto the tree trunk and the other feeling under the rain cover. Not finding anything, he knelt down, carefully moving his other leg from behind the tree to the front, circling around from the top of Wang Xiaopo's head to his side.
1:5:48|1:5:59|While moving, he accidentally bumped into the leg of [Wang Xiaopo], who quickly propped himself up with one hand and raised the other, about to apologize out of habit. [Wang Xiaopo] shifted his leg and crossed his arms in front of his chest to shield his eyes.
1:6:0|1:6:11|Zhongjing sat on the ground, with his legs outstretched and his body leaning towards the rainproof cloth. He found that he couldn't exert any force, so he turned over and propped up his buttocks, kneeling and lying down.
1:6:11|1:6:22|He felt around under the armored vehicle, lifted one leg to reach out, suddenly stood up straight, confirmed the surroundings, then crawled forward two steps, legs inward, hiding completely under the car.
1:6:24|1:6:27|It turns out that it was Mrs. Zheng who rushed over from home.
1:6:27|1:6:33|She saw [Wang Xiaopo] asleep, standing beside her, kicking her with her foot.
1:6:36|1:6:41|[Wang Xiaopo] was woken up and stood up after rubbing his eyes with the back of his hand.
1:6:41|1:6:43|Mrs. Zheng points at herself.
1:6:45|1:6:48|Mrs. Zheng suddenly showed off and grabbed Wang Xiaopo's shirt pattern.
1:7:5|1:7:6|A police car happened to pass by.
1:7:6|1:7:8|Officer Zhang gets out of the car.
1:8:2|1:8:5|Officer Zhang quickly got into the car, waved towards Wang Xiaopo, and pointed straight with his index finger.
1:8:5|1:8:7|The scene shifts to the TV, where [Zhang Li] and her colleagues are watching the news.
1:8:27|1:8:30|On the other side, [Reporter Chen] walked into the office with bandages on his head.
1:8:52|1:8:54|Colleagues gathered around.
1:10:40|1:10:48|Stop telling me this, Xiaotang helped [Tan Limei] tidy up, she answered the phone.
1:10:53|1:10:55|She suddenly widened her eyes and stood up.
1:11:58|1:11:59|[Wang Xiaopo] points at himself.
1:12:2|1:12:3|Mrs. Zheng grabbed him again.
1:12:43|1:12:47|With one hand on his hip, [Wang Xiaopo] anxiously waited for the call to connect.
1:12:49|1:12:51|[Da Xu] is holding a cellphone in the hospital lobby.
1:13:0|1:13:5|He hung up the phone and immediately dialed again, looking down at the address book as he walked out.
1:13:5|1:13:10|Wang Xiaopo slightly stepped aside to let the nurse entering the door, then walked to the outside of the hospital, frowning and waiting for the other person to answer the phone.
1:13:10|1:13:11|He walked down the steps in front of the hospital, then slowed down his pace.
1:13:35|1:13:39|He listened while rolling his eyes.
1:13:47|1:13:49|[Da Xu] stood still, blinking his eyes incessantly.
1:13:54|1:13:55|Return to the side of the armored vehicle.
1:14:0|1:14:1|Wang Xiaopo's face immediately fell.
1:14:1|1:14:5|[Wang Xiaopo] rubbed his head, wrinkled his face, and suddenly sighed.
1:14:33|1:14:36|Mrs. Zheng saw him finish the call and pulled him aside.
1:14:44|1:14:51|The scene cuts to a place under a radio tower, with Wang Xiaopo holding a safety helmet and waiting. He sees a taxi and walks up to open the door.
1:14:51|1:14:53|[Wang Xiaopo] got out of the car and walked away.
1:14:54|1:14:55|He stopped and turned around.
1:15:1|1:15:7|In a blink of an eye, the two have climbed to the top of the tower, with [Wang Xiaopo] handing the insulator to his apprentice.
1:15:14|1:15:19|[Wang Xiaopo] reached for his phone with one hand, but accidentally dropped it.
1:15:19|1:15:24|The phone shattered into three pieces, and both of them looked down. [Wang Xiaopo] shouted angrily.
1:15:32|1:15:35|He turned his head while holding onto the iron tower with both hands, and then fiercely punched it.
1:15:35|1:15:39|On the other side, [Da Xu] rode his bicycle back to the repair shop.
1:16:0|1:16:1|Shen Yan stopped Da Xu and asked.
1:16:1|1:16:3|Reporter Chen is taking photos.
1:16:9|1:16:10|Shen Yan nodded.
1:16:11|1:16:13|Reporter Chen looked around.
1:16:42|1:16:47|An aunt rushed up, questioned, turned around and left, and the old man with a beard followed out in confusion.
1:17:14|1:17:19|Uncle Wu pointed at the iron tower in a daze, while Aunt Shunzhi looked over.
1:17:19|1:17:30|At this moment, [Da Xu] rode his bicycle back to the roadside where the armored vehicle was parked. He got off and pointed at [Mrs. Zheng], who took a step back nervously.
1:18:19|1:18:20|[Da Xu] fiddled around.
1:18:26|1:18:31|You... you... [Da Xu] touched his nose and looked around.
1:18:44|1:18:48|He took two steps towards the rear of the car.
1:18:48|1:18:52|Saying that, he took out his phone, swiped the screen, and started dialing.
1:18:52|1:18:56|Mrs. Zheng was still pulling at the branches from behind, trying to remove them.
1:18:56|1:19:0|[Da Xu] put the phone to his ear, but no one answered.
1:19:0|1:19:2|After turning around, he said to [Mrs. Zheng].
1:19:6|1:19:10|He called [Zhang Li] again, and she answered the phone at the sales department entrance.
1:19:59|1:20:12|[Da Xu] frowned at the screen of his phone, while [Zhang Li] returned to the front desk and closed her flip phone.
1:20:12|1:20:17|He leaned his arm on the table, his gaze shifting to the tank model he had just taken out, reminiscing.
1:20:50|1:20:56|He recalled what Wang Xiaopo had said, and thought of Da Xu's words, then he opened his phone and dialed a number.
1:20:56|1:21:4|After waiting for a while, he closed his phone and frowned, poking the tank model with his index finger.
1:21:4|1:21:9|The scene cuts back to the armored vehicle, where Mrs. Zheng continues to struggle to move the branches.
1:21:9|1:21:11|At this moment, journalist [Zhang Li] and [Da Xu] walked over.
1:21:17|1:21:25|Both of them looked at the armored vehicle in surprise. [Da Xu] took out a camera from his bag to take a picture, while [Officer Zhang] pulled out his phone and turned to answer a call.
1:21:29|1:21:32|[Da Xu] stopped taking photos and turned to Officer Zhang's side.
1:21:48|1:21:50|Mrs. Zheng squatted on the ground, listening as well.
1:22:1|1:22:3|Mrs. Zheng leaned in.
1:22:57|1:23:8|Someone is waiting for the sun with one hand, someone has their hands on their hips, and others are talking. Everyone's eyes are focused on the iron tower. Behind the crowd, the police car has arrived.
1:23:8|1:23:11|Officer Zhang pushed through the crowd, followed closely by his colleagues.
1:23:14|1:23:17|The three police officers [Officer Zhang and his brother] pushed the crowd backward.
1:23:17|1:23:23|Officer Zhang faced the iron tower, looked up at it, took the megaphone from his colleague's hand, and adjusted it.
1:23:30|1:23:32|The figure on the iron tower started to move.
1:25:11|1:25:12|The fire truck drove over and stopped.
1:25:23|1:25:32|Officer Zhang's voice gradually weakened.
1:25:32|1:25:35|Beside the car at the Zhuang family's house, Mrs. Zheng finally pulled out the bag from the Zhuang family's house.
1:25:44|1:25:51|Mrs. Zheng took out money wrapped in paper from her bag, Shen Yan patted Reporter Chen, and Mrs. Zheng took out a stack of money.
1:26:32|1:26:35|In the lean meat department, [Zhang Li] looks at the report.
1:26:38|1:26:40|[Da Xu] answers the phone.
1:26:40|1:26:48|His one arm was leaning against the car, holding a phone in one hand, blinking his eyes while listening to [Zhang Li].
1:26:48|1:26:54|His body straightened up a bit, and his eyes quickly darted around.
1:27:8|1:27:16|Reporter Chen dragged [Zhang Li] over, while she and Officer Zhang quickly ran out and anxiously set off to find [Wang Xiaopo].
1:27:16|1:27:18|Next to the iron tower, the elevator has already risen.
1:27:20|1:27:29|[Wang Xiaopo] looked at the elevator slowly approaching, with two firefighters wearing helmets on top looking at him. He opened his mouth and turned his head, feeling very helpless.
1:27:52|1:27:57|The helicopter slowly descends, and on the ground, [Zhang Li] is about to cross the police line.
1:27:59|1:28:1|[Da Xu] rushes directly towards the blind beggar's home.
1:28:45|1:28:53|Da Xu drove the armored vehicle quickly, while Chen, pretending to be a reporter, leaned out of the car roof and waved to the passersby.
1:28:53|1:29:4|At the intersection just passed by the armored vehicle, a young man riding a bicycle turned the corner. However, a grease powder fell from the scaffolding next to him onto his head, causing the young man to lose his direction and cry as he fell onto the chess table of two elderly people.
1:29:6|1:29:11|An auntie on the second floor was walking towards the car, but her bright underwear was caught by the armored vehicle and taken away.
1:29:11|1:29:17|Reporter Chen, completely unaware, stood on the roof of the car, first clasping his hands in a fist and then waving, smiling happily.
1:29:17|1:29:25|Kids on the street chasing after the armored vehicle, a few stopped to watch a young man fall, two old men playing chess grabbing the young man with oil all over his head.
1:29:26|1:29:30|The armored vehicle under the bed has already taken another route.
1:29:30|1:29:34|On the wide road by the river, the armored vehicle slowly drives on the non-motorized lane.
1:29:34|1:29:39|The police car caught up, turned at the intersection, and forced the armored vehicle to stop.
1:29:39|1:29:45|Reporter Chen made a stop gesture above, and Officer Zhang and Wang Xiaopo got off the car one after another, while Da Xu hurried over.
1:30:17|1:30:24|On the other side, [Zheng Jin] was at home, sitting on the sofa with a frown on his forehead, holding a newspaper and flipping it back and forth.
1:30:24|1:30:30|At this moment, Mrs. Zheng pushed open the door, Zheng Jin closed the newspaper and busily got up, flipping over from between the two sofas, and asked.
1:30:40|1:30:45|Mrs. Zheng sat wearily on the sofa, while Zheng Jin massaged her shoulders.
1:30:48|1:30:49|[Zheng Jin] bent down and asked.
1:30:53|1:30:55|Zheng Jin thought for a moment.
1:30:56|1:30:58|[Mrs. Zheng] rolled her eyes.
1:31:2|1:31:12|Money is an unknown thing, as long as our family's Wang Xiaopo comes back safely, stops massaging properly, sits back on the sofa, and Mrs. Zheng looks at him without saying a word.
1:31:12|1:31:15|At this point, Officer Zhang has already taken everyone back to the police station.
1:31:19|1:31:21|Daughter [Zhang Li] stood at the far right and spoke.
1:32:0|1:32:3|Reporter Chen nodded as he wrote in his notebook.
1:32:24|1:32:30|Officer Zhang said to his newly arrived colleague that Zhang Li wanted to educate her father, but Officer Zhang had already walked out.
1:32:42|1:32:51|On the other side, [Zheng Jin] in pajamas can be seen squatting next to the street lamp, picking up the plastic bag underneath, all of which is seen by [Mrs. Zheng].
1:32:51|1:33:0|[Zheng Jin] opened the plastic bag, took out the money and tucked it into her bosom, all the while glancing around to see if anyone was watching. Then she tiptoed back home.
1:33:2|1:33:10|[Mrs. Zheng] was already lying on the bed. [Zheng Jin] carefully approached the bedside and sat down, took off his glasses, and slowly lay down on the bed.
1:33:10|1:33:16|She scratched her arms, rubbed the corners of her eyes, and then touched the wound on her neck.
1:33:16|1:33:24|Mrs. Zheng then turned her head to look at her, smirked, rolled over, and pulled up one side of the blanket to cover her.
1:33:29|1:33:32|The camera pans up to a photo of the two on the wall above the head of the bed.
1:33:32|1:33:45|In the group photo, Zheng Jin sits with a puppy-like pose, with both hands placed like claws on his chest, while [Mrs. Zheng] has her hands resting on her shoulders, and their heads are leaning against each other.
1:33:45|1:33:50|Back at the police station, Officer Zhang walks in.
1:34:34|1:34:37|After speaking, [Da Xu] shrugged and walked out.
1:34:40|1:34:43|Let's go, pulling him out.
1:34:48|1:34:53|Upon entering, the journalists interviewing [Zheng Jin] saw Wang Xiaopo running up one after another.
1:34:56|1:34:58|Wang Xiaopo lowered his head and thought for a moment before saying.
1:35:40|1:36:6|But I think, as long as we have the determination and work hard to pursue our dreams, they will come true. [Zhang Li] also holds [Wang Xiaopo]'s hand. My mom always worries that you can't give me a happy and safe home. Indeed, you don't have a big house or a good job. The two embrace tightly, and the people around them applaud.
1:36:24|1:36:31|The scene cuts to a grassy field, with the applause of the crowd, the bride, carrying the train of her wedding dress, slowly walks up the steps.
1:36:31|1:36:36|Officer Zhang is linking arms with his daughter, showing his teeth, and smiling happily.
1:36:36|1:36:44|The armored vehicle is parked in the front left of the carpet, while the groom Wang Xiaopo is waiting for his bride, quietly adjusting his suit.
1:36:44|1:36:48|Officer Zhang hands Zhang Li's hand to Wang Xiaopo, and the two exchange a glance.
