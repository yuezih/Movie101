0:0:53|0:1:6|Jumping onto a rooftop, with a thunderbolt flashing across the sky, [Clown] instantly transformed into a real person. Holding a broken makeup mirror in his hand, he grimly touched up his makeup, then suddenly turned his head, his eyes looking terrifying.
0:1:8|0:1:14|The [clown] in this film is the male lead, young man [Zheng Kaisi] from the small town.
0:1:23|0:1:41|A metallic pentagram floats in the air, with its surface texture infinitely magnified, resembling the ravines in the mountains. The gleam on the metal surface shimmers under the light, as if possessing a magical power, attracting everyone to fight for it, stirring up a bloody storm.
0:1:55|0:2:3|In a dimly lit hall, a man is being dragged away on the ground. A group of monsters are fighting each other with long knives, creating a bloody and eerie scene.
0:2:29|0:2:40|In the hall, two people are arguing about something, but the shadows of the two on the wall have turned into two monsters fighting, with one being killed by a knife. Outside the chaotic hall,
0:2:40|0:2:49|A giant cruise ship slowly sails on the sea, with lights shining towards the stormy night and the vast ocean ahead.
0:2:49|0:2:57|Above the ship, several seagulls flew by, and following their gaze, a helicopter landed above the deck.
0:3:21|0:3:41|With that, the clown in the animation appeared again, his laughter eerie and sinister, holding a sharp knife as he approached a man from behind. The man had the number 017 imprinted on his neck. Without any hesitation, the clown struck with the knife, blood splattering everywhere, a triumphant and maniacal smile blooming on his face.
0:3:41|0:3:50|Frozen on the TV screen. In the arcade, [Zheng Kaisi] dressed as a [clown], staring blankly at the clown doll in the glass cabinet.
0:3:50|0:3:59|A colleague rushed over from a short distance away, slapped his shoulder hard, and said, "Zheng Kaisi" was taken aback.
0:4:9|0:4:14|[Zheng Kaisi] gave his colleague a cold look, stood up reluctantly, and his colleague behind him was so angry that he wanted to hit him.
0:4:14|0:4:22|[Zheng Kaisi] took a photo with the customer expressionlessly, then handed the phone to a colleague and walked away confidently.
0:4:23|0:4:35|[Zheng Kaisi] sat in front of the game machine, just inserted the game coin, when suddenly a few popcorns hit him on the head.
0:4:35|0:4:38|He turned his head and saw his childhood friend sitting not far away, smiling at him.
0:4:40|0:4:51|[Li Jun]. [Li Jun]'s smile suddenly froze, blood vessels appeared on his face instantly, his body uncontrollably swayed, and his chin suddenly inflated like a balloon.
0:4:51|0:4:55|Transformed into a long-eared big-headed monster under the terrified gaze of [Zheng Kaisi].
0:4:55|0:5:0|At the same time, the same thing is happening on the subway in the city.
0:5:0|0:5:22|Passengers mutated like [Li Jun], with long-eared big-headed monsters, long-necked flat-headed monsters, and octagonal-headed monsters filling the entire carriage. [Zheng Kaisi] had two knives inserted behind him, suddenly appearing on the rooftop of a building. With one foot on the edge of the rooftop, he ran forward with the help of the force, shuttling freely between the buildings at rocket-like speed.
0:5:22|0:5:44|In front of a towering skyscraper, amidst the fast-flowing traffic, [Zheng Kaisi] leaps into the air with inertia, striking a pose before gracefully landing in the subway car. Without even getting up, he swiftly deals with two passengers about to mutate. The entire car of monsters stares at [Zheng Kaisi] hungrily, but he remains calm and easily evades them.
0:5:44|0:5:55|Dodging one of their attacks, he turned to look at them, his expression full of provocation. With two knives in hand, he took down one with each strike, instantly knocking down a large group. A head of an octagonal monster flew towards him.
0:5:55|0:6:5|[Zheng Kaisi] dodged backwards, killing him with one stroke, then did a side somersault, landing steadily without any slack, and continued to fight forward.
0:6:5|0:6:27|He kicked open the door of another carriage, and suddenly heard the monster's panting behind him. He turned around abruptly, kicked it out of the window, and then engaged in a fight with the next monster in the carriage. [Zheng Kaisi] had lost his sanity in the frenzy of killing, eagerly slaying every monster that came rushing towards him, fighting his way through carriage after carriage.
0:6:27|0:6:38|In an instant, blood splattered everywhere, and all that could be seen were severed limbs. The subway was speeding along, but it couldn't match the speed of the slaughter by Zheng Kaisi.
0:6:38|0:6:45|Terrifying and menacing. The next moment, all of this vanished with the clapping of [Li Jun].
0:8:42|0:8:49|[Li Jun] was suddenly speechless, his expression becoming unnatural, and [Zheng Kaisi] ignored him.
0:8:49|0:8:53|He walked to the side and wiped the oil paint off his face in the mirror.
0:8:53|0:9:0|At the same time, the broadcast in the mall sounded, indicating that the business hours were about to end.
0:9:0|0:9:10|The next day, [Zheng Kaisi] sat by his mother's sickbed, playing a mobile game. The sunlight shone through the window onto his mother's peaceful face, everything was calm as usual.
0:9:11|0:9:27|Nurse Liu Qing walked in with medication in hand, ready to change the IV for another patient. When [Zheng Kaisi] saw her, he immediately put away his phone and kept his gaze on her, not looking away. Liu Qing felt [Zheng Kaisi] staring at her, glanced at him, and decided not to pay him any attention.
0:9:27|0:9:36|[Zheng Kaisi] took a candy from the small iron box and threw it into his mouth. Then he stood up, casually broke the flowers in front of someone else's bed, and walked out.
0:9:36|0:9:38|Liu Qing finished the IV drip, turned his head and followed him out.
0:9:42|0:9:48|[Zheng Kaisi], with a flower in his mouth, blocked Liu Qing's way, but Liu Qing remained expressionless.
0:9:49|0:9:56|Liu Qing agilely dodged around [Zheng Kaisi] and walked straight ahead. [Zheng Kaisi] hurriedly caught up and took out the flower from his mouth to hand it to Liu Qing.
0:9:57|0:9:59|Liu Qing asked in frustration.
0:10:28|0:10:30|Liu Qing became increasingly impatient and turned to the disinfection room.
0:10:31|0:10:40|[Zheng Kaisi] followed persistently and leaned against the door, watching her.
0:11:0|0:11:6|The patient deliberately lifted his buttocks, and the people around laughed.
0:11:23|0:11:30|Liu Qing stared at him. [Zheng Kaisi] was stunned, speechless.
0:11:32|0:11:42|Seeing [Zheng Kaisi] remain silent, Liu Qing gave him a cold look and then walked into the ward.
0:11:45|0:11:53|Zheng Kaisi's anger could no longer be contained, the clown inside him seemed to have emerged, grabbing a saline bottle and charging in.
0:12:3|0:12:6|The patient next to him was scared and fainted.
0:12:6|0:12:12|Liu Qing rushed forward to rescue, the ward was in chaos and confusion.
0:12:12|0:12:16|The nurse finished bandaging the wound on [Zheng Kaisi]'s hand and then turned away, ignoring him.
0:12:17|0:12:34|[Zheng Kaisi] stood up and walked towards the corridor, feeling uncomfortable with the bandage on his hand, he couldn't help but fidget. Suddenly he stopped, and upon closer inspection, he saw that his mother's bed had been moved to the corridor. He hurried to the door of the ward, only to find that the previous bed had been taken by someone else.
0:12:34|0:12:43|He instantly understood and turned to run towards the nurse's station.
0:13:38|0:13:42|Listening to the conversation between [Zheng Kaisi] and [Li Jun], he ultimately didn't have the courage to barge in. He understood that he had dragged down [Liu Qing]. In the hospital at night,
0:13:42|0:13:50|In the silence, [Zheng Kaisi] sat by his mother's bed, just opened a box of instant noodles, only to find the kettle empty. Just then,
0:13:50|0:14:0|Liu Qing suddenly appeared. Looking at the lunchbox handed by Liu Qing, [Zheng Kaisi] stubbornly said.
0:14:16|0:14:23|[Zheng Kaisi] refused for the first time. Liu Qing's hand froze in mid-air for a long time, then,
0:14:23|0:14:29|Put the money on the bedside table, then turn around to help [Zheng Kaisi]'s mother make the bed.
0:14:29|0:14:35|[Zheng Kaisi] noticed the name tag bag placed by the bed.
0:14:46|0:14:54|He paused and said, [Li Jun] stopped what he was doing, stunned for a moment,
0:14:54|0:15:6|She turned her head to look at the unusual Zheng Kaisi walking towards her, looking down at him. Zheng Kaisi raised his head in confusion, staring straight at Liu Qing.
0:15:7|0:15:17|Liu Qing's eyes were filled with tears, unwilling to say more, under Zheng Kaisi's gaze, she turned and left. She made a tough statement for herself, but unknowingly,
0:15:17|0:15:22|Humility has reached the dust. [Zheng Kaisi]'s stubborn self-esteem has hurt both himself and [Li Jun].
0:15:24|0:15:32|He had to compromise in the face of reality. He breathed a sigh of relief only after watching [Li Qing] leave, then lowered his head to eat dumplings heartily.
0:15:32|0:15:48|Worn out until now, he finally realized how passive he was, how vulnerable he was. Everything that happened today, his mother was treated unfairly, [Li Jun] endured humiliation and burdens for himself, each incident stabbed into his heart like a knife.
0:15:49|0:15:54|He suddenly stood up, pulled a chair and sat by [Zheng Kaisi's Mother]'s bed, with a sense of grievance and unwillingness.
0:16:20|0:16:30|[Zheng Kaisi] couldn't help but burst into tears, covering his mouth and trembling uncontrollably. [Zheng Kaisi's Mother] showed no response, but a smile remained on her face.
0:16:30|0:16:39|[Zheng Kaisi] calmed down a bit and said. He casually wiped the tears on his face with his bandaged hand, his eyes,
0:16:39|0:16:46|He gradually became firm, as if he had made a decision, and got up to walk outside. He stood on the rooftop at the end of the corridor.
0:16:47|0:16:48|Dialed [Li Jun]'s number.
0:16:58|0:17:9|The next day, Li Jun rushed to the hospital eagerly, and the two sat by Zheng Kaisi's Mother's bedside.
0:17:10|0:17:19|[Zheng Kaisi] pressed his mother's hand for a fingerprint, but still couldn't rest assured.
0:17:25|0:17:39|[Zheng Kaisi] stared into [Li Jun]'s eyes, just as he was about to take out the house deed, [Li Jun] hurriedly snatched it away.
0:17:45|0:17:47|[Li Jun] turned and left after speaking.
0:17:47|0:17:57|[Zheng Kaisi], although skeptical, chose to trust [Li Jun] because of their years of friendship and his bedridden mother in urgent need of money.
0:17:57|0:18:12|A strange man stood straight in front of the nurse's station, wearing a leather jacket, with tattoos on his cheeks, chin, neck, and even a small braid on his head. [Li Jun] saw him and ran over, handing over the contract and house deed to him.
0:18:12|0:18:25|[Zheng Kaisi] looked at the man and felt increasingly strange. Although the man was wearing sunglasses, his expression was cold and stern, even causing Liu Qing beside him to cast a curious glance.
0:18:25|0:18:35|[Zheng Kaisi] left the hospital, rode his motorcycle onto the overpass, and raced all the way to a small alley. He stopped in front of a convenience store and said to the owner behind the counter.
0:18:37|0:18:44|The boss kept his head down playing a mobile game without saying a word, until [Zheng Kaisi] threw the money onto the counter, then he slowly started to move.
0:18:44|0:18:53|[Zheng Kaisi] took out a candy box from his pocket, just as he put the candy in his mouth, he saw a shadow on the glass cabinet in front of him, someone was following him.
0:18:53|0:19:3|The strange man from the hospital before now appears behind [Zheng Kaisi]. When he is discovered, he quickly pulls down his helmet, starts the motorcycle, and drives forward to catch up with [Zheng Kaisi].
0:19:3|0:19:13|As they passed by each other, [Zheng Kaisi] looked puzzled and stared at the man intently, feeling that something was amiss, until the owner of the convenience store slammed the cigarette case heavily on the counter.
0:19:37|0:19:42|He glanced at the dirty-faced [Meng Xiaopang] next to the old grandmother and then turned away.
0:19:42|0:19:46|The old lady stood still, clutching the money, her eyes shining.
0:19:49|0:19:59|At night, [Zheng Kaisi] stood on the rooftop of the hospital ward, repeatedly calling [Li Jun] but no one answered.
0:19:59|0:20:6|He lit a cigarette by the air conditioner on the rooftop, trying to forget all the troubles and anxieties.
0:20:6|0:20:10|Looking at the distant twinkling streetlights, he couldn't help but fall into contemplation. In the blink of an eye, the sky brightened.
0:20:37|0:20:40|Li Jun's panicked voice completely extinguished Zheng Kaisi's drowsiness.
0:20:40|0:20:50|The moment crushed his strength. He seemed to hear the sound of his heart beating violently, everything around him began to spin, the surrounding sounds.
0:20:50|0:21:10|It's as if magnified countless times, swirling around his ears, the jumping pen tip in the hands of [Doctor], the water accidentally spilled by the patient's family, the wind-up doll in the clown's hand, the speeding subway, the black-clothed man who suddenly burst into the house when he was a child, the needle piercing the skin, the rotten apple, the effervescent tablet in the water cup, the patient being rescued,
0:21:10|0:21:17|The second hand on the clock. The sound lingered in his ears like a curse.
0:21:17|0:21:24|The rain was pouring down as he arrived at the entrance of Li Jun's company, still unable to recover his senses.
0:21:44|0:21:52|[Zheng Kaisi] took out his phone, the screen displaying an unknown location.
0:21:56|0:22:2|[Zheng Kaisi] stood up and walked to the window on the left, pulling open the blinds slightly.
0:22:2|0:22:11|Looking out, he saw the man with tattoos on his face standing across the street, staring at him with a cold and eerie gaze.
0:22:11|0:22:17|The scene cuts to [Zheng Kaisi] being blindfolded, taken by a man to a dimly lit basement.
0:22:17|0:22:25|In a spacious hall, an old man sat in a chair with his back to the two people. The man removed Zheng Kaisi's headgear, and the old man turned around and spoke.
0:22:31|0:22:36|The man on the side puts a wireless earpiece into his ear.
0:24:8|0:24:15|Seeing no reaction from [Zheng Kaisi], Anderson spoke. [Zheng Kaisi] pondered for a moment,
0:24:17|0:24:26|Ando excitedly pushes Zheng Kaisi back into his seat.
0:24:26|0:24:34|Anderson walked over, forcing him to look ahead. The screens on the wall started playing a video.
0:24:37|0:24:44|In the scene, [Li Jun] is being chased and forced to the ground, where he is made to leave his fingerprint on a piece of paper.
0:26:0|0:26:6|Anderson rubbed his chin and said. Then he reached out to the clock beside him.
0:26:18|0:26:25|Anderson placed his finger by his lips, interrupting Zheng Kaisi's question, signaling to him that time was ticking away.
0:26:25|0:26:32|[Zheng Kaisi] looked at the clock and suddenly felt disoriented. Liu Qing's face appeared in front of his eyes.
0:26:38|0:26:46|[Zheng Kaisi's Mother] lying in the hallway, Liu Qing's back as he walked away, kept appearing in Zheng Kaisi's mind, haunting him.
0:26:46|0:26:52|The time has come, Anderson presses the button on the alarm clock, ready to take away the contract on the table.
0:26:52|0:27:2|[Zheng Kaisi] held onto the contract, lowered his head without saying a word, and looked at [Anderson]. [Anderson] tactfully handed the pen to [Zheng Kaisi], as if he had already anticipated the outcome.
0:27:2|0:27:17|Seeing [Zheng Kaisi] sign his name, [Anderson] smiled and said. His head was covered again with a hood, and [Zheng Kaisi] was sent back. Arriving at the hospital, [Zheng Kaisi] dragged [Li Jun], who was working, to the rest area and said.
0:27:54|0:27:57|Liu Qing angrily slapped Zheng Kaisi.
0:27:57|0:28:5|[Zheng Kaisi] put away his smile, looked at [Liu Qing] seriously, took out the hand-knitted bracelet and placed it in [Liu Qing]'s hand.
0:28:8|0:28:13|[Liu Qing] looked up, puzzled, at [Zheng Kaisi]. [Zheng Kaisi] avoided eye contact.
0:28:30|0:28:47|Liu Qing grabbed Zheng Kaisi's collar, his voice trembling constantly, as Zheng Kaisi slowly spoke.
0:29:17|0:29:26|After [Liu Qing] left, [Zheng Kaisi] stood foolishly in place, tears of helplessness swirling in his eyes. He then approached [Zheng Kaisi's Mother]'s bedside and placed his hand on hers.
0:29:26|0:29:41|Ando suddenly appeared at the corridor, Zheng Kaisi knew he was running out of time, so he patted Zheng Kaisi's Mother's hand, picked up the bag, and walked outside. Soon he and over a dozen other game participants were taken to an underground parking lot.
0:29:41|0:29:45|Ando scans their documents with a few men in black.
0:29:51|0:29:57|Ando commanded the black-clad men beside him to take out a box.
0:30:2|0:30:10|The man in black didn't hesitate to forcefully insert the needle into the neck of a man in the front row.
0:30:10|0:30:15|The man groaned in pain. After the injection, he immediately fell into a deep sleep.
0:30:15|0:30:22|Dragged away by another man in black and put into a car. The crowd started to stir, everyone panicking and bumping into each other.
0:30:22|0:30:33|Only one man in a white suit remained calm and indifferent, looking at the crowd. A fly flew past [Zheng Kaisi], and the sound of its wings flapping was amplified countless times in an instant.
0:30:33|0:30:45|Zheng Kaisi's gaze followed the shadow of a fly to the side. Unconsciously, the man in black was already standing in front of him, preparing the syringe. Zheng Kaisi, however, grabbed the syringe in his hand.
0:30:45|0:30:54|Thrust out, pushing away the person next to him and turning to run, several men in black hurriedly chased after. [Zheng Kaisi] tried to pull open the car door beside him, but it wouldn't budge.
0:30:54|0:31:0|After probing one by one, he finally found an unlocked car and quickly got into the driver's seat.
0:31:0|0:31:6|He dared not hesitate, skillfully started the engine. The engine roared, ready to go.
0:31:6|0:31:13|The next moment, the car was speeding wildly on the main road of the parking lot, and several men in black were not to be trifled with.
0:31:13|0:31:22|Rode a motorcycle and chased after them immediately. For a moment, the parking lot was filled with dust, chaos, and the sound of tires rolling over the ground.
0:31:22|0:31:29|Deafening. [Zheng Kaisi] raced all the way, drove across the overpass, and arrived in the tunnel. And behind him, the men in black clothes,
0:31:29|0:31:39|Relentlessly pursuing, completely disregarding traffic rules and the vehicles on the road. A figure in black gradually accelerated towards Zheng Kaisi's car. Zheng Kaisi, quick-witted,
0:31:39|0:31:49|Pushed against the wall, the man in black couldn't hold on for long. In the next moment, he fell to the ground with his car, and was then rolled under the big truck behind him.
0:31:49|0:32:0|A huge fire ignited in an instant. Before he could even catch his breath, another figure in black gradually approached, agilely weaving through the wheels. Even as [Zheng Kaisi] kept stepping hard on the gas pedal.
0:32:0|0:32:8|The men in black caught up. Between them was a large truck, and [Zheng Kaisi] did not notice the men in black trying to overtake.
0:32:8|0:32:30|The man in black was waiting at the front of the car, ready to strike. He aimed at the car window of [Zheng Kaisi], and a steel wire flew out from the back of his hand, shattering the glass and hooking onto [Zheng Kaisi]'s seat. [Zheng Kaisi] was terrified, only then did he see the man in black not far away. He panicked and stepped on the brakes, causing the steel wire to wrap around the front of a large truck. The man in black then threw down the motorcycle and flew in place, pulling on the steel wire.
0:32:30|0:32:42|The truck's window crashed straight towards [Zheng Kaisi], at this moment, the truck burst into flames, instantly engulfing the vehicle. After the thick smoke cleared, the man in black and [Zheng Kaisi] were wrestling inside the car.
0:32:42|0:32:51|Shortly after, [Zheng Kaisi] exerted all his strength to kick the man in black along with the car door out. As he drove out of the tunnel, the terrified [Zheng Kaisi],
0:32:51|0:33:14|In a panic, in order to avoid the oncoming vehicles, he violently turned the steering wheel, broke through the guardrail of the overpass, and landed on the street below the bridge. Pedestrians were scared and fled in all directions. Unexpectedly, a black man suddenly appeared outside the car window, and with one arm smashed the glass. [Zheng Kaisi] also didn't hesitate to crash into the man in black. The man in black lost his balance, fell to the ground, and the motorcycle flew out of control, crashing into the side of the street.
0:33:14|0:33:26|In the barbershop window, before the people inside could react, they were knocked down by a huge impact and splashing glass shards. In the ruins, a fly flew out, rapidly flapping its wings.
0:33:26|0:33:37|Fleeing into the next room, passing through the bustling kitchen, the lively restaurant, the busy construction site, in the blink of an eye arrived in front of [Zheng Kaisi].
0:33:37|0:33:44|[Zheng Kaisi] fixed his gaze on the fly, while the black-clad figure in front of him was preparing a new syringe.
0:33:44|0:33:47|Zheng Kaisi's fantasy in his mind comes to a sudden halt.
0:33:47|0:34:3|Just as the man in black was about to make a move, [Zheng Kaisi] knocked his syringe out of his hand and ran forward according to his own plan. [Ando] and his men, however, remained calm, picked up a nearby syringe gun, aimed at [Zheng Kaisi], and hit him with a single shot.
0:34:3|0:34:14|[Zheng Kaisi] stood still, removed the needle from his neck, turned his head to look at [Ando], but his vision was getting blurry. When he regained consciousness, [Zheng Kaisi] found himself
0:34:14|0:34:34|Boarding the ship, pushed by men in black, locked in a cell, a rough man in black imprints a number, 078, on [Zheng Kaisi]'s neck. The iron door of the cell slowly closes, and as [Zheng Kaisi] looks up, he sees several unfamiliar faces staring at him. He looks around in panic at the players in the room.
0:34:34|0:34:46|Filled with caution, under the gaze of several people, [Zheng Kaisi] carefully moved to the wall, where a round glass window was mounted. He wiped the dirt off the glass with his hand.
0:34:46|0:34:58|Looking out the window, what came into view was the boundless sea and the endless night. A huge cruise ship sailed on the sea, its whistle emitting a majestic roar.
0:34:58|0:35:8|The structure of the ship is very complex, looking like a building when viewed from afar, towering into the sky. The top of the cabin is made of glass, and the lights inside the ship shine out, illuminating the entire ship.
0:35:10|0:35:20|A halo envelops, particularly striking in the dark night, as if possessing a mysterious power that attracts people to explore. The cruise ship is like a steel behemoth.
0:35:20|0:35:22|Heading towards the distance,
0:35:22|0:35:33|At the stern of the ship, the words "Fate" are written. At this moment, [Zheng Kaisi] and the players on the ship have fallen into a deep sleep, embarking on an unknown journey with Fate.
0:35:33|0:35:41|Facing them is a tough battle. [Zheng Kaisi] and the others were awakened by the sound of the ship's whistle, and a message began to play on the broadcast.
0:35:53|0:36:5|The broadcast was playing on a loop, and the prison doors were opened. The people walked out of the rows of cells and flooded out.
0:36:5|0:36:15|In the aisle, at the end of the aisle is the door leading to the hall. Everyone walked towards the hall following the light, and the men in black at the door handed each person a cloth bag as they entered the hall.
0:36:16|0:36:26|[Zheng Kaisi] and the others were all stunned. This place was like a huge casino, with the hall filled with gambling tables, each with a referee standing beside it. The building had a retro and old-fashioned European style.
0:36:26|0:36:30|Accompanied by the crisscrossing steel frames,
0:36:30|0:36:36|It's very eerie. Looking up, a huge cage hangs in the center of the hall, inside
0:39:6|0:39:13|The crowd looked towards [Anderson], eagerly wanting to get an answer. [Anderson] raised an eyebrow and slowly spoke.
0:39:23|0:39:32|Filled with disdain and contempt, everyone looked at each other in panic. [Anderson] continued.
0:40:13|0:40:25|Anderson's words had just fallen, and the countdown clock on the side started ticking down, showing 3 hours, 59 minutes, and 59 seconds. The ship slowly sailed towards the open sea.
0:40:25|0:40:32|The fate of the group of desperados on the ship is about to be rekindled on this [Destiny].
0:40:32|0:40:42|The crowd dispersed, some couldn't wait to get to the gambling table, [Zheng Kaisi] panicked, looking around in confusion. The man at the nearby gambling table lost all his chips.
0:40:42|0:40:45|The man screamed miserably as he was dragged into a room.
0:40:45|0:40:56|He struggled desperately, waving his unwilling hands. The broadcast was reporting the elimination of the man. The one who defeated him was the man in the white suit from before, number 29.
0:40:56|0:41:5|A hand was placed on Zheng Kaisi's shoulder. Zheng Kaisi stared at the person in front of him and nodded.
0:42:34|0:42:38|[Zheng Kaisi] understood what [Zhang Jingkun] meant, but hesitated in place.
0:42:38|0:42:47|[Zhang Jingkun] patted his back and walked away. At this moment, the broadcast sounded again, and another person was eliminated. [Zheng Kaisi] stared at [Zhang Jingkun]'s back, and in the end,
0:42:47|0:42:49|Take a gamble.
0:42:49|0:43:0|[Zheng Kaisi] found table number 6, walked over, [Li Jun] was sitting on a nearby sofa. When he saw [Zheng Kaisi], he leisurely got up and walked over, nodding at [Zheng Kaisi].
0:43:0|0:43:11|[Zheng Kaisi] couldn't let his guard down as he looked into his eyes, but [Li Jun] maintained a serious expression, trying to dispel [Zheng Kaisi]'s doubts.
0:43:11|0:43:28|[Zheng Kaisi] took out a card, and Zhang Jingkun also took out a card without hesitation and placed it face down on the table. However, [Zheng Kaisi] held the card in his hand, as if going through a great mental struggle before slowly placing the card on top. The man in black turned over Zhang Jingkun's card, revealing a scissors.
0:44:3|0:44:15|The joy was beyond words as he played the cards in the order agreed upon by the two of them, and in a blink of an eye, only two cards were left. But at that moment, the man in black turned to Zhang Jingkun and said.
0:44:15|0:44:23|Both of them froze at the same time, looking down at the gambling table. Zhang Jingkun, who was supposed to play scissors, unexpectedly played rock.
0:44:23|0:44:30|Zhang Jingkun slapped his own head in frustration and pulled [Zheng Kaisi] aside.
0:44:42|0:44:54|[Zheng Kaisi] stared at Zhang Jingkun, looking at his remorseful expression, and chose to believe him. The two returned to the gambling table, where Zhang Jingkun took out a card and showed the pattern on it to [Zheng Kaisi].
0:44:58|0:45:7|[Zheng Kaisi] had a cold expression, with a fierce look in his eyes. The trust they had just established moments ago instantly shattered.
0:45:7|0:45:13|The referee turned over the cards of the two, only to find that the pair of scissors Zhang Jingkun had just shown to himself,
0:45:13|0:45:20|At this moment, it turned into a piece of cloth, and the black man turned to [Zheng Kaisi] and said. Zhang Jingkun showed a sinister smile.
0:45:20|0:45:28|Picking up the cards, trying to make [Zheng Kaisi] understand clearly, he is like a magician, the cards changing patterns in his hands at will.
0:45:31|0:45:33|[Zheng Kaisi] has lost his mind.
0:45:33|0:45:40|A group of men in black approached and pinned him to the table, forcibly took his second star off, and handed it to [Zhang Jingkun].
0:45:55|0:46:4|[Zhang Jingkun] finished speaking, got up and put the stars he won on his arms, then left. [Zheng Kaisi] glared at [Zhang Jingkun] fiercely, struggling desperately to get up.
0:46:4|0:46:16|He was firmly held down by the man in black. It wasn't until Zhang Jingkun walked away that the man in black released him. Beads of sweat rolled down Zheng Kaisi's forehead, and when he stood up, he seemed to have lost his soul.
0:46:16|0:46:18|Walking slowly and leisurely, [Zheng Kaisi] moved forward.
0:46:18|0:46:30|But he didn't know where to go. The man beside him was being dragged forward by the men in black, the screams piercing [Zheng Kaisi]'s ears, the repeated blows crushing [Zheng Kaisi]'s hope.
0:46:30|0:46:46|Completely shattered, he was once again plagued by hallucinations. The sudden dizziness made it hard for him to breathe. He took off the translator by his ear, closed his eyes, and pinched the bridge of his nose hard to force himself awake. The clown inside him began to stir again.
0:46:46|0:46:56|When he opened his eyes again, the scene in front of him became eerie, with people around him casting hungry wolf-like glances at him, their faces becoming terrifying and distorted.
0:46:56|0:47:7|Like a beast. [Zheng Kaisi] moved forward uncontrollably, his face pale with fear. He pushed open a door and rushed in. In the dim and damp room, a group of people...
0:47:7|0:47:18|Sitting on the ground, a man glares menacingly at [Zheng Kaisi], his facial muscles twitching as if he's about to pounce. A drop of water slides down from a nearby pipe.
0:47:18|0:47:25|Water droplets fell on the floor, splashing a small patch of water. [Zheng Kaisi] looked around and let out a long sigh.
0:47:25|0:47:32|Turning around and leaving. He pushed open the door, a strong cold wind rushing in, engulfing the entire room in ice in an instant.
0:47:32|0:47:37|[Zheng Kaisi] was lifted off the ground by the wind and lost gravity the next second, flying out of the door.
0:47:37|0:47:47|In a moment of danger, he clung to the door frame with one hand, but soon his strength gave out. By then, the gambling hall outside the door was no longer there.
0:47:47|0:48:5|The boundless black night enveloped [Zheng Kaisi], floating in the sky. The bright moon behind him made [Zheng Kaisi] appear incredibly small in comparison. The nearby rooftop transformed into a giant claw, grabbing the ant-like [Zheng Kaisi] into its palm. Suddenly, he began to descend, passing through layers of clouds.
0:48:33|0:48:39|Zheng Kaisi, lying on the floor, gradually regained consciousness and slowly got up to ask.
0:48:50|0:48:59|[Zheng Kaisi] was furious, swinging his fists and getting into a fight. The man in black once again pushed [Zheng Kaisi] down onto the gambling table, prompting [Li Jun] to quickly step forward to explain.
0:48:59|0:49:7|The man in black released [Zheng Kaisi], [Li Jun] tried to help him up, but [Zheng Kaisi] pushed away [Li Jun] with a look of disgust on his face.
0:50:9|0:50:14|Li Jun lowered his head in shame.
0:50:54|0:51:1|Li Jun's expression turned bitter, he lowered his head helplessly and said. Zheng Kaisi looked at the fallen Li Jun.
0:51:1|0:51:7|The raging anger inside him had nowhere to vent. At this moment, another person was eliminated from the gambling table not far away.
0:51:7|0:51:13|The man in Arab clothing kept shouting and was then taken away by men in black.
0:51:13|0:51:19|At the same time, the broadcast announced the elimination of this person. [Zheng Kaisi] glanced at the scoreboard above.
0:51:19|0:51:37|He had 323 stones, 322 scissors, and 321 papers. He looked at the timer on the other side, with 1 hour 58 minutes and 28 seconds left. He opened the candy box he carried with him, eating candy while looking at the photo of [Li Jun] inside.
0:52:5|0:52:14|In the rest area, Meng Xiaopang, wearing broken glasses and sportswear, looked at Zheng Kaisi and Li Jun with a cold expression.
0:52:39|0:52:41|[Li Jun] looked at [Zheng Kaisi], hoping he would make a decision.
0:52:41|0:52:56|[Zheng Kaisi] took out all the remaining cards, and [Meng Xiaopang] took them and looked through them one by one, only to find four scissors and one cloth left. [Zheng Kaisi] took the cards back, but did not notice [Meng Xiaopang]'s slight movement.
0:53:29|0:53:38|Zheng Kaisi and Li Jun, who realized a card was missing, hurriedly chased after it. Meng Xiaopang, in a panic, bumped into many people along the way, causing a stream of curses.
0:53:38|0:53:47|He pushed away a man in front of the gambling table and threw his cards out, [Zheng Kaisi] and [Li Jun] saw this and had to stop in their tracks.
0:53:47|0:53:52|Meng Xiaopang faced the old man without changing his expression, the old man's eyes revealing cunning.
0:53:52|0:54:0|Calmly responding to the challenge. Several people stared at the cards on the table, holding their breath, waiting for the outcome. [Meng Xiaopang] played paper.
0:54:4|0:54:8|The old man took out the scissors, revealing a smug smile, and taunted.
0:54:8|0:54:14|Meng Xiaopang, with a face ashen, trembling lips, turned to look at Zheng Kaisi and Li Jun.
0:54:14|0:54:28|In the bathroom, Li Jun pins Meng Xiaopang against the toilet and starts beating him up. Zheng Kaisi stands outside, leaning against the sink and smoking.
0:54:28|0:54:37|Li Jun, who had vented his anger, walked out panting. Meng Xiaopang trembled and crawled to Zheng Kaisi's feet, kneeling on the ground and pleading.
0:56:8|0:56:18|[Zheng Kaisi] interrupted [Li Jun] and [Meng Xiaopang]'s words made him suddenly realize something. He stood up and walked to the side, arms crossed in front of him, seriously calculating.
0:57:12|0:57:20|[Zheng Kaisi] closed his eyes, while [Li Jun] and [Meng Xiaopang] eagerly waited beside him. Suddenly, he opened his eyes and a plan formed in his mind.
0:57:41|0:57:43|Confirming with him. After getting the money, [Zheng Kaisi]
0:57:43|0:57:50|[Zheng Kaisi] walked out of the loan office. He bumped into [Li Jun] head-on, completely unaware that he was already being targeted by someone.
0:58:3|0:58:18|The card counter shows that there are 136 stones, 135 scissors, and 137 cloths. [Zheng Kaisi] hands a bag filled with US dollars to [Li Jun].
0:58:22|0:58:27|The three approached the Scarred Man, and [Zheng Kaisi] spoke up.
0:58:27|0:58:41|The bearded man with slanted eyes looked at the three approaching men, entered Zheng Kaisi's number into the translator, and said. Relying on his five stars, the bearded man didn't take Zheng Kaisi and his two companions seriously at all.
0:58:41|0:58:48|Approaching the gambling table, [Zheng Kaisi] looked at the four cards, pretending to be hesitant. He placed the selected card face down on the table.
0:58:48|0:58:57|The bearded man across the table, expressionless, threw the cards onto the table and stared at [Zheng Kaisi] with a fierce and ruthless gaze.
0:58:57|0:59:5|Victory is within reach. But [Zheng Kaisi] has long seen through his intentions, exploiting the big beard's overconfident mindset.
0:59:5|0:59:8|Just to win a glimmer of hope.
0:59:8|0:59:15|The man in black flipped over the two cards, as expected, the bearded man's card was cloth. The three of them were overjoyed.
0:59:36|0:59:40|[Li Jun] and [Meng Xiaopang] looked at [Zheng Kaisi] in confusion and panic.
0:59:40|0:59:45|The bearded man looked up at the card counter, pondered for a moment, and then returned to the gambling table.
1:0:4|1:0:15|[Zheng Kaisi] lowered his head, flipping through the cards in his hand. Upon hearing these words, [Li Jun] and [Meng Xiaopang] looked despairing, while [Zheng Kaisi] methodically arranged the three cards in order.
1:0:16|1:0:24|The bearded man took out a card, placed it on the table, and [Zheng Kaisi] picked up the first card with a serious look, then played it.
1:0:24|1:0:27|He stared at [Scarred Man] with determination.
1:0:27|1:0:35|The man in black reveals Meng Xiaopang's card, which is a stone, causing regret among the three. The referee then reveals Zheng Kaisi's card and sees the pattern on it.
1:0:36|1:0:42|[Scarred Man] clenched his fist excitedly. [Li Jun] pulled [Zheng Kaisi] and [Meng Xiaopang] aside, saying.
1:0:50|1:0:58|Li Jun was stunned, not understanding what he was saying. Zheng Kaisi explained helplessly.
1:2:0|1:2:6|The three returned to the gambling table, and Scarred Man asked.
1:2:8|1:2:14|[Zheng Kaisi] shook his head and played the second card, with [Scarred Man] following closely behind, placing the card on the table.
1:2:14|1:2:22|The referee turned over the cards, as expected by [Zheng Kaisi], the card of [Scarred Man] was a cloth. [Zheng Kaisi] and the other two breathed a sigh of relief.
1:2:23|1:2:27|[Li Jun] excitedly collects the stars.
1:2:27|1:2:34|[Zheng Kaisi] plays the final card, and [Scarred Man] is no longer calm, his expression gradually turning angry.
1:2:34|1:2:40|The man in black turned over Scarred Man's card, revealing another cloth. Zheng Kaisi smirked and said.
1:2:40|1:2:48|He flipped the cards and threw them on the table, with [Li Jun] excitedly shouting beside him, [Meng Xiaopang] also dancing with excitement, the bearded man trembling with anger.
1:3:16|1:3:35|Although he still had three stars, unfortunately, he was eliminated early. [Anderson] grabbed the three stars from the cheater's arm, threw them to his subordinate, pulled out a gun, and shot the cheater in the forehead. His subordinate quickly carried the body away. As he wiped his hands, [Anderson] said.
1:4:3|1:4:14|Anderson looked at the documents in his hand, his emotions becoming more and more agitated, and angrily cursed. Anderson ruthlessly humiliated the players present.
1:4:27|1:4:32|With that, [Anderson] turned and left, the broadcast sounded again, and the game continued.
1:4:32|1:4:39|Before everyone could come to their senses, they were all sweating profusely. [Zheng Kaisi] realized the seriousness of the situation.
1:4:39|1:4:44|In the midst of panic, he kept pondering the next course of action.
1:5:18|1:5:24|On the side, [Zheng Kaisi] suddenly spoke up, staring intently at the card counter above, analyzing.
1:5:48|1:5:54|With Zheng Kaisi's explanation, the plan gradually became clear.
1:6:7|1:6:12|[Zheng Kaisi] interrupted [Li Jun], suddenly realizing something, and turned around to speak.
1:7:0|1:7:4|[Zheng Kaisi] finished explaining his plan and took the paper bag from [Li Jun]'s hand.
1:7:4|1:7:16|[Zheng Kaisi] took out some US dollars and handed them to [Meng Xiaopang], then put some in his pocket and returned the rest to [Li Jun]. The three of them started to move separately, and at this moment, the card counter displayed
1:7:16|1:7:27|117 stones, 121 scissors, 96 papers. Before long, each of the three found a player with three stars.
1:7:27|1:7:37|Facing these impeccable conditions, they all nodded in agreement and the plan proceeded smoothly. The three of them met up in the restroom.
1:7:50|1:7:57|[Zheng Kaisi] furrowed his brow, as [Li Jun] asked. [Zheng Kaisi] looked up and replied.
1:9:0|1:9:10|[Zheng Kaisi] felt that something was off, he lowered his head and divided the playing cards into three piles, handing one pile to [Meng Xiaopang], while [Li Jun] pressed down on his hand.
1:9:17|1:9:23|[Zheng Kaisi] stood up. He grabbed [Meng Xiaopang]'s hand and placed a stack of cards on it, saying.
1:9:47|1:9:52|After setting up, [Meng Xiaopang] walked out of the compartment, cautiously looked around, and quickly left.
1:9:52|1:10:1|He found an excellent vantage point, leaning against the wall, staring at the card counter. At this moment, there were only 59 minutes left. Inside the observation room on the second floor,
1:10:42|1:10:51|Li Jun looked up in confusion. Zheng Kaisi recalled,
1:10:51|1:11:1|On the night of his eighth birthday, he sat at the dining table with his parents, and suddenly a whistle outside the door gradually approached. His father turned to look at the door.
1:11:1|1:11:12|Suddenly, several black-clad men wearing sunglasses burst in. [Zheng Kaisi's Mother] reacted quickly, immediately stepping forward to shield [Zheng Kaisi] in her arms. Before the father could get up, he was pinned down in front of the table and couldn't move.
1:11:12|1:11:18|[Zheng Kaisi's Mother] led [Zheng Kaisi] to retreat, and in the blink of an eye, they were surrounded by several men in black.
1:11:18|1:11:27|One person picked up [Zheng Kaisi], threw him onto the sofa in the living room, covered his head with a cloth, and the TV was playing Invincible Clown.
1:11:48|1:11:53|There was a sudden noise outside the door, [Zheng Kaisi] signaled [Li Jun] to be quiet, and the two of them pushed the door of the compartment open a crack.
1:12:7|1:12:14|Ando heard the noise coming from the compartment.
1:12:14|1:12:22|Alert. At this moment, [Meng Xiaopang] pushes the door open.
1:12:50|1:13:2|[Zheng Kaisi] turned around and looked at [Li Jun] and [Meng Xiaopang], as if asking them, but also asking himself. [Li Jun] and [Meng Xiaopang] looked at each other in confusion.
1:13:27|1:13:33|[Zheng Kaisi] was also in a panic, realizing that things had completely spiraled out of control.
1:13:41|1:13:52|At this moment, there are 41 minutes left, with 80 rocks and 82 papers remaining on the field, while only 56 scissors are left, rapidly disappearing.
1:13:52|1:13:59|The three of them seemed to be trapped in a quagmire.
1:14:3|1:14:8|Seeing [Zheng Kaisi] remain silent, [Li Jun] became anxious and said.
1:14:8|1:14:11|He made up his mind and walked away, [Meng Xiaopang] noticed and spoke.
1:14:23|1:14:34|In this way, [Li Jun] and [Meng Xiaopang] both started a competition with others, trying to throw out the stones they had accumulated before running out of scissors.
1:14:36|1:14:41|Both of them unexpectedly revealed their cards at the same time, causing them to lose all the two backup stars they had.
1:14:41|1:14:56|Standing not far away, [Zheng Kaisi] saw the outcome and closed his eyes in despair, feeling as if all hope was lost. Everything the three of them had planned so meticulously was now in vain, all their efforts gone to waste, and they were left with nothing but losses.
1:14:56|1:15:15|Time is passing by minute by minute, and in the blink of an eye, there are only 29 minutes left. [Zheng Kaisi], [Li Jun], and [Meng Xiaopang] are sitting on chairs on the sidelines, with only three stars left, they dare not challenge anyone again. The three of them sit there listlessly, having already given up the struggle.
1:15:15|1:15:23|At this moment, a man with two henchmen walked over, looking very confident, and said.
1:15:35|1:15:40|Recalling what just happened, the three of them suddenly realized and immediately stood up alertly. [Zheng Kaisi] said.
1:16:7|1:16:15|He placed his left hand on [Zheng Kaisi]'s shoulder and continued speaking. [Anderson] opened his mouth wide.
1:16:54|1:17:1|After speaking, Anderson waited for Zheng Kaisi's decision. Zheng Kaisi lowered his head, his brain working rapidly. At this moment,
1:17:1|1:17:9|With only 28 minutes left, [Luca] started to become irritable.
1:17:44|1:17:51|[Meng Xiaopang] looked at [Zheng Kaisi] with a look of resignation on his face.
1:18:2|1:18:8|[Li Jun] gritted his teeth and said.
1:18:15|1:18:19|[Luka] looked helplessly at the three people in front of him who quickly reached an agreement.
1:18:19|1:18:30|Having to take off the translator, [Zheng Kaisi] turned around and discussed with his little brother. During the wait, he closely watched [Luca] and carefully pondered his thoughts. As for [Li Jun],
1:18:30|1:18:39|With a furrowed brow and a look of worry on his face, [Zheng Kaisi] finally convinced his little brother. Turning around, he said.
1:18:39|1:18:45|Seeing Zheng Kaisi's hesitation, Luca patted his shoulder.
1:18:49|1:18:53|Smugly said.
1:18:53|1:18:55|After some contemplation, [Zheng Kaisi] lowered his head.
1:18:55|1:18:56|Agreed quickly. After reaching a consensus,
1:18:58|1:19:6|Six people came to an empty gambling table with great momentum. Two groups, led by Zheng Kaisi and Luca respectively, were facing each other.
1:19:6|1:19:13|The situation is about to escalate. Luca wears all three stars that are used as bets on his arm, with both hands on the table.
1:19:13|1:19:27|[Zheng Kaisi] looked fearless and determined as he met Luca's arrogant gaze, without any hesitation, he played his cards first. Luca tilted his head and raised a card with his right hand, a hint of contempt in his eyes.
1:19:27|1:19:38|At that moment, his two eyeballs suddenly burst out, his neck stretched several times, instantly turning into a monster over two meters tall. He snarled at [Zheng Kaisi], as if the next second,
1:19:38|1:19:46|Zheng Kaisi quickly reached out to block the saliva and demonic wind splashing towards him from the person opposite, about to tear him apart. After calming down,
1:19:46|1:19:52|Luca's face changed suddenly, wanting to destroy the cards.
1:19:57|1:20:4|Luca tried to explain, but was sternly stopped by the referee. His henchman approached and asked, and Luca said.
1:21:55|1:21:59|[Zheng Kaisi] held the scissors in his hand and threw it towards the three people opposite.
1:21:59|1:22:26|And Luca's face had already turned ashen, the fierce energy from before completely gone. He glared at [Zheng Kaisi] with a vicious look, as if [Zheng Kaisi] had once again transformed into an invincible clown monster, returning to the subway car full of monsters, back to that seemingly endless, brutal game of combat with the endless monsters in the car. And at this moment, Luca also transformed back into a monster in the game.
1:22:26|1:22:30|Until the referee turned over his cards, sure enough, it was a cloth.
1:22:46|1:22:51|[Zheng Kaisi] looked at him pitifully and didn't refuse. Luca lost.
1:22:51|1:22:54|In the match, [Zheng Kaisi] stepped forward and whispered.
1:23:21|1:23:30|Luca saw the two accomplices going upstairs and became furious.
1:23:30|1:23:36|Luca calmed down and nodded, saying.
1:24:20|1:24:23|[Zheng Kaisi] flashed an innocent smile.
1:24:23|1:24:29|Luca had no choice but to go for a loan. Luca slammed the paper bag filled with US dollars onto [Zheng Kaisi]'s body.
1:24:30|1:24:37|Zheng Kaisi leaned against the wall, feeling angry. He didn't even bother to lift his head when he heard those words.
1:24:37|1:24:44|He counted the money in the bag, turned to look at Luca's angry back, and couldn't help but roll his eyes.
1:25:9|1:25:14|Upon hearing Zhang Jingkun's voice again, [Zheng Kaisi] suppressed his anger and turned around to speak.
1:25:15|1:25:25|Zheng Kaisi withdrew his hand again. [Zheng Kaisi] sneered sarcastically.
1:25:42|1:25:49|[Zheng Kaisi] was about to turn around, but was grabbed by Zhang Jingkun.
1:26:18|1:26:26|[Zheng Kaisi] violently chopped off Zhang Jingkun's hand and then walked away.
1:26:37|1:26:48|[Zheng Kaisi] turned around to see Zhang Jingkun reaching out his hand tremblingly, with a hint of pleading in his stubborn eyes. [Zheng Kaisi] walked up and lifted his hand.
1:26:48|1:26:54|He simply clasped his hands together, took big strides away, completely extinguishing his hope.
1:26:56|1:27:5|[Zheng Kaisi] turned a deaf ear and went to meet up with [Li Jun] and [Meng Xiaopang].
1:27:7|1:27:15|Li Jun leaned down and whispered in Zheng Kaisi's ear.
1:27:37|1:27:44|Time passed by minute by minute, and the remaining players in the hall became more and more cautious.
1:27:44|1:27:50|The game proceeded at a leisurely pace, with [Zheng Kaisi], [Li Jun], and [Meng Xiaopang] closely watching the card counter. Everything was ready,
1:27:52|1:28:1|The wind is missing. In no time, the number of cloths has changed from 39 to 37. The three of them walked towards the center of the hall, with [Zheng Kaisi] glancing back at [Li Jun].
1:28:1|1:28:10|Li Jun quickly handed over the clothes in his hand, concealing the playing cards in Zheng Kaisi's hand. Unexpectedly, Zhang Jingkun intercepted halfway, pointing to the number on his own neck.
1:28:37|1:28:44|Li Jun was frightened, but [Zheng Kaisi] faced Zhang Jingkun's provocation without fear.
1:29:22|1:29:30|The scene suddenly quieted down, Zhang Jingkun breathed a sigh of relief. The crowd fell into panic.
1:29:39|1:29:46|Li Jun looked panic-stricken at [Zheng Kaisi] and [Meng Xiaopang], seeing that neither of them was taking action, he could only stand by anxiously.
1:29:46|1:29:57|Zhang Jingkun looked at [Zheng Kaisi] with a sly smile. Above the Destiny, the night sky was still endless, but danger was gradually enveloping the entire ship.
1:29:57|1:30:5|In the hall, 15 players are sitting in a circle, with Zheng Kaisi sorting the collected playing cards.
1:30:24|1:30:40|As soon as the words fell, the players around nodded in agreement. [Zheng Kaisi] on the sofa beside angrily raised his head, closed the candy box in his hand, and stood up to walk into the crowd.
1:30:44|1:30:51|Zhang Jingkun asked knowingly. He snorted when he saw the large stack of cards that [Zheng Kaisi] took out.
1:31:8|1:31:17|Zhang Jingkun spread out the neatly arranged cards on the ground, as the anxious eyes of the surrounding players watched on, he repeatedly shuffled and stacked the cards.
1:31:17|1:31:26|The shuffling technique is extremely skillful, with no apparent flaws. Everyone secretly prays to get good cards. After shuffling the cards,
1:31:26|1:31:33|Zhang Jingkun distributed the original number to everyone, then stood up and walked towards [Zheng Kaisi] with the remaining cards in hand.
1:31:33|1:31:49|Just as [Zheng Kaisi] reached out to catch it, Zhang Jingkun threw the playing cards into the air, flashing a sinister smile at [Zheng Kaisi]. Dozens of cards scattered from the air, as Zhang Jingkun provocatively spread his arms and shouted.
1:31:51|1:31:57|Li Jun and Meng Xiaopang hurriedly picked up the playing cards on the ground, while Zheng Kaisi stared at Zhang Jingkun and slowly stood up.
1:31:57|1:32:3|Zhang Jingkun sneered.
1:32:3|1:32:16|He walked past [Zheng Kaisi], his eyes sending shivers down one's spine. At this moment, [Zheng Kaisi] was already furious, his fierce gaze as if wanting to torture Zhang Jingkun inch by inch. Other players.
1:32:16|1:32:24|The competition has already begun in a race against time, but [Zheng Kaisi] and the other two are still sorting out the scattered playing cards. [Zheng Kaisi] looks at the card counter.
1:32:24|1:32:34|The decreasing numbers made Zheng Kaisi extremely anxious. On the other side, Zhang Jingkun had already found a new target and won the stars from the man with long hair, turning to look behind him.
1:32:35|1:32:41|The three frantic and disorganized individuals, [Zheng Kaisi], sneered contemptuously, turned around and left.
1:33:4|1:33:9|As soon as the words fell, a player behind him was taken away by a black-clothed man for losing the game.
1:33:9|1:33:16|At this moment, Zhang Jingkun is trying to deceive a man in a duckbill cap.
1:33:27|1:33:32|Zhang Jingkun immediately rolled his eyes and remained silent. [Zheng Kaisi] then turned to the person wearing a duckbill cap next to him.
1:33:48|1:33:55|[Zheng Kaisi] looked coldly at Zhang Jingkun, but Zhang Jingkun spared no effort to pretend to be a good person, walking up to [Zheng Kaisi] and speaking.
1:35:1|1:35:11|Seeing that his conspiracy was about to be exposed, Zheng Kaisi's face turned ugly, but he forced a big smile to hide his anger.
1:35:27|1:35:37|With these words, Zheng Kaisi was dumbfounded, while the man in the duckbill cap quickly took out his last card, revealing a subtle crease in the lower left corner.
1:35:38|1:35:46|Before Zhang Jingkun shuffled the cards, he had already secretly made marks. [Zheng Kaisi] looked at the man in the duckbill cap and asked.
1:35:48|1:35:56|The man in the duckbill cap finally came to his senses, looking at Zheng Kaisi with lingering fear. Zheng Kaisi breathed a sigh of relief.
1:36:36|1:36:49|In front of [Zheng Kaisi], three cards were placed upside down on the table, surrounded by a group of players watching the game. The man in the duckbill cap pointed to one of them with a serious expression. The referee stepped forward and turned it over, revealing a card with a stone on it.
1:36:52|1:36:59|In the desperate sigh of the man in the duckbill cap, the referee announced the result of the game and turned over the remaining two cards.
1:36:59|1:37:6|The man in the duckbill cap had no choice but to admit defeat and hand over the stars. [Zheng Kaisi] rearranged the three cards.
1:37:6|1:37:18|Another player joined the game of [Zheng Kaisi], he decisively chose the card in the middle, and when he saw the scissors on it, he excitedly clenched his fist and embraced his companion next to him in celebration.
1:37:24|1:37:31|The blond across from him trembled as he raised his arm and pointed to the card on the far right, then excitedly shouted.
1:38:2|1:38:9|Zhang Jingkun ignored [Zheng Kaisi] and continued on his determined path.
1:39:5|1:39:14|With that, [Zheng Kaisi] looked at Zhang Jingkun with a smile in his eyes, then patted his shoulder and left.
1:39:14|1:39:20|The gaze turned icy in the moment of turning around, intelligence was cleverly misled.
1:39:20|1:39:44|At this moment, Zhang Jingkun was like a clown, being toyed with by [Zheng Kaisi], the sound of the timer exerting invisible pressure on him. Helpless, he had to endure the humiliation and make his way to table 6. Currently, he had 8 stars left on him, along with one card.
1:40:0|1:40:5|With only two minutes left before the end of the game, [Zheng Kaisi] calmly analyzed the situation.
1:41:11|1:41:30|[Zheng Kaisi] comforts the worried [Li Jun] beside him, randomly picks a card from a stack of cards and holds it in his hand. Then he turns his head and looks coldly at Zhang Jingkun. With no other choice, Zhang Jingkun reaches out and takes five stars from his arm, angrily throws them on the table, and plays the last card.
1:41:30|1:41:40|[Zheng Kaisi] snorted coldly, looked mockingly at Zhang Jingkun, hatred suddenly surged in his mind. He deliberately delayed time and spoke coldly.
1:41:40|1:41:53|As soon as these words were spoken, everyone turned to look at Zheng Kaisi. Zheng Kaisi maintained his arrogant attitude, glanced around reluctantly, and said.
1:42:0|1:42:7|Hearing [Zheng Kaisi]'s tough tone, Zhang Jingkun felt helpless, but his actions were neither painful nor itchy.
1:42:17|1:42:28|Zhang Jingkun gritted his teeth, glanced up at the timer again, with only 15 seconds left until the end of the match. He took off the translator by his ear and struck his own face hard.
1:42:30|1:42:41|Zhang Jingkun dared to be angry but dared not speak, and soon blood oozed from the corner of his mouth. Nevertheless, he still held his head high, staring intently into [Zheng Kaisi]'s eyes, refusing to show any weakness.
1:42:41|1:42:46|The harder the slaps, the wider the smile on [Zheng Kaisi]'s face, savoring the pleasure of revenge.
1:42:48|1:42:52|And there were only three seconds left.
1:42:52|1:42:57|Seeing [Zheng Kaisi] play his cards, Zhang Jingkun finally stopped and trembled as he exhaled a breath.
1:42:57|1:43:4|[Zheng Kaisi] showed the cloth in his hand to Zhang Jingkun, then threw it on the table to mock his previous shameless behavior.
1:43:4|1:43:15|At the same time, the timer stopped at zero hours, zero minutes, and zero seconds, [Zheng Kaisi's Mother] won without any suspense. Zhang Jingkun looked at [Zheng Kaisi] with resentment and turned away.
1:43:15|1:43:25|Upon reaching the safe zone on the second floor, [Zheng Kaisi] handed over all five stars he had won to [Li Jun] and [Meng Xiaopang]. He then took on the remaining playing cards himself.
1:43:25|1:43:36|[Zheng Kaisi] is pushed forward by the men in black in front of everyone's eyes. He looks back at [Li Jun], placing all his hopes on him, confidently believing that he
1:43:36|1:43:46|He will definitely be redeemed. At this moment, the radio started playing. The broadcast was on a loop. The numbers on the card counter,
1:43:53|1:44:1|The first light of dawn shines on the sea, [Zheng Kaisi] is brought into a dimly lit room filled with discarded clothes.
1:44:1|1:44:12|The man in black ordered him to take off his clothes, only giving him a towel to cover himself. Inside the room were the previously eliminated players, all of them bare-chested like [Zheng Kaisi].
1:44:12|1:44:18|A Scarred Man sat cross-legged in front of the French window, leisurely speaking.
1:44:25|1:44:34|The people in the room were like zombies, with empty eyes and a sense of despair, waiting for death.
1:44:34|1:44:44|The Scarred Man continued. Zheng Kaisi adjusted the towel around his waist and sat down on the floor.
1:44:44|1:44:53|The shoulder blade of [Scarred Man] seems to be injured. An old man dragged his weak body over, panting heavily and said.
1:44:58|1:45:5|Zheng Kaisi recalls the scene he saw in the restroom.
1:46:6|1:46:15|The Scarred Man glanced at Zheng Kaisi's hand, then at his puzzled expression, and continued.
1:46:27|1:46:32|The broadcast sounded again, and everyone's eyes gathered on the high platform on the second floor.
1:46:32|1:46:43|[Anderson] leaned on his cane, picked up a remote control, and pressed a button. The glass on the window in the corner of the hall, which was originally opaque, instantly became transparent, revealing the scene inside the dark room.
1:47:18|1:47:32|[Zheng Kaisi] was showing off to the Scarred Man next to him, but the Scarred Man was unimpressed and gave a disdainful smile. Anderson announced that Li Jun and Meng Xiaopang, who had ten stars, instantly became the targets of everyone and were surrounded by the crowd.
1:47:42|1:47:49|Li Jun turned his head and met Zheng Kaisi's gaze, and could only compromise.
1:47:52|1:47:57|Li Jun didn't expect that his bid, even at such a high price, would be snatched away.
1:48:4|1:48:15|[Li Jun] pointed at [Zheng Kaisi] behind the glass window, removed the extra three stars, and handed them to the man in black. Suddenly, [Meng Xiaopang] reached out and snatched the stars, saying gloomily.
1:50:4|1:50:11|The cries for [Zheng Kaisi] fell on deaf ears. When he opened his eyes again, he was already wearing a different face, saying.
1:50:15|1:50:22|[Zheng Kaisi] was dumbfounded, looking at [Li Jun] in disbelief. At this moment, [Li Jun] had already been blinded by desire.
1:50:22|1:50:24|Kneeling on the ground with red eyes.
1:50:36|1:50:42|With that, [Li Jun] stood up and left without looking back.
1:50:44|1:50:51|[Zheng Kaisi] pounded the glass in despair and anger, while [Scarred Man] sneered beside him.
1:51:33|1:51:40|The Scarred Man sneered at Zheng Kaisi as he walked towards the door.
1:51:40|1:51:47|Who knew, [Zheng Kaisi] lost his mind and charged towards [Scarred Man] like a madman, knocking him down with a punch.
1:51:47|1:51:56|Straddling him, she kept punching his face with her fists. Before long, the man in black rushed in and pinned [Zheng Kaisi] to the ground.
1:51:56|1:52:3|The Scarred Man, covered in blood, gets up and spits at Zheng Kaisi, then picks up the money bag and hurriedly leaves.
1:52:5|1:52:11|The old man expressed concern on the side. [Zheng Kaisi] remained silent, gritting his teeth and sitting up straight.
1:52:11|1:52:18|His eyes were filled with boiling blood, panting heavily as he spoke.
1:53:30|1:53:37|Scarred Man was stunned, turned his head and found that the bandage on his shoulder had disappeared. The three of them were dumbfounded and looked at each other in disbelief.
1:53:37|1:53:46|The Scarred Man's pupils dilated, he suddenly turned around and saw Zheng Kaisi standing by the window, unfolding the tightly clenched piece of gauze, inside
1:53:49|1:53:57|The companions didn't bother to find trouble with the [Scarred Man], quickly took out three stars and handed them to the man in black, requesting to ransom [Zheng Kaisi].
1:54:20|1:54:28|The old man wept bitterly, but [Zheng Kaisi] ignored him and walked away indifferently. Seeing this, the old man pleaded.
1:55:25|1:55:31|He rushed into the hall and punched [Meng Xiaopang] in the face, roaring and venting his anger wildly.
1:55:37|1:55:46|Companion, at this moment, [Meng Xiaopang] in his eyes is no different from those monsters on the subway. He once again becomes a clown, returning to the original subway car, leveling up and fighting monsters all the way.
1:55:53|1:56:12|Another heavy blow landed, causing Meng Xiaopang's glasses to fall to the ground. He was beaten up, his face bruised and swollen. Zheng Kaisi, having vented his emotions, was like a clown who had just passed through the subway gate, manic yet incredibly clear-headed. He took the money bag from Meng Xiaopang's hand, stood up, and looked down at him threateningly.
1:56:14|1:56:30|Meng Xiaopang was unable to speak, tremblingly reached out his hand to hand three stars to Zheng Kaisi. Li Jun felt ashamed to face Zheng Kaisi.
1:56:34|1:56:41|Faced with the questioning from [Zheng Kaisi], [Li Jun] couldn't say a word for a long time, just feeling ashamed.
1:56:41|1:56:52|With his head held high, [Zheng Kaisi] wasted no time in snatching the money bag from [Li Jun]'s hand. Under the gaze of the onlookers, he slowly walked to the window of the dark room and pointed inside.
1:56:52|1:57:1|The lonely old man. [Zheng Kaisi] handed three stars to the man in black, and the old man limped to the window.
1:57:20|1:57:25|The old man wept uncontrollably, his frail body trembling uncontrollably.
1:57:28|1:57:38|[Zheng Kaisi] did not respond, showing no emotion, and turned to leave. His face was covered in bloodstains, his eyes sharp, as he walked towards the center of the hall.
1:57:39|1:57:46|He suddenly looked up and glanced at Anderson in the observation room. Anderson stood by the window, met Zheng Kaisi's gaze, and said, "Interesting."
1:57:47|1:57:54|At this moment, the sun rises in the east, but the sky seems to be shrouded in a hazy veil.
1:57:54|1:58:5|The massive Destiny ship is docked at the pier, with a row of cars parked next to it, waiting for people to disembark. [Scarred Man]'s two companions and the man in the white suit are all in the queue.
1:58:5|1:58:30|[Zheng Kaisi] carrying a backpack, his face filled with exhaustion, turned his head to look at the Destiny, showing no emotion on his face, but feeling lost inside. In just one night, he was reborn in this hellish game, he won, but stepped on the blood of countless people. He deluded himself into changing the rules of the animal world, but could not change the human nature of survival of the fittest.
1:58:30|1:58:38|In the hospital, Li Jun is by the sink, bending over to wash her hair. She closes her eyes skillfully as she reaches for the shampoo.
1:58:38|1:58:42|The busy work made her have to speed up her actions.
1:58:42|1:58:50|At this moment, someone sneaked up from behind and reached into the sink, dripping some fake blood into the water.
1:58:50|1:58:58|Li Jun, however, was completely unaware and continued to wash her hair. When she opened her eyes, the bloody scene in front of her terrified her.
1:58:58|1:59:5|The sound of screams echoed in the hospital corridor. Li Jun stood up and quickly wiped the water off his face.
1:59:25|1:59:33|The two of them looked at each other in silence, [Zheng Kaisi] lowered his head to suppress his emotions, then rushed forward and embraced Li Jun.
1:59:33|1:59:42|He could no longer control his emotions, his arms involuntarily tightening as Li Jun leaned against [Zheng Kaisi]'s chest, trembling slightly.
1:59:55|2:0:8|The two embraced tightly, feeling the hard-won reunion. He looked out the window, the sunlight unusually gentle. He couldn't help but hold the person in his arms even tighter.
2:0:32|2:0:36|The film is about to say goodbye to you here.
2:0:36|2:0:40|Thank you for listening. The movie will end with a post-credits scene.
2:0:40|2:0:54|Now let's talk about the post-credits scene. In the early morning,
2:0:54|2:1:6|The entire ward was very quiet, and [Zheng Kaisi's Mother]'s bed had been moved back to the ward. [Zheng Kaisi] sat on a chair next to the hospital bed, sound asleep after a night of vigilance, exhausted.
