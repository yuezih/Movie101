0:3:38|0:3:47|Fireworks and cannons were booming on the bustling street, while inside this hotel,
0:4:34|0:4:46|The spy approached to inspect the food. When the window glass was smashed, the spies immediately aimed their guns. They approached to investigate and relaxed their guard only after confirming that there was nothing unusual.
0:4:48|0:4:52|He didn't check the food and approved it to be served, the stewardess took it away and walked forward.
0:4:57|0:5:3|Mr. Fan glanced at the steamed chicken.
0:5:4|0:5:22|As soon as the words fell, the stewardess opened the steamer and pulled out a gun, shooting Ye Jianbo dead with two shots. The secret agents immediately fired at him as he fled in panic towards the door, and he was shot in the leg just as he was about to reach the door.
0:5:22|0:5:29|The agents took the opportunity to chase after them, while Mr. Fan sat at the dining table, looking in horror at the body of Ye Jianbo.
0:5:29|0:5:36|More and more news about assassinations and attacks are appearing in the newspapers. The headline reads "Ye Jianbo Assassinated".
0:5:36|0:5:52|The Tenth Army of the Central China Front, Lieutenant Colonel Yanagimura, was poisoned, the 34th Division's General Nobuchika Miyamoto was ambushed, and even the Kwantung Army's Epidemic Prevention Water Supply Research Base was attacked. The Central China Front dispatched military transport vehicles were bombed, and Lieutenant Colonel Tanaka Shigemitsu of the 15th Division was ambushed.
0:5:52|0:6:8|A series of reports, newspapers after newspapers, have exposed all the negative news about the puppet government and the Japanese army, creating an atmosphere of terror. Even within their ranks, more and more high-ranking military and political officials are filled with fear and anxiety, unable to find peace.
0:6:10|0:6:17|In the interrogation room of the Japanese East China Military Police Branch that day, the female assassin sat on the ground, the blood on her legs had just dried up.
0:6:17|0:6:25|The director of the secret service department [Wang Tianxiang] sniffed a brush on the side. The female assassin looked at him in great fear.
0:6:37|0:6:57|Wang Tianxiang brushed the spices on the chest of the female assassin. The female assassin looked at him in horror, but had no intention of betraying the organization. The chief of the secret service didn't want to waste time, so he picked up the spices and sprinkled them on the chest of the female spy.
0:6:57|0:7:3|He then got up and walked to the pool to wash his hands. His subordinate turned on the faucet for him.
0:7:8|0:7:12|The hounds are barking wildly. The female spy is extremely nervous.
0:7:21|0:7:24|The hound gnawed on the part smeared with spices.
0:7:24|0:7:29|Imperial Army special agent chief [Wu Tian] arrived at the dungeon. [Wu Tian] slowed down and turned around.
0:7:45|0:7:53|Uncle Liu bowed and took orders. Finally, he followed [Wang Tianxiang] to the interrogation room.
0:7:53|0:8:1|Here, [Wu Tian] returning to the headquarters was questioned by the major general. The task of destroying the assassination organization has been handed over to the anti-bandit headquarters of the Wang government.
0:8:21|0:8:31|General ruthlessly mocked his unreliable intuition. [Wu Tian] could no longer argue at this point, as intuition without evidence is hard to convince others.
0:8:32|0:8:37|He stared at the general, took two steps back, and suddenly knelt down in front of the general.
0:8:38|0:8:48|The lieutenant general was slightly stunned. [Wu Tian] placed his hands on his thighs and made the final request.
0:8:48|0:8:55|After speaking, [Wu Tian] knocked his head, and the general still remained silent.
0:8:55|0:9:6|On the other side, the old man known as "Uncle Six" walked out of the military police department under the escort of a Japanese military officer. As they parted ways, they exchanged greetings. Inside the interrogation room,
0:9:6|0:9:11|The spy was cleaning the iron frame. The female assassin lay on the ground, with a horrifying look of death.
0:9:11|0:9:18|Her temples and eye corners are pierced with silver needles, and there are bloodstains on her face and chest. [Wu Tian] is standing in front of the office window.
0:9:18|0:9:26|[Wang Tianxiang] walked over and handed a tattered notebook. [Wu Tian] ignored it and turned back to his chair.
0:9:27|0:9:31|[Wang Tianxiang] was a little unhappy, holding a notebook and following along.
0:9:42|0:9:48|[Wu Tian] lowered his head and pondered for a while while leaning on the chair.
0:9:49|0:9:55|He lightly tapped the table with his fingers, [Wang Tianxiang] understood and put down the notebook.
0:9:55|0:10:4|[Wu Tian] put on white gloves and gently opened the cover of the old notebook.
0:10:8|0:10:14|In front of the City God Temple, there are people sharpening scissors and various small vendors, with people coming and going on the street.
0:10:15|0:10:23|At this moment, the Japanese soldiers were running in formation for training. Along the roadside, in the cars, [Kusunoki Colonel] was sitting.
0:10:23|0:10:31|[Wang Tianxiang] was smoking and staring at the tip. At this moment, an old man with a hat and a limp, carrying a bag and smoking, was walking among the crowd.
0:10:31|0:10:40|His limping figure quickly caught the attention of the disguised secret agent. At the corner, the secret agent disguised as a foreign cart driver also recognized this limping man.
0:10:40|0:10:47|The old man with a limp unknowingly walked towards the notice board. The foreign coachman quickly turned around and ran to the front of the carriage.
0:10:47|0:10:59|Director Gu Xiaomeng was stunned for a moment, then pondered for a while before taking a drag of his cigarette.
0:11:0|0:11:5|The foreign coachman turned and ran away. On the street, Grandpa Xue continued to stagger towards the bulletin board.
0:11:6|0:11:11|The spy behind was about to catch someone red-handed, but the foreign coachman rushed over to stop him.
0:11:13|0:11:22|Disguised spies pass messages to each other. Uncle Xue remains oblivious, still pasting glue on the bulletin board. His expression is dull, his actions natural.
0:11:22|0:11:31|No one could tell that he was on a mission. After finishing, he walked into the crowd carrying a bucket.
0:11:52|0:12:2|Wu Tian drew some circles on the map. After speaking, he stretched lazily. A confidential message came through the office telegraph.
0:12:2|0:12:8|The intelligence is transmitted through complex equipment in the form of radio electromagnetic waves, and is emitted at the terminal.
0:12:8|0:12:33|The recent terrorist activities have been rampant, and it seems that our intelligence channels have been infiltrated. Imperial Lieutenant General Hang Wei Liang has invited Commander Zhang and relevant personnel from the Anti-Bandit Command to discuss the intelligence operation process at Baicaotang in the western suburbs on the evening of October 31st at 9:00. The full content of the secret telegram has been sent to the Wang Wei East Anti-Bandit Command.
0:12:33|0:12:42|This secret telegram is a trap set by Colonel [Wu Tian]. Its purpose is to use the informant to lure out the lurking old ghosts and old guns.
0:12:42|0:12:51|That day, inside the Wang Puppet Government's East China Suppression Bandit Command. In the telegraph room, a group of code clerks worked in an orderly manner.
0:12:52|0:13:1|Some are tapping on the telegraph machine to send messages, some are consulting the codebook to translate telegrams, while at the front, [Gu Xiaomeng] is making a phone call and taking notes on the document content.
0:13:1|0:13:8|She then hung up the phone, put the written content into a folder, and quickly walked into the office further inside.
0:13:9|0:13:18|She handed the folder to the leader of the translation team [Li Ningyu]. [Li Ningyu] opened the folder and took out the manuscript to look through it.
0:13:18|0:13:23|Closing the folder again, she copied the manuscript onto another piece of paper.
0:13:24|0:13:32|Receiving and Dispatching Officer [Gu Xiaomeng] walked into the director's office holding a folder. Coincidentally, the captain of the Counter-Espionage Team [Wu Zhiguo] was also in the room.
0:13:32|0:13:40|Director Wu answered the phone with one hand and took the folder with the other. Lighting a cigarette with a lighter, he approached.
0:13:41|0:13:47|He took a deep drag on his cigarette and walked over to Director Wu's side. Director Wu impatiently hung up the phone.
0:13:47|0:13:56|Next, he closed the folder and walked out of the office. This person is the director of the Military Intelligence Department, [Jin Shenghuo]. He walked quickly towards the commander's office with the folder in hand.
0:14:0|0:14:8|Upon entering, he saw only the commander's aide [Bai Xiaonian] leaning on the sofa. When [Bai Xiaonian] saw the director, he stood up to take the documents.
0:14:10|0:14:16|[Bai Xiaonian] snorted, snatched the folder, flipped through it, and pushed open the door to walk into the commander's inner room.
0:14:19|0:14:29|Pushing open the door, [Bai Xiaonian] holding a file, quickly walked to the commander's desk and put it in the drawer. Two days later at the City God Temple, in the evening,
0:14:29|0:14:41|The pedestrian traffic was bustling, and Old Xue carried a bucket of paste to the bulletin board. He leisurely posted a lottery notice on the bulletin board. After finishing these tasks, he left with the bucket.
0:14:41|0:14:49|And the information conveyed by this lottery announcement is: On October 31st, gather at Baicaotang and launch a surprise attack.
0:14:54|0:14:59|At night, in the nightclub filled with revelry, handsome men and beautiful women sway and dance on the dance floor.
0:14:59|0:15:7|Among them, there are young elites from the military and business sectors who come to drink and have a good time. [Gu Xiaomeng] is dancing with a young white man.
0:15:7|0:15:13|While [Li Ningyu] was leaning on the bar smoking, there was still half a glass of liquor in front of her.
0:15:13|0:15:20|The beautiful [Li Ningyu] looks worried, as if she has something on her mind. She stares at the ashtray, smoking a cigarette meant for men.
0:15:20|0:15:28|In the dance floor, [Gu Xiaomeng] was having a great time, completing difficult dance moves with the help of her partner. The bartender answered the phone at the bar.
0:15:31|0:15:34|[Li Ningyu] stared at the bartender, as if expecting something.
0:15:34|0:15:41|[Gu Xiaomeng] made her way through the crowded room towards the bar. [Li Ningyu] noticed the return of [Gu Xiaomeng] and finished the glass of whiskey in her hand.
0:15:41|0:15:52|[Gu Xiaomeng] answers the phone. After hanging up, [Gu Xiaomeng] grabs a bottle of foreign liquor and leans in to greet [Li Ningyu].
0:15:55|0:16:1|[Li Ningyu] stood up and extinguished the cigarette in her hand. [Gu Xiaomeng] picked up the cup and downed the whiskey in one gulp.
0:16:1|0:16:7|Leave a tip. The two put on their coats and leave gracefully. In the late night,
0:16:7|0:16:16|A car is driving on a mountain road, with [Bai Xiaonian], [Gu Xiaomeng], [Li Ningyu], [Wu Zhiguo], and [Jin Shenghuo] inside.
0:16:16|0:16:25|After drinking, [Gu Xiaomeng] couldn't bear the bumps and leaned against the window, vomiting. The unpleasant smell spread throughout the car.
0:16:25|0:16:29|The crowd took out handkerchiefs, covering their noses or gently fanning.
0:16:31|0:16:36|A car arrived at a iron gate, and the soldiers stationed on both sides quickly moved the roadblocks aside.
0:16:37|0:16:46|After the car smoothly passed through, it stopped by the side of a small road not long after. The winding and narrow road was only wide enough for one person to pass through.
0:16:46|0:16:52|On both sides of the small road stood two bunkers, with huge searchlights shining brightly on top.
0:16:52|0:16:58|The guard opens the car door. [Wu Zhiguo] steps out first, followed by Director [Jin Shenghuo],
0:16:58|0:17:4|Translation team leader [Li Ningyu] and communications officer [Gu Xiaomeng]. The rugged mountain path at night,
0:17:5|0:17:13|[Gu Xiaomeng] and [Li Ningyu] supported each other as they moved forward. The group arrived at a steel bridge, surrounded by a sinister atmosphere.
0:17:13|0:17:22|[Gu Xiaomeng] couldn't help it and muttered under her breath.
0:17:24|0:17:32|As the aide-de-camp of the commander, [Bai Xiaonian] clarified things for everyone.
0:17:32|0:17:40|The group arrived at the bridge. [Wu Zhiguo] saw the Japanese warning sign on the side.
0:17:43|0:17:49|Everyone followed [Bai Xiaonian]'s gaze.
0:18:8|0:18:16|[Bai Xiaonian] seductively pushed aside [Gu Xiaomeng] and walked towards the room. With him leading the way, everyone followed suit. Until finally,
0:18:16|0:18:24|Li Ningyu was left, walking with her good friend Gu Xiaomeng. As they passed by the head of the secret service, Wang Tianxiang, Gu Xiaomeng took the opportunity to provocatively glance at him.
0:18:24|0:18:34|Before long, everyone walked into the mansion one after another. As the door slammed shut, it marked the beginning of this special meeting.
0:18:34|0:18:43|The group walked up the stairs as the guard pointed out each person's room.
0:18:54|0:18:58|[Li Ningyu] dragged [Gu Xiaomeng] towards the room.
0:18:59|0:19:8|Pushing the door open, [Gu Xiaomeng] didn't have time to inspect the exquisite furniture, and quickly walked towards the bathroom. She turned on the light, pushed open the door, and headed straight for the toilet.
0:19:9|0:19:21|In the living room, [Li Ningyu] looked around, deep in thought. The sound of flushing water came from the bathroom.
0:19:21|0:19:29|Several secret agents downstairs retreated to the steel bridge, accidentally making a noise. Half an hour had passed without anyone noticing.
0:19:29|0:19:34|[Li Ningyu] supported [Gu Xiaomeng] and quickly walked into the meeting room. [Jin Shenghuo] looked at the lottery ticket.
0:19:34|0:19:48|Everyone sat around a long table, each with a lottery ticket placed in front of them with a picture of an old man with a limp.
0:20:32|0:20:40|[Bai Xiaonian] revealed that the commander did not approve of this matter, and everyone started making jokes and teasing each other.
0:21:17|0:21:21|[Wu Zhiguo] stood up and snatched the newspaper that [Wang Tianxiang] was reading.
0:21:30|0:21:34|In the shadows, [Wu Tian] throws the original document onto the table.
0:21:36|0:21:43|[Wang Tianxiang] stood up first when she saw the familiar notebook. [Wu Tian] walked out from the shadows until the light illuminated his face.
0:22:1|0:22:9|[Wu Tian] scanned everyone with sharp eyes, and [Gu Xiaomeng], who hadn't sobered up yet, almost vomited again.
0:22:10|0:22:15|At the long table, [Wu Tian] sat high at the head, watching the progress of decryption by [Li Ningyu] and [Gu Xiaomeng].
0:22:15|0:22:24|As the leader of the electronic translation team, [Li Ningyu] found this task not difficult. She flipped through the original script and sketched it out.
0:23:0|0:23:9|[Li Ningyu] writes each combination on a piece of paper, constantly trying to piece it together.
0:23:15|0:23:18|Gu Xiaomeng, who had sobered up, stared at Li Ningyu with bleary eyes and asked.
0:23:19|0:23:25|[Li Ningyu] reorganizes the order.
0:23:26|0:23:33|Wu Tian looked up at Li Ningyu's expression. Meanwhile, the three men on the sofa suddenly became attentive as well.
0:23:33|0:23:42|The paper on the table with numbers written on it was now filled with corresponding Chinese characters. When the 14 characters were arranged into a coherent sentence, it read:
0:23:43|0:23:51|On October 31st, Gu Xiaomeng, Li Ningyu, Wu Zhiguo, Wu Tian, Wang Tianxiang, Jin Shenghuo, Bai Xiaonian, and Kusunoki Colonel gathered at Baicaotang to launch a surprise attack. The tense atmosphere spread instantly.
0:23:51|0:24:2|The crowd approached to find out the result, [Gu Xiaomeng] lit a cigarette, and when she looked up again, the crowd had already surrounded her.
0:24:2|0:24:9|[Li Ningyu] took a puff of smoke and said slowly. As soon as these words were spoken, the expressions of everyone present changed.
0:24:9|0:24:22|Wang Tianxiang on the sofa looked over and slowly stood up to walk over. He held up the translated cipher message with two fingers to show everyone.
0:24:38|0:24:45|[Wu Tian] looked at everyone with a winning hand. Upon hearing this, [Jin Shenghuo] showed an incredulous expression.
0:24:47|0:24:55|[Bai Xiaonian] stared with his eyes wide open, as if trying to identify the traitor.
0:24:59|0:25:6|This made everyone feel uneasy, and [Jin Shenghuo] quickly threw the untimely biscuit in his hand into the ashtray.
0:25:7|0:25:15|[Wu Tian] did not stay, and then walked away. Everyone kept staring until they couldn't see his figure anymore.
0:25:20|0:25:29|Gu Xiaomeng smiled, and Wang Tianxiang glared back.
0:25:29|0:25:39|[Gu Xiaomeng] couldn't help but cover her mouth and burst into laughter. As the night grew deeper, the mansion on this coastal path exuded a charming atmosphere.
0:25:39|0:25:48|A pair of binoculars is scanning the balconies of the suspects. In front of the window, [Wu Zhiguo] walks over, seemingly aware that someone is watching.
0:25:48|0:25:56|The owner of the telescope quickly changed the target. This time, the target under surveillance is [Li Ningyu], who is sitting at the window writing.
0:25:56|0:26:4|The owner of the telescope is [Wang Tianxiang]. He just put down the telescope and locked onto the next target. Vaguely through the window,
0:26:4|0:26:12|The figure lying on the bed, already drowsy, is none other than [Jin Shenghuo]. He suddenly hears a noise.
0:26:14|0:26:23|He immediately sat up, reaching for the gun under the pillow and looking outside. [Jin Shenghuo] was still somewhat uneasy.
0:26:23|0:26:30|He put on his clothes and grabbed a gun before heading out. In the quiet night, he was wide awake, looking around in all directions.
0:26:30|0:26:33|The leaked secret telegram made him feel very uneasy.
0:26:34|0:26:43|Director Wang and [Wu Tian]'s attitude made him particularly worried about whether he could safely leave here. On the other side, [Gu Xiaomeng] was lying on a silk bed wearing clothes.
0:26:43|0:26:51|Staring blankly at the ceiling, [Li Ningyu] was still sitting by the window, writing under the desk lamp. [Gu Xiaomeng] walked over and tapped [Li Ningyu] on the shoulder.
0:27:0|0:27:7|[Gu Xiaomeng] leaned over the table to deliberately amuse [Li Ningyu].
0:27:13|0:27:20|Li Ningyu, who was preparing to pour tea, stopped her movements and turned around to look at Gu Xiaomeng. She set down the teapot and handed over the teacup.
0:27:21|0:27:30|[Gu Xiaomeng] suddenly pointed at [Li Ningyu].
0:27:40|0:27:45|[Li Ningyu] looks in the mirror to check the opening under the armpit of the clothes.
0:27:47|0:27:55|[Gu Xiaomeng] said, taking out a sewing box. She squatted down to help [Li Ningyu] untie her qipao.
0:27:55|0:28:3|[Li Ningyu] took off the cheongsam and handed it to [Gu Xiaomeng]. She took the cheongsam, holding a needle and thread, and quickly walked over to sit cross-legged on the high-end sofa.
0:28:10|0:28:17|[Li Ningyu] sat down next to [Gu Xiaomeng] with her clothes on. [Gu Xiaomeng] was sewing, carefully observing [Li Ningyu].
0:28:23|0:28:28|[Gu Xiaomeng] blinked her beautiful eyes and looked at [Li Ningyu].
0:28:28|0:28:33|Li Ningyu looked back, only to see Gu Xiaomeng already bowing her head to work as a female laborer.
0:28:33|0:28:37|She reached out for the delicate little hand that was threading a needle.
0:28:38|0:28:46|With red eyes, [Li Ningyu] opened her mouth but didn't say anything. She opened her arms and threw herself into [Gu Xiaomeng]'s embrace, and [Gu Xiaomeng] gently held her.
0:28:49|0:28:58|Li Ningyu was actually worried about her missing boyfriend. Suddenly, a faint opera singing came from outside the window, catching Gu Xiaomeng's attention.
0:28:58|0:29:5|[Li Ningyu] stood up. She walked towards the balcony.
0:29:5|0:29:10|[Li Ningyu] gently opened the balcony door and stepped out. Singing on the adjacent balcony was [Wu Zhiguo].
0:29:45|0:29:52|[Li Ningyu] took out a delicate cigarette case, pulled out a red circle, and walked to the edge of the balcony.
0:29:55|0:30:2|[Wu Zhiguo] caught it with both hands and lit it for himself. The two of them puffed on their cigarettes, blowing out smoke rings. After a while, [Wu Zhiguo] cleared his throat.
0:30:21|0:30:28|[Wu Zhiguo] looked over and saw that [Gu Xiaomeng] had also arrived on the balcony at some point.
0:30:30|0:30:38|Even the balcony is bugged.
0:30:58|0:31:3|After speaking, [Gu Xiaomeng] playfully raised her eyebrows at [Wu Zhiguo].
0:31:3|0:31:10|[Wu Zhiguo] looked up and exhaled smoke, as if trying to release the worries in his heart.
0:31:10|0:31:16|[Wang Tianxiang] is monitoring in the distance, [Wu Tian] approaches and takes the binoculars.
0:31:20|0:31:23|Li Ningyu in the distance stared blankly downstairs.
0:31:23|0:31:32|[Wu Tian] returned the binoculars to [Wang Tianxiang], then turned and walked back into the house, with [Wang Tianxiang] following closely behind.
0:31:33|0:31:38|[Wang Tianxiang] didn't quite understand.
0:31:38|0:31:48|[Wu Tian] picked up a book and flipped through it.
0:32:0|0:32:8|Wu Tian put down the book and walked away. Wang Tianxiang was still trying to figure out how to identify these tough cases. Chinese characters appeared on the woven texture:
0:32:8|0:32:14|I was too careless and fell into a trap. The Japanese invaders must have set a trap at Baicaotang to capture and kill our comrades.
0:32:14|0:32:21|The message to cancel the operation must be sent out within 5 days, otherwise death is the only option.
0:32:22|0:32:29|On the small island surrounded by the sea, there are two gloomy buildings standing. This is where everyone is being held captive this time.
0:32:29|0:32:37|Sunlight streamed into [Bai Xiaonian]'s room. He sang opera, moving his body rhythmically in front of a mirror.
0:32:37|0:32:46|He twisted his orchid fingers in front of the mirror. Suddenly, he stopped and leaned in to tidy up his sideburns. His expression was focused.
0:32:46|0:32:52|With both hands fiddling together, looking like a big girl. [Bai Xiaonian] slowly walked down the stairs.
0:32:52|0:33:1|The crowd had already started dining.
0:33:7|0:33:10|Jin Shenghuo, who was eating heartily, suddenly choked upon hearing the words.
0:33:19|0:33:23|The breakfast is coming to an end amidst the intrigue and scheming.
0:33:23|0:33:35|In the exquisite room, [Gu Xiaomeng] sat at the dressing table, whistling as she painted her nails with new nail polish. She admired her beautiful hands in the mirror. Meanwhile,
0:33:35|0:33:40|Downstairs, the Japanese woman is singing for the Japanese army. On the single sofa next to her, [Kusunoki Colonel] is sitting.
0:34:40|0:34:52|On the other side, the door opened and the slender [Gu Xiaomeng] walked towards the guard post with a piece of paper in her hand.
0:35:9|0:35:16|[Gu Xiaomeng] rolled her eyes.
0:35:18|0:35:28|[Gu Xiaomeng] pressed against the guard's body and slipped the paper into the guard's jacket pocket.
0:35:50|0:35:58|[Gu Xiaomeng] carefully recalled it.
0:36:5|0:36:12|[Gu Xiaomeng] was quite surprised. She raised her eyebrows and looked elsewhere, saying somewhat reluctantly.
0:36:41|0:36:49|After saying that, she raised her beautiful eyes and raised her eyebrows. The sea breeze blew over the island.
0:36:49|0:36:55|A man walks across the iron bridge connecting two buildings.
0:37:7|0:37:13|The two sat on the sofa, each with an air of mutual respect.
0:37:13|0:37:18|[Wu Zhiguo] stood up and picked up his coat, ready to leave.
0:37:25|0:37:32|[Wu Zhiguo] stopped and waited impatiently for the rest of [Wang Tianxiang]'s words.
0:37:32|0:37:42|[Li Ningyu] walked through the doorway and passed by [Wu Zhiguo] who was coming out, without any interaction. She glanced sideways.
0:37:42|0:37:49|Wu Tian, next to the choir, also looked over. Li Ningyu on the sofa smoked a lady cigarette and said.
0:37:50|0:37:57|After speaking, she took a deep drag on her cigarette.
0:37:57|0:38:7|[Wang Tianxiang] looked at her with a hint of surprise. On the other side, [Wu Tian] was holding the letter written by [Gu Xiaomeng], carefully examining it in the sunlight.
0:38:17|0:38:24|[Wu Tian] leaned in, furrowing his brow as he looked at the list and said.
0:38:24|0:38:32|[Wu Tian] stood up and interrupted him.
0:39:0|0:39:8|[Wang Tianxiang] was overjoyed at the news. Inside the hall, the on-duty guard was sleeping against the railing.
0:39:9|0:39:18|Several people sat around the dining table, but none of them seemed interested. [Gu Xiaomeng] leaned forward, showing concern for [Li Ningyu].
0:39:18|0:39:27|[Li Ningyu] eased her expression and responded with a smile. [Jin Shenghuo] slammed the table, expressing indignation.
0:40:0|0:40:6|[Wu Zhiguo] smashed the wine bottle, and everyone immediately quieted down. He slowly stood up, his gaze sweeping over the crowd, and said harshly.
0:40:8|0:40:15|[Wu Zhiguo] sarcastically taunted [Gu Xiaomeng] in public and private.
0:40:15|0:40:21|Several people looked at each other in silence. [Gu Xiaomeng] walked quickly around the table.
0:40:29|0:40:32|[Wu Zhiguo] forcefully pulled open his collar, revealing the bullet hole on his chest.
0:40:40|0:40:46|[Gu Xiaomeng] frowned coldly and stood up to speak.
0:40:50|0:40:54|She leaned against the table without giving in.
0:41:24|0:41:27|Wu Zhiguo, a big chauvinist, couldn't help but show a hint of embarrassment on his face when he heard the words.
0:41:27|0:41:32|He pointed his index finger fiercely at [Gu Xiaomeng] and was about to leave the farce.
0:41:35|0:41:42|Unexpectedly, [Wang Tianxiang] who came from the dark stopped him and said with a smile. [Wu Zhiguo] had a cold expression.
0:41:42|0:41:46|Glancing sideways at [Wang Tianxiang], she turned around and went straight upstairs.
0:41:50|0:42:0|[Li Ningyu] stood up for [Gu Xiaomeng], then quickly took [Gu Xiaomeng] upstairs to the room. [Jin Shenghuo] wiped off some sweat and picked up the chopsticks.
0:42:4|0:42:11|After speaking, he looked at the expressions of the few people, trying to find a loophole. Chinese characters appeared again on the web-like texture:
0:42:11|0:42:17|It feels like no one can get out of here. Without extraordinary means, it's probably difficult to send out any messages.
0:42:17|0:42:25|The next day, [Wang Tianxiang] walked through the hall, turned on the record player, and quickly went upstairs with the documents.
0:42:35|0:42:41|Everyone received the documents personally delivered by [Wang Tianxiang].
0:42:43|0:42:50|Everyone is busy filling in their relevant information.
0:42:51|0:42:58|With either a fountain pen or a brush, the characters were meticulously written in regular script. [Gu Xiaomeng] turned her head to look at her friend [Li Ningyu],
0:42:58|0:43:5|[Li Ningyu] was found writing earnestly. [Gu Xiaomeng] and [Wu Zhiguo] on the other side vaguely felt that something was not quite right.
0:43:6|0:43:10|On the outdoor terrace, [Wang Tianxiang] stood blowing in the sea breeze, deep in thought.
0:43:10|0:43:18|While inside the house, [Wu Tian] is carefully examining the information. He throws the information to his two subordinates, who are looking at the lottery advertisement brought back that day.
0:43:18|0:43:26|Carefully compare the handwriting. Measure the length of strokes with a vernier caliper and observe the pen strokes with a magnifying glass.
0:43:26|0:43:35|Accurate measurements, precise comparisons, repeated tests. After who knows how long, finally a clue was found in the handwriting aspect.
0:43:36|0:43:42|On the other side, [Gu Xiaomeng] lit a cigarette, swaying her waist and dancing gracefully in the room.
0:43:42|0:43:53|The old record player exudes a tranquil atmosphere, with [Li Ningyu] covered in a blanket on the long sofa still immersed in dreams. With a graceful figure and full of beauty, [Gu Xiaomeng] leans back in the chair, lighting a cigarette.
0:43:53|0:44:1|Quietly looking at [Li Ningyu]. She seemed to be thinking, when did these leisurely days become precious. Unexpectedly, the power suddenly went out.
0:44:1|0:44:7|The room was pitch black. Then, the lights in the two buildings also went out one after another.
0:44:7|0:44:12|In the darkness, [Gu Xiaomeng] flicked the cigarette ash lightly. The footsteps outside woke up [Li Ningyu].
0:44:20|0:44:23|[Gu Xiaomeng] was puzzled and shook her head slightly. [Li Ningyu] got up and walked towards the door.
0:44:23|0:44:30|The sudden power outage gave her a sense of foreboding. She pressed her ear against the door, listening carefully.
0:44:33|0:44:40|It sounds like [Bai Xiaonian] has encountered an accident. [Li Ningyu] quickly ran to the balcony to look out.
0:44:40|0:44:49|On the iron bridge connecting two small paths, two secret agents with flashlights escort [Bai Xiaonian] away. Inside the house, [Gu Xiaomeng] also approaches and leans against the window to look out.
0:44:49|0:44:50|[Li Ningyu] looked flustered and didn't say anything.
0:44:52|0:44:58|In the dungeon, two people are dragging [Bai Xiaonian] from the front, while the secret agent behind him covers his mouth and holds a kerosene lamp.
0:44:58|0:45:6|Several people together pushed [Bai Xiaonian] into the elevator, and the elevator doors closed tightly. [Bai Xiaonian] struggled in vain as the elevator slowly descended.
0:45:6|0:45:11|[Bai Xiaonian] was brought to the edge of a large pool in a bathhouse. The secret agent threw a wooden board on the ground,
0:45:11|0:45:21|Then two henchmen brought in a tiger bench, trapping [Bai Xiaonian] in the chair. Across from him, [Wu Tian] sat casually playing with a cigarette in his hand.
0:45:26|0:45:34|Trapped, [Bai Xiaonian] stared in terror at two documents.
0:45:42|0:45:47|[Wang Tianxiang] smirked and stepped back, signaling to his men to begin.
0:45:47|0:45:54|Two secret agents each untie the hands and feet of [Bai Xiaonian]. He is extremely terrified. Another secret agent walks up and grabs [Bai Xiaonian] by the hair.
0:45:54|0:46:0|Dragging him step by step into another room, then ruthlessly throwing him on the ground. The door of the room slammed shut.
0:46:1|0:46:7|[Bai Xiaonian] looked up at [Director Wang], who looked like a demon from the abyss, and he was filled with extreme terror.
0:46:9|0:46:12|Two secret agents immediately followed suit. He screamed in despair.
0:46:12|0:46:19|In the corner, the spy is sharpening the iron spike bench, with one particularly sharp and thick in the middle.
0:46:19|0:46:24|[Wang Tianxiang] looked at the dignified colonel with a smile that came from the heart.
0:46:25|0:46:30|Outside the execution room, [Wu Tian] stood up and left after hearing the heart-wrenching screams.
0:46:30|0:46:35|He even thought about how [Bai Xiaonian] could calm Commander Zhang's anger if he wasn't a mole.
0:46:35|0:46:40|In fact, Commander Zhang, who was on a business trip in Nanjing, just received the news and rushed to Qiuzhuang.
0:46:41|0:46:48|The commander's car has just arrived, and [Wang Tianxiang] leads the team to greet. His attendants stopped the commander's bodyguards, only [Wang Tianxiang] entered the house.
0:46:49|0:46:57|[Wu Tian] and the commander sat upright. [Wang Tianxiang] approached, the commander glared fiercely and kicked [Wang Tianxiang] down with one foot.
0:46:57|0:47:4|[Wang Tianxiang] immediately stood up straight, and [Wu Tian] beside him couldn't help but burst into laughter.
0:47:8|0:47:15|Commander looked at [Wang Tianxiang] and then at [Wu Tian] with confusion. As Commander Zhang was about to question them, [Wu Tian] brought up Rear Admiral Kusunoki.
0:47:19|0:47:27|Hearing this, [Kusunoki Colonel] refrained from getting angry.
0:47:27|0:47:35|Wu Tian finished speaking and looked at [Wang Tianxiang].
0:47:36|0:47:43|At the urging of [Wu Tian], [Wang Tianxiang] turned and left. Before long, the commander sat in front of the lamp, carefully comparing the two handwriting samples.
0:47:52|0:47:59|The commander's tiger eyes stared at [Wu Tian], who, however, smiled confidently.
0:47:59|0:48:11|The commander, leaning on a crutch, walked slowly towards the interrogation room. He had to find [Bai Xiaonian] to get some answers.
0:48:11|0:48:17|Emerging from the pool, [Bai Xiaonian],
0:48:25|0:48:37|The commander swung his whip, leaving a cut on [Bai Xiaonian]'s face. [Bai Xiaonian], who had been waiting for a savior, was now completely broken inside. He sobbed as he crawled to the water pool, defiantly looking up at the commander.
0:48:37|0:48:50|In the dark building with a power outage, a figure carrying a lantern walks up the stairs.
0:48:50|0:48:57|For everyone, this was destined to be a sleepless night. In the darkness, [Wu Zhiguo] quietly smoked a cigarette.
0:48:57|0:49:0|[Gu Xiaomeng] and [Li Ningyu] are huddled together on a sofa.
0:49:0|0:49:8|The figure stopped in front of the door at this moment. In the room separated by a door, [Jin Shenghuo] sat on the sofa, raising a pistol nervously staring at the doorway.
0:49:8|0:49:18|Outside the door, the spy with the key turned to another door. Inside were [Gu Xiaomeng] and [Li Ningyu].
0:49:20|0:49:27|The knocking on the door struck the heart, [Li Ningyu] stopped [Gu Xiaomeng] and went to open the door herself. The flashlight shone directly on her face.
0:49:32|0:49:40|In the dark night, [Li Ningyu] walked towards the car alone, wrapped in clothes. Upstairs, [Gu Xiaomeng] looked on nervously.
0:49:40|0:49:48|She didn't expect that misfortune would come so quickly to her side. In another building, a woman in a kimono led the way.
0:49:48|0:49:54|[Li Ningyu] followed him through the hall, passing by the choir, and arrived at a door with a painting hanging on it.
0:49:54|0:49:58|The woman in kimono opened the door skillfully and walked in first.
0:50:0|0:50:6|Moonlight spilled down, imprinting [Li Ningyu]'s exquisite profile on the hanging scroll. After a moment of hesitation, she followed suit and entered the room.
0:50:7|0:50:15|The woman in kimono carried the lamp prepared at the door and walked deeper into the darkness. In the pitch-black alley, [Li Ningyu] could only follow the only source of light.
0:50:16|0:50:20|Approaching the corner, the woman in kimono was very polite, making a gesture of invitation.
0:50:20|0:50:27|[Li Ningyu] walked ahead, with [Gu Xiaomeng] following behind, holding a lantern high until the two entered the elevator.
0:50:29|0:50:36|Before long, the elevator doors opened and the two of them walked out slowly. She walked along the damp corridor in high heels.
0:50:36|0:50:44|The environment here is hard to describe in words. It's more like a hole punched out by a giant rat, gloomy, dark, and damp.
0:50:48|0:50:54|The woman in kimono stopped and asked [Li Ningyu] to wait here while she signaled the guard to open the door. The wooden sign next to them was painted with,
0:50:55|0:51:3|No entry allowed for danger. This time, the woman in kimono did not lead the way. As [Li Ningyu] stepped into the door, the heavy iron gate was already locked.
0:51:4|0:51:12|[Li Ningyu] glanced around the room and saw [Wu Tian] sitting in the middle of the chair in a kimono. [Wu Tian] closed the book in his arms and looked at her with a smile.
0:51:13|0:51:28|And at this moment in the hall, [Wang Tianxiang] grabbed the kerosene lamp and headed straight upstairs.
0:51:59|0:52:2|[Wang Tianxiang] quickly picked up the kerosene lamp and hurried away.
0:52:5|0:52:14|In the interrogation room, [Wu Tian] gazed at the curvaceous figure under [Li Ningyu]'s cheongsam. Standing under the light, [Li Ningyu] nodded.
0:52:16|0:52:21|She looked at [Wu Tian] with great vigilance. After learning about the whereabouts of her long-lost boyfriend,
0:52:21|0:52:24|[Li Ningyu] couldn't help but ask.
0:52:24|0:52:31|Wu Tian walked towards [Li Ningyu], who stared at him with eyes full of disgust and dissatisfaction.
0:52:31|0:52:35|She was not sure what medicine this man was selling.
0:52:35|0:52:47|At that time, [Wang Tianxiang] carried a lamp and personally went to the other side of the building to investigate the situation of [Gu Xiaomeng]. The soldier saluted.
0:52:57|0:53:9|The soldier walked towards the door, [Wang Tianxiang] casually placed the lamp on the table, and hid in the dark to observe. Just as the soldier raised his hand, the door was opened, and out came the disheveled [Wu Zhiguo].
0:53:10|0:53:18|[Wu Zhiguo] frowned and waved his hand.
0:53:19|0:53:30|With that, [Wu Zhiguo] ignored the soldiers and walked towards his room. In the interrogation room, there was a book on human anatomy placed on the desk.
0:53:30|0:53:36|Wu Tian picked up the lottery advertisement on the table and looked at [Li Ningyu]. Finally, he tore it up.
0:54:22|0:54:26|Wu Tian stared intently at Li Ningyu in front of him, as if trying to see through this woman.
0:54:26|0:54:36|On the other side, [Wang Tianxiang] came to [Gu Xiaomeng]'s room and knocked on the door, but there was no response from inside.
0:54:36|0:54:39|Wang Tianxiang continued to persistently ask.
0:54:40|0:54:43|The room was still silent.
0:54:43|0:54:51|[Wang Tianxiang] was eager to know what was going on, but also worried that being too obvious would expose the listening devices. Just then, [Gu Xiaomeng] opened the door.
0:55:0|0:55:8|Gu Xiaomeng, who was about to close the door, was stopped by Wang Tianxiang. Wang Tianxiang took out a box of snacks for her.
0:55:16|0:55:26|She gently took the snacks handed to her by [Wang Tianxiang] and cursed under her breath. Meanwhile, in the interrogation room, [Wu Tian] brought in a box.
0:55:26|0:55:34|The box is not big, but when opened, it is fully equipped with tools, like a medical kit. Inside, there are three small drawers.
0:55:36|0:55:42|Every layer is densely packed with stainless steel tools. [Wu Tian] takes out a small knife from among them.
0:55:45|0:55:53|[Wu Tian] selects tools from the box.
0:56:2|0:56:11|He calmly put on the white gloves, as if preparing for an important surgery. He walked over with his tools,
0:56:21|0:56:28|[Wu Tian] reached out to unbutton [Li Ningyu]'s collar, but she dodged backwards.
0:56:29|0:56:35|[Li Ningyu] stubbornly turned her head to look elsewhere in the end.
0:56:35|0:56:41|Tears rolled down the beautiful face of [Li Ningyu], as she tilted her head back, trying hard to hold back the tears.
0:56:42|0:56:49|The buttons of the cheongsam from the collar to the hem were all unbuttoned by [Wu Tian]. [Wu Tian] gently took off her cheongsam, muttering to himself.
0:56:52|0:56:58|Stripped of her cheongsam, [Li Ningyu] was left with only two thin pieces of underwear. [Wu Tian] continued to brainwash with anatomical knowledge.
0:57:0|0:57:5|[Li Ningyu] collapsed, standing naked in front of this person at the moment. [Wu Tian] slowly lifted her head.
0:57:13|0:57:28|He took out a caliper to measure the size of Li Ningyu's nose, then the mouth, step by step down to the ankle. Li Ningyu's privacy and dignity were completely lost at this moment.
0:57:31|0:57:39|Li Ningyu recalls the first time she saw the stage actor Liu Linzong.
0:57:46|0:57:53|At that moment, she was joyfully watching him from the audience, and as their eyes met, sparks of love ignited.
0:57:53|0:58:1|In the dungeon, [Bai Xiaonian] has become a floating corpse, drifting in a dirty pool. With the power outage tonight, too much has already happened.
0:58:2|0:58:8|The characters appeared on the net texture again: there is already a plan, just need a little help from above.
0:58:9|0:58:16|The commander sat back on the sofa with his eyes closed.
0:58:32|0:58:44|Bai Xiaonian's death left the commander somewhat distracted.
0:58:45|0:59:2|Takeda on the side sofa nodded unwillingly, then gestured to the soldier.
0:59:3|0:59:12|[Wang Tianxiang] lowered her head, afraid of angering the commander again. [Wu Tian] solemnly adjusted his gloves.
0:59:22|0:59:29|His gaze was sharp, staring ahead, [Wu Tian], who thirsted for the glory of the family, was about to embark on a grand ambition. One morning a month ago,
0:59:39|0:59:46|The military officers in the meeting room called out his name again and again. [Wu Tian] looked up and slowly stood up.
0:59:48|0:59:56|The officer's face changed, his mouth twitched. The officer didn't get angry but smiled instead.
0:59:59|1:0:7|He suddenly restrained his smile.
1:0:8|1:0:22|The officer's voice grew louder as he crushed the honor of the Wu family in front of a group of senior generals.
1:0:22|1:0:27|[Wu Tian] did not offer any explanation, but simply stared at him intensely as he sat down slowly.
1:0:28|1:0:35|Just as [Wu Tian], who had just sat down, suddenly pushed himself up with both hands, leaped onto the table, and pounced on the senior officer who had just mocked him.
1:0:36|1:0:42|Wu Tian pinned him to the ground, venting his anger, while other officers rushed up to pull them apart.
1:0:42|1:0:49|And when the officer was helped up, his face was pierced by a pen.
1:0:50|1:0:59|The scene shifts, with Wu Tian wearing a cloak, standing on the rooftop gazing into the distance. [Wang Tianxiang] walks up from behind, frowning and bowing to report to Wu Tian.
1:1:0|1:1:6|The two observed the situation through binoculars.
1:1:25|1:1:34|Wu Tian put down the telescope and came up with a plan, saying to the frowning [Wang Tianxiang].
1:1:34|1:1:39|[Wang Tianxiang] immediately understood and walked out with his entourage.
1:1:39|1:1:47|In the room, [Gu Xiaomeng] is sitting on the sofa sewing, while [Wu Zhiguo] and [Jin Shenghuo] at the other end are boredly playing chess.
1:1:47|1:1:56|At this moment, [Wang Tianxiang] walked out.
1:2:11|1:2:19|On the open space of the cliff in Qiu Zhuang, a long table is set up, with a band playing by the railing and kimono-clad women dancing ahead.
1:2:20|1:2:29|[Wu Zhiguo] applauded as Wu Tian stood up to speak. Wu Tian, dressed in a suit, stood up. After speaking, he picked up a glass of clear liquor and drank it all in one gulp.
1:2:29|1:2:36|[Wang Tianxiang] smoked a cigarette, squinting his eyes as he looked into the distance. In the distance, the head chef was assigning tasks to the cripple, he said.
1:2:38|1:2:44|This was arranged early by [Wang Tianxiang], who was secretly observing the progress of the plan.
1:2:44|1:2:49|[Li Ningyu] is burying her head in drinking, pouring foreign liquor into her mouth.
1:2:49|1:2:57|Old Lu, holding a cigarette and a tray, limped towards the dining table. He comically swayed his body and arrived next to [Wu Zhiguo].
1:2:57|1:3:4|Putting down the tray, he bent down to pick up the bone plate. Beside him, [Wu Zhiguo] sat smoking indifferently by the chair.
1:3:4|1:3:11|Old Lu put away the bone disc and walked over to [Jin Shenghuo]. He slowly bent down to pick up a chopstick from the ground and stood up.
1:3:11|1:3:20|[Gu Xiaomeng] also collected the other chopstick from [Jin Shenghuo]'s hand and put it into the tray. Then, he picked up the remaining dish with both hands and put it back on the tray.
1:3:20|1:3:28|[Jin Shenghuo] deliberately gave up his seat, while [Wang Tianxiang] kept a close eye on every move. At this moment, Lao Lu came to [Li Ningyu]'s side.
1:3:29|1:3:36|[ Jin Shenghuo ] looked at her in confusion.
1:3:40|1:3:46|She shouted loudly at Director [Wang] who was being stared at by everyone.
1:3:49|1:3:51|Lao Lu quickly arranged the tray and avoided [Li Ningyu].
1:3:51|1:4:5|Facing the gaze of [Li Ningyu], Director Wang responded with a smile, while [Wu Tian] picked up a cigarette and prepared to light it. [Li Ningyu] then flipped one plate after another onto [Wu Tian].
1:4:24|1:4:34|He reluctantly threw away the match and spat. Back in the room, [Wang Tianxiang] was sitting at the table.
1:4:37|1:4:44|Beside the curtain, [Wu Tian] who was looking around turned and walked back.
1:4:55|1:4:58|[Wang Tianxiang] looked pale and swallowed hard.
1:5:44|1:5:54|[Wang Tianxiang] felt that he had seized the opportunity and was extremely excited.
1:5:55|1:6:3|[Wu Tian] lit a cigarette, sitting across from [Wang Tianxiang] who picked up a match, bent over and lit the cigarette for [Wu Tian]. Once the cigarette was lit,
1:6:3|1:6:14|Wu Tian took a sip and stared into Wang Tianxiang's eyes. The special agents raided the room.
1:6:18|1:6:26|In the West Tower interrogation room, a group of people gathered around a long table.
1:6:26|1:6:32|There is the body of [Bai Xiaonian] on the table. [Wang Tianxiang] paces around the table, casting a glance at the military officers present.
1:7:2|1:7:9|[Jin Shenghuo] was overwhelmed by this aura and was at a loss for words.
1:7:39|1:7:42|[Jin Shenghuo] pulled out a gun to threaten the secret agent and [Wang Tianxiang].
1:7:43|1:7:50|[Jin Shenghuo] is scared, his hand holding the gun trembles slightly.
1:8:1|1:8:10|[Jin Shenghuo] aimed at his temple and shot himself, committing suicide. His colleagues who had been together day and night died at this moment, leaving everyone feeling heavy-hearted.
1:8:11|1:8:23|[Wang Tianxiang], who had checked the body, turned and left, leaving everyone stunned in place. Night fell.
1:8:23|1:8:26|Night will soon fall on this small island.
1:8:26|1:8:36|In the interrogation room, two bodies lay horizontally, with frequent changes happening in just two days. The once high-ranking officers of the headquarters not only lost their former spirits at this moment,
1:8:36|1:8:45|One by one, they were exhausted and fearful. This is just the beginning. The sound of the door being smashed startled everyone in the interrogation room.
1:8:57|1:9:6|[Li Ningyu] was taken away by two secret agents without a word. [Gu Xiaomeng] looked on in confusion at Captain Wu.
1:9:6|1:9:23|[Li Ningyu], who was taken out, walked through the dim and damp corridor. She couldn't resist, let alone fight back, and was dragged all the way to the corner. The leading special agent stopped. [Li Ningyu] trembled like a sieve.
1:9:25|1:9:31|After a warning, two special agents escorted [Li Ningyu] towards the elevator. Once inside, soldiers closed the two elevator doors.
1:9:37|1:9:41|The elevator slowly ascended, taking [Li Ningyu] away from this earthly purgatory.
1:9:41|1:9:46|Meanwhile, in the office upstairs, [Wang Tianxiang] and [Wu Tian] are sitting on the sofa.
1:9:46|1:9:55|On the other side, the eavesdropper wearing headphones was ready to record at any moment.
1:9:58|1:10:7|[Wu Tian] leaned against the sofa without saying a word, listening to the tape in the bug machine spinning.
1:10:57|1:11:4|[Gu Xiaomeng] was being choked by [Wu Zhiguo].
1:11:7|1:11:16|[Wang Tianxiang] picked up a wooden chair and knocked out [Wu Zhiguo]. In the living room, [Wang Tianxiang] brought a cup of tea for [Gu Xiaomeng].
1:11:16|1:11:23|Sitting down, watching the haggard Gu Xiaomeng. Gu Xiaomeng had red eyes, and her lips were trembling.
1:11:24|1:11:32|The continuous pressure over the past few days has gradually worn down [Gu Xiaomeng]'s spirit. Wiping away her tears, [Gu Xiaomeng] reached into the coat beside her and pulled out a handkerchief.
1:11:32|1:11:39|She gently opened the handkerchief, inside wrapped a slightly wrinkled cigarette. [Wang Tianxiang] reached out to take the cigarette.
1:11:39|1:11:47|[Gu Xiaomeng] calmed down a bit and reminisced.
1:11:48|1:11:55|Yesterday at the dining table, the cigarette was stepped on by [Gu Xiaomeng] with her heel.
1:11:56|1:11:58|The sound of the door opening interrupted their conversation.
1:11:58|1:12:4|Walking through the door in military uniform is [Wu Tian]. He strides forward,
1:12:4|1:12:11|Reaching out to take the cigarette from [Wang Tianxiang], then pulling out a magnifying glass from his pocket and carefully examining it up close.
1:12:11|1:12:19|There are several regular small holes on the cigarette. [Wu Tian] guessed with his sensitive professional sense.
1:12:27|1:12:34|In the gloomy execution room, [Wang Tianxiang] paced back and forth.
1:12:34|1:12:42|He picked up the cigarette. [Wu Zhiguo] was stripped of his shirt, with his hands and feet tied to a pillar.
1:12:45|1:12:51|He has just been tortured and his body is covered with scars.
1:12:51|1:12:55|Wu Zhiguo explained in a hoarse voice.
1:13:5|1:13:12|Surrounded by secret agents grabbing their weapons, getting ready to move forward. [Wang Tianxiang] raised her hand to stop them.
1:13:12|1:13:21|The leading spy signaled and the motor shook, crackling current passing through [Wu Zhiguo]'s body. He was in extreme pain.
1:13:21|1:13:30|Muscles all over the body were shaking uncontrollably under the voltage. The special agent shook even more vigorously.
1:13:41|1:13:51|[Wu Zhiguo]’s body was still convulsing uncontrollably.
1:13:54|1:13:59|[Wu Zhiguo] lowered his head, gritted his teeth, and gasped for breath. The high-intensity electric shock left him with a vacant stare.
1:14:10|1:14:16|The spy stepped forward to untie [Wu Zhiguo]. As soon as the belts around his neck and hands were loosened, he collapsed.
1:14:16|1:14:24|The characters slowly emerge on the textured fabric: Whether the message is transmitted or not, success or failure lies in today.
1:14:24|1:14:31|The handwriting slowly disappears. In the room, [Gu Xiaomeng] who is mending clothes, cuts the thin thread with scissors.
1:14:31|1:14:37|Reorganize the plot, connect the dots. Two black-clad secret agents downstairs are let through by the guards.
1:14:37|1:14:46|The haggard [Li Ningyu] by the window, upon seeing it, couldn't help but hide in fear. She called out [Gu Xiaomeng]'s name with a vacant look in her eyes.
1:14:46|1:14:55|Turning around and looking at Gu Xiaomeng, who had put down the work in her hands. She walked over lightly, squatted down beside Gu Xiaomeng, and looked at him with empty eyes.
1:15:13|1:15:21|With a vacant look in her eyes, [Li Ningyu] reached out and embraced [Gu Xiaomeng]'s neck, leaning in to whisper softly in her ear.
1:15:21|1:15:31|The two characters, [Gu Xiaomeng] and [Li Ningyu], who are as close as sisters, lean their heads against each other with calm expressions.
1:15:31|1:15:37|[Li Ningyu] slowly moved her head away from [Gu Xiaomeng]'s shoulder. [Gu Xiaomeng] lowered her head, pretending not to see.
1:15:37|1:15:46|[Li Ningyu] looked at [Gu Xiaomeng] with lifeless eyes. [Gu Xiaomeng] draped the mended cheongsam over [Li Ningyu].
1:15:46|1:15:53|[Li Ningyu] stood up and squatted down to help [Li Ningyu] button up. [Li Ningyu] looked down at her, meeting [Li Ningyu]'s gaze.
1:15:53|1:16:1|[Gu Xiaomeng] thought for a moment and pointed under the table. [Li Ningyu] slowly bent down and looked under the table.
1:16:1|1:16:7|She glanced slightly and saw a round small electronic bug stuck to the bottom of the coffee table.
1:16:7|1:16:16|[Gu Xiaomeng] quickly walked to the corner cabinet. She opened the drawer, took out some tape, and tore off a piece casually.
1:16:16|1:16:25|Stick the bug installed on the bookshelf. Then quickly walk over and put tape on the bug under the coffee table. [Gu Xiaomeng] has no intention of stopping.
1:16:25|1:16:30|Under the gaze of [Li Ningyu], he walked to a table not far away and pasted on some tape.
1:16:31|1:16:37|Then, she casually picked up the cigarette on the table and waved it towards [Li Ningyu]. [Gu Xiaomeng] walked towards the bathroom.
1:16:37|1:16:41|Seeing [Li Ningyu] still standing there, [Wu Zhiguo] waved his hand to signal her to come over.
1:16:41|1:16:47|[Gu Xiaomeng] walked into the bathroom, while [Li Ningyu] watched her figure warily.
1:16:47|1:16:54|[Gu Xiaomeng] paced back and forth in the bathroom. When [Li Ningyu] walked in, she gently closed the door and took out a cigarette to light up.
1:16:54|1:17:0|[Li Ningyu] looked around, while [Gu Xiaomeng] leaned against the door frame watching [Li Ningyu].
1:17:2|1:17:10|After speaking, she took out a lighter and lit a cigarette for herself. [Li Ningyu] slowly turned her head and approached [Gu Xiaomeng]. When she got close, she said.
1:17:12|1:17:18|[Li Ningyu]'s hollow eyes became unusually determined. The smoke wafted in the small bathroom.
1:17:20|1:17:24|This is all too unexpected for [Gu Xiaomeng], she stood there in a daze and even forgot to smoke.
1:17:24|1:17:30|The wise may have a thousand worries, but at this moment, [Gu Xiaomeng] smiled.
1:17:34|1:17:39|In the prison cell, the soldier opened the door and invited [Gu Xiaomeng] in. [Gu Xiaomeng] entered with a smile on her face, hunched over and holding a box.
1:17:39|1:17:45|A group of secret agents surrounded the platform, and the muscular man lying on the platform with his upper body naked is [Wu Zhiguo].
1:17:53|1:18:1|[Gu Xiaomeng] ran to a small table on the side with a big smile on her face, and opened the box.
1:18:1|1:18:9|[Wu Zhiguo] tried to struggle, but was firmly held down by the secret agent. [Gu Xiaomeng] carefully selected medicines and silver needles in the box.
1:18:36|1:18:43|[Gu Xiaomeng] pulled out the bottle stopper, inserted the selected silver needle into her finger, and gently stirred.
1:18:46|1:18:53|[Gu Xiaomeng] approached [Wu Zhiguo] with a silver needle, and the needle suddenly pierced into the acupoint on [Wu Zhiguo]'s ankle.
1:18:53|1:19:5|With a gentle flick of the silver needle by [Gu Xiaomeng]'s fingertips, [Wu Zhiguo] widened his eyes and opened his mouth, his eye sockets extremely bloodshot with pain. [Wang Tianxiang] stepped forward to interrogate.
1:19:7|1:19:12|[Wu Zhiguo] had a frozen expression, with his entire head gently twitching.
1:19:13|1:19:32|[Gu Xiaomeng] ran her fingers over the silver needles, selecting one as fine as a strand of hair. She lightly dipped it into a small bottle of medicine and then inserted it into his waist. [Wu Zhiguo]'s eye sockets began to bleed, his mouth involuntarily twitching with composure.
1:19:34|1:19:42|[Gu Xiaomeng] gently twirled the silver needle. On the other side, in the bathroom,
1:19:42|1:19:49|[Li Ningyu] stared intensely at [Gu Xiaomeng]. [Gu Xiaomeng] nodded vigorously, and [Li Ningyu] moved closer.
1:19:50|1:19:55|[Li Ningyu] said with red eyes full of deep hatred and disgust.
1:19:55|1:19:59|[Gu Xiaomeng] gently tapped the cigarette, waiting for the follow-up from [Li Ningyu].
1:19:59|1:20:6|[Li Ningyu] then relaxed her face and looked at her familiar colleague. [Gu Xiaomeng] took a puff of her cigarette.
1:20:8|1:20:15|[Gu Xiaomeng] licked her lips, took a deep breath, and said somewhat helplessly.
1:20:27|1:20:35|[Gu Xiaomeng] said sincerely. [Li Ningyu] slapped a crisp slap on [Gu Xiaomeng]'s face.
1:20:35|1:20:45|[Gu Xiaomeng] slowly lowered her head, and [Li Ningyu] pushed her against the wall.
1:20:48|1:20:53|She pressed against [Gu Xiaomeng]'s face and asked sternly.
1:20:55|1:21:2|She pushed [Gu Xiaomeng] away in despair. [Li Ningyu], who felt abandoned by everyone, pulled open the bathroom door.
1:21:18|1:21:24|[Li Ningyu] was in extreme conflict, almost going crazy standing in place. While [Gu Xiaomeng] stood at the door, smiling at her.
1:21:24|1:21:31|Before long, she couldn't help but burst into tears.
1:22:4|1:22:10|The two sat on the edge of the bed, finally baring their hearts.
1:22:10|1:22:17|The intimate couple was separated by their positions, tears streaming down their two beautiful faces without reservation. In the execution room,
1:22:17|1:22:24|Another silver needle rotated and inserted into the blue veins on Wu Zhiguo's temple. He could hardly keep his eyes open.
1:22:24|1:22:33|The bloodstains on the eyes, ears, mouth, and nose confirmed the toughness of this man.
1:22:34|1:22:44|He grinned and closed his eyes. [Wang Tianxiang] leaned in close to his ear.
1:22:46|1:22:50|[Wu Zhiguo] continued to taunt him. [Wang Tianxiang] looked angrily at Lord Six.
1:22:50|1:22:57|Uncle Liu quickly stepped forward to probe Wu Zhiguo, and stabbed another needle in his chest. Wu Zhiguo's neck, forehead, and bones protruded.
1:22:57|1:23:5|He raised his body and spurted blood with determination.
1:23:7|1:23:15|Here, [Li Ningyu] is tearfully persuading [Gu Xiaomeng]. [Gu Xiaomeng] continues with a sense of guilt.
1:23:15|1:23:24|The heavily guarded Qiu Village is difficult to obtain intelligence from.
1:23:34|1:23:40|[Li Ningyu] pulled [Gu Xiaomeng] up and asked, with his arm around her neck.
1:23:48|1:23:52|[Gu Xiaomeng] watched as the person who was like a real sister to her was filled with tears, and tears fell from her own eyes as well.
1:23:52|1:23:57|Saying that, [Li Ningyu] tightly held [Gu Xiaomeng]'s hand.
1:23:58|1:24:3|[Gu Xiaomeng] forced a smile and gently embraced [Li Ningyu]. The pain of parting and death,
1:24:3|1:24:12|She can't even put on a smile.
1:24:28|1:24:33|[Li Ningyu] tightly pursed her lips and shook her head gently. Meanwhile, in the execution room,
1:24:33|1:24:42|[Wu Zhiguo] lay on the ground motionless. Lao Liu went forward to check his condition and then reported back.
1:24:42|1:24:52|He looked down at [Wu Zhiguo] and continued.
1:24:56|1:25:3|Uncle Liu was left speechless by the question. After a moment of reaction, he swallowed his saliva, squatted down, and stared at [Wu Zhiguo]'s head for a while.
1:25:3|1:25:7|Pointed to the Baihui acupoint with fingers, then gave a questioning look.
1:25:7|1:25:10|[Wang Tianxiang] nodded with narrowed eyes.
1:25:10|1:25:17|Uncle Liu held a fine needle dipped in medicine, gently bent down, slowly adjusted the angle, and found the acupoint.
1:25:17|1:25:24|This position is something he hasn't tried in a long time. Just saw Lord Liu gently push aside [Wu Zhiguo]'s hair,
1:25:24|1:25:30|[Wang Tianxiang] also approached to take a closer look. Voices could be heard from outside the door.
1:25:33|1:25:35|Liu Ye and [Wang Tianxiang] both turned their heads to look.
1:25:35|1:25:44|The soldier opened the iron gate, and walking towards them was [Li Ningyu]. She looked gloomy and walked heavily, while [Wang Tianxiang] smoked a cigarette and approached with some confusion.
1:25:44|1:25:52|[Li Ningyu] took a step forward and raised her hand, holding a crumpled cigarette box in her palm. She slowly opened her hand and said.
1:25:52|1:25:58|She handed the cigarette case to [Wang Tianxiang] with a hint of tears in her voice.
1:25:58|1:26:6|[Wang Tianxiang] carefully examines the cigarette case, which is exactly the one from Sanpaotai. It is at this moment that [Wang Tianxiang] finally realizes.
1:26:6|1:26:13|In the hospital, a nurse is pushing a stretcher, and the person lying on it is none other than the wrongly accused [Wu Zhiguo].
1:26:13|1:26:22|The stretcher is quickly pushed into the operating room by medical staff. The spy closes the door of the operating room and stands guard outside.
1:26:22|1:26:30|The doctor and nurse gently moved [Wu Zhiguo] from the stretcher to the operating table, and quickly put on gloves to prepare surgical supplies.
1:26:32|1:26:42|The doctor pinched the ankle and pulled out the silver needle, followed by the silver needles in the chest, waist, and finally the silver needle in the temple.
1:26:42|1:26:50|The doctors worked together to turn [Wu Zhiguo] over. One of the doctors used tweezers to pull out the silver needle that was bent in [Wu Zhiguo]'s back.
1:26:50|1:27:1|Blood spurted out like a small fountain from the needle hole. Semi-conscious [Wu Zhiguo] hummed a little tune.
1:27:35|1:27:45|The salty sea breeze blew through the Qiu Zhuang building.
1:27:45|1:27:55|In the gloomy underground execution chamber, the secret agent was using an iron brush to roughen the coarse hemp rope hanging, while [Gu Xiaomeng], with barely any clothes to cover her body, was sitting on the ground.
1:27:55|1:28:4|A dipper of cold water was poured over her head, wet hair covering her pretty face.
1:28:15|1:28:20|[Wang Tianxiang] grabbed [Gu Xiaomeng]'s hair and lifted her up. [Gu Xiaomeng] was gasping heavily.
1:28:20|1:28:27|She, with her consciousness blurred, has lost control of her body, swaying as others pull her.
1:28:32|1:28:40|Wang Tianxiang, in a fit of anger, pushed Gu Xiaomeng away.
1:28:41|1:28:56|The operatives stepped forward to support [Gu Xiaomeng], propping her up next to a thick hemp rope. They spread [Gu Xiaomeng]'s legs apart and helped her ride on the rough-hewn hemp rope, pushing her forward to rub against it. [Gu Xiaomeng]'s lower body suffered a brutal blow.
1:28:58|1:29:1|The spy pushed her back, sliding her away.
1:29:1|1:29:7|This is a barbaric punishment for women, the rope torture. [Wu Tian] also arrived at the execution room at this time.
1:29:7|1:29:13|The blood-soaked hemp rope hanging there made [Wang Tianxiang] shudder at the sight.
1:29:14|1:29:22|[Wu Tian] pulled the tablecloth, scattering objects all over the table.
1:29:22|1:29:33|He gently covered the groaning Gu Xiaomeng, who was already like a frightened bird, with a tablecloth, and Gu Xiaomeng, holding her lower body, moved back to hide.
1:29:39|1:29:46|In a dim interrogation room, the clock points to 8:30. [Gu Xiaomeng], who has changed clothes, leans against the chair with disheveled hair.
1:29:47|1:29:54|Her hands were handcuffed behind the chair back.
1:29:54|1:29:58|She licked her dry lips, while [Wu Tian] ignored what was said.
1:30:11|1:30:18|With a pale complexion and clear eyes, [Gu Xiaomeng] looked up at [Wu Tian].
1:30:18|1:30:24|[Wu Tian] looked at her expectantly, eager to get the information.
1:30:34|1:30:39|[Gu Xiaomeng] spoke more, the smile on her face grew brighter.
1:30:39|1:30:46|[Wu Tian] looked down from above, his eyes sharp as he stared at the prisoner below. Taking a deep breath, he turned his back and lit a cigarette.
1:30:46|1:30:49|Then he turned around and lit a cigarette.
1:30:49|1:30:56|He gently slid the match.
1:31:4|1:31:18|[Gu Xiaomeng] glared angrily at [Wu Tian]. A sense of foreboding rose in [Gu Xiaomeng]'s heart.
1:31:21|1:31:28|Wu Tian listened for a while before putting down the earpiece, then looked at the clock.
1:31:39|1:31:48|[Gu Xiaomeng], who was struggling frantically on the chair, was firmly held down by the secret agent. [Wu Tian] put the earpiece to [Gu Xiaomeng]'s ear.
1:31:58|1:32:7|[Gu Xiaomeng] had her hair disheveled, lowered her head, and cried softly.
1:32:7|1:32:17|[Wu Tian] waited for her answer.
1:32:17|1:32:23|[Gu Xiaomeng] nodded repeatedly.
1:32:23|1:32:27|[Wu Tian] put down the gun leaning against her head and picked up the microphone.
1:32:34|1:32:49|Wu Tian handed the earpiece to his subordinate after speaking, then also switched off the safety of his gun. Gu Xiaomeng adjusted her emotions and straightened her posture.
1:32:49|1:33:0|[Wu Tian] also walked to her front, waiting for her confession.
1:33:1|1:33:11|She thought for a moment and continued.
1:33:13|1:33:21|[Gu Xiaomeng] did not refuse, but also made a request.
1:33:26|1:33:31|Immediately, [Wu Tian] gave a glance to the nearby secret agent, who then turned around and left.
1:33:34|1:33:41|[Wu Tian] looked coldly at [Gu Xiaomeng], who lowered her eyes and shook her head as she gazed at the ground.
1:33:58|1:34:6|[Gu Xiaomeng] had needles pulled out from her bound hands, while her hands behind her back attempted to pick the lock.
1:34:8|1:34:15|[Wu Tian] glared angrily at [Gu Xiaomeng].
1:34:16|1:34:24|At the same time, [Kusunoki Colonel] limped back to the building. With his bodyguards behind him, he strode into the room.
1:34:24|1:34:33|[Wang Tianxiang] stood up to greet. [Wang Tianxiang] stood silently, angering the commander.
1:34:34|1:34:38|At this moment, in the interrogation room, [Gu Xiaomeng] is trying to pick the handcuffs with a needle.
1:34:38|1:34:45|Wu Tian, with his back to her, helplessly smoked a cigarette.
1:34:47|1:34:52|[Gu Xiaomeng] took the opportunity to provoke [Wu Tian].
1:34:57|1:35:5|[Wu Tian] looked at [Gu Xiaomeng] with interest.
1:35:5|1:35:10|He took the cigarette from his mouth, leaned close to [Gu Xiaomeng]'s face, and smiled as he spoke.
1:35:14|1:35:20|[Wu Tian] also realized [Gu Xiaomeng]'s intention of provocation.
1:35:20|1:35:31|[Gu Xiaomeng] attracted [Wu Tian]'s attention while quietly unlocking the handcuffs. [Wu Tian] became angry and laughed sarcastically.
1:35:31|1:35:41|He grabbed [Gu Xiaomeng] by the neck.
1:35:42|1:35:55|[Gu Xiaomeng] wrapped her hands around [Wu Tian]'s neck and bit his ear. As [Wang Tianxiang] rushed in, he had already pulled the trigger.
1:35:55|1:36:6|Gu Xiaomeng, who was shot three times, slid down from Wu Tian and fell on the cold floor. Wang Tianxiang and the commander looked at Gu Xiaomeng in the pool of blood.
1:36:14|1:36:20|At this moment, everyone present felt the determination of the Communist Party members.
1:36:20|1:36:26|[Wu Tian] let out a roar of incompetence, and [Gu Xiaomeng] closed her eyes as well.
1:36:27|1:36:37|A Communist Party member with a strong belief, in the face of confidential information and life, she resolutely chose to sacrifice the latter, to protect her team members, and to preserve the strength of the organization.
1:36:37|1:36:41|The devilish interrogation meeting in Qiu Zhuang comes to an end.
1:36:41|1:36:49|In the interrogation room, [Wu Tian] sat in the interrogation chair smoking a cigarette. The commander, wearing a military coat and leaning on a cane, walked slowly towards him.
1:36:49|1:36:58|Approaching [Wu Tian] before speaking.
1:36:59|1:37:7|The gloomy [Wu Tian] lowered his head and took a drag of his cigarette before speaking slowly.
1:37:7|1:37:16|He looked at the commander with a determined look.
1:37:17|1:37:27|Wang Tianxiang on the side listened thoughtfully. The commander spoke.
1:37:38|1:37:47|Wang Tianxiang on the side felt nervous when he heard this. He tentatively said.
1:37:48|1:37:54|[Wang Tianxiang] suspects that he might be the scapegoat.
1:38:0|1:38:6|Under the brim of the hat, the commander's fierce eyes stared at [Wang Tianxiang] as he walked out. Suddenly, the commander pulled out a gun.
1:38:6|1:38:16|[Wang Tianxiang] saw from the reflection in the mirror that he narrowly escaped danger. He then picked up a steel pipe and rushed forward to pin the commander against the wall.
1:38:26|1:38:36|[Wang Tianxiang] was shot dead, and the body slowly slid down against the commander. The one who fired the gun was [Wu Tian].
1:38:36|1:38:44|The commander leaning against the wall was still in shock, slowly walking out with the support of the wall corner. [Wu Tian] slowly lowered his raised gun arm.
1:38:44|1:38:46|The commander looked down at [Wang Tianxiang] on the ground.
1:38:57|1:39:6|On a snowy night, cars turned at the intersection and lined up in front of the [Baicaotang]. The snow was heavy and urgent.
1:39:7|1:39:15|The eaves and roof of the house are covered with white snow. A group of senior Japanese military officers walk towards the [Baicaotang] in a firm stride.
1:39:15|1:39:24|Inside the Bai Cao Tang, the Japanese soldiers stood in neat formation, their shiny steel guns ready for the Communist Party members. Outside Bai Cao Tang, on the car,
1:39:24|1:39:31|The commander sat in the back row staring at the door, while [Wu Tian] sat in the front row. Snowflakes fell outside the window.
1:39:31|1:39:41|Tonight is their last chance. The next morning, the car was covered with thick snow, and a vendor was pushing a cart through the deep snow.
1:39:46|1:39:53|Pedestrians began to appear on the street. The commander, who was sleeping in the car with his hat askew, suddenly opened his eyes.
1:39:53|1:39:58|He looked out of the windows on both sides, when the camel merchant passed by.
1:39:58|1:40:5|The commander turned to look at [Wu Tian] in the front seat, knowing that their only chance to salvage the plan had failed.
1:40:5|1:40:10|At this moment, the song from the street broadcast, and [Wu Tian] had already fallen asleep.
1:40:10|1:40:18|Time flies, it's already three months later. The road on the rain-soaked dock is muddy, and the reinforcements of the Japanese army march in line, carrying their rifles.
1:40:18|1:40:25|The thunder roared in the sky as the officer commanded the troops to advance.
1:40:25|1:40:37|A military truck drives through a muddy dock. It stops at a small warehouse and opens the railing.
1:40:38|1:40:41|Among the senior military officers getting off the car was also [Wu Tian].
1:40:42|1:40:53|The Japanese reinforcements on the side left, making room for the senior officers. The officers being sent back to Japan crowded forward to sign, while [Wu Tian], with iron chains around his wrists, moved around to the other side of the eaves.
1:40:53|1:40:59|He reached into his pocket and took out a pack of cigarettes, then went to sit under the eaves on a wooden box. In the crowd,
1:40:59|1:41:6|A figure with a military backpack on his back and wearing a raincoat walks in. His steps are very firm.
1:41:7|1:41:15|Passing by Wu Tian, he glanced at him intentionally, took a puff of his cigarette, and sat down next to Wu Tian. Wu Tian didn't mind at all.
1:41:15|1:41:20|Taking the cigarette he lit and lighting one for herself. After finishing, she returned the cigarette to the other person.
1:41:21|1:41:30|The two sat under the eaves, sheltering from the rain. [Wu Tian] enjoyed taking a few puffs of his cigarette and also opened up the conversation.
1:41:38|1:41:44|And the man just smoked by himself, never answering [Wu Tian].
1:41:45|1:41:48|Wu Tian continued to smoke, indifferent.
1:41:50|1:41:57|He exhaled smoke, glanced at the soldiers beside him, and sneered.
1:41:57|1:42:5|Wu Tian looked complexly at the rain and took a deep breath.
1:42:12|1:42:24|Speaking of this, Wu Tian couldn't help but smile. He lowered his head and took a puff of his cigarette, and the soldier next to him finished smoking as well. The sound of the steamboat's whistle could be heard.
1:42:24|1:42:32|The soldier patted [Wu Tian] on the shoulder. [Wu Tian] had just looked up when he was pressed down, and a small knife quickly slashed across his trachea.
1:42:33|1:42:40|[Wu Tian] looked up with wide eyes. This soldier was none other than the miraculously survived [Wu Zhiguo].
1:42:40|1:42:46|[Wu Zhiguo] covered the wound on his neck with his collar and walked into the rain wearing a hood.
1:42:46|1:42:55|Wu Tian's body uncontrollably knelt down slowly, then blood sprayed from his neck, and he fell backwards onto the muddy ground. On the rainy dock,
1:42:55|1:43:0|The ship that can take him home is parked not far away.
1:43:0|1:43:7|Shortly after, the Japanese army announced their surrender. The wide streets were filled with crowds of people celebrating this historic moment.
1:43:7|1:43:23|On the street, a Japanese military officer rides by in a car, and the people cheer and dance happily, twisting Yangko and performing lion dances to express their joy in their own way. In the new era toilet paper factory, banners with the words "Work hard to produce" and "Comfort the national army" are hung up.
1:43:23|1:43:34|The workshop director led [Wu Zhiguo], dressed in a sharp suit, to a production line. They arrived at the line and the director leaned in and shouted inside.
1:43:34|1:43:44|Director approached, [Li Ningyu] turned around and saw [Wu Zhiguo] stunned on the spot.
1:43:44|1:43:51|On the street, [Li Ningyu] and [Wu Zhiguo] walked, with [Li Ningyu] looking pale and despondent.
1:43:58|1:44:7|The two sat facing each other in a coffee shop, [Wu Zhiguo] picked up the cup and took a sip of coffee.
1:44:24|1:44:32|[Li Ningyu] also picked up the cup and took a sip, while [Wu Zhiguo] took out a cigarette and lit it for himself.
1:44:33|1:44:38|[Li Ningyu] felt somewhat inexplicable.
1:44:39|1:44:47|Li Ningyu still doesn't understand what's so attractive about women's cheongsams.
1:45:1|1:45:8|[Wu Zhiguo] took a puff of his cigarette. While [Li Ningyu] across from him furrowed her brows, trying hard to recall what happened that night.
1:45:18|1:45:22|After Wu Zhiguo's explanation, Li Ningyu looked thoughtfully at the coffee cup.
1:45:22|1:45:25|Qiu Zhuang's brief and painful days made her have to remember for eternity.
1:45:25|1:45:29|[Li Ningyu] supported her forehead and reminisced.
1:45:29|1:45:37|That night, [Wu Zhiguo] burst into [Gu Xiaomeng]'s room. [Wu Zhiguo] frowned and stared at [Gu Xiaomeng], then smiled slightly.
1:45:42|1:45:44|He reached out to touch the bugs around him.
1:45:44|1:45:48|At that time, [Wang Tianxiang] had just intercepted the signal in [Gu Xiaomeng]'s room.
1:45:49|1:45:56|[Gu Xiaomeng] pretended not to appreciate it, [Wu Zhiguo] pointed at his ear and pushed [Gu Xiaomeng] down.
1:45:58|1:46:5|[Wu Zhiguo] taped the bug under the table.
1:46:43|1:46:50|Outside came the sound of footsteps, indicating that time was running out for them. [Wu Zhiguo] tore open [Gu Xiaomeng]'s collar.
1:46:50|1:46:53|[Gu Xiaomeng] found that this comrade was more thoughtful in handling matters than she was.
1:46:53|1:47:2|[Wu Zhiguo] walked while messing up his own clothes. [Gu Xiaomeng] understood the meaning behind it, and went to the mirror to mess up her hair, pretending to be bullied by [Wu Zhiguo].
1:47:24|1:47:32|After [Li Ningyu] was taken away for questioning, the room was left with only [Gu Xiaomeng], [Wu Zhiguo], and two corpses. [Wu Zhiguo] walked quietly to [Gu Xiaomeng]'s side.
1:47:32|1:47:41|Grabbing [Gu Xiaomeng]'s hand, he wrote in her palm: "If no message comes out tonight, the organization will be destroyed, I will take the blame."
1:47:41|1:47:47|Finally, [Wu Zhiguo] reached into his pocket and pulled out a cigarette, the very one that had caught the eye of [Wang Tianxiang] behind him, the Three Cannon Tower.
1:47:47|1:47:56|He placed the cigarette in [Gu Xiaomeng]'s palm and helped her grip it. With red eyes, [Gu Xiaomeng] shook her head gently, tears swirling in her eyes.
1:47:56|1:48:5|Later, [Gu Xiaomeng] wrote on [Wu Zhiguo]'s hand: "You must stay alive and find a way to get the message out." [Wu Zhiguo] shook his head and wrote:
1:48:5|1:48:13|I am Lao Qiang, I order you to report me. [Gu Xiaomeng] pursed her lips, tears in her eyes, looking at this comrade who was both familiar and unfamiliar.
1:48:13|1:48:21|The two held each other's hands tightly, looking at each other with determined eyes. This was the organization's last hope, to either succeed or die trying.
1:48:22|1:48:32|[Gu Xiaomeng] looked at [Wu Zhiguo], pondered for a moment, and wrote in his palm: "You have to hold on, I have a way." [Wu Zhiguo] frowned into a Sichuan character.
1:48:32|1:48:36|[Gu Xiaomeng] adjusted her emotions, preventing tears from falling, and then calmly said.
1:48:36|1:48:40|[Wu Zhiguo] had to act with her.
1:48:54|1:49:0|In the café, [Wu Zhiguo] smoked a cigarette and poured out his inner thoughts at that time.
1:49:6|1:49:15|[Wu Zhiguo] took another drag on his cigarette as he recalled. At that time, the doctor moved him onto the operating table.
1:49:15|1:49:19|The length of the singing style hints at Morse code.
1:49:19|1:49:26|In the operating room, a nurse listened while tapping her fingers lightly, translating: "The intelligence is false, do not take action."
1:49:27|1:49:35|Understanding the meaning, the nurse quickly walked out of the operating room. And so, [Wu Zhiguo] sent out the intelligence in a life-threatening manner.
1:49:38|1:49:45|In the coffee shop, [Li Ningyu] asked again in confusion.
1:49:49|1:49:52|[Wu Zhiguo] pondered for a moment and remained silent.
1:49:52|1:49:56|He took a deep drag on his cigarette and began to recount [Gu Xiaomeng]'s plan at that time.
1:49:56|1:50:5|In the living room of Qiu Zhuang, [Gu Xiaomeng] is holding clothes and a needle, lost in thought.
1:50:11|1:50:20|The Chinese characters that appeared earlier in the network pattern turned out to be left by [Gu Xiaomeng]. The scene then shifts to the moment when [Gu Xiaomeng] is shot.
1:50:20|1:50:28|Through her coat, the blood-stained fabric inside revealed the Chinese characters: "The intelligence is false, do not take action, Old Ghost."
1:50:28|1:50:36|The scene cuts to [Gu Xiaomeng] covered in a white cloth being carried out of the house.
1:50:42|1:50:47|Back in the coffee shop, [Li Ningyu] was digesting the secrets within.
1:50:47|1:50:50|Before long, [Wu Zhiguo] arrived at her house with [Li Ningyu].
1:50:51|1:50:59|This is an old adobe house, far from the luxurious life of [Li Ningyu] back then. Now a worker, [Li Ningyu] takes out the key and unlocks the door.
1:50:59|1:51:6|In the room, [Li Ningyu] stepped on a chair to open the trunk on the wardrobe, searching for a while, and quickly found the cheongsam she wore at that time.
1:51:6|1:51:16|[Li Ningyu] handed the cheongsam to [Wu Zhiguo].
1:51:17|1:51:27|[Wu Zhiguo] found the seam of the cheongsam and held [Li Ningyu]'s hand on each button. [Li Ningyu] gently rubbed it, and immediately put the cheongsam into her arms.
1:51:27|1:51:35|She leaned in for a closer look, the intermittent and sparse stitches seemed to follow a certain pattern. [Li Ningyu] walked and looked, then slowly sat down.
1:51:35|1:51:42|The letter was made up of stitches of varying lengths. Beside it, [Wu Zhiguo] added.
1:51:46|1:51:52|[Li Ningyu] was already completely absorbed. The threads of the seam seemed to turn into words in the air like magic. "Whether the information is leaked or not, success or failure will be known in the coming days."
1:51:52|1:52:1|[Li Ningyu] understood every word left by this sister. The more she read, the more anxious she became, the more she wanted to know.
1:52:1|1:52:4|What does this sister, who always calls herself Yu Jie, have in mind?
1:52:4|1:52:8|The special letter reads: "I am not afraid of death."
1:52:8|1:52:14|What I fear is that those who love me will not know why I died. I am in purgatory, leaving behind this record.
1:52:14|1:52:22|I just hope my family and Sister Yu can forgive me for my decision at this moment. [Wu Zhiguo] looked at [Li Ningyu] with a heavy heart.
1:52:22|1:52:29|While [Li Ningyu] was flipping her cheongsam, tears were streaming down her face. She finally put down the cheongsam and gently clenched her fists.
1:52:29|1:52:37|After a long time without smoking, she tremblingly took out a cigarette and put it in her mouth, and [Wu Zhiguo] timely lit it for her.
1:52:37|1:52:45|Her lips trembled involuntarily. She held the cigarette in her hand and smoked it eagerly, like a drug addict who had finally found relief after a long drought.
1:52:45|1:52:51|And the addiction in his heart is the deep longing for his best friend and his sister.
1:52:51|1:52:56|Tears and snot flowed freely, but she was now both embarrassed and relieved.
1:52:56|1:53:3|This letter, this monologue now laid bare in front of oneself, is the heartfelt communication between the two sisters.
1:53:4|1:53:8|True sadness is when you can't cry out loud, only tears are streaming down.
1:53:8|1:53:15|Back in the car, [Wu Zhiguo] looked solemn, his brows furrowed into a character for "river". This man, a senior officer and seasoned veteran,
1:53:15|1:53:24|At the most critical moment, it was the strong and brave female comrade [Gu Xiaomeng], the leader of the organization, who stood up and protected him, protecting the organization with her life.
1:53:24|1:53:33|The once tortured Wu Zhiguo, who never revealed a word, shed tears at this moment.
