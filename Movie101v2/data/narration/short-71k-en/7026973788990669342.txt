0:2:19|0:2:44|The Ghost King Party of 6 people drank the rhombus wine together. The leader [Han Jiang] on the opposite side also finished the wine in his cup in one gulp. In the blink of an eye, all 6 people put on masks and stood side by side. A mask also appeared on [Han Jiang]'s face, with the difference that there was a statue of Guanyin above his mask. [Wang Weiyi] was wearing a police uniform, staring straight ahead with a furrowed brow, vacant eyes, and a straight line for a mouth.
0:3:10|0:3:23|[Wang Weiyi] sat straight in the police post at the entrance of the emergency room, with an empty hall in front of him. A bold ink character suddenly jumped out from a thick white fog, "Demon", and smoke exploded with a pile of dollars scattered on the ground.
0:3:23|0:3:47|Han Jiang, wearing a mask, threw a bomb at the police. Pedestrians on the street ducked and covered their heads. Officer Mo stood up and saw that the police officer next to him had lost an arm and a leg in the explosion. The Ghost King Party shouted as the masked man in a gray suit ran forward but was shot and fell to the ground. Officer Mo dragged the injured officer with a severed leg back, while the shot Ghost King Party member crawled forward and reached the back of the car.
0:3:47|0:4:14|[Jingji Wen] attacked [Officer Mo] and shot at the back of the car. The police shouted at the crowd crouching on the side of the road. [Jingji Wen] half-squatted and walked to the side of the car, sitting in the driver's seat on the right. [Officer Mo] shot at the windshield, and [Han Jiang] immediately shot and injured [Officer Mo]'s left arm. The car drove up next to [Han Jiang], and Guai Wang Dang took a look. [Han Jiang] lowered his head to look at the diamond. In the back seat, [Zhi Zha'en] quickly closed the money box and shut the car door.
0:4:15|0:4:38|[Han Jiang] fired two shots at the ghost king who was questioning, [Hall Steward] got out of the passenger seat and shot at the car where Officer Mo and others were hiding. The ghost king who was questioning was avenged by [Han Jiang] with a shot, but he also got shot and blood splattered. [Han Jiang] drove closer to the car while bending down and hiding in the back seat of the car. The car reversed and left the scene, with two bold characters jumping out of the thick black smoke, revealing the movie title "Magic Police".
0:4:40|0:5:0|[Han Jiang] opened the wooden door with a key, casually closed the security door outside, and the wooden door was also shut, plunging the room back into darkness. A yellow light came on, [Han Jiang] walked up the steps, took out a intricately patterned box from the cabinet, gently blew away the dust on the surface of the box, closed the iron cabinet, and the room was filled with densely packed wires.
0:5:2|0:5:18|Under the dim streetlights, Officer Mo sat in the car, staring intently at the floor where Han Jiang was located. A black Volkswagen drove up the slope and parked by the roadside, its headlights turned off. Chen Zhibin looked around and got out of the car, then approached Officer Mo's car and leaned against the window.
0:5:54|0:6:0|With everyone wearing bulletproof vests, Officer Mo deployed the operation.
0:6:6|0:6:26|Officer Mo followed closely behind, walking towards the building behind Hua Han Tea Restaurant. Han Jiang lit a cigarette in his mouth, threw the lighter aside, and wearing gloves, he picked up a bullet from a full box, examined it carefully, then put it back. He took the cigarette out of his mouth, and at that moment, a text message with the ending number 6271 came in, signaling that the police were arriving.
0:6:29|0:6:55|[Officer Mo] is holding a chainsaw to cut the lock of the security door. [Han Jiang] immediately puts the bullets into his bag, and sparks fly as the chainsaw cuts. [Han Jiang] places the lighter on the electric heater inside the door, then escapes with his bag. He climbs along the scaffolding outside the building, but the lighter is being heated by the heater. [Chen Zhibin] quietly watches from outside the door. The lock of the security door is cut off by the chainsaw, and the officers smash open the door with a sledgehammer.
0:6:56|0:7:20|The moment the door opened, the lighter on the fireplace exploded, and Officer Mo rushed into the room with a gun. [Han Jiang] was climbing on the wall towards the outside, while Officer Mo and others sneaked into the room. [Han Jiang] climbed up to the rooftop holding onto the scaffolding, and the officers immediately noticed. On the top floor, [Han Jiang] took off his backpack, quietly covered the rooftop access with a lid, and slipped into the corridor through the other side ladder.
0:7:20|0:7:29|[Han Jiang] runs in the chaotic corridor, quickly turns around, and swiftly rushes into the hallway. He leaps and jumps down 6 steps.
0:7:29|0:7:53|Downstairs, two police officers happened to look up as they rushed towards him. [Han Jiang] hid in a doorway around the corner. The officers approached quietly, but as soon as they pushed the door, [Han Jiang] stabbed with a knife, stabbing the officers behind the door five times. He coldly looked at the fallen officers, dropped the knife, and ran down the stairs. Officer Mo and others chased him to the rooftop, but [Han Jiang] had already walked quickly onto the street.
0:7:53|0:8:20|He turned into an alley filled with abandoned steel, walked to a motorcycle, put on the helmet on the bike, started the engine after stepping on it, the headlights suddenly lit up, the motorcycle made a big turn, drove into a commercial street, suddenly a car rushed out and rear-ended the motorcycle, [Han Jiang] hit a taxi in front, his whole body flew out and smashed into the debris inside the repair shop door.
0:8:21|0:8:27|He climbed up with an oil drum in his hand, blood streaming down his forehead, and in a daze, he searched the ground for something.
0:8:27|0:8:49|[Han Jiang] picked up the helmet from the ground and carried it in his hand, walking towards the street as if nothing had happened. His pace gradually slowed down, leaning against a car on the roadside, he looked at his body. The helmet in [Han Jiang]'s hand suddenly fell, and there was a steel bar inserted in his waist. [Han Jiang] steadied himself against the car, stood up unsteadily, and walked to the middle of the road.
0:8:49|0:9:14|He reached out and stopped a passing taxi, leaning against the car and getting in. The driver was startled by the man with steel bars inserted in his body in front of him, and turned back a few times. When he got off the car, [Han Jiang]'s trousers and leather shoes were already covered in blood. He carried his clothes, leaving a bloodstain with each step towards the hospital gate. The glass door opened automatically, and the blood-covered [Han Jiang] immediately caught the attention of everyone in the hall.
0:9:45|0:9:57|The nurse took a bottle of medicine from the refrigerator and placed it on a tray, then walked out of the blood transfusion department. [Han Jiang] and [Wang Weiyi] were lying on two beds, with doctors and nurses surrounding [Han Jiang] to provide emergency treatment.
0:9:57|0:10:14|[Wang Weiyi] clenched his fist as blood flowed through the IV tube into the blood bag. He lay calmly, turning his head to look through the gap at [Han Jiang]'s hospital bed. [Han Jiang] seemed to sense the gaze and slowly opened his eyes to look back at him.
0:10:14|0:10:35|[Wang Weiyi] saw [Han Jiang]'s face and furrowed his brows. Suddenly, the image of a riot police officer flashed in his mind, the resemblance between the two faces was striking. While [Han Jiang] calmly turned his head, [Wang Weiyi] looked terrified. Three black Volkswagens with flashing police lights sped towards them and stopped in the open space in front of the hospital building.
0:10:35|0:10:38|As soon as the car stopped, the plainclothes officers quickly got out of the car.
0:11:13|0:11:43|[Chen Zhibin] stood aside watching [Officer Mo] explode in anger, while [Wang Weiyi] stood helplessly in place, watching [Officer Mo] and the others leave. His pupils trembled, like a child who had done something wrong. Inside [Wang Weiyi's Father]'s house, the room was dim and quiet, the clock on the bedside table ticking smoothly, pointing to exactly 10 o'clock. [Wang Weiyi] lay on the bed, sweating profusely, and slowly looked towards his waist.
0:11:44|0:11:53|His arm where blood was drawn was gushing blood, soaking through his sleeve and bedding. In panic, he tried to get out of bed but slipped on the blood pooling by the bedside.
0:11:53|0:11:59|[Wang Weiyi] woke up from a dream, with [Wang Weiyi's Father] sitting in front of him, eating and talking.
0:12:1|0:12:10|The hallucination fleeting, [Wang Weiyi] sat up in bed and turned on the bedside lamp. He lowered his head, tiredly covering his face, and rubbed his eyes with the back of his hand.
0:12:12|0:12:27|At the desk, [Wang Weiyi] dipped his brush in ink under the lamp to paint. Different colored abstract paintings hung above the desk, and [Wang Weiyi] used a flat brush to apply a black block on the painting, covering the entire tabletop. The painting consisted of varying shades of gray blocks.
0:12:40|0:13:9|[Wang Weiyi] held the brush in his hand, frozen in mid-air, his brows furrowed as he stared at the black paint that had spilled beyond the grid. The hallucination of [Wang Weiyi's Father] appeared once again, the black paint outside the grid seemed to become a shadow in [Wang Weiyi]'s mind. He tossed the brush into a glass jar filled with water, the ink spreading in the water, the ink blot gradually expanding, the entire bottle of water plunged into darkness. Inside a dilapidated residential building,
0:13:9|0:13:31|[Wang Weiyi]'s face floated past the window of the corridor. He carried a bag on his back and a white plastic bag in his left hand as he walked to the door of Room 402. He took out the key, unlocked the anti-theft door, and carefully cut his grandmother's hair. Her brows furrowed slightly, her eyes focused intently. With half-closed eyes, she enjoyed [Wang Weiyi]'s service while eating. [Wang Weiyi] handed the money to the maid.
0:13:58|0:14:6|In the quiet afternoon, a half-sealed strip still lingers on the iron gate of the corridor.
0:14:16|0:14:47|[Wang Weiyi] smiled and looked at his grandmother, picked up a piece of salted egg and handed it to her to put in her bowl. She took a small bite and looked at [Wang Weiyi] with a satisfied smile. On the table were two simple dishes. The grandmother and grandson ate quietly, sharing a smile. The scene was plain and warm, bringing back memories. In his childhood, [Wang Weiyi] and his grandmother pushed a small cart together.
0:14:47|0:14:51|The stacked cardboard boxes in the car are almost as tall as [Wang Weiyi].
0:14:51|0:15:6|At night, [Wang Weiyi] turned off the bedside lamp of his grandmother, picked up the backpack on the sofa and put it on his back. He opened the back door but hesitated at the front door, quietly watching his grandmother in bed. After a while, he finally closed the door gently.
0:15:7|0:15:32|[Wang Weiyi] came to a corridor, passed a T-shaped corner, and remembered his childhood when he ran past here with a pile of things. Looking at the dim light in the corridor, [Wang Weiyi] lowered his head, closed his eyes tightly, then opened them again to look at the corner. His expression became natural, but he quickly turned and left, the graveyard at night was particularly cold.
0:15:32|0:15:44|On the road below the slope, a BMW roared past, crushing the arm of an Indonesian man. [Jingji Wen] chuckled as he removed the cloth from his mouth.
0:16:23|0:16:31|[Jingji Wen] arranged for his men to burn the Indonesian man inside the police station building, where people were running around in chaos.
0:17:58|0:18:3|[Wang Weiyi] nodded slightly and got up to leave. [Officer Mo] stopped the nurse pushing [Han Jiang]'s hospital bed.
0:18:13|0:18:21|Officer Mo pointed at Han Jiang's head.
0:19:52|0:19:56|[Wang Weiyi] continued to inspect the vehicles on the road, while the owner of the repair shop asked [Guang Zi].
0:20:8|0:20:14|[Wang Weiyi] and [Guang Zi] arrived at the new floor and saw an old lady wiping off the paint on the wall.
0:20:32|0:20:55|The old building, much lower than the adjacent high-rise, had walls that were also in a dilapidated state. [Wang Weiyi] searched left and right at the bottom of the building for [Guang Zi]'s figure. He stopped at an alley entrance, where [Guang Zi] and two officers were smoking. The officers, upon noticing him, looked displeased. After exchanging farewells, they dispersed. [Guang Zi] took a few deep drags of his cigarette before tossing it away and running towards [Wang Weiyi].
0:20:56|0:21:6|[Wang Weiyi] pushed open the door to the courtyard, [Guang Zi] persuaded, but [Wang Weiyi] still went in.
0:21:16|0:21:28|Guang Zi stayed at the door, while Wang Weiyi walked into the dirty and messy corridor with a flashlight in hand. Towels hung on the walls in the corners, and on the iron rack were toilet paper and snack bags. The beam of light shone on a pair of feet wearing sneakers.
0:21:28|0:21:36|[Wang Weiyi] squatted down and saw candles and syringes on the table. The long-haired man leaning in the corner had severely ulcerated hands.
0:21:37|0:21:44|[Wang Weiyi] gathers around the male corpse, a burnt body suddenly flashes in his mind. He lowers his head, rubs his eyes, steadies his mind, and shouts,
0:21:50|0:21:57|In the public restroom, [Wang Weiyi] sniffed his hands, then frantically pressed the hand sanitizer and washed his hands in front of the faucet.
0:21:57|0:22:6|Foam and water rushed into the pipeline from the drain. [Wang Weiyi] sniffed again, looking anxiously at his hands in the mirror as they suddenly burst into flames while he was washing them.
0:22:6|0:22:12|He panicked and slapped at the flames on his hands, but the reflection in the mirror showed his hands were unharmed.
0:22:12|0:22:19|In the empty restroom, only he stood by the sink, slapping his hands randomly. Finally, the fire he saw disappeared.
0:22:19|0:22:31|[Wang Weiyi] looked at the mirror in shock, suddenly took off his police cap, splashed water on his face, vigorously rubbed his face a few times, and leaned on the sink with both arms, breathing heavily, in the hospital.
0:22:40|0:22:44|[Han Jiang] opened his eyes and looked at the ceiling. Two police officers pushed the door open and stood outside the ward.
0:22:47|0:23:9|[Han Jiang] picked up his clothes and covered his chest, then took the towel from the nearby bed. Through the glass on the door of the ward, Officer Mo saw [Han Jiang] walking into the patient's bathroom with the towel. As soon as he entered, [Han Jiang] propped up the mop against the door handle, wet the towel to cover his mouth and nose. He poured detergent into the bucket, splashed all the water on the floor.
0:23:9|0:23:24|He then found bleach and laundry detergent, poured a bucket of bleach into the water bucket, unscrewed the cap of the detergent, poured all the powder into the water, and white smoke immediately rose from the bucket, alerting the nurse.
0:23:41|0:23:54|[Han Jiang] threw away the mop, causing the two police officers who were knocking on the door to slip and fall to the ground immediately. The officers were choked by the smoke in the bathroom, coughing continuously and unable to get up. Without looking back, [Han Jiang] dropped the towel and walked out of the ward, heading to the police car.
0:24:12|0:24:22|[Wang Weiyi] heard the news with a serious expression. In the swimming pool, [Wang Weiyi] leaped into the water, his back covered with scars. [Wang Weiyi] held his breath underwater.
0:24:28|0:24:50|The words of [Guang Zi] and [Officer Mo] kept echoing in his ears. As night fell, under the vast overpass, the dim street lights shone, reflecting on the bridge tunnel. The bluestone bricks were illuminated in a mottled pattern. Under the bridge tunnel, [Han Jiang] came alone to a dark figure, raising his hands as a greeting.
0:25:10|0:25:25|[Han Jiang] pursed his lips and thought for a moment before saying, outside the Jiulong Funeral Parlor, [Zhi Zha'en] walked by carrying four paper figures.
0:25:35|0:26:3|Inside the funeral parlor, a funeral is taking place. A blue banner with white words hangs in the hall, saying "Pure Land of the Departed." [Zhi Zha'en] places four paper figures on each side of the altar, while the [Hall Steward] in a white coat walks into the hall. [Hua Zai Xiang] tries to move the flower baskets given by the deceased's relatives to the sides of the altar. Only a few dim lights are left in the hall, and the crowd sits quietly watching as the Buddhist scriptures are chanted and the merit master performs the ritual. [Nan Muqing] spins a torch rapidly.
0:26:3|0:26:10|Lifting his leg and striking a pose to end the funeral, in the dead of night, Wang Weiyi encounters [Han Jiang], the leader of the Ghost King Party.
0:28:11|0:28:38|[Wang Weiyi] sat in the car, looking ahead anxiously. The police got off the car and engaged in a gunfight with the Ghost King Gang on the overpass. Several police officers lay on the roadside, shot and fallen. The masked [Hall Steward] carried a box and shot with a gun. [Hua Zai Xiang] ran to a taxi, [Han Jiang] fired with a submachine gun, [Hall Steward] threw the box into the trunk of the car.
0:28:45|0:29:14|[Jingji Wen] discovered the police car approaching from behind and immediately started shooting at it. Bullets pierced through the windshield and hit the police officer sitting in the front passenger seat of the taxi. The taxi drove onto the opposite lane, and [Guang Zi] and [Wang Weiyi] got out of the car with guns. [Wang Weiyi] took the lead and ran ahead. The overpass was filled with cars, and the gaps were filled with the bodies of pedestrians. [Han Jiang], [Zhi Zha'en], and [Nan Muqing] fought with the police on the road.
0:29:14|0:29:21|Nan Muqing shoots and kills the police officer in front, and [Wang Weiyi] happens to arrive and hides behind a car. Seeing Nan Muqing aiming to escape with a gun, Wang Weiyi takes aim at him.
0:29:21|0:29:39|After a burst of random gunfire, Nan Muqing was shot in the abdomen. Han Jiang twisted his body and rushed to Zhi Zha'en, holding a gun to counterattack the police reinforcements. Wang Weiyi quickly loaded the pistol and locked eyes with Clever Boy across the way. The two stood up and approached Han Jiang and the others. Han Jiang put down his submachine gun and drew the pistol from behind to respond.
0:29:41|0:29:44|[Wang Weiyi] and [Clever Boy] are pointing their guns at the Ghost King Party.
0:29:46|0:30:10|Nan Muqing's abdomen was soaked with blood, [Han Jiang] calmly looked at [Zhi Zha'en], who was panting in panic. The police and the Ghost King Party were only separated by 4 cars, but they were in a tense standoff in absolute silence. When [Han Jiang] heard the sound of water, he slightly peeked out from the back of the car. The Mazda in front of Clever Boy was continuously leaking oil, forming a puddle underneath the car.
0:30:10|0:30:34|Gasoline flowed over the single dashed line on the road, spreading to the other side. [Han Jiang] seized the opportunity, bent down and aimed at the leaking car, firing two shots in a row. The leaking car instantly exploded, with the glass of the rear door and trunk shattering into pieces. [Clever Boy] was pushed into the air by the powerful airflow, as the fire snakes slowly spread up from his pants cuffs.
0:30:35|0:30:45|Wang Weiyi in the rear was affected by the airflow, flew out with a gun, and the Mazda was engulfed by towering flames, with Clever Boy's whole body also engulfed in flames.
0:30:46|0:30:54|[Wang Weiyi] fell heavily onto the windshield of the car behind, the exploding Mazda enveloped in a huge cloud of white smoke,
0:30:56|0:31:24|[Clever Boy] was tightly surrounded by the fireball, frantically waving his arms to beat out the flames on his body. [Wang Weiyi] lay on the ground, half-mouthed and wide-eyed, watching [Clever Boy] howling in the fire. Memories flooded back, a man similarly engulfed in flames knelt in a small room. [Han Jiang] walked up to [Wang Weiyi] with a gun, and as if seeing behind the mask, [Wang Weiyi] saw [Han Jiang]'s face. [Han Jiang] pointed the gun at him, but slowly moved out of his sight.
0:31:24|0:31:44|[Wang Weiyi] sat across from [Clever Boy], watching as his body slowly turned into charcoal. A black car drove into the cemetery in the mountains, with [Zhi Zha'en] at the wheel glancing at the rearview mirror to see the severely injured [Nan Muqing] and [Han Jiang] in the back seat.
0:31:53|0:32:13|The black car is driving on a small road, at the end of the road is an open space on a small hill. [Jingji Wen], [Hall Steward], and [Hua Zai Xiang] are standing in a triangle formation. Inside the car, [Han Jiang] suddenly pulls out a gun and points it at [Zhi Zha'en]. [Han Jiang] stares at the three people on the small hill, while [Jingji Wen] stands with his hands in his pockets looking towards the car.
0:32:22|0:32:41|Three men gradually approached the black car. [Han Jiang] looked at the three men calmly and said, [Zhi Zha'en] immediately reversed the car. [Jingji Wen] was shocked, [Hall Steward] and [Hua Zai Xiang] quickly caught up. Suddenly, there was a sharp brake, [Zhi Zha'en] rolled out of the car, and [Han Jiang] fired several shots at the three men in front of the car.
0:32:41|0:32:49|[Han Jiang] shouted at [Nan Muqing], who struggled to open the car door. [Hall Steward] asked,
0:32:59|0:33:23|Three people were shooting wildly, [Nan Muqing] was shot like a sieve. [Han Jiang], who was hiding in the back seat, immediately counterattacked after the gunfire stopped. Running out of bullets, he decisively threw down the gun and escaped with a briefcase containing diamonds from the bushes by the roadside. [Hall Steward] was the first to rush into the woods with a gun, followed closely by the remaining 4 members of the Ghost King Party. [Han Jiang] was nowhere to be seen, so the 4 people stopped. [Jingji Wen] commanded,
0:33:24|0:33:48|Four of them split into two groups, with [Hall Steward] and [Hua Zai Xiang] heading right, while [Jingji Wen] and [Zhi Zha'en] searched to the left. They cautiously held their guns in the forest, searching around. [Hua Zai Xiang] pushed aside the leaves of a short tree in front of him. Not far ahead, [Han Jiang] hid behind a tree, holding a branch quietly waiting. Suddenly, [Han Jiang] appeared and struck [Hua Zai Xiang] in the abdomen.
0:33:48|0:34:4|[Han Jiang] clamped down on him with one hand and fired fiercely at the remaining few people with the other hand. Then [Han Jiang] jumped down the main slope, carrying a box and running in the woods. He was already exhausted, almost dragging the box forward. The Ghost King Party chased closely behind, following him to the edge of the cliff.
0:34:11|0:34:28|Several people quickly collected the guns, opened the briefcase left by [Han Jiang] at the edge of the cliff, pulled up a police cordon on the grass, and the police were taking photos of a car that had been burned to a frame. An officer said to [Officer Mo],
0:34:30|0:34:44|The officer handed the evidence bag to [Officer Mo], who squatted down in front of the burnt car. There was a charred skull on the back seat. [Officer Mo] stood up and said to the officer beside him,
0:34:55|0:35:5|[Chen Zhibin] took the initiative to keep an eye on the buyer. When they heard the report, several people came to the front of the car. [Officer Mo] brought a flashlight to illuminate under the driver's seat, where an oil drum had spilled in the ashes.
0:35:12|0:35:41|Under the night sky, the tall buildings sparkled with lights. The pedestrian bridge below was illuminated by dim street lamps, and the sound of chanting echoed across the bridge. A male sorcerer in Daoist robes was standing on the bridge, striking a bronze tower and reciting scriptures. Behind him stood several rows of mournful family members of the deceased, with [Wang Weiyi] standing expressionless at the far end of the first row. While others around him were mourning with folded hands, he remained indifferent. The crowd followed the ritual master in scattering paper money into the air.
0:35:42|0:35:50|Standing in the line, the female inspector's tears flowed down to her neck. She turned her head to look at [Wang Weiyi], but he had already left the line alone.
0:35:52|0:36:10|The subway passes through a densely populated area with high-rise buildings. A tall residential building is covered with crisscrossing scaffolding. [Wang Weiyi] lies on the bed, sweating profusely, with a band-aid on his forehead. He turns over and lies on his side, with the image of [Clever Boy] being blown up and engulfed in flames flashing through his mind.
0:36:10|0:36:24|Suddenly a child appears in the scene, lighting a room on fire with matches. The image of [Wang Weiyi] and [Han Jiang] holding a gun, staring at each other, also flashes through his mind. The female inspector calls [Wang Weiyi].
0:36:35|0:36:40|[Wang Weiyi] sat on the sofa as if his soul had been sucked out, then he received a call from the nanny.
0:36:57|0:37:4|The nanny saw [Wang Weiyi] clenching his fists and quickly said, "The doctor checked Grandma and said she didn't hurt her bones." [Wang Weiyi] tightly held the hand of his grandmother outside the blanket.
0:37:5|0:37:13|Grandma lay on the bed on her side, with a white cloth wrapped around her forehead, and a bruise at the corner of her mouth from a fall. [Wang Weiyi] gazed at her for a long time.
0:37:13|0:37:45|Grandma was still breathing unevenly in her sleep, [Wang Weiyi] turned to look in the direction of her face, where a table with a spirit tablet was placed. The tablet read "Beloved Son, Leung Wing Hung". Painful screams flashed through [Wang Weiyi]'s mind, furrowing his brows tightly and covering his ears with his hands. The screams faded away, and he trembled as he released his hands from his ears. Lowering his head, [Wang Weiyi] walked out of the door and heard voices coming from the corridor diagonally across.
0:37:48|0:38:16|[Wang Weiyi] stared at the man walking over, who was carrying a bucket and splashing paint on the wall. A bloody scene flashed in [Wang Weiyi]'s eyes. The man splashing paint saw him and stood up. [Wang Weiyi] viciously rushed towards him, grabbed the man's head and slammed it against the iron gate. Suddenly, a companion with a stick came from behind. [Wang Weiyi] instantly subdued the man's companion and punched him in the face.
0:38:16|0:38:28|The accomplice slumped down the wall, and [Wang Weiyi] turned back to fiercely kick the man who splashed paint. The man curled up on the ground, powerless to fight back, only able to make painful whimpering sounds.
0:38:28|0:38:50|[Wang Weiyi] gasped and stopped beating, leaning against the iron railing of the corridor. He looked at the two people lying on the ground with eyes wide open as if waking from a dream. [Wang Weiyi] shook his head in disbelief, the scene in front of him almost made him lose his balance. He looked around in confusion, his face full of fear and panic. A strange choking sound came from [Wang Weiyi]'s throat.
0:38:50|0:39:0|He regretfully covered his face with his hands, while [Wang Weiyi] used a belt to whip his own back, crying out in pain.
0:39:0|0:39:16|[Wang Weiyi] was bare-chested, repeatedly whipping himself. Scars from the beatings over the years covered his back. Unable to bear the pain, he knelt on the floor in the dimly lit room, with only a ray of light coming in through the window.
0:39:17|0:39:22|[Wang Weiyi] knelt on that patch of light, panting heavily, gradually calming his mind and regulating his breathing.
0:39:23|0:39:37|The scene rises to the darkness of the rooftop, dark clouds swirling around the silhouette of [Wang Weiyi]. He is wearing a uniform, but his eyes are dull and lifeless as he walks the streets like a zombie.
0:40:45|0:40:52|[Wang Weiyi]'s anger was instantly ignited, he pointed at the confused citizens and roared in anger, while on the police car, [Wang Weiyi] sat quietly.
0:41:1|0:41:14|The police officer fired a shot, and several citizens in front slowly fell to the ground. [Wang Weiyi] sat in the police car, bowing his head and tightly pursing his lips, while the person in white police uniform surprisingly had [Han Jiang]'s face.
0:41:14|0:41:34|He turned back and smiled triumphantly, [Wang Weiyi] suddenly jumped off the car and looked around vigilantly before shouting to his colleague and then sprinting towards another street. [Wang Weiyi] stood at the crowded intersection, looking around in all directions.
0:41:43|0:42:15|[Wang Weiyi] listened attentively, still looking around warily. His colleague glanced at the street, then at the absent-minded [Wang Weiyi]. [Wang Weiyi] sat in front of the inspector in silence, gazing solemnly at him. A psychiatrist arrived at [Wang Weiyi]'s home.
0:42:27|0:42:36|[Wang Weiyi] sat in the chair and nodded slightly.
0:43:36|0:43:53|[Wang Weiyi] slowly opens his eyes in his imagination, ashes floating around. He lies in bed and looks to the side, where a huge left eye appears by his bedside.
0:44:54|0:45:8|Childhood memories come flooding back, young [Wang Weiyi] bullies a classmate with a stick, and [Wang Weiyi] in police uniform fires two shots at a man with a backpack.
0:45:14|0:45:24|[Wang Weiyi] lay on the bed mechanically making whipping motions, young [Wang Weiyi] held up his school bag, [Wang Weiyi's Father] whipped [Wang Weiyi]'s buttocks with a belt.
0:45:46|0:45:54|The inspector looked at the doctor, who then reminded Wang Weiyi with a slight nod.
0:46:2|0:46:8|Wang Weiyi in police uniform salutes under the flag,
0:46:30|0:46:43|[Wang Weiyi]'s expression gradually became painful, imagining his grandmother sitting alone in a room engulfed in flames, a zombie flashing by, [Wang Weiyi]'s lips trembling as if crying.
0:46:58|0:47:10|A man with a stooped body in the raging fire, the [doctor] looked at [Wang Weiyi] in great pain, then turned to the inspector, who shook his head.
0:47:41|0:47:51|[Wang Weiyi] looked up at the psychiatrist and said.
0:48:23|0:48:48|Inspector hurried to Wang Weiyi's bedside after sending off the doctor. Before Wang Weiyi could respond, his phone suddenly rang. The inspector walked behind him, unplugged the phone charger, and handed the phone to Wang Weiyi. Wang Weiyi lay on the bed and answered the phone. After listening for a moment, he suddenly sat up.
0:49:50|0:50:11|The inspector was stunned when he saw the photo of a woman who looked like [Han Jiang], under the full moon, with clouds swiftly moving in front of the moon. [Wang Weiyi] was lying on the bed, sweating profusely, he slowly opened his eyes, but they seemed bottomless.
0:50:30|0:50:59|[Wang Weiyi] avoided his father's gaze, but the father across from him disappeared. [Wang Weiyi] sat alone at the table, nodding slightly as if agreeing with his father. He sat in front of the computer, typing "Ghost King" in the search bar. He stared at the screen as the page transitioned from Ghost King Master's Wikipedia page to various pages of mask images. [Wang Weiyi] kept switching between colorful and diverse images of Ghost Kings with different expressions. Suddenly, [Han Jiang] wearing a Ghost King mask appeared before him.
0:51:1|0:51:10|[Wang Weiyi] picked up a brush and drew various ghostly faces on the white paper. He was completely focused on his drawing and had already drawn over a dozen without realizing it.
0:51:10|0:51:18|Paper with various mask patterns hung in the air above the table. In the cemetery, Officer Mo sat in front of a tombstone drinking.
0:51:19|0:51:37|After taking a sip, he wiped the steps of the tombstone with a cloth. A black Volkswagen drove into the cemetery, and after the car stopped, an undercover police officer got out of the car. He ran towards Officer Mo with a folder in his hand.
0:51:37|0:51:43|[Officer Mo] lowered his head and opened a folder, while the officer looked at the tombstone next to him.
0:51:46|0:51:53|Officer Mo flipped open a page, on which there was a photo of Zhi Zha'en. Officer Mo said to the officers,
0:52:33|0:52:43|On the street, [Wang Weiyi] walks into a paper shop called Jun Cheng Xing, holding a piece of drawing paper and asking.
0:52:57|0:53:0|[Wang Weiyi] put away the drawing paper and walked out of the shop door, continuing to walk forward.
0:53:0|0:53:19|He came to a street lined with decorative paintings, turned into a shop, nodded at the grandfather [Wang Weiyi] watching the shop, and then took out his identification from his pocket after closing the paper.
0:54:6|0:54:15|[Zhi Zha'en] sat on a stool, ready to start working. Two police officers walked into Tianbao Building, and [Wang Weiyi] happened to come to the store. Suddenly, [Zhi Zha'en]'s phone rang, showing a caller ID of Big Head.
0:54:30|0:54:38|[Zhi Zha'en] stood up and took a few steps back towards the police, stuffing something into his hand. The police watched him vigilantly, keeping an eye on his every move.
0:54:50|0:54:52|[Wang Weiyi] followed [Zhi Zha'en] as soon as he saw him running out.
0:54:52|0:55:0|[Zhi Zha'en] threw away the tassel in his hand and ran into a narrow alley. He scrambled up a flight of stairs, stood at a high point, and confirmed that there was no one following him around.
0:55:2|0:55:23|[Wang Weiyi] hid behind a big tree and secretly watched him. He saw him walking down from the slope, then quickly descending another row of stone steps. [Zhi Zha'en] walked on the gentle steps next to the residential building, unaware that [Wang Weiyi] was following him from afar. [Zhi Zha'en] grabbed the handrail in the corridor, rapidly climbing the stairs. After running up several floors, he entered a floor illuminated by lights.
0:55:23|0:55:51|[Wang Weiyi] leaned out half of his body from the stairwell to look down the corridor. [Zhi Zha'en] walked to the end of that floor and turned into the stairwell. Finally, [Zhi Zha'en] stopped in front of a door, used a key to open it and entered the room. [Wang Weiyi] gradually approached the floor where [Zhi Zha'en] was, [Zhi Zha'en] rushed out of the corridor with a backpack. When he saw [Wang Weiyi] going upstairs, he immediately slowed down, but accidentally fell down.
0:55:54|0:56:12|[Wang Weiyi] looked down from the handrail gap and saw [Zhi Zha'en] collecting scattered diamonds into a bag. He hurriedly picked up the diamonds and stuffed them into the bag, then quickly ran into a parking lot with a backpack on his back. [Wang Weiyi] followed him into the parking lot, where [Zhi Zha'en] used a knife to cut open the edge of a spare tire.
0:56:12|0:56:28|[Wang Weiyi] stood behind a stone pillar in the parking lot, staring at him. [Zhi Zha'en] swiftly stuffed the bag containing diamonds into the spare tire, then placed the spare tire in the bottom of the car's trunk. After closing the trunk, he hurriedly left.
0:56:46|0:56:54|[Zhi Zha'en] faced everyone's suspicious gaze and timidly said.
0:57:6|0:57:12|[Hall Steward] raised his arms, [Zhi Zha'en] sighed helplessly.
0:57:29|0:57:41|[Jingji Wen], [Hall Steward], and [Hua Zai Xiang] walked out of the funeral parlor. [Wang Weiyi] sat in the car, watching them closely. [Jingji Wen] got into the black car in front, while the other three got into the white car behind.
0:57:41|0:57:49|A black car passed by [Wang Weiyi]'s car, while a white Mazda with license plate LK4969 drove in the opposite direction.
0:57:49|0:58:5|[Wang Weiyi] closed the car window and followed the white car onto the highway. The white car got off the highway and stopped by a T-junction. The back door of the car opened, and [Zhi Zha'en] got off with a bag on his back, walking away without looking back. Seeing him leave, [Hua Zai Xiang] immediately reported to the [Hall Steward].
0:58:18|0:58:31|[Hua Zai Xiang] got off the car and ran towards the shops on the roadside, while [Wang Weiyi] was still in the car closely watching the movements of the Ghost King Party. [Hua Zai Xiang] walked into the convenience store, and a bus with "Hong Kong Fuguanghui" written on it stopped in front of the store.
0:58:34|0:59:3|[Hua Zai Xiang] carried a plastic bag and a pornographic magazine as he walked out of the store. Suddenly, he saw a blind girl picking oranges by the roadside and was immediately attracted to her. He bent down to look at the blind girl's chest, then quickly ran back to his car. [Hua Zai Xiang] wanted to throw the plastic bag on the passenger seat, took out an electric baton, and as the blind girl walked up the dimly lit stairs with a stick, [Hua Zai Xiang] approached and knocked her down with the electric baton.
0:59:3|0:59:10|He dragged the blind sister down the stairs, all the way to the car, and stuffed her into the back seat.
0:59:11|0:59:17|[Wang Weiyi] witnessed everything in the car, his brows furrowed, eyes wide with anger, and immediately drove to catch up.
0:59:18|0:59:41|[Wang Weiyi] was driving a black car with the license plate PL3533, following a white Mazda at a distance. Suddenly, a taxi blocked [Wang Weiyi]'s path. When he tried to chase the car again, he reached a fork in the road with one side wider and the other narrower. [Wang Weiyi] hesitated for a moment before choosing the wider road on the right.
0:59:41|0:59:54|The street lamp at the intersection kept flickering, casting a fluctuating light on the road. Soon, Wang Weiyi realized he had taken the wrong path and immediately turned back, driving into the narrower road on the left.
0:59:54|1:0:15|After driving into a forest path, [Wang Weiyi] saw a white Mazda parked on the side of the road. The dim light cast a shadow on his face. He turned off the headlights and parked his car on another road. He walked stiffly towards the white Mazda. After a few steps, a beam of light illuminated the car's body. Someone emerged from the bushes. [Wang Weiyi] immediately hid.
1:0:16|1:0:29|[Hall Steward] opened the car door with a flashlight in hand and sat in the driver's seat. [Wang Weiyi] hid in the bushes quietly observing. In the drizzle, fine white lines were drawn in the light of the car headlights. [Hall Steward] drove away in a white Mazda from the woods.
1:0:36|1:1:3|Blind Sister lies naked on a cement bag, [Hua Zai Xiang] covers her chest, [Wang Weiyi] suddenly appears, grabs [Hua Zai Xiang] by the collar, and smashes him on the cement bag. [Hua Zai Xiang] pushes [Wang Weiyi] away fiercely, rushes out of the wooden house, grabs the pickaxe outside the door and swings it towards [Wang Weiyi]. [Hua Zai Xiang] uses the pickaxe to pin [Wang Weiyi] against a tree. [Wang Weiyi] forcefully pushes [Hua Zai Xiang] away, and [Hua Zai Xiang] strikes at him with the pickaxe.
1:1:3|1:1:33|[Wang Weiyi] tackled [Hua Zai Xiang] and rolled down the hill with him. [Hua Zai Xiang] got his leg caught in a trap, and [Wang Weiyi], like a wild beast released from its cage, climbed up from beside the rocks. His expression fierce, he menacingly approached [Hua Zai Xiang]. The area around [Wang Weiyi] was tinged with a bloody hue as he stared intently at the pickaxe on the ground. The pickaxe was trapezoidal in shape, with one end pointed and the other flat. Seeing [Wang Weiyi]'s expression, [Hua Zai Xiang] fearfully shuffled backwards.
1:1:33|1:1:57|[Wang Weiyi] stood in front of the pickaxe, trying hard to control his urge to kill. Suddenly, [Han Jiang] rushed out and grabbed the pickaxe, decisively stabbing it into [Hua Zai Xiang]'s abdomen. He turned to look at [Wang Weiyi] with a strange expression, then threw the pickaxe in front of [Wang Weiyi] and quickly fled the scene. [Wang Weiyi] hurried to chase after him, as [Han Jiang] ran into a grove illuminated by moonlight.
1:1:57|1:2:14|[Wang Weiyi] followed closely behind him into the depths of the forest. [Wang Weiyi] shouted in the mountains, with no one around. Suddenly, [Han Jiang]'s voice rang out.
1:2:25|1:2:31|[Wang Weiyi] looked at [Han Jiang] in shock as [Han Jiang] pointed a gun at his face.
1:2:39|1:2:44|During the day, Officer Mo arrived at the scene where Hua Zai Xiang died, observing Hua Zai Xiang's body.
1:3:14|1:3:23|[Chen Zhibin] stood behind a tree making a phone call to tip off, in the parking lot, [Wang Weiyi] lifted the hood of [Zhi Zha'en]'s car, broke the windshield, and then pried open the trunk.
1:3:23|1:3:34|[Wang Weiyi] arrived at the corner of the street, where vehicles were parked haphazardly. He saw someone hanging keys in the key cabinet on the roadside, and immediately made a phone call.
1:3:59|1:4:5|[Wang Weiyi] quietly took the key from the Hall Steward, who then walked back to the parking lot where his friend called out to him.
1:4:20|1:4:29|The garage uncle stood still as [Zhi Zha'en] ran to the back of the car, with the trunk wide open. He frantically pushed the spare tire hanging on the side back in.
1:4:29|1:4:59|The white Mazda parked outside the Kowloon Funeral Parlor, the headlights turned off. [Hall Steward], wearing a sports jacket, got out of the car and closed the door. He locked the car with the key and walked towards the funeral parlor. Suddenly, the car unlocked itself. [Hall Steward] turned around, walked back to the car, and locked it again. He looked around vigilantly, then raised his hand towards the front of the car and pressed the lock button again.
1:5:0|1:5:28|[Wang Weiyi] watched him from the shadows, and the trunk of the car was remotely opened by [Wang Weiyi]. [Hall Steward] cautiously walked to the rear of the car, looking around vigilantly. When he looked into the trunk, his eyes widened in surprise - there was a small bag of diamonds inside. At that moment, a black car pulled up and stopped by the roadside. [Zhi Zha'en] hurriedly got out of the car.
1:5:34|1:5:48|[Wang Weiyi] sat quietly in the car, on the rooftop of the high-rise building, [Hall Steward] sat with his head down in the steel ladder, [Zhi Zha'en] paced back and forth on the side, [Jingji Wen] slowly walked towards the two of them, stopping under the light.
1:7:8|1:7:42|[Jingji Wen] stared straight at [Hall Steward], and after a while, he spoke. The three of them arrived downstairs, [Jingji Wen] walked to the car door with his bag. He had just pressed the car key when he noticed the flat tire. [Jingji Wen] knocked on [Hall Steward]'s car window. After looking at his own car, he opened the door and sat in the passenger seat. [Wang Weiyi], with heavy dark circles under his eyes, stared at them like a ghost, while [Hall Steward] remained silent.
1:7:48|1:8:9|[Jingji Wen] turned to look at [Hall Steward], the trunk suddenly popped open. [Jingji Wen] turned to see the shaking trunk, while [Hall Steward] stared intently at the rearview mirror. [Jingji Wen] watched as he pointed to the trunk, the white Mazda turned right and stopped by the roadside. [Hall Steward] refused [Jingji Wen] and quickly walked to the rear of the car to open the trunk.
1:8:9|1:8:16|Diamonds scattered out of the black velvet bag, sparkling. [Jingji Wen] watched [Hall Steward]'s movements through the rearview mirror.
1:8:16|1:8:24|He opened the car door and [Hall Steward] immediately closed the trunk.
1:8:32|1:8:44|[Jingji Wen] glanced around and hurried across the street with a bag. But just as he reached the corner, he turned around and slowly walked to the signpost, secretly observing [Hall Steward]. [Hall Steward] was bent over, looking at something in the trunk.
1:8:44|1:8:48|Picking up the black velvet bag and putting it into the coat pocket, quickly closing the car trunk.
1:8:48|1:9:6|[Jingji Wen] was stunned by this scene, immediately hailed a taxi parked by the roadside, a white Mazda drove onto the road, then turned into a street under construction with tall buildings. The taxi following behind also stopped at the intersection of the street, and [Jingji Wen] got out of the car.
1:9:8|1:9:33|[Hall Steward] closed the car door, locked it, and quickly walked away. [Jingji Wen] walked along the wall, took out a key from his bag, approached a door shrouded in darkness, and unlocked it with the key. [Jingji Wen] then sidled through the iron gate, gently closed the door behind him. Inside the room, [Hall Steward] moved the statue of the ghost king from the shrine, and pulled out a velvet bag from the hole below.
1:9:33|1:10:5|He walked down the steps in front of the shrine, loosened the velvet bag's opening. At this moment, [Jingji Wen] and [Wang Weiyi] both arrived outside the house. [Hall Steward] poured out the two bags of diamonds on the table, looking at the diamonds with a smile. He collected all the diamonds on the table into the bag, tightened the opening, weighed it in his hand, then turned around and put the bag back into the hole under the statue of the Ghost King. All of this was seen by [Jingji Wen].
1:10:5|1:10:13|He slowly drew his gun, but the next second quickly retracted his body, as the [Hall Steward] walked out of the house with a key.
1:10:13|1:10:20|He closed the iron door without knowing that [Wang Weiyi] was watching him in the dark. [Hall Steward] was about to reach the car, but suddenly stopped and touched his pocket.
1:10:21|1:10:35|At this moment, in the room, Wen Ge took out a velvet bag, while [Hall Steward] unfolded the key and [Wang Weiyi] followed, leaning on the iron gate and looking inside. Wen Ge noticed someone staring at him and raised his head, it was [Hall Steward] at the door, "How did you get my key?"
1:10:58|1:11:13|How about splitting it in half, with [Hall Steward] keeping an eye on Brother Wen as he slightly turns his head. If you don't split, Brother Wen clenches the bag in his left hand and reaches for the handgun on the table with his right hand. [Wang Weiyi] quietly approaches the house, where the two inside are dividing the spoils. How long have we known each other?
1:11:50|1:11:58|[Hall Steward] fell to the ground in front of Wen Ge, who then kicked him back a few steps. Wen Ge pointed a gun at [Hall Steward].
1:12:9|1:12:25|[Hall Steward] wildly waved his arms trying to block the gun handle, but was hit and blood splattered everywhere. The gun was knocked out of his hand. Wen Ge used a rope to strangle [Hall Steward]'s neck. In a corner outside the door, a hand cautiously reached for the gun that had just flown over. [Wang Weiyi]'s face was hidden in the darkness.
1:12:33|1:12:45|Wen Ge desperately strangled [Hall Steward]'s neck. Suddenly, [Hall Steward] froze, and then weakly moved a bit before the hand holding the rope weakly dropped down. Everything in the room fell silent.
1:12:46|1:12:52|Wen Ge tied the car hood with a flower rope, and in the trunk was the body of Hall Steward, wrapped in black cloth and tied up.
1:12:53|1:13:15|Inside the Jiulong Funeral Parlor, Wen Ge drove the car into the garage of the funeral parlor, where several dark flower wreaths leaned against the wall. He walked around to the back of the car to check the trunk, then turned and walked out of the garage. [Wang Weiyi] parked the car outside the funeral parlor, climbed up the wooden frame outside the window, and quietly climbed in through the open window on the second floor. Wen Ge, carrying a bag, walked into the office area of the funeral parlor.
1:13:15|1:13:24|He touched his nose and walked to the innermost workstation. Wen placed the bag on the table, pulled out a storage box from under the table.
1:13:26|1:13:31|He took out the top square paper box and opened it, then untied a medium-sized velvet bag from the box.
1:13:33|1:13:57|Pour the white powder from the bag into the lid of the square paper box, he grabbed a handful of white powder, carefully picked out a few diamonds from the powder and placed them on the velvet bag. The trunk of the car in the garage has been opened by [Wang Weiyi], [Wang Weiyi] untied the black cloth on [Hall Steward], and found a mobile phone from [Hall Steward]'s coat. After pressing the phone, he quickly pressed the keyboard.
1:13:57|1:14:20|[Wang Weiyi] sneaked into the corridor filled with flower baskets. He gently pushed open a door and peeked into the room. Inside, [Jingji Wen] lifted the body dressed in funeral clothes from the coffin, reaching under the body. He gently placed the body on an iron bed, then took out a small velvet bag from his pocket. After weighing the bag in his hand, he pushed aside the miscellaneous items in the coffin.
1:14:20|1:14:27|He pulled back the yellow cloth at the bottom of the coffin, stuffed the bag underneath, covered it back up, and then pushed the door open to leave the morgue.
1:14:27|1:14:37|Outside the door, the flower basket was illuminated by the lights. [Jingji Wen] gradually walked away in the corridor, while [Wang Weiyi], who was hiding behind the flower basket, watched [Jingji Wen] leave and then walked into the morgue.
1:14:37|1:14:46|[Jingji Wen] walked into the garage swinging his arms, but was startled and stood frozen in place. He quickly ran to the back of the car, where the trunk was wide open and [Hall Steward] and the rope were both missing.
1:14:46|1:15:12|Jingji Wen walked into the room in horror, holding an axe. A car stopped outside the funeral parlor, and the visitor hurriedly approached the shop's folding door and took out a key. [Jingji Wen] went mad searching for something in the morgue. He picked up the axe placed on a customer's body, but as soon as he stepped out, he tripped and fell to the ground.
1:15:12|1:15:21|Tripping over him was the body of the Hall Steward, Jingji Wen crawled to pick up the axe, holding it up in fear and looking around. At this moment, Zhi Zha'en rushed in.
1:15:57|1:16:2|[Zhi Zha'en] glanced sideways at the [Hall Steward] on the ground.
1:16:22|1:16:53|[Jingji Wen] threw down the gun and walked away, then turned around and grabbed [Zhi Zha'en]. [Zhi Zha'en] hit [Jingji Wen], who grabbed the axe next to him and swung it towards him. [Zhi Zha'en] was kicked by [Jingji Wen] onto the coffin, and [Jingji Wen] grabbed his head and smashed it against the coffin. [Zhi Zha'en] screamed and tried to overpower [Jingji Wen], seizing the opportunity to grab his neck. [Jingji Wen] struggled underneath him but couldn't muster the strength. With a fierce look, [Zhi Zha'en] glared at [Jingji Wen], while [Wang Weiyi], who had been secretly observing, saw that [Jingji Wen] was at a disadvantage, so he picked up a screwdriver in front of him and threw it towards the two struggling men.
1:16:53|1:17:13|Jingji Wen grabbed a screwdriver and stabbed it into Zhi Zha'en's head. Zhi Zha'en immediately fell down. Jingji Wen, who was saved, coughed violently. Suddenly, he saw a figure leaving. He quickly picked up a gun, stood up, and staggered to chase outside. Wang Weiyi ran to the elevator and narrowly avoided being shot.
1:17:13|1:17:38|[Wang Weiyi] ran up the stairs, with Jingji Wen chasing him with a gun. [Wang Weiyi] reached the top floor and pushed open the door to the rooftop. Jingji Wen quickly followed onto the rooftop. [Wang Weiyi] ran along the diagonal of the rooftop to a huge neon sign at the funeral parlor. He slipped behind the shelves behind the sign, facing the overpass. Jingji Wen, panting heavily, ran towards him, ready to aim at him. [Wang Weiyi] leaped onto the overpass.
1:17:38|1:17:59|He somersaulted to his feet and ran to the bridge with a limp. On the other side, Jingji Wen could only cover his buttocks and return to the funeral parlor, leaning against a coffin and gasping for breath. He leaned out from the coffin, looking left and right at the bodies of his former comrades on the ground, beating his head in self-blame. Suddenly, he seemed to remember something?
1:17:59|1:18:2|Looking around with his head held high.
1:18:2|1:18:28|Jingji Wen's side face was illuminated by the light, his hair soaked with sweat. He slowly turned his head towards the light, and his right face twitched under the light. He immediately stood up and went to the control room. He unplugged the USB drive from the device and put it into the pocket of his coat. As he was about to leave, he took out his phone and saw that it was a text message from the Hall Steward's phone.
1:18:34|1:18:48|Jingji Wen stared intently at the monitor, and suddenly, in the top right corner of the surveillance footage, the figure of [Wang Weiyi] appeared. He opened the car door and sat in the driver's seat. Jingji Wen immediately lowered his head and dialed a phone number on his small white phone. The call was quickly answered.
1:19:2|1:19:14|Jingji Wen hung up the phone and continued to stare at the monitor screen. In the dark night, a white car arrived in front of an old teaching building, with a faint light coming from a room on the first floor.
1:20:27|1:20:41|The psychologist returned to the car and opened the door. She sat in the passenger seat, with the inspector in the driver's seat. After he closed the door, the inspector said,
1:21:0|1:21:7|Doctor pulled open the pure white body bag, revealing the face of the corpse. [Officer Mo] and others all looked at the body in front of them.
1:21:23|1:21:32|Officer Mo sighed at Han Jiang's body, while Chen Zhibin answered a phone call as he went out.
1:21:40|1:21:59|[Chen Zhibin] hung up the phone in a slight panic, while at the cemetery [Jingji Wen] threw the bodies of [Hall Steward] and [Zhi Zha'en] into a grave. After packing the soil with a shovel, he let out a long sigh looking up at the sky. [Jingji Wen] tossed the shovel aside, wiped the sweat off with his sleeve, and answered the phone. On the other end, [Chen Zhibin] said,
1:22:17|1:22:33|[Jingji Wen] grinned and hung up the phone. A female nurse in the hospital hurriedly walked into the grandmother's ward, pulled the partition curtain on the bed, turned on the bedside lamp. The grandmother lay quietly with an oxygen mask on, while the monitor next to her showed the amplitude of her heartbeat waves.
1:22:33|1:22:43|Mr. Wang, I am a nurse from Anmin Hospital. Your mother-in-law's condition is very serious. I suggest you come quickly. After hearing the nurse's words, [Wang Weiyi] felt the world suddenly spinning around him.
1:22:43|1:22:50|The car he was driving silently flipped on the bridge, surrounded by blood. He quickly walked into the hospital.
1:22:58|1:23:20|[Wang Weiyi] paused for a second, then quickened his pace towards his grandmother's ward. He walked through the dim corridor into the ward, slowly approached the opening of the partition, and paused when he saw his grandmother on the bed. He then walked to the bedside, widened his eyes, and stared at his grandmother's face in shock, with his mouth half open, seemingly unable to accept what he saw.
1:23:35|1:24:0|Upon hearing the last words, [Wang Weiyi] was instantly filled with tears. He took a few steps back as if struck by a heavy blow, hitting the wall. He looked at the ground in confusion, his pupils shaking violently. The intense emotions surged, making him gasp for breath. The sound of his crying broke through his throat, and he could no longer control himself. Tears streamed down uncontrollably. The nurse hurriedly advised, "Mr. Wang,..."
1:24:8|1:24:26|He pushed away the person next to him, howling in pain, slowly sliding down the wall to sit on the ground. The staff beside him patted his back to comfort him.
1:24:43|1:24:52|The nurse returned to the moving bed of the grandmother from the window, only to find that both [Wang Weiyi] and the grandmother were nowhere to be seen. He held the documents and looked into the distance.
1:24:55|1:25:1|[Wang Weiyi] drove out of the hospital with his deceased grandmother lying in the back seat.
1:25:4|1:25:20|[Wang Weiyi] saw the road rapidly compressing in front of his eyes. The dimly lit room in [Wang Weiyi]'s house only had a bedside lamp on, with his grandmother's body lying on [Wang Weiyi's Father]'s bed covered with a blanket. [Wang Weiyi] knelt in front of the bed, trembling all over, when suddenly his father appeared behind him.
1:25:50|1:26:13|[Wang Weiyi] looked at his grandmother sitting up with a look of grievance in her eyes. The bed in front of him suddenly became empty. He turned around abruptly and searched the room for his grandmother's figure. He walked back and forth in a panic, feeling the room spinning around him. He glanced at the door of the small room and, to his surprise, saw gasoline pouring in from the doorway. The gasoline quickly filled the entire floor.
1:26:14|1:26:40|The fire broke out at the door in an instant. He saw Grandma curled up on the sofa covering her ears. He immediately went over to shield Grandma with his body. As the fire burned more fiercely, he stood in front of Grandma, using his arms to block the flames. Inspector walked up the stairs with a bag on his back. He entered the corridor and arrived at the door of [Wang Weiyi's Father]'s house. Finding the door closed, he gently pushed it open and saw [Wang Weiyi] standing strangely inside the room.
1:26:40|1:26:59|The inspector saw the terrified look on the grandmother lying on the bed, [Wang Weiyi] calmed down slightly, still standing in place with a fearful expression.
1:26:59|1:27:11|The inspector looked again at the grandmother on the bed, moving slowly towards the bedside. The grandmother was covered with the gray and white striped blanket that Wang Weiyi often used, as if she was peacefully asleep.
1:27:12|1:27:38|The inspector saw the lifeless grandma with bruises all over her face. She turned to [Wang Weiyi] in shock, gasping for breath. She took out her phone, lit up the screen, and quickly dialed a number. Staring at [Wang Weiyi], she held the phone to her ear. After a waiting tone, the voice of a psychiatrist came through.
1:28:3|1:28:21|Inspector watched as [Wang Weiyi] stood trembling in the center of the room, slowly putting down his phone. He cautiously and fearfully approached [Wang Weiyi], who was sweating profusely and staring straight ahead. The inspector gently said,
1:28:23|1:28:46|[Wang Weiyi] blinked and seemed to be about to lose his balance. With his eyes darkened, [Wang Weiyi] sat on a chair next to the sofa. Sitting diagonally across from him was Officer Mo, who was quietly watching him. At that moment, a faint ringtone of a cellphone sounded.
1:28:59|1:29:33|Inspector calmly hung up the phone, slowly put down the mobile phone, [Jingji Wen] came to the door with a gun, he rushed into the house with a gun, holding the inspector hostage, [Wang Weiyi] looked up at him slightly, the inspector suddenly grabbed [Jingji Wen] by the hair, but [Jingji Wen] grabbed the inspector's head, pushing him to the corner of the wall. After being shot twice by [Wang Weiyi], [Jingji Wen] sat down on the sofa, [Wang Weiyi] approached him.
1:29:49|1:30:20|Inspector was covered in blood lying in the corner, [Jingji Wen] was shot in the leg by [Wang Weiyi], blood seeping around [Wang Weiyi]'s body, his smug smile turning bitter, his hand holding the gun trembling. The inspector anxiously looked at him from the corner, [Wang Weiyi] muttered tremblingly,
1:30:34|1:30:46|The grandmother and father's apparitions appear, [Wang Weiyi] stands with empty eyes, [Officer Mo] and another officer walk towards [Wang Weiyi]'s home.
1:31:5|1:31:11|Officer Mo and the police officer approached [Wang Weiyi], with [Han Jiang]'s emotions fluctuating in Wang Weiyi's mind.
1:31:26|1:31:37|[Wang Weiyi]'s hands trembled as he held the gun, the inspector on the ground looked anxiously at him. [Jingji Wen] under the gun had his hands shaking badly, his mouth opening and closing but no sound coming out.
1:31:37|1:31:53|[Wang Weiyi] furrowed his brow, the hand holding the gun slowly dropped down. The officer quickly approached [Wang Weiyi], who was knocked unconscious from behind by the officer. [Chen Zhibin] got off the white car and quietly entered [Wang Weiyi]'s house.
1:31:56|1:32:4|Leaning against the sofa, [Jingji Wen] saw [Chen Zhibin] and immediately lit up. [Chen Zhibin] quietly walked into the room from the entrance, leaving Officer Mo somewhat surprised.
1:32:15|1:32:41|Officer Mo and the police officer looked around the room, Chen Zhibin saw the gun under his feet, Jingji Wen's eyes flicked towards the direction of the gun, Chen Zhibin stood next to the gun and lightly kicked it towards Jingji Wen. Jingji Wen instantly picked up the gun, Officer Mo and the police officer fell to the ground in response. Chen Zhibin looked at Wang Weiyi, who was unconscious on the ground, took out a gun and shot Jingji Wen.
1:32:41|1:33:8|[Chen Zhibin] breathed a sigh of relief, while the [Wang Weiyi] on the ground rolled his eyes at him. [Chen Zhibin] quickly picked up the diamonds on the ground, with Officer Mo lying opposite him half-opened his eyes. Suddenly, [Chen Zhibin] stopped, raised his head and spotted the inspector in the corner. He immediately pulled out a handkerchief to pad his hand, picked up the gun and aimed at the inspector, pulling the trigger. The inspector was shot in the abdomen, and Mo Zixun rushed up to grab [Chen Zhibin]. Mo Zijun knocked [Chen Zhibin]'s gun away.
1:33:8|1:33:30|Pressing him against the window, fiercely squeezing his neck, the gun slowly approaching under Officer Mo's chin, Officer Mo fell onto [Chen Zhibin], who frantically pushed him away with the gun in his right hand. Sirens outside the window were heard, driving [Chen Zhibin] madly climbing up to the window, where he saw a velvet bag containing diamonds, dropping onto an iron plate several floors below.
1:33:30|1:33:57|[Chen Zhibin] quickly climbed down the scaffolding outside the window, grabbed the bag just as the bullet shot past his hand. Looking up, he saw [Wang Weiyi] aiming a gun at him. [Chen Zhibin] was shot, fell off the scaffolding, landed heavily on the roof of a white car, and then rolled to the ground. [Wang Weiyi] also climbed down the scaffolding. [Chen Zhibin] struggled to get up, covered in blood, and escaped.
1:33:57|1:34:22|[Wang Weiyi] leaped from the scaffolding, jumped onto the roof of the car, and then onto the ground, chasing after [Chen Zhibin]. [Chen Zhibin] ran back to the roadside and drove away in a white Toyota. [Wang Weiyi] could only chase after him with a gun in hand. He caught up as the Toyota turned a corner, and a bullet pierced through the windshield, hitting [Chen Zhibin] in the left shoulder. The car surged up a sloped section of the construction site and crashed into the gas station's signpost.
1:34:22|1:34:26|The car spun in the air and landed heavily on a white car.
1:34:26|1:34:30|After the white Toyota landed, it rolled and crashed into the convenience store at the gas station.
1:34:30|1:34:40|The massive car accident was finally contained. Reinforcements of police officers rushed over and chased after Wang Weiyi towards the gas station.
1:34:40|1:34:44|The burst water pipe sprayed a jet of water over ten meters high, causing the gas station sign to fall down.
1:34:49|1:35:6|[Wang Weiyi] quickly covered his face as the sign smashed through the roof of the gas station, crashing heavily onto the parked cars inside. As [Wang Weiyi] regained his senses, he raised his gun and walked briskly towards the convenience store inside the station. Suddenly, the knocked-over gas pump exploded.
1:35:13|1:35:36|The shockwave of the explosion shattered all the glass in the convenience store, pushing [Wang Weiyi] out to hit the car. Plainclothes police and special police surrounded the parking lot, where flames shot up, and the flames from the gas pump, accompanied by thick smoke, reached tens of meters high, illuminating a circle of low buildings around. With blood streaming down his head, [Wang Weiyi] leaned on the white car next to him and stood up, looking at the bright smile inside the car.
1:35:36|1:35:47|In the car, [Chen Zhibin] was covered in blood, barely conscious. He opened his eyes slightly and looked at [Wang Weiyi]. Suddenly, Wang Weiyi saw the mirror on the opposite side, reflecting a bloody light. In the mirror, the reflection was [Han Jiang].
1:35:47|1:36:2|[Wang Weiyi] stared blankly at the mirror, his arm holding the gun restrained from striking down. In the mirror, [Han Jiang] gazed back at him with determination, and his arm gradually lowered. [Wang Weiyi]'s pupils trembled slightly, and suddenly, another explosion caught him off guard from behind.
1:36:8|1:36:27|The black car outside the convenience store was slowly lifted into the air, and the glass behind [Wang Weiyi] was also shattered by the explosion. Standing amidst the flying sparks, [Wang Weiyi] recalled the moment when he killed [Hua Zai Xiang]'s [Han Jiang] with a pickaxe, aimed the gun at Wen Ge's [Han Jiang], which was actually himself.
1:36:43|1:36:53|[Wang Weiyi] roared as he fired repeatedly at the mirror, while [Han Jiang] in the mirror smirked eerily. [Wang Weiyi] looked in horror at the mirror, the handcuffs on his wrist dangling and swaying in the air.
1:36:54|1:37:1|He gradually began to look sad. Childhood memories flooded back, and a young [Han Jiang] resembling [Liang Yongxiong] was shouting for help in the burning house.
1:38:4|1:38:25|The furniture in the room was engulfed by flames, and [Liang Yongxiong], who was on fire, knelt weakly on the floor. [Wang Weiyi] detached himself from the memories, and in the mirror in front of him, [Han Jiang] still looked at him with a sinister smile. [Wang Weiyi] half-opened his mouth, took a breath, slowly raised the gun with both hands, pressed the muzzle against his chin, not far behind him,
1:38:26|1:38:32|Several fuel pumps exploded one after another, and at that moment, he heard a faint voice.
1:38:38|1:38:56|[Wang Weiyi] turned around and saw someone struggling in [Chen Zhibin]'s white car. He put down his gun and walked slowly towards the car. The person in the front seat was frantically patting out the fire on his body. [Wang Weiyi] looked at him in shock, his eyes wide open. It turned out to be [Liang Yongxiong].
1:39:8|1:39:14|[Wang Weiyi] quickly threw away the gun, grabbed [Liang Yongxiong]'s collar and dragged him outside, only to realize that the person being dragged was [Chen Zhibin].
1:39:14|1:39:38|[Wang Weiyi] grabbed [Chen Zhibin] tightly, the fire in the car had spread from [Chen Zhibin] to [Wang Weiyi]'s arm. He bravely pulled [Chen Zhibin] out of the car window, the flames engulfing [Chen Zhibin]. The fire had reached [Wang Weiyi]'s neck, leaving only his head exposed to the air. He frantically tried to put out the fire on [Chen Zhibin].
1:39:39|1:39:42|Outside the convenience store, flames were falling like rain from above.
1:39:42|1:39:47|[Wang Weiyi] screams in despair amidst the flames,
1:39:55|1:40:5|Soon, [Wang Weiyi]'s entire body was engulfed by the raging fire, with the flames from several fuel tanks reaching sky-high, illuminating the parking lot as bright as day.
1:40:5|1:40:9|White background burns with a few flying ashes of words. Twenty-five years ago.
1:40:10|1:40:32|People shouted to protect their homes, facing unreasonable eviction and homelessness. They held banners and confronted riot police. [Liang Yongxiong], wearing riot gear, was hit by [Wang Weiyi's Father] with a stick. A young [Wang Weiyi] followed the adults and kept hitting [Liang Yongxiong] with a stick. The fiery [Wang Fu] picked up a kerosene stove and threw it at the riot police.
1:40:33|1:41:3|Liang Yongxiong used a shield to push away the kerosene stove, causing the kerosene inside to splash out onto [Wang Weiyi's Father]. [Wang Weiyi's Father] was engulfed in flames, while Liang Yongxiong and the violent police officers watched helplessly as he burned alive. [Wang Weiyi] secretly followed Liang Yongxiong home afterwards, standing at the corner of the corridor filled with hatred as he watched Liang Yongxiong, who was unaware, carrying the purchased items into the house.
1:41:9|1:41:15|[Wang Weiyi] sat at the doorstep of Liang Yongxiong's house, struck a match, and the flame gradually weakened, everything hidden in darkness.
1:41:45|1:41:54|The streets of the Hong Kong Industrial and Commercial Guild are sunny, with passersby picking up oranges scattered on the ground. An old lady runs towards a cardboard box.
