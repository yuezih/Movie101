0:2:48|0:3:5|In the feudal and dark ages ruled by Yan Xishan in Shanxi, in the impoverished and hungry old society, the childhood of [Liu Hulan] began early labor.
0:3:5|0:3:9|In the field, [Liu Hulan] is plowing the land with a donkey, accompanied by [Grandfather].
0:3:16|0:3:26|[Liu Hulan] started playing in the fields, squatting on the ground and touching the soil with both hands.
0:3:27|0:3:31|[Liu Hulan] stood up, and [Grandfather] pointed at him with a street pole.
0:3:43|0:3:46|[Liu Hulan] pushed aside her bangs and glared at [Grandfather].
0:3:47|0:3:48|Liu's Mom walked over.
0:3:58|0:4:4|[Liu Hulan] ran towards [Liu's Dad], and [Grandfather], who was still working, turned his head to look at him.
0:4:12|0:4:31|The neighbor patted [Liu Hulan]'s shoulder, and [Liu's Mom] also walked over.
0:4:31|0:4:33|Guihua and a group of children ran over.
0:4:44|0:4:57|[Liu Hulan] embraced Guihua, the neighbor's son Xiaoqing followed along, [Liu's Mom] watched the children's figures as they walked confidently into the distance.
0:5:2|0:5:12|They came to the harvested farmland, bowing their heads and searching around. When they saw scattered bones, they picked them up and put them in their own baskets.
0:5:12|0:5:20|Not far away, farmers are still harvesting wheat.
0:5:20|0:5:25|Landlord [Lv Shanqing] with a pipe in his mouth, arrived at the farmland with his wife.
0:5:25|0:5:30|They looked at the children in confusion, and Guihua and a boy suddenly started fighting.
0:5:40|0:5:59|[Liu Hulan] took the pipe out of his mouth and walked towards them. [Liu Hulan] turned around to look at [Liu's Mom]. [Liu's Mom] and his wife kept getting closer, while the other children all stepped back several steps. Only [Liu Hulan] stood still without fear, glaring at [Liu's Mom].
0:6:4|0:6:17|Guifamei put down the basket, and [Liu Hulan] picked it up again, carrying it on her arm.
0:6:17|0:6:29|Madam snatched it away and gave [Liu Hulan] a slap. [Liu Hulan] pushed aside her bangs and glared at her with resentment.
0:6:29|0:6:31|Liu Hulan's lackey, [Lü Shanqing], runs over from a distance.
0:6:38|0:6:46|[Liu Hulan] quickly called his wife to run together, the farmers on the side stopped to watch them, and the children took two steps forward.
0:6:46|0:6:53|[Liu Hulan] turned around and waved, the children followed him as they walked forward.
0:6:53|0:6:55|In the field, Shi Dehui runs towards Liu Hulan's father.
0:7:7|0:7:13|In the village, the villagers are all running home with their children.
0:7:13|0:7:19|Outside the house of landlord Lv Shanqing, several men were loading luggage onto a donkey cart and tying them up.
0:7:24|0:7:35|[Liu Hulan] and the children also returned to the village, stopping by the donkey cart.
0:7:35|0:7:41|The children all watched as the busy waiter, [Liu Hulan], kept giving them sidelong glances.
0:7:41|0:7:53|The lackeys gestured for their companions to go first, while another lackey led a sedan chair to the door. Lv Shanqing came out of the house carrying a box.
0:7:56|0:8:3|Mrs. Liu hurried to catch up and then stopped in her tracks.
0:8:3|0:8:10|The Red Army marched in a neat line towards the village.
0:8:10|0:8:14|Lü Shanqing has already sat in the carriage.
0:8:14|0:8:19|Mrs. Liu Hulan came out, threw the jewelry box and bundle into the carriage, and sat down.
0:8:20|0:8:32|The lackey drove the carriage away, [Liu Hulan] picked up a piece of dirt from the ground and threw it at the carriage. Li Shanqing stuck his head out of the carriage and glared at him, while the children jumped and clapped.
0:8:32|0:8:33|The carriage gradually drove away.
0:8:38|0:8:51|The children stopped, and the Red Army entered the village. The children turned around and walked towards the Red Army. Several children's parents ran over to take them away. [Liu Hulan]'s mother also hurried back and was about to take [Liu Hulan] away.
0:9:15|0:9:22|The instructor squatted down in front of him.
0:9:22|0:9:26|The instructor picked up [Liu Hulan].
0:9:26|0:9:29|[Liu Hulan] touched Sun the instructor's military cap.
0:9:29|0:9:31|A soldier runs over.
0:9:34|0:9:38|Sun Instructor put down [Liu Hulan], and [Liu Hulan] ran to her mother with a smile.
0:9:38|0:9:39|Shi Dehui is striking a large bell.
0:9:59|0:10:3|The villagers gathered together, with the village leader looking at everyone.
0:10:49|0:11:3|The villagers were all smiles as the Red Army soldiers distributed food to everyone, and [Liu Hulan]'s grandfather happily hoisted a bag of food that he received.
0:11:3|0:11:8|Instructor Sun embraced [Liu Hulan] and chatted and laughed with Shi Dehui.
0:11:8|0:11:16|A villager excitedly shook hands with [Liu Hulan], Grandfather smiled with his pipe in hand, and Shi Dehui couldn't help but show a happy smile.
0:11:18|0:11:35|Red Army soldiers marched away in formation, bid farewell by the villagers. Grandfather walked hand in hand with a soldier, while Comrade Sun stopped to say goodbye to the villagers following behind, patting [Liu Hulan]'s head before continuing on with the troops.
0:11:35|0:11:41|[Liu Hulan] chased after him, Instructor Sun picked him up, comforted him, then put him down, waving goodbye to the villagers.
0:11:52|0:12:6|One day, Liu Hulan's mom was pushing the stone mill in the courtyard, round and round.
0:12:6|0:12:10|She wiped the sweat off her shoulders with a towel, stopped in her tracks, and smiled as she looked towards the door.
0:12:12|0:12:25|[Liu Hulan] ran back with many bamboo poles in her arms. She placed the poles outside the donkey shed, broke off a small piece, held it out to the donkey's mouth, then withdrew it and offered it again, playing with the donkey.
0:12:25|0:12:34|Mom looked at [Liu Hulan] with a smile, and [Liu Hulan] patted the donkey's head.
0:12:35|0:12:37|[Liu Hulan] turned and smiled, bouncing towards her mother.
0:12:44|0:13:3|[Liu Hulan] stood beside her mother, pushing with her for ten years. Her small stature didn't even reach her mother's shoulders.
0:13:3|0:13:9|Along the tragic path of rural women in China for thousands of years, [Liu Hulan] gradually grew up.
0:13:11|0:13:19|Grown-up Liu Hulan is still pushing the stone mill in the courtyard with her mother.
0:13:19|0:13:31|[Liu Hulan] has grown taller, and her mom has aged a lot. Her mom stopped to wipe away the sweat.
0:13:31|0:13:39|Liu's Mom picked up a small roller with one hand, gathered the grains in the middle, and used the other hand to help her daughter push together.
0:13:39|0:13:41|She walked side by side with her daughter again.
0:13:47|0:13:58|[Grandfather] walked out of the house, carrying a basket and sat down on the side with a cane, picking up some old straw to twist into a rope.
0:13:58|0:14:5|Guìhuāmèi and her mother walked out of the house and approached [Liu Hulan]'s [Grandfather].
0:14:20|0:14:28|Guihua Mei took the donkey whip off the wall and ran to Xiaoqing's side.
0:14:28|0:14:33|Xiaoqing took the donkey whip, and Guihua helped her brother check the donkey's body with the whip.
0:14:33|0:14:36|Xiaoqing led the donkey to the front of [Grandfather] Liu Hulan.
0:14:47|0:14:49|Upon hearing this, [Liu Hulan] gave a glare.
0:15:43|0:15:44|Liu Hulan tosses her head.
0:15:56|0:15:59|Mom walked into the room, [Liu Hulan] with a stern face, preparing the donkey saddle.
0:16:4|0:16:6|[Grandfather] stood up and walked towards him.
0:16:11|0:16:14|In the house, [Liu's Father] lay on the bed and said.
0:16:38|0:16:41|Liu's Mom hurriedly ran to the courtyard and grabbed the donkey rope.
0:16:48|0:16:50|[Liu Hulan] pulled the donkey rope and walked away.
0:16:59|0:17:3|Xiaoqing left with the donkey, and Guihua helped her with the bamboo basket on the donkey's back.
0:17:3|0:17:13|Liu's Mom looked on anxiously, while Grandfather and Xiaoying's mother also watched their backs.
0:17:13|0:17:19|[Liu Hulan] walked ahead, with Xiaoqing and a donkey in tow, heading towards the village outskirts.
0:17:19|0:17:25|The villagers were busy, while two black pigs leisurely walked on the road in the opposite direction.
0:17:26|0:17:38|The two of them then set off together on a long journey.
0:17:38|0:17:48|In winter, they arrived at the forest, where the trees were all bare. [Liu Hulan] led the donkey downhill and uphill, crossing a large ditch, with Xiaoqing following behind.
0:17:55|0:18:2|On the snowy ground, Xiaoqing leads the donkey in front, and the donkey's feet keep slipping.
0:18:2|0:18:9|Xiaoqing turned her head and looked at [Liu Hulan], who was steadily leading the donkey forward, with the donkey's hooves occasionally slipping.
0:18:18|0:18:28|In the summer, in the same forest, where the trees are lush, [Liu Hulan] and Xiaoqing are leading a donkey loaded with supplies, crossing the same large ditch as before.
0:18:28|0:18:39|While climbing up the hill, the bamboo basket on the side of the donkey led by [Liu Hulan] had been pressed down significantly.
0:18:39|0:18:45|They continued to walk back, with [Liu Hulan] riding on the back of a donkey, Xiaoqing urging her own donkey with a whip.
0:18:50|0:18:54|[Liu Hulan] dismounted from the donkey and led it forward.
0:18:54|0:19:3|The clouds were thick, the weather was hot and humid, with only a few gentle breezes swaying the leaves.
0:19:3|0:19:11|They tied the donkey to the large trees in front.
0:19:11|0:19:19|[Liu Hulan] rolled up his pants legs, feeling exhausted. He walked to the shade of a tree and sat down, using the hem of his shirt to fan himself.
0:19:27|0:19:37|Xiaoqing also sat down beside him, took off the towel wrapped around his head, and wiped the sweat off.
0:20:24|0:20:29|[Liu Hulan] thought for a moment.
0:20:30|0:20:33|Xiaoqing's eyes were determined.
0:20:35|0:20:50|The two looked towards the direction of the donkey, which was untangling the rope tied to the tree. Xiaoqing ran over to hold the donkey, [Liu Hulan] followed and took a look. He turned around and looked up at the sky, the wind grew stronger, blowing the leaves violently shaking, dark clouds drifting over.
0:20:54|0:21:7|At home, Grandfather also looked up at the sky, and the clothesline behind him swung vigorously. Liu's Mom, Xiaqing's Mom, and Guihua hurried to collect the clothes. Liu's Mom returned to the courtyard with a hoe, and everyone gathered around.
0:21:27|0:21:27|Everyone went back to the house.
0:21:49|0:21:55|It started to rain heavily from the sky, and many villagers in the village ran out with their belongings on their backs.
0:21:55|0:21:58|[Liu Hulan] and Xiaoqing were pulling the donkey against the crowd and walking back.
0:21:58|0:22:4|The henchman of landlord Lv Shanqing was struggling to pull the carriage, and the two happened to run into him.
0:22:4|0:22:7|The lackey whipped their donkey, and [Liu Hulan] glared at him.
0:22:8|0:22:22|Lv Shanqing lifted the curtain and looked out from the carriage. Upon catching a glimpse of [Liu Hulan], he bypassed them. Lv Shanqing dropped the curtain, and the lackey continued to lead the carriage forward. The two turned their heads to look at them, then pulled the donkey back and continued walking.
0:22:49|0:23:1|[Liu's Father] and Liu's Mom walked out of the house with Xiaoqing's mother.
0:23:1|0:23:5|Several people returned to the house, and [Liu's Mom] wiped the rainwater off [Liu Hulan].
0:23:15|0:23:24|On the other side, Lv Shanqing looked at the village chief's appointment and burst into laughter.
0:23:24|0:23:32|The wife sat beside him fanning him, the lackey handed him a large pipe, Lv Shanqing put away his smile and looked at the lackey.
0:23:32|0:23:39|The Japanese Imperial Army sent down two thousand catties of flour, with a three-day deadline for payment. The lackeys started smoking their pipes.
0:23:39|0:23:41|The knocking on the door attracted three people.
0:23:41|0:23:42|The lackey walked out.
0:24:30|0:24:34|Hearing a voice, the two of them put away their smiles, looked at each other in confusion, and [Liu's Mom] walked in.
0:24:44|0:25:0|[Liu's Mom] took off her hat. Lv Shanqing picked up the appointment letter, looked at his wife, thought for a moment, and said to [Liu's Mom].
0:25:0|0:25:5|Lü Shanqing handed the appointment letter and the big pipe to [Liu's Mom], then walked out with his hands behind his back, pausing for a moment.
0:25:9|0:25:17|He walked to the living room door, looked in through the door curtain, and saw the person holding a notebook.
0:25:17|0:25:31|The script reads: "Lu Shanqing, landlord, village chief of Xicun in Yunzhou, is cunning and deceitful, always seeking personal gain at the expense of others. He consistently oppresses the masses and is suspected of colluding with the Japanese invaders. It is difficult to unite with such a person."
0:25:31|0:25:38|The man put down the notebook, and Lv Shanqing walked into the living room with a smile.
0:25:45|0:25:46|[Grandfather] put the notebook in his pocket.
0:25:48|0:25:52|The two sat down, while another comrade stood by.
0:26:13|0:26:23|Lu Shanqing stood up and poured a cup of water for [Grandfather].
0:26:23|0:26:26|Lu Shanqing sat down.
0:27:14|0:27:17|The lackey walked in carrying wine and food.
0:27:17|0:27:20|Comrade Sun stood up.
0:27:20|0:27:24|Another comrade caught up with him.
0:27:40|0:27:44|[Liu Hulan] gestured with her eyes, and the lackey followed.
0:27:44|0:27:49|He smiled and watched the two of them leave, nodding at them.
0:27:49|0:27:55|After the two left the living room, the smile on [Liu Hulan]'s face disappeared.
0:27:55|0:28:2|He paced back and forth in the living room with his hands behind his back.
0:28:2|0:28:5|He frowned and stared in the direction of the door.
0:29:41|0:29:43|[Grandfather] nods.
0:29:58|0:30:6|The anti-Japanese village office was established in Yunchouxi Village, and the villagers were very happy, walking in groups into the village office.
0:30:6|0:30:14|In the agricultural association, Shi Dehui handed a piece of paper with words written on it to a villager. The villager took the paper and walked to the side, looking at it with a joyful expression on his face.
0:30:18|0:30:28|In the room, there is a paper on the wall with the words "Militia for Protection" written on it. The young men are happily polishing their gun barrels.
0:30:28|0:30:34|On the other side, [Liu Hulan] borrowed a stack of fabric brought by her sister Guihua, and the women were all sewing and mending.
0:30:34|0:30:42|Guifah Mei sat down and looked at the wall, where a notice was written, stating that fifty sets of military uniforms must be completed within five days, and the old meeting will be held on June 2nd.
0:30:44|0:30:55|One day, a Communist soldier wrote a note on paper and handed it to [Liu Hulan], who then wrote "I love my country" with a brush following the note.
0:30:55|0:31:5|Later, [Liu Hulan] taught the women to read, with "Long live the Communist Party of China" written on the blackboard.
0:31:15|0:31:21|In the room, [Liu Hulan] paces back and forth, recalling the conversation with her husband and the informant.
0:31:48|0:31:59|Lv Shanqing paced back and forth, deep in thought, before finally slamming his fist on the table.
0:31:59|0:32:8|In the village, Grandfather lit a lantern with a match, and the surroundings lit up.
0:32:8|0:32:10|Villagers are bidding farewell to their sons.
0:32:16|0:32:31|Shi Dehui walked over, a militiaman asked, "Is Xiaoqing's mother also sending Xiaoqing out with everyone? Guifang helped her brother carry the luggage."
0:32:44|0:32:53|The three of them moved away from the direction of their home.
0:32:53|0:33:8|They walked side by side on the road, with Guifeng standing in the middle. She smiled and looked at [Liu Hulan], handing the bundle to her.
0:33:8|0:33:10|Guifahmei left, and the two watched her walk away.
0:33:13|0:33:27|Xiaoqing turned to look at [Liu Hulan], and the two of them continued to walk forward.
0:33:32|0:33:36|The two stopped in their tracks, [Liu Hulan] looked at Xiaoqing.
0:33:52|0:33:56|[Liu Hulan] shyly lowers her head.
0:34:28|0:34:43|Shi Dehui walked over, [Liu Hulan] and Xiaoqing glanced at each other. Shi Dehui took out a piece of paper and handed it to Xiaoqing. It was a letter of introduction. Now it's time to gather the team and get ready to set off.
0:34:47|0:34:49|Grandfather also walked over.
0:35:0|0:35:6|Xiaoqing left with her bundle, and [Liu Hulan] followed.
0:35:14|0:35:18|Shi Dehui stopped, and [Liu Hulan] caught up.
0:35:18|0:35:22|In front of Shi Dehui, he lowered his head again.
0:35:42|0:35:53|[Liu Hulan] turned around in despair, with her back facing Shi Dehui.
0:35:53|0:35:59|[Liu Hulan] turned around, and Shi Dehui turned his head to look into the distance.
0:35:59|0:36:3|The two of them walked over together.
0:36:3|0:36:8|In Lv Shanqing's home, he and his wife are packing up things in the house, getting ready to move.
0:36:17|0:36:24|Liu Hulan looked at a piece of paper, then folded it up and walked over to the lackey.
0:36:24|0:36:31|Mrs. Liu kept gesturing, making Lv Shanqing a little anxious.
0:36:31|0:36:36|The lackey cautiously opened the door, slowly peeked out, and looked around vigilantly.
0:36:43|0:36:48|He walked out to take a look, then hurried back to close the door.
0:36:48|0:36:58|At this moment, Shi Dehui led Xiaoqing and others out, passing by the home of Lü Shanqing.
0:36:58|0:37:0|The patrolling militia encountered them.
0:37:16|0:37:28|When everyone had passed by, the lackey sneaked out again and peeked around the pillar.
0:37:28|0:37:36|After making sure no one was around, he put on his hat and waved to signal that Liu Shanching could come out.
0:37:36|0:37:40|Lü Shanqing walked out, his wife following behind.
0:37:41|0:37:47|Lü Shanqing pushed the lackey forward, but turned around and bumped into his wife.
0:37:47|0:37:52|The bundle fell to the ground, and he quickly picked it up.
0:37:52|0:37:57|Mrs. Liu linked arms with Lv Shanqing, the two of them alert to their surroundings, followed by the lackeys, and ran away together.
0:38:8|0:38:22|The barking of a dog attracted Shi Xingwang's attention. He turned around and saw the door of the Lv Shanqing family open, so he ran over and went in to check.
0:38:22|0:38:33|Before long, [Shi Xingwang] ran out and looked around. [Shi Dehui], [Liu Hulan], and Guifhua Meimei had just finished seeing off Xiaoqing and were coming back. [Shi Xingwang] ran over.
0:38:35|0:38:39|[Shi Dehui] and the others took a few steps forward and looked into the house.
0:38:39|0:38:42|Hearing the dog barking, the group turned to look.
0:38:46|0:38:53|[Shi Dehui] and [Shi Xingwang] left, [Liu Hulan] and Guifhua followed a few steps, stopped and watched their backs.
0:38:53|0:39:0|The two of them frowned and exchanged a glance.
0:39:0|0:39:1|Shortly after, [Shi Dehui] returned.
0:39:13|0:39:31|Three of them left. On that day, the wind was howling, and a militiaman climbed up the village wall at the entrance, holding a gun on guard duty.
0:39:34|0:39:48|Under the city wall, two militia members looked around vigilantly, then returned to the village and closed the gate.
0:39:48|0:39:52|In the room, [Shi Dehui] was reading attentively by the dim light of a kerosene lamp.
0:40:9|0:40:18|[Shi Dehui] looked up and sensed that something was wrong.
0:40:18|0:40:28|The sound of the mirror woke up the villagers who were sleeping, and they quickly woke up the people next to them. [Liu Hulan] and her family also got dressed and got out of bed.
0:40:28|0:40:34|Outside the village, there is a group of people riding horses. The horse team stops, and we see Lv Shanqing pointing in a direction with a Japanese man.
0:40:38|0:40:45|With a wave of the Japanese's hand, they spurred their horses forward quickly.
0:40:45|0:40:50|The alarm bells kept ringing, and the villagers fled with their belongings and families.
0:40:50|0:41:2|Shi Dehui, Guihuamei, [Liu Hulan] directed the villagers to leave in an orderly manner. [Liu Hulan] picked up the fallen baggage and handed it to the villagers. Qingyunsao held her son's hand, stopped, and shouted for her child's father in the crowd.
0:41:2|0:41:5|The militiamen on the city wall saw the cavalry approaching the village entrance quickly.
0:41:8|0:41:13|Everyone is evacuating quickly.
0:41:13|0:41:18|Qingyun's sister-in-law and her son were swept away by the flood, and the son stood in place crying.
0:41:18|0:41:25|Qingyun's sister-in-law wanted to come back, but she was pushed further and further away from her son by the crowd.
0:41:25|0:41:30|Militiamen dropped grenades from the city tower towards the horsemen.
0:41:30|0:41:33|On the other side, [Liu Hulan] heard the crying of the child and looked around.
0:41:36|0:41:39|Here, the soldiers in the camp ran out of bullets and hurriedly descended from the city tower.
0:41:44|0:41:54|[Liu Hulan] found the little boy in the corner and picked him up, then ran away. By this time, the villagers had already evacuated, and Aunt Qingyun rushed back to see her son.
0:41:54|0:42:10|The militiamen coming down from the city wall met them. After a few words, the militiamen carried Qingyun's wife and ran forward. [Liu Hulan] looked back and saw the cavalry rushing into the village, so she had to run in the opposite direction with the little boy. She found a cellar and hid inside with the little boy.
0:42:13|0:42:24|The Japanese are nearby, and [Liu Hulan] ran a few steps deeper into the cellar.
0:42:24|0:42:38|The little boy was still crying, so [Liu Hulan] had to cover the boy's mouth first.
0:42:38|0:42:40|There is a hand grenade explosion outside, at the entrance of the cellar.
0:42:40|0:42:43|After the Japanese left, [Liu Hulan] sat up and wiped the tears from the little boy's eyes.
0:43:20|0:43:26|[Liu Hulan] looked outside, then hugged the little boy, dragging her feet slowly towards the cellar entrance.
0:43:48|0:44:1|[Liu Hulan] walked with a little boy in her arms through the village, with fires still burning in some places.
0:44:1|0:44:6|Looking at the dilapidated village, [Liu Hulan] couldn't believe her eyes, with a vacant look in them.
0:44:17|0:44:26|The villagers gathered around [Liu Hulan], and Qingyun took her son from her hands.
0:44:26|0:44:30|[Liu Hulan] stood there blankly, tears welling up in her eyes.
0:44:38|0:44:44|[Liu Hulan] glanced around at the villagers beside her.
0:44:55|0:44:57|Everyone's gaze was very determined.
0:45:9|0:45:20|The sign of the Anti-Japanese Village Office in Yunzhou West Village has been burned. On this day, [Liu Hulan] and Shi Dehui hung it up again, and the villagers gathered around to watch.
0:45:37|0:45:45|One day, [Liu Hulan] sat by the stove burning fire, Grandfather sat smoking on the side, while Liu's Mom was busy on the kang with a bamboo whip in her hand.
0:46:22|0:46:26|The whole village was crying, and the children were crying even more.
0:46:33|0:46:49|[Liu Hulan] stood up, lifted the lid, and stirred the watery porridge in the pot with a ladle, which had no rice in it.
0:46:49|0:46:52|Liu's Mom is picking millet from the winnowing basket.
0:47:2|0:47:14|Grandfather continued to smoke his pipe, while Liu's Mom and [Liu Hulan] were each busy with their own tasks.
0:47:14|0:47:21|Qingyun's wife came into the room with the child and Guihuamei. [Liu Hulan] greeted them and sat with them by the kang.
0:47:48|0:47:52|[Liu's Mom] and [Liu Hulan] lowered their heads.
0:48:19|0:48:30|[Liu Hulan] and [Liu's Mom] poured all the millet from the winnowing pan into a bowl and handed it to Aunt Qingyun.
0:48:36|0:48:40|Qingyun looked at Grandfather, then at the child in her arms.
0:48:40|0:48:44|Guifang glanced at the child, turned her head, her face filled with worry.
0:48:54|0:48:56|[Liu Hulan] pats her clothes and walks out.
0:48:57|0:48:58|Guifhua Mei runs over.
0:49:33|0:49:40|Guifang nodded, [Liu Hulan] left, and Guifang turned around with a smile on her face.
0:49:40|0:49:56|In the room, [Liu's father] smiled and said to [Liu's mother].
0:49:56|0:49:57|Shi Xingwang left with a gun on his back.
0:50:32|0:50:36|[Liu Hulan] tears welled up in her eyes.
0:50:36|0:50:40|At the group meeting, [Liu Hulan] shed a line of tears and said.
0:51:7|0:51:9|Shi Xingwang runs over.
0:51:32|0:51:35|At the village entrance, [Liu's Father], [Liu Hulan], and others ran towards Comrade Sun.
0:52:39|0:52:43|Everyone clapped excitedly.
0:53:6|0:53:26|Comrade Sun led the team away, waving goodbye to the villagers, while the villagers were all working in the fields in the spring.
0:53:30|0:53:37|A person driving a cow and a donkey together leaves, waving to [Liu's Father] driving two donkeys on the opposite side.
0:53:55|0:54:1|[Liu Hulan] and Guifhua Meimei were pushing and pulling together, controlling the two baskets on the unicycle.
0:54:1|0:54:8|Liu Hulan's mother walked over, and the two stopped. Liu Hulan took off the towel around her neck and wiped the sweat off.
0:54:21|0:54:25|The two continued on.
0:54:51|0:55:0|The donkey kept lifting off the ground, dumping baskets of manure into the field, while [Liu Hulan] and Guifeng were busy transporting the manure.
0:55:0|0:55:12|Slowly, [Liu Hulan] began to feel a bit unsteady, swaying from side to side. Without support, the unicycle tilted to one side. She struggled to lift the unicycle back up and continued on.
0:55:12|0:55:17|Before long, [Liu Hulan] fainted, and Guifeng quickly ran over.
0:55:23|0:55:32|At home, [Liu Hulan] lies on the kang, looking haggard and unconscious.
0:55:32|0:55:40|Liu's Mom held her, and Guihua also stood by to take care of her.
0:55:40|0:55:44|Later, [Grandfather] handed a bowl of water to Mom, and several women gathered around the kang.
0:55:50|0:56:0|Mom feeds [Liu Hulan] some water, and [Liu Hulan] slowly starts to recover.
0:56:0|0:56:2|A woman approached her and said.
0:56:26|0:56:32|Shi Dehui walked over with a dustpan, he glanced at [Liu Hulan], then looked at Guifang.
0:56:36|0:56:41|Guifahmei took the winnowing basket, and [Liu Hulan] grabbed her.
0:57:12|0:57:15|[Liu Hulan] leaned back, and Guifeng looked at Shi Dehui.
0:57:28|0:57:33|[Liu Hulan] then lowered her eyes and bowed her head.
0:57:37|0:57:40|Guifahmei left with a winnowing basket.
0:57:46|0:57:48|[Liu Hulan] smiled.
0:57:53|0:58:5|Before long, the millet, sorghum, and rice were all growing vigorously.
0:58:5|0:58:9|A person riding a horse gallops from a distance, urging the horse on.
0:58:21|0:58:32|The person walked through the field path, arrived at the village entrance, stopped for a while, and then rode the horse in.
0:58:42|0:58:47|Shi Dehui, [Liu Hulan], Guihua and Xiaoqing's mother were all very excited.
0:58:47|0:58:51|Liu's father's parents brought Grandfather out, and Grandfather was overjoyed.
0:58:51|0:58:59|The villagers, Liu Hulan's family, all ran out of the house, feeling very excited and happy.
0:58:59|0:59:0|Everyone gathered around Xiaoqing.
0:59:16|0:59:34|Xiaoqing dismounted from the horse, everyone surrounded her with smiles on their faces. Guifang excitedly hugged [Liu Hulan].
0:59:59|1:0:17|On the pillar in front of the house hangs a sign for the Anti-Japanese Village Office of Xicun in Yunzhou, and under the eaves hangs a sign for the Democratic Village Office of Xicun in Yunzhou, both of them brand new.
1:0:17|1:0:26|On this day, under the sunny sky, [Liu Hulan] and Xiaoqing sat under a big tree, with the horse tied to the tree nearby.
1:0:26|1:0:29|Xiaoqing looked at [Liu Hulan] and hesitated to speak.
1:0:31|1:0:36|[Liu Hulan] lowered her head, glanced at Xiaoqing, and then smiled as she looked into the distance.
1:0:47|1:0:52|The two looked around at the peaceful scenery.
1:1:6|1:1:11|Xiaoqing stood up.
1:1:54|1:1:59|[Liu Hulan] also stood up, took a few steps forward, and continued to smile as she looked into the distance.
1:2:18|1:2:22|Xiaoqing put her hand on [Liu Hulan]'s shoulder.
1:2:25|1:2:29|[Liu Hulan] looked at Xiaoqing, who smiled even more brightly.
1:2:50|1:2:54|[Liu Hulan] stood still, watching Xiaqing's back.
1:2:54|1:3:6|Xiaoqing went to untie the rope tied to the horse, and rode the horse to stand in front of [Liu Hulan].
1:3:6|1:3:13|Xiaoqing rides away on a horse.
1:3:13|1:3:16|[Liu Hulan] watched as he gradually went away, disappearing from view.
1:3:36|1:3:43|In July 1946, instigated by the American imperialists, the Jiang bandits violently launched a new counter-revolutionary war against the people.
1:4:9|1:4:12|The bandits led by Yuan Yishan have arrived at Pingchuan.
1:4:27|1:4:30|The villagers brought their own grains and vegetables one after another.
1:4:30|1:4:43|[Liu Hulan] and Guifeng happily put all these feed and old items on the carriage.
1:4:43|1:4:44|The two of them left the village in a horse-drawn carriage.
1:4:48|1:5:3|On the front line, a soldier carrying a wounded comrade with an injured right leg, Comrade Sun helped him to put the wounded down, and then spoke to the soldier.
1:5:3|1:5:14|Comrade Sun squatted down to examine the leg injury of the wounded.
1:5:14|1:5:16|[Liu Hulan] and Guifeng brought food for Grandfather.
1:5:17|1:5:24|[Liu Hulan] threw the whip onto the carriage, walked up to Comrade Sun, and took off the towel around her neck to wipe off the sweat.
1:6:6|1:6:8|Comrade Sun helped him sit down.
1:6:45|1:6:45|This is Liu Hulan's son.
1:6:48|1:6:56|The two crouched down to examine Lao Zhao's leg injury.
1:6:56|1:7:5|Comrade Sun looked into the distance again.
1:7:5|1:7:10|The two helped Old Zhao up.
1:7:10|1:7:14|Liu Hulan and Grandfather supported Old Zhao, one on each side, as they left.
1:7:24|1:7:36|At night, [Liu Hulan] and Guifeng carefully looked around, then helped old Zhao sit down.
1:7:36|1:7:44|[Liu Hulan] laid Old Zhao's injured leg flat, helped him rewrap the bandage, and carefully wiped around the wound with a towel.
1:8:2|1:8:6|[Liu Hulan] looked ahead and the two of them helped Old Zhao up.
1:8:11|1:8:14|Upon hearing the gunshots, they quickly crouched down again.
1:8:14|1:8:22|A soldier of the Kuomintang fired a shot, then walked over to several other soldiers who were roasting and eating chicken over a fire.
1:8:22|1:8:28|[Liu Hulan] was lying on the ground, poking her head out from the bushes, when she spotted several soldiers.
1:8:28|1:8:34|[Liu Hulan] crouched down and hid, slowly crawling back.
1:8:34|1:8:37|Several soldiers noticed something unusual and put down their food.
1:8:39|1:8:52|[Liu Hulan] has retreated to the side of Guihua and Lao Zhao. She tugged at Lao Zhao's clothes, and the three of them crawled back together.
1:8:52|1:8:56|Over here, a soldier beckons, and two soldiers follow.
1:8:56|1:9:0|They ran a few steps with guns in hand, stopped to determine the direction, and then ran towards one side.
1:9:9|1:9:16|[Liu Hulan] and Guifeng helped support Old Zhao as they ran.
1:9:16|1:9:22|Hearing the noise from behind, they quickly ran to the side to hide.
1:9:22|1:9:34|Three soldiers chased after them, but they didn't see anyone and continued to search ahead.
1:9:44|1:9:56|Hearing the noise, the few of them immediately crouched down, and a few soldiers walked past them from the position above their heads.
1:9:56|1:9:58|The three of them watched the soldier's movements vigilantly.
1:10:9|1:10:15|After confirming it was safe, [Liu Hulan] sat up straight, craned her neck and looked around, there was a river not far away.
1:10:15|1:10:23|Guifahmei felt a little discouraged, [Liu Hulan] turned to look at Lao Zhao.
1:10:23|1:10:30|The two helped Old Zhao up and they walked towards the river.
1:10:30|1:10:33|[Liu Hulan] looked back and then walked to the riverside.
1:10:39|1:11:3|[Liu Hulan] carried Lao Zhao on her back, with Guihua Meizi supporting them on the side, they waded across the river and left.
1:11:3|1:11:6|Back in the village, [Liu Hulan] helps Old Zhao rebandage his wounds.
1:11:15|1:11:20|Hearing the noise, [Grandfather] excitedly tried to stand up.
1:11:20|1:11:25|Two people held down Old Zhao as Liu Hulan's mother ran over.
1:11:32|1:11:41|Liu Hulan glanced at Guihua, thought for a moment, helped Lao Zhao bandage his wounds, and then supported him with Guihua as they left.
1:11:41|1:11:50|As soon as they stepped out, they ran into [Grandfather].
1:11:50|1:11:54|The enemies were approaching in groups, and the three of them arrived at the ancient tomb outside the village.
1:11:57|1:12:20|[Liu Hulan] first peeked inside, then jumped down and carefully helped Grandfather hide inside.
1:12:20|1:12:21|The noise outside is getting louder and louder.
1:12:33|1:12:39|In the village, Liu Hulan and a Nationalist Army officer stood together, waving their hands continuously to signal the soldiers to advance.
1:12:39|1:12:45|With a nod from the officer, Liu Hulan followed closely behind him.
1:12:45|1:12:54|In the ancient tomb, hearing the gunshots, [Liu Hulan] looked worried.
1:12:54|1:12:58|[Liu Hulan] walked out, and someone called to him outside the grave. He instinctively took a step back.
1:13:5|1:13:18|He and Guifhua Sister exchanged glances and realized that they were both on the same side before crawling out.
1:13:18|1:13:22|They helped Old Zhao out, Shi Qingwang said.
1:13:33|1:13:37|Old Li carried Old Zhao on his back, while Guihua Mei led the two of them away.
1:13:37|1:13:39|[Liu Hulan] pulled Shi Xingwang over.
1:13:39|1:13:41|[Liu Hulan] appears lost in thought.
1:14:1|1:14:6|He grabbed the gun from Shi Xingwang, who gave him two grenades.
1:14:6|1:14:14|[Liu Hulan] turned and walked away, with Shi Xingwang and another sentry militiaman following him.
1:14:14|1:14:19|In the dark cellar, Liu Hulan stood with his hands tied behind his back, while someone stood guard outside the door.
1:14:25|1:14:37|Liu Hulan, Grandfather, and Liu's Mom cautiously arrived here under the starry sky.
1:14:37|1:14:47|They stared intently at the person guarding the entrance to the dark cellar.
1:14:47|1:14:49|At the appointed time, Ten Stars signaled the militia.
1:14:52|1:14:58|The two knocked down the guard, and Shi Dehui quickly ran to the door to observe the situation.
1:14:58|1:15:9|Shi Xingwang and the militiaman strangled the guard to death. They exchanged a glance, and the militiaman gestured for Shi Xingwang to go inside, while he continued to forcefully strangle the guard's neck a few more times.
1:15:9|1:15:16|Shi Xingwang entered the dark cave and helped [Liu's Father] untie the ropes first, then the two of them together helped untie the ropes for others.
1:15:23|1:15:31|Everyone speed up, untie each other's ropes, and move outward.
1:15:31|1:15:37|In the alley, [Liu Hulan], Shixingwang, and others protected Shidehui and retreated cautiously.
1:15:37|1:15:42|They were on guard against two enemy sentries not far away.
1:15:42|1:15:44|Several people hid in the dark.
1:15:50|1:16:4|Shi Xingwang gestured to not act rashly, slowly peeking out from the wall to observe. Two enemies were walking back and forth in front of a large gate, each carrying a gun.
1:16:4|1:16:15|[Liu Hulan] and Shi Dehui also poked their heads out to look, while Shi Xingwang turned around and whispered.
1:16:15|1:16:16|Shi Dehui left with some people.
1:16:20|1:16:28|An enemy fired a shot, and Shi Xingwang leaned out and shot the enemy in the chest, causing the enemy to fall down.
1:16:28|1:16:35|A large group of enemies with guns arrived, several people prepared to evacuate, [Liu Hulan] threw a grenade at them, and he and [Grandfather] covered everyone at the end.
1:16:35|1:16:41|Shi Xingwang occasionally stopped to shoot at the enemies behind him, but he ended up being seriously injured and fell down.
1:16:41|1:16:43|[Liu Hulan] went to support him, but Shi Xingwang was already unable to continue.
1:16:44|1:16:51|The enemy was about to catch up, [Liu Hulan] grabbed Shixingwang's gun and ran, jumping through the broken wall hole, with bullets hitting the wall edge.
1:16:51|1:16:54|[Liu Hulan] hides behind the wall and fires a gun, clumsily loading the chamber.
1:16:54|1:17:1|The enemy fired several shots, he quickly dodged and then fired a shot himself. After reloading, he found that there were no more bullets.
1:17:1|1:17:4|He threw away the gun and took out a grenade to throw at the enemy.
1:17:4|1:17:9|At this moment, as he turned around, he came face to face with several enemies behind him.
1:17:9|1:17:11|The enemy approached with a gun, and [Liu Hulan] took a step back.
1:17:19|1:17:30|The village was very quiet, and the strong wind lifted the soil from the ground.
1:17:30|1:17:37|In the dark dungeon, [Liu Hulan] is tied to a pillar, with his hands bound above his head, his face showing determination.
1:17:44|1:17:59|At this moment, Lv Shanqing walked in with a bamboo tray, while the Nationalist officer stood at the door. Lv Shanqing glared at Liu Hulan with a fierce look, and Liu Hulan returned the glare.
1:18:3|1:18:9|[Liu Hulan] turned her head away from him, while Lv Shanqing had one hand on his hip.
1:18:29|1:18:34|[Liu Hulan] gave him another glare.
1:18:34|1:18:39|[Liu Hulan] shows no fear.
1:18:39|1:18:42|Liu Hulan approaches him.
1:18:48|1:18:56|He held up the bamboo platform in front of [Liu Hulan] and studied her expression.
1:19:4|1:19:12|[Liu Hulan] closed her eyes, then slowly opened them, a beam of light appearing in her eyes.
1:19:12|1:19:13|It's dawn.
1:19:16|1:19:31|In the village square, the villagers gathered together, surrounded by a circle of Nationalist soldiers holding guns, their bayonets shining brightly in the sun.
1:19:31|1:19:37|The Nationalist officer walked with his hands in his pockets to the high platform, followed by [Grandfather] who stood beside him.
1:19:45|1:19:51|Some villagers ignored them, some showed disdainful expressions, and some could not hide their sadness.
1:19:51|1:19:58|[Liu's Father] and [Liu's Mom] were also standing in the crowd, with [Liu's Mom] choking back tears and [Liu's Father] lowering his head in helplessness.
1:19:58|1:20:4|Liu's Mom and Qingyun's wife exchanged a glance, staring at them with hatred, while [Grandfather] also glared at them.
1:20:12|1:20:29|In the dark cellar, a beam of light shines through the window. Two soldiers from the Nationalist Party walk in, one puts away his gun to untie the ropes on [Liu Hulan], while the other holds his gun pointed at [Liu Hulan].
1:20:29|1:20:38|The rope loosened, and [Liu Hulan] almost lost her balance. She immediately straightened up, flicked her hair back, and the Nationalist soldiers tied her hands behind her back.
1:20:41|1:20:52|Outside, the Nationalist officer waited anxiously, frowning as he glanced at his watch.
1:20:52|1:20:56|Two soldiers led [Liu Hulan] out, with a bayonet pointed at her back.
1:21:12|1:21:19|Throughout the journey, [Liu Hulan] looked at the appearance of the village, this was the place where she had lived since childhood, tears shimmered in her eyes.
1:21:34|1:21:38|Arriving at the open space, the villagers all turned to look at him, wanting to rush up to him.
1:21:38|1:21:45|Kuomintang soldiers pushed and beat the villagers, making way for a path.
1:21:45|1:21:54|[Liu Hulan] was pushed forward by a soldier, and [Grandfather] took the opportunity to rush to [Liu Hulan]'s side from the crowd.
1:21:54|1:21:55|A soldier pushes [Grandfather] to the ground.
1:21:57|1:22:1|A villager tried to help [Grandfather], but was pulled away by a soldier and thrown to the ground.
1:22:1|1:22:8|Liu's Mom, Aunt, and [Liu's Father] are all fighting against the soldiers, with Mom crying and shouting.
1:22:8|1:22:19|[Liu Hulan] watched as everyone fought against her and the soldiers of the Kuomintang.
1:22:19|1:22:22|The Nationalist officer fired two shots into the sky, and everyone stopped.
1:22:27|1:22:47|Nationalist army officer and Lv Shanqing walked down from the high platform and stood in the center of the open space.
1:22:47|1:23:4|Some people glared at him, [Liu's Mom] also looked at him with hatred, [Liu's Dad] lowered his head, Xiaoqing's mother turned her head away with tears in her eyes, [Grandfather] glanced at him sideways, some villagers looked anxious and helpless, a Kuomintang officer walked up to [Liu Hulan] and tapped his arm with a gun.
1:23:4|1:23:6|[Liu Hulan] pushed the gun away with her arm.
1:23:6|1:23:16|[Liu Hulan] turned her head away from him, the officer's smile disappeared as he locked eyes with Lv Shanqing.
1:23:16|1:23:22|He smiled and walked around to the other side of [Liu Hulan], who then turned her head.
1:23:27|1:23:33|[Liu Hulan] looked at everyone and took a few steps forward.
1:24:12|1:24:22|The officer walked over, took a step forward, and the soldier grabbed his shoulder. [Liu Hulan] shook off his hand, while not far away, the gate knife was lifted up.
1:24:22|1:24:25|[Liu Hulan] suddenly turned her head, startling the officer.
1:24:25|1:24:37|[Liu Hulan] walked towards the floodgate with a straight back and a resolute and unyielding attitude.
1:24:37|1:24:43|Under the leadership of Comrade Sun, Xiaoqing, and others, Lv Shanqing, the military officer, and his soldiers were ultimately all eliminated.
