0:3:7|0:3:14|The nun finished speaking and slightly turned her head, pulling out a sharp dagger from her sleeve and handing it to [Nie Yinniang]. [Nie Yinniang] shifted her gaze to the dagger.
0:3:14|0:3:27|Respectfully bowing, she received it with both hands, then reversed her grip on the dagger and hid it behind her back, looking towards the distant Frost Wood. Following [Nie Yinniang]'s gaze, a military unit could be seen advancing through the dense forest.
0:3:27|0:3:35|They numbered a few hundred, holding high the banners of their fiefdoms, marching mightily across the plains. The pace of the procession was not fast.
0:3:35|0:3:39|They were completely unaware of the impending danger.
0:3:39|0:3:41|[Nie Yinniang] stands with her hands behind her back.
0:3:41|0:3:49|Silently moving through the dense forest, she quickly found her prey. She stared fixedly at the target in front of her.
0:3:49|0:3:56|Silently and stealthily, [Nie Yinniang] turned a corner and followed up. The target of this assassination was the man riding a tall horse at the front.
0:3:57|0:4:5|[Nie Yinniang] rushed forward in three or two steps, wrapped her hand around the thick tree trunk, leveraged it to turn 90 degrees, and then leaped up.
0:4:5|0:4:11|Her dagger, held in a backhand grip, had already sliced across the man's neck. The warhorse remained unaware of its master's anomaly.
0:4:11|0:4:19|Continuing to walk forward at the same pace, the man maintained his previous expression but his body slowly slumped down.
0:4:19|0:4:27|Finally fell off the horse. The surroundings seemed to become noisy, yet it was as if nothing had happened. The sunlight was still bright.
0:4:27|0:4:35|Through the cracks of the leaves, the sunlight is evenly scattered in the woods, while the gentle breeze keeps blowing, causing the leaves to sway continuously. Next moment.
0:4:35|0:4:44|The camera turns to a room. A man with a beard sits in the main seat, holding a butterfly and reaching out to a young boy in front of him.
0:4:46|0:4:55|The boy was originally trying to catch a butterfly. Upon hearing the instructions, he turned his palm upwards. The man then carefully transferred the butterfly into his hand.
0:4:58|0:5:8|The boy lifted his head and stared at the butterfly intently. After glancing at the man, the boy lifted his head to search for the butterfly's figure.
0:5:9|0:5:15|The little boy's head was tilted almost ninety degrees, constantly following the flight path of the butterfly, pointing upwards.
0:5:18|0:5:23|The wet nurse squatted to the side, glanced up at the sky, and then handed a leather ball to him.
0:5:28|0:5:33|The little boy's attention was all on the butterfly and he didn't want to take the ball.
0:5:34|0:5:42|The man pointed to the leather ball in the wet nurse's hand, then reached out his hand towards the boy, who seemed to have given up his obsession with the butterfly.
0:5:42|0:5:51|He sat on the ground and played with the nursemaid. The man looked kindly at the little boy, while the boy continued to play absentmindedly.
0:5:51|0:6:4|And when the wet nurse gestured for him to roll the ball again, he suddenly became interested. He happily took a few steps back, pushed the ball towards the wet nurse with force, then took a few more steps back to increase the distance.
0:6:4|0:6:9|The two of them rolled the ball back and forth, playing happily.
0:6:9|0:6:13|The man sat cross-legged on the heated brick bed, squinting his eyes in contentment.
0:6:13|0:6:20|The corners of his mouth lifted slightly, softening even the sharp brows of Guan Yu. He watched the playing children,
0:6:20|0:6:37|While picking up peeled lychees from the nearby table and stuffing them into his mouth, little did he know that an assassin was crouching on the beam directly above him. [Nie Yinniang] quietly observed from above, waiting for the right moment to leap down.
0:6:37|0:6:45|Nie Yinniang approached the man step by step with a sharp weapon in her hand. At this moment, the man was sitting on the kang with his head tilted, already fast asleep.
0:6:45|0:6:54|Nie Yinniang quietly watched for a while with a child sleeping sweetly in her arms. Then she took two steps forward.
0:6:54|0:7:0|The man only became aware of the situation at this moment, his first reaction was to protect the child, but [Nie Yinniang] did not make a move against him.
0:7:0|0:7:9|Instead, she took a few steps back and turned to leave. The man quickly got up, carefully placed the child on the bed, and grabbed the scabbard at the edge of the bed.
0:7:9|0:7:17|Throwing the long sword at [Nie Yinniang], she seemed to have eyes on her back, deftly turning around and using a dagger to knock down the long sword.
0:7:17|0:7:24|She gave the man a glance before turning around, lifting the door curtain, walking around the screen, and leaving, leaving the man in astonishment.
0:7:24|0:7:31|In a room filled with sleeping servants. In the next moment, [Nie Yinniang] arrives at a Taoist temple, which is built against the mountain,
0:7:31|0:7:38|There is a somewhat aloof charm. The young nun is holding a big broom and sweeping the dust off the steps with great effort.
0:7:38|0:7:43|Upon seeing [Nie Yinniang] ascend the steps to the bed, she stood respectfully to the side and bowed as a gesture.
0:7:43|0:7:50|[After Nie Yinniang left, Tian Ji'an finally stood up, while Nie Yinniang never stopped walking from beginning to end. The next moment...]
0:7:50|0:8:6|She knelt with her head bowed in respect at the entrance of the main hall, silent.
0:8:11|0:8:15|[Nie Yinniang] neither responded nor argued, maintaining her original posture.
0:8:15|0:8:20|After a long time, the nun finally walked out of the main hall, swinging her whisk.
0:8:20|0:8:30|She ignored [Nie Yinniang] kneeling at the door, turning her back to her.
0:8:35|0:8:45|[Nie Yinniang] still knelt with her head down, making it impossible to see her expression. The nun seemed accustomed to her attitude, still looking calmly outside the courtyard.
0:8:45|0:8:51|At this moment, our film's assassin [Nie Yinniang] officially begins. Feudal lords ruling independently,
0:8:51|0:8:59|The Tang Dynasty emperor was transformed into the Zhou Dynasty king, with actual control only over a small area around Chang'an. So it started from Emperor Dezong of Tang.
0:8:59|0:9:7|Successive emperors of the Tang Dynasty have always tried to weaken the power of regional warlords and restore central authority. The son of Emperor Tang Daizong, Tang Dezong,
0:9:7|0:9:15|The large-scale attack on the three towns of the Hebei region ended in complete failure. This campaign not only failed to eliminate the three towns,
0:9:15|0:9:23|Instead, the armies that the court used to suppress the rebels also mutinied. In the end, Emperor Tang Dezong had to issue a self-blaming edict.
0:9:23|0:9:30|Emperor Tang Dezong, whose ambitions were unfulfilled, died in melancholy, and his son, Emperor Tang Shunzong, was also in poor health.
0:9:30|0:9:37|He abdicated after one year on the throne. But in the generation of his grandson, Emperor Xianzong of Tang, he was ambitious.
0:9:37|0:9:39|The struggle against the local authorities must continue.
0:9:39|0:9:47|[Nie Yinniang]'s father [Nie Feng] is a veteran general of Weibo, former commander of the Imperial Guards, and current Duke of the Capital.
0:9:47|0:9:58|The camera then shifts to a luxurious residence, where [Tian Jing], a gentle and elegant lady with a plum blossom mark on her forehead, is sitting on a couch adjusting her earrings, with a maid standing behind her.
0:9:58|0:10:6|Focused on inserting the golden hairpin into Madam's elaborate hair bun, silently arranging all the hair ornaments.
0:10:6|0:10:14|Taking the tray from the maid, [Nie Yinniang] stood quietly behind the lady. Suddenly, the lady turned her head and glanced towards the door.
0:10:14|0:10:18|Then she inverted the bronze mirror in her hand onto the table.
0:10:22|0:10:30|Madam seemed somewhat surprised by the news, abruptly retracting her hand that was fiddling with the jewelry.
0:10:30|0:10:37|Involuntarily, [Nie Yinniang] sat up straight in the main hall, with her eyes lowered and holding a dusting cloth while sitting on the kang.
0:10:37|0:10:42|[Nie Yinniang] stood quietly with her head bowed. The curtain on her right side swayed with the wind.
0:10:42|0:10:51|Through the crack, a group of people can be seen hurrying by. [The nun] glanced slightly and then sat up straight after recognizing the approaching individuals.
0:10:51|0:11:0|The former lady stood in front of [the nun], bowing with both hands. Surprisingly, this [nun] turned out to be a princess.
0:11:2|0:11:15|The nun stood up and helped the lady up from the ground. After saying that, the nun nodded slightly.
0:11:15|0:11:20|After bowing to Madam, she walked out without looking back. Madam frowned slightly.
0:11:20|0:11:26|Glancing at [Nie Yinniang], he quickly turned around and followed the nun to escort her out.
0:11:26|0:11:34|This nun is Princess Jiaxin, the twin sister of Princess Jiacheng. Thirteen years ago, she took away Nie Feng's daughter, Nie Yinniang.
0:11:34|0:11:42|And trained her to become an unparalleled assassin. Now she has come to return to [Nie Tian Shi] and take her childhood sweetheart and cousin [Nie Yinniang].
0:11:42|0:11:47|The life of Tian Ji'an, the lord of Weibo. Watching his daughter finally return home,
0:11:47|0:11:53|[Mrs. Nie] was overwhelmed with emotions and had already sent someone to assist her daughter in preparing the bath water. Following the maid's instructions,
0:11:53|0:12:1|Hot water was poured from one bucket after another into the exquisite bathtub. Then a maid walked in carrying a tray.
0:12:1|0:12:7|Various precious medicinal herbs are evenly spread on the water surface. Then, a group of people follow.
0:12:7|0:12:15|Water was poured into the bathtub, and as the servant poured the water, she picked up some root-like medicinal herbs and placed them in the bathtub in an orderly manner.
0:12:15|0:12:23|The maid watched attentively as the nanny finished sprinkling, then skillfully took the small plate and handed over the next batch of medicinal herbs.
0:12:23|0:12:31|The nanny took the herbs, grabbed a small handful, carefully smelled it, confirmed it was correct, and then continued to sprinkle it into the bathtub.
0:12:31|0:12:35|The weather was clear and sunny in the wilderness at this time, with a gentle breeze, as far as the eye could see,
0:12:35|0:12:39|A small tree with a trunk as thick as an arm stands alone on the grassland. In the distance
0:12:39|0:12:46|A group of horsemen rode through the woods, slowly trotting on the grassy field, each person on horseback dressed in elaborate attire.
0:12:46|0:12:53|The identities are extraordinary. The men in front and behind the horse team are not smiling, dressed in discreet military official attire.
0:12:53|0:12:58|Vigilantly observing the surroundings. In the center of the horse team is a woman, [Nie Yinniang].
0:12:58|0:13:3|She sat alone on the horse, her hair ornaments and attire more noble compared to others.
0:13:3|0:13:7|Even the horses beneath them were adorned with pearl decorations. At this moment, [Tian Ji'an]...
0:13:7|0:13:22|[Nie Yinniang] sat naked in the prepared bathtub, with herbal residue still clinging to her smooth shoulders and tears clearly visible on her face. She hugged her knees tightly with her arms, her eyes filled with an unprecedented sense of confusion.
0:13:22|0:13:31|A remarkable woman sits under an ancient tree, cradling a Nine Heavens Jade Lute in her arms. She lightly touches her forehead with a plum blossom.
0:13:31|0:13:38|Her hair is styled high, with hair accessories that are not elaborate but made of imperial gold. Her attire is also far from ordinary.
0:13:38|0:13:46|The delicate silk robe, embroidered with intricate peony patterns, was as thin as cicada wings, with the folds revealing the unique sheen of silk.
0:13:46|0:13:58|What is most striking is the woman's appearance, which bears a striking resemblance to a nun. She is Princess Jiacheng, the sister of Emperor Tang Dezong, and the twin sister of the nun Princess Jiaxin.
0:13:58|0:14:4|The ambitious military governor Tian Ji'an in Weibo Town is the adopted son of Princess Jiacheng.
0:14:4|0:14:18|Princess Jiacheng's marriage to Tian Xuxian back then was clearly a political mission. Not only did she groom Tian Xing, Tian Ji'an's uncle, as the commander of the Imperial Guards, but she also adopted Tian Ji'an, who was born to a lowly mother, as her foster son.
0:14:18|0:14:23|Deliberately cultivated to become Tian Xu's successor. However, due to Emperor Tang Dezong,
0:14:23|0:14:44|The Emperor's nephew, Tang Shunzong, passed away within a year, followed shortly by the Princess Jia Cheng who died of grief. At this moment, her delicate jade hand lightly plucks the strings of the qin.
0:14:52|0:14:58|The fingertips are like swords and spears, powerful and resounding, in stark contrast to the sweet face.
0:15:14|0:15:20|There is a sense of loneliness and desolation as Princess Nie Yinniang kneels in the courtyard, silent for a long time. At this moment,
0:15:20|0:15:28|The maids are dressing [Nie Yinniang] in an outer garment embroidered with auspicious cloud patterns, with a silk short jacket and a long skirt underneath.
0:15:28|0:15:45|And she stood there expressionless like a puppet on a string. The nanny stood in front of [Nie Yinniang], earnestly explaining.
0:15:45|0:15:50|And [Nie Yinniang] didn't even bother to lift her eyelids after hearing this. It took her a long time before she blinked.
0:15:50|0:15:59|She revealed a hint of elusive contemplation. Suddenly she took a few steps forward, lowered her brows and stood still, remaining silent, even when dressed in women's clothing and a flowing skirt.
0:15:59|0:16:7|She still exuded a layer of melancholy, with the maidservants standing quietly behind her as she changed clothes, no one dared to make a move.
0:16:7|0:16:14|Even the old nanny dared not speak easily. [Nie Yinniang] and her cousin [Tian Ji'an] grew up together, innocent and carefree, but
0:16:14|0:16:21|The princess's decision disrupted [Nie Yinniang]'s once beautiful life, returning home to find everything changed.
0:16:21|0:16:24|She became the sharpest claw of the court,
0:16:24|0:16:32|Cousin Tian Ji'an is the enemy most feared by the court, the scene of Princess Jiacheng playing the zither under the tree is still vivid. Perhaps at that time.
0:16:32|0:16:41|She had already anticipated the outcome for these two individuals. For Princess Jiacheng, on one side was her own flesh and blood brother, on the other side was a political marriage she had no choice but to accept.
0:16:41|0:16:49|A husband with a sinister heart and a stepson who lacks loyalty, the balance in her heart can easily tilt to the other side without hesitation.
0:16:49|0:16:57|However, decades of intrigue and scheming had already worn her out, her life was like a story of dancing with a green cherry blossom mirror.
0:16:57|0:17:6|This is a war without gunpowder. At this moment, [Nie Tian Shi] has already regained her former gentleness, sitting in the main seat of the hall, looking out the door.
0:17:7|0:17:13|There was a faint smile on his face, and the table was already set with exquisite pastries and fruits.
0:17:13|0:17:21|The nanny pushed aside the curtains and entered the main hall, followed by [Nie Yinniang], who had changed back into her sharp assassin attire. With her guidance,
0:17:21|0:17:34|[Nie Yinniang] came to the right side of the main hall and knelt down in front of a kind old lady. [Old Lady Nie] stopped eating her porridge.
0:17:34|0:17:43|She held a bowl in one hand and gestured to [Nie Yinniang] to stand up with the other hand. Meanwhile, [Nie Tian Shi] noticed that his daughter had already entered the main hall.
0:17:43|0:17:45|He couldn't help but look cautiously
0:17:45|0:17:50|In the past. In her gaze towards [Nie Yinniang], apart from the unique anticipation of a mother for her child,
0:17:50|0:17:58|There was even a hint of tension mixed in. After paying respects to the old lady, [Nie Yinniang] walked towards [Nie Tian Shi] and sat down on her other side.
0:17:58|0:18:5|But after [Nie Yinniang] sat down, [Nie Tian Shi] seemed hesitant to speak. She picked up the embroidered pouch on the table.
0:18:5|0:18:16|Gently placed in front of [Nie Yinniang]'s desk. [Nie Tian Shi] withdrew her hand and quietly gazed at [Nie Yinniang]'s face.
0:18:16|0:18:30|However, [Nie Yinniang] did not respond. She expressionlessly reached out to take the embroidered pouch on the table. [Madame Nie] let out a sigh and lowered her eyes. [Nie Yinniang] opened the pouch and took out a not very delicate jade ornament from inside.
0:18:42|0:18:51|[Nie Yinniang] held the jade pendant in her hands, gently rubbing it, restraining her emotions with hidden patience.
0:19:9|0:19:28|[Mrs. Nie] cautiously raised her eyes to look at [Nie Yinniang], and after seeing [Nie Yinniang]'s expression, [Mrs. Nie] lowered her eyes again, with a hint of helplessness and emotion in her expression.
0:19:36|0:19:44|The golden root carriage is drawn by six dragons to rule the world, and it is the emperor's vehicle for travel.
0:20:24|0:20:30|[Mrs. Nie] quickly suppressed her emotions and looked at [Nie Yinniang] with a hint of earnestness in her eyes, while [Nie Yinniang] remained silent for a long time.
0:20:50|0:21:16|Mrs. Nie referred to the Sixth Master as Tian Ji'an, and they made a marriage agreement at that time.
0:21:38|0:21:42|[Mrs. Nie] at this moment, had already slightly tilted her head back, tears shimmering in her eyes.
0:21:42|0:21:55|[Madame Nie] still worked hard to keep them from falling.
0:21:55|0:22:5|Resting his arm on the table, he leaned slightly towards [Nie Yinniang]. After she repeated the sentence, she remained motionless in her original posture.
0:22:5|0:22:10|Without even looking up at [Nie Yinniang], she covered her face with the unfolded embroidery pouch.
0:22:10|0:22:16|She silently endured the pain and wept, even in front of her own mother, unwilling to lose control like this. However
0:22:16|0:22:20|The enmity of 13 years cannot be hidden in the heart forever.
0:22:20|0:22:31|Although the princess truly adores [Nie Yinniang], she was not able to rely on her parents since childhood, and it was also the princess who severed the bond between her and her childhood sweetheart.
0:22:31|0:22:42|Now that she has completed her training, being heartless and breaking loyalty is not enough, assassinating the general is still not enough. The purpose of being sent back is for her to kill her beloved. And at this moment, Tian Ji'an is in a different state.
0:25:20|0:25:25|This made the Weibo military governor very unhappy with [Tian Ji'an].
0:25:25|0:25:32|He picked up the jade object at hand, his anger soaring as he threw it down the steps, then leaped up from the collapsed table.
0:25:32|0:25:38|The gaze fixed on [Tian Xing] was filled with gloom. [Tian Ji'an] could be seen pacing back and forth on the stage.
0:25:38|0:25:47|He leaned against the small pillow on the bed just straightened. He scanned the hall aimlessly and once again fixed his gaze on [Tian Xing].
0:25:47|0:25:56|[Tian Ji'an] sat beside his eldest son, seemingly accustomed to his father's violent temper. But at this moment, [Tian Xing] was extremely angry.
0:25:56|0:26:3|He turned his head to look at the ground, his brows furrowed tightly, looking sulky in contrast.
0:26:3|0:26:9|Sitting on the right, [Nie Feng] appeared much calmer. He sat upright at the desk without changing his expression.
0:26:9|0:26:15|Staring intently ahead, unaware that there is still someone in the council hall of the Governor's Mansion.
0:26:15|0:26:21|She was quietly observing the movements below, only to see [Nie Yinniang] crouching silently on the beam.
0:26:21|0:26:30|With a cold and frosty expression, [Nie Yinniang] stared fixedly at a spot, her gaze not shifting for a long time. The camera then shifted.
0:26:30|0:26:43|At this moment, [Tian Ji'an] is standing in the study, teaching his eldest son hand-to-hand combat techniques. Following [Tian Ji'an]'s instructions, the eldest son successfully brings him down to the ground. [Tian Ji'an] then gets up again and continues to demonstrate the moves.
0:26:43|0:26:49|He reached out his hands and grasped his son's arm, signaling him to break free. After the son's first unsuccessful attempt,
0:26:49|0:26:58|[Tian Ji'an] let go and took two steps back, reaching out again to grab him. But this time his son acted first and didn't wait for [Tian Ji'an] to catch him.
0:26:58|0:27:5|Just like a brute, he embraced his waist and tackled him to the ground. [Tian Ji'an] stood up, smiling, and lifted his son, spinning around.
0:27:5|0:27:14|He indulgently patted his bottom before letting him go. His son looked at Tian Ji'an, exhausted but with a smile on his face.
0:27:14|0:27:30|The sun was shining outside, and a man in a black cloak walked out of the hall, walked along the corridor to the end, turned a corner and disappeared. This man is [Tian Ji'an]'s personal bodyguard [Xia Jing]. Not long after, footsteps sounded again, and [Xia Jing] returned.
0:28:50|0:28:56|Nie Yinniang, at the edge of the nearby woods, decisively kicked a soldier to the ground.
0:28:56|0:29:4|She leaped lightly onto the nearby pavilion. Then she reached back and grabbed the soldier next to her, using the hand holding the long sword to knock his weapon away.
0:29:4|0:29:7|He threw him off the pavilion again.
0:29:7|0:29:15|Nie Yinniang fought with several soldiers and retreated into the woods, with the soldiers closely following.
0:29:15|0:29:23|[Nie Tian Shi] brought the three children back to the room. The eldest son played with a ball on his own, while the two younger sons sat obediently on the side.
0:29:23|0:29:32|Holding a bowl of snacks and eating happily. The boss immediately put away his playful attitude and stood obediently aside. [Nie Tian Shi] also withdrew her thoughts.
0:29:32|0:29:41|Standing up elegantly with her skirt held up, she waited for the master to enter. At this moment, [Tian Ji'an] walked into the room with his sword in hand and stood in front of [Nie Tian Shi].
0:29:43|0:29:53|[Tian Ji'an] appeared extremely impatient upon hearing these words.
0:29:53|0:29:58|He frowned and glanced outside the room, then walked straight to the other side of the couch.
0:29:58|0:30:6|Swinging the sword on his back, he sat down again. The woman saw him sit down and stopped speaking, then returned to the edge of the bed.
0:30:6|0:30:12|She leaned slightly against the other side. She seemed to be accustomed to [Tian Ji'an] using this attitude, so she was not angry.
0:30:12|0:30:20|At this moment, two children sat quietly between their parents holding bowls, paying no attention to the thoughts of the two adults. The sun was shining brightly outdoors.
0:30:20|0:30:24|But the atmosphere in the forest was unusually eerie, as she looked up and gazed ahead,
0:30:24|0:30:30|Under the shade of the trees blocking most of the view, the backlit leaves appeared dark and oppressive. Standing under the trees was a woman, [Nie Yinniang].
0:31:5|0:31:13|Gazing intently, her gentle eyes seemed to be looking at a lover. After a while, she lowered her hand.
0:31:13|0:31:20|Turning around a ancient tree, the gaze fixed on the building not far away, which was the residence of [Tian Ji'an].
0:31:20|0:31:36|The night was deep, and the moonlight sketched a trace of the distant mountains. A magnificent residence, resembling a palace, was hidden in the darkness. Only a faint light emanated from the corners of the roof, indicating that there were still people inside.
0:31:36|0:31:42|And two servants parked the cart full of firewood on the side, lighting the braziers in the courtyard.
0:31:42|0:31:50|Suddenly, two galloping horses passed by. The person on the horseback was [Nie Tian Shi] and her entourage. [Nie Tian Shi] on horseback was serious and unsmiling.
0:31:50|0:31:57|With tightly closed lips and eyes fixed straight ahead, the immense landscape painting screen at the door ensures privacy indoors at this moment.
0:31:57|0:32:5|A physician squatted by the bed with a serious expression. General [Nie Feng] stood quietly beside, his sword hanging by his side, showing no emotions.
0:32:5|0:32:11|Soon, [Nie Tian Shi] was led into the inner room by the servant, and General [Nie Feng] then came to his senses and greeted her.
0:32:26|0:32:34|[Nie Tian Shi] heard this, sighed silently, her hand that was originally raised weakly fell to the sides, but soon she collected her emotions.
0:32:34|0:32:49|Nie Tian Shi adjusted her expression and looked towards General Tian Ji'an. With a melancholic look, she barely nodded at General Nie Feng. At that moment,
0:32:49|0:32:51|The two looked at each other in silence. At this moment,
0:32:51|0:32:58|Nie Tian Shi's elder brother Tian Xing lay on the couch with his eyes tightly closed, completely unaware, only the slight rise and fall of his body when breathing.
0:32:58|0:33:6|Reminding those in the room that he was still alive. The physician had obviously been treating him for a long time, as seen from the outer side of his right arm.
0:33:6|0:33:14|The silver needles were already inserted. The physician then selected from the assistant's cloth bundle, picked up another needle, and bent down again.
0:33:14|0:33:23|Pressing into the left arm of [Tian Xing], the physician slowly twisted the silver needle in his hand, carefully observing [Tian Xing]'s facial expression.
0:33:23|0:33:31|Not until Tian Xing's eyelids trembled slightly did he release his hand and went to pick another needle on the other arm. Tian Xing's wife stood beside the physician.
0:33:31|0:33:39|Nie Yinniang stood quietly next to Nie Tian Shi, watching her brother calmly. Tian Ji'an did not take another step forward, staring at the scene intently.
0:33:39|0:33:46|Instead, facing [Nie Yinniang] standing in the distance, his weathered face was filled with worries about his wife.
0:33:46|0:33:47|At this moment, 
0:33:47|0:33:54|In another equally magnificent residence, the candlelight also illuminated the gifts brightly. The thin gauze curtains
0:33:54|0:34:2|The layers of curtains swayed around the room. Through the gauze, a woman in plain clothes could be seen inside.
0:34:2|0:34:5|She sat with a melancholy expression, propping up the collapsed edge with one hand.
0:34:5|0:34:13|It seems like all the weight of her body is leaning on that arm. This is Hu Ji, the favored concubine of Tian Ji'an. As a wife with no background,
0:34:13|0:34:21|Hu Ji had no power to compete with [Nie Tian Shi] for favor, so she could only wait quietly in her own room. Over time,
0:34:21|0:34:28|Passing the long waiting time has also become a new pleasure. At this moment, she stared straight ahead at the patterns without looking away.
0:34:28|0:34:35|The eyes had not blinked for a long time, only the left hand unconsciously rubbing the hem of the garment, revealing the inner unrest.
0:34:36|0:34:44|Not until the servant's report did she become alert, hastily sitting up and looking towards the outside of the room. Her head twisted along with the figure outside.
0:34:44|0:34:47|Fully exposed the inner longing and joy.
0:34:47|0:34:56|Upon hearing footsteps approaching, [Hu Ji] quickly got up and went forward to greet the newcomer, only to see [Tian Ji'an] holding a long sword in his hand, dressed in a plain silk ceremonial robe.
0:34:56|0:35:2|He walked in with a cold face. He stood by the bed and looked around, then threw the long sword in his hand onto the bed.
0:35:2|0:35:8|Sitting down, Tian Ji'an swings his robe and steps on the footrest. He props his chin with his right hand, staring straight ahead.
0:35:8|0:35:16|It seemed that the foul words had not yet been spoken. [Hu Ji] obediently followed behind him, smiling and nodding to the maidservant beside him. The maidservant, seeing this,
0:35:16|0:35:23|He immediately walked to [Hu Ji] with a tray, from which [Hu Ji] took out a small exquisite golden wine flask.
0:35:23|0:35:30|Hands were held out to Tian Ji'an. Tian Ji'an turned his head and took the wine bottle, holding it near his mouth without drinking for a long time. After a while,
0:35:30|0:35:37|He absentmindedly blew on the surface, took a small sip. He held the wine flask in front of him and pondered for a long time.
0:35:37|0:35:45|Having just finished the remaining wine in one gulp, he impatiently handed the wine bottle to [Hu Ji]. [Hu Ji] placed the wine bottle back on the tray.
0:35:45|0:35:51|The maid gestured for [Tian Ji'an] to leave. After seeing him remain indifferent for a long time,
0:35:51|0:35:59|[Hu Ji] turned around and gently climbed onto [Tian Ji'an]'s shoulder, resting her cheek against it and softly spoke.
0:36:1|0:36:8|Hu Ji finished speaking and looked at Tian Ji'an's face with a cute tilt of her head, quietly trying to figure out his thoughts. Tian Ji'an heard her words,
0:36:8|0:36:12|The gloom on her face deepened a few shades.
0:36:14|0:36:21|Hu Ji heard this with a hint of surprise, sitting up straight instead of leaning against Tian Ji'an, and looked at him seriously.
0:36:27|0:36:32|Facing this uncle [Tian Ji'an] full of resentment, the old generals did not regard the young military governor with much respect.
0:36:32|0:36:37|Instead, he admired [Tian Xing] even more. Therefore, he could only roar loudly.
0:36:37|0:36:45|Exile [Tian Xing] demonstrates his authority. But now, as the commander of the Imperial Guards, [Tian Xing] also commands respect within the army.
0:36:45|0:36:50|[Tian Ji'an] is not someone who can be easily dealt with. [Hu Ji] is powerless in this matter.
0:36:50|0:36:55|She once again nestled up to [Tian Ji'an]. However, what they did not know was,
0:36:55|0:37:1|At this moment, a person quietly approached the outside of the gauze curtain. Standing there, observing [Tian Ji'an].
0:37:1|0:37:9|After doting on his concubine for a long time, Tian Ji'an finally lowered his head and placed an exquisite embroidered pouch on the table beside him. When she looked up again,
0:37:9|0:37:16|Her eyes exuded a chilling aura as she disregarded the surroundings and lifted the veil in front of her, taking a few steps forward.
0:37:16|0:37:23|Faced with the embrace of his childhood sweetheart and a stranger, [Nie Yinniang] couldn't explain the feelings in her heart at all.
0:37:23|0:37:32|[Tian Ji'an], still immersed in his own emotions, did not notice the presence of [Nie Yinniang]. Instead, it was [Hu Ji] who saw [Nie Yinniang] standing not far away.
0:37:33|0:37:41|[Tian Ji'an], sensing something amiss with [Hu Ji], finally opened his eyes. At the sight of [Nie Yinniang], he shouted angrily and grabbed his sword, charging out.
0:37:41|0:37:49|The two soon disappeared into the room, and it was a long time before [Hu Ji] got up, looking thoughtfully outside. In the candlelight,
0:37:49|0:37:58|Nie Yinniang's embroidered pouch left behind was particularly eye-catching. Tian Ji'an's martial arts skills were not bad, but Nie Yinniang was even better. Just then, she raised her sword,
0:37:58|0:38:7|Lightly flipping over several eaves and landing on a sloping roof, [Nie Yinniang] had long been standing here, quietly looking at the person in front of her.
0:38:7|0:38:15|[Tian Ji'an] suddenly raised his sword and struck forward. Faced with Tian Ji'an's attack, [Nie Yinniang] did not fight back, but calmly retreated to avoid it.
0:38:15|0:38:25|And [Tian Ji'an], missing his strike, was instead pushed back, feeling greatly annoyed. He turned around, raised his sword again, and charged forward unwilling to show weakness.
0:38:25|0:38:32|[Nie Yinniang] may be empty-handed, but she easily catches [Tian Ji'an]'s moves. This time, she no longer just defends herself,
0:38:32|0:38:42|Instead of grabbing the hand holding the sword of [Tian Ji'an], she punched him, making him take several steps forward. But [Tian Ji'an] didn't seem to give up easily, raising his sword again and striking forward.
0:38:42|0:38:50|Nie Yinniang effortlessly stopped Tian Ji'an's move with a casual hand, then kicked him in the chest.
0:38:50|0:38:56|Tian Ji'an staggered back several steps. Then Tian Ji'an stood up, holding his chest in pain.
0:38:56|0:39:1|Still glaring angrily, [Nie Yinniang] advanced with her sword. However, she showed no desire for battle.
0:39:1|0:39:9|She turned around gracefully, leaped off the roof and disappeared. [Tian Ji'an] rubbed his chest and stared at the figure in a daze.
0:39:9|0:39:16|But the assassin's silent visit, defeating himself and then retreating, was enough to make [Tian Ji'an] tremble with fear.
0:39:16|0:39:17|In the next moment,
0:39:17|0:39:30|He deployed his troops and sent his trusted general [Xia Jing] to investigate the assassin. [Xia Jing] never delayed in carrying out orders from [Tian Ji'an], and he continued to patrol the streets with his sword in hand. [Xia Jing] carefully observed the streets.
0:39:30|0:39:38|The traces on both sides of the alley suddenly changed their expression and rushed towards the opposite alley with a sword in hand. At this moment, [Hu Ji] was pacing anxiously in the room.
0:39:38|0:39:44|She held the embroidered pouch left by [Nie Yinniang], looking worriedly and occasionally glancing towards the door.
0:39:44|0:39:50|[Tian Ji'an] has not returned yet, causing [Hu Ji] to be extremely anxious. Upon sensing someone entering the door,
0:39:50|0:39:56|[Hu Ji] hurriedly took small steps to greet him. Upon seeing that [Tian Ji'an] was safe and sound,
0:39:56|0:40:9|Hu Ji threw herself into his arms, Tian Ji'an embraced her, then he walked to the table, picked up the scabbard on the couch, inserted the sword into it, and threw it aside. With a flick of his sleeve, he sat down coldly.
0:40:9|0:40:14|Roaming aimlessly around. [Hu Ji] sat beside [Tian Ji'an],
0:40:14|0:40:19|Seeing his worried expression, she handed the embroidered pouch and jade pendant to him.
0:40:19|0:40:28|[Tian Ji'an] looked incredulously, took a long look before suddenly realizing, and hurriedly pulled out a similar jade ornament from his waist.
0:40:31|0:40:39|[Tian Ji'an] showed a rare moment of fleeting regret on his face. After a while, he seemed to sense the puzzled look from [Hu Ji].
0:40:39|0:40:50|He once again put the two jade pendants together to signal to him.
0:41:0|0:41:10|It seems that every move of the assassin can be explained, such as her silently sneaking into the mansion, just to leave behind this jade pendant.
0:41:10|0:41:18|After Tian Ji'an chased her out, she clearly had the strength to overpower him but still did not strike to kill. In fact, Nie Yinniang's purpose is very simple,
0:41:18|0:41:26|She just wanted [Tian Ji'an] to recognize her. Only by cutting off the past emotions, can [Nie Yinniang] regain her identity as an assassin.
0:41:26|0:41:37|While Tian Ji'an was reminiscing about the past while polishing the jade pendant, Nie Yinniang once again silently sneaked into the room.
0:42:12|0:42:16|Tian Ji'an's legal wife, Tian Yuanshi, is the daughter of the governor of Mingzhou, Yuan Yi.
0:42:20|0:42:30|For political reasons, [Tian Xufu and his wife] decided to let their youngest son [Tian Ji'an]
0:42:30|0:42:37|Married into the Yuan family. This made it difficult for [Tian Ji'an], who had been childhood sweethearts with [Nie Yinniang], to accept. Thirteen years have passed,
0:42:37|0:42:52|Nie Yinniang now listens calmly as Tian Ji'an recalls the past.
0:43:2|0:43:9|[Tian Ji'an] seems to be nostalgic, he knows why the former Yao Qi would break into the Yuan family's yard back then.
0:43:14|0:43:21|[Tian Ji'an] remained motionless, as if lost in his own thoughts. At this point, [Nie Yinniang] also understood the meaning behind the princess's words from years ago.
0:43:21|0:43:25|The meaning of the song. She first presented the jade pendant to the two of them to form a marriage bond.
0:43:25|0:43:38|After being abandoned for a political marriage, [Nie Yinniang] was given to [Tian Ji'an] in marriage, and the inexperienced [Nie Yinniang] was seriously injured by the people of the Yuan family. To protect her, the Princess had no choice but to take her away.
0:43:40|0:43:47|Hearing about her husband's past with his childhood sweetheart, [Hu Ji] did not feel jealous, but instead sympathized with [Nie Yinniang]. Just a child of a dozen years old,
0:43:47|0:43:55|How could one know the earth-shattering destiny that awaits them? At this moment, even [Hu Ji] is unaware of her own fate, and will also be affected by this unintentional defense.
0:43:55|0:44:21|There is a shift in [Tian Ji'an]'s demeanor as he seeks some illusory comfort, he takes the initiative to embrace [Hu Ji] and rests his chin on her shoulder, with [Hu Ji] leaning into his embrace.
0:44:32|0:44:41|[Tian Ji'an] holds [Hu Ji]'s hand, seemingly trying to find a trace of the past [Nie Yinniang] through her.
0:44:45|0:44:51|As Tian Ji'an recalls, the image of Nie Yinniang becomes clearer and clearer.
0:44:51|0:44:57|The long-forgotten moonlight in the heart seems to shine again. These things have been weighing on the heart for many years.
0:44:57|0:45:5|I thought I had already forgotten, but today I realized that the things engraved in my heart will be remembered for a lifetime. The watchful subordinates,
0:45:5|0:45:12|The ambitious person by his side has never let Tian Ji'an rest easy for so many years. Only with Hu Ji...
0:45:12|0:45:19|He could only relax for a moment, as [Nie Yinniang] stood in a corner of the inner room, calmly listening to her cousin recounting stories of the past.
0:45:19|0:45:26|Her cold expression seemed to relax. At this moment, [Nie Yinniang] no longer looked at [Tian Ji'an] as if he were prey.
0:45:26|0:45:37|Her gaze drifted blankly in the air, seemingly immersed in this memory. Perhaps at this moment, that indomitable command had also left a crack in her heart.
0:45:37|0:45:40|At this moment, [Nie Feng] sat with his feet on the footrest in the main hall.
0:45:40|0:45:47|Leaning on the bed with one hand and resting his head on his elbow, he sighed silently and then continued to stare blankly. [Madame Nie] stood behind him.
0:45:47|0:45:56|Separated from him by only a thin veil, [Nie Feng] as the third in command of Weibo, is also the uncle of [Tian Ji'an]. Suddenly, a series of footsteps disrupted his thoughts.
0:45:56|0:46:2|The old steward of the [Nie Family] walked in slowly.
0:46:5|0:46:11|The old steward turned his head and gestured to the side, then left leaning on his crutch. A dusty soldier walked in.
0:46:22|0:46:29|[Mrs. Nie] could no longer contain her inner anxiety, she lifted the gauze and walked into the main hall, while [Nie Feng] forced himself to stay alert and waved his hand.
0:46:31|0:46:36|The soldier respectfully bowed to [Nie Feng] and hurriedly left. [Mrs. Nie] quickly took a few steps forward.
0:46:36|0:46:45|Standing in front of [Nie Feng], we see him gritting his teeth and slapping his thigh in frustration. At this moment,
0:46:45|0:46:55|[Nie Tian Shi] and her husband both knew who this assassin was. At that time, [Nie Yinniang] had intruded into the Marquis' residence without permission.
0:46:55|0:46:59|If it weren't for the nun taking the princess away, he would have been seriously injured.
0:47:6|0:47:13|[Nie Feng] approached [Madame Nie] with a gaze as sharp as a torch, mixed with some anger and resentment towards the princess.
0:47:13|0:47:21|Madame Nie slowly raised her head upon hearing these words, looking directly into Nie Feng's eyes. Neither of them spoke, only exchanging a glance filled with meaning.
0:47:21|0:47:28|Nie Feng already understood the Lady's intentions. After all, this was an order personally issued by the Princess, and they were powerless to resist. Suddenly
0:47:28|0:47:37|The old steward stood at the door once again, bowing respectfully.
0:47:38|0:47:44|Lady Nie, after hearing the report, met General Tian Ji'an's gaze once again.
0:47:44|0:47:58|The two looked at each other in silence once again. At this moment, [Tian Ji'an] hurriedly invited him, what was his purpose? Both of them already knew it in their hearts, and [General Nie] also had his own reasons, he had to enter the mansion because he needed to stop his daughter.
0:47:58|0:48:12|At this moment, [Nie Yinniang] has returned to her residence. She quietly enters the room without disturbing the maid who is already asleep by the bed. Obviously, with the skills of [Xia Jing], [Nie Yinniang] can easily shake him off.
0:48:12|0:48:28|However, even when she returned to her own home, [Nie Yinniang] showed no warmth in her eyes. She stood motionless in the center of the room, furrowing her brow as if listening to the sounds outside. Perhaps every word of the conversation between [Nie Tian Shi] and his wife had fallen perfectly into [Nie Yinniang]'s ears.
0:48:28|0:48:37|At five in the morning, the drum sounded, and [Tian Ji'an] was already waiting in the hall. The disturbance of the assassin kept him awake all night, his face looking very unpleasant.
0:48:37|0:48:47|Soon, Nie Feng arrived and Xia Jing greeted him at the door, respectfully leading him to Tian Ji'an.
0:49:8|0:49:16|After receiving the token, [Tian Ji'an] flicked his sleeve and cast a scrutinizing glance at [Nie Feng]. [Nie Feng] paid no attention to the token handed to him by [Xia Jing], maintaining a poker face.
0:49:22|0:49:32|[Xia Jing] hesitated upon hearing this and withdrew his hand. Upon receiving the answer, [Nie Feng] immediately reached out his hand, and [Xia Jing] then placed the token into his hand.
0:49:36|0:49:43|[Nie Feng] took the token and turned to leave, [Tian Ji'an] spoke again, a look of surprise on [Nie Feng]'s face as he turned back to look at him.
0:49:53|0:49:58|Let Tian Ji'an no longer disguise himself with a high and mighty, keep-away-from-strangers expression.
0:49:58|0:50:8|[Nie Feng] held the token in one hand and gripped the sword in the other, walking firmly to stand in front of [Tian Ji'an].
0:50:10|0:50:12|[Tian Ji'an] knew that his uncle was reminding him. Just the thought of it,
0:50:12|0:50:20|[Tian Ji'an] showed a hint of indescribable smile on his face. He stood up and took a few steps forward, smiling at [Nie Feng]. As clever as [Nie Feng],
0:50:22|0:50:36|Tian Ji'an immediately understood the meaning behind Nie Feng's words. He looked up at his nephew for a long time, then arched his hand and walked away without looking back. Xia Jing's gaze followed Nie Feng's figure until he walked out of the main hall.
0:50:36|0:50:43|Having just bowed to Tian Ji'an, Nie Yinniang followed them out. Tian Ji'an calmly turned his head to watch the two leave.
0:50:43|0:50:50|A subtle and elusive expression appeared on her face. She trusts her husband's abilities, yet this matter seems beyond her control. At this moment, [Tian Ji'an],
0:50:50|0:51:5|[Tian Xing] did not rest either. She sat in front of the dressing table with exquisite makeup. Her maid picked up a palm-sized flower-shaped hairpin and carefully inserted it into her high bun. As the maid moved, [Tian Xing] blinked slightly.
0:51:5|0:51:12|The expression remained unchanged. Suddenly, a door slammed, breaking the tranquility inside the room. [Tian Xing] lowered his eyes slightly upon hearing the sound.
0:51:12|0:51:34|It seems that the arrival of the person was expected. A sly-looking man bowed respectfully and stood in front of [Tian Xing], he was her trusted confidant Jiang Shize.
0:51:35|0:51:46|Upon hearing the report, [Tian Xing]'s expression became somewhat subtle. She involuntarily straightened her body and tilted her head slightly upwards, while Jiang wore a worried expression, clearly not wanting to confront [Tian Ji'an] directly.
0:51:46|0:51:53|Finally, she hid behind the screen. After saying that, [Ma Dongmei]
0:51:53|0:51:56|She picked up the small mirror on the table and looked into it as if no one else was around.
0:51:56|0:52:4|From time to time, she adjusted her hairpin without paying any attention to Tian Ji'an. Tian Ji'an walked straight to sit down beside Tian Xing.
0:52:4|0:52:13|Staring at the screen in front of her, [Tian Ji'an] looked ahead calmly, still maintaining a poker face.
0:52:39|0:52:45|[Tian Ji'an] disdainfully locked eyes with her. After that, [Tian Ji'an] looked back at the bronze mirror.
0:52:45|0:52:56|[Tian Ji'an] got up and walked towards the outside of the room. Hearing this,
0:52:57|0:53:6|[Tian Ji'an] raised the corners of his mouth, revealing a half-true, half-fake smile. However, as soon as [Tian Ji'an] completely left, he immediately restrained his expression.
0:53:6|0:53:21|The eyes revealed an unprecedented chill, while Jiang stood there still nodding obediently. The two maids acted as if nothing had happened, carrying a tray with head ornaments to [Tian Ji'an], carefully adorning her once again.
0:53:21|0:53:23|During the rebellion in Zhaoyi Town back then,
0:53:23|0:53:32|General Yuan Yi's rebellion against the court failed, leading him to flee to Weibo with 5000 elite soldiers and over ten thousand families. At that time, [Tian Xing] was overjoyed.
0:53:32|0:53:39|Not only did he accept the Yuan family, but also let the crown prince [Tian Ji'an] marry Yuan Yi's daughter, forming a relationship between the two families.
0:53:39|0:53:44|How could he know that he was inviting the wolf into the house? Now, apart from the court,
0:53:44|0:53:51|The arrival of Yuan and his servant Jiang Shize poses a strong threat to [Tian Ji'an]. They are responsible for the burial of Lady Autumn.
0:53:51|0:53:57|[Tian Ji'an] knew what the Yuan family had done but heard nothing more, but times have changed.
0:53:57|0:54:0|Will the life and death of [Tian Xing] still be controlled by the Yuan family?
0:54:0|0:54:4|The next day, [Tian Ji'an] walked with [Xia Jing] in a long corridor.
0:54:4|0:54:13|[Tian Ji'an] and [Xia Jing] didn't pause for a moment, walking straight ahead. However, when they reached the next corner, [Tian Ji'an] suddenly stopped in his tracks.
0:54:13|0:54:21|[Xia Jing] immediately stopped as well. He stood still on the corridor bridge for a long time, imagining the secluded seven somewhere.
0:54:22|0:54:30|He was sure that Nie Yinniang could see him. In fact, compared to Tian Yuan Shi's pervasive surveillance of the Tian family and her hidden agenda,
0:54:30|0:54:39|Nie Yinniang, who only wants to kill herself, is more appealing to Tian Ji'an. But neither side is something he can easily shake.
0:54:39|0:54:48|At this point, Tian Ji'an's face darkened even more, and he strode forward with determination. Meanwhile, the outdoor scene was completely different.
0:54:48|0:54:53|The mist-like clouds constantly lingered in the air, making it difficult to breathe.
0:54:53|0:54:55|Come. At the foot of the mountain,
0:54:55|0:55:4|It was the farewell ceremony of [Tian Xing], [Nie Feng] and [Tian Xing] had already raised their wine glasses to their wives, and then the two wives stepped forward together.
0:55:4|0:55:13|They held a wine cup in their left hand, dipped a few drops of wine with their right hand and flicked it into the air, then dipped a few more drops and sprinkled it on the ground.
0:55:13|0:55:21|Then she raised the wine cup with both hands and spilled some wine in front of herself. Finally, [Nie Tian Shi] turned around to face her elder brother [Tian Xing].
0:55:24|0:55:38|[Tian Xing] remained silent, nodding slightly at [Mrs. Nie], then turned his gaze to his own wife and children. Finally, he raised his glass, finished the remaining wine in one gulp. When the wine is gone, the courtesy is over, and saying anything more would be meaningless.
0:55:38|0:55:47|[Tian Xing] placed the wine glass on the tray held up by the attendant, frowned and looked around with a hint of nostalgia in his eyes. Soon,
0:55:47|0:55:57|The group set off on the road. This time, there were only 9 people escorting Tian Xing, including Nie Feng. Mrs. Nie, Mrs. Tian, and their servants stood quietly under the tree.
0:55:57|0:56:4|Watching as the group left. This was destined to be a journey that was neither easy nor comfortable, [Tian Ji'an] was not foolish.
0:56:4|0:56:10|He accurately identified that [Tian Xing] was feigning illness and promptly demoted him to a distant post.
0:56:10|0:56:17|Tian Ji'an specifically went to Nie Tian Shi's room to hint at Tian Xing's exile, possibly with the intention of using someone else to do the dirty work. But at the same time,
0:56:17|0:56:26|He dispatched [Nie Feng] to escort him three years ago under the pretext of a burial ritual. Now that [Nie Yinniang] has returned home, she naturally will not allow any harm to come to her father along the way.
0:56:26|0:56:30|At this moment, the three-tiered candlestick in the room is lit with six or seven candles.
0:56:30|0:56:37|Through the black veil, a mysterious light shines. In the center of the room sits an old man with a bald head and a thick beard.
0:56:37|0:56:47|He dipped his hands into the paint on the table, as if painting something. The old man looked up and gave a word of advice before returning to his own work.
0:56:47|0:57:0|[Jiang Shize] stood motionless behind the black veil, only approaching the old man when the attendants walked out of the room.
0:57:1|0:57:15|Before [Tian Ji'an] finished speaking, the old man immediately raised his index finger and made a gesture for silence. He first looked up at the door, then continued to bow his head and busy himself with what was in his hands.
0:57:15|0:57:24|Jiang Shize's face showed a hint of confusion, following the old man's gaze, then hesitantly shifting his gaze back to the old man.
0:57:24|0:57:31|The door suddenly pushed open, and the previous attendant walked in, followed by five or six men in black.
0:57:31|0:57:42|After everyone entered the room, [Tian Ji'an] hurriedly went up to greet them. It seemed that [Tian Ji'an] said a few more words.
0:57:42|0:57:55|The man in the lead nodded decisively after listening, then [Jiang Shize] waved his hand. The man in the lead then led the others out of the room, carefully closed the door, and only then left.
0:57:55|0:58:4|The old man here is Master Kong Kong'er, Jing Jing'er's master. The sky quickly darkened, and before they knew it, it was already the hour of the tiger. Suddenly,
0:58:4|0:58:18|In the woods, three or four torches were lit and moving rapidly. It could be seen that this was a small team of five or six people from the previous tribe, galloping non-stop on the road. Upon seeing the torches, everyone immediately grabbed the reins.
0:58:21|0:58:40|Arriving late at night, the leading man found nothing but emptiness. He seemed somewhat frustrated and wasted no time, immediately pulling the reins and rushing forward. The others followed closely behind, and before long, they arrived at the hour of the Rabbit. A figure in black stood in the middle of the road, holding a horse, clearly waiting for a long time.
0:58:50|0:59:2|The leading man pondered for a moment and then immediately gave orders. He pointed to the two people on his right to chase after the fork in the road, while he led the others.
0:59:2|0:59:10|Continue to move towards the main road. Before long, the sun hung high in the sky, casting dappled light and shadow on the path through the dense forest.
0:59:10|0:59:16|The two individuals previously assigned to pursue towards the fork in the road, drove their horses through the dense forest and galloped away.
0:59:16|0:59:28|Not knowing how much time had passed, they continued to navigate through the narrow sealed paths. The round-faced man at the front was the first to sense something amiss. He held the reins, drew his sword, and vigilantly scanned the surroundings.
0:59:28|0:59:35|Before the tall, thin man could react, he was cut down by several bailiffs who rushed out from the dense forest.
0:59:35|0:59:43|[Tian Xing] emerged from the woods with a fierce expression on his face. Before the constables could surround him again, a long arrow shot towards him.
0:59:43|0:59:50|Tian Xing was shot through by a constable, and it turned out that the previous group of people had caught up.
0:59:50|1:0:0|Swinging his long sword forward, [Tian Ji'an] charged ahead, while the round-faced man behind him swiftly threw out a chain, accurately tripping his lower leg and causing him to fall heavily in front of everyone.
1:0:0|1:0:4|Nearby the small waterfall, a young boy squatted on a rock.
1:0:4|1:0:12|He submerged the bamboo tube in the water. After a while, when it was filled with water, he took it out and firmly sealed the lid.
1:0:12|1:0:18|Rising and walking towards the bookcase behind, the boy carefully hung the bamboo tube on the bookcase, preparing to leave.
1:0:18|1:0:26|Unexpectedly, she was drawn by the voices around her. At this moment, [Nie Feng] had already been subdued by the men in black, his hands bound behind his back.
1:0:26|1:0:38|Beside him, a person placed a sharp sword against his neck without hesitation, while two others were diligently filling in pits in front of [Nie Feng], with [Tian Xing] inside the pit, tied up and squirming restlessly.
1:0:38|1:0:47|The boy in front of the waterfall at this moment, holding a wooden stick in his hand, stealthily lurked in the woods. Suddenly, he crouched down and quickly rushed towards the edge of the pit.
1:0:47|1:0:54|First, the black-clad figure tackled one person to the ground, then swung a wooden stick to knock down another. Seeing this, the other two black-clad figures picked up their knives and lunged towards the boy.
1:0:56|1:1:3|[Nie Feng] stood still from beginning to end, with no change in expression. It was clear that this young man had no intention of engaging in battle.
1:1:3|1:1:10|Instead, she deftly dodged around the trees. Two figures in black chased closely behind, realizing that the boy's skills were not good.
1:1:10|1:1:16|The only way to delay time was through some small actions. The boy was seen tripping over while pulling up the vine by the tree.
1:1:16|1:1:24|Looping around the figure in black, [Tian Ji'an] was so focused on wielding his weapon that he failed to notice in time, and ended up falling flat on his face.
1:1:24|1:1:36|Just as the outcome was still uncertain, a spirited horse appeared in the jungle. [Nie Yinniang] dismounted and walked towards [Mirror-polishing Boy] at a steady pace.
1:1:36|1:1:40|Dealing with these black-clad individuals was just too easy. In no time,
1:1:40|1:1:48|[Mirror-polishing Boy] turned back again, circling by the kang quietly, lurking past, then suddenly stood up and swung the stick.
1:1:48|1:1:55|However, the black-clad figure here was well-prepared, constantly evading his attacks and even striking back with a sword.
1:1:55|1:2:2|The boy, after missing a strike, panicked and ran to the tree, only to be impaled by a sword from the black-clothed person and pinned to the tree.
1:2:3|1:2:11|Another black-clad figure was about to strike with his sword when he was blocked by [Nie Yinniang] descending from above. Suddenly they swarmed in.
1:2:11|1:2:19|Nie Yinniang fearlessly stepped forward and wielded her dagger. In just one round, three people were simultaneously stabbed in the neck.
1:2:19|1:2:25|When [Nie Yinniang] turned around again, the three of them were already dead on the ground. Despite General [Nie Feng] having experienced many storms and waves,
1:2:25|1:2:34|Also shocked by his daughter's decisive and swift skills, he widened his eyes. By now, it was already afternoon, but the sky was dark and gloomy.
1:2:34|1:2:41|The team escorting [Tian Xing] set off again, with [Nie Yinniang] leading the way with a mule. Behind her
1:2:41|1:2:49|It is the young man who just helped out and the old man who accompanied him. The young man often wears a bronze mirror on his chest, he is a master of magic mirrors.
1:2:49|1:2:58|The old man is a herbalist. The young man's ancestors were builders from the Kingdom of Siam, who came to Japan in their early years to construct the Byodo-in Temple.
1:2:58|1:3:5|For over 200 years, he has resided in the country of Wa. Three years ago, his father was honored to be selected as a builder on the Tang envoy ship.
1:3:5|1:3:12|Unexpectedly encountering a storm and getting injured on the way back, he came to the Tang Dynasty in place of his father, only to encounter another storm. In a moment of danger, [Tian Ji'an]...
1:3:12|1:3:20|The boy was fortunate to be saved by the old herbalist, so he has been by the old man's side for three years to repay the life-saving favor.
1:3:20|1:3:34|The old man usually travels far and wide to collect medicinal herbs, some of which grow in uninhabited areas and vary by season, so he relies on villagers to help collect them. Afterwards, he will make them into pills to repay the villagers.
1:3:34|1:3:41|[Nie Yinniang] hired a few villagers from somewhere, who carefully carried [Nie Feng] in a bamboo basket with [Nie Yinniang] closely following them. Along the way.
1:3:41|1:3:50|They came across a cliff with a huge natural cave below. The cave was pitch black inside, so dark that you couldn't see your hand in front of your face.
1:3:50|1:3:57|The person in front calmly lit the torches, moving forward slowly in the flickering firelight, gradually,
1:3:57|1:4:3|In the distance, a faint light appeared, and they finally saw the way out. The group did not extinguish their torches.
1:4:3|1:4:9|Walking forward calmly as usual, it was clear that this was not an ordinary official road. Inside the cave, [Tian Ji'an]...
1:4:9|1:4:16|The elderly herbalist took the lead, leading everyone into a completely unfamiliar path for the rest.
1:4:16|1:4:23|[Nie Yinniang], as a top assassin, naturally wouldn't entrust her back to anyone. However,
1:4:23|1:4:38|This time she was able to follow the old man onto this path, showing an obvious level of trust towards him. After an unknown amount of time had passed, the sky was no longer as dazzling as before. The group walked through a familiar and ripe reed marsh, their steps appearing exhausted.
1:4:38|1:4:45|At this moment, the woodcutter with his two young sons walked along the country path and happened to come across [Nie Yinniang] and her group.
1:4:45|1:4:50|The woodcutter quietly moved to the side, making way for their group.
1:4:50|1:4:56|The once silent scene suddenly came to life with the arrival of these few individuals. The next moment...
1:4:56|1:5:3|They arrived at a village where the houses were built with mud walls and thatched roofs.
1:5:3|1:5:13|They twisted small branches into a crooked makeshift fence, neatly stacked firewood against the wall, filling the air with the smell of smoke and fire.
1:5:13|1:5:18|A mother stood in the corner watching her young son happily swinging a wooden stick nearby.
1:5:18|1:5:25|As she passed by [Nie Yinniang], she just glanced at her subconsciously and then started playing with her young son.
1:5:25|1:5:33|The hired villagers have already tied the horses along with Nie Yinniang's mule to the fence, taking care of them very carefully.
1:5:33|1:5:42|In the village, the skills of [Mirror-polishing Boy] were put to good use. He was seen sitting on a low stool, with a cloth spread out on a small stool in front of him.
1:5:42|1:5:50|A mirror that has been polished to a shine is placed on the cloth. He crumples a clean cloth into a ball and carefully wipes away the dust on the mirror.
1:5:50|1:5:57|Turning around to show everyone, they looked at themselves in the mirror and burst into laughter one by one. Afterwards
1:5:57|1:6:5|The boy hung the mirror on the pillar and started brushing it. The scene inside the room was completely different at this moment.
1:6:5|1:6:11|In the dim space, there was only a small window of less than half a meter, like a cage.
1:6:11|1:6:18|In the middle of the room, a very rudimentary stove made of mud was built, and [Nie Yinniang] set up a clay pot next to the stove.
1:6:18|1:6:25|The herbs brewed inside are all for healing [Nie Feng]. She sat quietly on the side, watching the flames rising in the middle of the stove.
1:6:25|1:6:34|And [Nie Feng] was already in the corner not far away, remaining silent with no change in expression. [Nie Yinniang] waited until the timing was right,
1:6:34|1:6:41|Picking up a piece of cloth to pad the handle of the sand pot, the already fried medicinal soup was poured into a bowl next to it.
1:6:41|1:6:48|Nie Yinniang then walked towards Nie Feng with a bowl in her hands. She knelt down in front of Nie Feng.
1:6:48|1:6:55|The bowl of medicine in her hand was blown repeatedly until it reached the right temperature before being handed to [Nie Feng].
1:6:55|1:7:2|He glanced at his daughter with a hint of surprise, then leaned over the bowl and sipped the medicinal soup with difficulty.
1:7:2|1:7:8|[Nie Yinniang] showed no signs of impatience, her expression remained cold but her movements were meticulous.
1:7:8|1:7:17|[Nie Feng] took a few sips of medicine, then fixed his gaze on [Nie Yinniang]. He paused slightly, took another sip, and then remained still.
1:7:23|1:7:30|As a father who is not good with words, this sentence has already conveyed all of [Nie Feng]'s feelings for his daughter. When [Nie Feng] said this sentence,
1:7:30|1:7:38|It must have taken a lot of courage, but [Nie Yinniang] still couldn't bring herself to look up and face [Nie Feng]. Meanwhile, [Nie Yinniang] remained silent as she looked at [Nie Feng] in front of her.
1:7:38|1:7:45|After a long time, [Nie Feng] finally couldn't hold back and cautiously raised his head to look at his daughter's face. However
1:7:45|1:7:56|[Nie Yinniang] immediately lowered her head to avoid her father's gaze, got up and sat down next to the stove, while the sobbing breath silently expressed her current mood to [Nie Feng].
1:7:56|1:8:2|Obviously she is still resentful. After many years, the first conversation between father and daughter ended in this way.
1:8:3|1:8:14|From the moment [Nie Yinniang] decided to abandon her mission and escort her father with [Tian Xing], she was no longer just a cold-blooded killer who followed orders, but had become a person with her own thoughts.
1:8:14|1:8:20|The night sky in the early morning is shrouded in mist, and under the faint moonlight, the scenery in front is vaguely discernible.
1:8:20|1:8:27|Before long, the thin mist on the water dispersed, replaced by a drizzle. Suddenly,
1:8:27|1:8:35|A stone was thrown into the lake, creating ripples on the surface. Countless birds on the withered branches of the island were startled and flew away.
1:8:35|1:8:41|Flapping its wings, it flew off into the distance. Not long after, another pebble was thrown into the water.
1:8:41|1:8:47|It soared into the air after touching the surface of the water at the bottom, flying a short distance before plunging into the water.
1:8:47|1:8:55|The color of the sky faded as the flying birds went away, and the hazy mountains emerged. Shortly after
1:8:55|1:9:0|The flying bird turned into a tiny black dot, disappearing into nature. At this moment, [Nie Yinniang]
1:9:0|1:9:16|[Nie Yinniang] and her group settled in a quiet village, where only wisps of smoke rising from the houses silently indicated the presence of remaining inhabitants. Behind the village lay a dense forest, shrouded in morning mist, obscuring its full appearance.
1:9:16|1:9:31|In front of every house, there was an irregular vegetable garden, simple and tranquil. The charcoal inside the house burned vigorously, with flames flickering, and the smoke drifted out through the window. In the reflection of the charcoal fire, the entire interior of the house could be clearly seen.
1:9:31|1:9:39|The Mirror-polishing Boy lay on a grass mat in the corner, his face illuminated by flickering flames, sleeping soundly.
1:9:39|1:9:46|The tranquility was soon shattered, as an unknown cry in the distance woke him from his dream, causing him to shiver.
1:9:46|1:9:55|Opening his eyes, Tian Ji'an found his vision clear. He struggled to prop himself up and looked towards the door for a while, but drowsiness soon overcame him.
1:9:55|1:9:57|Lying back down on the grass mat.
1:9:57|1:9:59|Suddenly he straightened up again,
1:9:59|1:10:7|Leaning against the wall, [Tian Ji'an] sighed. It seemed like he remembered something, a smile appeared on his face, then he shrugged off his outer robe.
1:10:7|1:10:16|Standing up, she moved towards the stove to check on the charcoal fire. Above the stove was a rack with a pot hanging on it for boiling water. The boy avoided the pot.
1:10:16|1:10:29|Picking up dry firewood and stirring the charcoal, he then picked up a hollow tube about the thickness of an arm from the side, blowing gently at the fire. After a few blows, sparks flickered and several sparks burst out.
1:10:29|1:10:33|At this moment, [Nie Feng] is still sound asleep, lying on his side on the couch.
1:10:33|1:10:42|Lying on a pillow made of licorice, covered with a thick blanket. Soon, the door creaked open, and someone had already left.
1:10:42|1:10:49|However, [Nie Feng] remained sound asleep, undisturbed. The Mirror-polishing Boy, dressed neatly, held a wooden stick in his hand.
1:10:49|1:10:57|Standing in a field overgrown with weeds, constantly looking around as if searching for something. The sky was just beginning to brighten.
1:10:57|1:11:4|The scene remained gloomy, with weeds on the field growing up to half a meter high, making the young boy in the middle appear particularly small.
1:11:4|1:11:12|The boy completely disregarded the hurried surroundings and ran forward. Time quickly passed, and now the sun was high in the sky.
1:11:12|1:11:20|The warm light shines everywhere. [Nie Yinniang] walks through a forest with a cold face, her eyes shifting without a word.
1:11:20|1:11:28|[Nie Yinniang] kept her eyes constantly scanning the surroundings. Her left hand clenched into a fist, while her right hand held a curved dagger like a crescent moon.
1:11:28|1:11:37|On the other side, a person dismounted from the horse, it was the assassin [Jing Jing'er] wearing a golden mask. She held a curved blade that was half an arm's length.
1:11:37|1:11:43|Walking cautiously while looking around vigilantly, she raised the dagger in her hand slightly, assuming a simple defensive posture.
1:11:44|1:11:52|However, after a long time of not being able to find her target, her steps gradually slowed down. The face under the mask was as cold as ice.
1:11:52|1:12:0|Her eyes revealed a hint of nervousness and guilt. Finally, she stopped in her tracks, looked around, and then seemed to breathe a sigh of relief.
1:12:0|1:12:3|The hand holding the dagger slowly lowered.
1:12:3|1:12:8|The birch forest is now completely bare, looking up from below.
1:12:8|1:12:17|The sky was covered with dark branches, stretching across the entire sky. As time passed, the clouds in the sky kept rolling and changing. With a gentle breeze blowing,
1:12:17|1:12:25|The treetops at the top of the birch tree also swayed slightly, and the great battle seemed imminent. The masters were in a fierce struggle, with only a hair's breadth difference between them.
1:12:25|1:12:33|Nie Yinniang nodded slightly and cautiously glanced at Jing Jing'er to her right. Every step she took was exceptionally careful and cautious.
1:12:33|1:12:39|Like a falcon searching for the best moment to strike. Suddenly, [Jing Jing'er] made the first move.
1:12:39|1:12:49|She swung her sword horizontally, and as [Nie Yinniang] dodged backwards, she predictably reached out her left hand to grab [Nie Yinniang], then the stabbing dagger swung back for another strike.
1:12:49|1:12:57|[Nie Yinniang] held a dagger against the curved sword and was forced to retreat several steps, [Jing Jing'er] had a weapon twice as long as [Nie Yinniang], gaining the upper hand.
1:12:57|1:13:5|Her every move showed no mercy as she struck with deadly precision. However, [Nie Yinniang] countered each move with equal skill, making it difficult to determine a clear winner for a moment, until suddenly
1:13:5|1:13:13|[Jing Jing'er] knocked away [Nie Yinniang]'s dagger with a single stroke and then slashed towards [Nie Yinniang], who quickly adjusted her sword stance in an instant.
1:13:13|1:13:16|A backhand strike to Jing Jing'er's cheek. This move...
1:13:16|1:13:19|Afterwards, [Jing Jing'er] held a knife in her right hand.
1:13:19|1:13:25|Facing away from [Nie Yinniang], the bright cloak fluttered on its own, waiting for [Jing Jing'er] to turn around again.
1:13:25|1:13:31|The golden mask on her face cracked a fine line from top to bottom. She did not pay attention to the change in the mask.
1:13:31|1:13:39|Instead, he stopped and looked at [Nie Yinniang]. The mask fell off with a sound, the two looked at each other in silence, and finally [Jing Jing'er] took the first step forward.
1:13:39|1:13:42|Passed by [Nie Yinniang] and left directly.
1:13:42|1:13:53|[Nie Yinniang] nodded slightly in the direction [Jing Jing'er] left, then walked away without any hesitation. Under the mask was a familiar face of [Tian Ji'an].
1:13:53|1:14:4|[Tian Ji'an] believes that [Nie Yinniang] is his greatest threat, so he decides to defeat her. However, [Nie Yinniang] manages to split [Tian Ji'an]'s mask without harming him at all.
1:14:4|1:14:8|Let the other party know the outcome of this duel. In the eyes of [Nie Yinniang],
1:14:8|1:14:17|The concept of protecting Tian Ji'an and protecting the family's beliefs are not conflicting for Lady Tian, and she has also come to understand Nie Yinniang's inner thoughts.
1:14:17|1:14:24|At that moment, the two masters instantly understood each other. [Nie Yinniang] continued walking towards the village along the original route.
1:14:24|1:14:32|As she crossed the wilderness, her right hand seemed less agile than before, but she appeared completely unconcerned.
1:14:32|1:14:40|The Mirror-polishing Boy fell behind her, creating quite a distance between them. Suddenly, Nie Yinniang's steps paused for a moment.
1:14:40|1:15:2|The boy's already slow pace became even slower, hesitating for a moment thinking that [Nie Yinniang] was waiting for him. He ran forward in big strides, but before he could take a few steps, he saw [Nie Yinniang] holding his right arm and continuing to walk. The boy was unsure of [Nie Yinniang]'s intentions, so he slowed down and stood still for a while, ultimately unable to resist following behind her.
1:15:2|1:15:27|[Nie Yinniang] continued walking forward without looking back, holding her arm. Suddenly, she stopped again and stood still, which puzzled the boy. He immediately walked around to her and checked the injury on her right shoulder. Perhaps Nie Yinniang had never been cared for like this before. She lowered her head and quickened her pace, the boy hesitated to raise his hand to stop her, but in the end, he let her go.
1:15:27|1:15:34|Upon returning to the room, [Nie Yinniang] exposed the injured right shoulder and allowed [Mirror-polishing Boy] to treat the wound.
1:15:34|1:15:41|Her always restrained face involuntarily showed a look of pain. [Mirror-polishing Boy] sat behind her.
1:15:41|1:15:50|Methodically, [Tian Ji'an] cleaned her wound and then opened the lid of the golden sore medicine. He pinched a small amount of powder and gently sprinkled it on her wound.
1:15:50|1:16:2|As the medicine powder continued to soak in, [Nie Yinniang]'s brows furrowed even tighter. Although she made no sound, her constantly shifting body revealed the unbearable pain she was trying to endure.
1:16:2|1:16:6|However, at this moment, besides the physical pain, there was more psychological agony.
1:16:6|1:16:13|She lowered her head and looked quietly at the ground, with a hint of hidden grievance and sadness between her eyebrows.
1:16:13|1:16:19|And all of this took place in Nie Feng's room, where he was still leaning against the wall with half a thin blanket draped over him.
1:16:19|1:16:28|He silently watched all this, without saying a word. As a father, he never knew what his daughter had been through all these years.
1:16:28|1:16:40|[When Nie Yinniang] spoke, [Nie Feng] couldn't help but hold his breath and focus.
1:16:40|1:16:58|Almost imperceptibly, Tian Ji'an sat up straight, silently gazing at her. After hearing these words,
1:17:0|1:17:8|[Nie Yinniang] seems to be unable to control her emotions. Her eyebrows are tightly furrowed, her chin trembles slightly, and her eyes are lonely and lifeless.
1:17:8|1:17:23|The green cherry blossoms dance in the mirror, speaking not only of Princess Jiacheng, but also of herself. Thinking of this, [Nie Yinniang] self-mockingly curls up the corners of her mouth, a fleeting hint of a forced smile. What follows is a surge of overwhelming loneliness and bitterness.
1:17:23|1:17:31|Mirror-polishing Boy may not fully understand what Nie Yinniang is saying, but he can clearly feel the sadness emanating from her very core.
1:17:31|1:17:39|He hesitated for a moment before placing his hand on the bare shoulder of [Nie Yinniang], gently comforting her. In that moment, [Nie Yinniang] understood.
1:17:39|1:17:46|This person has completely understood her. She closed her eyes tightly, with tears shimmering at the corners of her eyes. It's unclear when.
1:17:46|1:17:54|[Nie Feng] has shifted his gaze, tilting his head with his line of sight lowered, still maintaining a poker face.
1:17:54|1:18:0|But a tear had been hidden in the eyes for a long time, shimmering faintly in the candlelight.
1:18:0|1:18:6|[Mirror-polishing Boy] paid no attention to the cryptic communication between the father and daughter. He covered the ointment jar.
1:18:6|1:18:12|He neatly packed the rest of the tools into his own box. All he needed to understand was,
1:18:12|1:18:20|A sincere heart towards [Nie Yinniang] is enough. And now, the once vented [Nie Yinniang] has completely restrained all emotions.
1:18:20|1:18:27|As a killer and assassin, she carries countless hidden weapons on her. In the dim candlelight,
1:18:27|1:18:34|She could only see her stuffing small items into her waist, putting them in her pockets, and buttoning up her sleeves. Then
1:18:34|1:18:38|She took another leather belt from the shelf and fastened it around her waist.
1:18:38|1:18:47|At this moment, the main hall of the military governor's mansion presented a lively scene of singing and dancing. This banquet was hosted by [Tian Ji'an] to entertain the loyal courtiers.
1:18:47|1:18:56|Grand and luxurious. Seven or eight dancers gathered in the center, dressed in gorgeous and flowing attire, elegantly swaying their bodies. [Tian Ji'an] wore a magnificent official robe,
1:18:56|1:18:59|Sitting cross-legged in the main seat, still squinting.
1:18:59|1:19:6|To the beat of the music, Tian Ji'an taps the drum in his cup with intoxication. And his second son is also brought to the main hall.
1:19:6|1:19:10|Sitting beside him, the second son did not quite understand the scene in front of him.
1:19:10|1:19:16|He looked at the dancer and then turned to look at [Tian Ji'an]. To the right of the main seat is a group of four drummers.
1:19:16|1:19:25|Three women and one man. On the right side of the main hall are several men dressed in cold-colored clothing, savoring the food in front of them. They are facing each other.
1:19:25|1:19:31|It was a group of men in colorful attire, holding wine glasses and chatting happily, with clear distinctions between the two sides.
1:19:31|1:19:47|[Tian Ji'an] paid no attention to the surging undercurrent below the stage. He drummed away as if no one else was there, his gaze never leaving the dancing girl in front of him, who was none other than [Hu Ji]. [Hu Ji] stood in the center, smiling coquettishly as she raised her hand to look at [Tian Ji'an].
1:19:47|1:19:52|Her leg lifted slightly, silently displaying her soft and graceful posture.
1:19:52|1:20:2|She then fluttered her eyes and tiptoed forward, extending her boneless soft gestures towards [Tian Ji'an]. Obviously, [Tian Ji'an] was quite taken with this.
1:20:2|1:20:11|He set the drum aside and immediately walked towards [Hu Ji]. [Tian Ji'an] had his back to [Hu Ji], kneeling on one knee, then turned his head to look back.
1:20:11|1:20:18|The two of them exchanged a knowing smile, dancing gracefully to the music together, as [Hu Ji] resounded with joy and cheer.
1:20:18|1:20:23|[Tian Ji'an] stopped jumping shortly after. He circled around [Hu Ji] on her side,
1:20:23|1:20:34|He gazed at her without blinking, then gave a meaningful smile. He reached out and embraced [Hu Ji] by her slender waist, and [Hu Ji] fell into his arms.
1:20:34|1:20:40|Laughing freely. In stark contrast to the lively atmosphere in the main hall, the room was very quiet.
1:20:40|1:20:48|Only three candles on the table were emitting a faint light. At this moment, a pair of old and powerful hands were resting on the table.
1:20:48|1:20:55|Tearing a piece of white paper about the size of two palms, you can vaguely see that it is tearing a human figure. Looking from a distance,
1:20:55|1:21:4|It can be clearly judged that this person is [Jing Jing'er]. Although these actions seem simple, [Jing Jing'er] is full of caution.
1:21:4|1:21:13|He pushed the other scraps of paper on the table aside and slowly laid out the paper figure. Then he pressed down on the paper with his right hand.
1:21:13|1:21:29|With his left middle finger dipped in the liquid from the silver bowl, he touched the paper figure's legs, then took some pigment from the inkstone and applied it to the figure's limbs. He then picked up the paper figure, glanced at it, threw it into the nearby water tank, and began chanting an incantation.
1:21:32|1:21:50|With Jing Jing'er chanting softly, the paper figure sank to the bottom of the vat and unexpectedly took on a standing posture. Subsequently, the paper continued to tilt downwards, causing the ink on it to seep out.
1:21:50|1:21:57|Slowly dissolving in the water. What's even more eerie is that the paper eventually sank in the water tank, completely disappearing.
1:21:57|1:22:3|The previously dissolved pigments were also nowhere to be found, as if there had never been anything there to begin with.
1:22:3|1:22:5|Outside the mansion, the patrol team consists of three people in each group.
1:22:5|1:22:12|Carrying a torch, [Tian Ji'an] vigilantly patrolled the surroundings. Along the corridor, a fire basin was set up every few meters for illumination.
1:22:12|1:22:19|The eaves were also adorned with neatly arranged lanterns. However, the illumination from the candlelight was always limited, just faintly lighting up the long corridor.
1:22:19|1:22:25|Nearby the pavilion, it was pitch black, with an eerie and sinister atmosphere permeating everywhere.
1:22:25|1:22:33|One can vaguely see a well cover placed on the wellhead next to the pavilion, with a bright and thick invisible fluid flowing out through the cracks, meandering close to the ground.
1:22:33|1:22:37|The small grove was shrouded in darkness with only the black branches visible against the light.
1:22:37|1:22:45|The soldiers were too focused on patrolling the surroundings of the house and never expected that danger lurked here. Looking in the direction of the patrol team, [Tian Ji'an] saw...
1:22:45|1:23:6|Only a few white peonies could be seen in a corner of the woods. At this moment, the other side that was previously facing it was completely empty, not even a lantern was lit. Just a few torches burning not far from the pavilion barely brought some light to the surroundings. It seemed as if a shadow was swaying and drifting under the foundation of the corridor.
1:23:6|1:23:14|He moved silently, calmly approaching his target. This corridor was [Hu Ji]'s only way through.
1:23:14|1:23:21|The paper figure cut by Jing Jing'er's hand only had the birth date of [Hu Ji]. [Hu Ji] was pregnant.
1:23:21|1:23:29|She was afraid that Lady Yuan would harm her child, so she used chicken blood to fake her menstruation, even [Tian Ji'an] dared not inform. It can be seen that she is a clear-minded person in the mansion.
1:23:29|1:23:38|A clever person with a stake in the matter. However, despite the concealment, the all-pervasive Yuanshi family easily learned of this secret.
1:23:38|1:23:41|Although the main characters of the Green Plume Dance Mirror are Princess Jiacheng and [Nie Yinniang],...
1:23:41|1:23:48|[Nie Yinniang], but [Hu Ji] is also another green luan. She lived alone in the palace, struggling hard.
1:23:48|1:23:54|And now, it seems even the child cannot be saved. At this moment, [Hu Ji]'s performance has ended.
1:23:54|1:24:2|She led the group of dancing girls out of the main hall, playfully arriving at the corridor. An elderly nanny holding a lantern hurriedly walked at the front.
1:24:2|1:24:8|Hu Ji was excitedly talking to the woman in the light, occasionally waving her sleeves and spinning around.
1:24:8|1:24:15|Even the usually reserved [Hu Ji] was smiling as she looked at the woman. Soon they stepped onto the corridor.
1:24:15|1:24:21|The lanterns on the top of the corridor are all lit up at this moment, with neatly arranged candle holders on the side for illumination.
1:24:21|1:24:29|The nanny sent them to the corridor and then turned back. The dancers were still frolicking and chasing each other in the brilliant candlelight.
1:24:29|1:24:36|[Hu Ji] was originally watching the dancing girls playfully with a smile, but suddenly felt very uncomfortable, and the smile gradually faded away.
1:24:36|1:24:42|She lifted her skirt and involuntarily covered her nose, furrowing her brows, standing by the pillar at this moment.
1:24:42|1:24:49|A faint wisp of smoke slowly rises. Before long, [Hu Ji] can no longer stand on her own.
1:24:49|1:24:59|She barely made it to the pillar, leaning against it and breathing lightly. Unaware of the thickening smoke, she leisurely spun around the pillar.
1:24:59|1:25:8|He went straight for [Hu Ji]'s body. The empty incantation had taken effect. At this moment, the nanny and the dancer who noticed something was wrong with [Hu Ji],
1:25:8|1:25:17|Having just searched from both ends of the corridor, [Hu Ji] was trembling and leaning against a pillar, enveloped in a cloud of smoke. The dancers had already been scared off and scattered.
1:25:17|1:25:29|Only [Nie Yinniang] quickly stepped forward, and with a wave of her hand, the smoke made a strange sound and then disappeared without a trace. By this time, [Hu Ji] had already fainted from exhaustion.
1:25:29|1:25:44|Tian Ji'an and Xia Jing, who arrived late, rushed up the corridor. The moment they saw Nie Yinniang, they drew their swords and attacked. Nie Yinniang did not fight back, only dodged the strike. Tian Ji'an did not linger either, quickly rushing forward to help Hu Ji, who was lying on the ground.
1:25:46|1:25:58|Xia Jing rushed up to fight fiercely with Nie Yinniang, while Tian Ji'an looked worried and embraced Hu Ji from behind. Suddenly, Hu Ji seemed to wake up from a dream, opened her eyes wide, and couldn't help but gasp for breath.
1:25:59|1:26:3|The maids and serving girls hurried forward to support [Tian Ji'an] as he caught [Hu Ji].
1:26:4|1:26:11|[Tian Ji'an] brandished the sword beside him and charged down the corridor towards [Nie Yinniang], who agilely dodged backwards.
1:26:11|1:26:19|Simultaneously knocking the weapon out of Xia Jing's hand, the dagger is already at Tian Ji'an's throat with another strike. Tian Ji'an's fist clenches tighter and tighter.
1:26:23|1:26:28|[Nie Yinniang] never lifted her head to meet [Tian Ji'an]'s intense gaze. She stared at [Tian Ji'an]'s collar.
1:26:28|1:26:36|After saying this, she put away the dagger and turned to leave. [Xia Jing] couldn't hold back any longer and was ready to rush up with the guards.
1:26:36|1:26:42|But was stopped by [Tian Ji'an]. [Xia Jing] immediately stopped, looking at [Tian Ji'an] with a hint of confusion.
1:26:42|1:26:50|[Tian Ji'an] stared in the direction where [Nie Yinniang] had left, remaining silent for a long time. As night fell, the corridor was empty with no one in sight.
1:26:50|1:26:58|Only the candlestick stood alone in the corner of the corridor, with the flames flickering as it burned, emitting puffs of smoke. At this moment
1:26:58|1:27:21|[Xia Jing] once again walked down the corridor holding a candlestick for illumination. He walked cautiously, observing the surroundings vigilantly. Eventually, he stopped in front of the pillar where [Hu Ji] had the accident. He kept scrutinizing the pillar, then circled it carefully, occasionally bringing the candlestick closer to it. Obviously, [Tian Ji'an] also felt that this was an unjust disaster.
1:27:21|1:27:39|Adding to the words left by [Nie Yinniang], it only deepened his doubts, so he had to once again send out his trusted guard [Xia Jing] to investigate the truth of the matter at this moment. However, after circling around the pillar from top to bottom, [Xia Jing] examined thoroughly but found nothing of value.
1:27:39|1:27:55|[Xia Jing] did not give up. Holding a candlestick, he slowly circled around again. Suddenly, he stopped in his tracks and gazed for a long time. He then picked up a paper figure from behind a pillar. [Xia Jing] carefully examined the paper figure in his hand, then suddenly looked up as if he had remembered something.
1:27:55|1:28:1|Carrying the paper figure, [Xia Jing] quickly left the corridor and the next moment appeared in [Tian Ji'an]'s study.
1:28:1|1:28:7|At this moment, [Tian Ji'an] is still wearing his official attire standing inside the room, [Xia Jing] takes out a paper figure from his bosom and hands it to [Tian Ji'an].
1:28:10|1:28:22|[Tian Ji'an] took the paper figure from [Xia Jing] with a puzzled expression. After examining it for a while without figuring out anything, before he could think further, he saw [Xia Jing] pulling out an identical paper figure from his pocket.
1:28:26|1:28:36|[Tian Ji'an] carefully compared two paper figures in his hands.
1:29:4|1:29:11|[Tian Ji'an] looked at [Xia Jing], then at the paper figure in his hand. He already had a plan in mind. Tonight would be a sleepless night for many.
1:29:11|1:29:20|The densely packed torches lit in the mansion of the military commissioner resembled a long dragon stretching endlessly. Led by [Xia Jing], a large number of soldiers moved silently.
1:29:20|1:29:28|Moved to the residence of Jing Jing'er, [Xia Jing] clearly understood that this person was not easy to deal with. He gathered the soldiers in the open space outside the house.
1:29:28|1:29:36|First, let some soldiers surround the house. Then lead the remaining dozen soldiers cautiously towards the outside of the house with crossbows in hand.
1:29:36|1:29:42|[Xia Jing] was the first to arrive at the front of the house, pressing his ear against the wooden door. Finally, [Xia Jing] broke through the door and entered.
1:29:42|1:29:49|Rushed in with the soldiers. However, the scene in front of them was quite different from what they had imagined, with no one fleeing.
1:29:49|1:29:56|Sitting upright at his own desk. His long drooping white eyebrows mingled with the grayish-white beard on his chest.
1:29:56|1:30:6|His eyes were devoid of any light, yet he stared unflinchingly at the unexpected guests. His towering hooked nose, coupled with drooping corners of his mouth, instilled a sense of fear in people.
1:30:6|1:30:12|He calmly stood up and looked at the soldiers in front of him without any unnecessary words, [Xia Jing] did not waste any time either.
1:30:12|1:30:19|Stepping aside, the soldiers behind immediately raised their crossbows and shot at the empty space. The empty space showed no intention of dodging.
1:30:19|1:30:27|With crossbow bolts piercing his chest, [Tian Xing] sat uneasily by the bedside in the bedroom, his makeup immaculate.
1:30:27|1:30:37|The eldest son sat with pursed lips on the other side. When the nanny brought the two young children to her,
1:30:37|1:30:43|She calmly got up and walked towards [Tian Ji'an], only to see [Tian Ji'an] angrily tearing two paper figures.
1:30:43|1:30:51|Tian Ji'an raised his hand in front of Nie Yinniang. The perceptive eldest son resolutely opened his arms to shield his mother. At this moment, Tian Ji'an was already furious to the extreme.
1:30:51|1:30:57|He suddenly drew his sword and pointed it directly at [Tian Yuan Shi], causing the surrounding servants and maidservants to instantly fall to their knees in a heap.
1:30:57|1:31:5|The eldest son was obviously frightened by his father's actions, trembling all over, but even so, he did not take a step back.
1:31:5|1:31:6|The calmest of all now
1:31:6|1:31:14|It was actually the party involved, [Tian Yuen Shi]. She remained calm and fearless, pulling her eldest son into her arms. After a long gaze,
1:31:14|1:31:22|[Tian Ji'an] lowered his sword, and his eldest son breathed a sigh of relief with lingering fear.
1:31:23|1:31:30|Tian Ji'an, who had nowhere to vent his anger, knocked over the vase beside him and left. Nie Tian Shi turned a blind eye to all this.
1:31:30|1:31:36|She patted her eldest son's arm, comforting him as she led him back to the bed. Hearing his mother's instructions, the eldest son obediently sat down on the couch.
1:31:40|1:31:43|[Tian Yuen Shi] patted the heads of her two sons to signal them to come over.
1:31:43|1:31:51|The two children who had been scared silly sat motionless on either side of their big brother. [Tian Ji'an] took a few more steps forward.
1:31:51|1:31:58|Calmly moving the shattered pieces of the vase away from the child's feet, [Tian Ji'an] sat down steadily on the other side.
1:31:58|1:32:6|The eldest son finally regained his senses at this moment, impatiently pulling up the sleeves that his younger brothers were sitting on, adjusting to a more comfortable position.
1:32:6|1:32:15|The maids who were kneeling on the ground hesitantly stood up and approached. Upon hearing the instructions from the mistress, several maids came forward and squatted down on the ground together.
1:32:15|1:32:23|Picking up the shattered pieces of the vase smashed by [Tian Ji'an], the children's gaze shifted quietly to watch the nannies' nimble hands.
1:32:24|1:32:31|They first put the fragments back into the vase intact, then picked up the scattered flower branches on the ground and piled them on the mouth of the vase.
1:32:31|1:32:39|[Tian Ji'an] just glanced briefly at the ground before continuing to look outside. After the maidservants withdrew, the eldest son nodded thoughtfully.
1:32:39|1:32:48|The second son finally breathed a sigh of relief. The next day, there was a discussion in the main hall.
1:33:33|1:33:42|At the same moment, the weather outside the suburbs was exceptionally pleasant, with no glaring sunlight.
1:33:42|1:33:49|White clouds leisurely drift in the sky. The princess nun is dressed in plain white, holding a dusting whisk in her right hand, with her left hand resting behind her.
1:33:49|1:34:5|Standing on the slope of the mountain top, she exudes an ethereal and elegant aura, blending seamlessly with nature at this moment, giving off a sense of aloofness from the world. Princess [Tian Ji'an] and nun Princess [Nie Yinniang], though twins, have vastly different choices and beliefs.
1:34:5|1:34:12|A shallow cut to protect the state, not knowing where to use the general, is a portrayal of Princess [Tian Ji'an]'s life.
1:34:12|1:34:17|She went from being a princess who wanted to ride in a luxurious carriage to actively dismissing her maidservant, the Lady of Weibo.
1:34:17|1:34:24|To fulfill the mission given by the emperor, her choice is to guard. Guarding Weibo without crossing the Heluo River.
1:34:24|1:34:30|Maintaining peace between Weibo and the court, Tian Ji'an spent his life caught between two political forces.
1:34:30|1:34:38|She was destined to be caught between her parents, brothers, husband, and children. If the Tang army conquers Weibo, her husband and children will die.
1:34:38|1:34:47|However, if the Wei Kingdom's power grows and threatens the court, it is also something she does not want to see. Only peace between the two sides is the best choice.
1:34:47|1:34:52|However, Princess [Nie Yinniang] is wholeheartedly loyal to the court, as she kills the military governors through assassination.
1:34:52|1:34:56|To help the court regain control of the region, [Tian Ji'an] decides to...
1:34:56|1:35:4|Although she was a princess, she spent her life in Weibo as a nun to train assassins, a path that was destined to be lonely.
1:35:4|1:35:20|At this mountain top is where she and [Nie Yinniang] agreed to meet. Regardless of whether [Nie Yinniang] completed the mission or not, she would report to her. Sure enough, as agreed, [Nie Yinniang] arrived, slowly walking up the mountain. The [nun] paid no attention to the arrival of [Nie Yinniang] and continued to gaze into the distance.
1:35:20|1:35:27|The master and disciple stood quietly for a long time, then [Nie Yinniang] turned around and the [nun] knelt down. In this kneeling act
1:35:27|1:35:42|[Nie Yinniang] has made many decisions. The [nun] seems to have known [Nie Yinniang]'s choice.
1:35:42|1:35:51|So there was no surprise at all.
1:35:54|1:35:59|The nun gazed into the distance, still showing no intention of turning back.
1:35:59|1:36:8|With a hint of helplessness and sigh, [Nie Yinniang] remained kneeling below the slope, silent for a long time, before finally changing from a single knee to both knees on the ground.
1:36:8|1:36:10|Bowed respectfully to [the nun] three times.
1:36:10|1:36:16|[Nie Yinniang]'s principle of not killing disciples is actually a warning to [Jing Jing'er], advising her not to kill [Tian Ji'an] either.
1:36:16|1:36:21|As for the reasons for not killing, whether it is political factors or family relationships,
1:36:21|1:36:28|[Nie Yinniang] has made it very clear. Yet [the nun] still sees [Nie Yinniang] merely as a tool for killing from beginning to end.
1:36:28|1:36:44|The assassin's tools do not need to consider their own killing intent. Up to this moment, [Nie Yinniang] still does not understand what [Tian Ji'an] is thinking. She still believes that the reason why [Nie Yinniang] does not kill [Tian Ji'an] is because of their childhood love. Three strikes, three bows, this is both an apology and a severing of grace.
1:36:44|1:36:52|[Nie Yinniang] got up and walked down the mountain without looking back. Before long, [Nie Yinniang] had already reached halfway down the mountain.
1:36:52|1:36:58|The area was vast and overgrown with weeds, almost submerging half of her calf. However, [Nie Yinniang] paid no attention to it.
1:36:58|1:37:7|Walking slowly down through the weeds, the sky gradually darkened, no longer the beautiful scenery of the mountaintop. It was unclear when,
1:37:7|1:37:15|The nun also descended from the mountain, walking slowly with her hands clasped around the whisk, about a hundred meters away from Nie Yinniang.
1:37:15|1:37:24|[Nie Yinniang] paid no attention to what was happening behind her, and walked straight down the mountain. From then on, the master and disciple went their separate ways completely.
1:37:26|1:37:31|Arriving at the foot of the mountain, [Nie Yinniang] suddenly swung her whisk towards [Tian Ji'an]. [Nie Yinniang] seemed to have anticipated this.
1:37:31|1:37:40|She bent down to dodge the attack from behind, leaped towards [Nie Yinniang]'s back, and drew out the dagger that had taken countless lives. [Nie Yinniang] swiftly turned around.
1:37:40|1:37:48|Nie Yinniang raised her dusting whisk and covered her face as she approached, while lowering her head to avoid the floating dust, the blade in her hand also swung towards the nun.
1:37:48|1:37:55|The [nun] suddenly paused, looking at [Nie Yinniang] with an expression of disbelief. After a long time, she slowly regained her composure.
1:37:55|1:38:3|Nie Yinniang retrieved the dust whisk back into her hands. Tian Ji'an, on the other hand, put away the dagger behind the nun and walked away along the mountain path without looking back.
1:38:3|1:38:12|As long as you pass through the tree-lined path, endless sunlight awaits ahead. The nun gazed at the departing figure of [Nie Yinniang] for a long time, unable to calm down.
1:38:12|1:38:20|On the right side of her Daoist robe, there was a two-inch long cut, but it did not harm her at all. This is a paradise away from the world.
1:38:20|1:38:28|Completely different from the political intrigues in the court, thick tree trunks were chopped down and made into crude fences, enclosing a group of sheep.
1:38:28|1:38:44|The old goat had snow-white wool and long beard naturally hanging down as it leisurely chewed under the sunlight, with two little lambs by its side looking harmless. A sturdy goat lazily lay in the stone trough, also chewing non-stop.
1:38:44|1:38:52|The most captivating sight was a black lamb in the corner of the fence, hiding behind the old sheep in a cluster of shadows.
1:38:52|1:38:57|Chewing on wet leaves in front of him, [Mirror-polishing Boy] and the old herb gatherer.
1:38:57|1:39:2|The villagers gathered outside the sheep pen, chatting and laughing, enjoying themselves.
1:39:2|1:39:11|During the conversation, [Mirror-polishing Boy] casually looked up as if he had seen something. He hesitated for a moment, then excitedly stood up upon recognizing the newcomer.
1:39:11|1:39:17|He pointed in the direction and quickly explained to the old man before running out of the courtyard. Just then,
1:39:17|1:39:33|[Nie Yinniang] appeared in the reeds leading a horse. When she saw the Mirror-polishing Boy running towards her gasping for breath, [Nie Yinniang] smiled for the first time. The boy immediately took the reins and happily led the horse back.
