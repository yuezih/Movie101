0:2:10|0:2:20|The forensic photographer nodded, a forensic expert guided another person to take photos, a forensic expert was making notes, and another one was collecting footprints. The police continued to pay attention to any overlooked clues by the river, while [Qian Guixing] who had been standing nearby walked away covering his mouth and nose.
0:2:32|0:2:49|[Qian Guixing] led the way, followed by the [forensic doctor] and [Police Liu] leaving the crime scene. Two police cars and three motorcycles were parked on the road next to the crime scene. [Police Liu] asked [Qian Guixing]: After thinking for a moment, the police said Lan Jie's name, and the police's words to the onlookers on the road were heard by the workers.
0:2:54|0:3:7|The road slopes down, the calm river water is still flowing, and on the ground lies a pair of black gloves. Through the bridge tunnel, you can see the [coroner] still working. The title of the film is "The Chase".
0:3:7|0:3:14|The first scene - Han Bao, [Song Lao'er] is repairing a car under the car, chatting with a friend in a jacket.
0:3:25|0:3:50|[Song Tao] handed over the wrench, the vibration in the pocket of his coat went unnoticed. Under the car, [Song Lao'er] spat out, then stopped his work and said:
0:4:7|0:4:9|Pass the tool to [Song Tao], [Song Lao'er] tried to do the carp stand, but failed to get up.
0:4:25|0:4:30|[Song Lao'er] glanced elsewhere, and finally [Qian Guixing] rode up to [Song Lao'er]. He stopped the motorcycle.
0:4:56|0:5:5|[Song Tao] quickly crawled under the car, [Song Lao'er] threw his sleeves and gloves, [Qian Guixing] echoed repeatedly, saying that, [Qian Guixing] quickly walked towards the motorcycle, with [Song Lao'er] following closely.
0:5:7|0:5:14|[Song Lao'er] sat in the back seat of [Qian Guixing]'s car, watching as the two friends slowly drove away. He turned around, deep in thought, reflecting on their conversation just now.
0:5:20|0:5:29|[Song Tao] just skillfully tightened the screws without answering. The scene shifted to the police station, where Lan stared at [Song Lao'er], who turned to look at the crying Lan.
0:5:29|0:5:47|Police Liu across the street looked him up and down, Song Lao'er glanced around, looked at Police Liu in front of him, blinked a few times, and the police officer across the street asked. Song Lao'er crossed his hands, answered carefully, and raised his eyebrows.
0:6:35|0:6:44|Lan Jie pointed at [Song Lao'er] and cried, while [Police Liu] looked at the two of them.
0:6:44|0:6:52|[Song Lao'er] turned around to look at [Police Liu] and another police officer, with an expression of disbelief on his face. His face twisted into a frown, and he then said to Lanjie,
0:7:41|0:7:48|[Song Lao'er] also overturned the table and sat at the door. Upon hearing the commotion, [Qian Guixing] quickly got up and walked into the courtyard. Many villagers outside the door also gathered around to see what was happening.
0:7:48|0:7:56|The scene changes, Police Liu opens the door of the detention room, Song Lao'er suddenly looks outside, Police Liu sighs.
0:8:52|0:9:10|[Song Lao'er] looked ahead in contemplation. The scene shifted, showing a man in black riding a motorcycle following behind [Song Lao'er]'s car. Inside the car, [Song Lao'er] glanced at his displeased son. In the noodle shop, several old men were discussing the cause of Cat Brother's death.
0:9:59|0:10:7|The old man looked at the furious Song Tao with some surprise. Song Lao'er broke the silence inside and outside the door, Song Tao did not move, and Song Lao'er slapped his son hard.
0:10:7|0:10:13|The old men in the noodle shop glanced at each other, and [Song Lao'er] looked at them before leaving with his son.
0:10:19|0:10:36|Grandpa pointed in the direction where the two people were leaving. Looking from the inside of the auto repair shop, [Song Lao'er] who was fixing a tire gradually stopped his work and looked over. [Song Tao] was staring straight at [Qian Guixing] sitting on a motorcycle by the roadside, pursing his lips and squinting without moving. [Song Lao'er] walked over to take a look at [Qian Guixing], then slowly turned his head to look at his son. [Song Tao] angrily went back into the house.
0:10:36|0:10:45|[Song Lao'er] turned his head to look at him. Looking from [Song Lao'er]'s direction, the man in black who was leaning on the motorcycle uncomfortably sat up and put the cigarette in his mouth to smoke.
0:10:45|0:10:53|Two people faced each other across the steps and a few steps away. The man in black on a motorcycle kept a certain distance, following behind [Song Lao'er]'s car.
0:10:59|0:11:5|Song Lao'er's car arrived in the wilderness.
0:11:14|0:11:22|In an abandoned train carriage, [Song Lao'er], [Dong Xiaofeng], [Wang Youquan], [Yang Shuhua], [Xiao Ping], [Qian Guixing], and Police Liu were smoking and analyzing the situation.
0:12:11|0:12:18|Underneath the car, Police Liu is fixing the car. Police Liu climbs out from under the car, followed by Song Lao'er who also arrives at the back of the car.
0:12:40|0:12:45|Police Liu threw the tools to the police officer Xiao Chen, whose face was covered in oil stains.
0:12:54|0:13:2|[Song Lao'er] hunched over and watched as [Police Liu] left, then glanced at the police officer Xiao Chen. Outside, it was pouring rain, and people took shelter under [Song Lao'er]'s shed.
0:13:2|0:13:13|In the house, [Song Lao'er] scratched his head in distress, with his hands crossed in front of his chest, huddled on the stool, frowning tightly, until the rain gradually stopped and the people seeking shelter from the rain gradually left.
0:13:13|0:13:34|[Song Lao'er] suddenly saw a familiar motorcycle in a car leaving outside, so he quickly ran out of his hideout to chase after it. Driving the car, [Song Lao'er] was followed by a man in black who rode the motorcycle. Both of them drove into the desolate mountains. Suddenly, [Song Lao'er] stopped the car halfway, got off, and squatted in front of the car to inspect. As he turned his head, the man in black quickly hid behind a hill.
0:13:34|0:13:41|[Song Lao'er] stood up, walked to the car to continue inspecting, and as he stood up, the man in black hid again.
0:13:41|0:13:46|[Song Lao'er] bent over, reached into his pocket, and scattered a bunch of nails on the ground.
0:13:46|0:13:55|The man in black watched as [Song Lao'er] got into the car, then carefully hid back behind the mountain next to the ditch. [Song Lao'er] drove away, raising a cloud of dust.
0:13:56|0:14:5|After driving a distance, the man in black on a motorcycle caught up, only to be knocked down by the nails thrown by [Song Lao'er], and plunged into a ditch, screaming in agony.
0:14:5|0:14:19|[Song Lao'er] occasionally got off the car to check the tire tracks on the ground, tracing the marks left by the motorcycle all the way, determined to find that motorcycle. Finally, under the sunlight, the car was parked at a corner.
0:14:19|0:14:26|At the village entrance, the old people and children looked at the unfamiliar vehicle parked in front of them, and arrived at Shitou Village.
0:14:27|0:14:34|Several villagers sitting by the roadside saw [Song Lao'er] looking around, so they asked. [Song Lao'er] walked around looking for traces of a motorcycle.
0:14:34|0:14:38|Through the door frame, it can be seen that the two people in the distance are not the ones they were looking for.
0:14:38|0:14:46|Along the village's small road, [Song Lao'er] continued to search from house to house, not missing any place within sight. Suddenly, his eyes lit up.
0:14:46|0:14:59|The expressions on their faces changed, staring fixedly at a spot below the slope, exhaling a big breath of white air. [Song Lao'er] used both hands and feet, carefully climbing onto the roof of a mud house, trying hard to see more clearly.
0:14:59|0:15:7|[Song Lao'er] crouched on the roof of the tile house, looking forward along a parked motorcycle, and could see [Song Lao'er] crouching on the roof.
0:15:8|0:15:15|[Song Lao'er] came down from the roof and quickly found a haystack to hide behind, sitting on the ground with his back against the haystack, trying to calm his breathing.
0:15:16|0:15:24|He took two breaths, leaned over and looked down. From this height, he could see the movements of the villagers below, with everyone on the road in full view.
0:15:25|0:15:32|[Song Lao'er] took out his phone and dialed a number, preparing to call for reinforcements.
0:15:47|0:16:4|[Police Liu] is taking down information from the suspect with his colleagues. [Police Liu] clicks his tongue and looks at Xiao Chen who is coming to report.
0:16:20|0:16:37|The suspect walked over obediently, and from the moving car, a group of workers riding motorcycles and shouting could be seen. The workers were holding weapons in their hands. [Police Liu] looked at the group of workers, then glanced at Xiao Chen who was driving. The police car that was originally behind the motorcycle group then accelerated.
0:16:37|0:16:44|The workers raised shovels and sticks, and a number of motorcycles kicked up dust.
0:16:44|0:16:51|The police car gradually drove to the front of the motorcycle team and honked to signal.
0:16:52|0:16:58|With his fellow workers, [He Qingyong] observed the police car through sunglasses, and Police Liu in the car also noticed the passing [He Qingyong].
0:16:58|0:17:2|[He Qingyong] frowned and watched [Police Liu] with his fellow workers. [Police Liu] said to Xiao Chen.
0:17:4|0:17:12|The police car blocked the motorcycle team, and the leading motorcycles crashed into the police car, causing the team to stop. On the other side, [Song Lao'er] gestured with a stick.
0:17:12|0:17:19|Waiting for his brother to come and help, [Song Lao'er] swung hard, the stick broke, and then he continued to gesture, unexpectedly hitting his own leg.
0:17:30|0:17:37|[Song Lao'er] looked at the two people talking in the courtyard, slightly moved down a bit, and turned around with a stick in hand.
0:17:37|0:17:45|Seeing the people in the courtyard about to ride away on a motorcycle, [Song Lao'er] tightened the stick in his hand.
0:17:47|0:18:1|Running down the slope, the stick dragged on the ground making a sound. [Song Lao'er] jumped down to a lower path and quickly walked towards the person pushing the motorcycle.
0:18:13|0:18:22|[Song Lao'er] threw the stick out, the blond man fell on the firewood when jumping to the next level of the road, and just as the blond man was about to jump to the next level, [Song Lao'er] followed and extended a foot.
0:18:22|0:18:33|The blond man stumbled, causing [Song Lao'er] to fall to the ground as well. After getting up, he collided with the blond man who realized that the path ahead was a dead end and turned back, and the two of them ran desperately on the narrow path.
0:18:47|0:18:55|Both sides were panting heavily, with [Song Lao'er] anxiously trying to chase the man with blonde hair, but he was surrounded by villagers and couldn't chase him anymore.
0:19:15|0:19:22|In the struggle, a net was thrown over [Song Lao'er], and the villagers completely controlled [Song Lao'er].
0:19:22|0:19:27|The police car gradually drove into the entrance of Shizhuo Village, with the village chief waving to the car to move forward.
0:19:30|0:19:37|The police car stopped next to [Song Lao'er]'s car, and through the window of [Song Lao'er]'s car, you could see him tied to a tree with villagers surrounding him.
0:19:42|0:19:48|The villagers explained to Police Liu, who noticed that next to him was Song Lao'er's car. Song Lao'er had a radish stuffed in his mouth, unable to speak, only able to hum.
0:19:59|0:20:7|Police Liu said to the village chief:
0:20:32|0:20:41|The village chief looked at the two police officers and pointed to the back, then arrived at the courtyard of [Wang Youquan]'s house. [Song Lao'er] was observing at the gate, [Police Liu] walked out of the door, [Song Lao'er] quickly took a few steps back, [Police Liu] put on his hat, and the village chief followed him.
0:20:41|0:20:48|The village chief followed behind him.
0:21:9|0:21:24|[Song Lao'er] pointed to the sticker on the motorcycle for [Police Liu] to see. [Police Liu] kicked the motorcycle stand against the pillar, and Xiao Chen handed over a photo. [Song Lao'er] quickly leaned in, then quickly pulled back. [Police Liu] flipped the photo over, revealing a message saying "Yang Shuhua's 20th birthday celebration," with a photo of [Wang Youquan] and [Yang Shuhua] on the other side.
0:21:34|0:21:40|The village chief asked the villagers, and the village chief looked as Police Liu pointed towards the field.
0:21:51|0:21:58|At the entrance of the village, [He Qingyong] arrived with his fellow workers. Following the shouting, everyone looked towards the motorcycle team. [He Qingyong] was in the front and slowly stopped the motorcycle.
0:22:2|0:22:9|Upon seeing his belated brother, [Song Lao'er] turned his back towards the police car. [Police Liu] went up to check the convoy, then glanced at [Song Lao'er].
0:22:9|0:22:21|[Song Lao'er] didn't dare to make eye contact with him, quickly turned his head. [Police Liu] naturally understood what was going on, patted [He Qingyong] and asked. [He Qingyong] nodded with a smile and then shook his head after some thought.
0:22:22|0:22:29|Police Liu immediately put down the corners of his mouth and came to the courtyard of He Qingyong, where a group of brothers were having a good time, with women picking vegetables and serving dishes.
0:22:33|0:22:39|Two people clenched their fists, while [Song Lao'er] sat at another table eating. His good buddy [He Qingyong] sat down and patted his arm, saying,
0:22:48|0:22:55|[Song Lao'er] finished his drink and [He Qingyong] pointed at him, saying,
0:24:11|0:24:30|[Qian Guixing] has already gotten on the motorcycle, [Song Lao'er] exclaimed: "It's already daytime," [Song Lao'er] is tidying up the car, [He Qingyong] came over with his colleague Xiao Jun, [Song Lao'er] is throwing away the waste bags on the car, took a glance at the newcomers, and continued unloading things.
0:24:37|0:24:46|[He Qingyong] sat in the passenger seat, Xiaojun found a place to sit in the back of the car, [Song Lao'er] started the car, and [He Qingyong]'s motorcycle was left directly at the repair shop's door.
0:24:46|0:24:52|Only [Song Lao'er] knew where the three of them were going.
0:25:19|0:25:27|He Qingyong still jumped into the pigsty to help, Xiao Jun opened the pigsty door to help as well, Wang Youquan's mother hit Xiao Jun's helmet, and the pigs were struggling hard.
0:25:36|0:25:42|Two women rushed over upon hearing the noise, one pulling Wang Youquan's mother and the other dragging Song Lao'er, but it was of no avail.
0:25:42|0:25:52|In the car, [He Qingyong] looked at [Song Lao'er], unsure if it took a lot of effort to pull the pig or to calm down his anger. [Song Lao'er] took a deep breath, while Xiao Jun was still sweating and pulling the pig at the back of the car. Suddenly, [He Qingyong] spoke:
0:26:1|0:26:6|[Song Lao'er] stepped on the brake, both of them leaned forward, [He Qingyong] opened the car door and got out, [He Qingyong] forcefully closed the car door and said to Xiao Jun:
0:26:11|0:26:35|After saying goodbye to [He Qingyong], they walked forward. Xiao Jun glanced at Song Lao'er in the car, still puzzled. Song Lao'er looked at the two of them, hands on the steering wheel, frowning. He puffed his cheeks, took a deep breath, started the car, caught up with the two who had not gone far, and asked, "He Xin Yong, without even looking at Song Lao'er, Song Lao'er pursed his lips, turned around, and repeated:
0:26:37|0:26:40|[He Qingyong] finally glanced at [Song Lao'er], but still didn't say anything.
0:26:42|0:26:47|[Song Lao'er] stepped on the gas pedal, glanced back, and soon left the other two behind as he drove into the desolate mountain valley.
0:26:47|0:26:55|The clouds swiftly drifted by as Song Lao'er's car moved further and further away from the two pedestrians. Song Lao'er nodded to the boss as he took the money from selling pigs and counted it while walking.
0:27:8|0:27:17|He walked while entangling the pig-catching net, then tucked the net under his arm. In the narrow alley crowded with pedestrians, the sound of car horns kept ringing.
0:27:17|0:27:24|[Song Lao'er] was busy for a while, his steps slightly heavy. [Song Lao'er] turned into a downhill road, walking along.
0:27:24|0:27:33|It feels like someone is following him. [Song Lao'er] turns his head while walking, but finds no one suspicious. He takes a few more steps.
0:27:33|0:27:47|He leaned in slightly, with villagers carrying firewood behind him, people standing at their doorsteps, and a yellow dog of unknown origin. [Song Lao'er] kept walking, occasionally looking back to see if anyone was following him.
0:27:48|0:27:55|At a T-junction, [Song Lao'er] turned around again, only to see an old man carrying straw and leading a cow.
0:27:55|0:28:3|With a few villagers, [Song Lao'er] turned around again, only to see the old man leading the cow. [Song Lao'er] blinked his eyes.
0:28:4|0:28:21|The camera moves behind the straw, and from this angle, we can see [Song Lao'er]. [Song Lao'er] walks onto a narrow path, first slightly turning his face to the side, then suddenly turning around. He stops in place, using his eyes to search, but there is still no one around.
0:28:22|0:28:37|He could only turn around and continue walking, but after a few steps, he suddenly turned back with such force that he almost lost his balance. He reached out to steady himself against the stone wall beside him.
0:28:37|0:28:44|[Song Lao'er] had barely taken a few steps when a cell phone ringtone sounded. Startled, he turned around, this time walking towards the direction of the ringtone.
0:28:45|0:29:2|With eyes wide open, mouth slightly agape, and neck leaning forward, [Song Lao'er] looked towards the door where the bell sound came from. However, the door was closed, with only two door gods paintings and an unlocked door lock swaying in the wind. [Song Lao'er] cautiously approached the door, squinted and looked inside, but not finding anyone, he continued walking forward.
0:29:2|0:29:10|Holding a pig-catching net in hand, [Song Lao'er] walked while keeping an eye on the rear. Finally, he saw his car parked at the intersection, lowered his head, and relaxed a bit.
0:29:11|0:29:21|He couldn't figure it out, so he walked towards the car parked in the sunlight. The car was parked at the intersection between the field and the village, with neatly stacked straw piles next to it. Before he reached the car,
0:29:21|0:29:32|[Song Lao'er] threw the pig-catching net up, then walked a few steps to the car door, took out the key from his pocket, suddenly a hand appeared behind [Song Lao'er] and patted him on the back, which startled him.
0:29:39|0:29:46|[Song Lao'er] looked him up and down, furrowed his brow and took a deep breath.
0:29:46|0:29:53|Maodou smiled with his mouth open, waiting for [Song Lao'er] to respond. Finally, [Song Lao'er] said:
0:29:58|0:30:3|[Song Lao'er] took another look at Maodou, squinting his eyes. Maodou licked his lips and glanced to the side.
0:30:9|0:30:14|Song Lao'er's pupils dilated slightly as he looked at Miao Dou with his head tilted. Turning to Cat Brother's house, a Taoist priest was performing a ritual.
0:30:52|0:30:58|[Song Lao'er] entered the door while taking out the money for selling pigs from his pocket, accidentally spilling it on the ground.
0:31:5|0:31:17|[Song Lao'er] turned and walked away. On the road to and from the county town, a large truck quickly passed by, in contrast to [Song Lao'er]'s car, passing through the sparse trees by the road, gradually moving away from the village.
0:31:17|0:31:40|On the rooftop, [Song Lao'er] watched as [Wang Youquan]'s girlfriend [Yang Shuhua] was hanging clothes. [Yang Shuhua] sniffed, wiped her eyes, then wiped her whole face with the back of her hand. She looked at [Song Lao'er] and said, tossing a crumpled paper ball to him. [Song Lao'er] tripped on the loose clothesline, then unfolded the crumpled paper.
0:31:51|0:32:2|After speaking, [Yang Shuhua] continued to hang up the laundry. [Yang Shuhua] patted the sheets hanging to dry, then bent down to pick up other things to hang, while [Song Lao'er] blinked and turned his head.
0:32:2|0:32:10|[Yang Shuhua] twisted the water towards [Song Lao'er], who quickly dodged his feet. [Yang Shuhua] raised her hand to air it out.
0:32:22|0:32:30|[Yang Shuhua] turned around to pat the pillowcase, and [Song Lao'er], who was originally bending over, stood up straight and looked at [Yang Shuhua], moving his mouth.
0:32:30|0:32:36|Yang Shuhua couldn't find the words to say and could only choose to leave. She watched Song Lao'er walk away and breathed a sigh of relief.
0:32:36|0:32:41|[Song Lao'er] walked down the stairs, passing by two security guards who were moving a car. [Song Lao'er] walked quickly, breathing heavily with each step.
0:32:43|0:32:50|As he just came down from the rooftop, a large rock fell down, and [Song Lao'er] was walking right underneath where the rock fell.
0:33:36|0:33:42|[Yang Shuhua] looked at [Wang Youquan] askance, with her hands gripping [Wang Youquan]'s shoulders.
0:33:42|0:33:50|She leaned against him. The two of them went from the winding road in the mountains to the roller skating rink.
0:33:50|0:33:53|[Wang Youquan] held hands with [Yang Shuhua] and skated on rollerblades.
0:33:54|0:34:1|[Wang Youquan] deliberately tripped them both, causing them to fall to the ground. [Yang Shuhua] sat on a chair, nibbling her nails to rest. [Wang Youquan] called out to her:
0:34:5|0:34:12|[Yang Shuhua] sat on the chair, laughing happily, she shook her legs and looked around. On the rooftop late at night,
0:34:12|0:34:21|[Yang Shuhua] is wearing slippers, a military coat, holding a blanket, and stepping over the iron frame on the rooftop. Under the military coat, she has already changed into pajama shorts.
0:34:23|0:34:32|[Yang Shuhua], petite in stature, walked with a large blanket in her arms and turned the corner of the wall, where she saw [Wang Youquan] pulling a mattress outside.
0:34:33|0:34:39|He squeezed through the iron wires and arrived behind [Wang Youquan], then kicked him in the butt.
0:35:7|0:35:22|[Yang Shuhua] was pulled into the arms by [Wang Youquan], who then kissed her fiercely. While kissing, [Wang Youquan] also took off [Yang Shuhua]'s military coat. [Yang Shuhua] stopped resisting and hugged [Wang Youquan]'s neck. [Wang Youquan] kissed [Yang Shuhua] a few more times, looking at her.
0:35:39|0:35:44|[Yang Shuhua] touched her boyfriend's face, looking at him with concern. In the daytime, [Wang Youquan] rode a motorcycle on the highway.
0:35:44|0:35:52|Swinging and swaying, [Song Lao'er] rode his motorcycle back to the village from the county town. The densely packed residential buildings of the town were getting farther and farther behind him as a heavy rain began to fall.
0:35:53|0:36:8|[Wang Youquan] parked the car on the side, quickly put down the car support, pressed the key on the front of the car and held it in his hand, covered his head with his hand, and hid under the shed of [Song Lao'er]'s repair shop. It was the day when [Song Lao'er] was sitting in the shop daydreaming. Gradually, people walked out of the shed.
0:36:9|0:36:14|[Wang Youquan] looked at the people around him, then glanced at the rain, reached out his hand to feel it, and checked how heavy the rain was.
0:36:14|0:36:24|[Wang Youquan] pushed the motorcycle to turn around, ready to leave. He started the motorcycle, and at this moment, [Song Lao'er] noticed the familiar motorcycle rushing out of the house and quickly ran to drive.
0:36:33|0:36:39|Riding a motorcycle, [Wang Youquan] returned home while talking on the phone, carrying a bucket of slops into the yard.
0:36:46|0:37:10|After hanging up the phone, [Wang Youquan] put the leftover radish in his mouth, held onto the front of the motorcycle with one hand and the back with the other, turned the motorcycle around, pushed it out of the door with the radish in his mouth. He saw [Song Lao'er] coming down from a high place. He got on the motorcycle and tried to start it, while [Song Lao'er] behind him was carrying a stick and shouting that the motorcycle wouldn't start. [Wang Youquan] then leaned the motorcycle against a utility pole and took off the radish mixed with saliva.
0:37:14|0:37:37|[Wang Youquan] ran desperately, while the village chief and his men stopped [Song Lao'er]. [Wang Youquan] kept running hard, looking back to see if [Song Lao'er] was following. He spotted a small path on the side of the road, quickly stopped running, and dove into a pile of grass in someone's yard. As [Wang Youquan] lay on the grass, he heard a noise.
0:38:11|0:38:31|[Song Lao'er][Police Liu] and the village chief walked away, [Wang Youquan] sat on a pile of grass, looking in the direction of the bird's chirping, lost in thought. [Wang Youquan] walked on the road, flipping off the sticky weeds on his body. Behind him was a tricycle carrying firewood. As [Wang Youquan] jumped to shake off the weeds on his body, the tricycle came close to him and almost knocked him down with the protruding firewood. He quickly blocked his head and turned around.
0:38:31|0:38:46|Then he ran a few steps and climbed onto this tricycle, sitting skillfully at the back of the tricycle. [Wang Youquan] then came to the county town to find [Yang Shuhua], passing by two girls in work clothes, one limping and the other hobbling. When he reached the middle of two cars, he collided head-on with someone.
0:38:47|0:38:54|[Wang Youquan] angrily said a word, the person was hit on the nose, covering his nose and turning to look at [Wang Youquan], [Wang Youquan] touched his face that was hit, took a step up several steps and walked upstairs.
0:39:0|0:39:8|[Wang Youquan] pulled the railing and looked around. When he heard the sound of water from the water room, he walked over. [Wang Youquan] immediately bounced up when he stepped on the water, and he crossed over the puddle to turn off the faucet. [Yang Shuhua] glanced at [Wang Youquan].
0:39:30|0:39:37|[Wang Youquan] turned on the tap to wash his face, splashed it twice, then glanced at [Yang Shuhua], splashed it again, and looked at her once more.
0:39:38|0:39:45|[Yang Shuhua] was rubbing the clothes, and [Wang Youquan] leaned in to take a closer look, tears still visible on [Yang Shuhua]'s face.
0:40:0|0:40:18|[Wang Youquan] moved his eyes up and down, not daring to move, [Yang Shuhua] sniffed and glanced at [Wang Youquan]. [Wang Youquan] avoided eye contact, wiped the water off his face, [Yang Shuhua] looked at him, took a deep breath, cleared his nose, and finally spoke: [Wang Youquan] moved his mouth, and what he finally said was,
0:40:24|0:40:37|[Yang Shuhua] looked at him, [Wang Youquan] cautiously raised his eyes to look at [Yang Shuhua], [Yang Shuhua] trembled slightly and opened her mouth, but didn't say anything, a tear fell down first.
0:40:45|0:40:48|[Yang Shuhua] shook her hand. At the station, [Wang Youquan] took out a few 100 yuan bills and handed them to the ticket seller.
0:40:48|0:40:55|[Yang Shuhua] waited for him at the back, [Wang Youquan] leaned on the railing, watching the ticket seller issue tickets, licked his lips, and then turned to glance at [Yang Shuhua].
0:40:55|0:41:4|[Yang Shuhua] also looked at him and smiled. [Wang Youquan] responded with a smile, turned his head to face the ticket seller, and bought the tickets. After buying the tickets, [Wang Youquan] hugged [Yang Shuhua] while looking at his phone. Suddenly, [Yang Shuhua] stopped.
0:41:6|0:41:17|[Wang Youquan] looked at [Yang Shuhua] who suddenly stopped, then glanced at the car. [Yang Shuhua] looked up at [Wang Youquan], forced a smile, and then lowered her head. [Wang Youquan] looked at the car again, licked his lips, and turned his head.
0:41:17|0:41:29|Looking at [Yang Shuhua] with a strange expression, [Yang Shuhua] asked, looking to the side with her head lowered even more. [Wang Youquan] glanced at [Yang Shuhua] as if wanting to speak, but [Yang Shuhua] remained silent with her head still lowered.
0:41:29|0:41:48|[Wang Youquan] turned his head to look at the car again, [Yang Shuhua] lifted her head and flicked her hair, staring at [Wang Youquan]. [Wang Youquan] met [Yang Shuhua]'s gaze, and [Yang Shuhua]'s eyes flickered. She took a step forward and asked, trembling slightly, her mouth open but no words coming out.
0:41:58|0:42:5|[Yang Shuhua] fiddled with her hair, wiped away tears with her hand. [Wang Youquan] pursed his lips, his eyes wandering up and down, raised his hand and rubbed [Yang Shuhua]'s shoulder, [Yang Shuhua] took a deep breath.
0:42:25|0:42:33|[Wang Youquan] approached [Yang Shuhua] and hugged her.
0:42:34|0:42:41|[Yang Shuhua] lowered her head, bit her lower lip, tears welling up in her eyes. She quickly raised her head and looked around.
0:42:50|0:42:57|[Yang Shuhua] nodded with her lower lip bitten.
0:42:57|0:43:8|[Wang Youquan] stuffed the ticket into his back pocket and hurried towards the car, causing tears to fall from [Yang Shuhua]'s eyes. She bit her lip, unable to control the trembling, and finally watched him board the car as he walked away.
0:43:27|0:43:33|[Wang Youquan] sat in the car, talking on the phone with [Yang Shuhua].
0:43:45|0:43:51|[Wang Youquan] lowered his voice and asked:
0:44:22|0:44:35|[Wang Youquan] hung up the phone, glanced at the person next to him, and walked towards the front of the bus. The bus from Shuicheng to Kunming had stopped by the roadside. By the time he turned around, [Wang Youquan] was already eating noodles at a roadside stall. [Yang Shuhua] sat next to him, dialing [Song Lao'er]'s phone number.
0:44:36|0:44:43|[Wang Youquan] took a big bite of noodles and asked while eating:
0:45:31|0:45:38|[Wang Youquan] took another big bite of noodles.
0:46:1|0:46:10|[Wang Youquan] bit off a piece of bread, ate a potato chip, chewed it loudly, and walked to the roller skating rink. [Song Lao'er] sat on a chair, [Wang Youquan] stood up, and [Song Lao'er] turned slightly towards [Wang Youquan].
0:47:20|0:47:34|[Wang Youquan] jumped over with his hands on the crossbar, while [Song Lao'er] kept his mouth shut and lowered his head. Unexpectedly, when [Wang Youquan] reached the door, he turned back. [Song Lao'er] quickly lifted his head, and after thinking for a moment, [Wang Youquan] crawled back under the crossbar.
0:47:34|0:47:40|He put both hands in his pockets and walked over, saying, "[Song Lao'er]" blinked a few times.
0:47:41|0:47:46|In the wilderness, [Song Lao'er] returned the money from the pig robbery to [Wang Youquan], who sat on a rock happily counting the money.
0:47:46|0:47:55|[Song Lao'er] rummaged through abandoned items for evidence, [Wang Youquan] reminded [Song Lao'er] about the money, [Song Lao'er] turned around, and [Wang Youquan] pointed to the plastic bag nearby.
0:47:55|0:48:3|[Song Lao'er] bent down to pick it up and wrapped it around his own hands, winding it a few times. [Wang Youquan] counted the money again, while [Song Lao'er] carefully searched through it.
0:48:3|0:48:18|[Wang Youquan] lifted the money up to the sky for confirmation, [Song Lao'er] took out a bunch of keys from a pocket of a white suit, identifying the English on them. [Wang Youquan] also looked at the keys upon hearing the sound, and [Song Lao'er] looked at [Wang Youquan].
0:48:26|0:48:37|[Wang Youquan] moistened his fingers with saliva, [Song Lao'er] continued to search. [Song Lao'er] carefully opened the white suit, felt something in the pocket, and tried to take it out. When he took it out, he saw a bank passbook and several pieces of paper.
0:48:37|0:48:45|[Song Lao'er] turned over another page to confirm, separated a few things, while [Wang Youquan] was happily counting money. With his right hand wrapped in a plastic bag, [Song Lao'er] flipped open the passbook and read out the information on it.
0:49:5|0:49:20|[Song Lao'er] gathered the things he found together, looked around on the ground, and interrupted [Wang Youquan] who was counting money.
0:49:28|0:49:36|Wang Youquan glanced impatiently at Song Lao'er. On the rocky hill, Song Lao'er dug out something from a pile.
0:49:36|0:49:45|[Wang Youquan] leaned over, [Song Lao'er] took out a photo, [Wang Youquan] shifted his body slightly, accidentally flipping over a stone. [Song Lao'er] stared at the photo in his hand, stunned.
0:49:45|0:49:54|Without blinking, [Wang Youquan] got up, opened his mouth and endured the pain to look over. The photo in [Song Lao'er]'s hand turned out to be a blurry image of [Song Lao'er] himself. The third title appeared.
0:49:56|0:50:7|The mixed-breed, the scene shifts, a wallet with a photo of [Song Lao'er] on it, a few drops of water sprinkled on the photo. As the camera pans out and then in, it turns out to be [Dong Xiaofeng] struggling to do push-ups.
0:50:7|0:50:15|In between two narrow dormitory beds, [Dong Xiaofeng] in a shirt and trousers, with dumbbells in front of her, and a security guard watching the nightclub's surveillance camera to her left.
0:50:15|0:50:23|[Dong Xiaofeng] was covered in sweat, his whole face tense as he struggled to make another move.
0:50:24|0:50:32|[Dong Xiaofeng] couldn't hold on any longer, one hand let go, and she fell to the ground.
0:50:38|0:50:44|Wearing glasses, [Song Lao'er] arrived at the nightclub. He greeted his colleagues, whistled, and casually took the fruit from the tray his colleague was holding.
0:50:44|0:50:51|[Dong Xiaofeng] pushed the door open and walked into the room, where a woman was talking on the phone and heading to the restroom. The room was filled with women. When someone spotted [Dong Xiaofeng], they shouted,
0:50:53|0:51:4|[Xiao Ping] stuffed some food in her mouth, then squeezed past the sisters and walked over. As she walked, she clapped her hands. When [Dong Xiaofeng] saw [Xiao Ping], she walked towards the door. [Xiao Ping] hurried to catch up, and after going out, they looked outside and went to another private room.
0:51:5|0:51:11|[Xiao Ping] greeted [Dong Xiaofeng] to come in, [Dong Xiaofeng] closed the door, and [Xiao Ping] took off her coat.
0:51:31|0:51:40|[Xiao Ping] looked at [Dong Xiaofeng] inquiringly, [Dong Xiaofeng] moved her neck, and suddenly [Xiao Ping] stood up straight.
0:51:40|0:51:59|[Xiao Ping] covered her mouth in surprise, then shook [Dong Xiaofeng] and said, [Xiao Ping] pursed her lips and looked affectionately at [Dong Xiaofeng], then rushed up to kiss him.
0:51:59|0:52:8|[Dong Xiaofeng] hurried to leave, using her hands to hold [Xiao Ping]'s face, preventing her from getting closer. [Dong Xiaofeng] then raised the low collar of [Xiao Ping]'s clothes.
0:52:18|0:52:35|During the day, a red truck slowly approaches as [Dong Xiaofeng] walks in the same direction, and the truck gradually pulls over to the side of the road.
0:52:35|0:52:41|The slow-moving truck sound was followed by the sound of a motorcycle. Cat Brother rode his motorcycle to Song Lao'er's shop for repairs, but no one responded.
0:52:57|0:53:5|Brother Cat looked around, then walked out from the side door next to the main entrance. He glanced at the black gloves on his hands.
0:53:5|0:53:12|Walking to the shelf in the garage, [Song Lao'er] looked around. At this moment, wearing white trousers and sunglasses,
0:53:12|0:53:33|Dong Xiaofeng, in a white suit, looked at the big truck behind him and walked towards the repair shop. He took two slow steps and stopped, lifted his arm to pick up the suit jacket, took out a photo from his pocket, switched hands to hold the photo, and flipped up the lens of his sunglasses with the other hand. He looked at the photo, raised it from left to right to chest level half a meter away, and glanced at the repair shop again.
0:53:33|0:53:40|Continuing to walk forward, a large truck passed by next to her, followed by a white van. [Dong Xiaofeng] walked while putting the photo back into her pocket.
0:53:41|0:53:54|At this moment, Brother Cat had already taken tools to fix the motorcycle by himself. [Dong Xiaofeng] watched as Brother Cat walked over, glanced around, and then looked inside the repair shop. [Dong Xiaofeng] approached Brother Cat from behind, lowered her eyes to watch him, and picked up the collar of her white suit.
0:54:2|0:54:17|Turning around to look at the road, straightening up, and looking back at the path she had walked, [Dong Xiaofeng] glanced at "Cat Brother" who was still fixing the car. Putting on a white suit, she then ran her hand along her leg and felt her pocket. She clenched her hand, but there was no photo in her pocket.
0:54:17|0:54:34|[Dong Xiaofeng] pursed her lips and tilted her body to size up [Cat Brother], then took two small steps forward. Next, she moved closer to [Cat Brother] and propped her leg with one hand, bending her body to observe him. [Dong Xiaofeng] bent down even closer, startling [Cat Brother] who was crouching on the ground.
0:54:43|0:54:53|[Dong Xiaofeng] stood up straight, straightened his white suit on the street. After adjusting the collar of his suit, [Cat Brother] didn't stop what he was doing and glanced at [Dong Xiaofeng].
0:55:4|0:55:10|[Cat Brother] stopped what he was doing and looked at the street, asking:
0:55:21|0:55:26|[Song Lao'er] stood up and tried to start the motorcycle, the black exhaust dirtied [Dong Xiaofeng]'s trousers. [Dong Xiaofeng] looked down,
0:55:26|0:55:33|At that moment, [Song Lao'er] opened his mouth wide, but [Cat Brother] laughed and turned off the motorcycle engine. [Dong Xiaofeng] opened her mouth and looked up.
0:55:40|0:55:46|[Dong Xiaofeng] lifted her leg to look at her pants, while [Cat Brother] picked up the black gloves placed aside and put them on.
0:56:7|0:56:27|In the wilderness, [Song Lao'er] rode a motorcycle with [Dong Xiaofeng], stopping at the Wash Line Ditch. When [Dong Xiaofeng] got off, a dagger fell to the ground. She looked down, took a step back, picked up the dagger, and lightly tossed it up, catching it by the blade. [Song Lao'er] nervously watched as [Dong Xiaofeng] touched the blade.
0:56:33|0:56:40|[Song Lao'er] glanced at [Dong Xiaofeng], took the dagger and examined it in his hand. The reflection of the dagger shone on [Song Lao'er]'s face, and he handed it to [Dong Xiaofeng].
0:56:43|0:56:50|[Dong Xiaofeng] smiled as she took the dagger, lifted her suit and stuffed it into her belt. She looked down and saw the oil stains on her pants, then took off the suit.
0:56:51|0:57:0|Adjusted and placed it on the motorcycle. After getting off the car, [Song Lao'er] saw,
0:57:2|0:57:8|[Song Lao'er] glanced at the motorcycle and looked around, catching up with [Dong Xiaofeng] who was already going downhill. [Song Lao'er] picked up his pants while going downhill.
0:57:16|0:57:29|[Song Lao'er] turned to look at [Dong Xiaofeng]. After a pause, [Dong Xiaofeng] asked, "Finished?" Upon hearing this, [Song Lao'er] chuckled at [Dong Xiaofeng], but [Dong Xiaofeng] did not laugh; instead, she spat.
0:57:51|0:58:1|[Dong Xiaofeng] pulled up the zipper, gesturing with both hands a length of half a meter, while [Song Lao'er]'s hand holding the cigarette was shaking a bit.
0:58:17|0:58:24|[Dong Xiaofeng] also leaned in and asked, [Song Lao'er]’s face changed, tremblingly smiled, turned around and said,
0:58:26|0:58:40|[Dong Xiaofeng] immediately pulled out a dagger and stabbed towards the back of [Song Lao'er]. One stab was not enough, so she followed up with another one. Through the bridge tunnel, [Song Lao'er] could be seen weakly raising one hand to touch his back, while [Dong Xiaofeng] withdrew the knife and stepped back. [Song Lao'er] could only fall backwards, shocked to see the hand that was pulled back from behind, covered in bright red blood.
0:58:50|0:58:59|[Song Lao'er] lunged at [Dong Xiaofeng], who dodged. [Song Lao'er] ran while holding his back and looking back, as [Dong Xiaofeng] caught up and struck at [Song Lao'er]'s head with a dagger, knocking him to the ground.
0:58:59|0:59:9|[Dong Xiaofeng] quickly looked around to see if there was anyone on the road, then followed [Song Lao'er], who could no longer run, and kicked him from behind. [Song Lao'er] fell to the ground, blood from his back splattered on the weeds.
0:59:9|0:59:16|[Song Lao'er] tried to get up and run, but [Dong Xiaofeng] kicked him again. [Song Lao'er] was almost coughing up blood as he crawled forward.
0:59:16|0:59:24|[Dong Xiaofeng] stabbed the dagger into the ground in front of [Song Lao'er],
0:59:45|1:0:8|[Dong Xiaofeng] placed her hand on Cat Brother's scapula, pressed down hard, stood up with a dagger in hand, turned to Xiao Xi and asked, then turned back, lightly tossed the knife towards Cat Brother, straddled him, and then stabbed him hard with the dagger, the blood on the dagger deepened, raised both hands over her head and stabbed at the same spot, Cat Brother groaned.
1:0:8|1:0:21|[Dong Xiaofeng] also made another cut, and Cat Brother's hands, covered in weeds, opened up. [Dong Xiaofeng] was panting, blood continuously sliding down the blade. She stood up from Cat Brother's back, and Cat Brother's hands stopped struggling.
1:0:24|1:0:32|[Dong Xiaofeng] threw away the dagger held between her tiger's mouth and thumb, looked at her hand, then at her pants, took out her phone from the pocket, but failed to catch it and threw the phone away.
1:0:32|1:0:45|Hastily took two steps forward to pick up the phone, took a photo of Cat Brother from the front, then took another one from the right side, and finally skipped over Cat Brother to take another photo from his left side. Quickly put away the phone, looked around to make sure no one was nearby, then leaned against Cat Brother's right side and flipped it over.
1:0:45|1:1:5|Cat Brother's face was covered in blood and grass, [Dong Xiaofeng] knelt on the ground, looking at Cat Brother's face, feeling the pockets on his body. There was still snow in the mountain valley, [Dong Xiaofeng] searched for the dead person under the hot sun. Finally, she took out a cellphone and a wallet from Cat Brother's pocket, put the cellphone in her mouth, picked up the discarded dagger next to her, spat out the cellphone from her mouth, walked to the west, and first dropped the dagger.
1:1:5|1:1:11|Threw the phone in again, rummaged through the wallet, took out the money and stuffed it into his pocket, then threw the wallet into the stream.
1:1:11|1:1:18|Picking up the dagger from the ground, [Song Lao'er] took two steps forward but almost slipped, then stepped back, leaning against the stream, and used the stream water to clean the dagger.
1:1:34|1:1:45|Hiding behind the stone where the dagger was thrown, [Dong Xiaofeng] gasped and adjusted her sunglasses with her hand, secretly observing. [Dong Xiaofeng] cautiously peeked out and saw someone in the distance walking onto the road. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be [Wang Youquan] standing on the road, looking around.
1:1:45|1:1:58|[Song Lao'er] noticed that [Wang Youquan] didn't pay attention to himself. [Dong Xiaofeng] leaned against a rock and sighed. She saw [Wang Youquan] slowly walking towards the motorcycle, touching his head, and putting on a hat while looking back. [Dong Xiaofeng] tilted her head and paid attention.
1:1:58|1:2:20|[Wang Youquan] walked to the motorcycle and whistled, then he looked around to see if anyone was nearby. Quickly, he moved towards the motorcycle, grabbed the handle, and swiftly mounted the motorcycle. [Dong Xiaofeng] put both hands on the rock and exclaimed in surprise. [Wang Youquan] started the motorcycle, and it began to move.
1:2:21|1:2:26|[Wang Youquan] took a glance, then quickly rode away on his motorcycle, while [Dong Xiaofeng] was still crawling up the small slope beside the road.
1:2:28|1:2:34|[Wang Youquan] is riding away on a motorcycle. [Dong Xiaofeng] is hoarse as she shouts and stomps her feet in place.
1:2:38|1:2:42|Heading towards [Wang Youquan] and cursing. [Dong Xiaofeng] wearing an old cotton coat, arrived at the tea house.
1:2:43|1:2:59|Walking while brushing off the dust on his body, Song Lao'er took off his old cotton coat and threw it on the grass mat. He rolled up his shirt sleeves as he walked, tilting his head to look around, and headed towards a room with a half-open door. Dong Xiaofeng pushed the door open, and Qian Guixing, who was playing cards inside, turned his head. The other man playing cards also looked at Dong Xiaofeng.
1:2:59|1:3:7|[Qian Guixing] and the man in the middle gestured for Xiao Mei to go out for tea, then the three looked at [Dong Xiaofeng]. [Qian Guixing] put down his cards and stood up, walking over to look at [Dong Xiaofeng].
1:3:7|1:3:15|[Dong Xiaofeng] nodded, reached into her pocket, [Qian Guixing] turned to look, [Dong Xiaofeng] had already taken out her phone, and [Qian Guixing] also focused on the phone.
1:3:16|1:3:23|[Dong Xiaofeng] handed the photos to [Qian Guixing], swiped the phone a few times, all were photos of Cat Brother's body, and then handed the phone back to [Dong Xiaofeng].
1:3:23|1:3:31|[Dong Xiaofeng] looked up at [Qian Guixing], their eyes met. [Qian Guixing] slightly turned his face, licked his lips and asked:
1:3:36|1:3:57|The man with his back turned around, and when he faced [Qian Guixing], [Qian Guixing] turned his head back, with [Dong Xiaofeng] also looking at him. The man gestured, and the man who was still sitting stood up, holding a cloth bag and placing it on the mahjong table. [Dong Xiaofeng] walked to the table, gently opened the bag, revealing several stacks of hundred yuan bills. After closing the bag, she picked it up, spun it around, and was about to leave.
1:4:0|1:4:4|[Qian Guixing] covered his mouth and said. [Dong Xiaofeng] awkwardly retracted her outstretched hand, put it in her pocket, and then left.
1:4:4|1:4:21|[Dong Xiaofeng] quickly ran down the stairs after leaving the house, unbuttoning the buttons on her shirt as she went. With one hand holding an old cotton coat and the other carrying a cloth bag, she stuffed the bag into her shirt and draped the old cotton coat over herself. As she walked out of the alley, she glanced back, then pulled the coat over the bag in her arms, took a few steps forward, and looked around.
1:4:51|1:4:54|[Dong Xiaofeng] smiled and watched as the young man started the car.
1:4:58|1:5:11|In a blink of an eye, [Dong Xiaofeng] has ridden a motorcycle to the road in the wilderness. The motorcycle passes by the ditch where he killed Cat Brother, and Cat Brother's body is still lying there, with pale lips, a bloodless face, covered in bloodstains and weeds.
1:5:11|1:5:16|[Dong Xiaofeng] drove through the swirling dust, standing up to see where she was heading.
1:5:16|1:5:24|Riding a motorcycle and gnawing on sugarcane from an unknown source, [Dong Xiaofeng] arrived at an intersection and stopped by kicking her foot.
1:5:24|1:5:32|He looked to both sides, chose one side to ride towards, and drove into the small path of Shitouzhai. [Dong Xiaofeng] had just passed a T-junction.
1:5:32|1:5:39|[Wang Youquan] rode past on Cat Brother's motorcycle. [Dong Xiaofeng] stopped the car, listening to the sound of the motorcycle.
1:5:39|1:5:49|He slowly turned his head and rode back to the T-junction he had just passed, stopping at the intersection and looking in the direction of the motorcycle sound he heard.
1:5:49|1:5:56|On the other side, under the gaze of the villagers sitting by the roadside, [Wang Youquan] rode his motorcycle to the door of his house.
1:5:56|1:6:3|[Dong Xiaofeng] touched the cloth bag in her arms, flicked her upper lip, started the motorcycle, and rode off in the opposite direction of [Wang Youquan]'s house. The sky was turning dark.
1:6:3|1:6:13|In the darkness, [Dong Xiaofeng] shook her head, adjusted her helmet and glasses. As the night fell completely, she was still riding her motorcycle searching for the way.
1:6:13|1:6:25|The next day, during the day, [Dong Xiaofeng] rode her motorcycle past the washing line ditch again. At this time, there were police cars parked on the road of the washing line ditch, and some workers were watching. [Dong Xiaofeng] directly drove past the scene of the crime.
1:6:27|1:6:35|[Dong Xiaofeng] returned to the nightclub, a woman called out to her, but [Dong Xiaofeng] ignored her and instead looked eagerly at each doorway.
1:6:38|1:6:47|The other woman in the aisle replied to him. [Dong Xiaofeng] paused for a moment and then quickly stepped forward, pushing open the door of the private room and walking in. However, once inside, [Dong Xiaofeng] froze as she saw [Xiao Ping] singing at the table with someone.
1:6:47|1:6:56|[Qian Guixing] sat on the sofa, [Dong Xiaofeng] watched as [Qian Guixing] picked up a glass of wine, [Xiao Ping] pushed away the man trying to sing, and got off the table.
1:7:5|1:7:14|[Xiao Ping] introduced. [Dong Xiaofeng] raised her arm and accidentally bumped into [Xiao Ping]'s nose, while [Qian Guixing] was staring at [Dong Xiaofeng]. [Xiao Ping] asked in confusion. [Dong Xiaofeng] lowered her head.
1:7:30|1:7:37|Boss Ma picked up the wallet on the table and opened it. [Xiao Ping] winked at [Dong Xiaofeng], who rolled her eyes and took a deep breath. [Xiao Ping] then directly took the money from Boss Ma's hand.
1:7:45|1:7:50|[Xiao Ping] smiled and tried to push [Dong Xiaofeng] away, but [Dong Xiaofeng] pushed back. [Qian Guixing] raised his glass and took a sip.
1:7:50|1:7:56|Xiao Ping's face has changed, Qian Guixing puts down his glass and looks at Dong Xiaofeng. Dong Xiaofeng's eyes are rapidly rolling, Qian Guixing has already stood up.
1:7:56|1:8:1|Approaching [Dong Xiaofeng], [Dong Xiaofeng] smirked, [Qian Guixing] slowly walked in, and then kicked.
1:8:27|1:8:36|Qian Guixing pointed at [Dong Xiaofeng]. As Qian Guixing turned around, before Dong Xiaofeng could react, Xiao Ping knelt down on the ground.
1:8:36|1:8:41|Dong Xiaofeng looked nervously at [Dong Xiaofeng]. She gestured for her not to move, took a deep breath, and walked forward.
1:9:14|1:9:18|Qian Guixing swallowed and looked at Boss Ma, followed by Dong Xiaofeng.
1:9:18|1:9:22|Boss Ma tilted his head and turned the Buddhist beads in his hand, while [Dong Xiaofeng] looked at Qian Guixing.
1:9:24|1:9:34|Qian Guixing raised his eyes slightly, [Dong Xiaofeng] glanced at Boss Ma who was about to leave again. He took two steps back, picked up Xiao Ping's coat, and then pulled up the frightened Xiao Ping from the ground. [Dong Xiaofeng] held her and was about to leave.
1:9:34|1:9:47|At this moment, Boss Ma spoke up: [Dong Xiaofeng] and [Xiao Ping] both stood still, Qian Guixing wanted to gesture to stop, but the boss tilted his head and smiled at him. [Dong Xiaofeng] didn't look back, thought for a moment, then turned around.
1:9:50|1:9:56|Mr. Ma, holding a Buddhist prayer beads, said. He turned his head slightly to signal, and Mr. Qian lowered his head,
1:9:56|1:9:58|Put his hands in his pockets and turned his body around.
1:9:59|1:10:20|After speaking, [Dong Xiaofeng] came over to pick up the cloth bag on the ground. [Xiao Ping] stood there blankly, then quickly turned around and ran to pick up the money that Boss Ma had just given him. [Dong Xiaofeng] picked up the cloth bag and turned back to look at [Xiao Ping], then hurried over to pull her, nodding at Boss Ma as they walked away. [Xiao Ping] nervously held the money and was pulled along in a small run. Qian Guixing slightly turned his body and then turned back, pondering with his head down. Back at [Dong Xiaofeng]'s house, [Xiao Ping] rushed over to kiss [Dong Xiaofeng]'s neck but was pushed away and slapped.
1:10:24|1:10:28|[Dong Xiaofeng]'s mouth twitched. [Xiao Ping] stared at [Dong Xiaofeng] with wide eyes.
1:10:28|1:10:53|[Dong Xiaofeng] gasped and straightened out her shirt, while [Xiao Ping] continued to sit on the bed staring at [Dong Xiaofeng]. [Dong Xiaofeng] picked up the cloth bag on the small table, and said to [Xiao Ping], then threw the bag to her before turning away.
1:10:53|1:10:58|Picking up the things on the table, [Xiao Ping] turned her back, tears in her eyes and a frown on her face. It was raining.
1:10:58|1:11:5|Outside the repair shop, [Dong Xiaofeng] and a few people seeking shelter from the rain huddled under the eaves of a small house next to the repair shop, with her constantly glancing towards [Song Lao'er] inside the window.
1:11:5|1:11:14|The stolen young man's car was still parked in the rain, [Dong Xiaofeng] stuck her head out and observed carefully, while [Song Lao'er] inside the window crossed his arms and stared at a spot without moving.
1:11:14|1:11:28|[Dong Xiaofeng]'s surveillance is still ongoing. Coming to the mountain, [Song Lao'er] stops the car on the slope below, gets out to inspect. [Dong Xiaofeng] quickly brakes on the top, at the bend between the two, there is another person stopped there to go around the earthen slope. [Dong Xiaofeng] can see parts of the car.
1:11:28|1:11:35|Walking towards the car is [Song Lao'er]. Seeing [Song Lao'er] in sight, [Dong Xiaofeng] quickly lowers her head, waiting for a moment before looking up again.
1:11:35|1:11:42|[Song Lao'er] has already gotten on the car. [Dong Xiaofeng] looked ahead, being careful not to be noticed by [Song Lao'er], so she lowered her body several times.
1:11:42|1:11:59|[Song Lao'er] drove away from the puddle, [Dong Xiaofeng] immediately started the car to follow. Looking back in the direction [Song Lao'er] left, they saw nails scattered on the ground. A motorcycle came over, its tire got punctured, and the person on the bike flipped into the puddle. Seeing this, [Dong Xiaofeng] used her foot to brake, but it was already too late.
1:11:59|1:12:5|He also tumbled into the water pit, falling down first. The person looked at [Dong Xiaofeng], [Dong Xiaofeng] didn't care about the helmet falling off, and sat up.
1:12:5|1:12:14|The man who fell down laughed loudly, and the bewildered [Dong Xiaofeng] looked at him. Time came again for [He Qingyong] to bring Xiao Jun to find [Song Lao'er] that day.
1:12:14|1:12:28|[Dong Xiaofeng] squatted behind a scrapped car across from the auto repair shop, tapping a piece of cement in her hand repeatedly. On the other side, [He Qingyong] and Xiao Jun got into the front passenger seat and back seat respectively. [Dong Xiaofeng] quickly hid deeper, while Xiao Jun grabbed the pole at the back of the car.
1:12:30|1:12:41|The car drove onto the road, and across the street, [Dong Xiaofeng] also got on a motorcycle, slowly accelerating while adjusting her helmet. Meanwhile, [Song Lao'er] left the pig-selling shop, and across the street, [Dong Xiaofeng] was still keeping watch from the store.
1:12:41|1:12:55|Watching [Song Lao'er] leave, [Dong Xiaofeng] cracked melon seeds while following behind. As she walked, she spat or threw the melon seed shells on the ground, and glanced back at the workers walking with her. Turning into an alley, [Dong Xiaofeng] continued walking, but stopped cracking the melon seeds.
1:12:55|1:13:4|Song Lao'er in front suddenly turned around, Dong Xiaofeng quickly hid into the nearby doorway. Song Lao'er kept walking while looking back, Dong Xiaofeng walked while hiding, and then Dong Xiaofeng let out a sigh of relief.
1:13:4|1:13:10|Following the old man leading the cow, [Song Lao'er] cautiously followed his steps and hid behind him. They turned into a narrower path.
1:13:10|1:13:26|Only [Song Lao'er] and [Dong Xiaofeng] were left. [Dong Xiaofeng] hid behind a wall, narrowly avoiding the turning [Song Lao'er]. He put on a helmet, then the pilot goggles on the helmet, raised two index fingers to psych himself up, took out a dagger and charged forward, but quickly pushed against a wall at the doorway of a house.
1:13:26|1:13:32|Managed to dodge, narrowly avoiding being seen by [Song Lao'er] who was about to turn around. [Dong Xiaofeng] was just about to charge forward again.
1:13:34|1:13:44|[Song Lao'er] was so scared that he immediately turned around, [Dong Xiaofeng] hurried back, pushed open the door of the house and slipped in, putting the phone in his clothes. At this moment, the lock on the door outside was knocking due to the wind.
1:13:44|1:13:50|[Dong Xiaofeng] held the knife handle and raised the dagger, holding her breath, her hand holding the dagger trembling slightly. After a moment of silence.
1:13:50|1:13:58|[Dong Xiaofeng] cautiously crept along the wall to observe, checked that no one was around, and took out her phone from the inner pocket, holding the knife handle in her other hand.
1:14:4|1:14:27|[Dong Xiaofeng] went to see [Qian Guixing], who raised his hand and slapped her directly, causing her to spin around and her glasses to fly off. After saying that, [Qian Guixing] took two steps back towards the sofa, then turned around and walked away. [Dong Xiaofeng] hadn't recovered from the slap yet, squinting at [Qian Guixing]. Seeing that [Qian Guixing] didn't say anything, she hurried to pick up her glasses from the side, but accidentally bumped into the tea table.
1:14:27|1:14:39|[Dong Xiaofeng] touched his head with one hand and held his glasses with the other hand. He stood up, looked at the tea rack, put on his glasses, touched the tea rack, turned around, and walked towards [Qian Guixing] while adjusting his glasses. [Qian Guixing] glanced at him.
1:15:0|1:15:7|Qian Guixing pretended to hit him, but instead passed the paper he was holding to him. Dong Xiaofeng adjusted her glasses, unfolded the paper and saw that it was a copy of the police document.
1:15:7|1:15:13|In the photo found by Song Lao'er at Wang Youquan's house, Dong Xiaofeng came to Mingdu Building holding this photocopy.
1:15:14|1:15:25|Glancing at the three characters of Mingdu Building and then at the photocopy in his hand, [Song Lao'er] walked towards Mingdu Building. At this moment, he had already entered the surveillance area.
1:15:44|1:15:49|He wanted to get a closer look, but as Song Lao'er was about to leave, he quickly hid behind the door panel at the entrance to the rooftop.
1:15:49|1:16:1|[Song Lao'er] strode over angrily, pushed the iron gate, went down the stairs, [Dong Xiaofeng] hid behind the wooden board, his glasses were pushed to his nose in a hurry. He slowly turned around, leaving only [Yang Shuhua] on the rooftop watching [Song Lao'er] leave.
1:16:1|1:16:17|Fangxiang, [Dong Xiaofeng] pushed her glasses and prepared to come out from behind the wooden board, but noticed the footsteps of [Yang Shuhua] over there. She was holding a basin and also preparing to leave, so she retreated to her original position. [Yang Shuhua] and [Dong Xiaofeng] passed by each other, but she, full of worries, did not notice.
1:16:17|1:16:35|[Yang Shuhua] had just passed by herself, and [Dong Xiaofeng] immediately glanced sideways, then moved to the door to observe, watching [Yang Shuhua] disappear up the stairs. After a moment of thought, [Dong Xiaofeng] ran out, leaped over the tangled ropes on the rooftop and ran to the edge of the rooftop, clinging to the railing and looking down. He quickly turned his head to search on the rooftop, fixed his eyes on the stone pillar in front of him.
1:16:35|1:16:57|[Dong Xiaofeng] ran over, half squatting, hands grasping the stone pillar and turning it around, then grabbed the bottom of the stone pillar and lifted it up, moved it to the edge of the rooftop, and placed it on the iron railing. He held onto the iron rod on top of the stone pillar and looked down, while his other hand lightly tapped the stone pillar, glanced to both sides, and then looked down again. [Dong Xiaofeng] was panting, sniffed, looked towards the front of the road downstairs, and then looked back.
1:16:57|1:17:8|[Song Lao'er] who had just come down the stairs appeared in the field of vision. [Dong Xiaofeng] adjusted her breathing, repeatedly loosening and gripping the hand on the iron rod, estimating the time to push the stone pillar down. At this moment, [Song Lao'er] was walking directly below the falling stone pillar.
1:17:8|1:17:14|[Dong Xiaofeng] didn't even look, and quickly ran towards the door. As he ran downstairs, a crowd had already gathered downstairs, watching the noisy crowd.
1:17:14|1:17:25|[Dong Xiaofeng] stopped, turned her eyes, and then walked over to that side. Some of the people in the crowd were pointing upwards, while others were looking up. As she walked, [Dong Xiaofeng] looked back, pushed aside the people in front of her, and squeezed in.
1:17:25|1:17:32|Walking along, [Dong Xiaofeng] glanced up and shook her head, looking at the broken pieces on the ground as she moved forward.
1:17:32|1:17:39|Noticing Song Lao'er walking ahead, Dong Xiaofeng followed with her head tilted. Song Lao'er staggered along.
1:17:39|1:17:43|[Dong Xiaofeng] hurriedly took two quick steps, only to be bumped into by [Wang Youquan] head-on.
1:17:44|1:17:55|[Wang Youquan] slapped [Dong Xiaofeng] twice. [Dong Xiaofeng] covered her nose in pain, muttered softly, quickly walked through the gap between two cars, then turned around, covered her nose and walked back, looking up to see [Wang Youquan] who had already gone up the stairs, about to enter the building.
1:17:55|1:18:5|Only a rough outline can be seen. [Dong Xiaofeng] took two steps back, took out a photocopy from her inner pocket, looked up with her mouth open, unfolded the photocopy while looking down, then looked up at the building, and covered her still sore nose with her hand.
1:18:5|1:18:16|[Dong Xiaofeng] covered her nose with one hand and held a photocopy with the other as she quickly walked towards the intersection. After a few steps, she started running, and when she reached the road, she quickly stopped. The street suddenly became noisy, and [Dong Xiaofeng] stood sideways at the roadside.
1:18:16|1:18:23|Glancing around, and then moving a step to the side to see past the tree, [Song Lao'er] was not in front. Hurriedly turning around to look behind, there was also no sign of [Song Lao'er] behind.
1:18:23|1:18:35|[Dong Xiaofeng] was attracted by the sound of the horn, turned around, but it was just a passing car. [Dong Xiaofeng] looked in the direction she was originally searching for, then back at the building, panting and nodding repeatedly, stuffing the photocopy back into her pocket.
1:18:35|1:18:52|Biting her lip, nodding, and looking around privately, [Dong Xiaofeng] spotted the noodle shop across the street, with a sign that read "Duanji Lamb Noodle," selling noodles and rice rolls. She sat at the entrance of the noodle shop, took off her glasses, pressed her nose, and stared at the roadside. Then she turned back to watch the shop owner making noodles. As she watched, the shop owner finished making the noodles and brought them over in a clay pot.
1:18:52|1:19:16|[Dong Xiaofeng] immediately put on her glasses, raised the chopsticks in her hand as if to pick something, then remembered something, picked up the vinegar bottle next to her and poured some in, scooped a spoonful of chili into the pot, picked up two chopsticks, blew on the hot food, about to put it in her mouth. However, when she looked up, she saw [Wang Youquan] and [Yang Shuhua] across the street. [Dong Xiaofeng] held the chopsticks up, eyes fixed on the opposite side, tongue just touched the food, got burned by the hot steam and quickly let go. She looked at the noodles in front of her, moved the chopsticks up and down a few times, her mouth moving accordingly. Then she turned her head to look across the street, still inserting the chopsticks into the pot and reaching into her pocket to take out a photo.
1:19:22|1:19:39|[Wang Youquan] handed over the ticket, and when [Dong Xiaofeng] arrived, she also handed over the ticket and asked the ticket inspector to tear it off. [Dong Xiaofeng] supported herself on the car door and got on the car. Looking back, [Wang Youquan] was already sitting in the front of the car. As [Dong Xiaofeng] walked towards the car, she looked at [Wang Youquan].
1:19:39|1:19:51|[Wang Youquan] was knocked down and glanced at [Dong Xiaofeng] before looking up and down. [Dong Xiaofeng] sat next to a fat aunt who had already fallen asleep, holding her arms and looking ahead, then straightened up and stretched her neck. The fat aunt next to her kept sleeping and leaned on [Dong Xiaofeng]'s shoulder.
1:19:51|1:20:2|[Dong Xiaofeng] pursed her lips and saw the fat auntie, tilting her head back. The fat auntie was still leaning towards her, so [Dong Xiaofeng] deliberately moved away, but the fat auntie ended up leaning on her back. After a while, the fat auntie's head returned to its original position and continued sleeping.
1:20:2|1:20:5|[Dong Xiaofeng] fell asleep, and their heads even leaned together as they slept.
1:20:5|1:20:24|After a while, Auntie Fat leaned towards the window, while [Dong Xiaofeng] fell asleep leaning on Auntie Fat. He slowly opened his eyes, adjusted his body, sat up a bit, turned his neck, and suddenly noticed something in front. He adjusted his glasses, looked ahead again, glanced at the window on the opposite side, turned forward, held onto the seats in front and opposite, stood up and walked towards the front, then held onto the seats on both sides and walked towards the front of the bus.
1:20:24|1:20:30|Looking around and not seeing [Wang Youquan], he hurried forward and patted the driver's head, asking.
1:20:34|1:20:45|[Dong Xiaofeng] opened her mouth wide, straightened her body, took a step back, and the driver, wearing gloves, touched the head that had just been hit. [Dong Xiaofeng] quickly walked to the back of the car, leaned against the seat and looked out of the rear window, then turned around and slapped the still sleeping fat aunt twice.
1:20:56|1:21:0|Outside the Mingdu Building, [Dong Xiaofeng] gets off the vehicle carrying livestock, covered in dirt.
1:21:0|1:21:6|After tapping the car, the car drove away. [Dong Xiaofeng] wiped the lens with her hand, then kept her hand on the edge of the glasses, looking at the Mingdu Building.
1:21:6|1:21:18|Then he put down his hand, crossed the traffic with his legs, and walked towards the noodle shop. [Dong Xiaofeng] ordered a bowl of noodles outside the noodle shop and sat down, ready to wait for the opportunity. He kept staring at the opposite side, paying attention. The boss lady prepared the noodles and walked out of the shop with a clay pot.
1:21:26|1:21:38|[Wang Youquan] was walking towards him counting money from behind, folding the money and putting it into his pocket as he approached. [Dong Xiaofeng] was lifting a chopstick of noodles, blowing on the hot steam, and as the passing [Wang Youquan] bumped into a stool, it made a noise. [Dong Xiaofeng] looked up and was about to lower his head to eat.
1:21:38|1:21:49|He immediately raised his head, looked back at the path where Wang Youquan was coming, prepared to take a quick bite of noodles, but got burned by the noodles. He simply stuck the chopsticks in and got up to chase after the person. He stumbled over a stool and picked up the nearby empty clay pot while he was at it.
1:21:49|1:21:54|[Dong Xiaofeng] held a sand pot in her right hand, following behind [Wang Youquan], panting as she took two quick steps.
1:21:54|1:22:3|Suddenly rushed forward, raised the pot and smashed it on [Wang Youquan]'s head. [Wang Youquan] fell to the ground immediately, and all the passersby on the roadside stopped to watch, some even walked down from the sidewalk.
1:22:3|1:22:15|Standing on the street. [Dong Xiaofeng] flicked away the dirt on her head, grabbed [Wang Youquan]'s collar and dragged him to the side of the road. A van drove by, [Wang Youquan] was completely unconscious. [Dong Xiaofeng] walked towards the tricycle at the entrance of Mingdu Building and said to the driver on the tricycle:
1:22:19|1:22:26|Master was awakened by Dong Xiaofeng's shout, got off the tricycle, put on his Lei Feng hat, and walked over to Wang Youquan on the ground to help.
1:22:26|1:22:32|The tricycle is driving on a deserted road in the mountains, with a river on one side and mountains on the other. The tricycle is slowly descending the gentle slope.
1:22:32|1:22:39|Song Lao'er slowly stopped the wheel near the riverbank where the road had not been repaired to connect to the river.
1:22:39|1:22:53|The tricycle driver watched as [Wang Youquan] pulled [Dong Xiaofeng] off the vehicle, then looked at the ground, back at [Dong Xiaofeng], who glanced at [Wang Youquan], noticed the driver's gaze, reached into her pocket, took out 100 yuan, and handed it to the driver without looking back.
1:22:53|1:23:8|Master took the money, [Dong Xiaofeng] leaned against the front of the car and said. Master nodded, [Dong Xiaofeng] gasped and said: Master turned his head to look, then glanced at [Dong Xiaofeng].
1:23:9|1:23:17|[Song Lao'er] started the tricycle and left after losing a head. [Dong Xiaofeng] even kicked the back of the tricycle before circling around to the other side of [Wang Youquan].
1:23:17|1:23:19|Looking down at [Wang Youquan] with legs spread apart,
1:23:27|1:23:33|Glancing down, [Wang Youquan] was dragged onto the boat. His hands were tied, and he lay on the gangplank of the boat.
1:23:33|1:23:40|The river water kept rushing towards him. Awakened by the river water, he opened his mouth and tried to lift his head, but still got choked by the water. [Dong Xiaofeng] watched from behind and walked to the side of the jump board winch.
1:23:43|1:23:54|The water is getting deeper, [Wang Youquan] is completely soaked in the water but can't get up. [Wang Youquan] can't hold his head up, it's completely buried in the water. Over here, [Dong Xiaofeng] speaks up and asks. [Wang Youquan] struggles to turn his body, retching.
1:23:58|1:24:4|[Dong Xiaofeng] turns the winch, and the wheel of the winch spins rapidly. [Wang Youquan]'s head is submerged in the water again.
1:24:28|1:24:36|[Dong Xiaofeng] hangs on the chain of the winch, holding onto it with her hands, looking at [Wang Youquan].
1:24:43|1:24:47|[Dong Xiaofeng] unlocks the chain, and once again turns the lever winch.
1:24:47|1:24:54|The wheel turned, and [Wang Youquan]'s head was buried in the water again. [Dong Xiaofeng] held onto the winch, the wheel stopped, and at that moment,
1:24:54|1:24:56|The phone rang.
1:24:56|1:25:6|[Dong Xiaofeng] looked at her pocket, then glanced at the struggling [Wang Youquan], the posture of the winch operator's open hands still maintained. She walked towards [Wang Youquan].
1:25:6|1:25:8|His hand slowly dropped down and walked behind [Wang Youquan],
1:25:8|1:25:20|With both hands, [Song Lao'er] first patted [Wang Youquan]'s buttocks, then moved towards his waist, and finally grabbed the back of his clothes to lift him up. When [Wang Youquan] turned around, he leaned against [Dong Xiaofeng]'s chest with his eyes closed, completely out of his senses from being washed by water. [Dong Xiaofeng] then lifted [Wang Youquan].
1:25:20|1:25:28|He suddenly vomited heavily, [Dong Xiaofeng] also turned his head and retched after smelling it, but still grabbed his collar to find the still ringing phone.
1:25:37|1:25:46|[Wang Youquan] took a peek, then headbutted [Dong Xiaofeng] in the face, causing her to fall to the ground. [Wang Youquan] then ran off, stepping onto the gangway while still retching. [Dong Xiaofeng] lay on the gangway, twitching.
1:25:47|1:25:55|[Wang Youquan] walked unsteadily with his hands still tied. [Dong Xiaofeng] lifted her arm slowly to support herself and made a slight gesture with her hand.
1:25:55|1:26:4|With the support of the other hand, he finally sat up, straightened his buttocks, turned his face, and [Dong Xiaofeng] had two lines of blood on his nose, and one of his glasses was broken, hanging crookedly on his face.
1:26:6|1:26:17|The corner of the mouth twitched, raised a hand to adjust the glasses, but the nose was also bleeding from the previous knock. [Dong Xiaofeng] winced in pain, quickly stopped, curled up her leg, used her fingers to rub her nose, only to get blood on them.
1:26:18|1:26:22|Upon getting up, [Dong Xiaofeng] picked up an iron rod and walked with it.
1:26:22|1:26:30|Go find [Wang Youquan], covering his nose with one hand. At this moment, [Wang Youquan] came out of the driver's cabin and was seen by [Dong Xiaofeng]. [Dong Xiaofeng] ran up to him and threw the iron rod in her hand.
1:26:54|1:27:5|Without hesitation, [Dong Xiaofeng] picked up the iron rod and leaned on the railing, ready to chase. As he stood up and adjusted his glasses, using the iron rod for support, he took a step and was hit in the leg by the iron stool that [Wang Youquan] had already thrown. [Dong Xiaofeng] fell down the steps.
1:27:5|1:27:12|Clutching his leg and screaming, but quickly he stood up holding an iron stool against the railing. Realizing it was the wrong hand, he threw it away and picked up the iron rod from the ground.
1:27:12|1:27:25|Wang Youquan climbed the steps again, reached the deck, and turned around to see Song Lao'er. Wang Youquan immediately took the fire extinguisher next to him and threw it towards Dong Xiaofeng. The gas in the fire extinguisher was released upon impact, creating a white cloud. Meanwhile, Dong Xiaofeng had already started chasing Wang Youquan with a stick.
1:27:25|1:27:36|One hit on the glass, then another hit on the glass, blood dripping from under [Dong Xiaofeng]'s nose, watching [Wang Youquan] fleeing, then turning back to block [Wang Youquan]. Grabbing and forcefully pulling the ankle of [Wang Youquan] who was kicking.
1:27:36|1:27:38|Wang Youquan's shoes were pulled off.
1:27:38|1:27:44|[Dong Xiaofeng] bent down to tie her shoelaces, swaying her body as the shoes spun a few circles.
1:27:46|1:27:53|He pushed up his glasses and looked up, walked to the ladder, one hand holding his glasses, the other hand grabbing the ladder and climbing up.
1:27:53|1:28:2|Wang Youquan could pop his head out but didn't see him above. Dong Xiaofeng looked around, then climbed up with both hands and took a few unsteady steps as soon as he got up.
1:28:3|1:28:12|After standing still and turning around, [Wang Youquan] was still not seen. He then bent down and looked under the ladder, but still couldn't find him. Climbing to another corner and looking down, he stood up and turned around.
1:28:12|1:28:21|Looking around, holding onto the mast and looking around, fixed his eyes on the river, and saw [Wang Youquan] swimming towards the shore.
1:28:22|1:28:30|[Dong Xiaofeng] shouted towards [Wang Youquan], leaning against the mast and panting.
1:28:32|1:28:45|The iron hat on the mast was taken down by him and fell to the ground. [Dong Xiaofeng] could only drive the boat back to the shore, the gangway gradually approached the land, shoveling the soil on the ground forward, and the boat stopped.
1:28:46|1:29:0|On the boat, [Dong Xiaofeng] walked off the deck with her toes pointing inward, limping along. She held onto her glasses with one hand and opened the gangway with the other, heading towards the shore. As she stepped off the gangway, she even twisted her foot a bit.
1:29:0|1:29:6|He walked with bent legs step by step, while the sound of a police siren could be heard in the distance.
1:29:6|1:29:17|In the distance, a police car is turning down the hill on the road. [Dong Xiaofeng] stops and looks around before walking in the same direction as the police car. At this moment, ...
1:29:17|1:29:22|The police car also drove to the riverside and stopped, but [Dong Xiaofeng] was on the opposite side of the river.
1:29:22|1:29:30|Two people get out of the police car and walk towards the river. The fourth title appears - a messy mess, like a tangled mess.
1:29:30|1:29:55|At the entrance of a residential building, [Song Lao'er] drove up and pulled the brakes, opened the car door from the window with his left hand, holding a snake skin bag in his right hand. He got out of the car, closed the door, switched the snake skin bag to his right hand, and walked into the alley ahead. At the end of the alley, there was a motorcycle parked at the entrance. [Song Lao'er] walked up the slope and entered the room. He placed the snake skin bag on the table and slowly opened it.
1:29:57|1:30:4|He took out the white suit and handed it to [Qian Guixing] across from him. At this moment, [Qian Guixing] in the red shirt had a pale face.
1:30:5|1:30:18|[Song Lao'er] stared at [Qian Guixing], who looked up and blinked, then placed an arm on the table and asked back. [Song Lao'er] reached into his inner pocket, took out the photo from the white suit, and found his own photo.
1:30:26|1:30:38|Pulling out a photo of himself with [Qian Guixing], [Qian Guixing] looked at the photo, then glanced at [Song Lao'er], and blinked.
1:30:40|1:30:48|Step back a little, and say, [Song Lao'er] puts the photo in front of [Qian Guixing],
1:31:13|1:31:20|[Song Lao'er] looked at [Qian Guixing] inquiringly, but [Qian Guixing] just smiled, turned his face away, and said:
1:31:29|1:31:36|[Song Lao'er] rolled his eyes up and stared at [Qian Guixing], who swallowed hard and blinked.
1:31:36|1:31:45|Deflated, [Song Lao'er] still stared at [Qian Guixing], took a step back, and said:
1:32:2|1:32:13|[Song Lao'er] finished his reasoning, and a twitch appeared at the corner of [Qian Guixing]'s mouth before he managed to force out a smile.
1:32:25|1:32:29|Qian Guixing quickly got up and pressed the hang-up button, both of them leaning forward and looking at each other.
1:32:29|1:32:41|The telephone wire swayed, [Song Lao'er] frowned and held the phone firmly. [Qian Guixing] lifted one hand off the table.
1:33:23|1:33:46|The two looked at each other, [Song Lao'er] blinked, slowly put down the phone, looked elsewhere in confusion, then slightly aggrievedly lowered his head, sighed, and after a moment, spoke up:
1:34:2|1:34:13|[Song Lao'er] tilted his head and didn't look at [Qian Guixing] anymore, while [Qian Guixing] nodded slightly.
1:34:28|1:34:34|[Song Lao'er] lowered his head even further as they both remained silent. [Qian Guixing] swallowed hard.
1:34:34|1:34:44|[Song Lao'er] looked like a child who had made a mistake. [Qian Guixing] moved first, tidying up the photos on the table. He placed the photos back on the table and then looked up to observe [Song Lao'er].
1:34:58|1:35:10|[Song Lao'er] took a deep breath with eyes closed, lowering his head even more. Just as he raised his head, [Song Lao'er]'s phone rang, and he took it out to answer.
1:35:21|1:35:30|[Song Lao'er] kicked [Qian Guixing] in the chest, pointing a gun at him and shouting. The two of them sat in [Song Lao'er]'s car and drove towards the repair shop.
1:35:31|1:35:39|[Song Lao'er] slammed on the brakes, at the door, [Dong Xiaofeng] was gnawing on sugar cane. As the car stopped, he used the other hand holding a dagger to push his glasses down from his head.
1:35:39|1:35:43|[Song Lao'er] got off the car with a long spear in hand and walked towards the steps at the entrance, stopping.
1:35:43|1:35:54|In front of them, [Dong Xiaofeng] was stepping on [Song Tao] sitting on a barrel. When [Song Lao'er] saw this, he immediately straightened up. [Song Lao'er] ran up the steps, [Dong Xiaofeng] spat out the sugarcane in her mouth, and [Song Lao'er] went to the back of the car to untie [Qian Guixing] who was tied up there.
1:35:54|1:36:5|[Song Lao'er] pushed [Qian Guixing] down the steps and grabbed him by the collar. Seeing this, [Dong Xiaofeng] threw the sugarcane, grabbed [Song Tao]'s collar, and then jumped off the oil drum. The two of them slowly approached each other, holding the people in their hands.
1:36:5|1:36:14|With a cloth stuffed in his mouth, [Qian Guixing] desperately shook his head to signal, while [Song Lao'er] fiercely held a long spear and [Dong Xiaofeng] slapped a knife on [Song Tao]'s face.
1:36:18|1:36:23|[Song Lao'er] fired a shot towards the sky, hitting the tin roof and causing a cloud of dust to fall.
1:36:33|1:36:38|[Song Lao'er] watched as his son approached, the gun still resting on [Qian Guixing]'s shoulder. [Dong Xiaofeng] held a dagger, only able to keep one eye open.
1:36:43|1:36:50|The two quickly got up, [Qian Guixing] turned around, and [Dong Xiaofeng] untied the rope for him. [Song Lao'er] took two steps back and waved to [Song Tao], while [Qian Guixing], who had untied the rope, raised his hand and slapped him.
1:37:6|1:37:12|[Dong Xiaofeng] waved the knife, blood splattered everywhere. [Song Lao'er] quickly covered [Song Tao]'s eyes, while [Dong Xiaofeng] held her nose and howled.
1:37:20|1:37:24|Here, [Song Lao'er] pushes [Song Tao] into the driver's seat and quickly turns the key.
1:37:24|1:37:35|[Dong Xiaofeng] turned around at the sound, took three steps and two steps over, [Song Lao'er] anxiously lighting a fire. [Dong Xiaofeng] took two steps up the steps, [Song Lao'er] lighting the fire while looking out the window, [Dong Xiaofeng] had already walked to the car, gripping the knife handle and stabbing in.
1:37:51|1:38:0|[Song Lao'er] tried his best to stop [Dong Xiaofeng], but [Song Tao] fired a shot. [Dong Xiaofeng] tumbled down the stairs and hit her head into a tub made of tires.
1:38:1|1:38:7|[Song Lao'er] looked out the window in surprise, then at [Song Tao]. Realizing what was happening, he quickly started a fire.
1:38:7|1:38:30|Looking at [Dong Xiaofeng] under the steps, driving away, [Dong Xiaofeng] under the steps lifted her head from the tires, her hair in a mess, her face stained with blood, oil, and water, panting, sprayed out the water in her mouth, lying on the ground looking forward, then looking around, sticking her butt out and turning her head to look at the steps, inside the car, [Song Lao'er] cried and looked at [Dong Xiaofeng] in the rearview mirror, who was riding a motorcycle and catching up.
1:38:33|1:38:41|In the rearview mirror, [Dong Xiaofeng] grew larger and larger. [Song Lao'er] blinked and confirmed again, then stepped on the gas pedal, looking at [Dong Xiaofeng] in the rearview mirror.
1:38:42|1:38:51|[Song Lao'er] shouted at [Song Tao] who was holding a long spear and crying. [Dong Xiaofeng]'s face was very swollen, following behind [Song Lao'er]'s car.
1:38:58|1:39:5|Turning the steering wheel left and right, [Song Lao'er] blocked [Dong Xiaofeng] behind the car, causing the roadside dust to be stirred up by [Song Lao'er]'s car, with [Dong Xiaofeng] following steadily behind.
1:39:5|1:39:19|[Song Lao'er] kept his neck down, paying attention to the front and back, changing gears with his feet, steering with his hands. He glanced back, but a car was coming from the opposite direction. He quickly steered and hit the brakes, but it was too late, and he rushed towards the slope by the roadside.
1:39:19|1:39:24|The car bumped and tumbled down to the bottom of the slope, flipping over completely.
1:39:24|1:39:30|The front of the car was blocked by a stone, it backed up a bit, the hanging amulet inside the car swayed, and the car gradually stabilized.
1:39:31|1:39:39|[Dong Xiaofeng] slowly stopped the motorcycle, looked down the slope, twisted the key to turn off the engine, put down her feet for support, and looked down from the roadside, but the slope was too steep.
1:39:39|1:39:46|[Dong Xiaofeng] tried to steady herself, panting as she looked down below. She wanted to confirm the status of the people below, as night fell.
1:39:46|1:39:53|[Dong Xiaofeng] rode her motorcycle back to the yard where she lived with the headlights on. She slowly stopped downstairs, using her feet to support the ground.
1:39:53|1:39:56|The sound of the motorcycle quieted down, and then,
1:39:56|1:40:8|Glancing back, he took out his phone, extinguished the fire, and then put down the footrest. Looking up at the building, he dialed Xiao Ping's phone number, holding the phone with one hand.
1:40:8|1:40:17|One hand slid forcefully on the phone screen with the index finger. Looking upstairs, licked the lips, put the phone to the ear, and tapped the phone with the index finger.
1:40:26|1:40:33|[Dong Xiaofeng] got off the motorcycle and almost lost her balance, then turned around to look upstairs.
1:40:33|1:40:53|There was no sound on the phone. [Dong Xiaofeng] asked with her head tilted: as she turned her head, she saw two people standing at the door, and as she turned her head again, there were also two people at the entrance of the unit behind her.
1:40:53|1:41:0|On the stairs, [Xiao Ping] ran down while holding onto the wall, two police officers grabbed her and covered her mouth. [Dong Xiaofeng] turned around to run, but police officers came from both front and back.
1:41:16|1:41:25|[Dong Xiaofeng] stood with one hand behind her back, looking up at [Xiao Ping] with a mournful expression as [Xiao Ping] struggled.
1:41:30|1:41:42|[Dong Xiaofeng] reached out with her phone in hand, leaning towards [Police Liu] in front of her. She then turned back to the police surrounding her with guns, smiled, and nodded at them.
1:42:13|1:42:18|Police Liu tilted his head in suspicion, and Xiao Ping, upon hearing this, became excited and struggled.
1:42:18|1:42:26|[Dong Xiaofeng], with tears in her eyes and a frown on her face, nodded slightly.
1:42:40|1:42:44|Chen fired a shot, hitting Dong Xiaofeng right in the forehead.
1:42:44|1:42:53|[Xiao Ping] stared with wide eyes in place, [Dong Xiaofeng] rolled her eyes and fell to the ground while still holding the brush strokes. [Xiao Ping] opened her hands and shouted.
1:42:54|1:42:58|Police Liu swallowed hard and looked at Xiao Chen, who was shooting. Upstairs, Xiao Ping was being held down, struggling to break free.
1:42:58|1:43:10|The police slowly approached Dong Xiaofeng lying on the ground. One of the police officers kicked the knife away and Dong Xiaofeng fell into a pool of blood, surrounded by the group.
1:43:10|1:43:14|The fifth character appears.
1:43:14|1:43:24|Chicken mushroom, with 5 mushrooms painted on it. On the village road, a white car with a Yunan A license plate slowly approaches and comes to a stop.
1:43:24|1:43:36|A foot in leather shoes stepped down. [Song Lao'er] and Song Tao, wearing neck braces, watched as people got off the car. A pig was locked in a cage, eating and grunting.
1:43:40|1:43:49|The person in the car got out and asked, [Song Lao'er] struggled to snort at the pig and at the people.
1:43:55|1:44:4|Arriving at the car, [He Qingyong] lowered the ramp, lifted the cage containing the pig, and pushed it inside. In front, [Song Lao'er] opened the car door and then supported the neck brace behind.
1:44:6|1:44:9|[Song Lao'er] shouted to Song Tao in the back of the car.
1:44:9|1:44:23|On the bumpy road carved out by the wheels of the white car in the desolate mountains, patches of dust floated from low to high, passing through a puddle and continuing to drive forward with ups and downs. The people in the car swayed back and forth, and the car finally came to a stop.
1:44:23|1:44:28|Sitting by the roadside is [Wang Youquan] leaning on a crutch, with [Yang Shuhua] standing beside him.
1:44:56|1:45:12|[Yang Shuhua] supported [Wang Youquan], opened the car door for him, and the two got in. The pig in the back of the car was also heading to the same destination as them, while [Song Lao'er] turned his head, holding his neck.
1:45:21|1:45:30|In the mine, a white car drove onto the asphalt road.
