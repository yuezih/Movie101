0:3:40|0:4:1|[Xiaorong] took off her earphones to rest, and [Chen Mo] also turned to take off his earphones, looking at [Xiaorong], accidentally pushing the volume up. After a moment of contemplation, [Xiaorong] turned around and looked up at [Chen Mo], slowly saying. [Chen Mo] sat blankly in the chair, [Xiaorong] turned her head to avoid his gaze, and let out a long sigh.
0:4:12|0:4:18|Chen Mo's colleague urgently knocked on the glass and gestured in sign language that their conversation was being broadcast. Chen Mo quickly turned it off, then he said a sentence with reluctance and defiance.
0:4:21|0:4:42|After taking off the headphones from his neck and slamming them heavily on the table, [Chen Mo] turned around and walked away. The camera gradually pulled back with his footsteps, revealing the recording studio on the rooftop and the colorful night view of Chongqing. Subsequently, the names of the original author Zhang Jiajia, director Zhang Yibai, and the title of the film "You Are the One" appeared in the scene.
0:4:42|0:5:8|As the music comes to an end, the story of the film also reaches a day two years later. [Chen Mo] is wearing headphones in the recording studio, leaning back lazily in his chair and yawning.
0:5:26|0:5:42|[Chen Mo] turned off the advertisement, immediately switched to music, and started to groove along with the rhythm, unable to resist the urge to move his body. After a while, he began scratching his head, rubbing his ears, and yawning, then boredly started playing with his phone. The noisy music irritated many of the audience.
0:5:42|0:5:57|The person doing styling in the barber shop, the head chef in the restaurant kitchen, the employee in the white-collar studio, the passenger in the taxi, and even the ex-[Xiaorong] have all turned off the radio.
0:6:52|0:7:22|[Lizhi] appears, the rice cooker explodes, [Mao Shibei] runs away. [Mao Shibei] is tinkering with a remote-controlled airplane, while [Lizhi] watches on. The remote-controlled airplane explodes in the air, [Lizhi] teases, and [Mao Shibei] turns around to run away again. [Lizhi] chases after him, the scene cuts to the rooftop where [Zhutou] is using the foam from the washing powder in the pot to scrub clothes.
0:8:1|0:8:17|[Chen Mo's Mom] took out chopsticks thoughtfully, and [Chen Mo] took the opportunity to tap [Zhutou]'s head with the chopsticks. In the office, a group of interns were discussing the trophies that [Xiaorong] had won, completely unaware of [Chen Mo] standing behind them.
0:9:9|0:9:44|The two of them spoke in unison, the interns hesitated and made excuses to leave. At this moment, a girl's voice was heard in the crowd, and [Yaoji] withdrew her smile, looking awkwardly at [Chen Mo]. On the streets of Chongqing, street vendors skillfully made street snacks, [Chen Mo], [Zhutou], and [Mao Shibei] squatted on the side of the street eating noodles on stools. [Lizhi], dressed in a police uniform, walked towards the three of them. [Mao Shibei] looked up, saw [Lizhi], dropped his chopsticks, and ran away.
0:9:46|0:10:6|Lizhi followed closely behind, Chen Mo and Zhutou also dropped their chopsticks. The four of them chased each other, and the street vendor selling noodles ran out shouting. Along the bustling street, they ran for who knows how long. Mao Shibei's stamina decreased, Lizhi grabbed Mao Shibei and pressed him against the wall.
0:10:36|0:10:41|Lizhi next to him was secretly taking photos of Mao Shibei with her phone, while smiling and looking down. Mao Shibei and Zhutou silently cleaned up the small ads on the wall.
0:10:41|0:10:51|[Chen Mo] walked up to [Lizhi] and saw her taking photos secretly. When [Lizhi] noticed, she immediately put away her phone.
0:11:0|0:11:22|[Mao Shibei] and [Chen Mo] passed by each other, walked up to [Lizhi], [Mao Shibei] ignored him, then tore down a small advertisement. [Mao Shibei] looked towards [Zhutou], while [Lizhi] chuckled quietly.
0:12:57|0:13:25|[Chen Mo] looked at [Yaoji] in surprise. After [Yaoji] finished speaking, she realized [Chen Mo] was staring at her in shock. She quickly bowed and apologized. The microphone on her head fell to the ground due to the bowing motion. [Yaoji] hurriedly picked up the microphone and put it back on, but in her fluster, she didn't notice that she put it on backwards. She bowed her head, covering her face in embarrassment. [Chen Mo] bit off a piece of noodle, struggled to swallow the remaining bit in his mouth, and continued the live broadcast.
0:13:30|0:13:35|On the rooftop outside the recording studio, [Yaoji] nervously holds a bowl of noodles facing [Chen Mo], while [Chen Mo] points at [Yaoji]'s forehead.
0:14:15|0:14:22|A group of pigeons flew away in response, [Yaoji] placed the noodles on the ground and walked away, while radio stations in various cities were broadcasting.
0:14:49|0:14:52|The camera cuts back to the office, with [Xiaorong] walking towards everyone holding a file.
0:14:57|0:15:8|[Xiaorong] lowered her head and saw [Chen Mo] sleeping on the ground. Without saying a word, she kicked him in the butt. [Chen Mo] grunted and woke up, then immediately got up when he saw it was [Xiaorong]. However, he looked drowsy and exhausted after standing up.
0:15:10|0:15:18|The crowd let out a gasp, [Chen Mo] rubbed his eyes, unable to believe it, looking in a daze in the direction [Xiaorong] had left.
0:15:34|0:15:45|[Chen Mo] was looking at the viewership data from the last live broadcast when suddenly someone tapped on his shoulder. Startled, [Chen Mo] turned around to see a person wearing a gorilla mask, and he screamed in fear. He swung his fist and knocked the person down to the ground. Outside the recording studio on the rooftop, [Chen Mo] put on the gorilla mask and took a selfie.
0:15:48|0:15:58|Handing a bottle of ice water to the person next to him, it turns out the one dressed as a gorilla is [Yaoji]. [Yaoji] takes the ice water, while [Chen Mo] continues to take selfies.
0:16:42|0:17:6|[Chen Mo] got up and walked towards the door, taking out a key from his pocket and threw it to [Yaoji]. [Yaoji] caught the key and smiled happily, then unexpectedly did a somersault on the rooftop. [Chen Mo] took off his gorilla mask and looked thoughtfully at [Yaoji] in front of him. [Yaoji] accidentally fell to the ground, but when she saw [Chen Mo] looking at her, she ran her fingers through her messy hair and grinned foolishly at him.
0:17:9|0:17:14|In the dormitory, [Zhutou] is holding a phone and watching a video.
0:17:19|0:17:32|Showing the tattoo on his chest to [Yanzi], [Zhutou] pulled the collar of his shirt, wanting [Yanzi] to see it more clearly.
0:17:40|0:17:45|[Zhutou] hurriedly opened the box in front of him and took out a beautiful dress from inside.
0:18:16|0:18:27|The next day, during the day, [Zhutou] was buried in writing something on the table. When he saw [Chen Mo] coming out of the bedroom, [Zhutou] quickly stuffed the paper into his pocket. [Mao Shibei] and [Zhutou] didn't say a word.
0:19:48|0:19:54|[Mao Shibei] took out a card and gave it to [Zhutou], but [Chen Mo] snatched it away.
0:20:1|0:20:30|Saying that, [Zhutou] took the receipt from [Chen Mo]'s hand, [Chen Mo] spread out his hands pointing at [Mao Shibei] and [Zhutou] in front of him, took out a bank card from his wallet and handed it to [Zhutou]. [Zhutou] looked at the card in [Chen Mo]'s hand, saying he didn't want it, but still reached out to take [Chen Mo]'s card. [Chen Mo] let go, turned around and walked out. When he reached the door, he remembered something, turned around and asked. The two looked at each other, [Chen Mo] helplessly turned and left.
0:20:39|0:20:46|The response on the phone made [Xiaorong] stop her steps on the stairs. After a moment of contemplation, she continued walking upstairs towards the live streaming room.
0:20:49|0:21:9|At this moment, [Yaoji] is in the live streaming room. When she looks up and sees [Xiaorong] outside the window, she immediately crouches down and hides under the table. However, she is still spotted by [Xiaorong]. [Xiaorong] pushes the door open and enters the room. [Yaoji], at this moment, grabs her bag and prepares to leave secretly. [Xiaorong] opens the door and exits the live streaming room, with [Yaoji] following closely behind.
0:21:26|0:21:32|Chen Mo, who was walking towards them, heard Xiaorong's words and pointed at her with his head held high.
0:22:40|0:22:46|The camera moves to the display case, where [Chen Mo] picks up his trophy.
0:22:50|0:23:2|After [Chen Mo] slammed the trophy on the ground, everyone gasped. [Yaoji] and [Chen Mo] quickly picked up the trophy from the ground.
0:23:57|0:24:4|[Xiaorong] typed out a message on her phone for [Chen Mo] to see. The message on the phone read "I am a fool" in four words. [Chen Mo] saw the four words through the phone screen.
0:24:36|0:24:59|The commotion stopped, the crowd dispersed, [Xiaorong] turned and walked away, leaving [Chen Mo] and [Yaoji] standing in place. [Chen Mo] made a few punching gestures towards the direction [Xiaorong] left, then turned to look at [Yaoji] behind him. The two stared at each other for a while before finally turning away and disappearing around the corner of the office.
0:25:2|0:25:27|In pouring rain, [Chen Mo] holding takeout in his hand, sees [Chen Mo's Mom] sitting on the distant steps, completely ignoring [Yaoji] who is chasing after him with an umbrella. He rushes into the heavy rain, running towards [Chen Mo's Mom] in the distance, with his soaked clothes clinging tightly to his body.
0:25:50|0:26:2|Chen Mo watched as Chen Mo's Mom made a call, then sat beside her and used his sleeve to wipe the rain-soaked hair. He took out his phone from his pocket to answer the call from Chen Mo's Mom.
0:26:12|0:26:23|[Chen Mo's Mom] turned to see [Chen Mo] beside her, put down her phone, and carefully examined the person in front of her. [Chen Mo] widened his eyes and leaned closer to [Chen Mo's Mom], trying to make her see more clearly.
0:26:25|0:26:32|Chen Mo's Mom carefully scrutinized Chen Mo once again.
0:26:46|0:27:15|[Chen Mo] opened the takeout in his hand and handed it to [Chen Mo's Mom], guarding by her side. He watched as [Chen Mo's Mom] ate heartily, reaching out to tidy up the stray hair by her ear. [Chen Mo's Mom] smiled slightly at him. The camera pulled back, and not far away, [Yaoji] stood under an umbrella, watching the scene unfold. The city's night was brightly lit, with radio stations in various cities playing programs for the evening, and [Chen Mo] and [Yaoji] were no exception.
0:28:44|0:28:56|Xiaorong in the car saw Chen Mo checking himself in the mirror on the radio, Cao stopped the car by the roadside, Xiaorong got off and left. Meanwhile, after the broadcast, Chen Mo and Yaoji arrived at the subway station to take the subway home.
0:29:56|0:30:17|After watching for a few seconds, [Yaoji] walked forward, [Yaoji] caught up, and the two of them sat on the subway where the crowd had passed. [Chen Mo] sat in his seat, looking up and down at [Yaoji], who was leaning alone against the subway handrail with her back to him, then took out his phone and put it to his ear.
0:30:41|0:30:47|[Yaoji] pretends to make a phone call with his cellphone.
0:31:30|0:31:50|The train sped forward, passing one station after another, the scenery outside the window constantly receding. Inside the carriage, [Chen Mo] and [Yaoji] continued to interact.
0:31:54|0:32:4|[Yaoji] happily runs in the subway, while outside the subway in Chongqing, the lights are brightly lit.
0:32:8|0:32:37|[Lizhi] chased after [Mao Shibei] on the street, and [Mao Shibei] stumbled into a dead end, blocked by a fence. The two of them gasped for breath, facing each other. [Mao Shibei] gave [Lizhi] a dissatisfied look.
0:33:25|0:33:40|[Mao Shibei] questioned [Lizhi], who closed the notebook and looked at [Mao Shibei] with a serious expression.
0:33:53|0:34:10|[Lizhi] recalled a past romance, her emotions lingering for a long time. After speaking, [Lizhi] turned and walked away. After a few steps, it seemed like she forgot something, then turned to look at [Mao Shibei]. Seeing her turn, [Mao Shibei] instinctively took a step back.
0:34:25|0:34:29|After listening to Mao Shibei's words, Lizhi smiled and walked towards him.
0:34:53|0:35:5|Upon hearing Mao Shibei's response, Lizhi's gaze shifted away from his face. She shyly turned around and staggered up the steps, swaying as if she had been drinking. Mao Shibei stood in place, watching Lizhi's back.
0:35:13|0:35:27|It started raining in Chongqing. [Xiaorong] got out of the car wearing a windbreaker and holding an umbrella. [Chen Mo] looked down at [Xiaorong] from the window upstairs. [Yaoji] stood on the opposite building, looking at [Chen Mo] through the rain-soaked glass, with a sense of loneliness in his eyes.
0:35:27|0:35:36|[Zhutou] and the group were eating hotpot, [Chen Mo] holding a wine glass, while [Zhutou] stood by the river holding a property certificate and shouting towards the distance.
0:36:28|0:36:33|Seeing [Yanzi] passing by, [Zhutou] caught up with her and ran round and round the playground at night.
0:36:53|0:37:0|Seeing [Zhutou] and [Yanzi] coming to the classroom with books for self-study, the classmates avoided them like the plague, but [Zhutou] remained unfazed.
0:38:3|0:38:7|Chen Mo was moved and bent down to hug Zhutou's head.
0:38:15|0:38:24|[Chen Mo] earnestly held [Zhutou]'s face, looked at him admiringly, breathed a sigh of relief, and sat back in his seat.
0:39:5|0:39:12|After buying breakfast, [Lizhi] returned to [Mao Shibei]'s house and greeted the neighbors warmly.
0:39:25|0:39:38|While tidying up the room, [Chen Mo's Mom] woke up the sleeping [Mao Shibei], put the dirty clothes left on the chair into the washing machine, and heard [Mao Shibei]'s voice coming from inside the refrigerator.
0:39:55|0:40:4|[Lizhi] placed the pancake near Mao Shibei's mouth. Mao Shibei, lying on the bed, still lingered in bed, unwilling to get up, smelling the aroma of the pancake.
0:40:31|0:40:34|[Mao Shibei] leaned forward, gazing affectionately at the shy figure in front of him.
0:40:51|0:41:1|Mao Shibei bent down to take the child's laptop from the crack in the door. By the time he turned around, Lizhi had already put on the police uniform. Mao Shibei's eyes were full of love.
0:41:15|0:41:23|[Lizhi] left with a police cap in one hand and a small gadget invented by Mao Shibei in the other hand as night fell, and the night broadcasts in various cities started again.
0:41:34|0:41:41|[Yaoji] sat in the chair in the recording studio wrapped in a blanket, unable to stop coughing and sniffling. [Chen Mo] massaged his head while talking.
0:41:54|0:41:59|Hastily picking up the medicine next to him, [Yaoji] handed it to [Chen Mo], who drank it silently, followed by [Chen Mo] taking a sip as well.
0:43:8|0:43:14|On the side, [Chen Mo] saw that [Yaoji]'s condition was getting worse and worse.
0:45:58|0:46:18|The nurse in the hospital reminded [Chen Mo] to control the volume. [Chen Mo] repeatedly apologized, then walked over to [Yaoji] after hanging up the phone. At that moment, [Yaoji] was lying on the hospital bed receiving an IV drip. [Chen Mo] was about to cover her with a blanket, but [Yaoji] turned over and hugged his arm. [Chen Mo] bent down and looked around cautiously, then carefully pulled over a chair not far away and sat down, letting out a long sigh.
0:46:18|0:46:24|Quietly watching [Yaoji],
0:46:44|0:46:54|Outside the police station compound, [Mao Shibei] is tinkering with a device in his hands, when [Lizhi] sneaks up from behind and gives him a tap on the head.
0:49:4|0:49:8|After the parade, they returned to the office. [Yaoji] was sitting at the desk when [Chen Mo] came in and looked at [Yaoji].
0:49:11|0:49:18|[Yaoji] gave him a fake smile, they arrived at the airport, [Yanzi] returned from overseas. [Chen Mo] took the luggage.
0:49:50|0:49:56|[Zhutou]'s speech drew cheers from the audience, at this moment [Chen Mo] walked in with [Yanzi].
0:50:3|0:50:17|[Yanzi] walked in, the audience applauded and cheered, friends and family below encouraged [Zhutou] to do well. [Zhutou] and [Yanzi] exchanged smiles. Seeing his lover return, [Zhutou] nervously lowered his head and held the microphone.
0:51:25|0:51:34|[Yanzi] finally opened the door, tears in her eyes, pushing [Zhutou] away, telling him not to come near her. [Zhutou] turned around and said to the people behind him,
0:51:57|0:52:6|Zhutou's expression instantly froze, realizing that this was no joke. Yanzi sobbed.
0:52:31|0:52:38|[Chen Mo] and the others snapped out of their emotions upon hearing what [Yanzi] said. [Yanzi] took [Zhutou] by the hand and walked back to the ceremony site.
0:52:40|0:52:48|[Zhutou] reluctantly forced a strained smile at his friends, then turned around with a gloomy face and walked silently with his head down. [Chen Mo] and the others followed behind them.
0:53:17|0:53:26|Back at the ceremony, [Zhutou] pretended to cheer happily to the crowd.
0:55:2|0:55:11|The three lying on the ground were speechless, [Mao Shibei] helped [Zhutou] up, while [Chen Mo] remained sitting on the ground.
0:55:18|0:55:28|[Xiaorong] finished speaking and turned to sit down. [Zhutou] left, [Yaoji] tried to hold him back, but [Zhutou] completely ignored her and left without looking back.
0:55:28|0:55:36|On the streets of Chongqing, [Zhutou] is preparing to send [Yanzi] away.
0:55:59|0:56:7|[Yanzi] gets into a taxi and prepares to leave.
0:57:0|0:57:5|The taxi sped away, with [Zhutou] kneeling on the ground, wailing loudly.
0:57:32|0:57:46|The thief was tripped by a fruit basket in front, and [Lizhi] immediately seized the opportunity to catch the thief. The thief was burly, and [Lizhi] took a solid punch at him. Ignoring the pain on her face, she grabbed the thief again. Learning from past mistakes, [Lizhi] cleverly avoided the thief's fist this time.
0:57:55|0:58:7|Suddenly, three accomplices of the thief ran up. [Lizhi] grabbed the thief's collar and gave it a hard shake, then kicked him in the stomach.
0:58:13|0:58:34|[Lizhi] fought with four thugs, grabbed one thug and threw him towards a fruit basket on the side. Another thug grabbed her waist trying to control her, but [Lizhi] shook her body and the thug ended up pushing her towards a vegetable stall on the roadside. Seizing the opportunity, [Lizhi] picked up a bunch of celery and hit the thug with it. Seeing the situation turning against him, one thug pulled out a knife and stabbed towards [Lizhi]'s abdomen, only to hit the alarm device on her abdomen.
0:58:40|0:58:46|Mao Shibei at home received the alarm message and rushed out without hesitation, while Lizhi pinned one of them down on the nearby car.
0:58:58|0:59:17|Seeing the thug struggling, [Lizhi] grabbed his center of gravity and both fell to the ground. [Lizhi] removed the broken alarm device and placed it on the ground. Hearing the urgent shout from [Mao Shibei], the onlookers turned their attention. [Lizhi] quickly responded.
0:59:22|0:59:27|The two of them gasped for breath and smiled at each other.
0:59:32|0:59:38|[Lizhi] hesitated to finish speaking, still lying on the ground suppressing the villain, continuing to exchange glances with [Mao Shibei].
0:59:42|0:59:47|[Chen Mo] and [Mao Shibei] were leaning on the balcony railing chatting.
1:0:2|1:0:7|The two arrived at [Chen Mo]'s home, where [Chen Mo] took out a dusty notebook from an old box.
1:0:44|1:1:18|At this moment, the tow truck driver wanted to tow [Xiaorong]'s car away. [Chen Mo] turned up the music in the car and drove towards [Xiaorong]'s car, causing the airbags to deploy. [Chen Mo] was injured, with blood on his face and nose. He leaned against the deformed seat, gripping the steering wheel for a while before slowly opening the car door and staggering out. [Xiaorong] held back tears, covering her mouth in disbelief as she watched him. Ignoring her, [Chen Mo] walked away.
1:1:19|1:1:24|Everyone stood still, puzzled by why [Chen Mo] was acting this way.
1:1:27|1:1:30|During the evening radio show, the program was playing Xu Wei's "Blue Lotus Flower".
1:1:34|1:1:46|[Chen Mo] sat blankly in the recording studio, tears in his eyes. As the song was about to reach its climax, [Chen Mo] suddenly sang along with it.
1:1:52|1:2:0|After this experience, [Chen Mo] decided to go to Daocheng to dispel the inner depression.
1:2:8|1:2:14|Accompanying Chen Mo are Lizhi, Mao Shibei, and others. The three are driving on the highway, with Mao Shibei's navigation already sounding.
1:3:16|1:3:24|[Xiaorong] heard this and slowly put down the coffee cup in her hand, deep in thought. On the other side, [Chen Mo] and [Mao Shibei] were discussing something.
1:3:42|1:3:46|Shocked, [Yaoji] decided to help [Mao Shibei] propose on a scorching hot day.
1:3:49|1:3:58|[Chen Mo] received a call from Xiao Li, who appeared wearing a straw hat and pulling a cart full of marriage proposal materials. Upon seeing this, [Chen Mo] and the others hurried forward to help unload the cart.
1:4:19|1:4:22|Ready for everything, [Mao Shibei] took [Lizhi] to the proposal location.
1:4:33|1:4:56|After speaking, [Mao Shibei] grabbed [Lizhi] and ran a little, the two of them laughing happily. They passed through layers of bushes, and [Mao Shibei] brought [Lizhi] to the proposal site. On the vast lawn stood a temporary church built by [Mao Shibei] and others. Looking at the church that could fall over with a gust of wind, [Lizhi] was at a loss whether to cry or laugh. Tears of emotion filled her eyes.
1:5:15|1:5:21|[Mao Shibei] looked affectionately at [Lizhi], took out a ring from his pocket, and knelt down on one knee.
1:6:0|1:6:19|[Lizhi] nodded with a smile, [Mao Shibei] put the ring on [Lizhi]'s hand. Hiding behind the church, [Chen Mo] watched this scene with tears in his eyes. Seeing this, [Yaoji] quickly asked,
1:6:24|1:6:42|Embarrassed Chen Mo wiped away his tears when he was discovered, while Mao Shibei kissed Lizhi's hand. Chen Mo and Yaoji held balloons in their hands, softly counting down before releasing the balloons. Mao Shibei and Lizhi embraced happily, while Chen Mo and Yaoji, excited to see Mao Shibei proposing, also hugged each other.
1:6:45|1:6:52|On a night in Daocheng, [Chen Mo] and [Mao Shibei] gathered to drink. I used to be an inventor without dreams.
1:7:55|1:8:12|The next day, [Chen Mo] and [Yaoji] were in a golden rice field holding a boom microphone for recording. Various insects' calls could be heard sparsely in the field, and in the distance, the songs of local residents working could be heard.
1:8:14|1:8:20|[Yaoji] keenly sensed the sound coming from a distance and quickly pointed the microphone of the recording pole in the direction of the sound.
1:8:48|1:9:1|The two followed the singing to locate the local residents, with [Chen Mo] recording for them. [Yaoji] joined the local residents, and [Chen Mo] couldn't take his eyes off the joyful [Yaoji] in front of him for a long time.
1:9:6|1:9:18|Infected by the atmosphere of the villagers, [Chen Mo] also joined in. He linked arms with [Yaoji], humming the tunes of the local residents, and started dancing to the music.
1:9:21|1:9:38|The night quietly arrived, changing the hustle and bustle of the day. The surroundings were so quiet, adding a touch of mystery to the night in Daocheng. Faintly, a few stars could be seen emitting dim light. [Chen Mo] and [Yaoji] lay on the grass watching the stars.
1:10:2|1:10:19|Chen Mo did not respond. Under the starry sky, Yaoji nestled beside Chen Mo. Suddenly, Yaoji's phone alarm went off, and Yaoji took out the phone.
1:10:24|1:10:32|[Chen Mo] drives with [Yaoji] to search for a wireless signal in preparation for broadcasting.
1:10:38|1:10:42|In the recording studio in Chongqing, [Xiaorong] has already started broadcasting live.
1:13:24|1:13:31|Chen Mo's phone suddenly rang,
1:13:38|1:13:44|Outside the recording studio, a colleague stood up and knocked on the glass, signaling for [Xiaorong] to answer the hotline call.
1:13:57|1:14:9|[Xiaorong] waited quietly for a response on the other end of the phone. She longed to hear a voice from the other end, but instead, there was only prolonged silence.
1:14:16|1:14:19|[Xiaorong] shed tears without saying a word.
1:14:23|1:14:34|From the innocence of youth to the sweetness of love, from the passion of hormones to the increasingly dull and monotonous life, their mutual unwillingness to compromise and admit defeat ultimately led the two to drift further and further apart.
1:14:39|1:14:48|After listening to the radio, [Yaoji] in the car had already cried red eyes, while [Chen Mo] still had a carefree smile on his face.
1:15:10|1:15:13|Yaoji finished speaking, unbuckled the seatbelt, opened the car door, and got out.
1:15:57|1:16:4|[Yaoji] lost control of his emotions, tears filling his eyes.
1:16:21|1:16:29|Yaoji continued to walk forward, not knowing how long she had been walking. It was already light out when Yaoji squatted on the side of the road, with Chen Mo's car parked behind her.
1:16:29|1:16:40|Yaoji suddenly remembered something? He got up and walked towards the car, knocking on the driver's side window.
1:16:50|1:16:53|[Chen Mo] looked at [Yaoji] without saying a word for a long time.
1:17:16|1:17:30|The broadcasts in various cities continued as usual, and [Mao Shibei]'s life carried on. He was tinkering with electrical appliances in his small electronics store, while his fiancée [Lizhi] stood at the door watching him.
1:18:7|1:18:38|In the recording studio on the rooftop, [Chen Mo] was flipping through a stack of documents when a USB drive fell out from one of the files. The USB drive had [Yaoji]'s interview written on it. After looking around the office and seeing no one, [Chen Mo] plugged the USB drive into the computer and put on headphones to watch the content. It was a video of [Yaoji]'s interview. Meanwhile, [Mao Shibei] was tinkering with equipment on the rooftop at home.
1:18:44|1:18:47|[Xiaorong] received a call from [Yaoji],
1:18:48|1:18:54|Xiaorong, can you come to the rooftop? Meanwhile, in the office, Chen Mo also received a call from Yaoji.
1:19:1|1:19:5|Xiaorong is the first to arrive at the rooftop.
1:20:19|1:20:30|Xiaorong hugged Chen Mo, while Yaoji watched from the side and then left for Chen Mo's home.
1:20:35|1:20:50|[Yaoji] settled [Chen Mo's Mom] down and left after she lay down. On the rooftop, [Xiaorong] and [Chen Mo] leaned against the railing chatting.
1:21:37|1:21:46|Chen Mo hesitated for a moment, then quietly took the card from Xiaorong's hand.
1:22:25|1:22:29|[Xiaorong] thought about what [Chen Mo] said, smiled and watched [Chen Mo] turn and leave.
1:22:36|1:22:44|On the rooftop, only [Chen Mo] was left. He made a phone call but couldn't get through. The phone in his hand kept beeping, indicating that the number was switched off.
1:22:52|1:22:54|He was blankly staring into space on the rooftop,
1:23:10|1:23:16|The usual broadcast had a slight change, with [Chen Mo] live in the recording studio.
1:24:43|1:24:51|[Yaoji] drew a house, a tree, and a little girl on the wall.
1:25:4|1:25:8|The boy seeking shelter from the rain is drawing something on the wall.
1:25:10|1:25:17|[Yaoji] watches him painting on the wall through the window in the convenience store.
1:26:54|1:27:6|He was posting small ads in the alley, the ads were about the information of passing through your world.
1:27:43|1:27:54|Chen Mo finished telling the story about [Yaoji], he finished work and looked out the window.
1:28:5|1:28:18|In the mountain city of Chongqing, as the lights come on, the streets are bustling with traffic and people. The calls on the radio seem to go unanswered, leaving [Chen Mo] sitting helplessly in the recording studio.
1:28:20|1:28:48|[Yaoji] got on the bus leaving the city. After a while, a driver pressed the hazard lights button in the bus. Then the cars waiting for traffic lights on the road, the cars parked outside the mall, the taxis picking up passengers, and the white-collar workers off work all turned on their hazard lights. The vehicles within sight were all flashing. A colleague outside the recording studio gestured for [Chen Mo] to look out the window. At this moment, [Chen Mo] was already asleep on the table.
1:28:48|1:29:0|He got up with sleepy eyes, his face full of confusion. After walking out of the recording studio, he couldn't help but look back at his colleagues. After confirming again, he slowly walked to the edge of the rooftop and looked down.
1:29:7|1:29:27|The camera follows his gaze to the dark alley below the rooftop, where vehicles are parked one after another. The cars at the ends of the alley all have their hazard lights on, and the lights in the residential buildings next to the alley are also flickering. Cars are moving on the overpass in the distance, and each residential building emits a dazzling light. The entire mountain city looks like a sea of stars.
1:29:27|1:29:50|On the rooftop, [Chen Mo] couldn't help but smile at the scene before him. The lights became the protagonist of this long night, with bustling traffic and taxi drivers all in action. Rows of car lights formed a brilliant and magnificent landscape, almost all cars had their hazard lights on.
1:29:54|1:30:7|[Chen Mo] walked to the other end of the rooftop, looking at the towering skyscrapers in front of him, with neon lights flashing all over the city. He gazed into the distance, as if hoping to spot [Yaoji] in the long line of cars, but [Yaoji] never appeared.
1:30:14|1:30:22|He entered the recording studio and started broadcasting live again.
1:30:47|1:31:2|On the bus, [Yaoji] burst into tears upon hearing the broadcast. After wiping away his tears, he sent a WeChat message to [Chen Mo]. In the recording studio, [Chen Mo] immediately opened his phone to check the message.
1:31:20|1:31:29|At the end of the day's work, Lizhi rode his motorcycle home. Suddenly, a car in the distance turned on its high beams, blinding Lizhi and forcing him to stop.
1:31:32|1:31:58|She watched as the person with a stick got out of the car, feeling anxious. She parked the motorcycle, stood up, and carefully identified the person getting out of the car. Suddenly, a few people appeared behind her, turns out they were the thieves from last time. [Lizhi] was caught in a dilemma, with no way to advance or retreat. [Mao Shibei] received an alert from the alarm in the electronics store and immediately locked onto the location to head towards where [Lizhi] was.
1:32:2|1:32:10|[Lizhi], who fought alone against the thieves, was already covered in wounds. His fists were no match for the group, and he was captured by them.
1:32:17|1:32:22|[Mao Shibei] arrived at the scene and threw a cardboard box at the thief.
1:33:1|1:33:18|After finishing speaking, [Lizhi] started fighting with them. Seeing [Lizhi] being caught, [Mao Shibei] wanted to fight back. Suddenly, someone stabbed [Mao Shibei] with a knife, leaving him stunned. [Mao Shibei] held his stomach wound, gritting his teeth to stay standing. [Lizhi] stepped back and stood back to back with [Mao Shibei], covering his nose which was injured by the thief.
1:33:21|1:33:28|The police car arrived, and the gang of thieves fled in panic.
1:33:32|1:33:40|[Lizhi] wanted to go help when she saw it, but she was held back by [Mao Shibei], whose hands were covered in blood.
1:33:46|1:33:49|[Lizhi] wanted to break free from [Mao Shibei]'s embrace, but he held her tightly.
1:33:52|1:33:59|[Mao Shibei] lost too much blood and collapsed into [Lizhi]'s arms. The hand holding [Lizhi] gradually loosened and weakly fell down.
1:34:2|1:34:24|Lizhi looked at Mao Shibei, who was limp on her shoulder, and finally realized that Mao Shibei was seriously injured. She used all her strength to hold Mao Shibei, preventing his whole body from falling down. In a panic, she could only hold Mao Shibei tightly, tears streaming down her face.
1:34:55|1:35:1|In Mao Shibei's shop, [Lizhi] couldn't stop sobbing while holding the navigation device he invented.
1:35:5|1:35:14|[Chen Mo] stood at the door of the shop, looking back at her without saying a word. The voice of [Mao Shibei] came from the navigation device.
1:35:43|1:35:50|In Chongqing, summers are always rainy. It's raining again now, [Chen Mo] is standing under an umbrella in front of the wall where [Yaoji] used to paint.
1:36:26|1:36:38|Time passed slowly, and 350 days later, in the town of Xiangcheng in the Garze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan Province, a little boy was playing in the market street. [Chen Mo] approached him.
1:37:59|1:38:20|[Chen Mo] waited by the roadside in the town with a gorilla mask on, hoping that the person getting off the bus would be the one he had been thinking about. However, his hope was dashed as the bus departed. Disappointed, [Chen Mo] took off the gorilla mask and handed it to a child nearby to play with.
1:41:0|1:41:6|[Chen Mo] turned around and left, returning home to see his mom sitting at the dining table, walking over to sit down.
1:42:7|1:42:15|The next day, [Chen Mo] drove to the place where Mao Shibei proposed to [Lizhi].
1:42:33|1:42:44|[Chen Mo] arrived at the destination and was about to get off the car when the navigation system spoke again.
1:43:57|1:44:3|In the streets and alleys, the repaired electrical appliances by Mao Shibei simultaneously played the voice of "I love you, Lizhi".
1:44:37|1:44:44|[Chen Mo] stood on the grass and looked at the distant sky, with a long skirt appearing behind him.
