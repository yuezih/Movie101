0:1:23|0:1:43|Three days later, [Debt-ridden Boss] and two bodyguards continued to climb the world's fifth highest peak, Mount Makalu. The three of them, dressed in thick climbing gear, were climbing in a staggered formation. The chubby bodyguard at the back heard a strange sound, looked back in confusion, and, after confirming that there was no one behind him, hurried to catch up with the team. As the three of them moved forward in a huddle, a sudden noise came from behind.
0:1:44|0:2:1|Three people heard strange noises and simultaneously stopped in their tracks, slowly turning to look at the cliff behind them. Suddenly, a hand holding a baseball bat emerged at the edge of the bottomless cliff, with the bat firmly planted in the snow. The three, taken aback by the unknown situation, were startled. When they regained their composure, they saw two legs without pants struggling to climb up from the cliff edge.
0:2:1|0:2:19|The three of them looked at each other in confusion. While they were still standing there dumbfounded, [Mo Feli] finally climbed up from the cliff edge. [Mo Feli] had an explosion-like hairstyle, wearing only a thin vest and shorts in the extremely cold snowy mountains. His eyebrows, beard, and the little clothes he had on were all frosted, with long icicles hanging from his nostrils.
0:2:20|0:2:38|With rolled eyes and trembling body, [Mo Feli] walked unsteadily towards the three people. When she reached [Lao Ding], she rudely opened his mink coat and slipped inside, taking a deep breath before regaining her composure. [Mo Feli], who was too weak to speak, gestured with her thumb and forefinger to indicate the need for money. Perplexed, [Lao Ding] asked:
0:2:44|0:2:49|[Mo Feli] gestured in a complaining manner with his hands, while also providing his own voiceover.
0:2:58|0:3:4|Before [Mo Feli] could finish laughing, the bodyguard knocked him unconscious with a punch.
0:3:16|0:3:37|The bodyguards then took turns stepping on it, and the three stopped and slowly turned to look at [Mo Feli], only to see [Mo Feli] slowly getting up with blood all over his face. At this moment, the famous prelude of Dolphin Opera II slowly played, and the three looked puzzled at [Mo Feli] who was swaying his neck, preparing to sing.
0:4:5|0:4:13|[Mo Feli]'s high-pitched voice echoed in the rugged mountains, the outrageous high notes causing the glacier beneath to crack open, with the crevice shooting straight towards the mountaintop.
0:4:16|0:4:36|Another high-pitched sound shook the earth, and the snow on the mountain peak hundreds of meters away poured down like a waterfall. A huge avalanche rushed towards the four people. [Lao Ding] and the others panicked and fled, while [Mo Feli] remained calm, singing. However, at this moment, all rescue measures were in vain, as they were all engulfed by the avalanche.
0:4:36|0:4:51|After the avalanche, the majestic snow-capped mountains resembled a silver dragon lying on the clouds. At this moment, [Mo Feli] walked unscathed towards the cliff edge, watching as three people clung tightly to a rope suspended in mid-air. [Mo Feli] menacingly said:
0:5:0|0:5:12|[Mo Feli] watched as his boss, who called him a thug, provocatively blew him a kiss. In the blue sky behind him, the white clouds formed four big characters: "Evil Angel". And thus, the title of the film appeared.
0:5:13|0:5:39|After the clouds were scattered by the strong wind, [Zha Xiaodao] also arrived in the sunny city from the snowy mountains. In a parking lot, a girl with short hair, wearing large-framed glasses, and showing two big front teeth like a rabbit, was holding a stack of thick certificates. Every step she took was on the white lines of the parking spaces. Under her round appearance, she walked straight, looking very naive. When a car blocked her way, she still maneuvered around it following the neat white lines.
0:5:39|0:5:57|When she encountered the white line on the manhole cover that was not connected to the one under her feet, she hesitated for a moment. After jumping over the manhole cover, she looked pleased, as if she had solved a major problem by herself. She continued to walk happily along the white line, but after only a few steps, she was blocked by a couple kissing against the red and green traffic light pole.
0:6:1|0:6:29|Watching the two people lost in their own world and the red light displayed, [Zha Xiaodao] helplessly stopped in his tracks. At this moment, a couple followed a group of pedestrians and ran the red light, crossing the road. Shortly after, when [Zha Xiaodao] saw the green light, he continued happily walking forward. Suddenly, a worn-out off-road vehicle rushed out and knocked [Zha Xiaodao] to the ground. The door opened, and an equally tattered boot stepped heavily on the waterlogged road surface. At that moment, the sky changed abruptly, and dark clouds gathered in an instant.
0:6:29|0:6:39|Wearing sunglasses, the rough and tough thug [Mo Feli] menacingly approaches [Zha Xiaodao], who is lying on the ground. As [Zha Xiaodao] struggles to sit up, holding onto scattered certificates, he says to [Mo Feli]:
0:7:22|0:7:28|The camera captures a close-up of the deeply sunken profile of [Zha Xiaodao] in the car.
0:8:12|0:8:24|After Zha Xiaodao fainted from blood loss, Mo Feli also collapsed due to dizziness. Zha Xiaodao was taken to the hospital with a net-like bandage wrapped around his head and his nostrils stuffed tightly with tissue.
0:8:24|0:8:32|Sitting alone under the bridge with a thick certificate in hand, [Mo Feli] washed his glasses by the pool, wiped them casually with his hand, and then put them on in a daze.
0:8:32|0:8:40|Occasionally her head still throbbed faintly, she wiped the water droplets off her glasses with her hand, frowned, and sat listlessly on the steps.
0:8:40|0:8:48|At this moment, a dog walked up to her. Upon seeing the dog, [Zha Xiaodao] swept away the previous gloom and smiled with her long front teeth, saying to the dog:
0:9:7|0:9:28|As soon as the words fell, the dog squatted on the certificate and pooped. [Zha Xiaodao] quickly took out a tissue from his bag, picked it up stealthily, looked at the direction the dog ran in with a grievance, then looked down at the poop in his hand. Helplessly, he wrapped up the poop and put it in his pocket, then wiped the marks on the certificate.
0:9:28|0:9:36|At this moment, the dog came back with a flyer in its mouth. [Zha Xiaodao] looked at the flyer and slowly raised his head to look at the sky, as if he saw his own hope.
0:9:36|0:9:45|Following the address on the flyer, [Zha Xiaodao] arrived at an old residential area that looked like a construction site. She entered with a puzzled look, observing the dense scaffolding. Suddenly, a voice came from beside her,
0:9:57|0:10:5|Shortly after, the parrot pressed the switch, and at that moment, the mentalist on stage was giving a speech to the audience in the room.
0:10:36|0:10:42|After the speech, [Zha Xiaodao] went to [Zhe Ergen]'s office.
0:10:53|0:11:5|After [Zhe Ergen] finished speaking, he sniffed the mark left by the puppy's poop. Ignoring advice, he stuck out his tongue and licked the mark, then sighed.
0:12:8|0:12:14|Chairman [Hua Zong] laughed heartily and gave a thumbs-up before signaling to Manager [Ji], who then fired her.
0:13:7|0:13:18|[Mo Feli] rushed towards the spinning air conditioner unit with an iron rod in hand, but accidentally stepped into a hole and fell to the ground. Then, he used the rod to knock down the air conditioner unit. [Zhe Ergen] continued to describe the scene.
0:13:55|0:14:1|The child was scared by [Mo Feli] and ran back home crying.
0:14:18|0:14:29|Realizing it, [Zhe Ergen] leaped out of the second-floor window, while [Zha Xiaodao] was still worried. Outside the door, [Mo Feli] shouted:
0:14:33|0:14:50|Seeing [Mo Feli] coming in, the parrot said: After listening, [Mo Feli] turned around slowly and looked at the many fluttering banners, then approached slowly, quickly lifting the banner with an iron rod.
0:14:56|0:15:4|After listening, [Zha Xiaodao] with closed eyes and trembling, said pleasingly: Then the two looked at each other for a moment,
0:15:10|0:15:22|After finishing speaking, [Mo Feli] covered with the banner, fled in the office, and was soon pinned against the wall by [Mo Feli].
0:15:34|0:15:46|[Mo Feli] actually used his mouth to open the bottle cap shouted by [Zha Xiaodao]. Then, after [Zhe Ergen] finished injecting [Mo Feli], he said to [Zha Xiaodao],
0:16:6|0:16:18|Twisting the needles on Mo Feli's head, hundreds of fine needles pierced [Mo Feli]'s body and head, like a hedgehog. [Zhe Ergen] turned the fine needles and whispered:
0:16:40|0:16:47|Zha Xiaodao, who was listening attentively on the side, angrily said:
0:17:14|0:17:26|Hypnotized Zha Xiaodao happily walked out along the straight road, Zhe Ergen looked at Zha Xiaodao's back with a cunning smile, the next day Mo Feli was making a phone call outside the venue.
0:18:7|0:18:26|[Zha Xiaodao] hesitated while tightly holding her long coat. Reluctantly, she took off the coat to reveal a shirt with the same flamboyant floral pattern as [Mo Feli]. [Mo Feli] smirked satisfactorily as he took off [Zha Xiaodao]'s glasses, then handed her a pair of sunglasses and put them on her.
0:18:42|0:19:9|[Zha Xiaodao] gritted his teeth, then made a motion of opening his mouth, after a moment of contemplation, he forcefully opened his mouth and stuck out his tongue. Then all his facial features squeezed together. [Mo Feli] took out a roll of tissue and asked in resignation. Holding a torch ice cream, [Mo Feli] shouted loudly across the street to [Zha Xiaodao].
0:19:43|0:20:5|Desperate [Zha Xiaodao] rushed into the fast-moving traffic, stopping at the first dashed line to look around, then darting to the second dashed line. Startled by the vehicles speeding past, [Zha Xiaodao] spun in place several times. While [Mo Feli] was still in shock, [Zha Xiaodao] had already made it to the middle of the road. After looking left and right, gathering courage, [Zha Xiaodao] let out a loud roar and charged towards [Mo Feli] with lightning speed.
0:20:17|0:20:46|Zha Xiaodao looked blankly at the overpass next to him, as Mo Feli, eating a torch, turned away with a look of disdain. After building up their courage, the two of them arrived at the debt-ridden game hall. Wearing sunglasses and flamboyant uniforms, they walked menacingly down the corridor of the game hall. Zha Xiaodao, who had just been trained, swaggered with Mo Feli's baseball bat, showing great momentum.
0:20:46|0:20:54|The fierce-looking duo scared away the surrounding customers, causing Zha Xiaodao to excitedly say to [Mo Feli].
0:21:2|0:21:18|Zha Xiaodao then swayed from side to side, holding a baseball bat in her hand, tossing it back and forth. As soon as she finished speaking, more than ten fierce-looking men with sticks in hand came from all directions in the room, standing behind Zha Xiaodao and imitating her movements.
0:21:21|0:21:27|Mo Feli turned around helplessly, noticing Zha Xiaodao slowly turning his head,
0:21:29|0:21:34|Unable to stand the noise, [Mo Feli] shouted at the woman on the drum set next to him:
0:21:37|0:21:46|After the noise stopped, [Mo Feli] took out a crumpled piece of paper and asked:
0:21:59|0:22:7|[Mo Feli] pretended to look at the words on the paper again.
0:23:2|0:23:12|Finishing speaking, he took off his sunglasses and stared at everyone. It was then revealed that [Mo Feli]'s left eyeball was made of machinery, constantly rotating in the eye socket and emitting a red light. The thugs looked at him in astonishment.
0:23:31|0:23:44|Rui Simo, who had just picked his nose, was about to charge at [Mo Feli], but he pulled out a bottle of wine and smashed it on his own head, the astonishing momentum frightening Rui Simo and the others away.
0:24:57|0:25:5|After listening, [Mo Feli] angrily threw down the bag, picked up a stick, and walked towards Rui Simo.
0:25:10|0:25:23|With a command from [Rui Simo], the thugs rushed forward without hesitation. Faced with the aggressive attackers, [Mo Feli] remained unusually calm, knocking down each one with a slap.
0:25:32|0:25:40|[Mo Feli] covered his hand and kicked the cash-filled box towards [Zha Xiaodao] in frustration, then proceeded to knock down several people in a row. Beside him, Xiaodao gazed dreamily and said:
0:25:50|0:26:16|After Zha Xiaodao pushed the box away, the thugs wielding sticks attacked Mo Feli, but they couldn't harm him at all due to Mo Feli's agile skills. Mo Feli took on ten opponents and had the upper hand, leaping and dodging in the crowd, striking with force. In the end, one man cowered in fear, with four bloody marks on his left cheek from Mo Feli's blows. After knocking him down, Mo Feli turned to face the others, just as they were about to rush towards him.
0:26:17|0:26:38|Everyone stood still upon hearing this. At that moment, Zha Xiaodao, who had taken the wrong path, cut through the crowd. While everyone was still in shock, Mo Feli took the lead and launched an attack, slapping each of the thugs in the face who happened to be standing in a row. With a final punch, he sent the thug at the end flying. Meanwhile, Zha Xiaodao, holding a box, was still walking in a straight line inside the arcade.
0:26:39|0:26:50|After a moment, many thugs were knocked down, leaving only the fat man with a face full of bloodstains, trembling with a big drum in his hand. Finally, he shouted and smashed the drum on himself, fainting on the ground. Seeing this, [Mo Feli] raised his hand and turned to walk towards [Rui Simo].
0:26:57|0:27:9|With a masculine appearance, [Rui Simo] bit her hair coquettishly and said, "After Chen Zhai was recovered, [Rui Simo]'s two subordinates sat on the oven, screaming in pain due to their incompetence."
0:27:10|0:27:18|[Hua Zong] sighed and said:
0:28:9|0:28:30|After collecting debts at the game hall, [Mo Feli] drove his rusty jeep back home. His residence was located in an abandoned factory yard, where numerous pipes intertwined in the vast factory. The yard was overgrown with weeds and rarely visited. [Mo Feli] casually parked the car, got out, and knocked his head with a slightly pained expression.
0:28:30|0:28:53|At this moment, a little white dog ran towards him. [Mo Feli] set down the box containing cash and the baseball bat, sat on the roadside, took out prepared dog food to feed the dog. A rare smile appeared on his face. Just then, there was a noise from the nearby pipe. Cautiously, [Mo Feli] approached slowly, his footsteps lightly treading on the grass, making no sound. He arrived at the pipe, without even looking, kicked towards the inside.
0:29:0|0:29:10|At this moment, the disheveled [Zha Xiaodao] slowly crawled out and pointed to the shoe print on his face, saying:
0:29:33|0:29:38|After that, he followed [Mo Feli] into the dirty and messy basement.
0:30:16|0:30:35|[Zha Xiaodao] curiously followed [Mo Feli]'s instructions and walked forward, but bumped into a pipe after just a few steps. They then walked in single file through the passage. At first, the entrance of the passage was small, but after walking for dozens of steps, it suddenly opened up, revealing a vast expanse of land with buildings scattered around.
0:30:35|0:30:48|[Zha Xiaodao] came out of the passage, unconsciously opening his mouth in surprise as he looked around. He saw pedestrians coming and going, chatting and laughing, leisurely enjoying themselves. He never expected such a lively place beneath the appearance of an abandoned factory, like a paradise on earth.
0:30:48|0:31:3|[Zha Xiaodao] curiously asked [Mo Feli], but [Mo Feli] glanced at her without replying, and continued walking forward. At that moment, a woman with heavy makeup and exaggerated attire bumped into [Mo Feli].
0:31:32|0:31:38|Guo Sisi, feeling bored, noticed Zha Xiaodao standing aside and sarcastically remarked:
0:31:58|0:32:30|The neighbors who were watching the excitement in a row said, "As soon as the words fell, the courtyard was empty." At this moment, [Mo Feli] also closed the door heavily and entered the room. Inside, [Zha Xiaodao] curiously looked at everything. The not-so-small room was filled with all kinds of strange things. [Zha Xiaodao] seemed to completely ignore [Mo Feli]'s warning just now and continued to touch his treasures with great curiosity.
0:32:48|0:32:53|Mo Feli walked up to a bell, about to reach out for it, when [Mo Feli] said to her with his back turned:
0:33:3|0:33:12|The whole room then shook as if in an earthquake.
0:33:37|0:33:44|At this moment, [Mo Feli] is sitting on the bed, wearing an eye mask and earplugs. After taking a sleeping pill and drinking a sip of beer, he is ready to go to sleep.
0:34:30|0:34:39|In the blink of an eye, [Mo Feli] lay down on the ground and fell asleep, while glaring with wide eyes, sitting on the ground with a fierce look, watching [Zha Xiaodao] snoring.
0:34:53|0:34:57|Zha Xiaodao's snoring shook the water on the ground through the pipes,
0:34:59|0:35:15|Mo Feli, feeling helpless, pulled out her trump card. The noisy little pig squealed loudly in her ear, causing Mo Feli to go crazy and start banging her head. Hearing the sound of a stick, Zha Xiaodao muttered in his sleep.
0:35:22|0:35:48|[Mo Feli] slowly put down the stick, looking thoughtfully at Xiaodao. At this moment, another snore broke the brief silence, completely frustrating [Mo Feli], who banged his head against the wall. Meanwhile, in the next room, [Guo Sisi] heard the commotion and with a tearful voice said, "Seeing no more movement, [Guo Sisi] thought it was over."
0:35:48|0:35:56|The next day, Manager Ji brought his men to the slaughterhouse.
0:36:16|0:36:22|Later, known as "Pull Pants Pocket", was sharpening a knife under the pocket, raised his head and said:
0:36:45|0:36:50|He then raised the photo of [Mo Feli], looked at it in his pocket, and remembered what happened at Mount Makalu.
0:36:52|0:37:0|Quickly and neatly knocked the knife out of [Manager Ji]'s hand, and threw his own butcher knife, along with a photo, into the hanging pork. On the other side,
0:37:0|0:37:11|Yesterday's basement was originally called the Sisi Inn, where [Guo Sisi] not only was the landlady, but also ran a barber shop in the inn. The inn seemed small, but housed many people. Their daily lives were both ordinary and exciting.
0:37:32|0:37:44|After scanning the courtyard, they arrived at Mo Feli's home. The little white dog walked up to Zha Xiaodao, who was still sound asleep on the floor, and licked her face. The sunlight shone through the only window in the house onto Zha Xiaodao's face. She groggily opened her eyes and saw the vacant gaze of...
0:37:48|0:37:54|[Zha Xiaodao] looked at the listless [Mo Feli], feeling a bit guilty, lowered his head and found his pants were wet and emitting a strange smell, so he sniffed them.
0:37:58|0:38:17|[Mo Feli] remained motionless in the same position, [Zha Xiaodao] stood up and continued to ask. After a while, [Mo Feli]'s eyelids moved slightly, like a robot, inching his body towards the shelf and throwing a pair of denim shorts at her.
0:38:19|0:38:38|[Zha Xiaodao] ran to change clothes and accidentally stepped on a squeaky toy pig. Startled, [Mo Feli] paused for a moment before picking up some tissue paper and heading towards the restroom. At that moment, [Guo Sisi], with her makeup smudged from crying, stood at the doorway and asked:
0:38:48|0:39:17|[Guo Sisi] leaned against the wall, without turning her head, pretending to be calm. Only after hearing [Mo Feli] walk away did she let down her guard, wailing loudly. Seeing [Zha Xiaodao] wearing [Mo Feli]'s pants, the incredulous [Guo Sisi] screamed, hugged her head, and ran out. [Zha Xiaodao] watched her run out, then looked back in surprise at the sound level meter that was off the charts due to the screaming.
0:39:27|0:39:29|After quickly going through the account book, she thought for a moment,
0:39:33|0:39:39|Later, [Mo Feli] drove with [Zha Xiaodao], who had not slept all night and was yawning in the car. Seeing this, [Zha Xiaodao] reminded him:
0:40:11|0:40:18|Shortly after, [Mo Feli] pressed the button in the car, and the passenger seat slid out of the car.
0:40:50|0:41:3|[Zha Xiaodao], who was hit out of the car, crashed into the hanging fish.
0:41:16|0:41:23|Then the two of you arrived at Zhe Ergen's clinic, where Zhe Ergen boasted:
0:41:32|0:41:41|After [Zha Xiaodao] finished speaking, with his wind-blown messy hair, he took out [Mo Feli]'s account book from his bag and placed it on the table. Upon seeing the account book, [Zhe Ergen]'s face changed drastically.
0:42:16|0:42:23|Mo Feli stormed out angrily afterwards.
0:42:34|0:42:41|After the two left, Manager Ji and Zhe Ergen emerged from the roadside barrier.
0:43:0|0:43:5|In the wax museum, [Lao Ding] waited for [Mo Feli] while bowing his head and talking to the two turtles he brought.
0:43:29|0:43:38|Standing in front of [Lao Ding], unexpectedly, was [Zhe Ergen]. After listening, [Zhe Ergen] revealed an evil smile. Soon, [Mo Feli] arrived at the wax museum with [Zha Xiaodao].
0:43:50|0:43:56|She ran to the wax figure of [Empress Zhenhuan], lost in a trance as she stared at the wax figure, which bore a striking resemblance to [Zha Xiaodao].
0:43:59|0:44:21|Here's an explanation for everyone. The actress who plays [Zha Xiaodao], Sun Li, once played [Empress Zhen Huan]. The wax figure in the wax museum is also made based on Sun Li's face. After looking at the wax figure, the two continue walking forward. At this moment, [Mo Feli] suddenly stops, puts down the backpack, hands the baseball bat to [Zha Xiaodao], and instructs:
0:44:41|0:45:1|Upon waking up, [Mo Feli] cautiously walked up to the second floor. The wax museum was an unfinished building with no guardrails or tiles. [Mo Feli] carefully examined the area where the wax figures were placed on the second floor. Each wax figure was incredibly lifelike. He passed by the wax figures as if expecting trouble, suddenly striking a combat pose. The wax figures around him did not move. After taking a few steps, he quickly turned around.
0:45:6|0:45:31|Highly nervous, [Mo Feli] constantly looked around, inspecting one by one. After circling around, he came to a wax figure holding a cigar. Just as [Mo Feli] lowered his head to light the cigar, a flying knife flashed behind him. The head of the wax figure fell to the ground like a ball. Immediately, [Zha Xiaodao] rushed over. [Mo Feli] agilely dodged, and [Zha Xiaodao] smashed the head of the wax figure with a punch. [Mo Feli] jumped onto [Zha Xiaodao]'s shoulders to prepare for a counterattack, but due to his heavy build, [Mo Feli] was knocked back into a wooden crate.
0:45:31|0:45:56|Above, [Pulling Pants] dragged his leg back and forth on the box, finally lifting [Mo Feli] and throwing him heavily to the side. Downstairs, [Zha Xiaodao] was holding a baseball bat and practicing behind the wall. Meanwhile, upstairs, [Pulling Pants] had already cornered [Mo Feli]. With no way out, [Mo Feli] bumped into a wax figure, causing the spear in the wax figure's hand to fall beside him. After picking up the spear, [Mo Feli] laughed and pointed it at [Pulling Pants]. Seeing this, [Pulling Pants] dared not make any rash moves. Subsequently, [Mo Feli] spun the spear twice and began to stab towards [Pulling Pants].
0:45:56|0:46:12|Unexpectedly, the obese [Mo Feli] displayed agile movements, constantly twisting his body to evade the incoming spears. [Zha Xiaodao] changed tactics and began wildly thrusting towards [Mo Feli]. [Mo Feli] used his knife to continuously block the spears, and finally with a strong blow, he chopped off the spear of the wax figure. After a moment of awkward silence, [Mo Feli] laughed and leaped towards [Zha Xiaodao].
0:46:12|0:46:32|[Mo Feli] instinctively blocked with his spear, which was instantly split in half. Then [Zha Xiaodao] wildly attacked [Mo Feli] with his knife. [Mo Feli] had no choice but to continue blocking with the now broken spear. After a moment, the spear had turned into a candle. Just as [Zha Xiaodao] was about to strike with his knife, [Mo Feli] suddenly lit the candle in his hand.
0:46:46|0:47:2|While clutching his face in pain from being hit in the crotch, [Mo Feli] ran off, as downstairs [Zha Xiaodao] nervously practiced with a baseball bat, mimicking the pose of the nearby Bruce Lee wax figure. Just then, the limping [Mo Feli] disappeared around a corner, leaving the angry [Zha Xiaodao] looking around at the wax figures.
0:47:2|0:47:18|Mo Feli, now in a different outfit, stood still among the wax figures, one hand covering his mouth and the other pointing to the left. As Zha Xiaodao slowly walked past him, Mo Feli took a breath and tried to leave quietly. However, Zha Xiaodao suddenly turned around, causing Mo Feli to quickly change his posture and continue pretending to be a wax figure.
0:47:18|0:47:49|Pulling his pants pocket, it seemed like he thought that the person might be hiding in the wax figure. He then turned around and forcefully broke off the arm of a wax figure next to him. Upon seeing this, [Mo Feli] covered his mouth in panic and retracted his arm. Pulling his pants pocket looked at the puzzled [Mo Feli] and approached to inspect him. After a closer look, he tapped on his belly with his hand. Hearing the hollow sound, he leaned in to smell [Mo Feli]'s belly. [Mo Feli] looked down at Pulling his pants pocket with disdain. At that moment, he suddenly looked up, and [Mo Feli] quickly followed suit to adjust his posture. Pulling his pants pocket, who hadn't found any clues, went to pull [Mo Feli]'s arm that he was covering his mouth with.
0:47:49|0:48:6|[Mo Feli] was pulled by his strength, causing his entire upper body to bend down. Suddenly releasing, [Mo Feli] bounced back to his original position like a rubber man, even shaking realistically. Then, pulling the pocket of his pants with more force, he pulled [Mo Feli]'s arm again. This time, the arm was pulled down and released, bouncing back to its original position once more.
0:48:6|0:48:32|Later, La Ku Dou fiercely punched [Mo Feli] in the chest, but seeing no reaction, he then punched him in the stomach with force. Following that, he aimed a brutal punch at his crotch. [Mo Feli] grimaced but held on. At that moment, La Ku Dou pulled out a short sword and stabbed towards his foot before [Mo Feli] could react. [Mo Feli] gritted his teeth, writhing in pain, and couldn't help but let out a loud scream.
0:48:39|0:49:0|After attacking and robbing, Xike ran out, chasing Mo Feli desperately in the deserted unfinished building. When they reached the stairs on the first floor, Mo Feli shouted: "Mo Feli" and flew out, lying on the ground. Xike, who was closely following, was knocked unconscious by a stick. Mo Feli, watching Xike fall to the ground without even closing his eyes, broke out in a cold sweat. He closed Xike's eyes with his hand and slowly reached out to Zha Xiaodao.
0:49:3|0:49:14|Shortly after, [Mo Feli] and [Zha Xiaodao] hurriedly fled with a box full of cash. As they passed by a group of wax figures, the box accidentally slipped. When they turned back to pick it up, they suddenly felt a chill down their spines. Surrounded by the wax figures, they dared not make any sudden movements. At that moment, a wax figure behind them started to approach.
0:49:14|0:49:34|The two suddenly turned around, the wax figure still standing in place. At this moment, several wax figures behind them also approached. After exchanging a glance, [Mo Feli] grabbed Zha Xiaodao's arm and prepared to rush out. However, the wax figures surrounded them and burst into laughter.
0:49:34|0:49:48|The wax figure was originally played by [Manager Ji] and his subordinates. Meanwhile, [Guo Sisi] was watching TV at home. In the TV show, Shui Sheng was hit by a bullet while trying to protect his loved one. [Guo Sisi] was deeply moved and cried uncontrollably.
0:49:50|0:50:10|The camera slowly turns to Shuisheng on the TV, whose face bears a striking resemblance to [Mo Feli]. Guo Sisi, upon seeing this, spits out her milk tea in shock. Shuisheng strikes a handsome pose for the camera, causing Guo Sisi to cry even harder at the sight of the Mo Feli lookalike. Just then, the commotion outside the door snaps the mesmerized Guo Sisi back to reality, as someone is seen picking the lock at the entrance where [Mo Feli] stands.
0:50:26|0:50:31|With that, taking off the mask revealed [Zhe Ergen], the bruised and swollen [Zhe Ergen] continued speaking:
0:50:44|0:50:53|Upon hearing these words, [Guo Sisi] seemed to be in heaven, ecstatic and laughing wildly, her attitude towards [Zhe Ergen] immediately did a complete 180-degree turn.
0:51:47|0:52:12|Meanwhile, in the wax museum, [Zha Xiaodao] and [Mo Feli] were surrounded at the edge of the third floor without a railing. On the side, [Manager Ji] made a video call to [Hua Zong], tearing off the fake beard on his face and then turning the tablet towards [Zha Xiaodao].
0:53:6|0:53:10|At this moment, Zha Xiaodao glared angrily at Mo Feli with his hands in his pockets.
0:53:25|0:53:53|After stopping the person about to act, he took out a beer bottle from his bag and smashed it towards his own head. Surprisingly, the bottle did not break. [Mo Feli] awkwardly smiled at this, then fiercely smashed it against his head again. Even after the violent hit, the bottle remained intact in [Mo Feli]'s hand. It turned out that the prop bottle that was smashed by [Zha Xiaodao] earlier was replaced with a real one in the bag. Unaware of this, [Mo Feli] shouted loudly.
0:53:55|0:54:3|After being hit three times, [Mo Feli] saw stars and staggered.
0:54:12|0:54:21|[Zha Xiaodao] struck [Mo Feli] with a blow, causing him to crouch on the ground, holding his head and continuously vomiting.
0:54:31|0:54:48|Mo Feli, who gradually realized what was happening, asked, "Manager Ji placed the tablet in his hands in front of his chest, then handed it to the two people beside him."
0:55:42|0:55:50|Mo Feli, in an emotional outburst, finished speaking and then jumped down. While the other three were still in a daze, Mo Feli bounced back up.
0:55:54|0:56:7|On the first floor, there was a huge trampoline. [Mo Feli] was playing around with everyone, jumping up and down. At that moment, [Zha Xiaodao] arrived in a car.
0:56:13|0:56:19|Upon hearing this, [Mo Feli] widened his eyes in surprise and quickly drove away, with everyone else closely following behind.
0:56:32|0:56:42|The two rushed out of the factory, speeding all the way. Outside the factory on the road, [Manager Ji] and his men also drove closely behind, with four cars side by side, tightly following [Mo Feli]'s car.
0:56:43|0:57:13|Mo Feli calmly drifted into the curve, reaching up to pull down the mechanism above his head. The trunk opened, and a large bag of rainbow candies poured out like a flood, covering the road. The rainbow candies caused the two cars behind to slide to the side. Before Mo Feli could enjoy the moment, Zha Xiaodao stumbled and chased after him from a small road, driving alongside Mo Feli's car. Zha Xiaodao and his men gestured provocatively at Mo Feli. Mo Feli watched as Zha Xiaodao let go of the steering wheel, and in response, he also let go of the steering wheel. With a loud shout, Mo Feli forcefully pulled the steering wheel out.
0:57:13|0:57:35|Zha Xiaodao on the side looked at the two in horror. At this moment, Mo Feli also pulled out the steering wheel without backing down, looking triumphantly at Mo Feli. Mo Feli widened her eyes in surprise. Driven by her competitive spirit, Mo Feli shouted and threw the steering wheel out, then turned to yell at Mo Feli. Not willing to admit defeat, Mo Feli also bit her teeth and threw the steering wheel out. Before she could feel victorious, prepared Mo Feli took out a steering wheel the same size as a faucet from his pocket.
0:57:35|0:57:40|With a smug smile on his face, [Mo Feli] waved at [Menglu], then revved up and smoothly maneuvered past the obstacles ahead.
0:57:41|0:57:48|Without a steering wheel, [Mo Feli] could only watch helplessly as the car crashed into the obstacle, flipping in the air twice before landing heavily on the ground.
0:57:49|0:58:16|Upon regaining consciousness, [Zha Xiaodao] saw [Mo Feli]'s mechanical eye hanging on his eyelid. [Zha Xiaodao] cautiously took the mechanical eye off and held it in his hand, looking in horror at the still rotating eye. At that moment, the pants pocket and [Manager Ji]'s car caught up. After a spin, the vehicles arrived back on the road covered in rainbow candy, both cars simultaneously slid and spun 360 degrees before coming to a stop on the road ahead filled with obstacles.
0:58:20|0:59:2|At this moment, [Zha Xiaodao] reached out of the window, frowned and said: [Mo Feli] listened, calmly took a sip of yogurt, then stepped on the gas pedal and rushed forward. As the vehicle was about to reach the obstacle, it reached a speed of 150 miles per hour. The car leaped up the slope of the obstacle, soaring two meters high in the air. The two people in the air widened their eyes, anxiously waiting for the car to land.
0:59:15|0:59:23|After successfully escaping, [Mo Feli] said to [Zha Xiaodao] while relieving himself in the woods:
1:0:0|1:0:7|[Mo Feli] absentmindedly covered his head.
1:0:24|1:0:28|[Mo Feli] looked at the teary-eyed [Zha Xiaodao] without saying a word.
1:0:44|1:1:7|As soon as the words fell, [Mo Feli] drove away quickly. [Zha Xiaodao], who was left behind, walked desolately on the straight road, with a vacant expression and scattered eyes, feeling that she was still not accepted by others.
1:1:7|1:1:16|In the car, [Mo Feli] was casually whistling, but as he whistled, his expression became somewhat reluctant, yet he still pretended to be indifferent.
1:1:16|1:1:23|On the other side, [Zha Xiaodao], who is accustomed to walking in a straight line, slowed down and faintly heard the whistling and car noises behind him.
1:1:24|1:1:36|At this moment, [Mo Feli]'s car swayed and drove up to Xiaodao. The passenger door popped open, and [Mo Feli] leaned out, spraying water on the roof of the car, pretending nonchalantly,
1:1:39|1:1:58|Zha Xiaodao swept away the gloom and nodded happily, then sat joyfully in the passenger seat with the window open. Meanwhile, Mo Feli was driving along the winding path in the quiet forest. In another scene, Hua Zong was welding with an electric welding gun in a factory, while Manager Ji and Zhe Ergen, who were not doing their job well, stood in front of the table, forced to watch the sparks flying during the welding process.
1:2:10|1:2:30|[Hua Zong] put down the welding gun and walked behind the two of them. They were holding their red eyes in pain. After speaking, he raised the sign just welded together with iron wires forming a poop pattern, and then, unable to see clearly due to the shaking, turned towards [Manager Ji].
1:2:47|1:2:54|The indistinct Manager Ji scolded Hua Zong, who was also unclear, saying:
1:3:5|1:3:16|The three of them then excitedly opened the box, only to find a countdown bomb inside. As the countdown reached zero, the bomb suddenly exploded.
1:3:58|1:4:8|Following that, [Mo Feli] began training [Zha Xiaodao], starting with the Iron Head technique. After demonstrating with a prop brick, he pointed to the real bricks stacked in front of them.
1:4:8|1:4:20|Zha Xiaodao turned his neck and bumped into something. The next move was Iron Sand Palm, with Mo Feli poking twice in a pot filled with sand, then gesturing to Zha Xiaodao beside him. However, Xiaodao was faced with a huge and steaming hotpot instead.
1:4:20|1:4:32|In three steps, [Mo Feli] showed Zha Xiaodao his baseball bat skills, accurately hitting the bottle in the air and then handing the bat to Xiaodao. Xiaodao happily took the bat and on the first swing, it hit [Mo Feli] in the face. The third step was to train Xiaodao's accuracy.
1:4:32|1:4:50|[Mo Feli] pressed her hand on the table and swiftly and accurately stabbed between her fingers with a dagger. After the demonstration, Zha Xiaodao, seeing Mo Feli's unharmed hand, began to imitate and quickly stabbed as well. After a series of actions, Mo Feli raised her hand, revealing numerous holes on it. After the training session, Mo Feli and Zha Xiaodao enthusiastically called the neighbors over.
1:4:50|1:4:56|In the courtyard, they started eating hotpot. Zha Xiaodao continued to practice martial arts, using his right hand to pick up vegetables from the hotpot for the neighbors. Everyone chatted and laughed, having a great time.
1:4:59|1:5:20|At night, Xiaodao stood by the only small window in the room, watching the heavy rain outside. Mo Feli handed a pair of glasses to Xiaodao, who took off the glasses given by his mother and said to Mo Feli:
1:6:34|1:6:47|After speaking, Xiaodao looked sadly out the window, and Mo Feli asked, "What's wrong?"
1:7:13|1:7:22|[Mo Feli] nodded thoughtfully after listening, while Zha Xiaodao put on his glasses and shifted his gaze from the window to Mo Feli, asking:
1:7:49|1:7:57|Mo Feli begins to recall his childhood experiences.
1:9:0|1:9:7|[Mo Feli] and Zha Xiaodao looked somewhat melancholy as they gazed out the window. While Xiaodao was lost in childhood memories, [Mo Feli] walked over to the phonograph.
1:9:10|1:9:18|[Mo Feli] takes off the protective cover on the cartridge, unlocks the tonearm, and gently places the needle on the record on the phonograph, causing the record to automatically rotate.
1:9:50|1:10:14|The two lay on the carpet, closing their eyes and listening attentively to the voices of their childhood. When they opened their eyes, they both traveled back to Mo Feli's childhood. In Mo Feli's childhood, he wore a fishbowl on his head and walked through the alley filled with the breath of life. He watched the old man playing chess in the alley, the neighbor aunt cutting hair, and his classmates playing with sticks. Every corner around him was filled with emotion and nostalgia.
1:10:14|1:10:33|In the blink of an eye, he climbed up the wall, took the bell hanging in the house, and happily shook it towards [Zha Xiaodao] and the adult [Mo Feli]. [Mo Feli] smiled, tapped his head to his childhood self, and the young [Mo Feli] also tapped his head in response. The soft sunlight shone in the alley, gently spreading in every corner, evoking a strong sense of nostalgia.
1:10:33|1:10:54|It turned out that time travel was just a dream shared by the two. The next morning, the weather was exceptionally good, with clear skies and a gentle breeze. The swing in the courtyard swayed softly, and the sound of water dripping from the tap could be heard. These easily overlooked sounds were the sounds of life. At home, the little white dog ran over and licked awake [Mo Feli], who was sound asleep.
1:11:57|1:12:7|Mo Feli, who was eating walnuts, suddenly froze, unwilling to believe as he looked at Zha Xiaodao, then turned to the fruit peel on the table. His expression gradually became fierce, his body trembling, and he spat out the half-chewed walnut.
1:12:47|1:12:56|Just then, La Kudou walked into the courtyard with a locator, and [Guo Sisi] holding a photo of [Zhe Ergen] asked [Zha Xiaodao]:
1:13:3|1:13:12|In the next room, Mo Feli was playing games and eavesdropping on the conversation between the two from time to time, while at this time, Zha Xiaodao also successfully found Mo Feli's car.
1:13:51|1:13:59|Zha Xiaodao, who was knocked down, stood up and continued speaking with his back to Guo Sisi:
1:14:15|1:14:20|When Xiaodao turned around, he found Guo Sisi being choked unconscious on the ground.
1:14:33|1:15:2|Playing the game, [Mo Feli] was completely unaware of what was happening. The calm Zha Xiaodao picked up the iron box next to him and smashed it towards him. Xiaodao subconsciously glanced at the package, laughed loudly after seeing Xiaodao's small movements, then without even looking, threw the package out of the window. Suddenly, an abnormal vehicle alarm popped up on [Mo Feli]'s phone.
1:15:2|1:15:9|After the fat man struggled to climb out of the small window, he found that his bag had been taken by [Manager Ji]. They then returned to [Hua Zong].
1:15:14|1:15:22|During the argument between the two, [Hua Zong] happily opened the bag, only to find it filled with ghost money. It turned out that the money had been stolen by [Zhe Ergen].
1:15:45|1:16:28|When [Zhe Ergen] switched the money and left a note inside the bag, [Hua Zong] read it and burst into laughter. Pointing at the name on the note, he realized what had happened. [Mo Feli] packed up the gear and said to Xiaodao, "Just as he finished speaking, he looked up to see his car overturned. In the distance, the roar of an engine could be heard, a deep sound that made adrenaline surge. They looked in the direction of the sound and saw a luxurious two-seater sports car pulling up in front of them."
1:16:28|1:17:3|A man in a suit stepped out and said, "Just as he finished speaking, the driver lifted a small motorcycle from the trunk and rode up to ask, " The driver handed the motorcycle to [Mo Feli] with a look of disdain, and then [Mo Feli] put on a helmet and goggles and sped down the road. Sitting behind him with a helmet on, Zha Xiaodao closed her eyes in fear, with her hands resting on [Mo Feli]'s shoulders.
1:17:3|1:17:23|Thinking that [Mo Feli] was driving fast, but constantly being overtaken by the car next to him, at this moment, a sexy girl on a large motorcycle caught up from behind. After riding side by side with the two, she glanced at [Mo Feli] wearing a green helmet and then accelerated past him. [Mo Feli] shouted at the girl in front of him, twisted the throttle to the maximum, caught up with her, and when the girl stopped at a red light, [Mo Feli] slowly pulled up next to her.
1:17:23|1:17:41|After taking off his sunglasses, [Mo Feli] raised his eyebrows and whistled at the spicy girl. The girl smiled and threw a flirtatious glance at him, saying, "You're a little slow on the uptake." [Mo Feli] hesitated for a moment, then slowly turned his head to look behind him, only to see Zha Xiaodao lying on the ground. Zha Xiaodao struggled to stand up with a hand on his waist, limping towards him.
1:17:43|1:17:46|Downstairs at the clinic, Manager Ji and [Mo Feli] are interrogating the neighbors.
1:17:50|1:18:11|On the second floor, [Zhe Ergen] looked flustered as he pondered a plan of action. Later, he went to the clinic with a photo in hand, comparing it to the faces of the employees while pressuring them. The female nurse timidly finished speaking and then compared the photo to another employee's face, and then to the face of [Zhe Ergen], who was already dressed up as a nurse. With heavy makeup on, [Zhe Ergen] nervously cleared his throat and said:
1:18:15|1:18:22|At this moment, Laku Dou found Mo Feli's ID card in the drawer, and Manager Ji snatched it away.
1:18:29|1:18:34|While the two were fighting, [Zhe Ergen] quietly ran out and bumped into [Mo Feli] who had just arrived at the gate.
1:19:8|1:19:21|[Mo Feli] shook off [Zhe Ergen]'s hand and said, "[Zhe Ergen]" ran back into the house in fear. [Manager Ji] took out a knife and said:
1:19:36|1:19:51|Zhe Ergen ran into the room, pulled the trigger, and the bag full of cash fell to the ground. At this time, Manager Ji in the courtyard had already been beaten up easily, lying motionless in the car. Pulling up his pants, he turned to Mo Feli and said:
1:20:13|1:20:22|As soon as the words fell, Zhe Ergen jumped from the second floor and landed right on top of Mo Feli's head. Getting up in a panic, Zhe Ergen said:
1:20:31|1:20:46|Unexpectedly, [Zha Xiaodao] knocked Zhe Ergen unconscious with an old method of using a stick. Later, in the restaurant, Xiaodao picked up a plate and ate voraciously, shocking the customers nearby. [Mo Feli] thought for a moment and then said:
1:21:12|1:21:29|Mo Feli, who was still chewing his food, stood up and approached the boss lady with disdain. He deliberately moved closer and adjusted his jacket before striking a pose, saying:
1:21:43|1:21:47|[Zha Xiaodao] bowed to the burly men around him, picked up his motorcycle helmet, and said to the boss lady:
1:22:4|1:22:23|In the classroom, Zha Xiaodao's mother is teaching elementary students a lesson. Students in the back row seem to sense someone behind them, slowly looking out the window. They see Mo Feli outside, wearing a school uniform, a red scarf, and carrying a small backpack, floating past the window. After a while, he changes position and floats back like a ghost.
1:22:23|1:22:30|The students were all drawn to the mischievous Mo Feli, looking in surprise towards the window, while Teacher Zhang was still focused on reading the text.
1:23:37|1:23:42|After finishing speaking, [Zha Xiaodao] turned and walked back to the classroom. Feeling dejected, he lowered his head to leave, and [Mo Feli] walked over from the side.
1:24:0|1:24:9|Encouraged and commanded by [Mo Feli], [Zha Xiaodao] walked towards the classroom, at which point a naked child shouted:
1:24:22|1:24:30|[Zha Xiaodao] looked at his angry mother, took a step forward, lowered his head, and apologized sincerely:
1:25:1|1:25:21|After finishing speaking, [Teacher Zhang] looked at his mother, still unresponsive, with a stern face looking to the side. [Zha Xiaodao] lowered his head and said, "After a moment of silence, he raised his head and looked into [Teacher Zhang]'s eyes, repeating the words he had always wanted to say. With red eyes, [Zha Xiaodao] finished speaking and then turned and left, following [Mo Feli] towards the school gate with a sense of melancholy. At this moment, [Teacher Zhang] caught up.
1:25:28|1:25:36|The two silent figures stopped in their tracks upon hearing this, turned around slowly, and [Teacher Zhang] quickly walked towards them. Before [Zha Xiaodao] could say anything, a bundle of cash was stuffed into her hands by [Teacher Zhang]. Before the two could react, [Teacher Zhang] had already returned to the classroom.
1:25:38|1:26:1|Back in the classroom, [Teacher Zhang] picked up the eraser in a daze. After dropping it on the floor, she then hesitated with the chalk in hand, trying to write on the blackboard. After just a few strokes, she didn't know what to write anymore. At this moment, the resentment towards her daughter in [Teacher Zhang]'s heart had dissipated, and the once strong [Teacher Zhang] could no longer hide her love. She sobbed on the blackboard, her body trembling along with her emotions.
1:26:2|1:26:11|[Teacher Zhang] wrote the title of the text "A Mother's Love" in big letters on the blackboard, and at that moment, all the emotions that had been pent up for years in their hearts were released.
1:26:11|1:26:26|As a mother, [Teacher Zhang] squatted on the ground and cried loudly. [Zha Xiaodao] stood at the school gate, looking straight ahead in the direction his mother left, tears falling from his eyes one by one. On the side, [Mo Feli] watched the mother and daughter reconcile, showing a relieved smile.
1:26:26|1:26:35|Regaining consciousness, [Zha Xiaodao] also broke into a smile. Meanwhile, in the company, [Hua Zong] was jogging, with everyone applauding. Two employees were laying out a red carpet in front, with [Manager Ji] and Lao Kudou following behind.
1:27:0|1:27:15|After that, he continued to run forward, while the disguised [Lao Ding] heard what [Hua Zong] said and muttered to himself: Then he lurked into Sisi's inn, where Sisi was washing a guest's hair. At that moment, [Mo Feli] and [Zha Xiaodao] returned.
1:27:50|1:28:20|Guo Sisi, who rushed over, was knocked unconscious by a turtle shell. She said she would throw the turtle towards Mo Feli, but it was caught by Lao Ding. After explaining the situation, Lao Ding sat on the ground and cried out to everyone.
1:29:41|1:30:6|[Mo Feli] listened to the words he once said to Xiaodao, slowly turned his head, looked at Xiaodao with a determined look. Beside them, the movie poster of "The Old Man and the Sea" displayed this bold statement. [Guo Sisi] stood up first, nodded at Mo Feli affirmatively. Everyone looked at the increasingly resolute Mo Feli, took a step forward together. After entering the room, they left everyone standing still in astonishment.
1:30:7|1:30:10|The crowd dispersed after seeing the situation.
1:30:10|1:30:19|In the afternoon at Hua Zong's factory, numerous security guards, in groups of five, were patrolling closely with batons in hand. In a corner, Zha Xiaodao and Lao Ding were quietly planning.
1:30:40|1:30:47|[Zha Xiaodao] swiftly shuttles through the high and low platforms, [Lao Ding] watches [Zha Xiaodao]'s agile movements with secret joy in his heart.
1:30:52|1:31:10|As soon as the words fell, [Zha Xiaodao], who had just been somersaulting, fell on the ground with all four legs up, and after getting up in a sorry state, quickly got into position. He hid behind a large machine part, carefully observing the situation outside. Seeing a security guard on the other side of the wall, he prepared to go around from the other side. As he walked over, he tilted his head and saw another security guard passing by in the corridor.
1:31:10|1:31:31|Discovering security guards everywhere, [Zha Xiaodao] panicked and retreated. At that moment, a man in a security guard uniform stood behind her. When [Zha Xiaodao] turned around anxiously with her mouth open, he quickly used the knife's teeth to pry open the bottle cap. After calming down, [Zha Xiaodao] realized that the person was actually [Mo Feli]. Subsequently, [Mo Feli] also changed [Zha Xiaodao]'s outfit to a security guard uniform.
1:31:46|1:31:54|After speaking, [Mo Feli] took out his phone and started playing a game.
1:32:9|1:32:15|Watching as Guo Sisi rushed into the room with her phone, she froze in place, looking fearfully at Hua Zong and the other two. Then, she quickly pretended to be blind.
1:32:33|1:32:53|[Guo Sisi] saw initial success and boldly turned her head towards them, continuing to pretend to be blind and shouted: After saying that, she turned and walked away, only to be grabbed by [Hua Zong].
1:33:1|1:33:10|Facing the severe torture of having 10 fingers clamped with bamboo sticks and forcefully pulled, [Guo Sisi] still refused to reveal a single word.
1:33:38|1:33:46|The scene of pinching fingers just now was from a video.
1:34:8|1:34:24|On the other side, [Mo Feli] and [Zha Xiaodao] have sneaked into [Hua Zong]'s office. [Mo Feli] looks serious, slowing down his movements, lifting his leg slowly and taking a step forward. [Zha Xiaodao] quickly catches on and follows suit, taking a step as well.
1:34:46|1:35:5|At this moment, [Hua Zong] and a few others dragged [Guo Sisi] out. Just as they stepped out, they were stopped in their tracks by the neighbors holding pots and pans, ready to fight, blocking the entrance to [Mo Feli]'s house. Upon seeing this, [Guo Sisi] immediately became arrogant.
1:35:25|1:35:38|Just as [Guo Sisi] finished retaliating against the four of them and turned around laughing, she suddenly saw a large group of black-clothed people rushing in from the doorway. Before [Guo Sisi] could close her laughing mouth, the neighbors were already surrounded, and [Hua Zong] and the others, brushing off their previous fear, began to show their might.
1:35:38|1:35:46|Guo Sisi saw the situation was not good, and with a clever move, she started directing.
1:35:47|1:36:11|Everyone followed [Guo Sisi]'s gestures and clapped the pots and pans in their hands. When the music started, [Hua Zong] became interested and began to sway his hands, conducting. Soon, the music stopped with [Hua Zong]'s closing gesture. While [Hua Zong] was still enjoying with his eyes closed, the little girl started playing the pipa again. Everyone looked panicked and confused.
1:36:11|1:36:42|[Hua Zong] opened his eyes and impatiently pointed at the little girl's pipa. He walked up, grabbed the pipa from her pants pocket, and threw it heavily onto the old pipe above her head. The aged pipe broke under the impact, and a large amount of thick smoke sprayed out from the crack. In an instant, the entire inn was shrouded in thick smoke. In the courtyard where you couldn't see your hand in front of your face, everyone scattered and fled. Unable to catch anyone, [Hua Zong]'s men angrily smashed everything in the courtyard. The homes where everyone had lived for many years were ruthlessly destroyed, even the big geese in the courtyard flapped their wings.
1:36:42|1:36:50|It's like a protest. Meanwhile, in the office, the two of them sat on a pile of account books, flipping through them one by one.
1:37:16|1:37:22|At this moment, [Mo Feli] recalled the tone of voice used by [Hua Zong] in the wax museum.
1:37:33|1:37:53|As the secret door slowly opened, a glass wall filled with dolls appeared in front of the two. [Mo Feli] excitedly pulled [Zha Xiaodao] to walk in and take a look. In the archive room, the two looked bewildered at the dazzling array of dolls. From front to back, they found nothing else except dolls. Just when the two were at a loss, [Hua Zong] and his men found [Zhe Ergen] hiding in the warehouse.
1:37:53|1:38:14|After catching his parrot, [Hua Zong] lay down next to the sleeping [Zhe Ergen]. With a snore, he turned over and his arm naturally rested on [Hua Zong]. Half asleep, [Zhe Ergen] vaguely felt something beside him. He reached out and touched [Hua Zong]'s beard, then opened his eyes in shock. Startled, [Zhe Ergen], [Guo Sisi], and the parrot were tied to a chair. Speaking softly, [Guo Sisi] said to [Zhe Ergen]:
1:38:23|1:38:28|At this moment, his henchmen also found the hidden cash.
1:39:9|1:39:29|Seeing [Manager Ji] and Lao Kuadou walking towards them, smiling and flipping their hair, they said in surprise, "Lao Kuadou was punched right away." At the same time, the two in the secret room also got a clue. [Zha Xiaodao] picked up a doll and opened its base, revealing a ledger inside. [Mo Feli] saw it and also found a ledger in his doll. After a quick look, Xiaodao exclaimed:
1:39:37|1:39:45|At this moment, outside the office, [Lao Ding] is hiding in a corner. He peeks through a crack and sees the security guard passing by. He uses his phone to report the situation outside to [Zha Xiaodao].
1:39:53|1:39:58|At this time, the security guard heard the noise and discovered [Lao Ding], then the security guards in the warehouse quickly assembled and rushed out in force.
1:40:26|1:40:36|At this moment, a familiar voice reached Mo Feli's ears,
1:40:54|1:41:10|[Zha Xiaodao] habitually raised her hand to shield her head, but [Mo Feli] did not hit her. Instead, his expression was filled with joy and relief. After quietly watching Xiaodao for a moment, he slowly reached out and held her hand. Xiaodao, feeling the touch, looked up at [Mo Feli] in disbelief. After a brief moment, [Mo Feli] earnestly said:
1:41:37|1:41:40|At this moment, lively music suddenly started playing.
1:41:42|1:41:53|[Mo Feli] heard it and began to sway his body along with the music, looking at the shy Zha Xiaodao with a smile. He reached out his hand inviting her to join in, and Xiaodao slowly extended her hand, her cheeks blushing slightly.
1:41:53|1:42:26|Led by [Mo Feli], the two danced recklessly on the neon-lit rooftop. As Zha Xiaodao danced more and more excitedly, he said, "[Mo Feli]" watched quietly as Zha Xiaodao danced without any order. With a gentle look in [Mo Feli]'s eyes that had never been seen before, a slight smile appeared on his lips. After staring at the silly Zha Xiaodao for a while, [Mo Feli] also joined in, following Zha Xiaodao's dance steps and dancing wildly together.
1:42:26|1:42:36|[Zha Xiaodao] saw [Mo Feli] following him in dancing randomly, which made him even happier. The two of them jumped up and down on the not-so-big rooftop, sometimes splashing in the puddle, sometimes waving the blanket.
1:42:36|1:42:42|At this moment, the two of them cast aside all their worries and enjoy this moment of happiness that belongs only to them.
1:42:42|1:42:49|During the time they got to know each other, the two individuals were changing each other, from initially disliking each other to becoming indispensable in each other's lives.
1:42:49|1:43:11|As [Zhe Ergen] said, the two of them were each other's medicine. After dancing for a long time, they lay on the rooftop with exhaustion and joy. Under the moonlight and neon lights, it seemed particularly romantic. However, not long after lying down, [Mo Feli] fell asleep. [Zha Xiaodao] stared blankly at the stars in the night sky, and it took her a while to come back to her senses. She looked at the snoring [Mo Feli] beside her, confirmed that he was asleep, and gently took out a decibel meter from her pocket, blowing on it.
1:43:11|1:43:30|After seeing Mo Feli not making a sound, Zha Xiaodao put down the decibel meter and confirmed in a low voice: "Mo Feli is motionless."
1:43:52|1:44:7|After muttering to himself, he turned very carefully to lie on his side facing [Mo Feli], gazing at [Mo Feli]'s face with a foolish expression. After a while, he smiled happily and said:
1:44:16|1:44:30|After speaking softly, she raised her head slightly and looked at [Mo Feli]'s face. The eyes of [Zha Xiaodao] were full of affection as she shyly pouted and said:
1:44:44|1:44:56|[Zha Xiaodao], blushing after confessing quietly, was about to go to sleep. At this moment, [Mo Feli] slowly opened his eyes and looked to the side, lips tightly closed, suppressing a smile of happiness. Suddenly, the vibration of the phone interrupted the two of them.
1:45:7|1:45:24|[Mo Feli] answered the phone with a serious expression, then the two hurried back home. [Mo Feli] and [Zha Xiaodao] walked heavily step by step in the yard that looked like a ruin. They looked at the mess in front of them. The once lively and peaceful yard now had no vitality. Everyone lay on the ground with varying degrees of injuries.
1:45:28|1:45:44|[Mo Feli] stooped down to pick up the bell that had been flattened on the ground, carrying a large bag of account books on his back. Looking at the bell and then at the neighbors who were affected, [Mo Feli] suppressed his anger and walked over to the crying child to offer comfort, when the phone rang.
1:45:58|1:46:19|Mo Feli, who couldn't contain his anger, gave Zha Xiaodao a meaningful look after hanging up the phone. Zha Xiaodao immediately understood and changed his equipment. The two of them hid the account book and without hesitation, they rushed over. Both of their expressions were particularly serious, filled with anger and the determination to seek revenge for their neighbors. Even though they knew the odds were against them, there was not a hint of hesitation in their actions.
1:46:19|1:46:27|Suspiciously, as they reached the entrance of the factory, [Mo Feli] grabbed [Zha Xiaodao], snatched the baseball bat and backpack, and said to the bewildered [Zha Xiaodao]:
1:46:44|1:46:50|[Mo Feli] handed a cloth bag to Zha Xiaodao, then went off alone. Xiaodao watched his back with concern, and when he opened the bag, he found a handgun inside.
1:47:14|1:47:43|Before La Kudou could finish speaking, [Zha Xiaodao] fell from the sky in front of the three of them. Taking matters into his own hands, [Zha Xiaodao] slowly got up and cautiously surveyed the surroundings, completely unaware that the enemy was right behind him. As La Kudou carried the unsuccessful [Zha Xiaodao] past the bound Zhe Ergen and the others, Zhe Ergen, Guo Sisi, and Lao Ding were all gagged, anxiously watching [Zha Xiaodao]. After a moment, [Zha Xiaodao] and the others were all bound in different locations according to the plan, in the complex factory filled with a large number of steel pipes.
1:47:43|1:47:57|[Hua Zong] anxiously called [Mo Feli], and at that moment, [Mo Feli]'s voice came through.
1:49:36|1:49:49|At [Hua Zong]'s command, his subordinates all emerged from the shadows. In an instant, the empty factory was crowded with people. However, the henchmen were occasionally tricked by the traps left by [Mo Feli]. At that moment, the words spoken by [Mo Feli] lingered in [Zha Xiaodao]'s ears.
1:50:25|1:50:49|At this moment, [Mo Feli] crashed through the iron gate in a car, causing [Zha Xiaodao] to shout in excitement. Dozens of security guards rushed over, wielding batons and charging towards [Mo Feli]. However, [Mo Feli] activated the self-driving mode, climbed out of the car, stood on the roof as it moved forward, holding four bottles of processed cola, and laughed as the crowd approached.
1:50:49|1:51:9|Approaching, Mo Feli opened the switch, causing the carbon dioxide in the cola bottle to rapidly rise, shooting towards the enemies like bullets. The careless henchmen were seen being thrown out one by one, falling to the ground in pain. As the cola bottle was depleted, a large number of henchmen were knocked down. At this moment, Mo Feli, who was well prepared, pulled the trigger and the trunk opened immediately.
1:51:9|1:51:25|A large amount of rainbow candies poured out, instantly forming a rainbow-like road behind the car. The remaining henchmen chasing behind the car were caught off guard and slipped, falling heavily to the ground. [Mo Feli] cleverly and effortlessly dealt with dozens of henchmen, then gracefully jumped out of the car, carrying a baseball bat, and slowly walked towards [Zha Xiaodao] on the steps.
1:51:27|1:51:53|Mo Feli looked at Zha Xiaodao triumphantly, striking a handsome pose before rescuing Zha Xiaodao and running out. At that moment, Hua Zong and his men blocked their way. When Zha Xiaodao pulled out a gun, the men who had just rushed out quickly retreated behind Hua Zong. Seeing the others retreat, Mo Feli confidently walked up to Hua Zong with a baseball bat, teasing him with it.
1:52:18|1:52:40|With a gunshot, [Hua Zong] and the others crouched in fear on the ground. After a moment, they realized that no one was shot. They slowly stood up and looked down at themselves to confirm. Feeling something wrong with his body, [Mo Feli] turned slowly and saw a long needle stuck in his shoulder. [Mo Feli] turned around slowly, frowning, looking helpless and puzzled, and asked the bewildered [Zha Xiaodao]:
1:52:52|1:53:6|Before the words had even fallen, another needle was stuck in Mo Feli's neck. Mo Feli turned around again, pointing at the needle on his neck in disbelief, and asked, "
1:53:31|1:53:39|The people across the way laughed and picked up the stick on the ground, [Hua Zong] also smiled and said to [Zha Xiaodao]:
1:53:43|1:53:49|After a moment of contemplation, [Zha Xiaodao] raised his gun and loudly exclaimed:
1:54:8|1:54:28|After speaking, he hid behind his men and kept changing positions to provoke Xiaodao: At this moment, the BGM belonging to [Zha Xiaodao] played again, [Zha Xiaodao]'s brain rapidly calculated the distance, range, wind direction, and angle, and within a few seconds, dozens of formulas based on these factors formed in her mind.
1:54:28|1:54:34|After the calculations were completed, Zha Xiaodao slowly raised his hands holding the gun above his head, forming a perfect parabola.
1:54:47|1:54:56|Seeing Zha Xiaodao's precise marksmanship, his subordinates dropped their clubs in fear. At that moment, Guo Sisi led the others to arrive.
1:54:58|1:55:10|Guo Sisi strode forward with a cup of milk tea in hand, followed closely by Lao Ding holding a turtle. Neighbors came with brooms in hand, and bringing up the rear were employees of Hua Zong. Hundreds of people marched behind Zha Xiaodao.
1:55:34|1:56:5|Standing in the room, [Zhe Ergen] shouted loudly, then threw the company's bills towards the crowd in handfuls, with a large amount of paper falling like snowflakes. Seeing this scene, [Lao Ding] tightly held the bills and cried out in pain. His years of fruitless debt collection efforts were like these snow-like bills. At this moment, [Hua Zong] covered his throat and said strugglingly before fainting to the ground. The thugs, seeing this, also held their heads and squatted on the ground. After the villains received their retribution, [Zha Xiaodao] held the fainting [Mo Feli], and [Zhe Ergen] pulled out the needle from his head. [Zha Xiaodao] said:
1:56:29|1:57:1|Neighbors took away the heartbroken [Guo Sisi], leaving only [Mo Feli] and [Zha Xiaodao] in the courtyard. [Zha Xiaodao] looked at [Mo Feli] happily and said, gently moving [Mo Feli]'s head from his lap to the steps, lying down next to [Mo Feli] with their heads together on the ground. After lying down, [Zha Xiaodao] lovingly looked at [Mo Feli] and closed his eyes with a happy smile.
1:57:2|1:57:15|The factory, which was originally filled with constant noise, was unusually quiet at this moment, accompanied by the faint snoring of [Mo Feli] and [Zha Xiaodao].
