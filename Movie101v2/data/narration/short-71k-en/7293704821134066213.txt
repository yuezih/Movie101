0:0:59|0:1:19|In a misty forest, towering ancient trees reach high into the sky as if they have existed for hundreds of years. However, not far away, three people with chainsaws are moving through the woods, constantly looking around and selecting the most suitable targets.
0:1:20|0:1:24|The mist in the forest was thick, as if nature itself was trying to stop the three of them.
0:1:24|0:1:30|But in this operation, the three of them were determined, only concerned with searching everywhere for big trees that could make money.
0:1:30|0:1:36|Not long after, they arrived at a tall and sturdy tree, and [Su Lin], who was walking at the front, spoke up.
0:1:39|0:1:50|[Yang Tianfang] watched as his father walked up and carefully observed the tree. It was indeed larger than the others, with a thick trunk reaching high into the sky. Just as he was about to take action, he heard someone next to him say.
0:1:53|0:1:56|Looking ahead, there are also several good-looking targets in the distance.
0:1:56|0:2:7|After the target was confirmed, [Yang Tianfang] started the chainsaw and began to prepare for logging, continuously emitting the roaring sound of the chainsaw, creating a sharp contrast with the tranquil and peaceful forest.
0:2:7|0:2:14|[Tan Qing] slowly pushed the high-speed running chainsaw into the trunk, and the sap oozed out from the bark, flowing down the chainsaw slowly.
0:2:15|0:2:23|Using a chainsaw to cut down trees is as easy as cutting tofu, without any obstacles. In no time, a large tree as thick as a person fell down with a loud crash.
0:2:23|0:2:31|Following one tree after another, the three of them took down all the previously stained wood, this time their not-so-covert operation gradually caught the attention of someone.
0:2:32|0:2:37|In another office, a mysterious person is tapping on the table, deep in thought.
0:2:37|0:2:41|After hesitating for a moment, [Tan Qing] picked up the phone and dialed 110.
0:2:41|0:2:46|And at that moment, the three of them were leisurely loading the felled timber onto the van.
0:2:51|0:2:56|After finishing loading the car, they did not leave immediately, but rested in place.
0:2:56|0:3:3|But what they didn't know was that the police department, upon receiving the report, had promptly responded and was rushing to the scene in a car.
0:3:3|0:3:8|The three of them, Tan Qing, Su Lin, and Ma Dongmei, were still resting leisurely in the same place, unaware of what was happening.
0:3:35|0:3:40|[Ding Shun] that guy, bought a batch of wood from Manzhouli and just left it there without moving it.
0:3:46|0:3:53|If the wood segments collected from outside are not up to standard, he will process the internal memory, and the production will not stop at all.
0:4:40|0:4:44|After playing around for a while, the three of them walked towards the car parked on the side of the road.
0:4:44|0:4:48|This is a large jeep with plenty of space to put things.
0:4:48|0:4:52|Tan Qing, Su Lin, and another person drove away in a car with the freshly cut wood.
0:4:52|0:4:56|They had no awareness of the consequences they were about to face.
0:4:56|0:5:1|At the same time, outside the office, a man is carefully examining a photo.
0:5:1|0:5:6|In the photo is a delicate-looking girl, and the man looks at the photo with a lecherous smile.
0:5:7|0:5:12|At this moment, the three people who escaped from the scene are still driving away.
0:5:12|0:5:14|Suddenly, they spotted the police on the road.
0:5:18|0:5:21|The crowd rubbed their eyes and took a closer look.
0:5:41|0:5:44|The car screeched to a sudden stop, and [Yang Tianfang] said to his friend.
0:5:55|0:6:0|The two friends left first, leaving [Yang Tianfang] to continue driving alone.
0:6:0|0:6:4|Not long after the car drove away, it encountered the police coming towards them.
0:6:4|0:6:11|[Yang Tianfang] stepped on the gas pedal and drove past the police car, at this moment the police also noticed something unusual, turned their heads and chased after.
0:6:11|0:6:19|The two cars raced one after the other on this narrow country road, the intense chase breaking the bottleneck of the forest.
0:6:19|0:6:22|Under the pursuit of the police, [Yang Tianfang] was finally captured.
0:6:22|0:6:25|Later, the girlfriend [Tan Qing] and mother received news of [Yang Tianfang]'s arrest.
0:6:29|0:6:33|[Tan Qing] took the notification letter and examined it carefully.
0:6:39|0:6:40|[Tan Qing] puts away the notice.
0:6:52|0:6:57|After settling [Yang Tianfang]'s mother, she set off to find an acquaintance for help.
0:6:57|0:7:2|[Tan Qing] arrived at a run-down factory, looking like it was poorly managed and in a desolate state.
0:7:2|0:7:7|But inside the factory, there is a delicately decorated office, creating a strong contrast between the two.
0:7:9|0:7:14|[Tan Qing] hesitated at the door for a long time, but finally made up her mind and walked in.
0:7:14|0:7:26|And the so-called acquaintance inside is none other than the factory director [Ding Shun], who has been pestering him for years.
0:7:26|0:7:29|[Ding Shun] arranged for [Tan Qing] to sit down.
0:7:30|0:7:34|[Tan Qing] sat down slowly, looking a bit awkward and constrained.
0:7:34|0:7:38|[Ding Shun] brought water over, handing it to him with a smile on his face.
0:7:51|0:7:54|Upon hearing this number, he appeared somewhat hesitant.
0:8:11|0:8:16|Upon hearing that it was for treating an old lady, he immediately changed his attitude and prepared to withdraw money.
0:8:16|0:8:22|At this moment, [Tan Qing] was also very troubled, lying is not good, but at least she managed to borrow some money.
0:8:22|0:8:28|[Tan Qing] came out of the factory and went to the police station to pay the fine.
0:8:28|0:8:30|The police officer took the list and confirmed the information.
0:8:32|0:8:37|After understanding the basic situation, the police officers began to fill out the fine payment form.
0:8:37|0:8:45|The whole process was handled very efficiently. After filling in the basic information and double-checking, we could take the form to the bank to pay the fine.
0:8:50|0:8:54|After leaving the police station, [Tan Qing] looked at the fine ticket with a serious expression.
0:8:54|0:8:58|[Yang Tianfang] risked stealing from the neighbor's tomb for his own sake.
0:8:58|0:9:2|And now, this money seems to have become his own debt.
0:9:2|0:9:5|How to face [Ding Shun] in the future also needs to be considered.
0:9:5|0:9:9|After paying the fine and undergoing educational reform, [Yang Tianfang] was finally released.
0:9:11|0:9:16|He went to the mountains with [Tan Qing] to relax and relieve some recent troubles.
0:9:16|0:9:19|They chatted and laughed along the way, creating a relaxed atmosphere.
0:9:19|0:9:25|During the conversation, [Tan Qing] mentioned that he wanted to go out to work to ease the financial pressure at home.
0:9:35|0:9:39|[Yang Tianfang] turned around and looked at his beloved girlfriend, [Tan Qing], tenderly saying.
0:9:43|0:9:56|Speak up, [Yang Tianfang] gently kissed [Tan Qing]'s forehead, then the two embraced each other, with [Tan Qing] leaning on [Yang Tianfang]'s shoulder.
0:9:56|0:9:59|After speaking, they looked at each other and smiled happily.
0:10:0|0:10:7|The setting sun behind them outlined their figures, as if blessing this couple with mutual understanding.
0:10:7|0:10:16|As the sun sets in the west, casting its rays over the city below the mountains, [Yang Tianfang] decisively leaves the land that raised him, as well as the people closest to him.
0:10:22|0:10:26|Time flies, it has been several years since [Yang Tianfang] went out to work.
0:10:26|0:10:31|For various reasons, [Yang Tianfang] may have lost contact with his mother and girlfriend for a long time.
0:10:31|0:10:40|At this moment, a train slowly pulled into the platform, and waiting outside to greet it were the two brothers who had previously gone to the neighbor's house with [Yang Tianfang].
0:10:40|0:10:45|They kept sweeping the inside of the car on the platform, waiting for the train to slowly come to a stop.
0:10:45|0:10:49|At that moment, they saw [Yang Tianfang] waiting in front of the door, ready to get off the car.
0:10:53|0:10:59|The crowd took the heavy luggage from [Yang Tianfang]'s hands.
0:10:59|0:11:2|At this moment, they discovered the woman traveling with [Yang Tianfang] was [Su Lin].
0:11:2|0:11:8|[Tan Qing] looked at Tang Xiaojuan and gave an awkward smile.
0:11:35|0:11:39|Friends helped [Yang Tianfang] carry his luggage, preparing to welcome him and clean up, and they arrived at the restaurant.
0:11:43|0:11:56|Long time no see, everyone ordered a table of dishes and sat around together.
0:11:56|0:12:0|The crowd raised their glasses and drank heartily.
0:12:40|0:12:44|Another round of drinks down, but the conversation at the table always seems to be hiding something.
0:13:10|0:13:21|Upon hearing this, [Yang Tianfang]'s face immediately changed.
0:13:21|0:13:24|The atmosphere instantly became awkward, with everyone looking at each other helplessly.
0:13:30|0:13:33|One night, [Tan Qing] just couldn't fall asleep.
0:13:33|0:13:39|Even after so many years have passed, he still finds himself thinking about all sorts of things that happened in the past at night.
0:13:39|0:13:45|Reluctantly, he could only sit up and endure this cold, lonely night.
0:13:45|0:13:58|Gradually, his thoughts drifted back to the time when [Yang Tianfang] had just left for another place, leaving [Tan Qing] alone and helpless in his hometown. And at this moment, his mother also passed away due to illness, plunging [Tan Qing] into immense sorrow.
0:13:58|0:14:3|He washed his face with tears all day long, barely getting by with the help of [Ding Shun].
0:14:20|0:14:32|[Tan Qing] watched as his father turned around and placed the portrait on the table. After wiping away his tears, he then turned to [Ding Shun] sitting behind him and said.
0:15:16|0:15:19|[Tan Qing] writes letters to [Yang Tianfang] whenever she has free time.
0:15:39|0:15:43|Even so, [Yang Tianfang] has never responded to [Tan Qing]'s yearning.
0:15:43|0:15:49|Perhaps due to busy work or perhaps because of long-distance separation, the relationship between [Tan Qing] and [Su Lin] gradually faded.
0:15:51|0:15:56|[Tan Qing] walked alone to the riverside for a stroll after the party dispersed.
0:15:56|0:16:1|On this quiet and chilly night, he lay on the bridge, gazing at the cold and calm river.
0:16:1|0:16:6|Faced with his feelings towards [Tan Qing], he is also filled with resentment and dissatisfaction.
0:16:7|0:16:16|After this reunion with an old friend, he recalled the past memories of happiness, and no one expected that this relationship would eventually develop into this.
0:16:16|0:16:24|In the dense forest outside the city, there is a thatched cottage where [Yang Tianfang]'s father often stays, as if isolated from the world.
0:16:24|0:16:31|As soon as the day broke, Tan Qing's father woke up. He quickly tidied up and grabbed a few necessary items before heading out the door.
0:16:32|0:16:37|Outside the door, there are many saplings piled up, which has been the persistent career of the father for many years.
0:16:37|0:16:45|Tan Qing bent down and lifted a small sapling, then walked towards the depths of the forest, leaving behind a frail yet determined figure.
0:16:45|0:16:49|After years of not returning home, [Yang Tianfang] is now planning to go into the woods to find his father.
0:16:50|0:16:57|The rugged mountain road and lush vegetation made it difficult for [Yang Tianfang] to walk, he had to stop and catch his breath after just a few steps.
0:17:1|0:17:4|After taking a break, he regained his energy and continued to move forward.
0:17:14|0:17:19|Not long after, [Yang Tianfang] found the thatched cottage where his father lived.
0:17:19|0:17:23|He lifted the door curtain and looked inside, but did not see his father's figure.
0:17:23|0:17:28|Confused, Tan Qing looked around and finally saw the busy figure on the mountainside.
0:17:28|0:17:33|Seeing this situation, [Yang Tianfang] smiled knowingly and quickly picked up the shovel next to him to follow.
0:17:34|0:17:39|Years of not seeing his father, the longing pushed him to run all the way.
0:17:44|0:17:49|After planting the sapling, the father looked up and saw his son walking towards him from a distance.
0:18:8|0:18:12|Tan Qing and Su Lin sat down in place and started discussing.
0:18:41|0:18:45|Upon hearing his father's words, [Yang Tianfang] immediately showed a look of difficulty.
0:19:12|0:19:18|Tan Qing's father didn't understand his feelings. Tan Qing could only sigh and look helplessly into the distance.
0:19:18|0:19:29|Upon returning home, [Yang Tianfang] was chopping wood in the yard.
0:19:29|0:19:32|[Yang Tianfang] took the gift and led the guests into the house.
0:20:32|0:20:34|[Tan Qing] and his friend are outside the house.
0:21:25|0:21:27|Tan Qing also joined the two of them.
0:23:27|0:23:29|Su Lin finds Juanhua after leaving.
0:23:48|0:23:51|Listen, [Su Lin] turned and walked away.
0:23:51|0:23:56|Although leaving, Tan Qing still turned back every three steps, prompting Juanhua to urge constantly.
0:23:56|0:24:0|The next day, [Yang Tianfang], [Su Lin], and Tang Xiaojuan went to the city together.
0:24:0|0:24:5|They walked on the street, chatting about some things in their respective lives.
0:24:10|0:24:13|Three of them stopped by a stone stele.
0:24:19|0:24:21|[Yang Tianfang] watched on the side in a trance.
0:24:23|0:24:25|[Ding Shun] pushes the door and returns home.
0:24:25|0:24:29|At this point, [Tan Qing] has already married [Ding Shun] and has a stepson.
0:25:27|0:25:35|After saying that, [Tan Qing] dragged her son away on her own.
0:25:35|0:25:38|The competition is taking place on the riverbank at this moment.
0:25:38|0:25:44|This lake is artificial, in front of the lake in winter and in the future is the testing ground for the chassis of the German Dr. Group's cars.
0:26:13|0:26:17|After hanging up the phone, [Yang Tianfang] and his group continued to stroll around the streets.
0:26:34|0:26:37|[Tan Qing] and [Su Lin] made the scene very awkward.
0:26:55|0:26:56|Upon hearing Tan Qing say this.
0:26:56|0:27:3|Tan Qing didn't know how to argue back, so she could only lower her head.
0:27:4|0:27:17|Tan Qing remained silent on this matter, the awkward atmosphere leaving everyone unsure of what to say.
0:27:17|0:27:20|This statement made the situation even more awkward.
0:27:20|0:27:32|At this moment, [Yang Tianfang]'s phone suddenly rang, and he answered it smoothly.
0:27:41|0:27:45|Su Lin chased after Yang Tianfang, leaving Tan Qing standing still in place.
0:27:45|0:27:48|After discussing, the remaining people all went to the tavern.
0:28:33|0:28:37|[Bat'er] ignored advice, and no one could do anything about it, so they had to let him be.
0:29:5|0:29:8|The group gathered in the office to discuss.
0:29:20|0:29:22|Tan Qing nodded repeatedly after listening.
0:29:41|0:29:43|[Tan Qing] and [Su Lin] exchanged a smile.
0:30:12|0:30:17|Back home, [Yang Tianfang] sits down to eat with his parents.
0:31:27|0:31:34|The father's words plunged [Yang Tianfang] into contemplation, unsure of how to respond to his father, he could only bow his head and continue eating.
0:31:34|0:31:36|The next day, he discussed with his friends.
0:32:21|0:32:24|Everyone is very satisfied with [Tan Qing].
0:33:11|0:33:16|[Bat'er] and his wife had a very unpleasant conversation, each with their own opinions about the opening.
0:33:16|0:33:19|At this moment, [Yang Tianfang] and [Tan Xiaojuan] are chatting on the bridge.
0:34:16|0:34:23|As they were talking, a person walked by on the bridge. They turned to look, and their eyes met with the person passing by.
0:34:24|0:34:27|[Tan Qing]'s face darkened instantly.
0:34:32|0:34:33|Tan Qing sighed.
0:34:40|0:34:47|[Tan Qing] still looked furious about this.
0:34:50|0:34:59|In the evening, [Ding Shun] returned home reeking of alcohol.
0:35:6|0:35:11|Seeing her husband passed out drunk again, [Tan Qing] helplessly sat up from the bed.
0:35:11|0:35:16|She seemed to have thrown countless tantrums over this, gradually losing her energy.
0:35:16|0:35:23|After sighing, Tan Qing got out of bed and walked into the kitchen, poured a glass of water in front of her drunken husband Su Lin.
0:35:34|0:35:40|[Tan Qing] now only thought he was drunk, with no intention to argue, gave him a disdainful look and turned his head away.
0:35:40|0:35:44|[Ding Shun] put down the cup and lay down again after drinking the water.
0:36:14|0:36:17|[Ding Shun] was not convinced and went to sleep.
0:36:17|0:36:21|Seeing her husband finally quiet down, [Tan Qing] also turned around and went to sleep.
0:36:21|0:36:23|The next day, [Yang Tianfang] and his friends discussed together.
0:36:30|0:36:33|[Batuer] put a lot of effort into the project.
0:37:4|0:37:8|[Su Lin] went there, closed his mouth, and turned around.
0:38:24|0:38:29|After implementing the plan for a period of time, [Tan Qing] and [Su Lin] have achieved some success.
0:38:56|0:39:1|[Su Lin] got up and left, meanwhile, in a restaurant, [Ding Shun] was having dinner with a group of friends.
0:39:10|0:39:14|The crowd raised their glasses, clinked them together, and then all drank up.
0:40:29|0:40:31|After a moment of contemplation, [Tan Qing] said to her friend.
0:41:2|0:41:5|Hearing his friend's declaration, [Tan Qing] appeared very happy.
0:41:5|0:41:8|[Tan Qing] took the phone after listening to Guiyuan's introduction.
0:41:24|0:41:31|On the other side, [Su Lin] had an accident while working at the construction site.
0:41:31|0:41:47|Tan Qing and Su Lin immediately set off for the scene upon hearing the news.
0:41:47|0:41:49|Assistant Zhang, leading the way, pushed [Su Lin] aside.
0:41:53|0:41:55|Assistant Zhang did not give [Su Lin] a good look.
0:41:55|0:41:57|He pondered with a look of confusion on his face.
0:42:32|0:42:37|The incident happened suddenly, and upon hearing the news, [Batel] immediately thought of going to find the mayor for inquiries.
0:42:37|0:42:49|The project, which was progressing smoothly, took a wrong turn, causing panic for Tan Qing and Su Lin. The excavator mercilessly destroyed the newly built factory building, leaving countless bricks, tiles, and rubble piled up like small mountains on the ground, undoing days of hard work in an instant.
0:42:49|0:42:51|[Batuer] knocked on the mayor's door, but there was no response.
0:43:2|0:43:6|Seeking help from the mayor, Tan Qing, Batel could only temporarily return to his own home.
0:43:6|0:43:11|That day, [Batel] was sorting out documents at home when someone rang the doorbell.
0:43:13|0:43:16|He put down the documents in his hand and got up to open the door.
0:43:16|0:43:18|Outside the door is a familiar face.
0:44:37|0:44:41|After Tan Qing left, Batel's wife started talking again.
0:45:3|0:45:19|In another office, Assistant Zhang put down his work with a helpless look on his face and took the application. He glanced through it disinterestedly and then said to [Su Lin] standing beside him. [Su Lin] looked puzzled.
0:45:48|0:45:52|Assistant Zhang rejected the application, leaving [Su Lin] no choice but to turn around and leave in resignation.
0:45:52|0:46:14|[Ba Te Er] hung up the phone in the office, and his wife, [Si Qin], walked over.
0:46:44|0:46:53|Siqing smoothed her hair and left the office. At this time, [Yang Tianfang] also returned from out of town.
0:48:7|0:48:10|[Batuer] listened and took out the previous phone from behind.
0:48:10|0:48:12|[Tan Qing] couldn't help but smile broadly.
0:48:12|0:48:15|Su Lin winked.
0:48:15|0:48:17|Tan Qing and Su Lin exchanged a smile.
0:48:36|0:48:43|[Yang Tianfang]'s face changed, hearing this name, he immediately put his phone back in his pocket.
0:49:15|0:49:24|[Yang Tianfang] was furious upon hearing the news, but his hostility towards [Tan Qing] also lessened a bit. The conflict between the two will be easier to resolve once it is brought out into the open.
0:49:24|0:49:29|On a beautiful riverbank, [Ding Shun] is camping with a few of his good friends.
0:49:29|0:49:34|He stood up, took off his coat, and put on waterproof clothing, preparing to catch fish in the river.
0:49:34|0:49:44|He picked up the pre-prepared fishing net, spread it flat on the surface of the river and waited quietly. At this moment, Assistant Zhang standing on the bank shouted to him.
0:49:55|0:49:59|[Ding Shun] was not impressed by this, chuckled and went back to work, while Assistant Zhang invited everyone to have some fish.
0:50:10|0:50:11|Assistant Zhang was not concerned about this.
0:50:11|0:50:13|[Yang Tianfang] is currently hanging out with friends.
0:50:50|0:50:52|[Tan Qing] sighed helplessly.
0:51:2|0:51:6|[Su Lin] and [Battar] have to keep this lesson in mind after this setback.
0:51:6|0:51:11|The next day, [Yang Tianfang] was reading at home when [Tan Qing] suddenly came to visit.
0:51:11|0:51:14|[Tan Qing] hesitated for a moment before speaking.
0:51:14|0:51:18|[Tan Qing] heard the voice and was first stunned, then slowly turned around.
0:51:18|0:51:19|He looked at [Tan Qing] and said.
0:51:23|0:51:27|[Yang Tianfang] at this moment also softened his attitude towards [Tan Qing].
0:51:27|0:51:30|He stood up with his back to [Tan Qing].
0:51:31|0:51:37|Hearing [Tan Qing] following behind, she could only turn around and sit on the bed, still deliberately avoiding [Tan Qing]'s gaze.
0:51:43|0:51:46|She took a deep breath and continued speaking.
0:51:49|0:51:54|[Yang Tianfang] heard the news and turned to look at [Tan Qing].
0:51:59|0:52:6|When it comes to the favor you showed me back then, Tan Qing slowly stood up.
0:52:6|0:52:8|Upon hearing this, [Tan Qing] blinked back tears.
0:52:31|0:52:35|At this moment, [Tan Qing] was in tears and unable to speak.
0:52:35|0:52:37|[Yang Tianfang] continued.
0:52:54|0:53:2|At this moment, Tang Xiaojuan also walked in, and [Tan Qing] could no longer hold back, starting to cry uncontrollably.
0:53:2|0:53:7|Unable to keep Tan Qing from running away, Tang Xiaojuan could only turn around and start comforting Su Lin.
0:53:7|0:53:14|[Yang Tianfang] looked up, trying hard to suppress his emotions. When he heard Tang Xiaojuan approaching, he turned his head and bent down to sit on the sofa.
0:53:17|0:53:24|[Yang Tianfang] still turned his back without saying a word. After Tang Xiaojuan's persuasion, [Yang Tianfang] seemed to have some relief.
0:53:24|0:53:25|The next day, he went to see Mayor Zhu for inquiries.
0:53:50|0:53:53|Tan Qing and Su Lin are sitting on the sofa.
0:54:22|0:54:31|After a conversation with the mayor, [Yang Tianfang] gained more confidence. [Bartel] and Tang Xiaojuan were discussing with [Yang Tianfang] in the restaurant when [Bartel]'s phone rang.
0:54:34|0:54:38|Siqin is very worried about [Bartle].
0:54:38|0:54:41|The couple increasingly distrust each other, and their conflicts are becoming more apparent.
0:54:41|0:54:48|[Batuer] puts down the phone.
0:54:48|0:54:52|[Bat'er] knows in his heart that [Tan Qing] makes sense.
0:55:18|0:55:25|[Yang Tianfang] turned to chase Xiao Juan, while [Bartel] turned and walked away.
0:55:25|0:55:34|[Bat'er] and [Siqin] often behave like this as a couple, temporarily setting aside their conflicts. With the permission of Mayor Zhu, the beverage factory project is progressing rapidly.
0:55:34|0:55:37|The division of labor among the group was clear, and the efficiency was considerable.
0:55:37|0:55:43|[Bat'er] and [Su Lin] are supervising the construction site, while [Yang Tianfang] is busy running around to make connections, paving the way for the opening of the beverage factory.
0:55:43|0:55:49|After coming out of the office, [Yang Tianfang] breathed a sigh of relief, as if everything was getting better.
0:55:49|0:55:55|In a hospital, [Tan Qing] is taking care of her sick son, while Tang Xiaojuan also comes to visit.
0:56:35|0:56:39|[Tan Qing] couldn't believe it for a moment.
0:56:45|0:56:49|It turns out that Tan Qing has been misunderstanding the relationship between Tang Xiaojuan and [Yang Tianfang].
0:56:49|0:56:55|One night, [Yang Tianfang] received a phone call from [Tan Qing] while resting in the hotel.
0:57:15|0:57:18|Tan Qing and Su Lin met up for a date.
0:57:26|0:57:29|The two have now resolved their past grievances.
0:58:9|0:58:13|Faced with Tan Qing's kindness, Yang Tianfang hesitated for a moment, not knowing what to say.
0:58:23|0:58:35|[Tan Qing] sincerely wanted to help [Yang Tianfang], but he also acted within his means. He did not deplete his savings for this, avoiding putting himself in financial distress.
0:58:35|0:58:40|Later, [Tan Qing] often took her son to the science museum to watch performances, and their lives were not affected by it.
0:58:41|0:58:48|When the three of them were discussing engineering matters, Tan Qing always called in, but Su Lin hung up every time and ignored her.
0:58:48|0:58:59|Although [Yang Tianfang] noticed something was amiss, he felt awkward about getting involved in his friend's family matters, so he pretended nothing had happened and continued discussing the matter at hand.
0:58:59|0:59:3|[Su Lin] and [Battelle] walked into [Yang Tianfang]'s office and the three of them gathered to discuss.
1:0:22|1:0:29|Su Lin gestured in agreement, while Tan Qing sat in the office with a worried expression on her face, staring at the computer screen.
1:0:46|1:1:2|In this beverage factory project, he was also busy and worked hard, not only did he put in a lot of effort, but he also had to balance his work on the other side. The pressure from both sides made him anxious. In terms of the company, he also tried his best to make connections and pave the way, in order to secure more investments for [Yang Tianfang]'s beverage factory.
1:1:3|1:1:11|Nevertheless, [Bartle]'s wife, Siqin, always keeps a close eye on me, misunderstanding the relationship between me and [Bartle], causing me to lose face in front of my friends.
1:1:11|1:1:19|Various things like this have been weighing on Tan Qing, leaving her breathless and frowning all day long. She can only try to digest it all on her own.
1:1:19|1:1:23|And at this moment in the home of [Tan Qing], [Ding Shun] is in the yard drying fishing nets.
1:1:25|1:1:30|Upon hearing this, [Tan Qing] walked out of the kitchen with a basin and questioned [Ding Shun].
1:1:45|1:1:47|[Ding Shun] is talking while busy.
1:1:54|1:1:59|[Tan Qing] handed the fishing line to him, and [Ding Shun] picked it up.
1:1:59|1:2:0|At the train station.
1:2:53|1:3:0|On the side, [Su Lin] took out a gift from the bag, a wooden carving.
1:3:0|1:3:8|The train started moving, Tang Xiaojuan returned to the company, with [Yang Tianfang] accompanying the mayor to visit the site.
1:3:19|1:3:24|At the same time, on a river bank, [Ding Shun] is running frantically to shore, desperate to use the restroom.
1:3:24|1:3:25|Assistant Zhang said at this moment.
1:3:51|1:3:57|[Ding Shun], after changing clothes, hurriedly took out a tissue from his bag and clenched it in his hand, then turned and ran towards the distant woods.
1:4:3|1:4:10|The people barbecuing watched as [Ding Shun] walked away, planning to take a break and play cards before continuing to prepare when [Ding Shun] returned.
1:4:10|1:4:17|At this moment, in a panic, [Ding Shun] ran into the woods and found a secluded spot to crouch down.
1:4:17|1:4:20|Little did he know, danger lurked in this old forest.
1:4:20|1:4:28|While Tan Qing was relieving himself in peace, he suddenly heard something unusual behind him. With a look of terror on his face, he saw a huge and terrifying bear rushing out from behind.
1:4:28|1:4:30|After this round, [Tan Qing] was killed and [Su Lin] was injured.
1:4:34|1:4:37|[Yang Tianfang] welcomes Siqin and [Bartle] in the office.
1:4:39|1:4:43|After Siqin sat down, [Tan Qing] looked around and spoke.
1:4:47|1:4:49|Siqin listens to her father, glaring at [Bartle].
1:5:32|1:5:37|Since receiving the gold chain and implementing the Tianbao Project, there have been more wild animals.
1:5:58|1:6:0|In the hospital, [Ding Shun] is lying on the bed.
1:6:5|1:6:8|Yang Tianfang and his group came to visit Ding Shun.
1:6:25|1:6:28|[Yang Tianfang] handed the money to [Tan Qing].
1:6:28|1:6:31|Tan Qing could not refuse too much about this, so she could only accept it.
1:6:34|1:6:39|At the old farm, [Yang Tianfang] and a group of friends who grew up together gathered together.
1:7:4|1:7:8|Juanhua smiled and looked up at Siqin, everyone was very happy about it.
1:7:8|1:7:11|[Tan Qing] and Su Lin are discussing the establishment of a factory in their hometown.
1:7:21|1:7:28|Siqin took out a passbook from her pocket.
1:7:28|1:7:32|[Batuer] took it from Siqin and handed it to [Yang Tianfang].
1:7:32|1:7:35|Faced with such a generous gift, [Yang Tianfang] could only express his thanks repeatedly.
1:8:7|1:8:10|In the office, [Yang Tianfang] received a phone call.
1:8:10|1:8:11|The answer was received over the phone.
1:8:22|1:8:30|After hanging up the phone, [Yang Tianfang] began to busy himself and later went to visit [Ding Shun].
1:8:30|1:8:40|Putting down the gift in his hand, [Yang Tianfang] looked at [Ding Shun] lying on the hospital bed with a worried expression.
1:8:40|1:8:49|[Tan Qing] arranged for [Yang Tianfang] and [Su Lin] to sit by the bed, looking at [Ding Shun] who had no reaction and couldn't move, sighed and said slowly.
1:8:49|1:8:54|[Ding Shun] struggled to open his eyes, for Niu Niu, and also for [Tan Qing].
1:9:3|1:9:8|Seeing the former enemy putting in so much effort to help, [Ding Shun] was deeply moved.
1:9:8|1:9:11|He slowly reached out his hand, and [Tan Qing] also held it with both hands.
1:9:11|1:9:17|At this moment, all the conflicts between the two have been completely resolved, leaving only mutual respect.
1:9:21|1:9:33|[Ding Shun] heard what [Yang Tianfang] said, tears welled up in his eyes. At the same time, he felt ashamed for his previous misdeeds towards [Yang Tianfang]. [Tan Qing] was also moved by the scene, standing aside trying hard to hold back tears.
1:9:33|1:9:45|Although [Yang Tianfang] used to dislike [Ding Shun] a lot, that's all in the past now. The conflicts between different parties have been resolved, and everything is getting better. Siqin has also started working at the beverage factory to ensure the quality of the products.
1:9:46|1:9:51|Although the beverage factory appears to be thriving on the surface, there are actually hidden undercurrents.
1:9:51|1:9:53|Not long after, the police came knocking on the door.
1:9:53|1:9:54|The police officer takes out a drink.
1:10:15|1:10:19|[Yang Tianfang] witnessed, and quickly pushed aside the excited [Su Lin].
1:10:41|1:10:53|After seeing off [Su Lin], [Yang Tianfang] continued to discuss with the police.
1:10:53|1:11:0|In the end, there was no way to resist. The huge wind on the door also sealed the enthusiasm of everyone's entrepreneurship.
1:11:9|1:11:14|Batel said to [Su Lin].
1:11:14|1:11:19|There's no use being anxious, the three of them fell into silence at this moment.
1:12:3|1:12:9|Everyone stood up and raised their glasses, then drank up in one gulp.
1:12:9|1:12:16|After some pleasantries, everyone took their seats. However, at this moment, [Ding Shun] filled his cup with wine, stood up and spoke.
1:12:16|1:12:22|He should now be as carefree as he used to be, even a little shy.
1:12:22|1:12:24|After a moment of contemplation, he spoke with a look of resignation on his face.
1:12:57|1:13:14|Hearing this, [Yang Tianfang] sitting next to them also stood up, wanting to express his gratitude in a thousand words.
1:13:14|1:13:18|The banquet ended, and soon came the day of reckoning for the gang.
1:14:56|1:15:4|The beverage factory opened smoothly amidst cheers from the crowd, with Tan Qing and Su Lin leasing and donating beverages for external sales.
1:15:4|1:15:6|During the sales journey, they received valuable information.
1:15:21|1:15:28|Receiving a disdainful look from Juanhua, [Su Lin] could only shut up and the two of them then started the car, leaving the mountain where drinks were being sold.
1:15:28|1:15:33|The sales at the beverage factory have unexpectedly been doing well during this period, with many large orders.
1:15:33|1:15:37|[Su Lin] sat in the office at any time, smiling as she contacted the merchants.
1:16:3|1:16:7|Just finished dealing with the order, and his own phone rang again.
1:16:7|1:16:10|Upon receiving the incoming call, [Tan Qing] answered the phone.
1:16:21|1:16:28|After hanging up the phone, he stretched lazily to loosen his stiff limbs, and then plunged back into his intense work.
1:16:28|1:16:32|In the factory at this moment, the drinks are neatly arranged in bottles on the assembly line.
1:16:59|1:17:3|After introducing each other, everyone took their seats, and [Yang Tianfang] stood up to give a speech.
1:17:27|1:17:31|Amidst the enthusiastic applause, [Tan Qing] stood up and solemnly spoke.
1:17:31|1:17:37|At this point, [Tan Qing] reached out and picked up the drink on the table, continuing to speak.
1:17:37|1:17:40|Upon hearing this, everyone's faces lit up with joy.
1:18:3|1:18:6|Upon receiving the news, the whole audience erupted into thunderous applause.
1:18:6|1:18:10|After Zhang Guang took his seat, [Yang Tianfang] took over the conversation and continued speaking.
1:18:25|1:18:31|Zhang Guang also stood up at this moment, clinked glasses with [Yang Tianfang], and nodded in agreement.
1:18:31|1:18:36|Another round of toasts, and the atmosphere at the dining table is gradually heating up.
1:18:36|1:18:40|After sitting down, Zhang Guang picked up the wine on the table and said to everyone.
1:19:41|1:19:46|The crowd raised their glasses again, thanking Zhang Guang for his support of the beverage factory.
1:19:46|1:19:50|After dinner, [Yang Tianfang] and his group took Zhang Guang to visit the production line of the beverage factory.
1:19:50|1:19:59|Tan Qing provided detailed explanations on the current production efficiency and hygiene conditions, which Zhang Guang expressed satisfaction with during the visit, nodding frequently.
1:19:59|1:20:4|After this visit, [Zhang Guang] is completely reassured about the attractions at Lhama Mountain.
1:20:4|1:20:10|After the visit, the group went to Lama Mountain, where [Yang Tianfang] grew up.
1:20:10|1:20:16|He explored the stunning natural scenery here with [Tan Qing], and also experienced the unique ecological environment of the Lamasery Mountain together with [Su Lin].
1:20:21|1:20:26|They continued on their journey, enjoying the scenery along the way while listening to [Yang Tianfang]'s explanations.
1:20:26|1:20:32|Time passed quickly, and the group unknowingly arrived at the foot of the main peak of Lama Mountain.
1:20:32|1:20:36|At this moment, [Yang Tianfang] stopped in his tracks and turned to [Zhang Guang] behind him.
1:20:48|1:20:51|[Zhang Guang] nodded and continued to climb up.
1:21:2|1:21:7|The towering peaks rose into the clouds, with a unique shape.
1:21:7|1:21:12|The group continued to move forward and soon arrived at a large forest halfway up the mountain.
1:21:19|1:21:27|The group bent down, passed through a narrow passage, reached the mountaintop, and what awaited them was a breathtaking view of all the surrounding mountains.
1:21:27|1:21:36|[Yang Tianfang]'s creative journey is like this long and arduous mountain road. Although the path ahead is full of difficulties and obstacles, after enduring hardships, one will eventually reach the mountaintop.
