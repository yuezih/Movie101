0:1:49|0:1:54|[Zhu Guangsheng] looked at the grilled meat in his hand, then placed the skewer on the plate.
0:2:39|0:2:45|Dejected, [Zhu Guangsheng] placed his clenched fist on the table and immediately stood up.
0:2:52|0:3:1|The other two at the table watched as Zhu Guangsheng's eyes followed the man, and just as Zhu Guangsheng was about to leave, he was stopped.
0:3:31|0:3:57|The fat man shook off [Zhu Guangsheng]'s hand. [Zhu Guangsheng] shouted at their backs, at a loss for words. He looked at the little dog in his arms with a heart full of pity. The just rescued little dog had a pair of big watery eyes, looking innocent. Then he nodded and continued to say, then he walked home with the little dog. But not long after, he put the little dog on the side of the road.
0:3:57|0:4:1|He felt very pleased watching the lively little dog in front of him.
0:4:4|0:4:31|The clueless puppy sat still watching him swing the scarf around his neck. Then he made a dramatic gesture towards the puppy, took a few small steps forward, and [Zhu Guangsheng]'s figure gradually moved away. The puppy stood up and walked towards him. The screen gradually turned black, and the title "Blood Wolfhound" emerged in the middle, accompanied by the mournful howls of two evil wolves.
0:5:4|0:5:25|The highly vigilant snow wolf looked back at everything around it, the sky full of white clouds flowing rapidly in its eyes. Suddenly, under the snow-covered ground, a pair of eyes covered in frost slowly opened under a black hat. He stared closely at the snow wolf not far away, and finally the snow on the branches fell down, and the flat ground sank.
0:5:25|0:5:30|The snow wolf, Zhu Guangsheng, heard the movement and let out a low growl, but the hunting rifle in the dark had already aimed at him.
0:5:31|0:5:37|The long-planned gunshot finally rang out, and at this moment the Snow Wolf also fell in a pool of blood. On the other side
0:5:37|0:5:44|Forest ranger [Zhu Guangsheng], who heard the sound, is rushing towards the deep mountains on horseback, followed closely by hunting dogs to help him find the way.
0:5:44|0:6:3|At the same time, a group of people emerged from the snow, ignoring the snow on their bodies, their eyes fixed on the fallen snow wolf not far away. [Zhang Biao], holding a hunting rifle with a forest ranger badge on his arm, and another person took out a woven bag they carried with them and approached the snow wolf, then put it into the bag.
0:6:3|0:6:13|Zhu Guangsheng then arrived at the forest police station in Sardabande Canyon. Sitting on a horse, he pulled down the scarf covering his mouth, looked around, as if searching for something.
0:6:14|0:6:35|In the deep mountains, hunters carrying snow wolf woven bags walked towards the forest, unaware that three snow wolves standing on the mountainside were staring at them fiercely. Soon they arrived at the snow wolf's den, and upon seeing the wolf cubs, the lead man immediately caught one out. The captured wolf cub looked at the hunters and kept making a mournful and plaintive cry.
0:6:39|0:6:49|The injured wolf cub caught by the hunter was thrown towards the tree trunk and fell to the ground, and he pulled out another wolf cub from the hole. At this moment, a hunting gun was aimed at the two of them, and [Zhang Biao] holding the gun said,
0:7:20|0:7:29|The impatient [Director Liu] became cautious instantly after hearing [Zhu Guangsheng]'s words. Subsequently, [Director Liu] quickly gathered the police officers to head to the Wild Wolf Valley. Due to his exceptional familiarity with the terrain,
0:7:35|0:7:53|The four fleeing individuals ran in different directions, as the arriving police officers got out of the car and raised their guns to chase after them. [Zhu Guangsheng], who got out of the car later, called his beloved dog to join the pursuit. The thick snow on the ground hindered the police officers' chase, but they fearlessly followed the footprints left by the hunters.
0:7:55|0:8:5|At that moment, [Zhu Guangsheng]'s beloved dog Mengzi came to the rescue. Brave and fierce, it swiftly pounced on [Zhang Biao], biting onto his arm. No matter how hard [Zhang Biao] tried to shake it off, he couldn't escape its jaws.
0:8:5|0:8:8|Director Liu then forcefully pulled off Zhang Biao's mask,
0:8:13|0:8:33|The police pushed the handcuffed [Zhang Biao], who suddenly looked up at [Zhu Guangsheng] standing beside him with resentment in his eyes. The simple-minded [Zhu Guangsheng] frowned and stared back at him. Then, the Director Liu behind them pushed and urged him to move on quickly. However, after taking a few steps, he turned back and warned [Zhu Guangsheng] with his eyes. At that moment, the kind-hearted [Zhu Guangsheng] finally realized and started to worry.
0:8:33|0:8:45|In the dim sky, large snowflakes fell one after another, as if hiding the massacre in the white snow. The snow wolf that escaped quietly kept all of this in mind.
0:8:45|0:8:55|The next day, the sun shone down on the earth. In the forest ranger station of Sardaband Canyon, sheep were gathered in piles, standing on the mountainside that had not yet melted, bleating.
0:8:55|0:8:58|Accompanied by the frantic barking of the dogs locked in the dog pound.
0:8:58|0:9:4|Later, [Lao Zhou] carried a shoulder pole and walked towards the dog field, while [Mengzi] excitedly ran ahead.
0:9:6|0:9:15|Patiently, [Zhu Guangsheng] opened the cages one by one to feed the wolves, and the wolves, attracted by the food, immediately stopped barking. Then, [Zhu Guangsheng] took [Mengzi] to the training ground.
0:9:18|0:9:23|Mengzi leaped up, swiftly passed through the obstacle equipment, and the car on the mountain road broadcasted a sound.
0:9:35|0:9:57|[Zhu Guangsheng] was driving and talking on the phone. He tried hard to see the road ahead clearly and firmly replied. With only his car on the mountain road at this moment, he quickly stepped on the brake, turned the car around, and urgently headed home with the hazard lights on. He drove the car swiftly through the pitch-black road and soon appeared at the dog kennel. Holding a flashlight, he walked towards the innermost part.
0:9:57|0:10:3|In sight are a mother dog and several puppies lying in a doghouse,
0:10:9|0:10:21|After expressing his love for dogs, [Zhu Guangsheng] took off his coat and covered the mother dog, who had just given birth, as she continued to lick the puppies to clean them.
0:10:21|0:10:37|Returning home, [Zhu Guangsheng] first put on a military coat with a forest ranger badge. Then he looked at the stacked blankets on the bedside, glanced at the table beside, and finally placed the pillow aside, picked up the blanket with one arm. Suddenly, he noticed a jar on the cabinet.
0:10:37|0:10:46|He picked up the can and carefully read the instructions, then put it down. After a few steps, he turned back, picked up the can, and walked outside.
0:10:47|0:11:8|Not long after, [Zhu Guangsheng]'s wife returned to the house in the snowstorm. Standing at the door, she stomped to get rid of the blood seeping into her shoes. While brushing off the snow on her body, she looked inside the house. Then she walked towards the messy dining table holding two cabbages. She first put down her shoulder bag, then placed the cabbages on the table. Still not fully recovered, she rubbed her hands together while looking around.
0:11:8|0:11:19|In the dog kennel, the mother dog finally gave birth to the last puppy with the help of [Zhu Guangsheng]. It immediately bit through the puppy's amniotic sac and helped clean the puppy, while [Zhu Guangsheng] held onto its tail.
0:11:20|0:11:46|After saying goodbye to his old friend, [Zhu Guangsheng] turned and walked away, leaving only him leaning on the fence, quietly watching the mother dog and her puppies. At this moment, he felt extremely happy inside. The mother dog then picked up the puppies that were placed on [Zhu Guangsheng]'s back, one by one, and started nursing them. [Zhu Guangsheng] picked up the last puppy born and placed it next to the mother dog, allowing her to continue cleaning the puppies. Contentedly, [Zhu Guangsheng] sat in the dog's nest and unconsciously started humming a song.
0:11:46|0:11:52|He lovingly stroked the mother dog's head, unable to express his feelings at the moment with words.
0:11:52|0:12:3|The old buddy looked at the recovering mother dog and smiled at [Zhu Guangsheng]. Then he handed over the prepared milk powder, and [Zhu Guangsheng] carefully took the basin and placed it in front of the mother dog for her to drink freely.
0:12:4|0:12:23|Later, when [Zhu Guangsheng] returned home, he saw his wife, who was picking dates, suddenly become cautious. He turned around, walked to the mirror, took off his hat, shook off the snow on his body, then bent down to wash his hands. After drying them, he walked to the stove, picked up the lid and looked inside. Not finding any food, he opened another lid beside it.
0:12:23|0:12:42|To his surprise, there was still no food in the pot. He looked at his wife sitting next to him in amazement, then took out a small knife he carried with him and cut down the cured meat hanging in the corner. Sitting in front of the cutting board, he put away the knife and ate the meat heartily. After gnawing on a piece of meat, [Zhu Guangsheng] nervously shifted his feet.
0:12:43|0:12:49|The two of them stood back to back, talking. [Zhu Guangsheng] forced himself to remain calm and turned his head to say,
0:12:50|0:13:8|Zhu Guangsheng's wife, who was turning the big red date, pursed her lips, suppressing the anger in her heart. Zhu Guangsheng, chewing on the meat, began to look uneasy. He chewed on the meat, staring blankly at the remaining meat in his hand. Seeing him not responding for a long time, his wife, lost in thought, he realized at this moment that he had made a mistake.
0:13:12|0:13:18|His wife, [Zhu Cong], still received no response. She gradually clenched the hand placed in the dustpan in anger.
0:13:22|0:13:35|The wife threw the dustpan along with the jujubes at him, and he dropped the meat and picked up his hat to leave. When [Zhu Guangsheng] walked out of the door, the wife picked up the dustpan from the ground and threw it heavily at his back again.
0:13:56|0:14:16|Zhu Guangsheng and Zhang Biao sat on either side of the bed, panting heavily. After the eldest daughter finished speaking and left, the helpless younger daughter picked up the knife at the end of the bed and also walked out. At that moment, a frame appeared in the scene, containing two family photos and pictures of the young couple. They used to be so green, but the past time will never return.
0:14:16|0:14:28|The next day at the bustling market, the second daughter [Zhu Lin] stood at the cotton candy stall, waiting for her own cotton candy. After she finished eating the cotton candy to her satisfaction, she went to the stall selling bags and asked the boss to pack it for her.
0:14:28|0:14:54|Shortly after, she walked alone towards the market in the scene, and soon appeared next to the pile of dirt, where she was tidying up her clothes. A small dog squatting nearby lifted its innocent head to look at [Zhu Lin]. It softly whimpered when it saw [Zhu Lin] walking away and followed closely behind. [Zhu Lin] immediately stopped to prevent it from following, but after a few steps, it caught up again. After repeating this a few times, it finally lay on the ground, exposing its belly, and acted coquettishly towards [Zhu Lin].
0:15:2|0:15:10|[Zhu Lin] walked to [Zhu Cong]'s side, leaning against her, and they both turned to look.
0:15:28|0:15:35|Reluctant Changzi, after putting down his hand that was caressing his head, took a satisfying bite of the skewer and returned to the room where Zhu Cong was practicing dance moves.
0:15:54|0:16:19|[Zhu Cong] turned around and leaned on the bed railing, delivering a kick from behind. When her eyes glanced at [Zhu Lin]'s school bag, the guilty [Zhu Lin] immediately hugged the bag to his chest. Curious, [Zhu Cong] walked up and opened [Zhu Lin]'s bag, revealing a little dog poking its head out and looking around. Meanwhile, [Zhu Guangsheng] with a sickle in hand herded the sheep into the pen, then slowly walked down the hill and placed the sickle in front of the house.
0:16:19|0:16:49|[Zhu Lin], who was leaning against the wall, turned around holding a small dog when he heard a noise. [Zhu Guangsheng] smiled and glanced at [Zhu Lin], then turned to look at the sickle. After realizing what was happening, he immediately turned to look at the small dog in [Zhu Lin]'s arms. He couldn't help but walk over, pointing at the dog and asking [Zhu Lin]. Excitedly, [Zhu Guangsheng] stared at the dog, continuously petting its head. After speaking, he stood up straight and looked in the direction behind him.
0:16:50|0:16:52|He then turned to [Zhu Lin] and said,
0:16:54|0:17:4|He leaned close to [Zhu Lin]'s ear and whispered softly. The two like-minded individuals exchanged smiles, then [Zhu Guangsheng] turned and left, leaving [Zhu Lin] alone playing with the puppy.
0:17:16|0:17:31|Following the mother turning around and opening the door, reluctant [Zhu Lin] slowly walked towards the door and followed the mother out. With one foot propped on the bed railing doing a split, [Zhu Cong] smiled triumphantly, while the innocent little dog was placed on a pile of snow-covered weeds.
0:17:31|0:17:39|The next morning, as soon as it was light, [Zhu Lin] opened the door to look for the little dog. Just as he was feeling disappointed, the dog came walking along the wall corner.
0:17:46|0:18:3|She excitedly held the puppy tightly in her arms. At noon, under the bright sunshine, Old Zhu stood in front of the adobe oven, scooping the freshly baked bread into a basin with a shovel. His wife sat in the garden washing clothes. Suddenly, the sound of a tractor caught his wife's attention. She saw a man getting off the tractor.
0:18:18|0:18:24|The man stood on one foot on the adobe kiln, then squatted down beside it.
0:19:19|0:19:28|Old Zhu looked at [Zhu Lin] with affection on his face, his wife hung up the clothes and walked towards them, glaring at Old Zhu with her eyes, then she picked up the basin filled with bread and left.
0:19:32|0:19:37|The man turned and left tactfully, while Old Zhu caressed the little dog in his daughter's arms and said,
0:19:58|0:20:16|On the hillside, a man holding a bow and arrow, Zhu Guangsheng put down the shovel in his hand and walked towards him. Zhu Guangsheng reached out and took the bow and arrow. The man stepped back behind him and said, placing the sword on the string, adjusting his stance by pinching the end of the sword with two fingers, pulling back with force, only to see the arrow hitting the wooden stake in front accurately.
0:20:18|0:20:42|After handing the bow to the man, he looked at the stake he shot with a surprised expression. [Zhu Lin], holding a puppy, admired his father and then, in the training ground formed by the wooden stakes, Old Zhu was directing the apprentices. Sitting on the side holding the puppy, [Zhu Lin] watched them with pursed lips. After Old Zhu finished training, he guided the young puppy to walk on the arch-shaped equipment.
0:20:58|0:21:5|Time flies, Blue Wave has grown into a well-trained wolf dog, with strong and powerful limbs, running as fast as lightning.
0:21:5|0:21:13|After receiving instructions from Zhu Guangsheng, [it] quickly passed through the arched bridge and then swiftly climbed up the obstacle ladder.
0:21:13|0:21:26|Zhu Guangsheng then bent down at the finish line, arms outstretched, as Zhang Biao leaped over his back. After seeing Zhang Biao land smoothly, Zhu Guangsheng twirled his mop handle in a dramatic gesture and playfully frolicked with Zhang Biao.
0:21:30|0:21:48|The soaring [Blue Wave] grabbed [Zhu Guangsheng]'s hat and walked towards home, while [Zhu Lin] who was standing aside, bounced over to [Zhu Guangsheng] and linked arms with him, walking behind [Blue Wave]. A year later, as a forest ranger, [Zhu Guangsheng] walked in the snow leading a horse to search for mountains.
0:21:54|0:22:4|He was unaware that a snow wolf hidden deep in the forest was staring at him intently, with [Lan Bo] running ahead as if sensing something, heading towards the depths of the forest.
0:22:4|0:22:30|[Zhu Guangsheng] tied the horse to a tree, but suddenly heard the sound of an electric drill. At that moment, he became alert and discovered footprints extending into the depths of the forest in the snow. He glanced at [Zhang Biao] beside him and then gave an order. The well-trained [Zhang Biao] instinctively rushed out, with [Zhu Guangsheng] following closely behind. Nearby, the snow wolf licked its tongue as if waiting for a meal.
0:22:32|0:22:43|Zhu Guangsheng, who didn't pay attention to his footing, fell to the ground. Seeing the villain trying to escape, he quickly got up and chased after him. The brave Zhang Biao closely followed, seizing the opportunity to bite the villain's arm.
0:22:43|0:22:55|and dragged him on the ground. At this moment, the villain kept rolling, trying to break free from the bites of [Blue Wave], but [Blue Wave] didn't give him a chance to catch his breath, biting him tightly. The next day, in a great mood, [Zhu Guangsheng] hummed a tune.
0:22:55|0:23:4|As the eight large characters "Protecting the mountains and nurturing the forests, greening the motherland" on the side of the house were being repainted, at that moment, the police car stopped by the road, and Director Liu got out of the car and shouted at his back, [Director Liu].
0:23:17|0:23:22|[Zhu Guangsheng]'s movements began to slow down.
0:23:30|0:23:34|[Zhu Guangsheng] stopped his actions and turned to look at [Director Liu],
0:23:51|0:24:0|Director Liu started the car and drove away, watching Zhu Guangsheng go far away. At this moment, Zhu Guangsheng furrowed his brows and looked down at the ground, saying worriedly,
0:24:18|0:24:38|The man then took off his sunglasses and looked at [Changzi]. At that moment, [Changzi] standing by the table, looked at [Zhang Biao] in surprise. In the other corner of the guard station, Old Zhu was sitting by the stove, adjusting the hook made of twisted steel wire with pliers. Just as he was trying to flatten the bottom of the hook, Director Liu suddenly opened the door and looked at him, saying,
0:25:0|0:25:15|Old Zhu looked at Director Liu in front of him, gesturing for him to sit down with his right hand holding pliers. Then Old Zhu put down the hook that had already been formed in his hand, turned off the radio, and looked at him seriously, saying,
0:25:19|0:25:32|Director Liu, who was already seated, looked up as Old Zhu, with a smile on his face, lowered his head and busied himself with the task at hand.
0:25:42|0:26:6|With a furrowed brow, Zhu Guangsheng rubbed his hands on the stove and stopped his actions, pursing his lips. He suddenly looked up at Director Liu, then put down what was in his hands and calmly said, pretending to be composed. The honest and simple Zhu Cong did not think he had done anything wrong.
0:26:27|0:26:32|At this moment, the atmosphere in the room was extremely tense, and the two of them did not notice that [Zhu Lin] had walked in.
0:27:10|0:27:16|Following [Zhu Cong]'s pull of the trigger, as the gunshot rang out, the screen was covered in blood, with someone holding a hunting rifle in the snowy field.
0:27:20|0:27:24|After finishing speaking, [Changzi] turned around, closed his eyes tightly, and breathed heavily.
0:27:31|0:27:49|Changzi turned to Zhang Biao in shock, while Zhang Biao, who was looking for prey, put away his hunting gun and walked forward. The clumsy Changzi quickly picked up the rabbit on the ground and ran towards Zhang Biao. He grabbed Zhang Biao, almost slipping, and after stabilizing himself, he said,
0:27:55|0:28:4|[Zhang Biao] walked forward absentmindedly, [Changzi] immediately caught up. [Zhang Biao] stepped heavily on the snow, staring blankly at a spot not far away.
0:28:7|0:28:30|After listening to [Changzi]'s words, [Zhang Biao] instantly understood something. He then threw the bag containing the hunting rifle into the bushes. Slowly, he walked to the bag, squatted down, removed his gloves, raised the rifle high, aimed at Old Zhu's dog yard, scanned every dog, and finally aimed at the dog lying on the ground. His intense desire for revenge blinded his eyes, and without hesitation, he pulled the trigger.
0:28:30|0:28:36|The bullet swiftly pierced through the dog's head, and after a few whimpers, the dog collapsed into a pool of blood.
0:28:36|0:28:44|At this moment, the snow wolf on the mountain is watching from afar. Inside the forest station at night, [Zhu Guangsheng] stares blankly out the window.
0:29:9|0:29:15|As the two were talking, the dog outside the window kept barking. Upon hearing the noise, [Zhu Guangsheng] immediately looked towards it.
0:29:22|0:29:29|Don't do anything stupid. Soon after, [Zhu Guangsheng] in military coat, holding his drumstick, walked towards a residential house. Upon reaching the front gate, he urgently knocked on the door.
0:29:29|0:29:40|Seeing that no one opened the door, he increased the force in his hands. On the other side of the dog yard, [Zhang Biao] and [Changzi] sneaked into the kennel, where the dogs, sensing a strange presence, kept barking incessantly.
0:29:40|0:29:54|Walking in the front, [Zhang Biao] suddenly turned around and reached out his hand to [Changzi]. Understanding the signal, [Changzi] immediately handed over the stick in his hand. [Zhang Biao] took the stick and continued walking forward, while Blue Wave, locked in the cage, watched them calmly.
0:29:54|0:29:59|The next day, [Zhu Lin] anxiously opened the door and said to [Zhu Guangsheng], who was washing up,
0:30:6|0:30:19|[Zhu Guangsheng] carefully observed the object in his hand, furrowing his brows. Slowly, [Zhu Guangsheng] lifted his head, and the blue waves were locked on the iron fence.
0:30:37|0:30:52|The cook holding the money glanced at the locked Lanbo, bypassed [Changzi], and walked towards the house. Meanwhile, [Changzi] chewing gum remained in place, watching Lanbo struggling and showing a lewd smile. After Lanbo exhaustedly collapsed on the ground, [Changzi] was satisfied and turned to leave.
0:30:52|0:31:1|When Zhu Guangsheng saw him reaching for the chicken in the cage, he immediately stood up and stared closely at his back. Blue Wave kept scratching the iron gate with his claws.
0:31:1|0:31:9|And tried to climb over, but ultimately failed. [Changzi] walked towards the kitchen with the chicken, [Lan Bo] suddenly shouted, only to have the iron chain torn off.
0:31:25|0:31:48|The two of them arrived on the road, searching for the figure of [Lan Bo]. The cook pointed forward with a stick, but before they took a few steps, [Changzi] sat on the cook's lap. At that moment, [Lan Bo] suddenly stopped, turned around, and saw them about to catch up. [Lan Bo] immediately jumped into the abandoned courtyard, went through the window into the house, while [Changzi] and the cook kicked open the iron gate.
0:31:54|0:32:21|The nervous chef sat at the dining table, constantly tapping the tabletop with chopsticks. Suddenly, the door was pushed open, and he saw Zhu Guangsheng leaning against the door. He hurried over to Zhu's side. Zhu walked into the room unhurriedly, cautiously looking around and seeing no one. He then asked, and the chef, feeling flustered, ran into the kitchen.
0:32:21|0:32:30|Old Zhu walked slowly towards the large bowl of meat and wine on the table, pulled out the chair in the middle of the table, but he didn't sit down directly. Instead, he looked towards the direction of the kitchen.
0:32:30|0:32:56|He lifted his clothes and took out the big drum hammer hidden at his waist, then tucked it into his sleeve. After completing all the precautions, Old Zhu sat on the stool with a poker face, concealing the anger in his heart. Just then, the half-opened door was pushed open from the outside. Old Zhu turned his head slightly towards the door, only to see a person in black leather boots walking in. After closing the door, the person approached Old Zhu.
0:32:56|0:33:19|At this moment, Old Zhu turned his head disdainfully, and [Zhang Biao], who walked up to him, first placed his hand on his shoulder, then stared at him sharply with a fierce look in his eyes. Bending down and leaning his face next to him, he casually said, "Facing danger without fear." Old Zhu, facing his eyes, saw [Zhang Biao] with such a sharp look for the first time, it was a year ago when he was caught.
0:33:19|0:33:32|At that time, he hated Zhu Guangsheng for bringing the police. Now, Zhang Biao is seeking revenge on Zhu Guangsheng, causing his family to be destroyed. He then patted Zhu Guangsheng on the shoulder and slowly walked towards the center of the long table.
0:33:46|0:34:17|After finishing speaking, he picked up the white wine on the table and poured it into the empty glass. When the wine reached one-third of the glass, he closed the bottle. At this moment, Old Zhu ignored him, so he placed the glass in front of Old Zhu. Old Zhu, who didn't understand the meaning of this action, looked up at him. Old Zhu, who was glancing sideways at Zhang Biao, did not get angry because of his words. He disdainfully shifted his gaze to the table, placed his arm with the big drumstick hidden on the left on the table, and then picked up the glass of white wine with his right hand and took a big sip.
0:34:17|0:34:24|After hesitating for a moment, [Zhu Guangsheng] picked up a piece of meat from the basin and stuffed it into his mouth, chewing continuously.
0:34:29|0:34:36|Shortly after, a wave of nausea surged in Zhu Guangsheng's heart. He leaned over the table and vomited all the meat out. Zhang Biao, with a smug expression, burst into uncontrollable laughter.
0:34:40|0:34:46|[Zhu Guangsheng]’s face changed drastically, and in anger, he pulled out a large drumstick and swung it towards [Zhang Biao].
0:34:52|0:35:12|Seeing [Zhang Biao] lifting a stool to smash towards [Zhu Guangsheng], [Blue Wave] rushed in and bit his arm, with [Zhu Cong] and [Zhu Lin] following closely. Just as [Zhang Biao], who had just broken free from the jaws of [Blue Wave], was kicked to the ground by [Zhu Guangsheng], the panting [Zhu Guangsheng] first glanced at his daughters, then walked to the table to calm down the agitated [Blue Wave].
0:35:16|0:35:40|Zhu Guangsheng then turned to look at Changzi and the cook, who were scared in the corner by Lan Bo. Knowing that they were not bad people, he turned around and put the drumstick back into his sleeve. Burning with anger, he looked at the unharmed Lan Bo and decided not to pursue further. He then turned and walked towards the exit, but was stopped by the fallen Zhang Biao after a few steps. He looked at Zhang Biao helplessly.
0:35:40|0:35:44|Sensible [Zhang Biao] immediately moved aside to make way.
0:35:46|0:36:13|[Zhu Guangsheng] walked out of the room, followed closely by his two daughters. Then [Zhang Biao] slowly stood up, glaring fiercely at [Changzi]. Nervously, [Changzi] recounted the details of [Lan Bo]'s escape to [Zhang Biao]. The two of them chased after [Lan Bo] to an abandoned courtyard. When they saw [Lan Bo] hiding in a corner, they tried to scare him with sticks. However, fearless [Lan Bo], finding an opportunity, immediately jumped out of the window, bypassing the two of them.
0:36:1|0:36:35|The two who came up carefully observed every corner of the room. [Lan Bo] climbed out through the hole in the wall, and the two standing on the street watching the passing sheep were lost in thought. In a moment of inspiration, [Changzi] thought for a moment and the cook decisively said to add more cooking wine.
0:36:39|0:36:52|In a fit of anger, [Zhang Biao] overturned the long table, causing the two people in the corner to be scared and collapse against the wall again. However, [Zhang Biao] looked at them with a smile on his face.
0:37:3|0:37:10|Director Liu, who was on patrol, saw a man leading a horse not far away and shouted,
0:37:22|0:37:31|After Director Liu finished speaking, he drove away. The village chief continued to lead the horse forward, and then his colleagues helped Director Liu make a phone call and put it next to his ear.
0:37:42|0:38:1|On the other side, [Zhu Guangsheng] listened to the phone call and then walked towards the sheep pen with a hemp rope and a bundle of hay. The little lambs kept bleating when they saw [Zhu Guangsheng] approaching. After a moment of hesitation, [Zhu Guangsheng] first slung the hemp rope over his shoulder, then separated the hay and threw them in four different directions. He watched the little lambs huddled in a corner.
0:38:1|0:38:9|His gaze finally fell on the smallest one, and then [Zhu Guangsheng], who was stewing the meat, started cutting the vegetables.
0:38:29|0:38:35|After Director Liu finished speaking, he opened the bottle of wine and started pouring, but Zhu Guangsheng's mind was on the newly made tobacco pipe.
0:38:54|0:39:1|Director Liu put down Zhu Guangsheng's bowl, picked up his own bowl with chopsticks, and immediately put a piece into his mouth.
0:39:3|0:39:16|Director Liu, who couldn't bear it in his heart, said while eating meat, Zhu Guangsheng, who had no expression on his face, expressed helplessness about the matter. Director Liu, deep in thought, furrowed his brow.
0:39:26|0:39:40|After Zhu Guangsheng finished speaking frankly, he sat up straight, stretched out his hands to look at him. Director Liu ignored him and instead put down the bowl and chopsticks, took out a large amount of cash from his jacket pocket and handed it to him.
0:39:54|0:39:57|Director Liu stood up and snatched it back, and after sitting down, he put the money back in place.
0:40:12|0:40:18|Director Liu, who was inexplicably called by Lan Bo, raised his head and asked Zhu Guangsheng.
0:40:22|0:40:28|Director Liu looked at Zhu Guangsheng in disbelief, his face full of shock. The more he thought about it, the more disgusted he became, and he immediately spat out all the meat in his mouth.
0:40:36|0:40:57|He drank the wine in his hand in one gulp, and at this moment, Lanbo also stopped making noise and quietly lay on the ground watching [Zhu Guangsheng]. The next day, [Zhu Guangsheng] took his old partner and two daughters to pick up garbage near the dog field. He walked in the front with a large bamboo basket on his back, while [Zhu Cong] carried a small basket and [Zhu Lin] walked beside him. The old partner on the hillside picked up garbage alone, and the sensible Lanbo carried the garbage towards [Zhu Guangsheng].
0:40:57|0:41:9|They tied the collected plastic bags to the fence of the dog field, adding a different scene to the single Tian Shan forest with colorful garbage bags.
0:41:16|0:41:28|In the dog kennel, Zhu Guangsheng and two others stood up and walked towards the outside. The man at the front stood at the door, patted his arm, then turned to Zhu Guangsheng behind him and said,
0:41:30|0:41:36|After the veterinarian finished speaking, [Zhu Guangsheng] turned to look at the dog kennel, the anxious [Zhu Guangsheng] softly inquired of the veterinarian,
0:41:54|0:41:58|Upon hearing the price, [Zhu Guangsheng] instinctively clenched his fists, unable to bear giving up these dogs.
0:41:58|0:42:5|He watched absentmindedly as the doctor left with his hat in hand, while on the other side, [Zhu Guangsheng]'s wife rummaged through boxes and cabinets searching for something.
0:42:5|0:42:12|In a fit of anger, she slammed the empty handbag on the table in front of Zhu Guangsheng, who was drinking.
0:42:12|0:42:27|[Zhu Guangsheng] held a bottle of wine in one hand, feeling troubled, he slowly spoke. His wife beside him was very impatient. [Zhu Guangsheng] lowered his head nervously and answered slowly. Hearing his response, the angry wife slapped [Zhu Guangsheng]'s shoulder heavily.
0:42:37|0:42:44|[Zhu Guangsheng], who was mentioned, shamelessly continued to speak.
0:42:50|0:43:1|[Zhu Guangsheng] glanced at his gasping wife out of the corner of his eye, filled with regret and no expression on his face. Just as he was about to pick up the wine glass, his wife snatched it from him and threw it to the ground.
0:43:39|0:43:50|The provocation from his wife's words made [Zhu Guangsheng] even more irritable at the moment. As his wife struggled to get up from the ground, she said,
0:43:51|0:44:13|After his wife walked out of the door without looking back, enraged [Zhu Guangsheng] stared at the handbag on the table and angrily threw it to the ground. [Zhu Guangsheng] was torn between two choices, caught in endless dilemma. He looked at the blue waves in front of him, sticking out their tongues at him, but in the end, he stuck to his inner self. The azure sky framed the towering peaks, with endless forests winding below the snow line.
0:44:13|0:44:19|[Zhu Guangsheng] sat on the hillside with a radio and a blue wave, settling his anxious mood.
0:44:25|0:44:39|[Zhu Guangsheng] stopped his movements, placed the water bottle down, and took the money handed to him by [Dr. Niu]. He lightly flicked his fingers and began counting the money. Just then, a mountain bike slowly came to a stop in front of his house.
0:45:8|0:45:16|[Zhu Guangsheng] lowered his head in confusion, and after a moment of contemplation, he sighed softly and looked at Boss Qin, pleading.
0:45:32|0:45:37|Boss Qin pulled the man selling sheep intestines away, while [Zhu Guangsheng] stood in place watching them go.
0:45:40|0:46:5|[Zhu Guangsheng] looked helplessly at the limited amount of cash in his hand. In the afternoon, as he was washing the horse on the slope, [Zhu Cong] shouted. After speaking, she turned her head back to continue with her work. [Zhu Cong] urged Lanbo to walk towards the intersection. She carried a single-shoulder bag, with her hands in her pockets. Curious Lanbo followed beside her, trying to get her attention.
0:46:5|0:46:24|As she reached the doorway, she suddenly stopped, turned to look at her father's busy figure, [Zhu Cong] couldn't bear to see her father in such distress. She then lowered her head and took out a small stack of money from her pocket, spreading the money out in her hand. Looking at the limited amount of money, she hoped to do her best to help her father with her meager contribution.
0:46:24|0:46:43|He watched as Lanbo returned to his father and then turned to leave. [Zhu Guangsheng] heard Lanbo calling out and turned back, only to see Lanbo running towards him. He opened his arms and embraced Lanbo, but as he was comforting him, he noticed some money attached to Lanbo's dog leash. He took the money off and looked in the direction where [Zhu Cong] had left.
0:46:43|0:47:8|At this moment, [Zhu Guangsheng] was feeling a mix of emotions in his heart. He looked at the dog kennel he had built at the foot of the mountain with his own hands, and recalled recent events with deep regret. He stood under the national flag in front of the kennel, solemnly put on his hat, let out a long sigh, and then set off. Before long, his feet were on the stairs. After hesitating for a moment, he walked with heavy steps to the pawnshop's door, pushed it open, and handed over the property deed.
0:47:39|0:47:58|[Zhu Lin] leaned against the rock, holding Lanbo in his arms, swallowing his tears. [Zhu Cong] turned and walked towards the foot of the mountain, but halfway through, he turned back. After speaking, [Zhu Cong] turned angrily and walked down the hill. The sorrowful [Zhu Lin] held Lanbo in his arms, feeling heartbroken and unwilling to give away Lanbo, whom he had raised with his own hands.
0:47:58|0:48:2|In the luxurious villa, [Zhu Cong] turned around as he was walking out and said,
0:48:2|0:48:12|[Zhu Lin] walked out of the house, unwillingly looking back. She pouted as she walked to the side of the gate, then she leaned against the iron gate, caressing the tied-up [Wang Rong] with reluctance.
0:48:13|0:48:22|[Zhu Cong] forcibly dragged [Zhu Lin] away, ignoring [Wang Rong]'s pleas as she refused to let go. As the two approached the shuttle bus, [Zhu Cong] instructed [Zhu Lin] to walk ahead, and at the moment they were boarding the bus,
0:48:22|0:48:47|[Zhu Lin] wanted to take another look at [Wang Rong], but [Zhu Cong] pushed her directly onto the bus. As the two got on the bus, [Wang Rong] lay on the iron gate, howling continuously through the air. The bus started and drove away, and the anxious [Wang Rong] realized the danger. It suddenly broke free from the rope around its neck and swiftly ran out of the gate towards the direction the bus was heading. By this time, the bus had already left the urban area and was traveling on a winding mountain road.
0:48:47|0:49:4|Wang Rong, who is trying her best, closely follows behind the bus, while Zhu Lin inside the bus sits with a worried expression, and Zhu Cong sitting behind her keeps comforting her. Soon, the bus arrives at the pasture, and as it passes through the woods, a small figure can still be seen chasing after the bus.
0:49:4|0:49:17|When Wang Rong arrived at the forest, the bus stopped. She stood at the fork in the road, looking left and right constantly. Watching the bus getting further away, she glanced at the side road and, torn between choices, she ultimately chose to trust herself.
0:49:18|0:49:24|It swiftly crossed the snow-covered fields, then immediately used its agile limbs to climb over the mountains after crossing the wall.
0:49:25|0:49:32|As a forest ranger's beloved dog, [Wang Rong] is quite familiar with the terrain of this area, always able to find a shortcut home.
0:49:32|0:49:42|At this moment, the two sisters had already gotten off the bus and were walking on a small path in the mountains. When [Wang Rong], who was looking for the way home, saw a familiar figure, she immediately ran towards it.
0:49:43|0:50:2|Originally frowning, [Zhu Lin] quickly pulled out the hand stuck in his pocket upon hearing [Wang Rong]'s call, and ran towards Lanbo with all his might. Overjoyed, [Zhu Lin] knelt on the ground, embracing [Wang Rong], while behind them, [Zhu Cong] looked at [Wang Rong] in shock. She never expected that [Wang Rong] would actually find her way home alone.
0:50:2|0:50:11|At this moment, [Wang Rong] buried her head in [Zhu Lin]'s arms, coquettishly. In the evening, a divorce agreement lay slanted on the table by the bed. Old Zhu sat by the stove and said,
0:50:17|0:50:43|Wife, with no expression on her face, looks at the photo on the wall. The once loving couple has now reached this point. [Zhu Guangsheng] decides to shoulder all the responsibilities. His wife remains unmoved, still staring at the photo. [Zhu Guangsheng] drinks up the wine in his hand in frustration. At this moment, even if he is reluctant, he must learn to let go. He doesn't want to burden his wife and children, making them suffer with him.
0:50:44|0:51:8|He then slowly tightened the cap of the bottle, as if sealing this past memory inside the bottle. He gently placed the bottle on the box beside him, looking at it. He let out a deep sigh, then picked up the hat next to him, stood up, and walked towards the door with heavy steps. After a few steps, he stopped and stood at the bedroom door, bowing his head to his wife's back, and said,
0:51:13|0:51:39|After saying that and receiving no response from his wife, he walked out of the room. His wife stood in front of the cabinet, looking at herself through the glass of a photo frame. She held back tears, not letting them fall. The frames on the wall were filled with photos of their two daughters when they were young, each photo accompanied by a dog. Outside, the world was covered in white, with snowflakes falling gently from the dim sky.
0:51:39|0:52:0|Covering the world with a thick blanket of snow, [Zhu Guangsheng] walked along the path with Blue Wave, gradually getting farther away. On the other side, his wife sat by the stove, holding a divorce agreement, looking lost and staring blankly ahead. Exhausted, [Zhu Guangsheng] sat on a snow-covered log halfway up the hill, while Blue Wave obediently sat by his side.
0:52:0|0:52:6|At this moment, he felt extremely empty inside, with only himself and a dog left in what used to be a warm and happy home.
0:52:6|0:52:15|After an unknown period of time, a layer of snow also fell on [Zhu Guangsheng] and Lan Bo. The distant mountain peaks were stacked layer by layer, covered with one layer of white snow after another.
0:52:15|0:52:24|Like the towering waves in the sea. The next morning, snow continued to fall in the early hours, with snowflakes fluttering down accompanied by the chilling winter wind.
0:52:24|0:52:34|Feeling inexplicably lonely, after packing up the luggage, his wife hung the room key on the wall outside the door, holding a bag in one hand, and walked out with heavy steps.
0:52:34|0:52:37|It's hard to imagine things would develop to such an extent.
0:52:37|0:52:57|As she walked halfway up the slope, she was immediately drawn to the windmill in front of her. The windmill stood tall in the wind and snow, constantly turning with a creaking sound that evoked memories for the two. Just as she slowly lowered her head, she saw the dog farm opposite. The dog farm was also covered with snow at this time, with only the five-starred red flag hanging in the air fluttering in the wind.
0:52:58|0:53:4|For some reason, the dogs in the kennel kept barking incessantly, perhaps calling for [Zhu Guangsheng] to come home.
0:53:4|0:53:25|At this moment, the wife also realized that she should not have tried to extinguish Zhu Guangsheng's dream. Without fully understanding the situation, she angrily blamed Zhu Guangsheng. Now, she continued along the path, kicking the door of Zhang Biao's house. When Zhang Biao opened the door, she simply pushed it open, causing the bottle at the door to fall.
0:53:31|0:53:38|[Zhang Biao] leaned against the door frame helplessly looking at her, she vented her anger on [Zhang Biao], who in turn questioned her.
0:53:56|0:54:17|Before [Zhang Biao] could finish speaking, tears welled up in her eyes, but [Zhang Biao] paid no attention and simply reached out to close the door. His wife, standing outside the door, helplessly sobbed, then turned around and leaned against the nearby railing to compose herself. However, when she saw the countless bottles of alcohol lined up on the steps outside the door, she fell into deep thought instantly.
0:54:17|0:54:35|On the other side, many elderly and middle-aged people are rehearsing in an orderly manner on the square. With lively music playing, they dance joyfully to the beat of the drums. A police car comes into view and slowly stops in front of several women. The women then approach, and Director Liu gets out of the car and says,
0:54:50|0:55:12|Several women forcibly pushed [Director Liu] onto the dance floor, but he showed no fear at all. He stood in the center of the crowd, moving effortlessly and maintaining his dignity. His movements were perfectly timed with the music, and just as he was enjoying the happiness brought by dancing, his phone suddenly rang. He took out his phone while still following the rhythm.
0:55:20|0:55:29|Old Zhu sat dejectedly on the grassy bank, then he slowly lifted his head to look at [Director Liu]. In an instant, understanding dawned on [Director Liu], who dropped his cigarette butt and walked towards him, saying,
0:55:43|0:55:58|Old Zhu pursed his lips and buried his head in his scarf, [Director Liu] walked to his side and patted his shoulder, gesturing for him to move to the other side. Then [Director Liu] sat down next to him, while Old Zhu remained stubborn.
0:56:10|0:56:36|Director Liu saw Zhu Guangsheng unmoved, so he punched him. Zhu Guangsheng was now staring at the ground in a flustered state. Director Liu, furious, stood up and walked to directly face Zhu Guangsheng. Zhu Guangsheng then raised his head, squinting at him. Director Liu pointed at him and scolded, then helplessly stood up straight. Director Liu, preparing to put his hands in his pockets in anger, but before he could, he pointed at Zhu Guangsheng.
0:56:41|0:56:48|After Director Liu finished speaking, he started the car and drove past Old Zhu, who raised his head and watched him leave.
0:56:48|0:57:0|[Zhu Guangsheng] looked pensive as he held the whip in his hand. In the hospital, his wife entered the ward carrying fruits. She first glanced at the patient next to her being taken care of by family members, while the patient in front of her was lying on the side, asleep.
0:57:0|0:57:10|She gently placed the fruit on the bedside table, then pushed the woman gently after observing carefully. The woman woke up inexplicably and turned her head slowly to look at Zhu Guangsheng's wife, Wang Rong.
0:57:32|0:57:52|The wife then began to tidy up. Upon hearing that it was their son's arrangement, the woman felt relieved. On the other side, [Zhu Guangsheng] carried a large bamboo basket and walked towards the deep mountains. He then slowly shoveled the pristine snow into the basket. When the snow exceeded the basket, he even patted it with a shovel. Exhausted, he leaned the shovel against the ground.
0:57:53|0:58:14|With one hand holding a shovel and the other adjusting his hat, he then lifted the bamboo basket and retraced his steps. He carefully walked on the uneven mountain path, afraid of spilling the snow in the basket. When he returned home, [Zhu Guangsheng] poured all the snow from the bamboo basket into a large iron basin. He placed the basket on the ground, panting heavily, and then he scooped up a handful of snow and ate it.
0:58:14|0:58:28|While he kept chewing, he also observed the snow in the basin. Then he took out the burning charcoal from the stove and placed it under the basin. As he adjusted the charcoal, his eldest daughter [Zhu Cong] entered through the door and walked slowly forward.
0:58:36|0:58:43|After Zhu Guangsheng finished speaking, he stood up. Both of them looked at the accumulated snow in the basin. Zhu Guangsheng wiped the iron tongs in his hand.
0:58:49|0:58:58|[Zhu Cong] nodded in response. Then [Zhu Guangsheng] walked out of the door with a bamboo basket, [Zhu Cong] stood behind watching his father's figure disappear at the moment the door closed.
0:58:58|0:59:12|The thick snow in the basin gradually melted under the heating of charcoal. The father's love for his children is deep and broad. They only understand silent dedication and are not good at expressing themselves. He needs to take on the responsibility of being a father and be responsible for the family.
0:59:12|0:59:16|As the snow water kept heating up, steam quickly rose.
0:59:16|0:59:39|[Zhu Lin] stepped into the iron basin with the help of her sister. With her thin body, her back resembled layers of overlapping mountains, and her delicate arms naturally hung on both sides of her body. At this moment, she let her hair down and lowered her head, watching her sister wash her straight long legs. Then she bent over as her sister poured water over her head with a ladle. But just as her sister turned around to fetch more water, she suddenly shook her head.
0:59:39|0:59:49|The splashing water landed on the sister's face, and she immediately grabbed a handful of water and sprinkled it towards [Zhu Lin]. [Zhu Lin] instinctively dodged the water coming towards her face, and soon she was all washed up.
0:59:49|0:59:59|Later, Old Zhu used an iron shovel to scoop out the charcoal at the bottom of the basin and put it back into the furnace. Then he placed the stool and basin at the corner of the basin. Just as he was cleaning up, [Wang Rong] jumped into the basin.
1:0:4|1:0:27|Old Zhu walked to [Wang Rong], constantly stroking its head. Then he took off his jacket, sat on a stool, carefully wiped [Wang Rong], and used a ladle to rinse it. While rinsing, he kept rubbing it with his hands. After Old Zhu finished washing [Wang Rong], it playfully shook its fur. Meanwhile, [Changzi] dashed into the pool, splashing water onto the face of [Zhang Biao] nearby.
1:0:40|1:0:46|After [Zhang Biao] finished speaking, he tilted his head back in contemplation and then suddenly looked towards [Changzi].
1:0:51|1:1:2|[Zhang Biao] waved his hand in the water, signaling [Changzi] to come forward. The two locked eyes, plotting something unknown. Inside the dance hall, [Changzi] pulled [Zhu Cong] aside and said,
1:1:8|1:1:43|[Zhu Cong]'s expression instantly became tense. [Zhu Cong] grabbed [Changzi], who was about to leave. [Changzi] furrowed his brows, not understanding [Zhu Cong]'s actions. After speaking, [Changzi] helplessly turned and left. [Zhu Cong] then instantly slumped against the wall. Old Zhu walked his horse through the snowy slope in the deep mountains. The higher he went, the deeper the snow became, and he struggled to move forward in the snow that reached his knees.
1:1:43|1:2:4|Wearing heavy clothes, he kept panting heavily as he climbed up the hill. Once he reached the top, he mounted his horse to continue his mountain patrol. The man, the horse, and the dog gradually disappeared from view. Meanwhile, [Changzi] slowly climbed the stairs. He walked up to [Zhang Biao], handing him a black bottle while catching his breath. [Zhang Biao] took the bottle and carefully examined the words "sulfuric acid" written on it.
1:2:5|1:2:32|At night, in the nightclub, colorful lights flickered overhead. Accompanied by strong drumbeats, the dancers gracefully danced. On the stage, [Zhu Cong] had already noticed [Zhang Biao] sitting in the audience. Her slender silk dress fluttered in the wind, the swirling long sleeves crisscrossed, and her continuous graceful movements danced and scattered. Her twisting body and merging hands and feet, light and agile dance moves, as light as a swallow, her body soft as cotton, her arms delicate and boneless, every step giving rise to a lotus, flower-like dance moves, like butterflies dancing among the flowers.
1:2:32|1:2:35|Stirring [Zhang Biao]'s heart.
1:2:35|1:2:53|At this moment, [Zhang Biao] is staring intently at [Zhu Cong] on the stage, afraid that he may have already forgotten the purpose of his visit. While [Zhu Cong] is dancing, she occasionally looks towards [Zhang Biao], her captivating big eyes making [Zhang Biao] enchanted and amazed by her elegant and graceful radiance.
1:2:53|1:3:7|Every move of [Zhang Biao] stirred Zhu Guangsheng's heartstrings. As she completed the final move, she fixed a coquettish gaze on [Zhang Biao], then slowly exited the stage. Below the stage, [Zhang Biao] watched her departure direction with reluctance.
1:3:7|1:3:23|Later, as [Zhu Cong] walked out of the nightclub, someone suddenly called out to her. Two people approached her, [Zhang Biao] turned around and, with his eyes, accused [Changzi].
1:4:11|1:4:19|[Zhang Biao] grabbed [Zhu Cong] but was quickly overpowered by her. After saying a few words, she released [Zhang Biao] and walked away without looking back.
1:4:33|1:4:38|When [Zhang Biao] was about to leave, [Changzi] immediately called out to him.
1:4:43|1:4:53|After saying that, he turned and left. Then [Changzi] used his mouth to bite off the bottle cap, tilted his head back, and took a big gulp.
1:5:5|1:5:15|She then looked at [Zhang Biao] and said, the sudden praise from [Zhang Biao] made [Zhu Cong] ecstatic. Shocked beyond belief, [Zhu Cong] never expected that [Zhang Biao] would go to great lengths to raise 100,000 yuan for her.
1:5:20|1:5:35|At this moment, [Zhang Biao], who was deeply in love, immediately turned and walked out of the room upon hearing these words. [Changzi] glanced at [Zhu Cong] and followed suit with a shake of his head. Later, [Zhang Biao] deliberately tidied up before arriving at [Zhu Cong]'s house. He walked briskly to Old Zhu with a gift box in his hands.
1:6:10|1:6:20|Old Zhu looked at Zhang Biao in front of him, suppressing the anger in his heart. He didn't understand why this person always appeared in his life. So he walked up slowly, stared at Zhang Biao, and angrily rebuked,
1:7:4|1:7:14|Lan Bo was tightly held by the old buddy of the dog farm, Old Zhu's eyes were full of anger. He then went to the place where [Zhu Cong] worked, followed closely by [Zhu Lin]. Old Zhu walked up to [Zhu Cong] and slapped her directly in the face.
1:7:52|1:8:12|[Zhu Cong] vented all the words that had been buried deep in her heart. After speaking, she turned and left. Seeing this, [Zhu Lin] immediately chased after her. At this moment, the old Zhu was deeply struck in his heart by [Zhu Cong]'s words. He didn't know that all he had insisted on had brought so much harm to this family. Helplessly, he seemed frozen in place, unable to move for a long time. He watched [Zhu Cong] gradually disappear into the distance.
1:8:12|1:8:23|Feeling guilty, when he returned home at night, [Zhu Guangsheng] lit the candle in the corner with a lighter, then took out the ink and placed it in front of the mirror. He turned the pot upside down and rubbed his fingers in the pot ash.
1:8:42|1:9:2|Old Zhu outlined the makeup of the martial artist with simple materials. Then he stood on a slope, wearing a mouthpiece made of a ponytail and accompanied by Peking opera music. He accurately stepped on every drum beat, with a wide and loud tone, singing with a strong and thick voice, and his movements were distinct and abrupt. [Zhu Guangsheng] and the old companion from the dog farm sat on both sides of the bonfire.
1:9:46|1:9:58|He is wearing a disguised mask at the moment, but his inner wisdom is awakened. Under the moonlight, he looks into the distance, trying not to let tears flow again. He uses the song to shout out all the pent-up frustration in his heart.
1:10:8|1:10:30|He shouted out his inner dissatisfaction with the climax of the opera, his face turning red, veins popping on his neck, the whole canyon echoing with his voice. Gradually, he calmed down, tears in his eyes as he slowly looked up at the endless night sky. By then, the moon was half hidden behind the mountains, still shining brightly.
1:10:30|1:10:49|Returning to the room, [Zhu Guangsheng] looked at himself in the mirror, tears uncontrollably streaming down his face. The fragmented mirror reflected different angles of him, and with a furrowed brow, he comforted himself by saying that he silently gave his all behind the scenes, but most of the pain was something he had to bear alone.
1:10:49|1:10:59|Tears streaming down his face, he looked at his weathered self in front of him. As he spoke with a choked voice, he ultimately buried all his feelings deep in his heart.
1:10:59|1:11:3|He then let out a deep sigh and bowed to his reflection in the mirror.
1:11:3|1:11:6|In the hospital, [Zhang Biao] is washing towels in the basin.
1:11:16|1:11:28|He wiped the water on his hands on his pants, bent down to support his mother's shoulders, helping her sit up slowly. After tidying up the blanket, he sat behind his mother and reached the towel into her clothes, helping her wipe her back.
1:11:41|1:11:50|The mother slowly turned her head to look at [Zhang Biao] in front of her, with a pensive expression and a furrowed brow.
1:12:12|1:12:18|At this moment, [Zhang Biao] stopped his actions and looked at his mother.
1:12:24|1:12:30|The atmosphere between the two suddenly became poignant, with [Zhang Biao] tightly hugging his mother.
1:12:32|1:12:56|After speaking, she leaned on [Zhang Biao]'s shoulder, holding onto his arms tightly, while the Zhang Biao behind her held his mother, trying to hold back tears. The next morning, Old Zhu walked in the deep mountains with a dog, surrounded by white mist between heaven and earth. The nearby flowers, grass, and trees were all intermittently visible in the thick fog. He struggled to climb the hill with the dog, occasionally stopping to observe the surroundings, while [Zhu Cong], with a backpack on her shoulder, walked out of the gate on the other side.
1:12:56|1:13:14|Walking on the familiar path as usual, Zhu Rong suddenly felt someone following her. When she entered the alley, she looked back but didn't see anything. However, she quickened her pace and the person behind her started to run when she disappeared from view.
1:13:14|1:13:27|At this moment, [Zhu Cong] also ran into the alley. She carefully observed her surroundings, and seeing no one around, she quickly took a shortcut and ran out. Startled, [Zhu Cong] left after confirming the situation. However, as she walked between two cars, she was suddenly stopped.
1:14:2|1:14:15|After speaking, he turned to look at [Zhu Cong]. [Zhu Cong] was so scared by the knife in front of him that he dared not speak. Just then, the traffic police officer maintaining order walked over from the opposite side. Inside the car, [Zhang Biao] instantly became nervous, while [Changzi] immediately turned around and rolled down the window of the driver's seat.
1:14:28|1:14:35|The car continued to drive on. In the hospital on the other side, Zhang Biao's mother was talking to Zhu Guangsheng's wife.
1:14:43|1:14:52|After listening, Old Zhu's wife became cautious instantly, frowning as she pondered repeatedly. The thick snow in the deep mountains was trampled by the three men.
1:14:52|1:15:14|With shallow footprints, [Zhang Biao] walked at the front, looking around, while the fat man behind struggled to move forward with [Zhu Cong] tied up. Under the clear sky and gentle breeze, the snow-capped mountains stood against the blue sky, sitting on the vast land. Fluffy white clouds lightly surrounded the waist of the majestic mountain. At the foot of the mountain, there was a dense forest of green pines and cypresses.
1:15:14|1:15:30|At the same time, Old Zhu continued to shuttle through the misty deep mountains with his dog. Looking up, the snow-capped mountain peak piercing through the clouds was faintly visible in the swirling mist, with layers of grey and white rugged rocks on the mountainside, constantly changing and countless silver glaciers flowing for miles.
1:15:30|1:15:49|[Zhu Guangsheng] walked in the snow with his dog, taking one step at a time. The white snow healed his heart. He then stood in the snow-covered stream, ready to pull Blue Wave out. However, he stumbled and fell down. After making sure Blue Wave was unharmed, he simply lay down, closed his eyes slowly. Blue Wave obediently stayed by his side.
1:15:49|1:16:4|Exhausted, [Zhu Cong] sat down in the snow, unable to move any further. She chose to compromise with [Zhang Biao], panting heavily due to severe physical exhaustion.
1:16:12|1:16:20|Changzi quickly moved behind Zhu Cong, while Zhang Biao watched quietly as Changzi untied the rope for Zhu Cong. Inside the car, Director Liu's phone rang.
1:16:26|1:16:43|They quickly headed to Zhu Guangsheng's home. At this moment, Zhu Guangsheng had already driven Zhu Lin and Lan Bo to search for Zhu Cong. Despite the muddy road ahead, he never stopped. Zhu Guangsheng, who was still angry, furrowed his brow and said helplessly,
1:16:56|1:17:8|Urgently turning the steering wheel, the car only came to a stop when it got stuck in a muddy pit. On the other side of the mountain, the three people slowly approached a dilapidated cabin. Leading the way, [Zhang Biao] kept a close eye on the corner of the cabin.
1:17:8|1:17:32|Finally, he cautiously observed the surroundings and, after confirming no one was around, he walked towards the raised area on the ground of the cabin. He knelt down at the raised spot and directly used his hands to shovel away the accumulated snow on the surface. Soon, a wooden box was revealed on the ground. He urgently opened it, tearing off the surface parchment to reveal a gun. [Zhu Cong] covered her mouth in shock, while [Zhang Biao] raised the gun and aimed at [Zhu Cong] and [Changzi].
1:17:48|1:17:56|Just then, snow started to fall at the place where [Zhu Guangsheng] had the accident. Snowflakes drifted down from the gray sky, gradually increasing in size.
1:17:56|1:18:7|The light snowflakes turned into heavy snow, creating a silent atmosphere. The car stuck in the mud kept flashing its hazard lights, while [Zhu Guangsheng] inside the car lay motionless on the steering wheel.
1:18:7|1:18:20|Sitting in the back row, Lanbo was unharmed. It used its mouth to nudge Zhu Guangsheng, who was barely conscious. Seeing no response from him, Lanbo turned to nudge Zhu Lin, who was semi-conscious, and quickly woke him up.
1:18:23|1:18:33|[Zhu Guangsheng] gradually woke up under the shaking of [Zhu Lin]. He slowly lifted his head, but blood kept flowing from the corner of his mouth. After saying that, [Zhu Lin] anxiously searched the pockets of his coat.
1:18:37|1:18:45|[Zhu Lin] took out a tissue to wipe the blood from the corner of Old Zhu's mouth, while Old Zhu turned his head and tried hard to move his body out of the car.
1:18:55|1:18:59|At this moment, [Lan Bo] in the car seemed to sense something? He kept barking wildly.
1:18:59|1:19:6|In an instant, Zhu Guangsheng, who understood Blue Wave's actions, cautiously observed the surroundings. Following the sound, he unexpectedly saw the silhouette of a wolf on the mountain.
1:19:8|1:19:14|He comforted [Zhu Lin] while observing the movements of the wolves, and the wolves on the hill had also noticed them in the car.
1:19:16|1:19:27|The wolves on the mountaintop, following the calls of their companions, one by one came down to the foot of the mountain. They surrounded Old Zhu's car from different directions, while Old Zhu inside the car remained completely unaware of all this.
1:19:35|1:19:54|Old Zhu, who was gradually calming down, suddenly realized what was happening. After mentioning Old Zhou, he immediately started the car, and the dazzling headlights formed two beams of light. At the same time, the wolf's eyes were illuminated by the beams, instantly turning white. The wolf pack then began to retreat one by one, looking back reluctantly. However, due to their fear of the light, they had to give up first.
1:20:0|1:20:13|[Zhu Lin] bravely turned around in response to his father's encouragement and rolled down the car window. Old Zhu, seeing the window roll down through the rearview mirror, turned his head and leaned back in his seat, watching [Lan Bo] panting in the back seat. He then said to [Lan Bo],
1:20:20|1:20:55|Old Zhu placed all his hopes on [Blue Wave], gasping for breath due to his serious injuries. At this moment, [Blue Wave] seemed to understand Old Zhu's words, responding with soft whinnies. Deep in trouble, Old Zhu could only try his luck. Upon receiving the command, [Blue Wave] immediately jumped out of the window. With his last bit of strength, Old Zhu shouted out and then threw his hat out of the window. [Blue Wave] leaped and caught it smoothly, following Old Zhu's instructions, running forward along the direction of the car lights. It ran with all its might, never stopping.
1:20:56|1:21:8|When [Lan Bo] ran out of the danger zone, the car lights began to flicker, but the wolves did not leave. They watched as the car lights gradually disappeared, then stared at the car with baleful eyes, and started a new action.
1:21:8|1:21:20|The wolf pack, under the leader's call, is preparing to attack again. At this moment, Old Zhu is unprepared. The clever wolves change their strategy, silently crawling from behind the car. When the wolves start to pry open the car window,
1:21:25|1:21:46|[Zhu Lin] bravely rolled up the car window quickly and successfully blocked the wolf pack's attack. Seeing their failed attempt, the wolves halfway up the mountain quickly ran down to the car. The large number of wolves surrounded the van, and at the forest station, [Director Liu] drove the police car quickly to Old Zhu's house. As soon as the car stopped, he got out and walked straight into the house.
1:21:52|1:22:4|At this moment, Lanbo carried the hat to the door. When Zhu Guangsheng's wife noticed it, Lanbo immediately turned and ran in another direction. It quickly ran to the door of the old buddy living in the dog yard, barking wildly, successfully waking up the old buddy.
1:22:5|1:22:12|As Zhu Guangsheng walked out of the room, he saw Lanbo barking wildly at him, and he also noticed that all the dogs in the kennel had become agitated.
1:22:13|1:22:31|He then quickly ran towards the dog kennel with a flashlight, opening each cage at the fastest speed, releasing all the dogs inside. They ran out of the kennel one by one, quickly following Blue Wave to support Lao Zhu. Meanwhile, Lao Zhu's wife and [Director Liu] drove around investigating Lao Zhu's whereabouts.
1:22:44|1:23:7|Worriedly nodding, the wife, trapped in the car, fearfully hides in Old Zhu's arms. At this moment, Old Zhu looks in horror at the wolves outside the car window, their mouths wide open as they roam around. Some eager wolves keep scratching at the windows. Director Liu immediately organizes the police officers to rescue people in the Grand Canyon. The convoy sets off immediately, heading to the destination at the fastest speed.
1:23:7|1:23:27|On the winding mountain road, the sound of sirens echoed continuously. Blue Wave led his companions to take the nearest path, their only goal at this moment being to rush to the front of Old Zhu. However, suddenly, snow started falling from the densely clouded sky, large snowflakes drifting down gently, yet this did not affect the footsteps of the advancing wolf dogs.
1:23:27|1:23:32|On the other side, [Zhang Biao] faced [Zhu Cong] and said that he had lost his reason for love.
1:23:37|1:23:44|He stood in the center of Lover's Valley, looking sincerely at [Zhu Cong]. In his eyes at this moment, there was only the figure of [Zhu Cong].
1:24:6|1:24:12|Zhang Biao's words came from the bottom of his heart, Zhu Cong had never seen such a devoted man.
1:24:38|1:24:48|As he spoke, a smile appeared on [Zhang Biao]'s face. He quickly took the hunting rifle off his back, while [Changzi] and [Zhu Cong] were frightened and kept backing away.
1:24:55|1:25:3|Zhang Biao raised the gun above his head, but his phone suddenly rang. He immediately took off his gloves, took out the phone, and answered it as soon as he saw the display screen.
1:25:13|1:25:19|Zhang Biao moved his body, and at this moment, scenes of Zhu Guangsheng's wife taking care of her mother in the hospital appeared in his mind.
1:25:27|1:25:42|Listening to his mother's words, Zhang Biao slowly put down his phone and watched as [Zhu Cong] also lowered the hunting rifle in his hand. Then [Zhu Guangsheng]'s wife called [Zhu Cong] in a hurry, asking for his exact location at the moment.
1:25:50|1:26:5|On the other side of the Wild Wolf Ravine, [Zhu Lin], who was hiding behind [Zhu Lin], held a wrench in front of him. The wolves kept attacking the car, and with their claws, they kept scratching at the seams of the windows. As more and more wolves climbed up, [Zhu Guangsheng] tried to scare them off with the wrench, but to his surprise, they were not afraid and instead attacked even more fiercely.
1:26:6|1:26:29|Suddenly a wolf's claw reached into the driver's cabin, [Zhu Guangsheng] decisively used a dagger to cut the wolf's claw, causing the wolf to cry out in pain and then jump out of the window. [Zhu Guangsheng] quickly rolled up the car window. At that moment, the wolf dogs finally crossed the mountain and arrived by [Zhu Guangsheng's] side. Sitting in the car, [Zhu Guangsheng] stared in astonishment at the approaching pack of wolf dogs.
1:26:29|1:26:46|He never expected that Lan Bo would bring all his companions over. Lan Bo, who was running at the front, headed straight towards him. At that moment, the leader of the wolves also noticed Lan Bo. The leader stared at Lan Bo, baring its sharp teeth and howling, as if conveying a message to its companions.
1:26:46|1:27:6|The wolf pack, upon receiving the message, turned around and looked around. Leading the way, Zhu Guangsheng rushed towards them without hesitation, followed closely by a large number of wolfhounds. After determining their direction, the wolf pack ran in groups towards them. The innate fierceness and pride of the wolves made them fearless of the wolfhounds in front of them.
1:27:6|1:27:17|The outstanding intelligence, patience, organization, and discipline of the wolf pack are fully demonstrated at this moment. In the dim night, the empty mountains, and the tranquil forest, the sound of wolves and dogs fighting echoes everywhere.
1:27:17|1:27:39|In the car, [Zhu Guangsheng] tightly held [Zhu Lin] in his arms, covering her eyes with his hands, unable to let her see the cruel scene. Just then, a wolf ran up to the passenger side window, frightening [Zhu Lin] who immediately locked the window, keeping it out. However, the cunning wolf circled around to the other side of the car, pried open the rear window, and reached its claws directly towards [Zhu Guangsheng].
1:27:39|1:27:48|Due to wearing thick clothes, only [Zhu Guangsheng], who managed to tear his jacket, narrowly escaped its sharp claws. Still shaken, [Zhu Guangsheng] quickly rolled up the car window and said,
1:27:52|1:28:3|The commando [Lan Bo] used all his strength to bite the wolf tightly, [Zhu Guangsheng], who was focused on [Lan Bo], did not notice the wolf crouching by the window. The gunshot startled [Zhu Guangsheng], making him shiver.
1:28:13|1:28:21|[Zhang Biao] immediately aimed at the wolf pack with one shot each. Shocked, [Zhu Guangsheng] observed [Zhang Biao] through the rearview mirror, and soon all the wolves were shot dead by [Zhang Biao].
1:28:21|1:28:32|After a fierce battle, the scene was in a mess, with bodies lying everywhere. Wolves and dogs were all lying in pools of blood. Sitting in the car, [Zhu Guangsheng] looked at the scene at this moment, tears welling up in his eyes.
1:28:32|1:28:59|He never expected that this group of wolves would sacrifice themselves to save him. With a furrowed brow, he held back tears, feeling reluctant to part with the wolves he had raised with his own hands. He deeply understood the unpredictability of life and the pain of loss. Closing his eyes, he slowly lowered his head in prayer for them, burying his head in his arms, unwilling to lift it up, while also consumed by deep self-blame.
1:28:59|1:29:6|On the other side, [Zhu Guangsheng]'s wife stood by the window, constantly looking outside, hoping for their safe return.
1:29:6|1:29:32|Director Liu's police car arrived shortly after, and they parked the car in an orderly manner where Zhu Guangsheng was. Concerned, Director Liu got out of the car as soon as it stopped, and he ran towards Zhu Guangsheng's direction. Other officers followed closely behind. However, Director Liu was shocked by the scene in front of Zhu Guangsheng's car. He looked at the bodies scattered all over the place and for a moment didn't know what to do. Only a few remaining wolves kept howling at him.
1:29:32|1:29:54|Upon learning that the police were coming, [Zhang Biao] immediately turned to [Zhu Cong] and said, he suddenly smiled and winked at [Zhu Cong]. At this moment, [Zhu Cong] did not understand what he meant. After [Zhang Biao] finished speaking, he turned around and shouted at the police below the mountain. [Zhang Biao] raised his gun above his head and slowly walked down the hillside.
1:29:54|1:30:18|[Zhu Cong] and [Changzi] silently followed behind him. At this moment, [Zhu Guangsheng] lifted his head in the car and sighed deeply as he looked at him. Meanwhile, Director Liu, who was standing in the crowd, immediately ordered the arrest of [Zhang Biao]. The law enforcement officers then walked cautiously towards [Zhang Biao] with their guns raised, and handcuffed him with cold handcuffs. Witnessing all this, [Zhu Guangsheng] couldn't bear to watch and tightly closed his eyes before the law enforcement officers escorted [Zhang Biao] away.
1:30:18|1:30:27|He looked reluctantly at [Zhu Cong] beside him, and [Zhu Cong], who suddenly realized, finally understood what he had just said. She wanted to step forward to stop him, but hesitated to speak.
1:30:27|1:30:32|After getting off the car, [Zhu Guangsheng] first walked to the injured [Lan Bo] and held him tightly in his arms.
1:31:44|1:31:56|At the same time, an eagle soared in the sky, overlooking the earth with powerful wings, soaring freely without constraints, as if time had gone back to the past.
1:31:56|1:32:9|[Zhu Guangsheng] stood on the hill shouting for Lanbo. As soon as Lanbo playing in the snow heard him, he would immediately run towards him. The heavy snow was falling, connecting the sky and the ground, creating a vast expanse of white where one couldn't distinguish between the sky and the ground.
1:32:9|1:32:25|Flakes of crystal white snow fell from the sky, drifting down in abundance. The snowflakes danced in the air with the rustling cold wind, resembling soft willow catkins or floating goose feathers, wandering in the vast expanse of the world.
1:32:25|1:32:36|Forester [Zhu Guangsheng]'s shocked expression upon hearing the gunshot, his sobbing while cradling Blue Wave on the snowy ground, and his final monologue at the end of the film, all signify the loss of everything.
1:32:36|1:32:53|[Zhu Guangsheng] is a general. In this battle, he defeated ten thousand enemies but lost eight thousand of his own troops. He lost his beloved general, his comrades, and what he had always wanted to protect. His heart collapsed in this moment, and nothing could be more painful for a general than this.
1:32:53|1:33:5|Zhu Guangsheng is another ordinary and insignificant general. His emotions towards this career are like his love for this snowy forest, and for the wolfhounds that follow him to the death.
