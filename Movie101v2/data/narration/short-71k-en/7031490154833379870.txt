0:1:57|0:2:0|Dong Xianzhou teaches the young [Dong Haichuan] martial arts step by step.
0:2:9|0:2:14|His martial arts are now powerful and vigorous. At this moment, he is practicing martial arts in the courtyard.
0:2:18|0:2:30|Carrying a quiver on his back and holding a bow and arrow in his hand, [Ma Dongmei] walked out of the house with a broad smile, approaching him who was practicing martial arts.
0:2:56|0:3:5|With his father Dong Xianzhou's permission, Dong Ying happily pulled [Dong Haichuan] towards the forest and successfully shot a wild rabbit.
0:3:15|0:3:28|A wealthy young master rode a horse to the woods, followed by many servants. At this moment, one of the servants spotted a girl picking mushrooms.
0:3:30|0:3:37|Upon seeing the teenage girl, the wealthy young master, along with his servant, quietly approached the girl.
0:4:0|0:4:8|The girl exerted all her strength and landed a solid slap on the face of the wealthy young master.
0:4:22|0:4:31|During the struggle, the girl's clothes were torn apart, and immediately after, her tight-fitting underwear was exposed for all to see.
0:4:31|0:4:39|[Dong Haichuan] and [Ma Dongmei] heard the cry for help and quickly ran towards the direction of the sound.
0:4:44|0:4:55|[Ma Dongchuan] was seen sweeping with a stick, causing several servants to fall to the ground. The rich young master, seeing this, released the girl and gritted his teeth as he watched this troublemaker.
0:5:0|0:5:15|The wealthy young master took the sword from [Butler Luo], walked towards [Dong Haichuan] who was fighting, before he could get close, everyone accompanying him fell to the ground and couldn't get up. The wealthy young master tried to frame [Butler Luo], but was immediately knocked down by [Dong Haichuan].
0:5:44|0:5:50|[Hu Gongzi] swung his sword, [Dong Haichuan] reacted quickly and then used a stick to push him away with a strike and a poke.
0:6:35|0:6:46|Led by the girl, [Dong Haichuan] and Dong Ying arrived at the grass hut deep in the jungle, where an old man was practicing Tai Chi with a horse stance in the courtyard.
0:6:47|0:6:53|[Dong Haichuan] was fascinated by the old man's every move. The old man's movements were smooth and flowing,
0:6:53|0:7:4|Like a fox catching a rabbit, like a cat catching a mouse, [Ma Dongmei] relaxed her whole body after receiving it in her lower abdomen, slowly loosened her knees, and turned her head to look at her granddaughter at the door.
0:8:29|0:8:44|[Butler Luo] led several servants to look for [Dong Haichuan]'s whereabouts. It started to rain heavily outside. At this moment, [Dong Haichuan] and two others were carrying a wild rabbit they had hunted, preparing to sell it to a tavern. Coincidentally, this scene was seen by [Butler Luo] who happened to pass by.
0:8:44|0:8:50|He carefully identified him and, after confirming that it was [Dong Haichuan], hurriedly ran back to the mansion.
0:10:28|0:10:37|[Butler Luo]'s words temporarily calmed [Mr. Hu]'s mood. In the peaceful life, [Xuelian] embroidered a handkerchief with flowers for [Dong Haichuan].
0:10:48|0:10:52|[Xuelian] avoided [Dong Haichuan]'s intense gaze and smiled awkwardly.
0:11:25|0:11:35|The simple conversation between the master and disciple at night not only resolved the long-standing concerns of the master, but also brought [Dong Haichuan] and [Xuelian] closer together.
0:11:35|0:11:41|One morning, [Dong Haichuan] held [Xuelian]'s hand and arrived at a waterfall in the deep forest.
0:11:41|0:11:48|Two people admired the majestic waterfall, gazing affectionately at each other, gradually leaning towards each other.
0:11:48|0:12:6|[Xuelian] leaned shyly against [Dong Haichuan]'s chest, and at this moment, [Dong Haichuan] felt like he had the whole world. He was already deeply in love with [Xuelian]. They played and frolicked together by the mountain stream, with sounds of happiness and laughter filling the air.
0:12:6|0:12:13|In the valley, two people only have each other in their eyes. Time passes day by day.
0:12:13|0:12:19|[Dong Haichuan] practices Tai Chi diligently with his master while enjoying sweet moments with [Xuelian].
0:12:19|0:12:28|One night, the master had another conversation with [Dong Haichuan] in the courtyard. He walked and talked at the same time, with [Dong Haichuan] following behind him.
0:14:57|0:15:5|Inside the house, [Xuelian] saw this scene, feeling particularly conflicted in her heart.
0:15:26|0:15:34|The butler brought back three martial arts masters from the capital city to the courtyard, who then demonstrated their extraordinary martial arts skills one by one.
0:15:34|0:15:47|First up is the Flying Dagger God [Li Jie], who performs several backflips in a row, then swiftly throws several short daggers from the sheath on his thigh, firmly embedding them into the trees in the courtyard.
0:15:47|0:15:58|Madam Wu nodded approvingly when she saw it, and then Meteor Swordsman Yun also displayed his unique skill, swinging an iron whip at a tree stump.
0:15:58|0:16:6|In an instant, a large hole was punched into the tree stump. Then, [Dong Haichuan] wielded his unique weapon.
0:16:6|0:16:14|After spinning rapidly, the table used for the ritual in the courtyard is chopped in half.
0:16:21|0:16:24|[Mrs. Hu] and her son smiled at each other with satisfaction.
0:16:24|0:16:36|In the martial arts school, [Dong Haichuan] still practices diligently every day, the habit since childhood deeply ingrained in his bones, beads of sweat covering his forehead with bulging veins.
0:16:36|0:16:51|The next day, many people came to the Mingyang Martial Arts Hall, with major sects gathering together to learn from each other and improve their martial arts skills. The leaders of the major sects sat in the front row, and then the disciples of the Mingyang Martial Arts Hall began to demonstrate their martial arts.
0:16:57|0:17:3|The display of martial arts skills by the disciples made [Dong Haichuan] very pleased, a smile involuntarily appeared on his lips.
0:17:3|0:17:8|They walked steadily and firmly, with powerful and forceful punches.
0:17:8|0:17:15|The Grand Master of Nanshaolin, [Master Kongzhi], couldn't help but secretly admire. The disciple of former boxing champion Master Lin also refused to show weakness.
0:17:15|0:17:26|The character's claws were fierce, resembling a black tiger extracting the heart, with violent and rapid movements. After a series of punches from left to right, he lifted his left leg, the sole of his foot straight as if standing like a golden rooster.
0:17:26|0:17:29|The disciples of Shaolin Temple also showed off their martial arts skills.
0:17:29|0:17:39|In the courtyard, everything was observed by [Butler Luo] who was peeping from outside. He tugged at the beard on his chin, secretly calculating something in his mind.
0:17:39|0:17:45|After the competition, [Dong Haichuan] and several fellow martial arts brothers went to a restaurant to have a few drinks.
0:17:54|0:17:59|At this moment, [Master Hu] arrived at the restaurant with several martial arts experts from the capital city.
0:18:19|0:18:33|Who would have expected that three martial arts masters from the capital city have already flown to the second floor. The throwing knife god Li Jie took the lead, [Dong Haichuan] quick-wittedly dodged the dagger that came towards him, and quickly engaged in combat with Li Jie, who was dining with his fellow brothers at the same table.
0:18:33|0:18:41|The Meteor Knight Xiangyun also used the iron whip to swing towards [Dong Haichuan], but [Dong Haichuan] dodged it and it hit the dining table.
0:18:41|0:18:48|[Dong Haichuan] seized the opportunity, stepping on his iron whip and then seizing the whip to wrap it around his neck.
0:18:50|0:18:56|[Dong Haichuan] immediately understood when he saw [Master Hu].
0:19:7|0:19:14|[Dong Haichuan] pushes the popular weird hero down onto the table.
0:19:17|0:19:22|The innkeeper sensed trouble and quickly had the waiter inform [Dong Xianzhou].
0:19:22|0:19:31|[Dong Haichuan] and his two senior brothers were facing off against the servants wielding long swords. The solid and steady kung fu they had practiced daily was now being put to good use.
0:19:31|0:19:55|In no time, the servants fell to the ground one after another. Another group of servants wielding long swords rushed forward. [Dong Haichuan] fought bare-handed, striking fiercely and swiftly at the oncoming attackers. He kicked one servant into the air and continued to pummel the others. Midway through the fight, he noticed [Master Hu] sitting on the side, preparing to drink tea, and a plan formed in his mind.
0:19:58|0:20:15|Before it could be delivered to his mouth, the full cup of tea spilled on [Mr. Hu]'s face. [Mr. Hu] protected his head but not his stomach, and took a solid punch from [Dong Haichuan].
0:20:20|0:20:30|Seeing that Mingyang Martial Arts School brought a group of disciples, the steward advised [Mr. Hu] to retreat. Shortly after, the servants supported each other and left.
0:21:57|0:22:4|Upon returning to the room, [Dong Haichuan] held the handkerchief embroidered by [Xuelian] in his hands, gently caressing the embroidery on it.
0:22:4|0:22:10|A gentle smile appeared at the corner of the mouth. A group of black-clothed people suddenly appeared outside the door.
0:22:10|0:22:16|The arrivals were all dressed in night clothes, but it was still recognizable that they were the men brought by [Mr. Hu].
0:22:16|0:22:30|They split up, with one group of people moving stealthily from the eaves, while another group vaulted over the fence into the courtyard. Their movements were agile and nimble, the steward and three martial arts experts waiting outside the fence.
0:22:30|0:22:35|The people in the courtyard held long swords, gently pushed open the door, and tiptoed into the room.
0:22:35|0:22:45|After a moment, there was a strange noise in the room, and one by one, the people in night clothes began to scream in horror.
0:22:45|0:22:52|Following that, [Dong Haichuan]'s master and [Xuelian] walked out of the house and saw their men lying on the ground.
0:22:52|0:23:0|[Mr. Hu] dismounted and walked into the courtyard.
0:23:1|0:23:3|Grandpa gestured for [Xuelian] to come into the house to take cover.
0:23:3|0:23:22|Following that, a person in night clothes brandished a knife and approached. [Xuelian] stood close to the door, paying close attention to everything happening in the courtyard. Grandpa acted decisively, with agile wrists, knocking down one person with a palm strike, and skillfully avoiding the swords of the three experts from the capital city.
0:23:22|0:23:26|The character [Ma Dongmei] is at a loss and takes a blow to the abdomen from the popular eccentric hero Xiang Yun.
0:23:35|0:23:45|She called out to her grandfather, [Master Hu] approached, and [Xuelian] tried to fight back, but was knocked unconscious from behind.
0:23:45|0:23:55|The servant lifted the unconscious [Xuelian] and placed her on the back of [Master Hu], then the group left directly, leaving behind the grandfather whose fate was unknown in the courtyard.
0:23:55|0:24:17|As the night fell, [Dong Haichuan] arrived at the cabin in the mountains. Seeing no one answering, he walked closer and saw a mess in the courtyard. Anxiously, he walked into the courtyard and saw his master lying on the ground.
0:24:50|0:24:56|[Dong Haichuan] cried over his deceased master.
0:25:5|0:25:29|[Dong Haichuan] finally found the murderer of his master, tears filling his eyes. Seeing [Xuelian] on the horse, he became even more furious. He held his breath, clenched his fists silently, veins bulging on his face, and kicked towards [Master Hu] on the horse.
0:25:44|0:25:50|[Xuelian] gradually regained consciousness, and [Dong Haichuan] quickly launched an attack, engaging in a fierce battle with the person rushing towards him with a knife.
0:25:50|0:26:10|Seeing the expert from the capital appear again, [Xuelian] couldn't help but feel afraid, but [Dong Haichuan] was skilled enough to throw him several meters away, then he approached the shoulder of the mysterious swordsman Xingyun with a sword, and then slashed his neck.
0:26:11|0:26:37|[Dong Haichuan] pulled [Xuelian] and ran forward continuously, trying to escape from the clutches of [Mr. Hu]. However, things did not go as planned. They ran to a waterfall, with a deep abyss below. [Mr. Hu]'s men quickly caught up, and the two found themselves in a dilemma. With two fists against four hands, [Dong Haichuan] was also starting to panic.
0:26:51|0:26:58|[Xuelian] couldn't help but grab [Dong Haichuan]'s arm. Upon seeing this, [Mr. Hu] and the others laughed unabashedly.
0:27:0|0:27:16|[Dong Haichuan] saw his beloved woman being mocked, anger once again filled his mind. He took his sword and fought forward, killing several lackeys under [Mr. Hu], and then fought against Peng Fei of the Eight Night Walkers.
0:27:16|0:27:22|The legendary assassin Li Jie sensed danger and reached for the sheath at his waist.
0:27:22|0:27:39|[Dong Haichuan] was quick and agile, swiftly dodging the dagger and stabbing a person next to him in the stomach with a knife. [Master Hu] couldn't help but feel scared, so he urged the steward to catch [Xuelian] in an attempt to threaten [Dong Haichuan].
0:28:4|0:28:17|[Xuelian] took advantage of the butler's inattention, quietly reached behind her waist, quickly pulled out the dagger hidden in advance, stabbed the butler, and then turned the blade towards herself.
0:28:25|0:28:29|[Dong Haichuan] was firmly pressed to the ground by two servants.
0:28:29|0:28:34|The two servants slowly let go of each other's hands.
0:28:34|0:28:40|[Dong Haichuan] was half doubtful, but still slowly got up and hugged.
0:28:41|0:28:56|The legendary assassin Li Jie made another move, [Xuelian] blocked the flying blades for [Dong Haichuan], her body uncontrollably took a few steps back, [Dong Haichuan] quickly grabbed her.
0:29:15|0:29:24|[Xuelian] gradually lost strength and let go of her hand.
0:29:42|0:29:48|Saying that, [Dong Haichuan] grabbed [Master Hu]'s collar and threw him towards the cliff behind him.
0:29:57|0:30:8|Under the cliff is a deep pool, [Dong Haichuan] quickly regained consciousness after falling down. After swimming to the shallow water area, [Dong Haichuan] floundered for a few moments before standing firmly in the water.
0:30:8|0:30:15|He looked around at the surroundings, ignoring the pain in his body, and turned his body in the water, searching for the figure of [Xuelian].
0:30:17|0:30:22|He kept calling out helplessly,
0:30:43|0:30:56|His loud voice echoed for a long time, resounding through the valley. He wished so much for a voice to respond to him, but there was none.
0:30:56|0:31:5|He helplessly slapped the water, when suddenly, a stone by the pool caught his attention. Beside the stone lay a jade pendant, and the owner of the jade pendant was none other than [Xuelian].
0:31:31|0:31:38|[Mrs. Hu Huihui] couldn't accept the fact that her son fell off the cliff, and in a fit of anger, she fainted.
0:32:0|0:32:6|[Dong Haichuan] returned from the cliff and buried his master in the ground, then kowtowed three times in front of his master's grave.
0:32:6|0:32:15|Accompanying [Dong Haichuan] on the journey were various martial artists from the Jianghu world, including the abbot of Shaolin Temple, Master Du.
0:32:15|0:32:20|Everyone's faces were solemn, bending down to bow in mourning, expressing their condolences.
0:32:20|0:32:32|[Dong Haichuan] stood up after knocking his head, wiped away the tears from the corners of his eyes, stared blankly at the tombstone, and let out a long sigh. He didn't know what to do.
0:32:32|0:32:37|The master has died, and the whereabouts of the beloved [Xuelian] are also unknown.
0:32:37|0:32:45|[Dong Xianzhou] looked at him in a daze, gently patting his shoulder, and then he came to his senses.
0:34:37|0:34:51|After the Kung Fu master finished speaking with disappointment, [Dong Haichuan] nodded and turned to him.
0:35:49|0:35:56|[Mr. Hu] is currently frolicking with a courtesan in the room, with smoke filling the air.
0:36:3|0:36:11|The woman pinched Mr. Hu's thigh hard, but Mr. Hu did not blame her.
0:36:27|0:36:41|[Mr. Hu] quickly chased away the two courtesans beside him, hid the big opium pipe and kerosene lamp on the table, then stood up to straighten his messy clothes. He waved his hand in the air a few times, trying to cover up the smell of opium in the air.
0:37:24|0:37:31|Mr. Hu, who has lost his beloved son, is now filled with hatred towards Mr. Dong Haichuan.
0:38:31|0:38:36|Before leaving, Mr. Hu handed a large silver note to [Prince Xiao].
0:38:36|0:38:43|[Prince Xiao] put down the tea in his hand when he saw the situation, but a smile appeared on his face. On the other side, [Dong Haichuan],
0:38:43|0:38:59|Under the guidance of [Master Biyun], he diligently practiced day and night, focusing his mind during practice, with swift offense and defense, versatile techniques, clear and powerful boxing skills, and explosive energy.
0:38:59|0:39:14|Between the expansion and contraction of his movements, there is a continuous flow. He remains calm and collected, attempting to perfect every action. His footwork complements his boxing, steady and methodical, proceeding with determination and perseverance.
0:39:14|0:39:29|Years have passed in the blink of an eye, and [Dong Haichuan] has matured from a young man to a more experienced individual. His martial arts skills have also improved significantly, with immense arm strength and swift and powerful movements, delivering powerful kicks.
0:39:29|0:39:37|A fist technique danced without a gap. Trained in martial arts since childhood, mixed with the essence of various martial arts schools.
0:39:37|0:39:54|His boxing style is versatile, dazzling, with intricate long movements combined with powerful palm strikes. Each move is closely connected, as if multiple arms are striking together, appearing extremely fierce.
0:39:54|0:40:3|The Shaolin Diamond Fist was practiced to perfection in his punches and kicks, and the fulfillment of his master's wish to become a grandmaster was just around the corner.
0:40:3|0:40:10|One night, [Master Biyun] and [Dong Haichuan] were strolling around the temple. [Master Biyun] said to [Dong Haichuan].
0:41:25|0:41:33|[Dong Haichuan] carefully calculated the years.
0:42:13|0:42:19|Seeing the master insisting like this, there was nothing more to say.
0:42:19|0:42:25|Reluctantly, [Ma Dongmei] took one last look at her master before shouldering her luggage and walking down the mountain.
0:42:25|0:42:32|[Dong Haichuan] at this time also left the Shaolin Temple where he had been practicing for 10 years with his luggage on his back.
0:42:35|0:42:42|After coming down the mountain, he passed by a tavern on the street and walked in.
0:43:18|0:43:33|Upon hearing the cold sarcasm from [Dong Haichuan], [Princess Ziyun] swung her unsheathed sword towards him, but ultimately her skills were no match for him, and she was forced back by a palm strike from [Dong Haichuan].
0:43:38|0:44:0|After a simple meal, [Dong Haichuan] walked non-stop to a deep mountain where a Taoist temple was located. The stone lions at the entrance were covered with moss, and a young Taoist was sweeping the fallen leaves in front of the gate.
0:44:15|0:44:20|[Dong Haichuan] finished speaking, and the young Taoist priest immediately made his move, not yet approaching.
0:44:20|0:44:27|[Ma Dongmei] was pushed several meters away by [Dong Haichuan]. [Dong Haichuan] walked towards the Taoist temple, but the young Taoist was still unwilling to give up.
0:44:27|0:44:32|[Ma Dongmei] tried to block him with her legs, but [Dong Haichuan] easily threw him several meters away.
0:44:36|0:44:45|This finally made the young Taoist submit willingly,
0:44:58|0:45:11|At this moment, a woman suddenly rushed out from behind, [Dong Haichuan] exchanged a few simple moves with her. [Master Biyun] walked out from the audience.
0:45:43|0:46:4|[Taoist Biyun] soared into the air, leaped down from a tall building with one hand behind his back, swiftly striking out with his palm. [Dong Haichuan] struggled to resist as [Taoist Biyun] changed his footwork, moving behind [Dong Haichuan] and delivering a direct blow to his back.
0:46:24|0:46:30|[Princess Ziyun] came down the mountain and returned home.
0:50:10|0:50:29|The scene is quiet inside the temple, [Master Biyun] is practicing in the courtyard. His arms are in a hugging-the-moon posture, held in front of his chest in a circular shape. His whole body is squatting in a four-cornered non-sitting position, eyes closed to rest his spirit, motionless. It is evident that he has reached the state of unity of body and mind.
0:50:29|0:50:37|[Dong Haichuan] found [Master Biyun], and after watching his movements, he walked up to him and started following along.
0:50:37|0:50:43|[Taoist Biyun] noticed the movement beside him, smiled knowingly, and slowly raised his eyes.
0:50:43|0:50:51|Seeing that the person next to him was indeed as he had expected, he put down his hands in front of him and stood up.
0:51:3|0:51:12|In his dream, [Dong Haichuan] dreamed of an old man with a white beard, sitting cross-legged in the Bagua formation, focusing his mind and holding his breath.
0:51:44|0:51:49|Continuously recalling the moves of the Eight Trigram Palm in his mind.
0:51:49|0:51:56|The next day, she practiced repeatedly, without the slightest slack. Unstoppable.
0:51:56|0:52:11|In addition to being naturally intelligent, [Dong Haichuan] has now reached the pinnacle of his skills, with astonishing palm strength, able to split a stool in half with his bare hands.
0:52:30|0:52:33|[Dong Haichuan] just watched her silently without responding.
0:53:19|0:53:30|At this moment, wails echoed on the stone steps outside the Taoist temple. Led by [Princess Ziyun], the group had arrived, and [Dong Haichuan] was wielding his sword, engaging in a fierce battle with the oncoming attackers.
0:53:30|0:53:46|The person who approached [Dong Haichuan] couldn't get close to him at all. She immediately drew her sword and stabbed towards [Dong Haichuan]. Seeing this, [Dong Haichuan] used his own sword to block, causing [Ziyun] to retreat repeatedly. [Yuyan] rushed out from the audience.
0:54:32|0:54:41|[Princess Yuyan] followed [Fourth Prince] as they left the Taoist temple.
0:54:47|0:54:55|[Taoist Biyun] gave a set of iron weapons to [Dong Haichuan].
0:55:48|0:56:7|[Master Bikong] finished explaining and turned to enter the temple. [Dong Haichuan] left the mountain, while [Princess Yuyan] and [Fourth Prince] rode their horses down the mountain. In the woods, a group of bandits were hiding, about ten of them, each holding a long knife, carefully watching the situation at the foot of the slope.
0:56:7|0:56:25|After the target appeared, more than 10 people swarmed down towards [Fourth Prince] and [Princess Yuyan]. [Princess Yuyan] was very alert, and she noticed the strange noise as soon as it came out, but it was already too late. The bandits, numerous in number, quickly blocked their way.
0:56:25|0:56:39|The leader of the bandits walked to the front from behind his men, glanced at Princess Yuyan sitting on the horse, and arrogantly made unreasonable demands to the Fourth Prince, who ignored him.
0:56:39|0:56:45|[Yuyan Princess] was at a loss for a moment, as the bandit reached out his hand directly to try to snatch it by force.
0:56:45|0:56:53|However, following closely behind, [Dong Haichuan] saw this scene and quickly dismounted, rushing forward to kick the bandit's hand away.
0:56:53|0:57:7|[Yuyan Princess] immediately dismounted and started fighting the bandits with her sword. [Dong Haichuan] knocked down several bandits with his bare hands, then kicked the leader of the bandits in the chest with precision.
0:57:7|0:57:12|Only hearing the bandit leader let out a miserable cry, a stream of blood gushed from his mouth.
0:57:12|0:57:19|[Dong Haichuan] grabbed his collar and lifted him up from the ground, following [Fourth Prince] to the county town of Wen'an.
0:57:51|0:58:0|The scene was spotted by [Steward Luo], who often dines at the restaurant, as he carefully observed [Dong Haichuan] in the distance.
0:59:37|0:59:41|[Dong Haichuan] raised his wine glass, when suddenly the waiter from the restaurant came over to them.
0:59:55|1:0:0|The butler [Luo] nearby glanced at the rising [Dong Haichuan] with hidden joy in his heart.
1:0:17|1:0:27|[Steward Luo] got up and left the restaurant, then arrived at the county magistrate's mansion.
1:0:47|1:0:56|The county magistrate took the official document from [Steward Luo] and carefully read it.
1:2:28|1:2:37|[Steward Luo] leaned close to the county magistrate and whispered a few words in his ear.
1:3:46|1:3:57|[Dong Haichuan] pressed down the leader of the bandits and, accompanied by several bailiffs, arrived at the prison.
1:5:10|1:5:34|[Fourth Prince] ignored it and turned his head to think of a solution, while [Dong Haichuan] was already in prison clothes and taken to the court. The county magistrate put away his folding fan, clapped the gavel, and picked up the official documents from the Ministry of Justice.
1:5:52|1:6:5|The magistrate dropped the command arrow in his hand, signaling the executioner to start the execution. The executioner dropped the death warrant behind [Ma Dongmei]. Upon seeing this scene, [Mr. Luo] knew that the scheme had succeeded, and he left the execution ground with a smile on his face.
1:6:5|1:6:19|The executioner handed a bowl of wine to [Dong Haichuan], but he disdainfully turned his head away. Seeing this, the executioner put down the bowl, picked up the knife, and gestured twice at his neck. [Dong Haichuan] closed his eyes, raised his head, and waited for death to come.
1:6:20|1:6:24|Upon hearing these three words, the county magistrate immediately stood up, brushed his sleeves, and knelt down.
1:6:30|1:6:38|[Fourth Prince] arrived at the execution ground holding the imperial decree given to him by the emperor, followed closely by several imperial guards with swords.
1:7:17|1:7:34|In a street corner, a street performer is swinging his fists, surrounded by a crowd of onlookers. His punches are powerful, his moves are unpredictable and swift, and in no time he wins applause from the spectators. A Chinese man with his queue cut off says to the foreigner next to him.
1:7:37|1:7:41|The two walked towards the direction of the sound and saw a person showing off his martial arts skills.
1:7:51|1:7:58|The person who cut off the braids rudely pushed aside the onlookers in front of him, leaving a gap. He asked the foreigner to step into the circle. The foreigner walked forward and grabbed the man's arm.
1:8:24|1:8:41|The foreigner and the street performer locked eyes for a moment, then the foreigner made the first move. He swung his left leg out tentatively, followed by his right leg, and then flipped his body in the air a few times before landing a kick on the street performer's chest. The street performer was unable to defend himself and fell into the crowd.
1:8:54|1:8:59|The foreigner overstepped his bounds, reached out to harass [Ziyun], but was slapped by [Ziyun].
1:8:59|1:9:6|This completely angered the foreigner, and at that moment, [Dong Haichuan] appeared out of nowhere and pushed the foreigner back with one palm.
1:9:6|1:9:14|After the foreigner regained consciousness, he lifted his leg and kicked towards [Dong Haichuan]. However, [Dong Haichuan] quickly grabbed his leg and the foreigner fell backwards onto the ground.
1:10:48|1:11:8|[Sha Huihui]'s martial arts challenge has not received a response. The people on the field looked at each other, and after a while, finally, one person stood up. However, before getting close, he was kicked down by [Sha Huihui].
1:11:8|1:11:20|The person leaped into the air with the tips of their toes, but was knocked down by a kick from [Sha Huihui] as he turned around.
1:11:20|1:11:29|On the field, anyone who is dissatisfied is knocked down by [Sha Huihui], and no one dares to step forward to challenge him.
1:11:44|1:11:59|Upon receiving the order from [Fourth Prince], [Dong Haichuan] stood up from his seat. Although his demeanor was clever, he revealed a disturbing sharpness. [Sha Huihui] did not pay any attention to him, staring at him fiercely.
1:11:59|1:12:7|The two people stood back to back, looking at each other, even though it hasn't officially started, the tension is already palpable.
1:12:7|1:12:13|After a few rounds of eye contact battle, [Sha Huihui] could no longer hold back and began to speak first.
1:12:14|1:12:21|After speaking, he suddenly twisted his waist to the right and, with his arms slightly open, officially challenged [Dong Haichuan].
1:12:21|1:12:29|[Dong Haichuan] smiled slightly at the corner of his mouth as [Sha Huihui] charged forward and executed a sweeping leg kick. [Dong Haichuan] quickly bent down and dodged the attack.
1:12:29|1:12:35|[Sha Huihui] advances step by step, soaring into the air and spinning rapidly several times, then kicks towards [Dong Haichuan].
1:12:35|1:12:45|[Dong Haichuan] ate a kick in silence, then decided to launch an attack. He withdrew his left foot, spun with his right foot, blocked with his right arm, struck with his left arm, quickly lowered his chassis, and swiftly passed with his right arm.
1:12:45|1:12:56|[Sha Huihui] saw the situation turning unfavorable and kept evading, using both hands and feet to climb up the high wall inside the hall like a gecko. However, her face still showed a strong killing intent, her gaze as sharp as a blade.
1:12:56|1:13:7|Staring angrily at [Dong Haichuan], then gathering strength, releasing the hands grabbing the wall, bending down and rushing down, approaching the below [Dong Haichuan]. [Dong Haichuan] slightly sidestepped.
1:13:7|1:13:18|Dodging the punches of [Sha Huihui], [Sha Huihui] becomes even more furious. However, after flipping over, [Dong Haichuan] creates distance between them and both of them extend their palms.
1:13:18|1:13:22|Filled with anger in their hearts, [Sha Huihui] once again launched a powerful attack.
1:13:22|1:13:31|[Dong Haichuan] faces the enemy head-on, flipping his palm out, raising his arm to block, turning with a wrong step, then left to meet and right to block, changing his moves and dodging a strike.
1:13:31|1:13:39|[Sha Huihui] was extremely cunning and domineering, pressing hard with every move. [Dong Haichuan] halted his steps, seized the opportunity, and delivered a heavy blow to his waist.
1:13:41|1:13:46|The lady watching on the side couldn't help but sigh at this palm strike, [Dong Haichuan] stood up and withdrew his momentum.
1:13:47|1:13:51|Sha Huizheng remained silent, clutching his waist in pain and glaring at [Dong Haichuan].
1:14:1|1:14:9|Seeing that [Prince Xiao] looked uneasy, [Fourth Prince] quickly asked.
1:14:56|1:15:3|[Fourth Prince]'s eyes lit up instantly.
1:15:8|1:15:16|[Prince Xiao] stood up and walked towards [Dong Haichuan].
1:16:15|1:16:22|Upon witnessing the way [Prince Xiao] treated him, Sha Huizheng snorted coldly and left with his own wife.
1:16:22|1:16:29|[Princess Ziyun] also pouted, very puzzled by the reason for her father's actions.
1:18:20|1:18:29|Late at night, in the idle [Xiao Wang Mansion], [Dong Haichuan] remembered his former lover. Holding the jade pendant of [Xuelian] in his hand, he felt a wave of bitterness in his heart.
1:18:29|1:18:34|Thinking about everything that happened under the cliff that day, feeling both self-blame and regret.
1:18:35|1:18:42|He paced slowly under the pavilion late at night, and after a moment, he sat on the stone bench with a worried look on his face.
1:18:42|1:18:51|[Princess Ziyun] happened to pass by and saw [Dong Haichuan] in the pavilion, still as a statue, staring at the object in his hand. She slowly walked towards [Dong Haichuan].
1:19:8|1:19:14|[Dong Haichuan] still ignored her, still examining the jade pendant in his hand.
1:19:22|1:19:29|[Princess Ziyun] awkwardly took back her jade pendant.
1:19:48|1:19:55|The brief conversation between the two ends. The next morning, [Sha Huihui], who suffered a loss, is practicing martial arts in the courtyard.
1:19:56|1:20:15|He held the red tassel spear with his left hand in front and his right hand behind, exerting force to flip back, drawing an arc from below to the upper right side, and stably and powerfully thrusting forward. His waist, legs, wrists, arms, and the long tassel spear were integrated as one, with strength penetrating through the body like a swimming dragon.
1:20:15|1:20:25|[Dong Haichuan] saw [Sha Huihui] practicing martial arts and quickly bowed with clasped hands in respect.
1:20:50|1:21:0|[Dong Haichuan] did not respond and turned away.
1:21:0|1:21:3|[Sha Huihui] eyes were filled with unwillingness.
1:21:16|1:21:25|Since the last defeat in the martial arts competition, [Sha Huihui] has been feeling aggrieved, and today, with [Dong Haichuan]'s appearance, the anger inside him is ignited once again.
1:21:25|1:21:47|One midnight, [Dong Haichuan] was studying martial arts in the room. He held a book in one hand and gestured the moves in the book in the air with the other hand. Suddenly, a sharp sword flew towards him through the window. After dodging it, he quickly chased out and intercepted two people in night clothes.
1:21:47|1:22:1|The two ignored [Dong Haichuan] and rushed up to attack swiftly. [Dong Haichuan] quickly unveiled them, but to his surprise, the two were [Sha Huihui] and his wife.
1:22:2|1:22:10|[Dong Haichuan] gave the two of them a cold look, then turned and walked away. He never mentioned what happened that night to anyone ever again.
1:23:29|1:23:33|The nun glanced at [Princess Ziyun], stood up and looked outside the door.
1:23:55|1:24:3|After Master finished speaking, she turned and left, leaving behind a puzzled [Ziyun], but she still followed Master's instructions.
1:24:3|1:24:12|The next day, [Dong Haichuan] arrived at Xishan.
1:24:34|1:24:44|The nun walked forward, unexpectedly turned around and attacked [Dong Haichuan] with a whisk in hand. [Dong Haichuan] quickly reacted and countered the move.
1:24:44|1:24:52|The master kept pressing forward step by step, and at this moment, [Daoist Biyun] suddenly appeared.
1:25:24|1:25:31|[Taoist Biyun] extended a hand, gesturing for [Dong Haichuan] to step aside, then squatted down with a bow stance and struck out with his palm.
1:25:31|1:25:36|[Bikong Abbess] also quickly made a move, forcefully throwing the floating dust in her hand towards [Biyun Taoist].
1:25:36|1:25:42|[Taoist Biyun] dodged several times, but Master Tai's arm technique was extremely fast.
1:25:42|1:25:54|[Taoist Biyun] was forced to retreat repeatedly, seeing the situation turning unfavorable. Seizing the opportunity, [Taoist Biyun] leaped into the air using the tree stump behind him, and while airborne, kicked out his right foot towards the wrist of [Nun Bikong].
1:25:54|1:26:12|The nun, caught off guard, slid back several meters. She quickly regained her composure and the two engaged in combat once again. The sound of fists and floating dust in the air was deafening, and the fight became increasingly intense. Both sides repeatedly tested each other, unable to determine who had the upper hand.
1:26:13|1:26:22|After speaking, [Master Biyun] wrapped the floating dust in [Master Bikong]'s hand around his arm, dragging her arm backwards like a swift arrow for about 10 meters.
1:26:22|1:26:29|The right foot swiftly kicks [Bixiao Master]'s scapula, [Bixiao Master] shows no weakness, swinging the floating dust in her hand.
1:26:29|1:26:40|Every time she went towards [Master Biyun]'s vital point. However, the situation was difficult to reverse, [Master Biyun] exerted all his strength to break the floating dust with one palm, and then slapped her against a tree with the other hand.
1:26:40|1:26:49|[Elder Bikong] hit her waist against the tree, let out a miserable cry, and then fell to the ground, spitting blood and unable to get up.
1:28:46|1:28:56|After listening to the words of [Master Biyun], [Princess Ziyun] took out her jade pendant, and [Dong Haichuan] also took out the jade pendant of [Xuelian]. The two jade pendants turned out to be identical.
1:28:56|1:29:4|[Dong Haichuan]'s eyes were filled with tears.
1:29:56|1:30:9|[Dong Haichuan] smiled knowingly and left Xishan, leaving [Ziyun] standing there with a heart in turmoil.
1:30:35|1:30:42|[Dong Haichuan] behind him heard all this, his ambitious nature revealed.
1:32:34|1:32:40|Yin Fu, wearing iron handcuffs, and [Dong Haichuan] found a clearing and stopped.
1:32:40|1:32:46|Iron Bracelet [Yin Fu] clenched his hands tightly in front of his chest, exerted a little force, and then rushed towards [Dong Haichuan].
1:32:46|1:32:53|But after just a few moves, [Dong Haichuan] struck him on the back of the head, and he fell to his knees with a thud. Refusing to accept defeat, he rolled over and looked up.
1:32:53|1:33:2|With a fierce kick, trying to bring down [Dong Haichuan], [Dong Haichuan] turns around and hangs, then both palms strike at the same time, hitting him solidly in the chest.
1:33:2|1:33:8|[After falling to the ground, [Yin Fu]'s forehead bulged with blue veins as he struggled to stand up, holding his painful chest.]
1:35:52|1:36:7|At the Huayang International Kung Fu Competition organized by the Eight-Nation Alliance, the drums and gongs by the arena were deafening, with foreign martial arts groups and talented warriors from the Qing Dynasty seated on both sides, while Emperor Xianfeng and royal ministers sat on the high platform.
1:36:7|1:36:13|A person with braids cut off, wearing Western-style clothes, walked slowly to the center of the stage.
1:36:25|1:36:44|The crowd under the stage formed a circle, with noisy voices and chaos all around. Sitting on the platform, [Prince] was full of confidence towards the Qing Dynasty generals, while only [Dong Haichuan] looked worriedly at the bare-chested Western strongman on the stage, full of provocation and disdain in his expression as he looked at the opponents about to fight.
1:36:50|1:36:54|With the sound of the gong, the competition on the stage officially begins.
1:36:54|1:37:2|The foreigner rubbed his hands in excitement, but the Qing Dynasty warrior showed no weakness, delivering a fierce punch and then kicking the foreigner in the stomach.
1:37:16|1:37:32|The foreigner raised his hands in victory and shouted, then a Qing Dynasty warrior rushed onto the stage. He displayed powerful martial arts moves with his fists and feet, causing the foreigners in the world kung fu troupe to burst into laughter.
1:37:32|1:37:36|The audience below whispered about the upcoming battle.
1:37:36|1:37:59|The sound of gongs and drums rang out again. The newly arrived Qing Dynasty military officer launched an attack, but before getting into position, he was knocked down by a foreigner. Faced with another failure, the atmosphere among the audience dropped to freezing point. [Fourth Prince] and many royal ministers showed a worried expression, while only [Prince Xiao] remained calm and composed, sitting steadily among them.
1:38:2|1:38:27|Emperor Xianfeng frowned anxiously as he looked at the audience below. Fortunately, another Qing Dynasty general stepped forward to challenge the opponent, but the opponent was too strong. After just a few moves, he was knocked down by the foreigners. Watching the generals being defeated one after another, [Dong Haichuan] could no longer sit still. He stood up straight and walked onto the stage in front of everyone's eyes.
1:38:27|1:38:32|Seeing [Dong Haichuan] take the stage, the royal minister seemed to have been injected with a shot of adrenaline.
1:38:32|1:38:40|The foreigner who was defeated by [Dong Haichuan] on the street realized the situation was not good. He knew clearly that [Dong Haichuan] was not someone to mess with.
1:38:50|1:39:2|[Dong Haichuan] and the foreigner's confrontation began. At the start, the foreigner sneered mockingly, then pressed forward step by step, with fierce punches, each move made with total disregard for his own safety.
1:39:3|1:39:14|The move may not be very exquisite, but the inherent killing intent is enough to be frightening. [Dong Haichuan] calmly responds, then leans back and throws two punches, each drawing an arc in the air.
1:39:14|1:39:24|Successive strikes were unleashed, with powerful palm winds accompanied by a shout. The foreigner staggered back instantly, to the astonishment of the crowd below.
1:39:34|1:39:37|The audience in the audience was thrilled to see this scene, applauding and cheering.
1:39:37|1:39:43|Emperor Xianfeng saw the situation turning around and the gloom on his face also lessened.
1:39:43|1:39:51|Another shirtless muscular foreign strongman enters the scene, [Dong Haichuan], facing the enemy head-on amidst the cheers of the crowd.
1:39:55|1:40:8|Having circled around the foreign strong man a few times, without understanding the opponent's tactics, [Dong Haichuan] chose to cautiously attack. Unexpectedly, while dodging backwards, he exposed a weakness and took a solid punch from the man.
1:40:8|1:40:21|Obviously, this foreigner's martial arts skills are not weak. His boxing is powerful and swift. [Dong Haichuan] seized the opportunity and struck out with a palm, countering the foreigner's previous punch. The foreigner's face became even more unsightly, but he continued to charge forward recklessly.
1:40:21|1:40:28|After several rounds of competition, [Dong Haichuan] seemed to have figured out the foreigner's palm technique. He was methodical in his offense and defense, playing it safe and steady.
1:40:28|1:40:33|Leaving clear marks on the foreigner's bare upper body, [Ma Dongmei] takes advantage of the foreigner's evasion.
1:40:33|1:40:48|[Dong Haichuan] knocked him down with one move, the foreign strong man flipped in the air to get up, furious like a bull. But before he could get close to [Dong Haichuan], he was struck by a palm on the neck, followed by another palm straight to his chin.
1:40:48|1:40:54|The burly foreigner's body soared into the air, and [Dong Haichuan] pressed him down with another palm.
1:41:8|1:41:14|The audience below is even more excited, shouting his name loudly after this battle.
1:41:14|1:41:23|[Dong Haichuan] not only lifted the people's spirits, allowing the Qing government to hold its head high, but also received a plaque personally inscribed by Emperor Xianfeng, naming him the Grandmaster of Baguazhang.
1:41:23|1:41:45|The crowd is banging gongs and drums, [Dong Haichuan]'s disciple is holding a plaque and parading through the streets, hanging the plaque on the gate of the martial arts school. The sound of gongs and drums is incessant, mixed with the crackling of firecrackers, creating a lively atmosphere. A large number of disciples gather in front of the martial arts school, lining up on both sides.
1:41:49|1:41:56|[Dong Haichuan] clasped his hands together and bowed to the disciples around him, then said something meaningful to them.
1:42:7|1:42:24|He looked at the disciples with a knowing smile. Today, he finally fulfilled Master Bai's wish, integrating various martial arts into one, creating his own Baguazhang style and becoming a martial arts grandmaster of his generation. He is also gradually promoting the martial arts of Wudang.
