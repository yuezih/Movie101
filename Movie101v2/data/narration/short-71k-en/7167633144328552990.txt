0:0:24|0:0:43|We see a hand picking up the lipstick on the table, following the movement of the camera, we see the woman in the mirror, with the lipstick in her hand applying it.
0:0:44|0:0:52|After pursing his lips, he looked at himself in the mirror, tidied up his hair and bow tie, and then smiled satisfactorily.
0:0:52|0:1:0|The bell rang, and [Ren Changxia] picked up the embroidered token and the embroidered hat on the table again. She then dressed neatly, looked at herself in the mirror, and let out a sigh.
0:1:11|0:1:21|In this scene, a little girl practicing boxing appears on the screen. She swings her arms, constantly changing her movements back and forth, with each punch and kick being powerful and vigorous.
0:1:21|0:1:23|The scene shifts, showing a group of police officers.
0:1:27|0:1:45|Before long, another boy appeared next to the little girl. The girl was crouching on the ground, while the boy leaped over smoothly, jumping to the side. In the scene, the police officers were running uniformly, followed by the powerful shouts of the children. Many children's training figures appeared in the scene.
0:1:46|0:1:55|The leading little girl was seen changing actions back and forth in front, while the other children followed behind. Their movements were neat and powerful.
0:1:55|0:2:13|On the other side, on the morning street, a group of police officers in uniform ran slowly, shouting slogans continuously. Their feet kept moving forward, while the children's training figures alternated with the police officers' running figures. The scene gradually faded away in the slogans and the orderly sound of footsteps.
0:2:14|0:2:20|When the screen lit up again, a rugged country road appeared in front of them.
0:2:20|0:2:24|The text below indicates that this is April 13, 2004 in Henan.
0:2:24|0:2:31|In the distance, a truck with its headlights on slowly approaches, then suddenly stops. The driver in the truck looks ahead and speaks.
0:2:43|0:2:54|The crowd quickly gathered together, with the criminals continuously chasing the two individuals.
0:2:54|0:3:3|The driver lay motionless on the ground, and as the scene shifted, a whistle sounded, followed by shouts from all around.
0:3:3|0:3:6|The police officers sitting in the viewing stand looked in a certain direction, chatting and laughing.
0:3:20|0:3:31|In the distance, a fierce tug-of-war competition is taking place among the crowd, with the surrounding police officers cheering them on continuously.
0:3:31|0:3:36|Police officers around are holding signs standing next to the team, the signs read "Summit Challenge Team".
0:3:36|0:3:43|At this moment, the woman from the beginning of the film appears on the screen, grabbing the gun from the police officer next to her and waving it around.
0:3:57|0:4:3|Later, [Niu Dong] ran to the tug-of-war team and grabbed the rope, shouting and pulling it backwards to cheer them on.
0:4:3|0:4:12|[Niu Dong] struggled to pull the rope, but the flag in the center of the rope gradually moved closer to the opposite side, and the teammates behind him stepped over the dividing line one by one.
0:4:12|0:4:16|Soon, cheers erupted around them, and [Niu Dong] looked around and said,
0:4:29|0:4:34|The woman is walking towards the car while patting her clothes, and she is Ren Changxia.
0:5:7|0:5:11|Ren Changxia didn't wait for Xiao Wang to finish speaking, she took out her phone from her pocket and made a call.
0:5:11|0:5:13|Beside, Xiao Wang looked helpless.
0:5:30|0:5:35|Soon after, [Liu Liangeng] hastily opened the door and got into the car. Before long, the car was driving on the highway.
0:5:48|0:5:56|After hanging up the phone, [Ren Changxia] looked out of the car window, and the scene then shifted to her home.
0:5:56|0:5:58|Ren Changxia feeds the medicine in her hand to Liu Liangeng.
0:6:6|0:6:8|Later, he wiped the water off the father's neck for him.
0:6:27|0:6:35|I'll take it. Ren Changxia then turned and picked up the phone.
0:7:48|0:7:57|Ah, after hearing the news, [Ren Changxia] in the car hung up the phone with a smile on her face, then slowly turned her head and looked out the window.
0:7:57|0:8:3|On the highway, his car was still speeding along, the friction between the tires and the ground constantly kicking up dust.
0:8:41|0:8:50|[Ren Changxia] sat in the car, suddenly seemed to remember something, then she took out an envelope, pulled out the letter inside, and read it with a serious expression.
0:8:50|0:8:53|After watching, she nodded knowingly, as if she understood something.
0:8:56|0:9:2|Then he picked up the envelope and poured it into his hand, and four bullets slowly slid out of the envelope.
0:9:2|0:9:7|[Ren Changxia] was stunned for a moment, then picked up a bullet and placed it by the window to observe carefully.
0:9:7|0:9:14|Xiao Wang saw this scene through the rearview mirror in the car and then spoke.
0:9:14|0:9:18|Ren Changxia smiled and spoke.
0:9:18|0:9:21|The car was still speeding along the highway.
0:9:21|0:9:23|Before long, Ren Changxia arrived at the scene of the incident.
0:9:41|0:9:43|Among them, [Ren Changxia], [Liu Liangeng], [Captain Qiu], and [Niu Dong] were involved.
0:10:6|0:10:10|It is known that the deceased often went to Anping Road, but usually took the main road.
0:10:17|0:10:20|Ren Changxia listened intently, then spoke thoughtfully.
0:10:41|0:10:44|Case 126, the first major case listed by the provincial department this year, has not been solved yet.
0:10:48|0:10:50|A police officer walks in.
0:11:9|0:11:12|Then the group stood up, and [Ren Changxia] spoke.
0:11:24|0:11:30|Captain Qiu watched as Ren Changxia walked past him, then stood up helplessly and followed her.
0:11:30|0:11:39|Before long, [Ren Changxia] walked to the car and was about to open the door when she saw many simple villagers standing behind the cordon not far away.
0:11:39|0:11:42|They stared blankly at the scene of the crime.
0:11:42|0:11:48|[Ren Changxia] then released the hand on the car door and slowly walked towards the villagers. When she reached the villagers, she began to speak.
0:12:14|0:12:17|The man speaking randomly turns his head and leaves with his companion.
0:12:17|0:12:22|[Ren Changxia] lowered her head and took a few more steps, pondering something.
0:12:22|0:12:36|Turning his head to [Ren Changxia], he suddenly spoke.
0:12:36|0:12:39|Captain Qiu is pulling Ren Changxia away.
0:13:32|0:13:42|Driving from the main road to the small road, according to reports from the public, many cars have been taking the small road recently. What could be the reason for this?
0:13:46|0:13:49|The people live and work in peace and contentment.
0:14:7|0:14:14|At noon, after finishing the report, Ren Changxia walked alone to the window, bowing her head in contemplation.
0:14:14|0:14:19|Then she looked out the window and memories from before came flooding back into her mind.
0:14:19|0:14:24|A man pushes open his office door and walks in, but instead of looking at him, he just stares at the map on the wall.
0:14:29|0:14:31|She continued to look at the map.
0:14:33|0:14:35|At this moment, [Niu Dong] turned around and said.
0:14:36|0:14:43|[Niu Dong] listened thoughtfully before speaking.
0:14:58|0:15:5|Then he turned and walked to the door, looking at [Ren Changxia] inside the room, and knocked on the door.
0:15:5|0:15:8|[Niu Dong] stood still after hearing it, lowered his head and smiled.
0:15:10|0:15:20|He then slowly put down his arm and walked into the room, sitting still on the chair in front of the table. However, after sitting down, he crossed his legs and started to knock the pipe slowly.
0:15:20|0:15:25|After speaking, he leaned on his chin and looked across.
0:15:25|0:15:28|[Niu Dong] chuckled after hearing it.
0:15:42|0:15:47|[Niu Dong] smiled, then lowered his head and took out something from his pocket before speaking.
0:15:54|0:15:59|[Ren Changxia] glanced at the money on the table, sneered, and said disdainfully.
0:15:59|0:16:3|Niu Dong seemed a little displeased after hearing about the small amount of money.
0:16:16|0:16:25|[Ren Changxia] randomly took out a piece of paper and placed it in front of [Niu Dong]. [Niu Dong] smiled and picked up the paper in front of him, only to find the words "Detention Certificate" written on it.
0:16:29|0:16:31|[Niu Dong] stared blankly at the detention certificate at this moment.
0:16:39|0:16:43|[Niu Dong] chuckled tirelessly after hearing it, looking across.
0:17:12|0:17:14|The police then took [Niu Dong] away.
0:17:14|0:17:17|The scene flashes back to the window, with [Ren Changxia] still standing by the window.
0:18:4|0:18:11|[Ren Changxia] slowly walked out of the courtyard, took out a tissue from her pocket, and wiped away her tears.
0:18:11|0:18:17|At this moment, [Captain Qiu] walked over.
0:18:17|0:18:21|The two then turned and walked away.
0:18:27|0:18:34|The two of them walked outside while talking, [Ren Changxia] seemed lost in thought after coming down the hall, then took out her phone and made a call.
0:19:1|0:19:9|After speaking, she watched [Captain Qiu] leave, then turned and walked away, only to hear a voice behind her.
0:19:44|0:19:47|[Ren Changxia] stood still, watching the two of them leave.
0:19:47|0:19:52|The scene suddenly shifts, showing Ren Changxia slowly walking out of the hotel and opening her phone.
0:19:52|0:19:59|Then she stood still, looking at the text message on her phone, "The 126 police forces you arranged to be transferred have been deployed."
0:20:4|0:20:11|Captain Qiu then turned around and saluted Ren Changxia.
0:20:11|0:20:15|After saluting again, [Captain Qiu] turned around and spoke.
0:20:15|0:20:21|Ren Changxia took a few steps forward, turned around, and looked at the rows of police officers in front of her before speaking slowly.
0:21:2|0:21:10|Speak, the police immediately scattered in all directions, and the scene gradually faded away.
0:21:10|0:21:13|At this moment, two police officers walked out of the telephone booth.
0:21:17|0:21:34|The figures of Ren Changxia and Liu Liangeng gradually disappeared, and the scene slowly revealed the figures of two other police officers. They passed by the two or three people sitting at the door and walked towards the inside, then they walked into the courtyard and headed towards the house.
0:21:34|0:21:42|Other police officers either just returned and stood by the police car, or walked towards the village in small groups. At this moment, the face of [Ren Changxia] gradually appeared on the screen.
0:23:6|0:23:13|[Ren Changxia] hung up the phone, looked worriedly to the side, lowered her head in thought for a moment, and then quickly walked away.
0:23:13|0:23:19|And a medium-sized van slowly appears in the scene and drives away.
0:23:19|0:23:23|In the car, Liu Liangeng is giving water to Ren Changxia, while the others are sitting in the back.
0:23:23|0:23:25|Before long, the car arrived on the highway.
0:24:11|0:24:15|The common people couldn't get compensation, so they occupied the construction site.
0:24:26|0:24:35|Immediately, [Ren Changxia] turned around and got into the car. Xiao Wang closed the car door and started the car, and the two of them quickly drove away.
0:24:35|0:24:46|On the other side, [Zheng Gang] slowly walked out of the police station, approached the police car, opened the door and sat in the passenger seat. Then he looked at the officers in the car and spoke.
0:24:46|0:24:50|The police officer immediately started the car, and the two of them then left the Zhengzhou Public Security Bureau.
0:24:54|0:25:11|On the other side, the crowd on the hillside is slowly descending, while in the distance, a car is slowly approaching. The crowd immediately starts saying, "Let's go, let's go, let's go."
0:25:42|0:25:45|[Manager Zhao] then took out his phone.
0:26:17|0:26:19|Speak up, Manager Zhao looked at everyone.
0:27:10|0:27:16|At this moment, a police car slowly drives out of the toll station on Dengfeng East Expressway, then speeds away.
0:27:16|0:27:22|On the other side, Liu Liangeng and Chen Ju stood at the entrance of the police station, looking into the distance.
0:27:22|0:27:26|A police car drove into the police station and slowly stopped in front of Ren Changxia and Liu Liangeng.
0:27:26|0:27:31|Ren Changxia and Liu Liangeng hurried forward to open the car door, while Captain Qiu got out of the car.
0:27:35|0:27:37|After speaking, the three of them turned and walked into the police station.
0:28:8|0:28:12|[Zheng Gang] stopped walking slowly after listening, raised his hand to look at his watch.
0:28:15|0:28:18|He lowered his head in thought for a moment, then spoke again.
0:28:19|0:28:22|After speaking, he looked at [Liu Liangeng] and Director Chen beside him.
0:28:31|0:28:33|The two remained silent after listening.
0:28:33|0:28:34|Captain Qiu finished speaking and turned to leave.
0:29:38|0:29:42|In the police station conference room at this moment.
0:30:5|0:30:16|Liu Liangeng finished speaking and looked at Ren Changxia. Suddenly, his phone rang. Ren Changxia glanced at him but did not speak. Then, Liu Liangeng took out his phone and gestured to Ren Changxia before turning and walking out of the meeting room.
0:30:41|0:30:45|The durian pudding in the stairwell sighed after hanging up the phone.
0:30:45|0:30:53|Later, he turned and left the stairwell, while [Ren Changxia] sat in the car, memories from before slowly surfacing in her mind.
0:31:8|0:31:14|The scene cuts back to reality, with [Ren Changxia] sitting in the car looking slightly worried.
0:31:14|0:31:20|On the other side, [Liu Liangeng] walked slowly into the police station conference room, and when [Zheng Gang] saw him come in, he spoke.
0:31:31|0:31:38|Liu Liangeng breathed a sigh of relief after hearing it, then looked at the evidence, picked up the water glass on the table and said.
0:32:0|0:32:3|After speaking, he looked at the evidence and smiled.
0:32:3|0:32:14|At the same time, on the other side of the road, a car is speeding along, then turns, slowly approaching the toll booth, and finally stops behind another car next to the toll booth.
0:32:14|0:32:17|[Ren Changxia] got off the car, putting on her police cap as she started talking.
0:34:10|0:34:19|After speaking, the two turned and left, while [Ren Changxia] took out her phone to make a call, then she walked slowly towards the car.
0:34:26|0:34:28|The scene changes, and a man walks up to another person.
0:35:0|0:35:3|The man turned his head with a look of hesitation, but quickly spoke again.
0:35:32|0:35:37|The crowd then slowly moved forward, and Uncle Ding's figure appeared among the people.
0:35:37|0:35:42|He watched as the crowd kept moving forward, then lowered his head and slowly caught up with the crowd.
0:35:42|0:35:46|The noisy crowd walked on the road, looking very spectacular.
0:35:46|0:35:52|In the other side of the living room, [Niu Dong] was on the phone with his head down, then he hung up and walked out of the room.
0:36:9|0:36:14|[Ren Changxia] hung up the phone, looked worriedly out the window, and sighed.
0:36:25|0:36:27|Ren Changxia furrowed her brow at this moment.
0:36:32|0:36:36|Niu Dong hung up the phone and looked at the two people beside him, speaking.
0:36:47|0:36:54|The scene then shifts, with the surrounding buildings constantly moving, and the control reception room slowly appearing.
0:36:54|0:36:57|Xiao Wang casually turned the corner and parked the car in front of the police station.
0:36:57|0:37:6|[Ren Changxia] opened the car door and got out. She glanced at the police station in front of her, then turned her head anxiously to the side. After closing the car door, she ran straight to the reception room door.
0:39:4|0:39:10|After speaking, the two of them walked away quickly, then ran up the stairs.
0:39:16|0:39:20|Later, Chen Ju and [Liu Liangeng] watched as [Ren Changxia] left.
0:39:20|0:39:24|[Ren Changxia] walked into the conference room and saw [Zheng Gang] standing by the window.
0:39:24|0:39:26|She saluted immediately and then spoke.
0:39:31|0:39:34|[Zheng Gang] slowly turned around to look at [Ren Changxia].
0:39:34|0:39:38|She put her hands in her pockets, sighed, and then moved on.
0:39:44|0:39:47|After speaking, he walked to the conference table and continued.
0:39:48|0:39:56|Shortly after, he sat down on the chair in front of the table, while [Ren Changxia] walked slowly into the meeting room and sat down, placing his police cap on the table.
0:39:56|0:39:58|Ren Changxia looked at him and said.
0:39:59|0:40:3|Ren Changxia on the side took out a notebook and opened it.
0:40:13|0:40:16|Zheng Ju turned and looked at him after listening.
0:40:21|0:40:29|At this moment, Chen Qun, [Liu Liangeng], and Wensheng walked to the office door and looked outside.
0:40:32|0:40:34|No valuable clues were found at 126 for now.
0:40:45|0:40:49|[Ren Changxia] turned her head in silence after hearing, and then said with the evidence.
0:40:52|0:40:57|[Ren Changxia] got up and walked to the door after hearing it. Just as she closed the door, she heard evidence being mentioned.
0:40:59|0:41:1|She then stopped what she was doing and pushed open the door.
0:41:6|0:41:13|Then, he walked slowly to the seat and sat down, [Zheng Gang] looked at him sitting down, standing upright and speaking.
0:41:37|0:41:41|Ren Changxia glanced casually elsewhere.
0:42:14|0:42:21|Outside the office door, Chen Ju and the others looked slightly worried, then [Liu Liangeng] turned around and paced back and forth in the office.
0:42:21|0:42:24|Chen Ju also turned and walked into the office, continuing to look outside.
0:42:25|0:42:34|Before long, [Liu Liangeng] walked up to [Chen Ju], looked outside, took out his phone, and then wrote something with a stylus on the screen.
0:42:34|0:42:43|Chen Ju turned to look at her, at this moment in the meeting room.
0:42:43|0:42:51|[Ren Changxia] took out her phone, unlocked it, and then she saw a text message on her phone. She realized her mistake and apologized first before speaking.
0:43:45|0:43:51|Ren Changxia listened and then turned her head, crying.
0:43:51|0:43:57|Chen Ju sighed after listening, only to see Durian Soup take out his phone again and write something with a stylus pen on the touchscreen.
0:44:6|0:44:12|The meeting room was silent at this moment, with only the sound of Ren Changxia's heavy breathing.
0:44:12|0:44:19|He stood up, walked to the door and closed it, then turned to look at Ren Changxia who was still crying, and slowly walked over to her.
0:45:35|0:45:40|After presenting the evidence, [Ren Changxia] stood up straight, looked ahead thoughtfully, and began to speak.
0:45:42|0:45:47|[Ren Changxia] immediately lowered her head to search for the photo, and then handed the photo to the evidence.
0:45:47|0:45:48|The evidence was handed over with a photo.
0:45:49|0:45:56|Bending over, he placed the photo down.
0:46:5|0:46:9|Then, he looked at [Ren Changxia] and placed his hand on her shoulder.
0:46:9|0:46:11|[Ren Changxia] wiped away her tears and lowered her head.
0:46:25|0:46:27|[Ren Changxia] quickly stood up.
0:46:28|0:46:30|Chen Ju stood outside the door, but didn't speak.
0:46:39|0:46:45|At this moment, there was a commotion downstairs. [Ren Changxia] hurried to the window, with Zheng Jiu following closely behind her.
0:46:45|0:46:48|Outside the police station door, a large group of people slowly walked in.
0:46:52|0:46:57|[Ren Changxia] finished speaking and then turned to leave, while [Zheng Gang] remained standing by the window, watching the crowd outside.
0:46:57|0:47:9|Before long, [Ren Changxia] ran downstairs. She glanced at the crowd around her and then spoke.
0:47:9|0:47:18|In the crowd, a banner slowly rises, printed with the words: "[Ren Changxia], you've worked hard."
0:47:48|0:47:56|Ren Changxia said tearfully.
0:47:56|0:48:3|[Ren Changxia] looked at the villagers in front of her with emotion, while [Captain Qiu] was standing in the meeting room, taking everything in.
0:48:3|0:48:6|The villagers downstairs are putting a headscarf on [Ren Changxia].
0:48:13|0:48:18|The crowd then burst into applause, with laughter and cheers filling the air, and Uncle Ding also smiled among the crowd.
0:48:20|0:48:26|[Ren Changxia] bowed to everyone while speaking, then stood up and smiled at the crowd.
0:48:26|0:48:30|At this moment, Ren Changxia was smiling and turning away from the window in the meeting room.
0:48:30|0:48:38|At the same time, the villagers downstairs surrounded [Ren Changxia] expressing their gratitude continuously, then they turned around and slowly left.
0:48:38|0:48:43|[Ren Changxia] looked at the villagers with a smile on her face, responding to them as she bid them farewell.
0:48:47|0:48:54|[Ren Changxia] kept waving her arms, smiling as she watched the figures of the crowd.
0:48:54|0:49:2|After speaking, she watched the villagers walk away, slowly took off her headscarf, still waving her arms and smiling to bid farewell to the villagers.
0:49:2|0:49:6|Then, [Ren Changxia] lowered her head and looked at the handkerchief in her hand, lost in thought.
0:49:6|0:49:13|At this moment, a police car slowly came to a stop beside her, and she quickly approached.
0:49:13|0:49:15|[Ren Changxia] glanced at the headscarf in her hand.
0:49:21|0:49:24|After speaking, Zheng Gang's car slowly drove away.
0:49:24|0:49:32|[Ren Changxia] stood still watching [Zheng Gang] leave, her expression solemn as she let out a sigh, then the scene shifted to the meeting room in the police station.
0:49:41|0:49:45|After speaking, he looked at Chen Ju and the durian soup.
0:50:9|0:50:11|Ren Changxia turned to Liu Liangeng, looking at Zheng Gang who was speaking.
0:50:49|0:50:55|The scene then shifts to a desolate road, surrounded by nothing but a few withered trees and mounds of soil.
0:50:55|0:51:0|At this moment, several cars are approaching from a distance, raising a cloud of dust on the road.
0:51:0|0:51:6|Before long, the cars surrounding them slowly came to a stop, with the other vehicles also remaining in place.
0:51:6|0:51:12|Ren Changxia got off the car, turned around and looked back. At this moment, the others in the car also got off and walked towards her.
0:51:12|0:51:34|[Zheng Gang] gestured to interrupt Chen Ju, while [Ren Changxia] immediately opened the door and got into the car. The car quickly drove away, soon reaching a road lined with dead trees on both sides. The speeding car continuously kicked up dust on the road, with a little dog behind the car barking incessantly as it chased after the vehicle.
0:51:34|0:51:37|Soon after, Ren Changxia became exhausted and ran towards another direction.
0:51:37|0:51:46|The scene then shifts, and we see [Ren Changxia] walking slowly with something in her hands. Suddenly, her phone rings as she reaches the front door of a house.
0:52:20|0:52:31|The young lady, you are so busy. The old lady drags [Ren Changxia] into the house, where she is busy cutting vegetables by the stove.
0:53:55|0:54:1|[Ren Changxia] finished speaking with a smile in her eyes, the fire under the pot was burning brightly at this moment, making her look particularly charming.
0:54:16|0:54:20|Grandma Ren Changxia chased to the door and looked into the distance, unable to help but recall the memories from before.
0:55:2|0:55:6|The scene returns to reality, with [Ren Changxia] standing at the door, hesitating to leave.
0:55:6|0:55:11|On the other side of the road, a car slowly approached and stopped next to a pedestrian.
0:55:26|0:55:29|Ren Changxia pulled the old man into the car after speaking.
0:55:29|0:55:35|Later, the car drove on the road in the field, inside the car, [Ren Changxia] looked at the uncle and spoke.
0:57:55|0:58:3|The uncle of the big car appeared in the picture at this time, took the steamed buns, and then the two picked up the chopsticks.
0:58:23|0:58:28|The uncle began to reminisce about the past, and the scene showed a man leaning against a car, who was [Niu Dong].
0:58:34|0:58:36|[Niu Dong] leaned against the car, unmoved.
0:59:6|0:59:8|Ren Changxia finished speaking and looked at the old man.
0:59:8|0:59:13|The uncle sat on the side, still bowing his head in silence.
0:59:26|0:59:34|Ren Changxia picked up the bowl, took a sip of porridge, and then looked at the old man.
0:59:34|0:59:39|Upon hearing this, the man looked up at [Ren Changxia], and then turned his head to look elsewhere.
0:59:47|0:59:53|The uncle nodded in agreement after listening, and then [Ren Changxia] continued.
0:59:53|1:0:6|The scene then shifts to a road, where a car is seen speeding through the night.
1:0:6|1:0:10|With the ringing of the phone, [Ren Changxia] appears on the screen and takes out her cellphone.
1:0:13|1:0:19|Placing her hand into her pocket, four bullets appeared in her palm.
1:0:56|1:1:4|[Ren Changxia] slowly put down her phone and froze, her expression tense, unable to help but recall.
1:1:4|1:1:7|Niu Dong, sitting beside, slowly opened his eyes, took a look, and then closed them again.
1:1:24|1:1:30|Ren Changxia took a few steps after hearing it, Jier turned to look at Niu Dong, and then slowly spoke.
1:1:44|1:1:47|[Niu Dong] listened and slowly put on his glasses.
1:2:0|1:2:4|[Ren Changxia] sat down immediately, only to see [Niu Dong] looking serious and saying.
1:2:46|1:2:54|Dong Xiaoting walked out of the room and closed the door.
1:2:54|1:2:58|On the other side, a car was speeding down the bustling street.
1:2:58|1:3:1|Before long, the car drove into a courtyard.
1:3:1|1:3:7|After passing by the surrounding police cars, the car slowly came to a stop in front of Ren Changxia.
1:3:15|1:3:16|Durian Geng saw several bullets.
1:4:8|1:4:12|After speaking, Liu Liangeng closed the car door, and the car started randomly.
1:4:12|1:4:19|He took a few steps, gazing at the car as it quickly drove out of the gate, then he took out his phone and spoke.
1:4:29|1:4:38|Accompanied by the sound of sirens, several police cars quickly drove out. On the road, [Ren Changxia] pushed the door open and then closed it behind her.
1:5:59|1:6:13|At this moment, the scene shifts to a stage, where the actors on stage slowly appear with props in hand accompanied by music. Then the four actors around take a few steps back, facing the center of the stage, and perform in coordination with the actor in the middle of the stage.
1:6:13|1:6:19|Finally, everyone waved their props, and the actor in the center of the stage kicked and turned, then jumped up with the props.
1:6:20|1:6:36|The audience in the theater cheered loudly. At this moment, a car slowly drove in from a distance and came to a stop. On the stage, an actor was flipping his body in the air, while two others next to him were fighting with props. The crowd below clapped and cheered, with [Maomao] also among them.
1:6:37|1:6:47|Ren Changxia was watching the performance with great interest. A man in a suit walked up to a car parked on the side of the road, leaned in towards the driver's seat, pointed at something, and whispered to the driver.
1:6:47|1:6:57|The driver then raised his hand, and the man sitting in the passenger seat stood up and got out of the car. The man in the suit walked to the man's side, raised his hand and pointed to the side. After a brief conversation, the two of them walked into the crowd below the stage.
1:6:57|1:7:16|On the other side, on the road, a police car is speeding. Before long, [Captain Qiu] opens the door and gets out of the car to look into the distance. Meanwhile, below the stage, the man in a suit is momentarily attracted by the performance on stage. After applauding, the two of them weave through the crowded people. At that moment, [Niu Dong] turns his head to look elsewhere, then turns around and leaves.
1:7:16|1:7:31|Before long, he climbed up a ladder and kept clapping his hands. At this moment, the man in a suit in the crowd pointed to another direction. The two of them then walked through the crowd towards somewhere else. Meanwhile, on the other side, [Mao Mao] was watching the performance on the stage attentively.
1:7:31|1:7:41|On the stage, drums and gongs were being played, creating a lively atmosphere. The actors kept changing their positions, dancing and spinning to the music, which elicited cheers from the audience below.
1:7:41|1:7:49|At this moment, two men in suits suddenly appeared in the crowd next to [Ren Changxia].
1:7:49|1:7:51|[Mao Mao] on the stairs immediately turned around and looked around.
1:7:56|1:8:0|At this moment, several police officers appeared in the crowd.
1:8:0|1:8:3|The man in the suit looked at [Mao Mao] in the crowd, then turned and walked away.
1:8:3|1:8:7|At this moment, the actors on the stage also stopped moving.
1:8:7|1:8:11|The scene changes, and we see [Ren Changxia] hurriedly running down the stairs.
1:8:11|1:8:16|Then, she ran through the lobby to the door, and hurriedly ran down the steps in front of her.
1:8:16|1:8:22|At this moment, a police car slowly stopped in front of her, then [Captain Qiu] got out of the car.
1:8:28|1:8:33|Captain Qiu smiled at Ren Changxia, and she then turned around to open the back seat door.
1:10:5|1:10:9|The two then got up and left, [Ren Changxia] looked back at [Liu Liangeng] and smiled.
1:10:32|1:10:36|Then, the shop assistant walked up to [Ren Changxia] and said.
1:10:36|1:10:40|Ren Changxia turned back and glanced after hearing it, Ren Changxia turned back and glanced after hearing it.
1:11:26|1:11:29|To take a family photo.
1:11:31|1:11:34|Ren Changxia smiled awkwardly after hearing it.
1:11:42|1:11:44|Saying that, [Liu Liangeng] looked at [Liu Liangeng].
1:12:7|1:12:9|After speaking, [Niu Dong] patted [Liu Liangeng].
1:12:26|1:12:28|No one could stop him.
1:14:18|1:14:23|After speaking, [Ren Changxia] waved goodbye to her family and the car started and drove away.
1:14:23|1:14:28|[Ren Changxia] stood still, gazing at the car, not moving for a long time.
1:14:28|1:14:32|Before long, a police officer got out of the car parked on the side of the road.
1:14:32|1:14:35|[Ren Changxia] immediately turned around and walked over to speak.
1:14:39|1:14:42|At night, a car slowly drives down the street.
1:14:42|1:14:47|Soon after, as the car turned a corner, a figure appeared on the side.
1:14:47|1:14:51|The car slowly came to a stop, and the person also took a few steps forward.
1:15:17|1:15:20|Several cars started up and drove out of the gate.
1:15:20|1:15:24|With the camera slowly moving, several police officers are seen leading the criminals out of the house.
1:15:44|1:15:47|At this moment, a police car slowly approaches and comes to a stop in the distance.
1:16:24|1:16:30|[Ren Changxia] then looked to the side and saw a woman with tears in her eyes, holding a crying child.
1:16:51|1:17:7|The child in her arms was crying incessantly. Upon seeing this, [Ren Changxia] immediately turned around and opened the car door.
1:17:7|1:17:18|The prisoner then slowly turned around, gradually bent his knees and knelt on the ground. Meanwhile, the child in the woman's arms continued to cry incessantly, tears streaming from the child's eyes.
1:17:18|1:17:20|Before long, the prisoners on the ground also slowly began to speak.
1:17:36|1:17:42|After speaking, the criminal recalled, and the image of [Niu Dong] appeared. [Niu Dong] was seen walking with his subordinates, suddenly turning his head.
1:18:38|1:18:47|After speaking, she slowly took off her police cap, wiped the tears from her face, and then said.
1:18:47|1:18:59|Xiao Wang then started the car and drove along the road in the village.
1:18:59|1:19:5|The clock on the wall is approaching one o'clock in the morning. The police officers inside the room are sitting at the table, and then, [Ren Changxia] speaks slowly.
1:19:9|1:19:14|Beside, Liuliang Palace put down the pen, [Liu Liangeng] notebook spoke.
1:20:12|1:20:17|The crowd fell silent after hearing this, then [Ren Changxia] looked at everyone and spoke.
1:20:23|1:20:33|In the blink of an eye, it was past two in the morning. [Ren Changxia] was standing in front of the case analysis, looking at the scene analysis of 126 on the blackboard, but she had no clue.
1:20:33|1:20:38|[Ren Changxia] immediately turned and left the meeting room, as the camera slowly pushed in on the blackboard.
1:20:38|1:20:43|Then, the scene shifts to [Ren Changxia], who is seen holding up a blanket and tidying it up.
1:20:43|1:20:51|Before long, she suddenly stopped, tapping the quilt with her fingers, then raised her head in contemplation and turned around to take out her phone and walk to the side.
1:20:52|1:20:54|The phone rang, and [Ren Changxia] slowly answered.
1:21:54|1:21:57|Captain Qiu finished speaking and looked at [Ren Changxia].
1:21:57|1:22:3|[Ren Changxia] glanced at him, said nothing, then turned around and walked slowly forward.
1:22:3|1:22:7|He took a few steps, then slowly stopped, sighed, and finally spoke slowly.
1:22:46|1:22:49|[Ren Changxia] shed tears as she spoke.
1:22:49|1:22:55|Captain Qiu, standing aside, looked at her, glanced around, then lowered his head without saying a word.
1:22:55|1:23:4|In the silence between the two, some cries could be heard in the quiet woods.
1:23:4|1:23:6|It seems like there's a child laughing.
1:23:42|1:23:50|The scene then fades out, and when it lights up again, the text at the bottom of the screen indicates that the time has come to April 14, 2004.
1:24:9|1:24:19|Accompanied by the sound of attacks and the distant ringing of a bell, a withered old tree appears on the screen, then gradually fades away.
1:24:19|1:24:26|At this moment, the scene shifts to the meeting room, where [Ren Changxia] is sitting at a table, deep in thought.
1:24:26|1:24:31|Before long, she picked up the pen again and bent over to write quickly.
1:24:31|1:24:36|As the camera continues to push in, we see the words "My Self-Criticism" written on the paper in front of [Ren Changxia].
1:24:39|1:24:49|Later, [Ren Changxia] sat at the table, massaging her temples with both hands, then tilted her head, leaned on her arm, closed her eyes to relax, and let out a slow yawn.
1:24:49|1:25:2|After a while, [Ren Changxia] opened her eyes and picked up the phone on the table to take a look. Then she turned around, put her coat on the chair, stood up and shook her neck. She also stretched out her arms, doing chest expansion exercises while looking out the window.
1:25:2|1:25:5|After the activity, she walked to the door, opened it, and took a deep breath.
1:25:6|1:25:15|She then walked to the washstand, put her hands in the basin to wash, picked up the towel on the rack, and then looked at herself in the mirror.
1:25:15|1:25:19|She reached out to touch the wrinkles beside her eyes, then applied lipstick in front of the mirror.
1:25:31|1:25:35|The scene shifts, and a car is seen speeding down the road.
1:25:35|1:25:42|Before long, the car stopped at the entrance of the Zhengzhou Public Security Bureau, and [Ren Changxia] got out of the car and strode towards the police station.
1:25:42|1:25:48|Then the scene shifts, showing [Zheng Gang] sitting in the office, flipping through the papers in his hands.
1:25:48|1:25:54|Then the camera slowly moves, gradually revealing the face of [Ren Changxia].
1:27:41|1:27:51|[Ren Changxia] finished speaking, looked at [Zheng Gang] with a smile, then turned and left the office, walked out of the Zhengzhou Public Security Bureau, and then she sat in the car.
1:27:53|1:27:59|The scene then cuts to a residential area, where a car drives in and slowly stops by the side of the road.
1:28:3|1:28:5|In the square of the community, the voice of [Ren Changxia] can be heard.
1:28:5|1:28:9|Mao Mao is running around kicking a ball in the square.
1:28:9|1:28:12|[Ren Changxia] pushed [Liu Liangeng] while keeping an eye on Mao Mao from behind.
1:28:12|1:28:16|Maomao then ran to [Ren Changxia]'s side, and the three of them continued to move forward.
1:28:16|1:28:19|Ren Changxia in the car looked at the three people and slowly closed the car window.
1:28:19|1:28:26|The car then drove away, and soon it reached the highway, slowly stopping behind the car in front.
1:28:26|1:28:28|[Ren Changxia] on the car lifts her head at this moment.
1:28:38|1:28:44|Afterwards, he opened the car door, got out of the car, then closed the door and took a few steps forward.
1:28:51|1:28:57|He took a few steps, then stopped again. At this moment, a gentle breeze came, slowly blowing his hair.
1:28:57|1:29:3|[Ren Changxia] stood still, adjusted his tie, and then walked away briskly, while the cars on the street remained motionless.
1:29:3|1:29:9|The scene changes, vast fields of rapeseed flowers come into view, with a figure slowly walking in the distance.
1:29:10|1:29:25|The woman walked while gently touching the rapeseed flowers beside her. As the camera moved, the face of [Ren Changxia] appeared in front of her. She had a cheerful expression but gradually stopped walking, lowered her head in thought for a moment, then raised it again, with memories of the past flashing through her mind.
1:29:25|1:29:35|The scene fades in, revealing a winding path. In the distance, a person riding a bicycle approaches. As the camera moves closer, the person's face becomes clearer, it is [Niu Dong].
1:29:36|1:29:45|He pedaled the bicycle with effort, with a thermos flask placed in the front basket. While riding, he would occasionally touch the thermos flask in the basket.
1:29:45|1:29:52|Before long, he rode down a small path and arrived on a road next to a construction site, with a bulldozer slowly approaching in the distance.
1:29:53|1:29:59|As the two cars approached each other and finally met, [Niu Dong] fell to the ground with both himself and the car.
1:29:59|1:30:14|He slowly got up from the ground, looked around, then turned his head to look behind. After that, he struggled to stand up, ran to pick up the thermos behind him, wiped it with his hand and held it in his arms. Only then did he turn around and walk to the back to lift up the car.
1:30:46|1:30:53|Happy New Year, happy New Year. After saying that, [Ren Changxia] walked to Zhou with the documents and sat down. Then, she lowered her head to look at the documents in her hands.
1:30:53|1:30:59|The scene changes, with the sound of firecrackers, fireworks are also being set off in the air, creating a lively atmosphere.
1:32:26|1:32:37|After speaking, Maomao lowered his head and slowly took out a thermos from his clothes. He then lifted the thermos slowly and looked at [Ren Changxia].
1:32:37|1:32:48|[Ren Changxia] then opened the lid of the insulated bucket, revealing steaming dumplings inside. She lowered her head slowly to put the lid back on, then raised her head, tears welling up in her eyes as she looked at Mao Mao.
1:32:50|1:32:55|Then, [Ren Changxia] choked back tears as she gazed at Mao Mao, her eyes full of tenderness.
1:32:59|1:33:9|[Ren Changxia] hugged Mao Mao tightly and tears streamed down her face.
1:33:9|1:33:11|After Mao Mao finished speaking, she also started crying.
1:33:15|1:33:27|[Ren Changxia] kept talking while constantly patting Maomao's head. Maomao had long been crying on her shoulder, unable to calm down for a long time. The scene shifted, and numerous fireworks flew into the sky, then bloomed.
1:33:27|1:33:36|Underneath the fireworks, a huge lantern formed by numerous small lanterns is revealed. As the camera slowly moves, groups of people appear beneath the giant lantern.
1:33:37|1:33:46|Some of them dressed up as dragons and ran back and forth, while others sat on the side playing gongs and drums. The atmosphere was lively, with everyone's faces beaming with smiles.
1:33:46|1:33:56|At this moment, the figure of Captain Qiu appears on the screen, seen banging the gong and drum with a smile on his face, surrounded by many villagers and police officers from the station.
1:33:57|1:34:2|Then, the martial arts team also appeared around, with [Ren Changxia] wearing a floral wreath.
1:34:2|1:34:11|In the scene, she is seen constantly moving her body to the rhythm of the music, smiling at the crowd, while the brilliant martial artist next to her slowly reveals a fuzzy face.
1:34:12|1:34:18|At this moment, Uncle Ding in the crowd waved his fan, constantly twisting his body as he walked back and forth.
1:34:18|1:34:21|Ren Changxia's companion, the old lady, also smiled and started dancing the yangko.
1:34:21|1:34:29|Following the animals, Ren Changxia and Liu Liangeng continued to walk. The dragon and lion dance troupes were still weaving through the crowd, earning applause from many onlookers.
1:34:29|1:34:34|The lively gathering brought the festive atmosphere to a climax, as well as the joy to a climax.
1:34:34|1:34:41|At this moment, both the police officers and the villagers had smiles on their faces, all praying for blessings in the coming year.
1:34:42|1:34:46|The scene then fades away, gradually revealing vast fields of rapeseed flowers.
1:34:46|1:34:49|[Ren Changxia] is walking briskly in the sea of flowers.
1:34:49|1:34:53|She smiled and looked ahead at the sea of flowers in the distance, moving forward.
1:34:53|1:34:57|The scene then slowly fades away, with the distant sunset shining on the road.
1:35:34|1:35:54|The words were not finished, the police officers in the meeting room stood up and froze in place. Then the scene changed, and when it lit up again, a group of nurses were seen carrying a covered stretcher. Behind the nurses were police officers in uniform, holding their hats in their arms, following the nurses slowly moving forward with unified steps and determined eyes.
1:35:54|1:35:56|The group kept moving forward like this.
1:35:57|1:36:3|The scene fades away gradually, showing a police car driving on the highway.
1:36:3|1:36:12|With the camera moving, we see behind the police car, followed by numerous vehicles, the cars flashing their lights continuously moving, forming a tight and endless convoy.
1:36:12|1:36:19|They drove along the highway, slowly descended a steep slope, and then quickly traveled on the city streets.
1:36:19|1:36:27|At this moment, a photo gradually appears on the screen. As the light on the photo fades away, a picture of the Ren family appears on the screen.
1:36:28|1:36:32|This photo was taken by his whole family at the photo studio before he passed away.
1:36:32|1:36:36|In the family photo, they are all full of smiles, overflowing with joy.
1:36:36|1:36:39|Soon after, many wreaths appeared in the scene.
1:36:39|1:36:43|As the camera continues to move, a police officer's figure appears next to the wreath.
1:36:43|1:36:45|He then turned and walked to the side.
1:36:45|1:37:3|The scene then cuts to a hall filled with wreaths and offerings, where many police officers are busy arranging flowers. Everyone is busy placing their flowers in the right spot, with [Captain Qiu] bustling back and forth. The camera then shifts to Chen Ju, who slowly sets down a bouquet of flowers, followed by a wreath appearing in the scene.
1:37:3|1:37:22|As the camera continues to move, the words "Rest in Peace" on the wreath gradually become visible. In front of the wreath, a police officer is adjusting the words on it. Then he slowly lifts his head, this person is [Liu Liangeng], tears welling up in his eyes. He turns his head to the side, and the picture of [Ren Changxia]'s memorial photo in the hall appears.
1:37:22|1:37:26|Liu Liangeng looked at the photo on the wall, then lowered his head and burst into tears.
1:40:16|1:40:23|The following scene fades away, as the camera slowly moves up, revealing [Niu Dong] gradually appearing in the frame.
1:40:23|1:40:28|He sat alone in a wheelchair with a scarf, staring blankly into the distance.
1:40:28|1:40:36|Then the scene shifts, and Ren Changxia is seen slowly walking into the frame. He then stops by a tree and looks into the distance.
1:40:36|1:40:41|After watching for a while, he walked quickly to [Niu Dong]'s side and bent down to speak to him.
1:41:22|1:41:34|After listening to the serious situation, Ren Changxia's face was full of worry. Then she slowly lifted her head to look into the distance, and the screen showed her smiling face in the center, with a very charming smile on her face.
1:41:34|1:41:41|In the scene, her smiling face and figure alternate back and forth, as she walks lightly and happily into this sea of flowers.
1:41:42|1:41:49|The camera then zooms in, with Ren Changxia standing in front of a sea of flowers, her eyes determined as she smiles and looks ahead.
1:41:49|1:42:0|Soon after, [Ren Changxia] slowly raised her hand with all her strength, then the scene gradually faded away, leaving only the silhouette of a person moving slowly in the distant sea of flowers.
