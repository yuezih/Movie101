0:0:26|0:0:43|In a messy studio, the male lead [Da Cheng] of the movie is creating a painting. He looks at the sketchbook in his hand, then glances back at the paintings on the wall. He then moves to the easel behind him, where a beautiful woman in ancient costume, surrounded by large peonies, leaps off the paper and into view.
0:0:43|0:0:50|However, the beauty was still missing the most important facial features, and [Da Cheng] hesitated on how to draw them with his brush.
0:0:50|0:1:4|He sighed and turned around, but the painting suddenly flashed with golden light. [Da Cheng] looked back at the changing painting, where the beauty now had long hair, enchanting eyes and eyebrows, a slightly open mouth, and a graceful and light figure swaying in the wind.
0:1:4|0:1:13|[Da Cheng] reached out eagerly, trying to grab the beauty, but she held a peony in her hand, spun around, and disappeared into the painting.
0:1:13|0:1:20|[Da Cheng] was greatly disappointed. He lightly clenched his hands and looked at his empty palms, then retreated a step in frustration.
0:1:21|0:1:30|Suddenly, petals fluttered in the air again, and [Da Cheng] gazed longingly in the direction they flew.
0:1:30|0:1:38|At this moment, a peony slowly blooms on the screen, and the title of the movie, "The Peony Fairy: The Emperor's Decree," gradually appears on the flower.
0:1:39|0:1:45|The scene shifts to a beautiful woman in Hanfu, dancing gracefully among peonies.
0:1:45|0:1:50|She wore a long dress with a peony hairpin between her eyebrows, looking playful and beautiful.
0:1:50|0:1:58|She moves gracefully, dancing lightly, her sleeves swaying with her movements, she is the most beautiful flower in the garden.
0:1:58|0:2:3|At this moment, [Da Cheng] walked through the flowers from a distance, but the beauty did not notice him.
0:2:3|0:2:7|Finally, as she turned around, she noticed the painter, the two of them following closely behind each other.
0:2:9|0:2:15|The painter lunged to grab the beauty, but she turned into petals and disappeared, leaving the painter shouting at the sky.
0:2:23|0:2:26|The hallucination fades, and the painter is back in the studio.
0:2:26|0:2:31|He seemed to have just woken up from a dream, suddenly turning to look at the painting on the easel.
0:2:31|0:2:35|He involuntarily moved forward to observe, but the painting did not change at all.
0:2:35|0:2:40|Just as he was carefully imagining the face of a beauty, suddenly, the television next to him made a sound.
0:2:40|0:2:43|The painter leaned in for a closer look.
0:3:0|0:3:4|The focus of everyone is only on one thing.
0:3:11|0:3:27|In the year 690 AD, during the first year of the Tian Shou era, inside the Imperial Garden in Chang'an, in the deep of night, the cold moonlight illuminated the earth. Not far away, a beautiful woman was seen lighting the street lamps, her movements graceful and elegant. At the same time, a flustered middle-aged man rushed onto the path of Linyi.
0:3:37|0:3:42|Uncle smiled satisfactorily after receiving a response, but the next second, an arrow flew in and pierced his body.
0:3:42|0:3:46|A group of people immediately ran forward, but they did not see his figure.
0:3:50|0:4:13|As soon as the leader left, a man appeared and walked forward to inspect, staring intently in the direction of his subordinate's fingers. The masked swordsman retreated into the bushes. At this moment, [Da Cheng] with the heavy sword struggled to walk towards the beauty. A shiny gun fell in front of the beauty as he tremblingly took out an envelope from his pocket.
0:4:13|0:4:26|After speaking, [Da Cheng] fainted. He quickly picked up the letter in [Da Cheng]'s hand, saw someone approaching in the distance, and swiftly hid the letter, preparing to leave.
0:4:26|0:4:29|The leader ran over angrily.
0:4:29|0:4:34|He tested Da Cheng's breath, then gave a fierce look at the beauty next to him.
0:4:34|0:4:39|The man we just saw is approaching.
0:4:39|0:4:41|The man gave the beautiful woman a cold stare.
0:4:46|0:4:54|[Da Cheng] was taken away by the guards, and then the lord turned his gaze towards the beauty. The cold eyes made the beauty shudder, and she instinctively moved away.
0:5:35|0:5:39|At this moment, the masked man picked up a stone and threw it at a window not far away.
0:5:46|0:5:50|A man forcibly embraced [Rui Yu], but was interrupted.
0:5:51|0:5:54|The other flower girls all protect the bullied peony girl together.
0:6:4|0:6:6|[Wu San] failed to achieve his goal and left in anger.
0:6:15|0:6:19|The flower girl looked around at the pitch-black night, curious about who had saved her.
0:6:19|0:6:23|Rui Yu fell into deep thought again, unsure of how to handle this unexpected letter.
0:6:23|0:6:26|The next day, in the grand hall of the palace.
0:7:41|0:7:45|[Empress Wu] had an angry expression on her face, and the arguing ministers cowered in fear, lowering their heads.
0:7:45|0:7:51|Then, he gave a signal to the little eunuch next to him, asking him to bring the prepared things over.
0:7:51|0:7:57|One of the ministers who had just argued glanced at the other person, then curiously looked at the thing being brought up.
0:7:57|0:8:4|The eunuch was holding a blank sacred paper, and [Empress Wu] gestured for the eunuch to completely unfold it.
0:8:4|0:8:7|He then picked up the pen and thought for a moment before deciding to start writing.
0:8:8|0:8:16|The pearl chain on the crown swayed gently as the minister who had just argued glanced sneakily at the other party, then looked up at [Empress Wu Zetian] who was writing the imperial edict.
0:8:16|0:8:25|In the grand hall, no one dared to speak, all quietly waiting for [Empress Wu Zetian] to finish writing the edict, only the palace maid fanning the wind gently.
0:8:25|0:8:30|After a cup of tea, she finally finished writing and came down from the Longnu.
0:8:30|0:8:37|The palace maids stepped forward to support her, while the young eunuch carefully rolled up the decree and turned to the ministers in the court to read it aloud.
0:8:39|0:8:42|The minister who disagreed with the early blooming was very surprised.
0:8:59|0:9:7|The ministers knelt down on the ground, while on the other side, in an ancient courtyard, Peony Flower Girl hurriedly ran from the yard to the front gate.
0:9:7|0:9:15|Opening the door, Rui Yu found two guards standing at the entrance, so she quickly retreated and firmly held the door with a stick.
0:9:15|0:9:22|She paced back and forth in the courtyard, feeling flustered and unsure of what to do, with an anxious look on her face.
0:9:22|0:9:26|Suddenly, her eyes changed, as if she had thought of something, and she pulled something out of her sleeve.
0:9:28|0:9:32|This is the letter that the uncle who died last night asked her to give to someone else.
0:9:32|0:9:35|She hesitated for a moment, but decided to open the letter.
0:9:35|0:9:39|The letter was wrapped in layers, clearly hiding important secrets.
0:9:39|0:9:54|[Rui Yu] carefully read the contents of the letter, thinking back to the uncle from last night.
0:9:54|0:9:55|She hides the letter in her sleeve.
0:10:3|0:10:10|After listening to the words of the Peony Pavilion lady, the other flower ladies also glanced outside the door, and everyone started to panic.
0:11:17|0:11:22|The five adults looked embarrassed, failing in one plan only to come up with another, then turning to look at their subordinates.
0:11:26|0:11:46|On the street, the flower girls are being escorted to Luoyang by the guards for defying the imperial decree, causing a stir among the people.
0:11:46|0:11:54|In the car, the flower girls had different expressions, listening to the sighs of the people outside the car. At the front of the team, riding a horse, was a serious-looking leader's guard.
0:12:52|0:12:57|Wu Zetian's skirt swayed, leaving a trail of liquid behind, with two palace maids following behind.
0:12:57|0:13:3|She walked majestically down the long staircase, with a minister quietly following behind her.
0:13:3|0:13:7|She couldn't grab the spotlight and slowly sat down on the dragon throne.
0:14:7|0:14:20|The carriage escorting the flower girls has now arrived in a valley, where everything is quiet except for a few bird calls. The guards look around, while [Wu San], who is lurking on the mountain, follows the carriage with his brothers sneakily.
0:14:28|0:14:36|Suddenly, a flying knife with a note attached pierced into the car body, causing the leader's guards to be on high alert.
0:14:36|0:14:51|He pulled out the flying knife, opened the note and read the four words on it: "Take a detour." [Wu San] who was following closely behind hurried to catch up.
0:14:51|0:14:55|[Wu San] also hurriedly led his men to catch up, closely following the carriage in front.
0:15:35|0:15:40|The 531 group followed closely, arrived in front of the carriage, and raised their bows and arrows ready to shoot.
0:15:40|0:15:48|Unexpectedly, the archer in black was hit on the back of the hand by a small piece of stone.
0:15:48|0:15:51|The leader of the guards heard the exclamation and ordered the team to stop.
0:16:16|0:16:23|The leader of the guards paced around, eyeing [Wu San] suspiciously, seemingly not believing what they were saying. [Wu San] looked nervous, afraid of being discovered.
0:16:23|0:16:29|The chief guard looked around again, and [Wu San] with a fearful expression, kept darting his eyes around, he spotted a loophole.
0:16:55|0:16:56|Then they all went their separate ways.
0:17:16|0:17:26|Wu San and his brothers were relieved to think they had fooled the leader of the guards. They kept muttering their thanks and then pushed each other, closely following the majority of the caravan's carriages.
0:17:26|0:17:42|A group of people arrived at an inn. It was springtime, with willow trees swaying and the gentle breeze brushing their faces. The group stopped in front of the inn.
0:17:42|0:17:44|The flower girls comfort each other with their eyes.
0:18:12|0:18:14|Next, [Wu San] walked towards Lord Jun with a glass of wine.
0:18:53|0:19:2|In the quiet of the night, as everyone prepared to rest, only Rui Yu remained, staring at the candle in front of her, looking lost in thought.
0:19:2|0:19:8|The flickering candlelight failed to conceal her worries, her brows tightly furrowed.
0:19:8|0:19:25|She was recalling everything that had happened in the past few days, and thinking about the crucial letter. She was about to take it out from her sleeve to have a look, but was interrupted by the sudden entrance of Rui Yu.
0:19:25|0:19:33|Peony Girl shook her head, rejecting his proposal, and walked to the bed, picking up the tightly wrapped peony seedling.
0:19:33|0:19:38|Peony carefully brought the package containing the sapling over and placed it on the table, then opened it up.
0:19:40|0:19:45|The sisters, seeing her actions, couldn't sleep either, and all came to the table.
0:19:45|0:19:50|The sapling that was uncovered still appears to be well protected.
0:19:50|0:19:59|The peony flower girl touches the sapling with her hand, while the young ladies who just suggested escaping hang their heads in shame.
0:20:29|0:20:35|The peony lady gestured for her fourth sister to come closer to listen, while on the other side, Wu San and others were also discussing their plan.
0:20:53|0:20:57|[Wu San] maliciously took out a small bottle from his pocket.
0:20:57|0:21:0|The next moment, he cautiously poked his head out from the door.
0:21:0|0:21:2|Unexpectedly, a pair of guards happened to pass by the door.
0:21:4|0:21:9|After the guard passed, the three of them sneaked out of the door one after another.
0:21:9|0:21:14|In the room, the flower girls were still fast asleep, unaware that danger was approaching.
0:21:14|0:21:17|Three people quietly arrived outside their door.
0:21:17|0:21:21|A smoking bamboo pole quietly extended into the room of the flower girls.
0:21:21|0:21:25|Wu San is outside the window, blowing the scent into the room with great effort.
0:21:25|0:21:30|The scent of the incense lulls the flower girls into a deep sleep.
0:21:30|0:21:33|Upon hearing that the flower girls were not making any noise, Wu San led his men to their bedroom.
0:21:36|0:21:40|Suddenly, [Wu San] widened his eyes as if he had discovered something.
0:21:40|0:21:45|It turns out to be the letter that the peony lady has been guarding all along.
0:21:45|0:21:48|[Wu San] holds the letter to his chest.
0:21:48|0:21:52|He then kicked his brother next to him, gestured at him to leave quickly.
0:21:54|0:22:4|At this moment, before the day had fully broken, [Rui Yu] and the others were walking along the deserted road when suddenly a long sword was thrust in front of them.
0:22:4|0:22:10|A masked man slowly turned around, looking at the pedestrians with sharp eyes, while Rui Yu's master was sizing up the masked man.
0:22:24|0:22:34|[Wu San] saw that his brother was not his match, so he tried to shoot him with a sword, but the masked man dodged it and even kicked a stone that hit him.
0:22:44|0:22:50|The masked man slowly points his sword towards the letter in Wu San's hand, causing Wu San to instinctively hide the letter behind him.
0:22:54|0:22:58|The masked man flew to dodge the package, leaving [Wu San] and his brothers stunned.
0:22:58|0:23:2|He opened the letter without saying a word, and [Wu San] looked at him indignantly.
0:23:2|0:23:7|The masked man threw the letter on the ground, angering [Wu San] who rushed forward.
0:23:7|0:23:10|The masked man unexpectedly flew away.
0:23:13|0:23:19|Second Brother was silently crying out in pain with his mouth wide open due to the injury on the back of his hand.
0:23:19|0:23:24|[Rui Yu] turned around and saw the letter dropped on the ground by the masked man, so she picked it up.
0:23:35|0:23:37|Second Brother and Third Brother suddenly realized.
0:23:46|0:23:53|On the other side, Peony, unaware that the letter has been lost, is being escorted to the ancient county town by the guards.
0:23:53|0:23:58|The ancient county gate was tightly closed, with guards standing on the city wall.
0:24:45|0:24:48|The Wudang flower girl gets off the carriage.
0:25:8|0:25:16|After the leader of each guard team finished the second sentence, [Rui Yu] turned around and left directly, leaving everyone unable to stop him, only able to watch him embark on his journey alone.
0:25:16|0:25:23|His gaze was firm, as if he was heading not to a county ravaged by a plague, but to a destination of travel.
0:25:23|0:25:26|He slowly walked into the city gate.
0:25:26|0:25:31|The 531 group arrived at the Wangye Mansion to report to [Da Cheng].
0:26:5|0:26:8|[Da Cheng] waved his hand and the thugs all left.
0:26:8|0:26:14|Wu San, who was originally kneeling on the ground, quickly jogged to Da Cheng's side, panting as he extended an invitation.
0:26:26|0:26:27|This time, be quick and nimble, grab the things and go.
0:26:41|0:26:49|In the ancient county town's street, there was only [Rui Yu] standing, his robe billowing in the wind.
0:26:53|0:26:58|The doors of every household were tightly shut, giving the impression that there were no living beings inside.
0:26:58|0:27:2|[Rui Yu] walked cautiously around, afraid that something might suddenly jump out.
0:27:4|0:27:8|He is unaware that someone is secretly watching him from the corner.
0:27:8|0:27:12|[Rui Yu] came to a door and looked inside.
0:27:12|0:27:17|The window was covered in thick dust, as if no one had lived there for a long time.
0:27:17|0:27:24|[Rui Yu] walked back and forth on the street helplessly, and tried shouting a few times.
0:27:28|0:27:31|Only the sound of birds chirping and a deathly silence greeted him.
0:27:33|0:27:38|At the gate of the mansion, the two brothers approached [Wu San] as soon as they saw him coming out, and [Wu San] also noticed them.
0:28:28|0:28:40|In an ancient courtyard in the county town, [Da Cheng] looked anxiously at the girl lying on the bed, who was his own daughter. The girl slowly opened her eyes.
0:29:20|0:29:22|Amidst the conversation, a series of urgent knocks on the door could be heard.
0:29:22|0:29:23|[Da Cheng] hurried out of the house and arrived at the door, asking cautiously inside.
0:29:42|0:29:49|Hearing the voice of a strange woman, [Da Cheng] peered through the crack in the door.
0:29:49|0:29:53|Da Cheng's Mom breathed a sigh of relief, opened the door, and looked at Rui Yu with reassurance in her eyes.
0:29:53|0:29:59|He peeked out at the street again, making sure that there was really no one following [Rui Yu].
0:30:8|0:30:17|The two were talking when suddenly a noise came from inside the house. [Da Cheng] hurried back and found his daughter had fallen to the ground.
0:31:12|0:31:21|Yingzi's father seemed to be incredulous, standing up and looking at [Rui Yu] with a skeptical gaze.
0:31:21|0:31:27|[Rui Yu] nodded vigorously, and Da Cheng's father took a step back, allowing her to sit by Yingzi's bedside.
0:31:27|0:31:33|[Da Cheng] saw [Rui Yu] being so sincere, and he also gained a bit more trust in her, standing aside and watching her.
0:31:33|0:31:38|[Rui Yu] pulled up Yingzi's sleeve and saw that her arm was covered with densely packed red spots.
0:31:40|0:31:45|[Rui Yu] quietly holds the wheat, while Yingzi looks at her hopefully.
0:31:45|0:31:49|[Rui Yu] frowned, feeling uneasy, and let out a sigh.
0:31:49|0:31:52|Da Cheng's Mom stood by, thinking all hope was lost.
0:31:52|0:31:58|Yingzi weakly opened her eyes.
0:32:3|0:32:10|[Rui Yu] didn't answer, she just smiled at him, carefully tucking Yingzi's arms back under the blanket and tending to his injured feet.
0:32:10|0:32:21|On one side, Ying's father hurried forward to inquire, [Rui Yu] hesitated slightly, looking at the anxious expression of the old man. She stood up from the bedside and pulled him aside.
0:32:32|0:32:36|Outside the ancient county town, [Wu San] and his group also arrived here on horseback.
0:32:36|0:32:40|Wu San noticed the notice on the wall and dismounted to take a look.
0:32:40|0:32:48|[Wu San] noticed that something was amiss. It was a bright and sunny day, but the surroundings seemed unusually quiet.
0:32:52|0:32:55|The city gate is temporarily closed.
0:33:2|0:33:4|In the cabin, [Rui Yu] is treating [Ying Zi] for her illness.
0:33:16|0:33:28|At his fingertips, he slowly unfolds the handkerchief he carries with him, puts the petals inside into a clean bowl, then he takes off the hairpin from his head, pricks his finger to draw a drop of blood.
0:33:28|0:33:34|Without any hesitation, [Da Cheng] let the blood from his fingertips drop down, and the petals revealed a faint glimmer.
0:33:38|0:33:42|He seems to be struggling, appearing somewhat weak.
0:33:42|0:33:48|Beside him, [Yingzi] looked at him with pity as he continued to drip blood into the petals.
0:33:48|0:33:52|When enough blood drops, [Rui Yu] also turns pale.
0:33:52|0:33:58|He picked up the blood-stained petals with his hands, clasped them tightly with both hands, and bestowed them with divine power.
0:33:58|0:34:0|Then place the petals on Rui Yu's back covered with rashes.
0:34:8|0:34:14|He repeated this action again and again until all the petals were used up.
0:34:14|0:34:24|His movements were gentle, and [Rui Yu] gradually felt no pain. The petals shimmered brightly in his hands, but with no sharp glare.
0:34:24|0:34:28|This move may seem simple, but it actually requires a lot of effort.
0:34:28|0:34:32|[Rui Yu] is doing her best to treat Yingzi.
0:34:32|0:34:36|After a long few hours, [Rui Yu] finally finished the entire process.
0:34:37|0:34:51|His forehead was covered with large beads of sweat, he was breathing heavily, trying to calm his body. Then he lifted the curtain and called for Yingzi's father who was waiting outside.
0:35:25|0:35:32|This kind of evil poison often spreads through water sources, and those heavily poisoned must be treated promptly.
0:35:34|0:35:37|The situation seems to be difficult for [Rui Yu].
0:36:6|0:36:15|These petals come from a special source, which is probably hard to find among the common people.
0:36:53|0:36:57|[Rui Yu] took a deep breath, anxiously lowered her head, thinking of a solution.
0:37:17|0:37:28|Rui Yu nodded, a faint smile appearing on her pale face without any trace of blood. Outside the city's official temple, the leader of the guards and the courtesans were still anxiously waiting for Rui Yu, while the sisters were filled with worry.
0:37:35|0:37:42|The group of Rui Yu, Da Cheng, Doctor Liu, Wu San, and Da Cheng's Mom somehow sneaked into the Guandi Temple without anyone noticing. They climbed over the wall and hid in a corner, peeking inside.
0:37:42|0:37:53|The leader of the guards is devoutly bowing to Lord Guan, while Wu San and the brothers are patrolling the courtyard. The leader of the guards senses something is amiss and looks around the temple.
0:37:53|0:38:0|Wu San and his brothers immediately hid behind the door when they saw him turn around. They only dared to peek out again after he left.
0:38:8|0:38:17|The guards chatted and chuckled, while the guard leader patrolled around the temple and approached the sitting flower girl.
0:38:57|0:39:3|The leader of the guards moved his mouth, as if wanting to say something, but in the end, he didn't say anything.
0:39:3|0:39:9|And eavesdropping [Wu San] heard the entire conversation, sneaking out from the wall.
0:39:9|0:39:13|Da Cheng's Mom was startled by the sudden appearance of Wu San and Lao Er.
0:40:33|0:40:37|In the candlelight of the night, [Rui Yu] is holding a bowl of flower petals, stirring with the hairpin on her head.
0:40:41|0:40:45|The dim candlelight shone on her face, giving it an extra touch of tenderness.
0:40:45|0:40:50|After finishing all this, she put the hairpin back on her head and handed the bowl to Yingzi.
0:40:50|0:40:55|On the bed beside, [Rui Yu] looked happily at her now smooth arms.
0:41:7|0:41:8|There was a sudden loud noise outside the door.
0:41:36|0:41:38|The 531 gang burst in with their faces covered.
0:42:11|0:42:22|The three were once again blocked by the masked hero from before. Before the second and third could speak, they charged forward. Wu San tightly grabbed Rui Yu, afraid that he would escape.
0:42:22|0:42:29|The hero dodged left and right, avoiding the arrows shot by the second brother, and also wounded the third brother with his sword, then he landed with a somersault.
0:42:30|0:42:34|Another leap, holding a sword and chopping down at Wu San, only to be blocked.
0:42:34|0:42:39|The hero decisively used the momentum to kick down Wu San, and then cut off the bow and arrow of Da Cheng with a sword.
0:42:39|0:42:43|[Rui Yu] anxiously watches as Da Cheng takes on two opponents at once.
0:42:43|0:42:47|Second Brother and Third Brother are no match for the hero at all, and Wu San also sees this clearly.
0:42:48|0:43:5|Wu San, feeling angry, prepared to sneak attack the hero from behind. Rui Yu, seeing his underhanded move, broke free from Wu San and rushed forward to block the incoming sword. The hero turned around in shock, seeing Rui Yu injured. In an instant, the hero went into a rage, kicking Wu San and the other two men to the ground. The brothers then helped Wu San up.
0:43:8|0:43:14|In a hurry, he left without stopping, and when he saw the three of them leaving, [Rui Yu] weakly fell into [Da Cheng]'s arms.
0:43:15|0:43:22|On the other side, Lord Ying and the county magistrate have found the leader of the guards, asking him to let Rui Yu stay a few more days.
0:43:22|0:43:26|The leader of the guards paced back and forth, hesitating.
0:44:14|0:44:16|The leader of the guards shook his head.
0:44:53|0:45:7|In a courtyard in the county, a woman is sewing clothes by candlelight.
0:45:7|0:45:13|[Da Cheng's Mom] closed the door tightly, while on the other side, Yingzi and her father were also awake, waiting for news.
0:45:16|0:45:18|It turns out that the masked hero's mother is the neighbor of Da Cheng's mother. The group of five people took advantage of the dusk to escape, and ended up at the Guandi Temple.
0:45:46|0:45:55|[Wu San] turned around and, in the deep darkness of the night, the statue in the Guandi Temple appeared eerie and terrifying, making him so scared that he swallowed hard.
0:46:15|0:46:22|In the midst of the conversation, [Wu San] pulled out an imperial decree from his bosom, looking smugly at the item in his hand.
0:46:39|0:46:43|Wu San curiously looked around at the contents of the imperial edict.
0:46:50|0:46:56|The next day, at the home of the masked hero, he is talking to his mother.
0:46:56|0:46:59|He looked cautiously outside the door to make sure no one was eavesdropping.
0:47:6|0:47:15|The hero's expression relaxed, finally relieved. On the other side, [Rui Yu] slowly woke up from unconsciousness.
0:47:15|0:47:22|Upon hearing Yingzi's exclamation, the two conversing individuals immediately ran in.
0:47:22|0:47:32|[Rui Yu] looked around and saw Yingzi sitting on the edge of the bed, overwhelmed with joy.
0:47:32|0:47:34|[Rui Yu] cast a grateful look at Brother Tang.
0:47:43|0:47:53|Rui Yu happily left, while Da Cheng gestured to his mother with his eyes, and his mother immediately understood.
0:47:57|0:48:4|Seeing his mother leaving with a smile, Tang Da Ge lifted his robe and sat down at the bedside of [Rui Yu], bowing his head to look at her.
0:48:9|0:48:21|Brother Tang suddenly paused, turned his head away, realizing he couldn't speak.
0:48:21|0:48:25|Brother Tang shook his head, disappointing [Rui Yu].
0:48:25|0:48:29|She suddenly had a thought, as if something had occurred to her.
0:48:35|0:48:38|[Rui Yu] finally relaxed and smiled gently.
0:48:38|0:48:41|Brother Tang felt relieved when he saw her sweet smile.
0:48:41|0:48:49|The two of them gazed at each other in silence for a long time, and a warm atmosphere filled the air, but [Rui Yu] seemed to still be feeling anxious.
0:48:49|0:48:57|At this moment, Big Brother Tang's mother brought a bowl of porridge, smiled at her joyful son, and then turned to [Rui Yu].
0:49:6|0:49:11|He took the porridge from his mother's hand and gently stirred it to cool down the temperature.
0:49:11|0:49:17|After testing the temperature, he fed it to [Rui Yu] bit by bit.
0:49:17|0:49:28|Mother Xianlian walked out, and before leaving, she turned back to look at the warm couple. Seeing her son treating [Rui Yu] so well, she finally left with peace of mind.
0:49:28|0:49:33|In the ancient county town, a ragged beggar holding a broken bowl looked towards a shop on the street.
0:49:40|0:49:48|The door was tightly closed. He pressed his ear against the door, listened to the movement inside, and, seeing no hope, walked away dejectedly.
0:49:48|0:49:54|He then turned and saw a person coming down the street. He turned and ran towards the person on the street, reaching out with the broken bowl in his hand.
0:49:54|0:50:1|The man quickly shook his sleeves and drove away the beggar, as if afraid of getting contaminated by something unlucky.
0:50:1|0:50:3|He had to start going door to door again, holding up the broken bowl and asking for help.
0:50:6|0:50:15|[Wu San] arrived at the county government office with his men on horseback. Despite the tight security, [Wu San] prohibited them from rushing in.
0:50:15|0:50:35|The guards at the door did not stop [Wu San]. Another wave of guards came out, [Wu San] waved the imperial decree in his hand, and the guards immediately stepped aside. He barged into the main hall, where there was no one. [Wu San] raised the imperial decree in his hand high, and it was only when the county magistrate and the leader of the guards heard the noise and came out that they saw the sudden arrival of [Wu San].
0:50:39|0:50:44|53 repeated it again, and everyone knelt down. He slowly opened the imperial edict, while Yingzi eavesdropped outside the door.
0:50:46|0:50:50|[Wu San] folded up the imperial edict, looking at the two with a triumphant smile.
0:51:55|0:51:57|Da Cheng's Mom looked at her son without any mistake.
0:52:2|0:52:6|The crowd fell into contemplation, when suddenly Da Cheng's Mom opened her eyes.
0:52:56|0:53:0|[Rui Yu] looked cautiously out the window and took off the hairpin from her head.
0:53:14|0:53:19|[Da Cheng] looked at [Rui Yu] tenderly, watching her shyly lower her head.
0:53:19|0:53:31|At night, [Da Cheng] climbed onto the wall of the county yamen, made sure there were no guards at this time, then jumped into the courtyard and approached a door, quietly listening to the movement inside the room.
0:53:47|0:53:52|[Da Cheng] took out Rui Yu's hairpin from his pocket and handed it to the frightened flower girls.
0:53:52|0:53:56|The leading flower girl took the hairpin and examined it carefully.
0:54:15|0:54:17|The flower girls exchange a glance.
0:54:42|0:54:49|The flower girls looked at the peony seedlings, silently communicating with each other through their eyes, unsure whether they should hand over the seedlings to her.
0:54:49|0:54:54|They nodded to each other and finally decided to hand over the saplings.
0:55:7|0:55:15|The next day, during the day, the county magistrate paced anxiously in the yamen, while Chen Zhong on the side was also pondering countermeasures.
0:55:41|0:55:47|Given the situation, not teaching Miss [Rui Yu] might be... like this.
0:55:55|0:55:58|The county magistrate nodded in agreement with his approach.
0:55:58|0:56:0|Chen Zhong became worried about the situation of [Rui Yu] again.
0:56:4|0:56:7|In the Lingyun mountains on the other side, the birds are singing and the flowers are fragrant.
0:56:7|0:56:12|Yingzi and [Da Cheng] are silently watching [Rui Yu] casting a spell in the distance.
0:56:12|0:56:16|[Rui Yu] took out the hairpin from her head and pricked her own fingertip.
0:56:16|0:56:21|Until drops of blood emerged, [Da Cheng] and Yingzi stood silently by, watching him.
0:56:23|0:56:30|Watching [Rui Yu] pierce her index finger with a hairpin, Yingzi and [Da Cheng] beside her were also very distressed.
0:56:30|0:56:35|He dripped blood on the peony seedling, and once again, something magical happened.
0:56:35|0:56:42|The withered peony seedling bloomed into brilliant flowers, blossoming on the branches.
0:56:42|0:56:48|[Da Cheng] turned away, unable to bear watching [Rui Yu] exhaust herself like this.
0:56:48|0:56:52|While [Rui Yu] took a deep breath and steadied herself, she began to cast a spell on the peony seedlings.
0:56:55|0:57:2|He was seen touching each blooming peony with his hands, infusing them with power.
0:57:2|0:57:10|The peonies on the saplings are in full bloom, full of vitality, each one as big as a baby's fist.
0:57:10|0:57:19|Eagle witnessed the whole process of [Rui Yu] casting a spell, still in shock with mouth slightly open, unable to come back to his senses for a long time.
0:57:19|0:57:23|[Da Cheng] also turned around and looked at the peonies watered with blood by [Rui Yu].
0:57:26|0:57:31|[Rui Yu] looked at the results she had worked so hard for and smiled with satisfaction.
0:57:31|0:57:40|She picked up a peony emitting a holy light from the branch, then looked at [Da Cheng] and Yingzi, reaching out her hands to hand the peony to the two.
0:57:40|0:57:46|Her face was filled with a contented smile.
0:58:12|0:58:19|[Rui Yu] and [Da Cheng] watched as Yingzi walked away. Overwhelmed with grief, she collapsed weakly onto [Da Cheng].
0:58:27|0:58:35|[Rui Yu] woke up from unconsciousness, looked around in confusion, and saw herself still leaning on [Da Cheng]'s chest, but they were sitting a bit apart.
0:58:35|0:58:39|[Da Cheng] just looked at [Rui Yu] with a worried expression on his face.
0:59:35|0:59:41|[Da Cheng] looked approvingly at the determined face of [Rui Yu], something blooming in his heart?
0:59:47|0:59:51|Rui Yu blushed and lowered her head when she heard such praise.
0:59:51|0:59:59|Rui Yu blushed and cast a shy glance at Da Cheng, who was still staring straight at her.
0:59:59|1:0:6|Hearing the sound of someone riding a horse approaching from a distance, [Wu San] hiding in the bushes raised his bow and arrow, aiming at the man galloping towards him.
1:0:6|1:0:9|He pulled the bowstring taut, ready to shoot as soon as the man approached.
1:0:13|1:0:18|Wu San shot an arrow, and the guard immediately fell off the horse and onto the ground.
1:0:18|1:0:24|[Wu San] saw that he succeeded, excitedly ran to his side, and first touched the neck of the guard.
1:0:24|1:0:29|After confirming it was safe, he searched the guard and found something.
1:0:29|1:0:32|Finally he touched it, it turned out to be a token.
1:0:32|1:0:35|Wu San tucked it into his arms and picked up the bow and arrow next to him, then left.
1:0:37|1:0:43|Sitting cross-legged on the mountain, [Da Cheng] gazes at every blade of grass and every tree in the mountain.
1:0:43|1:0:46|Under the sunlight, everything becomes gentle.
1:0:46|1:0:48|[Rui Yu] is also enjoying the beautiful sunshine.
1:0:48|1:0:52|She saw [Da Cheng] sitting there, and chuckled playfully.
1:0:52|1:0:54|She seems to have a mind to tease him.
1:0:54|1:0:58|[Da Cheng] also turned his head and saw [Rui Yu], watching him walking towards himself.
1:0:58|1:1:3|His gaze was fixed on [Rui Yu], never leaving for a second.
1:1:3|1:1:6|[Rui Yu] walked up to [Da Cheng] and the two gazed at each other affectionately.
1:1:7|1:1:15|In an ambiguous atmosphere, [Da Cheng] finally couldn't hold back and spoke first under [Rui Yu]'s gaze.
1:1:23|1:1:26|[Rui Yu] shyly smiles.
1:1:36|1:1:44|[Rui Yu] couldn't help but think again when she heard [Da Cheng]'s words. Seeing her smile, [Da Cheng] also felt embarrassed and lowered his head, both of them avoiding eye contact.
1:1:44|1:1:48|Suddenly, [Rui Yu] had a familiar feeling.
1:2:24|1:2:29|[Da Cheng] blurted out, and [Rui Yu] chuckled softly, feeling embarrassed herself.
1:2:29|1:2:34|[Rui Yu] couldn't help but be amazed by her simple and honest appearance. As their eyes met, sparks of love flew between them.
1:2:36|1:2:40|In the warm sunshine on the other side, the clinic in front of Yingzi's house is conducting consultations.
1:2:40|1:2:46|Underneath the wall, there is a notice stating that under the instructions of the divine doctor, the plague can be cured.
1:2:46|1:2:50|The people are lining up in a long queue, getting their pulses checked and receiving treatment one by one.
1:2:50|1:2:53|Yingzi consults with Doctor Liu while Yingzi's father fetches medicine, a scene of bustling activity.
1:3:12|1:3:20|Father Ying walked into the room, packed the herbs into a basket, all of which contained petals of peonies that were born from the blood of [Rui Yu].
1:3:20|1:3:33|Due to the large number of sick people, there is almost no medicine left. Many commoners are still waiting outside the clinic to receive their medicine.
1:3:33|1:3:36|The beggar who had been begging everywhere approached sneakily.
1:3:39|1:3:52|Second Brother pretended to understand, nodded and wanted to stand up and leave, but then looked back at [Rui Yu] with a reluctant expression.
1:4:16|1:4:24|The beggar quickly walked away when he didn't get the answer he wanted from the baby's mouth.
1:4:56|1:5:3|Wu San is handed the token that was taken from the guard by Lao San from his pocket.
1:5:3|1:5:8|[Wu San] took the token, rubbed it on his body, and stood up thoughtfully holding it in his hand.
1:5:29|1:5:32|Rui Yu and Da Cheng exchanged a knowing look, as if they had suddenly realized something.
1:5:41|1:5:47|Wu San seemed reluctant to go. After asking Wu San, at Rui Yu's home, Rui Yu and her father finished a busy day.
1:6:22|1:6:26|Wu San, who was outside the door, overheard everything and quietly left.
1:6:26|1:6:31|In the pouring rain on the mountain, [Rui Yu] was still unaware that danger was approaching, happily picking wildflowers.
1:6:31|1:6:39|[Da Cheng] watched the surroundings closely, while [Rui Yu] admired the wildflowers in his hands, carefully arranging them and holding them close to his chest.
1:6:39|1:6:43|[Da Cheng] is still patrolling around, guarding the safety of [Rui Yu].
1:6:43|1:6:45|In the distance, [Rui Yu] walks up from the hillside.
1:7:33|1:7:35|[Rui Yu] pondered for a few seconds and then said with a smile.
1:7:53|1:7:57|[Da Cheng] glanced at [Rui Yu], and both of them awkwardly avoided eye contact.
1:8:28|1:8:32|[Rui Yu] smiled, put down the embroidery in her hands, and looked at [Ying Zi].
1:8:46|1:8:54|[Rui Yu] remembered scenes from her childhood, in a dreamlike realm where an old man with floating dust would gently tap her head.
1:9:25|1:9:38|[Rui Yu] gradually immersed in memories of the past, the county magistrate paced anxiously, pondering how to handle the imperial decree, and worrying about [Rui Yu] and the others, while Chen Zhong looked into the distance, as if contemplating something.
1:10:28|1:10:34|While on the other side, [Yingzi] is spinning and dancing in [Rui Yu]'s dress, even [Da Cheng] is stunned.
1:10:44|1:10:49|At this moment, Da Cheng's Dad was shuttling through the mountains, getting ready to come and deliver a message to Rui Yu and Da Cheng.
1:10:49|1:10:57|Suddenly, he heard someone approaching in the distance. He looked closely and saw [Wu San] and his soldiers marching towards them in a grand manner.
1:10:57|1:11:1|The army passed by, raising clouds of dust, with [Wu San] proudly sitting high on his horse.
1:11:1|1:11:9|Father Ying secretly thought it was not good, quickened his pace up the mountain, hurried to inform [Rui Yu] and the other two, and kept looking back at [Wu San]'s position from time to time to make sure he was not being caught up.
1:11:12|1:11:14|[Da Cheng] dropped the firewood in his hands and ran over.
1:11:25|1:11:27|Rui Yu's father gasped for breath, unable to speak.
1:12:11|1:12:15|Da Cheng's Dad took a look at Da Cheng, who was wearing [Rui Yu]'s clothes, and came up with a solution.
1:12:15|1:12:17|Yingzi also found it strange why Dad was looking at herself like that.
1:12:37|1:12:43|Just make Yingzi up to look like you, and let the old car smoothly leave the ancient county town.
1:13:4|1:13:8|Rui Yu reluctantly agreed when she saw how sincere Yingzi's father was.
1:13:25|1:13:32|Unable to stop them in time, Da Cheng and Rui Yu could only watch helplessly as Yingzi and her father went off on their adventure.
1:13:32|1:13:40|[Da Cheng] looked at [Rui Yu] with a look of frustration and helplessness, continuously pounding on the tree trunk, unable to help but console her.
1:13:40|1:13:48|Rui Yu was moved to tears and hugged a tree trunk as Yingzi and her father disappeared into the bushes.
1:13:52|1:13:56|[Da Cheng] wanted to comfort her, but didn't know how to start.
1:13:56|1:13:59|[Wu San] is searching around for the figure of [Rui Yu].
1:13:59|1:14:3|Suddenly, Wu San seemed to see the person he was looking for.
1:14:3|1:14:12|Everyone looked in the direction they were pointing, and [Wu San] seemed to have seen it too. He quickly jumped off the horse and moved closer to take a better look.
1:14:18|1:14:23|On the other side in the distance, there is the figure of [Rui Yu] running, which shocks everyone.
1:14:42|1:14:49|Older Brother Two and Older Brother Three, who received the order, immediately took action, leading their subordinates to cross the river to capture [Rui Yu] and the person pretending to be [Rui Yu].
1:14:49|1:14:55|In the county town, Chen Zhong and the flower girls were also waiting for [Rui Yu] and the others to return, the flower girls gathered together and looked out towards the carriage.
1:15:44|1:15:53|Chen Zhong nodded in agreement, while on the other side, the captors [Second Brother] and [Third Brother] returned empty-handed, and went back to [Wu San], panting heavily from exhaustion.
1:15:53|1:15:55|[Da Cheng] and [Wu San] were too tired to speak.
1:16:0|1:16:14|[Wu San] angrily looks at the two, [Lao Er] and [Lao San] reluctantly explain to [Wu San].
1:16:14|1:16:20|[Wu San] stood up angrily and suddenly realized that there was something strange about this matter.
1:16:31|1:16:36|Chen Zhong reluctantly compromised with the county magistrate and decided to deceive [Wu San] together.
1:16:36|1:16:40|Yingzi rushed over in [Rui Yu]'s clothes, trying her best to cover her face.
1:16:40|1:16:48|The magistrate glanced at Chen Zhong, pretending not to recognize him, and the flower girls thought Yingzi was [Rui Yu].
1:17:1|1:17:7|Yingzi turned around and saw Chen Zhong walking towards her. The flower girls were afraid of her being discovered, so they all blocked her with their bodies.
1:17:11|1:17:20|The carriage moved slowly, while [Da Cheng] on the other side led Rui Yu back home.
1:17:20|1:17:24|[Da Cheng] helped the weak Rui Yu into the house, while his mom quickly closed the door.
1:17:27|1:17:32|[Rui Yu] overheard the conversation between the mother and son, and became suspicious.
1:17:50|1:17:57|At night, Chen Zhongzheng rode a horse, escorting other flower girls and the disguised [Rui Yu] (英子) towards Luoyang.
1:17:57|1:18:4|The quiet night made people feel uneasy, only the sound of horses passing by could be heard.
1:18:5|1:18:8|Yingzi only just realized that she had been discovered long ago.
1:18:18|1:18:23|The flower girls looked at each other and shook their heads, while Chen Zhong smiled sarcastically.
1:18:48|1:18:51|It's almost dawn, turning around that bend ahead, we're back at the border of Luoyang.
1:18:56|1:18:59|The group continued to ride their horses, hurrying along the road under the cover of night.
1:18:59|1:19:4|In the ancient county town, at [Da Cheng]'s home, he decides to confess his identity to [Rui Yu].
1:19:4|1:19:8|After much hesitation, he finally made up his mind and spoke out.
1:19:21|1:19:23|Encountered opposition from Lord Di.
1:19:23|1:19:28|Da Cheng was deeply troubled by this, so he secretly colluded with the rebels, intending to rebel.
1:19:31|1:19:33|Da Cheng holds a letter in his hand.
1:20:18|1:20:20|[Da Cheng] nodded.
1:20:46|1:20:50|[Rui Yu] took out the letter from her pocket and handed it to [Da Cheng].
1:21:13|1:21:34|Mother, after [Da Cheng] made sure of [Rui Yu]'s safety and picked up the sword to leave, he was actually reluctant to part. [Da Cheng] understood the same reluctance in [Rui Yu]'s eyes. [Da Cheng's Mom] pushed him to leave, and only then did he turn around. [Rui Yu] watched [Da Cheng] walk away, leaning against the door frame with reluctance.
1:21:34|1:21:48|With a worried look on her face, Rui Yu was concerned about his departure, not knowing when they would meet again. The next day, Chen Zhong and the flower girl hurried on the road and arrived at a valley. Suddenly, a group of people armed with weapons rushed out from the roadside, Wu San among them, and shouted, "Stop!"
1:22:21|1:22:26|Wu San looked smugly at Chen Zhong, thinking he was done for, but Chen Zhong remained unfazed.
1:22:34|1:22:45|Family members pulled the flower girl down from the carriage, and she angrily shook off the hand holding her. A young man in [Rui Yu]'s clothes was then pulled out from the crowd.
1:22:45|1:22:55|Wu San's face changed, he stepped forward and stared at Yingzi. He forcibly turned Yingzi's body around, examined his face closely. Yingzi was scared by his intense gaze and dared not to look up, then was pushed away abruptly.
1:22:55|1:22:59|Wu San turned his head and looked at the smiling Chen Zhong, only then did he realize that he had been fooled.
1:23:23|1:23:29|Chen Zhong blocked the knife falling from Wu San for Ying Zi, and Wu San and Chen Zhong confronted each other, neither giving in.
1:23:33|1:23:36|[Wu San] saw that he couldn't beat Chen Zhong, so he signaled to Lao San.
1:23:36|1:23:39|Wu San drew his knife and swung it fiercely at Yingzi.
1:23:39|1:23:47|Chen Zhong saw Yingzi injured, kicked Wu San away with one foot, and then kicked Lao San down with another foot.
1:23:47|1:23:48|Yingzi reluctantly closed her eyes.
1:23:58|1:24:2|At this moment, [Wu San] raised the imperial decree, prompting Lao Er and Lao San to quickly hide beside him.
1:24:2|1:24:7|Chen Zhong was stunned as he looked at the imperial decree, while [Wu San] stared at him threateningly.
1:24:7|1:24:12|The crowd knelt down towards the imperial edict, and Chen Zhong also slowly put down the sword in his hand.
1:24:12|1:24:20|Chen Zhong's face showed a hint of conflict, making him doubt whether his loyalty had gone wrong.
1:24:20|1:24:23|He weakly planted the sword into the ground and knelt down in front of [Wu San].
1:24:24|1:24:29|His soldiers also knelt down with Chen Zhong, and [Wu San] laughed wildly.
1:24:29|1:24:35|The flower girls embraced the fallen Yingzi, looking at [Wu San] with dissatisfaction but also helplessness.
1:24:35|1:24:39|Rui Yu lost his life like this, never to wake up again.
1:24:39|1:24:46|In the empty palace, where secrets are as clear as water, conspiracies are revealed.
1:24:48|1:25:8|[Wu Zetian] appeared in the main hall, slowly walking towards the dragon throne with the support of the eunuch. Without saying a word, he sat down on the dragon throne, then turned his head to stare at [Da Cheng] kneeling on the ground. He then gestured with his hand, and the guards beside him came forward to pull him away.
1:25:8|1:25:18|The enemy listened to the pleas for mercy from [Wucheng Temple] with great satisfaction. [Wu Zetian] was deeply saddened by the actions of [Wucheng Temple], showing a pained expression, then he pulled himself together.
1:25:20|1:25:25|[Da Cheng] heard the call of [Empress Wu Zetian], and walked into the hall magnificently to pay his respects to her.
1:25:38|1:25:41|In the ancient county town, [Rui Yu] is treating the people.
1:25:42|1:25:47|He takes the pulse of every patient, applies ointment for them, and tells them how to use the medicine.
1:25:47|1:25:53|He patiently answered the questions of the patients who came for consultation, without a hint of impatience.
1:25:53|1:26:6|Day after day, he never once complained of being tired. [Da Cheng's Mom] and Doctor Liu were also helping to treat the people, while [Da Cheng], who was always thinking day and night, was riding a horse with someone rushing over.
1:26:6|1:26:15|He rode a horse for a thousand miles to rush to [Rui Yu], just for the two to meet as soon as possible, and for the bad guys to receive their deserved punishment sooner.
1:26:15|1:26:23|Unexpectedly, it was [Wu San] who led the soldiers into the town first, disrupting the peace of the small town. The people panicked and spontaneously gathered at the entrance of the clinic.
1:26:24|1:26:32|Inside the house, [Rui Yu], [Da Cheng], and [Doctor Liu] heard the commotion outside and came out to see what was happening, only to find [Wu San] at the door.
1:26:36|1:26:44|The subordinate whispered to [Wu San], who nodded. The people gathered at the entrance of the clinic to protect [Rui Yu] and [Wu San].
1:26:44|1:26:49|Wu San looked disdainfully at the crowd gathered at the door, and walked up to threaten them.
1:26:58|1:27:0|The once quiet crowd suddenly became noisy.
1:27:19|1:27:27|Wu San gave the order, and chaos erupted instantly. The commoners resisted the soldiers with their bodies, while Rui Yu tried to push through the crowd to get out.
1:27:27|1:27:33|Magistrate Zhang, seeing the situation getting out of control, approached [Wu San], who gave him a sidelong glance.
1:27:56|1:28:0|Magistrate Zhang simply took off his official hat and answered him firmly.
1:28:25|1:28:30|Seeing the people no longer following orders, [Wu San] also panicked. He took a deep breath and shouted loudly at the crowd.
1:28:37|1:28:42|[Rui Yu] heard that the safety of the people was being threatened and wanted to come out, but unexpectedly was blocked.
1:28:42|1:28:46|She pushed through the crowd in front of her and walked out without hesitation.
1:28:46|1:28:49|She stood still in front of the crowd, looking directly at [Wu San].
1:28:49|1:28:51|[Wu San] sneered when he saw her.
1:29:8|1:29:23|The crowd got into a fight with the soldiers brought by [Wu San] to protect [Rui Yu]. [Wu San] could no longer control the situation at the banquet and signaled to his henchman upstairs to act quickly. Without hesitation, the henchman shot an arrow towards [Rui Yu], piercing straight into his chest.
1:29:24|1:29:29|[Rui Yu] clutched his chest and fell down, landing in the arms of [Da Cheng's Mom].
1:29:29|1:29:39|Under the bright sunshine, her face was pale and she was struggling to breathe.
1:29:39|1:29:43|Wu San on the side was secretly pleased, when suddenly, Lao San ran forward and said.
1:30:0|1:30:6|Second Brother grabbed something and ran away, but unfortunately it was already too late.
1:30:6|1:30:14|Everyone was beating up the second son, and at that moment, [Da Cheng] finally returned from the capital on horseback.
1:30:14|1:30:21|Seeing [Rui Yu] injured, [Da Cheng] quickly dismounted from his horse and squatted down beside him, looking at him with concern.
1:30:25|1:30:32|[Da Cheng] looked at [Rui Yu], who had fainted, in disbelief, his steps becoming heavier and heavier.
1:30:32|1:30:41|He squatted down, gently took [Rui Yu]'s hand, feeling her warmth, wanting to wake her up.
1:30:44|1:30:49|Onlookers couldn't bear to watch, wiping their eyes with their sleeves.
1:30:49|1:30:54|Upon hearing the voice of [Da Cheng], [Rui Yu] struggled to open her eyes, but she had no strength left to speak.
1:30:54|1:31:2|She forced a smile at [Da Cheng].
1:31:2|1:31:6|[Rui Yu] could no longer speak, so she could only look at [Da Cheng] with her eyes.
1:31:6|1:31:10|She understood [Rui Yu]'s meaning and took out an imperial decree from her bosom to show him.
1:31:16|1:31:26|[Da Cheng] stood up, holding the imperial decree and gesturing to the people around him, who all looked at him.
1:31:26|1:31:30|He shouted loudly with vigor, and the people all knelt down.
1:31:30|1:31:35|[Rui Yu] also lay in the arms of [Da Cheng's Mom], gazing at him.
1:31:35|1:31:42|He opened the imperial edict and read it aloud to the villagers kneeling on the ground and the motionless [Rui Yu].
1:32:8|1:32:13|[Rui Yu] heard about her reward and smiled with satisfaction.
1:32:13|1:32:20|[Rui Yu], who was hailed as the Peony Fairy, is using her own flesh and blood to help the suffering people.
1:32:20|1:32:26|Her soul lightly passed through every place, sprinkling her own blood everywhere.
1:32:26|1:32:31|Petals fluttered around her, even on her dress were blossoms.
1:32:31|1:32:35|Her eyes and brows slightly drooped, and the earth revived because of the magic power she spread.
1:32:37|1:32:41|Da Cheng is calling out to him in the distance.
1:32:45|1:32:49|The fairy who came to relieve the people's suffering.
1:32:52|1:32:59|[Rui Yu] floated lightly into [Da Cheng]'s arms, holding his hand and gazing at him with gentle eyes.
1:33:26|1:33:33|[Da Cheng] knew that [Rui Yu] was so kind, his eyes flickered, but he couldn't say any words of dissuasion.
1:33:33|1:33:44|Following that, [Rui Yu] leaned tightly against [Da Cheng]'s shoulder. In the vast expanse of the world, only the two of them remained quietly together, hoping that time could freeze at this moment.
1:33:44|1:33:48|The people finally sculpted a statue for [Rui Yu], so that he could forever guard this land.
1:33:48|1:33:53|Hundreds of years later, in a scenic area in Luoyang City, tourists are admiring the blooming peonies.
1:34:10|1:34:13|Rui Yu, who is close to life, also enjoys the peonies.
1:34:19|1:34:22|The white peony you see now.
1:34:31|1:34:32|Many magical things have happened.
1:34:36|1:34:45|[Da Cheng] is using his brush to depict the peony in front of him, while [Rui Yu] walks over. However, the focused [Da Cheng] doesn't notice her presence.
1:34:45|1:34:56|[Rui Yu] smiled as she looked at the peonies in front of her, then bent down to pick up a petal from the flower pond. She held the petal up to the sunlight, the petal still glistening with water droplets, looking clean and transparent.
1:34:57|1:35:4|He looked at the petals, his eyelashes long and fluttering, as the wind gently blew by, occasionally lifting his hair.
1:35:4|1:35:10|Later, [Rui Yu] placed the petals on the tip of her nose, delicate, as if trying to smell the scent of old memories from within.
1:35:10|1:35:15|At this moment, [Da Cheng] finally noticed the elegant peony flower [Rui Yu] standing beside him.
1:35:15|1:35:20|[Rui Yu] also felt a scorching gaze and turned to look at [Da Cheng].
1:35:20|1:35:24|[Da Cheng] stared straight at [Rui Yu], as if he had seen this person somewhere before.
1:35:24|1:35:27|The other person avoided his gaze and turned away.
1:35:28|1:35:30|[Da Cheng] saw [Rui Yu] leaving and hurried to catch up.
1:35:30|1:35:35|At this moment, [Rui Yu] is looking up, carefully admiring a stone wall.
1:35:35|1:35:41|In the stone wall are finely carved peonies, suddenly, a figure stands in front.
1:35:41|1:35:47|[Rui Yu] looked up and saw [Da Cheng], who was panting heavily, looking at him silently.
1:35:47|1:35:51|[Rui Yu]'s friendly smile confirmed to [Da Cheng] that their hearts were in sync.
1:35:51|1:35:56|The two walked towards each other along the stone stele, with [Da Cheng] never taking his eyes off [Rui Yu].
1:35:57|1:36:3|He slowly approached [Rui Yu], looking at her familiar and beautiful face.
1:36:3|1:36:7|[Rui Yu] heard [Da Cheng] calling her name, and she smiled gently at him.
1:36:7|1:36:13|Seeing [Rui Yu] respond to his call, [Da Cheng] also showed a smile as if he had found a treasure.
1:36:14|1:36:20|[Rui Yu] lowered his head and brought out a handful of peonies from behind, which once witnessed their love.
1:36:20|1:36:26|He held up the peony to [Da Cheng], who looked at his actions knowingly.
1:36:26|1:36:37|[Rui Yu] vigorously throws the peony petals into the sky, and the petals fall on the shoulders of the two people, who watch the falling petals in awe.
