0:4:56|0:5:17|[Ye Wenwen] pulled the door curtain to prepare to change out of her wedding dress, [Gu Xiaolei] and [Ling Xiao] also got up from their sleep. As a first officer, [Ling Xiao] skillfully tied his tie and quickly changed his shoes to go to work at the airport. [Gu Xiaolei] also changed into the uniform of airport security personnel. She dressed neatly, quickly put on makeup, styled her hair, and rushed to her work position, starting a day of work.
0:5:18|0:5:32|After finishing a day's work, [Ling Xiao] made a phone call in the car, driving on the road in his own car. The camera followed [Ling Xiao]'s car, and as classical music played, director [Liu Jiang]'s name appeared on the screen.
0:5:36|0:5:49|The following scene shows a billboard with pictures of the four female leads in wedding dresses. The camera slowly pans up to the sky, revealing the title of the movie, "Let's Get Married".
0:5:49|0:5:54|With the end of the music, the movie entered the main part.
0:5:55|0:6:4|In the airport, [Ling Xiao] wearing sunglasses looks down at [Gu Xiaolei], while [Gu Xiaolei] carefully inspects the items packaged in front of her.
0:6:14|0:6:24|[Gu Xiaolei] picked up a packaged bottle of skincare product and said, "[Ling Xiao]," impatiently taking off his sunglasses, questioned her:
0:6:31|0:6:43|[Gu Xiaolei] took out a box of condoms from her bag, and the crew members burst into laughter when they saw this scene.
0:6:53|0:7:3|[Gu Xiaolei] packed up the bag in front of her and pushed it towards [Ling Xiao]. [Ling Xiao] put on his sunglasses, gave her a smile, then turned and walked away. After [Gu Xiaolei] returned a fake smile to him, she continued working.
0:7:5|0:7:29|A plane flew over from the sky and landed in Rome, Italy. [Wen Yi] was dragging a suitcase and a violin out of the airport. Accidentally, she collided with someone next to her. The person immediately bowed and apologized, saying sorry, sorry. [Wen Yi] ignored him and walked to the side with her suitcase.
0:7:38|0:7:52|Hello, [Wen Yi] glanced at the person, still ignoring him. She picked up her phone and saw a text message from [Wang Yunfei], which contained the phone number of Italian director [Li Xiang]. [Wen Yi] dialed director [Li Xiang]'s number.
0:7:55|0:8:2|Upon hearing the voice, [Wen Yi] turned around and saw the person who had just collided with her, little did she expect it to be [Li Xiang].
0:9:17|0:9:36|Pavarotti, with his head held high, began to sing the song of Pavarotti, one of the world's top three tenors. Following Pavarotti's singing, the scene showed the streets of Rome, Italy. [Wen Yi] excitedly took out her phone from the car and reached out to take photos. As the music ended, the camera returned to Beijing, China.
0:9:38|0:9:48|Li Feng, dressed in a suit and holding a bouquet of roses, stood still as [Ye Wenwen] looked at the person in front of her.
0:10:21|0:10:27|After saying what she wanted to say, [Ye Wenwen] walked away in high heels without looking back, while [Li Xiang] stood still holding flowers.
0:10:27|0:10:36|After a while, he walked to the front desk and put down the flowers. The receptionist smiled at him slightly and watched him leave.
0:10:36|0:10:44|Later, [Ye Wenwen] quietly shed tears in the corner of the bridal shop, and the scene shifted to the restaurant.
0:12:28|0:12:32|[Wen Yi] sat slumped on the sofa behind, letting out a long sigh of resignation.
0:12:55|0:13:11|[Wen Yi] left an envelope and got on the bus to Batrila. The sunlight shone on her face through the car window. After a while, [Wen Yi] fell asleep on the bus. The scene then switched to the hospital, where Doctor Shao was holding a pregnancy test stick.
0:13:34|0:13:39|[Tian Haixin] snatched the pregnancy test stick and left, then made a phone call to [Cao Dapeng].
0:13:50|0:14:2|In the kitchen, [Cao Dapeng] hung up the phone, and in the next moment, a plane flew overhead. [Ling Xiao] finished his flight for the day, dressed in a pilot uniform, wearing sunglasses, driving home.
0:14:3|0:14:14|The soft light of the setting sun shines on [Ling Xiao]'s face through the window glass. When he arrives home, before entering the door, he sees a cardboard box outside. He puts down his suitcase and uses his hands to look through the contents of the box.
0:14:14|0:14:23|Inside the box were several small teddy bear plush toys. He then turned around and inserted the key to open the door, but after a few twists, the door did not open.
0:14:23|0:14:28|After pulling out the key and pondering for a moment, he turned towards the room and said:
0:15:14|0:15:19|Gu Xiaolei didn't lock the door, she turned and went inside, while Ling Xiao stood outside holding luggage.
0:15:19|0:15:28|Picking up the condom thrown by [Gu Xiaolei], he walked into the house. [Cao Dapeng] returned home after work.
0:15:28|0:15:37|Tian Haixin put a piece of meat in his bowl and set down the empty yogurt box.
0:17:36|0:17:43|[Wen Yi] looked around and turned to ask, "Is this Matera?" The driver replied yes, this is Matera. [Wen Yi] asked again about Matera.
0:17:46|0:17:54|The driver replied to him, "Yes, this is Matera." He took out a piece of paper covered in English from his bag. The driver told him, "No, Matera is far from here. This is Matera."
0:17:57|0:18:10|I'm sorry the bus drove away, [Wen Yi] stood alone with her luggage on the streets of Matera at night. When she saw the local villagers, she quickly asked, "hello, how are you?" The local resident replied, "hello."
0:18:15|0:18:37|Unable to communicate due to language barrier, she asked the locals at the hotel again. They said a lot of words, and at that moment, a dog in the distance started barking wildly at her. [Wen Yi] looked terrified, turned around to leave, but accidentally fell off the curb. The locals quickly helped her up and said some words she couldn't understand. She walked to the side, took out her phone, opened the contacts, found Wang Yunfei's number, and dialed it.
0:18:40|0:18:50|The fall just now left her arm injured with large bloodstains, and she cried looking at her injured arm.
0:18:50|0:19:11|Later, she found the phone number of the tour guide [Li Xiang], hesitating whether to make the call. She clenched her fist slightly, but hesitated to make the call. At the same time, [Ye Wenwen] sat at the table, idly holding a pen in her hand, lost in thought. [Gu Xiaolei] sat on the bed, quietly watching [Ling Xiao] beside her.
0:19:19|0:19:45|It was late at night in Matruh, with no one around. [Wen Yi] was leaning against the wall by the road when a car approached and stopped in front of her. [Li Xiang] and the aunt got out of the car, and [Wen Yi] started crying against the aunt. The night was still so quiet, with the cold moonlight shining through the window onto [Gu Xiaolei]'s face as she propped her head up, lost in thought.
0:19:46|0:19:54|The next morning, a chicken feather duster tickled [Ling Xiao]'s soles.
0:20:4|0:20:8|He opened his eyes in a daze and immediately jumped up when he saw the newcomer.
0:20:19|0:20:26|[Ling Xiao] rubbed his eyes.
0:21:14|0:21:19|Gu Xiaolei's mother saw Ling Xiao's half-exposed buttocks and shyly turned her head away.
0:24:6|0:24:22|Gu Xiaolei cried in a very aggrieved manner, bowing her head to wipe away tears. Seeing this, Ling Xiao hurriedly hugged her, gently patting her back. Ye Wenwen, who had gone to the bridal shop early in the morning, walked into the store and saw a model in the lobby who hadn't put on her clothes properly.
0:24:37|0:24:43|[Ye Wenwen] quickly put down the bag in her hand and walked towards the store.
0:25:41|0:26:8|[Ye Wenwen] nodded at her, and Wang Ke'er left the bridal shop with the flowers. [Ye Wenwen] nodded in agreement, then drove to Chen Zhenxuan's house. Upon arrival, she parked the car, got out holding the damaged wedding dress, and ran towards Chen Zhenxuan's house. She walked in.
0:26:10|0:26:38|Calling out a few times without getting a response, she then walked up the stairs to the second floor area. Still not seeing Chen [Zhen Xuan]'s figure, she continued down the corridor with the wedding dress in her arms. She arrived at a room with very elegant decoration, where a turntable was playing a classical piece. [Ye Wenwen] placed the wedding dress on the table.
0:26:38|0:27:13|Carefully adjusting the hem of the wedding dress, she turned around inadvertently and was startled by something behind her. She covered her mouth and looked at the panda plush toy in front of her. One tall and one short, they danced to the music. [Ye Wenwen] couldn't help but laugh out loud. One of the panda plush toys accidentally fell when it turned around, causing the other one to fall as well. They took off the panda headgear, only to reveal Chen [Zhen Xuan] and his son Yi Yi. The three of them looked at each other and burst into laughter.
0:27:13|0:27:18|On the other side, Tian Haixin is busy preparing for a wedding in the hotel.
0:27:52|0:27:59|[Ye Wenwen] squatted down to help Wang Ke'er straighten her skirt, then stood up and saw [Li Xiang] playing with a bracelet.
0:28:28|0:28:53|Li Xiang and Wang Ke'er walked hand in hand into the wedding venue, while Chen Zhenxuan on the sofa witnessed the whole process. Ye Wenwen held back her tears, slightly tilted her head up, controlling the tears from flowing out of her eyes. Then she sat on the sofa and picked up a balloon to play with.
0:29:45|0:29:53|The balloon being played with suddenly exploded.
0:32:55|0:33:30|Chen [Zhen Xuan] carried the drunken Ye Wenwen through the crowd fighting for the flower ball and walked outside. Wang Ke'er was preparing to throw the flower ball backwards with her back to the crowd, but her exaggerated movement caused the wedding dress to tear again. She quickly grabbed the torn part with her hand. The thrown flower ball happened to fall into Ye Wenwen's arms. The bridesmaid went on stage to cover Wang Ke'er's back, and Li Xiang immediately took off his suit and strode onto the stage, draping the suit over Wang Ke'er's shoulders. He helped his bride down from the stage.
0:33:30|0:33:40|On stage, there was chaos, followed by a sudden commotion in the audience below, with glasses knocked over and people scrambling for the flower ball, dispersing in all directions.
0:33:40|0:33:47|Chen [Zhen Xuan] smiled as he watched [Ye Wenwen] leave the wedding venue in his arms.
0:33:49|0:33:59|The next day, [Ye Wenwen] woke up from her dream, she slowly got up, holding her head.
0:34:1|0:34:15|Ye Wenwen lifted the blanket, got out of bed, and walked to the table. She saw a painting on the table depicting a family of three, but the mother's face was missing. Ye Wenwen stared at it absentmindedly.
0:34:18|0:34:33|[Zhen Xuan] is downstairs performing actions with his hands, he gives a thumbs up to Ye Wenwen, who is looking at the father and son downstairs through the window.
0:34:59|0:35:4|[Ye Wenwen] nodded and smiled, while [Zhen Xuan] lowered his head and said to Yi Yi:
0:36:1|0:36:8|[Ye Wenwen] nodded.
0:38:22|0:38:31|[Tian Haixin] fastened her seatbelt, started the car, and drove away. The next day, [Cao Dapeng] went to the hospital.
0:39:16|0:39:29|Doctor Shao took out the medicine from the medicine cabinet to hand it to Cao Dapeng, who had already left. He squatted on the roadside waiting for Tian Haixin. When he saw her get off the car and stand up, Tian Haixin got out of the car with a bag.
0:40:35|0:40:56|The crowd in front of the hotel disperses, and [Cao Dapeng] shakes his head helplessly, then angrily heads to the kitchen to start working. He puts on white gloves and walks towards the roast duck rack.
0:41:11|0:41:19|The disciple is blowing air into a duck with great effort. As the music plays, the scene shifts to Italy, where the weather is clear and sunny.
0:41:19|0:41:25|[Li Xiang] drove through the dusty country road and onto the asphalt road leading to Rome.
0:41:25|0:41:42|The car drove for a long time, dusk gradually descended, and they finally returned to Rome again, checked into the hotel they stayed at before. [Wen Yi] looked somewhat melancholy, slowly playing the violin against her neck, while [Li Xiang] watched her from the side.
0:41:42|0:41:59|The aunt sat on the balcony chair, holding a bottle of skincare product and squeezing a small drop onto her fingertips to massage and rub. The three of them sat there, lost in their own thoughts.
0:42:25|0:42:34|After listening to Li Xiang's words, Wen Yi contemplated silently for a long time, and decided to participate in the music competition. After the performance, the judges began to give their comments.
0:42:58|0:43:6|The host finished reading the list, and there was thunderous applause from the audience.
0:44:2|0:44:7|[Li Xiang] took the violin case from [Wen Yi]'s hand and took out the violin to hand it to [Wen Yi].
0:44:16|0:44:28|Seeing [Wen Yi] hesitating, [Li Xiang] held the violin against his neck, smiled at [Wen Yi], and started playing with the bow on the strings. [Wen Yi] looked at the person in front of her in astonishment, unable to believe that [Li Xiang] could play the violin.
0:44:30|0:44:41|The people on the street gathered around them after hearing the music, cheering and clapping their hands rhythmically. Everyone happily swayed their bodies to the beat led by [Li Xiang].
0:44:43|0:44:55|The aunt invited [Wen Yi] to dance. [Wen Yi] had already let go and started dancing, following the music. The music quickly integrated her into the local residents, and she happily danced hand in hand with them.
0:44:55|0:45:8|Li Xiang saw this scene, handed the violin to her, Wen Yi did not refuse, took the violin from Li Xiang's hand and started playing it at her neck, Li Xiang raised his hands to encourage the people around to move.
0:45:24|0:45:39|[Wen Yi] immersed in it, indulgently playing the violin in her hand. As the music ended, the scene returned to the country. [Ling Xiao] stood in front of a display case in the mall, looking at the rings in the case. After thinking for a long time, he returned to work at the airport.
0:45:40|0:45:49|On the second floor of the airport, he looked down and happened to see Gu Xiaolei's father. He followed Gu Xiaolei's father's footsteps and saw Gu Xiaolei's group.
0:46:13|0:46:22|Gu Xiaolei smiled as her parents and others left, then turned around to see [Ling Xiao] standing behind her. He had a cold expression on his face, hands in his pockets, looking at Gu Xiaolei. Gu Xiaolei stopped smiling and looked at him.
0:46:43|0:47:16|Tian Haixin turned to look out the window, Cao Dapeng reluctantly picked up a pen and signed his name on the divorce agreement. With the sound of the car door that Tian Haixin was paying close attention to, Cao Dapeng's heart also clenched. He regretfully tapped the steering wheel, drove back home to pack his luggage. He picked up the photo of him and Tian Haixin on the table, sighed softly, turned around, and started packing up his trophies.
0:47:34|0:47:46|The scene cuts to Gu Xiaolei's home, with [Ling Xiao] dragging his luggage past Gu Xiaolei.
0:48:9|0:48:23|Gu Xiaolei, with tears in her eyes, finished saying what she wanted to say. [Ling Xiao] remained silent, nodded, and then left Gu Xiaolei's home with a suitcase. As the door closed, [Tian Haixin] returned to her own home.
0:48:49|0:49:17|[Cao Dapeng] nodded towards the direction of the bedroom, indicating for [Tian Haixin] to go back to sleep. It was indeed an unusual day, the night felt so long. [Ling Xiao] dragged a suitcase on the overpass, watching the cars passing by underneath. Alone at home, [Gu Xiaolei] curled up on the floor of the living room, holding a teddy bear and sobbing. In her sleep, [Cao Dapeng] turned around to hug [Tian Haixin], only to be pushed away by her.
0:49:17|0:49:30|[Cao Dapeng] turned around, facing away from [Tian Haixin], slowly opened his eyes. The two people lying on the same bed were back to back, eyes open, lost in their own thoughts.
0:49:30|0:49:50|[Ye Wenwen] sat on the bed with a notebook in her arms. She searched a dating website on the notebook, then she did the marriage and love personality matching questionnaire on the website. Based on the answers, the website generated a portrait of a perfect man, and every aspect of the portrait was exactly like [Zhen Xuan].
0:49:50|0:50:4|At this moment, [Zhen Xuan] is wearing glasses, burying his head in drawing costume sketches. The table is scattered with fabrics and his unfinished sketches, the long night finally over as dawn breaks.
0:50:4|0:50:38|Last night, leaning against Tian Haixin and Cao Dapeng, Ye Wenwen and Zhen Xuan ended up embracing each other. The morning sun shone on them. Tian Haixin opened his eyes and saw himself holding Cao Dapeng. He quickly pushed him away. The two looked around and saw the word "喜" (happiness) posted all over the living room. They got up and walked towards the bedroom. Upon opening the door, Cao Dapeng was blowing up a balloon.
0:54:1|0:54:8|They passed through the city, crossed the small roads in the outskirts, and [Wen Yi] raised his hands, letting the wind pass through his fingers.
0:54:8|0:54:27|After driving for a long time, Li Xiang took Wen Yi and Auntie to a church.
0:54:55|0:55:5|[Li Xiang] took [Wen Yi] behind a door and pulled the curtain, [Wen Yi] couldn't see what was happening outside, standing behind, hands clasped tightly, head down, silently sitting and praying.
0:55:5|0:55:14|Outside the door, the priest said, "You can start praying now."
0:56:20|0:56:26|[Wen Yi] left, and outside the door, [Li Xiang] who pretended to be a priest, didn't move for a long time after listening to what [Wen Yi] said.
0:56:39|0:57:1|Sensing that Auntie and [Wen Yi] had already left, [Li Xiang] opened the curtain beside him, stuck his head out and looked towards the church entrance. Seeing the two of them walking away, he turned around to face the statue in the church, made the sign of the cross on his forehead, chest, and shoulders with his right hand. Then he turned around, closed the church door, and left the place.
0:58:24|0:58:32|Zhen Xuan finished speaking and his phone in his pocket rang, so he walked to the side to answer the call.
0:58:38|0:58:49|[Ye Wenwen] smiled as she watched Zhen Xuan walking away. She then turned around and asked the salesgirls beside her.
0:58:52|0:58:57|The scene cuts to the second grade class party, where Ye Wenwen is dressed in a panda costume.
0:58:57|0:59:4|He lifted the curtain on the stage and, seeing that Chen Zhenxuan was not in the audience, he cried in grievance. And at this moment
0:59:4|0:59:8|Zhen Xuan was still at home adjusting the bridal veil.
0:59:24|0:59:43|Ye Wenwen pouted and walked towards the stage, while Chen [Zhen Xuan] was still adjusting the bridal veil. The performance for the second grade class party had already begun, with Ye Wenwen dressed in a giant panda costume chasing the children playing the big bad wolf on stage, and Chen [Zhen Xuan]'s bridal veil had just been fixed.
0:59:47|0:59:57|Chen [Zhen Xuan] looked at his watch while holding his coat, then hurried to the party. The children's performance had already ended, and Yi Yi stood on the stage with a dejected expression.
1:0:10|1:0:17|Ye Wenwen sat alone in the audience seat below the stage, occasionally looking towards the door, but still did not see her father.
1:0:24|1:0:37|Ye Wenwen was absent-mindedly watching the performance on stage, staring fixedly at the entrance. Chen [Zhen Xuan] was still on the road driving, unfortunately running into a traffic jam, making the spacious road suddenly congested.
1:0:47|1:1:11|Ye Wenwen stood up from her seat, then burst into tears below the stage. She didn't respond, tears dropping one by one. At this moment, a person ran in from the door. Ye Wenwen heard the sound and turned towards the entrance, stopping her crying, looking shocked at the person walking in.
1:1:13|1:1:28|Chen [Zhen Xuan] increased the speed of the car, quickly drove to Yi Yi's school, swiftly parked the car and rushed into the teaching building. The slippers he didn't have time to change affected his pace. Finally, he arrived at the scene of the party and walked in, where he saw [Ye Wenwen] performing on stage.
1:1:40|1:2:6|[Ye Wenwen] gestured on stage, answering one question after another correctly. [Zhen Xuan] leaned against the wall by the classroom door, watching [Ye Wenwen] imitating animal performances with lively movements. He fell into contemplation, thinking of the anxious look on [Ye Wenwen]'s face as she rushed into the classroom. While appearing calm on the surface as he watched the two people laughing on stage, turmoil was already raging in his heart.
1:2:6|1:2:13|His heart was as sweet as if he had drunk honey, finally unable to suppress the joy in his heart.
1:2:13|1:2:21|He looked at the two people on the stage, a smile playing at the corners of his mouth.
1:2:21|1:2:30|The party is over, Chen [Zhen Xuan] and [Ye Wenwen] are walking on the street.
1:2:51|1:3:13|After saying that, [Ye Wenwen] stepped forward and hugged Chen [Zhen Xuan] by the neck. Chen [Zhen Xuan] took a sharp breath nervously, clearly feeling uncomfortable with this sudden hug. His hands hung in the air, body stiff, as [Ye Wenwen] let go and walked away.
1:3:25|1:3:48|After turning around and walking away, Ye Wenwen's smile gradually disappeared. Suddenly, a voice behind her called out to her, and she turned around to see Li Xiang. Chen Zhenxuan, who had left, bumped into the wall. He quickly hid behind the wall, peeking out to eavesdrop on the conversation between the two.
1:5:31|1:5:37|[Ye Wenwen] struggled hard to break free from [Li Xiang]'s embrace, she didn't want to stay a moment longer and quickly fled the scene.
1:5:38|1:5:44|Li Xiang watched as Ye Wenwen walked away, standing in place and crying. Chen Zhenxuan leaned against the wall, lost in his thoughts.
1:5:45|1:5:59|Back home, [Ye Wenwen] tossed and turned in bed, unable to fall asleep. Chen [Zhen Xuan] returned home and watched Yi Yi fall asleep. He took the half-drunk milk from her hand and drank it himself.
1:5:59|1:6:8|After finishing the remaining half bottle of milk, he glanced at the sleeping Ye Wenwen, turned off the bedside lamp, and entered his own room.
1:6:9|1:6:44|He flipped through his costume manuscript and found a family photo, which was a picture of Chen [Zhen Xuan] and his mother when he was a child. He took out the photo from the book and smiled at the crying child in the picture. Then he put the photo back in its original place. In the quiet night with a gentle breeze, [Wen Yi] was in a bathrobe in the hotel when her phone suddenly vibrated. She stopped using a towel to dry her hair.
1:6:44|1:6:48|Picking up the phone and looking at the text message sent by [Wang Yunfei].
1:6:48|1:6:54|She dropped the towel and the text message said, "Tell me your return flight number and I'll pick you up."
1:6:56|1:7:8|[Wen Yi] stood still without replying to his message. After putting down her phone and thinking quietly for a long time, she dressed up and walked on a bridge in Italy with [Li Xiang].
1:7:38|1:7:45|After they finished speaking, Li Xiang raised his arm and leaned against the pillar on the side of the road, looking affectionately at Wen Yi.
1:7:45|1:7:51|Feeling his gaze, [Wen Yi] awkwardly touched her hair.
1:8:0|1:8:8|Upon hearing this, [Wen Yi] blushed shyly, turned around, and leaned against a pillar to avoid his gaze.
1:8:46|1:8:51|Before finishing his sentence, [Li Xiang] wrapped [Wen Yi] in his arms.
1:8:53|1:9:1|He looked at [Wen Yi]'s smooth and jade-like face, her cherry-red lips, and couldn't help but feel the urge to kiss her.
1:9:1|1:9:15|He leaned forward, slowly approaching [Wen Yi]. Just as he was about to touch her, [Wen Yi] lowered her head and pushed away [Li Xiang]'s arm. She turned around to look at the distant night view, and after a moment of contemplation, she softly said:
1:9:40|1:9:50|She turned around to face [Li Xiang], her eyes filled with guilty tears.
1:9:52|1:10:21|[Li Xiang] turned his head with red eyes, unwilling to look at her. [Wen Yi] bent down and hugged [Li Xiang] for a moment before slowly letting go. [Li Xiang] hugged [Wen Yi] tightly, not wanting her to leave. [Wen Yi] cried on [Li Xiang]'s shoulder as he released his hands and gently stroked her face with his left hand. He shook his head as he looked at [Wen Yi], hoping she wouldn't refuse. He leaned forward again, longing for [Wen Yi]'s love.
1:10:21|1:10:43|[Wen Yi] still pushed away, [Li Xiang] hugged [Wen Yi] tightly who wanted to leave again. No matter how [Wen Yi] tried to push him away this time, he held on tightly, unwilling to let go. He wanted to use brute force to steady [Wen Yi]'s lips. [Wen Yi] exerted all her strength and finally broke free from his embrace. [Wen Yi] left crying.
1:10:56|1:11:9|[Li Xiang] stood still, watching as [Wen Yi] gradually moved away. The night lake was like a huge mirror, reflecting the lights on the surrounding buildings, creating a slight ripple.
1:11:9|1:11:44|The next day, during the day, [Ling Xiao]'s flight took off, flying from Beijing to Italy. He sat in the co-pilot's seat and skillfully parked the plane. The captain walked out of the cockpit, and after adjusting his seat, [Ling Xiao] didn't move. He thought for a long time, took out his phone, and the background of the phone screen was a photo of him and [Gu Xiaolei]. He opened the messaging app on his phone and sent a message to [Gu Xiaolei], saying he had arrived safely.
1:11:47|1:11:54|After finishing typing, [Zhen Xuan] hesitated to press the send button. He sighed, then lowered his head to delete the words he had just typed.
1:11:54|1:12:8|At this moment, [Gu Xiaolei] is sitting in front of the computer, looking at the information sent by the airline. The airline is inquiring whether [Gu Xiaolei] needs the ticket to Xiamen to be issued, and [Gu Xiaolei] answers yes.
1:12:17|1:12:24|[Ling Xiao] walked out of the Italian airport after landing, while at this moment [Li Xiang] was outside the airport carrying luggage.
1:12:51|1:12:58|Auntie turned around and left, leaving [Wen Yi] and [Li Xiang].
1:13:2|1:13:40|Li Xiang turned and walked to the car, opened the door, gave Wen Yi a smile, then got into the car, closed the door, started the car and drove away. Wen Yi, standing at the airport entrance, looked through the thick glass window at Li Xiang inside the car, waiting until his car disappeared at the end of the road. People were coming and going at the airport entrance, she stood there quietly, looking in the direction the car had left.
1:13:45|1:13:52|In the night in Beijing, [Tian Haixin] and [Cao Dapeng] lie on the floor of the living room.
1:14:56|1:15:25|The scene shifts, [Wen Yi] has also returned to China. She is pushing a suitcase at the airport, and Yun Fei sees her from a distance, waving to her. She walks through the crowd to Yun Fei, who smiles and gives her a hug. [Gu Xiaolei] sits at home waiting for [Ling Xiao]'s response. [Ling Xiao] witnesses a wedding in Italy, where the groom holds the bride's hand and says, "Thank you all for coming to our wedding."
1:17:29|1:17:36|Zhen Xuan put down the pen for the sketch, flexed his fingers, and then turned around and left.
1:17:36|1:18:9|[Ye Wenwen] got up from the sofa and walked to the table, picking up the sketch that Chen Zhenxuan had just drawn. The sketch on the edge of the table fell down, revealing a family photo. [Ye Wenwen] squatted down to pick up the photo, looked at it for a while, then stood up and placed the sketch on the table. She gazed at the photo again, sighed softly, and then opened the sketch, preparing to put the photo inside.
1:18:9|1:18:18|The manuscript depicts a portrait of oneself, with the words written beside it: "The most beautiful moment in my life is meeting you."
1:18:20|1:18:46|She flipped back again, still her own portrait, with the words: October 18, 2012, sunny, your smile disperses the dark clouds. She quickly flipped forward to the first page of the manuscript, where her bust, hip, and waist measurements were recorded. Flipping through, she saw various wedding dresses designed by Chen [Zhen Xuan] based on herself, flipping and flipping.
1:18:46|1:19:15|She flipped to the page where she first drew a portrait of herself. It read: "August 2, 2018, overcast. The most beautiful moment in my life is meeting you." Then she turned to the next page where another sentence was written beside the drawing: "December 24, 2012, light snow. At this moment, I returned to the greenness of first love."
1:19:16|1:19:42|Facing you, I hesitate and falter, unable to move forward. In the next page, next to the 2013 portrait, it says "I am willing to wipe away your tears forever, even if they have nothing to do with me." On the page above, it says: "My world has your presence, regardless of whether the ending is perfect, I am content."
1:19:43|1:20:15|Turning to the next page, the date is now 2014. No matter where you are, no matter how busy you are, I will be here watching over you. On the next page, it says that everything in front of you is the best arrangement. [Ye Wenwen] looked at the contents of the manuscript and tears fell from her eyes. She continued flipping through the manuscript until she came across a portrait of herself in a pure white wedding dress, with the words "Let's get married" written beside it.
1:20:15|1:20:30|[Ye Wenwen] is deeply moved at this moment, too overwhelmed to wipe away the tears streaming down her face. Her eyes are fixed on the few words next to the portrait, holding the heavy manuscript as she sits in the chair, unable to stop sobbing.
1:20:30|1:20:38|The five characters written on the painting were so eye-catching, and the white wedding dress sketch on the yellowed paper was equally striking.
1:20:38|1:20:44|[Ye Wenwen] kept looking at the art book, she didn't even notice when [Zhen Xuan] returned.
1:20:44|1:20:54|Chen [Zhen Xuan] and Yi Yi stood in the corridor, watching [Ye Wenwen] crying while holding the manuscript.
1:20:54|1:21:1|[Ye Wenwen] noticed the person behind her without turning around to face [Zhen Xuan].
1:21:1|1:21:28|She just slightly tilted her head, then closed the manuscript and placed it on the table in front of her. She got up from the chair, turned around and walked towards Chen [Zhen Xuan] and Yi Yi. Chen [Zhen Xuan] didn't look at Ye Wenwen, nor did he stop her. He let Ye Wenwen pass by him, looking at the catalog not far away, lost in his thoughts. Ye Wenwen left.
1:21:28|1:21:35|Ye Wenwen looked up, and Zhen Xuan covered Ye Wenwen's mouth, signaling him not to continue speaking.
1:21:35|1:21:54|[Ye Wenwen] returned home and sat on the floor in the living room, propping her head up with her hand as she looked at the computer on the table. The computer displayed the profile picture of the male god from the last dating personality match questionnaire. The next day came in a blink of an eye.
1:22:43|1:22:54|After saying that, [Ye Wenwen] picked up her bag and walked towards the coffee shop with a smile on her face and light steps. She finally walked out of that humble love affair.
1:22:54|1:23:6|Li Feng sat with his head down and his head drooping on the chair without moving, while [Ye Wenwen] walked out of the coffee shop, took out her phone from her bag, and dialed Chen [Zhen Xuan]'s number.
1:24:10|1:24:30|With the music playing, the camera moves to a church in Italy, the exterior of the church is very grand, with the interior walls decorated with murals. At this moment, an orchestra is performing, with [Li Xiang] dressed in a tailcoat, conducting with a baton in hand.
1:24:37|1:24:46|Fearless of such a grand scene. The music ends,
1:24:46|1:24:55|The people around all stood up and applauded the orchestra's wonderful performance. [Li Xiang] turned around on the conductor's podium and bowed deeply towards the audience.
1:25:8|1:25:29|And hoping that he would stay and join the best orchestra in Italy, [Li Xiang] said he would seriously consider it. As he looked up, he saw [Wen Yi], quickly turned to his teacher and said he needed to leave for a moment. Then he jogged after [Wen Yi] and started running fast, afraid of losing sight of [Wen Yi]. He ran a few steps through the long corridor and finally caught up with [Wen Yi].
1:25:29|1:25:36|He quickly grabbed her shoulder, but the person who turned around was not [Wen Yi], just someone who looked very much like [Wen Yi].
1:25:36|1:25:51|He quickly apologized, saying he mistook the person, then stood there with a disappointed look on his face. Meanwhile, in Beijing, [Wen Yi] was trying on wedding dresses in a bridal shop.
1:25:56|1:26:17|[Ye Wenwen] bent down to help [Wen Yi] adjust her skirt. As [Wen Yi] looked down at her skirt, she saw a figure in the mirror. When she looked up, it wasn't Wang Yunfei, but [Li Xiang].
1:26:19|1:26:50|She looked at [Li Xiang] in the mirror, but when she turned her head, [Li Xiang] turned into Wang Yunfei. She put away her smile, turned to look at herself in the mirror, and Wang Yunfei walked to Wen Yi's side to look at her. Wen Yi smiled slightly at him, and the two leaned on each other in front of the mirror. As night fell on the bustling streets of Beijing, Tian Haixin returned home from work, turned on the lights in the living room, and then turned on the lights in the hallway.
1:26:50|1:27:14|She turned around and saw the wedding photo of herself and Cao Dapeng on the wall. Walking over, she looked closely at it, her eyes couldn't help but be wet with tears. She walked to the door and opened it, unexpectedly finding that the person who came was Ye Wenwen.
1:28:20|1:28:26|[Tian Haixin] closed the door and hid behind it, crying.
1:29:8|1:29:26|[Tian Haixin] stood by the door, covering her mouth and crying non-stop. [Ye Wenwen] drove to the front of Chen Zhenxuan's house. She pressed the doorbell a few times but no one answered. Then she called Chen Zhenxuan, but still no one picked up.
1:29:29|1:29:33|She bent down unwillingly to look at Chen Zhenxuan's home.
1:29:33|1:29:42|I can't figure out why Chen Zhenxuan didn't answer my call. The next day, Ling Xiao returned to the country, and the captain looked at the display screen.
1:30:50|1:31:21|The cabin was tossed around by strong air currents, the aircraft was shaking wildly, and the cabin was in chaos. All passengers, including Li Xiang, Ling Xiao, and the captain, were in a panic. The captain and Ling Xiao were doing their best to control the aircraft's control buttons. The plane was still in a crazy turbulence state, tilting upwards and finally breaking through the thick clouds. Ling Xiao breathed a sigh of relief, and the captain calmed down.
1:31:21|1:31:32|The screams in the cabin gradually subsided, and the plane flew steadily in the air. The captain's face was covered with beads of sweat, obviously the previous situation had scared him as well.
1:31:33|1:31:35|Ling Xiao quickly executes the command.
1:31:42|1:31:52|Control center, this is Flight 556, cheers and applause erupt in the cabin outside the cockpit. [Li Xiang] is slumped in his seat, gasping for air, while the captain and [Ling Xiao] fist bump inside the cockpit.
1:31:59|1:32:9|Li Xiang in the cabin took out a photo of him and Wen Yi from his pocket and looked at it.
1:32:46|1:32:59|The captain finished speaking, crossed his arms, turned to look out the window. [Ling Xiao] lowered his head in thought for a moment, then also looked out the window, lost in his own thoughts.
1:33:1|1:33:10|The camera shifted from an aerial scene to outside the bridal shop of [Ye Wenwen]. At this moment, the city radio station was playing the program of the day.
1:33:42|1:33:52|[Ye Wenwen] sat in the shop, still unable to get through to Zhen Xuan on the phone. [Wang Yunfei] greeted the people who came to attend his own wedding, dressed in a dark suit.
1:34:6|1:34:39|[Wen Yi] casually replied, head down and gloomy, letting [Ye Wenwen] play with the veil on her head. Suddenly, she lifted her head and listened carefully when she heard the familiar tune outside. She lifted the hem of her wedding dress and ran outside, pushing open the door of the dressing room and hurried to the wedding venue. When she emerged, tears were streaming down her face. In the venue, she searched for the control panel playing the music, sliding her hands around haphazardly, trying to turn off the music.
1:34:39|1:34:44|Wang Yunfei runs over.
1:34:52|1:35:6|The music continued, but obviously it wasn't the one [Wen Yi] had heard. [Wang Yunfei] took [Wen Yi] back to the dressing room, where [Wen Yi] couldn't stop crying.
1:36:23|1:36:27|[Ling Xiao] finished talking to his colleague, walked out of the corner, took out his phone and made a call.
1:36:36|1:37:9|The phone was not answered. When [Ling Xiao] got off work, it was already evening. He drove back home, opened the porch light, then the bedroom light. The bed was neatly made. He walked out of the bedroom, turned on the kitchen light, then the living room light. He saw a letter on the sofa next to a doll, and upon reading it, he found out that [Gu Xiaolei] had resigned and left Beijing.
1:38:0|1:38:26|[Gu Xiaolei] has packed her luggage and gone to the airport. She looks back at the place where she used to work. [Ling Xiao] rushes to the airport in his car, quickly parks the car, and rushes out of the car. Meanwhile, [Gu Xiaolei] is looking at a billboard in the waiting area. Chen Zhenxuan tidies up his manuscript at home, [Ye Wenwen] walks towards a bridal shop, and [Tian Haixin] sits on the sofa at home.
1:38:26|1:38:54|[Cao Dapeng] was staring blankly in the kitchen, while [Wen Yi] was sobbing at home. [Li Xiang] stayed in the hotel, [Ling Xiao] rushed into the airport, running through the sensor door and stopping the airport patrol car by running down the stairs. He searched through various waiting rooms at the airport to find [Gu Xiaolei], almost covering the entire airport, but still did not see [Gu Xiaolei].
1:38:55|1:39:8|He anxiously bit his lip and scanned the waiting room, then he began searching around the airport. He quickly assessed the passengers boarding the plane, but still did not see the figure he was looking for.
1:39:8|1:39:35|He looked towards the corner of the waiting room where only a few passengers were standing. Then he turned to look elsewhere. After a few passengers got up and left, [Gu Xiaolei] sat in the spot they had blocked. [Ling Xiao], who didn't see the blocked [Gu Xiaolei], was still searching aimlessly at the airport. [Tian Haixin] was at home holding a phone, editing a message that read:
1:39:45|1:39:52|I now want to be a good mother more than a good employee. Thank you again. After editing the content of the message,
1:39:52|1:40:5|She didn't send it out immediately, raised her head not knowing what she was thinking, hesitated for a moment before finally clicking send. She took a deep breath, not knowing if the decision she made was right or wrong.
1:40:6|1:40:12|And at this moment, the phone suddenly rang, showing that the incoming call was from General Wu.
1:40:23|1:40:45|[Gu Xiaolei] sat on the waiting chair at the airport, looking at a photo of herself and [Ling Xiao]. The airport announcement reminded passengers that the flight to Xiamen was about to depart. [Gu Xiaolei] took off her earphones, picked up her carry-on luggage, and slowly walked towards the boarding gate. Her pace was slow, as if she was anticipating something.
1:40:46|1:40:58|She lowered her head, clutching the plane ticket in her hand. She handed the ticket to the staff, who carefully checked the information before turning around to hand it back to her. She turned around to look behind her, tears welling up in her eyes.
1:40:59|1:41:8|She entered the boarding gate, and the staff pulled up the isolation belt. [Ye Wenwen] walked in the store while talking on the phone.
1:41:55|1:42:20|Watching the two walk away, [Ye Wenwen] walked to the front desk, turned off the computer, then turned off all the lights in the store, ready to go home after work. But seeing a faint light coming from the changing room, she walked towards it, pulled back the curtain.
1:42:24|1:42:34|Inside is a very gorgeous wedding dress, with a small card on it that reads "[Ye Wenwen] customized".
1:42:36|1:42:46|She walked in, picked up the card, and looked up at the wedding dress. [Gu Xiaolei] had already boarded the plane.
1:43:11|1:43:29|She looked up at [Ling Xiao], seeing her standing there in a daze. He walked to her seat, knelt down, and took her hand holding the magazine, holding it between his hands.
1:44:59|1:45:8|Gu Xiaolei nodded vigorously with tears streaming down her face, and Ling Xiao stood up to embrace her.
1:45:8|1:45:17|Passengers in the cabin surrounded them, applauding enthusiastically.
1:45:17|1:45:26|Ling Xiao takes out a ring and puts it on Gu Xiaolei's finger. Meanwhile, Ye Wenwen is in the bridal shop at this moment.
1:45:27|1:45:51|Happily putting on the custom-made wedding dress, she lifted the hem of the skirt joyfully, spinning in place. Suddenly, the music from the film projector in the shop could be heard.
1:45:51|1:46:8|She hurriedly looked around, then turned to see Chen [Zhen Xuan] again. Chen [Zhen Xuan] was dressed in a formal suit, holding Yi Yi's hand. Yi Yi smiled and looked at [Ye Wenwen], while his other hand was hidden behind his back, holding something unknown.
1:46:8|1:46:38|Chen [Zhen Xuan] pulled Yi Yi slowly towards Ye Wenwen, his eyes fixed only on her. At this moment, Ye Wenwen's heart was racing as she stood on the stage, watching the father and son approaching. When Chen [Zhen Xuan] stepped onto the stage, he almost tripped and fell, causing Ye Wenwen to cover her mouth and laugh. Chen [Zhen Xuan] also awkwardly smiled, then he solemnly said to Ye Wenwen:
1:47:48|1:48:13|The lights in the shop suddenly turned on, and a group of people walked out from behind [Ye Wenwen]. They were all colleagues who had been with [Ye Wenwen] day and night. Colleague Xiao Zhou blew her a kiss, and [Ye Wenwen] smiled at him. She playfully kicked Chen [Zhen Xuan]'s knee from behind. Chen [Zhen Xuan] knelt down on one knee and took out a ring that he had prepared long ago from his pocket.
1:48:36|1:48:50|Ye Wenwen's tears flowed out of her eyes one by one as she looked at Chen Zhenxuan in front of her. Xiao Zhou stood beside her, mouthing the words "agreed, agreed" to her. Finally, she got Ye Wenwen's answer.
1:48:50|1:49:9|Chen [Zhen Xuan] smiled happily, he stood up and put a ring on Ye Wenwen's finger. He lowered his head and gently kissed Ye Wenwen's hand with the ring on it. Ye Yi took out something hidden behind her back, it was a family portrait that was finally filled with three people.
1:49:10|1:49:39|[Ye Wenwen] squatted down and hugged Yi Yi's head. The people around them cheered, and Chen [Zhen Xuan] reached out his hands to embrace Yi Yi and [Ye Wenwen]. The people in the shop were moved to tears by this proposal, applauding for their hard-won love. [Ye Wenwen] leaned happily in Chen [Zhen Xuan]'s arms, while at this moment [Tian Haixin] had already arrived at the hotel where she worked. She and Manager Wu took the elevator upstairs.
1:49:44|1:49:56|Seeing that Mr. Wu still hadn't spoken, [Tian Haixin] could only follow him towards the banquet hall. As they neared, [Tian Haixin] stopped in his tracks.
1:49:57|1:50:18|She looked at the people in the banquet hall and then turned to look at General Wu. General Wu gestured with one hand for her to come in. The waiters inside smiled at him as she walked into the banquet hall and saw her father-in-law, mother-in-law, and her own mother standing on the side, everyone smiling at her.
1:50:31|1:50:47|Mom pulled her hand through the crowd in the banquet hall, the crowd parted layer by layer to reveal [Cao Dapeng] inside. [Cao Dapeng] stood upright in a suit with his hands behind his back, and Mom tugged at [Tian Haixin].
1:50:49|1:51:11|Tian Haixin broke free from her mother's hand, Cao Dapeng, seeing this, took the microphone and walked towards her. He then took her hand and walked to the center of the banquet hall. Tian Haixin did not refuse, keeping her head down, looking at the ground. She allowed Cao Dapeng to lead her forward, as he raised the microphone.
1:54:20|1:54:34|After speaking, he knelt down on one knee and picked up a pair of baby shoes.
1:54:37|1:54:44|Tian Haixin laughed at the baby shoes, dropped her handbag, and took the baby shoes from [Cao Dapeng]'s hands.
1:55:38|1:55:54|Relatives and friends slowly walked into the wedding venue, taking their seats in the audience area and waiting for the wedding to begin. At this moment, [Cao Dapeng] was gently caressing [Tian Haixin]'s belly, which had grown a little in the past two months.
1:56:34|1:56:54|[Wen Yi] left the bustling wedding venue and walked towards the nearby lake. Her dress and hair were gently blown by the wind, dancing in the breeze. [Gu Xiaolei] had already changed into her wedding dress and was waiting in the makeup tent for [Ye Wenwen] to help her straighten the hem of the dress.
1:56:56|1:57:7|Chen [Zhen Xuan] stood by, fiddling with the hem of [Gu Xiaolei]'s wedding dress, then ran behind her to examine the veil closely. He then bent down and fiddled with something around [Gu Xiaolei]'s waist.
1:57:7|1:57:14|[Ye Wenwen] pushed his hand away with one hand.
1:57:18|1:57:24|After he finished checking the wedding dress by bending down, [Ye Wenwen] couldn't help but laugh at his actions.
1:57:46|1:57:53|[Wen Yi] sat alone on a bench by the lake, listening to the commentary at the wedding venue.
