0:2:15|0:2:33|In the second round, [Ai Disheng] quickly got up and kicked down the rushing Little Teddy. The handsome man in the audience seat was dumbfounded, stretching his arms outside the ring silently shouting. The timer showed a countdown of 5 seconds, and Little Teddy was pressed to the ground by [Ai Disheng], completely powerless to fight back.
0:2:33|0:2:57|All the audience cheered, while the seductive man watched the beaten Teddy in distress, his makeup smudged from crying. In the last second, the seductive man finally accepted his fate and chose to pay Ai Disheng. Upon hearing this, Ai Disheng deliberately shifted his fist to the right, then used his other fist to hit Teddy's elbow. Teddy's arm happened to hit Ai Disheng's left cheek, causing Ai Disheng to turn his head and fall to the ground.
0:2:57|0:3:5|The crowd erupted in cheers as the referee announced Ai Disheng's victory. Ma Dong, seeing this, immediately rushed up to hug Ai Disheng and celebrate loudly.
0:3:5|0:3:13|Ai Disheng, lying on the ground, then quietly stood up, smiling as he stood below the stage and took the 10,000 yuan handed to him by the seductive man.
0:3:26|0:3:34|[Ai Disheng] picked up the bag and ran outside, then rode a motorcycle all the way, while the female journalist [Ma Xiao] was walking around the office building.
0:3:58|0:4:2|[Ma Xiao] answered his subordinates' questions while walking downstairs.
0:4:12|0:4:17|The female employee handed the documents to [Ma Xiao], then smiled and walked away. [Ma Xiao] looked through the documents in her hand.
0:4:17|0:4:26|At the end of one page, Ai Disheng was seen. Her expression suddenly became puzzled, and at that moment, Director Diao suddenly appeared and knocked on the glass behind Ma Xiao.
0:4:26|0:4:33|He flirted with [Ma Xiao] with a smile on his face, then took two steps forward, leaned against the glass and made a shouting gesture.
0:4:33|0:4:42|Ai Disheng saw the three words "I love you" written on the corner of his mouth. Seeing this, [Ma Xiao] smiled and then turned around to pick up a pen and drew a few strokes on the glass.
0:4:42|0:4:45|Director Diao, who was lying on the glass, was painted as a Calabash Brother.
0:4:45|0:4:53|[Ma Xiao] finished painting and turned around without hesitation, leaving the office and following the assistant to the hall for the UFK weighing ceremony.
0:5:36|0:5:42|[Ma Xiao] sharpens the microphone and asks questions, while [Ai Disheng] stands awkwardly on the stage with his bare arms.
0:6:4|0:6:33|[Wu Liang] appeared in a suit and sunglasses, causing a stir in the audience. He walked elegantly towards [Ai Disheng], took off his sunglasses slowly, and [Ai Disheng], who was glaring fiercely at [Ma Xiao] moments ago, suddenly softened and his expression became ingratiating.
0:7:36|0:7:44|[Ai Disheng] followed [Ma Dong] downstairs, and [Ma Xiao] happened to arrive at the staircase as well.
0:8:21|0:8:43|[Ma Xiao] eavesdropped on [Ai Disheng] and [Ma Dong] while taking out a recording pen to capture their conversation. However, the phone suddenly rang, causing the recording pen to drop in front of [Ai Disheng]. He picked it up and glanced at it, then looked up with [Ma Dong], only to see [Ma Xiao] casually approaching them. She picked up the recording pen from [Ai Disheng] and walked away as if nothing had happened.
0:9:26|0:9:42|[Ai Disheng] rushed up to snatch the recorder from [Ma Xiao]'s hand. [Ma Xiao] pushed hard and ran away. [Ai Disheng] accidentally knocked down [Ma Dong] behind him. [Ma Dong] rolled down the stairs, his face filled with pain. [Ai Disheng] chased after [Ma Xiao] towards the exit, following him all the way to the rooftop next to the pool under maintenance.
0:9:58|0:10:22|[Ma Xiao] accidentally stepped into a small hole next to the swimming pool, her heel broke, and her body leaned back towards the pool. Seeing this, [Ai Disheng] hurried forward to hold her waist, and the two fell backwards together. Their lips also met due to inertia at this moment. Suddenly, thunder sounded in the sky, a lightning bolt struck down, hitting the two in the pool. Both of them were struck by lightning, and they both fainted, floating on the surface of the water.
0:10:22|0:10:31|The screen now shows the cast and crew list, with the boxer [Ai Disheng] played by Alan, and the renowned sports journalist [Ma Xiao] played by Mary.
0:10:31|0:10:43|Ma Xiao's father Ma Dong, played by Tian Yu, the deputy head of the Juanlian Gate Zhang Zhuyu, played by Shen Teng, Ma Xiao's fianc√©, the boxing champion Wu Liang, played by Xue Haowen, and Wu Liang's father Wu De, played by Lin Wei.
0:10:44|0:10:54|The title "The Enigma of Arrival" appeared on the screen at this moment, and a pair of happy enemies, with their minds wide open, began their sweet love story.
0:10:55|0:11:3|[Ai Disheng] and [Ma Xiao] were rescued and taken to the hospital. [Ai Disheng] woke up alone in the hospital bed, and the first thing he did was to touch his chest.
0:11:22|0:11:45|He lifted the blanket and glanced at his crotch, [Ai Disheng] frowned and covered his mouth. He finally realized something was wrong, picked up the mirror next to him, and was surprised to find that he had actually turned into [Ma Xiao]. He and [Ma Xiao] had swapped bodies.
0:12:10|0:12:25|[Ai Disheng] rushed out of the ward, searching for [Ma Xiao] in the hospital corridor. At the same time, [Ma Xiao], who was carrying [Ai Disheng]'s body, was also tearfully looking for [Ai Disheng]. When [Ai Disheng] looked up, he saw [Ma Xiao] on the opposite floor. She quickly shouted out.
0:13:20|0:13:28|[Ai Disheng] finally realized that he was currently wearing [Ma Xiao]'s face, took a deep breath and immediately changed his attitude.
0:13:47|0:13:55|[Ai Disheng] pulled [Ma Xiao] over and pushed her into a corner, while [Ma Xiao] cried and rubbed the swollen side of her face in grievance.
0:14:4|0:14:11|At this moment, the hospital security guard walked by with an electric baton. Suddenly, they had an idea and then carried a large bag of electric batons back to the edge of the pool.
0:15:10|0:15:19|[Ma Xiao] hesitated for a moment, but eventually agreed. [Ai Disheng] leaned towards [Ma Xiao], preparing to kiss her, only to be slapped and knocked to the ground by [Ma Xiao].
0:15:39|0:15:47|[Ma Xiao] was shocked and weakened by the electricity. She struggled to crawl to the side of the sofa and took out her phone to check.
0:16:30|0:16:43|[Ma Dong] was instantly stunned. With a face full of disbelief, he stood still for a while, then fiercely slapped himself. He sat on the ground, covering his face, crying and saying.
0:17:41|0:17:45|Ma Xiao reached out to stop [Ai Disheng] from speaking, but after a while, gave up.
0:17:45|0:17:48|[Ma Dong] turned around and pointed at [Ai Disheng] with chopsticks.
0:18:32|0:18:38|[Ma Dong] pushed [Ma Xiao], and [Ma Xiao] immediately stood up and glared at him.
0:18:57|0:19:3|[Ma Xiao] looked frustrated and walked out with a sigh.
0:20:1|0:20:17|In the midst of the commotion, [Ma Xiao] returned to her own home and stood in the bathroom to take a shower. Confronted with this unfamiliar body, her face was filled with disgust. After a moment, she put on leather gloves, held a pair of tongs in one hand, and a brush in the other to start cleaning her body.
0:20:17|0:20:24|After taking a shower, [Ma Xiao] stood in front of the mirror with [Ai Disheng]'s body trying on clothes, striking various seductive poses.
0:20:45|0:20:56|[Ai Disheng] in a white bathrobe, raised an eyebrow and pushed open the door of the women's bathhouse. Inside, there were women bathing, wiping their bodies and shaking their wet hair, all turning to look at the sudden intrusion of [Ai Disheng].
0:21:22|0:21:30|[Ai Disheng] emerged from the bathroom, dressed and whistling.
0:21:31|0:21:39|[Ma Xiao] frowned and glared at the door, then raised the small iron pot in her hand as she saw [Ai Disheng] coming out of the bathroom.
0:21:44|0:21:47|[Ai Disheng] ran away quickly, while [Ma Xiao] waved vigorously.
0:21:47|0:21:56|Directly smash [Ai Disheng] into the cement pit in front with a small iron pot.
0:22:10|0:22:37|[Ma Xiao] picked up her phone and saw that it was Xiaomaodan calling. Before she could answer, there was a knock on the door. Panicked, [Ma Xiao] hurried into the house and then hid in the closet. [Ai Disheng], wrapped in a towel and barefoot, walked out to open the door. Standing outside was [Director Diao] holding a bouquet of flowers.
0:22:46|0:23:4|Director Diao stared blankly at Ai Disheng, who was shirtless, and quickly wrapped himself in a towel. Ma Xiao in the closet sighed helplessly. Director Diao threw away the flowers in his hand.
0:23:32|0:23:46|Director Diao turned and ran into the room, then also hid in the wardrobe. When he turned around, he unexpectedly found Ma Xiao in the same wardrobe. Ai Disheng imitated Ma Xiao's shy posture.
0:24:12|0:24:25|[Ma Xiao] pushed [Director Diao] out of the wardrobe with force, causing him to fall awkwardly on the ground. [Wu Liang] was momentarily stunned by the unfamiliar man in front of him. [Director Diao] got up from the ground, forced a smile, and walked up to [Wu Liang], shaking his hand.
0:24:27|0:24:34|He shook hands and was about to run, but was pulled back by [Wu Liang]. [Ai Disheng] smiled and looked at [Director Diao], who swallowed nervously.
0:24:42|0:24:51|[Ai Disheng] was stunned for a moment, then quickly covered his face, ran to the sofa and started pretending to be pitiful.
0:25:14|0:25:23|Director Diao hadn't finished speaking when, in the blink of an eye, he was thrown down from the second floor by Wu Liang.
0:25:26|0:25:31|[Ai Disheng] put on an innocent look, pretending to be clueless.
0:25:55|0:26:4|The real [Ma Xiao] rushed out of the cabinet and threw [Ma Xiao] off the balcony.
0:26:4|0:26:10|The ambulance arrived, and Director Diao lay in the car, covered in bandages from head to toe.
0:27:52|0:28:13|[Ma Xiao] dared not attack with his bitter face, so Wei Xiang threw punches and knocked him down. [Ma Xiao] raised his hands in a surrender gesture, while Dong Ge and [Ai Disheng] covered their faces helplessly in the audience. Only then did [Ma Xiao] realize what was happening and rushed towards Wei Xiang.
0:28:44|0:28:58|The commentator was completely shocked, Wei Xiang was also stunned, [Ma Xiao] saw this and ran away, with Wei Xiang chasing after her on the stage. [Ai Disheng] looked disgusted, and suddenly the referee announced there were 10 seconds left.
0:29:8|0:29:15|[Ma Xiao] dodged on stage, but not only did he fail to avoid Wei Xiang's fist, he was hit squarely by the opponent. Wei Xiang looked completely stunned as he watched [Ma Xiao] fall to the ground.
0:29:15|0:29:21|While [Ma Xiao] had a face full of bruises, she sat on the ground and started crying in grievance.
0:29:28|0:29:44|The referee stopped the match. [Ma Xiao] left the boxing ring and continued crying on the steps. Reporters surrounded her taking photos, while [Ai Disheng] had a face full of anger.
0:30:7|0:30:16|[Ai Disheng] actually pulled off Li Bingqiang's underwear in front of the camera, leaving [Ma Xiao] fuming at [Ai Disheng]'s actions.
0:31:5|0:31:20|[Ai Disheng] actually hanged himself at the competition venue, with his naked body hanging in the air and a cardboard hanging around his neck with the words "defeated and disgraced" written on it. This absurd scene later turned into a picture in the newspaper, with the headline "Boxer [Ai Disheng] commits suicide in shame after consecutive defeats".
0:31:20|0:31:29|On the other side, Wu Liang walked into the mansion and stood in front of his father Wu De. Wu De held up a newspaper reporting Ai Disheng's suicide, and sternly lectured his son.
0:31:33|0:31:37|[Wu De] threw the newspaper on the coffee table and left, [Wu Liang] picked up the newspaper and glanced at it.
0:31:37|0:31:40|Then he bunched it up, revealing a fierce expression on his face.
0:31:40|0:31:46|The scene cuts to [Ai Disheng] cheerfully taking out his salary from a box.
0:31:54|0:31:59|[Ai Disheng] threw the box in his hand into the trash can, and saw [Ma Xiao] standing with a serious expression on the side.
0:32:10|0:32:28|Two people were quarreling on the roadside, and a van came and took away [Ma Xiao]. [Ai Disheng] was stunned and quickly rode a motorcycle to chase after them. [Wu Liang]'s two subordinates took [Ma Xiao] to a mansion, where she walked forward calmly. [Ai Disheng] followed sneakily, and the security guard at the door was shocked to see him and immediately greeted him.
0:32:30|0:32:44|In the room, [Ma Xiao] has now arrived in front of [Wu Liang]. The boss [Ma Dong] has fled, only [Ai Disheng] was caught. [Ma Xiao] rolled her eyes and spoke again.
0:32:52|0:33:1|[Ma Xiao] was shocked, looking at [Wu Liang] who was drinking.
0:33:12|0:33:30|[Ma Xiao] looked up and saw a woman in pajamas coming down the stairs. She sat in front of [Wu Liang] with her hair loose, reached out and hugged [Wu Liang]'s neck. The face of [Ai Disheng] hiding at the door was full of gossip. [Wu Liang] gestured for the beauty to leave, but [Ma Xiao] angrily intercepted the beauty who was about to leave.
0:33:30|0:33:39|[Ma Xiao] pushed [Wu Liang] away and sat on the sofa with a stern face, crossing his legs and said,
0:33:39|0:33:48|Glancing back at the beauty and then at the angry [Ma Xiao], she felt extremely puzzled.
0:34:29|0:34:51|Wu Liang turned around in astonishment to look at Ma Xiao. Ma Xiao, crying and glaring at Wu Liang, raised her hand as if to slap him. Wu Liang grabbed Ma Xiao's hand and threw her onto the sofa. Ma Xiao covered her face and cried in pain.
0:34:53|0:35:1|[Ai Disheng] suddenly rushed in and kicked [Wu Liang] from behind.
0:35:10|0:35:19|Hearing Ai Disheng turned around and looked at the crying Ma Xiao.
0:35:38|0:35:47|[Ma Xiao] bent over and signed on the contract, [Ai Disheng] picked up the contract and looked at it, and he was completely stunned.
0:36:19|0:36:27|[Ai Disheng] glanced at [Ma Dong] and raised the contract.
0:36:51|0:36:57|The waiter happened to bring a sand pot at this moment, and [Ma Xiao]'s fist was very small compared to the pot.
0:37:26|0:37:34|[Ai Disheng] looked at the frantic [Ma Xiao], rubbed his head helplessly, and saw [Ma Xiao] take a few steps back and say to a female audience member.
0:37:42|0:37:58|[Ma Xiao] walked into the arena with her head held high and proud, then bounced around in circles to warm up. The referee next to her helplessly watched with hands on hips. After a few rounds of warm-up, [Ma Xiao] stood in front of her opponent, raised her arms for a stretch, took a few steps forward, and then confidently taunted her opponent.
0:38:1|0:38:6|The opponent looked at [Ma Xiao] with a contemptuous expression, silently twisting his neck.
0:38:14|0:38:19|[Ma Xiao] shouted and launched an attack, but was knocked out by a punch from the opponent.
0:38:19|0:38:25|After one match ended, [Ma Xiao] immediately went to another boxing ring and was once again brutally beaten down by a powerful opponent.
0:38:27|0:38:49|At this moment, [Ai Disheng] walked over with a drink, looking at the exhausted [Ma Xiao]. Despite [Ma Xiao]'s persistence in continuing training, [Ai Disheng] nodded helplessly. [Ma Xiao] repeatedly mustered up the courage to attack, only to be humiliated and beaten by the opponent countless times. In the end, even the food [Wu De] had eaten was punched out of his nose.
0:38:49|0:38:57|She sat gloomily at the entrance of the martial arts school with a green and purple face, and [Ai Disheng] walked out and handed her a lunch box.
0:39:22|0:39:31|[Ma Xiao] picked up the phone and glanced at it, then handed it to [Ai Disheng]. [Ai Disheng] took the phone and put it on speakerphone.
0:39:55|0:40:0|On the phone, [Ma Dong] squatted at the dock making a call, when suddenly several men in black surrounded him.
0:40:11|0:40:25|[Ma Xiao] heard the noise on the phone, handed the boxed meal to [Ai Disheng], and ran away. On the other side, [Wu Liang] was taken to a hot pot restaurant, where he was eating hot pot.
0:40:36|0:40:46|[Ma Dong] placed the gold chain from his neck on the table, without a word, [Wu Liang]'s henchman kicked [Ma Dong]'s chair away. [Wu Liang] then threw the gold chain into the boiling hot pot.
0:40:48|0:40:58|[Ma Dong] struggles to get up from the ground, looking at the cold-faced [Wu Liang], he reaches out his hand intending to use chopsticks to pick out the gold chain. [Ma Dong] is pressed down on the table by his henchman, his hand is held by the other party and sent into the pot.
0:41:3|0:41:10|[Ma Dong] begged for mercy in the hotpot restaurant, while [Ai Disheng] and [Ma Xiao] arrived at the scene. The henchmen stopped [Ai Disheng] and only let [Ma Xiao] in.
0:41:11|0:41:18|[Ma Xiao] ran into the store and saw [Ma Dong] with his back to her, kneeling on the table.
0:41:23|0:41:32|Wu Liang's younger brother turned Ma Dong around, only to see Ma Dong with a face full of injuries from the beating. Ma Xiao rushed up to check Ma Dong's injuries, but was stopped by Wu Liang's younger brother.
0:42:0|0:42:6|[Wu Liang] stood up with a smile and looked at [Ma Xiao]. The scene cut back to the previous match, where [Wu Liang] intentionally twisted [Ai Disheng]'s arm, but [Ai Disheng] refused to give up.
0:42:35|0:42:41|[Ai Disheng] was surrounded by reporters asking about bribing [Wu Liang], he was very angry but remained silent.
0:42:44|0:42:58|[Wu Liang] deliberately spun the table that [Ma Dong] was kneeling on, causing [Ma Dong] to feel dizzy. [Wu Liang] then walked up to [Ma Xiao] and whispered in her ear.
0:42:59|0:43:7|[Wu Liang]'s eyes were full of pride.
0:43:12|0:43:31|The scene shifts back a few years, with [Wu Liang] drinking red wine on the side as [Ai Disheng] unzips the travel bag, revealing a bag full of money inside. [Wu Liang] raises his hand to pick up two stacks of money, then throws them back in. The surveillance camera on the ceiling captures this moment.
0:43:32|0:43:41|The scene cuts back to the hotpot restaurant, with [Ai Disheng] carrying [Ma Xiao] on his back, who doesn't react to [Wu Liang]'s words for a while.
0:43:51|0:43:57|Facing the sarcasm from [Wu Liang], [Ma Xiao] stood by without any reaction, her face filled with surprise and regret.
0:43:57|0:44:6|[Wu Liang] walked past [Ma Xiao] and out the door, while outside the door, [Ai Disheng], who was being blocked by [Ma Xiao]'s body, was pacing anxiously in place. [Wu Liang] walked to the door and saw him.
0:44:12|0:44:18|[Wu Liang] left after speaking. [Ai Disheng] rushed into the hotpot restaurant, and [Ma Xiao] helped [Wu De] down from the dining table.
0:45:37|0:45:46|They walked in with smiles, looking at the people in front of them. Then [Ai Disheng] spoke up,
0:45:46|0:45:53|The person in front turned around, and it turned out to be a man. [Ai Disheng] quickly changed his words.
0:45:54|0:46:2|The man with long hair, named Xiu Nian, raised the ladle in his hand and took a sip of water. He poured the remaining water into the bucket and then spoke,
0:46:10|0:46:30|Three people looked up together, only to see a man dressed in black traditional Chinese clothing, hands behind his back, slowly walking out. He looked down at the three below with a slight smile, then kicked the stone railing on the second floor with his foot. As one leg bent and the other stood straight, he lost his balance the moment he landed and knelt directly in front of [Ai Disheng] and [Ma Xiao].
0:46:40|0:46:57|Hastily bending down to help Xiunian, Ai Disheng quickly lowered his head to apologize. Zhang Zhuyu called out to them.
0:47:22|0:47:32|[Ma Dong] suddenly appeared at the entrance of Juanlian Gate, and [Zhang Zhuyu] was stunned at the sight of him.
0:48:10|0:48:32|[Ma Xiao] took the advertisement paper from [Ai Disheng], who looked at the swiftly passing vehicles with a troubled expression. Xiu Nian turned sideways, performing a side flip onto the steps in front of [Ai Disheng] and [Ma Xiao]. With his flowing long hair swaying in the air, he elegantly snatched the advertisement paper from [Ma Xiao]'s hand and stepped into the middle of the road. Countless vehicles quickly passed by him.
0:48:32|0:48:49|Ai Disheng tossed the advertisement paper into the air, and the paper scattered everywhere. He then started running swiftly on the road, leaped up, gracefully caught one advertisement paper with his hand, held another one in his mouth, and flew towards the big truck.
0:48:57|0:49:5|He lay motionless on the ground, everyone was stunned, [Ai Disheng] slowly walked forward, wanting to help Xiunian.
0:49:7|0:49:15|When [Ai Disheng] tried to go over, a car ran over Xiunian, and Xiunian was completely gone.
0:49:20|0:49:33|In the auditorium, yellow and white chrysanthemums were placed, and Xiu Nian's memorial photo was placed in front of the flower wreath. [Zhang Zhuyu] walked up to the front and burned a few sticks of incense in the cup.
0:49:41|0:49:47|[Ai Disheng], along with two others, stood behind with sorrow on their faces. As night fell, [Ai Disheng] was inside the house packing up clothes.
0:50:0|0:50:24|[Ma Xiao] hesitated as she looked at [Ai Disheng], then spoke. [Ai Disheng] suddenly stopped packing and stood there blankly, then turned to look at [Ma Xiao]. [Ma Xiao] told the truth to [Ai Disheng], and the two of them drank beer together in the yard.
0:50:38|0:50:44|[Ai Disheng] smiled and clinked glasses with [Ma Xiao], and soon the floor was littered with empty bottles.
0:53:36|0:53:42|[Ma Xiao] covered her mouth.
0:54:4|0:54:10|Playing in the yard, as the sky gradually brightens, [Zhang Zhuyu] lies alone in the yard.
0:54:14|0:54:22|[Zhang Zhuyu] suddenly opened her eyes,
0:54:28|0:54:52|[Zhang Zhuyu] shook her head with a mysterious expression, then raised her arm and pointed upwards. The sunlight shone through the cracks and [Ai Disheng] and the others looked up while standing under the tree. [Zhang Zhuyu] put two fingers into her mouth and whistled. Suddenly, an owl swooped down from the sky and perched on a tree trunk, looking down at the people below.
0:55:17|0:55:24|[Ma Xiao] was frightened by [Zhang Zhuyu]'s words, [Ai Disheng] turned around to encourage her.
0:56:11|0:56:26|[Ai Disheng] and [Ma Xiao] were hovering in place, no matter what they did, their eyes never left the owl in front of them. The dark circles under their eyes became heavier, and their expressions became more haggard. Suddenly, the owl flapped a few times and looked like it was about to fall.
0:56:38|0:56:58|Two people stared fiercely at the owl, as the sky gradually brightened. While [Ma Dong] fought against the python behind them, [Ai Disheng] and [Ma Xiao] continued to confront the owl, paying no attention to what was happening outside the window. With dark circles under their eyes, their eyes gradually narrowed, and it seemed like they couldn't hold on any longer.
0:57:2|0:57:26|As soon as the words fell, the owl fell from the tree trunk. The two of them were instantly alert. [Ma Xiao] turned around to look for [Ma Dong], only to see a big python with a swollen belly on the ground. Suddenly, [Ma Dong] ran over from the side holding a chair.
0:57:35|0:57:42|In front of the wreath in the auditorium, the portrait of the owl was placed next to [Zhang Zhuyu]. [Zhang Zhuyu] lit incense, while the other disciples burned paper and cried.
0:58:1|0:58:10|All the people gathered by the river, disciples of the alliance demonstrated for [Ai Disheng] and [Ma Xiao], one person picked up fish from the river, and the other person put the fish into the basket.
0:58:18|0:58:26|Ai Disheng and Ma Xiao next to each other burst into laughter upon hearing this, then they started training. At first, Ai Disheng was picking fish from the river, and Ma Xiao couldn't hit the target no matter what.
0:58:42|0:59:12|[Ai Disheng] hit the target one after another, dancing in the river and accidentally falling down. Thinking his daughter was in danger, [Ma Dong] jumped into the river, only to find [Ai Disheng] sitting on the ground. [Ma Dong] was swept away by the river instead. [Ai Disheng] nodded in response, while [Ma Xiao] stood aside with a mournful face. [Zhang Zhuyu] sighed and then took out a black and white photo of [Ma Dong] from behind.
0:59:24|0:59:46|[Ai Disheng] and [Ma Xiao] heard the news and immediately ran outside. The photo slipped from [Zhang Zhuyu]'s hands as they ran, and they shouted as they ran towards [Ma Dong], who was shivering by the door. He then raised his arm and pointed to the side, where a couple was seen under the peach tree.
1:0:8|1:0:22|The man winked playfully at the people in front of the Juelian Gate, then raised his hand to embrace his girlfriend and left. [Zhang Zhuyu] led everyone to watch them leave, while [Ma Dong] returned to the house. He was shivering under the blanket, but there was a smile on his face.
1:0:22|1:0:28|[Ai Disheng] sat on the side stirring the hot porridge that had just been cooked.
1:0:35|1:0:47|[Ai Disheng] fed the steaming porridge to [Ma Dong]. The real [Ma Xiao] walked over, and [Ai Disheng] handed the porridge to [Ma Xiao].
1:0:47|1:0:56|[Ma Dong] was not happy to see this, still unaware that his daughter's soul was living inside [Ai Disheng]'s body. [Ma Xiao] picked up the porridge, blew on it, and handed it to [Ma Dong].
1:0:57|1:1:32|Dong intentionally turned his head to the side, refusing to drink the porridge. Reluctantly, he opened his mouth and drank the porridge handed to him by [Ma Xiao], while his eyes were fixed on [Ai Disheng] beside him. [Ai Disheng] watched as [Ma Xiao] fed Dong the porridge, then playfully opened his mouth as well. [Ma Xiao] glanced at [Ai Disheng], scooped up a spoonful of porridge and brought it to [Ai Disheng]'s mouth. Immediately after, she turned and fed the porridge to Dong. The three of them laughed happily in the room. Dong quickly recovered his health, and the group set out on the highway once again.
1:1:44|1:1:57|[Ai Disheng] and [Ma Xiao] confidently walked to the middle of the road, then ran towards the roadside the next second. The two of them tried to insert the advertisement paper in their hands onto the passing vehicles when they reached the middle of the road, but failed.
1:2:46|1:2:53|Outside, Ai Disheng and Ma Xiao are still practicing boxing, playing around with each other. Their relationship is gradually warming up. Dong Ge tightly closes the door, as if avoiding something.
1:3:25|1:3:38|[Ma Xiao] took a step back and effortlessly placed the advertisement paper on the car door. [Ma Xiao] happily ran to the roadside, picked up [Ai Disheng], and spun around with joy. They came to the middle of the road together, reciting the ad lines while inserting the advertisement onto the car.
1:3:48|1:3:53|The training is finally coming to an end, [Ma Xiao] is ready to graduate, and [Zhang Zhuyu] walks over to look at him with satisfaction.
1:4:8|1:4:15|[Ma Xiao] knocked [Zhang Zhuyu] down with one punch.
1:5:5|1:5:31|[Ai Disheng] and [Ma Xiao] showed expressions of admiration, [Zhang Zhuyu] opened her arms and raised her hands above her head, then pressed her arms down, placing her right hand on her left hand, extending her left hand forward under her arm, flicking her index finger a few times in a provocative gesture, shouting, [Zhang Zhuyu] maintained the provocative gesture, everyone turned their heads back, but there was no one behind them, then they turned back to look at [Zhang Zhuyu],
1:5:31|1:5:42|He exhaled a breath and then lowered his hands.
1:5:54|1:5:56|[Ai Disheng] confidently walks down the mountain with a backpack on his back.
1:6:20|1:6:33|As soon as the words fell, [Ma Xiao] on the boxing ring kicked down the opponent in seconds, leaving the two commentators stunned. Cheers erupted from the audience below, while the referee quickly checked on the condition of the defeated fighter and then announced [Ma Xiao] as the winner.
1:6:33|1:6:41|Ma Dong and Ai Disheng jumped up happily, while Ma Xiao couldn't believe that she had actually won.
1:7:41|1:7:56|The sudden interruption of the playfulness between [Ai Disheng] and [Ma Xiao] was caused by [Wu Liang] looking for [Ai Disheng]. As they entered the room together, [Wu Liang] was drinking red wine by the window. While drinking, he turned around and said,
1:8:56|1:9:5|[Ma Xiao] and Ken's match is about to begin, [Wu Liang] stands by the French window watching the match. [Ma Xiao] looks back at [Ai Disheng], Ken suddenly rushes forward. [Ma Xiao] swiftly turns around to dodge Ken's attack.
1:9:16|1:9:19|[Ma Xiao] and Ken were together, and Ken pushed [Ma Xiao] aside with force.
1:9:29|1:9:42|Ken's attacks were very fierce, [Ma Xiao] was gradually forced into a corner and kept getting hit. [Ai Disheng] anxiously stood below the stage shouting, [Ma Xiao] tried to turn the tide, but was still thrown down by Ken.
1:9:48|1:10:1|Upstairs, [Wu Liang] showed a victorious smile, while [Ai Disheng] and [Ma Dong] became increasingly anxious. On stage, [Ma Xiao] was always at a disadvantage, but [Ai Disheng] noticed Ken's weakness through observation.
1:10:6|1:10:21|[Ma Xiao] took a glance at [Ai Disheng], unhesitatingly followed the other's advice, and locked Ken's arms to the ground. Ken struggled with all his might to break free from [Ma Xiao]'s restraint, but [Ma Xiao] was not giving up. He lifted Ken and slammed him against the fence.
1:10:28|1:10:33|[Ma Xiao] desperately pins Ken to the ground, while Ken keeps struggling.
1:10:44|1:10:53|[Ai Disheng] lifted the lock that was chained to himself and slammed it heavily against the fence.
1:11:57|1:12:23|[Ai Disheng] and his group were happily driving forward when they were suddenly blocked by several cars. They had to stop the car, and just as [Ma Dong] was about to get out and settle the score, he saw a group of black-clothed men with iron rods coming down. He quickly reversed the car, only to be blocked by the cars behind him.
1:12:23|1:12:48|The group of men in black smashed the car windows while dragging [Ma Dong] out of the car. [Ai Disheng] and [Ma Xiao] got off the car and fought desperately against the men in black, with [Ai Disheng] pinning down one of them. Suddenly, [Wu Liang] struck [Ma Dong] on the head with an iron rod. As [Wu Liang] raised the rod to strike again, [Ma Xiao] hurriedly shouted to stop him.
1:12:48|1:12:55|Wu Liang's younger brother raised a stick and hit Ma Xiao's leg. Ma Xiao fell to the ground instantly. Wu Liang took a step forward and used his foot to step on Ma Xiao's head.
1:12:58|1:13:4|[Ai Disheng] took a step forward and pushed [Wu Liang] away to help [Ma Xiao] up from the ground.
1:13:25|1:13:36|[Wu Liang] pointed at [Ai Disheng] who was supporting [Ma Xiao], causing [Ma Xiao] to rush up and hit [Wu Liang], only to be punched in the stomach by the latter.
1:13:37|1:13:47|[Ai Disheng] stood dumbfounded on the side watching [Ma Xiao] being beaten up, without hesitation he rushed into the fight. His punches and kicks were quite agile, and once [Ma Dong] on the ground woke up, he joined the brawl.
1:13:54|1:14:15|[Ma Dong] pulled [Ma Xiao] and ran forward, with the men in black closely chasing behind. They passed by a pancake stand, and [Ma Dong] pushed the pancake cart towards the men in black. The men in black charged forward with sticks, but [Ma Dong] rushed towards them with blood dripping from his head. In the blink of an eye, [Ma Dong] grabbed an electric bike and ran back, and the three of them ultimately decided to split up and run in different directions.
1:14:16|1:14:35|The black-clothed men all chased after [Ma Dong], completely ignoring the other two. After shaking off the black-clothed men, [Ai Disheng] arrived at the rooftop panting with anger, with [Ma Xiao] following behind him.
1:14:51|1:14:57|[Ma Xiao] apologizes to [Ai Disheng] and pulls his hand forward.
1:14:59|1:15:23|[Ai Disheng] looked into [Ma Xiao]'s eyes, pushed her hand away, and walked away without a word. With his back to [Ma Xiao], [Ai Disheng] said without looking back.
1:15:44|1:16:6|[Ai Disheng] said nothing, turned around, tore off the paper belt around the waist of the practice dummy, smashed it in front of [Ma Xiao], forcefully threw it to the ground, and then left the rooftop alone. [Ai Disheng] went downstairs, put on a helmet, rode a motorcycle and left, leaving [Ma Xiao] standing alone on the rooftop. She silently took a few steps forward.
1:16:6|1:16:25|Bending down on the ground, picking up the paper gold belt torn by [Ai Disheng], her mind wandering, the phone rang shortly after. She took out her phone and answered the call.
1:16:31|1:16:43|The night grew darker, but the city was still brightly lit. [Ma Xiao] hung up the phone and sat on the edge of the rooftop, quietly gazing at the night view outside, as if he had lost his soul.
1:16:43|1:17:5|In the end, he made up his mind to go to [Wu Liang]'s house alone. At this moment, [Wu Liang] was forcing [Ma Dong] to practice boxing with him. With one punch, [Wu Liang] knocked [Ma Dong] to the ground, and [Ma Dong] lay there wailing uncontrollably.
1:17:9|1:17:17|[Ma Xiao] walked to the sandbag and kicked it away with one foot.
1:17:19|1:17:30|[Wu Liang] had a look of defiance on his face, but [Wu De] suddenly appeared and stopped the restless [Wu Liang]. [Wu Liang] took a slow step forward and then spoke.
1:17:57|1:18:9|[Ma Dong] struggled to his feet from the ground, leaning against the fence and gasping in pain. As the sky gradually brightened, dark clouds filled the sky, with lightning flashing across. The boxing championship was about to begin.
1:18:32|1:18:42|Sitting alone on a bench in the locker room, [Ma Xiao], with [Ai Disheng]'s body, the room was quiet as she bent over, resting her arms on her legs, deep in thought.
1:18:42|1:19:2|After a moment, as if she had made a decision, she closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and suddenly stood up and walked towards the arena. [Ma Xiao] entered the arena, the audience cheered and greeted her, but she remained indifferent.
1:19:7|1:19:12|[Ma Xiao] silently took off his T-shirt and stepped onto the boxing ring. The lights suddenly dimmed, and it turned out to be [Wu Liang] who had arrived.
1:19:13|1:19:24|The male commentator stood up excitedly and shouted, and the audience began to cheer as [Wu Liang] walked out in a tight-fitting sportswear under the gaze of the public.
1:19:34|1:19:43|[Wu Liang] took off his tight suit and handed it to the person next to him, his tattoo on his back standing out. He walked into the room with a smile, while [Ma Xiao] on the stage looked at him expressionlessly.
1:19:47|1:19:55|[Wu De] looked towards the scene on the second floor, while [Ma Dong] sat on the sofa without moving.
1:20:14|1:20:39|The first round officially begins. Inside the room of the Lotus Gate outside the arena, [Zhang Zhuyu] and her disciples sit in front of the TV. As the first round of the match starts, [Wu Liang] is full of confidence. He looks provocatively at [Ma Xiao] across from him, then initiates an attack. However, not only does he fail to hit [Ma Xiao], but he also receives several punches from the opponent. He takes a few steps back, looking at [Ma Xiao] with a frightened expression.
1:20:48|1:21:5|[Wu Liang] pushed [Ma Xiao] and threw a punch, but missed. He was once again grabbed and hit by [Ma Xiao]. [Wu De] watched the battle downstairs, his expression becoming more and more serious.
1:21:7|1:21:14|Wu Liang's nose started bleeding, Ma Xiao took the opportunity to sneak attack Wu Liang, and forcefully threw him to the ground.
1:21:20|1:21:25|On the second floor, [Ma Dong] whispered some sarcastic remarks into [Wu De]'s ear, and then the bodyguard threw [Ma Dong] onto the sofa.
1:21:32|1:21:43|Wu Liang was firmly pressed down on the ground by Ma Xiao, then lifted and slammed against the fence. Wu Liang struggled to lift his head, with Ai Disheng's body outside the fence. Suddenly, Wu Liang found strength.
1:21:46|1:21:53|[Ma Xiao] was punched and kicked by [Wu Liang], then lifted up and slammed hard to the ground, leaving [Ai Disheng] extremely anxious in the audience.
1:22:8|1:22:12|As the first round of the match enters the countdown, [Ma Xiao] is still being pinned down and beaten by [Wu Liang].
1:23:8|1:23:15|[Ai Disheng] lowered his head and kissed [Ma Xiao] on the lips, making the surrounding staff shyly avert their eyes as the screen gradually darkened.
1:23:15|1:23:22|The camera suddenly cuts from the scene of them kissing on the field back to the moment when they fell into the swimming pool and had their first accidental kiss.
1:23:34|1:23:55|The scene returns to the competition venue, where [Ai Disheng] and [Ma Xiao] are still kissing as if no one else is around. Outside, there is thunder and lightning, and a bolt of lightning suddenly strikes down, following the hall's wiring and shocking the two kissing. They shudder, and the lights in the hall flicker on and off. [Ai Disheng] and [Ma Xiao] finally end this long kiss.
1:23:55|1:24:13|[Ai Disheng] blinked and moved his body while sitting in the chair, [Ma Xiao] stood up, covering his lips, and then touched his face and body. They suddenly realized that their bodies had switched back.
1:24:17|1:24:23|[Ai Disheng] stood up excitedly and hugged [Ma Xiao] who was speaking. The two referees beside them silently shifted their bodies to the other side.
1:24:23|1:24:34|[Ai Disheng] helps [Ma Xiao] sit down, and [Ma Xiao] reaches out to touch [Ai Disheng]'s face.
1:24:37|1:24:42|[Ai Disheng] put the mouthguard in his mouth, took a few steps forward, and looked at [Wu Liang] with a murderous expression.
1:24:52|1:25:1|[Wu Liang] took the initiative to launch an attack, [Ai Disheng] raised his left arm to block, successfully resolving the strike. Then he turned the tables and launched a counterattack.
1:25:1|1:25:9|Outside the fence, [Ma Xiao] looked at the handsome [Ai Disheng] with a smile on his face. [Ai Disheng] dodged [Wu Liang]'s attacks one after another, and landed a punch on his face.
1:25:14|1:25:22|On the second floor, [Ma Dong] wanted to cheer but dared not make a sound. Downstairs, [Ai Disheng] seized the opportunity and picked up [Wu Liang], throwing him to the ground.
1:25:38|1:26:1|Seeing that victory was hopeless, [Wu Liang] took advantage of everyone's inattention and secretly twisted [Ai Disheng]'s fingers. Despite the pain, [Ai Disheng] persisted and refused to let go. Seeing this from the sidelines, [Ma Xiao] quickly shouted out. The referee saw [Wu Liang] twisting fingers but pretended not to notice and walked away. [Ma Xiao] was very angry. [Wu Liang] continued to twist [Ai Disheng]'s fingers forcefully, but eventually, [Ai Disheng] managed to break free.
1:26:5|1:26:20|[Wu Liang] seized the opportunity to press [Ai Disheng] down, turning the tables from offense to defense. Time and time again, [Ai Disheng] was knocked to the ground by [Wu Liang], falling into a passive position. [Wu Liang] deliberately targeted the injured left arm of [Ai Disheng].
1:26:29|1:26:35|At the end of the second round, [Wu Liang] still held onto [Ai Disheng]'s left arm, and the referee stepped in to separate them.
1:26:43|1:27:11|[Ai Disheng]'s vision gradually became blurred, with the commentator's voice faintly heard in his ears. He saw [Wu Liang] smiling smugly, then remembered the scene from a few years ago when [Wu Liang] broke his own left arm. [Ma Xiao] came in front of [Ai Disheng], holding his face without saying a word, with a face full of heartache. [Ai Disheng] sat there covered in scars, his left eye swollen shut, blood trickling from the corner of his eye.
1:27:11|1:27:19|His left arm was severely injured and he couldn't move it, but he didn't cry out in pain. Instead, he gazed gently at [Ma Xiao] and then solemnly stood up.
1:27:22|1:27:38|[Ai Disheng] squinted his left eye and nodded firmly at the referee. His expression was determined and resolute. He took the mouthguard from the coach's hand and put it in his mouth, full of fighting spirit as he stepped onto the ring for the third round.
1:27:57|1:28:5|In the boxing ring, [Wu Liang] repeatedly attacks the injured left arm of [Ai Disheng]. Despite the intense pain, [Ai Disheng] refuses to give up and continues to grit his teeth on the ring.
1:28:14|1:28:48|Wu Liang's heavy punches landed on Ai Disheng again and again, followed by a flying kick that sent Ai Disheng flying. Ai Disheng lay on the ground in a daze as Wu Liang launched another attack. Ai Disheng lay motionless on the ground, while Ma Xiao and Ma Dong shouted from the sidelines. Wu Liang, fists raised, roared and charged towards Ai Disheng. Suddenly, an image of an owl flashed through Ai Disheng's mind, causing him to widen his right eye.
1:28:48|1:28:51|Ai Disheng transformed into an owl and stood suspended in the air.
1:28:51|1:29:10|Rushing towards [Wu Liang], he was startled by [Ai Disheng] standing still, unconsciously taking a few steps back in surprise. Everyone was shocked, and the male commentator shook his head in amazement. [Wu Liang] looked at [Ai Disheng] in front of him and spat out some saliva, mustering up the courage to launch another attack. However, each of [Wu Liang]'s attacks was cleverly avoided by [Ai Disheng].
1:29:10|1:29:14|[Ai Disheng] applied the fishing action to the arena,
1:29:21|1:29:27|[Ma Xiao] shouted happily from the audience, and the audience also cheered for [Ai Disheng].
1:29:32|1:29:42|[Wu Liang] widened his eyes and continued to launch an attack, while [Ai Disheng] activated the counterattack mode, reciting small advertisements as he fought.
1:30:18|1:30:31|[Ai Disheng] is kneeling on the ground, his right cheek against the ground, the left side of his face covered in blood. He is supporting his body with his knee and right shoulder, tightly holding his injured left arm with his right arm. He is exerting all his strength to try to stand up, attempting again and again until finally succeeding.
1:30:32|1:30:44|[Ai Disheng] stood up shakily with his left arm, then he put away his smile and deliberately made a provocative expression. He raised his right hand, extended his index finger to hook his left arm, and shouted loudly at [Wu Liang].
1:30:47|1:30:54|[Ai Disheng] angered [Wu Liang] on the opposite side, while [Ma Xiao] in the audience covered her mouth in surprise.
1:31:2|1:31:13|[Ma Xiao] watched with tears in her eyes as [Ai Disheng] stood on the stage, igniting [Wu Liang]'s anger completely. The war between the two men was about to erupt, as [Ai Disheng] and [Wu Liang] ran towards each other, delivering their final blows.
1:31:14|1:31:25|All the people on site were waiting for this moment to arrive. The male and female commentators outside the arena, [Ma Xiao] outside the railing, [Ma Dong] and [Wu De] on the second floor, the referees on the stage, everyone held their breath, quietly waiting for the final result.
1:31:25|1:31:39|In the end, [Ai Disheng] landed a punch on the side of [Wu Liang]'s face. Both of them fell to the ground. The audience below stretched their necks to look at the arena. They saw [Ai Disheng], who was originally lying on the ground, struggling to stand up, while [Wu Liang] beside him remained on the ground, completely stunned.
1:32:16|1:32:24|[Ma Xiao] cried excitedly, [Ai Disheng] used his right hand to hold her face, gently wiped away the tears on her face, and smiled as he pressed his forehead against hers.
1:32:52|1:33:5|He raised the golden belt above his head, and the audience immediately cheered. [Ma Xiao] stood by, smiling at him, while reporters surrounded them, snapping photos non-stop. [Ma Xiao] looked at the tearful [Ai Disheng] with joy, reached out to take the microphone from the host's hand, and then asked.
1:33:19|1:33:33|[Ai Disheng] threw the microphone behind him and tightly embraced the person in front of him, [Ma Xiao]. The two hugged tightly in front of everyone, while [Zhang Zhuyu] and her disciples at Juanlian Gate were still in front of the TV. [Zhang Zhuyu] turned her head and said to the disciple holding the remote control,
1:33:42|1:33:54|On the TV screen, there was only a snowflake. [Zhang Zhuyu] and her disciples rubbed their eyes helplessly as the screen turned black. Then a few lines of text appeared, saying: "For the safety of life, please do not imitate the behavior of highway advertising in the film."
1:33:54|1:34:1|The scene cuts back to the competition venue, where two police officers approach [Wu De] and hand him a piece of paper, while downstairs [Ma Xiao] watches him with a voice recorder in hand.
