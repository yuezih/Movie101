0:1:31|0:1:44|Zhang Nan's gaze was suddenly drawn to the performance, a beautiful woman in a long dress leisurely walking towards him. Zhang Nan couldn't take his eyes off her, only seeing the blurry figure of this woman in a long dress. At this moment, the girl beside him called out.
0:1:50|0:1:59|[Zhang Nan] did not hear the girl's call beside him. At this moment, the beautiful woman, dressed in simple yet occasionally gorgeous attire, with a graceful and charming figure, stood by the pool.
0:1:59|0:2:4|[Zhang Nan] is once again completely captivated.
0:2:4|0:2:8|[Zhang Nan] was bumped into by the waitress next to the beauty.
0:2:8|0:2:10|The beauty catches [Zhang Nan], and [Zhang Nan] asks.
0:2:15|0:2:22|[Zhang Nan] had just finished speaking when the beauty let go of his hand and waved at him, her eyes smiling in all directions without revealing any emotion.
0:2:27|0:2:32|After falling into the pool, Zhang Nan opened his eyes again only to find that the beauty was nowhere to be seen. On the shore, a group of people were laughing at themselves.
0:2:39|0:2:45|[Zhang Nan] looked around anxiously for the beautiful girl he had just seen, but did not see her anywhere.
0:2:45|0:2:54|A group of people on the shore watched Zhang Nan's joke, and the helpless Zhang Nan buried his head in the water, exhaling bubbles as if the scattered clouds in the clear sky.
0:2:55|0:3:1|The title of this film, "Break Up at Dawn," is written in bright characters in the sky, one stroke at a time.
0:3:1|0:3:9|The next morning, a sports car raced through the city center and arrived at a commercial office building in the midst of clear skies, parking on the side of the road.
0:3:9|0:3:16|The man in the car confidently gets out, closes the door, walks into the building, and is greeted respectfully by the employees.
0:3:30|0:3:33|This dashing man is [Zhang Nan].
0:3:33|0:3:38|Hearing the employees laughing behind him, [Zhang Nan] turned around, his eyes intimidating the two.
0:3:38|0:3:42|Upon entering the office, the employee greeted [Zhang Nan].
0:3:50|0:3:58|[Zhang Nan] sat leisurely in the chair, took the documents from the employee's plea, flipped through them expressionlessly, then signed his name on the documents and handed them back to the employee.
0:4:1|0:4:20|After the employee thanked and left with the documents, [Zhang Nan] watched the employee's receding figure. His serious expression relaxed, his hand casually resting on the table, fingers tapping lightly, spinning the chair around to look around. He picked up the Rubik's Cube on the shelf behind him, passing the time by twisting the cube.
0:4:20|0:4:27|The dazzling music, along with the Rubik's Cube spinning in Zhang Nan's hands, takes us to the bar, where the air is filled with the smell of smoke and alcohol.
0:4:27|0:4:30|The music blared at its loudest, almost deafening.
0:5:1|0:5:2|Raise the wine glass and walk out.
0:5:5|0:5:16|[Zhang Nan] walked through the bustling crowd and arrived at the center of the dance floor, where the most eye-catching beauty on stage sensually swayed her hips and moved her agile hands in rhythm with the music.
0:5:16|0:5:22|The dim light, the enchanting gaze of the beautiful woman, is like a flickering phantom in the eyes.
0:5:22|0:5:27|[Zhang Nan] was captivated by the beautiful woman's dancing, enough to make her forget her troubles.
0:5:27|0:5:34|The lighting, though dazzling, was not as noisy, and the music, though lively, was as refreshing as a waterfall.
0:5:36|0:5:47|[Zhang Nan] Upon closer inspection, the enchanting beauty dancing on the stage and the noble goddess by the pool earlier turned out to be the same person.
0:5:47|0:5:53|[Zhang Nan] looked mischievous as he vindictively recorded the footage of the beautiful woman dancing.
0:5:53|0:6:0|The beauty was completely unaware, as the music grew louder, she enjoyed the excitement and joy that the dance brought to her.
0:6:11|0:6:16|The music ends, and the beauty and her two male partners turn their backs, ending with a perfect dance pose.
0:6:16|0:6:21|[Zhang Nan] weaved through the cheering crowd, heading towards the center of the dance floor in search of beautiful women.
0:6:46|0:6:50|She followed [Zhang Nan] to the dance floor, confidently picked up a glass of wine, and drank it all in one gulp.
0:6:50|0:6:54|[Zhang Nan] also refused to show weakness, the two of them continued to drink one cup after another, and the glasses gradually emptied.
0:6:54|0:6:59|At this moment, [Zhang Nan] felt a bit dizzy due to the effects of alcohol and leaned to one side.
0:6:59|0:7:6|The beauty, however, was not affected at all. After finishing a glass, [Zhang Nan] was shocked and couldn't close his mouth, exclaiming repeatedly.
0:7:6|0:7:9|The crowd couldn't help but cheer as they watched the beauty duel with [Zhang Nan].
0:7:34|0:7:38|The beautiful woman stood up and took a few steps, then turned around and dominantly said to [Zhang Nan],
0:7:40|0:7:46|In an instant, [Zhang Nan] stood still, looked up to see the smile of the beauty, and also revealed a wicked smile.
0:7:46|0:7:51|Under the flickering neon lights of the bustling city, [Zhang Nan] races through the streets in a sports car.
0:7:51|0:7:54|[Zhang Nan] carried the drunk beauty to his own home.
0:7:54|0:8:0|He struggled to carry the beauty into the room, but as soon as he pushed open the door, he was taken down and both of them fell heavily onto the bed.
0:8:0|0:8:6|Within arm's reach, only the heavy and warm breath remained, the beauty fell unconscious in the arms of [Zhang Nan].
0:8:6|0:8:12|Seeing the sexy and charming beauty in front of him, [Zhang Nan]'s mouth couldn't help but curl up, and he started to have some crooked thoughts.
0:8:12|0:8:21|She flipped over and knelt on top of the beauty, swiftly unbuttoned the coat, took it off and threw it on the bed, then deftly unbuckled the belt, unzipped, all in one go.
0:8:22|0:8:31|At this moment, the beauty suddenly sat up, grabbed Zhang Nan's pants, and in a confused state, buried her head inside. Unable to hold back, she directly vomited out.
0:8:31|0:8:34|[Zhang Nan] could only endure the nausea and dared not move at all.
0:8:34|0:8:38|The beauty spit on [Zhang Nan]'s pants, then turned over and continued to sleep.
0:8:38|0:8:51|[Zhang Nan] was stunned, she looked at the beauty in shock, got up and threw the clothes into the washing machine for cleaning. After returning to the room, she changed the beauty into a clean shirt, and then sat on the edge of the bed, raising her hand helplessly to do some embroidery.
0:8:51|0:8:57|The next morning, [Le Er] was still lying in bed peacefully asleep, as if nothing had happened the night before.
0:8:57|0:9:4|[Le Er] The beautiful woman's short skirt from last night's dance lay neatly on the bed, as she raised her hand and stretched lazily, grabbing the pillow.
0:9:4|0:9:9|Due to drinking too much last night, the headache from the hangover made her furrow her brows.
0:9:9|0:9:18|[Le Er] gradually regained consciousness. She suddenly sat up and realized that she was in a strange environment, and her clothes had been changed to a shirt.
0:9:18|0:9:21|Seeing the messy bed, she couldn't help but scream loudly. 
0:9:24|0:9:28|[Zhang Nan] brushes his teeth and peeks out from the bathroom.
0:9:43|0:9:53|After arguing and fighting with [Zhang Nan], [Le Er] gets up, enjoys soaking in the bathtub, looks at the lazy sunlight outside the floor-to-ceiling window, relaxes her eyes, and is about to wash her hair with shampoo.
0:9:53|0:9:59|Later, [Le Er] casually picked up a bottle of toiletries on the bathtub, holding up the rejuvenating mirror, and kept shouting.
0:10:4|0:10:8|[Zhang Nan] rushed to the kitchen after washing up, preparing breakfast for the two of them in a hurry.
0:10:8|0:10:12|[Le Er] has changed into exquisite clothes and walked out in high heels.
0:10:16|0:10:22|The beauty approached [Zhang Nan], grabbed her clothes, leaned in close to [Zhang Nan]'s ear, and whispered.
0:11:23|0:11:28|[Zhang Nan] walked towards the podium, pointing at the photo on his phone, while the employees below were discussing animatedly.
0:11:46|0:12:2|The employees brought [Zhang Nan] to the stage, accompanied by elegant piano music. They saw a beautiful woman in ballet attire dancing gracefully under the spotlight. The music gradually intensified as she danced on her toes, her skirt swaying lightly with each step, resembling a flower about to bloom.
0:12:2|0:12:8|[Zhang Nan] was overjoyed, and as the female secretary approached to try to stop the beautiful woman, she was stopped by [Zhang Nan] reaching out his hand.
0:12:8|0:12:15|The beauty danced freely on the stage, watching her graceful and graceful dance, [Zhang Nan] couldn't contain the excitement in her heart and walked up to her.
0:12:15|0:12:27|The beauty was entranced by the music, spinning with the beat, unaware of [Zhang Nan] approaching from behind. Accidentally, she bumped into [Zhang Nan] and stepped back, stumbling to the ground, as the crowd anxiously rushed forward.
0:12:29|0:12:48|Zhang Nan went forward to help the beauty up, but she pushed him away.
0:12:48|0:12:52|[Zhang Nan] horizontally carries the beauty and drives to the hospital.
0:13:1|0:13:6|Zhang Nan and Le Er arrived at the billiard hall. The beautiful woman broke the rack and one ball went into the pocket.
0:13:6|0:13:10|[Zhang Nan] took a shot, but missed the pocket, and could only awkwardly chalk the cue stick.
0:13:10|0:13:13|The beauty whispered in [Zhang Nan]'s ear.
0:13:14|0:13:18|The beauty's hand brushed across [Zhang Nan]'s chest, causing him to feel numb.
0:13:23|0:13:29|The beautiful woman keeps changing the position and posture of hitting the ball, and each time she can accurately hit the cue ball into the pocket.
0:13:29|0:13:38|[Zhang Nan] couldn't take his eyes off as the beauty bent over to aim at the cue ball. He walked up to her, held her, wrapped his arms around her body, and leaned in to whisper in her ear.
0:13:57|0:14:1|The beauty pouted, and [Zhang Nan] stood up to kiss her on the left, but was stopped by a hand.
0:14:17|0:14:18|Shortly after, [Zhang Nan] left first.
0:14:18|0:14:25|The beauty watched as [Zhang Nan] walked away, flipping her long hair and revealing a complex and playful smile.
0:14:25|0:14:29|The beautiful woman then looked towards the bar in the distance, where the waiter was wiping the wine glasses.
0:14:29|0:14:37|After exchanging glances, [Le Er] turned and left, while the waiter [Zhang Nan] continued to wipe the tableware with a cold expression hidden beneath his eyes.
0:14:37|0:14:41|Instead, the beauty and [Zhang Nan] were frolicking joyfully by the seaside.
0:14:41|0:14:45|[Zhang Nan] sat down next to the beauty with a box of cola in his arms, and the beauty exclaimed in surprise.
0:15:0|0:15:4|[Zhang Nan] drank a bottle of cola, feeling good and coolly peeking at the beautiful woman.
0:15:4|0:15:10|She drank one bottle of cola after another as if her life depended on it, without the slightest hesitation.
0:15:10|0:15:13|The beauty was somewhat shocked, marveling at [Zhang Nan]'s persistence.
0:15:16|0:15:37|The beauty was amused by the cleverness of [Zhang Nan]. After [Zhang Nan] finished the last bottle of cola, he tilted his head back proudly. The beauty impressed, gave him a thumbs up. [Zhang Nan] suppressed the gas in his body and picked up a bottle of cola to hand it to the beauty.
0:15:40|0:15:43|The beauty puts down the cola, and both of them are amused.
0:15:43|0:15:48|The beauty smiled sweetly, [Zhang Nan] looked at the delightful beauty in front of him and said.
0:15:56|0:15:59|The beauty dodged [Zhang Nan] and ran towards the seaside.
0:15:59|0:16:5|[Zhang Nan] got up and chased after [Le Er], the two of them frolicking and playing on the beach, laughing constantly, and before they knew it, it was already night.
0:16:5|0:16:9|Zhang Nan and Le Er came to the beautiful woman's home to watch a movie, and the TV was playing a sensual scene.
0:16:9|0:16:17|In the film, a couple is bathing together. Watching this, [Zhang Nan] can't contain the excitement in his heart, and the content of the scene gradually becomes bold and stimulating.
0:16:17|0:16:20|[Zhang Nan] is lost in thought, constantly crossing his legs, with a twisted posture.
0:16:20|0:16:24|She took a small foreign doll from the side to cover her legs and looked at the beauty.
0:16:24|0:16:32|The beauty was staring at the TV intently, so [Zhang Nan] boldly approached her quietly, opening his right arm and moving closer to her side.
0:16:32|0:16:42|[Zhang Nan] pretended to yawn widely, taking the opportunity to reach out his right hand to try to embrace the beauty. However, the beauty turned around at this moment and looked at him, speaking earnestly to [Zhang Nan].
0:17:4|0:17:10|The beauty waved goodbye, [Zhang Nan] picked up a doll and walked towards the door, while both of them made a gesture of making a phone call.
0:17:15|0:17:21|[Zhang Nan] noticed this and awkwardly threw the little lamb plush onto the sofa, then helplessly waved his hand and left through the door.
0:17:21|0:17:24|The beauty couldn't help but laugh at the cute gesture of [Zhang Nan] as he walked away.
0:17:24|0:17:28|The next day, [Zhang Nan] was joking around with another girl in the hotel dressing room.
0:18:2|0:18:8|[Zhang Nan] looked apologetically at the girl in front of him, took the phone, and walked to the side to speak softly.
0:18:20|0:18:24|[Zhang Nan] smugly drove the sports car to the agreed location.
0:18:24|0:18:33|After stopping the sports car, [Zhang Nan] took out several condoms hidden in the car compartment. He then carefully put them into his shirt pocket, humming a tune contentedly.
0:18:33|0:18:43|Later, [Zhang Nan] took out a condom from his pocket, sniffed it, then took out a business card holder, casually put the condom into the holder, and got off the car holding a mobile phone.
0:18:46|0:18:53|[Zhang Nan] walked to the gate with brisk steps, knocked on the door like a gentleman, then called [Le Er] on the phone, with one hand in his pocket waiting for her arrival.
0:19:5|0:19:7|Upon hearing the sound of the door, [Zhang Nan] turned around in astonishment.
0:19:44|0:19:50|[Zhang Nan] took the porridge from [Le Er]'s hand and placed it on the table. The elderly people gathered around the table one after another, ready to take their seats.
0:19:50|0:19:54|[Le Er] walked over to greet everyone, then helped [Zhang Nan] sit down and introduced him to everyone.
0:19:55|0:19:59|[Zhang Nan] enthusiastically opens the business card holder.
0:20:19|0:20:23|When Grandma handed out business cards, [Zhang Nan] pulled out a condom with [Li].
0:20:32|0:20:38|The old man picked up the condom and examined it carefully. [Zhang Nan] felt embarrassed and tried to take it, while the old people laughed and looked at [Zhang Nan].
0:20:51|0:20:54|[Le Er] stood awkwardly, then stared at [Zhang Nan] with wide eyes.
0:20:54|0:20:55|[Zhang Nan] dared not make a sound.
0:21:16|0:21:31|At night, the city's lights added a mysterious atmosphere. Late at night, [Le Er] dragged her tired body back home. She took off her high heels, put on comfortable slippers, as if she had unloaded the exhaustion of the day, without noticing the man standing behind the screen.
0:21:31|0:21:35|The man is none other than the man who locked eyes with [Le Er] in the board game hall earlier.
0:21:35|0:21:56|The man quietly approached and suddenly embraced [Le Er] from behind. [Le Er] was startled at first, but then realized it was someone familiar to her. She smiled with joy, gently held the man's hand, turned around softly, grabbed the man's collar, and the man asked.
0:21:56|0:21:59|[Le Er] happily embraces the man, and the two of them joyfully hug each other tightly.
0:22:11|0:22:13|The man playfully tickled [Le Er]'s feet.
0:22:15|0:22:32|The next day, [Zhang Nan] drove a luxury sports car, speeding on the road. On the empty highway, the car roared like a lion, its speed as if bestowed with angel wings, under the enveloping sunlight, it seemed to have a faint halo, exuding a compelling dynamic energy at the intersection.
0:22:43|0:22:46|The rider blocked the path of [Zhang Nan]'s car and quickly drove away.
0:22:46|0:22:57|[Zhang Nan] adjusted his mood and continued driving, arriving at the banquet venue.
0:22:57|0:22:59|[Zhang Nan] escorted [Le Er] to the event in elegant attire.
0:22:59|0:23:3|[Le Er], dressed in a long gown, stood out as the two of them walked slowly into the venue.
0:23:12|0:23:21|The two sat down, and the man with glasses raised his glass and handed it to [Zhang Nan].
0:23:53|0:24:3|[Zhang Nan] is followed by several beautiful women walking over.
0:24:36|0:24:40|[Le Er] stopped the swaying wine glass in her hand and looked at [Zhang Nan] with a cold smile.
0:24:40|0:24:44|[Zhang Nan] and [Le Er] locked eyes for a moment, then [Le Er] rolled her eyes and got up to leave.
0:24:44|0:24:51|[Le Er] walked towards the stage without looking back, took off her high heels, and danced with the man on stage in a duet.
0:24:51|0:24:57|Watching as [Zhang Nan] suddenly changes his expression on stage, [Le Er] sensually twists her body, her enchanting eyes captivating the soul.
0:24:57|0:25:0|She shines on the stage, full of confidence.
0:25:0|0:25:4|The stage lights were all overshadowed by the brilliance of [Le Er], not even half as dazzling as [Le Er].
0:25:6|0:25:21|The audience below the stage were all attracted by [Le Er]'s dance moves, applauding and praising. Guided by the male dancer, [Le Er] spun, bent her waist, and struck a sexy pose, leaving [Zhang Nan] stunned with a smile in his eyes. However, the following movements of [Le Er] became more and more daring.
0:25:24|0:25:26|The male dancer even touched [Le Er]'s perky buttocks.
0:25:26|0:25:31|[Zhang Nan] instantly changed his facial expression, bent forward, and stared at [Le Er] who was dancing passionately on the stage.
0:25:31|0:25:35|[Le Er] looked at [Zhang Nan] in the audience, and their eyes met.
0:25:35|0:25:40|[Le Er] ambitiously leans towards [Zhang Nan], who looks down without looking at [Le Er], puts down the wine glass, and angrily leaves the table.
0:25:41|0:25:45|Walking to the door, she turned back reluctantly to look at the stage.
0:25:45|0:25:49|Le Er, who was originally immersed in dancing a duet, noticed Zhang Nan leaving.
0:25:49|0:25:55|Seeing the lonely figure of [Zhang Nan], she stopped in her tracks, left the stage, leaving the male dancer standing alone in place.
0:25:57|0:26:1|[Le Er] walked out of the gate with a smile, only to see [Zhang Nan] standing outside, looking angry.
0:26:1|0:26:12|[Le Er] lowered her head and smiled, unable to suppress the smile on her lips. She leisurely walked to the side of [Zhang Nan], reached out her hand, and single-handedly propped up the wall next to [Zhang Nan], showing off her dominance.
0:26:12|0:26:19|[Le Er] teasingly asked.
0:26:19|0:26:23|[Zhang Nan] deliberately avoids looking at [Le Er], tilting his head to one side and whistling, making [Le Er] laugh.
0:26:39|0:26:43|[Zhang Nan] easily controlled by [Le Er]'s sweet smile, the two of them burst into laughter as they looked at each other.
0:26:43|0:26:51|From a distance on the stairs, a man wearing a hat hides behind the glass, secretly capturing the scene of the two laughing and playing, while they are completely unaware.
0:26:51|0:27:0|The two arrived at the mall, with [Le Er] engrossed in looking at a diamond ring. [Zhang Nan] leaned in and asked [Le Er].
0:27:4|0:27:11|Le Er kept putting snacks into the car at the supermarket, while Zhang Nan pushed a cart full of snacks behind her.
0:27:11|0:27:16|Seeing [Le Er] lingering in the potato chip section, [Zhang Nan] said.
0:27:25|0:27:29|[Zhang Nan] looked at the full car of snacks, [Le Er] reached out her hand and pulled [Zhang Nan] along.
0:27:29|0:27:33|[Zhang Nan] kept looking back at a car full of snacks, not far from [Le Er], as the two of them prepared to leave the supermarket.
0:27:33|0:27:35|[Zhang Nan] passes through the exit.
0:27:41|0:27:47|[Zhang Nan] looked around, then felt his own clothes pockets to confirm, his eyes widened in surprise as he pulled out several boxes of condoms from his pocket.
0:28:6|0:28:31|[Le Er] pulled [Zhang Nan] and ran, the two of them sprinted in the mall, dodging the pursuit of the security guards. They ran to the escalator, with the security guards close behind. So the two ran back down the escalator, going up and down, until they escaped. In the middle of the mall, [Zhang Nan] taunted.
0:29:3|0:29:8|Zhang Nan pushed open the door, [Le Er] pouted and made a face at Zhang Nan, who helplessly stared at [Le Er].
0:29:34|0:29:40|In the memory, [Le Er] is a baby crying in the wall fortress.
0:29:47|0:29:56|[Le Er] told [Zhang Nan] about her past. After listening, [Zhang Nan] felt a myriad of emotions and felt that he understood the beautiful woman in front of him even more, deepening his smile.
0:29:56|0:30:3|At night, [Le Er] returned home alone, slowly stepping into the living room, only to find a man lying on the sofa, already fast asleep.
0:30:3|0:30:7|Watching the man sleeping peacefully, [Le Er] recalled scenes of herself practicing ballet in the past.
0:30:7|0:30:12|Practicing dancing on her own, always falling in the same spot, she is caught by a man from behind.
0:30:24|0:30:35|[Le Er] thought about the past friendship with men, complex emotions welled up in her eyes. Hearing the message alert on her phone, she lowered her head, opened her bag, took out her phone, and held it against her chest to block the view.
0:30:35|0:30:43|Later, [Le Er] cautiously glanced at the man sitting on the sofa, then continued to read the message. However, at that moment, the man opened his eyes and stared at her.
0:30:43|0:30:46|[Le Er] received a message from [Zhang Nan], which read:
0:30:48|0:30:51|The man frowned and turned over when he saw the smile on [Le Er]'s face.
0:30:51|0:30:56|The next morning, Zhang Nan stood on the rooftop, looking into the distance and reminiscing about his childhood.
0:31:23|0:31:28|As a child, Zhang Nan watched his mother leave without looking back at the door of the welfare home.
0:31:28|0:31:34|Thinking of this, the man's heart was once again shrouded in darkness, and at night, [Zhang Nan] took [Le Er] to the seaside for a date.
0:31:44|0:31:52|Beside them, a small boat lit up. [Le Er] sighed and slowly walked towards the boat with excitement.
0:31:52|0:31:56|The beach was deserted, and a delicate little boat illuminated the entire coastline.
0:31:56|0:32:3|[Zhang Nan] ran up quickly, reached the side of the small boat, took [Le Er]'s hand, and led her slowly up the stairs, creating a very romantic scene.
0:32:4|0:32:19|[Zhang Nan] gentlemanly escorts [Le Er] onto the small boat, then guides her to take a seat. [Le Er] sits elegantly on the chair, with [Zhang Nan] sitting beside her. As [Le Er] gazes at the exquisite small boat in front of her, her mind wanders.
0:32:31|0:32:42|Le Er turned her head and saw lights shining not far away. Under the lights were the elderly people from the nursing home, dressed neatly and dancing formally. They were singing together on the steps. Le Er was so moved that she covered her mouth.
0:32:42|0:32:48|The elderly people started singing, so [Le Er] clapped and cheered excitedly for them, constantly giving thumbs up to encourage them.
0:32:48|0:32:57|The elderly people were inspired and sang confidently. [Le Er] looked gratefully at [Zhang Nan], who gestured with his eyes and then made encouraging gestures to the elderly people.
0:33:6|0:33:13|[Zhang Nan] looked at [Le Er] affectionately, [Le Er] turned her head and looked at [Zhang Nan] with a gentle smile in her eyes.
0:33:13|0:33:21|[Zhang Nan] smiled without saying a word, then gestured for [Le Er] to look up at the sky. Following [Zhang Nan]'s gaze, [Le Er] saw the beautiful snowflakes falling onto her embroidered hair.
0:33:21|0:33:29|Le Er reached out to touch the falling snowflakes, the crystal-clear snowflakes were pure and flawless, symbolizing a pure and romantic love.
0:33:30|0:33:33|Zhang Nan and Le Er laughed happily in the heavy snow.
0:33:33|0:33:38|The young man making snow is blowing snowflakes energetically on the side, creating a romantic scene for the two.
0:33:38|0:33:45|[Le Er] slowly stood up and walked to the middle of the boat, opened her arms, spun around happily and joyfully, carefully catching snowflakes one by one.
0:33:45|0:33:51|[Zhang Nan] saw this scene and was deeply moved. He quietly walked up behind [Le Er] and took out a jewelry box from his pocket.
0:34:19|0:34:24|[Zhang Nan] took out the diamond ring that [Le Er] had seen in the mall before and put it on [Le Er]'s hand.
0:34:36|0:34:46|Le Er and Zhang Nan smiled at each other during their blind date, then they entered the room. Le Er was wearing a camisole, showing off her curves. She leaned against Zhang Nan and pouted lightly.
0:34:46|0:34:52|[Zhang Nan] turns over, presses down [Le Er], then passionately kisses [Le Er], the two of them deeply in love, entwined in each other's arms.
0:34:52|0:34:58|In the distance, a man is holding binoculars, silently watching the movements of [Le Er] and [Zhang Nan] through the window and the hazy curtains.
0:34:59|0:35:15|The two of them kissed each other passionately, embracing tightly. Seeing their kiss, the man gritted his teeth and slowly put down the telescope, calming himself. With red eyes, he turned away from the two, lowered his gaze, and in his mind echoed the promise he made to [Le Er] during his childhood in the orphanage.
0:35:31|0:35:38|The man's thoughts returned to the present, leaning against the wall and breathing heavily. He turned his head angrily, refusing to look at [Le Er].
0:35:38|0:35:45|The next morning, with the tide surging and the sunlight pouring down, [Le Er] arrived at the seaside, with childhood memories of the man's promise echoing in her mind.
0:35:59|0:36:23|[Le Er] strolled by the sea, feeling the sea breeze, squinting towards the shore, then closing her eyes. Meanwhile, [Zhang Nan] was still sound asleep in the room, stretching lazily and trying to embrace [Le Er] as he turned over. He reached out and found that there was no longer the warmth of [Le Er] by the bed. [Zhang Nan] sat up with his eyes half closed, not yet fully awake from his dream, calling out for her.
0:36:32|0:36:36|Zhang Nan quickly put on his pants and searched the room, but did not see Le Er.
0:36:36|0:36:40|Looking at the empty room, [Zhang Nan] sat down on the bed in despair.
0:36:40|0:36:43|[Zhang Nan] had a dark expression on his face, with complex and strange emotions surging in his heart.
0:36:43|0:36:48|He didn't expect [Le Er] to go anywhere, but he saw the wallet with the zipper opened by the bedside.
0:36:48|0:36:54|So, Zhang Nan flipped through the wallet, unzipped the inside zipper, and found that the wallet was already empty.
0:36:54|0:36:57|[Zhang Nan] anxiously arrived at the hotel front desk, looking around as he walked to confirm.
0:37:10|0:37:19|After receiving the hotel clerk's reply, [Zhang Nan] felt disappointed, she helplessly came to the seaside blowing the cold sea breeze, running frantically to search for the missing [Le Er].
0:37:19|0:37:29|By the seaside, couples were everywhere. She tried calling [Le Er] but couldn't get through, feeling more and more desperate.
0:37:41|0:37:48|[Zhang Nan] tiptoed to look inside the nursing home, the furnishings were neat but there was no one around, as if the nursing home didn't exist at all.
0:37:52|0:37:58|[Zhang Nan] angrily drove away in a sports car, while the man watched [Zhang Nan] leave from the top of the nursing home building.
0:37:58|0:38:2|At night, the man carefully examines the ring at [Le Er]'s house.
0:38:10|0:38:13|[Le Er] catches the ring thrown by the man and is pulled onto the sofa.
0:39:22|0:39:26|Originally, the man had prepared a truck early on and took the old ladies away.
0:39:26|0:39:29|At the same time, [Zhang Nan] is getting drunk at the bar.
0:39:29|0:39:32|She was a bit drunk, swaying unsteadily, with people around her still urging her to drink.
0:39:43|0:39:49|[Zhang Nan] kept drinking glass after glass of alcohol, his mind gradually becoming unclear, unable to see the scene around him.
0:39:49|0:39:53|The lights were spinning in Zhang Nan's eyes, while the woman sitting next to him was still toasting with him.
0:39:57|0:40:8|In the midst of his daze, a familiar figure appeared before Zhang Nan. Le Er was walking towards him in a sparkling short skirt, the same one as before, as if nothing had ever changed.
0:40:8|0:40:12|[Zhang Nan] stood up and confirmed, with a misty look in his eyes and a smile in his eyes.
0:40:12|0:40:18|[Zhang Nan] confirmed once again, his eyes blurred, and [Le Er] in front of him turned into a strange woman.
0:40:18|0:40:24|[Zhang Nan] hung his head, sat down dejectedly, and the woman beside him made room for the girl who had just arrived to sit next to [Zhang Nan].
0:40:31|0:40:36|[Zhang Nan] fell onto the girl's legs beside him.
0:40:36|0:40:42|In the depths of her heart, [Le Er] stood with her long hair blowing in the wind on a small hill by the sea.
0:40:42|0:40:47|[Zhang Nan] sat on the balcony of the room, looking out at the distant scenery with a bottle of champagne beside him.
0:40:47|0:40:48|[Le Er] dialed the familiar phone number.
0:40:58|0:41:2|[Zhang Nan] answered the phone, raised his mobile phone, and saw that the incoming call was from [Le Er].
0:41:2|0:41:8|Taking a deep breath to calm herself, a complex mix of emotions surged through her heart.
0:41:8|0:41:10|[Zhang Nan] finally answered the phone call.
0:41:22|0:41:25|[Zhang Nan] had just finished speaking when [Le Er] hung up the phone.
0:41:25|0:41:37|[Zhang Nan] picked up the phone and hurriedly got up to run outside. She looked around in the room privately, picked up the car keys on the table and walked out of the room. On the other end of the phone, [Le Er], who hung up the phone, crossed her arms in front of her chest, feeling relieved.
0:41:37|0:41:43|[Le Er] looked into the distance, while [Zhang Nan] drove the sports car wildly. [Le Er] got out of the car to greet the elderly people coming back to the nursing home.
0:42:6|0:42:11|[Zhang Nan]'s car was parked outside the entrance of [Le Er]'s residential area, but [Le Er] was nowhere to be seen.
0:42:11|0:42:14|He anxiously dialed Le Er's phone, but no one answered.
0:42:14|0:42:21|[Zhang Nan] once again felt helpless after the anticipation, and could only stand by the car waiting boredly.
0:42:21|0:42:24|Le Er was nowhere to be seen even as night fell.
0:42:24|0:42:31|He returned home disappointedly, only to find a table full of exquisite dishes laid out on the dining table.
0:42:31|0:42:34|[Zhang Nan] woke up suddenly and saw [Le Er] sleeping on the sofa.
0:42:36|0:42:42|He walked quietly to [Le Er]'s side, looking at her peaceful sleeping face with joy.
0:42:42|0:42:47|He knelt quietly beside [Le Er], not daring to disturb her, and gently stroked her hand.
0:42:47|0:42:52|[Le Er] hugged [Zhang Nan] tightly.
0:43:13|0:43:21|[Zhang Nan] cherishes [Le Er] deeply, holding her tightly and responding as if wanting to merge [Le Er] into his own body.
0:43:21|0:43:24|During the days without meeting, [Zhang Nan] missed her deeply.
0:43:24|0:43:31|We finally see [Le Er] now, with [Zhang Nan] burying his head in her arms, then embracing and kissing her passionately, both deeply moved.
0:43:31|0:43:38|The next morning, [Le Er] tied up her hair, dressed up beautifully, and lay on the sofa with a pillow, lost in thought.
0:43:38|0:43:40|[Zhang Nan] walked over with a clear and cheerful expression.
0:44:21|0:44:30|After Zhang Nan and [Le Er] joked around, they got up and left. Outside the court, a manager greeted a black sedan, and a middle-aged man with glasses stepped out of the car.
0:44:41|0:44:52|[Le Er] dressed up as a hotel staff for her first love, opened the car door, a short-haired and capable middle-aged woman got out of the car, stretched her arm, the man kept staring at her, and finally called out.
0:45:36|0:45:45|[Mrs. Zhang] looked [Le Er] up and down, pursing her lips and pulling [Zhang Nan] along.
0:45:45|0:45:50|The crowd walked into the building, while the man on the side clenched the banknotes, staring fiercely as they left.
0:46:2|0:46:15|The man recalls his childhood, the young [Mrs. Zhang] pushes the little boy away and leads [Zhang Nan] and his family forward.
0:46:15|0:46:21|Tears hidden by hatred in the man's eyes, staring at the [Zhang Nan] family, while [Mrs. Zhang] swings her golf club in the field.
0:46:29|0:46:35|[Zhang Nan] took off his gloves and sat down at a nearby seat to rest, while [Le Er] also rested on a seat.
0:46:35|0:46:40|[Zhang Nan] shook the tea cup, glanced at [Le Er], and slowly asked.
0:46:49|0:46:53|[Le Er] raised her glass to cover her face, while [Zhang Nan] also raised his glass to drink tea.
0:47:0|0:47:4|[Zhang Nan] paused for a moment, then set down the teacup and said.
0:47:41|0:47:44|[Le Er] received a satisfactory answer and smiled triumphantly.
0:47:44|0:47:46|[Zhang Nan] looked at the girl in front of him with a worried expression.
0:47:49|0:47:51|[Zhang Nan] impatiently helps his mother into the car.
0:48:18|0:48:22|Zhang Nan embraces [Le Er] and watches as [Mrs. Zhang] leaves.
0:48:22|0:48:29|[Le Er]’s first love hid behind the curtain, silently watching the departing car, pulling down the brim of the hat to conceal her lonely expression.
0:48:29|0:48:36|At night, [Zhang Nan] drives a sports car to take [Le Er] home, weaving through the bustling traffic.
0:48:43|0:48:49|Le Er felt lost, leaning against the car window as [Zhang Nan]'s car sped away.
0:48:49|0:48:55|The next morning, [Le Er]'s first love sat on the rooftop of the nursing home, holding a photo in his hand.
0:48:55|0:49:3|Watching the photo, the man furrowed his brows, clenched his fists in anger, crumpled the photo, and it fell onto the man's camera bag.
0:49:6|0:49:10|In the photo, the [Zhang Nan] family of three looks happy and content.
0:49:10|0:49:27|[Zhang Nan] arrives at the parking lot and gets ready to drive after answering the phone.
0:49:27|0:49:31|[Zhang Nan] was knocked down by the masked man behind him as soon as he reached the car.
0:49:31|0:49:41|The masked man took Zhang Nan's phone. Inside the nursing home, Le Er is having a meal with the elderly.
0:50:16|0:50:26|Next to the seaside factory, tall weeds grew. [Le Er] looked towards the factory, pushed aside the weeds and walked forward with determination, but she couldn't find the factory gate and couldn't enter the factory.
0:50:28|0:50:33|[Le Er] peeled away the weeds and finally arrived at the window, but the windows of the factory were all surrounded by iron mesh.
0:50:33|0:50:41|Le Er observed the terrain in the factory and continued to search for the main gate.
0:50:41|0:50:48|[Le Er] saw through the window that the factory was filled with cardboard boxes.
0:50:48|0:50:50|He continued walking and saw the kidnappers in the factory drinking.
0:51:4|0:51:11|[Le Er] almost caught the attention of the kidnappers, and quickly got up to hide.
0:51:11|0:51:18|[Le Er] finally found the entrance to a factory. He carefully crouched behind the wall and moved forward slowly.
0:51:18|0:51:21|[Zhang Nan] was tied up with his hands behind his back, hanging on the wall.
0:51:36|0:51:42|The kidnappers ran to the other side, while [Le Er] hid behind a nearby wall, silently watching everything.
0:51:42|0:51:46|Taking advantage of the kidnappers' departure, [Zhang Nan] ran forward to take cover behind a pile of cardboard boxes.
0:51:46|0:51:51|Seeing [Zhang Nan] with blood all over his face from being beaten, [Le Er] ran over with a heart full of pain, avoiding the eyes of the kidnappers.
0:51:52|0:51:58|Taking advantage of the kidnappers' distraction, [Le Er] finally managed to run to [Zhang Nan]'s side, shouting anxiously.
0:51:58|0:52:2|[Le Er] was on the verge of tears, frantically tearing off the tape that sealed [Zhang Nan]'s mouth.
0:52:18|0:52:22|[Le Er] ran over to untie the rope tied to the pillar.
0:53:4|0:53:8|One of the kidnappers was shot by [Le Er]'s first love with an arrow and fell to the ground, while the other kidnapper said.
0:53:14|0:53:16|[Le Er] quickly picked up the knife on the ground.
0:53:27|0:53:35|[Le Er] was carrying the injured [Zhang Nan], but accidentally caught sight of the weapon used by the bandit to fight the police. In that moment, she was stunned, her mind filled with a thousand thoughts.
0:53:35|0:53:43|But [Le Er] still calmly supported [Zhang Nan] and walked out of the seaside factory. The two of them supported each other and ran away outside the factory.
0:53:44|0:53:49|Le Er's first love stood at the top of the factory, silently watching her, helping Zhang Nan to escape.
0:53:49|0:53:53|He looked complex, gritting his teeth, his mind recalling the past.
0:53:53|0:54:2|He also rode a motorcycle with [Le Er] through the streets, shouting and laughing on the deserted streets, the two of them carefree and innocent.
0:54:3|0:54:10|[Le Er] reached out her hand, opened her arms to feel the shape of the wind, but now all the memories have become the past.
0:54:10|0:54:17|Now, [Zhang Nan] can only watch [Le Er] leave with red eyes, feeling both unwillingness and regret in his heart.
0:54:17|0:54:24|At night, the man arrived at [Le Er]'s house and rudely pushed [Le Er] against the wall.
0:54:35|0:54:44|[Le Er] pushed the man away, took out the weapon from the man's clothes and questioned him. [Yun Chuan] froze, let go of [Le Er], put his hands in his pockets, and dared not look at him.
0:55:18|0:55:32|[Yun Chuan] rudely pushed [Le Er] onto the sofa. Feeling forced, [Le Er] slapped [Yun Chuan] in the face. [Yun Chuan] stood there stunned, holding his face. [Le Er] took the opportunity to push [Yun Chuan] away, crying as she ran out of the room, leaving [Yun Chuan] sitting alone on the sofa. He sat there muttering to himself, trying to convince himself over and over again.
0:55:36|0:55:40|[Yun Chuan] took deep breaths, calming his shocked and amazed emotions.
0:55:40|0:55:48|[Le Er] has never hit herself before. [Yun Chuan] feels very uncomfortable at the thought that [Le Er] is now hitting herself for another man.
0:55:48|0:55:53|[Yun Chuan], pretending to be strong, finally calmed down a bit and left [Le Er]'s home.
0:55:53|0:56:3|He rode his motorcycle on the bustling road, unable to control his emotions. Tears welled up in his eyes, from sniffles to sobs, and finally he shouted out loud to release his feelings.
0:56:5|0:56:16|He roared loudly as if no one was around, [Yun Chuan] accelerated the speed of cycling, Xie Qiu's eyes concealed with pride and strength, leaving only the deep loneliness and powerlessness in his eyes.
0:56:16|0:56:26|Unaware of all this, [Le Er] was alone in the bathroom, taking a pregnancy test. Seeing two lines on the test stick, [Le Er] was momentarily unsure of how to make a decision.
0:56:26|0:56:34|After a moment of silence, he went to the seaside alone. [Le Er] pondered for a moment, with the words promised by [Zhang Nan] and [Yun Chuan] echoing in her mind.
0:56:35|0:56:35|Zhang Nan is at home.
0:57:3|0:57:8|Excitedly answering the phone when [Le Er] heard it ring.
0:57:29|0:57:38|[Le Er] stopped the action of touching the toast in her hand, while [Zhang Nan] poured orange juice backwards.
0:57:38|0:57:42|[Le Er] hung up the phone nervously, as [Zhang Nan] finished his orange juice and asked.
0:58:1|0:58:13|[Zhang Nan] picked up the bread crumbs and walked happily to the door, with [Le Er] following behind to straighten [Zhang Nan]'s collar.
0:58:13|0:58:20|[Le Er] was still immersed in happiness with [Zhang Nan], when the door was suddenly pushed open forcefully. [Le Er] turned around in shock, only to find that it was [Yun Chuan].
0:58:24|0:58:30|[Zhang Nan] drove the car and felt the inside pocket, which was empty.
0:58:30|0:58:47|[Zhang Nan] realized he had forgotten his wallet, so he turned back home, while [Le Er] was being dragged into the residential area by [Yun Chuan].
0:58:47|0:58:50|[Yun Chuan] dragged [Le Er] into the pavilion, and [Le Er] couldn't break free.
0:59:52|0:59:58|[Le Er] looked determined, not letting [Yun Chuan] touch him. [Yun Chuan] glared at him fiercely, raising his finger towards [Le Er], speaking angrily.
1:0:32|1:0:35|[Zhang Nan] approached with a smile, looking at the person next to [Le Er].
1:1:30|1:1:32|[Le Er] was eating when suddenly she felt nauseous.
1:1:32|1:1:36|Yun Chuan, angrily not looking at Le Er, was asked with concern by Zhang Nan.
1:1:45|1:1:48|[Le Er] looked at [Yun Chuan] in shock as he grabbed her hand.
1:2:48|1:2:59|After making sure that Zhang Nan was sound asleep, Le Er finally got up quietly, walked to the end of the bed, pulled back the curtains, and looked outside with a complex expression, deep in thought.
1:2:59|1:3:11|At this moment, Le Er's phone rang. She ruthlessly hung up the call, then her phone rang again. Le Er quickly hung up the call once more, nervously turning her head to look at Zhang Nan.
1:3:12|1:3:29|Immediately, he crossed his arms in front of his chest, his eyes looking into the distance. Outside the window, the sound of engines starting could be heard, but [Zhang Nan] was completely unaware, still deeply asleep, with a peaceful expression on his face.
1:3:29|1:3:35|The next day, [Zhang Nan] was driving when his phone rang.
1:3:35|1:3:39|He glanced at his phone and answered silently.
1:3:52|1:4:0|[Zhang Nan], confident and brave, hung up the phone, put down the mobile phone, gripped the steering wheel with both hands, and arrived at the agreed location with [Yun Chuan], the Sunrise Building.
1:4:3|1:4:9|[Yun Chuan] stood on a box on the rooftop, looking down at the ground, while [Zhang Nan] had just arrived at the rooftop of the Sunrise Building.
1:4:9|1:4:14|Seeing [Yun Chuan], [Zhang Nan] steadily approached him with slow but determined steps.
1:4:14|1:4:19|[Yun Chuan] saw [Zhang Nan], turned around, jumped off the box, and slowly approached [Zhang Nan].
1:4:19|1:4:23|Like a cheetah spotting its prey, [Le Er] lowered its head and stared at Zhang Nan.
1:4:23|1:4:28|Standing one meter apart with their hands in their pockets, [Yun Chuan] spoke first.
1:4:33|1:4:35|[Zhang Nan] stared at [Yun Chuan] and shook his head firmly.
1:4:35|1:4:38|Yun Chuan is puzzled, looking at Zhang Nan and asking.
1:4:42|1:4:45|[Yun Chuan] listened, sneered, lowered his head and continued to ask.
1:5:11|1:5:13|[Yun Chuan] sneered and clapped his hands.
1:5:20|1:5:22|[Zhang Nan] dodges with his eyes.
1:5:40|1:5:48|It turns out that the waiter by the pool is [Yun Chuan], who hands a glass of red wine to [Le Er].
1:5:48|1:6:0|It turns out that the DJ spinning at the nightclub is also [Yun Chuan], and he has been exchanging glances with [Le Er].
1:6:0|1:6:3|[Yun Chuan] approached [Zhang Nan] while speaking, and took out a bank card.
1:6:48|1:7:0|[Yun Chuan] threw the ring that [Zhang Nan] had given to [Le Er] during his confession onto [Zhang Nan]'s hand. [Zhang Nan] stared at the ring on his hand, tightly gripping it, with a look of disappointment in his eyes, and angrily walked away from the rooftop.
1:7:0|1:7:5|Meanwhile, [Le Er] was completely unaware of the showdown between the two men, and was still celebrating Grandma Li's birthday in the karaoke lounge.
1:7:20|1:7:25|[Le Er] blows out the candles with the elderly, and the lights instantly come on.
1:7:25|1:7:30|On the other side, [Zhang Nan] sadly threw away his phone and drank alone at home to get drunk.
1:7:30|1:7:35|He poured himself a full glass of wine, feeling a splitting headache but still heartbroken.
1:7:38|1:7:43|At this moment, [Yun Chuan] is standing on a rooftop, smugly looking at his phone and smiling triumphantly.
1:7:43|1:7:50|He put down his phone, while in the karaoke room, [Le Er] sang "Sweet Honey" with the elderly, everyone had a great time.
1:7:50|1:7:52|Suddenly, Le Er's phone received a message.
1:8:21|1:8:24|[Le Er] placed the phone on his chest, pondering, as he nervously returned home.
1:8:26|1:8:29|Seeing the empty bottles of alcohol on the coffee table, one after another.
1:8:29|1:8:34|He took the key, turned on the light, took off his high heels, and changed into home slippers.
1:8:34|1:8:38|Zhang Nan walked into the living room feeling strange, while closing the key card holder.
1:8:38|1:8:41|And [Zhang Nan] happened to appear from the other side of the escalator.
1:8:41|1:8:44|Upon seeing [Le Er], [Zhang Nan] cried out with a sob.
1:8:48|1:8:52|[Zhang Nan] approached and pushed away [Le Er]'s embrace, questioning with red eyes.
1:9:7|1:9:14|[Le Er] wanted to escape in sadness, but was rudely pulled back by [Zhang Nan].
1:9:14|1:9:18|[Zhang Nan] pushes [Le Er] against the wall.
1:9:18|1:9:23|[Zhang Nan] took out a stack of long paper.
1:9:26|1:9:33|[Zhang Nan] placed all the banknotes in [Le Er]'s hands.
1:9:33|1:9:44|[Zhang Nan] is holding back his sadness and still taking the money.
1:9:50|1:9:56|[Le Er] was rudely thrown onto the sofa by [Zhang Nan], her body landing heavily.
1:9:56|1:10:0|[Le Er] cried in pain and shook her head, while [Zhang Nan] pointed at [Le Er].
1:10:0|1:10:12|[Zhang Nan] suddenly slapped [Le Er], who then fell onto the sofa, holding her face.
1:10:12|1:10:16|[Zhang Nan] realized his actions and cried in pain, slowly sitting down on the sofa.
1:10:18|1:10:25|[Le Er] endured the discomfort, propped up her body, and looked tearfully at [Zhang Nan].
1:10:25|1:10:30|[Zhang Nan] was also heartbroken, tears welling up in his eyes, he slowly spoke.
1:10:45|1:10:56|[Zhang Nan] felt more and more heartbroken as he spoke, turning his head away and not looking at [Le Er].
1:10:56|1:11:0|[Le Er] covered her face, crying with tears streaming down, while [Zhang Nan] lamented with a heavy heart.
1:11:30|1:11:35|[Le Er] shook her head sadly, [Zhang Nan] bowed his head in pain and wept, tears washing his face.
1:11:35|1:11:37|He pinched [Le Er]'s face and said.
1:11:48|1:11:58|[Le Er] kept shaking her head in regret, while [Zhang Nan] looked disappointed and crestfallen. The two of them avoided eye contact, with [Zhang Nan] wiping away tears and then pretending to be strong as he lifted his head and spoke.
1:12:27|1:12:31|Suddenly, Le Er's phone rang, and it was Yun Chuan calling.
1:12:31|1:12:33|[Zhang Nan] angrily points at the phone and leaves.
1:12:33|1:12:36|Le Er didn't take her phone and ran towards Zhang Nan, hugging her.
1:12:43|1:12:50|[Le Er] tightly hugged [Zhang Nan] from behind and refused to let go, both of them with tears streaming down their faces, but the phone rang incessantly at the most inopportune moment.
1:12:50|1:13:0|[Zhang Nan] shook his head in sorrow, crying as he tried to pry [Le Er]'s hands off of her.
1:13:0|1:13:4|[Zhang Nan] heartlessly shook off [Le Er]'s hand, crying bitterly.
1:13:4|1:13:8|[Le Er] stayed in place, motionless, quietly taking deep breaths.
1:13:8|1:13:11|[Zhang Nan] slammed the door shut, leaving [Le Er] standing there trembling in fear.
1:13:15|1:13:20|[Le Er] watched as [Zhang Nan] left without looking back, standing in place, gasping in distress.
1:13:20|1:13:26|She squatted down helplessly, slowly knelt down, and finally knelt sitting on the legs, hands supporting the legs, crying uncontrollably.
1:13:32|1:13:35|That night, two melancholic individuals were secretly feeling sorrowful.
1:13:35|1:13:40|[Zhang Nan] is at home, staring at the ring filled with sweet memories of the two of them.
1:13:43|1:13:45|[Le Er] stayed up all night, silently crying on the sofa.
1:13:49|1:13:56|[Zhang Nan] lies on the bed, drinking cola in pain, throwing away the empty can of Irn-Bru, tears uncontrollably streaming down.
1:13:56|1:14:3|[Zhang Nan] finished a bottle of cola, then opened another one and drank it like crazy.
1:14:3|1:14:10|But [Le Er] is also not feeling well. She is alone at home, feeling restless, and ate three bowls of instant noodles while crying.
1:14:10|1:14:14|She numbs her inner self with binge eating, but it only makes her feel worse.
1:14:14|1:14:33|After a long time, in the late night, [Zhang Nan] knocked on the door of the nursing home. A lady came out to open the door for [Zhang Nan], who asked.
1:14:33|1:14:35|[Zhang Nan] was questioned by his grandmother and could only shake his head.
1:15:28|1:15:33|[Zhang Nan] looked at the unfamiliar bracelet on his grandmother's hand, and then turned to the kind old people, lost in thought.
1:15:33|1:15:38|[Zhang Nan] looked at the grandparents around him with emotion, his mind filled with a thousand thoughts.
1:15:38|1:15:41|On another day, [Le Er] was reminiscing about his farewell with [Yun Chuan] on the mountain.
1:15:53|1:16:2|On the rooftop of the nursing home, [Yun Chuan] uses his familiar weapon to shoot out sharp objects with such great force and speed that it can directly penetrate a bottle of cola.
1:16:2|1:16:8|He smiled smugly and mysteriously, slowly lowering the weapon in his hand, with a complex expression on his face.
1:16:8|1:16:14|The sun was shining brightly that day, the gentle breeze caressed the sparkling waves that enveloped the bright forest.
1:16:14|1:16:24|On the other side of the shore, the small boat where [Zhang Nan] and [Le Er] declared their love is still moored. [Le Er], dressed up in high heels, arrives at the boat filled with memories.
1:16:24|1:16:33|He caressed the hull, moving forward slowly. After taking a few steps, he reluctantly faced the hull, while [Le Er] looked towards the coastline, memories of the past flashing through her mind.
1:16:34|1:16:39|The painful and sweet memories surged in his heart, as if he had thought of something.
1:16:39|1:16:47|[Le Er] looked down at the small boat, reached out to touch the edge of the boat affectionately, and then showed a worried expression.
1:16:47|1:16:55|[Le Er] turned his gaze back to the sea, leaning against the boat, recalling the past full of memories that he couldn't bear to let go of, with the person he deeply loved.
1:16:55|1:17:0|So he picked up his phone, dialed the number, and called the person he was most familiar with.
1:17:25|1:17:30|After hanging up the phone, [Zhang Nan] drove his sports car towards the seaside at full speed.
1:17:30|1:17:34|[Le Er] crossed her arms in front of her, excited and nervous, waiting for [Zhang Nan].
1:17:34|1:17:39|The sea breeze made Le Er feel a bit cold, while Yun Chuan suddenly appeared behind Le Er.
1:17:39|1:17:57|[Yun Chuan] slowly approached [Le Er] from the side of the small boat. Sensing the movement behind her, [Le Er] turned around with anticipation to embrace the person behind her, only to be startled to find that it was [Yun Chuan]. Startled, [Le Er] was then grabbed by [Yun Chuan], who locked her throat from behind.
1:18:42|1:18:44|[Zhang Nan] appeared like a savior.
1:18:55|1:19:0|[Yun Chuan] quietly took out a weapon from behind and aimed it at [Le Er].
1:19:29|1:19:33|[Yun Chuan] took out an old photo, which showed him and [Zhang Nan]'s wife.
1:20:18|1:20:21|[Le Er] looked at [Zhang Nan] with concern as [Yun Chuan] lowered his weapon.
1:20:24|1:20:33|[Le Er] looked back at [Zhang Nan] with reluctance, then threw herself into [Yun Chuan]'s arms. [Yun Chuan] smirked triumphantly at [Zhang Nan], who looked on in despair.
1:20:33|1:20:39|At this moment, [Le Er] let go of [Yun Chuan]'s hand, left his embrace, took a step back, and then ran towards [Zhang Nan].
1:20:39|1:20:48|[Zhang Nan] gradually unfolds a smile, while [Yun Chuan] breaks down emotionally. He shouts loudly, raises his weapon high, and crazily aims at [Zhang Nan], screaming in despair.
1:20:49|1:20:54|[Le Er] was stunned when she saw [Yun Chuan] aiming at [Zhang Nan], and stood frozen in place for a moment.
1:20:54|1:20:59|Seeing [Yun Chuan] about to launch a weapon, [Le Er] quickly opened her arms and stood in front of [Zhang Nan].
1:20:59|1:21:5|[Yun Chuan] fires the weapon, [Le Er] helps block for [Zhang Nan], and the weapon ends up piercing [Le Er]'s chest.
1:21:5|1:21:8|[Le Er] was hit, took two steps back, and fell into the arms of [Zhang Nan].
1:21:8|1:21:23|The two of them lay on the ground, with [Le Er]'s chest soaked in blood, his expression full of pain. He looked at [Zhang Nan] in anguish, then dropped his weapon. Nearby, some enthusiastic citizens called the police, who rushed to the scene. [Zhang Nan] anxiously called out to [Le Er].
1:21:31|1:21:38|[Yun Chuan] dropped his weapon, knelt on the beach, his expression filled with pain and his eyes out of control.
1:21:38|1:21:54|The police appear, capturing [Yun Chuan], who looks at [Le Er].
1:21:54|1:21:58|[Le Er] finished speaking, then with the last bit of strength, she fell to the ground in discomfort.
1:22:4|1:22:16|[Zhang Nan] screamed in despair, but could no longer call back [Le Er]. [Le Er] quietly fell into [Zhang Nan]'s arms, the dress on her chest already dyed blood red. [Zhang Nan] continued to call out for [Le Er] desperately.
1:22:16|1:22:30|[Zhang Nan] closed his eyes and called out, with flashbacks of the first encounter with [Le Er] by the seaside floating in his mind. [Le Er], in a long dress, elegantly walked towards him, and at that moment, [Zhang Nan] knew that everything was destined, even if [Le Er] made him fall into the water.
1:22:38|1:22:50|In Zhang Nan's mind, flashes of memories from the past interactions with Le Er appear, every smile and frown of Le Er, as well as her adorable antics, stirring up his emotions.
1:22:50|1:22:56|After falling in love, [Le Er]'s cooking and hugs before leaving home made [Zhang Nan] feel extra warm.
1:22:58|1:23:2|Every time Le Er looks at herself, her smile is so sweet.
1:23:2|1:23:7|On the small boat, [Zhang Nan] brought snowflakes to [Le Er], making her smile so brightly.
1:23:7|1:23:10|The joy and romance were so real, so close.
1:23:29|1:23:38|[Zhang Nan] held [Le Er] in pain as they fell to the ground together, the two young lovers crying so desolately on the sunny beach.
1:23:38|1:23:45|[Zhang Nan] can no longer get back his beloved, he cries out in despair, telling [Le Er] in a state of confusion, repeating it over and over again.
1:23:51|1:23:58|But [Le Er] could no longer hear, feelings of regret, sadness, and complex despair surged in [Zhang Nan]'s heart.
1:23:58|1:24:5|[Le Er] lies peacefully in the arms of [Zhang Nan] on the beach, with a small boat beside them witnessing their love.
1:24:5|1:24:9|The poignant scene freezes here, preserving their memories of love and pain.
