0:2:31|0:2:57|Opening the battle log of 1952, it is written that on October 14th, in order to disrupt peace and escalate the war, the American aggressors, after rejecting peace talks at Panmunjom, launched a large-scale attack on two hill positions in the Shangganling area at six fifteen in the morning today.
0:3:1|0:3:34|On October 18th, in the face of a large-scale attack from the enemy who was well prepared, our army was in a passive and unfavorable position. The battle was extremely intense and brutal, today being the fifth day with continuous artillery fire and smoke filling the air. A soldier held his breath, lying in the trench, then rushed out. The platoon leader of the 7th Company handed the headset to [Meng Degui].
0:4:0|0:4:7|A soldier runs in.
0:4:7|0:4:10|[Meng Degui] took off his headphones and ran out of the tent.
0:4:10|0:4:17|On the small path halfway up the hill behind, the Eighth Company led by [Zhang Zhongfa] is pushing forward without stopping, striving to support the Seventh Company as soon as possible.
0:4:17|0:4:22|Enemy planes dropped bombs, and the bombs fell into the lake beside the mountain road, creating huge splashes of water.
0:4:23|0:4:28|Soldiers wearing inconspicuous straw hats on their heads, running forward.
0:4:28|0:4:31|Some soldiers are rushing to the front line on trucks.
0:4:31|0:4:36|A female soldier stands at the intersection, waving a flag to direct traffic.
0:4:36|0:4:42|Two trucks turned into the right mountain road, while the rest of the trucks continued to drive forward.
0:4:42|0:4:48|Several farmers are filling in the holes on the road, while the sanitation worker on the roadside is carrying a stretcher to transport the wounded.
0:4:50|0:4:55|North Korean women set up a large pot and boil water for the soldiers.
0:4:55|0:5:2|As the last truck passed by the women, the soldiers on the truck kept throwing down the supplies ignited by the artillery fire.
0:5:2|0:5:8|On Qilian Peak, our soldiers are holding their ground, resisting the enemy's fierce attacks.
0:5:8|0:5:14|Some soldiers were firing machine guns at the enemy, while others were continuously throwing grenades at them. [Commander] ran over.
0:5:19|0:5:23|[Commander Meng Degui] knelt on the ground and helped up the soldier hit by a shell.
0:5:30|0:5:34|Zhang Zhongfa tilted his head and sacrificed himself.
0:5:34|0:5:43|Instructor [Meng Degui] slowly put him down, took off his hat, pondered for a moment, stood up, and shouted to his comrades.
0:5:54|0:6:1|A shell landed beside [Meng Degui], and the fragments hit his eyes. He covered his eyes in pain and staggered into the command post.
0:6:19|0:6:31|After the chief of staff issued the communication order to the soldier, he picked up the phone.
0:6:31|0:6:32|The chief of staff lowered his head and looked at his watch.
0:6:42|0:6:45|[Commander] pondered with his hands behind his back for a moment, then walked to the side, paused, and turned back.
0:7:10|0:7:10|He walks through the aisle.
0:7:10|0:7:13|Walking into another room, [Chen Dehou] asked the political commissar sitting at the table. The political commissar glanced at his watch, and the mayor and the political commissar exchanged a smile before the mayor walked over to shake hands with [Zhang Zhongfa].
0:7:44|0:7:50|[Zhang Zhongfa] takes off his hat and pulls out a towel from his pants pocket to wipe off sweat.
0:7:50|0:7:56|[Zhang Zhongfa] put on his hat, took the Tang porcelain cup, and drank the water in big gulps.
0:7:56|0:7:57|[Commander] walked up and said.
0:8:6|0:8:12|[The commander] led [Zhang Zhongfa] to the terrain sand table and pointed to a hill with a pen.
0:8:35|0:8:40|[Zhang Zhongfa] stared at the terrain sand table in thought, while [Chen Dehou] walked away with his hands behind his back.
0:9:13|0:9:17|[Commander] took the phone call.
0:9:34|0:9:35|Captain Li said.
0:9:39|0:9:40|The [commander] said.
0:9:40|0:9:44|[The commander] hung up the phone, and Chui Shi-yuan Lao Wang walked in. Lao Wang was about to leave when he saw [Zhang Zhongfa], he smiled, waved his hand, and walked out of the room.
0:10:12|0:10:12|[Zhang Zhongfa] lowered his head.
0:10:43|0:10:47|The political commissar stood up and walked to [Zhang Zhongfa]'s side.
0:11:43|0:11:46|The mayor emphasized on the side, the political commissar hung up the phone, and Chuishi Yuan Lao Wang walked in again, mayor.
0:12:9|0:12:19|Lao Wang left, and [Commander] put on his hat and walked out of the house. He saw a soldier sitting on a stone outside, with a notebook on his lap, writing something.
0:12:19|0:12:20|The soldier stood up immediately.
0:12:20|0:12:21|[Commander] steps forward.
0:12:21|0:12:23|[Yang Decai] hands the diary to [the commander].
0:12:52|0:13:1|[The Mayor] returned the notebook to [Yang Decai], looked at him, then circled behind him, shook his water bottle, and walked back to face [Yang Decai].
0:13:25|0:13:27|[Yang Decai] took out a handkerchief and wiped the sweat off.
0:13:32|0:13:37|The platoon leader, who used to be a machine gunner, Zhang Zhongfa, walked over, and the division commander glanced at his watch.
0:13:55|0:13:59|[Zhang Zhongfa] saluted to [Commander], and [Commander] saluted back to him.
0:13:59|0:14:5|In the darkness of the night, flames soared into the sky as the soldiers hurried along the road, with the infantryman answering the phone call.
0:14:20|0:14:25|The soldiers of the Eighth Company are carrying guns and running towards the main peak.
0:14:25|0:14:30|Some soldiers were supporting women.
0:14:30|0:14:35|Before the sky had fully brightened, they had already arrived near the main peak.
0:14:35|0:14:40|[Zhang Zhongfa], a row of [Chen Dehou] and [Yang Decai] were lying in the trench to scout the situation of the battle.
0:14:40|0:14:43|The hillside is bare. [Chen Dehou] said.
0:14:47|0:14:54|[Zhang Zhongfa] saw the Seven Warriors pointing, and the three of them quickly leaped out of the trench.
0:14:54|0:15:2|[Meng Degui] is lying in the trench with bandages over his eyes, preparing hand grenades.
0:15:2|0:15:9|[Zhang Zhongfa], [Chen Dehou], and [Yang Decai] climbed to the top of the mountain, where a soldier from the Seventh Company ran down to greet them and shook hands with them.
0:15:13|0:15:18|[Meng Degui] fumbled his way over and shook hands with [Zhang Zhongfa]. He covered his eyes.
0:15:39|0:15:41|[Meng Degui] gestures with his hands.
0:16:6|0:16:11|[Zhang Zhongfa] shook hands with [Meng Degui], and the enemy started to attack again.
0:16:11|0:16:12|An enemy aircraft drops a bomb.
0:16:33|0:16:37|[Meng Degui] put down his hands and lowered his head. The soldier drove [Meng Degui] off the battlefield.
0:17:15|0:17:20|The enemy's artillery attack was very fierce, and [Zhang Zhongfa] and his group quickly took cover in a cave.
0:17:23|0:17:29|In the sky, enemy planes continuously drop bombs, shattering a piece of rock which rolls down the mountain.
0:17:29|0:17:34|In the cave, the soldiers felt a strong vibration throughout the mountain.
0:17:34|0:17:40|On the hillside, the enemy launched a large number of tanks to provide heavy artillery cover on the ground.
0:17:40|0:17:44|The whole battlefield was suddenly filled with flying shells and thick smoke.
0:17:48|0:17:58|Under the dual cover of airplanes and tanks, the enemy forces kept advancing towards the mountaintop.
0:17:58|0:18:7|The soldiers of the Eighth Company found it difficult to launch an effective counterattack, so they could only constantly move between cover and trenches to minimize unnecessary casualties.
0:18:7|0:18:10|Rocks and mud kept hitting them.
0:18:18|0:18:23|[Chen Dehou] took cover behind a mound with a machine gun.
0:18:23|0:18:26|After a while, the enemy artillery fire weakened.
0:18:26|0:18:32|[Zhang Zhongfa] glanced outside the cave, made a quick decision, and led the soldiers to drill out of the cave.
0:18:32|0:18:35|The Eighth Company soldiers sounded the horn for a counterattack.
0:18:38|0:18:45|[Chen Dehou] shook off the dirt on his body, raised the machine gun, and two soldiers lifted the cloth covering the machine gun, preparing to fire.
0:18:45|0:18:53|[Zhang Zhongfa] hid behind a large rock, looking down the mountain through binoculars, only to see a dense crowd of enemy soldiers on the hillside.
0:18:53|0:18:54|[Zhang Zhongfa] speaks to the treadmill operator.
0:19:1|0:19:21|On the mountaintop, a row of volunteer army cannons fired shells in succession, catching the enemy off guard. They scrambled to the ground to avoid the shells, with some trying to continue climbing up. However, the volunteer army held the high ground, and the intense barrage forced them to retreat down the mountain. In the chaos, some even dropped their guns.
0:19:21|0:19:22|The volunteer army continues to fire shells.
0:19:25|0:19:33|The enemies in Zone Four were knocked down one after another, with one enemy soldier covering his ears and running down the mountain in panic.
0:19:41|0:19:45|[Zhang Zhongfa] smiled, rolled up his sleeves, and loosened his collar.
0:19:45|0:20:6|[Yang Decai] handed him a water bottle, he took a big sip. Suddenly, he realized something was wrong. He looked down the mountain and saw the enemy general ordering the soldiers to shoot at the retreating enemy soldiers in the valley, forcing them to charge forward despite the bombardment of the volunteer army shells. Several enemies fell to the ground with serious injuries.
0:20:11|0:20:15|The enemy soldiers charged towards the top of the mountain.
0:20:15|0:20:24|[Zhang Zhongfa] frowned, his face full of anxiety.
0:20:24|0:20:28|An enemy aircraft dropped a bomb, narrowly missing the infantry soldier, who was lying on the ground.
0:20:28|0:20:32|The infantry crew member stood up and continued to call out.
0:20:32|0:20:35|[Zhang Zhongfa] shook off the dirt on his body and looked down the mountain.
0:20:35|0:20:37|The hillside is densely packed with enemy troops.
0:20:45|0:21:4|[Yang Decai] ran to inform the soldiers to vigorously throw grenades behind the trenches, while a soldier kept firing a heavy machine gun at the enemy. Some enemies were hit and fell to the ground, while others continued to charge forward.
0:21:9|0:21:13|Some enemies have already climbed to the top of the mountain, hiding at the cliff edge and throwing grenades at our troops.
0:21:13|0:21:21|[Zhang Zhongfa] and the soldiers were hiding behind the rocks on the mountaintop. With a wave of his hand, two soldiers rushed out, but were quickly killed by the enemy's explosion.
0:21:21|0:21:33|[Zhang Zhongfa] sent out two more soldiers, carrying explosive barrels, charging out. At this moment, some enemy soldiers with machine guns climbed up. One of our soldiers was shot and rolled down from the mountaintop.
0:21:33|0:21:38|The Eighth Company held their position firmly and the enemy forces were ultimately unable to reach the mountaintop.
0:21:42|0:21:53|After the battle, as the smoke cleared, the hilltop was littered with bodies and weapons, the land blackened by artillery fire.
0:21:53|0:22:0|The Eighth Company started clearing the battlefield and rescuing the wounded.
0:22:0|0:22:7|[Zhang Zhongfa] inspects the battlefield and issues orders. The soldier operating the heavy machine gun during the battle is eating quickly to replenish his energy.
0:22:12|0:22:19|After the war, the hilltop was in a mess, with various items shattered by artillery shells scattered on the ground.
0:22:19|0:22:27|[Zhang Zhongfa] instructed the soldiers to pay attention to forming ammunition.
0:22:27|0:22:38|Some soldiers are carrying wounded soldiers on their backs, some are carrying supplies, some are collecting scattered ammunition, and some are continuing to scout the enemy situation. 
0:22:38|0:22:48|[Chen Dehou] sat in the trench smoking, while Mao Sihai sat beside him drinking water and nibbling on dry rations.
0:23:9|0:23:20|The world-renowned [Chen Dehou] and Maosihai had a sudden change in expression, and the enemy launched a new round of attack, and the Eighth Company immediately joined the battle.
0:23:20|0:23:30|A soldier of our army climbed to the top of the mountain, occupied the advantageous position, and kept throwing grenades down the mountain to prevent the enemy from climbing up.
0:23:30|0:23:38|More soldiers arrived on the hillside, engaging the enemy in close combat. Our soldiers were seen kicking with their feet, pushing with their hands, and using the butt of their rifles to strike the enemy.
0:23:40|0:23:46|A soldier was wrestling with the enemy on the ground, while another enemy standing by tried to hit him with the butt of the gun, but ended up hitting his own comrade on the back of the head.
0:23:49|0:24:2|A soldier, Zhang Zhongfa, was dragged up from the ground by two enemies holding his arms. He kicked one enemy away, then used a hand grenade to heavily strike the heads of the enemies on both sides. An enemy with a machine gun started shooting at him, and he eventually fell down.
0:24:2|0:24:8|A soldier leaped out of the trench with a bayonet in hand, rushing into a group of enemies and engaging in a fierce battle with them.
0:24:8|0:24:16|On the hill, the enemy grabbed the explosive barrel from a soldier of our army. The two were deadlocked, and the soldier let go of the barrel while pulling out the fuse, causing the enemy to roll down the hill with the explosive barrel.
0:24:16|0:24:18|[Zhang Zhongfa] takes off his hat, while [Yang Decai] blows the horn.
0:24:44|0:25:5|The soldiers carried out the heavy machine gun, and [Zhang Zhongfa] also personally went to the very front of the battlefield.
0:25:5|0:25:7|[Yang Decai] runs towards the machine gun.
0:25:19|0:25:24|[Zhang Zhongfa] puts on his hat, pushes aside the soldier, and personally operates the heavy machine gun.
0:25:24|0:25:29|He squinted one eye, his forehead covered in sweat beads.
0:25:29|0:25:46|The battle log of 1952 recorded that on October 19th, the Eighth Company went into position. In less than a morning, they repelled the enemy's increasingly frenzied attacks one after another, a total of twenty-three times.
0:25:46|0:25:50|A car stopped at the entrance of the camp.
0:25:50|0:25:53|[Commander] hurriedly came down and walked into the camp headquarters.
0:25:53|0:25:58|A soldier carrying a gun and a bag followed behind him.
0:25:58|0:26:1|In the house, Zhang Zhongfa takes off his hat and hands it to him.
0:26:8|0:26:13|The chief of staff nodded, went to the command room, [Commander] took off his coat, while the political commissar looked at the terrain sand table, frowning.
0:26:38|0:26:49|The chief of staff walked in and reported to [the division commander] that the order had been issued for the troops on the position to retreat, but the main peak position could not be contacted, what should we do?
0:27:33|0:27:38|[Zhang Zhongfa] is currently operating a heavy machine gun and firing fiercely.
0:27:38|0:27:42|The enemies fell to the ground one after another, then retreated repeatedly.
0:27:42|0:27:46|[Yang Decai] rushed to report the instructions.
0:27:46|0:27:53|[Zhang Zhongfa] suddenly leaned in towards him.
0:27:53|0:27:54|[Zhang Zhongfa] looked down the mountain.
0:28:44|0:28:48|He shook his hand and walked into the tunnel with a frown.
0:28:48|0:28:50|Got hit by the branches at the door.
0:28:50|0:29:0|The lighting in the tunnel was not sufficient, with enough height for people to walk upright but only allowing two or three people to stand side by side.
0:29:0|0:29:9|The soldiers crowded in the narrow tunnel, sitting on both sides against the rock walls, leaving a small space in the middle for only one person to pass through.
0:29:13|0:29:17|They smoked, drank water, each with a look of anger on their faces.
0:29:17|0:29:20|Two soldiers almost started fighting.
0:29:20|0:29:24|[Zhang Zhongfa] is patrolling inside the tunnel, with [Yang Decai] following behind him with a flashlight.
0:29:24|0:29:30|[Zhang Zhongfa] accidentally kicked a soldier, who immediately tightened his grip on the gun, ready to fight back.
0:29:30|0:29:34|He relaxed only when he looked up and saw it was Captain Zhang Zhongfa.
0:29:34|0:29:38|Instructor [Meng Degui] from the Seventh Company felt his way into the tunnel.
0:29:38|0:29:40|[Zhang Zhongfa] ran over to help him.
0:29:45|0:29:57|Commander [Meng Degui] held hands with [Zhang Zhongfa], who helped [Meng Degui] to his bed. The soldiers watched as he shook off [Zhang Zhongfa]'s hand and walked away angrily, only to come back pointing at [Zhang Zhongfa], who was about to speak.
0:30:29|0:30:39|[Zhang Zhongfa] hesitated to speak, [Yang Decai] with tears in his eyes. A soldier wanted to step forward to speak, but was stopped by the soldier beside him.
0:30:43|0:30:50|Two soldiers supported Commander [Meng Degui] as he walked away, shouting towards the direction of [Zhang Zhongfa] before leaving.
0:30:56|0:31:1|[Zhang Zhongfa] lifted his lips, but explained nothing.
0:31:20|0:31:29|The soldiers left dejectedly.
0:31:29|0:31:35|[Zhang Zhongfa] took off the telescope hanging around his neck, sat on the edge of the bed, and then lay down again.
0:32:3|0:32:12|[Yang Decai] lit a candle, and the dim tunnel suddenly lit up. [Zhang Zhongfa] looked over, then turned away.
0:32:12|0:32:26|[Yang Decai] looked at [Zhang Zhongfa], quietly took off the water bottle, poured water into [Zhang Zhongfa]'s porcelain cup, and handed the cup and dry rations over.
0:32:26|0:32:34|[Zhang Zhongfa] refused, lowered his head, so [Yang Decai] had to put the things on the stool beside the bed.
0:32:34|0:32:36|[Chen Dehou] walked over with a gun on his back.
0:32:42|0:32:44|[Zhang Zhongfa] held his hand.
0:32:59|0:32:59|[Chen Dehou] comes into view.
0:33:30|0:33:38|[Chen Dehou] scratched his head, [Zhang Zhongfa] furrowed his brow, raised the cup to drink water, and then abruptly put it down.
0:34:0|0:34:2|A female soldier runs into the tunnel.
0:34:2|0:34:3|Looking around.
0:34:4|0:34:7|She walked up to [Zhang Zhongfa].
0:34:59|0:35:3|[Zhang Zhongfa] took the headphones off the treadmill operator's head and put them on himself.
0:36:21|0:36:22|[Zhang Zhongfa] walked away, [Chen Dehou] fiddling with the gun, then [Zhang Zhongfa] turned back excitedly.
0:36:48|0:36:53|[Zhang Zhongfa] looked at Wang Lan, who saluted and happily ran out, then ran back.
0:37:16|0:37:18|Wang Lan ran away with a smile, [Zhang Zhongfa] turned his head and saw the soldiers all bowing their heads.
0:37:46|0:37:53|[Zhang Zhongfa] is moving, and the soldiers stand up. After dark, the enemy's searchlights shine back and forth in the mountain valley.
0:38:17|0:38:30|Several enemies were patrolling on the hilltop, with Zhang Zhongfa and Yang Decai lying at the entrance of the tunnel observing outside. The searchlight occasionally illuminated their faces.
0:38:30|0:38:35|[Yang Decai] carried the gun on his back, ready to launch an assault, while [Zhang Zhongfa] held him back.
0:38:47|0:38:54|[Yang Decai] bent over and rushed out, the enemy's gunfire erupted.
0:38:54|0:39:1|[Zhang Zhongfa] nervously leaned forward to look, only to see [Yang Decai] quickly lie down and avoid being hit.
0:39:1|0:39:9|Waiting quietly for a moment, [Zhang Zhongfa] agilely got up, jumped off the hill, dashed out of the enemy searchlight's beam, and ran towards the camp.
0:39:11|0:39:16|[Zhang Zhongfa] watched [Yang Decai] leave from a distance before finally leaving the entrance of the tunnel with a sense of relief.
0:39:16|0:39:23|In the tunnel, the soldiers who had been fighting for a day were exhausted and fell asleep in the narrow tunnel.
0:39:23|0:39:33|Wang Lan took good care of [Meng Degui], he had just placed his hand on the instructor's pulse, and the days of exhaustion made him nod off with his head tilted.
0:39:33|0:39:35|[Zhang Zhongfa] quietly patrolled in the tunnel.
0:39:56|0:39:58|He walked to the bedside of [Meng Degui] and straightened his back and feet.
0:39:58|0:39:58|Wang Lan noticed that [Zhang Zhongfa] was approaching and quickly stood up.
0:40:33|0:40:52|Zhang Zhongfa lightly kicked the sleeping Mao Sihai on the ground, Mao Sihai stood up with a gun on his back, Zhang Zhongfa turned his head towards Wang Lan, Mao Sihai straightened up and spoke boldly, leading you.
0:40:57|0:41:0|Wang Lan is packing up, [Mao Sihai] walks over.
0:41:9|0:41:14|[Meng Degui] sat up, supported by [Zhang Zhongfa].
0:41:14|0:41:16|[Meng Degui] is holding hands with [Zhang Zhongfa].
0:41:16|0:41:17|A young soldier runs into the tunnel.
0:41:33|0:41:37|[Zhang Zhongfa] smiled, the day broke, the sunlight spilled into the valley, and the pine tree branches swayed gently in the wind.
0:42:2|0:42:10|In the misty mountains, inside the tunnel, soldiers are having breakfast.
0:42:10|0:42:23|Three soldiers looked out from the entrance of the tunnel, suddenly hearing a noise coming from above.
0:42:23|0:42:25|The soldiers all jumped up and chased after the squirrel.
0:42:30|0:42:37|[Zhang Zhongfa] heard the commotion and went to investigate.
0:42:37|0:42:47|[Zhang Zhongfa] took off his hat and also ran to catch the squirrel.
0:42:47|0:42:54|The soldiers were panting and sweating as they chased after them.
0:42:54|0:42:57|[Zhang Zhongfa] quickly used his hat to catch the squirrel and lifted it up.
0:43:1|0:43:9|The soldiers surrounded [Zhang Zhongfa] in a circle, showing off their skills one after another, eager to catch a glimpse of the squirrel.
0:43:9|0:43:19|The soldiers immediately put on their hats, straightened their collars, and [Chen Dehou] walked over.
0:43:19|0:43:22|[Zhang Zhongfa] handed the squirrel to the soldier next to him and strode towards the entrance of the tunnel.
0:43:23|0:43:50|In the distance, the sound of artillery fire rang out, as a large number of enemy troops were advancing towards Wusheng Mountain. On the hillside, the enemy soldiers were charging with guns in hand towards the trenches.
0:43:59|0:44:4|The soldiers are on the move.
0:44:4|0:44:11|The soldiers carried the machine gun to the entrance of the tunnel, and [Commander] gave a wave to issue orders.
0:44:11|0:44:19|The hillside was bare, without any cover. The enemy soldiers were caught off guard, many of them were hit by bullets and rolled down the hill.
0:44:25|0:44:34|The heavy machine gunner kept firing, and the enemies on the hillside fell to the ground one after another.
0:44:34|0:44:41|Under the instructions of the walking machine operator, heavy machine guns were set up at all tunnel entrances.
0:44:41|0:44:45|The enemy suffered heavy casualties.
0:44:45|0:44:54|The enemy soldiers who were not hit either fell to the ground or ran around in confusion, with only a few still moving towards Wusheng Mountain.
0:44:55|0:45:3|Several enemy soldiers discovered the location where [Zhang Zhongfa] was hiding. They crouched behind cover, lay on the ground, set up a machine gun, and started shooting towards the entrance of the trench.
0:45:3|0:45:10|The soldiers at the entrance of the tunnel couldn't locate the enemy for a moment, so they had to temporarily lower their heads to avoid the bullets.
0:45:10|0:45:17|When the heavy machine gun at the entrance of the tunnel stopped firing, the enemy soldiers who had been lying down immediately got up and continued to advance.
0:45:17|0:45:23|The soldiers at the entrance of the tunnel disregarded their lives, risking death to continue shooting, and tried their best to stop the enemy from attacking Wusheng Mountain.
0:45:26|0:45:32|Standing aside, Wang Lan looked around and quickly took his water bottle off his neck, handing it to [Zhang Zhongfa].
0:45:32|0:45:35|[Zhang Zhongfa] took a sip of water and handed the water bottle back to Wang Lan.
0:45:40|0:45:59|[Zhang Zhongfa] rolled up his sleeves and personally stood at the entrance of a tunnel, directing the battle. The soldiers lined up in the tunnel, each with a determined look on their faces. There were only enough space for two machine guns at the tunnel entrance, and one of them was not shielded. The soldier operating it had his upper body completely exposed to the enemy's gunfire.
0:46:0|0:46:6|Whenever the soldier operating the machine gun was hit, [Zhang Zhongfa] would wave his hand to signal to fill the gap.
0:46:6|0:46:12|The soldiers all understood that moving forward to fill the gap meant a high risk of being hit by bullets.
0:46:12|0:46:21|But they hesitated not at all. As soon as the platoon leader waved his hand, they quickly took off the guns hanging on themselves, and lay down at the entrance of the tunnel to ambush the enemy.
0:46:21|0:46:25|A soldier hit the enemy, but soon he was also shot by the enemy.
0:46:43|0:46:58|The machine gunners at other tunnel entrances were also extremely brave. Despite the large number of enemy troops, under the fierce artillery fire of the Eighth Company, they became disorganized, abandoned the attack on Wusheng Mountain, and ran down the mountain.
0:46:58|0:47:6|At that moment, the hillside was in chaos, with enemy soldiers not having a unified retreat route, scattering around like headless flies.
0:47:14|0:47:21|Looking down from the mountain, the hills are covered with the bodies of enemy soldiers.
0:47:21|0:47:25|In the tunnel, [Zhang Zhongfa] carries the severely wounded soldier for treatment.
0:47:25|0:47:30|Injured soldiers who were unable to shoot sat on the ground loading bullets for the machine gun.
0:47:30|0:47:34|Even the injured [Meng Degui] is feeling for bullets under the guidance of Zhang Zhongfa.
0:47:34|0:47:43|Everyone worked together, with those who could go rushing to the front lines and those who couldn't completing logistical work as quickly as possible.
0:47:48|0:47:49|Inside the camp command room.
0:48:28|0:48:30|[Commander] hung up the phone.
0:48:32|0:48:36|[Commander], the political commissar, and the chief of staff all smiled.
0:48:36|0:48:38|[Commander] picked up the phone.
0:48:47|0:48:50|The mayor walked back to the office with the political commissar's arm around his shoulder.
0:49:14|0:49:22|The mayor, the director of the Korean People's Army, called, and [General Chen] walked over to answer the phone.
0:49:28|0:49:30|[Commander] hung up the phone.
0:49:30|0:49:37|Captain Huang reported over the phone that they have organized the troops and are ready to cooperate with the tunnel team tonight to recapture the main peak position.
0:49:37|0:49:43|The chief of staff reported to [Division Commander], who frowned and walked a few steps with his hands behind his back.
0:50:17|0:50:18|Studying the terrain sand table carefully.
0:50:48|0:51:2|The chief of staff nodded in agreement. Inside the tunnel, [Zhang Zhongfa] said to [Chen Dehou],
0:51:2|0:51:4|At this moment, [Yang Decai] is struggling to crawl into the tunnel.
0:51:4|0:51:16|Several soldiers saw a leg hanging down at the entrance of the tunnel, hurried forward to drag the person in, and [Yang Decai] wiped his sweat and checked the water bottle.
0:51:40|0:51:44|[Yang Decai] took out a letter from his chest and handed it to [Zhang Zhongfa].
0:51:44|0:51:53|[Zhang Zhongfa] unfolds the letter, takes it to the candlelight to read, and all the soldiers gather around to listen to [Zhang Zhongfa] read the letter. [Meng Degui] walks over with the support of Wang Lan and Mao Sihai.
0:52:41|0:52:45|[Meng Degui] was supported to walk in front of [Zhang Zhongfa], then turned to the soldiers and spoke.
0:53:12|0:53:15|Several soldiers raised their hands and looked at each other.
0:53:18|0:53:20|Wang Lan and several soldiers raised their hands.
0:53:35|0:53:36|[Zhang Zhongfa] walked into the crowd.
0:54:1|0:54:9|Under the leadership of [Zhang Zhongfa] and [Meng Degui], the work in the tunnel is proceeding vigorously.
0:54:9|0:54:23|Soldiers were collecting ammunition, nailing nails into the rock wall, cleaning up, organizing supplies, and preparing for long-term living in the tunnel.
0:54:23|0:54:29|Posters are stuck on the walls of the tunnel, and firearms are neatly arranged on the ground.
0:54:33|0:54:44|After a soldier made the bed for the platoon leader, he curiously put on the headphones and started adjusting them while the radio operator wasn't paying attention.
0:54:44|0:54:49|The [usher] noticed and walked over to pat the back of his head, taking the headphones off his head.
0:54:53|0:55:0|[Wang Lan] handed the collected water kettle to two soldiers, who poured the water from the kettle into a large water tank.
0:55:0|0:55:6|After tidying up, Zhang Zhongfa and the others officially began their life in the tunnel.
0:55:6|0:55:12|Two soldiers stand guard at the entrance of the tunnel, keeping a close watch on the situation below the mountain, while one of them starts playing the flute.
0:55:18|0:55:33|Some soldiers are sewing clothes, some are reading, some are chatting, and some are sitting around a table playing cards, chess, and telling stories.
0:55:33|0:55:46|[Zhang Zhongfa] sat by the bed of Commander [Meng Degui], reading a letter to him. Meanwhile, several soldiers were playing with a squirrel. [Wang Lan] poured water while singing a song, and the soldiers gathered around, smiling and listening to him sing.
0:57:3|0:57:16|The screen shows the magnificent rivers and mountains of our country, under the blue sky and white clouds, the Great Wall stretches for thousands of miles, winding and twisting, with the Yellow River and the Yangtze River rolling along.
0:57:41|0:57:49|In the valley lies a dam, with water pouring out from the floodgate.
0:57:49|0:57:54|The port has built vertical docks to increase the speed of loading and unloading of goods on ships.
0:57:57|0:58:17|In the city, factories stand tall, emitting white smoke from towering chimneys.
0:58:17|0:58:23|The soldiers were intoxicated by the singing.
0:58:23|0:58:25|[Yang Decai] walked over carrying a water jug.
0:59:6|0:59:8|The soldiers all started singing along.
0:59:46|0:59:48|[Meng Degui] smiled and began to hum softly.
0:59:48|0:59:49|[Zhang Zhongfa] also started singing along.
1:0:17|1:0:27|[Wang Lan] hung the water bottles handed over by the soldiers on the rack made of tree branches, with [Yang Decai] following behind him, handing him three water bottles.
1:0:27|1:0:32|[Wang Lan] took the water bottle with a smile.
1:0:32|1:0:39|[Meng Degui] fell asleep, and [Zhang Zhongfa] quietly left.
1:0:39|1:0:42|[Yang Decai] saw the platoon leader leaving and said to [Wang Lan].
1:0:57|1:1:2|Wang Lan squatted down to continue watering, with [Yang Decai] squatting beside him.
1:1:58|1:2:0|He said.
1:2:17|1:2:18|Wang Lan's eyes were bright, smiling.
1:2:44|1:2:48|Wang Lan covered her face and shook her head repeatedly.
1:3:10|1:3:18|[Zhang Zhongfa] walked over, and [Yang Decai] quickly shook his head.
1:3:59|1:4:1|Wang Lan shook her head.
1:4:7|1:4:28|[Zhang Zhongfa] turned and left, while Wang Lan lowered her head in thought. The candle was blown out by the wind, and the soldiers woke up from their dreams. A soldier with bandages on his head lit the candle, and smoke filled the tunnel entrance. [Chen Dehou] walked into the tunnel.
1:4:39|1:4:45|The enemy troops were shooting at the entrance of the tunnel, and [Zhang Zhongfa] heard the machine gun fire and rushed towards the entrance of the tunnel.
1:4:45|1:4:52|The enemy soldiers lying in ambush outside suddenly threw the explosives into the tunnel.
1:4:52|1:4:56|[Zhang Zhongfa] lifted the explosive package, charged forward, and snatched the explosive package.
1:4:56|1:4:58|He quickly ran to the entrance of the tunnel and forcefully threw the dynamite pack out.
1:5:3|1:5:12|Later, [Chen Dehou] leaned against a soldier, and Wang Lan poured him a glass of water. [Chen Dehou] took a sip and said.
1:5:21|1:5:29|[Zhang Zhongfa] heard the sound of machine gun fire, ran to the entrance of the tunnel, and lay down to look outside. Several bullets hit the rock wall outside the tunnel, [Zhang Zhongfa] quickly buried his head.
1:5:34|1:5:40|[Zhang Zhongfa] lay on his back, gripping the edge of the tunnel entrance, and peered upwards.
1:5:40|1:5:42|Fortifications were built on the mountain above the tunnel.
1:5:42|1:5:42|[Zhang Zhongfa] walks back into the tunnel.
1:6:4|1:6:8|At night, [Zhang Zhongfa] lay at the entrance of the tunnel with two others to observe the situation.
1:6:32|1:6:37|After making sure there were no enemies lying in wait, they quickly slipped out of the tunnel entrance with grenades in hand.
1:6:37|1:6:40|They advanced cautiously and stealthily.
1:6:40|1:6:44|The spotlight shone on them, and they stopped with their heads down.
1:6:44|1:6:50|Suddenly, a soldier accidentally bumped into the empty can on the ground.
1:6:50|1:6:56|The enemy quickly started shooting, and the three soldiers had to roll to dodge and retreat back into the tunnel.
1:7:2|1:7:9|[Zhang Zhongfa] pushed him angrily, then went to drag an injured soldier into the tunnel.
1:7:9|1:7:20|Wang Lan went forward to support the wounded soldier, and Mao Sihai also came back.
1:7:20|1:7:31|[Zhang Zhongfa] waved his hand, walked to the entrance of the tunnel to take a look outside, then turned around and looked at the scattered empty cans inside the tunnel, a plan forming in his mind. He picked up an empty can, examined it, then walked to the tunnel entrance and threw it out, immediately followed by the sound of gunfire outside. After a while, [Zhang Zhongfa] threw another one out.
1:8:6|1:8:17|At night, [Yang Decai] sat at the entrance of the tunnel, feeling drowsy. Every now and then, he would throw an empty can outside.
1:8:17|1:8:20|In the tunnel, the soldiers leaned on each other and fell asleep in all sorts of positions.
1:8:20|1:8:21|Mao Sihai leaned on [Zhang Zhongfa]'s shoulder and fell asleep.
1:8:33|1:8:39|[Zhang Zhongfa] suddenly woke up, he glanced at his watch and saw that it was already 2 a.m.
1:8:39|1:8:49|[Zhang Zhongfa] staggered and woke up Mao Sihai, taking him to the entrance of the tunnel.
1:8:49|1:8:54|[Yang Decai] is still throwing empty cans, instructed [Zhang Zhongfa].
1:8:57|1:8:59|[Zhang Zhongfa] crawled out of the tunnel with Mao Sihai.
1:8:59|1:9:4|[Yang Decai] took quite a while to suddenly come to his senses during this moment.
1:9:33|1:9:45|Zhang Zhongfa and Chen Dehou climbed near the bunkers, took advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness, and quickly threw grenades. Both bunkers were destroyed by the explosions.
1:9:45|1:9:52|[Chen Dehou] and [Yang Decai] anxiously wait at the entrance of the tunnel, while [Zhang Zhongfa] safely brings Mao Sihai back to the tunnel.
1:9:52|1:9:56|Smugly said to [Chen Dehou].
1:10:12|1:10:16|[Zhang Zhongfa] frowned, and at the meeting [Chen Dehou] spoke.
1:10:36|1:10:40|[Zhang Zhongfa] stood up to answer the phone.
1:10:41|1:10:43|Inside the camp command room.
1:11:3|1:11:8|Think about it, [Zhang Zhongfa] looks at the soldiers.
1:11:34|1:11:37|A soldier chuckled and poked [Yang Decai].
1:11:55|1:12:6|We should educate him well. In the face of this brutal struggle, we need a high level of intelligence and technical skills. [Zhang Zhongfa] hung up the phone and walked up to [Chen Dehou].
1:12:37|1:12:47|[Zhang Zhongfa] walks towards [Yang Decai].
1:12:47|1:12:49|[Zhang Zhongfa] stood on a high place, surrounded by soldiers.
1:13:4|1:13:8|In the following days, each tunnel unit began to take action.
1:13:8|1:13:19|Soldiers shuttle through the tunnels, throwing grenades at the enemy from different directions.
1:13:19|1:13:23|During the day, the enemy kept moving sandbags to build bunkers.
1:13:45|1:13:48|After a round of artillery fire, the enemy troops continued to fortify the bunker.
1:13:52|1:14:2|The Balan soldiers lined up before setting off, and the [Commander] handed them a water bottle. Each person only took a small sip before passing the bottle to the next person.
1:14:25|1:14:31|At night, small teams from each tunnel organization launched attacks, blowing up bunkers and gathering intelligence on the enemy.
1:14:31|1:14:47|Thus, for every bunker the enemy built, [Zhang Zhongfa] blew up one, causing the enemy to be on edge and unable to rest at night.
1:14:47|1:14:52|Meanwhile, the follow-up troops and ammunition supplies are rushing to the front line at full speed.
1:14:53|1:15:1|In the midst of gunpowder smoke, a train carrying cannons roared past.
1:15:1|1:15:6|The car carrying provisions raced along the winding mountain road.
1:15:6|1:15:13|Amidst the rain of bullets, soldiers carrying weapons and North Korean women with backpacks march forward, braving the rugged terrain.
1:15:19|1:15:24|As time passed, water became increasingly precious in the tunnel.
1:15:32|1:15:42|The battle log of 1952 recorded that on October 25th, the tunnel unit indeed held the enemy tightly on these two hills.
1:15:44|1:15:46|At this moment, [Commander] stood in front of two rows of soldiers.
1:16:14|1:16:16|[Mayor] handed him two apples.
1:16:16|1:16:16|The soldiers set off with supplies of dry rations and ammunition.
1:16:16|1:16:17|The enemy's artillery fire was fierce all the way.
1:17:37|1:17:47|With the help of two soldiers, Lao Wang finally crawled into the tunnel with supplies.
1:17:47|1:17:49|Several soldiers ran over.
1:18:6|1:18:10|Zhang Zhongfa walked in the old Wangchao tunnel, and the soldier next to him asked him.
1:18:24|1:18:25|[Zhang Zhongfa] walks over.
1:18:32|1:18:39|Old Wang looked [Zhang Zhongfa] up and down, while the soldiers watched them. Old Wang pulled [Zhang Zhongfa] aside and patted his shoulder.
1:18:39|1:18:41|Lao Wang took out two apples wrapped in paper from his pocket, opened the paper, and handed the apples to [Zhang Zhongfa].
1:19:0|1:19:2|[Zhang Zhongfa] took the apple.
1:19:13|1:19:14|Applause from the audience.
1:19:26|1:19:29|[Zhang Zhongfa] handed the apple to Wang Lan, who happily ran off, with Yang Decai chasing after him.
1:19:29|1:19:30|[Yang Decai] patted his neck, and Wang Lan ran to the bedside of [Meng Degui].
1:19:30|1:19:31|[Meng Degui] sniffed the apple in front of his nose.
1:19:56|1:19:58|Smiling, [Zhang Zhongfa] handed something to the heavily wounded soldier lying beside him.
1:19:58|1:19:58|The wounded soldier handed the apple back.
1:20:27|1:20:29|Lao Wang was chatting with the soldiers, and he took out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket.
1:20:51|1:20:55|Lao Wang handed the cigarette to a soldier sitting next to him, and the soldiers passed it on, taking out cigarettes and lighting them up for each other.
1:21:20|1:21:21|Wang Lan walks over.
1:21:21|1:21:23|Zhang Zhongfa looks at the apple.
1:21:50|1:21:57|Lao Wang lowered his head, and Zhang Zhongfa looked at the sack full of radishes.
1:22:8|1:22:13|Soldiers transporting supplies are rushing from the camp to the tunnel one after another.
1:22:15|1:22:27|In a heavily targeted area by the enemy, over a dozen soldiers sacrificed themselves there, with bodies piled up like small mountains.
1:22:27|1:22:44|The battle log of 1952 recorded that on October 30th, the enemy tightly controlled the entrance of the tunnel, cutting off all communication with the rear. The water inside the tunnel decreased day by day.
1:23:0|1:23:4|At night, two soldiers shook hands with [Zhang Zhongfa] and crawled out of the tunnel.
1:23:4|1:23:6|Cautiously crawling forward.
1:23:9|1:23:19|One soldier carrying several small water bottles and a rifle, while another one carrying a water tank with a hand grenade, constantly sweeping back and forth with a searchlight.
1:23:19|1:23:26|Every crawl of the soldiers was extremely difficult in order to avoid exposure.
1:23:26|1:23:29|Finally, they arrived at the edge of the pond filled with corpses.
1:23:41|1:24:0|They urgently used their hands to scoop up water and feed it into their mouths. At this moment, a gun emerged between the sandbags beside them. Our soldier, Zhang Zhongfa, was unaware as they quickly took out a large water bottle to fill it with water. The gun fired a bullet, and our soldier was fatally shot.
1:24:1|1:24:8|The newly filled water jug spilled next to the soldier, water gushing out.
1:24:8|1:24:16|In the tunnel, water was seeping down the rock walls, and the soldiers lined up, tilting their heads back and opening their mouths to catch the water.
1:24:16|1:24:24|One of the soldiers attempted to pry open the rock wall with his injured hand, but failed. He licked his lips and walked away disappointed.
1:24:29|1:24:39|The soldiers were so thirsty that they couldn't speak, their lips cracked, their eyes staring blankly, sitting on the ground resting against the mountain wall.
1:24:39|1:24:48|A soldier gently wipes his lips with a damp cloth and then hands the wet cloth to his comrade beside him.
1:25:0|1:25:5|[Zhang Zhongfa] and [Chen Dehou] are resting side by side.
1:25:5|1:25:10|[Zhang Zhongfa] licked his lips and sat up slightly straight.
1:25:10|1:25:13|Seeing everyone with colorful eyebrows, [Zhang Zhongfa] lay down again.
1:25:34|1:25:35|[Zhang Zhongfa] nudged [Chen Dehou]'s arm with his elbow.
1:25:35|1:25:35|[Zhang Zhongfa] nodded with a smile.
1:26:1|1:26:6|He lifted [Chen Dehou] up, and [Chen Dehou] smiled and took off his hat.
1:26:9|1:26:18|[Chen Dehou] placed the box beside him, stepped on it with one foot, touched his chin with his left hand, patted the box with his right hand, and shook his head.
1:26:32|1:26:33|On that day, it was approaching noon, the scorching sun was overhead, the weather was hot and dry, everyone was tired and thirsty from walking.
1:26:34|1:26:34|As soon as they heard there were sour plums, everyone got excited.
1:27:1|1:27:4|Run forward, and when you reach under that tree, you see those plums are round and big, but they are more green than yellow. Everyone couldn't care less whether they are ripe or not, they just pick them and take a bite. The moment they bite down, they feel the sourness spreading through their teeth, gums, cheeks, and under their tongue, with a mouthful of sour juice flowing. It's truly extremely sour.
1:27:32|1:27:34|The soldiers sat up straight, listening attentively.
1:27:34|1:27:35|[Chen Dehou] puts on a hat and lies down.
1:27:35|1:27:35|[Zhang Zhongfa] smiled at [Chen Dehou].
1:27:35|1:27:37|The soldiers also chatted.
1:28:32|1:28:32|The soldier wanted to take a photo from the pocket of [Meng Degui] on the dead sea, but he refused.
1:28:32|1:28:33|[Zhang Zhongfa] pointed a blade of grass directly at [Chen Dehou]'s chin, [Chen Dehou] picked up a cup, turned it upside down and poured it out, not a drop of water came out.
1:29:37|1:29:42|Yang Decai lay on the side behind [Zhang Zhongfa], writing in his diary.
1:29:42|1:29:43|[Yang Decai] turned over.
1:30:1|1:30:2|[Zhang Zhongfa] imagined and smiled contentedly.
1:30:2|1:30:3|Soldiers gathered in small groups, some were helping their comrades mend clothes.
1:30:30|1:30:34|[Meng Degui] was fantasizing while nibbling on dry rations, and ended up choking on them.
1:31:0|1:31:0|At this moment, [Wang Lan] is patrolling by the beds of the wounded soldiers, covering them with blankets.
1:31:0|1:31:1|Suddenly, feeling dizzy, he stood still and rested for a while, holding his forehead.
1:31:1|1:31:1|He slowly walked to the bedside of [Meng Degui].
1:31:32|1:31:35|Picking up the alarm clock on the bedside table, he looked at the time.
1:31:35|1:31:35|[Wang Lan] tidied up the quilt for [Meng Degui].
1:31:35|1:31:35|[Wang Lan] sits down.
1:32:3|1:32:5|[Meng Degui] put his hand on Wang Lan's shoulder, and after thinking for a moment, Wang Lan said no.
1:33:27|1:33:30|At home, [Meng Degui] shook his head with a smile.
1:34:11|1:34:11|[Meng Degui] tilted his head and passed out.
1:34:12|1:34:12|Wang Lan quickly poured water into his mouth with a water bottle.
1:34:12|1:34:12|[Meng Degui] wakes up.
1:35:3|1:35:7|Wang Lan raised her head sorrowfully, locked eyes with a merchant supporting [Meng Degui], and furrowed her brows in contemplation.
1:35:7|1:35:9|At this moment, [Zhang Zhongfa] and [Chen Dehou] are sitting side by side on the edge of the bed.
1:35:35|1:35:35|[Zhang Zhongfa] shook his head.
1:35:36|1:35:36|[Zhang Zhongfa] leaned his elbow on the bed, lost in thought.
1:35:58|1:36:9|He looked around, picked up a pack of cookies next to him, broke it in half, and handed one half to [Chen Dehou].
1:36:29|1:36:32|[Zhang Zhongfa] had chapped lips and ate the biscuits with great effort.
1:36:32|1:36:39|The biscuit was too dry, and he hadn't had any water for many days, making it very difficult to chew.
1:36:39|1:36:45|Swallowing was extremely difficult, with biscuit crumbs constantly falling out of [Zhang Zhongfa]'s mouth.
1:36:45|1:36:50|[Chen Dehou] and [Yang Decai], along with other soldiers, watched as the platoon leader ate in pain, all furrowing their brows.
1:36:53|1:36:56|But in the end, Zhang Zhongfa managed to swallow the biscuit with great effort.
1:36:59|1:36:59|[Zhang Zhongfa] patted [Chen Dehou]'s thigh with a smile.
1:37:30|1:37:35|[Zhang Zhongfa] lowered his head in discomfort.
1:37:35|1:37:46|Outside the tunnel, a soldier carrying a water tank on his back lay on the ground to avoid enemy shells, then threw a grenade at the enemy, and immediately stood up and rushed into the tunnel.
1:37:46|1:37:48|Soldiers in the tunnel rushed to the tunnel entrance to help.
1:37:54|1:37:59|[Zhang Zhongfa] walks over, the soldier salutes. [Zhang Zhongfa] shakes his hand and leads him into the tunnel.
1:37:59|1:38:2|[Wang Lan] is smiling and filling water with several soldiers, then suddenly stands up.
1:38:27|1:38:31|Several soldiers carrying buckets followed [Wang Lan] to the bedside of [Meng Degui].
1:38:31|1:38:35|[Zhang Zhongfa] handed a porcelain cup of sugar water to the commander, and all the soldiers gathered around.
1:38:35|1:38:36|[Zhang Zhongfa] sits by [Meng Degui]'s bed.
1:39:29|1:39:34|Five battles, a plate of fried noodles, a handful of blood.
1:39:56|1:39:56|[Meng Degui] fainted again.
1:40:44|1:40:49|[Meng Degui] slowly raised his hand, wanting to remove the bandage from his eyes.
1:40:51|1:40:52|[Wang Lan] stood up and gently removed the bandage wrapped around Instructor Zhang Zhongfa's head.
1:41:13|1:41:14|[Meng Degui] has left forever.
1:41:14|1:41:14|[Zhang Zhongfa] covers the blanket for him.
1:41:47|1:42:5|The soldiers all took off their hats and observed a moment of silence. Faced with the sudden passing of Instructor [Meng Degui], the faces of soldiers like [Zhang Zhongfa] and [Chen Dehou] were filled with sorrow.
1:42:46|1:42:54|[Meng Degui], with his eyes tightly closed, lay quietly on the hospital bed, only his eyes moving.
1:43:40|1:43:45|On the other side, the enemy is digging above the tunnel, trying to break through.
1:43:45|1:43:49|In the tunnel, soldiers are holding their guns, ready for battle.
1:43:49|1:43:54|Above the tunnel, soil kept falling down, and [Zhang Zhongfa] listened to the sound above his head.
1:44:31|1:44:33|The enemy army blew up the tunnel.
1:44:33|1:44:41|Soldiers threw gas grenades into the tunnel, while others picked up machine guns and fired outward through the hole blown open by the enemy.
1:44:41|1:44:42|[Commander] shouted.
1:44:42|1:44:55|[Commander] quickly put on the mask, and bent down to wet the towel with water, and distributed it to the soldiers.
1:44:55|1:44:57|Soldiers cover the mouths of the severely wounded with towels.
1:45:1|1:45:7|The towel is not enough, [Wang Lan] took off her own mask and handed it to the soldier.
1:45:7|1:45:11|The soldier operating the machine gun, Zhang Zhongfa, did not have a gas mask and was overcome by the poison gas.
1:45:11|1:45:18|[Zhang Zhongfa] ran over, grabbed the machine gun, held his breath, and sprayed outward from the blasted opening.
1:45:18|1:45:25|[Wang Lan] was about to tie a towel around his face when he saw [Zhang Zhongfa], hurriedly approached him, and covered his mouth and nose with the towel.
1:45:39|1:45:49|The artillery received the message and fired at the enemy above the trench, driving them away.
1:45:49|1:45:52|[Wang Lan] fainted, and [Zhang Zhongfa] helped him up.
1:45:55|1:45:59|At this moment, [Wang Lan] leaned on [Yang Decai], with everyone gathered around him. [Zhang Zhongfa] stood in front of him, while [Wang Lan] took a sip of water.
1:46:29|1:46:30|The pedestrian operator wearing headphones listens carefully to the instructions.
1:46:51|1:47:6|[Zhang Zhongfa] and [Chen Dehou] embraced each other excitedly, lifted up by the enthusiastic soldiers. The soldiers hugged each other, some even rolled on the ground while others took off their hats and waved them in the air.
1:47:6|1:47:12|[Wang Lan] joyfully pounded [Yang Decai]'s chest, while the soldiers wiped their machine guns and bullet casings.
1:47:20|1:47:32|Wang Lan was startled, clenching his fists and waving them, but saw Captain Zhang Zhongfa turn his back to wipe away tears, leaving everyone stunned.
1:47:32|1:47:44|Back at the camp, the [commander] tightly embraced [Zhang Zhongfa], joyfully patting his back, while Zheng Wei stood by, tears glistening in his eyes.
1:47:44|1:47:51|[The commander] patted Zhang Zhongfa on the shoulder, then walked up to Yang Decai.
1:48:9|1:48:11|[Yang Decai] shyly lowered his head.
1:48:13|1:48:16|[Commander] led [Zhang Zhongfa] to the wall.
1:48:18|1:48:24|Zheng Wei pulls back the curtain, revealing a map of the situation.
1:48:43|1:48:44|Zheng Wei picked up the phone.
1:49:39|1:49:43|Lao Wang put his arm around [Yang Decai].
1:49:43|1:49:45|In the room, [Zhang Zhongfa] and [Yang Decai] are sleeping on the same bed.
1:50:4|1:50:15|The two men were still asleep when [Commander] walked in, sat down on the chair beside their bed, and began to massage their hands and feet.
1:50:22|1:50:30|[Yang Decai] placed his hand on [Zhang Zhongfa], who then removed his arm and flipped over.
1:50:30|1:50:36|[The commander] looked at his watch, stood up, and walked to the bedside of [Zhang Zhongfa].
1:50:36|1:50:40|[Zhang Zhongfa] immediately stood up and put on his coat.
1:51:12|1:51:24|[Yang Decai] also woke up. You will understand very clearly that the main peak is the key position of the entire battlefield. If we fail to capture it on time, [Zhang Zhongfa] nods solemnly.
1:51:47|1:52:6|The battle quickly began. The artillery of the volunteers reached an unprecedented scale. On the two hills of less than four square kilometers at Shangganling, the volunteers brought in the Second Artillery Division and other artillery units, concentrating more than 170 large and medium-caliber guns, as well as 24 Katyusha rocket launchers.
1:52:8|1:52:26|The volunteer army is well prepared and determined to win. The cannons on the hillside keep firing shells towards the enemy positions without stopping. Relying on the air superiority controlled by fighter jets, the enemy forces are suppressed and defeated by the fierce artillery fire of the volunteer army. Thick smoke covers the sky, and enemy soldiers are fleeing frantically on the mountain.
1:52:27|1:52:29|[Zhang Zhongfa] returned to the tunnel.
1:52:29|1:52:44|Outside, the gunfire was intense, while inside the trenches, soldiers were either eating, drinking water or alcohol, or resting and smoking cigarettes, all appearing calm and fearless, preparing for the final counterattack to support the troops.
1:53:2|1:53:27|It's almost six o'clock, [Zhang Zhongfa] and the soldiers are lined up in a single file at the entrance of the tunnel, each soldier looking ahead with determination. Under the smoke of gunpowder, their skin is rough and dark, their wrinkled military uniforms covered with Chinese characters, mud spots, and bloodstains, yet they appear so lovely and respectable.
1:53:34|1:53:43|A soldier placed a small squirrel in the palm of [Wang Lan], who smiled as he watched it climb up his arm.
1:53:43|1:53:52|[Zhang Zhongfa] frowned and glanced at his watch. There were only ten seconds left until six o'clock. With a wave of his hand, the soldiers immediately rushed out of the tunnel.
1:54:0|1:54:1|In the tunnel.
1:54:27|1:54:29|Good news kept coming from the front.
1:54:50|1:54:54|[Zhang Zhongfa] looked at his watch, took the water bottle, and took a big sip of water.
1:54:54|1:54:57|On the hillside, [Chen Dehou] led the soldiers to continue the assault.
1:54:57|1:54:59|The higher we go, the more intense the enemy's firepower becomes.
1:54:59|1:55:3|After arriving at Area 2, the casualties began to increase significantly.
1:55:3|1:55:5|[Chen Dehou] is lying on the ground, looking up to scout the enemy situation.
1:55:5|1:55:10|In the main peak cliff, the enemy's newly built bunker is continuously shooting at the assault team.
1:55:10|1:55:14|The assault teams of the Eighth Company and other companies can only lie down collectively and cannot move forward.
1:55:15|1:55:20|Chen Dehou sent two soldiers to blow up, but they were shot before they could take a few steps.
1:55:20|1:55:25|[Zhang Zhongfa] checked his watch and saw that it was already 7:30. Chen Dehou sent two more soldiers up the mountain for demolition, but they were also shot by the enemy.
1:55:25|1:55:28|The second demolition team failed again.
1:55:48|1:55:53|[Zhang Zhongfa] looks down at his watch, it is now 7:45.
1:55:53|1:55:56|He paced back and forth anxiously.
1:55:56|1:56:0|[Yang Decai] looked at the platoon leader of the Duobu with a worried expression on his face.
1:56:0|1:56:6|On the hill where the camp is located, [Commander] observes the battle with binoculars, his expression equally anxious.
1:56:6|1:56:12|The chief of staff came over to report that the third explosion in the tunnel was unsuccessful.
1:56:14|1:56:19|[Zhang Zhongfa] looked at [Yang Decai], thought for a moment, [Yang Decai] put down his gun, took off the grenade on his body, water bottle, straightened his hat, saluted to [Zhang Zhongfa], and then set off.
1:56:19|1:56:20|[Zhang Zhongfa] returned the gesture.
1:56:48|1:56:51|Yang Decai rushed out of the tunnel with an explosive barrel.
1:56:51|1:57:0|He stood on the hillside, shouting into the pit.
1:57:0|1:57:7|Yang Decai and Mao Sihai are dodging enemy snipers, constantly charging towards the top of the mountain.
1:57:7|1:57:12|They alternated between leaping up and charging forward and lying down and rolling over, moving swiftly and agilely.
1:57:18|1:57:22|[Zhang Zhongfa] and Wang Lan walked out of the tunnel by chance.
1:57:22|1:57:24|Observing their situation from behind cover.
1:57:24|1:57:36|[Yang Decai] continued to charge forward, while Mao Sihai found a suitable position to lie down, setting up a machine gun in the rear to cover him.
1:57:36|1:57:37|Mao Sihai was hit.
1:57:40|1:57:50|[Yang Decai] glanced back at Mao Sihai, just as he stood up, his chest was also hit.
1:57:50|1:57:55|He struggled to lift his head and crawled laboriously.
1:57:55|1:58:0|Maosihai also endured the severe pain, continuously firing the machine gun to clear the way for [Yang Decai].
1:58:2|1:58:23|[Yang Decai] gritted his teeth and held his chest as he continued to run up, being hit by a bullet once again. He fell behind a breakthrough, and [the commander] glanced at his watch, only five minutes left until eight o'clock. [Zhang Zhongfa] also anxiously clenched his fists as bullet after bullet hit Mao Sihai, who weakly buried his head.
1:58:23|1:58:28|He made another effort to lift his head and adjust the machine gun, but he still fell down.
1:59:9|1:59:17|At this moment, [Zhang Zhongfa] set up a heavy machine gun in the rear, firing at the bunker to share the firepower with [Yang Decai].
1:59:17|1:59:23|Under the cover of [Zhang Zhongfa], [Yang Decai] suddenly stood up and quickly ran towards the bunker.
1:59:23|1:59:28|He unscrewed the cover of the fuse, pulled out the igniter, and stuffed the explosive barrel into the machine gun hole of the bunker.
1:59:28|1:59:32|But the explosive barrel was quickly thrown out of the bunker by the enemy.
1:59:32|1:59:39|[Yang Decai] climbed up the bunker once again, forcefully stuffing the explosive barrel into the bunker and using his own body to block the machine gun hole.
1:59:42|1:59:45|At the last moment of his life, [Yang Decai] turned around and shouted.
1:59:45|1:59:49|[Zhang Zhongfa] issued the order, and all soldiers began to charge forward.
1:59:49|1:59:53|Without the obstruction of the bunker, the [Commander]’s major counterattack is now unstoppable.
1:59:53|1:59:58|The hillside is densely packed with [officers].
1:59:58|2:0:2|Mao Sihai watched as his comrades charged towards the mountain peak and closed his eyes.
2:0:10|2:0:20|Finally, the soldiers holding the big flag reached the mountaintop, kicked away the enemy's flag, and planted our army's tattered flag with numerous holes on the mountaintop.
2:0:20|2:0:27|[Zhang Zhongfa] successfully completed the mission and handed over the position to a soldier from the follow-up troops.
2:0:36|2:0:54|[Zhang Zhongfa] saluted the soldier, and the commander, political commissar, and chief of staff also led the soldiers to the position.
2:0:54|2:0:56|[Zhang Zhongfa] summoned the soldiers to gather at the top of the mountain.
2:1:2|2:1:12|[Zhang Zhongfa] salutes to [Commander], the political commissar, and the chief of staff standing in front of the formation, reviewing this heroic company.
2:1:12|2:1:20|With the platoon leader Zhang Zhongfa, the squad leader Chen Dehou, and the signalman Wang Lan, Eighth Company only has nine soldiers left in the platoon.
2:1:29|2:1:36|[Commander] paced back and forth, looking at the soldiers' faces, unable to speak for a long time.
2:1:36|2:1:44|He walked up to the soldiers and shook hands with each of them solemnly.
2:1:44|2:1:55|After experiencing this life-and-death battle, the soldiers remained spirited, with determined expressions, standing upright with their guns held high.
2:1:55|2:1:57|[Wang Lan] is at the end of the line.
2:2:9|2:2:27|[Commander] shook hands with [Wang Lan], then walked up to [Zhang Zhongfa] and shook his hand. [Zhang Zhongfa] had two water bottles hanging on him. [Commander] understood that [Yang Decai] had sacrificed himself. He looked sad and glanced at the eight soldiers.
2:2:35|2:2:59|[Zhang Zhongfa] led the troops down the mountain, and everyone walked to a big tree with smiles on their faces. [Wang Lan] released the little squirrel, and it climbed up the tree trunk.
2:2:59|2:3:0|The battle log of 1952 reads.
