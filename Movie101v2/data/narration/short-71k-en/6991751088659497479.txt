0:2:22|0:2:29|The henchmen obediently reversed the car slowly, and stopped the car by the roadside upon seeing the gesture from [Zhang Hua]. [Zhang Hua] got out of the car with a walkie-talkie in hand.
0:5:16|0:5:45|[Zhang Hua] smiled without saying a word. Knowing that the people around him were kidnappers, [Mr. Wu] remained calm and thoughtful. The car sped towards the outskirts on the highway at 1 am. 18 hours and 20 minutes after the incident, [Zhang Hua] was arrested. In the police station, two deputy captains, [Xing Feng] and [Cao Gang], were interrogating [Zhang Hua].
0:6:30|0:6:55|Cao Gang finished speaking and patted Zhang Hua's shoulder as if to remind him. Zhang Hua fell silent for a moment and then nodded calmly. The hand behind him, clenched into a fist and turning purple, slowly opened. He then stared at the monitor with a firm gaze and asked, while on the other end of the monitor, Captain Zhang Guozheng and Deputy Captain Li Jiehui watched the interrogation room with serious expressions. However, even the experienced duo were at a loss facing the tight-lipped Zhang Hua.
0:6:56|0:7:3|The detective next to the monitor looked at [Zhang Hua] and said,
0:8:44|0:8:49|The detective in the monitoring room carefully laid out the weapons from the bag one by one.
0:8:56|0:9:5|After speaking, he sighed and lowered his head when he saw the look in Captain's eyes.
0:9:43|0:10:2|[Zhang Hua] frowned as he recalled the situation in the car that night. The driver's henchmen kept overtaking, causing everyone in the car to sway and struggle to breathe. [Mr. Wu] asked,
0:10:36|0:10:50|[Zhang Hua] thought for a moment, realizing it had nothing to do with saving people, so he began to recall openly. Twenty days before the incident, at the China-Russia border, [Zhang Hua] and an informant were waiting by the river for a Russian arms dealer. Soon, two Russian men came down from a jeep.
0:11:0|0:11:7|The arms dealer became suspicious when he saw Mr. Wu being so happy.
0:11:24|0:11:46|To prove to the arms dealer, [Zhang Hua] took out a dagger and stabbed it into the arm of the captive. The arms dealer was stunned by this scene and quickly agreed to the demands, allowing [Zhang Hua] to pick up the weapon. After spraying with a machine gun, he threw a hand grenade into the icy lake, watching the water column soar into the sky.
0:11:46|0:11:59|[Zhang Hua] praised in Russian with just one sentence, [Zhang Hua] drove away satisfied after the deal, while the informant sitting in the back seat was pale and barely breathing.
0:12:45|0:12:51|Realizing that he had let slip a secret, [Mr. Wu]...
0:13:49|0:13:58|When [Zhang Hua] accidentally revealed the secret, he couldn't come up with a good strategy in the face of such intense questioning. After pondering for a while, he smiled and said to the three serious captains,
0:13:59|0:14:8|The narration then began to describe the process of kidnapping Xiao Dou. The day before the incident, a group of people led by [Zhang Hua] disguised themselves as police officers and intercepted Xiao Dou, who was driving a sports car.
0:15:1|0:15:7|[Xing Feng] walked towards the door, and the time on the wall was already 8:03 in the evening.
0:15:16|0:15:40|After the captain, who is skilled in psychological warfare, left with those words, Guozi placed a box of hot dumplings in front of [Zhang Hua]. [Xing Feng] also walked up behind him, unlocked the handcuffs on [Zhang Hua]'s back, and pulled his numb arm to the front. Facing the inevitable situation, [Xing Feng] cautiously handcuffed [Zhang Hua]'s hands in front, then opened the lid and said to [Zhang Hua],
0:15:52|0:16:0|Without blinking an eye, Mr. Wu stared at [Zhang Hua] for a long time. Just as Xing Feng walked out of the interrogation room, Guo Zi caught up and said,
0:16:10|0:16:16|Cao Gang in the control room closely watches every move of Zhang Hua.
0:16:17|0:16:22|At this moment, [Zhang Hua] in the control room suddenly looked up at the monitor with his mouth half open, as if wanting to say something.
0:16:29|0:16:46|The eagerly anticipating crowd became even more nervous when they heard that [Zhang Hua] did not disclose any details of the case. It seemed like [Zhang Hua], who was teasing the police, was about to put a dumpling in his mouth but missed, dropping it on the ground. After a moment of confusion, [Zhang Hua] recalled what happened 45 minutes after the incident.
0:16:52|0:17:0|Finally arrived at a deserted courtyard, [Zhang Hua] couldn't help but laugh when looking at [Mr. Wu], then asked Da Wei who was left behind.
0:17:20|0:17:30|Dawei and Xiaolei led [Mr. Wu] into the cabin, chatting as they walked.
0:20:13|0:20:20|Mr. Wu, with tears in his eyes, tried to save Xiao Dou in a kind-hearted manner. After hearing this, Zhang Hua looked at Mr. Wu sharply for a long time before saying,
0:20:46|0:20:52|After seeing Cangzi slowly raise his hand, Mr. Wu, with veins bulging on his forehead, finally breathed a sigh of relief.
0:21:14|0:21:21|Mr. Wu stared firmly into Zhang Hua's eyes, and after a moment, Zhang Hua helped Mr. Wu onto the bed as if in agreement.
0:21:25|0:21:45|His men helped the flushed Xiao Dou up and removed the wire from his neck in unison. [Mr. Wu] struggled to sit up from the bed, comforting Xiao Dou by patting his head, worried that the commotion just now might attract passersby. Cangzi went out with a machine gun to patrol the area.
0:21:45|0:21:50|On the other side, the police found the vehicle they used during the kidnapping through surveillance footage from the traffic department.
0:22:0|0:22:7|And in the police station, Chief Cheng immediately recognized Zhang Hua from the criminal records database, pointing at the screen excitedly.
0:22:47|0:22:58|[Zhang Hua] agreed to [Mr. Wu]'s request. While the young man was struggling with handcuffs, [Mr. Wu] also took into account what Xiaodou had said, but this level of comfort seemed minimal to Xiaodou, who had already been beaten.
0:25:43|0:26:4|[Zhang Hua] kept turning the pistol in his hand while deep in thought. After considering it carefully, he asked, and upon learning of [Mr. Wu]'s whereabouts, [Zhang Hua] drove alone to his destination. Meanwhile, [Cao Gang] and Cheng rushed to [Mr. Wu]'s apartment.
0:26:30|0:26:53|With his head down, [Mr. Wu] suddenly looked up at the innocent Xiao Dou, [Mr. Wu] didn't say anything. At that moment, Cangzi, who was playing cards in the corridor, heard [Mr. Wu]'s cough and walked in with a Coke and a cup. [Mr. Wu] looked cautiously at the Coke poured into the cup and said,
0:27:3|0:27:9|In this particularly cold winter, [Mr. Wu] still nodded.
0:27:22|0:27:28|Da Wei looked at the cola in his hand that he had just taken a sip of, feeling uncomfortable, he changed to a clean cup and started pumping well water.
0:27:59|0:28:24|At this moment, [Zhang Hua] in Mr. Wu's apartment carefully opened the bedroom door, cautiously entered the password for the safe. Meanwhile, [Cao Gang], with the unclear memory of the route, was wandering near the apartment. [Zhang Hua] took out two stacks of cash and a bank card from the safe.
0:28:27|0:28:38|[Cao Gang] was still spinning around non-stop, while [Zhang Hua] had already started drinking beer in the apartment, feeling very relaxed. At this moment, [Zhang Hua] began imitating the actions of [Mr. Wu] in the magazine.
0:29:7|0:29:36|[Zhang Hua] hung up the phone satisfactorily, picked up the DV on the table, kicked the broken electric heater in [Mr. Wu]'s small room, David and Xiao Lei also went to the yard to use the restroom. Unable to bear the cold in the small room, Cangzi stood the machine gun by the cabinet, took out a screwdriver and started fixing it on the ground. Meanwhile, in the apartment, [Zhang Hua] was surprisingly interested in filming with the DV in the room. When he filmed the photos on the cabinet, he put down the DV in his hand.
0:29:37|0:29:42|He couldn't help but gasp at the group photo of [Mr. Wu] and his comrades.
0:29:42|0:30:6|At this moment, [Mr. Wu] sitting on the edge of the bed stared at the machine gun by the cabinet, as if planning something. He looked at the back of the warehouse, gently moving his body closer to the direction of the machine gun. When he was about to squat down to pick up the gun, he found his clothes being pulled. Turning around, he saw Xiao Dou tied to him, tightly holding onto his clothes. [Mr. Wu] carefully pushed Xiao Dou's hand away and gestured to him. Seeing Xiao Dou calm down a lot,
0:30:6|0:30:24|[Mr. Wu] slowly reached out towards the machine gun, but with a slight movement, the iron chains tied to the two men would make a sound. Looking at the warehouse where the electric heater was still being hammered, [Mr. Wu] gestured for Xiao Dou to come closer to him. Then, [Mr. Wu] gritted his teeth and reached out his hand, but the distance to the machine gun was still far away.
0:30:24|0:30:44|[Mr. Wu] held his breath again and tried several times, but facing a distance of less than a meter, the slight movement was of no use. Seeing the bunker about to be repaired, knowing there was only one chance, [Mr. Wu] suddenly sat on the ground and kicked the bottom of the machine gun with his foot, causing the machine gun to fall on [Mr. Wu]. [Mr. Wu] skillfully shot down the two gunmen who reacted.
0:30:44|0:30:56|Immediately aiming at the door, Da Wei, who had just rushed in, was shot and flew into the yard by several shots. Xiao Lei seized the opportunity when [Mr. Wu] was shooting and hit his shoulder, then he leaned out and shot dead the crouching Xiao Dou with one shot.
0:30:56|0:31:18|But at this moment, a phone rang, interrupting Mr. Wu's reverie. Upon hearing the ring, Mr. Wu immediately withdrew his hand that was reaching for the gun, sat back down on the ground, and took out two iron chains from the drawer, saying to Dawei and Xiaolei,
0:31:19|0:31:24|After wandering around for a while, [Cao Gang] arrived at the entrance of [Mr. Wu]'s apartment with the police.
0:31:26|0:31:31|After finding nothing in the raid, the detective reported to [Cao Gang] about the landline in the apartment.
0:32:15|0:32:24|25 days before the incident, [Zhang Hua] and his gang arrived at the arcade and found Kong Lao'er, who was playing games.
0:34:20|0:34:34|Boss Kong sat in the car at a loss, and [Xing Feng] then found the prison guard Yu Guohui with a recorded phone call. [Zhang Hua] returned to the cabin after getting the card.
0:35:12|0:35:35|[Zhang Hua] watched as [Mr. Wu], with his face flushed and veins bulging, gestured for Cangzi to let go. Xiao Dou, who was holding onto Cangzi's hand, also received a hard slap. [Zhang Hua] watched as [Mr. Wu], lying on the bed gasping for breath, approached and helped the now powerless [Mr. Wu] sit up slowly with their combined effort. [Zhang Hua] took out the bank card from his pocket that he had retrieved from the safe and said to [Mr. Wu],
0:35:46|0:35:51|Mr. Wu admitted that he couldn't hide it anymore.
0:36:33|0:36:51|Upon hearing that a video was going to be recorded, the person sitting behind [Mr. Wu] quickly got up to avoid it. [Mr. Wu] remained silent at first, bowing his head. After a moment of silence, he finally spoke to the camera, but quickly changed the subject.
0:37:7|0:37:13|[Mr. Wu] took the DV camera and pretended to press a button before suddenly smashing it on the ground.
0:38:4|0:38:8|Mr. Wu's resolute gaze and tough attitude clearly intimidated the bandits.
0:38:8|0:38:27|After listening to Mr. Wu's emotional speech, Zhang Hua was at a loss for a moment. As the leader, he didn't know what to say after looking at his men. He pulled Mr. Wu and Xiao Dou, who had just been pushed onto the bed, up. Xiao Dou curled up timidly against Mr. Wu's shoulder. Mr. Wu, who had calmed down a bit, was afraid that Xing Feng would harm him.
0:38:27|0:38:34|Quickly shifting the focus to the money aspect, [Mr. Wu] said,
0:39:11|0:39:38|In an instant, Kong's henchmen and [Zhang Hua] were wrestling together. [Zhang Hua] was surprised that Mr. Kong, with a gun to his head, was still resisting fiercely. When they struggled for the gun, it accidentally went off and hit a pillar. While [Zhang Hua] was stunned, one of Kong's henchmen tackled him from behind. [Zhang Hua] and the henchman fled in panic, with Mr. Kong quickly chasing after them, remembering the license plate number.
0:39:43|0:40:5|Cao Gang drove his car and violently crashed into the rear of Zhang Hua's vehicle, causing the car to shatter on the railing, lose balance, and stop in the middle of the street. Xing Feng immediately got out of the car, pressed the escaping Xiao Lei against the police car. At this moment, Zhang Hua restarted the vehicle and recklessly drove towards another street. Xing Feng's attention was drawn to the vehicle, allowing Xiao Lei to break free from him. Xiao Lei agilely flipped over the fence in the middle of the road in order to shake off Xing Feng.
0:40:5|0:40:21|The driver who didn't have time to step on the brakes quickly turned the steering wheel to one side, causing multiple cars to collide. Xiao Lei saw that [Xing Feng] was about to catch up with him, so he bravely crossed the road without fear of danger. Just as he was about to pass, he was hit and thrown to the ground by a passing truck that couldn't dodge in time. [Xing Feng] quickly rushed forward to stop the truck, arrested Xiao Lei, and then called [Cao Gang].
0:40:31|0:40:42|The final smooth drift into an alley, even with such a tricky route, couldn't shake off the relentless pursuit of [Cao Gang]. Frustrated, [Zhang Hua] recklessly threw a grenade out of the window without considering the consequences.
0:40:44|0:40:52|With the explosion of the hand grenade, the raging fire instantly engulfed the entire alley. [Cao Gang], who had no hope of pursuit, quickly got out of the car and fired several shots ahead.
0:41:1|0:41:24|Fifteen days before the incident, the police arrested Qiangzi, who had just come out of the hair salon. Qiangzi truthfully confessed his involvement in the process in the car, and that night the police captured Gangzi at the hotel.
0:41:34|0:41:48|Three hours after the incident, [Zhang Hua] called his comrade Mr. Wu using Mr. Wu's phone. Mr. Wu answered the phone in a half-awake state.
0:42:1|0:42:10|Mr. Su, who was in a daze, suddenly woke up. He sat up in bed and asked,
0:42:53|0:43:8|After Mr. Wu, who understood the hint, was hung up on, he promptly picked up the landline and called the police. Moments later, Zhang Hua called Mr. Wu again.
0:43:41|0:43:49|Late at night, after [Zhang Hua] and the others fell asleep, [Mr. Wu] and Xiao Dou were chatting together.
0:44:26|0:44:33|In the drafty little house, the cold wind was piercing. Xiao Dou couldn't help but cough a few times.
0:46:21|0:46:43|[Zhang Hua] nodded slightly in admiration. As the few people in the cabin gradually fell asleep, the heart-pounding night slowly came to an end. The bustling city also quieted down in the cold air. Even at 7 o'clock in the morning, the entire city was still shrouded in darkness. Inside [Mr. Su]'s house, [Xing Feng] who was waiting for the kidnappers to call, received a text message from his wife. The message read,
0:46:47|0:46:52|[Xing Feng] looked at it and didn't reply, then put his phone in his pocket and continued to wait.
0:46:52|0:47:3|Meanwhile, [Cao Gang], who was acting separately, woke up Wei Zi who was sleeping on the table in the traffic control center. Wei Zi, who was used to this rhythm, quickly immersed himself in his work.
0:47:12|0:47:18|Upon waking up, [Zhang Hua] looked at the poster of [Mr. Wu] on the wall and asked,
0:48:23|0:48:41|[Zhang Hua] smiled without saying a word after listening. The morning was not yet fully bright, but the city's cleaners were already working in pairs to clean up the trash left by people the night before. As the scattered people on the bus gradually became crowded, a new day officially began. People rushed around the streets and alleys of the city for work.
0:48:42|0:49:5|Some people enter high-rise buildings five days a week, while others work year-round, yet still open their shops on time, quietly waiting for customers to arrive. As these seemingly similar yet different people bustle about, the city becomes lively again. Meanwhile, [Mr. Wu] and Xiao Dou are firmly chained to the bed, with light shining through the curtains onto the chains, making them appear particularly cold.
0:49:7|0:49:15|Mr. Wu, who had stayed up all night, pondered strategies and his gaze became somewhat vacant. At this moment, the alarm clock set for 8:30 on the bed broke the silence.
0:49:22|0:49:56|Upon being woken up by the alarm clock, the group of people released the iron chain from [Mr. Wu]. Xiao Dou noticed and asked about it. Then, Da Wei tried to blindfold [Mr. Wu] from behind. Reluctantly cooperating, [Mr. Wu] had his eyes covered with a cloth and was taken into a car. Meanwhile, the police had already arrived at the bank and deployed tightly around the area. [Cao Gang] and others parked their car in the bank's parking lot, waiting for the right moment. On the high building opposite the bank,
0:49:56|0:50:2|The sniper deployed by the armed police is focusing intently on the business van. The detective says to Mr. Su,
0:50:18|0:50:21|8 hours after the incident, [Mr. Wu] called the bank.
0:50:40|0:50:52|At this moment, Mr. Wu's car passed by a tractor, while Cao Gang and the sniper at the bank entrance kept looking around. The bank manager then said,
0:51:33|0:51:50|Blindfolded, [Mr. Wu] almost hit a bridge pier. After adjusting his position, he felt uncomfortable all over and said to [Zhang Hua],
0:52:9|0:52:18|Mr. Wu heard a tractor passing by on the roadside and cleverly turned his head. Unable to continue, Zhang Hua, who had strong anti-surveillance abilities, saw this and pressed Mr. Wu against the bridge pier.
0:53:2|0:53:10|Mr. Su, who was full of anger, said angrily. The tractor driver reported the situation to the police station on the side of the road.
0:53:10|0:53:18|Mr. Wu returned to the cabin, and Zhang Hua said to him,
0:53:41|0:53:57|[Zhang Hua] fantasizes about a scene of robbing a bank vault. A large truck crashes through the door, and several masked men with machine guns in hand engage in a fierce gunfight with the security guards of the vault. The ruthless and well-armed bandits mercilessly slaughter the armed guards along the way, relentlessly advancing towards the vault door. After eliminating the last armed resistance, they bring the captured manager to the front of the vault door.
0:53:57|0:54:7|After threatening the two administrators for facial recognition, the gate was opened. After imagining it, [Zhang Hua] turned to [Mr. Wu] and said,
0:54:59|0:55:6|After driving the car to the outskirts with some signs of human activity, [Zhang Hua] got into a taxi parked by the roadside.
0:55:22|0:55:41|In the car, [Cao Gang] and other detectives nervously checked the bullets in their guns. As the agreed time approached, the police officers surrounding the area also anxiously observed their surroundings. At that moment, a taxi slowly stopped at the bank entrance. All the police officers were highly focused, ready to rush towards the taxi at any moment to arrest [Zhang Hua].
0:55:42|0:55:56|The undercover police quickly loaded their pistols, at this moment, [Mr. Su] in the car muttered to himself,
0:55:56|0:56:17|[Zhang Hua] opened the car door, the sniper kept his finger on the trigger, staring fixedly at the car door. But after a moment, the sniper took his finger off the trigger. The crowd looked down at the woman who got out of the car, sighed disappointedly, while [Zhang Hua] got out of the car outside the Shangdong Shopping Mall.
0:56:53|0:57:1|[Mr. Su] arrived at the Shangdong Mall as instructed and called [Zhang Hua].
0:57:9|0:57:15|Mr. Su, who is overweight, ignored the gaze of others and bent down to search on the ground.
0:57:31|0:57:38|After venting, Mr. Su subconsciously looked at the trash can, only to find an envelope with Mr. Su's name underneath, containing Mr. Wu's identification and bank cards.
0:58:7|0:58:15|At this time, the police car was being watched by Cao Gang in the yard through a telescope. Before long, Dawei came back with a bag of apples.
0:58:37|0:58:44|On the other side, Mr. Su, who got his bank card at the bank, withdrew cash under the escort of the police according to the instructions.
0:59:16|0:59:22|12 hours after the incident, the police found Bozi in the massage parlor.
0:59:27|0:59:41|Bozi, upon hearing that it was the police, immediately ran away. With a gas canister on his back, Bozi, with his strong body, dashed through the crowd. However, he didn't run far before being tackled to the ground by the police.
1:0:1|1:0:13|Thirteen hours after the incident, [Mr. Wu], wrapped up tightly, boarded the bus with his backpack. Just as he relaxed a bit, [Mr. Wu] turned his head and saw the police on the bus next to him conducting individual inspections.
1:0:17|1:0:42|Coincidentally, [Xing Feng] noticed him at this moment. Uncertain, [Xing Feng] shouted loudly. Upon hearing this, [Mr. Wu] didn't hesitate and quickly ran forward. [Xing Feng] and the senior detective rushed from all directions. Seeing nowhere to escape, [Mr. Wu] desperately climbed over a nearly two-meter high wall onto the road. Agile as he was, [Xing Feng] swiftly climbed over the wall and chased after [Mr. Wu]. Without any hesitation, [Mr. Wu] stepped on the roof of a car, then climbed over a tall fence. Seeing [Mr. Wu] accidentally fall, ...
1:0:42|1:0:48|[Xing Feng] quickly climbed up the fence, and at that moment, [Dongzi] unexpectedly pulled out a gun and aimed it at the falling [Xing Feng].
1:0:48|1:0:56|[Xing Feng] froze at the sight of this moment, and just as the situation was critical, [Cao Gang] shot [Dongzi] in the arm. In the ambulance, [Cao Gang] asked the injured [Dongzi],
1:2:32|1:2:44|Police officers from the Public Security Bureau swarmed out in full force, dividing into dozens of teams to conduct continuous searches within the narrowed scope set by the police. The search area was reduced to a radius of 3 kilometers, but with the large number of people and vehicles in the city of Beijing, finding one person proved to be a challenging task.
1:2:45|1:2:52|Like finding a needle in a haystack. As time passed slowly, night fell over the city once again.
1:3:4|1:3:19|[Guo Zi] wandered around different neighborhoods for a while. Feeling a bit hungry, he bought a bread from the neighborhood convenience store and planned to eat while searching for his car. Just as he was about to open the door, he happened to see [Zhang Hua]'s car parked in a corner. After confirming, [Guo Zi]
1:4:26|1:4:43|Not long after, the area where [Zhang Hua] lived was filled with a large number of plainclothes police officers. Some were hiding in cars, some pretending to be passersby, and some acting as customers buying fruit. But no matter what their identity was, everyone kept an eye on [Zhang Hua]'s vehicle. [Xing Feng] called and asked,
1:5:16|1:5:37|Shortly after, a simulation of a scene of arrest in the residential area began. When [Zhang Hua] came out, [Xing Feng] approached, but was discovered and shot down. Immediately, [Zhang Hua] started shooting indiscriminately at the crowd, causing a large number of police officers and civilians to fall under the intense gunfire. With precise aim, [Cao Gang] hit [Zhang Hua] in the arm. Injured, [Zhang Hua] continued to shoot while retreating behind the car. Despite the intense pain, [Zhang Hua] stubbornly exposed the machine gun.
1:5:37|1:5:42|Firing indiscriminately towards the direction of the gunfire, a large number of innocent civilians who couldn't dodge in time were shot dead.
1:5:42|1:6:14|At this moment, [Cao Gang] calmly fired a shot through the car window, killing [Zhang Hua]. However, at the last moment, [Zhang Hua] still managed to throw a grenade towards the crowd. Just then, Captain Li Jiehui called, and [Zhang Hua] was in the middle of a passionate moment with his girlfriend Chen Chen. With Chen Chen pinned underneath him, she picked up the grenade from the table, ready to throw it away.
1:6:22|1:6:29|[Zhang Hua], with no interest at all, started grooming in the bathroom with a gun and a grenade, while the police officers downstairs remained vigilant without any relaxation.
1:6:29|1:6:40|Guo Ziman casually walked to the side of [Zhang Hua]'s car, looked around, and then squatted next to the tire. He took out a tool he had prepared in advance and loosened the valve of the tire.
1:6:40|1:6:48|Upstairs, [Zhang Hua] put on his clothes after washing up. Sitting on the bed, Chen Chen looked at his back and asked,
1:7:5|1:7:12|After finishing speaking, Mr. Wu placed the gun in Chen Chen's waist, put the grenade in his pocket, took the clothes pressed under Chen Chen, and said seriously,
1:7:24|1:7:33|[Zhang Hua] slapped Chen Chen in the face and said,
1:7:36|1:8:0|After the end of the playful banter between the couple, [Zhang Hua] walked up to the vehicle. The surveillance police officer, upon seeing [Zhang Hua], immediately radioed in. At that moment, Guo Zi looked up towards the building and happened to see Chen Chen watching [Zhang Hua] from the window. Just then, a tricycle accidentally collided with the car that [Xing Feng] was tracking.
1:8:12|1:8:21|After Li Jiehui at the base hung up the phone, he also became nervous. [Zhang Hua], through the rearview mirror, saw him unknowingly following her car and cautiously driving around on the road.
1:8:28|1:8:38|[Zhang Hua] looked in the rearview mirror again after passing a corner and relaxed when he saw that the car was no longer following. He then called [Mr. Wu] in the car, preparing to get the money.
1:9:40|1:10:13|[Zhang Hua] was reminded to find a flat tire, so he stopped by the roadside. After the captain hung up the phone in worry, [Zhang Hua], who was about to get off the car, cautiously picked up the handgun on the passenger seat. The passing lady angrily complained. After [Zhang Hua] surveyed the surroundings, he found a repair shop not far ahead. Helpless, he had to drive the car to the entrance of the repair shop.
1:10:13|1:10:21|Even with a pistol in his pocket, [Zhang Hua] was still uneasy. He even brought a grenade out of the car, with every move of his being monitored by the detective.
1:10:21|1:10:28|Guo Zixiang, who was watching from a distance, said to the ambushers nearby, including [Cao Gang],
1:11:16|1:11:31|After finalizing the battle plan, [Xing Feng] took off his communication headset. Wearing a tattered cotton jacket, [Xing Feng] walked halfway before [Zhang Hua] suddenly turned around. Without any sense of incongruity, [Xing Feng] smoothly sat down at a snack stall. Just as [Zhang Hua] noticed something suspicious, the noisy commotion next to them caught his attention.
1:11:36|1:11:58|[Zhang Hua] watched the commotion for a while without much thought, continuing to wait for the tire to be fixed. When [Xing Feng] saw the opportunity, he took off his coat, grabbed [Zhang Hua] from behind, and slammed him hard to the ground. The police quickly intervened, each performing their duties, pinning [Zhang Hua] down so he couldn't move. The detectives swiftly took away his gun, while [Cao Gang] struggled to snatch the hand grenade from [Zhang Hua].
1:12:2|1:12:7|Even experienced detectives like [Cao Gang] couldn't help but feel a chill down their spine and break out in a cold sweat after hearing his words.
1:12:7|1:12:43|18 hours after the incident, the leader of the kidnapping gang, [Zhang Hua], was captured by the police. As the vehicle stopped at the entrance of the police station, they escorted [Zhang Hua] towards the courtyard, where the senior detective was already waiting. They then proceeded to the interrogation room with the suspect.
1:14:9|1:14:16|The prepared special police officers outside the building rushed in through the window with ropes.
1:14:32|1:14:38|Finally, [Zhang Hua] sat in the interrogation chair, with his hands cuffed behind his back, his ankles and waist securely locked.
1:14:56|1:15:20|[Zhang Hua] nodded, then turned to look at the clock hanging on the wall. Intentionally delaying, [Zhang Hua] looked at the two captains in front of him and began to speak. Starting from the night of the kidnapping, time passed by minute by minute. In the blink of an eye, the clock on the wall showed 8:05 in the evening. As the dumplings in [Zhang Hua]'s hand fell to the ground, the film returned to the beginning.
1:15:22|1:15:39|On the other side, the henchman in the rental room is cooking a pot of instant noodles in the kitchen, while the little Du in the room is sleeping on the bed. [Mr. Wu], on the other hand, is thinking restlessly. At this moment, the phone next to Cangzi rings.
1:15:48|1:16:7|Mr. Wu, full of confusion, asked Dawei, "Cao Gang and Xing Feng just walked into the interrogation room after devising a new interrogation plan in the police station yard. Xing Feng took the lunch box from the table and asked,"
1:17:8|1:17:16|In the control room, Li Jiehui immediately made a phone call to verify. As time drew closer, the anxious Mr. Wu asked Dawei,
1:19:7|1:19:14|In the cramped cabin, the restless Dawei approached [Mr. Wu] and said,
1:19:45|1:19:54|Just then, Cangzi and Xiaolei walked in, and Cangzi said to Dawei. Upon hearing this news, [Mr. Wu] remained as calm and collected as ever.
1:20:58|1:21:7|After receiving the ransom from Boss Kong, the ruthless [Zhang Hua] then said to his subordinates,
1:21:59|1:22:8|The convoy arrived at the hospital entrance in no time. Because [Zhang Hua] was an extremely dangerous bandit, capable of extreme actions at any moment, in order to ensure the safety of everyone around,
1:22:35|1:22:42|Two detectives brought [Zhang Hua] in front of Chen Chen, and after [Cao Gang] gestured for Wei Zi to let go of him, [Zhang Hua] said to Chen Chen,
1:23:10|1:23:18|The police found a foreign object in the crotch area of [Zhang Hua] using a metal detector.
1:23:29|1:23:37|After Cao Gang dragged the detective for inspection, he personally took off [Zhang Hua]'s pants and searched through them. After a moment, Cao Gang locked eyes with [Xing Feng] and slowly raised the key he found.
1:23:48|1:24:5|[Xing Feng] was about to speak when he was interrupted by the vibration of his phone. After getting off the car, the detective handcuffed [Zhang Hua]. Following orders from his superiors, [Xing Feng] got back into the car and said to [Zhang Hua],
1:24:8|1:24:16|In the kitchen of the rental house, Xiao Lei is scooping out two portions of freshly cooked dumplings from the basin. The dumplings, just out of the pot, are steaming hot, looking particularly rich.
1:24:16|1:24:25|In this cold and bleak room, perhaps only these dumplings can bring a hint of warmth to the two. Xiao Lei placed the dumplings in front of them.
1:24:31|1:24:47|The two, who hadn't eaten anything all day, had no appetite for the fragrant dumplings in front of them. The pitiful Xiao Dou, after staring at Mr. Wu for a while, picked up a dumpling and gobbled it down. Mr. Wu, looking at Xiao Dou, also picked up a dumpling as if resigned. But after hesitating for a moment while looking at the dumpling, he asked,
1:24:59|1:25:5|Outside, fireworks were going off.
1:25:8|1:25:30|Xiao Lei did not refute after hearing it, he pulled back the thick curtains, [Mr. Wu] looked through the foggy glass, quietly watching the fireworks outside that kept blooming. At this moment, even the fireworks could only be seen as a silhouette. The sorrow and helplessness surged in his heart, after suppressing the emotions in his heart, he had no more demands, lowered his head and quietly looked at the dumplings in front of him.
1:25:30|1:25:38|Meanwhile, Mr. Su at the police station also opened a plate of dumplings, but after eating one, he lost his appetite.
1:25:38|1:25:46|Upon returning to the courtyard, Dawei and Xiaolei had already started digging a hole. Cangzi put away the bowls and chopsticks and said to the two of them,
1:25:51|1:25:56|Xiao Dou looked at the digital clock on the table showing 8:30, sat on the bed, and couldn't help but burst into tears.
1:25:56|1:26:7|[Mr. Wu], although equally sad, held back his tears and comforted Xiao Dou who was crying beside him.
1:26:23|1:26:31|Xiao Dou trembled and confessed to [Mr. Wu] in a shaky voice,
1:27:29|1:27:35|Da Wei, feeling a bit reluctant, finished speaking and then moved the table in front of the two aside. Cong, who was leaning against the door frame, said to Da Wei,
1:27:46|1:28:9|At this moment, [Cao Gang] and others who had roughly determined the location were rushing towards the village where the cabin was located with a large number of police forces. Inside the cabin, Xiao Dou was leaning on [Mr. Wu] for a sense of security amidst the pervasive smell of death. [Mr. Wu] pressed Xiao Dou's head tightly against his face, stroking her cheek with his hand. Watching Xiao Dou trembling in his arms, the vacant-eyed [Mr. Wu] began to sing his own song.
1:28:31|1:28:40|Singing along, tears also fell from the corner of [Mr. Wu]'s eyes.
1:29:41|1:29:52|After singing the last sentence together, the two of them embraced tightly. Zhang Hua on the police car deliberately stalled for time and said,
1:30:32|1:30:44|The police convoy had turned into a pitch-black narrow road at this moment. Despite the extremely poor lighting conditions, the convoy's speed did not slow down significantly with only the headlights. Before long, they arrived at the village where the cabin was located.
1:30:44|1:30:50|Mr. Wu, after looking at the clock on the table showing 8:48, said to the two people airing the room outside,
1:31:5|1:31:11|Da Wei looked at the clock on the table showing 8:50 and decided to wait a little longer. In the police car, [Xing Feng] said to [Zhang Hua],
1:31:12|1:31:19|The convoy cautiously turned off the headlights and quietly drove into the village.
1:31:22|1:31:48|Upon hearing the sudden barking of a dog, the ongoing argument between [Mr. Cang] and [Xiao Lei] was put aside as they cautiously walked into the yard to investigate. While [Xiao Lei] peered outside through the gap of the gate, [Mr. Cang] went to the other side of the wall to observe the suspicious activities in the resort. Despite his careful watch, [Mr. Cang] failed to notice the detectives who had quietly approached the foot of the mountain. [Xing Feng] and [Cao Gang], along with [Zhang Hua] and a large number of armed police, met up with the chief who had arrived earlier.
1:33:26|1:33:35|[Cao Gang] smiled, then closed the car door and prepared to act. At this moment, with only 4 minutes left until 9 o'clock, [Xing Feng] in the woods grabbed [Cao Gang] and encouraged him, saying,
1:33:38|1:33:44|At this moment, [Cangzi] was still crouching on the wall in the courtyard, watching intently, but his premonition was very bad, and he seemed a bit impatient.
1:33:44|1:33:49|And Da Wei, who was persuaded inside the house, is unlocking the door for [Mr. Wu],
1:34:8|1:34:29|[Mr. Wu] completely gave up struggling, lowered his head, and waited for the final three minutes. When the time reached 58 minutes, [Cangzi] added two more locks to the iron chain of [Xiaodou]. After finishing with [Xiaodou], the only remaining lock was also locked on [Mr. Wu]'s hand. Then [Cangzi] closed the door, took out the iron wire from his pocket, and threw it in front of [Xiaolei].
1:34:46|1:35:0|[Xiao Lei] finally compromised and picked up the iron wire to strangle [Mr. Wu]'s neck. The cold wire tightened around their necks, making it increasingly difficult for them to breathe in just a few seconds.
1:35:2|1:35:14|Due to the poor circulation of blood, both of them had faces flushed red. After a moment, even their eyes were bloodshot. In front of the heavy iron chains and shackles, even if the two of them exerted 200% of their strength, it was of no avail.
1:35:14|1:35:33|[Mr. Wu] stuck out his tongue, the veins on his face bulging, as time passed, [Mr. Wu]'s pupils gradually dilated, losing their luster, the struggling hands and feet of the two also gradually became still, at this moment the whole world seemed to slow down, just then the armed police flipped over the high wall and broke in,
1:35:36|1:35:57|[Xing Feng] and [Cao Gang] almost simultaneously broke through the wooden door fully armed, with [Cao Gang] swiftly pinning [Cangzi], who hadn't reacted yet, firmly against the wall. [Xing Feng] and other armed police quickly subdued [Xiao Lei] and Dawei, the armed police in the courtyard opened the tightly locked gate, and the main force rushed in. In an instant, a large number of armed police surrounded the small courtyard, making it impossible for anyone to escape.
1:35:59|1:36:6|After confiscating the weapons of the three individuals, [Xing Feng] immediately came to [Mr. Wu] and [Xiao Dou] to comfort their emotions.
1:36:6|1:36:30|Just back from a visit to the gates of hell, [Mr. Wu] stood in disbelief as he looked at [Xing Feng] and a large number of armed police in front of him, unable to say a word. After confirming the safety of the two, [Xing Feng] took out a key and unlocked the shackles on them. [Mr. Wu] sat on the ground, still at a loss, with a look of bewilderment in his eyes. An apple on the table rolled to the ground near the box that was pressed down.
1:36:30|1:36:35|And at that moment, the clock on the table, set for 9 o'clock, started ringing.
1:36:35|1:36:41|It is with the ringing of this alarm clock that the 20-hour rescue operation is declared successfully completed.
1:36:41|1:36:47|And for [Mr. Wu], it was like waking up from a nightmare that seemed to have lasted for 20 hours.
1:36:47|1:37:8|The three kidnappers were handcuffed and pressed onto the police car. While [Xing Feng] was unlocking the handcuffs for [Mr. Wu], the other armed police officers inside the house carefully searched every corner of the room. The officers in the courtyard also meticulously searched the car and the warehouse. The chief watched as [Xing Feng] and [Cao Gang] came out unscathed, and said with relief.
1:37:8|1:37:39|Mr. Wu and Xiao Dou, who are still in shock, walked out of the courtyard with several armed police officers. Mr. Wu stopped in front of the car, turned around slowly to take a last look at the unforgettable courtyard before getting in. Xiao Dou, who had been tied up for two days, was helped into the car by the police. After the chief inspector closed the door of their car and signaled to leave, the rest of the vehicles followed suit. All the cars drove back with their sirens on, while inside the car, Mr. Wu and Xiao Dou...
1:37:39|1:37:47|There was no joy of surviving a disaster, instead they all sat in silence, pondering. [Cao Gang] asked softly,
1:38:8|1:38:38|After rescuing Mr. Wu and Xiao Dou, the convoy drove back to downtown Beijing in a grand manner. Mr. Su, Manager Cheng, and Xiao Dou's girlfriend were already waiting at the police station. When Mr. Wu got off the car, he tightly hugged Mr. Su. Mr. Wu, who had never cried in the face of vicious kidnappers and death, was now sobbing uncontrollably while hugging Mr. Su. Seeing his dear friend return alive, Mr. Su's heart, which had been hanging by a thread, finally relaxed, and tears streamed down his face.
1:38:38|1:38:45|After embracing Mr. Su for a long time, the recovered Mr. Wu then hugged Mr. Cheng, who was holding flowers, to the side.
1:39:0|1:39:8|After Xiao Dou's girlfriend finished speaking, she hugged Xiao Dou tightly. [Mr. Wu] saw this and tears streamed down his face as he embraced Mr. Su and Manager Cheng. And so, the two survivors embraced each other after the disaster.
1:39:8|1:39:14|The next day, [Xing Feng] sighed as he sat tightly huddled with their family members.
1:39:47|1:39:57|10 months later, the court handed down a verdict on the arrested [Zhang Hua] and others.
1:40:40|1:40:58|[Zhang Hua] nodded as he listened to his mother's words, tears streaming down his face. After hanging up the phone, [Zhang Hua] wiped away his tears, but when he saw his mother again, tears welled up in his eyes once more.
1:40:58|1:41:13|Shortly after, [Zhang Hua] stood in front of the glass wall. With tears streaming down his face, he tried hard to conceal his deep sorrow, looking at his mother who was already crying silently with a mixture of tears and smiles.
1:41:28|1:41:36|[Mr. Wu] walked up to [Zhang Hua] in a dazzling manner. He looked at [Zhang Hua], who was wearing handcuffs and ankle shackles during the prison visit, and for a moment didn't know where to begin.
1:42:10|1:42:21|After listening, [Mr. Wu] placed the prepared fruit basket in front of [Zhang Hua], and finally calmly said in front of the iron bars.
