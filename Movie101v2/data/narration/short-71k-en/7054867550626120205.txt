0:1:55|0:2:3|In the land of the Five Mountains, deep in the mountains, the bamboo forest grows lushly, with no trace of winter snow.
0:2:3|0:2:11|In the small building, there is a melodious silk and bamboo music playing, with about a dozen actors standing or sitting, all dressed in white linen costumes.
0:2:11|0:2:20|Shrouded in a mask to conceal her true identity, [Wan Hou] dances to the music of the moon, her movements as if a crystal flower blooming and then retreating, entwined with sorrow in every gesture.
0:2:20|0:2:28|Amidst the bitter cold of the Wu and Yue regions, the desolation and chilliness, one can only feel the hidden worries and unspoken thoughts of the people here, hence the melancholy and sorrow.
0:2:30|0:2:39|Several light cavalrymen in cloaks were galloping through the mountains and heading towards the bamboo building at the same time.
0:3:21|0:3:35|In the small building, [Li Di] and the other Ling people were still unaware. The words and songs danced on the bamboo couch, sometimes pulling the sleeves in front of the body, sometimes showing a pitiful look, sometimes showing resentment without complaint and short-sightedness, completely unaware that someone would visit the bamboo forest.
0:3:35|0:3:42|Accompanied by eunuchs and guards, the four arrived with the imperial decree from Empress Wan Hou after a long journey through mountains, forests, rivers, and lakes.
0:3:42|0:3:52|The performer then covered his true face with a mask, the eunuch not knowing where [Li Di] was, followed by a group of people pushing the door and entering, walking to the spacious central area inside the building.
0:3:52|0:3:57|Wan Hou then took the imperial edict in front of her and read it out loud.
0:4:16|0:4:31|Behind the mask, there is Wan Hou, listening to the murmuring of the flowing water, looking up at the sky and sighing about the customs of the late emperor. Although Li Di is friendly with his friends, the relationship between ruler and subject is inseparable, and the bond between father and son is truly hard to sever.
0:4:31|0:4:40|The words spoken by the eunuch in this text, [Li Di] is already in tears, rushing to the old city, his soul wandering in his hometown, overflowing with emotions of returning home.
0:4:40|0:4:49|[Li Di] is called [Wu Luan], with "luan" referring to the auspicious bird that brings peace to the world. The name [Wu Luan] is a metaphor, symbolizing the ongoing chaos and endless conflicts during this time.
0:4:49|0:4:54|The scene shifts to a scroll, set on the shore, showing the procession of [Yin Taichang] setting out.
0:4:54|0:4:58|The emperor sat under the magnificent canopy, exuding an imposing presence.
0:4:58|0:5:7|Among the countless palace maids in the entourage, who have experienced unparalleled lives, a poisonous scorpion is seen leaping onto the paper, stopping at the place where [Yin Taichang] is located, touching the venom and corroding the painting.
0:5:8|0:5:15|After a moment, only the Empress was left under the umbrella, indicating that there was a hidden agenda behind [Yin Taichang]'s pomp and circumstance.
0:5:15|0:5:21|The scene shifts to the capital city, where within the imperial palace, the candlelight exudes a sense of power, and everywhere one looks is shrouded in darkness.
0:5:22|0:5:39|In the grand hall, a woman in exquisite attire walks slowly. Observing her back, one can only feel that her cloud-like hair, graceful figure, and fluttering movements are like orchids and jade trees, ethereal and divine. She moves with the grace of a celestial being, her clothing fluttering like snow in a moonlit night, embodying a sense of ethereal beauty and elegance.
0:5:39|0:6:4|The woman walked to the end of the main hall and saw a pair of feather guards standing here, dressed in seven Kai with animal head masks, holding the original fire torch in one hand to observe the Tang clan, and boiling a black iron spear in the other hand to guard the electric gate. The solemn killing intent permeated the palace, making all who saw it feel awe. Behind the gate, there was a bronze giant gate, decorated luxuriously with golden animal head door handles.
0:6:4|0:6:13|Engraving the grass and trees, the fish and insects meticulously carved intricate patterns, without any gaps, as if there was light but the bottom was not visible, and it was unknown where this place was.
0:6:13|0:6:20|The woman stood in front of the spirit tablet of [Wan Hou], calm and composed, showing no signs of panic.
0:6:20|0:6:24|This time, her behavior has already established her esteemed status as a renowned woman.
0:6:24|0:6:35|After she stood still, she saw that the guards showed no intention of giving way. She neither got angry nor anxious, but maintained a dignified posture, calmly looking at the crowd, and then made no further movements.
0:6:35|0:6:40|Seeing the woman standing still in front of her own past, silent and unmoving like a mountain.
0:6:40|0:6:48|After a moment of hesitation, the guards of the Imperial Feather Guards heard the clang of the high-ranking soldiers' curse, and then split into two, left and right.
0:6:48|0:6:56|Quietly give up the passage for one person to pass through and observe the changes. The woman showed no fear, stepping into the Imperial Guards.
0:6:56|0:7:9|In groups, moving gracefully, despite the narrow path, the women walked leisurely, ignoring the nearby weapons and torches, remaining calm and composed in the midst of the solemn atmosphere, slowly advancing towards the gate.
0:7:9|0:7:16|As the time approached, several eunuchs and officials bowed and pulled open the same door, revealing the scene inside.
0:7:16|0:7:20|Every corner of the store is filled with lodgers.
0:7:20|0:7:42|Wan Hou realized that this was the late emperor, who had countless people placed on the platform, swaying with the Tang dynasty style. He then saw a figure in golden armor among them. As a woman approached, following the gaze of the person in the golden armor, Wan Hou finally saw the true face of the woman. She appeared like the moon hidden in the blue clouds, drifting like the falling snow in a graceful manner.
0:7:42|0:7:48|Thus it was that the woman stood before him for a long time, gazing at him, before finally speaking with a hint of hostility,
0:8:6|0:8:11|Upon hearing the woman's words, the new emperor took off his helmet, carefully examined the mask in front of him, and then bent down to sniff it with his nose. This was an item belonging to the former emperor.
0:8:12|0:8:20|The woman, seeing her frivolous behavior, showed displeasure, but then saw the new emperor slowly straighten up and say in a low voice
0:8:22|0:8:56|Wan Hou carefully placed the helmet back on the wooden frame, then turned and walked towards the door of the shop. As he approached the woman, the new emperor whispered by her sickbed, then continued walking towards the palace. The woman began to feel a bit flustered, her earrings swaying gently with her trembling body. The new emperor took a step forward and walked out of the palace, noticing that there was no movement from the person behind him. He then spoke to Yin Taichang, the eunuch, just now.
0:8:56|0:9:5|As the words were spoken, the bronze gates gradually closed, revealing a clear palace. The sound of the cold door axis breaking echoed in the air, lasting for a long time.
0:9:5|0:9:33|Tang Feng arrived in time, holding a torch aloft, the balance of yin and yang shifting like the unsettled emotions of a woman in the palace. Just as the fellow martial artists were about to attack, the new emperor turned around, raising his hand to halt them magically. The sound of the rotating mechanism abruptly ceased as the former emperor reached into the control panel and delicately adjusted it. A slender jade head slowly emerged from the palm of the starry ground, and finally the woman spoke.
0:9:35|0:9:39|The two held hands and listened to what the woman had just said, knowing the situation in this room.
0:9:39|0:9:45|According to the customs of the late emperor, the new emperor ascended the throne and predicted to crown the wife of his elder brother as the empress.
0:9:45|0:9:49|If not, Empress Wan Hou will have to follow the late Emperor.
0:9:49|0:9:54|The woman pondered repeatedly and finally decided to protect herself by ending things with her younger uncle.
0:9:54|0:10:18|At the same time, Emperor Qing sent the Yulin Guards to secretly rush to the Moon Bamboo Tower. They saw a group of people breaking through the obstacles, with beast heads and eyes like geese, stepping through the western flow and eastern grass, relentlessly searching for [Wan Hou] as ordered, tracing the whereabouts of the eunuchs, and pushing towards where the Crown Prince was located under the cover of night. [Wan Hou] sat alone in the palace, holding the memorial tablet in front of her eyes, mourning the late Emperor.
0:10:18|0:10:25|Wan Hou had the silk abruptly taken from her hands by the new emperor, who callously threw it aside onto the burning candle.
0:10:25|0:10:33|The smell of burning and the flames attracted a group of palace maids and eunuchs, who hurried forward to extinguish the fire. The new emperor, unimpressed, stood behind [Wan Hou].
0:10:33|0:10:41|The scorching hand spreads to the countryside and climbs up the green hills, feeling the fragrance of its flowers, but hears [Wan Hou] saying
0:10:42|0:10:51|Hearing [Wan Hou] say so, the new emperor lifted his chin and spoke coldly.
0:10:56|0:11:6|The new emperor took out a small bottle from the Linlang Red Powder Pendant and handed it to [Wan Hou], then said,
0:11:14|0:11:26|The new emperor remained silent, only his subordinate and [Wan Hou] intertwined to push away the gentle killing, soothing and calming down, squeezing towards the slender and plump body, and biting in her ear, writing only
0:11:33|0:11:56|[Wan Hou] protected her chest, stopped the new emperor's actions, and asked solemnly. The new emperor did not answer. After a moment of contemplation, he brought his lips close to [Wan Hou]'s delicate hair, and then asked softly. [Wan Hou] understood his intentions upon hearing this, and allowed the new emperor's hand to roam freely among the powder and rouge, as a kind of mist rose at some unknown time, lingering above the delicate flowers.
0:11:57|0:12:9|On the other side of the Wuyue Bamboo Forest, [Wan Hou] leaned to the left with her guards unsteady. In the distance, the sound of bamboo leaves falling could be heard, but she looked up and saw nothing, continuing to guard the small building where the Crown Prince was located.
0:12:9|0:12:14|Little did they know that this disturbance was caused by the encounter between [Wan Hou] and [Wu Luan] in the bamboo forest.
0:12:14|0:12:46|The new emperor, hidden in the rainforest, shot arrows from a hundred meters away, instantly killing the guards outside the building. The group moved forward in unison towards the bamboo building, but suddenly two figures flew out of the river, their splashes like dragons, intimidating the [Feather Guards] and others. The two, undaunted by the outnumbered situation, wielded their long swords, attacking instead of defending, demonstrating the art of close combat.
0:12:46|0:13:14|Between the flash of lightning and the flint, several [Feathered Guards] were injured and retreated. In the close combat, although the two of them were able to hold off the [Feathered Guards], they were also seriously wounded, blood flowing profusely, seeping into the ground beneath their feet. The bamboo bridge was dyed red by the river water, a trickle of red flowing. Despite their struggle for breath, they still stood on the bridge with their swords, blocking the way. At the beginning of the fierce battle against the enemy, the [Feathered Guards] suffered a hidden loss.
0:13:14|0:13:43|As the imperial guards were all seasoned warriors, [Wan Hou] quickly regained her composure and devised a plan. She saw the guards with long knives from the Feather Forest Retreat step back, while those with spears from the [Mao Shou] faction advanced. With just one clash, the two guards felt the pressure increase significantly, struggling to defend themselves. The Feather Forest Retreat's tactics demonstrated their mastery of military strategy. Indeed, moments later, a spear from the Mao Shou faction pierced through the mountain.
0:13:43|0:14:7|Two guards were powerless to resist and were killed on the bridge. Just as Wan Hou was about to achieve her goal, it was then that a figure descended from the dense bamboo leaves, wielding a broadsword, and struck the back of the Imperial Guards unexpectedly. This sudden move caused chaos among the Imperial Guards, who fell to the ground in disarray, blood splattering on the bamboo bridge.
0:14:7|0:14:26|After reorganizing their formation, both sides continued to fight. At the same time, the one who had just withdrawn from the battle, the one with the long knife, had already sneaked into the bamboo building. Inside, the masked performer had no weapons, yet still danced and sang as if fearless of life and death, seemingly oblivious to everything around, allowing [Imperial Guards] to kill without resistance.
0:14:26|0:14:45|Outside the building, the guards of the Gate of the Louvre were overwhelmed by the crowd and defeated. [Imperial Guards] led by Binghe launched a massacre in the bamboo building, splashing blood three feet high from time to time. Amidst the enchanting music and elegant dance, a masked performer danced between the floors of the building, causing the [Imperial Guards] to rush around the building and kill.
0:14:45|0:15:9|In the center of the bamboo building hangs a white robe, with several words in the language of the Yue Kingdom, which was personally read by the Crown Prince [Wu Luan]. Now stained with blood, it looks like a winter plum with a hole, shocking to the eye. However, the killings continue, with countless deaths and injuries, bodies scattered throughout the bamboo building. The wounds, whether from slashing, hacking, or stabbing, are all fatal with blood and flesh blurred, a sight too gruesome to bear.
0:15:10|0:15:38|At this moment, a masked performer stood out among the others, breaking free from the [Imperial Guards] surrounding him. He leaped to the top of a small building and looked down at the crowd, speaking loudly with a deep voice that seemed to resonate throughout the world. As the sound reached everyone's ears, it was evident that this person possessed profound skills. Inside the building, [Zhong Yuling] raised her head upon hearing the voice and saw the performer, who stood tall at eight feet, resembling a solitary pine tree in the blazing sun.
0:15:38|0:15:58|Although his true face was covered by a mask, there was still a world-covering illusion of extraordinary beauty and grace. With such unparalleled demeanor, the [Imperial Guards] present immediately felt that this person was none other than the current crown prince [Wu Luan]. Therefore, in a hurry to show off his skills, he swiftly flew to the top of the small building, only to see that the eight-foot-tall show-off, despite being unarmed, was not at all inferior.
0:16:1|0:16:7|Several people holding weapons could not approach her, confirming that she was indeed the crown prince without a doubt by the [Imperial Guards].
0:16:9|0:16:13|The guards in the field were about to kill the entertainer.
0:16:13|0:16:36|Little did they know, the Crown Prince not only had profound martial arts skills, but also unparalleled body awareness. Twisting and turning between the floors, without a weapon in hand, he defeated each of the scattered Feather Forest Guards. The Guards did not dare to delay, leveraging their numerical advantage to force the Crown Prince to the central platform of the bamboo building, where they all attacked him together. The Crown Prince remained fearless, snatching a long knife and engaging in a tangled exchange of moves with the others.
0:16:37|0:16:50|Seizing the opportunity to wield his weapons, [Wan Hou] forced [Li Di] back with awe, then leaped into the air, using all his strength to carry his sword as if it were a blade, thrusting out suddenly, directly breaking through the armor of the Feather Forest Guards, piercing through them like a mountain.
0:16:50|0:16:57|The one who received this blow was Wan Hou, and at that moment, all the onlookers were terrified, but the Emperor's command was difficult to disobey.
0:16:57|0:17:0|The guards of the Imperial Feather Army had no choice but to fight the Crown Prince to the death.
0:17:0|0:17:13|At the moment when everyone was deadlocked, a figure was seen hidden in the blind spot of the prince's vision, back facing down, a knife splitting on his back, blood staining the white clothes immediately, the wound so deep that bones and flesh were visible.
0:17:13|0:17:22|The Crown Prince, in pain but not daring to be careless, turned with his sword and struck down the Feather Forest Guard, taking advantage of the moment when the surrounding guards were distracted, he leaped to the top of the bamboo building to avoid the battle.
0:17:22|0:17:41|The crowd of imperial guards approached, following the prince to the top of the bamboo tower. The prince intended to use his younger brother to capture the enemies, but suddenly the bamboo forest on both sides stood tall without any wind, giving a sense of hidden danger. As expected, the guest who kept fish in the tower showed fear towards the three people, and rushed out from the dense bamboo forest, heading straight towards the bamboo tower.
0:17:41|0:18:3|The Crown Prince immediately defended himself upon seeing the situation, but the movement of his back injury hindered his actions. It was this slight hesitation that allowed two Imperial Guards to strike their swords against the Crown Prince's blade with such great force that he could hardly move. As another Imperial Guard swung his sword from behind, the Crown Prince, unable to resist, could only close his eyes slowly and await the blade.
0:18:3|0:18:7|The long sword swept past in an instant, leaving [Li Di] decapitated.
0:18:7|0:18:26|The powerful swordsmanship of the Imperial Guards caused the prince's head to fly into the air, spinning countless times before finally landing in the river outside the building, blood seeping out in waves. In the clear river water, [Yin Taichang] hid himself and watched with respect. It turned out to be the talented person who had just entertained the prince, merely buying time for the prince to escape.
0:18:26|0:18:36|At the same time, a woman in a hurry was seen fleeing in the imperial city corridor. She was dressed in luxurious clothing, with a weaving and dyeing workshop in the middle of the road, and she spoke,
0:18:43|0:18:58|Empress Wan pointed out, the weaver stood by her side, hanging the chosen fabric on the wooden frame. The Empress looked up and then dropped the fabric in her hand, speaking to [Qing Nv].
0:20:4|0:20:31|[Li Di] and [Wu Luan] were childhood sweethearts, destined to be together for life. However, due to the late emperor taking her as his concubine and later as empress, their love was never able to come to fruition. Meanwhile, [Qing Nv] harbored a fleeting affection for the crown prince. When these two women meet again, there is a palpable sense of animosity. [Qing Nv] reveals the true feelings between the crown prince and [Wan Hou], while [Wan Hou] admires [Qing Nv]. The dream of marrying the crown prince and reuniting in the palace seems within reach, but the empress and the new emperor's illicit affair shatters the delicate balance, leaving the empress's graceful body lying on the bed.
0:20:31|0:20:50|Firm as if disappearing into a demon like restraint, meticulous embroidery good to be made, revealing softness and grace, ambiguous in speech, the new emperor sees his family like this, with a playful mood, takes a jade dragon and places it in the cabin to soak, waiting for the beauty to be nurtured, then places it on top of the family one after another, lightly pushing and gently wiping with a sense of strength and weakness.
0:20:50|0:20:56|The Empress Wan Hou spoke lazily, her voice slow and deliberate. She was inside a light gauze canopy.
0:20:58|0:21:6|The new imperial palace is as quiet as snow, Wan Hou said.
0:21:50|0:22:8|After a pause, the new emperor Li Di whispered in Wan Hou's ear, praising her beautiful jade arms. He then continued with a smile, describing her as more enchanting than the colorful clouds at sunset.
0:22:53|0:23:19|The new emperor then placed the plum jade dragon on the empress's chin. After this blow, the empress's body softened, turning into a mixture of milk and jade liquid, entwining and stepping onto the other side. The prince [Wu Luan] luckily survived and had already sneaked into the imperial city. He chatted with the late emperor's golden armor, warning of the union of yin and yang and the closure of the empress to the palace bath. But he found that the interior decoration here was very different from the imperial palace, where the emperor resided in darkness.
0:23:19|0:23:37|Here the candles are lit as bright as daylight, with blue stone piles, surrounding walls, white jade carvings on pillars, and a bath placed in the grand hall. Warm spring water is poured in, flower crowns are scattered, and the queen, under the reflection of candlelight, removes her garments and enters the pool, bathing in the clear spring water to wash away fatigue.
0:23:37|0:23:54|In the late night, the Crown Prince summoned [Qing Nv] to the sleeping hall to discuss his inner confusion. In the quiet corner of the hall, [Qing Nv] held the candle to illuminate where the Crown Prince was. With fortune and nobility, she slowly spoke as the Crown Prince lay on the strange rock.
0:24:0|0:24:6|The Crown Prince pondered for a moment and asked slowly,
0:24:33|0:24:57|The current emperor's crown prince Ting's breath was somewhat uncontrollable, and the family members who were once childhood sweethearts first became married women, becoming their own empress dowager. Now, the late emperor has just passed away for a few days, still in the national mourning period. The uncle wants to marry his brother's wife, and appoint her as the current empress. The beloved one is treated like this, and the crown prince's heart is filled with mixed feelings. As the scene shifts,...
0:24:57|0:25:4|The scene shifts to the imperial palace, after finishing grooming, [Wan Hou] changes into a light veil under the service of the palace maids and walks towards the bedroom upstairs.
0:25:5|0:25:14|In this place, [Wan Hou] has already changed the candles, lit the incense burner, and quietly waited for the empress to arrive, entering the bedroom and sitting on the cushion.
0:25:14|0:25:35|The empress, with her elbows on the candle holder, her eyes bright and stingy, heard a strange noise behind her and quickly called out, "[Wan Hou]" ran towards [Wu Luan], but was stopped in her tracks by the prince's call, stunned for a moment.
0:25:52|0:26:1|Wan Hou, after listening, took a few steps back in restraint and asked softly:
0:26:21|0:26:56|With a burning gaze fixed on [Wan Hou], [Li Di] unexpectedly knelt down and stared at [Wan Hou], solemnly saying: "Listening to [Wu Luan]'s earnest plea." [Wan Hou]'s eyes misted over as she slowly looked at the wealthy man in front of her. As their eyes met, [Wu Luan] asked: "The sorrow and joy exchanged through their eyes became unbearable for [Wan Hou]." She embraced [Wu Luan] with a pair of jade bi discs, and a glint of conspiracy flashed in her eyes.
0:26:58|0:27:2|[Wu Luan] softly called out to [Wan Hou], resting her chin on [Wu Luan]'s forehead, and continued speaking,
0:27:33|0:27:39|In the depths of emotion, [Wan Hou] became more elusive, with lowered eyes, just as she was about to kiss the fair-skinned beauty [Wu Luan], she was suddenly pushed away.
0:27:49|0:27:54|Seeing [Wu Luan] so indifferent, [Wan Hou] took advantage of her own chaotic breathing to create some distance between them.
0:27:54|0:28:22|At this moment, as the new emperor's procession was about to report to the queen's daughter in the palace, he waved his hand to stop them. Wan Hou walked to Wu Luan's side, slapped his shoulder, and her beautiful eyes showed a mix of complexity, sometimes revealing bitterness, sometimes cunning, and finally laughed foolishly and said:
0:28:26|0:28:29|[Wu Luan] did not know what [Wan Hou] intended, but she went along with it.
0:28:29|0:28:40|Rising to her feet, [Wan Hou] took the bamboo tube off her back, holding it in front of her with both hands. She then pushed open the quiver, took out the plain scroll inside, and smiled as she glanced at [Wu Luan].
0:28:40|0:29:2|Wan Hou's hands swiftly moved the scroll like the wind, then suddenly stopped. She lifted her foot and kicked, revealing a slender figure under the blue silk, with embroidered legs swiftly kicking out a short sword from the scroll. She then danced in the air to avoid the bamboo tube held by Wu Luan, who was handing over the Yue Nu sword. Wan Hou spoke, comparing the short sword of the Yue Nu sword to the one in front of her, her face turning cold.
0:29:2|0:29:19|Continuing with the drunken close combat, he then recommended [Wu Luan] to come forward. [Wu Luan] countered [Wan Hou]'s attack with a scroll in hand, the two moved around the sleeping hall, their steps in perfect harmony, dancing under the Tang family's gaze, seemingly weakening everything around them into nothingness, creating openings.
0:29:19|0:29:21|[Wu Luan] just spoke.
0:29:24|0:29:30|Hearing what [Wu Luan] said, [Wan Hou] just nodded slightly, then calmly turned the stab into a chop towards [Wu Luan]'s tool.
0:29:30|0:29:39|The two engaged in a similar style chase inside the shop, one draped in green gauze clothing, dancing like a celestial phoenix, while the other holding gambling chips in his mouth, with a posture resembling a pine tree.
0:29:39|0:29:47|[Wan Hou] seems to use sword practice as a way to awaken the memories of [Wu Luan]'s past, but [Wan Hou] is clever and relentless in her pursuit.
0:29:47|0:29:56|On the other hand, [Wu Luan] evaded confidently, unwilling to engage, but was eventually found a flaw by [Wan Hou]. At this moment, a sword was placed at her throat, and she smiled and said.
0:30:2|0:30:8|After finishing speaking, [Wan Hou] untied the ropes of the bound scroll, and slowly it fell down, revealing the blood-stained musician's song in the Wu Yue small building.
0:30:8|0:30:17|Wu Luan spread out the remaining blessings and saw bloodstains on it, making it desolate. Then Wan Hou spoke.
0:31:31|0:31:38|Outside the sleeping hall, the new emperor heard the empress's words, clenched the scepter in his hand, and then bound his hands to his arms before suddenly leaving.
0:31:42|0:31:56|Hearing [Wu Luan] say that [Wan Hou] almost blurted out a word "him", anyone who heard it could feel the contempt and disgust in it. Even though in the imperial city, one still needs to be extremely careful. In the end, [Wan Hou] only uttered this word and said no more.
0:31:56|0:32:0|Tonight is long and full of intertwined destinies, making it difficult for several characters, including [Wan Hou], [Li Di], [Wu Luan], [Qing Nv], [Yin Taichang], and [Yin Jun], to find sleep.
0:32:0|0:32:17|The Crown Prince is well, but his relationship with his beloved is ambiguous. The new Emperor Li Di is troubled and indecisive, not returning this year. He is upset and gazes at the imperial city, feeling suddenly lost in thoughts. Day and night, he worries and calls for his mother, Wan Hou.
0:32:17|0:32:24|[Wan Hou] wept on the jade bi, tears like pearls flowing, the sword pond clear and fresh, cherishing you in my brilliance in the dream.
0:32:24|0:32:27|Qing Nv prays for Wu Luan under the moon.
0:32:27|0:32:40|As for the Feather Guards who attempted to assassinate the Crown Prince early in the morning and rushed back to the imperial city to report, out of the previous whole team, only 9 people survived, a result of the actors fighting desperately to protect the Crown Prince.
0:32:40|0:32:46|Approaching a narrow passage, Wan Hou saw an eunuch standing on the wooden bridge, his demeanor icy and blocking the way for everyone.
0:32:46|0:32:56|The leader of the Imperial Guards, followed by his subordinates, stopped the two sides on the bridge and listened to the eunuch speaking.
0:33:18|0:33:47|Even the good can set up a banquet for the Emperor Zhuque, bowing to the Emperor after thanking him, the leader drew a short knife from his waist, followed by the Linwei who imitated him one after another. For a while, the sound of weapons clashing was incessant, and the extremely spiritual power could only be seen as the Linwei soldiers pulled out their short knives and cut off the connecting ropes on their chest armor, removed the heart-protecting mirrors, and threw them into the river. When all the soldiers and horses under the command were like the leader, baring their chests,
0:33:47|0:34:8|The figure transformed into a guardian, holding a short knife in mid-air, paused for a moment before stabbing fiercely between the chest, both the kneeling man and horse did the same, using the short knife to end their lives, blood splattered in a circular pattern. Then nine people and one person sitting on a tall horse were seen, the knife entered their chests, blood gushed out from between their chests and bellies, flowing down the mane of the warhorse, seeping into the bridge surface, and dripping into the water.
0:34:8|0:34:14|Just now, after removing the military forces blocking the bridge, there were also soldiers with long spears hidden under the bridge.
0:34:14|0:34:38|The Imperial Guards committed suicide, and the eunuch ordered the troops to rush to the bridge and pour clear spring water on it. The guests who were fishing saw that the river water had turned into red blood, flowing towards the distance. Inside the imperial city, the candlelight was appreciated, so occasionally there was a glimpse of sunlight shining down from the dome. In the Tang family residence, although it was grand and imposing, it lacked some brilliance and extravagance.
0:34:38|0:34:49|In the new imperial mausoleum, Wan Hou was accompanied by civil and military officials. Looking up at the hall, she spoke after a while.
0:35:40|0:35:50|The crowd walked to the hall, where the head was removed to reveal a stone carved screen. If the emperor did not like this snowy mountain, Xuan Bao would immediately send someone to replace it.
0:36:44|0:36:58|Should this snow mountain black panther be bestowed upon Lord Taichang [Pei Hong Thunderbolt], the courtiers couldn't help but chuckle and cover their mouths in laughter when the new emperor asked this question.
0:36:58|0:37:13|Being the son of Taichang, [Yin Jun] glared at [Pei Hong] who was about to draw his sword, but was stopped by Taichang. The new emperor, seeing this, calmly said, "I will bestow this snow mountain black panther to Taichang."
0:37:26|0:37:41|The carved flying dragon soars in the sky, [Wan Hou] suddenly arrives, speaking loudly, causing the courtiers to look sideways. The new emperor turns his head to look. Seeing the empress approaching the hall, the ministers quickly bow and greet, as [Yin Taichang] speaks loudly, offering his respects to His Majesty.
0:37:48|0:38:5|The grand hall was empty, with Wan Hou standing on the platform, surrounded by ministers and court ladies. All present heard his words but dared not speak. The new emperor saw everyone in such a state, so he brought a tray of grapes from his side and slowly walked towards the throne before speaking.
0:38:17|0:38:40|After a moment of silence, someone among the courtiers hesitantly replied to the new emperor's question about what he had heard. No one dared to speak up, but the powerful minister Gongshan bowed before the empress, while [Pei Hong] remained motionless on the ground. The new emperor entered the hall and looked around at everyone in their disguises before the eunuch Fang'er finally spoke up.
0:40:1|0:40:5|These words were so powerful that they made the courtiers and the imperial guards stand up straight in their armor. After hearing this, Empress Wan Hou...
0:40:5|0:40:16|Without hesitation, Wan Hou, Wu Luan, and Qing Nv knelt down and greeted the Emperor Li Di.
0:40:18|0:40:27|[Pei Hong] laughed heartily when he saw the courtiers.
0:41:8|0:41:22|With a look of reluctance on her face, but also not daring to say more, the Imperial Guards stepped forward to capture [Pei Hong]. However, they saw [Pei Hong] commanding respect and awe around him, and he removed the headgear on his head, glaring angrily at [Wu Luan] before following the Imperial Guards away.
0:41:22|0:41:31|Taken to the ceremony by [Pei Hong], the new emperor turned around and helped the empress up, saying, as the empress looked at the screen,
0:41:36|0:41:51|The dragon soars in the sky, Wan Hou and Li Di exchange a smile, then lead the officials to the city tower to watch the arrival of Pei Hong's execution site. The four city towers surround the area, with narrow sand fields below and the Yulin Guards guarding the passages, making it difficult to access the waterside pavilion.
0:41:51|0:42:1|Ten executioners stood in the field, holding torches, with [Pei Hong] in their midst, while his nine relatives were stripped of their long robes and bound hand and foot, kneeling on the sandy ground.
0:42:1|0:42:21|But seeing the executioner swinging the cudgel forcefully, sending the seven-foot tall man Pei Hong flying in the air, the sound of the cudgel cracking the valley incessantly, the shattered soul and body did not fall to the ground, enduring the plight in mid-air, bones and flesh torn apart, abdomen swollen and shattered, fresh blood spraying from his throat, splashing on the sandy ground, dust flying, above the walls of the city in all directions.
0:42:22|0:42:33|When the civil and military officials saw the tragic situation of the guilty, they all actively felt threatened. On both sides of the road, at the edge of the sandy land, the soldiers were in a state of shock and fear when they heard Pei Hong's wailing.
0:42:33|0:42:41|[Wan Hou] sat below the Pengge, with an old man with white hair in the field seeking medical treatment, his body covered in blood and wounds, seeming unable to bear to look directly at it again.
0:42:41|0:42:49|The new emperor caught a glimpse of [Wan Hou] pondering for a moment, then glanced at Pei Hong and softly spoke,
0:43:0|0:43:8|The new emperor, with the crown swaying on his head, did not speak until the pearl curtain above him stopped moving.
0:43:10|0:43:19|But [Wan Hou] could only lower her eyes and reply softly. The new emperor was asking whether [Wan Hou] regretted her decision.
0:43:19|0:43:30|If [Wan Hou] agrees, then the previous promise made in the court to be [Wan Hou] was nothing but deceiving the emperor. Therefore, [Wan Hou] can only watch in silence as her brother accompanies her to witness the tragic scene.
0:43:30|0:43:39|Looking down again, the guard used a bamboo stick to push Pei Hong into the hidden compartment, then another person came forward swinging a club, fiercely attacking Pei's head.
0:43:39|0:43:47|Having him fall and crash to the ground, raising a cloud of dust. Struck by this blow, Pei Hong was unable to move and died a tragic death under the staff.
0:43:59|0:44:7|Does she regret it now? Hearing her brother's proud question, [Wan Hou] then whispered softly.
0:44:10|0:44:15|Seeing the calm expressions of his family, but with lips and teeth intertwined, [Li Di] smiled on his face and said,
0:44:23|0:44:31|Upon hearing what [Li Di] said, it seemed like he was eager to present a grand gift to him. One of the eunuchs spoke up,
0:44:37|0:45:0|At the time when the traitor Fu Zhu's blood had not yet dried, [Li Di] took the empress to the horse field to play a game of polo. This gathering was a way to show off his official status and engage in entertainment. People played polo on the sandy field, aiming to score by passing the ball through the goal. [Li Di] used this method to make up for his regret of not personally defeating Pei Hong in battle. The two sides galloped back and forth, raising clouds of dust in the sky.
0:45:0|0:45:11|Li Di and the Empress each led their troops, waving long poles, competing for the hollow silver ball. The steeds were as swift as thunder, the iron-clad horses raced like the wind, and the convergence of wind and thunder made the scene even more majestic.
0:45:11|0:45:25|During the interaction, [Li Di] and the Empress Wan Hou drove together, heading towards the Silver Ball Water. As they approached, the Silver Ball landed between the two of them. The Empress hurriedly tried to grab it, but was blocked by [Li Di]. Confused, the Empress turned to look at [Li Di], and then heard the base say something.
0:45:30|0:45:55|The empress was shocked by the words, [Li Di] was relentless, and after speaking, he waved the wooden stick in his hand and fiercely hit the silver ball on the ground, forcing the guards at the ball hole to fall off their horses due to the great force. Then, looking at the winning ball, it bounced back to the starry ground for practice. [Li Di] then swung the stick to knock the silver ball into the hole, and then turned his horse and left.
0:45:55|0:46:0|At the same time, [Yin Jun] glared angrily, faced with this screen, and then drew his sword to chop down.
0:46:2|0:46:15|Taichang hurriedly spoke out to stop him, asking Yin Jun who held the sword in mid-air with a trembling voice.
0:46:33|0:46:48|He knew nothing, the daughter of Taichang [Yin Jun]'s sister [Qing Nv] was engaged to the Crown Prince, who was in the middle of weaving clothes for the Queen. When he saw his father coming, he didn't get up to greet him, only saying,
0:47:14|0:47:23|Taichang saw [Qing Nv] but still didn't understand her intentions, and no longer beat around the bush, speaking directly.
0:47:44|0:48:0|[Qing Nv] inserted the sleeve needle into the fabric, looking at the silver phoenix shaking its head slowly. After a while, she said indifferently, tears shimmering in her beautiful eyes. The next day, she went to the royal palace to invite the queen to try on the royal attire.
0:48:22|0:48:45|Qing Nv and the palace maid carefully took off the phoenix robe together, then left the palace. After the two of them walked away, the empress swayed her delicate body gracefully, leaned towards the new emperor and asked. The new emperor pondered for a moment upon hearing her question, then lowered his eyes and replied to the empress.
0:48:58|0:49:20|[Wu Luan] walked to the center of the hall, gradually inspecting the weapons in the hands of the Imperial Guards, confirming their accuracy. Then, she recommended them in front of the new Emperor and Empress on the throne, and spoke out loud, "The Imperial Guards have always heard that Your Highness is a master of swordsmanship, far beyond the skills of mere youths."
0:49:31|0:49:45|Upon hearing the leader of the Yulin Guards speak, the Yulin Guards drew their swords and stood in front of [Wu Luan]. [Wu Luan] also showed his short weapon on his chest in return.
0:49:45|0:49:51|The dimly lit hall flickered with candlelight on the armor, making it feel even colder.
0:49:51|0:50:16|Guests from afar, with everyone brandishing their swords, the Imperial Guards launched a fierce attack, paying no attention to those in front of them. Among them was the current Emperor's nephew, the former Crown Prince. The situation was intense, with a clear intention to spill [Wu Luan]'s blood on the spot. The clash of blades echoed through the hall, as Wu Luan wielded her dagger skillfully, holding her own against two opponents. Even the Empress on the throne remained calm, with a faint smile on her lips, unaware of the danger.
0:50:16|0:50:35|Watching Wu Luan single-handedly knock down two Feather Guards, if not for the fact that the weapons in their hands were all made of wood, these two would have already been standing. In the current situation, the Feather Guards and others surrounded Wu Luan, attacking together. Facing more than ten Feather Guards alone, [Wu Luan] felt the pressure increase significantly, finding it difficult to defend.
0:50:35|0:50:52|[Wu Luan], sensing the unfavorable situation, switched from offense to defense. Relying on her unparalleled body technique, she moved around the hall, engaging with the Lin guards. However, facing four opponents with only two fists, [Wu Luan] was overwhelmed and had no strength to fight back. She could only rely on instinct to wield her short sword to block the unknown attacks from the heavy feathered armor.
0:50:52|0:51:3|Standing at this moment, [Wu Luan] has exhausted all her strength, and most likely, her breath is tearing at her lungs, causing excruciating pain. If this continues, she will surely be defeated and may even perish.
0:51:3|0:51:11|During a moment of confusion for Wu Luan, numerous imperial guards swiftly drew their long swords and passed them under his armpits, lifting Wu Luan into the air where he was unable to move.
0:51:12|0:51:17|Another Imperial Guard struck [Wu Luan] in the chest with the hilt of his sword, sending her flying off the main hall.
0:51:17|0:51:25|Wan Hou's expression changed instantly. The calmness and smile from before disappeared, replaced by deep concern and worry.
0:51:25|0:51:50|Watching [Wu Luan] in the scene again, her steps are not floating, showing no signs of weakness. She launches a strong attack without anger, displaying a strong will to survive. Her body barely withstands the attacks of the heavy Feather Guards. The Feather Guards, unable to break through for a long time, appear somewhat impatient. Their coordination is not tight, inadvertently giving [Wu Luan] an opportunity to exploit. In a fierce battle, she once again repels several Feather Guards. Seeing how difficult [Wu Luan] is to deal with, someone among the Feather Guards seeks a gap to challenge her.
0:51:50|0:52:5|Behind a stone pillar in the hall, [Wan Hou] retrieved wooden weapons hidden there beforehand and replaced them with steel ones from the armory, waiting for the right moment to enter the battlefield. Stepping on the backs of his comrades, he leaped into the air, wielding his long sword with force as he struck towards [Wu Luan].
0:52:5|0:52:16|[Wu Luan] saw the fierce momentum approaching, quickly moved a few steps back, raised a defense in front of the forehead, but as the short weapons clashed, the sound of impact lightly carved into his hand, causing the arrow in his hand to break.
0:52:16|0:52:29|Seeing such ignorance, it was clear that today's swordsmanship practice was fake. Uncle's killing seemed real, so he glared at the big shots in the palace only to see the new brother, named as a fake sister, as if everything in the field had not entered his eyes.
0:52:29|0:52:37|In a moment of distraction, [Wu Luan] was once again knocked down by a group of Imperial Guards, the broken sword in her hand was knocked away, leaving her defenseless and unable to fight back.
0:52:37|0:52:46|Once again, the Feather Scale Guard wielding a long sword swoops down from the sky, intending to put [Wu Luan] in a life-threatening situation. At this critical moment, [Wan Hou] rises from her seat.
0:52:46|0:53:4|Floating in mid-air, the broken sword was caught by [Li Di]. The prince knocked the long sword out of the hands of the Imperial Guards, and [Wu Luan] lay on the ground unharmed. [Wan Hou] turned around and looked around at the cold-faced Imperial Guards, saying, "0:53:5-0:53:12, the Imperial Guards hurriedly bowed and said, 'Your Majesty.' The Empress raised her eyes and saw the new Emperor entering the hall.
0:53:13|0:53:19|Approaching [Wan Hou], she softly spoke.
0:53:42|0:53:59|When the Empress saw [Wu Luan] walking away, she suddenly drew her sword and turned around, thrusting the sword into the throat of the Yulin Guard who had dropped the noble attire on the ground. The sudden killing, whether out of anger for disrupting the swordplay performance or for failing to kill [Wu Luan], was unclear.
0:54:0|0:54:9|On the other side, the queen went to the crown prince's bedroom to comb his long hair.
0:54:17|0:54:25|Feeling the delicate jade fingers of [Wan Hou], [Wu Luan] softly replied.
0:54:52|0:55:8|Dipping his hands into the pool to wash away the guilt, then gently touching [Wu Luan]'s neck, [Wan Hou] turned her body, leaned in and asked, [Wu Luan] looked up at [Wan Hou] and replied.
0:56:6|0:56:18|After [Wan Hou] finished speaking, she threw the plain mask in front of [Wu Luan], then dragged her skirt and left the prince's bedroom in a huff, returning to silence. The moonlight washed over, enveloping Wu Luan in the courtyard, adding to the loneliness.
0:56:18|0:56:23|He covered the mask on his face, seemingly unwilling to admit what Wan Hou had just said.
0:56:23|0:56:50|At this moment, a piece of silk floated down from the sky, [Wu Luan] reached out and grabbed it. Upon closer inspection, it was found to have patterns on it. Slowly unfolding it, two figurines were revealed on the plain silk. One of them was majestic, dressed in royal attire with dragon patterns symbolizing an emperor, but with blood on the back of the head. Looking at the side, the other figure had a skeletal and outstanding appearance, resembling a skilled assassin.
0:56:51|0:57:6|[Wu Luan] watched as the hand holding the scroll trembled uncontrollably, the long night slowly passed, and the next day in the early capital market, whether it was the imperial court or a foreign country, all clans traded here.
0:57:6|0:57:22|In the midst of chaos, a figure in white robes shuttles through the crowd, walking across a hidden barrier to avoid detection, heading towards a dark and secluded building under the city wall. Upon entering, a person is seen sitting on the wooden platform of the second floor. Seeing someone approaching, the person speaks.
0:57:33|0:57:39|[Wu Luan] caught it and examined it carefully in front of her eyes, about to sniff it with her nose, but then she heard the person say
0:58:27|0:58:42|Continuing to mutter incessantly even after returning to the sleeping palace.
0:58:48|0:59:5|I heard the Empress Dowager say that, [Wu Luan] upon hearing this, looked towards [Qing Nv] with a hint of reproach, causing [Qing Nv] to panic and quickly lower her eyes, not daring to meet the gaze of her beloved. The palace was not lit by candles, only the moonlight washed over, making the silent moment even colder.
0:59:5|0:59:26|Qing Nv took the scroll inscribed with the Yue people's song from Wu Luan's hand and pushed it open, softly reciting.
1:0:20|1:0:41|Wu Luan, with the palace empty, was pulling at the clothes of Wan Hou. Wu Lanfeng was also chasing after Qing Nv, pulling down the already thin clothes on her delicate body, revealing her beauty to Wu Luan in the mortal world. His eyes were filled with confusion as he gazed at her, his fiery eyes, forcibly embracing Qing Nv, feeling the teasing sensation of their skins brushing against each other.
1:0:43|1:1:0|Qing Nv's timid and helpless cries, along with the dripping wet Feifei prostitute through the skylight, holding a person as warm as jade, Wu Luan's unbearable decoration, took Qing Nv away on the cold floor, never expecting to lose something in this way.
1:1:0|1:1:6|The dense rain flowed down the eaves, turning into a water curtain that quietly concealed the bustling crowd inside the shop.
1:1:6|1:1:17|Under the skywell, the Golden Woman cradled the naked [Wu Luan], as if a mother caressing a playful child, water droplets lingering on them, outlining the softness and firmness just now.
1:1:26|1:1:33|One morning, the rare light of the day shone, with continuous mountains in the outskirts of the city, stretching for thousands of miles, while inside the city, clouds and mist intertwined, making it difficult to distinguish between yin and yang.
1:1:33|1:1:44|The imperial city towers high, connecting with the sky, dominating the clouds and mist, with rivers and lakes arranged outside the palace walls, lush and more abundant than the forests in the mountains and fields, with countless ministers and officials making their voices heard.
1:1:44|1:2:14|The resounding voice of the Sui Dynasty's interior decoration spread, and the grand ceremony of [Wan Hou]'s enthronement was just beginning. In the middle of the imperial city's corridor, black-armored imperial guards split left and right, escorting the empress without incident. Ahead, there were those who skillfully wielded the reins of spirited horses, leading the way with astonishment. Following the sound of the Five Sacred Mountains, they slowly proceeded towards the court where the new emperor was located. Behind them, there were others holding golden ceremonial instruments, smoothly moving forward with six high-headed horses adorned in golden armor, led by dedicated handlers.
1:2:14|1:2:22|Driving the carriage of [Wan Hou] slowly forward, the carriage was seen to be more than ten feet long, entirely made of purple sandalwood.
1:2:22|1:2:29|Under the seat, there is a pure gold cloud pattern that clashes with each other, providing enough space for [Wan Hou] and other commoners to sit in the carriage.
1:2:29|1:2:39|Looking at the top of the crown made of pure gold, even when the sunlight is rare, it shines brightly and luxuriously, with silk curtains hanging down, extremely extravagant.
1:2:40|1:2:50|[Wan Hou] is now dressed in a phoenix robe made of crimson silk, sitting in the middle of the imperial carriage, passing through the corridor and placed in the main hall. All civil and military officials and ceremonial guards are following.
1:2:50|1:3:23|As for the Feathered Forest Guards, the palace eunuchs, and the princesses, they all split up and lined the sides of the road to welcome [Wan Hou]. She was adorned in the brilliance of Royalty, with swaying arm movements and a dazzling headdress of gold and jade, adorned with pearls. It was evident that her makeup for today's enthronement was different, more splendid than ever before. As she approached the new emperor, a palace eunuch presented a rare treasure to [Wan Hou], which the new emperor personally opened to reveal a jade seal engraved with the characters "Joy of Wan Hou".
1:3:24|1:3:34|[Wan Hou] smiled and summoned the palace maids to collect the imperial seal. Then, hand in hand with the new emperor, she graciously greeted the courtiers.
1:3:48|1:4:18|The Imperial Guards, a strategy of the new emperor, were summoned by the internal supervisor. They appeared in the rainforest robes, clanking their armor as they walked to the main hall. In the center, the new emperor and [Wan Hou] bowed in front of the hall, then split the arena to make way for the crown prince. After a while, [Wu Luan] was nowhere to be seen, causing the eunuch to anxiously look towards [Wu Luan], whose gaze was extremely cold. Just then, the crown prince appeared wearing a mask, holding a stool in front of him.
1:4:18|1:4:39|Walking slowly to the stage, bowing respectfully, a black-clothed masked figure leaped out from behind, crouching in front of the prince, speaking for [Wu Luan]. With hands clasped to the chest, he spoke to the officials in the field.
1:4:41|1:4:47|Wan Hou then somersaulted several times in the air and said to the Feather Guards on both sides of the arena.
1:4:49|1:5:5|After pushing all the Feather Guards off the stage, leaving only himself and [Wu Luan], he lit the candles around [Wu Luan], led the people away from her, and with a drumstick pointed at the person in black robe, the performance began.
1:5:12|1:5:37|The sound of drums is heard, a sword is raised, and a handsome man enters the stage with a drunken demeanor, dancing upon seeing this. Then a person in black is seen standing on his head on the stage, pretending to be a palace wall, [the handsome man] leans against the person in black and dances along with the drumbeat, spinning around. The scene is so vivid that it's hard to distinguish between reality and illusion, then he lies down next to the person in black and falls into a deep sleep.
1:5:37|1:5:47|At this moment, the man in white gently lifted the hem of his pants and walked slowly on the stage, looking around with his companions, whispering towards [Huafu Man] who was in the torture device.
1:5:47|1:5:55|[Wu Luan] sat in the hall, looking pensive, as she watched a man in white slowly advancing to the beat of the drum.
1:5:55|1:6:1|Huddled near [Wan Hou] on the carpet, feeling around, thus interacting with [Wan Hou]'s ankle.
1:6:1|1:6:22|Both of them trembled, [Hua Fu] stood up in surprise, while the man in white acted like a startled bird. The empress's eyes were cold and stern, showing her relationship with the court. Knowing what [Wu Luan] meant, she remained silent and observed quietly. Despite the disturbance between the two, they did not notice each other's presence due to the dim moonlight.
1:6:22|1:6:29|The two were only separated by a small distance, yet they never truly understood each other. [Wan Hou] probed for a while, but felt indifferent in the end.
1:6:29|1:6:39|The man in white robe, feeling indignant, brushed his sleeve. The man in white robe hurriedly avoided the sleeve and fell to the ground in embarrassment. When he got up, he noticed that [Wan Hou] was already sitting on the ground.
1:6:39|1:7:4|The empress in the palace saw this, as if all memories were difficult to calm, her heart seemed to want to protect the immortal placed on the phoenix robe, sometimes tightly grasping, sometimes trembling, completely immersed in it. Suddenly hearing the drumming, she saw a man in white clothes flipping around on the stage and circling behind [Huafu Man], slowly reaching out his right hand, as if about to strike at the neck of [Huafu Man], but then hesitated as if having some concerns.
1:7:4|1:7:15|Avoiding the body, Wan Hou took out a screen and a goose feather from her arms. The new emperor in the palace was indifferent, without any brilliance. Then a cold smile appeared, even the pearl curtain on top was trembling slightly.
1:7:15|1:7:29|In the scene, Wan Hou saw a man in white using a feather to open the bottle, then pouring white powder from the bottle onto the feather. The new emperor, Li Di, saw how skilled he was, resembling his father. He lightly tapped his fingers to the sound of the music, with a look of indifference.
1:7:30|1:7:41|Shortly after, the drumbeats grew darker, and a man in white placed a goose feather near the ear of a man in a luxurious robe, then gently blew powder, causing it to drift slowly into the ear of the man in the luxurious robe.
1:7:41|1:8:5|At this moment, the new emperor saw a pair of golden fake weights in front of him, which was an old item of the late emperor. The iron-faced eyes seemed to still have traces of blood at the corners. When the new emperor came to his senses, he saw a man lying on the ground in the field, motionless. Seeing this, the new emperor found it difficult to calmly look at the extremely stern face of the man in the field.
1:8:5|1:8:29|It seems that the play touches on the deep secrets of her heart. Thinking of this, the late emperor's face was covered in iron, with blood flowing from the corner of his eye endlessly. The new emperor's strategy, Wan Hou saw the play and was once again plunged into memories. The scene of the late emperor's death was vivid in her mind, just like the play before her eyes. As a result, her expression collapsed, her delicate frame trembling uncontrollably.
1:8:29|1:8:55|Adorned with a golden hairpin and dangling earrings swaying with her every breath, the court officials and military officers all appeared pensive, yet no one dared to speak. The court fell into silence, and after the audience, the new emperor finally regained composure, pretending to be calm as he observed [Li Di] performing. He then put on a smile, stood up, and walked towards the imperial seat, with [Li Di] accompanying the emperor.
1:8:55|1:9:22|The two walked slowly in the hall and entered the stage. The new emperor in gorgeous attire raised his hands slowly, clapped lightly, and then turned to the civil and military officials below the stage, applauding. The officials followed suit, and the applause thundered in the hall, dispelling the previous coldness. However, Taichang had other plans in mind, remaining indifferent and watching coldly.
1:9:22|1:9:27|During this interval, the actors on stage rose and took their leave, disappearing into the shop without a trace.
1:9:27|1:9:42|[Wu Luan] saw the situation and got up from the table, but the actor's mask still remained on his face, never taken off. After the officials applauded, the new emperor walked to [Wu Luan] with a measured pace and spoke.
1:9:50|1:10:4|Upon hearing the words of the new emperor, the crown prince [Wu Luan] took off his mask, revealing his eyes devoid of spirit, tears and sweat, as if completely immersed in the play and unable to extricate himself. Seeing this, the new emperor took a step forward and spoke.
1:11:15|1:11:23|Yin Taichang slowly retreated back into the ranks of courtiers, while Li Di turned to look at the empress and then faced the courtiers, saying, "..."
1:11:39|1:11:46|Hearing the resolute words of the Empress, Li Di's deputy, Wan Hou, slowly approached with a puzzled expression, staring at him coldly and questioning.
1:12:2|1:12:11|The Empress Wan Hou suddenly realized her previous loss of composure, hurriedly lowered her eyes, gathered her thoughts, and then listened to her new younger brother Chen Sheng asking
1:12:50|1:12:59|Accompanied by the Crown Prince, the new emperor casually designated [Wu Luan] as the hostage in front of the courtiers.
1:12:59|1:13:8|Sending [Wu Luan] to the harsh land of the Khitans, under the guise of shouldering a great responsibility, but in reality, it is only to extinguish her thoughts of revenge, in order to protect the imperial power.
1:13:8|1:13:30|The empress, without desire, walked slowly to [Wu Luan]'s side, reaching out to smooth the wrinkles on his clothes. Tears welled up in her eyes, but she forced herself to remain calm and managed a faint, sorrowful smile as she softly said, "Wu Luan, your heart will break when we meet again."
1:13:32|1:13:50|As he was about to leave, he heard a girl in the shop blocking the way. [Wu Luan] followed the sound and saw [Qing Nv] walking towards the stage among the courtiers' gazes. When she reached the stage, [Qing Nv] respectfully bowed to the new emperor and empress, and then spoke.
1:14:5|1:14:17|Qing Nv, innocent and outspoken, did not expect the empress's anger to burn inside. With a chilling smile on the surface, she looked at Qing Nv and coldly said, "..."
1:14:30|1:14:39|Wu Luan blurted out upon hearing Empress Wan Hou's words, not hiding her complaints about Qing Nv kneeling on the ground in a disrespectful manner, and she couldn't understand why the Empress was so angry.
1:14:39|1:14:51|This chapter comes to an end, with the emperor's eloquent words. The hostage [Wu Luan] is to accompany the Imperial Guards to the Khitan, fully aware of the new emperor's intentions, but he is completely indifferent.
1:14:51|1:15:9|The city of Meng is filled with gloom and favoritism, being here only adds to the pain. It's better to leave and find peace. However, it's a pity that [Qing Nv], who has not yet married, revealed her feelings in front of the Empress and ministers, only to be punished due to the new Emperor's jealousy and the Empress's resentment.
1:15:9|1:15:32|At this moment, lying on the ground, unable to bear the pain, [Yin Taichang] looked at the bloody scar on his daughter's back, while Jiang applied medicine to his hands and said.
1:15:41|1:15:50|At this moment, a eunuch shouted loudly, making [Yin Taichang] flustered. He hurriedly went to the tomb, shedding tears of sorrow, and respectfully welcomed the queen to move to the Taichang Mansion.
1:15:52|1:16:15|Leading everyone into the palace, Wan Hou quickly walked to the Taichang Mansion, where they were forbidden to approach Qing Nv. Reaching out and brushing past the window on her back without any mercy, Qing Nv endured in silence. The Empress then spoke up and asked.
1:16:38|1:16:59|Seeing [Qing Nv] not responding to him, the Empress pressed [Qing Nv]'s face against her own, with a cold smile on her face, and asked him.
1:17:34|1:17:51|After speaking, Wan Hou smiled and turned to leave, kneeling before Taichang. A hint of pleasure flashed discreetly across the Empress's face.
1:17:52|1:18:0|The scene shifts to a vast snowy plain, where [Wu Luan] speaks up to inquire the accompanying Imperial Guards.
1:18:23|1:18:40|After finishing speaking to Lin Wei, Wan Hou continued to lead the way with the reins in hand. Just as the Crown Prince was about to feel emotional, he saw the Yulin Guard beside him behaving in such a disrespectful manner, showing no respect at all. Therefore, he looked displeased. But now with the new emperor in power, there was nothing he could do but continue on towards the Khitan border with the others.
1:18:40|1:18:44|When they arrived at the top of the snow-capped mountain, everyone took a short break.
1:18:44|1:18:59|[Wu Luan] looked around and happened to see a team dressed in a very similar way to their own, walking ahead on the snowy road. Perplexed, [Wu Luan] turned around and asked the leader of the Imperial Guards.
1:19:15|1:19:23|Prince Wen's words made the guards, including Yu and Lin, draw their long swords from their waists and throw down what they were holding. Prince raised his flag, his gaze cold as he spoke.
1:19:33|1:20:0|During the conversation of the Imperial Guards, [Wu Luan] secretly pulled out a dagger from under the horse, preparing to fight to the death. The leader seemed to have sensed something, immediately swinging his long knife towards [Wu Luan]. Just then, a sound of a throat being cut was heard from the ground, followed by splattering blood. A person leaped from the snow behind, wielding a long knife and striking at the leader of the Imperial Guards. Blood splattered on the spot, the body turned cold, while the warm sun shone in the neighborhood.
1:20:0|1:20:30|Upon this sudden change, the guards of the Imperial Feather Guards were caught off guard. Suddenly, numerous soldiers in white robes emerged from the snowy surroundings, surrounding the Feather Guards with powerful crossbows. Arrows flew, piercing through the hearts of the Feather Guards, leaving them no chance to fight back. They fell to the ground, lifeless in the snow. As the white-robed figures gathered and [Wu Luan] opened his eyes, he saw the bodies of the Feather Guards lying around him, all dressed in black robes. He too lay in the snow, stained with blood, a stark and vivid scene.
1:20:30|1:20:36|The leader in white robes spoke again.
1:20:38|1:20:50|The man in white lifted the muscles on his face, revealing himself to be the son of the current Taichang [Yin Jun], who received a secret order from his father. He led elite troops to ambush at the border between Youzhou and the Khitan, rescuing [Wu Luan] from the hands of the Imperial Guards.
1:20:50|1:21:15|The bloodstains of the lion's body cleaned by the crowd sat on the wooden raft, galloping on the snowy plain pulled by a spirited horse. [Wu Luan] and [Yin Jun] sat together, but they looked at each other in silence. [Yin Jun] remained calm and never smiled, while [Wu Luan] was full of doubts in her heart but found it difficult to ask. After hesitating for a while, she finally struggled to speak and asked.
1:21:25|1:21:31|Prince Wen [Yin Jun] listened to him for a long time, feeling guilty in his heart, and sat down on the Mu Hua to avoid his gaze.
1:21:37|1:21:51|After a brief response from [Yin Jun], he fell silent. [Wu Luan] also quieted down. The group moved on, heading deeper into the distant mountains and forests. [Yin Jun] ordered his soldiers to light a fire, burning all the unknown corpses and clothing in the rainforest.
1:21:51|1:21:57|Seeing the fire raging, [Wu Luan] spoke up again and asked,
1:23:2|1:23:15|[Yin Jun], in a fluctuating mood, after questioning fiercely, unexpectedly drew his sword and placed it at the neck of [Wu Luan], glaring angrily. Hearing [Yin Jun]'s remarks, [Wu Luan] seemed to be moved, allowing him to offend without saying a word.
1:23:15|1:23:30|The scene shifts to the imperial palace in the capital city, where [Yin Taichang] brings the chess piece and the masked performer to attack Yin Jun, the military governor of Youzhou. Both father and son are extremely nervous as they examine the blood-stained mask.
1:23:31|1:23:41|After a long silence, the new emperor finally spoke, saying, "Follow this mask."
1:23:54|1:24:0|You are probably talking to someone else.
1:25:8|1:25:14|Upon hearing the words of the eunuch, the new emperor took a deep breath, gazing into the void. After a long while, he sighed and said,
1:25:38|1:25:44|The scene shifts to the Taichang Mansion, where after the ancestral worship, [Yin Taichang] turns and walks towards [Yin Jun], saying,
1:26:24|1:26:41|Where [Qing Nv] was heading was the boudoir of [Qing Nv], with [Yin Jun] walking on it. Faintly hearing [Qing Nv] singing, he stopped in his tracks. [Qing Nv] turned around with a smile, placing the mask of the performer in front of her eyes. [Qing Nv] seemed to not believe that [Wu Luan] was already dead, and slowly said.
1:26:55|1:27:2|Seeing Wan Hou lightly brushing her hand, the mask immersed in a dream, talking to herself.
1:27:3|1:27:36|Seeing the increasingly thin figure of Wan Hou, Li Di felt heartbroken for a long time. He slowly approached her, stood behind her, embraced her in his arms, and comforted her. Upon hearing Wan Hou's resolute words, Yin Jun felt extremely distressed. With a surge of emotions, he tightened his embrace and then confided,
1:27:42|1:27:56|Upon hearing him say so in her ear, [Qing Nv] was graceful, with bright eyes and a slight chill, a sly smile on her chin. With this smile, it seemed that her rosy cheeks and the downward momentum were faintly shimmering with radiance.
1:27:56|1:28:9|Watching him tie his hands and gently press the spiritual mask against his chest, caressing the patterns on it, as if embracing [Wu Luan] after the rain, feeling the remaining tenderness.
1:28:9|1:28:23|At the same time, [Qing Nv] hesitated repeatedly as the person she was concerned about rode a white horse on the snowy plain, but eventually galloped towards the mountains. The imperial city was shrouded in mysterious clouds, while the market remained bustling with trade as usual.
1:28:23|1:28:32|A figure in black robes moved through the crowd, heading towards a dark building under the city wall. As the gentle breeze blew, it revealed that under the veil was the current Empress Wan Hou.
1:28:32|1:28:55|In the building, [Wan Hou] played with the screen in her hand, then spoke up and asked, [Wan Hou] turned her head sharply to look at the person, and then said, upon hearing what the pharmacist said,
1:28:57|1:29:14|Under the veil, [Wan Hou]'s pretty face appeared even colder. She took out a paper package from her bosom and then walked to the pharmacist's side, squatting down. Gently and tenderly, she lifted the pharmacist's hand and handed over the paper package. With a pair of innocent eyes, she looked at him and then said,
1:29:27|1:29:31|But not stingy at all with the forest in the flowing words.
1:29:31|1:29:45|After issuing the imperial edict, Li Di hastily pressed the paper package containing arsenic into the hands of the pharmacist. With numerous attendants and guards by Wan Hou's side, the pharmacist knew the outcome of acting alone and speaking too much. After handling the matter, Wan Hou did not leave.
1:29:45|1:29:53|Sitting quietly in the small building, Wan Hou was waiting for someone. After a short while, a person walked towards the small building.
1:29:53|1:30:4|Respectfully observing, it is the military governor of Youzhou, Yin Sun, who walks to Wan Hou and then bows to the ground to report back to Wan Hou. Seeing this, Wan Hou knows that Wu Luan is safe.
1:30:4|1:30:13|The filial daughter of sin left, returned to the palace, and saw her little table clothes, exposing the jade seal of the countryside, in a panic in the hall. It seems that there is a plan.
1:30:13|1:30:39|Upon hearing the call from inside, [Wan Hou] hurriedly returned from the Tang family's collapse, prostrating on the bed in a state of disarray. The maids in the shop also dressed in fine clothes to greet the emperor's arrival. The new emperor dismounted and walked up the steps, leaving the maids behind. Mistakenly thinking the interior was heading towards where [Wan Hou] had collapsed, the new emperor used a cue stick to push aside the killing cane.
1:30:39|1:30:51|Wan Hou's breath was ethereal, her long hair cascading over her jade seal, outlining her graceful figure. The new emperor, puzzled by her behavior, then asked.
1:31:18|1:31:39|Hearing what [Wan Hou] said, and seeing her winding through the light gauze, wearing few clothes, the new emperor waved his hand to dismiss the eunuchs and walked to [Wan Hou]'s bed, sat down and then said, following the new emperor's intention, [Wan Hou] was sent to Ruhuai in the suburbs, while applying makeup, a red thread was tied around the jade spine, complementing each other, making her look even more delicate.
1:31:39|1:31:48|With the new emperor's arm around her waist, [Wan Hou] spoke.
1:32:28|1:32:46|Without paying attention to the words being passed, tears of emotion lingered on the rosy cheeks of [Wan Hou]. Feeling the warmth of the new emperor's palm, hesitating slightly on the back, [Wan Hou] then continued to speak.
1:33:2|1:33:8|The new emperor lowered his head to look at the charming person in his arms, [Wan Hou] then withdrew from his embrace, and after a long gaze into each other's eyes, they finally spoke.
1:33:28|1:33:42|Hearing what the new emperor just said, [Wan Hou] seemed to be moved, and now nurturing Mingye's tomb was filled with tears, then she rushed into the arms of the new emperor, a pair of jade hairpins intertwined behind her head, tears flowing freely without constraint.
1:33:42|1:33:51|Before becoming the empress, she was just a child longing for love, but the late emperor imprisoned her without giving her his love.
1:33:51|1:34:17|[Wu Luan], who had been childhood friends with him, had never taken a step for him. Only the person in front of her poisoned the former emperor, even slaughtering the courtiers, just to make herself the empress. Perhaps it was at this moment that [Wan Hou] vaguely felt the new emperor's strong affection for him, so she allowed him to be so reckless on her body for the last time. He listened to what [Yin Jun] said, and [Yin Taichang] continued to ask while looking in the mirror.
1:34:17|1:34:35|[Wan Hou] said that since the moment the Crown Prince was forced to be a hostage, he had made up his mind. Even though the Emperor was suspicious, with all his favor and affection towards him,
1:34:59|1:35:6|He publicly announced the crime of the Emperor's senior brother usurping the throne. He did this to uphold justice for the late Emperor.
1:35:14|1:35:17|Yin Taichang was once again shocked by Yin Jun's words, his astonishment unabated.
1:35:17|1:35:26|Surprised, he had already walked to the snow leopard screen given by the new emperor and leaned against it, sighing.
1:35:50|1:36:10|Yin Taichang finished speaking, his mind filled with a thousand thoughts. His strategies in the tomb were profound, as he paced back and forth in the hall, before continuing to speak.
1:36:25|1:36:59|Facing his son's surprised gaze, [Yin Taichang] asked, fearing the confrontation with his son. The determined look in their eyes grew stronger as they locked eyes. [Yin Jun] firmly held his deputy leader's hand for support and decisively spoke. After that, he walked with his father in the dark chamber of the mansion. Sitting on the couch with a dagger in hand, [Yin Jun] saw his father take a black box from a hidden place and place it on a low table. The box contained a dark liquid, resembling ink.
1:36:59|1:37:14|With his father's approval, [Yin Jun] placed the blade of the dagger in the black liquid. As the blade soaked in the poison, a dark smoke rose, revealing the highly toxic nature of the substance. In order to ensure the success of their plan, the father and son decided to conceal the poisoned dagger and bring it to the banquet as a precaution.
1:37:14|1:37:33|At the same time, the empress was also preparing, dressed in a delicate red phoenix robe in front of the dressing table, looking like a recovered fire, wrapping herself up gracefully. She no longer had the previous childish appearance, sitting in front of the bronze mirror, adjusting the pure paper, making the red makeup appear even more intense and dazzling than on the day of her enthronement.
1:37:33|1:37:52|Now the queen's tomb, the reflection of Wang Er, no longer has the warmth of the past. Wan Hou's intuition feels the coldness. After a while, she sees her probing the screen with a long needle, taking out a poisonous powder and carefully placing it on the inside of her fingernail. After preparing, she stares at the reflection for a long time, then speaks in a stern voice, Li Di said,
1:38:39|1:38:50|The new emperor spoke eloquently, saying that after this, there would be eunuchs to record his words on the scroll of vengeance. The new emperor's intentions were clear, but his mind was preoccupied with important matters, smiling all the while, unaware of what was happening at that moment.
1:38:50|1:39:7|[Wu Luan] led the white horse through the mountains, gazing at the imperial capital in the distance. As various forces stirred in the dark, the night banquet began. Eunuchs and palace maids moved about the court, preparing delicious food and fine wine, holding up bright lanterns. Civil and military officials gradually entered the banquet.
1:39:7|1:39:13|There are also palace guards who inspect the arrivals, removing their weapons to ensure the safety of the emperor.
1:39:13|1:39:39|[Yin Jun], as a military officer, casually recited the golden armor spell to the General's Palace, and the palace attendant handed the identity token to [Yin Jun]. After [General Yin] accepted it and handed over his waist accessories to the interior decorator for safekeeping, [Yin Jun] was finally allowed to enter the evening banquet in the court hall. Even though all the officials were dressed in ceremonial attire as they entered the court hall, after the officials entered the banquet, [Yin Jun] could be seen walking around the court hall and the corridors.
1:39:39|1:40:6|All guarded by the Forbidden Army, the new emperor was about to eliminate the lineage of [Yin Taichang] from the courtiers during the night banquet. To ensure nothing went wrong, the hall was brightly lit unlike its usual gloomy appearance. The officials took their seats, dividing the court into left and right. Musicians and dancers from the palace slowly made their way into the hall, their performance weaving through the court inside and out, showcasing the grandeur of the night banquet. The musicians and dancers each performed their duties.
1:40:6|1:40:22|In front of the hall, the officials bowed to the new emperor. Seeing all the officials behaving properly, the music of the zither and the drums sounded like a tide at a night banquet, and the banquet officially began at this moment.
1:40:22|1:40:35|The new emperor and empress sat in the hall, with palace maids holding golden silk peacock feather umbrellas behind [Li Di], symbolizing the solemnity. Behind the umbrella, there was a golden screen carved with dragons and phoenixes surrounded by auspicious clouds.
1:40:35|1:40:43|It was on that day when the new emperor accepted the dragon and phoenix screen presented by the empress, indicating the new emperor's deep love for the empress without a doubt.
1:40:43|1:40:52|When investigating the late emperor, the Snow Mountain Black Panther Jade Screen was placed here as a warning, reminding those who rise to power to exercise restraint in order to seek the world.
1:40:52|1:41:18|Now that the country is easy to defend, the Empress Dowager is once again in harmony with her brother, comparing themselves to a dragon and phoenix. They are happily drinking under this golden screen, not knowing what the late emperor would feel. When the officials see [Li Di] like this, they also relax and smile, some chatting freely, some dancing and singing, immersed in the joy of the court, presenting a harmonious scene of unity between ruler and subjects.
1:41:18|1:41:45|In the midst of this flourishing era, unbeknownst to many, hidden currents were already stirring beneath the surface. Among the civil and military officials, only [Yin Taichang] and his son [Yin Jun] refrained from practicing singing and dancing, drinking sparingly, and cautiously observing the movements of the empress in the palace. At this moment, as the palace dancers gathered together in their gossamer attire, gracefully dancing before the empress and the court officials, all eyes were drawn to them, leading the courtiers into a state of bliss.
1:41:45|1:41:53|The empress Wan Hou secretly put poison powder into the golden cup, then pretended to chat and laugh with the new emperor Li Di to make him lower his guard.
1:41:53|1:42:7|His Highness Taichang, [Yin Jun], with sharp eyes like torches, noticed the Queen's intentions. He realized that the golden goblet contained a deadly poison, but remained calm and composed, quietly observing the situation. The Queen then took the goblet and drank from it.
1:42:15|1:42:32|Upon hearing the Empress's words, Wan Hou gestured in the great hall, dismissing the musicians and dancers. She then instructed the eunuch to bring a wine jug to the Empress, who raised a golden goblet in a toast. As she tapped the chopping board, the Empress spoke out loud.
1:42:53|1:43:1|The queen then received the golden statue from the new emperor, knelt down, was helped up by the new emperor, and whispered something mysterious in his ear.
1:43:6|1:43:22|With this one blow, the new emperor, [Li Di], smiled with joy and anticipation. Taking the golden cup from [Wan Hou], he held it in front of him and spoke.
1:43:28|1:43:34|All raised their cups in unison, with both civil and military officials responding. From the emperor and empress dowager to the courtiers, everyone showed a joyful expression.
1:43:34|1:44:2|The new emperor smiled as he gazed at the splendid scene for a long time, about to eavesdrop on the conversation. Suddenly, a female voice from the shop said that the young lady [Qing Nv] was performing a song and dance for the emperor and empress in the county town. Following the sound, the new emperor saw [Qing Nv] dressed in white leading a group of performers on stage to bow to the emperor and empress. The new emperor temporarily refrained from drinking, and turned to [Yin Taichang] to ask for his opinion. Taichang praised the performance.
1:44:40|1:44:46|Seeing [Qing Nv] and [Wan Hou] embracing, the Empress showed no emotion in her eyes, while the new Emperor couldn't help but sigh with emotion.
1:45:12|1:45:31|Seeing the new emperor decisive, the empress couldn't help but show a consistent expression. The eunuch who saw the situation took the golden cup from the new emperor's hand and gave it to [Qing Nv] on the platform to thank the court lady [Qing Nv]. [Qing Nv] doesn't drink, and the imperial intention cannot be violated. The eunuch said so, and [Qing Nv] then took the golden cup and spoke.
1:45:41|1:46:3|Taking it as a rebuke for her own decision, Wan Hou smiled and sipped from the golden cup. As the cup was returned to its place, Yin Jun, seated as a guest, could only watch as she drank the poisoned wine. Qing Nv, unaware of her own fate, would later don the mask once worn by the prince after departing from the mortal world. Emperor Li Di and Empress Wu Luan then took their seats.
1:46:7|1:46:14|Unnoticed by everyone present, behind [Qing Nv], a spiritual figure with a mask on had eyes that were particularly intense and unusual.
1:47:32|1:47:37|Not to mention that at this moment, to commemorate the deceased emperor's son with music and dance, [Qing Nv] led several courtesans to perform on the stage.
1:48:26|1:48:52|With a shimmering gaze, Wan Hou looked at the electric puppet without a word, her expression frozen. It was unclear whether she was grieving for Qing Nv's death or furious about the exposure of the plan. In the scene, the performer laid Qing Nv on the stage and anxiously revealed her true face by removing the mask, revealing the resurrected Wu Luan. The new emperor was incredulous at this unexpected turn of events.
1:49:2|1:49:14|Seeing Wan Hou struggling in front of him, trying to say something, but coughing up blood that flowed into his ear canal along his cheek, it took a while before he recovered and smiled with tears in his eyes.
1:49:28|1:49:56|Upon hearing [Wu Luan] sobbing and speaking in such a manner, [Qing Nv] finally felt content, her strength depleted, and she quietly lay in [Wu Luan]'s arms. Unable to bear it any longer, [Yin Jun] pushed away the precious jade plate in front of him, and was carried away by the divine energy onto the stage.
1:49:56|1:50:24|Kneeling before the body of [Qing Nv], [Yin Jun] seemed unable to believe it, watching the blood flowing from his younger sister without daring to move. After a while, he pushed [Wu Luan] away as if going mad, pulling [Qing Nv] into his arms. As she breathed her last, [Yin Taichang] also overflowed with sorrow, trembling all over as he only held onto Changfu. Witnessing this tragic scene, all the civil and military officials in the court knew that there was poison in the wine. At this moment, no one dared to speak up.
1:50:24|1:50:44|In the court, as the new shoots emerge, holding the little sister and speaking softly about the depth of Kekexili, on the stage [Yin Jun] has already lost his mind, completely ignoring the empress dowager, immersed in the pain of losing the little sister. The new emperor sits on the dragon throne, quietly observing the situation in the court.
1:50:44|1:50:53|Although Wan Hou appeared desolate, tears welled up in her eyes. She turned slowly like a dying person and looked at the Empress Dowager standing by her side.
1:50:53|1:51:9|The woman who should have been the mother of the world, at this moment, her tears stained with makeup, fell down with the momentum, trembling with the queen's body. It's just unknown for whom her tears flow. The new emperor, greatly shocked, already knew the truth in his heart, but still hesitated to speak and asked the queen.
1:51:14|1:51:26|Empress Wan Hou's words were light and innocent, not meeting the eyes of the new emperor. She stubbornly replied that even the empress herself did not want to see her. The new emperor slowly stood up, half kneeling in front of her, trembling as he reached out his hands.
1:51:26|1:51:35|Resting on the Empress's cheek, the action may seem simple, but it seems to drain the new Emperor of all his strength. As he forces the Empress to look at him.
1:51:35|1:51:40|When their eyes met, they trembled and asked.
1:51:48|1:52:8|The new emperor asked the empress for permission, and she answered affirmatively. After a moment of silence, the new emperor finally said he had heard about it. The empress looked at him for a long time and then said coldly, staring at the new emperor.
1:52:8|1:52:17|The new emperor stood up trembling, tears streaming down his face. With his back to the courtiers, he spoke loudly.
1:52:21|1:53:3|Upon hearing this, the eunuch glanced at [Li Di], the two of them did not see eye to eye, each shedding tears. The new emperor looked up at the sky and sighed, "The woman who seeks independence is right here on the stage." [Wu Luan] then shook the Yue Maiden Sword from her sleeve, its blade emitting a fierce aura. [Li Di] shouted out, and [Wu Luan] naturally knew that the new emperor had set up a banquet by his side. However, her heartache and the loss of casual words made her completely disregard the dangers at this moment.
1:53:11|1:53:39|In the dimly lit dome, under the moonlight, [Wu Luan] was blocked by several Linwei soldiers and trapped within the formation. Wu Luan halted his steps, raised his spear to defend against the others, facing off with the remaining Linwei soldiers. At that moment, the new emperor's voice echoed loudly from the inner chamber, calling for the Imperial Guards to protect him. Without hesitation, countless Imperial Guards rushed in, clad in armor and wielding spears, standing in the grand hall leading to where the new emperor was held on the long street.
1:53:39|1:54:9|To ensure his safety, [Wu Luan] did not dare to take any risks. As he pondered how to respond to the solemn and murderous atmosphere, he suddenly heard the Imperial Guards rushing towards him from behind. He leaped into the air and fiercely kicked out, forcing the two men to retreat. Upon landing, he swiftly turned around and thrust his short sword forward, shattering the masks of the guards in front of him. The force was so great that the guards fell to the ground and struggled to get up. Meanwhile, [Wu Luan] skillfully used a rope to connect the sword hilt, turning the short sword into a long whip, displaying remarkable agility and strength.
1:54:9|1:54:16|The time limit is like a fierce tiger, advancing and retreating like a dragon, and the soft sword of [Wu Luan] is already known for close combat.
1:54:16|1:54:29|Currently, [Wu Luan] uses the long edge to control and defeat the enemy from three feet away, making it difficult for the enemy to get close. With a short sword in hand, [Wu Luan] moves like a giant eagle, aiming straight at the new emperor, and then continues to say
1:54:50|1:55:4|In the court, the new emperor ordered the Imperial Guards to make way, took a golden goblet from the table, looked back at [Wu Luan] below the hall, and then spoke loudly.
1:55:6|1:55:12|After speaking, the new emperor raised the golden goblet, passed through the Feather Forest Guards from both sides, steadily climbed the steps, and walked towards the throne to sit down.
1:55:12|1:55:20|The queen had wiped away her tears and restored her composure, but her face turned cold as she saw the situation changing drastically. She then saw her brother handing her a poisoned drink.
1:55:20|1:55:36|Approaching [Wu Luan], the atmosphere became tense, and for a moment, the new emperor, fearless, stood under the blade, looking at [Wu Luan], and spoke.
1:56:15|1:56:24|With his eyes fixed on this spot, the new emperor seemed to have thought of something. He slowly raised his head and looked up at the dome of the hall, tears shimmering in his eyes, lost in thought for a long time.
1:56:24|1:56:29|Choked with a lump in his throat, [Wan Hou] finally spoke.
1:56:43|1:56:50|With that, she lowered her eyes, paying no attention to the wind in front of her, avoiding looking confused, and then sighed deeply.
1:57:3|1:57:20|After saying so, the new emperor took the golden goblet under [Wu Luan]'s sword, placed it near his lips, and swallowed the poisoned wine forcefully. [Wu Luan] did not understand, but did not stop him either, only silently watching his uncle swallow the poisoned wine. After a moment, the new emperor threw the goblet aside, feeling uncomfortable, with a sense of breathlessness and unsteady steps.
1:57:20|1:57:30|The queen saw the new emperor like this, her shoulders trembling, tears in her eyes, not knowing whether she was sad for not wanting to part with the new emperor or happy for getting what she wanted.
1:57:30|1:57:59|Feeling that his end was near, the new emperor turned and walked towards the palace, removing the officials on the way, and the imperial guards on the street took them off and brought them to the empress's side, placing them at her feet. Then, the new emperor collapsed in the empress's arms, weakly saying that by doing so he had exhausted his strength, and then he lay down in the empress's arms, looking at her.
1:57:59|1:58:6|With a pair of jade hands covering her face, tears streaming down, Wan Hou, who was calm and composed just a moment ago, has now disappeared without a trace.
1:58:6|1:58:10|It must be that the new emperor is so infatuated, hence the tears flow uncontrollably.
1:58:10|1:58:23|The new emperor died suddenly from drinking poison, causing everyone to kneel down and cry out. With the emperor's passing, the court officials all dressed in mourning to show their respect.
1:58:23|1:58:30|The Imperial Guards are no longer on guard against division, His Highness remains unmoved like a mountain, as if witnessing the new emperor's death from poison.
1:58:32|1:58:38|[Wu Luan] then removed the rope from his wrist, along with the short sword, avenging his great enemy. He looked up at the dome above.
1:58:38|1:58:45|At this moment, Wan Hou, who was mourning the late king, saw the empress kneeling behind him and speaking, "Your Majesty,"
1:58:56|1:59:3|No matter how you handle it, the Empress Dowager spoke up in front of him and listened to [Wu Luan]. She said to call this evil name.
1:59:16|1:59:40|[Wu Luan] grabbed the sword blade, only to hear [Yin Jun] say that it was poisoned. In just a moment, the wound where [Wu Luan] was cut by the dagger had already festered. In the blink of an eye, the Empress remained cold-faced, using a short sword to pierce through the throat of [Wu Luan], then turning to examine the wound.
2:0:9|2:0:30|The dagger's poison is fierce, and [Wu Luan] has no desire to live. Now that the great revenge has been avenged, she chooses to die as the poison takes effect.
2:0:33|2:0:37|Wan Hou called out desperately for her lover's life,
2:0:37|2:0:49|He had planned everything meticulously but never expected to end up like this. In the grand hall lay the bodies of the four children of the former emperor and the current emperor, with no one paying attention to them among the civil and military officials.
2:0:49|2:0:57|Sitting as a guest, Wan Hou observed the situation in the court quietly with her head down, while the courtiers remained indifferent, which was quite rare. At the banquet tonight,
2:0:57|2:1:32|In the morning court, the candles filled the hall, as bright as daylight. Just now, with the interweaving of silk and light, the birds sang and the swallows danced. But now it is extremely desolate and cold, with a heavy atmosphere. [Wan Hou] is in this cold forest, embracing [Wu Luan] who has lost her body. Just as she is struggling to heal herself, a sudden realization dawns on the court. With respect and awe, they call out to [Wan Hou], "Long live the Empress!" The night banquet comes to an end, and it is [Wan Hou] alone who ascends the throne, bringing the curtain down.
2:1:32|2:1:36|The one he loves and the one who loves him have all gone.
2:1:51|2:2:8|In the midst of this heavy snowfall, [Yin Taichang] appeared, disheveled and covered in snow, walking in the world at the twilight of his life. Only the snow-covered Xuanbao Jade Screen from the Snow Mountain accompanied him, as if mocking [Yin Taichang], hiding in the ice and snow the long-awaited love of his life.
2:2:8|2:2:15|The clear sky and boundless horizon only witnessed the tragic scene of the white-haired bidding farewell to the black-haired. In the midst of the weaving and dyeing, [Wan Hou] appeared desolate and sorrowful, with no words spoken by her son.
2:3:21|2:3:33|At this point, [Wan Hou] actually smiled foolishly, today he did not apply makeup, his face was pale, as if he had regained the appearance of the past. He almost crouched on the ground, trembling with both hands.
2:3:33|2:3:43|Caressing the crimson silk fabric that had shaped him into what he is today, caressing the desires that were once fiery and tumultuous but now have fallen silent.
2:4:32|2:4:47|At this point, as the sword edge vies for fame, a short sword from an unknown origin clashes with the snow, piercing through the hall and into the residence of [Wan Hou]. Surprisingly, as the surrounding maids and female attendants flee, not a single one steps forward to help.
2:4:47|2:4:52|[Wan Hou] Dai Mei felt a burning sensation on her chest as she threw the scarlet and white fabric from her arms.
2:4:52|2:5:4|[Wan Hou] endured the sharp pain in her chest and abdomen as she saw the soft sword of the Yue woman pierce through where her heart was, just as she was about to investigate, the short sword was pulled away and disappeared without a trace.
2:5:4|2:5:31|Turning around, she saw in the vast snow a person she never expected to see, a woman holding a dripping blood-stained short sword, [Wan Hou] was shocked in her dream, struggling to point towards the person as if wanting to say something, but eventually ran out of strength. Chen Shizhi was in the middle, and the assailant did not approach to investigate, only soaking the short sword in the water jar in the courtyard, causing numerous water plants to splash, then leaving.
