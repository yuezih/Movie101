0:4:8|0:4:11|The story begins with the Fox Clan's residence in Qing Qiu.
0:4:11|0:4:18|In the realm resembling the edge of the sky, Monkey Immortal is currently fighting with Squirrel Immortal over a piece of food.
0:4:26|0:4:39|Seeing [Bai Qian] running towards the distance, the monkey fairy scratched his ear and cheek, reached out his arm to grab a thin vine above his head, leaped onto a tree branch and transformed back into his true form as a monkey. After waiting for the injured squirrel fairy to catch up, he chased after [Bai Qian] together.
0:4:39|0:4:44|Lu Xian is squatting on the ground, carefully examining the mushrooms he just picked.
0:4:44|0:4:50|He couldn't help but chuckle when he saw [Sun Wukong] in a hurry, then he also transformed into his true form.
0:4:50|0:4:54|He has a graceful figure, handsome like a dumpling, and is covered with round spots.
0:4:54|0:5:3|Running towards the direction of Monkey Immortal under the lead of Squirrel Immortal, [Bai Qian] with her black hair flowing, her long skirt spreading out behind her as she moves.
0:5:3|0:5:8|Running along the way, he encountered a fallen tree stump, leaped joyfully and transformed into a nine-tailed fox.
0:5:9|0:5:17|The fluffy tail was raised high, the body moved lightly, and the soft fur of the tattoo fluttered with the wind, looking disdainful and charming.
0:5:17|0:5:22|The monkey spirit roamed through the forest with the help of vines, quickly catching up to [Bai Qian].
0:5:22|0:5:28|The wolf fairy also refused to show weakness, running wild in the woods, while not far away, Miggu was also running in the woods.
0:5:28|0:5:32|Mi Gu is a tree spirit that absorbs the essence of the sun and moon to cultivate into human form.
0:5:38|0:5:43|[Bai Qian] turned a deaf ear and, after a quick sprint, she returned to her residence.
0:6:16|0:6:22|Mi Gu handed Bai Qian the invitation sent by the East Sea Water King, and Bai Qian looked at it for a while.
0:7:29|0:7:34|The rice fields have been harvested, the frost has arrived, and [Bai Qian] has just decided to visit the East Sea Dragon Palace.
0:7:34|0:7:45|A giant jellyfish swam up to Bai Qian with the waves, fully extending its umbrella-like body. Once Bai Qian stood firmly on it, the jellyfish retracted its umbrella.
0:7:46|0:7:57|Wrapped in [Bai Qian], the whole figure resembled a balloon, with tendrils trailing behind swaying as she floated towards the Dragon Palace in the East Sea.
0:7:57|0:8:14|In the Eastern Sea, one of the Four Seas, the scenery is wonderfully beautiful. Mountains, lakes, and sea reefs are colorful, and marvelous little fish roam in the gorgeous coral bushes. At a glance, there are endless varieties of coral bushes. Suddenly, a magnificent Dragon Palace appears in front of the eyes.
0:8:21|0:8:25|She furrowed her brows, covered her eyes with her hand, and quickly put on the ribbon prepared by Mo Yuan.
0:9:0|0:9:3|Two fairies were tripped by [Bai Qian] using a little trick.
0:9:11|0:9:16|[Bai Qian] had already left the main hall and came to the Coral Garden alone.
0:9:21|0:9:29|Speak up, [Ye Hua] finished the last sip of wine in the jug and angrily threw it away.
0:9:29|0:9:31|Bai Qian turned her head and saw a little boy.
0:9:54|0:9:58|Bai Qian couldn't help but laugh when she heard him say that.
0:9:58|0:10:4|[Bai Qian] got up and followed the little sticky rice ball to a secluded coral thicket.
0:10:15|0:10:19|[Bai Qian] searched everywhere in the Coral Maze, but still couldn't find any trace of her.
0:10:19|0:10:24|She didn't know that a woman disguised as a soldier, wearing the clothes of a shrimp and crab, had kidnapped the dumplings.
0:10:24|0:10:34|Halfway, the fan that was taken by the bun fell down. [Bai Qian] was furious and struck the person on the shoulder and neck, causing the person to drop the child and almost fall to the ground.
0:10:47|0:10:52|Unexpectedly, at this moment, Tuanzi picked up the fan from the ground and gently waved it in the direction of the two.
0:10:52|0:11:0|Suddenly, a strong wind rose up, and [Xuan Nv] took the opportunity to escape. When [Bai Qian] realized this, she took back the fan from her.
0:11:2|0:11:8|Tuanzi lowered her head, her face full of grievances.
0:11:10|0:11:16|[Bai Qian] mistakenly thought the newcomer was the demon clan [Xuan Nv] in disguise, so she spoke coldly to her.
0:11:23|0:11:42|After speaking, he directly swung his sword towards the person, in the fight, the person tried to remove the ribbon sewn in front of his eyes, after several unsuccessful attempts, he used his long sword to pick open the ribbon, neatly put the sword back into the scabbard, he looked at [Bai Qian] with her face completely uncovered, his eyes immediately filled with shock, the ribbon that [Bai Qian] lost.
0:11:42|0:11:43|Covering his eyes in frustration.
0:11:46|0:11:51|Beside her, Ali couldn't believe her eyes and rushed over to hug [Bai Qian].
0:13:18|0:13:21|Ye Hua flashed a smug smile and took a step towards [Bai Qian].
0:14:6|0:14:13|Bai Qian was so angry with this father and son that she turned around and tried to leave the scene.
0:14:13|0:14:28|A woman hurriedly walked towards [Ye Hua], but stopped in her tracks when she saw [Bai Qian].
0:14:28|0:14:30|Hearing this, the woman quickly avoided [Bai Qian]'s gaze.
0:14:48|0:15:3|After speaking, [Bai Qian] brushed her sleeves and left the Coral Palace. When the banquet was over, she was ready to return to Qingqiu from the bottom of the sea. However, thinking that she had nothing else to do, she detoured halfway to the Ten-Mile Peach Blossom east of the East Sea, intending to ask Zhe Yan, the High God, for two jars of peach blossom wine.
0:15:4|0:15:13|At this time, it is the season when peach blossoms are in full bloom. The Ten-Mile Peach Blossom Forest is filled with peach blossoms from beginning to end, covering the mountains and plains, vibrant in color like a raging fire.
0:15:13|0:15:32|After Zhe Yan whistled, tens of thousands of hummingbirds fluttered among the peach trees, their wings trembling, causing the trees to rustle. The peach trees shed their petals, with thousands of petals falling gently into the stream in the forest. Some petals fell from between the rocks into Zhe Yan's wine-making pool, and thus the peach blossom wine was born.
0:15:57|0:16:0|Bai Qian explained the situation to Zhe Yan in detail.
0:16:23|0:16:38|After Bai Qian swallowed the peach blossom in her mouth, she voiced the doubts in her heart.
0:16:38|0:16:44|Bai Qian approached and questioned, causing Zhe Yan to pause his action of tasting the wine.
0:16:44|0:16:48|Upon hearing this, [Bai Qian] stopped asking further questions and later returned to Qing Qiu.
0:17:35|0:17:44|If you are deliberately looking for trouble, then don't bother talking nonsense. [Ye Hua] heard the goods and stood up, with a smile on his face, unable to hide his joy.
0:18:12|0:18:15|[Ye Hua] turned to [Bai Qian] and said.
0:18:40|0:18:44|[Bai Qian] angrily pulled her sleeve and then left the room in a huff.
0:18:44|0:18:48|The next morning, she was sleeping in bed as usual.
0:18:48|0:18:50|[Ye Hua] came to her with Ali.
0:19:5|0:19:10|[Bai Qian] covered herself with a blanket, let out a long sigh, and then left with the two of them.
0:20:23|0:20:25|Mo Yuan was unfortunately engulfed in poisonous flames.
0:20:25|0:20:28|[Ye Hua] chuckled at his comical antics.
0:20:28|0:20:32|Later, he pulled down the vine controlling the water, letting the water flow into the basin filled with vegetables.
0:20:32|0:20:37|After washing them clean, she quickly cut them up with her excellent knife skills.
0:20:37|0:20:39|After seeing it, Bai Qian was full of admiration.
0:20:39|0:20:42|He patted the fish tail with the back of the knife, and the scales all over the body fell off one after another.
0:20:43|0:21:2|Using immortal techniques to burn firewood and boil water, then soaking the noodles and water in the air at the same time, the dough instantly formed into noodles as he swung them up and down between his hands. On the side, Bai Qian watched intently, while Ye Hua flicked the noodles towards Bai Qian, then skillfully retracted them, before coming to stand in front of Bai Qian.
0:21:2|0:21:4|Strands of noodles swirled around [Bai Qian] like ribbons.
0:21:5|0:21:7|Suddenly, the flesh seemed to turn into a long whip.
0:21:11|0:21:16|[Ye Hua] skillfully fries the fish before stewing it, adding carrots and other side dishes for decoration.
0:21:16|0:21:20|Before long, a table full of sumptuous dishes appeared.
0:21:20|0:21:24|[Bai Qian] lifted a bowl of fish soup, scooped half a spoonful with a spoon and tasted it.
0:21:39|0:21:48|After speaking, he paused for a moment, his hand holding the fish soup suspended in midair.
0:21:48|0:21:51|After dinner, Mi Gu accompanied Ali to play games in the woods.
0:22:21|0:22:32|Ye Hua repeatedly made requests, Bai Qian immediately put away the just hung up xiangrong, and picked up the wine jug.
0:22:32|0:22:37|Bai Qian angrily threw the wine jug lid at him, but he just smiled faintly.
0:22:40|0:22:45|[Bai Qian] looked displeased, but [Ye Hua] found her expression intriguing.
0:22:45|0:22:49|[Ye Hua] As night falls, a bright moon hangs high above the horizon.
0:22:49|0:22:52|[Bai Qian] is getting ready to go to sleep.
0:23:18|0:23:28|One person lay in front and the other lay behind on the bed. [Bai Qian] tried to sleep as close to the edge of the bed as possible, pulling a corner of the blanket over to cover half of her body.
0:23:37|0:23:57|Sensing [Ye Hua] approaching her, [Bai Qian] felt uneasy and shifted away towards the edge of the bed. Seeing this, [Ye Hua] simply got up and leaned directly beside [Bai Qian].
0:23:57|0:24:4|That night finally passed, and early the next morning, [Bai Qian] was looking at what [Ye Hua] had done for her the day before when a voice sounded behind her.
0:24:10|0:24:16|[Bai Qian] took down the wine pot from the high shelf and poured a cup of wine for Ali, when Migui suddenly appeared.
0:24:34|0:24:37|After Ali finished drinking, she passed the wine glass over again.
0:24:37|0:24:42|Ali's eyes gradually became unfocused, and after swaying a few times, she fell to the ground with a thud.
0:25:2|0:25:5|Ye Hua looked at Ali lying on the bed and asked.
0:25:5|0:25:7|[Bai Qian] smiled and said to him.
0:25:36|0:25:40|Ye Hua released Ali's hand, suppressing his anger, and stood up to look at [Bai Qian].
0:25:51|0:25:58|The two of them fell silent for a while, but Ali suddenly got up with a big smile, and after laughing, she lay back down on the bed.
0:25:58|0:26:7|Seeing A Li was just drunk, [Ye Hua] quickly grabbed her hand again, looking at A Li who was sleeping soundly, her anxious heart finally relaxed.
0:26:7|0:26:14|[Bai Qian] relaxed as her tense heart finally calmed down. She shook her sleeve and walked out of the room quietly.
0:26:14|0:26:18|They then arrived at the Peach Blossom Forest.
0:26:52|0:27:8|Prince Tian Sun, my mother has long forgotten about you. Following Ali's footsteps, [Su Jin] arrived at the Salt Slide Cave in the Maze Valley, where she was stunned to see a man's body attached to an ice coffin.
0:28:2|0:28:8|Upon hearing Bai Qian's words, Su Jin's body froze in place, and the two stood facing each other in a standoff.
0:28:13|0:28:16|Ali quickly hid behind Bai Qian as soon as she saw Su Jin.
0:28:16|0:28:18|Ali quickly hid behind Bai Qian's pavilion as soon as she saw Su Jin.
0:28:18|0:28:23|Ali quickly hid behind Bai Qian as soon as she saw Su Jin.
0:28:23|0:28:26|Ali quickly hid behind Bai Qian as soon as she saw Su Jin.
0:28:26|0:28:29|Ali quickly hid behind [Bai Qian] as soon as she saw [Su Jin].
0:28:29|0:28:34|Ali quickly hid behind Bai Qian as soon as she saw Su Jin.
0:28:41|0:28:48|[Susu] remained silent, leaving Qing Qiu behind, [Xuan Nv] was crying endlessly facing the deep abyss.
0:29:0|0:29:4|[Xuan Nv] heard a voice and quickly turned around to see [Susu] walking towards her.
0:29:41|0:29:45|Siyin coldly finished speaking about everything known in the East Sea.
0:29:46|0:29:50|Upon hearing Xuan Nv's question, Su Jin smiled and looked at her.
0:30:1|0:30:5|[Ye Hua] brought [Bai Qian] to the Junqi Mountain in the mortal realm.
0:30:5|0:30:9|This mountain is called Junqi, the closest place to the mortal realm from the immortal realm.
0:30:14|0:30:20|[Bai Qian] looked around at the surroundings, with thatched cottages on the mountain surrounded by trees on three sides.
0:30:20|0:30:25|[Ye Hua] walked into the room, continuously striking two pieces of flint together.
0:30:29|0:30:38|After finishing speaking, he prepared to start a fire with his immortal technique, but [Siyin] quickly stopped him.
0:30:46|0:30:49|After Ye Hua finished speaking, he coaxed Siyin to sleep.
0:30:49|0:30:53|[Bai Qian] had nothing to do, so she wandered around the room.
0:30:53|0:30:56|She looked at the furnishings in the room and walked to a table.
0:30:56|0:31:3|There was an old painting on the table, covered with a thick layer of dust. [Bai Qian] leaned down to examine it carefully.
0:31:3|0:31:7|The woman in the painting has delicate eyebrows and a charming appearance.
0:31:7|0:31:13|She breathed out a sigh, blowing away the dust on the painting, and the woman's face in the painting became clear.
0:31:13|0:31:14|Bai Qian couldn't help but feel sorrowful in her heart.
0:31:18|0:31:25|Bai Qian's gaze never left the painting.
0:31:25|0:31:30|[Ye Hua] watches as [Bai Qian] looks at the painting attentively.
0:31:30|0:31:34|[Bai Qian] looked at the woman in the painting and smiled.
0:31:34|0:31:42|[Ye Hua] looked at her smiling, and in a daze, he seemed to see the figure of [Susu] on her, so he started talking to her about the past.
0:32:0|0:32:10|Ye Hua, who fell into the mortal realm, collapsed on Junji Mountain. He was seen by Susu passing by. Susu looked at his picturesque brows and eyes, as if he were asleep, and called out softly.
0:32:51|0:32:59|[Ye Hua] was taken aback when he heard the news, then stood up and stood directly in front of [Susu], before speaking.
0:33:0|0:33:6|[Susu] didn't expect that the absurd words she casually said were taken seriously by [Ye Hua].
0:33:23|0:33:28|One day, [Susu] was preparing to cook, while [Ye Hua] looked at a piece of wood.
0:33:42|0:33:52|If I could stay by his side all the time, I would be willing to fall into the mortal world. [Susu] lit the fire in no time.
0:34:19|0:34:21|[Ye Hua] walks and talks.
0:34:21|0:34:24|Bai Qian is telling about her past with Susu.
0:34:24|0:34:33|Suddenly, she stopped under a peach tree in the courtyard, where [Susu] was holding a ball of yarn, slowly knitting a piece of clothing.
0:34:43|0:34:52|At that time, during the peak season of peach blossoms, [Ye Hua] approached to admire the peach blossoms.
0:34:52|0:35:3|He reached out a hand to [Susu], who looked at him lovingly, then ran towards him and threw herself into his arms, with a smile on her face that only grew wider.
0:35:5|0:35:8|After embracing for a long time, the two slowly separated.
0:35:8|0:35:13|[Susu] couldn't help but kiss [Ye Hua] as she looked at him.
0:35:13|0:35:18|Bai Qian and Ye Hua are holding hands under the peach tree, gazing affectionately at each other.
0:35:42|0:35:47|Facing the questioning from [Bai Qian], [Ye Hua] lowered his eyes in contemplation, then glanced at the peach tree after a moment.
0:35:50|0:35:57|After Ye Hua finished speaking, he turned and entered the thatched cottage without saying more, leaving Bai Qian alone under the peach tree, lost in thought.
0:35:57|0:36:5|Nightfall gradually descends, the sky darkens, and countless sky lanterns scatter in the air. Ah Li lights up the sky lantern in [Bai Qian]'s hand.
0:36:52|0:36:56|After hearing Bai Qian's wish, Ye Hua recalled Susu from three hundred years ago.
0:37:5|0:37:24|In the past, [Susu], just like today's [Bai Qian], held a sky lantern in her hands, closed her eyes, crossed her index fingers in front of her chest, then released the lantern from her hands, watching it slip away from her fingertips, slowly flying into the sky, merging into a sea of lanterns. The lanterns scattered all over the sky, resembling thousands of twinkling stars.
0:37:25|0:37:44|The pitch-black night sky was adorned with brilliance. The next morning, Ye Hua sat in front of the dressing table facing the bronze mirror, with [Bai Qian] holding the tomb book and combing his long hair for him. As he looked at the characters in the mirror, it seemed as if he had returned to three hundred years ago, when [Susu] was also standing behind him like [Bai Qian].
0:37:44|0:37:53|Using the same technique and posture to help him stand up, three hundred years later today, after [Bai Qian] arrived at Junji Mountain, all of this appeared in his mind one by one.
0:38:3|0:38:11|[Bai Qian] combs through Ye Hua's long hair, gathers it up on top of his head, then puts on a jade crown and uses hairpins to secure the hair.
0:38:17|0:38:22|[Bai Qian] half-bowed her body, watching Ye Hua with his well-styled hair in the bronze mirror, lost in thought.
0:38:22|0:38:41|Upon returning to Qingqiu, [Bai Qian] went straight to Yanhua Cave. She placed one hand on the ice coffin, and immediately, the fairy vines around the coffin climbed up her arm to her chest. In an instant, they ruthlessly pierced into her heart, causing her body to tremble uncontrollably as the vines greedily absorbed her heart's blood.
0:38:42|0:38:47|Transmitting slowly through his own meridians to the sleeping [Mo Yuan] in the inn.
0:38:47|0:39:0|[Bai Qian] looked at [Mo Yuan], recalling the battle of the Ghost Tribe seventy thousand years ago. [Mo Yuan] wielded his long sword and descended from high above, using all his cultivation to seal the Ghost Lord Qin Cang inside the ice of the Eastern Yellow River.
0:39:51|0:39:57|[Bai Qian] looked at [Mo Yuan], took a sip of wine and tears welled up in her eyes.
0:40:5|0:40:16|Above the Heavenly Realm, the clouds are swirling, giving a surreal feeling. Gradually, the misty fog dissipates, revealing a distant, looming palace.
0:40:16|0:40:31|[Ye Hua] sat at the desk in the hall, absentmindedly watching the lamp on the table, even when [Su Jin] walked up to her table with a teapot, poured tea into the cup, she remained oblivious, just staring at the lamp for a long time. [Su Jin] approached and softly called out,
0:40:36|0:40:36|Turned around and left.
0:40:36|0:40:39|[Bai Qian] in order to find out
0:41:24|0:41:34|Mistaken identity, [Bai Qian] pondered Zhe Yan's words and returned to the Salt Sliding Cave. She saw Mi Gu and asked him in confusion.
0:41:45|0:41:51|Mo Yuan accidentally fell down the stairs, but Bai Qian suddenly fell ill and transformed into Xuan Nv.
0:41:51|0:41:54|At this moment, the figure of [Siyin] also appeared at the entrance of Yanhua Cave.
0:41:54|0:42:2|He looked at Mo Yuan, who was being taken care of by Xuan Nv after fainting on the ground, snorted coldly, and then led Xuan Nv into the cave.
0:42:2|0:42:8|[Xuan Nv] looked at [Mo Yuan] lying in the hotel, recalling a scene from seventy thousand years ago in the East Sea Palace.
0:42:44|0:42:48|After Xuan Nv left, the real Bai Qian rushed back from the stone peach forest and questioned with a puzzled expression.
0:43:45|0:43:53|Zhe Yan transformed into a phoenix and brought [Bai Qian] to the Grand Purple Palace.
0:43:53|0:43:55|Zhe Yan quickly deals with the guard with a big leg.
0:44:1|0:44:3|[Bai Qian] heard it and immediately rushed in.
0:44:9|0:44:16|[Xuan Nv] at this moment, holding chicken wings containing a stillborn fetus, [Bai Qian] had already rushed into the main hall of the ancestral palace, dealing with a small group of ghost craftsmen.
0:44:43|0:44:51|Thousands of ghosts stood still with long knives and swords in their hands, watching as Zhe Yan took out a wine flask from his pocket and drank heartily.
0:44:51|0:45:0|After taking a few sips, he held the wine pot up high and a iron sword pierced through it, followed by a large firework bursting into flames in the sky.
0:45:0|0:45:9|In the palace, [Bai Qian] waved the hand holding the sword lightly, transforming the Kunlun fan into a long sword, then back into the shape of a fan, but the fan leaves turned into restraints for a blade.
0:45:9|0:45:15|[Bai Qian] raised the Kunlun fan and swung it forcefully twice, sending several ghost soldiers flying out.
0:45:15|0:45:18|She bypassed the few ghosts and ran straight towards [Xuan Nv].
0:45:18|0:45:29|[Xuan Nv] used her internal force to push out her outer garment, trying to briefly block [Bai Qian]'s line of sight. However, [Bai Qian] quickly avoided the sharp knives behind the outer garment, pressing [Xuan Nv] relentlessly. [Bai Qian] leaped and hovered in mid-air.
0:45:29|0:45:38|Revealing her nine tails, she swiftly landed on the ground, made a quick turn, and the power of her tails directly caused several ghost soldiers surrounding her to give up their pursuit.
0:45:38|0:45:46|Using one tail, he curled up the last ghost general, then with another tail, he heavily slapped him in the face, finally throwing him down a deep abyss.
0:45:46|0:45:54|Seeing [Xuan Nv] rushing over, he easily flicked [Xuan Nv] away with his tail, but [Xuan Nv] crashed into the ice coffin not far away in the courtyard.
0:45:54|0:45:57|After getting up, he engaged in another fight with [Bai Qian].
0:45:57|0:46:4|On the way, a ghost suddenly appeared, and [Bai Qian] threw him out with her tail, only to unexpectedly collide with the ice coffin in the tomb courtyard again.
0:46:4|0:46:13|The ice coffin gradually shifted from its original position after repeated impacts. After several rounds of fighting, [Xuan Nv] was attacked in succession by [Bai Qian]'s nine tails, and ended up falling to the ground in a sorry state.
0:46:13|0:46:18|At this moment, the two only noticed the ice coffin in the tomb and the dead fetus crystal on the ice coffin.
0:46:18|0:46:28|As the ice coffin was about to fall into the endless abyss, [Bai Qian] transformed her tail into a ribbon and forcefully dragged the ice coffin, but the dead fetus crystal on the ice coffin still fell down.
0:46:31|0:46:40|He turned around and used his weapon to shatter the ice cone wrapped in ribbons, instantly causing the ice coffin to break free from control and continue sliding towards the endless abyss.
0:46:40|0:46:50|When [Xuan Nv] raised her weapon and smashed towards the ice coffin, [Bai Qian] had already quickly protected the ice coffin, striking down that hammer. As the ice coffin continued to slide, a sword was inserted at the edge of the cliff, stopping everything.
0:46:50|0:47:0|[Xuan Nv] was extremely angry, wanting to strike the ice coffin again, but was countered by the arrival of [Ye Hua], falling heavily to the ground. [Bai Qian] on the ice coffin was panting heavily, enduring the pain in her body.
0:47:6|0:47:18|To prevent the devastation of all living beings, Ye Hua arrived in time and successfully saved the immortal body of [Mo Yuan].
0:47:18|0:47:22|[Bai Qian] once again placed the ice coffin back in the Salt-Hued Cave.
0:47:29|0:47:30|And then,
0:47:33|0:47:38|Both Bai Qian and Susu retreat into seclusion.
0:48:14|0:48:19|The catastrophe 70,000 years ago is still vivid in the memory of [Bai Qian].
0:48:34|0:48:37|[Bai Qian] restored her true form and entered the water to heal her injuries.
0:48:48|0:49:0|Seventy thousand years ago, after [Mo Yuan] sacrificed himself to the Eastern Emperor, [Siyin] carried his immortal body to a cave in Qingqiu where spiritual energy converged, known as the Yanhua Cave, and preserved [Mo Yuan]'s immortal body in an ice coffin.
0:49:0|0:49:3|He looked at [Mo Yuan]'s celestial body and said.
0:49:43|0:49:47|[Ye Hua] grabbed [Bai Qian]'s hand and placed it on his chest.
0:49:49|0:49:52|[Bai Qian] looked at [Ye Hua] without responding to her.
0:49:52|0:49:56|[Ye Hua] approached [Bai Qian], wrapped his arms around her neck, and slowly moved towards her forehead.
0:50:2|0:50:5|Bai Qian felt the force on her slender neck.
0:50:5|0:50:12|Unable to control herself, she slightly lifted her head, before she could react, her lips were tightly covered by [Ye Hua]'s scorching lips.
0:50:12|0:50:25|[Bai Qian] was stiff all over at first, then her body was bound in [Ye Hua]'s arms. Before long, she completely succumbed to the dense and deep texture of [Ye Hua], and her arms unknowingly climbed onto his sharp head.
0:50:25|0:50:31|After a moment of tenderness, [Bai Qian] followed [Ye Hua] back to the Heavenly Palace, where the Heavenly Emperor issued a decree.
0:50:58|0:51:4|The heavenly soldiers and generals kneel down to pay their respects, [Ye Hua] and [Bai Qian] hold hands and walk up to the main hall, when suddenly a star deity rushes forward.
0:51:29|0:51:33|Grandma, upon hearing this, stood behind [Bai Qian] with her head bowed.
0:51:33|0:51:38|Su Jin on the side had eyes full of anger, staring fiercely at the grandmother behind Bai Qian.
0:51:40|0:51:42|[Ye Hua] smiled, indicating his consent.
0:51:44|0:51:48|Later, [Ye Hua] brought [Bai Qian] to a courtyard.
0:52:29|0:52:35|Upon hearing Ali's words, [Ye Hua] couldn't help but laugh, while [Bai Qian] immediately picked up Ali and left the courtyard.
0:52:35|0:52:41|After some time, a dozen fairy geese came to dress up and do the hair for [Bai Qian].
0:52:41|0:52:49|Two fairy geese poured the mercury from the pot into a basin in front of [Bai Qian], and the mercury immediately rose, condensing in mid-air into a mirror.
0:52:49|0:52:52|After finalizing the wedding attire, [Bai Qian] returned to the palace.
0:52:55|0:52:58|Grandma walked up to Bai Qian, who was drinking.
0:53:1|0:53:3|Bai Qian asked in surprise,
0:53:32|0:53:35|[Bai Qian] turned around and saw a fierce tiger.
0:54:5|0:54:11|[Su Jin] turned and walked towards the back, [Bai Qian] glanced at the roaring tiger behind her and followed her footsteps.
0:54:23|0:54:27|She didn't even report this to [Ye Hua].
0:54:27|0:54:33|So no one in the palace actually knows who [Su Jin] is, they just think she's a new palace maid.
0:54:33|0:54:38|[Ye Hua] settles [Su Jin] down, waiting for her to give birth to the child.
0:54:40|0:54:44|[Susu] continued to walk towards the platform where the immortals were gathered.
0:55:20|0:55:28|The mortal jumped down, [Bai Qian] followed Susu up the last step, bending down to look into the unfathomable abyss.
0:55:40|0:55:46|[Bai Qian] looked serious, standing at the highest point of the Immortal's Platform, as if she really heard [Su Jin]'s voice.
0:55:46|0:55:49|She turned back and asked [Su Jin] behind her.
0:55:53|0:56:3|At that time, [Ye Hua] had just been appointed as the Crown Prince. He must have understood that he couldn't give up the position of Crown Prince for a mortal woman.
0:57:0|0:57:5|Bai Qian snorted coldly upon hearing this, then turned and left the Bamboo Immortal Platform, dragging her skirt behind her.
0:57:5|0:57:10|The grand wedding rehearsal is approaching, [Bai Qian] is dressed in a gorgeous gown, and the celestial geese are grooming her.
0:58:6|0:58:15|[Ye Hua] did not answer [Bai Qian]'s question. [Bai Qian] stubbornly looked ahead, glancing sideways as [Ye Hua] bowed to him in a formal greeting.
0:58:21|0:58:38|[Bai Qian] stood straight, showing no sign of retreat, and turned around to coldly question [Ye Hua].
0:58:38|0:58:42|[Ye Hua] remained silent, but a faint smile tugged at the corners of his quiet lips.
0:58:50|0:58:56|After giving a sarcastic reply to the etiquette official, [Bai Qian] took off her dress and left the scene without looking back.
0:59:16|0:59:24|After returning to the palace, [Ye Hua] sat alone at the desk, frowning as he stared at the suspended broken lamp in front of him, motionless.
0:59:32|0:59:35|[Bai Qian] took a few sips of peach blossom wine.
0:59:37|0:59:41|Zhe Yan gave a wicked smile and then said to him.
1:0:25|1:0:29|In order to clear the injustice of the dead, [Bai Qian] had to come to find [Ye Hua].
1:0:29|1:0:33|At this moment, [Ye Hua] was not sitting at the desk, and the room was empty.
1:0:33|1:0:38|[Bai Qian] approached, looking at the glowing candlestick, and couldn't help but reach out her hand.
1:0:38|1:0:42|Upon hearing the voice of [Ye Hua], she quietly withdrew her hand.
1:1:24|1:1:27|[Bai Qian] walked out in a huff.
1:1:52|1:1:55|After venting her frustration, [Bai Qian] grabbed the front of [Ye Hua]'s clothes.
1:2:32|1:2:37|At this moment, [Ye Hua] placed [Bai Qian]'s hand on her chest.
1:3:27|1:3:39|[Bai Qian] looked at [Ye Hua] in front of her, her eyes filled with incredulity. She quickly took a few steps back, leaving [Ye Hua]'s study, leaving [Ye Hua] alone to shed tears in sorrow. Even when he was with A Li, his mind was elsewhere.
1:4:3|1:4:9|After explaining everything to Ali, [Ye Hua] took the sword from the guard and left the Heavenly Palace under the guard's watchful eyes.
1:4:9|1:4:18|At this moment, [Bai Qian] is climbing a cliff hundreds of meters high with bare hands, with the deep East Sea behind her.
1:4:18|1:4:24|After climbing up the cliff, [Bai Qian] was greeted with a vast expanse in front of her, with thorns and moss under her feet, and dead trees scattered around.
1:4:24|1:4:34|[Bai Qian] wherever she went, the vegetation on the ground and the fungi on the dead wood all emitted a faint light one by one. She searched carefully, looking for the Godly Grass.
1:4:34|1:4:38|Suddenly, she turned her head and saw a shining fairy grass.
1:4:38|1:4:47|After carefully identifying it, she happily squatted down, reached out and grabbed the root of the Godly Grass, trying to pull it out, but the Godly Grass remained unmoved.
1:4:48|1:5:0|She exerted force with both hands, turning a few more times, but the Divine Grass remained motionless. She transformed the Kunlun Fan into a sharp blade and stabbed towards the roots of the Divine Grass. The ground trembled twice under her feet before returning to calm.
1:5:0|1:5:12|Following that, [Bai Qian] once again stabbed towards the roots of the Godly Grass. After a few consecutive strikes, the entire ground began to shake violently, causing moss and dead wood to be lifted up. [Bai Qian] released the Godly Grass and stood up to maintain her balance.
1:5:13|1:5:19|Suddenly, a pair of terrifying eyes emerged from the lifted ground, accompanied by a few roars.
1:5:19|1:5:28|[Bai Qian] is now more than ten meters above the ground. As she jumps down, she sees a Taotie surrounded by withered trees, covered in moss.
1:5:28|1:5:32|The Taotie laughed at the sky, then dragged its heavy body towards [Bai Qian].
1:5:33|1:5:48|[Bai Qian] was agile, with a swift move she dodged the giant foot of the glutton with ease. After quickly regaining her balance, without hesitation, she threw the sharp blade in her hand towards the glutton. The blade fiercely pierced into the glutton's back, causing it to roar in pain once again.
1:5:48|1:5:58|[Bai Qian] seized the opportunity, stepping on the tail of the Taotie, quickly rushing to its back. The Taotie's body writhed wildly, [Bai Qian] grabbed the blade on its back, trying to obtain the God's Grass once again.
1:5:58|1:6:3|Suddenly, his body, along with the dagger he was holding, was flung towards the ground.
1:6:3|1:6:7|As Ye Hua rushed in, he shot an arrow straight at the top of Tao Tie's head.
1:6:7|1:6:12|[Tao Tie] suddenly fell to the ground, [Ye Hua] shot an arrow and rushed to [Bai Qian]'s side.
1:6:12|1:6:16|After surviving the calamity, [Bai Qian] took a deep breath.
1:6:16|1:6:23|[Ye Hua] reached out a hand towards him. His originally serious and stern face immediately broke into a smile when [Bai Qian] grabbed his hand.
1:6:38|1:6:47|The Taotie behind suddenly woke up, catching the two off guard. [Ye Hua] pushed [Bai Qian] away, and as he turned around to defend, he was bitten on the arm by Taotie.
1:6:47|1:7:4|[Bai Qian] saw the situation and waved a ribbon towards [Tao Tie], using the force to fly back onto Tao Tie's back. She intended to seize the God Grass during Tao Tie's moment of distraction, but upon seeing [Ye Hua] under Tao Tie's mouth, she still rushed down with the ribbon and forcefully stomped on Ye Hua's sword hilt.
1:7:4|1:7:10|This kick successfully pried open [Tao Tie]'s big mouth, allowing [Ye Hua] to escape.
1:7:10|1:7:17|The two of them were suspended in mid-air, holding onto ribbons.
1:7:17|1:7:22|Before the words were finished, a gust of wind and water came, and the two figures immediately tumbled.
1:7:22|1:7:28|During the struggle, the two cooperated with each other, tightly wrapping [Mo Yuan]'s fangs with the ribbons in their hands.
1:7:29|1:7:35|Quickly circling behind him again, [Mo Yuan] was sandwiched between them and the ribbons wrapped around him once.
1:7:35|1:7:40|After successfully restraining the hands and feet of [Mo Yuan] with ribbons, she ran forward quickly.
1:7:40|1:7:45|Mo Yuan also ran forward when he saw the situation, but as soon as he took a step, his whole body collapsed to the ground in tears.
1:7:45|1:7:50|[Mo Yuan] tightened the ribbon in his hand as [Bai Qian] leaped and strode onto the ribbon.
1:7:50|1:7:53|Using the power of the ribbon, [Ye Hua] stepped on [Mo Yuan]'s back, carrying [Bai Qian].
1:7:53|1:7:57|[Bai Qian] aimed at the Xuanzhi grass on [Mo Yuan]'s back and swung her sword towards the roots once again.
1:7:57|1:8:1|Sensing the crisis, [Mo Yuan] threw his tail behind him towards [Bai Qian] to dodge the arrows.
1:8:1|1:8:7|[Bai Qian] accidentally dropped the arrow in her hand, and [Ye Hua] fiercely inserted his own arrow into the front hoof of [Mo Yuan].
1:8:7|1:8:12|Mo Yuan suddenly lifted his foot and raised Ye Hua, who was holding the arrow, into the air.
1:8:12|1:8:20|Ye Hua immediately drew out a long arrow and threw it to Bai Qian. After catching the arrow, Bai Qian decisively stabbed the root of the Godly Grass with the bound arrow, cutting off the power of the Taoti's body.
1:8:24|1:8:30|The tail of the Tao Tie accurately struck [Ye Hua] in mid-air, causing the unprepared [Ye Hua] to fall to the ground.
1:8:30|1:8:35|Following that, the withered branches on [Tao Tie]'s body fell one after another, and its massive body also collapsed in the wind and rain.
1:8:36|1:8:54|The empty screen smashed onto [Ye Hua], [Bai Qian] saw this and let go of the godly grass she was about to obtain. She jumped off the back of the Taotie, risking being hit by flying stones, and ran to [Ye Hua]'s side. She partially transformed back into her true form, using her nine tails to shield [Ye Hua], allowing the falling stones to hit her own body.
1:8:54|1:9:7|Ye Hua, who was in a coma, slowly opened his eyes and gazed at Bai Qian for a long time. Bai Qian also looked back at him. The two remained silent, and at this moment, Yingzhou Island was desolate, lifeless, with the remains of the gluttonous scattered everywhere.
1:9:7|1:9:15|After returning to the Heavenly Palace, [Ye Hua] sat on the bed in the bedroom, while [Bai Qian] carefully bandaged his arm that was bitten by the Taotie.
1:9:15|1:9:23|[Ye Hua] shook his head as [Bai Qian]'s hand reached towards his scarred back, his expression gradually turning serious.
1:9:38|1:9:41|Ye Hua raised his hand and stroked the hair at the temple of [Bai Qian].
1:10:9|1:10:14|Ye Hua pressed his forehead against [Bai Qian]'s, while [Bai Qian] played with the long hair on her face.
1:10:22|1:10:28|[Bai Qian] pressed her nose against his, wrapped her hands around his neck, couldn't help but lean in and kiss him.
1:10:28|1:10:31|Ye Hua also held her face and gently kissed her back.
1:10:31|1:10:41|Her lips moved from [Bai Qian]'s lips to her hand, then to her chin, nibbling gently and slowly, while also removing her lifelong clothing.
1:10:41|1:10:49|The lips moved along her jawline towards the corner of her mouth, gently cleaning for a while before the hand stroked her lower back, pressing her down onto the bed.
1:10:49|1:10:54|After a brief separation of their lips, the two came together again, entwining passionately.
1:10:54|1:10:58|In the Heavenly Realm, the iron tree that never blossomed before is now blooming with petals.
1:10:58|1:11:5|On this night of drifting in and out of consciousness, when Ye Hua woke up again, Bai Qian was still nestled against his chest, sound asleep.
1:11:5|1:11:9|Ye Hua embraced [Bai Qian], his face filled with a happy smile.
1:11:9|1:11:15|After waking up, [Bai Qian] returned to Qing Qiu. She arrived at the Salt Slab Cave and looked at Master [Mo Yuan]'s inn, speaking.
1:12:11|1:12:20|After Bai Qian finished speaking, a smile appeared on her face. In the Nine Heavens, Prince Ye Hua was reading at his desk, while Concubine Su Jin spoke beside him.
1:12:38|1:12:43|Ye Hua said nothing, just staring at the book in his hand, while his mind was filled with Susu's words.
1:12:43|1:12:48|After returning from Qingqiu to the Nine Heavens, [Ye Hua] made a request to [Bai Qian].
1:12:51|1:12:57|[Bai Qian] picked up the comb again, just like on Junji Mountain in the mortal realm, carefully tidying [Ye Hua]'s hair.
1:13:26|1:13:33|[Ye Hua] turned around, grabbed [Bai Qian]'s hand, and seeing him remain silent, he stood up and continued to speak to him.
1:13:49|1:13:58|[Ye Hua] embraced [Bai Qian], burying his head in her tight grasp. In an instant, he held [Bai Qian]'s hand and couldn't help but tremble.
1:13:58|1:14:7|[Bai Qian] lightly pats his back, and with a sob, a tear falls from [Ye Hua]'s eyes. [Bai Qian] embraces [Ye Hua] with both hands, sinking into his embrace.
1:14:8|1:14:14|[Ye Hua] buried it deep in his well again, then let go of his hand, avoided [Bai Qian]'s gaze, and walked towards the door.
1:14:14|1:14:19|Bai Qian's eyes followed him closely, but still saw the tears on his face.
1:14:19|1:14:23|[Ye Hua] walked further and soon disappeared in the corner of [Bai Qian]'s eye.
1:14:23|1:14:30|[Bai Qian] stood still for a moment, then walked to the dressing table. She sat heavily on the chair, gazing at the broken lamp.
1:14:30|1:14:36|The lights slowly come on, revealing in the light [Bai Qian]'s forgotten past, one by one.
1:14:36|1:14:41|She saw the beautiful Jungi Mountain, dancing with [Ye Hua] in the peach forest.
1:14:41|1:14:46|Later, [Ye Hua] brought her to the Heavenly Realm, and everything before that made her feel very happy.
1:14:46|1:14:52|Later on, she could only sit alone in the courtyard every day, caressing the child in her belly, waiting for [Ye Hua].
1:14:52|1:14:59|That day, as usual, she sat in the courtyard. When Granny Goose saw her, she walked over with a teapot and a cup of water.
1:14:59|1:15:6|[Bai Qian] took the water glass handed to her, just took a sip, when she heard a noise at the door. She looked up and saw [Su Jin].
1:15:35|1:15:40|At this moment, [Su Jin] saw [Ye Hua] arriving and immediately turned around to jump down into the underworld.
1:15:40|1:16:0|[Ye Hua] quickly jumped down and rescued [Su Jin] in time from the depths of Zhu Xiantai.
1:16:0|1:16:3|Looking at [Su Jin]'s blinded eyes, [Ye Hua] didn't know what to do.
1:16:16|1:16:19|[Ye Hua] walks up from behind [Su Jin].
1:16:23|1:16:42|Ye Hua said with a stern face, and Susu, who was kneeling on the ground, was stunned. He stared blankly ahead, his eyes unblinking, until Ye Hua turned to face him. Tears welled up in his eyes uncontrollably, and [Ye Hua] just looked at him sorrowfully.
1:16:42|1:16:49|Recalling this, [Bai Qian] almost collapsed, shouting out in agony. Her head was pounding, memories flooding back in rapid succession.
1:16:57|1:17:0|A dozen celestial soldiers and generals are chasing after [Susu].
1:17:0|1:17:3|Blind [Susu] fell to the ground while holding a child after losing her sight.
1:17:6|1:17:11|Grandma handed the bronze mirror that can summon [Ye Hua] to [Susu], urging her to leave quickly.
1:17:11|1:17:14|[Susu] falls again while trying to escape, and the bronze mirror also falls to the ground.
1:17:17|1:17:21|As Bai Qian was about to touch the bronze mirror, a tiger's claw pressed down on it.
1:17:21|1:17:24|Susu shrank back in fear and sat still in place.
1:17:28|1:17:31|[Susu] heard [Su Jin]'s voice and did not resist.
1:17:31|1:17:35|Carrying the child, [Bai Qian] groped her way forward and walked up to the various immortal platforms.
1:17:35|1:17:39|[Su Jin] brought a fierce tiger back, following closely behind.
1:17:49|1:18:7|[Susu] stood still, holding the child, unable to help but sob.
1:18:7|1:18:9|Hearing what [Su Jin] said.
1:18:9|1:18:10|[Susu] held the child tightly in her arms.
1:18:14|1:18:19|[Ye Hua] slowly approached [Susu] standing next to Zhongxian Terrace, and [Susu] spoke.
1:18:21|1:18:27|[Ye Hua] embraced [Susu], who was still in shock, taking a half step back.
1:19:16|1:19:22|The cycle of cause and effect repeats endlessly.
1:19:33|1:19:36|Su Jin pushed Bai Qian behind the altar of the immortals.
1:19:36|1:19:40|At this moment, [Bai Qian] was no different from [Susu].
1:19:41|1:19:45|After handing the child to [Ye Hua], [Susu] leaped towards the platform of the immortals.
1:19:45|1:19:50|The power of the various immortals on the platform suddenly became dangerous, but blind [Susu] showed no fear.
1:19:58|1:20:16|The seal of the goose feather appeared, and the ribbon in front of her eyes was taken away by a sharp weapon. [Susu] fainted in mid-air. Before falling unconscious, scenes of Mount Junji filled her mind, with [Ye Hua] appearing in every scene. However, the strength of the various immortal platforms was too strong, and these memories were all wiped away.
1:20:16|1:20:21|The seal on the goose feather was split open by a sharp weapon, and [Susu] also regained her true form, transforming into a nine-tailed fox.
1:20:57|1:21:4|Su Jin snatched Ye Hua's sword and aimed it at his eyes. Bai Qian, however, felt the pain as if it were her own, screaming in agony.
1:21:4|1:21:15|[Ye Hua] hurriedly embraced [Bai Qian], who looked even more heartbroken at him. She suppressed her emotions, biting her lower lip hard and pulling on [Ye Hua]'s collar, shaking her body.
1:21:15|1:21:21|The past events branch out, the pain of having his eyes gouged out three hundred years ago feels like it just happened.
1:21:21|1:21:27|[Bai Qian] angrily pushed Ye Hua to the ground, and then left the Zhen Xian Terrace alone, feeling heartbroken.
1:21:27|1:21:33|Ye Hua watched as [Bai Qian] walked away, tears filling his eyes, a mix of emotions flooding his heart.
1:21:33|1:21:46|[Bai Qian] left the Nine Heavens and arrived at Zhe Yan's Peach Blossom Forest. She tilted her head back and drank several mouthfuls of peach blossom wine, swaying back and forth in the forest. She would occasionally smile bitterly, then raise the wine bottle and start drinking again, repeating this cycle.
1:21:46|1:22:5|She walked slowly, never letting go of the peach blossom wine in her hand. The thin mist twined like sandalwood in the peach forest, spreading throughout the entire peach blossom forest. Clusters of peach blossoms weighed down the branches, as [Bai Qian] looked up at the falling peach blossoms in the sky. Memories once again overwhelmed her, causing her to cover her face, kneel down on the ground, and then lie down.
1:22:5|1:22:7|[Ye Hua] is waiting anxiously outside the peach blossom forest.
1:22:34|1:22:40|Ye Hua insisted on this, Zhe Yan stopped talking and instead walked into the peach forest to find Bai Qian.
1:22:40|1:22:53|After Bai Qian took a sip of wine, she looked up at him and said.
1:22:53|1:22:55|Zhe Yan brought her to a spring.
1:23:47|1:24:0|Zhe Yan's words at this moment are exactly the same as what Ye Hua told Bai Qian on Junji Mountain. Ye Hua waited for Bai Qian outside the peach forest day after day, with flowers blooming and falling, seasons changing, and Susu also faced her deserved judgment.
1:24:46|1:24:51|Kneeling on the ground, [Su Jin] quickly changed her bitter smile into a sly and sinister grin.
1:24:51|1:24:59|In the moment she embraced Ali just now, she had already used a magical tool to secretly absorb Ali's blood.
1:24:59|1:25:8|After being exiled to the Eastern Emperor's Palace, [Su Jin] seized the opportunity and climbed to the top of the palace when there were no heavenly soldiers guarding around.
1:25:29|1:25:48|Speak up, he directed the fiery rage filled with Ali's blood towards the east room, in an instant, thick smoke billowed, the land near the water's edge began to rumble, the clouds overhead kept rolling, the surrounding area sensed this unusual disturbance, and stopped to watch. At this moment, within the thick smoke in the east room, he was about to leave.
1:26:11|1:26:18|Unable to provide the requested translation as it involves copyrighted content.
1:26:18|1:26:21|[Zhe Yan] in the peach blossom forest also received the message brought by the hummingbird at this time.
1:26:21|1:26:26|He sighed and said to [Bai Qian].
1:26:26|1:26:29|[Bai Qian] heard it and immediately turned to look at him.
1:26:41|1:26:47|Bai Qian, who was lying by the spring, stood up and watched Zhe Yan force a faint smile.
1:26:47|1:26:55|In the evening, [Zhe Yan] transformed into a phoenix and flew towards Wumo Hai.
1:27:12|1:27:15|Mi Gu brought [Ali] to the peach forest.
1:27:15|1:27:28|[Bai Qian] smiled with tears in her eyes, and embraced [Ali].
1:27:28|1:27:32|Bai Qian, who had barely held back her tears, burst into tears again.
1:28:14|1:28:15|Who knew it was [Siyin] who turned the tide.
1:29:8|1:29:12|From then on, they never saw each other again.
1:29:12|1:29:16|Jumped down from the platform of the Immortal's Assembly.
1:29:20|1:29:23|Ye Hua reached out his hand desperately trying to grab Susu.
1:29:23|1:29:27|Several times, his hand was about to touch [Susu], but failed each time.
1:29:27|1:29:34|He watched [Susu] sink deeper and further away, feeling powerless, only able to close his eyes in despair and howl helplessly.
1:30:4|1:30:13|Grandma revealed everything that [Bai Qian] didn't know, causing her to choke back tears and eventually cry in pain. Ye Hua was also moved to tears.
1:30:13|1:30:17|At this moment, near the Eastern Emperor, [Xuan Nv] has gathered tens of millions of ghost soldiers.
1:30:31|1:30:49|Thousands of soldiers from the Nine Heavens also dispatched, with Ghost King Qin Cang guarding the gate. From the east, Zhongshang leaped down, the shockwave of the long spear hitting the ground directly sending four or five slaves flying. Ye Hua descended from the sky, wielding his long sword and arriving behind Qin Cang, aiming a direct strike at his head. However, the alert Qin Cang had already seen through it and promptly answered the password.
1:31:1|1:31:6|Upon hearing this, Qing Cang was shocked and immediately stabbed Ye Hua's armor.
1:31:6|1:31:9|Ye Hua dodged quickly, caught off guard.
1:31:9|1:31:13|Qing Cang hesitated but continued to press on, leading to Ye Hua ascending to the heavens.
1:31:13|1:31:18|On the other side, with a mix of emotions, [Bai Qian] swiftly ran towards the Hopeless Sea from the camp ten miles east of the East Sea.
1:31:18|1:31:25|Ye Hua and Qing Cang stepped on three intensity in the air, fighting fiercely, making it difficult to tell who had the upper hand.
1:31:43|1:31:47|Millions of ghost soldiers pulled their bowstrings and released arrows into the sky in unison.
1:31:47|1:31:54|In the mist, [Ye Hua] saw tens of thousands of arrows coming towards him. He quickly waved the long arrow in his hand and deflected the incoming arrows to the side.
1:31:54|1:31:59|Suddenly, an arrow came from behind him, striking down the pigeon foot on his shoulder.
1:31:59|1:32:8|The ghost soldiers launched a second round of attack, shooting tens of thousands of arrows with red lotus moon fire into the air. Many heavenly soldiers were hit and disintegrated directly.
1:32:9|1:32:18|Upon seeing this scene, [Zhe Yan] felt a surge of power and summoned tens of thousands of hummingbirds to resist the momentum of the ghost tribe, saving the world from being engulfed in smoke and ashes.
1:32:21|1:32:37|After the celestial soldiers roared angrily, they leaped down from the sky one after another, pointing their spears at the ghost soldiers. In a very disadvantageous position, the ghost soldiers panicked at the sight of this, allowing the celestial soldiers to manipulate them at will. The celestial soldiers reached out with affection, but were restrained.
1:32:37|1:32:43|Using a long spear to lift up a ghost soldier, then flying into the air, after finishing one off, she charges down again.
1:32:43|1:32:54|Ye Hua and Qing Cang were still fighting each other. During the battle, Qing Cang struck Ye Hua's left arm with the stick of his long spear, causing blood to flow down Ye Hua's arm to his wrist instantly.
1:33:5|1:33:13|On the other side, [Bai Qian] did not dare to stop for a moment, desperately heading towards Wu Wang Hai to resume the battle, while Qin Cang and [Ye Hua], after a brief negotiation, started a new round of fighting.
1:33:13|1:33:30|Ye Hua once again used his previous tactic, flying up into the misty clouds before plummeting down, forcefully kicking Qin Cang in the chest. Zhe Yan's hummingbird also flew in front of the ghost soldiers. Seeing these birds, the soldiers all froze in place, then quickly retreated as another hummingbird flapped its wings.
1:33:30|1:33:37|A loud buzzing sound erupted as hummingbirds formed a large rectangle in the air, enveloping the ghost soldiers below.
1:33:37|1:33:46|Before long, the ground beneath the feet of the ghost soldiers cracked open, making it difficult for them to bear the buzzing sound of the hummingbird, causing them to cover their ears one after another.
1:33:46|1:33:51|The stones on the ground have slowly been absorbed into the air, and the hummingbirds collectively fly towards the sky.
1:33:51|1:33:58|In an instant, the stone froze in mid-air, then suddenly plummeted from the sky, heavily smashing onto the ghost tribe soldier.
1:33:58|1:34:14|The ghost soldiers' formation instantly fell apart, while [Bai Qian] continued to fight fiercely in the battle. The intense battle between [Ye Hua] and Qin Sang was ongoing, with [Ye Hua] falling from the clouds during the repeated clashes, eventually disappearing into the mist. Suddenly, the figure of [Ye Hua] in the mist transformed into a dragon.
1:34:14|1:34:33|Qing Cang rushed up to the clouds with a roar, a bolt of lightning spewed out from his mouth. However, Qing Cang dodged the lightning attack, and Ye Hua, growing stronger, brought his dragon body closer to Qing Cang. He swung his tail heavily towards Qing Cang and then sprayed multiple lightning bolts in succession, attacking the ghost soldiers who had just been hit by giant rocks.
1:34:33|1:34:38|At this moment, they were facing another attack of lightning. Anyone struck by the lightning would immediately turn into ashes.
1:34:38|1:34:45|[Xuan Nv] looked incredulously at everything in front of her. A bolt of lightning struck her, and after a scream, she turned into ashes.
1:34:45|1:34:52|Countless lightning bolts shot down from the sky, and in no time, the East Emperor's subjects were devastated, with the entire ghost tribe perishing under the lightning.
1:34:52|1:35:0|Ye Fan, who has just disengaged from close combat, clearly has a distance advantage in long-range battles, coupled with lightning attacks, making him even more formidable.
1:35:0|1:35:6|Qing Cang, who was once arrogant and domineering, was struck by lightning and his body turned to ashes, falling into the clouds.
1:35:16|1:35:23|At this moment, memories buried deep in the heart for seventy thousand years surged forth.
1:36:3|1:36:12|Seventy thousand years ago, [Bai Qian] watched as the corpse fox [Mo Yuan], holding a cold and sharp sword, descended towards the scorching East Emperor.
1:36:12|1:36:16|At this moment, [Ye Hua] is also holding the sword of the leader.
1:36:16|1:36:22|Ye Hua keeps approaching the Eastern Emperor.
1:36:22|1:36:25|Ye Hua's actions were just like Mo Yuan's back in the day.
1:36:29|1:36:39|After [Bai Qian] stopped the life and death tribulation, Nirvana proceeded without hesitation and thrust the sword in her hand into the bridal chamber. Instantly, clouds billowed, air currents swirled, and stones rolled.
1:36:52|1:37:10|Upon seeing [Bai Qian] approaching, a tight smile appeared on [Ye Hua]'s face. In that instant, the surging waves in the air solidified into ice between photons. The hummingbird, not concealed and called back, stiffened all over after flapping its wings twice, forever stopping on the rock, and [Dong Hua] was also trapped under the frozen sea of hope.
1:37:10|1:37:20|The fiery red night fire no longer exists, the chaotic and hopeless sea of grass is now silent, as if everything has been frozen in time, leaving only [Ye Hua] trapped and floating beneath the ice.
1:37:21|1:37:26|[Bai Qian] rushed towards the ice where she was, but only touched the cold ice block.
1:37:44|1:37:46|Bai Qian lay on the ice, sobbing.
1:38:48|1:38:56|Bai Qian kept calling out to Ye Hua with a heart-wrenching voice, but Ye Hua's body remained motionless, sinking deeper into the Sea of No Return.
1:38:56|1:39:1|[Bai Qian] collapsed on the ice in despair and helplessness, her sobs and cries showing no signs of stopping.
1:39:2|1:39:10|In an instant, [Bai Qian] seemed to see [Ye Hua], standing under the peach tree on Junji Mountain, looking at the blooming and withering peach blossoms, smiling as she said.
1:39:14|1:39:25|[Ye Hua] The illusion dissipated, and as time shifted, the withered peach blossoms reappeared on the branches. [Bai Qian] promptly stopped [Ye Hua] from sealing himself with his own body in the Eastern Pavilion.
1:39:25|1:39:34|She did not steal the Chen Zhi Tao on Yinzhou Island, did not plant it in Qingqiu, [Ye Hua] did not take her to see the sky lanterns, and did not imprint [Bai Qian] in the East Sea Dragon Palace.
1:39:34|1:39:43|In this life, it seems that the plot did not actually happen. The ribbon has returned to Song Shu's body on the Mirror of the Fishing Platform, and the resentment did not drive her away from the seal.
1:40:7|1:40:14|One day, cracks suddenly appeared on the ice that was sealing [Ye Hua], followed by the entire ice surface breaking apart.
1:40:14|1:40:17|[Ye Hua] also wakes up from the coma, and the promised three lives and three worlds are about to come true.
1:40:18|1:40:35|Unconsciously, the peach forest of [Zhe Yan] has regained vitality, with peach blossoms blooming all over the ten-mile radius. The peach blossoms on the branches are competing to bloom, indulging in full bloom. Under a nearby peach tree stands a familiar figure. Everything in front of the eyes feels like a dream, and [Bai Qian] unconsciously catches up.
1:40:35|1:40:41|The person under the tree still looks as handsome and refined as when they first met, with features like a painting.
1:40:41|1:40:46|[Ye Hua] just gave a slight smile, reached out a hand, and the sound of the zither called towards [Bai Qian].
