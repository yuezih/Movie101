0:2:42|0:2:52|The scene shifts to a crowded train station, where the time and location keep changing on the signboard. The sound of footsteps from leather shoes and high heels echoes on the floor.
0:2:54|0:2:58|Everyone hurriedly walked towards their destinations.
0:2:58|0:3:7|The only girl with bangs and long hair sat quietly in the waiting area, holding a train ticket from Taipei to Chiayi.
0:3:7|0:3:15|At 18:42, time slowly passed and froze. In the crowded train station a second ago, suddenly there was no one.
0:3:16|0:3:31|In the quiet surroundings, the little girl looked up, and unexpectedly, it started snowing heavily inside the train station. The falling snowflakes were like goose feathers, like willow catkins, slowly drifting down. Before long, the heavy snow covered the entire floor of the station, the screens, and the seats.
0:3:33|0:3:40|Thick snow covered everything, wrapping the train station in a way that made people feel like they were in a fairy tale world.
0:3:40|0:3:46|The little girl looked up at the magnificent six-petal flower, as clear as smoke and as lustrous as jade.
0:3:46|0:3:50|Fluttering, spinning, drifting, finally landing on her own delicate cheek.
0:4:30|0:4:37|The dimly lit corridor is lined with valuable landscape paintings, and at the end of the corridor, a door slowly opens.
0:4:37|0:4:43|The little girl walked into the renovated ancient house, where the people inside were speaking fluent English and promoting modernization.
0:4:53|0:4:59|The little girl looked through the glass at the people inside the house, feeling like she had a lot to say but not knowing how to speak up.
0:4:59|0:5:5|At night, inside a rural cottage, [Xie Xinmei's Grandfather] is holding a wooden hammer and nails, making handicrafts.
0:5:5|0:5:9|Suddenly, a rapid phone ringing is heard.
0:5:14|0:5:19|The girl Xiaomei didn't know how to approach [Xie Xinmei's Grandfather], who immediately saw through her thoughts.
0:5:58|0:6:8|On Christmas Day, [Xie Xinmei's Dad] was busy cooking, while [Xie Xinmei's Mom] sat at the dining table, drinking red wine and scrolling through her phone, looking very happy.
0:6:18|0:6:28|At this moment, [Xie Xinmei's Dad] walked over with a tray of delicious dishes.
0:6:28|0:6:33|On this joyful day, the family of three appeared particularly distant.
0:7:11|0:7:21|[Xie Xinmei's Mom] was on the phone nearby. Although Xiaomei couldn't understand the conversation, she could tell from Xie Xinmei's mom's anxious expression that things were not as simple as they seemed.
0:7:21|0:7:24|Xie Xinmei's Mom's angry expression stunned Xiaomei, only to be interrupted by Xie Xinmei's Dad the next second.
0:7:27|0:7:31|[Xie Xinmei's Mom] angrily hung up the phone and walked towards the house in silence.
0:7:31|0:7:37|[Xie Xinmei's Dad] also put down his chopsticks upon seeing this, took off his Santa hat, and walked into the room with [Xie Xinmei's Mom].
0:7:37|0:7:39|At the dining table, only Xie Xinmei remained.
0:7:39|0:7:47|Xie Xinmei slowly walked towards the door and overheard her parents' conversation.
0:7:59|0:8:20|The parents' argument gradually became distorted, and [Xie Xinmei] stared at the solo portrait on the wall, gradually becoming entranced as the painting unexpectedly showed a joyful scene of the family looking at paintings together in her childhood.
0:8:20|0:8:22|The calm conversation finally turned into an argument.
0:8:38|0:8:45|[Xie Xinmei] knocked on her parents' door, her father opened it, and she said.
0:8:45|0:8:54|[Xie Xinmei]'s arrival interrupted the argument between the two, making the atmosphere awkward instantly. [Xie Xinmei's Mom] looked at [Xie Xinmei] somewhat at a loss, before she could speak, Dad spoke directly.
0:9:6|0:9:10|After a few perfunctory words, Dad closed the door.
0:9:10|0:9:13|Endless arguments between her parents made [Xie Xinmei] increasingly irritable.
0:9:13|0:9:20|[Xie Xinmei] spent hours putting together and taking apart thousands of puzzle pieces, not knowing how to mend her parents' relationship.
0:9:22|0:9:30|At this moment, faint music could be heard from outside the window. [Xie Xinmei] got up and walked towards the window, opening it.
0:9:30|0:9:36|Downstairs, two rows of believers in matching attire, holding long candles, are praying for Christmas blessings.
0:9:36|0:9:43|Looking up, they unexpectedly saw a little boy playing the flute across the window for them.
0:9:43|0:9:49|The ethereal singing accompanied by melodious music feels particularly heartwarming on this special night.
0:10:12|0:10:15|The scene shifts to the school, and the bell for class slowly rings.
0:10:17|0:10:28|Class 3 of the first year, the students gathered in groups and returned to the classroom. The chattering continued non-stop, and the students in the classroom were in a mess.
0:10:28|0:10:42|[Teacher Yijiao] enters the classroom holding a textbook.
0:10:42|0:10:46|The little boy walked into the classroom with a drawing board in his hand, bowing his head.
0:10:48|0:10:51|The boy was a little at a loss and said softly.
0:11:10|0:11:14|[Xie Xinmei] recognized him as the boy playing the flute at a glance.
0:11:16|0:11:16|Classmates are thinking.
0:11:46|0:11:48|All eyes turned to the back row.
0:11:59|0:12:1|[Xie Xinmei] looked worriedly at Xiaojie leaving.
0:12:8|0:12:11|School is over, and there is a constant stream of people at the alley entrance.
0:12:11|0:12:18|[Xie Xinmei] watched Xiaojie walking ahead as if searching for something, getting ready to strike up a conversation.
0:12:18|0:12:25|Around the corner, Xie Xinmei saw Xiaojie walking towards the bus stop, looking puzzled at the bus stop sign.
0:12:25|0:12:30|[Xie Xinmei] looked at him from a distance, lost in thought, when a classmate appeared behind him and interrupted his reverie.
0:12:45|0:12:52|[Xie Xinmei] quickly turned away from her classmates' invitation and ran towards Xiaojie, boarding the same bus with him.
0:12:52|0:12:56|[Xie Xinmei] sitting in the back row carefully scrutinized Xiaojie standing in front.
0:13:5|0:13:10|This aroused strong curiosity in [Xie Xinmei], and she secretly made up her mind to figure it out.
0:13:11|0:13:22|After getting off the car, the two walked through a quiet alley, passing by a stone wall with a windmill background. [Xie Xinmei] paid no attention to the beautiful scenery along the road, her eyes only on Xiaojie.
0:13:22|0:13:28|Wherever Xiaojie went, [Xie Xinmei] followed, but Xiaojie paid no attention to [Xie Xinmei] who was closely following behind.
0:13:28|0:13:35|At the next intersection, Xiaojie turned and walked towards an underground stationery store. [Xie Xinmei] almost got hit by a passing car trying to catch up with him.
0:13:36|0:13:42|[Xie Xinmei] stood hesitantly in front of the stationery store, carefully observing the store in front of her.
0:13:42|0:13:49|The entrance is very narrow, only allowing one person to pass through, and the wooden decoration gives the stationery store a strong literary atmosphere.
0:13:49|0:13:57|The store, although small, is well-organized with a wide variety of supplies, and there are scattered students selecting stationery.
0:13:57|0:14:3|[Xie Xinmei]'s eyes quickly searched for Xiaojie, and as he turned around, she quickly crouched down, almost being discovered by Xiaojie.
0:14:3|0:14:15|At this moment, she noticed Xiaojie looking around, seemingly choosing stationery, but in fact, his right hand secretly took an eraser and quickly stuffed it into his pocket. He was actually stealing something.
0:14:15|0:14:22|Shocked, [Xie Xinmei] quickly turned back to look at the boss lady, only to find her busy with bookkeeping, completely unaware of Xiaojie's actions.
0:14:22|0:14:28|[Xie Xinmei] was puzzled by the fact that the usually quiet Xiaojie had such an unknown side.
0:14:28|0:14:31|Driven by curiosity, [Xie Xinmei] continued to follow Xiaojie.
0:14:31|0:14:38|To avoid being noticed by Xiaojie, she kept a distance but her eyes never left him.
0:14:38|0:14:44|Seeing Xiaojie skillfully steal the pencils from the second shelf of the display, [Xie Xinmei] went from being shocked at first to finding it amusing.
0:14:50|0:14:56|Xie Xinmei slowly approached the shelves, glanced at the shopkeeper, and then began to imitate Xiaojie's movements.
0:14:56|0:15:4|The next moment, she casually picked up stationery with her right hand, pretending to choose, while her left hand quickly stole the eraser from the second shelf of the display rack and put it in her pocket.
0:15:4|0:15:8|Xie Xinmei, who succeeded, felt secretly delighted and a long-lost smile appeared on her face.
0:15:10|0:15:24|Watching [Xiaojie] circling the shelves again to find the next target, Xie Xinmei found it more and more interesting. She even started stealing with Xiaojie, pencils, colored pens, ballpoint pens, glue, correction fluid.
0:15:24|0:15:29|Xie Xinmei started off cautious and nervous, but gradually became more relaxed.
0:15:30|0:15:38|Whatever [Xiaojie] has stolen, Xinmei will steal it again, as if this can help her understand him better and get closer to him.
0:15:38|0:15:43|Turning around again, [Xiaojie] walked towards the cashier and took out an item to pay.
0:15:43|0:15:48|Xie Xinmei hesitated for a moment, then a relieved smile appeared on her face.
0:15:48|0:15:56|The scene cuts to home, where stolen stationery is neatly arranged on the table. Looking at these stationery items, Xinmei falls into contemplation.
0:15:57|0:16:7|Suddenly, a knocking sound is heard, and Xie Xinmei quickly uses her textbook to block them.
0:16:7|0:16:11|Mom held a beautiful hat, but [Xie Xinmei] glanced at it with no interest at all.
0:16:14|0:16:28|[Xie Xinmei's Mom]'s reaction took her mother by surprise. She helplessly picked up the exquisite hat and walked towards the rack, looking at all the clothes and hats she had carefully selected for her daughter, most of which still had their tags on.
0:16:28|0:16:34|[Xie Xinmei's Mom] turned to look at [Xie Xinmei] doing her homework, feeling a mix of emotions, but could only put the hat back on.
0:16:34|0:16:52|[Xie Xinmei] seemed to have seen through [Xie Xinmei's Mom]'s thoughts, but she held back the words on the tip of her tongue and continued to turn her head to do her homework. During the lunch break, classmates sat in groups chatting and eating together. Several boys were playing and fooling around in the classroom. After finishing his meal, Xiaojie stood up and walked towards the door.
0:16:52|0:16:56|[Xie Xinmei] turned to see Xiaojie leaving, and after a moment of contemplation, she made a silent decision in her heart.
0:16:58|0:17:11|He looked around to make sure no classmates noticed him, then pretended to calmly walk to the back of the classroom to check the content posted on the blackboard, actually wanting to learn about Xiaojie's daily life at school.
0:17:11|0:17:15|Turning his head, he unexpectedly saw Xiaojie's portable drawing board in the drawer.
0:17:17|0:17:24|[Xie Xinmei], with a rush of blood to her head, driven by curiosity, sat at Xiaojie's desk and opened his sketchbook.
0:17:24|0:17:32|Xiaojie's painting surprised [Xie Xinmei], although it was not as lifelike as a master's work, she was still able to sculpt different objects three-dimensionally and vividly.
0:17:33|0:17:41|Whether it's the dull and boring cube or the lively bird, they seem to come to life under her brush.
0:17:41|0:17:47|However, on the next page, [Xie Xinmei] saw that the painting depicted the sleeping face of a naked woman.
0:17:47|0:17:51|Xie Xinmei, shocked, hadn't reacted yet when the male classmate snatched the drawing board away.
0:18:4|0:18:15|Unaware, Xiaojie was walking towards the classroom with his clean lunchbox.
0:18:15|0:18:17|The classmates were all frightened by Xiaojie's roar.
0:18:19|0:18:27|At this moment, Xiaojie, who had finished washing the dishes, threw away the lunchbox and rushed up to confront the male classmate who was causing trouble, but fortunately Teacher Yijiao arrived in time.
0:18:50|0:19:1|After school, feeling guilty, [Xie Xinmei] followed behind Xiaojie. Xiaojie turned around, paused for a second in the hallway, then walked towards the top floor of the teaching building without looking back.
0:19:1|0:19:4|[Xie Xinmei] hurried to catch up, afraid that he might get into trouble.
0:19:9|0:19:12|The strange roar made [Xie Xinmei] feel uneasy.
0:19:12|0:19:20|She walked forward step by step, looked up and saw Xiaojie punching and kicking the big iron barrel, venting his frustration.
0:19:20|0:19:26|[Xie Xinmei] was about to speak, but she saw Xiaojie's shadow turning into a monster under the sunlight.
0:19:26|0:19:34|The sharp slap, coupled with the chilling coldness and the deafening roar, all made [Xie Xinmei] feel scared.
0:19:34|0:19:37|Xiaojie saw [Xie Xinmei] and quickly grabbed his backpack to leave in a hurry.
0:19:46|0:19:50|Xie Xinmei was at a loss when faced with Xiaojie's attitude, standing frozen in place.
0:19:50|0:19:56|In the office, Xiaojie's Mom felt embarrassed and awkward. She couldn't believe that her son would draw such a picture.
0:20:34|0:20:43|Xiaojie nodded obediently, and the homeroom teacher handed the picture book to Xiaojie's Mom. Xiaojie's Mom quickly snatched it with both hands, creating an especially awkward atmosphere.
0:20:43|0:20:51|One day, [Xie Xinmei] returned home from school as usual, with the busy office workers and groups of students still bustling on the street.
0:20:51|0:20:58|As she passed by a small alley, she heard faint cries of distress, and she instinctively felt that something was wrong.
0:21:8|0:21:14|He turned and walked into the alley, where a few troublemaking boys in the class were bullying Xiaojie together.
0:21:14|0:21:19|[Xie Xinmei] gathered up her courage and walked towards them, as the shadow behind her slowly transformed into a towering monster.
0:21:24|0:21:31|[Xie Xinmei], transformed into a bad beast, instantly increased her combat power, not only protecting the young lady but also driving away the male classmate who bullied her.
0:21:40|0:21:43|After a brief conversation, there was another long period of silence.
0:21:43|0:21:48|[Xiaojie's Mom] hurriedly arrived at the hospital and turned to see the injured Xiaojie.
0:21:48|0:21:55|At this moment, the stone hanging in her heart finally dropped. She gently touched Xiaojie's head, with a look of helplessness and heartache in her eyes.
0:21:56|0:21:59|Xie Xinmei on the side, feeling a bit at a loss, saw what was happening.
0:21:59|0:22:4|[Xiaojie's Mom] glanced over and locked eyes with Xiaomei, whose arm was wrapped in bandages.
0:22:4|0:22:8|The next moment, a slap landed directly on Xiaojie's face.
0:22:19|0:22:33|[Xiaojie's Mom] realized that she had misunderstood Xiaojie, quickly squatted down, slowly embraced the injured Xiaojie, the hug getting tighter and tighter, almost making Xiaojie unable to breathe.
0:22:33|0:22:39|The two slowly got up, packed their things and were about to leave when [Xiaojie's Mom] asked with concern.
0:22:42|0:22:51|After a simple farewell, Xie Xinmei watched Xiaojie and his mom leave, lowered her head with a hint of regret, feeling a mix of emotions in her heart, but unable to speak.
0:22:51|0:22:55|At this moment, Xiaojie suddenly came back and spoke to her.
0:22:55|0:23:1|Xie Xinmei looked up in surprise, watching Xiaojie's comical injury, and her mouth involuntarily curved upwards.
0:23:8|0:23:12|The next day, their actions quickly sparked malicious speculation among their schoolmates.
0:23:12|0:23:17|Faced with baseless gossip, Xiaojie looked helplessly at Xie Xinmei in the front row.
0:23:17|0:23:21|Late at night, the streets were deserted and unusually quiet.
0:23:21|0:23:25|[Xie Xinmei's Dad] returned home with a paper box clamped under his left arm.
0:23:30|0:23:36|[Xie Xinmei] quickly took the paper box and opened it curiously, only to find a handicraft elephant inside.
0:24:0|0:24:6|[Xie Xinmei] held the paper box, facing her father's refusal, feeling reluctant in her heart but had to give in.
0:24:6|0:24:12|The camera cuts to [Xie Xinmei], sitting on the sofa, carefully taking out the elephant and examining it.
0:24:12|0:24:19|This is a carefully crafted piece of artwork, with movable joints at the four legs and nose.
0:24:19|0:24:22|Unfortunately, one leg has not been installed yet.
0:24:22|0:24:27|Xie Xinmei gently touched it, then looked out the window, making a decision in her heart.
0:24:53|0:25:0|[Grandpa Xie Xinmei] played the elephant, which appeared behind him, moving slowly but powerfully, occasionally making a low rumbling sound.
0:25:2|0:25:9|The elephant, dragging its heavy body, slowly approached Xie Xinmei, its low rumbling sound seemed to be telling something.
0:25:9|0:25:14|One step, two steps, three steps, the elephant finally walked up to [Xie Xinmei].
0:25:14|0:25:21|Xie Xinmei looked at the elephant struggling to walk, raised her hand involuntarily, and tenderly touched its head.
0:25:21|0:25:25|The warmth transmitted by the palm also gave the elephant a little comfort.
0:25:25|0:25:28|Gentle caresses, like a bridge to the soul.
0:25:28|0:25:32|The elephant trumpeted loudly, as if in response to Xie Xinmei.
0:25:34|0:25:38|Xie Xinmei looked at the elephant struggling to walk, her eyes filled with tenderness.
0:25:38|0:25:44|The dim light shone on them, like entering the gate to a fairy tale world.
0:25:44|0:25:51|They accompany each other, walking towards the direction guided by their hearts.
0:26:14|0:26:21|Xiaomei placed the elephant aside, gently nudged [Xie Xinmei's Grandpa], and called out again.
0:26:21|0:26:30|The grandfather, who was sound asleep, finally woke up. He saw Xie Xinmei approaching with sleepy eyes, and his face lit up with joy, revealing a kind smile.
0:26:30|0:26:34|Upon seeing her grandfather, [Xie Xinmei] flashed a long-lost smile.
0:26:40|0:26:46|Xie Xinmei nodded, and Grandpa patted the sofa, gesturing for Xie Xinmei to sit down.
0:26:46|0:26:50|Xie Xinmei turned around, picked up the elephant handicraft, and sat next to her grandfather.
0:26:55|0:26:58|Grandpa took the elephant and examined it carefully.
0:27:11|0:27:18|Xie Xinmei extends her right pinky finger to make a promise with her grandfather, who firmly hooks his pinky finger with hers.
0:27:18|0:27:24|Xie Xinmei was especially happy to see this, gently leaning her head on her grandfather's shoulder, feeling the warmth of being with him.
0:27:56|0:28:5|Approaching the door, just about to open it, the bell suddenly stopped ringing. After a few seconds of contemplation, she decided to see what was going on.
0:28:5|0:28:11|Xie Xinmei, who was still not fully awake, slowly walked towards the door, glanced at the living room with bleary eyes, and looked around.
0:28:12|0:28:27|No abnormalities were found. Late at night, everything in the room seemed to be still. The portraits on the wall appeared more mysterious in the dim light, and only the fish swimming in the aquarium could prove that time was passing second by second.
0:28:27|0:28:41|Everything just now felt like a dream. Xie Xinmei checked and found nothing unusual, then turned back to her room. Just as she was about to close the door and go to sleep, suddenly, the lights in the living room behind her turned on. A sense of unease crept into Xinmei's heart, prompting her to open the door once again.
0:28:43|0:28:49|The two turned around, and [Xie Xinmei's Mom] ran towards Xiaomei.
0:28:49|0:28:55|Xie Xinmei's Mom casually threw on a coat, slipped on her slippers, and ran out without looking back.
0:28:55|0:29:1|With a heavy click of the latch, the room fell back into a dreadful silence.
0:29:1|0:29:5|Xie Xinmei stood bewildered at the end of the corridor, the lights suddenly dimming.
0:29:8|0:29:15|In the early morning, the chirping of birds breaks the silence of the night, and the sun slowly rises to illuminate the earth.
0:29:15|0:29:19|Xie Xinmei sat by the window, about to complete the starry sky puzzle in her hands.
0:29:19|0:29:25|Xie Xinmei's Dad, dressed in a suit, walked over and looked at Xiaomei's back with concern.
0:29:38|0:29:46|Xie Xinmei listened to her parents' conversation with a blank expression, continuing to work on the puzzle in her hands without stopping, sadness evident in her eyes.
0:29:49|0:29:53|Xie Xinmei pressed one of the pieces, only to find that a piece was missing from the puzzle.
0:29:53|0:29:59|She looked around the table searching, but found nothing. Then she picked up the puzzle box, but still found nothing.
0:30:0|0:30:6|Xie Xinmei got up, lifted the carpet, and then ran to the cabinet where the puzzles were placed, searching around.
0:30:6|0:30:12|Perplexed Xie Xinmei leaned over to flip the bed, and the last puzzle piece seemed to disappear into thin air.
0:30:12|0:30:16|After searching around in a big circle, Xie Xinmei was already panting heavily.
0:30:16|0:30:24|She sat on the ground, looking at the almost completed puzzle in front of her, and finally, the emotions hidden deep in her heart erupted.
0:30:24|0:30:28|She opened the box and started throwing her most beloved doll and toys around.
0:30:29|0:30:34|The flying doll soared into the air and landed heavily on the ground, bouncing far away.
0:30:34|0:30:42|Xie Xinmei, filled with sorrow, couldn't face this huge blow. She never imagined that the calmest person would leave her like this.
0:30:42|0:30:46|Alone, lonely, lost, and helpless, [Xie Xinmei] felt suffocated.
0:30:50|0:30:57|At this moment, [Xie Xinmei] has lost her sanity, as if throwing these away can bring her back to the days when her grandfather was still around.
0:30:57|0:31:2|After a burst of catharsis, the sad and suppressed emotions were finally released.
0:31:2|0:31:8|At this moment, [Xie Xinmei] was already exhausted, and then slowly collapsed on the ground.
0:31:8|0:31:17|After a while, [Xie Xinmei] got up, picked up the elephant given by her grandfather that was placed on the bedside, holding onto the last bit of memory with her grandfather, [Xie Xinmei] finally couldn't hold back her tears.
0:31:17|0:31:20|He was extremely sad and tears streamed down his face.
0:31:20|0:31:24|The images in his mind were all about the warm moments with his grandfather in the countryside cottage.
0:31:25|0:31:33|The sudden departure made [Xie Xinmei] unable to accept, as if the missing last piece of the puzzle was her lost heart.
0:31:33|0:31:41|The scene shifts, the dejected [Xie Xinmei] walks through the school corridor, passing by classmates playing and laughing without expression.
0:31:41|0:31:52|In the math class, the voice of [Teacher Yijiao] echoed throughout the classroom. [Xie Xinmei] was lying on the desk, staring at her pencil case with a vacant look. Xiaojie, sitting in the last row, looked at her with concern.
0:31:53|0:32:1|On the way home, [Xie Xinmei] on the bus seemed lost in thought, and Miss could only quietly follow her.
0:32:1|0:32:10|Unconsciously, [Xie Xinmei] walked to the stationery store where she had stolen before. Watching [Xie Xinmei] enter the store, the lady hesitated a bit but still followed her in.
0:32:11|0:32:18|Lost in thought, [Xie Xinmei] slowly came to a stop next to the shelves, the exquisite stationery around her holding no appeal.
0:32:18|0:32:25|Turning around, she saw the eraser on the shelf. After a few seconds of hesitation, she casually picked up the eraser and stuffed it into her backpack.
0:32:25|0:32:36|The boss lady who was calculating saw this scene, but excessive sadness caused [Xie Xinmei] to not care about anything. Everything she saw, she stuffed into her backpack.
0:32:37|0:32:41|The landlady stared at [Xie Xinmei] intently, knowing she was about to leave.
0:32:47|0:32:54|Xiaojie suddenly grabbed [Xie Xinmei], who stared expressionlessly at Xiaojie in front of her.
0:32:54|0:33:0|Xiaojie softly woke up [Xie Xinmei], she looked around the stationery store and finally realized her mistake.
0:33:1|0:33:3|At night, in front of [Xie Xinmei]'s house.
0:33:3|0:33:9|The sorrowful [Xie Xinmei] forced a smile, ready to part ways, but Xiaojie spoke first.
0:33:9|0:33:11|Xie Xinmei turned around upon hearing this.
0:33:29|0:33:32|Xie Xinmei was surprised by Xiaojie's Mom's invitation and agreed without thinking.
0:33:37|0:33:41|The two met with a smile, and the atmosphere gradually became warm.
0:33:41|0:33:46|The next day, the sunlight streamed into the room, and the alarm clock rang crisply on time.
0:33:46|0:33:50|Xie Xinmei, who got up early, hurried over to turn off the alarm clock.
0:33:50|0:33:53|She neatly hung up her pajamas and put on a clean school uniform.
0:33:53|0:33:58|Looking at herself in the mirror, she smoothed her hair and the sadness on her face slowly dissipated.
0:33:58|0:34:1|As soon as she stepped out of the house, she was stopped by Xiaojie, who had been waiting for a long time.
0:34:5|0:34:12|Xiaojie stood up, shyly walked towards Xinmei. The moment their eyes met, they quickly separated and looked elsewhere.
0:34:12|0:34:15|They walked side by side towards the school with their heads down.
0:34:24|0:34:29|Xiaojie patiently teaches [Xie Xinmei] how to fold origami, and the two gradually build a friendship.
0:34:29|0:34:35|From simple origami rabbits to complex elephants and giraffes, Xiaojie patiently guides the way.
0:34:35|0:34:42|The cute rabbit origami seemed to come to life, hopping along behind them, and Xiaojie's presence dispelled the sadness.
0:34:42|0:34:46|From then on, [Xie Xinmei] had many more smiles on her face.
0:34:46|0:34:52|In the classroom, the two of them are discussing the method of origami folding. Whenever [Xie Xinmei] doesn't understand, Xiaojie patiently explains.
0:34:52|0:35:1|The cool blackboard was decorated by them like a scene from a fairy tale, with warm sunshine, fresh trees and grass, and a small wooden house not far away.
0:35:1|0:35:6|And the origami rabbits, giraffes, elephants, and birds they folded all came to life.
0:35:7|0:35:17|These adorable little animals accompanied [Xie Xinmei] and [Xiaojie], creating a wonderful blend of fairy tale and reality, spending joyful moments with them day after day.
0:35:17|0:35:24|[Xie Xinmei] and Xiaojie also gained precious artistic and unforgettable memories in each other's company.
0:35:24|0:35:34|Through the day and night efforts of the two, the blackboard was gradually filled with various animal characters, adding a lot of liveliness to the classroom with its cute and interesting style.
0:35:35|0:35:39|The Western elegance is soft and gentle, scattered all over the place.
0:35:39|0:35:57|The two looked at the calm lake in front of them, feeling the good times of their youth. The smiles they shared when they first met, along with the gentle breeze, blended together, making people unable to help but be enchanted by it.
0:35:57|0:35:59|The scene shifts to the classroom.
0:36:50|0:36:56|Classmates all felt sorry for [Xie Xinmei], as Chen Weixiang awkwardly dropped the broom in his hand and walked towards the door.
0:37:2|0:37:6|Chen Wei threw the origami on the ground with a look of defiance.
0:37:6|0:37:12|After school, [Xie Xinmei] pushed open the door of her house. The lights inside were dim, with faint music playing in the background.
0:37:12|0:37:19|She followed the voice into the house, where various boxes were stacked haphazardly and the floor was in a mess.
0:37:19|0:37:24|[Xie Xinmei's Mom] is holding a glass of red wine while casually arranging the opened old envelopes.
0:37:25|0:37:33|Among a pile of old items, [Xie Xinmei's Mom] found a cassette tape. She picked up the tape and examined it carefully, all the while taking big gulps of alcohol.
0:37:37|0:37:40|Xie Xinmei's Mom, sitting on the ground, saw Xie Xinmei coming back and said to her,
0:37:45|0:37:46|[Xie Xinmei] suddenly looked up.
0:38:13|0:38:25|[Xie Xinmei's Mom] awkwardly picked up the food and fed it into her mouth, without asking further questions, she smiled.
0:38:25|0:38:33|[Xie Xinmei] thought for a moment, then smiled and nodded at [Xie Xinmei's Mom].
0:38:33|0:38:36|[Xie Xinmei] pondered for a moment before speaking to [Xie Xinmei's Mom].
0:38:41|0:38:47|[Xie Xinmei's Mom] took a big sip of red wine, gazing into the distance with inscrutable thoughts.
0:38:53|0:38:59|[Xie Xinmei's Mom] looked dazed, resting the wine glass against her cheek, and looked up at [Xie Xinmei].
0:39:16|0:39:24|[Xie Xinmei] was pulled to the center of the restaurant by [Xie Xinmei's Mom].
0:39:24|0:39:33|[Xie Xinmei] appeared somewhat reluctant, but feeling the gazes of the people around her, she felt a bit awkward and her movements were stiff. However, [Xie Xinmei's Mom] was very happy.
0:39:33|0:39:36|Dancing left and right in the restaurant.
0:39:38|0:39:41|The guests looked at the two people in front of them in astonishment.
0:39:41|0:39:50|As the music continued, the reluctant [Xie Xinmei] gradually became more comfortable, starting to enjoy the dance and the gaze of the people around her.
0:39:50|0:39:56|The surrounding guests were gradually infected by the duo's dance and unconsciously moved along with the music.
0:39:57|0:40:4|[Xie Xinmei] was gradually led by [Xie Xinmei's Mom], snapping her fingers and dancing with a happy smile.
0:40:4|0:40:12|The music slowly fades out, and the happy [Xie Xinmei] turns to look at her mom, [Xie Xinmei's Mom], who is still dancing. Then she sits back down in her seat, as if she has returned to her childhood.
0:40:14|0:40:21|In front of [Xie Xinmei's Mom], there was no smile on her face, instead, it was like a cold machine, repeating the same motion over and over.
0:40:26|0:40:35|At this moment, the memories of the past rush towards [Xie Xinmei's Mom] like a torrent, the joys and sorrows of life, only known to this woman herself.
0:40:35|0:40:42|Watching [Xie Xinmei's Mom] in such pain, [Xie Xinmei] fell into contemplation. What has she been through to make her mother so fragile?
0:40:43|0:40:48|[Xie Xinmei's Mom] finally stopped moving and stood still, quietly sobbing.
0:40:48|0:40:56|[Xie Xinmei]'s eyes were filled with concern. She didn't know what had happened, nor did she know how to comfort the injured [Xie Xinmei's Mom].
0:40:57|0:41:11|The next day, Xiaojie and [Xie Xinmei] walked on the sparsely populated street, stopped in front of a shop, with flowers neatly arranged on both sides of the door, the wooden door frame full of style, adding a touch of mystery to the small shop.
0:41:11|0:41:19|The small shop sells a variety of exquisite puzzles. Although it is not large, the wooden shelves are neatly arranged, giving off a quaint atmosphere.
0:41:20|0:41:25|Xiaojie walked up to the puzzle wall covered with famous paintings and stared at the pictures in a daze.
0:41:25|0:41:30|[Xie Xinmei] was a bit puzzled. She followed Xiaojie's gaze and took the initiative to explain to Xiaojie.
0:42:1|0:42:4|[Xie Xinmei] looked a bit lonely and continued speaking.
0:42:17|0:42:24|The landlady awkwardly turned away and the young lady took the initiative to approach [Xie Xinmei], saying.
0:43:3|0:43:4|After the children have been spelling for a long time.
0:43:16|0:43:20|[Xie Xinmei] smiled when she saw the explanation on the table and said to her.
0:43:44|0:43:48|The world's first jigsaw puzzle, [Xie Xinmei] looked up and saw her angry mom.
0:44:0|0:44:11|Seeing her mom's determined gaze, [Xie Xinmei]'s luck suddenly ran out. She glanced at her dad, then put down her utensils and walked towards the room.
0:44:11|0:44:20|[Xie Xinmei] walked into the room without turning on the light. Reluctant to close the door slowly, she caught a glimpse of her mom walking towards the tape recorder as she shut the door.
0:44:21|0:44:38|Inside the room, [Xie Xinmei] was feeling anxious. She pressed her ear against the glass, trying to hear her parents' conversation. The music swelled, drowning out their voices, and despite her efforts, all [Xie Xinmei] could hear was a buzzing echo as she strained to listen through the glass.
0:44:39|0:44:53|Hidden in the room, [Xie Xinmei] is engulfed by darkness, only able to touch the only light by getting close to the glass door. The camera keeps switching, sometimes showing the arguing faces of her parents, and sometimes their confused gazes at each other.
0:44:53|0:44:59|Inside the house, [Xie Xinmei] couldn't hear the conversation between the two, but she could feel their growing agitation and frenzy.
0:44:59|0:45:2|[Xie Xinmei] closes her eyes, as if trying to escape from everything.
0:45:2|0:45:13|The argument escalated, and the only glass fish tank in the house was knocked over, crashing heavily to the ground. The shards of glass and water splashed out, instantly flowing in the direction of [Xie Xinmei].
0:45:13|0:45:22|Startled by the argument, [Xie Xinmei] who was still stealing, took a few steps back, realizing that the situation was out of control. She quickly crouched down and tried to see what was happening through the crack under the door.
0:45:22|0:45:28|However, all they could see was the whale in front of them thrashing on the ground in a desperate struggle.
0:45:29|0:45:48|The scene shifts to the classroom, where Xiaojie and [Xie Xinmei] have already finished decorating the blackboard. The sun and clouds are designed in 3D, with different small animals in the classification above the blackboard. The two look at the carefully arranged blackboard. Xiaojie says.
0:45:48|0:45:54|Xiaojie got up and left after speaking, lowering his head as he walked towards the door. When he turned back, he found Xie Xinmei still staring at the blackboard.
0:46:2|0:46:5|Xiaojie, lost in thought, glanced at [Xie Xinmei] and replied.
0:46:17|0:46:20|The night was late, and the noisy campus was unusually quiet.
0:46:20|0:46:26|In the corridor of the teaching building, two figures can be seen entering a certain classroom one after the other.
0:46:26|0:46:30|[Xiaojie] and [Xie Xinmei] gently closed the door and then turned on the flashlight.
0:46:30|0:46:33|It turns out to be the blackboard of another class.
0:46:38|0:46:40|The two arrived at another classroom.
0:46:59|0:47:4|The next day, [Xiaojie] and [Xie Xinmei] arrived at school with excitement and joy.
0:47:10|0:47:14|[Xie Xinmei] looked happily at [Xiaojie], then ran to the door of the classroom.
0:47:14|0:47:17|The doorway was crowded with classmates, their eyes filled with mockery.
0:47:17|0:47:22|They then all looked at the blackboard one after another, whispering and discussing something with their hands covering their mouths.
0:47:22|0:47:26|[Xie Xinmei] was shocked as soon as she arrived at the door and saw what was happening in front of her.
0:47:26|0:47:36|She looked at [Xiaojie] in a panic, and following Xiaomei's gaze, Xiaojie saw the origami on the blackboard being torn down haphazardly, and the carefully arranged blackboard was destroyed beyond recognition.
0:47:37|0:47:43|Classmates in the classroom are busy tidying up, while a few mischievous students are throwing the scattered origami around.
0:47:43|0:47:47|[Xiaojie] looked on in shock, his face twitching involuntarily.
0:47:47|0:47:52|He then looked around at his classmates, as if searching for something.
0:47:52|0:47:57|He lay on the railing looking out at the playground, with no one in the classroom or the hallway.
0:47:57|0:48:4|Chen Weixiang and his group caught his attention, he then turned to look at Xiaomei, and without looking back, he ran down.
0:48:5|0:48:32|Xie Xinmei watched as Xiaojie ran off and then glanced at Chen Weixiang on the playground, feeling a sense of foreboding. The crowded people blocked her way, but Xiaojie pushed through without hesitation. Worried that Xiaojie might do something foolish, Xie Xinmei quickly caught up. Just as Chen Weixiang entered the teaching building, Xiaojie brushed past from another building, and seeing Chen Weixiang and his group standing in the opposite building, Xiaojie chased after them again. Xie Xinmei looked at the teaching building in front of her, but couldn't find any trace of Xiaojie.
0:48:34|0:48:39|A shattered voice pierced the sky, and Xie Xinmei quickly ran towards the direction of the sound.
0:48:39|0:48:46|She can no longer hear the surrounding noise, only the beating of her heart reminding her that she is exhausted at this moment.
0:48:54|0:48:56|Just as the words were spoken, a figure suddenly rushed out.
0:48:58|0:49:12|Out of nowhere, little [Xie Xinmei] appeared and punched Chen Weixiang in the left face, causing a scream that quickly drew the attention of all the students in the school.
0:49:12|0:49:17|Xie Xinmei, out of control, pinned Chen Weixiang to the ground and vented her anger with her fists.
0:49:17|0:49:22|In the classroom, the torn blackboard decorations are scattered on the floor, and several students are cleaning up.
0:49:22|0:49:28|[Xie Xinmei] held the origami rabbit in her hand, watching her hard work being destroyed, feeling a mix of emotions in her heart.
0:49:28|0:49:32|Principal's office, Xiaojie receives harsh criticism.
0:49:33|0:49:35|Pointing with her finger at Xiaojie, who was bowing his head.
0:49:35|0:49:39|Xiaojie's Mom and Teacher Yijiao could only remain silent on the side.
0:49:39|0:49:42|On a rainy night, Xiaojie walks on the wet street.
0:49:42|0:49:44|Xiaojie's Mom carrying the trash.
0:49:49|0:49:54|Xiaojie lowered his head and quickly walked towards his mom.
0:49:54|0:50:0|Xiaojie held a drawing board in his left hand and took a plastic bag from [Xiaojie's Mom] with his right hand.
0:50:0|0:50:4|[Xiaojie's Mom] opened the front door on the first floor, and the two of them turned and headed upstairs.
0:50:4|0:50:32|The scene shifts, [Xie Xinmei] is looking through binoculars towards Xiaojie's window, only to see the window tightly closed with the curtains drawn. The light inside indicates someone is home. [Xie Xinmei] puts down the binoculars. At that moment, [Xie Xinmei's Mom] knocks on the door. On the dining table, [Xie Xinmei] rolls the apple in her hand out of boredom. She stops, showing no intention of stopping. Thank you, sister. [Xie Xinmei] halts the rolling motion. Both [Xie Xinmei's Dad] and [Xie Xinmei's Mom] look at her simultaneously. [Xie Xinmei's Dad] speaks to [Xie Xinmei's Mom].
0:51:2|0:51:5|[Xie Xinmei] looked at [Xie Xinmei's Mom] and repeated the sentence.
0:51:55|0:51:59|[Xie Xinmei]'s tears began to well up in her eyes.
0:51:59|0:52:3|Looking at the face of [Xie Xinmei's Dad], [Xie Xinmei] struggled to control the tears in her eyes.
0:52:3|0:52:8|In the room, [Xie Xinmei] turned off the light, sat on the bed, holding an alarm clock in her hand, looking very sad.
0:52:9|0:52:14|He looked up and saw the only ray of light outside the window, a thought sprouted in his mind.
0:52:14|0:52:24|He got up and opened the cabinet, randomly grabbed a few pieces of clothing to stuff into his backpack, then dug out some pocket money from the drawer. He took off his pajamas and put on a simple and neat shirt and jacket.
0:52:24|0:52:33|He opened the drawer, took out a flashlight with sufficient battery power, casually grabbed the binoculars, and then put on his favorite hat.
0:52:33|0:52:36|After bustling around for a while, she sat heavily on the bed with her school bag.
0:52:36|0:52:40|He looked around at everything and made up his mind to turn off the lights and leave.
0:52:40|0:52:44|The streets were deserted at night, with only a few street lamps flickering.
0:52:44|0:52:47|[Xie Xinmei] crossed the road with her backpack and arrived at Xiaojie's house downstairs.
0:52:47|0:52:50|He intended to ring the doorbell, but after checking the time on his watch, he realized it was too late.
0:52:51|0:52:53|After much thought, she decided to give up.
0:52:53|0:52:59|Later, under the window of Xiaojie's room, [Xie Xinmei] meowed like a cat, trying to get Xiaojie's attention.
0:52:59|0:53:3|He called out once, then looked at the window, seemingly getting no response.
0:53:3|0:53:8|[Xie Xinmei] tried again, calling out several times in a row, but still got no response.
0:53:8|0:53:10|At this moment, a figure slowly walked up from behind.
0:53:12|0:53:19|[Xie Xinmei] quickly turned around in fright, only to see Xiaojie. The next second, the terror on her face turned into a big smile.
0:53:19|0:53:26|The two sit on the slide in the park. Xiaojie asks [Xie Xinmei], who hesitates a bit before answering.
0:54:2|0:54:5|They both looked at each other and smiled.
0:54:5|0:54:24|The scene shifts, with a train approaching in the distance. In the quiet night, it breaks through the darkness along the railway tracks. Inside the carriage, several passengers waiting to go home are scattered, their faces full of weariness, spending this long time in a dream. Excited, [Xie Xinmei] looks at the trees flashing by outside the window, without a hint of sleepiness.
0:54:25|0:54:31|Beside him, Xiaojie was already exhausted. Shortly after boarding the train, he leaned against the seat and fell into a deep sleep.
0:54:31|0:54:39|[Xie Xinmei] looked at Xiaojie's sleeping face with a gentle smile. Outside the window was pitch black, with only [Xie Xinmei]'s face reflected on the glass.
0:54:40|0:54:47|Slowly, [Xie Xinmei] seemed to enter a fairy tale world, with houses outside the window starting to light up one by one.
0:54:47|0:54:54|[Xie Xinmei] looked out the window with a mix of surprise and joy, while Xiaojie, beside her, unconsciously leaned his head on [Xie Xinmei]'s shoulder as the train swayed.
0:54:55|0:55:2|[Xie Xinmei] smiled and let Xiaojie lean on her, then turned her head to continue enjoying the beautiful fairytale scenery outside the window.
0:55:2|0:55:9|The train continued to move forward, and the wheels miraculously lifted slowly, carrying the entire train up into the sky.
0:55:9|0:55:21|In the blink of an eye, the train headed towards the starry world in the puzzle, with various shaped sheds and neatly arranged trees on both sides of the road, emitting a faint light. It was this faint gray light that illuminated the direction of the train's journey.
0:55:23|0:55:29|The myriad stars in the sky hurriedly gather together, emitting a quiet and gentle light.
0:55:29|0:55:35|With a loud whistle, the train soared into the sky, rushing towards the galaxy of stars.
0:55:35|0:55:40|The old and mottled train continued to travel, shuttling through clusters of dazzling starry skies.
0:55:40|0:55:45|No one knew where it was heading, but that was not the direction of happiness.
0:55:45|0:55:47|Xiaowei in the car looked up at the dazzling starry sky of honor.
0:55:48|0:56:3|Looking at the stars, the fast-moving train rushes out, coming from the starry sky, passing through the galaxy woven by stars, passing through the transparent and warm village lit by lights, drawing a perfect demeanor for the sky with beautiful curves, such a brilliant scenery.
0:56:4|0:56:9|The night sky is adorned with twinkling stars, capturing the beauty of the world in this moment.
0:56:9|0:56:14|The train returned from the sky to underwater, and in the moment of docking, it returned to the real world again.
0:56:14|0:56:22|The distant sky gradually brightens, and the train slows down as it pulls into the platform. With a loud screech of the brakes, the train stops and the doors open.
0:56:23|0:56:33|Xiaojie and [Xie Xinmei] slowly walked down, getting off the train when the day was not fully bright yet. The two looked around, seeing the railway surrounded by trees, and walked into the railway one after the other.
0:56:33|0:56:35|Heading towards the forest.
0:56:35|0:56:49|[Xie Xinmei] and Xiaojie were walking on a country road. [Xie Xinmei] was leisurely whistling, with a smile on her face. Their steps were light as a truck approached from behind. They stopped by the roadside, and [Xie Xinmei] waved to signal the truck to stop.
0:57:0|0:57:7|Cars pass through the mountain roads, surrounded by lush green leaves and soft clouds hanging in the sky.
0:57:7|0:57:15|Xiaojie and [Xie Xinmei] sat in a train car filled with watermelons, watching the road slowly recede behind them, enjoying the gentle breeze.
0:57:15|0:57:20|They were extremely happy eating watermelon, chatting and laughing as they licked from their tongues to their hearts.
0:57:22|0:57:26|The sunlight poured down, shining on the strands of hair of [Xie Xinmei], reflecting a glow.
0:57:26|0:57:33|The image of the girl in front of him was deeply engraved in Xiaojie's heart, leaving the westernized Xiaojie stunned.
0:57:33|0:57:43|Not long after, the truck stopped at an intersection, and Xiaojie helped [Xie Xinmei] off the truck. The two of them and the driver exchanged simple thanks and goodbyes before heading towards the forest.
0:57:47|0:57:53|The truck slowly drove away, the two of them filled with excitement and anticipation, starting this unknown journey.
0:58:41|0:58:44|Xie Xinmei looked at Xiaojie, who had been silent all the way, and asked him.
0:58:58|0:59:0|[Xiaojie] turned his head to the side and said.
0:59:1|0:59:5|[Xie Xinmei] deliberately stepped on him when she saw his unwillingness.
0:59:6|0:59:9|[Xiaojie] also lightly stepped on [Xie Xinmei].
0:59:16|0:59:25|[Xie Xinmei] stepped heavily on [Xiaojie]'s foot, turning the originally cheerful atmosphere into an awkward moment. Both of them raised the bread in their hands and took a bite at the same time.
0:59:25|0:59:35|The scene shifts, with the two walking to a fork in the road. [Xie Xinmei] goes left, while [Xiaojie] continues straight down the right path. [Xie Xinmei] calls out to him.
0:59:35|0:59:40|[Xiaojie] turned around and saw [Xie Xinmei] standing still. As he approached, he heard her say.
0:59:52|0:59:57|[Xie Xinmei] turned around and looked at the small path with few footprints, nodding in approval.
0:59:57|1:0:0|[Xiaojie] hesitated, but still decided to believe.
1:0:4|1:0:10|The two of them walked through the large tree in front of them with sticks they picked up casually, continuing to advance deeper into the forest.
1:0:10|1:0:20|Xiaojie and [Xie Xinmei] walked into the dense forest, in front of them were layers of forests, the two looked around, it was endless, with trees of varying heights.
1:0:20|1:0:29|The initial excitement was gradually worn down by the repetitive scenery, as night fell and the two of them began to tire, their steps becoming heavier.
1:0:51|1:1:7|Shaken, [Xie Xinmei]'s legs went weak. Seeing this, Xiaojie grabbed [Xie Xinmei] and hurried away without looking back. As the night grew darker, the whole forest gradually fell into darkness. The silence was only broken by the chirping of birds, making Xiaojie and [Xie Xinmei] still unable to recover from the fright they had just experienced.
1:1:8|1:1:21|The two of them now only felt fear afterwards, the night forest had too many unknowns, and the two of them could only continue to move forward now, searching for a place to stay overnight, the air was shrouded in thick fog, and from time to time they could hear the rustling of leaves in the wind.
1:1:30|1:1:35|Raising her head, Xie Xinmei saw tree branches gnashing and waving in the silent forest, appearing particularly frightening.
1:1:35|1:1:41|In the deep night, the forest was silent and eerie, the wind howled coldly, and the rain started to pour down.
1:1:41|1:1:44|Xiaojie and [Xie Xinmei] could only rely on the only flashlight to find their way.
1:1:44|1:1:49|The rain fell harder and harder, soaking their hair and drenching their clothes.
1:1:49|1:1:53|Xiaojie looks back at [Xie Xinmei] every step he takes.
1:1:53|1:2:2|In the midst of despair, Xiaojie looked up and saw a house on the opposite hill. Overjoyed, he turned to [Xie Xinmei] and said,
1:2:2|1:2:22|Xie Xinmei shone the flashlight ahead, a hint of smile finally appeared on her troubled face. The two walked towards the house along the path, one in front and one behind. The scene shifted, Xiaojie opened the door and looked around with the only light source. The two cautiously moved towards the inside of the house, Xiaojie politely inquired about the furnishings inside.
1:2:22|1:2:25|One can tell that this is an abandoned church.
1:2:25|1:2:27|Wooden benches are casually stacked and placed.
1:2:27|1:2:34|In front, there is a small stage with a cross on the left and a piano piled with miscellaneous items on the right.
1:2:34|1:2:38|The two decided to settle here first, tidying up their wet clothes and belongings.
1:2:40|1:2:45|[Xie Xinmei] carefully wipes her wet hair with a towel as Xiaojie turns around to take off his wet clothes.
1:2:45|1:2:52|[Xie Xinmei] looked at Xiaojie's back and felt a little shy for a moment. Then she looked up and noticed a scar on Xiaojie's shoulder.
1:2:52|1:2:57|[Xie Xinmei] unconsciously reached out to touch Xiaojie's scar, which scared him into quickly turning away.
1:3:4|1:3:10|[Xie Xinmei] hesitated, looking around the empty church with no place to hide.
1:3:10|1:3:12|Next, she looked at Xiaojie in front of her.
1:3:35|1:3:38|Upon hearing Xiaojie's response, Xie Xinmei finally let go of her worries.
1:3:38|1:3:41|Facing the darkness, [Xiaojie] looked around.
1:3:41|1:3:46|Upon turning around, [Xie Xinmei] unexpectedly saw the light from a flashlight casting the shadow of her changing clothes on the wall.
1:3:46|1:3:50|The girl's petite figure is fully revealed under the lighting.
1:3:50|1:3:55|Shy [Xiaojie] quickly lowered his head, perhaps due to teenagers' curiosity about the opposite sex's bodies.
1:3:55|1:4:0|[Xiaojie] slowly looked at the shadow of the girl in front of him, feeling ripples in his heart.
1:4:0|1:4:4|In the shadow, [Xie Xinmei] takes off her wet clothes and shakes out her hair.
1:4:4|1:4:7|[Xiaojie] couldn't help but swallow hard as he looked at the scene.
1:4:7|1:4:11|Before long, [Xie Xinmei] put on the last coat.
1:4:15|1:4:19|[Xie Xinmei] turned around, only to see [Xiaojie] staring fixedly at the shadow on the wall.
1:4:19|1:4:24|Xie Xinmei was instantly angry and embarrassed when she saw it, and she ran over to turn off the flashlight.
1:4:28|1:4:33|The dim matches lit up, and Xie Xinmei lit the candles in the church one by one.
1:4:33|1:4:39|The clothes soaked by the rain were hung up high, and [Xiaojie's Mom] and Xie Xinmei lay down and started chatting.
1:5:1|1:5:9|Xiaomei smiled passively, and [Xiaojie's Mom] spoke again.
1:5:9|1:5:23|Xie Xinmei's expression on her face gradually hardened, she turned her head to the other side and said somewhat sadly.
1:5:23|1:5:28|Xiaojie's Mom and Xie Xinmei lie on the long bench, with Xiaojie's Mom looking at the somewhat sad Xiaomei.
1:5:30|1:5:42|My parents were arguing fiercely, with [Xiaojie's Mom] standing by quietly, listening to Xiaomei telling a story.
1:5:47|1:5:52|Xie Xinmei's gaze was vacant, her thoughts drifting back to a long, long time ago.
1:7:4|1:7:9|Xiaomei couldn't believe that [Xiaojie's Mom] had such an experience.
1:7:21|1:7:27|Memories kept flooding back, as [Xiaojie's Mom] spoke, she started to choke up, tears welling up in her eyes.
1:7:30|1:7:37|Xiaojie propped his head with his hand, trying hard to control his emotions, but tears still uncontrollably streamed down his face.
1:7:48|1:7:51|[Xie Xinmei's Mom] couldn't help but frown as she listened to Xiaojie's ordeal.
1:8:5|1:8:10|[Xie Xinmei] turned her head to look at Xiaojie, wanting to comfort him but not knowing how to start.
1:8:10|1:8:14|She slowly reached out her right hand towards Xiaojie, wanting to bring him warmth.
1:8:14|1:8:20|When their hands touched, it was as if two people who shared the same suffering had found redemption.
1:8:24|1:8:28|Looking into Xiaojie's eyes, [Xie Xinmei] felt a bit at a loss and turned her head to the side.
1:8:28|1:8:32|At that moment, [Xie Xinmei] had a bold idea in her mind.
1:8:36|1:8:38|[Xie Xinmei] walks towards the stage on the side.
1:8:43|1:8:46|Xiaojie walks towards [Xie Xinmei].
1:8:48|1:8:50|[Xie Xinmei] reached out and grabbed Xiaojie's hand.
1:9:38|1:9:43|Xiaojie took one step, two steps, hopping awkwardly as he tried to imitate Xie Xinmei's movements.
1:9:43|1:9:48|The pitter-patter of raindrops served as the accompaniment to their dance.
1:9:48|1:9:53|Xiaojie and [Xie Xinmei] also untie their emotional knots through dancing, becoming important confidants to each other.
1:9:55|1:10:17|The next day, accompanied by a few crisp bird calls, the sun slowly rose. [Xie Xinmei], who was sleeping on a bench, turned over. She slowly opened her eyes and regained consciousness. [Xie Xinmei] pulled herself up against the back of the bench and sat up slowly. Surrounded by dilapidated chairs and drying clothes, she looked around with blurry eyes, confirming her surroundings.
1:10:17|1:10:20|But still couldn't find Xiaojie's shadow.
1:10:20|1:10:32|[Xie Xinmei] walked towards the door with a vacant look, pushed it open, and was surprised by the screen in front of her. The morning sunlight spilled onto the earth, and [Xie Xinmei] looked at Xiaojie sitting at the door enjoying the scenery, and walked towards him.
1:10:47|1:10:54|[Xie Xinmei] sat down next to Xiaojie and watched the relaxed Xiaojie, feeling very happy.
1:10:54|1:11:1|[Xie Xinmei] looked at Xiaojie with a sweet smile on her face, the two of them sat side by side, enjoying the scenery in front of them.
1:11:6|1:11:9|The two exchanged a smile and then looked into the distance.
1:11:9|1:11:15|Xiaojie slowly stood up, only to find that his legs were a bit numb from sitting for too long.
1:11:20|1:11:26|The sudden thank you from [Xiaojie] surprised him, freezing the beautiful scene between the two in the morning sunlight.
1:11:26|1:11:31|[Xiaojie] and [Xie Xinmei] packed up their belongings and set off again along the abandoned railway.
1:11:31|1:11:40|In the early morning, the dust on the leaves was crystal clear, and the sound of birds chirping could be heard in the ears. The two of them walked to the fork in the road again.
1:11:40|1:11:48|Xiaomei looked at the overgrown trees and bushes on the left side, almost covering the road itself, then glanced shyly at [Xiaojie].
1:11:56|1:12:5|Xie Xinmei pushed Xiaojie's back and ran towards the road on the right. They arrived at a tea plantation, where the tea trees swayed in the wind, sprouting small, pointed buds.
1:12:5|1:12:9|Xie Xinmei casually picked a plant, and its refreshing fragrance made her feel cheerful.
1:12:14|1:12:26|They walked in the lush forest, towering trees appearing one after another. Xiaomei led the way, speeding up when she saw familiar scenery, then turned to [Xiaojie] and said.
1:12:27|1:12:47|In front of them appeared an old house covered with moss. Xie Xinmei and [Xiaojie] bent down to walk past the big tree blocking the road, finally arriving at the door of the house. The house had been abandoned for a long time with no one taking care of it, surrounded by overgrown weeds. The paint on the exterior of the house was also peeling off. Xie Xinmei looked at this small house in front of her, feeling a mix of emotions.
1:12:47|1:12:50|[Xiaojie] behind also quickly caught up.
1:12:50|1:12:54|The two exchanged a smile, after several days of rushing around, they finally arrived at their destination.
1:12:54|1:13:0|[Xie Xinmei] slowly walked into the cabin, and as she was about to open the door, she suddenly hesitated.
1:13:5|1:13:9|Xiaojie was a bit surprised, but still respected [Xie Xinmei]'s decision.
1:13:9|1:13:15|[Xie Xinmei] pushed open the door, looking at the familiar furnishings inside the room. In an instant, countless memories flooded her mind.
1:13:15|1:13:20|He turned around, locked the door, and shut himself in this small room of a few square meters.
1:13:20|1:13:23|[Xie Xinmei] slowly walked into the room, looking around.
1:13:24|1:13:29|Near [Xie Xinmei's Grandfather]'s workbench, there are various exquisitely carved wooden animal sculptures displayed.
1:13:29|1:13:35|[Grandpa Xie Xinmei]'s magnifying glass stood upright there, next to some unpolished wood.
1:13:35|1:13:39|[Xie Xinmei] turned around and was surprised to see an unfinished elephant leg on the table.
1:13:39|1:13:45|The elephant's legs have taken shape, with common carving tools and scattered wood chips nearby.
1:13:45|1:13:51|Everything here is covered in thick dust, and the sharp wrong knife has also rusted.
1:13:51|1:14:3|Xie Xinmei picked up the dusty elephant leg, gazed at it for a long time, then placed it against her chest with both hands. She closed her eyes, trying to feel the last trace of warmth from her grandfather in this old wooden carving.
1:14:3|1:14:13|Xie Xinmei continued to walk into the room, and as she looked up, she saw a painting hanging on the bookshelf of herself dancing as a child. In the painting, she was wearing a dance costume, standing with her feet in a turned-out position.
1:14:14|1:14:33|With one hand up and one hand down, smiling as she watched the performance, Xie Xinmei couldn't help but smile as well. Then, she turned her head and saw the neatly arranged stove, the scene of her grandfather cooking for himself vivid in her mind. The next moment, Xie Xinmei's gaze was locked onto the portrait in front of her, staring at it blankly, slowly moving closer.
1:14:33|1:14:52|The figure in the painting is the self from several years ago, with neat and tidy short hair, clear and bright eyes, and most notably, the lips that are difficult to sleep on, the smiling expression that has not changed from childhood to adulthood. Looking at the painting, Xiaomei also showed the same smile as in the painting, tears swirling in her eyes.
1:14:52|1:14:56|Outside the house, [Xiaojie] is sitting on a swing, taking a rest, with the window behind him open.
1:15:0|1:15:11|Xiaojie stood up and walked slowly towards the door. Inside the room, Xiaomei composed herself, opened the door, and led Xiaojie in, taking the initiative to introduce him to the small house.
1:15:15|1:15:17|[Xiaojie] looked at the painting next to him again.
1:15:28|1:15:45|Xiaomei kept recounting her childhood memories to [Xiaojie], describing nights without moonlight, where one couldn't see their own hand in front of their face, only hearing the faint chirping of cicadas. Looking around, it felt like falling into a bottomless dream, with no moon or stars in sight, winding paths through dense forests.
1:15:49|1:16:0|Before long, the sound of footsteps grew closer and closer, and the two finally walked out of the woods.
1:16:0|1:16:9|[Xiaojie] listened to Xiaomei's narration, looking at the vast calm lake in front of them. The scene shifted, and the two of them drifted aimlessly on the lake in a dilapidated and mottled small boat.
1:16:10|1:16:15|The night lake surface is like a mirror reflecting their young faces.
1:16:15|1:16:23|[Xie Xinmei] and Xiaojie sat side by side, looking at the thick fog in the air. [Xie Xinmei] weakly said.
1:16:23|1:16:27|Xiaojie looked at [Xie Xinmei] beside him and comforted her.
1:16:27|1:16:33|[Xie Xinmei] lay in the small boat, listened to Xiaojie's comfort, felt a hint of warmth in her heart, and then closed her eyes.
1:16:37|1:16:41|Speak, she looked up at Xiaojie, and Xiaojie nodded.
1:16:41|1:16:46|[Xie Xinmei] tried to keep chatting with Xiaojie, but her breathing became a bit rapid in her chest.
1:16:46|1:16:52|Xiaojie looked up at the sky shrouded in thick fog, but was certain he could see the beautiful starry sky that [Xie Xinmei] mentioned.
1:17:12|1:17:15|Yipeng's [Xie Xinmei] tightly closed her eyes.
1:17:38|1:17:55|Xiaojie hesitated to speak, but the unresponsive Xie Xinmei caught his attention. When he finally turned around, he saw Xie Xinmei breathing rapidly with a furrowed brow, a sense of unease creeping over him. He quickly placed his hands on Xie Xinmei's forehead, surprised by the burning temperature. He tried to wake Xie Xinmei up.
1:18:1|1:18:4|[Xie Xinmei] looks extremely upset at this moment.
1:18:4|1:18:9|In a hurry, Xiaojie, carrying [Xie Xinmei], ran towards the small house in confusion.
1:18:9|1:18:14|The night was eerily quiet, with only the sound of Xiaojie's anxious footsteps and heavy breathing.
1:18:14|1:18:20|The moon gradually rises, blowing away the thick fog and dressing the forest in a thin veil.
1:18:20|1:18:25|The moonlight shines on Xiaojie's face, sweat trickles down his cheeks, soaking his bangs in front of his forehead.
1:18:26|1:18:32|Xiaojie looked up and gazed at the large pearl-like stars that had appeared at some point.
1:18:32|1:18:36|The dots of light merge together and sprinkle onto the earth.
1:18:36|1:18:43|Xiaojie looked at the beautiful scenery in front of him, but couldn't stay longer, so he continued to run forward with [Xie Xinmei] on his back.
1:18:43|1:18:48|In the small room, [Xie Xinmei] lying on the bed, beads of sweat appeared densely on her forehead.
1:18:48|1:18:54|Xiaojie on the side soaked a towel in cold water, wrung it out, and carefully covered it over Xie Xinmei's forehead.
1:18:55|1:19:1|Sitting by the bed, [Xie Xinmei's Mom] carefully takes care of [Xie Xinmei], looking at her unconscious daughter with a worried expression.
1:19:1|1:19:9|Before long, [Xie Xinmei] finally woke up. She opened her mouth but couldn't make a sound. Xiaojie said to her.
1:19:9|1:19:14|Xie Xinmei, who had just regained consciousness, was very weak. She mustered a bit of hostility and spoke.
1:19:19|1:19:26|Miss Xie Xinmei turned to look in the direction of her school bag, at this moment, she took the towel off her forehead and began to apologize.
1:19:42|1:19:53|Xiaojie finally let go of his hanging heart, he breathed a sigh of relief and looked at the weak [Xie Xinmei] in front of him, feeling nothing but guilt in his heart. So he said to [Xie Xinmei].
1:20:1|1:20:5|Xiaojie looked at the sick [Xie Xinmei], smiled and nodded.
1:20:5|1:20:9|He took [Xie Xinmei]'s hand and then placed a kiss on her forehead.
1:20:9|1:20:13|Xie Xinmei felt comforted by Xiaojie's warm hand and soft lips.
1:20:13|1:20:18|The fatigue and discomfort from days of rushing around disappeared with Xiaojie's company.
1:20:18|1:20:22|[Xie Xinmei] closed her eyes contentedly and gradually fell asleep.
1:20:22|1:20:24|Late at night, [Xie Xinmei] woke up from her dream.
1:20:24|1:20:29|Upon getting up and looking around, Xie Xinmei found that Xiaojie was nowhere to be seen. The room was dark and eerily quiet.
1:20:41|1:20:48|Suddenly, she saw someone in the distance who bore a striking resemblance to Xiaojie, wearing a hat and walking towards the depths of the jungle.
1:20:48|1:20:51|[Xie Xinmei] immediately followed the person's trail, searching around as she walked.
1:20:53|1:20:57|With a glance, [Xie Xinmei] saw Xiaojie standing in the distance.
1:20:57|1:21:5|Xiaojie stood still between the tall and dense trees, hands in pockets, watching as [Xie Xinmei] ran towards her.
1:21:5|1:21:9|Xiaojie, with a mysterious smile on her face, stared at [Xie Xinmei] in front of her.
1:21:9|1:21:12|[Xie Xinmei] subconsciously touched Xiaojie's chest with her hand.
1:21:13|1:21:21|In front of them, Xiaojie turned into thousands of puzzle pieces, continuously breaking and falling from where Xie Xinmei touched.
1:21:21|1:21:28|Panic-stricken [Xie Xinmei] watched as the jigsaw puzzle fell from the sky, quickly trying to catch it with her hands, but she couldn't fix it at all.
1:21:28|1:21:35|Coming to her senses, the scene in front of her suddenly returned to her home, with her father and mother standing hand in hand in front of [Xie Xinmei].
1:21:35|1:21:39|In an instant, the parents in front of me and the surrounding houses turned into countless jigsaw puzzles.
1:21:40|1:21:47|Xie Xinmei rushed towards them with her heart pounding, covering the gap in the puzzle with both hands as the pieces started falling again.
1:21:47|1:21:55|Seeing the pieces falling faster and faster, [Xie Xinmei] quickly picks up the scattered puzzle pieces on the ground, hoping to cover up the missing parts.
1:21:55|1:22:2|Jigsaw puzzle pieces fall heavily, and the devastated [Xie Xinmei] collapses on the ground, watching everything in front of her slowly disappear.
1:22:3|1:22:12|The scene shifts again, this time to the small house where [Xie Xinmei] lived with her grandfather. She sits on the ground motionless, fearing another disaster.
1:22:12|1:22:19|Grandpa sat by the workbench, tapping the wooden hammer in his hand. Hearing Xie Xinmei's call, Grandpa set down his tools and turned towards her.
1:22:20|1:22:26|Looking at [Xie Xinmei] behind her, the two exchanged a knowing smile, and the moment of doubt vanished instantly.
1:22:26|1:22:32|[Xie Xinmei] watched as her grandfather slowly got up from the stool and walked towards her, tears already swirling in her eyes.
1:22:32|1:22:39|Whether it was joy or fear, the body involuntarily trembled slightly, and Grandpa's steps were heavy and powerful.
1:22:39|1:22:45|Watching [Xie Xinmei] kneeling on the ground, a pair of gentle hands reached out and rested on her shoulder, then helped [Xie Xinmei] up.
1:22:48|1:23:0|Xie Xinmei looked at the hand resting on her grandfather's shoulder, then at her grandfather in front of her, with an expression of disbelief on her face. She held onto her grandfather's arm with both hands, doubting and confirming repeatedly.
1:23:1|1:23:6|The familiar warmth, the already collapsed Xiaomei, went straight into her grandfather's arms and burst into tears.
1:23:7|1:23:13|Grandpa gently pats Xie Xinmei with his big hands, comforting the fragile child in his arms.
1:23:13|1:23:20|The first ray of morning sunlight shone into the forest, piercing through the thin mist and slowly awakening the sleeping creatures.
1:23:20|1:23:27|Everything is shrouded in the soft morning light, the jungle and grassland gently bathed in the morning glow.
1:23:27|1:23:31|The sun slowly rises from the ridge, dispersing the mist like steam in the sky.
1:23:33|1:23:39|[Xie Xinmei], lying on the hospital bed, looked pale and weak, a glistening tear sliding down from her closed eyes.
1:23:40|1:23:47|At this moment, [Xie Xinmei] slowly opened her eyes, half-opened eyes carefully scanning the surrounding environment.
1:23:51|1:23:57|Xie Xinmei's Mom, who had been taking care of Xie Xinmei all night, was already exhausted and fell asleep leaning over the sickbed.
1:23:57|1:24:3|The cold hospital room was unusually quiet, with only the just awakened [Xie Xinmei] and her mother [Xie Xinmei's Mom] sleeping soundly by the bed.
1:24:3|1:24:8|Xie Xinmei stared at the only window in the hospital room, lost in thought as a ray of sunlight streamed in.
1:24:9|1:24:14|The scene shifts to the campus, where students gather in small groups.
1:24:14|1:24:27|Xie Xinmei, who was walking towards us, has undergone a great change. She has changed her hairstyle from before, with a calm expression and a smile on her face. She doesn't care at all about the curious looks and discussions of her classmates around her, and walks straight into the classroom, looking straight ahead.
1:24:27|1:24:33|Days passed by, and ever since that incident, Xiaojie also vanished without a trace from her life.
1:24:35|1:24:43|The campus was sunny and filled with laughter, and Xiaojie's unusual experiences were gradually fading away.
1:24:43|1:24:47|Xie Xinmei strives to live each day to the fullest, and her past experiences have become the driving force behind her efforts.
1:26:36|1:26:42|After school, Xie Xinmei pushed open the door and entered the room. She looked around the empty house and finally closed the door.
1:26:45|1:26:52|Xie Xinmei dragged her weary feet, about to take a rest, when she turned around and saw a mysterious letter lying on the table.
1:26:52|1:27:0|She turned on the desk lamp, carefully looked at the letter, which only had the recipient's address and her own home address, without any information about the sender.
1:27:1|1:27:5|Xie Xinmei opened the envelope with confusion, but there was no letter inside.
1:27:5|1:27:10|She shook the envelope again, and this time, a puzzle piece fell out from it.
1:27:10|1:27:19|[Xie Xinmei] picked up the puzzle piece and examined it carefully, only to realize that it was the missing crucial piece from the starry sky puzzle back then, which led her into deep contemplation.
1:27:30|1:27:40|The missing piece of the starry puzzle was finally placed after a long time. Carefully, [Xie Xinmei] filled it in, feeling the joy of regaining what was once lost.
1:27:40|1:27:46|Gently pressing down the puzzle piece, the fingers lingered on it for a long time, and the missing piece was finally found.
1:27:47|1:27:57|The missing starry sky is finally complete, yet [Xie Xinmei] shows no joy. As she looks at the sky in front of her, tears slowly stream down her cheeks.
1:27:57|1:28:0|Time passes, and everything is constantly renewing.
1:28:0|1:28:8|Years later, in Paris, the once dreamy little girl has grown into a graceful young lady.
1:28:8|1:28:13|[Xie Xinmei] stood by the bridge, staring blankly at the bustling crowd in the distance and the busy street full of traffic.
1:28:15|1:28:20|At this moment, a slightly immature voice interrupted her thoughts.
1:28:20|1:28:25|[Xie Xinmei] turned back to look at the little girl calling her, then smiled and nodded in acknowledgment.
1:28:25|1:28:30|Seeing [Xie Xinmei] nodding in agreement, the little girl turned around and walked towards the street artist on the side.
1:28:33|1:28:36|[Xie Xinmei] squats down and speaks to the little girl.
1:28:37|1:28:39|The little girl nodded happily.
1:28:40|1:28:43|Shortly after, [Xie Xinmei] took her hand and left.
1:28:50|1:28:52|Faint singing could be heard suddenly.
1:28:52|1:28:54|[Xie Xinmei] said to her.
1:28:55|1:28:56|The little girl nodded in response.
1:28:57|1:29:4|Xie Xinmei led the little girl to a small street, where the girl looked at rows of decorative lights in awe.
1:29:5|1:29:10|In the center of the square, children in uniform stand together, singing Christmas carols.
1:29:10|1:29:15|The surrounding crowd was filled with onlookers, and the melodious singing was intoxicating.
1:29:15|1:29:20|[Xie Xinmei] was moved by the gentle singing of the little girls as she slowly walked towards the center of the square.
1:29:21|1:29:30|This beautiful singing, like Zhenzhen's teachings, and like Nini's conversations, keeps singing into people's hearts, and sings out from the heart, filling the entire square.
1:29:30|1:29:37|Listening to their singing, a faint smile appeared on the faces of the people around, as if their souls were being cleansed by the music.
1:29:37|1:29:45|At this moment, Xie Xinmei's phone suddenly rang. Seeing the caller ID, she quickly handed it to the little girl and spoke to her in a gentle tone.
1:29:47|1:29:50|The little girl took the phone and exclaimed joyfully.
1:29:50|1:29:56|Mom, after a few simple answers on the phone, the little girl spoke again.
1:29:56|1:30:1|I followed the little girl who was walking away with my sister while we were shopping, [Xie Xinmei] worriedly followed along.
1:30:1|1:30:9|The little girl continued chatting, her sister bought me a lot of gifts, then said goodbye and handed the phone to [Xie Xinmei].
1:30:16|1:30:19|[Xie Xinmei] pulled her sister away from the square, talking as they walked.
1:30:21|1:30:24|After speaking, she glanced at her well-behaved little sister beside her.
1:30:24|1:30:30|Looking up again, large snowflakes fluttered down from the dim sky.
1:30:30|1:30:34|[Xie Xinmei] was captivated by this scene and then picked up the phone to continue talking.
1:30:35|1:30:38|She continued walking while holding her sister's hand.
1:30:44|1:30:49|The younger sister, attracted by something, held [Xie Xinmei]'s hand and stopped in place.
1:30:49|1:30:52|[Xie Xinmei] came to her senses and bent down to speak to her sister.
1:30:57|1:31:2|[Xie Xinmei] looked up at the painting in front of her, then spoke to her mom on the phone.
1:31:6|1:31:14|[Xie Xinmei] hung up the phone, leading her sister into the front window, looking puzzled, staring carefully at the incomplete puzzle in front of her.
1:31:14|1:31:18|The scene cuts to two people pushing open the ancient wooden door and entering the small shop.
1:31:18|1:31:24|As soon as she walked in, Xie Xinmei's little sister was immediately captivated by the strong artistic style of the store, letting out an involuntary exclamation of amazement.
1:31:25|1:31:29|Then he ran off on his own to carefully study the items and boards in the store.
1:31:29|1:31:33|[Xie Xinmei] looked around the unique little shop.
1:31:33|1:31:42|The decoration of her house leans towards the European classical style, with consistent materials, colors, and aesthetics, giving people a sense of traditional historical traces and profound cultural heritage.
1:31:42|1:31:46|[Xie Xinmei] walked slowly, observing every puzzle around her.
1:31:46|1:31:50|It's puzzling that each puzzle is missing the most crucial piece.
1:31:51|1:31:57|[Xie Xinmei] looked at the puzzles, and memories deep in her heart were slowly awakened.
1:31:57|1:32:4|She walked to the shelves, surveying the seemingly casual but cleverly arranged puzzles, deepening her confusion.
