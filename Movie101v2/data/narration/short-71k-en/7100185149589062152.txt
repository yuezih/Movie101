0:0:31|0:0:41|In the messy and chaotic room of the wedding, accompanied by a few dog barks, a middle-aged woman wearing a mask and a nurse's uniform is dragging her feet without any thoughts.
0:0:41|0:0:49|A gentle breeze blew into the room, causing the curtains to sway gently. The few small dogs locked in the cage would occasionally stick out their tongues and look at the woman mopping the floor.
0:0:50|0:0:57|Originally belonged to the neat long hair behind her head, due to continuous movements, a few strands loosened and fell on both sides of her cheeks.
0:0:57|0:1:7|The woman, [Fan Li], however, paid no attention. She stopped what she was doing, took out a bottle of water from her pocket, unscrewed the cap, removed her mask, and started to sip it slowly.
0:1:7|0:1:15|The curtain swayed slightly again at this moment, with the woman leaning on the mop handle and holding a water bottle in one hand, staring blankly ahead.
0:1:16|0:1:27|Suddenly, a slight noise interrupted his thoughts. He quickly stuffed the water bottle back into his pocket and turned to walk down the corridor, only to bump into a curly-haired man holding a large dog.
0:1:27|0:1:43|The middle-aged woman turned out to value a veterinarian, and when she saw the anxious curly-haired man with his dying large dog in his arms, she quickly ushered them into the house and naturally began to administer first aid amidst the dog's barks. In the film, he also has another identity, that of a mother.
0:1:44|0:1:51|The scene shifts to the taxi driver labeled as [Sudan], who is driving in the dimly lit street in light rain.
0:1:51|0:1:56|The dull and humid weather, along with the scarce business, made [Sudan] very irritable.
0:1:56|0:2:2|Fortunately, at this moment, the rain penetrated through the car window, hitting his gray temples, extinguishing the inner irritability.
0:2:2|0:2:9|The good times didn't last long. The congested traffic on a rainy night, along with pedestrians running red lights, once again furrowed his brow.
0:2:10|0:2:24|Sudan suddenly turned the steering wheel, and the taxi stopped in front of a beautifully decorated KTV. As the woman in high heels in the back seat paid and left, she finally put down her arm supporting her forehead, took a refreshing breath, and then left.
0:2:24|0:2:33|On the other side, a boy with short hair and wearing a polo shirt slowly enters the snack street. He walks past an intersection, then quickly turns his head and grabs his companion.
0:2:36|0:2:42|Looking in the direction of his gaze, at the end of the snack street, a long-haired girl was eating with her back to him.
0:2:55|0:3:13|The taxi driver, upon hearing this, had no choice but to step on the gas and accelerate away from the narrow snack street. The boy, [Wu Tao], couldn't wait to shift his gaze away from his father. Little did he know that when he turned back, the girl had already paid and left the spot. The courage that had been built up seemed to deflate like a balloon, disappearing in an instant.
0:3:13|0:3:16|So [Wu Tao] could only stare blankly at the girl's departing figure.
0:3:17|0:3:23|After a moment of silence, Sudan glanced at his companions beside him, then they left the snack street one after another.
0:3:23|0:3:34|On the shiny marble floor, a slender figure of a woman is reflected, perhaps [Fan Li], with her carefully permed and dyed curly hair standing up behind her head with a scarf.
0:3:34|0:3:47|Dressed in a refreshing cheongsam with a leather skirt, highlighting her great figure, she had a leather backpack slung over her left shoulder and a bag of snacks and drinks in her right hand as she walked out of the KTV. There was no one around except for [Wu Tao]'s father's taxi parked outside the door.
0:3:48|0:3:53|After hesitating for a moment, the woman in the leather skirt opened the door to the passenger seat and then crouched down to sit inside.
0:3:53|0:3:58|With the accelerator pedal pressed to the floor, [Wu Tao]'s father quickly drove away with the woman in a leather skirt.
0:3:58|0:4:5|In the early morning at the dock, two workers moored the boat to the shore and started salvaging something under the moonlight.
0:4:5|0:4:9|At this moment, strange noises could be heard coming from the road by the shore.
0:4:10|0:4:21|Sudan and Fan Li looked up at the shore, a taxi mixed with a piercing brake sound, unexpectedly drove straight into the river, after high-speed crashing through the guardrail on the shore, it uncontrollably fell into the river.
0:4:21|0:4:34|Two workers were directly frightened by what they saw in front of them, standing helplessly by the dark river, with the brightly lit crane in the distance, but the small movement could not attract much attention.
0:4:35|0:4:50|Several days later, in the hospital, a patient with a newly fitted leg brace on his left leg slowly woke up from the bed. The monitoring device beeped softly, indicating that the patient was fine, but the following scene still made people sigh involuntarily.
0:4:51|0:5:11|The patient is the woman in the leather skirt. Her once beautiful face is now covered in scars, with thick bandages on her forehead. As she carefully props herself up on her elbows and sits up from the bed, her previously confused eyes focus intently on her left calf. She cautiously tries to move it, but soon realizes something is wrong.
0:5:23|0:5:27|Upon seeing this, [Doctor] and the nurse hurried into the room.
0:5:27|0:5:31|The doctor first supported [Sudan]'s body and then examined his left lower leg, which was raised high.
0:5:31|0:5:34|Subsequently, [Sudan] walked out of the ward with his hands in his pockets, leisurely.
0:5:34|0:5:39|On the other side, a cordon had already been set up at the location where the car fell off the dock.
0:5:39|0:5:41|The police are using a crane to salvage operations.
0:5:42|0:5:47|Before long, a taxi with a deformed body slowly emerged from the water.
0:5:47|0:5:56|With the help of a crane, water is continuously seeping out from the body of the car, the severely damaged front of the car also occasionally dropping fragments.
0:5:56|0:6:3|Despite the cordon set up on the shore, curious citizens still gathered around, pointing and chatting about the taxi.
0:6:3|0:6:11|Before long, the taxi was hoisted ashore. In the opening scene of the story, the middle-aged veterinarian, [Fan Li], also arrived at the salvage site under police escort.
0:6:12|0:6:23|The two of them looked up at the taxi in the hazy sky, unable to say a word for a long time. But the embroidered patches on their clothes seemed to still reveal the trace of Dad Xiaochuan.
0:6:23|0:6:29|At this moment, a strong wind blew through, causing the taxi to sway in the air and making the mother and son squint their eyes.
0:6:31|0:6:48|Finally, the taxi slowly landed on the ground, the crane returned to its place, and the police stood silently not far away. However, the mother and son still faced [Jiang Feng], staring at the taxi in silence, allowing the crowd on the shore to watch.
0:6:48|0:6:55|The commotion by the shore quickly attracted many strong men with shovels for farming.
0:7:1|0:7:8|A man walked past the mother and son, answered firmly, and then walked towards the river with a long pole.
0:7:17|0:7:31|In the midst of the conversation, [Sudan's mother] had already followed the man to the riverside. She handed over a photo of Sudan's father to him, while bowing respectfully. Meanwhile, [Sudan] remained in place, gazing at the boats passing by on the river lost in thought.
0:7:31|0:7:45|After Sudan finished her plea, the mother and son boarded the small boat heading to the other side. On the simple boat, there was a family of four planning to travel together, as well as farmers going out to work. Fan Li looked at the rushing river and whispered softly.
0:7:51|0:8:6|Lying on the railing, [Wu Tao] listened, turned his head to look at his mother, then shifted his gaze to the river, pursed his lips, wanting to say something, but then stopped himself, and then shifted his gaze to the surging river in front of him.
0:8:6|0:8:13|[Su Dan] was surprised to see a small opening cut through the river surface, while the wonders among the mountains confused his eyes.
0:8:16|0:8:29|The character [Sudan], wearing a hospital gown, was originally lying on the hospital bed with her head tilted, staring blankly. The thick bandage on her forehead was removed as the wound healed. Upon hearing the nurse's voice, she slowly straightened her head and her gaze moved dazedly towards the foot of the bed.
0:8:29|0:8:41|Upon seeing that the newcomer was [Mrs. Xiao Chuan], Sudan first pursed his already cracked lips, then with the help of the nurse, slowly propped up his upper body and leaned against the head of the bed. His originally lifeless eyes were now instantly filled with tears.
0:8:42|0:8:54|[Sudan] clenched his teeth and gripped the bedsheet tightly, controlling himself to prevent tears from falling.
0:8:54|0:9:4|Mom Xiao Chuan stood in front of [Sudan], looking at her injured appearance, and the words she originally wanted to say suddenly stuck in her throat.
0:9:4|0:9:11|[Sudan] just took the water cup handed by the nurse and handed it back to the other person.
0:9:19|0:9:26|Standing on the other side of the bed, Sudan, upon hearing the nurse's words, quickly dropped his arms that were originally held in front of his chest, staring with wide eyes as the nurse walked away.
0:9:28|0:9:35|After saying these words, [Sudan] left the ward fiercely, leaving two women awkwardly facing each other in front of the sickbed.
0:9:35|0:9:50|Early the next morning, as promised, Little River's mother, [Fan Li], asked Little River to come to the hospital to take care of [Sudan]. She brought a plastic basin from outside and handed it to him when she reached [Sudan], then quickly turned her head, resting one arm on the end of the bed and looking out the window.
0:9:50|0:9:56|After a refreshing sigh, the sound of gurgling water instantly filled the small hospital room.
0:10:2|0:10:6|[Sudan] took the basin with his right hand and placed it under him, but his eyes were fixed firmly on the creek.
0:10:11|0:10:15|Xiao Chuan lowered his head, expressionless, and responded impatiently.
0:10:18|0:10:22|[Sudan] took the tissue from the bedside and rolled it up, then reached into the covers.
0:10:32|0:10:39|Upon hearing the call from [Sudan], the originally dazed Xiao Chuan finally turned around, looked at the other person, and then slowly walked towards the edge of the bed.
0:10:39|0:10:47|[Sudan] was holding a plastic basin at this moment, gesturing for Xiao Chuan to take it. The empty basin was quickly filled with liquid.
0:10:48|0:10:52|But after he took it, [Sudan] said with a smile.
0:10:52|0:11:4|Watching Xiaochuan holding a plastic basin, looking awkward, [Sudan] couldn't help but laugh, but as she laughed, her upturned mouth suddenly drooped, and there seemed to be a flicker in her eyes.
0:11:4|0:11:14|He quickly turned his head towards the side of the sickbed, blocking Sudan's curious gaze. Seeing this, Sudan had to pick up the plastic basin in his hand and turn to look out the window.
0:11:14|0:11:25|It was late at night. Sudan returned home from the ward and took out a toolbox from under his bed. He carefully held it and sat down at the desk.
0:11:25|0:11:31|On the simple desk made of thick tree branches, old computers and various study supplies are neatly arranged.
0:11:32|0:11:49|Xiao Chuan, however, was not in the mood for anything else at the moment. He sat in the main chair and opened the lid of the toolbox, taking out three small colorful clay figures. Upon closer inspection, one was a short middle-aged man with a beer belly, and the other was a middle-aged woman in a nurse's uniform.
0:11:49|0:11:52|The last one doesn't seem to have the color applied like the first two.
0:11:53|0:11:59|Sudan, with short hair and wearing a revealing top, looks somewhat like Xiao Chuan.
0:11:59|0:12:9|After thinking for a while, he took out a utility knife from the toolbox and, under the dim desk lamp, meticulously carved the figure's features on the desk.
0:12:9|0:12:14|Under the dilapidated old eaves, only the warm summer night breeze accompanies the earnestly carved teenager under the light.
0:12:41|0:12:51|At this moment, [Sudan] also slowly woke up, feeling the boy's actions, he just opened his eyes, although expressionless, he did not speak to stop him.
0:13:2|0:13:6|The bank teller is explaining to [Fan Li]'s mother.
0:13:12|0:13:23|Hearing that it would take two years to get the money, [Sudan] helplessly smirked at the bank teller, then stuffed the policy into her bag and left the insurance company.
0:13:23|0:13:31|Sudan then arrived at a processing factory, where a worker was carefully welding materials together to assemble a new wheelchair.
0:13:31|0:13:38|In no time, the mobility aid that originally had a footrest on the left side of the wheelchair was transformed into a brand new look with a support bar on the left side.
0:13:40|0:13:45|After the master stopped, [Sudan]'s mother couldn't wait to sit down and experience it first.
0:13:45|0:13:51|After sitting down, the entire left leg can be stretched straight and placed on the support bar, with very stable movement.
0:14:5|0:14:8|Mother Xiao sits on the hospital bed and says to [Sudan].
0:14:8|0:14:12|[Sudan] looked at Mrs. Xiaochuan incredulously.
0:14:27|0:14:34|Sudan is sitting in a wheelchair, talking and bouncing around.
0:14:34|0:14:40|Mrs. Xiaochuan paid no attention to Sudan's sarcasm, but nervously fiddled with her left leg on the wheelchair.
0:14:42|0:14:49|In the bustling and crowded market, middle-aged men with their collars open due to the heat can be seen everywhere.
0:14:49|0:14:56|The bustling cries of the vendors never ceased, causing many middle-aged women who came to buy vegetables to become red-faced due to the prices.
0:14:56|0:15:2|The thick-skinned watermelon is sliced with a knife, splashing juice everywhere, making people crave for a piece immediately.
0:15:3|0:15:12|At this moment, Xiao Chuan's mother pushed [Sudan] in a wheelchair to the street corner, looking at the crowded crowd, she had to cautiously move forward with a stiff upper lip.
0:15:12|0:15:21|Occasionally bumping into a few neighbors on the way, Sudan still nods and greets them.
0:15:21|0:15:26|As they went deeper and encountered more people, [Ma Dongmei] had to speak up and ask the passersby to make way.
0:15:29|0:15:39|The wheelchair stopped on a long street, [Sudan] turned back and demanded from [Fan Li], but [Fan Li] silently refused.
0:15:39|0:15:46|Sudan, supported by Xiao Chuan Mama, carefully lifted her from the wheelchair, placed her arm on her shoulder, and walked towards the steps.
0:15:50|0:15:57|Reluctantly, [Wu Tao] had to fold up the wheelchair and walk behind the two with a cane, staggering.
0:15:57|0:16:3|However, with just one glance, a slender waist of [Sudan] was revealed along with the swaying posture.
0:16:3|0:16:12|The boy's eyes uncontrollably continued to look down, under his short skirt were a pair of fresh and tender legs in paper bracelet stockings. With a dry mouth, he quickly lowered his head and swallowed his saliva.
0:16:17|0:16:22|[Xiao Chuan] exerted force to place the wheelchair on the platform at the top of the steps.
0:16:22|0:16:24|[Ma Chuan] quickly helped [Sudan] sit in the wheelchair.
0:16:31|0:16:38|[Ma Dongmei] greeted the neighbors while pushing the wheelchair towards the end of the alley.
0:16:38|0:16:44|[Sudan] casually brushed her waist-length hair with one hand, enjoying [Xiao Chuan]'s mother's service without a care in the world.
0:16:44|0:16:48|Turning a corner, [Xiao Chuan] arrived in the corridor filled with mahjong tables.
0:16:48|0:16:55|Wearing a cool outfit, [Sudan] quickly caught the attention of a group of shirtless old men.
0:16:57|0:17:9|[Ma Dongmei]'s mother answered while pushing the wheelchair, continuing to walk deeper into the distance.
0:17:9|0:17:13|In front of a dusty wooden cabinet, the three characters stopped moving forward.
0:17:13|0:17:17|Afterwards, [Wu Tao] cautiously entered the room.
0:17:22|0:17:30|After cooking in the greasy alley, the three of them sat around in the shabby living room, eating the most ordinary meal.
0:17:30|0:17:36|Xiao Chuan took a bite and then put down the chopsticks.
0:17:48|0:17:54|Xiao Chuan's mother spit out the bone from her mouth and gently placed it on the dining table.
0:17:54|0:18:0|Then, he asked the same question again, unwilling to let it go.
0:18:0|0:18:3|Xiao Chuan glanced at the dishes in the bowl and replied with a drop.
0:18:4|0:18:8|Speak up, and quickly shovel the food into your mouth in big bites.
0:18:8|0:18:15|Mom Xiao Chuan paused with the chopsticks reaching for the plate of food, turned her head to look at Xiao Chuan, and then said.
0:18:19|0:18:27|After whispering, Xiaochuan's mother picked up the chopsticks again and carefully moved the dishes in the bowl. At this moment, [Sudan] slowly put down the bowl.
0:18:29|0:18:33|After speaking, [Sudan] gently wheeled away.
0:18:37|0:18:52|[Sudan], who had already leisurely walked to the door, heard this and made an effort to turn around, walking back towards the living room.
0:18:52|0:18:59|Watching [Sudan] slowly walk towards the sofa in the living room, which had long been exposed to cotton, [Fan Li] said calmly.
0:18:59|0:19:2|But [Sudan] had already laid down on the sofa.
0:19:10|0:19:15|[Wu Tao], who was eating, had to put down his chopsticks and pick up a cane from the wheelchair to walk to [Sudan]'s side.
0:19:18|0:19:27|After leaning the cane against the coffee table, carefully lifting the left leg of [Sudan], then embracing her waist and slowly standing up.
0:19:27|0:19:31|Finally, he handed her the cane and they supported each other as they walked to the restroom.
0:19:31|0:19:41|Upon entering the bathroom, [Wu Tao] quickly lifted the toilet seat, then took the crutch with one hand and held [Sudan]'s right arm with the other, slowly helping her sit on the toilet.
0:19:42|0:19:48|[Wu Tao] also slowed down his eating, his eyes occasionally glancing towards the direction of the restroom.
0:19:48|0:19:55|After seeing [Sudan] settle down, [Wu Tao] brought a chair from the living room and then lifted her left leg and placed it on top.
0:19:57|0:20:2|A piercing train whistle woke the city up to a new day.
0:20:2|0:20:12|The mist blended with the steam of the train as it passed through the suburban intersection. Early workers had to stop and watch as the clanging train slowly departed.
0:20:12|0:20:29|Near the railway tracks, amidst the chaotic factories, various rusty gas pipelines were dripping. Abandoned waste continued to be discharged into the sky from the dilapidated factory buildings. In the living room, [Sudan] was awakened by the sound of the train whistle, then he stretched his arms and yawned.
0:20:35|0:20:41|Impatiently, [Sudan] quickly propped up his upper body, attempting to awaken the mother and son with his voice.
0:20:41|0:20:57|After a long wait with no response, [Sudan] carefully moved his left leg and slowly sat up from the sofa. He fumbled to put on his right slipper, then twisted his body, propping himself up on the sofa armrests with both arms, and finally stood up slowly with one foot.
0:20:57|0:21:1|Seeing the wheelchair across the coffee table, [Sudan] lightly hopped over to the bookcase next to the sofa.
0:21:2|0:21:15|After safely sitting in the wheelchair, [Sudan] quickly lifted his left leg with both hands onto the footrest, took big breaths, and then slowly wheeled towards the window in the living room.
0:21:15|0:21:30|The sunlight outside the house shone through the curtains into the room. [Sudan] came to the window, carefully supporting his weight with his right leg to stand up, then steadied himself on the window frame and opened it. However, the next moment, he was stunned by what he saw in front of him.
0:21:31|0:21:39|In the early morning, the sun was pulled to the distant mountains, but the thick clouds blocked the light in an instant.
0:21:39|0:21:47|[Sudan] looked to the right front, the neatly arranged small trees, under the moistening of the morning dew, were confidently displaying their dazzling power.
0:22:2|0:22:8|The next moment, the sunlight suddenly pierced through the clouds and shot straight towards the bridge.
0:22:8|0:22:17|At this moment, [Sudan] sat back in the wheelchair, kicking the door with each step. Failing to open it, he then turned towards another door.
0:22:17|0:22:25|Unfortunately, just like before, no one came to answer this time, so he could only keep retreating in his wheelchair in the narrow room.
0:22:27|0:22:33|However, with one careless step, Sudan turned the corner and bumped his left foot straight into the wooden cabinet in the corner.
0:22:33|0:22:40|At this moment, by the bustling river, [Xiao Chuan] is standing at the taxi drop-off point, staring intently at the river surface.
0:22:40|0:22:46|In front of him, as one cargo ship after another passed by, [Xiao Chuan] stood there staring blankly for a long time.
0:22:46|0:22:49|At this moment, a girl ran down from the minibus and patted him on the back.
0:22:50|0:22:56|The sudden movement startled [Wu Tao], almost causing him to lose his balance and fall off the dock.
0:22:56|0:23:1|He then came to his senses and ran with the girl to the minibus behind them.
0:23:1|0:23:8|The girl in question is the same one from the previous snack stall, the spotted one that made [Sudan] retreat lightly.
0:23:8|0:23:11|They then took a vehicle to the other side of the river.
0:23:11|0:23:18|The sunlight spilled over the vast river surface, and the waves created by the cruise ship instantly made it shimmer with millions of sparkling ripples.
0:23:19|0:23:28|Gently watching [Wu Tao] sitting helplessly on the reef, [Fan Li] bent down and sat beside him after some thought. After looking at the river surface under their feet, she spoke.
0:23:33|0:23:37|[Xiao Chuan] heard this and snapped out of his daze, turning to look at [Qingqing].
0:23:41|0:23:46|At this moment, a boy on the shore shouted at the two of them,
0:23:46|0:23:52|Speaking, the boy who had changed into swimming trunks jumped straight into the river.
0:23:52|0:23:55|[Xiao Chuan] put away his melancholy mood and quickly stood up from the rocks.
0:23:57|0:24:2|Gently hearing the boy's urging, [Fan Li] also smiled and followed [Wu Tao] down the reef.
0:24:2|0:24:10|After a moment, [Wu Tao] took off his long pants and Polo shirt, sat on the rocks by the shore, and slowly moved towards the river.
0:24:10|0:24:17|Watching the surging river water, he first tested it with his foot, then walked aimlessly towards the right. 
0:24:17|0:24:20|Gently facing the sunlight, wearing short sleeves and sweatpants.
0:24:20|0:24:25|Before long, the girl, with only her underwear left, appeared in front of Xiao Chuan.
0:24:26|0:24:30|The character Sudan, with skin as white as jade, exudes a faint fragrance of youth.
0:24:30|0:24:40|Continuing, [Fan Li] gently placed his clothes, pants, and glasses on the edge of the reef. After looking back at [Wu Tao] and giving him a smile, he then jumped straight into the river.
0:24:40|0:24:48|Watching his companions jump into the river one after another, [Sudan] suddenly closed his eyes and resolutely followed in their footsteps, leaping down as well.
0:24:48|0:24:56|The happy time always passes quickly. As the sun has set, the three of them put on their clothes, got into the car they came in, and headed home. 
0:25:6|0:25:17|The boy was driving the minibus, while Sudan stood behind Qingqing with both hands holding the rings on both sides, looking at her half-wet hair draped over her shoulders with a silly smile.
0:25:17|0:25:21|Ke Qingqing, however, cast her gaze towards the boy driving the car.
0:25:21|0:25:28|Finally, watching Qingqing's hands placed on the pull-up bar, Sudan summoned up the courage this time and placed his right hand on the back of the other's hand.
0:25:34|0:25:42|Hearing Qingqing's angry voice, Xiaochen quickly withdrew his hand, and the boy also turned back to look at Qingqing in surprise.
0:25:42|0:25:48|Qingqing stared at the boy with a serious expression, and he had no choice but to slowly step on the brake.
0:25:48|0:25:53|Seeing the door open, [Fan Li] quickly dropped the pull ring and got off the minibus.
0:25:53|0:25:59|At a construction site filled with steel frames, [Fan Li] carried her school bag and walked away angrily.
0:26:0|0:26:6|The vehicle restarted, with [Wu Tao] sitting dejectedly in the back row, gritting his teeth and sighing repeatedly.
0:26:6|0:26:10|Before long, the car stopped next to the factory building at the railway crossing.
0:26:22|0:26:28|Hearing the boy's derogatory words, [Sudan] frowned and left without looking back.
0:26:28|0:26:36|But the boy seemed to want to prove himself right. Just as [Sudan] took a step away, he suddenly stepped on the gas pedal and returned to the spot where Qingqing had temporarily gotten off the car.
0:26:38|0:26:50|Unexpectedly, in a place that was originally deserted, [Fan Li] emerged from behind a pile of steel pipes. Upon seeing the familiar minibus, she stood directly in the middle of the road, waiting for the vehicle to stop.
0:26:50|0:27:3|At this moment, the boy turned on the car lights and when he saw Qingqing in front of him, he smirked slightly, smiled at her, then pressed a switch and nodded his head, indicating something. After Qingqing got into the car, he quickly closed the door and drove away from the scene.
0:27:5|0:27:12|At this moment, in [Xiao Chuan]'s home, [Sudan] is leaning against the back of the sofa, lifting both legs and swaying them in the air.
0:27:12|0:27:17|Dejected [Xiao Chuan] opened the door and saw the following scene through the plastic door curtain.
0:27:18|0:27:28|[Sudan] placed his left leg on the coffee table, bent his right leg, and slightly curled up his five toes, then slowly put on a thin long stocking.
0:27:28|0:27:39|After putting on a long sock tightly above the knee, [Sudan] took out a fishnet stocking and slipped it on from the foot, slowly gliding up to the calf, finally tying it into an exquisite bow at the root of the thigh.
0:27:40|0:27:48|Later, she satisfactorily rubbed her right leg with both hands, and when she turned her head, she saw [Xiao Chuan] separated by a plastic door curtain outside the room.
0:27:48|0:27:54|Feeling uneasy about peeking, [Wu Tao] returned to his room, sitting on the bed, covering his breath.
0:27:55|0:27:58|Sudan rolled his wheelchair to a stop in front of her door.
0:28:3|0:28:8|When [Sudan] saw [Fan Li] approaching, he touched her hand with his raised left foot.
0:28:13|0:28:21|[Chuan]’s hand touched [Sudan]’s toes, quickly backing away, but the occasional shaking of his legs still stirred the young man's heartstrings.
0:28:21|0:28:29|But in the end, [Sudan] did not immediately agree. A few days later, [Fan Li], [Wu Tao], and the boy met up again to go out and play.
0:28:29|0:28:40|The boys and girls walked aimlessly along the railway tracks, facing the morning dew. But as they walked, the group that was originally walking side by side gradually left only [Sudan] walking at the front.
0:28:41|0:28:48|At this moment, Sudan gently stepped onto the narrow iron rails, with Fan Li quickly moving to his side, showing a protective gesture.
0:28:57|0:29:2|A few days later, Xiao Chuan pushed [Sudan] and followed the salvager to the riverbank.
0:29:2|0:29:9|Before long, the master stopped at the dock and then gestured for Sudan and Fan Li to come forward together.
0:29:9|0:29:15|With a slight hesitation, Sudan saw the master lift his foot and walk towards the body on the shore.
0:29:15|0:29:20|So he had to stop pushing [Sudan] and slowly walked towards the riverbank.
0:29:20|0:29:26|Before getting closer, Sudan and Fan Li saw a mother and son holding a woven belt, running towards the body floating in the river.
0:29:28|0:29:37|Watching her already swollen loved one, the mother in this mother-son duo, has lost control of her emotions, with the sound of sorrowful wailing echoing incessantly.
0:29:37|0:29:43|The men from the shore salvage team quickly pulled the woman away from the corpse.
0:29:43|0:29:49|[Sudan], sitting not far away, watched the scene in front of him and couldn't help but lower his head, breathing heavily.
0:29:49|0:29:56|At this moment, Xiaochuan slowly turned back to [Sudan]'s side, walking while caressing his chest and abdomen.
0:29:57|0:30:9|Hearing the woman's heart-wrenching cry, coupled with the damp and foul smell brought by the river wind behind her, she finally couldn't bear the physical and psychological pressure anymore, and knelt down in pain and vomited.
0:30:10|0:30:16|Spitting out vigorously on the ground, Sudan felt a bit relieved in body and seemed to have cleared up his mind a lot.
0:30:16|0:30:22|Shortly after, [Sudan] spat to the side, slowly got up, clapped his hands, and stood up.
0:30:22|0:30:28|Then, after wiping his mouth casually, [Fan Li] staggered over and stood in front of Sudan.
0:30:32|0:30:42|Watching little Chuan, who was smiling foolishly and feeling lucky that his father didn't die, [Sudan] propped up his chin with one hand, lips tightly closed, furrowing his brows, and stared at him motionlessly under the scorching sun.
0:30:42|0:30:56|After returning from the riverside, Sudan, who couldn't fall asleep for a long time, arrived at an abandoned car factory in the early hours of the morning. Remembering the bloated corpse, he now wandered alone among various scrapped vehicles in the cold moonlight.
0:30:56|0:31:3|He opened the prepared flashlight to illuminate the front, while feeling the car body to boost his courage. 
0:31:3|0:31:9|After stepping over a metal plate, [Sudan] finally found the target he was looking for.
0:31:9|0:31:12|At this moment, fear also dissipates into nothingness.
0:31:12|0:31:18|Although the taxi in front of them had a deformed driver's side door panel and a completely wrecked front end.
0:31:18|0:31:22|But [Wu Tao] recognized it at a glance, this was the taxi that his father used to drive.
0:31:23|0:31:46|He quickly bypassed the car body, got into the passenger seat, and illuminated the interior of the driver's seat at close range. He first straightened his body to touch the broken front windshield, then knocked on the front storage box, and unexpectedly found that the car key inside had not been pulled out.
0:31:46|0:31:50|[As soon as Sudan turned the key, a melodious sound poured out from the stereo.]
0:31:54|0:32:5|The soothing and beautiful melody instantly relaxed him, but the not-so-quiet movement still attracted the barking of the stray dogs in the parking lot.
0:32:5|0:32:17|But [Sudan] had no reaction to this. Suddenly, a beam of light pierced through the night, it turned out to be a tear slowly sliding down his face in the moonlight. And so, he sat there motionless for who knows how long.
0:32:20|0:32:26|The next morning, [Wu Tao] pushed [Sudan] to the unfinished bridge early in the morning.
0:32:26|0:32:32|In front of a spacious open space, he was dancing wildly to the music. 
0:32:32|0:32:42|The young Sudan exerted all his strength, swinging his limbs freely in the air without any restraint, as the thick fog enveloped them, sweat mingling with dew.
0:32:42|0:32:46|A cool morning breeze blew through, carrying the melody away after it had finished playing.
0:32:47|0:32:53|[Su Dan] slowly closed his eyes and let himself immerse in the gentle melody once again.
0:32:53|0:33:1|Jumping without direction, without focus, more like without a home, as if the soul had long been abandoned along with the song.
0:33:1|0:33:6|Watching from a distance, [Sudan] saw this and bent down to press pause, opening the DVD player.
0:33:8|0:33:11|Xiao Chuan, hands on knees, responded upon hearing this.
0:33:27|0:33:35|Sudan, who had been staring motionless at Xiao Chuan, slowly turned his head upon hearing this, then bent down and pressed the button on the CD player again.
0:33:39|0:33:45|Hearing the music start up again, [Fan Li] once again vigorously waved his limbs.
0:33:45|0:33:50|But the words he just mustered up the courage to say seemed to have drained all his strength.
0:33:50|0:33:57|The once powerful punches and earth-shattering kicks gradually lost their strength, swaying weakly.
0:33:57|0:34:4|[Sudan] sat quietly in the distance, watching the teenager vent his emotions bit by bit without saying a word.
0:34:4|0:34:8|At the other end of the house, Sudan's mother was sitting on the toilet, lost in thought.
0:34:9|0:34:24|With one hand holding a roll of toilet paper and the other holding a plastic stick-like object, the faucet in the distance was dripping continuously. Sudan, who was always careful with money, showed no reaction and kept staring at the plastic stick with a furrowed brow.
0:34:24|0:34:31|After coming out of the bathroom, [Fan Li] walked into the living room, picked up a glass and took a few big sips. She then looked up at the wall in front of her.
0:34:33|0:34:40|The wall's plaster had long been soaked and peeled off, but the portrait of [Xiao Chuan's father] on the wall still smiled brilliantly.
0:34:43|0:34:51|[Fan Li] kept muttering in her mouth and the next second, she unexpectedly returned to the pet hospital at the beginning of the film.
0:34:51|0:34:59|She gently caressed the big dog on the sickbed, but the hollow look in her eyes seemed to foreshadow the dog's fate.
0:34:59|0:35:6|The curly-haired man [Wu Tao], who is a dog owner, couldn't help but knock on the wall upon hearing the urgent and difficult sounds.
0:35:10|0:35:16|He then stormed into the ward and stood at the door, loudly reprimanding [Fan Li].
0:35:24|0:35:33|Upon hearing the accusations from [Wu Tao], [Fan Li] could no longer hold back. The tears that had been welling up in her eyes rolled down her face and fell into her mask.
0:35:33|0:35:44|Sudan turned around and sat weakly on the chair, then took off the mask and headgear, bent down and buried her face in her legs.
0:35:44|0:35:46|[Wu Tao] awkwardly pulled out a few pieces of paper.
0:35:50|0:35:55|Sitting next to [Fan Li], he handed her the paper.
0:35:55|0:36:2|Xiao Chuan's mother, [Fan Li], took the tissue but showed no intention of wiping her tears. She just sat on the stool, crying helplessly.
0:36:2|0:36:12|Xiao Yi was at a loss for a moment, looked at Xiao Chuan's mother, then touched his nose and spoke.
0:36:12|0:36:14|After speaking, he glanced at Mrs. Xiaochuan.
0:36:21|0:36:28|The moment the words fell, Sudan, who had already calmed down, suddenly gasped again.
0:36:28|0:36:32|The crying quickly elicited responses from the other puppies in the ward.
0:36:32|0:36:37|Mother Xiao Chuan reached out and held her hand on her thigh, releasing her emotions drop by drop.
0:36:39|0:36:45|Late at night, as a large truck roared by, Sudan gradually came to her senses upon hearing Xiaoyi's question.
0:36:45|0:36:48|She then calmed her breathing and spoke.
0:37:6|0:37:16|Mrs. Xiaochuan seemed to have suffered a great deal of grievances. The pent-up emotions since her husband left were unleashed on [Wu Tao], this unfamiliar and young man, in full force.
0:37:18|0:37:28|Watching the woman next to him crying constantly, [Wu Tao] first put the tissue in his hand back on the table behind him, then adjusted his pocket and took out a piece of paper before speaking again.
0:37:36|0:37:42|It turned out to be a business card, which [Fan Li] then handed to Xiao Chuan's mother.
0:37:42|0:37:47|Xiao Chuan's mother unconsciously clenched the business card in her hand, and her emotions gradually calmed down.
0:37:47|0:37:54|A few days later, under the scorching sun, [Fan Li] drove a small car slowly from the narrow lane.
0:37:54|0:38:0|Sudan parked the car, got out and walked straight towards the waiting Xiaochuan's mother in the distance.
0:39:6|0:39:8|Xiao Yi said earnestly.
0:39:8|0:39:11|Shortly after, the two of them left the health center.
0:39:11|0:39:18|Xiao Yi is driving with Xiao Chuan's mother on the highway to prove the importance of psychological intervention.
0:39:18|0:39:25|The windows were all rolled down, the music was turned up to the maximum, and the two people sitting in the front row were enjoying the thrill of the high-speed driving.
0:39:25|0:39:28|The car finally stopped under a deserted tree shade.
0:39:28|0:39:34|Then you... Xiao Yi turned to Xiao Chun's mother, placing one hand on the back of the seat behind her.
0:39:41|0:39:44|The mother on the boat spoke to the door of the car.
0:39:44|0:39:46|Xiao Yi then reached out and touched her shoulder.
0:39:46|0:39:49|Sudan looked down with a lowered brow at the little Yi who was close by.
0:40:7|0:40:28|As soon as the words fell, [Xiao Yi] stood up and pressed [Xiao Chuan's mother] down with force.
0:40:28|0:40:34|[Ms. Xiao Chuan] held onto the seatbelt, watching [Xiao Yi] dangling above her, and couldn't help but burst into laughter.
0:40:39|0:40:50|When it comes to it, [Xiao Yi] quickly sits back in the driver's seat.
0:40:50|0:40:55|In order to ease the awkwardness, [Sudan] and [Fan Li] walked shoulder to shoulder through the woods towards the direction of the observation deck.
0:40:57|0:41:1|Looking at the setting sun in front of her, [Fan Li] sighed and spoke.
0:41:1|0:41:5|Without the boldness just now, she simply turned her head to the other side.
0:41:13|0:41:30|[Mrs. Xiao] did not respond to [Xiao Yi]'s answer just now, but the mention of pregnancy made [Xiao Yi] slightly uneasy. His hands, which were originally hanging by his sides, were now tucked into his pants pockets. And so, the two of them stood on the observation deck, gazing at the river in the distance for a long, long time.
0:41:42|0:41:44|Masato Ogawa stood behind him, folding clothes.
0:41:48|0:41:57|After speaking, she neatly folded the clothes one by one and placed them in the living room wardrobe, while [Sudan] stared out the window, motionless.
0:41:57|0:42:5|In the turbulent river in the distance, a person was struggling desperately with both hands raised high above their head.
0:42:5|0:42:13|At this moment, [Sudan] regained consciousness, mechanically stuffing sunflower seeds into his mouth, then unconsciously spitting out the shells.
0:42:20|0:42:27|Xiao Chuan put on a coat at this moment, stood in front of the mirror full of anticipation, and smiled slightly at the reflection in the mirror.
0:42:27|0:42:32|Outside the house, an ambulance roared past, with [Sudan] leaning against the window, staring blankly.
0:42:37|0:42:42|This sentence quickly awakens [Sudan] from his daze, and he turns his head to look behind him.
0:42:42|0:42:51|Xiao Chuan unexpectedly put on a suit. The thin body of the boy naturally couldn't fill out the oversized clothes, and [Sudan] spat out a watermelon seed shell after seeing it.
0:42:51|0:42:59|At night, [Sudan] first slices the pork belly, cuts the scallions and chili into shreds, then heats the wok and stir-fries them in order, flipping them left and right.
0:43:2|0:43:8|Then let Sudan season it, and when it's about to be served, hand a pair of chopsticks to Sudan.
0:43:8|0:43:14|After adjusting the seasoning to taste, [Sudan] scooped the dishes into the plate, including the slightly curled pork belly.
0:43:26|0:43:35|Xiao Chuan's mother walked from the bedroom to the table, casually tied her hair back with a hair tie, then picked up the wine on the table and returned to the kitchen.
0:43:35|0:43:42|Three of them were quietly eating when suddenly Xiao Chuan picked up a piece of meat and put it into [Ma Dongmei]'s bowl.
0:44:4|0:44:10|[Sudan]'s sudden voice made the mother and son stop their actions, then they both looked at him in unison.
0:44:10|0:44:16|But he acted as if he hadn't seen anything, picking the dishes from the plate and eating them greedily in big mouthfuls.
0:44:16|0:44:24|But Xiao Chuan began to chew vigorously at this point to express his dissatisfaction.
0:44:24|0:44:25|Mom Xiao Chuan couldn't help but start scolding him.
0:44:30|0:44:39|Xiao Chuan paused at this, stopped eating for a moment, glanced at his mother, and then quickly shoveled a few bites of food into his mouth.
0:44:39|0:44:46|Continuing to stare straight at her mother, [Fan Li] chewed harder and even started shaking her head provocatively.
0:44:58|0:45:4|Sudan quickly used chopsticks to tap on Xiaochuan's head, sensing that Xiaochuan's mother, who was about to explode, was about to erupt.
0:45:4|0:45:10|Xiao Chuan was also stunned by this sudden lesson, so he had to lower his head and eat his rice obediently.
0:45:12|0:45:17|After eating in peace, Sudan lay on the table, looking lifelessly at the books in front of him.
0:45:17|0:45:25|The scene where [Sudan] under the table lightly taps her own calf with a high heel, while all she can think of is being reprimanded.
0:45:25|0:45:30|Outside the house, [Sudan] is carefully tying the shoelace of her high heels with her injured left foot.
0:45:30|0:45:35|Unfortunately, Sudan's left calf injury had not fully healed, causing the high heel she was holding to fall from the air.
0:45:36|0:45:46|Xiaochuan heard a sound outside the house, and when he looked up, he saw a slender and tender long leg, followed by a glimpse of fishnet stockings extending to the thigh root of [Sudan].
0:45:46|0:45:55|But [Sudan], as if unaware of being watched, once again let her high heels fall off and simply propped up her legs straight into the air.
0:46:2|0:46:14|Before long, the vibrant colors in the living room were completely shut out, but the sounds of repression, joy, and what seemed like pain still seeped through the crack in the door and into the young man's bedroom.
0:46:14|0:46:22|In a daze, Sudan put on the diving goggles at some point, then he slowly sat up from the bed and groped his way towards the bedroom door.
0:46:23|0:46:35|Due to the goggles covering his nose, the lenses quickly fogged up, causing Xiao Chuan to unconsciously reach out with his hands and slowly walk out of the bedroom.
0:46:35|0:46:42|At this moment, [Sudan] was not seen on the sofa in the living room, so he curiously walked towards the bathroom.
0:46:42|0:46:51|Just as they turned the corner, [Sudan] emerged from the restroom leaning on a cane, slowly moving towards the sofa, showcasing their great figure to the fullest as they walked.
0:47:7|0:47:23|He turned his head to look out the window, and the distant suspension tower was right in front of him. But in an instant, all the scenery in front of him suddenly started spinning, it turned out that everything just now was a beautiful dream that Xiao Chuan had while sleeping.
0:47:23|0:47:32|A gust of cool breeze drove away the summer heat, passing through the window onto his green face, Sudan opened his sleepy eyes and looked at the ceiling.
0:47:32|0:47:46|Sudan then turned his head towards the pillow, the brand new packaging of the goggles and respirator still intact. After a moment of contemplation, he took the packaging of the goggles, removed it in a few swift motions, and then put it on his head.
0:47:46|0:47:56|After his nose and eyes were completely covered, he adjusted his breathing while trying to adapt. At this moment, he suddenly seemed to remember something and revealed a faint smile.
0:47:57|0:48:8|By the abandoned house next to the railway crossing, Qingqing transformed her appearance from the past, wearing a skirt, leaning against the door of the minibus, swaying her feet, and smiling at the approaching person.
0:48:14|0:48:16|Qingqing took off her glasses.
0:48:27|0:48:37|The boy who was swimming by the river walked from the driver's seat to behind Qingqing at this moment, putting his arm around her shoulder and said to Xiaochuan.
0:48:37|0:48:46|[Sudan] patted the back of the small river behind him, took off his sunglasses and greeted the two people in front of him, then the four of them walked into the woods next to the railway track.
0:48:55|0:49:6|[Sudan] looked at the boy in front of him, the boy's hands pushing on [Sudan]'s wheelchair.
0:49:6|0:49:16|As soon as the words fell, the boy grabbed the armrest of the wheelchair tightly and pulled it towards himself with force.
0:49:19|0:49:24|The boy kept ramming the wheelchair against the car door.
0:49:24|0:49:32|[Sudan] did not get angry at the boy's behavior, but simply lifted his head and stared at him straight.
0:49:32|0:49:41|Facing [Sudan] without getting any useful information, the boy turned his head to look at Xiao Chuan.
0:49:41|0:49:43|[Sudan] placed his hands on the boy's cheeks.
0:49:46|0:49:51|Push hard, and the boy was pushed straight onto the tracks behind him.
0:49:51|0:49:54|After this scene, the four of them dispersed calmly.
0:49:56|0:50:1|Not far away, [Sudan] is moving straight ahead in a wheelchair.
0:50:1|0:50:7|The boy looked at his back, stuck his head out from the driver's seat, and shouted loudly at [Xiao Chuan].
0:50:7|0:50:10|Perhaps it was his words that made [Xiao Chuan] start to doubt.
0:50:10|0:50:15|At 3:30 in the morning, he unexpectedly arrived at the entrance of the KTV, sitting bored on the roadside bollard.
0:50:42|0:50:49|Soon, the taxi slowly accelerated away from the original location. After leaving the brightly lit urban area, it drove against the wind across the bridge over the river.
0:50:49|0:50:58|Sitting in the passenger seat, [Wu Tao] occasionally looked down at the watch on his wrist. Before long, they arrived at the dock.
0:50:58|0:51:3|The taxi slowly slid down from the top of the slope, then headed towards the guardrail at the dock.
0:51:13|0:51:26|[Su Dan] urged the driver while checking the watch, as the car was about to crash into the guardrail and plunge into the river. The driver glanced at [Su Dan] and slammed on the brakes to stop.
0:51:26|0:51:32|[Xiao Chuan] seemed to have no complaints about this, but instead turned on the backlight of the watch, which showed 4:06 in the early morning.
0:51:34|0:51:54|In the early morning on the construction site of the bridge, two people were seen fighting in the distance. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be [Sudan] and the boy who drove the minibus. Due to being a head shorter than the other and having a very slender figure, [Sudan] was quickly pinned down and beaten by the other. After returning home empty-handed from fishing, he locked himself in the bathroom.
0:51:54|0:52:8|Taking off his shirt, standing in front of the mirror, he looked at himself with blood at the corner of his mouth from being beaten. But the frequent knocking on the door quickly made him impatient. He turned around and forcefully pulled open the door of the bathroom, only to find [Sudan] standing there.
0:52:8|0:52:13|It turns out, the boy is called Dazhi, and [Fan Li] sits on the toilet in silence, feeling upset.
0:52:13|0:52:18|[Sudan] leaned coolly against the side, taking a towel and handing it to [Fan Li].
0:52:22|0:52:30|Fan Li wiped the injured corner of her mouth, Sudan straightened up and changed the towel to the other side, then leaned towards Fan Li again.
0:52:34|0:52:43|Next, [Sudan] rushed forward with his crutch to the other side of [Fan Li], and after the fight was settled, he pressed the towel against his cheeks and chest.
0:52:43|0:52:52|[Sudan]'s hair flicked towards [Fan Li]'s face with each wipe, the boy, wearing only underwear, quickly losing control of his breath.
0:52:54|0:53:0|But when [Sudan] leaned over to touch the injured chest of [Fan Li] again, she grabbed his wrist and forcefully pushed him away.
0:53:0|0:53:5|Unexpectedly, he ended up pinning his opponent directly beneath him.
0:53:5|0:53:11|Fan Li, wearing goggles and only a pair of underwear, then pushed Sudan out of the door.
0:53:11|0:53:19|He pushed [Sudan] through one damp, coarse cement ground after another, paying no attention to how extraordinary or vulgar they looked.
0:53:28|0:53:35|During the conversation, [Sudan] and [Fan Li] arrived at the dock.
0:53:35|0:53:42|With just three more steps forward, [Sudan] will fall into the river.
0:53:42|0:53:46|Xiao Chuan clenched the handles of the wheelchair and lowered his head, saying fiercely.
0:53:46|0:53:50|Seeing [Sudan] shaking his head, he pushed forward with all his strength.
0:53:50|0:53:52|At this moment, [Sudan] is still shaking his head.
0:53:57|0:54:16|Finally, with half of the people and wheelchairs already hanging over the river, [Sudan] was so scared that tears welled up in his eyes. However, he remained silent, as the raging river water fiercely pounded the shore, with waves overlapping one after another, creating a deafening sound. [Sudan]'s future was just a thought away behind the small stream.
0:54:17|0:54:22|At this moment, the clouds dispersed and the sun shone directly on the two people by the dock.
0:54:22|0:54:42|The cold and damp air seemed to be driven away by the sunlight, and the rising temperature quickly brought [Sudan] back to his senses from the shock. At the same time, it also restored Little River's sanity, causing him to take a step back and pull the wheelchair back to the ground. Finally, [Sudan] also let out a sigh of relief, took a deep breath, and hung his head heavily.
0:54:42|0:54:44|Closing their eyes to calm their emotions.
0:54:45|0:54:52|Xiao Chuan looked at her, the previous impulse long gone, so he could only turn around and push the wheelchair back the way they came.
0:54:52|0:54:59|Finally, it was time for a follow-up appointment. On a sunny morning, Xiao Chuan's mother brought [Sudan] to the hospital.
0:54:59|0:55:7|[Sudan] sat in the hospital room, boredly watching the machine being operated by [Fan Li] above his left leg, and couldn't help but speak up in the end.
0:55:9|0:55:12|However, the doctor's silence made her extremely nervous.
0:55:16|0:55:23|Mom Xiao Chuan stood at the door of the ward and looked on.
0:55:23|0:55:28|Different doctors reacted differently, and [Fan Li] suddenly covered her mouth and ran outside.
0:55:28|0:55:36|In the women's restroom, she was bending over, clutching the water pipe, constantly retching towards the sink pole, and then she paused and said.
0:55:36|0:55:42|[Sudan] sat at the door, then glanced at Xiaochuan's mother after listening.
0:55:46|0:55:54|Watching the shocked [Sudan], Xiao Chuan's mother turned her head to divert the water pipe, then she picked up cold water with both hands and kept splashing it on her face.
0:55:54|0:55:57|Pushing [Sudan] along, [Fan Li] left the hospital.
0:56:13|0:56:16|The two arrived at an old factory.
0:56:16|0:56:17|In the factory, the big boiler is burning steel.
0:56:40|0:56:42|Xiao Chuan's mother paused.
0:57:2|0:57:12|In the midst of conversation, [Sudan] and [Fan Li] had already left the roaring boiler and arrived on a platform. In the distance stood the dilapidated old factory buildings, with a high-temperature incinerator behind them.
0:57:12|0:57:17|Recalling her mediocre life, [Sudan] suddenly couldn't help but start sobbing.
0:57:18|0:57:37|Watching the wheelchair suddenly stop, [Sudan] first looked back at Xiao Chuan's mother, then looked ahead again. He slowly raised his right hand, gently patting Xiao Chuan's mother's back of the hand. Feeling the silent comfort from [Sudan], Xiao Chuan's mother's shoulders, which had been rising and falling, paused, her gasping gradually stopped, and she finally returned home.
0:57:55|0:58:10|[Sudan] unbuttons Xiao Chuan's mother's top, revealing her not-so-plump chest.
0:58:10|0:58:13|Soon after, [Sudan] and [Fan Li] arrived in front of the mirror.
0:58:13|0:58:16|[Sudan] applied her lipstick to moisturize Xiao Chuan's mother's lips.
0:58:23|0:58:27|Xiao Chuan's mother took off her flat shoes and put on a pair of eye-catching high heels.
0:58:30|0:58:33|As soon as the words fell, [Sudan] put on one of them.
0:58:57|0:59:2|[Sudan] excitedly looks at the mother of Xiao Chuan in front of him, sincerely praising her.
0:59:2|0:59:9|As the sun sets in the west, a group of middle-aged people are taking a group photo with their backs facing the river, next to a beautifully set dining table on the observation deck.
0:59:9|0:59:13|[Fan Li]'s mother, who had put on makeup, indeed looked more radiant than her peers of the same age.
0:59:22|0:59:27|Although it was a class reunion, Xiao Yi unexpectedly sat next to [Fan Li]'s mother and engaged in lively conversations with the people around.
0:59:29|0:59:47|On the other side, contrary to the lively gathering of classmates, Xiao Chuan is at home tidying up the bathroom. He first hangs the washcloth on the valve of the water pipe, then lights a cigarette, takes down the already dried towel from the clothes rack, and hangs the towel on the valve of the water pipe. After that, he lifts a chair and places it in the empty space in front of the water pipe.
0:59:48|0:59:59|Continuing, Xiao Chuan sat on the chair and leaned back, feeling the comfort. He then pushed [Sudan] from outside into the toilet, carefully helping him sit on the same chair.
0:59:59|1:0:11|At this moment, [Sudan] bent his injured left leg and placed it on the pedal, watching Xiaochuan wrap his own leg with plastic wrap layer by layer. In the damp and hot restroom, the two of them were already dressed in cool clothes.
1:0:12|1:0:18|In addition, [Sudan] was wearing a camisole and fishnet stockings, and Xiao Chuan was soon sweating profusely.
1:0:18|1:0:35|It was a coincidence that, while wrapping the plastic wrap around the calf of [Sudan], Xiaochuan's back of the hand accidentally brushed against the inner thigh of [Sudan], the smooth and sticky touch made Xiaochuan pause, but soon he continued wrapping the plastic wrap, covering it up very quickly.
1:0:35|1:0:41|But [Sudan] bent over the spot that had just been grazed the next second, making Xiao Chuan break out in a cold sweat.
1:0:42|1:0:53|Thinking that she had already endured the tough times, but hearing the gushing sound of water in the bathroom, Xiao Chuan couldn't help but sit in [Sudan]'s wheelchair, wandering around the house like a headless fly.
1:0:53|1:0:59|It seems like he is trying to use the sound of friction with the ground to cover up that magical sound.
1:0:59|1:1:7|But no matter how he walked, the location of the toilet seemed to be like a magnet, attracting him to eventually walk in that direction.
1:1:17|1:1:21|A tumor on his calf that is ten centimeters long makes [Sudan] unable to help but complain.
1:1:25|1:1:31|The small stream that was originally standing in the distance couldn't help but approach, trying to get a clear view of the scar that was difficult to disappear.
1:1:31|1:1:42|However, before getting close to the bed, [Sudan] angrily grabbed a pillow and threw it at Xiao Chuan, then sat up from the bed, took the crutch, and limped out of the ward.
1:1:49|1:1:55|Watching the stubborn figure of [Sudan] left in the ward, Xiao Chuan still couldn't bring himself to say anything harsh.
1:1:55|1:2:3|However, once back home, [Sudan] completely let down his guard, lying back on the sofa, lifting his legs up towards the sky, and studying for a while.
1:2:4|1:2:9|He, who was still smiling, suddenly turned his mouth down and burst into a cry of pain. 
1:2:9|1:2:16|Xiao Chuan approached with a cup of water, wondering whether to turn around and leave, allowing [Sudan] to vent alone.
1:2:16|1:2:22|Before she could even put down the water glass, he wrapped his arms around her waist and held her tightly in front of him.
1:2:23|1:2:28|This sudden move left [Fan Li] at a loss, but there was no sign of refusal.
1:2:28|1:2:34|So, [Sudan] simply buried his head in [Fan Li]'s abdomen and cried heartily.
1:2:34|1:2:38|[Fan Li] also gradually placed her hand on [Sudan]'s shoulder, unconsciously rubbing it.
1:2:39|1:2:44|After he finally calmed down, [Fan Li] turned around and went back to his room.
1:2:44|1:2:51|Pulled out a toolbox from under the bed, then walked back to the living room.
1:2:51|1:2:57|[Sudan], lying on the sofa on his side, kept pulling back his scarred left leg, but couldn't resist the strength of [Fan Li].
1:2:57|1:3:1|Soon, he obediently placed his left leg on the opponent's thigh.
1:3:1|1:3:5|Fan Li then opened the box and took out a paintbrush from inside.
1:3:6|1:3:11|After dabbing on the paint, [Sudan] started creating around the scars.
1:3:11|1:3:19|Seeing [Fan Li] looking at him earnestly in profile, [Sudan] no longer resisted as he did at the beginning. Instead, he propped his arm under his head and stared firmly at [Fan Li].
1:3:19|1:3:32|Just like that, Xiao Chuan held [Sudan]'s slender ankle firmly, drawing for a long time until the desired shape was completely outlined, then took out another pen and filled in the colors bit by bit.
1:3:40|1:3:46|Xiao Chuan turned his head to look at [Sudan] on the other side of the sofa, then continued to lower his head and draw.
1:3:46|1:3:49|[Sudan] suddenly sat up.
1:4:2|1:4:11|[Sudan] raised his hand and patted Xiao Chuan on the head, then lay back down, watching him continue to draw on his own legs.
1:4:11|1:4:19|In the corner of the living room, Mom Xiao Chuan, who had returned at some point, listened to the conversation between the two and leaned against the wall, raising her head and staring out the window.
1:4:19|1:4:26|It's late at night, and the only thing in this house that still seems to hold a smile is the picture of Dad Xiao Chuan hanging on the wall.
1:4:26|1:4:35|In the quiet house, light seeped out from the crack of Xiao Chuan's bedroom door. Upon closer inspection, he found that he had once again brought out a Nepalese.
1:4:35|1:4:46|At this moment, he was using a carving knife to slowly refine the appearance of [Sudan], the tree-like hair behind the head, full chest, and slender legs, making it clear who the carved person was.
1:4:47|1:4:55|Outside on the sofa, [Sudan] was sleeping soundly under a thin blanket, and the deliberately exposed left leg finally revealed the pattern painted by Xiao Chuan.
1:4:55|1:5:3|After all the paint dried, two palm-sized flowers bloomed brightly, completely covering up that ugly scar.
1:5:3|1:5:11|By the communal water pool outside the house, [Sudan] was delicately washing the dishes after dinner, everything seemed so eerie yet inexplicably harmonious.
1:5:13|1:5:22|Perhaps after hearing what [Sudan] said, the next morning, [Xiao Chuan] arranged to meet [Qing Qing] downstairs in their own building.
1:5:22|1:5:34|In the morning market, bustling with people, [Sudan] sprinted down the long street and hurried towards [Fan Li] at the intersection.
1:5:41|1:5:48|[Su Dan] stood facing [Fan Li], hands hanging at the sides of his pants, tilting his head with a blank expression.
1:5:48|1:6:2|Upon hearing the insults from [Xiao Chuan], [Qing Qing] unexpectedly lifted the corners of her mouth again. At this moment, [Xiao Chuan] was like a bow, gesturing towards the direction of the long street diagonally in front of him. It turned out that [Sudan] was standing there leaning on a cane.
1:6:2|1:6:7|[Su Dan] was about to leave with a smile, but when he heard [Fan Li] calling his name, he turned back to where he was.
1:6:12|1:6:24|Watching [Sudan] pretend to be cool, [Fan Li] gently lowered her head and pursed her lips, then walked forward, and embraced [Sudan]'s shoulders with both arms.
1:6:33|1:6:47|In the moment of being hugged, [Wu Tao]'s expression had already softened, and now his eyes were even more evasive.
1:6:47|1:6:52|[Qingqing] has long since discarded her bulky glasses and even put on earrings.
1:6:52|1:6:58|Glancing at [Wu Tao] who was in a daze, she smiled and turned away.
1:7:1|1:7:18|In the narrow and crowded hallway, [Mrs. Xiao Chuan] greeted the neighbor playing cards, then carried a large bag of vegetables towards home.
1:7:18|1:7:29|[Ms. Xiao Chuan] held a basin and kept sprinkling water on the ground, telling the two to behave themselves. She walked up and turned down the volume of the TV.
1:7:29|1:7:30|[Mrs. Xiao Chuan] picks up a mop.
1:7:34|1:7:36|Drag the water on the ground away bit by bit.
1:7:44|1:7:51|Hearing [Xiao Chuan's mother]'s response, [Sudan] didn't mind at all, but instead chuckled at the TV screen.
1:7:51|1:7:57|[Su Dan] sat beside her, holding a peeled orange in her hand, watching TV and stuffing it into her mouth.
1:7:57|1:8:7|Watching the two of them not lifting a finger to help clean up the house, [Mrs. Xiao Chuan] was filled with anger. She kicked away [Sudan]'s shoes placed next to the sofa and vigorously pulled the mop back and forth.
1:8:9|1:8:16|At this moment, [Sudan] turned his head and lifted his legs in the air, making room for [Fan Li's mother] to mop the floor.
1:8:16|1:8:20|After thinking for a moment, [Sudan] stood up and walked towards the depths of the living room.
1:8:21|1:8:32|[Xiao Chuan] walked to the window, turned the air conditioner to the maximum, then sat back next to [Sudan], ate a piece of orange, and turned up the volume of the TV.
1:8:42|1:8:59|Mom Xiao Chuan stopped mopping the floor instantly upon hearing this, then fiercely threw the mop to the ground, picked up a wooden stick and turned around.
1:8:59|1:9:1|The mother and son chased each other out of the house.
1:9:9|1:9:13|Before long, the two of them ran into the vegetable market.
1:9:13|1:9:21|The neighbors seemed unfazed as if they were used to it.
1:9:29|1:9:35|Before long, [Sudan] stopped in her tracks and watched as [Fan Li] gradually disappeared at the end of the road.
1:9:40|1:9:43|[Sudan] is lying on the stone chair by the river, applying medicine to Xiao Chuan.
1:9:48|1:9:53|[Sudan] stopped in his tracks upon hearing this, and Xiao Chuan also sat up, turning to look at him.
1:9:53|1:9:58|Early in the morning, [Fan Li] yawningly arrived at the bus stop on the street.
1:9:58|1:10:8|The scorching sun overhead, he, who was waiting for the bus but couldn't find any shelter, could only place his palm on his forehead to shield his eyes from the sun. Luckily, the bus arrived shortly after.
1:10:13|1:10:32|In the clinic, Sudan held the microphone, answering the other party very respectfully. After gently hanging up the phone, she took a deep breath, closed her eyes, then turned to look out the window. But when she touched the mirror behind her, she firmly fixed her gaze on herself, because of the hot environment.
1:10:33|1:10:37|Sudan and Fan Li were already sticking wetly to their faces, looking very tired.
1:10:37|1:10:43|The next day, [Fan Li] changed into a beautiful dress and sat in the front passenger seat of Xiaoyi's car.
1:10:43|1:10:53|Seeing Sudan remaining silent, Fan Li boldly leaned over and lightly kissed the other person's cheek.
1:10:53|1:10:56|Then he sat back in his seat, staring straight out the window.
1:11:0|1:11:10|Upon hearing Xiaoyi's question, [Fan Li] averted her gaze, lowered her head, and softly responded. Not far from them was a magnificent and luxurious hotel.
1:11:10|1:11:15|The majestic building towered into the sky, overlooking the entire city from the city center.
1:11:15|1:11:22|At night, [Fan Li] arrives at the theater.
1:11:22|1:11:24|In the theater, the captain gathers everyone together.
1:11:33|1:11:38|But only [Fan Li] leaned against the door of the rehearsal hall, drinking from a bottle of wine in big gulps.
1:11:41|1:11:46|With her emotions in order, the choir's first rehearsal officially began.
1:11:46|1:12:3|The team members lined up neatly in two rows, with the height decreasing from the middle to the sides. The men in short sleeves and trousers stood at the back, while the women in knee-length skirts stood in the front row. [Wu Tao] stood in the middle of the team with hands folded in front of him, eyes closed and sleeping.
1:12:28|1:12:37|After hesitating for a while, [Sudan] gently put down his crutch, knelt on the carpet with one leg first, and then slowly lay down beside Xiao Chuan.
1:12:37|1:12:41|At this moment, a moldy surface with undulating contours under the bed appeared before [Sudan].
1:12:41|1:12:47|Xiao Chuan turned his head to look at him after hearing his question, and then twisted open the light bulb at the head of the bed.
1:12:49|1:12:58|The originally blurry ceiling was instantly illuminated by a warm light, revealing the microcosm of the city in front of the two characters.
1:12:58|1:13:12|Next, Xiaochuan twisted another switch, and the edge of the microscopic scene instantly lit up with a string of fingernail-sized light bulbs. Following [Sudan]'s gaze, the microscopic scene completely replicated the city's real appearance one to one.
1:13:13|1:13:20|Not only because of the still under construction bridge, but also the old factories standing near the Xiao Chuan's house.
1:13:40|1:13:50|Xiao Chuan smiled and pointed to the masterpiece under his bed, even blowing a puff of smoke from the factory chimney he had created to simulate its abandonment.
1:13:50|1:13:56|And Sudan's mother, unaware of this, continued to sing passionately and wholeheartedly in the rehearsal hall.
1:13:56|1:13:57|The Sudan naturally wouldn't know.
1:13:57|1:14:3|Sudan and Fan Li were lying side by side on the bed, laughing happily.
1:14:19|1:14:25|At some point, the two who were originally lying shoulder to shoulder found their shoulders touching each other.
1:14:25|1:14:38|The dangling feet in the air collided with each other, and [Wu Tao] even daringly used his heel to touch [Sudan]'s toes, while turning his head to secretly stare at his smiling face, forgetting to look away for a long time.
1:14:38|1:14:44|And after going through rehearsal after rehearsal, [Sudan]'s mother shed a torrent of tears.
1:14:44|1:14:56|The night was deep, and now only [Sudan] was left lying under the bed. After slowly turning off the light of the microscope, she carefully put down the curtain and then lay back on the bed.
1:14:56|1:15:5|On the sofa in the living room outside, [Sudan] rested her head on one arm, appearing to be asleep, but her wide-open eyes betrayed the fact that she was full of worries.
1:15:7|1:15:17|For a long time, after finishing the rehearsal, [Fan Li] returned home and saw [Sudan]'s legs with flowers drawn on them, realizing that her white legs were directly facing the door of [Fan Li]'s room.
1:15:17|1:15:26|Sudan turned away disdainfully, bent down to cover the gorgeous flower with a thin blanket, then quietly made his way to the other end of the sofa and sat down on a separate chair.
1:15:27|1:15:34|With both hands gently placed in front of him, bending at the waist and squinting, he stared at [Sudan] who was sound asleep on the sofa.
1:15:34|1:15:47|Perhaps it was the intense gaze that woke [Sudan] up from his dream, and he quickly sat up when he saw [Ma Dongmei], the mother of [Xiao Chuan], in front of him.
1:15:47|1:15:53|Upon hearing this sudden news, [Sudan] straightened his body and then looked towards the small boat mother.
1:15:56|1:16:0|Xiao Chuan's mother was resolute and uncompromising, leaving no room for negotiation.
1:16:9|1:16:13|Xiao Chuan's mother stood up straight and fiercely confronted [Sudan].
1:16:13|1:16:19|Sudan stood there as if the one being scolded was not herself, holding her head high and staring motionlessly at Xiaochuan's mother.
1:16:19|1:16:25|In the end, [Sudan] was the first to avoid eye contact at the meeting, lowering her head slowly with her shoulders drooping.
1:16:25|1:16:32|The next morning, [Sudan] arrived at the grand lobby of a luxurious hotel.
1:16:32|1:16:35|Xiao Yi was about to walk towards Xiao Chuan's mother when he was stopped by four burly men.
1:16:44|1:16:57|Xiaoyi pinched the plastic bag in his hand, then lowered his head and walked straight towards Xiaochuan's mother, passing the four people in front of him.
1:17:9|1:17:13|Mrs. Xiao Chuan tightened her grip on the plastic bag in her hand, then looked behind Xiao Yi.
1:17:15|1:17:23|Xiao Yi smiled and waved behind him, then looked at the mother Xiao Chuan in front of him, clearly opening his mouth.
1:17:23|1:17:36|Next, Sudan looked up and down at Fan Li, then smiled and turned away. Before she had gone far, she was grabbed by the tallest and strongest man among the four, who twisted her neck and dragged her into the depths of the hotel as if cutting her face.
1:17:37|1:17:50|[Ms. Xiaochuan's mother] raised her foot and looked in the direction where the five people left. Then she tightened the plastic bag in her hand, thought for a moment, stuffed it into her shoulder bag, and hurriedly left the hotel.
1:17:50|1:17:55|After leaving the hotel, [Xiao Chuan's mother] did not immediately go home, but went to the health center in the city.
1:17:55|1:18:14|On the wooden table, a large number of one and five yuan bills are neatly stacked into a tower. At this moment, [Fan Li] unfolds the crumpled bills one by one and flattens them out, then picks up the hot water tank and presses it heavily back and forth on top of them.
1:18:14|1:18:18|Continuing to repeat the action of rolling the ten yuan banknote out of the plastic bag.
1:18:19|1:18:29|Then, they pressed and sorted the bundles one by one, securely tied them with rubber bands, and finally rearranged all the bills and put them back into the bag.
1:18:29|1:18:33|A few days later, [Mrs. Xiao Chuan] and [Sudan] arrived at the hospital.
1:18:33|1:18:37|Sudan and Fan Li sat quietly on stone chairs in the corridor, one meter apart.
1:18:37|1:18:48|[Ms. Xiaochuan] thought for a moment, unzipped the bag, took out a plastic bag from it, casually flipped through it, and revealed bundles of banknotes inside to hand over to [Sudan].
1:18:50|1:18:55|[Sudan] didn't even look at it. Seeing this, [Mrs. Xiao Chuan] had no choice but to put the money on the chair.
1:19:1|1:19:8|[Sudan] held a crutch in one hand, his eyes staring blankly ahead, unaware even when his short sleeves slipped off his shoulders.
1:19:18|1:19:26|Mrs. Xiaochuan crossed her legs, folded her arms, and took a deep breath after a nurse walked past them. Then she turned her head and said.
1:20:13|1:20:19|As soon as the music stopped, Xiaochuan's mother picked up the 20,000 yuan and handed it to [Sudan] not far away.
1:20:25|1:20:36|After saving the large sum of money that was considered a fortune to her, [Sudan] looked at Xiao Chuan's mother with moist eyes, then leaned on her cane with one hand and made her way to the staircase with a fist and a crutch.
1:20:36|1:20:53|A few months later, in the same beautifully decorated KTV, a group of eight girls in off-the-shoulder mini skirts lined up in a triangular formation and walked slowly towards the front desk. Even in the dim lighting, you could still see the slender figures of the girls.
1:20:53|1:21:1|Passing by the front desk, Sudan, Fan Li, and Wu Tao all tacitly took signs from the bartender and then dispersed, heading towards different private rooms.
1:21:2|1:21:8|After passing through one private room after another, there was only one woman left at the front of the team, the supervisor.
1:21:8|1:21:12|She pushed open a private room door, and sure enough, the person inside was [Sudan].
1:21:12|1:21:21|After seeing the face of the guest in front of him clearly, the smile that was originally raised froze on his face instantly.
1:21:21|1:21:27|Sudan quickly raised the corners of his mouth and calmly asked, the guest turned out to be none other than Xiao Chuan.
1:21:32|1:21:38|[Sudan] walked over to the sofa with his cane, but [Xiao Chuan] remained motionless after hearing it.
1:21:38|1:21:45|[Su Dan] stood in a loose-fitting suit, with sleeves rolled up high and one foot resting on the coffee table covered with plates of drinks.
1:21:48|1:22:1|[Chuan] once again danced in front of [Sudan] to the tune, excitedly taking off his suit and throwing it over [Sudan]'s head, then picking up a glass of wine and crazily pouring it into his own mouth.
1:22:1|1:22:11|Before long, the two of them raised their glasses and drank heartily. [Sudan] even grabbed the microphone and started playing a single song on repeat, dancing wildly on the sofa and coffee table with [Xiao Chuan].
1:22:13|1:22:23|The hustle and bustle dissipated, [Sudan] hailed a taxi and helped the already drunk [Xiao Chuan] into the back seat. Not feeling assured, he then crouched down and sat beside him.
1:22:23|1:22:32|Soon, the taxi drove away from the bustling city and headed towards the riverbank. Watching the turbulent river under the moonlight, [Sudan] suddenly felt very bored.
1:22:34|1:22:43|Therefore, he rolled down the window and leaned against the car door, watching the taxi heading towards the dilapidated road, when suddenly he felt a weight on his shoulder.
1:22:43|1:22:47|[Sudan], who was originally leaning against the back of the chair, rested his head on [Fan Li]'s shoulder.
1:22:47|1:22:52|The two of them then headed towards the hotel by the river.
1:22:52|1:22:57|[Chuan] lay on the bed, propping up his eyelids, watching [Sudan] muttering beside him.
1:22:57|1:23:1|[Sudan] lies back in silence.
1:23:1|1:23:2|Xiao Chuan spoke again, unwilling to give up.
1:23:5|1:23:14|Before speaking, Xiao Chuan boldly wrapped his left arm around [Sudan]'s waist and stared at his face, which was close at hand, saying seriously.
1:23:30|1:23:43|The uncomfortable feeling of being drunk suddenly surged up. Sudan swallowed his saliva and lowered his head to say softly.
1:23:43|1:23:56|In the midst of the conversation, Sudan could no longer resist the effects of alcohol and closed his eyes.
1:24:13|1:24:20|As soon as the words fell, Xiaochuan completely laid his head at the end of the bed, but [Sudan] suddenly opened his eyes.
1:24:20|1:24:26|However, Xiao Chuan had fallen asleep completely this time, naturally not hearing [Sudan]'s response.
1:24:26|1:24:40|[Sudan], who was originally lying at the foot of the bed, felt the burning breath of [Fan Li] trapped between his arm and ear. He carefully pushed her aside and then turned his head, sleeping alone on the pillow at the head of the bed.
1:24:41|1:24:50|In his sleep, Xiaochuan kept changing positions, as if he would sleep when tired and eat when hungry, instinctively searching for [Sudan]'s location.
1:24:50|1:25:0|In his dream, Sudan returned to the riverside where the accident happened. This time, he finally put on goggles, a simple breathing apparatus, and the entire diving gear.
1:25:0|1:25:21|Early in the morning, braving the heavy dew, [Wu Tao] tightly clad in swim trunks, walked towards the railing by the river on foot. Perhaps due to the early hour, there was no one around privately, and the distant river surface was also devoid of its usual hustle and bustle, with only two or three boats passing by. Slowly, [Wu Tao] stood by the railing with a full set of diving equipment.
1:25:21|1:25:26|Looking into the distance through the goggles, then lowering his head to glance at the rolling river water at his feet.
1:25:27|1:25:39|Recalling the moment when she heard her mother warning her not to go into the water at the dinner table, as well as [Sudan] mentioning someone accidentally falling into the water, she took a deep breath and slowly began to retreat backwards.
1:25:39|1:25:47|The next moment, finally gathering courage, after running nearly ten meters, [Fan Li] leaped straight down through the gap in the railing.
1:25:47|1:25:51|The splashes may be big, but they are insignificant in the face of the surging waves.
1:25:51|1:25:53|Two years have passed in the blink of an eye.
1:26:11|1:26:19|Watching her daughter about to wake up while lying on the pointed head, [Sudan] gently patted her daughter's back with her hand, walking back and forth in the living room.
1:26:19|1:26:28|[Su Dan] took the passbook and then turned back to his room. He then pulled back the curtain at the end of the bed, turned on the switch, revealing the room of the miniature city.
1:26:31|1:26:40|However, the current appearance of this city's miniature is no longer as dazzling as it was two years ago, with dust covering the mold, causing [Wu Tao] to sneeze uncontrollably.
1:26:42|1:26:50|Holding the Tutsi man belonging to [Sudan] in his hand, [Fan Li], who got the address from his mother, soon set out on the search for the missing person.
1:26:50|1:26:56|On a day filled with the chirping of birds and the fragrance of flowers, far away from the hustle and bustle of the city, [Wu Tao] arrived at a small village in front of a big mountain.
1:26:56|1:27:1|He took off the torn shirt and put on a button-up shirt, now he looks quite mature.
1:27:1|1:27:7|In the next moment, in front of an old blue-tiled house, he was forced to drop his pretentious mature disguise.
1:27:7|1:27:11|At the end of the alley in the old house, a noodle and bun shop stole his sight.
1:27:20|1:27:29|[Sudan] changed her image of wearing suspenders, fishnet stockings, and super short skirts, and put on the most ordinary short-sleeved shorts, smiling and saying goodbye to the customers who came to eat breakfast.
1:27:29|1:27:36|After putting the change into the wooden box on the roadside, [Sudan] picked up a few eggs as usual and put them into the pot beside him.
1:27:36|1:27:43|Just as he was about to find a moment to rest in the store, he looked up and saw [Wu Tao] sitting at the nearest table, seemingly out of nowhere.
1:27:44|1:27:49|When they met, [Sudan] took the wallet with one hand and pulled a chair to sit next to [Xiao Chuan].
1:27:55|1:28:0|[Sudan] smiled at [Xiao Chuan] while opening his wallet to find change for the customer.
1:28:0|1:28:7|The surroundings may be simple, but [Sudan] still smiles sincerely. However, soon his smile fades from his face.
1:28:7|1:28:18|At this moment, [Sudan] seemed to realize something was wrong. After giving the change to the customer, he followed Xiao Chuan's gaze to his wallet, then looked up to meet Xiao Chuan's questioning and angry eyes.
1:28:20|1:28:26|[Sudan] also quickly restrained his smile, pinched the money in his hand, and carefully tucked it into his wallet.
1:28:26|1:28:34|In the top transparent compartment of the wallet, there was a photo of her cheek-to-cheek with her father.
1:28:34|1:28:39|[Sudan] at this moment, his thoughts also returned to the moment when he first met Xiaochuan's father.
1:28:39|1:28:46|Drunk, [Fan Li] left the KTV and sat in the front passenger seat of Xiaochuan's dad's taxi, leaning against the car door and vomiting wildly from outside the car.
1:28:57|1:29:2|[Sudan] wipes the corners of his mouth, holding a tissue in his hand, and says angrily.
1:29:2|1:29:9|After driving away from the bustling city area, Dad suddenly stopped on a secluded path.
1:29:9|1:29:13|Dad Ogawa turned his head to look at [Sudan].
1:29:13|1:29:16|Dad Xiao Chuan pinched the steering wheel and said solemnly with pursed lips.
1:29:20|1:29:38|The engine roared in the night, with [Sudan] leaning against the car door, looking at the stern-faced Xiaochuan's father. He lowered his hand from his forehead, originally intending to leave with a sneer on his face, but when he turned his head and saw how serious Xiaochuan's father was, he had to sit up straight, lifting his head to look directly at Xiaochuan's father.
1:29:53|1:30:5|The two arrived at a rooftop, reminiscing about the past, then [Sudan] spoke again. At that moment, a breeze blew by, once again taking [Sudan] back to that summer.
1:30:5|1:30:10|On a narrow road that has not been cleared yet, a taxi is slowly driving.
1:30:10|1:30:16|Suddenly, a person wearing a helmet and protective gear on all four limbs fell out from the passenger seat.
1:30:16|1:30:22|The taxi then carried the person back along the same route, accelerating and repeating the previous actions.
1:30:23|1:30:30|After the copilot was thrown out and landed on the ground, a driver dressed the same as him also jumped out from the driver's seat.
1:30:31|1:30:37|After practicing over and over again, [Sudan] and [Fan Li] parked the car in the middle of the road, then leaned against the back to relax.
1:30:37|1:30:41|Approaching slowly, it turns out to be Xiaochuan's dad and [Sudan].
1:30:41|1:30:50|The sun rises in the east and sets in the west. They seem to have forgotten about time, repeatedly increasing the throttle, jumping down from their positions without hesitation.
1:30:50|1:30:57|Sudan and Fan Li, with their efforts paying off, supported each other as they drove away once they achieved satisfactory results in their training.
1:31:2|1:31:6|After listening to this account, Sudan still harbored great doubts about the day his father had the accident.
1:31:12|1:31:19|Hearing Xiao Chuan's question, [Sudan] picked up a cup of tea, took a sip, and then began to recall again.
1:31:19|1:31:30|In the early morning, the clean and bright marble floor highlighted the slender figure of [Sudan], and her refreshing leather skirt with suspenders accentuated her good figure.
1:31:30|1:31:36|At the KTV exit, Sudan saw his father Xiao Chuan sitting in the driver's seat outside, carrying a bag of snacks and drinks as he walked straight towards him.
1:31:39|1:31:46|[Sudan] sat on the hood, took out a mirror to touch up her makeup.
1:31:46|1:31:53|Dad Xiao Chuan leaned on the other side of the hood with both hands, opened the bag of temporary drinks and smiled in response.
1:32:18|1:32:28|After finishing the last sip of wine, Xiaochuan's father stood up straight, leaning against the hood just like [Sudan], and ate a shrimp stick while looking into the distance, his eyes full of new hope.
1:32:30|1:32:39|Then, the two of them turned back to the car, with [Sudan] leaning on the car door with one elbow, unconsciously raising his hand in front of him, continuously biting his nails.
1:32:39|1:32:43|Then he raised his hand and touched his forehead, casually playing with his hair. 
1:32:43|1:32:51|Amid the sound of the brake line being cut by Xiaochuan's father, [Sudan] finally made up his mind and firmly grasped the handle above the car door.
1:32:51|1:32:54|At this moment, Sudan's father opened the car door and sat back inside.
1:33:21|1:33:32|[Sudan], who was well-prepared, first put on a pair of earrings the size of palms, and then took out a CD from the storage box in the front passenger seat and inserted it into the car's CD player.
1:33:32|1:33:39|In an instant, the familiar and story-filled song lingered in their ears, then they smiled at each other.
1:33:39|1:34:0|Dad Xiao Chuan started the taxi after watching [Sudan] take a deep breath, perhaps accidentally triggering the car's CD player when destroying the brake line. The previously warm and romantic song was suddenly filled with static, as if hinting at the mysterious reason behind Dad Xiao Chuan's disappearance.
1:34:0|1:34:6|After experiencing one car jump experiment after another, [Sudan] and [Fan Li] have finally embarked on the journey.
1:34:7|1:34:15|After driving into the dock from the depths of the lane, Dad Xiao Chuan stepped on the gas and headed straight towards the river.
1:34:15|1:34:20|The turbulent river water quickly engulfed the taxi, but the two of them were nowhere to be seen. 
1:34:20|1:34:22|Time goes back to the present.
1:34:28|1:34:34|[Sudan] followed Xiaochuan with a limp and a punch.
1:35:2|1:35:14|The original small stream walking in front of [Sudan] heard his confession about the car chase incident that year, but stopped with a smile, turned around to look at him, calmly expressing her own opinion. In response, [Sudan] just smiled.
1:35:18|1:35:21|Xiao Chuan heard this, his lips twitched, but he remained silent.
1:35:21|1:35:27|Next, [Sudan] was seen dragging the lame leg past himself.
1:35:27|1:35:33|Kawaguchi restrained himself from the impulse to catch up with [Sudan], watching him slowly walk away from the alley out of the corner of his eye.
1:35:33|1:35:41|Unwilling to accept it, as [Sudan] was about to disappear around the corner, Xiao Chuan suddenly turned around and stared straight at his back.
1:35:42|1:35:52|No one would have expected that the woman who used to love wearing tight leather skirts and high boots would now be selling breakfast in this quiet village, wearing a short-sleeved shirt and skirt that had long lost its original color.
1:35:55|1:36:1|Ignoring the clumsy person's gaze behind him, [Sudan] once again recalled the day of the incident.
1:36:1|1:36:5|Accompanied by singing, the taxi plunged into the river without hesitation.
1:36:5|1:36:12|The moment the vehicle left the road, it flipped heavily and fell down, with the roof slapping directly on the surface of the river.
1:36:12|1:36:21|The surging river water quickly poured into the front seat of the taxi through the wide-open window, causing the car's CD player to instantly go silent, abruptly stopping the music.
1:36:22|1:36:28|Before long, the entire car was completely vertical with the surface of the river, gradually being submerged in the darkness of the night.
1:36:28|1:36:34|In the dark night, the taillights of the taxi struggled on the river surface, resembling the signal of a dying person calling for help.
1:36:34|1:36:49|Unfortunately, in just a few flashes, the vehicles disappeared from the river surface, as if no one had seen anyone crawling out of the front seat of the taxi. All that could be heard was the taxi gradually sinking with a gurgling sound.
1:36:49|1:36:59|In less than a moment, the commotion from the flooding subsided completely, and the river surface returned to calmness, as if all of this was the most normal state of affairs now.
1:36:59|1:37:5|By the dock is a small boat resting, with the city in the distance still not fully awake.
1:37:5|1:37:15|Sparse lights scattered on the river surface, boats returning home either early in the morning or late at night, appearing ordinary and familiar to an average person.
1:37:15|1:37:17|It's just as ordinary as it can be.
1:37:18|1:37:20|For the two inside the taxi.
1:37:20|1:37:29|It will have a great impact on their future days.
1:37:29|1:37:38|Still in that old house, [Sudan] is sitting at the dining table, bending over to play with toys with his sister.
1:37:38|1:37:41|[Sudan]'s mother brought dishes of food one by one from the kitchen to the table.
1:37:46|1:37:57|Next, [Sudan]'s mother turned around and took out a bottle of wine from the cabinet.
1:37:57|1:38:4|Xiao Chuan, upon hearing this, stopped teasing his younger sister, turned around, picked up his chopsticks and started eating. After just one bite, he stopped.
1:38:4|1:38:8|Mom Xiao Chuan poured a glass of wine and asked Xiao Chuan.
1:38:10|1:38:16|Xiao Chuan glanced down at his leg and saw his little sister playing with toys in the car, not looking back as he answered.
1:38:16|1:38:21|Mrs. Xiaochuan had to pick up a piece of food from the plate and put it in the bowl, then said.
1:38:27|1:38:33|Sudan didn't respond, but after taking two bites of rice, he couldn't help but speak up.
1:38:38|1:38:51|Wu Tao, Xiaoguan's mother stopped picking vegetables, unconsciously chewed twice, picked up the wine glass next to her and swallowed it in one gulp, then picked up the chopsticks again to eat while looking at her young daughter.
1:38:51|1:38:55|[Sudan], [Fan Li], and [Wu Tao] started an ordinary day like this.
