0:2:1|0:2:14|[Shen Mo] is speaking on stage, but the male leader is taking selfies below. When the employees hear that there is money to be made, they all enthusiastically applaud.
0:3:39|0:3:44|[Shen Mo] respectfully finished his drink, casually took the phone on the table, and left the banquet. Later, he placed the phone in the dishes of the waiter.
0:4:3|0:4:18|The police officer who was speaking suddenly saw a cell phone in the food brought in, with a photo of the thief king on it. On the other side, [Shen Mo] pushed open a door abruptly and solemnly patted the suitcase beside him.
0:4:28|0:4:40|While [Shen Mo] was getting angry, a group of police officers rushed into the thief king's banquet hall. The police officers then leaped onto the table and ran a few steps, directly pinning down the thief king who was drinking.
0:4:48|0:4:55|[Shen Mo] finished speaking and walked with the suitcase to the hotel lobby. Inside the lobby, chaos ensued as the police were arresting the criminal gang.
0:5:22|0:5:38|[Shen Mo], who helped the police successfully take down the criminal gang, arrived at the bar at nightfall. He held a glass of wine, embraced beautiful women, drank the liquor in his hand heartily, and played games with them. The next moment, he sat alone in the private room, pondering about life with a sense of loneliness.
0:5:57|0:6:16|[Shen Mo] was immersed in the extravagant atmosphere, when suddenly blood started flowing from his nose. He seemed to sense something, casually wiped it away, only to faint the next moment. As the day broke, [Shen Mo] slowly regained consciousness lying in a hospital bed.
0:6:48|0:6:53|[Shen Mo] watches the doctor's lip movements through the glass and realizes that his time is running out.
0:7:1|0:7:22|[Shen Mo] then sat in a wheelchair and was pushed out of the ward by a nurse. The police officer who had caught the thief king happened to be walking in the hospital corridor. He should have run into [Shen Mo], but instead saw the nurse pushing an empty wheelchair past him.
0:7:24|0:7:51|In the bustling street, two children holding donation boxes ask passersby for help. Suddenly, a man wearing a gold ring approaches them, stuffing a large amount of cash from his pocket into the donation box before leaving casually, leaving the children puzzled. Inside a room filled with wine bottles, [Shen Mo] sits down and takes a sip of water from a glass.
0:7:52|0:7:55|Transferring 1 million to Hope via computer操作着.
0:8:2|0:8:16|In the bank hall, [Shen Mo] holds a remittance form for the Boai Committee for the Disabled in Ping'an County. He picks up a pen but finds it out of ink. He blows on the pen tip, but it doesn't work. A stranger next to him finishes filling out the form and leaves her pen on the self-service counter.
0:8:16|0:8:24|[Shen Mo] quickly stepped forward to pick up the pen and fill it out, but as he lowered his head, blood dripped from his nose.
0:9:5|0:9:17|[Shen Mo] staggered to the table with the dishes and the guests couldn't wait to start enjoying the food. After that, [Shen Mo] turned back to the kitchen to wash the vegetables.
0:9:28|0:9:43|The landlady brandished a kitchen knife and threatened, as soon as she finished speaking, the customers in the shop suddenly fell to the ground convulsing. The landlord looked at [Shen Mo] walking away and said to his wife in panic:
0:10:34|0:10:49|The customer who was just convulsing all over is now deftly transferring the money of the restaurant owner. It turns out he is the accomplice of [Shen Mo]: [Du Yu]. On the other end of the phone, the restaurant owner is angrily tapping the screen as he watches the balance drop to only ten dollars at the ATM.
0:11:36|0:11:42|[Du Yu] pointed to the Hermes bag on the computer and introduced it to [Shen Mo], but [Shen Mo] remained indifferent.
0:11:51|0:12:4|He walked to the corner and opened the door, [Shen Mo] holding a takeout, said: The spilled takeout dirtied the young man's shoes.
0:13:7|0:13:25|[Shen Mo] successfully joined Mr. Jia's company. As he walked out of the company, nodding and bowing, he suddenly turned cold the moment the company door closed. He turned around, unbuttoned his shirt, and walked into the dim corridor, where the walls were covered with small advertisements.
0:13:25|0:13:51|[Shen Mo] took off the deliveryman's uniform, turned it over, and found a suit inside. He casually put on the suit, then suddenly stopped after descending a floor. He buttoned up his shirt, opened the fire hydrant in front of him, took out a comb, and started combing his hair. After ensuring his appearance was in order, he took a bag from the fire hydrant, turned a corner, and entered the Trustworthy Pharmaceutical Company.
0:14:56|0:15:8|[Shen Mo] signaled to the three henchmen, who waved goodbye to him. Then [Yao Zong] arrived at the clinic to collect debts, and the doctor looked thoughtfully at the bag on his back.
0:15:48|0:16:14|[Yao Zong] had just left on a tricycle, and the elderly couple who were still receiving treatment at the clinic immediately rushed out without a word, taking a shortcut to catch up. The three of them chased each other, but the elderly woman couldn't run anymore. She said to her husband, "Just as she finished speaking, [Yao Zong] passed by them. The old man quickly followed, sitting down on the road [Yao Zong] was about to pass. Unexpectedly, when he turned the corner, the elderly woman hurried over.
0:16:18|0:16:33|[Yao Zong] is completely unaware of all this, but [Shen Mo] sees everything clearly. [Shen Mo] then returns to the fake medicine factory, where the three henchmen burst into laughter while watching the live broadcast. However, the [Shen Mo] at the back is lost in thought.
0:16:44|0:16:59|When the henchman looked at [Shen Mo], he burst into laughter, but when the henchman turned away, [Shen Mo] returned to his expressionless face.
0:17:39|0:17:50|Wearing a cheongsam with her curly hair pinned up, the female anchor [Ma Xiaoli] finished singing. As people in the live broadcast room started to leave, she did not feel discouraged. She composed herself again and spoke to the audience:
0:17:58|0:18:11|The words were not finished, and all the viewers in the live broadcast room had already left. [Ma Xiaoli] walked out of the room feeling lost. She gently pushed open the door next door, only to see [Lan Lan] dressed in a cute princess outfit, fake singing while acting cute in front of the camera.
0:18:22|0:18:35|[Lan Lan]'s live streaming room is packed with viewers, comments, and flower gifts filling the entire screen. [Ma Xiaoli] stands outside the door, expressionless for a moment, then sadly closes the door. She quietly walks to the kitchen, puts on an apron, picks up a knife, and starts cooking.
0:19:32|0:19:38|Qiqi showed off her low-cut camisole, [Ma Xiaoli] lowered her head and adjusted her own clothes.
0:20:0|0:20:14|[Ma Xiaoli] changed into a cute outfit, but there was still no popularity in the live broadcast room. She sent a message to the only viewer in the room: "Thank you for your support."
0:20:14|0:20:40|The other party only replied with the words "Acting Bible", she quickly asked who the other party was, but the audience did not reply. Instead, they directly turned off the computer. The darkened screen reflected the shadow of [Shen Mo]. He took out a book "Acting Bible" and started writing and drawing on it. Just as he wrote a few words, he was interrupted by a vibrating sound. He picked up his phone and saw that it was a call from Zhu Ge at the restaurant.
0:20:48|0:20:54|The restaurant owner Zhu who ran away earlier was scared and quickly hung up the phone. [Shen Mo] called back.
0:21:2|0:21:13|Zhu Ge watched as the phone call from [Shen Mo] went unanswered, feeling desperate. He knelt in front of the statue of Guan Gong, hoping for blessings, but felt he wasn't sincere enough and asked his wife to kneel with him.
0:21:16|0:21:23|Late at night, the drunken and scantily clad beauty [Xiao Wei] stumbled out of the car and staggered towards the residential area.
0:21:23|0:21:38|On the other side, Shen Mo's accomplice Du Yu was eating and watching Japanese anime. In the anime, the female lead said to the male lead, "Love at first sight is not without reason." Seeing this, Du Yu was so moved that tears almost welled up in his eyes.
0:21:38|0:21:46|At this moment, there was a knock on the door. Shen Mo turned his head towards the door with extreme impatience and then asked:
0:22:0|0:22:22|Opening the door, it was a hug from [Xiao Wei]. [Du Yu] was stunned. He drank with [Xiao Wei], and after clinking glasses, before [Xiao Wei] could put down her cup, [Du Yu] quickly took it from her.
0:22:28|0:22:38|[Du Yu] poured a glass of wine, [Xiao Wei] held the wine glass in contemplation, then raised it up. The two of them then went outside.
0:23:32|0:23:50|[Xiao Wei] finished speaking, and suddenly it started to rain heavily in the sky. [Du Yu] happily opened an umbrella, and the two of them looked like a beautiful picture in the rain. As the day broke, [Shen Mo] had already arrived at Mr. Jia's company for work. He spoke fluent Mandarin and teased the old man and lady on the phone who were trying to scam him by pinching his throat.
0:24:6|0:24:24|[Shen Mo] put down the phone satisfactorily and asked Mr. Jia, who gave him a thumbs up. Looking at the words "transaction successful" on the computer screen, Mr. Jia was first stunned, then clapped his hands and happily stood up.
0:24:34|0:24:48|Ailian responded and walked out, [Shen Mo] then sat down, touched the red dragon fish statue, and unplugged the network cable. The boss sitting in front of the computer without internet frowned and said:
0:25:38|0:25:46|Shen Mo secretly inserted the USB drive into the computer to copy data, when suddenly Mr. Jia looked over at the computer and then turned to him to inquire,
0:26:18|0:26:36|At the same time, the female anchor [Ma Xiaoli] changed her style. She wore a small hat on her head, with slightly curled hair hanging on her shoulders. She put on a cute pig-themed cover for the computer screen. With her eyes closed, she followed the rhythm of the music. The live chat room was flooded with gifts from the audience. She confidently started singing:
0:26:51|0:26:58|On the screen, [Ma Xiaoli] finished singing in one go, feeling very pleased, and then shouted loudly.
0:28:19|0:28:26|[Du Yu] saw that [Shen Mo] remained silent, so he had to change the subject.
0:29:22|0:29:32|Shen Mo threw the tablet in front of Manager Yao, and on the screen was the female anchor Ma Xiaoli, who had received an endorsement invitation. Ma Xiaoli, dressed in formal attire and high heels, emerged from the subway station.
0:29:32|0:29:40|She stumbled after only a few steps due to discomfort in her high heels. She stood at the side of the road, and a scooter passed by her.
0:29:40|0:29:49|She looked behind and saw no other vehicles, so she quickly caught up with the just-departed buggy.
0:30:14|0:30:22|[Shen Mo] in a suit waved to [Ma Xiaoli] and walked towards her with an umbrella, but was stopped by Mr. Jia.
0:31:12|0:31:17|[Du Yu] sat at the front desk and received a message from [Xiao Wei] saying she wanted to drink love soup. He then replied with a silly smile: "Will deliver it later." Not far away,
0:31:17|0:31:22|Yao Zong instructed his henchman:
0:31:30|0:31:36|General Yao was startled by [Ma Xiaoli], who awkwardly took off her sunglasses and looked at General Yao.
0:31:55|0:32:4|[Du Yu] intended to go to the restaurant next door to order food, but as soon as he stepped out, he saw the owner of the restaurant next door closing the shop.
0:32:23|0:32:36|[Du Yu] was completely dumbfounded, while inside the restaurant, [Ma Xiaoli] and Yao Zong also remained silent at the dining table, making the atmosphere extremely awkward. After dealing with Jia Zong, [Shen Mo] hurried to the restaurant. He placed the umbrella in his hand on the front desk and walked up to [Ma Xiaoli].
0:33:43|0:33:59|[Shen Mo] was speaking when he looked up and saw Mr. Jia approaching with his men. About to be exposed, [Shen Mo] quickly reassured [Ma Xiaoli], turned around and walked towards the door. He put on a flattering smile, hurried over to Mr. Jia.
0:34:25|0:34:39|Mr. Jia finished speaking and walked towards the store. Ailian walked up to [Shen Mo] with a stern face and said angrily, "After Ailian left in anger, [Shen Mo]'s expression changed from flattering to sharp, and he followed them.
0:34:39|0:34:47|Mr. Jia greeted [Ma Xiaoli] as soon as he entered the restaurant, then turned to face Ailian.
0:34:56|0:35:1|[Shen Mo], who came in later, deliberately turned up the music in the store and then walked up to [Ma Xiaoli].
0:35:7|0:35:14|[Du Yu] is preparing food in the kitchen, when [Shen Mo] comes in and says to him:
0:35:39|0:35:51|After Du Yu finished speaking, he picked up his phone. Inside the restaurant, General Jia placed a bottle of wine on the table and instructed his subordinates.
0:37:15|0:37:38|In the kitchen, from day to dusk until nightfall, [Du Yu] is busy catching fish and cooking, sometimes even holding two spatulas to cook. For the sake of one hundred thousand yuan, he is really risking his life. He expressionlessly dishes out the dishes, while [Shen Mo] next to him takes the freshly cooked dishes to the customers in the restaurant. He smiles, stands tall, and confidently serves the dishes to [Ma Xiaoli] at the table.
0:37:38|0:37:43|With a fawning smile, [Shen Mo] bowed and handed the dishes to the table of [Mr. Jia].
0:37:43|0:38:1|[Jia Zong] raised his glass and stood up when he saw the situation, [Shen Mo] obediently clinked glasses with [Jia Zong] and colleagues, while the unfortunate [Du Yu] tirelessly cooked in the kitchen. In the modern city, the tablecloths and decorations in the restaurant were all made of the large flower cloth from Northeast China, just like him, completely out of place with the city.
0:38:1|0:38:22|Shen Mo repeated the steps of serving dishes to everyone over and over again. Facing two different tables, he switched between different expressions and identities skillfully. He calmly faced two different groups of people with different identities, showing his confidence when facing Ma Xiaoli and his flattery when facing Mr. Jia. Which one is the real him?
0:38:22|0:38:25|He probably doesn't even know himself.
0:38:25|0:38:36|He is like an actor who has won numerous honors, using two different emotions and expressions in real life to interpret the perfect performance in his heart.
0:38:37|0:38:54|After serving the last dish to two tables, [Shen Mo] walked up to [Jia Zong] and his colleagues' table, raised his glass to toast them, then returned to the table with [Ma Xiaoli] and Yao Zong. He calmly sat down at the table, then casually crossed his legs in a relaxed manner.
0:38:54|0:39:6|[Shen Mo] was talking to [Ma Xiaoli] about the follow-up plan for his product endorsement, while [Du Yu] in the kitchen frying dishes, listened to him and looked over with a speechless expression.
0:39:45|0:39:52|Mr. Jia smiled awkwardly twice after listening to Shen Mo's words, then spoke:
0:40:31|0:40:39|Shen Mo turned his head and saw the two holding hands tightly. His sharp eyes stared at them, and only when Yao released his hand did he turn to look at Jia.
0:40:46|0:40:55|[Ma Xiaoli] looked at [Shen Mo] in the mirror and smiled knowingly. As they walked on the street, [Shen Mo] asked [Ma Xiaoli]:
0:41:28|0:41:44|[Ma Xiaoli] suddenly twisted her ankle. Just as she was about to fall, [Shen Mo] hooked a foot on a tree and grabbed her with one hand, saving her from danger. After a while, [Shen Mo] suddenly spoke, with a nosebleed flowing as he talked.
0:41:45|0:42:0|The two arrived at the roadside, with [Ma Xiaoli] holding her high heels trying to hail a cab. After a while without success, she had no choice but to sit back on a stone bench by the street. [Shen Mo] was beside her, tilting his head back to wipe his nosebleed. Seeing [Ma Xiaoli] returning empty-handed, he thought for a moment before speaking:
0:42:55|0:43:16|[Shen Mo] watched as the taxi drove away, the smile on his face gradually fading. On the other side, [Du Yu] carried the stew he had cooked in his hands and knocked on a door. At that moment, an expensive luxury car pulled up downstairs, and a burly middle-aged man got out of the car. His bodyguards held umbrellas as they escorted this extraordinary big shot into the building. Meanwhile, the door in front of [Du Yu] upstairs was opened.
0:43:16|0:43:22|He looked at Xiao Wei inside the room and exclaimed with surprise:
0:43:42|0:43:58|[Du Yu] awkwardly said after hearing this: [Du Yu] couldn't laugh anymore, and could only nod blankly.
0:43:58|0:44:24|At the same time, the elevator that the boss was riding stopped on their floor. As he walked out of the elevator and turned the corner, [Du Yu] passed by carrying a bowl of noodles expressionlessly and got on the elevator. On the other side, [Xiao Wei] leaned against the door, crying and wiping her tears. Upon hearing a knock on the door, she quickly forced a smile, turned around, and opened the door, only to find the boss who had just gone upstairs standing outside.
0:44:25|0:44:31|The boss finished speaking and immediately tore [Xiao Wei]'s clothes, then he walked into the inner room without any concern.
0:44:32|0:44:41|At the restaurant, as the dinner was not over yet, General Yao staggered towards General Jia with a wine glass in hand, only to be noticed by [Shen Mo], who had just brought Ma Xiaoli back.
0:45:3|0:45:14|Mr. Yao immediately threw the wine glass and said, "Seeing the two about to fight, [Shen Mo] quickly picked up a wine glass at the front desk and smashed it on the ground."
0:45:38|0:46:8|[Shen Mo] had a bad feeling and directly overturned the table. Mr. Yao, seeing the situation, quickly ran away, almost bumping into [Du Yu] who was returning with soup. [Shen Mo] burst into tears with a wrinkled face, [Du Yu] hurriedly approached and said, helping the pretending-to-be-unwell [Shen Mo] to leave.
0:46:14|0:46:22|At the closed restaurant at night, [Du Yu] said to [Shen Mo]:
0:46:41|0:46:56|[Du Yu] kicked over a bottle after hearing this, then sat down on a stool dejectedly. [Shen Mo] opened the rolling shutter and coldly said to him: He finished his words with his back to [Du Yu], and at that moment, his nose started bleeding. He casually wiped it away without caring.
0:46:56|0:47:13|[Du Yu] looked at his back and didn't see his embarrassed look. [Shen Mo] then left expressionlessly. Suddenly, a notification sound rang. [Du Yu] took out his phone from his pocket and stared at the screen for a moment. The one sending the text asking him to get lost was [Xiao Wei], asking him to teach her how to make soup.
0:47:13|0:47:26|[Du Yu] looked at the text message and couldn't help but smile. In the distance, a car passed by the front of the restaurant, where [Du Yu] inside was excitedly dancing with a broom, like a chubby butterfly dancing in a flower garden.
0:47:26|0:47:33|The sky gradually brightened, and [Ma Xiaoli] and her sisters were leisurely practicing yoga at home. At that moment, she suddenly spoke up and asked:
0:47:43|0:48:14|The sisters' words made [Ma Xiaoli] feel embarrassed. She cleared her mind and focused on practicing yoga. After finishing, she stepped on the scale and it showed 122.55 pounds, which made her very distressed. She didn't believe it, so she tapped the scale. Looking at the scale in distress, [Ma Xiaoli] suddenly seemed to remember something and turned her gaze to the weight loss pills given to her by [Shen Mo]. After taking them, she indeed had stomach issues.
0:49:9|0:49:16|The head of the agency handed a business card to [Shen Mo], who looked at it and quipped:
0:49:27|0:49:42|[Shen Mo] turned around and saw [Ma Xiaoli], dressed in a waitress uniform. [Shen Mo] smiled.
0:49:49|0:49:56|[Ma Xiaoli] finished speaking and turned to leave. The woman next to her looked at [Shen Mo] as if mocking him. [Shen Mo] ran after [Ma Xiaoli].
0:49:56|0:49:58|Taking out two cucumbers, he said to her:
0:50:22|0:50:27|Walking back to her home, Shen Mo returned and sat on the toilet exhaustedly holding weight loss pills. There was a knock on the bathroom door.
0:50:38|0:50:51|On the other side, [Shen Mo] was sitting in the kitchen of the restaurant washing vegetables. She saw [Ma Xiaoli] and her two sisters walking towards them from a distance. She said something to [Du Yu], who was playing on his phone. Upon hearing her, [Du Yu] immediately started cutting vegetables. At that moment, a customer came up to him and said,
0:50:54|0:51:5|The customer inexplicably turned and left, [Shen Mo] walked to the garbage pile holding the trash, and said to [Ma Xiaoli] and others who were heading home:
0:51:23|0:51:32|[Lan Lan] also followed closely, saying, "[Shen Mo] helped them carry things back home, looking exhausted."
0:52:1|0:52:13|[Lan Lan] awkwardly smiled, waved goodbye, before finishing her sentence, she locked [Shen Mo] outside the door. [Shen Mo] outside the door regained his expressionless state, turned around and left. Just then, the door suddenly opened, and [Ma Xiaoli] urgently asked:
0:53:1|0:53:7|[Shen Mo] smiled and said to her with a very serious expression:
0:53:44|0:53:49|He picked up a receipt from the Angel Foundation remittance, and after putting it down, he continued, saying:
0:54:17|0:54:30|[Ma Xiaoli] finished speaking and then saw a cockroach. [Shen Mo] held up insecticide and sprayed wildly. [Ma Xiaoli] pulled him away and then bravely stomped on it.
0:54:30|0:54:37|After returning home, [Shen Mo] flipped through the script, feeling a bit bored. He put down the book and got up to walk out.
0:54:37|0:54:43|On the other side, Ma Xiaoli is eating snacks, Lan Lan suddenly asks her,
0:55:46|0:56:10|After hanging up the phone, [Shen Mo] turned to signal to his colleague, who gave a thumbs-up gesture. Mr. Jia next to him also raised his thumb in approval. However, [Shen Mo] then turned back with a slightly dark expression on his face. He reminded [Du Yu], who was playing on his phone in the restaurant. Later, he noticed [Ma Xiaoli] and others eating at the restaurant. As he was about to leave but was seen by someone, he had to strike up a conversation.
0:56:32|0:56:47|In the midst of laughter, [Du Yu] suddenly turned his head and reprimanded: the restaurant next door has temporarily closed, [Shen Mo] is standing at the door with a list in hand, looking puzzled,
0:57:5|0:57:11|[Shen Mo] frantically gestured towards [Du Yu], and finally [Du Yu], unable to bear it any longer, shouted at him loudly:
0:57:32|0:57:40|In the kitchen, [Shen Mo] is so clumsy that she even knocks over a bowl while frying an egg. [Du Yu], who has just entered the kitchen, can't stand it and speaks up.
0:58:21|0:58:29|[Ma Xiaoli] smiled and turned to the kitchen. As she entered the kitchen, her smile gradually faded. [Shen Mo] silently watched her from behind.
0:58:41|0:58:50|[Shen Mo] turned and entered the kitchen, where [Ma Xiaoli] was crying sadly. When she saw [Shen Mo] coming in, she quickly turned around to wipe away her tears. [Shen Mo] looked at her with a heavy heart.
0:59:27|0:59:38|Seeing [Shen Mo] remaining silent, [Ma Xiaoli] continued to cook with her head down, while sarcastically commenting: "After she finishes sorting out her emotions, she will walk out of the kitchen with a smile."
0:59:44|0:59:51|As the sky darkens, [Xiao Wei] stands on the balcony, anxiously making a phone call.
1:0:12|1:0:34|[Xiao Wei] nervously took the phone and hung up without waiting for the big shot to finish speaking, unaware that every move of hers was being monitored and transmitted to the other party. Meanwhile, inside the room, [Du Yu] was lying on the bed playing games. He casually turned off the news notification about the mysterious tycoon [He Dachang] being involved in illegal activities. [Du Yu] cursed under his breath and continued playing games, completely unaware that there was a photo of [He Dachang] on the bedside table. Returning from the balcony, [Xiao Wei] hesitated to speak.
1:1:10|1:1:24|The phone smashed the screen on the TV cabinet. He angrily flicked the cigarette to the ground and picked up the landline phone to dial a number, then said familiarly:
1:1:53|1:2:20|Hearing the phone ring, [He Dachang] hurried to pick up the phone he had just thrown on the TV cabinet. Just as he stood up, he stepped on the cigarette butt he had thrown, then, because he didn't stand steady, he hit his head on the TV cabinet and passed out. Meanwhile, [Du Yu] left [Xiao Wei]'s house and walked behind [Shen Mo] asking for money.
1:3:12|1:3:31|Upon hearing the warning from [Shen Mo], [Du Yu] angrily left. Meanwhile, [Shen Mo] was writing at the desk while reminiscing about his childhood experiences. He recalled a memory of a heartless merchant scattering iron nails on the road, causing a car to accidentally run over them from a distance. Coincidentally, a tractor was driving in the opposite direction on a one-way street, leading the car to flip over in order to avoid the tractor.
1:3:31|1:3:40|The tractor driver got off to check the situation, then drove away, while the adults in the car helped the young [Shen Mo] wipe the blood off his face.
1:4:25|1:4:37|In the dimly lit hallway at night, [Shen Mo] arrived alone at the door of [Ma Xiaoli]'s room. Just as he was about to knock, he felt a tickle in his throat. He bent over, covering his mouth and nose, coughing. Unable to hold it in, he squatted down and continued coughing.
1:4:38|1:4:45|[Shen Mo] looked at the things he coughed up without any concern, stood up and prepared to leave, he was like a walking dead.
1:4:45|1:4:51|At that moment, Ma Xiaoli, who was taking out the trash, saw his figure and called out to him.
1:6:16|1:6:21|The two actors' humorous performance amused the audience in front of the computer. The next moment, Yao Zong slapped his subordinate, and then they arrived at the entrance of the restaurant. He took out his phone and called [Shen Mo].
1:6:24|1:6:30|[Shen Mo] glanced at the phone when it rang, saw that it was Yao Dezhi, and casually set the phone aside.
1:6:32|1:6:39|Picking up the landline next to him, [Shen Mo] dialed Mr. Yao, then took out a tissue and placed it on the microphone before speaking:
1:8:1|1:8:27|After winning this round, General Jia handed two large trophies to [Shen Mo]. [Shen Mo] shyly smiled as she accepted the trophies, while the surrounding employees looked on with envy. On the other side, the Japanese assassin Yuan Pengjun smuggled into China by boat. He opened the front of the boat and took out a briefcase, inside of which was a bank card and several photos of [Du Yu] and [Xiao Wei]. Yuan Pengjun walked down the street with his luggage, his handsome appearance catching the attention of the news anchor [Lan Lan], who struck up a conversation with him.
1:8:57|1:9:10|[Lan Lan] put her arm around Yuan Pengjun's shoulder and led him into the elevator. The elevator doors opened, and Yuan Pengjun walked out first, with [Lan Lan] following closely behind. She leaned against the elevator, pressing the button and watching Yuan Pengjun.
1:9:16|1:9:26|After confirming [Lan Lan] had left, Yuan Pengjun turned and entered the room, without exploring the new environment inside. Instead, he sat down at the table and skillfully began assembling his high-end telescope.
1:9:28|1:9:40|Then he took it to the balcony, looked across to the opposite floor for a while, and finally found the target he was going to kill this time. He looked at the seemingly dead [Xiao Wei] and [Du Yu] with an evil smile on his face.
1:9:47|1:10:1|[Xiao Wei] paced back and forth in the room muttering to herself, while [Du Yu] remained calm in front of the computer. On the other side, Yuan Pengjun checked his balance at the bank, entered his password, and smiled satisfactorily when he saw a balance of 5 million.
1:10:2|1:10:28|As soon as he left, [Du Yu] had already transferred the balance from his card to his own account, while [Shen Mo] at the computer received the news of the huge sum transferred to [Du Yu]. He closed the computer and walked out of the room. Yuan Pengjun was buying medicine at the hospital, handing his bank card to the doctor. The doctor, however, was impatient. Yuan Pengjun, who was smiling, was instantly stunned. He had just checked the balance at the bank, which had 5 million in the card, now only had 10 yuan left.
1:10:29|1:10:45|He angrily took out the card, walked out of the bank, but met [Shen Mo] who was about to enter at the door. After a brief confrontation, they both left on their own. [Shen Mo] removed the mini surveillance device and fake plug stuck on [Du Yu] at the self-service ATM, then turned and left the bank.
1:10:50|1:11:5|Yuan Pengjun called He Dachang to inquire about his bank card balance, unaware that He Dachang had just fallen near the TV cabinet after stepping on a cigarette butt barefoot. Now he could only watch the phone ring without any sensation to answer the call.
1:11:5|1:11:17|Returning home, [Shen Mo] poured the medicine onto the small balance, mixed it with other white powder in a beaker, stirred it, then lit the alcohol lamp. After completing all this, he revealed an evil smile.
1:11:17|1:11:34|When he got the finished white powder, he fantasized about [Xiao Wei] and [Du Yu] following his orders to ingest it. He imagined them foaming at the mouth, ceasing to breathe, and then he would disguise them as if they had killed each other, in order to conceal the fact that he was the real murderer.
1:11:34|1:11:52|Thinking of this, Shen Mo smiled knowingly. Unexpectedly, someone knocked on the door at this moment. He put away his smile, got up to open the door, and saw Lan Lan standing there holding a cake. Seeing Yuan Pengjun opening the door, she joyfully said:
1:12:0|1:12:7|After saying that, she entered [Yuan Pengjun]'s room.
1:12:28|1:12:52|On one side, [Shen Mo] is drinking with Boss Jia in the restaurant, while on the other side, [Yuan Pengjun] is making juice by the window with his back to [Lan Lan]. [Lan Lan] is taking selfies with her phone at the table, capturing herself and [Yuan Pengjun] from behind. When she's not looking, [Yuan Pengjun] secretly pours the fake weight-loss pills sold by [Shen Mo] into the tea. The reflection on the window reveals his successful conspiracy.
1:12:53|1:13:9|He poured tea into a cup, turned around and walked to the table, handed the tea with weight-loss pills to [Lan Lan], smiled as he watched her drink it. After [Lan Lan] finished drinking, she hesitated for a moment and said:
1:13:53|1:14:13|[Yuan Pengjun] angrily licked his lips, picked up a box of Lishen weight loss pills, and [Lan Lan], who heard the commotion, ran over and asked: [Yuan Pengjun] pulled down the necklace around his neck, swayed it in front of [Lan Lan], and began to hypnotize her. He chanted: Look here, look carefully here, relax slowly,
1:15:5|1:15:27|[Ma Xiaoli] was so worried about [Lan Lan] that she went out to look for her. Qi Qi, feeling unhappy because of her words, stayed at home sulking. On the other side, [Lan Lan] was hypnotized by [Yuan Pengjun]. She walked while taking off her clothes, then nakedly got into the bathtub. Finally, she picked up a blade and cut open the vein on her left wrist. Meanwhile, [Yuan Pengjun] stood by the window watching every move of [Du Yu] and [Xiao Wei].
1:15:27|1:15:36|They noticed their movements, and [Yuan Pengjun] also began to prepare. Inside the restaurant.
1:15:36|1:15:48|[Shen Mo] is alone in front of the computer transferring the funds of Light Years account. Mr. Jia and the employees are getting drunk at the dining table. Mr. Jia, just a wall away, is drunk and lying on the table. Ailian calls out to him, but he doesn't respond.
1:15:52|1:16:0|After a satisfying meal, the group from the scam company helped each other as they left the restaurant with Boss Jia. However, they encountered Ma Xiaoli, who was looking for Lan Lan, on the way.
1:16:0|1:16:34|On the other side, [Du Yu] and [Xiao Wei] just entered the elevator with their suitcases, while [Yuan Pengjun] came out from another elevator. The three brushed past each other, and inside the elevator, [Du Yu] found out that a large sum of money had been transferred out of his account. He gradually stopped smiling, and [Xiao Wei], seeing his expression, asked worriedly. [Yuan Pengjun] opened the door to the corridor, but slipped and fell. He got up and continued walking.
1:16:53|1:17:6|Du Yu, heartbroken, didn't realize his true love had been seduced and taken away by Yuan Pengjun. Yuan Pengjun called He Dachang, but he didn't answer.
1:17:13|1:17:20|He Dachang's phone fell down because of an incoming call vibration.
1:17:28|1:17:35|The elderly couple who stage accidents for compensation are also here. [Shen Mo] is submitting a report while listening to [Du Yu].
1:17:59|1:18:19|[Du Yu] had just finished speaking when Yuan Pengjun excitedly stepped on the gas pedal, ready to ram into him. At that moment, the elderly couple who staged the accident suddenly appeared. [Du Yu] witnessed this scene with his own eyes, the sound of the impact reaching [Shen Mo] through the phone receiver. The car hit a tree and came to a stop, leaving only the unconscious Yuan Pengjun inside. [Du Yu] quickly carried [Xiao Wei] and rushed to the hospital.
1:18:19|1:18:24|The elderly couple knew they had caused trouble and quickly left the scene of the accident.
1:18:27|1:18:32|[Shen Mo] arrived at the scene to check on Yuan Pengjun's injuries, followed by [Ma Xiaoli].
1:18:44|1:18:59|[Shen Mo] took the phone handed to him by [Ma Xiaoli], enlarged the picture and looked at it thoughtfully. After a moment, he said to [Ma Xiaoli]: "Drunk Mr. Jia is lying on the clinic bed, talking nonsense."
1:19:24|1:19:44|Seeing [Xiao Wei] regain consciousness, [Du Yu] frantically searched through the medical supplies nearby for something to treat her. Meanwhile, [Shen Mo] stood downstairs in the residential area comparing the location in the picture on his phone. On the other side, [Ma Xiaoli] was still guarding the scene of the accident. Before long, Yuan Pengjun woke up from unconsciousness. Seeing this, [Ma Xiaoli] quickly approached and asked:
1:19:58|1:20:14|Yuan Pengjun ignored [Ma Xiaoli]'s questions and got up to leave, while [Shen Mo] stood in the hallway. He took out tools from his pocket and started working on Yuan Pengjun's door. In no time, he successfully pried open the door and walked in confidently, then carefully closed the door behind him.
1:20:15|1:20:23|[Shen Mo] entered the room and walked to the table, where he removed the half-eaten cake on top. Several newspapers underneath caught his attention.
1:20:23|1:20:28|The newspaper reported that the president of the Yamaguchi-gumi was killed in an izakaya, and the suspects include Kitano Ichiro and others.
1:20:34|1:20:45|He then came to the window and saw through the telescope that [Yuan Pengjun] had been monitoring [Du Yu]. His face was solemn as he pondered something. On the other side, [Ma Xiaoli] followed [Yuan Pengjun] to the clinic where [Du Yu] was located. She kept talking incessantly:
1:21:3|1:21:9|A doctor walked out of the room at this time,
1:21:16|1:21:28|[Yuan Pengjun] knocked out all the doctors who came out, locked the clinic door from the inside, and walked from the inside of the clinic. Inside the house, General Jia was still talking to the employees about corporate culture.
1:21:50|1:22:4|He then closed the door and put on the white coat hanging on the hanger. At the same time, [Shen Mo] finally found [Lan Lan] lying in the bathtub with her wrists cut in the bathroom.
1:22:9|1:22:20|Walking into the room, [Yuan Pengjun] did not pay attention to Mr. Jia's wailing, but went straight towards [Du Yu]. With his back to him, [Du Yu] was only concerned about [Xiao Wei]'s injury, completely unaware that danger was silently approaching.
1:22:20|1:22:37|On the other side, [Shen Mo] quickly found sandpaper and tape to provide basic first aid for the severely bleeding [Lan Lan]. Then, she called [Ma Xiaoli], but the voice on the other end was cold. [Shen Mo] hung up the phone immediately, dialed another number, and then grabbed a towel and headed towards the bathtub.
1:23:3|1:23:17|Shen Mo shouted loudly, then he put Lan Lan into the ambulance and asked the doctor, Shen Mo hesitated for a moment, then shouted loudly:
1:23:28|1:23:58|[Du Yu] followed [Yuan Pengjun]'s instructions with a knife in hand and walked towards Mr. Jia. After intimidating Mr. Jia, [Du Yu] turned the knife towards [Xiao Wei]. Meanwhile, [Shen Mo] was looking at the map on his phone on the street, then he called [Du Yu]. Hearing the ringtone, [Yuan Pengjun] picked up the phone, which showed an incoming call from Cold Blood. As the phone kept ringing, he reluctantly answered the call.
1:23:58|1:24:14|Shen Mo sensed something was wrong when the other party remained silent, so he started to act. He pretended to be the top Japanese assassin and talked to [Yuan Pengjun].
1:24:34|1:25:4|I am the number one assassin in Japan. If you dare to insult me, I will kill you along with [Yuan Pengjun]. [Yuan Pengjun] replied: I am Yuan Peng from Henggang, I am waiting for you here. Unable to bear it, [Yuan Pengjun] slapped [Du Yu], who was struggling with a human statue, causing him to faint. The people around looked at the unconscious [Du Yu] and dared not speak. On the other side, [Shen Mo] ran towards the clinic with a nosebleed. [Yuan Pengjun] stood in the clinic, looking down at the group of people inside.
1:25:4|1:25:26|At this moment, the sound of the clinic door being unlocked was heard. He suddenly looked over there, and the people inside the room also turned to look at the door. [Shen Mo] walked in through the door in front of everyone's eyes, shocking everyone. Despite the stunned looks, [Shen Mo] ignored them and leisurely walked into the room, pretending to be a Chinese expatriate from Japan. Only then did he speak:
1:25:29|1:25:34|Everyone was stunned after hearing this, [Shen Mo] then said to Yuan Pengjun,
1:26:12|1:26:20|Yuan Pengjun frowned and turned to look at [Shen Mo].
1:26:32|1:26:47|The hypocritical person, [Shen Mo], upon hearing these words, his hand hanging by his side trembled slightly, then clenched his fist, calmly said to Yuan Pengjun: After you. Yuan Pengjun walked out of the room first, [Shen Mo] gave a slight smile to [Ma Xiaoli], then walked out and closed the door behind him.
1:26:47|1:26:56|The two arrived in the clinic lobby ready to settle the score. [Shen Mo] took out a brick from his pocket and quietly approached Yuan Pengjun, who had his back turned, intending to strike and win in one blow.
1:26:56|1:27:3|Who knew that Yuan Pengjun was well prepared, and with a kick, he brought him to his knees on the ground.
1:27:16|1:27:28|Yuan Pengjun completely ignored what [Shen Mo] said, and directly delivered a side kick, leaving him disoriented. In the end, he knocked [Shen Mo] to the ground.
1:27:28|1:27:37|Immediately, Yuan Pengjun stepped forward quickly, lifted [Shen Mo] and threw her against the wall, saying triumphantly:
1:27:41|1:28:11|After saying that, he lifted [Shen Mo] up again and threw him hard onto the nearby medicine shelf. [Shen Mo] was not lightly thrown this time. Yuan Pengjun still felt unsatisfied. When [Shen Mo] staggered to stand up, Yuan Pengjun stepped on the table, took off his robe, and then kicked him into another room. The noise woke up [Du Yu], who held a knife and pointed it at [Xiao Wei].
1:28:44|1:28:49|[Du Yu] said that [Shen Mo], who used to be good at fighting, is now beaten by Yuan Pengjun and can't stand up.
1:29:18|1:29:34|[Shen Mo] confirmed that Yuan Pengjun was indeed the number one assassin in Japan. Not only did he block his attacks, but he also swiftly knocked him to the ground. It turns out that he had been pretending to be weak all along, trying to extract information from Yuan Pengjun about being the number one assassin in Japan.
1:29:34|1:29:49|Shen Mo, without any hesitation, seemed to be possessed by the God of War, countering all of Yuan Pengjun's moves one by one. In the end, he kicked him to the ground, clearly gaining the upper hand in this fight. He expressed his anger in Japanese at this moment.
1:29:50|1:30:0|[Ma Xiaoli] and others were self-rescuing in the house. At this moment, Yuan Pengjun opened the door and walked in. Ma Xiaoli quickly stepped forward and punched Yuan Pengjun, making him kneel on the ground. Then she hysterically shouted:
1:30:17|1:30:30|Shen Mo and Ma Xiaoli helped each other leave, while Ailian shouted unwillingly from behind. Outside the door, Yao Zong rode a tricycle with his little brothers towards them, and the old men and women who staged accidents targeted them again.
1:30:49|1:30:57|Mr. Yao slammed on the brakes in a hurry, but the old man took a few steps and lay down in front of the car. Mr. Yao quickly reversed the car.
1:31:10|1:31:26|Yao and others arrived at the clinic and found it in a mess. The henchman said, "Yao noticed Yuan Pengjun sitting at the door and kicked him."
1:31:34|1:31:43|The alarm bell rang at this moment, leaving Yao and the others stunned, while those still trapped in the clinic, including Jia, burst into laughter joyfully.
1:31:46|1:31:59|The hotel owner who had run away before returned to his small shop with luggage. His wife put down the luggage and looked around. She saw a bankbook on the front desk and quickly called her husband over to look at it.
1:32:59|1:33:11|Faced with Ma Xiaoli's confession, Shen Mo could only pretend to be dumbfounded. Ma Xiaoli also realized and said:
1:33:23|1:33:28|[Ma Xiaoli] slowly closes the door, and the two of them exchange a smile through the crack in the door.
1:33:33|1:33:58|Shen Mo thought about what Ma Xiaoli had said, feeling fortunate in his heart. Little did he know that Ma Xiaoli's words were heartfelt. Shen Mo's expression gradually became heavy as he left Ma Xiaoli's place. He took off the waiter's clothes as he walked, revealing a suit underneath. He also put on a huge backpack halfway through, slowly disappearing into the corridor. Ma Xiaoli walked into her sisters' room feeling lost. Qiqi saw her and exclaimed excitedly:
1:34:21|1:34:43|She recalled the time when she left her pen at the bank while filling out a remittance form, and [Shen Mo] accidentally took her pen because his pen couldn't write. It turned out that the two had already met. Shortly after, the mysterious wealthy businessman [He Dachang], who died from a fall, was reported in the news as having died from taking a selfie with his phone.
1:34:45|1:34:53|The lovebirds [Du Yu] and [Xiao Wei] who plan to go abroad, come to an immigration company for consultation.
1:35:15|1:35:22|The two of them exchanged a smile in good spirits, while [Shen Mo], disguised as a professional, walked slowly in the hallway.
1:35:28|1:35:52|He picked out the best country for [Du Yu] and the other person, thinking that this would be the last thing he could do for him. Then he took off his casual glasses and beard, and spat out the round beads that changed his facial shape from his mouth. He casually threw these things into the nearby trash can, and then without hesitation, he slowly opened the door to the top floor.
1:36:13|1:36:25|In the midst of silence, [Shen Mo] strides resolutely towards the edge of the top floor, with the city lights casting an illusory glow. Below him lies a bustling street, and with one more step forward, he will plunge into the abyss.
1:36:25|1:36:34|At this moment, Ma Xiaoli's phone rang. He glanced down at the phone on the ground but didn't answer. On the other end of the line, Ma Xiaoli complained:
