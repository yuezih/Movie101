0:1:24|0:1:33|In January 1949, the People's Liberation Army of China surrounded the Nationalist Party's 500,000 troops in Beijing and Tianjin.
0:1:33|0:1:40|The final attack of the Pingjin Campaign is imminent, whether or not Beiping can be peacefully liberated depends on the Battle of Tianjin.
0:1:43|0:2:4|At this moment in the city of Tianjin, with hidden treasures attacking everywhere, the reconnaissance soldier [Ma Baoshu] from the People's Liberation Army Artillery Reconnaissance Company dashed into a defensive high-rise building to avoid the bullets from the high-altitude platform opposite. However, a mortar shell came straight through the blasted window, almost blowing [Ma Baoshu] out of the high-rise. Fortunately, his comrades pulled him back into the building just in time.
0:2:6|0:2:10|Rescuing Ma Baoshu were his platoon leader Cai Xingfu and his comrades in the platoon, Ermao.
0:2:10|0:2:19|Facing the gunshots from the high-rise building across the street, before the three of them could catch their breath, [Cai Xingfu] quickly patted [Ma Baoshu] on the shoulder, signaling to hurry to the top of the building to take cover.
0:2:19|0:2:28|Three of them hid under a low wall on the rooftop, with [Cai Xingfu] and [Ma Baoshu] peeking out to observe the enemy's firepower, then raising their rifles to fire at the enemy troops.
0:2:55|0:3:2|In an instant, two shells were accurately launched towards the stronghold, with [Cai Xingfu] giving a thumbs-up and aiming at a high point.
0:3:8|0:3:21|The enemy stronghold at the high ground was quickly destroyed, with the precise ranging by [Cai Xingfu], the PLA's shells continuously destroyed the enemy firepower strongholds, and finally the main force of the PLA successfully captured this area.
0:3:21|0:3:31|[Cai Xingfu], [Yao Zhe], and [Mei Yan] successfully evacuated from the rooftop. [Ma Baoshu] took out a piece of cake from his bag as they walked, each taking a bite in turn, before the screen faded to black.
0:3:40|0:3:49|[Cai Xingfu] returned to the camp of the People's Liberation Army.
0:3:58|0:4:0|The rookie glanced at [Cai Xingfu].
0:4:14|0:4:19|To minimize the damage to Tianjin city, we must make precise strikes.
0:4:24|0:4:29|The defense system in Tianjin, Chen Changjie spent 25 billion francs, which is different from Jinzhou and Changchun.
0:4:41|0:4:45|In the Nanma Road prison, the political prisoners who were previously detained have all been transferred.
0:4:47|0:4:51|Underground is an arsenal, with vehicles coming and going as usual in the past few days.
0:5:10|0:5:17|Four days away from the Tianjin headquarters, the soldiers in the camp were shouting loudly while reinforcing the defensive trenches.
0:5:22|0:5:26|A wave of main infantry is practicing attacking marksmanship against scarecrows.
0:5:26|0:5:29|The red flag in the camp flutters in the wind.
0:5:29|0:5:32|On the other side, the Nationalist Army flags are planted on the Zhongzheng Bridge.
0:5:32|0:5:37|A military medical truck closely followed a wave of Nationalist infantry troops as they drove across the bridge.
0:5:37|0:5:41|In the car are [Cai Xingfu] and [Ma Baoshu].
0:5:49|0:5:56|Two Kuomintang soldiers immediately ran to the back of the truck, lifted the rear curtain, and found two soldiers covered in blood and flesh inside the truck, then they reported to their superior officer with relief.
0:6:0|0:6:22|The truck smoothly drove into the military camp, it was a harsh winter day with sporadic snowflakes falling from the sky. [Ma Baoshu] was driving the truck, and he and [Cai Xingfu] saw many captured PLA soldiers along the road in the camp. Some were tied to lampposts, some were bound and kneeling on the steps, a heartbreaking sight.
0:6:25|0:6:34|The scene shifts, and Nationalist Army officer [Yao Zhe] puts his daughter on the boat.
0:6:34|0:6:44|Many ordinary people carrying luggage, rushing towards a ship at the port.
0:6:44|0:6:50|[Yao Zhe] helped the little boy retrieve his trumpet, and the boy followed the crowd surging towards the ships at the harbor, where people were fighting to board.
0:6:51|0:6:59|With Yao Zhe's loud shout, the ship was about to leave Tianjin Port, but before it could fully depart, it suddenly capsized.
0:6:59|0:7:5|[Yao Zhe] and his daughter were also separated, and people on the boat were falling into the water one after another.
0:7:5|0:7:9|This is a memory of [Yao Zhe].
0:7:9|0:7:15|Nationalist Kuomintang military police battalion commander Qian Zhuoqun is shaving his beard in front of the mirror.
0:7:15|0:7:17|[Yao Zhe] timidly walked into the room.
0:7:51|0:7:54|[Yao Zhe] quietly took the official seal on the table and stamped it on a pastry.
0:8:37|0:8:47|The two looked out the window, among the crowd of military officers' families outside, a little girl looked towards [Yao Zhe] in the house.
0:9:18|0:9:28|The person at the front table puts down the knife and fork.
0:9:28|0:9:31|A young boy from the military officer's family runs to the quarantine border holding a ball.
0:9:37|0:9:40|[Yao Zhe] came out from the front table and found the deputy officer of the military station, [Wan San].
0:9:40|0:9:43|[Wan San] handed the car keys to [Yao Zhe].
0:10:3|0:10:12|[Yao Zhe] handed the pastry with a seal to [Wan San], who nodded in acknowledgment.
0:10:12|0:10:14|Then he quickly walked away.
0:10:14|0:10:25|At night, at the hidden door on the second underground floor, a small iron ring slowly moves up from the gap in the window cover, pushing the latch to gradually open the window cover.
0:11:0|0:11:8|The secret door opened, [Yao Zhe] cautiously poked his head out, looked around, saw no one in sight, then quickly picked up his daughter and ran towards the back door.
0:11:8|0:11:14|At this moment, a truck is parked on the empty street outside the back door.
0:11:14|0:11:24|In a tall building in the distance, [Cai Xingfu] and his comrades were observing all this through a telescope.
0:11:24|0:11:26|At this moment, [Yao Zhe] has entered a bar.
0:11:32|0:11:52|Yao Zhe walked towards the bar counter at Wansan, while outside the bar, Cai Xingfu and Ma Baoshu had also driven there. Seeing nobody on the truck parked outside the main entrance of the bar, Cai Xingfu turned his head and glanced at the open Emi Bar, then walked in with Ma Baoshu.
0:11:52|0:11:57|In the bar, the owner of the bar quickly approached the two men disguised as military officers, [Cai Xingfu].
0:12:14|0:12:20|[Ma Baoshu] picked up the bottle of wine and looked at it, while [Cai Xingfu] calmly tapped on [Ma Baoshu]'s bottle, indicating him to drink.
0:12:20|0:12:27|[Ma Baoshu] took a big sip, put down the bottle, gave a signal to [Cai Xingfu], and walked towards the door of the bar.
0:12:27|0:12:31|The bar owner handed a cigarette to [Cai Xingfu], who took it.
0:13:10|0:13:18|Wan San took out a small notebook from his bag, which was his pass to leave Tianjin. He took the pass and was about to leave the restroom when he pulled out a gun.
0:13:47|0:13:52|[Yao Zhe] took the gun.
0:13:52|0:13:58|After Wan San left, [Yao Zhe] held the gun for a long time, then walked out of the restroom.
0:13:58|0:14:4|At this moment, [Cai Xingfu] sitting at the bar noticed that [Yao Zhe] was about to leave the bar.
0:14:4|0:14:9|When [Yao Zhe] walked out of the bar, ready to drive away, [Cai Xingfu] quickly came out of the bar and caught up with him.
0:14:16|0:14:19|[Cai Xingfu] grabs [Yao Zhe] and points a gun at him.
0:14:19|0:14:25|[Ma Baoshu] appears from behind [Yao Zhe] and ties his hands with a rope.
0:14:25|0:14:36|[Yao Zhe]'s daughter peeks out from the back of the car.
0:14:36|0:14:40|[Ma Baoshu] quickly threw a flying knife, hitting the soldier holding a gun directly.
0:14:40|0:14:41|The soldier pulled the trigger as he fell to the ground.
0:14:43|0:15:11|Standing on top of a tall building, Ermao and Xiaoge saw Cai Xingfu driving towards the border blockade zone. The soldiers raised their guns alertly towards the direction of the car. Inside the car, Yao Zhe, who was bound, saw his ID card fall on the street. The soldiers chasing behind the car were getting closer.
0:15:31|0:15:35|The three shells instantly destroyed the barricade in front of the car.
0:15:35|0:15:37|[Cai Xingfu] drove the car out of the blockade at high speed.
0:15:45|0:15:58|On the other side, [Wan San] dialed [Qian Zhuoqun]'s phone number.
0:15:58|0:16:8|The scene shifts, a small car stops outside the Victoria Nightclub, a black man gets out of the car and walks into the nightclub, looking for [Qian Zhuoqun].
0:16:8|0:16:14|Qian Zhuoqun is leaning against the sofa, watching the dancer [Mei Yan] singing passionately on the stage with great interest.
0:16:47|0:16:53|The man in black flipped through a small leather bag from his briefcase and handed it to [Qian Zhuoqun].
0:17:15|0:17:16|Qin Zhuoxun poured a glass of wine for the man in black.
0:17:42|0:17:51|Later, [Qian Zhuoqun] arrived at the backstage of the nightclub, where [Mei Yan] was sitting in front of the dressing table. [Qian Zhuoqun] took out a necklace from his briefcase and put it on her.
0:18:25|0:18:34|Mei Yan was not pleased. She touched her necklace and saw Qian Zhuoqun sitting on the sofa behind her in the mirror, reading a newspaper.
0:18:34|0:18:44|[Mei Yan] pondered for a moment, slowly got up, leaned against the table, quietly pulled open the drawer of the cabinet with both hands, and took out a gun from inside.
0:18:49|0:19:1|She raised the gun with both hands, aiming at the back of [Qian Zhuoqun]'s head, quietly approaching. However, when she pulled the trigger, she found that there were no bullets in the gun. It turned out that [Qian Zhuoqun] had already noticed.
0:19:45|0:19:55|Mei Yan angrily smashed the phonograph on the ground.
0:19:55|0:20:6|Qian Zhuoqun slapped [Mei Yan] in the face.
0:20:6|0:20:11|Mei Yan unwillingly grabbed the scissors on the table and was about to stab Qian Zhuoqun, but Mei Yan was instantly subdued.
0:20:13|0:20:19|A soldier comes in and speaks to Qian Zhuoqun.
0:20:19|0:20:21|Qian Zhuoqun finished listening and continued to speak to [Mei Yan].
0:20:26|0:20:30|Qian Zhuoqun turned around and left, asking someone to fix the camera.
0:20:30|0:20:36|Later, Qian Zhuoqun rushed to the scene on Nanma Road where he found Yao Zhe's ID card on the ground.
0:20:36|0:20:42|The platoon leader of the military police mortar platoon, Li Bing, is inspecting the scene.
0:21:16|0:21:21|At the same time, [Yao Zhe] and his daughter were gagged and tied up in the attic of a clock tower.
0:21:21|0:21:24|This is a artillery position of the PLA Artillery Reconnaissance Company.
0:21:24|0:21:29|[Ma Baoshu] ran up to the attic and brought some water to feed to Yao Zhe's daughter, Xiao Lan.
0:21:29|0:21:31|[Cai Xingfu] removed the towel covering [Yao Zhe]'s mouth.
0:22:34|0:22:42|[Ma Baoshu] dragged [Cai Xingfu] to the attic platform, where Xiao Ge and Er Mao were adjusting the artillery equipment.
0:23:5|0:23:7|Cai Xingfu looked over curiously.
0:23:11|0:23:17|A shell exploded towards the platform in an instant, and Er Mao was blown out and happened to hang on the utility pole next to the building.
0:23:17|0:23:23|[Li Bing] is on a tall building in the distance, contentedly using binoculars to watch [Cai Xingfu], who is attempting to use a gun to pull Ermao back into the building.
0:23:23|0:23:26|But Ermao can't reach the gun, and the military police are on their way here.
0:23:44|0:23:50|The police rushed to the scene upon hearing the noise, and [Cai Xingfu] and the other two quickly ran back to the attic.
0:23:50|0:23:52|The military police have arrived inside the building.
0:24:7|0:24:26|[Ma Baoshu] dragged [Yao Zhe], with Xiao Ge bringing up the rear, the three of them crossed from the rooftop platform to the other side of the building, where there was a tram station below.
0:24:29|0:24:35|[Cai Xingfu] placed the child on the flat ground and went with [Ma Baoshu] to search around the tram for favorable escape points.
0:24:35|0:24:43|At this moment, a chubby guy popped his head out from the manhole next to [Yao Zhe].
0:24:43|0:24:47|[Ma Baoshu] rushed over to lift the manhole cover and quickly followed the chubby boy down into the sewer.
0:24:47|0:24:53|[Yao Zhe], Xiao Lan, and others followed down, while the pursuing constables also arrived at this building, descending the stairs and closing in.
0:25:0|0:25:5|As the military forces were about to reach the building, [Cai Xingfu] was the last one to crawl into the manhole and close the cover.
0:25:27|0:25:33|Under the manhole cover lies a different world, where a little girl in Western clothes is playing with the birds in the cage.
0:25:33|0:25:36|Xiao Lan walked over curiously.
0:26:51|0:26:56|[Cai Xingfu] used a knife to cut the rope binding [Yao Zhe]'s hands.
0:27:3|0:27:4|Xiao Lan shook her head.
0:27:8|0:27:11|[Yao Zhe] kissed Xiao Lan on the forehead, then turned to ask Xiao Wuzi.
0:27:15|0:27:17|[Cai Xingfu] pulls [Yao Zhe] aside.
0:27:50|0:28:3|[Cai Xingfu] snatched the ring from [Yao Zhe] and handed it to Xiao Wuzi.
0:28:3|0:28:9|Yao Zhe carried his daughter while Cai Xingfu and the others followed behind, with Xiao Wuzi leading the way with a lantern.
0:28:15|0:28:17|[Cai Xingfu] hesitantly puts down the gun.
0:28:27|0:28:31|Taking advantage of the chaos, [Cai Xingfu] walked ahead, holding Xiao Lan's arm and gesturing for [Yao Zhe] to take a step forward to talk.
0:28:49|0:28:55|Xiao Lan took out a small roll of gold from her clothes and handed it to Xiao Wuzi, exchanging it for her father's ring.
0:28:55|0:29:0|Later, Xiao Wuzi led a group of people to continue walking from the sewer towards the gendarmerie headquarters.
0:29:0|0:29:10|At this point, it was already dark outside. A manhole cover on the street was slowly lifted, and it was Cai Xingfu, who crawled out from the sewer.
0:29:10|0:29:17|Next up is Cai Xingfu, after climbing up to the ground, he also carried Xiao Lan out from behind, and pulled Yao Zhe out from the sewer.
0:29:33|0:29:35|Intentionally pointing towards the dimly lit street in the distance.
0:29:35|0:29:46|[Cai Xingfu], [Yao Zhe], and [Mei Yan] approached to take a look. With the cover of Little Wu's big teeth, [Yao Zhe] carried his daughter Xiao Lan and secretly ran back to the sewer.
0:29:46|0:29:56|As they shouted and dodged, [Cai Xingfu] and the others realized that [Yao Zhe] had already closed the manhole cover. [Cai Xingfu] and the rest had to abandon [Yao Zhe] and quickly retreat to a hidden location.
0:30:10|0:30:22|[Yao Zhe] quietly lifted the manhole cover and peeked out.
0:30:22|0:30:27|Xiao Wuzi brought [Yao Zhe] to the nightclub where [Mei Yan] was located, and [Yao Zhe] was making a phone call.
0:30:32|0:30:37|Upon hearing the voice of Qian Zhuoqun, [Yao Zhe] quickly hung up the phone.
0:31:0|0:31:3|[Cai Xingfu], [Ma Baoshu] and others also arrived at the Vigo Dori nightclub.
0:31:3|0:31:10|Upon entering the nightclub, I happened to see the two kids, Cai Xingfu and Yao Zhe, watching Mei Yan's dance performance.
0:31:10|0:31:20|[Cai Xingfu] stepped forward and grabbed Xiao Wuzi by the collar.
0:31:24|0:31:30|From a distance, [Yao Zhe] quickly picked up his daughter and ran to the second floor to hide from [Cai Xingfu].
0:31:30|0:31:39|Cautious [Cai Xingfu] quickly put down Xiao Wuzi and chased after, while [Yao Zhe] ran to the second floor trying to open a room to hide, either the room couldn't be opened or there was someone inside.
0:31:39|0:31:44|Suddenly, [Ma Baoshu] pointed a gun at [Yao Zhe]'s head, [Cai Xingfu] also arrived and pressed [Yao Zhe] against the wall.
0:31:45|0:31:51|At this moment, Xiao Ge and [Miss Three] who were looking outside the nightclub saw Qian Zhuoqun arriving at the nightclub with the military police.
0:32:14|0:32:18|Cai Xingfu and Yao Zhe were pressing down on each other, walking downstairs.
0:32:18|0:32:31|[Yao Zhe] saw the group at the front table entering the lobby of Mr. Ye's club, quickly pulled up his daughter, and tried to hide back.
0:32:31|0:32:33|The group at the front table saw [Cai Xingfu] heading towards the second floor.
0:32:36|0:32:45|[Cai Xingfu] calmly turned around, went downstairs, walked up to Qian Zhuoqun, while [Ma Baoshu] had already taken [Yao Zhe] and his daughter to hide on the second floor.
0:32:45|0:32:58|[Cai Xingfu] unzipped his jacket and took out his identification, handing it to Qian Zhuoqun, who opened it.
0:33:7|0:33:12|Mei Yan gave a wink to Cai Xingfu.
0:33:42|0:33:51|[Cai Xingfu] turned around, Qian Zhuoqun waved his hand, and two military police officers dragged Ermao in front of [Cai Xingfu]. [Cai Xingfu] saw that Ermao's face was covered in blood at this moment.
0:34:2|0:34:5|[Cai Xingfu] suppressed his anger and calmly looked at Ermao.
0:34:5|0:34:13|The military police pulled Ermao's hair, forcing him to lift his head and show his face to [Cai Xingfu].
0:34:48|0:34:58|Uncle Ma Baoshu looked at the dying Ermao and suddenly shouted. He pressed Yao Zhe to come down from the second floor, while Cai Xingfu quickly raised his gun at Qian Zhuoqun. A group of soldiers also aimed their guns at Cai Xingfu.
0:34:58|0:35:5|Qian Zhuoqun slowly pulled out his pistol and aimed it at [Cai Xingfu], leading to a tense standoff.
0:35:5|0:35:15|Suddenly, [Er Mao] looked up and signaled to [Cai Xingfu]. Taking advantage of the inattention of the guards on both sides, he quickly stood up, grabbed a grenade from one of the guards, pulled the pin, and detonated it on the spot.
0:35:19|0:35:26|[Ermiao] sacrificed himself. Taking advantage of the chaos, [Cai Xingfu] and [Ma Baoshu] quickly flipped over and hid as the military police opened fire.
0:35:26|0:35:32|In the chaos, [Yao Zhe] also hid, but got separated from his daughter [Xiao Lan].
0:35:38|0:35:41|[Yao Zhe] squats in a hidden spot searching around for his daughter.
0:35:41|0:35:46|[Lan] saw a woman being shot down by the military police's bullet, making her even more terrified as she crawled on the ground.
0:35:50|0:35:59|[Cai Xingfu] and [Ma Baoshu] hid behind the bar counter, fighting against the military police squad, but their firepower was no match for the squad.
0:35:59|0:36:16|Suddenly, a jeep crashed through the windows of the Ye Mansion and headed straight for the lobby. Several people on the car were holding machine guns, firing at the military police. This was when [Cao Chunsheng] led the Tianjin underground party comrades to rescue [Cai Xingfu] and the others.
0:36:16|0:36:19|[Cao Chunsheng] got off the car and handed a rifle to [Cai Xingfu].
0:36:26|0:36:36|[Ma Baoshu] quickly went to find [Yao Zhe], grabbing the back of his collar, intending to drag him away.
0:36:36|0:36:43|And [Yao Zhe] happened to see his daughter [Xiao Lan] not far away at this moment, covering her ears and screaming desperately.
0:36:46|0:36:55|[Yao Zhe] tried to break free from [Ma Baoshu], but in the midst of the gunfire from the military police closing in, he completely forgot to save his daughter.
0:36:55|0:37:5|The officials from Taiqing Mansion dragged [Yao Zhe] towards the back door to retreat, [Mei Yan] also put on her clothes, taking Little Wuzi, Big Baoya, and two younger brothers, retreating from the back door with the People's Liberation Army.
0:37:5|0:37:6|The People's Liberation Army retreated from the back door.
0:37:7|0:37:26|With the gunfire from the soldiers subsided, Qian Zhuoqun followed the sound of a girl crying. [Xiao Lan] was hiding behind a table, covering her ears. She stared in fear as Qian Zhuoqun approached, reaching out to her with a sinister smile. Meanwhile, a group of people outside the back door were still being chased by the soldiers, desperately trying to rescue their daughter.
0:37:26|0:37:27|Being dragged forward by [Ma Baoshu].
0:37:28|0:37:35|The platoon leader of the military police mortar platoon, Li Bing, is on a high building using binoculars to observe the movements and positions of the retreating group of people.
0:37:35|0:37:43|Outside the Ye Mansion, Xiao Ge and Miss San used a burning cart to block the pursuing guards, but suddenly, a shell came flying towards them from the sky.
0:37:56|0:38:16|A group of people hid at the corner of a high-rise building in the blind spot of the ceremonial guards. Xiao Wuzi pulled open a manhole cover next to him, and one by one, the group crawled into the manhole. As a shell from the guards exploded towards the group, Da Baoya was the last one to crawl in.
0:38:22|0:38:35|Ma Baoshu was speaking when suddenly he stopped in his tracks and collapsed to the ground.
0:38:35|0:38:39|Ma Baoshu's stomach was hit by a bullet, blood flowing out.
0:39:12|0:39:22|[Cai Xingfu] carried Da Bao's teeth and the group retreated in difficulty. Although the group temporarily escaped the pursuit of the gendarmerie in the end, Da Bao still died.
0:39:22|0:39:38|[Cai Xingfu] drove a truck, carrying [Mei Yan] and a group of people back to the underground party's base. [Mei Yan] held the body of Ma Baoshu, sadly picked up the birdcage next to her, took out the little bird inside, and reached out through the curtain at the back of the car.
0:39:43|0:39:56|The little bird flew from [Mei Yan]'s hand into the sky.
0:39:56|0:40:2|Back at the base, [Cai Xingfu] angrily drags [Yao Zhe] into the room.
0:41:0|0:41:4|Yao Zhe grabbed the gun held by [Cai Xingfu] and pressed it against his own forehead.
0:41:4|0:41:7|[Cai Xingfu] slowly lowered his hand holding the gun.
0:41:46|0:41:50|[Yao Zhe], who had already walked out with a gun, came back again.
0:42:35|0:42:42|In the next scene, Cao Chunsheng arrives at Wanji Candy Store, pushes the door open, and sees the female boss packing candies for a customer.
0:42:42|0:42:54|After the guests left, Cao Chunsheng casually took a box of candies and handed it to the landlady, who was actually a member of the underground Communist Party named He Xiuping, and also the wife of [Cai Xingfu].
0:42:54|0:43:1|Cao Chunsheng handed money to Xiuping, with a piece of paper sandwiched among the banknotes, which contained information for Xiuping to report to the higher-ups.
0:43:10|0:43:23|Xiuping said nothing, wrapped the candy, and quickly walked to the glass window of the candy store, where she saw her husband [Cai Xingfu] standing across the street.
0:43:23|0:43:29|At this moment, [Cai Xingfu] also saw Xiuping through the glass window, and the two gazed deeply at each other for a long time.
0:43:35|0:43:59|At night, [Xiuping] arrived at the storage room of the candy store, carefully opened the cabinet filled with candies and pastries, took out a telegraph machine from behind the cabinet, and reported to the superiors based on the information brought by [Cao Chunsheng] during the day, exposing the conspiracy of [Qian Zhuoqun] to sabotage the peace talks in Beiping.
0:43:59|0:44:0|The underground party base on the other side.
0:45:10|0:45:24|Yao Zhe gets off the car, [Cai Xingfu] signals to his comrades after getting off the car, they split up and search for ambush points in all directions, then they enter a warehouse with Yao Zhe. The warehouse is filled with piles of materials covered with cloth.
0:45:24|0:45:34|Yao Zhe lifts the covering fabric, [Cai Xingfu] knocks open the wooden box containing the weapon, and takes out a new-style machine gun.
0:45:40|0:45:50|Yao Zhe took out the packaged hand grenade, then Cai Xingfu began to carefully deploy the explosive device.
0:45:50|0:45:56|At this moment, the platoon leader of the military police mortar, Li Bing, has led his team to drive to the abandoned factory.
0:45:56|0:46:0|They got off the car, looked around, and walked towards a building.
0:46:0|0:46:3|[Ma Baoshu] led Xiao Ge and others to quickly follow up.
0:46:5|0:46:12|Several people walked while holding guns, observing the surroundings.
0:46:12|0:46:15|Several people climbed to the second floor and proceeded cautiously.
0:46:22|0:46:28|As they approached a staircase leading downwards, Xiao Ge was about to take a step when [Ma Baoshu] promptly stopped him.
0:46:28|0:46:35|There used to be a wire on this staircase, which was a hidden trap.
0:46:35|0:46:41|[Ma Baoshu] removed the mechanism with pliers, while on the other side [Cai Xingfu] was still organizing the detonator for the explosives.
0:46:50|0:46:52|Qian Zhuoqun led the team to the abandoned factory.
0:47:14|0:47:24|Qian Zhuoqun has arrived at the agreed location, and the military police quickly got off the car and deployed in formation. They watched as Cao Chunsheng and the others ran out of the warehouse and hid in a concealed location to observe the situation.
0:48:3|0:48:21|Qian Zhuoqun waved from behind, and a military police officer picked up Xiao Lan from the car and brought her to [Cai Xingfu]. Xiao Lan was tied with four hand grenades, and the grenade fuses were being pulled by the military police officer holding Xiao Lan.
0:48:21|0:48:29|Yao Zhe, hiding in the shadows, saw his daughter Xiao Lan carrying a hand grenade, and angrily picked up the explosive device.
0:49:9|0:49:13|[Ma Baoshu] looked over and saw a hand grenade hanging right below the device.
0:49:29|0:49:34|The trap is triggered, and the gendarmerie hidden below the high-rise quickly mobilize with rapid firepower.
0:49:34|0:49:47|Several plainclothes soldiers from the Liberation Army on the second floor are having a hard time defending themselves. In the fierce battle, one soldier is shot dead and falls from the second floor.
0:49:47|0:49:51|[Cai Xingfu] shot and killed the police officer who was holding a hand grenade with the fuse lit on [Xiao Lan].
0:49:52|0:50:5|The two sides quickly engaged in battle, with [Mei Yan] rushing towards [Xiao Lan], grabbing her before the others at the table could react, and carrying her away. Seeing [Mei Yan] holding the child's soul, she quickly pressed the explosive device, but the explosives did not react.
0:50:5|0:50:12|[Mei Yan] fell to the ground with a gun in her hand, and [Xiao Lan] also fell down. [Xiao Lan] got up in fright, covering her ears and running forward desperately.
0:50:23|0:50:28|The person at the front table noticed the situation and quickly fired two shots in the direction of [Xiao Lan].
0:50:28|0:50:31|Yao Zhe held the detonator and rushed out of the building while pressing it, intending to save his daughter.
0:50:47|0:50:58|In the midst of gunfire, [Xiao Lan] was hit in the arm by a bullet, but she ignored the pain, desperately running towards her father, only to fall heavily to the ground and then struggle to get back up.
0:51:4|0:51:11|Father and daughter ran desperately towards each other, and finally [Yao Zhe] picked up his daughter and they quickly hid in a safe place.
0:51:11|0:51:22|Cao Chunsheng ran from a hidden spot to support [Cai Xingfu], the firepower of the police was still fierce. At this moment, [Cai Xingfu] hiding behind the cover wall found it difficult to avoid the bullets from many police officers.
0:51:30|0:51:39|[Cai Xingfu] opens the protective cover of a car, puts his daughter inside, and starts the car.
0:51:39|0:51:42|The military police are gradually closing in.
0:51:49|0:52:0|Yao Zhe looked at his daughter in the passenger seat, her face covered in ash, crying loudly because her arm was hit by a bullet. He then glanced at Cai Xingfu outside the car, hesitated, and started the truck.
0:52:0|0:52:9|[Cai Xingfu] under the car, resisting the gunfire of the gendarmes, before he could climb onto the car, the car was driven away by [Yao Zhe], so [Cai Xingfu] had to return to his original position to avoid the gendarmes' firepower.
0:52:14|0:52:20|Driving with one hand, [Cai Xingfu] uses the other hand to help his daughter remove the hand grenade from her body and takes off his own scarf to bandage her.
0:52:29|0:52:36|And at this moment, [Cai Xingfu] had run out of ammunition in the face of the enemy, making his final struggle in the corner.
0:52:36|0:52:43|He picked up the detonator that had not been activated successfully, waiting for someone to enter the battlefield.
0:52:43|0:52:47|A group of military police are approaching the place where [Cai Xingfu] is hiding with their guns raised.
0:52:54|0:53:9|When [Cai Xingfu] was trying to activate the explosive device, he saw [Yao Zhe] driving a car, holding a gun, and turning back.
0:53:15|0:53:22|[Cai Xingfu] triggered the explosive device, and in an instant, the warehouse was engulfed in flames.
0:54:1|0:54:15|At this moment, the two trucks of military police have arrived at the unsealing military stronghold located in Quanye Field.
0:54:15|0:54:19|The military police have stormed into the building, and Xiuping, who was about to go downstairs, and other underground party members quickly retreated.
0:54:25|0:54:37|On the other side, [Cai Xingfu] was driving with [Yao Zhe], Xiaolan, [Ma Baoshu], and Xiaoge. [Ma Baoshu] sitting in the back of the car was shot in the abdomen. Xiaoge saw this and quickly asked him to use the medicine box to cover the wound, and to use a bandage to wrap it up.
0:54:49|0:54:53|At that moment, Cao Chunsheng was still struggling to fight against the military police who had surrounded the stronghold.
0:55:12|0:55:25|On the other side, [Ma Baoshu] was driving a car, taking [Yao Zhe] and the woman to the small cargo ship, when someone stopped the car.
0:55:25|0:55:32|[Yao Zhe] saw the wound on [Ma Baoshu]'s abdomen, blood was flowing non-stop, but [Ma Baoshu] still drove attentively, following the comrades leading the way ahead.
0:55:38|0:55:42|Suddenly, the mechanism was triggered, and the leading comrade was killed in the explosion.
0:55:42|0:55:46|[Ma Baoshu] slammed on the brakes, he touched the wound with his hand and said.
0:56:5|0:56:29|In this way, [Ma Baoshu] with a determined look, vowed not to return, drove forward alone, clearing the way for everyone. Every time [Ma Baoshu] cleared a small section, it would trigger some bomb mechanisms. He drove forward while holding his wound, struggling, and in the end, the car was directly blown up by a bomb, and [Ma Baoshu] bravely sacrificed himself.
0:56:32|0:56:39|Yao Zhe sat on the ground, holding his daughter, watching [Ma Baoshu] walk away for a long time.
0:56:39|0:56:48|On the other side, [Cai Xingfu] had just driven to the entrance of the Quanye Market's stronghold, when a grenade launcher fired directly towards this location.
0:56:48|0:56:53|The group at the front table on the high building saw the situation and slapped the nearby soldier.
0:56:53|0:56:55|[Cai Xingfu] hurriedly rushed into the ruins of the stronghold.
0:56:59|0:57:6|The people in the ruins of the stronghold gathered together, moving the destroyed bricks and stones to rescue their comrades in the ruins.
0:57:6|0:57:13|[Mei Yan] and Miss Three were rescued, but [Cai Xingfu]'s wife Xiuping was injured in the abdomen by the explosion and was on the verge of death.
0:57:13|0:57:14|[Cai Xingfu] picks up Xiuping.
0:57:36|0:57:50|Hearing that their son was found, Xiuping used all her remaining strength to smile at her husband with relief, but ultimately died in his arms. [Cai Xingfu] was overwhelmed with grief.
0:57:50|0:57:53|And at this moment, [Yao Zhe] also arrived carrying his daughter.
0:58:19|0:58:29|[Cai Xingfu] took off his coat, held his deceased wife, and led everyone to the cargo ship.
0:58:29|0:58:29|On the ship.
0:58:36|0:58:42|Yao Zhe was still adding coal to the boiler regardless of everything, while Cai Xingfu was once in charge of operating the ship.
0:58:42|0:58:45|Holen's indicator panel is in alert status.
0:58:48|0:59:1|[Mei Yan] sat on the deck with the dead embroidered bottle in her arms, while Xiao Ge sat with the children on the other side. [Cai Xingfu], as if not hearing [Yao Zhe]'s advice, still mechanically clamped the boiler with his eyebrows.
0:59:4|0:59:12|Yao Zhe ran to the deck, took a glance at the embroidered bottle lying peacefully in Mei Yan's arms, then turned back to Cai Xingfu and said.
0:59:18|0:59:22|[Yao Zhe] pulled [Cai Xingfu] by the hand.
0:59:27|0:59:32|[Yao Zhe] helplessly let go of the hand, while [Cai Xingfu] continued to add coal desperately.
1:0:39|1:0:49|Xiao Lan suddenly ran over and pulled Cai Xingfu by the foot. Cai Xingfu looked at the tearful child in her eyes and finally stopped his actions of destroying.
1:0:49|1:0:53|Bruised and swollen, Cai Xingfu sat down paralyzed, while Xiao Lan held her father tightly.
1:0:56|1:1:14|[Cai Xingfu] staggered to the deck where his deceased wife Xiuping lay. He knelt down, lifted her face, then embraced her tightly, crying uncontrollably.
1:1:14|1:1:22|Due to the war, the family of three could no longer reunite, and Horen was still moving rapidly.
1:1:23|1:1:30|The young lady who was originally looking at [Cai Xingfu] turned around unintentionally and looked towards the Haihe River.
1:1:44|1:1:49|Xiao Wuzi took out a trumpet from his bag, and [Cai Xingfu] quickly stepped forward to snatch the trumpet.
1:2:56|1:3:5|[Yao Zhe] watched as his daughter half knelt down.
1:3:8|1:3:13|With too many people and the situation too chaotic, not even Xiao Lan was taken care of at that time.
1:3:14|1:3:23|In the chaotic river of memories, [Cai Xingfu] swims in the river pushing a piece of driftwood.
1:3:23|1:3:36|[Yao Zhe] threw a lifebuoy to Xiaolan, but she couldn't reach it. [Yao Zhe] kept throwing the lifebuoy again and again.
1:3:41|1:3:48|In the end, with the help of Jiefang, Xiaolan drifted to Yao Zhe and Yao Zhe lifted Xiaolan up from the floating wood.
1:4:13|1:4:19|The charcoal fire under the boiler was burning more and more fiercely, and the gauge pointer went off the scale.
1:4:42|1:4:49|The boiler exploded. Before everyone could react, [Cai Xingfu] jumped into the Hai River as if he had gone mad.
1:4:49|1:5:5|[Yao Zhe] saw [Cai Xingfu] struggling in the Haihe River, and as [Cai Xingfu] began to sink into the river, [Yao Zhe] quickly took off his gloves and jacket, and jumped into the river.
1:5:5|1:5:7|The coast guards found their cargo ship by the shore.
1:5:18|1:5:25|Chao Chunsheng raised the machine gun and fired at the gendarmes on the shore.
1:5:25|1:5:27|The guards quickly opened fire towards the location of the boat.
1:5:33|1:5:49|The people on the boat picked up lifebuoys one after another and jumped into the river. Amidst the gunfire from the gendarmerie on the shore, the paddle steamer suddenly exploded. In the flames, [Yao Zhe] swam towards the riverbed, the liberated trumpet sinking into the river again and again. That's how [Yao Zhe] drowned in the Hai River at that time.
1:5:54|1:6:8|At this moment, Xiuping's body gradually sank to the bottom of the river, and Cai Xingfu, who wanted to reunite with his wife and children in heaven, also sank to the bottom of the river without any struggle.
1:6:8|1:6:18|Suddenly, Yao Zhe grabbed her collar with one hand and dragged her towards the river, while Ma Baoshu's trumpet would forever sink to the bottom of the river.
1:6:25|1:6:45|[Yao Zhe] pulled [Cai Xingfu] up to the shore with difficulty, panting heavily. [Cai Xingfu] spat out some water from his mouth and gradually recovered.
1:6:45|1:6:53|He staggered towards the shore without heeding [Yao Zhe]'s support, while [Mei Yan] also struggled to climb up the other side of the river bank.
1:6:59|1:7:2|Suddenly, the gun is pointed at his head.
1:7:2|1:7:7|[Cai Xingfu] picked up some firearms and ammunition from the dead constable on the shore.
1:7:7|1:7:11|Cao Chunsheng and Xiao Ge also successfully brought the children ashore and found [Cai Xingfu].
1:7:23|1:7:31|[Cai Xingfu] was about to load the gun when Cao Chunsheng took out the bullets from his own body and handed them to [Cai Xingfu]. Then he picked up Xiao Lan and ran away with the other children.
1:7:31|1:7:37|[Cai Xingfu] watched their departing figures with determination.
1:7:37|1:7:42|[Cai Xingfu] was holding a gun and saw three military police not far away, frowning.
1:7:42|1:7:48|[Cai Xingfu] quickly raised his gun and fired, but as soon as the bullet was shot, it alerted the surrounding guards.
1:7:48|1:7:51|Multiple bullets were fired in the direction of [Cai Xingfu].
1:7:52|1:7:58|[Cai Xingfu] kept dodging, while [Yao Zhe] clumsily held a gun and followed behind [Cai Xingfu].
1:7:58|1:8:7|[Cai Xingfu] advanced while shooting forward, taking down many police officers, but eventually he was knocked unconscious by the overwhelming number of police officers rushing towards him with rifle butts.
1:8:7|1:8:16|Yao Zhe, who had been holding a gun but hesitated to shoot, saw Cai Xingfu being dragged away by a group of military police.
1:8:25|1:8:35|The People's Liberation Army soldiers under the command of the Chief Engineer have already tested the tank shells in advance, while at this moment, a group of coal flames is hanging from the roof in front of the Military Police Headquarters, with [Cai Xingfu] bound up.
1:8:54|1:8:58|The artillery fire of the People's Liberation Army attacking Tianjin has begun.
1:9:2|1:9:5|Qian Zhuoqun pressed the mechanism to load the bullet.
1:9:5|1:9:7|The fan behind [Mei Yan] is turned on.
1:9:13|1:9:14|Qian Zhuoqun took a bite of a peach.
1:9:16|1:9:19|Qian Zhuoqun throws a peach towards the fan.
1:9:19|1:9:21|The peach is instantly crushed.
1:9:26|1:9:45|[Cai Xingfu] is tied to a chair, with a wire around his neck. At the other end of the wire is a trigger device connected to a pistol, aimed directly at [Cai Xingfu]'s forehead. If he relaxes even slightly, the mechanism will drive a metal rod to pull the trigger of the gun.
1:9:45|1:9:48|And [Mei Yan], who was hanging on the roof, was also sucked into the fan and killed.
1:9:52|1:9:57|Yao Zhe had Wan San tied up and brought him to the entrance of the building where [Cai Xingfu] and [Mei Yan] were detained.
1:9:57|1:9:59|Mei Yan's hair is getting closer and closer to Gu Fengji.
1:10:21|1:10:24|The squad leader of the military police stopped Yao Zhe and Ma Baoshu.
1:10:47|1:10:50|Wan San opened his coat to reveal a body full of explosives.
1:10:50|1:10:52|The squad leader hasn't reacted yet.
1:10:52|1:10:55|The squad leader was caught off guard and immediately grabbed by Wan San.
1:10:55|1:10:59|At this moment, [Mei Yan]'s hair was almost caught in the fan.
1:10:59|1:11:1|[Cai Xingfu] is also desperately supporting.
1:11:1|1:11:5|Wan San drove the team leader to the house and quickly strangled him to death on the ground.
1:11:7|1:11:12|[Mei Yan] is on the verge of collapse, with [Cai Xingfu] and [Mei Yan] hanging by a thread.
1:11:12|1:11:17|[Yao Zhe] pushes [Wan San] into a small house, where two military police officers are preparing explosives.
1:11:17|1:11:28|[Wan San] once again opened his coat, revealing the explosives strapped to his body to the two military police officers.
1:11:28|1:11:34|[Yao Zhe] picked up the rifle of the gendarme and knocked out the two men, then tied the gendarme to the iron railing with [Ma Baoshu].
1:11:40|1:11:49|Yao Zhe quickly knocked out Ma San with the gun barrel, then ran towards the basement where Mei Yan, Cai Xingfu, and the Beiping Military Command were being held.
1:11:58|1:12:5|Yao Zhe quickly went to pull the circuit breaker, stopped the blower, and then used a knife to cut the ropes binding Cai Xingfu and Mei Yan.
1:12:5|1:12:9|Mei Yan falls from the roof, and Yao Zhe rushes up to catch her.
1:12:9|1:12:23|Later, Yao Zhe attempted to use the gun barrel to break the iron gate lock of the detained military dependents. After several unsuccessful attempts, Yao Zhe raised the gun and the lock was opened, saving the dependents.
1:12:23|1:12:27|Outside, the precision artillery fire of the People's Liberation Army pierced multiple shooting points of the military police.
1:12:36|1:12:43|Cai Xingfu led several military police to guard outside the command post, while the military police were adjusting the bomb ignition device.
1:12:43|1:12:47|Qian Zhuoqun looked ahead, waiting for the right moment.
1:13:16|1:13:21|Military dependents quickly hit the wall together, searching for a hidden door.
1:13:21|1:13:24|The artillery of the People's Liberation Army has bombed the location where Qian Zhuoqun is located.
1:13:43|1:13:46|[Yao Zhe] opens his coat, revealing that he is also carrying explosives all over his body.
1:13:46|1:13:48|[Cai Xingfu] takes a bundle and throws the explosives into the wall.
1:13:56|1:14:13|The explosives quickly blew open the wall, revealing a sealed iron door. Outside, the gunfire from the People's Liberation Army had passed. Qian Zhuoqun lay on the ground, slowly regaining consciousness, looking around to see a scene of devastation.
1:14:24|1:14:32|Suddenly, he saw the military police officer who was about to detonate the explosives at the command post lying dead not far away, so he quickly ran over.
1:14:32|1:14:42|He pushed aside the body of the soldier, propped up the explosive device, and glared fiercely at the command post.
1:14:42|1:14:45|At this moment in the command center, everyone has already passed through the secret door.
1:14:52|1:14:54|Qian Zhuoqun presses the explosive device.
1:15:0|1:15:6|Explosives in every room of the headquarters were ignited one by one, causing a chain explosion.
1:15:6|1:15:18|Although everyone in the command center has already hidden in the underground bunker, the powerful force of the bombs above continues to destroy the building, causing debris to fall down from time to time.
1:15:18|1:15:26|[Cai Xingfu] and [Yao Zhe] are leading the military dependents through a dark passageway, when suddenly a large pile of rocks blocks the path ahead.
1:15:32|1:15:36|A large pile of rocks blocked the passage for everyone to retreat.
1:15:36|1:15:41|Everyone was trapped in a narrow passage between the chaotic rocks, with no way to escape.
1:15:41|1:15:54|The soldiers, young and old, men and women, crouched on the ground, holding their heads to guard against any loose rocks falling from above.
1:15:54|1:15:58|The explosion gradually subsided.
1:16:9|1:16:14|[Yao Zhe] looked up and saw a faint light shining in from above.
1:16:14|1:16:29|[Yao Zhe] slowly stood up and walked towards [Cai Xingfu].
1:16:29|1:16:34|[Yao Zhe] is trying to climb up to the exit, slowly pushing away the rubble at the top of the exit.
1:16:38|1:16:44|And [Cao Chunsheng] rushed to the headquarters that was bombed.
1:16:44|1:16:53|[Cao Chunsheng] continued to run forward, but the explosives in the room kept being ignited, causing him to be knocked down by the shockwave of the explosives.
1:16:53|1:16:56|[Yao Zhe] pushes open a narrow exit hole.
1:17:49|1:17:52|One by one, they were pulled out from the small hole at the exit.
1:17:52|1:18:0|At this moment on Zhongzheng Bridge, the police officers who were hiding from the PLA artillery fire gradually stood up as the shelling ceased.
1:18:0|1:18:5|The People's Liberation Army is hiding behind the advancing tanks, attacking the military police defense line at the Zhongzheng Bridge.
1:18:18|1:18:40|[Yao Zhe] and [Cai Xingfu] have successfully escaped from the dangerous headquarters with the military dependents. What should this large group of people do next? The main force has reached Zhongzheng Bridge. Hang in there, let's meet at the Rosebrugh Department Store. With [Cai Xingfu] leading the way and the military dependents following behind, he raised his hand to signal everyone to stop.
1:18:40|1:19:0|[Cai Xingfu] peeked out from behind a hidden wall and saw a small team of military police approaching from a distance. He quickly ducked behind a sandbag barrier at the side of the street. The military police hurried past him, while [Yao Zhe] and [Mei Yan] whispered to each other and looked around cautiously.
1:19:11|1:19:18|Everyone had to run from their hiding spots towards the tram at the rendezvous point. [Mei Yan] and the military dependents helped each other cross the street.
1:19:26|1:19:33|The honor guard on the rooftop is looking through binoculars at Cai Xingfu leading the military dependents carefully towards the tram.
1:19:50|1:19:59|[Cai Xingfu] saw the soldiers on the tall building firing shells, so he rushed to the high building with Cao Chunsheng and Xiao Ge, and entered the platform of the high building.
1:19:59|1:20:4|[Cai Xingfu] looked around and saw four artillerymen on one side and two on the other.
1:20:4|1:20:12|He gestured to Cao Chunsheng and Xiao Ge behind him, indicating the number of military police, locked eyes with Cao Chunsheng, and the two quickly attacked the six artillerymen.
1:20:16|1:20:27|Six artillerymen were knocked down before they could react. [Cai Xingfu] took two artillery shells and artillery equipment, while Xiao Ge took a high-quality artillery rifle, and they quickly withdrew.
1:20:27|1:20:34|[Cai Xingfu] fired two shots at the attic on the platform, and the startled guards inside hurriedly ran out.
1:20:41|1:21:0|Li Bing suddenly ran crazily on the rooftop of a high-rise building. [Cai Xingfu] saw that shooting with a gun couldn't lock onto a moving target, so he switched to using a mortar. He picked up a mortar, loaded it into the device's barrel, and aimed with his thumb at Li Bing's position and distance. Li Bing ran forward in a panic, and [Cai Xingfu] estimated the distance and speed at which Li Bing was running.
1:21:0|1:21:8|Cai Xingfu calmly fired a shell and successfully hit Li Bing as he flipped over a pile of sandbag obstacles.
1:21:17|1:21:20|Later, [Cai Xingfu] took the military dependents onto the tram.
1:21:20|1:21:34|[Yao Zhe] starts the tram, while [Mei Yan], standing at the back of the carriage, watches as the tram moves along, looking at the chaotic and empty streets outside the window.
1:21:34|1:21:39|[Cai Xingfu], [Yao Zhe], and others were also standing inside the carriage, constantly observing the situation outside the carriage.
1:21:43|1:21:50|Suddenly, a car turned from another street into the street where the tram was located.
1:21:50|1:21:56|During the raid, [Cai Xingfu] quickly crouched down to hide, prompting [Yao Zhe] to lead three constables in pursuit.
1:22:0|1:22:3|[Cai Xingfu] sees the scared military dependent child next to him.
1:22:3|1:22:8|In order to protect everyone's safety, he picked up the rifle and stood up, shooting at the car following behind.
1:22:8|1:22:16|The military dependent child saw a puddle of blood left where [Cai Xingfu] had just squatted.
1:22:16|1:22:20|At this moment, there is intense fighting on the Zhongzheng Bridge.
1:22:20|1:22:25|On the defense line, a machine gun continuously fires at the advancing People's Liberation Army after hitting the tank.
1:22:28|1:22:33|With the advance of the attack, the medics quickly caught up and provided assistance to the injured soldiers.
1:22:50|1:22:58|On the other side, the machine gun of the military police is extremely powerful. [Cai Xingfu] and Xiao Ge quickly crouch down behind the carriage to avoid the dense bullets.
1:22:58|1:23:10|[Cai Xingfu] has been hit by multiple bullets in the abdomen, no longer poking his head out from the entrance in front of the tram, shooting at the group following behind the car.
1:23:10|1:23:15|The military police threw a grenade into the tram, and [Cai Xingfu] quickly rushed forward, using his body to shield the grenade.
1:23:19|1:23:21|Did not let the grenade injure the others in the car.
1:23:26|1:23:29|[Cao Chunsheng] sacrificed heroically.
1:23:29|1:23:47|Witnessing the sacrifice of his comrade once again, [Cai Xingfu] stood up with determination, grabbed the machine gun in his hand, and started shooting at [Qian Zhuoqun] who had been following them. Each bullet contained hidden anger, and all the soldiers in [Qian Zhuoqun]'s car were taken down by [Cai Xingfu], leaving only [Qian Zhuoqun] himself, who picked up a machine gun and jumped out of the car.
1:23:47|1:23:54|The car crashed into the slowly moving tram, [Yao Zhe] and [Cai Xingfu] turned around, the tram was about to collide with the debris ahead.
1:24:1|1:24:18|Under the violent impact, the entire tram overturned. Meanwhile, on the Zhongzheng Bridge, the People's Liberation Army advanced like a raging tide. Two PLA tanks formed a strong offensive defense, continuously pushing forward. The PLA was about to capture the Zhongzheng Bridge and advance into the city.
1:24:35|1:24:49|On this side, [Cai Xingfu] is helping the military dependents climb out of the tram. He first takes the children out of the tram, then goes to rescue the women and elderly trapped inside.
1:24:49|1:24:56|[Cai Xingfu] rushed to the back of the car, where [Mei Yan] and some military dependents were trapped in the carriage.
1:24:56|1:24:58|[Cai Xingfu] breaks the train window with a gun.
1:25:12|1:25:17|Xiao Ge went to find the observation point, and [Qian Zhuoqun], who had jumped off the car earlier, also gradually regained consciousness.
1:25:17|1:25:26|He got up from the ground and saw [Cai Xingfu] leading all the military dependents into the building of Zhongyuan Department Store.
1:25:40|1:25:55|The People's Liberation Army has successfully captured the Zhongzheng Bridge. The main force continues to advance towards the city, but the firepower of the military police on the high-rise buildings in the city cannot be underestimated.
1:25:55|1:25:57|At this moment, inside Zhongyuan Department Store.
1:25:59|1:26:9|The crowd turned around and saw an armored tank approaching Zhongyuan Department Store, with the fierce [Qian Zhuoqun] standing on top of the tank.
1:26:9|1:26:17|He confidently smiled at everyone and grabbed the machine gun on the tank.
1:26:17|1:26:22|After [Qian Zhuoqun] squeezed the bullet, the glass door of Zhongyuan Department Store shattered and fell.
1:26:31|1:26:45|The explosion of a tank shell instantly blew open the door of Zhongyuan Department Store. The guy at the observation point above the high-rise saw Cai Xingfu quickly fire a shell in his direction. Cai Xingfu cleverly hid inside the tank, inside the department store.
1:27:1|1:27:5|[Mei Yan] takes off her coat and picks up the little girl in the arms of an old lady.
1:27:5|1:27:10|The tank from the front table suddenly moved its cannon and aimed directly at the high-rise building.
1:27:10|1:27:15|The young man on the high building was killed by the explosion before he could hide.
1:27:15|1:27:22|Witnessing the sacrifice of another comrade, [Cai Xingfu] angrily fires at the tank, which suddenly rushes towards the department store.
1:27:36|1:27:47|Tank broke through the building, provocatively shooting at the military dependents hiding on the second floor, and another shell blasted towards the second floor.
1:27:52|1:28:8|[Cai Xingfu] and [Yao Zhe] ran towards the other side. They saw the tank preparing to fire shells at the military dependents on the second floor. [Cai Xingfu] quickly fired a few shots at the tank, attracting the guards inside the tank and changing the direction of the attack. The tank indeed adjusted its direction and headed straight towards [Cai Xingfu] and [Yao Zhe].
1:28:12|1:28:31|The two hurriedly ran towards the hidden corner of the shelves, [Qian Zhuoqun] slightly peeked out from the tank to observe the direction of the attack. Suddenly, the two hiding behind the shelves noticed that the tank's cannon slowly appeared above them. They quickly continued to evade forward as the tank pressed against the shelves, and the bullets fired by the tank also hit one of their arms.
1:28:31|1:28:34|Cai Xingfu and Yao Zhe finally made it to the bar.
1:28:40|1:28:47|[Cai Xingfu] grabbed a bottle of liquor from the bar, looked at [Yao Zhe], then got up, flipped over the bar, and ran to the other side, attracting the attention of [Qian Zhuoqun] inside the tank.
1:28:47|1:29:1|Here, [Yao Zhe] quickly and intuitively grabs several bottles of strong liquor from the bar counter, looking towards the rack displaying cheongsams on the side.
1:29:1|1:29:5|[Yao Zhe] went to tear the fabric of the cheongsam and stuffed it into the mouth of the wine bottle.
1:29:9|1:29:13|Cai Xingfu, who is responsible for luring Qian Zhuoqun, can't hold on any longer.
1:29:13|1:29:23|[Cai Xingfu] sat on the ground, pressed the grenade in his hand, flashed and threw the grenade under the tank driven by [Qian Zhuqun].
1:29:23|1:29:27|The tank was stopped by an explosion, but its cannon was aimed at [Cai Xingfu] who had just stood up.
1:29:32|1:29:45|At this moment, [Yao Zhe] rushed over with a burning bottle of alcohol and quickly threw it into the tank's window, prompting [Qian Zhuoqun] inside the tank to crawl out.
1:29:45|1:29:51|Qian Zhuoqun had just poked his head out of the tank when [Cai Xingfu] raised his gun and shot. Qian Zhuoqun was hit and fell back into the tank.
1:29:59|1:30:12|The military police on the high building continued to fire fiercely, injuring the advancing People's Liberation Army soldiers with machine gun bullets. Two tanks of the PLA continued to move in parallel to provide cover, aiming their tank barrels at the shooting points of the military police on the high building.
1:30:24|1:30:29|Under a barrage of shells, the last defense point of the Xianbing was finally destroyed.
1:30:29|1:30:40|The People's Liberation Army advanced smoothly into the city, a soldier waving a red flag ran into the ranks and planted the flag on one side of the Zhongzheng Bridge, finally capturing Tianjin City.
1:30:47|1:30:56|And at this moment, [Cai Xingfu] and [Yao Zhe] were walking slowly towards the second floor of the department store, expecting to celebrate their victory with the Jun family.
1:30:56|1:31:3|A little girl suddenly pointed behind [Yao Zhe], and Qian Zhuoqun was still alive.
1:31:3|1:31:14|He was aiming his gun at the members of the Jun family on the second floor, with [Yao Zhe] bravely using his body to shield them, the bullet piercing [Yao Zhe]'s heart.
1:31:37|1:31:44|[Mei Yan] shoots at Qian Zhuoqun with a gun, Qian Zhuoqun looks at [Mei Yan] in surprise, [Mei Yan] walks down from the second floor holding the gun.
1:31:54|1:32:4|[Mei Yan] decisively hit Qian Zhuoqun's abdomen and legs, causing him to kneel down on the ground.
1:32:4|1:32:9|Mei Yan decisively fired another shot, hitting Qian Zhuoqun right in the forehead.
1:32:9|1:32:12|[Mei Yan] finally killed Qian Zhuoqun with her own hands.
1:32:19|1:32:30|The People's Liberation Army troops also arrived at Zhongyuan Department Store at this moment, and everyone was finally rescued.
1:32:30|1:32:34|[Yao Zhe], who was hit by Qian Zhuoqun, is now barely clinging to life.
1:33:28|1:33:33|[Yao Zhe] apologized to [Cai Xingfu] with all his remaining strength.
1:33:50|1:34:4|Gradually, [Yao Zhe]'s eyes became unfocused, his breathing calmed down, he stopped speaking, and slowly died.
1:34:4|1:34:8|[Cai Xingfu] cried and pounded the wall beside him with his head.
1:34:17|1:34:22|After the transition, [Cai Xingfu] pushed open the doors of the church and walked in.
1:34:53|1:34:57|[Cai Xingfu] carried Xiao Lan out of the church, with Miss Three following behind.
1:34:57|1:35:7|Three people walked out of the church. Xiao Lan looked into the distance with confusion, not knowing that her father had already gone to heaven.
1:35:7|1:35:14|But [Yao Zhe] sacrificed heroically, saving the lives of dozens of innocent people, a heroic deed that will be forever remembered by people.
1:35:19|1:35:31|The movie scene takes us back to the establishment of New China, with soldiers and civilians driving cars adorned with banners proclaiming "Long live the Chinese people" and featuring the image of the great leader Chairman Mao.
1:35:31|1:35:37|[Cai Xingfu] walked through the crowd holding Xiao Lan, who was also waving a small red flag.
1:35:37|1:35:41|They continued to walk forward with Mei Yan's youngest son and third daughter waiting for them on the roadside.
1:35:44|1:35:49|[Mei Yan], also dressed in military uniform, is now also a member of the People's Liberation Army.
1:35:49|1:35:58|They ran towards Tiananmen Square and saw the People's Liberation Army marching in neat formation amidst the cheers of the crowd.
1:35:58|1:36:2|[Cai Xingfu] seemed to see a young PLA soldier holding a bugle in the crowd.
1:36:24|1:36:39|Under the Tiananmen Gate Tower, there was a frenzy, with [Cai Xingfu] excitedly howling.
1:36:39|1:36:41|Upon hearing this, [Mei Yan] also joyfully howled.
1:36:51|1:37:2|The frozen frame captured this photo of the five celebrating the establishment of New China, behind this black and white photo is full of history and memories.
