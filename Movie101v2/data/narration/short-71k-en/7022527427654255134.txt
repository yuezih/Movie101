0:1:57|0:2:12|After the phone call ended, [Yang Fangfang] seemed to have lost her soul. She slowly lowered her phone, closed her eyes, and stared blankly ahead. Hearing this familiar voice again, her heart started to ache once more. What did this long-awaited phone call represent?
0:2:31|0:2:40|Outside the window is a brightly lit street, with cars roaring past in the background. At this moment, [Yang Fangfang] looks at her reflection in the mirror, already immersed in that green memory.
0:2:40|0:2:49|High school student [Yang Fangfang] in school uniform is reaching out to grab a branch outside the school building, she tries hard to wave her hand, but still can't reach it.
0:2:58|0:3:6|She put away the letter and walked straight to the classroom.
0:3:35|0:3:42|Yang Fangfang, who immediately put away the letter, caught the attention of her desk mate, Guo Yang.
0:4:58|0:5:15|In her memory, she slowly walked down the stairs, feeling like a deer in headlights. When she reached the corner of the stairs, she stopped and peeked out. At that moment, [Guo Yang] was still standing at the intersection. She then tidied up the stray hair by her ear and walked out with her head down.
0:5:19|0:5:26|The two male classmates standing with [Guo Yang] immediately nudged him over when they saw [Yang Fangfang] coming out.
0:5:31|0:5:44|She walked straight ahead, listening to the faint footsteps behind her, feeling nervous. Her legs quickened their pace, and after a few more steps, she heard no more sound behind her.
0:5:44|0:5:56|[Yang Fangfang] glanced back slightly, then turned around. [Guo Yang], who had been following behind her, had disappeared by now. She stood in place for a long time, feeling a sense of loss in her heart.
0:5:57|0:6:18|At this moment, [Yang Fangfang], who had just come to her senses from her memories, looked downstairs and suddenly saw her classmate Wu Xiaoyu being surrounded by a group of female students. They were pushing Wu Xiaoyu towards the direction of the woods. [Yang Fangfang] anxiously leaned out to check, then hurriedly ran out. Halfway there, she suddenly realized that she couldn't do much on her own, so she ran back to the classroom to find help.
0:6:27|0:6:38|Hearing the news of Wu Xiaoyu's accident, Li Lin quickly ran down the stairs with [Yang Fangfang], while on the other side, the female thug was questioning.
0:7:24|0:7:38|At noon, all the students were doing radio exercises on the playground. After the activity ended, the sound of the school's loudspeaker could be heard.
0:7:58|0:8:10|In high school, student relationships always give the school a headache, but at this moment, [Yang Fangfang] even feels a bit envious. When she gets home at night, she takes out the letter written by [Guo Yang] and savors it again.
0:8:16|0:8:33|After instructing [Yang Fangfang], mom turned around and gently closed the door, walked to the living room, pointed to [Yang Fangfang]'s room, glanced at dad, and the loud laughter in the living room immediately stopped.
0:8:34|0:8:40|The next day, [Yang Fangfang] was accompanying Wu Xiaoyu to the restroom when the male classmate who had delivered the letter stopped her.
0:8:50|0:9:18|She snatched the envelope back from her male classmate, immediately opened it and smiled broadly. Reluctantly taking back the letter, [Yang Fangfang] walked towards the women's restroom while reading. During physical education class, the two of them rested in a shady spot by the wall. The smile on [Yang Fangfang]'s face was now replaced with worry, so she had to turn to Wu Xiaoyu beside her for help.
0:9:56|0:10:8|The only group photo came from a chance encounter during the National Day performance. The familiar profile in the photo triggered memories for [Yang Fangfang], while on stage, [Guo Yang] was wearing a white shirt, showcasing his talent to the fullest.
0:10:8|0:10:17|The perfect performance drew continuous applause from the audience. At this moment, [Yang Fangfang] lying on the bed, tightly hugged her own photo album.
0:10:17|0:10:21|Lost in the memories of her secret crush, [Yang Fangfang] had a dreamy smile on her face.
0:10:21|0:10:30|During the break the next day, the inseparable sisters were eating snacks together when Wu Xiaoyu approached [Yang Fangfang] and said,
0:11:20|0:11:28|On the way home in the car, Wu Xiaoyu's secret kept lingering in the ears, while [Yang Fangfang] secretly made up her mind.
0:11:57|0:12:21|Mom handed over a piece of paper while crying, [Yang Fangfang] took it and read the content, which was unbelievable. She turned around and asked, the mom in front of her was already in tears, and [Yang Fangfang] knew the answer in her heart. The sudden departure of her brother had dealt a huge blow to this family.
0:12:21|0:12:29|Mom lay on the bed all day, tears streaming down her face. Dad sat by the bed with untouched food in hand. [Yang Fangfang] stood by, at a loss.
0:12:38|0:12:52|At this moment, [Yang Fangfang] was too preoccupied to answer Wu Xiaoyu's question, anxiously looking around outside the taxi for her brother's figure. As time passed day by day, [Yang Fangfang] temporarily forgot about these troubling matters and a long-lost smile appeared on her face while playing with friends.
0:12:52|0:13:21|On this day after school, [Yang Fangfang] walked home with an umbrella as usual. The rain was getting heavier, but her pace remained unchanged. Slowly passing by a pavilion on the roadside, she glanced inside and unexpectedly saw a familiar figure. At that moment, her brother, who was curled up in a chair, slowly opened his eyes. [Yang Fangfang] forcefully tugged at her brother's clothes, and he sat up grumpily.
0:13:21|0:13:28|Anxiously looking up at [Yang Fangfang], but seeing her tearful eyes made him feel ashamed.
0:13:28|0:13:36|The search in these days finally yielded good results, and the stone that had been weighing on [Yang Fangfang]'s heart finally fell to the ground.
0:13:36|0:13:44|After the brother returned safely, life at home finally returned to normal, and [Yang Fangfang]'s thoughts also changed.
0:14:21|0:14:25|The form of the girl's secret crush is temporarily put on hold, only to become a better self.
0:14:53|0:15:1|During self-study class, bored Wu Xiaoyu poked [Yang Fangfang] who was sitting in front of her with a pen, but [Yang Fangfang] just focused on studying and ignored her.
0:15:1|0:15:16|The sudden power outage broke the silence, cheers and excitement filled the air, but then the power came back on, followed by sighs and complaints.
0:15:46|0:15:54|[Yang Fangfang] insisted on having the myopia surgery, and no one could stop her. This fearless courage might be the strength given to succeed in becoming beautiful.
0:16:14|0:16:20|After the college entrance examination, [Yang Fangfang] finally arrived at the hospital for surgery.
0:16:43|0:16:53|[Yang Fangfang] sat on the operating table, silently encouraging herself. Then she immediately lay down, smiling as she stared at the machine above. The transformation surgery of the ugly duckling is about to begin. Step two, turn white.
0:17:2|0:17:9|[Yang Fangfang] chooses to believe in the efficacy of the facial mask for now, closing her eyes and quietly enjoying it.
0:18:23|0:18:34|[Yang Fangfang] sighed softly, lowered her head in contemplation, obviously her brother lacked courage in this aspect. Now, isn't she also missing this final step?
0:18:34|0:18:46|The girl on the platform looked at her brother by the window from a distance, but the train had already started moving slowly.
0:18:57|0:19:15|The platform gradually disappeared from view, leaving only a sense of helplessness in the heart. No matter how reluctant the older brother was at the time, if he hadn't gotten off the train, there would have been no outcome. Time does not turn back, the train does not stop. Hesitating repeatedly about what to do will make it difficult to maintain the initial enthusiasm, and not making an effort to see the person you want will ultimately result in missed opportunities.
0:19:15|0:19:48|[Yang Fangfang] may have known the answer in her heart. At this moment, [Yang Fangfang] is sitting on the bus back to the town, leaning her head against the window, looking at the green mountains and clear waters outside. A faint smile hangs on her lips as the village gradually comes into view. [Yang Fangfang] sits up straight and looks around, then she smiles and waves outside. The bus slowly stops by the roadside, and [Yang Fangfang]'s face is full of smiles. She has already picked up the backpack on her lap, ready to get off.
0:19:53|0:20:10|After exchanging greetings, [Yang Fangfang] and her friend walked towards the village carrying things. Passing by her childhood home, [Yang Fangfang] stopped and looked from a distance. Then she walked up the steps, looked through the window into the house for a long time, and turned to her friend beside her, saying,
0:20:12|0:20:19|The friend replied perfunctorily, looking at the still reluctant Yang Fangfang, she quickly ran down the steps.
0:20:50|0:20:56|At night, while her friends were already fast asleep, [Yang Fangfang] was writing in her diary.
0:21:31|0:21:39|The boy who made faces at her from the back seat of the bicycle in her memory is none other than [Guo Yang]. Only he knows the secret of leaving after just one o'clock.
0:21:40|0:21:47|At this point, [Yang Fangfang] stopped writing and leaned on the table.
0:21:51|0:22:22|She looked at the diary in front of her, immersed in beautiful anticipation. [Yang Fangfang] stood on the dock, gazing at the calm lake in front of her. Whenever someone passed by, she would turn around to confirm if it was [Guo Yang]. Wearing a white dress, she looked around on the shore, hoping to see that long-awaited face at some moment.
0:22:29|0:22:40|Her eyes never left every corner of the shore, a few lights were visible in the windows of the houses by the lake, she had looked very carefully, but she couldn't see the figure of [Guo Yang].
0:24:49|0:25:6|The questioning from her friend made [Yang Fangfang] flustered. She mumbled a few words, but her friend didn't pay much attention. That night, the two of them arrived at the snack street.
0:25:16|0:25:32|Upon hearing someone calling for a friend, [Yang Fangfang] turned her head and found the person standing opposite to be the long-awaited encounter. Following her friend, [Yang Fangfang] walked while using her hand to wipe away the residue on her face.
0:25:47|0:25:54|[Yang Fangfang] didn't know how to respond, she exchanged glances with her friend.
0:26:51|0:27:10|Inexperienced Yang Fangfang scratched her head in confusion, and in order not to dampen the mood, she bravely raised her glass and drank it down.
0:27:47|0:27:51|After a night of drinking and chatting, the next morning everyone got into a car together for a day trip.
0:28:11|0:28:25|The water rafting made everyone cheer and scream, [Yang Fangfang] sat in the boat tightly holding the handle, while [Guo Yang] was sitting opposite paddling gracefully.
0:28:30|0:28:36|During the conversation, their small boat accidentally hit the shore. With [Guo Yang] around, [Yang Fangfang] didn't feel scared.
0:28:59|0:29:21|As they reached the narrow passage, the water suddenly became turbulent. The small boats of the group rushed down with the current, creating waves and screams that filled the entire valley. The boat at the back was also approaching a steep slope. [Guo Yang] smiled and said to [Yang Fangfang],
0:29:23|0:29:53|Accompanied by the screams of the two, the small boat plummeted down with the rapids. [Yang Fangfang] was already so scared that she didn't care about her image, her fearful screams echoing through the valley. Just when they reached a calm spot, the small boat started to lose control. A sudden accident occurred as the boat got stuck in a whirlpool, causing it to capsize. [Yang Fangfang] drifted away in the direction of the water flow.
0:29:53|0:29:55|Guo Yang hurriedly swam over and lifted her up.
0:29:55|0:30:17|At this moment, in a panic, [Yang Fangfang] clung to [Guo Yang] like clutching at a life-saving straw, tightly holding onto his neck and leaning her body upwards. [Guo Yang] held her around the waist and swam towards the shore. In her most desperate moment, [Guo Yang]'s strong protection brought [Yang Fangfang] a sense of security. Her inner vulnerability and grievances couldn't help but burst forth at this moment.
0:30:17|0:30:32|By the time they reached the shore, [Guo Yang] was already exhausted. He staggered as he carried [Yang Fangfang] ashore, but the hands around his neck refused to let go.
0:31:3|0:31:12|After the emotions calmed down, [Guo Yang] carefully reminded and supported the petite [Yang Fangfang] to the bridge. The smiles returned to their faces.
0:31:22|0:31:31|But as long as she could follow him, [Yang Fangfang] felt at ease. She was shy and didn't dare to look up on the way, while [Guo Yang] broke the silence first.
0:32:31|0:32:37|The rhythmic guitar sound starts playing, [Yang Fangfang] smiles as she looks at [Guo Yang] on the stage.
0:33:0|0:33:6|On the stage, [Guo Yang] shone brightly under the spotlight, while [Yang Fangfang] sat below, mesmerized by the profile of [Guo Yang].
0:33:54|0:34:0|Yang Fangfang in the audience had a smile on her face, perhaps she had already found that extraordinary lover.
0:34:13|0:34:45|[Guo Yang] held a glass of wine in one hand, snatched [Yang Fangfang]'s glass with the other hand, then tilted his head back and poured all the wine into his mouth. His friends around him teased him, and after the party, [Guo Yang] and [Yang Fangfang] took a walk together. As the alcohol started to take effect, [Guo Yang]'s body began to sway from side to side. [Yang Fangfang] sneakily glanced at him and couldn't help but burst into laughter. At this moment, [Guo Yang] looked dazed, and his walking became unsteady.
0:34:48|0:35:11|[Guo Yang] sat down on the steps, supporting himself with his hands behind him. He then looked up at [Yang Fangfang], gesturing for her to sit next to him. After [Yang Fangfang] sat down, she tightly held onto her skirt, keeping her head down and avoiding eye contact with [Guo Yang]. [Guo Yang], on the other hand, kept staring at [Yang Fangfang]. Perhaps sensing the intensity of his gaze, [Yang Fangfang] lifted her head only to catch his eyes that he couldn't dodge in time.
0:35:12|0:35:28|Guo Yang turned his head and saw Yang Fangfang smiling at him. She blushed and buried her face shyly. Guo Yang's eyes were fixed on Yang Fangfang, his hands on his lap fidgeting back and forth. He moved his lips as if wanting to speak, but felt like something was blocking his throat.
0:35:28|0:35:36|The night was so quiet that one could hear their own nervous breathing. Finally, he mustered up the courage to say to [Yang Fangfang],
0:35:41|0:35:54|Upon hearing these words, [Yang Fangfang] became even more shy, her smile on her face unable to hide. Without a clear rejection from [Yang Fangfang], [Guo Yang] felt relieved. He let out a long sigh and then placed his hands back behind him.
0:35:54|0:36:1|Yang Fangfang moved closer to him, and at this moment, she kept her head down without moving. Guo Yang took the initiative to lower his head and said,
0:36:12|0:36:32|[Yang Fangfang] smiled and replied, [Guo Yang] couldn't resist anymore as he looked at the innocent [Yang Fangfang] in front of him. He hugged [Yang Fangfang] and kissed her suddenly. The unexpected kiss was like a storm, leaving [Yang Fangfang] wide-eyed and blank-minded. She looked at the face so close to hers, smelled his faint fragrance, and felt his breath.
0:36:32|0:36:42|[Yang Fangfang] felt like her beautiful dream had come true, not sure if it was her own nervousness or [Guo Yang]'s kiss was too intense, she felt like she couldn't breathe.
0:36:42|0:37:2|Sensing something unusual from [Yang Fangfang], [Guo Yang] stopped and asked. [Yang Fangfang] blushed and stared at the person in front of her, but when she saw his flustered expression, she smiled again, her eyes narrowing into slits. Then she shyly lowered her head. [Guo Yang] looked at her happily and also started to smile.
0:37:2|0:37:11|In the early morning, Zhenyuan seemed to be covered in a layer of fine sand. The two held hands and came to the lakeside.
0:37:37|0:37:43|The emerald green lake, a small boat stops, [Guo Yang] raises his hand on one side, signaling [Yang Fangfang] to grab him.
0:38:10|0:38:23|[Yang Fangfang] sat on the boat, hands holding on to the sides, while [Guo Yang] skillfully rowed at the bow, creating a pleasant world for the two of them, making [Yang Fangfang] feel content both physically and mentally.
0:38:31|0:38:43|In the early morning, the two of them held hands and came to the top of the mountain to overlook the scenery of Zhenyuan. The gentle sunlight shone on [Guo Yang]'s face, and [Yang Fangfang] looked up at his sharply defined profile. She couldn't help but tiptoe and gently kissed his cheek.
0:39:11|0:39:18|She wished so much that time could stop, holding hands with [Guo Yang] becoming tighter and tighter.
0:40:4|0:40:9|[Yang Fangfang] reproachfully said a sentence to Wu Xiaoyu, then uncomfortably scratched her face with her hand.
0:40:59|0:41:2|Wu Xiaoyu finished speaking with a meaningful look at the two people opposite.
0:41:2|0:41:8|[Yang Fangfang] rested her chin on her hand, pretending not to understand. After the dinner, the two of them went out to the street and started playing the game of whack-a-mole.
0:41:11|0:41:25|The sky darkens, with a few lights flickering on the square. [Guo Yang] carries [Yang Fangfang] on his back, running and cheering on the square. Passersby look on curiously as the joyful time flies by. [Yang Fangfang] walks to the bus stop sign, while [Guo Yang] slowly follows behind with something in his hands.
0:41:38|0:41:46|[Yang Fangfang] finished speaking and shyly lowered her head. Seeing this, [Guo Yang] didn't say anything more. The two of them then stood in place and started playing the game of "You Draw, I Guess".
0:42:7|0:42:15|[Yang Fangfang] lowered her head in thought for a moment after hearing this, then turned around and smiled at [Guo Yang], saying,
0:43:9|0:43:30|[Guo Yang] didn't answer, holding [Yang Fangfang] with one hand and picking up the luggage on the side with the other. The dim light in the hotel corridor revealed a hint of ambiguity. [Guo Yang] led [Yang Fangfang] towards the room, when suddenly a couple approached them. [Yang Fangfang] awkwardly turned her head away.
0:43:30|0:43:37|Strange sounds could be heard from the corridor from time to time, gradually causing disgust in [Yang Fangfang]. Looking at the unfamiliar surroundings, her face turned very unpleasant.
0:43:37|0:44:5|At this moment, [Guo Yang] was looking up intently searching for the room, while [Yang Fangfang] was walking faster in the opposite direction. [Guo Yang] quickly caught up and they walked side by side without saying a word. Suddenly, [Guo Yang] stopped, turned around, and looked at [Yang Fangfang], whispering,
0:44:9|0:44:15|Looking at the sincere gaze of [Guo Yang], her heart began to waver, and the idea of leaving ruthlessly drifted away one by one.
0:44:15|0:44:30|The two then entered the room, the sound of running water coming from the bathroom. [Guo Yang] sat on the bed watching TV, irritably pressing the remote control in his hand. His eyes involuntarily glanced towards the bathroom, then he turned his head, trying hard to control his actions.
0:44:30|0:44:37|The bathroom door suddenly opened, startling [Guo Yang]. After a quick glance, he immediately turned his head towards the television.
0:44:37|0:44:48|[Yang Fangfang] said to him. [Guo Yang] pretended to be calm and responded with a sound, walking towards the bathroom.
0:44:48|0:44:59|Yang Fangfang on the side looked at his embarrassed expression, chuckled quietly, suddenly the footsteps behind stopped, Yang Fangfang turned around and found Guo Yang carefully holding his change of clothes.
0:44:59|0:45:19|To avoid embarrassment, [Yang Fangfang] quickly averted her gaze, while [Guo Yang] swiftly grabbed his clothes and headed towards the bathroom. That night, they each slept on a separate bed, but [Guo Yang] couldn't calm his inner turmoil. He kept staring at [Yang Fangfang]'s back, wanting to say something, but after a while, he lay back down. After much internal struggle, he finally raised his head and asked,
0:45:24|0:45:50|[Yang Fangfang] was not actually asleep. She responded softly, and then [Guo Yang] lifted the covers and sat up from the bed. Suddenly, [Yang Fangfang] felt someone gently pulling the corner of her back, she immediately closed her eyes and felt the warm breath behind her neck. Every nerve in [Yang Fangfang]'s body seemed to be electrified as the two bodies pressed closer on the narrow single bed. [Guo Yang] could not hide the heat in his heart, and gently kissed [Yang Fangfang]'s neck.
0:45:50|0:46:7|The following kiss became more intense, with [Yang Fangfang] tightly furrowing her brows without moving. Then, [Guo Yang] propped up his upper body with one arm, and each kiss fell on [Yang Fangfang]'s shoulders and arms. [Guo Yang]'s breathing also became increasingly heavy.
0:46:13|0:46:28|When emotions ran deep, [Guo Yang]'s hands moved uncontrollably, causing [Yang Fangfang] to sit up in fear. She lowered her head, unable to face him, and involuntarily shifted her body away. With a hint of apology, [Guo Yang] spoke.
0:46:28|0:46:41|The two of them lay on the bed again, but this time with some distance between them. [Yang Fangfang] looked at the guilty [Guo Yang] and didn't say anything more. After a while, she slowly closed her eyes. Although [Guo Yang] promised not to make any moves, his inner desire did not diminish at all.
0:46:45|0:46:58|He couldn't help but lean over and gently kiss Yang Fangfang's forehead, then retreated to a safe distance. Guo Yang quietly looked at the petite and lovely face in front of him, feeling helpless and frustrated by this unattainable sensation.
0:46:58|0:47:7|At this moment, the faint scent on [Yang Fangfang]'s body occasionally lingered in his nostrils, as if the desire that had just subsided in his body was reignited.
0:47:7|0:47:29|After a while, [Guo Yang] could no longer bear the restlessness in his body. He pushed aside the blanket and dove into his own quilt as if escaping, turning his back and not daring to look at [Yang Fangfang]. His other hand tightly gripped the corner of the blanket. For anyone involved, this was destined to be a difficult night.
0:47:29|0:47:52|The next morning, [Yang Fangfang] groggily opened her eyes. With a hint of morning grumpiness, she let out a soft hum and then turned her head to see if [Guo Yang] had woken up. However, the bed opposite hers was empty, and the room was quiet. She immediately got up from bed and peeked towards the bathroom, nervously calling out,
0:47:52|0:48:7|The room was empty and silent, [Yang Fangfang] suddenly felt afraid, her heart beating rapidly. She quickly got out of bed and opened the curtains. Just as she was looking for [Guo Yang] through the window, a knocking sound suddenly came from behind her.
0:48:17|0:48:47|Outside the door was the voice of [Guo Yang]. [Yang Fangfang] felt relieved and immediately ran to open the door. After closing the door, [Yang Fangfang] obediently followed behind [Guo Yang], finding it somewhat amusing to think about her previous panic. The two then sat on chairs and began to enjoy breakfast.
0:48:52|0:49:10|Upon hearing [Guo Yang]'s words, [Yang Fangfang] shyly lowered her head, stirring her breakfast with chopsticks. The two then held hands and visited the scenic spot together, with [Guo Yang] standing in front of a locked gate while [Yang Fangfang] stood beside him with her eyes closed.
0:50:5|0:50:20|[Guo Yang]'s words made [Yang Fangfang] feel cared for. She hugged [Guo Yang] and rested her head on his shoulder, saying that pretending not to miss him would be a lie.
0:51:54|0:52:15|Latecomer Yang Fangfang quickly found a seat, opened her notebook, but then her daughter and boyfriend's photo appeared on the foreign language teacher's PPT. Classmates started teasing below. Yang Fangfang looked at the photo and began to ponder.
0:52:52|0:53:8|[Yang Fangfang] pressed the end call button heavily, the anger in her heart rising rapidly. The impatient tone of [Guo Yang] on the phone kept echoing in her ears. She walked dejectedly towards the dormitory, then suddenly stopped as if she remembered something. Soon after, a smile reappeared on her face.
0:53:13|0:53:22|[Yang Fangfang] paid no attention to her roommate's surprise, and her actions of packing her luggage became faster and faster. At this moment, she wished she could fly back to Kaili directly to meet her beloved.
0:53:22|0:53:41|On the train to Kaili, [Yang Fangfang] sat by the window, enjoying the scenery outside. A happy smile appeared on her face from time to time as familiar buildings gradually came into view. Unable to contain her excitement, [Yang Fangfang] stood up.
0:53:41|0:53:52|A few hours later, [Yang Fangfang] arrived at [Guo Yang]'s school with her suitcase.
0:53:56|0:54:3|Yang Fangfang then walked towards the direction pointed by the boy. The thought of soon seeing Guo Yang made Yang Fangfang's steps quicken.
0:54:3|0:54:17|At the bottom of the dormitory building, [Yang Fangfang] picked up her phone and called [Guo Yang]. She eagerly told [Guo Yang] about her arrival and then sat on the steps nearby, waiting for him.
0:54:17|0:54:37|On a chilly night, [Yang Fangfang] tightly hugged her arms and looked at the path ahead. The people passing by the dormitory were scattered, but she never saw a familiar face. She stood up and rubbed her cold hands, then turned around to see her shadow on the wall. She gestured with her fingers to mimic a little dog and played with it absentmindedly.
0:54:37|0:54:42|Suddenly, another little dog appeared on the wall,
0:55:30|0:55:45|The two of them returned to the hotel again. At this time, [Yang Fangfang], who had just finished showering, was blow-drying her hair, while [Guo Yang] walked out of the bathroom after finishing his own grooming.
0:55:48|0:56:2|[Guo Yang] took the hairdryer from [Yang Fangfang]'s hand, pressed the button somewhat clumsily. [Yang Fangfang] shyly lowered her head as he played with her hair, [Guo Yang] finished one side and then turned to the other. [Yang Fangfang] felt his care and protection from the bottom of her heart.
0:56:2|0:56:10|The corners of her mouth curved into a happy smile. She then looked up at [Guo Yang]'s face, who was earnestly taking care of her hair.
0:56:11|0:56:21|[Yang Fangfang] knew she was already immersed in [Guo Yang]'s thoughtfulness. She raised her hands and tightly embraced this warmth that belonged to her, feeling [Yang Fangfang]'s response. [Guo Yang] smiled even more happily.
0:56:23|0:56:47|The person in his arms was expressing his longing intensely. [Guo Yang] stopped the hairdryer in his hand and kept stroking her hair with both hands. Then [Guo Yang] pinched her cheeks with his hands, and [Yang Fangfang] slowly lifted her head. [Guo Yang] gently supported the back of her head and leaned down, as [Yang Fangfang] slowly closed her eyes. [Guo Yang]'s kisses landed on her forehead, nose, and finally met her lips.
0:56:47|0:56:54|[Yang Fangfang] opened her eyes, looked at the man who fascinated her, and closed her eyes contentedly to enjoy the wonderful moment.
0:56:54|0:57:5|Guo Yang's kiss became more intense, and Yang Fangfang was already immersed in this wonderful feeling and unable to extricate herself. She desperately tilted her head back, eagerly anticipating the meeting of their tongues.
0:57:5|0:57:21|At this moment, [Guo Yang] pressed his body down, overpowering [Yang Fangfang] on the bed. As [Yang Fangfang] opened her eyes, she met his confused and infatuated gaze. The strong scent of hormones began to fill the room, followed by [Guo Yang]'s kiss attacking once again, leaving no chance to catch a breath.
0:57:21|0:57:43|[Yang Fangfang] once again lost consciousness in this unrestrained invasion, unknowingly the clothes on both of them had already been stripped off, [Guo Yang] looked at [Yang Fangfang] beneath him with love in his eyes, at this moment [Yang Fangfang]'s hand was propped on [Guo Yang]'s shoulder, then she slowly closed her eyes, at this moment [Guo Yang]'s kiss began to become gentle, he slowly moved his body to occupy this tenderness.
0:57:43|0:57:58|[Yang Fangfang]'s tense body is gradually relaxing at this moment. She is starting to get used to [Guo Yang]'s gentle yet intense attack. Instead of feeling the pain on her body, she feels that this is a sincere delivery of each other's hearts.
0:57:59|0:58:24|In the classroom, the sound of the piano is melodious and beautiful. [Guo Yang] is seen sitting in front of the piano, his well-defined fingers skillfully moving on the black and white keys. He then turns his head to look at [Yang Fangfang] sitting beside him. [Yang Fangfang] immediately understands and smiles sweetly. She slowly raises her hand, and her small fingers play crisp chords. [Guo Yang] follows the rhythm and starts playing along.
0:58:24|0:58:30|The beautiful sound of the piano echoed in the classroom. The affection in their eyes deepened even more.
0:58:31|0:58:37|The harmonious duet once again brought them closer, the silhouette of the two tightly leaning against each other looked so sweet.
0:58:37|0:58:58|After a night of passionate revelry, [Yang Fangfang] lay beside [Guo Yang], gently caressing his forehead and nose with her fingers. The love in her eyes deepened as her fingers eventually landed on Guo Yang's lips. Just as she continued to stroke the sleeping Guo Yang, he suddenly opened his eyes and swiftly grabbed [Yang Fangfang]'s hand, rolling on top of her.
0:58:59|0:59:20|The next day, [Guo Yang] took [Yang Fangfang] to the cinema. Watching the poignant love story in the film, [Yang Fangfang] was moved to tears. Suddenly, [Guo Yang] leaned on her shoulder, and [Yang Fangfang] looked down at his sleeping face and smiled. Then she looked up again to appreciate the precious love story in front of her. In the evening, the two of them played a game of "Pictionary".
0:59:21|0:59:31|[Yang Fangfang] knew [Guo Yang]'s thoughts and gave him a disapproving look, saying,
0:59:48|0:59:56|[Yang Fangfang] lied to her mother, while [Guo Yang] sat beside her, laughing and joking. She quickly put her finger in front of her mouth to signal [Guo Yang] to be quiet.
0:59:56|1:0:3|Young love dared not easily let family members know, [Yang Fangfang] gave her impulsive courage for love to her only first love.
1:0:3|1:0:9|The days passed by, every minute and every second spent with [Guo Yang] made [Yang Fangfang] feel joyful.
1:0:9|1:0:16|The next day, the two of them arrived at the lakeside. [Guo Yang] rode a bicycle, with [Yang Fangfang] sitting on the back holding onto him.
1:1:2|1:1:12|[Yang Fangfang] said nothing, just shook her head silently. [Guo Yang] pedaled the bicycle again, but this time [Yang Fangfang] did not put her hands on his waist, instead she gripped the bottom of the seat.
1:1:22|1:1:28|At noon that day, the two of them came to the school cafeteria to eat. [Yang Fangfang] put all the meat from the dishes into [Guo Yang]'s bowl.
1:2:8|1:2:19|[Guo Yang] hurriedly caught up, [Yang Fangfang] wiped away a tear and turned around to say.
1:2:31|1:2:41|[Yang Fangfang] shook off [Guo Yang]'s hand while speaking, leaving [Guo Yang] feeling confused and at a loss on how to salvage the situation. As he watched [Yang Fangfang] walk away resolutely, he couldn't help but start sobbing.
1:2:41|1:3:5|At this moment, [Yang Fangfang] turned around and stood in silence, refusing to acknowledge [Guo Yang] behind her. When she heard him crying like a child, her heart ached too. Reflecting on the hurtful words she said in anger, [Yang Fangfang] realized she had gone too far. She slowly approached and embraced [Guo Yang] once again.
1:3:5|1:3:10|The beautiful love story encounters its first setback, maybe they should give each other some time. 
1:3:14|1:3:21|[Yang Fangfang] stood at the stairs of the waiting hall and looked back. Down below, [Guo Yang] was making faces at her, but she still couldn't bring herself to smile.
1:3:22|1:3:36|Shortly after, she turned around to continue carrying her luggage up the stairs. After a few steps, she turned back again, only to see [Guo Yang] still standing motionless in place, watching her leave. [Yang Fangfang] couldn't help but smile when she saw [Guo Yang]'s smile.
1:3:36|1:3:46|Parting is to meet better, [Yang Fangfang] silently persuades herself in her heart. She picks up her luggage and walks up the stairs again, this time without looking back, and she dares not look back anymore.
1:3:46|1:3:52|Shortly after, she sat on the bus returning to school, with no expression on [Yang Fangfang]'s face.
1:4:56|1:5:6|The mysterious person that Wu Xiaoyu mentioned is the one who struck up a conversation on the train in Guangzhou, [Yang Fangfang], who was focused on eating and unwilling to say more, bringing the unpleasant meal to an end.
1:5:6|1:5:27|That day, [Yang Fangfang] left the evening self-study and walked towards the dormitory. Everywhere on the road leading to the dormitory were couples hugging each other. [Yang Fangfang] stood still watching others cuddling, thinking once again of the time spent with [Guo Yang]. Then she slowly moved her feet forward, but her eyes never left the couples sticking together.
1:5:27|1:5:42|In her eyes, there was envy mixed with a hint of jealousy. Then she quickly ran towards the dormitory with her head down. Upon returning to the dorm, [Yang Fangfang] started packing her luggage. Her roommate, who came back after washing up, saw her and asked,
1:5:53|1:6:11|[Yang Fangfang] caught the last train back to Kaili. She stood in the corridor, fanning away the smell of smoke, feeling drowsy. She had to crouch in a corner of the aisle, resting her head on her elbow. When she arrived at the dormitory building, she called [Guo Yang].
1:6:34|1:6:46|Upon seeing [Yang Fangfang] appear with a suitcase, the smile on [Guo Yang]'s face from a distance abruptly disappeared. [Yang Fangfang] stared at [Guo Yang] with red eyes for a long time, then she turned and walked away, with [Guo Yang] following after her.
1:6:48|1:7:13|No matter how much [Guo Yang] shouted, [Yang Fangfang] still didn't stop and walked straight towards the teaching building. A timely apology temporarily calmed the anger in [Yang Fangfang]'s heart. She looked up at the aggrieved [Guo Yang] in front of her, and unknowingly, her heart softened again. Then the two of them returned to the hotel to rest.
1:7:13|1:7:31|In the room, [Yang Fangfang] lay on the bed sulking, while [Guo Yang] sat on the other side of the bed watching a game. She angrily pulled back the covers, but he didn't pay any attention. [Yang Fangfang] stood up and deliberately walked past him, but [Guo Yang] turned his head away, never looking at her once from start to finish.
1:8:42|1:8:52|The busy voice of [Guo Yang] on the phone echoed in her ears, [Yang Fangfang] looked at the disconnected screen with a mix of anger and helplessness. Sitting in the library, [Yang Fangfang] felt restless and had no intention of studying.
1:8:52|1:8:59|She looked out the window, then glanced at the classmates studying around her. The quiet atmosphere at that moment made her feel even more suppressed inside.
1:8:59|1:9:6|She reached out and picked up the phone at the corner of the table, but there were no messages. Faced with [Guo Yang]'s indifference, [Yang Fangfang] could no longer bear it.
1:9:6|1:9:12|She slammed the pen on the table and walked out with her phone in hand. As she walked, she dialed [Guo Yang]'s number.
1:9:17|1:9:30|Yang Fangfang, who hung up the phone, couldn't calm down for a long time. Guo Yang's neglect and indifference towards her were not once or twice. The more she thought about it, the angrier she became, her chest heaving up and down uncontrollably.
1:9:30|1:9:39|Winter vacation arrived, [Yang Fangfang] and Wu Xiaoyu sat on the train heading home.
1:9:39|1:9:47|[Yang Fangfang] couldn't believe her ears. She turned to look at Wu Xiaoyu and asked,
1:10:32|1:10:39|[Yang Fangfang] turned her head and said nothing more. The way Wu Xiaoyu let go so freely was probably something she could never achieve.
1:10:41|1:11:4|The phone rang again, and [Yang Fangfang] immediately jumped out of bed to grab the phone. Looking at the call from [Guo Yang], her originally excited heart was filled with an unnamed anger. She pushed the chair away and sat at the desk, glancing at the phone screen before putting it down. The phone kept ringing, and [Yang Fangfang]'s conflicted heart gradually became restless.
1:11:29|1:11:54|[Yang Fangfang] slammed down her chopsticks, picked up the nearby phone and returned to her room. Her brother brought his girlfriend home for dinner, a feeling of being ignored by her family completely infuriated [Yang Fangfang]. She took her phone back to her bedroom, waiting for [Guo Yang] to call again. Before long, her brother pushed open the door and [Yang Fangfang] glanced at the doorway without saying anything.
1:12:11|1:12:21|After her brother finished speaking and left the bedroom, [Yang Fangfang] let out a deep sigh, resting her head on her hand on the desk. Her mind was in turmoil, and she had no more energy to care about anything else.
1:12:23|1:12:32|The phone rang again, and [Yang Fangfang] pressed the answer button. After resolving the conflict, the next day [Yang Fangfang] immediately came to the school to look for [Guo Yang].
1:12:32|1:12:41|The door of the hotel room opens, and [Yang Fangfang] smiles at [Guo Yang] outside the door. The two, who haven't seen each other for a long time, embrace tightly.
1:12:42|1:12:53|Guo Yang let go of his arm and looked at Yang Fangfang in his arms, asking. Emotions came and went quickly.
1:12:53|1:13:17|The previous conflicts and issues were all thrown aside by the two, [Guo Yang]'s kiss gradually broke down [Yang Fangfang]'s defenses, the long-missed affection burst forth at this moment, the two of them lost in the moment as they passionately kissed, [Yang Fangfang] closed her eyes and savored [Guo Yang]'s longing for her, then a gentle kiss landed on her forehead, a smile unconsciously appeared on her lips, [Yang Fangfang] felt at this moment that she was the happiest person in the world.
1:13:17|1:13:30|[Guo Yang] smiled as he carried her towards the bed, [Yang Fangfang] understood her intentions, blushing as she lowered her head. Soon after, she fell onto the soft mattress, the overwhelming weight on her body completely conquering her.
1:13:30|1:13:39|In the bathroom, [Yang Fangfang] is taking a shower, while [Guo Yang] quietly pushes the door open and peeks in halfway.
1:13:44|1:13:54|[Yang Fangfang] pushed [Guo Yang], who was deliberately pouting, out of the door with a smile. As she turned around, she couldn't help but chuckle at the pitiful look in [Guo Yang]'s eyes.
1:13:54|1:14:1|After a while, [Yang Fangfang] walked out of the bathroom with a smile on her face. She saw [Guo Yang] sitting neatly on the edge of the bed, looking puzzled.
1:14:15|1:14:23|[Yang Fangfang] looked up and met [Guo Yang]'s expectant gaze, then slowly lowered her head and said,
1:14:33|1:14:54|[Yang Fangfang] watched as the excited [Guo Yang] hesitated to speak, but he just walked away without looking back. She could only stand in place, staring at his departing figure. As she watched the closed door, her heart was filled with loneliness. Looking at the room that had just been filled with tenderness, her heart felt as cold as an ice cellar. Clearly, she didn't want him to leave, so why couldn't he see through her sadness?
1:14:54|1:15:13|As the time grew later, [Yang Fangfang] picked up her phone and dialed [Guo Yang]'s number, but it was unreachable. Growing even angrier, she threw her phone aside and started getting dressed. Since the other party seemed completely indifferent, she saw no reason to stay any longer.
1:15:20|1:15:26|[Yang Fangfang]'s hand hesitated in the air as she opened the door, afraid that she might miss something if she left now.
1:15:26|1:15:38|Perhaps [Guo Yang] is on her way back at the moment. She then returned to the sofa and sat down again, sitting there slowly waiting for the grievances and fears in her heart to turn into tears.
1:15:38|1:15:45|[Yang Fangfang] doesn't understand the meaning of her long journey here.
1:15:48|1:16:6|In the morning, [Yang Fangfang] was awakened by the sound of knocking on the door. Hearing that it was [Guo Yang] outside, she eagerly got up to open the door. When she realized that [Guo Yang] had not returned all night, she angrily threw off the covers, grabbed her backpack, and walked out with her packed suitcase.
1:16:11|1:16:18|[Guo Yang] impatiently asked when he saw the luggage in [Yang Fangfang]'s hands.
1:16:24|1:16:41|[Guo Yang] watched as [Yang Fangfang] stormed out of the door, feeling a sense of agitation rising within him. As he watched her disappearing down the corridor at an increasing pace, a surge of anger built up in [Guo Yang]'s heart. Leaning against the door without moving, there was no hint of nostalgia in his eyes. [Guo Yang] felt that in this relationship, he had had enough of [Yang Fangfang]'s antics.
1:16:43|1:16:49|At this moment, [Yang Fangfang] was running forward quickly with a suitcase in hand, panting heavily but never stopping.
1:16:49|1:17:14|From coming out of the room until now, she did not hear any retention from [Guo Yang]. Slowly, she stopped and looked back, but there was no familiar figure behind her. Looking at the vast square, the grievance surged in [Yang Fangfang]'s heart. [Guo Yang]'s heartlessness deeply pierced her heart. Back home, [Yang Fangfang] lay on the bed listlessly.
1:17:14|1:17:21|Thinking of her helplessness in the square, tears flowed uncontrollably. Remembering the happy moments spent with [Guo Yang],
1:17:21|1:17:28|The pain in her heart was like a knife cutting, she tightly clutched a corner of the pillow, trying hard not to cry out loud. 
1:17:28|1:17:44|Since the day he came back until now, [Guo Yang] has never contacted her. The breakup was initiated by herself, and it seems like she is the only one feeling sad. It's not a solution to be sad alone like this. [Yang Fangfang] held back her tears and decided to go to the school to look for [Guo Yang].
1:17:44|1:17:54|She immediately threw off the covers and got out of bed, picked up the clothes hanging on the wall and ran out. [Yang Fangfang] came to [Guo Yang]'s school without hesitation, and began to search for [Guo Yang] everywhere.
1:17:54|1:18:14|Once again, standing by the lake where the two used to ride bicycles, looking around, there were only a few pedestrians passing by. [Yang Fangfang] stood on the bridge, afraid of missing every corner. She looked around persistently, feeling as restless as ants on a hot pan. She hoped to see [Guo Yang], hoping that the two could reconcile and the familiar past flooded her heart.
1:18:14|1:18:20|[Yang Fangfang] is determined to find [Guo Yang], but she searched for him all day without success.
1:18:20|1:18:39|At night, [Yang Fangfang] came to the bottom of the boys' dormitory, silently waiting for the appearance of [Guo Yang]. Her eyes, swollen from crying, stared at the door, and the cold autumn wind blew through. [Yang Fangfang] was already numb from the cold. Just as she was thinking about how to speak to [Guo Yang], a figure appeared at the door, the person she had been longing for was right in front of her.
1:18:39|1:18:52|[Yang Fangfang] instantly smiled when she saw [Guo Yang] coming out of the building, but he didn't even notice her. She was about to greet him when she was heartbroken by what happened next - [Guo Yang] walked straight to another girl.
1:18:52|1:19:0|The smile on [Yang Fangfang]'s face suddenly disappeared, the name she was about to shout out was also swallowed back, watching their figures getting farther and farther away, until they disappeared from sight.
1:19:0|1:19:3|[Yang Fangfang] finally recovered from the sadness.
1:19:3|1:19:10|She still couldn't believe it as she watched [Guo Yang] and the unfamiliar girl disappear in the distance, her eyes gradually turning red.
1:19:10|1:19:32|After leaving school, [Yang Fangfang] walked aimlessly on the street, tears streaming down her face. Passersby looked at her as she wiped her tears away, the bustling street crowded with people, streetlights seemingly illuminating every corner of the city.
1:19:32|1:19:41|[Yang Fangfang] walked alone on the street, recalling the moments spent with [Guo Yang], and then thinking about the scenes she saw today, [Yang Fangfang] felt even more suffocated in her heart.
1:19:41|1:19:49|In [Guo Yang]'s eyes, she realized that she could be easily replaced by others at any time, and tears welled up uncontrollably as she thought about it.
1:19:53|1:19:59|Alone outside, [Yang Fangfang] squats on the road crying, with passersby looking at her.
1:19:59|1:20:11|On the bus ride home, [Yang Fangfang] had stopped crying. With red eyes, she sat there blankly, lost in thought. No one knew what she had been through, and no one knew what was going on in her mind.
1:20:11|1:20:25|The bus slowly moved forward, and [Yang Fangfang]'s heart also slowly calmed down. She pursed her lips silently digesting the pain of heartbreak, tears slowly welling up in her eyes. She immediately lifted her head, stubbornly preventing the tears from flowing.
1:21:25|1:21:37|[Yang Fangfang] came to Wu Xiaoyu's house, the two of them picked up the wine glasses on the table and drank them up, then she leaned on the balcony looking into the distance, while Wu Xiaoyu behind her was coaxing the child.
1:21:57|1:22:7|Wu Xiaoyu's question is exactly the same as the question in [Yang Fangfang]'s heart. She doesn't know if she should go see this man who once caused her pain, and what kind of scene it would be if they meet again.
1:22:7|1:22:28|At this moment, [Yang Fangfang] has already boarded the taxi heading to the agreed meeting point. The tunnel lights are reflecting on her face. The [Yang Fangfang] who used to have long hair and ran for love now looks like a grown-up. She has short and neat hair, a composed expression, and a calm gaze looking straight ahead. She is about to go to meet that man.
1:22:28|1:22:34|She walked on the street, looking at the shops with lights on the roadside, with a hint of joy in her eyes.
1:22:34|1:22:58|[Yang Fangfang] was wearing a pink suit and a floral dress as she walked down the alley, the clacking sound of her high heels following her. She looked around searching for that coffee shop, and as she turned around, she saw the familiar profile in the glass window. In that instant, the same smile that appeared on [Yang Fangfang]'s face when she saw [Guo Yang] in the past reappeared. Realizing she had lost control, she immediately suppressed the smile.
1:22:58|1:23:5|She understood that this meeting didn't mean anything. He was no longer the original [Guo Yang], and she was no longer the original [Yang Fangfang].
1:23:5|1:23:14|Thinking of this, she smiled bitterly to herself, then composed herself and walked towards the coffee shop. At this moment, [Guo Yang] was still casually flipping through books in the coffee shop.
1:23:14|1:23:21|This meeting also made him feel a little nervous, the impulsive actions of his youth putting an end to this immature love.
1:23:21|1:23:40|This time's proactive invitation may be considered as making up for past mistakes. [Yang Fangfang] walked into the store, her heart couldn't help but beat faster. At this moment, she was one step closer to [Guo Yang], and the side of his face became clearer. [Guo Yang]'s thick eyebrows and high nose bridge remained unchanged from before, just with an added sense of maturity and steadiness.
1:23:40|1:23:47|She walked slowly to the dining table, smiling and greeted [Guo Yang] proactively. The seated [Guo Yang] immediately stood up and responded with a smile.
1:24:0|1:24:12|No one wants to dwell on the right or wrong of the past, just cherish the present time. When we were young, we didn't know how to love, we just stuck to each other tightly. We also didn't know how to protect love when we were young.
1:24:24|1:24:31|[Yang Fangfang] walked out of the coffee shop, looking at the street singer, recalling the day she said goodbye, and also letting go in her heart.
