0:2:56|0:3:9|As the exclamation sounded, a simple ox cart was stopped at the gate of the Lu Kingdom palace. The person leading the ox cart was Yan Hui. He took out a small stool and placed it on the ground, carefully helping a person down from the ox cart.
0:3:16|0:3:44|In the year 501 BC, during the reign of Duke Ding of Lu, the political power of the state of Lu was controlled by the three noble families known as the Three Huan - the Ji family, the Shu family, and the Meng family. When Confucius arrived at the entrance of the inner hall, he prepared to perform the ritual between ruler and subject by clasping his hands together, but he ignored the words of the attendants. He then knelt down with his hands apart, bowed his head and saluted, despite the displeasure on the attendants' faces. They dared not speak more and could only stand by patiently waiting for him.
0:3:44|0:4:6|Confucius raised his head, looking hopefully at the magnificent hall in front of him. He bowed again and needed to pass through a long corridor before entering the inner hall. Confucius left his shoes at one end of the corridor and followed closely behind the others. Through the corridor, he could clearly see the figures of two people. A servant stood at the door, and after reporting to the inner hall, he stepped aside.
0:4:6|0:4:14|Respectfully gestured to [Confucius] to go ahead alone. [Confucius] followed the gesture and walked into the central hall.
0:4:14|0:4:22|Facing the front, bowing again, taking two steps forward, kneeling on the cushion, bowing with head lowered.
0:4:24|0:4:36|After the announcement, several attendants entered the inner hall carrying tripods and wine vessels. A man dressed in black court attire followed behind them, he was the ruler of the State of Lu, Duke Ding of Lu, [Ji Sunsi].
0:6:1|0:6:28|Duke Ding of Lu had a look of inscrutable expression in his eyes, shining and compelling. At this moment, a funeral was taking place in the mountains. A group of soldiers dressed in white solemnly held up white canopies, while some others held giant ox horns. A white figure swiftly passed through the woods, a child of eleven or twelve, looking back in panic as if afraid of being chased. On the altar stood a man wearing mourning clothes and a mourning cap.
0:6:28|0:6:39|He is the leader of the Three Huan families, the Lu official [Ji Sunsi]. [Ji Sunsi] was seen holding a bamboo staff, stretching out his arms, howling in grief, and the people below looked equally devastated.
0:6:39|0:6:48|A group of wizards danced around the brazier, while the women knelt on the ground, unable to hide their panic on their faces. Suddenly, Ji Sunsi's steward knelt anxiously below the altar.
0:7:4|0:7:12|74 Qi Sigong ran through the woods, continuing down the grassy slope, with a group of fierce soldiers following closely behind him about ten meters away.
0:7:15|0:7:46|Before long, Ji Sunsi arrived at the market. The streets were crowded with people, leaving him no time to dodge. He had to push through the crowd, running desperately forward. As the soldiers behind him drew their bows, an arrow pierced Ji Sunsi's left arm. Despite the pain, he dared not stop and continued running forward. Without a word, he drew his sword as the soldiers approached, causing them to hesitate and stop in their tracks.
0:8:34|0:8:58|At this moment, a horse-drawn carriage with four horses is being pulled into a cave by two attendants. On the carriage lies a heavy coffin, with several servants carrying bronze trays, walking quickly towards the cave. Soon, several soldiers lift a coffin with intricate patterns and carefully place it into the chamber. This cave is the tomb that [Ji Sunsi] had renovated for his father, Ji Pingzi.
0:8:58|0:9:19|Inside the cave, as the soldiers closed the final layer of the wrapped chamber, outside the cave, the soldiers dragged the women in. Whenever they encountered disobedience, the soldiers' whips mercilessly struck them. These war horses and women were all sacrificial offerings for Ji Pingzi. After dealing with the war horses, the soldiers then turned their weapons towards these women, stabbing or slashing at them.
0:9:19|0:9:39|Before long, everyone's lives were at stake. After dealing with everything, the soldiers left the cave in an orderly manner. It was unclear how much time had passed when a little girl woke up and looked around in confusion.
0:9:49|0:10:7|The girl could not hide her inner fear any longer. Finally, in despair, she turned around to see nothing but a pile of corpses. In the sealed stone cave, the air became thinner and thinner, and the only candlestick went out completely after the oxygen was depleted.
0:10:7|0:10:23|Daylight broke, and [Zilu] led the ox cart through the streets and alleys. As they passed by, pedestrians would bow respectfully to the people on the cart. Soon, the ox cart stopped in front of a thatched cottage, with [Zilu] following behind [Confucius].
0:10:25|0:10:29|[Zilu] hurriedly ran into the house after receiving the order.
0:10:29|0:10:47|[Confucius] returned the gesture to his student who bowed to him in the courtyard, then continued walking towards the house. He passed through the classroom, looking with satisfaction at the students who were studying diligently.
0:10:58|0:11:5|[Confucius's wife Qiguan] scooped a bowl of hot soup from the stove and had her daughter [Confucius's daughter Jiao] bring it to [Confucius].
0:11:11|0:11:19|[Confucius], dressed in casual clothes, smiled at his daughter. His wife came up from behind, wrapped her arms around his waist, and tied his bag for him.
0:11:25|0:11:38|Suddenly, the bamboo slips on the bamboo box fell down, accompanied by a muffled groan from a child. [Confucius] looked worriedly at the back of the bamboo box, then looked helplessly at his father, only to see Qi Sis curled up in the corner.
0:12:0|0:12:6|Confucius's student Zilu knelt on the ground, explaining with a helpless expression,
0:12:25|0:12:34|Suddenly, the steward of the Ji family led a group of soldiers into Confucius's courtyard. The weak scholar couldn't stop the aggressive soldiers at all, and the group arrived at the doorway of the inner room.
0:12:46|0:12:55|Upon seeing their teacher, Confucius's students hurriedly ran over and stood behind him.
0:13:0|0:13:32|Gongshan Niu fixedly stared at [Confucius], then took a few steps forward with soldiers. [Confucius] fearlessly took a step forward, and in an instant, both sides drew their swords. [Confucius] raised his hand to block Zilu's sword, looking meaningfully at Gongshan Niu. When Zilu sheathed his sword, Gongshan Niu's face showed a hint of a smile. He gestured to the side, and after a moment of silence, [Confucius] walked a few steps to the side.
0:13:44|0:13:55|Confucius remained calm with his eyes lowered, looking ambiguous. Gongshan Niu couldn't help but move closer, and only then did Confucius turn his head and put on a polite smile.
0:14:2|0:14:24|Gongshan Ni's expression suddenly turned cold, he looked at [Confucius] with resentment, and left the courtyard with the soldiers. It was time for the morning court session. The courtiers lined up neatly and walked towards the main hall. After Duke Ding of Lu took his seat, the others knelt and sat in order on the cushions, [Confucius] among them.
0:14:55|0:15:16|[Ji Sunsi] stood in the center of the hall, clapping his hands towards the outside of the hall. Four soldiers carried a wooden box towards the hall, but instead of placing it directly in the center, they carried it around the ministers with a long-tailed pheasant. It seemed like they wanted everyone to see it, and the ministers passed around the pheasant tail that [Ji Sunsi] held in his hand.
0:15:16|0:15:22|Only [Confucius] remained silent, not even bothering to look up.
0:16:8|0:16:22|Mengsun He, one of the three Huan brothers, looked towards Duke Ding of Lu, while Shusun Wu led the applause, and the surrounding ministers also echoed.
0:16:52|0:17:0|Zilu, with Qisi Gong, knelt in the center of the hall to pay respects to Duke Ding of Lu, when [Ji Sunsi] suddenly grabbed Qisi Gong by the back of the neck.
0:18:11|0:18:20|Confucius came to the side of Nan Zi, facing Duke Ding of Lu together. They bowed deeply and some ministers followed suit, while Duke Ding's face showed anger.
0:18:36|0:18:42|Gongshan Niubi spoke while scrutinizing the attitudes of the crowd, revealing a smug expression.
0:19:10|0:19:17|[Confucius] calmly walked towards Gongshan Niu, who nervously turned his head and dared not look at [Confucius].
0:19:35|0:19:42|[Confucius] helped up Qi Siguang, who was kneeling on the ground, while [Ji Sunsi] stood with his hands behind his back in the center of the hall.
0:19:49|0:20:7|The crowd watched [Ji Sunsi] in silence, with only Shusun Wu looking worried, his eyes filled with fear as he gazed at him. After saying these words, [Ji Sunsi] walked out of the hall and returned.
0:20:7|0:20:15|During the ceremony to accept Qi Siguang as a student, his left sleeve was empty, so he could only raise his right arm.
0:20:15|0:20:19|Respectfully bowing, [Confucius] clasped his hands in a gesture of courtesy.
0:20:19|0:20:28|However, Qi Siguang did not rise according to the etiquette, but remained prostrated on the ground, unable to get up.
0:21:9|0:21:37|The crowd turned to look and saw Zilu walking in with a huge clay jar in his hands. He approached [Confucius], filled his bowl with wine, and soon all the students below also brought up a bowl of wine, including Qisigong. Then [Confucius] raised his wine cup, everyone raised their cups in response, and they all drank it in one gulp.
0:21:38|0:21:52|Fellow disciples burst into laughter, while [Yan Hui] smiled and held Qi Sigong in his arms, wiping away the wine sprayed from his mouth, as the sky gradually darkened.
0:21:52|0:21:59|At this moment, in the palace of the State of Qi, the Qi state official Li Chu came to pay respects to Duke Jing of Qi,
0:23:1|0:23:9|It was late at night, yet the lights were still on in the house of [Confucius]. [Confucius] was seen standing with his disciples in front of a map.
0:23:45|0:24:1|Whispering in the ear of Ran Qiu, two military officers approached [Confucius]. They bowed respectfully to [Confucius], who returned the gesture.
0:24:30|0:24:54|Time is of the essence. [Confucius] immediately drove himself with several students to Fei City. Just as the day was breaking, they arrived at the city gate of Fei City. An ancient and simple city gate stood before them, and once inside the city, [Confucius] kept frowning, solemnly surveying his surroundings.
0:25:4|0:25:24|The soldiers tied the hands of a group of commoners together and whipped them. Soon, Confucius arrived at the training ground where Ji Sunsi was. Confucius and Ji Sunsi sat facing each other, Ji Sunsi raised his wine cup as a gesture, and both of them drank it all in one go.
0:25:43|0:25:50|[Ji Sunsi] casually wiped his hands.
0:26:6|0:26:13|Ji Sunsi took a gulp of the wine brought by Yan Hui.
0:26:23|0:26:30|[Ji Sunsi] stood in front of the target, shooting to the right side of the tiger head target.
0:26:39|0:26:47|[Ji Sunsi] pulled the bowstring taut and shot directly at the tiger head target's bridge of the nose.
0:27:6|0:27:23|Confucius's arrow once again hit the tiger's whiskers, and his third arrow went straight into the tiger's forehead.
0:27:32|0:27:57|[Ji Sunsi] nodded knowingly, took an arrow and returned to his own target, while [Confucius] pulled the bowstring taut again. The fourth arrow hit the tiger's forehead, [Ji Sunsi] pulled back the bow and aimed at the tiger target, then closed his eyes and released the arrow.
0:28:18|0:28:26|Gongshan Niu sneered and waved his hand arrogantly.
0:28:35|0:28:44|He bowed to [Ji Sunsi], slowly untied the bandage wrapped around his hand, flexed his fingers, and the agreed meeting time with the State of Qi was approaching quickly.
0:28:44|0:29:0|The ceremonial team of Lu State slowly marched through the mountains, with Duke Ding of Lu riding in a carriage with [Confucius]. Ran Qiu drove the carriage and hurriedly ran to Duke Ding's side.
0:29:21|0:29:32|Duke Ding of Lu looked at Confucius with a puzzled expression, but received no response. Ran Qiu, who received the order, immediately drove back to prepare the second plan as instructed by Confucius.
0:29:32|0:29:54|The Lu state's ceremonial team quickly arrived at the agreed upon valley. Waiting for them in the valley were a group of solemn soldiers from the Qi state, holding long spears. [Confucius] stopped the carriage, tightened the sword at his waist. In front of them was a platform several tens of meters high, while on the other side of the canyon were thousands of troops holding up flags. [Confucius] nodded with a serious expression.
0:30:3|0:30:9|Yan Hui lifted his robe and stepped onto the high platform, with the ceremonial guards of the Qi state on both sides.
0:30:9|0:30:22|Holding up the flag of the State of Qi, Duke Ding of Lu led the people to the high platform and stopped to look out. Yan Hui quickly climbed to the highest point, while Duke Jing of Qi and his officials had been waiting for a long time.
0:30:32|0:30:56|Duke Jing of Qi nodded knowingly, slightly curling his lips, and a servant stepped forward to shout. Just as Duke Ding of Lu took a step forward, he was stopped by [Confucius], who lowered his eyes to look at Duke Ding's feet. Seeing this, Duke Ding could only awkwardly step back, while Yan Hui, noticing the situation, looked back at the people of Qi.
0:31:13|0:31:34|Duke Jing of Qi smiled and glanced at Li Ju, then waved his hand to signal everyone to follow him off the stage. Yan Hui saw Duke Jing of Qi stepping down and quickly followed suit. After Duke Jing of Qi and Li Ju walked down to the stage, they looked thoughtfully at the [Confucius] in front of them, leaving [Confucius] feeling at a loss under their scrutiny.
0:31:39|0:31:45|Both the states of Qi and Lu bowed to each other, and Duke Jing of Qi extended his hand in invitation.
0:31:49|0:32:8|Duke Jing of Qi smiled and reached out his hand to [Confucius], inviting him again. [Confucius] shook the hand extended by Duke Jing. Seeing the monarch had ascended the platform, [Confucius] and Li Ju made a courteous gesture, then followed up. Upon reaching the platform, the monarchs and ministers of the two states of Qi and Lu exchanged bows and gifts to show friendship.
0:32:8|0:32:33|After all the ceremonial procedures were completed, [Confucius] took two steps forward, sincerely looked at Duke Jing of Qi and bowed to him again. Duke Jing of Qi remained indifferent and did not respond, but [Confucius] looked at [Ji Sunsi] with a look of approval. After [Confucius] sat down, Duke Jing of Qi raised his wine cup, and then everyone else raised their cups and drank in unison.
0:32:34|0:32:41|The Qi state official Li Ju glanced at Duke Jing of Qi, [Confucius], [Nan Zi], and [Ji Sunsi].
0:33:38|0:33:52|[Ji Sunsi] looked at [Confucius] with a hint of disbelief, while Duke Jing of Qi had a stern expression, staring at him intently. However, [Confucius] did not flinch under Duke Jing's gaze.
0:34:2|0:34:8|Li Ji was furious and couldn't contain his anger. He stood up excitedly, gritting his teeth as he looked at the lord and his ministers of [Ji Sunsi].
0:34:15|0:34:42|Li Ji waved the military flag, and saw thousands of troops and horses rushing from the depths of the valley. [Confucius] remained calm, walked to the front of the platform with a sword in hand, and looked coldly at the warhorses and soldiers of the Qi state below the platform. Yan Hui held the flag of the Lu state, and after seeing the formation of the Qi state, he looked worriedly at [Confucius]. The Qi state's army quickly arrived below the platform and surrounded the few carriages of the Lu state, clearly showing Qi state's dominance over Lu state.
0:34:43|0:34:52|Upon receiving the command from [Confucius], Yan Hui also raised the military flag in his hand. The soldiers of the State of Lu received the order and shot the signal arrow straight into the sky.
0:35:9|0:35:20|[Confucius] waved his sword towards the outer side of the canyon, where a cloud of dust was rolling. Flocks of birds seemed startled and flew away, while Ran Qiu drove his chariot towards them. The soldiers of the Qi state saw this and stood in awe.
0:35:32|0:35:53|Confucius turned around, looking at the faces of the Qi state officials still with a gentle expression, but with a hint of cunning in his eyes. Outside the canyon, thick smoke billowed and deafening cries echoed, causing Li Ju to hesitate.
0:36:4|0:36:23|Duke Jing of Qi angrily swung his sleeves and glared at Li Ju. With no other choice, Li Ju raised the military flag again. The soldiers of Qi orderly retreated upon receiving the command, while the few men on the chariot of Ran Qiu excitedly patted the shoulders of the other side. Duke Ding of Lu leisurely stroked his beard and watched the troops withdraw from the stands.
0:36:42|0:36:48|Confucius's students were seen carrying large brooms,
0:36:57|0:37:8|In this diplomatic mission, the state of Lu can be said to have achieved a complete victory, reclaiming lost territory without using a single soldier. Everyone had smiles on their faces, happily walking back home.
0:37:8|0:37:21|At this time, the state of Wei was lush and green. A woman in plain white clothes was lying on the grass, looking very young, with skin like jade and a face like a peach blossom. Her smooth legs swayed gently.
0:37:28|0:37:35|Hearing the call, [Nan Zi] with a playful look on her face, picked up a bamboo slip and sneaked into the nearby woods.
0:37:51|0:38:18|The maidservants searched in vain and had to hurriedly run to the next location. Lady Jun, seeing the maidservants all leave, ran in another direction. Her skirt fluttered in the wind, revealing her slender legs. Dressed in plain clothes, she exuded unparalleled beauty. Lady Jun's face was filled with a pure smile. Soon, she arrived at the stable. Even the horses would glance sideways as she passed by. Familiar with the surroundings, she skillfully unfastened the iron chain hanging on the door.
0:38:18|0:38:23|Straight through the stables, not far ahead is the palace of the State of Wei.
0:38:44|0:38:51|Duke Ling of Wei, furious, turned around and was about to reprimand the Crown Prince when he suddenly looked towards the door with a face full of indulgence.
0:38:54|0:39:0|Duke Ling of Wei supported his wife, helping her to sit down first before he himself sat down on the other side.
0:39:0|0:39:9|Lady Wei [Nan Zi] fanned herself with a peacock feather fan, her gaze piercing,
0:40:31|0:40:43|The Crown Prince, unable to utter a word due to being choked, stormed out in anger. [Nan Zi], however, paid no attention to the Crown Prince's attitude and continued to elegantly fan herself.
0:41:29|0:41:34|At the Lu state court meeting, a servant presented two letters to [Ji Sunsi].
0:41:46|0:42:0|Uncle Sun Wu stopped the servant, picked up the bamboo slips and read them with a sneer of disdain on his face.
0:43:25|0:43:54|Duke Ding of Lu cunningly nurtured his own power. In 498 BC, [Confucius] served as the acting prime minister of Lu, and his mode of transportation changed from a ox cart to a horse carriage. Upon arriving at the palace, [Confucius] walked in with his attendants. As soon as he entered the palace, [Confucius] stopped, performed the ritual between ruler and minister, and paid his respects by kneeling down and kowtowing with Yan Hui, ignoring the attendants.
0:43:54|0:44:16|Upon entering the inner hall with the attendant, [Confucius] walked to the front of Duke Ding of Lu. Duke Ding looked at [Confucius] with undisguised admiration in his eyes, while [Ji Sunsi] sat with a cold expression on the side, never once looking directly at [Confucius]. [Confucius] took a few steps forward and bowed again, Duke Ding smiled at him and gestured for the attendant to present the new official robe.
0:44:16|0:44:33|Following that, Yan Hui took the robe from [Confucius] and knelt to the side. [Confucius] then bowed for the third time, completed the ritual, and shared a smile with Duke Ding of Lu.
0:44:58|0:45:6|The attendant smashed the flower-patterned stone basin and crawled on his knees in front of [Ji Sunsi].
0:45:10|0:45:24|[Ji Sunsi] calmly wiped the knife on his sleeve, then picked up a piece of raw meat from the cutting board and stuffed it into his mouth. He chewed the raw meat expressionlessly, then plunged the knife straight into the cutting board.
0:45:31|0:45:50|Qi Guanshi prepared the ink, then carefully handed the brush dipped in ink to [Confucius]. [Confucius] took the brush, adjusted the scroll, and began to write in a dignified manner. His wife patiently accompanied him on the side. After finishing a line, he handed the brush back to his wife. Once the ink dried, [Confucius] dipped some water from a nearby bowl and sprinkled it on the bamboo scroll.
0:45:56|0:46:10|[Confucius] rolled up the bamboo slips and handed them to Yan Hui. Then he picked up the documents Yan Hui had organized and started reading. The more he read, the more satisfied he looked.
0:47:10|0:47:20|After Confucius finished speaking, he walked out of the room without looking back. Yan Hui and the others stood in place, all with expressions of admiration on their faces.
0:47:20|0:47:28|But just now, Gongbo Liao, who was still dozing off to the side, slightly raised his eyelids and turned his gaze to the document left on the table, quickly,
0:48:5|0:48:20|Duke Ding of Lu stood up and squatted in front of [Confucius], with a sharpness typical of a monarch in his eyes.
0:49:43|0:50:2|Two soldiers drove a carriage towards Fei Yi, while on the grand hall of the State of Lu, a cockfight was in full swing. Only [Ji Sunsi] sat with narrowed eyes on the side, even Duke Ding of Lu was involved, pointing and shouting at the two chickens in the pit. The court at that moment resembled a marketplace.
0:50:48|0:50:55|Confucius looked up at Duke Ding of Lu, this matter is by no means that simple.
0:51:15|0:51:29|Gongshan Niu is a practical man. He immediately ordered his soldiers to rush to the capital of the State of Lu. They led horse-drawn carriages and pretended to be soldiers transporting grain. When they arrived at the city gate, the guards drew their swords and stopped Gongshan Niu's men.
0:51:39|0:51:53|Without waiting for the guard to finish speaking, [Confucius] took a step forward and stabbed the guard through, and the other soldiers, seeing this, also drew their weapons from the carriage and rushed into the city gate. Before long, [Confucius]'s army had taken control of the city gate.
0:51:56|0:52:5|The soldiers of [Confucius] entered the city and committed all kinds of atrocities, setting fire to the food piles and killing the guards they encountered.
0:52:5|0:52:12|The city was just taken too easily, causing the soldiers to be eager to follow the war chariot of [Nan Zi] and charge into the city.
0:52:22|0:52:30|Ran Qiu was seen driving a carriage towards the gate of the Ji Manor, with none other than Duke Ding of Lu and [Confucius] on board.
0:52:48|0:53:1|Gongshan Niu drove the chariot, leading the way with thousands of troops towards Wuzi Terrace. On the other side, [Ji Sunsi] tied the four rabbits he had hunted to the chariot frame, with the Ji family army standing ready behind him.
0:53:1|0:53:7|Confucius stood on the platform of Wuzi, while Sun Wu, who was anxious but silent, paced back and forth.
0:53:7|0:53:14|With a cold gaze, [Confucius] looked down at the continuously encircled army below, while [Nan Zi] raised his head to gaze up at the Wuzi Terrace.
0:53:25|0:53:36|At the command of Gongshan Niu, the soldiers behind him raised their bows and arrows, raining down arrows like the Wu Zitai. The soldiers raised their shields desperately to block them. [Confucius] glanced at the crowd below, then turned and beat the war drum.
0:53:38|0:53:51|With the command of Ran Qiu, the soldiers raised their shields and charged out. Gongshan Niu saw someone coming out and immediately swung his knife forward, leading the soldiers to kill towards the base of Wuzi.
0:53:52|0:54:11|The soldiers under Wuzi immediately withdrew back into the gate, while the soldiers on the platform pushed a large barrel filled with oil to the edge of the platform. The army of Gongshan Ni still had no idea. After Ran Qiu estimated the distance the army left Wuzi platform, he gave the order. The soldiers then threw torches into the oil barrel, and flames shot up three meters high in an instant.
0:54:13|0:54:45|The soldiers pulled apart the iron chains, and the oil tank immediately tilted downwards, pouring scalding hot oil along with billowing black smoke down the slope. Before the soldiers of Gongshan Niu could react, they were engulfed by the flames. Ran Qiu commanded the soldiers to pursue the advantage and shot a burning rocket towards the platform below. Gongshan Niu almost bit off a tooth, unable to believe what was happening before his eyes. At this moment, [Confucius] finally stopped beating the drum due to exhaustion, calmly looking towards the direction below Wuzi's platform, evidently the soldiers of Gongshan Niu.
0:54:45|0:54:56|The once arrogant and domineering individuals were now in a panic, running out in all directions. The raging fire continued to spread, and the soldiers below not only had to avoid the flames everywhere, but also dodge the arrows flying towards them.
0:54:56|0:55:18|Confucius frowned, looking at the fleeing soldiers in sorrow. They were too preoccupied to care about others. Some soldiers' armor and skin were on fire, emitting heart-wrenching screams. But Confucius knew that the strategy of Du San Du could be fully implemented. Several soldiers who first drove out of the inner city gate on a horse-drawn carriage were shot dead at the gate by the ambush set up by Ran Qiu.
0:55:18|0:55:35|As the crossbow bolts kept raining down, [Confucius]'s soldiers dwindled in number. They could only hold up their shields to barely withstand the attack of the bolts, falling one by one. [Confucius] himself, under the protection of a few trusted aides, moved towards the doorway in a disheveled manner.
0:56:0|0:56:19|Ji Sunsi's army had long been ambushed outside the city of Qufu. Upon seeing Confucius' people escaping through the city gate, they immediately surrounded them. Confucius widened his eyes, but his soldiers knew the situation was lost. They all laid down their weapons on the ground, hugged their heads, and squatted in place. Soon, a large chariot was transported outside the city of Feiyi.
0:56:19|0:56:23|With a loud crash, the city wall collapsed,
0:56:33|0:56:52|The crash carts, as tall as city walls, were tied with large wooden stakes. Soldiers pulled up the stakes and then released the ropes, allowing the stakes to crash into the city walls with inertia. Eight large crash carts were launched simultaneously, with thousands of soldiers operating them. The walls of Fei Yi were completely demolished, never to regain their former glory.
0:56:52|0:56:59|That day, the Grand Tutor [Ji Sunsi] walked with his hands behind his back on a piece of yellow earth. Soon he stopped and squinted his eyes.
0:56:59|0:57:7|It is impossible to tell what he is thinking just by his expression. After a while, he suddenly squatted down and grabbed a handful of yellow soil beneath his feet.
0:57:7|0:57:14|He then placed the hand grabbing the soil in front of his nose, silently sniffing. After the city wall was demolished,
0:57:14|0:57:28|[Confucius] was preparing to leave in his carriage, only to see soldiers shuttling back and forth among the ruins, carrying the bodies of [Confucius]'s subordinates. [Ji Sunsi] closed his eyes and slowly released his grip, quietly feeling the yellow earth slipping from his hands and scattering in the wind.
0:57:28|0:57:48|The soldiers continued to shuttle through the ruins in search of the wounded. As the soil in the hands of [Ji Sunsi] finally ran out, he casually shook it off, opened his eyes, stood up and looked ahead. What caught his eyes was the city of Fei, with only one gate left standing. He patted his hands covered in mud, calmly watching the people by the city wall carrying soil and food.
0:57:48|0:57:58|That day, [Ji Sunsi] was in front of his own stable, watering the war horses, while Sun Wu stood aside waving his sleeves disdainfully at the flies.
0:58:55|0:59:1|Ji Sunsi paid no attention to Meng Sunhe. At this moment, [Confucius] had just arrived at the gate of Ji's mansion and was stopped by the soldiers.
0:59:8|0:59:20|Ji Sunsi's military officer turned and ran towards the inner courtyard. With a scrutinizing gaze, Confucius stepped into the Ji family's courtyard, furrowing his brow. By chance, he saw two familiar carriages and the tightly closed gates of the inner courtyard.
0:59:45|0:59:56|Seeing the three Huan families gathered together, [Confucius] remained silent with pursed lips, then turned and walked towards the courtyard. At night, the soldiers camped outside the city of Fei Yi, with Ji Sunsi's deputy passing through the military camp.
1:0:8|1:0:14|After listening to Ran Qiu's words, Ji Sunsi's eyes darkened a few more degrees.
1:0:33|1:1:5|Facing the moonlight, Ji Sunfei rode in a carriage with Ji Sunsi towards the imperial palace. The next day, the gates of Chengyi city were tightly closed. Inside the city, Confucius walked into the military camp with a stern face, followed by his disciples. He took off the sword at his waist in front of the tent and casually threw it to his disciple behind him. As soon as Confucius stepped into the tent, he saw the hesitant Duke Ding of Lu pacing back and forth, looking somewhat annoyed at Confucius.
1:1:35|1:1:41|[Confucius] looked at Duke Ding of Lu in disbelief, gritting his teeth.
1:2:28|1:2:41|Duke Ding of Lu closed his eyes, steadied his emotions, then opened them again, looking at [Confucius] with eyes full of pity.
1:2:51|1:3:11|Duke Ding of Lu looked confused in his eyes, and [Confucius], upon hearing these words, raised his head slightly, as if the kind and amiable white-haired old man who had taught and guided him was sitting in front of him again.
1:4:21|1:4:33|It has been many days since the Qi army pressed the border. [Confucius] still occasionally recalls these words. He walks to the window, with a smile in his tears, full of nostalgia and admiration for Laozi.
1:4:33|1:4:40|In the palace of the State of Lu, musicians rhythmically struck the bianzhong, played the panpipes, and the sheng, among other instruments.
1:4:40|1:4:56|On the grand hall, a group of dancers in red dresses swayed gracefully, with the leading dancer lightly moving her sleeves and her enchanting face half-hidden behind a thin veil. The ministers sat around, watching with great interest, while only [Ji Sunsi] appeared absent-minded.
1:5:8|1:5:44|Uncle Sun Wu lazily leaned on the desk, answering Ji Sunsi's words. Duke Ding of Lu turned back and glanced at him, finally showing a smile. At this moment, Confucius was still standing by the window anxiously looking out. Kong Jiao walked to Confucius with a bowl in her hands. Confucius comfortingly patted Kong Jiao's shoulder and continued to look outside. Meanwhile, Ji Sunsi was half lying on the side when suddenly a servant came to him and whispered something. After listening, Ji Sunsi got up and walked towards the hall.
1:5:44|1:5:51|Gong Boliao respectfully bowed to [Ji Sunsi],
1:6:37|1:6:56|Confucius eagerly took the velvet cloth, opened it, and his smile froze on his face. He stared at the jade pendant in his hand for a while, then wrapped it back in the velvet cloth, but still held it tightly in his hand, unwilling to let go.
1:6:56|1:7:5|Confucius looked at Yujue in confusion, breaking his contemplation. He turned around and embraced his daughter.
1:7:12|1:7:17|At this moment, with a surge of fierce hatred in his originally sorrowful heart, [Confucius] turned to look at his son.
1:7:19|1:7:28|[Kong Li] dared not look at [Confucius], hesitated and spoke,
1:7:32|1:7:55|Confucius turned around, resting his chin on his daughter's forehead, his eyebrows twitching continuously. Then, he changed out of the new official robe given by Duke Ding of Lu, and walked out from the inner room wearing plain clothes. He stood calmly on the side, watching his wife concentrating on weaving. Lady Qi knew of Confucius's decision, she endured the fatigue and focused all her attention on weaving. Confucius understood her reluctance, and walked over to her.
1:7:55|1:8:9|Placing the new official robe on the loom, finally grasping his wife's hand as she pushes the loom, Qi Guan shi lowers her eyes, placing the hand held by [Confucius] on her chest, [Confucius] embraces Qi Guan shi's shoulder, gently pulling her into his arms.
1:8:21|1:8:32|[Kong Li] stood respectfully to the side, looking worriedly at his father. [Confucius] lowered his head, gave his son a reassuring look, and then reached out to tenderly touch his son's cheek.
1:8:33|1:8:42|Confucius couldn't bear to look at his wife, he held her hand and prepared to leave. Lady Qi shed tears and grabbed Confucius' hand, unwilling to let go.
1:8:42|1:8:57|[Confucius] paused for a moment, eventually withdrew his hand, and walked towards the door. The two children stood helplessly on the side, watching as he only placed a box of bamboo slips and a simple bedding on the long roofed carriage. [Confucius] seemed indifferent to the heavy rain, ready to set off.
1:8:57|1:9:9|Qi Guanshi leaned against the door frame, looking back at Confucius with reluctance. Confucius also had a hard time letting go, taking one last look at the door of the house.
1:9:10|1:9:35|After saying these words, he shouted and left without looking back, Qiguan Shi stood at the door, tears streaming down her face, watching [Confucius] leave. With her husband gone, she didn't know when they would meet again. [Confucius] walked alone in the pouring rain, struggling to lead the horse carriage forward. The road had become muddy and slippery from the rain. Suddenly, the front wheel of the carriage sank into a deep pit, causing [Confucius] to stumble.
1:9:35|1:9:39|The wheel is not deeply stuck, it will take some effort to pull it out.
1:9:39|1:10:0|[Confucius] shook his head in frustration and helplessness, then turned to grab the reins of the horse, preparing to pull it out. However, despite his repeated efforts to move forward with the horse, it remained in place, and the carriage did not budge at all. Feeling increasingly frustrated, [Confucius] yanked on the reins with all his might, causing them to break. He angrily pounded the muddy ground, preparing to stand up.
1:10:0|1:10:28|The pouring rain made it impossible for him to open his eyes, and he couldn't get up for a long time. He took a deep breath and unintentionally looked at the horse in front of him. The horse lowered its head as if apologizing, then shook its head several times, indicating for Confucius to stand up. Confucius suddenly burst into laughter, lying in the mud without caring about his image. After this outburst of emotions, he finally got up.
1:10:28|1:10:44|Leading the horse and continuing on the road, [Confucius] didn't know how long he had been walking. He had already left the city and arrived in a desolate wilderness. He seemed to be tireless, walking forward with his head down. Not far from him, a man with a backpack knelt by the roadside, obviously waiting for a long time.
1:10:44|1:11:7|[Confucius] was also stunned when he saw this man, who was his senior disciple Yan Hui. Like [Confucius], Yan Hui's luggage almost only contained bamboo slips. Yan Hui knelt down with tears in his eyes, looking up with a pleading and reluctant expression.
1:11:24|1:11:31|Yan Hui climbed forward, grabbed hold of Confucius's sleeve and refused to let go.
1:11:45|1:11:50|Yan Hui, with tears in his eyes, looked up at [Confucius] with an unprecedented determination in his gaze.
1:12:5|1:12:14|[Confucius] looked ahead and then turned to Yan Hui. Yan Hui shook his head earnestly at [Confucius], and then the two sat in place observing the changes in the situation.
1:12:27|1:12:36|Upon hearing Yan Hui's words, [Confucius] fell into contemplation.
1:12:45|1:12:54|Confucius looked at Yan Hui, as if he had understood many things from it.
1:13:0|1:13:12|Confucius articulated his thoughts word by word, when suddenly the sound of galloping hooves interrupted their conversation. Confucius looked up and saw his disciples running towards them, with Zilu leading the pack.
1:13:32|1:13:38|Seeing the sincere smiles of his disciples, [Confucius] was deeply moved, but for a moment he was speechless and unable to speak.
1:13:39|1:13:51|The disciples, seeing this, all knelt down in front of [Confucius], waiting quietly for his arrangement. This friendship could not be expressed in words, so he could only express his gratitude by bowing deeply.
1:13:51|1:14:16|Disciples also returned the greeting one after another. Suddenly, [Confucius] raised his head as if he had heard something. He put down his hand, stood up, and followed the sound. The disciples also stood up one after another. They saw [Confucius] approaching the carriage. When he saw the person sleeping soundly inside the carriage, a hint of a smile appeared on his face. He opened the carriage door and couldn't help but get closer. They saw Qi Siguang lying on a sack, sleeping sweetly with several scrolls of letters in his arms, unwilling to let go.
1:14:24|1:14:34|[Confucius] closed the carriage door and continued to move forward with his disciples. The team had grown larger at this point, and the atmosphere had become more lively as they proceeded in an orderly manner.
1:14:34|1:14:36|In the year 497 BC, Confucius, Nan Zi, and Ji Sunsi were discussing...
1:14:36|1:14:44|[Confucius] left the state of Lu and embarked on a tumultuous journey to visit various states. The road ahead was long, filled with both laughter and tears. During this time,
1:14:44|1:14:56|His thoughts spread to various countries, his disciples passed them on to their disciples, recording the words, actions, and thoughts of [Confucius] and his disciples, and compiling them into "The Analects", which is revered as a classic of Confucianism.
1:14:56|1:15:4|[Confucius] himself is the great sage and teacher. At this moment,
1:15:4|1:15:12|[Confucius] and his disciples waited for the envoy from the State of Wei. Upon meeting the envoy, they all respectfully bowed in greeting.
1:18:9|1:18:19|At this moment, [Nan Zi] is combing the hair for Duke Wei Ling.
1:18:45|1:18:51|Duke Ling of Wei tilted his head, looking indifferent,
1:19:4|1:19:36|6th Duke Ling of Wei answered with a smile and then playfully pounced on [Nan Zi]. [Nan Zi] maintained an elegant smile with a hint of golden light in her eyes. The next day, [Confucius] walked across an arched bridge under the guidance of a female official, leading to the palace of Lady Wei, [Nan Zi]. [Confucius] furrowed his brows as he observed the surroundings, then followed the steps of the female official into the inner hall. Inside the hall, several maids knelt down, with a red carpet laid in the center. The female official stopped and gestured for [Confucius] to take a seat.
1:19:43|1:19:53|The female official finished speaking, respectfully bowed to [Confucius], and left with all the palace maids. [Confucius] also returned the gesture, and soon the grand hall was empty.
1:19:53|1:20:15|[Confucius] knew well that this lady of the court was not easy to deal with. The political power of the Qi state was already in the hands of this woman. He sat still on the mat, observing that [Nan Zi]'s palace was not as extravagant as people had described. On the contrary, it exuded a sense of simplicity. A bronze water clock stood at the side of the hall, with water drops falling rhythmically from a long narrow copper tube.
1:20:15|1:20:33|Dipping into the bronze basin below, [Confucius] quietly feels the dripping water, suddenly hearing a crisp bell sound. The main character arrives, [Nan Zi] draped in a dark blue robe, wearing wooden clogs ten centimeters high. Through the thin veil on the side of the hall, she quietly sizes up this renowned yet underappreciated talent.
1:20:33|1:20:48|[Confucius] did not look around because of the sound he heard. [Nan Zi] had already made a preliminary judgment about [Confucius], but she continued to walk forward unhurriedly, regardless of any movements she made on the side of the hall. [Confucius] remained silent with his eyes downcast.
1:20:48|1:20:55|[Nan Zi] stopped in her tracks, carefully sizing up [Confucius] before stepping onto the stairs. She then took her place at the main seat.
1:20:55|1:21:10|Looking through the bamboo curtain at [Confucius], [Confucius] showed no bias towards [Nan Zi], bowing deeply.
1:21:15|1:21:37|Confucius obeyed the order to stand up, but still kept his head down without looking at Nan Zi. Seeing this, Nan Zi lifted the pearl curtain, revealing her head adorned with intricate golden accessories and her hair decorated with fine Hu Lan pearls. As she walked, she lightly waved the folding fan in her hand, not hiding her admiration and curiosity in her eyes. Confucius kept his head down, not lifting his eyes even when Nan Zi walked right in front of him.
1:21:48|1:22:11|Confucius turned his eyes unnaturally, Nan Zi seemed to understand what Confucius was thinking, then walked around Confucius with a fan in hand. Confucius remained silent with lowered brows, sitting still, allowing Nan Zi to scrutinize him. Nan Zi approached Confucius, suddenly squatting down, tilting his head to look at him, with a hint of playfulness and cunning in his eyes.
1:23:15|1:23:27|[Nan Zi] stared at [Confucius] for a while, finally withdrawing the playful and teasing look in her eyes. She took a step back, with a hint of curiosity in her expression.
1:24:9|1:24:35|[Nan Zi] looked at [Confucius] with disbelief, while [Confucius] looked back at her openly, allowing her to scrutinize him. [Nan Zi] could not hide her inner longing, unconsciously moving closer to [Confucius]. [Confucius] remained silent, tilting his head to observe the water droplets falling from the bronze pipe. The smile on [Nan Zi]'s face gradually faded, her initial anticipation turning into a desperate plea.
1:24:46|1:25:9|[Confucius] turned his face away, not wanting to look at [Nan Zi]'s expression. Upon hearing these words, [Nan Zi]'s expression changed from pleading to shock, then to moved. Few and far between are those who truly understand her. Over the years, she has not cared much about how others perceive her, but little did she expect that this acquaintance of a literati could see through her heart with just a few words.
1:25:17|1:25:42|Confucius couldn't help but look at Nan Zi after hearing these words. He gained a new understanding of this young lady of the lord. Nan Zi respectfully knelt down in front of Confucius, solemnly bowed to him, setting aside the identity of lord and subject. This bow was to honor Confucius as a great scholar, as a mentor, as a confidant. Confucius almost shed tears, also kneeling down and bowing to Nan Zi.
1:25:42|1:25:51|The two of them knelt facing each other, without any ulterior motives or worldly concerns, simply expressing their gratitude for finding a true confidant.
1:25:51|1:25:55|After that, [Confucius] stayed in the state of Wei for a long time, teaching and spreading his teachings.
1:25:56|1:26:17|On that day, [Confucius] rode in a carriage with Zilu, walking by the city gate of the State of Wei. [Confucius] furrowed his brows for a long time before turning to Zilu and saying, Zilu nodded thoughtfully.
1:26:21|1:26:45|Time was of the essence. [Confucius] quickly set out with his students to leave the state of Wei. Meanwhile, a carriage was speeding ahead with [Nan Zi] cloaked inside, deep in thought. At that time, Duke Ling of Wei had already passed away, and the throne had changed hands multiple times before falling into the hands of Crown Prince Kuai. As the carriage passed through the dense forest, hidden crossbows were already lying in wait among the trees.
1:26:45|1:27:9|The crossbow arrow aimed at the carriage suddenly shot out, piercing through the carriage window and directly into the chest of [Nan Zi]. [Nan Zi] lowered his head in pain, looking at the arrow in his chest without any surprise. At this moment, the scene of his first meeting with [Confucius] unexpectedly flashed in his mind. Thinking of this, [Nan Zi] managed to suppress the pain in his body and revealed a nostalgic smile.
1:27:9|1:27:19|[Confucius] looked at [Nan Zi] with a pure and sincere gaze, without any hint of desire. At that time, they only discussed academic topics, unrelated to personal matters or politics, and they were quite happy.
1:27:19|1:27:26|[Nan Zi] weakly leaned against the carriage, while [Confucius] once again recalled the evaluation [Nan Zi] had given him.
1:27:35|1:28:0|[Confucius] drove his carriage towards the next country. Over the years, he passed through Cao, Song, Zheng, and finally Chen, leaving his mark in many places. They traversed mountains and rivers, walked along vast lakes, narrow paths, and even crossed mountains to accompany shepherds. They crossed barren mountains and arrived at a lush green grassland.
1:28:0|1:28:8|The river here is gurgling, and the road is easy to walk on. Whatever [Confucius] encounters on the way, it cannot stop his progress.
1:28:8|1:28:17|Finally, they arrived at a forest on the outskirts of the State of Song and stopped to rest.
1:29:30|1:29:43|The Grand Marshal Huan Kui of the State of Song did not welcome the arrival of [Confucius]. In order to drive away [Confucius] and his group, they even cut down the tree that [Confucius] used for shade. With no other choice, they left the State of Song and arrived in the State of Zheng.
1:30:17|1:30:44|[Confucius] flipped through the bamboo slips and looked at Yan Hui. In the late Spring and Autumn period, the situation was not peaceful. The control of the Zhou dynasty over the various vassal states was very weak, and there were frequent conflicts among the states, with continuous wars and chaos. At this time, there was widespread misery and the people were barely surviving.
1:30:44|1:31:1|In 484 BC, the Qi army invaded Lu, and the flames of war reached the capital city of Lu, Qufu. Soldiers stood guard on the city walls day after day, while [Ji Sunsi] had already become an old man with white hair.
1:31:6|1:31:12|At this moment, [Ji Sunsi] stood on the city tower, gesturing for the soldiers to retreat, as it was already late at night.
1:32:20|1:32:32|[Ji Sunsi] pondered for a moment and nodded. At this time, [Confucius] was still sleeping on the couch when suddenly a commotion was heard.
1:32:39|1:32:59|The people of Chen country were fleeing inside the city with their luggage, while [Confucius], surrounded by a thousand disciples, pushed forward desperately through the chaotic crowd. The scene was too chaotic, and before long, [Confucius] and his disciples were scattered by the crowd. Zigong and others kept calling out and looking around, but they could no longer find [Confucius].
1:32:59|1:33:7|Zigong was pushed out of the city gate with the crowd, then pushed back when he didn't see Confucius.
1:33:8|1:33:23|As the storm approached, [Confucius] and others took shelter under a thatched hut. The steward of the Ji family appeared desperate and pleading.
1:34:3|1:34:7|Reluctantly laughing a few times with his companions, he walked over to [Confucius].
1:34:17|1:34:40|Confucius, with a look of bitterness on his face, pondered for a long time before looking at Yan Hui. At this moment, he had suppressed his grief and anger. He leaned on his cane, trembling as he stood up, patting Yan Hui's shoulder. Confucius turned around, looking at his disciples with a determined expression.
1:34:56|1:35:20|Looking at the determined expression of Ran Qiu in front of him, [Confucius] felt extremely relieved. He held back his tears, and finally looked forward with hope. Lu State was his hometown, and he always wanted to go back. As the two states of Qi and Lu were about to go to war as scheduled, the plains outside the city of Lu were already filled with the troops of Qi, while the soldiers of Lu State were ready and waiting. When the time was right, Ran Qiu drew his sword and pointed it straight up into the sky.
1:35:22|1:35:46|The soldiers in the first two rows immediately bent down, pulled up the ropes buried in the ground, and the wooden stakes with sharp spikes rose up, pointing directly at the Qi army. Taking advantage of the chaos among the Qi army, Ran Qiu once again ordered the Lu army's crossbows to shoot at the Qi army like rain. [Ji Sunsi] stood on the city wall and could see clearly. He raised the corners of his mouth, unable to hide his satisfaction and pride. After the war ended, he could not contain the joy in his heart, and left with Ran Qiu.
1:35:46|1:35:54|Ran Qiu rushed into the room of [Ji Sunsi], who had been bedridden for many days. Ran Qiu approached the sickbed and respectfully bowed.
1:36:40|1:36:46|[Ji Sunsi] showed a hesitant expression on his sickly face,
1:37:0|1:37:11|Upon hearing this answer, Ran Qiu was somewhat disappointed. At this moment, [Confucius] was traveling with his disciples in an area of green mountains and clear waters, which happened to be the border between the states of Chen and Cai.
1:37:31|1:37:40|The group found a two-story wooden thatched house to stay in, which was empty. They began to search for useful supplies on their own.
1:37:43|1:37:51|Yan Hui spread the map on a hard wooden board,
1:38:16|1:38:35|Zigao carried his backpack and hurried to catch up with Zilu's footsteps. Many people in the thatched house leaned their heads together to rest, only [Confucius] sat in the center of the wooden house, playing the zither absentmindedly.
1:38:58|1:39:15|Yan Hui answered for Zeng Can while looking worriedly at Confucius, who was playing the zither. Confucius was wrapped in tattered hemp cloth, his fingers rough and calloused. He had transformed from a spirited youth to an elderly man, but even with his aged appearance and political setbacks,
1:39:15|1:39:22|With a fervent patriotism and dedication to the people, [Confucius] continued to play tirelessly. During the night, [Nan Zi]...
1:39:22|1:39:33|Disciples gathered around [Confucius], lighting a bonfire to keep him warm. They huddled together, not daring to disturb [Confucius]. The long period of wandering had left everyone with different expressions.
1:39:33|1:39:46|A young man held onto [Zilu]'s arm, watching [Confucius] play the zither earnestly. Some people were curled up in a corner alone, looking confused and sad, while [Yan Hui] stirred the fire, boiling the last pot of soup.
1:39:55|1:39:59|Upon finishing speaking, [Yan Hui] squatted in front of [Confucius] holding a black ceramic bowl.
1:40:8|1:40:20|[Confucius] stared at the pottery bowl for a long time before taking it from [Yan Hui]'s hands. He held the bowl of horse meat soup in front of his eyes, greedily looking at it, and then intoxicatedly sniffed it several times.
1:40:21|1:40:45|[Zilu] lay on the ground retching for several days before finally mustering the strength to sit up. [Confucius]'s hands trembled slightly as he looked at [Zilu] with concern. Knowing his heart, [Yan Hui] quickly came over to help [Confucius] up and walked towards [Zilu]. [Confucius] was seen shakily holding the only bowl of horse meat soup, squatting in front of [Zilu] with a comforting smile on his face.
1:40:54|1:41:19|Confucius understood the temperament of this disciple. He would rather starve than cheat himself even a little bit. Seeing them suffer so much for him, Confucius couldn't help but feel sorrowful. In the end, he brought the horse meat soup to his mouth and took a small sip. The disciples beside him eagerly watched the soup in Confucius's hand. Everyone was starving, but still humble and polite. After finishing the soup, trembling, Confucius handed the bowl to Zi Lu.
1:41:24|1:41:45|[Zilu]'s tears had already streaked down his cheeks. He forced himself to lift his head and took a small sip of the meat soup at the edge of the bowl. The comfort the soup brought to [Zilu]'s spirit was far more important than filling his stomach. With tears in his eyes and trembling lips, [Confucius] smiled lovingly at [Zilu] and looked around at the disciples gathered around him.
1:41:45|1:41:54|[Yan Hui] took the bowl and did not drink it himself, but passed it to the companions in front of him.
1:41:56|1:42:18|[Confucius] returned to his seat, playing the zither. The young disciples took the bowl from their elder brother's hands, sipped carefully, and then passed it on to the next person. Despite their hunger, there was no fighting over the food. After sharing the last bit of food, everyone danced and sang along with [Confucius]'s music, joyfully jumping around.
1:42:18|1:42:28|Even Confucius himself would occasionally participate in it. Hunger, war, political frustration, and failed teaching did not break the will of Confucius and his disciples.
1:42:28|1:42:37|However, [Confucius] was already at the end of his strength at this moment. After plucking the last string of the zither, he finally collapsed due to exhaustion.
1:42:37|1:42:44|After an unknown period of time, Confucius finally woke up.
1:42:45|1:42:52|[Confucius] weakly opened his eyes and looked confusedly at the group of disciples surrounding him.
1:42:59|1:43:9|Facing Zilu's concern, [Confucius] didn't have time to respond. He took a sip of porridge first to relax his body.
1:43:36|1:43:56|Yan Zhuo was seen carrying a lamb on his shoulder into the thatched cottage. After bowing to Confucius, he excitedly knelt in front of Confucius. Confucius frowned and remained silent. Zilu quickly stood up and changed the subject.
1:44:2|1:44:10|Zilu greeted his companions while preparing to boil water and slaughter sheep. During this time, Confucius had ample rest, and in the end Zilu still chose to enter official service.
1:44:50|1:45:6|Confucius looked at Zilu, who knelt before him with determination. He handed his cane to Yan Hui, then personally helped Zilu up and carefully adjusted Yan Hui's hair bun.
1:45:26|1:45:50|Zilu's mouth kept twitching, unable to look directly into the eyes of [Confucius]. [Confucius] hesitated to turn away, then looked at the young Qisigong, who pouted and hugged [Confucius]'s thigh tightly.
1:45:56|1:46:20|Zilu wiped away his tears, helped up Qisigong who was kneeling on the ground, and walked towards the carriage without looking back. With a simple carriage and basic luggage, Zilu set off on his journey. Confucius's mood was as gloomy as the weather at that moment, with dark clouds covering the sky. He leaned on his cane and unsteadily climbed a hill, watching the carriage in the distance as it departed. While it was good that his disciple was appreciated, Zilu's impulsive nature was a concern for Confucius.
1:46:20|1:46:27|In the end, Confucius found it hard to settle down, and soon he and the other disciples continued on their journey to a foreign land.
1:46:27|1:46:48|It was winter, with thick fog all around. They had to wrap the horse hooves with burlap and use the frozen river as their path. They struggled to move the carriage forward, as the icy surface was covered with a thin layer of slippery snow. They had to tread carefully in the footsteps of the person in front of them, not realizing that a barely noticeable crack had appeared in the ice beneath their feet.
1:46:48|1:47:4|Confucius and Nan Zi sat in an open carriage, their beards and eyelashes already covered in frost. Ji Sunsi sat in another carriage, behind him piled high with scrolls, the culmination of their years of hard work. Every now and then, Ji Sunsi would glance back.
1:47:4|1:47:10|To confirm the bamboo slips are intact, [Yan Hui]'s carriage left a mark on the ice as it passed by, and when the following carriage came,
1:47:10|1:47:18|Also walking over the same imprint, the ice made a faint cracking sound, only [Confucius] looked up in confusion.
1:47:27|1:47:48|Zigong desperately whipped the reins to drive the carriage forward, while the disciples on foot also quickened their pace, but they still couldn't catch up with the speed of the ice cracks. Suddenly, a huge hole appeared under [Yan Hui]'s feet. Caught off guard, he fell straight down. The carriage overturned next to the ice hole, and the bamboo slips on the carriage fell into the river. The other disciples, realizing this,
1:47:48|1:48:3|Immediately turning around and rushing towards the ice cave, but only a few bamboo slips were floating on the ice, with no trace of [Yan Hui] in sight. Trapped in the river, [Yan Hui] couldn't care about saving himself at all. He shuttled back and forth in the bone-chilling river water, sending the fallen bamboo slips back to the surface.
1:48:3|1:48:20|While [Confucius] wept bitterly with the help of his disciples, a pair of hands emerged from the water holding several scrolls, which were then forcefully pushed towards the surrounding companions by him.
1:48:30|1:48:57|[Yan Hui] paid no attention to the ropes thrown around him, diving into the water again. By this time, the letter had already sunk to the bottom of the river, and [Yan Hui] could only dive deeper each time. He repeatedly retrieved the letter from the water, while his companions wailed and begged him to grab the rope from the edge of the ice pit, but he ignored them. [Confucius] lay on the ground crying hoarsely, only saved from falling into the water by his disciples holding him back.
1:48:57|1:49:19|Companions wept bitterly as they sorted through the letters sent by [Yan Hui], continuing to throw ropes into the water. The piercing cold eventually left [Yan Hui]'s life at the bottom of the lake. Until his last breath, he tightly held onto those letters, never letting go. [Yan Hui], styled Ziyuan, was honored as "Fu Sheng" [Yan Zi] in the capital of the State of Lu.
1:49:19|1:49:32|In the late Spring and Autumn period, a prominent thinker and Confucian master from the State of Lu, the leader of the [Seventy-two Disciples of Confucius], began studying under [Confucius] at the age of thirteen and remained his devoted student for life, becoming [Confucius]'s most favored disciple.
1:49:32|1:49:53|[Yan Hui] was quickly rescued by his companions and taken to a nearby farmer's house. After a long time, a disciple walked out of the house, shaking his head at the surrounding companions. Inside the house, [Confucius] stared blankly, refusing to let go of the stiff body of [Yan Hui]. In his eyes, the spirited young man seemed to appear again.
1:49:53|1:49:59|That day he raised his wine glass, smiled and modestly let others go first before finishing it in one gulp.
1:49:59|1:50:15|Although frowning at the spicy taste, he still had a smile on his face. Yan Hui was known for his virtuous conduct, and now, with the passing of Yan Hui, it dealt a huge blow to [Confucius].
1:50:40|1:51:10|Zigong handed the porridge to [Confucius], who kept his eyes fixed ahead, mechanically waving his hand. Zigong and another disciple could only bow respectfully and leave the room with a sense of helplessness. They knew that nothing they said at this moment would make a difference. The Master had to digest this matter on his own. When the room was empty, [Confucius] could no longer hold back his emotions. The sunlight shone through the hole in the roof of the thatched hut.
1:51:10|1:51:13|But no matter how hard he tried, it just couldn't get through to [Confucius].
1:51:13|1:51:18|At this moment, [Ji Sunsi] is already an elderly man in his twilight years, relying on others to carry him forward.
1:51:41|1:51:45|[Ji Sunsi] took out a pure white jade ring and stuffed it into Ji Sunfei's hand.
1:51:55|1:52:17|[Confucius] looked at Qi Sigong with concern, his expression frozen as if he saw Zilu being bravely killed in the final battle, with a sword striking his head.
1:52:35|1:52:50|In the decisive battle, Zilu was outnumbered and stabbed through by the soldiers of the State of Jin from behind. Despite this, he fought with all his might and managed to kill one person before falling to the ground. Zilu struggled to kneel upright.
1:52:55|1:53:12|As he was dying, Zilu did not forget the teachings of Master. Trembling, he put on his helmet. A group of soldiers from the State of Jin rushed forward, mercilessly thrusting their spears into Zilu's back. A mouthful of hot blood sprayed from Zilu's mouth, and then he fell weakly to the ground.
1:53:14|1:53:38|[Confucius] had tears welling up in his eyes, trembling lips, and a deep sorrow in his eyes that was about to overflow. After a long time, [Confucius] walked out of the room with a cane, and the others also knew about Zilu's ordeal. They all knelt on both sides, their faces filled with indescribable pain and indignation.
1:53:40|1:53:52|[Confucius] looked ahead with a bitter smile, the snow-covered peaks in front of him, the sunlight piercing through the dark clouds and shining on the mountaintop, bringing a glimmer of hope to [Confucius]'s heart.
1:53:52|1:54:5|After a long time, the disciples of Confucius were preparing to embark on a journey. Unexpectedly, a carriage outside the house caught everyone's attention. The person who came was sent by Ji Sunsi, specifically to invite Confucius back to the country on behalf of Ji Sunfei.
1:54:5|1:54:10|[Ji Sunsi] squinted for a while before finally noticing [Confucius] sitting in the room.
1:54:10|1:54:26|Confucius glanced expressionlessly at Ji Sunsi before continuing to wipe the bamboo slips in his hand. Ji Sunsi walked up to Confucius with a black lacquered wooden box and placed the jade ring inside on his desk.
1:54:29|1:54:52|[Ji Sunsi] knelt in front of [Confucius] with a look of regret and pleading on his face. Suddenly, another person squeezed into the room and knelt beside [Ji Sunsi]. [Confucius] looked up, and his expression finally changed slightly upon seeing Ran Qiu.
1:54:56|1:55:5|[Ji Sunsi]'s cough made Ran Qiu suppress his smile.
1:55:23|1:55:35|[Confucius] picked up the jade ring in front of him and gently rubbed it. Then he held the jade ring up to his eyes, carefully examining it in the sunlight streaming in from the roof.
1:55:35|1:55:59|[Ji Sunfei] and Ran Qiu did not know what [Confucius] was thinking. They knelt motionless on the ground. After some time, [Confucius] turned his head, glanced at [Ji Sunfei], and then slowly stood up to signal him to do the same. Ran Qiu and [Ji Sunfei] exchanged a glance before hesitantly standing up. Ran Qiu, looking at [Confucius]'s uncertain expression, stepped forward with concern.
1:55:59|1:56:22|Confucius paid no attention to Ran Qiu's hopeful expression. He patiently paced around the room with his head down. Finally, he walked to the front of the disciples who were watching at the door. Standing in front of the disciples, he turned to Ji Sunsi and said:
1:56:33|1:56:42|Confucius's disciples all showed a look of disbelief.
1:56:50|1:57:2|The weather at this moment cleared up just like their mood, the dying [Ji Sunsi] stubbornly demanded to be carried to the edge of the city wall, waiting for the return of [Confucius].
1:57:5|1:57:18|[Ji Sunsi] looked into the distance after hearing these words, every movement requiring great effort. His aged face carried endless anticipation and regret.
1:57:22|1:57:38|After experiencing so much, [Ji Sunsi] finally understood the significance of [Confucius] to the state of Lu. It wasn't until his old age that he was willing to set aside his pride and ask [Confucius] to return to Lu. With his head drooping lower and lower in the cold wind, [Ji Sunsi] finally collapsed weakly.
1:57:38|1:57:43|At dusk, a crowd gathered outside the capital of the State of Lu. When they saw the carriage, [Confucius], [Nan Zi], and [Ji Sunsi] stepped out.
1:57:43|1:57:52|The crowd all knelt down on the ground, respectfully welcoming the arrival. In the year 484 BC, [Confucius] ended more than a decade of wandering.
1:57:52|1:58:0|Finally back to their hometown, the State of Lu. Zi Gong, Qi Sigong, and others, with joyful expressions on their faces like children,
1:58:6|1:58:20|A footstool was placed on the side of the carriage, and a pair of feet in tattered cloth shoes trembled as they stepped up. Although every movement of his required support from the cane in his hand, it did not affect the continuity of his actions.
1:58:20|1:58:27|[Confucius], dressed in tattered gray sackcloth, leaned on a cane and hunched his body as he walked forward step by step.
1:58:27|1:58:34|After fourteen years away from home, he had long lost his former glory. What time had brought him, besides endless knowledge, was...
1:58:34|1:58:43|Only this broken body remains. Then [Confucius] stood at the city gate for a long time, suddenly letting go of the crutch in his hand.
1:58:43|1:58:55|He clasped his hands in front of his forehead, then moved them to his chest, and finally knelt down on the ground, devoutly kowtowing towards the city gate. The people around him were all moved, quietly watching his every move.
1:58:55|1:59:13|[Confucius] trembled his lips, unable to say a word, looking at his familiar hometown with mixed feelings. He knelt on the ground for a long time without getting up, as if pouring all his emotions into this one kneel. When [Confucius] raised his head again, tears had already filled his eyes.
1:59:26|1:59:56|Confucius was filled with tears, unable to control his emotions. While the world knew of Confucius's profound knowledge and high moral standards, they forgot that at this moment, he was just a homesick man. Finally, Confucius was able to return to his hometown as he wished. With his white hair, Confucius sat by the study, a young student holding bamboo slips looked at him with confusion. Confucius seemed lost in thought, and it took him a while to turn and smile at the young student.
1:59:58|2:0:16|He pondered for a moment, then pointed to the scrolls not far away, signaling the young servant. The servant followed [Confucius]'s gesture and called his companions to move the neatly wrapped scrolls outside.
2:0:16|2:0:23|"The Spring and Autumn Annals" was revised by [Confucius] and is the first chronological history book in China.
2:0:23|2:0:29|The language used for recording events is extremely concise, yet almost every sentence carries implicit praise or criticism.
