0:0:33|0:0:43|Accompanied by lively music, a cool-looking young man in stylish attire, wearing a helmet, races on a motorcycle along winding mountain roads, the roaring speed accelerating his excited heartbeat.
0:0:43|0:0:51|The young man, with a proud and arrogant demeanor, revved the motorcycle engine and with a twist of the throttle, leaving all scenery behind him in an instant, as if turning them into mere clouds.
0:0:54|0:1:4|The speed of Little Fire brought a gust of cool wind, blowing his screams behind him, and this wind also blew out the title of the film, "Waiting for You to Chase Me".
0:1:4|0:1:10|The screams of Little Fire still echoed in the mountains, as if the deep valleys were responding to him.
0:1:10|0:1:20|Suddenly, an off-road vehicle blocked Xiao Huo's path. The driver of the off-road vehicle, seeing the situation, slammed on the brakes. The people in the car struggled to get out, and after stopping the car, everyone in the off-road vehicle got out.
0:1:23|0:1:26|After bidding farewell to the group in the off-road vehicle, the young man arrived at the solitary shack.
0:1:57|0:2:1|[Jia Fupi] directly weakens the ability of military sticks to resist diseases, seriously affecting the normal growth of military silk.
0:2:7|0:2:11|The neat and uniform drumbeats lead us to the square at the foot of the mountain.
0:2:11|0:2:13|It turns out that a group of aunties were dancing square dance.
0:2:13|0:2:18|On the other side of the square, there is a group of three people who have just come down the mountain in an off-road vehicle.
0:2:18|0:2:25|The driver held up a sign that read, "Warmly welcome the technology envoy to our village for guidance work."
0:2:25|0:2:27|After waiting for a long time, [Yao Darong] received a phone call.
0:2:57|0:3:7|[Liang Yan] looked into the distance helplessly, and a BMW car drove up. So [Liang Yan] led the villagers to run to the village entrance to welcome it.
0:4:16|0:4:21|The young man was stunned to realize that the beauty he had met on the mountain earlier was actually the village chief.
0:4:52|0:4:54|Once the matter was hidden in the ingredients, it was revealed after being taken out of the bag.
0:5:21|0:5:23|He is [Yao Daxiong], my nephew.
0:5:40|0:5:42|This is our village party secretary [Yao Darong].
0:5:52|0:5:58|The next day, [Liang Yan] arrived at the village committee office building after dressing up carefully.
0:6:20|0:6:24|[Liang Yan] quietly walked into [Yuan Mengyao]'s office, walked up to [Yuan Mengyao]'s desk, and lightly tapped on the desk.
0:7:15|0:7:17|The two of them walked up the mountain along the handrail.
0:7:25|0:7:28|The stream trickled through the mountains, and the two did not notice the figure of [Yao Daxiong].
0:7:32|0:7:37|After Liang Yan called out twice, the two, suddenly heard a faint singing from a distance, and were momentarily stunned.
0:7:37|0:7:42|He patted [Yuan Mengyao] on the shoulder, and the two quickly searched for the source of the sound.
0:7:42|0:7:48|On the other side, [Liu Fang] was sitting on a small slope in the woods, quietly strumming her guitar and singing, lost in her own world.
0:7:55|0:8:0|All things in the world are as melodious as a song, as if the flowers, plants, and trees are all softly echoing with him.
0:8:0|0:8:7|He quietly felt the breath of nature, [Yuan Mengyao] and [Liang Yan] found [Yao Daxiong] following the singing, slowly approaching him from behind.
0:8:7|0:8:15|Her artistic appearance now is a stark contrast to her previous idle appearance in the solitary shed, leaving both of them feeling quite shocked.
0:8:15|0:8:20|[Yuan Mengyao] remained silent, while [Liang Yan] excitedly shook [Yuan Mengyao] and said.
0:8:26|0:8:30|[Yuan Mengyao] acted decisively, and the drenched [Yao Daxiong] shouted.
0:8:37|0:8:39|Playing the piano, drinking coffee.
0:9:20|0:9:26|[Liang Yan] left gracefully, and after watching her walk away, [Liang Yan] shyly handed the key to [Yao Daxiong].
0:9:26|0:9:30|Yao Daxiong took the key and stared at Liang Yan without blinking, asking.
0:10:46|0:10:49|In the morning, [Yuan Mengyao] came to bring food to [Yao Daxiong].
0:11:7|0:11:13|The door was not opened yet, [Yao Darong] angrily knocked on the door, and [Yao Daxiong] happened to open it, causing [Yao Darong] to crash heavily into the wall.
0:11:13|0:11:17|[Yuan Mengyao] put down the food and was stunned by the magazine cover on the table, then [Yao Daxiong] snatched the magazine.
0:11:43|0:11:45|Yao Daxiong turned around and walked away disdainfully.
0:11:45|0:11:51|[Yuan Mengyao] gave [Liang Yan] a white look, then returned to the office to help Daxiong massage his arms.
0:12:5|0:12:6|[Yuan Mengyao] slowly walked to her seat and sat down.
0:12:46|0:12:53|She wants to develop a new type of solidification technology. If successful, it can not only increase production capacity but also be environmentally friendly.
0:13:5|0:13:14|Daxiong pondered for a moment, then suddenly slapped his thigh and exclaimed, "[Yuan Mengyao]!"
0:13:14|0:13:18|At this moment, [Liang Yan] is cultivating mushrooms in the place where she plays the guitar in the morning.
0:13:18|0:13:23|Daxiong arrived and saw [Liang Yan] holding several reagents for an experiment, he approached grumbling and asked.
0:13:27|0:13:28|[Liang Yan] stood up and walked to the spot pointed out by Daxiong, then bowed respectfully.
0:14:1|0:14:7|God brought me here, and Daxiong hurriedly drove away, approaching his [Liang Yan].
0:15:23|0:15:24|[Yuan Mengyao] and her group immediately head up the mountain after dining with the entrepreneur.
0:16:9|0:16:17|The village uncle angrily walked to where Yuan Mengyao was conducting experiments, still with coffee mushrooms.
0:16:33|0:16:37|[Liu Fang] was criticized by the village party secretary to the point where she couldn't say a word, and she returned to her room dejectedly with her head down.
0:16:37|0:16:42|The stream flows continuously down the mountain, [Yuan Mengyao] walks out of the office with a disfigured face.
0:16:42|0:16:45|After a moment of contemplation, he walked decisively towards [Liu Fang]'s room.
0:16:45|0:16:50|[Liang Yan] quietly watched from the side as [Yuan Mengyao] entered [Liu Fang]'s room to comfort her.
0:19:38|0:19:45|Liu Fang recalls the scene of seeing Yuan Mengyao's cover photo for the first time in the magazine store.
0:19:55|0:20:1|[Liang Yan] eavesdropped outside [Liu Fang]'s room and heard [Liu Fang]'s confession to [Yuan Mengyao], looking disappointed.
0:20:35|0:20:45|[Yuan Mengyao] smiled at [Liu Fang] with her back turned, then left, leaving [Liu Fang] full of anticipation.
0:20:45|0:20:52|Liang Yan was leaning against the door with her eyes downcast, while Yuan Mengyao was extremely excited, bouncing and walking on the bridge, thinking about Liu Fang's confession.
0:23:42|0:23:47|The director's wife brought the meal to the table, and in the evening, the square at the foot of the mountain was bustling.
0:23:47|0:23:53|Accompanied by cheerful music, [Liang Yan] is dancing in the middle of a square dance group, shining brightly.
0:23:53|0:23:58|[Liu Fang] quietly sneaked into the back row of the group, taking photos of the elderly people dancing square dance.
0:23:58|0:24:1|She slowly approached [Liang Yan], who also noticed her.
0:24:3|0:24:10|[Liu Fang] generously danced with [Liang Yan], then playfully imitated [Liang Yan] and joined in the square dance.
0:24:10|0:24:15|She barely managed to keep up with the action, and at this moment on the mountain, [Yuan Mengyao] knocked on the door of the Daxiong family.
0:24:34|0:24:37|Yao Daxiong regretfully slapped himself.
0:25:11|0:25:14|[Yuan Mengyao] nonchalantly lowered her head to eat fruit, while Daxiong froze and said.
0:26:3|0:26:16|The next morning, the study group was getting ready to leave, but Daxiong kept nagging his younger brother, urging him with his eyes.
0:26:47|0:27:1|[Liu Fang] conducted on-site investigation alone in the mountains. She carried a agricultural produce testing device and a pole, walked through the deep mountains, arrived at the stream, took some stream water and put it into a test tube. Then she added some reagents in a measured amount, and carefully placed the sampling tube.
0:27:1|0:27:13|Continuing on, [Yuan Mengyao] arrived at another experimental site, carefully examining the mushrooms on the mountain wall. After collecting samples, she sat by the rushing stream to sketch, leisurely capturing the scenery of the mountains and waters in front of her.
0:27:14|0:27:21|On the side of the hanging building, [Yao Daxiong]'s mother is matchmaking with a young girl.
0:28:14|0:28:26|[Yao Daxiong]'s mother squinted her eyes, with a cold expression, but Liu Fang was completely unaware. She looked satisfied as she gazed at her landscape painting, and with great interest, she added a few strokes to draw the face of [Yuan Mengyao].
0:29:46|0:29:48|[Yuan Mengyao] approached Liu Fang and helped her blow on her eyes.
0:29:48|0:29:53|Yao Daxiong's younger brother took out his phone and captured this scene.
0:29:53|0:29:58|In the eyes of Yao Daxiong's younger brother, the two's actions were overly intimate, as if Yuan Mengyao took the initiative to kiss Liu Fang's cheek.
0:30:13|0:30:18|[Yuan Mengyao] was half skeptical, but was amused by Liu Fang.
0:30:18|0:30:21|Yao Daxiong's little brother ran away, while Yao Daxiong is still in training.
0:30:21|0:30:28|There are over a thousand known species of edible mushrooms, with dozens of them successfully cultivated by humans.
0:30:36|0:30:38|[Yao Daxiong] hurriedly ran to the door to answer his little brother's phone call.
0:31:0|0:31:9|The small bridge in the mountain village shimmered with the sunlight, and the forest on the mountain looked like it had a canopy, with branches and leaves spreading out.
0:31:25|0:31:38|Liu Fang seemed to be enveloped in a thin mist, outlining the shape of the daylight, painting the landscape in front of her, then picking up the camera and examining the soil conditions under the leaves.
0:31:38|0:31:45|Yao Daxiong hurried back to the village because of his younger brother's misunderstanding. The younger brothers were anxiously waiting under the big tree at the village entrance.
0:31:45|0:31:48|Yao Daxiong happily walked up to his younger brothers from a distance.
0:32:17|0:32:22|In the spiritual land, [Liang Yan] stood next to the failed military nun, shouting in disappointment.
0:34:12|0:34:18|[Yuan Mengyao] held Daxiong's hand and pleaded, while [Liang Yan] behind them was deeply moved.
0:34:27|0:34:31|Later, [Yuan Mengyao] arrived at the village chief's house, where the village chief poured out the remaining water in the basin.
0:35:55|0:35:58|[Yuan Mengyao] arrived at [Yao Daxiong]'s house, and [Yao Daxiong]'s mother ran downstairs to open the door.
0:36:25|0:36:32|After [Yuan Mengyao] left, [Yao Daxiong]'s mother happily called him, and his younger brother answered the phone.
0:37:3|0:37:8|Daxiong left the field, [Yuan Mengyao] was waiting for him by the roadside.
0:37:8|0:37:13|Daxiong was shopping for new clothes at the clothing store, and he put on a suit jacket, but he was still somewhat dissatisfied.
0:37:27|0:37:33|Finally, [Yao Daxiong] appeared in a dazzling suit jacket, quietly standing behind [Yuan Mengyao].
0:38:10|0:38:21|Yuan Mengyao headed towards the motorcycle that had just zoomed past, while his henchmen walked up behind Yao Daxiong and asked.
0:38:21|0:38:23|A young man flashed by on a motorcycle.
0:38:25|0:38:30|[Yuan Mengyao] took a shortcut from the other side, and the motorcycle stopped next to a girl.
0:38:30|0:38:34|The young man took off his helmet and got off the car, speaking to the girl standing under the tree.
0:38:34|0:38:36|Yuan Mengyao appears lost in thought.
0:45:29|0:45:34|[Yuan Mengyao] is embarrassed and angry, while [Yao Daxiong] is celebrating with his buddies at the restaurant.
0:46:13|0:46:21|[Yuan Mengyao] strode over angrily, scaring [Yao Daxiong] into not daring to drink. Two henchmen patted [Yao Daxiong] on the shoulder and quickly ran away.
0:46:21|0:46:23|The two fled in panic, not daring to look at [Yuan Mengyao].
0:46:23|0:46:30|[Yuan Mengyao] glared angrily at [Yao Daxiong], who was just starting to get drunk, blushing awkwardly and smiling at [Yuan Mengyao].
0:46:46|0:46:52|Daxiong, fueled by alcohol, downed another glass before continuing to speak.
0:46:52|0:46:58|Daxiong nervously pursed his lips, [Yuan Mengyao] was stunned, he didn't expect Daxiong to be so serious.
0:46:58|0:47:5|Daxiong sighed, poured himself another glass of wine, and [Yuan Mengyao] lowered her head.
0:47:42|0:47:46|After [Yuan Mengyao] got up and left, the younger brothers quietly watched [Yao Daxiong] at the door.
0:47:46|0:47:49|Daxiong drank heavily in distress, swallowing his sorrow.
0:47:49|0:47:54|In another misty area, [Liang Yan] is sketching in the mountain forest.
0:47:54|0:47:59|She is facing the woods, focusing solely on painting the scenery between the mountains on her canvas.
0:47:59|0:48:1|Yuan Mengyao, with a gift for words, exudes infinite inner peace.
0:48:1|0:48:4|Before long, Yao Daxiong also arrived in the woods.
0:48:23|0:48:32|[Liang Yan] put down the brush in her hand, glanced at Daxiong, then looked ahead. With a determined look, she picked up the drawing board, stood up, and gazed firmly at Daxiong.
0:48:42|0:48:42|Yao Daxiong confidently turns around and strides down the mountain.
0:49:3|0:49:12|[Yuan Mengyao] is in the backstage dressing room, arranging the clothes on the hangers. She has her back to the door frame and is completely unaware of Daxiong quietly approaching behind her.
0:49:12|0:49:26|Daxiong quietly entered the room, hiding behind the clothes rack next to [Yuan Mengyao], closing his eyes in prayer, rehearsing the words he wanted to say, nervously patting his chest, afraid that [Yuan Mengyao] would discover him early.
0:49:26|0:49:33|At this moment, [Yuan Mengyao] was just leaving with a piece of clothing, while [Liang Yan] walked past the clothes rack holding a stack of clothes, with their backs facing Yao Daxiong.
0:49:39|0:49:47|Daxiong knelt on one knee in front of Liang Yan behind the clothes rack.
0:50:12|0:50:21|Daxiong looked up and saw [Liang Yan]. The two of them stared at each other, both dumbfounded. Daxiong made a face of grievance, almost on the verge of tears.
0:50:21|0:50:25|[Mrs. Liu] lives in a remote area, surrounded by mountains and forests, cultivating edible fungi.
0:50:28|0:50:35|Under his meticulous research and careful cooking, the stones on the tree canopy emitted twinkling lights.
0:50:35|0:50:38|The scattered light of the stars is the result of his painstaking efforts and growth.
0:50:38|0:50:43|In an instant, Shi Yongjun rose up into the sky one by one, floating in the air like a dream.
0:51:7|0:51:12|Liu Fang turned her head in excitement, and with a glance, she stood frozen in place.
0:51:12|0:51:18|It turned out to be [Yuan Mengyao] in an elegant and pure wedding dress, walking towards him in a dreamy radiance.
0:51:18|0:51:22|She was stunned, with a happy smile on her face, and then she walked towards [Yuan Mengyao].
0:51:26|0:51:36|The two of them had clear and determined eyes, full of hope as they walked towards each other, surrounded by practical soldiers shining with light.
0:51:36|0:51:43|The shining practical military uniforms added a lot of sacred atmosphere to this scene, and the two stood solemnly.
0:51:43|0:51:49|[Yuan Mengyao] smiles gently, a slight tilt of her head leaving one spellbound.
0:51:49|0:51:53|She blushed and lowered her head under the gaze, then Liu Fang spoke.
0:51:59|0:52:3|[Yuan Mengyao] scratched Liu Fang with foxtail grass, causing Liu Fang to wake up from the dream with a sneeze.
0:52:56|0:52:59|[Yuan Mengyao] threw away the dog tail grass and stood up.
0:53:21|0:53:23|Many ancient agricultural discoveries.
0:53:46|0:53:50|And at this moment, [Yao Daxiong] is in the restaurant.
0:54:44|0:54:50|[Yuan Mengyao] was puzzled and stared at [Daxiong] upon hearing these words, lowering her arm.
0:54:50|0:54:55|[Daxiong] Two little brothers were watching on the side, and [Yuan Mengyao] had a clever idea and also paid respects to the ancestors.
0:55:14|0:55:21|Watching the resolute figure of [Yuan Mengyao] walking away, [Yao Daxiong] regretted messing up another big thing, as his younger brothers ran out.
0:55:34|0:55:44|[Yao Daxiong] crazily sprayed the secret weapon perfume given by his henchman, only to attract a charging big dog.
0:55:44|0:55:47|The big dog chased after [Yao Daxiong], frightening him into fleeing frantically through the village.
0:55:50|0:55:54|He ran swiftly under the stage, with the dog chasing after him madly.
0:55:54|0:55:59|So he ran onto the stage, with the big dog following him, causing a commotion on the stage.
0:55:59|0:56:9|In panic, he hid behind everyone and ran from the stage to the backstage loft, with the big dog still chasing after him.
0:56:9|0:56:17|He ran into the backstage and closed the door, hiding the big dog outside. When he turned around, he saw [Liang Yan], a Peking opera actress, changing costumes.
0:56:21|0:56:29|He entered the living room, empty-handed, and the women threw costumes at him. He was hit all over and couldn't see clearly around him.
0:56:40|0:56:44|Yao Daxiong looked down and found a bra hanging on his arm.
0:56:44|0:56:47|The girls then crazily attacked [Yao Daxiong].
0:56:47|0:56:50|After midnight, the girls rehearsed on the stage.
0:56:50|0:56:52|In the audience, the aunties are chatting away.
0:56:52|0:56:55|[Liu Fang] stood by taking photos of the girls, following the book.
0:57:14|0:57:26|[Liang Yan] dances confidently on the stage, rehearsing late into the night. [Liu Fang] rides a motorcycle to take her home, and the vehicle sways as it travels on the bumpy bridge surface.
0:57:26|0:57:32|Liang Yan stumbled and injured her leg due to the water brake. Liu Fang got off the car and asked.
0:57:32|0:57:36|[Liu Fang] knelt beside the injured [Liang Yan], while [Yuan Mengyao] watched from a distance.
0:57:39|0:57:44|[Yuan Mengyao] saw the two men's easy movements and quickly walked up to ask.
0:58:32|0:58:37|The next morning, [Liang Yan] carefully applied exquisite makeup in front of the mirror.
0:58:37|0:58:45|Later, she attended in her finest attire, holding a bouquet of flowers, and arrived at [Liu Fang]'s house.
0:58:45|0:58:51|[Liang Yan] walked into [Liu Fang]'s house fidgeting.
0:58:51|0:58:58|[Liang Yan] walked into the room and saw that [Liu Fang]'s bed was piled with clothes, even books and magazines were scattered around.
0:58:58|0:58:58|Liu Fang is not here.
0:59:1|0:59:14|She then puzzledly placed the bouquet on the table, and then excitedly picked up a coat on [Liu Fang]'s bed, blushing and excitedly embroidered it, then hung the coat on the hanger, humming a tune while dragging it on the ground.
0:59:14|0:59:26|[Liu Fang]'s room was quickly transformed, and she was sweating profusely after cleaning it. Taking a deep breath, she leaned the mop to the side, fanned herself with her hand, and then took out her phone from her pocket and walked into the bathroom.
0:59:28|0:59:32|The phone is placed on the table, playing cheerful music, while [Yuan Mengyao] is taking a shower in the bathroom.
0:59:49|0:59:53|He carefully cleaned his body, enjoying the warm bath.
0:59:53|0:59:57|Just then, [Liu Fang] finished the experiment and came back with the detector.
0:59:57|1:0:1|Upon entering, he heard the sound of water in the bathroom and opened the door in surprise.
1:0:1|1:0:4|Liang Yan in the bathroom turns her head just in time.
1:0:4|1:0:10|In the instant when their eyes met, Liu Fang stood still in shock, and [Liang Yan] paled, letting out a piercing scream.
1:0:10|1:0:14|Liu Fang ran away with her legs, without even closing the door, shouting as she ran.
1:0:21|1:0:29|[Yuan Mengyao] rushed into Liu Fang's room anxiously, and saw [Liang Yan] hiding in the corner with a frightened look while taking a shower. She was startled and quickly ran out of the room to question Liu Fang.
1:0:55|1:0:57|[Yao Daxiong] received a phone call at the bar.
1:1:54|1:2:0|[Yuan Mengyao] firmly closed the door, leaving Liu Fang blocked outside, feeling frustrated and unable to explain herself.
1:2:0|1:2:4|The distressed Yuan Mengyao contrasts sharply with the excited Yao Daxiong.
1:2:18|1:2:21|[Yao Darong] instantly put on a serious face, while [Yao Daxiong] smiled brightly.
1:2:21|1:2:30|Men and women were moving their bodies in the dance floor, with the music beating vigorously, but Liu Fang was in complete silence in the village party secretary's office.
1:2:30|1:2:32|Village chief leaned on the table and asked.
1:3:24|1:3:28|Village scholar left, [Liang Yan] bowed her head in repentance, then went to Mengyang's house to go to the capital to confess.
1:3:41|1:3:45|The villagers are all watching Liang Yan's jokes.
1:3:45|1:3:50|Mengyao walked out of the door, and Liang Yan saw a glimmer of hope.
1:4:22|1:4:28|[Liang Yan] chased to the roadside, but failed to catch up with Mengyao.
1:4:28|1:4:39|[Liang Yan] got sand and stones in her shoes. She took off her shoes and poured out the sand, her actions were quite comical. [Yao Daxiong] and his younger brother watched her antics from the side.
1:4:39|1:4:42|The younger brother dances to imitate [Liang Yan], and [Liang Yan]'s movements suddenly become eerie.
1:4:45|1:4:50|Daxiong, worried, went to rescue with his little brother. He accidentally hit Liang Yan's head with a stick.
1:4:50|1:4:54|[Liang Yan] let go of the electric pole she was holding onto, fell to the ground, and passed out.
1:4:55|1:5:2|Later, [Liang Yan] was taken to the hospital, admitted to a ward, with Mengyao by her side carefully taking care of her, gently feeding her water.
1:5:2|1:5:6|After taking a few sips, [Liu Fang] shook her head gently.
1:6:34|1:6:45|[Yuan Mengyao] gently feeds oranges to [Liu Fang], under the bright sun, the village and the stream merge into one, [Liu Fang] takes [Mengyao] running on the bridge.
1:6:45|1:6:48|[Liu Fang] swung her coat and shouted and jumped excitedly.
1:6:50|1:6:53|[Yuan Mengyao] ran behind, excited.
1:6:59|1:7:5|On a day of unpredictable changes, a shadow was cast over Chongshan.
1:7:57|1:8:1|[Yuan Mengyao] knelt beside [Liu Fang] with an umbrella, holding her tightly.
1:8:1|1:8:3|Yuan Mengyao and Yao Daxiong accompanied each other on a cold rainy night.
1:8:5|1:8:19|The next morning, [Liu Fang] packed up her luggage and prepared to leave the village. As she walked out, she looked back at her room with reluctance. [Yuan Mengyao], dressed in a cool and casual outfit, stood at [Liu Fang]'s doorstep, leaning against a motorcycle, waiting for her.
1:8:19|1:8:26|[Liu Fang] was engrossed in the room and didn't notice [Yuan Mengyao]. When [Yuan Mengyao] saw [Liu Fang] coming out, she spoke up and asked.
1:8:44|1:8:51|[Liang Yan] walked gently towards [Liu Fang], who avoided eye contact.
1:8:53|1:9:1|Liu Fang looked at [Yuan Mengyao], then turned away. [Yuan Mengyao] smiled and took out a bank card.
1:9:8|1:9:11|[Yuan Mengyao] pulled Liu Fang's hand and handed the bank card to her.
1:9:20|1:9:22|Liu Fang grabbed [Yuan Mengyao] who was about to leave.
1:9:22|1:9:27|In the midst of Yuan Mengyao's panic, Liu Fang pulled her into his arms and held her tightly.
1:9:27|1:9:30|After a moment of contemplation, Liu Fang whispered softly in [Yuan Mengyao]'s ear.
1:9:33|1:9:36|The embrace of the two was so beautiful.
1:9:36|1:9:53|Shortly after, Yuan Mengyao regained her previous vitality. She carried a backpack to the experimental forest, where she saw the dense trees in the distant mountains and the vibrant land in front of her. Eager and full of energy, she carefully placed the experimental box down and respectfully bowed towards the forest.
1:11:4|1:11:23|Daxiong arrived at the dam, with a box at his feet. He leaned against the railing, waiting for Fang. When Fang arrived and asked Daxiong a question, he didn't answer. Instead, he bent down, opened the box at his feet, and took out several old, worn-out items.
1:11:28|1:11:31|Recalling countless memories, he sighed as he watched and spoke.
1:12:38|1:12:51|Yao Daxiong lowered his eyes sadly and put down his arms, while Liang Yan raised her head confidently and said to him.
1:12:51|1:12:54|Daxiong stared at [Liang Yan], stood up and looked at him helplessly.
1:13:3|1:13:15|[Liang Yan] turned her head and looked into the distance. Daxiong appeared pained, but tried to maintain a strong front and calm his emotions. After much effort, he managed to squeeze out a smile towards [Liang Yan], and said in a forced calm tone.
1:13:15|1:13:29|[Liang Yan], I beg you, the pleading tone of Daxiong made [Liang Yan] feel even more painful. [Liang Yan] seemed to be sulking, turning her head away from him.
1:13:29|1:13:32|Liang Yan's eyes were originally deep rivers.
1:13:32|1:13:35|Daxiong saw the situation and his expression returned to a look of disappointment.
1:13:35|1:13:42|After adjusting his state, [Yuan Mengyao] bent down to put the items back in the box, and then, with heavy steps, he walked away.
1:13:42|1:13:47|[Liang Yan] looked at Daxiong's back as he walked away alone with a box, feeling sorry but also helpless.
1:13:48|1:13:55|[Liang Yan] leaned on the railing, looking at the river, with clear eyes but hidden emotions flickering in the depths.
1:13:55|1:14:6|She pondered alone on the dam for a long time. In the evening, [Yuan Mengyao] arrived at [Liang Yan]'s house and knocked on her door.
1:14:6|1:14:12|[Liang Yan] hesitated for a moment but still didn't open the door, her mind racing as she leaned against it.
1:14:30|1:14:36|[Yuan Mengyao] felt strange in her heart, but she didn't think much about it. She left disappointedly with a stack of documents in her arms.
1:14:36|1:14:47|Liu Fang heard the footsteps of [Yuan Mengyao] leaving, then she came to the desk and crossed out the column of mountain troops on the military package statistics form, but her heart was still unable to calm down.
1:14:47|1:14:54|Later, she tore off the statistics form, threw the process team to the ground, but [Yao Daxiong]'s earnest words echoed in her ears.
1:15:8|1:15:14|Liu Fang lifted the magazine with [Yuan Mengyao]'s photo on the cover from the table, and emotions surged in her heart for a moment.
1:15:14|1:15:18|She opened her phone, hung up the call to Yuan Mengyao, and pondered for a long time.
1:15:20|1:15:27|So he went outside to clear his mind, but his thoughts were still in a mess. As he walked, he unexpectedly arrived at the doorstep of [Yuan Mengyao]'s house.
1:15:27|1:15:33|He hesitated, even dared not to look up, but caught a glimpse of the lights in [Yuan Mengyao]'s room going out.
1:15:33|1:15:39|The dimmed lights were like the disappointed mood of Liu Fang at this moment, he sighed helplessly and then left [Yuan Mengyao]'s house.
1:15:39|1:15:41|He lingered, turning back every three steps.
1:15:46|1:15:53|The next morning, Liu Fang arrived at the forest as usual to paint. Suddenly she heard the voice of [Yuan Mengyao] and turned around in surprise.
1:16:7|1:16:17|Without a response from [Liu Fang], [Yuan Mengyao] felt a bit disappointed. She walked to the experiment site, but did not see [Liu Fang]. Looking around, she noticed the swaying hammock and the boiling coffee.
1:16:18|1:16:23|So he shifted his gaze to the tree not far away and saw Liang Yan's sketchpad.
1:16:29|1:16:34|Although feeling sad, [Yao Daxiong] still put down the lunchbox and walked away desolately.
1:16:34|1:16:42|[Liu Fang] saw the back of [Yuan Mengyao] leaving alone behind the tree, feeling guilty, but still unable to overcome the barrier in her heart, never daring to face [Yuan Mengyao].
1:16:44|1:16:51|Against the backdrop of bird chirping, a car pulled up at the village entrance, and a stylishly dressed girl with long hair stepped out of the car.
1:16:51|1:16:53|The girl walked towards the village, but she didn't recognize the way.
1:16:53|1:16:57|A villager approached, and the girl walked up to ask.
1:17:2|1:17:8|Oh, the girl arrived at [Liu Fang]'s house and looked at the shelves filled with military models, asking in surprise.
1:17:20|1:17:26|In the gentle breeze and perfect sunlight, the girl arrived at the riverside, with [Liu Fang] as her guide, introducing the village to her.
1:17:26|1:17:31|Later, [Liu Fang] took the girl to the lake and they boarded a boat, when suddenly the girl spoke up.
1:18:2|1:18:5|Liu Fang took the girl to enjoy the mountains and water, feeling very happy.
1:18:5|1:18:7|Yuan Mengyao and Yao Daxiong returned to Liu Fang's home and ate watermelon.
1:18:35|1:18:39|This is the village chief of Baishanzu, Yuan Mengyao.
1:18:39|1:18:43|Yuan Mengyao looked at the hand holding between Liu Fang and the girl, feeling flustered, and took a while to respond.
1:18:56|1:19:1|[Yuan Mengyao] turned around sadly, while Liu Fang patted the girl's thigh.
1:19:1|1:19:13|[Yuan Mengyao] turned around and, seeing the situation, left angrily.
1:19:13|1:19:16|Liu Fang gives a thumbs-up to the girl.
1:19:16|1:19:20|After a while, [Yuan Mengyao] passed by Liu Fang's room holding some documents and heard a commotion.
1:19:29|1:19:46|[Yuan Mengyao] remembered the information on the box, left angrily, and Liu Fang walked out the door with her arm around the girl.
1:19:46|1:19:51|Yuan Mengyao saw the easy actions of the two in the office and called Liu Fang back.
1:20:19|1:20:22|Mengyao turned and left in sadness, then angrily returned to the office.
1:20:22|1:20:38|[Liang Yan] stood still and couldn't say a word. She returned to the room feeling frustrated, and both of them were upset.
1:20:38|1:20:43|Suddenly, [Liang Yan] rushed out of the room and shouted at Mengyao.
1:21:1|1:21:10|The small fish pond in Sun Zhishu's home reflected the sorrowful face of [Yao Daxiong], who stared blankly at the pond without moving. Sun Zhishu, filled with worry, asked with concern.
1:21:56|1:22:1|Yao Daxiong finally revealed a genuine smile from the bottom of his heart.
1:22:36|1:22:40|Liu Fang grew a lot after listening to the teachings of the expert teacher from the Agricultural Science Institute.
1:22:58|1:23:1|The crowd bid farewell to [Liu Fang] with reluctance as they visited the construction site of the mushroom farm.
1:23:26|1:23:28|[Liu Fang] walked up to Daxiong and grabbed him.
1:23:44|1:23:48|[Liu Fang] arrived at the village party secretary's office, bringing several bags of folders.
1:23:48|1:23:51|The village chief asked.
1:24:38|1:24:45|Liu Fang bid farewell to the village scholar in a pretended carefree manner, leaving the village scholar with a deep sense of reluctance as he watched [Liu Fang] walk away.
1:24:45|1:25:5|That day, [Yuan Mengyao] passed by a clothing store in the county town. Looking through the glass window carefully, she unexpectedly saw the girl who had a fight with [Liu Fang] last time trying on a wedding dress. The man standing opposite her was not [Liu Fang], which made [Yuan Mengyao] feel puzzled.
1:25:5|1:25:6|[Yuan Mengyao] runs into the store.
1:25:15|1:25:20|[Yuan Mengyao] suddenly realized, happily thanked the girl and left.
1:25:52|1:25:58|[Yuan Mengyao] held onto the results left by [Liu Fang], listening to the village chief's words, her eyes turning red.
1:25:58|1:26:7|The village party secretary quietly left the office, [Yuan Mengyao] turned her head and saw her leaving, then she was alone in the office picking up the drawing paper left by [Liang Yan].
1:26:7|1:26:13|After opening the scroll, she found that the most prominent position on the scroll was painted by [Liu Fang] with her wearing a wedding dress.
1:26:14|1:26:22|[Yuan Mengyao] was deeply moved, tears streaming down his face as he thought of all that [Liu Fang] had done for him silently, missing [Liu Fang].
1:26:22|1:26:26|While [Liu Fang] remained unaware, he observed the tea farmers picking tea leaves in the tea garden on the mountain.
1:26:28|1:26:31|The tea plantation appears solemn, dignified, and magnificent under the sky.
1:26:31|1:26:36|Tea farmers are scattered on the mountains, diligently picking fresh tea leaves.
1:26:36|1:26:40|[Liang Yan] walks on the path, holding a camera to record, preparing to start a new experiment.
1:26:40|1:26:46|She still felt lonely, even though there were countless people in the tea garden, it was not as good as the company of [Yuan Mengyao] alone.
1:26:58|1:27:5|The call of [Yuan Mengyao] echoed in the valley, while [Liang Yan] was far away on the horizon.
1:27:5|1:27:10|[Liang Yan] was walking alone on the bridge when she suddenly heard [Yuan Mengyao]'s call.
1:27:24|1:27:37|Yuan Mengyao's call seemed to pass through the valley, gather along the stream into the river, and reach Liang Yan's ears at the bridge.
1:27:37|1:27:40|[Liang Yan] looked up to search, while [Yuan Mengyao] was still shouting.
1:27:46|1:27:50|[Liang Yan] closed her eyes, feeling the direction of the sound, and turned to look back.
1:28:1|1:28:6|[Liang Yan] and [Yuan Mengyao] were both eagerly searching for each other, and that's how they met.
1:28:6|1:28:12|In the moment when their eyes met, they ran towards each other, with indescribable happiness in their eyes.
1:28:12|1:28:21|The long-lost young couple cherished each other immensely, they stopped their running steps, slowly moved forward step by step, with unwavering and determined footsteps.
1:28:22|1:28:26|They looked at each other firmly and tenderly, cherishing this rare encounter.
1:28:26|1:28:31|[Yuan Mengyao] smiles with eyes full of love about to overflow.
1:28:31|1:28:34|[Liang Yan] was thrilled to see [Yuan Mengyao] and asked eagerly.
1:29:19|1:29:27|[Liang Yan] teased [Yuan Mengyao] by lifting her up horizontally. In an instant, [Yuan Mengyao] exclaimed in surprise, and eventually both of them smiled happily.
1:29:27|1:29:32|[Liang Yan] excitedly spins around while hugging [Yuan Mengyao], the loving couple finally reunited.
1:29:32|1:29:37|After a long separation, their reunion brought a lifetime of joy.
