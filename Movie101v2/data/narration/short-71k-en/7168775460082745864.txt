0:0:58|0:1:3|In the early morning, the sun rises over the city, and suddenly the parking lot lifts up, lifting a sedan.
0:1:3|0:1:6|At the construction site, a man's voice can be heard making a phone call.
0:1:12|0:1:17|The scene shifts, and Jin Lanlan opens the filing cabinet, skillfully turning on the computer.
0:1:17|0:1:24|The man on the phone looked nervous, while in the conference room on the other side, two women were discussing in low voices in front of a desk piled with documents.
0:1:24|0:1:30|With the sound of an engine revving, the scene cuts to a meeting room where a cup of tea is placed heavily next to [Jin Lanlan].
0:1:37|0:1:42|[Jin Lanlan] politely thanked, but didn't lift her head at all, her mind entirely focused on the documents in front of her.
0:1:42|0:1:47|[Huang Longbiao] took a deep breath and stared straight at [Jin Lanlan], who was working diligently.
0:1:47|0:1:51|She walked slowly out of the meeting room, then turned back, looking nervous.
0:1:51|0:1:56|[Huang Longbiao] walked out helplessly, and as soon as he looked up, the sunlight made him sneeze.
0:1:56|0:2:1|She looked around the construction site in front of her, then turned back to glance at [Jin Lanlan].
0:2:3|0:2:6|She shouted loudly in the empty space.
0:2:26|0:2:33|The scene changes, and [Jin Lanlan] and her group are taken to the construction site by [Huang Longbiao].
0:2:48|0:2:53|Huang Longbiao boasted for a while, but Jin Lanlan stared at the steel bars without saying a word, touching them with a questioning look.
0:3:6|0:3:9|[Huang Longbiao] was caught in a lie and awkwardly lowered his head.
0:3:9|0:3:19|In the hall, with a thunderous applause, [Jin Lanlan] walked onto the stage with a smile. A banner was hung on the stage to warmly send off Comrade [Jin Lanlan] to the rural base.
0:3:19|0:3:23|Applause continued as [Jin Lanlan] looked at the audience below and bowed deeply.
0:3:24|0:3:30|At night, with the city lights shining brightly, a little girl sits quietly at a table, playing with building blocks.
0:3:30|0:3:35|[Jin Lanlan] is typing on the keyboard, creating a daily routine and diet plan for her daughter Qiaoqiao.
0:3:35|0:3:41|She held the printed program schedule, looked at it with a pleased smile, and shouted loudly into the room.
0:3:48|0:3:55|The husband put down the kitchen knife, looked at the menu, pushed his glasses up and said.
0:3:55|0:3:59|Midway through her husband's speech, [Jin Lanlan] turned around and laughed at him.
0:3:59|0:4:5|The husband walked towards [Jin Lanlan] with a diet chart in his hand.
0:4:13|0:4:20|The scene shifts, with a light mist enveloping the village of Luo Genxin, the distant hillside appearing and disappearing, with houses neatly arranged.
0:4:20|0:4:25|[Huang Longbiao] dressed in a suit, carrying a briefcase, leisurely whistling as he walked along a country lane.
0:4:25|0:4:30|A man turned a corner and ran into Jin Lanlan, who appeared halfway down the road. Upon seeing her, the man immediately turned back.
0:4:37|0:4:44|[Huang Longbiao] ran while looking back, took out the car keys to open the door, and with a heavy closing sound, he left in a hurry.
0:4:44|0:4:50|The woman looked at [Huang Longbiao] running away, and said angrily.
0:4:50|0:5:0|A woman walks briskly on a deserted country road, occasionally using her hand to push back the bangs blown by the wind. She runs into the village committee, pushes open the door of the broadcasting room, and turns on the microphone.
0:5:24|0:5:30|The man put down his chopsticks and went out, only to run into [Luo Shanren] wearing a jacket with a worried look on his face.
0:5:30|0:5:33|In the distance, [Luo Shanren] was so anxious that he walked his shoes off.
0:5:33|0:5:34|The man sneered.
0:5:43|0:5:49|The mist-covered countryside, with the ground damp, [Luo Shanren] made a turn and arrived at the entrance of the village committee.
0:6:43|0:6:48|[Tao Hua] looked ferocious and stood up, addressing [Luo Genxin].
0:6:48|0:6:54|[Tao Hua] left angrily, followed by [Luo Genxin], while [Luo Shanren] stood still, staring at the departing two.
0:6:57|0:7:3|The scene shifts, [Tao Hua] arrives at the village stream on a tractor, determined to leave the village to seek justice.
0:7:58|0:8:3|Just then, Director [Fang] received a phone call and spoke to everyone.
0:8:18|0:8:25|Director Fang's face changed, he beckoned to a colleague beside him, pointed to the phone, and then walked out of the meeting room to speak on the phone.
0:9:3|0:9:7|The call was disconnected, [Luo Shanren] felt helpless and frustrated.
0:9:7|0:9:9|[Tao Hua] arrived at the township government and said to the people behind her.
0:9:22|0:9:26|Luo Genxin stared at the sign of the township government and said to Tao Hua.
0:9:41|0:9:50|Director Fang gave a few instructions, dismissed his subordinates, and with a worried look on his face, turned around to see Jin Lanlan and her group standing behind him.
0:10:9|0:10:14|In the courtyard of the township government, [Jin Lanlan] and the village chief welcomed [Tao Hua] who came from the village.
0:10:14|0:10:17|[Tao Hua] sat on the stone bench in silence, and the village chief broke the awkwardness.
0:12:13|0:12:20|Jin Lanlan sits on a tractor and returns to Luotang Village with Tao Hua.
0:13:13|0:13:18|A new life is about to begin, [Jin Lanlan] looks at the photo of her and her daughter, full of energy.
0:13:18|0:13:22|On the other side, [Luo Shanren] arrived at a small house on the second floor.
0:14:18|0:14:27|As the sun gradually sets, time slowly reaches 7 o'clock in the evening. The village committee is unusually quiet, with only the sound of the clock ticking away.
0:14:27|0:14:36|[Jin Lanlan] glanced at the clock, then looked around the empty conference room with a serious expression. Outside the room, [Luo Shanren] checked his watch anxiously, waiting impatiently.
0:14:36|0:14:40|After a while, she straightened her jacket, cleared her throat, and walked towards the conference room.
0:14:40|0:14:46|As soon as she entered, [Luo Shanren] saw [Jin Lanlan] standing with her back to her, and immediately changed her expression.
0:14:50|0:14:53|[Luo Shanren] was somewhat surprised by his attitude towards [Jin Lanlan].
0:15:17|0:15:21|Watching [Jin Lanlan] leaving, the person upstairs muttered to themselves.
0:15:21|0:15:24|After a moment of contemplation, she couldn't keep up with her hands in her pockets.
0:15:53|0:16:0|[Luo Shanren] brought [Jin Lanlan] to the door, he knocked on the latch, and the person inside responded.
0:16:17|0:16:20|In the house, [Tao Hua] slapped his thigh, looking ferocious.
0:16:28|0:16:34|In the courtyard, [Tao Hua] leaned against the wall and called Shan Shan back, gently pulling her away from the door.
0:16:34|0:16:37|Outside the door, [Jin Lanlan] listened in silence, looking puzzled.
0:17:11|0:17:14|[Luo Shanren] took a deep breath and quickly took the opportunity to leave.
0:17:14|0:17:20|[Jin Lanlan] watched as [Luo Shanren] walked away, then glanced through the crack of the door at [Tao Hua]'s house, shaking her head with a bitter smile.
0:17:20|0:17:29|As the night grew darker, [Jin Lanlan] walked alone in the village of Luotang, looking at the unfamiliar houses around her. She stopped in her tracks, tears welling up in her eyes.
0:17:29|0:17:35|After a moment of contemplation, [Jin Lanlan] continued to walk forward. It was late at night, and the only sound on the country road was the continuous chirping of insects.
0:17:36|0:17:43|[Jin Lanlan] dragged her weary body, head down and pace slow, as a bright street lamp guided her back to the house.
0:17:43|0:17:49|At the moment she crossed the threshold, a sense of powerlessness struck her, and she could only slowly walk in while leaning on the door frame.
0:17:49|0:17:53|With a heavy body, [Jin Lanlan] closed the door.
0:17:53|0:18:0|At this moment, a sudden ringing of the phone interrupted, and [Jin Lanlan] leaned against the wall to take out her phone to check.
0:18:14|0:18:18|[Jin Lanlan] took a deep breath, closed her eyes, and said.
0:18:46|0:18:49|Alright, since you're not willing to back down.
0:19:9|0:19:18|In the early morning, a thin mist hung in the air, the sound of attacks echoing throughout the village. Most of the villagers were still fast asleep, with no one on the roads in the village.
0:19:18|0:19:28|[Jin Lanlan] is wearing comfortable sportswear for a morning run in Luotang Village. She passes through houses and alleys, crosses winding streams and stone bridges covered with plants.
0:19:28|0:19:33|[Jin Lanlan] adjusted her emotions, walked lightly, and arrived at the old secretary's second-floor attic.
0:19:40|0:19:44|[Jin Lanlan] praised the flowers, smelling and looking at them, while the old secretary was busy watering the plants.
0:20:22|0:20:25|The old secretary glared at [Jin Lanlan] in front of him, then turned and went downstairs.
0:20:25|0:20:32|[Jin Lanlan] playfully watched the angry old secretary leave, smiling as she leaned on the railing and shouted down to him.
0:20:36|0:20:58|Yu Bi's face changed from anger to surprise. She turned her head to look at [Jin Lanlan] upstairs. [Jin Lanlan] on the attic still had a smile on her face, then turned and walked downstairs. The old secretary walked towards the small wooden table with her hands behind her back, deep in thought. [Jin Lanlan] coming down from the second floor called out to her and put her hand on the old secretary's shoulder.
0:20:58|0:21:5|He patted her on the back, gesturing for her to sit down. They sat side by side, and the old secretary turned his head to the side. [Jin Lanlan] took the opportunity to speak.
0:21:46|0:21:56|The old secretary looked at the furrowed brow of [Jin Lanlan] and after a moment of contemplation, he spoke to her.
0:21:56|0:22:1|The old secretary sighed helplessly, lost in thought.
0:23:39|0:23:44|The scene cuts to [Luo Shanren] finishing a large jug of water and making a sound of enjoyment.
0:23:44|0:23:45|He puts down the water glass.
0:26:33|0:26:36|It was when the strawberry needed water.
0:28:17|0:28:21|Yu Bi, [Jin Lanlan] looks determined, ready to solve the matter.
0:28:21|0:28:23|In the park, [Huang Longbiao]'s phone rings.
0:29:13|0:29:20|The scene changes, and the banknote printing machine hums loudly. Inside the teahouse, [Huang Longbiao] hands the cowhide paper containing banknotes to [Jin Lanlan].
0:29:40|0:29:46|[Jin Lanlan] picked up the paper bag and opened it, only to see [Huang Longbiao] gesturing with his hands. [Jin Lanlan] looked at him and spoke.
0:29:58|0:30:3|[Huang Longbiao] looked at [Jin Lanlan] in astonishment, his body stiffening as he leaned back.
0:30:3|0:30:7|[Jin Lanlan] smiled as she looked at him. [Huang Longbiao] sneered coldly.
0:30:29|0:30:32|[Huang Longbiao] looked aggrieved, sighed, and continued speaking.
0:30:52|0:31:2|In the early morning, birds chirped, and the sun shone brightly outside the house. Early riser [Jin Lanlan] pulled up the curtains and tidied up the bed.
0:31:2|0:31:7|The interior is simple and plain, with only a table and a shelf as the entire furniture in the room.
0:31:7|0:31:13|[Jin Lanlan] soaked the towel, carefully wiped her cheeks, and then tidied her hair under the mirror.
0:31:14|0:31:25|Sent to deal with the excess water, she busied herself with eating. She casually picked up a packet of instant noodles from the table, sat on the edge of the bed, and opened it. Suddenly, as if she remembered something, her hands stopped moving.
0:31:25|0:31:37|After a moment of contemplation, [Jin Lanlan] placed the instant noodles back on the table and got up to leave. Her figure grew increasingly distant, gradually becoming blurred. The instant noodles on the table and the photo of her daughter beside it remained untouched, with no one else coming near them.
0:31:37|0:31:52|In the quiet village, [Jin Lanlan] walked briskly, looking around as she walked. Just around the corner, she saw a house with a slightly ajar door. She smiled and pushed open the door gently, walking closer. The courtyard was quiet and empty, with various plants growing.
0:31:53|0:31:58|As she walked further in, Jin Lanlan saw the serious Shan Shan sitting in the small courtyard, writing something.
0:31:58|0:32:3|Her steps were light as she slowly approached, unwilling to disturb the serious Jin Lanlan in front of her.
0:32:3|0:32:8|She then bent down, leaned close to Jin Lanlan's ear, and Jin Lanlan, who was focused, was startled.
0:35:47|0:35:53|Luo Genxin watched Luo Shanren walking away, feeling a mix of emotions in his heart. He clenched his fist and a thought emerged in his mind.
0:35:53|0:36:10|At night, a bag was hung on the door of [Jin Lanlan]'s room, containing a square gift box. It looked very valuable. He opened the door, took the bag and looked at it for a long time without any clue. Then he walked out, looking around. In the distance, a man was standing with his hands behind his back.
0:36:10|0:36:21|Walking on the deserted road, looking at the man's back, he seemed to understand something, smiled slightly, then turned around and saw the bag on the door. After a moment of contemplation, he took the bag down and walked into the house.
0:36:21|0:36:31|The night was late, and the village of Luo Tang was very quiet, with only the sound of frogs still chirping. [Luo Genxin] walked home with his hands in his pockets, looking relaxed and content.
0:36:31|0:36:39|Inside the house, Luo Genxin's daughter is diligently doing her homework. Hearing some noise outside the door, she stops writing and looks up, seeing Luo Genxin returning. She complains to him.
0:36:42|0:36:50|The daughter saw [Luo Genxin] not responding for a long time, then turned her head and put down the pen in her hand, walking towards him.
0:37:10|0:37:14|The daughter nodded heavily at [Luo Genxin], and at this moment, there was a knock on the door.
0:37:33|0:37:41|Luo Genxin walked out with his hands behind his back, and as soon as he stepped out of the door, he saw a bag on the ground with square gift boxes inside, all intact.
0:37:41|0:37:47|[Luo Genxin] looked around with a bag in his hand, only to see the figure of [Jin Lanlan] getting farther and farther away in the distance.
0:37:47|0:37:51|He looked incredulous and turned around to walk into the room in a daze.
0:37:51|0:37:57|At the table, [Luo Genxin] held the bag for a long time, then put it down heavily, leaning on the table with both hands, deep in thought.
0:37:59|0:38:3|The doctor's train of thought was abruptly interrupted by the unexpected text message alert.
0:38:37|0:38:41|With a resounding clang that echoed through the sky, Luo Shanren's day began again.
0:38:41|0:38:47|The thin morning mist shrouded the countryside, and [Jin Lanlan], as usual, got up early for a morning run.
0:38:47|0:38:51|She walked through the alleys of the house and finally disappeared at the end of the road.
0:38:51|0:38:54|The scene cuts to [Huang Longbiao] arriving at the village committee of [Luo Tang Village].
0:38:54|0:38:58|He stood outside the meeting room door knocking for a long time, but no one opened it.
0:38:58|0:39:3|He pressed his ear against the door, made sure there was no sound, and then began to look around and wander aimlessly.
0:39:10|0:39:15|He walked cautiously, observing his surroundings for any familiar faces as he moved.
0:39:15|0:39:20|[Huang Longbiao] opens the car door, starts the car in one go, without any intention of stopping for long.
0:39:21|0:39:30|At this moment, [Luo Genxin] happened to come out from the corner and saw [Huang Longbiao], so he hurriedly chased after him. However, the timing was not right, so he could only helplessly sniff the ashes.
0:39:30|0:39:34|Luo Genxin didn't hesitate at all and immediately turned around and ran back to the village.
0:39:34|0:39:36|At the next intersection, he arrived at the door of [Tao Hua]'s house.
0:40:40|0:40:46|[Tao Hua] took off her apron and turned to leave. [Luo Genxin] was so scared by [Tao Hua] that he stood still, watching her leaving and muttering quietly.
0:41:0|0:41:8|After some self-encouragement, [Luo Genxin] happily turned around and left, while [Huang Longbiao] parked the car at the strawberry plantation, coincidentally passing by the old secretary.
0:41:8|0:41:15|He shielded his eyes with his hand, trying to see if there was anyone in the car. When he turned his head, he saw [Huang Longbiao] squatting alone in the strawberry field.
0:41:15|0:41:29|The old secretary hurriedly went down to the field, but unexpectedly he fell into the ground. He dusted off his clothes and the dirt in his hands, and headed towards [Huang Longbiao] with a single-minded focus. However, [Huang Longbiao], who was squatting on the ground, was busy playing with the strawberry seedlings in front of him, completely unaware of the old secretary's arrival.
0:41:29|0:41:32|The old secretary slowly approached him, bending over to speak to him.
0:41:34|0:41:40|Oh, the old secretary has a serious expression, staring straight at [Huang Longbiao].
0:43:41|0:43:48|The scene shifts to inside Luo Tang Village, where [Luo Genxin] has gathered a group of people and they are marching aggressively along the path towards the fields.
0:43:48|0:43:59|[Tao Hua] was at home drying grains when [Luo Shanren] hurriedly ran over, almost tripping. He gasped for breath and said.
0:44:25|0:44:43|On the other side, [Jin Lanlan] heard about this matter and became extremely anxious. While the sun was shining brightly in Luotang Village under a clear sky, [Jin Lanlan] was feeling extremely worried. She ran all the way without daring to stop for a moment. The quiet village only heard the sound of her footsteps, and the sound of flowers absorbing water seemed to be urging her on.
0:44:43|0:44:46|[Tao Hua] leisurely drinks tea at home, while [Luo Shanren] looks troubled.
0:45:24|0:45:34|The scene shifts to [Luo Genxin] commanding two tractors, slowly breaking the iron net in the strawberry field. The levelling machine in the middle is used to remove the strawberry seedlings.
0:45:34|0:45:42|At this moment, [Jin Lanlan] ran over from a distance, shouting and waving to signal them to stop. She blocked the tractor with her body and shouted loudly at [Luo Genxin] on the vehicle.
0:46:26|0:46:31|Tao Hua and [Jin Lanlan] looked at the aggrieved [Luo Genxin] in front of them, feeling both angry and helpless.
0:46:31|0:46:35|[Luo Genxin] realized his mistake, turned his head to the side, and squatted on the ground in shame.
0:46:35|0:46:37|Walking into a room, [Huang Longbiao] slams the contract on the table.
0:48:22|0:48:26|In a warm and friendly atmosphere, we reached a consensus.
0:49:31|0:49:40|[Luo Shanren] was so angry that he could only pace back and forth in front of the village committee, hands on hips and shaking his head, but he could only console himself.
0:50:24|0:50:28|On the construction site, [Huang Longbiao] walks while talking on the phone.
0:51:4|0:51:8|[Luo Shanren] picked up the teapot and took a sip while making the phone call, then continued speaking.
0:53:27|0:53:41|The scene shifts, the sky is very gloomy, thunder rumbles, and pouring rain falls from the sky, shaking the surrounding trees. [Jin Lanlan] rushes out of the taxi, but still ends up drenched.
0:54:48|0:54:53|The wasp chased by the storm, like countless whips, lashing at the houses of [Luo Tangcun].
0:54:53|0:54:58|In the room, [Jin Lanlan] sat at the desk, illuminated by the light of the only desk lamp, dealing with official business.
0:54:58|0:55:0|For some unknown reason, the lights suddenly went out.
0:55:0|0:55:6|[Jin Lanlan] quickly got up and opened the door to check, at this moment, the phone rang.
0:55:6|0:55:9|[Jin Lanlan] looked outside, where the torrential rain continued unabated.
0:55:11|0:55:17|After hanging up the phone, [Jin Lanlan] put on a plastic raincoat, grabbed a flashlight, tightened the collar, and ran into the rain.
0:55:17|0:55:23|The heavy rain became more and more intense, with thunder constantly coming from the sky, and the strong wind raging to block Jin Lanlan's path.
0:55:23|0:55:28|She could only rely on the faint light of the flashlight to walk laboriously in the rain.
0:55:28|0:55:31|Turning around again, she saw Aunt [Luo Genxin] sitting in a wheelchair, gazing into the rain.
0:55:56|0:56:0|Outside, the heavy rain continued unabated, and all the pots at [Luo Shanren]'s house were used to collect rainwater.
0:56:1|0:56:9|[Jin Lanlan] shone her flashlight towards the ceiling, only to find a large hole above. Without hesitation, she picked up the ladder outside and climbed up to the roof.
0:56:9|0:56:16|The thunder roared, and the heavy rain washed over Jin Lanlan's face. She struggled to stand up with an umbrella in her hand, while Director Luo Shanren worried about her and shouted loudly.
0:56:20|0:56:28|[Jin Lanlan] had just climbed onto the roof when the ladder beneath her feet fell down. She quickly looked back, but didn't have time to think much, and continued climbing towards the hole in the roof.
0:56:28|0:56:33|[Jin Lanlan] lowered her head to adjust her state, pushed aside the broken tiles, and turned back to comfort those who were more spirited.
0:56:39|0:56:45|Jin Lanlan took a deep breath and quickened her movements, lifting the damaged tiles one by one.
0:56:45|0:56:52|Then, the rain shelter was neatly laid out, completely covering the hole, and the four corners were secured with nearby tiles.
0:56:52|0:56:56|[Jin Lanlan], dressed in clothes, continued to be drenched by the non-stop heavy rain.
0:56:57|0:57:15|The rain washed the tiles making them extremely slippery. [Jin Lanlan] was focused on her hands, almost slipping and falling due to the slippery surface. Below, [Luo Shanren] sat in a wheelchair, holding a flashlight and closely watching [Jin Lanlan] with a tense and worried expression. Gasping for breath, [Jin Lanlan] lay on the roof, rain mercilessly beating down on her.
0:57:15|0:57:29|Constantly testing her endurance, [Jin Lanlan] pushed aside the wet hair covering her cheeks. After taking a short break, she continued with the task at hand, repositioning the canopy. This time, her speed noticeably slowed down, taking a break after securing the canopy each time.
0:57:29|0:57:37|He held down the umbrella being lifted by the strong wind with one hand, and pushed aside the broken flower petals with the other hand, repeating this action countless times.
0:57:37|0:57:44|He fixed the awning again, and the sudden thunder scared him, causing him to slip and almost fall.
0:57:44|0:57:46|Finally, he secured the awning in place.
0:57:46|0:57:54|Looking at the eaves behind him, [Luo Shanren] subconsciously climbed up a few centimeters, then collapsed limp on the chair, letting the rain beat down on him.
0:57:57|0:58:17|In the early morning, as the dark clouds dispersed and birds chirped, [Jin Lanlan]'s bed was neatly made. The clock on the bedside table showed 6:05, next to a photo of [Jin Lanlan] and her daughter. Inside the room, clothes on the rack were still dripping with rainwater, but [Jin Lanlan] was not there. The scene then shifted.
0:58:17|0:58:21|[Jin Lanlan] is running along the stream, and [Luo Shanren] sees her and quickly calls out to her.
0:59:16|0:59:19|It was him who brought your strawberry seedlings back to life.
1:1:50|1:1:55|Plant those strawberries using modern planting techniques to increase yield.
1:2:38|1:2:39|If we can't sell it in two days.
1:3:24|1:3:26|The average income per capita is 496.79 yuan.
1:3:44|1:3:49|Before the words were finished, the door was kicked open, and [Luo Genxin] walked into the meeting room with a serious expression, hands behind his back.
1:4:22|1:4:34|Luo Genxin brought Jin Lanlan to a old tree in Lotang Village, with her back facing Jin Lanlan, he swiftly took off his jacket and made a series of martial arts strokes in the air.
1:4:34|1:4:38|[Jin Lanlan] playfully looks at [Luo Genxin], who slowly turns around.
1:5:23|1:5:30|The atmosphere gradually eased, [Luo Genxin] picked up the coat on the ground and sat on the steps, with [Jin Lanlan] following suit.
1:6:26|1:6:27|Du Zong sentenced for a night.
1:7:33|1:7:44|[Jin Lanlan] smiled and watched the old secretary leave, feeling relieved as she finally gained the old secretary's approval.
1:7:44|1:7:45|Jiao Jiao's loud shout came from the village of Luo Tang.
1:8:9|1:8:13|Jiao Jiao waved her acceptance letter and ran towards [Luo Genxin].
1:8:13|1:8:17|[Luo Genxin] sat at the door, staring at the notice, with an incredulous look on his face.
1:10:15|1:10:40|To eat a delicacy, you have to smile at people and endure their punches. What are you saying? Slow down, slow down, slow down. For generations, the Luo Tang Village has held positions like this. [Luo Genxin] puts the plump fish into the frying pan, ready to show off his skills. Jiaojiao walks into the kitchen and says, "Dad, Dad, did you watch the opera before?"
1:11:23|1:11:27|Upon hearing the high tuition fees, [Luo Genxin] fell into contemplation, while Jiaojiao waved her hand.
1:11:33|1:11:52|Luo Genxin said it was nothing, but his expression became somewhat embarrassed. The high tuition fees made him headache, and he had no appetite for the sizzling fish in the pot. As night fell, the lively Luo Tang Village became quiet. Luo Genxin sat alone by the window, one hand on the windowsill, the other propping up his chin, staring blankly at the roof.
1:11:52|1:12:11|After a while, he stood up again and looked at the moonlight outside the window, his face full of heavy thoughts. Before long, he sat by the flowerpot, playing with the leaves inside, looking very melancholic. Finally, he returned to the desk, holding his beloved brush and pondering for a long time. He wrote down the four characters for "urgent housing" with his brush, then stared blankly ahead.
1:12:11|1:12:18|With a look of helplessness and reluctance in her eyes, [Jin Lanlan] quietly approached the back of [Luo Genxin], wanting to give him a surprise.
1:13:55|1:14:0|[Luo Genxin] pushed [Jin Lanlan] out of the room, quickly closed the door, and then leaned down against the door lock.
1:14:0|1:14:13|At this moment, a thousand emotions surged in her heart. Her eyes gradually moistened as she sat weakly on the edge of the bed, looking at everything in the room. Although the house was not big, it was filled with joy and warmth, and memories of the past were still vivid.
1:14:13|1:14:16|[Luo Genxin] thought this way in his heart, and tears fell down unexpectedly.
1:14:16|1:14:19|She quickly wiped it away with her hand, controlling her emotions.
1:14:19|1:14:24|The next day arrived, with the warm sun shining over the village of Luo Tang. [Huang Longbiao] was up early as usual for his morning run.
1:14:25|1:14:40|Passing by the door of Luo Genxin's house, Jin Lanlan saw a notice posted there. She stopped and approached to take a look. The notice stated that the house was for urgent sale, the owner wanted to sell the old house quickly, it was a feng shui treasure land, with a discounted price. Interested parties could negotiate in person, insincere parties were not welcome. Luo Genxin.
1:14:40|1:14:48|Jin Lanlan walked up to the notice privately, her eyes flickered, a thought suddenly appeared, she folded the notice simply, smiled and continued to run towards the village.
1:14:50|1:14:55|The camera slowly moves up, outside the house the sun is shining brightly, and the birds are chirping happily.
1:14:55|1:15:0|The room was very dark, with [Luo Genxin] sitting by the window, lost in thought after a sleepless night.
1:15:5|1:15:8|[Jin Lanlan]'s husband rushed over in an apron and was very happy to see the incoming call.
1:15:16|1:15:19|Upon hearing this, [Jin Lanlan] suddenly remembered something, instantly regretting it. She felt a bit embarrassed and started speaking incoherently.
1:16:5|1:16:8|Jin Lanlan's tears fell instantly, and she quickly covered the phone's microphone.
1:16:39|1:16:46|The scene shifts, with [Jin Lanlan] stepping lightly, holding a sign advertising a house for urgent sale, as she arrives at the bottom of [Luo Genxin]'s building.
1:16:46|1:16:50|She looked up and saw Luo Genxin sitting by the window in a daze, and shouted at him.
1:17:0|1:17:7|When Luo Genxin spoke, he turned his head to the side. Jin Lanlan, seeing this, took out a urgent house sale notice and unfolded it for him to see.
1:17:7|1:17:7|[Luo Genxin] is impatient.
1:17:23|1:17:28|[Luo Genxin] instantly perked up and, after speaking, slowly walked down the stairs with his hands behind his back.
1:17:28|1:17:34|[Jin Lanlan] lowered her head and smiled, teasingly looking at him, as [Luo Genxin] pointed to the chair and said to [Jin Lanlan].

1:21:21|1:21:26|[Tao Hua] is cooking in the kitchen when she hears [Luo Genxin] shouting as he runs.
1:21:53|1:21:59|Luo Genxin listened and then looked at Tao Hua and Luo Shanren sitting beside him, reluctantly took out twenty thousand yuan.
1:21:59|1:22:3|He carefully counted the money and then threw it on the table.
1:22:11|1:22:17|Luo Genxin rolled his eyes, sat down with a heavy heart facing away from everyone, and then [Tao Hua] stood up.
1:26:25|1:26:36|On the highway, [Jin Lanlan] is driving back to Luotang Village.
1:26:36|1:26:40|Night quietly falls, [Jin Lanlan]'s husband is preparing a birthday cake.
