0:1:45|0:1:50|The camera focuses on a residential building and follows it inside, arriving at the home of [Hao Liansheng].
0:1:50|0:1:56|On the wall hangs a wedding photo of him and his wife Xiaomin, both smiling sweetly with faces full of happiness.
0:1:56|0:2:0|It's still early, the person in the photo is fast asleep.
0:2:24|0:2:31|But some potential troubles will unknowingly walk into your life.
0:2:31|0:2:37|At 6:30, the alarm clock rang on time. [Hao Liansheng] groggily reached for the alarm clock and sleepily turned off the alarm.
0:2:37|0:2:44|He turned over and found Xiaomin's hand resting on his head. After pulling it over and giving it a gentle kiss, he got up from the bed.
0:2:44|0:2:53|It's still early, but people in the city have already started to get busy. Some are picking vegetables at the morning market, some are rushing to work, some are going to have breakfast. The streets are bustling.
0:2:53|0:2:56|At this moment, Hao Zheng, the son of Hao Liansheng, crosses the street.
0:2:56|0:3:0|Hao Liansheng walks into Dezheng Street Market, dressed in a police uniform, with a straight posture.
0:3:0|0:3:6|At home, [Hao Liansheng] is brushing his teeth and washing his face. He wipes off the toothpaste residue from the corners of his mouth with a towel, and casually looks at himself in the mirror.
0:3:34|0:3:39|[Hao Liansheng] came home and [Hao Zheng], who was shaving, walked out.
0:5:9|0:5:10|He said.
0:5:35|0:5:49|[Hao Liansheng] put on his suit, grabbed his briefcase, ready to go to work, but stopped at the door.
0:5:49|0:5:53|After speaking, he confidently went to work, and at this moment, [Xiaomin] walked out of the bathroom.
0:6:3|0:6:6|At this moment, [Hao Liansheng] is getting off his bicycle.
0:6:51|0:7:3|[Hao Liansheng] had a look of discontent on his face. He kicked the foot lamp complainingly, got into the car swiftly, disregarding his neighbor's words. The street was bustling with traffic, but there was only [Hao Liansheng] on the bicycle lane.
0:7:3|0:7:10|He pedaled his bike with a smile, not feeling strange about it. He glanced at his watch, increased the pace of his feet towards the company.
0:7:10|0:7:16|Before long, [Hao Liansheng] arrived at the office. He greeted the security guard while pushing his cart, and entered the building at 7:55 sharp.
0:7:17|0:7:22|He entered the office with a friendly smile, greeted his colleagues, and they all responded in kind.
0:8:4|0:8:8|The crowd felt disappointed, with a hint of dissatisfaction on [Hao Liansheng]'s face.
0:8:26|0:8:29|At the board meeting, everyone had their own thoughts, with different expressions.
0:9:40|0:9:52|At this moment, the secretary [Huahua] walked into the meeting room and stood beside President Wang, instantly capturing the attention of the chairman.
0:9:52|0:9:56|Weak and frail, Mr. Wang struggled to get up.
0:9:56|0:10:2|Before the words were finished, Mr. Wang started coughing violently. [Huahua] quickly helped him sit down and handed him the medicine.
0:10:24|0:10:29|Today we nominated the candidate for general manager, and everyone seems to have a good idea in their hearts, as if Vice President Hao Zheng is the silent number one.
0:11:35|0:11:41|The TV started playing, with [Xiang Zhudan] looking forward to the show, while Mr. Wang lightly rubbed his eyes, his face full of curiosity.
0:11:41|0:11:50|In the scene, the well-proportioned [Huahua] in a tight camisole dress is holding documents and looking for [Hao Liansheng] to sign. She deliberately tries to get close to [Hao Liansheng], but he skillfully avoids her.
0:11:50|0:11:59|But [Huahua] still lingered around him, and [Hao Liansheng] finally left as if escaping.
0:11:59|0:12:9|With a smile of relief towards [Zhu Dan], Chairman Dong lowered his eyes in self-mutilation and bribery. The TV screen cut to the office, where [Huahua] was wearing the same clothes, looking for documents.
0:12:9|0:12:13|Vice President Zhou got closer and closer to him, and finally pulled him into his arms.
0:12:18|0:12:24|Everyone shook their heads, even Vice President Zhou couldn't bear to watch and buried his head without saying a word.
0:12:24|0:12:26|The chairman snorted coldly in anger.
0:12:38|0:12:56|One by one, everyone walked out of the meeting room, but Vice President Zhou remained seated, motionless. He rested his head on his hand, looking as lifeless as a deflated ball.
0:13:2|0:13:5|Deputy General Manager Zhou just shook his head repeatedly without saying a word.
0:13:5|0:13:7|At this moment, [Hao Liansheng] is in a phone booth.
0:13:38|0:13:59|Speak up, [Hao Liansheng] turned and walked away, while his colleague with long hair spread out her hands, indicating extreme speechlessness.
0:13:59|0:14:5|The two of them came to the cafeteria to eat together, and the colleague with long hair suddenly asked [Hao Liansheng], "Hey, did you hear any unusual noises?"
0:14:30|0:14:49|Abiao, last time he flirted with Ah Juan from the production department after drinking, and got fired by the company.
0:14:49|0:14:53|Less than half a year later, he caused trouble again.
0:14:56|0:15:3|This guy was abandoned by his wife two years ago, now he is all alone, no wonder he is fooling around.
0:15:36|0:15:38|[Huahua] walked towards [Hao Liansheng] at this moment.
0:16:13|0:16:19|The room was full of people all staring at [Huahua] in a trance. Even after everyone had left, they still couldn't take their eyes off him.
0:16:33|0:16:41|[Hao Liansheng] has been waiting in the chairman's office for several hours. At this moment, [Liu Qingbiao] is in the office organizing everyone to prepare for the celebration ceremony.
0:17:24|0:17:30|After drinking a few glasses of alcohol, [Hao Liansheng], unable to handle the alcohol, slumped in his chair, when a voice sounded in his head.
0:17:40|0:17:44|[Hao Liansheng] slowly opened his eyes and let out a sigh.
0:18:3|0:18:7|After the health aunt left, [Hao Liansheng] raised his hand to check the time.
0:18:7|0:18:16|As the night fell, Hao Liansheng quickly rubbed his face to wake himself up a bit, then took out a jewelry box from the drawer and examined the gold necklace inside.
0:18:16|0:18:17|He watched as the gold necklace triggered memories.
0:18:17|0:18:25|Today is [Lin Manli]'s birthday. She moved here to work just a year ago from Hong Kong.
0:18:33|0:18:42|[Hao Liansheng] hurried to the station, repeatedly checking the time to avoid being late. As soon as he saw the town exit, he quickly ran towards it. Despite his nervousness, an unexpected incident occurred.
0:18:47|0:19:3|[Hao Liansheng] busied himself, only to realize he was looking in the wrong place. He hung up the phone in a hurry and headed to the correct destination. Just as he ran out, he found that he forgot to remove the SIM card and hurried back. Finally, after a lot of effort, he found the place. He stood at the subway entrance, looking back and forth with a photo of [Lin Manli] in his hand, but couldn't find her after a long time.
0:19:3|0:19:11|At this moment, he saw a woman on the roadside slowly pulling a suitcase forward, so he quickly approached to inquire.
0:19:17|0:19:20|It's hard to finally see someone, but it's not [Lin Manli].
0:19:20|0:19:26|[Hao Liansheng] fiddled around in the same spot for a while, then sat on a nearby stool dejectedly, with a face full of worry.
0:19:26|0:19:29|He was worried that he couldn't complete the mission and would let down [Xiang Zhudan]'s trust in him.
0:19:29|0:19:37|Thinking of this, he took out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and lit one, exhaling weakly, but his eyes kept scanning around, afraid of missing the real Lin Manli.
0:19:38|0:19:43|At this moment, a stylishly dressed woman with a suitcase stopped next to [Hao Liansheng].
0:19:43|0:19:50|She saw the photo on the table, smiled faintly, and asked [Hao Liansheng].
0:19:52|0:19:57|[Hao Liansheng] didn't pay much attention at first, but when he saw the woman's luggage, he suddenly stood up.
0:20:7|0:20:17|[Hao Liansheng] was afraid of the smoke bothering [Lin Manli], so he hurriedly put it out for her. He wanted to throw away the cigarette butt but couldn't find a trash can, so he awkwardly laughed a few times. [Lin Manli] was amused by his appearance.
0:20:31|0:20:35|[Hao Liansheng] quickly packed up his bags, while [Lin Manli] quietly waited beside him.
0:20:35|0:20:41|Suddenly, she saw... [Lin Manli] anxiously pouring the muddy water into a bag.
0:20:52|0:21:1|After going through all the trouble, Hao Liansheng and Lin Manli finally set off. The two arrived at the main street, where various shops were brightly lit with signs, creating a lively and bustling atmosphere.
0:21:1|0:21:7|[Hao Liansheng] took [Lin Manli] into a restaurant called Fulin Seafood, where his wife often worked.
0:21:53|0:21:59|Your company's [Xiang Zhudan] knows that he is honest and respects him, that's why he was entrusted with an important task.
0:22:42|0:22:45|After dinner, [Hao Liansheng] took [Lin Manli] to the furniture store.
0:23:13|0:23:16|Speak up, [Hao Liansheng] gets up from the bed and walks out angrily.
0:23:23|0:23:29|To avoid any further misunderstandings, [Hao Liansheng] let [Lin Manli] go shopping by herself, while he waited outside.
0:23:29|0:23:38|He was very responsible and worried that the girls would not be safe alone at night, so he sat in a place very close to him, where [Lin Manli] could see him with just a glance.
0:23:38|0:23:40|[Hao Liansheng] lights a cigarette.
0:23:40|0:23:49|Watching [Lin Manli] lost in thought while picking furniture in the store, at this moment, [Hao Zheng] and his colleague on duty happened to pass by and saw [Hao Liansheng].
0:24:37|0:24:40|Oh, Hao Zheng hurriedly escapes.
0:24:48|0:24:52|[Hao Liansheng] walked towards his son, looking impatient.
0:24:52|0:25:3|The memory ends, but the smile still lingers on the lips.
0:25:3|0:25:8|[Hao Liansheng] puts the necklace into a box, and then closes the family photo that was placed on the table.
0:25:8|0:25:15|He wanted to put the box into his pocket, but then felt it was inappropriate. He took off his suit and draped it aside, stood up, not knowing what other tricks he wanted to figure out.
0:25:17|0:25:31|The sun is sucking blood, the afterglow of the setting sun falls on the Pearl River, causing layers of ripples. Cars are speeding across the bridge, while below the bridge, a cruise ship is quietly sailing on the river, carrying tourists to enjoy the beautiful scenery. [Hao Liansheng] leaves the company and arrives at the cake shop.
0:27:32|0:27:36|[Meimei] hung up the phone, with a happy face, chuckled, and continued to immerse herself in work.
0:27:36|0:27:39|[Hao Liansheng], who has kept his wife in the dark, rides a bike to find [Lin Manli].
0:27:39|0:27:47|She lives in a beautifully renovated building, with convenient transportation downstairs and many supermarkets and restaurants nearby, in a very good location.
0:27:47|0:27:51|[Hao Liansheng] quickly parked the car and took the cake from the back seat into the building.
0:27:52|0:27:57|He looked nervous all the way, constantly looking around, afraid of being discovered.
0:27:57|0:28:1|In the elevator, [Hao Liansheng] was busy checking the surroundings and momentarily forgot to look at the road.
0:28:1|0:28:9|Hao Liansheng hurriedly walked into the elevator without noticing someone coming out, and clumsily bumped into the person.
0:28:23|0:28:32|The woman turned and walked away in anger, but she was definitely not relieved. She glared at him a few more times before [Hao Liansheng] entered the elevator, closed his eyes, and began to daydream.
0:28:32|0:28:38|In his imagination, he was in a sharp suit, holding a rose, and anxiously stepped into [Lin Manli]'s home after the elevator arrived.
0:28:38|0:28:48|The excitement made him feel like he was floating on cloud nine, walking in an S shape. And at this moment, [Lin Manli] was holding a bouquet of roses, dressed in a wedding gown, waiting for him with a smile on her face.
0:28:50|0:29:2|[Hao Liansheng] rushed in eagerly, seeing [Lin Manli] standing there like a fairy, her pupils dilating with excitement. [Lin Manli] also embraced her, gently kissing her on the cheek.
0:29:26|0:29:31|The two embraced on a haystack, [Hao Liansheng] took [Lin Manli]'s hand and danced a graceful waltz.
0:29:31|0:29:42|They jumped back and forth between the park and home, reluctant to part with each other. All they could see in each other's eyes was the reflection of themselves, with happy smiles on their faces.
0:29:43|0:30:1|[Hao Liansheng] pulled [Lin Manli] in circles, the hem of the wedding dress swaying with the movements, as beautiful as the foreign doll of the octaves monk. She closed her eyes in ecstasy, her lips curled with a wave, perhaps out of guilt, the person in front of her suddenly changed from [Lin Manli] to [Meimei], wearing a suit with a crochet flower pinned to his chest.
0:30:1|0:30:4|Although not as young as [Lin Manli], she still has her own unique charm.
0:30:4|0:30:7|[Hao Liansheng], still immersed in it, did not immediately notice.
0:30:7|0:30:14|After a while, he slowly opened his eyes. When he saw the person in front of him clearly, his smile disappeared instantly, and he stopped five steps away.
0:30:14|0:30:19|[Hao Liansheng] suddenly woke up, shaking his head frantically, trying to shake off this harmful scene.
0:30:19|0:30:21|He blinked his eyes, still in shock.
0:30:40|0:30:44|The woman looked at him wordlessly as the elevator jumped up floor by floor.
0:30:44|0:30:47|After reaching the 13th floor, [Hao Liansheng] came down with a gloomy expression.
0:30:47|0:30:52|The woman was curious about where he lived and wanted to follow him to take a look, but she was discovered and retreated.
0:30:53|0:30:59|[Hao Liansheng] walked towards [Lin Manli]'s house in a daze, still immersed in the fear he had just experienced and unable to extricate himself.
0:30:59|0:31:3|At this moment, [Hao Liansheng] rushed out of [Lin Manli]'s house as if fleeing for his life, looking very panicked.
0:31:6|0:31:9|[Hao Liansheng] quickly rushed into the elevator and pressed the floor button.
0:31:11|0:31:16|[Hao Liansheng] felt that something was wrong and hurried to [Lin Manli]'s house.
0:31:20|0:31:24|Seeing no one answering, he walked into the bedroom.
0:31:24|0:31:36|There was no bedroom, so he ran to another room to search.
0:31:36|0:31:43|Still, [Hao Liansheng] placed the cake on the coffee table, but accidentally knocked over the water glass. He trembled as he picked up the glass.
0:31:46|0:31:56|Hao Liansheng quickly walked to the kitchen, the only place left to search, and found Lin Manli's kitchen knife lying at the door.
0:31:56|0:32:6|[Hao Liansheng] stood up stiffly, fumbling to dial 120. His fingers were trembling slightly as he waited for the call to connect, his face filled with anxiety.
0:32:34|0:32:38|[Hao Liansheng] put down the phone nervously and walked towards the door.
0:32:38|0:32:43|Approaching the door, he suddenly thought about what would happen if he was discovered, hesitated for a moment, and then turned back.
0:32:43|0:32:47|He took out a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped the phone vigorously.
0:32:47|0:32:52|After wiping it, he put the phone down across the handkerchief, feeling a bit relieved, and prepared to leave.
0:32:55|0:33:1|After wiping again, he gently closed the door and left without helping up [Lin Manli] lying on the ground.
0:33:1|0:33:7|[Hao Liansheng] hurriedly paced back and forth, trying to maintain a calm expression on his face as he repeatedly pressed the elevator button, hoping she would come up quickly.
0:33:7|0:33:15|But at this moment, the sound of police sirens blared. He became even more flustered upon hearing it, and after a moment of contemplation, he hurried towards the stairs, moving as fast as he could without daring to stop for a moment.
0:33:18|0:33:23|After walking several more floors, [Hao Liansheng]'s footsteps became disordered and his speed was not as fast as before.
0:33:23|0:33:28|He was a little exhausted, his hand resting on the armrest as he struggled to go down a few more floors.
0:33:28|0:33:31|Finally, unable to hold on any longer, he sat directly on the steps.
0:33:31|0:33:34|This series of changes has left him mentally exhausted.
0:33:34|0:33:40|At this moment, a couple walked to the stairwell to take out the trash, and became cautious upon hearing the sound of police sirens outside.
0:34:1|0:34:13|Upon hearing these words, [Hao Liansheng] flashed through a few scenes in his mind: [Lin Manli] wielding a knife in the kitchen, the overturned water glass and cake on the coffee table, the woman he bumped into in the elevator, and the scene from when he just called the police.
0:34:18|0:34:21|Each incident made [Hao Liansheng] break out in a cold sweat.
0:34:38|0:34:44|[Hao Liansheng] quickly got on the car and left the scene. He arrived at the main street, still pondering over this matter in his mind.
0:34:50|0:34:53|As the lights come on, colorful neon lights intersect and respond to each other.
0:34:53|0:34:59|In the memory, that night was at the Rolling Stones Nightclub, where the lights were colorful, and the music was deafening.
0:34:59|0:35:4|A group of cool and handsome men and beautiful women danced wildly in the center of the dance floor to the strong classical music.
0:35:4|0:35:9|On stage, two sexy beauties are dancing passionately, lost in the music.
0:35:9|0:35:13|They are here to release their stress and freely express their passion for life.
0:35:13|0:35:16|At the nearby booth, [Hao Liansheng] is having a gathering with colleagues.
0:35:17|0:35:38|They were surrounded by a group of beautiful women, one of them was cutting fruit with a beautiful woman, another was toasting with a drink, while [Hao Liansheng] was staring straight at the dancing beauty, and [Lin Manli] sat beside him peeling peanuts for him.
0:35:38|0:35:40|On the other side, [Xiang Zhudan] is also here.
0:38:14|0:38:17|[Hao Liansheng] drinks three cups in a row following [Huahua].
0:38:17|0:38:21|[Huahua] fulfilled her promise to go on stage and sing, her sweet voice was very infectious.
0:38:42|0:38:50|[Lin Manli] pulled [Hao Liansheng] to the center of the stage, dancing along with [Huahua]'s singing. They stood face to face, very close to each other.
0:38:50|0:39:0|[Lin Manli] is very rhythmic, every move is on point, while [Hao Liansheng] is stiff all over, jumping without any method. On the side, [Liu Qingbiao] has a dazed look in his eyes, staring straight at them.
0:39:0|0:39:15|The singing gradually reached a climax, the men and women in the dance floor became more energetic, the atmosphere was very cheerful. [Liu Qingbiao] stared at [Huahua] with a playful smile, his eyes were like looking at prey, very greedy. He tilted his mouth, picked up the glass and drank it all in one gulp.
0:39:15|0:39:23|On the dance floor, as Pig Egg and Long-Haired Colleague danced happily, [Hao Liansheng] also entered a good state under the command of [Lin Manli]. However, soon he became exhausted and had to go rest.
0:39:40|0:39:45|[Lin Manli] helped him back to the seat, [Hao Liansheng] was exhausted and started panting heavily as soon as he sat down.
0:39:45|0:39:47|[Hao Liansheng] wipes the sweat with a tissue.
0:39:58|0:40:3|Abiao put down his glass and staggered over.
0:40:3|0:40:7|He leered at [Lin Manli] and headed straight towards her.
0:40:51|0:40:56|Hao Liansheng was pushed away by Abiao, and another person saw it and gave him a hard punch.
0:40:56|0:41:0|Abiao rushed towards his long-haired colleague in anger, and his sidekick also joined in the confrontation.
0:41:5|0:41:11|[Hao Liansheng] anxiously tried to dissuade from the side.
0:41:11|0:41:22|[Lin Manli] also shouted anxiously, but no one paid attention to them. Everyone just kept doing their own thing.
0:41:22|0:41:28|The colleague with long hair pushed a little lackey to the ground and picked up a beer bottle from the table to throw at someone.
0:41:32|0:41:34|[Hao Liansheng] is running back and forth persuading.
0:41:34|0:41:51|But everyone fought even more vigorously, pushing each other aside in a hurry. [Zhu Dan] kept picking up cans and throwing them forward, while [Meimei] exchanged a few moves with another follower. The follower got hit in the eye, grabbed a bottle and smashed it towards the opponent. [Liu Qingbiao]'s colleague fiercely punched the opponent's stomach, and the cans on the table were all thrown out.
0:41:51|0:41:54|[Zhudan] actually lifted the cake and threw it out.
0:41:54|0:41:55|[Lin Manli] throws another punch.
0:41:58|0:42:2|Everyone turned a deaf ear, as [Zhu Dan] smashed one small orange after another.
0:42:10|0:42:16|Everyone's eyes were red with anger. At this moment, someone landed a punch on [Hao Liansheng]'s face.
0:42:16|0:42:24|[Hao Liansheng] stood straight on the ground, chaos erupted in the venue, with both men and women joining the brawl.
0:42:24|0:42:30|[Huahua] was laughing with his mouth wide open when suddenly, his sidekick picked up a cake from the ground and threw it at him, landing directly in his mouth.
0:42:35|0:42:40|Abiao returns and tries to lift up his follower who is pressed on the ground, but gets his face smeared with cake.
0:42:40|0:42:46|He picked up a bottle on the side and caught up, only to have it smashed on the head of Hao Liansheng, who had just struggled to stand up.
0:42:46|0:42:49|[Hao Liansheng] was stunned, his eyes already unfocused.
0:42:49|0:42:51|The farce finally ended with [Hao Liansheng] being injured.
0:42:51|0:42:56|The next morning, he woke up in the hospital, with [Lin Manli] playing with flowers by his side.
0:44:23|0:44:26|[Lin Manli] suddenly stopped in her tracks, facing away from [Hao Liansheng].
0:44:34|0:44:38|After saying that, she walked out the door, leaving [Hao Liansheng] sitting on the bed pondering her words.
0:44:51|0:44:58|[Hao Liansheng] excitedly jumped out of bed, dancing with the flowers given by [Lin Manli]. At that moment, [Hao Zheng] and the others walked in.
0:45:2|0:45:8|[Hao Liansheng] was about to be exposed, so he sneakily took the vase from top to bottom, trying to pretend that he was using the vase for exercise.
0:45:8|0:45:14|Xiaomin frowned disapprovingly, as Hao Liansheng slowly turned around, set down the vase, and sat back on the bed.
0:45:14|0:45:19|[Hao Zheng] and [Xiaomin] hurried forward, with Xiaomin reaching out to feel his forehead.
0:45:38|0:45:44|[Hao Liansheng] slowly closed his eyes amidst the questioning of his children, walking out of this memory.
0:45:53|0:46:2|After making the decision, [Hao Liansheng] rushed home anxiously. At this moment, several police cars were parked downstairs in his building. Curious residents gathered around to see what was happening.
0:46:2|0:46:11|[Hao Liansheng] rushed home and was startled by the scene. He quickly parked the car, approached someone to inquire about the reason, with an expression of unease on his face.
0:46:25|0:46:35|[Hao Liansheng] walked to the side, stood on tiptoe and looked into the crowd. Suddenly, the image of Abiao flashed through his mind. When he was at [Lin Manli]'s house, he hurriedly ran out of the room, not even bothering to close the door.
0:46:43|0:46:46|[Hao Liansheng] came to a conclusion and then turned around to find Abiao.
0:46:46|0:46:49|He came to Abiao's restaurant, eating while waiting for him.
0:46:49|0:46:51|In the restaurant, a news report is playing on the television.
0:47:17|0:47:25|The person in the news bears a striking resemblance to [Hao Liansheng]. The woman sitting next to him instinctively looks at him, making [Hao Liansheng] feel uncomfortable, so he stands up.
0:47:38|0:47:56|[Hao Liansheng] glanced at the woman, sighed, and the woman and her friend whispered to each other. [Hao Liansheng] was momentarily at a loss, lowered his head in thought, and then spoke.
0:48:7|0:48:24|Hope was completely shattered, [Hao Liansheng] walked out of the restaurant in a daze. He walked alone on the street, the sky was already dark, with only him on the street. [Hao Liansheng] looked dejected, his back appearing very desolate. His face was twisted into a frown, showing a look of despair. His beautiful tie was now wrinkled and crooked on his collar.
0:49:1|0:49:11|[Hao Liansheng] once again fell into memories. On the 28th, [Lin Manli] was working in the office as usual, holding a brochure in her hand, comparing it carefully.
0:49:11|0:49:16|At the same time, [Hao Liansheng] walked into the office lobby with a smile on his face and his hands behind his back.
0:49:52|0:49:58|Mary is in his studio, he won't eat or drink as soon as he enters, and won't come out until the end of work.
0:49:59|0:50:5|[Hao Liansheng] took [Lin Manli]'s salary and walked towards his office.
0:50:5|0:50:9|He walked to the door and knocked.
0:50:11|0:50:14|[Lin Manli] dismisses the model and walks towards him happily.
0:50:26|0:50:32|[Hao Liansheng] followed [Lin Manli] into the office, where she handed him a paper cup and teased him.
0:50:39|0:50:43|The old man Shen Cai raised his hand and made an agreement.
0:50:45|0:50:47|[Lin Manli] took the envelope and looked inside.
0:51:1|0:51:4|[Lin Manli] shook her head, her expression darkening.
0:51:5|0:51:12|[Lin Manli] finished speaking and turned to leave, leaving [Hao Liansheng] looking shocked, unsure of how to comfort her.
0:51:12|0:51:18|After work, the two of them returned to [Lin Manli]'s home together. [Hao Liansheng] sat on the sofa while [Lin Manli] poured tea to serve him.
0:52:47|0:52:51|[Hao Liansheng] picked up the bag and walked quickly towards the door, but stopped at the doorway.
0:53:5|0:53:8|[Hao Liansheng] wanted to say something, but held back.
0:53:8|0:53:10|He smiled, nodded, and opened the door to walk out.
0:53:10|0:53:17|On New Year's Eve, [Hao Liansheng] sat alone on the sofa, smoking and watching the Lotus Gala.
0:53:17|0:53:26|The phone rang at this moment, and he impatiently got up and moved to the phone, bringing the ashtray with him.
0:53:41|0:53:44|Leaned back and took a deep drag of the cigarette.
0:53:44|0:53:46|But soon after, the phone rang again.
0:53:54|0:54:0|Hey, hey. He hung up the phone again, took a puff of his cigarette, then suddenly thought of something and picked up the phone to dial again.
0:54:58|0:55:1|[Hao Liansheng] hung up the phone and took a deep drag on his cigarette.
0:55:1|0:55:8|He looked at the clock on the wall, only three minutes left until midnight, the first day of the new year, destined for him to spend alone.
0:55:8|0:55:13|The ashtray on the table is full of cigarette butts, with only two cigarettes left in the pack.
0:55:13|0:55:18|The room was eerily quiet, with only a few lit lamps to prove that there were people in the house.
0:55:18|0:55:23|[Hao Liansheng] was restless at home, sitting on the sofa for a while and then getting up to pace around.
0:55:23|0:55:31|He had been thinking about someone all along. Just as he was about to sit down, the doorbell rang. Hao Liansheng put out his cigarette and quickly walked up to open the door.
0:57:13|0:57:18|Lin Manli slowly got up from the sofa at the sound of the voice, leaning against [Hao Liansheng].
0:57:18|0:57:22|Dressed in a bright short skirt, she now looks like a withered rose, very heart-wrenching.
0:57:38|0:57:47|As the countdown to the new year quietly arrives, on live television, various places have become a sea of joy at this moment, as people celebrate the arrival of the new year.
0:57:47|0:57:53|Drunk [Lin Manli] was overcome by drowsiness at this moment, her head slowly leaning towards [Hao Liansheng], resting on his shoulder as she fell into a light sleep.
1:0:19|1:0:24|[Hao Liansheng] sighed deeply and leaned against the public telephone, looking lost in thought.
1:0:24|1:0:27|At this moment, he especially missed the simple days in the past.
1:0:35|1:0:40|Hao Liansheng still didn't dare to go find [Meimei], and walked out of the door with a worried look on his face.
1:1:3|1:1:24|Hao Liansheng, who was wandering aimlessly on the street, was attracted by laughter. He panicked and forgot that it was his daughter. He hurriedly hid behind a stone table, feeling flustered for a moment.
1:1:24|1:1:30|The thug, feeling aggrieved, raised his hand to hit [Xiaomin], but was instead thrown over the shoulder by [Xiaomin] and slammed to the ground.
1:1:36|1:1:42|One person left was not convinced, and ended up being knocked down by her. Hao Liansheng stood by, smiling with satisfaction.
1:1:42|1:1:45|Seeing [Xiaomin] in this appearance, memories were pulled back to a few years ago.
1:6:19|1:6:23|Remembering that she used to be the idol of her daughter and his friends.
1:6:23|1:6:28|When recalling the things he had done during that time, [Hao Liansheng] felt ashamed.
1:6:28|1:6:33|He continued to walk on the street with a face full of regret, looking lifeless and wise.
1:6:33|1:6:36|His appearance was seen by two passersby, and they whispered to each other.
1:6:43|1:6:47|Hao Liansheng was completely unaware, still immersed in feelings of fear and sadness.
1:6:47|1:6:51|He walked dejectedly, his head hanging low, lost in his thoughts.
1:6:51|1:6:54|Tears welled up in his eyes.
1:6:54|1:6:57|He stopped, wiped away his tears, and made a decision.
1:7:1|1:7:6|He hurried forward, passing by a dessert shop, when suddenly several [doctors] rushed towards him.
1:7:21|1:7:29|Seeing [Hao Liansheng] struggling non-stop, the [doctor] injected him with a sedative. The liquid gradually entered his body, and [Hao Liansheng] calmed down, falling into a deep sleep.
1:7:29|1:7:32|In the dream, he once again arrived at [Lin Manli]'s house.
1:7:32|1:7:37|After the elevator reached the 13th floor, [Hao Liansheng] looked spirited as he took off his mask.
1:7:37|1:7:41|He straightened his suit, tidied his hair, with a spring in his step, looking very pleased with himself.
1:7:41|1:7:47|He bounced towards [Lin Manli]'s house, his steps light and even dancing joyfully.
1:7:47|1:7:50|[Hao Liansheng] walked to the door, only to see the door wide open.
1:7:51|1:8:10|We see Abiao chasing [Lin Manli] with a knife. He pushes her down onto the sofa. Hao Liansheng shouts out in alarm and rushes forward to grab the knife and stop him, but Abiao pushes him back onto the sofa with a swift move.
1:8:12|1:8:17|Abiao intended to stab her, but suddenly stopped and turned to stab [Lin Manli] behind him.
1:8:17|1:8:21|[Lin Manli] had nowhere to escape and was stabbed in the stomach by the knife.
1:8:21|1:8:25|The two looked at each other, [Lin Manli] exhausted, slid to the ground.
1:8:25|1:8:30|Abiao hesitated for a moment, then quickly ran away. After seeing her leave, [Hao Liansheng] struggled to get up and rescue [Lin Manli].
1:8:37|1:8:45|[Hao Liansheng] picked up the knife from the ground and examined it in his hand, when suddenly [Xiaomin] appeared at the door.
1:8:45|1:8:49|[Hao Liansheng] stood still, not knowing what to say in defense, as the knife slipped from her hand.
1:8:58|1:9:2|[Hao Liansheng] woke up from a dream and staggered out of the ward.
1:9:36|1:9:39|At this moment, [Xiaomin] is at home, feeling overwhelmed.
1:9:39|1:9:42|She paced back and forth in the living room, touching her hair nervously, unable to sit still.
1:9:42|1:9:47|She kept glancing at her phone, hoping for good news to bring her peace of mind.
1:10:42|1:10:45|At this moment, [Hao Liansheng] is still walking on the road.
1:10:51|1:11:10|[Hao Liansheng] stopped in his tracks, rolled up his sleeves to check the time. It was already 3 am. He let out a heavy sigh and was about to continue walking when a police car came towards him. [Hao Liansheng] panicked and quickly hid behind the car, not daring to move. After the police car drove away, he cautiously came out, breathing heavily.
1:11:12|1:11:19|[Hao Liansheng] hesitated for a moment, not sure which way to go, and finally decided to go left without hesitation.
1:11:29|1:11:42|[Hao Liansheng] took a few more steps forward and found that the buildings in the neighborhood looked blurry, each one resembling Ah Biao's house, but upon closer inspection, they were not.
1:11:42|1:11:48|[Hao Liansheng] looked around uncertainly, unable to make up his mind, so he could only continue walking forward.
1:11:54|1:12:9|A figure flashed past [Hao Liansheng], who looked around vigilantly.
1:12:9|1:12:15|[Hao Liansheng] was hit on the head by Abiao with a brick and fell to the ground.
1:12:45|1:12:49|The mother and daughter excitedly plan, while [Hao Liansheng] gets up and continues to wander the streets.
1:13:28|1:13:37|[Hao Liansheng] stood at the bridge looking at the rushing river, scenes of his arrest involuntarily flashing through his mind. With heavy shackles on his feet, he walked forward, preparing to face interrogation.
1:14:59|1:15:16|The scene in the fantasy is too terrifying. [Hao Liansheng] feels as if his heart has turned to ashes. He slowly raises his head and looks towards the brightly lit Pearl River Bridge not far away. In the moonlight, he stands out like a solitary tree. The Pearl River flows quietly under the bridge, with shimmering waves on the surface. However, such a beautiful night scene may never be seen by [Hao Liansheng] again in the future.
1:15:16|1:15:23|Thinking of this, he withdrew his gaze desolately and continued on his way. In the police station, [Hao Zheng] was interrogating.
1:15:31|1:15:38|Abiao didn't expect that [Hao Zheng] would be so polite. He took the cigarette from him with a look of disbelief, and [Hao Zheng] leaned in to help him light it.
1:15:38|1:15:48|Abiao took a deep breath and hesitantly asked.
1:15:48|1:15:56|Upon hearing this, [Liu Qingbiao] was overwhelmed with joy and tears. He let out a long sigh of relief, his tense heart finally settling down. Then, he explained with a face full of embarrassment.
1:16:57|1:17:11|The truth of the matter was revealed, but at this moment, [Hao Liansheng] was still unaware. He walked aimlessly on the Pearl River Bridge, finally leaning desolately on the railing. He lit another cigarette, the flame shining on his face, tears glistening in his eyes.
1:17:11|1:17:21|[Hao Liansheng] regrets deeply, but it's too late. He looks despairingly at the flowing river beneath his feet, various tragic outcomes have left him physically and mentally exhausted. At this moment, a terrifying thought crosses his mind.
1:18:46|1:18:49|Not long ago, I watched a foreign film called "Beauty Without Guilt".
1:19:13|1:19:20|These words pierced [Hao Liansheng]'s heart like needles, unable to live and unable to die, he despaired and hid by the bridge.
1:19:20|1:19:24|At this moment, he stared blankly, unsure of where to go from here.
1:19:28|1:19:30|Lost in thought, [Hao Liansheng] was interrupted by a police officer walking over.
1:19:42|1:19:53|[Hao Liansheng] woke up as if from a dream, he turned to look at the police, tears streaming down his eyes.
1:19:53|1:19:54|[Hao Liansheng] turned and walked away.
1:20:1|1:20:8|[Hao Liansheng] walked into the police station like a walking corpse, covered in dust with his hair sticking out in all directions.
1:21:24|1:21:37|[Hao Liansheng] heard this and was slightly stunned, then smiled. The tension that had been building up all night finally relaxed, and he sat down on the chair, feeling a bit embarrassed as he spoke.
1:21:37|1:21:45|[Hao Liansheng] wiped away the tears that had fallen, his face filled with the gratitude of surviving a disaster. After a night of twists and turns, he finally returned home.
1:22:8|1:22:21|After speaking, [Hao Liansheng] glanced guiltily at his wife, then slumped onto the sofa. [Meimei] walked over with a smile, holding a bowl, and helped him up.
1:22:21|1:22:24|[Meimei] held a bowl and fed [Hao Liansheng] bite by bite.
1:22:39|1:22:41|[Hao Liansheng] happily enjoys the care of his wife.
1:22:47|1:22:48|[Hao Liansheng] is too embarrassed to speak.
1:22:48|1:23:1|Hao Liansheng waited with his mouth wide open for his wife to feed him, his eyes dodging, secretly observing his wife's reaction.
1:23:1|1:23:7|[Hao Liansheng] took out the necklace he had originally intended to give to [Lin Manli] from his pocket and handed it to [Xiaomin].
1:24:19|1:24:26|Tan Xiaojuan, [Hao Liansheng]'s phone rang, and she didn't react immediately.
1:24:56|1:25:0|[Hao Liansheng] was stunned, his eyes wide open and his mouth agape, unable to say a word.
1:25:0|1:25:8|But this time, he no longer had those fanciful ideas, instead he continued to live a peaceful and content life with [Meimei].
1:25:8|1:25:12|At this moment, he is riding a bicycle with [Xiaomin] by the river.
1:25:12|1:25:21|[Lin Manli] has fully recovered. She is hiding in the studio again, still looking like a strong woman. In the end, everyone has found their own happiness.
