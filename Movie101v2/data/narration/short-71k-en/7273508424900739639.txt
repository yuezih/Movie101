0:0:35|0:0:55|In the distance, the mountains undulate like camel humps for miles. At this moment, a person is running up from the foot of the mountain. As he approaches, it can be seen that he has an ammunition box slung diagonally on his left side, a cloth bundle on his right side, and a rifle slung on his back. He is lean but strong.
0:0:55|0:1:0|Zhang Side is running fast among the mountains, with only him visible in the vast mountain ranges.
0:1:0|0:1:11|He quickened his pace, never stopping for a moment. After crossing another mountain, his movements became slower, but he didn't stop to rest, instead continuing to move forward.
0:1:11|0:1:18|The mountain road became increasingly difficult to traverse. Zhang Side increased the swinging force of his arms and lowered his center of gravity, but even so, he almost stumbled despite being careful.
0:1:18|0:1:25|He climbed up a steep slope using both hands and feet, with loose rocks constantly rolling down the cliff. Beads of sweat dripped from his forehead.
0:1:25|0:1:33|He looked into the distance to estimate how much further there was to go. At that moment, the camera zoomed in and focused on his face, revealing that the person was [Zhang Side].
0:1:33|0:1:50|At the same time, on the big stage, several children sat around chatting and laughing. They held peanuts and melon seeds in their hands. The little girl wore a big flowered jacket, with her hair tied into two small braids. The little boy wore new cloth shoes from home. The children all had innocent smiles on their faces.
0:1:54|0:1:58|[Zhang Side] was pushed onto the stage in a hurry with a curtain covering him.
0:3:8|0:3:21|[Zhang Side] is seen with bright eyes and an open mouth, singing passionately.
0:3:21|0:3:24|[Mao Zedong] listened with a look of admiration.
0:3:51|0:3:53|Liu Bingzhong rides on [Zhang Side]'s shoulders to repair the electric lamp.
0:3:58|0:4:17|[Mao Zedong] and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De were comically exaggerated in their actions by Xiao Bai.
0:4:17|0:4:23|At the end of the song, everyone excitedly applauded. During the evening break, Zhang Side went to take a bath, carrying a basin and walking into the kitchen from outside.
0:4:29|0:4:32|Xiao Bai sat on the kang and took off his shoes, looking defiant.
0:4:32|0:4:33|[Zhang Side] also returned from outside at this time.
0:5:43|0:5:53|Da Li extinguished the kerosene lamp, but [Zhang Side] did not go to sleep. He walked out of the room holding a bundle of straw and saw the old revolutionary grinding beans like a millstone. He wanted to walk over and help.
0:5:53|0:6:1|[Zhang Side] grabbed the handle, only to be slapped away by the old revolutionary. He grabbed it again, and was slapped away once more. The old revolutionary, in Western-style clothing, looked angry and even raised his hand to hit him.
0:6:1|0:6:7|[Zhang Side] no longer argued with him, smiled foolishly a few times, walked to the threshold and sat down, tidying up the straw in the moonlight.
0:6:8|0:6:11|He turned back to the old revolutionary, with clear eyes full of respect and admiration.
0:6:11|0:6:14|One morning, everyone gathered at the door. 
0:7:35|0:7:50|Chairman Mao finished speaking, turned and walked towards the car, while [Zhang Side] smiled foolishly, with admiration in his eyes.
0:7:50|0:7:57|The stolen car started slowly, and they arrived at the Liberation Daily office. A lot of people were standing in the small place. When they saw Chairman Mao getting off, everyone warmly applauded.
0:7:57|0:8:0|[Zhang Side] was the first to jump out of the car and escort the Chairman out.
0:8:9|0:8:16|Chairman Mao Zedong greeted the comrades warmly and kindly, some were playing the accordion, some were playing the erhu, it was quite lively.
0:8:16|0:8:21|After the inspection, the car drove on a mountain road.
0:9:13|0:9:17|[Zhang Side] quickly jumped out of the car, picked up Song Guangming, and placed him on a pile of grass by the side.
0:9:17|0:9:20|Although in a hurry, the movements were very gentle.
0:9:20|0:9:25|He helped [Song Guangming] take off his pants, then turned to take the paper from Auntie's hand, busy and bustling for a while.
0:9:29|0:9:33|[Zhang Side] is very patient with [Song Guangming], speaking in a very gentle tone.
0:9:33|0:9:39|He helped [Song Guangming] fold his pants and put them back in the car, then hurried back to his own position after everything was taken care of.
0:9:39|0:9:45|The car started slowly and headed towards the kindergarten, but Zhang Side's stomach was still uncomfortable, and soon it started to ache again.
0:9:45|0:9:49|[Qiu Yuemei] quickly stopped the car, while the other children inside the car shouted mockingly.
0:9:58|0:10:1|[Zhang Side] quickly opened the car door and carried [Song Zhuangmin] down.
0:10:1|0:10:14|They came to the river and carefully washed the children with the river water.
0:10:14|0:10:19|Being teased by [Qiu Yuemei] like this, [Zhang Side] couldn't help but just smile foolishly and continue washing the children.
0:10:19|0:10:21|The aunt was deeply moved when she saw this scene.
0:10:37|0:10:47|[Zhang Side] carefully dried Song Guangming with his clothes, then wrapped the clothes tightly around him, and took out some candy from his pocket.
0:10:47|0:10:55|Song Guangming shook his head, the female teachers were still washing his clothes by the river, [Zhang Side] played with him for a while, and the group set off again.
0:10:55|0:10:59|After the children arrived safely, [Zhang Side] promptly arrived in Yan'an.
0:10:59|0:11:8|In the bustling new market of Yan'an, Zhang Side is currently helping to unload goods at the warehouse in the southern area of the Military Service Society. Despite being covered in sweat, he is still full of energy.
0:11:8|0:11:17|He put the grain on the shelf, ready to leave, when Liu Bingzhong called him.
0:11:17|0:11:20|However, Zhang Side continued to transport the grain.
0:11:29|0:11:38|After the arrangements were made, Liu Bingzhong limped into the room. [Zhang Side], who had just finished unloading the goods, was also here. He scooped a cup of water from the water tank, Director Liu.
0:12:55|0:13:1|Zhang Side and Mao Zedong came with sugar balls to find Song Guangming.
0:14:16|0:14:19|Song Guangming didn't want to listen to his nagging and ran away angrily.
0:14:19|0:14:22|[Zhang Side] also didn't blame him, and got up to chase after him.
0:14:22|0:14:25|Liu Bingzhong turned around and saw that everyone had left, so he hurriedly got up and caught up.
0:14:25|0:14:28|Almost slipped and almost fell down.
0:14:28|0:14:31|[Zhang Side] holds Song Guangming, pointing to the galloping horse on the bridge.
0:14:31|0:14:33|The child's wrinkled face finally broke into a smile.
0:14:33|0:14:36|[Zhang Side] looked at him with eyes full of love.
0:14:36|0:14:38|It looks like a real father-son pair.
0:14:39|0:14:42|[Zhang Side] pacified the children and then started to get busy with work.
0:14:42|0:14:46|They drove along the mountain road, responsible for escorting the Chairman.
0:14:46|0:14:50|In the middle of the road, the car suddenly stalled and couldn't move forward.
0:14:50|0:14:56|[Zhang Side] quickly jumped out of the car, squatted down to check, and his comrades also got out of the car to help.
0:14:56|0:15:0|[Zhang Side] looked nervous and quickly went to the back seat to get a bucket of water.
0:15:2|0:15:6|Chairman Mao Zedong also came out at this time, holding a cigarette in his hand and smoking as he walked.
0:15:6|0:15:10|He fired randomly around him and finally stood in front of the car, gazing into the distance.
0:15:20|0:15:23|Zhang Side and Mao Zedong walked ahead one after the other, with the squad leader quickly catching up.
0:15:23|0:15:28|At the same time, Zhang Side has filled the water and is running back quickly.
0:15:42|0:15:54|[Zhang Side], come, the Chairman hands the things to the squad leader, squat down slowly and drink the water with your hands.
0:17:8|0:17:13|[Zhang Side] was pleasantly surprised as he took the blind chicken handed to him by Chairman Mao.
0:17:37|0:17:42|Soon, Chairman Mao Zedong and his entourage arrived at the destination, where the soldiers had already lined up in formation, ready to be reviewed.
0:17:42|0:17:47|The car slowly drove in, [Zhang Side] opened the door, and Wang Beard was already waiting in front of the car.
0:17:50|0:17:58|Chairman Mao Zedong got off the car, shook hands with the leader Wang Huzi, then waved cheerfully to the soldiers, applause filled the air, everyone was very excited.
0:17:58|0:18:11|The reporter walked at the front taking photos, while Chairman Mao Zedong smiled and clapped along with everyone, slowly entering the factory. On the sign at the entrance, Zhang Side personally wrote more than ten large characters.
0:18:42|0:18:53|Chairman Ren Bishi, Wang Huzi, and Zhang Side went to discuss work. At this time, Zhang Side was working hard to wash the car. Lao Cao and others opened the hood of the car to further investigate the car's issues, and the squad leader came to bring them food.
0:19:11|0:19:14|The lively cheering ahead caught the attention of [Zhang Side].
0:19:14|0:19:17|At the foot of the mountain, Zhang Side and Mao Zedong are currently competing in grass digging.
0:19:17|0:19:20|Xiao Bai gradually became physically exhausted, and his speed gradually slowed down.
0:19:20|0:19:23|She threw away the helmet, sat down on the ground with a weak and powerless body.
0:19:40|0:19:44|Zhang Side threw down his backpack, took off his hat, and started digging the ground with a pickaxe.
0:19:44|0:19:53|On the side, Zhang Side, unwilling to be outdone, lifted his straw hat and prepared to compete, his movements quick and forceful. Xiao Bai stood by, shouting words of encouragement as if facing life and death.
0:19:53|0:19:56|[Zhang Side] nervously looked towards them, not even caring about his meal.
0:19:56|0:20:0|But not long after, Zhang Side also couldn't continue, he angrily threw down his weapon and withdrew from the competition.
0:20:3|0:20:8|[Zhang Side] ran over to them with food still in his mouth.
0:20:8|0:20:14|[Zhang Side] walked while loosening his clothes. He used his foot to hook the corpse's head, regardless of whether there were people around, and started digging directly.
0:20:14|0:20:24|The rapid movements one after another quickly dispelled the frustration of Dali and Xiaobai. The surrounding soldiers slowly stood up, looking at [Zhang Side] with eyes full of disbelief.
0:20:24|0:20:30|The land became softer under the excavation of [Zhang Side], with his determined gaze and increasingly faster movements, everyone couldn't help but cheer.
0:21:17|0:21:21|[Zhang Side] felt weak in the legs, Xiaobai and Dali quickly drove him back.
0:21:21|0:21:28|A group of people set off from here, the roof of the car is full of food, including flour, pork, watermelon, and all kinds of things.
0:21:28|0:21:32|The main flag sat in the passenger seat, smiling and enjoying the scenery outside the window.
0:21:32|0:21:41|Their purpose of this trip is the Central Hospital, where injured soldiers can be seen everywhere. With the support of medical staff, they can barely walk, while the severely injured can only lie on stretchers.
0:21:41|0:21:46|The car stopped at the hospital entrance, with [Zhang Side] and Dali carrying a door of pork and a bag of fruits ready to go in.
0:21:52|0:21:57|The two looked over and saw the wounded soldier on the stretcher gritting his teeth in agony.
0:22:2|0:22:8|After completing the mission, everyone returned to their residence, only to see [Zhang Side] and a few others wiping the military flag on the stone table at the door.
0:22:8|0:22:11|Xiao Bai just finished washing clothes, [Zhang Side] is carrying a basin of cement, preparing to repair the roof.
0:22:21|0:22:27|[Zhang Side] carefully climbs up the ladder to patch up the hole. Outside the door, the leader and the guards pass through the mountain path.
0:22:27|0:22:45|Walking quickly towards the courtyard, they saw the leader approaching. Everyone stopped their activities and stood up to salute and greet them. The leader responded warmly to each one, but did not stop walking. They walked straight towards a room, and everyone was very curious about this posture. Zhang Side and his comrades kept glancing over there, all wanting to know what wind had blown the leader here.
0:22:46|0:22:53|The two leaders walked into a house, followed closely by the guards who closed the door. [Zhang Side] and others ran to the window of the house to eavesdrop.
0:22:53|0:22:57|In the room, [Zhang Side] stood solemnly by the bed, while the guard officer diligently recorded.
0:23:15|0:23:18|[Zhang Side] stopped his men and looked in their direction.
0:23:18|0:23:21|The guard wrote down the message on a piece of paper and handed it to [Zhang Side] to read.
0:23:21|0:23:26|The old revolutionary looked anxious, wanting to say something, but he was disabled and unable to speak.
0:23:39|0:23:46|Upon hearing this, Zhang Side, the old revolutionary, burst into tears. Seeing him like this, Chairman Mao Zedong dismissed the eavesdroppers outside the door and had to give up for the time being.
0:23:46|0:23:53|He snatched the notebook from the guard's hand, wrote a big word "fool" on it, and left happily next to the meal on the table.
0:23:53|0:24:1|The next day, Chairman Mao Zedong went to the senior cadres' club by car. When the car stopped, Zhang Side immediately jumped out of the car, escorted the Chairman, and blocked the crowd behind him.
0:24:10|0:24:12|At this moment, [Zhang Side] is rushing to find Liu Bingzhou.
0:25:6|0:25:10|[Zhang Side] picked up the glasses placed on the table by Liu Bingzhong and gestured on his face.
0:26:22|0:26:29|[Zhang Side] turned a deaf ear and quickly ran out of the convenience store. He went to the cafeteria and brought back two bowls of rice, carefully entering the room of the old revolutionary.
0:26:29|0:26:38|The old revolutionary was sitting by the kang smoking a pipe. When he saw him coming, he quickly rolled up the tobacco pouch and lay down on his side. [Zhang Side] saw this and started to persuade him.
0:26:38|0:26:47|The old revolutionary, like he hadn't heard anything, didn't even look at him.
0:26:47|0:26:50|Zhang Side and Mao Zedong were late until the dinner bell rang.
0:26:50|0:26:54|The old revolutionary Zhang Side sat in front of the mill as usual, starting to grind soy milk.
0:26:54|0:26:57|[Zhang Side] walked out of the room and snatched the handle of the stone mill.
0:26:57|0:26:59|The old revolutionary refused to let go in anxiety.
0:27:10|0:27:13|[Zhang Side] understood his intention and was about to speak to persuade him.
0:27:13|0:27:15|The old revolutionary stood up and sat at the doorway.
0:27:15|0:27:18|[Zhang Side] looked at him blankly, unsure of what to do.
0:27:30|0:27:34|[Zhang Side] slowly stood up and felt helpless seeing the old revolutionary in such a state.
0:27:34|0:27:40|After calming down, Zhang Side, the old revolutionary, started sewing, but his eyes were already blurry, and he couldn't thread the needle for a long time.
0:27:40|0:27:45|[Zhang Side] took the glasses that Liu Bingzhong had taken in the morning and put them on the old revolutionary.
0:27:45|0:27:50|Zhang Side stood still in place, momentarily unable to react as the thread suddenly passed through the needle's eye, making everything clear before his eyes.
0:27:50|0:27:56|He looked up excitedly at [Zhang Side], expressing the joy of being able to see clearly, and laughed with his mouth wide open.
0:27:57|0:28:9|The old revolutionary continued his work, while [Zhang Side] went to the side to turn the dial. [Zhang Side] watched him easily thread the line, laughing happily. The old revolutionary patted him, trying to convey something, but [Zhang Side] didn't understand.
0:28:9|0:28:17|He gestured again, but [Zhang Side] still didn't get it. So the old revolutionary picked up the chalk used for making clothes nearby, drew on the wall, and called him over to take a look.
0:28:18|0:28:22|The old revolutionary, Zhang Side, was seen drawing with great seriousness, stroke by stroke.
0:28:22|0:28:27|After finishing the drawing, he put the chalk in his pocket and then explained the meaning of the painting to [Zhang Side].
0:28:27|0:28:31|He pointed at the wall with his fingers, then pointed at his own heart, and then stomped his feet while speaking forcefully.
0:28:31|0:28:38|[Zhang Side] understood his meaning, he smiled slightly, after a moment of contemplation, he pulled up a stool, picked up a stone, and began to draw.
0:28:38|0:28:42|He drew a big circle, and the old revolutionary patted his chest, indicating that this was himself.
0:28:43|0:28:53|[Zhang Side] then wrote the three characters "Yan Anjia" in the circle, the old revolutionary nodded and raised his thumb. [Zhang Side] gestured for him to continue reading, and then he wrote down the word "son".
0:28:53|0:29:7|The old revolutionary looked puzzled when he saw [Zhang Side], who had been taking care of him all along. He had some doubts and a possible answer emerged in his mind, but he dared not confirm it. After all, he was already old, with the army repeatedly urging him to retire, and he couldn't speak for himself.
0:29:7|0:29:14|He really couldn't figure out why [Zhang Side] would want to be his son. He pointed to the two characters anxiously, looking hopefully at [Zhang Side].
0:29:25|0:29:33|The old revolutionary repeated the words in disbelief. After receiving confirmation from [Zhang Side], he put down the fabric in his hand, stood up excitedly, and grabbed him.
0:29:33|0:29:40|He still couldn't believe it, [Zhang Side] pressed on, with a firm tone, the old revolutionary was momentarily at a loss for what to do in his joy.
0:29:40|0:29:44|He thought for a moment, then walked quietly to the head of the bed. When he came back, he carefully held a handful of red dates in his hand.
0:29:45|0:29:58|[Zhang Side] stood still, not knowing what was going on. The old revolutionary reminded him to catch it, then put a red date in his hand and fed him another one into his mouth. Seeing him eat it, the old revolutionary clapped happily, encouraged Side by patting his shoulder, and then hurriedly left.
0:29:58|0:30:11|[Zhang Side] stared at the red dates in his hand, all saved by the old revolutionary and now given to him just because he was his son. Tears kept rolling in his eyes.
0:30:11|0:30:15|[Zhang Side] slowly lifted his head, his eyes filled with determination. He must do better for the old revolutionaries.
0:30:16|0:30:30|As time passed day by day, on days without tasks, [Zhang Side] remained busy. He would occasionally visit the kindergarten to see his godson Song Guangming. Not only that, he also found time to bathe the horse, give the squad leader a haircut, and even play the harmonica to cultivate his sentiment.
0:30:30|0:30:36|Song Guangming became more cheerful with his companion Zhang Side, and the environment in the courtyard was also tidied up by him.
0:30:36|0:30:41|In his spare time, he would pick up a bundle of straw and sit in the field to weave straw shoes for his comrades.
0:30:41|0:30:43|Even if the clothes were soaked with sweat, there was no stopping.
0:30:43|0:30:47|The large choir of the troops continued, with [Zhang Side] still singing with full force.
0:30:47|0:30:52|In daily training, [Zhang Side] always takes the lead and charges ahead, making his days very fulfilling.
0:31:32|0:31:45|On the basketball court, everyone is playing a game, with people chasing each other and trying to block each other with outstretched arms.
0:31:45|0:31:59|As the opponent approached the basket for a quick layup, Zhang Side made a powerful block to stop the ball, then passed it to Xiao Bai. Xiao Bai passed it to Mao Zedong, but Mao Zedong stopped in the middle of the court with the ball in his hands, took a shot, but missed the opportunity as the ball didn't go in.
0:32:5|0:32:9|[Zhang Side] wiped the sweat off his forehead, sneakily climbed over the wall, and ran to pick up the ball.
0:32:9|0:32:13|Other people ran over to watch, but he ran far away and still couldn't find the ball.
0:32:13|0:32:15|Da Li couldn't bear it anymore and blamed Xiao Bai.
0:32:32|0:32:34|[Zhang Side] ran out to help Aunt Guan chase the pig.
0:32:55|0:33:0|The pig ran into the river, and [Zhang Side] followed, exerting great effort to finally catch the pig.
0:33:0|0:33:11|At the same time, Zhang Side came out of the small shop, but his hands were tied with a rope, followed by two soldiers, he hung his head and looked serious.
0:33:11|0:33:18|He walked forward with a limp, deliberately distancing himself from two people, not wanting the passersby to see any clues.
0:33:18|0:33:21|[Zhang Side] was carrying a pig to take it home, and on the way, he saw [Liu Bingzhong].
0:33:52|0:33:57|Without waiting for [Liu Bingzhong] to answer, he was urged to hurry up. [Zhang Side] felt something was wrong and hurriedly stopped him.
0:33:57|0:34:6|[Liu Bingzhong] walked further and further away, while [Zhang Side] anxiously handed the porridge to an old man.
0:34:6|0:34:12|[Zhang Side] didn't have time to explain, so he quickly ran forward, trying to take a shortcut in the alley to catch up with [Liu Bingzhong].
0:34:12|0:34:18|The alley twisted and turned, and Zhang Side finally caught up, panting and anxiously asking questions.
0:35:42|0:35:44|[Liu Bingzhong] said to [Zhang Side] with a tearful voice.
0:35:44|0:35:47|After saying that, he turned around and left without looking back.
0:35:47|0:35:53|[Zhang Side] was stunned to hear this, he looked at [Liu Bingzhong], still unable to believe that he would do such a thing.
0:35:53|0:35:58|He walked to the wall like a zombie and slowly slid down to the ground.
0:35:58|0:36:10|As the night fell, the squad leader walked past the stables with a bamboo basket in his hand. He took a look inside and saw [Zhang Side] rubbing the horse's belly. He dropped the bamboo basket and walked in, calling out tentatively.
0:36:25|0:36:32|[Zhang Side] didn't know how to respond, so he quickened his movements to conceal his sorrowful emotions.
0:36:32|0:36:34|The squad leader walked up to him, squatted down, and asked again.
0:36:34|0:36:41|[Zhang Side] slowed down his movements, used the horse to stand up, took a few steps forward, tears already streaming down his face.
0:36:41|0:36:45|He wiped away his tears with his sleeve, and after a day of endurance, he finally broke down.
0:36:45|0:36:48|He tried to speak several times, but tears choked him and he couldn't say a word.
0:37:13|0:37:16|He turned around, and finally squatted down in despair, holding the horse and crying bitterly.
0:37:23|0:37:29|The squad leader saw him in such great pain, walked over slowly, and patted his back to comfort him.
0:37:29|0:37:33|[Zhang Side] cried even harder, as if trying to release all the negative emotions.
0:37:33|0:37:37|One day, [Zhang Side] was picking herbs with the Chairman.
0:37:56|0:38:2|Chairman Zhang Side put down the magnifying glass, wanting to smoke, but the cigarette box was empty. He had to give up and stood up to walk around.
0:38:2|0:38:7|The Chairman picked up the cigarette on the table, and [Zhang Side] opened the lighter smoothly.
0:39:25|0:39:29|The Chairman handed the water cup to [Zhang Side], his face serious as he contemplated.
0:40:9|0:40:17|[Zhang Side] still couldn't think of any of his own strengths. Seeing him so troubled, Chairman Mao didn't press further and instead handed him a letter.
0:40:44|0:41:1|After receiving the mission, [Zhang Side] immediately set off. He ran all the way, not even stopping when encountering rivers. His steps were swift as if he had motors under his feet. After running for a distance, he felt a bit tired and rested by walking fast, but soon started running again. His only thought was to complete the task assigned by Chairman Mao as quickly as possible.
0:41:3|0:41:9|The distance between the two places is not close, but [Zhang Side] arrived at the doorstep of the Liberation Army Daily soon because of his speed.
0:41:15|0:41:20|[Zhang Side] delivered the letter on time, and the newspaper staff quickly turned its contents into a newspaper.
0:41:21|0:41:32|Zhu De's speeches, Chairman Mao's speeches at the Yan'an Forum, and a series of initiatives and documents were all printed, greatly boosting the morale of everyone in the later stage of the War of Resistance against Japan.
0:41:32|0:41:36|At night, everyone gathered to watch a movie.
0:41:55|0:41:59|The squad leader walked over and took over to crank the engine for [Zhang Side].
0:41:59|0:42:6|[Zhang Side] picked up the cup and drank it all, then happily ran to watch the movie. When there was no seat available, he squeezed in by the door and watched with great enthusiasm.
0:42:6|0:42:15|The interpreter held the microphone, translating word by word, staring at the screen intently, afraid of missing a single sentence. The audience watched very attentively, cherishing this hard-won entertainment activity.
0:42:15|0:42:18|Song Guangming is also there, sitting very obediently on Qiu Yuemei's lap.
0:42:22|0:42:28|Everyone was amused by the plot twists in the movie, bursting into laughter.
0:42:28|0:42:35|But at this moment, someone in the film pulled out a gun and fired at the newcomers. Zhang Side's face changed drastically, covering his ears and bursting into tears.
0:43:22|0:43:28|In the blink of an eye, winter arrives, and two lines of people holding flowers are seen walking towards the venue in an orderly manner.
0:43:28|0:43:33|In the venue, many people gathered here, applauding warmly, ready to listen to the speech of [Mao Zedong].
0:43:59|0:44:3|After the speech, the banquet officially began, with a lively and bustling atmosphere.
0:44:3|0:44:6|[Mao Zedong] walked down the stage, holding a glass of wine to celebrate with everyone.
0:44:12|0:44:20|[Zhang Side] is washing a car outside the door at this moment, and the squad leader runs out of the venue to find him.
0:44:20|0:44:25|The squad leader threw away the rag in his hand and dragged him towards the meeting place, not giving him any room to refuse.
0:45:1|0:45:6|[Zhang Side] drank too much alcohol for Chairman Mao, and was supported by comrades to walk back to the camp.
0:45:27|0:45:31|Xiao Bai and Dali ride on with [Zhang Side].
0:45:31|0:45:36|[Zhang Side] staggered, even with someone supporting him, he almost stumbled and fell, prompting the squad leader to ask.
0:45:48|0:45:51|As a result, [Zhang Side] vomited all over the squad leader.
0:45:51|0:45:55|The next morning, sobering up from the alcohol, [Zhang Side] arrived at the Lu Xun Lanfeng Literature Institute.
0:45:55|0:45:59|The building has three stories high, and the design of the large pointed roof is very artistic.
0:45:59|0:46:5|[Zhang Side] walked through the gate, but as he entered the classroom, the scene before him left him speechless.
0:46:5|0:46:9|In the art classroom, the model in military uniform with two braids stood on the stage.
0:46:9|0:46:13|In the audience, the painters sketched out his appearance stroke by stroke.
0:46:13|0:46:14|Further in is the dance studio.
0:46:15|0:46:19|The girls hold onto the handrails, practicing their basic skills with movements that are neat and graceful.
0:46:19|0:46:22|[Zhang Side] looked a bit uncomfortable and subconsciously straightened his clothes.
0:46:22|0:46:29|In the music classroom, the orchestra is rehearsing, with someone playing the erhu, someone playing the pipa, and someone playing the violin.
0:46:29|0:46:35|The variety of musical instruments, blending Eastern and Western styles, left [Zhang Side] unsure where to look for a moment.
0:46:35|0:46:38|At this moment, the choir's singing started, harmonious and melodious.
0:46:38|0:46:44|Under the singing of "We Are Red Soldiers," led by [Zhang Side] and [Mao Zedong], the audience's hearts surged with excitement and blood boiled.
0:46:44|0:46:47|Zhang Side and Mao Zedong dance together in pairs, creating a warm and cozy atmosphere.
0:46:47|0:46:51|Although they are engaged in different occupations, everyone is very dedicated.
0:46:51|0:46:56|They rehearsed diligently, hoping to relieve the soldiers' pressure through their performances.
0:46:56|0:47:1|In the courtyard, [Mao Zedong] is ringing the end-of-work bell. In the end, he still follows the arrangement of the army and retires to this place.
0:47:1|0:47:4|[Zhang Side] quietly came up behind him and covered his eyes.
0:47:4|0:47:10|[Mao Zedong] turned around and saw him, very happy.
0:47:10|0:47:12|[Mao Zedong] pulled [Zhang Side] and walked towards the dormitory.
0:47:15|0:47:22|[Mao Zedong] was dressed in a brand new thick cotton coat, the fatigue in his eyes swept away. It was clear without asking that he was doing well.
0:47:22|0:47:30|In the dormitory, [Zhang Side] was tidying up the kitchen while [Mao Zedong] was sewing, leaning back on the bed at some point and falling asleep.
0:47:30|0:47:42|He sat on the edge of the bed, brushing off the dust on his hands. A variety of snacks were laid out beside him. He picked up a red date and put it in his mouth. Seeing Mao Zedong's eyes drooping, he leaned in to gently support him.
0:47:42|0:47:44|[Mao Zedong] was awakened by this movement, and the two smiled at each other.
0:47:49|0:47:56|After returning from the literary college, [Zhang Side] hurriedly went to stand guard without stopping, with heavy snow falling like goose feathers, but [Zhang Side] showed no signs of slackening.
0:47:56|0:48:2|In the late night, the squad leader came to change shifts. He walked towards [Zhang Side] with his head held high and stood in front of him.
0:48:11|0:48:16|[Zhang Side] quietly entered the Chairman's room carrying a charcoal bucket, only to find the desk piled high with documents.
0:48:16|0:48:23|Chairman Mao is writing an article at this moment, while [Zhang Side] carefully closes the door and walks towards the stove, adding more charcoal inside.
0:50:7|0:50:16|After getting off work in the morning, [Zhang Side] walked briskly on the road, while a group of children were playing in the alley.
0:50:16|0:50:19|The sound of firecrackers is continuous, and the atmosphere of the New Year becomes stronger.
0:50:19|0:50:24|[Zhang Side] arrived at the prison, his lips were white from the cold, and his fingers were numb.
0:50:24|0:50:29|Taking advantage of the guard opening the door, he yawned into the horn in his hand, while his eyes scanned the area back and forth.
0:51:38|0:51:42|Liu Bingzhong, with disheveled hair and tattered clothes, looked dispirited.
0:51:42|0:51:48|[Zhang Side] couldn't bear to see him like this, so after coming out of prison, he thought it over and decided to help him.
0:51:48|0:51:53|He arrived at the factory where Geng Yuqiu worked, handed his pass to the security guard, and quickly walked inside.
0:51:53|0:51:59|In the factory, everyone is busy. [Zhang Side] finds the factory manager and asks him about Geng Yuqiu's situation.
0:52:18|0:52:22|He remained silent, often bringing him to [Mao Zedong]'s workspace.
0:52:22|0:52:26|He had just moved back with a few large boxes and was filling the hand grenade with explosives.
0:52:26|0:52:29|He is meticulous and not influenced at all by the people around him.
0:52:36|0:52:41|The two of them came to the courtyard, with [Mao Zedong] standing on one side, head down, fingers nervously twisted together.
0:52:41|0:52:48|[Zhang Side] was also a bit nervous, constantly adjusting his sleeves, unable to say a word for a long time, the two stood facing each other at the front door.
0:53:46|0:53:48|Zhang Side was the first one to stand up.
0:54:4|0:54:9|[Mao Zedong] ran away crying after saying this, leaving [Zhang Side] standing there at a loss.
0:55:4|0:55:6|The front show of the Front Sky Team is playing at the back.
0:55:48|0:55:55|[Zhang Side] was about to discuss the performance with Qiu Lemei, but when he turned his head, she was not there. He looked out the window and saw her on a date with Wang Changling.
0:55:55|0:56:4|[Zhang Side] wanted to take a few more looks, but at this moment the performance ended. He turned back and clapped, walked through the crowd happily towards [Zhang Side].
0:56:13|0:56:19|[Zhang Side] holds Song Guangming on his lap, takes out the chocolate given to him by [Mao Zedong] from his pocket, and feeds it to the child.
0:56:19|0:56:24|Outside the window, Qiu Yuemei and [Zhang Side] embraced and kissed, while [Zhang Side] quickly covered Song Guangming's eyes.
0:56:24|0:56:30|At this moment, other children gathered around, leaning on the windowsill, sharing the happiness of Teacher Qiu.
0:56:31|0:56:40|After the Spring Festival, Li Dingming came to Yan'an to attend a symposium. The Chairman was very happy to see his close friend and presented a plaque named "Old Star" to expand production.
0:56:40|0:56:46|The soldiers began to learn how to operate spinning wheels. They sat on the ground in the courtyard, each with a machine in hand, learning in an orderly manner. 
0:56:46|0:56:59|The snow and ice melt away, and it's spring again. In front of the barracks, the big trees are sprouting new buds. By the riverbank, everyone forms several large circles to play social games. [Zhang Side] and his classmates continue to practice singing together, with Xiao Bai conducting in the front, very precise and formal.
0:56:59|0:57:10|Qiu Yuemei and a few female teachers gathered together, chatting and laughing, discussing hairstyles in front of the mirror. The kindergarten children are performing on stage, with Zhang Side standing in the middle looking much more cheerful than last year.
0:57:10|0:57:16|The Liberation Daily is preparing to take a photo of [Mao Zedong]. The Chairman is sitting on a rattan chair, holding a newspaper in his hand, with a very kind and gentle smile on his face.
0:57:16|0:57:20|Wang Changling came back from outside, the horse hadn't even been tied up yet, and he went to find Qiu Yuemei.
0:57:20|0:57:25|Qiu Yuemei ran out, with a shy face, the activities in the army were rich, and the days of the choir performance arrived.
0:57:25|0:57:30|[Zhang Side] moved from the last row to the first row, but his mouth was still the widest open.
0:57:30|0:57:35|In the wrestling match, the pair [Zhang Side] and [Mao Zedong] cooperated seamlessly and achieved victory.
0:57:35|0:57:41|In the tug-of-war competition, the two teams couldn't determine the winner for half a day. [Zhang Side] exerted all his strength in one pull, and at the moment of victory, the rope stopped towards their side.
0:57:41|0:57:44|After the game, everyone sat around weaving straw shoes together.
0:57:44|0:57:47|[Zhang Side] patiently guides his inexperienced comrades.
0:57:47|0:57:53|During daily training, the soldiers are very serious, each one striving to be the first and fearing to fall behind others.
0:57:53|0:57:58|Before we know it, the harvest season has arrived, and everyone's face is filled with the joy of a bountiful harvest.
0:57:58|0:58:4|[Zhang Side] and his comrades were working in the fields, the sun shining down on them causing sweat to pour down their backs, but everyone was extremely happy.
0:58:4|0:58:8|Chairman Mao Zedong rubbed off the microphone and saw the strict and full of selling people inside, blooming a smile.
0:58:9|0:58:14|In mid-June, with the situation in the northwest becoming critical, over 40,000 soldiers and civilians from Yan'an packed their bags and set off to provide support.
0:58:14|0:58:19|The war is over, and everyone is gathered around listening to [Wang Changling] tell a story.
0:58:34|0:58:37|At the same time, [Zhang Side] is running frantically in the pouring rain.
0:58:37|0:58:40|He didn't carry an umbrella, just draped a large piece of plastic sheet.
0:58:54|0:58:57|The room was filled with joy, everyone was laughing heartily.
0:58:57|0:59:2|[Zhang Side] was walking through a muddy area at this moment, which was already slippery and downhill.
0:59:2|0:59:4|He made it down safely after being careful all the way.
0:59:4|0:59:10|[Zhang Side] was afraid of getting his clothes dirty, so he ran all the way barefoot. Finally, he ran to the barracks, and his clothes were completely soaked.
0:59:10|0:59:12|He walked into the room, where everyone was packing up.
0:59:38|0:59:42|[Zhang Side] was at a loss for a moment, and [Wang Changling] also looked regretful.
1:0:26|1:0:29|[Wang Changling] saluted everyone and then hurriedly left.
1:0:29|1:0:34|[Zhang Side] couldn't calm down for a long time, and slowly walked towards the kang.
1:0:35|1:0:37|Everyone remained silent, their faces full of anger.
1:0:40|1:0:43|Fortunately, Wang Changling had not gone far, and [Zhang Side] caught up with him in a few steps.
1:0:43|1:0:47|He ran straight to the Chairman's office with Wang Changling, hoping to try his luck again.
1:0:47|1:0:52|He certainly hoped that he could return safely, but on the battlefield where swords have no eyes, [Zhang Side] dared not take any risks.
1:0:52|1:0:55|He was afraid that Wang Changling would really sacrifice himself, and he would never have the chance again but he wished.
1:0:57|1:1:4|Seeing no response, [Zhang Side] lifted the curtain and looked inside.
1:1:4|1:1:10|Wang Changling looked firmly at the cave, raised his right arm on his neck and saluted slowly.
1:1:10|1:1:17|[Zhang Side] wiped the rain off his face and looked at the captain standing in the rain as if it were nothing. His eyes were full of admiration for Chairman Mao.
1:1:24|1:1:33|Although he didn't meet Chairman Mao in person, Wang Changling was already satisfied. He warmly thanked [Zhang Side], who felt a bit embarrassed and thought he didn't deserve such gratitude.
1:1:33|1:1:48|Chairman, who has just returned from Qingliang Mountain, is setting off again without a moment's rest. Although [Mao Zedong] could sit in the car, he prefers to stand on the rear footboard. As the car passes over the bridge, three soldiers are transporting grain on camels, and the sound of the camel bells is very pleasant to the ears.
1:1:48|1:1:57|The vehicle arrived at the market, where it was bustling with people. The common folks leisurely strolled around, weaving in and out of small vendors, looking to purchase the most cost-effective goods.
1:1:57|1:2:6|At the market gate, slogans calling for the expulsion of Japanese invaders are posted. The victory of the War of Resistance against Japan is just one year away, and the people's lives are becoming more comfortable.
1:2:8|1:2:13|Chairman's car drove through the crowd, but suddenly the car swayed from side to side and then stopped.
1:2:13|1:2:17|The soldiers hurriedly got off the car to check.
1:2:17|1:2:22|Chairman Mao Zedong got off the car, walked to the deflated tire, and sighed at the unreliable vehicle.
1:2:22|1:2:32|He took out his watch, glanced at the time approaching, his expression becoming more serious.
1:2:33|1:2:34|Chairman Mao Zedong's gaze was drawn, and he walked forward.
1:2:47|1:2:56|[Zhang Side], [Zhang Side] quickly immersed himself in repairing cars, while Chairman Mao strolled through the market, enjoying the lively atmosphere on the streets and gradually feeling more at ease.
1:2:56|1:3:2|He walked up to the pumpkin stall and casually picked up one that was slightly tilted. The pumpkins were all plump and in excellent condition.
1:3:4|1:3:5|He picked up a handful and examined it carefully.
1:4:2|1:4:4|People in the team.
1:4:19|1:4:24|Xiao Bai took out money and handed it to the old man. Seeing this, the old man added a lot of red dates into the scale.
1:4:32|1:4:39|The old man poured red dates into the cloth bag, Xiao Bai picked it up and left. At this moment, a passerby recognized [Mao Zedong].
1:4:48|1:4:57|After some twists and turns, [Mao Zedong] finally arrived at the meeting venue.
1:4:57|1:5:5|[Mao Zedong] walked to the front of the stage after shaking hands with Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and others, and warmly greeted the residents below with a friendly hello.
1:5:5|1:5:13|The car was finally fixed. After putting the tools back in the trunk, [Zhang Side] picked up his hat and was about to get in the car. However, as soon as he opened the door, he heard the sound of the tire leaking air again.
1:5:57|1:6:6|At the same time, the meeting has already started. He must get the tire and fix the car before the chairman finishes the meeting. Even on the bumpy sand, he doesn't slow down.
1:6:44|1:6:53|[Zhang Side] has arrived at the bridge and will be there soon. Both of his shoes have disappeared, and he has been running barefoot for most of the way.
1:7:20|1:7:24|He finally arrived at the entrance of the market. When the squad leader saw him coming, he quickly took off the tire to repair the car.
1:7:24|1:7:27|At the moment the tire was removed, he almost fell to the ground.
1:7:27|1:7:32|[Zhang Side] was so tired that he couldn't stand up straight, using the last of his strength to walk to the side of the car and lean against it to rest.
1:7:32|1:7:34|His gaze was unfocused, constantly panting heavily.
1:8:36|1:8:45|At the end of the speech, there was enthusiastic applause in the room, and [Mao Zedong]'s words deeply resonated with everyone.
1:8:45|1:8:50|After the meeting, [Mao Zedong] and a group of people walked out of the conference room.
1:8:50|1:8:52|The car has been fixed and is parked safely in front of [Mao Zedong].
1:8:57|1:9:0|[Zhang Side] awkwardly tries to hide his feet.
1:9:5|1:9:11|The Chairman sat in the car, while [Zhang Side] returned to the back footboard. The car drove away slowly, and this time there were no more accidents.
1:9:11|1:9:19|After returning to the camp, [Zhang Side] still had Liu Bingzhong on his mind, so he came to find Geng Yuqiu again. Even though they didn't settle things last time, he wanted to give it another try.
1:9:19|1:9:26|This time he did not go directly, but through the factory director. He stood in front of the honor roll waiting and watching. However, after a long time, the factory director came out alone.
1:10:2|1:10:7|Geng Yuqiu was crying bitterly on the cabinet, not knowing what to do at the moment.
1:10:24|1:10:27|[Zhang Side] lowered his head, afraid to meet Liu Bingzhong's gaze.
1:10:27|1:10:37|Liu Bingzhong fell silent for a moment, unable to speak the words that were on the tip of his tongue. He lowered his head and looked slowly outside the railing, paused, and slowly said.
1:10:37|1:10:44|[Zhang Side] stopped his movements and wanted to say something, but found himself unable to speak. Liu Bingzhong lowered his head.
1:10:44|1:10:47|[Zhang Side] lied for the first time, hesitated for a long time and couldn't say a word.
1:11:51|1:11:59|[Zhang Side] looked incredulous, with a face full of shock as he gazed at Liu Bingzhong. After the surprise, a glimmer of hope ignited within him, and he stood up and walked to his side.
1:12:22|1:12:25|Liu Bing choked with emotion, and he suddenly stood up and walked to the side.
1:12:25|1:12:28|[Zhang Side] wanted to help him, but he was pushed away by [Mao Zedong].
1:12:44|1:13:8|Seeing Liu Bingzhong full of fighting spirit again, [Zhang Side] was overjoyed and tears welled up in his eyes. He wanted to say something but instead hugged his old comrade directly, blending all his words into the embrace.
1:13:8|1:13:11|[Zhang Side] looked around, lowered his voice and comforted again.
1:13:22|1:13:39|Saying goodbye to Liu Bingzhong, [Zhang Side] rushed to see Song Guangming, and the two sat chatting at the hospital entrance.
1:13:39|1:13:43|In the hospital room, the [doctor] picked up an umbrella with a serious expression, ready to leave, when [Zhou Yuemei] hurriedly arrived.
1:13:46|1:13:51|[Zhou Yuemei] slowly walked to the bedside, tears uncontrollably streaming down her cheeks.
1:14:6|1:14:14|[Zhou Yuemei] tremblingly took Wang Changling's hand, which had been beaten to a pulp, his eyes unfocused and his face covered in bandages.
1:14:35|1:14:41|[Zhang Side] didn't know how to explain to him. At this moment, [Qiu Yuemei] opened the curtain and walked out, leaning against the door frame, tears streaming down her face.
1:14:41|1:14:45|[Zhang Side] felt something was wrong, stood up, and stared straight at him with a puzzled look.
1:14:45|1:14:48|[Qiu Yuemei] couldn't contain her sadness and ran out of the hospital room.
1:14:54|1:14:58|Tears mixed with rain flowed down together, [Qiu Yuemei] furrowed her brows, tears gushing like a spring.
1:14:58|1:15:2|[Zhang Side] slowly walked towards him, but hesitated to ask Wang Changlin how he was doing.
1:15:2|1:15:6|[Qiu Yuemei] felt his presence, slowly turned around, and [Zhang Side] asked softly.
1:16:43|1:16:46|It was already night, [Mao Zedong] arrived at the field hospital.
1:16:46|1:16:48|He hurried along, almost wanting to run through the gate.
1:16:48|1:16:52|[Doctor] The nurse was already waiting at the door, ready to report to him.
1:16:52|1:16:54|A group of people hurriedly walked towards [Wang Changling]'s ward.
1:17:6|1:17:14|Qiu Yuemei was very fortunate that [Mao Zedong] could come. His eyes were full of light, as if grasping a life-saving straw. [Mao Zedong] took off his hat and walked towards [Wang Changlin].
1:17:28|1:17:37|[Mao Zedong] looked concerned, at this moment [Wang Changling] moved his eyes slightly, slowly opened them, and everyone looked at him with joy.
1:17:37|1:17:42|[Wang Changling]'s lips moved slightly, as if he was saying something, but his body was too weak for everyone to hear clearly.
1:17:42|1:17:49|[Mao Zedong] bent down to bring his ear closer to [Zhang Side]'s mouth, but still couldn't hear clearly, so he had to ask him to repeat it.
1:19:55|1:20:1|[Wang Changling] sacrificed like this, not even finishing his last sentence.
1:20:1|1:20:3|[Mao Zedong] gently placed his hand back on the bed.
1:20:19|1:20:30|Chairman Mao Zedong stood quietly by the bed, looking at this brave soldier. He sighed heavily, walked to a place facing away from everyone to wipe away his tears. His face was full of sorrow and pain, another soldier sacrificed in the war.
1:20:34|1:20:39|Chairman Mao Zedong looked out the window at the pouring rain, his face full of certainty.
1:20:39|1:20:42|His gaze was firm, as if he had known the outcome all along.
1:20:46|1:21:3|Outside the ward, [Zhang Side] plays in the rain. Although Wang Changling sacrificed himself, his spirit lives on. This generation, including [Zhang Side], will grow up listening to his stories, continuing to build China. It is because of people like him, who are not afraid of sacrifice, that these children, including [Zhang Side], can grow up carefree.
1:21:26|1:21:34|Shortly afterwards, they arrived at their destination. At this moment, [Zhang Side] and his companions were cutting down trees in the woods. He was wearing a large vest, and his clothes were already soaked with sweat.
1:21:41|1:21:45|Everyone cut the tree trunk into evenly sized wooden sections to make probes.
1:21:45|1:21:48|[Zhang Side] shuttles back and forth, checking the situation at the cave entrance.
1:21:48|1:21:50|After finishing these tasks, he went to cook.
1:21:50|1:21:53|The next day, all the tunnels were fully excavated and they were about to start the ignition.
1:22:2|1:22:7|Above the cave, white smoke slowly rose as several openings were lit simultaneously, demonstrating a very high efficiency.
1:22:8|1:22:8|The smoke has cleared.
1:22:23|1:22:30|[Zhang Side] ran down the mountain and personally inspected every cave entrance. Xiao Bai was choked by the thick smoke and ran out to catch his breath.
1:22:46|1:22:50|A fire suddenly broke out at a cave entrance, and [Zhang Side] and everyone rushed up quickly.
1:22:50|1:22:56|Hearing the call from Dali, Zhang Side stood up leisurely, showing no intention of going to help.
1:23:2|1:23:7|After a busy day's work, [Mao Zedong] put down his shovel and straw hat, ready to take a break and have a drink of water.
1:23:7|1:23:10|But as soon as he lifted the kettle, he noticed something wrong with the nearby hole.
1:23:10|1:23:13|He quickly put down the water cup and walked forward to check.
1:23:13|1:23:16|He put his ear close to the hole and heard the sound of burning inside.
1:23:16|1:23:19|He hurriedly looked up and gazed at the top of the hole.
1:23:34|1:23:39|The flames were extinguished by several buckets of water, and the charcoal that everyone had worked hard to burn for several days was destroyed in an instant.
1:23:39|1:23:44|The soldiers sat on the ground, each one looking dejected, even [Zhang Side] appeared dispirited.
1:23:44|1:23:48|This kiln charcoal has cost him a lot of effort, and now he is more sad than anyone else.
1:23:48|1:23:51|At this moment, the sound of a harmonica drifted in, leaving everyone in a daze.
1:23:51|1:23:54|Dali stood up angrily and followed the voice to find Xiaobai.
1:23:57|1:23:59|Seeing that he did not agree, [Zhang Side] hurriedly followed.
1:23:59|1:24:5|Xiao Bai is sitting by the lake at this moment, leisurely playing the harmonica, while Da Li angrily strides over to him.
1:24:5|1:24:8|Xiao Bai stopped his movements when he saw [Zhang Side], looking at him puzzled.
1:24:33|1:24:37|[Zhang Side] and Dali locked eyes for a moment, both expressing disbelief in their gaze.
1:24:37|1:24:40|He took Xiaobai's harmonica and patiently reasoned with her.
1:24:51|1:24:57|Seeing Xiaobai being so stubborn, [Zhang Side] was so angry that he took a deep breath and threw the harmonica into the pot.
1:25:3|1:25:12|After speaking, [Zhang Side] turned and left. Dali, feeling unresolved anger, glared fiercely at Xiaobai before also turning away. Tears welled up in Xiaobai's eyes.
1:25:12|1:25:20|[Zhang Side] returned to the cave, picked up a shovel, and cut off all the branches blocking the entrance of the small white cave with force, as if wanting to vent all his anger.
1:25:20|1:25:27|Even though Xiaobai was so unreasonable, after calming down, [Zhang Side] still spoke kindly to her and personally brought the meal into the house.
1:25:29|1:25:31|Xiao Bai lay on the bed ignoring him.
1:25:34|1:25:42|Seeing Xiaobai still ignoring him, [Zhang Side] wanted to say something, but feeling guilty, he just silently placed the meal on the table and left.
1:25:42|1:25:56|After lunch, everyone cleaned up the abandoned charcoal fire together. [Zhang Side] was worried about Xiao Bai in his heart, and he was distracted while working.
1:25:56|1:25:57|[Zhang Side] couldn't help but show a blue face.
1:26:5|1:26:8|[Zhang Side] walked away dejectedly.
1:26:8|1:26:13|[Zhang Side] came to the pond where the dispute happened that day, jumped into the water to find the discarded harmonica.
1:26:13|1:26:19|He was very careful, afraid of missing any spot, diving down three or four times repeatedly, finally found the harmonica.
1:26:19|1:26:27|He finally smiled, [Zhang Side] didn't even have time to put on his clothes before hurriedly looking for Xiaobai, his body was wet, unable to distinguish whether it was water or sweat.
1:26:28|1:26:31|[Zhang Side] looked around the room and didn't see anyone.
1:26:31|1:26:35|Upon further inspection of the bed, only a straw mat and a few blankets remained, with everything else gone.
1:26:35|1:26:39|[Zhang Side] saw the situation and immediately became flustered, rushing out to search.
1:26:39|1:26:43|He climbed up a small hill and finally saw Xiaobai, who had already walked far ahead.
1:26:43|1:26:45|He hadn't even caught his breath, and he shouted anxiously:
1:27:4|1:27:9|Seeing Xiaobai walking further and further away, [Zhang Side] took a shortcut and hid directly in front of him.
1:27:28|1:27:33|Xiao Bai stopped to look at [Zhang Side], then started to walk forward again, but didn't go far before stopping in his tracks.
1:27:33|1:27:42|[Zhang Side] did not expect that Xiaobai would want to leave so much, and tried to persuade him again.
1:27:42|1:27:50|Xiao Bai turned around, and [Zhang Side] held up the harmonica in front of him. When he saw the harmonica, a hint of surprise flashed in his eyes, and his expression relaxed slightly.
1:27:59|1:28:5|[Xiao Bai] was overwhelmed with emotions. He didn't take the harmonica and walked to the side, crying loudly.
1:28:5|1:28:8|[Zhang Side] saw him like this, and his inner guilt increased a few more points.
1:28:54|1:29:0|Dozens of eyes stared straight at Xiaobai, who lowered his head guiltily. [Zhang Side] quickly stepped in to defuse the situation.
1:29:17|1:29:22|Everyone became interested and looked at [Zhang Side] with curiosity on their faces.
1:30:12|1:30:16|[Zhang Side] solemnly instructed Xiao Bai and quickly ran to investigate the situation.
1:30:16|1:30:19|Xiao Bai sat quietly at the table, tears welling up in her eyes.
1:30:19|1:30:25|He finally realized his mistake, realizing how absurd he had been before, regretting deeply.
1:30:25|1:30:32|The next morning, Zhang Side and Mao Zedong led the charcoal-burning team to gather early, enthusiastically moving the wooden barrels to prepare for resuming charcoal production.
1:30:32|1:30:38|After awakening, Xiaobai was full of energy. Seeing Xiaobai able to turn over a new leaf, [Zhang Side] was also overjoyed.
1:30:39|1:30:52|At this moment, the team is walking in the dense forest, each person carrying a large basket half a meter high on their back. The path is steep, and they proceed with caution step by step.
1:30:52|1:30:56|Xiao Bai sat on the ground, crazily pouring water into his mouth. [Zhang Side] quickly walked over to inquire.
1:30:59|1:31:4|This firm response amused [Zhang Side], who picked up Xiao Bai's luggage and prepared to continue walking forward.
1:31:4|1:31:12|Xiaobai wanted to stop him, but [Zhang Side] didn't give him a chance at all. Xiaobai looked at his back and made up his mind to become a person like him, not afraid of hardship.
1:31:12|1:31:18|He averted his gaze, shouldered the backpack, and continued on his way in peace. He didn't want to let down the help from Zhang Side.
1:31:18|1:31:25|Fortunately, Zhang Side and the main force did not fall too far behind. They soon caught up. The squad walked along the rugged mountain road from day to sunset.
1:31:25|1:31:31|After a day of running around, Zhang Side finally started to head back, the burden on his back becoming noticeably heavier.
1:31:31|1:31:34|After coming back from the mountain, everyone immediately reopened the tunnel entrance.
1:32:1|1:32:6|Xiao Bai took the initiative to dig the hole to make up for the mistake he had made earlier.
1:32:6|1:32:13|[Zhang Side] came down to inspect and took the opportunity to water the plants for him.
1:32:13|1:32:20|Xiao Bai only just came down from the ladder, but his eyes were fixed on the top.
1:32:25|1:32:29|Xiao Bai helped [Zhang Side] down the ladder, handed him the water cup, and then climbed back up to continue working.
1:32:29|1:32:41|[Zhang Side] didn't expect he could be so proactive.
1:32:41|1:32:44|After bathing by the pond, everyone gathered together to have a meal.
1:33:22|1:33:25|[Zhang Side] is lying leisurely on the bed.
1:33:25|1:33:29|The crowd was discussing something enthusiastically, while [Zhang Side] gazed at the full moon above in a trance.
1:33:51|1:34:6|At this moment, he took off his backpack, took out the shoes given to him by [Mao Zedong], and put them on vigorously.
1:34:48|1:34:53|Laughter erupted from the room from time to time, everyone was enjoying this rare leisure time.
1:34:53|1:34:56|Outside the house, a gentle breeze blows, while cicadas are chirping in the midst of the hot summer.
1:34:56|1:35:4|In the early morning, as the sky poured down heavy rain, the straw mat couldn't withstand the water's erosion, revealing holes. A few drops of rain fell on the sleeping Zhang Side's feet.
1:35:4|1:35:8|He intended to change his posture and squint for a while, but felt something was wrong in his heart, so he sat up to take a look.
1:35:8|1:35:14|He looked sleepily at the ceiling, turned his head to find that [Zhang Side] and Xiaobai's beds were empty.
1:35:14|1:35:16|He quickly woke up his comrade next to him and put on his clothes before getting out of bed.
1:35:28|1:35:39|[Zhang Side] is now running towards the big shed where charcoal is stored, holding two bundles of straw mats. The muddy ground mixed with rainwater makes his feet slip, and he throws the straw mats onto the roof of the shed.
1:35:39|1:35:43|As a result of exerting too much force, he also flung himself out and fell heavily to the ground.
1:35:43|1:35:49|He didn't care about the vine, quickly climbed up the ladder, spread the straw mat evenly to prevent the coal from getting damp from the leaking roof.
1:35:49|1:35:53|After finishing these tasks, he hurriedly ran to the entrance of Xiao Bai's cave.
1:36:44|1:36:50|[Zhang Side] heard the pleasant music, and he worked with even more vigor. At this time, they hurriedly rushed to the location.
1:36:50|1:37:7|In the pouring rain, the charcoal kiln was hidden in the curtain of rain, like a water curtain cave. Suddenly, several pieces of rubble fell vertically from the top of the mountain. Xiao Bai and [Zhang Side] were immersed in the music, and no one noticed. The torrential rain carried the mud, sand, and rocks on the charcoal kiln rushing down, like a mudslide.
1:37:7|1:37:17|Xiao Bai and [Zhang Side] are in the cave, completely unaware of the impending danger, still happily working. Only the swaying water kettle, shaken by the vibrations, foresees the arrival of this disaster.
1:37:17|1:37:26|They were climbing up the hill in Dali when suddenly there was a loud noise not far away. They hurried forward a few steps, only to see the collapse of the cave entrance of [Zhang Side] and Xiaobai.
1:37:38|1:37:46|The sweat-soaked soil and sand were washed away by the heavy rain, causing trees on the mountain to also roll down. The speed was too fast, and [Zhang Side] didn't have time to run out.
1:37:46|1:37:52|On September 5, 1994, [Zhang Side] hastily ended his life in the Shek Gorge area of An'sai, Shaanxi.
1:37:52|1:37:58|The heavy rain continued to pour down, as if a huge pearl curtain was hung between the sky and the earth, shrouding everything in mist.
1:37:59|1:38:5|The surroundings were quiet, with only the sound of rain audible. Everyone was immersed in the news of [Zhang Side]'s sacrifice and unable to extricate themselves.
1:38:5|1:38:9|Raindrops formed into lines, falling vertically along the tiles, giving a sense of loneliness.
1:38:9|1:38:14|Raindrops slanted down on the accumulated water on the ground, creating ripples.
1:38:14|1:38:17|In the room, [Mao Zedong] sat quietly on the rattan chair.
1:38:43|1:38:49|He smiles like a child.
1:38:52|1:38:53|He still seems like a child.
1:38:55|1:39:1|He is the most outstanding soldier in the security guard team.
1:39:4|1:39:6|Both parents are gone.
1:39:6|1:39:11|The Chairman was slightly stunned, tears welled up in his eyes, his face full of compassion for [Zhang Side].
1:39:40|1:39:47|Captain Gu handed the phone to the Chairman, who put down the brush fan and took the phone with a serious expression.
1:40:22|1:40:25|Captain Gu [Geng Yezhu] hesitated for a long time before agreeing.
1:40:25|1:40:36|After Captain Gu left, Chairman Mao sat motionless in front of the desk, unable to help but recall every little detail with Zhang Side. His expression became even more sorrowful and regretful, regretting why he didn't try to understand him more.
1:40:36|1:40:45|At the same time, [Zhang Side] is working in the yard, having been released from prison and starting a new life.
1:40:45|1:40:50|[Feng Yuqiu] finally reconciled with [Liu Bingzhong]. At this moment, when [Liu Bingzhong] saw him coming, he hurried out to find him.
1:40:52|1:41:7|[Geng Yuqiu] hadn't even spoken yet when tears started to fall.
1:41:7|1:41:12|Sending Guangming throws this question to [Qiu Yuemei], she looks at the innocent child in front of her, thinking of explaining.
1:41:20|1:41:29|[Qiu Yuemei] didn't want Song Guangming to taste the pain of losing loved ones again, so she decided to create a fairy tale for him. He spoke again, with a firm tone.
1:41:29|1:41:41|[Qiu Yuemei] hugged Song Guangming in her arms, and [Zhang Side]'s sacrifice reminded him of Wang Changling again. Although these words were meant to comfort Song Guangming, they were also comforting himself. They were just asleep, as their spirits will always exist in the world.
1:41:44|1:41:52|[Zhang Side] lies on the bed, with the brand new military uniform and a pair of straw shoes sent by Chairman Mao placed on it. Xiao Bai places a bouquet of flowers and a harmonica next to them.
1:41:52|1:41:57|He tried hard to suppress his crying, but his trembling body still betrayed him.
1:41:57|1:42:3|After putting down the things, he quickly walked out of the room. There were too many memories about [Zhang Side] here, and he dared not to recall them.
1:42:3|1:42:12|Erhu bought a copy of "The Constitution of the Communist Party of China" and a pen, [Shuangxi] put down the things and left in a hurry, everyone left their beloved items to [Zhang Side].
1:42:13|1:42:19|The squad leader fumbled in the pocket on his chest and slowly opened a cloth bag, inside of which was a tobacco pipe.
1:42:19|1:42:34|[Zhang Side], who was injured in the back and dared not smoke before his death, saw the squad leader placing a pipe in front of his bed with a smug smile. He almost broke down emotionally when he got up, quickly walked out the door to prevent tears from falling here. Later, everyone returned and stood in two rows saluting towards the bed.
1:42:35|1:42:37|Everyone's face is filled with sorrow.
1:42:37|1:42:41|Dali stood alone in front of the bed for a long time, unwilling to let [Zhang Side] leave.
1:42:41|1:42:46|The unexpected came so quickly that he didn't even get to see his old comrade for the last time.
1:42:46|1:42:49|After everyone had left, [Zhang Side] slowly entered from outside.
1:42:49|1:42:53|He leaned against the wall, walking slowly step by step.
1:42:53|1:42:56|He stood at the door, quietly looking at his godson's bed.
1:42:56|1:42:58|[Zhang Side] was deeply affected by the death.
1:42:58|1:43:4|Within just a few months, the old revolutionary's body went from being spirited during the Chinese New Year to now being frail and weak.
1:43:4|1:43:11|He walked slowly to the bed, his palm constantly searching on the bed, trying to find the temperature of his son, but there was nothing.
1:43:11|1:43:16|He smoothed out the sheets, his movements gentle as if he were caressing Zhang Side's head.
1:43:16|1:43:22|[Zhang Side] promised to see him in the winter before he left, but now this promise can never be fulfilled.
1:43:22|1:43:25|The old revolutionary sat on the edge of the bed, suppressing his urge to cry.
1:43:26|1:43:28|Even so, one can still hear his sorrow.
1:43:28|1:43:34|He took out two big red dates from his pocket and placed them on the bed, stacking them into a small mountain. This is the love of the old revolutionary.
1:43:34|1:43:41|[Zhang Side] loves to eat this. The old revolutionary picked up a date with a shaky hand, imitated [Zhang Side], and put the date into his mouth.
1:43:41|1:43:48|The red dates are clearly sweet, but mixed with tears, they become bitter and astringent, the old man cannot hide the pain in his heart.
1:43:48|1:44:6|Zhou Baba's face was covered with tears, the old revolutionary took off his hat, speechless with anger. The memorial service proceeded as scheduled, a small white flower pinned to everyone's chest, the pure white flowers as simple and innocent as [Zhang Side], drawing out the image of [Zhang Side] on paper, deeply kissing it, soldiers firing guns and blowing horns.
1:44:6|1:44:9|This is the highest tribute to the hero.
1:44:16|1:44:21|After the introduction of [Zhang Side]'s life story, everyone stood up and Chairman Mao began his speech.
1:44:59|1:45:1|Walking along the bustling street by the riverbank.
1:47:1|1:47:5|Our comrades are facing difficulties.
1:48:10|1:48:14|Everyone was inspired by [Mao Zedong]'s words, their expressions becoming even more determined.
1:48:14|1:48:20|After the memorial service ended, everyone also began to evacuate, and the venue returned to its original state, as if nothing had ever happened.
1:48:20|1:48:31|But Zhang Side's spirit has taken root in everyone's heart at this moment. There will be thousands of Zhang Sides to complete his unfinished mission for him. He will live forever in people's hearts.
1:48:31|1:48:41|In the hearts of the people, [Zhang Side] has always been running, always busy, running in the fields, running between mountains and rivers, and everyone knows it.
1:48:41|1:48:47|He runs for the people, works for the country, with a rifle on his back as a young man, a simple smile, and clear eyes.
1:48:47|1:48:51|This smile will be forever imprinted in everyone's heart.
