0:1:34|0:1:44|The first group of staff from the Chinese delegation flew to Indonesia to attend the Asian-African Conference on the Kashmir Princess plane of Air India at Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong.
0:1:44|0:1:48|Unexpectedly, the plane encountered an accident on its way to Indonesia.
0:1:48|0:1:55|At 16:38, the Kashmir Princess plane exploded and crashed in the airspace above the South China Sea.
0:1:56|0:2:7|When the US and Taiwan were smugly preparing to celebrate their successful assassination, [Zhou Enlai] and the Chinese delegation were in Kunming preparing to go to Yangon for the meeting, not on the plane at all.
0:2:7|0:2:16|On April 12th, the Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement regarding the plane carrying the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Conference being sabotaged by Kuomintang agents and crashing.
0:2:17|0:2:22|Zhou Enlai demands the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong to thoroughly investigate.
0:2:22|0:2:28|On the night of April 11, 1955, in Kunming, under the rainy night sky, several leaders were having a meeting.
0:2:58|0:3:1|Tomorrow they will fly back to China on a special plane of Air India.
0:3:10|0:3:14|At this moment, a man in Zhongshan suit walked in holding an umbrella.
0:3:49|0:3:59|The soldier opened the car door, and the Indonesian Prime Minister [Sukarno] quickly walked up the steps with a briefcase in hand, through the corridor, and into the conference room.
0:3:59|0:4:6|After the plane crash, many leaders adopted a wait-and-see attitude towards the Asian-African Conference. He had to report the situation to the president immediately.
0:4:6|0:4:10|Indonesian President Sukarno saw him with a serious expression and asked him.
0:4:20|0:4:24|After the plane crash, trouble and chaos ensued.
0:4:24|0:4:26|[Sukarno] took the telegram and looked at it carefully.
0:4:26|0:4:29|After a moment, he took off his glasses, stood up, and spoke to the others.
0:4:36|0:4:38|[Sukarno] listened with a worried expression and said.
0:5:15|0:5:17|His mind was filled with a thousand thoughts.
0:5:29|0:5:33|[After listening, Zhou Enlai nodded in agreement.]
0:5:33|0:5:36|[Sukarno] stood up from the sofa and walked slowly towards the balcony.
0:5:36|0:5:42|Sitting on the sofa, [Shastri Amit Joshi] behind him stared blankly at his back.
0:5:42|0:5:48|[Sukarno] stood on the balcony, gazing into the distance with his eyes, his hands behind his back, lost in thought.
0:5:49|0:5:51|[Zhou Enlai] nodded.
0:5:57|0:6:3|The plane crash deeply saddened him, and he immediately blurted out his thoughts in a state of confusion.
0:6:3|0:6:4|He said solemnly.
0:6:17|0:6:29|A young man approached him with documents in hand. Seeing Wu Nu meditating, the young man stopped in his tracks. Only when Wu Nu finished meditating and stood up did the young man walk up to him and speak.
0:6:37|0:6:45|After listening, Zhou Enlai furrowed his brows, holding the telegram in his hand, lost in thought. After a moment of contemplation, he turned to the young man and said.
0:6:47|0:6:49|The young man quickly took out pen and paper when he heard this.
0:7:49|0:7:56|Sunlight spilled onto the majestic palace, and [Nehru]'s daughter walked out of the palace holding a milk bottle.
0:9:1|0:9:11|Ambassador Zongming Yao from the Zumin Palace called. Rose has summoned the diplomats stationed in Bluetooth and the wealthy families in Southeast Asia for a secret meeting that has been going on in the sunshine for two days.
0:9:12|0:9:18|In studying countermeasures, Dulles' demand is to turn the Bandung Conference into a potential platform for communism.
0:9:18|0:9:24|Among the 29 countries participating in the Bandung Conference, only 6 have established diplomatic relations with us.
0:9:24|0:9:27|22 countries accepted aid from the United States.
0:9:32|0:9:36|Several countries have just joined the Southeast Asia Treaty and Baghdad Pact organizations.
0:10:15|0:10:17|Prime Minister Zhou Enlai suddenly burst into a smile tomorrow.
0:11:10|0:11:18|[Sastroamidjojo] walked into the Indonesian president's official residence with a briefcase, smiling, to deliver some good news to President [Sukarno].
0:11:18|0:11:20|Upon hearing the president's praise, [Zhou Enlai] finally breathed a sigh of relief.
0:11:53|0:12:3|Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia [Huang Zhen] and his wife Zhu Lin arrived in Jakarta. Amidst enthusiastic applause, a group of people pushed an elderly man towards them.
0:13:40|0:13:45|After a burst of firecrackers, the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia was officially established.
0:13:45|0:13:50|Amidst the enthusiastic applause of the overseas Chinese, the Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia, [Huang Zhen], began to deliver a speech.
0:14:10|0:14:17|The audience erupted into thunderous applause, with overseas Chinese beaming with smiles, eagerly anticipating the arrival of [Zhou Enlai].
0:14:17|0:14:21|In the quiet study, [Zhou Enlai] is sitting at the desk writing a reply to Deng Yingchao.
0:15:1|0:15:8|On April 14th, [Zhou Enlai] and his entourage arrived in Rangoon on the Indian Airlines' Sky King.
0:15:8|0:15:23|On April 15th, [Zhou Enlai] met with leaders from Yangon, Unhehlu, Nasser, Wunu, Fan Wentong, and Naim Khan to discuss the format of the upcoming Asian-African Conference.
0:15:23|0:15:31|On April 16th, the Chinese government delegation arrived in Jakarta on the "Sky King" plane. Inside the airport, soldiers were nervously preparing.
0:15:37|0:15:42|After shaking hands with Prime Minister [Shastri Amarjyoti], we escorted [Zhou Enlai] quickly towards the convoy.
0:16:7|0:16:14|A small car with a national flag inserted was driving towards the crowd, inside of which was the Indonesian Prime Minister [Sukarno].
0:16:14|0:16:21|People in the atmosphere are holding national flags with joy, eagerly awaiting the arrival of [Zhou Enlai].
0:16:22|0:16:27|Although Zhou Enlai did not stay at the presidential palace this time, President Sukarno still sent a national carriage.
0:16:36|0:16:41|Accompanied by the roar of the plane, [Zhou Enlai]'s special aircraft arrived at Jakarta's Marhalan Airport.
0:16:43|0:16:55|The plane appeared in people's sight, immediately causing cheers. Reporters rushed forward eagerly, just to capture a photo of Prime Minister [Zhou Enlai]. The plane landed smoothly, and the band immediately played symphonic music.
0:16:55|0:17:11|When Prime Minister [Zhou Enlai] appeared at the cabin door in high spirits, waving to the welcoming crowd, the airport immediately erupted in excitement. Everyone rushed forward just to catch a glimpse of this Chinese premier's charm, unable to contain their cheers of blessings.
0:17:12|0:17:22|[Zhou Enlai] stepped off the plane and warmly shook hands with the Indonesian Prime Minister [Sukarno]. People waved their national flags, expressing their inner joy.
0:17:22|0:17:26|The children warmly presented flowers to Premier [Zhou Enlai].
0:17:26|0:17:34|The two prime ministers walked in the front, with others following closely behind. Upon seeing the enthusiastic overseas Chinese, [Zhou Enlai] warmly waved to them.
0:17:34|0:17:40|Indonesian soldiers are ready, holding weapons, and standing guard on both sides with full spirits.
0:17:40|0:17:45|After the cheers of the crowd, [Huang Zhen] stood beside him and whispered to Prime Minister [Zhou Enlai].
0:17:56|0:18:0|Indonesian Prime Minister invited [Zhou Enlai] into the car, [Huang Zhen] saw this and called for his wife.
0:18:30|0:18:35|The Chinese delegation started heading towards the embassy, but the whole way was filled with fear and trepidation.
0:18:35|0:18:40|[Huang Zhen] took out a handkerchief to wipe the sweat, then turned to look at Prime Minister [Chen Yi].
0:18:40|0:18:47|[Chen Yi] took off his sunglasses and observed the surroundings outside the car vigilantly. Along the long road, the friendly crowds of Wanlong were standing on both sides.
0:18:47|0:18:53|As the Chinese delegation's convoy slowly drove through the crowd, people waved their national flags and cheered. 
0:18:54|0:18:59|But this did not relax the Chinese delegation, instead it made them even more nervous.
0:18:59|0:19:11|Julie sat in car number one, holding onto the handrail tightly, not daring to relax at all. The crowd outside was extremely enthusiastic, some holding national flags, some playing music, standing on both sides of the road, as if in a festive parade.
0:19:11|0:19:28|Sitting in the passenger seat, the young assistant loosened his collar and kept a vigilant eye on the crowd around him. At this moment, he couldn't hear the lively cheers outside at all, his only concern was the safety of Prime Minister [Zhou Enlai]. There were long banners on the street with welcoming messages written on them, and there were too many onlookers in the crowd.
0:19:28|0:19:35|Everyone was standing shoulder to shoulder, some even climbed onto trees and railings, just to catch a glimpse of [Zhou Enlai].
0:19:35|0:19:39|They waved flags, cheered enthusiastically, expressing their excited feelings.
0:19:40|0:19:54|The Indonesian people sing patriotic songs, "Hello, Hello Wanlong", expressing their joy. The Chinese people wave the Five-Star Red Flag and cheer, "Long live China and Indonesia, long live the People's Republic of China."
0:19:54|0:20:6|In front of the embassy, people had already gathered to visit Zhou Enlai.
0:20:19|0:20:24|In the end, the two of them arrived at the room of [Zhou Enlai], who smiled and said.
0:21:8|0:21:14|The Chinese delegation entered the room one after another. Zhou Enlai leaned down and whispered a few words in Huang Zhen's ear before leaving.
0:21:34|0:21:36|[Zhou Enlai] immediately spoke up as soon as he heard.
0:21:42|0:21:55|President Sukarno's ruling Indonesian National Party and other major parties mostly supported signing the treaty, with only a few opposition parties causing trouble.
0:21:58|0:22:1|Chen Yi listened and then expressed his thoughts, what did he say.
0:22:38|0:22:49|Ma Gong and his granddaughter sat in a small sedan heading towards the embassy. The granddaughter held Ma Gong's arm, her eyes fixed on the window without blinking. Ma Gong gently patted her hand when he noticed.
0:22:49|0:23:1|At night, under the pouring rain, a crowd gathers in front of the embassy to visit [Zhou Enlai]. They hold umbrellas and wear raincoats, their hair wet from the rain, but they pay no attention to it.
0:23:1|0:23:6|At this moment, a young man in a raincoat got off the car, holding a loaf of bread and walking towards the crowd.
0:23:8|0:23:11|The old man took the food and looked towards the embassy.
0:23:11|0:23:16|Not only young people, but also the elderly and children have come to the front of the embassy.
0:23:16|0:23:21|They were full of joy, not at all affected by the heavy rain.
0:23:21|0:23:24|At this moment, a car slowly drove towards the front of the embassy.
0:23:28|0:23:32|People, as if seeing hope, excitedly walked towards the car.
0:24:7|0:24:9|[Zhou Enlai] turned to Huang Zhen and said.
0:24:15|0:24:17|[Zhou Enlai] said with satisfaction.
0:24:38|0:24:46|At this moment, the rain outside has stopped, and the crowd becomes even more excited.
0:24:46|0:24:50|The crowd eagerly looked towards the door, finally welcoming Prime Minister [Zhou Enlai].
0:24:55|0:25:3|The large door slowly opened, and [Zhou Enlai], along with Chen Yi and Huang Zhen, entered the view of everyone, causing great excitement among the crowd.
0:25:3|0:25:9|They stared intently at the crowd, craning their necks to see ahead, their faces beaming with a happy smile.
0:25:9|0:25:11|Later, Huang Zhen said to everyone:
0:25:50|0:25:55|[Zhou Enlai] pondered for a moment before speaking.
0:25:55|0:25:59|Before long, the lights in the courtyard were all lit up, and everyone was excited.
0:27:17|0:27:31|In the city of Bandung, located in the Bandung Basin in western Java, Indonesia, surrounded by peaks, with beautiful scenery and lush vegetation, the climate is like spring all year round. It is known as the most beautiful city in Indonesia and is often referred to as the "Paris of Java".
0:27:31|0:27:39|On a wide grass field, [Zhou Enlai] dressed in a shirt with a bow tie, is conducting with a smile on his face, while children are singing joyful songs.
0:27:40|0:27:54|Their singing voices were loud and powerful, the beautiful girls waved flags in their hands, performing splendidly. Various musical instruments played by the children produced delightful music. They greeted the arrival of representatives from various countries with smiles and enthusiasm.
0:27:56|0:28:8|On the morning of April 18, 1955, the highly anticipated Asian-African Conference opened grandly at the Gedung Merdeka in Bandung. Soldiers also raised the flags of various countries high, signaling the official start of the conference.
0:28:8|0:28:13|10 Damansara Street is the temporary residence of the Chinese delegation in Bandung.
0:28:13|0:28:23|Outside the door, the bright red five-star flag fluttered. [Zhou Enlai] and his entourage looked at the flag, lost in thought, hoping that outside the door would be surrounded by people coming to visit Premier Zhou.
0:28:23|0:28:31|[Zhou Enlai] warmly waved and greeted them upon seeing the situation, receiving cheers and applause from the excited crowd through the door frame at that moment.
0:28:34|0:28:40|To ensure the personal safety of the delegates, most representatives from various countries are dressed in their own national costumes.
0:28:40|0:28:50|The colorful array of costumes formed a splendid scene at the venue, with crowds gathered outside watching eagerly as ambassadors from various countries warmly waved to them.
0:28:50|0:28:57|The Chinese delegation marched with firm steps in the second place, while Indonesian soldiers stood by the road with determined eyes.
0:29:3|0:29:20|At 9:00 a.m. on April 18, 1955, the opening ceremony of the Asian-African Conference officially began. The band played the national anthem of Indonesia, and leaders from various countries entered the venue one after another. There was enthusiastic applause, and journalists from various countries stood on both sides of the aisle, vying to take photos of the leaders. [Zhou Enlai] and his entourage entered the venue.
0:29:20|0:29:21|Received an enthusiastic welcome from everyone.
0:29:22|0:29:29|Ambassadors from various countries entered the venue one after another, greeting others around them in a friendly manner. The atmosphere was harmonious and pleasant.
0:29:29|0:29:45|[Zhou Enlai] encountered the former Prime Minister of Iraq, Jumaili, in the aisle. He kindly let the other party go first, but to his surprise, Jumaili looked displeased. While people around were still applauding and welcoming, Jumaili arrogantly took his seat, showing a disdainful expression, completely out of sync with the others. Premier Chen Yi sat inside with sunglasses on.
0:29:48|0:29:54|Once everything was in place, a male journalist deliberately approached [Zhou Enlai] and recorded this moment for him.
0:29:54|0:30:6|The ambassadors of various countries have entered the venue. The Indonesian Prime Minister glanced at the Indonesian President [Sukarno] beside him, who nodded. He immediately understood the meaning.
0:30:23|0:30:29|[Sukarno] stood up, walked towards the podium, and delivered a passionate and stirring speech.
0:30:58|0:31:1|This statement immediately won a round of applause from everyone.
0:31:31|0:31:38|[Sukarno]'s speech was unanimously recognized, even the people outside the venue applauded him warmly, and then he continued.
0:31:52|0:31:57|After [Sukarno]'s speech, there were both joy and worry among the audience.
0:31:57|0:32:1|He returned to his seat and warmly waved to the audience below.
0:32:1|0:32:6|At this moment, a foreign journalist noticed the issue.
0:32:6|0:32:9|A small car with a five-starred red flag drives into the courtyard.
0:32:9|0:32:14|[Huang Zhen] got out of the car and walked quickly into the house with a briefcase in his hand.
0:32:14|0:32:18|The people in the room are having a meal, [Zhu Lin] stands up to greet him.
0:32:18|0:32:22|He just waved his hand and then hurriedly came to [Zhou Enlai]'s side without stopping.
0:32:47|0:32:48|[Chen Yi] frowned.
0:32:58|0:33:0|[Zhou Enlai] nodded and said to [Huang Zhen].
0:33:3|0:33:6|He paused for a moment before expressing his thoughts.
0:33:24|0:33:30|According to the agreement reached at the preparatory meeting, the secret meeting should have started directly after the opening ceremony.
0:33:30|0:33:42|At the proposal of the Pakistani representative, after consultations among the delegations, this afternoon and tomorrow will be changed to plenary sessions, allowing each country's delegation to speak for 20 minutes. [Zhou Enlai]
0:33:42|0:33:50|India, Myanmar, China, and Indonesia have all indicated that they do not plan to speak at the plenary session.
0:33:50|0:33:54|The rest of the delegations will speak at the conference in the agreed order.
0:33:55|0:34:5|With these words, the meeting officially entered the first phase, with representatives from various countries speaking. The first was the former King of Cambodia, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, followed by the Prime Minister of Egypt, Nasser.
0:34:8|0:34:15|Following are the pillars of the Japanese Economic Planning Agency, Takagi, and the Syrian Foreign Minister, Azem.
0:34:17|0:34:30|Laos Prime Minister Kaysone, Lebanese Prime Minister Solh, and the majority of representatives all hope that the conference will contribute to promoting world peace, strengthening normal economic cooperation, and condemning colonialism and racism.
0:34:30|0:34:43|But due to instigation by the United States, former Iraqi Prime Minister Khamari sang a different tune.
0:34:43|0:34:47|Gamma Liang walked up to the platform with a proud smile on his face and his head held high.
0:34:47|0:34:50|[Zhou Enlai] looked at his back, deep in thought.
0:35:43|0:35:45|The journalist also started taking photos non-stop.
0:35:51|0:35:56|[Zhou Enlai] furrowed his brow, picked up a pen and wrote angrily on the paper, while the people below whispered and discussed among themselves.
0:35:58|0:36:1|He had the people around him pass a note to [Chen Yi].
0:36:15|0:36:22|[Sukarno] tapped the small wooden hammer, trying to maintain order in the meeting hall, but it was ineffective. [Jamalila] then started to appeal to the crowd.
0:36:33|0:36:40|In this hall, it is not difficult to hear the Voice of America.
0:36:40|0:36:47|At this moment, the journalists did not film [Jia Mali] speaking on stage, but instead turned the camera towards [Zhou Enlai] in the audience.
0:36:58|0:37:19|The delegates from various countries stood up and left the meeting room. However, [Zhou Enlai] met [Jamali] again in the aisle. He politely gestured for [Jamali] to go first, but to his surprise, she showed a fierce expression with a hostile look in her eyes.
0:37:19|0:37:25|The Chinese delegation is returning to their residence by car, while [Zhu Ling] is setting up a memorial for the 11 victims.
0:37:45|0:37:51|As soon as the words fell, the Chinese delegation arrived at the residence, and the assistant opened the car door for them.
0:38:21|0:38:31|The crowd fell silent upon hearing this, walking into the venue with heavy hearts. What they saw were eleven urns placed on the table.
0:38:31|0:38:42|Seeing this scene, everyone's footsteps came to a halt. After a moment of contemplation, they approached the table, the quiet and solemn meeting room, the poignant curtains and wreaths, all causing their expressions to become solemn.
0:38:43|0:38:49|They stood together in the middle of the venue, with [Zhou Enlai] leaning forward slightly, trying to get a clear view of their faces.
0:38:49|0:38:56|On the small urns were photos and names of each person, with some charred remains in the tray next to them. [Zhou Enlai]
0:38:56|0:38:59|After hesitating for a moment, [Zhou Enlai] walked forward and reached out to touch the urn.
0:39:0|0:39:6|[Zhou Enlai] took out a handkerchief from his pocket and carefully wiped the photo on the urn for them.
0:39:6|0:39:18|After a moment, [Zhou Enlai] tremblingly picked up the shattered debris on the tray. His brows furrowed, tears already filled his eyes, and tears streamed down his face as he continuously wiped away the tears with his hands.
0:39:18|0:39:27|Chen Yi also bent down, looking at their photos with great sorrow. He was so overwhelmed with grief that he couldn't speak for a moment. Many comrades behind him also bowed their heads in mourning.
0:39:28|0:39:37|At the meeting, tears of sorrow streamed down Chen Yi's face. With tear marks all over his face, [Zhou Enlai] slowly stood up, looking ahead with a determined gaze, and let out a deep sigh.
0:39:37|0:39:45|The atmosphere on the scene was both sad and solemn, many comrades spontaneously took out handkerchiefs and took off their glasses to wipe their tears sorrowfully.
0:39:45|0:39:51|These eleven comrades came for the meeting, but unfortunately died on the way, causing great sorrow to everyone.
0:39:51|0:39:54|The Asian-African Conference was also full of crises.
0:40:33|0:40:35|In the audience, people were discussing animatedly.
0:41:14|0:41:14|Now.
0:41:17|0:41:24|Please let Mr. Romulo, the special envoy of the President of the Philippines, speak.
0:42:6|0:42:15|Following Zhou Enlai's instructions, Pu Shouchang slowly walked towards the podium and submitted our country's speech application to the host, Shastri Amizoyo.
0:42:15|0:42:16|The moment these words were spoken, it caused a stir among the audience.
0:42:29|0:42:40|[Zhou Enlai] returned to his residence, walked into the room, stood in front of the desk lost in thought. Seeing this, everyone looked at each other in confusion, and then the man behind couldn't help but speak up.
0:42:40|0:42:45|Unexpectedly, [Zhou Enlai] still did not respond to him, and everyone looked at each other in confusion.
0:42:45|0:42:48|Zhou Enlai turned around and said.
0:42:51|0:42:55|The man nodded, sincere and strong, waved to everyone, and asked them to leave.
0:42:55|0:43:4|After everyone left, [Zhou Enlai] pulled a chair to the desk, tidied up the right side of the table, placed paper and pen, and waited for Piao Shouchang to arrive.
0:43:4|0:43:7|Downstairs, [Zhu Ling] is also busy working for the Prime Minister.
0:43:19|0:43:25|Chen Yi sat alone at the dining table, absentmindedly eating while the wind howled outside and thunderstorms raged.
0:43:25|0:43:33|[Zhou Enlai] and Park Su-chang are busy preparing for Xia Wu's speech together, the desk is covered with papers, but his pen is still writing non-stop.
0:43:55|0:43:57|They walked towards the front desk holding a telegram.
0:44:15|0:44:22|Chen Yi dropped the fan and picked up the letter.
0:44:22|0:44:29|Upon hearing this, [Chen Yi] immediately became serious, quickly turned off the radio, walked to the desk, put on his glasses, and carefully began to read.
0:45:5|0:45:13|Chen Yi finished reading, his face changed drastically. He took off his glasses, gave the two a meaningful look, sat down slowly, and slammed the letter hard on the table.
0:45:38|0:45:43|Upon receiving Chen Yi's orders, members of the security team led by [Zhou Enlai] immediately began preparations.
0:45:43|0:45:49|He tucked a pistol into his pocket, and after a brief adjustment, there was no sign of any flaw.
0:45:49|0:45:59|He stood up and walked to the mirror, looking at his reflection and going through a practice routine, aiming the gun, moving smoothly and swiftly, all to ensure the personal safety of [Zhou Enlai].
0:45:59|0:46:4|Outside the meeting venue in the afternoon, a crowd of people gathered, and a small sedan with the five-star red flag drove towards the entrance of the venue.
0:46:5|0:46:6|[Zhou Enlai] slowly enters the meeting room.
0:47:7|0:47:21|Now please let Prince Naradhip Prapanpong of Thailand make a speech at the conference.
0:47:30|0:47:38|In the neighboring Yunnan Province of China, which is encouraging the Dai people to implement autonomy, [Zhou Enlai] began writing with a pen.
0:48:21|0:48:26|The speech by the Thai representative Prince Wanaradit has caused dissatisfaction among many delegates.
0:48:26|0:48:33|In front of the Chinese delegation, he made such a statement, causing the atmosphere of the meeting to become tense. The sincerity was overwhelming, while [Zhou Enlai] remained smiling.
0:48:33|0:48:34|As soon as these words were spoken, all eyes in the room turned to [Zhou Enlai].
0:48:46|0:48:49|The reporters who were originally outside the hall immediately rushed into the hall.
0:48:49|0:48:55|They also wanted to get the news as soon as possible, and the hall was quiet with all the lights on.
0:48:55|0:48:59|Under the gaze of the audience, [Zhou Enlai] stood up and walked towards the podium.
0:48:59|0:49:10|[Zhou Enlai] walked with a firm step, holding the speech manuscript in his hand. He passed rows of seats and ascended the podium in the middle of the stage. Representatives from various countries in the audience all put on their translators, eagerly anticipating [Zhou Enlai]'s speech.
0:49:10|0:49:18|[Zhou Enlai] stood on the stage, looked around the venue with a sharp gaze, and then began his brilliant speech.
0:49:32|0:49:41|[Zhou Enlai] spoke unexpectedly in his first sentence, firmly stating his position. The Thai Foreign Minister looked serious, and the audience listened attentively. After the US representative finished listening, a look of helplessness appeared on his face.
0:50:10|0:50:12|His speech was also being broadcast.
0:50:19|0:50:21|The audience outside the venue was also listening attentively.
0:50:34|0:50:36|He presented the facts directly.
0:50:36|0:50:39|But the Chinese delegation did not do so.
0:50:39|0:50:42|His speeches were tolerant and thought-provoking.
0:50:48|0:50:50|Burmese Prime Minister Wu Nu refused to listen attentively.
0:50:57|0:51:4|Among us, there was a moment of silence as everyone waited for [Zhou Enlai] to speak.
0:51:51|0:51:54|China has no intention of overthrowing neighboring governments.
0:52:18|0:52:25|With these words, the audience erupted into thunderous applause, their faces showing expressions of satisfaction, applauding in approval one after another.
0:52:25|0:52:31|However, [Zhou Enlai] looked proud, while Jamali appeared worried, and several American representatives showed displeasure on their faces.
0:52:58|0:53:1|The American representative listened with a wry smile.
0:53:19|0:53:21|Chen Yi frowned with deep concern.
0:53:35|0:53:51|[Zhou Enlai]'s speech was very well received. Burmese Prime Minister U Nu did not glance at Indian Prime Minister [Nehru], but after exchanging a glance with each other, they nodded in agreement. Seeing this, the few representatives who had previously sung a different tune could only reluctantly applaud.
0:53:51|0:53:58|The scene was buzzing with excitement, unable to calm down. [Zhou Enlai] hesitated to speak, so he could only join in the applause and wait for the right moment.
0:54:0|0:54:2|He passionately called on everyone.
0:55:8|0:55:16|[Zhou Enlai] smiled and shook hands with Ying Ge, surrounded by representatives from various countries, warmly greeting each of them.
0:55:16|0:55:20|They were all smiles, with admiration for [Zhou Enlai] in their eyes.
0:55:20|0:55:28|[Zhou Enlai] returned to his seat, the crowd around him still not dispersing. He exchanged a few words with Chen Yi and the people around him, who nodded in agreement.
0:55:29|0:55:33|As soon as he sat down, people around [Zhou Enlai] started handing him notebooks to ask for his autograph.
0:55:33|0:55:36|He gently took the notebook and signed it carefully.
0:55:36|0:55:46|In the evening, [Zhou Enlai] and the Chinese delegation attended a reception hosted by Indonesian President [Sukarno].
0:55:46|0:55:50|On the grass, a spectacular performance is taking place as the two slowly walk towards the center.
0:56:8|0:56:16|The waiter brought them wine, they raised their glasses, and [Sukarno] continued to speak to [Zhou Enlai].
0:57:1|0:57:4|[Sukarno] is introducing the little girl in a skirt.
0:57:6|0:57:9|Meijia looked at Zhou Enlai curiously.
0:57:9|0:57:11|Meijia quickly ran towards [Sukarno].
0:57:21|0:57:25|[Zhou Enlai] gently continued to ask him, right?
0:57:25|0:57:30|He looked surprised, while everyone burst into laughter.
0:57:58|0:58:1|Prime Minister [Sukarno] is talking to Chen Yi in the movie.
0:58:1|0:58:1|Chen Yi said calmly.
0:58:26|0:58:39|[Zhou Enlai] coincidentally met [Nehru] at the banquet.
0:58:39|0:58:41|[Nehru] said to [Zhou Enlai].
0:59:0|0:59:2|Yes, reported the Reuters journalist.
0:59:18|0:59:22|As soon as the words fell, a group of people on the stage attracted their attention with their Angolong.
0:59:22|0:59:25|The leading conductor greeted everyone with great respect, saying.
0:59:44|0:59:48|At the invitation of the girls, representatives from various countries walked onto the stage holding musical instruments one by one.
0:59:48|0:59:50|The conductor spoke to them.
0:59:56|1:0:6|Several delegates held Anglong gently shaking to make a sound, under the conductor's guidance, they performed a simple performance in turn, and then officially entered the performance stage.
1:0:6|1:0:8|The conductor gestures to the musicians to start playing according to the notes.
1:0:20|1:0:28|The atmosphere on the scene was joyful, with the representatives all having a great time. The conductor quickly stepped in to stop them.
1:0:31|1:0:35|After the previous rehearsal, this performance is clearly more successful.
1:0:35|1:0:43|They swayed the angklung in their hands according to the conductor's gestures, and the enchanting music lingered throughout the entire venue.
1:0:43|1:0:49|The audience below clapped enthusiastically, keeping the beat with their hands, and started singing along with the music of Angkor Wat.
1:0:49|1:0:56|They were all infected by this harmonious and friendly atmosphere, standing up one after another and walking towards the stage to sing together.
1:0:57|1:1:10|[Zhou Enlai] and Mrs. Indira Gandhi, the daughter of the Indian Prime Minister, sat together clapping and singing happily. Even the black representative joined in the singing with everyone, clapping and walking towards the stage.
1:1:10|1:1:18|This song also perfectly demonstrates the Indonesian people's welcome to representatives from various countries. The music on stage becomes more and more intense, and the atmosphere at the scene reaches its climax.
1:1:19|1:1:24|This banquet not only helped the representatives establish friendly relationships, but also brought them closer to each other.
1:1:24|1:1:36|The banquet came to an end amidst the laughter and chatter of everyone. The representatives of various countries sang together in unison in front of the stage, their faces filled with happy smiles, and their bodies swaying to the rhythm of the music.
1:1:37|1:1:45|The next day, the sun shone on Wanlong, where the scenery was beautiful and the climate pleasant, with many modern buildings that were truly stunning.
1:1:45|1:1:50|However, in such a beautiful city, the delegation represented by [Zhou Enlai] was extremely busy.
1:1:50|1:2:2|On that day, [Zhou Enlai] successively met with the head of the Cambodian delegation, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the Prime Minister of Burma, U Nu, and the representatives of Indonesia, including President [Sukarno], and had a very pleasant and harmonious conversation with them.
1:2:3|1:2:8|Watching their departing figures, [Zhou Enlai] bid farewell to the delegation with a smile on his face.
1:2:8|1:2:14|In the evening, [Zhou Enlai] continued his work.
1:2:14|1:2:21|[Zhou Enlai] interrupted him.
1:2:21|1:2:31|From eight o'clock today, a secret meeting will be held all day, divided into a Political Committee, composed of the heads of delegations from various countries. [Zhou Enlai]
1:2:31|1:2:34|At one o'clock in the afternoon, [Zhou Enlai] was already dozing off while standing.
1:3:4|1:3:6|[Zhou Enlai] suddenly woke up and gave instructions to his assistant.
1:3:10|1:3:15|As soon as the words fell, [Zhou Enlai] let out a big yawn, it was almost five o'clock.
1:3:33|1:3:37|Zhou Enlai stood up and said with concern.
1:3:37|1:3:46|[Zhou Enlai] nodded, walked to the desk, raised his hand to turn off the desk lamp, and said to the people outside the door.
1:3:51|1:4:2|[Zhou Enlai] lifted the covers and sat on the bed, wanting to sleep. Just as he lay down, he hesitated, lifted his foot to get on the bed, but hesitated upon seeing the clean and tidy sheets. He put his foot down and reached out to lift the bedding at the foot of the bed.
1:4:45|1:4:54|During the press conference, Prime Minister Kotelawala of Ceylon took out his documents to show everyone, but the journalists below were whispering to each other.
1:4:54|1:4:59|After a period of discussion, a female journalist raised her hand to ask him a question.
1:5:14|1:5:16|[Zhou Enlai] enters the hall.
1:5:54|1:5:58|There are two aspects of mental incompetence here.
1:6:5|1:6:10|The United States deployed troops in Taiwan, causing tension in the region.
1:6:10|1:6:13|The current situation has become an international issue.
1:7:19|1:7:25|At the Cairo Conference, Mr. Du issued a rule to the American delegation that no one was allowed to shake hands with the Chinese.
1:8:20|1:8:35|The American ambassador to Indonesia marked 4A on the telegram, saying solemnly.
1:8:35|1:8:46|These 69 words may seem broad, but they are actually very logically structured, and they also contain a bold and proactive initiative.
1:8:47|1:8:52|This can be said to be a rescue chapter of Zhou Enlai at the so-called Asian-African Conference.
1:8:54|1:8:56|These are three carefully considered sentences.
1:8:56|1:9:2|He just needed to seize an opportunity and play his cards right.
1:9:2|1:9:13|It was Zhou Enlai who sent such a thought-provoking brief signal in Bandung, leading to the first Sino-US ambassadorial-level talks held in Geneva on August 1, 1955.
1:9:14|1:9:19|The prolonged ambassadorial-level talks served as a direct channel of communication between the two countries. [Zhou Enlai]
1:9:19|1:9:24|In the history of the development of Sino-US relations, a significant chapter was opened by [Zhou Enlai].
1:9:24|1:9:27|In the kitchen, the chef is carefully carving a radish.
1:9:43|1:9:53|[Zhou Enlai] called Zhu Lin over after watching for a moment.
1:10:13|1:10:20|[Zhou Enlai] walked towards the door while buttoning up his shirt, suddenly he noticed the fan in the living room was on, so he quickly walked over to turn it off.
1:10:29|1:10:36|In the courtyard, under the protection of soldiers, [Sukarno] arrived at the gate in a small sedan, where Chen Yi was already waiting.
1:10:36|1:10:41|[Sukarno] and [Che Guevara] slowly got out of the car under the protection of the guards.
1:10:41|1:10:46|[Zhou Enlai] and Chen Yi quickly walked up to greet him warmly with a handshake.
1:10:46|1:10:50|Both sides met very harmoniously and they walked into the room together.
1:10:51|1:10:57|Upon entering, [Sukarno] was immediately drawn to the turned-off fan, smiling as she looked at [Zhou Enlai] beside her.
1:10:57|1:11:3|The two shared a knowing smile, and [Zhou Enlai] didn't say much, instead inviting her to continue walking forward.
1:11:3|1:11:6|On April 22, 1955, a sunny and beautiful day.
1:11:10|1:11:14|The Chinese delegation and the Indonesian side signed the "Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence Agreement".
1:11:14|1:11:19|[Zhou Enlai] shook hands with the other party in a friendly manner, exchanged agreements, and the atmosphere on the scene was peaceful.
1:11:19|1:11:23|Indonesia was also the first country to sign an agreement with China.
1:11:23|1:11:27|In the afternoon, [Zhou Enlai] attended the overseas Chinese gathering held at Zhaoqing Hall.
1:11:27|1:11:32|The overseas Chinese were very excited to see [Zhou Enlai], and the applause was continuous.
1:12:57|1:13:0|[Zhou Enlai] pondered for a moment before speaking to everyone.
1:13:13|1:13:18|[Zhou Enlai]'s response was unanimously approved, and everyone was very satisfied.
1:13:18|1:13:21|The secret meeting the next day was held as scheduled at the Red and White Flag Building.
1:13:21|1:13:27|Representatives from various countries arrived at the building in a special car, walking through the long corridor one by one towards the meeting room.
1:13:27|1:13:30|Surrounded by journalists from various countries taking photos and reporting.
1:13:30|1:13:33|The host warmly greeted everyone and gestured for them to take a seat.
1:13:39|1:13:41|Nehru's daughter and the Chinese representative are waiting.
1:14:8|1:14:9|Tulsi raises a question on behalf of [Zhou Enlai].
1:15:33|1:15:36|The Pakistani representative stood up in anger.
1:16:1|1:16:4|Jamali arrogantly spoke, making [Nehru] furious.
1:16:4|1:16:11|He threw down the translation headphones, picked up his cane, and left the venue without looking back. [Zhou Enlai]
1:16:11|1:16:13|The crowd immediately started discussing animatedly.
1:16:13|1:16:18|[Zhou Enlai] saw the situation and raised his hand to signal to [Che Guevara] to speak.
1:16:27|1:16:41|[Nehru] walked ahead by himself, completely oblivious to his daughter calling out to him from behind. She caught up to him and the reporters on the side chuckled at the scene.
1:17:10|1:17:15|At this moment, [Nehru] returned to the venue and, ignoring the gazes of the crowd, sat back in his seat.
1:18:5|1:18:9|The crowd nodded in agreement, and [Zhou Enlai] continued,
1:18:25|1:18:30|The assistant began distributing the agenda, to the displeasure of Jia Mali, [Zhou Enlai] continued speaking.
1:18:56|1:19:2|After [Zhou Enlai] finished speaking, representatives from various countries began to read the proposal carefully, and the venue fell silent.
1:19:2|1:19:10|A guard at the door couldn't resist trying to eavesdrop at the corner, but was stopped by another soldier. Soon, a round of applause was heard, leaving the reporters outside looking puzzled.
1:19:13|1:19:31|Night falls, stars twinkle, [Zhou Enlai] invites leaders from various countries to a dinner party. The courtyard is bustling with many people. A car with national flags drives into the courtyard, and the Prime Minister of Pakistan gets out of the car and warmly shakes hands with [Zhou Enlai].
1:19:45|1:19:51|Following that, the Thai Foreign Minister Prince Wanaradit arrived, and [Zhou Enlai] stepped forward to shake hands with him.
1:19:58|1:20:2|Philippine President's special envoy Romulo gets out of the car.
1:20:6|1:20:7|[Zhou Enlai] smiled happily.
1:20:7|1:20:17|[Zhou Enlai] led the delegates from various countries into the hall. A female attendant brought in three chairs and placed them in the middle. A photographer set up a camera in front, ready to take photos for everyone.
1:20:17|1:20:23|[Zhou Enlai] looked at Indira Gandhi, daughter of Nehru, who was standing beside him.
1:20:23|1:20:25|Points to the chair in front.
1:20:25|1:20:33|Indira is flattered.
1:20:33|1:20:35|[Zhou Enlai] walked towards Zhu Lin and said to her.
1:20:40|1:20:48|[Zhou Enlai] nodded in agreement, and Zhu Ling suddenly understood that Nehru was supposed to stand in the middle with [Zhou Enlai], but he shook his head and stood behind instead.
1:20:50|1:20:56|The photographer held a flash, found the right moment, pressed the shutter, and captured one precious group photo after another.
1:20:56|1:21:0|Later, everyone entered the banquet hall together, moving on to the dining segment.
1:21:0|1:21:3|At this moment, the sky bloomed with dazzling fireworks.
1:21:3|1:21:13|In the banquet hall, [Zhou Enlai] stood up, raised his glass, and addressed the representatives of various countries present.
1:21:51|1:21:58|The delegates from various countries raised their glasses and took a sip. [Zhou Enlai] walked to the center and gestured for everyone to sit down, then the discussion continued.
1:22:11|1:22:13|The crowd looked puzzled, and the assistant explained.
1:22:44|1:23:0|At 9:30 p.m. on April 24, 1955, the Asian-African Conference successfully concluded. The Bandung Conference provided New China with the opportunity to freely engage with other countries, which was of great significance in opening up China's diplomatic situation and enhancing China's international prestige.
1:23:1|1:23:7|During the seven-day conference, in addition to attending meetings of all sizes, [Zhou Enlai] extensively socialized with leaders from various Asian and African countries.
1:23:7|1:23:23|According to the recollection of Cheng Yungong, the chief guard who followed Zhou Enlai back then, Zhou Enlai continuously attended a series of luncheons, dinners, and diplomatic talks, sleeping only 13 hours in total over seven days. In the end, he successfully established diplomatic relations and achieved friendly cooperation with many countries.
1:23:23|1:23:37|During the Asian-African Conference, although different voices could be heard, everyone was able to understand each other, cooperate actively, and finally achieve complete consensus.
1:23:37|1:23:48|The twenty-nine principles jointly formulated by the twenty-nine participating countries for peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation between nations were included in the joint communique of the conference.
1:23:48|1:23:56|Including all the contents of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by countries such as China and India.
1:23:56|1:24:6|Nearly half a century has passed, and there have been significant changes in the global landscape and the relationships between various countries and China. [Zhou Enlai]
1:24:6|1:24:11|China has established diplomatic relations with 165 countries.
1:24:11|1:24:21|China has adhered to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and an independent foreign policy, making remarkable contributions to world peace.
1:24:22|1:24:34|The scene shows the scenery of the Temple of Heaven in Beijing, with the glazed tiles on the roofs shining brightly in the sunlight, giving off a dignified and peaceful atmosphere.
1:25:22|1:25:35|This song lyrics are from a song in Xi'an.
