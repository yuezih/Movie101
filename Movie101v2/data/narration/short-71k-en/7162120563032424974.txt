0:0:59|0:1:10|At this moment, two people suddenly appeared, carrying the improved sabers of General Qi, wanting to compete with the four major sects in order to establish a reputation for the saber technique created by General Qi and continue its legacy to future generations.
0:1:10|0:1:17|However, the four major sects accused them of being Japanese pirates based on their weapon resembling a wodao, and launched a pursuit against them.
0:1:17|0:1:25|The film opens with the distant spring scenery of Shuangye City, where the lotus leaves in the pond are withered and scattered in the drizzling rain.
0:1:25|0:1:31|Outside the city, a young man with a long stick made swift and decisive moves, quickly taking down the incoming enemies.
0:1:31|0:1:35|The enemy was sprawled out and paralyzed on the damp and cold desolate land.
0:1:35|0:1:41|Qiu Dongyue's companion, seeing the crisis resolved, calmly got up from the pile of firewood and left the scene with him.
0:1:41|0:1:56|Several sharp eagle cries pierced the sky. A bearded old man, carrying two guns on his back, stood beside a thatched cottage in the wilderness. He couldn't help but sigh towards the sky. This man is the top master of Shuangye City, [Qiu Dongyue].
0:1:56|0:2:2|His contemplation was interrupted by a ladle of water handed to him, delivered by the hunter's daughter, [Liang Henlu].
0:2:2|0:2:10|The gentle breeze tousled the embroidered hair beside his feet, scattering it haphazardly across his face. After a brief exchange of glances with [Qiu Dongyue], he calmly walked into the house.
0:2:15|0:2:19|Madam Qiu glanced ahead after hearing, and replied leisurely.
0:2:21|0:2:30|The hunter remained silent. [Qiu Dongyue] lowered her head and drank up the water in the dipper, then shouldered her bag and guns before continuing on into the deep mountains.
0:2:30|0:2:38|In the quiet mountain path, where everything was silent, the eagle in the sky occasionally screeched. [Qiu Dongyue] did not look back, walking alone towards the deep mountains.
0:2:38|0:2:46|At this moment, within the peaceful Shuangye City, in the Wuyixiang where the four major sects reside, an old man is sweeping the fallen leaves on the ground.
0:2:46|0:2:55|Suddenly, two young men walked up to [Qiu Dongyue], then several servants with knives emerged from the door. [Qiu Dongyue] dropped the broom in her hand and ran away from the scene.
0:2:55|0:3:1|At the same moment, two young men drew their long swords and quickly dispatched the first group of servants at the gate with every two strikes.
0:3:2|0:3:8|The two of them wore silk scarves on their heads, pressing down very low. Before the servants could even see their faces clearly, they fell to the ground and couldn't get up.
0:3:8|0:3:17|One of them is [Liang Henlu], the former personal bodyguard of General Qiujun, a seventh-level light general, while the other is the left adjutant of the Seven Armies.
0:3:17|0:3:20|After passing through the first gate with ease, Qiu Dongyue and Liang Henlu continued to walk deeper into the alley.
0:3:22|0:3:33|The long sword and the long spear intertwined, in the fight, Qiu Dongyue's right shoulder was accidentally hit by Liang Henlu, blood kept flowing out. Yang Henglu found it difficult to fight back, Qiu Dongyue leaned against the wall, unable to wield the sword.
0:3:39|0:3:45|Upon hearing the slogan shouted by the left side, [Liang Henlu] brandished his long knife and continued to stride forward.
0:3:45|0:3:48|He advances steadily, neither arrogant nor impatient, neither fast nor slow.
0:3:48|0:3:55|Before the third doorway, two armed servants were already in position, neatly tucking the trailing robes into their belts.
0:3:56|0:4:13|With his right hand holding a long-handled broadsword, [Liang Henlu] stood still waiting for [Qiu Dongyue] to approach. [Liang Henlu] then switched the knife from his right hand to his left hand, and as the two servants saw this, they momentarily let down their guard. When [Liang Henlu] walked up to the two of them, after a moment of silence, he suddenly drew his sword.
0:4:15|0:4:34|Two servants quickly blocked the long knife of [Liang Henlu], but in the next second, [Liang Henlu] kicked one man's ankle, swiftly circled behind him, knocked him out, leaving only one servant facing off against [Liang Henlu]. However, the two of them were evenly matched in weapon skills, neither able to get close. After several attempts, the servant finally put away his long knife.
0:4:34|0:4:43|Silently lowering her head, [Madam Qiu] gestured for [Liang Henlu] to continue moving forward to face the challenge. In this way, [Liang Henlu] successfully passed through the first three doors. However, in front of the fourth door, there was no one to be seen.
0:4:44|0:4:56|[Liang Henlu] stepped slowly to the door, turned around to face inside, but who could have expected that, in this moment, the person inside the door unexpectedly didn't follow the usual tactics and shot out a cold arrow.
0:4:56|0:5:13|[Liang Henlu] immediately dodged to the side, his body's center of gravity shifting in an instant, preventing him from falling to the ground. The long sword pierced through his hat, and he saw dozens of people inside the door pulling bows and arrows. Without hesitation, [Liang Henlu] got up and ran back, as the leading mistress and a dozen archers walked out of the gate.
0:5:14|0:5:34|Pressing [Liang Henlu] step by step, he was constantly on guard against the archers in front of him, trying to take away the heavily injured Zuo Pian Shi who had fallen to the ground. However, the archers were numerous and eager to surround him as soon as [Liang Henlu] made a move. Helpless, [Liang Henlu] could only retreat once again, towards the second gate.
0:5:34|0:5:40|Returning to the beginning of the alley, he pointed the long knife at the archer, bent his legs, half-squatting in a horse stance, with a determined gaze.
0:6:15|0:6:20|[Liang Henlu] heard these words, tidied up, and put down the long knife in his hand.
0:6:20|0:6:27|As the tip of the long knife touched the ground, [Liang Henlu] quickly picked up the wooden scabbard on the ground and swiftly escaped without a trace.
0:6:27|0:6:33|The leaders of the other three major sects walked over.
0:6:38|0:7:0|Another sect leader held a long sword with the left inscription, while handing it to [Madam Qiu]. [Madam Qiu] grasped the handle of the sword, took two steps forward, and carefully examined the blade on her arm. She then tapped her arm a few times with the sword, producing a deep and heavy sound.
0:7:0|0:7:5|On the left, Qiu Dongyue was guarded by two servants, who quietly averted their gaze upon witnessing the scene.
0:7:9|0:7:13|As night fell, several officials carried dim lanterns as they patrolled the streets.
0:7:13|0:7:18|On the Qinhuai River, there is always a double-decker colorful boat floating, with lights shining inside.
0:7:18|0:7:29|A beautiful and charming dancer, with thick long hair, dressed in exotic Bohemian-style clothing, her face beaming with a smile as she energetically sways her waist.
0:7:29|0:7:36|Accompanied by drumming with one hand, the movements are delicate and soft, the dance is graceful and light, expressing different postures with the changes of the classical style.
0:8:28|0:8:33|The bohemian exotic woman [Sailan] had to beat the drum again and sway her waist.
0:8:42|0:8:55|The three sisters left the colorful boat laughing, with [Madam Qiu] reluctantly continuing to dance with a frown. The contrast between her graceful dance moves and the melancholy expression on her face was striking. As she became more and more upset, she ended up throwing the hand drum directly to the ground.
0:9:20|0:9:29|When you speak of common sense, [Liang Henlu] shows a fierce look that sends shivers down one's spine.
0:9:29|0:9:33|[Sailan] and [Liang Henlu] froze in place as their eyes met.
0:9:33|0:9:41|After a moment, she took a sharp breath, dared not say another word, slowly retreated to her original position, and twisted her waist once again.
0:9:42|0:9:45|In Wuyixiang, the crowded street was filled with many people.
0:9:45|0:9:52|Madam Qiu sat on a high chair, with a melancholy and confused expression, eyes downcast, watching a group of mediocre people compete in martial arts.
0:9:52|0:9:56|Beside him, the guard Gan Gang stood, holding a long battle-axe to protect the battle.
0:9:56|0:10:4|The sound of two warriors' weapons clashing constantly, as well as the shouts when punches and kicks are thrown, filled the once quiet alleyway.
0:10:4|0:10:8|Three women from different ethnic groups mingled among the common people, watching the martial arts competition with great interest.
0:10:8|0:10:11|The two warriors cautiously probe each other, edging closer towards one another.
0:10:38|0:10:54|Upon hearing a group of women's words, [Madam Qiu] couldn't help but retort a few words back, and a smile that couldn't be contained immediately appeared on her face.
0:10:54|0:11:1|The leaders of the three major sects are present at the martial arts competition, while Madam Qiu is in the prison cell, holding a left-handed sword and examining it carefully.
0:11:1|0:11:7|The beastly Qiu Dongyue couldn't help but grunt as she squatted for a long time, causing her legs to tremble uncontrollably.
0:11:14|0:11:19|Jie Lao's face was full of mockery as he watched Qiu Dongyue being tortured and howling in agony when he was pinned to the left.
0:11:29|0:11:33|Left Pian could not bear it and eventually fainted.
0:11:33|0:11:38|Qie Lao kicked the scabbard of the long knife away when he saw it, and swung the knife to the left.
0:11:38|0:11:46|Upon hearing a noise, Qiu Dongyue, who had fainted, instantly woke up and saw a knife firmly stuck in the beam above his head.
0:11:46|0:11:47|Qiu Dongyue continued speaking.
0:13:0|0:13:7|Madam Qiu got up and walked into the left wing after hearing this, with the servants quickly carrying a chair and following closely behind her.
0:13:7|0:13:14|When Madam Qiu stood still to the left of Liang Henlu, he placed a chair behind her and she sat down gracefully.
0:13:14|0:13:17|After sitting down, he pondered for a moment and then spoke.
0:14:27|0:14:31|Mr. Xie stood up from his seat without even glancing at the off-track meal.
0:14:31|0:14:38|After taking two steps, [Qiu Dongyue] casually threw the scabbard in his hand on the ground.
0:14:47|0:15:1|Upon hearing this, Qiu Dongyue turned to look to the left. After speaking, Qiu Dongyue left the prison cell.
0:15:6|0:15:12|He then walked out of the gate and arrived at the entrance, inadvertently looking inside where the warriors' martial arts competition was still ongoing.
0:15:12|0:15:18|He was just watching calmly on the side, but a move by the warrior caused a sudden change in his expression.
0:15:18|0:15:24|Fortunately, Mr. Lu was quick and saved his beloved disciple in time from the hands of another warrior.
0:15:24|0:15:26|At the same time, there was a commotion behind the crowd.
0:15:31|0:15:37|Mr. Lu saw several soldiers approaching, and with a command, he ordered the warriors in the martial arts competition to stop fighting.
0:15:45|0:15:50|Old Jie grabbed Liu Kai's arm and turned to say two sentences to him.
0:15:50|0:15:52|[Liu Kai] turned around again, his anger subsided by half.
0:15:56|0:16:0|Madam Qiu, Wang Lao, and Lu Lang stepped forward to pat Liu Kai's armor.
0:16:51|0:16:55|[Liu Kai] turned around to leave, but saw the person sitting high above.
0:17:3|0:17:10|Liu Kai's loud greetings made Qiu Dongyue feel content, with a smile on her face as she comfortably leaned back in her chair.
0:17:10|0:17:16|Three sisters of the family admire [Liang Henlu]'s heroic bearing, their faces full of admiration, their eyes always following [Liang Henlu].
0:17:16|0:17:26|After Liang Henlu walked away, Madam Qiu turned sideways and glanced at Madam Qiu sitting on the high seat, feeling the sharpness in her gaze. Madam Qiu, undaunted, stared back at her with wide eyes.
0:17:44|0:17:48|After Madam Qiu finished speaking, she turned and walked to the chair in front of the door.
0:17:48|0:17:51|Cai Lao, Wang Lao, and Lu Lao followed closely and took their seats one after another.
0:18:19|0:18:25|Upon hearing Elder Qie's insistence, the leaders of the three major sects had no choice but to comply with his wishes.
0:18:25|0:18:29|At this moment, the exotic woman [Saran] on the boat continued to dance incessantly.
0:18:41|0:18:56|Lying on the bed, [Liang Henlu] reached out with one hand and the long knife quickly flashed, leaving only half of the ring on the side of [Sailan]'s hand bone. She looked angrily at her hand bone.
0:18:56|0:19:2|After speaking, [Sailan] couldn't hold back anymore. She covered her face with her hands and cried in grievance, while [Liang Henlu] stood up and looked at her.
0:19:5|0:19:16|[Sailan] reluctantly complied with [Liang Henlu]'s instructions and sat down next to him, despite being full of grievances.
0:19:42|0:19:47|[Sailan] placed her hands on [Liang Henlu]'s shoulders.
0:19:47|0:19:53|Liang Henlu embraced Qiu Dongyue tightly, and Qiu Dongyue also gently held his neck with both hands, responding to his embrace.
0:19:53|0:19:58|Liang Henlu, who is calm, notices the movement outside the bed at this moment.
0:19:58|0:19:59|[Sailan] was very puzzled when she heard this.
0:20:7|0:20:11|Liang Henlu handed the wine jug to him, making Madam Qiu angry, wanting to slap him.
0:20:13|0:20:17|But still fearing his gaze, she took the wine jug and walked out of the bed.
0:20:17|0:20:22|Before [Madam Qiu] lifted the curtain in [Sailan], Liang Henlu quickly tidied up the knife and flipped over to hide under the bed.
0:20:22|0:20:28|Sailan, who opened the curtain, was shocked by the scene in front of her. The shore in front of the boat was filled with people from the four major sects.
0:20:28|0:20:34|[Sailan] looked closely and saw some servants with torches inserted in the wooden stakes on the shore, holding long-handled axes at the lever.
0:20:34|0:20:39|Beside her sat [Madam Qiu] in a high position, while the three sisters sat on the stone steps by the shore.
0:20:48|0:20:52|Before [Sailan] could react, he was already dragged into the ship by Liang Henlu.
0:20:52|0:20:57|Sailan intended to pretend to faint on the ground, but was seen through by [Liang Henlu] at a glance.
0:20:59|0:21:3|Sailan had no choice but to open her eyes and look at [Liang Henlu].
0:21:8|0:21:12|Sailan lay on the ground, silently looking at the man in front of her. 
0:21:12|0:21:15|[Liang Henlu] nodded at him, and Sairan smiled happily.
0:21:15|0:21:22|With the consent of Sairan, [Liang Henlu] drew the long knife from its sheath, placed the sheath on the ground, and used it as a long stick.
0:21:22|0:21:28|Then she approached Sairan, placed the long stick on his knee, and placed one of his hands on the stick.
0:21:28|0:21:33|Sailan saw it and put the other hand up, gripping the stick tightly.
0:21:33|0:21:36|[Liang Henlu] held the stick firmly, with a cold and stern look in his eyes.
0:21:37|0:21:45|Extend the stick outside the door, close your eyes, and wait for the enemy's weapon to strike.
0:21:45|0:21:48|As soon as the stick hits,
0:21:52|0:21:58|Sailan diligently studied the methods taught by [Qiu Dongyue], closing her eyes happily.
0:22:5|0:22:11|Madam Qiu, in a high position, remained unmoved upon hearing this, leaning back in her chair and calmly remarked.
0:22:13|0:22:15|Madam Qiu unexpectedly said such words.
0:22:15|0:22:17|The eyes immediately turned fierce.
0:22:23|0:22:30|Concubine Lao turned around and looked at the guard Gang Gang beside [Madam Qiu]. Gang Gang remained silent, pursed his lips, and avoided her gaze.
0:22:30|0:22:42|Madam Qiu couldn't sit still anymore. A flying rope jumped down from the high chair, making a creaking sound as the wooden chair followed suit. She glared angrily at the old maid, turned around and left, with guards carrying the high chair closely behind her.
0:22:54|0:23:0|After that, Madam Qiu walked into the room and lay on the grandmaster chair with the other three grandmasters, closing their eyes to rest and recuperate.
0:23:0|0:23:8|Three foreign women, escorted by armed servants, arrived at a side room. Two more armed servants then emerged from the room.
0:23:8|0:23:16|They walked onto the deck of the merchant ship with large knives in hand, then assumed a posture of tribute, slowly kneeling and moving towards the cabin door.
0:23:16|0:23:22|The blade made a crisp sound as it hit the stick, and then the two of them staggered and collapsed to the ground.
0:23:22|0:23:29|Inside the door curtain, [Sailan] was very satisfied with the kung fu she had just learned, but when she turned around, she saw [Liang Henlu] opening the window.
0:23:35|0:23:40|After speaking, [Liang Henlu] lifted the knife and flipped over the window, then plunged into the water.
0:23:40|0:23:47|Outside the door curtain, there was a new movement again. [Sailan] held an empty long stick, waiting for the approaching servants step by step.
0:23:47|0:23:52|The servant slowly approached the door curtain, but as soon as he touched the protruding stick head, he quickly apologized and backed away.
0:23:55|0:24:0|Madam Qiu walked back in the alley, with moonlight shining on the bamboo leaves by the road, casting swaying shadows.
0:24:0|0:24:3|She was dressed in plain clothes, with a deeply melancholic expression on her face.
0:24:3|0:24:7|Carrying a high chair, [Qiu Dongyue] followed behind without saying a word.
0:24:7|0:24:10|Suddenly, Madam Qiu turned to look at her.
0:24:12|0:24:18|Madam Qiu stared at the pole motionless for a long time before finally saying slowly.
0:24:20|0:24:26|Madam Qiu's eyes gradually dimmed, she turned and continued walking forward, with Liang Henlu closely following behind.
0:24:26|0:24:30|The two of them stood facing each other in silence, and [Qiu Dongyue] left.
0:24:30|0:24:33|Liang Henlu stuck to the hidden shore underwater, observing everything.
0:24:35|0:24:50|Liang Henlu strode along the riverbank with a strong wind, forming a "mandarin duck" formation with four soldiers, three shields side by side, and two spears protruding from the gaps between the shields.
0:24:50|0:24:55|[Liu Kai] stopped in his tracks as he walked onto the bridge, confronted by the figure in front of him.
0:24:55|0:25:0|[Qiu Dongyue] saw [Liang Henlu] leisurely lying on the bridge with one foot raised, and [Liu Kai] quickly picked up his shield.
0:25:2|0:25:9|While speaking, [Liang Henlu] casually took out his sword in a hurry, as [Qiu Dongyue] closed his eyes and lazily sat up, replying nonchalantly.
0:25:13|0:25:19|[Liu Kai] finally drew the sword on his back and formed a complete Mandarin Duck formation with four other soldiers.
0:25:19|0:25:27|[Liang Henlu] finally raised his eyes when he saw the situation, picked up his sword slowly, stood up slowly, and approached the few people under the bridge.
0:25:27|0:25:31|[Liu Kai] and others showed no fear at all, and charged towards [Liang Henlu] with determination.
0:25:31|0:25:36|The power of the two spears forced [Liang Henlu] to take a few steps back, constantly searching for a breakthrough in the formation.
0:25:37|0:25:45|Liang Henlu prepared to attack the lower body with a long knife, but the three people holding shields were quick and successfully blocked Liang Henlu's sneak attack.
0:25:45|0:25:58|Following that, the spear launched an attack towards him. Liang Henlu saw the situation was not good, turned around and ran off the bridge. The "Mandarin Duck" formation, however, chased closely behind. The front ends of the two spears were actually tied with explosives, continuously closing in. The shield bearer took the opportunity to launch a close-range attack on Liang Henlu.
0:25:58|0:26:14|After the gunfire at the front end of the spear burned out, Liang Henlu was once again attacked by the spear. During the intervals of resisting the spear attacks, he was knocked down by the shield bearer.
0:26:20|0:26:25|Liu Kai saw this scene and put away his sword, taking out a bundle of hemp rope, preparing to capture Liang Henlu.
0:26:27|0:26:41|Liang Henlu stood up and embraced Liu Kai, throwing his sword aside and forcefully restraining him.
0:26:48|0:26:52|The other four soldiers immediately dropped their shields and spears.
0:26:52|0:26:58|Liang Henlu then subdued Liu Kai, with four soldiers walking ahead of the two of them towards the riverbank.
0:26:58|0:27:5|After approaching the shore, four soldiers lined up on the bottom steps, hesitating to take the next step.
0:27:10|0:27:11|Two soldiers jumped into the water.
0:27:19|0:27:23|Liang Henlu glared at Liu Kai angrily.
0:27:42|0:27:53|Liang Henlu slowly moved the long knife away from his neck and nodded to indicate that he should also get into the water. Madam Qiu forced a bitter smile on her face and then jumped into the water with a splash.
0:27:53|0:28:5|Following that, Liang Henlu also jumped into the water. When Liu Kai and the others turned around underwater, they couldn't see Liang Henlu anywhere. Liu Kai carefully observed the surroundings and then burst into laughter.
0:28:14|0:28:22|[Liu Kai] shrank his head and slowly turned around to look behind him, where Liang Henlu stood straight, staring at him, with a long knife pointed at his neck.
0:28:30|0:28:35|[Liu Kai] turned around and gave orders, and several people swam together towards the center of the river.
0:28:35|0:28:47|In the deep mountains for many years, [Qiu Dongyue] still has the same resolute look in his eyes as before. He looks at his beard, takes out a brush, dips it in ink made from wood branches, and brushes it on his beard to make himself appear younger.
0:29:13|0:29:22|Stubborn [Qiu Dongyue] finally decided to descend the mountain. When he reached the foot of the mountain, he saw the hunter from years ago, who was leaning against the door and sleeping.
0:29:25|0:29:28|The hunter stood up and scooped up a ladle of water.
0:30:9|0:30:13|[Qiu Dongyue] got up and left one or two pieces of silver on the stool, and the hunter quickly got up.
0:30:25|0:30:33|[Qiu Dongyue] left the hunter's house and arrived at a low mud house. Inside the courtyard, there were piles of firewood and salted vegetables drying on the ground.
0:30:33|0:30:37|[Gai'er] sat in the courtyard, gently patting the child in her arms.
0:30:37|0:30:40|Gai'er saw him and smiled at him.
0:31:6|0:31:12|[Qiu Dongyue] drank water, listened to the goose driver speak, took out a few pieces of silver from his clothes, and the goose driver took the silver and then got up.
0:31:16|0:31:24|Madam Qiu pushed open the door while holding the child, Qiu Dongyue sat there for a moment lost in thought, not understanding why Madam Qiu was calling her into the room.
0:31:24|0:31:38|In the room, [Madam Qiu] held a child, bent over squatting beside the bed, with a man lying on the bed with a broken leg. She whispered something to the man, who quickly got up, took the child from [Madam Qiu]'s arms, and limped out of the room.
0:31:38|0:31:43|Passing by Qiu Dongyue, he smiled and nodded at Qiu Dongyue, then casually closed the door.
0:31:44|0:31:50|[Qiu Dongyue] watched the man leave, then looked at [Madam Qiu] sitting on the bed with a puzzled expression on her face.
0:31:51|0:31:59|Madam Qiu sat by the bed and placed the silver she had just received on the bed.
0:31:59|0:32:5|[Qiu Dongyue] approached [Madam Qiu] from the doorway and looked at the silver coins on the bed placed by [Madam Qiu].
0:32:32|0:32:37|Madam Qiu finished speaking, then turned over and half knelt on the bed, pulling the corner of Qiu Dongyue's clothes with one hand.
0:32:37|0:32:44|Qiu Dongyue showed no reaction at all, and [Madam Qiu] pulled him hard a few more times before looking up at him.
0:32:59|0:33:6|Qiu Dongyue's hand gently turned, the altered hand slipped down along with his foot, and then he turned and walked towards the door.
0:33:6|0:33:11|With empty eyes, Madam Qiu sat on the bed and watched Qiu Dongyue leave.
0:33:11|0:33:18|Qiu Dongyue opened the door, took a deep breath, and saw Liang Henlu sitting at the doorway, speaking to Qiu Dongyue.
0:33:18|0:33:24|The old man, [Qiu Dongyue], turned around and looked at the man herding geese, who smiled warmly at her.
0:33:24|0:33:30|[Qiu Dongyue] ignored the man, took a few steps and then threw a few pieces of silver coins behind her.
0:33:30|0:33:37|The man saw the silver and quickly knelt down, picking up the silver and looking up at [Qiu Dongyue] with a flattering expression.
0:33:39|0:33:44|[Qiu Dongyue] left home and set off alone towards the direction of Shuangye City.
0:33:44|0:33:51|However, due to her advancing age, her physical strength is not as good as before, and she has to rest against a tree stump after walking a few steps.
0:33:51|0:33:56|Walking to the poor mine, [Qiu Dongyue] even extended her arms and made a few martial arts moves as she walked.
0:33:56|0:34:7|Entering a state of ease, [Qiu Dongyue] unburdens her shoulders, casually tossing away the baggage on them, then smoothly transitions into cloud hands, moving with a relaxed and adaptable style, displaying a variety of techniques.
0:34:8|0:34:27|His movements are mostly direct and straightforward, each move is connected, when throwing punches he is focused and agile, closely integrating body movements and footwork, as if twisting a rope all over his body. His upper body is upright, footwork is very steady, movements are firm yet not rigid, flexible yet not soft, using the spine to lead the hips, hips to lead the knees, knees to drive the feet, moving in straight lines, with power reaching all the way to the fingertips.
0:34:28|0:34:40|With the left palm rotating outward, twisting with force and delivering a straight punch upwards, then twisting inward with force and pulling back towards the waist in a defensive posture, the hands strike outward, achieving a harmonious blend of strength and flexibility, becoming one entity.
0:34:42|0:34:59|In the cargo hold of the colorful boat, three women of the Qiu family gathered together, chatting and laughing. The four elders of the four major sects lay on the grandmaster chairs, silent on the side. Although the room was filled with people, the only sounds were the chatter and laughter of women, occasionally interrupted by the creaking of the grandmaster chairs.
0:34:59|0:35:10|Madam Qiu, who was resting with her eyes closed, opened them upon hearing the commotion. She glanced in the direction of the three women, who were talking non-stop, before turning to look at Mr. Lu and Mr. Cai sitting opposite her.
0:35:12|0:35:26|In front of a group of women, there were drinks and various snacks on the floor, and they laughed louder as they spoke.
0:35:26|0:35:36|Upon receiving the order from Qie Lao, the servant turned and walked towards the three women on the side. Instead of stopping or showing any sign of respect upon seeing the servant, the three women burst into laughter again.
0:35:39|0:35:45|Master Lu saw that Madam Qiu's servant did not return, so he sent his own servant to investigate.
0:35:45|0:35:51|Two servants stood before three foreign women, looking at them with confusion, but none of them returned.
0:35:51|0:35:58|The four elders of the Four Great Gates all turned to look to the side. After a while, Lu Lao's servant turned and left, and [Madam Qiu]'s servant also turned and followed.
0:36:19|0:36:31|The four young masters of the Si Da Men burst into laughter one after another, and their attendants beside them couldn't help but laugh as well. The three foreign women, upon seeing this, all suppressed their smiles.
0:36:59|0:37:5|Cai Lao and Lu Lao nodded at each other after exchanging glances.
0:37:6|0:37:10|After speaking, they all sat back on the grandmaster chair one after another, and Mr. Wang also followed suit and agreed.
0:37:12|0:37:15|Shortly after, [Madam Qiu]'s servant walked towards the warehouse.
0:37:15|0:37:19|Just arrived at the door, a person wearing a bamboo hat walked in.
0:37:19|0:37:25|Madam Qiu, squinting her eyes, slowly opened them when she saw a figure, then lifted her head from the grandmaster chair.
0:37:25|0:37:30|The other three sect leaders all stood up from their grandmaster chairs in unison when they saw it.
0:37:30|0:37:34|Madam Qiu slowly stood up as she watched the actions of the three individuals.
0:37:34|0:37:40|After the man with a straw hat entered, instead of walking into the room, he sat on the wooden cart near the door.
0:37:42|0:37:51|Afterwards, [Qiu Dongyue] untied the gourd containing wine from his waist, took a few sips, and silently watched the people in the room, while [Madam Qiu] kept looking at the person at the door.
0:37:56|0:38:2|[Qiu Dongyue] covered half of her face with a bamboo hat, but the people present still recognized her.
0:38:6|0:38:12|In the cabin, [Madam Qiu] grasped a long stick with both hands, leaned back with her neck arched, and rested wearily on the chair.
0:38:12|0:38:20|Outside the boat, there was another strange noise. [Qiu Dongyue] immediately became highly alert. She slowly extended the long stick in her hand towards the curtain again.
0:38:20|0:38:29|Outside the bed, the heads of the four major sects sat side by side on chairs, with two servants holding long-handled broadswords in front of them, turning towards the direction of the boat.
0:38:29|0:38:37|After quickly jumping onto the deck, [Qiu Dongyue] swung the knife towards the stick, but fell to the ground as soon as he made a move.
0:38:37|0:38:40|The heads of the four major sects couldn't sit still after seeing this.
0:38:59|0:39:10|In our Central Plains martial arts, Master Wang still wanted to continue explaining to the three foreign women, but was interrupted by Master Qie's two clear coughs. The three foreign women shrugged their shoulders, indicating their confusion.
0:39:10|0:39:18|Following that, four servants walked along the bank, carrying a boat-shaped stretcher, heading towards the two servants who had collapsed on the deck.
0:40:26|0:40:30|Qiu Dongyue carefully analyzed the direction of the boat.
0:40:30|0:40:33|The servants also placed the unconscious person into a stretcher on the boat.
0:41:6|0:41:20|[Qiu Dongyue] lowered his head and pondered for a moment. With the people from the four major sects, he arrived at the warehouse. He paced back and forth, and the atmosphere remained tense. The leaders of the four sects kept a close eye on [Qiu Dongyue], each one waiting for him to speak.
0:42:11|0:42:19|Three women of the Qiu family sat on the ground in the cargo hold. At mealtime, the servants brought snacks and drinks, and the three of them happily chatted again for a few days.
0:42:23|0:42:28|Qiu Dongyue watched as these young exotic women touched the stubble on their own chins.
0:42:36|0:42:40|The beards of the four grandmasters all show visible signs of aging.
0:42:40|0:42:44|At this moment, Madam Qiu's beard seemed somewhat out of place.
0:42:44|0:42:48|After the meal, [Madam Qiu] is ready to take action herself.
0:42:48|0:42:55|Under the gaze of the four sect leaders, dozens of servants, and three exotic women, he walked towards the direction of the boat.
0:42:55|0:43:0|He strode towards the steps by the shore, stepped onto the boarding plank, and arrived on the deck of the fishing boat.
0:43:0|0:43:5|Standing behind the cabin door, he unfastened the rope buckle on his chest, and the wound on his back fell down naturally.
0:43:9|0:43:15|Madam Qiu quickly grabbed the two guns.
0:43:15|0:43:29|Madam Qiu already had a method to kill with one shot in her heart, the move had already rehearsed in her mind.
0:43:29|0:43:33|Once the position of the head is confirmed, the person inside the door will die instantly.
0:43:41|0:43:43|The enemy has not launched the second attack yet.
0:44:4|0:44:14|[Qiu Dongyue] caught the flaw in Ru Xiang's plan, calculating that when it was time to strike, her skills would be agile enough to dodge in advance, still able to deliver a fatal blow to the enemy.
0:44:14|0:44:18|The four sect leaders on the bank, along with dozens of servants, all eagerly awaited.
0:44:29|0:44:38|[Qiu Dongyue] thought of herself as the top martial artist in the martial arts world, feeling that her previous approach was not righteous enough. Therefore, she decided to abandon her skills and use straightforward kung fu to attack.
0:44:38|0:44:49|He once again calculated in his mind, thinking that with his own skills, he could easily make the people inside the door lose their lives. With various methods to win in one move, he was already clear in his mind.
0:44:55|0:45:10|In the end, he decided to confront the people inside the door in the second way. He crossed the two guns in front of his chest, and the person inside the door lifted the head of the stick. The people on the shore watched nervously as Qiu Dongyue approached and tapped the stick head with the gun.
0:45:10|0:45:20|In his mind, he had already dodged the attack of the stick, but in reality, his body had only moved half an inch, and the stick had accurately hit his neck.
0:46:25|0:46:38|After Liu Kai finished speaking angrily, [Liang Henlu] remained calm, looking at Liu Kai with indifference. He silently raised the long knife underwater and pointed it towards Liu Kai.
0:46:38|0:46:42|Liu Kai moved the long knife away from his face with his hand.
0:46:51|0:46:53|The two [Qiu Dongyue] slowly put down their long knives.
0:47:13|0:47:18|Liu Kai turned around and waved his hand, leading his men to swim forward again.
0:47:18|0:47:27|[Liang Henlu] followed closely behind, the kettle filled with tea water by the riverbank had already boiled completely, and thick mist kept pouring out from the kettle lid and spout.
0:47:27|0:47:40|Qiu Dongyue, who fainted on the ground, has been carried into a stretcher by the servants. In order to cover up his aging beard, he secretly tied up his long and fierce beard with a beard bag. At this moment, it has fallen off during the fight, looking extremely embarrassed.
0:47:50|0:47:54|Following behind the stretcher on the boat, Madam Qiu walked towards Qiu Dongyue's former home.
0:47:54|0:48:9|Halfway through, Qiu Dongyue's consciousness slowly returned. He let out a breath and weakly said.
0:48:12|0:48:16|Upon hearing Qie Lao's command, Piao Yi turned and walked in the opposite direction.
0:48:30|0:48:35|Upon hearing this, Qiu Dongyue and Liang Henlu placed him in the courtyard outside the main hall.
0:48:35|0:48:38|Qiu Dongyue made a move, causing the people around him to leave.
0:48:38|0:48:42|After Pu Yi left, he took a few steps towards Qiu Dongyue.
0:48:44|0:48:49|Without facing [Qiu Dongyue], he walked to the pillar and then spoke.
0:50:32|0:50:36|Qiu Dongyue leaned back against the stretcher behind him, allowing his upper body to relax.
0:50:45|0:50:55|Upon hearing what Qiu Dongyue said, [Madam Qiu] slowly turned around to look at him. She seemed like she wanted to say something, but then stopped herself. Instead, she bent down and leaned in closer to Qiu Dongyue to speak.
0:52:19|0:52:24|Qiu Dongyue briefly explained and then closed his eyes again, unwilling to listen to Madam Qiu's words.
0:52:26|0:52:30|On the colorful boat by the river of nostalgia, everything remains the same as before.
0:52:30|0:52:36|The three sect leaders and three foreign girls were lying in the cargo hold, each in a different position, resting.
0:52:36|0:52:40|On the deck of the colorful boat, one warrior after another fell.
0:52:40|0:52:45|On the other side, with Liang Henlu's permission, Liu Kai and the soldiers finally climbed up the bank.
0:52:45|0:52:50|Liang Henlu lay beside the pile of cue sticks, picked up a piece with his hand, and put it into his mouth.
0:52:57|0:53:2|Liang Henlu turned to look at Liu Kai and took the cue stick out of his mouth.
0:53:5|0:53:9|Liang Henlu took out a bundle of hemp rope from his chest and threw it to [Liu Kai].
0:53:9|0:53:12|[Liu Kai] picked up the hemp rope and immediately understood.
0:53:15|0:53:22|[Liu Kai] successively tied the hands and feet of the four soldiers, then handed the remaining piece of hemp rope to Liang Henlu.
0:53:22|0:53:26|Liang Henlu looked at the hemp rope, then glanced at [Liu Kai], a sly smile appearing at the corner of his mouth.
0:53:55|0:53:57|The specially made paper solidifies afterwards.
0:54:7|0:54:15|After finishing speaking, Qiu Dongyue bit the stick handed to her by Liang Henlu, and once everything was tied up, she obediently squeezed in with the four soldiers.
0:54:15|0:54:19|Liang Henlu picked up a street pole and threw it on them, hiding them under the pile of street poles.
0:54:20|0:54:29|Qiu Dongyue lay on the carpet in the hall, resting. He kept using his left hand to pat his right arm, mechanically repeating this action over and over.
0:54:29|0:54:37|Suddenly, he unfastened the wristband on his left arm, pulled it off, and quickly got up to walk towards the door.
0:54:37|0:54:45|The old man sweeping the floor in the Qie Lao Mansion slowly walked down from upstairs, holding a weapon in his hands, looking quite important.
0:54:45|0:54:51|He arrived at the gate holding a weapon, while [Qiu Dongyue] was organizing his ten thousand sets.
0:54:51|0:54:58|The old man sweeping the floor stood beside him, not interrupting his movements, just holding the weapon, bowing and waiting.
0:54:58|0:55:7|When [Qiu Dongyue] was ready, he reached out his hand to the side, and the old man quickly handed him the weapon.
0:55:34|0:55:39|Qiu Dongyue refused the escort of the personal bodyguard and left home alone with a weapon in hand.
0:55:39|0:55:45|He arrived at a deserted place, quietly standing on the bridge, looking around anxiously.
0:55:45|0:55:54|After making sure no one was around, he put down the weapon on his shoulder, held it in both hands, rang it for a while, and quickly lifted the cloth covering the weapon.
0:55:54|0:55:59|A Taiji whip appeared, known as the Taiji whip in the martial arts world.
0:56:0|0:56:11|[Qiu Dongyue] wields the whip with great strength and fierceness, the movements are intense and powerful, the whip whistles through the air, fast yet controlled, appearing to have endless variations while maintaining agility in both offense and defense.
0:56:11|0:56:18|At this moment, [Qiu Dongyue] was still unaware of the events happening in the mansion. The fire in the prison cell had long been extinguished, leaving only some residual smoke drifting in the room.
0:56:39|0:56:49|Rapidly rushing over, [Qiu Dongyue] cut the hemp rope on his left wrist and foot, caught him steadily, and then carried him out.
0:56:49|0:56:55|He hesitated for a moment, but fearing someone might suddenly come, he ran non-stop towards the outside.
0:56:55|0:56:57|After running a few steps, he stopped again.
0:57:0|0:57:5|Qiu Dongyue refused [Liang Henlu] when he tried to pull out the long knife from the beam.
0:57:5|0:57:10|He was very puzzled, but still carried Qiu Dongyue back to the pile of cue sticks.
0:57:10|0:57:18|After putting down [Qiu Dongyue], he tore open the clothes on [Qiu Dongyue]'s calf, causing [Qiu Dongyue] to grimace in pain.
0:57:45|0:57:51|Upon hearing these words from [Qiu Dongyue], [Liang Henlu] stared at him with wide eyes, unable to believe that those words came from him.
0:58:5|0:58:8|After speaking, [Qiu Dongyue] turned towards the shore without hesitation.
0:58:8|0:58:13|Liu Kai and his men in the crowded street were dumbfounded as they watched this scene.
0:58:13|0:58:16|[Liang Henlu] picked up the long knife and scabbard on the ground, looking coldly at [Qiu Dongyue].
0:58:27|0:58:32|After tossing the scabbard to [Qiu Dongyue], Liang Henlu strode away from the riverbank.
0:58:32|0:58:35|Liang Henlu picked up a stick and then threw it into the river.
0:58:35|0:58:40|When everything outside had calmed down, the people tied up in the haystack finally breathed a sigh of relief.
0:58:44|0:58:51|At this moment, while the colorful boat was surrounded by lively singing and dancing on the shore, the three sect leaders stood solemnly on the high platform, gazing down at the audience.
0:58:51|0:58:59|In the audience, three exotic women are dancing, lifting their skirts and swaying rhythmically to the music.
0:58:59|0:59:5|Dozens of sword-wielding warriors sat on both sides, all staring intently as the three of them danced.
0:59:5|0:59:12|The three of them became more and more unrestrained in their movements, swaying their waists. Even the servant who was boiling water in the distance couldn't help but look over.
0:59:13|0:59:19|Suddenly, Madam Qiu arrived at the riverside with a riding crop in hand, and the servants who were boiling water quickly stood up and saluted.
0:59:19|0:59:30|Madam Qiu glared angrily at the scene, but to her dismay, dozens of people on the shore were all engrossed in the pensive demeanor of the foreign woman, Aluo, and no one noticed her arrival.
0:59:30|0:59:32|She walked up to Mr. Lu and asked:
0:59:50|0:59:56|Madam Qiu looked at the group of women swaying their waists below the stage, and asked Mr. Lu again. Mr. Lu replied.
1:0:0|1:0:10|Qiu Dongyue circled around Mr. Lu, her eyes never leaving him for a moment. After she sat down in the center, Madam Qiu said, "[Wang Lao]."
1:0:18|1:0:30|[Wang Lao] smiled with one corner of his mouth, and at this moment, the three foreign women stopped dancing.
1:0:30|1:0:40|They rushed onto the stage, surrounded Madam Qiu and clamored for wine. Seeing Madam Qiu not responding, they spoke in a local dialect that only they could understand, which made them burst into laughter.
1:0:40|1:0:42|Madam Qiu closed her eyes and leaned back against the chair behind her.
1:0:51|1:1:3|On the other side of the street, Liu Kai and the others saw Madam Qiu passing by. They tried to attract her attention with some noises, but Madam Qiu remained oblivious and just kept walking forward.
1:1:3|1:1:11|Qiu Dongyue, who was resting with his eyes closed, immediately opened his eyes upon hearing footsteps. He then picked up the empty bag beside him and placed it on his chin where his beard was.
1:1:16|1:1:21|Madam Jiu, wearing a bamboo hat, walked towards the stretcher where Qiu Dongyue was lying on the boat.
1:1:21|1:1:26|She had a cold expression, lifted her dress hem, and squatted beside [Qiu Dongyue].
1:1:26|1:1:31|The sun in front of her face was suddenly blocked, Qiu Dongyue furrowed her brows slightly and opened her eyes.
1:2:20|1:2:24|Madam Qiu clenched the dagger in her hands, pointing the blade towards Qiu Dongyue's chest.
1:2:24|1:2:35|Afterwards, with her eyes closed, just as she was about to end Qiu Dongyue with a single stroke, a noise came from behind her.
1:2:35|1:2:40|She stood up and looked towards the direction of life, seeing someone throwing firewood into the backyard.
1:2:42|1:2:48|He walked into the backyard, sneaking up to the wall to observe, and saw [Liang Henlu] carrying firewood.
1:2:48|1:3:1|In an instant, the two locked eyes, [Liang Henlu] set down the firewood on his shoulder and clenched his fist.
1:3:1|1:3:7|After just a few moves, [Liang Henlu]'s broadsword was already at the neck of [Madam Qiu], but she remained calm.
1:3:14|1:3:20|The two temporarily reconciled, with [Liang Henlu] sitting on a pile of firewood, constantly striking a flint.
1:4:16|1:4:25|Qiu Dongyue overheard the conversation between the two in the stretcher passing by the front yard.
1:4:25|1:4:33|[Liang Henlu], after getting the response from [Madam Qiu], dropped the food in his hand, picked up a long knife, and led her to the other side.
1:4:33|1:4:39|The two arrived at a side room, where [Liang Henlu] took out a hemp rope several meters long and hung it on the lantern hanging high at the door.
1:4:41|1:4:49|Suddenly, footsteps were heard coming from the side corridor. [Liang Henlu] and [Madam Qiu] quickly retreated into the room and closed the door.
1:4:49|1:4:55|At the moment the door closed, two servants came out from the corridor carrying wine and a stone box.
1:4:55|1:5:0|After the two of them walked away, [Liang Henlu] began the next step of the operation.
1:5:0|1:5:7|Half an hour before dark, with the lanterns in these two angles, the shadows will arrive before the people do.
1:5:10|1:5:15|[Liang Henlu] drew a point on the ground with a long knife, then reached out a hand towards [Madam Qiu].
1:5:16|1:5:21|[Liang Henlu] looked at the earrings of [Madam Qiu], then reached out his hand.
1:5:21|1:5:28|When Madam Qiu was taking off her earrings, Liang Henlu cut the hemp rope in half with a long knife, and half of the hemp rope fell on Madam Qiu.
1:5:28|1:5:32|[Liang Henlu] stared at [Madam Qiu], slowly retracting the hemp rope from her body.
1:5:34|1:5:53|Throughout the scene, [Madam Qiu] never took her eyes off [Liang Henlu]. Instead of responding to her gaze, [Liang Henlu] naturally lowered his head, twisted a hemp rope, tucked it into his clothes, and then reached out a hand towards [Madam Qiu]. She handed him the earring.
1:5:53|1:5:59|[Liang Henlu] placed the earring at the designated spot and both of them stood up.
1:5:59|1:6:1|When the shadow reached the earring above [Madam Qiu]'s head,
1:6:15|1:6:22|Liang Henlu looked straight into her eyes, took a step closer to her, and pressed against Madam Qiu's arm.
1:6:22|1:6:25|After watching for a while, [Qiu Dongyue] picked up a long stick in the room.
1:6:42|1:6:46|Madam Qiu dropped the long stick, took out a dagger, and quickly stabbed towards Liang Henlu.
1:7:7|1:7:19|After speaking, Liang Henlu carried two lanterns in the room and walked towards the door, then hung the lanterns on the hooks above the beams.
1:7:19|1:7:24|With a long knife in hand, [Qiu Dongyue] gave a push upwards, and the two lanterns hung steadily above.
1:7:36|1:7:43|On the bank of the Qinhuai River, three foreign women were already making a racket, urging the warriors to dance together.
1:7:43|1:7:49|A warrior, upon seeing this scene, threw down his big sword and stood up, starting to dance.
1:7:49|1:7:53|Dozens of samurais around watched her dance in a daze, all indifferent.
1:7:54|1:8:12|Three exotic women stood up to greet, the warrior indulged in wandering between them. Suddenly, Madam Qiu appeared behind him and swung the Tai Chi whip in her hand towards the warrior, who instantly fainted to the ground.
1:8:29|1:8:45|After Mr. Qi finished speaking, he seemed to be staring in the direction of the boat, while the leaders of the other three sects exchanged glances with each other.
1:8:45|1:8:50|Three foreign women were escorted into the dungeon in terror.
1:8:56|1:9:6|The leading warrior, Qiu Dongyue, stared straight at the three foreign women, while the four people behind her followed her steps and approached the foreign women, closing the gate of the water dungeon.
1:9:6|1:9:10|The foreign woman embraced each other, fearfully stepping back repeatedly.
1:9:40|1:9:50|The leading warrior turned around to look at the person behind him, took off the wooden hairpin from his own head, then took off others', held them in his hand, and broke the hairpins, holding one end in his palm.
1:9:59|1:10:8|The other four warriors each took a wooden hairpin and stood in the corner. A woman from the family stood with her hands crossed over her chest, watching them with interest.
1:10:15|1:10:37|The leading samurai, upon hearing this, turned to look at a group of women. After a moment of thought, she turned back to look at the other samurai. Before she could react, the others had already turned to the water to retrieve weapons. Once everyone had their weapons, the fighting among the samurai began. As the sound of swords clashing was heard, they all screamed and moved closer to the corner of the wall.
1:10:37|1:10:44|Inside the water dungeon, apart from the screams of women, there was only the sound of swords clashing between warriors. After a while, the fighting finally ceased.
1:10:45|1:11:4|In the water dungeon, silence prevailed. A group of women hiding in the corner looked up to see only one warrior left lying at the stone steps of the dungeon gate.
1:11:4|1:11:8|He shook as he looked at the fallen warrior, unable to hold back his tears.
1:11:8|1:11:11|After pausing for a moment, he turned and walked towards a group of women in the corner.
1:11:19|1:11:32|A woman from the Qiu family, holding a long knife that she had picked up at some point, attacked from both sides and knocked the warrior unconscious.
1:11:32|1:11:38|A female member of the escaped family arrived at the back yard of the concubine's residence and approached the pile of poles, intending to use it to climb over the wall.
1:11:38|1:11:41|Suddenly, several people emerged from the pile of cue sticks beside them.
1:11:48|1:11:55|The five people from the Liu Kai gang in the street market, with their feet tied with hemp ropes, could only hop towards a group of women.
1:11:55|1:12:3|A woman from the Qiu family retreated in fear upon seeing this, while on the other side, a pot of scalding hot oil had already come to a boil on the bank of the Qinhuai River.
1:12:3|1:12:11|Madam Qiu sat in a chair, propping her head with one hand, pretending to be lost in thought, while a servant added a bucket of cold oil to the hot pot.
1:12:20|1:12:27|The servant continued to add grains and oil inside, suddenly, there was a sound of swords clashing on the shore.
1:12:35|1:12:39|A warrior saw someone falling in battle and approached alone.
1:12:39|1:12:42|He wielded a long-handled broadsword and chopped towards the long handle of the lever.
1:12:42|1:12:47|The lever pushed forward, and the axe tore through the warrior's clothes.
1:12:47|1:12:52|The warrior looked down at his legs, his clothes were all torn, but his flesh remained unharmed.
1:12:52|1:12:55|His legs started trembling uncontrollably.
1:12:55|1:12:58|The concubine on the high platform saw this and walked down to the side of the warrior.
1:13:5|1:13:8|The warrior retreated after receiving orders from [Madam Qiu].
1:13:8|1:13:14|Madam Qiu struck a martial arts pose, and Gan Gang placed the long-handled axe's wooden handle on Madam Qiu's arm.
1:13:14|1:13:20|Shortly after, [Madam Qiu] made a slight move, before Gang Han could resist, he knelt down on the ground.
1:13:20|1:13:23|Gan Gang looked up at [Madam Qiu] and said.
1:13:40|1:13:45|My young lady... Qian Lao suddenly had a cold look in her eyes, which made me shudder just now.
1:14:5|1:14:12|Mr. Xie took off his personal jade pendant from his waist and half-squatted to pick it up.
1:14:32|1:14:35|Since he retired to the mountain.
1:15:9|1:15:17|Upon hearing this, [Qiu Dongyue] clenched his fists tightly, suppressing the anger in his heart with all his might.
1:15:17|1:15:24|Gan Gang gritted his teeth and finished speaking, took a few steps back, turned around and left the shore, while Qie Lao put the Tai Shi whip back on the rack.
1:15:28|1:15:36|At this moment, inside the concubine's residence, [Madam Qiu] stood at the door holding a long wooden stick, with two lanterns lit on the door. She shouted loudly towards the front courtyard.
1:15:42|1:15:50|After shouting loudly, he walked into the room, holding a stick and hiding behind the door, fully focused on staring at the spot where [Liang Henlu] placed the earring.
1:15:50|1:15:56|After a moment, the warriors in the front yard heard a noise and gathered in the backyard with their long knives.
1:15:56|1:16:4|After observing the situation, a warrior slowly walked towards the house with a knife in hand, his shadow reflected inside the house, the shadow's head gradually approaching the earring.
1:16:8|1:16:13|Madam Qiu seized the opportunity and struck, causing the first samurai to fall to the ground and not get up.
1:16:13|1:16:19|In a colorful boat on the Qinhuai River, [Sailan] takes a brief rest inside the boat, holding a long stick.
1:16:19|1:16:25|A noise came from the window behind, and [Liang Henlu] climbed in from outside.
1:16:25|1:16:32|She looked at [Madam Qiu] at the door, gently withdrew the long knife, but [Madam Qiu] woke up immediately.
1:16:35|1:16:37|Sailan finished speaking and fainted on the ground.
1:16:37|1:16:41|[Liang Henlu] slowly poured water for him while holding a water jug.
1:16:41|1:16:45|Sailan, awakened by water, snatched the water bottle and drank it up vigorously.
1:16:45|1:16:48|[Liang Henlu] smiled when he saw it.
1:17:31|1:17:35|Upon hearing this, [Liang Henlu] didn't say anything more, just looked at Madam Qiu.
1:17:35|1:17:49|By the bank of the Qinhuai River, Qiu Dongyue watched the boiling oil in the wok, took the water ladle handed to her by Lu Lao, and scooped up a ladleful of hot oil from the sizzling wok in front of her.
1:17:49|1:17:56|Later, [Qiu Dongyue] walked slowly to the edge of the Tai Chi field, starting from the edge, and poured hot oil little by little onto the edge of the Tai Chi field.
1:17:56|1:18:0|As soon as Qiu Dongyue's body touched the hot oil, it made a sizzling sound.
1:18:3|1:18:13|After Gan Gang left the riverside and headed straight to the Qiu Mansion, Qiu Dongyue, who was lying in the middle of the courtyard, heard footsteps and threw the hat dropped by Madam Qiu towards a distance.
1:19:29|1:19:46|After speaking, two servants lifted the sedan chair and carried Madam Qiu to the backyard.
1:19:46|1:19:54|The sword-wielding warriors stepped aside, allowing [Qiu Dongyue] to pass through them and be placed by the servants in the bright spot in front of the door.
1:19:54|1:19:58|A warrior walked into the house with a sword in hand, as [Qiu Dongyue] said to the person next to her.
1:20:8|1:20:14|Gan Gang looked at the warrior, only to see the warrior holding a knife, swiftly rushing towards the doorway and stopping.
1:20:14|1:20:18|Madam Qiu in the room immediately became alert, staring at the earring.
1:20:18|1:20:25|Before the warrior outside the door could step into the house, he was struck on the head by Madam Qiu and immediately fainted to the ground.
1:20:28|1:20:31|[Qiu Dongyue] speaks to Gan Gang again.
1:22:0|1:22:9|On the other side of the colorful boat, [Liang Henlu] lay on the ground, his eyes filled with drowsiness, but he dared not relax, still carefully listening to the sounds outside.
1:22:9|1:22:15|Sailan slept heavily on his legs, while Qie Lao walked down from the high platform with a Tai Chi whip in his hand.
1:22:46|1:22:55|Stopping near the ship's curtain, he looked at it and recalled the scene when [Qiu Dongyue] retreated to the mountains for seclusion.
1:23:11|1:23:27|He calculated in his mind the attacking moves, thinking about how to use the Tai Chi whip to suppress the opponent's long stick.
1:23:27|1:23:34|Confident in his calculated steps, he gently approached the extended long stick of [Liang Henlu] with the head of the Tai Chi whip.
1:23:38|1:23:43|As the stick was about to hit Qie Lao's face, he quickly blocked and counterattacked swiftly.
1:23:43|1:23:51|After exchanging signals, Sairan and [Liang Henlu] cooperated to resist the Tai Chi whip thrust by Qie Lao, and then deflected Qie Lao's whip head.
1:23:51|1:23:55|At that moment, Qie Lao could only retreat to a safe zone.
1:23:55|1:24:5|The three sect leaders on the high platform could have killed him, but they hesitated and kept an eye on the long stick in Qiu Dongyue's hand.
1:24:13|1:24:23|In the mansion, under the guidance of Qiu Dongyue, Gan Gang carefully picked up the long-handled axe in his hand and cautiously moved the lantern on the door forward by an inch.
1:24:23|1:24:27|Qiu Dongyue propped himself up in the sedan chair and looked at Gan Gang.
1:24:27|1:24:39|Slightly adjusting the position of the lantern, Gan Gang slowly extended the big axe into the room. [Madam Qiu], who was resting with her eyes closed, immediately became alert, opened her eyes, gripped the long stick in her hand, and stared at the earring on the ground.
1:24:43|1:24:51|After the shadow's head and ear pendant overlapped, [Madam Qiu] swung outwards, but missed, and the long-handled axe of Gan Gang slid behind the door.
1:24:51|1:24:58|Madam Qiu quickly changed direction and, after arriving at the left door, Gan Gang once again took a swing and hit Madam Qiu solidly with a stick.
1:24:58|1:25:7|At the same time, [Madam Qiu] was also struck by Gan Gang's long-handled axe, blood seeping from her clothes, and finally she leaned against the door frame, unable to kneel up.
1:25:8|1:25:15|[Qiu Dongyue] saw the two men fall to the ground, relaxed her upper body, and silently lay back in the room where the transmission was taking place.
1:25:15|1:25:25|All that just happened was a fantasy in Qiu Dongyue's mind. This move is a mutually destructive tactic, once used, Madam Qiu and the lever will both perish.
1:25:25|1:25:37|But [Qiu Dongyue] already had a plan to save herself in mind. She propped up her upper body with effort, carefully observing the doorway, adjusting her breathing, gripping the long-handled axe in her hand, ready to make her move.
1:25:39|1:25:43|Madam Qiu, inside the door, fell to her death, always prepared.
1:25:43|1:25:48|Qiu Dongyue slowly walked towards the house, the shadow getting closer.
1:25:48|1:25:56|At the moment when Madam Qiu's stick was extended and the lever's big axe was lifted up, Qiu Dongyue quickly acted, reaching into the house with the dual guns in hand.
1:25:56|1:26:2|A shot sent the long handle of the big axe flying, hitting the stick head extended by Madam Qiu.
1:26:4|1:26:14|Madam Qiu was hit by her own stick, which rebounded and hit the lever, causing both of them to fall to the ground. Qiu Dongyue collapsed inside the stretcher.
1:26:18|1:26:22|Madam Qiu clenched her fists upon hearing this, then turned around and said a sentence.
1:26:24|1:26:27|After speaking, [Qiu Dongyue] turned to look at [Liang Henlu].
1:26:27|1:26:34|After walking a few steps, facing the door curtain, he half-bent his knees, raised the Tai Chi whip, and moved forward step by step.
1:26:34|1:26:36|He watched carefully, staring at the stick head deep inside the door curtain.
1:26:38|1:26:43|Slowly bring the tip of the Tai Chi whip closer to the stick body, then quickly strike the stick body.
1:26:43|1:26:51|Inside the door curtain, [Liang Henlu] quickly pulled back the long stick with the help of Sailan. The moment the stick disappeared, [Qiu Dongyue] was stunned.
1:26:51|1:26:58|In the moment he hesitated, [Liang Henlu] swiftly sent out his stick, and as [Qiu Dongyue] grabbed onto it, Sairan pulled the stick back.
1:26:59|1:27:2|Quickly sent out the stick while [Qiu Dongyue] was off guard.
1:27:2|1:27:10|In the blink of an eye, [Qiu Dongyue] was a beat too slow and the stick struck him directly on the face.
1:27:10|1:27:13|Shortly after, [Qiu Dongyue] fell backwards onto the ground.
1:27:13|1:27:17|Liang Henlu saw Qiu Dongyue fall to the ground through the door curtain, so he withdrew his stick.
1:27:19|1:27:26|At this moment, the quiet Chevene was only filled with the chirping of crickets. [Qiu Dongyue] fainted on the ground, slowly regaining consciousness.
1:27:26|1:27:41|He opened his eyes, trying hard to regain consciousness. Madam Qiu, who had fainted by the door, also woke up. He looked up and saw that the person outside the door was actually Qiu Dongyue. He stepped over the fallen warrior, got up, and walked towards Qiu Dongyue.
1:27:41|1:27:46|[Qiu Dongyue] at this moment also made an effort to prop himself up and saw Madam Qiu walking towards him.
1:27:48|1:27:56|Madam Qiu squatted beside Qiu Dongyue, and the two of them held each other tightly.
1:27:56|1:28:2|Qiu Dongyue saw the two embracing each other, leaned back, and lay back in the stretcher.
1:28:2|1:28:6|At this moment, she looked at the pitch-black sky, feeling extremely conflicted inside.
1:28:6|1:28:13|She could have let both of them perish and save her own reputation, but in the end, she let it go.
1:28:15|1:28:20|Several samurais stood aside with their swords, silently watching the scene in front of them.
1:28:20|1:28:29|Suddenly, a man's voice came from behind.
1:28:37|1:28:40|Upon closer inspection, the warriors realized it was [Liang Henlu] who had arrived.
1:28:40|1:28:46|He took three steps forward and drew his long sword. 
1:28:46|1:28:51|He strides forward, blocking left and right, and calls the four warriors in front to come forward.
1:28:51|1:28:55|Qiu Dongyue lay on the stretcher, looking at the scene weakly.
1:28:55|1:28:59|And just now, the two who had narrowly experienced a life-and-death separation, Madam Qiu and Qiu Dongyue, still embraced each other.
1:29:16|1:29:28|Just as Qiu Dongyue defeated four warriors in the left chamber, three foreign women and [Liang Henlu] appeared behind him.
1:29:28|1:29:30|Qiu Dongyue raised the long knife in his left hand, preparing to fight.
1:29:33|1:29:41|[Liu Kai] and two other soldiers snatched the shield from a woman of a certain tribe, while two soldiers behind them held spears with hidden firearms.
1:29:41|1:29:51|Faced with such a lineup, Qiu Dongyue found it difficult to resist and could only flee outward. However, the Mandarin Duck Formation pursued closely, with three female members of the family following closely behind.
1:29:51|1:29:58|After running for a while, the injured right leg forced Qiu Dongyue to stop, and Liu Kai as well as four soldiers were already exhausted.
1:29:59|1:30:13|Liang Henlu fought desperately, knocking down the soldiers one after another. [Liu Kai] held a shield in front of his chest, engaging in a fierce battle with the left-leaning fighter wielding a long knife.
1:30:13|1:30:17|In the end, in close combat, the long knife failed to show its advantage, and [Liang Henlu] was pinned down by Liu Kai.
1:30:40|1:30:44|Three women of different ethnicities playfully bicker with each other and run away from the scene.
1:30:44|1:30:47|Liu Kai also fainted next to [Liang Henlu]'s room.
1:30:47|1:30:52|The concubine who fainted halfway down was placed in a stretcher by four servants and carried off the boat.
1:30:52|1:31:2|Soon after, dozens of archers gathered on the shore, pulling their bows and strings, while two servants carried hundreds of arrows and placed them to the side.
1:31:2|1:31:6|The heads of the three major sects walked to the front of the formation, and Old Cai spoke to the people on the boat.
1:31:43|1:31:47|Upon hearing the words from the people on the shore, [Qiu Dongyue] silently retracted the stick.
1:31:47|1:31:51|Mr. Wang and Mr. Cai glanced at each other, then looked back towards the direction of the boat.
1:31:54|1:32:5|The ship finally showed some movement. The water surface made noises along with the movement on the ship, and dozens of archers on the shore aimed their bows at the ship.
1:32:5|1:32:18|[Liang Henlu] slowly walked out from the ship, holding a long stick as she stood on the deck. However, seeing the archers' posture, she shifted the long stick to her side, ready to draw her long knife at any moment to engage in battle.
1:32:18|1:32:24|The four major sects still adhered to the agreement. The next morning, [Liang Henlu] walked in the vast alley.
1:32:30|1:32:36|Approaching the first door, [Qiu Dongyue] stood in the courtyard, extending her right hand to signal [Liang Henlu] to move back.
1:32:36|1:32:41|[Liang Henlu] and Zuo Pianshi had not yet drawn their swords when they passed through the first gate.
1:32:41|1:32:46|They raised their eyes and walked towards the second door.
1:32:46|1:32:49|In front of the second gate.
1:32:50|1:32:54|Lao Lu saw the two of them and immediately put down the bow and arrow in his hand.
1:32:54|1:33:0|The two of them, with the knife still in their hands and not yet drawn out, smoothly passed through the second gate.
1:33:0|1:33:5|When they arrived at the third gate, the two of them first saw the Tai Chi whip extended by Old Cai.
1:33:5|1:33:7|Facing each other, Mr. Cai saw the two of them.
1:33:10|1:33:16|Upon seeing Cai Lao put down the Tai Chi whip, the two of them turned around and walked towards the fourth door.
1:33:16|1:33:19|As they approached the fourth door, Qiu Dongyue and Liang Henlu still had some worries in their hearts.
1:33:21|1:33:29|After a brief pause in place, the two of them continued towards the fourth door, gripping the long stick trailing behind them.
1:33:29|1:33:41|Approaching the fourth gate step by step, which is the final unexpected challenge, [Madam Qiu] holds a Tai Chi whip, with [Liang Henlu] standing beside her holding dual guns. The two outside the gate and the two inside the gate gaze at each other.
1:33:42|1:33:46|Later, [Qiu Dongyue] and [Liang Henlu] walked into the courtyard together.
1:33:46|1:33:54|After standing still in the courtyard for a moment, seeing no movement from [Madam Qiu] and [Liang Henlu], the two of them took the initiative to approach.
1:33:54|1:33:59|Their eyes met, signaling the start of the war, yet the smell of gunpowder had already filled the air.
1:33:59|1:34:5|At this moment, Mr. Lu, Mr. Wang, and Mr. Cai rushed into the concubine's residence.
1:34:5|1:34:11|After the three of them entered the courtyard, they tightly closed the main gate of the mansion, not allowing any dentists to enter.
1:34:13|1:34:24|After the closing of the door, the courtyard fell into silence once again, without any movement. It was [Madam Qiu] who first broke the silence.
1:34:24|1:34:33|He extended the Tai Chi whip towards [Qiu Dongyue], who responded alertly. In the exchange between the two, both sides ended up in a deadlock.
1:34:33|1:34:41|The long knife wielded by Liang Henlu has already blocked in front of [Madam Qiu], while Madam Qiu's Tai Chi whip is also pressed against Liang Henlu's neck.
1:34:58|1:35:5|After listening to what Madam Qiu said, Qiu Dongyue's body slightly shook backwards, then Madam Qiu retracted her Tai Chi whip and turned to walk away.
1:35:5|1:35:8|Zuopian Shi also stood under the eaves with [Madam Qiu].
1:35:11|1:35:15|In the courtyard, only Qiu Dongyue and [Liang Henlu] were left.
1:35:15|1:35:24|Qiu Dongyue nodded at him, [Liang Henlu] also responded to Qiu Dongyue, then quickly squatted down, gripping the handle of the knife with his right hand.
1:36:23|1:36:32|[Qiu Dongyue] looked at [Liang Henlu], took off the cumbersome coat, and casually threw it to the young man behind her.
1:36:38|1:36:44|[Qiu Dongyue] stepped back, then moved diagonally to the left, and quickly moved diagonally to the right.
1:36:46|1:36:51|[Liang Henlu] first declared himself emperor with a knife, then immediately switched the short knife to a long knife.
1:36:51|1:36:57|Qiu Dongyue quickly ran to the left, trying to deceive Liang Henlu to divert his attention.
1:36:57|1:37:8|When Liang Henlu initiated an attack and lifted his long knife, Qiu Dongyue feigned a move to the right to deceive Liang Henlu, causing him to swing to the right. Immediately after, Qiu Dongyue turned around and the tip of the spear narrowly hit the back of Liang Henlu's head.
1:37:9|1:37:21|Liang Henlu hesitated to attack easily after this move. He placed the knife diagonally in front of him, the tip of the knife aimed at Qiu Dongyue's throat, carefully maneuvering around him.
1:37:21|1:37:29|Seeing Liang Henlu being so conservative, [Qiu Dongyue] changed his role and took the initiative to attack. He first made a feint and then immediately shifted sideways.
1:37:30|1:37:34|He continuously shifts sideways, shortening the distance for attacks between [Qiu Dongyue] and [Liang Henlu].
1:37:34|1:37:40|When Liang Henlu discovered Qiu Dongyue's tricks, he immediately switched his long knife to a short knife.
1:37:40|1:37:45|The two engaged in a back-and-forth, testing each other's reaction speed and attack distance.
1:37:45|1:37:48|After several rounds, both of them were unable to find each other's weaknesses.
1:37:50|1:37:54|During the martial arts competition, most of the time they were exchanging moves from a distance.
1:37:54|1:37:59|Qiu Dongyue's footwork is flexible and varied, and her body sways from side to side.
1:37:59|1:38:5|Facing the unpredictable footwork of [Qiu Dongyue], Liang Henlu kept his nerves taut, not daring to relax in the slightest.
1:38:5|1:38:7|In a round, [Qiu Dongyue] continuously probes forward.
1:38:8|1:38:16|Liang Henlu quickly shortened the long knife into a short knife, almost swiping towards [Qiu Dongyue], but was dodged by [Qiu Dongyue] who quickly moved backwards.
1:38:16|1:38:29|After the distance was opened, Liang Henlu switched from a short knife to a long knife. Qie Lang and Zuo Pian Shi on the side were sweating for them, and their bodies involuntarily moved with their footsteps. The three sect leaders at the door were also the same in the observation of the battle.
1:38:31|1:38:39|After testing each other out, Qiu Dongyue and Liang Henlu arrived at the high platform under the roof beam, intending to stop the chit-chat and determine the winner with one move.
1:38:39|1:38:47|Before the final battle, Qiu Dongyue and Liang Henlu made their last preparations. Liang Henlu used the belt around his waist to generate a shaking force, producing a sharp sound of two or three swishing knives.
1:38:54|1:39:5|It can be seen that Liang Henlu's skills are very profound, as he is able to quickly transfer his own strength to the blade, swiftly balancing the enemy's situation.
1:39:5|1:39:14|But on the side, [Qiu Dongyue] made no preparatory movements. He effortlessly exerted force, causing his whole body to shake with force, his movements flowing naturally.
1:39:14|1:39:19|The dual pistols also made a swooshing sound as he exerted force.
1:39:19|1:39:23|After the two of them were ready, they stood facing each other, and the formal competition began.
1:40:5|1:40:9|Unexpectedly, [Qiu Dongyue] stopped Liang Henlu with his long knife.
1:40:27|1:40:35|At the door, the three sect leaders echoed in agreement, Liang Henlu turned his head and looked at Qiu Dongyue in disbelief.
1:40:51|1:40:56|Liang Henlu looked towards Qiu Dongyue not far away, and Qiu Dongyue nodded firmly at him.
1:41:4|1:41:13|[Qiu Dongyue] threw the knife towards [Liang Henlu], but [Liang Henlu] reacted quickly, sheathed the long knife back into its scabbard, and then turned and walked towards the door.
1:41:13|1:41:21|Turning back just before leaving the door, he stopped and looked back at [Qiu Dongyue].
1:41:31|1:41:40|Madam Qiu approached the window, not answering her words, just looking vacantly into the distance.
1:41:40|1:41:46|Ignoring her, [Qiu Dongyue] walked alone to another window and looked in a different direction.
1:41:46|1:41:51|The two stand on the same side, separated by a window in the middle.
1:41:51|1:41:55|On the bank of the Qinhuai River, three exotic women were chatting and laughing on the boat.
1:42:3|1:42:12|Suddenly, the pirate leader Liu Kai, along with his four soldiers, entered their sight, as they were conducting routine patrols along the shore.
1:42:35|1:42:55|Upon hearing this, Liu Kai immediately looked towards the direction of the boat. He saw three foreign women walking towards the boat. He quickly pushed aside the soldiers in front of him and rushed towards the boat. The three foreign women pushed out a set of iron armor from the boat, which Liu Kai carefully examined.
1:42:55|1:43:1|While Liu Kai was playing, three exotic women surrounded him, with one woman even pressing closely against his back.
1:43:5|1:43:24|In the performance, a soldier inquires about Qiu Dongyue's whereabouts. After receiving a response, he quickly runs onto the ship and forcefully removes the foreign woman from Qiu Dongyue's back.
1:43:24|1:43:32|Hearing about the martial arts competition among the four major sects without being informed, [Liu Kai] disregarded his iron armor and turned to run towards [Wu Yi] with the soldiers.
1:43:34|1:43:56|They were unaware that [Liang Henlu] had already left, the unintentional martial arts competition had also ended, and [Qiu Dongyue] was preparing to leave the manor with his guns and baggage.
1:43:56|1:44:22|Madam Qiu, holding the spot where she was hit by Liang Henlu, was seen by Qiu Dongyue, who simply asked a question. Madam Qiu released Liang Henlu's hand and walked to Qiu Dongyue's side before stopping. Qiu Dongyue followed him as they walked towards the mansion, with Qiu Dongyue eventually overtaking Madam Qiu along the way.
1:44:42|1:44:50|After a few brief words, [Madam Qiu] turned around. [Qiu Dongyue] walked up to stand beside him.
1:44:50|1:44:56|After a moment, Qiu Dongyue and Liang Henlu walked forward side by side, neither surpassing the other.
1:45:8|1:45:27|Standing in front of the gate, the two of them stopped. [Qiu Dongyue] reached out his hand to Madam Qiu, who took the money pouch from her waist that Qiu Dongyue had given her earlier. After a brief exchange, they parted ways.
1:45:27|1:45:33|Qiu Dongyue showed no intention of continuing the fight, Madam Qiu lowered her hands. Qiu Dongyue stepped over the threshold and stood still.
1:45:36|1:45:49|He reached into the pocket at the cuff, took out a beard pouch, shook it flat, tidied the beard on his chin, and put it into the pouch.
1:45:49|1:45:54|At the moment of preparing to tie the rope, he thought of the changes below the cliff.
1:45:54|1:46:2|[Qiu Dongyue] sat on the stone steps in front of the thatched cottage, holding a crying baby in his arms. He gently patted the baby's back, trying to make him stop crying.
1:46:5|1:46:11|Madam Qiu watched Qiu Dongyue, who had stopped in front of her, not understanding what he was thinking.
1:46:11|1:46:22|Qiu Dongyue pondered for a moment, then re-dressed his bag. His current attire was the same as when he left the mountains and entered the city, carrying dual guns and wearing a bamboo hat.
1:46:22|1:46:31|Everything seemed unchanged, yet something seemed different. He walked away with his head held high, leaving the concubine's residence and the commercial city behind.
1:46:38|1:46:46|The old concubine stood inside the triple gate, unable to step out, watching as [Qiu Dongyue] left.
1:46:46|1:46:50|After leaving the concubine's residence, Liang Henlu and Qiu Dongyue found a woman from the Sai Lan tribe.
1:46:50|1:46:54|She rode a fast horse, embracing a woman in front of her.
1:46:54|1:47:1|But at this moment, in her heart, she remembered the encounter with [Madam Qiu] in the concubine's residence.
1:47:10|1:47:19|Madam Qiu stood alone by the window of her attic, staring blankly at the distant street.
1:47:30|1:47:39|Sailan didn't respond, just followed her own chosen destiny, lying happily in Liang Henlu's arms, the evening sun shining on her face.
