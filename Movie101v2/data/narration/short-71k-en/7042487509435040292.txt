0:3:2|0:3:9|He quickly picked up the walkie-talkie hanging by his ear and gave instructions. The five vehicles split into three groups and set out to search for the ancient city of Li Jian.
0:3:9|0:3:18|Soon, four vehicles continued to move forward against the biting wind and snow, while [Huo An] and [Lu Kuisi] chose to trek over the mountains on foot.
0:3:18|0:3:29|After helping each other climb over one mountain after another, they were greeted by a scene of ruins and debris. Under the heavy snow,
0:3:29|0:3:37|The site appears to be the ruins of a village, with the originally planned orderly houses now reduced to only beams standing in place.
0:3:37|0:3:47|The two of them immediately smiled at each other upon seeing this, and continued to explore forward. Soon they discovered several arches belonging to the Roman style not far away.
0:3:47|0:3:52|It seems that the military manual of Huo An is real, and Liangcheng is not just a legend.
0:3:52|0:3:59|Therefore, they quickened their pace and swiftly crossed the nearly cloud-piercing arch, stopping in front of a staircase.
0:3:59|0:4:7|[Huo An] bent down and swept away the thick snow, revealing the two characters "Li Jian" carved on the bronze immediately.
0:4:8|0:4:18|[Lu Kuisi] joyfully shouted, then used both hands to vigorously sweep away the snow, finally, the bronze inscription was fully revealed at this moment.
0:4:19|0:4:24|Even after years of wind and frost, one can still see the majestic and noble appearance of [Huo An].
0:4:27|0:4:34|At this moment, [Chris] set aside his portable computer and instructed [Carina] to take out the scanner, inserting it into the snow to use satellite technology to reconstruct the former glory of the Li Jian Ancient City.
0:5:21|0:5:30|Just as the two were amazed, suddenly, a slightly stone statue reappeared at the top of the towering pillar in front of them.
0:5:32|0:5:41|Upon closer inspection, the figure was wearing a helmet with a sharp ridge, carrying a set of iron leaf armor on the shoulders, with a gold-trimmed collar fluttering, and a chest protector hanging in the front and back.
0:5:41|0:5:45|The wing of a stone eagle is connected to its back.
0:5:46|0:5:56|Under the cold winter, the snow clinging to the stone statues shines in the cold Sun Palace, and one can faintly hear the roar of a tiger.
0:5:59|0:6:5|Sitting steadily in the center of the ancient city, overlooking all beings, this armor must belong to the war god [Huo An].
0:6:5|0:6:11|So [Huo An] and [Lu Kuisi] quickly used the satellite to scan it carefully.
0:6:11|0:6:18|With this armor, the movie "Dragon Blade" we are going to talk about today officially begins.
0:6:20|0:6:29|The story goes back to 48 BC on the border of the Great Han Silk Road, where thirty-six ethnic groups had to kill each other in order to survive.
0:6:31|0:6:40|As the Grand Commander of the Western Regions Protectorate, [Huo An] takes it upon himself to maintain peace in the Western Regions. Upon hearing about the unrest at the border, he quickly leads his troops to the scene.
0:6:42|0:6:59|With his hair tied behind his head and a beard braided, clad in the robe of the Protectorate, Huo An spotted two groups of men and horses, one black and one white, ready to charge in the valley below as soon as he reached the mountain top. Hurriedly, he signaled to his men beside him.
0:7:6|0:7:14|Another subordinate of Huo An heard about it, took out a heavy book, observed the clothing and weapons of both sides in the valley, and compared them with the patterns in the book.
0:7:48|0:7:53|As soon as the words fell, one of Huo An's subordinates, wielding a long-handled wolf-toothed club, led a charge on horseback.
0:7:54|0:8:6|Before getting close, [Hong Ri] by the side of Iron Evil Khan immediately released the fierce eagle. After it pecked the eye of the warhorse, he rode closer and knocked the opponent down with one palm.
0:8:6|0:8:13|Seeing the excited [Hong Ri] already dismounted, [Huo An] quickly led his men to charge straight down from the top of the mountain.
0:8:14|0:8:22|In the scorching desert, [Hong Ri] swiftly circled behind the opponent, lifting him over his head multiple times before forcefully slamming him into the sand.
0:8:31|0:8:42|Upon hearing the opponent's insults, [Leng Yue] was instantly ignited with anger. With a swift step and a whip of her right hand, she charged out and fiercely lashed the opponent's back.
0:8:45|0:8:50|Watching as [Leng Yue] swung her leg down from above, landing a heavy blow with a diagonal hook to the chin of one of Bai Rong's men.
0:8:50|0:8:56|[Huo An] quickly put on a small shield on his left arm and arrived beside the soldiers of the White Feather tribe, successfully blocking a fatal blow from [Leng Yue].
0:9:6|0:9:12|On the other side, Huo An revealed his identity as the commander of the Western Regions Protectorate. Seeing him bowing sincerely and respectfully, Chief Lu Kuisi gestured for his tribesmen to remain calm.
0:9:45|0:9:47|[Huo An] listened and glanced at the Bai Rong people beside him.
0:9:47|0:9:55|First, he used a small shield to block the falling rocks, then grabbed the oncoming long whip.
0:10:10|0:10:20|Agilely dodging several attacks, [Huo An] seized the opportunity to grab the long whip, firmly stepping on the foot of [Leng Yue] who was attacking, directly immobilizing her in front of him.
0:10:20|0:10:28|At this moment, [Leng Yue] suddenly exerted force forward, and when [Huo An] fell to the ground, her hands were straight and stuck on the opponent's chest, directly placing her horizontally above herself.
0:10:30|0:10:38|[Huo An], who was slapped in the face, explained.
0:10:46|0:10:55|After saying that, [Huo An] smiled and casually threw the long sword hanging behind him. Realizing the man underestimated her, [Leng Yue] raised her twin knives and charged forward.
0:10:55|0:11:22|With a swift turn, the dagger pierced straight into the armor on [Huo An]'s chest. Then, seizing the advantage, she pursued, her fingers dancing as she swung the curved blade towards [Huo An]'s neck. As he leaned back to avoid it, [Leng Yue] stepped forward, planting herself between [Huo An]'s feet. With a forceful twist of her ankle, she swung her body forward in succession, narrowly missing his head with the blade tip, only to find [Huo An] had already escaped.
0:11:24|0:11:28|[Leng Yue] frowned, the curved blade in her left hand flew out of her wrist and stabbed straight into the ground beside [Huo An].
0:11:29|0:11:40|Before [Huo An] could bend down to pull out the weapon, [Leng Yue] swiftly approached like a thunderbolt and sent him flying straight up. Then, bending down to retrieve the curved blade, she executed a scorpion tail strike directly towards [Huo An]'s face.
0:11:40|0:11:46|Unexpectedly, his ankle was protected by [Leng Yue]. So she twisted her body and propped her hands on the sandy ground.
0:11:46|0:11:52|The other leg exerted force, and the curved hook on the sole instantly cut [Huo An]'s forearm, breaking free from the restraints.
0:11:52|0:12:6|Forced by circumstances, [Huo An] no longer dodged, clamping the curved blade brought by [Leng Yue] under his armpit, and then seizing her in front of him. Unexpectedly, when [Leng Yue] struggled and shook her head, she accidentally had her veil torn off by [Huo An].
0:12:6|0:12:10|The people present fell silent at the sight.
0:12:14|0:12:22|Chieftain Tie Xie awkwardly turned his head, while [Hong Ri] glared at [Huo An] with wide eyes, and [Huo An] looked down at the veil in his hand, at a loss.
0:12:22|0:12:32|On the way back to the city, [Huo An] could only face the ridicule of his brothers.
0:12:43|0:12:56|In the palace of the country of Huo An, [Huo An] took the wine glass boldly under the daring gaze of [Leng Yue]. Before [Huo An] could finish drinking, [Leng Yue] unexpectedly stripped naked in front of him, causing him to spit out the wine in his mouth in shock.
0:13:14|0:13:22|Sitting on the horse, [Huo An] laughed and playfully patted the chest of his subordinate [Mountain Leopard], then tightened the saddle and rode straight towards home on his warhorse.
0:13:22|0:13:26|Finally, before the sunset, the group wrapped in sand and wind returned to the town.
0:14:9|0:14:16|[Huo An], who entered the room carrying a wooden lunch box, looked up and saw the lyrics written by [Xiu Qing], and couldn't help but sing along.
0:14:46|0:14:56|At this moment, [Huo An] stood in front of the desk dictating while instructing [Xiu Qing] to take notes for the memorial to be presented to the Grand Commandant.
0:15:0|0:15:16|[Huo An] awkwardly tightened his hands crossed in front of his chest, then walked to the side, poured a bowl of wine, and drank it down in big gulps. [Xiu Qing] then patted his shoulder and said.
0:15:32|0:15:39|Looking down at the resolute [Xiu Qing], [Huo An] had just raised his arms to embrace her when suddenly they heard a knocking at the door.
0:15:39|0:15:44|Upon opening the door, [Yin Po], with his hair combed back, appeared with a serious expression on his face.
0:15:53|0:15:59|Surrounding the heavy boxes filled with gold coins were several bodies lying dead in a row.
0:16:8|0:16:14|Upon hearing this, [Huo An] widened his eyes, put on his outer robe, picked up his sword, and then rushed out the door.
0:16:15|0:16:26|Looking at the soldiers outside the Protectorate, he quickly stepped into the hall, where [Huo An]'s subordinates, with their hands and feet bound, shouted anxiously.
0:16:37|0:16:45|The contemptuous attitude of Captain immediately prompted [Yin Po] to draw his sword.
0:16:45|0:16:50|[Huo An] grabbed his forearm and said in a low voice.
0:17:1|0:17:11|The centurion presented the prefect's token, and with a few words, announced the future of [Huo An] and his men.
0:17:11|0:17:17|Before dawn, the group was already being escorted onto a prisoner carriage, heading towards Yanmen Pass.
0:17:17|0:17:25|Until dusk, the prisoner wagon continued to roam in the desolate mountains and deserts.
0:18:18|0:18:29|[Huo An], after calming the emotions of his brothers, sat in the prisoner car and firmly assured them. As dusk fell, the prisoner car arrived in front of a dilapidated city wall that was ten stories high.
0:18:31|0:18:39|Through the cracks of the prisoner car, one can vaguely see some of the slaves repairing the arrow tower with sand, wood, and stones.
0:18:42|0:18:50|[Huo An] and his group, following the team that had also been enslaved, slowly walked through the city gate after removing their handcuffs and leg irons.
0:18:50|0:18:56|Looking around, prisoners from various tribes are pulling hemp ropes, methodically moving earth and stones.
0:18:57|0:19:3|In front of the only intact pointed gate, [Huo An] and his group stopped in their tracks.
0:19:4|0:19:11|The armor and spirit tablet of Huo Qubing were originally seated on the stone platform, overlooking the front.
0:19:16|0:19:22|Looking at the old armor and spirit tablets in front of him, [Huo An] recalled the scene of his first meeting with the general.
0:19:24|0:19:32|At that time, Huo Qubing led his troops to gallop along the border. After the infuriated Kuchan people retreated repeatedly in defeat, they actually kidnapped Han children.
0:19:32|0:19:38|After the two armies met, the prisoner carriage was opened in front of him, enjoying the pleasure of hunting down the Han people.
0:19:40|0:19:43|Although the battle was over, [Huo Qubing] shed tears as he looked at the bodies of the elderly, weak, and sick.
0:19:50|0:19:57|At this moment, [Huo An], who had lost his sister, took advantage of [Huo Qubing]'s unpreparedness, snatched the short blade from his waist, and stabbed it into [Huo Qubing]'s side.
0:19:58|0:20:6|With a loud shout, Huo Qubing stepped back, kneeling in front of [Huo An], one hand covering his abdomen and the other on Huo An's shoulder, murmuring.
0:20:18|0:20:23|And then, [Huo An] took it upon himself to help others, striving to maintain peace on the border.
0:20:24|0:20:31|Looking at the tablet of their benefactor, a group of brothers followed [Huo An], placing one hand over their chest and bowing reverently.
0:20:37|0:20:40|On the other side, the Wusun people stood on a high point, using roller-skate devices to direct the Nandi people on the ground to pull back, allowing the stones to smoothly ascend.
0:20:42|0:20:49|Unexpectedly, the long wooden support on the ground suddenly broke, and the stones fell directly onto the wooden frame, causing the Wusun man to fall from a height to the ground.
0:20:51|0:20:58|Huo An, who rushed over in a hurry to save someone, was unexpectedly hit by a falling plank.
0:21:12|0:21:21|Seeing the Turks pushing the Nan Di people to the ground and viciously kicking them, Huo An quickly grabbed the opponent's headscarf and pressed it firmly onto the wooden cart.
0:21:39|0:21:44|[Huo An], who hurriedly stepped onto the steps, was just about to declare his identity to the Southern Di people when a horizontally swinging iron hammer struck towards him.
0:21:46|0:21:53|And at the foot of the city wall, several Southern Di people joined forces to push down the piled-up logs, causing each one to arch towards the Tujue people.
0:21:54|0:22:2|But [Huo An] had no time to deal with the distant farce, so he had to first separate the fierce fight between the Tujue and Wusun people in front of him.
0:22:2|0:22:11|Unfortunately, neither side was willing to stop first. In desperation, [Huo An] had to strike with his left palm at the throat of one, while his right fist hammered heavily on the shoulder of the other.
0:22:11|0:22:20|Seeing people from various tribes joining the fight, [Huo An] hurriedly tried to mediate in Turkic. At this moment, the soldiers on the city tower sounded the bronze gong.
0:22:33|0:22:42|After the troublemakers were scolded and taken away by the soldiers, [Huo An] and his group were brought before the captain [Yan Tou] and the army doctor [Lao Shu] at Yanmen Pass.
0:23:19|0:23:22|As soon as the words fell, [Lao Shu] handed over a precious sword.
0:23:39|0:23:45|Seeing [Yan Tou] in front of him, clad in heavy armor and trying to look fierce, [Huo An] led the others to turn and leave.
0:23:47|0:23:53|The city, which was originally filled with dust from the fighting, has now been restored to its original state, and prisoners from various tribes are diligently repairing the city walls.
0:23:54|0:24:5|The next day at noon, a group of soldiers wearing red phosphorus helmets, metal plate armor, wielding short sharp swords, and bronze greaves on their legs, rode swiftly on warhorses.
0:24:5|0:24:14|The leading man had a pair of Tibetan mastiffs on his shoulders, black feathers on his helmet, and armor on his horse's face, all indicating his special identity.
0:24:14|0:24:20|This is the Roman's top warrior [Lu Kuisi], followed by a group of cavalry, who are his brave and skilled warriors.
0:24:28|0:24:48|Upon hearing the deputy Charles's request for instructions, Huo An first inquired about the current situation of the army. Learning that there were less than eight hundred soldiers, and less than three thousand crossbows, and that the army was lacking in water and strength, he couldn't help but turn around and look towards the only carriage in the formation.
0:24:48|0:24:51|He then dismounted and walked quickly to the carriage.
0:24:51|0:24:56|As the attendant Hua Gao opened the car door, [Lu Kuisi] quickly bent down.
0:24:56|0:25:5|Prince Pris, dressed in royal attire and wearing a crown on his head, slowly opens his eyes upon hearing the sound, reaching forward with his hands.
0:25:27|0:25:29|Therefore, the city can be captured without much delay.
0:25:29|0:25:36|Continuing, after receiving the water pouch from the flower expert, [Huo An] quickly brought it to the little prince's lips, carefully serving him to drink it in small sips.
0:25:38|0:25:43|Then he heard the other side say that he was waiting for the good news of his victory on the carriage.
0:25:45|0:25:52|Lu Kuisi, who wanted to quickly resolve the battle, arrived at the city under the wind and sand.
0:25:53|0:25:59|Upon seeing the foreign troops attacking from outside the city, the soldiers hurriedly beat the drums, and [Huo An] and his group quickly ran towards the city wall.
0:26:1|0:26:11|The soldiers guarding the city were already holding bows and arrows, hiding behind the sword helm, waiting only for the command.
0:26:21|0:26:30|Ignoring the obstruction of [Huo An], the defending soldiers in the city shot arrows in unison. [Lu Kuisi]'s warhorse looked at the arrows sinking into the desert in front of its hooves, immediately halting its steps.
0:26:30|0:26:36|Next, [Lu Kuisi] unexpectedly turned around and roared to retreat.
0:26:50|0:27:4|[Yan Tou] lifted the hands of [Huo An] holding onto his own arms, then ordered to open the city gates wide and led over a hundred elite soldiers to chase after [Lu Kuisi] in the direction he fled. In no time, the two groups of troops had already run five miles away.
0:27:4|0:27:10|Under the scorching sun, the sound of hooves kicking up sand filled the air, and waves of heat rose from the desert.
0:27:11|0:27:17|Single-mindedly pursuing the enemy, [Yan Tou] naturally failed to notice the ambush trap not far ahead in the sandy ground.
0:27:18|0:27:29|At this moment, [Lu Kuisi] suddenly turned around and smiled, leading his legion to gallop past. A hemp rope shot up from the sand, and [Yan Tou], who couldn't stop in time, was directly whipped off his horse by the rope.
0:27:29|0:27:45|A plan succeeded, and immediately two groups of Roman soldiers emerged from the sand. Two tightly stretched hemp ropes instantly pulled [Yan Tou]'s subordinates off their horses. Despite the choking sand dust, everyone intended to abandon their horses and flee, not knowing when the legion with long shields and short swords would turn back here.
0:28:0|0:28:4|[Huo An] ignored [Lao Shu]'s words and then turned and walked down the city tower.
0:28:6|0:28:16|At this moment, Sima led a group of soldiers to sneak under the arrow tower, while [Lao Shu] and [Mountain Leopard] directed everyone to raise the military flags and quickly rush to each arrow helm.
0:28:17|0:28:27|Just as [Lu Kuisi] was giving the order and shouting for the legion to break into the city, smoke signals were lit on the city walls, signaling the guards' declaration.
0:28:27|0:28:33|The soldiers who were originally crouching behind the arrow rudder quickly and orderly raised the military flags.
0:28:33|0:28:39|Amidst the thunder, military flags emerged from every battlement like spring rain, pouring out from each crenelation on the city wall.
0:28:39|0:28:48|[Lu Kuisi] turned around in confusion and looked at his deputy Charles. When he turned back, the archers on the opposite arrow tower were already poised to shoot.
0:28:55|0:28:59|Seeing the legion stop advancing, [Lao Shu] cheered with joy.
0:28:59|0:29:3|Next, [Huo An] led his brothers from the Protectorate out of the city to meet the enemy in battle.
0:29:3|0:29:8|Upon closer inspection, he was actually wearing the same Cloud Armor worn by General Huo Yuanjia.
0:29:9|0:29:16|Sitting on the horse with a sword by his side, [Huo An] looks majestic and imposing.
0:29:16|0:29:20|Seeing the sudden appearance of a stranger, [Lu Kuisi] urged his horse forward.
0:29:20|0:29:25|Seeing the other side suddenly dismount, he also walked casually towards [Huo An].
0:29:25|0:29:32|In the swirling yellow sand, [Lu Kuisi] stood ten steps away, brandishing his short sword to declare his identity.
0:29:54|0:29:56|[Huo An] refused to agree to the other party's unreasonable request.
0:29:56|0:30:19|Therefore, [Lu Kuisi] raised his head to signal that one of them must fight. Seeing him draw his short sword, [Huo An] also threw out his flying claws. He passed the sword hilt and then with a strong swing, tossed the scabbard to Lao Hu. The long sword sparkled with cold light under the sunlight as [Lu Kuisi] took the initiative, wielding his short sword to strike directly at [Huo An]'s face and back.
0:30:19|0:30:25|Then, Chen Jian knocked him out and took advantage of his unpreparedness, striking a sword straight at the top of [Huo An]'s head.
0:30:25|0:30:30|Fortunately, [Huo An]'s helmet remained secure, with only a thin layer of copper shaved off between the light swords.
0:30:30|0:30:43|When retreating, slightly shorter [Lu Kuisi] bumped into the helmet of [Huo An] unintentionally. The two took a step back each. At this moment, [Huo An] adjusted his armor and unexpectedly caught sight of a Roman soldier falling straight off his horse.
0:30:48|0:30:52|Before anyone could speak, [Lu Kuisi] had already rushed forward to attack.
0:30:52|0:30:58|[Huo An] blocked the hand chop, then hung the long sword and stabbed towards [Lu Kuisi] around the left arm guard.
0:30:58|0:31:2|The blade cuts straight into the armor on the opponent's side.
0:31:14|0:31:20|[Lu Kuisi] is like a sword god today, his opponent seems too clumsy, winning is very difficult.
0:31:20|0:31:27|The Little Prince grinned, revealing his cracked lips. At that moment, [Lu Kuisi] grabbed [Huo An]'s right wrist with one hand.
0:31:27|0:31:47|Another hand raised the sword towards the top again, intending to finish him off while he was down. Unexpectedly, [Huo An] rolled in place, swung his right wrist, and after the long sword was thrown into the air, it was pulled back into his hand, allowing him to charge straight towards [Lu Kuisi]'s face without moving forward. Then, [Huo An] grabbed [Lu Kuisi]'s wrist and kicked hard, knocking him to the ground.
0:31:47|0:32:1|[Yan Tou], with his hands tied behind his back, knelt on the ground and roared defiantly, while [Lu Kuisi] got back up, weighed the short sword in his hand, and gestured for [Huo An] to continue.
0:32:1|0:32:8|At this moment, [Huo An] roars loudly. The overwhelming sand extends and grows larger.
0:32:16|0:32:25|Just now, [Huo An] was leisurely eating pastries, but then quickly turned to look at the raging sandstorm that was destroying everything, and hurriedly leaned into the carriage to check on the condition of the young prince.
0:32:25|0:32:33|[Lu Kuisi], seeing the situation turning unfavorable, once again swung his short sword towards [Huo An], then used both hands to hold the long sword in front of him.
0:32:34|0:32:39|Unexpectedly, [Huo An] flicked his wrist and both of them placed their swords horizontally at each other's necks.
0:32:40|0:32:45|At this moment, Huo An rushed to the front of the formation, holding the unconscious Little Prince in sorrow and anger.
0:32:45|0:32:51|[Huo An] pushed upwards with all his strength, causing the two to quickly retreat.
0:33:7|0:33:15|Otherwise, if we keep fighting, everyone will be buried alive by the sandstorm, including the Little Prince. [Lu Kuisi] gasped as he looked across at [Huo An].
0:33:15|0:33:21|Next, he was seen pulling the flying claws off the hilt of the sword and plunging the sword straight into the sand in front of him.
0:33:23|0:33:31|So [Lu Kuisi] lowered the tip of his sword and walked straight towards [Huo An]. Standing in front of the long sword, he swallowed hard, thought for a moment, and then spoke.
0:33:31|0:33:39|The army now needs food and water, while the Little Prince needs medicine.
0:33:41|0:33:48|Then he loosened his grip, and the short sword fell with a clatter. After a moment of contemplation, he added that he also needed to find a place to think things through.
0:33:48|0:33:56|The deal is done. As night falls, after the sandstorm, the area outside Yan Tou Pass is in a mess.
0:33:57|0:34:4|In the city, under the large stone pillar, surrounded by swirling smoke and fire, Roman soldiers were lying on the steps in a disheveled manner.
0:34:4|0:34:10|Although their tired and hungry bodies found some comfort, each soldier did not sleep soundly.
0:34:10|0:34:18|With their dirty faces, even in their dreams, they would still clasp their hands over their chests, praying that the little prince inside the house was unharmed.
0:34:18|0:34:29|In the brightly lit room, [Lao Shu] picked up a long needle from the medicine box and approached the bed. He lifted the hem of the little prince's royal robe and forcefully pierced it below the navel.
0:34:29|0:34:43|[Lu Kuisi], [Huo An], and [Yan Tou] were anxiously waiting by the bedside, as [Lao Shu] slowly removed the needle. The young prince suddenly woke up, shouting [Lu Kuisi]'s name.
0:34:48|0:34:55|After touching the outstretched hands of [Lu Kuisi], he anxiously asked, "In the duel between the Chinese warriors and the Roman legion, the winner is the Roman legion, right?"
0:35:16|0:35:24|[Huo An] listened and then smirked.
0:35:32|0:35:47|Yan Tou, who doesn't understand English, was deceived by Huo An and repeated the words fiercely before throwing off his robe and walking outside. When the little prince fell asleep again, Lu Kuisi alone set foot on a broken city wall.
0:35:48|0:35:56|The moon was bright, with only wooden frames and scattered rocks used for repairing the city walls around.
0:35:56|0:36:7|This is undoubtedly a perfect place for contemplation. He then recalled the scene when he was in a beautifully decorated palace.
0:36:7|0:36:14|The man, wearing heavy armor and a stubbly beard, walked slowly, not carrying a sword but holding a small vial of night light.
0:36:14|0:36:32|The little prince lying on the bed saw the visitor and instantly showed a sweet smile. Then the man dripped the medicine from the small bottle into the bowl. After the little prince, who was still smiling, drank it, he experienced excruciating pain.
0:36:34|0:36:42|In the chaos, [Lu Kuisi] fought his way out, handed the young prince to Huagao, and led a group of soldiers to hold off the enemy.
0:36:43|0:36:50|At this moment, a strange noise came from behind [Lu Kuisi], and when he turned around, it was [Huo An].
0:36:55|0:37:2|Next, picking up the wine pot placed on the city wall, [Huo An] first filled up [Lu Kuisi]'s cup, then lifted another bowl filled with strong liquor.
0:37:9|0:37:14|Although the stimulation behind his head made his facial features frown, [Huo An] signaled to [Lu Kuisi] again.
0:37:33|0:37:39|He would be at a loss and even find that there was no way to go. He asked curiously.
0:37:55|0:38:1|[Lu Kuisi] sneered at this, saying that in today's world, peace is nothing but a dream.
0:38:5|0:38:11|Huo An then drew [Huo An]'s long sword and examined it carefully, expressing that he had no intention of hostility, just curiosity.
0:39:26|0:39:34|[Lu Kuisi] quickly stepped back upon seeing the situation, exclaiming why this person always looks so worried.
0:40:1|0:40:5|[Huo An] immediately rushed to translate for [Lu Kuisi], "Yan Tou believes in you." At this moment, [Lu Kuisi] proposed a condition for exchange.
0:40:5|0:40:12|If Huo An wants to repair the city wall within 15 days, he must find someone to take his deputy to the country of Anxi.
0:40:15|0:40:22|Once both sides reached an agreement, [Lao Shu] spread out a map on the table.
0:40:26|0:40:35|In the western region of China, the Kingdom of Anxi is located to the northwest of Yan Tou Pass on the map. Afterwards, Huo An ordered Mountain Leopard to bring his deputy and a group of six people galloped away on horseback.
0:40:36|0:40:40|The repairing of the Great Wall then began.
0:40:48|0:40:57|Inside the military tent, Roman soldiers orderly moved all the documents on the wooden table aside, then brought various measuring tools and drawing instruments.
0:40:57|0:41:13|Later, [Lu Kuisi] led a group of Roman soldiers to the foot of the crumbling city wall. Two soldiers stood on top of the high wall, one with a crossbow shooting short arrows with long ropes attached across to the other side. The other soldier marked the length of the rope and reported it to [Lu Kuisi].
0:41:13|0:41:17|He then took out parchment and drew the appearance of the city wall, recording it in a book.
0:41:17|0:41:25|The width of the broken section of the city wall is recorded, and soldiers take out a long rope with iron blocks hanging on it, hanging it vertically against the city wall to measure the height.
0:41:25|0:41:31|Looking at the busy Roman soldiers measuring, [Lao Shu] said.
0:41:32|0:41:40|The width of the broken section of the city wall is recorded, and soldiers take out a long rope with iron blocks hanging on it, hanging it vertically against the city wall to measure the exact height.
0:41:44|0:42:0|Seeing [Huo An] commanding the crowd, using a round stick to transport stones by placing them on the ground, a Roman soldier stepped forward to demonstrate a simple method. He placed the backs of two curved long shields facing upwards on the ground to support the stones, and with just three people pushing from behind, they were able to smoothly transport them away.
0:42:3|0:42:12|Following that, a group of soldiers in the city obeyed the orders of [Lu Kuisi], pulling out long wooden poles and carrying them to an open space. They saw someone collapsing due to exhaustion on the ground, and many Tujue people mocked and made fun of them.
0:42:15|0:42:26|A minor interruption did not affect the progress of the project. After everyone turned the long wood into long strips, the Roman soldiers pieced them together into a hollow rectangular prism.
0:42:26|0:42:39|Another group of soldiers took off their shirts and exercised iron bars by the furnace. After finishing, they overlapped them in a cross shape, nailed them with iron nails, and then filled the cast iron cage with broken stones.
0:42:44|0:42:56|[Huo An] and others then built several transmission devices with gears according to [Lu Kuisi]'s drawings. The largest gear is about three meters high.
0:42:56|0:43:26|Standing upright in the center of the device, connected to it is a half-height small gear, the only horizontal gear, also nickel-plated with it. Under the push of a group of Roman soldiers, the three gears interact with each other, driving another set of long hooks on the transmission device, which the person above uses to hang the iron chain on the iron cage on the city wall. With the collective effort of the people, the device hoists the long cage to the damaged part of the city wall.
0:43:55|0:44:1|Wanting to touch the city wall, at the request of the Little Prince, [Lu Kuisi] placed his hands on the arrow rudder in front of him.
0:44:4|0:44:11|The little prince then carefully pressed his ear against it. Suddenly, he shouted out loud.
0:44:12|0:44:14|I seemed to see myself, even saw myself in the city of Rome.
0:44:29|0:44:35|Occasionally, what came into their ears was the music played on the harp by their mother specifically for the two of them.
0:44:36|0:44:39|[Lu Kuisi] gradually lost focus as he listened to the little prince's memories.
0:44:41|0:44:50|The interruption of "Do you miss him?" broke [Lu Kuisi]'s train of thought. Although silent, the memory of those delicate vermilion lips and deep eyes once again plunged him into contemplation.
0:44:52|0:45:0|A light breeze blew by, and the two of them rested their chins on the arrow rudder in silence for a long time.
0:45:0|0:45:11|The next day at noon, while repairing the gaps in the city wall, [Huo An] drank a bowl of wine and called his brothers over.
0:45:12|0:45:22|Seven people took off their outer robes, neatly placed them on the ground, and then lined up in three rows in front of [Huo An]'s armor.
0:45:23|0:45:30|The originally upright body half squats into a horse stance, with both arms sometimes in a bow-pulling posture and sometimes clenched into fists.
0:45:34|0:45:38|The practice of martial arts quickly attracted everyone's attention.
0:45:38|0:45:51|Yan Tou just walked out of the military tent, looked up and saw Huo An and others crouching down with their legs rounded, swinging half a circle in the air, then relying on the strength of one arm, leaping up from the ground.
0:45:51|0:45:57|At this moment, [Lu Kuisi] arrived with his subordinates upon hearing the noise, and after a brief look, he smiled and turned away.
0:45:59|0:46:12|After warming up, [Huo An] took the lead in pulling out his long sword, hooked the flying claws on the sword handle, slashed and stabbed. Before long, a neat drumbeat sounded in the ears.
0:46:12|0:46:33|The Roman soldiers were originally lined up behind the crowd, secretly sizing each other up. When they turned around to look at the Wusun people who were watching the excitement, they brought some of the crowd behind them. With a command, wearing heavy armor and holding sticks in their hands, the two rows of Roman soldiers facing each other quickly smashed towards each other, followed by punches and shoulder strikes.
0:46:33|0:46:42|[Huo An] caught a glimpse of the scene across from him, saw [Lu Kuisi] give him a crooked smile, and then turned to step into the ranks.
0:46:42|0:46:50|The seven men reformed their formation and advanced step by step, first forcefully thrusting their swords straight into the air, then swiftly pulling them back with flying claws.
0:46:50|0:46:58|Then, three of them bent down while the other three stepped on their backs and leaped forward. 
0:46:58|0:47:8|With a stretch and a pull, the sword was once again back in his hand. At this moment, Roman soldiers lined up in five rows and six columns, holding long spears and shields, standing in formation.
0:47:8|0:47:15|With a step and a turn, the original square formation had somehow transformed into the shape of the letter "W".
0:47:16|0:47:19|Huo An gave a thumbs-up at the formation like this.
0:47:30|0:47:47|Sima changed into the robe of the Protectorate, carrying a hoe as he walked to the center of the open space. With a stomp of his foot, he removed the hoe blade, then placed the long stick horizontally in front of his chest, pointing it towards the Roman soldier holding a short stick.
0:47:47|0:47:53|The young man couldn't hold back his impatience and launched the attack first. Unexpectedly, the stick hit right under Huo An's armpit.
0:47:53|0:48:2|Huo An was then blocked by him in front of him and attacked his chest with a long stick. The infuriated Roman soldier immediately used two sticks to smash towards Lu Kuisi.
0:48:2|0:48:9|The arms contracted and expanded, seemingly aiming straight at the opponent's face, but were suddenly pushed back, narrowly avoiding a hit on the nose.
0:48:9|0:48:23|After Sima stood up, he immediately thrust his staff into the soldier's throat, then followed up by striking the soldier's lower leg with another blow, and finally knocking away his short stick in pursuit.
0:48:24|0:48:29|The Nan Di people who had previously bet on the victory of the Protectorate hurriedly walked away when they saw this.
0:48:29|0:48:37|At this point, the competition has entered the second round, with the Roman soldier walking into the center holding a stick in one hand and a shield in the other.
0:48:38|0:48:43|Old [Huo An] saw the situation and tightly gripped the unsheathed long sword in his hand, directly attacking the opponent.
0:48:43|0:48:48|However, every move was blocked by the long shields of the Roman soldiers.
0:48:50|0:48:57|Huo An heard the praise and stayed in place, showing off his Dragon Tail, kicking the Roman soldiers back repeatedly.
0:48:57|0:49:10|Continuing to ride up, a kick landed on the opponent's calf. Thinking to take advantage of the situation, unexpectedly the opponent rolled over and grabbed the collar of old [Huo An], executing a shoulder throw.
0:49:10|0:49:18|The Roman soldiers then placed their long shields in front of their chests and pushed old [Huo An] towards the crowd. Just as old [Huo An] turned around to block with his long sword,
0:49:18|0:49:27|The Roman soldier leaned on his shield, pressing his sword against the ground, forcing the old [Huo An] to let go of his sword and thus lose the match.
0:49:28|0:49:39|Amid the cheers of the crowd, [Huo An] hung his head and walked towards the crowd, but the Roman soldier suddenly stopped him, then raised his long sword to his chest and offered it with both hands.
0:49:40|0:49:44|and expressed great joy at being able to have such a competition.
0:49:44|0:49:52|Old [Huo An] raised his hand to touch his eyebrows, took the opportunity to look back at [Huo An], and saw him gesturing to accept the sword, so he had to reach out and take it.
0:49:52|0:49:58|Upon looking up again, Huo An found the Roman soldier extending his right hand towards him, so [Huo An] smiled and shook hands with him.
0:50:3|0:50:7|The Roman soldier then embraced him from the front and shouted with excitement.
0:50:7|0:50:16|[Huo An] stood in the crowd, with a content smile on his face, and in such an atmosphere, everyone once again immersed themselves in the construction of the Great Wall.
0:50:16|0:50:30|After repairing a section of the city wall, the enthusiastic people pushed the gear mechanism and moved on to the next construction site. In a short period of time, people from thirty-six countries surprisingly established a strong rapport.
0:50:30|0:50:37|Pulling out round logs, crushing stones, sawing long strips, transporting sand and soil, everything is being carried out in an orderly and efficient manner.
0:50:37|0:50:46|Inside the city, there were no longer big fights over minor conflicts. During the break, after everyone had eaten and drunk their fill, they once again threw themselves into the construction work.
0:50:47|0:50:58|Another day passed in the blink of an eye, [Huo An] stood on the city wall facing the glaring sun. Just as he raised his hand to wipe the sweat off his forehead with his sleeve, he turned around to find that something unexpected had happened inside the city.
0:51:13|0:51:20|The group then worked together to prop him up in front of them and quickly gave him water. When he regained consciousness, everyone burst into joyful laughter.
0:51:42|0:51:53|During the break, [Huo An] gathered the representatives of the thirty-six nations inside the military tent and distributed a piece of cloth and a brush to each person.
0:51:54|0:52:1|Huo An grasped the hand of the Little Prince and wrote the name of Rome on the cloth stroke by stroke.
0:52:2|0:52:9|[Huo An] originally wanted to write the three characters for "Little Study", but he forgot the correct strokes and had to ask Sima next to him for help.
0:52:9|0:52:14|The construction is about to reach the deadline set by the Prefect, which is 15 days away.
0:52:14|0:52:36|Under the city wall, the crowd picked up shovels to mix small bricks, rubble, and sand with water, turning them into mortar. The mixture was then put into wooden barrels and lifted to the top of the wall using a gear device with a pulley system. One end was tied to a barrel on the ground, and the other end was fastened to the waist of [Yan Tou] on the platform. By using the weight of their bodies, the mortar was easily transported to the top of the city wall.
0:52:41|0:52:50|As the Roman soldiers used iron nails to connect and fix the various iron cages at the damaged section of the city wall, the Southern Di people slowly applied mortar on top of them.
0:52:50|0:52:58|The setting sun in the west, the original appearance of the city wall finally revealed in front of everyone, the main hall isolated from the sun, standing tall and majestic.
0:53:2|0:53:10|The gate tower and arrow tower are intertwined, standing tall and imposing, with smoke rising gracefully from the city walls in all directions, making it difficult to breach.
0:53:11|0:53:17|Outside the city, on the steep mountains, the military road stretches for hundreds of miles, symbolizing the power over the world.
0:53:18|0:53:24|The crowd's excitement was beyond words, with the Roman soldier taking the lead in embracing Huo An's shoulders and raising his arms high, shouting out loud.
0:53:24|0:53:29|The soldiers of the Han Dynasty were immediately surrounded by the people of the Thirty-Six Nations and rushed towards the city wall.
0:53:29|0:53:35|[Yan Tou] and [Lao Shu] stood outside the crowd, gently touching their chests with one hand and bowing their heads in gratitude to [Lu Kuisi].
0:53:37|0:53:45|[Huo An] was sitting on top of the high wall at some point, he glanced down and saw [Lu Kuisi], waved at him, and the two smiled at each other.
0:53:48|0:53:59|Next, [Huo An] withdrew his gaze and looked into the distance. As night fell, everyone gathered in front of the military tent and set up a grill.
0:54:7|0:54:26|Inside the military tent, [Yan Tou] sat at the main seat. With a wave of his hand, his men lifted the wine jug and carried it out of the tent. [Lu Kuisi] picked up a grape and brought it close to the little prince's ear, asking if he liked music. Just as he finished speaking, [Huo An] wiped the strong liquor from his lips, then strode to the steps in front of the tent, ready to perform a heroic song.
0:55:37|0:55:43|As soon as the heroic song in the desert ended, [Yan Tou] raised his hand to indicate that he also wanted to sing.
0:55:44|0:55:49|So [Huo An] stepped forward and carefully carried him to the wooden platform in front of Huo Qubing's armor.
0:55:49|0:55:55|[Lu Kuisi], Hua Gao, and others who were originally sitting in the tent also stood up with smiles and walked out of the military tent.
0:55:55|0:56:4|Next, [Yan Tou] placed his index finger on his lips, waved his arms, and the people standing on the stools followed suit and slowly sat down according to his instructions.
0:56:4|0:56:10|[Huo An] sat next to him, leaning on a wooden platform.
0:58:12|0:58:22|The Roman Light quickly came to an end, just as the lyrics sang, tears streaming down the faces of Roman soldiers, believing firmly that the triumphal song would forever resound in the city of Rome.
0:58:22|0:58:36|The little prince finished singing with a smile, took a step back, and was then lifted around the waist by [Huo An]. Subsequently, [Lao Shu] walked to the edge of the wooden platform, took the little prince, and carried him towards the military tent. Watching the direction the little prince was leaving, [Huo An] couldn't help but clap and bid farewell.
0:58:39|0:58:51|The crowd soon snapped out of the mournful mood. Although not as fluent in the language of the Romans as [Huo An], the hidden power in the singing made everyone couldn't help but applaud.
0:58:53|0:59:0|Roman soldiers, seeing this scene, also emerged from their sorrow, wiped away the tears on their faces, and applauded vigorously with both hands.
0:59:43|0:59:54|Having poisoned his own younger brother and even patricide to seize the throne, [Lu Kuisi] had no choice but to lead his army to escort the young prince all the way east, after poisoning the potion given by the queen.
1:0:10|1:0:13|It is to retrieve the peace agreement signed by Kurasu and the queen, in order to prove the great betrayal of Prince Tibis.
1:0:13|1:0:23|Finishing speaking, he lowered his head and took a sip of wine, then placed his hands on the steps behind him, lifted his head, and looked towards the sky. [Huo An] listened and raised his bowl, speaking.
1:0:37|1:0:51|During a escape, his sister, frightened and crying uncontrollably, was silenced by [Huo An] with his hands to avoid alerting the pursuers. And so, [Huo An] killed his only living relative in the world with his own hands.
1:0:51|1:1:1|It was at this moment that [Huo An] encountered Huo Qubing who came to rescue him. He was fortunate to be saved in the chaos of battle and remembered the words that would influence his entire life.
1:1:13|1:1:18|Admiring the two's hardship, [Lu Kuisi]'s soldiers shouted and quickly ran to them.
1:1:20|1:1:28|The soldier continued, saying that the brothers who had previously gone to the Kingdom of Anxi had returned. As [Lu Kuisi] strode into the military tent,
1:1:28|1:1:33|Looking up, Huo An saw his deputy, tears streaming down his face, sitting on a box with blood all over.
1:1:33|1:1:57|Following that, the deputy remembered that a group of six people were originally rushing towards the direction of the Kingdom of Anxi at full speed. Suddenly, they heard the sound of neighing horses coming from ahead. The group quickly dismounted and climbed up a nearby hill. Down in the valley below, there were neatly arranged infantry and cavalry troops, with the Crown Prince Tibis casually sitting on his warhorse, clad in heavy armor.
1:1:59|1:2:7|Huo An expressed concern that Tiberius probably already knew about Lu Kuisi's plan.
1:2:7|1:2:12|The young prince sitting on the bed quietly called for [Lu Kuisi] after hearing these words.
1:2:44|1:2:51|With both hands, [Huo An] gently lifts the head of the Little Prince and plants a tender kiss on his forehead.
1:3:3|1:3:9|If [Huo An] comes to help, then Tiberius will shift his anger onto him. The city that everyone spent 15 days repairing is just a dream.
1:3:30|1:3:37|Tiberius must have colluded with the governor, and the role of the Protectorate is to maintain peace on the Silk Road. Therefore, [Huo An] plans to return to the Protectorate and borrow troops from his comrade [Yin Po].
1:3:37|1:3:46|When the time comes, the conspiracy between Tiberius and the governor will definitely be exposed. This plan will then draw a light gasp from the young prince.
1:4:1|1:4:4|Appoint [Huo An] as the leader of the Roman legion.
1:4:4|1:4:11|The sudden appointment made [Huo An] very uneasy, and he immediately turned to look at [Lu Kuisi] beside him.
1:4:11|1:4:36|Seeing the other person smile at him, he had to turn around again to face the little prince. And as if the little prince could see, in the instant that [Huo An] turned around, he reached out his little hand to signal him to come closer. Then, [Huo An] took a step forward, retreated on one leg, knelt in front of the little prince, and finally, with both palms facing upwards, carefully tucked the Roman short sword into his arms, declaring himself very honored.
1:4:38|1:4:44|With the hopes of everyone, [Huo An] rode towards the Protectorate with his horse.
1:4:46|1:5:5|Returning to a few days ago, when [Mountain Leopard] and his group of six discovered the army of one hundred thousand, clad in heavy armor, Tiberius, who was sitting next to the Long Shoulder with a pot in hand, slowly rose from his throne and walked with a casual pace to an open space. [Mountain Leopard] and several subordinates of [Lu Kuisi] were kneeling on the ground.
1:5:7|1:5:24|Seeing the people around him being beheaded and falling to the ground, as it was about to be his turn, [Mountain Leopard] stepped forward like a black panther. He grabbed the soldier's neck with one hand, snatched the opponent's long sword with the other hand, turned around, and pointed the sword at Tiberius.
1:5:24|1:5:31|Without getting close, he was pierced through the chest by the opponent's sword, and the mirror-like blade was instantly covered in blood.
1:5:32|1:5:41|Tiberius said nothing, turned around, threw the sword to the soldier who arrived late to protect the carriage, and left without any emotion in his heart.
1:5:42|1:5:50|Silently watching everything, the strategist Agrippa couldn't help but walk up to Tiberius and say, "We have gone too far now."
1:6:2|1:6:31|When faced with reprimand, Tiberius not only remained calm inside, but also took the initiative to approach Agricola closely and, in a hoarse voice, solemnly stated that everything he had done was destined, because since childhood he had a wish, which was to kill his own biological father. And at the moment when his dream came true, he shared this joyous event with his father.
1:6:31|1:6:36|Outside the heavily guarded Yanmen Pass at this moment.
1:6:40|1:6:50|The Roman soldiers, ready for battle, stood in the desert, and [Lu Kuisi] quickly returned to the city upon hearing this.
1:6:53|1:6:57|In the grand hall, soldiers wearing black armor and headscarves bowed their heads in acknowledgment to [Lu Kuisi].
1:6:58|1:7:5|Not yet entering the door, Huo An found Hua Gao looking uneasy. After a moment of hesitation, he walked to the center of the main hall.
1:7:5|1:7:12|Next, we see General Huo An's subordinate, [Ma Chuang], standing with cold eyes by the side of the young prince.
1:7:16|1:7:26|[Lu Kuisi] felt uneasy even before seeing [Huo An], and upon hearing the loud cries of the Little Prince and Hua Gao, he instantly realized that he was already trapped.
1:7:36|1:7:44|In the howling of the Little Prince, [Lu Kuisi] held a short sword, a cold light flashed, and a chill arose in his hand.
1:7:56|1:8:6|[Ma Chuan] saw the situation turning bad, shot an arrow into the left knee of [Lu Kuisi]. Seeing him still riding forward with a broken sword, [Ma Chuan] swiftly circled behind [Lu Kuisi] and thrust a sword into his back chest.
1:8:8|1:8:10|The ambush succeeded, [Lu Kuisi] knelt on the ground in a sorry state.
1:8:10|1:8:14|The soldier, holding a short knife, hesitated for a moment and then kicked him in the back when he was off guard.
1:8:22|1:8:32|The cries that the Little Prince made to make him leave were still ringing in his ears, but [Lu Kuisi] turned a deaf ear, trembling his arms, propping up his body, and continuously moving forward.
1:8:32|1:8:41|[Ma Chuan] saw this, as if also caught up in the fun, whenever [Lu Kuisi] stood up, he would strike the opponent's face with the scabbard.
1:8:41|1:8:49|The force was so great that it directly flipped him over. The scene then shifts to a small study in the city.
1:8:58|1:9:5|Huo An, who arrived in time, grabbed the collar of the soldier and threw him aside, then took the long sword and knocked out the soldier pressing down on Xiu Qing.
1:9:5|1:9:13|The sound of the fight quickly caught the attention of other soldiers in the alley.
1:9:13|1:9:21|[Huo An] raised the back of his knife and engaged in close combat, driving back the soldiers who came to reinforce with just a few moves, then protecting [Xiu Qing] behind him.
1:9:23|1:9:30|At this moment, a soldier hiding beside the haystack raised his sword to strike, but before he could take a step, he was met with an arrow head-on.
1:9:30|1:9:34|On the rooftop, [Leng Yue] lowered her bow and looked askance.
1:9:34|1:9:47|Not far away, soldiers kept pouring out of the city gate. [Huo An] made a quick decision and ordered [Xiu Qing] to look after the children.
1:9:47|1:9:54|[Leng Yue] also quickly took [Hong Ri] into the small study to hide. When the soldiers pushed open the door outside, they shot cold arrows through the window.
1:10:13|1:10:18|[Leng Yue] may hit the target every time, but unfortunately, there are too many people outside the house.
1:10:24|1:10:27|Huo An hurriedly urged Xiu Qing and the children to escape to the second floor upon discovering that the soldiers were about to press in at the door.
1:10:28|1:10:32|Then quickly surveyed the situation inside the house.
1:10:32|1:10:40|Push open the half-height window immediately, then tie one end of the long vine hanging inside the house tightly, and throw the other end down from the window.
1:10:42|1:10:50|Leng Yue pulled back her longbow and crouched at the staircase on the second floor. Any soldier who showed their head would be shot dead.
1:10:51|1:11:3|At this moment, [Huo An] climbed out of the window, grabbed the long vine, and quickly descended to the backyard of the small study. Once he stood firm, he hurriedly wrapped the vine around his waist, then with a big hand gesture, a slide made of cloth appeared in front of him.
1:11:4|1:11:13|[Xiu Qing] quickly lined up the children one by one, helped them onto the long vine, and carefully slid them down.
1:11:23|1:11:29|The pursuers had already poured into the staircase. [Leng Yue], sensing the danger, quickly pushed over a bookshelf towards them.
1:11:34|1:11:40|Leaping and flipping over, [Huo An] jumps back into the long vine, then swiftly shoots an arrow to block the pursuer's throat.
1:11:40|1:11:46|[Huo An] immediately dropped the long vine and ran towards the alley entrance.
1:11:50|1:11:55|Seeing [Huo An] and the others changing direction and passing through the distillery, the soldiers hurried to catch up.
1:11:55|1:12:1|The leader had just stepped over the threshold when he was met with an arrow, as [Hong Ri] had been waiting here quietly for a long time.
1:12:3|1:12:12|The enraged soldiers were about to continue their pursuit. Inside the wine shop, [Hong Ri]'s men quickly pressed against the door, shooting cold arrows directly at the enemy's faces.
1:12:13|1:12:22|At this moment, [Huo An] led the group to turn into the center of the market. After meeting up with [Leng Yue], [Hong Ri] stood at the front of the line, aiming towards the alley.
1:12:23|1:12:27|The soldiers had just taken a step forward when they were struck by a flying arrow piercing their throats.
1:12:39|1:12:45|[Huo An] saw the intense battle here and quickly instructed the children to follow [Xiu Qing] and leave first.
1:12:45|1:12:52|The archers had closed in at this point, amidst the chaos of arrows, successfully shooting through the chest of [Hong Ri]'s subordinate.
1:12:52|1:12:59|Upon witnessing this scene, [Hong Ri] immediately turned around, pulled his bow, and shot an arrow that pierced through a bamboo pole and nailed the soldiers.
1:13:4|1:13:18|Seeing [Huo An] pick up a wooden board and hold it in front of [Leng Yue] and himself, [Hong Ri] shouted to hurry. Unfortunately, a Nan Di child dropped his book on the ground while escaping, and [Xiu Qing] watched him turn around to pick it up, disregarding the danger to join the pursuit.
1:13:21|1:13:45|[Xiu Qing] actually used her body to shield the child, with two long arrows piercing straight into her neck and back. [Huo An] was shocked and quickly stood up a wooden board to protect himself, then went behind the two. With one hand, he helped [Xiu Qing] up and slowly moved towards the end of the alley, but in an instant, the wooden board was filled with long swords, and some arrows even directly pierced into [Huo An]'s shoulder.
1:13:45|1:13:50|Finally, the three of them moved slowly into the blind spot of the soldiers' vision.
1:13:51|1:13:59|[Huo An] quickly pushed the child aside. On the other side, to save [Hong Ri], he used his back as a shield in front of him.
1:14:0|1:14:7|With a gritted teeth, he said, "Brother, farewell." [Hong Ri] then swiftly unsheathed his long sword and shot angrily with his bow.
1:14:9|1:14:20|[Huo An] saw a group of people in deep trouble, quickly rushed to the edge of the alley, pulled a cart filled with straw, dodged the whizzing cold arrows, and then used a shovel to lift the blazing charcoal fire on the side of the road.
1:14:21|1:14:29|Chunks of charcoal scattered in the air, instantly igniting flames and crashing towards the soldiers outside the cart.
1:14:30|1:14:42|Continuing, picking up two cans of wine and tossing them into the air, without needing to say much, [Hong Ri] already understood [Huo An]'s plan, shooting two arrows in a row to pierce the wine bottles. In an instant, the carts in front of everyone were engulfed in flames.
1:14:43|1:14:53|Taking advantage of the opportunity, [Huo An] turned around and picked up the already fainted [Xiu Qing], quickly running out of the market. They arrived in the desert,
1:14:53|1:15:8|Xiu Qing, with her chest stained black with blood, lay on the ground with cold sweat seeping through her dark hair. Ignoring the pain, she gently held Huo An's hand and said.
1:15:11|1:15:19|[Xiu Qing] couldn't help but use her delicate hand, covered in gray gauze, to stroke [Huo An]'s cheek.
1:15:20|1:15:29|Eyes as if soaked in dew, shining.
1:15:32|1:15:38|Before Huo An could finish the three words, Xiu Qing's hand slid from his cheek to his chest.
1:15:38|1:15:46|Finally, leaning weakly on his arm, [Xiu Qing] looked at him with a smile on her lips and her eyes closed.
1:15:46|1:15:54|[Huo An] stood with his hands hanging in front of him, tears streaming down his face. Inside the ancient city of Loulan, [Lu Kuisi] leaned against a heavy lock with his feet.
1:15:54|1:16:2|His legs were bent and suspended on the iron frame, the only thing keeping him upright were the iron chains as thick as wrists wrapped around his arms.
1:16:4|1:16:13|Under heavy guard, soldiers patrolled outside the prison cell. At this moment, [Tiberius] stood leisurely in front of the prison gate.
1:16:13|1:16:21|After the four soldiers pushed open the gate together, he stepped inside. The soldiers outside quickly turned the gears connected to the iron chains.
1:16:21|1:16:36|[Lu Kuisi] was slowly lifted into the air, looking at the pained expression on his face. Smiling, [Tiberius] said, "Welcome home," expressing his long-awaited anticipation for this moment.
1:17:21|1:17:36|When it comes to the point, [Tiberius] bluntly stated that he had already colluded with [Huo An]'s subordinate [Yin Po]. Once the hundred thousand elite soldiers arrive at the border of the Han Dynasty, [Yin Po] will hand over the border defense seal and military orders.
1:17:37|1:17:45|By then, the entire Silk Road will be under the control of the Roman Empire, at the cost of owning all of this.
1:18:9|1:18:18|After all, a child without any weapons poses no threat. [Lu Kuisi] looked down at this and murmured softly.
1:18:42|1:18:57|Continuing, Huo An recalled the scene on the pillar platform, where the wind and sand carried the setting sun, blowing onto the damaged pillar platform. Huo An led a part of the elite team, constantly approaching the high place where the princess was holding the little prince and retreating.
1:19:19|1:19:32|At this moment, with no way out, Huo Gao saw Lu Kuisi signaling for him to jump off the platform. After closing his eyes tightly and taking a deep breath, he hugged the little prince tightly and fell backwards.
1:19:34|1:19:40|Thus, the two fell into an endless abyss. Upon learning that the Little Prince had been driven to a dead end, [Lu Kuisi] gritted his teeth.
1:19:44|1:19:48|The air seemed to have frozen into sharp ice chips, while [Tiberius] strolled nonchalantly on the execution platform.
1:19:50|1:19:56|After a while, it was announced that the Little Prince had died, and there was no longer any conflict between [Lu Kuisi] and him.
1:19:56|1:20:11|After speaking, Tiberius walked back to [Lu Kuisi] and whispered in his ear, revealing a secret that when he looked in the mirror recently, he found the reflection to bear a striking resemblance to [Lu Kuisi].
1:20:14|1:20:21|With a swift motion, [Lu Kuisi] grabbed the iron chain and struck Tiberius in the face.
1:20:30|1:20:39|Otherwise, everything becomes dull and boring. After speaking, he drew out a short knife from his side and used the tip of the knife to sketch the face of [Lu Kuisi], his gaze fierce.
1:20:42|1:21:1|Huo An, who arrived late, was squatting inside the Yanmen Pass, looking at the Roman legion flag being trampled on the ground, lost in thought. Yan Tou led a group of soldiers standing in front of the city gate, apologizing to him in a low voice.
1:21:4|1:21:6|[Lao Shu] hesitated for a while, then immediately agreed.
1:21:7|1:21:15|Next, [Huo An] saw the two men pushing and shoving, so he squinted his eyes and spoke.
1:21:20|1:21:31|At that time, the deputy of Tiberius, holding a short sword, stood in front of the gate of Yanmen Pass and said, "In the future, the countries along the Silk Road will be reorganized by the Roman Empire."
1:21:39|1:21:44|Tiberius raised his eyes and looked at the Bai Rong chieftain who was pressed in front of him.
1:22:7|1:22:15|Unreasonable demands made [Leng Yue] furious. For a moment, [Huo An] and his group were surrounded by the 36 tribes in the city holding sticks.
1:22:38|1:22:47|When the Southern Di, Wusun, and Turks had vented their anger, the previously silent [Lu Kuisi] cleared his throat and spoke loudly, saying that he had been bossed around his whole life, and this time, it was time to make a choice on his own.
1:22:50|1:22:57|The man's shout quickly resonated with others, who angrily yelled at [Yan Tou] to hand over [Huo An].
1:22:58|1:23:8|[Huo An] saw the situation, with a calm expression, he raised his head and looked towards [Yan Tou].
1:23:10|1:23:20|[Huo An], holding the legion flag, looked around at the crowd wielding sticks.
1:23:21|1:23:30|He gritted his teeth, his gaze firm. [Leng Yue] put down the knife in astonishment and walked up to [Huo An].
1:24:0|1:24:6|[Leng Yue] was startled and quickly followed by [Huo An], who said as soon as she approached.
1:24:7|1:24:16|At this moment, [Huo An] walked towards the armor of [Huo Qubing].
1:24:54|1:24:58|The tribe that was originally dancing with knives and guns loosened their weapons after listening.
1:25:10|1:25:19|[Huo An] shed tears as he spoke, deeply moving everyone to tears as well.
1:25:19|1:25:27|Next, [Huo An] sniffed and raised the corners of his mouth as he surveyed the faces of the crowd.
1:25:51|1:25:58|A tear rolled down Huo An's cheek as he spoke.
1:26:0|1:26:9|[Huo An] looked up at the sky with deep emotion.
1:26:11|1:26:17|[Leng Yue] looked at [Huo An], who was already in tears, and lowered her head.
1:26:21|1:26:28|Suddenly hearing [Huo An] speaking as if he were giving final instructions, [Leng Yue] couldn't help but tremble all over.
1:26:29|1:26:38|So in front of Huo Qubing's armor, the flags of the thirty-six countries were divided on both sides and were slowly pulled up into the sky with a piece of hemp rope.
1:26:38|1:26:46|After witnessing this scene with his own eyes, [Yan Tou] and [Lao Shu] put handcuffs on [Huo An] and walked towards the direction of the ancient city of Loulan.
1:26:46|1:26:53|A small team quickly crossed the desert and, led by Vice General Tubo, headed towards the ancient city.
1:26:55|1:26:59|At this moment, [Lao Shu] and [Yan Tou] reminisced.
1:27:30|1:27:36|[Huo An] guessed that [Lu Kuisi] must be imprisoned in the cell based on the information provided by the informant [Lao Shu].
1:27:36|1:27:45|The Vice Commander Tiberius, not knowing the intentions of the three, then led them through a heavy gate and to the end of a small path.
1:27:45|1:27:57|All of [Lu Kuisi]'s subordinates, who were all locked in iron cages, saw [Huo An] leaning against the handcuffs. They angrily grabbed the iron cages tightly, and the copper locks on the cages made clanging sounds under the pressure.
1:27:59|1:28:4|[Huo An], who couldn't stay long, was quickly pushed onto the main street and arrived at the grand hall.
1:28:5|1:28:9|Sitting on the throne, Tiberius looked at a furious [Huo An] and smiled.
1:28:47|1:28:54|[Yan Tou] and [Lao Shu] quickly pretended to step forward and hold him back. Seeing Tibis suddenly sit up straight, [Huo An] quietly questioned.
1:28:56|1:29:1|Will [Yin Po] really give up the Silk Road for a position as a governor of a protectorate?
1:29:1|1:29:4|When Tiberius asked [Yin Po] if there was a problem,
1:29:17|1:29:26|Tiberius' face turned cold instantly, [Huo An] took a breath without showing any signs, glanced sideways and met eyes with [Yan Tou] beside him.
1:29:28|1:29:50|Outside the city, [Yin Po] looked at the dark army and quickly stopped. The captain beside him took out a seal about the length of a forearm from a wooden box, but [Yin Po] ignored it and signaled Ma Chuang, and the two rode forward. In the midst of the army, [Lao Shu] asked softly.
1:30:10|1:30:16|[Yan Tou] pushed [Huo An] into the iron cage, then clapped his hands and walked up to the deputy general, demanding the agreed-upon gold coins.
1:30:30|1:30:33|[Yan Tou] immediately removed the handcuffs from [Huo An].
1:30:33|1:30:40|At this moment, [Yin Po] dismounted and walked with Ma Chao and the other five people to the front of Tiberius. Then he extended his hands and smiled as he spoke.
1:30:50|1:30:57|So he also followed the agreement and exchanged with the border pass, but unexpectedly, Tiberius mentioned [Huo An].
1:31:2|1:31:10|At this moment, [Huo An] was crouching in the center of the iron cage. After quietly explaining his plan, he instructed the soldiers to disperse and guard the railings of the cage.
1:31:10|1:31:18|With the combined efforts of everyone, the iron cage was lifted more than two inches high. The shaking sound alarmed the soldiers guarding not far away.
1:31:20|1:31:30|With the help of [Huo An]'s strength, the subordinates of [Lu Kuisi] pushed their shoulders against the other end of the iron cage. In an instant, the cage tilted and fell into a passage over three meters high.
1:31:32|1:31:45|The sturdy railing broke apart, and as they walked to the end, a soldier in another cell shouted excitedly, "[Huo An], quickly throw the key to the bronze lock over here."
1:31:46|1:31:54|As the soldiers reached out of the iron cage to unlock it in reverse, a wave of guards descended the steps with short swords in hand.
1:32:2|1:32:7|On the side, the soldier pulled open the bronze lock, used his body to block the blade, and rushed out through the gate.
1:32:7|1:32:10|After Sima saw the signal arrow, he gestured to the people around him.
1:32:12|1:32:17|In the midst of the troops, [Huo An]'s subordinate pulled his longbow taut and shot an arrow straight into the throat of a Tiberius cavalryman.
1:32:25|1:32:31|Tiberius, noticing the situation not far away, turned to the counselor [Agrippa].
1:32:48|1:33:1|As long as [Yin Po] is killed, the position of the Protectorate Prefect will belong to him. Upon seeing this, [Yin Po] quickly grasped the hilt of the knife. Then, the two exchanged glances, silently and tacitly, and simultaneously drew their knives to strike at Tiberius.
1:33:1|1:33:10|Before he could even make a move, Huo An was met with a long sword piercing his forehead. After his neck was slashed, he breathed his last breath.
1:33:10|1:33:17|In the chaos, soldiers swarmed in and pierced the chest of [Yin Po], leaving only him in the blink of an eye.
1:33:17|1:33:27|In a fit of anger, he raised his long sword and swung it towards Tiberius, but to his surprise, the latter dodged and struck back, causing [Yin Po] to bleed from his back and thighs in an instant.
1:33:27|1:33:36|But [Yin Po] still unwilling to give up, raised his sword and attacked Tiberius again. In the blink of an eye, his right wrist holding the sword was chopped off.
1:33:36|1:33:45|Yin Po, paralyzed by pain, froze in place. Tiberius took the opportunity to circle around him and then swung his long sword, piercing through his chest heavily.
1:33:45|1:33:54|Licking the fresh blood on his hand, [Huo An] led a group of Roman soldiers and guards into a melee in the city of Loulan.
1:33:56|1:34:12|After snatching a sword that was attacking him, [Huo An] dodged and quickly made his way towards the prison where [Lu Kuisi] was held. Soon, he reached the platform, put on his protective gear, and swiftly dealt with two guards in just a few moves.
1:34:13|1:34:18|At this moment, the guards outside the city quickly reported to Tiberius that there was a big disturbance in the prison inside the city.
1:34:20|1:34:28|Tiberius muttered to himself that it must be [Huo An] behind this, so he quickly pointed angrily at his men with the tip of his sword and said in a deep voice, "Send reinforcements immediately."
1:34:28|1:34:36|He sheathed his sword and leaned it diagonally on the throne behind him, looking at the crowd fighting on the battlefield with a cold smile.
1:34:36|1:34:44|Within the ancient city, [Huo An] finally finished off the guards in front of him, and with the help of the Roman soldiers, he pushed open the gates of the prison.
1:34:44|1:34:51|The Roman soldier saw that there was still an iron gate in front of [Lu Kuisi], so he hurried back outside the cell and struggled to turn the gears.
1:34:54|1:35:6|[Huo An] took the opportunity to pick up a knife from the weapon rack next to the door. After the iron gate rose, he continuously used it to cut the iron chain on [Lu Kuisi]'s forearm, trying to rescue him.
1:35:16|1:35:29|Lu Kuisi's eyes were gouged out, under his furrowed brows, his face almost covered in blood. He then shook his disheveled and damp hair, opened his hand hanging on the iron chain, signaling Huo An to shake hands with him.
1:35:32|1:35:37|[Huo An] had just knelt down when he heard [Lu Kuisi] asking, "This is a Roman family matter, why get involved?"
1:35:38|1:35:45|Frantically hacking at the iron chains, [Huo An] replied in a hurry that it was his duty.
1:36:13|1:36:18|Everyone who guards this city with him will be his eternal friends.
1:36:21|1:36:29|Unexpectedly, as soon as the words fell, the guards lying in ambush at the top lifted the wine barrel and splashed it towards the prison cell, hanging on the wall, on the burning torches.
1:36:29|1:36:36|[Huo An] staggered back, and as he looked up, he saw the towering flames surrounding [Lu Kuisi] at the waist.
1:36:36|1:36:41|He immediately took off his robe and hurriedly threw it towards the flames in front of him.
1:36:59|1:37:5|Otherwise, [Huo An] and the Roman legion will both be buried here.
1:37:6|1:37:15|Huo An took a step back at Lu Kuisi's heart-wrenching cry, picked up the Roman short sword and Lu Kuisi's headband that had fallen at his feet.
1:37:16|1:37:22|[Huo An], who was about to escape from the prison cell, heard the trembling voice and instantly understood what was happening.
1:37:22|1:37:30|He slowly turned around, glanced at the weapon rack by the door, took a few deep breaths, and then walked towards it.
1:37:31|1:37:38|After a moment of contemplation, he raised his hand and picked up a crossbow from the rack, then aimed the arrow straight at [Lu Kuisi] with difficulty.
1:37:43|1:37:52|Upon hearing [Lu Kuisi] pleading for him to go home in a sorrowful tone, [Huo An], who was originally firm, instantly closed his eyes and bowed his head.
1:37:53|1:38:2|As he raised his head again, tears were already in his eyes. Then, he stared at [Lu Kuisi] and said with trembling lips.
1:38:3|1:38:10|As soon as the words fell, [Huo An] gritted his teeth and pulled the trigger, the short arrow cutting through the rolling heat wave, heading straight towards [Lu Kuisi].
1:38:11|1:38:19|At that moment, [Lu Kuisi] seemed to be transported back to the magnificent and enchanting Roman palace.
1:38:19|1:38:28|Seeing [Lu Kuisi] with an arrow piercing his throat and smiling with closed eyes, [Huo An] picked up his headband and tied it around his forehead before turning away.
1:38:29|1:38:33|Outside the prison gates, the sound of crowded footsteps fills the air, echoing in every corner.
1:38:36|1:38:42|It turned out to be a small road inside, with two rows of guards holding shields and crossbows, running orderly towards them.
1:38:42|1:38:48|Roman soldiers and [Yan Tou]'s men quickly crouched at the top of the steps, holding their swords in hand to stay alert.
1:38:48|1:38:58|However, at the command of the guard, the hidden crossbowmen behind the long shields simultaneously released their cold arrows. Four Roman soldiers were instantly hit, lost their balance, and tumbled down the steps.
1:38:58|1:39:6|The guards immediately formed a long line, ushering the soldiers in front of them, then picked up their long spears and stabbed wildly at the enemy's chest.
1:39:12|1:39:21|After he roughly stopped the bleeding, he suddenly noticed the scattered rocks at his feet.
1:39:21|1:39:28|The soldiers quickly regained their senses and began to frantically overturn the scattered rocks around them, vigorously smashing them towards the guards below the steps.
1:39:28|1:39:35|Originally holding long shields and advancing in a row, the guards were smashed into a disarray.
1:39:37|1:39:41|It seems this move can break the Escaping Armor Formation. [Huo An] shouted loudly for everyone to pick up larger stones.
1:39:41|1:39:52|Watching as the guard continued to walk up with a tall shield, the Roman soldiers, along with [Huo An], finally pushed down the large stone block that was four people wide and one person long.
1:39:53|1:39:59|[Yan Tou]'s men were also not weak at all, lifting up a stone pillar together and smashing it towards the guards once again.
1:40:4|1:40:11|In front of the Dujia formation, a large opening was finally torn open by a giant stone, and [Huo An] quickly led everyone to charge straight down.
1:40:11|1:40:16|However, after taking the guard's long sword, [Huo An] found it difficult to bring himself to kill.
1:40:19|1:40:23|But just as they let the other party go, they were ambushed by another group of people, and a long spear pierced their abdomen.
1:40:23|1:40:28|Roman soldiers were unwilling to engage in combat with their compatriots, only angrily ordering them to leave.
1:40:34|1:40:39|Seeing the guards fleeing in all directions, the group wasted no time in leaving the scene, urging each other to depart quickly.
1:40:42|1:40:48|Just as they turned into a narrow alley, the soldiers caught sight of the guards in heavy armor, armed with short arrows, converging from the east and north.
1:41:3|1:41:9|Roman soldiers listened. With a hoarse voice, [Lu Kuisi] shouted loudly.
1:41:9|1:41:17|Huo An then rallied his troops and ordered them to form up for battle. [Huo An], along with [Yan Tou] and his men, together with the Roman soldiers, immediately raised their long shields and charged straight at the three defensive lines.
1:41:17|1:41:23|Suddenly, [Huo An] caught sight of the large scattered rocks beside him, and he recalled the scene of the Romans cleverly using long shields when building the city at Yanmen Pass.
1:41:29|1:41:33|Under his command, the team quickly formed a spear-shaped charging formation.
1:41:34|1:41:41|In front, the Long Spear Army pierced through the shields, while behind them stood giant stones on top of double shields, with a few armored soldiers on both sides.
1:41:42|1:41:45|The group worked together to push the giant stone array forward bravely.
1:41:52|1:41:59|Unexpectedly, as soon as the city gate opened, [Huo An] and the others looked up to see the guards at the rear of Tiberius's army, who turned around and glared at them angrily.
1:42:0|1:42:6|The long spear pointed directly at the small team, so [Huo An] quickly led everyone to climb up the nearby low hill.
1:42:8|1:42:10|Unfortunately, he was discovered by the scheming minister Agrippa.
1:42:10|1:42:17|Leading the group up the hill, [Huo An] and his soldiers looked at the hundred thousand strong army waiting in formation ahead, instantly falling into despair.
1:42:28|1:42:36|But [Huo An] had already burned his bridges and shouted, "If you're brothers, then die together." Looking at [Huo An] and his comrades who seemed almost reckless,
1:42:36|1:42:45|Tiberius, with a demonic look on his face, managed to crack a smile. Suddenly, the disturbance in the sky caught his attention.
1:42:45|1:42:53|Looking back, a dark mass of eagles that seemed to fill the sky was swooping down towards the army of one hundred thousand.
1:42:53|1:42:59|Even with the guards holding long shields and short swords, they were still no match for the raptor swooping down from high above.
1:42:59|1:43:8|From the sky to the battlefield, they pierced through the air above people's heads in a matter of seconds, then brazenly snatched the guards' eyeballs.
1:43:8|1:43:20|Tiberius, feeling uneasy, quickly looked into the distance. Suddenly, on the towering mountain to the north, a mix of sand and countless cavalry appeared.
1:43:21|1:43:28|Looking towards the west, the white chief with a round hat led the cavalry holding wolf-tooth clubs, just having crossed over the mountain top.
1:43:29|1:43:34|At this moment, the Turpan cavalry wrapped in long gauze came rushing from the south with knives.
1:43:34|1:43:39|And on the eastern hill, a large number of soldiers from Kucha also surged in.
1:43:39|1:43:44|Before long, troops from the Thirty-Six Kingdoms gathered from all directions.
1:43:44|1:43:48|Even [Huo An] was stunned.
1:43:49|1:43:53|The first to arrive, Huo An's men were the first to sound the drums of attack.
1:43:53|1:44:2|[Leng Yue] took the lead, galloping down from the hill with a long bow and a sharp sword on his back. Chief Huo An also refused to fall behind, leading soldiers with a solemn war drum ready for battle.
1:44:2|1:44:11|Brandishing his curved blade, [Huo An] pointed directly at the 100,000 troops of Tiberius. The Southern Di people then beat the bronze drums and galloped down from the mountain.
1:44:15|1:44:19|The people of Kucha blew the long horns at this time, their footsteps filling the sky, heads held high as they pushed forward with all their might.
1:44:20|1:44:27|The following Uighur people then raised heavy hammers to strike the bronze gongs, and in an instant, the cavalry whipped their horses and charged straight down.
1:44:28|1:44:37|The Turks were orderly beating the oxhide drums behind the formation, and the soldiers rode their horses to the drumbeats, rushing down the hill like arrows released from a bow.
1:44:39|1:44:46|The army of Tiberius is surrounded by circling eagles, facing enemies from all directions.
1:44:48|1:44:57|At this moment, [Hong Ri] rode up to [Leng Yue] and shouted for her to go rescue [Huo An]. After that, he led a large group of soldiers straight towards the direction of the hundred thousand army.
1:44:59|1:45:5|Seeing the army about to be surrounded by the coalition forces of thirty-six countries, Tiberius spread his arms and shouted to prepare for battle.
1:45:7|1:45:24|Accompanied by the thunderous and rhythmic war drums, the cavalry on the outermost edge of the army swiftly changed direction and charged towards the four corners of the compass. However, it was still difficult to resist the long-awaited murderous intent of the united army.
1:45:24|1:45:32|[Hong Ri] and his men rode through the ranks, their hands rising and falling with their swords, quickly splitting the guard's shield in half.
1:45:35|1:45:40|The Xiongnu warrior dismounted and approached the infantry formation, swinging a sling with a stone in it towards the enemy.
1:45:40|1:45:52|The raised sand instantly made the guard squint his eyes. Seeing this, the Huns raised their long scarves to cover their mouths and noses, then raised their long knives to charge into the formation.
1:45:53|1:46:2|Seeing the success of the attack, the Wusun people also launched a counterattack using the same tactics. Where the stones fell, the guards were all knocked unconscious and fell to the ground.
1:46:2|1:46:11|On the other side, [Huo An] and his group had to retreat from the top of the low hill, while the guards were continuously fighting their way up from the foot of the mountain.
1:46:11|1:46:19|At the critical moment, [Leng Yue] shot a cold arrow from behind the guard, attracting the opponent's attention. Then.
1:46:19|1:46:26|Charging on horseback, [Huo An] and his men rushed towards the guards with long shields and spears. The neatly arranged formation was instantly broken up.
1:46:27|1:46:36|The guards abandoned their horses and scattered. [Huo An] quickly signaled everyone to retreat down the mountain, then he moved towards [Leng Yue].
1:46:44|1:46:51|Watching [Huo An] holding his abdomen and staunching the bleeding in pain, [Leng Yue] sat upright on the horse, staring with watery eyes, showing a firm resolve.
1:46:55|1:46:59|Finally, Tiberius was annoyed by the chaotic offensive in front of him, then he raised his long sword and roared to attack.
1:47:0|1:47:5|The brightly armored guard not only beat the drums this time, but also had six people blowing the long horns.
1:47:5|1:47:13|The guards, who had been repeatedly frustrated, now seemed to have undergone a transformation, killing several soldiers of the coalition forces in the chaos of battle one after another.
1:47:13|1:47:24|The long spear pierced through the soldier's chest and abdomen with a cold light, spraying blood into the desert, soon to be buried by the flying sand.
1:47:24|1:47:30|The leaders of Kucha and Wusun were also surrounded by guards in the chaos, with bullets hitting their hearts directly.
1:47:30|1:47:35|The skilled [Lao Shu] was ambushed and pierced through the abdomen by a sword.
1:47:35|1:47:41|[Yan Tou], who fought fiercely, was accidentally pushed down by a guard and then stabbed in the side by someone.
1:47:58|1:48:4|Upon another glance, [Huo An] saw the two of them spitting blood from their mouths, both collapsing at the foot of the mountain.
1:48:4|1:48:10|Yin Po, the Chanyu who was slashed on the elbow, back, and leg, fell straight to the ground.
1:48:10|1:48:16|Hong Ri, who arrived late, could only watch helplessly as the guard chopped off his head with a single stroke.
1:48:16|1:48:23|[Red Sun], driven to a frenzy, had his belly slashed open by the guard in a fit of rage.
1:48:24|1:48:32|At this moment, a falcon let out a long cry, its talons aiming straight for the guard's eyes. Sensing the danger, [Hong Ri] quickly got up and struck with a sword to seal the opponent's throat.
1:48:32|1:48:39|But outnumbered, [Hong Ri] found himself surrounded by guards armed with shields and swords.
1:48:39|1:48:46|Soon, they crowded him within the long shields, gradually penetrating into [Hong Ri]'s chest and abdomen through the gaps.
1:48:48|1:48:56|As Tiberius approached with his sword, the crowd dispersed and released [Hong Ri]. Then, they saw him covered in blood, still pointing his sword at Tiberius.
1:48:59|1:49:6|But he was covered in wounds and fell sideways. Tiberius hooked the corners of his mouth, enjoying his miserable death.
1:49:8|1:49:12|Suddenly, the swirling sand in the distance caught the attention of [Huo An].
1:49:13|1:49:18|Under the setting sun, a large army with rows of pointed hats and majestic horses, their banners fluttering in the wind.
1:49:18|1:49:23|As he got closer, Tiberius finally realized that these were the soldiers of Huo An's Silk Road Protection Squad.
1:49:24|1:49:31|Upon hearing the enemy blowing the horn, strategist Agrippa immediately ordered a retreat.
1:49:32|1:49:39|The guard who was originally fighting fiercely with [Huo An] and others quietly lowered his long spear and began to retreat backwards.
1:49:39|1:49:43|Before long, the troops of the Huo An kingdom had already arrived at the battlefield with their heads held high.
1:49:44|1:49:52|Originally standing beside the throne, the strategist Agrippa, who was commanding the guards to beat the war drums, suddenly flashed a look and quickly walked towards the front where Tubo was.
1:49:55|1:50:2|Tiberius, on the other hand, was staring intently at the [Queen of the Parthian Empire] not far away, her face mostly covered by a veil and adorned in magnificent attire.
1:50:5|1:50:12|At this moment, the knight beside the queen suddenly roared in anger, it was Tiberius, who killed the war god Klarus.
1:50:12|1:50:23|At the same time, it was him who blinded his own younger brother Priscus with poison. Sensing the suspicious looks from his subordinates, Tibis rebuked that this was purely absurd.
1:50:43|1:50:52|And as the Empress spoke, her attendants raised the mutual assistance agreement above their heads, displaying it to the crowd.
1:50:52|1:51:11|At this moment, Tiberius heard the questioning from [Queen of the Huns], asking him how it felt to personally kill his father and brother. He seemed to be transported back to the chamber where he poisoned the young prince. As he lowered his eyes and breathed rapidly, the counselor Agrippa appeared by his side, softly persuading him.
1:51:11|1:51:21|Now it's not too late to turn back. He then reached out his left hand, asking for the long sword from him. Tiberius gently grasped his own hand, stained with blood, and slowly handed it over.
1:51:24|1:51:32|The next moment, he unexpectedly pierced Agrigento's abdomen with an arrow, then lowered his head and whispered softly in the opponent's ear,
1:51:34|1:51:42|A true hero never looks back. After saying this, Huo An released his grip, and Agrippa widened his eyes before falling to the side.
1:51:48|1:51:53|He straightened his back and glared around angrily, declaring that it was time to settle things once and for all.
1:51:54|1:51:59|However, neither the guards nor the soldiers of the Anxi Kingdom dared to step forward to confront them.
1:52:0|1:52:6|Before Tiberius could utter his mocking words, his gaze suddenly shifted straight ahead.
1:52:7|1:52:25|It turned out to be [Huo An] limping out from the crowd with a short sword, as he approached, Tiberius stepped forward and said, if there was any mistake in this power struggle, it was underestimating the role [Huo An] played in it.
1:52:28|1:52:43|But [Huo An] disagreed, believing that Tiberius underestimated human nature. When asked why he stood up, [Huo An] simply said it was for his friend Lu Kuisi. Tiberius sneered at this.
1:53:9|1:53:23|In response to this, causing everyone to cheer, Huo An took the opportunity to declare, "Then let us settle our differences between us, I will definitely give [Huo An] a Roman funeral." As soon as he finished speaking, [Huo An] raised his sword and charged straight towards Tibis' face.
1:53:23|1:53:29|However, Tibes moved faster, dodging Huo An's fierce sword strikes, causing him to retreat five steps.
1:53:29|1:53:45|Then he mounted his horse again, the long sword in his wrist striking towards Huo An's waist and arm like lightning, but each move was blocked. Tiberius leaped up and landed, fiercely chopping towards Huo An's face.
1:53:45|1:53:51|Huo An, protecting his body with a short sword, was knocked straight to the ground by the force.
1:53:51|1:53:56|When he struggled to get up, the hand holding the sword was trembling uncontrollably.
1:53:57|1:54:10|Tiberius interestingly pointed his long sword at the wrist of [Huo An], then swiftly approached him as if a fleeting shadow, their blades clashed again before he kicked his injured thigh.
1:54:11|1:54:17|Seeing that [Huo An] still didn't give up, Tiberius swung his arms and turned to attack him.
1:54:17|1:54:21|The air stirred by the long sword seemed capable of decapitating someone.
1:54:24|1:54:32|With injuries on his body, [Huo An] felt his arm sore, retreated repeatedly, lost his weapon, and had his chest armor slashed by a sword, falling backward onto the ground.
1:54:32|1:54:38|Bright red blood quickly seeped out from the torn fabric on the chest.
1:54:39|1:54:49|Tiberius, on the contrary, seemed to be enjoying himself. He picked up a fallen short sword with his long sword and walked over to [Huo An], then bent down to hand it to him.
1:54:49|1:54:54|After taking the short sword, [Huo An] gripped the handle and swung it towards Tiberius without getting up.
1:54:54|1:55:4|After a swift dodge by him, [Huo An] staggered to his feet. He had barely made a few cuts when his sword was knocked out of his hand by Tibis.
1:55:5|1:55:14|[Huo An], without weapons, could only raise his left arm and use his armor to block Tiberius's attacks that felt as heavy as a thousand pounds.
1:55:14|1:55:30|Finally, Tiberius was provoked by a loud roar from [Huo An], who first cut off his armor with a sword, then swung an elbow towards his face, and finally angrily kicked him in the chest. Despite falling heavily on his back, [Huo An] still tried to get up.
1:55:30|1:55:39|But soon he was back on the ground. At this moment, [Tiberius] came to [Huo An]'s side, squatted down, and slowly lifted his face with a sword.
1:55:39|1:55:44|In a low voice, it was said that wearing [Lu Kuisi]'s headband was simply a bad omen.
1:55:48|1:55:52|And [Huo An] took the opportunity to reach into his waist with his right hand, drew out a dagger, and turned to stab towards [Tiberius].
1:55:52|1:56:1|Unexpectedly, the opponent saw through him at a glance, then, [Tiberius] unexpectedly grabbed [Huo An] by the neck and lifted him up.
1:56:1|1:56:9|Another hand grabbed [Huo An]'s wrist, changed direction, and the dagger stabbed straight into [Huo An]'s waist.
1:56:9|1:56:16|Looking at the suffering Huo An, Tiberius raised his hand and pulled off Lu Kuisi's headband, throwing it aside.
1:56:16|1:56:21|Then, with a gentle push of his right hand, [Huo An] fell softly to the ground.
1:56:21|1:56:24|Anxious [Leng Yue] stared with wide eyes as [Huo An] slowly crawled towards the headband.
1:56:32|1:56:43|Amidst the shouts of everyone, [Huo An] stretched out his arms and struggled to move his body, finally touching [Lu Kuisi]'s headband with his fingertips.
1:56:43|1:56:57|Disdainful [Tiberius] took a step forward, grabbed [Huo An] by the collar, making him kneel on the ground. While declaring the end of the battle, he extended his foot towards [Huo An]'s chin, slowly applying pressure to straighten his kneeling body.
1:57:4|1:57:14|Just as Tiberius raised his long sword, ready to behead, the distorted roar of [Lu Kuisi] in the cell awakened [Huo An].
1:57:16|1:57:21|Next, he used his fist gripping the trigger to strike Tibis's small elbow.
1:57:22|1:57:30|Before he could react, Tiberius had his armor on the left wrist, which was cut in half by [Huo An], scratching his neck.
1:57:30|1:57:37|Huo An then bent down, arms wrapped around Tiberius' waist, and charged straight at the guard as if going mad.
1:57:38|1:57:49|Tiberius, who hit the long shield hard, raised his hand to ask for help from the guards, but to his surprise, everyone dodged him, leaving him spitting blood and looking puzzled at the front.
1:57:50|1:57:57|The Queen of the Kingdom of Anxi then revealed the truth, that power often exposes people's greatest weaknesses.
1:57:57|1:58:10|As the sun was setting in the east, Huo An looked back and remembered his spirited appearance when he set out for the expedition. He firmly believed that a true hero never looks back.
1:58:13|1:58:20|Continuing, he gritted his teeth against the pain shooting up from his neck, bent down, and slowly pulled up [Huo An] in front of him.
1:58:21|1:58:35|With a swift and decisive motion, the dagger that had been plunged into the side was pulled out, then placed between the chests of the two men. The sound of the blade piercing flesh instantly widened [Huo An]'s eyes.
1:58:36|1:58:46|He then turned his head and looked straight at Lu Kuisi, who unexpectedly fell straight back, with a dagger stuck in his heart.
1:58:46|1:58:53|At that moment, no one could see clearly who was responsible for the dagger on the chest.
1:58:53|1:58:57|And [Huo An], too, after Tiberius fell, gasping for breath, slowly knelt down on the ground.
1:59:43|1:59:51|At this moment, a gentle breeze blew by, and he finally closed his eyes slowly.
1:59:52|2:0:1|After this battle, due to the loyalty and bravery of the Roman martyrs, Emperor Yuan of the Great Han Dynasty specially decreed to allow the Romans to establish a city on the Silk Road.
2:0:1|2:0:12|Prince Pris is of noble status, hence the name of this city in Roman meaning "king" is translated into Chinese as Li Jian.
2:0:13|2:0:20|In addition, due to Huo An's guarantee of stability along the Great Wall, the Emperor made an exception and granted his request.
2:0:20|2:0:27|Roman soldiers and the righteous men of Yanmen Pass all belong to the Protectorate, forming a new Western Region Peacekeeping Army.
2:0:28|2:0:37|After the completion of the city of Li-Jian, [Huo An] and the Roman soldiers placed General Huo Qubing's armor on a towering stone pillar in the center of the city.
2:1:27|2:1:34|But then, [Huo An] remembered the scene years ago when he met General Huo Qubing at Yanmen Pass.
2:1:34|2:1:50|At that time, Huo Qubing angrily pointed at the city, vowing to have the flags of thirty-six countries flying outside the Yanmen Pass. Now, not only has this wish been fulfilled, but the goal of coexistence with the enemy has also found tangible expression. Liqian, this ancient city, is the best proof.
2:1:54|2:2:1|The voice of Lu Kuisi's deputy pulled Huo An out of his memories, hearing the other party refer to himself as the commander of the legion.
2:2:2|2:2:8|[Huo An] once again recalled the words [Lu Kuisi] had asked on the broken city wall.
2:2:10|2:2:16|If we were to lose the friends we made today tomorrow, would it still be worth forming those bonds?
2:2:17|2:2:25|Now, looking at his deputy clad in heavy armor with a solemn expression, [Huo An] expresses his gratitude solemnly, as the answer to that question has finally been concluded.
2:2:25|2:2:36|The towering cloud armor in front of him further exemplifies the meaning of coexistence with the enemy that [Huo An] has always pursued.
2:2:36|2:2:45|Time passes, years change, and although the wings of the fierce bird made of stubborn stones have long been broken and weathered under the wind and frost.
2:2:46|2:2:54|But the meaning it represents of peace, friendship, and unity still shines brightly in the long river of history.
2:2:54|2:3:2|After reconstructing the entire story through satellite, [Kairina] was very happy to witness this history together with [Kristi].
2:3:4|2:3:12|Bowing his head to look at [Kairina] leaning on his shoulder, [Christopher] also sighed at the deeply moving friendship of [Huo An] and others.
