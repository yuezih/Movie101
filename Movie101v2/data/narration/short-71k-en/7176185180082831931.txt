0:3:16|0:3:21|In the restaurant, the nouveau riche took off his coat and sat across from [Zuo Xiaoxin], who stood aside, avoiding him with disdain.
0:3:32|0:3:33|[Zuo Xiaoxin] looked at him in disbelief.
0:4:22|0:4:42|After saying that, [Zuo Xiaoxin] turned around without looking back. By this time, the dusk had already faded away, and the night was gradually falling. The corner bar on the street was shining brightly with neon lights.
0:4:42|0:4:47|Zhang Yi leaned against the sofa drinking, but his eyes were fixed on the beauty sitting by the handrail on the second floor.
0:4:54|0:4:58|This is Zuo Xiaoxin noticing him on TV.
0:5:22|0:5:30|Cha Yi sat across from the beauty.
0:5:30|0:5:34|In the end, [Cha Yi] crooked his finger, and the beauty turned arrogantly to the side to listen.
0:5:34|0:5:37|[Cha Yi] quickly stood up and leaned in to whisper in her ear.
0:5:51|0:5:54|The young man stood anxiously next to the beauty and said.
0:5:56|0:6:5|The young man widened his eyes in disbelief, looking at the two of them. Zuo Xiaoxin shrugged and reached out his hand to the beauty.
0:6:5|0:6:10|Downstairs, the two good brothers, [Zuo Xiaoxin] and [Cha Yi], admired each other greatly, then packed up and went to fulfill their promise.
0:6:36|0:6:44|Hey, [Zuo Xiaoxin] pulled Xie Dongping outside, and when they reached a place with no one around, she turned her back to Xie Dongping and said.
0:7:9|0:7:11|[Zuo Xiaoxin] released his hand when he remained silent, and said disappointedly.
0:7:12|0:7:12|[Zuo Xiaoxin] saw no response coming and turned around to give him a slap.
0:7:34|0:7:51|After Xie Dongping finished speaking and left, [Zuo Xiaoxin] looked at his back in confusion. On the other side, the eerie night scene of the bar made people's eyes blurred. In the middle of the dance floor, a seductive girl twisted her body wildly to the deafening music, her fair skin particularly eye-catching.
0:7:51|0:7:57|Cha Yi sat in the corner, staring straight at the enchanting girl in the middle of the dance floor, while his good buddy Zuo Xiaoxin was speechless.
0:8:0|0:8:5|After speaking, Cha Yi smiled smugly, and the two good brothers nodded in approval. Suddenly, Thirteen's phone rang.
0:9:5|0:9:21|In his thirties, a tough guy who goes after what he wants. Soon after, [Cha Yi] picked up his glass and headed towards the dance floor, leaving his two buddies staring in disbelief at his back. As the enchanting young woman stopped in front of him, he stared straight at her legs and said.
0:9:27|0:9:30|The charming girl remained unmoved, continuing to show off her figure.
0:9:30|0:9:33|On the other side, on the bridge.
0:11:14|0:11:16|At this moment, the young man opposite only listened to Dan Qi.
0:11:40|0:11:46|Finally, [Zuo Xiaoxin] deliberately fed food to Danqi, causing Danqi to feel a moment of emotional turmoil.
0:11:46|0:11:51|Suddenly, [Zuo Xiaoxin] slapped her on the buttocks, causing both of them to startle and the young man to flee in panic.
0:14:13|0:14:21|[Zuo Xiaoxin] said disdainfully, then picked up the milk on the side and started drinking it, looking at [Cha Yi] on the stage, while everyone kept dancing along with the music.
0:15:46|0:15:53|[Zuo Xiaoxin] looked at them with a determined expression, and finally, they walked over with measured steps.
0:15:53|0:15:59|[Zuo Xiaoxin] remains unmoved, with sharp eyes fixed on them. The leader, [Cha Yi], locks eyes with her, while she reaches into his pocket with her left hand.
0:15:59|0:16:6|Zuo Xiaoxin and Cha Yi walked side by side, showing off their charm as they walked and striking what they thought was the coolest pose.
0:16:6|0:16:12|Zuo Xiaoxin slowly stood up, and after Cha Yi stopped in his tracks, he smiled at him.
0:16:18|0:16:23|[Zuo Xiaoxin] looked puzzled, but Cha Yi didn't give her a chance to react. He turned around and walked towards the other empty space.
0:16:23|0:16:29|Bai Xuejian [Zuo Xiaoxin] stood still in a daze, then Cha Yi reminded her.
0:16:29|0:16:33|[Zuo Xiaoxin] pretended to casually turn around and sit down.
0:16:33|0:16:40|At this moment, Thirteen called the waiter to bring wine. The waiter handed over a wine tray, and Thirteen took it and handed it directly to Cha Yi.
0:16:40|0:16:42|Cha Yi sniffed it at the tip of his nose.
0:16:43|0:16:43|On the paper.
0:16:59|0:17:2|Suddenly, the two of them seemed to be in the desert.
0:17:2|0:17:6|They knelt on a flat ground, dressed in samurai attire, each holding a long sword.
0:17:6|0:17:12|Zuo Xiaoxin stared intently into the pupils of [Cha Yi], and his eyes involuntarily narrowed slightly, with a glint of spiritual power flashing in the depths.
0:17:12|0:17:14|Cha Yi, nervous, sweats profusely from his forehead and feet.
0:17:39|0:17:48|Zuo Xiaoxin cut her arm, and then Cha Yi placed the long knife between the two pieces.
0:17:48|0:17:52|He was struck in the groin with the handle of the knife, the intense pain causing him to collapse to the ground.
0:18:3|0:18:11|On the other side, Zuo Xiaoxin used a knife to support her body, struggling to get up and walk to Cha Yi's side.
0:18:11|0:18:15|Zuo Xiaoxin, with a smug smile on her face, brought her thoughts back to reality.
0:18:15|0:18:17|[Cha Yi] raised his hand and stopped the massage for a moment.
0:18:33|0:18:45|Following that, the two best friends squeezed mustard into the red wine.
0:18:45|0:18:54|Drunk Xie Dongping snatched the wine glass from Zuo Xiaoxin's hand and drank it all, while the people around him looked at him menacingly.
0:19:4|0:19:6|Bai Xue poured another glass of wine and placed it in front of [Cha Yi].
0:19:6|0:19:9|[Zuo Xiaoxin] propped up her face with one hand, provocatively staring at [Cha Yi].
0:19:9|0:19:19|Shortly after, she picked up the wine glass and took a big sip through the straw.
0:19:32|0:19:49|Tears silently streamed down [Cha Yi]'s face at this moment.
0:19:58|0:20:2|As Cha Yi looked up at Zuo Xiaoxin, he saw her unbuttoning the buttons on her chest.
0:20:8|0:20:21|The seemingly simple action was alluring in Cha Yi's eyes. The brother's clothes made Zuo Xiaoxin's originally fair skin appear even more delicate. His fingers casually brushed over his lips, sexy and seductive.
0:20:21|0:20:29|The other four made success gestures on the side, then the two arrived at the Bird's Nest themed hotel, with Zuo Xiaoxin following closely behind, using her foot to close the door.
0:20:35|0:20:42|Suddenly, Zuo Xiaoxin pushed Cha Yi onto the bed, quickly straddling him and then kneeling to take off his jacket.
0:20:46|0:20:51|At the same time, Zuo Xiaoxin and Cha Yi were lying on the door, competing to eavesdrop.
0:20:51|0:20:54|Zuo Xiaoxin jumps and lands directly on Cha Yi's back.
0:20:54|0:20:58|In the room, Zuo Xiaoxin forcefully pulls off Cha Yi's shirt, urgently buttoning up his shirt buttons.
0:20:58|0:21:4|Cha Yi stared at him with a lecherous look on his face, and then he pushed his head down and continued with his actions.
0:21:5|0:21:12|At this moment, Cha Yi reached out to unbutton his shirt, but Zuo Xiaoxin objected and placed his hand aside, as did the other hand.
0:21:15|0:21:19|Soon after, he flipped over and pinned [Zuo Xiaoxin] underneath him.
0:21:19|0:21:27|When he tried to unbutton the buttons on [Zuo Xiaoxin]'s chest, he was pushed away by [Zuo Xiaoxin]. Cha Yi couldn't suppress the heat in his heart, and his lips trembled as he looked at her.
0:21:28|0:21:30|She immediately turned her head to one side, constantly dodging and standing.
0:21:30|0:21:36|So, Zhang Yi turned towards her neck, and [Zuo Xiaoxin] slowly accepted her kiss at this moment.
0:21:36|0:21:48|Suddenly, [Zhang Yi] sat up straight and took off her shirt, relentlessly attacking her most vulnerable spot.
0:21:48|0:21:54|The best friend eavesdropped outside, gleefully listening in as the battle inside intensified, with the crystal chandelier casting a bewitching glow.
0:22:8|0:22:12|After the two finished the battle, [Zuo Xiaoxin] immediately did a handstand in the corner.
0:23:5|0:23:8|He immediately picked up things, still cursing [Zuo Xiaoxin] in his mouth.
0:23:13|0:23:20|At this moment, a lively sperm appears on the screen, and he suddenly sees four sperm harassing a young and beautiful egg cell.
0:23:20|0:23:23|So, he bravely stepped forward and drove away the sperm for the egg cell.
0:23:23|0:23:31|The egg cell, favored and surprised, was instantly attracted to him, and the two successfully combined. With the push of the chromosomes, the embryo gradually took shape.
0:23:31|0:23:35|As time passed, the little baby was also born smoothly, one year and nine months later.
0:24:11|0:24:19|On the other side, at the Beijing and Meifeng Hospital.
0:24:19|0:24:24|[Zuo Xiaoxin] was about to stand up with the child in her arms, but suddenly felt dizzy and immediately grabbed onto the chair.
0:25:17|0:25:26|Zuo Xiaoxin and Cha Yi, who were eavesdropping, suddenly realized that a group of people had arrived behind them.
0:25:26|0:25:27|At this moment, Cha Yi and the beauty walked out.
0:25:53|0:25:56|On the other side, [Zuo Xiaoxin] is working hard to scrub the oil stains on the stove.
0:27:26|0:27:28|[Xie Dongping] is busy working alone in the kitchen.
0:29:26|0:29:27|The three brothers are walking on the overpass.
0:29:27|0:29:29|Zuo Xiaoxin reluctantly lowered her head and continued to follow behind.
0:30:11|0:30:18|Suddenly, the scene cuts back to the night when Zuo Xiaoxin and Cha Yi first met, their chests pressed tightly against each other, feeling the rise and fall of each other's breath.
0:30:18|0:30:23|When the emotions ran deep, [Zuo Xiaoxin] tore down the last defense line between the two.
0:30:23|0:30:28|At that moment, the sound of the boiling kettle brought [Zuo Xiaoxin] back to reality, and he tried to calm his emotions.
0:30:29|0:30:36|Immediately, he closed the valve, picked up the water bottle, made formula milk for the baby, and even tested the temperature of the milk with his wrist.
0:30:36|0:30:43|At the same time, [Cha Yi] also came up according to the information of the room number. Cautiously, he opened his phone to record before knocking on the door.
0:31:3|0:31:12|Without waiting for him to finish speaking, he walked past [Zuo Xiaoxin] and into the room. As he looked around, [Zuo Xiaoxin] had already placed the slippers at his feet.
0:31:12|0:31:22|Cha Yi bent down, changing his shoes leisurely, while at this moment, [Zuo Xiaoxin] gazed at his figure absentmindedly. Just as Cha Yi stood up, he immediately turned around to conceal himself.
0:31:30|0:31:35|Cha Yi reluctantly lowered his head and followed [Zuo Xiaoxin] to a door.
0:31:35|0:31:46|[Zuo Xiaoxin] gently pushed open the door, but when [Cha Yi] saw the child in the crib clearly, she immediately dropped her carefree demeanor.
0:31:46|0:31:50|He walked slowly towards the crib, his eyes fixed on the baby inside.
0:31:50|0:31:52|At this moment, the child also showed him a innocent smile.
0:31:56|0:32:2|Cha Yi gently lifts the gauze curtain in front of the baby crib and carefully observes the child.
0:32:2|0:32:11|At this moment, the child reached out to Cha Yi, while Zuo Xiaoxin, who was standing beside them, watched this scene with mixed emotions, unsure if what he was doing was right.
0:32:11|0:32:15|Soon after, [Cha Yi] lifted the child over his head with both hands.
0:32:25|0:32:31|When Cha Yi held the child in his arms, the heartwarming scene unexpectedly triggered an illusion for [Zuo Xiaoxin].
0:32:31|0:32:38|At this moment, [Cha Yi] is wearing a cloak, cradling the child in her arms, looking at the child who is already fast asleep with a comforting expression.
0:32:38|0:32:50|At first, she exuded the radiance of paternal love as a new father. [Zuo Xiaoxin] sat on the side, hands crossed, watching them. At this moment, her eyes were filled with tears of excitement, hoping that all of this could become reality.
0:32:51|0:33:6|While he was immersed in this beautiful and heartwarming scene, the clock hanging on the wall suddenly made a sound.
0:33:6|0:33:12|The sound of the bell brought him back to reality. After he adjusted his emotions, he immediately walked forward and took the child from Zuo Xiaoxin's arms.
0:35:17|0:35:23|Cha Yi climbed up the wall by stepping on Zuo Xiaoxin's shoulders.
0:36:19|0:36:28|Zuo Xiaoxin saw through Zai's attempt to escape when he hurriedly took off his glasses. He quickly checked on the child, only to find out that the child had just lost a wet diaper.
0:36:28|0:36:32|Outside the wall, Zuo Xiaoxin just removed the diaper that was stuck on his face, and then Cha Yi pressed another one on him.
0:36:52|0:36:54|Tianxuan, strong desire for revenge.
0:37:10|0:37:11|[Zuo Xiaoxin] has a best friend named Danqi.
0:37:27|0:37:33|Danqi, exuding feminine charm all over her body, completely captivated Zuo Xiaoxin, who didn't listen to a word she said.
0:37:47|0:37:49|Danqi looked at Er Tiao in disbelief, while on the other side, [Zuo Xiaoxin] sat in the car and answered the phone.
0:38:33|0:38:36|Putting down her phone, [Zuo Xiaoxin] leaned directly on the steering wheel.
0:38:36|0:38:39|She is exhausted, not knowing what to do.
0:38:39|0:38:45|Later, she slowly raised her head to look outside the car window, only to see the words "Bird's Nest Theme Hotel" looming in front of her.
0:39:8|0:39:11|This is Zuo Xiaoxin and Cha Yi secretly changing cards at the bottom of the pearl.
0:39:27|0:39:31|[Cha Yi] turned his head slowly and said calmly.
0:40:2|0:40:8|Zuo Xiaoxin, Cha Yi, and a beautiful woman in nurse uniform sat on an electric scooter together, and the woman stood up slowly.
0:40:8|0:40:9|The beauty turned around, it was [Cha Yi].
0:40:32|0:40:46|The curly-haired man stuck the toothpick in his mouth onto the needle held by his son.
0:42:50|0:42:57|The next day, [Zhang Yi] arrived at the door with a bouquet of flowers.
0:43:44|0:43:48|In the end, [Cha Yi] led both of his good brothers to participate.
0:43:48|0:43:54|Zuo Xiaoxin and Cha Yi danced to the music in the living room, while Zai sat in the corner comforting the child.
0:43:54|0:43:59|Before long, the two good brothers were preparing food for everyone in the kitchen.
0:44:3|0:44:6|Putting an egg in there, the protein will coagulate rapidly.
0:44:50|0:45:0|Just as everyone was enjoying themselves, [Zuo Xiaoxin] walked in through the door.
0:45:8|0:45:22|[Zuo Xiaoxin] directly hands the child over to the mother.
0:45:22|0:45:30|[Zuo Xiaoxin] threatened Zha Yi with a cane, but just as Zha Yi was about to fall, he accidentally knocked over a box on the table, which had "loosely" written on it.
0:45:30|0:45:33|He suddenly realized something and turned to look at the people in the living room.
0:45:37|0:45:41|Cha Yi covered his mouth and walked out of the room, with Zuo Xiaoxin and the two good brothers following closely behind.
0:45:41|0:45:43|Suddenly, the mahjong tile with the image of a female duck appears on the screen.
0:47:53|0:47:57|Finally, Zuo Xiaoxin and Cha Yi were driving on the road in the second car, when suddenly Cha Yi's phone rang.
0:48:11|0:48:15|[Cha Yi], sitting in the middle of the restaurant, hung up the phone expressionlessly.
0:48:15|0:48:17|Not long after, a strange smile appeared at the corner of his mouth.
0:49:20|0:49:24|[Zuo Xiaoxin] walked into the restaurant.
0:49:43|0:49:51|After [Zuo Xiaoxin] sat down, Zhang Yi took out the package behind him and pushed it in front of him.
0:49:51|0:49:58|He opened the package, inside was a gun holster, and then he took out a wooden handmade pistol.
0:49:58|0:50:1|[Zuo Xiaoxin] quickly rewrapped the package and put it back into the bag.
0:50:9|0:50:13|[Zuo Xiaoxin] turned and left, while [Cha Yi] saw that the men were unmoved and anxiously slapped the bald man.
0:51:24|0:51:33|In a daze, the younger brothers were knocked down, and then Zuo Xiaoxin was seen fixing her hair and walking towards the bald head.
0:51:46|0:51:53|Cha Yi, who was begging for mercy on the ground, caught a glimpse of the bald man escaping. He slowly lifted his head and turned, half lying on the ground.
0:51:53|0:51:57|At the same time, [Zuo Xiaoxin] walked towards him and reached out her right hand.
0:51:57|0:52:2|At this moment, in Cha Yi's eyes, [Zuo Xiaoxin] is shining all over, like a savior.
0:52:2|0:52:6|He instinctively reached out his hand and, with the help of [Cha Yi], stood up.
0:52:6|0:52:10|Later, [Zuo Xiaoxin] put his arm around his shoulder and they walked out together.
0:53:21|0:53:25|After speaking, all the workers on the scene immediately turned and left.
0:53:25|0:53:29|[Zuo Xiaoxin] impatiently placed the helmet aside and looked at the design drawings on the table.
0:54:22|0:54:24|The staff standing at the edge of the building all gave thumbs up.
0:54:37|0:54:42|At the construction site, a vast open space with hundreds of construction machinery operating intensively.
0:54:42|0:54:47|The deafening roar of machinery fills the air as construction workers continue to work at great heights.
0:54:47|0:55:1|At this moment, [Cha Yi] was curled up in a corner of the elevator, gasping for breath heavily.
0:55:1|0:55:3|Before long, the elevator reached the top floor.
0:55:18|0:55:23|[Zuo Xiaoxin] walked leisurely by the alley with his hands in his pockets.
0:55:23|0:55:25|[Cha Yi], who was kneeling on the ground, immediately let go of the pillar.
0:55:32|0:55:36|Cha Yi walked along the inside of the aisle, reaching out to the wall to catch up with Zuo Xiaoxin.
0:55:37|0:55:43|Following that, Zuo Xiaoxin opened the lunchbox in his hand, with neatly arranged dishes that whet his appetite.
0:55:46|0:55:54|Cha Yi used a fork to bring the food to his mouth, but he disdainfully snatched the fork and walked to the other side, simply sitting on the steps.
0:55:54|0:55:56|Cha Yi spoke up at this moment.
0:56:1|0:56:8|Zhang Yiben wanted to sit next to her, but her eyes accidentally looked downstairs, scaring her into running back immediately.
0:57:7|0:57:11|At this moment, a middle-aged man upstairs warmly greeted Zuo Xiaoxin.
0:57:31|0:57:33|Zhang Yi approached Zuo Xiaoxin and sniffed back and forth with his nose for diagnosis.
0:57:37|0:57:41|[Zuo Xiaoxin] looked at him helplessly, then turned and walked away.
0:59:7|0:59:11|After Xie Dongping finished singing, he casually picked up the flowers placed aside, turned around, and knelt down on one knee in front of [Zuo Xiaoxin].
0:59:17|0:59:23|On the other side, [Cha Yi] pushed open the door of the bathroom.
0:59:23|0:59:28|Xie Dongping, who was in the bathroom, turned around and saw [Cha Yi] showing off while holding a ring.
1:0:16|1:0:19|[Zuo Xiaoxin] helped up Zha Yi lying on the ground and said.
1:0:25|1:0:31|Xie Dongping quietly picked up the ring from the ground, pinching and scratching me.
1:0:38|1:0:40|Cha Yi looked around with a blank expression on his face and said.
1:1:47|1:1:57|[Zuo Xiaoxin] shyly covered her ears and ran to the side, but when she turned to look at Cha Yi, the two of them rode their bikes over, and Cha Yi instinctively grabbed her hand and pulled her back.
1:1:57|1:2:9|The sudden move, however, made [Zuo Xiaoxin] feel her heart racing. She stared at him intently, and just as she was about to give in, [Zuo Xiaoxin] slowly withdrew her hand and then turned away.
1:2:9|1:2:16|Cha Yi immediately chased after him, then reached out and pulled him back, the two of them walked down the road with secret joy in their hearts.
1:2:16|1:2:23|After an unknown amount of time, the two of them continued to walk forward shoulder to shoulder, with the shy [Zuo Xiaoxin], who was in love for the first time, lowering her head.
1:2:23|1:2:28|Suddenly, the sound of the clock above the square rang out, and the two of them stopped in their tracks and looked at each other.
1:2:29|1:2:47|[Zhang] stared straight at himself, [Zuo Xiaoxin] shyly lowered her head, but when he looked up again, he saw the brightly lit Bird's Nest themed hotel where the two had first met that night, which stood out especially in the night. In [Zuo Xiaoxin]'s mind, scenes of the two sweetly intertwined at that moment emerged.
1:2:47|1:2:57|[Zhang] noticed his abnormality, and as he followed his gaze, at that moment, [Zuo Xiaoxin] suddenly averted her eyes, blushing shyly as she ran forward, [Zhang] immediately followed suit.
1:3:45|1:3:50|At this moment, Cha Yi had already rushed downstairs, tearing off the plank tied to his leg as he ran.
1:3:50|1:3:52|[Zuo Xiaoxin] also quickly caught up with him.
1:3:56|1:4:2|Cha Yi ran forward with all his might, at this moment, he didn't care about the injuries on his body, his only concern was the safety of his son.
1:4:2|1:4:4|[Zuo Xiaoxin] has practiced Taekwondo before.
1:4:4|1:4:11|But not as physically strong as Cha Yi, Zuo Xiaoxin was panting heavily, but dared not stop, only dragging his exhausted body forward.
1:4:11|1:4:18|At this moment, a taxi slowly stopped at the intersection, and Zuo Xiaoxin stumbled to the driver's window.
1:4:25|1:4:38|Finally, Cha Yi opened the rear car door, and the child was lying safely inside.
1:4:38|1:4:46|[Zuo Xiaoxin] kept kissing the child, then the two walked home. Suddenly, [Zuo Xiaoxin] looked at Cha Yi's injured leg and asked with a skeptical expression.
1:5:28|1:5:33|Zhang Yishuang failed miserably, sat on the ground with a sigh, and [Zuo Xiaoxin] was speechless.
1:5:49|1:6:1|Later, as the vast staircase came into view, Cha Yi, with his bicycle, stood in the middle. He nervously swallowed and turned to Zuo Xiaoxin for reassurance, only to be met with a mocking expression on Zuo Xiaoxin's face.
1:6:1|1:6:9|Continuing, he bravely accelerated the car towards the stairs, but just as he was about to reach the staircase, he urgently hit the brakes with his foot.
1:6:9|1:6:16|It is obvious that this result is within the expectations of [Zuo Xiaoxin]. He stands up straight, looking disdainfully at Cha Yi, while Cha Yi speaks calmly and unhurriedly.
1:6:29|1:6:46|Cha Yi picked up the bicycle and caught up. As night fell, rows of street lights illuminated the darkness, accompanied by the cool night breeze. [Zuo Xiaoxin] and Cha Yi stood in front of the window of the children's room, looking up at the starry sky. Their figures appeared particularly slender against the backdrop of the night. At this moment, Cha Yi spoke first.
1:7:20|1:7:27|On the rooftop, with the colors and the stairs, you... see [Zuo Xiaoxin] looking so serious, Cha Yi gazes at her with a face full of affection.
1:7:27|1:7:32|Then, she placed her hands on [Zuo Xiaoxin]'s shoulders and kissed her without hesitation.
1:7:32|1:7:37|At this moment, [Zuo Xiaoxin] calmly faces her inner self, closing her eyes to feel his kiss.
1:7:37|1:7:42|With the camera zooming out, two aliens were seen holding a telescope and looking at them.
1:7:42|1:7:46|Seeing the two of them finally getting together, they gradually put down their binoculars and looked at each other.
1:7:46|1:7:51|Following that, the female alien gently touched the other's face with one hand, then passionately kissed them. 
1:7:52|1:8:7|At this moment, it seems like the world has become beautiful. The best part is that after time passes, the old people, old things, and even the old feelings that you truly love are still there. Things that can last must have weight, and they can withstand the repeated erosion and washing of time.
1:9:28|1:9:35|Okay, I'll go set up the camera. The next day, Zhang arrived early at the Bird's Nest Theme Hotel.
1:9:42|1:9:46|At this moment, [Zuo Xiaoxin] leisurely walked in.
1:10:33|1:10:44|On the other side, [Zuo Xiaoxin] and [Cha Yi] were tightly embracing each other, but [Cha Yi] showed no passion at all. His eyes scanned the ceiling, searching for hidden cameras.
1:10:44|1:10:52|Thirteen computer screens showed the figures of [Zuo Xiaoxin] and [Cha Yi], sparking instant interest.
1:10:52|1:10:56|He took a big sip of freshly brewed milk tea, but it was so hot that it made him grimace.
1:10:59|1:11:3|They then reluctantly moved towards the bathroom.
1:11:3|1:11:13|In front of the computer, [Zuo Xiaoxin] and [Cha Yi] had already prepared tissues. [Zuo Xiaoxin] took off his pants, sat on the stool, closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and tried to adjust his eager mood to watch.
1:11:13|1:11:22|At this moment, [Cha Yi] in the room was extremely anxious, hesitating on the edge of moral boundaries, and ultimately he extinguished his competitiveness.
1:11:26|1:11:34|While Zuo Xiaoxin was checking the computer, she accidentally knocked over the milk tea cup.
1:12:5|1:12:16|Zhang Yi turned around and pinned [Zuo Xiaoxin] down. On the other side, Danqi took out her phone and looked incredulously at the two, while the two who realized they had said the wrong thing kept avoiding Danqi's gaze.
1:12:26|1:12:34|After speaking, [Zuo Xiaoxin] turned around, picked up her bag, took out her phone from it, while [Cha Yi], who was unaware, continued to kiss every inch of her skin.
1:12:34|1:12:40|When [Zuo Xiaoxin] saw the message, the smile on her face instantly froze.
1:12:40|1:12:46|Later, [Cha Yi] casually looked up and also noticed the message displayed on the phone.
1:12:46|1:12:51|[Zuo Xiaoxin] pushed [Cha Yi] aside, looked up and searched, suddenly, she found the camera hidden in the ventilation duct.
1:13:7|1:13:14|Zhang Yi was beaten to the ground, howling in pain.
1:13:14|1:13:20|At the same time, Zuo Xiaoxin, in order to chase Danqi, hastily climbed over the fence, but ended up hanging himself on it, causing serious injury to his private parts.
1:13:24|1:13:30|In the hospital restroom, the three brothers stood in a row with blue expressions on their faces, using the toilet.
1:13:55|1:13:59|Upon returning home, Cha Yi immediately took out his phone and dialed Zuo Xiaoxin's number.
1:14:8|1:14:18|At this moment, [Zuo Xiaoxin] is standing by the window lost in thought. She stares at her phone as it rings, then decisively opens her contacts, finds Cha Yi, and deletes the contact.
1:14:18|1:14:26|Back home, [Zuo Xiaoxin] took out the box left by her father, which contained a photo of her father and a wooden-carved gun.
1:14:26|1:14:33|Following that, she opened the cloth bag in front of her, revealing a collection of tools used for carving. She then picked up one of them and wiped it clean with a piece of cloth.
1:14:35|1:14:39|On the other side, after careful consideration, [Cha Yi] decided to turn over a new leaf.
1:14:39|1:14:44|Sitting on the sofa, [Zuo Xiaoxin] fed each photo in his hand into the shredder one by one.
1:14:44|1:14:48|He bid farewell to the past in this way, wanting to start all over again.
1:14:48|1:14:53|In fact, his heart had already changed towards [Zuo Xiaoxin] at this moment.
1:14:53|1:14:58|He just kept hurting the fragile heart of [Zuo Xiaoxin].
1:14:58|1:15:2|He then flipped through the photo album on his phone, reminiscing about this wonderful time.
1:15:17|1:15:25|At this moment, [Cha Yi] was once again deeply moved. Later, he arrived fully armed outside the home of [Zuo Xiaoxin].
1:15:25|1:15:29|[Zuo Xiaoxin] saw that the person coming in was [Cha Yi], and angrily closed the door.
1:15:29|1:15:37|So, [Cha Yi] rang the doorbell again, but [Zuo Xiaoxin] had placed the power cord on the doorbell, and a powerful electric current hit his body through the doorbell.
1:15:37|1:15:41|Seeing [Zuo Xiaoxin] so determined, the persistent [Cha Yi] turned to look for Danqi.
1:15:45|1:15:52|Following that, he went to find another close girlfriend, Bai Xue.
1:16:37|1:16:41|The three of them chatted without the slightest regard for the grandfather playing on the tablet nearby.
1:16:41|1:16:44|Although Grandpa suffers from senile dementia, his memory is astonishing.
1:17:6|1:17:11|Returning home in the evening, he found his son reading in the study and mysteriously said to him.
1:17:44|1:17:52|Zuo Xiaoxin carries the nursing bag and goes to the groom's house for a formal meeting.
1:19:11|1:19:14|Upon hearing this, [Cha Yi] lowered his head and fell into deep thought.
1:19:17|1:19:18|Recently.
1:19:22|1:19:24|In order to gain custody of the child.
1:19:24|1:19:27|The female lawyer refuted the plaintiff's claim that the relationship was consensual.
1:20:27|1:20:31|The future education and growth environment of these children are also factors to consider.
1:21:18|1:21:27|[Zuo Xiaoxin] immediately stopped what she was doing, shook her head without hesitation, and then escorted her mother to the door of the room.
1:21:36|1:21:43|[Zuo Xiaoxin] looked at Zuo Mu in disbelief. She never expected to be so important in her mother's heart.
1:21:43|1:21:50|[Zuo Xiaoxin]'s mother lovingly stroked her daughter's hair, feeling guilty for seeing her daughter living such a hard life.
1:21:50|1:21:52|To avoid being overly sentimental, she said with a smile.
1:23:14|1:23:19|Late at night, unable to let go of [Zuo Xiaoxin], Zha Yi walked with heavy steps to the children's room.
1:23:19|1:23:23|She knelt by the bed, gazing affectionately at the loose clothes in her hands.
1:23:23|1:23:27|Zuo Xiaoxin, with a heart full of longing, lay on the bed and shed tears of sadness.
1:23:27|1:23:33|Unknowingly, she fell into a deep sleep.
1:24:10|1:24:13|[Zuo Xiaoxin] arrived at the door of Cha Yi's house, holding a kitchen knife.
1:24:52|1:25:2|Cha Yi's family fled in a panic, leaving only the grandfather playing games in the living room.
1:25:2|1:25:8|Zuo Xiaoxin, filled with anger, kicked open the door, and Zhang's mother ran out from the back door holding the child.
1:25:8|1:25:12|Zha Fu and [Cha Yi] followed closely behind, running and looking back.
1:25:31|1:25:33|[Zuo Xiaoxin] is holding a knife, ready to go upstairs.
1:25:33|1:25:37|Zuo Xiaoxin immediately raised the knife in front of his chest and walked towards his grandfather.
1:26:21|1:26:27|Zhang Yi looked panic-stricken towards the door, while [Cha Yi], who stayed behind, avoided his gaze.
1:26:55|1:27:0|The next day, Danqi took Zuo Xiaoxin to Cha's house, only to see the maid packing things up.
1:27:39|1:27:43|Soon after, the plane landed in Okinawa.
1:27:43|1:27:50|At that moment, [Cha Yi], who was taking a walk on the beach, received a message that his grandfather had been tied to a pillar.
1:27:50|1:27:52|Immediately after, [Cha Yi] angrily threw his phone.
1:28:8|1:28:12|In the restaurant on the other side, three Japanese geishas are performing a traditional tune.
1:29:29|1:29:33|Suddenly, the phone rang, and the four of them gathered closely to check the message.
1:29:33|1:29:38|The screen shows that an hour later, the Ocean Park ship agrees to exchange positions with the neighboring ship.
1:29:38|1:29:44|In the end, as agreed, the two arrived, but when Zuo Xiaoxin was about to check on the child, [Cha Yi] refused to let go.
1:29:54|1:29:57|Zuo Xiaoxin is on the phone, blocked at the front door of the house.
1:29:59|1:30:5|[Cha Yi] frowned, feeling the tense atmosphere. He originally wanted to turn around and leave, but then turned back.
1:31:20|1:31:23|Angry [Zuo Xiaoxin] pushed [Cha Yi] away and walked off.
1:31:23|1:31:26|She felt more and more aggrieved, and the anger in her heart was hard to suppress.
1:31:31|1:31:36|[Cha Yi] stared at her, his brows furrowed, every word she said piercing deeply into his heart.
1:31:36|1:31:40|Zuo Xiaoxin then looked around, searching for the child's figure.
1:31:40|1:31:44|Without receiving any response, [Zuo Xiaoxin] instantly panicked.
1:31:44|1:31:48|At this moment, [Cha Yi] also realized the seriousness of the problem and quickly turned back to search.
1:31:49|1:31:56|On the other side, Grandpa is taking Song Song to visit the Ocean Park. The photography enthusiast Grandpa is always ready to capture moments with his camera.
1:32:1|1:32:4|[Zuo Xiaoxin] is extremely anxious, just like ants on a hot pan.
1:32:4|1:32:9|He ran through every corner of the park, carefully searching for [Cha Yi]'s figure.
1:32:9|1:32:12|Zhang Yize followed behind him with an annoyed expression.
1:32:12|1:32:16|When they arrived at the ocean park, Grandpa had already left with [Cha Yi].
1:32:16|1:32:18|Zhang Yi searched in vain and then sought help from others.
1:32:38|1:32:42|[Zuo Xiaoxin] walked desolately on the steps of the aquarium, but she did not give up.
1:33:0|1:33:5|[Cha Yi] wanted to pull [Zuo Xiaoxin], who was sitting on a rock, but she shook him off.
1:33:5|1:33:7|Now, he has long held a deep hatred towards [Cha Yi].
1:33:7|1:33:11|At this moment, the local military and civilians are holding some kind of ceremony.
1:33:11|1:33:18|Many people dressed in local costumes walk and dance on the streets, with many tourists gathered on both sides of the road to watch.
1:33:18|1:33:21|Cha Yi and Zuo Xiaoxin saw the situation and immediately ran over.
1:33:34|1:33:38|On the other side, the drumming team happened to pass by [Grandpa] and [Song Song].
1:33:38|1:33:43|[Grandfather] curiously picked up the camera and took a snapshot, only to see the baby carriage slowly sliding towards the stairs.
1:33:43|1:33:51|At this moment, [Cha Yi] also spotted the figure of [Grandpa].
1:33:51|1:33:56|[Grandpa] turned around to say hello, but his backpack accidentally pushed the stroller down the stairs.
1:33:56|1:33:59|[Cha Yi] saw the situation and ran towards [Zhang Yi] who was playing with a bicycle on the side.
1:34:5|1:34:10|[Zhang Yi] rode his bike straight towards the stairs, leaving the young man behind chasing after him.
1:34:15|1:34:19|However, when the young man ran to the stairs, he realized that [Cha Yi] was actually going to save the child.
1:34:20|1:34:26|When [Cha Yi] rode to the last step, he turned the car around and accelerated to ensure the safety of the child.
1:34:26|1:34:29|He rushed down without hesitation.
1:34:29|1:34:33|[Zuo Xiaoxin] followed closely behind, descending the stairs at the fastest speed.
1:34:33|1:34:38|Suddenly, the landing point of the bicycle was relatively high, and both the person and the bike fell out directly.
1:34:38|1:34:41|And Cha Yi, in the process of tumbling, also collided with the guardrail.
1:34:41|1:34:44|Soon after, the local military and civilians could be heard shouting loudly:
1:34:47|1:34:55|In a hurry, [Zuo Xiaoxin] took two steps at a time, but suddenly Zhang Yi reached the ground before the baby carriage, which was speeding up instead of slowing down.
1:34:58|1:35:3|Cha Yi rolled over in a daze, but Zuo Xiaoxin's words instantly woke him up.
1:35:3|1:35:12|He looked at the baby carriage and slowly got up. Just as the van was about to hit the baby carriage, he ran towards it at full speed and grabbed it.
1:35:12|1:35:18|[Zuo Xiaoxin]'s legs also lost strength in an instant, collapsing on the ground, while the arriving parents of [Cha Yi] covered their eyes in shock.
1:36:41|1:36:46|Cha Yi simply pulled Cha's mother back, with [Zuo Xiaoxin] leading his grandfather following behind them.
1:36:46|1:36:53|[Zuo Xiaoxin] held the child with tears in his eyes, watching their backs with a heavy heart, feeling no joy in taking the child back.
1:36:53|1:36:55|The next day, [Cha Yi]'s family was ready to leave.
1:36:56|1:37:4|[Cha Yi] is helped by the waiter to load the luggage of different sizes into the trunk of the taxi, and the waiter bows to him before closing the car door.
1:37:6|1:37:14|On the other side, [Zuo Xiaoxin] sat by the window, lost in thought while holding the child. Seeing this, Danqi was about to go comfort her, but was stopped by Er Tiao.
1:37:14|1:37:22|Er Tiao looked at him and shook his head, Dan Qi also understood immediately, then retreated behind the curtain. Sitting in the taxi, [Cha Yi] stared blankly out the window.
1:37:38|1:37:44|Grandpa seemed to be singing [Cha Yi]'s inner thoughts at this moment. [Cha Yi] withdrew his gaze and looked at Grandpa, then lowered his head.
1:37:44|1:37:47|Before long, [Cha Yi]'s family all arrived at the airport.
1:37:47|1:37:52|They passed through security smoothly, stored their luggage, and the father handed each suitcase to the service staff one by one.
1:37:52|1:37:58|The others stood aside waiting, while another staff member completed the procedures for the passengers and politely said.
1:38:0|1:38:3|Suddenly, [Zuo Xiaoxin] appeared at the entrance of the airport.
1:38:4|1:38:9|He looked up at the flight information on the screen, then looked around, searching for their figures.
1:38:9|1:38:14|And at this moment, they had already entered the ticket checkpoint, and he hurriedly ran towards the registration desk to inquire.
1:38:19|1:38:23|The service staff did not understand what she was saying, but instead spoke to her.
1:38:25|1:38:29|[Zuo Xiaoxin]'s hope was shattered once again, and she quickly turned around to look for another place.
1:39:26|1:39:48|I reached out my hand desperately for a long time, and then he walked over, passed me, and took the bottle behind me. The tour guide next to me translated every word [Zuo Xiaoxin] said to the tourists, and the female tourists present were amazed, covering their mouths.
1:40:49|1:40:59|[Cha Yi] bent down in sorrow and wept, and at that moment, a pair of hands grabbed his arm. When he looked up, he saw that it was Zuo Xiaoxin.
1:40:59|1:41:4|Cha Yi gently removed the long hair from his forehead and tenderly stroked his head.
1:41:8|1:41:16|In the next second, [Zuo Xiaoxin] tightly hugged him, wishing he could melt into her arms.
1:41:16|1:41:21|The onlookers applauded for them, and the tour guide, with tears in his eyes, definitely did not nod in agreement.
1:41:21|1:41:25|Someone took out a camera and captured this scene.
1:41:25|1:41:27|Zuo Xiaoxin's mother was also moved and said.
1:41:31|1:41:37|Grandpa Zuo Xiaoxin immediately walked up with tears in his eyes, picked up the camera on his chest, and captured this touching scene.
1:41:37|1:41:52|Not knowing how long had passed, [Zuo Xiaoxin] and [Cha Yi] stood before the priest, solemnly answering his questions. Whether in happiness or sorrow, they were willing to give up all others and commit themselves to each other until the end of their lives.
1:41:52|1:41:55|[Cha Yi] looked at [Zuo Xiaoxin] and said confidently.
1:41:57|1:42:5|The priest then turned to ask [Zuo Xiaoxin], "Now I ask you, surrender yourself completely to him, until the end of your life."
1:42:5|1:42:8|[Zuo Xiaoxin] had a happy smile on her face as she said.
1:42:16|1:42:20|Zuo Xiaoxin and Cha Yi then lit the candle in the middle of the candlestick together.
1:42:21|1:42:24|Symbolizing that their lives would be intertwined from now on.
1:42:24|1:42:29|Finally, everyone stood together and took a happy group photo.
1:43:18|1:43:21|They are actually siblings.
1:44:13|1:44:17|Grandpa was shopping, and the shop assistant gestured for him to come this way and said.
1:44:18|1:44:22|Then [Zuo Xiaoxin] picked up the packed bag and escorted grandpa to the store entrance.
1:44:28|1:44:34|Grandpa quickly returned the gesture, bowing repeatedly to the shop assistant until the shop assistant smiled and waved at Grandpa.
