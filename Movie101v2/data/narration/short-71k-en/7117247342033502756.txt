0:1:27|0:1:31|In the sky above the city, a group of white doves flies by, marking the beginning of the film.
0:1:33|0:1:52|Against the backdrop of a building with a flying white dove, a female anchor on the electronic screen is broadcasting the news.
0:1:52|0:1:57|Following a feather floating down, two security guards run out of the building, chasing a thief.
0:2:6|0:2:13|In the middle of the road, five cars are waiting. In the front car, a man in a suit looks serious.
0:2:13|0:2:21|He is [Ou Jian] on the cover of Time Weekly on the electronic screen.
0:2:21|0:2:23|He picked up the phone next to him and put it to his ear.
0:2:26|0:2:32|[Ou Jian] closed his eyes in resignation, his hands resting on the steering wheel.
0:2:32|0:2:44|[Ou Jian] pursed his lips, turned his head away from the phone, blinked, then fiercely threw the phone on the passenger seat. He reached out to loosen his silent tie, opened his hand, pressed his index finger against his brow, and squeezed it hard a few times.
0:2:45|0:2:50|After standing up slightly, [Fei Xin] placed his index finger and thumb on his forehead and pressed down.
0:2:50|0:2:58|Suddenly, he noticed the sound of the horn behind him, raised his head abruptly, and glanced sideways at the traffic light above, which was already showing green.
0:2:58|0:3:4|He quickly shifted gears, but found that he couldn't move the gear lever. He pushed hard twice, but it remained stuck in place.
0:3:4|0:3:11|He repeatedly turned the key, but the car didn't respond for a while. He hit the steering wheel hard, the sense of urgency making sweat beads appear on his face.
0:3:12|0:3:19|Finally, when he turned the key again, the car responded, and the car behind also stopped honking, passing through the intersection one after another.
0:3:21|0:3:40|Ou Jian's car drove to a place under an overpass. As he was about to pass through, a car in front of him suddenly fell straight down. He quickly hit the brakes, crossed his arms to protect his head. Luckily, the falling car flipped over in front of him. With his heart still racing, he lifted his head and looked at the car in front of him, then glanced around.
0:3:40|0:3:47|After getting off the car and closing the door, he looked around while approaching the smoking overturned vehicle, bending down to look inside.
0:3:51|0:3:56|Then he knelt down on one knee, tapped on the car window, only to find that there was no one inside.
0:3:56|0:4:3|Ou Jian stood up, opened his mouth to look around, and after calming down a bit, he looked up at the ring above.
0:4:3|0:4:10|With a furrowed brow and lowered head, a cat was lying on the cement ground next to an electric bike, catching Fei Xin's gaze.
0:4:14|0:4:22|The scene shifts to a dimly lit room, where a man swiftly puts on a leather jacket and approaches with a face wearing sunglasses.
0:4:22|0:4:31|The man in leather jacket walked through several dimly lit rooms and entered the garage with echoes.
0:4:31|0:4:37|As the rolling shutter slowly rises, the man in leather jacket opens the car door and sits down, puts on his glossy leather gloves, and starts the car.
0:4:40|0:4:48|Fei Xin followed behind a man in sportswear, and the two of them walked through the corridor of the house, arriving at the spacious outdoor balcony in no time.
0:4:48|0:4:52|The man in sportswear is also wearing sunglasses and chewing gum in his mouth.
0:4:52|0:4:58|Next to the outdoor pool stands a police officer, while a female corpse floats in the middle of the pool.
0:4:58|0:5:4|The man took the disposable gloves handed to him by the two people and walked towards the young man who was explaining the situation.
0:5:31|0:5:35|The police officer Chen, who came to take over the job, stood with his hands on his hips.
0:5:40|0:5:42|He waved at [Qiu Le], who was looking at the corpse.
0:6:32|0:6:49|[Fei Xin] turned around, looked at the deceased's husband who was asking questions, then turned back and waved to the subordinate behind Officer Chen, signaling him to come over.
0:6:49|0:6:50|Fei Xin later pushed his subordinates into the shadow pool.
0:7:1|0:7:23|Fei Xin splashed around in the pool a couple of times before realizing the water only reached his waist. He walked up to Officer Chen, then went over to pat the deceased's husband and took an envelope from his pocket. Officer Chen took the envelope from Fei Xin's hand, who then walked over to the still crying family members.
0:7:31|0:7:33|The man questioned by [Fei Xin] clearly froze.
0:7:35|0:7:40|Speak up, the man actually wanted to attack the deceased's husband, [Fei Xin] shook his head with a smile.
0:7:45|0:7:47|Fei Xin opens his arms wide and gestures.
0:7:49|0:7:51|Qiu Le nodded and said a few words.
0:7:55|0:8:14|Qiu Le got up to leave, with his subordinate who was explaining the situation following behind him with a smile, but he was grabbed by Officer Chen by the collar.
0:8:14|0:8:23|The scene shifts to a flashback, a thief is running wildly on the street, and [Qiu Le], wearing a tank top and floral shorts, sees the danger, swings his arms and starts running, while the police shout for him to stop.
0:8:25|0:8:48|[Qiu Le] just passed the police, then slowed down to draw the gun at his waist. With one shot, he hit the thief's leg. The thief covered his leg, and the scene shifted to another action. A team of police officers were approaching cautiously along the wall with their guns raised, while on the other side, another team was also ready to surround the abandoned building. Everyone crouched down.
0:8:48|0:8:51|Trying not to make too much noise, afraid of alerting the criminals inside.
0:8:55|0:8:59|Suddenly, a car drove up and [Qiu Le] got out of the car and closed the door.
0:9:2|0:9:6|He then raised his index finger and proceeded to pull out the gun from his waist and load it.
0:9:6|0:9:9|Colleagues saw that he had already moved forward, so they could only grit their teeth and follow.
0:9:9|0:9:14|Unexpectedly, as soon as [Qiu Le] walked in, he encountered the ambush set up by the guards.
0:9:14|0:9:15|He only noticed when he turned around.
0:9:21|0:9:24|A hand is flipping through photos of [Qiu Le]'s swollen face from the injury.
0:9:41|0:9:44|[Niu Jieshi] took the documents and handed them to the superior officer, while looking at his colleague.
0:9:44|0:9:56|[Qiu Le] held a document with a big title that read "termination order." Due to his impulsive personality, which caused too many unnecessary casualties, he was stripped of his police officer status.
0:9:56|0:10:2|[Qiu Le] left the police station with a newly received birthday gift in one hand, a plush bear, and a cardboard box in the other.
0:10:4|0:10:10|The scene cuts to [Fei Xin], who has rushed to the hospital and is now sitting outside the delivery room waiting.
0:10:10|0:10:16|Amidst the hustle and bustle around him, he maintained the same posture until a nurse pushed a cart over.
0:10:21|0:10:30|In Fei Xin's perspective, the nurse's eyes that were revealed were staring at him fiercely, and the surgical knives on the cart were also pointing towards him.
0:10:30|0:10:38|As the cart approached, [Fei Xin] leaned back in fear. The nurse, however, turned the corner and looked at the nurse who had just called her name before turning away, muttering softly to herself.
0:10:43|0:10:51|After shouting, [Fei Xin] took a deep breath, looked at the sign of the delivery room for a few seconds, and instead of walking towards it, turned around and left.
0:10:51|0:11:2|He arrived at the underground parking lot, walking under the dim lights. Suddenly, a car with its headlights on stopped in front of him. The bright lights dazzled him, so he raised his hand and turned his body to look over, only to see a short-haired beauty getting out of the car.
0:11:3|0:11:8|He walked towards the beauty, put down the beauty's car, and brushed past her.
0:11:8|0:11:14|The man in the driver's seat, wearing sunglasses, exchanged a glance with [Qiu Le] before seeing the car drive away as much as possible.
0:11:14|0:11:19|The short-haired beauty smiled at [Qu Jian], who walked up to her and spoke.
0:11:22|0:11:27|[Qu Jian] nodded, tightened his hands, and held the car keys in his hands.
0:11:34|0:11:47|[Qu Jian] nodded, and the short-haired beauty looked at him, breaking the silence.
0:11:47|0:11:51|[Ou Jian] nodded and transferred the car keys to the other hand.
0:11:51|0:11:57|The scene cuts to indoors, where a short-haired beauty enters carrying a basket of flowers.
0:11:57|0:11:59|Shen Jiamei walks to the changing table.
0:12:12|0:12:16|Shen Jiamei looked around the room, thought for a moment, then turned around and asked.
0:12:19|0:12:23|[Nan Fang] put away his smile, pursed his lips, lowered his head and sighed.
0:12:39|0:12:44|[Nan Fang] thought for a moment, seeming to confirm, then pursed his lips. The scene shifted to [Fei Xin].
0:12:44|0:12:49|He walked quickly into the restaurant and brushed past a man, looking puzzled for a moment.
0:12:49|0:12:53|But he did not linger too long and continued to walk in.
0:12:53|0:12:56|Glancing at [Qiu Le], he sat down at the door.
0:12:56|0:13:0|[Qiu Le] was looking at his phone and drinking cola, then he put down the cup and asked.
0:13:2|0:13:6|[Fei Xin] responded with a fork in hand.
0:14:21|0:14:29|After they got married, her husband pursued her, but then he started to become increasingly indifferent towards her.
0:14:44|0:14:45|Nervous at the scene of the crime.
0:14:51|0:15:3|Turning his head, the two had finished their meal. [Qiu Le] sat on a chair while [Fei Xin] picked up a ping pong paddle, pausing to catch his breath before setting it down and speaking.
0:15:3|0:15:9|[Fei Xin] also walked to the chair and sat down, picked up the wine on the table and took a big gulp, then turned to ask.
0:15:16|0:15:21|The dog at home hung its head as if drunk.
0:15:21|0:15:25|The door slowly opens, revealing [Qu Jian] peeking out, with people outside the door.
0:15:28|0:15:33|[Ou Jian] took the document bag handed over by the delivery man and watched him leave before closing the door.
0:15:56|0:15:58|[Ou Jian] saw the news report on TV.
0:15:58|0:16:6|Hastily opening the document bag, Fei Xin took out the insurance policy inside and flipped through a few pages. At the bottom, the name of the beneficiary was written as his own.
0:16:6|0:16:12|He thought for a moment, raised his head and looked towards the direction of the bedroom, the scene shifted to the bedroom.
0:16:12|0:16:20|[Ou Jian] stood at the dark doorway for a while before walking inside. Inside, the man was sitting on the bed, holding the baby.
0:16:20|0:16:23|Passing by the window, his figure darkened due to the backlight.
0:16:26|0:16:34|[Nan Fang] heard a voice, turned around, smiled at him, looked at the baby in his arms, then stood up, put the baby back on the changing table, and sat down again.
0:16:38|0:16:47|[Ou Jian] turned his head away.
0:16:47|0:16:48|He turned around.
0:16:53|0:16:56|[Nan Fang] widened his eyes, pulled the corners of his mouth, and Ou Jian spoke again.
0:16:59|0:17:3|[Nan Fang] didn't know how to respond, so he lowered his head, but Ou Jian continued speaking.
0:17:22|0:17:28|[Nan Fang] finished speaking with a hand on his waist, and Ou Jian, after listening to his explanation, turned his head and took a deep breath.
0:17:39|0:17:46|[Nan Fang] looked up at her husband, waiting for his reaction, but he just turned his head slightly and said nothing.
0:17:46|0:17:47|[Nan Fang] pursed his lips and said.
0:17:52|0:17:56|After speaking, she lifted the diaper with one hand and exerted force to support herself to stand up.
0:17:56|0:18:3|And Ou Jian still maintained a sideways posture, not looking at her, just silently turned his head and sighed.
0:18:3|0:18:14|Passing by Ou Jian, [Nan Fang] glanced at him and then walked towards the restroom with a hand on his waist.
0:18:14|0:18:19|Sensing Nan Fang's departure, Ou Jian finally turned his head and looked at Nan Fang's back.
0:18:32|0:18:41|He then put down his phone, turned around and looked through the blinds at [Qu Jian] outside. At that moment, [Qu Jian] was standing near the changing table, gazing at the child in the wall.
0:18:44|0:19:5|The child opened his mouth and looked at him. [Qu Jian] reached out his hand, stopped just before getting close to the child's face, paused for a moment, then looked up at the bathroom. He then clenched his fist next to the changing table, and the man behind the bathroom window saw this scene and pressed the flush button on the toilet.
0:19:42|0:19:59|Next, the next Korean client took out a gun and placed it on the table, while two burly men also pulled out their guns. The newly added dog pushed them away forcefully, and the client began to speak.
0:20:22|0:20:32|The scene shifts to the trading scene, hello, the leader of the Tai Palace with her hands clasped together, the traitor in the client's mouth has the same face as [Qiu Le].
0:20:45|0:21:1|Trading begins inside the building, Tai Fang opens the money bag, while the other side opens the bag to reveal toy guns. Both sides immediately raise their guns and confront each other. The traitor outside takes out a phone, ignites an explosion, and ends up running away with the money and guns. What a bastard.
0:21:10|0:21:19|The customer leaned forward to take off his glasses, then put them back on. Across from him, [Fei Xin] quickly took off his sunglasses, and couldn't help but laugh when he saw clearly.
0:22:1|0:22:3|Xuan Bing said.
0:22:7|0:22:8|The customer said.
0:22:16|0:22:18|Later, [Qu Jian] walked in.
0:22:37|0:22:39|[Fei Xin] got up and took the letter.
0:22:46|0:22:50|[Fei Xin] lowered his head and walked out with the letter, waving his hand and putting on sunglasses.
0:22:50|0:22:56|Soon, the two of them arrived at a café and leaned against the door frame to take a look.
0:22:56|0:23:2|At this moment, the man with glasses is sitting with his head down, while [Fei Xin] is walking ahead and greeting.
0:23:9|0:23:10|Qiu Le leaned in and asked.
0:23:14|0:23:16|[Nan Fang] watches as the two whisper to each other.
0:23:27|0:23:28|The waiter approached and inquired.
0:23:32|0:23:34|[Fei Xin] finished speaking before turning to ask [Qiu Le] for his opinion.
0:23:34|0:23:38|[Qiu Le] has finished signing, taking the photo handed over by [Nan Fang], causing a sigh from [Fei Xin].
0:23:43|0:23:47|[Qiu Le] looked at [Nan Fang], who awkwardly touched his neck, and [Fei Xin] asked.
0:23:51|0:23:54|[Nan Fang] raised the hand next to his neck and took off his glasses.
0:24:11|0:24:14|Bei Xing held the ice just pulled out and brought over the coffee.
0:24:39|0:24:41|Fei Xin takes down the paper and puts it on the table.
0:24:44|0:24:48|[Nan Fang] picked up the paper and glanced at it, while [Fei Xin] gestured to [Qiu Le].
0:24:51|0:25:0|[Qiu Le] took out a book from his pocket, [Fei Xin] took it and then handed a pen to [Nan Fang].
0:25:0|0:25:2|[Nan Fang] took the book and pen.
0:25:14|0:25:21|[Nan Fang] nodded awkwardly, then wrote on the rabbit card as requested, signed his name, and said as he closed the pen cap.
0:25:31|0:25:33|[Fei Xin] handed the book to [Qiu Le] and smiled.
0:25:43|0:25:49|[Qu Jian] put on his glasses and smiled as he watched the two of them leave, but the smile disappeared from his face afterwards.
0:25:49|0:25:52|The scene then shifts to an alleyway.
0:25:52|0:25:56|The alley is located in Nan Cun, Ping'an Yicun, No. 27 Changbao Third Road.
0:25:56|0:26:2|As the girl riding an electric bike drove out of the intersection, it can be seen that [Nan Fang] has just arrived here.
0:26:2|0:26:5|She arrived at a household, where two door gods' portraits were still pasted on the glass door.
0:26:7|0:26:12|He gently closed the door, then slowly turned around, illuminating everything in the room.
0:26:12|0:26:18|In the not-so-large living room, there is a portrait of a woman on the table directly facing the door.
0:26:18|0:26:29|[Nan Fang] looked at the memorial for a moment, lowered his head, picked up the photo frame on the table. In the frame, he and [Ou Jian] were holding hands and facing the camera, with the words "National Special" visible in the background.
0:26:29|0:26:30|His thoughts were pulled back to the past.
0:26:32|0:26:37|It was when he was in South Korea, walking with his head down and carrying a bag in the snow.
0:26:37|0:26:42|On the closed roller shutter door by the roadside, there are three large posters of Ou Jian.
0:26:42|0:26:47|He stopped and looked at the poster, with snow falling continuously beside him.
0:26:47|0:26:51|One shines brightly on the world stage, while the other coolsly enters prison.
0:26:51|0:26:57|Tesla stepped on the snow, the surroundings were eerily quiet, only the sound of the wind echoing past.
0:26:57|0:27:6|After the screen fades to black, it cuts to a cemetery. Tesla is standing in front of a tombstone that reads "Xie Shijun, born on October 17, 1953, passed away on June 18, 2013."
0:27:10|0:27:14|The photo on the tombstone is the same as the woman on the tombstone.
0:27:14|0:27:19|In the middle of the graveyard surrounded by trees, Tesla's tears fell silently.
0:27:19|0:27:24|She remembered her days in prison, the scene shifted to the cold prison.
0:27:24|0:27:28|Tesla sat against the wall with a bandage on his forehead.
0:27:28|0:27:31|Not long ago, [Shen Jiamei] rose from the bathhouse, and there were already people standing outside the pool.
0:27:32|0:27:40|One person smashed a basin towards her, the person behind caught her as she fell, and pushed her forward again, her head engraved on the edge of the pool.
0:27:40|0:27:46|One person grabbed her hair, but she used both hands to pull the person's neck and dragged him into the pool.
0:27:46|0:27:50|Then she pressed with one hand and ruthlessly pounded down with the other hand fist by fist.
0:27:51|0:27:59|The person broke free, and someone outside the pool grabbed [Tesla] from behind, raising the other hand to stab him with a pen.
0:28:9|0:28:14|Then he pushed the other person's head against the wall and fiercely smashed it into the wall.
0:28:14|0:28:21|At this moment, a burly man rushed over and grabbed [Tesla] from behind, while another companion came up and punched him in the abdomen.
0:28:21|0:28:28|But just as the attack came, [Tesla] threw off the strong man behind him, swinging his fist to knock down the person who was hitting him.
0:28:28|0:28:36|He squatted down to continue fighting, and the burly man who had just been thrown off came forward again to grab him, but he pushed back hard with his head, causing the man to fall down in pain.
0:28:36|0:28:44|Then [Tesla] with his own and someone else's blood on his face, once again squatted down and collapsed on the ground.
0:28:44|0:28:51|The memory ended, [Tesla] took out a photo while walking, lit it with a lighter, and then threw it on the ground.
0:28:51|0:28:57|The scene shifts to [Fei Xin] and [Qiu Le], who are sitting in a large company waiting for an interview.
0:29:22|0:29:30|[Qiu Le] turned back and leaned in again. [Fei Xin] turned around impatiently and asked.
0:29:30|0:29:33|[Qiu Le] awkwardly stroked his chin, while [Fei Xin] began to speak.
0:29:56|0:29:58|Fei Xin snapped his fingers.
0:30:14|0:30:20|The person at the same table gratefully shook hands and was about to follow the HR, [Qiu Le] moved the chair slightly to let him pass.
0:30:20|0:30:26|In the office at this moment, [Fei Xin] spoke with a mouthful of food, picked up a teacup, choked a bit, and looked up.
0:30:52|0:30:55|[Ou Jian] smiled and turned his head, then looked at him again.
0:31:9|0:31:13|[Ou Jian] tilted his head to one side, muttering under his breath in silence.
0:31:13|0:31:18|After work, [Qu Jian] arrived at the gym, and the tracking of [Fei Xin] continued.
0:31:18|0:31:22|Fei Xin is seen standing on his head, with blood already rushing to his head.
0:31:26|0:31:31|Over there, [Qu Jian] is giving a massage to a plump beauty, occasionally stealing glances at her.
0:31:31|0:31:35|Over here, [Fei Xin] can no longer hold on and puts his leg down.
0:31:35|0:31:38|Over there, [Qu Jian] has already started practicing boxing.
0:31:38|0:31:41|[Fei Xin] and [Qiu Le] are struggling to lift their legs.
0:31:41|0:31:47|[Fei Xin] is observing [Qu Jian] closely, as they engage in their final training.
0:31:47|0:31:51|[Fei Xin] stared at [Qu Jian] who was practicing boxing without taking his eyes off his partner's buttocks.
0:31:52|0:31:58|Just now, Fei Xin, who had been secretly watching the voluptuous beauty of Ou Jian, saw the fierceness of Ou Jian's boxing, smirked, and then turned and walked away.
0:31:58|0:32:5|After finishing his workout, Fei Xin changed back into his suit and walked into the elevator. Just as the elevator doors were about to close, they were stopped by a hand.
0:32:5|0:32:10|Previously in the parking lot, after [Shen Jiamei]'s man walked in, Ou Jian glanced at him and pressed the close button again.
0:32:11|0:32:26|The elevator doors closed, and Fei Xin and Qiu Le stood side by side. Ou Jian touched his face, his hand dropping unnaturally, remembering how this man had been staring at him while driving, the surgical knife on the cart in the hospital, and the car that had crashed in front of him on the road.
0:32:27|0:32:41|At this moment, [Shen Jiamei]'s man reached for his waist, and Ou Jian immediately reacted by placing one hand on his chest and pushing him up, causing a bunch of keys to fall to the ground. The man leaned against the elevator wall, and a gun also fell out from his waist.
0:32:41|0:32:48|Ou Jian looked down and, taking advantage of this opening, the man immediately pushed Ou Jian back and threw a punch.
0:32:48|0:32:52|But Ou Jian immediately reacted and fought back, knocking the man down to the ground.
0:32:52|0:32:58|The elevator reached the floor, [Qu Jian] quickly walked out of the elevator, the man sat on the ground panting, putting on sunglasses.
0:32:58|0:33:5|Soon after, at the exit of the parking lot, [Fei Xin] saw [Qu Jian] driving out and parked in front of him.
0:33:14|0:33:16|And so, the two of them lost track of each other.
0:33:16|0:33:19|The scene shifts to nighttime, inside a bar, where the customers are chatting.
0:33:44|0:33:50|[Ou Jian] took a sip of wine, loosened his tie, and his friend next to him wearing a hat took out a stack of papers from his back pocket and handed it to him.
0:33:59|0:34:1|The other party sighed.
0:34:2|0:34:3|[Ou Jian] looked up at him.
0:34:11|0:34:17|Fei Xin's friend's phone rang, and he raised his hand to pick up the phone.
0:34:29|0:34:38|[Qu Jian] looked at the call records on the paper, noticed what he said, raised his head, and stared at his mouth opening and closing in contemplation.
0:34:38|0:34:50|After finishing the call, [Qu Jian]’s phone rang. He picked it up and saw it was a call from a man, then hung up and stared at his friend until the friend noticed his gaze.
0:34:58|0:35:2|A friend patted his arm, but he remained motionless.
0:35:15|0:35:19|Before the friend could speak, they were hit on the head by someone.
0:35:33|0:35:37|[Ou Jian] pulled his friend to run outside, but was entangled by several people.
0:35:37|0:35:42|The scene shifts to an electronics store, where [Fei Xin] walks in and the boss asks.
0:35:45|0:35:51|Various high-end tech products are displayed on the shelves, with [Tesla] squatting in front of a row of shelves picking out items.
0:35:51|0:35:58|He came to another monitor, his face appeared on the screen, then he went to another store.
0:35:58|0:36:3|The shop was dimly lit at night, with the faint light shining on his face as he asked the owner at the table.
0:36:13|0:36:20|The boss took a laptop from the shelf next to him and handed it to Fei Xin. After a brief glance, Fei Xin left.
0:36:20|0:36:26|In the alley next to the Electronic City, an electric bike drives by, with [Tesla] standing against the wall talking on the phone.
0:36:26|0:36:41|Next, he hung up the phone and got into a van, opened the computer he just received, with his photo on the left side of the screen and started matching on the right side. Several photos of men and women flashed by, until finally [Qiu Le]'s photo appeared, with a surprising similarity of 98%.
0:36:43|0:36:49|Next, [Tesla] came to the bathroom, took off his glasses in front of the mirror, and placed them on the washbasin.
0:36:49|0:36:56|Then she picked up the comb and hair dye next to her, squeezed the dye onto the comb, and started dyeing her own hair.
0:36:56|0:37:0|[Tesla] has a lot of white hair, while [Qiu Le] still has all black hair.
0:37:0|0:37:8|He took the hair dye and combed it back one by one, and then picked up the eyebrow pencil to touch up his eyebrows.
0:37:12|0:37:18|The scene changes to the front desk of a hotel, where a hand places [Qiu Le]'s ID card.
0:37:18|0:37:22|The receptionist took it and glanced at it, then looked at the ID card, smiling.
0:37:28|0:37:30|The receptionist walks to the side.
0:37:30|0:37:34|The person standing in front of the counter is none other than [Tesla], who looks exactly like [Qiu Le].
0:37:34|0:37:39|He is wearing a checkered shirt, carrying a bag and luggage, and opening a door to a room.
0:37:39|0:37:43|The camera cuts to [Nan Fang]'s home, where he is sitting on the sofa reading a book.
0:37:43|0:37:50|Outside the glass window, Ou Jian just arrived at the door and opened it. [Nan Fang] looked up and set the book in his hand aside.
0:37:50|0:37:53|Just as he was about to take off his glasses, his hand hesitated for a moment.
0:37:54|0:37:59|He took off his glasses and stood up, reaching out to touch Fei Xin's face.
0:37:59|0:38:10|Ou Jian quickly dodged and then grabbed his arm.
0:38:10|0:38:12|Ou Jian finished speaking with his head down and was about to leave.
0:38:12|0:38:16|[Nan Fang]'s hand hung in the air, with a complex emotion in his eyes.
0:38:16|0:38:20|Ou Jian walked upstairs, [Nan Fang] closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and lowered his head.
0:38:24|0:38:39|He turned around and picked up his phone, while Ou Jian was watching him at the corner of the stairs.
0:38:39|0:38:47|Ou Jian stood on the stairs and thought for a moment. When Nan Fang left, he took a video of Nan Fang getting into the car on the second floor with his phone.
0:38:48|0:38:55|After Fei Xin got into the car, Qiu Le leaned back and thought for a moment before raising his eyes, which were rolling.
0:38:55|0:39:1|The scene shifts to a sign that reads "Running for Dad".
0:39:1|0:39:6|With the air gun firing, many children and parents under the billboard started running.
0:39:6|0:39:10|A man is pushing a stroller and walking side by side with a woman, chatting.
0:39:11|0:39:15|In the parking lot not far away, [Ou Jian] sat in the car, holding up a cellphone.
0:39:15|0:39:21|At the same time, in a dimly lit room, two screens are on, with [Tesla] operating on a laptop.
0:39:23|0:39:42|Back at the parking lot, [Qu Jian] in the car is holding a phone, staring at the screen showing [Nan Fang] walking. Meanwhile, [Fei Xin] is sitting at a table holding a phone, with the screen showing [Qu Jian] holding a phone. Unaware that he is being watched, the [Qu Jian] facing the camera continues to monitor [Nan Fang].
0:39:42|0:39:51|On screen, [Qu Jian] furrowed his brow while [Tesla] leisurely picked up an apple from the table and took a bite. The scene then shifted to inside the coffee shop, where [Fei Xin] spoke to [Nan Fang].
0:42:9|0:42:14|[Fei Xin] turned his open hand over, the pen drew a leaf that curved again, indicating agreement.
0:42:14|0:42:29|The man standing up and putting on sunglasses walked away. Following his gaze, [Tesla], wearing a duckbill cap, was sitting at a table outside with high-end glasses purchased from the electronics city placed on the table, monitoring them.
0:42:29|0:42:31|On the phone screen are [Qiu Le] and [Fei Xin] being aimed at by sunglasses.
0:42:40|0:42:46|The scene shifts to a dock, where [Qu Jian] gets off a car and leans against it, flipping through various documents about [Nan Fang].
0:42:46|0:42:50|The number on the phone bill caught his attention.
0:42:50|0:42:53|He put down the phone bill and then dialed a number.
0:42:53|0:43:0|At this moment, [Fei Xin] who is at [Nan Fang]'s house, answers the phone.
0:43:3|0:43:5|[Fei Xin] confronted [Nan Fang].
0:43:14|0:43:20|[Ou Jian] heard the voice of [Nan Fang] coming from the other end, furrowing his brows instantly and looking up in confusion.
0:43:20|0:43:26|But soon, he opened the car door and got in, at this moment, [Nan Fang] was greeting [Fei Xin].
0:43:26|0:43:33|[Fei Xin] opened the wardrobe in the bedroom and took a sniff.
0:43:38|0:43:40|[Nan Fang] pointed to the door and said.
0:43:40|0:43:45|Fei Xin walked outside and first noticed the Time magazine cover on the wall.
0:43:45|0:43:50|Continuing, she lowered her head and scanned around, looking at the photo frame on the table, then picked it up.
0:43:53|0:43:56|[Nan Fang] followed her gaze to the wall.
0:44:0|0:44:2|She lowered her head, as if remembering something.
0:44:13|0:44:17|[Nan Fang] pointed upstairs and walked up, [Fei Xin] put down the photo frame and followed.
0:44:17|0:44:24|On the other side, [Qiu Le] is driving home, following the decorative lights in the neighborhood all the way towards his house.
0:44:24|0:44:27|And [Qu Jian] is sitting in the car by the roadside, keeping watch.
0:44:27|0:44:33|He had one hand on the steering wheel and the other resting on the car window, chewing gum in his mouth.
0:44:33|0:44:38|In a hurry, [Qiu Le] suddenly had a blowout after turning a corner.
0:44:38|0:44:41|He got off the car, took a look, and quickly decided to run back home.
0:44:41|0:44:48|[Qiu Le] took big strides, seeing home getting closer and closer, but his steps became more hurried, even his breathing quickened a bit.
0:44:49|0:44:58|[Qiu Le] happened to see a security guard at his doorstep and leaned out to ask him.
0:44:58|0:45:6|[Qiu Le] had just gotten off the car when Ou Jian rushed up behind him and reached out his hand. [Qiu Le] turned around, leaving Ou Jian stunned.
0:45:6|0:45:11|[Qiu Le] glanced at him, walked away quickly, leaving Ou Jian still in a daze.
0:45:11|0:45:16|He glanced at the car, then at the direction [Qiu Le] had left, and then came to his senses and ran back home.
0:45:17|0:45:21|Upon entering, the room was pitch black with no lights on.
0:45:21|0:45:25|Ou Jian closed the door, took off his shoes, and walked inside, rubbing his hands and feet.
0:45:25|0:45:30|He first scanned the living room and, finding nothing unusual, looked up at the upstairs.
0:45:30|0:45:35|He stood downstairs and saw the light shining from the bedroom on the second floor.
0:45:35|0:45:42|Think about it, take out the phone from the pocket, check the call records, and dial the number again.
0:45:42|0:45:44|Next, a cell phone rang on the second floor.
0:46:8|0:46:12|In the room of the divorce case, both of them took a breath, said [Ou Jian].
0:46:12|0:46:16|He lowered his head and finally walked out the door.
0:46:16|0:46:23|The man gently pressed down, and after [Qu Jian] walked away a bit, he twisted his head while turning his body, and then got off the bed with his legs.
0:46:23|0:46:28|Reaching under the pillow, [Fei Xin] pulled out another cellphone and then placed it on the bedside table.
0:46:29|0:46:45|After doing all this, she quickly turned her head as if she had sensed someone behind her, but found no one there. She looked anxiously at the door, breathing heavily, and slowly calmed down.
0:46:45|0:46:58|At this moment, it was late at night outside. Under the dim lights, [Qu Jian] looked down from the second-floor balcony, noticing [Qiu Le]'s car. He then walked downstairs, checked that there was no one in the car, and looked around.
0:46:58|0:47:4|He then carefully walked to the side of the car and, upon getting closer, noticed that the car window was not closed.
0:47:4|0:47:11|He then turned back again to make sure no one was around, and reached his hand from outside the car window into the driver's seat, continuously feeling for the left turn signal.
0:47:12|0:47:18|After feeling a book, it was taken out and opened to the first page, which was exactly the Southern Fairy Tales written by [Nan Fang].
0:47:18|0:47:33|[Qu Jian] was shocked when he saw this book. He carefully flipped through it under the dim light, with [Nan Fang]'s rabbit bookmark next to him. His signature below was particularly eye-catching. He kept flipping the book back and forth, his expression somewhat solemn.
0:47:33|0:47:39|Ou Jian lifted his head, his eyes rolling, while over where the car slipped away, Fei Xin was in distress.
0:48:11|0:48:18|The scene cuts to [Qu Jian], looking gloomy as he sits at his desk, raising the glass of wine in his hand and taking a sip.
0:48:18|0:48:23|After placing the cup on the table, he reached up and loosened the mask on his face a bit.
0:48:23|0:48:28|When his head tilted to the other side, he seemed to remember something.
0:48:28|0:48:34|He then opened the drawer next to him and took out a photo frame, which contained a picture of two people.
0:48:50|0:49:9|Watching the photo and sinking into memories, [Qu Jian] took another sip of wine. Then he got up and walked to the wardrobe, opened the door, and found a cardboard box underneath the hanging white shirt. He took out a baseball bat from it, then walked to the center of the living room, paused for a moment, and held the bat in his palm facing forward.
0:49:9|0:49:22|The baseball bat rested against the tiger's mouth, the body slightly pulled back, hands gripping the bat in one smooth motion, then swung forward with force, silently mouthing something, while executing the swinging motion.
0:49:22|0:49:28|After waving twice, he stopped and placed two fingers on his lower lip, recalling, and then gestured with his hand to indicate a location.
0:49:28|0:49:34|He walked to the corner of the wall and put down the baseball bat, raising both hands to gesture the position, and then slowly put them down.
0:49:35|0:49:39|Close your eyes and envision possible scenarios in your mind.
0:49:39|0:49:49|A masked man holding a dagger stabbed towards him from behind, he grabbed the man's arm with one hand and placed the other arm under the man's armpit, then forcefully knocked him down to the ground.
0:49:49|0:49:53|The masked man reacted quickly, raising his other hand, only to be blocked by [Qiu Le].
0:49:53|0:50:1|At the same time, the masked man quickly got up and threw punches from side to side, but was dodged by [Qiu Le], who then controlled one of his arms in the same manner.
0:50:1|0:50:6|But this time the masked man quickly drew out his weapon and forced [Qiu Le] to lie down on the table.
0:50:6|0:50:10|[Qiu Le] raised his hand to block him, then stood up and jumped off the table to pin him down on the ground.
0:50:10|0:50:15|He looked up and saw the baseball bat in the corner, but before he could reach for it, he was stabbed by the masked man.
0:50:15|0:50:22|The practice ended, [Qiu Le] shook his head, moved the bat closer to the cabinet, and started practicing again.
0:50:22|0:50:26|After knocking down the masked man this time, he picked up the baseball bat and knocked him unconscious.
0:50:29|0:50:44|The scene shifts to [Fei Xin], who is sitting at a table entering information into a computer. The search bar displays the name [Qiu Le], and the interface switches to show another side where Tesla is also busy on the computer. Soon, [Fei Xin]'s computer screen instantly shows no relevant pages.
0:50:46|0:50:59|As the lines of code in Tesla were completed, [Fei Xin] returned and entered again, only to quickly find that it still redirected to an unrelated page. Finally, Tesla's computer displayed "data cleared," prompting an annoyed exclamation from [Fei Xin].
0:51:3|0:51:18|The information on the computer interface disappeared in front of [Fei Xin], who touched his face with his hand. The screen then turned black and shifted to a bar, where [Qiu Le] was sitting at the bar counter, pouring the small glass of liquor in front of him into a larger glass.
0:51:20|0:51:25|He, who had already drunk a lot beforehand, picked up the wine glass and drank it all in one gulp.
0:51:33|0:51:36|At this moment, a beautiful woman walked over to him and asked:
0:51:48|0:51:51|Just as he was about to finish drinking, a hand reached over and took his glass.
0:51:56|0:52:3|[Tang Chan] took the wine glass, brought it to his lips, took a sip, then propped his head with one hand and looked at [Ou Jian].
0:52:3|0:52:8|[Ou Jian] picked up the can again, ready to pour the remaining small wine glasses, but was taken away by [Tang Chan].
0:52:8|0:52:16|[Tang Chan] glanced at him with a flickering gaze, then put two small wine glasses into the large cup.
0:52:16|0:52:21|[Qiu Le] turned to look at him, picked up a glass of wine, leaned forward, and said to [Qiu Le].
0:52:25|0:52:32|The two looked at each other and smiled, then [Tang Chen] drank the wine in his hand, and [Ou Jian] also finished the wine in his glass.
0:52:32|0:52:40|Shortly afterwards, [Qu Jian] was assisted by [Tang Chen] to the hotel, where he threw his coat onto the bed and lay down himself.
0:52:41|0:52:48|[Tang Chan] then smiled and took a few steps back, turned around and entered the bathroom. After that, in front of the mirror, he untied his hair and took off his clothes.
0:52:48|0:52:56|On the bed, [Ou Jian] seemed somewhat awake as he raised his head, looking at the hotel room in front of him, and then glanced at [Tang Chan].
0:52:56|0:52:58|He then covered his eyes with his hand in front of his forehead.
0:52:59|0:53:5|[Tang Chan], who had changed into a bathrobe, walked over and sat down in front of him, reaching out to unbutton his shirt.
0:53:5|0:53:12|[Qu Jian] just stared blankly at [Tang Chan], then looked down at the hands on his chest without saying a word.
0:53:12|0:53:20|Next, he took out a condom and was about to tear it open, but was stopped by [Qu Jian] who raised his hand and slapped it away.
0:53:20|0:53:23|[Tang Chan] looked at him blankly, and he explained with a smile.
0:53:39|0:53:52|[Ou Jian] patted his chest, while [Tang Chen] smiled and took off the hair clip. Then she reached out to sweep her hair back, and then threw herself into [Ou Jian]'s arms by the bed, kissing his cheek affectionately and caressing his waist.
0:53:52|0:54:2|Slowly, he started kissing [Qu Jian]. Under the night sky, amidst the lights, fireworks were set off, while the two inside the house must have had a passionate night, and the scene gradually darkened.
0:54:3|0:54:19|After a night, [Ou Jian]'s coat was placed on the hotel bed. He woke up naked and sat up, rubbing his temples due to a hangover. With half-opened eyes, he glanced around the room before shifting his gaze to the window.
0:54:31|0:54:42|[Ou Jian] opened the door of room 1017 from inside. Before he could close the door, a man wearing a hat and a mask, pushing a cleaning cart, approached from a distance.
0:54:45|0:54:50|The man nodded and quickly walked into room 1017, closing the door behind him.
0:54:50|0:55:2|Upon entering the room, Fei Xin took out a camera from the cleaning car, looked around, and started shooting everywhere inside the house.
0:55:2|0:55:5|[Ou Jian] then arrived at the front desk in the lobby.
0:55:19|0:55:25|[Ou Jian] returned to that floor and ran towards 1017.
0:55:25|0:55:28|The door of room 1017 was wide open.
0:55:28|0:55:31|After he entered, he looked around and a female janitor asked.
0:55:43|0:55:51|At this moment, at the back door of the hotel building, [Qiu Le], who has changed back into his own clothes, walks out with a camera in hand. As he opens the car door, he says to [Fei Xin].
0:56:6|0:56:8|[Ou Jian] arrived at a clothing store.
0:56:16|0:56:18|She stood with her hands behind her back, looking at the clothes displayed in the shop.
0:56:18|0:56:23|At this moment, [Shen Jiamei] walked out from inside, and both of them smiled.
0:56:24|0:56:28|[Shen Jiamei] walked up to her, followed by a little boy behind her.
0:56:28|0:56:31|Ou Jian looked at the little boy.
0:56:40|0:56:48|Outside the clothing store, on the street, [Qiu Le] stops the car, [Fei Xin] holds a camera and takes pictures, while [Qiu Le] raises a telescope to look.
0:56:48|0:56:57|In the store, [Shen Jiamei] took measurements of [Ou Jian] as if hugging him after coming out of the fitting room, then stepped back after pulling the tape measure taut, and looked at it, saying.
0:57:14|0:57:17|Qu Jian thought for a moment, then leaned over slightly and said.
0:57:18|0:57:28|[Shen Jiamei] blinked, lowered her head, took a measuring tape and walked up to Ou Jian, wrapping the tape around his neck.
0:57:28|0:57:34|Ou Jian slightly lowered his head, the two facing each other very closely, [Shen Jiamei] spoke again.
0:57:46|0:57:50|[Shen Jiamei] went to measure the size of her arms again. Upon hearing Ou Jian's words, she pursed her lips.
0:57:53|0:57:58|Jiamei didn't look up, Fei Xin's eyes flickered slightly, Jiamei looked at him, waiting for his answer.
0:57:58|0:58:2|[Qu Jian] first avoided eye contact, then glanced at Jiamei and said.
0:58:32|0:58:38|They were unaware that not far away, [Tesla] was also holding a camera and filming the actions of the two people in the store.
0:58:38|0:58:42|Returning home, [Qiu Le] said to [Fei Xin] who was picking up balls on the table.
0:58:47|0:58:49|She is [Ou Jian]'s ex-wife.
0:59:9|0:59:10|The scene shifts to a coffee shop.
0:59:13|0:59:30|The lower half of the face of the speaking [Tesla] is almost identical to [Qiu Le], he pushed the photos to the man, who looked through them one by one. The man felt a sourness in his nose as he tried to hold back his emotions, while the [Tesla] across from him took a sip of coffee and revealed a barely noticeable smile.
0:59:30|0:59:36|The scene shifts to [Shen Jiamei]'s home, where she is also sitting at a table looking at photos. Her phone vibrates, and she picks it up to answer.
0:59:44|0:59:58|The man who previously drove [Shen Jiamei] into the living room, poured a glass of water and walked behind [Shen Jiamei], saw a photo on the table with [Shen Jiamei], [Qiu Le], and [Fei Xin].
1:0:13|1:0:20|Shen Jiamei's husband casually picked up an apple from the fruit plate, took a bite as he walked, and glanced back at Shen Jiamei.
1:0:20|1:0:25|After returning to the bedroom, she first put on a suit jacket and then turned to the mirror to adjust the collar.
1:0:26|1:0:31|Continuing to squat on the ground, he unzipped a large bag and put the gun in his hand inside.
1:0:31|1:0:34|The big bag is already filled with all kinds of guns.
1:0:37|1:0:54|He zipped up his bag and walked out the door. The scene shifted to a restaurant with various slogans about bullwhips written on the glass. Inside, customers were scooping out freshly cooked dishes from the pot, toasting and chatting. The kitchen sent out a plate of bullwhips, and at a table, three pairs of chopsticks were used to cook together.
1:0:54|1:1:10|One of the hands belongs to Fei Xin's client, the Korean underworld boss. The woman under him saw him pick up the bullwhip and turned her head to the other side. The Korean boss took a bite of the bullwhip, and the black-clothed strong man beside him frowned and said, "Please enjoy."
1:1:28|1:1:37|One of the henchmen pointed at the Korean boss, and everyone at the table looked over.
1:1:46|1:1:48|As the voice fell, several henchmen stood up from the row of tables.
1:1:49|1:1:52|The Korean boss gestured everyone to sit down by extending his hand.
1:1:58|1:2:9|Husband Jia Mei, Du Ge, raised his glass and gestured towards the Korean table, smiling. The Korean table also raised their glasses, and both sides drank without saying a word.
1:2:9|1:2:16|Du Ge took off his jacket at this table, with "Du Ge Express" printed on his short sleeves. It turns out they are going to play real-life CS.
1:2:16|1:2:18|The scene shifts to [Nan Fang]'s home, where he opens the door.
1:2:21|1:2:26|[Nan Fang] reaches out to open the door.
1:2:26|1:2:32|[Nan Fang] walked to the dining table to pour water, while [Shen Jiamei] stood by, holding a lighter.
1:2:32|1:2:37|She looked around and saw the wedding photo of [Nan Fang] and Ou Jian on the wall, her expression changed immediately.
1:2:39|1:2:43|At this moment, [Nan Fang] walked up to her and looked at the wedding photo together.
1:2:43|1:2:50|Fei Xin turned her originally smiling face around, looking very indifferent, and asked her who was staring blankly at the wedding photo.
1:3:14|1:3:21|[Shen Jiamei] took out two bottles from the bag provided by [Fei Xin], [Nan Fang] walked over with a serious expression and threw a stack of photos on the table.
1:3:21|1:3:28|[Nan Fang] leaned on the table with one hand and held the just poured water with the other, feeling a slight tingling in the nose, as he said to [Shen Jiamei] who was looking at the photos.
1:4:28|1:4:31|The man splashed the water in his hand and shouted.
1:4:39|1:4:45|Jiamei wiped the water off with the back of her hand, took a deep breath, and said something to [Nan Fang].
1:4:49|1:4:54|After speaking, [Shen Jiamei] left towards the door, leaving [Nan Fang] standing in place, feeling both sad and angry.
1:4:54|1:5:7|[Nan Fang] watched as [Shen Jiamei] walked away, the veins on his neck bulging as he took deep breaths. Then, [Nan Fang] angrily overturned the water glass on the table, causing it to fall to the ground and spill water everywhere.
1:5:7|1:5:20|[Qu Jian] was sitting on a balcony by the sea at this moment, scrolling through pages and looking at various firearms. Meanwhile, [Fei Xin] was drinking coffee and monitoring [Qu Jian]'s browsing interface. [Qu Jian] highlighted a page and sent a message to the buyer, asking him:
1:5:26|1:5:32|[Fei Xin] The message popped up on the computer screen, causing him to quickly set down his cup and reply.
1:5:33|1:5:34|Continuing on.
1:5:39|1:5:44|[Qu Jian] took a sip of the wine on the table, muttered a few words, and replied "OK" to the buyer.
1:5:44|1:5:50|[Fei Xin] saw [Qu Jian] taking the bait, leaned back in the chair, and took a sip of coffee.
1:5:50|1:6:1|The scene shifts, with [Qu Jian] wearing sunglasses, holding a briefcase in one hand and an umbrella in the other, arriving at the entrance of an abandoned amusement park. Thick iron chains are wrapped around the gate of the amusement park.
1:6:4|1:6:12|He pushed the door back, there was no gap at all. Then he turned around, bent down to look at the lock on the door, gave it a pull, and a small section of the door opened.
1:6:12|1:6:19|The sign at the door reads, "Magician Shao Manbanam, will have you fooled in minutes."
1:6:19|1:6:26|Ou Jian turned around, took a look at the way he came, then bent down and went through the small door, walking towards the entrance of the amusement park.
1:6:27|1:6:31|An adult is leading a child ahead, while [Qu Jian] looks around.
1:6:31|1:6:39|From above, you can see that this place is located under an overpass, with abundant trees, an artificial lake, and some amusement facilities.
1:6:39|1:6:41|[Ou Jian] passed by a roller coaster track.
1:6:41|1:6:46|Fei Xin raised his wrist to wipe the sweat off his face, when suddenly a noise came from behind.
1:6:51|1:7:2|The high-speed roller coaster turned with the sharp laughter of children. Fei Xin got off and quickly turned his head, not noticing anything unusual, then looked around.
1:7:2|1:7:10|Further inside, there is a round railing entrance to the blood donation station with a flying chair. Warning, this facility is no longer in use, please do not climb or enter.
1:7:11|1:7:26|[Ou Jian] found a performance hall and walked in. The rhombus-patterned wallpaper was still adorned with large playing cards. Several people were performing on stage, while adults and children sat below the stage entrance. Next to them was an old lady.
1:7:26|1:7:31|On stage, a girl is holding a gun in her hand, being chased and playing around by two companions.
1:7:33|1:7:38|The little boy took the gun and pointed it at his own head, while the girl and the clown quickly waved their hands.
1:7:38|1:7:43|The little boy pointed the gun at [The Joker], who raised his hands in fear and backed away.
1:7:43|1:7:49|At this moment, all three of them noticed [Ou Jian] in the audience.
1:7:49|1:7:54|Then, the little boy pulled the trigger, and to everyone's surprise, [the clown] caught the bullet that was shot at him with both hands.
1:7:55|1:8:3|The three of them, Fei Xin, Qiu Le, and Qu Jian, happily jumped and spun around on the stage, the little boy handed the gun to [Clown], and then ran off the stage with the girl.
1:8:3|1:8:11|[The Clown] then pointed the gun at [Qu Jian], who calmly raised the scattered wings in his hand, and [The Clown] walked off the stage.
1:8:11|1:8:17|[Ou Jian] wanted to catch up with [Li Zong], and as he passed by the three people sitting down, the child suddenly turned his head to look at him.
1:8:17|1:8:24|The hall was decorated with various ribbons, and the tables and chairs were the kind of connected tables and chairs in the canteen. Everything was filled with a strange atmosphere.
1:8:27|1:8:31|[Qu Jian] walked up to a dressing room on the attic, where a boy's voice could be heard.
1:8:39|1:8:48|The round lights on the makeup mirror lit up, [Qu Jian] turned them on, [Fei Xin] walked in, looked at [Qu Jian], then smiled and walked to the side.
1:8:48|1:8:55|First, put the pistol that was just used in hand on the table, then place the customized box on top, and take out the gun wrapped in paper from inside.
1:9:1|1:9:5|Ou Jian opened the packaged handgun and picked up the one used by the clown.
1:9:5|1:9:8|Qu Jian grabbed the clown's arm, and the clown nodded.
1:9:26|1:9:29|Next, Ou Jian took out the prepared money from his briefcase.
1:9:29|1:9:33|The clown took it, nodded, and turned to walk to the mirror.
1:9:48|1:9:52|Ou Jian took advantage of this opportunity to swap the positions of two guns.
1:10:10|1:10:13|The scene cuts to the police station, Officer Chen pushes open the door.
1:10:25|1:10:31|The scene returns to Fei Xin's home, with photos of Nan Fang, Qu Jian, and Shen Jiamei on the wall.
1:10:31|1:10:34|He was staring at the relationship chart of these people, pursing his lips.
1:10:34|1:10:37|The doorbell rang, and he took out his phone to check.
1:10:37|1:10:41|He immediately walked downstairs and spoke to the already arrived Officer Chen.
1:11:27|1:11:34|We went to the hotel, [Officer Chen] stood with his hands on his hips, pursed his lips, and after a moment of thought, said.
1:11:39|1:11:45|[Fei Xin] came to the hotel with a photo of Qiu Le, accompanied by Officer Chen and his subordinates.
1:11:53|1:11:58|The receptionist led him to the monitoring room, where [Fei Xin] frowned as he looked at the surveillance footage.
1:12:3|1:12:6|[Officer Chen] tilted up the corners of his mouth behind him, looking even more confident.
1:12:6|1:12:11|The people coming in and out of the hotel and taking the elevator were all captured by the surveillance cameras.
1:12:11|1:12:14|And at this moment, he was walking in the parking lot carrying a large bag of firearms.
1:12:15|1:12:25|Approaching a car, [Fei Xin] inserted an iron ruler into the gap of the window, then easily opened the trunk, threw the bag in, and walked away.
1:12:25|1:12:33|At the hotel, [Fei Xin] stood at the door of room 307, holding a screenshot of the surveillance footage, rubbing the lower half of his face with his hand.
1:12:33|1:12:41|In the parking lot, Qiu Le pushes a shopping cart over, opens the trunk, and is about to put things in when he notices an extra bag.
1:12:41|1:12:44|He put down the things, unzipped the bag, revealing many firearms.
1:12:47|1:12:56|He quickly closed the trunk, scanned the surroundings with his eyes, then sat in the driver's seat, resting his hand against his lips, deep in thought.
1:13:27|1:13:35|Officer Chen turned around and looked at [Fei Xin], who was holding a photo and mimicking the person in the surveillance footage, walking from the room to the elevator.
1:13:35|1:13:38|Next, Officer Chen and others drove off to find [Qiu Le].
1:13:38|1:13:42|Several police cars drove past the main parking lot of [Qiu Le] on the street.
1:13:44|1:13:55|Two traffic police cars stopped on both sides of the intersection, signaling the approaching cars to stop, in order to ensure the police car transporting the captured criminals to pass through the intersection quickly and smoothly.
1:13:55|1:13:59|The police cars arrived and quickly cordoned off the parking lot with a police line.
1:13:59|1:14:9|Three snipers arrived at the underground parking lot, took the elevator, and as Officer Chen and others in bulletproof vests rushed to the roadside, a subordinate ran over with a tablet.
1:14:18|1:14:22|Police officers were stationed one after another, and pedestrians on the roadside stopped to watch Fei Xin and Qiu Le.
1:14:36|1:14:52|The police in the parking lot slowly approached [Qiu Le]'s car, while the helicopter above captured the situation on the ground. Dozens of police officers were seen moving quickly in the parking lot, one after another, all holding guns and using cars as cover.
1:14:52|1:15:1|Two police officers approached the sides of the car, with one opening the door and the other holding a gun as they moved closer, only to find [Qiu Le]'s phone on the driver's seat.
1:15:2|1:15:5|And [Qiu Le] is in the hallway not far away.
1:15:46|1:15:51|[Fei Xin] walked out of [Nan Fang]'s house and was photographed several times by [Qu Jian] hiding in the bushes.
1:16:0|1:16:5|The scene shifts to a shooting range, where [Fei Xin] moves the target to a far distance.
1:16:5|1:16:11|[Qiu Le] fired several shots, then changed the magazine and continued shooting, leaving bullet holes in the bullseye.
1:16:11|1:16:17|[Fei Xin] walked in, stood behind him, and took off his headphones.
1:17:5|1:17:8|[Fei Xin] grabbed Qiu Le and turned the gun towards him.
1:17:10|1:17:17|[Fei Xin] fiercely swung his hand, while [Qiu Le] stared at him in silence.
1:17:17|1:17:22|After speaking, [Qiu Le] turned and left the shooting range.
1:17:22|1:17:30|[Fei Xin] opened his mouth to say something as he watched his back recede, but in the end, he just sighed and walked over to the shooting window to press the button.
1:17:31|1:17:45|[Qiu Le] shot the board that moved over, leaned in to take a closer look, stuck his index finger in, only then did he realize that all he had just shot were food rings. It seemed like he had figured something out, as he rubbed his chin with his hand.
1:17:57|1:18:4|Thinking back to the time at the coffee shop with [Qiu Le], there was a man who looked very similar to [Qiu Le], who had once brushed past me.
1:18:5|1:18:34|Fei Xin took a look back and saw Tesla hiding behind the corner. Thinking about this, Fei Xin took out his phone and sent the photo of the man selling guns in the hotel to the Korean boss. Upon receiving the message, the Korean boss opened the photo and Fei Xin leaned back, cursing in Korean.
1:18:37|1:18:45|[Qiu Le], leaving the shooting range, walked in the alley at night, unaware that a Tesla with a hat on was following closely behind.
1:18:45|1:18:55|Qiu Le's brow furrowed slightly, Tesla maintained a certain distance, and the two walked around in this way, one in front and one behind, passing through this moonlit alley.
1:18:55|1:19:0|Later, when Huixin returned home, she saw someone sitting on the sofa.
1:19:0|1:19:4|He first paused for a moment, then lifted the corners of his mouth and said.
1:19:19|1:19:22|[Fei Xin] walks up the stairs, feeling the dog on the stairs.
1:19:24|1:19:30|In the moment of bending down and standing up, [Fei Xin] noticed a bottle of wine on the table next to the sofa.
1:19:30|1:19:36|As she walked up the stairs, [Qiu Le] glanced sideways, and at that moment Tang Chan rushed in through the door, shouting.
1:19:38|1:19:43|Fei Xin ran downstairs, only to be slapped by Tang Chan as soon as she reached the bottom.
1:20:6|1:20:11|Tang Chan gave [Fei Xin] a fierce look before turning and walking out the door.
1:20:11|1:20:18|[Fei Xin] wrinkled her nose in confusion, then ran out the door. However, she didn't go after Tang Chan, but went to the hospital.
1:20:18|1:20:31|She pushed open the door with sunglasses on, ignoring the waiting pregnant women's gaze. After adjusting her glasses, she put her hands in her pockets and pushed open the door of the obstetrics and gynecology doctor's office without hesitation.
1:20:31|1:20:32|"Go in," asked [Doctor].
1:20:35|1:20:45|[Fei Xin] sat down, the doctor in front of him didn't even lift his head. Then he took off his cold glasses and put them on the table, stroking his chin, as if the surroundings were all magically forbidden.
1:22:27|1:22:30|[The doctor] stood up and walked over to him.
1:22:44|1:22:59|[Fei Xin] sat on the chair, turned his head up, and the [Doctor] also followed by bowing his head. After the two of them made a kissing gesture, [Fei Xin] walked out of the office, while the [Doctor] happily stood in place waving his arms.
1:22:59|1:23:5|The scene shifts to a small path, with the boss of the Korean gang walking at the front, rubbing his stomach and speaking.
1:23:21|1:23:26|The Korean boss's phone vibrated, and he took it out to see, calling out Tesla's name.
1:23:26|1:23:29|His subordinates gathered around him as he flipped to the next photo.
1:23:33|1:23:37|The Korean boss pushed his men back the way they came.
1:23:37|1:23:40|The scene cuts to [Fei Xin], who walks into his house and takes off his coat.
1:23:53|1:23:57|Later they got divorced.
1:24:5|1:24:9|After the treatment, [Fei Xin] finally gave birth to a son.
1:24:15|1:24:20|Until he had a daughter, he believed the child was not his.
1:24:39|1:24:40|[Fei Xin] took a sip of wine.
1:25:16|1:25:20|It turns out that Fei Xin just put something in the drink and then shook it.
1:25:20|1:25:23|He forcefully looked at [Fei Xin].
1:25:40|1:25:47|Tesla's eyes were already a bit unfocused, and his body swayed and staggered towards the ground.
1:25:47|1:25:50|[Fei Xin] walked over and squatted down, patting his arm.
1:25:58|1:26:1|Fei Xin's dog is also barking at Tesla.
1:26:1|1:26:7|In a flash, [Fei Xin] tied Tesla's wrists with a rope, and then tied his feet together.
1:26:7|1:26:10|Then he picked up his coat and walked out the door.
1:26:10|1:26:14|The scene shifts to an underground parking garage, in front of a lit-up identifier.
1:26:14|1:26:20|[Fei Xin] keeps his eyes fixed ahead, then enters the password at the elevator entrance.
1:26:20|1:26:23|He pushed open the door, hands in his pockets, and walked step by step to the front of the car.
1:26:24|1:26:28|The headlights turned on, and the satellite crawled out of the car towards the exit.
1:26:28|1:26:34|After making a turn, Fei Xin, who had just started driving, collided head-on with another car.
1:26:37|1:26:43|On the other side, [Qu Jian] reversed the car, then drove forward and crashed into it again fiercely.
1:26:43|1:27:0|Ou Jian's movements were swift and decisive, clearly well-prepared. [Fei Xin] tapped the accelerator again, but Ou Jian suddenly reversed and retreated, preparing to move forward. This time, [Fei Xin] reacted quickly and also stepped on the gas pedal, causing their cars to collide violently.
1:27:8|1:27:14|Ou Jian picked up the control stick and got out of the car.
1:27:14|1:27:20|He walked up to Fei Xin's car and started smashing it fiercely, poking at the windows.
1:27:48|1:27:54|After circling the car several times, Qiu Le suddenly paused, and the baseball bat in his hand fell to the ground.
1:27:54|1:28:0|Just as [Fei Xin] took a breath, Ou Jian pulled out a gun from the car and aimed it at [Fei Xin], pulling the trigger.
1:28:0|1:28:6|Suddenly, a figure flew out between the two, reminding Fei Xin of the scene where the boy was shooting during the performance of "Wind and Rain".
1:28:6|1:28:9|However, this time, the playing cards on the wall were splattered with blood.
1:28:9|1:28:14|Fei Xin looked down and saw Qiu Le clutching his chest and falling to the ground, he rushed over.
1:29:15|1:29:17|The flashback ends, [Qiu Le] sits up.
1:29:29|1:29:34|Xie Tianyou stole the Korean's gun and set up a trap to lure you into committing a crime.
1:29:36|1:29:41|[Fei Xin] patted Qiu Le on the shoulder, and the three of them returned to Fei Xin's home.
1:29:46|1:29:48|[Fei Xin] pulled Qiu Le to the computer.
1:29:51|1:29:56|[Fei Xin] leaned on the table with one hand and on the chair with the other, watching Qu Jian operate the keyboard.
1:29:56|1:30:0|A pop-up box appeared on the screen as he waited and spoke.
1:30:9|1:30:12|[Qiu Le] came down from the second floor and also moved closer to the side.
1:30:12|1:30:16|Ou Jian curved his fingers, placed them in front of his lips, and furrowed his brow.
1:30:16|1:30:19|At this moment, his phone vibrated.
1:30:19|1:30:21|He took out his phone and saw that it was a call from Fei Xin from the Engineering Department.
1:30:31|1:30:34|Ou Jian quickly typed on the keyboard and then explained.
1:31:18|1:31:36|The scene shifts to a wedding show venue, with several big brothers at the front clapping their hands. Two models in wedding dresses are showcasing on the stage, followed by models in bikinis, dresses, and traditional Chinese-style wedding dresses constantly appearing on stage. The lights are flashing at the scene, creating a very lively atmosphere.
1:31:36|1:31:44|The big brother in the audience has been enthusiastically supporting the show, holding flowers in both hands and waving to the models on stage.
1:31:44|1:31:49|At this moment, [Qiu Le], who arrived at the scene, was hiding behind the curtain in the dressing room, secretly observing.
1:31:49|1:31:55|Shen Jiamei's husband and a henchman sat on the side, while Shen Jiamei walked up behind a model who was getting her makeup done.
1:32:2|1:32:4|[Shen Jiamei] heard the sound and turned to get her clothes.
1:32:7|1:32:14|Continuing, she then returned with a headscarf to the model who was getting makeup done, while her husband walked over with two cellphones in hand.
1:32:14|1:32:17|The scene cuts back to Fei Xin's home.
1:33:1|1:33:2|Until she passed away.
1:33:24|1:33:27|[Fei Xin] looked at the message received from the inventor Tesla.
1:33:27|1:33:28|He looked at the next page of Edison again.
1:34:42|1:35:1|Just as Ou Jian pressed the Enter key, [Qiu Le] pulled the circuit breaker on site.
1:35:1|1:35:12|Tesla looked at the phone in confusion, while [Fei Xin] and [Qiu Le] watched as the countdown stopped at three seconds and cheered.
1:35:12|1:35:17|The two of them breathed a sigh of relief, while the people on the scene looked at the countdown interface on their phones with confusion.
1:35:22|1:35:37|[Ou Jian]'s phone received a message. He picked it up and saw a video of [Nan Fang] and a child being kidnapped in the back seat of a car. [Nan Fang]'s hands were tied to the car's roof handle, while the child was placed in a safety seat. The video was sent by Tesla, and [Ou Jian] answered the call.
1:35:59|1:36:1|The car is about to fall down.
1:37:13|1:37:16|Han's subordinates never seem to come in.
1:37:16|1:37:22|The scene shifts to [Qu Jian], who is driving a Tesla and talking on the phone.
1:37:43|1:37:45|Tesla responded over there.
1:37:58|1:38:14|[Fei Xin] was at home looking at the books on the bookshelf. He took down a book on complexity thinking, flipped to a page, circled the title of the Barnum effect, quickly glanced at it, then put his hand on his chin and started thinking, before sitting down on a chair.
1:38:19|1:38:20|He pressed the Enter key directly, and the countdown stopped.
1:38:41|1:38:55|Tesla put away his phone and turned to leave. [Fei Xin] also picked up his phone and prepared to rush to the scene. The scene was chaotic at this moment. Tesla walked up to one of Han Guo's men, who was stunned. But he looked at Qiu Le and said.
1:38:57|1:39:2|The people on the scene were looking at two identical individuals.
1:39:7|1:39:11|Tesla reached out to block, and the two began to spar.
1:39:11|1:39:19|[Nan Fang] over there, the machine is still controlling the car to move forward. He in the car shook his head back, and suddenly woke up.
1:39:19|1:39:28|[Nan Fang] glanced at the child next to him, struggling. He looked at his bound wrists, then at the child, leaned in, and used his teeth to untie the rope.
1:39:29|1:39:34|On the way, the car was clearly out of control, starting to sway from side to side.
1:39:34|1:39:38|After several attempts, [Fei Xin] finally broke free from the restraints.
1:39:38|1:39:52|He quickly leaned forward, gripping the steering wheel, but to no avail as the steering wheel had no response. Anxiously, he pushed the steering wheel, sat back in the rear seat, tears streaming down his face, feeling helpless.
1:39:52|1:39:56|On the scene, the two men were arguing and fighting, while Officer Chen arrived with his team.
1:40:8|1:40:18|Officer Chen saw [Qiu Le] and the Tesla in the middle, both of them looking at him without saying a word. Officer Chen felt a bit confused, he turned to look at his subordinates, then turned back and spoke.
1:40:22|1:40:27|The scene cuts back to [Nan Fang], who is attempting to remove the safety seat.
1:40:27|1:40:31|At this moment, the speed of the car has reached 90 kilometers per hour.
1:40:31|1:40:37|With the car rapidly approaching the overpass, he finally remembered to pull the release lever on the side of the driver's seat.
1:40:37|1:40:41|Then quickly take off the coat and bring it to the safety seat.
1:40:41|1:40:50|In a critical moment, [Fei Xin] held onto the safety seat and jumped out of the car, rolling on the ground for a few rounds, while the car also plunged off the overpass.
1:40:50|1:40:57|[Nan Fang]'s limbs were all scraped from rolling, but he didn't care about that. Instead, he quickly checked on the child in the safety seat.
1:40:57|1:41:4|Fortunately, after opening the coat, the child was unharmed. [Nan Fang] excitedly and with a still trembling hand, touched the child's face.
1:41:4|1:41:9|Then he held the child in his arms, shivering, and burst into tears of excitement.
1:41:9|1:41:13|The man's face is dirty and covered in scars.
1:41:13|1:41:18|He sat on the elevated bridge, holding the child and crying loudly to the sky.
1:41:18|1:41:26|The sky, just after the rain, gradually brightened. Under the overpass, the out-of-control car flipped over completely on the ground, and [Qu Jian] finally arrived by car.
1:41:27|1:41:37|He looked at the overturned car on the ground, stiffly opened the car door and got out, moving slowly towards it, his body swaying as if he could collapse at any moment.
1:41:37|1:41:52|Just as he was about to approach the car, he suddenly stopped in his tracks, the sound of his breathing out of control. Then he slightly turned his body and quickly walked to the side of the car, leaning against it to take a look. After that, he knelt down on the ground, exhaling heavily, tilting his head to the side.
1:41:55|1:42:1|The sorrowful emotion surged in his heart as he not only lost his wife, but also his child.
1:42:1|1:42:10|After some mental preparation, he blinked his eyes, as if forcing himself to accept it, looked into the car, and softly called out a title that he hadn't used in a long time.
1:43:6|1:43:11|He carefully touched the child.
1:43:11|1:43:14|The two stood under the overpass, looking at the child in their arms.
1:43:14|1:43:18|The sky at this moment has completely cleared up, with the sunlight shimmering brightly.
1:43:19|1:43:29|Ou Jian firmly stopped [Nan Fang], who finally burst into tears in his arms. Both of them shed tears, and the long-standing misunderstanding was finally resolved.
1:43:29|1:43:40|Just as they embraced and let go, [Fei Xin] and [Qiu Le] drove up, got out of the car, and watched the scene of reconciliation across from them, leaning against the car with a smile on their faces.
1:43:40|1:44:0|[Fei Xin] rested his arm on [Qiu Le]'s shoulder, while [Qiu Le] raised an eyebrow at [Fei Xin]. [Fei Xin] leaned in and bumped heads with him, then patted his leg before turning his head and noticing the cat perched on the electric bike by the roadside.
1:44:0|1:44:2|[Fei Xin] leads the way, with [Qiu Le] following closely behind.
1:44:25|1:44:29|The film ends here, thank you for listening.
1:44:29|1:44:32|At the end of the film, a post-credits scene will be shown.
1:44:32|1:44:40|Fei Xin's Tesla was blocked by Qiu Le's men. Qiu Le, the boss of the Korean gang, got out of the car, walked over, lowered his sunglasses, took a look, and burst into laughter.
1:44:40|1:44:54|Patting the belly of the Tesla, then taking out a razor and waving it twice, turning to look at [Fei Xin] leaning against the car, [Fei Xin] then thumbs up, the Korean boss with the knife shaved towards the eyebrow of the Tesla.
1:44:54|1:45:4|When he put down his hand, half of Tesla's eyebrows were shaved off. He leaned his arm on Tesla's shoulder, lowered his sunglasses, and looked at [Fei Xin], now both of them were missing eyebrows.
1:45:6|1:45:12|A week later, Fei Xin is playing table tennis at home, with a life-size cardboard cutout of the Korean boss across from him. He answers the phone.
1:45:28|1:45:36|[Fei Xin] nodded, only to see the Korean boss on the other side take off his sunglasses, his eyebrows finally growing out, which made [Fei Xin] smile.
1:46:47|1:47:2|The clown danced in the cheap graveyard, with the opera echoing in the clock tower.
