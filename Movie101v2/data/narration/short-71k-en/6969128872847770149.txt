0:3:23|0:3:40|[Yuan Xiaowen] listened while flipping through a bag containing clothes, then placed it on the table. The man pointed outside the door, [Yuan Xiaowen] glanced around and followed. The staff around the fuselage were still busy. [Yuan Xiaowen] climbed up the severed part of the fuselage with the man, holding the man's wrist and walking inside.
0:3:40|0:3:48|The man turned on the lights, [Yuan Xiaowen] quickened his pace, and the man shone the lights on the ground, walking quickly towards the staff members inspecting outside the cockpit.
0:3:48|0:4:14|The man raised the lamp, shining it on the worker in protective clothing testing the handheld nuclear explosion device inside the DC-8 aircraft. The dim yellow light fell on [Yuan Xiaowen]'s face as she left the aircraft and walked towards the nearby car. She took off her hat, removed her sunglasses, and tapped on the tablet in front of the co-pilot's seat. In the office, senior Chinese government official [Song An] in Beijing reviewed the on-site photos brought back by [Yuan Xiaowen].
0:4:16|0:4:25|The two are having a meeting, and the man raises the notebook in his hand, on which a zero is drawn.
0:4:34|0:4:59|[Song An] turned the chair and stood up, taking off the coat hanging on the hanger. Assistant Xiao Zhang opened the door for him. As [Song An] walked, he said to Xiao Zhang, arriving at a construction site in the outskirts of South Korea. Three huge chimneys were emitting smoke, which mixed with the clouds and dispersed outward. The factory, orderly lit with yellow lights, was filled with the sound of machines clanking.
0:4:59|0:5:16|In the scene, [Jin Taonian] in protective gear walks casually towards the hostage worker. Two henchmen hold guns aimed at the workers kneeling on the ground. [Jin Taonian] looks indifferent and stops, saying:
0:5:23|0:5:57|[Jin Taonian] shot in the head, the staff kneeling down. [Jin Taonian] waved his hand, and the staff, gasping for breath, approached. They were pushed down by his henchmen, trembling as they searched the pockets of the just-killed staff, and finally pulled out a key. The henchmen immediately walked up with guns in hand.
0:5:57|0:6:25|Pushing him towards the control panel, trembling as he typed on the keyboard, a series of codes appeared on the screen. With the rotation of the storage platform, the door opened. The staff member held a key and inserted it into the lock, twisting it in the same direction with both hands. The alert red light shone on [Jin Taonian]'s face. He stared straight ahead without looking away, the raw material ball was on the storage platform. A gloved hand pulled out the device storing the raw material ball.
0:6:25|0:6:48|White gas is emerging around. [Jin Taonian] is standing outside the door, with his henchman holding a gun beside him, observing sideways. Inside, the henchmen are putting four raw material balls into the toolbox, then taking out other devices, carefully repeating this action. The rest of the staff are crouching on both sides of the aisle. [Jin Taonian] walks out while taking off his gas mask, and his two henchmen behind him shoot the workers one by one.
0:6:49|0:7:20|Turning to the side of the road in South Korea, the person waiting outside the car raised his arm to look at his watch. Inside the car, someone spoke to the co-pilot, and another person ran to the side of [Park Yuzhe]. [Park Yuzhe] stood with his hands in his pockets, thought for a moment, then turned around. The person next to him looked towards the busy hotel staff behind them. A man in a suit quickly walked towards the guest seats.
0:7:20|0:7:29|Approaching the lady walking towards him, he bowed slightly and joined a group of ladies who were playing with the child [Fan Jiaming] in the arms of the hostess [Shan Lan].
0:7:32|0:7:37|Grandma took [Fan Jiaming] with a smile, teasing him with her mouth.
0:7:38|0:7:54|Yoon Hee-shan helped [Fan Jiaming] walk out towards the living room. Outside, Deputy Director of the South Korean National Intelligence Service [Cui Minho] was secretly operating his phone. When her husband [Cui Minho] heard the sound, he turned to look at Yoon Hee-shan approaching and quickly stuffed the phone into his pocket.
0:8:9|0:8:26|[Park Yuzhe] walked towards the banquet hall with two people, trying to open the door for them. Upon seeing [Park Yuzhe], Yin Xishan's expression immediately changed, and she looked towards her husband [Park Yuzhe] as he passed through the guests. Yin Xishan then walked down from the stage.
0:8:26|0:8:32|[Cui Minho] carried [Fan Jiaming] down and handed the crying [Fan Jiaming] to his mother who came over, the mother took [Fan Jiaming] and comforted him.
0:8:56|0:9:18|[Cui Minho] pursed his lips and turned to face Yin Xishan, who also looked at him as they stepped outside. [Cui Minho] gave [Fan Jiaming] a kiss on the cheek, while their mother looked on with a kind smile. Yin Xishan stood by them with his back turned, [Cui Minho] handed [Fan Jiaming] over to their mother's embrace. [Cui Minho] walked over to Yin Xishan, who stood alone in the wind, tears held back with gritted teeth. With a solemn expression, [Cui Minho] called out to him.
0:9:18|0:9:36|The wind blew through Yin Xishan's hair as she turned to [Cui Minho]. [Cui Minho] furrowed his brow, took a deep breath through his nose, and Yin Xishan lowered her head to hold her husband's hand.
0:9:46|0:10:9|[Cui Minho] patted Yin Xishan's hand, nodded, and turned towards the towering skyscrapers of Hong Kong. Everything in the city was running calmly and orderly. A truck was unloading a large container, with the words "Hazardous Material Handling Container" printed on the container. Two workers wearing safety helmets approached the container door. Wrapped in yellow protective suits, the workers were cleaning barrels containing hazardous materials.
0:10:9|0:10:16|Scooping white granules into the bucket, Zhao Zhiren is followed by many people queuing up to enter the tent for cleaning. In the crowd, [Li Yanming] is...
0:10:16|0:10:24|Two personnel in protective suits are supporting a person lying on the ground, often using scissors to directly cut off his short sleeves and put on a white cape.
0:10:26|0:10:52|Here, the police are recording information of the people in line and packing their clothes in black bags to put into the boxes. Two police cars drive over, and [Li Yanming] and other officers with badges get out of the cars and walk towards the steps. [Li Yanming] takes off his earphones and puts them in his pocket as he walks. Below the steps, naked people are being cleaned in makeshift tents. [Li Yanming] and others pass by a transparent tent with a sign asking to put the cloaks in the box.
0:10:52|0:11:8|Approaching Zhao Zhiren, who is taking off his gas mask, Zhao Zhiren looks up, frowning, at Li Yanming. He takes out his binoculars, puts them on, looks at his chest plate, and then looks up.
0:11:15|0:11:21|[Zhao Zhiren] looked at [Li Yanming] with his mouth slightly open as two police cars passed by the intersection. Inside the car, [Zhao Zhiren] asked.
0:12:18|0:12:40|[Zhao Zhiren] smiled and straightened his chest, opened the documents in his hand. By the dark coast, a plane with landing lights flew towards the land. The ticket inspector checked the passport, put the ticket inside, and handed it to [Zhang Yijun] waiting outside the window. Behind her, [Jin Taonian's Godmother] pointed ahead and followed. [Jin Taonian's Godmother] smiled and said something to [Zhang Yijun] before walking to the window.
0:12:42|0:13:9|Handing over the passport, [Zhao Zhiren] resumed his cold expression and looked towards [Zhang Yijun]. Through the airplane window, several black cars with flashing police lights approached. Several people in military uniforms were waiting. The cars stopped between them and the airplane, and [Cui Minho] watched as they got out of the car with documents in hand. [Park Yuzhe] from the back car also got out and walked over.
0:13:14|0:13:32|The shorter soldier said, two black cars, followed by a black car with flashing lights, the drivers and co-pilots of the front and back cars quickly got out, [Cui Minho] slightly opened his mouth, everyone walked over there, the driver opened the door, and the person getting off the car was none other than the Director of the South Korean National Intelligence Service, [Kim Hae-sook].
0:13:47|0:13:54|[Jin Haishu] gestured with her hand behind her, then turned around and led everyone forward.
0:14:33|0:14:46|[Cui Minho] and [Park Yuzhe] nodded in understanding, the plane glided into the air and took off, its anti-collision lights flashing into the darkness. Arriving in Hong Kong, the police officers greeted [Li Yanming], who was helping [Zhao Zhiren] down the steps, and then said to [Zhao Zhiren]:
0:14:47|0:15:19|[Zhao Zhiren] patted his inner pocket, put down the items, walked through the security gate, but the alarm went off. The officer stopped him, scanned with a scanner, [Zhao Zhiren] raised his hands in cooperation. The officer gestured for him to pass, [Zhao Zhiren] walked towards the front desk, where an officer handed him a pass card. [Zhao Zhiren] took the pass card and hung it around his neck. [Li Yanming] raised the hand holding the file to signal forward, [Zhao Zhiren] followed behind him, and the left side just inside the door was filled with surveillance screens.
0:15:19|0:15:43|In the middle of the office desk, officers are busy working. A round table in the center is separated by glass. [Li Yanming] leads [Zhao Zhiren] through the busy colleagues. [Zhao Zhiren] walks while observing around. The intelligence center is not decorated, but the simple cement walls are filled with secrets. The two arrive at the round table, and the sensor door opens automatically as they step up the stairs. The person who is talking turns his head to look at them and nods. [Li Yanming] introduces the person next to him, saying,
0:16:29|0:16:35|[Li Yanming] turned to look at [Zhao Zhiren] and [Zhao Zhiren] sighed and replied:
0:17:50|0:18:13|After listening to [Zhao Zhiren]'s words, the people present couldn't help but look at each other with lowered eyes, realizing that the situation might be much more serious than they had imagined. On the other side, [Jin Taonian's Godmother] stood in front of a huge floor-to-ceiling window, wearing a vest. She smoked a cigarette while looking at the night view of Hong Kong outside the window. This was a luxurious hotel room with bright and clean glass windows.
0:18:13|0:18:19|Reflecting the dazzling lights of Victoria Harbour. Outside the window, above the clouds,
0:18:44|0:19:8|In the hotel room, [Jin Taonian], with scars on his back and arms, carefully stares at the portable nuclear device. He steadily holds the specialized handle, lifts the raw material sphere cautiously, then uses both hands to accurately install it into the portable nuclear device. After the raw material sphere is connected to the device and the handle is removed, listening to the two dripping sounds, [Jin Taonian]'s face becomes solemn.
0:19:8|0:19:10|Finally, a relieved smile appeared on [Zhao Zhiren]'s face.
0:19:10|0:19:18|On the other side, [Cui Minho] and [Park Yuzhe] have just arrived at the airport. They are getting off the plane and preparing to go through security checks.
0:19:18|0:19:28|Smoothly passing through the security check, the Hong Kong side has been waiting for a long time.
0:19:29|0:19:35|The person in charge of receiving them handed the simultaneous interpreter to them and said,
0:19:49|0:19:56|[Fan Jiaming] didn't say much, after a brief introduction, he led a few people away. Late at night, on the deserted airport expressway, three police cars were speeding along.
0:20:28|0:20:56|Several people drove to the scene. The gaps between the buildings in Hong Kong were very small. Although it was called a street, it was more like an alley. At the same time, Jin Taonian and Zhang Yijun had already arrived at the trading location. Jin Taonian was driving a motorcycle with Zhang Yijun sitting on the back. After a gust of wind, the two entered an underground parking lot. As they entered, the seller's men who were watching at the entrance placed a sign saying "Parking Full" at the garage door.
0:20:56|0:21:16|When the convoy of [Fan Jiaming] and his team drove near Dexing Street, the narrow street was already filled with police cars. Countless police lights were flashing continuously, and all the officers involved in the operation were busy with their tasks. The officer in charge of summarizing the situation walked back to the command vehicle.
0:21:18|0:21:24|After that, he returned to his position and continued working.
0:21:49|0:22:22|[Shen Meijing] smiled, while on the other side of the underground parking lot, [Jin Taonian] and another person rode a motorcycle all the way to the trading point deep in the garage. A group of burly and fierce foreign men stared at the two as they stopped the motorcycle. [Jin Taonian] met their fierce gaze without any fear. He parked the vehicle, took off his helmet, and looked around at the surrounding people with the same fierce eyes. The air in the underground parking lot became extremely tense as the two sides of the trade tested each other like this.
0:22:22|0:22:32|After a while, [Jin Taonian] got off the motorcycle, put away his helmet, and walked over to the table and chairs in front of them, sitting down in a relaxed manner.
0:22:32|0:22:44|Both sides had no intention of speaking, and the situation became tense for a moment. It wasn't until [Zhang Yijun] on the motorcycle took off her helmet and sat across from [Jin Taonian] that the foreigner threw away the tissue.
0:23:10|0:23:51|[Jin Taonian] looked at him expressionlessly, slightly nodded his head, and then a foreign henchman walked towards [Zhang Yijun] to prepare for a body search. Faced with a foreign man who was nearly a head taller than her, [Zhang Yijun] showed no fear. She tilted her head, took off her backpack and threw it on the ground. The foreign man then began the search. At first, the man was operating in an orderly manner, but when he saw [Zhang Yijun] who remained motionless and extremely obedient during the search, his mind started to become more active.
0:23:51|0:24:15|He gently felt up [Zhang Yijun]'s calf, and just as he was about to touch the base of her thigh, [Zhang Yijun] pressed hard on the man's back with a knee strike, followed by a series of quick punches, knocking the man down. She twisted his arm and was about to draw a dagger to kill him when [Jin Taonian] shouted to stop. Like a machine, [Zhang Yijun] immediately stopped the fatal blow, tilting her head slightly.
0:24:15|0:24:28|Looking at the foreign buyer who just stopped [Zhang Yijun]'s [Jin Taonian], also used the threat in his hand to threaten the buyer, and stuffed the detonator of the rest of his men into his arms, then took out a handheld computer and handed it to the buyer to signal him to transfer money.
0:25:19|0:25:38|The armed forces of the police quickly went into action. At the entrance of the garage, a small car drove in first, followed by six fully armed police officers with riot shields. This scene was captured by the buyers' men sitting in the control room, who then aimed their guns and started shooting at the incoming car.
0:25:41|0:25:52|The foreign henchmen protect their boss and retreat, [Jin Taonian] exchanges glances with [Zhang Yijun], a fierce battle ensues, a police officer gets injured, his companion holds him while two others continue to engage.
0:25:56|0:26:5|The first group of 6 police officers who rushed into the garage were fiercely attacked by the enemy. Upon hearing the news, [Fan Jiaming] in the car outside immediately couldn't sit still. He jumped out of the car and started walking while taking off his suit jacket.
0:26:20|0:26:40|In a moment of urgency, [Fan Jiaming] did not want to continue engaging with them, ordering the officers to keep an eye on them. However, [Cui Minho] and the others insisted on joining the operation, and were eventually stopped by the officers on site. At the entrance of the garage, [Fan Jiaming] crouched down to shoot and repel the thugs inside, while the officers behind him quickly rushed in.
0:26:48|0:27:8|[Fan Jiaming] also sneaked into the tunnel of the convoy, crouching down to shoot. He hit the enemy's exposed calf, causing the enemy to lose balance and fall out of cover. [Fan Jiaming] then directly shot the enemy in the back of the head, killing him. With the guard at the garage door eliminated, [Fan Jiaming] took the opportunity to lead the team into the depths of the garage.
0:27:12|0:27:29|A team of police officers has already entered the garage and engaged the enemy in gunfire. Another team is continuously entering from other entrances of the garage. Intense gunshots are constantly echoing in every corner of the garage. A police officer shouts at the enemy, who is approaching him with a gun. He has no choice but to shoot and kill the enemy.
0:27:29|0:27:52|In front of well-equipped and accurate shooting Hong Kong police officers, the enemies are no match at all. They can only rely on firepower to engage with the officers. On the other hand, [Jin Taonian] and others are in a completely different situation. He aims in a direction, pulls the trigger, and flies straight towards the officers in combat. Hidden in the dark, he leans against the glass of several vehicles and still accurately kills the officers behind the cars. [Zhang Yijun] withstands the bullets from the police,
0:27:56|0:28:14|Hiding behind the wall with a micro-uzi in hand, [Zhang Yijun] quickly fired a burst of bullets, forcing the pair of police officers in front to retreat. She then hid back behind the wall and dragged a body next to her to throw it outside the cover. Finally, she used the body on the ground as a shield, lying down and continuing to shoot at the police officers in front. [Fan Jiaming] peeked out to assess the situation.
0:28:16|0:28:41|[Fan Jiaming] rushed into the scene and saw this tragic sight. He angrily exchanged fire with [Zhang Yijun], continuously shooting at the corpse, causing blood and flesh to fly. This forced [Zhang Yijun] back behind the wall. Enraged, [Zhang Yijun] forcefully pulled out the pins of several grenades, rolling them along the ground towards the underside of a vehicle.
0:28:41|0:29:2|A huge fire was ignited, the car rolled and was blasted out. [Fan Jiaming] propped up a car and jumped up, narrowly avoiding the explosion. [Zhang Yijun] sought revenge, she killed the foreign man who had just harassed her with a knife, then casually took usable clothing, disguised herself and left the garage. The residual firepower was still shooting, meanwhile.
0:29:2|0:29:11|The buyer boss has run out of men, sneaked onto a car himself, and tried to escape in the midst of gunfire, crashing into several cars one after another.
0:29:12|0:29:19|On the other side of the garage outside Dexin Street, the police are evacuating the crowd, and the disguised [Zhang Yijun] is leaving among the crowd.
0:29:19|0:29:42|Outside, the police officers have laid out spike strips at each checkpoint. The buyer boss, in a panic, rushes out of the garage and runs directly over the spike strips. The tires are instantly punctured, causing the vehicle to lose control and crash to a stop on the side of the road. The buyer boss, surrounded by numerous police officers, then fights like a trapped beast, picking up a gun and frantically pulling the trigger, shooting at the officers outside the window.
0:29:42|0:29:48|A police officer was shot and fell to the ground, and [Cui Minho] and others quickly administered emergency treatment to him.
0:29:48|0:30:12|[Park Yuzhe], under the eye signal from [Cui Minho], picked up the weapon dropped by the injured officer. With a quick flip, [Park Yuzhe] dodged the shots from the buyer's boss, then crouched down and aimed to shoot. In one go, four shots hit the buyer's boss, causing him to lose balance and fall out of the car. At the same time, a car drove out from the car wash in the garage. The battle was not over yet, just as [Jin Taonian] was fighting with the officer.
0:30:14|0:30:39|The car drove towards the police officers who were in combat. One officer, who was knocked down by the foreign leader's tail whip, bravely got up and sprinted to climb onto the leader's car window. The leader, with one hand, controlled the officer who was about to shoot. The officer was dragged on the ground, sliding all the way. The ruthless leader directly controlled the angle and fiercely slammed the officer against the side of a wrecked car. Watching as even the helmet was overturned.
0:30:39|0:30:54|The fallen police officer, just climbed out of the scrap car pile, [Fan Jiaming], swiftly turned the car around with a drift, fired a shot at the car's rear, continued to fire several shots, still only hitting the car body, then chased and fired several shots?
0:30:54|0:31:10|A shot hit the leader's head, followed by a loud noise. The people squatting outside looked up, and an out-of-control car came crashing down from the building, shattering the neon sign above. The front of the car, affected by gravity, plummeted straight down and then bounced back up, creating a vacuum on the ground.
0:31:12|0:31:37|At this moment, [Jin Taonian] rode out of the parking lot on a motorcycle, firing continuously with one hand. The crowd quickly ducked for cover. [Park Yuzhe], who was at the entrance of the parking lot, picked up a gun but found it had no bullets. He then hurriedly ran towards a parked police motorcycle and started it to chase after. [Cui Minho] and [Shen Meijing] were caught off guard, watching him with astonishment. [Jin Taonian] turned at the T-junction and sped forward, overtaking two cars, attracting the attention of passersby.
0:31:37|0:31:41|[Park Yuzhe] chased after him with all his might, keeping a close eye on him.
0:31:41|0:32:5|[Jin Taonian] noticed the sound behind him, turned around to see two people following, [Jin Taonian] passed through the footbridge in the middle of the road, and soon [Park Yuzhe] followed suit. [Jin Taonian] calmly crossed the next street, while [Park Yuzhe] had closed the distance with him. [Jin Taonian] glanced sideways, picked up the pace, crossed the distant overpass, and could see the two about to enter a three-lane road in the opposite direction. [Jin Taonian] occasionally looked back, keeping an eye on [Park Yuzhe] behind him.
0:32:7|0:32:26|Flexibly weaving through the cars on the side of the road and in the middle of the road, [Park Yuzhe] grits his teeth and stares ahead, only to be left behind again. Fuming silently, he opens his mouth in a furious roar. [Jin Taonian] keeps changing positions among the cars with high beams on, while [Park Yuzhe] relentlessly follows from behind. The two motorcycles chasing each other through the crowded mountain area attract the attention of passersby.
0:32:26|0:32:46|[Jin Taonian] drove into a sparsely populated road, swerving suddenly to the right at the intersection where he was supposed to turn left. A taxi on the side of the road was just starting to move, and upon seeing the incoming car, immediately honked the horn. In a hurry to dodge the car, [Jin Taonian] flipped to the side and fell forward. He quickly hugged his arms and legs to cushion the impact as he slid forward. The motorcycle crashed into the vending kiosk on the side of the road, with [Park Yuzhe] following closely behind.
0:32:46|0:33:7|Jumping off the motorcycle, [Park Yuzhe] ran forward to check, but found no sign of [Jin Taonian]. Only the police motorcycle's lights were flashing. [Park Yuzhe] stomped his feet in anger, swung his arm, took a deep breath, and turned around, only to notice the handbag dropped on the ground. There was a bullet hole on the pipa. [Park Yuzhe] took out his phone, frowned, and waited for the call to connect, pursing his lips.
0:33:10|0:33:28|After finishing speaking, he raised his hand to rub his eyes and nodded. The night turned into day, and the helicopter rotated its rotor blades in the sky, heading towards the sky.
0:33:28|0:33:48|Park Yuzhe on the ground took two black boxes from the trunk and walked towards a car. Cui Minho and Shen Meijing had also arrived by the car. Just as the iron curtain was pulled open, Cui Minho took out a toolbox and walked towards Park Yuzhe, looking at Shen Meijing, then nodded at Park Yuzhe. Park Yuzhe responded that he was ready. The three of them looked ahead at the spot where the purse had dropped last night.
0:33:48|0:34:16|Surrounded by sandbags, in the helicopter above, [Zhao Zhiren], along with [Li Yanming], overlook the ground where [Cui Minho] and two others walk into the center of the sandbags. [Park Yuzhe] hands a box to [Shen Meijing], and the three gather around the briefcase, squatting down. They open the box, hands in rubber gloves, taking out instruments. [Park Yuzhe] is ready, saying to [Cui Minho]:
0:34:25|0:34:47|Shen Meijing scanned the briefcase and showed it to Cui Minho. Cui Minho nodded, while Park Yuzhe held the pliers for support. Cui Minho inserted the device into the bullet hole on the briefcase and observed the data on the device in his hand.
0:34:51|0:34:58|Took out the instrument and put it in the box, nodded at [Park Yuzhe], who was holding pliers in one hand and scissors in the other to cut open the bag.
0:35:2|0:35:11|On the helicopter, Li Yanming said, Zhao Zhiren looked out the window and then turned back.
0:36:23|0:36:32|[Li Yanming] lowered his head in thought, then looked at [Zhao Zhiren]. After [Zhao Zhiren] met his gaze, he nodded.
0:36:39|0:36:48|[Cui Minho] nodded as he watched the helicopter in the sky, and the three of them began the confirmation process. [Cui Minho] operated on the tablet, and numbers appeared on the handheld nuclear device.
0:36:54|0:37:21|[Park Yuzhe] looked at [Shen Meijing], each took out two chips from a card box and stuck them on the handheld nuclear detonator. The handheld nuclear detonator scanned the chips from left to right and then from top to bottom. After the scan, [Park Yuzhe] removed the chip carefully, and [Shen Meijing] followed suit, putting it back in his pocket. [Park Yuzhe] cautiously lifted the cover of the handheld nuclear detonator with both hands, while [Cui Minho] tightened his gloves and leaned forward.
0:37:21|0:37:34|Both [Park Yuzhe] and [Cui Minho] picked up the tablet as they twisted their hands in opposite directions at both ends of the handheld nuclear detonator, causing it to pop open. The internal wheel turned in an orderly manner, slowly opening completely.
0:37:46|0:38:9|[Cui Minho] meticulously operated the process on the tablet, clicked "ok" on the pop-up window, the connections on the portable nuclear device disconnected one by one, then slowly automatically closed, restoring its original spherical shape.
0:38:21|0:38:51|[Cui Minho] and [Park Yuzhe] nodded at each other. Inside the helicopter, [Zhao Zhiren] pursed his lips, sat up straight, closed his eyes slowly, leaned back against the seat back, and the main rotor of the helicopter spun rapidly as it descended towards the ground.
0:38:51|0:39:8|After two police motorcycles, followed by two police cars, slowly approached and stopped outside the isolation zone with the portable nuclear device, the back doors opened. [Li Yanming] and [Zhao Zhiren] got out of the car. [Zhao Zhiren] buttoned up his coat and followed closely behind [Cui Minho]'s men.
0:39:21|0:39:37|Han Fang and the other two looked towards the sound, [Zhao Zhiren] also turned to look, [Song An] with one hand in his pocket, appeared with his assistant behind. The expressions of the crowd were different, not knowing what had happened. Back at the intelligence center, [Li Yanming] took a few steps up the stairs and walked in.
0:39:37|0:39:44|[Song An] is drinking water from his personal cup.
0:40:10|0:40:24|[Song An] turned his head to look at [Li Yanming], then walked towards him, put his arm around his shoulder, patted him on the back while pulling him to sit down beside him. The assistant also turned to look at the two of them. [Song An] sat on the sofa with his legs crossed, leaning against the back of the sofa.
0:40:52|0:40:58|[Li Yanming] no longer looked at him and swallowed a mouthful of saliva.
0:41:10|0:41:16|The two of them held onto the sofa and looked at each other. In the underground passage, one of the three Korean men opened the door.
0:41:24|0:41:41|The two men slowly walked in carrying a box, [Park Yuzhe] gestured 123 to signal, and the two men slowly put the box down. [Cui Minho] pointed outside to indicate leaving. The empty meeting room of the intelligence center, with only the box containing the portable nuclear device placed on a yellow table.
0:42:35|0:42:46|The South Korean consul angrily took off his earpiece, cursed a few times, put the earpiece back on, and pointed at [Song An], asking:
0:42:56|0:43:3|Standing up, [Zhao Zhiren] looked at [Li Yanming], while [Cui Minho] also looked at [Zhao Zhiren]. [Li Yanming] raised his head to remind [Zhao Zhiren] with his eyes.
0:43:21|0:43:26|Unless for some reason, [Li Yanming] awkwardly touched his face.
0:43:51|0:43:56|[Li Yanming] looked up at [Zhao Zhiren], who had stopped and calmed down.
0:44:13|0:44:25|[Li Yanming] reached out to pull [Zhao Zhiren] to sit down, but stood up and pushed him down onto the seat. [Zhao Zhiren] looked at the two trembling with lips but not speaking.
0:44:28|0:44:46|After saying that, [Li Yanming] weakly uttered a sentence, then turned to look at [Zhao Zhiren] who was leaving, and turned back to the meeting room. The assistant sat down next to [Song An].
0:45:18|0:45:23|[Song An] listened to the words and turned to his assistant, who looked back at [Song An].
0:45:28|0:45:36|Under the calm white clouds, a glass office building stands tall. The elevator doors open inside the building, and Li Yanming walks out.
0:46:6|0:46:15|The people inside were all working and they got up and left one after another. [Ma Dongmei] came to a computer and used a remote control to open the sunshade curtains. Then they both turned to the big screen.
0:46:47|0:47:19|[Li Yanming] blinked and looked at him. A black car slowly stopped on the road, and [Song An] and his assistant got out of the car. The two of them closed the car door and walked towards the steps by the road. The wall next to the steps was covered with anti-nuclear weapon posters. Looking down the assistant's legs, there were also anti-nuclear weapon symbols below. [Zhao Zhiren] came over and opened the door. [Song An] walked straight into the house, and [Zhao Zhiren] glanced at the female assistant before closing the door.
0:47:23|0:47:30|[Song An] looked around inside, at the simply furnished living room filled with books.
0:47:42|0:48:0|Staring at him with a slow smile, she walked away and brought two cups of tea to the two people already sitting on the sofa.
0:48:46|0:49:7|Zhao Zhiren didn't say anything and turned to look at him. He found Song An looking at the computer, so he exited the interface, leaned back in the chair, and turned around. Song An nodded.
0:50:10|0:50:38|[Zhao Zhiren] walked over, picked up the teacup on the table and handed it to [Song An]. [Song An] looked at the teacup and took it, holding the saucer with both hands. [Zhao Zhiren] then walked to directly in front of [Song An].
0:51:36|0:52:12|The two men stared at each other, engaging in a silent showdown. [Zhao Zhiren] walked to the window and watched as [Song An] drove away. Inside the car, [Song An] said, "We have arrived in Macau." A black sedan pulled up in front of a luxury hotel, and the doorman opened the back door. [Zhang Yijun] and [Jin Taonian] got out of the car one after the other, followed by bodyguards. Then, [Jin Taonian] walked with a bodyguard to a greyhound racing track.
0:52:12|0:52:17|A foreign leader is holding a notebook and taking notes.
0:52:34|0:52:43|Three henchmen simultaneously pulled out their guns and aimed at [Jin Taonian]. [Jin Taonian] glanced at them sideways and then turned around, saying,
0:54:10|0:54:40|The leader turned back in anger and walked into a small alley where rainwater from the eaves dripped onto the ground. [Zhang Yijun] had changed into a short wig and sunglasses, walking past and scanning the nearby buildings. He climbed up an old residential building, knocked on the door of a household, and a man with glasses opened the door to look at him. The space inside the house was very cramped, with a dual-screen computer displaying a gaming interface on one side and code on the other. Another hacker with glasses emerged from the bathroom.
0:54:40|0:54:56|[Zhang Yijun] took out a folded paper from the room, and the man who came out of the toilet opened the paper through a small mirror on the wall, looked at [Zhang Yijun], and then sat in front of the computer, casually taking a neck pillow.
0:55:3|0:55:44|On the other side, [Jin Taonian] walked into a restaurant in Macau. As he walked in, he glanced above the stairs. The waitress sitting at the front desk looked up and asked. Short-haired woman Sofia, holding a coconut, came out and placed the items on the table of the waiting guests. She walked up to [Jin Taonian] and looked at him. She patted his face and [Jin Taonian] smiled in response. Sofia took his arm and led him inside. They sat at an empty table.
0:56:4|0:56:29|Sophia nodded and placed a coin in [Jin Taonian]'s palm. [Jin Taonian] smiled and closed his fist to accept it. He tapped the table and made Sophia laugh. They both laughed happily. Meanwhile, in the hotel, [Zhang Yijun] was watching the computer. In a small room, the hacker with glasses was also busy in front of the computer, squinting at the code on the screen.
0:56:29|0:56:57|[Zhang Yijun] was synchronizing with the man's computer on this side, and the screens of the two displayed the monitoring images of the intelligence center. In the restaurant, [Jin Taonian] was eating braised pig's trotters heartily, while Sophia rolled a cigarette in her hand. [Jin Taonian] put down his knife and fork to chew, and Sophia handed him the cigarette. [Jin Taonian] took the cigarette and put it in his mouth.
0:56:57|0:57:26|Taking out a lighter from his pocket, Sofia watched as he lit the fire. [Jin Taonian] took a deep drag, looked at the smoke coming out of his nose, and then handed the cigarette to Sofia. [Jin Taonian] pushed the paper he had just taken out in front of Sofia. Sofia sat up straight, opened the paper, put on the glasses hanging on her chest, and looked at the content on the paper. Removing her glasses, Sofia asked:
0:57:33|0:58:4|[Jin Taonian] smiled, raised the white wine glass and drank it all in one gulp. The scene shifted to a place filled with Indian architectural style, where many Indians were walking towards a domed temple. [Park Yuzhe] and others drove to the front, unbuckled their seat belts and got out of the car. [Cui Minho] walked while observing the nearby Indians. [Shen Meijing] walked at the front, and the three of them walked quickly inside. A man wearing a red Indian hat was observing them at the entrance.
0:58:5|0:58:31|Heading up the stairs, [Shen Meijing] put on a scarf, while [Cui Minho] kept an eye on the movements downstairs. [Shen Meijing] wrapped the scarf around her head, bowed towards the middle of the aisle, walked to the side, and handed a headscarf to both [Cui Minho] and [Park Yuzhe]. Many Indians walked out of the temple room, while people in the kitchen were making Indian specialty pancakes.
0:58:31|0:59:3|A man is making pancakes, while two men are grilling them. Led by one of the men, three people who are already dressed up walk into the kitchen. [Shen Meijing] eagerly approaches the man grilling pancakes. The pancake man, wearing glasses, looks up at them in the dining hall. Many women are sitting on the ground in rows eating, and [Shen Meijing] is also sitting among them. An old man scoops a spoonful of curry rice into [Park Yuzhe]'s plate and smiles, nodding at him.
1:0:10|1:0:19|Park Yuzhe and Cui Minho could only sit far away, observing their conversation. Shen Meijing turned around to ponder, outside the hotel, Yuan Xiaowen got into the car.
1:1:11|1:1:27|Turning to the front again, at a dock, a forklift is carrying containers. A worker in a yellow work uniform hurries towards the inquiry desk at the entrance, sits down, and looks outside while taking out a phone from his pocket to press the keys.
1:1:39|1:1:42|Standing in front of the glass window in the corridor, he picked up the phone.
1:1:51|1:2:8|The bridge was originally built by a lake. Two police cars drove into the garage of the intelligence center. [Zhao Zhiren] carried a briefcase through security check, escorted by staff through the revolving door, while paying attention to the offices upstairs as he walked. He then turned around and handed the briefcase to the police officer behind him.
1:2:17|1:2:27|Then he handed the phone to him, in the underground passage, [Zhao Zhiren] used a card to scan and open the door storing the portable nuclear device, pushed the door slightly, and then walked in.
1:2:36|1:2:51|[Zhao Zhiren] was testing the air near the handheld nuclear detonator, holding the detector in one hand and observing the data, while [Fan Jiaming], with a wounded face, wearing headphones, waited for the detector to continuously emit electrical sounds in the air. Suddenly, the detector's reaction intensified.
1:3:3|1:3:28|He took off his headphones and immediately ran out. In the underground passage, [Zhao Zhiren] was carrying his assistant and running out. Two staff members at the door quickly pulled open the curtain. [Zhao Zhiren] placed his assistant on the ground, the spray head was turned on, and the cleaning machine sprayed out. [Zhao Zhiren] raised his hands, turned them towards his body for cleaning. Suddenly, [Zhao Zhiren] put down his hands, took a deep breath, and through the goggles of the gas mask, you could see his eyes turning.
1:3:28|1:3:42|Water droplets from the cleaning agent continuously dripped down, as [Zhao Zhiren] emerged from the underground passage and leaned against the table, where [Fan Jiaming] sat watching him.
1:4:19|1:4:24|Absurd, picking up the coat on the chair and shaking it, walked angrily towards the outside, [Fan Jiaming] hurriedly caught up.
1:4:40|1:5:0|The man with glasses noticed the people getting off the car in the surveillance footage, so he pushed his glasses up, leaned in closer, played the footage in reverse to observe the frame where they got off, then put on headphones, reached for the phone next to him. The screen switched to Macau, where there were not many people on the street, everything was very calm.
1:5:0|1:5:21|Until [Li Yanming] drove to the restaurant with a team of people, [Jin Taonian] stopped his taxi on the other road and watched them from inside the car, observing as [Li Yanming] and others entered the restaurant. Sofia was inside the restaurant calculating the bill, and the wind chimes at the door rang.
1:5:31|1:5:41|Sophia took off her glasses and looked at the person coming in. [Li Yanming] sat down opposite her and looked at her, saying,
1:6:16|1:6:27|A police officer walked over from behind with an informant, and Sophia turned around and sat down, watching [Li Yanming] return to his seat.
1:6:59|1:7:32|On the outside terrace, [Zhang Yijun] pushed aside the hanging clothes, holding a sniper rifle as she approached the edge of the terrace, aiming the gun at the police officers waiting outside the restaurant below. Inside the taxi, [Jin Taonian] also took out a sniper rifle and aimed it outside. Sophia twisted open the cap of the white wine bottle on the table and poured a glass, but [Li Yanming] snatched the glass from her hand and threw it on the ground, then leaned forward with his hands on his knees, looking at her.
1:7:45|1:7:53|[Li Yanming] took out his phone and handed it to Sophia. Sophia picked up the phone and looked at the screen.
1:8:5|1:8:13|The granddaughter, swinging on the swing, with tears in her eyes, said:
1:8:42|1:9:5|[Jin Taonian] nervously watched the person walking out, his scope aimed directly at Sofia. Sofia walked while casting a sidelong glance, [Jin Taonian] gripped the sniper rifle tightly, squinted his eyes, and focused on the red dot of the scope. He hesitated, swallowed hard, and moved his finger, aiming at Sofia's forehead. Sofia continued to walk forward, staring straight ahead, while [Jin Taonian] in the taxi was still hesitating.
1:9:5|1:9:35|Sophia subtly nodded and suddenly stopped. [Jin Taonian] closed his eyes and his finger curved towards the trigger. Sophia waited, while the officer beside her sensed something was wrong. [Li Yanming] stopped and turned to look at Sophia. She smiled at him. Wrinkles formed around [Jin Taonian]'s eyes, but it was [Zhang Yijun] on the rooftop who fired first. Sophia fell to the ground in response, and in a quick reaction, [Li Yanming] knelt down in shock.
1:9:35|1:9:42|Noticing the clothes trembling on the rooftop, [Zhao Zhiren] quickly got up and ran towards the building, jumping over the benches on the side of the road, rapidly swinging his arms.
1:9:43|1:9:49|In the taxi, [Jin Taonian] pounded the steering wheel a few times, gritted his teeth and started the car, driving into a narrow alley.
1:9:49|1:10:18|[Zhang Yijun] just ran downstairs, and [Li Yanming] appeared at the alley entrance. Seeing the figure, he quickly caught up. The driver, [Jin Taonian], was ready to pick them up. [Zhang Yijun] ran forward with all her might, pushing aside pedestrians on the road. [Li Yanming] followed closely behind. Suddenly, two police officers appeared in front of [Zhang Yijun], blocking her way. Before the other officer could react, [Zhang Yijun] cut his throat. [Li Yanming] caught up from behind, grabbed [Zhang Yijun]'s backpack, and as she turned around, she kicked [Li Yanming] in the groin.
1:10:18|1:10:24|[Li Yanming] fell to the ground in pain, and suddenly a black sedan rushed out at the intersection, knocking [Zhang Yijun] to the ground.
1:10:56|1:11:21|Both of them fell to the ground. [Li Yanming] grabbed her back but was reversed and pinned against the rearview mirror, then took a knee to the stomach. [Zhang Yijun] tried to climb the iron fence again, but was pulled down by [Li Yanming] grabbing her hair. They started fighting again, and [Zhang Yijun] pressed down with her elbow, hammering [Li Yanming]'s arm. [Li Yanming] hugged her and threw her towards the car, then used both hands to smash [Zhang Yijun]'s head against the car body. [Zhang Yijun] resisted by grabbing his shoulder, took a knee to the stomach again, and [Li Yanming] lifted her thigh.
1:11:21|1:11:44|Getting ready to take her down, unexpectedly [Zhang Yijun] hooked her other leg around his neck, and the two fell to the ground in a tangle. [Li Yanming] struggled as his neck was pressed, and in desperation, he bit [Zhang Yijun]'s thigh. Feeling the pain, [Zhang Yijun] released him, and as [Li Yanming] knelt over her, he threw a punch. [Zhang Yijun] blocked with her arm and struck [Li Yanming]'s eye with her hand. Then, [Zhang Yijun] flipped on top, pressing one leg against his neck.
1:11:44|1:12:2|Twisting upwards, [Li Yanming] tightly closed his eyes and opened his mouth to resist, while [Zhang Yijun] was still trying hard to strangle him. [Li Yanming]'s eyes gradually became unfocused, veins bulging. At this moment, the arriving officers helped pull [Zhang Yijun] away. Several people pointed their guns at her, while one person helped [Li Yanming] up from the ground and walked towards her, delivering a kick to her helpless abdomen.
1:12:5|1:12:22|The police officer quickly stopped [Li Yanming], and after [Zhang Yijun] was helped up, she glared fiercely at [Li Yanming]. [Li Yanming] touched the wound on his face, while the officer still held him back, only patting his shoulder after [Zhang Yijun] was taken away. [Jin Taonian] who drove there, rolled down the car window.
1:12:22|1:12:29|Watching [Zhang Yijun] being pushed towards the police car. With so many police officers around, he could only stare from inside the car.
1:12:30|1:12:39|[Zhang Yijun] was pushed into the car and sat down calmly, while [Jin Taonian] rolled up the window and drove away.
1:12:43|1:12:53|Under the night sky, Hong Kong is orderly and bustling with bright lights in the city. [Cui Minho] and others are eating hot pot by the roadside.
1:13:4|1:13:9|Shen Meijing stopped what she was doing, blinked, and put down the chopsticks.
1:13:52|1:14:4|[Park Yuzhe] took a deep breath. At that moment, a waiter brought a dish to the table. He glanced at the waiter and then at [Cui Minho]. [Cui Minho] raised his glass and took a sip, while [Shen Meijing] continued to cook the food in the pot.
1:14:29|1:14:35|Park Yuzhe took a sip, and Cui Minho frowned and drank it all in one gulp.
1:14:51|1:14:55|Park Yuzhe stood up angrily, breathing heavily as he looked at Cui Minho.
1:14:55|1:14:58|Shen Meijing looks at the angry Park Yuzhe.
1:15:8|1:15:26|[Cui Minho] also stood up, the two stared at each other, [Shen Meijing] stood up as well. [Cui Minho] turned to [Shen Meijing] in surprise, when a car suddenly stopped beside them.
1:15:28|1:15:39|[Fan Jiaming] got off the car and stumbled towards the three people, then quickly grabbed the interpreter.
1:15:48|1:15:56|Disguised [Jin Taonian], wearing a long wig and carrying a guitar covered in stickers, is waiting for the ticket inspection. He picks up the phone.
1:16:8|1:16:13|Hanging up the call with the hacker wearing glasses, [Zhao Zhiren] moved forward while pulling out the phone.
1:16:38|1:16:43|Walking in the underground passage, [Cui Minho] said this and then continued walking forward.
1:16:43|1:17:0|[Park Yuzhe] hesitated for a moment, then followed up. The three of them left the underground passage and arrived at the intelligence center, walking towards the conference room filled with waiting people. The sensor door opened, and the three of them walked up the steps. [Zhao Zhiren] stood up from his chair, smiled and gestured to [Cui Minho], who responded in kind.
1:17:0|1:17:27|[Zhao Zhiren] put on the interpreter, [Cui Minho] turned to look out the window, and [Song An] who was also wearing the interpreter stopped as well. [Fan Jiaming] stood up, it turned out that [Zhang Yijun] was being brought over with handcuffs by [Li Yanming]. Several police officers followed [Zhang Yijun] to the interrogation room. [Zhang Yijun] walked with a limp due to his injury, and everyone in the meeting room stared at them. The scene shifted, and [Zhang Yijun] was taken to the interrogation room.
1:17:29|1:17:35|She had taken off her coat, her hands were handcuffed to the table, sitting calmly on the chair. [Fan Jiaming] walked up and said:
1:17:43|1:18:16|[Cui Minho] and [Song An] both glanced sideways, as a crowd in a racecourse were fervently discussing on the stands, watching the competition on the field. Outside the racecourse railing, [Jin Taonian] walked through the crowd, carrying a bag over one shoulder, observing as he walked towards the ticket office. Passing by people betting on the event, on the other side [Li Yanming] entered the interrogation room with a bottle of water and a sandwich. [Zhang Yijun] tilted her head to look at him, while a police officer adjusted the sound system.
1:18:16|1:18:25|[Li Yanming] placed the sandwich on the table and unscrewed the water bottle. [Zhang Yijun] tilted her head but didn't respond. People next door were all standing behind the one-way mirror.
1:18:25|1:18:35|Pay attention to everything in the interrogation room. [Zhang Yijun] lowered her head, and [Li Yanming] placed the water bottle on the table, supporting the table with both hands.
1:18:42|1:18:54|[Zhang Yijun] blinked and did not answer. There was a moment of silence, then he continued to ask. [Zhang Yijun] had a cold smile on his lips and ignored it. [Li Yanming] nodded and then walked to her side.
1:19:5|1:19:12|[Zhang Yijun] leaned back and didn't say anything, so [Li Yanming] leaned in close to her ear.
1:19:23|1:19:44|Watching him raise his middle finger, [Li Yanming] stood up straight, [Zhang Yijun] let go of the hand holding the iron chain, [Li Yanming] walked directly behind him, grabbed her hair, pressed her forehead back with one hand, then pulled her blouse over her face, picked up the water bottle on the table and poured water on her face, [Zhang Yijun] fiercely resisted, the iron chain making continuous noise on the iron table.
1:19:44|1:20:7|[Li Yanming] kept pouring water on her face, she raised her hand to stop the torture, but her hand was locked on the table. [Li Yanming] kicked the chair leg, [Zhang Yijun] fell to the ground, but also got a chance to catch her breath. [Li Yanming] then pressed her against the table, a female police officer opened the door, pointed outside, slapped her face, and then ran out. [Zhang Yijun] squatted on the ground, gasping for breath.
1:20:9|1:20:22|Continuously blowing the hair in front of his face, in the intelligence center, everyone is running outwards. They gather in front of the screen in the hall, where the enlarged live broadcast appears on the screen.
1:20:44|1:20:49|Various pop-up windows appeared on the big screen, followed by a synthesized face.
1:20:57|1:21:4|It is obvious that the criminal has used a voice changer, and everyone is looking at the screen.
1:22:26|1:22:47|[Zhao Zhiren] left upon hearing the sound, [Cui Minho] nodded and followed him, while [Shen Meijing] and others drove away. The scene shifted to a seafood market, where an Indian man on a motorcycle stopped by the roadside, got off and walked towards the market. The seafood vendors in the market looked puzzled at this group of people.
1:22:49|1:23:3|They walked to the shore, where a man on the small boat was smoking a pipe. They walked down the steps onto the boat and looked at the man, who had just finished eating and was lighting his pipe with a lighter.
1:23:5|1:23:27|Several people turned around, [Jin Taonian] wearing a hat stood on the steps looking at the person smoking a pipe. In the drizzle, [Jin Taonian] had no expression on his face. On the other side of the airport, [Yuan Xiaowen] held a red folder in her hand, followed by a team of experts. [Yuan Xiaowen] walked to the front of the car and handed the file to the person receiving it. The members of the expert team then got into the car one after another.
1:23:54|1:24:17|He reached out his hands and shook hands with [Cui Minho], who lowered his head and looked at [Zhao Zhiren]. [Park Yuzhe] watched their actions, and as they let go of hands, [Cui Minho] clenched his fist and withdrew his hand. [Zhao Zhiren] extended his arm to signal to move forward, then watched as the two passed through the curtain in the clean area and took a few steps forward, pursing his lips with an unreadable expression on his face. At the entrance, [Li Yanming] and his team arrived.
1:24:17|1:24:35|A police officer opens the door, [Cui Minho] and [Park Yuzhe] walk out carrying a nuclear bomb device, carefully placing it in the trunk. [Zhao Zhiren] stands behind, supporting his knees with his hands, crouching and watching. [Cui Minho] glances sideways at [Zhao Zhiren], and finally [Park Yuzhe] raises his hand to close the trunk.
1:24:43|1:25:14|[Li Yanming] nodded, called out to [Cui Minho] who was about to leave, reached out his hand towards him. [Cui Minho] turned around, looked at the hand holding his, while [Zhao Zhiren] pursed his lips. The three of them walked towards the door. At this moment, [Zhang Yijun] was also brought out, a female police officer pushed her into the car. [Li Yanming] grabbed her still-handcuffed hands, placed them on the steering wheel, and began to unlock the handcuffs with a key.
1:25:17|1:25:41|[Zhang Yijun] put down the hand that was untied, the untied handcuff was placed on the steering wheel by [Li Yanming], [Zhang Yijun] slightly moved the corner of her mouth, followed by nine cars, [Zhang Yijun]'s car drove forward. On the road under the night sky, the dim yellow lights covered the road, police cars flashing their lights, inside the car was [Yuan Xiaowen] with the expert team.
1:25:41|1:25:49|A truck on the road came up in time, gradually catching up with the police car, rushing to the side of the police car, driving side by side. At this moment,
1:25:49|1:26:20|Hidden in the truck, [Jin Taonian] pulled out a gun and, along with his Indian henchmen, started shooting at the police car. The people inside the car were shot and fell to the ground. [Jin Taonian] and his men relentlessly fired at the police car, riddling the windows with bullet holes. The police car stopped on the side of the road, and the truck and the car in front braked to a halt. [Jin Taonian] and his group got on the police car, watching [Yuan Xiaowen] struggling on the ground, holding her arm. [Jin Taonian] also aimed at her.
1:26:20|1:26:57|With a few gunshots, several bullet holes appeared behind the police car. Two Indian henchmen outside the car looked around with their guns. In the bustling streets of Macau under the night sky, no one knew that the police car on the road had been attacked. A gray sedan drove up the slope towards a bend, and a foreigner opened the door for [Shen Meijing]. She walked to the balcony and ran to the basket on the balcony. Her face was already pale.
1:26:57|1:27:18|There was blood spilling out on his chest, [Shen Meijing] looked at him in astonishment, [Fan Jiaming] turned his head and reached into his pocket, taking out a cellphone. Inside the moving car, [Zhang Yijun] drove calmly on the highway. A taxi drove alongside her and quickly passed her. Several surveillance cars followed behind [Zhang Yijun]'s car. She glanced at the rearview mirror.
1:27:18|1:27:36|In the car behind, [Li Yanming] stared ahead. The red light, [Zhang Yijun] stopped the car. [Li Yanming]'s car pulled up next to hers, and he looked at [Zhang Yijun] through the car window. After the green light, several cars continued to drive. [Li Yanming] reached into his pocket, took out his earphones, and put them on.
1:27:52|1:28:23|[Zhang Yijun] looked back through the rearview mirror with a smug smile, stepped on the gas pedal and passed through the intersection, shaking off the car behind. Several cars maneuvered around the vehicles on the road. [Zhang Yijun] skillfully drove the car through the narrow one-way street, keeping an eye on the situation behind through the rearview mirror. The monitoring police officers anxiously followed into an underground parking lot, but [Zhang Yijun] had already entered the elevator, leaving [Li Yanming] and the others to rush out of the car.
1:28:23|1:28:49|But the elevator doors still closed. [Li Yanming] grabbed the last police officer and said, pushing him. The officers came up the stairs with guns, one by one entering the hallway. [Li Yanming] walked at the back. Several people blocked the elevator door upstairs, and [Li Yanming] also raised his gun towards the elevator door. The elevator door opened, and the officers, with guns raised and legs bent, entered. One officer quickly raised his gun to check upwards.
1:28:49|1:28:55|Another police officer walked towards the car, with only the handcuffs unlocked on the steering wheel. He also raised his gun and looked up.
1:28:55|1:29:18|[Li Yanming] watched as the police officers in the car made a series of movements, then he put down the gun, placed it in the gun bag, and walked towards the trunk. He opened the trunk, put down his hands, and reached for the portable nuclear device. Opening the device's cover, he found it empty. He looked up as [Zhang Yijun] ran away with the portable nuclear device. In another car, [Park Yuzhe] was driving while [Cui Minho] made a phone call.
1:30:7|1:30:39|[Park Yuzhe] drove into a narrow alley, [Cui Minho] picked up a piece of paper and looked at the GPS. They passed through another alley, [Cui Minho] asked anxiously, [Park Yuzhe] looked around and slowly stopped the car. Next to them was a slightly old factory. [Cui Minho] unbuckled his seatbelt and got out of the car, carrying a large black bag on his back.
1:30:39|1:30:53|[Park Yuzhe] held a phone in his hand, leading the way in front, tilting his head to look at the trucks on both sides to find the right road. When they reached the end, they found themselves at the seaside. The two looked across the water. [Cui Minho] turned around, looked at the pier, and asked,
1:30:56|1:31:2|[Park Yuzhe] looked at his phone again when gunshots rang out. He quickly tackled [Cui Minho].
1:31:3|1:31:19|[Jin Taonian] and others came over from the back of the truck, [Park Yuzhe] said angrily. They got off the truck and jogged towards them, getting closer and closer through the rearview mirror of the truck parked on the side of the road, suddenly so many people rushed out.
1:31:21|1:31:40|[Cui Minho] looked nervously and said. The two turned to look around, [Park Yuzhe] pulled [Cui Minho] and was about to run to the side. The person who was approaching immediately shot and chased after them quickly. Suddenly, [Park Yuzhe]'s hand reached out from the middle of the truck, took the gun from him, and shot towards the opponent's companion. The person fell to the ground without any support, [Park Yuzhe] quickly hid behind the truck.
1:31:44|1:32:3|[Cui Minho] nodded, [Park Yuzhe] handed the gun to [Cui Minho], who then shot into the distance. Upon hearing the sound, [Park Yuzhe] quickly ran to the side and slid to pick up the gun on the ground, continuously firing towards the opposite side. The Indian henchmen took cover behind the truck as [Park Yuzhe] advanced while shooting. [Cui Minho] hid behind the truck, while [Park Yuzhe] just moved to the truck diagonally across.
1:32:3|1:32:24|An Indian henchman approached from the side, and suddenly a shot sent him flying backwards. [Park Yuzhe] turned his head in surprise, while [Cui Minho] quickly reloaded. The two nodded at each other and ran in the same direction, gradually escaping the Indian's encirclement. [Cui Minho] ran ahead, while [Park Yuzhe] kept an eye on the situation behind them. Suddenly, the Indian henchman fired at the two running figures, and [Cui Minho] was hit and fell to the ground.
1:32:25|1:32:50|Park Yuzhe quickly fired a few shots, while Cui Minho struggled to move backward. The two of them hid behind the truck as the Indian men approached and started shooting. Park Yuzhe returned fire, but ran out of bullets and threw the gun aside. Cui Minho, clutching his wounded shoulder, cried out in pain. Park Yuzhe picked up Cui Minho's gun, peeked out and shot one person, but facing intense firepower, Park Yuzhe chose to support Cui Minho and they started to escape. The two turned into a small road next to the parking area, with Cui Minho hanging his injured arm.
1:32:51|1:33:1|With the support of [Park Yuzhe], they struggled to move forward, crossed a hallway with a lot of stagnant water, and hid behind a truck. [Park Yuzhe] tore a piece of cloth from his body and tied it around [Cui Minho]'s arm.
1:33:6|1:33:30|[Cui Minho] has started to turn pale due to blood loss. The two of them cautiously peeked out to assess the situation. [Park Yuzhe] ran towards the other side, where one of the henchmen was slowly approaching. Suddenly, [Park Yuzhe] appeared and struck him on the chin. A scuffle ensued, with [Park Yuzhe] being choked while the other person attempted to smash his head against a concrete pile. [Park Yuzhe] extended an arm to block the attack and forcefully pushed the person towards the concrete pile. At that moment, [Cui Minho] picked up a gun from the ground, preparing to shoot, but then another person arrived from behind.
1:33:30|1:33:47|He quickly turned and fired a shot at the other person. [Cui Minho] turned around, while [Park Yuzhe] was still struggling. Suddenly, [Cui Minho] threw a punch at the man behind him, causing him to let go in pain. [Park Yuzhe] quickly turned around and landed a few more punches, finally knocking the man down. [Cui Minho] then threw the gun he had just taken from the opponent to [Park Yuzhe].
1:33:48|1:34:4|Zhao Zhiren and Li Yanming didn't notice Jin Taonian across the way. Jin Taonian shot Park Yuzhe in the shoulder. The two quickly took cover, while Zhang Yijun, holding a gun, also rushed over. They both charged towards Park Yuzhe, continuously shooting at the concrete piles they were hiding behind. Cui Minho, facing intense firepower, fired back at them until he ran out of bullets.
1:34:4|1:34:32|[Park Yuzhe] slowed down a bit and started shooting towards the opposite side, while [Cui Minho] ran to the side. [Park Yuzhe] also shot while retreating, [Jin Taonian] and [Zhang Yijun] quickly caught up. [Jin Taonian] appeared in the gap between the cars and shot [Cui Minho] in the back. [Park Yuzhe] immediately started shooting at [Jin Taonian], while [Cui Minho], with blood all over his hands, struggled to lift the gun and fired several shots. [Jin Taonian] was hit first.
1:34:32|1:34:49|Hastily hiding behind a cement pile, [Park Yuzhe] took the opportunity to quickly support [Cui Minho] and run to the side. Several shots hit [Cui Minho] leaning against the car over there. [Park Yuzhe] turned around, raised the gun in his hand and fired two shots, then went to support the falling [Cui Minho], dragging his shoulder to hide behind the car. However, blood gushed from [Cui Minho]'s mouth.
1:34:49|1:35:7|[Park Yuzhe] held back tears as he supported his head. [Cui Minho] coughed and reached into his pocket, one hand grabbing onto [Park Yuzhe]'s arm. He took out the paper with the address written on it, struggling to speak, then used his hand to make [Park Yuzhe] hold onto the paper. [Park Yuzhe] clenched the paper in his hand.
1:35:29|1:35:45|[Park Yuzhe] looked at [Cui Minho] lying on the ground with his head down, then turned his eyes to the back. [Zhang Yijun] had already arrived behind him, with [Jin Taonian] standing next to her. They all held guns pointing at [Park Yuzhe]. He turned his head, and his body was immediately covered with bullets, falling next to [Cui Minho].
1:35:47|1:36:12|Watching the two people, [Jin Taonian] and [Zhang Yijun], lying on the ground, [Park Yuzhe] put away the gun, holding a piece of paper in his hand, stopped in front of [Cui Minho]. A pool of blood seeped from [Cui Minho]'s back to his head, with two guns dropped at his feet. Under the light, the shadows of [Jin Taonian] and [Zhang Yijun] stretched backwards. The next day, the police and forensic team arrived, lifting the body bags of the two people from the ground.
1:36:12|1:36:37|An male assistant walks towards [Song An], who looks at him with a furrowed brow, closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, slowly opens his eyes, blinks and ponders on the quiet streets of South Korea. A taxi slowly approaches, inside the house, Yin Xishan and [Cui Minho]'s mother are playing with the child.
1:36:39|1:37:5|Yoon Hee-shan turned his head, got up from the carpet and walked towards the door. He pressed the video intercom, and [Shen Meijing]'s face appeared on the screen. Yoon Hee-shan hesitated for a moment and then went to open the door for [Shen Meijing]. He tried to lift the corners of his mouth, but failed. Yoon Hee-shan's pupils dilated as he looked at her. [Shen Meijing] didn't speak, but gave a confirming look.
1:37:6|1:37:32|Yoon Hee-shan held onto the wall, feeling unsteady, tears welling up in her eyes. She leaned against the wall, slowly sliding down. [Shen Meijing] hurried to support her. Yoon Hee-shan sat on the ground, looked up at [Shen Meijing] again, holding [Li Tailai]'s hand for comfort, patting her shoulder. In the living room separated by a wall, the mother still did not know she had lost her son.
1:37:32|1:37:34|The child doesn't know that he has lost his father.
1:37:34|1:37:49|In the intelligence center, [Li Yanming] leaned against the glass, looking out the window with one hand, scanning the entire intelligence center.
1:37:57|1:38:13|Closing his eyes and lowering his head, then raising it again as he walked in the office, the monitor's image reflected on the glass. He slowly walked to the desk, suddenly picked up the file on the table and smashed it on the ground, then swept everything on the table to the floor one by one.
1:38:15|1:38:28|The officers in the office looked up as [Li Yanming] vented angrily in the office, and a female officer walked in.
1:38:33|1:38:41|[Li Yanming] slowly lifted his head to look at the female police officer, then sat in front of the computer, put on headphones, and started listening to the audio of [Zhao Zhiren] making a phone call.
1:39:23|1:39:48|[Li Yanming] picked up the pen and paper next to him, put on his glasses, replayed the audio, and jotted down notes on the paper. He numbered the Chinese characters he had just written one by one, blinking as he contemplated. He took off his headphones, clicked the mouse, and played the audio again.
1:40:38|1:40:44|Recalling the conversation with [Zhao Zhiren] and [Song An], he left the chair and ran out.
1:40:53|1:41:18|The car started, [Fan Jiaming] turned around and watched them leave. There was a hint of discomfort in his bloodshot eyes. On a typewriter, [Zhao Zhiren]'s hands were quickly typing on it, finishing a line and then backspacing. Through the window, a white car could be seen parked downstairs. [Zhao Zhiren] looked down and smiled, then turned back to continue typing.
1:41:22|1:41:39|[Li Yanming] signaled his subordinates to stop and walked forward himself. He slowly climbed the stairs. The door of [Zhao Zhiren]'s house was not locked. After observing for a moment, he opened the door, looked around, and then walked into the living room where music was playing.
1:41:43|1:42:14|[Zhao Zhiren] walked out of the kitchen, handed [Li Yanming] a cup of tea, then walked ahead by himself, closed the stereo, put down his own tea cup and sat on a chair. [Li Yanming] sat down across from him at the table, and [Zhao Zhiren] continued to type by himself.
1:42:44|1:43:3|[Zhao Zhiren] smiled, adjusted his glasses, turned his chair to look at him, while [Li Yanming] leaned forward.
1:43:20|1:43:38|[Zhao Zhiren] watched while drinking tea, taking a sip and placing the teacup back on the saucer. He smiled and looked at [Li Yanming], waiting for him to speak again. [Zhao Zhiren] nodded with a deeper smile, while [Li Yanming] lowered his head and then raised it again.
1:44:18|1:44:30|[Zhao Zhiren] took off his glasses, breathed out heavily, and wiped them carefully in his hands.
1:44:32|1:45:12|He paused and looked up, [Zhao Zhiren] approached [Li Yanming], who was waiting for [Zhao Zhiren] to raise his chin and apologize to her. Suddenly, [Zhang Yijun] appeared from behind and used a rope to strangle [Li Yanming's] neck. [Li Yanming] struggled, quickly reacted, kicked the chair and fell to the ground. However, [Zhang Yijun] continued to exert force, causing [Li Yanming's] feet to kick back and forth on the ground.
1:45:12|1:45:35|He reached for the gun at his waist, but just as he pulled it out, he was kicked away by [Jin Taonian] who was bound with bandages. [Li Yanming] looked at [Jin Taonian] with a flushed face, while [Zhao Zhiren] calmly held his glasses and watched everything. He got up from the chair and walked over slowly. [Li Yanming] struggled less and less, his feet gradually losing strength. [Zhao Zhiren] patted [Jin Taonian] on the shoulder, and [Li Yanming] on the ground gradually stopped moving.
1:45:35|1:45:45|His gaze gradually became unfocused, reflecting the face of [Zhao Zhiren] in his pupils, the rope around his neck had already cut into the flesh, soon
1:45:45|1:45:52|Li Yanming's pupils dilated sharply, his face turning pale and losing color. Zhao Zhiren looked at him, ready.
1:45:53|1:46:19|Beside Li Yanming lying on the ground, several pairs of feet walked out of the door one by one. There were three bullet holes on the car window downstairs, and the officers inside had died in the car. Zhao Zhiren and two others drove away in a black car. The room upstairs was already on fire, and with the sound of an explosion, black smoke continuously rolled out from inside. The plane's door opened and the ramp slowly descended.
1:46:20|1:46:46|Jin Haishu and a group of generals stood in formation, with family members dressed in black. The person in front held a portrait, while those behind held a spirit tablet. Several people carried a coffin down from the plane, and Park Yuzhe's body was brought back to South Korea. Yin Xishan watched as the procession approached, and Cui Minho, who was the last to come down from the plane, sat in a wheelchair with an oxygen tube inserted.
1:46:47|1:47:6|[Park Yuzhe]'s family cried and reached out to touch the memorial tablet. The staff hurried to support the mother who was about to fall. Seeing her husband, Yin Xishan couldn't help but run over and squat beside his husband's wheelchair. [Shen Meijing] also stood behind him.
1:48:0|1:48:12|With heavy breathing, [Cui Minho] struggled to raise his right hand beside his pale face, trying to salute. Seeing her husband like this, Yin Xishan couldn't help but burst into tears.
1:48:20|1:48:38|Yoon Hee-shan put down her husband's hand and leaned against his head. [Cui Minho] was breathing heavily, tightening his wife's hand. Yoon Hee-shan also grabbed her husband's shoulder with her fingers.
1:48:43|1:49:1|Arriving in Shanghai, the Huangpu River flows slowly beside the Oriental Pearl Tower, with dark clouds covering the sun in the sky. A police officer quickly runs up the stairs and looks back at [Song An] by the window.
1:49:21|1:49:47|[Song An] looks back from the window to the rusty statue of a divine beast outside the Japanese shrine. Fine snowflakes are falling in the air. Across from a pavilion with a saddle floating in the air, a train slowly pulls in. A group of tourists get off the train, and preschool children passing by look at them.
1:49:53|1:49:56|A white car stopped next to the tourists who were stretching their bodies.
1:50:1|1:50:19|[Sing An], wrapped in a scarf, slowly walked down from above. Below, tourists watched as a person got off the car and walked to the vending machine, inserted a coin, pressed a button, and took out a drink from below.
1:50:21|1:50:47|[Song An] and the others, along with the recent tourists, split into two groups and walked towards the shrine. Inside the shrine, a man was sitting reading a newspaper. [Song An] sat next to the man reading the newspaper, reaching out towards the stove in the middle. The others waited at the door. [Song An] rubbed his hands, waiting outside the platform, as the train announcement played over the speakers.
1:50:56|1:51:11|A person with a backpack, holding a book in one hand, walked slowly into the train. The staff nodded towards a distant cleaner, who then took out a phone and said something to the person reading a newspaper indoors.
1:51:13|1:51:23|[Song An] got up and left, walking out the door with him.
1:51:23|1:51:40|The group boarded the train. After the doors closed, the driver started the train, which slowly accelerated and moved along the tracks, with snow still falling outside.
1:51:42|1:51:52|[Song An] and others walked towards the carriage. The tourists who were originally sitting in the carriages also stood up.
1:51:54|1:52:3|[Song An] walked to the front and sat down. The person opposite him was reading a book.
1:52:6|1:52:15|Beyond the book, we can see [Zhao Zhiren] with a shaved head, slowly putting down the book and looking towards [Song An]. [Song An] smiled.
1:52:26|1:52:34|[Zhao Zhiren] lifted his chin even higher.
1:52:57|1:53:13|Song An's subordinates immediately raised their guns, Zhao Zhiren glanced at them, Song An waved his hand, lifted his leg, and Zhao Zhiren opened his mouth.
