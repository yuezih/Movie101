0:2:46|0:2:55|A gunshot rang out, and [Ayan] fell to the ground with blood on her head. The sudden rain seemed to be crying out for justice.
0:2:55|0:3:6|The leading figure [Boss Ding] was smoking with an extremely indifferent expression, while the rest of the workers kept their heads down in silence, no one stepped forward to speak up for [Ayan]. As the rain grew heavier on the construction site,
0:3:6|0:3:12|[Ayan]'s body was thrown onto the truck, rain mercilessly beating down on [Ayan]'s body.
0:3:12|0:3:25|Not long ago, she was still a lively life, laughing and playing with her colleagues. Now, with endless grievances, she lies still. The truck carrying the body of [Ain] slowly drives out of the factory.
0:3:25|0:3:33|Mysteriously, a bullet appeared in her mouth at some point. At the other end, in the prison's water room,
0:3:33|0:3:57|A tightly knotted hemp rope hung from the ceiling beam, while the hourglass started counting down. [Old Lu] stood on a chair under the rope, which was securely tied. He looped the rope around his neck and kicked the chair away. The rope instantly tightened around his neck, leaving him hanging with his feet off the ground, unable to breathe.
0:3:57|0:4:4|He struggled to reach for nearby support by stretching out his legs, but ended up kicking the chair even further away.
0:4:4|0:4:8|Outside the door, Seven didn't notice anything unusual inside the house.
0:4:8|0:4:17|He turned to look at the hourglass and realized something was wrong - it was stuck. He rushed into the water room, but Old Lu was nowhere to be seen.
0:5:18|0:5:26|In the prison building, [Old Lu] sat in the warden's office helping to organize documents. [Boss Ding] took the files he had processed and was about to leave.
0:5:26|0:5:34|At this moment, the official prison warden arrived.
0:6:20|0:6:26|His subordinates emptied a sack full of appeal letters, countless letters piled up on the ground into a small hill.
0:6:26|0:6:36|[Old Lu] bent down and picked up one of them.
0:6:44|0:6:58|[Old Lu] understood the mission clearly. He saluted the officer [Guo Zhui] solemnly and accepted the appointment.
0:6:58|0:7:4|On the other side of the hunting ground, Director Jin from the police station led several bosses from big factories on a hunt.
0:7:14|0:7:31|His prey was obviously not the birds in the cage, but the banknotes hidden in the secret compartment of the cage. Boss Ding and a few others understood the rules, only the newly arrived Boss Huang was unprepared. His subordinates went to complain. Boss Huang smiled and politely declined.
0:7:34|0:7:40|Director Jin took the gun from his subordinate and smiled politely at Boss Huang. Then he acted ruthlessly.
0:7:40|0:7:48|A shot was fired towards the sky. At the same time, a gunshot was heard from the distant forest, and no one knew what had happened.
0:7:48|0:7:55|Director Jin led the way, and they ran into the woods, only to see a group of plainclothes police officers surrounding a man who had been shot and fallen to the ground.
0:8:5|0:8:11|Boss Huang recognized his subordinate, but dared not make a sound. Director Jin naturally would not cover up for his subordinates.
0:8:11|0:8:25|His confidant [Nan Cheng] immediately understood, stepped forward to stand in for him, picked up a stone, and threw it at the policeman who fired the gun, letting him apologize on his own.
0:9:3|0:9:10|Boss Ding casually patted Director Jin on the shoulder and walked away with a smile.
0:9:29|0:9:47|Night has fallen, with people coming and going on the Flower Street. In a corner, a person is gnawing on a piece of rotten steamed bun, completely ignoring the fact that the bun is already crawling with worms. This person is [Guo Zhui].
0:9:47|0:9:51|He was fully focused on every move on the Flower Street.
0:9:58|0:10:7|The rules of Huajie are that when lanterns are hung, it means welcoming guests. [Guo Zhui]'s good buddy [Xiao Wu] also came along.
0:10:7|0:10:16|He stood by the sweet potato stall, quietly observing. Compared to [Guo Zhui]'s composure, he seemed somewhat naive. At this moment, the light in a room suddenly went out.
0:10:17|0:10:29|A scream from inside the house caught the attention of [Guo Zhui], who immediately looked over and noticed that there were no lanterns hanging outside that room. Sensing something amiss, he swiftly chased after it. The others followed closely behind him, initiating a pursuit.
0:10:30|0:10:34|He rushed to the scene and pushed open the door of the room, but there was no movement inside.
0:10:34|0:10:43|At this moment, he saw Yao Jie, the victim, wearing only tight underwear, tied up and hanging in mid-air. [Guo Zhui] rescued Yao Jie.
0:10:43|0:10:47|Meanwhile, Xiao Wu also arrived.
0:10:47|0:10:55|The window was wide open, and the wind from outside blew in, causing the curtains to flutter. [Guo Zhui] noticed this detail and ran to the window.
0:10:55|0:11:3|Seeing the figures of people fleeing in panic on the street, [Old Lu] leaped up, jumped out of the window, and chased after the criminal.
0:11:3|0:11:13|Without any pause, unfortunately it was still a step too late. The person had already disappeared without a trace, and [Guo Zhui] searched all around, but there was no sign of anything unusual on the street.
0:11:13|0:11:21|He turned around to pick up his fallen hat, and then he noticed a row of footprints next to it. He stared at the footprints for a long time.
0:11:21|0:11:31|This is left by the killer when breaking in through the window. [Guo Zhui] pondered and followed the footprints out of the Flower Street, arriving at another even more bustling street.
0:11:31|0:11:38|[Xiao Wu] followed quietly behind him, not daring to disturb his thoughts, as the street was bustling with traffic.
0:11:38|0:11:44|There is no trace of suspicious individuals. With no leads at the moment, continuing the pursuit would be futile.
0:11:44|0:11:49|[Guo Zhui] had to find another way and resorted to extreme measures.
0:11:49|0:11:57|He asked [Xiao Wu] to stop all the cars on the street, while he himself stood in the middle of the road, blocking the vehicles. The horns kept blaring, and the drivers were cursing loudly.
0:12:1|0:12:9|[Guo Zhui] looked around and noticed that only one person, ignoring the hustle and bustle, sneaked into a restaurant. [Guo Zhui] immediately followed.
0:12:9|0:12:16|In a high-end restaurant, there is singing and dancing.
0:12:48|0:12:51|[Guo Zhui] confidently locked onto the suspect.
0:12:51|0:13:0|The piano music continued, but the pianist was distracted. When [Guo Zhui] approached, he suddenly held a hostage at gunpoint, revealing a fierce expression.
0:13:0|0:13:7|[Guo Zhui] laughed, then suddenly drew his gun and shot without warning. His marksmanship was fast and accurate, causing the opponent to fall to the ground with a gunshot wound.
0:13:8|0:13:15|On the other end, [Old Lu] is narrating a bizarre case on the train.
0:13:40|0:13:53|Wu Zhongguo plans to use the mechanism of the clock to kill his wife. When the time comes, a dagger will spring out from the clock and stab his wife, making it look like a suicide to outsiders.
0:14:7|0:14:24|Wu Zhongguo's plan has loopholes, the blood spatter from suicide and homicide are completely different, and the missing parts of the clock mechanism will also be discovered by someone.
0:15:1|0:15:13|[Old Lu] fell into memories. Before setting off, he had met Wu Zhongguo's wife, Fu Yuan, who was a very beautiful woman. She was as clean as snow, and it was hard to imagine she was a murderer.
0:15:13|0:15:22|Old Lu didn't approach, standing on the side looking at her from a distance. Fu Yuan seemed very relaxed, while Old Lu appeared a bit reserved.
0:15:22|0:15:29|He sat down beside Fu Yuan, creating some distance between them, and [Old Lu] took out his notebook.
0:15:30|0:15:38|Fu Yuan naturally took the notes from his hand and started to read them absentmindedly. [Old Lu] looked at her, not understanding her intentions.
0:15:38|0:15:45|He only knew that this woman had many secrets hidden on her. The notebook was filled with [Old Lu]'s case-solving experiences.
0:15:55|0:16:6|She looked at [Old Lu] and asked earnestly. [Old Lu] didn't answer, just smiled politely.
0:16:7|0:16:14|Fu Yuan leaned forward, getting closer. Her eyes stared straight at [Old Lu], whispering the secret to him quietly.
0:16:15|0:16:25|[Old Lu] lowered his head and took back his notebook.
0:17:25|0:17:33|[Old Lu] was stunned, Fu Yuan approached, narrowing the distance between the two.
0:17:33|0:17:43|[Old Lu] avoided her gaze and replied awkwardly. His eyes were sincere, and Fu Yuan couldn't help but laugh. It was indeed the most heartwarming words.
0:17:44|0:17:53|Both of them laughed spontaneously, as if reaching a certain tacit understanding. They were no longer in the relationship of questioning and being questioned. [Old Lu] realized this change.
0:17:53|0:18:0|He withdrew the smile on his face, chose to stick to his own duties, broke the ambiguous atmosphere at the moment, and continued to ask questions.
0:18:3|0:18:9|Fu Yuan is a very clever woman. She understands that even if she continues, she won't get the answers she wants.
0:18:9|0:18:18|She stood up, took off the scarf around her neck, as a parting gift, and put it on [Old Lu]. She leaned close to [Old Lu]'s ear and bid him farewell.
0:18:27|0:18:35|She turned around and left gently, without looking back, but her steps were slow, perhaps she was lingering over something in her heart.
0:18:54|0:18:57|Fu Yuan left and returned to her cell.
0:18:57|0:19:6|Old Lu watched her leave all the way. Old Lu's memories ended. At this moment, he came alone to Tiancheng County.
0:19:6|0:19:13|He placed his hand on the scarf, lost in thought. The carriage carried him along the street,
0:19:13|0:19:29|The streets were bustling with people and vehicles coming and going. In the vast city, [Old Lu] seemed somewhat small as he looked around at the familiar surroundings, with a car parked in front of the police station. [Xiao Wu] was already waiting at the door to greet [Old Lu].
0:19:37|0:19:45|[Xiao Wu] took [Old Lu]'s luggage and led him into the police station. The police station was decorated very grandly, and [Old Lu] looked around, searching for his seat.
0:19:47|0:19:57|However, [Xiao Wu] led him to a desolate basement, which was a warehouse for storing files and documents. The walls were cracked, long neglected, and the roof was leaking.
0:19:57|0:19:58|Xiao Wu explained to Old Lu,
0:20:7|0:20:22|[Old Lu] smiled optimistically. [Xiao Wu] put down the luggage. Only [Old Lu] remained in the room, he blew away the dust in the room and happily accepted the working environment.
0:21:31|0:21:37|He washed his hands, walked out of the dormitory, and suddenly a gunshot rang out, alarming the entire factory.
0:21:37|0:21:46|The workers all stopped what they were doing, and the female workers at the scene screamed in shock. Inside the police station.
0:21:51|0:21:57|A butler pays bail for a prisoner. The released prisoner turns out to be the one [Guo Zhui] was chasing in Huajie.
0:21:57|0:22:5|He took the butler's gun, casually threw the bandages wrapped around him on the police table, with an extremely arrogant attitude, showing no sign of remorse.
0:22:6|0:22:10|[Guo Zhui] pushed the door open and restrained the criminal with one hand.
0:22:12|0:22:15|The criminal was forced to retreat repeatedly, and in a panic, he pulled out a gun.
0:22:15|0:22:23|Guo Zhui was one step ahead, his hand resting on the gun holster. He had witnessed Guo Zhui's amazing marksmanship before, so he hesitated, afraid to shoot.
0:22:23|0:22:33|At this moment, Director Jin entered by pushing the door.
0:22:36|0:22:42|Director Jin took the gun from his subordinate, loaded it, and walked quickly over to hand it to Guo Zhui.
0:22:48|0:22:56|[Guo Zhui] had nothing to say, looking at [Director Jin] with a sense of unwillingness in his heart. Following the director's gesture, his subordinates quickly escorted the prisoner away.
0:22:56|0:23:8|The farce came to an end, a familiar ending to everyone. [Old Lu] walked over.
0:23:10|0:23:19|After hearing the report from his subordinate, Director Jin's face changed.
0:23:23|0:23:28|[Guo Zhui] took the lead without saying a word, turned around and walked away, with [Xiao Wu] following closely behind.
0:23:28|0:23:35|[Old Lu] also nodded and bid farewell, following [Guo Zhui]. At the entrance of the police station, [Guo Zhui] and [Xiao Wu] got into the car.
0:23:35|0:23:43|Old Lu also quickly got into the car. Xiao Wu was stunned. Old Lu smiled friendly at the two of them.
0:23:43|0:23:47|Guo Zhui nodded, acquiescing to Old Lu accompanying him.
0:23:47|0:23:53|The black smoke was thick inside the arsenal, after several consecutive murders, the whole factory became oppressive and eerie.
0:23:54|0:24:5|[Guo Zhui], Old Lu, and Xiao Yunque walked into the dormitory where the incident occurred, only to find Chen Qi's body lying on the ground with a fatal wound to the forehead, blood spilling all over the floor. Next to the body, there was also a handgun.
0:24:10|0:24:15|[Old Lu] took out a notebook from his pocket and bent down to inspect the body.
0:24:15|0:24:24|Carefully recording. [Guo Zhui] picked up the gun from the ground, opened the magazine to check, and found only one blank bullet inside. He put the gun back in its original place.
0:24:25|0:24:32|Continuing to examine the fatal wound on the deceased's forehead, [Old Lu] also approached. He was forced back by a glance from [Guo Zhui].
0:24:32|0:24:42|[Old Lu] retreated honestly. [Guo Zhui] moved the body's head, the back of the head was pierced, and brain matter leaked out.
0:24:42|0:24:51|Blood was sticking to the hair. [Guo Zhui] lifted his head and seemed to notice something. A bullet hole appeared on the wall behind the body.
0:24:51|0:24:56|He walked in to inspect, and there were bloodstains in the bullet holes, as if they were Chen Qi's.
0:26:7|0:26:13|To protect the scene, [Old Lu] caught the cigarette ash dropped by [Boss Ding]. Therefore, the murderer is likely one of the workers here.
0:26:16|0:26:44|Underling Wang Haiba aimed his gun at [Old Lu], [Guo Zhui] took aim at [Boss Ding] ahead of him, neither showing any sign of backing down. The lives of the two men were in imminent danger. [Boss Ding] looked warily at [Guo Zhui], took off his hat and covered Wang Hai's gun with it, signaling an end to the confrontation. Then he glared at [Old Lu], disdainfully spat on the ground, and smirked as he looked at [Guo Zhui].
0:26:54|0:27:4|Boss Ding picked up his cigar and turned to leave. Boss Ding stopped in his tracks.
0:27:9|0:27:29|Guo Zhui appreciated Old Lu's reasoning just now and welcomed him with a smile. Xiao Wu also warmly shook hands with Old Lu. Inside the university laboratory.
0:27:48|0:27:56|Li Jia took the hair from [Old Lu]'s hand and brought it to the experiment table. She put the hair and the burning cotton together into a glass bottle.
0:27:57|0:28:4|Old Lu followed Guo Zhui around the laboratory, waiting for the results. Li Jiajing observed the changes in the glass bottle quietly.
0:28:4|0:28:13|The cotton in the bottle burned fiercely, with sparks flickering. The hair ignited instantly, emitting a large amount of smoke.
0:29:1|0:29:10|Old Lu is attacked from behind. Hidden behind the curtain is actually an ostrich.
0:29:21|0:29:24|Whenever Wang Hai is mentioned, [Guo Zhui] will fall into contemplation.
0:29:24|0:29:44|At night, three people sneaked into Wang Hai's dormitory and, as expected, found a wooden box filled with dummy bullets. [Old Lu] walked to the bed, checked the bedding which was neatly folded, different from usual. He gently opened the back corner, [Guo Zhui] also looked over, but unfortunately didn't find anything suspicious.
0:29:44|0:29:53|Old Lu carefully restored the bedding to its original state, while Guo Zhui analyzed the situation in front of him with a blank mind.
0:29:53|0:30:12|At this moment, the door of the dormitory was pushed open, and the owner of the room, Wang Hai, walked in. He quietly looked at the three uninvited guests in the room, with Xiao Wu nervously putting away the key in his hand, while Old Lu remained calm.
0:30:25|0:30:32|[Guo Zhui] looked at Wang Hai, smiling meaningfully. It seemed that there was a deep connection between the two, at the night market stall. [Old Lu] watched them.
0:30:59|0:31:6|[Xiao Wu] took out a red envelope from his pocket and pulled out the silver dollar inside.
0:31:6|0:31:14|[Guo Zhui] smiled and also took out an identical red envelope from his pocket.
0:31:19|0:31:24|Xiao Wu handed the red envelope to Guo Zhui without hesitation, then continued to eat noodles with full concentration.
0:31:24|0:31:30|Xiao Wu is having second thoughts again.
0:31:43|0:31:50|Xiao Wu looked at the bottle of wine cluelessly, afraid that he wouldn't be able to make a move at dinner tonight.
0:31:50|0:31:56|Seeing his bewildered look, both [Old Lu] and [Guo Zhui] laughed. On Flower Street.
0:32:19|0:32:23|[Xiao Yunque] is a famous fortune teller on Flower Street.
0:32:23|0:32:31|With stylish short hair and wearing sunglasses, seemingly blind. [Old Lu] wrote down the name and handed it to [Xiao Yunque].
0:32:31|0:32:39|[Xiao Yunque] took the note to the birdcage and showed it to the parrot inside. Then she opened the cage.
0:32:39|0:32:46|The parrot flew to the signboard, picked up a stack of divination slips, and [Xiao Yunque] fumbled to interpret them.
0:33:35|0:33:44|Xiao Yunque's eyes regained their sparkle.
0:34:2|0:34:12|[Guo Zhui] took out his and Xiao Wu's red envelopes. The smile faded from [Xiao Yunque]'s face, clearly she was in the know.
0:34:38|0:34:44|Boss Ding opens the magazine and pours out the bullets.
0:34:44|0:34:54|Leaving only one bullet, in front of the workers, putting that bullet back into the magazine, spinning the chamber, no one knows if the final shot will be fatal.
0:35:5|0:35:16|Boss Ding puts the gun against his own head, luckily, it's an empty chamber. Boss Ding opens the magazine again.
0:35:16|0:35:23|Reveal the bullets inside, proving that there are no tricks. A worker lowered his head nervously, as if he knew something.
0:35:32|0:35:39|Ayin was speechless and had no choice but to follow Boss Ding's rules. Boss Ding handed the gun to Old Chen. Old Chen took it.
0:35:39|0:35:43|Slowly walking towards Ayin, Old Lu threw the gun in front of Ayin.
0:35:43|0:35:51|Aying trembled as she picked up the gun, imitating [Boss Ding], pointing the muzzle at herself. The workers looked on in sorrow.
0:35:51|0:35:54|But he was not able to speak a fair word for her.
0:36:12|0:36:21|Ayin was shot and fell to the ground. [Chen Qi] secretly glanced at [Boss Ding], as if he had known this outcome long ago.
0:36:21|0:36:29|Boss Ding walked to Ah Yan's body, took out a bullet from her pocket, and held up the bullet as evidence of the crime.
0:36:48|0:36:54|Boss Ding pried open Ah Yan's mouth and stuffed the bullet that had been so painstakingly retrieved back into her mouth.
0:36:55|0:37:7|Lightning flashed and thunder roared in the sky, but inside the factory, there was dead silence, with everyone feeling threatened.
0:37:17|0:37:24|Old Lu questioned Guo Zhui, who lowered his eyes and began to ponder.
0:38:14|0:38:22|[Xiao Wu] walked to where [Xiao Yunque] was that night. [Xiao Wu] imitated [Xiao Yunque] and knelt down.
0:38:22|0:38:29|[Guo Zhui] imitated [Boss Ding] by taking out the gun and emptying all the bullets on the ground, while [Boss Ding] stood on the stairs looking down at everyone.
0:38:29|0:38:36|Guo Zhui hands the gun to Xiao Wu.
0:38:39|0:38:47|Boss Ding tapped the railing and walked down. Old Lu handed the gun to Xiao Wu as the worker instructed. Boss Ding applauded.
0:39:22|0:39:27|Old Lu handed the gun to Boss Ding without hesitation.
0:39:32|0:39:47|[Old Lu] smiled and holstered his gun, while [Boss Ding] put down his cigar, clasped his hands together, and solemnly bowed in all directions. Sensing something amiss, [Xiao Wu] hesitated, but [Old Lu] just smiled and remained calm.
0:40:4|0:40:11|Guo Zhui looked worriedly at Old Lu, and the three of them began their investigation.
0:40:34|0:40:43|The trio had just entered the tunnel when they heard a gunshot, and they quickly rushed to the source of the gunshot.
0:40:43|0:40:50|They pushed open an iron gate and entered deeper into the tunnel. [Guo Zhui] and [Xiao Wu] held their guns, alert to their surroundings.
0:40:51|0:40:58|At the end of the tunnel, a body appeared, sitting stiffly on a chair. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be Director Jin who had passed away.
0:40:59|0:41:9|Director Jin was shot in the chest. Guo Zhui checked the dropped gun on the ground. There were only two bullets left in the magazine, one of which was a blank.
0:41:9|0:41:13|[Guo Zhui] leaned in to smell the corpse.
0:41:17|0:41:23|[Xiao Wu] immediately ran over and closed the iron gate.
0:41:25|0:41:40|Old Lu stripped off Xiao Wu's coat, threw it on the ground, then squatted down, struck a match, and set his coat on fire. Smoke immediately billowed out. Xiao Wu also squatted down, looking at the burning coat, unable to understand Old Lu's intention.
0:41:40|0:41:47|Old Lu watched as the fire grew stronger and stronger, estimating in his heart that it was time. He slowly stood up.
0:41:47|0:41:55|On the side, [Xiao Wu] became even more confused, looking at [Old Lu] in puzzlement. Without saying a word, [Old Lu] extinguished the fire with his foot.
0:41:55|0:42:5|The smoke in the tunnel became thicker and spread around, lingering for a long time. [Guo Zhui] stood by the body, [Xiao Wu] curiously looked at [Old Lu], waiting for him to reveal the mystery.
0:42:5|0:42:14|[Old Lu] walked into the smoke, carefully observing it and determining the direction of the secret room, coming to his conclusion.
0:42:30|0:42:40|In the laboratory, [Li Jia] is dissecting the body of [Zhuo Ge]. She skillfully cuts open the skin of the body, digging layer by layer.
0:42:40|0:42:46|There is a break in the rib cage of the corpse's chest, and strangely, no bullets are found inside the body.
0:43:6|0:43:14|[Guo Zhui] moved the desk lamp over and leaned in to examine the body. Upon closer inspection, he discovered some clues.
0:43:14|0:43:24|The corpse's mouth was found to contain some fine threads. There were ligature marks on both wrists of the corpse.
0:43:24|0:43:39|Old Lu and Xiao Yunque returned to the scene of the crime. Xiao Wu imitated the killer, while Old Lu imitated the murdered Zhuo Ge. His hands were tightly bound with hemp rope, rendering him immobile. His mouth was gagged with a cloth, unable to call for help. Old Lu imagined the scene of Zhuo Ge's murder.
0:43:39|0:43:47|Feeling the fear he had faced before, [Old Lu] looked towards the ventilation shaft in the tunnel.
0:43:51|0:43:59|Old Lu's mouth was sealed, he could only sway his head from side to side, expressing himself incoherently.
0:43:59|0:44:5|Xiao Wu couldn't understand, Old Lu helplessly moved a chair and awkwardly jumped onto the ventilation duct with his legs.
0:44:5|0:44:14|Through the ventilation duct, Old Lu saw a person walking towards them, and Xiao Wu also went over to take a look.
0:44:27|0:44:29|Xiao Wu ran back to help Old Lu run together.
0:44:29|0:44:39|The iron gate was pushed open, and the factory's Old Yang sneaked in without noticing Old Lu and Xiao Wu hiding in the dark.
0:44:42|0:44:49|[Laoyang] burned incense and turned to see [Old Lu] sitting on a chair.
0:45:6|0:45:13|[Xiao Wu] held a pistol in his left hand and a specially made three-pronged wrench in his right hand, trying to use the wrench to remove the magazine.
0:45:13|0:45:18|The success came effortlessly.
0:45:18|0:45:24|Old Lu took the magazine and started to examine it, the truth seemed to be getting closer.
0:45:24|0:45:32|[Xiao Wu] brought [Old Lu] to [Guo Zhui]'s house. Just as they arrived at the door, they heard a gunshot.
0:45:34|0:45:43|[Old Lu] looked up at the sound. [Xiao Wu] knocked on the door. [Guo Zhui] opened the door to welcome the guest, with his gun never leaving his hand.
0:46:15|0:46:24|[Guo Zhui] created a lifelike fake ice bullet and shot it towards the dead pig hanging in the room, [Xiao Wu] ran to check.
0:46:26|0:46:41|[Guo Zhui] thought it was feasible, loaded the ice bullet into the crossbow and handed it to [Xiao Wu], letting [Xiao Wu] show off. [Xiao Wu] took it, aimed and fired.
0:46:41|0:46:51|Three people walked in to inspect. [Guo Zhui] picked up a tool and compared the size of the bullet holes at the shooting site.
0:46:53|0:47:1|[Old Lu] was somewhat disappointed, pacing back and forth, deep in thought.
0:47:29|0:47:46|Guo Zhui was pondering Old Lu's words, while Xiao Wu was completely out of it.
0:47:52|0:47:57|The three of them returned to the laboratory. Li Jia bent down to dissect the body carefully.
0:47:57|0:48:4|[Xiao Wu] curiously approached, stretched his neck, and stared intently, their heads getting closer and closer.
0:49:32|0:49:41|In the underground warehouse of the police station, [Old Lu] looked worriedly at the blackboard, which displayed a countdown.
0:50:17|0:50:39|[Xiao Wu] acted quickly, raised the envelope, and handed it to [Old Lu] who took it with confusion. [Xiao Wu] then smoothly took the gun from [Old Lu]'s hand and slipped away. [Old Lu] opened the envelope.
0:51:43|0:51:57|On the other end of the letter, Fu Yuan sat on the snow, her fingertips gently sliding on the snow, writing a character with great care. She looked at the character on the ground and smiled happily.
0:51:57|0:52:5|She finally shared this secret. On the other end, Old Lu finished reading the letter, the sunlight shining on him, stirring up his emotions.
0:52:5|0:52:14|Completely hidden. At night, with lightning and thunder, eerie sounds could be heard coming from the arsenal factory, gradually waking up the workers.
0:52:20|0:52:31|In an empty workshop, the machines were running but there was no one around. The workers gathered together, looking around. Suddenly, two lines of blood appeared on the ground, indicating the appearance of ghost bullets.
0:52:39|0:52:47|The streets were filled with curses, catching the attention of high-ranking officials from the Public Security Bureau. The workers collectively fled.
0:52:55|0:53:0|Director Jin accompanied the senior official to the police station, where the reporters had been waiting for a long time.
0:53:32|0:53:40|The workers refused to give up and started to rebel. The foreman began to use force against the workers.
0:53:40|0:53:50|Director Jin arrived when the situation was already out of control. Boss Ding stood with his hands on his waist and fired several shots into the air. The crowd fell silent.
0:54:11|0:54:20|Director Jin quickly intervened. He glanced at Boss Ding and signaled to have a private chat with him. Boss Ding arrogantly pursed his lips, clearly not taking even the director seriously.
0:54:20|0:54:28|The trio hid in the dark, observing. The bold and cautious [Old Lu] sneaked to a higher place, eavesdropping on the conversation between the two.
0:54:28|0:54:34|He always felt there was some kind of business relationship.
0:55:1|0:55:10|Boss Ding slapped Director Jin hard, but Director Jin remained calm, with a gun already pointed at Boss Ding's vital spot.
0:55:24|0:55:32|Took a sneak aim at Director Jin's head. [Boss Ding] pulled out a thick ledger from his pocket.
0:55:43|0:55:50|Old Lu accidentally flipped over while picking up a hat, he grabbed the railing and was about to lose his grip, falling down below. At the critical moment,
0:55:50|0:56:0|[Guo Zhui] arrived and grabbed him. [Old Lu] used the momentum to climb back up the stairs, looking down again, the person was already gone.
0:56:2|0:56:4|The newspaper sensationalizes the murder case, causing panic throughout the city.
0:56:33|0:56:43|Guo Zhui lowered his head in silence, while Old Lu looked a bit weary.
0:56:43|0:56:59|The trio arrived at the scene of the fire, looking at the debris all over the ground, it's not hard to imagine the raging fire at that time. The whole room was burned to the ground, leaving only an empty frame.
0:56:59|0:57:8|They carried oil lamps and walked into the ruins, where the ground was covered with charred furniture. [Guo Zhui] noticed something and walked over.
0:57:8|0:57:15|Squatting down slowly, Old Lu searched in the thick ashes, and then he found something shiny.
0:57:15|0:57:23|After clearing away the surface dust, it revealed a broken silver ring, and [Xiao Wu] holding the lamp discovered the key point.
0:58:1|0:58:10|There are dozens of graves of all sizes here, each one hastily covered with grass, without even a tombstone. Old Lu introduced them to him.
0:58:14|0:58:21|The three of them dug up the bones of the Tao family.
0:58:21|0:58:30|[Old Lu] unwrapped the grease-covered package containing the body, revealing the pitiful death of Xiao Tao. Unable to bear it, [Old Lu] turned his head away. He paused for a moment.
0:58:30|0:58:39|Continuing the autopsy, he opened Xiao Yunque's mouth, examined it, and then gently closed it. Though the body was silent, it spoke volumes of guilt.
0:59:1|0:59:12|Guo Zhui watched this scene with a heavy heart. It was late at night, and the three of them had unearthed several more bodies.
0:59:13|0:59:21|Xiao Wu, exhausted, jumped out of the burial pit. Old Lu walked around looking for clues.
0:59:22|0:59:31|The conclusion in my heart was indeed verified.
0:59:31|0:59:39|The three of them all thought of one person at the same time, the one who neatly folded the quilt for Wang Hai.
1:0:18|1:0:24|The hooligan then lit a candle.
1:0:26|1:0:31|[Xiao Yunque] grabbed a handful of bird feed and threw it on the ruffian's face.
1:0:32|1:0:40|She then opened the birdcage and released the parrot inside. The parrot flew straight towards the thug.
1:0:40|1:0:47|Pecking at the feed stuck on his face. Their leader Old Lu's face was bruised, and his eyes were pecked.
1:0:48|1:0:54|[Xiao Yunque] took the opportunity to escape, which thoroughly enraged the thugs, who chased after [Xiao Yunque] all the way.
1:0:54|1:0:59|[Guo Zhui] and [Old Lu] arrived at the scene, only to see the smashed stall.
1:0:59|1:1:5|[Xiao Yunque] ran for her life, with the thugs behind her catching up quickly. One of the thugs raised a gun and aimed it at [Xiao Yunque].
1:1:5|1:1:9|An innocent bystander was hit by a bullet, causing panic in the crowd.
1:1:9|1:1:15|[Xiao Yunque] didn't dare to stop for a moment, the bullets behind her could take her life at any time.
1:1:15|1:1:22|Chasing after them, the hooligans gathered more henchmen. Meanwhile, [Old Lu] and [Guo Zhui] rushed over following the commotion.
1:1:23|1:1:30|[Guo Zhui] rushed forward, immediately engaging in a scuffle with the opponent. He picked up one of them and slammed him against a street lamp, knocking him out cold.
1:1:31|1:1:39|The other thug left, took advantage of Old Lu's distraction, and locked his throat from behind. Old Lu pushed back and crashed into the window glass.
1:1:39|1:1:46|Seizing the opportunity to break free, turning the tables and knocking the thug to the ground. Meanwhile, [Xiao Yunque] ran until exhausted.
1:1:46|1:1:55|She hid in a smokehouse. The gang leader was persistent and ordered his men to search separately. This group of men happened to run into [Old Lu].
1:1:56|1:2:7|[Old Lu] acted quickly, immediately stepping on the brakes, turning around and pushing a yellow taxi to hide himself. However, the taxi got stuck halfway.
1:2:7|1:2:16|[Old Lu] slowly lifted the car curtain and found that the ones blocking the car were the henchmen of the ruffian. This was bad.
1:2:17|1:2:25|With immense strength, he single-handedly overturned the van, lifting [Old Lu] entirely and throwing him towards the nearby railing.
1:2:25|1:2:30|[Old Lu] reacted quickly, grabbing his subordinate and pulling him, causing the subordinate to hit his head on the safety bolt and pass out.
1:2:41|1:2:46|On the other side, the innkeeper mistook [Xiao Yunque] for a thief and dragged her out.
1:2:46|1:2:53|The commotion attracted the gang leader, and [Xiao Yunque] had to continue fleeing. She ran into an alleyway.
1:2:53|1:2:58|The gang leader held a gun to block her way. [Guo Zhui] arrived.
1:2:58|1:3:2|Seeing [Xiao Yunque] falling into the hands of the thugs, he immediately opened fire.
1:3:4|1:3:9|The thug grabbed [Xiao Yunque] and shot at the feet of [Guo Zhui].
1:3:9|1:3:18|The bullet fell at the feet of [Guo Zhui], but he remained motionless with the gun in his hand, aiming at his prey.
1:3:18|1:3:28|His bullet hesitated, afraid of injuring the hostage. [Guo Zhui] slowly pulled the safety catch.
1:3:28|1:3:34|The thug hid in the alley, too far away. He had to concentrate, aim at his prey, and hit the bullseye.
1:3:45|1:3:52|[Guo Zhui] calmly took a shot and hit the target accurately, the thug's forehead was hit, and his life came to a sudden end.
1:3:52|1:4:1|Old Lu arrived and witnessed Guo Zhui's marksmanship firsthand. Guo Zhui rushed over, Xiao Yunque was startled and fainted in his arms.
1:4:1|1:4:9|The next day, [Guo Zhui] settled [Xiao Yunque] at home and helped her take medicine. [Xiao Yunque] wrapped in a blanket, lazily leaned on the sofa.
1:4:10|1:4:18|She looked at [Guo Zhui] with her head tilted, unable to hide the joy on her face. [Guo Zhui] casually asked.
1:4:20|1:4:28|Xiao Yunque's gaze stayed closely on Guo Zhui without a moment's pause.
1:4:56|1:5:8|[Xiao Yunque] focused on [Guo Zhui], understanding what he was considering.
1:5:8|1:5:16|[Xiao Yunque]'s eyes were full of tenderness, which made [Guo Zhui] a bit at a loss. He was surprised that the delicate girl in front of him,
1:5:16|1:5:23|His feelings for her were surprisingly firm, he used to be a soldier, accustomed to a life of gunfire and battles.
1:5:23|1:5:31|Once his life was meant for the battlefield, now it is used to protect the justice of Tiancheng County. He is determined to uphold the justice in his heart.
1:5:31|1:5:39|One cannot put down the gun. A person who is always accompanied by a gun cannot expect to have a family. [Guo Zhui] gently lifts [Xiao Yunque]'s face.
1:5:39|1:5:47|Looking at her, wanting to make sure she understood that the man in front of her couldn't give her anything. [Xiao Yunque] smiled,
1:5:47|1:5:55|Full of happiness on her face. It's obvious that she is braver than [Guo Zhui]. [Guo Zhui] admitted defeat, and warmth gradually appeared in his eyes.
1:5:56|1:6:3|He gently kissed her face, this kiss was [Guo Zhui]'s promise. From then on, he had an extra concern.
1:6:3|1:6:11|They nestled closely to each other, their ears rubbing against each other. The sunlight shone on Xiao Yunque's skin, making her stand out.
1:6:11|1:6:19|More charming and lovely. [Guo Zhui] couldn't help but kiss her, and this kiss spread all the way, becoming more and more passionate. Inside the room,
1:6:19|1:6:28|Gradually warming up, their clothes slipped to the ground as they met each other candidly. At this moment, their hearts were in perfect harmony.
1:6:28|1:6:29|They have each other.
1:6:29|1:6:44|In the police station basement, [Old Lu] raised the gun, pressed it to his ear, and listened carefully to the sound of flicking the safety catch. He seemed to be imitating someone else firing a gun. Then, he put down the gun and carefully studied its structure.
1:6:44|1:6:51|He opened the magazine, put in a bullet, spun the chamber, and [Old Lu] listened carefully, trying to guess the position of the bullet.
1:6:51|1:7:6|With only two days left until the bet with [Boss Ding], [Old Lu] decided to take a gamble. He took a deep breath, pointed the gun at himself, pressing it against his temple. He resisted, tilting his head to the side, and finally moved the gun away.
1:7:7|1:7:16|The gun went off, narrowly missing Old Lu. Xiao Wu heard the sound and ran over.
1:7:29|1:7:33|The night market hasn't opened yet, but the small stalls are already crowded with people.
1:7:33|1:7:41|Everyone was watching [Old Lu] trying to crack the secret of the ghost bullet. [Old Lu] loaded a bullet into the magazine, chambered it,
1:7:41|1:7:50|He pointed the gun at himself. This time he didn't hesitate, he pulled the trigger directly, but there was no gunshot. [Old Lu] breathed a sigh of relief.
1:7:50|1:7:56|He opened the magazine again and poured out the bullet in front of everyone.
1:7:56|1:8:3|He repeated the process, loading the bullets into the gun. He handed the pistol to [Xiao Yunque], instructing it to pass it to [Guo Zhui].
1:8:3|1:8:10|[Xiao Yunque] hesitated for a moment, but still did as told. [Guo Zhui] took the gun and pointed it at himself. [Xiao Yunque] immediately grabbed him.
1:8:11|1:8:17|Guo Zhui smiled apologetically. Old Lu walked over and took the gun.
1:8:18|1:8:24|He fired six shots from his gun.
1:8:30|1:8:35|[Old Lu] took out a complete magazine, with six bullets neatly arranged on top.
1:8:35|1:8:39|He then proceeded to demonstrate how to load these six bullets in front of everyone.
1:8:46|1:8:49|Boss Ding skillfully replaced the magazine.
1:9:18|1:9:28|The curse of the ghost bullet is broken on its own, the murderer may still be active, and [Xiao Wu] remembered Lao Yang, the worker who worshipped Zuo Ge.
1:9:28|1:9:33|It was only under his guidance that they discovered the mystery of the magazine.
1:9:42|1:9:51|It's okay not to care, whether it's with the mysterious person or not, who shot and killed Old Yang.
1:9:53|1:10:4|The trio arrived at the ammunition depot, where a mysterious person shot at them, forcing them to retreat. [Guo Zhui] missed the opportunity to shoot as he stumbled, but he got up and continued the pursuit. [Old Lu] discovered the body of Lao Yang.
1:10:5|1:10:13|The mysterious person ran outside, followed closely by [Guo Zhui], who was about to draw his gun but was preempted by the police. Li Jin, unbeknownst to anyone, was lying in ambush there.
1:10:14|1:10:21|Shortly after, [Boss Ding] and [Director Jin] arrived with their respective subordinates, and [Guo Zhui] hurried forward to check.
1:10:21|1:10:30|The mysterious person lay on the ground, barely breathing.
1:10:31|1:10:39|Director Jin's confidant, Nan Cheng, rushed over and strangled the opponent. Boss Ding walked unsteadily in front of everyone.
1:11:6|1:11:12|Director Jin on the side took out a police baton and gave each of them a hit.
1:11:13|1:11:21|Everyone present was overwhelmed by his momentum. At this moment, [Xiao Wu] understood what it means to have the power to cover the sky with one hand.
1:11:23|1:11:31|The crowd dispersed, and [Nan Cheng] pointed at [Guo Zhui]. [Guo Zhui] noticed something on his ring finger.
1:11:31|1:11:39|There is a mark left by a ring worn for years. The mystery unraveled, the ring left in the fire scene, it belongs to him.
1:11:40|1:11:47|[Nan Cheng] drove away, but halfway through the journey, his car was hit and stopped by another car that suddenly swerved in front of him. [Nan Cheng] passed out.
1:11:47|1:11:54|It was the trio who ran into him. They tied [Nancheng] up, hanging him upside down from the ceiling beam.
1:12:10|1:12:19|[Xiao Wu] released the rope holding [Nan Cheng], and just as he was about to hit the ground, he grabbed the rope again, pulled him up, and continued to hang on.
1:12:34|1:12:50|Once again on the brink of death, this time his head was even closer to the ground, and he was so scared that he foamed at the mouth.
1:13:3|1:13:9|[Guo Zhui] insisted on shooting at [Xiao Wu], who fell down after being shot, releasing the rope.
1:13:52|1:13:58|[Old Lu] dragged him into the shadows. [Xiao Wu] opened his coat to reveal the bulletproof vest underneath.
1:14:1|1:14:4|Old Lu settled Xiao Wu before circling back to find Guo Zhui.
1:14:4|1:14:11|Little did they know, there were assassins ambushed in the corridor, and [Old Lu] was strangled by a cable around his neck, hanging him up.
1:14:11|1:14:17|The killer tied the cable into a knot and bound it to a wooden stake, leaving [Old Lu] to fend for himself.
1:14:19|1:14:26|Old Lu was shot in a vital spot by the hidden assassin in the southern city. Bullets were flying from all directions, and there was more than one assassin.
1:14:26|1:14:34|[Guo Zhui] quickly ducked behind the wall, seeking cover. Hearing the gunshots, [Xiao Wu] couldn't sit still and drew his gun. Meanwhile, [Old Lu] struggled to survive.
1:14:34|1:14:41|He grabbed the cable, exerted all his strength, lifted himself up in the air, and then, performed a backflip with a hanging golden hook.
1:14:41|1:14:43|The cable loosened, and [Old Lu] was finally rescued.
1:14:43|1:14:50|The assassin group has locked onto Guo Zhui's location, they gathered together and concentrated their firepower to shoot at the place where Guo Zhui was located.
1:14:50|1:14:54|The enemy has strong firepower and a numerical advantage.
1:14:54|1:15:2|[Guo Zhui] hid behind the wall that was almost shot through, with debris flying everywhere. He could only temporarily lie in wait for the opportunity to counterattack.
1:15:2|1:15:10|The enemy was determined to win, firing the machine gun wildly. As the wall collapsed, [Guo Zhui] had to crawl on the ground, tightly suppressed by the opponent.
1:15:10|1:15:18|At that moment, [Xiao Wu] circled around behind the assassins and shot one of them. The assassin was hit and immediately turned around to shoot at [Xiao Wu].
1:15:18|1:15:25|[Guo Zhui] seized the opportunity, immediately opened fire, and successfully shot one of the opponents. The assassins were thrown into chaos and forced to scatter.
1:15:25|1:15:35|At this moment, it's a race of speed, which happens to be [Guo Zhui]'s strong suit. In the blink of an eye, he kills another person, climbs up the stairs, and seizes the high ground.
1:15:35|1:15:43|On the other side, [Old Lu] also arrived and joined the battle. He hid in the corner and ambushed the assassin, then pounced on him when he least expected it.
1:15:43|1:15:51|Pressing down hard on the opponent, rolling down the slope, completely subduing them. [Guo Zhui] stood at a high place, observing the enemy's every move.
1:15:51|1:15:58|The enemy was still searching for him everywhere, while he had already raised his gun and aimed at the other side. Another casualty.
1:15:58|1:16:6|The assassin group was in complete chaos this time, shooting wildly. [Old Lu] peeked out and spotted one of the assassins.
1:16:8|1:16:16|The other party saw that he had a gun in his hand and immediately hid behind the wall. This movement attracted [Guo Zhui], who agilely circled behind the assassin and shot him in the head.
1:16:16|1:16:23|Xiao Wu is also engaging with the enemy, diverting fire for [Guo Zhui]. [Guo Zhui] seizes the opportunity to pursue, charging towards the last assassin.
1:16:24|1:16:28|Both sides have run out of bullets in their magazines, but [Guo Zhui] only loaded one bullet.
1:16:28|1:16:36|He approached the enemy, who hadn't reacted yet, and had already become a dead soul under the gun. The trio regrouped.
1:16:38|1:16:47|Nancheng is dead, and now the clues are cut off again. The enemy is relentless, hiding in the dark and shooting wildly, reigniting the battle. Bullets are sweeping the area where the three are located.
1:16:47|1:16:56|[Guo Zhui] raised his gun to fight back, but the other party had already disappeared without a trace, leaving only messy footprints on the ground. [Old Lu] ran to find Xiao Wu and saw him struggling to stand up.
1:16:56|1:16:59|The whole person looked dazed and terrified.
1:16:59|1:17:2|Xiao Wu smiled and answered Old Lu.
1:17:4|1:17:12|Suddenly, blood gushed from his neck. [Old Lu] quickly covered his wound, and Xiao Wu felt all his strength drained away.
1:17:12|1:17:23|Old Lu slowly sat down on the ground. Guo Zhui looked at him with a heavy heart.
1:17:54|1:18:1|Xiao Wu left with a smile on his face, leaving behind a look of contentment.
1:18:1|1:18:4|Smiling. To him, [Old Lu],
1:18:4|1:18:12|The puzzle that had been troubling him for a long time was finally solved. He believed that his partner would also be able to solve the remaining puzzles.
1:18:12|1:18:22|The meaning of death is too heavy, he was still so young, originally had plenty of time to experience the beauty of the world, and a budding romance.
1:18:22|1:18:29|With his departure, everything came to an abrupt end. It was all too unfair for him, but he used his kindness.
1:18:29|1:18:34|Accepted death calmly. [Old Lu]'s hands were still stained with [Xiao Wu]'s blood.
1:18:34|1:18:43|The blood is hot, but [Xiao Wu]'s body is cold. He has always been a reserved person, rarely expressing his emotions outwardly.
1:18:43|1:18:47|But now, his face is filled with unstoppable sorrow.
1:18:48|1:18:55|[Guo Zhui] stood still, motionless, his face filled with disbelief, unable to accept the fact that [Xiao Wu] had left.
1:19:0|1:19:5|Li Jin rushed in with his men and looked at the body on the ground.
1:19:12|1:19:16|He accused vehemently. [Guo Zhui] noticed something unusual on his shoes.
1:19:16|1:19:24|The mud on his shoes is enough to prove that he is the murderer of [Xiao Wu]. [Guo Zhui] raised his fist and swung it.
1:19:35|1:19:40|[Guo Zhui] shook off the people following him, filled with anger but nowhere to vent it at the moment.
1:19:40|1:19:48|Xiao Wu and Nancheng were buried together, in a decent cemetery, with the symbol of honor, a police cap, buried with them.
1:19:48|1:19:56|The people from the police station came to see them off. [Guo Zhui] and [Old Lu] stood at the front of the line, mourning for [Xiao Wu].
1:20:0|1:20:6|The skills on his face, Director Jin has always been impeccable. After the funeral,
1:20:6|1:20:13|Guo Zhui and Old Lu leave side by side.
1:21:23|1:21:32|They reexamined the three bodies. [Old Lu] held surgical forceps and carefully examined the broken ribs.
1:21:32|1:21:39|The deceased had some shattered ribs in the body, lodged in the lungs. These broken bones are all small in size, only the size of a fingernail.
1:21:39|1:21:48|He cleaned it slowly with a magnifying glass. At that moment, he found a piece of bone with a unique shape, and he used surgical forceps to peel back a corner of the lung.
1:21:48|1:21:56|Picked up the broken bones hidden underneath. The surface of the broken bones was stained with dried blood, and [Old Lu] put it into a beaker and cleaned it up.
1:21:56|1:22:3|The peculiar fragment of bone finally revealed its complete true appearance. Unlike other bone fragments, it has a smooth cut surface.
1:22:33|1:22:40|In Wang Hai's room, there is a complete set of equipment for making bullets, and there are also some pig leg bones that have been hollowed out on the table.
1:22:47|1:22:49|Director Jin and others waited in a car outside the factory.
1:22:50|1:22:57|They had predicted the location where the case would happen in advance. Inside the factory, [Boss Ding] sat on the sofa, leisurely smoking a cigar.
1:22:57|1:23:2|Wang Haishou stood by as [Boss Ding] got up and walked to the cabinet filled with Western liquor.
1:23:2|1:23:9|He patted the green wooden box on the shelf, which contained his collection of antique guns. He opened the lid.
1:23:9|1:23:23|Wang Hai quietly pulled out a gun behind him, and [Boss Ding], through the mirror, sensed the danger and immediately pulled out his antique gun.
1:23:32|1:23:38|Wang Hai shot [Boss Ding] with lightning speed. The people at the police station heard the gunshot and immediately sprang into action.
1:23:38|1:23:42|The factory gate was wide open, and they entered unimpeded.
1:23:42|1:23:49|Wang Hai tidied up the room and, without dealing with Boss Ding's body, calmly opened the window.
1:23:50|1:23:58|Later, he took out the coaster on the table and bit it. He leaned against the wall, gritted his teeth, and shot himself in the arm.
1:23:58|1:24:6|Create a scene of being injured by the killer. The police rushed in, holding a gun and pointing at the window, signaling the killer to escape from there.
1:24:6|1:24:12|A group of plainclothes officers rushed into the house, quickly searched around, and then retreated after confirming that Boss Ding was dead.
1:24:12|1:24:20|[Wang Hai] sat on the side, quietly watching them perform. [Director Jin]'s team gathered inside the factory, attracting all the workers to come out and watch.
1:24:20|1:24:30|Li Jin reported the inspection results to [Director Jin]. Wang Hai put away the gun and left the scene.
1:24:31|1:24:34|Old Lu and Guo Zhui arrived at the factory and blocked his way.
1:24:34|1:24:40|[Wang Hai] saw them and was somewhat surprised. [Guo Zhui] looked at him expressionlessly, and they stood there facing each other in a stalemate.
1:24:40|1:24:47|[Wang Hai] knew that even former comrades like [Guo Zhui] would not hesitate to shoot at each other for the sake of justice. [Wang Hai] fired at the two of them.
1:24:48|1:24:55|[Guo Zhui] pushed aside [Old Lu], but the bullet hit his left wrist.
1:24:55|1:24:57|[Wang Hai] took the opportunity to escape.
1:24:57|1:25:0|He ran all the way, and when he got anxious, he shot and killed the workers blocking the road.
1:25:0|1:25:8|[Guo Zhui] and [Old Lu] chased all the way to the ammunition depot, they split up and entered the depot from two entrances, one in front and one behind.
1:25:8|1:25:14|[Guo Zhui] caught up with Wang Hai first, and both of them had no way out. They had to face each other head-on.
1:25:14|1:25:21|Wang Hai has been hiding in the shadows, lurking by [Boss Ding]'s side, his gun almost as fast as [Guo Zhui]'s.
1:25:21|1:25:28|The atmosphere became tense. At this moment, [Old Lu] rushed in from another entrance, running so fast that he couldn't stop in time.
1:25:28|1:25:36|Directly sliding between the two, the three of them almost stood in a straight line. [Old Lu], standing in the middle, undoubtedly became a live target.
1:25:36|1:25:46|He looked at [Guo Zhui] with trust in his eyes, fully aware of his own situation.
1:25:48|1:25:57|Old Lu decided to help Guo Zhui by diverting the opponent's attention. He reached into his pocket in a gesture of pulling out a gun, while at the same time, Guo Zhui and Wang Hai fired their guns simultaneously.
1:25:57|1:26:11|The bullets grazed past [Old Lu], with one hitting Wang Hai's head and the other hitting [Guo Zhui]'s shoulder, in a showdown between the fastest gunmen. They are betting on their names, and now the winner has been decided.
1:26:11|1:26:16|The losing side lost their life. Wang Haitou fell to the ground with blood gushing from his head.
1:26:16|1:26:23|With his fall, the case of the ghost bullet was finally solved. It was time for rewards and recognition.
1:26:23|1:26:29|Director Jin led his superiors to the scene and rushed to the body, eager to take credit.
1:26:54|1:27:0|Director Jin grabbed Old Lu by the collar with a strong grip, full of threatening intent. Old Lu showed no sign of backing down.
1:27:0|1:27:8|There have been too many senseless deaths along this road, including his good brother, [Xiao Wu]. He will not let the mastermind behind the scenes escape justice.
1:27:9|1:27:18|He pulled out a blood-stained notebook from Wang Hai. Director Jin was speechless.
1:27:18|1:27:30|Old Lu's hand is holding Boss Ding's account book. Boss Ding once used it to blackmail him, he won't forget. There have been too many confused accounts between him and Boss Ding over the years, a single transaction could cost him his official position.
1:27:30|1:27:37|With the superior present and solid evidence against him, he couldn't possibly deny it. [Director Jin] left calmly with a stern face.
1:27:37|1:27:42|His steps were steady, as if accepting the reality of each step.
1:27:42|1:27:50|Li Jin lowered his hat as Director Jin exited, but Old Lu didn't forget Xiao Wu's cause of death. It was Li Jin who made the move that day.
1:27:53|1:27:58|[Li Jin] was completely panicked, kept retreating, and fell into the cart filled with ammunition.
1:27:58|1:28:5|The superior glanced at the little notebook in Old Lu's hand.
1:28:6|1:28:15|The cover, stained with blood, was almost identical to Boss Ding's account book. Director Jin looked at Old Lu with admiration.
1:28:15|1:28:24|On the other side, Director Jin is still not giving up, he has taken several workers hostage. When Guo Zhui arrives, he sees him holding a hand grenade.
1:28:34|1:28:50|Director Jin circled behind Guo Zhui, pretending to pull the pin of the grenade. Guo Zhui immediately shot to stop him, but it was too late, the fuse had been pulled.
1:28:57|1:29:4|He quickly called out to [Old Lu] who was about to enter the door. The explosion began, and a huge fire came rushing towards them.
1:29:4|1:29:9|A strong hot wind suddenly blew, sending [Old Lu] flying out.
1:29:9|1:29:16|The exit was blocked by a big fire, and there was still a lot of gunpowder stored in the ammunition depot, which was ignited by sparks flying around.
1:29:16|1:29:22|The explosions were continuous, and the fire was approaching. [Guo Zhui]'s first reaction was to protect the female worker beside him.
1:29:22|1:29:29|He picked up a shield and carried it on his back to block the fire. The explosions around them became more and more severe, trapping them in the sea of fire.
1:29:29|1:29:37|The female workers were trembling with fear, unable to move. They had no way out and could only grit their teeth and charge through the sea of fire.
1:29:37|1:29:43|[Guo Zhui] tightly held the female worker, protecting her all the way and shielding her from the raging fire. He displayed great bravery.
1:29:43|1:29:50|Even in such a dangerous moment, he never gave up on saving people. Perhaps for him, saving people is almost an instinct.
1:29:50|1:29:59|On the other side, [Old Lu] regained consciousness, trembling as he struggled to get up. The raging fire burned fiercely as he anxiously searched for [Guo Zhui].
1:29:59|1:30:6|At this moment, he saw two figures rushing out from the flames, but his joy only lasted for a second. The explosion was not over yet.
1:30:6|1:30:15|[Guo Zhui] was carrying a piece of wood that had been blown to pieces, almost using his own flesh and blood to withstand the fire. Another batch of ammunition was detonated.
1:30:15|1:30:28|Jets of huge flames shot out, with a scorching heat wave sweeping in, unstoppable. The entire ammunition depot was in imminent danger, countless rocks falling down, and another explosion chased after near the exit.
1:30:29|1:30:36|[Guo Zhui] and the female worker were knocked down to the ground. In the blink of an eye, he quickly helped the female worker up and pushed her forward along the way.
1:30:36|1:30:42|Just before the next explosion, he finally got her to a safe place. [Old Lu] rushed over and caught her at the exit.
1:30:42|1:30:49|The explosion erupted again, and the fierce flames burst out like a giant python. The heat wave that followed knocked [Guo Zhui] unconscious.
1:30:50|1:30:58|He is lying unconscious on the ground, his life hanging by a thread. He spared no effort to save others, but now he has little strength left to save himself.
1:30:58|1:31:6|The explosion continued, and the ammunition depot was completely reduced to ruins. It seemed that all the evil had come to an end in this raging fire.
1:31:7|1:31:14|[Guo Zhui] was seriously injured and fell into a coma, and was urgently taken to the hospital for treatment.
1:31:16|1:31:24|Accompanied by [Old Lu] and [Xiao Yunque], as well as high-ranking officials from the Public Security Bureau, [Guo Zhui] excelled in this case, with everything he did being closely observed.
1:31:24|1:31:31|Everyone was waiting outside the emergency room, waiting for [Guo Zhui]. [Xiao Yunque] was in a state of confusion, hiding in a corner and crying.
1:31:31|1:31:39|She was completely focused on [Guo Zhui], to her many things didn't matter, being able to be by his side was the most important.
1:31:40|1:31:48|[Old Lu] stood aside watching her, feeling the sincere friendship between [Xiao Yunque] and [Guo Zhui]. He felt a bit weary.
1:31:48|1:31:56|Slowly, he leaned against the wall. At this moment, his expression was very serious, as if he was not just worried about his brother's safety.
1:31:56|1:32:5|The surgery was over, [Old Lu] walked up to [Xiao Yunque]. Overwhelmed with joy, [Xiao Yunque] nodded repeatedly.
1:32:5|1:32:12|Thank God [Guo Zhui] was spared. After surviving the robbery, a grand appointment is waiting for him.
1:32:18|1:32:26|He put on Director Jin's uniform, and everyone cheered for him, except for Old Lu who was absent. He stayed in the office, reading Fu Yuan's reply.
1:32:55|1:32:59|[Old Lu] is lost in memories.
1:33:10|1:33:17|[Old Lu] waited for [Guo Zhui]'s reaction. He avoided [Old Lu]'s gaze and looked around absentmindedly.
1:33:21|1:33:24|[Old Lu] pondered for a long time, as if making a decision.
1:33:24|1:33:31|He returned to Director Jin's room again, this time searching for evidence alone, not missing any details.
1:33:31|1:33:39|In the drawer, he found some red envelopes, which [Old Lu] remembered as the kickbacks from the police station, the hush money mentioned by [Guo Zhui].
1:33:39|1:33:54|At the inauguration ceremony on the other end, [Guo Zhui] stood on the stage with a confident smile, while [Xiao Yunque] also transformed into a glamorous outfit and happily watched [Guo Zhui] from below the stage. [Old Lu] then arrived at [Guo Zhui]'s residence, standing in front of the fireplace inspecting it.
1:33:54|1:34:0|The charcoal inside is neatly stacked, and the walls are clean without any traces of smoke.
1:34:0|1:34:8|Various signs all suggest that this fireplace has a hidden purpose. [Old Lu] discovered that one of the tiles showed signs of being pried open.
1:34:8|1:34:16|He lifted the tile and found a hidden compartment underneath. The missing account book of [Boss Ding] was hidden in this compartment.
1:34:16|1:34:25|Old Lu's gaze was then drawn to the wall inside the house, covered with countless bullet holes left by Guo Zhui's research on ghost bullets.
1:34:25|1:34:42|[Old Lu] was digging in the bullet hole with tweezers. As he dug deeper, a bone bullet dropped out. Blowing away the dust on the bullet, the true form of the ghost bullet appeared. He had to face a fact that [Guo Zhui] was involved in the whole case.
1:34:42|1:34:53|Guo Zhui has already entered Director Jin's office. His subordinate respectfully brings a letter, Guo Zhui takes the letter and finds that it is from Old Lu.
1:34:53|1:34:57|Only investigating a case could make him so serious.
1:35:18|1:35:28|Before parting, [Guo Zhui] kissed [Xiao Yunque], with tenderness in her eyes as she watched him leave. [Guo Zhui] passed through the tunnel and headed alone to the location agreed upon with [Old Lu].
1:35:28|1:35:34|The underground passage was very damp, with water pooling everywhere on the ground, making the path ahead muddy and treacherous.
1:35:34|1:35:40|Not long after walking a few steps, a gunshot was heard from deep inside the tunnel, and [Guo Zhui] reacted quickly by drawing his gun immediately.
1:35:40|1:35:51|He followed the sound of gunshots to the end of the tunnel to a secret room, the situation was exactly the same as when the trio first encountered it, the gunshots were coming from the secret room, but the room was empty.
1:35:51|1:35:59|[Guo Zhui] knew it was [Old Lu]'s habit to faithfully recreate the scene of the original murder. He arrived at the location where the body was found.
1:35:59|1:36:7|The chair that was placed at the scene is still in its original position. On the chair lies the ironclad evidence pointing to the killer.
1:36:7|1:36:15|Boss Ding's account book and bone bullets, Old Lu did crack the mystery of the secret room indeed, and only Guo Zhui knows where he is at the moment.
1:36:15|1:36:23|He arrived at the room located directly above the tunnel.
1:36:48|1:36:55|[Guo Zhui] was left with only one bullet. He decided to leave it to fate. [Old Lu] shook his head.
1:36:57|1:37:2|Guo Zhui still pressed the gun against his head. He didn't dodge, but pulled the trigger directly.
1:37:2|1:37:12|The first shot was a blank. He placed the gun on the table and pushed it towards [Old Lu].
1:37:21|1:37:28|Guo Zhui did not deny it, his reaction confirmed Old Lu's guess.
1:37:28|1:37:37|[Old Lu] still had some doubts to clarify. He picked up the gun on the table and pressed it against his own head. [Guo Zhui] could tell that [Old Lu] was a bit nervous.
1:37:37|1:37:45|He hoped that [Old Lu] would stop, but he didn't. [Old Lu] clumsily pulled the trigger, and the second shot was still a misfire.
1:37:45|1:37:51|Both of them breathed a sigh of relief. [Old Lu] handed the gun to [Guo Zhui].
1:37:58|1:38:1|Guo Zhui was very frank, and it was his turn to ask questions.
1:38:1|1:38:8|He raised the gun to his head, this time he hesitated a bit, no one could predict the will of heaven.
1:38:8|1:38:15|Fortunately, the third shot was a misfire. The gun was pushed back in front of [Old Lu].
1:38:26|1:38:48|It's [Old Lu]'s turn to ask a question. He picked up the gun and decisively pulled the trigger. The fourth shot was also a blank. This life-and-death gamble will continue.
1:39:3|1:39:11|The gun was still in [Old Lu]'s hand, and this time he had no intention of handing it over.
1:39:11|1:39:19|His actions took [Guo Zhui] by surprise, as if he could sense the atmosphere of death. [Old Lu] raised the gun and aimed it at himself.
1:39:21|1:39:29|Accepting the judgment of fate calmly. No one can predict the position of the bullet in the roulette. [Guo Zhui] lowered his head, unable to face the outcome.
1:39:29|1:39:35|In the end, Old Lu was left behind. Xiao Wu looked at Guo Zhui and asked the final question.
1:39:36|1:39:46|The secrets hidden in the heart are being slowly unearthed. [Old Lu] will not forget.
1:39:48|1:39:53|In times of danger, [Guo Zhui] had saved himself more than once.
1:40:15|1:40:31|[Old Lu] was furious. He had never imagined that [Guo Zhui] would use such a reason to justify himself. The justice he upheld turned out to be obtained at the cost of a few people's lives. [Guo Zhui] appeared somewhat inferior, and he did not try to defend himself anymore.
1:40:36|1:40:39|[Old Lu] raised his gun without mercy, this was his answer.
1:40:39|1:40:55|The eyes betrayed him, they were bloodshot with tears in them, [Guo Zhui] saw the inner struggle in him, he placed his backup gun on the table, reminding [Old Lu].
1:40:56|1:41:0|Shooting a gun is easy, but killing a friend is hard.
1:41:0|1:41:3|At this moment, both of them are facing such a choice.
1:41:4|1:41:9|They all knew very well that today, among them, only one could walk out of the room.
1:41:9|1:41:18|[Old Lu] did not put down the gun. [Guo Zhui] understood that [Old Lu] had made a choice, he wanted to stick to his original intention. He turned and walked away.
1:41:18|1:41:23|He can't shoot [Old Lu], he has already betrayed his original intention and can't make another mistake.
1:41:24|1:41:31|[Old Lu] stood behind [Guo Zhui], slowly aiming the gun at him. He knew that if he pulled the trigger and killed [Guo Zhui] today, he would live with it for the rest of his life.
1:41:31|1:41:38|They all couldn't let go. [Guo Zhui] didn't wait for the gunshot, he stopped with a smile. He looked out the window.
1:41:38|1:41:45|He remembered the way [Xiao Yunque] leaned on him, she was still waiting for him.
1:41:51|1:41:58|Gunshots rang out, echoing throughout the entire room.
1:41:58|1:42:3|[Old Lu] slowly lowered his gun, looking at [Guo Zhui] in disbelief.
1:42:3|1:42:8|In the end, [Guo Zhui] also made his choice. He was the fastest gunman in Tiancheng County.
1:42:8|1:42:16|This time, he also shot himself before [Old Lu], ending his own life. Good and evil are just a thought away.
1:42:16|1:42:24|Rather than facing the fact that he had turned bad, he couldn't bear to live on, and his body collapsed to the ground with a loud thud.
1:42:24|1:42:30|In the blink of an eye, Tiancheng County has lost another director. Soon, people will discover his body.
1:42:30|1:42:46|They saw the two wounds on his face, one from saving people in the explosion, the other fatal wound from his time as a villain. As one journey ended, [Old Lu] left Tiancheng County with his luggage.
1:42:46|1:43:0|The train was moving slowly, and at this moment, [Old Lu]'s mood was completely different from when he arrived. He opened the notebook he carried with him and saw the two lines he had written on it before: "There is no perfect crime, only good people gone bad."
1:43:1|1:43:8|Looking at these words, he felt a mix of emotions, as he had witnessed too much along the way. On the day he bid farewell to Fu Yuan,
1:43:8|1:43:19|She turned around and asked herself the question, answering it herself.
