0:3:12|0:3:17|In the alleyway, two little boys walked hand in hand to the entrance of the grocery store.
0:3:17|0:3:20|Younger brother Xiaochong excitedly stopped in front of the freezer.
0:3:27|0:3:33|Brother [A Xuan] led his younger brother Xiaochong into the grocery store, where the owner was dozing off.
0:3:33|0:3:37|[A Xuan] secretly opened the small drawer where the money was kept.
0:3:37|0:3:44|The little bug accidentally made a noise, and [A Xuan] quickly pulled out a few banknotes.
0:3:44|0:3:50|Before leaving, Fang Chongyu couldn't resist opening the freezer.
0:3:50|0:3:51|At this moment, the boss woke up.
0:3:57|0:4:0|The boss chased after the two of them from behind, cursing as they ran.
0:4:0|0:4:17|They accidentally bumped into an old lady on the way, Xiao Chongyu helped the old lady up and bowed to apologize.
0:4:17|0:4:23|The boss hugged Little Bug from behind, and [A Xuan] threw stones hitting the boss's head, allowing Little Bug to escape.
0:4:28|0:4:33|The two sat on the high steps eating popsicles, with the vast sea in front of them.
0:4:56|0:5:0|The little bug grew up unknowingly.
0:5:0|0:5:7|He pulled back the curtains and looked out the window with determination.
0:5:7|0:5:12|He was ready to go out with his backpack, and his father asked.
0:5:26|0:5:34|Dad took out a trophy from the cabinet and placed it in front of Little Worm.
0:5:35|0:5:37|Dad slammed the trophy on the ground.
0:5:50|0:6:0|Dad pointed at the bug's chest with his finger, and the bug argued back.
0:6:0|0:6:6|The little bug turned and ran out of the house, while Dad angrily swung his fist.
0:6:6|0:6:12|On the high school playground, the track team is training, and [Zhou Yiqing] rides a motorcycle straight to the edge of the track and stops.
0:6:14|0:6:21|Coach Pan saw him and signaled the players to stop. The players greeted Coach Pan.
0:6:21|0:6:26|Zhou Yiqing took off her helmet and walked to Coach Pan's side.
0:7:30|0:7:35|The little bug took out a marathon poster from the schoolbag and continued to stare at [A Xuan], asking.
0:7:57|0:8:3|[A Xuan] pushed the little bug to the ground, gave him a fierce look, and then ran off to training.
0:8:3|0:8:7|At this moment, [Fang Chongyu] walked over and reached out a hand to the little bug.
0:8:7|0:8:11|The little bug saw the scar on Fang Chongyu's arm and stood up.
0:8:17|0:8:19|He looked towards the direction where the track team was training.
0:8:19|0:8:24|Zhou Yiqing looked at him with a thoughtful expression.
0:8:24|0:8:32|The track team ran over, with the chubby one in the front kicking the little bug's backpack on the track to the side.
0:8:36|0:8:39|Zhou Yiqing tries to grab the angry little bug, but the bug shakes off his hand.
0:8:58|0:9:10|Little [Chong] ran away while chaos ensued, and [Coach Pan] ran over.
0:9:15|0:9:19|[Zhou Yiqing] walked up to the coach and watched the direction in which Xiao Chong ran.
0:10:5|0:10:9|Yiqing lowered her head in silence.
0:10:20|0:10:28|Fang Chongyu was amused by Coach Pan's words.
0:10:28|0:10:33|The smile on Fang Chongyu's face disappeared instantly.
0:10:33|0:10:39|Fang Chongyu turned his head and shouted at the team members.
0:10:39|0:10:43|The team members sitting on the ground stood up defiantly.
0:11:0|0:11:5|Under the gaze of [Fang Chongyu] and the team members, the two of them stood at the starting line.
0:11:5|0:11:10|The little bug pulled [Zhou Yiqing] to the inside of the runway, and [Zhou Yiqing] smiled as she accepted her gentlemanly gesture.
0:11:10|0:11:17|[A Xuan] walked forward to instruct the little bug.
0:11:17|0:11:21|[A Xuan] did not follow his brother's instructions.
0:11:21|0:11:23|[Zhou Yiqing] is ready in the starting position.
0:11:27|0:11:33|At the beginning, Xiao Chong took the lead, but the two did not open up a big gap.
0:11:33|0:11:40|[A Xuan] frowned when he noticed that the little bug was not on the inner circle.
0:11:40|0:11:49|In the final sprint stage, [Zhou Yiqing] started to exert force. Little Bug couldn't keep up and was overtaken by [Zhou Yiqing]. The team members clapped and cheered.
0:11:49|0:11:53|[Zhou Yiqing], who crossed the finish line, covered her chest and gasped for breath.
0:11:56|0:12:5|[A Xuan] walked over and patted the shoulder of the little bug.
0:12:5|0:12:12|The epidemic calmed down, took a breath, turned around, walked over, and jingled the keys.
0:12:12|0:12:17|The little bug was still unwilling, with [A Xuan] putting his arm around his shoulder.
0:12:17|0:12:20|The bug pushed [A Xuan] aside and took a few steps forward.
0:12:20|0:12:23|[A Xuan] looked at the little bug and left helplessly.
0:12:25|0:12:32|On the way home, [Fang Chongyu] sat on the back of [Zhou Yiqing]'s motorcycle and vented. [Fang Chongyu] jumped off the motorcycle, and [Zhou Yiqing] quickly hit the brakes.
0:12:56|0:13:6|[Zhou Yiqing] got off the car and watched as Xiaochong hobbled away, the wind tousling her hair and covering half of her face.
0:13:6|0:13:14|She made up her mind and shouted at the little bug.
0:13:31|0:13:48|[Zhou Yiqing] got on the motorcycle, turned around and threw a line, then changed the direction of the motorcycle and roared away. The bug with a helmet on shouted and chased after the motorcycle.
0:13:57|0:14:2|Upon returning to school, [Zhou Yiqing] cleared out a bit of space in the storage room for Xiaochong.
0:14:2|0:14:6|Seeing the panting little bug running back, [Zhou Yiqing] said.
0:14:18|0:14:25|[Zhou Yiqing] gave the little bug a glance, squatted down, struck a match, and lit the incense.
0:14:25|0:14:35|The little bug's gaze fell on [Zhou Yiqing]'s mouth, ears, and eyes, causing the corners of her mouth to unconsciously lift.
0:14:35|0:14:39|[Zhou Yiqing] looked up at the little bug, and the bug quickly dodged her gaze.
0:14:40|0:14:48|[Zhou Yiqing] blew out the match and stood up to walk to the left, the little bug also went left. When [Zhou Yiqing] turned right, the bug also turned right.
0:14:48|0:14:51|The strange tacit understanding between the two made the atmosphere a bit ambiguous.
0:14:51|0:14:53|The little bug sidled up to the table and sat down.
0:14:54|0:14:57|[Zhou Yiqing] turned around and threw a pillow at him.
0:14:57|0:15:4|[Zhou Yiqing] smiled and turned around, watching him leave with a twinkle in her eye.
0:15:4|0:15:11|At night, [A Xuan] knocked on the window of his girlfriend Xiao Ke.
0:15:15|0:15:17|[A Xuan] lay on the bed and complained.
0:15:59|0:16:3|[A Xuan] brought the pregnancy test stick in Xiaoke's hand up to his eyes.
0:16:3|0:16:6|[A Xuan] stood still.
0:16:6|0:16:10|In the early morning, [Zhou Yiqing] trains on the mountain path with a small bug.
0:16:10|0:16:17|After the training, Xiaochong painfully stretched her legs, while [Zhou Yiqing] read a book and pressed on her back.
0:16:33|0:16:38|The little bug didn't hold steady, almost causing [Zhou Yiqing] to fall down.
0:16:38|0:16:48|[Zhou Yiqing] extended her right index finger and poked it on her forehead.
0:17:1|0:17:4|The bug grabbed [Zhou Yiqing]'s hand and moved it away from its forehead.
0:17:4|0:17:15|[Zhou Yiqing] gave a wink, and the little bug smirked mischievously as it released its fingers and sat down.
0:17:15|0:17:18|[Zhou Yiqing] picked up a stick and hit the small bug with it.
0:17:24|0:17:36|The little bug was about to get up in helplessness, but was immediately stopped by [Zhou Yiqing] as he bent down.
0:17:36|0:17:43|[Zhou Yiqing] looked at the small bug's worn-out sneakers and asked.
0:17:43|0:17:51|[Zhou Yiqing] frowned, lost in thought.
0:17:56|0:18:5|At night, in the office, [Zhou Yiqing] takes out a shoebox from the drawer.
0:18:5|0:18:8|In the box are a pair of red sneakers.
0:18:8|0:18:22|She tenderly caressed these red sneakers, thinking of her brother.
0:18:50|0:18:54|Fang Chongyu's clothes have been soaked with sweat for most of it.
0:18:54|0:18:54|[Zhou Yiqing] looks at him.
0:19:10|0:19:16|In a gloomy old building, [Fang Chongyu] takes Xiao Ke to see the quack doctor for an abortion.
0:19:16|0:19:20|Xiao Ke clung tightly to Fang Chongyu's arm in fear.
0:19:20|0:19:21|Walking through the dilapidated corridor.
0:19:21|0:19:23|[Fang Chongyu] knocked on the door of the consultation room.
0:19:26|0:19:28|The two pushed open the door and entered.
0:19:43|0:19:49|[Fang Chongyu] sat by the hospital bed, and the strange doctor walked over to him and said.
0:19:59|0:20:3|Xiao Ke sobbed as he watched [A Xuan] leave.
0:20:3|0:20:8|The eccentric doctor sat down.
0:20:8|0:20:17|Outside the clinic room, [A Xuan] closed the door, regretfully pounding the wall, holding back tears.
0:20:17|0:20:24|After a moment of inner struggle, he rushed in and lifted Xiao Ke up from the sickbed.
0:20:24|0:20:25|The strange doctor turned around and shouted.
0:20:31|0:20:41|[A Xuan] sat on the bed in Xiaoke's house, Xiaoke's father was emotional.
0:20:41|0:20:51|Xiao Ke's father closed the door, sat across from [A Xuan], while Xiao Ke and his mother peeked anxiously through a crack in the door from outside.
0:20:51|0:20:56|They locked eyes for a moment, and [A Xuan] said sincerely.
0:20:59|0:21:11|Dad angrily beats [A Xuan], while Xiao Ke and Mom rush in to stop him.
0:21:11|0:21:20|Dad pushed Xiao Ke away, and [A Xuan] hurried over. Xiao Ke held his stomach, and [A Xuan] helped him onto a chair.
0:21:20|0:21:22|Xiao Ke shook his head and hugged A Xuan.
0:21:25|0:21:35|From this moment on, older brother [A Xuan] will shoulder the responsibility of a family, while younger brother Xiaochong can still pursue his dreams without any worries.
0:21:35|0:21:40|In the mountains and forests, small insects cross over mud puddles and overcome numerous obstacles.
0:21:40|0:21:49|On the beach, [Fang Chongyu] tied a rope around his waist and dragged a heavy tire to practice diligently. He swung his arms with force, his eyes determined.
0:21:49|0:21:55|After a while, Xiaochong was running on the road, with [Zhou Yiqing] riding a motorcycle beside him, timing him.
0:22:12|0:22:17|The little bug continued to run forward, and before long, it accidentally fell down.
0:22:17|0:22:21|[Zhou Yiqing] stopped the car, took off the helmet, and walked over to check the injuries.
0:22:28|0:22:33|Zhou Yiqing frowned as she looked at his bleeding knee.
0:22:46|0:22:52|Zhou Yiqing disdainfully punched Little Bug and then turned to get a medical kit from the motorcycle to hand it to Little Bug.
0:22:54|0:22:57|The little bug unzipped the zipper and searched inside for things one by one.
0:22:57|0:23:1|Yiqing helps Xiaochong with the wound.
0:23:1|0:23:5|The little bug grimaced in pain.
0:23:5|0:23:13|The bug poked his forehead with his right index finger.
0:23:13|0:23:17|Yiqing looked at [Zhou Yiqing], untied his shoelace, and tied it to the gauze.
0:23:23|0:23:42|Tightly tied a knot on purpose before, and patted the small bug's leg.
0:23:42|0:23:50|The little bug stood up and approached [Fang Chongyu], and the two of them awkwardly locked eyes.
0:23:50|0:23:51|The bug backed off a bit.
0:23:59|0:24:11|Zhou Yiqing gets on the motorcycle and puts on a helmet.
0:24:11|0:24:19|Zhou Yiqing started the motorcycle and left, Xiaochong took a few steps forward and shouted.
0:24:19|0:24:23|Zhou Yiqing parked the car in front of the orphanage, with A Xuan quietly following behind her.
0:24:25|0:24:30|Yiqing noticed that someone seemed to be following behind, but when she turned around, there was no one in sight.
0:24:30|0:24:36|She walked to the outside of the classroom, and a few children ran out from the classroom, followed by the principal who came out to remind them.
0:24:39|0:24:42|Yiqing gestured to the dean to keep it a secret.
0:24:49|0:24:52|Xiaomi saw the little bug, and Yiqing asked.
0:24:58|0:25:4|Xiaomi grabbed Yiqing, who leaned forward and whispered to Xiaomi.
0:25:4|0:25:19|In Xiaoke's home, [A Xuan] leans his head against Xiaoke's belly, shaking the plush teddy bear in his hand and talking to the baby inside the belly.
0:25:19|0:25:21|Xiao Ke took out a roll of money from behind Xiao Xiong.
0:25:34|0:25:37|[A Xuan] stood up and responded helplessly.
0:25:54|0:25:59|Xiao Ke turned his head angrily, and [A Xuan] also stubbornly didn't respond.
0:25:59|0:26:11|The little bug dressed in formal attire, holding a white rose, came to fulfill Yiqing's invitation.
0:26:11|0:26:15|Standing at the entrance of the restaurant, [Zhou Yiqing] adjusts her clothes in front of the glass.
0:26:15|0:26:19|[Zhou Yiqing] and Xiao Mi saw this scene inside and smiled at each other.
0:26:20|0:26:25|The little bug was outside the door, practicing what to say when meeting someone.
0:26:25|0:26:37|After speaking, he sighed, and [Zhou Yiqing] and Xiao Mi pushed open the door, trying to hold back their laughter.
0:26:37|0:26:40|Yiqin introduced Xiao Mi while holding her hand.
0:26:46|0:26:54|Xiaomi and Xiaochong made a secret gesture, and [Zhou Yiqing] smiled as she turned and walked into the room, while Xiaochong took two steps and then returned to close the door.
0:26:54|0:27:4|Xiaomi used her fingers to spread the cream on the little bug's nose, and [Zhou Yiqing] joined in the fun.
0:27:4|0:27:9|Xiaomi placed the hands of the two people together, patting Xiaochong's arm and said.
0:27:9|0:27:13|After Xiao Mi finished speaking and ran off, Xiao Chong smiled foolishly, and [Zhou Yiqing] reminded him.
0:27:20|0:27:32|Fang Chongyu holds Zhou Yiqing's right hand with his left hand, his right hand around her waist, while Zhou Yiqing's left hand rests on Fang Chongyu's right shoulder. They smile and dance sweetly to the music.
0:27:32|0:27:35|Xiaomi watched the two of them from a distance and also smiled happily.
0:27:48|0:27:54|As soon as the words fell, [Zhou Yiqing] stepped on a small bug.
0:27:54|0:27:58|Night falls, and the wonderful date is coming to an end.
0:27:58|0:28:5|[Zhou Yiqing] shields the sleeping Xiao Mi from the wind by propping open her coat with a small bug.
0:28:5|0:28:7|The little bug looked at [Zhou Yiqing] and asked.
0:28:30|0:28:36|In the past, lost in memories, he walked slowly into the classroom with a short ponytail.
0:28:39|0:28:50|Xiaomi, who was drawing, stopped her hand movements and stared intently at the wing-shaped scar on [Zhou Yiqing]'s chest, then suddenly burst into a happy smile.
0:28:50|0:28:54|She rushed over and tightly embraced [Zhou Yiqing].
0:28:55|0:28:57|[Zhou Yiqing] was startled.
0:29:8|0:29:12|Xiaomi happily embraced Yiqing.
0:29:12|0:29:16|Yiqing also hugged her.
0:29:18|0:29:22|At this moment, Xiao Mi woke up.
0:29:25|0:29:35|Come on, A Xuan put the coat on Zhou Yiqing and looked at her tenderly.
0:29:48|0:29:56|The little bug watched as [Zhou Yiqing] embraced Xiao Mi, holding a white rose in one hand and waving it.
0:29:56|0:30:3|The little bug happily turned around and made a fist with his right hand in a celebratory gesture.
0:30:3|0:30:8|Time flies, and in the blink of an eye, the child of Fang Chongyu and A Xuan is born.
0:30:8|0:30:14|In the hospital, they cuddled together, Xiao Ke took the baby, and the two of them happily looked at their daughter.
0:30:20|0:30:29|The doctor reminded [A Xuan] to pay attention to the precautions, and he thought about how the expenses for his family would increase, his face gradually becoming serious.
0:30:29|0:30:33|He had to come back to that strange and rundown clinic room once again.
0:30:33|0:30:36|The strange doctor said,
0:30:49|0:30:53|In the grocery store, [Xiao Chong] practices marching while buying things.
0:30:53|0:30:58|The shopkeeper pointed to his own head, thinking that [Xiao Chong]'s brain was not quite normal.
0:30:58|0:31:2|And [A Xuan] was chased by the robbers past the grocery store, seen by [Xiao Chong].
0:31:2|0:31:6|[Little Worm] dropped the goods in his hands and turned to chase after [A Xuan] out the door.
0:31:6|0:31:11|The owner and his wife of the grocery store curiously walked to the door to watch.
0:31:11|0:31:13|There are two or three bandits chasing after [A Xuan] outside.
0:31:15|0:31:44|[A Xuan] used his agile skills to climb over walls and crawl through holes, while the bandits were entangled by [Xiao Chong] following closely behind, attracting the attention of the bandit gang. The bandits saw a person rushing out halfway and identified him as [A Xuan]'s accomplice, so they attacked [Xiao Chong] from behind. [Xiao Chong] knocked them down one by one and continued to chase after [A Xuan]. Seizing the opportunity, [A Xuan] jumped down from the hidden path and intercepted [Xiao Chong], who mistakenly thought he was also a bandit and pressed him firmly against the wall.
0:31:46|0:31:49|The light of the street lamp allowed [A Xuan] to see [Little Bug].
0:31:49|0:31:51|[A Xuan] let go of his hand and asked sternly.
0:31:57|0:32:1|[A Xuan] took out a box of medicine from his pocket and shook it.
0:32:22|0:32:27|[A Xuan] turned around to leave, and [Xiao Chong] snatched the medicine.
0:32:27|0:32:33|[Fang Chongyu] spilled all the pills on the ground.
0:32:33|0:32:42|[A Xuan] ruthlessly beat [Xiao Chong], then snatched the wallet from him.
0:32:44|0:32:48|[A Xuan] took the money, threw the empty bag to [Xiao Chong], and ran away.
0:32:48|0:32:58|[Xiao Chong] clenched his fists angrily and smashed the wall.
0:32:58|0:33:6|In the campus storage room, [Xiao Chong] sat on the bed, staring blankly at the poster of the international marathon race on the headboard.
0:33:6|0:33:9|[Zhou Yiqing] pushed the door open and knocked on the shelf.
0:33:12|0:33:14|[Fang Chongyu] hurriedly puts on his pants.
0:33:14|0:33:28|[Zhou Yiqing] handed over a registration form.
0:33:28|0:33:38|[Little Bug] opened his arms, wanting to embrace [Zhou Yiqing].
0:33:38|0:33:41|Yiqing twisted the little bug's wrist and knocked him down to the ground.
0:33:43|0:33:47|The little bug crawled up and asked about Zhou Yiqing's shoes.
0:33:50|0:33:54|Xiao Chongyu wrapped the shoelace that Yiqing used to bandage his wound around his wrist.
0:33:54|0:34:1|Yiqing reached out to grab it, but the little bug dodged.
0:34:2|0:34:4|Yiqing held the pair of red shoes in her hands.
0:34:11|0:34:19|Xiao Chong just took out his new shoes, but Yi Qing left. Xiao Chong looked outside the door in confusion.
0:34:19|0:34:28|On a rainy day, Fang Chongyu was practicing on the runway, limping and throwing punches, and accidentally fell down.
0:34:28|0:34:34|Zhou Yiqing walked out the door, just opened the umbrella, and saw a small bug lying on the ground, she rushed over.
0:34:38|0:34:52|Yiqing holds an umbrella with one hand and struggles to help up a small insect with the other.
0:34:52|0:34:59|Zhou Yiqing dropped the umbrella and walked towards the relic room, supporting the small insect with both hands.
0:34:59|0:35:1|The doctor looked at [Fang Chongyu].
0:35:33|0:35:35|Yiqing raised her hand, but did not strike down.
0:35:35|0:35:35|Zhou Yiqing finished speaking and then turned around and left.
0:36:3|0:36:8|The next day at the competition venue, the contestants were all actively doing warm-up exercises.
0:36:8|0:36:17|Xiao Chong and [A Xuan] locked eyes, and [A Xuan] smirked, indicating Xiao Chong to pay attention to the tall black contestant ahead.
0:36:17|0:36:27|Fang Chongyu's left leg knee and calf are wrapped in bandages, he grits his teeth and perseveres, frowning as he looks towards the surrounding group of relatives and friends, but does not see the familiar figure from before.
0:36:27|0:36:36|Fang Chongyu used his right index finger to touch his forehead, just like the way Zhou Yiqing taught him, as he walked to the front row, waiting for the competition to begin.
0:36:36|0:36:43|The starting gun goes off, and amidst the cheers of the family and friends on both sides, the contestants run forward at their own pace.
0:36:43|0:36:51|Perhaps it was Xiao Yan's influence. Fang Chongyu started running at the front, with steady steps and even breathing, as if he hadn't been injured at all.
0:36:56|0:37:2|Not long after, [A Xuan] easily caught up and turned to him tirelessly.
0:37:2|0:37:13|The little bug gritted its teeth and surpassed [A Xuan], who then accelerated past the bug. In a marathon, a test of endurance, working together side by side will undoubtedly make it easier.
0:37:13|0:37:19|[A Xuan] accompanies and motivates Xiao Chong in his own way, running side by side with him past the midway water station.
0:37:21|0:37:27|In the latter part of the competition, [A Xuan] noticed that the speed of the little bug was slowing down, and the black athlete caught up.
0:37:32|0:37:37|The little bug was gradually becoming unbearable, and the footsteps were getting heavier.
0:37:37|0:37:40|The vengeful Little Fatty deliberately chased up from behind and knocked down Little Bug.
0:37:45|0:37:50|[A Xuan] heard these words and turned back anxiously, only to see a little bug that had fallen down.
0:37:50|0:37:53|She stopped in her tracks, hesitating.
0:37:53|0:37:56|She made up her mind and turned around to push Xiaopang out of the track.
0:37:56|0:38:1|He was beaten up severely.
0:38:1|0:38:6|The little bug stood up gritting its teeth, roaring, and limped forward desperately.
0:38:17|0:38:30|The little bug tried hard to catch up with one contestant after another, but with serious injuries, it didn't run far before falling down again.
0:38:30|0:38:36|He curled up in pain on the ground, looking despairingly at his left leg oozing blood, unable to stand up.
0:38:36|0:38:43|At this moment, [Zhou Yiqing] walked over and reached out a hand to him, just like they first met on the playground.
0:38:43|0:38:45|The little bug looked up at [Zhou Yiqing].
0:39:9|0:39:15|The black contestant was the first to reach the finish line amidst the cheers and applause from the audience.
0:39:15|0:39:16|The second one is [A Xuan].
0:39:18|0:39:28|The crew draped a towel over [A Xuan], who watched the black athlete and his family celebrating nearby. Feeling unwilling to accept defeat, [A Xuan] angrily threw the towel to the ground.
0:39:34|0:39:38|In the school storage room, [Zhou Yiqing] helps to secure the brace for the little bug.
0:39:53|0:39:57|Previously, Fang Chongyu glanced at the little bug and then lowered his head in silence.
0:40:40|0:40:45|The little bug sighed and looked into [Zhou Yiqing]'s eyes, asking.
0:40:59|0:41:1|The epidemic bowed its head and pulled up the zipper of the medical bag.
0:41:25|0:41:37|A bug rolled up Zhou Yiqing's sleeve and slid its finger over the scar.
0:41:37|0:41:41|The little bug paused, and [Zhou Yiqing] stared into his eyes.
0:41:45|0:42:1|Xiao Chong and [Zhou Yiqing] gazed deeply into each other's eyes, as Xiao Chong slowly moved closer to [Zhou Yiqing], resting their foreheads together.
0:42:1|0:42:8|For a moment, the little bug suddenly frowned, then turned away from [Zhou Yiqing] and took a deep breath.
0:42:23|0:42:36|[Zhou Yiqing] watched as the little bug writhed in pain, tears sliding down from the corner of her eyes.
0:42:41|0:42:43|[Zhou Yiqing] reached out her hand and gently touched the insect's cheek.
0:42:50|0:43:6|Embracing the little bug with affection, their foreheads pressed closely together.
0:43:6|0:43:13|Late at night, Zhou Yiqing is running alone outside, using the mechanical swinging of arms and pulsing of veins as an outlet for emotions.
0:43:20|0:43:34|She ran for who knows how long, then fell to her knees on the ground, covering her chest and crying out in pain.
0:43:34|0:43:40|The darkness seemed to swallow all the sadness, helplessness, and farewells.
0:43:40|0:43:45|The cicadas are still chirping, the lights are still on, the city at night is as calm as a dream.
0:43:51|0:43:59|The next morning, [Zhou Yiqing] waited for the train at the station with a backpack on her back.
0:43:59|0:44:9|In the campus, [Xiao Chong] limped into the office and found that [Zhou Yiqing]'s desk was already empty.
0:44:26|0:44:27|Coach Pan is chewing gum.
0:44:53|0:45:2|[Little Worm] rushed out, at this moment, [Fang Chongyu]'s train arrived.
0:45:2|0:45:5|[Little Bug] ran desperately towards the train station.
0:45:11|0:45:23|[Mi Qing] sat on the train, holding the shoebox with her little brother's crooked handwriting on it, saying "I want to become the world's number one."
0:45:27|0:45:35|[Little Bug] finally arrived at the train station, but the train had already started moving. She stumbled and chased after it, but could only watch as the train went further away.
0:45:41|0:45:47|[Little Bug] returned home in a daze, only to find his father's taxi parked outside, which he had been driving for a lifetime.
0:45:47|0:45:47|In the room, the sick father is lying down receiving an IV drip.
0:46:15|0:46:20|Dad struggled to sit up.
0:46:23|0:46:24|[Zhou Yiqing] angrily turned and walked away.
0:46:39|0:46:45|[Zhou Yiqing] walked to the door, her father was still waiting inside.
0:46:45|0:46:59|[Zhou Yiqing] walked up to the taxi, looking at the old vehicle. He stood by the rolled-down window for a long time, finally deciding to follow in his father's footsteps and drive a taxi to make a living.
0:47:4|0:47:14|In the countless days and nights that followed, [Zhou Yiqing] lived a mundane life as a taxi driver.
0:47:27|0:47:39|[Chongyu Fang], who left without saying goodbye, was weighed down by the heavy realities of her brother who failed to win the championship because of himself, her father's illness, and the injury to her left leg, making it hard for her to breathe.
0:47:39|0:47:47|Long-distance running seems to have become the distant and unattainable dream hidden in her heart.
0:47:47|0:47:52|One day, [Zhou Yiqing] went out to pick up passengers as usual, when suddenly the passenger in the back seat spoke.
0:47:54|0:48:22|[Zhou Yiqing] immediately hit the brakes, causing the passenger to bump into the front seat. The passenger impatiently paid and got off the car. [Zhou Yiqing] picked up the magazine left by the passenger, which was the 1994 issue of "Runner's World". The cover featured a preview of the 7-day ultra marathon in the American Canyon. As another passenger boarded the car, [Zhou Yiqing] put away the magazine. Sorry for the inconvenience, thank you.
0:48:25|0:48:35|The passenger in the back seat was the then unknown [Jay Chou].
0:48:35|0:48:38|The car accelerated, and the cassette tape slipped out of [Jay Chou]'s hand.
0:48:57|0:49:5|The little bug excitedly showed the magazine cover to [Zhou Yiqing].
0:49:5|0:49:15|The little bug picked up the cassette tape and inserted it directly into the slot in the car to start playing.
0:49:15|0:49:18|Music started playing in the car.
0:49:18|0:49:20|The little bug continued to drive with a smile.
0:49:20|0:49:23|Before long, he turned up the volume of the music again.
0:49:25|0:49:32|[Zhou Yiqing] also began to carefully read the notice of the desert marathon event.
0:49:32|0:49:44|That day, the sun was just right, and memories of the past flooded my mind, filled with the obsession of the long-distance running dream, as well as my brother and coach Yi Qin from childhood.
0:49:54|0:50:3|[Zhou Yiqing] felt a bit embarrassed as the little bug took the tape and handed it to him.
0:50:20|0:50:24|Jay Chou handed the magazine to [A Xuan].
0:50:29|0:50:32|Jay Chou only had some loose change in his pocket.
0:51:2|0:51:6|Jay Chou ran into the TV station.
0:51:6|0:51:10|[Xiao Chong] rekindled the dream of running the desert marathon.
0:51:10|0:51:16|In his spare time driving a taxi, [Fang Chongyu] went to the hospital to take some shots and endured painful rehabilitation training.
0:51:29|0:51:31|To swim for physical fitness and lung capacity training.
0:51:38|0:51:46|He often recalls the words she used to say to him, poking his forehead with her finger.
0:52:12|0:52:27|One day, [Fang Chongyu] was reading a magazine in the car when suddenly, [A Xuan] rushed up and held a knife to his neck, threatening him.
0:52:27|0:52:33|[A Xuan] surprisedly takes off his sunglasses.
0:52:33|0:52:36|The police car drove by, and [A Xuan] suddenly lowered his head.
0:52:43|0:52:50|Suddenly, a heavy rain started pouring down.
0:52:50|0:52:58|[A Xuan] got off the car and started running desperately forward, with Xiaochong following and chasing after [A Xuan] from behind.
0:52:58|0:53:8|A Xuan is tackled by a small bug, and the two wrestle in a mud pit.
0:53:8|0:53:11|The little bug swung his fist, missed, and was counterattacked by [A Xuan].
0:53:13|0:53:18|[A Xuan] is holding a stack of money to give to Little Worm.
0:53:18|0:53:28|The bug threw the money away, pushed [A Xuan], and stood up.
0:53:28|0:53:37|[A Xuan] wiped the mud off his face.
0:53:37|0:53:41|[A Xuan] pushed the little bug into the mud, and the two started fighting again.
0:53:54|0:54:0|Xiao Chong punched [A Xuan], and both of them fell into the mud pit.
0:54:11|0:54:13|The little bug landed heavily in the mud.
0:54:27|0:54:40|[A Xuan] reached out a hand to the little bug, which clenched its teeth and yelled out loud, then grabbed [A Xuan]'s hand and stood up with the help.
0:54:40|0:54:54|[A Xuan] held the small insect in his arms as the torrential rain poured down, drowning out the tears and screams, seemingly also diluting some misunderstandings and hatred.
0:54:54|0:54:59|After the rain, the little bug worked together with [A Xuan].
0:55:10|0:55:18|[A Xuan] snatched the medicine box from Dr. Jia's hands, and his accomplice immediately rushed out to grab it. [A Xuan] threw the medicine box to Xiao Chong.
0:55:18|0:55:22|The little bug catches the medicine box, and the two of them quickly escape after succeeding.
0:55:22|0:55:30|Seeing the other person about to catch up with the little bug, he threw the backpack to [A Xuan].
0:55:30|0:55:35|[A Xuan] is carrying a backpack, with Dr. Jia chasing after him relentlessly.
0:55:35|0:55:38|[A Xuan] jumped onto a rooftop, while Dr. Jia shouted loudly.
0:55:41|0:55:46|[A Xuan] stood at a high place and threw the backpack to Xiao Chong.
0:55:46|0:55:49|The little bug jumped up, caught the backpack, and ran.
0:55:49|0:55:56|The fake doctor took out a knife and stabbed at [A Xuan], who struggled with the other person.
0:55:56|0:56:1|He picked up the flowerpot from the ground and threw it at them, gradually losing strength, and got his face cut by a knife.
0:56:3|0:56:31|Fang Chongyu left A Xuan behind and went to find the bug with a backpack, they surrounded it. The bug had to grab the beam and jump to avoid them, seeing the backpack about to be taken away, the bug kicked the opponent with its hind leg and threw the backpack to A Xuan below. A Xuan knocked down the two opponents with the backpack, climbed to a higher place, pushed down the ladder, and won a moment to catch their breath.
0:56:38|0:56:43|On the other side, Xiaochong made a call to the police.
0:56:43|0:56:49|Sergeant [A Xuan] is outnumbered and surrounded by the enemy, with no strength left to fight back.
0:56:49|0:56:57|At this moment, the alarm bell rang loudly, and the other party immediately fled.
0:56:57|0:57:0|[A Xuan] leaned against the wall with a smile, lighting a cigarette for himself.
0:57:7|0:57:12|The little bug parked the car not far from [A Xuan], and two people got in.
0:57:12|0:57:17|One of the passengers turns out to be [Zhou Yiqing].
0:57:17|0:57:27|The little bug looked at [Zhou Yiqing] in the aftermath, then glanced at [A Xuan] being interrogated in the corner, gritted its teeth and started the car.
0:57:30|0:57:38|Yiqing recognized Xiaochong and kept looking ahead on the road, the man beside her asked in confusion.
0:57:38|0:57:43|Zhou Yiqing ran her fingers through her hair, pretending as if nothing had happened.
0:57:43|0:57:55|The man exclaimed as he saw the magazine.
0:57:55|0:57:57|The car stopped, Yiqing said to the man.
0:57:59|0:58:13|Zhou Yiqing handed the money to Xiao Chong, who didn't take the money directly, but gently held Zhou Yiqing's hand.
0:58:13|0:58:20|Zhou Yiqing looked at her affectionately.
0:58:20|0:58:26|For a moment, [Fang Chongyu] calmed down, released his hand and took the money.
0:58:31|0:58:37|[Zhou Yiqing] placed the magazine on the passenger seat.
0:58:37|0:58:45|The man walked to the car door and kindly closed it for her.
0:58:45|0:58:49|After walking a few steps, [Zhou Yiqing] turned back and took another look.
0:58:55|0:59:17|The little bug looked at the backs of the two people, sadly pushed the money aside, picked up the magazine, and wanted to tear it page by page.
0:59:17|0:59:23|Suddenly, he noticed a page in the ultra-marathon book with a drawing of a broken bridge and the words "2 p.m." underneath.
0:59:31|0:59:35|In the afternoon, Fang Chongyu ran to the broken bridge, leaning against the railing and panting heavily.
0:59:43|0:59:57|Wearing a skirt instead of her usual sportswear, [Zhou Yiqing] walks over from the other side of the bridge.
1:0:36|1:0:42|[Zhou Yiqing] took out a paper bag from her bag.
1:1:2|1:1:5|The little bug angrily questioned again.
1:1:21|1:1:23|The bug tore open the paper bag and threw it on the ground.
1:1:49|1:1:51|Even if there was a real danger to his life, he still went for a run.
1:1:56|1:1:59|[Fang Chongyu] stood up and stared at the small bug.
1:2:17|1:2:27|After speaking, [A Xuan] turned his shoulder and quickly walked away, leaving Little Bug stunned. He decided to participate in the ultra marathon.
1:2:27|1:2:34|In the desert, [Fang Chongyu] put on his sunglasses, looked at the endless sand dunes in front of him, and stood firmly at the starting line.
1:2:43|1:2:50|The starting gun goes off, and the contestants cheer as they run towards the finish line.
1:2:50|1:2:58|Under the scorching sun, [Fang Chongyu] runs alone across the vast desert.
1:2:58|1:3:7|Midway, he traveled with the foreigner Charlie, and the two heard the roar of an airplane above their heads, stopping in their tracks to look up.
1:3:7|1:3:10|Charlie raised both arms, excitedly waving towards the sky.
1:3:14|1:3:20|Charlie patted [Fang Chongyu]'s chest, and [Fang Chongyu] followed.
1:3:20|1:3:23|Charlie's wife and daughter have arrived.
1:3:23|1:3:28|They ran towards Charlie as soon as they got off the plane, embracing each other happily.
1:3:28|1:3:37|[Fang Chongyu] quietly walked to the side and took off his equipment.
1:3:37|1:3:37|Fang Chongyu didn't hear it.
1:3:40|1:3:44|The little bug stopped in its tracks and looked back at [Zhou Yiqing].
1:3:44|1:3:56|He rushed over and tightly embraced her.
1:3:56|1:3:58|Fang Chongyu and Zhou Yiqing walked side by side by the salt lake.
1:4:6|1:4:8|[Zhou Yiqing] suddenly found herself facing the small bug walking backwards.
1:4:29|1:4:31|Turning around, [Fang Chongyu] walked in front of the little bug.
1:4:51|1:4:58|The little bug grabbed [Zhou Yiqing]'s hand, gazing at her, and said earnestly.
1:5:17|1:5:23|Li Qing smiled as she took off her backpack and tied up her hair.
1:5:23|1:5:28|The two stood on the same starting line, just like in the competition on the school sports field years ago.
1:5:34|1:5:40|[Zhou Yiqing] stopped after running a few steps, clutching her chest and gasping for breath.
1:5:40|1:5:53|The little bug ran far away, realizing that [Zhou Yiqing] hadn't caught up. He stopped in his tracks and turned around to shout.
1:5:53|1:5:57|Zhou Yiqing smiled as she looked at him.
1:5:57|1:6:0|At the farewell, the bottle was covered with reluctant friends and family.
1:6:2|1:6:16|The little bug reached out his hand to shield the sunlight from her, smoothed her hair behind her ears, and took off his own hat to put on her head.
1:6:16|1:6:27|Caressing the head of the little bug with affection, [Fang Chongyu] brought her close, leaned in, and solemnly kissed her forehead.
1:6:31|1:6:40|After speaking, he mischievously put the hat back on Little Bug's head, the brim covering half of his face.
1:6:40|1:6:46|Someone is urging the little bug.
1:6:56|1:7:1|Previously, Fang Chongyu watched the little bug leave, took a few steps, then stopped.
1:7:7|1:7:24|He put down his backpack, tied up his hair, and ran towards the direction where the little bug had left with all his strength.
1:7:24|1:7:30|He opened his arms wide until he couldn't breathe, covered his chest, and stopped with a smile.
1:7:41|1:7:49|In the church, [Zhou Yiqing] walks towards the groom in a wedding dress, they smile as they watch each other slowly approaching.
1:7:49|1:8:1|Just as they were about to kiss, the insects inside the tent suddenly woke up, revealing that the wedding was just a dream of the insects.
1:8:1|1:8:8|The little bug woke up, breathing heavily, looked up at the night sky, the moon was high, very round, very bright.
1:8:11|1:8:14|The marathon that Fang Chongyu participated in was reported by the TV station.
1:8:14|1:8:21|At the 273-kilometer Grand Canyon Ultra Marathon held in Utah, USA, 150 top runners from various countries gathered at the starting line.
1:8:21|1:8:24|Before the game started, [Fang Chongyu] almost withdrew from the game due to a foot injury.
1:8:29|1:8:31|The two of them are constantly pulling back and forth in the competition.
1:8:35|1:8:42|Dad with an IV drip was both shocked and delighted to see this report, while Xiao Ke was holding his daughter and cheering for Xiao Chong in front of the TV.
1:8:42|1:8:56|In the desert, not a moment of relaxation for the small insects. A female contestant behind the team surpassed Xiao Chong and Charlie, and the two worked hard to overtake the female contestant again. The tug-of-war is still between Xiao Chong and Charlie.
1:8:56|1:9:5|Approaching the finish line, both Fang Chongyu and Zhou Yiqing were feeling a bit exhausted. A Xuan looked at Charlie, whose condition was deteriorating, gritted his teeth, and continued to exert himself.
1:9:12|1:9:17|The little bug stopped in its tracks when it saw Charlie fall to the ground.
1:9:17|1:9:24|The female contestant following closely behind the two of them waved her arms, crossed the finish line first, and the crowd cheered.
1:9:29|1:9:33|Xiao Chong helped [Zhou Yiqing] up and ran forward together.
1:9:33|1:9:34|Xiao Chongyu said to him.
1:9:40|1:9:46|Xiao Chong and [Zhou Yiqing] crossed the finish line with smiles on their faces, embracing tightly.
1:9:46|1:9:51|In the alley, [A Xuan] caught a thief, while the TV in the grocery store was broadcasting the news.
1:9:58|1:10:23|The thief sneaked into the grocery store, [A Xuan] propped up the half-closed anti-theft door of the grocery store and wrestled with the thief. The grocery store owner's wife persuaded [A Xuan] and then punched the thief who was lying on the ground. At this moment, Wang Dalu's interview was playing on the TV.
1:10:52|1:10:55|[A Xuan] saw the news about the little bug on TV.
1:11:17|1:11:19|[A Xuan] focused on watching the news report.
1:11:19|1:11:23|The thief took the opportunity to crawl away from the ground, and [A Xuan] turned around and caught him back.
1:11:43|1:11:47|A Xuan grabbed her hair in pain, squatted on the ground, and cried loudly.
1:11:47|1:11:52|On the TV screen, there is a scene of Xiaochong and Charlie joyfully embracing as they cross the finish line.
1:12:9|1:12:19|The boss sent the boss lady to make tea, she walked over and squatted beside [A Xuan], patting his shoulder to comfort him.
1:12:19|1:12:22|She knew that [A Xuan] was hating herself for not sticking to her dreams.
1:12:25|1:12:53|The coverage of the marathon continues, and Little Bug's dad sees his son waving his arms on TV and bursts into tears of joy. The final score is out, and Little Bug is the world champion.
1:12:56|1:13:9|Dad raised his thumb to celebrate for his son across the screen, while the TV was still playing the record of Little Worm's journey.
1:13:9|1:13:17|Dad trembled as he secretly removed the medical tape and pulled out the intravenous needle, then ran out of the house, exerting all his strength to run on the road.
1:13:18|1:13:29|The elderly man, whose frail body no longer allowed him to run for long, still exerted all his strength to swing his arms, as if he had found his youthful self in that moment.
1:13:29|1:13:38|Dad gasped heavily, jumped up before losing the last bit of strength, fell flat on the ground, and raised his arms shouting loudly.
1:13:47|1:13:51|After the match, Fang Chongyu rushed back home for the first time.
1:13:51|1:13:53|He ran towards the church at the fastest speed.
1:13:53|1:14:3|In the church, the priest is reading the marriage vows.
1:14:6|1:14:10|When he stood still, he realized that the bride was not the one he loved.
1:14:10|1:14:14|Apologizing amidst the puzzled looks of the guests, [Zhou Yiqing] prepared to turn and leave.
1:14:19|1:14:25|The orphanage director sitting in the front row called out to Little Bug, ran over and said a few words to him, and Little Bug nodded.
1:14:30|1:14:34|[Zhou Yiqing] is lying on the hospital bed.
1:14:34|1:14:40|The little bug sat by the bed, holding [Zhou Yiqing]'s hand, gazing at her.
1:14:52|1:14:57|[Zhou Yiqing] hesitated timidly, her voice faltering as she leaned in to listen to the small bug.
1:15:15|1:15:22|Closing his eyes in pain before, when he opened them, they were filled with tears.
1:15:34|1:15:43|[Zhou Yiqing] pulled the little bug closer, struggling to lift her head and press her forehead against the bug's.
1:15:43|1:15:59|After speaking, [Zhou Yiqing] closed her eyes, relaxed her head and hands at the same time, and fell back on the sickbed.
1:15:59|1:16:1|In the small clinic room, [A Xuan] kneels in front of the eccentric doctor.
1:16:3|1:16:7|A Xuan did not agree, and the eccentric doctor shook his head, ordering the bodyguard.
1:16:30|1:16:52|[A Xuan] and the bodyguard wrestled, [A Xuan] took the knife from the bodyguard's hand, rushed forward and held the knife against the neck of the strange doctor, roaring loudly.
1:16:52|1:16:56|Touching on A Xuan's sore spot, he retracted the knife and knelt back down on the ground.
1:17:24|1:17:32|In the hospital, Xiao Chong touched the bed he used to lie on before. Now, it was empty and devoid of any warmth.
1:17:41|1:17:50|[Zhou Yiqing]'s fiancé walked in and handed her a shoebox.
1:18:0|1:18:14|When they were running into a dead end together, A Xuan looked sadly at the red sneakers that had once been worn by him.
1:18:26|1:18:32|The little bug tightly gripped the red shoelaces on the pair of shoes, lowered its head, and burst into tears.
1:18:41|1:18:50|In a dilapidated bathroom, a sinister atmosphere pervades, with the dim yellow light on the ceiling swaying precariously.
1:18:50|1:19:2|[A Xuan] wakes up from unconsciousness, only to find himself lying in a bathtub filled with blood, shirtless.
1:19:2|1:19:6|He knelt up in pain, with a long scar on his waist.
1:19:11|1:19:21|He realized that the quack doctor had already taken his kidney while he was unconscious.
1:19:21|1:19:24|[A Xuan] roared and collapsed weakly.
1:19:24|1:19:38|Thinking of his son and daughter, [Fang Chongyu] gritted his teeth, grabbed the side of the bathtub in pain, exerted all his strength to flip himself out of the bathtub, picked up the clothes draped over the washbasin, pushed open the door, and ran out.
1:19:38|1:19:40|At home, Fang Chongyu is coaxing his daughter to sleep.
1:19:51|1:19:56|[A Xuan] covered the wound, staggered and ran wildly all the way, and finally reached the door of the house and slammed it hard.
1:20:6|1:20:10|No one opened the door for him, so [A Xuan] had to climb in through the window.
1:20:10|1:20:15|He ran to the crib and found his daughter was not inside, thinking that something bad had happened to her.
1:20:15|1:20:27|He grabbed his daughters' clothes and held them tightly, crying loudly. 
1:20:27|1:20:32|At this moment, Xiao Ke pushed the door open and [A Xuan] hugged him tightly.
1:20:32|1:20:35|Xiao Ke was shocked to find blood on [A Xuan]'s body.
1:20:51|1:20:57|It's late at night, Xiao Chong is sitting in the taxi drinking beer.
1:20:57|1:21:5|A Xuan walked over, placed her hand on the car, and bent down to look at the small insect.
1:21:15|1:21:33|[A Xuan] stared at the small bug, which answered with a tone of sadness.
1:21:38|1:21:50|A Xuan climbed onto the hood of the car with an iron rod in hand.
1:21:50|1:21:53|A Xuan forcefully smashes the windshield.
1:22:5|1:22:11|A Xuan kicked the shattered windshield one last time before jumping out of the car and walking away.
1:22:11|1:22:21|She didn't want to see the little bug become like her, losing dreams and living a life of compromise.
1:22:21|1:22:28|During the day, [Fang Chongyu] arrived at the orphanage and saw the director teaching the children how to paint.
1:22:44|1:22:46|[Xiaomi] hugged [Xiaochong].
1:22:50|1:22:58|[Little Bug] looked out and seemed to see the silhouette that used to run in the desert and the silhouette under the setting sun.
1:22:58|1:23:6|One day, [Fang Chongyu] and [A Xuan] sat on the high steps like they did when they were young. [A Xuan] put his arm around [Fang Chongyu] and patted his head.
1:23:14|1:23:19|[Little Worm] removed [A Xuan]'s hand, smiled and replied, and [A Xuan] also smiled and playfully hit him with her hand.
1:23:19|1:23:22|In the desert, [Fang Chongyu] encountered a wounded wolf, which was lying on the ground in pain.
1:23:44|1:23:52|[Fang Chongyu] slowly walked over, determined that there was no danger, and then took out the gauze from the bag to bandage the wolf.
1:23:52|1:24:0|The wolf bit [Little Bug]'s arm in pain.
1:24:0|1:24:3|The wolf seemed to understand what [the little bug] said and relaxed its grip.
1:24:3|1:24:12|After bandaging itself, it licked its wound and remembered the appearance of [the little bug].
1:24:12|1:24:13|The little bug continued to run.
1:24:22|1:24:26|In the hospital, Coach Pan met the family of [A Xuan].
1:24:52|1:24:59|[A Xuan] immediately put away his smile and looked nervously at Coach Pan.
1:24:59|1:25:10|In the desert, a small insect on the airport road takes the opportunity while the camp owner goes inside to grab something, and stuffs the food outside into its mouth.
1:25:14|1:25:20|The little bug hastily grabbed the food and ran away, while the owner shot at him with a gun, causing the bug to fall to the ground.
1:25:23|1:25:37|In the hospital, [Zhou Yiqing] lay on the hospital bed, watching the TV report and shedding tears.
1:25:37|1:25:48|Fang Chongyu, dressed in a white coat, hurriedly walked in and turned off the TV, sitting on the edge of the bed.
1:25:55|1:26:2|Coach Pan brought [A Xuan] to visit, and Coach Pan said to her former fiancé.
1:26:2|1:26:16|Fang Chongyu's ex-fiancé followed [A Xuan] to the outside of the ward, where [A Xuan] grabbed his collar and questioned him aggressively.
1:26:16|1:26:20|Fang Chongyu's ex-fiancé showed his identification to [A Xuan].
1:27:6|1:27:20|Coach Pan and [A Xuan] secretly pushed the empty hospital bed away while the medical staff were not paying attention.
1:27:22|1:27:25|[A Xuan] knocks him down to the ground.
1:27:30|1:27:40|A doctor came over and [A Xuan] forced the doctor to reveal the location of the heart, then drove with the engine to find the eccentric doctor.
1:27:40|1:27:50|In the consultation room, the female assistant handed a grape to the eccentric doctor, but he waved it away and didn't eat it.
1:27:50|1:27:57|Drinking water, suddenly [A Xuan] kicked open the door, pushed the bodyguard aside, threw the money to the side, and said to the strange doctor,
1:28:3|1:28:9|A Xuan pushed Yiqing in, she wanted to use the money to have the strange doctor help Yiqing change her heart.
1:28:9|1:28:15|The eccentric doctor changed into surgical scrubs, connected the equipment, and prepared to start the surgery.
1:28:35|1:28:44|A Xuan is equipped and ready to confront the police's armed search, buying time for the previous surgery.
1:28:44|1:28:53|Staring at the dark end of the corridor, the light from the police flashlight was getting closer. He pushed the abandoned hospital bed with all his strength towards the opposite side, hoping to delay the police as long as possible.
1:28:55|1:29:1|In the desert, the wounded Fang Chongyu, tied up and facing a gun, grits his teeth and stands up, using his feet to fight back.
1:29:1|1:29:5|[Ma Dongmei] was tied up, only able to fight with her feet and arms.
1:29:5|1:29:12|Due to the heavy blows and long-distance running, the little bug, whose energy was already running out, was quickly knocked down by the two strong men on the other side.
1:29:12|1:29:15|Outside the healing chamber, [A Xuan] is alone fighting against the police.
1:29:15|1:29:29|In the dim and narrow corridor, [A Xuan] picked up a stick, knocked down the person in front of him, then grabbed the door frame with both hands and jumped up. Taking advantage of the height, the wolf that saved the small insect in the back desert suddenly rushed over and bit off the rope tied to the small insect's hands. It roared angrily at the opponent next to the small insect and fought side by side with the small insect.
1:29:55|1:30:1|The person with the gun fired several shots at the wolf.
1:30:1|1:30:8|Fang Chongyu rushes over to knock the gun out of the other person's hand and engages in hand-to-hand combat after temporarily subduing the other person.
1:30:8|1:30:16|With the help of the wolf, the opponent was driven away.
1:30:16|1:30:22|In the consultation room, [A Xuan] pushed hard against the door, but the police force was too strong. They broke in with guns and subdued [A Xuan].
1:30:27|1:30:36|Beside the desert camp, the little bug talks to the wolf.
1:30:42|1:30:48|The wolf ran far away, and the little bug watched as the wolf howled at the sky on a distant sand dune.
1:30:58|1:31:15|In the consultation room, the eccentric doctor was also handcuffed, and the patient undergoing surgery stopped breathing.
1:31:15|1:31:18|After running through the desert, they arrived at the boundless grassland.
1:31:41|1:31:43|The orphanage has been receiving more and more donations.
1:31:45|1:31:58|The little bug ran to the Tibetan area, next to the prayer flags of five colors, with the image of Fang Chongyu's affectionate smile flashing in its mind.
1:31:58|1:32:2|Princess Wencheng, who went to Tibet for marriage, stood tall in a statue beside.
1:32:9|1:32:19|At night, as he crawled over the hill with his hands and feet, what gave him strength in his weakest moment was also the gentle smile of [Zhou Yiqing].
1:32:19|1:32:22|He seems to be watching the little bug from a high place, waiting for it to catch up.
1:32:27|1:32:28|Xiaomi looked into the distance and said.
1:32:57|1:33:2|The eagle soars in the sky, while the insects run on the vast land of blooming rapeseed flowers.
1:33:6|1:33:19|Not running to win anyone, as he ran, the little bug seemed to see the figure that used to stroll in the rapeseed field.
1:33:23|1:33:29|The scenery of Yanhu Lake is picturesque, but everything has changed.
1:33:29|1:33:36|The little bug ran and saw the silhouette of the dragonfly by the rock lake, quietly watching the lake.
1:33:36|1:33:43|The little bug stopped in its tracks, paused for a moment, then rushed into the water, but the dragonfly standing there had disappeared.
1:33:45|1:33:56|The little bug was forced to face reality, staring at the empty air, squatting down in pain, lowering its head, and gasping heavily. 
1:33:56|1:34:2|On the clear water surface, it seemed to see the reflection of [Zhou Yiqing] again.
1:34:2|1:34:8|It slowly stood up and found [Zhou Yiqing] standing not far away, staring at it.
1:34:11|1:34:25|[Zhou Yiqing] smiled gently, walked towards him step by step, reached out to touch his cheek, and planted a kiss on his forehead.
1:34:25|1:34:28|Their foreheads were pressed together, just like in the old days.
1:34:35|1:34:44|Perhaps for the little bug, running really can take him through time and see the smile of his loved one again.
1:34:44|1:34:54|In the memory, [Zhou Yiqing] joyfully runs in the desert, smiling and waving at him to hurry up and catch up.
1:34:54|1:35:1|When Xiaochong fell, [Zhou Yiqing] was always just a step away, bending down to reach out a hand to him.
1:35:12|1:35:22|Under the setting sun, a small insect once again climbs up the sand dune, the road stretching endlessly ahead, leading towards the direction of dreams.
1:35:22|1:35:30|Night falls, and someone has turned into a star guarding its journey, vast starry sky, love and dreams, wishing it eternal.
