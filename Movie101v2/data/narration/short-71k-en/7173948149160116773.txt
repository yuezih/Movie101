0:0:38|0:0:44|In the setting sun, [Huyan Dazang] is wielding a sword, cutting down the wooden figures surrounding him in a circle with swift and agile movements.
0:0:44|0:0:48|In an instant, the wooden man was hacked to pieces by his sword.
0:0:48|0:0:51|At this moment, the screen shows the title of the movie "Love Sword".
0:0:51|0:0:57|In the inn, [Huyan Dazang] and [Bai Sankong] sat facing each other, with [Huyan Dazang] crossing his arms in front of his chest and [Bai Sankong] staring at him intently.
0:0:58|0:1:6|During the fight, [Huyan Dazang] reached out his hand to attack [Bai Sankong]. [Bai Sankong] raised his arm to block [Huyan Dazang]'s arm, and the two of them wrestled together.
0:1:6|0:1:11|Following that, [Huyan Dazang] reached out with his other hand to continue attacking [Bai Sankong], but was pressed down on the table.
0:1:14|0:1:23|Shortly after, [Huyan Dazang] lifted his foot and kicked [Bai Sankong], then pulled out his arms. [Bai Sankong] defended against [Huyan Dazang]'s attacks, and after exchanging punches in the air, both fell to the ground on their backs.
0:1:23|0:1:32|Suddenly, [Bai Sankong] kicked the table away, and the two fought under the flying table. As the table fell, their fists were only a foot apart.
0:1:42|0:1:46|[Huyan Dazang] instantly kicked over the table, then he pierced through the table and drew out his sword.
0:2:2|0:2:9|Next, the two drew their swords and faced each other, swinging their swords in the inn, creating a rapid flurry of sword shadows in the air.
0:2:9|0:2:15|Shortly after, the two of them moved from the inn to the outside, and the inn's guests also fled outside.
0:2:15|0:2:19|Just as [Bai Sankong] launched an attack, [Huyan Dazang] struck him down from a high place with a single sword.
0:2:20|0:2:25|[Bai Sankong] fell heavily to the ground, with [Huyan Dazang] following closely behind and stepping on [Bai Sankong]'s sword.
0:2:25|0:2:34|Afterwards, [Huyan Dazang] slowly sheathed his sword, his unruly long hair swaying in the wind as he stood there, exuding a heroic aura.
0:2:34|0:2:37|At the funeral of [Bai Sankong], everyone is dressed in mourning clothes and kneeling in homage.
0:2:47|0:3:11|On the outskirts of the inn, [Huyan Dazang] and [Mulang Shenjun] are wielding their swords, causing the onlookers to flee in panic. As they soar through the air and land, [Huyan Dazang] uses his blade to clamp down on [Mulang Shenjun]'s sword, then twists and breaks it. With a forceful strike forward, [Huyan Dazang] pushes [Mulang Shenjun] backwards.
0:3:11|0:3:16|Speak, [Huyan Dazang] picked up the knife and handed it to [Mulang Shenjun]. [Mulang Shenjun] took the knife, and [Huyan Dazang] turned and left.
0:3:42|0:3:45|Later, the two of them arrived at a tavern.
0:3:53|0:4:5|At this moment, a firework rose outside the house, and [Mulang Shenjun] glanced warily towards the outside.
0:4:5|0:4:14|[Huyan Dazang] sent [Mulang Shenjun] away and was stopped by a young boy.
0:4:20|0:4:25|[Huyan Dazang] squatted down, smiling as he touched the little boy's face, only to be stabbed by the boy with a knife.
0:4:25|0:4:31|Shortly after, [Huyan Dazang] looked down at the dagger stuck in his chest, then looked up at the fleeing young boy.
0:4:31|0:4:38|The people around gathered, [Huyan Dazang] slowly fell down, holding the dagger in his hand, his body trembling uncontrollably.
0:4:38|0:4:43|On the other side, Mulang Shenjun is walking towards the Qianhu Army Camp.
0:4:43|0:4:45|Mulang Shenjun raised his shield, and the soldiers cleared a path.
0:4:48|0:4:54|At night, [Huyan Dazang] staggered into an abandoned house.
0:4:54|0:4:57|[Huyan Dazang] looked up at [Zhu'er] in front of him, then fell down beside the fence.
0:5:9|0:5:22|On this clear morning, [Huyan Dazang] slowly opened his eyes. The dilapidated walls let in the glaring morning light. Startled, [Huyan Dazang] sat up and looked around at the unfamiliar surroundings, his gaze fixed on his bandaged chest. Then, [Duchess Tuo Chen] walked over.
0:5:41|0:5:47|[Huyan Dazang] smiled and nodded, then [Zhu'er] stood up and walked to the side.
0:6:7|0:6:8|[Huyan Dazang] stood up and looked at [Zhu'er].
0:6:26|0:6:31|Just as [Huyan Dazang] was handing the sword to Zhu Wa, [Li Xiaoran] led a group of people rushing over.
0:7:5|0:7:11|[ Huyan Dazang ] raised his hand and the blade fell, causing [ Li Xiaoran ] to fall down.
0:7:21|0:7:24|Shortly after, [Huyan Dazang] walked towards the outside of the house.
0:7:52|0:7:58|Inside the house, [Fang Baoyu] kneels in front of [Purple Marquis], while outside the outskirts, [Huyan Dazang] and Yuzhong are crouching under a tree.
0:8:25|0:8:28|[Huyan Dazang] is playing with a twig in his hand.
0:8:53|0:9:1|Speak, [Huyan Dazang] then strides away.
0:10:6|0:10:12|At this moment, [Huyan Dazang] walked through the crowd carrying a sword from the other end, while the Purple Marquis stood on a high place staring at him.
0:10:12|0:10:19|[Huyan Dazang] arrived at the center of the Hailong Pier, with the crowd behind him surrounding the path he came from. He stood still and looked up.
0:10:23|0:10:31|The Purple Marquis stared at the sword of [Huyan Dazang], and then the two of them came to the deck, waving their blades in the air.
0:10:31|0:10:35|[Huyan Dazang] soared into the air, and the Purple Marquis frowned as he caught the sword thrust from [Huyan Dazang].
0:10:35|0:10:44|Then the two of them turned around and intertwined, stabbing at each other with one sword after another, with [Huyan Dazang] bending down and sliding towards the feet of Purple Marquis.
0:10:44|0:10:46|The Purple Marquis leaped backwards and then jumped up to stand on the deck.
0:10:48|0:10:56|At this moment, [Huyan Dazang] looked up and then split the dock in half with a leap, standing side by side with the Purple Marquis in battle.
0:10:56|0:10:59|The Purple Marquis, unwilling to be outdone, shot an arrow through Huyan Dazang's arrow.
0:10:59|0:11:5|[Huyan Dazang] turned around, and [Purple Marquis] flew up in the air with an arrow, the two of them deadlocked, causing [Zhu'er] in the distance to be extremely anxious.
0:11:5|0:11:11|At that moment, [Huyan Dazang] kicked Mulang Shenjun off the boat, and Mulang Shenjun swiftly flew towards Duchess Tuo Chen in the crowd.
0:11:11|0:11:14|Mulang Shenjun immediately stood in front of Duchess Tuo Chen and was not hit by Mulang Shenjun.
0:11:19|0:11:24|Later, the two of them gazed at each other, while in the distance, the [Purple Marquis] was still engaged in battle with [Huyan Dazang].
0:11:24|0:11:31|At this moment, [Huyan Dazang] squatted down instantly, spun and leaped into the air, then waved his arrows towards [Purple Marquis].
0:11:31|0:11:34|[Purple Marquis] fixed his gaze and stood still, dodging the arrow.
0:11:34|0:11:39|The people standing on the shore all widened their eyes, mouths agape in fear.
0:11:39|0:11:45|[Zhu'er] stood in the crowd, anxiously watching the two people on the boat, Mulang Shenjun and [Duchess Tuo Chen], also observing their every move on the boat.
0:11:45|0:11:50|Shortly after, the [Purple Marquis] spiraled in the air and flew towards [Huyan Dazang], who was repeatedly struck and forced to retreat.
0:11:51|0:12:9|In an instant, the sword of [Purple Marquis] aimed at the chest of [Huyan Dazang]. [Zhu'er] widened her eyes on the shore, [Huyan Dazang] lowered his head to look at his chest, and in a flash, [Purple Marquis] withdrew the sword. Then, [Huyan Dazang] raised his head, flew into the water, and at that moment, everyone disappeared to the shore, with [Zhu'er] rushing to the front and falling down on the shore.
0:13:7|0:13:12|On the river bank, [Huyan Dazang] hands the grilled fish to [Zhu'er].
0:13:12|0:13:13|[Zhu'er] turned her head to the side.
0:13:45|0:13:51|In the Taoist temple, [Purple Marquis] and the Taoist priest are practicing swordsmanship among the falling leaves, while on the other side, amidst the rapeseed flowers.
0:13:54|0:13:59|The final battle was inevitable, with [Zhu'er] and [Huyan Dazang] fighting side by side.
0:14:18|0:14:22|[Huyan Dazang] turned his head and looked into the distance, with [Zhu'er] staring at his back.
0:15:11|0:15:20|Zhu'er's eyes welled up with tears, while Huyan Dazang stood expressionless in place, his gaze becoming increasingly fierce.
0:15:20|0:15:26|[Huyan Dazang] drew his sword and held it in front of [Zhu'er]. [Zhu'er] was shedding tears and frowning, staring intently into [Huyan Dazang]'s eyes.
0:15:26|0:15:33|Shortly after, [Zhu'er] raised her hand and brought [Huyan Dazang]'s sword to her own neck. Suddenly, [Huyan Dazang] lifted his eyes and looked at [Zhu'er].
0:15:46|0:15:57|Words fell silent, tears welled up in [Zhu'er]'s eyes, [Huyan Dazang] looked anxiously at [Zhu'er]'s hand holding the sword.
0:15:57|0:16:0|Huyan Dazang's eyes dodged, and tears also washed her eyes clean.
0:16:4|0:16:9|Zhu Er looked sadly at [Huyan Dazang], a large tear rolling down from the corner of his eye.
0:16:9|0:16:16|At this moment, the vibrant rapeseed flowers around them were in full bloom, and the two people, surrounded by flowers, gazed into each other's eyes.
0:16:16|0:16:19|In an instant, Huyan Dazang suddenly exerted force, his eyes widened.
0:16:19|0:16:37|Zhu Er raised the sword in Huyan Dazang's hand, reaching towards his own neck. In an instant, Dazang grabbed the sword, frowning and staring tightly at the sword in his hand. Zhu Er lowered his head to look at Dazang's hand, and at that moment, Dazang's hand holding the sword slowly oozed blood. Dazang then released his grip on the sword, leaving a bloodstain on it.
0:16:37|0:16:40|Soon after, the two embraced tightly in a sea of flowers.
0:17:14|0:17:19|In the Taoist temple, the ground was covered with dry leaves, and the incense burner in the temple was still emitting smoke.
0:17:19|0:17:27|Huyan Dazang and Fang Baoyu stood face to face in the center of the Taoist temple. At that moment, the two drew their swords and Dazang raised his sword to attack the Taoist.
0:17:27|0:17:29|The Taoist priest bowed his head, bent his waist, and rotated as he retreated backwards.
0:17:30|0:17:33|Soon after, the Taoist priest launched an attack on [Huyan Dazang] with a straight posture.
0:17:33|0:17:39|As Huyan Dazang advanced to attack, Daoist Fang Baoyu leaped into the air and intercepted Dazang's attack with a side somersault.
0:17:39|0:17:42|Huyan Dazang turned around and struggled to take on this sword from Daoist Zhang.
0:17:42|0:17:48|Huyan Dazang then raised both hands and placed the sword behind his back, perfectly catching the sword that the Taoist had thrust towards him.
0:17:49|0:18:4|Huyan Dazang then used his strength to strike Dao Chang's chest with a palm. Dao Chang was forced to step back continuously. Dazang dropped his sword and stood still, while Dao Chang, holding a sword in one hand, had a trace of blood flowing from the corner of his mouth. In an instant, Dazang suddenly squatted down and spun like a top.
0:18:5|0:18:10|He waved his arrow and soared into the air. When the Taoist turned his head, Huyan Dazang had already flown in front of him.
0:18:10|0:18:18|Dao Chang lunged forward, with Huyan Dazang leaping behind him. Then an arrow pierced into Huyan Dazang's abdomen, followed by a gush of blood from his mouth.
0:18:18|0:18:26|It's late at night, [Fang Baoyu] and Huyan Dazang are sitting side by side in front of the small courtyard gate. [Fang Baoyu] is roasting meat in front of the fire, while Huyan Dazang is adding firewood to the fire on the side.
0:18:26|0:18:29|Later, Ben Yue handed the meat to Huyan Dazang.
0:18:40|0:18:48|Huyan Dazang stopped abruptly after taking the meat.
0:18:48|0:18:55|In an instant, a fire crossbow shot into a wooden stake beside the two, then a group of people holding fire crossbows rushed out from the distant woods.
0:19:8|0:19:14|Later, Duchess Tuo Chen and Mulang rescued Huyan Dazang and Ben Yue.
0:19:14|0:19:27|On the other side, [Purple Marquis] is packing up his belongings.
0:19:27|0:19:29|[Fang Baoyu] stood beside [Purple Marquis].
0:19:29|0:19:32|At this moment, Purple Marquis raised his hand to signal Fang Baoyu to sit down with him.
0:19:50|0:19:52|She dares to love and hate.
0:20:0|0:20:6|Many people didn't take her seriously.
0:20:6|0:20:7|Until one day.
0:20:20|0:20:24|Saying that, [Purple Marquis] stood up, and [Fang Baoyu] also stood up.
0:20:29|0:20:34|At this moment, Lord [Ben Yue] walked in.
0:20:36|0:20:38|[Zhu'er], [Huyan Dazang], and others were about to leave the cabin but were stopped.
0:20:54|0:21:13|[Huyan Dazang] kicked the sword, the sword flew out with its scabbard, stabbing towards the enemy. At the same time, [Huyan Dazang] and [Mulang Shenjun] rushed towards the enemy. [Huyan Dazang] waved his sword as the enemies approached one by one. On the other side, [Mulang Shenjun] stabbed the enemies with his sword and kicked them down one by one. As the enemies fell, [Zhu'er] sword hit, igniting a pack of gunpowder.
0:21:13|0:21:21|Later, [Huyan Dazang], [Ben Yue], [Duchess Tuo Chen], and [Mulang Shenjun] stood in a row, with [Ben Yue] throwing out gunpowder, causing the enemies to fall down one after another.
0:21:22|0:21:30|In the smoke, [Zhu'er] was caught by [Wang Dian].
0:21:30|0:21:33|At this moment, in the desolate wilderness, several people are riding horses galloping towards the distance.
0:21:33|0:21:37|[Wang Dian] is riding on horseback, standing still with two attendants behind him.
0:21:37|0:21:43|[Wang Dian] watched the departing troops from a distance, then took out a piece of paper from his sleeve.
0:22:2|0:22:6|The sky was cloudless for miles, with [Huyan Dazang] and [Mulang Shenjun] crouching in front of the Qingmu Palace.
0:22:19|0:22:23|Duchess Tuo Chen walked out with a smile, and the two turned to look at her.
0:22:50|0:22:53|They then turned and walked towards the Green Wood Hall.
0:22:53|0:22:57|On the river bank, [Fang Baoyu] is kneeling in front of the tomb of Huo Feiteng.
0:23:7|0:23:10|Facing the tombstone with a hunched back.
0:23:16|0:23:24|He furrowed his brows at first, then slowly reached into his clothes and pulled out a book full of creases, handing it over to [Fang Baoyu].
0:23:24|0:23:30|[Fang Baoyu] borrowed a book and immediately looked at the page, which read "Borrowing the Sun's Secret Palace".
0:23:45|0:23:53|On the other side, [Wang Dian] stood alertly outside a room, ready to knock on the door.
0:23:53|0:23:59|Shortly after, [Wang Dian] entered the room and closed the door behind him. He walked up to [Bai Sankong] with a smile.
0:24:40|0:24:47|After finishing speaking, [Huyan Dazang] first arrived at the tomb of Huo Tengfei, knelt down, and inserted his sword into the soil behind him.
0:25:23|0:25:28|Saying that, [Huyan Dazang] first lowered his head and sighed, then looked towards the tombstone.
0:25:55|0:26:6|At this moment, as he picked up a stone from the ground and walked towards the tomb, just as he raised the stone to smash the tombstone, a long silk ribbon flew from behind and wrapped around his hand. Then, [White Water Saintess] flew in and landed in front of him.
0:26:29|0:26:51|Said, [White Water Holy Mother] soared into the air, swinging her sleeves towards the drunken immortal on the ground. The drunken immortal dodged, but the sleeves heavily hit the ground. [White Water Holy Mother] took the opportunity to entangle the drunken immortal with another sleeve, lifting him up into the air before slamming him down heavily. [White Water Holy Mother] then descended from the air.
0:26:51|0:26:56|At that moment, [Fang Baoyu] suddenly sprang out from the ground, she lay on the ground and rubbed her eyes with her sleeve.
0:27:0|0:27:15|Shortly after, [Fang Baoyu] staggered to her feet. She squinted at the sun overhead, its intense rays making it impossible for her to keep her eyes open. She reached out her hand to shield herself.
0:27:15|0:27:25|Saying that, [White Water Saintess] extended her sleeve and swung it towards [Fang Baoyu]. The first one to stand up and block was hit, and seeing this, [Fang Baoyu] stepped forward and pushed the first one away. The first one was pushed by this palm and flew out, falling to the ground.
0:27:49|0:27:53|That night, [Fang Baoyu] sat cross-legged on the bed, treating Mi Xian's injuries.
0:27:53|0:27:59|Mi Xian sat in front of [Fang Baoyu], his hands falling from the top of his head, while [White Water Holy Mother] peeked through the door crack.
0:28:10|0:28:16|[Bai Shui Shengmu] slipped away from the door, and when [Fang Baoyu] turned around, he saw a fleeting figure and immediately chased after it.
0:28:16|0:28:21|[Fang Baoyu] came to the open space in front of the door, and [White Water Saintess] was standing with her back to him.
0:28:35|0:28:39|As soon as the words fell, [Fang Baoyu] drew his sword and rushed towards [White Water Saint Mother].
0:28:39|0:28:42|[Fang Baoyu] soared in the palace, thrusting the sword towards the opponent.
0:28:42|0:28:46|After [Bai Shuishengmu] dodged, she then wrestled with him.
0:28:46|0:28:52|While [Bai Shuishengmu] was taking the opportunity to attack the chest of [Fang Baoyu] with her hands, [Duchess Tuo Chen] suddenly appeared and intercepted the blow.
0:28:52|0:28:54|Immediately, [White Water Holy Mother] flew towards the distance.
0:29:3|0:29:6|At this moment, [Fang Baoyu] glanced to the side and smiled.
0:30:0|0:30:5|Mulang Shenjun and Huyan Dazang sat by the riverbank, their shoulders touching.
0:30:30|0:30:40|On this day, at the martial arts competition, [Wang Dian] stood up with a smile and bowed to everyone. [Purple Marquis] and others sat beside him. After bowing, [Wang Dian] straightened his back with his hands behind him.
0:31:49|0:31:53|The relationship is ambiguous.
0:32:12|0:32:15|[Wang Dian] waved his hand to signal the attendant to bring [Zhu'er] out.
0:32:15|0:32:17|Everyone looked towards the distance.
0:32:17|0:32:21|At this moment, [Zhu'er] was brought out with her hands tied from the crowd.
0:33:8|0:33:19|At this moment, Bai Yanzhu suddenly flew out from behind the octagonal arena, landing on the ground and walking forward. She was followed by a group of guards, with Duchess Tuo Chen, Ben Yue, and Mulang Shenjun standing beside her.
0:33:19|0:33:24|[Wang Dian] fixed his gaze ahead, [Zhu Er] also turned to look at [Duchess Tuo Chen], who was also staring at [Zhu Er].
0:33:28|0:33:35|At this moment, [Duchess Tuo Chen] smiled gently, while the crowd on the platform exuded a fierce momentum.
0:33:41|0:33:52|On the opposite side, [Wang Dian]'s face twitched, then [Huyan Dazang] walked out from the center of the group with a sword in hand. All eyes turned to [Huyan Dazang], who slowly walked towards [Wang Dian] and stood in the middle of the road.
0:33:52|0:34:1|At this moment, [Wang Dian] sitting beside [Fang Baoyu] was frowning and staring intently at [Huyan Dazang], with [Wang Dian]'s gaze also falling on [Huyan Dazang].
0:34:52|0:34:59|At this moment, [Fang Baoyu] slowly stood up, then walked through the crowd and approached [Huyan Dazang], while the others nervously watched [Huyan Dazang] from the side.
0:34:59|0:35:3|[Huyan Dazang] stood still without showing any emotions, his calm face revealing no signs of panic.
0:35:3|0:35:10|[Fang Baoyu] slowly approached [Huyan Dazang], who was holding a sword in his hand, then calmly raised his head to stare at [Fang Baoyu].
0:36:20|0:36:25|Shortly after, the two put away their swords.
0:36:25|0:36:31|On the other side, Ben Yue was in the room, trembling as she picked up the dagger hidden under the pillow, holding it tightly in her hand.
0:36:36|0:36:45|Finally, he slowly pulled out the dagger, inching it towards his wrist. Trembling, he slid it forcefully.
0:36:45|0:36:50|[Duchess Tuo Chen] frowned and gritted her teeth, blood gradually staining her shoes.
0:36:56|0:36:59|At this moment, everyone dared to step forward and gather around the bed.
0:37:7|0:37:13|[Ben Yue] weakly sat up and looked at [Fang Baoyu], while [Purple Marquis] sat by the bed, supporting [Ben Yue]'s shoulders with a smile on his face.
0:37:50|0:38:0|Speak, [Ben Yue] looked at [Wang Dian] standing in front of her. On this day, [Fang Baoyu] slowly woke up from the bed. She turned her head to look beside her, [Zhu'er] was leaning on [Fang Baoyu]'s shoulder, sound asleep.
0:38:0|0:38:12|[Fang Baoyu] suddenly sat up straight, and at that moment [Zhu'er] also jolted awake from her dream, quickly sitting up and staring at [Fang Baoyu] in shock.
0:38:22|0:38:27|[Zhu'er] slapped [Fang Baoyu] in the face, while [Wang Tianzheng] paced back and forth anxiously.
0:38:46|0:38:52|At this moment, the door of the room suddenly swung open, and [Fang Baoyu], who was dressing, fixed his gaze on the doorway.
0:38:52|0:39:1|[Ben Yue] stood blankly outside the door, dressed in gorgeous attire with a flower crown on her head. Beside her, [Zhou Er] was in a panic. [Ben Yue] furrowed her brows, looking at [Fang Baoyu] with sadness.
0:39:30|0:39:33|Speak, [Ben Yue] turned and left.
0:39:33|0:39:37|Outside the house, at the martial arts competition, [Huyan Dazang] strides forward angrily.
0:39:39|0:39:44|[Wang Dian], [Purple Marquis], and others all gazed at [Huyan Dazang], as everyone stood in place discussing animatedly.
0:39:44|0:39:53|At that moment, [Ben Yue] suddenly rushed in, wearing a phoenix coronet and holding an arrow in hand, heading straight towards [Huyan Dazang]. The attention of the crowd was immediately drawn to [Ben Yue].
0:39:53|0:40:0|At this moment, [Purple Marquis] looked up and saw [Ben Yue], who was waving his arrows and charging towards [Huyan Dazang].
0:40:12|0:40:14|Shortly after, [Fang Baoyu] and [Zhu'er] also arrived one after another.
0:40:32|0:40:35|[Huyan Dazang] suddenly turned his head and looked at [Zhu'er].
0:40:53|0:40:59|With a shout, [Huyan Dazang] drew his sword and thrust it towards [Fang Baoyu], who ducked and dodged.
0:40:59|0:41:6|[Fang Baoyu] grabbed [Huyan Dazang]'s hand and was then kicked away.
0:41:6|0:41:12|At this moment, Purple Marquis blocked Huyan Dazang's sword, and Zhu'er stepped forward to hug Huyan Dazang with tearful eyes.
0:41:26|0:41:31|Later, [Huyan Dazang] embraced [Zhu'er], tears soaking his eyes.
0:41:31|0:41:37|At that moment, [Wang Dian] on the side was muttering something with his mouth opening and closing, when suddenly [Zhu'er] widened her eyes.
0:41:41|0:41:45|Immediately, [Huyan Dazang] showed a pained expression as he trembled while holding [Zhu'er]'s hand.
0:41:45|0:41:52|He slowly released Duchess Tuo Chen's embrace, and as he lowered his head, Duchess Tuo Chen instantly drew out the dagger.
0:41:52|0:41:57|Huyan Dazang stared with wide eyes at the dagger in Fang Baoyu's hand, covered in blood, then looked at Fang Baoyu's face.
0:41:57|0:42:11|At this moment, a sly smile appeared on [Zhu'er]'s face. The people around her gathered to watch, and [Huyan Dazang] clutched his stomach in pain, looking at [Zhu'er] in agony. Then he trembled, released the sword in his hand, and fell down.
0:42:11|0:42:16|[Zhu'er] then looked at [Huyan Dazang] lying on the ground beside her, the dagger in her hand still dripping with blood.
0:42:27|0:42:34|Shortly after, a smoke bomb was thrown by [Bai Yanzhu]'s henchmen, and they promptly disappeared.
0:42:34|0:42:39|On this day, [Zhu'er] staggered to a stone staircase, weakly climbing the steps but fell by the roadside.
0:42:39|0:42:44|He then looked up at the plaque in front of him, which read "Qingfeng An".
0:42:44|0:42:50|He exerted himself to prop up his body and continued to climb upwards. Shortly after, [Zhu'er] staggered to the front gate of Qingfeng An.
0:43:4|0:43:10|[Zhu Er] leaned against the gate and fainted. At that moment, a nun inside noticed him.
0:43:10|0:43:15|Outside the military camp, soldiers were guarding the gate tightly, and [Mulang Shenjun] walked towards the camp.
0:43:15|0:43:19|At this moment, [Fang Baoyu] is hiding in a clump of grass outside, secretly observing.
0:43:21|0:43:28|On the other side of the street, it was very lively. [Huyan Dazang] walked unsteadily in the middle of the street alone, with a flight of stairs catching his eye.
0:43:28|0:43:35|[Huyan Dazang] swaggered over with his sword, then sat on the steps and placed the sword beside him.
0:43:35|0:43:41|Three beggars sat around watching the weakened Huyan Dazang.
0:43:41|0:43:46|The beggars turned back one after another, [Huyan Dazang] was closing his eyes and resting on the steps.
0:43:50|0:43:55|The three beggars stared intently at the sword beside [Huyan Dazang], cautiously approaching him.
0:43:55|0:44:1|The leading beggar with a crutch approached [Huyan Dazang], while another beggar reached for the sword beside him.
0:44:1|0:44:6|At this moment, [Huyan Dazang] opened his eyes and kicked the beggar in the chest.
0:44:17|0:44:25|As they were talking, a beggar knocked down [Huyan Dazang] with a crutch, and three people punched and kicked [Huyan Dazang].
0:44:25|0:44:29|At this moment, [Zhu'er] suddenly walked out from the crowd.
0:44:42|0:44:46|[Zhu'er] bent down to look at [Huyan Dazang], who raised his head and looked at [Zhu'er] with an anxious expression.
0:44:46|0:44:55|Huyan Dazang recalled that, in the rapeseed field, [Duchess Tuo Chen] cried and tried to commit suicide with a knife. Dazang stopped her with his hand, leaving a trace of blood on the knife.
0:44:55|0:44:59|Dazang recalled how at the martial arts competition, Duchess Tuo Chen stabbed into his body with a dagger.
0:45:13|0:45:18|It's late at night, in the military camp, soldiers are carrying iron spears on their shoulders, marching in formation.
0:45:18|0:45:24|In the military camp, the war flags fluttered, and the blazing bonfire emitted hot sparks. A row of soldiers was walking past.
0:45:24|0:45:28|Suddenly, [Fang Baoyu] covered the soldier's mouth and nose, pressing him against the wall.
0:45:49|0:45:52|[Fang Baoyu] immediately raised his hand and knocked out the soldier.
0:45:52|0:45:55|A figure flashed past the tent, and [Fang Baoyu] entered the camp.
0:45:55|0:46:0|He quietly lifted the covers on the bed, only to find that it was disguised as a human-shaped bedding.
0:46:0|0:46:3|He then widened his eyes and ran out of the barracks.
0:46:3|0:46:8|At this moment, the soldiers outside were lined up, and [Mulang Shenjun] arrived in front of [Fang Baoyu] with his guards.
0:46:8|0:46:12|In an instant, the two of them gazed at each other, a hint of a smile flashed across [Mulang Shenjun]'s face.
0:46:53|0:47:2|In an instant, a thousand arrows were released simultaneously, and [Fang Baoyu] leaped into the tent. Soldiers rushed out in unison, countless crossbows from all directions aimed at [Fang Baoyu].
0:47:2|0:47:12|[Fang Baoyu] suddenly soared into the air, narrowly escaping the dense barrage of arrows. Just as he leaped into the air, a sudden arrow struck the sword in [Fang Baoyu]'s hand.
0:47:12|0:47:17|As the sun sets in the west, in the desolate wilderness, Fang Baoyu staggers through the vast expanse of the desert.
0:47:18|0:47:29|Suddenly, [Fang Baoyu] fell to the ground. She struggled to prop herself up with her hands, trying to get up, but her body felt as heavy as if it were filled with lead.
0:47:29|0:47:36|In the early morning, [Zhu'er] placed the chopped vegetables by the pot, and at that moment, [Huyan Dazang] walked in.
0:47:57|0:48:2|[Zhu'er] was pulled back by [Huyan Dazang] as she turned around. She turned back and looked into [Huyan Dazang]'s affectionate eyes.
0:48:50|0:49:7|[Huyan Dazang] stepped forward to continue holding [Zhu'er]'s hand. At this moment, the two locked eyes. The delicate beauty of [Zhu'er]'s face reflected in [Huyan Dazang]'s eyes. [Zhu'er] furrowed her brows as she looked at the hand being held, then gazed into [Huyan Dazang]'s eyes. She gently withdrew her hand, leaving [Huyan Dazang]'s hand suspended in the air, trembling slightly.
0:49:8|0:49:11|The black-clothed guest from Qingping Villa, a touch of the setting sun, the seven evil spirits.
0:49:41|0:49:46|The mysterious figure turned around and took off the hat. [Mulang Shenjun] took a closer look and realized it was [Bai Sankong].
0:49:46|0:49:50|[Bai Sankong] stood up straight, with his hands crossed in front of his chest.
0:50:8|0:50:10|In the desert, [Fang Baoyu] stood up and stared at the broken boat.
0:50:11|0:50:11|[Fang Baoyu] stood up anxiously to look for me after hearing the news.
0:50:43|0:50:48|[Fang Baoyu] listened, then turned around with a dejected look, staring blankly at the ground.
0:51:35|0:51:42|Previously, people in the martial arts world thought it was just a rumor, because the court didn't want the outside world to know about this news, which sparked a treasure-hunting craze.
0:51:42|0:51:45|But now Lord Yan has different ideas.
0:52:58|0:53:3|His goal is to eradicate the martial arts community in the Central Plains.
0:53:3|0:53:5|Regardless of being righteous or evil,
0:53:29|0:53:34|That night, the group of children entered the cabin, with [Huyan Dazang] sitting at the table.
0:54:33|0:54:46|[Huyan Dazang] looked deeply into the eyes of [Zhu'er], the candlelight reflecting on their faces, a faint smile appearing on [Huyan Dazang]'s face.
0:54:46|0:54:51|Dazang lowered his eyes slightly, and [Zhu'er] stared at his face, then lowered her head as well.
0:55:21|0:55:27|Under the scorching sun in the desert, [Ben Yue] handed a steamed bun to [Fang Baoyu] sitting on a sand dune.
0:55:27|0:55:30|[Fang Baoyu] turned his head and looked at [Ben Yue] beside him.
0:56:38|0:56:41|At this moment, [Fang Baoyu] furrowed his brows tightly, staring angrily ahead.
0:56:41|0:56:46|Afterwards, [Fang Baoyu] accompanied by [Ben Yue] and [Duchess Tuo Chen], passed by a teahouse.
0:56:46|0:56:49|The tea guests at the door are drinking tea.
0:57:3|0:57:8|Three people sat down randomly, and the shopkeeper poured tea for them.
0:57:8|0:57:15|Shortly after, the shopkeeper turned and left. Suddenly, [Fang Baoyu] looked down at the shopkeeper's feet.
0:57:15|0:57:20|At this moment, [Ben Yue] picked up a teacup to drink, but was stopped alertly by [Fang Baoyu].
0:58:1|0:58:6|In an instant, a hidden arrow shot out from the plate carried by the shopkeeper, and [Fang Baoyu] dodged backwards.
0:58:6|0:58:11|In an instant, the shopkeeper drew a knife and stabbed towards [Fang Baoyu], who quickly dodged.
0:58:11|0:58:18|Immediately, the tea guests in the shop stood up one after another, took off their civilian clothes to reveal their military uniforms, and the leader, holding a knife, charged towards [Fang Baoyu].
0:58:18|0:58:26|The soldiers rushed towards [Fang Baoyu] with knives, and as [Fang Baoyu] turned around and fell down, he tripped another soldier with his leg along with others.
0:58:26|0:58:30|He waved his arrows, blocking the incoming soldiers, his agile movements creating multiple shadows in the air.
0:58:31|0:58:34|[Fang Baoyu] shot an arrow and took down two soldiers.
0:58:34|0:58:38|At this moment, Mulang Shenjun appeared, watching as Fang Baoyu placed an arrow against the soldier's neck.
0:58:46|0:58:50|In an instant, dozens of soldiers suddenly appeared at the door, standing behind [Mulang Shenjun].
0:58:53|0:58:57|[Fang Baoyu] widened his eyes, looking at the soldiers holding precious arrows in their hands, then stared at [Mulang Shenjun].
0:58:59|0:59:15|[Fang Baoyu] held a knife to the soldier's neck, [Mulang Shenjun] squinted his eyes and stared at [Fang Baoyu]. [Fang Baoyu] stood still, looking at [Mulang Shenjun]. Then, he slowly loosened his grip on the knife, and the knife slipped from his hand.
0:59:29|0:59:40|[Mulang Shenjun] stood in the hall, looking towards Duchess Tuo Chen. Then [Mulang Shenjun] turned around to face Duchess Tuo Chen, who also shifted her gaze to him, and the two locked eyes.
0:59:40|0:59:45|Mulang Shenjun gazed at Duchess Tuo Chen with tears in his eyes, then slowly walked towards her.
0:59:47|0:59:56|Mulang Shenjun slowly approached Duchess Tuo Chen, he turned his body sideways and looked at Duchess Tuo Chen beside him. Duchess Tuo Chen stood still, gazing straight ahead.
0:59:56|0:59:59|Shortly after, [Mulang Shenjun] bent down to untie [Duchess Tuo Chen].
1:0:1|1:0:4|Duchess Tuo Chen lowered her gaze, tears welling up in her eyes.
1:0:4|1:0:12|Mulang Shenjun untied the rope tied around Duchess Tuo Chen's body, and they faced each other as Duchess Tuo Chen looked ahead weakly.
1:0:12|1:0:15|At this moment, Mulang Shenjun's concerned gaze appeared particularly intense.
1:0:15|1:0:21|Immediately, [Mulang Shenjun] supported [Duchess Tuo Chen]'s body, and [Duchess Tuo Chen] gazed into [Mulang Shenjun]'s eyes.
1:0:27|1:0:31|Duchess Tuo Chen, with tears in her eyes, furrowed her brow and then pushed Mulang Shenjun away.
1:0:43|1:0:57|It's late at night, [Fang Baoyu] is shackled and trapped in a small room. She gently moves the stones under her feet, her eyes occasionally glancing forward. [Ben Yue] is also tied up tightly, her eyes closed.
1:0:57|1:1:6|[Fang Baoyu] shaves the stone to [Ben Yue], who then catches it with his foot.
1:1:6|1:1:10|[Ben Yue] listened and lowered her eyes slightly, then she rolled her eyeballs.
1:1:59|1:2:7|At that moment, [Bai Sankong] opened the door and walked in.
1:2:7|1:2:11|Since early morning, [Huyan Dazang] and [Zhu'er] were walking on a narrow path with the abbess.
1:2:11|1:2:14|[Huyan Dazang] carried a sword as he walked side by side with several others.
1:2:22|1:2:27|After the Abbess finished speaking, she bowed to the two and left. The surrounding flowers and plants were lush, with a strong fragrance in the air.
1:2:31|1:2:34|Later, the abbess turned around with tears in her eyes to look at [Zhu'er].
1:2:34|1:2:38|Following that, Abbess Tuo Chen nodded slightly and turned to leave.
1:2:38|1:2:40|[Zhu'er] stood still, gazing at the departure of Master.
1:2:40|1:2:44|A gentle breeze blew by, causing the willow trees around to tremble slightly.
1:2:44|1:2:49|Suddenly, [Huyan Dazang] turned tightly and drew his sword to block the flying crossbow bolt.
1:2:49|1:2:51|Immediately, another sword flew and struck [Zhu'er].
1:2:54|1:2:59|[Zhu'er] ran towards Reverend Mother crying, and [Huyan Dazang] immediately turned around and drew his sword.
1:3:12|1:3:17|[Wang Dian] took out a dagger and threw it on the ground, while [Zhu'er] looked down at the ground.
1:3:28|1:3:31|[Huyan Dazang] drew his sword and confronted [Wang Dian].
1:3:39|1:3:42|The abbess turned to look at the frowning [Zhu'er].
1:3:51|1:4:6|[Zhu'er] looked at [Huyan Dazang] with teary eyes, and [Huyan Dazang] sheathed his sword and stood up straight.
1:4:6|1:4:17|The abbess fell to the ground, and then [Huyan Dazang] immediately drew his sword to duel with [Wang Dian]. Their swords clashed continuously, and [Wang Dian]'s men also stepped forward to fight. [Huyan Dazang] injured one of the men and then leaped into the air.
1:4:19|1:4:23|[Huyan Dazang] landed from the sky and chopped down one of his subordinates.
1:4:23|1:4:27|At this moment, [Wang Dian] suddenly launched an attack, and [Huyan Dazang] lifted his sword to defend against it.
1:4:27|1:4:32|Following that, [Huyan Dazang] squatted on the ground, spinning like a top, then swung his sword towards [Wang Dian].
1:4:36|1:4:40|[Wang Dian] was beaten to half squat on the ground, then he stood up and struggled to resist.
1:4:40|1:4:47|At this moment, [Huyan Dazang] took the opportunity to kick [Wang Dian] in the chest, sending him flying several meters away. Meanwhile, [Ben Yue] was kneeling beside the abbess.
1:4:55|1:5:2|[Wang Dian] soared into the air, landing a kick on the chest of [Huyan Dazang]. As he descended, he closed in, pressing [Huyan Dazang] back with each strike.
1:5:2|1:5:6|In an instant, the two arrived next to [Zhu'er] and Master.
1:5:6|1:5:12|At that moment, [Wang Dian] launched an attack towards [Huyan Dazang], who dodged to the side and caught [Wang Dian]'s sword with his own.
1:5:13|1:5:18|Shortly after, [Huyan Dazang] exerted force to lift upwards, and [Wang Dian]'s sword instantly flew out of his hand.
1:5:18|1:5:27|[Huyan Dazang] struck [Wang Dian]'s foot with the hilt of his sword, then kicked him to the ground and pointed the sword at him, causing a large amount of blood to spray from [Wang Dian]'s mouth.
1:5:31|1:5:37|As Huyan Dazang raised his sword towards Wang Dian's chest, Zhuer slowly stood up and walked towards Wang Dian.
1:6:17|1:6:23|[Zhu'er] turned and walked towards the distance, paused for a moment, and then continued to leave.
1:6:23|1:6:30|In the small room, the crystal-clear Qiongjiang jade leaves were poured into the cup, Mulang Shenjun picked up the cup and drank, while Bai Sankong stood aside.
1:7:18|1:7:23|Speak up, Bai Sankong, who was about to leave, stopped in his tracks and turned to look at Mulang Shenjun.
1:7:23|1:7:28|In the Clear Wind Nunnery on the other side, [Zhu'er] was bowing to the abbess's wooden tablet while burning incense.
1:7:28|1:7:34|Next to the wooden sign are fruits and offerings, outside the house, the sunlight shines in, making it look particularly cold.
1:7:34|1:7:39|[Huyan Dazang] sat behind the table next to [Zhu Er], looking at [Zhu Er]. After [Zhu Er] lit the incense, she sat down next to [Huyan Dazang].
1:9:1|1:9:5|[Zhu'er] held [Huyan Dazang]'s hand, and a smile appeared on [Huyan Dazang]'s face.
1:9:5|1:9:11|At this moment, [Fang Baoyu] is standing in the main hall, staring straight at [Mulang Shenjun].
1:9:28|1:9:32|As night fell, [Huyan Dazang] and [Wang Dian] hid in the bushes, secretly observing.
1:9:32|1:9:37|On the distant hillside, a group of people are engaged in a fierce battle with swords and knives.
1:9:37|1:9:48|[Wang Dian] furrowed his brow, watching the fight below with full concentration.
1:9:48|1:9:54|Just as [Huyan Dazang] was about to go investigate, [Fang Baoyu] from a distance, with his face covered, flew over waving his sword. [Huyan Dazang] stopped in his tracks.
1:10:19|1:10:23|Shortly after, [Fang Baoyu], [Huyan Dazang], and [Zhu'er] arrived together at an inn.
1:10:39|1:10:45|[Huyan Dazang] raised his glass, [Fang Baoyu] smiled and clinked glasses with [Huyan Dazang].
1:10:45|1:10:51|At this moment, a piece of paper suddenly fell from the tree outside the door, and the three of them picked up their swords and ran outside the house.
1:10:51|1:10:54|[Fang Baoyu] went to pick up the paper ball, looked at it, and stood in front of the door with [Huyan Dazang].
1:11:2|1:11:8|[Huyan Dazang] stared at the paper ball, while [Zhu'er] furrowed her brows in contemplation.
1:11:8|1:11:14|On this day, in the military camp of the Thousand Households, [Ben Yue] was tied to a tall pillar, with sharp swords inserted into the ground below.
1:11:14|1:11:22|Mulang Shenjun was leisurely drinking tea while holding a teacup, with Duchess Tuo Chen and Bai Sankong standing beside him. The soldiers behind them were standing in formation neatly.
1:11:22|1:11:26|At this moment, [Huyan Dazang] and [Fang Baoyu] walked in side by side from the main gate.
1:11:26|1:11:29|[Mulang Shenjun] set down the teacup and looked at the two approaching figures.
1:11:29|1:11:31|Half Moon's gaze followed closely behind [Fang Baoyu] as he walked.
1:11:46|1:11:54|I ask you one last time, [Mulang Shenjun] looked expressionless and then bent forward.
1:11:56|1:12:0|The crowd looked over here one after another, [Ben Yue] anxiously gazing at [Fang Baoyu].
1:12:0|1:12:3|Bai Sankong and Duchess Tuo Chen also looked over.
1:12:3|1:12:9|At that moment, [Mulang Shenjun] suddenly soared into the air and rushed towards [Fang Baoyu].
1:12:9|1:12:14|In an instant, the two drew their swords and fought each other, while the surrounding soldiers also wielded their swords in battle.
1:12:15|1:12:23|At this moment, the swords of [Fang Baoyu] and [Mulang Shenjun] clashed, while behind them, [Bai Sankong] and [Huyan Dazang] also engaged in a fierce battle.
1:12:23|1:12:26|[Huyan Dazang] and [Bai Sankong] faced each other in the palm of their hands, then quickly separated.
1:12:31|1:12:35|At this moment, the two of them stepped back and quickly stood firm.
1:12:35|1:12:40|Immediately, [Bai Sankong] swiftly rushed towards [Huyan Dazang], who defended against the attack with his sword.
1:12:40|1:12:44|Next, Huyan Dazang kept attacking with his sword, causing Bai Sankong to retreat repeatedly.
1:12:44|1:12:51|At this moment, the soldiers on the side rushed towards [Huyan Dazang] with their swords. [Huyan Dazang] defended against the attack and cut down the soldiers one by one.
1:12:52|1:12:55|Duchess Tuo Chen and Ben Yue on the side looked on anxiously.
1:12:55|1:12:58|On the other side, [Fang Baoyu] kept flying up to attack the wooden wolf.
1:12:58|1:13:4|Just as [Fang Baoyu] launched an attack, Mulang soared into the air and stabbed towards [Fang Baoyu] with his sword.
1:13:4|1:13:8|At this moment, [Fang Baoyu] leaned back, his body hanging in the air to dodge this sword.
1:13:8|1:13:12|Immediately, she pushed off with her foot, keeping parallel with Mulang and the others.
1:13:13|1:13:33|[Fang Baoyu] exerted force with his sword, separating from Mulang and standing still. Then, [Fang Baoyu] soared into the air and swiftly landed next to Mulang. The two immediately drew their swords and faced each other. Mulang's strike was blocked by [Fang Baoyu]'s sword, then Mulang flew to the side. [Fang Baoyu] stood with his sword in hand, watching Mulang.
1:13:33|1:13:39|Mulang stood straight and looked down at his own body, then raised his head. Duchess Tuo Chen looked at them anxiously.
1:13:47|1:13:50|In an instant, Mulang clenched the knife in his hand and threw it towards [Ben Yue].
1:13:50|1:13:57|At this moment, a pair of sleeves blocked the sword flying towards [Ben Yue], [Duchess Tuo Chen] was flying in the air towards [Ben Yue].
1:13:57|1:14:2|Immediately, he cut the rope binding [Ben Yue] and rescued [Ben Yue] in one fell swoop.
1:14:2|1:14:6|The Purple Marquis and Ben Yue landed on the ground, surrounded by soldiers pointing weapons at them.
1:14:6|1:14:12|Yanzhu knocked down a row of soldiers with his sleeve, and then [Purple Marquis] also took down the incoming soldiers one by one with his sword.
1:14:13|1:14:20|The Purple Marquis broke the wooden spears in the soldiers' hands and threw them aside, then stabbed another soldier in the chest with the iron sword on the spear.
1:14:20|1:14:26|At the same time, Yan Zhu used his sleeves to sweep up the swords on the ground, and then flung them towards the soldiers charging towards him.
1:14:26|1:14:34|The soldiers were immediately pierced by swords and fell to the ground.
1:14:34|1:14:42|While Bai Yanzhu kept launching attacks, Bai Sankong suddenly grabbed Yanzhu's sleeve tightly with his hand, then he extended his palm towards Yanzhu.
1:14:55|1:14:58|Yanzhu was knocked down to the ground, and [Purple Marquis] helped Yanzhu up.
1:14:58|1:15:3|At that moment, Mulang Shenjun rushed over and clasped hands with Purple Marquis.
1:15:3|1:15:6|The Purple Marquis's body trembled, while Mulang Shenjun's eyes were fierce.
1:15:6|1:15:9|Immediately after, [Purple Marquis] leaned back and spat out blood.
1:15:14|1:15:19|[Fang Baoyu] brought [Ben Yue] running over, and the soldiers swarmed in.
1:15:19|1:15:22|[Huyan Dazang] and [Fang Baoyu] turned and ran towards the door.
1:15:22|1:15:31|At this moment, the well-armed soldiers caught up from behind, and the group of people huddled together and fled.
1:15:31|1:15:35|Soldiers chased closely behind, hundreds of arrows shot towards [Huyan Dazang] and the others.
1:15:40|1:15:52|Duchess Tuo Chen flew down from the eaves and landed in front of the soldiers. At that moment, Mulang Shenjun happened to arrive from the back of the group and stared at Duchess Tuo Chen who stood still in place, while she quietly looked at him.
1:15:52|1:15:58|Shortly after, [Purple Marquis] supported the Duchess Tuo Chen to a desolate plain with a broken dam.
1:16:20|1:16:26|The Purple Marquis embraces Yan Zhu, just as Bai Yanzhu walks in.
1:16:53|1:16:57|Marquis Zi Yi sheathed the sword he had drawn and then left.
1:16:57|1:17:4|Yan Zhuxu weakly leaned against a pillar, with Bai Sankong standing in front of him, gazing at him.
1:17:18|1:17:20|Could it be that even your son [Fang Baoyu]?
1:18:9|1:18:20|[Bai Sankong] took out a bottle from his clothes and placed it in front of Yan Zhu. Yan Zhu sat there motionless, leaning weakly against the chair, with tears shimmering in his eyes.
1:19:11|1:19:18|[Purple Marquis] held the Yan Zhu beside him and nodded to signal Yan Zhu.
1:20:12|1:20:16|The jade pendant is a family heirloom of Huyan Feiteng.
1:21:1|1:21:5|Huyan Dazang turned and left, leaving Yan Zhu standing in place.
1:21:5|1:21:19|Tears gushed from Yan Zhu's eyes, and [Purple Marquis] came forward to hold Yan Zhu's shoulders. Tears continued to fall from Yan Zhu's face as his eyes remained fixed on the direction Huyan Dazang had left.
1:21:19|1:21:28|At the same time, [Bai Sankong] was waving his hands, playing with Qin Xian, who kept dancing, while [Mulang Shenjun] sat aside drinking tea.
1:21:32|1:21:38|Shortly after, [Bai Sankong] listened to the movements in his hand and looked up at [Mulang Shenjun] with a piercing gaze.
1:21:38|1:21:42|Mulang Shenjun slowly walked forward and stood directly in front of Bai Sankong.
1:22:1|1:22:2|Immediately, [Bai Sankong] placed his hands on the strings and began to practice.
1:22:18|1:22:25|He gently plucked the strings of the qin.
1:22:25|1:22:28|Suddenly, Mulang Shenjun's clothes were cut with a mark.
1:22:28|1:22:31|Later, Mulang Shenjun and Bai Sankong looked at each other.
1:22:31|1:22:34|Bai Sankong continued to wave his fingers and started playing the zither.
1:22:34|1:22:38|As the strings of the qin vibrated, Mulang Shenjun's clothes were torn again.
1:22:38|1:22:41|Mulang Shenjun looked down at his clothes, then glanced at Bai Sankong.
1:22:41|1:22:46|Bai Sankong's movements intensified, and with a wave of his hands, the hemp rope on the pillar instantly broke.
1:23:33|1:23:42|As soon as the words fell, the two pressed their hands on the zither, then raised their arms and clashed together, their hands touching before being pushed apart.
1:23:42|1:23:49|At this moment, a hand slapped the table, and the ancient zither flew up instantly. The two of them then fought fiercely under the suspended ancient zither.
1:23:49|1:23:59|Shortly after, [Bai Sankong] hugged the ancient qin and plucked the strings, causing the strings to burst out. [Mulang Shenjun] flew backwards as the strings cut through the flagpole. [Mulang Shenjun] then grabbed the flagpole and threw it towards [Bai Sankong].
1:23:59|1:24:12|[Bai Sankong] supported his body with the zither, Mulang Shenjun's palm sent the zither flying, and [Bai Sankong] caught it again to continue playing. The waves produced by the zither strings shattered the wooden table, while Mulang Shenjun hung in the air, and [Bai Sankong] kept pressing on the zither strings.
1:24:22|1:24:28|In an instant, Mulang flew up and blocked Bai Sankong's string attack with one hand.
1:24:28|1:24:34|[Bai Sankong] exerted force in his string dance, causing Mulang to be knocked away, and his sleeves were instantly torn to shreds.
1:24:43|1:24:48|[Bai Sankong] kept waving the strings of the zither, when Mulan stepped forward and pushed the ancient zither.
1:24:48|1:24:55|Mulang was knocked away to the side, then suddenly, Mulang extended a hand backwards, and Mulang Ting behind him was instantly shattered into two halves.
1:24:55|1:25:0|[Bai Sankong] stared at Mulang with wide eyes, blood slowly seeping out of his ears.
1:25:0|1:25:5|Shortly after, Mulang pushed hard, and the ancient qin instantly turned into pieces.
1:25:5|1:25:8|Just then, Mulang suddenly exerted force and sent [Bai Sankong] flying into the air.
1:25:48|1:25:58|[Bai Sankong] continuously spewed out a large amount of blood from his mouth, while Fang Baoyu held onto [Bai Sankong]. At this moment, Yan Zhu slowly walked to the edge of the bed, tears welling up in her eyes.
1:26:14|1:26:18|Bai Sankong slowly reached out his hand, Yan Zhu, tears streaming down her face, went to hold Bai Sankong's hand.
1:26:32|1:26:42|On this day, [Fang Baoyu] stood in front of [Mulang Shenjun] with a frown on his face. Just as he rushed forward with his sword, four iron spears shot out from the floorboards, and [Fang Baoyu] managed to cut off one of them.
1:26:42|1:26:49|Immediately, several burly soldiers rushed onto the wooden bridge, surrounding [Fang Baoyu] and pointing dozens of iron spears at [Fang Baoyu]'s neck.
1:26:50|1:27:9|Soldiers surrounded [Fang Baoyu] in circles. [Fang Baoyu] remained calm and composed. In an instant, he raised his sword and charged towards the soldiers. Dozens of iron spears followed, attacking [Fang Baoyu]. He leaped up, and the soldiers thrust their spears upwards. [Fang Baoyu] landed lightly, perfectly balanced on the tip of a spear, before gracefully stepping off.
1:27:9|1:27:20|He launched attacks against the soldiers with each sword strike, causing the surrounding soldiers to fall off the wooden bridge and crash heavily to the ground. [Fang Baoyu] turned around to look at [Mulang Shenjun], who raised his sword and charged towards [Fang Baoyu] in silence.
1:27:20|1:27:26|[Fang Baoyu] dodged and then grappled with [Mulang Shenjun], the two of them wielding swords and moving swiftly.
1:27:26|1:27:31|Just as [Mulang Shenjun] was about to step onto the wooden bridge, the plank beneath his feet suddenly broke.
1:27:31|1:27:37|Following that, a hole opened up in the wooden bridge, and [Mulang Shenjun] hurriedly flew up high and then landed on the wooden steps behind him.
1:27:37|1:27:44|[Fang Baoyu] fixed his gaze and saw [Huyan Dazang] standing below, holding a sword on a broken wooden plank, then he lifted his head and looked at [Fang Baoyu].
1:27:45|1:27:50|[Huyan Dazang] stepped on the wooden board under his feet, and the board immediately flipped up and landed on the bridge pillar.
1:27:50|1:27:57|[Huyan Dazang] stepped onto the bridge, standing side by side with [Fang Baoyu], both holding swords and facing [Mulang Shenjun] on the other side.
1:27:57|1:27:58|At this moment, [Mulang Shenjun] also raised his sword.
1:28:2|1:28:6|With a shout, [Mulang Shenjun] from across suddenly raised his bow and dashed forward.
1:28:6|1:28:14|Mulang Shenjun flew towards the two, Huyan Dazang and Fang Baoyu immediately turned around, facing Mulang Shenjun's arrow techniques together.
1:28:14|1:28:18|Three people on the bridge kept waving arrows, and [Mulang Shenjun] flew up and kicked [Fang Baoyu].
1:28:19|1:28:21|[Fang Baoyu] lowered his body to dodge.
1:28:21|1:28:27|Immediately, [Fang Baoyu] and [Huyan Dazang] launched an attack towards [Mulang Shenjun], who leaped again to evade the assault.
1:28:27|1:28:34|Under the scorching sun, three individuals kept spinning on the bridge, their swords clashing together, their silhouettes gradually elongated by the sun.
1:28:37|1:28:44|[Fang Baoyu] kept attacking [Mulang Shenjun], both of them moved swiftly, and every attack could be blocked by [Mulang Shenjun].
1:28:44|1:28:48|[Huyan Dazang] spun the sword in his hand and then charged towards the two of them.
1:28:48|1:28:55|[Huyan Dazang] squatted on the ground in an instant, spinning in a pirouette, then he raised his sword above his head and quickly charged towards [Mulang Shenjun].
1:28:55|1:29:2|Mulang Sword clashed, quickly dodged, then [Huyan Dazang] leaped behind Mulang, who immediately turned around to face [Huyan Dazang].
1:29:2|1:29:5|[Huyan Dazang] holds a sword against Mulang's chest, as Mulang stands still.
1:29:6|1:29:14|At that moment, [Huyan Dazang] tore Mulang's clothes, then together with [Fang Baoyu], they kicked Mulang's abdomen, causing him to stagger back repeatedly.
1:29:14|1:29:23|Following that, [Fang Baoyu] and [Huyan Dazang] wielded their swords together, thrusting towards Mulang's abdomen. The sword in Mulang's hand was knocked away, and at the same time, he was pinned against a pillar by the two swords.
1:29:24|1:29:26|He hung precariously on the pillar.
1:29:26|1:29:33|Later, [Fang Baoyu] and [Huyan Dazang] worked together to forcefully pick out the golden silk armor from the clothes of the wooden wolf.
1:29:33|1:29:39|At this moment, Mulang hid behind the guards, then pushed each guard in front of Huyan Dazang and Fang Baoyu.
1:29:39|1:29:43|[Huyan Dazang] and [Fang Baoyu] encountered one and killed one, causing the soldier to be beaten and rolled off the bridge.
1:29:43|1:29:47|Soon after, two soldiers arrived, and [Fang Baoyu] and [Huyan Dazang] stabbed the approaching soldiers with a single blow.
1:29:51|1:29:58|As the two slowly moved the bodies of the soldiers in front of their eyes with swords, Mulang appeared in front of them, only a foot away.
1:29:58|1:30:3|Later, when Mulang Shenjun struck towards the chests of the two with his palm, Huyan Dazang and Fang Baoyu both frowned.
1:30:3|1:30:10|Immediately, [Mulang Shenjun] turned his palm and pushed hard, causing [Huyan Dazang] and [Fang Baoyu] to be thrown out, then they fell heavily to the ground.
1:30:11|1:30:17|At this moment, [Mulang Shenjun] took the opportunity to pull out [Huyan Dazang]'s sword from the soldier's body, staining [Fang Baoyu]'s face with blood.
1:30:17|1:30:21|[Fang Baoyu] stared with wide eyes at [Mulang Shenjun] holding a sword in front of him.
1:30:21|1:30:26|Mulang Shenjun's eyes revealed a hint of joy, while Huyan Dazang watched quietly on the side.
1:30:26|1:30:31|Afterwards, [Mulang Shenjun] held a sword in his hand, with a slight smile on his face, slowly approaching [Huyan Dazang] and [Fang Baoyu] in front of him.
1:30:31|1:30:34|[Huyan Dazang] half lay on the ground, unable to move while clutching his chest.
1:30:34|1:30:38|[Fang Baoyu] kept backing away, looking at everything in front of him in horror.
1:30:38|1:30:44|[Mulang Shenjun] held the sword, step by step getting closer, the blade still stained with fresh blood.
1:30:44|1:30:49|[Mulang Shenjun] raised his arms and waved the sword, then gripped the handle with both hands, staring straight ahead.
1:30:53|1:31:5|Just as [Mulang Shenjun] was about to stab down with his sword, [Duchess Tuo Chen] suddenly flew in from behind. She thrust a knife into [Mulang Shenjun]'s back, leaving him stunned in place with his sword raised above his head.
1:31:5|1:31:16|Later, [Mulang Shenjun] slowly lowered his head, at this moment, [Duchess Tuo Chen] frowned on her face, tightly gripping the knife that was stabbed into [Mulang Shenjun]'s body, drops of blood slowly sliding down the blade.
1:31:21|1:31:26|Suddenly, Duchess Tuo Chen pulled out the knife and threw it on the ground, causing Mulang Shenjun to clutch his waist and abdomen in pain.
1:31:29|1:31:36|At this moment, [Mulang Shenjun] blinked his eyes, the veins on his forehead and neck bulging, and he slowly turned his head, looking as wet as a person.
1:31:36|1:31:44|Tears moistened Mulang Shenjun's eyes, while Duchess Tuo Chen also frowned, tears continuously flowing from her eyes.
1:31:44|1:31:50|Mulang Shenjun fell heavily to the ground, and Duchess Tuo Chen immediately held him tightly in her arms.
1:31:50|1:31:55|At this moment, [Fang Baoyu] climbed up and sat next to [Mulang Shenjun], staring wide-eyed at [Duchess Tuo Chen] in front of her.
1:32:31|1:32:37|Duchess Tuo Chen stabbed Mulang Shenjun with a dagger, leaving Huyan Dazang and Fang Baoyu wide-eyed.
1:32:37|1:32:43|Duchess Tuo Chen held the slowly stiffening Mulang Shenjun trembling, while Huyan Dazang frowned and watched from the side.
1:32:43|1:32:50|Afterwards, [Mulang Shenjun] slowly slipped from the arms of [Duchess Tuo Chen] and fell straight onto the cold ground.
1:33:1|1:33:8|Speaking, [Huyan Dazang] drew his sword, and [Fang Baoyu] did the same, standing on the river bank facing each other with their swords drawn.
1:33:8|1:33:15|The river breeze rustled the surrounding reeds, causing Huyan Dazang's hair to sway with the wind, while Fang Baoyu's clothes fluttered slightly.
1:33:15|1:33:22|The two immediately rushed towards each other, their swords waving in the air, constantly colliding and intertwining, their figures entwined together.
1:33:22|1:33:27|[Huyan Dazang] waved his sword towards [Fang Baoyu], then the two of them stood back to back and thrust their swords out together.
1:33:30|1:33:36|[Huyan Dazang] turned his head down to attack, [Fang Baoyu] immediately dodged and shot an arrow towards the upper side of [Huyan Dazang].
1:33:36|1:33:40|They then continuously switched positions and maneuvered around each other.
1:33:40|1:33:46|In an instant, [Huyan Dazang] struck [Fang Baoyu]'s arrow, then [Fang Baoyu] swiftly turned around and hit [Huyan Dazang] with a palm strike.
1:33:46|1:33:51|Facing each other, the two immediately flew towards each other.
1:33:51|1:33:54|When two arrows collided, the arrow of [Huyan Dazang] was also split.
1:34:58|1:35:1|This was your father's dying wish.
