0:0:45|0:0:53|On the screen, the People's Liberation Army of China marched in neat rows, coming from a distance in a grand and imposing manner.
0:0:53|0:1:9|In early 1947, after suffering heavy blows on the national battlefield, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits changed their strategic deployment and launched a major offensive against our two liberated areas in Northwest and East China.
0:1:9|0:1:12|Our East China Army carried out Chairman Mao's strategic policy.
0:1:14|0:1:24|PLA soldiers are using horses to transport supplies and advance forward.
0:1:24|0:1:30|The camera pulls back, a cavalry column comes galloping, the long line extends all the way to the dusty distance.
0:1:39|0:1:54|In the retreating army, men carried supplies on horses and single-wheeled carts, while women carried baskets and bundles, some holding children's hands as they hurried forward.
0:1:54|0:1:57|Two soldiers carrying guns walk into the scene.
0:1:59|0:2:4|The squad leader turned his head to the left and saw a building destroyed by war standing on the side.
0:2:22|0:2:27|The two looked ahead, where there were layered distant mountains, [Li Jing] turned to [Liu Yonggui].
0:2:34|0:2:37|The scene changes, with Commander Gao and the instructor walking among the troops.
0:3:1|0:3:4|A soldier walked among the crowd, seeing the civilians leaving with their belongings, each looking dejected and exhausted.
0:3:32|0:3:38|An old man carrying a heavy burden on his back, hands the child in his arms to the woman next to him.
0:3:38|0:3:41|He looked into the distance, shook his head, and sighed.
0:3:41|0:3:45|The soldier lowered his head when he saw it, with a solemn expression.
0:3:45|0:3:52|The camera turns to Commander Gao and the instructor.
0:3:52|0:3:59|The sound of military bugle rang out, and the two of them stopped in their tracks and looked towards the sky behind them. Five planes were flying in a V formation closely following the troops.
0:4:2|0:4:7|The scene shifts, with Commander Gao and the soldiers hiding in the bunker, looking up as the plane flies overhead.
0:4:18|0:4:25|[Commander Gao] furrowed his brow, turned his head away, used his hand to shield the sun from his forehead, and continued to observe the planes in the sky, with [Li Jing] and the squad leader crouching in the shelter.
0:4:27|0:4:33|A soldier turns to [Platoon Leader], the scene changes. On the dusty road, a tank carrying soldiers drives in the middle of the road, while infantry troops march in formation on one side of the road.
0:4:56|0:5:12|The convoy billowed thick black smoke as it followed closely behind. Several soldiers from the back of the vehicles crossed in front of the cars and walked to the other side of the road, with the camera closely following the frontmost car.
0:5:12|0:5:16|Two Nationalist Army officers wearing military caps and coats are listening to the radio inside a car.
0:5:43|0:5:45|The officer who took the map looked pensive.
0:5:50|0:5:51|He bent down and turned off the radio.
0:5:51|0:5:52|The chief of staff nodded.
0:5:52|0:5:53|Based on the combat experience in northern Jiangsu.
0:6:26|0:6:29|The Headmaster looked ahead with a contemptuous gaze.
0:6:44|0:6:55|Hearing the roar of a motorcycle, the Headmaster looked out the window. A soldier on a motorcycle stopped beside the car, holding a document in his hand, and saluted.
0:6:55|0:7:1|The Chief of Staff took the documents and adjusted his glasses.
0:7:1|0:7:12|The Headmaster took the document, read it, threw it down, with a serious expression. The screen went black, then switched to a scene where a large group of PLA soldiers marched towards a river.
0:7:13|0:7:18|Commander Gao and two others walk alongside a group of soldiers carrying rifles.
0:7:18|0:7:23|They stopped by the river and looked across to the other side.
0:7:40|0:7:53|The three turned around, with [Commander Gao] and the instructor mounting their horses, wading through the shallow water, and walking towards the smoky shore with the soldiers.
0:7:53|0:7:59|An elderly woman with her hair in a bun, wearing a mandarin jacket, stood at the village entrance, her hands clasped in front of her, gazing across the river in a trance.
0:8:12|0:8:15|Zhao Yumin took the child and held him in her arms.
0:8:20|0:8:26|[Zhao Yumin] turned around, and a young soldier stood in front of her with a smile, as [Commander Gao] approached.
0:9:9|0:9:17|Zhao Yumin, the village head with neat short hair, is pushing a cart across the river with the villagers as the two look down the slope.
0:9:17|0:9:27|[Zhao Yumin] looked up and saw a woman approaching, followed by a girl in a floral jacket.
0:9:36|0:9:40|Commander Gao turned to Zhao Yumin with a smile.
0:9:59|0:10:2|Commander Gao walked forward with [Zhao Yumin], while the old lady looked puzzled.
0:10:29|0:10:32|Commander Gao looked solemnly into the distance.
0:10:56|0:11:2|A soldier walked out of the team, walked up to [Commander Gao], and saluted.
0:11:26|0:11:33|The soldier saluted and then turned around to return to the main force.
0:11:33|0:11:38|He merged into the team and blended into the advancing torrent.
0:11:38|0:11:43|A soldier rode up on horseback and pulled the reins in front of [Commander Gao].
0:11:50|0:11:51|Commander Gao turns to the guard.
0:11:55|0:12:5|A soldier blows the military bugle, and the large troop stops moving forward. The soldiers turn around in confusion, looking at each other.
0:12:5|0:12:20|The screen goes black, then switches to a scene where night falls. The People's Liberation Army troops are resting in a small grove, soldiers leaning against tree trunks, sitting in groups of two or three. Some are lighting fires for warmth and light, some are repairing guns and shoes, and some are smoking with their heads down.
0:12:32|0:12:40|Li Jing and soldier Wang Chun sat together, Li Jing was cleaning her shoes while Wang Chun sighed with his hands in his pockets.
0:13:2|0:13:3|Huang Chun angrily glared at [Li Jin].
0:13:3|0:13:7|[Li Jin] stood up, straightened his clothes, and walked towards the back.
0:13:30|0:13:35|The scene shifts to a villager carrying a small lantern, bringing a bag of rice into the courtyard.
0:13:35|0:13:38|The villagers were bustling in the courtyard, and [Sister Yonggui] burst into laughter.
0:14:5|0:14:7|At this moment, the village chief [Zhao Yumin] is walking and talking with a soldier.
0:14:7|0:14:7|Zhao Yumin walks towards Erman.
0:14:38|0:14:39|Zhao Yumin continues to walk forward.
0:14:51|0:14:53|[Yonggui's wife] looks awkward.
0:15:9|0:15:13|Captain Liu, with a sigh, lowered his head and remained silent, helplessly shifting his gaze away.
0:15:13|0:15:21|[Zhao Yumin] didn't know what to say for a moment, when a soldier walked up from behind.
0:15:21|0:15:25|[Zhao Yumin] turned around again and walked away with the little soldier, holding a lantern.
0:15:28|0:15:30|The scene cuts to a close-up, with [Zhao Yumin] and [Commander Gao] sitting together.
0:15:40|0:15:46|Commander Gao picked up a cigarette from the table, put it in his mouth, and the young soldier poured a glass of water for Zhao Yumin.
0:15:47|0:15:49|[Zhao Yumin] smiled and put down the notebook in her hand.
0:15:59|0:16:1|[Zhao Yumin] picked up the cup and took a sip of water, then walked to the door and took the kerosene lamp handed to her by the young soldier.
0:16:34|0:16:36|[Zhao Yumin] and the young soldier left together.
0:16:36|0:16:43|The scene changes, in the darkness, two PLA officers walk past the soldiers' camp.
0:17:9|0:17:14|Inside the room, the PLA officers sat around in a meeting.
0:17:17|0:17:23|Most comrades are very eager for battle.
0:17:25|0:17:30|Captain Zhang scooped up a bowl of water from the charcoal and took a sip.
0:17:33|0:17:36|The instructor took the challenge letter and glanced at it before handing it to [Lieutenant].
0:17:36|0:17:44|[Lieutenant] lit a cigarette, lowered his head to read the letter of challenge, with a frown on his forehead.
0:17:45|0:17:48|He scanned the attending cadres.
0:17:56|0:17:59|[Lieutenant] sighed heavily and sat down again.
0:17:59|0:18:6|The instructor and the platoon leader sat on the other side of the table, watching Captain Liu.
0:18:6|0:18:12|The squad leader hesitated for a moment.
0:18:12|0:18:19|[Lieutenant] slammed the table in anger, then sighed helplessly.
0:18:19|0:18:22|He turned around with his hands behind his back, pacing back and forth in the room.
0:18:26|0:18:29|After a while, he looked around and asked:
0:18:32|0:18:39|Everyone fell silent.
0:18:39|0:18:48|Captain Zhang turned and walked away, the instructor looked helplessly at the squad leader, the scene shifted to the camp, looking down from the high ground, flickering lights could be seen in the woods.
0:18:48|0:18:53|The villagers walked along the road carrying lanterns, as [Commander Gao] and Captain Zhang approached and stood on the high ground.
0:18:55|0:19:0|The two of them walked forward and found a place to sit down.
0:19:0|0:19:3|The platoon leader turned to [Commander Gao] and said.
0:19:20|0:19:24|There must be many soldiers in the training camp who are frowning all day long.
0:19:26|0:19:29|The platoon leader furrowed his brow and blinked constantly, lost in thought.
0:20:4|0:20:8|The platoon leader lowered his head in confusion.
0:20:16|0:20:17|Commander Gao laughed.
0:20:56|0:20:57|The company commander laughed.
0:21:25|0:21:28|The [Headmaster] is holding a meeting for the cadres.
0:21:28|0:21:30|The [Headmaster] points to the strategic map behind him.
0:21:30|0:21:31|The cadres are diligently taking notes.
0:21:56|0:22:1|The atmosphere in the room was solemn as the [Headmaster] walked up to the table and looked at the map on it.
0:23:32|0:23:37|[Headmaster] is lost in thought, looking serious.
0:23:48|0:23:50|He continued pointing at the strategic map.
0:23:54|0:23:56|The Headmaster stood up straight, with a smile on his face.
0:24:32|0:24:33|[Headmaster] blinked and gave everyone some guidance.
0:25:2|0:25:9|The [Headmaster] made a gesture of encirclement on the map and looked at everyone.
0:25:9|0:25:15|The cadres also laughed and nodded, and [Headmaster] sat down.
0:25:22|0:25:25|Political Commissar Shi stood up and faced everyone.
0:25:51|0:25:55|The cadres smiled at each other, [Shi Zhengwei] sat down, and a guard brought a document to [Headmaster].
0:26:19|0:26:31|The [Headmaster] signed on the document, picked up a piece of paper, carefully read the content on it, and handed it to [Shi Zhengwei].
0:26:38|0:26:43|The Headmaster looks serious and turns to a cadre sitting beside him.
0:26:48|0:26:51|The cadre stood up, saluted [Headmaster] and [Shi Zhengwei], then turned and left.
0:26:51|0:26:51|The scene changes, with Commander Gao and two others.
0:27:19|0:27:23|Commander Gao puts away his pen.
0:27:23|0:27:27|The messenger walks into the room.
0:27:27|0:27:34|The three turned around, and as the scene changed, the soldiers picked up their belongings and gathered in the same direction.
0:27:34|0:27:39|Commander Gao and the political commissar quickly walked over, intending to intercept them head-on.
0:27:47|0:27:55|The three of them went their separate ways, and the scene shifted to heavy troops guarding the Kuomintang stronghold.
0:27:55|0:28:0|The room is luxuriously decorated, with officers sitting around the table dining.
0:28:0|0:28:3|Some people are walking around in the room, while the officers at the table are discussing military affairs.
0:28:3|0:28:9|Commander Zhang tapped the salt shaker and stood up.
0:28:38|0:28:44|Taocun is the gateway to Shandong, the outpost in front of Yimeng Mountain. [Captain Li] scanned the crowd, looking at the officer smoking on the side, and slowly stood up.
0:29:10|0:29:13|General Zhang said.
0:29:40|0:29:40|Captain Liu replied.
0:30:12|0:30:14|Commander Zhang stood up impulsively.
0:30:14|0:30:17|The two officers below exchanged a glance and shook their heads gently.
0:30:39|0:30:44|[Commander Li] showed a look of anger and helplessness, and sighed.
0:30:46|0:30:47|[Headmaster] looked around at everyone.
0:30:58|0:31:2|General Zhang stared intently at the speaking [Headmaster].
0:31:10|0:31:15|The [Headmaster] turned around and walked towards the strategic map at the back, pointing at the map as he spoke.
0:31:33|0:31:41|The instructor put down the paper pointer in his hand and walked back to the table, looking at the officer beside him.
0:31:58|0:31:59|The Headmaster sits back in his seat.
0:32:0|0:32:17|Beside him, Commander Zhang watched as Commander Li scratched his head and sighed. Commander Zhang sneered.
0:32:17|0:32:24|The general tapped the plate, read through the document delivered by the messenger, furrowed his brow, and set it aside.
0:32:56|0:32:57|Colonel Li also stood up.
0:32:57|0:32:58|The General stood up holding a document.
0:33:46|0:33:52|The scene shifts, and the officers walk down the spiral staircase outside the banquet hall.
0:33:52|0:33:54|General Zhang and General Li are talking.
0:33:54|0:33:55|General Zhang spoke first.
0:34:11|0:34:20|The two saluted each other and shook hands before parting ways. Captain Li turned and got into the small sedan, followed by the security guard. The car then slowly drove away.
0:34:23|0:34:32|The scene shifts, two Kuomintang soldiers are rapidly operating the handles of a cannon, raising the barrel. A row of tanks fires shells, filling the battlefield with smoke.
0:34:32|0:34:37|A large number of Kuomintang soldiers ran across the river bank, charging towards the defensive attack of the People's Liberation Army.
0:34:37|0:34:43|Three PLA soldiers lie behind cover, reloading the bullets in their gun chambers.
0:34:43|0:34:48|More Nationalist soldiers waded through the water under the artillery fire.
0:34:48|0:34:52|The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are fiercely shooting from behind cover, hitting the enemies charging ahead.
0:34:53|0:34:58|Nationalist shells also fell behind the People's Liberation Army's cover, stirring up a sky full of sand and dust.
0:35:4|0:35:19|A high-ranking soldier of the People's Liberation Army, holding a machine gun, fiercely firing, leading the charge as the Nationalist soldiers in front fall one after another. Soldiers behind them take over and charge forward. Commander Gao throws grenades forward, with bullets and grenades hitting the Nationalist soldiers, causing more of them to fall on the river bank.
0:35:19|0:35:30|Captain Liu, the machine gunner, aimed the machine gun and kept firing, hitting the enemy soldiers charging ahead. The troops behind quickly caught up, bullets creating splashes in front of the enemy, causing more Nationalist soldiers to fall.
0:35:33|0:35:36|Commander Gao is observing the situation ahead.
0:35:38|0:35:42|The guard answers the phone.
0:36:9|0:36:12|Commander Gao rolled up his sleeves to check the time.
0:36:25|0:36:31|[Commander Gao] hung up the phone, turned around, picked up the binoculars and started observing the front line where the artillery fire was raging.
0:36:35|0:36:43|The instructor turned and left, the scene changed, and above the smoke-filled village, four big characters appeared five days later.
0:36:43|0:36:48|Among several villagers carrying burdens, [Zhao Yumin] is helping a wounded soldier to walk slowly.
0:36:48|0:36:54|A soldier with a rifle approached, [Zhao Yumin] carefully handed over the wounded soldier to him, and then stood in place, touching his head and wiping the sweat off.
0:36:58|0:37:2|[Zhao Yumin] caught up and the scene shifted, with many villagers carrying stretchers.
0:37:2|0:37:5|Zhao Yumin helps secure the injured soldier on one of the stretchers.
0:37:5|0:37:9|Villagers carried a stretcher and continued to move forward along the road.
0:37:9|0:37:13|The villager pushing a cart and carrying a shoulder pole walks in the middle of the road, transporting supplies.
0:37:13|0:37:16|The Headmaster and Captain Liu walked with the guards following behind.
0:37:23|0:37:25|The two men and [Commander Gao] advance into the military forest.
0:37:31|0:37:40|The sound of gunfire rang out, and the three of them looked towards the direction of the front line. The Mayor led the other two towards the observation post under the cover of the thatched shed.
0:37:40|0:37:44|The mayor lowered his head to look at his watch, then looked up at [Commander Gao].
0:38:10|0:38:13|Commander Gao gave a bitter smile.
0:39:6|0:39:9|The mayor smiled, and [Captain Liu] stepped forward.
0:39:15|0:39:16|Commander Gao said.
0:39:26|0:39:35|[Captain Liu] turned his head solemnly and looked towards the front line, where the Nationalist troops, under the cover of tanks, crossed the river bank and rushed towards the People's Liberation Army's offensive.
0:39:35|0:39:45|The gravel ground is filled with smoke, with occasional shells landing and kicking up dust. More Nationalist soldiers are charging towards the People's Liberation Army behind several tanks.
0:39:49|0:39:52|In the trenches of the People's Liberation Army, soldiers are holding the frontline.
0:39:52|0:39:58|Captain Liu frowned and aimed the machine gun, with bullets landing on the trench in front of another soldier.
0:39:58|0:40:0|He remained calm and continued shooting.
0:40:0|0:40:8|Commander Gao ran to Captain Liu's side and crouched down to observe the front line.
0:40:8|0:40:14|In the midst of the raging battlefield, amidst the flames and bombardment, the Nationalist tank continued to advance.
0:40:14|0:40:16|They fired shells while crossing over the hill.
0:40:17|0:40:24|Kuomintang soldiers launched an assault under the cover of tanks.
0:40:24|0:40:30|Commander Gao observed the front with a serious expression as the tank continued to advance at full speed.
0:40:30|0:40:37|Captain Liu started to fiercely sweep the opposite side with a machine gun, bullets flying out of the muzzle non-stop, gunpowder filling the air.
0:40:37|0:40:43|The machine gun rattled fiercely, soldiers stared intently ahead, and many Nationalist soldiers fell heavily under the fire.
0:40:45|0:40:50|PLA soldiers lay behind cover, pulling the triggers, causing more enemy soldiers to fall to the ground.
0:40:52|0:41:0|Behind the PLA sniper, several soldiers vigorously threw grenades, which exploded and sent a large number of enemy soldiers flying.
0:41:0|0:41:5|The artillery fire from the People's Liberation Army shows no sign of weakening, and Li Jin also throws a hand grenade.
0:41:5|0:41:15|A PLA soldier saw the tank forcefully pull the lever, causing landmines to explode around the tank, blocking its advance. Nationalist soldiers behind continued to cross the trench and charge forward.
0:41:15|0:41:20|The machine guns of the People's Liberation Army continued to spew bullets, as many enemies charging ahead raised their guns to counterattack.
0:41:23|0:41:31|The machine gunner of the People's Liberation Army was wounded and replaced by a soldier next to him, who quickly took over his position and looked towards [Lieutenant Zhang].
0:41:31|0:41:38|The soldiers immediately opened fire and were only a narrow trench away from the enemy. [Captain Zhang] vigorously threw a grenade and waved his hand forward.
0:41:40|0:41:43|The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are high-spirited, jumping out of cover and charging towards the enemy.
0:41:43|0:41:51|A soldier stood up, looked around from the cover, and saw soldiers rushing down the hill, running across the trenches, bravely and fearlessly charging towards the enemy.
0:41:51|0:42:0|The enemy, caught off guard, retreated backwards, gradually disintegrating.
0:42:0|0:42:4|Captain Zhang looked at [Commander Gao] through the machine gun in the middle.
0:42:7|0:42:11|Captain Zhang looked surprised, angrily clenched his fist and turned his head away, then replied.
0:43:6|0:43:7|Commander Gao turns around.
0:43:7|0:43:8|Commander Gao takes the gun.
0:43:8|0:43:11|[Zhao Yumin] happily took the gun and looked down at it.
0:43:39|0:43:49|The scene switches to a long line of PLA soldiers, each carrying a gun, walking one after another on the road out of the evacuated village.
0:43:49|0:43:55|The villagers stood by, reluctant to look at them.
0:43:55|0:44:1|Zhao Yumin, seeing the situation, quickly walked up and stood on a small mound, addressing everyone.
0:44:19|0:44:25|Commander Gao and Zhao Yumin are standing together.
0:44:25|0:44:29|[Zhao Yumin] looked up at [Commander Gao] and touched his arm.
0:44:34|0:44:43|Commander Gao turned and left with the guards, while Zhao Yumin stood in place, looking in the direction they left with a sinister anticipation in her eyes.
0:44:43|0:45:1|Captain Liu walked up to his wife, took one last look at her, then turned around to join the team. Yonggui also turned and left.
0:45:2|0:45:9|A group of villagers bid farewell to the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army with guns in hand, and the two groups departed in different directions.
0:45:9|0:45:19|The villagers walked up the mountain path, while the PLA troops gradually moved away along the central road, the two groups bid farewell to each other with reluctance, waving their hands.
0:45:19|0:45:23|Carry out your respective tasks and wait to meet again.
0:45:23|0:45:27|The scene switches to the war-torn land with craters and devastation left from the battle between the two armies.
0:45:29|0:45:33|The trees in the forest stretched out their delicate branches.
0:45:33|0:45:36|The sky was desolate and deserted, silent and still.
0:45:36|0:45:42|Remaining Nationalist soldiers raised their cannons and fired at the enemy across the way.
0:45:42|0:45:48|Shells were fired, continuously landing behind the previous positions of the People's Liberation Army, stirring up large clouds of dust.
0:45:48|0:45:54|The Nationalist army cautiously crossed the river, rifles in hand, and landed in Taocun on the other side.
0:45:55|0:46:7|The soldier running ahead stood at the entrance of the fleeing village, holding a gun and looking around to observe the situation of the village.
0:46:7|0:46:19|They split into teams and entered the alley to search. A group of soldiers, led by [Headmaster], crouched and approached a house, with the first soldier kicking open the door and firing into the house.
0:46:19|0:46:29|A military vehicle drove to the entrance of the village and stopped. Two Kuomintang officers got out of the car, and the guard ran to the front of the car, with all the soldiers standing at attention.
0:46:29|0:46:36|A soldier ran up to the car and saluted two officers.
0:46:36|0:46:39|The soldiers ran away with their leader.
0:46:39|0:46:43|[Zhao Yumin] took two steps forward with the chief of staff, then stood still.
0:46:43|0:46:49|He saw eight big characters on the wall across from him that read "Our army will win, Jiang's army will lose."
0:46:56|0:47:6|The scene shifts to Nationalist soldiers looting supplies. One soldier finds nothing and is mocked by his comrades. Angered, he kicks a piece of wood, picks up his gun, and leaves.
0:47:6|0:47:17|A soldier ran up to two officers, handing a document to [Headmaster]. [Headmaster] nodded silently and the soldier ran off.
0:47:17|0:47:22|The Chief of Staff opened the file and then turned to Commander Zhang.
0:47:30|0:47:42|[Commander Zhang] was startled, his brows furrowed tightly. His eyes were in a panic, he lowered his head, then slapped his thigh, pacing back and forth in front of the car anxiously with his hands behind his back.
0:47:42|0:47:50|The scene changes, with continuous mountains and lush trees. The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are lined up, walking across a rocky beach.
0:47:50|0:47:56|Some of them carried firearms on their backs, some carried tightly packed luggage, one after another climbing up the mountain.
0:47:59|0:48:1|Chinese subtitles volunteer [Li Zongsheng]
0:48:3|0:48:7|[Li Jin] wiped the sweat off and caught up with the team ahead.
0:48:7|0:48:12|[Captain Liu] followed behind him with a gun on his back, and the soldiers were panting one after another as they hurried along.
0:48:12|0:48:17|A young soldier struggles to climb up the hill, running out of energy, bending over to support his knees.
0:48:17|0:48:22|His comrades came up behind him, took the gun off his back, and helped lighten his load.
0:48:22|0:48:27|The young soldier regained his spirits, caught up with the team, and continued climbing the mountain with determination.
0:48:27|0:48:31|The mountain road was rugged, but it did not slow down the rapid movement of the People's Liberation Army troops.
0:48:32|0:48:42|The scene shifts, with strong winds and pouring rain, yet the troops continue to march forward resolutely, their backs straight and determined to move ahead.
0:48:42|0:48:52|The troops passed through a riverbank with rapid water flow, splashing mud and water everywhere, but no one paid attention to their soaked shoes.
0:48:52|0:49:4|Despite the uneven ground beneath their feet and their soaked clothing, despite traveling day and night and feeling physically exhausted, the soldiers still maintained a determined look in their eyes and kept the formation orderly.
0:49:4|0:49:12|[Li Jin] carried a gun, raindrops hitting his face.
0:49:12|0:49:21|Commander Gao braved the wind and rain with the soldiers, moving forward together.
0:49:21|0:49:26|The scene changes, a Kuomintang military truck drives through the soldiers honking its horn.
0:49:26|0:49:28|The soldiers surrounded from behind one after another.
0:49:30|0:49:45|Inside a house in Taocun, smoke filled the air. Several Kuomintang officers were smoking, two were looking at a map, one was pacing back and forth, and two were chatting by a pillar.
0:50:17|0:50:28|The officer on the side shook his head, [Headmaster] walked into the room, stood in front of the table looking at the map, and several officers gathered around, [Headmaster] looked at them.
0:50:30|0:50:33|Several officers looked at each other and slowly turned away.
0:50:33|0:50:43|The sound of a telegram came through, and [Headmaster] looked towards the other side of the room.
0:50:43|0:50:47|In the next room, two telegraph operators are sending telegrams.
0:50:47|0:50:55|Captain Liu paced nervously as Headmaster entered the room. With a solemn expression, he shook his head and spoke.
0:51:8|0:51:13|Captain Liu furrowed his brow, slowly turned around, and walked away quickly.
0:51:13|0:51:15|The Headmaster lowers his head.
0:51:20|0:51:48|Zhang [Headmaster] half-lying on the chair, a bottle of red wine on the table beside him, his hands clasped in front of his chest, lifting his face to take a deep breath. The Chief of Staff, holding a cigarette, walks up to him.
0:51:48|0:51:52|The Chief of Staff lit a cigarette.
0:51:52|0:51:56|Zhang [Headmaster] stood up abruptly, walked to the telegraph operator, and took the telegram.
0:51:56|0:51:57|The two of them began to read.
0:52:6|0:52:15|Zhang [Headmaster] showed a shocked expression, then quickly walked out of the room and went to the table in the next room, looking at the map.
0:52:15|0:52:21|He used his fingers to draw a winding line on the map from Taocun to Fenghuang Mountain, then looked up and said.
0:52:31|0:52:37|The scene shifts to a column of PLA troops lined up on the hillside, continuing along the winding mountain road.
0:52:37|0:52:44|With a single cannon shot, Li Jin stood on a rock and looked over there.
0:52:45|0:52:52|He continued to walk with a smile, while [Commander Gao] observed the distance through binoculars.
0:52:52|0:52:55|Pointed to the map on the ground where the guard was standing, and then pointed to the distance.
0:52:55|0:52:59|Lieutenant Zhang helped a soldier up the hill and looked into the distance.
0:53:9|0:53:13|The soldier took over Captain Zhang's gun and excitedly walked up to [Commander Gao].
0:53:21|0:53:25|Lieutenant Zhang turned around and climbed up the hill, walking to an old man with a headscarf.
0:54:1|0:54:12|The platoon leader excitedly picked up the telescope, and the resting soldiers heard the number and stood up one after another, happily telling their comrades nearby.
0:54:12|0:54:26|Commander Gao looked at the map and walked up to the team that had been resting.
0:54:29|0:54:41|Commander Gao followed behind Headmaster, climbed up the hill, and looked towards the direction of the battle.
0:54:41|0:54:49|Commander Gao took the binoculars and looked through them. In the distance, several hills were constantly being bombarded, with thick smoke rising from the terraced fields on the slopes and mountainsides.
0:55:1|0:55:2|They all laughed.
0:55:27|0:55:30|Li Jin smiled and said.
0:56:6|0:56:14|Everyone laughed together, and Wang Chun suddenly stood up and pointed ahead.
0:56:14|0:56:19|Everyone stood up and looked over as a group of PLA soldiers led some captives from the Nationalist Army.
0:56:20|0:56:29|Everyone gathered around to watch, while another well-organized team of the People's Liberation Army approached from a different direction.
0:56:29|0:56:32|Everyone looked happily at the fruits of victory before them.
0:56:51|0:57:1|Li Jinsheng turned around in a sullen manner and walked towards [Captain Zhang].
0:57:1|0:57:8|Lieutenant Zhang walked away.
0:57:8|0:57:13|Everyone looked at the back of [Captain Zhang] and started to laugh.
0:57:13|0:57:17|On the side of the main road, the artillery unit returning from the fort is using vehicles to transport supplies.
0:57:20|0:57:25|A soldier walked to the roadside to borrow a lighter, looked up and saw [Zhao Yumin] and others.
0:57:49|0:57:55|He ran ahead of the advancing team, while the infantry unit marched neatly behind.
0:57:55|0:57:59|The scene cuts to the command post, where [Headmaster] is attentively listening to the phone.
0:58:1|0:58:4|The Headmaster glanced at his watch and continued speaking.
0:58:10|0:58:14|The Headmaster put down the receiver and walked towards the Discipline Inspection Committee of the division.
0:58:39|0:58:41|They both look at their watches at the same time.
0:58:54|0:59:12|The headmaster signed the documents, while a battalion and a company were resting in the woods. Captain Zhang sat on a rock, frowning and smoking, as everyone got up and ran towards the commander. Commander Gao dismounted and walked over.
0:59:32|0:59:36|Commander Gao squats down and spreads out the map.
0:59:36|0:59:44|The enemy reinforcements in the south are now approaching Motian Ridge to support the enemy at Phoenix Mountain. Everyone stood up one after another.
1:0:13|1:0:23|Both sides saluted each other, with Zhang Ling leading his men away. Excitedly, Li Jin and others who were listening by the tree turned around and ran off. The soldiers finished their rest, packed up their belongings, and prepared to set off again.
1:0:23|1:0:33|The scene switches to the Nationalist Army, with infantry walking on both sides and military vehicles driving in the middle.
1:0:33|1:0:38|General Zhang and Chief of Staff sat in the car, their expressions serious. General Zhang glanced at his watch.
1:1:0|1:1:5|General Zhang crossed his arms, leaned back in the back seat, and furrowed his brow.
1:1:11|1:1:12|Zhang [Headmaster] looked disdainful.
1:1:12|1:1:15|The Chief of Staff patted the driver's shoulder, and the driver released the handbrake.
1:1:40|1:1:48|The scene shifts, with rugged mountains stretching far and wide.
1:1:48|1:1:52|White clouds billowed on the peaks of the strange rock forest.
1:1:52|1:1:57|The People's Liberation Army troops marched mightily on the steep mountain slope.
1:1:57|1:2:2|The soldiers quickly climbed up, forming a long black dragon along the edge of the hillside.
1:2:2|1:2:4|The soldiers worked together, racing against each other.
1:2:5|1:2:11|On the other side of the mountain peak, the Nationalist army is also climbing towards the mountaintop with their guns.
1:2:11|1:2:21|The soldiers dragged their steps, some fell down due to exhaustion, while on the other side shrouded in mist, the PLA soldiers were high-spirited.
1:2:21|1:2:26|Everyone quickly made their way through the scattered rocks, scrambling to reach the mountaintop.
1:2:26|1:2:31|The soldier in front reaches out to grab the person behind, helping each other climb.
1:2:31|1:2:37|A soldier struggled to climb up, grabbing onto the rocks above with both hands, but he fell backwards due to unstable footing.
1:2:37|1:2:41|He struggled to stand up, and the soldiers behind him also helped him.
1:2:41|1:2:46|Continuing to climb upwards, on the other side, the Nationalist soldiers were climbing unsteadily.
1:2:58|1:3:4|On the other side, the PLA troops persist in climbing and are about to reach the mountaintop soon.
1:3:4|1:3:10|Li Jin struggled to climb up a small slope, looked up, gritted his teeth, and continued upwards.
1:3:10|1:3:15|The Nationalist soldier was struggling to climb up.
1:3:15|1:3:21|Captain Zhang waved his hand behind him, and the soldiers behind him quickened their pace to cross over the hill.
1:3:21|1:3:32|Nationalist soldiers quickened their pace, while the PLA soldiers rushed down the hill, crouching behind cover with their guns pointed directly at the Nationalist soldiers.
1:3:32|1:3:38|Nationalist soldiers are still climbing, while the machine gunner has already set up the machine gun at the gap.
1:3:38|1:3:43|[Captain Liu] reloads the gun, while Li Jin checks the hand grenade in his hand.
1:3:43|1:3:51|Nationalist soldiers climbed the mountain while shooting upwards, the sound of gunfire filled the air, and the mountain top was shrouded in smoke. [Captain Zhang] looked down below.
1:3:52|1:3:58|The soldiers behind cover opened fire one after another, with bullets continuously shooting out from the muzzles.
1:3:58|1:4:6|The mountaintop was shrouded in thick smoke of gunpowder.
1:4:6|1:4:10|Commander Zhang, in charge of the Nationalist army's operations, looked out from the mountaintop with a solemn expression.
1:4:53|1:4:58|[General Zhang] took the microphone and a soldier ran over quickly.
1:4:58|1:5:3|He opened the file, handed a piece of paper to the Chief of Staff, and then ran away.
1:5:3|1:5:5|The Chief of Staff looked at his watch, his expression grave.
1:5:5|1:5:5|He walked up to Commander Zhang.
1:5:20|1:5:23|[Commander Zhang] glanced at his watch, it was already 4:34, he snatched the paper and tore it off.
1:5:23|1:5:25|Zhang [Headmaster] continued to observe the battle with binoculars, while the PLA troops were building defensive fortifications on the mountain.
1:5:43|1:5:51|Lieutenant Zhang pointed in a direction for two soldiers, who then hurried to repair the front bunker with chisels and shovels.
1:5:51|1:6:3|Li Jin and the other two sat on the slope, wiping their guns anxiously as they looked into the distance.
1:6:3|1:6:8|Commander Gao took down the binoculars in front of him, looked back for a moment, and then continued to observe.
1:6:20|1:6:27|Captain Zhang raised the brim of his hat, hands on his hips, anxiously waiting.
1:6:27|1:6:40|Commander Gao looked back, then down at his watch. It was already four fifty-eight. The soldiers were leaning on their guns, about to fall asleep. Suddenly, the sound of cannons rang out. Everyone excitedly stood up and looked towards the direction.
1:6:44|1:6:58|On the screen, the words "The final attack on Phoenix Mountain begins" appear, team members fire the cannons, countless shells fly towards the opposite hillside, causing dust to fly.
1:6:58|1:7:7|The cannons continue to fire, knocking down the enemy's barriers. Shells keep falling on the hillside, with smoke and dust filling the battlefield.
1:7:28|1:7:36|The artillerymen keep firing, blowing up an enemy bunker.
1:7:36|1:7:45|At this moment, several soldiers hiding in the trench attached bayonets to the muzzles of their guns, waiting for orders, and then charged out together.
1:7:45|1:7:50|Hundreds of soldiers are running on the undulating terrain with grand momentum.
1:7:57|1:8:2|On the other side, the artillerymen are still continuously firing, with two artillerymen operating each gun.
1:8:11|1:8:17|The bugle sounded, and the soldiers charged forward, quickly running towards the hillside still shrouded in billowing smoke.
1:8:29|1:8:46|The enemies were hiding in the trenches, shooting at the soldiers below the mountain, but they couldn't withstand the powerful firepower of the cannons and the brave charge of the soldiers, so they turned around and started to run away.
1:8:46|1:8:52|A soldier, unable to escape, simply squats in the trench with his hands raised, indicating surrender.
1:8:52|1:8:56|The army has been defeated and the defense line of one division has been completely breached.
1:9:19|1:9:25|[Zhao Yumin] and others were talking when a shell suddenly landed in the direction behind them, blowing a gap in the hill.
1:9:32|1:9:36|Soldiers in the trenches are raising their weapons, preparing for battle.
1:9:36|1:9:42|The enemy's counterattack was fierce, with shells landing on the hillside, raising a cloud of smoke that obscured the view.
1:9:57|1:10:10|The enemy assault team climbed up from the bottom of the mountain and were shot down by the soldiers on the top of the mountain, with several of them falling.
1:10:10|1:10:19|Captain Zhang waved his hand vigorously, and the soldiers who were originally lying on the mountaintop stood up one after another, ran to the halfway point of the mountain, and fiercely fired at the enemy charging towards them from behind the cover.
1:10:38|1:10:54|After speaking, he continued to shoot at the enemy, and the machine gunner beside him kept firing as well. At that moment, a soldier behind cover was hit by a bullet and fell to the ground. The medic quickly ran forward to treat him, while more and more enemy soldiers fell under the intense machine gun fire.
1:11:3|1:11:16|The soldier next to him hid behind cover, quickly picking up hand grenades in front of him, pulling the pins, and throwing them at the enemy. 
1:11:16|1:11:21|Finally, the enemy, under the cover of smoke and gunfire, killed two soldiers and broke through a gap.
1:11:21|1:11:25|And nearby soldiers quickly opened fire with their rifles, knocking down the enemy troops.
1:11:25|1:11:29|Some soldiers used the butt of their rifles to fiercely strike the enemy, engaging in hand-to-hand combat with them.
1:11:30|1:11:37|A soldier quickly ran over to support, and the oncoming enemy troops were all killed.
1:11:37|1:11:49|The [PLA soldier] regained control of the front line.
1:11:49|1:11:52|On the other side, the Nationalist officers communicate with the frontline soldiers via radio.
1:12:13|1:12:22|At this moment, the charging soldiers of the People's Liberation Army have crossed over the hill and are running towards the smoking village not far away.
1:12:22|1:12:23|The soldiers advanced in an orderly and fast manner.
1:12:30|1:12:36|In the village, the soldiers of the Kuomintang are still resisting.
1:12:36|1:12:42|At the village entrance, a PLA soldier charging with explosives is hit by bullets and falls straight to the ground.
1:12:42|1:12:48|The comrades behind quickly ran forward, picked up the explosives on the ground, and ran towards the village.
1:12:48|1:12:56|Several soldiers of the Nationalist Army hurriedly fled.
1:12:56|1:12:57|Suddenly, the explosives exploded.
1:12:58|1:13:2|The soldier sacrificed his own life for the breakthrough of his comrades.
1:13:2|1:13:5|The soldiers at the village entrance rushed into the house.
1:13:5|1:13:23|In a room, the Nationalist soldiers received a radio signal.
1:13:23|1:13:26|As soon as the officer finished speaking, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army rushed in from outside.
1:13:37|1:13:41|The officers in the rear heard about the situation in the village and looked serious.
1:13:41|1:13:52|At this moment, the PLA soldiers behind cover are still firing with machine guns, while the Nationalist army on the hillside has been routed and is starting to flee downhill.
1:13:52|1:13:55|Li Jin fired several shots with his rifle, happily adjusting his hat.
1:14:5|1:14:8|[Commander Gao] quickly walked down the hill holding a telegram.
1:14:8|1:14:12|The enemies on Phoenix Mountain have all been dealt with.
1:14:12|1:14:16|Captain Zhang shook open the telegram and read the message.
1:14:20|1:14:27|The crowd cheered and celebrated, one after another passing through the telegram that read "victory".
1:14:27|1:14:30|The soldiers at the frontline of the bunker celebrate their victory.
1:14:30|1:14:33|A soldier ran over with a telegram, and everyone quickly gathered around.
1:14:45|1:14:51|Zhang [Headmaster] read the telegram with a smile, suddenly he thought of something and turned to [Commander Gao].
1:15:12|1:15:16|The soldiers behind were laughing and eagerly reading the telegram.
1:15:16|1:15:31|[Commander Gao] walked past the soldiers with a smile. As he walked downhill, he stood behind a soldier dancing. The soldier turned around shyly and covered his mouth, [Captain Liu] patted his back, and continued walking with a smile.
1:15:31|1:15:32|Commander Gao went to answer the phone.
1:16:38|1:16:46|The officers all stood up, and Headmaster Zhang abruptly turned to look at the map on the table.
1:16:51|1:16:56|The Communist army has always had the characteristic of continuous combat, and their speed of movement is quite astonishing.
1:16:58|1:17:5|Zhang [Headmaster] remained silent for a moment.
1:17:5|1:17:18|The Headmaster pondered for a moment, then turned around and walked away.
1:17:18|1:17:24|The Chief of Staff continued to observe the map, holding a pen in his hand, with a pensive expression on his face.
1:17:24|1:17:26|He slowly takes the cloth, his eyes quickly spinning.
1:17:29|1:17:33|Suddenly he remembered something and turned to [Commander Zhang].
1:17:56|1:17:57|Now the main force of the Communist army.
1:18:7|1:18:13|[Commander Zhang] snorted, turned and left, while the chief of staff remained lost in thought.
1:18:13|1:18:19|The scene shifts, with the [Headmaster] and a group of soldiers riding horses on a mountain path, approaching [Commander Gao] and others.
1:18:37|1:18:41|The [Headmaster] turned around, took the binoculars, and followed [Commander Gao].
1:18:41|1:18:46|Accompanied by [Commander Gao], he climbed to a high place, raised the binoculars, and looked into the distance.
1:18:46|1:18:47|He then put down the binoculars and said.
1:19:31|1:19:37|The two turned to look at the soldiers in the platoon, who quickly stood up. [Shi Zhengwei] walked over and stood in front of everyone.
1:19:37|1:19:41|Everyone sat relaxed by the roadside, with [Shi Zhengwei] sitting among the soldiers, looking them over.
1:19:54|1:19:55|Everyone started to laugh.
1:20:23|1:20:26|Li Jing and other soldiers were laughing happily on the side.
1:20:28|1:20:32|[Li Jing] glanced at Wang Chun across from her, then looked back at [Liu Yonggui].
1:21:25|1:21:26|Li Jin stood up all of a sudden.
1:21:49|1:22:1|The scene shifts to inside the Kuomintang's tent, where a telegraph operator is sending a telegram under dim lighting.
1:22:1|1:22:5|A military officer sat on a chair next to him, leaning his head against his hand with a dejected look.
1:22:9|1:22:18|[Zhao Yumin] sat at another table, keeping her head down in silence.
1:22:18|1:22:23|The Headmaster walked towards Zhao Yumin with a telegram in hand.
1:22:23|1:22:29|Several officers gathered around, [Zhao Yumin] quickly took the telegram and read it carefully line by line with a frown on his face.
1:22:37|1:22:39|[Zhao Yumin] put down the telegram, stood up, buttoned up the shirt collar, stood to the side, and buttoned up the buttons of the coat one by one.
1:22:39|1:22:41|General Zhang wrapped a scarf around himself, and the guard brought a big coat for him to put on the outside.
1:22:41|1:22:41|The guard turned and walked out of the tent.
1:23:6|1:23:15|General Zhang straightened his uniform, turned around, and put on his military cap.
1:23:15|1:23:20|The commander had a fierce look in his eyes and put on gloves.
1:23:20|1:23:27|The scene cuts to shells continuously falling on the slope of Phoenix Mountain, kicking up clouds of dust.
1:23:27|1:23:31|[Headmaster], [Commander Gao], and [Captain Liu] are sitting in the bunker discussing the battle plan, when the captain stands up at the sound of something.
1:23:33|1:23:55|[Shi Zhengwei] also stood up and looked towards the direction where the shells were being fired. The three of them looked up to observe their surroundings. The enemy shells were falling randomly on the surrounding hills, and the sound of the cannons echoed among the mountains. [Shi Zhengwei] turned to look at [Headmaster]. [Headmaster] turned around, with a look of confusion on his face, and then looked up at the sky.
1:24:0|1:24:13|The three turned and walked away. The scene shifted to a military truck carrying many Nationalist soldiers wearing steel helmets retreating. Some soldiers took the opportunity to climb onto the truck, causing chaos and noise on the vehicle.
1:24:13|1:24:27|Infantrymen stumbled along behind the truck with their guns, while a few soldiers filled ammunition by the cannon. The cannon fired, emitting thick smoke from the barrel. Several soldiers then hoisted the cannon and hung it at the back of the truck. The driver glanced back and started the vehicle.
1:24:30|1:24:42|Several soldiers climbed onto the side of the truck, which was moving slowly. Some soldiers sat on the barrel dragged by the truck, while others rode donkeys, pulled oxen ropes, or carried wounded soldiers following behind.
1:24:42|1:24:58|Seeing the people in front climbing onto the truck one after another, the soldier carrying the wounded immediately placed the stretcher on the ground and struggled to squeeze onto the truck with the others. The people on the truck indiscriminately whipped down at them, while the wounded soldier on the ground struggled, but no one paid any attention to him. He stumbled and fell, facing the direction the truck was driving away, helplessly lying in the middle of the road.
1:25:7|1:25:15|The scene shifts, sunlight shining through the cracks in the clouds onto the mountains. [Li Jin] walks to the edge of the trench and looks down, [Liu Yonggui] approaches him and also looks down.
1:25:15|1:25:15|The two looked at each other, the scene switched, and [Headmaster] was on the phone.
1:25:15|1:25:15|The Headmaster hangs up the phone.
1:25:15|1:25:16|The Headmaster and Shi Zhengwei turned and left.
1:25:36|1:25:37|Commander Gao leads the group towards the Headmaster.
1:25:55|1:26:12|The scene shifts to the mainland, where the wheels of the Kuomintang's trucks kick up a large amount of dust on the dirt road. The convoy carries soldiers and equipment as it travels downhill, while infantry soldiers march uphill carrying firearms.
1:26:12|1:26:20|In the car, [Commander Zhang] pressed his hand against his forehead, the chief of staff frowned and smoked, with white smoke coming out of his mouth and nose, he turned to the commander.
1:26:26|1:26:31|General Zhang did not answer immediately. He slowly put down his hand supporting his forehead and let out a sigh.
1:26:31|1:26:36|On other battlefields across the country, our army also suffered great losses.
1:27:1|1:27:6|Headmaster Zhang's brow remained furrowed as he looked ahead at the advancing troops.
1:27:6|1:27:10|Commander Gao let out a deep sigh and looked out the window.
1:27:22|1:27:25|The light reflected his lonely expression.
1:27:25|1:27:36|The scene switches to the continuous hills, where neatly arranged terraces are built. The mountainside is covered with dense trees, and in the distance, there is a vast expanse of blue.
1:27:36|1:27:42|The scene cuts to a massive mountain crevice.
1:27:42|1:27:51|Ermai crouched down with a young man hidden inside, observing the Nationalist Army troops marching in the distance in the ancient battlefield.
1:27:53|1:27:59|He made a gesture with his hand towards the back, and [Zhao Yumin] looked up and nodded.
1:28:8|1:28:20|[Zhao Yumin] led the villagers running down the mountain. They ran out of the valley, and another group of villagers also ran down the mountain to meet them.
1:28:20|1:28:28|The villagers ran forward, with [Zhao Yumin] holding a gun and leading the way. He then stopped to observe the surroundings and gestured for me to follow.
1:28:28|1:28:36|The villagers ran over with tools, with [Zhao Yumin] following behind the team.
1:28:36|1:28:40|The villagers began to chisel the surface of this mountain road with a chisel.
1:28:40|1:28:46|In the distance, the main force of the Nationalist Army is marching in a grand and imposing manner.
1:28:46|1:28:48|[Zhao Yumin] sprinkled some powder from her clothes onto the road.
1:28:48|1:28:54|The villagers smoothed the road surface, everyone stood up and ran towards the distance with tools in hand.
1:28:57|1:29:9|On the high ground, a villager is standing guard with a gun, and Yumin's squad runs up the high ground, with the sentry running away with them.
1:29:9|1:29:19|Beside a withered tree, the Nationalist army's transport trucks and infantry continued on their way, oblivious to the villagers' actions. The truck carrying soldiers moved forward.
1:29:21|1:29:34|At this moment, a car suddenly crashed into the one in front, causing an explosion. Villagers raised their heads from the cover to look, and the car behind had to brake urgently. Soldiers panicked and scrambled to jump off the car to take cover, some guns misfired, and bullets flew everywhere.
1:29:34|1:29:41|The Chief of Staff opened the car door and looked ahead, [Zhao Yumin] and the villagers behind her all smiled.
1:29:41|1:29:45|The scene switches, the troops of the People's Liberation Army march in perfect formation on the main road.
1:29:46|1:29:54|Villagers welcomed them by the roadside, with many villagers pushing wheelbarrows and carrying goods down the mountain with shoulder poles.
1:29:54|1:30:6|Their team also marched in an orderly manner, coming from the mountains.
1:30:6|1:30:13|The People's Liberation Army is warmly welcomed by the masses, with [Zhao Yumin] standing with several children, one of whom is touching the weapon in his hand.
1:30:20|1:30:25|Li Jin turned around and left, he jumped down a hillside and ran to join the team.
1:30:25|1:30:30|The team is heading towards the village to escape.
1:30:30|1:30:35|The scene changes to a row of horses resting, swatting away insects with their tails.
1:30:35|1:30:41|On the hillside is a grove of trees, where several soldiers are standing guard.
1:30:41|1:30:43|The enemy is retreating towards the south of Dashaho.
1:31:33|1:31:34|[Shi Zhengwei] stands up.
1:31:48|1:31:49|Captain Liu turned to Commander Gao.

1:32:10|1:32:19|The cadres stood up and left one by one, the scene switched. The People's Liberation Army troops, carrying guns and backpacks, marched into the distance with horses carrying supplies.
1:32:19|1:32:32|The soldiers behind ran to catch up, while two soldiers on fast horses turned into a side road and galloped up the slope to catch up with the leading troops.
1:32:32|1:32:33|The scene shifts to the Nationalist Army troops.
1:32:34|1:32:50|Two military vehicles are driving in the middle of the road, surrounded by soldiers who look listless and dejected, dragging their feet as they move forward.
1:32:50|1:32:57|Soldiers in a vehicle stopped by the river and jumped out of the car.
1:32:57|1:33:1|General Zhang and Chief of Staff walked by, with soldiers following behind them carrying guns.
1:33:47|1:33:49|Captain Liu frowned.
1:33:57|1:33:58|Captain Liu's eyes lit up.
1:34:18|1:34:33|The scene shifts to the river in the distance, the water surface shimmering under the sunlight, the river flowing rapidly, carrying mud and eroding the riverbank.
1:34:33|1:34:39|The scene cuts to [Commander Gao] walking up to two sentries, placing one foot on the mound.
1:34:42|1:34:48|The Nationalist Army is seen digging the river bank on the opposite side, as Commander Gao points at the soldiers on the other side.
1:34:48|1:34:53|Several soldiers turned and ran towards the resting soldiers, who all stood up, picked up their weapons, and ran towards the riverbank in formation.
1:35:11|1:35:15|Captain Liu placed the machine gun by the river, supported his body with both hands, and bent down to drink water from the river.
1:35:17|1:35:20|After taking a few sips, he shook his hand and stood up straight.
1:35:22|1:35:25|He wiped his mouth with his sleeve and picked up the machine gun, then walked away.
1:35:25|1:35:29|Two soldiers squatting down are rolling up their pant legs.
1:35:29|1:35:31|Li Jin pointed forward, and the two stood up and left.
1:35:31|1:35:34|Li Jin turned to Captain Liu Yonggui.
1:35:34|1:35:38|The troops carefully crossed the river, with soldiers wading through the water while observing the opposite bank.
1:35:38|1:35:39|The water flowed swiftly, shimmering in the sunlight.
1:35:46|1:35:54|The scene shifts, a truck from the Nationalist Army drives down the distant road.
1:35:54|1:35:56|It stopped in the middle of the road.
1:35:56|1:36:7|Several soldiers by the river gathered around the car, unloading one sealed wooden crate after another.
1:36:7|1:36:14|The scene cuts back to the People's Liberation Army troops, who are crossing the river and coming ashore quickly and cautiously.
1:36:14|1:36:15|Commander Gao stands in the formation.
1:36:17|1:36:23|The troops ran towards the woods, with Commander Gao following closely behind.
1:36:23|1:36:39|The scene changes, with the river water carrying mud flowing continuously. In a trench on the river bank, explosives are piled up, and two Nationalist soldiers are pulling the fuse while retreating.
1:36:39|1:36:42|[Zhao Yumin] observed their actions from the side, frowning with a serious expression.
1:36:47|1:36:50|The truck carrying explosives drove away, and [Zhao Yumin] stood up with a gun.
1:36:50|1:36:51|[Zhao Yumin] waved his hand back, and some of the guerrilla fighters stood up and ran away with him.
1:36:51|1:36:52|They turned around a stone embankment, and [Zhao Yumin] led the team members to run forward along the gravel beach.
1:37:18|1:37:24|[Zhao Yumin] used both hands and feet to climb up a narrow staircase.
1:37:24|1:37:31|The team members crouched down and followed him cautiously.

1:37:39|1:37:47|General Zhang is drinking from a tall glass inside the room. The Chief of Staff enters from outside, closes the door, and walks up to General Zhang, bending down beside him.
1:37:49|1:37:58|Commander Gao raised his head and pondered for a moment, then suddenly stood up.
1:37:58|1:38:3|The sound of artillery suddenly rang outside the window, and the two quickly turned their heads and walked to the window.
1:38:3|1:38:10|The commander pushed open the window and looked outside. Amidst the intense gunfire, the soldiers of the Unsealed Army quickly moved forward with their weapons.
1:38:10|1:38:15|They crouched behind cover, raising their guns to launch an attack across the way.
1:38:15|1:38:18|Some soldiers crouched and ran forward from the cover.
1:38:19|1:38:29|Thick smoke billowed ahead, accompanied by the sound of gunfire.
1:38:29|1:38:38|A group of soldiers ran into the smoke, skillfully dodging the obstacles on the ground, and continued running forward.
1:38:38|1:38:44|The soldiers lying on the railway saw Commander Gao's gesture, and they all picked up their guns, jumped off the railway, and ran forward.
1:38:50|1:38:55|In the reconnaissance, the PLA soldiers swiftly crossed the enemy's defense and launched an attack from within.
1:38:55|1:39:0|Nationalist soldiers were caught off guard and fled in all directions.
1:39:0|1:39:6|Two Kuomintang soldiers emerged from the tunnel and were caught red-handed by the People's Liberation Army.
1:39:6|1:39:11|Captain Liu bit open the ring pull, threw the grenade, and blew down the fleeing enemies.
1:39:11|1:39:15|Several soldiers who had no way to escape turned around and counterattacked, only to be forced back by a hail of bullets.
1:39:17|1:39:25|[Li Jin] ran down a flight of stairs and shot dead an enemy.
1:39:25|1:39:35|He looked inside and saw another enemy crawling out trying to escape. Seeing him escaping, [Li Jin] caught up and set up the machine gun in the gap, aiming and shooting.
1:39:35|1:39:36|Several enemies fled through the ruins.
1:39:37|1:39:43|A soldier emerged and shot down an enemy, then fired a shot in the direction the enemy was fleeing. Everyone chased after.
1:39:43|1:39:49|Two enemies jumped into the trench, followed by PLA soldiers who jumped in and fired a shot.
1:39:49|1:39:55|Several people moved to the other side, set up their guns, aimed at the enemy outside, and started shooting.
1:39:55|1:39:58|Outside, fires are breaking out everywhere, with thick smoke billowing.
1:39:58|1:40:3|The Nationalist Army was in disarray, with soldiers and officers all scrambling to escape.
1:40:3|1:40:4|The sound of gunfire showed no sign of weakening.
1:40:12|1:40:28|Commander Gao ran over and crouched behind the cover to observe the opposite side. He turned back and signaled to the others. With a wave of his hand, a gunshot rang out. Suddenly, he kept covering his neck with his hand. Two soldiers quickly helped him to sit down on the side to assess his injury. The guard unbuttoned his collar.
1:40:28|1:40:34|Two soldiers examine the wound on Commander Gao's neck, one of them wraps the wound with white gauze, but Commander Gao turns his head away in refusal.
1:40:37|1:40:44|Commander Gao holds the wound on his neck himself.
1:40:44|1:40:50|The soldiers quickly got up and ran away, leaving [Commander Gao] leaning against the cover, catching his breath.
1:40:50|1:40:57|The scene shifts to the endless mountains, where two bright signal flares are flying towards the distance with long trails of smoke.
1:40:57|1:41:0|In the small plain surrounded by mountains, the People's Liberation Army troops are marching.
1:41:1|1:41:10|The infantry marched in formation in the center, with [Headmaster] leading a group of soldiers riding horses quickly along the side of the formation.
1:41:10|1:41:20|A soldier riding a horse comes galloping towards them, saluting with a military salute.

1:42:44|1:42:53|The scene shifts to the General's Temple Station, where soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are rebuilding the defense fortifications that were destroyed inside the station.
1:42:53|1:43:0|Lieutenant Zhang sat down, blinked his eyes, looked up, then looked down at his watch - 4:12.
1:43:0|1:43:8|[Commander Gao] emerges from a corner and watches the soldiers working.
1:43:49|1:43:56|Soldiers turned around at the sound, and shells flashed in the night sky. They lay behind cover, readying their guns.
1:44:19|1:44:21|After a wall collapsed, the airport was already exploding.
1:44:21|1:44:32|Captain Zhang and others observed in the distance as shells trailed black smoke and exploded, raising large clouds of dust.
1:44:32|1:44:37|The scene shifts to another PLA unit running forward, marching on the main road.
1:44:37|1:44:41|They hurried along, with horses carrying supplies led by soldiers, moving forward in small steps.
1:44:45|1:44:50|Some soldiers are sitting in the vehicles, while others are riding on horseback, all in neat and spirited formation.
1:44:50|1:45:3|The Headmaster and Commander Gao rode side by side on horseback, leading their troops forward with neat silhouettes left behind along the way.
1:45:3|1:45:9|The scene cuts to the guerrilla team, with [Zhao Yumin] and a team member crawling forward under the barbed wire.
1:45:9|1:45:12|[Zhao Yumin] signaled with his eyes, and the team members carefully crawled out.
1:45:13|1:45:21|He quickly moved forward while observing the situation beside him.
1:45:21|1:45:28|Ermai held a gun, his eyes fixed on him.
1:45:28|1:45:36|The team members quickly crawled towards the riverbank using their arms to support their bodies.
1:45:36|1:45:38|[Zhao Yumin] was also watching him attentively.
1:45:38|1:45:41|On a fortress, two Nationalist soldiers are on guard duty.
1:45:41|1:45:58|On the side of the bomb, a team member crawled towards it from the side of the slope. He stopped, reached into his pocket, and a young soldier saw him. He tapped his companion, and the two raised their guns. Two gunshots were heard, and the team member's body trembled, his head tilted, and he stopped moving.
1:45:58|1:46:7|A bullet hit the ground in front of Zhao Yumin, and he quickly ducked down. Two gun barrels extended from the bunker, continuously firing bullets, while the team members closed their eyes and fell sideways on the slope.
1:46:13|1:46:19|[Zhao Yumin] saw the situation, grabbed his gun and quickly ran forward. He bent down and took a few quick steps, then lay down and continued to crawl forward.
1:46:19|1:46:24|The guerrilla fighters also raised their guns and returned fire at the enemy.
1:46:24|1:46:28|[Zhao Yumin] continued to crawl forward, with many Nationalist soldiers approaching ahead.
1:46:28|1:46:35|The guerrilla fighters kept firing to cover Zhao Yumin, who suddenly threw a grenade, knocking down the enemies charging ahead.
1:46:35|1:46:39|Following that, he threw another one, causing a large group of enemies running behind to fall down.
1:46:42|1:46:50|The team members lay behind the rocks providing cover fire with a dense barrage of bullets, while [Zhao Yumin] continued to crawl forward with a gun in hand, displaying a determined and brave look in her eyes.
1:46:50|1:46:53|The scene shifts, the Nationalist Army Chief of Staff is on the phone.
1:47:3|1:47:8|The commander on Ba Shang waved his hand, and a soldier covered his ears in anticipation of the explosion, but it never came.
1:47:8|1:47:14|He quickly looked outside, only to see that the fuse of the explosives had been cut.
1:47:14|1:47:18|[Zhao Yumin] breathed a long sigh of relief as she held the scissors in her hand.
1:47:18|1:47:25|The scene shifts to a large group of PLA soldiers running across the river.
1:47:25|1:47:29|They waded through the water effortlessly, creating ripples with each step.

1:47:48|1:47:53|The scene cuts to [Headmaster] answering the phone, his face turning pale.
1:47:53|1:48:0|The Headmaster blinked his eyes, showing an expression of disbelief, and then put down the phone to turn towards Commander Zhang.
1:48:16|1:48:23|The Headmaster sat on the ground like thunderstruck, breathing heavily.
1:48:38|1:48:48|The guard brought the gloves of [Headmaster] and placed them on the table. He looked at the gloves, reached out, and slowly pulled them towards himself.
1:48:48|1:48:54|The scene switches to a battlefield shrouded in smoke, with gunfire ringing out and buildings being hit by artillery fire, billowing thick smoke.
1:48:56|1:49:3|Many Kuomintang soldiers are running through the ruins with guns in hand.
1:49:3|1:49:15|The Kanke troops advanced under gunfire, with the ruins burning and emitting black smoke beside them.
1:49:15|1:49:19|Kangke broke a horizontal wooden fence and continued to drive forward.
1:49:23|1:49:29|The soldiers used tanks as cover, bending their waists and carrying guns, running behind.
1:49:29|1:49:34|Lieutenant Zhang and the machine gunner were lying behind the cover, continuously shooting forward.
1:49:34|1:49:38|The soldiers also began to shoot at the enemy across the way.
1:49:38|1:49:41|The gunfire was intense, and black smoke filled the air.
1:50:2|1:50:10|The enemy tanks advanced, with the tracks of the tanks behind them crushing the sandbags where they had just taken cover.
1:50:10|1:50:13|Inside the window, the soldier's machine gun is still spewing flames.
1:50:13|1:50:20|Suddenly, a shell blasted a large hole in the building above, bricks fell down, instantly knocking down three soldiers.
1:50:20|1:50:24|In the ruins, the tank continued to advance unstoppably.
1:50:24|1:50:28|A soldier runs towards the fallen Captain Zhang, who struggles to lift his head.
1:50:32|1:50:43|The soldier ran out quickly, while Captain Zhang struggled to the machine gun on the side, grasped it, aimed, and continued to shoot at the enemy.
1:50:43|1:50:50|Li Jin crawled out of the cover, stood up, took a few steps running, and then quickly moved sideways in the ruins.
1:50:50|1:50:59|He rolled and lay on the roadside slope, the tank exerted force, Li Jin kept throwing several grenades, suddenly, he covered his chest and lay down.
1:50:59|1:51:0|The soldiers are shooting.
1:51:2|1:51:12|Li Jin lifted his head, holding the explosive package, and continued to move forward quickly.
1:51:12|1:51:15|He pulled the fuse with his teeth and then rolled to the side.
1:51:15|1:51:18|The tank approached, its tracks blown off.
1:51:18|1:51:25|Black smoke filled the air as the tank's tracks were blown off and flowed to the side.
1:51:25|1:51:28|Li Jin lay on the ground, panting heavily, with a look of relief on his face.
1:51:32|1:51:49|Captain Liu helped him up and held him in his arms, then gritted his teeth and put him down, continuing to charge forward with his gun. The soldiers behind him ran after him, with the last soldier helping up Li Jin. The instructor observed the situation and suddenly stood up.
1:52:6|1:52:21|The soldiers struggled to return to their positions, and a few soldiers launched a fierce charge. Several enemy soldiers jumped into a window and ran away, while two soldiers emerged from the middle, raised their guns and shot, causing the fleeing enemies to fall one after another.
1:52:22|1:52:37|Two soldiers hid behind cover, threw grenades, then jumped out. The Nationalist soldiers panicked and were intercepted and eliminated by the Communist Party members.
1:52:37|1:52:49|The enemy troops in the bunker abandoned their positions and fled to the rear. The soldiers pursued closely, some of the enemy soldiers scattered in all directions, some put up resistance, but they were all eliminated one by one by the soldiers of the Liberation Army.
1:53:1|1:53:8|In the formation, the soldiers held their positions and launched a fierce artillery attack towards the enemy positions.
1:53:8|1:53:16|As the soldiers in the front charged forward, more soldiers jumped out of their own cover.
1:53:16|1:53:20|With a command, the cannon barrel trembled violently and fired a shell.
1:53:20|1:53:27|A row of cannons fired shells one by one, causing the PLA troops to run across the calm river.
1:53:27|1:53:29|A large group of reinforcements soldiers quickly ran towards the battlefield.
1:53:35|1:53:57|[Commander Gao] shouted loudly to everyone, and a new round of charge began. The charge signal sounded, and the soldiers rushed forward without hesitation, carrying their guns. They ran onto the battlefield full of ruins, chasing after the fleeing enemies.
1:53:57|1:54:3|Under the blue sky and white clouds, the reinforcements arrived, with a large number of soldiers shouting and launching the final charge forward.
1:54:5|1:54:12|They ran across the flat ground, dashed down the cover, leaped over the trench, and bravely charged towards the enemy.
1:54:12|1:54:21|The enemy was so intimidated by this momentum that they turned and fled for their lives.
1:54:21|1:54:28|They ran to a big cannon, hesitated for a moment, then turned around and continued to flee.
1:54:28|1:54:34|A large number of PLA soldiers rushed down the breakthrough, bypassed obstacles, and intercepted and killed the enemy who couldn't escape in time.
1:54:42|1:54:49|The shell landed, causing a plume of black smoke.
1:54:49|1:54:51|The soldiers chased the enemy through the smoke.
1:54:56|1:55:14|An enemy ran up the hill, staggered, and fell down. Soldiers followed and more PLA soldiers charged on horseback, brandishing their weapons. The hooves of the horses raised a lot of dust on the ground. The enemies ahead were terrified and fled in all directions. The cavalrymen climbed over a dirt mound and pursued the remaining enemies.
1:55:14|1:55:18|An enemy was just shot dead as he poked his head out of the tank turret, slumping over on top of the tank.
1:55:19|1:55:34|Several enemies ran down the hill and were intercepted by a soldier coming from the side. The soldier immediately engaged in hand-to-hand combat with an enemy officer. After a few moves, he pushed the enemy to the ground, ruthlessly stabbed with a bayonet, then pulled out the knife and ran away. One enemy soldier grabbed [Captain Liu], while another soldier knocked him down from behind.
1:55:34|1:55:41|A soldier stood on the tank and fired downward, causing the enemy to fall. Another team rushed in from the side, and everyone chased forward together.
1:55:45|1:55:51|The remaining enemy soldiers are following behind a surviving tank, shooting backwards while running.
1:55:51|1:55:55|Some people fell heavily to the ground, while others scrambled away.
1:55:55|1:55:59|The situation seemed to be settled.
1:55:59|1:56:4|[Commander Gao] stood in the rushing tide of the charge, looked back, waved his hand, and everyone continued to run forward.
1:56:4|1:56:8|As far as the eye can see, the mountains and fields are filled with soldiers of the People's Liberation Army.
1:56:8|1:56:10|The enemy tank struggled to climb up a dirt slope.
1:56:12|1:56:22|The remaining soldiers of the Nationalist Party followed behind, while a large number of enemy troops were running forward, intending to counterattack, but were forced back by several Liberation Army soldiers with guns.
1:56:22|1:56:31|The soldiers following behind the tank turned and ran, the top of the tank opened, a white flag was raised, and the soldiers who had nowhere to escape surrendered their weapons.

1:56:52|1:56:59|In the distance, several soldiers are standing on a tank searching for spoils of war.
1:56:59|1:57:5|Some soldiers stood on tanks, holding guns and watching the dejected prisoners being escorted along the main road. 
1:57:10|1:57:20|On the other side, the villagers rushed excitedly towards the triumphant soldiers, warmly shaking hands and embracing them.

1:59:13|1:59:21|Commander Gao covers himself with a blanket.
