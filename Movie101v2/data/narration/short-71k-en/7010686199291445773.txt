0:1:28|0:1:34|The driver got out of the car and headed straight for the entrance of the club.
0:1:34|0:1:43|He skillfully turned a corner and walked into a long corridor covered with posters.
0:2:48|0:2:56|[Lu Xiaoxing] threw him over her shoulder and slammed him to the ground, leaving everyone around in shock. She dragged [Liang Cong] out of the club as if she was escorting a prisoner.
0:2:59|0:3:6|[Liang Cong] struggled constantly, finally running out when [Lu Xiaoxing] opened the door. But before he could take a few steps, he was kicked to the ground by [Lu Xiaoxing].
0:3:6|0:3:11|She impatiently pulled off the decorative chain on Liang Cong's pants and tied his hands to the handle above the co-driver's seat.
0:3:21|0:3:27|[Lu Xiaoxing] sat in the driver's seat with a cold expression, skillfully started the car, reversed, and then shifted gears, leaving the club with [Liang Cong].
0:3:27|0:3:38|It was late at night, the car was driving smoothly on the viaduct. [Liang Cong] struggled for a long time but couldn't break free from the iron chains, feeling frustrated. Meanwhile, [Lu Xiaoxing] drove expressionlessly, completely ignoring him.
0:3:38|0:3:44|[Liang Cong] pleaded with a look at [Lu Xiaoxing].
0:4:1|0:4:6|[Liang Cong] glared angrily at [Lu Xiaoxing], then suddenly extended his foot to the bottom of the driver's seat and stepped on the gas pedal all the way down.
0:4:9|0:4:18|The car suddenly accelerated out of control, with [Lu Xiaoxing] trying to hold onto the steering wheel. Unaware that the seatbelt buckle had been opened, a bus suddenly appeared, causing [Lu Xiaoxing] to jerk the steering wheel.
0:4:18|0:4:27|Temporarily escaping a disaster, but the wheels lost control again, crashing into the roadside guardrail. [Lu Xiaoxing] felt a sudden darkness before her eyes, knowing nothing at all.
0:4:27|0:4:36|When she regained consciousness, [Lu Xiaoxing] found herself lying on the ground, covered in bruises, looking confusedly at the car stuck in the middle of the guardrail.
0:4:38|0:4:45|The car was swaying dangerously, while [Liang Cong] was still tied inside.
0:4:53|0:5:1|Liang Cong was eager to save himself, struggling constantly with his wrist. But as the movement intensified, the car tilted more and more severely. Liang Cong looked in horror at the vehicles passing under the bridge.
0:5:11|0:5:18|[Liang Cong] desperately pulled down the chain, unaware that the fence was increasingly unable to support the weight of the car.
0:5:18|0:5:25|When he struggled with all his might to break free, the car finally couldn't hold on any longer and flipped off the bridge.
0:5:26|0:5:33|At the same time as the car fell off the bridge, a truck came head-on and hit the car, sending it flying more than ten meters before coming to a stop.
0:5:33|0:5:40|In the late night on the overpass, with no cars passing by, only [Lu Xiaoxing] was lying on the ground, his life unknown.
0:5:40|0:5:46|The truck under the bridge with its hazard lights on stopped in the middle of the road, and the driver showed no intention of getting out.
0:5:46|0:5:51|[Lu Xiaoxing] closed his eyes tightly, and after moving his lips a few times murmuring, he remained unresponsive.
0:5:57|0:6:2|Three years have passed in the blink of an eye, and today is a sunny day, with the warm sunshine pouring into the room.
0:6:2|0:6:7|On the top shelf of the bookcase are a row of detective books, while below are various items such as printers, staplers, and computers.
0:6:10|0:6:18|The calendar on the table clearly shows that today is April 4, 2015.
0:6:18|0:6:25|At this moment, [Lu Xiaoxing] is sound asleep in bed, while a Labrador retriever is biting the curtain and pulling it to the edge.
0:6:25|0:6:33|Jumping onto Lu Xiaoxing's bed with ease, Lin Chong pulled back the blanket on her body, then leaned in towards Lu Xiaoxing's face, sniffing continuously.
0:6:33|0:6:40|[Lu Xiaoxing] turned over drowsily, slowly opened her eyes, her pupils unfocused.
0:6:40|0:6:48|Just looking ahead blankly, the car accident took away her younger brother and her eyes, leaving [Lu Xiaoxing] half-leaning on the bed.
0:6:48|0:6:54|After fumbling to get the phone, Lu Xiaoxing slid up the screen and skillfully tapped on the app on the left side of the screen to open the radio.
0:6:54|0:6:58|After doing all this, she felt around the bedside and tentatively put on her slippers.
0:7:32|0:7:38|After finishing washing up, [Lu Xiaoxing] went to the cloakroom and felt the Braille on the clothes hangers to select the outfit to wear for the day.
0:7:38|0:7:45|After changing clothes, she stuffed the diary on the table into her bag, and then put on the guide dog's leash specially designed for Labrador retrievers.
0:7:45|0:7:53|After completing all the preparations, she slowly walked towards the gate with the guide dog leading the way. Despite the assistance, the blind person's life still faced many inconveniences.
0:7:53|0:8:4|After stopping at the door with the guide dog, she carefully felt for the door handle, then moved along to the latch, turned the knob, [Lu Xiaoxing] took a deep breath, twisted the door handle and walked out of the house.
0:8:4|0:8:13|She walked slowly down the corridor with her guide dog, facing the sunlight, her shadow stretched long, marking the first step she took towards a new life.
0:8:13|0:8:17|At this moment, [Lu Xiaoxing] walked into the Yanzhou City Police Academy hand in hand with a guide dog.
0:8:17|0:8:24|This is the place she is most familiar with, and also the starting point of her own ideals, with police officers in uniform everywhere on campus.
0:8:24|0:8:31|[Lu Xiaoxing] made an appointment with the teacher and sat on a chair in the long corridor.
0:8:33|0:8:40|[Lu Xiaoxing] turned to the side, looking earnestly towards Teacher Ma.
0:9:18|0:9:25|Lu Xiaoxing stood at the intersection and pressed the button of the pedestrian crossing signal for the visually impaired.
0:9:25|0:9:33|Unexpectedly, the wires of this electrical box had been cut a long time ago. At this moment, a man ran to the roadside and looked around before rushing over.
0:9:33|0:9:44|Ignoring the red light on the zebra crossing, [Lu Xiaoxing] heard his footsteps and thought the green light was on, so she took [Liang Cong] by the hand and carefully stepped onto the zebra crossing, the world of [Lu Xiaoxing] was pitch black.
0:9:44|0:9:52|Subconsciously, only the green light was flickering in the distance, when suddenly a car slammed on the brakes in front of [Lu Xiaoxing].
0:9:55|0:10:0|Lu Xiaoxing was a bit flustered for a moment, and the flashing red light ahead was particularly dazzling.
0:10:0|0:10:8|[Lu Xiaoxing] turned around in a panic, in her world, she could only feel a truck rushing towards her with strong light in the darkness.
0:10:8|0:10:15|The bus didn't slow down at all, passing by [Lu Xiaoxing], who became even more panicked, looking around helplessly.
0:10:15|0:10:21|Leading [Liang Cong] forward quickly, she just wanted to cross the street quickly, but when she reached the edge of the street, she stumbled on a step.
0:10:21|0:10:27|The character Lu Xiaoxing seemed accustomed to knocking her shins on the stone pier, as she felt her way to sit on it and rolled up her right pant leg.
0:10:27|0:10:34|Pressing down to find two bruises, took out a bottle of spray from the bag, sprayed it on the calf, and went back home.
0:10:34|0:10:38|[Lu Xiaoxing] packed all her photos and certificates from the police academy into a cardboard box.
0:10:38|0:10:57|Then she proceeded to take down all the criminal investigation books from the bookshelf and put them into a cardboard box. With great effort, she moved the box into the storage room and closed the door. For [Lu Xiaoxing], these things might never be needed again. At that moment, [Liang Cong] was earnestly eating, while [Lu Xiaoxing] sat on the carpet nearby, listening to the sounds around her.
0:10:57|0:11:2|Liang Cong glanced at [Lu Xiaoxing], placed the food tray in front of [Lu Xiaoxing], and sat down obediently.
0:11:10|0:11:20|The sunshine outside the window is still bright, while the kitchen stove is cluttered with chopped food. The mess in the kitchen can be identified through the food residues, which was caused by preparing a meal for [Liang Cong].
0:11:20|0:11:31|[Liang Cong] was lying lazily in the arms of [Lu Xiaoxing], enjoying himself, while a girl threw herself at the iron gate, desperately pulling the handle. Her wrist was dripping with blood, but the gate didn't budge an inch.
0:11:31|0:11:42|She leaned against the iron gate, crying in despair. Suddenly, her face turned pale with fear as she listened carefully to the noise outside the door. She saw the girl quickly crawl to the corner of the stairs next to the iron gate and crouched down, not daring to move.
0:11:42|0:11:55|As the footsteps and whistling drew closer, the iron gate was opened. A pair of black leather shoes stepped in, seemingly unaware of the girl in the corner. He continued to walk inside, and the girl seized the opportunity to rush up the stairs and try to escape.
0:11:55|0:12:1|With a slip under her feet, she made a sound, turned back in despair, shook her head, and then desperately climbed up the stairs.
0:12:1|0:12:10|However, the man grabbed the girl's legs and pushed her into the dark corner, making her disappear. The iron gate was closed again, with a huge iron lock on it, sending shivers down one's spine.
0:12:22|0:12:30|[Lu Xiaoxing] walked slowly to the entrance, feeling the wall and opening the intercom in front of him.
0:12:30|0:12:33|On the screen appears the figure of a middle-aged woman.
0:12:48|0:12:54|[Lu Xiaoxing] came to the villa and opened the French windows in the living room.
0:12:54|0:13:2|Standing in the garden, she felt the atmosphere here and looked ahead lifelessly as if she had returned to her childhood.
0:13:5|0:13:10|In their youth, [Lu Xiaoxing] and [Liang Cong] joyfully ran in the garden, with mischievous [Liang Cong] climbing onto a sculpture.
0:13:11|0:13:18|[Liang Cong] climbed to the top and joyfully looked at the bird's nest above.
0:13:21|0:13:28|[Lu Xiaoxing] withdrew her gaze, sighed silently, and realized that no one had visited the courtyard for a long time.
0:13:28|0:13:37|The ground was covered with fallen branches and leaves, and the once pristine white sculpture that used to be climbed by the two, now looked old and dilapidated. [Lu Xiaoxing] carefully made her way to the top floor along the handrail.
0:13:37|0:13:45|The previously familiar home now had to be navigated by feeling. She stood at the doorway of [Liang Cong]'s bedroom, a scene from the past reappearing before her eyes.
0:13:52|0:13:59|The young [Liang Cong] flashed a brilliant smile and plucked the guitar strings.
0:13:59|0:14:5|[Lu Xiaoxing] seemed to really see [Liang Cong] sitting on the bed playing the guitar, tears instantly filled her eyes.
0:14:5|0:14:11|She steadied her emotions, lightly placing her hand on the wall, gliding past the poster photo of [Liang Cong], and walked to the middle of the cabinet.
0:14:11|0:14:21|On the cabinet stands the guitar that [Lu Xiaoxing] bought for [Liang Cong] back then. [Lu Xiaoxing] reaches out her hands, carefully picks up the guitar and holds it in her arms, gently caressing it. This is the bond between her and [Liang Cong].
0:14:21|0:14:23|It's also the only thing that can be used to remember.
0:14:23|0:14:32|After brushing the strings, she finally showed a hint of a smile, but suddenly as if remembering something? In an instant, the smile disappeared, and she hurriedly tried to put the guitar back in its original place.
0:14:32|0:14:40|Lu Xiaoxing's trembling hands did not successfully place the guitar on the stand, and the guitar slipped from her hands and fell to the ground.
0:14:48|0:14:59|The past is vividly remembered, always a hurdle that Lu Xiaoxing cannot get over. She stood there with her eyes tightly closed, motionless. If she hadn't been so excited at that time, would things not have turned out like this now? Unfortunately, there are no "ifs" in the world.
0:14:59|0:15:5|After a long time, [Lu Xiaoxing] came down from the building and stopped in his tracks.
0:15:6|0:15:13|The mother walked slowly behind [Lu Xiaoxing], frowning. She took [Lu Xiaoxing]'s hand and placed a device the size of a mobile phone in her palm.
0:16:3|0:16:13|The mother turned away, unable to hold back her tears. And at this moment, [Lu Xiaoxing] was already in tears.
0:16:13|0:16:21|The mother was at a loss for words for a moment.
0:16:21|0:16:26|[Lu Xiaoxing] ignored her mother and walked expressionlessly towards the door.
0:16:37|0:16:40|She shook her head self-deprecatingly and walked out of the door, leaning against the door frame.
0:16:42|0:16:52|The rain at night grew heavier, and soon there were several large puddles. [Lu Xiaoxing] and a group of people were waiting for a bus at the bus stop by the road, and soon many people hailed taxis and left.
0:17:11|0:17:17|Passengers waiting for the train suddenly all turned to look in the same direction on the platform.
0:17:28|0:17:33|[Lu Xiaoxing] may be in the dark, but she can still discern the movements of everyone around her through sound.
0:17:37|0:17:42|Time passed gradually, although the heavy rain continued, people at the station started to arrive one after another.
0:17:42|0:17:50|Fewer and fewer people stayed behind, until only [Lu Xiaoxing] and a girl in a sexy outfit, holding a cigarette, remained on the platform.
0:18:2|0:18:10|The taxi quickly pulled up and stopped in front of the girl. She frowned, looked up, and then ran through the rain to the passenger seat, opened the door, and got in.
0:18:10|0:18:17|The last person left the station, leaving [Lu Xiaoxing] standing there all alone.
0:18:17|0:18:23|[Lu Xiaoxing] fell silent for a moment, then tentatively reached out her hand to hail a taxi. Her hand froze in midair for a long time.
0:18:23|0:18:30|Trying to change direction and gesturing to hail a taxi, but it was still quite challenging for the blind [Lu Xiaoxing].
0:18:30|0:18:39|She put down her hand somewhat hesitantly, but the extreme heavy rain forced her to reach out for a taxi again. Her hand quickly got wet, but she failed to hail a taxi.
0:18:39|0:18:46|[Lu Xiaoxing] dropped her arm in despair, when a car approached her with its glaring headlights, making her aware of its presence.
0:18:46|0:18:51|[Lu Xiaoxing] had a vision of a taxi pulling up in front of her.
0:19:0|0:19:8|After carefully getting into the car, the man drove away from the station, with no sign of the rain stopping outside, but rather getting even heavier.
0:19:29|0:19:35|At the moment the man twisted the knob, warm air rushed out from the layers of equipment in the front passenger seat towards [Lu Xiaoxing].
0:19:35|0:19:39|And with the loss of vision, [Lu Xiaoxing]'s sense of smell became exceptionally sharp.
0:19:46|0:19:49|[Lu Xiaoxing] felt for the button on the back seat door and rolled down the window halfway.
0:19:49|0:19:54|The image of her sitting in the back seat of a taxi with the window down appeared in her mind again.
0:19:56|0:20:4|The man closed the car window for [Lu Xiaoxing] from the driver's seat, and secretly observed [Lu Xiaoxing] through the rearview mirror, with a hint of cunning in his eyes.
0:20:10|0:20:18|The man took out a bottle of coffee, reached out his right hand to the back seat, [Lu Xiaoxing] hesitantly reached out with both hands and touched the man's wrist, then took the coffee from his hand.
0:20:19|0:20:25|[Lu Xiaoxing] held a cup of coffee in one hand and leaned against the seat with the other. After touching the seat, she paused for a moment and then touched it repeatedly several times.
0:20:29|0:20:34|The man was a little surprised and couldn't help but reach out his right hand behind him and waved it in front of [Lu Xiaoxing].
0:20:37|0:20:42|The man quickly withdrew his right hand, as if relieved, while [Lu Xiaoxing] held the coffee tightly in both hands and remained silent.
0:20:42|0:20:47|The man stole another glance at [Lu Xiaoxing].
0:21:2|0:21:13|A woman crashed through the windshield, rolled over the roof of the car, and landed on the road. A man got out of the car, bent over to support his knees, looked at the woman for a long time, then bent down and dragged her upper body up.
0:21:13|0:21:32|[Lu Xiaoxing] was hit on the head by the sudden brake just now. She held her forehead for a long time before coming to her senses. With a furrowed brow, she instinctively looked up, her eyes filled with uncontrollable panic. [Lu Xiaoxing] felt around her seat, stuffing the recently dropped keys, pepper spray, and other items into her bag. Unfortunately, she didn't notice the diary that had fallen under the passenger seat. Afterwards, [Lu Xiaoxing] slung the bag over her shoulder.
0:21:32|0:21:40|Locking the car door, finding the switch, and opening the door, Lu Xiaoxing got out of the car. The rain outside was still heavy, with one hand protecting her head, she closed the car door.
0:21:40|0:21:47|At this moment, half of a man's body had just been moved out of the trunk, and he immediately closed the trunk.
0:21:56|0:22:1|[Lu Xiaoxing] shook off the man's hand and took out her phone from her pocket to make a call.
0:22:3|0:22:10|[Lu Xiaoxing] hurriedly crouched on the ground, searching for her phone. A man in the distance saw a car approaching and immediately bent down to pull [Lu Xiaoxing].
0:22:12|0:22:27|The man roughly pulled [Lu Xiaoxing] up, preparing to push her into the back seat. In a moment of desperation, [Lu Xiaoxing] grabbed the man's wrist and pinned him against the car. The man was unable to break free for a moment, but as the car behind approached, he panicked. He forcefully pushed [Lu Xiaoxing] to the ground, quickly opened the car door, sat in the driver's seat, and drove away from the scene.
0:22:27|0:22:35|[Lu Xiaoxing] struggled to get up and continued to search for the phone with [Lu Li]. She felt around on the ground for a long time and finally found it. In a hurry, [Lu Xiaoxing] picked up the phone, ready to call the police.
0:22:36|0:22:44|The car drove straight towards them, its lights blinding. A drunk man sat on the sofa, laughing foolishly.
0:23:15|0:23:23|The young police officer glanced absentmindedly at the drunken man playing with alcohol.
0:23:23|0:23:25|Turned around pretending to be serious.
0:23:47|0:23:55|[Lu Xiaoxing] was turning her head in confusion about what was happening around her, when an old policeman behind her stood up, stretched lazily, and walked towards the drunkard.
0:24:32|0:24:38|The old police officer limped over to the young police officer and impatiently took off his glasses frame,
0:24:57|0:25:3|He tapped the young police officer's head, indicating him to continue flipping through the report, and sat in front of [Lu Xiaoxing].
0:25:30|0:25:42|The old police officer looked at Lu Xiaoxing in astonishment, but Lu Xiaoxing ignored him. She shook off the hand that grabbed her wrist, then reached out and took the young police officer's arm. The officer dared not move recklessly and carefully led her towards the door.
0:25:42|0:25:49|The old police officer sat in the chair, watching [Lu Xiaoxing] leave the office with a scrutinizing look on his face, before finally lifting his legs up and hugging his knees.
0:25:49|0:25:51|Rubbing his knee joints with a frown.
0:25:52|0:26:15|The yellow light bulb flickered, revealing an eerie atmosphere everywhere. A girl slowly opened her eyes while lying on the bed, staring blankly at the ceiling. There were a few scratches and bruises on her face, with dried blood on the side. The girl subconsciously looked around and found another girl lying on a single bed to her left, with her wrists and ankles tied to the bed. Her eyes half-opened, seemingly lifeless.
0:26:37|0:26:42|The man tenderly approached the girl, one hand clawed and pressed down on the girl's head, his expression becoming even gentler.
0:26:44|0:26:53|The girl struggled in fear, but her movements became smaller and smaller, soon she stopped moving. Beside her lay a carefully kept diary, with a clear message written on it: "If you find this, please contact in 8 words."
0:26:56|0:27:5|The man picked up a delicate surgical knife and cut along the lines drawn on the girl's face, blood gushing out and splashing onto the man's face. He didn't mind at all, but instead enjoyed it immensely.
0:27:7|0:27:24|Gently bending down, without hesitation, Lu Xiaoxing moved towards the girl. As he crawled, the man looked at the wall behind him, where a huge photo was projected. The photo showed a girl in white clothes with a lovely face, slightly round, very cute. The slides kept changing, all showing the same girl's appearance.
0:27:24|0:27:31|A man's gaze is filled with infatuation and nostalgia, as a person wearing black canvas shoes appears in the hallway of [Lu Xiaoxing]'s home one day.
0:27:53|0:27:58|[Lu Xiaoxing] walked out of the bathroom and fumbled for the access phone on the wall to make a call.
0:28:13|0:28:22|The old police officer's words made [Liang Cong] furrow his brows, while [Lu Li] crouched on the ground, looking expressionlessly at the young police officer who was pouting and amusing himself, then disdainfully turned his head away.
0:29:36|0:29:42|[Lu Li] hurriedly opened a notebook.
0:30:9|0:30:13|[Lu Li] involuntarily raised his left wrist.
0:30:23|0:30:31|Officer Lu Li turned his eyes, touched his nose, and nodded thoughtfully.
0:30:54|0:31:2|Another sunny day, on a deserted street, a group of rollerblading teenagers zoom past, showing off their skills.
0:31:2|0:31:12|Some people leap over the safety belt, some jump up and do a 360-degree turn, a boy wearing a duck hat crosses a clearing, then elegantly turns back, standing in front of a notice.
0:31:12|0:31:20|Please carefully read the above content. The notice indicates that a traffic accident occurred on the evening of April 11th, and valuable clues are needed from the public.
0:31:44|0:31:51|The young police officer subconsciously looked at Officer Lu with his chin in his hand.
0:32:2|0:32:8|The young police officer awkwardly licked his lips, while Officer Lu continued to turn around to look at the slides.
0:32:29|0:32:37|The boy in the duckbill cap sat across from [Lu Li], impatiently glanced at [Lu Xiaoxing]. [Lu Li] raised his eyebrows and sighed, the boy seemed accustomed to such distrust and rolled his eyes.
0:32:37|0:32:45|He wanted to take a look at [Lu Xiaoxing], extending a finger to wave in front of [Lu Xiaoxing], and becoming even more reckless when he found [Lu Xiaoxing] unresponsive.
0:33:29|0:33:34|[Lu Xiaoxing] sat up straight and ignored the boy, who looked around boredly.
0:33:34|0:33:42|Suddenly, [Lin Chong] stared at the phone on the table of Lu Xiaoxing, took out his own phone and compared them side by side.
0:33:45|0:33:58|[Lu Xiaoxing] expressionlessly picked up her phone, turned on the camera, switched to selfie mode, and approached the boy. The boy confidently looked at the phone screen and even leaned towards the lens, narcissistically adjusting his bangs.
0:35:8|0:35:18|The boy's phone rang, the familiar ringtone causing [Lu Xiaoxing] to involuntarily turn his body.
0:35:18|0:35:27|The boy chuckled after hanging up the phone, his face once again showing that mischievous expression.
0:35:47|0:35:55|The boy reluctantly turned his head, giving a response, and then walked out of the office with a straight face. At this moment, a female police officer walked in holding a folder.
0:36:1|0:36:9|The female police officer looked up at [Lu Xiaoxing] and froze.
0:36:19|0:36:23|[Lu Li] was carefully looking at the documents, while Ya Nan smiled at Lu Xiaoxing and walked out of the office.
0:36:23|0:36:29|It was only then that [Lu Li] looked up and saw the two of them, as a girl walked out of the nightclub at night.
0:36:31|0:36:37|The girl, with a graceful figure, wearing 10-centimeter high heels and holding a cigarette in her hand, walked down the stairs and waved to someone in the distance.
0:36:37|0:36:40|A sedan came to a stop in front of her.
0:36:42|0:36:49|The girl leaned against the window with a smile, elegantly opened the car door and sat in, while the driver was still the man who caused the accident.
0:36:49|0:36:55|The girl threw the cigarette out of the window, fastened her seatbelt, and then the man smiled as he drove away from the nightclub, with no one around noticing anything unusual.
0:36:57|0:37:4|[Lu Xiaoxing] returned home and opened the storage room door again. She moved two large cardboard boxes out and stacked them on the living room floor.
0:37:4|0:37:11|Then [Jingkuang] quietly knelt on the side of the Mosuo paper box cover, as if cheering herself up, took a deep breath and opened the paper box.
0:37:11|0:37:15|Crime psychology and other criminal investigation books are neatly arranged inside.
0:37:30|0:37:36|[Lu Xiaoxing]'s phone suddenly rang, the screen showed an unknown number, and she answered the call without any awareness.
0:37:36|0:37:44|In the car, a medicine bottle was left at the edge of the seat, and [Lu Xiaoxing]'s diary was held in the man's hand.
0:37:48|0:38:0|The man hung up the phone expressionlessly, flipped through his phone to look closely at a photo. The girl in the photo was the one who had just gotten into his car. The man looked at the passenger seat with a smile that was not a smile, only to see that the girl had already fallen asleep.
0:38:0|0:38:4|He then calmly threw his phone out of the car and drove away in the sedan.
0:38:4|0:38:16|The following vehicle ran over the phone, instantly shattering it into pieces. There were many vehicles coming and going on this road, and soon the phone was crushed beyond recognition. Meanwhile, the police station was still brightly lit.
0:39:14|0:39:27|[Lu Xiaoxing] knew she was right, so she could only nod, while [Liang Cong] was sleeping soundly on the side. They spent the whole day listening to recordings in the car, and [Lu Li] handed a hamburger to [Lu Xiaoxing].
0:39:29|0:39:37|[Lu Li] nodded in agreement, opened the wrapper of the hamburger and took a big bite. [Liang Cong] sat in the back seat staring at the hamburger in [Lu Li]'s hand, almost drooling.
0:39:38|0:39:47|[Lu Li] jokingly handed the hamburger to [Liang Cong]'s mouth and then pulled it back.
0:39:47|0:39:57|Liang Cong seemed to understand, lying gloomily on the seat, Lu Li drove the car away after finishing the burger, taking Lu Xiaoxing home.
0:39:57|0:40:4|On the other side, [Lin Chong] skated over and stopped in front of the sign, rolling his eyes disdainfully.
0:40:13|0:40:20|The man recalled the day when he was driving away and happened to pass by [Lin Chong] who was standing on the roadside holding an umbrella, and they both glanced at each other.
0:40:22|0:40:28|[Lin Chong] vented for a while as if not relieved, then took out his phone and called [Lu Li].
0:40:40|0:40:43|[Lin Chong] stubbornly hung up the phone, looking very displeased at the screen.
0:40:43|0:40:46|Lu Xiaoxing picked up the phone and left on roller skates following the billboard.
0:40:46|0:40:53|The man sat in the car observing Lin Chong. After seeing Lin Chong leave, he started the car and quietly followed behind him.
0:41:7|0:41:13|[Lu Li] blinked discreetly, [Lu Xiaoxing] was not surprised, just sighed softly.
0:41:54|0:42:6|[Lu Li] glanced guiltily at [Lu Xiaoxing], awkwardly waved his hand to fan the air around him, then quickly lowered the car window to let the smell dissipate. As the window went down, a familiar voice resounded once again, and [Lu Xiaoxing] listened quietly.
0:42:6|0:42:12|Her expression turned serious, as she recalled the man in the car also made the same sound when he rolled down the window.
0:42:13|0:42:21|After the man closed the window for [Lu Xiaoxing] from the driver's seat, the strange noise disappeared.
0:42:44|0:42:50|But on that taxi, [Lu Li] was a bit surprised and couldn't help but look at [Lu Xiaoxing] several times.
0:43:2|0:43:12|[Lu Xiaoxing] recalls the sound of the car hitting the girl and shattering the windshield, only this time the scene changes from a taxi to a Golf 6, and now this Golf 6 follows [Lin Chong] to a small fountain.
0:43:12|0:43:19|He parked the car on the side, turned off the engine and lights, while [Lin Chong] remained completely unaware, sliding and answering the phone.
0:43:20|0:43:28|The man stared at Lin Chong's every move, gently closing the notebook. Beside the notebook was a delicate music box, and the man, dressed smartly, also wore a baseball cap.
0:43:28|0:43:39|After getting off the car, he pulled up his scarf, only revealing a pair of eyes, [Lu Li] complained and hung up the phone.
0:43:46|0:43:50|[Lu Li] anxiously looked ahead, waiting for the right moment to sharply turn the steering wheel.
0:43:50|0:43:58|Turning around and walking back, at this moment [Lin Chong] is still leisurely rollerblading forward.
0:44:12|0:44:19|[Lin Chong] hung up the phone, continued to slide forward with his hands in his pockets, skillfully took out a pair of black leather gloves, put them on, and continued to follow closely behind him.
0:44:26|0:44:47|[Lin Chong] hummed a song without noticing, while the man looked back vigilantly, quickening his pace towards [Lin Chong] after confirming that no one was coming. [Lin Chong] leisurely took a few steps forward, suddenly feeling something amiss behind him. He subtly turned his head back a bit, stopped in his tracks, then boldly turned half of his face towards the man behind him, directly halting him. The man hesitated for a moment and didn't dare to approach, while [Lin Chong] nonchalantly turned away.
0:44:47|0:44:56|Rushing forward quickly, the man soon realized and sprinted after, [Lin Chong] swiftly turned a corner, but the man stopped after turning into an alley, looking around.
0:44:56|0:44:59|He picked up a motorcycle leaning against the wall and rode on it.
0:45:1|0:45:18|The man once again closely chased after [Lin Chong], who turned into a narrow alley two meters wide, desperately sliding forward. He frowned and glanced back, only to find the motorcycle getting closer, its headlight illuminating the path ahead clearly. With the end in sight, in the last moment, [Lin Chong] made a 180-degree sharp turn, facing the motorcycle once again.
0:45:18|0:45:41|He paused for a second, clearly seeing the fierce eyes of the man, then turned sharply again, gracefully sliding down the handrail of the stairs. The man slammed on the brakes, his face staring fiercely at the figure of [Lin Chong]. He revved the motorcycle again and rode down the stairs in front of him. The motorcycle swiftly turned and caught up again. [Lin Chong] crossed a flower bed and slipped into a narrow alley only one meter wide. The inherent speed advantage of the motorcycle quickly brought him to [Lin Chong].
0:45:41|0:46:5|Behind him, after [Lin Chong] rushed out from under his feet and down a few steps, the motorcycle followed without hesitation. Following directly behind, [Lin Chong] turned another corner and slid into a construction site. He bent over, spun around, passed through the scaffolding, leaped over a large construction pit, provocatively glanced back, then smoothly slid away. The man stopped by the roadside, glanced at [Lin Chong], then turned and rode into another alley. [Lin Chong] breathed a sigh of relief only after watching him go far away.
0:46:7|0:46:13|[Lin Chong] looked puzzled and angry as he glanced in the direction the motorcycle was leaving, sliding forward while taking out his phone, staring at the screen with a displeased expression.
0:46:15|0:46:34|[Lin Chong] impatiently put down his phone and slid towards the intersection. He didn't notice the Golf 6 parked next to him. Suddenly, the car's headlights lit up, shining into [Lin Chong]'s eyes. The car accelerated abruptly, hitting [Lin Chong] and sending him flying to the side of the road. [Lin Chong] fell to the ground, blood seeping from his head. The man quickly reversed the car and stopped in front of [Lin Chong] again, his foot constantly pressing on the gas pedal.
0:46:34|0:46:41|His face couldn't hide the cold and ruthless expression, he was about to step on the gas pedal, but a few boys appeared in front of him.
0:47:12|0:47:16|Xing stood by the roadside listening to the noise, unaware that the man was standing right beside her.
0:47:18|0:47:27|[Lu Li] returned to the car, [Lu Xiaoxing] fumbled and sat back in the passenger seat. Two ambulances drove forward, with [Lu Li]'s car following closely behind. The people around scattered, leaving only a man with his hands in his pockets.
0:47:27|0:47:34|Standing still in place, he didn't move for a long time. Finally, he took two steps forward, calmly raised his head, and looked in the direction where the ambulance was leaving.
0:47:34|0:47:42|[Lin Chong]'s head has been bandaged and he is lying on the bed receiving intravenous fluids, still in a coma. [Lu Xiaoxing] is standing outside the window anxiously waiting.
0:48:7|0:48:13|At this moment, [Lu Xiaoxing] is sitting on a chair in the hospital lobby, while [Lu Li] walks over with two cans of coffee.
0:48:15|0:48:21|[Lu Li] carefully pulled the tab of the soda can for [Lu Xiaoxing], then sat down across from her.
0:48:30|0:48:38|[Lu Xiaoxing] stood up straight, carefully sniffing the small cart pushed behind her. She suddenly turned around to face the cart moving away, once again immersed in memories.
0:48:38|0:48:44|That night, the man turned the knob and turned on the warm air inside the car.
0:49:6|0:49:13|[Lu Li] furrowed his brow, looking serious, as he leaned back in his chair and nodded in agreement.
0:50:6|0:50:17|[Lu Li] quickly took the phone, took out his own phone while walking towards the nearby gate. After walking out of the gate, he looked solemnly at the screen of [Lu Xiaoxing], and immediately made a call with his own phone.
0:50:20|0:50:22|[Lu Xiaoxing] sat on the chair, with a somewhat heavy expression.
0:50:22|0:50:30|The next day, [Lin Chong] lay on the hospital bed, as if feeling some strange sensation, furrowing his brow and opening his eyes.
0:50:30|0:50:35|Liang Cong licked his toes, which scared Lin Chong into pulling back his toes and sitting up.
0:51:26|0:51:33|[Lin Chong] sat on the other side of the hospital bed with his back to [Lu Xiaoxing], heaved a sigh of relief, picked up the roller skate shoes at his feet and held them in his arms, gently brushing off the dust on them.
0:51:55|0:52:3|Facing the perfunctory nod from [Lu Li], [Lin Chong] rolled his eyes speechlessly, feeling somewhat embarrassed in the face of [Lin Chong]'s lingering resentment.
0:52:18|0:52:23|[Lu Li] pointed angrily at [Lin Chong] while scratching his head, and [Lin Chong] turned around with a mocking smile.
0:52:28|0:52:34|[Liang Cong] looked at [Lu Li] with some dissatisfaction, and [Lu Li] quickly reached out to pat [Liang Cong]'s head.
0:54:0|0:54:4|[Lu Li] frowned and glanced at [Lu Xiaoxing], then looked silently out the window.
0:54:4|0:54:16|The water from the shower head kept spraying out, [Lu Xiaoxing] sat blankly in the bathtub, staring ahead without focus. Suddenly, the alarm went off, [Lu Xiaoxing] numbly got up from the edge of the bathtub, took down the alarm and turned off the shower.
0:54:16|0:54:25|She didn't know the meaning of her actions, whether she was causing trouble or genuinely trying to help. She closed her eyes and heard [Lin Chong]'s angry words echoing in her ears.
0:54:44|0:54:51|[Lu Xiaoxing] weakly raised her arm, embarrassedly covered her eyes, while numerous shallow and deep cuts were visible on her arms and wrists.
0:54:51|0:54:58|[Lu Xiaoxing] sits in the water, tightly hugging her arms, as if this is the only way to give herself a tiny sense of security.
0:54:58|0:55:1|The phone screen on the table suddenly lights up, still showing unknown.
0:55:1|0:55:12|Lu Xiaoxing, wearing a bathrobe, carefully stepped out of the bathroom, feeling her way to the table. She picked up the phone, took a deep breath, and held it to her ear.
0:56:33|0:56:41|The man greedily stared at the diary, with his phone placed on the table. [Lu Xiaoxing] was already in tears, she despairingly put down the phone, finding it hard to accept for a moment.
0:56:41|0:56:48|The phone rang inside the car, showing a call from [Lu Xiaoxing], while at that moment [Lu Li] was discussing the case with [Jingkuang] at the crime scene outside the car.
0:57:14|0:57:20|He refused to move forward, no matter how much he looked up.
0:57:27|0:57:32|[Lin Chong] plugged in his phone to charge, the long message displayed on the screen made him furrow his brows.
0:57:32|0:57:44|Dozens of messages all came from [Lu Xiaoxing], almost all of them were dangerous, asking him not to leave the hospital now. As soon as the words fell, [Lu Xiaoxing] brought [Liang Cong] to the ward, leaving [Lin Chong] incredulously turning back.
0:58:19|0:58:28|[Lin Chong] broke free and walked away without looking back, while his companions sneaked past [Lu Xiaoxing] with their bodies turned sideways.
0:58:28|0:58:33|[Lu Xiaoxing] slowly put down her hand, unaware that the man in the corner not far away had already set his sights on her.
0:58:41|0:58:58|[Lin Chong] looked in the direction of his companion and saw [Liang Cong] carefully boarding a bus on the opposite side of the street. [Lin Chong] disdainfully lowered his head, then suddenly straightened up in alert as he noticed the man following closely behind [Lu Xiaoxing] boarding the same bus. [Lin Chong] hesitated and took two uncertain steps forward.
0:58:58|0:59:6|He saw a man on the bus gradually approaching [Lu Xiaoxing] and [Lin Chong], bowing his head, tightly gripping his phone, and making a decision in a moment.
0:59:13|0:59:29|[Lin Chong] rushed to the other side of the road, flagged down a bus and quickly got on. He anxiously put on his headphones and looked ahead at the bus where [Lu Xiaoxing] was sitting. His phone vibrated, and [Lu Xiaoxing] calmly raised the phone to his ear.
0:59:37|0:59:42|At this moment, [Lin Chong] was extremely anxious, constantly looking ahead, while [Lu Xiaoxing] was clueless, still listening to instructions and putting on headphones.
1:0:2|1:0:14|[Lu Xiaoxing] didn't realize that the man had been watching her every move without any disguise, [Lin Chong] kept staring at the front with his phone, only to find the bus he was on suddenly turning right, leaving [Lin Chong] watching helplessly as the front bus drove away.
1:0:14|1:0:19|Hastily running towards the rear door of the bus, he stared at the bus where Lu Xiaoxing was sitting.
1:0:20|1:0:26|The bus came to a stop just in time at the station. [Lin Chong] hurriedly got off the bus and ran towards the intersection, while [Lu Xiaoxing] pretended to be calm and stood up.
1:0:39|1:0:47|[Lu Xiaoxing] walked forward stiffly, while [Lin Chong] held up his phone and could only see the car door through the camera.
1:0:50|1:0:58|[Lin Chong] was extremely anxious, his feet skating faster and faster. The bus quickly arrived at the stop and parked by the roadside. A man stood to the right rear of [Lu Xiaoxing], following her slow steps down the stairs.
1:1:7|1:1:18|The man followed [Lu Xiaoxing] closely, with a knife pressed tightly against her waist, showing no signs of relaxation. [Lu Xiaoxing] slowly moved onto the blind path, carefully walking forward. She slowly lowered her phone and reached into her bag to search for something.
1:1:18|1:1:26|The man stared alertly at the side of [Lu Xiaoxing], but paid no attention to her hand movements. Suddenly, [Lu Xiaoxing] took out a pepper spray and sprayed it backward after taking a deep breath.
1:1:50|1:1:58|[Lu Xiaoxing] quickly turned into a street under the guidance of [Liang Cong] and [Lin Chong]. [Lin Chong] anxiously stared at his phone, his pace getting faster and faster, while [Lu Xiaoxing] had already reached the end of the road.
1:2:0|1:2:8|[Lu Xiaoxing] hurriedly stopped and felt the patterns on the floor. The man quickly caught up and followed [Lu Xiaoxing] into the mall, rubbing his eyes continuously.
1:2:10|1:2:15|[Lu Xiaoxing] immediately turned the corner and started running along the right passage. The man walked faster and glanced back, his expression becoming even more ruthless.
1:2:18|1:2:26|[Lu Xiaoxing] rushed into the stairwell, losing control and hitting the wall. [Lin Chong] slid forward in increasing urgency, while [Lu Xiaoxing] stumbled down the stairs.
1:2:26|1:2:38|The man walked briskly in the mall, glancing around fiercely. At this moment, Lu Xiaoxing successfully walked down the stairs and continued to run along the tactile paving. Liang Cong ran faster and faster, while Lu Xiaoxing was already exhausted, stumbling and falling to the ground.
1:2:54|1:3:3|[Lu Xiaoxing] felt the tactile paving under her feet, and the path ahead seemed to become clearer in her mind. At this moment, the man rushed towards the staircase, and [Lu Xiaoxing] stood up, feeling her way with her phone.
1:3:4|1:3:12|[Lin Chong] looked at Lu Xiaoxing in the video with a worried expression, while Lu Xiaoxing followed the route in her mind, holding her phone in one hand and feeling her way forward as she ran.
1:3:12|1:3:20|The pace is gradually picking up, the man plunges into the stairwell and rushes downstairs, [Liang Cong] sniffing the scent of [Lu Xiaoxing] on the ground, quickly running towards [Lu Xiaoxing].
1:3:20|1:3:32|[Lu Xiaoxing] dared not stop, running forward quickly. [Liang Cong] finally caught up with [Lu Xiaoxing], sprinting behind her, with the man appearing at the back at this moment.
1:3:32|1:3:36|Upon seeing [Lu Xiaoxing], his expression became more ferocious, and his speed increased.
1:3:38|1:3:46|[Lu Xiaoxing] ran quickly, closely followed by [Liang Cong]. The man was only 100 meters away from them. [Lu Xiaoxing] followed the blind path up a slope and rushed into a first-floor parking lot.
1:3:49|1:3:55|[Lu Xiaoxing] followed [Lin Chong]'s instructions and ran straight to the elevator, while [Liang Cong] also ran into the parking lot and headed towards [Lu Xiaoxing].
1:3:55|1:4:2|[Lu Xiaoxing] stumbled and lunged towards the elevator door, pressed the elevator button, and as she just crawled into the elevator, [Liang Cong] also rushed in.
1:4:3|1:4:21|At this moment, a man also entered the parking lot. [Lu Xiaoxing] hurriedly climbed to the door and pressed the button. The door immediately closed, but the man reached his arm into the elevator, opening the door. He looked viciously at [Lu Xiaoxing], took out a syringe from his pocket, removed the needle cover, grabbed [Lu Xiaoxing]'s chin, and pushed the syringe into [Lu Xiaoxing]'s neck.
1:4:21|1:4:31|Soon, [Lu Xiaoxing]'s eyes became unfocused. Just as the man pulled out the syringe, he was pounced on by [Liang Cong], who bit onto his clothes. [Liang Cong] then roared as he dragged the man out of the elevator shaft, refusing to let go.
1:4:31|1:4:42|Lu Xiaoxing subconsciously covered her neck and weakly fainted in the corner of the elevator, while Liang Cong bit down on the man's clothes and couldn't let go. The man then took out a surgical knife from his pocket without hesitation and stabbed towards Liang Cong.
1:4:42|1:4:55|Blood splattered all over the faces of the men and [Lu Xiaoxing]. [Liang Cong] sobbed, but still refused to let go. As the elevator doors slowly closed, the man could only watch helplessly as [Lu Xiaoxing] left. Inside the elevator, [Lu Xiaoxing] unconsciously furrowed her brows, but ultimately did not wake up.
1:4:55|1:5:0|The man vented all his grievances on [Liang Cong], who finally ran out of strength and weakly let go.
1:5:0|1:5:5|The elevator successfully reached a floor, and [Lu Xiaoxing] was temporarily saved.
1:5:5|1:5:12|[Liang Cong] lay on the ground, covered in blood, already at the end of his rope. The man gritted his teeth fiercely and gave [Liang Cong] a fierce glare.
1:5:12|1:5:20|Crossing over its body and running upstairs, at this moment, [Liang Cong] with eyes tightly closed, collapsed on the ground, bravely finishing his life.
1:5:29|1:5:35|A janitor was mopping the floor when she saw [Lu Xiaoxing], covered in blood, in the elevator, and she collapsed in fear.
1:5:35|1:5:49|[Lu Xiaoxing] was seen slumped in the corner of the elevator, completely unconscious. A police officer rushed into the elevator to help [Lu Xiaoxing] up, while another officer ran towards the door. A man peeked his head out from the corner, quietly observing the scene before him.
1:5:49|1:5:58|[Lu Xiaoxing] lay on the hospital bed, the scars on her wrist particularly striking, while [Lin Chong] sat by the bed with a worried expression written all over his face.
1:6:6|1:6:9|[Lu Li] hurriedly grabbed [Lu Xiaoxing]'s hand, looking helplessly to the side.
1:6:50|1:6:56|Lu Xiaoxing's hand was frozen in midair, unable to move for a moment, while Lin Chong looked at Lu Xiaoxing with tears streaming down her face in distress.
1:6:56|1:7:5|Lu Li turned around with a furrowed brow, unable to bear it, while Lu Xiaoxing's lips trembled, and her nostrils slightly flared as her emotions deepened.
1:7:5|1:7:12|Her shoulders couldn't help but tremble, [Lu Xiaoxing] tightly holding the leash in her arms, constantly rubbing the dog tag that resembled [Liang Cong].
1:7:12|1:7:20|She closed her eyes in pain, and with a powerless bow, [Lu Xiaoxing] cried and cried, sliding directly from the sickbed to sit paralyzed on the ground.
1:7:20|1:7:29|She tightly pressed the leash against her chest, as if trying to merge [Liang Cong] into her life, [Lu Xiaoxing] let out a weak roar, almost out of breath.
1:7:45|1:7:54|[Lu Li] covered his mouth and remained silent, looking out the window, while [Lin Chong] stood by, head down and speechless. The only thing they could do at this moment was to silently accompany each other.
1:7:54|1:8:1|In the busy scene at the police station, an undercover police officer hurriedly walked towards the office of [Lu Li] with a file in hand.
1:8:48|1:8:54|[Lu Li] gave the order, and the police officers hurried to their respective positions. On the other side, [Lin Chong] carefully described the man's appearance.
1:8:54|1:8:59|Soon, a suspect's portrait appeared on the screen, bearing an 80% resemblance to the man.
1:8:59|1:9:5|At this moment, the man is checking the news on the computer, where the detailed description of the night's incident is shown in the news column.
1:9:5|1:9:13|The news reported that the public security department has launched a search based on information from eyewitnesses. The man here has a fierce look on his face, with the corners of his mouth twitching slightly.
1:9:13|1:9:20|He collected himself and quickly typed on the keyboard to search for more information, while the police station was still brightly lit at night.
1:9:37|1:9:42|[Lin Chong] suddenly stood up, instantly attracting countless eyes in the office. He quickly opened his phone and played a song.
1:9:57|1:10:4|On the screen, the singer of the song "Insects Flying" is [Liang Cong].
1:10:19|1:10:27|[Lu Li] excitedly pounded [Lin Chong]'s chest a few times, then grabbed his shoulders and shook him hard.
1:10:34|1:10:40|He approached [Lu Xiaoxing], proudly thumping his chest, while [Lin Chong] frowned and propped up his chin.
1:10:52|1:11:2|[Lu Xiaoxing] held the traction rope and looked lost to one side. [Lin Chong] knew he had misspoken, his excitement vanished completely, and he nervously pursed his lips.
1:11:2|1:11:9|He pondered for a moment, then suddenly got up and gently took Lu Xiaoxing's hand. Lu Xiaoxing, at a loss, let go of the reins and stood up straight.
1:11:9|1:11:15|Lin Chong bent over, holding Lu Xiaoxing's hand with one hand behind his back, looking sincerely into Lu Xiaoxing's eyes.
1:11:18|1:11:26|[Lu Xiaoxing] stared blankly at [Lin Chong], not knowing what he was up to. At night, [Lin Chong] took [Lu Xiaoxing] to an outdoor roller skating rink and taught her how to skate.
1:12:0|1:12:3|As if infected by the emotions of [Lin Chong], [Lu Xiaoxing] also showed a rare smile.
1:12:3|1:12:9|The two of them skated hand in hand leisurely in the roller skating rink, with the ceiling lights resembling stars twinkling above.
1:12:9|1:12:17|Lu Xiaoxing's roller skating skills are not proficient. Every now and then, she stumbles forward, but it doesn't affect her rare moment of relaxation.
1:12:28|1:12:42|A man walked slowly into the basement, where two girls lay unconscious on the hospital bed with IV drips. One of the girls, dressed in white, had her limbs tied to the bed and her face was covered in lines drawn by a plastic surgeon.
1:13:44|1:13:50|The man bent down to turn his sister over and cradled her head, only to find a large patch of blood on the back of her head. He shook his sister's body in panic.
1:13:54|1:14:16|A man in the basement walks slowly towards the girl in the projection, looking at her obsessively. He recalls the scene of that rainy night when he was lying on the ground crying with his sister in his arms. Looking up at the girl in the photo wearing a white dress and smiling brightly, the man's expression reveals endless memories. That night, he sat on the ground holding his sister's body for a long time, the weather mirroring his mood.
1:14:16|1:14:18|It has never been sunny again.
1:14:18|1:14:26|It was still night. The man stood by the French window, looking quietly outside for a long time before turning around and walking slowly towards the desk.
1:14:26|1:14:33|He casually opened the drawer, revealing a dozen identical phones inside, with a dozen SIM cards scattered in the corner.
1:14:33|1:14:39|The man randomly took out a mobile phone and inserted a SIM card, then pressed the power button expressionlessly.
1:14:39|1:14:54|The screen illuminated his gloomy face, then he installed an app on his phone. At the same time, [Jingkuang] was still sitting in front of the computer at the police station, the guy's new ID had already logged in, and [Lu Li] immediately rushed to the screen.
1:15:6|1:15:9|A taxi pulled up in front of the villa where [Lu Xiaoxing] used to live.
1:15:9|1:15:26|After getting off the car, [Lu Xiaoxing] hesitantly reached out and grabbed [Lin Chong]'s arm. While [Lin Chong] led [Lu Xiaoxing] forward, he curiously looked up at the luxurious villa. Meanwhile, [Lu Li] drove the car with [Jingkuang] on the highway. He hung up the phone and looked at [Lu Li].
1:15:44|1:15:53|[Lin Chong] cautiously pushed open the big door, revealing a dark interior. He supported [Lu Xiaoxing] as they walked slowly into the hall, while [Lu Xiaoxing] felt along the wall and turned on all the lights in the room.
1:15:53|1:15:59|[Lin Chong] was amazed when he saw the full view of the villa, his mouth wide open in astonishment, looking around like a curious baby.
1:16:4|1:16:19|[Lu Xiaoxing] felt his way along the wall, slowly climbing the spiral staircase on the side. Meanwhile, [Lin Chong] excitedly walked into the living room, threw himself onto the sofa, patted the firm cushion, and then rolled over to lie down on the other side, stretching out his arms in a very relaxed manner.
1:16:19|1:16:26|[Lu Xiaoxing] then came to [Liang Cong]'s room and searched for something. When she touched [Liang Cong]'s photo frame, she smiled with relief.
1:16:26|1:16:44|Later, she found the ukulele placed in the middle of the cabinet, took it down and held it in her arms, gently stroking it. [Lin Chong] flipped over the photo frame on the table, inside was a family photo of [Lu Xiaoxing] and her family of four.
1:16:48|1:17:3|[Lin Chong] suddenly frowned and leaned in to look closely at the photo of [Liang Cong]. He immediately picked up another frame on the table and then turned to look at the photo on the wall. [Lu Xiaoxing] held the ukulele and forced a smile.
1:17:3|1:17:11|She brought [Lin Chong] to the basement, and in [Lin Chong]'s eyes, there was an excitement and joy that could not be concealed.
1:17:14|1:17:23|[Lin Chong] ran down the stairs excitedly and stood in the center of the basement, looking around. Posters of bands were plastered everywhere, and in front of him was a drum set.
1:17:28|1:17:31|[Lin Chong] excitedly tapped out a rhythm, then looked at [Lu Xiaoxing] with a smile.
1:17:31|1:17:44|[Lu Xiaoxing] looked melancholic, standing quietly by the stairs. Upon seeing this, [Lin Chong] quickly set aside the drumstick and stood in front of [Liang Cong], lighting a match and then three incense sticks. He respectfully bowed three times towards the photo of [Liang Cong].
1:18:10|1:18:19|[Lin Chong] looked at [Lu Xiaoxing] with concern, unable to respond for a moment. At this moment, [Lu Li] and [Jingkuang] also arrived at the Fuhua Mountain Villa. A single street lamp illuminated the entrance of the villa.
1:18:19|1:18:33|Appearing particularly eerie, [Lu Li] and [Jingkuang] got out of the car and looked cautiously towards the villa where everything seemed dark and deserted, as if no one had been there for a long time. The two of them skillfully climbed over the courtyard wall, leaped into the yard, [Lu Li] rubbed his knee, and then pulled out a handgun from his pocket.
1:18:33|1:18:40|[Jingkuang] immediately took out a gun and looked around vigilantly, then took off the decorative glasses and put them into his pocket, following behind [Lu Li].
1:18:40|1:18:55|Lu Li and Lu Xiaoxing silently sneaked into the villa, with Lu Li tapping the window lattice cautiously in the central hall. Liang Cong immediately hid in a corner of the corridor, while Lu Li raised a flashlight to investigate the situation.
1:18:55|1:19:17|[Jingkuang] followed closely behind, holding a flashlight in his left hand and a gun in his right hand, cautiously surveying the surroundings with a crouched posture. Suddenly, [Lu Li] turned around and nodded at him, [Jingkuang] nodded in agreement, then turned to check the other side. [Lu Li] took a few more steps forward, scanning a row of bookshelves. The bookshelves were filled with Tang Zheng's trophies and photos. [Lu Li] reached out and picked up a photo frame, showing a pair of siblings aged seven or eight, both holding up a trophy. He furrowed his brow and examined it closely for a long time.
1:19:17|1:19:29|Carefully placing the photo frame back in place, on the other side [Jingkuang] arrived at a staircase leading downwards. He used a flashlight to scan the surroundings continuously, carefully stepping down the stairs. Soon, the large iron door of the basement came into view.
1:19:29|1:19:32|[Jingkuang] cautiously used his mouth to hold the flashlight and fumbled to unlock.
1:19:32|1:19:56|At this moment, [Lu Li] quietly pushed open a door, walking forward cautiously with a flashlight scanning around. Suddenly, he stared in one direction for a while, fumbling to turn on the switch. The light came on, [Lu Li] frowned and scanned around, his gaze fixed ahead. In front of him was a Golf 6. [Lu Li] relaxed his brows, couldn't help but smile. He opened a cabinet, and a pile of license plates fell out.
1:19:58|1:20:3|[Lu Li] focused on the license plate, waved back, the figure behind did not argue, and walked slowly towards [Lu Li].
1:20:3|1:20:13|[Lu Li] suddenly sensed something was wrong. He turned around and saw Tang Zheng. [Lu Li] had just stood up when Tang Zheng kicked him against the wall. [Lu Li] raised his gun, but was subdued by Tang Zheng and once again slammed into the wall.
1:20:13|1:20:20|Soon after, Tang Zheng threw [Lu Li] to the ground.
1:20:23|1:20:32|[Lu Li] took a wrench from Tang Zheng, hugged his waist tightly, and was pushed several meters away by Tang Zheng before pouncing on him again. [Lu Li] then seized Tang Zheng's arm and performed a shoulder throw.
1:20:32|1:20:55|He lunged at Tang Zheng and wrestled with him again, even breaking the beads. Tang Zheng, unwilling to show weakness, flipped over and threw a punch at [Lu Li]. [Lu Li] blocked with one hand and forcefully pressed Tang Zheng against the shelf. Tang Zheng fiercely flipped over again, throwing [Lu Li] to the other side. Then he grabbed a piece of chain, put it around [Lu Li]'s neck, and pulled back hard. [Lu Li] instantly couldn't breathe, frantically spinning around the shelf.
1:20:55|1:21:6|The structure suddenly collapsed, trapping Tang Zheng underneath. [Lu Li] gasped for breath, took off the iron chain around his neck, and pounced again. In desperation, Tang Zheng grabbed a wrench nearby and swung it at [Lu Li]'s knee, who endured the pain.
1:21:6|1:21:15|Lu Li grabbed the rushing Tang Zheng, threw him to the ground, lifted him up by the collar, made him kneel on the ground, and twisted his arm behind his back.
1:21:18|1:21:30|Unexpectedly, Tang Zheng suddenly pulled out a surgical knife and stabbed it into [Lu Li] with force, causing fresh blood to gush out from his abdomen. Tang Zheng's face twisted with a hint of sadistic pleasure as [Lu Li] used all his strength to push Tang Zheng to the ground, before himself collapsing weakly on the ground.
1:21:30|1:21:40|Tang Zheng glared fiercely at [Lu Li], struggling to stand up. With blood all over his hands covering his arm, he walked up to [Lu Li], who was clutching his abdomen, trying to stay strong, and stared at Tang Zheng with gritted teeth.
1:21:40|1:21:58|As the aftereffects of blood loss worsened, Lu Li's vision of Tang Zheng became increasingly blurred. Tang Zheng slowly squatted in front of Lu Li, his widened eyes looking terrifying. He stared straight at Lu Li without any disguise, a twisted smile hanging on his lips. Lu Li's gaze gradually became unfocused, and he could no longer support himself as his body slowly leaned back.
1:21:58|1:22:4|Tang Zheng's face became increasingly blurred, and finally Lu Li closed his eyes without any awareness, tilting his head to one side.
1:22:4|1:22:17|At this moment, [Jingkuang] was completely unaware of [Lu Li]'s situation. He finally unlocked the iron chain, pushed open the iron door, rushed into the basement. It was pitch black inside, with extremely low visibility. [Jingkuang] held a gun in one hand and a flashlight in the other, cautiously moving closer with his body sideways.
1:22:17|1:22:26|Upon seeing three girls lying on the hospital bed with their faces wrapped like zongzi, [Jingkuang] cautiously approached to feel their pulses, then he raised the flashlight and scanned the surroundings vigilantly.
1:22:26|1:22:49|Suddenly, a green button in the corner of the wall caught his attention. [Jingkuang] tentatively pressed it and heard the sound of mechanical operation in his ear. Surprisingly, a secret chamber door opened. As he looked closer, what he saw left him stunned. Inside the dark chamber sat three girls with unclear consciousness, all connected to IV drips. In the middle, there was a photo frame. Upon closer inspection, he realized that the three girls and the girl in the photo frame, Tang Qian, looked exactly the same.
1:22:58|1:23:6|[Lin Chong] picked up Liang Cong's ukulele from the sofa, holding it for a while before walking outside with a smile. At that moment, Lu Xiaoxing was sitting on a chair next to the sculpture.
1:23:6|1:23:13|Upon hearing the sound of the qin, she couldn't help but sit up straight.
1:24:0|1:24:6|[Lin Chong] sat down next to [Lu Xiaoxing] while playing the guitar inside the car.
1:24:6|1:24:13|The sudden vibration of the phone interrupted the atmosphere between the two, [Lin Chong] leaned against the foot of Youkerili, took out the phone in surprise.
1:24:18|1:24:41|Lin Chong and Lu Xiaoxing exchanged a smile before quickly replying to the message. At this moment, Lu Li's phone was in Tang Zheng's hand. With one hand on the steering wheel, he looked at the phone screen with a smile. There was also a black bucket on the front passenger seat. Once he got the exact location, Tang Zheng's smile became even more reckless. He casually threw Lu Li's phone out of the window as he drove away, leaving dust behind. At the same time, the police and ambulances had arrived at Fuhua Villa.
1:24:58|1:25:24|At this moment, with pouring rain outside, a series of footprints appeared inside the Blue Lake Villa. The footprints led all the way to the center of the living room, carrying a lot of mud and sand that were completely mismatched with the luxurious marble floor. Following the footprints to the end, only a pair of black leather shoes was seen standing by the wall, gently placing a black bucket down. With his left hand holding a ballet music box, he used his right hand to lift the white cloth covering the piano keys. At this moment, Lu Xiaoxing felt his way into the living room, reaching for the sofa frame and then feeling his way down to find the shoulder bag.
1:25:24|1:25:46|Upon hearing the piano playing, Lu Xiaoxing carefully stood up and walked towards the piano, unaware that her bag suddenly opened and her phone slipped onto the carpet. Tang Zheng sat in front of the piano, expressionless, pressing the keys as Lin Chong. Lu Xiaoxing, feeling the wall, slowly walked towards the piano.
1:25:52|1:25:58|Tang Zheng played with the music box without turning around, and [Lu Xiaoxing] nervously took a step back.
1:26:21|1:26:28|[Lu Xiaoxing] frowned, seemingly lost in thought. [Tang Zheng] nodded knowingly, stood up, and [Lu Xiaoxing] hastily took several steps back upon hearing a noise.
1:26:28|1:26:36|[Tang Zheng] walked towards [Lu Xiaoxing] with a smirk, causing [Lu Xiaoxing] to stumble backwards as she was tripped by [Jingkuang].
1:26:58|1:27:3|[Lin Chong] inadvertently walked into the living room and lunged towards [Tang Zheng], only to be thrown aside.
1:27:12|1:27:33|[Lu Xiaoxing] hurriedly felt her way upstairs, [Tang Zheng] angrily grabbed [Lin Chong] by the collar and punched him to the ground. Turning towards [Lu Xiaoxing], [Lin Chong] in a panic, recklessly tackled [Tang Zheng] to the ground, blocking the staircase. [Tang Zheng] grabbed [Lin Chong] by the collar and threw him onto the bar counter, while [Lu Xiaoxing] reached for her bag by the sofa in a hurry, frantically searching for her phone, but she couldn't find it no matter how hard she tried, as the phone had fallen in a different direction.
1:27:33|1:27:55|[Tang Zheng] once again took out the scalpel and stabbed into [Lin Chong]'s abdomen. He looked at [Lin Chong] ruthlessly, stabbing the knife further in. Just as [Tang Zheng] was about to throw [Lin Chong] out, he didn't expect [Lin Chong] to muster up some strength. He grabbed the knife with one hand, refusing to let go, and held onto his shoulder with the other hand. [Tang Zheng] angrily grabbed [Lin Chong]'s neck, exerting so much force that [Lin Chong] rolled his eyes back. Then, he tossed [Lin Chong] aside like throwing out garbage.
1:27:55|1:28:0|Crossing over, [Lin Chong] walked towards the stairs, frowning with eyes barely open. Subsequently
1:28:0|1:28:12|[Tang Sengzheng] whistled as he leisurely walked up the spiral staircase, [Lu Xiaoxing] startled and sat up straight upon hearing the noise. Instead of searching for her phone, she grabbed her shoulder bag and pulled out an alarm.
1:28:12|1:28:23|Shortly after, [Lu Xiaoxing] staggered to his feet and stumbled into [Liang Cong]'s room, while [Tang Zheng] had already walked into the living room. [Lu Xiaoxing] fumbled around on [Liang Cong]'s table, picked up a tuning fork, as [Tang Zheng] calmly walked to the sofa.
1:28:23|1:28:43|Picking up Lu Xiaoxing's phone, Lu Xiaoxing squatted by the wall and felt around. After finding the socket, she inserted the tuning fork into the socket, causing a short circuit. The room instantly plunged into darkness. Lu Xiaoxing hurriedly threw the tuning fork aside and crawled to the other side. Tang Zheng looked pensive, raising his head to look around the dim surroundings and slowly turning to look at the stairs behind him.
1:28:43|1:28:54|[Lu Xiaoxing] was lying on the stairs with a bag slung over her shoulder. [Tang Zheng] slowly walked up the stairs and stood quietly next to the bag for a while. He looked around the dark surroundings again, and then took out a cigarette box from his pocket, unhurriedly.
1:28:54|1:29:1|Lighting a cigarette with a lighter, he took a puff without extinguishing the lighter.
1:29:1|1:29:4|He raised it and continued to walk slowly upwards.
1:29:4|1:29:8|In Lu Xiaoxing's opinion, this cat-and-mouse game is the most interesting.
1:29:8|1:29:20|At this moment, [Lu Xiaoxing] crouched in a dark area, carefully listening to the sounds outside, while [Tang Zheng] stepped onto the final step quietly, holding a cigarette in one hand and a lighter in the other.
1:29:20|1:29:22|Casually strolling in the corridor.
1:29:22|1:29:33|[Tang Zheng] quickly found his position, took a deep drag of his cigarette and threw it to the ground. He walked straight towards [Liang Cong]'s bedroom, each step powerful as if deliberately reminding [Lu Xiaoxing].
1:29:33|1:29:38|[Lu Xiaoxing] also felt the approach of [Tang Zheng], holding a lighter in hand standing at the door of the room.
1:29:38|1:29:46|He first looked around, then leisurely strolled into [Liang Cong]'s bedroom, where the furnishings could be vaguely seen in the moonlight.
1:29:46|1:29:57|[Tang Zheng] took a few steps forward, holding up a lighter to carefully scan the bedroom with the flickering flame. Suddenly, his gaze stopped at the window, and [Tang Zhen] walked expressionlessly to the window and extinguished the lighter.
1:29:57|1:30:3|Suddenly opening the window and looking down, seizing the opportunity, [Lu Xiaoxing] quietly pushed open the wardrobe door and moved to the doorway.
1:30:3|1:30:17|At this moment, Tang Zheng was unaware of what was happening behind him. He casually took out Lu Xiaoxing's phone from his pocket and threw it out of the window. Lu Xiaoxing took the opportunity to slip out of Liang Cong's bedroom, feeling her way along the wall and hurriedly walking forward. Tang Zheng closed the window and turned around thoughtfully.
1:30:17|1:30:35|While [Lu Xiaoxing] was walking in the corridor, the route in her mind appeared, and suddenly a man's shadow appeared near the door in her mind, causing her to stagger back several steps in fear. The sound behind her suddenly made her turn her head alertly. At this moment, Tang Zheng was pushing open the wardrobe door and raising a lighter to check inside.
1:30:35|1:30:41|[Lu Xiaoxing] seemed to feel the fire in front of her, and the man in front of her disappeared. She gathered her courage and continued to walk forward.
1:30:41|1:30:53|A long trail of blood cuts across half of the living room. [Lin Chong] is gasping for breath as he crawls desperately forward. His phone is placed on the coffee table not far ahead. [Lin Chong] looks at it in despair, then collapses weakly to the ground.
1:30:53|1:31:3|Tang Zhen pushed open a sliding door, stopped at the doorway to investigate, and suddenly the alarm sound made Tang Zheng's face change instantly. He looked fierce and ran towards the direction of the alarm with his legs.
1:31:3|1:31:15|After circling around the huge mansion for several rounds, he finally arrived at the location of the alarm. He saw an alarm device plugged next to the bathtub, and [Lu Xiaoxing], who had set up the alarm, quietly slipped out of the bathroom. Tang Zheng had just pulled the alarm device off the edge of the bathtub.
1:31:15|1:31:34|[Lu Xiaoxing] pushed a cabinet from outside the door, blocking the bathroom door. Tang Zheng then realized this and angrily threw the alarm, trying to open the bathroom door. The door was firmly blocked by a shelf outside, making it impossible to kick the door open for a while. Xiaoxing hurriedly searched downstairs. At this moment, [Jingkuang] rushed into the garage of Fuhua Mountain Villa and finally saw the unconscious [Lu Li].
1:31:57|1:32:4|[Lin Chong] lay unconscious in front of the coffee table, while [Lu Xiaoxing] fumbled her way to the French window to open it, only to find that Tang Zheng had already tied an iron chain to it.
1:32:4|1:32:20|Tang Zheng was still angrily kicking the door, but couldn't get it open. [Lu Xiaoxing] then felt her way up the stairs to try to open the main door, only to find it tightly locked by Tang Zheng as well. With each kick, the structure outside loosened gradually, and soon he could stick half of his head out.
1:32:46|1:33:9|The police car roared towards the home of [Lu Xiaoxing], [Lu Xiaoxing] anxiously felt around and suddenly tripped over something, falling to the ground. She reached out and touched [Lin Chong]'s body, [Lu Xiaoxing] was shocked and quickly pressed her cheek against [Lin Chong]. Tang Zheng, sweating profusely from pushing the door, exerted more force to push the frame out a bit more. Finally, he squeezed out of the bathroom and rushed outside. [Lu Xiaoxing] used all her strength to help [Lin Chong] sit up, while Tang Zheng circled around several times.
1:33:9|1:33:32|Having just found the staircase, [Lu Xiaoxing] struggled to drag the unconscious [Lin Chong] towards the direction of the stairs. Tang Zhen's footsteps were getting closer, and [Lu Xiaoxing] managed to drag [Lin Chong] to a room near the staircase. Upon seeing the two, Tang Zheng paused for a moment, then his expression turned even more sinister. He quickened his pace, but [Lu Xiaoxing] managed to put [Lin Chong] aside and crawled towards the door before Tang Zheng could reach them. Tang Seng, unable to catch [Lu Xiaoxing], angrily pounded on the door.
1:33:40|1:33:46|[Lin Chong]'s phone rang again. Tang Zheng walked to the coffee table, picked up the phone and slammed it to the ground. At this moment, [Lu Xiaoxing] knelt beside [Lin Chong], trembling as she tried to give [Lin Chong] mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
1:33:48|1:33:57|[Lin Chong] suddenly felt a dampness on his fingertips, and when he sniffed it, he was shocked. He quickly crawled to the shelf and took out the first aid kit.
1:33:57|1:34:11|Taking out a white bottle from the middle, [Lu Xiaoxing] carefully opened it and sniffed it. Just as [Lu Xiaoxing] was applying medicine to [Lin Chong], Tang Zheng outside picked up a golf club and ruthlessly swung at the door lock. With a full swing, Tang Zheng repeatedly smashed the door lock, leaving [Lu Xiaoxing] frozen in place.
1:34:12|1:34:20|The door lock was knocked open, Tang Zheng kicked open the door, looked down at the room, his face grim, and stepped slowly into the room.
1:34:20|1:34:26|With a cue stick in one hand and a lighter in the other, [Lu Xiaoxing] tried to light it several times, but still couldn't produce a flame.
1:34:26|1:34:48|Tang Zheng cautiously walked forward, closing the lighter lid. He held the baseball bat in the most handy position, carefully surveyed the room, but couldn't see the figures of the two people. Tang Zheng's gaze stopped at the curtain, he pursed his lips and stepped forward to pull open the curtain. There was nothing behind the curtain, suddenly [Lu Xiaoxing] emerged from beside the bookshelf, holding a pair of scissors.
1:34:49|1:34:59|[Lu Xiaoxing] tightly held the scissors, looking confusedly ahead and waving them around randomly. This scene piqued Tang Seng's interest, as he stood by [Lu Xiaoxing]'s side and lightly tapped her shoulder with a baseball bat. [Lu Xiaoxing] still held the scissors in her hand.
1:34:59|1:35:5|Panic-stricken, Lu Xiaoxing thrusts towards Tang Zheng, one hand tightly gripping the bookshelf behind him, while Tang Zheng pokes at the other side of Lu Xiaoxing's shoulder with a baseball bat.
1:35:5|1:35:16|[Lu Xiaoxing] panickedly waved the scissors and felt her way back against the wall, while Tang Zhenzheng noticed [Lin Chong] hidden behind the bookshelf. His brows suddenly furrowed as if he was about to wake up, and Tang Zhenzheng forced [Lu Xiaoxing] into the living room.
1:35:16|1:35:35|From time to time, [Lin Chong] would tap on the wall to provoke [Lu Xiaoxing]. Suddenly, he threw the pool cue aside and rushed forward to grab [Lu Xiaoxing]'s hand, then he grabbed her neck from behind. [Lu Xiaoxing] twisted his hand, threw [Tang Zheng] over his shoulder and onto the ground. While [Tang Zheng] was still trying to get up, [Lu Xiaoxing] hurriedly felt her way to the bar counter, then she picked up an iron bucket from the counter and turned towards the other side.
1:35:35|1:35:44|[Tang Zheng]'s originally injured arm was hurting even more, and it took him a while to struggle to get up before quickly catching up.
1:35:50|1:36:2|[Lu Xiaoxing] lit a match and held it up in front of [Tang Zheng], the iron bucket continuously pouring out liquid, causing [Tang Zheng] to be truly shocked and terrified. [Lu Xiaoxing] raised the match forward, leaving [Tang Zheng] frozen on the side, never expecting the entire bucket of gasoline to be poured all over himself.
1:36:2|1:36:8|[Tang Zheng] chuckled self-deprecatingly and grinned at [Lu Xiaoxing].
1:36:22|1:36:27|[Tang Zheng] looked angrily at the gasoline dripping on [Lu Xiaoxing], he took a few steps back and gently raised his toes.
1:36:35|1:36:56|[Tang Zheng] reluctantly reached into his pocket and accidentally kicked a drum set in the distance. He turned his eyes to [Lu Xiaoxing], who held up the key and shook it gently in front of her. [Lu Xiaoxing] tilted her head slightly to carefully discern the direction. Suddenly, [Tang Zheng] threw the key far away. [Lu Xiaoxing] hurried to grab the key, holding a match in one hand and fumbling for direction with the other. And as the match burned down to the end...
1:36:56|1:36:58|It went out again.
1:36:59|1:37:18|When the match lit up again, [Tang Zheng] raised the drum rack and smashed it towards [Lu Xiaoxing], only to hit the glass in front of him. The match in [Lu Xiaoxing]'s hand fell to the ground in the chaos, and the fire slowly spread, catching [Tang Zheng]'s arm. [Lu Xiaoxing] hurriedly searched on the ground and quickly found the key. By this time, flames had engulfed [Tang Zheng]'s whole body, and he struggled in the fire without time to care for [Lu Xiaoxing].
1:37:18|1:37:24|[Lu Xiaoxing] groped her way up the stairs, leaving [Liang Cong]'s photo there, silently blessing her sister.
1:37:24|1:37:36|The sprinkler started spraying water quickly, easing the fire. [Lu Xiaoxing] rushed out of the basement in a panic and locked the door. Walking along the wall, [Tang Zheng] suddenly emerged from the fire scene and caught up with [Lu Xiaoxing] in just a few steps, grabbing her clothes from behind.
1:37:36|1:37:59|He forcefully threw her onto the bar counter. Tang Zhen's half face was severely burned by the fire, looking terrifying. He staggered forward and dragged [Lu Xiaoxing] up, slapping her down to the ground. Relentlessly, he continued to beat [Lu Xiaoxing] without mercy, causing her to crash into the glass and fall to the ground. Tang Zheng, with his burnt wrist, stumbled and collapsed by the piano. Meanwhile, [Lu Xiaoxing] struggled to prop herself up and slowly crawled towards the exit.
1:37:59|1:38:11|Tang Zheng once again became obsessed, staring infatuatedly at the music box on the piano. After a long time, he tremblingly reached out his hand, carefully touching the protective cover. He slowly picked up the music box and walked menacingly towards [Lu Xiaoxing].
1:38:11|1:38:22|At this moment, [Lu Xiaoxing] was still struggling to climb outward with both arms, Tang Zheng held the music box in front of his eyes, watching the slowly moving [Lu Xiaoxing] through the music and protective cover. His expression was distracted, showing signs of mental collapse.
1:38:22|1:38:38|[Lu Xiaoxing] reached out with both hands, feeling and crawling, suddenly touching the vibrating guide detector her mother bought for her. But at this moment, Tang Zheng had already stood behind [Lu Xiaoxing]. He half-knelt beside [Lu Xiaoxing], firmly pressing her shoulders, and effortlessly turned [Lu Xiaoxing] over, pinching her neck.
1:38:43|1:38:47|Tang Zheng, with a crazy expression, has already mistaken Lu Xiaoxing for his sister Tang Qian.
1:38:55|1:39:15|[Lu Xiaoxing] was choked and couldn't breathe. His expression was scattered, Tang Zheng stared at [Lu Xiaoxing] tightly, his grip getting stronger. [Lu Xiaoxing] weakly raised his hand and pounded Tang Zheng's chest a few times, then furrowed his brow, closed his eyes tightly. Suddenly, Tang Zheng tilted his head to one side, with [Lin Chong] standing behind him holding a baseball bat tightly. He held his stomach in pain and helped [Lu Xiaoxing] to the edge of the bar.
1:39:18|1:39:24|[Lu Xiaoxing] opened her eyes dazedly, and [Lin Chong] placed her hand on his own face.
1:39:27|1:39:32|[Lu Xiaoxing] hurriedly took out a bunch of keys from his pocket and stuffed them into [Lin Chong]'s hand.
1:39:34|1:39:47|[Lin Chong] looked at the key in his hand in astonishment, then glanced at the French window. He lowered his head and placed one of [Lu Xiaoxing]'s hands on his shoulder, then turned towards the French window. With the key in hand, he quickly unlocked the iron chain with a few clicks.
1:39:49|1:40:8|Come on, [Lin Chong] helped [Lu Xiaoxing], who was almost unconscious, to get up. But they found Tang Zheng struggling to stand up. [Lin Chong] hurriedly helped [Lu Xiaoxing] up and pushed open the French window to run outside. Tang Zheng, with his hand on the wall, roared and lunged towards the window. [Lin Chong] quickly turned back to close the window, but was pushed aside by Tang Zheng. [Lu Xiaoxing] was thrown onto a nearby table. [Lin Chong] and Tang Zheng fell into the swimming pool.
1:40:16|1:40:20|[Lin Chong] got up and lunged at Tang Zheng again, who grabbed [Lin Chong]'s arm and threw him into the rain.
1:40:37|1:40:45|On the other side, tied up in the car, the helpless and roaring Liang Cong, Lu Xiaoxing, seemed to be back at the scene of the car accident years ago.
1:40:58|1:41:11|[Lu Xiaoxing] stood up with one hand on the ground, as if it were the same posture as when she forced herself up after the car accident years ago. [Lu Xiaoxing] walked forward a few steps with a dazed look on her face, then fell down again.
1:41:11|1:41:20|But she didn't give up, still struggling to crawl forward, [Lu Xiaoxing]'s hand groping on the ground, suddenly touching the tourist guide she bought for [Liang Cong].
1:41:20|1:41:27|This seemed to give Lu Xiaoxing endless strength as she held the ukulele tightly in her arms and stood up again.
1:41:34|1:41:47|Tang Zheng seemed tireless as he lifted [Lin Chong] out of the water and punched him in the face repeatedly. Meanwhile, in her memory, [Lu Xiaoxing] walked to the front of the car, with [Liang Cong] placing both hands on the passenger seat handle, her eyes still filled with fear and despair.
1:41:47|1:42:2|[Lu Xiaoxing] looked at her brother in the car with tears streaming down her face. She trembled as she reached out her hand to gently touch the window, while the other hand tightly gripped the door handle. She desperately tried to pull the door open, but it wouldn't budge. She then started banging on the window, unsure of what else she could do.
1:42:2|1:42:12|At this moment, it seems that crying is the only thing she can do. She howls, unwillingly grabs the car door handle, but it still has no effect. She weakly taps on the car window, in pain and despair.
1:42:13|1:42:21|[Lin Chong] was thrown to the ground and then lunged at Tang Zheng's calf. Just as he had knocked Tang Zheng to the ground, he was kicked by Tang Zheng into the rainwater. [Lu Xiaoxing] was still immersed in memories.
1:42:21|1:42:27|He helplessly leaned against the car window, not knowing what to do next.
1:42:27|1:42:32|The memory of [Liang Cong] is still very clear, looking at her with tears in her eyes.
1:42:36|1:42:46|Since childhood, he has always been encouraged by [Liang Cong], and now, [Lu Xiaoxing] slowly stands up against the wall. He opens his eyes and once again sees the clear face of [Liang Cong] in his memory.
1:42:46|1:42:55|[Liang Cong] had no despair or panic in his eyes, only endless encouragement and gratitude. He nodded to [Lu Xiaoxing], as if telling her, "You can do it."
1:42:55|1:43:1|His smile finally helped [Lu Xiaoxing] move on from the past, and she turned resolutely towards Tang Zheng.
1:43:6|1:43:26|Tang Zheng pushed Lin Chong into the water, then angrily walked towards Lu Xiaoxing. Lin Chong struggled in the water, trying to stop Tang Zheng, but he was too exhausted to do so and eventually fell into the water. Tang Zheng walked out of the pool, took out a surgical knife from his pocket, and quietly approached Lu Xiaoxing, who was standing quietly next to a sculpture.
1:43:30|1:43:38|The surrounding noise was too loud, greatly affecting Lu Xiaoxing's judgment. She closed her eyes to determine Tang Zheng's direction.
1:43:41|1:43:52|With the vibration of the guide detector in her hand, [Lu Xiaoxing] already had Tang Zheng's exact location in her mind. The image of the man in front of her became clearer and clearer, and he slowly approached her with a grim expression.
1:43:52|1:44:9|[Lu Xiaoxing] still kept her eyes closed, listening attentively with her guide cane held tightly. The frequency of the vibrations of the guide cane increased, and at this moment, Tang Zheng couldn't hold back his anger, rushing towards her with a surgical knife in hand. The figure in his mind drew closer, and [Lu Xiaoxing] clearly felt him charging towards her, raising the knife. Suddenly, [Lu Xiaoxing] opened her eyes wide.
1:44:9|1:44:17|With all her might, Lu Xiaoxing swung the ukulele over, the man in her mind instantly turned into ashes, while in reality, Lu Xiaoxing knocked Tang Zheng unconscious.
1:44:17|1:44:24|She relaxed and collapsed to her knees on the ground, while [Lin Chong] finally climbed out of the pool and breathed a sigh of relief as he knelt down.
1:44:24|1:44:31|The siren blared, and Lu Xiaoxing knew she was saved. Several police cars with flashing lights roared into the villa.
1:44:31|1:44:39|[Lu Xiaoxing] couldn't hold on and started to lean backwards slightly, while the mastermind Tang Zheng lay unconscious on the side, awaiting his judgment by justice.
1:44:39|1:44:45|Looking at [Lu Xiaoxing], [Lin Chong] smiled.
1:44:47|1:44:56|The police successfully arrived at the scene, and both [Lu Xiaoxing] were rescued.
1:44:58|1:45:3|This is a large concert scene, with a photo of [Liang Cong] playing on the stage screen, and the organizer of the concert standing on the stage.
1:45:4|1:45:11|They are all former band members of [Liang Cong], with glow sticks waving in the audience holding banners and signs with the band's name on stage.
1:45:48|1:45:57|The stage lights suddenly flickered, the rhythm changed, making the previously gentle atmosphere instantly lively.
1:45:57|1:46:5|The stage background suddenly turned into a galaxy of stars, with the audience below in darkness, only able to see the glow sticks of the fans flickering, while the guitarist skillfully strummed the strings.
1:46:5|1:46:15|The audience below is filled with banners that say "I love you, North Star", and at this moment, a figure in black walks onto the stage, instantly quieting the entire venue.
