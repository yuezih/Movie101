0:1:14|0:1:23|The story begins with a wooden board full of nails. The female protagonist [Zhang Yu] is sitting on the sofa, looking at the wooden board on the ground, then looking up at the man in front of her.
0:2:3|0:2:11|[Zhang Yu] gestured with her hand. When her ex-husband [Zhu Ziqiang] saw it, he gritted his teeth, closed his eyes, and knelt on the nail board.
0:5:0|0:5:13|[Zhang Yu] hesitated for a moment, unsure of how to respond, facing the vast Seven Mile Sea in front of her, while the opera performance continued on the other side.
0:5:30|0:5:36|The minister of vows' opera resounded, taking out a pen and handing it to the actor playing the emperor.
0:6:29|0:6:31|Inside the ancient architectural Wenchang Palace on the other side.
0:6:49|0:7:2|The auntie cleaning in the Wenchang Palace, after shooing away the children urinating everywhere with a broom, returned to her work area.
0:7:2|0:7:5|Before long, a middle-aged man carrying luggage walked in from outside the door.
0:9:42|0:9:52|Call [Big Ears], call [Zhu Ziqiang] over to his side.
0:9:52|0:9:56|When Big Ears took out the ring, Zhu Ziqiang reached out and twisted her ear.
0:11:15|0:11:20|Big Ears, holding something, heard it and turned around to throw the thing in his hand towards Liu Cuixia.
0:11:31|0:11:35|Liu Dapao left without saying a word, which was scorned by Liu Cuixia.
0:11:35|0:11:41|After unzipping the luggage, she took a look at the contents inside and then left while holding the luggage.
0:11:41|0:11:46|Inside the Wenchang Palace, a man wearing sunglasses and a windbreaker happened to overhear the conversation between Zhang Yu and Zhu Ziqiang.
0:11:55|0:12:1|He repeated the key words he had just heard, a smile on his face that was hard to decipher.
0:12:1|0:12:7|[Zhu Ziqiang] and [Zhang Yu] discussed remarrying, and once they got home, they started rummaging through boxes and cabinets.
0:12:7|0:12:12|He took out a wooden box from the depths of the wardrobe with both hands.
0:12:52|0:13:3|[Zhu Ziqiang], who didn't steal the secret formula, had to leave home.
0:13:22|0:13:29|The person who is talking nonsense turns out to be the man in a windbreaker inside the Wenchang Palace.
0:13:29|0:13:34|He, who behaved strangely, arrived at the ecological park of [Zhang Yu].
0:13:45|0:13:55|Outside the gate, a car suddenly arrived. The security guard in uniform immediately stood at the entrance, waiting for the car to stop in front of him before opening the back door.
0:14:10|0:14:14|Upon hearing a familiar voice, [Zhang Yu] turned around to look at the man collecting junk.
0:14:14|0:14:20|The man saw [Zhang Yu] turn around and raised his hand to take off the messy wig on top of his head.
0:14:20|0:14:23|On the other side, [Big Ears] caught up with [Zhu Meimei].
0:15:7|0:15:9|Zhu Meimei heard [Big Ears] say this.
0:15:9|0:15:27|With a disdainful look, the ragged man finished bathing in the room, and someone outside handed her clothes. She took the clothes through the crack in the door. Who would have thought that the person delivering the clothes outside the door was [Zhang Yu]. Inside the ecological park, several service staff were carrying food and clear wine.
0:15:27|0:15:30|Zhu Meimei happened to see this scene while driving a sightseeing car.
0:15:30|0:15:32|Zhu Meimei stood still, lost in thought.
0:16:10|0:16:12|Later.
0:16:47|0:16:52|At this moment, Zhong Meimei outside the house happened to see Zhang Yu feeding eggs to Chen Xiaobai.
0:18:16|0:18:44|Chen Xiaobai, you are still so spirited, so confident. This is the real you, Chen Xiaobai. [Zhu Meimei] and [Zhu Ziqiang] couldn't help but rush into the room. Let me introduce, this is [Zhu Ziqiang], the crab farming expert at Crab Garden. And this is his sister, named [Zhu Meimei], the receptionist and tour guide at our Qilihai Ecological Resort.
0:18:45|0:18:46|[Zhang Yu] winked, hoping that [Zhu Ziqiang] wouldn't reveal their relationship.
0:18:46|0:18:47|Chen Xiaobai realized the awkward atmosphere and put on his coat.
0:18:47|0:18:48|[Zhu Ziqiang] gritted his teeth and pursed his lips. Suddenly, he noticed the coat on Chen Xiaobai and snorted coldly.
0:19:23|0:19:26|Such an awkward situation left [Zhang Yu] at a loss for what to do.
0:19:38|0:19:46|[Zhu Ziqiang] quickly covered up when he saw [Zhang Yu] walking out, leaving Chen Xiaobai and Zhu Meimei in the room.
0:21:28|0:21:29|[Zhang Yu] looked at [Zhu Ziqiang], then suddenly lifted his foot.
0:21:29|0:21:31|[Zhu Ziqiang] thought [Zhang Yu] was going to kick him, but it turned out she was just scaring him.
0:23:15|0:23:22|Chen Xiaobai made an impassioned speech, inspiring Zhu Meimei and [Big Ears] behind him to applaud.
0:23:22|0:23:30|Having been humiliated by [Zhu Ziqiang] at the detention center, [Zhang Yu] returned home and hid outside the front door, quietly observing his own courtyard.
0:23:30|0:23:39|In the courtyard, he saw his father Zhu Dapao stepping on a bamboo ladder, carefully placing the wooden box containing the secret recipe for harmony noodles behind the air conditioner unit.
0:23:42|0:23:52|After Father Pig Cannon left, [Zhu Ziqiang] brought a bamboo ladder, looked around cautiously, and then, after making sure it was safe, he took out the box hidden behind the air conditioner.
0:23:52|0:23:57|After holding it in his hand for a while, he then tucked the box under the leaves and quickly left home.
0:23:57|0:24:9|He arrived at the field in the countryside, hiding among the piles of wheat straw around. With a hammer and an iron rod, he unlocked the lock on the box, then picked up the box and slowly opened the lid.
0:24:11|0:24:20|The contents inside the box were wrapped in a piece of cloth. After [Zhu Ziqiang] looked around to make sure no one was watching, he lowered his head and opened the cloth.
0:24:36|0:24:43|[Zhu Ziqiang] opens a layer of cloth, inside there is another layer, repeatedly, one piece of cloth wrapping another piece of cloth.
0:24:43|0:24:50|[Zhu Ziqiang] painstakingly dismantled layer by layer, feeling more uneasy the further he went, but still continued to dismantle.
0:24:50|0:24:54|After dismantling many layers, a piece of paper finally appeared inside.
0:24:54|0:24:59|[Zhu Ziqiang] excitedly opened the note, inside were four words: "Mess with you, play with you."
0:25:2|0:25:16|Upon seeing these words, the smile on [Zhu Ziqiang]'s face instantly disappeared. He held the note in his hands and stood up with a mix of laughter and tears on his face.
0:26:24|0:26:29|[Big Ears] pours a glass of wine for Chen Xiaobai.
0:26:50|0:26:57|After speaking, Chen Xiaobai and [Big Ears] raised their glasses, clinked them together, and then each drank it all in one go.
0:26:57|0:27:10|In the cabin, the two men were drinking and chatting. [Big Ears] kept pouring wine into Chen Xiaobai's cup. Chen Xiaobai's head gradually became heavy, supporting his head with one hand and then the other. Finally, he couldn't hold on any longer and passed out on the dining table.
0:27:21|0:27:26|[Zhang Yu] and [Big Ears] struggled to help Chen Xiaobai back to the room to rest.
0:27:31|0:27:36|She covered her eyes, held her breath, and forcefully took off the shoes under [Chen Xiaobai]'s feet.
0:27:36|0:27:40|The moment the shoe was taken off, [Zhang Yu] couldn't help but cover her nose with her hand.
0:27:44|0:27:56|[Big Ears] then took off the other shoe of [Chen Xiaobai]. After taking it off, [Big Ears] covered his eyes with the back of his hand, while [Chen Xiaobai] lying on the bed was already in a daze.
0:28:35|0:28:41|[Big Ears] gestured wildly, causing [Zhang Yu] to burst out laughing.
0:28:41|0:28:45|After Big Ears left, Zhang Yu sat down on the edge where Chen Xiaobai had been sitting.
0:29:6|0:29:8|Upon seeing [Zhu Meimei] suddenly barge in, [Zhang Yu] immediately reminded her to speak softly.
0:30:29|0:30:45|[Chen Xiaobai], lying on the bed, suddenly sat up, startling [Zhu Meimei] and [Zhang Yu]. After speaking, [Chen Xiaobai] lay back down on the bed, continuing to sleep.
0:30:45|0:30:53|[Zhang Yu] tried to pull [Zhu Meimei] out of the room, but [Zhu Meimei] refused to leave. She struggled to break free, but in the end, she couldn't resist [Zhang Yu].
0:30:53|0:30:57|Pushing each other, the two left Chen Xiaobai's bedroom.
0:30:57|0:31:4|The next morning, as the sun slowly rose, [Zhu Ziqiang] rode his old-fashioned tricycle to the entrance of the ecological park.
0:31:4|0:31:6|Just got off the car, but was stopped by the security guard.
0:32:2|0:32:7|Zhu Meimei stopped the sightseeing car and walked towards Chen Xiaobai when she saw that he didn't understand himself.
0:32:46|0:32:48|Hearing Chen Xiaobai say this.
0:32:48|0:32:53|[Zhu Meimei]'s face darkened for a moment, but she immediately smiled again.
0:33:14|0:33:17|[Zhu Meimei] nodded in agreement.
0:33:22|0:33:25|When speaking, Chen Xiaobai held [Zhu Meimei]'s hand.
0:33:37|0:33:44|Chen Xiaobai looked affectionately at Zhong Meimei and nodded.
0:33:57|0:34:3|[Zhu Ziqiang] walked into the room, and Liu Cuixia also put down the broom in her hand.
0:34:5|0:34:8|Liu Cuixia picked up the rag and started wiping the table again.
0:34:24|0:34:30|[Zhu Ziqiang] walked out of the house and turned to see the clothes he had given to Liu Cuixia last time, a smile appearing on his face again.
0:36:11|0:36:16|Chen Xiaobai reached out his left hand, then quickly extended his right hand.
0:36:46|0:37:4|After finishing talking with Chen Xiaobai, Zhu Meimei happily walked home, dancing and prancing. Lost in her joy, she accidentally bumped into [Big Ears] who was leading a donkey at the intersection.
0:37:13|0:37:17|In front of the ecological officer's gate, Chen Xiaobai and the security guard each hold a blanket and a thermos, placing them on a tricycle.
0:37:45|0:37:50|Chen Xiaobai pushed a tricycle filled with daily necessities towards the market.
0:37:50|0:37:54|[Zhang Yu] did not try to stop him, just silently watched him.
0:37:54|0:37:57|On the other side, [Zhu Meimei] walked into [Zhu Ziqiang]'s office.
0:40:3|0:40:9|[Zhu Ziqiang] stood with his hands behind his back, looking at his daughter [Zhu Meimei].
0:40:51|0:40:54|[Zhumeimei], who was kicked out of the house, could only leave nearby.
0:41:19|0:41:26|Chen Xiaobai took Big Ears' script in one hand and supported his forehead with the other, suddenly thinking of something.
0:41:43|0:41:46|Chen Xiaobai smiled and gestured confidently to win.
0:42:3|0:42:5|Chen Xiaobai excitedly hugged him.
0:43:13|0:43:15|[Zhang Yu] turned his head away, unwilling to continue the conversation with Liu Cuixia.
0:43:59|0:44:4|Next to Qili Sea, Zhang Yu is still diligently practicing the travel script.
0:44:4|0:44:8|[Zhang Yu] left his mother Liu Cuixia's house and went back home, lying down on the bed in the bedroom.
0:44:8|0:44:13|She picked up a book on the bed and flipped through it casually.
0:44:13|0:44:16|After reading a few pages, she turned to look at the bedside.
0:44:16|0:44:32|Immediately saw a figure, who did not make any movement, just slightly sat up to check on the person by the bed, then gently put down the book in hand, quickly stood up, grabbed the bamboo pole at the end of the bed, and struck towards the bedside.
0:44:54|0:45:15|Next door, the sound of a pig cannon interrupted the two. [Zhang Yu] reluctantly put away the bamboo pole and placed it back at the end of the bed. Sitting back on the bed, [he] sighed helplessly and then turned to look at [Zhu Ziqiang] standing beside him. [Zhu Ziqiang] looked at [Zhang Yu] with a mischievous smile on his face. [Zhang Yu] said to [Zhu Ziqiang], "Your dad is really annoying."
0:45:53|0:46:11|After speaking, [Zhu Ziqiang] straightened his back, twisted left and right twice, [Zhang Yu] watched [him] make a funny move and couldn't help but laugh.
0:46:11|0:46:14|[Zhu Ziqiang] sat down on the edge of the bed and was about to take off his shoes.
0:46:22|0:46:27|Upon hearing this, [Zhu Ziqiang] had to stand up again, while [Zhang Yu] secretly applauded.
0:46:27|0:46:34|[Zhu Ziqiang] saw [Zhang Yu] like this, pointed a finger at [Zhang Yu], and [Zhang Yu] smiled and lowered his head.
0:47:26|0:47:31|The next morning, [Big Ears] sat in the office with two men.
0:48:8|0:48:18|After seeing off the two men, [Big Ears] walked from the sofa to the desk, then sat on the office chair. [Zhang Yu] followed closely, standing in front of [Big Ears].
0:50:16|0:50:27|Zhu DaPao got up from his office chair while talking, and finally left the office directly. He walked around the alley in the village with his hands behind his back, and ran into Chen Xiaobai.
0:50:53|0:50:57|In the ecological park, [Zhu Meimei] is holding a tour guide flag, leading a group of tourists.
0:51:17|0:51:24|[Big Ears] folded up the dog thief and put him in his pocket.
0:51:48|0:51:54|He took out a pair of clappers from his pocket again.
0:51:54|0:52:0|[Zhu Meimei] crossed her hands in front of her chest, coldly snorting at her exaggerated posture.
0:52:43|0:52:47|The tourists on the sightseeing bus, upon hearing this, all burst into applause.
0:52:47|0:52:52|Zhu Meimei saw the situation was not good, so she immediately got on the sightseeing bus and drove away with the tourists.
0:52:52|0:52:54|At this moment, [Zhang Yu] appears behind [Big Ears].
0:53:29|0:53:37|[Big Ears] happily walked outside, while on the other side, Chen Xiaobai accompanied Zhu Dapao walking by the Qili River.
0:53:54|0:53:57|Hearing Zhu Meimei's voice, Zhu Dapao turned his head and looked at Chen Xiaobai.
0:55:10|0:55:21|Zhu Meimei brought the tourists to the film and television base.
0:55:35|0:55:52|Zhu DaPao put on the chef's uniform, placed the half-smoked cigarette on the edge of the table, put on the chef's hat, poured flour into a bowl, slowly added the right amount of water, kneaded the flour into dough, then kneaded it repeatedly until the dough formed and became smooth.
0:55:53|0:56:0|He then placed his palms on the dough, exerting pressure slowly, transforming the rough noodles into smooth and round shapes.
0:56:0|0:56:9|Zhu DaPao sprinkled a thin layer of flour on the cutting board again, and rolled the dough back and forth until it was rolled into a round thin pancake.
0:56:9|0:56:22|After rolling out the dough, lift it up and fold it into a long strip like a ladder. With a clanging sound, the dough is transformed into noodles of varying lengths. Grab them, shake them open, and toss them into the pot of boiling water.
0:56:23|0:56:31|Taking out several crabs again, they were each split in half and placed into the stone mortar with jujubes and garlic, then pounded repeatedly.
0:56:31|0:56:36|Chen Xiaobai and Zhong Weimei looked at this scene and smiled at each other.
0:56:36|0:56:39|The river crab noodles of Big Ears are still continuing.
0:56:39|0:56:46|She threw the crab she had pounded into mud into the water to cook into soup, then cut some green onions, coriander, radishes, and other side dishes.
0:56:46|0:56:50|Then add some oil to the wok, pour in the crab roe and stir-fry.
0:56:51|0:56:58|Noodles are about to be cooked, and Big Ears pulls out a small gourd from the pig cannon, sprinkling the powdery substance inside into the pot.
0:56:58|0:57:3|After a moment, quickly scoop the noodles into the bowl and pour the crab roe sauce on top.
0:57:3|0:57:6|The smoke on the edge of the table has not completely burned out at this moment.
0:57:6|0:57:13|Big Ears made a bowl of crab roe noodles.
0:57:13|0:57:17|Chen Xiaobai brought over a small bowl of crab roe noodles and leaned in to take a gentle sniff.
0:57:28|0:57:33|He couldn't help but swallow a mouthful of saliva, picked up a noodle with chopsticks and put it into his mouth.
0:57:33|0:57:38|After savoring two bites carefully, he was completely conquered by the taste of the crab roe noodles.
0:57:38|0:57:42|With his eyes closed, he felt as if he had everything.
0:57:42|0:57:46|With arms outstretched, as if standing on the shore of Qili Sea.
0:57:46|0:57:50|The sea breeze passed through his fingers, filling his nose with the fragrance of crabs.
0:57:53|0:57:58|At this moment, he felt that all his persistence for so long was not in vain.
0:57:58|0:58:5|Zhang Yu finally tasted the famous river crab noodles and also learned the secret recipe of the dish.
0:58:5|0:58:12|On the other side of the crab garden, [Zhu Ziqiang] and [Zhang Yu] were lying on the table in the courtyard, observing the crabs on the table.
0:58:12|0:58:16|[Zhu Ziqiang] suddenly spoke up.
1:0:13|1:0:18|[Zhu Ziqiang] reached out a hand to pat [Zhang Yu], but was dodged and rejected by [Zhang Yu].
1:0:43|1:0:46|On the other side, Zhang Yu had a smile on his face.
1:1:0|1:1:12|Upon hearing Zhu Meimei's words, Chen Xiaobai nodded in agreement.
1:1:12|1:1:19|Seeing [Chen Xiaobai] supporting himself with his pointed head, [Zhu Meimei] nodded somewhat reluctantly, but she had already started calculating in her heart.
1:1:21|1:1:26|When the day came, he saw Sister-in-law [Zhang Yu] answering a phone call in a hurry.
1:1:26|1:1:30|After leaving home, he dragged his brother [Zhu Ziqiang] away from home.
1:1:30|1:1:35|Dad [Zhu Dapao] saw that there was no one at home, so he decided to go out for a walk by himself.
1:1:35|1:1:42|After making sure that there was no one at home, [Zhu Meimei] quietly brought [Chen Xiaobai] into the house and locked the door.
1:1:42|1:1:45|Upon entering the room, [Chen Xiaobai] asked [Zhu Meimei].
1:1:51|1:1:53|[Zhu Meimei] thought for a moment.
1:1:57|1:2:1|[Zhu Meimei] thought about it again.
1:2:13|1:2:14|[Chen Xiaobai] had a sudden inspiration.
1:2:35|1:2:39|Zhu Meimei found it very reasonable and brought [Chen Xiaobai] to the kitchen.
1:2:42|1:2:46|After lifting the stove, they saw an iron box inside.
1:2:46|1:2:52|[Chen Xiaobai] picked up the iron box and flicked off the dust with his hand.
1:2:52|1:2:57|After carefully opening the box, he saw an old piece of paper inside.
1:2:57|1:3:1|The paper faintly reveals some words.
1:3:17|1:3:24|[Chen Xiaobai] excitedly opened the kitchen door and walked out, but as soon as he stepped out of the house, he bumped into the returning Big Ears head-on.
1:3:34|1:3:39|In the kitchen, Zhu Meimei heard the shouting and stood still.
1:3:39|1:3:43|[Chen Xiaobai] disregarded everything and ran out with the iron box containing the secret formula.
1:3:43|1:3:48|Big Ears's shouting attracted the attention of the neighbors and other villagers around.
1:3:48|1:3:53|Villagers mobilized one after another, some riding electric bikes, some holding brooms in their hands.
1:3:53|1:3:57|The adults and children are all mobilized, determined to catch [Chen Xiaobai].
1:3:57|1:4:2|Back and forth, round and round, [Chen Xiaobai] leads the villagers around the village.
1:4:3|1:4:15|Zhang Yu finally ran gasping for breath to the side of the ecological park, leaning on a farm tricycle by the road to rest for a moment. Worried that the person behind would catch up, he quickly ran behind the billboard by the road.
1:4:15|1:4:24|Not long after he hid, a group of villagers caught up from behind, but they didn't notice the billboard and continued to rush towards the main road.
1:4:24|1:4:39|After the villagers had left, [Chen Xiaobai] quickly emerged from the billboard. He watched as the villagers walked away, then looked at the agricultural tricycle on the side of the road. After circling the vehicle, he confirmed that it could be started, and then he got on.
1:4:39|1:4:45|Just as he started the car, he looked up and unexpectedly met the belated [Zhu Ziqiang] and [Zhu Meimei].
1:4:45|1:4:56|[Zhu Ziqiang] gasped as he walked slowly, with [Zhang Yu] supporting him. At this moment, the villagers also turned back, surrounding them from both sides, leaving [Big Ears] with no way to escape.
1:4:56|1:5:4|The secret formula issue has been resolved, [Zhu Dapao] is sitting in the office with his eyes closed for health preservation, with [Zhang Yu], [Zhu Ziqiang], and [Zhu Meimei] sitting in front of him.
1:5:4|1:5:9|But no one spoke, and [Zhang Yu] was the first one to become restless.
1:5:9|1:5:11|He cleared his throat and then began to speak.
1:5:20|1:5:20|Big Ears looks at Zhang Yu.
1:5:20|1:5:21|Looks at [Zhu Ziqiang] again.
1:5:21|1:5:22|No one admitted it, and Big Ears sneered twice.
1:5:22|1:5:24|Then he took out the iron box that had been recovered from [Chen Xiaobai] and asked the three of them.
1:5:53|1:5:57|After asking, he opened the iron box himself.
1:6:23|1:6:27|Shortly after, Zhang Yu, Zhu Ziqiang, and Big Ears arrived at the inn.
1:6:31|1:6:35|[Chen Xiaobai] looked at the group without saying a word, [Zhu Meimei] appeared very flustered for a moment.
1:7:38|1:7:39|[Chen Xiaobai] had a sudden inspiration.
1:7:45|1:7:49|[Chen Xiaobai] was about to stand up, but reluctantly sat back down.
1:7:49|1:7:53|[Zhang Yu] heard it and looked at the old father-in-law [Zhu Dapao] beside him.
1:8:16|1:8:22|[Zhang Yu] sighed and Big Ears understood the situation at the scene.
1:8:26|1:8:28|Zhu Ziqiang was in a dilemma when he heard the news.
1:8:36|1:8:46|Chen Xiaobai's words made the four people present look at each other in astonishment, none of them had expected that Chen Xiaobai would really stay.
1:11:2|1:11:11|Pig Cannon opened his mouth, trying to say those three words, but the words never came out when they reached his lips.
1:11:29|1:11:42|On the other side, [Big Ears] finished his business and arrived at [Zhang Yu]'s office, unable to hide the happiness on his face.
1:11:42|1:11:48|[Big Ears] took out a folder from the bag.
1:11:48|1:11:51|[Zhang Yu] took the folder and flipped through the contents inside.
1:11:53|1:11:59|After seeing what was inside, [Zhang Yu] smiled satisfactorily and gave a thumbs up to [Big Ears].
1:11:59|1:12:4|At this moment, [Zhu Ziqiang] is on the shore of the crab pond, with several workers, fishing for crabs.
1:12:24|1:12:31|[Zhu Ziqiang] hadn't finished speaking, but [Zhang Yu] had already hung up the phone.
1:12:31|1:12:32|As soon as the words were spoken, [Zhu Meimei] ran over.
1:13:5|1:13:10|[Zhu Meimei] stood stunned in place upon hearing [Zhu Ziqiang]'s words.
1:13:10|1:13:20|On the other side, [Zhu Ziqiang] arrived at the Wenchang Palace, but he didn't walk in directly. Instead, he stood at the entrance, stuck his head inside, and looked around inside from left to right.
1:13:20|1:13:23|[Liu Cuixia] happened to walk out from another door.
1:14:17|1:14:20|[Zhu Ziqiang] stuffs the phone into [Liu Cuixia]'s hand.
1:14:30|1:14:37|See [Liu Cuixia] holding the new phone in her hand, playing with it non-stop, [Zhu Ziqiang] happily left the Wenchang Palace.
1:14:37|1:14:46|Not long after walking away, [Zhu Ziqiang] hid in a corner, took out his phone from the pocket of his jacket, accurately entered a phone number, and made a call.
1:14:48|1:14:52|In the Wenchang Palace, the new phone in [Liu Cuixia]'s hand started ringing.
1:14:52|1:15:2|She answered the incoming call, pressed the connect button, and placed the phone receiver next to her ear.
1:15:7|1:15:10|Liu Cuixia's mouth corners lifted up.
1:15:26|1:15:34|Zhu Dapao stuttered as he spoke, took small steps away from the corner, while [Liu Cuixia], upon hearing this, quickly leaned against the wall behind her.
1:15:38|1:15:45|[Liu Cuixia] couldn't help but pound her chest with her hands, and later on, [Liu Cuixia] lay on the stretcher of the ambulance.
1:15:45|1:15:52|[Zhang Yu], [Zhu Ziqiang], Big Ears, and Chen Xiaobai followed by his side, sent him to the hospital.
1:16:1|1:16:14|While everyone else was away, [Zhu Meimei] rummaged through the house in an attempt to find the recipe for river crab noodles. However, despite turning everything upside down, she couldn't find the recipe.
1:16:14|1:16:21|She sat on the bed looking around, and suddenly saw her mother's will on the table. She stood up and walked towards her mother's will.
1:16:21|1:16:27|[Zhang Yu], [Zhu Ziqiang], and [Big Ears] hurriedly took [Liu Cuixia] into the emergency room.
1:16:37|1:16:42|[Liu Cuixia] got off the emergency bed and dragged [Zhu Dapao] out.
1:16:42|1:16:45|[Liu Xia], [Zhang Yu] and others gathered together in the original place.
1:16:45|1:16:49|[Zhu Ziqiang] breathed a sigh of relief.
1:16:52|1:17:0|At home, [Zhu Meimei] picked up her mother's will, and after reading it for a while, she quickly turned over the photo frame and successively opened the locks behind the frame.
1:17:2|1:17:7|After removing the back panel of the frame, a crumpled letter appeared in front of them.
1:17:7|1:17:12|[Zhu Meimei] happily opened the envelope and slowly took out the contents to examine them carefully.
1:17:12|1:17:20|In an instant, the smile on her face disappeared, replaced by an expression of incredulity.
1:17:20|1:17:26|After leaving the emergency room, [Zhu Ziqiang] silently followed behind [Liu Cuixia].
1:17:26|1:17:31|After walking for a while, Zhang Yu and Zhu Ziqiang, Big Ears couldn't help but speak.
1:18:8|1:18:11|After a few words, [Liu Cuixia] nodded silently.
1:18:11|1:18:15|Just then, [Zhu Meimei] ran over.
1:18:15|1:18:19|She glanced angrily at [Liu Cuixia].
1:19:0|1:19:2|And him, [Zhu Ziqiang].
1:19:57|1:20:1|[Zhang Yu] suddenly felt dizzy and passed out, causing everyone to rush to help support [Zhang Yu].
1:20:3|1:20:14|Everything in Qilihe remains the same, with [Zhu Ziqiang] leaning back in his office chair, a smile that couldn't be contained on his face.
1:21:29|1:21:35|Chen Xiaobai extended a finger, and [Zhu Ziqiang] stared at his finger in a daze.
1:21:35|1:21:39|[Big Ears] saw this scene and quickly walked out of the office.
1:21:39|1:21:41|[Zhang Yu] leaned back on the sofa with her eyes closed.
1:21:41|1:21:41|Zhu Ziqiang got up and walked to the other side, picking up the apple on the office desk.
1:22:2|1:22:4|[Big Ears] hurriedly walked in.
1:23:6|1:23:10|After listening to Big Ears, Zhang Yu and Zhu Ziqiang couldn't help but sigh.
1:23:11|1:23:11|At this moment, [Zhang Yu] couldn't think of a better solution.
1:25:14|1:25:21|Zhu Meimei sat on the stone steps and started to cry. Unable to control herself, she hugged [Big Ears] around the waist, and [Big Ears] happily embraced Zhu Meimei's shoulders.
1:25:53|1:26:1|A few months later, [Zhang Yu] safely gave birth to the child belonging to her and [Zhu Ziqiang], and the family of three embraced each other harmoniously.
1:26:14|1:26:24|After Chen Xiaobai finished speaking, he recalled the scene of him and Big Cannon buying the secret recipe for harmony noodles in the office.
1:26:30|1:26:34|[Big Ears] listened and then approached Pig Cannon, taking out a coin.
1:26:38|1:26:43|Then he blew on the coin and leaned close to Big Ears' ear.
