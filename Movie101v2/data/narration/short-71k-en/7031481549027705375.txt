0:2:18|0:2:24|The short-haired man standing next to Ri Tai listened, then squatted down and took out a small knife from his pocket.
0:2:27|0:2:42|Before he could cut the hemp rope on the man's body, he was splattered with blood on his face. The old man who said he would release the person fired a shot and left, urging the man with short hair to not care about the man's body and quickly skin the sheep.
0:2:44|0:2:50|But faced with the sudden turn of events, the man with short hair just squatted on the ground, staring blankly at the figure in front of him.
0:2:51|0:2:59|Today, we officially begin the film "Kekexili" that we are going to talk about.
0:3:7|0:3:24|A young man is solemnly taking notes, recording the geography and ecological environment of the Kekexili region, narrating the tragic fate of the globally rare species, Tibetan antelopes.
0:3:37|0:3:44|The protection of Tibetan antelopes is imminent.
0:3:53|0:3:59|At this moment, the man laid out the photos of the deceased from this conflict one by one on the table.
0:4:8|0:4:42|At the beginning of the film, the man who was killed was named [Qiangba]. The young man who is speaking seems to be a journalist, crossing the Gobi Desert into the county town. The muddy van stopped in front of a grand temple, and a handsome young man got out of it. After looking around, he slung his bag and headed towards the mountain. Under the gaze of the lamas at the foot of the mountain, he picked up his camera and went up the mountain.
0:4:42|0:4:46|Suddenly a group of children rushed down the hillside towards them,
0:4:54|0:4:57|Laughing and joking, [Ri Tai] asked him to take a photo for her.
0:5:0|0:5:32|The man squatted down and asked the children. Upon hearing this, the children who were originally smiling turned their heads and ran towards the mountain below in an instant. However, one of the boys turned back, pointed to the distance for the man, so he immediately stood up and looked towards the foot of the opposite mountain. The thick clouds blocked the sun firmly, and there was a gloomy atmosphere at the foot of the mountain.
0:5:32|0:5:37|He then stepped forward to the direction pointed by the boy.
0:5:37|0:6:10|At this moment, a sky burial ceremony is taking place here. Qiangba is lying face down on the ground, covered with a cloth inscribed with mantras. Besides the lamas, there are also members of the mountain patrol team around. Soon, the body attracts vultures from miles around, circling in the sky above and quickly diving down. They stand by Qiangba's head, and then the lamas tear off the cloth from Qiangba's body and spread out his limbs.
0:6:10|0:6:24|One of them finally took a machete and began to dismember his body with each stroke. The vultures, who had been standing obediently next to Ri Tai, immediately rushed forward to feast on the delicious meal.
0:6:26|0:6:35|They flapped their wings, tore, pecked, and hastily swallowed. [Ri Tai] couldn't bear to watch and had to turn his head away.
0:6:36|0:6:44|At this moment, a man in the team who is 1.7 meters tall and looks unusually silent caught his attention.
0:6:48|0:7:7|Standing behind [Ri Tai], Pingcuo pointed at Ri Tai who turned around and left, and the journalist sincerely said,
0:7:12|0:7:44|Three people stood in the small courtyard in front of the house, sizing each other up. [Ri Tai] listened to the reporter's purpose, turned his head to think for a moment, then spoke. A man with long hair responded from not far away, and then Dawa smiled as he took the backpack from the reporter and led the group towards the direction of the second floor before they disappeared from sight.
0:7:45|0:8:0|[Ri Tai] told Pingcuo, who had short curly hair behind him, that he could prepare dinner to entertain. On the other side, the people in the courtyard all stopped their movements and secretly sized up the journalist, until they went upstairs and their gaze was no longer so intense.
0:8:1|0:8:12|However, as soon as they stepped onto the platform on the second floor, the journalists were stunned to see the antelope hide on the terrace shining brightly in the sunlight.
0:8:13|0:8:18|The quantity is so large that they are even stacked together. Placed
0:8:18|0:8:53|After a while, the journalist took out some yellowed documents from his bag, which prominently displayed the young [Ri Tai]'s family information. Then he pulled out photos of the deceased from the previous conflict between the patrol team and poachers. Suddenly, the door was pushed open. He quickly closed his notebook and covered all the documents, while pouring butter tea. [Ga Yu] smiled at the journalist.
0:8:53|0:9:12|Turning around and sitting on a nearby chair, [Ga Yu] looked at the journalist with bold and kind eyes, while [Ri Tai] casually picked up the newspaper cuttings prepared by the journalist, all of which were reports about Kekexili.
0:9:12|0:9:31|After reading an article titled "From Gunfire to Peace in the 'No Man's Land'", [Leng Xue] slowly put down the newspaper, whispered a few words to the reporter, and then turned and left the room.
0:9:31|0:9:48|And as the journalist folded up the newspaper, he suddenly noticed a string of prayer beads below. As night fell, [Yangjin] brought the food to the table and then went back to the kitchen. Soon after, [Ri Tai] led the journalist in to take a look at everyone and asked a question.
0:9:50|0:10:24|As soon as the words fell, two team members immediately got up and walked towards the door. After nine people sat around the round table, [Yangjin] brought out a large pot from the kitchen and placed it steadily in the center of the table. [Ri Tai] picked up a piece of meat and handed it to the journalist, then gave him a small knife. When the journalist started cutting the meat outward, a team member couldn't help but speak up to correct him.
0:10:42|0:10:54|Liu Dong, overwhelmed by alcohol, burst into tears upon hearing the drinking. The woman immediately put her arms around his neck and drank a glass for him.
0:11:12|0:11:37|The woman even followed them outside, but [Liu Dong] left without looking back. In the middle of the night, the team woke up the journalist, armed themselves with guns, loaded supplies into the jeep, and the confused journalist could only pick up his bag and walk out of the house. When he arrived at the car, he saw the team members hugging each other, saying goodbye to their brothers, and kissing their wives.
0:11:38|0:11:55|Upon seeing the journalist about to speak, [Ri Tai] wasted no words and directly ordered him to get into the car. The family members of the other team members gathered by the car due to the sudden action, quietly praying for their safe return.
0:11:59|0:12:15|In this atmosphere, [Ri Tai] couldn't help but put his arm around [Ga Yu]'s neck, said "take care" and then opened the car door and got in. Three cars then lined up and drove away in an orderly manner under the moonlight.
0:12:15|0:12:21|Yangjin could only sob quietly as she watched her father and his group leave resolutely.
0:12:21|0:12:38|And this day happened to be November 1, 1996, a seemingly ordinary day. In the pitch-black road where you couldn't see your fingers in front of you, only the roadside was illuminated by the deliberately lit Hada, emitting a faint light.
0:12:38|0:12:44|But [Ri Tai] and his group seemed accustomed to it, just turning on the car lights and quickly driving forward.
0:12:44|0:13:4|As the day broke, three cars drove into an endless Gobi desert, with distant towering mountains. The sun rose, dispersing the mist, and the convoy stopped at a junction at the foot of the mountain, facing the scorching sun.
0:13:5|0:13:20|A truck came rushing towards them, kicking up dust in the air. The team members quickly signaled everyone to pick up their guns. [Ri Tai] explained to the reporter,
0:13:27|0:13:42|Pincuo spoke as he walked to the truck with the journalist. As soon as he finished speaking, Yixi opened the driver's door.
0:13:44|0:14:0|Without waiting for the driver to explain further, Pingcuo stepped forward, turned him around, pressed him against the car door, and searched his body up and down. Then Yixi took out a small knife he carried with him and forcefully cut a small opening in the driver's armpit of the cotton jacket.
0:14:8|0:14:22|Following [Liu Dong]'s signal, the crowded carriage of Tibetans immediately got off to be inspected. Dawa then flipped onto the car and carefully checked for any traces of Tibetan antelope wool.
0:14:36|0:14:50|Therefore, under the indication of [Ri Tai], the driver was only confiscated the Tibetan antelope wool by the patrol team and given a verbal warning. Then he could only watch as he drove the truck again, carrying a group of Tibetans away from the intersection.
0:14:51|0:15:9|The next morning, the group drove to the Nodong Spring Protection Station, where a simple tent stood at the junction of the snowy mountains and barren hills. Awang, dressed in Tibetan robes, heard a noise and quickly dropped what he was doing, opening his arms to greet the patrol team.
0:15:19|0:15:36|This is an interview from Beijing, maybe in the future everyone will become big stars. Awang led the reporter into the tent, then gestured for him to sit by the stove, and asked Pincuo to put a sack of food in the corner for the next month's living.
0:15:36|0:15:45|He, who started cutting vegetables, curiously asked [Ri Tai]: "Is there any news recently?"
0:15:54|0:16:0|[Ri Tai] bluntly stated that Qiangba had already died.
0:16:3|0:16:11|He then said a few words of caution before turning and leaving. The joy of the reunion in the tent was instantly shattered, as Awang's chopping hand...
0:16:11|0:16:18|The pace gradually slowed down, and he lowered his head, staring fixedly at the cutting board. The days must go on.
0:16:29|0:16:33|Lobsang, holding a bowl and chopsticks, was even more excited. Despite being covered in dirt, he danced happily.
0:16:41|0:16:54|Swinging their sleeves and stretching their arms, lifting their feet and landing them, seemingly powerless yet full of strength, each movement highlights the masculine and wild nature of Tibetan men.
0:17:8|0:17:14|At his suggestion, including Ri Tai, a total of 9 people from the mountain patrol team, including Ga Yu, stood in front of the simple tent and took a precious group photo.
0:17:23|0:17:28|Shouting incessantly with his mouth: Take care, we must meet again. The journalist waved his hand and turned around to ask.
0:17:42|0:17:49|Upon hearing that Awang had been stationed here alone for three years, the journalist who had already retreated into the car peeked out again.
0:17:51|0:18:9|Among the mountains, the figure of [Ma Zhanlin] is gradually being engulfed. The only companions are a tent and wisps of smoke. Besides the radio, the greatest pleasure is probably when the patrol team comes once a month to deliver food, and the brothers have a moment of singing and dancing.
0:18:12|0:18:28|In the early morning, the journalist who was sleeping in the back seat of the jeep suddenly opened his eyes, realizing that there was no one around. He quickly wrapped himself in his clothes, opened the door, and got out of the car, only to find that the other two cars were also empty.
0:18:29|0:18:35|At this moment, he glanced into the distance, where [Ri Tai] and others were gripping long spears tightly, staring ahead.
0:18:37|0:18:43|He hurried forward and, upon closer inspection, was instantly stunned by the scene in front of him.
0:18:45|0:18:53|In the desert ahead, the bones of Tibetan antelopes are neatly arranged, with the fresh blood attracting vultures from miles around.
0:18:55|0:19:0|They pecked at the carrion with their sharp beaks, and in just a few bites, a Tibetan antelope was reduced to a horrifying skeleton.
0:19:5|0:19:33|The patrol team quickly regained their composure from the scene in front of them, then headed straight towards the pile of bones. As they walked, they silently recited "403, 404, 405" in their mouths. After hearing this, the journalist walked up to [Ri Tai] and asked him. [Ri Tai] didn't respond, but instead lowered his head and cursed at the bastard who had skinned the Tibetan antelope.
0:19:36|0:19:57|Suddenly, the team members discovered two men hiding behind a small boat on the frozen Zhaonai Lake in the ice cave, firing warning shots. The two men then broke through the ice and walked towards the shore, with the tall man responding.
0:20:14|0:20:26|Ri Tai reluctantly asked the tall man for the information about the poachers, but the man refused to speak and was eventually killed.
0:20:27|0:20:43|Ri Tai took a crumpled banknote from the tall man's hand, glanced at it, and stuffed it into a cloth bag. Then he took out a seal from inside, breathed on it with his mouth, and pressed it firmly onto a small book in his hand.
0:21:28|0:21:35|With everything ready, [Liu Dong] struck a match, lit the torch, and then threw it straight into the fire pit.
0:21:36|0:21:41|The patrol team surrounded the pit, staring fixedly at the burning remains.
0:21:48|0:21:54|After a long silence, [Ri Tai] looked at the roaring fire and couldn't help but say to the reporter,
0:21:54|0:22:5|Finally, the originally piled up bones gradually charred, and the people devoutly chanted scriptures by the large pit amidst the choking smell.
0:22:5|0:22:10|The journalist stood on the side, staring fixedly at the charred remains of the Tibetan antelope.
0:22:12|0:22:20|On the fifth day, the patrol team bid farewell to the pitiful sheep and arrived at the Yak Valley, nestled in the middle of the low-lying mountains.
0:22:20|0:22:37|There is a winding path, with drought-resistant shrubs growing in this barren land. The patrol team, just like when they first set off, the three vehicles formed a line and passed through the valley, which was only about two cars wide.
0:22:39|0:22:46|Just as one of the vehicles pulled out, the leading one suddenly lost control and crashed into the raised dirt mound in the middle of the road.
0:22:48|0:23:7|The other two cars quickly stopped when they saw this, and after confirming there were no other abnormalities, [Ri Tai] was the first to open the car door and get out. The others also got out of the car one after another, and immediately arrived at the position of the first car. Upon opening the driver's door, they found the driver lying flat on the ground, face up.
0:23:10|0:23:19|[Ri Tai] bent down and quickly opened the driver's collar, revealing a gunshot wound on his left shoulder, blood continuously oozing outwards.
0:23:21|0:23:33|So he immediately tore off his clean shirt with his mouth, wrapping the wound layer by layer. [Liu Dong] and others raised their guns and took aim, staying alert on both sides of the car.
0:23:34|0:24:8|The journalist then approached the car and found a large hole on the windshield in front of the driver's seat. It turned out that the driver had been deliberately shot. At this moment, a gust of evil wind blew towards the valley, raising dust quickly obscuring everyone's vision. However, they dared not relax their vigilance. The towering mountains around them also became terrifying, as if someone would fire a cold gun at any moment. Finally, the valley returned to calmness once again.
0:24:9|0:24:15|The patrol team advanced cautiously in a single-file formation, with their hands holding guns.
0:24:15|0:24:23|[Ri Tai] tapped the ground with his heel to make sure it was solid, then he charged forward.
0:24:24|0:24:32|Other people also raised their guns one after another when they saw the situation, and soon they separated from the valley and arrived at a barren land.
0:24:36|0:24:50|At this moment, the group found an old jeep parked not far ahead. [Liu Dong] quickly went forward and squatted down to knock on the fuel tank under the car.
0:24:51|0:25:27|[Ri Tai] first opened the back door and looked inside, then turned around and opened the driver's door. Suddenly, he bent down and reached into the seat, pulling out a clump of hair. Just as they had passed by not long ago, Luosang touched the tire tracks on the ground and said, "Therefore, the mountain patrol team decided to drive and chase after them." When they saw a journalist still taking photos, [Liu Dong] quickly pulled him back into the car. Then, three cars stepped on the gas and quickly drove away from the scene.
0:25:27|0:25:37|Before leaving, they burned the car they had just used to prevent poachers from finding gasoline and coming back to hunt Tibetan antelopes by driving the car again.
0:25:37|0:26:3|On the seventh day, they arrived at the Chumar River. The patrol team on the vast Gobi Desert immediately spotted the poachers who were about to cross the river, so they quickly sounded the alarm and chased after them.
0:26:10|0:26:33|The patrol team had to open the door and get off the car, firing warning shots. The journalist quickly ran to the river, took out the camera, aimed at the poachers, and took photos. [Ri Tai] saw that the poachers showed no intention of surrendering, so he put away his rifle and quickly ordered everyone to take off their pants and wade into the water to directly capture them.
0:26:34|0:26:41|The group then waded into the waist-high river with their guns, shouting as they ran forward.
0:26:42|0:26:58|The journalist fell slightly behind because he took off his shoes and socks. It wasn't until everyone crossed a tributary that he raised his camera and jumped into the river. Soon after, the patrol team caught the poachers trying to escape.
0:26:59|0:27:7|Even if someone wanted to hide in the river halfway through, they were held down by the team members, ignoring the cold, wading and drinking water.
0:27:13|0:27:26|The patrol team then found a young man lying face down in the mud by the river, and two people dragged him by the collar to [Ri Tai].
0:27:28|0:27:39|The journalist listened and then tore open the fabric on the inside of the young man's thigh, tightly binding it with a belt.
0:27:40|0:27:48|[Ri Tai] directly declared the fate of the young people.
0:28:5|0:28:20|Upon hearing this, the poachers squatting on the side all looked towards the young man. However, the young man did not respond. Just as he finished saying "Uncle, save me," his head tilted to the side, ending his brief 20-year life.
0:28:24|0:28:31|Unable to bear it in his heart, [Ri Tai] looked at the young man who was still pleading with his eyes open, first covering his eyes with his left hand, and then reciting the six-word mantra.
0:28:33|0:28:54|After finishing speaking, Ri Tai released the young man, and then the team members lined up the captives in an orderly manner, wading through the river towards the original shore. At the same time, a team member with a gun was arranged at both the front and the back of the line to prevent anyone from escaping halfway.
0:28:55|0:29:1|The journalist stood at the front, running occasionally and turning back to capture the scene with a camera.
0:29:3|0:29:11|After filming the captives, they also made a special note of the appearance of the patrol team escorting the poachers with bare legs and guns despite the severe cold.
0:29:13|0:29:22|It is worth mentioning that [Ri Tai] also had the captives carry the young man on their shoulders. And like this,
0:29:22|0:29:30|The group waded through the bone-chilling icy water of the tributaries, finally returning to the shore.
0:29:30|0:29:36|Fortunately, the sun emerged from the clouds at this moment, its warm rays drying the soaked crowd.
0:29:36|0:29:53|Next, as they arrived at the edge of the workshop, the members of the patrol team ordered the captives to squat down on the spot, and quickly picked up the scattered pants lying on the side to put them on.
0:29:54|0:30:4|The journalist shivered as he wrung out his wet pants, quickly put them on in the light breeze, while on the other side the captives were handcuffed.
0:30:38|0:30:52|After that, the patrol team dragged a man who was almost bald away from the group of captives, and walked towards a distance. When they were far away from the crowd, Da Wa lowered his head and asked.
0:32:2|0:32:32|Under the threat of force, the driver quickly surrendered. He then led [Ri Tai], Ga Yu, [Liu Dong], and the journalist to a desolate sandy area. Before the car even came to a stop, Ga Yu pulled him out from the back seat. With his hands cuffed, he staggered towards a gasoline drum not far away. He picked up the shovel dropped by [Liu Dong], knelt in front of a small mound, and started digging with all his might.
0:32:32|0:33:14|After digging a few times, they saw a large plastic bag and pulled it out of the pit. The four of them quickly gathered around and expanded the small pit completely. Then they carried the driver and the Tibetan antelope skin back to the Chumar River. The patrol team then unpacked the plastic bags one by one, took out the Tibetan antelope skins, and neatly laid them out to dry on the sandy ground, while the captives looked on in a daze.
0:33:24|0:33:41|Upon hearing that most of the 547 pieces of parchment belonged to ewes, [Ri Tai] sighed and then walked towards the pile of parchment, followed closely by the reporter.
0:33:44|0:34:0|[Ri Tai] observed the wound on the sheepskin, then touched the traces of the gun muzzle on the sheepskin. [Ri Tai] stood up, turned around and walked towards the spread-out sheepskins, while the journalist furrowed his brow, staring at the multiple bullet holes on the sheepskin in front of him.
0:34:2|0:34:17|At night, the captives were shackled in the pickup truck they had driven themselves. The journalist, feeling irritated, lit a cigarette and had barely taken a few puffs when he heard [Ma Zhanlin] say.
0:34:26|0:34:33|[Ma Zhanlin] quickly took a puff and passed it to the young man beside him.
0:35:16|0:35:43|[Liu Dong] heard the complaints of the captives, scolded them first, then walked up to the journalist. The journalist's name turned out to be [Ga Yu], and after hearing him out, he handed over a small basin behind him. In the chaotic train carriage, only a kerosene lamp hanging from the ceiling emitted a faint light, and [Ga Yu] spoke in the dim light.
0:35:43|0:35:52|The captive, with one hand handcuffed and the other hand holding a small basin, fell into deep thought. The difficult night has passed,
0:35:52|0:36:0|[Liu Dong] walked carefully on the river surface, then used his heel to pinch the alkali soil below.
0:36:3|0:36:9|[Liu Dong] took a few more forceful steps and then gestured towards the shore.
0:36:9|0:36:37|Soon, the first jeep slowly drove from the shore onto the river, with only a driver inside. The others carefully pushed the car forward. When they were close to the opposite bank, [Liu Dong] kicked the back of the car with force. The first car safely made it onto the shore. With experience, the second and third jeeps set off at the same time and quickly crossed the river.
0:36:38|0:36:51|The last vehicle to cross the river was the pickup truck driven by the poachers. Although there was only one driver in the truck, its heavier body quickly got stuck in the alkali soil compared to the jeep.
0:36:53|0:37:11|The patrol team quickly gathered at the back of the car, using both hands and feet to push forward. The prisoners handcuffed on the shore also looked on curiously, but the car not only did not move forward, but also got its wheels stuck.
0:37:12|0:37:32|So [Liu Dong] had to take out a shovel and dig out the saline-alkali soil mixed with river water under the wheels, while on the other side, [Ri Tai] tied several bundles of hemp rope into a line, one end tied to the front hook of the pickup truck, and the other end hung on the trailer hook of the jeep on the shore.
0:37:32|0:37:40|The crowd then lined up and quickly grabbed the taut hemp rope to pull towards the shore.
0:37:42|0:38:2|At this moment, Pingcuo came to the captives, removed their handcuffs, and then drove the group to the side of the hemp rope. [Ma Zhanlin] ran to the front of the team, leading the chant first. In this way, with the efforts of everyone, the wheels stuck in the saline-alkali soil were soon pulled out.
0:38:4|0:38:23|Continuing with their momentum, they finally saw the rear wheels of the car also reach the shore. They dropped the hemp rope and raised their arms high, shouting in excitement. Although [Ga Yu] didn't shout as enthusiastically as the others, the smile on his face and the waving of his arms still showed his good mood.
0:38:25|0:38:34|The sun was setting in the west, and the patrol team members were sitting by the river, gazing at the sunset.
0:38:34|0:38:40|Losang brought a bucket of butter tea and asked. [Ri Tai] took it and drank it heartily.
0:38:40|0:38:50|He sat on the ground directly, gazing into the distance with them. After a brief rest, the team set off again in the dark.
0:38:50|0:38:59|Between the towering mountains, the jeep and pickup trucks were like four lost ants in the deep night, struggling.
0:38:59|0:39:7|Ri Tai kept moving forward with determination. It was already the ninth day since they set off.
0:39:7|0:39:27|At the foot of a mountain, the team decided to set up camp. Several people quickly shook out a tent about 5 meters wide together. After it was built, they set up a pot outside the tent, and the smell of food mixed with the steam from the pot stimulated everyone's olfactory nerves.
0:39:28|0:39:36|Yixi and [Ga Yu] bent down, took out steamed buns from the bucket in their hands, and distributed them to the prisoners, then they heard.
0:39:48|0:39:55|Ixi ignored Ma Zhanlin's complaints, picked up the empty bucket and walked outside. Ga Yu turned around and handed him a steamed bun.
0:40:0|0:40:6|After eating a hot meal, the patrol team members sat around together.
0:40:31|0:40:41|Describing my longing for my mother, Losang led the captives down from the pickup truck, accompanied by the sound of singing, and then walked towards the tents at the foot of the mountain.
0:40:41|0:40:50|[Ga Yu] stood on a high hillside, staring blankly at the backs of a group of people. He then went into the tent.
0:40:50|0:41:15|Losang first turned on the kerosene lamp hanging from the ceiling, then instructed the captives to lie on their sides with their chests against their backs. At this moment, [Ga Yu] looked up, the stars in the sky shining like gems.
0:41:19|0:41:24|After Dawar finished speaking, he stood side by side with [Ga Yu] and looked up at the sky.
0:42:15|0:42:24|In the vast wilderness of Kekexili, danger lurks everywhere. The next morning, [Ri Tai] aggressively kicked [Liu Dong] to the ground.
0:42:34|0:42:58|Bading and others quickly grabbed [Ri Tai], who turned his head and left, saying nothing. He drove away with [Ga Yu], Dawa, and [Liu Dong], facing the piercing dampness. The four of them quickly crossed the grassy foothills and ahead of them lay a mountain range completely covered in white snow.
0:42:59|0:43:43|[Ma Zhanlin] and his three sons were struggling to move forward in the snow. As soon as they got off the car, Dawa immediately fired a warning shot. Then four people chased after Ma Zhanlin and his sons. [Ri Tai] ran to Ma Zhanlin and his eldest son first, pulled out a gun, ordered them to squat down, and then kicked the eldest son down. When [Ga Yu] approached, he handed the gun directly to him and then pulled up Ma Zhanlin.
0:43:48|0:44:11|[Ri Tai] gestured for [Ma Zhanlin] to raise his hands high, then searched up and down his pockets and pants pockets, while [Liu Dong] and Dawa Dang were still catching their breath, chasing the other two younger sons. After searching for a long time without success, [Ri Tai] shifted his focus to [Ma Zhanlin]'s hat, but still found nothing.
0:44:13|0:44:37|At this moment, he lowered his head and saw the fur collar of [Ma Zhanlin]. He reached out and felt it, sure enough, he immediately took out a small knife from his pocket and cut it open on the spot. Then a shiny key appeared. [Ma Zhanlin], who had just adamantly claimed to have no key, immediately lowered his head and tried to avoid [Ri Tai]'s gaze.
0:44:39|0:44:57|Suddenly, the second son who was originally running at the front stumbled and fell into the snow. Upon seeing this, the youngest son actually stepped over him and continued to run away. [Liu Dong], who arrived late, checked the second son's breathing and then continued to chase forward.
0:44:58|0:45:12|Unexpectedly, at this moment, Dawa suddenly fell to the ground. [Ri Tai] immediately rushed over with [Ma Zhanlin] and others, then he knelt in front of Dawa and frantically pounded on his chest with his fists.
0:45:33|0:46:5|[Ga Yu] despairingly said, [Ma Zhanlin]'s eldest son suddenly spoke up. With a face full of wrinkles, [Ma Zhanlin] looked sincerely at [Ri Tai]. After some contemplation, the eldest son had his handcuffs removed by [Ri Tai]. He then took the medicine powder and quickly poured it into the syringe. Upon hearing the eldest son's instructions, [Ga Yu] immediately lifted Dawa's wrist and held it tightly. Once the eldest son found the vein, he directly pierced the needle into the back of the hand, drawing out about half a syringe of fresh blood.
0:46:5|0:46:14|He pulled it out again, mixed it with the medicine powder, and then pushed the needle back into the back of the hand with force.
0:46:14|0:46:27|On the other side, [Ma Zhanlin]'s younger son and [Liu Dong] were still chasing each other, dragging their legs as if filled with lead, struggling to move forward on the snow-covered meadow.
0:46:27|0:46:39|Finally, the youngest son couldn't hold on any longer, gasping for breath and collapsing directly to the ground, and was then successfully captured by [Liu Dong].
0:47:6|0:47:33|[Ri Tai] didn't hesitate, so Pingcuo listened and took out a crumpled 10 yuan bill and handed it to [Liu Dong]. Then Pingcuo took out two 20 yuan bills from his jacket pocket. [Liu Dong] counted them, [Ri Tai] listened and lowered his head, then gritted his teeth and said,
0:47:38|0:47:54|The two reached a consensus, [Ri Tai] walked straight towards the jeep. After [Liu Dong] safely lifted Dawa into the jeep and closed the door, he turned around to see the mountain patrol team members gathered by the car.
0:47:56|0:48:29|The leader [Ri Tai] took a step forward, directly embraced him by the neck, then pressed their foreheads together. He then lowered his voice and said, "Have a safe journey and good luck." Upon hearing this, [Liu Dong] couldn't hold back his tears, hugged [Ri Tai] tightly, and tears streamed down his dirty face. Then he turned to Yi Xi, embraced each other and said take care. After embracing the other team members one by one, [Liu Dong] came to [Ga Yu].
0:48:33|0:48:39|Unexpectedly, Ri Tai swung his arm and then was fiercely embraced with a strong grip around the shoulders.
0:48:42|0:48:58|After bidding farewell once again, [Liu Dong] resolutely turned around, opened the door of the driver's seat, and stepped on the gas pedal to drive away. The crowd watched reluctantly, but the raised dust quickly blocked their view.
0:49:23|0:49:37|After listening to the report from Losang and Bading, [Ri Tai] made a decision. At this moment, the captives jumped out of the pickup truck one by one, lined up, and orderly walked towards the nearby hillside.
0:49:38|0:49:57|Facing the armed mountain patrol, they, unarmed and handcuffed, had no choice but to comply. After walking about 50 meters, they were lined up horizontally, parallel to the edge of the slope, slowly moving backwards step by step.
0:49:57|0:50:3|If someone is not careful, the abyss behind them may be where they end up.
0:50:7|0:50:14|[Ri Tai] surveyed the faces of each prisoner, but stopped in front of [Ma Zhanlin].
0:51:8|0:51:23|Then sincerely wishing him a safe journey, [Ri Tai] looked away and shifted his gaze to the other captives. This group of people, tall or short, fat or thin, all had tears of supplication in their eyes.
0:51:26|0:51:31|Considering the current situation of supplies and food, [Ri Tai] said "live a long life" before turning and leaving the hillside.
0:51:31|0:51:37|The patrol team members guarding the prisoners also put away their guns and followed him as he left.
0:51:37|0:51:43|[Ma Zhanlin] looked at their backs, lowered his head and wiped away tears with both hands.
0:51:43|0:52:3|At this moment, [Ga Yu] couldn't help but look back. He saw the captives standing alone with their hands inserted into their sleeves, facing the wind. A hint of reluctance crossed his face, but he eventually turned his head and got into the car, heading straight towards the depths of the mountains.
0:52:3|0:52:18|The captives watched as the two cars drove away, only able to shout out their final plea for help, but their desperate cries went unanswered. Farewell to these people.
0:52:18|0:52:40|On the tenth day after departure, the mountain patrol team began to advance towards the Bugeda Peak, braving the strong ultraviolet rays, crossing over high mountain meadows. The convoy reached the hinterland of the high cold desert belt, when suddenly the rear car stopped moving forward. [Ri Tai] saw this and immediately ordered the front car to stop, then opened the door and walked towards the rear car.
0:52:55|0:53:14|Losang awkwardly shook his head while holding the cotton hat, then heard [Ri Tai] say, took off his gloves, and touched Losang's cheek. After saying to [Ga Yu], Yixi, and Bading who followed along, [Ri Tai] took the lead and walked towards the front car.
0:53:25|0:53:28|Reluctantly, [Ga Yu] followed [Ri Tai]'s footsteps.
0:53:28|0:53:42|At this moment, [Ri Tai] couldn't help but stop and look back, seeing Pingcuo casting an uneasy glance at him. He turned his head again and walked forward with difficulty.
0:53:48|0:54:7|[Ga Yu] suddenly stopped in his tracks, then turned sharply to look back at the three people in the rear car. Under the intense sunlight, the meager and rare moisture on the ground was directly baked into the air, and the figures of the three people gradually became distorted along with the gas.
0:54:7|0:54:29|As the previous car drove further into the mountains, it was completely engulfed. Two days later, [Liu Dong] finally returned to the high mountain meadow where he had caught [Ma Zhanlin] and his three sons before. The ground, recently rained on, was muddy and damp, with mud splattered all over the car body and windows.
0:54:30|0:54:55|They drove to the foot of a snow-covered mountain, where [Liu Dong] staggered out of the car, squatted down, picked up a handful of snow and rubbed it on his cheeks. Then he stuffed the remaining snow into his mouth, took a moment to clear his head, looked around at the white surroundings, and finally returned to the driver's seat to continue driving.
0:55:0|0:55:10|He, who had hardly closed his eyes, soon arrived at the grazing area, where there were also small paths naturally formed on the ground by vehicles passing by frequently.
0:55:13|0:55:32|The temple, surrounded by a large number of low-rise buildings not far away, stood out conspicuously. On the fifteenth day after setting off, [Liu Dong] finally brought [Ga Yu] back to the county town. After breaking through the fence of the health center with the front of the car, he stopped the car and immediately cut off the hair hanging on the roof with a knife.
0:55:33|0:55:55|Due to the damaged car door, he fell directly onto the gravel path in the courtyard of the health center. [Liu Dong] struggled to get up, but soon found that his legs were unable to move, so he could only prop up his upper body with his arms.
0:55:55|0:56:24|The doctor knocked on the car door with a small knife, calling out for [Ri Tai]. Soon, the doctor's shout brought help, and [Liu Dong] was placed on a bench outside the health center. The long drive had caused his face to swell, and his body was covered in dried mud marks, looking extremely disheveled. If a patient hadn't walked up to [Liu Dong] and kicked the chair hard, he probably wouldn't have woken up at all.
0:56:28|0:56:43|At this moment, upon hearing the doctor say that [Ga Yu] was fine, [Liu Dong] slowly opened his eyes. He then stood up groggily, gave the bench to the patient, and walked straight towards the health center.
0:56:45|0:56:59|Before setting off, with his neatly combed hair now tied up in a messy bun, [Liu Dong] took a few steps in place, looking at the county town facing the health center, then limped away.
0:57:0|0:57:8|The small bar in the county town was bustling at night, with music seeping through the windows into the alley.
0:57:8|0:57:20|At this moment, [Liu Dong] parked the jeep outside the bar, turned off the engine, and dragged out a young woman from the lively bar.
0:57:29|0:57:39|Refusing to be rejected by the woman, [Ri Tai] forcefully pushed her into the back seat of the car, then circled around to the front, opened the driver's door, sat down, and quickly drove away.
0:57:42|0:58:3|At this moment, on a small road in the mountains, [Liu Dong] smiled and squeezed into the back seat of the car. She was the woman who helped [Liu Dong] drink at the beginning. Seeing [Liu Dong] staring at her legs, she said,
0:58:4|0:58:44|After speaking, the woman grabbed [Liu Dong]'s messy hair, then picked up her own hair tie and wrapped it around her hand, pursed her lips, glanced at [Liu Dong] again, and asked once more. The woman pushed away [Liu Dong]'s hand, pursed her lips, and said stubbornly.
0:58:47|0:59:2|[Leng Xue] hadn't had time to complain again before being held down by [Liu Dong] at the back of her head, then fiercely bitten on the lips. The two of them, in a passionate embrace, quickly entangled with each other, and then [Liu Dong] directly pressed her down on the back seat of the car, moving up and down.
0:59:4|0:59:38|After the lovemaking, [Leng Xue] draped [Liu Dong]'s coat over him, letting him lean against her abdomen as he slept. She cried and caressed his hair, then couldn't help but touch his cheek. The open collar of [Leng Xue]'s clothes revealed her ample bosom heaving up and down with each breath. Perhaps afraid of waking [Liu Dong] with her crying, she quickly covered her mouth with her left hand.
0:59:38|0:59:48|After calming down a bit, [Leng Xue] said in a slightly mocking tone, "When you're excited, just put it down."
0:59:51|0:59:57|Seeing [Liu Dong] sleeping heavily on her lap, [Leng Xue] could no longer hold back and loudly spoke out her inner thoughts.
0:59:57|1:0:6|Then he lowered his head in this posture, looking affectionately. In the blink of an eye, it was dawn.
1:0:6|1:0:19|The yaks foraging in the mountains woke up Liu Dong, and there was no sign of Leng Xue in the car. When he got up, he found a large stack of banknotes under his headrest.
1:0:28|1:0:43|But in the mountains, apart from the yaks foraging, there was not a soul in sight. So [Liu Dong] looked down at the money in his hand, tapped his head with it, then turned around and walked towards the jeep.
1:0:45|1:0:51|On the other side, Isi drove the car with [Ri Tai] and others, continuing to accelerate forward in pursuit of the poachers.
1:0:53|1:1:1|[Ga Yu] stared straight out the window at the endless desert, and asked in a low voice,
1:1:42|1:2:11|The original desert was now being fiercely ravaged by dragon-like snowstorm. Within a radius of hundreds of miles, the only jeep was becoming its target of crazy venting. The three people in the car huddled closely together. After another gust of evil wind passed by, [Luo Sang] shuddered and woke up from his sleep, only to see a vast expanse of white. Then he opened the car door and walked out.
1:2:12|1:2:28|The wind and snow came at him with the power to pierce through his cotton clothes. Before long, [Lobsang]'s eyebrows and beard were covered with thick frost, and then he unconsciously walked forward, squinting his eyes to witness the sweeping snow.
1:2:28|1:2:48|At this moment, [Ri Tai] came to his side. [Ga Yu], who was about to burst into tears, quickly covered his mouth and nose with his hand, then lowered his head and sobbed softly.
1:2:48|1:3:3|[Pingcuo] looked at the snowstorm, gritted his teeth, then turned around and hugged [Luosang] by the neck. The two of them, in this supporting posture, struggled against the wind and snow towards the direction of the jeep.
1:3:4|1:3:16|Seeing the snowstorm getting worse, the three of them finally decided to abandon the vehicle, no longer waiting for [Liu Dong], and set off on foot with their rifles on their backs.
1:3:38|1:3:48|Facing [Ga Yu]'s question, [Ri Tai] helplessly replied,
1:4:4|1:4:16|[Ri Tai], who was originally staring motionless at the desert, suddenly turned his head to look at [Ga Yu]. Meanwhile, in the county town on the other side, [Liu Dong] had a gloomy expression as he walked down the stairs holding a large plastic bag.
1:4:18|1:4:37|Then he arrived at an abandoned wood factory. It was just getting light, and the desolate surroundings only echoed sporadic barking of dogs. A burly man with a crew cut approached [Liu Dong], handed him a thick stack of cash, and forcefully dragged away the large plastic bag.
1:4:39|1:4:52|Continuing to walk away quickly as if smoke was rising from under his feet, glancing back as he walked, afraid that [Liu Dong] might change his mind, while [Liu Dong] just tapped his head with banknotes.
1:4:54|1:5:3|The plastic bag turned out to be made of Tibetan antelope skin.
1:5:9|1:5:15|[Ri Tai] abruptly interrupted [Ga Yu]'s words and then slung the gun over his shoulder.
1:5:27|1:5:47|Looking at the dark clouds in the sky, he spoke again. Then he turned back to look at [Ga Yu] with an incredulous expression in his eyes, finally admitting,
1:5:52|1:6:8|Upon hearing this, [Ga Yu] no longer dwelled on whether [Ri Tai] knew the law and broke it, but instead turned his head and stared straight ahead at the car. At this moment, [Liu Dong] arrived at the gas station with a car full of supplies, using the money obtained from [Leng Xue] and selling Tibetan antelope skins.
1:6:10|1:6:22|After filling up the car with gas, he embraced the boss tightly with his arms through the boss's armpits, bid farewell with a smile, then turned around to the driver's seat, opened the car door, and started the vehicle.
1:6:23|1:6:31|On the other side, [Ri Tai] and the other three ran out of gas and spotted a jeep under the snow-capped mountain in the distance.
1:6:33|1:7:4|They first remained still, then [Ri Tai] took out a pistol from his pocket and handed it to [Ga Yu]. The four of them then approached the jeep with their guns, slowly. In no time, they bent down and circled around to the back of the car, only to find it empty. So [Yixi] slung the rifle on his back, then opened the hood to check the engine, while [Bading] went to the back of the car and tapped on the fuel tank.
1:7:5|1:7:21|The car not only ran out of gas, but the engine was also broken. Therefore, the two turned around and walked towards [Ri Tai]. They saw him touching the footprints on the ground, when suddenly a strong wind blew by.
1:7:28|1:7:41|The continuous mountain range in front of them pointed straight to the sky like a spear, with the peaks sometimes hidden and sometimes revealed by the clouds. After instructing to find some food, [Ri Tai] began to clean up the firearms.
1:7:45|1:8:0|[Bading] finished speaking and picked up the gun, aiming at a wild rabbit not far away. With a swift pull of the trigger, [Ga Yu] saw [Ri Tai] skillfully loading bullets and asked.
1:8:51|1:9:5|As soon as the words fell, [Ri Tai] raised a bloody rabbit leg in front of [Ga Yu]. Looking at the raw rabbit meat with fur still on it, [Ga Yu] carefully took it.
1:9:6|1:9:27|[Ri Tai] saw him frown in pain, smiled and urged him to eat quickly. So [Ga Yu] gathered courage, opened his mouth, tore off a piece of raw rabbit meat with his teeth. Watching him endure the gamey taste, his features twisted, eyes closed as he swallowed. [Ri Tai] and Liu Dong couldn't help but laugh.
1:9:27|1:9:41|Ga Yu then plucked a hair from his mouth and handed the rabbit leg to Ba Ding. On the other side, after filling up with supplies and gasoline, Liu Dong revved the engine and headed towards Huatugou.
1:9:42|1:9:55|While passing through a desolate mountain, the left front wheel of the jeep suddenly got stuck in the sandy ground in front of the mountain. The high-speed rotating tire not only failed to free the car, but instead sank even deeper.
1:9:56|1:10:4|Reluctantly, [Liu Dong] had to push open the car door and get out. He lowered his head to look at the front wheel, then turned around and walked towards the back of the car.
1:10:6|1:10:20|He loosened the hemp rope that was tightly securing the supplies and spare tires, then carefully took down the tires from the top of the carriage and leaned them against the side of the car.
1:10:21|1:10:52|He then picked up two boxes of instant noodles and a bag of blankets, turned around and walked towards the front of the car. Originally intending to reduce the weight of the car and lift the left front wheel, he suddenly felt his legs go weak, causing him to shrink by half. Upon closer inspection, he found that a large pit had unexpectedly appeared in the previously flat sand, and it tightly trapped [Liu Dong]'s lower body. Even more terrifying was that the more he struggled, the faster he sank.
1:10:53|1:11:6|In the blink of an eye, the sand had submerged him up to his chest. Despite his efforts to prop himself up with his arms in the pit, the hard sand couldn't stop him from falling further down.
1:11:6|1:11:23|At this moment, [Liu Dong]'s chest was gradually being severely compressed. With each breath he took, the capacity of his chest cavity decreased. Finally, unable to bear it any longer, he coughed, but it seemed as if there was an invisible giant hand pulling him down forcefully into the pit.
1:11:25|1:11:53|Slowly, the sand rose above [Liu Dong]'s neck, but he still refused to give up, holding tightly to the edge of the pit with his hands raised high. Unfortunately, no miracle occurred. In the end, [Liu Dong] lay face up, mouth wide open, watching himself being swallowed alive by the sand pit. What was even more astonishing was that after the undulating sand pit engulfed him, it quickly returned to its original state.
1:11:53|1:12:11|Just like the sand dunes beside it, it suddenly reminded people of the story Pingcuo had told before. This is likely the quicksand that caused the disappearance of the geologist from Beijing. In just a short minute, a vibrant life,
1:12:11|1:12:21|Silently, [Ri Tai] left. On the desolate sandy ground, two boxes of instant noodles and a bag of blankets were scattered messily by the car.
1:12:23|1:12:34|The surroundings were quiet, with only the dust kicked up by [Liu Dong]'s struggle swirling in the air, and the open jeep stood alone in front of the mountain.
1:12:35|1:12:44|If later arrivals pass through this place, they would probably only be grateful to find a car full of supplies, never imagining that beneath their feet once lay buried living people.
1:12:45|1:13:2|On the other side, the trio of Ri Tai, Ga Yu, and Liu Dong dragged their emaciated bodies, struggling to cross the snowy mountains, pass the ice pot, and traverse the desert to reach the roadside. Seeing a passing car, Ri Tai dropped his gun and raised his arms high, shouting out loud.
1:13:2|1:13:10|Unexpectedly, the other party not only did not stop, but also accelerated forward. Sunset
1:13:10|1:13:43|Still like flames burning on the vast desert, the tires rolled up endless yellow sand, instantly engulfing the three of them. On the seventeenth day of departure, [Ri Tai] and his group encountered the opposite. After a simple meal of rabbit meat at the foot of the barren mountain, the four of them set off to climb up the mountain. Unfortunately, the scorching sun suddenly turned into a snowstorm, and the unpredictable cold wind almost knocked everyone over.
1:13:44|1:14:13|Badin and Losang were eager to catch up with [Ri Tai] and Dawa ahead, but their steps became heavier and heavier. They could only hold their shoulders and move the long spears bit by bit. What's worse, in the howling wind and snow, the two of them fell down one by one, and because they could barely open their eyes, [Ri Tai] and [Ga Yu] could only rely on their feelings to move forward, so they didn't notice the situation of the two behind them at all.
1:14:13|1:14:18|The snow was falling even heavier at this moment.
1:14:18|1:14:28|The knife-like wind kept attacking the two. Fortunately, they held their breath, buried their heads, and escaped the suffocating half-way up the mountain.
1:14:29|1:14:38|After walking uphill for about half a day, the scorching sun and dryness that had previously made them feel extremely disgusted suddenly made the two of them feel very warm.
1:14:39|1:14:52|Continuing, [Ri Tai] and [Ga Yu] supported each other, climbed over a small hill, bent down with their long spears on their backs, propped up their knees and looked back along the way they came.
1:15:0|1:15:11|[Ga Yu] had just finished speaking with a pant, when [Ri Tai] saw a group of people coming down from the hill in front. As they approached closer, they realized that the newcomers were hostile.
1:15:12|1:15:19|Soon, 12 young men with long spears surrounded the two, all aiming at [Ri Tai] standing in the front.
1:15:21|1:15:55|Continuing, a person stepped forward and took off the long spear on his shoulder. Faced with the threat, [Ri Tai] did not act rashly, but looked around and then spotted a familiar face. [Ma Zhanlin] sniffed and replied, then [Ri Tai] looked at the man next to [Ma Zhanlin].
1:15:57|1:16:2|At this moment, the boss took out a cigarette from the cigarette case and handed it to [Ri Tai]. [Ri Tai] pushed his hand away.
1:16:32|1:16:42|[Ri Tai] didn't even blink, simply refused. The boss lowered his head and smiled crookedly.
1:16:49|1:17:20|Upon hearing that they were going to be mountain patrol members, everyone burst into laughter. Immediately, [Ri Tai] punched the boss to the ground. Unexpectedly, a gunshot rang out, and [Ri Tai] fell to the ground instantly. The boss then stood up and asked, a young man tremblingly replied. The boss then walked up to him, took off his gun, fiercely knocked his head, and then kicked him to the ground.
1:17:23|1:17:42|The boss then turned and walked to [Ri Tai]'s side. Seeing him still convulsing, he reached out and pulled a long gun from his subordinate's chest, loaded the bullets, aimed the muzzle at his chest and abdomen, and fired two shots in a row. The dull sound of the gun echoed through the sky.
1:17:42|1:17:49|Blood splattered, and [Ri Tai] lying on the ground ended his life just like that. Next,
1:17:49|1:17:57|The boss threw the gun to his men, led the group to turn around and leave. Not far away, [Ga Yu] was pressed down by three men and kneeling on the ground.
