0:2:12|0:2:18|With only a black cat present, just as she looked incredulous, the black cat spoke again.
0:2:19|0:2:28|[Chun Qin] was quite frightened by this strange occurrence. She quickly placed a whole plate of melons not far from the demon cat, and took the opportunity while it was stretching to make her escape.
0:2:29|0:2:35|Seeing [Chun Qin] leave, the talking demon cat did not chase after her, but remained in a lazy manner.
0:2:35|0:2:44|[Chun Qin] panicked and ran all the way to the room on the third floor. Just as she was recalling how the cat she had just encountered could speak human language, suddenly another meow broke her thoughts.
0:2:44|0:2:50|She couldn't care about her fear and hurried to the window to check. Suddenly, the voice of the demon cat came from behind again.
0:2:51|0:2:58|[Chun Qin] was startled and turned around suddenly.
0:3:13|0:3:20|The demon cat, despite limping on its left hind leg, effortlessly leaped onto the front window before leaving a parting remark.
0:3:22|0:3:32|After the demon cat finished speaking, it jumped out of the window. However, [Chun Qin] stood still in place, and suddenly her eyes flashed, as if they had turned into cat eyes.
0:3:33|0:3:43|Fortunately, [Chun Qin] soon regained consciousness. She poked her head out from behind the rockery, confirmed that the demon cat had left, and returned to the lakeside where she had been eating melons to investigate.
0:3:43|0:3:51|On the deck, there were leftover melon peels scattered around, as well as a pool of blood. Following the blood trail forward, a fish with its eyeballs eaten out was found.
0:3:51|0:3:55|Struggling desperately on the deck, blood splattered everywhere.
0:3:55|0:4:0|She arrived at the pomegranate tree and, following the words of the demon cat, indeed started digging with a hoe.
0:4:1|0:4:8|Under the tree, [Chun Qin] heard her husband returning and hurried forward to greet him. Her husband, [Chen Yunqiao], is the commander of the Jinwu Guard.
0:4:10|0:4:18|She walked arm in arm with her husband and couldn't wait to get back to the room. On the way, she recounted the encounter with the demon cat and the incident of digging for money under the tree from beginning to end.
0:4:18|0:4:24|[Chen Yunqiao] found this matter too bizarre. As soon as he entered the room, he asked [Chun Qin].
0:4:25|0:4:31|[Chun Qin] glanced back at her husband without saying a word. She slowly opened the door and then lifted the jar on the table and poured it out.
0:4:31|0:4:34|The table was covered with coins with a clatter.
0:4:34|0:4:40|[Chen Yunqiao] picked up a gold coin with surprise and looked at [Chun Qin], who was looking at him smugly.
0:4:41|0:4:50|The cawing of crows and the sound of wooden drums intermingled in the air above the Great Wall, reaching [Kong Hai]'s ears as he sat in the sedan chair, silently contemplating.
0:4:54|0:4:59|[Master Konghai] is a monk from Japan who crossed the ocean to lift a curse for the emperor.
0:4:59|0:5:8|He has a kind face, with a faint smile always hanging at the corner of his mouth. From his calm face, it's hard to guess what he is really thinking.
0:5:8|0:5:12|At this moment, he was being escorted by the royal guards to the depths of the imperial city.
0:5:12|0:5:20|The sky gradually darkened, bats continuously circling in the low air, lanterns under the eaves emitting a faint light.
0:5:29|0:5:33|The imperial attendant [Bai Letian] wrote down on paper the date and purpose of [Kong Hai]'s visit to the palace.
0:5:33|0:5:40|Following behind numerous royal guards, passing through layers of gates, [Kong Hai] arrived at the emperor's sleeping chamber.
0:5:40|0:5:48|The magnificent hall appeared even more splendid under the flickering candlelight, yet the emperor's wails continued to echo in the air, sounding particularly mournful.
0:5:48|0:6:1|The guard hurriedly brought [Kong Hai] to the Emperor's bedside. At this moment, the Emperor was lying face up, hands slightly bent in a surrendering posture, with no trace of blood on his face. His eyes were staring straight up, breathing heavily.
0:6:2|0:6:8|[Kong Hai] saw the situation and immediately asked the young minister standing beside him.
0:6:12|0:6:20|[Master Konghai] listened and vaguely sensed that something was wrong. Suddenly, a sharp meow came from above.
0:6:21|0:6:41|Once again, the demon cat appeared. [Master Konghai] vigilantly scanned the hall, about to investigate, when suddenly a scream of agony came from behind. The Emperor's face, previously lifeless, instantly flushed with blood, his eyes turned gray, then he leaped up and fell heavily back onto the bed. At that moment, [Master Konghai] was certain that the Emperor's illness was caused by the demon cat.
0:6:41|0:6:45|Suddenly, the sound of bells rang out, and the courtiers all knelt down.
0:6:50|0:6:57|[Bai Letian] hesitated and didn't start writing. Just as the imperial physician urged him to write, [Kong Hai] noticed the footprints on the ground.
0:7:0|0:7:6|A young official instructed at the door.
0:7:11|0:7:19|Kong Hai made a soft exclamation. Looking down at his feet, Kong Hai realized that they were covered with many shiny things.
0:7:25|0:7:33|Just as [Kong Hai] was puzzled and lost in thought looking into the distance, he suddenly heard someone calling him from behind.
0:7:34|0:7:41|[Master Konghai] turned around and unexpectedly saw [Bai Letian] walking towards him.
0:8:14|0:8:20|[Bai Letian] took the hair from [Kong Hai] and examined it carefully before saying.
0:8:20|0:8:26|Suddenly, [Kong Hai] seemed to have discovered something and walked quickly forward. Following the direction pointed by [Kong Hai],
0:8:28|0:8:34|Under the moonlight, [Bai Letian] discovered fluorescent cat footprints on the ground of the imperial city.
0:8:50|0:8:57|Between the two of them talking, a wooden sign suddenly appeared on the ground. [Kong Hai] bent down to pick it up, but the wooden sign moved on its own, startling [Bai Letian]. [Kong Hai] picked up the wooden sign, and there was writing on it.
0:9:8|0:9:13|As soon as the imperial palace courtyard was mentioned, thunder roared, as if something bad was about to happen.
0:9:13|0:9:28|That night in the mansion of [Chen Yunqiao], he was enjoying a romantic moment with [Chun Qin]. The two were in bed together when they heard the sound of broken tiles outside. Sensing it was the work of a demon cat, [Chun Qin] whispered to [Chen Yunqiao]'s ear.
0:9:40|0:9:47|But at this moment, [Chen Yunqiao] only had thoughts of the gentle town, he pounced on [Chun Qin], with no room in his mind for anything else.
0:9:48|0:9:57|Little did he know that, through the moonlight, the shadow of a cat was being cast on the wall inside their house, watching their every move.
0:9:57|0:10:9|In the middle of the night, [Bai Letian] sneaked into the Imperial Library in the Imperial Hall. The hall was filled with boxes of all sizes. He stepped on a wooden box and reached out to grab a small box on top labeled "Phoenix Perch Tower".
0:10:9|0:10:15|After obtaining it, he first looked around cautiously to make sure no one had noticed before carefully opening the box.
0:10:15|0:10:19|Inside the box is a key carved with a phoenix and the words "Death upon intrusion".
0:10:20|0:10:24|Suddenly there was a sound of the door opening, and he quickly blew out the candle and sneaked out.
0:10:24|0:10:30|Taking advantage of the night, he hid in the artificial mountain in the palace, and when no one followed, he headed towards the Phoenix Perch Tower.
0:10:30|0:10:37|He agilely passed through the hidden secret passage in the artificial mountain. Judging by his familiar and confident demeanor, it was clear that he had been here before.
0:10:37|0:10:47|Before long, he arrived at the Phoenix Perch Pavilion. He pushed open the heavy door and found it empty inside.
0:10:47|0:10:53|Ascending the towering cloud ladder, they finally arrived at the inner hall. Looking up, various constellation patterns were embedded on the dome.
0:10:54|0:11:5|In the middle of the hall was a round cloisonné box three people high. Unfortunately, he didn't have time to admire the scenery in the hall carefully. He took three steps and stepped onto the steps in front of the cloisonné box, taking out the key he had stolen from the Imperial Hall.
0:11:5|0:11:14|He carefully opened the box with a portrait of the empress. To his surprise, inside was another box with a dragon head painted on it, and upon opening that, there was yet another box with a sea pattern.
0:11:14|0:11:25|Upon opening the patterned box, Bai Letian finally saw what was inside the cabinet. Just as he was about to reach for it, a pipa suddenly appeared behind him and started playing on its own.
0:11:26|0:11:36|To avoid alerting the patrolling soldiers outside, he quickly went to grab the pipa. After some maneuvering, he finally managed to grab hold of the pipa, but still made some noise in the process.
0:11:41|0:11:53|Just as the soldiers outside were puzzled, the mechanism inside the house was triggered again. At the critical moment, [Bai Letian] rushed to the cabinet, took out the sachet inside, and iron arrows poured down from the roof, deeply piercing into the ground.
0:11:53|0:11:59|Fortunately, he reacted quickly and managed to escape. Just as he rushed down the ladder, he suddenly heard the voices of the soldiers.
0:11:59|0:12:3|Luckily, he hid behind the door, and suddenly a cat's meow was heard.
0:12:5|0:12:12|Outside the house, the guards saw a cat appearing on the railing of a gap, thinking that the noise just now was made by the cat, so they didn't investigate further.
0:12:13|0:12:17|Bai Letian, who was hiding behind the door, thus escaped unscathed.
0:12:18|0:12:24|The next morning, [Bai Letian] went to visit [Master Konghai], only to find Master Konghai packing his bags at home. Bai Letian bowed to Master Konghai.
0:12:37|0:12:48|He sat down on the couch while speaking, and added.
0:14:54|0:14:58|[Bai Letian] said triumphantly, then turned around and walked away. [Kong Hai] smiled and followed after.
0:14:58|0:15:6|The two of them walked and chatted on the bustling streets of Chang'an.
0:15:31|0:15:38|The distant sound of the bell from the Great Blue Dragon Temple could be heard as they were talking. Accompanied by the melodious bell sound, the two walked through the bustling acrobatic performance.
0:15:38|0:15:46|Finally, he was attracted by the shout of a melon farmer.
0:15:54|0:16:6|The two walked through the crowd to the melon farmer. He first showed the watermelon seeds to everyone, then bent down to plant the seeds in the ground, and covered them with soil using his feet. He then took out a water bottle to show to everyone, and proceeded to water the newly planted watermelon.
0:16:6|0:16:14|In front of everyone's eyes, something magical happened - the watermelon seeds sprouted.
0:16:14|0:16:21|It not only sprouted, but also grew taller and taller. Soon the watermelon vines extended and began to entwine around the trellis.
0:16:22|0:16:36|Some were puzzled, some were surprised, with various expressions. Following the instructions of the farmer, the watermelon instantly climbed up the entire trellis, then bloomed, and finally bore a large watermelon.
0:16:36|0:16:45|Just as [Bai Letian] and the others were cheering and applauding, [Kong Hai] remained indifferent.
0:16:56|0:17:5|Just as [Bai Letian] felt that [Kong Hai] was unreasonable, a melon farmer picked a watermelon, cut it with a knife, revealing the flesh inside, and the crowd applauded again. Reluctantly, [Bai Letian] followed [Kong Hai] as they left, when suddenly the melon farmer rushed up to them.
0:17:44|0:17:50|After finishing his words, the melon farmer stuffed the watermelon into [Kong Hai]'s arms, laughed heartily, and turned away. [Kong Hai] walked through the market holding the melon, when suddenly [Bai Letian] noticed something was wrong.
0:17:59|0:18:3|After Bai Letian finished speaking, he snatched the fish head from Kong Hai's hand and ran off. Kong Hai stared at the fish blood on his hand.
0:18:23|0:18:31|The two arrived outside the imperial city to find [Chen Yunqiao], and happened to see him finishing his duty, chatting with his men about having fun tonight.
0:18:32|0:18:38|A group of people set off on horseback, whistling as they go, with [Bai Letian] pointing at the receding figures and saying to [Kong Hai].
0:18:39|0:18:48|Chen Yunqiao sat on the horse with a hunched back and squinted eyes, looking rather unhappy. Bai Letian and Kong Hai, without horses, had to take shortcuts to chase after them as best as they could.
0:18:48|0:18:52|After a chase, [Chen Yunqiao] and others dismounted at the ferry crossing, preparing to change boats.
0:19:19|0:19:28|Upon hearing that [Kong Hai] was going to the brothel, [Bai Letian] burst into laughter. The Hu Yulou was built by the water, accompanied by the sound of the river waves, and the sky gradually darkened.
0:19:28|0:19:32|The twinkling lights quickly connected into a whole, and beautiful singing voices came from the building.
0:19:42|0:19:48|At this moment, [Chen Yunqiao] stood unmoved at the bow of the boat, despite the soft calls of the girls.
0:19:48|0:19:57|It turns out that he had a lover named [Bai Ling] at the Huyu Tower. Just as [Bai Ling] was twisting her slender waist to go find her lover [Chen Yunqiao], she suddenly bumped into [Chen Yunqiao] who was scrutinizing [Yu Lian] up and down.
0:20:0|0:20:6|Chen Yunqiao was immediately attracted to the beauty of Yu Lian.
0:20:17|0:20:26|After saying that, [Yu Lian] was taken away, completely forgetting about her lover [Bai Ling]. Enraged with jealousy, [Bai Ling] forcefully stabbed her jade hairpin into the nearby armrest. She stormed back to her room.
0:20:26|0:20:32|Surprisingly, the jade hairpin that was just stuck in the armrest appeared intact on the table.
0:20:35|0:20:41|She picked up the jade hairpin and examined it carefully, confirming it was hers. Just as she was puzzled, she suddenly heard a strange voice.
0:20:42|0:20:49|A strange thing happened again, the wine pot on the table poured wine into the cup next to it on its own, [Bai Ling] was frightened and kept backing away.
0:20:49|0:20:54|Just as the wine in the cup was being poured, [Bai Ling]'s expression also changed.
0:20:55|0:21:6|She was surrounded by a demonic aura, casually tossing aside her jade hairpin. Her eyes stared straight ahead, with dark circles around them and a glowing gaze, as if possessed by a demon.
0:21:6|0:21:12|The scene shifts to outside the house, with a bright moon reflected on the lake, as [Bai Letian] and [Master Konghai] row their boat towards it.
0:21:20|0:21:27|After the two of them finished speaking and burst into laughter, [Chen Yunqiao] was focused on watching [Yu Lian] dance, thoroughly enjoying himself.
0:21:27|0:21:36|Dressed in a flowing robe with waist-length hair, swaying gracefully to the lingering sound of the pipa, [Yu Lian] captivated the audience with her enchanting dance from that moment on.
0:21:36|0:21:48|With the rhythm of the music, she gracefully raises her wrist and lowers her brows, lightly moving her hands like drifting clouds, captivating the hearts of all the audience present. Suddenly, a charming and enchanting woman with seductive eyes and a captivating smile also joins in.
0:21:48|0:22:0|Enter. Suddenly, his eyes furrowed, as if filled with endless sorrow. Then, a radiant smile appeared on his face, as if filled with boundless joy. Truly embodying the saying, "Such a scene is only found in heaven, rarely seen in the human world."
0:22:1|0:22:8|On the other side, [Bai Letian] and [Master Konghai] also arrived. Just as the two of them were going upstairs, a constable stopped [Bai Letian].
0:22:21|0:22:30|[Bai Letian] and [Master Konghai] arrived at the hall with ease, just in time to see [Yu Lian] gracefully spinning in the center of the hall with her veil, indicating that this exquisite and unparalleled dance performance was coming to an end.
0:22:30|0:22:39|But Master Konghai suddenly became interested and quietly walked behind Yu Lian. Yu Lian pretended to fall, and Master Konghai supported her with his long sleeves, and the two of them jumped up again.
0:22:40|0:22:50|I didn't expect the Japanese monk to dance, his hand movements like a butterfly fluttering around [Yu Lian]. The two interacted frequently, and with his accompaniment, [Yu Lian]'s dance gained a different kind of charm.
0:22:50|0:22:59|[Chen Yunqiao] and the others were watching with great interest. After another dance, [Bai Letian] pulled [Master Konghai] to a corridor and started mocking him.
0:23:6|0:23:12|[Kong Hai] laughed heartily. During the conversation, Lixiang walked over with a wine glass. [Kong Hai] noticed something unusual about Lixiang's hairpin and took a closer look.
0:23:12|0:23:20|Li Xiang noticed and gave a cold snort at [Kong Hai], then she swayed her waist and walked straight towards [Chen Yunqiao], respectfully handing him the wine.
0:23:21|0:23:33|[Chen Yunqiao] didn't even glance at Lixiang, just coldly took the wine glass, then leered at the dancing [Yu Lian]. After the song ended, he stood up unsteadily and casually said to everyone.
0:23:47|0:23:52|[Yu Lian] looked at Lixiang, knowing that Lixiang was angry with her for stealing her lover, and for a moment didn't know how to respond.
0:23:52|0:24:5|At this moment, [Chen Yunqiao] handed a glass of wine to himself, and [Yu Lian] happened to finish it in one gulp. Just as everyone was enjoying themselves, suddenly [Kong Hai] felt like there was something upstairs, and the laughter around him seemed to become sharp and eerie.
0:24:5|0:24:10|The painted sea on the screen turned into a real sea with towering waves in an instant.
0:24:10|0:24:15|Suddenly, the shadow of a cat appeared on the screen.
0:24:16|0:24:23|It turns out to be that talking cat demon again. At this moment, [Chen Yunqiao] hears someone calling his name and looks around drunkenly.
0:24:44|0:24:50|Chen Yunqiao felt uncomfortable hearing this and immediately stood up to address everyone.
0:25:5|0:25:22|As soon as the demon cat finished speaking, the dagger of [Chen Yunqiao] stabbed into the screen, and the shadow of the demon cat disappeared instantly, with a sudden burst of firelight from the candles on the wall. The dancers were so scared that they dared not move.
0:25:22|0:25:43|The Jinwu Guards drew their swords in defense, but at this moment, Li Xiang quietly stood up from behind [Chen Yunqiao]. Suddenly, a shadow passed through the neck of [Chen Yunqiao]. He touched his neck and found blood on his hand, with three deep scratch marks appearing on his face. He quickly drew his sword, and a fierce battle was about to begin. The girls from the Huyu Tower had never seen such a scene before and all fled in all directions.
0:25:46|0:25:50|At this moment, a black shadow swept across the top of them, one step, two steps, and wherever it went, the candlelight extinguished instantly.
0:25:50|0:25:56|A sharp-eyed Bai Letian discovered the location of the demon cat.
0:25:57|0:26:4|As soon as the words fell, the sword was thrust towards the demon cat. The demon cat leaped down, passed by the feet of the Jinwu Guards, and everyone fell to the ground.
0:26:4|0:26:10|Fortunately, [Bai Letian] acted quickly to close the door, avoiding detection by the demon cat and escaping unharmed. However, those inside were not so lucky.
0:26:10|0:26:20|Some were scratched and fell to the ground by the cat demon, some were knocked and fell downstairs, while others were thrown high in the air by the cat demon and then fell heavily. However, the cat demon did not harm the helpless girls.
0:26:20|0:26:31|It jumped onto the table and then shouted at [Chen Yunqiao].
0:26:32|0:26:40|After the demon cat finished speaking, it jumped off the table and swaggered past the Jinwu guards.
0:26:40|0:26:45|None of them dared to make a move now, all watching as the demon cat leaped onto the fence outside the door.
0:26:45|0:26:51|The demon cat looked back at the collapsed Jinwu guards on the ground and left in a victorious manner.
0:26:51|0:27:0|The demon cat fled in a panic as soon as it left [Chen Yunqiao], while Lixiang seemed to be acting guilty, lowering her head and preparing to leave sneakily. At this moment, she suddenly encountered a Jinwuwei whose eyes had been gouged out by the demon cat.
0:27:4|0:27:10|Seeing Jin Wuwei's eye sockets bloody and terrifying, causing Lixiang to scream in horror. At the same time, [Chun Qin] also fainted on the ground.
0:27:10|0:27:17|Chen Yunqiao ran back home with sweat all over his head, pushed open the courtyard door, found nothing unusual, finally breathed a sigh of relief, and was about to run into the house.
0:27:17|0:27:25|Suddenly he saw [Chun Qin] sitting by the lake with her back to him. When [Chun Qin] didn't respond, he felt a bit worried and ran through the long corridor to where she was.
0:27:25|0:27:32|When he arrived, [Chun Qin] had disappeared without a trace. Just as he was puzzled, he suddenly noticed that the lake surface seemed different from usual.
0:27:32|0:27:41|He walked to the lakeside to investigate and found that the dead fish floating all over the lake had their eyeballs gouged out, which scared him so much that his legs went weak, almost falling into the water.
0:27:42|0:27:49|The next morning, [Master Konghai] and others arrived at the crime scene of Hu Yulou with the soldiers.
0:28:28|0:28:33|Minister Li realized that he had wrongly accused Bai Letian before, so he walked up to him to apologize for what happened before.
0:28:48|0:28:53|[Master Konghai] was moved by [Bai Letian]'s unyielding attitude and grabbed him, bowing to him.
0:29:0|0:29:8|Li Shaojian stood by the lake and talked to the two people.
0:29:19|0:29:26|Bidding farewell, [Li Shaojian] and the two walked back on the road.
0:30:14|0:30:19|Master Konghai's myriad thoughts could not find an answer.
0:30:19|0:30:27|[Bai Letian] took him to a city tower.
0:30:30|0:30:39|Master Konghai turned around and gazed at the distant imperial city after hearing that.
0:30:39|0:30:50|Suddenly, the weather changed dramatically, and [Master Konghai] snorted coldly.
0:30:52|0:31:1|As the sky darkened, finally arriving at the second night as agreed with the demon cat, [Chen Yunqiao] and [Chun Qin] lay on the bed with anxious hearts.
0:31:8|0:31:17|As soon as the two finished speaking, a black shadow swiftly leaped over the courtyard wall.
0:31:24|0:31:39|As the two were busy shifting blame onto each other, a cat's shadow unexpectedly appeared on the lantern of the Chen family's night patrol servant. The Taoist priest in the courtyard, holding peach wood and reciting sutras with his mouth, was completely unaware. And so, the demon cat easily made its way into the inner courtyard hidden in the servant's lantern.
0:31:39|0:31:47|At the entrance of the inner courtyard, another Taoist priest is performing a ritual with peach wood. The shadow of the demon cat is directly printed on the wall behind the Taoist this time, but unfortunately, he still hasn't noticed.
0:31:47|0:31:52|The demon cat then entered the room, walked up the stairs, and passed through the door crack to the second floor.
0:31:52|0:31:57|The corridor was empty, and the demon cat swaggered through it.
0:31:57|0:32:3|Arriving at the staircase, with only the last flight of stairs left, the demon cat would soon meet the couple [Chen Yunqiao].
0:32:3|0:32:7|It quietly climbed the last step and encountered another Taoist.
0:32:7|0:32:16|The Taoist sat with his eyes closed, chanting incantations silently at the table. The demon cat leaped lightly onto the table.
0:32:16|0:32:25|The Taoist slowly opened his eyes upon hearing movement, only to find the demon cat staring at him. The demon cat extended its sharp claws, ready to take the Taoist's life in an instant.
0:32:25|0:32:43|In the room, [Chen Yunqiao] was awakened and hastily picked up his sword. Without bothering to put on his clothes, he opened the door to look around. Large patches of blood on the ground caught his eye, and he knew it was the work of the demon cat. With his clothes disheveled, he tightly gripped the sword and carefully followed the bloodstains downstairs to investigate.
0:32:43|0:33:5|As he pushed open the door, he suddenly found the bodies of two Taoist priests lying at his feet. He was so scared that he scrambled upstairs to find [Chun Qin]. Suddenly he heard [Chun Qin]'s miserable cry and rushed into the room. As soon as he entered, he was stunned. It turned out that the demon cat was lying on [Chun Qin]'s legs at this time, and [Chun Qin] seemed to have changed into a different person, actually playing with the cat.
0:33:5|0:33:10|The demon cat spoke to [Chen Yunqiao].
0:33:13|0:33:17|He extended his claws and left a scratch on the snow-white neck of [Chun Qin].
0:33:17|0:33:25|[Chen Yunqiao] fled in panic, no longer caring about saving [Chun Qin]. In an instant, he ran to the gate and shouted at the guards on duty.
0:33:36|0:33:45|[Chun Qin] stood by the bed calling for help to her husband, but suddenly she was dragged into the room by the demon cat. Seeing this, [Chen Yunqiao] hurried towards [Chun Qin], but suddenly he closed the door and locked it from the outside.
0:33:45|0:33:52|At this moment, a strange laughter was heard, and looking towards it, it turned out to be [Chun Qin]. Strange, wasn't she just upstairs a moment ago?
0:33:52|0:34:0|How did you end up here at this moment? [Chen Yunqiao] staggered to [Chun Qin]'s side and whispered tentatively.
0:34:4|0:34:14|The woman with the appearance of [Chun Qin] suddenly took out a fish and ate the fish's eyeball in front of [Chen Yunqiao].
0:34:14|0:34:18|Chen Yunqiao was so scared that he fled in a panic.
0:34:33|0:34:37|Peony followed Master Konghai's orders to fetch fresh meat with blood on it, while Bai Letian couldn't help but step forward to check on Yu Lian's injuries.
0:34:37|0:34:44|Seeing the festering wound on [Yu Lian]'s leg, [Bai Letian] was shocked.
0:34:47|0:34:53|At this moment, [Chen Yunqiao] also arrived at the Hu Yulou. He knocked hard on the door of his old friend Lixiang, hoping to hide here for a while.
0:34:56|0:35:7|In Lijiang, the cold-hearted [Chen Yunqiao] was seen, he snorted and closed the door. Suddenly, he saw Peony carrying raw meat and followed her all the way. [Kong Hai] was writing densely packed words on [Yu Lian]'s calf.
0:35:10|0:35:17|[Master Konghai] spoke as he lifted the skirt covering [Yu Lian]'s knees.
0:35:31|0:35:38|Following Master Konghai's orders, Mudan held Yu Lian, Bai Letian carried raw meat, and he pierced Yu Lian's toes with a needle, causing blood to flow instantly.
0:35:39|0:35:49|[Bai Letian] quickly caught the blood flowing from [Yu Lian]'s toes with raw meat, and the meat in the bowl turned into millions of worms wriggling in an instant. At this moment, [Chen Yunqiao] hiding behind the door saw [Kong Hai] detoxifying with raw meat.
0:36:18|0:36:25|Chen Yunqiao, hiding behind the door, saw Kong Hai's superb magic skills, so he pushed the door open and knelt directly on the ground, begging Kong Hai for help.
0:36:27|0:36:38|Upon hearing about the strange occurrences at the Chen residence from [Chen Yunqiao], [Kong Hai] and [Bai Letian] hurried there under the moonlight. The Chen residence was shrouded in a sinister atmosphere under the moonlight.
0:36:38|0:36:46|Suddenly, the two of them discovered that [Chun Qin] had appeared on the roof, reciting poetry with her mouth.
0:36:51|0:37:1|Suddenly, Chun Qin slipped and almost fell, Kong Hai immediately walked forward. Bai Letian, who realized what happened, hurried to catch up. The two finally found Chun Qin's bedroom, only to see Chun Qin lying on the bed.
0:37:32|0:37:39|After that, [Bai Letian] left the Chen's residence with [Kong Hai], and at this moment, the shadow of the demon cat reappeared.
0:37:40|0:37:44|As the sky gradually lightened, [Bai Letian] quietly sneaked into the imperial city with [Kong Hai].
0:37:44|0:37:50|Fortunately, it was the changing of the guards at that time. Seizing the opportunity, the two of them ran into a palace.
0:37:50|0:37:57|The books in the hall cover the entire wall, with bookshelves neatly arranged in the middle. Asked [Master Konghai].
0:38:7|0:38:17|While climbing up the ladder to search for books, [Kong Hai] pushed from below and [Bai Letian] searched above. Finally, the two stopped in front of the history section bookshelf. Just as [Bai Letian] was searching around,
0:38:17|0:38:26|[Kong Hai] suddenly noticed a firefly flying below, and it landed right on the record of the daily life of Emperor [Tang Xuanzong] during the Kaiyuan era that [Bai Letian] was looking for.
0:38:28|0:38:34|On the first page of the book, it is written.
0:40:16|0:40:24|[Bai Letian] excitedly describes to [Kong Hai] the love of [Li Longji] for [Yang Yuhuan].
0:40:38|0:40:45|Although [Bai Letian] spoke passionately, [Kong Hai] remained unmoved.
0:41:2|0:41:10|Bai Letian seemed to have traveled back to the time of Tang Xuanzong as he spoke.
0:41:10|0:41:21|The gate of the Huaye Xianghui Tower opened to him, and the stunningly beautiful [Yang Yuhuan] slowly walked towards him. With a slight smile towards [Bai Letian], [Bai Letian] completely fell for her. On the side, [Kong Hai] knew that [Bai Letian] had completely succumbed.
0:41:21|0:41:26|Bai Letian was immersed in his own fantasy as he spoke, but he was interrupted before long.
0:42:10|0:42:18|The melon farmer turned around and saw [Kong Hai].
0:43:12|0:43:17|In the distance, the bell of the Qingyun Temple rang again. [Kong Hai] bid farewell to Guaweng, and then went to find [Bai Letian] to go to the Chen Mansion again.
0:43:17|0:43:26|Bai Letian was not happy this time, muttering all the way, worried that he would also have his eyeballs eaten by the demon cat.
0:43:39|0:43:48|As soon as [Kong Hai] finished speaking, the sky suddenly changed, and a blooming cherry blossom tree appeared outside the door of [Chen Yunqiao]'s house, with a woman standing under the tree.
0:44:2|0:44:8|Just as they finished speaking, a mist rose behind them. When they turned around, they found nothing unusual. [Bai Letian] approached the woman under the tree.
0:44:8|0:44:14|Recognizing her as Yang Yuhuan from 30 years ago, he wanted to get closer to Yang Yuhuan. Master Konghai behind him reminded him.
0:44:16|0:44:21|[Master Konghai] had just finished speaking when the noble consort disappeared along with the tree in front of [Bai Letian], and the sky cleared up again.
0:44:21|0:44:32|The previous events turned out to be an illusion. Just one night passed since the two pushed open the door of Chen Yunqiao's house, but it seemed like many years had gone by. The courtyard was overgrown with weeds, resembling an abandoned dilapidated house.
0:44:33|0:44:43|Just as they were talking, suddenly the voice of [Chun Qin] was heard, and she was seen sitting by the window shouting at the two.
0:44:43|0:44:52|[Bai Letian] and [Kong Hai] came upstairs, while [Chun Qin] in a long dress appeared even more beautiful.
0:44:56|0:45:0|Bai Letian looked uneasily at the tea on the table covered with silk nets, and glanced at Kong Hai.
0:45:0|0:45:5|At this moment, [Kong Hai] sat down calmly, although he was full of doubts in his heart, he had no choice but to follow suit.
0:45:5|0:45:12|Who knew that as soon as [Kong Hai] sat down, he picked up the teacup covered in silk net and took a sip, and no one could stop him.
0:45:29|0:45:38|After [Kong Hai] and [Chun Qin] finished speaking, they burst into laughter. [Bai Letian] awkwardly chuckled along with them.
0:45:38|0:45:45|During the conversation, he picked up a teacup, and suddenly a large spider crawled out from inside. Fortunately, [Master Konghai] acted quickly and tapped him twice, making the spider disappear.
0:48:39|0:48:48|[Chun Qin] did not answer, turned her back to the two of them, a tear slid from the corner of her eye.
0:48:56|0:49:9|[Bai Letian] wanted to ask further, but at this moment [Chun Qin] had already fainted and couldn't wake up. Suddenly, a demonic wind blew through the room, sweeping away all the dried leaves inside. In an instant, [Chen Yunqiao] returned to his original form, and the two realized that it was another illusion created by the demon cat.
0:49:9|0:49:16|Although it was an illusion, what it said was true. The two of them did find a dried cat skin under the bed.
0:49:19|0:49:26|[Bai Letian] picked up its body and discussed with [Master Konghai] to set a fire in the courtyard to burn it, which could be considered as a comfort to its soul.
0:49:26|0:49:36|The case of the demon cat is finally resolved. [Chen Yunqiao] survived the crisis and hosted a banquet for many guests, with [Chun Qin] performing a dance for the guests.
0:49:36|0:49:41|[Chen Yunqiao] raised his glass to thank [Kong Hai] and [Bai Letian].
0:49:46|0:49:53|Three people were drinking heartily below the stage, with [Chun Qin] tied to copper bells on her feet, draped in thin gauze, dancing gracefully on the drum. The guests couldn't help but applaud and cheer.
0:49:54|0:50:5|During the banquet, [Chun Qin] tossed the thin veil on her shoulders in front of [Chen Yunqiao], who grabbed it and pulled her towards him with a bit of force. The two then started dancing, escalating the atmosphere of the banquet to a climax.
0:50:5|0:50:13|The accompaniment became more and more intense, and as the two performed more brilliantly, the intrigued [Bai Letian] began to introduce the origin of this dance music to [Kong Hai].
0:50:19|0:50:29|Dancing [Chun Qin] and [Chen Yunqiao] are just like the imperial concubine and [Tang Xuanzong] back in the day.
0:50:29|0:50:48|At this moment, [Chun Qin] led [Chen Yunqiao] behind the screen with a thin veil. However, when the two emerged, the veil was unexpectedly wrapped around [Chun Qin]'s neck by [Chen Yunqiao]. [Kong Hai] and [Bai Letian] hurried to intervene, but [Chen Yunqiao], as if possessed by a supernatural force, leaped and pulled [Chun Qin] with the veil onto the guests' table, shattering the dishes and utensils.
0:50:48|0:50:55|Suddenly the curtains rolled up, the doors and windows closed, red smoke rose, and the guests were scared and fled in all directions, leaving only the musicians playing more and more intensely.
0:50:56|0:51:2|[Chen Yunqiao] dragged [Chun Qin] onto the drum, which seemed to have a magical power, and it sucked the table over and arranged it neatly.
0:51:2|0:51:11|He knocked [Chun Qin] down, his body pressing tightly against [Chun Qin], and said in his mouth.
0:51:21|0:51:28|[Kong Hai] stood quietly on the side, observing everything with a cold gaze. The more frenzied the musicians played, the more [Chen Yunqiao] went crazy and strangled [Chun Qin].
0:51:28|0:51:37|[Kong Hai] arrived at the musician and gently touched the musician who was holding the pipa. The musician immediately turned around, the strange light in his eyes disappeared instantly, obviously they were both under the illusion of the demon cat.
0:51:37|0:51:45|The musician fainted, the music stopped, and [Chen Yunqiao] finally regained his senses. He suddenly realized that he was strangling [Chun Qin].
0:51:45|0:51:57|Seeing [Chun Qin] lying on the drum, struggling for breath, he panicked and quickly let go. Unfortunately, it was already too late.
0:51:57|0:52:4|[Chun Qin] said in a weak voice at last.
0:52:8|0:52:15|She stared with her eyes wide open as she was strangled to death by her own husband. [Chen Yunqiao] wiped away her tears with the hem of her clothes, as if speaking to herself and to others at the same time.
0:52:17|0:52:23|After saying goodbye to [Chen Yunqiao], he turned and left as if nothing had happened. Suddenly, another cat's meow was heard.
0:52:28|0:52:38|Outside the house, Bai Letian saw Chen Yunqiao sitting on a tree, throwing money down. Witnessing the tragic end of the Chen family, Bai Letian said indignantly.
0:52:48|0:52:57|But [Kong Hai] was inspired by this and pressed [Bai Letian] for more information.
0:53:18|0:53:24|Upon hearing Master Konghai's judgment, Bai Letian's face turned extremely ugly.
0:53:27|0:53:51|He angrily interrogated [Kong Hai], who remained silent. [Bai Letian] turned and left. [Kong Hai] looked at [Bai Letian]'s almost frantic accusations with pity in his eyes. Suddenly, [Bai Letian] turned back and continued speaking. [Bai Letian] slammed the door and left [Kong Hai] alone.
0:53:52|0:53:58|The sky above Chang'an City is still shrouded in dark clouds. To uncover the truth, [Kong Hai] once again visits the home of [Bai Letian].
0:53:58|0:54:4|Upon entering, he saw the unwashed dishes of [Bai Letian] on the stove, with spoiled leftovers attracting flies buzzing around.
0:54:4|0:54:13|[Bai Letian] is sitting at his desk, lost in thought. His room is filled with books, and even the walls are covered with paintings.
0:54:20|0:54:36|[Kong Hai] saw a painting on the ground and picked it up. Looking around, he realized that it was a portrait of the woman on the entire wall, she was [Yang Yuhuan]. [Bai Letian] hurriedly got up, wanting to tear down the painting on the wall.
0:55:27|0:55:37|After [Kong Hai] took the painting of [Yang Yuhuan] from [Bai Letian] and left the room, hoping to give [Bai Letian] some time alone, but [Bai Letian] was not grateful.
0:55:37|0:55:43|[Kong Hai] had just walked out of the room when he closed the door behind him. The more he thought about it, the angrier he got, and finally couldn't help but say to [Kong Hai] through the wall,
0:57:18|0:57:24|The love story of "Changhen Ge" told by [Kong Hai] is fake, completely shattering the last defense line in [Bai Letian]'s heart.
0:57:24|0:57:36|He stood in front of the door, and it took a long time before he turned around to face [Master Konghai], tears in his eyes as he spoke.
0:58:44|0:58:52|The master looked at [Kong Hai] with a reassuring gaze.
0:59:16|0:59:22|[Kong Hai] bid farewell to his deceased master, shouldered his luggage, leaned on his cane, and wore wooden clogs.
0:59:22|0:59:26|Trudging through the snowy white, thus began the journey to the Tang Dynasty.
0:59:26|0:59:34|Throughout the journey, he had to climb over steep mountain peaks and sail across vast oceans in a small boat. Unfortunately, he encountered a fierce storm at sea, with waves as high as 10 meters.
0:59:43|0:59:44|A moment of wailing filled the air.
0:59:44|0:59:53|Facing the threat of death, [Kong Hai] showed signs of panic, but a woman beside him remained calm, soothing the child in her arms with a peaceful expression.
0:59:53|0:59:55|[Master Konghai] couldn't help but ask.
1:0:4|1:0:12|As [Kong Hai] looked at the woman in confusion, suddenly the sea water rushed into the boat. Eventually, the small boat couldn't withstand the sea storm and sank to the bottom of the sea, dragging everyone into the water.
1:0:12|1:0:19|Fortunately, [Master Konghai] had learned to swim. He struggled to swim out of the boat, but the wind and waves did not stop, instead becoming more violent.
1:0:19|1:0:27|The waves crashed heavily layer by layer on the sea, and due to exhaustion, he was still swept into the sea.
1:0:36|1:0:43|Just as [Kong Hai] was about to be drowned, a sudden thought crossed his mind.
1:0:56|1:1:4|[Bai Letian] was moved by [Master Konghai], and the two set out on a journey to find the truth once again.
1:2:43|1:2:48|After the two bid farewell, Mama came to the loom as usual and wove white silk.
1:2:48|1:2:54|She was weaving when suddenly a cat jumped onto the loom. The maid was startled at first, then stopped her work.
1:2:54|1:3:0|Then strangely, a cat suddenly appeared. The cat turned its head and stared at her intently.
1:3:0|1:3:11|After a while, a fierce voice came out of its mouth. The demon cat then cut the white thread on the loom with its sharp claws, and all the threads wrapped around the nanny's neck. And that's how it happened.
1:3:11|1:3:14|The nanny was strangled to death by the white silk she had woven.
1:3:14|1:3:19|At the same time, [Bai Letian] and [Master Konghai] were discussing the suspicious points of the death of the imperial concubine on the road.
1:3:43|1:3:49|In the midst of their conversation, the two suddenly realized that Nanny might be in danger and hurried back.
1:3:50|1:3:57|At this moment, the nanny had indeed fallen in front of the loom, her neck wrapped in white thread. Seeing the tragic death of the nanny, [Bai Letian] couldn't help but blame [Kong Hai].
1:4:0|1:4:7|Another life was taken by the demon cat, Bai Letian angrily pounded his hand against the wall.
1:4:10|1:4:18|To uncover the truth, [Bai Letian] brought [Kong Hai] back to the Imperial Library. [Bai Letian] handed the documents to [Kong Hai], but he accidentally dropped them.
1:4:19|1:4:26|With a loud crash, the documents scattered all over the floor, catching the attention of [Master Konghai] with a list of missing names waiting to be filled in.
1:4:59|1:5:5|[Bai Letian] blurted out, [Kong Hai] quickly stopped him to prevent the demon cat from hearing. In order to arrive at [Bai Ling]'s house before the demon cat could strike, the two hurried through the rain.
1:5:6|1:5:15|[Bai Ling], a Japanese woman, stood in front of the house with a friendly expression to greet them.
1:5:17|1:5:24|Master Konghai walked into the room, bowed to Bai Ling, and started conversing with her in Japanese.
1:5:57|1:6:5|[Bai Ling] lowered her head and hesitated for a long time before finally speaking.
1:6:51|1:7:0|[Bai Ling] finished speaking and then smiled bitterly. [Master Konghai] saw the helplessness and sadness in [Bai Ling]'s eyes and said.
1:7:0|1:7:8|She didn't answer, silently turned around and led the two into the courtyard. The rain outside had stopped at some point.
1:7:8|1:7:15|[Bai Ling] walked to the grave of her husband, Mr. [Abe Nakamaro], with [Master Konghai] behind her, bowing deeply towards [Nakamaro]'s tomb.
1:7:32|1:7:38|Perhaps it was Bai Ling who was moved by Master Konghai's words. She returned to her room and took out her husband's diary to give to Master Konghai, telling him about the contents of the diary.
1:8:4|1:8:11|[Master Konghai] and [Bai Letian] sat on the city tower and began to read, following the diary as if they had traveled back to the Xuanzong era 30 years ago.
1:8:11|1:8:19|That day, the crowd in Chang'an City was bustling and lively. [Abe Nakamaro] rode a spirited horse through it, looking particularly dazzling.
1:8:55|1:9:3|At this moment, [Yang Yuhuan] was draped in a light gauze, wearing a splendid peony on her head, swaying on a high swing in the lingering sunset.
1:9:3|1:9:17|She not only received the admiration of the people in Chang'an City, but also stirred the heart of [Abe Nakamaro], all because of a glance at [Yang Yuhuan], planting a seed of love in his heart. [Abe Nakamaro] decided to confess his love to [Yang Yuhuan].
1:9:26|1:9:32|Following Abe Nakamaro's diary, Bai Letian and Kong Hai discovered that 30 years ago, in order to celebrate Yang Yuhuan's birthday,
1:9:32|1:9:39|The extravagant Paradise Feast hosted by [Tang Xuanzong]. At that time, the city of Chang'an was brightly lit.
1:9:39|1:9:41|Fireworks in the sky bloomed freely,
1:9:41|1:9:48|The tinkling laughter echoed in the ears. A dreamlike phoenix carriage slowly moved along Chang'an Street in the city.
1:9:48|1:9:53|This is just the prelude to the feast of paradise, and we can already see [Abe Nakamaro] enraptured.
1:9:53|1:10:0|He followed Feng Luan through the crowded people, and soon arrived at the location of the banquet, the Huaxi Hall.
1:10:0|1:10:5|[Abe Nakamaro] is about to meet [Yang Yuhuan] here, and he can hardly contain his excitement.
1:10:5|1:10:16|Suddenly, two mischievous little girls appeared in front of the building. They had drawn mustaches on their mouths, pretending to be men, and peeked out from the doorway with a smile, watching the continuous stream of visitors outside.
1:10:16|1:10:28|[Abe Nakamaro] was amused by these two little girls, so he followed them through the crowd and finally arrived at the banquet hall. Above the hall, there were dancers with various expressions, like a painting unfolding before everyone's eyes.
1:10:29|1:10:38|Just as everyone marveled at how the dancer was flying in the sky and staying still, suddenly the wine pot hanging in the air poured out wine on its own, which then flowed into the dancer's mouth.
1:10:38|1:10:43|The dancer hadn't even had a chance to taste it properly when the wine jug brushed against something and fell to the ground, shattering into pieces.
1:10:43|1:10:48|The strange thing is that the fragments slowly grew into flowers. Then even more miraculous things happened.
1:10:48|1:11:3|The sea of flowers on the ground unexpectedly turned into a canvas, which was lifted by someone, and red wine slowly overflowed from underneath. In no time, a wine pool appeared. Above the wine pool, a flute suddenly appeared, lightly tapping it twice. A [White-robed Maiden] leaped out of the wine pool.
1:11:3|1:11:10|[The White Girl] reached out to grab the flute, but the mischievous flute flew higher and higher. Unwilling to give up, [The White Girl] stepped on the auspicious clouds and followed it up.
1:11:10|1:11:16|They flew higher and higher, until they reached the sky. Finally, she grabbed the flute in the clouds.
1:11:16|1:11:24|The flute had no choice but to obey, and soon the sound of the flute came from the sky. However, along with the melodious flute sound, raindrops began to fall slowly.
1:11:25|1:11:31|Some people were suddenly startled by the rain, some clapped and cheered, while others danced in the rain.
1:11:31|1:11:35|Abe Nakamaro was once again amazed by the fantastic performance in front of him.
1:11:35|1:11:45|It's strange, the [girl in white] playing the flute is clearly in the clouds, how come there's a shadow reflecting on the water surface, and the shadow is even separating from the [girl in white], suddenly turning into a water droplet falling rapidly downwards.
1:11:45|1:11:48|Just before landing, he transformed back into a man.
1:11:48|1:11:56|The crowd was startled, thinking the man had accidentally fallen from above. Suddenly, the man somersaulted and landed steadily on a red line.
1:11:56|1:12:13|Using the bouncing power of the rope, the man soared into the sky again and pulled the girl playing the flute down. The two of them suddenly plunged into the wine pool, and the dancers beside the wine pool waved their sleeves together. The two of them transformed into two golden carps and rushed out. They intertwined in the air and gradually turned into two graceful young men.
1:12:13|1:12:23|Even more peculiarly, the young man's clothes changed from the red Ni Chang to a white feather robe, and their wonderful performance pushed the atmosphere to a climax, everyone couldn't help but applaud.
1:12:23|1:12:32|Abe Nakamaro was completely captivated by this spectacular fantasy performance. Just as he reached out to touch the dancer, she suddenly turned into a wisp of green smoke and disappeared.
1:12:32|1:12:41|The performance came to an end, but the most exciting moment began as [Yang Yuhuan] appeared.
1:13:8|1:13:11|[Yang Yuhuan] did not answer, but instead asked [Gao Lishi].
1:13:11|1:13:18|As she walked forward, suddenly her skirt was stepped on by someone. When she turned around, she found that person was the Emperor.
1:13:18|1:13:26|The Emperor covered half of his face with the hem of his robe, making everyone laugh heartily. The Empress was also amused by the Emperor, and the two of them walked to the center of the hall together.
1:13:29|1:13:40|A Taoist priest stood in front of the emperor and the empress, tossing a piece of origami into the air. The origami instantly transformed into a fierce tiger, causing the guests to flee in all directions.
1:13:42|1:13:56|As the tiger leaped into the crowd, it suddenly transformed into pink petals floating in the air, shocking everyone once again with the scene before their eyes. The Taoist performer concluded the act and explained to the Emperor and the Empress.
1:14:20|1:14:24|They would snatch the grapes that were almost in someone's mouth when no one was paying attention, and then take away the fine wine from a rich man's hand.
1:14:26|1:14:32|After finishing the wine, he casually threw the wine cup into the Taiye Pool, unexpectedly the cup turned into a magpie and flew away.
1:14:32|1:14:40|The two ran past [Abe Nakamaro] and even threw him a bunch of grapes.
1:14:47|1:14:55|The two young men transformed into white cranes as they soared above the Huaye Xianghui Tower, undoubtedly adding a vivid touch to the feast of paradise.
1:14:56|1:15:10|Watching the white crane youth flying in the air, everyone was surprised, even the noble concubine. Reading this, [Bai Letian] was surprised to find that the demon cat had also appeared at the banquet.
1:15:22|1:15:28|Li Bai got drunk and was forcibly carried by Gao Lishi to the side of the Taiye Pool.
1:16:40|1:16:54|[Gao Lishi] didn't want to be framed by [Li Bai], so he grabbed [Li Bai]'s boots and pulled them off. Seeing his plan succeed, [Li Bai] happily crawled to the nearby wine pool, stuck his head in, and started drinking.
1:17:3|1:17:14|The two were discussing the Empress's emerald hairpin when, upon turning around, they found the Empress standing behind them. In order to prove his identity and to show off, [Dan Long] intentionally transformed into a white crane in front of the Empress.
1:17:24|1:17:33|The noble concubine greatly admired the handsome young man in front of her. [Dan Long] could only reluctantly offer his hands.
1:18:55|1:19:8|He recited while writing, slowly leaning back as if his thoughts flew to the sky nine thousand miles high. With tears in his eyes, he continued to recite.
1:19:18|1:19:24|After reciting these two lines of poetry, a tear suddenly fell from the corner of his eye. He lifted his brush and continued writing behind [Gao Lishi].
1:19:24|1:19:33|Li Bai's crazy and frenzied state attracted many guests to watch. Finally, he made a bold stroke and said to Gao Lishi.
1:19:37|1:19:43|Li Bai threw his brush into the wine pool.
1:19:50|1:19:54|After leaving [Gao Lishi] aside, he leaned against a rock and fell asleep, soon snoring loudly.
1:19:55|1:19:59|On this side, [Bai Letian] and [Master Konghai] also found the Huaye Xianghui Building 30 years later.
1:19:59|1:20:8|Time flies, years have passed, the once magnificent palace has now turned into a deserted place overgrown with weeds.
1:20:8|1:20:17|The two pushed open the long-sealed door, searching around the hall. Finally, [Kong Hai] found something in the dried-up Taiye Pool and quickly called [Bai Letian] over.
1:20:19|1:20:26|It's a broken pen. [Bai Letian] carefully picked it up and showed it to [Kong Hai] with excitement, tears welling up in his eyes.
1:20:34|1:20:40|In his dream, [Li Bai] was awakened by [Gao Lishi]. In a daze, he suddenly realized that Yang Yuhuan was approaching him, which startled him.
1:20:40|1:20:46|Fortunately, the noble concubine did not mind [Li Bai]'s awkward entrance, but instead gently spoke to him.
1:21:25|1:21:32|The empress did not get angry, but instead walked over to him to remind him. It was when Li Bai was putting on his shoes.
1:21:43|1:21:48|Li Bai was stunned by the Empress's praise, watching her departing figure, Li Bai suddenly recited the poem he had just written.
1:22:36|1:22:41|The bright moon was already hanging high in the sky at some point, and in the blink of an eye, the feast in paradise was coming to an end.
1:22:42|1:22:50|At this moment, the Empress is accompanying the Emperor in the waterside pavilion by the lake, practicing calligraphy, away from the bustling banquet, enjoying the wonderful time together.
1:22:51|1:22:59|The moment was interrupted by the sudden visit of [Abe Nakamaro], causing the Emperor to stop his pen and look at [Abe Nakamaro] in surprise, creating a tense atmosphere.
1:23:41|1:23:58|The Emperor put down his pen, walked up to [Yang Yuhuan], grabbed her shoulder, and looked at her face. [Abe Nakamaro] watched the Emperor gaze at [Yang Yuhuan] with such affection, feeling a myriad of emotions but not knowing where to begin.
1:25:1|1:25:9|The emperor beat the drum and fought with An Lushan, who wielded a curved knife. Everyone was worried that he would be injured by An Lushan, but he was completely unconcerned.
1:25:18|1:25:26|Indeed, An Lushan did not harm the emperor at all, but engaged in a passionate martial arts battle with His Majesty. The feast of extreme joy came to an end in such revelry.
1:25:29|1:25:37|The scene shifts to 30 years later, where [Bai Letian] and [Kong Hai] continue to explore the truth of the past following the diary of [Abe Nakamaro].
1:25:37|1:25:45|They rowed the boat to Yanqiu Gate. Before the boat even stopped, [Bai Letian] excitedly ran ashore and stood in front of Yanqiu Gate, pointing ahead to [Kong Hai].
1:25:59|1:26:15|Following the direction pointed by [Bai Letian], the time has once again returned to 30 years ago. In the distant sky, billowing smoke filled the air, soldiers with long spears in hand were fleeing with their families from all directions, among them was Emperor Li Longji.
1:26:15|1:26:22|Who would have thought that the proud emperor at the feast of paradise would only last for ten days and then flee from the imperial palace in such a sorry state.
1:26:22|1:26:40|Walking forward with the support of the guards, he suddenly stopped for no apparent reason, remained silent for a while, then slapped the hat off the guard next to him. The guard quickly bowed in a gesture of apology, but he knew in his heart that the emperor was venting his anger on him.
1:26:41|1:26:50|This sentence is both addressed to the 100,000 soldiers and to oneself. Finally, they arrived at Ma Wei Inn overnight.
1:27:5|1:27:24|At this moment, the Emperor is standing on the dilapidated city wall, looking at the soldiers in the distance. Upon hearing the report from [Huang He], he slowly turns around, his gaze sharp, and as soon as he enters the room, he gives orders to the guards. With one command from the Emperor, the guards open all the doors.
1:27:24|1:27:31|General Gao Lishi quickly walked towards the emperor with a plate in his hands, and soon presented it in front of the emperor.
1:27:31|1:27:38|The Emperor lifted a red silk cloth, revealing the blackened head of [Yang Yuhuan].
1:27:38|1:27:42|[Gao Lishi] pretended to remain calm and continued to pass on the message.
1:27:59|1:28:3|Abe Nakamaro behind him hurried forward when he heard the conversation between the two.
1:28:7|1:28:18|Abe Nakamaro approached the Emperor and whispered something. The Emperor looked towards the direction of the Empress upstairs, his eyes filled with sadness but a hint of a smile on his lips.
1:28:21|1:28:26|The emperor turned around and asked [Huang He] to leave the hall. Abe, unwilling to give up, decided to try his luck and headed towards the direction of the second floor where the concubines were.
1:28:27|1:28:32|She was sitting on a broken chair at the moment, quietly listening to [Bai Long] playing music.
1:28:32|1:28:39|She heard footsteps and suddenly turned around to see Abe Nakamaro.
1:28:42|1:28:48|She agreed to Abe's request, and the two of them moved to the side.
1:28:56|1:29:3|She remained silent for a moment before turning around and saying.
1:29:13|1:29:21|Instead of meeting Abe's gaze, [Ma Dongmei] slowly walked past him.
1:29:23|1:29:32|As the Emperor said, he lost.
1:29:32|1:29:40|[Yang Yuhuan] refused his request. Abe didn't say anything more, he bowed and turned to leave. Suddenly, [Yang Yuhuan] called out to him, tears welling up in her eyes.
1:31:50|1:31:55|Just when everyone was at a loss, [Huang He] presented a plan to the emperor.
1:31:55|1:32:1|He ordered [Dan Long] to lie on the stone slab in front of everyone, then took out a silver needle and inserted it into [Dan Long]'s neck.
1:32:1|1:32:11|Before long, [Dan Long] fell into a deep sleep, as if he had died. [Huang He] explained to everyone.
1:33:10|1:33:16|While the Emperor was talking to [Yang Yuhuan], [Huang He] pulled out the silver needle from the neck of [Dan Long], and Dan Long's eyelids immediately twitched.
1:33:19|1:33:23|[Huang He] finished speaking, and [Dan Long] did indeed manage to get up, but he hadn't taken two steps before falling to the ground.
1:33:23|1:33:31|Bai Long quickly helped up Dan Long. Huang He explained to everyone.
1:33:35|1:33:41|Although Huang He said there was no major problem, Bai Long had some doubts in his heart. At this moment, Gao Lishi hurriedly offered his advice.
1:33:58|1:34:5|In the distance, a long sobbing sound could be heard, and [Yang Yuhuan] looked at the emperor expressionlessly.
1:34:5|1:34:9|The emperor dared not look at her, he lowered his head and asked [Huang He] softly.
1:34:13|1:34:20|Huang He's response was like a reassuring needle, the Emperor walked up to Yang Yuhuan.
1:34:36|1:34:52|[Bai Long] heard their discussion and immediately stepped forward to stop everyone. However, [Huang He] unexpectedly struck his left leg heavily with a stick. He leaned against a stone slab, hoping [Yang Yuhuan] would resist her fate, but she seemed to be a bystander, calmly watching everything.
1:34:59|1:35:7|[Kong Hai] was convinced that they were going to bury the noble consort alive, which [Bai Letian] couldn't accept. And 30 years ago, [Yang Yuhuan]
1:35:7|1:35:13|Watching her beloved man in front of her just lightly nodded, even trying to squeeze out a smile.
1:35:13|1:35:22|After obtaining her consent, the Emperor immediately poured her a glass of wine. Without any hesitation, she picked up the glass and drank it all in one gulp before turning and heading upstairs.
1:35:23|1:35:36|Just as she took a few steps, she suddenly stopped, as if remembering something. She took out a sachet embroidered with the words "Jade Slave" from her sleeve and handed it to the Emperor. Her gaze followed the sachet to the Emperor, then to the crowd, filled with love and reluctance.
1:35:36|1:35:49|She immediately withdrew her gaze, afraid that if she looked for too long, she would no longer be willing to accept her fate.
1:35:59|1:36:18|As if dead, Yang Yuhuan lay on the cold stone slab, just as the old nanny said, she looked like she was asleep, even more beautiful than when she was awake. Looking at her body, Huang He asked Gao Lishi.
1:36:32|1:36:36|Huang He finished speaking and Gao Lishi pointed at him anxiously.
1:36:43|1:36:55|[Gao Lishi] turned around, intending to plead with the Emperor for justice. But when he saw the Emperor's expression, he realized that it was actually the Emperor's intention. He could only bow his head and remain silent.
1:36:55|1:37:2|The next morning, Commander of the Imperial Guards [Chen Xuanli], who is the father of [Chen Yunqiao], was summoned to examine the body of [Yang Yuhuan].
1:37:2|1:37:7|He walked into the dilapidated palace where the emperor was currently residing, holding a sword, under the gaze of thousands of generals.
1:37:7|1:37:12|The roof leaks, the walls offer no protection from the wind, and the floor creaks underfoot, with the possibility of collapse at any moment.
1:37:13|1:37:21|He arrived on the second floor under the gaze of [Bai Long] and [Dan Long]. There, [Yang Yuhuan], dressed in a long skirt, lay quietly on the stone slab, as if she had not yet woken up.
1:37:21|1:37:30|He couldn't help but admire her beauty and at the same time expressed doubt about her death. He looked at [Dan Long] and [Bai Long] who were accompanying the noble consort.
1:37:30|1:37:37|Just then, the wailing of [Gao Lishi] came from downstairs.
1:37:39|1:37:50|He looked in the direction of the sound and saw that the Emperor was beating [Gao Lishi] with a stick. Each strike made [Gao Lishi] roll on the ground. Amidst [Gao Lishi]'s cries,
1:37:59|1:38:4|Finally, after repeated strikes, Gao Lishi fell unconscious, leaving Tang Xuanzong stunned by the scene before him.
1:38:11|1:38:28|[Tang Xuanzong] was in a panic when he saw this scene. He rushed downstairs, threw away his sword, and knelt in front of the emperor, hugging his legs, begging for forgiveness.
1:38:37|1:38:44|He hysterically roared at [Master Konghai].
1:39:9|1:39:17|The rebellion ended with the death of [Yang Yuhuan].
1:39:56|1:40:4|Accompanied by the mournful meowing, the door of the ancient tomb was shut heavily, and [Bai Letian] stared blankly, asking with sadness in his voice, "Why is it raining so heavily?"
1:41:0|1:41:8|[Master Konghai] wanted to find the tomb of [Yang Yuhuan], so the two followed the clues left in [Abe Nakamaro]'s diary, crossed a forest in the water, and indeed found an ancient tomb.
1:41:8|1:41:16|[Bai Letian] just arrived at the door and was met by a large group of flies pouring out. Behind him, [Master Konghai] decisively spoke up.
1:41:28|1:41:40|Just as the two were puzzled about why the stone door was opened, the eyes of the stone statue on the wall suddenly moved slightly. [Bai Letian] sensed something was wrong, so he quickly ran to the statue to check, but found nothing unusual. He was scared and hurried to call [Master Konghai].
1:42:6|1:42:14|The coffin was empty, and [Bai Letian] excitedly said to [Kong Hai].
1:42:18|1:42:23|Just as [Bai Letian] was getting excited, [Kong Hai] suddenly lay down in the coffin, leaving [Bai Letian] puzzled as he asked him.
1:42:33|1:42:43|Watching the determined look in [Kong Hai]'s eyes, [Bai Letian] had no choice but to follow suit. He struggled to close the coffin, leaving [Kong Hai] alone inside. Holding up a candle, [Kong Hai] carefully examined as if he had discovered something, suddenly a sound came from inside the coffin.
1:42:43|1:42:52|The sound of heavy blows. This frightened Bai Letian outside the coffin, and he exerted all his strength to finally push open the coffin lid.
1:42:52|1:42:55|[Master Konghai] rushed out from inside and quickly hid behind the stone coffin.
1:42:56|1:43:13|He, holding a lantern, came to [Kong Hai] and suddenly found that [Kong Hai] was crying. [Kong Hai] immediately avoided his gaze, turned his back, and pushed the coffin lid. Without asking too much, [Bai Letian] had to help him push it together. The coffin lid was overturned by the two of them, revealing streaks of blood inside.
1:43:24|1:43:32|Both [Bai Letian] and [Kong Hai] cried as they looked at the bloodstains on the stone coffin lid.
1:43:33|1:43:49|The two looked in the direction of the sound, only to find that the demon cat had also appeared in the ancient tomb at some point. The demon cat spoke as it jumped onto a coffin. Without answering Kong Hai's question, Bai Letian asked at this moment.
1:44:5|1:44:12|Listening to the tale of the demon cat, [Bai Letian] and [Kong Hai] were already in tears.
1:44:12|1:44:21|At this moment, the demon cat turned its head, and the two saw at the cave entrance the scene of [Bai Long] limping with a torch being held by [Dan Long] as they entered the ancient tomb 30 years ago.
1:44:21|1:44:32|They hurried forward, and after Bai Letian, Kong Hai, Bai Long, and Dan Long exchanged glances across time and space, Bai Letian finally realized that this was just another illusion created by the demon cat.
1:44:41|1:44:51|Just as [Bai Long] and [Dan Long] approached [Bai Letian] and [Kong Hai], the illusion of the young [Huang He] suddenly disappeared, and a hint of sadness appeared on the face of the demon cat at this moment.
1:44:52|1:44:58|[Bai Letian] and [Kong Hai] are searching everywhere for the missing [Bai He] youth. At this moment, the demon cat behind them speaks again.
1:45:15|1:45:21|The demon cat once again uses illusion, and the scene returns to 30 years ago. Inside the ancient tomb, [Yang Yuhuan] lies covered in blood.
1:45:22|1:45:39|Bai Long and Dan Long looked at each other in shock. Without much time to think, Bai Long pulled Yang Yuhuan out of the tomb and the illusion disappeared. The demon cat jumped in front of the two, Bai Letian asked excitedly. The demon cat did not answer.
1:45:41|1:45:49|At this moment, the scene shifts to a waterfall hanging on the edge of a cliff, with a cave on the side of the cliff, which is where [Bai Long] hides [Yang Yuhuan].
1:45:49|1:45:56|[Bai Long] carefully fed water to [Yang Yuhuan] with leaves, and [Dan Long] behind him couldn't bear it and stepped forward to speak.
1:47:39|1:47:47|After Bai Long dragged his left foot, he turned and walked into the cave. Dan Long called out to him from behind.
1:48:0|1:48:7|[Bai Long] looked at [Yang Yuhuan] lying on the stone bed and answered confidently. When [Kong Hai] inquired about [Dan Long],
1:48:7|1:48:12|The demon cat showed a look of loss, and the scene returned to 30 years ago.
1:48:28|1:48:37|After [Dan Long] bid farewell to [Bai Long] in the sunset, the white crane youth was never seen in this world again.
1:48:38|1:48:42|[Bai Long] returned to the cave disappointedly, staring blankly at the body of [Yang Yuhuan] for a long time.
1:48:43|1:48:48|He knew that in this world, besides the corpse of [Yang Yuhuan], there was also the imperial cat that could accompany him.
1:48:49|1:48:58|Seeing this, [Kong Hai] couldn't help but want to comfort the cat demon in front of him with his hand, but the demon cat was not grateful and turned away after leaving claw marks on [Kong Hai]'s hand.
1:49:0|1:49:5|[Kong Hai] did not blame the demon cat, because he knew it carried too much bitterness in its heart.
1:49:5|1:49:16|[Master Konghai] further approached to ask him about what happened next. Later, [Yang Yuhuan]'s body began to decay.
1:49:16|1:49:19|Just like what [Yu Lian] had on at that time.
1:49:19|1:49:26|This really scared Bai Long. He nervously checked Yang Yuhuan's body, saw her festering wound, and couldn't help but touch it.
1:49:26|1:49:34|He was bitten by the venomous insects inside by accident.
1:49:35|1:49:44|[Bai Long] needed a piece of raw meat, so he looked at the imperial cat next to him and pulled out a dagger. The imperial cat seemed to sense its fate and closed its eyes.
1:49:44|1:49:50|Bai Long's knife approached Yumao bit by bit, but at the last moment, Bai Long softened his heart and put away the dagger.
1:49:51|1:50:0|Suddenly he felt like there were worms squirming in his hand. Oh no, he realized he had just touched the body of [Yang Yuhuan], and he was also poisoned.
1:50:0|1:50:8|He stood up in a panic, his survival instinct telling him to leave quickly to find fresh meat, maybe he could still survive. But if he left, what about [Yang Yuhuan]?
1:50:8|1:50:17|Finally, he made a bold decision, taking out a dagger to cut open [Yang Yuhuan]'s skin, and then using his mouth to suck out the worms on her body.
1:50:18|1:50:40|It turns out that [Bai Long] was using his own body as live bait to draw out the worms in [Yang Yuhuan]'s body. After a heart-wrenching scream from [Bai Long], the poison in [Yang Yuhuan]'s body finally disappeared. He excitedly reached out to touch [Yang Yuhuan]'s face, only to find that his hand had already decayed.
1:50:40|1:50:50|He quickly tore open his shirt in fear, his body already gnawed by the insects to a bloody mess. Looking at his decaying body, he was extremely frightened.
1:50:50|1:50:55|But he only had one thought in his mind.
1:50:59|1:51:3|A strong wind suddenly rose, leaving [Bai Long] in excruciating pain from the insect bites.
1:51:3|1:51:9|Looking at the imperial cat, he understood that in order to survive and continue to accompany [Yang Yuhuan], he couldn't keep his own body.
1:51:9|1:51:15|So he wanted to discard his youthful body and transfer his soul into the body of Master Konghai.
1:51:18|1:51:23|It seems that Yumaomiao sensed that behind his crazy behavior, there was a deep love for [Yang Yuhuan].
1:51:23|1:51:32|Yumo happily came to his side, and together they completed this soul's journey. [Bai Long] succeeded,
1:51:32|1:51:42|He infused his soul into the body of the Imperial Cat, and from then on, the graceful and handsome youth [Bai Long] no longer existed in this world, nor did the Imperial Cat. They merged into one and became the current Monster Cat.
1:51:42|1:52:2|The demon cat approached [Bai Long], touched him with its claws, still holding hope that [Bai Long] would wake up, but there was no response. He turned into a lifeless body lying quietly on the ground. The demon cat stared at [Bai Long] for a long time, tears filling its eyes. Upon hearing his narration, [Master Konghai] said sorrowfully.
1:52:18|1:52:27|With a rush of water, Bai Long's body was carried downstream and plunged into the water. He stood at the edge of the cliff, looking on, bidding farewell to his physical form.
1:52:27|1:52:34|He turned around and returned to the cave, continuing to accompany Yang Yuhuan day and night.
1:52:34|1:52:41|He wished so much that the woman in front of him could wake up and ask again.
1:52:41|1:52:51|Unfortunately, he never heard it again.
1:53:13|1:53:18|He longed to help [Yang Yuhuan] open the heavy coffin lid on the stone tomb, but he couldn't do it, he couldn't.
1:53:18|1:53:24|He could only hear the desperate screams of [Yang Yuhuan] over and over again. He was furious, he roared,
1:53:24|1:53:28|The final decision was to seek revenge on Emperor Tang Xuanzong.
1:53:28|1:53:40|The demon cat arrived at the Seven Star Pavilion. At this moment, the Emperor was looking at the final token left to him by [Yang Yuhuan], the sachet containing her hair. His reverie was interrupted by a cat's cry.
1:53:40|1:53:52|He has aged, his back is no longer as straight as before, and his hair has turned white. He finally recognized that this was his imperial cat, hurried forward, and ended up slipping on the stairs by accident.
1:53:54|1:54:0|The emperor awkwardly lay on the stairs and asked the imperial cat. The imperial cat immediately jumped in front of the emperor, who then touched the cat's head and asked again.
1:54:14|1:54:22|He was extremely scared, quickly got up, and stared at the demon cat, which also stared back at him.
1:54:22|1:54:30|He was so scared that he tried to escape by rolling and crawling, but how could an old man escape from a demon cat? With a light leap, the demon cat pounced and knocked down the emperor.
1:54:30|1:54:37|It showed its sharp claws and reached for the Emperor's eyes, blinding him.
1:54:37|1:54:40|Hearing the Emperor's screams, the demon cat gleefully completed the first step of revenge.
1:54:40|1:54:45|Emperor was actually blinded by the demon cat. Upon hearing the truth, [Bai Letian] was in a panic.
1:55:38|1:55:50|Faced with the roar of [Bai Letian], the demon cat only weakly responded and then left. The words of [Kong Hai] made it pause, but it did not answer, and finally it left with its head drooping.
1:55:51|1:56:3|It returned to the cave at the cliff edge in a daze. Just as it arrived at the entrance, it seemed to see [Yang Yuhuan] standing under the cherry blossom tree in splendid attire, with a smile on her face. It was extremely excited, too overwhelmed to consider whether this was real.
1:56:4|1:56:11|It rushes towards [Yang Yuhuan]. One step, two steps, then it leaps, at this moment it only wants to fall into [Yang Yuhuan]'s arms, gently comforting her.
1:56:12|1:56:16|Just as it touched [Yang Yuhuan], [Yang Yuhuan] disappeared.
1:56:18|1:56:31|It let out a mournful cry, the sound echoing for a long time at the edge of the cliff. Suddenly, it rushed into the cave, and [Yang Yuhuan] was gone, she was actually gone, leaving only the jade hairpin picked up by [Bai Long] at the feast of paradise, and then disappeared.
1:56:31|1:56:42|The demon cat felt sorrow, anger, pain, and despair. All emotions surged up at once, and it let out a long roar towards the sky, then spat out a mouthful of blood.
1:56:42|1:56:51|The next morning, a watermelon and a box appeared in front of Master Konghai's house. Bai Letian picked up the watermelon, while Kong Hai held the box. The two of them entered the house, expressing their confusion.
1:56:54|1:57:0|[Bai Letian] was very puzzled, so he opened the box placed on the table by [Master Konghai].
1:57:0|1:57:6|Inside the box was a piece of paper with only four words written on it: "Feast of Paradise".
1:57:7|1:57:14|As agreed, the two pushed open the doors of the Huie Tower, and as soon as the doors opened, they saw the [Demon Cat] crouching at the entrance.
1:57:18|1:57:27|Just as [Bai Letian] lazily stretched his ribs, a bright light suddenly appeared behind him, accompanied by joyful sounds in his ears. In an instant, they were transported back to the magnificent and splendid feast of paradise 30 years ago.
1:57:27|1:57:43|[Bai Letian] was extremely excited as he watched the guests frolicking in front of him, dancers performing aerial dances, 7000 catties of fine wine poured into the Taiye Pool, [Yang Yuhuan] and [Tang Xuanzong] caressing the imperial cat while chatting and laughing, and the spirited young Baihe chasing in the hall.
1:57:45|1:57:49|Chasing and playing. [The Demon Cat] is leaping around in the hall, trying to carefully observe every detail.
1:57:49|1:57:58|It wants to return to the feast of paradise 30 years ago, and [Bai Letian] also looked at every scene in front of him with surprise. In the crowd, he finally saw the arrogant and unruly poetic immortal [Li Bai].
1:57:58|1:58:8|He saw him lying next to Taiye Pool, drinking wine leisurely with his legs crossed, and he also saw [Yang Yuhuan] looking back and saying that to [Li Bai].
1:58:27|1:58:36|The scene of the feast in paradise suddenly disappeared.
1:58:59|1:59:5|Following Guaweng's gaze, we pass through the now overgrown and desolate Taiye Pool, and arrive at a stone slab.
1:59:5|1:59:12|The body of [Yang Yuhuan] was lying quietly on the ground. [Bai Letian] immediately ran over.
1:59:12|1:59:21|He finally saw [Yang Yuhuan], the woman who haunted his dreams, finally appearing before his eyes. Just as the old lady had said.
1:59:21|1:59:28|[Bai Letian] ran up to [Master Konghai] almost in tears, asking.
1:59:57|2:0:6|The demon cat stared at its own body and the imperial concubine for a long time, tears welling up in its eyes.
2:0:19|2:0:38|Master Konghai's words awakened the demon cat, and it finally admitted that Yang Yuhuan was dead, shattering its obsession completely.
2:0:39|2:0:47|The old man lying on the ground asked the demon cat to kill him, but the demon cat showed its claws and then retracted them, choosing not to kill the old man.
2:0:47|2:0:55|At this moment, it let go of the obsession for revenge, turned around and walked past [Bai Letian] and [Kong Hai], bowing its head, because it didn't want them to see the tears in its eyes.
2:0:55|2:1:4|It slowly walked towards [Yang Yuhuan], no longer the demon cat that had harmed countless people, just an ordinary cat.
2:1:4|2:1:12|Gasping for breath, [Bai Long] finally reached the edge of the stone slab. With a leap, it tried to jump to the side of [Yang Yuhuan], but it was already too weak and fell down.
2:1:12|2:1:21|It refused to give up and jumped again, but ended up falling even harder, rolling several meters away. It lay on the ground gasping for breath, barely clinging to life.
2:1:21|2:1:27|[Bai Letian] and [Master Konghai] hurried to his side. Looking at the two, the demon cat finally spoke out his heart.
2:1:29|2:1:35|The two of them looked at it sadly, when suddenly the sound of a crane came from above.
2:1:35|2:1:44|The demon cat struggled for its last breath, lifting its head to meet the [White Crane]. It kept hovering in the dome of the palace, flapping its wings and shuttling under the golden sunlight.
2:1:45|2:1:48|Looking at the sudden appearance of [Bai He], the three of them had different expressions.
2:1:48|2:2:0|[Bai Letian] is puzzled, [Kong Hai] is relieved, while Guaweng is devoutly looking at it with hands clasped together. The demon cat lying on the ground seems to be influenced.
2:2:0|2:2:7|It looked up for a long time at the flying [White Crane] in the sky, then closed its eyes silently and peacefully fell to the ground.
2:2:7|2:2:14|Under their gaze, [Bai He] flew higher and higher, until it disappeared into the sunlight.
2:2:14|2:2:18|It flew away, taking the spirit of the demon cat with it.
2:2:19|2:2:33|When Bai Letian and Kong Hai regained consciousness, they found that the demon cat lying on the ground had already breathed its last breath, and strangely, the body of Bai Long had also disappeared. Kong Hai picked up the demon cat's body and gently placed it next to Yang Yuhuan's body.
2:2:33|2:2:40|The story of the 30-year-old demon cat and [Yang Yuhuan] came to an end. The next day,
2:2:40|2:2:52|[Bai Letian] and [Master Konghai] walked together on the bustling streets of Chang'an once again, as [Master Konghai] spoke.
2:3:16|2:3:22|[Bai Letian] finally confirmed his "Changhen Ge" without changing a word, and the two soon arrived at a tavern, where [Bai Letian] drank it all in one gulp.
2:3:22|2:3:32|Master Konghai couldn't help but speak up.
2:3:41|2:3:46|[Master Konghai] put down the wine in his hand, watching [Bai Letian] disappear into the crowd, and gave a heartfelt praise.
2:3:47|2:3:59|The ruthless and unscrupulous [Bai Letian] is now walking towards the sunset on the head of Chang'an Bridge. He has finally dispelled the clouds in his heart and no longer lives under the shadow of [Li Bai].
2:3:59|2:4:8|The bell of Daqing Long Temple rang again, [Master Konghai] came to the front of the temple once again before leaving.
2:4:14|2:4:22|He entered the Great Blue Dragon Temple as he wished, where the monks stood humbly with their hands clasped together on both sides of the hall. In the center stood a towering Arhat with a distinctive expression.
2:4:22|2:4:30|After walking through the hall and exchanging greetings with the monks in the inner hall, the monk who welcomed him said.
2:4:34|2:4:41|[Master Konghai], with a look of doubt, bid farewell to the monk and walked alone to the staircase, which happened to be behind a golden Buddha statue over 10 meters tall.
2:4:41|2:4:52|As he walked up the stairs to the second floor, Master Huiguo appeared behind him. [Kong Hai] sensed someone behind him and stopped in his tracks. The master stepped forward and looked at [Kong Hai]'s back, asking.
2:4:54|2:4:58|[Master Konghai] smiled knowingly, indeed Master Huiguo is [Dan Long], he turned around.
2:5:2|2:5:8|He took out the box that Master Konghai left at their doorstep last time, with "Feast of Paradise" written on it.
