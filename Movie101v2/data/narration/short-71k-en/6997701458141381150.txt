0:2:39|0:2:46|With the solemn voice of the envoy, General Aspar and his entourage arrived at the foot of the giant Buddha in a carriage.
0:3:16|0:3:25|Entering the pagoda, a massive bronze pillar reaching from the sky to the ground stood before them. [General Aspar] looked up, but couldn't see its top.
0:3:40|0:3:52|The giant Buddha is made of copper and iron, with no ventilation. At this time, many craftsmen are working on it, with molten metal and sparks exposed, making it unbearably hot.
0:3:52|0:4:1|Passing by the bronze pillar, General Aspar stood by and observed. Paintings hung all over the bronze body from top to bottom, and General Aspar, puzzled, spoke up and asked.
0:4:33|0:4:40|They looked around hesitantly and finally elected a round-faced man.
0:4:42|0:4:52|The speaker is the Minister of Works, [Jia Yi], who is also the one who supervised the construction of this sixty-six zhang tall Floating Tower to Heaven.
0:4:52|0:5:0|As the gears were turned by a dozen spirited horses, the few people standing in the wooden box slowly ascended.
0:5:16|0:5:21|In the meantime, the overseer and [Jia Yi] had reached the top level of the Great Buddha Temple, where [Jia Yi] continued to explain.
0:6:2|0:6:10|Having dealt with the overseer, [Jia Yi] smiled and walked towards the general. Just as she entered the Buddha's tomb, she suddenly felt dizzy and slowly said.
0:6:15|0:6:27|So the group of people crossed the mountains and arrived at the platform built under the pagoda. Just as [Jia Yi] said, the weather was clear today. Standing here, one could see Luoyang in the distance. General [Aspar] spoke up,
0:6:27|0:6:38|Built within the grand construction, overlooking the Hall of Enlightenment, one could see the grandeur of the imperial court.
0:6:39|0:6:55|Just at that moment, before the translator Shangguan Jing'er could finish speaking, flames suddenly burst out on the face of Jia Yi, emitting thick black smoke. Upon hearing this, everyone hurriedly dodged backwards, wanting to help but not knowing where to start.
0:6:56|0:7:0|In an instant, Di Renjie's body was engulfed in flames.
0:7:4|0:7:19|The searing pain caused him to scream, Jia Yi rushed in and ran onto the platform inside the giant Buddha, but the intense fire blinded him, making him unable to see. He stumbled and twisted, unable to wait for the onlookers to rescue him from the fire, and he fell down along the central pillar.
0:7:19|0:7:33|Although the giant Buddha statue is over 66 zhang high, it only took a moment for it to fall and completely incinerate the remains of Jia Yizhi. By the time it landed at the feet of the Buddha, it had turned into countless ashes.
0:7:33|0:7:41|Only a few bone fragments remained, causing astonishment and fear in the eyes of the officials, envoys, and supervisors present.
0:7:42|0:7:59|As the Empress is about to declare herself Emperor and build the Tower of Shang Heaven to proclaim her rule to the world, such a disturbance has occurred. Under the broad daylight, the Assistant Minister of Works, [Yu Qing], burned himself to death in front of foreign envoys, a scene too gruesome to behold. Therefore, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, [Xue Yong], led a team to the scene to investigate.
0:7:59|0:8:8|The Dali Temple is the highest judicial institution of the Tang Dynasty, responsible for handling all criminal cases and investigations.
0:8:24|0:8:30|Upon arriving at the pagoda, Di Renjie and his companions found that the craftsmen were all uninterested in construction, standing around and watching.
0:9:1|0:9:7|[Xue Yong] had just finished speaking when the figure in black sheathed his sword. With a loud shout, he leaped off the platform and looked around at the crowd, saying,
0:9:54|0:10:2|The room erupted in an uproar as the words were spoken, with servants either grimacing in complaint or shoving and cursing. The man in black is known as [Pei Donglai], in his prime yet holding the position of Deputy Minister of Justice.
0:10:20|0:10:33|Pei Donglai moved forward and subdued the overseer, examining his left hand. He noticed a copper hook sleeve revealing a severed hand.
0:10:47|0:10:56|[Pei Donglai] smirked and exerted a bit of force on the overseer Xiang's back, casually tossing the bronze hook into the stable.
0:11:38|0:11:48|Upon hearing Di Renjie's words, Xue Yong followed his pointing finger and looked towards the central pillar, where two pages of talismans were lifted, revealing the true appearance of the bronze pillar.
0:11:48|0:12:10|[Pei Donglai] hesitated for a moment upon hearing the words, then reached out to take the peace charm painted by the national teacher. Just as he was about to grab it, Xue Yong quickly stepped forward and tore off the talisman. Feeling slightly uneasy, [Pei Donglai] confronted Xue Yong and forcefully tore off the second talisman.
0:12:21|0:12:28|At a command, the relevant individuals were all placed in shackles under the pagoda, [Pei Donglai] was about to interrogate the overseer, but then heard Xue Yong speak.
0:12:35|0:12:43|Xue Yong and others galloped towards the imperial city.
0:12:43|0:13:2|In the inner city training ground during the martial arts selection, numerous miracles were displayed on the walls of the corner tower. Outside the city tower's literary cave, drums resounded, and on the training ground stood a woman clad in golden armor, wearing a peony and phoenix crown, mounted on a horse among many generals and soldiers. She was none other than the empress dowager [Wu Zetian].
0:13:24|0:13:54|Only [Wu Zetian] waved her hand, the majestic dragon's might gathered in the phoenix's grandeur. On the other side, Xue Yong rode his horse on the training ground, feeling the scorching sun unbearable. [Pei Donglai] dismounted and prostrated himself in front of [Wu Zetian]. Suddenly, a scream came from afar, and a figure engulfed in smoke appeared on a spirited horse, it was the skeptical Xue Yong. A female guard beside [Wu Zetian] spoke up.
0:13:56|0:14:6|Immediately after withdrawing before the imperial carriage, there was smoke swirling around, with a twisted and terrifying face. The female guard observed his actions and saw that he was heading straight towards [Wu Zetian].
0:14:6|0:14:28|So the husband galloped forward, blocking the way, confronting the source of fire. He finally stopped it in front of the imperial carriage, with [Di Renjie] falling under the horse. The female guard, hit by the impact, lost her balance. The soldiers then reacted, surrounding [Di Renjie] with their horses, but none dared to risk their lives to save him. They could only watch as he was devoured almost completely.
0:14:28|0:14:33|After nightfall, heavy rain poured down, thunder striking the pagoda, causing fear in the hearts of the people.
0:14:57|0:15:11|In the study, before the six memorials were presented, [Wu Zetian] reclined on the couch, while the attendants rode in a boat slowly towards the palace in the early hours of the morning. Upon meeting, numerous compliments were exchanged, and [Wu Zetian] spoke frankly.
0:15:18|0:15:26|The speaker has a delicate face, with a charming and gentle appearance, but surprisingly, she is the female bodyguard who sacrificed herself to protect the master on the training ground earlier.
0:16:12|0:16:39|This person, known as [Shangguan Jing'er], is a prominent figure by [Wu Zetian]'s side, skilled in martial arts and extremely loyal. She takes care of all aspects of [Wu Zetian]'s daily life. Watching the obedient Jing'er kneeling before her, [Wu Zetian] couldn't help but gently stroke her cloud-like hair. Just as they exchanged smiles as master and servant, a commotion broke out among the palace guards, and a group of palace maids followed [Wu Zetian] to the bridge.
0:16:39|0:16:46|A plum blossom deer stood majestically on the steps of the corridor.
0:17:54|0:18:12|[Wu Zetian] finished speaking, and was immediately questioned by Jing'er, so she left. One must not go against one's word, so Jing'er changed into plain clothes, and that night she rode her horse to the place where [Di Renjie] was being tortured, dismounted and revealed her waist badge.
0:19:4|0:19:11|The young man suddenly stopped in his tracks and hesitated before saying,
0:19:18|0:19:26|The firelight reflected on their faces, only then did they realize that the old and the young had no pupils in their eyes, but relied on hearing to perceive the sound of the wind breaking around them.
0:19:42|0:19:58|As soon as the words fell, a night walker rushed up to the burning platform, lifted the two people around the waist, and threw them directly into the furnace. The two remained calm in the face of danger, using the wooden clogs they were wearing to connect to the outer wall of the incinerator, and then throwing themselves backwards. The night walker, unable to control his force, rushed towards the incinerator, reaching out and touching the wall of the furnace.
0:19:58|0:20:14|Unexpectedly, the burning furnace never ceases day and night, with the walls scorching hot. In a moment of carelessness, a night traveler is thrown off a high platform. At this moment, the young man reaches out and squeezes the two thin films covering the eyes, abandoning them on the platform.
0:20:14|0:20:25|The eyes were bright and piercing, showing no signs of blindness, just pretending to be blind. All five senses were intact, and the young man could see everything in the circle clearly. Just then, two more night travelers appeared.
0:20:25|0:20:26|Di Renjie returns with his sword in hand.
0:20:27|0:20:49|Old Lin controlled the half-burning cart, turned around towards the stage below. Two night travelers who couldn't react in time were knocked down. On the stage, a night traveler drew a ice blade, while the young man used the handcuffs in his hand as a weapon, facing four night travelers alone. He first delivered a powerful punch to the chest of one person, then avoided the handle of the knife, and kicked the person on the right wing with his legs together.
0:20:49|0:20:57|With the pressure of Mount Tai, he fell onto another person, but when he turned around, he saw a night walker swinging a knife towards Old Lin.
0:21:4|0:21:29|Just as the young man relaxed and smiled, two night prowlers, fearless of death, charged forward. [Shangguan Jing'er] heard the noise and rushed over, solemn as snow, moving back and forth like a silver dragon. In her hand was a long whip with a golden python pattern, striking like the wind and thunder. As she moved up and down, it was like a dance of a golden snake and phoenix. Finally, the guards arrived, drawing their swords and shouting.
0:21:32|0:21:50|Immediately, soldiers surrounded [Shangguan Jing'er] to protect her. As soon as the words fell, several arrows whistled through the air. Everyone hurriedly called for others to take cover and the young man remained vigilant against the surrounding assassins. Seeing them charging towards the burning building, he shouted.
0:21:55|0:22:7|Taking advantage of the chaos among the guards, the assassins who had arrived at the door lifted their dead or injured companions and threw them into the furnace. Then, they themselves leaped into the raging fire.
0:22:18|0:22:23|The battle ended, the young man led the old Lin down from the burning platform, and they sat on the ground to rest.
0:22:50|0:22:58|[Shangguan Jing'er] stepped forward and reached out to test Lao Lin, but was stopped by the young man who said,
0:23:51|0:24:17|Upon finishing speaking, Lao Lin stared at [Shangguan Jing'er] with his eyes that seemed to have no pupils, smiling sinisterly as if he could see even clearer despite being blind. It was then realized that the young man was none other than [Di Renjie], known as the Pearl of the Sea and the Southeastern Treasure. The scene gradually faded away within Lao Lin's eerie smile, leading to the early morning of the next day.
0:24:32|0:24:51|Before the Mingtang, thousands of Imperial Guards stood in strict formation, with the palace tightly guarded. Two men engaged in combat in the open space before the hall, only to catch the attention of the Empress. Eunuchs and palace maids patrolled the streets of Futu, while [Shangguan Jing'er] changed into a black robe and knelt before the Empress.
0:25:19|0:25:34|With a hint of surprise and a moment of hesitation, [Shangguan Jing'er] followed the eunuchs and left directly. When the attendants withdrew, the Empress waved her hand as a signal. [Di Renjie] then sat down beside the frame, despite being in prisoner's garb, with a dirty appearance. However, in front of the Empress, he maintained a calm and dignified demeanor, not losing the air of a distinguished official.
0:26:20|0:26:40|The two seemed to deliberately avoid the distinction of seniority and did not mention the past bloody battles. Their casual conversation seemed to set aside the ongoing struggle on the field, catching the attention of [Shangguan Jing'er]. After speaking, she opened [Di Renjie]'s palm and placed a badge inside, saying to him,
0:26:53|0:27:0|Standing in front of the tent, [Shangguan Jing'er] may or may not have heard what the Empress said.
0:27:0|0:27:28|With a pensive expression, the scene shifts to outside the palace walls. The long river runs through the capital, dividing it in two. The river is wide and bustling with boats, while on the shore within the city, the sounds of martial arts competitions fill the air. In the midst of the prosperous era of the Great Tang Dynasty, with the nation's prestige soaring, clusters of businesses and foreign tourists can be seen everywhere on the streets. [Shangguan Jing'er], holding an imperial decree, leaves the palace with [Di Renjie] to handle a case.
0:27:32|0:27:43|[Di Renjie] knew in his heart that the Empress had reservations about reinstating him, so he placed [Shangguan Jing'er] by his side with the intention of surveillance.
0:28:4|0:28:11|The two walked and talked in the corridors of the Four Square Pavilion, and soon arrived at the room of [Di Renjie].
0:28:20|0:28:29|After saying that, the door behind Di Renjie slowly closed, but Shangguan Jing'er's voice could still be heard.
0:28:34|0:28:58|After that, she walked into the room and directly took off her official attire behind a screen without any hesitation. With a question in the air, [Di Renjie] didn't say much, sitting in front of a bronze mirror. Not long after, [Shangguan Jing'er] changed into women's clothing and emerged from behind the screen. Hearing the movement, [Di Renjie] turned around to check, sizing up the person behind him without much surprise on his face. Instead, he took the initiative to speak first.
0:29:4|0:29:10|[Shangguan Jing'er] had a displeased look on her face. Apart from the Empress, she had never served anyone else in the world.
0:29:20|0:29:28|[Shangguan Jing'er] kicked backwards, sending the long whip hanging on the clothes rack flying into the air. She leaped onto a low table, turned around, and grabbed it.
0:29:28|0:29:39|Taking the long whip into his hand, [Di Renjie] saw [Shangguan Jing'er] charging towards him. He drank a mouthful of cold water and sprayed it on her face, leaving [Shangguan Jing'er] feeling both embarrassed and angry. She swung the long whip towards him, but it was snatched away by [Di Renjie].
0:29:39|0:29:54|With the razor handed to himself, [Di Renjie] leaned his head back towards [Shangguan Jing'er]'s damp face, indicating for her to shave his beard for him.
0:30:44|0:31:3|After that, [Shangguan Jing'er] turned around and rode on [Di Renjie], then took off the hairpin on her head, causing her hair to flow like a waterfall. Finally, she undressed calmly to face him, but to her surprise, [Di Renjie] remained unmoved under her, calmly saying.
0:31:4|0:31:9|[Shangguan Jing'er] remained silent, took out the razor from her mouth, and asked in return.
0:31:9|0:31:20|She then skillfully used a hairpin to pick the lock on the already loose prison clothes of [Di Renjie] beneath her, just as [Shangguan Jing'er] was anxiously preparing for another move.
0:31:20|0:31:31|Underneath her, [Di Renjie] suddenly embraced her, and the two who had only met briefly were instantly close to each other. Even a heroine like [Shangguan Jing'er] felt weak all over, despite her martial arts skills.
0:31:31|0:31:38|Transformed into mud. While the room was filled with soft jade, warmth, and delicacy, [Di Renjie] handed the whip to [Shangguan Jing'er].
0:31:38|0:31:50|Shortly after stepping out and closing the door behind them, countless arrows came whistling through the air. The two hurriedly dodged, with [Shangguan Jing'er] dragging her whip along the ground and hiding behind a beam, then spoke up.
0:31:52|0:32:7|Outside the house, arrows kept coming. After [Di Renjie] finished speaking, he extinguished a candle beside him, then swiftly threw the knife in his hand to extinguish the last light. The room instantly plunged into darkness. The assassins outside lost their target, shot randomly towards the house, and then fell silent.
0:32:7|0:32:28|The two remained unchanged and hidden in the room, suddenly on the side of [Shangguan Jing'er]'s window, someone walked with a candle. She turned to look, then followed the light and shadow, chased to the door, and saw the person outside with the candle stop. She wanted to open the door to see what was going on, but as soon as she opened a crack, she was pulled back by [Di Renjie] by the shoulder.
0:32:28|0:32:47|Outside the house, countless arrows broke through the air and shot straight at the two of them. In a moment of desperation, [Di Renjie] hung his official robe in front of him, catching the arrows in the flowing robe. As they fell to the ground, just as [Di Renjie]'s arm was about to touch the back of [Shangguan Jing'er]'s head, he immediately, without hesitation, rolled away from the spot, still naked.
0:32:47|0:32:56|[Di Renjie] looked at her, feeling quite puzzled. This small gesture now seemed like a drop in the ocean compared to before, but [Shangguan Jing'er]'s strong reaction was beyond his understanding.
0:32:56|0:33:23|[Di Renjie] secretly took notice and then caught a glimpse of a clue in the hidden arrows. He then broke open a birdcage at his feet, picked up the small bird with an arrow still in its wing, and examined it in his palm. As the roof tiles moved, [Di Renjie] didn't care about anything else, quickly placed the bird down and immediately turned and rushed out of the room, following the assassin's trail. He arrived at another courtyard, where he saw a room full of guests and heavy guards.
0:34:12|0:34:17|As soon as the words fell, there was a loud explosion in the air, and the military token disappeared. Then a figure descended from the sky.
0:34:48|0:34:54|The guests left with sarcastic remarks, but [Shangguan Jing'er] remained indifferent and spoke directly to [Di Renjie].
0:35:47|0:35:56|Di Renjie looked up at the sky, saw dark clouds obscuring the sun, and in no time, Pei Donglai led Di Renjie and Shangguan Jing'er to the morgue.
0:35:59|0:36:2|As Di Renjie pushed open the door, he heard the constant chirping of a small bird in the cage.
0:36:2|0:36:10|[Di Renjie] looked at the charred corpse in the room and then at the birdcage in his hand, and said,
0:36:11|0:36:24|Pei Donglai, unaware of the deeper meaning, felt helpless and handed the birdcage to a subordinate to look after. The three of them then entered the morgue, where the coroners lit candles and unrolled a scroll between the two charred bodies, beginning to recite.
0:36:38|0:36:55|[Di Renjie] asked Pei Donglai without success, realizing that this person was cautious in his words and actions, fearing the authority of the Empress. He then turned to [Shangguan Jing'er] and spoke, [Shangguan Jing'er] glanced over, and Pei Donglai responded.
0:37:0|0:37:6|[Di Renjie] spoke while placing the badge between the two of them, speaking earnestly. [Shangguan Jing'er] had no choice but to leave.
0:37:13|0:37:27|The so-called evidence is the little sparrow, and the words about closing the door were meant for [Shangguan Jing'er]. Closing the door, [Shangguan Jing'er] stood with a sword behind her, angrily outside the house, then came up with a plan, looking up at the roof and continuing to ponder.
0:37:39|0:37:47|In the room, the imperial envoy [Di Renjie] made the coroner read the scroll in his hand until he was hoarse. Only then did [Di Renjie] lean in and whisper in Pei Donglai's ear.
0:37:48|0:37:55|Pei Donglai was quite surprised, carefully examining the person in front of him. With a wise and firm expression on his face, he tentatively spoke,
0:38:1|0:38:24|Outside, [Shangguan Jing'er] had already climbed onto the roof. As the two were talking softly, [Shangguan Jing'er] lifted a roof tile to look inside the house. Although the figure of the person could be seen and the sound of recitation could be heard, it was difficult to make out what the two were saying.
0:38:51|0:38:56|Pei Donglai heard these words and knew that the person in front of him was not easily fooled, and was solely focused on solving the case regardless of anything else.
0:39:13|0:39:17|Pei Donglai hesitated to continue, then slightly tilted his head to signal and spoke.
0:39:23|0:39:40|[Di Renjie] nodded solemnly, and Pei Donglai immediately raised his voice, bursting into laughter. He then wiped the smirk off his face and asked [Di Renjie] in return.
0:40:24|0:40:27|When Di Renjie asked in confusion, Pei Donglai, with a smug look on his face, replied,
0:40:29|0:40:42|During the confrontation between [Di Renjie] and [Wu Zetian], as dark clouds dispersed in the sky outside the room, the scorching sun shone into the hall. At that moment, a guard who was watching over a small bird outside suddenly shouted,
0:40:54|0:41:6|[Di Renjie] thought for a moment and then led the group over. One guard held a black umbrella over [Pei Donglai]'s head as they walked to the kitchen, where [Di Renjie] asked,
0:41:14|0:41:31|Under the ink umbrella, [Pei Donglai] responded to [Shangguan Jing'er] that he does not like the bright sun, perhaps this ink umbrella is the reason for his snow-white appearance. [Di Renjie] walked to the side of the kitchen case, found the bowl of chicken blood placed in front of him, took out two arrows from his bosom, and observed that their appearance was exactly the same as the ones used by the assassin last night.
0:41:31|0:41:40|A hidden weapon. The arrowhead twisted and turned, revealing a hollow interior from which a colorless liquid trickled into the bowl of chicken blood.
0:41:58|0:42:12|At this point, [Di Renjie] carried the blood-stained object out into the sun, placed it on the table, and bent down to examine it. As the liquid in the bowl began to boil, [Di Renjie] waved his hand to signal everyone to step back three feet away from the blood bowl.
0:42:12|0:42:13|Under the bright sun, 
0:42:13|0:42:26|But the blood in the bowl kept splashing, with black smoke swirling around it. Not knowing its power, the crowd retreated again to prevent any unnecessary disasters. After a moment, countless bubbles emerged from the boiling heat in the accumulated blood.
0:42:26|0:42:29|Soon after, there was a loud explosion.
0:42:29|0:42:41|[Pei Donglai] felt the sudden surge of flames in front of him, unbearable. He quickly used an ink umbrella to shield himself. In just a moment, all the vegetables and goods on the shore were engulfed in flames, revealing the secret of spontaneous combustion.
0:42:41|0:42:59|The three then arrived at the Tower of Babel to search for clues. With [Wu Zetian] about to ascend the throne, despite unsolved murders, the construction of the tower remained in high demand. Therefore, craftsmen still sat within it, by the water pool. As a worker attempted to pour water into the lake, a colleague said this.
0:42:59|0:43:17|The leather pot slipped from the hand and fell into the pool, floating on the water. Just as he was about to pick it up, he saw an arm picking up the leather pot and putting it into the wall pool. Following that arm, the supervisor's face suddenly froze, with a complex expression. The person in front of him was none other than [Di Renjie].
0:43:18|0:43:25|After a startled cry from the overseer, there was a pause before he spoke.
0:43:27|0:43:36|Di Renjie scrutinized, and Shangguan Jing'er spoke up.
0:43:41|0:43:49|Not far away, [Pei Donglai] said to [Shangguan Jing'er].
0:43:58|0:44:3|Little did [Shangguan Jing'er] know, full of pride, she bluntly refused and then walked away from him.
0:44:3|0:44:14|At that moment, [Pei Donglai] had a sudden inspiration. He took the copper pot from his waist and placed it between his nose and mouth, showing no abnormalities. However, this simple action triggered countless thoughts, focusing on the water pool nearby.
0:44:14|0:44:25|Shangguan Jing'er saw him looking pensive, so she turned around and stood in front of him, asking.
0:45:34|0:45:40|As they walked to the central pillar, [Di Renjie] couldn't help but exclaim.
0:46:10|0:46:25|[Di Renjie] saw some charred bone fragments on a table in the pavilion, stood on the left eye platform of the giant Buddha, and asked, then turned his head and chuckled before replying.
0:47:36|0:47:41|[Shangguan Jing'er] heard the sarcastic remarks and burst into laughter.
0:48:53|0:49:10|The original overseer, known as Shatuo, once worked at the Dali Temple and was a trusted assistant of [Di Renjie]. After bidding farewell to Shatuo, [Di Renjie] and his companions rushed to the entrance of the Ghost Market. On the vast desolate plain, a huge crack meandered endlessly, disappearing into the depths, where a dark river flowed and thin mist lingered.
0:49:10|0:49:18|[Di Renjie] shook a bronze bell in front of him. In a moment, smoke rose above the underground river, and an old man rowed a boat towards them, his voice hoarse as he spoke.
0:49:32|0:49:49|Three people walked on the boat, following the old man into the ghost market. Soon they delved deep into the market. On both sides of the river, there were countless people in tattered robes, hiding their forms. These people, who had long lived underground and rarely seen the light of day, were strangely similar to [Pei Donglai], with fair skin as white as snow and eerie appearances.
0:49:49|0:50:6|They gathered around a stone platform, with candles lit around it. Feasting on the bodies on the platform without any hesitation, tearing and swallowing as if it were normal. Moving along the water, they encountered a person with six arms, playing musical instruments with both hands, the music sorrowful and haunting with a calm expression, truly chilling. They continued on in silence.
0:50:6|0:50:31|Three people arrived outside a pavilion, where the beams and pillars were disorderly and chaotic, with no apparent order. Shrouded in thin mist, it gave a feeling of imminent collapse. [Pei Donglai] seemed to understand it well, as he entered the pavilion and called for someone, but received no response. The sound of pounding medicine led the group into a room, where they saw an old man sitting in front of a furnace, with a short, bloated, and filthy appearance.
0:50:31|0:50:37|The old man looked up at everyone and said directly to [Di Renjie],
0:50:45|0:50:53|After saying that, the old man reached into the jar, took out a centipede, and swallowed it.
0:51:11|0:51:32|He threw a jar at [Shangguan Jing'er], and several baby-sized scorpions fell out from under her feet. Upon hearing [Di Renjie]'s words, [Pei Donglai], who had just dealt with those poisonous creatures, took off his money pouch from his waist and placed it on the Dan Ding. [Wang Lu] heard the sound and came over, staring at the gold cakes in the pouch with shining eyes, and casually said.
0:51:33|0:51:38|As soon as [Di Renjie] heard these words, he immediately became alert, gathering his thoughts before hesitantly speaking.
0:51:49|0:51:57|[Di Renjie] squatted in front of Wang Lu, smiling and waving the gold cake in his bag in front of him.
0:52:7|0:52:26|Just as the two were talking, a strange noise came from the top of the pavilion. The exotic beast in the cage inside the room kept howling. The four looked up and saw a huge bell falling heavily, heading straight towards Di Renjie. In the urgent situation, everyone dodged in different directions, raising countless dust.
0:52:26|0:52:31|Taking advantage of the chaos, Di Renjie leaped into the secret passage under the floor, disappearing without a trace.
0:52:31|0:52:43|[Di Renjie] pushed open the bronze bell blocking the way with all his strength, then leaped into the secret passage. On the other side, [Pei Donglai] reached the steps and looked up, noticing shadows moving among the complex beams. He then spoke,
0:52:44|0:52:59|While in the midst of investigation, feeling no one following behind, Di Renjie turned around and shouted at [Shangguan Jing'er]. [Shangguan Jing'er] then entered the secret passage, causing the group to abandon the pursuit of the assassin and instead track down Wang Lu, ensuring his safety.
0:52:59|0:53:19|On the other side of the underground river, Di Renjie sat in a boat prepared in advance, paddling forward. After a smooth glide, he suddenly felt a chill under his feet. Looking down, he saw a small hole in the bottom of the boat, from which water was rushing in frantically. Just as Di Renjie was about to start clearing the water in the cabin, a huge wooden stake suddenly flew out from the underground river.
0:53:19|0:53:37|Di Renjie's boat collided with the stern, causing a violent shake. Before Wang Lu could react, wooden stakes flew out from under the water, directly hitting the boat into the air and then crashing back down onto the water. Startled, Wang Lu looked up to see more than ten wooden stakes falling from the sky, smashing into the water and creating countless waves.
0:53:37|0:53:57|Just as Di Renjie was relieved that he was unharmed after the attack, he saw countless wooden stakes falling from the sky. This time, a person stood on top of a stake and then fell down, overturning Di Renjie's boat and smashing it into the water. The person was tall and muscular, wearing a blood-red robe and a sinister ghost mask on his face, mysterious and enigmatic.
0:53:57|0:54:16|He saw Wang Lu preparing to escape, so he flew up in a tiger-claw stance, pressing directly towards Wang Lu's back. The palm wind was so strong that the several-inch-thick plank was shattered like foam. The ghost-faced man grabbed Wang Lu, but found himself unable to drag him over with such strange strength. When he turned around, he saw a person standing in front of Wang Lu, who was none other than [Di Renjie].
0:54:16|0:54:31|At this critical moment, he quickly snatched Wang Lu from the hands of the ghost-faced man, then joined forces with the two companions who arrived, only to find that the ghost-faced man was incredibly strong, even facing three opponents at once without falling behind. [Shangguan Jing'er] wielded her long whip like a swimming dragon, forcibly tearing off one of the ghost-faced man's arms.
0:54:31|0:54:52|Entangled with [Di Renjie], the pressure on him suddenly decreased. However, after the arm detached from the body, it transformed into two blood-robed monsters hidden in the dark cave walls, shooting arrows out of thin air. [Shangguan Jing'er] dodged quickly. Looking at the ghostly figure, incredibly eerie and able to regenerate in a matter of moments, [Pei Donglai] flew past, astonished.
0:54:52|0:54:54|Beside her, [Shangguan Jing'er] answered confidently.
0:54:54|0:55:13|[Di Renjie] took advantage of the chaos to circle behind the Ghost-Faced Man, kicking a wooden stake towards him. Unexpectedly, the Ghost-Faced Man seemed to have eyes on the back of his head, reaching back without looking to push the stake down. Failing in his initial plan, [Di Renjie] then drew the attention towards himself, while [Shangguan Jing'er] used her whip to bind the Ghost-Faced Man to the stake.
0:55:13|0:55:38|Just when [Pei Donglai] thought that everyone had successfully bound him, the ghost-faced man on the wooden stake actually broke free from the restraints. He was seen trying to shed his skin again, causing chaos among the crowd. With his right hand gripping a snake-shaped short sword and his left hand holding a dark command flag, he stood fearless among the three people.
0:55:38|0:55:46|[Di Renjie] assessed the situation and knew that this person was not easy to deal with. He was concerned about the safety of Wang Lu and did not want to entangle with him further. He signaled [Pei Donglai] to feign an attack on the mysterious Ghost Face.
0:55:46|0:55:55|Taking advantage of their entanglement, [Di Renjie] hurriedly helped [Wang Lu] out of the water and said hastily,
0:55:55|0:56:16|After saying that, [Di Renjie] lifted Wang Lu and threw him into the nearby fallen wood area. Seeing this, [Pei Donglai], who was hiding in the dark, immediately stood up to protect Wang Lu. The Ghost Face Man realized he had been tricked, became furious, and threw wooden stakes at [Shangguan Jing'er] one after another. With the strength of ten thousand soldiers and tricky angles, [Shangguan Jing'er] narrowly avoided being hit, [Di Renjie] rushed forward to assist and engaged in a fight with the Ghost Face Man.
0:56:16|0:56:38|Just as he had just subdued its arms, the ghost-faced figure shed the restraints on its upper body again. However, this time the arms that retreated could not transform into human form. They fell straight into the water, and two strange fish escaped from the wide sleeves of the robe. Through the water's surface, their eyes emitted a penetrating light. The strange fish swam to the shore, leaped out, and transformed into a different appearance. It appeared as strong as a human, with all four limbs intact.
0:56:38|0:56:57|With a head like a demon vulture, wielding a curved blade and feet like long nails, possessing a formidable killing power, it headed straight for the donkey on the shore. [Pei Donglai] had just arrived and was unable to get close to protect, so he wielded his hand axe and easily split the monster in two with an unintentional blow. Before he could relax, he saw the monster flying up out of nowhere, baring its teeth and claws.
0:56:57|0:57:14|[Pei Donglai] immediately drew his sword and with great force, struck down the monster's head. He then stepped on the body and under the faint light, discovered that the monster was just a puppet controlled by threads. Looking up, he saw several assassins in the dark manipulating the monster with silk threads.
0:57:14|0:57:20|Pei Donglai was furious, as a high-ranking official of the Grand Court of the Tang Dynasty, he was unexpectedly embarrassed by such a trivial trick from the martial arts world.
0:57:20|0:57:27|He took out a wooden stake and threw it with all his might, directly breaking all the agile threads, rendering the monster immobile.
0:57:28|0:57:32|Seeing [Shangguan Jing'er] in a fierce battle, he turned to [Di Renjie] and said,
0:57:34|0:57:38|In this battle, the three of them cooperated seamlessly, having long put aside their past grievances and become companions to each other.
0:57:38|0:57:45|Pei Donglai picked up the hand axe and flew down from the high platform, forcing the masked man back, then fought side by side with Jing'er.
0:57:45|0:58:7|On the other side, after [Di Renjie] settled the donkey, he found many beams on the top here, messy and unstable, about to collapse. So he came up with a plan, shouted loudly to the two struggling below, and then clapped his hands to break the beams of the shed. Countless boards and timbers fell down, smashing the ghost-faced man and burying him.
0:58:7|0:58:31|During this break, the four of them gathered together for a brief rest. After a tough battle, Pei Donglai was sweating profusely but managed to catch his breath. Looking at the donkey in front of him, he asked, "Di Renjie, are you calm now?" Upon hearing Shangguan Jing'er's words, Di Renjie remained calm but deep in thought. Pei Donglai then lowered his voice and said,
0:58:31|0:58:45|The ghost-faced man was unharmed, searching around, when Jing'er realized that [Di Renjie] was staring at her intently. Feeling uncomfortable, she became angry, turned her head, broke through the wooden barrier in front of her, and rushed out.
0:59:3|0:59:10|[Di Renjie] rode his donkey towards the ground, preparing to leave the ghost market. [Pei Donglai] felt worried and could only silently follow behind him on the road.
0:59:11|0:59:16|On the other side, in the intricate underground caves, [Shangguan Jing'er] was alone, following the trail of the ghost-faced man.
0:59:16|0:59:24|In this unfathomable underground city, wherever one goes is dark and quiet, with ravines and cliffs everywhere. A slight carelessness could lead to being buried in the abyss.
0:59:24|0:59:38|While Di Renjie and his companions were on the road, Pei Donglai suddenly heard a strange laughter in the distance. Concern for Shangguan Jing'er rose in his heart once again. He stopped in his tracks, hesitated for a moment, then turned around to go help Shangguan Jing'er.
0:59:38|0:59:46|[Pei Donglai] returned to a vast underwater area along the original route, losing track of the two individuals. Fortunately, a long whistle was heard in the distance.
0:59:46|0:59:52|Turning his head and listening carefully, Di Renjie realized that the source of the sound was actually coming from the top of the cliff.
0:59:52|1:0:17|[Pei Donglai] raised his head and carefully examined the numerous abandoned halls on the cliffs on both sides. The walls were carved with niches by human hands, with fires burning inside for illumination. Despite the countless dangers, there was still room for climbing. After a difficult journey, [Pei Donglai] climbed into a passage on the cliff. In its depths, he heard some movement and immediately became alert, taking three gold needles from his waist and holding them in his hand.
1:0:17|1:0:35|On the other side of the corridor, [Pei Donglai] suddenly sensed something amiss. He concealed himself behind the cave wall, gathered his energy in his lower abdomen, and prepared to strike. He then threw a hidden weapon to attract attention and ran wildly after it. When they reached the corner, he sent out his hand axe. As soon as the two met face to face, their weapons clashed, and only then did he realize the identity of the other person.
1:0:35|1:0:41|Each of them took their weapons. [Shangguan Jing'er] leaned against the wall, and [Pei Donglai] anxiously asked,
1:0:42|1:1:6|Without waiting for him to finish speaking, [Shangguan Jing'er] saw [Pei Donglai] reach out in front of her. Pei Donglai knew that the ghost-faced person must be deep in the corridor, so he took off the hollow incense burner from his waist and threw it forward. The copper burner rolled on the ground in a spherical shape, with the fire stones and licorice rubbing against each other, creating sparks that illuminated the location of the ghost-faced person in a moment. Pei Donglai immediately flew after him, following the ghost-faced person through the grass and out of the corridor.
1:1:6|1:1:15|Unexpectedly, outside the corridor was a cliff. The ghost-faced man disappeared after rushing out, leaving [Pei Donglai] in a tough spot. Without any precautions, he accidentally stepped into the air and fell off the cliff.
1:1:15|1:1:37|Fortunately, there were numerous trees at the bottom of the cliff. [Pei Donglai] regained consciousness, relied on his light skills, used tree branches as cushioning, landed safely without any harm, then quickly stood up, alert to his surroundings. He found that the mysterious masked man had already disappeared. Upon closer inspection, he noticed a bright light coming from deep within the woods, and in front of him, there was a stone tablet faintly inscribed with words.
1:1:37|1:1:43|[Pei Donglai] took out a fire starter, lit it, and carefully examined it. [Pei Donglai] whispered as he read the words carved on the stone tablet.
1:1:48|1:1:58|It turns out that this is the place where the current national teacher Lu Liching practices, but why did [Pei Donglai] jump from the top of the Ghost Market to arrive at the Wuji Temple?
1:1:58|1:2:6|The next day, [Di Renjie] returned to the city of Luoyang with Wang Lu, and they arrived outside an unfinished foreign church, remaining vigilant along the way.
1:2:28|1:2:37|Wang Lu was seen pulling out several silver needles from behind his head while speaking, causing his facial features to contort continuously and his appearance to change drastically.
1:3:3|1:3:33|Upon hearing these words, [Di Renjie] was plunged into memories of a similar night at the Sifang Pavilion, where [Shangguan Jing'er] had also spoken similar words. Before they could delve into details, a knock on the door interrupted them. Calming the startled Wang Lu, [Di Renjie] got up to answer the door, only to find [Pei Donglai] and [Shangguan Jing'er] outside. Having failed to find the murderer, the two returned together.
1:3:33|1:3:42|Stepping into the church, [Pei Donglai] was the first to notice the greatly changed appearance of Wang Lu, and asked in surprise,
1:4:21|1:4:31|[Shangguan Jing'er], with a strong personality, couldn't tolerate Wang Lu's disrespectful words. In an instant, she whipped Wang Lu and hung him up on a nearby scaffold. [Di Renjie] quickly stepped forward and grabbed a section of the whip.
1:4:46|1:4:52|This time, when [Shangguan Jing'er] seemed to have lost her temper, Wang Lu quickly spoke up.
1:6:34|1:6:52|The scene shifts to the imperial palace, where [Wu Zetian] overturns the chessboard in front of her and then stands up. Looking at [Shangguan Jing'er] who just delivered a message from [Di Renjie], she questions, the power of [Wu Zetian] is like rolling thunder in the clouds, unpredictable and inscrutable. [Shangguan Jing'er] kneels on the ground, trembling slightly, afraid to speak.
1:7:14|1:7:21|Upon hearing what [Wu Zetian] said, [Shangguan Jing'er] knew that she had made up her mind to eliminate [Di Renjie].
1:7:21|1:7:28|But for some reason, the current self was not afraid of angering [Wu Zetian], and instead felt a hint of.
1:7:28|1:7:35|Unexplained sorrow. The scene shifts to the bustling market within the city.
1:8:10|1:8:24|The streets were bustling with activity. [Di Renjie] and [Pei Donglai] sat on their horses, deducing the case. However, looking through the dense crowd, they saw that at the street corner, Wang Li Xiao of Langya was waiting with a group for a long time. Unlike [Di Renjie], Pei Donglai had to dismount when he saw the prince.
1:8:30|1:8:37|Li Xiao sat on the horse, one hand on his waist, staring straight at [Di Renjie], and then heard him say solemnly,
1:8:40|1:8:44|As soon as the words fell, a servant held out a long strip-like object with both hands.
1:8:46|1:9:0|[Di Renjie] watched as the servant pulled out the object and recognized it as the Dragon-Taming Staff bestowed by the late emperor. He quickly dismounted and knelt on the ground, hands raised above his head, ready to receive the staff. Li Xiao approached and handed the staff to [Di Renjie].
1:9:19|1:9:27|Di Renjie's memories surged for a moment, but he did not lose his rationality.
1:9:27|1:9:35|He looked up at Li Xiao and said.
1:9:42|1:9:51|Upon hearing Di Renjie's words, Li Xiao continued speaking in a calm and unhurried manner.
1:10:13|1:10:27|At this moment, a fierce demonic wind suddenly swept through the city, with yellow sand filling the market and animals becoming restless. Only [Di Renjie] listened to Li Xiao's words attentively. Even after Li Xiao left, [Di Renjie], who heard the news, remained kneeling on the ground, unable to calm down.
1:11:8|1:11:15|As soon as the words fell, Li Xiao, who was showing off on his forehead, was hit by an arrow from an unknown place, and fell on the chessboard without a sound.
1:11:19|1:11:24|Guests on the field panicked and fled in all directions, seeking refuge. At this moment, under the bright sun, Li Xiao and others were chatting on the terrace of the mansion.
1:11:26|1:11:35|Now Li Xia died from an arrow in the middle of the night, exposed to the sunlight, and in just a moment, his body was shrouded in smoke, eventually burning to ashes.
1:11:35|1:11:48|It is believed that the assassin plotting to kill King Li Xiao of Langya is likely the same group responsible for the previous two arson cases. The scene shifts to the interior of Sifang Pavilion, where night has fallen but the lights are still on, with music and dance in full swing.
1:11:48|1:11:57|The light gauze around the hall fluttered gently with the breeze, while the guests inside, dressed in luxurious attire, enjoyed exotic delicacies and exquisite wines.
1:11:57|1:12:3|In the courtyard outside the hall, [Di Renjie] stood leaning against the wall with the Konglongjian in his hand, lightly stroking the shaft as if lost in thought.
1:12:3|1:12:12|A maid in the hall passed by with a lantern, the flickering light shining on [Di Renjie]'s face, casting changing shadows, until the courtyard returned to darkness. He said,
1:12:13|1:12:21|[Di Renjie] finished speaking and saw a figure emerge from behind him, walking up the steps.
1:12:21|1:12:32|The person walked to the tree, where the magnolia flowers covered the branches. He stopped and carefully observed that the person in front of him was none other than the current Empress of the Great Tang, [Wu Zetian].
1:12:32|1:12:39|She pushed aside the flower branches and stared at the Dragon-Taming Staff, then asked [Di Renjie].
1:12:57|1:13:7|With his words matching his actions, [Di Renjie] wielded the Konglong Rod and struck it against the stone lamp beside him. Cracks appeared where it landed, spreading gradually throughout the entire lamp.
1:13:7|1:13:15|In the blink of an eye, the stone lamp shattered like being peeled layer by layer, falling into pieces and piling up on the ground.
1:13:37|1:13:50|Upon hearing Di Renjie's question, Shangguan Jing'er, who was hiding in the shadows, gestured and signaled. The Imperial Guards drew their bows and arrows, ready to shoot. Empress Wu Zetian, with a calm expression, looked at Di Renjie holding the tablet in his hands and spoke softly.
1:14:8|1:14:15|[Di Renjie] has a keen sense of hearing. The unusual sound of a taut bowstring enters his ears, but he remains calm and observes quietly.
1:15:3|1:15:18|Upon seeing the Imperial Guards, [Pei Donglai] knew that the Empress was present. He indicated his purpose and then dismounted and walked towards the courtyard. As the Empress walked past [Pei Donglai] with her back to [Di Renjie], [Shangguan Jing'er] led the others from the shadows near the Empress, ready with bows and arrows in case of any trouble.
1:15:25|1:15:30|Hearing that King Li Xiao of Langya has died, the Empress, with a look of shock on her face,
1:15:36|1:15:46|During this pause, [Di Renjie] immediately withdrew, causing a commotion among the Imperial Guards. The Empress turned her head and saw that all the soldiers were searching for [Di Renjie], except for [Shangguan Jing'er].
1:15:46|1:15:55|Smiling and looking in the direction he fled, she did not say much. The Empress Dowager only dispatched [Pei Donglai] to rush to the mansion of the Minister of Works, Jia Yizhi, overnight.
1:16:11|1:16:20|Madam Jia led [Pei Donglai] to the study, where now only remnants of the past remained, with scorched wood and dust scattered around.
1:16:37|1:16:43|The steward and maid hurried to take care and comfort, but heard [Pei Donglai] continue to ask.
1:17:14|1:17:34|Sensing that there was still potential to explore this clue, [Pei Donglai] couldn't wait to call on Jia Yi and the others to lead the way. So the group hurriedly rushed to Jia Yi's former office, with [Pei Donglai] being the first to run in. He searched frantically on the low table in the room, only to find it empty except for numerous scrolls and drawings of the four treasures of the study.
1:17:34|1:17:44|[Pei Donglai] carefully examined the documents, and one drawing caught his attention. As he carefully reviewed the file, his expression turned unusually stern, as if he had discovered something extraordinary.
1:17:44|1:17:53|Clue. After collecting the relevant physical evidence, [Pei Donglai] prepared to leave Jia Yi. He wrapped the scroll of paper in a bundle, stuffed it into a leather bag on the side of the saddle,
1:17:53|1:18:1|He tucked the most important clue he had found into his bosom, looked around vigilantly, then mounted his horse and rode away.
1:18:1|1:18:12|On the other side, fully focused on investigating the case, regardless of everything else, [Di Renjie] eventually took advantage of the night's cover, sneaking into the Wuji Temple to search for answers, throwing out iron hooks, connecting the walls, [Di Renjie] flipped over and entered.
1:18:12|1:18:31|Walking outside the main hall, they saw a bronze lotus-shaped cauldron on the sacrificial platform in front of the hall, with eight flagpoles raised. Going down the steps, there was a statue of the zodiac animals, solemn and dignified, but empty and quiet. On the other side, [Pei Donglai] rode his horse through the streets and alleys, preparing to bring back the evidence to the Supreme Court.
1:18:31|1:18:43|While walking on the road, Di Renjie always felt someone following him. Every time he turned around, he saw nothing. Suddenly, the sound of galloping hooves approached from behind. When he turned around again, he found five riders chasing after him in the night.
1:18:43|1:18:54|[Pei Donglai] was distracted and suddenly saw a carriage crossing the intersection ahead. He immediately pulled the reins to stop the horse and fell to the ground. Before he could catch his breath, a night traveler rushed towards him, and the two engaged in a fierce battle.
1:18:54|1:19:1|[Pei Donglai] hurriedly fought back, while the opponent's martial arts were strong and fierce like a tiger descending the mountain, forcing him to draw his sword and drive the opponent back.
1:19:1|1:19:8|[Pei Donglai] lifted his sword to reveal the black veil used by the night stalker, exposing a dark-skinned foreigner from Kunlun.
1:19:8|1:19:16|Just as [Pei Donglai] was taken aback, the other night stalkers soared into the air and dropped a large iron net, trapping him securely and rendering him immobile.
1:19:17|1:19:25|The Kunlun slave knocked [Pei Donglai] down with a sweeping leg kick, and in the blink of an eye, several toothed steel knives were placed at his neck. [Pei Donglai] was captured alive in an instant.
1:19:25|1:19:32|On the other side, inside the Wuji Palace, [Di Renjie] was still searching for the whereabouts of the National Master. Just as he was at a loss, a deer's cry came from the palace.
1:19:32|1:19:39|Soon after, a spotted deer appeared on the altar in front of the hall,
1:21:18|1:21:43|Upon hearing these words, the national teacher on the bronze tripod transformed his appearance drastically, pulling out several long needles from behind his head. He changed from a sturdy male figure to that of [Shangguan Jing'er]. Looking at the national teacher's attire with a blood-red robe draped over him, holding a silver snake short sword in his right hand and a dark command flag in his left, he bore a striking resemblance to the ghost-faced man. It's no wonder that [Pei Donglai] mistook him for the national teacher at that moment.
1:21:43|1:21:49|Seeing the national master restored to his original appearance, [Di Renjie] looked at the face of [Shangguan Jing'er] and continued speaking.
1:22:34|1:22:45|[Di Renjie] finished speaking, only to see [Shangguan Jing'er] with bloodshot eyes, tears of anger streaming down her cheeks. She then raised her head and let out a long howl, followed by the appearance of tree branch wind chimes in the Wuji Temple.
1:22:48|1:22:56|On the bronze tripod, [Shangguan Jing'er] waved the command flag, heading straight towards [Di Renjie], as the spiritual deer seemed to follow her orders and charged down to the square below the platform.
1:22:56|1:23:9|[Di Renjie] dodged the attack of the first deer, then drew his Konglong Ji from his waist and propped it on another deer's antler. Unexpectedly, this deer had immense strength. [Di Renjie] kept retreating until he bumped into two statues behind him and stopped.
1:23:9|1:23:21|Seeing the spiritual deer approaching again, [Di Renjie] quickly dodged, causing the two deer to collide, leaving one paralyzed on the side. He then flipped onto the beastman figurine, and as the spiritual deer leaped towards him, he swung his anti-dragon mace which was struck by the deer's antler.
1:23:21|1:23:35|The spiritual deer fell in pain from mid-air, knocked over the censer and fainted on the ground. As the censer rolled over, smoke filled the air, and [Di Renjie] jumped down from the beastman statue, covering his mouth and nose, looking surprised.
1:23:36|1:23:41|As soon as the words fell, [Shangguan Jing'er] leaped off the bronze tripod and ran towards the back of the hall.
1:23:41|1:24:3|Di Renjie hurriedly rushed out of the smoke, climbed onto the altar and chased after her. Whether it was the effect of the bewitching incense or the brilliant spell cast by Shangguan Jing'er, Di Renjie suddenly felt a bit dazed. The silk and satin in front of him seemed to come to life, and he recklessly rushed out, finding himself in a small courtyard with a Bagua diagram on the ground.
1:24:3|1:24:15|[Di Renjie] stepped forward, feeling as if the sky and earth were spinning around him. The entire courtyard seemed to be formed by countless long snakes coiled together, with no connection between them. Standing in the midst of it, he was entangled and surrounded by a writhing mass of snakes, extremely terrifying.
1:24:15|1:24:31|Just as [Di Renjie] was feeling uneasy, [Shangguan Jing'er] suddenly attacked from behind with her spirit snake short sword, catching him off guard. [Di Renjie] reacted quickly, narrowly avoiding [Shangguan Jing'er]'s fatal strike. In this illusionary realm, her martial arts skills were enhanced by eighty percent, leaving her to passively defend and counterattack.
1:24:31|1:24:42|After the lightning-fast exchange of blows, [Di Renjie] found himself staggering with cold sweat soaking his clothes, yet [Shangguan Jing'er] still couldn't harm him in the slightest. Seeing this, she decisively withdrew from the battlefield, and the two of them gazed at each other from a distance.
1:24:42|1:24:46|[Shangguan Jing'er] used the power of the bewitching fragrance to once again cast illusions on him.
1:24:46|1:24:53|At the moment their eyes met, it was as if time and space had twisted. In just a brief moment, [Di Renjie] found himself lost in a fantasy.
1:24:53|1:25:6|The illusion was so powerful that [Di Renjie] couldn't resist, feeling as if everything within sight was just a dream. [Shangguan Jing'er] attacked alone with her short sword, but in his eyes, it seemed like there were hundreds of figures coming at him with force.
1:25:6|1:25:23|The ground beneath his feet once again fell into turmoil, making it difficult for [Di Renjie] to protect himself. He fell to the ground, startled, and quickly rolled over, struggling to stand up. Just as he was at his weakest, [Shangguan Jing'er] launched an attack towards him. However, in the eyes of [Di Renjie] under the illusion, this action appeared as a different scene.
1:25:23|1:25:37|He felt a blood-colored silk shuttle around him in this fantasy world, extremely demonic. He saw the silk continuously rolling and smashing towards the stone pillars in the courtyard, [Di Renjie] had to do his best to dodge the impact of those huge stones.
1:25:37|1:25:56|The confrontation ended, [Di Renjie] was gasping for breath, finding it difficult to stand. He inserted his staff into the ground to support himself and calm down. He closed his eyes to regulate his breathing. [Shangguan Jing'er] stood on top of a stone pillar, observing with her sword in hand. Although she didn't know what [Di Renjie] was doing, seeing him close his eyes, she felt it was a perfect opportunity and thus rushed down.
1:25:56|1:26:11|At this moment, [Di Renjie] had completely calmed down, facing [Shangguan Jing'er] and her silver snake short sword. With a loud shout, the blade of the sword in [Shangguan Jing'er]'s hand broke off, hitting a stone pillar and bending back during their intense struggle.
1:26:12|1:26:27|[Di Renjie] felt a flash of sword light and knew the situation was critical. He pushed [Shangguan Jing'er] away, but couldn't dodge in time. The broken sword pierced his chest. [Shangguan Jing'er] did not realize [Di Renjie]'s noble act, accidentally knocking him unconscious. It wasn't until she sat on him that she discovered the short sword in his chest.
1:26:38|1:26:53|Looking at the unconscious Di Renjie beneath her, Shangguan Jing'er couldn't help but recall the words the Empress had said to him in the palace. Her heart was in turmoil, tears welling up in her eyes. With a long howl, she fiercely stabbed down with the broken sword held in both hands.
1:26:53|1:27:0|This series of actions almost exhausted all her strength, but [Shangguan Jing'er]'s face gradually became calm.
1:27:0|1:27:10|The broken sword is only a few inches away from Di Renjie, buried deep in the ground without a trace of blood. Shangguan Jing'er, lacking the ruthlessness, ultimately failed to follow the Empress's orders.
1:27:10|1:27:26|Early the next morning, [Shangguan Jing'er] quickly treated the arrow wound on [Di Renjie]'s chest, then dragged him away from Wuji Temple and into the nearby mountains. Her makeup was already smudged, and she hid [Di Renjie] in the wilderness, remaining vigilant of any movement around them.
1:27:39|1:28:7|Unaware of whose trap they had triggered, a bamboo pole pierced through [Shangguan Jing'er]'s abdomen, causing her lower body to go limp and her whole person to fall to the ground. Unexpectedly, she touched an almost invisible thread, causing the bamboo pole to pierce through her body again, splattering countless blood. Unable to support herself after being injured twice, [Shangguan Jing'er] knelt on the ground. After an unknown period of time, someone suddenly spoke in the tranquil mountain forest.
1:28:19|1:28:31|Soon after, the group quickly left the ambush area. Before long, they saw [Shangguan Jing'er] and [Di Renjie] falling from the mist-covered treetops. They had narrowly escaped danger, with [Shangguan Jing'er] already heavily injured.
1:28:31|1:28:35|After this ordeal, [Di Renjie] fell into a coma and regained consciousness at noon.
1:28:35|1:28:55|[Shangguan Jing'er] weakly spoke, her face pale, and she shook her head slowly as if her breath was as delicate as a thread.
1:29:12|1:29:34|After saying that, she gently placed her hand on [Di Renjie]'s neck, and [Di Renjie] also understandingly leaned towards her colored lips. Thus, [Di Renjie] took [Shangguan Jing'er] back to the outside of the palace walls in Luoyang City, found a white horse, and placed [Shangguan Jing'er] on its back. He watched as [Shangguan Jing'er] cried incessantly, but could only pat the horse's body and send [Shangguan Jing'er] into the imperial city.
1:30:14|1:30:29|The scene in the palace suddenly descended into chaos. Surrounded by a group of eunuchs, the Empress lost her usual composure and hurried to the Hall of Light. There, in front of the hall, lay a body covered in blood, none other than the once graceful and now extremely weak [Shangguan Jing'er].
1:30:40|1:30:45|The Empress held [Shangguan Jing'er] in her arms, and when she saw that she had something to say, she dismissed the attendants around her.
1:31:1|1:31:39|[Shangguan Jing'er] was reminded of certain past events by her words. She forced a smile and said, "The Empress and [Shangguan Jing'er] had a heart-to-heart talk. Although she is an empress, her heart is not made of stone. At this moment, she is in great pain." The Empress was reluctant to answer, but then she smiled and tidied up [Shangguan Jing'er]'s messy hair. The person in her arms asked straightforwardly and decisively.
1:31:39|1:31:45|Empress Wu Zetian firmly replied to this, and [Shangguan Jing'er] immediately went limp, dying in the Empress's arms.
1:31:45|1:32:11|For [Shangguan Jing'er], who has long lived in the deep palace, the word "love" is something she vaguely understands, but without a doubt, she loves the Empress. She was born for the Empress and is willing to die for her. Perhaps she also loves [Di Renjie]. When they met, the steel that had been tempered had turned into a tender sentiment of parting. Perhaps for [Shangguan Jing'er], this is the best outcome, neither harming [Di Renjie] in the slightest nor failing the Empress's trust.
1:32:12|1:32:35|At a time when the entire imperial city was overshadowed by the sorrow of the Empress, on the other side, [Di Renjie] cautiously sneaked into the Sifang Pavilion. He pushed aside the curtain and saw the horse ridden by [Pei Donglai] standing in the courtyard. After a moment of contemplation, [Di Renjie] believed that he should stay here on the Empress's orders. So he carefully proceeded to the residence, prepared to have a conversation with him. Walking on the corridor bridge, he unleashed his senses.
1:32:35|1:32:39|Today, the Sifang Pavilion was particularly quiet, and [Di Renjie] secretly tightened his nerves.
1:32:39|1:32:50|Outside the residence, [Di Renjie] cautiously opened the door a crack, revealing an empty room with only a figure in a black robe, chained and hanging on the terrace.
1:32:50|1:32:58|Ropes were set up on the door, connected to the door frame. When the door was opened to a certain width, the ropes suddenly pulled and yanked the wooden door.
1:33:4|1:33:15|It is [Pei Donglai]. Seeing him trapped on a wooden stake, facing the sun, [Di Renjie] immediately wielded his Konglongjian and rushed up. [Pei Donglai], who already disliked sunlight, now felt even more tormented by the exposure to the sun on the terrace. He began to speak.
1:33:21|1:33:31|Just as [Di Renjie] was about to dictate the clues, flames suddenly appeared on [Pei Donglai]'s body, and smoke billowed from his seven orifices, making it difficult to speak.
1:33:32|1:33:40|[Di Renjie] unlocked the chains on his body and dragged him into the house, but it was too late. Afterwards, flames ignited on [Pei Donglai]'s body, causing unbearable pain.
1:33:40|1:33:48|[Di Renjie] once again stepped forward to drag, but the raging flames had already engulfed his entire body. Despite his efforts, all he could manage to pull off was a step of the stairs.
1:33:48|1:33:55|When [Pei Donglai] was about to step forward for redemption, sparks were flying all around him, burning intensely, making it difficult for him to stand up.
1:33:55|1:34:2|[Di Renjie] could only watch as he contorted in agony, burning until there was nothing left. Yet even as he endured the pain of the demon fire consuming his body,
1:34:2|1:34:17|[Pei Donglai] did not shout wildly like an ordinary person. He just clenched his right fist, hoarsely muttered something, until he turned into a flying ash. [Di Renjie] was stunned. He never expected the killer to use such means to make him watch his companion die.
1:34:17|1:34:28|[Pei Donglai] does not like the heat, he always wanders in the darkness, but his actions are upright and pure, just like the solemn snow on his hair, reflecting the brightness in his heart.
1:34:28|1:34:38|It is the towering pine trees, with their rugged and majestic appearance, that were once considered the backbone of the building. Unfortunately, they have now been destroyed by traitors, which is truly regrettable.
1:34:38|1:34:56|[Di Renjie] knelt before the ashes of his colleague in mourning, but suddenly remembered the words [Pei Donglai] muttered before his death. He opened his eyes and used his long staff to flip over the charred body parts on the ground. Among them, he found a horse bridle buckle that made a slight noise, realizing that [Pei Donglai] had important information to convey to him.
1:34:56|1:35:3|He then picked up the horse rein buckle that had fallen off, carefully examined it, but found no hidden information.
1:35:3|1:35:27|The scene cuts to [Di Renjie] walking into the courtyard, approaching the horse ridden by [Pei Donglai]. He grasps the reins in his hand and compares it with the horse, noticing a leather strap locking it to the reins. With only two out of the three reins buckles remaining, he realizes the secret lies here. He reaches under the horse but finds nothing, then searches under the saddle and indeed discovers a stack of yellow papers.
1:35:27|1:35:36|It was the crucial clue that [Pei Donglai] had hidden in his arms back then. After being captured, it took him a great deal of effort to conceal the clue here.
1:35:36|1:35:51|[Di Renjie] couldn't wait to untie the yellow paper and upon examining it closely, his expression immediately changed. It seemed that all the difficult points of the case were clarified from the clues on the paper, showing regret and resentment on his face, as if the identity of the murderer was about to be revealed.
1:35:51|1:36:17|The scene shifts to inside the imperial palace, where the Empress Dowager [Wu Zetian] has suppressed the grief of [Shangguan Jing'er]'s passing. After grooming herself, she drapes her body in fine silk and stands outside the hall, gazing at the towering pagoda that reaches sixty-six zhang high, exuding an imposing aura as if overlooking the world and possessing the heroic spirit to pluck stars and seize the moon.
1:36:18|1:36:24|She seemed to be proclaiming to the world with such a look that women can also ascend to the throne and be honored as the supreme ruler.
1:36:25|1:36:34|Turning around and walking into the palace, Di Renjie saw several eunuchs standing or crouching, holding up the court robes to be worn by the Empress Wu Zetian on the next day of her coronation.
1:36:34|1:36:58|Upon the luxurious attire, the symbol of status, the nine-clawed golden dragon, was no longer visible. In its place was a soaring divine phoenix. The Empress was immersed in the joy of Datong, unaware that within the towering pagoda above, a cold gaze had been watching her for a long time. Unexpectedly, this person turned out to be the overseer of the Great Buddha, [Di Renjie]'s old friend, Sha Tuo.
1:36:58|1:37:10|At this moment, he stood within the gaze of the Buddha's eyes, carrying the blueprints and scrolls of the overseer on his back, looking down from above. The timidity in the face of weakness that had long disappeared was replaced by a chilling coldness that penetrated to the bone.
1:37:10|1:37:18|Seeing [Wu Zetian] entering the hall, [Di Renjie] turned around and walked to the edge of the pavilion, throwing down the scroll on his back.
1:37:18|1:37:24|At the same time, a group of people from the lower level of the Futo walked in aggressively, led by the Kunlun slave who captured [Pei Donglai].
1:37:26|1:37:43|With a command from [Di Renjie], these people rushed to various hidden places inside the giant Buddha, acting swiftly and methodically, looking as if they had been trained for a long time. They pushed the giant gears to open the furnace under the central pillar, filled it with wood, and soon a roaring fire was lit.
1:37:43|1:38:7|And just when everything seemed to be going smoothly, a strong wind rose. Di Renjie suddenly heard the sound of paper fluttering beside him. Looking up, he saw a piece of paper posted on the wooden box in front of him. Di Renjie, who understood everything, appeared slowly and said,
1:38:16|1:38:26|However, unable to escape the fate of being killed, [Di Renjie] neither argued nor interrupted the [Tujue] reasoning, but simply stared at him, rolling up his sleeve to reveal the bronze hook on his severed hand.
1:38:37|1:38:52|[Di Renjie] saw [Shatuo] swing his arm, hitting directly on the miniature pagoda model. The scaled-down Buddha, under his forceful blow, crashed straight towards the hall of the sand table. Seeing the hall collapse in an instant, [Di Renjie] tensed up and said.
1:39:22|1:39:30|[Shatuo] lifted the pedestal, and the two people standing in the wooden box slowly descended to the lower level.
1:40:4|1:40:14|[Shatuo] closed his eyes, seemingly recalling his various strategies through the words of [Di Renjie].
1:40:26|1:40:33|Di Renjie heard what he said and knew that this person had already gone astray.
1:40:33|1:40:40|[Shatuo] revealed his severed hand and calmly said,
1:40:40|1:40:46|He reached out and punctured the top deck of the wooden box, immediately pulling himself out into the air and climbing up the hemp rope on the side.
1:40:46|1:40:53|In the wooden box, [Di Renjie] looked up and saw the crack, from which countless red flame golden turtles poured down.
1:40:53|1:41:1|[Di Renjie] quickly rolled to dodge, leaping out of the wooden box and hanging in mid-air. [Shatuo] kicked fiercely on the hemp rope, pressing [Di Renjie] with his arms spread open.
1:41:1|1:41:22|In desperation, [Di Renjie] had to move around and eventually clung to the copper ring with both hands, only to see the spring tainted with the red flame golden turtle flowing out from the gap in the wooden board above his head. At the bottom of the box, numerous poisonous insects were crawling, occasionally falling down from beside [Di Renjie], creating a series of dangerous situations.
1:41:22|1:41:42|[Shatuo] was constrained by the length of the hemp rope and could no longer act against [Di Renjie] under the wooden box. He flew away, while on the other side, countless red-flamed golden turtles had already fallen on [Di Renjie], who was hanging under the box. It was only with the faint moonlight that he noticed the golden turtles were draped in red clouds, with a hundred pairs of antennae that were truly terrifying.
1:41:42|1:41:59|After slapping to death the poisonous insect falling on his face, [Di Renjie] quickly dodged the poisonous arrows shot by the underlings of the Sand Tribe at the lower level of the giant Buddha. As the Sand Tribe member landed on the ground along the hemp rope, he quickly drew the long sword from his waist and hurried to the control room of the elevator for the wooden box.
1:41:59|1:42:7|[Shatuo] decisively swung his sword, cutting the rope connecting the wooden box, causing [Di Renjie] suspended in mid-air to be instantly pushed by the box, rapidly descending towards the ground.
1:42:7|1:42:16|At the critical moment, [Di Renjie] exerted all his strength to cling to the side of the wooden box and seized the opportunity to rush towards the floating bridge connected to the central pillar beside him.
1:42:23|1:42:31|At this moment, a loud noise was heard as the wooden box fell from a great height and crashed to the ground, indicating the towering height of the place where it had just fallen.
1:42:31|1:42:42|If [Di Renjie] had not taken the risk to leap out, solely relying on the human body, it would definitely not withstand such impact. Just as [Di Renjie] landed safely, two sections of pipes slowly descended, directly entering the core pillar inside.
1:42:48|1:42:58|[Di Renjie] silently thought in his heart, then looked around to observe the movements of the people, and realized that the Tujue tribe intended to use the high temperature of the lava to melt the central pillar, causing the collapse of the giant Buddha. Just as he was about to find a way to stop it,
1:42:58|1:43:15|Di Renjie saw the Kunlun slave let out a long roar and approach him. With the coronation ceremony at stake, Di Renjie did not want to engage with him and face the enemy. Instead, he quickly moved towards the pipeline and fought against the enemy who was pouring in the magma. Seeing this, the Sand Troopers were afraid that their plan would be delayed, so they hurriedly flew up to obstruct him.
1:43:15|1:43:21|At that time, the two sides were entangled, reluctant to part ways. [Di Renjie], known as the Detective Dee, was skilled in martial arts and not inferior to anyone.
1:43:21|1:43:34|Given the Dragon Spur bestowed by the late emperor, Di Renjie displayed his prowess in battle. With everyone holding their ground, he placed the spur on the pipe, showcasing a formidable stance that seemed like one man guarding the pass against ten thousand.
1:43:55|1:44:14|Sand Tuo, harboring deep hatred, had already lost his mind. Despite Di Renjie's dissuasion, he could not control himself. He roared and wielded his sword to counter Kang Longjian, forcing Di Renjie to retreat. Sand Tuo then ordered his men to release molten lava, while he himself, along with his Kunlun slaves, blocked the way. Now everything was set, as the molten lava poured into the central pillar and burned it down.
1:44:54|1:45:19|Kunlun slave heard this, charged forward, heading straight for [Di Renjie]. In the prosperous era of the Great Tang Dynasty, with envoys from all nations, the barbarian tribes and countless subjects, the so-called Kunlun slave was a barbarian captured from beyond the South Sea. These people were as strong as bulls, loyal to the core, and were slaves in wealthy households. However, even with his unparalleled martial prowess, [Di Renjie] easily defeated him, relying on the sharpness of the Kangling staff to shatter the Kunlun slave's cheekbones.
1:45:19|1:45:33|Fingers intertwined, the pain of bone splitting, one can imagine, as another general under the Sand Tribe is lost, just when all seems helpless, the rising sun shines through the dome of the Great Buddha. Unbeknownst to all, this battle has raged on throughout the night.
1:45:33|1:45:43|The Tujue tribe is in a state of extreme anxiety, as the moment of the Empress's ascension to the throne is fast approaching, yet they still cannot deal with Di Renjie. After a moment of contemplation, a new plan forms in their minds.
1:45:43|1:45:47|Pushing open the windows of the grand pagoda, sunlight streamed in.
1:45:47|1:46:9|[Di Renjie] saw him in such a state, hurriedly checked for wounds all over his body, and indeed found traces of bites from poisonous insects on his arm. At this critical moment, [Di Renjie] didn't even spare a thought for mercy, wielding the Konglong Mace skillfully to exploit the enemy's weaknesses, every move deadly. In an instant, the followers of the Sand Tribe were dying in droves. Amidst the chaos and turmoil, he passed by a window without even realizing it.
1:46:9|1:46:21|[Di Renjie] suddenly felt dizzy, the heat unbearable. Looking ahead, he saw that the bite marks from the venomous insect had turned black. [Di Renjie] couldn't believe it, and once again reached out his hand towards the rising sun.
1:46:27|1:46:34|At the same time, the enthronement ceremony in the Imperial Palace's Hall of Supreme Harmony has begun.
1:47:3|1:47:27|Di Renjie paid no attention to the shouting of the Shatuo, but stood on the pavilion carefully examining the two channels flowing with molten lava. He saw the molten lava flowing into the central pillar from the southwest and southeast directions, controlling its direction of fracture. After confirming the direction and formulating a feasible plan, he turned the Dragon Spine Mace, cutting off one of the iron chains. Then he shouted at the Shatuo.
1:47:30|1:47:40|With a final strike, the floating bridge collapsed and fell, crashing into a pipe on the side, scattering molten iron scraps all over the ground, causing sparks to fly in all directions.
1:47:41|1:47:49|The Tujue people saw [Di Renjie] in this act, their faces filled with resentment, wishing to tear him apart, without caring about their former camaraderie.
1:47:50|1:47:56|[Di Renjie] stood on the pavilion after moving away from the molten lava pit,
1:48:6|1:48:18|The anger burned in his heart, the veins on his face bulged, roaring to vent, then he stabbed the water tank, took out the poisonous insect, poured it into the golden pot, sealed the mouth of the pot, and said.
1:48:19|1:48:46|He leaped onto a horse and continued to shout, then turned the horse's head and rode out of the Tongtian Pagoda. [Di Renjie] immediately mounted a steed and chased after him, as the sand bandits on horseback approached, shouting and pushing open the bronze gate.
1:48:49|1:49:5|The central pillar, eroded by lava for a long time, finally couldn't bear the weight and cracked in numerous places, causing the entire giant Buddha to shake violently. [Di Renjie] rode out of the tower, only to suddenly remember the golden turtle poison in his body, looking up to see a dark cloud overhead.
1:49:5|1:49:12|Feeling slightly relieved, [Di Renjie] immediately spurred his horse towards Shatuo to give chase. The two met on the battlefield in the city, one in front and one behind.
1:49:15|1:49:45|[Di Renjie] was paying attention to the situation while chasing after Shatuo. Still remembering the past, he shouted loudly. Shatuo's heart had been consumed by vengeance for nearly a decade, his soul burned to ashes. Now filled with anger, he fought fiercely on horseback with Di Renjie. Shatuo, consumed by the desire for revenge, feared that the conflict with [Di Renjie] would delay his plans, so he pushed with all his might to force him back, and then did not pursue further.
1:49:45|1:50:4|Turning around and sitting on the horse, Di Renjie continued to gallop towards the Hall of Light. At the same time, the molten lava exploded at the foundation, causing the central pillar to collapse, slowly falling down. The floating bridge inside the pagoda broke like a thread and fell to the ground, while the outer robe of the pagoda cracked inch by inch. The giant Buddha tilted, approaching the Hall of Light directly.
1:50:4|1:50:17|In the palace and the government office, the guards looked as confused and lost as described by the Sha Tuo. On the other side, Sha Tuo paid no attention and continued to rush towards the Hall of Light at full speed. Wherever he passed, the sun shone brightly, leaving [Di Renjie] behind in a panic.
1:50:17|1:50:38|Despite the danger, [Di Renjie] was unwilling to give up the pursuit and had to hide under the horse's belly to avoid the sunlight. The guards in the Ming Hall hurriedly reported the situation, causing panic among the officials, eunuchs, and palace maids.
1:50:38|1:50:46|Only the newly crowned Empress [Wu Zetian] slowly stood up, her face unchanged, as the towering pagoda collapsed, causing the entire palace to shake.
1:50:46|1:51:0|[Wu Zetian]'s crown was adorned with hanging pearl curtains that kept clashing and swaying incessantly. Looking at the majestic Buddha statue, cracks had already appeared, with the lotus flowers at its feet withered and almost gone, losing its former grandeur and magnificence, causing chaos in the hearts of the people in the capital.
1:51:0|1:51:7|On the other side, [Di Renjie], who was hiding under the horse's belly, finally waited for the moment when the sun was covered by clouds, then he climbed onto the horse of the Tujue.
1:51:7|1:51:16|Just as he was about to reach the steps, [Di Renjie] launched a surprise attack from behind on horseback, grabbing him by the chest and pulling him forcefully towards himself.
1:51:17|1:51:43|Reaching out to open the pot carried by the Sand Tribe, a swarm of poisonous insects poured out. [Di Renjie], who was already poisoned by the Golden Turtle, had no fear. Amidst the chaos, the Sand Tribe was kicked out of the horse herd by [Di Renjie] at the right moment. Just as he was preparing to fight to the death, he lowered his head and saw thick black smoke emanating from his body. He quickly tore open his chest and found several Crimson Flame Golden Turtles clinging to him. Under the sunlight, a haze of smoke filled the air.
1:51:43|1:51:47|In just a moment, a blazing fire ignited on [Di Renjie].
1:51:54|1:52:3|Before his death, [Di Renjie] looked at the Mingtang, spitting out blood and roaring, through the eerie flames, it seemed that one could still see his crazed eyes.
1:52:11|1:52:18|Upon seeing the grand statue of herself as the emperor collapse on the day of her coronation, what thoughts ran through [Wu Zetian]'s mind?
1:52:24|1:52:44|Seeing the giant Buddha leaning towards the Hall of Light, the guards hurriedly supported [Wu Zetian] to dodge to the side. As the Buddha arrived, smoke filled the air and poured down, causing the entire Eastern Capital to tremble. When the Buddha landed, its head was knocked off and fell apart, revealing a huge Buddha face in the sky that enveloped the entire Hall of Light.
1:52:50|1:52:57|The guards protecting [Wu Zetian] were already extremely tense. Upon hearing the sound and seeing the smoke filling the air without seeing anyone, they drew their swords in response.
1:52:57|1:53:12|[Di Renjie] at this moment couldn't spare the time to explain, and had to draw out the Konglong Staff to force the attendant back to the side, taking [Wu Zetian] to dodge the Buddha's face in the sky. This move was truly a last resort, after all, [Di Renjie] still had the poison of the Golden Turtle inside him. If spontaneous combustion occurred near [Wu Zetian], wouldn't it be a wasted effort.
1:53:12|1:53:20|Fortunately, at this moment, the dust was flying, obscuring the sun, and the Buddha's face was covering the arrogance in the sky, so [Di Renjie] was temporarily safe.
1:53:20|1:53:26|At this moment, the giant Buddha has completely collapsed, and the imperial city is shrouded in smoke, no longer exuding the grandeur of the royal family.
1:53:26|1:53:32|Before the Hall of Light, the courtiers and guards withdrew from the wasteland and shouted.
1:53:37|1:53:46|[Di Renjie] guarded [Wu Zetian] with his own body, at this moment he was already in a daze. Beneath him was [Wu Zetian].
1:53:46|1:53:50|Lying weak on the nearby broken stones.
1:53:53|1:54:0|The emperor's guards swept in, only to find [Wu Zetian] unharmed.
1:54:34|1:54:39|Di Renjie saw Wu Zetian deploying troops in the ruins with composure. He nodded slightly and chuckled, saying a few words.
1:55:10|1:55:18|Empress Wu, in anger, stood up and threw off her phoenix robe, commanding the countless courtiers to retreat like a tide.
1:55:25|1:55:31|[Wu Zetian] knelt before the Konglong Scepter as summoned.
1:55:50|1:55:58|In tears, [Wu Zetian] spoke with eyes welling up like springs, saying,
1:56:7|1:56:18|[Di Renjie] held up the Konglong Rod with both hands, knelt down in front of the Empress, quickly helped her up, and the Empress spoke,
1:56:27|1:56:35|[Di Renjie] smiled and then continued speaking,
1:56:41|1:56:55|He placed the Dragon Spine Staff in the Empress's hand and then left. The Empress watched his departing figure, feeling a complex mix of emotions in her heart. However, she refrained from revealing her feelings in front of the court officials and decided to let it go.
1:56:55|1:57:15|Gazing into the distance as [Di Renjie] departs, the scene shifts to a dark valley. Standing on a bridge by the shore, a figure with folded arms gazes into the distance where the river ends. Surrounding cliffs are dotted with ruins and countless scattered braziers, marking the ancient capital of Luoyang buried deep underground.
1:57:15|1:57:22|In the boundless ghost market, the identity of the person on the shore is still unknown. Another person steps forward and speaks slowly, revealing the truth of the case.
