0:4:59|0:5:17|[Yi Yao] stubbornly picked up the tissue, used it and then threw it fiercely into the trash can. On the other side, the mother was busy massaging and wiping the massage chair, while [Yi Yao] quickly walked over, using a plastic bag to pack up two steamed buns.
0:5:25|0:5:38|The mother threw the chopsticks on the table, which happened to hit Qi Ming's bicycle at the door. Qi Ming's mother next to him was unhappy, and Qi Ming looked at Yi Yao.
0:5:49|0:6:2|Qi Ming turned around and saw Yi Yao squatting on the ground picking up chopsticks, while Qi Ming's mother gave a disdainful glance at Yi Yao's mother before leaving. Yi Yao's mother, unwilling to show weakness, slammed the door shut as Yi Yao pushed her bike around the alleyway.
0:6:2|0:6:7|She found [Qi Ming] waiting for her in the car. Seeing [Yi Yao] approaching,
0:6:7|0:6:15|[Qi Ming] took out a bottle of milk from his bag and said
0:6:24|0:6:30|In the alley, the childhood sweethearts were not as difficult to deal with as the elders. Soon, two cars came one after the other.
0:6:30|0:6:37|Pulled out of the alley. [Yi Yao] suddenly caught sight of a girl being bullied on the sidewalk across the street.
0:6:44|0:7:6|The girl named [Tang Xiaomi] could only bow her head and let others manipulate her. [Yi Yao] and [Qi Ming] have arrived at the school gate. In the crowd, everyone took off their coats, revealing the new school uniforms and walking into the campus. Among them, [Yi Yao] in the old-style uniform stood out conspicuously.
0:7:6|0:7:15|[Yi Yao] came to the bathroom, leaning against the door panel, looking at the mirror with a vacant expression. She gently turned on the faucet, and her haggard face was reflected in the sink.
0:7:15|0:7:32|She recalled the information she found in the library, that day [Yi Yao] opened the search page with full of questions, but she didn't expect her own brows to furrow tighter and tighter, the webpage listed many reasons for girls' lower body pain, [Yi Yao] felt nervous.
0:7:32|0:7:40|She unconsciously clenched her hands and continued searching. The popped-up webpage was filled with various unsettling words and images.
0:7:40|0:7:47|Keywords such as genital herpes, sexually transmitted diseases, sexual activities, and so on. Each keyword is like a heavy blow.
0:7:47|0:8:4|The blow struck hard at the heart of this young girl, how can a student who is still inexperienced in the ways of the world bear such unspeakable pain. With a frown, she stared intently at the screen, constantly seeing those words that struck her soul deeply, as well as those indescribable images.
0:8:37|0:9:0|In the corridor, the girls were smiling and posing in various ways. The center of attention, [Tang Xiaomi], looked particularly dazzling. After taking a photo, [Yi Yao] was pushed aside by boys as she prepared to enter the classroom, looking displeased. On the blackboard, in large letters, it said, "Welcome new student [Tang Xiaomi]."
0:9:9|0:9:14|[Yi Yao] recalled the girl across the street this morning who had milk tea poured on her head. [Yi Yao] didn't want to dwell on it.
0:9:14|0:9:29|Turning around to start erasing the blackboard, [Yi Yao] shook his head. In no time, he finished erasing the blackboard and walked down from the platform. [Tang Xiaomi] stared at [Yi Yao]'s back, pondering something.
0:9:29|0:9:50|[Yi Yao] had just returned to her seat when [Qi Ming] walked over to show concern. Sitting across from [Yi Yao], [Qi Ming] eagerly asked, while [Tang Xiaomi] opened a book and secretly glanced towards [Qi Ming]. A few girls nearby exchanged glances and gathered around [Tang Xiaomi], creating a lively scene.
0:10:17|0:10:27|[Qi Ming] knew [Yi Yao]'s stubborn nature and didn't ask further. Fortunately, he got up and left, but not before patting [Yi Yao]'s head. This scene was noticed by [Tang Xiaomi] who was standing nearby.
0:10:27|0:10:49|In the auditorium, as the spotlights turned on, the banner on the curtain read "2007 Peace High School Outstanding Student Commendation Ceremony." Students hurried towards the auditorium, but in the crowd, a figure in an old-fashioned school uniform walked in the opposite direction, lonely. A female student with a crutch hobbled from the audience seats towards the stage, casting a graceful shadow.
0:10:49|0:11:0|Especially eye-catching, the girl named [Gu Senxiang] gave up her front seat and helped the girl with crutches to sit down.
0:11:0|0:11:6|She took a few steps back and sat down in an empty seat. In the front row, [Qi Ming] was giving a familiar acceptance speech.
0:11:10|0:11:16|[Tang Xiaomi] looked admiringly at [Qi Ming], while [Qi Ming] sent a text message to [Yi Yao] inquiring about the hospital matters.
0:11:16|0:11:27|The girl with a limp picked up the phone, [Gu Senxiang] leaned forward half of her body, wanting to reach for the phone across the seat, her beautiful hair inadvertently draping over [Qi Ming]'s shoulder.
0:11:27|0:11:37|[Qi Ming] caught a whiff of fragrance and couldn't help but look at her delicate features. The outstanding [Gu Senxiang] easily became the center of attention in the crowd, but she couldn't reach her phone with her outstretched hand. [Qi Ming] clapped his hands and said,
0:11:45|0:11:52|A casual remark brought a smile to the lips of two people. [Qi Ming] continued to look at the script, but the joy in his eyes could not be concealed.
0:11:52|0:12:18|[Gu Senxiang] was openly smiling, the award-winning students lined up, the teacher presented bouquets to the students, [Qi Ming] took the bouquet and bowed, but as he stood up, the bouquet bumped into [Gu Senxiang]. She sneezed and stepped back, waving her hands to return to her position. Subconsciously, she used the certificate of honor to cover her mouth and nose. [Qi Ming] felt a bit embarrassed and said:
0:12:20|0:12:47|[Gu Senxiang] just used the certificate to cover her face without speaking, while on the hospital bed, [Yi Yao] stared with anxious eyes, looking fearfully at the overhead surgical light. Normally strong, she was now gripping the bed rails tightly, feeling extremely nervous. As the doctor reached deep into [Yi Yao]'s legs with a tool, she tried hard to calm herself down as she listened to the doctor's words. However, tears uncontrollably slid down her cheeks, unexpectedly.
0:12:47|0:12:56|[Qi Ming] was waiting in the hospital consultation room at this time. Sitting next to him, [Gu Senxiang] had red cheeks covered with small pimples. She nodded obediently, listening to the doctor's words.
0:13:13|0:13:40|The doctor in the examination room took off his gloves and walked back to the office to start writing medical records. Yi Yao, who had put on his clothes, got off the bed. Hearing this, Yi Yao walked over in shock with wide eyes. The doctor looked at Yi Yao in school uniform, glanced at the medical records, and continued.
0:13:40|0:13:48|[Yi Yao] shook her head in frustration with a furrowed brow.
0:14:21|0:14:45|[Yi Yao]'s brows furrowed tighter and tighter, her eyes red from crying and filled with tears. The expensive medical bills, the tense mother-daughter relationship, the unspoken pain, all weighed heavily on her heart. Tears blurred her vision as she stumbled towards the elevator, everything happening so suddenly. Coming from a poor family, she didn't know how to bear it. Passing patients and nurses couldn't help but glance at this distressed girl. As soon as the elevator doors opened, [Yi Yao] rushed inside.
0:14:45|0:15:1|She was huddled in the corner of the elevator, crying with her head down. [Gu Senxi], who was on his way to visit his sister, felt a bit at a loss. He glanced inadvertently and realized that she was a fellow student at the same school. He timidly stepped forward and greeted her.
0:15:8|0:15:18|The elevator door opened, and a family of three walked in. [Gu Senxi] nervously said, then quickly walked out of the elevator, afraid of being misunderstood.
0:15:35|0:15:54|Not finished yet, [Yi Yao] has already entered the elevator, while on the other side [Qi Ming] apologizes. [Gu Senxiang] smiles and responds to [Qi Ming], lowering her head and looking helplessly at the bouquet in her hand, she sighs softly. The two walk side by side in the hospital lobby, [Qi Ming] reaches out to adjust the straps of [Gu Senxiang]'s backpack.
0:15:55|0:16:1|[Gu Senxi] looked around and saw her sister,
0:17:8|0:17:33|[Qi Ming] looked at the fading figures of the two siblings and smiled, feeling relieved. Inside the alley house, [Yi Yao] held a tube of ointment and stared at the packaging for a while before putting it down. She raised her hand to flip through the thin medical records on the table. In the other room, their mother was sitting at the table sewing clothes, with the dim light shining on their faces. Each of them had their own concerns. [Yi Yao] crumpled the medical records in her hand.
0:17:35|0:17:40|The mother's strictness did not allow her to resist, but [Yi Yao] brought the hatpin and refused to leave?
0:18:5|0:18:15|The harsh words made [Yi Yao] angrily leave. She returned to the inner room and just sat down when her mother continued.
0:18:23|0:18:51|[Yi Yao] closed his eyes in pain, while [Qi Ming] rode his bicycle with a bouquet of flowers in the front basket, slowly moving along the small path in the alley. Perhaps reminded of something, the young man couldn't help but smile slightly, with his lips curling up and even his eyes narrowing. Meanwhile, [Yi Yao] was struggling, unable to smile due to the heavy burden on his mind during dinner. In the end, he could only furrow his brow helplessly.
0:18:51|0:18:52|Continue cooking.
0:18:52|0:19:7|In front of the small window is the busy figure of [Yi Yao]. As [Qi Ming] passed by, he stopped his bicycle and looked inside. Two bell rings sounded like a secret code, and [Yi Yao] quickly arrived at the window. [Qi Ming] greeted through the window:
0:19:58|0:20:6|[Qi Ming]'s mother walked out of the house at some point, and soon [Qi Ming] pushed the cart back. As the mother and son approached each other, the mother asked:
0:20:11|0:20:15|[Qi Ming] obediently followed his mother into the house, while [Yi Yao] watched as [Qi Ming] left.
0:20:15|0:20:24|Bowing her head, she leaned in to smell the flowers in her arms, the first bouquet she had ever received in her life. Beautiful flowers against the backdrop of dilapidated walls.
0:20:24|0:20:41|The old window looked out of place, while [Yi Yao] held the bouquet tightly in her arms, sniffing it as if afraid it would wither tomorrow. The cool night breeze carried the scent of flowers past the window, through the alley, and over the girl's heart.
0:21:20|0:21:26|[Gu Senxi] looked at the back of [Yi Yao] and smirked, but was caught by the teacher.
0:21:31|0:21:42|[Gu Senxi] answered the teacher in a snatching manner, saying the same thing. The teacher was stunned, but [Gu Senxi] didn't care. As soon as the teacher left, he looked out the window and a smile appeared on his face again.
0:22:8|0:22:16|The bell rang, and the students all got up to move around. [Yi Yao] wearily rested his head on the desk, while the boy in front turned around excitedly and said something to [Yi Yao].
0:22:16|0:22:20|Tang Xiaomi was sitting in her seat, glaring angrily at Yi Yao's back.
0:22:31|0:22:37|[Tang Xiaomi] walked over joyfully.
0:23:5|0:23:16|[Qi Ming] asked somewhat shyly, and [Tang Xiaomi] took the homework book from the squad leader's arms, turned around and made an OK gesture towards the girls.
0:23:18|0:23:26|In the bustling alley at dusk, [Qi Ming] comes down from the loft bed, tidies up his clothes, and greets his family.
0:23:34|0:23:49|At the same time, [Yi Yao] was watering the flowers by the window. Yes, she put the bouquet into the vase. [Qi Ming] passed by, and [Yi Yao] looked at [Qi Ming] with an unpleasant expression on her face. Suddenly, she closed her eyes tightly and fell down.
0:24:3|0:24:10|He hurriedly flipped over [Yi Yao]'s body, without much thought, immediately picked up [Yi Yao] and ran towards the outside of the house, on the dark alleyway late at night.
0:24:47|0:24:54|In the childhood amusement park, [Yi Yao] was celebrating her birthday at a small table with her family of three, creating a particularly warm atmosphere. Unfortunately,
0:24:54|0:24:58|All memories have turned into bubbles, never to return.
0:24:58|0:25:4|Pale [Yi Yao] slowly opens her eyes on the hospital bed, looking around at the unfamiliar surroundings.
0:25:4|0:25:12|Completely forgetting why she was here, [Qi Ming] found herself in a hospital ward where a nurse was taking care of the patient in the next bed.
0:25:12|0:25:20|Looking around, a familiar face appeared in front of me, it was [Qi Ming], who was patiently guarding by the bedside at the moment.
0:25:20|0:25:29|Yi Yao was already half asleep, propping up his arm. Qi Ming immediately woke up when Yi Yao turned over gently.
0:25:39|0:25:48|[Yi Yao] couldn't say whether it was good or bad in her heart. The thing she was most worried about was still kept secret.
0:26:59|0:27:15|After saying that, [Qi Ming] got up to pour water, [Yi Yao]'s monologue, [Qi Ming] didn't care at all, while the girls in the KTV were playing a game.
0:27:16|0:27:23|[Tang Xiaomi] held a fruit plate, afraid of being snatched away by others. In the hospital room, [Qi Ming],
0:27:23|0:27:32|Qi Ming was giving water to [Yi Yao], supporting him as he slowly lay down and gently stroked [Yi Yao]'s hair. After being awake for a while, [Yi Yao]'s face finally no longer looked so pale.
0:27:36|0:27:49|[Qi Ming] took out his phone from the pocket of his coat and walked out of the ward, while [Yi Yao] tucked in the blanket and slowly closed her eyes. KTV's [Tang Xiaomi] was already a bit disappointed, playing with the entertainment toys absentmindedly, with a look of resentment on her face.
0:27:49|0:27:57|Just then, [Qi Ming] suddenly called, dispelling [Tang Xiaomi]'s displeasure. When the call was answered, he greeted sweetly.
0:27:59|0:28:5|Like a spoiled child, [Tang Xiaomi] showed off as she arrived at the door,
0:28:12|0:28:22|Tang Xiaomi walked to the mirror, checking her outfit beautifully, obviously surprised by the situation.
0:28:39|0:28:59|[Tang Xiaomi] hung up the phone, feeling a sense of disappointment in her heart. All her expectations were dashed, and her boasting had become a joke. She easily pinned all her dissatisfaction on [Yi Yao], and as she thought about it, a fierce look appeared in her eyes. Determined in her heart, she decided that she must teach [Yi Yao] a lesson.
0:28:59|0:29:6|While [Yi Yao] just woke up in the hospital. [Qi Ming] gently stroked the back of [Yi Yao]'s hand where the needle had been. [Yi Yao], still heavy-hearted, said
0:29:7|0:29:17|Tears rolled down the corner of her eyes. [Qi Ming] smiled faintly.
0:29:18|0:29:36|[Yi Yao] turned away, hiding her tears from [Qi Ming], but the sorrow was real. Tears kept streaming down [Yi Yao]'s nose, falling onto the pillow, while memories flooded her mind.
0:29:40|0:29:43|In the dream, the amusement park emerges. A family of three is enjoying their holiday on the pirate ship.
0:29:43|0:29:58|Grown-up [Yi Yao] stood not far away, gazing tightly at the ordinary family of three, the tight days were the most beautiful dream in this girl's heart, so much so that even after becoming a memory, it was her safe haven.
0:29:58|0:30:2|Unfortunately, time waits for no one, the past will not come back.
0:30:2|0:30:27|The deserted amusement park is now covered with fallen leaves, just like the turmoil in [Yi Yao]'s heart. She stands alone in the dilapidated playground, yearning for family warmth. Under the gloomy sky, she holds herself tightly, as if guarding the last stronghold of her heart. With a poor family background and urgent illness, she is in a state of panic.
0:30:27|0:30:47|Classmates' gazes tormented her once-blooming youth, with the greatest pain being the deep sense of powerlessness after seeing the truth, the unsolvable situation weighing heavily on the girl's heart. [Qi Ming] sat at the dining table, reading a book.
0:30:48|0:30:58|The father walked in, took off his coat, put down his keys and wallet, and headed straight into the house.
0:30:58|0:31:6|[Qi Ming] turned to look at the wallet on the table by the door, knowing that his father had just received his salary today. Surprisingly, [Qi Ming] had a crooked idea in mind.
0:31:17|0:31:27|The father took out his wallet and noticed that some money was missing. He looked at [Qi Ming] with suspicion, but ultimately didn't ask.
0:31:27|0:31:35|[Qi Ming] glanced nervously at his father. The next day in the classroom, [Yi Yao] opened his wallet on his seat, which only had some loose change in it.
0:31:35|0:31:42|She took out two cans of the only ointment from the drawer in frustration.
0:32:4|0:32:16|[Qi Ming] came to [Yi Yao] after finishing his homework, he gently removed the small thing on the tip of [Yi Yao]'s nose. [Yi Yao] felt puzzled, but this scene was clearly seen by [Tang Xiaomi] behind, with a sense of resentment.
0:32:16|0:32:25|Jealousy. Spreading on her beautiful face, [Yi Yao] and [Qi Ming] arrived at the garage.
0:32:58|0:33:10|[Yi Yao] threw the money on the ground, got on the car without looking back. [Qi Ming] squatted down helplessly, picking up the money one by one. [Gu Senxiang] walked over at some point, [Qi Ming] looked up and met her gaze, feeling a bit embarrassed as he said:
0:33:44|0:33:50|On a gloomy day just after the rain, [Yi Yao] rode her bicycle with a frown on her face on the road, while not far behind her
0:33:50|0:33:57|A girl in a short skirt and long socks followed behind the car, it was [Tang Xiaomi]. [Yi Yao] headed in the direction of...
0:33:57|0:34:22|Obviously not going home, [Tang Xiaomi] somehow caught up inexplicably. On that day, with red eyes, [Yi Yao] slowly parked the car by the roadside. Across the street was the hospital she had visited before. She looked at the hospital solemnly, but in her heart, she was having second thoughts. After a moment of contemplation, she ultimately decided that her wallet was empty and she had no confidence, so she turned the bike in another direction. She ran to the hospital, but didn't enter and left again, leaving the trailing [Tang Xiaomi] puzzled.
0:34:22|0:34:29|Just as [Tang Xiaomi] caught up by riding her bike again, she saw the classmate who used to bully her before transferring schools.
0:34:39|0:34:45|The dim yellow light reflected off the mottled walls of the alley. [Yi Yao] pushed a cart to the entrance of a run-down clinic.
0:34:45|0:35:1|Facing financial difficulties, [Yi Yao] had no choice but to try her luck in a place like this. Encouraging herself, she gritted her teeth and decided to give it a shot. Parking the car neatly, she swiftly took off her school uniform, turned it inside out, and slung her backpack over her shoulder as she walked inside.
0:35:1|0:35:16|Upon entering, the eyes are greeted by an old corridor, where a middle-aged woman sits busily at a sewing machine. The walls on both sides of the corridor are covered with various strange and peculiar small advertisements. [Yi Yao] hesitates as she takes a step upstairs.
0:35:16|0:35:25|On the second floor, there is a window. The glass is pasted with accommodation registration, it looks like an unknown small hotel. Turning around the corridor,
0:35:25|0:35:32|The elder sister at the hotel front desk was cracking melon seeds. The oppressive atmosphere made [Yi Yao] feel at a loss, causing her to unconsciously quicken her pace.
0:35:32|0:35:38|She was greeted by a long corridor, quiet to an unusual degree, with no semblance of a clinic.
0:35:38|0:35:45|[Yi Yao] was a little scared, clutching the straps of her backpack tightly with both hands, moving forward slowly. Not long after.
0:35:45|0:36:7|[Yi Yao] quietly approached a door, she looked up at the sign on the door that read "Consulting Room 1" to make sure she was in the right place. She then leaned forward and peeked through the crack in the door. Inside, the room was very messy, with mahjong tiles scattered all over the square table. Next to an old cabinet sat a middle-aged man, with his feet up on the table, reading a newspaper and drinking hot tea.
0:36:7|0:36:15|The other person looked up and saw [Yi Yao]. [Yi Yao] immediately rushed downstairs in a panic, as if she had just been through a fierce battle. In just a few short minutes,
0:36:15|0:36:22|Her heart was particularly tormented, and she crouched at the door panting in fear. [Yi Yao] was startled and immediately stood up.
0:36:22|0:36:47|The owner of the phone pressed the shutter button, it was [Tang Xiaomi] who had been chased for several blocks. She also looked at [Yi Yao] vigilantly with red eyes. [Tang Xiaomi] looked at the clinic advertisement on the wall, deliberately dragging out the long vowel sound. A curious look appeared on her smiling face, instantly pushing [Yi Yao] into an abyss. [Yi Yao] blushed, biting her lip.
0:36:47|0:36:56|Tears swirled in her eyes, and in her anger, her body couldn't help but tremble. Soon, tears slid down her cheeks, and not long after,
0:37:37|0:37:46|It's a terrifying school bullying. Walking in the school will be surrounded, clean school uniform splashed with ink, even when eating,
0:37:46|0:38:2|Some students also poured leftover food into [Yi Yao]'s bowl, and the news spread quickly like a virus. [Yi Yao] was labeled as a carrier of the pathogen, and baseless curses, accusations, disdain, and contempt followed one after another.
0:38:2|0:38:24|Even walking on the street, [Yi Yao] would still have paper stuck on her back by classmates. All she could do was run desperately, trying to escape from the crowd, from the gossip. Even if she managed to escape downstairs, a bucket of dirty water would still pour down from above, splashing all over her face. Kind-hearted classmates who wanted to help would be stopped by others.
0:38:24|0:38:29|At night by the river, the wind blows, but memories of school experiences keep coming to mind.
0:38:29|0:38:42|In front of the window at home, the flowers sent by [Qi Ming] have withered. By the river, [Yi Yao] is holding her head in pain, covering her ears with her hands, staring fearfully into the distance, as if those rumors always manage to sneak into her ears over the mountains.
0:38:42|0:38:59|In the small pond in the grassy beach that day floated an old school bag, covered with the scent of autumn, with withered weeds and leaves on top. The pond was filled with impurities, like a pool of dirty water. [Yi Yao] stood in the water,
0:38:59|0:39:7|The cold lake water rose above her chest. The old school bag gently swayed on the surface of the water, lonely in this pond.
0:39:7|0:39:34|Just like [Yi Yao]'s life, he was powerless. [Yi Yao] made up his mind to move forward slowly, being extremely cautious with every step. Stretching out his hand and gritting his teeth, [Yi Yao] took two slow steps forward. Just a little bit more and he could reach the backpack. Stretching his neck and extending his hand, he slipped and fell into the water. Suddenly, [Yi Yao] was lifted up from behind by [Gu Senxi], who had arrived.
0:39:34|0:39:41|Tightly holding [Yi Yao], [Qi Ming] dragged [Yi Yao] back to the shore.
0:41:7|0:41:14|[Gu Senxi] looked into the distance in contemplation, while [Yi Yao] waited for his response, then angrily walked away.
0:41:30|0:41:47|[Gu Senxi] looked up and saw that [Yi Yao] had already walked far away. So he shouted towards her back, but [Yi Yao] didn't respond. She always felt that this boy talked a lot of nonsense, but the next day, [Yi Yao] still came, and she arrived at this small grove.
0:41:57|0:42:9|[Gu Senxi] was talking, but his hand kept reaching towards [Yi Yao]'s shoulder. [Yi Yao] kept shaking his hand off time and time again. The two of them sat under the shade of a tree, nibbling on hot dogs.
0:43:1|0:43:9|[Gu Senxi] dunks on the low basketball hoop, then slaps the ball to scare [Yi Yao]. [Yi Yao] on the swing is startled.
0:43:34|0:43:41|[Gu Senxi] reached out his hands and clapped, indicating. [Yi Yao] lowered her head somewhat embarrassed.
0:43:41|0:43:52|[Gu Senxi] crouched down, and [Yi Yao] immediately stood up and said while running.
0:43:54|0:44:3|She came to the pool of ocean balls and plunged in headfirst. It was like falling into a colorful rainbow, with various ocean balls enveloping her, and the setting sun shining down.
0:44:3|0:44:24|On her profile, at this moment [Yi Yao] seemed to have found a bit of meaning in life. She slowly closed her eyes, enjoying a moment of quiet away from the crowd. She turned sideways in the ocean ball, slowly curling up her body, tightly hugging her knees and curling towards deeper waters. Layer by layer, the ocean ball was gently pushed open by a pair of gentle hands.
0:45:20|0:45:25|He wanted to get closer. Sitting by the pool, [Yi Yao] muttered to himself, trying to push away [Gu Senxi]. [Gu Senxi] gave him a displeased look.
0:45:25|0:45:56|But step by step, [Gu Senxi] squeezed through the ocean ball pile to [Yi Yao]'s side, sat down with a surprised look from [Yi Yao]. [Gu Senxi] smiled and said, [Yi Yao] was first surprised, then realized that she was a beautiful thing in his eyes. She shyly lowered her head, embarrassedly fiddling with the ocean balls in her hands. [Gu Senxi] also lowered his head, cautiously leaning towards [Yi Yao] with his shoulder, coughed lightly, scared away, full of admiration wanting to get close to [Gu Senxi].
0:46:7|0:46:37|In the classroom, the big-faced girl chewed the gum and stuck it on [Yi Yao]'s hair. After finishing, she happily ran back to her group, where they gestured and laughed as if they had accomplished something great. Hearing their cheerful voices, [Yi Yao] decisively picked up the scissors and cut off that strand of hair. She stood up and fiercely stuck the gum-covered strand of hair on the big-faced girl's bangs. [Yi Yao], who started to resist, dropped their jaws.
0:46:37|0:46:53|No one expected the usually submissive little lamb to suddenly become so fierce. [Yi Yao] was walking in the corridor when a basketball flew and hit the wall next to a boy's head, which scared him and made him angry.
0:46:54|0:47:3|[Yi Yao] turned around to see [Gu Senxi] picking up the basketball. They exchanged a glance, both trying to suppress a smile, before walking away.
0:47:3|0:47:10|In the physical education class, the whole class practiced paired volleyball. How could [Tang Xiaomi]'s small group miss this opportunity?
0:47:31|0:47:42|Qi Ming looked at Yi Yao in disbelief. Yi Yao stared back at her without any sign of weakness, leaving the small group stunned. Yi Yao then casually continued playing volleyball as if it were just a small matter.
0:47:42|0:47:54|At noon in the cafeteria, [Yi Yao] walked in with her head held high. A male student couldn't avoid her and bumped into another girl, spilling food all over himself. However, this commotion attracted more people's attention.
0:48:30|0:48:45|[Yi Yao] chased after the boy with a water pipe, even [Tang Xiaomi] and others couldn't dodge in time. [Qi Ming] walked over, took the water pipe from [Yi Yao], and faced [Qi Ming]'s questioning.
0:48:47|0:48:53|[Yi Yao] bit her lip in frustration, unsure of how to deal with [Qi Ming]. Fortunately, she picked up the water pipe to shut off the faucet.
0:48:53|0:49:7|The students watching the commotion followed, and in front of the faucet was [Gu Senxi]. [Qi Ming] strode forward and threw the water pipe into the pool.
0:49:15|0:49:23|[Gu Senxi] splashed the water from the pipe onto [Qi Ming]'s face, and [Qi Ming] retaliated with a fierce punch. It was during a student council meeting that day.
0:50:40|0:50:56|Gu Senxi pretended to fix the microphone stand, but actually used the circle on top to lock eyes with [Yi Yao] in the crowd. Unconsciously, both of them had smiles on their faces. Last night, Gu Senxi, who was standing outside the door as punishment, was passing by a teacher who said a word to him. At that moment, a scarf was wrapped around his neck.
0:51:22|0:51:44|The brother and sister leaned their heads together, looking at the phone screen. When the teacher finished work and walked over, the sister explained nervously. After she finished, the teacher picked up the briefcase and left. [Gu Senxi] disdainfully glanced at the teacher's back, then turned back to continue using the phone.
0:51:53|0:51:58|The note says that [Yi Yao] is the girlfriend of the younger brother in brackets.
0:52:12|0:52:21|The older sister held up her phone and said, as Big Face Sister walked out of the bathroom, she ran into [Gu Senxiang].
0:52:31|0:52:48|Big Face Sister stopped [Gu Senxiang], who was at a loss. After Big Face Sister left, he handed over the cute sanitary napkin with cartoon patterns that [Yi Yao] had taken from.
0:52:55|0:53:2|[Yi Yao]'s expression changed from longing to helplessness. Where would she get so much money from?
0:53:10|0:53:18|[Yi Yao]'s mother was giving a massage at home, and [Yi Yao] walked in on the scene where the old man just raised his head and was pushed back down by his mother.
0:53:26|0:53:33|The man with a fat body staggered and sat up, while the mother went out to catch up with [Yi Yao].
0:54:8|0:54:31|[Yi Yao] hurriedly took out a few bills from her mother's pocket, her mother watched her run away with moist eyes. That day, the school organized a trip to the science museum, and as classmates boarded the bus one by one, [Yi Yao] suddenly felt a pain in her stomach by the window. She quickly got off the bus to go to the restroom. Wanting to return to her seat before the bus departed, [Tang Xiaomi] and others came up with a plan upon seeing [Yi Yao] getting further away.
0:54:32|0:54:43|Seeing Yi Yao's school bag, Tang Xiaomi winked at the others. They immediately understood Tang Xiaomi's intention. After some consideration, Tang Xiaomi said,
0:54:43|0:54:50|The driver started the car. The small group, including [Qi Ming], [Yi Yao], [Gu Senxi], [Gu Senxiang], and [Tang Xiaomi], looked even more excited.
0:54:52|0:55:6|A series of buses drove away from the gathering point, and at that moment, [Yi Yao] hurried back from the restroom, only to find that the bus had already left. Standing there, she was at a loss, feeling the sadness deep inside.
0:55:50|0:56:3|[Gu Senxi] pushed [Yi Yao] onto the bus of his own class, and soon the classmates got off the bus and walked in groups towards the science museum with a sense of freshness.
0:56:3|0:56:11|[Gu Senxi] smugly said to [Yi Yao], even playing a little trick to cheer [Yi Yao] up, and the two of them stepped onto the elevator.
0:57:21|0:57:26|Under the sunlight, [Gu Senxiang] walks with a coat on, followed closely by [Qi Ming].
0:57:32|0:57:46|Qi Ming took off his hoodie and put it on Yi Yao's head without hesitation. Qi Ming and Gu Senxiang walked side by side, with Gu Senxiang unable to hold back his laughter at his brother's actions. Yi Yao, feeling confused, found herself once again covered by the hoodie.
0:58:3|0:58:5|[Yi Yao] turned his head without saying a word.
0:58:5|0:58:10|[Gu Senxi] helped him out of the predicament. [Yi Yao] seemed to see in this boy
0:58:10|0:58:29|Seeing hope, [Gu Senxi] walked up to [Qi Ming] and got close to him, standing on tiptoe to look down at her brother. Annoyed, the sister poked her offending brother, but [Qi Ming] didn't look at him, instead he looked at [Yi Yao]. [Yi Yao] lowered her eyes, avoiding his gaze, and in the end, she still went along.
0:58:43|0:59:5|[Gu Senxi] pretended to be calm, holding onto the railing with one hand and [Yi Yao]'s shoulder with the other. On the other side, [Qi Ming] held onto the railing with both hands, protecting [Gu Senxiang] in his arms. Due to the violent shaking, [Gu Senxiang] could only bump into his chest. [Qi Ming] solemnly protected [Gu Senxiang] on the bridge, and as the shaking gradually stopped, [Yi Yao] looked across the bridge that had collapsed.
0:59:5|0:59:7|Qi Ming and Yi Yao unexpectedly developed a hint of sweetness between them.
0:59:13|0:59:41|The self-righteous [Gu Senxi] shamelessly held hands with [Yi Yao], who quickly withdrew her hand and looked towards [Qi Ming]. [Gu Senxiang] lowered her head shyly and with a clear gaze, while the classmates chatted as they walked out of the science museum. [Yi Yao] also returned to her own class bus, tightly hugging her backpack. Feeling something amiss, she continued to search inside the bag. The classmates gradually returned to the bus, including [Tang Xiaomi] and her small group.
0:59:41|0:59:50|Standing in the aisle, [Yi Yao] opened her wallet, only to find that the money she had just received from her mother was all gone. Angered, [Yi Yao] clenched her wallet tightly.
1:0:7|1:0:12|Xiao Bianzi brought a big bag of cakes.
1:0:58|1:1:4|[Qi Ming] picked up the ointment on the chair, named Youshukang. He glared at [Yi Yao] with resentment, then got off the car.
1:1:19|1:1:31|The waves by the river washed against the giant rocks, the evening breeze blew past, the reeds swayed past [Yi Yao]'s slender figure as she sat on a rock gazing at the surging river.
1:1:31|1:1:46|Although it was time to go home after school, she couldn't go home. A figure in a coat walked over and sat on a nearby rock. [Yi Yao] didn't need to turn around to know that it must be [Qi Ming] who had come. [Yi Yao] sat quietly, her eyes gently fixed on the distance.
1:2:11|1:2:31|[Yi Yao] turned his head after speaking, took a deep breath, bit his lip and said, [Qi Ming] continued to ask:
1:2:39|1:2:46|When it came to this, [Yi Yao]'s emotions surged again, and [Qi Ming] didn't want to frown at him, so he simply stood up.
1:3:55|1:4:9|[Qi Ming]'s firm rejection left [Yi Yao] speechless, and the hand of [Yi Yao]'s family trying to take advantage was easily pushed away.
1:4:13|1:4:19|The fat guy lay on the massage bed and vowed earnestly that soon, [Yi Yao] went to take a shower.
1:4:19|1:4:27|The mother came to the table, collected the 150 yuan and put it in her wallet, then zipped it up expressionlessly. This is the way of life.
1:4:27|1:4:41|She was already tired of it all, and couldn't help but think of her daughter. Thinking of this home, her face turned bitter. A bottle of shampoo was handed out from behind the curtain, and the mother got up to take a look.
1:4:59|1:5:12|That is [Yi Yao]'s towel, under the gloomy sky, the river water washing over the scattered boulders and dam, [Yi Yao] stood on a rock looking at [Qi Ming] across the river.
1:9:25|1:9:54|That day when the mother was not at home, [Yi Yao] took the opportunity to rummage through the house, making a mess even messier. Determined, she went under the TV cabinet, then to the small wardrobe, not finding any money. Frustrated, she stuffed all the small change into her pocket, feeling the bitterness of her struggle.
1:9:55|1:10:12|She wanted to experience sweetness once, even if it was just this once. She opened an iron box and found a thick old envelope inside, with five small characters written on it: "Yao Yao's tuition fee." [Yi Yao] took out the cash inside, which included 5 yuan, 10 yuan, and 1 yuan, all neatly arranged.
1:10:12|1:10:38|But each one looked old, [Yi Yao] put the money back into the envelope, squeezing the envelope tightly with both hands. How could the annoying mother not silently love herself? Tears welled up in her eyes, and [Yi Yao] seemed to lose support even in her body, slowly leaning against the cabinet. She realized she was wrong, and at that moment her mother pushed the door open and returned. [Yi Yao] quickly hid the envelope behind her.
1:10:41|1:10:49|The mother snatched the envelope from [Yi Yao]'s hand and exclaimed angrily,
1:11:18|1:11:33|The word "towel" made the mother understand the reason, she looked at the towel belonging to [Yi Yao], and then dumbfoundedly sat back in her chair, feeling that her retribution had come.
1:11:34|1:11:43|The mother gave herself a loud slap in the face, [Yi Yao] shrank next to the cabinet, not daring to make a sound. The mother quietly touched her forehead, but her eyes turned red.
1:11:43|1:12:4|At this moment, she finally understood her daughter's abnormal behavior, and all the reasons pointed to herself. After realizing this, the mother gently came to [Yi Yao]'s side, took her daughter's hand, and held it tightly. This woman, who was not good at expressing herself, was apologizing to her daughter through her actions, as tears streamed down [Yi Yao]'s face.
1:12:13|1:12:22|In the surprised eyes of the neighbors, the mother bravely and firmly pulled [Yi Yao] towards the alley, leaving a silhouette that seemed brave enough to take on the whole world.
1:13:26|1:13:35|From then on, [Yi Yao] walked in and out of the campus with her head held high, the cloud over her head completely swept away by her mother. Riding her bike through the underground tunnel, a sense of determination could be seen in her eyes.
1:13:35|1:13:41|Only exuding confidence. The long tunnel is no longer dim, just like her current life.
1:13:41|1:13:48|Returning from the torment of illness to the original life turned out to be so easy, so carefree.
1:13:48|1:13:55|However, fate seemed unwilling to easily forgive her.
1:14:2|1:14:26|She witnessed the bullying of the girl by her classmates at the corner, and as they walked away, she slowly stopped the car. She looked at the pitiful girl, ready to step forward to help her. But when the girl raised her head, [Yi Yao] clearly hesitated, while the girl widened her eyes in terror. Yes, the girl who was crying on the ground after being bullied was none other than [Tang Xiaomi]. [Yi Yao] changed her mind, she just wanted to push the car and leave this place of trouble quickly.
1:15:0|1:15:18|The soft-hearted [Yi Yao] would not be easily intimidated. She pushed the cart and walked away quickly, leaving [Tang Xiaomi] staring angrily at her back with tears in her eyes. On a rainy night, [Tang Xiaomi] sat on the bed wrapped in a cute blanket, but she was already plotting a vicious plan.
1:15:18|1:15:28|She contacted the social youth on her phone to fix the problem of someone trying to steal her man, and got [Yi Yao]'s phone number from [Qi Ming]'s girlfriend.
1:15:28|1:15:45|That afternoon, [Yi Yao] was lying on the railing of the pedestrian overpass, watching the traffic below. Her phone beeped with a message notification, and she immediately took it out to check. The message read, "Are you [Qi Ming]'s girlfriend?" [Gu Senxi] walked over and saw.
1:16:12|1:16:22|[Gu Senxi] wrapped an arm around [Yi Yao]'s head, pressing it against his chest. [Yi Yao] tried to resist but failed.
1:16:58|1:17:10|[Yi Yao] tenaciously grabbed back the phone and enthusiastically forwarded the message to [Gu Senxiang]. Then she turned back and sneakily glanced, making [Gu Senxi] couldn't help but chuckle.
1:17:10|1:17:21|[Gu Senxiang], waiting for the bus on the roadside, receives a text message. She opens the message sent by [Yi Yao], which reads, "Qi Ming asked me to bring you something."
1:17:21|1:17:29|Please come to the back of the school to pick up, the bus has just arrived at the station. A female white-collar worker on the side hurriedly ran over with a cup of coffee.
1:17:29|1:18:0|The spilled coffee splashed on [Gu Senxiang]'s coat. [Gu Senxiang] comforted herself, took out a finger to wipe the coat, as the night fell quietly. In the evening city with bright lights, on the pedestrian bridge, [Gu Senxi] several times wanted to sneak up and hug [Yi Yao] from behind, but in the end, just raised his hand and didn't dare to go further. [Qi Ming], who was waiting at the meeting point, received a text message from [Gu Senxiang], along with a cute selfie, saying she would be a little late.
1:18:0|1:18:7|You know the reason, [Qi Ming] replied, "I'm already here, no need to rush, take your time, I'll wait for you."
1:18:7|1:18:30|However, [Gu Senxiang] arrived at the back door of the school but couldn't find [Yi Yao]. The gloomy alley after the rain was obviously not a suitable place for a meeting. [Gu Senxiang] approached and gently pushed open the rusty iron gate, holding the coat tightly in her arms, feeling extremely scared. Even the sound of the iron gate closing startled her. The eerie and terrifying atmosphere was spreading.
1:18:30|1:18:42|She still chose to step in here, out of trust in her classmates. The two of them were busy catching dolls, and [Yi Yao] helped him take out his phone.
1:18:49|1:19:12|The two of them were having a great time playing at the claw machine. [Yi Yao] tried to grab a toy but was dodged by the other person. [Qi Ming], holding a gift by the roadside, waited foolishly. Unexpectedly, a group of unwelcome guests arrived at the school gate. Seeing their appearance, [Gu Senxiang] knew something was wrong, so she ran off. She slipped in the muddy ground after running a few steps. Seeing the group chasing after her, [Gu Senxiang] knew it was time to act.
1:19:12|1:19:22|Misfortune struck, and with no other options, [Qi Ming] could only run towards the dilapidated building. At a critical moment, his phone fell from the building and was then stepped on by a thug.
1:19:24|1:19:36|In the game hall, the two of them were having a great time, while [Qi Ming] couldn't wait and rushed out. [Gu Senxiang], who ran out of the street, was running frantically in the old corridor. As a good student, when has she ever seen such a scene, she panicked.
1:19:36|1:20:4|In the midst of the rush, she dropped her backpack off her shoulders and almost crawled up to the rooftop. With disheveled hair, she ran clumsily on the rooftop, almost stumbling. Distant thunder echoed in the sky. On the deserted rooftop, the lonely [Gu Senxiang] anxiously looked around. The sound of steel pipes scraping the ground came from nearby. [Gu Senxiang] was both anxious and panicked, but could only step back one by one, trying to keep away from the gang of thugs who were approaching step by step.
1:20:4|1:20:30|Step by step, she retreated, not even knowing that she had reached a point of no return. The sound of the steel pipe rubbing grew closer and closer, [Gu Senxiang] felt both wronged and scared, with only one thought in mind - to get away from these villains. Three figures surrounded her, [Gu Senxiang] shrank back in fear, but little did she know that the railing, long neglected and rusty, had already weakened. With one touch, it broke. Meanwhile, [Tang Xiaomi] lay on the bed in the bedroom, wearing headphones and leisurely picking her nails.
1:20:30|1:20:50|It seems that everything tonight was within her expectations. She picked up her phone to check a text message, which surprisingly said that it didn't matter what happened to her, and if she fell, it was none of our business. [Tang Xiaomi] panicked, knowing that she was the one who started this whole thing.
1:20:50|1:21:20|The ambulance lights were flashing, the mother of the girl who fell has already collapsed in the hospital. [Gu Senxi] and her father barely supported the mother, while [Yi Yao] stood in the police station hall with tears streaming down her face and empty eyes, seeing a family of four become three. As she walked over, [Yi Yao] stood in place and cried uncontrollably, and [Gu Senxi] couldn't comfort her.
1:21:21|1:21:33|In the past, [Yi Yao] and [Gu Senxiang] had almost no interaction. The only time they met was when he borrowed a sanitary pad for his younger brother, which brought this girl closer to her sister, narrowing the distance between them time and time again.
1:21:33|1:21:52|[Gu Senxi] felt extremely guilty, but couldn't face the gaze of [Yi Yao]. Tears filled [Yi Yao]'s face, and just as life seemed to be getting better, it plunged back into darkness. When [Qi Ming] walked out, he didn't even spare a glance for the pitiful [Yi Yao], who clenched the straps of her backpack, her expression pained and her features contorted.
1:22:31|1:22:47|From the unbearable pain to the calmness of the heart, how long does it take? Thinking back to the beginning, it was a scented sanitary napkin that connected the relationship between the two through the door panel. There was not much opportunity to get to know each other. The accident took away her youth unexpectedly, and she had to close her eyes and stop thinking about these things.
1:22:47|1:22:55|While the people around her kept reminding her, [Yi Yao] was kneeling on the rooftop, scrubbing the floor in the rain, soaking her clothes.
1:23:29|1:23:42|[Yi Yao] knelt in the rain, covered with graffiti all over the ground, the vicious words particularly striking. Her wet hair stuck to her face, and [Yi Yao] could only cry out to the sky.
1:23:42|1:23:49|The bean-sized raindrops hit her face, just like those rumors that are elusive and nowhere to hide.
1:23:49|1:23:56|In the police station, [Yi Yao] looked desolate and moving, with a hint of tears in her eyes, yet her gaze showed no signs of life.
1:23:56|1:24:2|She slowly closed her eyes, leaving behind the last tear.
1:24:7|1:24:26|The sky was particularly gloomy and oppressive, [Yi Yao] stood on the stone-paved dam, the cold wind stung her thin knitted sweater, scattered her hair in the murky river water, and slapped the snowy dam, as if sobbing something, the wind passed through the reeds, as if whispering something?
1:24:42|1:24:50|They were just curious, not concerned. [Qi Ming] walked against the crowd, expressionless, while [Gu Senxi] was also immersed in sadness.
1:24:52|1:25:5|Students ran in groups, passing by [Gu Senxi] without a glance, as the river water washed against the embankment wave after wave, like the endless stream of malicious words.
1:25:26|1:25:41|Until these words reached the ears of [Gu Senxi], he suddenly widened his eyes, gritted his teeth, and ran towards the riverbank.
1:25:57|1:26:10|On the river bank, three rows of spectators stood, their mouths open ready to drown Yi Yao in saliva. Qi Ming walked slowly towards them, while Gu Senxi emerged from the crowd.
1:26:29|1:26:34|Only [Gu Senxi] is willing to stand in front of the public and the media.
1:29:5|1:29:25|The mottled figure on the wide river surface, running lower and lower on the ground, [Qi Ming] was firmly stopped by his classmates, [Gu Senxi] had already rushed towards [Yi Yao], the figure running towards [Yi Yao].
1:29:25|1:29:43|Seemingly declaring war on the last justice of this world, even if alone, even against the surging river, unafraid of being shattered to pieces, the soul remains fearless, wanting to keep innocence in the world. All the onlookers were dumbfounded, and in full view, [Yi Yao] jumped into the river.
1:29:57|1:30:7|[Yi Yao] sinks in the river, and a hand suddenly reaches out and grabs [Yi Yao]'s arm.
1:31:1|1:31:13|[Gu Senxi] lying unconscious on the side, in unbearable pain. Will [Yi Yao] wake up? Is there still a chance to salvage all this? Time waits for no one, day and night we cannot bear to part.
1:32:51|1:32:59|[Yi Yao]'s mother took the cash handed to her by the scrap collector and walked calmly into the house.
1:33:3|1:33:15|[Gu Senxi] transferred to the new campus and kept to himself. After a moment of contemplation, he spoke:
1:33:32|1:33:47|[Yi Yao] stood on the small round platform in the center of the pond, mimicking [Gu Senxi]'s gesture of forming a circle with her hand, looking through the circle at a beam of sunlight.
