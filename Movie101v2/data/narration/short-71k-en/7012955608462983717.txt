0:3:39|0:3:55|[Ansheng] answered the man's words with a distant and indifferent expression, her nail-polished hands nervously rubbing against her knees. Slowly, the title of the film appeared on the screen.
0:3:55|0:4:26|"In July and Ansheng", [Ansheng] left the café and arrived at the subway station. She didn't look at her phone, standing out from the chaotic crowd in the subway. Pushing through the crowded people, she squeezed into the subway and found a seat. Holding onto the handrail, she stood still, a blurry yet familiar face of a man reflected on the glass. She stood there blankly, staring straight at the man on the glass, who also saw her through the glass.
0:4:26|0:4:43|Walking through the subway, [Ansheng] approached. Upon hearing the man's voice, [Ansheng] instinctively wanted to avoid him, but the man had already arrived by her side. A passenger getting off the seat separated the two, and they came close again.
0:5:41|0:6:2|[Ansheng] eyes reddened, she quickly turned and followed the crowd off the train, the man urgently trying to call back [Ansheng]. After [Ansheng] stood still and turned around, she saw the train door closing, the man holding a card holder throwing it outside the subway door. [Ansheng] and the man looked at each other through the subway door, the man gesturing for [Ansheng] to call him.
0:6:3|0:6:26|[Ansheng] watched him leave calmly, then returned to the office, leaning back in her chair and looking up at the ceiling. She then tapped on the keyboard, searched for "July and [Ansheng]" in the browser. She glanced at the search results and saw the novel "July and [Ansheng]" ranked first on the bestseller list. She clicked on the first chapter through the webpage, where July first met [Ansheng] at the age of 13.
0:6:30|0:6:36|The scene goes back to when [Ansheng] and Qiyue were 13 years old,
0:6:55|0:7:10|Teenage [Ansheng] pretended to obediently tie up her hair, but as soon as the instructor walked away, she let her hair loose again. At that moment, a strange bulge appeared on her stomach. She quietly lifted her shirt, revealing a small squirrel hidden between her oversized pants and clothes.
0:7:10|0:7:27|The little squirrel jumped onto [Ansheng]'s shoulder. She disregarded everything to catch the squirrel, crawling through the neat military training formation. The squirrel ran quickly and swiftly darted to Qiyue's side. Qiyue happily squatted down, and the squirrel jumped onto her knee. [Ansheng] finally stuck her head out from the formation.
0:7:42|0:7:55|The coach turned and walked away. The team that was punished collectively made faces towards the direction the coach left. [Ansheng] took advantage of his distraction and quickly ran out of the team. Qiyue hesitated for a moment after seeing this, then followed her out of the team.
0:7:55|0:8:19|Two little girls walked into the teaching building together. [Ansheng] carefully opened the iron gate, while Qiyue looked back anxiously. After confirming that no one was behind them, she and [Ansheng] ran to the fire alarm. [Ansheng] took out a stone from her clothes and smiled triumphantly. Ignoring Qiyue's advice, she aimed the stone at the outer glass cover of the alarm, gestured on it repeatedly, and then resolutely smashed it down.
0:8:19|0:8:43|The shrill fire alarm sounded on the playground, and students poured out of the teaching building. [Ansheng], with a cigarette in his mouth and a tough demeanor, staggered out of the building. [Qiyue] anxiously pulled [Ansheng] towards the crowd. They ran from the school to the street outside, where it started to rain. They played until dark before finally returning home.
0:8:43|0:8:58|[Qiyue's Mom] adjusted the water temperature in front of the bathtub. The playful pair got drenched in the rain, water dripping from their sleeves. [Ansheng] held [Qiyue] tightly from behind. After adjusting the water temperature, [Qiyue's Mom] turned to the two and said,
0:9:4|0:9:22|Qiyue's Mom stood up from the bathtub, walked out of the bathroom and closed the door. The two little girls stood back to back, unzipping their jackets. Ansheng quickly took off her short sleeves inside, and saw Qiyue wearing a white bra in the mirror in front of her. She turned around and said,
0:9:29|0:9:47|[Ansheng] lowered her head and used her chin to hold her own short sleeves, helping [Qiyue] unbutton the back. Then the two took a deep breath and plunged into the bathtub. After their heads emerged from the water, [Ansheng] said,
0:10:1|0:10:34|[Ansheng] raised her voice and quickly, shyly finished her sentence. [Qiyue] smiled as she stood up from the water, then sat back down. After hesitating for a moment, [Ansheng] slowly stood up and quickly sat back down in the water. [Ansheng] finished speaking with a hint of dissatisfaction.
0:10:34|0:10:39|Leaning against the bathtub, Li Ansheng sighed. In the kitchen, the steaming buns were already cooked.
0:10:47|0:10:59|[Qiyue's Mom] handed the dish to [Ansheng], everyone started to size up [Qiyue]. [Qiyue] picked up a meat bun and scooped out the meat filling.
0:11:45|0:11:53|[Ansheng] lowered her head and picked at the rice in her bowl, while the two parents glanced at each other.
0:12:11|0:12:29|[Ansheng] saw a well-dressed woman standing in front of a car, and instantly froze. This woman was [Ansheng's Mom]. [Ansheng] threw her backpack to [Qiyue], turned around and ran. Her mom chased after her, and finally caught up with her in the bike shed. She struggled desperately as her mom forcefully grabbed her.
0:12:38|0:13:3|[Ansheng] was still struggling, her mother dragged her in front of [Qiyue] and coldly said to her. [Qiyue] lowered her head, gripping her school bag tighter in fear. [Ansheng's Mom] reached out and forcefully took the school bag away, then [Ansheng] was taken into the car. Her mother slammed the car door shut, and she curled up in the back seat with her school bag, keeping silent as the car started.
0:13:3|0:13:10|Lin Qiyue hurried over to take a look, but the car had already disappeared around the corner.
0:13:56|0:14:20|In the blink of an eye, the two little girls have grown up. In a barber shop, [Li Ansheng] got a pixie cut while [Lin Qiyue] got a cute haircut. Then, she rode a small motorcycle, speeding through the streets with [Lin Qiyue]. [Li Ansheng] sang like a little crazy person, and the two of them rode to a lingerie store. [Li Ansheng] looked at the sexy lingerie on the shelves and helped [Lin Qiyue] try on some lingerie.
0:14:50|0:15:4|Two people rode a motorcycle to a department store, the gate of which was tightly closed. [Lin Qiyue] stood outside the gate, looking around anxiously, while [Li Ansheng] happily explored inside the department store, her curiosity piqued by everything.
0:15:4|0:15:26|[Li Ansheng] casually strolled around while [Lin Qiyue] anxiously watched from outside the glass. A piece of clothing on the shelf caught [Li Ansheng]'s attention, prompting her to take off her jacket and try it on. Meanwhile, [Lin Qiyue] found the window of the department store and quietly shouted inside. [Li Ansheng] had already changed into a new outfit and was now trying on a pair of earrings.
0:15:39|0:15:59|[Li Ansheng] counted the money, while [Lin Qiyue] sorted through things and took out the pair of earrings. [Li Ansheng] stood there unwillingly, then reluctantly returned the earrings. Back at [Lin Qiyue]'s home, the family started to enjoy a steaming hot pot meal.
0:16:28|0:16:34|The family was happily eating together when [Lin Qiyue]'s mom brought a bowl of snow pear soup from the kitchen.
0:16:50|0:17:6|[Qiyue] put down the bowl in her hand, pouted at her mom, got up and walked towards the kitchen. Qiyue's mom finished putting food in [Li Ansheng]'s bowl and said,
0:17:39|0:17:46|After coming out of the kitchen, [Lin Qiyue] saw the earrings given by [Li Ansheng], she looked at her in amazement. [Li Ansheng] buried her face in the bowl and smiled.
0:18:46|0:19:5|Two people happily put down the mattress leaning against the wall, lying on it and playing around. [Lin Qiyue] gets up to close the door, and in the living room, two middle-aged men playing cards smile at her. It is evident that [Li Ansheng] is renting a small bedroom in someone else's home.
0:19:5|0:19:14|The two people took off their tops like they did when they were kids taking a bath, they looked down at each other's bodies and couldn't help but laugh.
0:19:52|0:19:59|[Li Ansheng] sat on the bed watching as [Lin Qiyue] got up, put on her slippers, grabbed the spittoon next to her, and hid in the corner.
0:20:31|0:20:37|[Lin Qiyue] got up from the bedpan and the two of them lay back down on the bed.
0:20:48|0:20:55|[Li Ansheng] handed a key to [Lin Qiyue],
0:21:14|0:21:22|[Li Ansheng] put away her excitement from earlier and calmly looked at her.
0:21:34|0:21:39|[Lin Qiyue] excitedly approached [Li Ansheng], hoping to gain approval from her, but [Li Ansheng] pursed her lips.
0:22:3|0:22:29|[Li Ansheng] waved her arm, [Lin Qiyue] happily lay on the pillow and smiled, then continued to chant [Su Jiaming]'s name. Upon hearing this, [Li Ansheng] randomly slid her hand on her pajamas, looking at the ceiling with mixed feelings. Meanwhile, [Lin Qiyue] was immersed in joy, unaware of [Li Ansheng]'s emotional turmoil.
0:22:29|0:22:44|[Li Ansheng] finished reading the first chapter of the novel, returned home from work, turned on the lights inside the house, walked to the dressing mirror, took off her high heels, put on slippers, then walked into the bathroom, turned on the shower, letting the water wash over her face.
0:22:46|0:23:2|After coming out, she opened the door to a room where a three or four-year-old girl was sleeping on the bed. At this moment, a smile finally appeared on [Li Ansheng]'s face. She returned to her own bedroom, sat on the bed, opened her laptop, and started reading online novels.
0:23:2|0:23:30|In the second chapter of "Soul Mate", following the novel's storyline, [Li Ansheng] walked to the entrance of a school. She looked mature, but the students in uniforms ignored her. She kept walking forward and approached someone to ask.
0:23:55|0:24:9|The man not far away is the one who handed out business cards to [Li Ansheng] at the subway station. [Li Ansheng] has her hands in her jacket pockets, blocking [Su Jiaming]'s way.
0:24:23|0:24:31|[Ansheng] kept asking questions one after another, while [Su Jiaming] stood there dumbly smiling. The two of them locked eyes for a few seconds.
0:24:37|0:25:1|With a sly smile on his face, [Su Jiaming] saw her leaving and hesitated for a moment before choosing to follow her. [Ansheng] walked alone in the alley, while [Su Jiaming] walked in another parallel alley, keeping a close eye on her, afraid of losing her. However, he did lose her. Just as he stood still at the intersection of the alley, he heard the voice of [Ansheng] coming from above.
0:25:8|0:25:22|After [Ansheng] finished speaking, she walked down from the bridge. Through the bridge, [Su Jiaming] saw [Ansheng] skillfully getting on the back seat of a delinquent youth's motorcycle. [Su Jiaming] hurried over, and [Ansheng] coldly said to him,
0:25:24|0:25:38|The motorcycle started up, and [Ansheng] gradually moved away. [Su Jiaming] couldn't help but take a few steps forward. [Ansheng] hesitated for a moment while sitting on the back of the motorcycle, then turned to look back. [Su Jiaming] was still standing there, watching her.
0:25:38|0:25:48|The next day, [Lin Qiyue] was working as a librarian at school. She was putting the returned books back on the designated shelves, then pulling a small cart filled with books, carefully checking the book numbers.
0:25:48|0:25:57|[Su Jiaming] came to the library to borrow books. She browsed the books on the shelves, and [Lin Qiyue] saw [Su Jiaming] from the gaps between the books. [Su Jiaming] looked up.
0:26:10|0:26:26|[Qiyue] looked at [Su Jiaming], who turned around to search for the reference book he had just returned on the bookshelf. [Qiyue] walked around the bookshelf and approached [Su Jiaming].
0:26:30|0:26:35|Su Jiaming continued to search on the bookshelf, while Lin Qiyue still stood by without leaving.
0:26:35|0:27:0|[Su Jiaming] turned around and looked at [Lin Qiyue] in confusion. Before [Su Jiaming] could react, [Lin Qiyue] had already reached out her arms and hugged [Su Jiaming]'s neck. Then she tiptoed and lightly kissed his cheek. [Su Jiaming] lowered his head, pondered for a moment, and finally gave her a smile.
0:27:15|0:27:23|After school, [Lin Qiyue] and [Su Jiaming] went to see a movie together, then walked hand in hand on the street.
0:27:36|0:28:5|[Qiyue] followed closely behind [Su Jiaming], carefully stepping on his shadow. When [Su Jiaming] heard her words, he turned around to face her, watching his shadow sway to prevent [Qiyue] from stepping on it. Later, [Qiyue] brought [Su Jiaming] to the bar where [Li Ansheng] worked. The air was filled with the smell of smoke and alcohol, the music almost deafening. Men and women on the dance floor were wildly twisting their bodies. [Qiyue] walked up behind [Li Ansheng] and hugged her tightly.
0:28:31|0:28:54|Two people smiled at each other, [Lin Qiyue] accompanied [Su Jiaming] to the center of the stage to listen to the rock band sing, while [Li Ansheng] was mixing drinks behind the bar. She watched the two in the middle of the dance floor, a customer ordered a drink, [Li Ansheng] took the order and filled a glass with ice, placed it on the bar, poured the alcohol and mixer into the glass, and handed it to the customer.
0:28:54|0:29:9|The empty bottles on the bar were taken away, but her eyes returned to the two people in the middle of the dance floor. [Su Jiaming] looked at her from a distance. In the moment when their eyes met, she chose to avoid it, lowering her head to continue what she was doing.
0:29:13|0:29:39|[Qiyue] leaned close to [Su Jiaming]'s ear to say something before leaving the dance floor. [Su Jiaming] watched her go, hesitated for a moment, then walked over to the bar. He stood opposite [Li Ansheng], who sarcastically remarked at him. [Su Jiaming] stubbornly moved closer to [Li Ansheng], who placed a can of beer on the bar and then lowered her head to hold the melon seeds in her hand. [Li Ansheng] also placed a very small wine glass on the bar.
0:29:40|0:29:47|Su Jiaming saw that Li Ansheng wanted to make things difficult for herself, Li Ansheng did not take the glass of wine he handed her, and instead reached under the bar.
0:30:21|0:30:33|[Su Jiaming] spread out his left palm, [Li Ansheng] placed his hand underneath it. After speaking, [Li Ansheng] withdrew his hand, and [Su Jiaming] reluctantly did the same.
0:30:33|0:30:43|Staring blankly at [Li Ansheng], [Su Jiaming] adjusted the strap of the backpack on his shoulder and turned to look at the band on stage.
0:30:43|0:31:9|The lead singer of the band just finished singing a song, [Li Ansheng] laughed when she heard it, [Su Jiaming] turned to look at her, [Li Ansheng] stared back at him with her eyes, [Su Jiaming] silently turned to watch the band on stage, [Li Ansheng] leisurely ate melon seeds while watching the people on stage for a while, then looked at [Su Jiaming]'s back with a heart full of thoughts.
0:31:26|0:31:42|[Su Jiaming] stood aside listening to the conversation between the two, [Lin Qiyue] looked incredulous after hearing it, and [Li Ansheng] ran onto the stage after finishing speaking.
0:31:55|0:32:7|Lin Qiyue happily linked her arm with Su Jiaming when she heard him say that. At that moment, on the country road in broad daylight, the three of them rode bicycles, with Su Jiaming carrying Lin Qiyue in front and Li Ansheng catching up from behind.
0:32:23|0:32:47|Three people rode to the foot of a mountain, then started climbing. [Lin Qiyue] took the lead and ran ahead, while [Su Jiaming], who was walking at the back, noticed the shadow of [Li Ansheng] and chose to silently follow behind her. The three of them walked to the halfway point like this. [Li Ansheng] gradually caught up with the exhausted [Lin Qiyue] in front, patting her head and saying something. Then [Li Ansheng] swiftly ran up the mountain.
0:32:49|0:32:57|[Qiyue] gasped for breath, finally reaching the pavilion halfway up the mountain. She sat down on a chair to rest, while [Li Ansheng] had already run a lap and returned.
0:32:57|0:33:8|[Lin Qiyue] wearily leaned against her shoulder with her eyes closed.
0:33:23|0:33:30|[Li Ansheng] ran away again in a hurry, with [Su Jiaming] sitting beside her.
0:33:44|0:34:3|[Su Jiaming] chased after [Li Ansheng] in the direction she ran, there was no one on the mountain, faint bird calls could be heard from the woods, he looked up at the nearby cave, named Hanhui Cave, then walked into the cave, stood in front of the Buddha statue, clasped his hands together and prayed devoutly.
0:34:11|0:34:37|[Li Ansheng] slowly walked down the steps from above, holding back a smile as she approached [Su Jiaming]. She then looked at the Buddha statue in front of them, with [Su Jiaming] gazing at her. The candlelight in front of the Buddha statue reflected on her face, making her eyes appear even gentler. Feeling a bit uncomfortable, [Li Ansheng] scratched her neck and then said,
0:35:13|0:35:25|[Su Jiaming] approached [Li Ansheng], asking her to observe the Buddha jade pendant on his neck. [Li Ansheng] leaned in, taking the pendant and flipping it up and down, focusing intently on it.
0:35:28|0:35:55|[Su Jiaming] exhaled and looked down at the jade pendant, [Li Ansheng] sensed [Su Jiaming]'s change in mood. She looked up at [Su Jiaming], and the two of them locked eyes for a few seconds. Sensing the awkward atmosphere, [Li Ansheng] wanted to quickly move away, but [Su Jiaming] grabbed her. [Li Ansheng] stood still in place, and after a while, the two of them walked out of the cave, with [Lin Qiyue] not far away. [Lin Qiyue] smiled as she stood up from the stone steps and looked at them.
0:35:55|0:36:1|[Li Ansheng] and [Su Jiaming] looked complicated, seeing both of them with gloomy faces. [Lin Qiyue] asked,
0:36:10|0:36:35|After reaching the foot of the mountain, both bicycles had their chains cut. [Su Jiaming]'s good bicycle had been stolen, leaving [Li Ansheng] with the broken one. [Su Jiaming] helped lift the fallen bicycle, "You two ride, I'll take this one back," [Li Ansheng] snatched the bicycle from [Su Jiaming] and rode away alone. [Lin Qiyue] did not stop her.
0:36:35|0:36:53|Standing still and watching [Ansheng] leave, she knew in her heart that her feelings for [Lin Qiyue] had changed. Riding her bicycle alone, the passing bus slowly widened the distance between her and [Lin Qiyue], taking away not only her physical presence but also her soul.
0:36:53|0:37:5|Watching [Ansheng] being left far behind, [Lin Qiyue] raised a slight smile at the corner of her mouth. She leaned closely to [Su Jiaming] beside her, not caring anymore about what [Ansheng] was feeling.
0:37:6|0:37:33|The next day, [Ansheng] carried her luggage and pulled [Lin Qiyue] running on the platform of the train station. They passed through the crowd on the platform searching for their carriage. The train attendant by the carriage started checking tickets, and passengers began boarding one after another. [Ansheng] found her carriage and stood at the door, while [Lin Qiyue] looked at [Ansheng] with red eyes, tears welling up in her eyes.
0:38:6|0:38:23|[Ansheng] tightly hugged [Lin Qiyue], then let go of her hand and boarded the train without looking back. Outside the train, [Lin Qiyue] quickly found [Ansheng]'s compartment along the platform, and after [Ansheng] got on the train, she quickly ran to the window, avoiding the passengers in the aisle.
0:38:55|0:39:21|Lin Qiyue was not moved by Ansheng, still crying. The train started moving slowly, and Lin Qiyue ran after it. Their hands tightly held together, Ansheng leaned her body out of the window. Lin Qiyue cried as she chased the train, unwilling to let go of Ansheng's hand. The train sped up, Ansheng's head sticking out of the window, holding onto Lin Qiyue tightly. Su Jiaming's Bodhisattva jade pendant fell from her chest.
0:39:21|0:39:43|[Qiyue] looked incredulously at the jade pendant swaying on [Ansheng]'s chest. She let go of [Ansheng]'s hand, slowed down her pace, and stared at the pendant intently as the train moved further away. [Ansheng] shouted towards [Qiyue], who stood on the platform, watching [Ansheng] silently shedding tears.
0:40:29|0:40:39|Walking back, the bustling platform quieted down. [Su Jiaming] walked over from a short distance away, reached out to touch [Lin Qiyue]'s hair, and said to [Lin Qiyue],
0:40:41|0:40:58|Upon seeing [Su Jiaming], [Lin Qiyue] became even more aggrieved. She closed her eyes, and tears rolled down her cheeks. [Su Jiaming] embraced [Lin Qiyue], pulling her into his arms. [Lin Qiyue] cried in his embrace.
0:41:26|0:41:33|[Ansheng] finished watching the second chapter while lying on the bed, then clicked on the third chapter. [Ansheng] followed the guitarist to Beijing.
0:41:33|0:41:49|Skating on the ice in Beijing, playing crazy together in a late-night bar, running out of the bungalow with a toothbrush to spit in the spittoon on a cold winter morning, then brushing teeth at the roadside tap in a military coat, she also exchanged postcards with [Lin Qiyue].
0:42:44|0:42:50|The room was filled with smoke, [Li Ansheng] was choked awake, she dragged the guitarist desperately out of the room.
0:43:18|0:43:22|[Li Ansheng] followed the guitarist, living a dissolute life repeatedly.
0:43:22|0:43:30|On a cold winter night in Beijing, [Li Ansheng] walked out of the room and took out a cigarette, smoking by the alley. The cold air made her unable to resist sniffing.
0:43:30|0:43:43|In the dim alley, she saw the bodies of a man and a woman entangled, the man pressing the woman's body against the wall, their bodies tightly pressed together, passionately kissing as if no one else was around.
0:43:43|0:43:50|[Li Ansheng] looked at the scene in front of her, a sourness rising in her nostrils, then she let out a contemptuous laugh.
0:43:50|0:44:7|The next morning, [Li Ansheng] dragged the guitarist's guitar to a bridge, then exerted all her strength to smash the guitar on a pillar by the bridge. After venting for a while, [Li Ansheng] gasped for breath, looked at the sky in the distance, then kicked the broken pieces on the ground a few times before turning and walking away.
0:44:7|0:44:14|After some time, [Li Ansheng] sent another postcard to [Lin Qiyue].
0:45:12|0:45:23|[Li Ansheng] followed the photographer all the way through the glacier. When the car broke down, the photographer was only focused on taking pictures of the scenery. She lifted the hood herself, fixed the car, and then left.
0:46:57|0:47:23|At this moment, [Li Ansheng] has completely changed her outfit, wearing black clothes and still carrying the luggage she had when leaving [Lin Qiyue]. [Lin Qiyue] and [Su Jiaming] are inseparable, happily watching fireworks together on New Year's Eve. Meanwhile, [Li Ansheng] is listening to the busy tone on the public phone at the convenience store. Hanging up the phone, in the fourth year of drifting in the north, [Li Ansheng]'s mother suddenly passed away. She sits alone in the empty memorial hall, lost in thought.
0:47:23|0:47:35|Upon hearing footsteps, [Li Ansheng] turned back to see the staff at the funeral parlor starting to tidy up the chairs in the back row. After a moment of contemplation, [Li Ansheng] quickly got up and left the funeral parlor. Inside a restaurant.
0:47:35|0:47:42|[Lin Qiyue] and [Su Jiaming] sat at the dining table,
0:48:23|0:48:28|[Li Ansheng] performs on the stage of a bar in revealing clothes to make a living.
0:48:28|0:48:36|In these lonely and drifting years, she has experienced betrayal in love, feeling like a wanderer with no fixed home. After watching this chapter, [Li Ansheng]...
0:48:36|0:49:0|Closing her laptop, she opened an old tin box. She put the business card that [Su Jiaming] had given her on the subway into it, along with the Bodhisattva jade pendant in the box, and the postcard she had written to [Lin Qiyue] years ago. After taking a sip of water, she lay back on the bed, opened her laptop again, adjusted her posture, and started reading the novel once more.
0:49:17|0:49:32|At the train station, [Lin Qiyue] came to see off [Su Jiaming] to Beijing. After a simple farewell, [Su Jiaming] hugged [Lin Qiyue]. [Lin Qiyue] forced back tears and broke free from his embrace, waved at [Su Jiaming], wiped her tears and ran away. [Su Jiaming] still left.
0:49:53|0:50:11|It was drizzling cold rain, after leaving the train station, [Lin Qiyue] walked home with an umbrella, stepping on the wet road. She wearily climbed the stairs of the residential area, and at the corner of the stairs, she saw [Li Ansheng] who was soaked and shivering from the cold.
0:50:11|0:50:26|[Li Ansheng] looked up and saw [Lin Qiyue], sniffed, then forced a smile with tears in her eyes towards [Lin Qiyue]. [Lin Qiyue] lowered her head and walked up the stairs, [Li Ansheng] stood up, the heavy rain continued to pour down without any sign of stopping.
0:50:26|0:51:0|[Qiyue] looked [Li Ansheng] up and down, [Li Ansheng] smiled at her, without putting down the umbrella in her hand, she rushed up and hugged [Li Ansheng], burying her face in her neck, crying. [Li Ansheng] gently patted her back, unable to hold back her own tears. The two embraced and wept on the stairs. Later, [Qiyue] took [Li Ansheng] back home, where [Qiyue's Mom] cooked a bowl of noodles for [Li Ansheng]. [Li Ansheng] ate voraciously.
0:51:1|0:51:16|[Li Ansheng] lifted the bowl and drank the soup, [Lin Qiyue] noticed the red string around [Li Ansheng]'s neck. After dinner, [Li Ansheng] took a bath in the bathtub.
0:51:43|0:51:49|[Lin Qiyue] looked down at her chest and froze in place.
0:51:53|0:52:7|[Lin Qiyue] picked up the towel next to her and threw it at [Li Ansheng] in the bathtub. [Li Ansheng] pretended to retaliate against [Lin Qiyue]. [Lin Qiyue] laughed and ran out of the bathroom. The steam in the bathtub filled the air, warming it up, and it seemed like the two-year-old knot in their hearts had also been untied.
0:52:7|0:52:34|The next day, the two of them carried their luggage and arrived at the pier in a lively manner. [Li Ansheng] was dressed in punk style, while [Lin Qiyue] wore denim overalls. They playfully pushed each other and boarded the cruise ship. While eating instant noodles, [Li Ansheng] couldn't help but tap [Lin Qiyue] on the head. The ship docked, and their journey began. They arrived in Shanghai, where skyscrapers rose up one after another.
0:52:34|0:53:5|The clean and spacious street is bustling with traffic, two people are walking on the street with luggage. [Li Ansheng] leads [Lin Qiyue] further and further away, away from the tall buildings, gradually reaching a small hotel deep in a dark alley. Before the owner could finish speaking, [Lin Qiyue] pulls [Li Ansheng] aside and leads her to a large bed room. The room is clean and tidy.
0:53:5|0:53:29|[Li Ansheng] quickly put down the luggage as [Lin Qiyue] opened the door. [Lin Qiyue] hurried into the bathroom, and upon seeing the large bed in front of her, [Li Ansheng] excitedly touched the sheets with his hand. He then jumped onto the bed, wrapped himself in the blanket while still wearing clothes, turned over and lay on the pillow, gazing at the ceiling in the room. He then raised his voice to [Lin Qiyue] in the bathroom, saying,
0:53:37|0:53:42|[Lin Qiyue] walked out of the bathroom with a hotel towel in her hand.
0:53:54|0:54:21|[Lin Qiyue] stopped [Li Ansheng] from moving, walked to the bedside table and picked up the phone. It showed a call from [Su Jiaming]. [Lin Qiyue] hung up the phone, [Li Ansheng] withdrew her smile. The phone rang again, [Lin Qiyue] stopped her hand-wiping motion, anxiously picked up the phone again. [Li Ansheng] turned and entered the bathroom. After hearing the sound of the door closing, [Lin Qiyue] finally answered the phone.
0:54:27|0:54:36|In the bathroom, [Li Ansheng] faintly heard the voice of [Lin Qiyue]. She heard that [Lin Qiyue] was not telling the truth, saying that the purpose of coming to Shanghai was an activity organized by the unit. She raised her hand and turned on the faucet.
0:54:38|0:54:42|Li Ansheng and Lin Qiyue arrived at the hotel restaurant and were led to their seats by the waiter, sitting down happily.
0:54:42|0:54:50|The waiter brought out two thick menus, and the two of them lowered their heads to look through the menu.
0:54:57|0:55:17|[Li Ansheng] got up and went to the bar. After quickly sitting down on a chair, she smiled at the owner. [Lin Qiyue] looked at her puzzled. [Li Ansheng] and the owner chatted, and after some conversation, the owner nodded with a smile. With the owner's permission, [Li Ansheng] stood up and walked over to a group of people drinking.
0:55:40|0:55:50|Watching [Li Ansheng] finish a whole bottle of wine in one go, [Lin Qiyue] turned away without looking at her again. Returning to the table where [Li Ansheng] was, she was holding a new bottle of red wine.
0:56:44|0:56:50|She picked up the wine glass poured by [Li Ansheng] and took a sip.
0:57:9|0:57:18|Lin Qiyue picked up the bottle and poured a full glass of wine into the cup, drinking it all in one go, as a way to vent her frustration.
0:58:2|0:58:9|[Qiyue] never looked at [Li Ansheng], she stubbornly refused to listen to [Li Ansheng].
0:58:24|0:58:30|[Qiyue] calmed down and looked up at [Li Ansheng],
0:58:40|0:58:46|[Li Ansheng] A sudden sentence brought the atmosphere down to below zero, and the two looked at each other.
1:0:20|1:0:29|[Qiyue] turned and fled the scene, leaving [Li Ansheng] alone in the restaurant. [Li Ansheng] looked at the gazes coming towards her, straightened her back, and took a deep breath.
1:0:29|1:0:38|Li Ansheng controlled the tears in her eyes and prevented them from falling. In the early morning, she opened the hotel room door, slightly drunk.
1:0:38|1:1:4|She walked unsteadily into the room, closed the door behind her, glanced at [Lin Qiyue] on the bed, and sat lightly on the edge of the bed. In the dim room, unable to see her expression clearly, all that could be heard was her taking a gentle breath. [Lin Qiyue] lay still on the bed without moving. [Li Ansheng] sat for a while, then got up and walked towards the table in the room. The quiet room was filled with the rustling sound as [Li Ansheng] took out all the money from her pocket.
1:1:4|1:1:24|Crumpled up on the table, then picked up her luggage and opened the door to the room, [Lin Qiyue] heard the sound on the bed and opened her eyes, only after [Li Ansheng] closed the door did she realize, she hurriedly ran to the hotel lobby, then rushed out through the revolving door, panting, standing by the street looking for [Li Ansheng].
1:1:24|1:1:39|She looked at Ansheng waiting for the bus across the street, the two of them staring at each other from a distance without moving. When the bus arrived, Ansheng hesitated for a moment looking at Lin Qiyue across the street, but eventually got on the bus.
1:1:39|1:2:0|Lin Qiyue watched as Ansheng got on the bus, but she didn't chase after. The bus started moving, and Ansheng, sitting inside, looked at Lin Qiyue through the window. Ansheng was waiting for her to speak, just like the first time they parted on a train. As long as she wanted Ansheng to stay, Ansheng would definitely stay. But this time, Lin Qiyue still didn't ask Ansheng to stay.
1:2:40|1:2:47|[Su Jiaming] saw the person speaking after seeing the box was [Ansheng], and after flashing a long-lost smile at her, the two went to a coffee shop together.
1:2:58|1:3:13|[Ansheng] was smoking frequently, there were already multiple smoked cigarettes in the ashtray. [Su Jiaming] was looking at the platinum necklace around her neck.
1:4:7|1:4:16|[Ansheng] picked up her phone to call her boyfriend, but all she heard was a busy tone. She hung up the phone with a cold snort.
1:4:27|1:4:33|Meanwhile, [Lin Qiyue] walked to the side of a bridal shop and looked at the wedding dresses in the window.
1:4:39|1:5:1|[Ansheng] had a forced smile on her face as she got up, moved the chair, and walked out of the café. [Su Jiaming] watched her leave, while on the other side, [Lin Qiyue] took out her phone and snapped a photo of a wedding dress in the shop window. [Su Jiaming] also left the café, and the sound of an ambulance siren could be heard from the street. Pedestrians gathered around, and as a passerby bumped into [Lin Qiyue], her phone fell to the ground. She bent down to pick it up.
1:5:1|1:5:5|The screensaver shattered along with the photo of [Su Jiaming].
1:5:5|1:5:31|Su Jiaming saw a large truck hit a private car on the road, the driver, a man, was in critical condition. Su Jiaming saw Ansheng being held by two police officers, he pushed through the crowd and rushed to Ansheng's side, embracing the struggling Ansheng tightly. Ansheng struggled to break free from his embrace.
1:5:31|1:5:56|Desperately trying to see the man's condition in the driver's seat, struggling and twisting, [Ansheng] the Buddha jade pendant in her clothes, hanging on the exquisite platinum necklace, fell out. After a long time of tossing and turning, [Ansheng] finally exhausted, leaned on [Su Jiaming], uncontrollably burst into tears, shouting incessantly. In the evening, [Lin Qiyue] opened the chat software on the computer at home.
1:5:56|1:6:0|Tell [Su Jiaming], "Jiaming, my phone is broken, let's video chat."
1:6:0|1:6:7|[Lin Qiyue] wiped her wet hair and saw Su Jiaming's response on the screen, "I'm working overtime." She continued typing.
1:6:7|1:6:14|"I'll watch over you while you work overtime," before the words were even spoken, a message from [Su Jiaming] popped up, saying, "Be good, go to sleep."
1:6:15|1:6:21|She stared at the chat interface, her mind flashing back to the shattered screen photo, feeling a vague sense of unease.
1:6:21|1:6:29|After a while, she picked up the landline phone at home and called [Su Jiaming], but the call was never answered.
1:7:13|1:7:41|[Qiyue] abruptly interrupted [Su Jiaming], quickly hung up the phone in her hand. The counter in front of her was empty, with no one coming to do business with her. The scene shifted to outside [Su Jiaming]'s residence in Beijing, where [Li Ansheng] was drunk and unconscious. [Su Jiaming] put her arm around his neck, supporting her by the waist as they climbed the steps. They walked up the steps, through the dim corridor. [Li Ansheng] staggered unsteadily due to drunkenness.
1:7:41|1:7:59|[Su Jiaming] pulled her forcefully, then suddenly stopped as he saw [Lin Qiyue] squatting at the door. [Lin Qiyue] saw the two slowly stand up, and [Li Ansheng] smiled as she let go of [Su Jiaming]'s hand. She walked towards [Lin Qiyue] with a smile, her eyes unfocused, swaying as she approached [Lin Qiyue].
1:7:59|1:8:12|[Su Jiaming] stood not far away, looking at [Lin Qiyue]. [Lin Qiyue] looked at him expressionlessly, then looked at [Li Ansheng] who walked up to her. [Li Ansheng] hugged [Lin Qiyue] and cried on her shoulder.
1:8:23|1:8:38|[Su Jiaming] watched as [Lin Qiyue] slowly walked over and opened the door. [Lin Qiyue] half-pushed and half-supported [Li Ansheng] into the room. [Su Jiaming] tried to follow, but [Lin Qiyue] coldly spoke a few words, forcefully closed the security door, and then shut the room door.
1:8:39|1:8:54|[Su Jiaming] stood in the hallway without saying a word. After [Lin Qiyue] closed the door, she hugged the limp [Li Ansheng] tightly from behind. The intoxicated [Li Ansheng] skillfully climbed onto the sofa in the living room, took off her coat, and then collapsed on the sofa and fell asleep.
1:8:54|1:9:10|For the first time at Su Jiaming's house, Lin Qiyue looked around the room, Li Ansheng, feeling uncomfortable, sat up from the sofa, lit a cigarette, took a puff, and then lay back down.
1:9:40|1:9:54|After speaking, [Li Ansheng] staggered to the bathroom and vomited uncontrollably. [Lin Qiyue] looked at the makeup on the table, the underwear hanging on the balcony, everywhere was [Li Ansheng]'s trace. She tried hard to control her emotions.
1:9:58|1:10:8|[Qiyue] rushed into the bathroom, bypassing the black sexy lingerie hanging on the shower head, and aimed the shower head at the vomiting [Li Ansheng] leaning over the toilet. [Li Ansheng] awkwardly stood up.
1:10:41|1:10:52|[Lin Qiyue] slammed the shower head in her hand onto the ground, then turned around and ripped off the sexy black lingerie hanging on the wall. She brought it in front of [Li Ansheng] and demanded,
1:11:16|1:11:35|[Qiyue] dropped the underwear in her hand, starting to take off the layers of clothes on herself. She watched as [Li Ansheng] took off her coat, then removed the heavy sweater, unbuttoned the shirt she was wearing underneath, revealing a conservative white bra. [Li Ansheng] reached out to help her button up.
1:11:44|1:11:54|[Qiyue] broke free from [Li Ansheng]'s hand, venting her frustration loudly. [Li Ansheng] glanced at [Qiyue]'s bra, picked up a towel next to her and started drying her hair.
1:12:8|1:12:14|Li Ansheng's eyes were instantly filled with tears.
1:12:57|1:13:12|[Li Ansheng] stared blankly at [Lin Qiyue], feeling full of grievances. The two stood facing each other in silence. Seeing no sign of retreat from [Lin Qiyue], [Li Ansheng] shook her head and choked out,
1:13:17|1:13:25|Lin Qiyue shed tears as she spoke, covering her face with her hand before looking up and bursting into tears.
1:13:28|1:14:2|She subconsciously used her arms to tighten the open clothes, covering her mouth to suppress herself, slowly squatting down and curling up on the ground. She couldn't hold back her crying, leaning on [Li Ansheng]'s legs and crying hysterically. [Li Ansheng] shed tears silently. After a while, [Lin Qiyue], dressed neatly as if nothing had happened, walked out of the room and casually closed the door behind her.
1:14:2|1:14:7|Su Jiaming stood up from the ground and looked at her, [Lin Qiyue] did not look at him.
1:14:18|1:14:32|[Lin Qiyue] stopped in front of Su Jiaming with her back facing him. Her eyes were lifeless as she stared at the ground, then she gradually turned around to look at Su Jiaming's shirt.
1:14:54|1:15:22|Lin Qiyue didn't give Su Jiaming a chance to speak. After speaking, she turned and left. Su Jiaming stood in place, watching Lin Qiyue's back, lost in thought. In the evening, Su Jiaming came to the park downstairs. He ran around the open space in circles. The only sound in the park was the friction of his shoes on the ground. Dim lights in the distance shone on half of his face. Li Ansheng sat on the park's fitness equipment, watching Su Jiaming.
1:15:22|1:15:37|Su Jiaming kept running without stopping, and [Li Ansheng] joined him midway, running side by side. At this point, Su Jiaming's breathing was no longer steady, but he still clenched his fists and took big strides forward.
1:16:18|1:16:27|Turning around to look at [Li Ansheng] behind her, [Li Ansheng] looked at him with red eyes.
1:16:34|1:16:41|Li Ansheng recalled the scene at the train station, where Su Jiaming handed over his Bodhisattva jade pendant to Li Ansheng.
1:16:48|1:16:59|Shortly after, [Li Ansheng] walked past Su Jiaming without looking sideways. Su Jiaming turned around to watch her leaving figure, with the distant street lamp illuminating the tears sliding down her cheek.
1:16:59|1:17:7|This scene seemed to make him see the young and willful Li Ansheng turning around at the train station, saying to him.
1:17:8|1:17:16|Su Jiaming stood there watching her walk further and further away, until she disappeared from his sight.
1:17:16|1:17:37|[Ansheng] was asleep in her current home, with her laptop still open on the bed. The tired [Ansheng] who was reading a novel fell asleep. The door was gently pushed open, and the little girl [Qiyue] whom [Ansheng] had visited earlier entered the room. She glanced at the sleeping [Ansheng] on the bed, carefully closed the laptop, and placed it on the bedside table.
1:17:37|1:17:51|Squatting down, she opened the bedside cabinet door and took out the old tin box belonging to [Ansheng]. Quietly opening it, she removed a business card of [Su Jiaming], then closed the lid and put it back.
1:17:51|1:18:4|At the same time, [Su Jiaming] opened a bottle of refreshing drink at home, sat in front of the computer, quickly typing on the keyboard, and searched for the novel "July and [Ansheng]" on the webpage. The main title of Chapter Seven read,
1:18:4|1:18:11|It's springtime at the wedding. Time has gone back to the past, [Lin Qiyue] is working at the bank counter.
1:18:12|1:18:26|Looking up, she saw Su Jiaming, who handed her an envelope. Lin Qiyue opened the envelope and poured out a house key from it.
1:18:39|1:18:52|[Su Jiaming] took out a passbook from the inside pocket of his jacket, held it in both hands, solemnly placed it in front of [Lin Qiyue], and then spoke,
1:18:55|1:19:3|[Qiyue] looked at the bankbook, listened to [Su Jiaming]'s words, and couldn't hold back anymore. Tears welled up in her eyes.
1:19:8|1:19:29|The two of them looked at each other silently, without saying a word. In the blink of an eye, spring arrived, and the relationship between [Lin Qiyue] and [Su Jiaming] seemed to be warming up gradually. The two of them made an appointment to go to a bridal studio, where a makeup artist did [Lin Qiyue]'s makeup. [Lin Qiyue] looked graceful and charming in a wedding gown.
1:19:29|1:19:40|[Su Jiaming] in a black suit, gently wrapped his arm around [Lin Qiyue]'s waist. The two of them followed the photographer's instructions to complete the wedding photoshoot, and later that night, they consummated their relationship.
1:19:40|1:19:56|As time passed, the wedding promised by [Su Jiaming] to [Lin Qiyue] finally arrived. On the day of the wedding, the house was filled with joyous smiles from family and friends. [Lin Qiyue]'s father was extremely happy and brought out a plate of fruit from the kitchen to serve the guests.
1:20:39|1:21:2|The room fell silent as everyone looked at each other, then turned to [Qiyue's Mom]. She snapped out of it and, under everyone's gaze, walked towards [Lin Qiyue]'s room. As she reached the door, she hesitated, her knocking hand paused in mid-air. Inside the bridal chamber, the bridesmaid, hearing no movement outside for a long time, opened the door.
1:21:2|1:21:24|[Li Ansheng] dressed in traditional Chinese wedding attire, her hair neatly pinned up behind her head, sat quietly on the festive bed. The gentle spring sunlight streamed through the window onto her. [Qiyue's Mom] walked slowly into the bridal chamber, silently watching her daughter. The bright red "double happiness" character and the wedding photos on the wall seemed particularly dazzling.
1:21:24|1:21:36|[Su Jiaming] couldn't believe what he was reading in the novel. He continued reading, running frantically on the treadmill in the gym, tears streaming down his face.
1:21:48|1:22:4|[Qiyue] never saw [Su Jiaming] again. She cut her hair short and said to her mom,
1:22:31|1:22:45|[Qiyue's Mom] used her hand to brush aside the stray hair on [Lin Qiyue]'s forehead. [Lin Qiyue] reached out and hugged her mom tightly, tears streaming down her face. Afterwards, [Lin Qiyue] quickly packed up her belongings and left home.
1:23:11|1:23:26|After leaving home, [Lin Qiyue] learned to ride a motorcycle and embarked on the luxurious cruise ship mentioned in [Li Ansheng]'s postcard. She saw the sea she loved with her own eyes, blowing the sea breeze on the deck of the cruise ship, learning from [Li Ansheng], and taking up odd jobs on the cruise ship.
1:23:50|1:24:2|[Li Ansheng] learned how to ski and became a ski instructor at the ski resort. She wore a ski suit, a hat, and gloves, and skied up the slope on her snowboard.
1:24:15|1:24:27|At this moment, [Ansheng] is in an English class, the classroom is full of people. The English teacher is pointing at the English on the blackboard and reading it out loud, and the students below are following along.
1:24:27|1:24:53|After the English class, students walked out of the classroom one after another with their books. [Ansheng] walked at the end, slowly carrying her books out of the English classroom. Through the people in the corridor, she saw [Lin Qiyue] waiting for her. The two exchanged smiles. [Lin Qiyue] then went to [Ansheng]'s home, looking around at the simple and exquisite decoration in the living room, which was clean and tidy. The sound of cooking could be heard coming from the kitchen.
1:25:5|1:25:21|[Li Ansheng] and [Qiyue] sat face to face at the dining table, with dishes prepared on the table. [Qiyue] poured a glass of water from a bottle of mineral water into the cup, looking at [Ansheng] in disbelief.
1:25:40|1:25:52|[Qiyue] looked at the sweat beads on Lao Zhao's forehead, then smiled as she watched him serving soup to [Li Ansheng]. After a brief reunion, [Li Ansheng] accompanied [Qiyue] to the airport.
1:26:3|1:26:11|[Ansheng] avoided [Qiyue]'s eyes with a smile in her eyes, just holding back her laughter on the side without explaining, trying to restrain herself.
1:26:30|1:26:54|[Ansheng] tentatively reached out to [Qiyue] again, and [Qiyue] hugged [Ansheng]. With tears in her eyes, [Ansheng] held her tightly, wishing that [Qiyue] could stay. But the current [Qiyue] resembled her past self so much. [Qiyue] let go of [Ansheng] and walked decisively towards the airport security checkpoint. [Ansheng] watched her leave.
1:26:54|1:27:4|Lao Zhao ran forward and embraced [Ansheng] with one hand, [Ansheng] leaned against his chest, watching [Qiyue] disappear at the ticket gate.
1:27:30|1:27:52|[Su Jiaming] finished reading the new update of the seventh chapter on the computer webpage. At the end of the article, it said "to be continued." By this time, it was already bright outside, and the dim room was illuminated by the morning light. She wearily closed the laptop in front of her, closed her eyes, and lay down on the sofa behind her. Suddenly, the phone in the bedroom rang, and she quickly got up to answer it.
1:28:44|1:28:57|Li Tongtong took out a postcard from her bag, and Su Jiaming looked down at the postcard handed to him by Li Tongtong.
1:29:2|1:29:6|Then she took out a thick stack of manuscripts from her backpack.
1:29:33|1:29:55|[Ansheng] burst into the café, shouting in a mix of urgency and anger. She saw [Su Jiaming] sitting across from Li Tongtong, with resentment in his eyes. The three of them then left the café. As [Ansheng] drove, she glanced at [Su Jiaming] sitting beside her, then looked through the rearview mirror at Li Tongtong in the back seat. Memories of her past with [Qiyue] kept flashing through her mind.
1:29:55|1:30:10|Her eyes gradually filled with tears as she remembered [Su Jiaming] having a relationship with [Qiyue], then leaving [Qiyue] alone. [Ansheng] accompanied [Qiyue] to the hospital for a check-up, memories kept floating in her mind, unconsciously.
1:30:16|1:30:25|Su Jiaming watched as Li Tongtong got off the car and waved to Ansheng inside the car when the nanny took her away. Ansheng smiled back at her.
1:30:44|1:30:54|At this moment, [Ansheng]'s tears had already spread in her eyes. Her memory traced back to when [Ansheng] had just finished her English class.
1:31:10|1:31:32|Just to cover up her already pregnant belly, but the belly is already quite big, [Li Ansheng] could tell at a glance. She looked at [Lin Qiyue]'s belly slowly approaching [Lin Qiyue], the two facing each other, [Lin Qiyue] reached out to [Li Ansheng] with both hands, the two embraced tightly. After returning to [Li Ansheng]'s home, the two sat on the edge of the bed in pajamas.
1:31:46|1:31:54|[Qiyue] began to tell [Li Ansheng] the reason why [Su Jiaming] ran away from the wedding.
1:32:4|1:32:8|[Qiyue] finished speaking to [Li Ansheng] and looked at [Li Ansheng]'s neck.
1:32:14|1:32:26|[Qiyue] once again fell into memories, she told [Li Ansheng] about the time they went mountain climbing, and saw everything at the cave entrance.
1:33:4|1:33:24|[Li Ansheng] was lying on the bed, tears sliding down from the corner of her eyes. [Lin Qiyue] turned over and looked at [Li Ansheng]. With tears in her eyes, [Li Ansheng] hesitated for a moment, hugging her own arms and looking at the ground. [Lin Qiyue] pursed her lips and then said,
1:33:39|1:34:2|[Li Ansheng] released her arms from her chest, turned her head slightly and choked up as she asked [Lin Qiyue], eager to know [Lin Qiyue]'s answer. Turning over to face [Lin Qiyue], [Lin Qiyue] placed one of her arms under her head and smiled awkwardly.
1:34:29|1:34:44|[Qiyue] bit her lip to hold back her tears, while [Li Ansheng]'s tears had already wet the pillow. She watched as [Li Ansheng] choked up, his voice trembling.
1:34:58|1:35:24|Lin Qiyue's tears still flowed as she spoke, her eyes misty as she looked at Li Ansheng. Li Ansheng gazed back at her with eyes already swollen from crying, choked up as he asked her. Li Ansheng opened her arms and Lin Qiyue nestled into her embrace. Li Ansheng held Lin Qiyue tightly in her arms as Lin Qiyue quietly sobbed in her embrace.
1:35:34|1:35:58|In the blink of an eye, [Lin Qiyue]'s baby is already full-term. [Li Ansheng] accompanied her to the hospital, escorted her into the operating room. After a long time inside, [Lin Qiyue] still hadn't come out. [Li Ansheng] anxiously walked out of the hospital, leaned against the outer wall, took out a cigarette, lit it, took a deep drag, then slowly exhaled the smoke, watching it disperse in the air with the wind.
1:35:58|1:36:26|After finishing the cigarette, [Li Ansheng] returned to the outside of the operating room. She stared at the indicator light above the operating room, and after a long time, the light finally went out. The door of the operating room was pushed open by the doctor. Upon hearing the doctor's words, [Li Ansheng]'s nervous heart finally eased, and a happy smile appeared on her face. She has big eyes, a big nose, a big mouth, and a big chest.
1:36:57|1:37:20|Recalling the events of when they were 13 years old, inside the school building, the young [Li Ansheng] set down a stone, and the glass cover of the fire well was gestured to not go down. When the young [Lin Qiyue] saw this, she grabbed his hand and hit the stone towards the glass cover, setting off the alarm. The two ran out together, reminiscing about their youth. [Lin Qiyue] gradually fell asleep.
1:37:20|1:37:47|The next day, [Li Ansheng] carried the newly cooked soup to the hospital. She walked through the long corridor of the hospital to the ward, then carefully opened the door of the ward. After closing the door, she saw the empty bed in the ward and no sign of [Lin Qiyue]. Only the newborn baby was left by the bedside. [Li Ansheng] held the lunch box in her hand, glanced at the corridor outside the room, then at the baby, and hurriedly ran to the nurse's station.
1:37:54|1:38:2|After speaking, [Li Ansheng] started running in the hospital corridor. Her phone suddenly rang, she stopped and took out her phone from her pocket to answer.
1:38:51|1:38:57|In the memory, the two people embraced in bed, [Lin Qiyue] tearfully choked out words.
1:38:57|1:39:5|[Li Ansheng] held her, tears streaming uncontrollably. As the memories faded, [Lin Qiyue] sitting in the corridor hung up the phone and left the hospital.
1:39:5|1:39:28|[Li Ansheng] heard the sound of the phone hanging up, with red eyes she hurriedly ran to the corridor to look for [Lin Qiyue]. She searched every corner of the hospital but couldn't find any trace of [Lin Qiyue]. The scene returned to reality, [Li Ansheng] was in the car telling [Su Jiaming] about [Lin Qiyue] leaving.
1:39:36|1:39:51|[Su Jiaming] was already in tears, and [Li Ansheng] also had tears in her eyes. She looked ahead and slowly nodded. [Su Jiaming] got up, opened the car door, and walked out of [Li Ansheng]'s home alone with his head down in loneliness.
1:39:51|1:40:5|[Li Ansheng] sat in the car without saying a word, watching [Su Jiaming] walk further away. She then turned her head to look in the direction he left, stayed in the car alone for a while, and finally opened the door to go home.
1:40:5|1:40:20|She carried a bag, with a scarf casually draped around her neck, hanging her head at the door for a while. In the late night corridor, there was only her alone. After hesitating for a long time, she finally opened the door, took off the scarf around her neck, and removed her coat.
1:40:20|1:40:31|She walked into the bathroom, turned on the tap, rinsed her fingers casually, let the water flow to the maximum, desperately suppressing her quiet sobbing, and then plunged back into memories.
1:40:31|1:40:56|Recalling the day when she carried the newly cooked soup to the hospital to see [Lin Qiyue], she arrived at the ward only to find [Lin Qiyue] not there. The bed was covered in blood. Upon hearing the nurse's words, [Li Ansheng] turned and ran towards the operating room. Before reaching the door of the operating room, it opened. With tears in her eyes, she watched as the doctor came out and walked up to her to deliver the news.
1:41:6|1:41:28|The doctor finished speaking and left the operating room. [Li Ansheng] stood still, the morning sunlight shining on her cold face through the window.
