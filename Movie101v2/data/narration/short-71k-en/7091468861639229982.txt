0:1:17|0:1:25|[Zhao Xiaoxin] saw a tomato on his way home from school. He observed it with a magnifying glass for a while and couldn't resist picking it up in the end.
0:1:25|0:1:32|He then looked in front of the alley and found no one there, then turned to look at the end of the alley, where there was no one in sight.
0:1:32|0:1:38|With a greedy heart, [Zhao Xiaoxin] hesitated for a moment, then ate the tomatoes he had picked up, and walked home briskly.
0:1:39|0:1:43|After a while, he suddenly slowed down his pace, and [Village Chief Si Lun] walked ahead coughing.
0:1:43|0:1:48|He bent over, his hands wrapped around his stomach, and slowly walked home.
0:1:48|0:1:52|He had only taken a few steps before falling to his knees on the ground.
0:1:52|0:2:5|He pressed his abdomen against his thighs with his body, trying to alleviate the severe pain in his stomach, but it didn't work. Eventually, he fell to the ground on his side and never woke up again.
0:2:11|0:2:22|Zhao Qixin's father Zhao Qiquan and uncle Zhao Deyi, one carrying a wood-cutting knife and the other carrying a vegetable knife, were filled with anger as they searched everywhere for the person who poisoned and killed their nephew, but had nowhere to vent their rage.
0:2:51|0:3:2|Grandpa, with a worried look on his face, covered the coffin of his grandson. Father [Zhao Qiquan] and uncle [Zhao Deyi], one with a cigarette in his mouth and the other holding a cigarette, looked hopeless and despondent.
0:3:2|0:3:8|The story of Niangniang Temple slowly unfolds in this unexpected incident, and that's when the story truly begins.
0:3:46|0:3:55|Blind [Er Sao] holds a hanging pot, stands straight with his head up, his left hand on the strings, his right hand holding the bow pushing and pulling in and out, singing loudly the Henan opera.
0:3:55|0:4:2|The villagers sat densely around the Niangniang Temple Primary School, with thousands of eyes focused on the blind [Er Sao].
0:4:2|0:4:8|To celebrate the fact that there is a cure for the fever, the villagers were very happy and listened eagerly to the tunes played by [Er Sao].
0:4:9|0:4:18|The playground was crowded, with people sitting on the school wall. Blind [Er Sao] was clapping his hands, shaking his head, and tapping his feet on the willow door panel.
0:4:24|0:4:30|Blind [Er Sao]'s passionate singing quickly stirred up the emotions of the villagers, turning the quiet scene into a lively one.
0:4:30|0:4:36|The villagers applauded and cheered, making [Er Sao] even more passionate and energetic as he sang loudly with even more effort.
0:4:36|0:4:40|[Zhao Deyi] also detached himself from the sadness of losing his nephew.
0:4:40|0:4:48|Suddenly, a commotion in the distance caught his attention. [Big Mouth], holding a horn, was facing off against [Grain House Aunt].
0:4:48|0:4:55|The sound of the horn almost drowned out the singing of [Er Sao], as [Grain House Aunt] pointed towards [Zhao Qiquan] not far away.
0:5:25|0:5:30|Village Chief Si Lun stood coldly for a while, then walked towards Zhao Qiquan, bypassing the crowd.
0:5:30|0:5:36|The villagers, seeing this scene, followed in the footsteps of Village Chief Si Lun and crowded around Zhao Qiquan.
0:5:36|0:5:41|Zhao Qiquan, with a toothpick in his mouth, stood still in shock when he saw this scene.
0:5:41|0:5:44|[Village Chief Si Lun] hunched over, gritting his teeth as he spoke to [Zhao Qiquan].
0:5:50|0:6:5|[Zhao Qiquan] scanned the villagers and was about to turn and leave when he was pushed to the ground by [Village Chief Si Lun].
0:6:5|0:6:7|[Zhao Qiquan] grabbed his hair in frustration and got up from the ground.
0:6:24|0:6:31|[Zhao Qiquan] insisted on not kneeling down, and he fought with [Village Chief Si Lun]. The villagers all took a step back when they saw this.
0:6:31|0:6:36|Next, the scene flashes back to [Zhao Qiquan] burying blood, showing villagers selling blood.
0:6:36|0:6:42|[Lao Zhuzhu] was furious, bit hard on [Zhao Qiquan]'s ear, and then fell off his back.
0:6:59|0:7:6|[Zhao Qiquan] glanced at the villagers, grabbed his crying daughter, covered his bleeding ear, and walked out of the Niangniang Temple Primary School.
0:7:23|0:7:26|[Old Lump] kneels on the ground and kowtows to the villagers.
0:8:2|0:8:3|The school is empty.
0:8:39|0:8:45|With a bang sound behind him just as [Lao Zhuzhu] finished speaking, as if a piece of wood had fallen down.
0:8:45|0:8:53|The villagers took a closer look and saw that the blind [Er Sao], who had just been performing passionately, fell down and died. Upon seeing this, the villagers scattered.
0:8:53|0:9:3|Old Ge Da got up and walked through the crowd to the blind Er Sao. His eyes were bleeding, his face tense, but his upper body remained in a playing position.
0:9:12|0:9:15|Winter arrived in the blink of an eye, and the scene returned to the Niangniang Temple Primary School.
0:9:28|0:9:37|People with fever came to the school sporadically, some brought wooden boards from who knows where, some combined classes on Monday, and simply made beds.
0:9:37|0:9:44|Seeing that the villagers with fever had all moved to the Niangniang Temple Primary School, [Zhao Deyi] also decided to go to the school. One night, he started packing his bags.
0:9:49|0:9:54|After tidying up, he got up and glanced at his sleeping son, then walked over to his wife [Hao Yan].
0:9:54|0:9:58|[Hao Yan] is sitting with curled hair, wearing the bracelet and necklace from the jewelry box.
0:9:58|0:10:7|Seeing her husband [Zhao Deyi]'s face in the mirror, [Hao Yan] showed a hint of embarrassment, her hand playing with the necklace paused in midair.
0:10:7|0:10:16|[Zhao Deyi] was also a bit at a loss, he grabbed his messy hair in the mirror for a few times before speaking to [Hao Yan].
0:10:27|0:10:28|Hearing what [Zhao Deyi] said.
0:10:28|0:10:37|[Hao Yan] tears welled up in her eyes, her lips trembling uncontrollably as she lowered her head to avoid her husband's gaze.
0:10:37|0:10:42|Early the next morning, [Zhao Deyi] and his wife [Hao Yan] arrived at the Niangniang Temple Primary School with their luggage.
0:10:42|0:10:47|Hao Yan followed behind [Zhao Deyi], keeping a distance from her, looking at the surroundings of the school.
0:12:40|0:12:44|Amidst a lively atmosphere, the communal meal meeting came to an end.
0:12:45|0:12:53|The next day, both sides cooked a meal, and everyone from the school came to eat. They gathered in groups of three or four, eating their meal quietly.
0:12:53|0:12:56|[Zhao Deyi] is holding a bowl of soup and a corn steamed bun.
0:13:2|0:13:7|[Zhao Deyi] did not sit with others to eat, but instead looked towards the school gate while holding a bowl.
0:13:10|0:13:14|After dinner, he lay on the bed, tossing and turning restlessly.
0:13:52|0:14:10|At this moment, a sound of metal hitting outside the window was heard. [Zhao Deyi] heard the sound and sat up in bed, craning his neck to look out the window. It turned out to be his cousin [Zhao Xiaohai], who was carrying a bag and a lady's handbag. After throwing down the luggage and knocking open the school gate, he clapped his hands and then turned and left.
0:14:12|0:14:20|[Zhao Deyi] stared blankly at the school gate. After his cousin [Zhao Xiaohai] left, his wife [Shang Qinqin] walked in from outside the gate.
0:14:20|0:14:23|[Shang Qinqin] is wearing a bright satin padded jacket, carrying a heavy suitcase.
0:14:25|0:14:32|Inside the house, [Zhao Deyi] looked on and raised himself higher with his arms, carefully observing every move of [Shang Qinqin].
0:14:32|0:14:39|[Shang Qinqin] picked up the luggage that [Zhao Xiaohai] had dropped on the ground, shook off the dust, and walked into the school.
0:14:39|0:14:45|The men and women in the big house were all like [Zhao Deyi], with their heads propped up, leaning against the window and looking outside.
0:14:46|0:14:57|Zhang Qingqing stood in the cold wind, enduring the humiliation, the cold wind messed up her hair, she looked around the school environment, took two steps, then lowered her head and quietly wiped away her tears.
0:14:57|0:15:4|Tears mingled with her disheveled hair, sticking to her cold and beautiful face, making her look exceptionally elegant and charming.
0:15:4|0:15:11|Inside the house, [Zhao Deyi] looked at Zhang Qingqing, who looked both beautiful and clean in the cold wind, and his heart felt as messy as her hair.
0:15:15|0:15:23|The next morning at breakfast time, [Zhao Deyi] carried a large porcelain bowl in one hand, with an unopened cornmeal steamed bun inside.
0:15:23|0:15:29|With another hand holding a piece of chalk, he staggered to the front of the cave door and drew a straight character.
0:15:29|0:15:33|His wife [Hao Yan] hasn't come to see him for seventeen days.
0:15:33|0:15:36|[Grain House Aunt] and [Shang Qinqin] were holding a basin of dirty water as they witnessed this scene.
0:16:9|0:16:16|That day, something happened at the school. [Village Chief Si Lun] led a group of people and strode into the kitchen to investigate.
0:16:17|0:16:25|Old [Zhu Zhu] opened the gift cabinet to check, then carefully looked around the room, still not getting a satisfactory result.
0:16:25|0:16:30|Shang Qinqin stands in the courtyard wearing a thin sweater, and Zhao Deyi approaches him.
0:16:39|0:16:43|After speaking, [Zhao Deyi] took off his coat.
0:16:43|0:16:52|No, no, no, avoiding the danger as if avoiding a wound, [Shang Qinqin] did not accept Zhao Deyi's coat, so he had to put his own back on.
0:17:32|0:17:48|Seeing that Old [Zhu Zhu] did not respond to him, [Zhao Deyi] lay down and let out a long sigh.
0:17:48|0:17:59|Still not hearing any sound from the old [Shang Qinqin] master, [Zhao Deyi] lifted the blanket and got out of bed.
0:18:4|0:18:13|[Zhao Deyi] walked out of the house in his cotton coat and moved around in the spacious campus for a while. He saw the wooden ladder against the wall.
0:18:13|0:18:20|After hesitating for a moment, he climbed up the ladder and found the roof to be an excellent vantage point.
0:18:20|0:18:25|[Zhao Deyi] had just climbed onto the roof when he suddenly saw something in the distance.
0:18:39|0:18:46|[Zhao Deyi] smiled, rubbing his hands as he walked towards [Shang Qinqin], then sat down beside her.
0:18:46|0:18:53|The moonlight was bright, allowing one to see the wild cats running in the school yard and hear the friction of the cats chasing mice.
0:18:59|0:19:5|Upon hearing Shang Qinqin's response, Zhao Deyi lowered his head and chuckled for a while, then turned and asked again.
0:20:33|0:20:37|Shang Qinqin looked at the ground and said slowly and gently.
0:20:50|0:20:53|Shang Qinqin blushed and smiled when she heard this.
0:20:53|0:21:4|Facing the person in front of him with a smile as beautiful as a night flower, [Zhao Deyi]'s thoughts became more and more unsettled. He took off his coat, covered Zhang Qinqin, and this time he did not refuse.
0:21:4|0:21:8|[Zhao Deyi] stared at Shang Qinqin and boldly spoke.
0:21:26|0:21:29|Saying that, [Zhao Deyi] hugged Shang Qinqin tightly.
0:21:29|0:21:37|At this moment, there was a loud noise downstairs, and [Zhao Deyi] quickly stopped his hands, stretched his neck to look downstairs.
0:21:37|0:21:43|Village Chief Si Lun sleepwalks, and Zhao Deyi becomes even more reckless, embracing Shang Qinqin from behind.
0:21:49|0:21:56|But his hand slipped into [Shang Qinqin]'s sweater.
0:21:56|0:22:12|[Shang Qinqin] initially resisted, but eventually her body went limp in [Zhao Deyi]'s arms.
0:22:12|0:22:14|Early in the morning, [Village Chief Si Lun] arrived at the old residence.
0:22:53|0:22:57|Saying that, [Zhao Deyi] rushed into the room.
0:23:6|0:23:10|The men began to search the women's room in a mess, not even letting go of the shoes.
0:23:10|0:23:19|When Shang Qinqin searched Grain House Aunt's bed, she found the pillow to be heavy and leaned in to take a sniff.
0:23:19|0:23:26|Opening the pillow, there was even a hemp rope tied next to it, so the hemp rope was untied.
0:23:26|0:23:29|As soon as it was untied, rice poured out from inside.
0:23:47|0:23:53|When Grain House Aunt refused to admit it, someone threw a pillow.
0:23:56|0:24:1|[Grain House Aunt] tightly hugged the pillow on the ground and said with a look of grievance.
0:24:30|0:24:36|After venting her emotions, [Grain House Aunt] knelt on the ground and picked up the fallen rice grains into her pillowcase.
0:24:36|0:24:45|Picking up items while crying in grievance, everyone inside and outside the house remained silent.
0:24:45|0:24:50|Grain House Aunt was still crying and making a scene, the injured cotton jacket was found over there by Big Mouth.
0:24:50|0:24:56|[Village Chief Si Lun] walked out of the kitchen, [Grain House Aunt] lowered her head.
0:24:56|0:24:58|[Old Lump] squatted on the ground, silent.
0:25:0|0:25:4|Village Chief Si Lun's notebook still had no news, and the matter passed like that.
0:25:4|0:25:12|One day, Shang Qinqin, wearing a lost cotton coat, sneaked out of the house and bumped into Grain House Aunt.
0:25:34|0:25:39|[Grain House Aunt] hadn't finished stuttering, [Shang Qinqin] ran away in fear.
0:25:39|0:25:48|And [Zhao Deyi] was lying on the straw he had laid out in the abandoned cave filled with clutter.
0:25:48|0:25:50|Suddenly, someone opened the door of the kiln cave.
0:26:6|0:26:12|Village Chief Si Lun rummaged through the boxes inside, while Zhao Deyi cowered in a dark corner, too scared to make a sound.
0:26:12|0:26:15|[Shang Qinqin] also avoided [Grain House Aunt] and came to the entrance of the cave.
0:26:15|0:26:18|Seeing that there was no one around, they walked in.
0:26:18|0:26:20|[Village Chief Si Lun] is still rummaging through boxes and cabinets.
0:26:20|0:26:26|[Shang Qinqin] froze with a smile on her face when she saw [Village Chief Si Lun], while [Zhao Deyi] in the corner also stood still.
0:26:26|0:26:31|And [Village Chief Si Lun] didn't care at all, still buried in his own notebook.
0:26:31|0:26:33|He carefully checked through the miscellaneous items in the cave.
0:26:37|0:26:47|Unable to find his notebook, [Village Chief Si Lun] grumbled before leaving.
0:26:47|0:26:50|Shang Qinqin kept her body turned sideways the whole time, afraid to look at Village Chief Si Lun.
0:26:50|0:26:56|After Village Chief Si Lun walked out, he quickly locked the cave door.
0:26:56|0:26:58|It's time for dinner.
0:27:3|0:27:8|[Zhao Deyi] carried a bowl and a millstone, shouting to [Village Chief Si Lun] as he walked into the house.
0:27:11|0:27:14|[Village Chief Si Lun] is lying on the bed with his head covered.
0:27:18|0:27:30|[Zhao Deyi] puts the magic in the bowl, lifts the blanket, [Village Chief Si Lun] opens his eyes and remains motionless. Next to the board hanging on the ground, there is an old photo of [Village Chief Si Lun] in military uniform when he was young.
0:27:30|0:27:39|[Zhao Deyi] glanced at [Village Chief Si Lun] again, who was still staring blankly without moving. Then he walked out of the room with a bowl in his hand, took slow steps and sat down next to [Shang Qinqin].
0:27:53|0:28:6|On the side, [Lao Zhuzhu] froze upon hearing it, [Shang Qinqin] also stopped eating, and next to them, [Zhao Deyi] regained his senses, burying his head and stuffing the steamed buns into his mouth, while the gloomy sky started to snow.
0:28:7|0:28:9|Days remained the same.
0:28:33|0:28:36|[Zhao Deyi] had just finished speaking when the door was pushed open.
0:28:49|0:28:57|[Zhao Qiquan] wearing a leather jacket, dragged in a large cardboard box. After his wife handed the gift to [Hao Yan], he turned around and turned off the TV.
0:28:57|0:29:8|Several people in the room are unpacking boxes. He moved left and right a few times, took out a bottle of foreign liquor from his jacket pocket, lowered his head and pursed his lips, and handed it to [Grain House Aunt] sitting on the edge of the bed.
0:29:8|0:29:16|Before [Grain House Aunt] could take over, [Zhao Qiquan] immediately placed the wine in front of [Grain House Aunt], then turned around and, along with the people inside the house, moved the new TV out of the cardboard box.
0:29:18|0:29:22|After tidying up, the whole family came to the courtyard to prepare for setting off firecrackers.
0:29:22|0:29:27|[Zhao Deyi] tried to light the lighter a few times, but each time the flame was blown out by the cold wind blowing towards him.
0:29:27|0:29:35|He turned around again, with everyone unable to bear looking at his fist.
0:29:35|0:29:41|He took the firecrackers and hung them around his neck, making his family scatter, then he opened the door curtain and lit the firecrackers inside the house.
0:29:45|0:29:49|The firecrackers exploded rapidly before they could be taken out of the house.
0:29:49|0:29:55|Shang Qinqin's heart was filled with fear as firecrackers crackled and popped inside the house.
0:29:55|0:29:58|The female host of the most dance teams on the internet helplessly watched this scene.
0:30:0|0:30:7|After the Chinese New Year, the heavy snow melted away, winter gave way to spring, and the sky was no longer a dull gray.
0:30:7|0:30:12|The weather gradually cleared up, the sky no longer gloomy as before, becoming cloudless for miles.
0:30:12|0:30:17|The villagers who were sick sat scattered at the entrance of the alley, basking in the sun and chatting about daily life.
0:30:21|0:30:28|Zhao Deyi squatted on the ground, swaying his body, his eyes dodging around, but finally landed on Shang Qinqin.
0:30:28|0:30:35|[Shang Qinqin] was entangled in a ball of yarn when suddenly, a shout rang out in the crowd.
0:30:35|0:30:43|Zhao Deyi hunched his back, swung his arms, imitating a gorilla. The people around, including Shang Qinqin, burst into laughter.
0:30:48|0:30:55|The tofu-selling lady walked out of the alley and saw this group of patients at the village entrance, then turned around and ran away.
0:30:55|0:31:4|A young man from the village walked past them, avoiding them as if he had seen a plague god, and the cigarette hanging from his ear fell off during the process.
0:31:6|0:31:10|Zhao Deyi picked up the cigarette that had rolled to his feet and kindly handed it to the young man.
0:31:11|0:31:15|The young man, upon seeing the situation, didn't even want the cigarette, and just backed away.
0:31:16|0:31:21|Zhao Deyi took two more steps forward, and the young man turned around directly, running away in a panic.
0:31:21|0:31:25|People with fever who saw this scene felt a mix of emotions in their hearts.
0:31:25|0:31:26|Zhao Deyi said.
0:31:28|0:31:30|Grain House Aunt frowned and said.
0:31:37|0:31:40|The surrounding villagers echoed [Grain House Aunt]'s words one after another.
0:31:42|0:31:48|Zhao Deyi smirked, Shang Qinqin hesitated, and Grain House Aunt cleared her throat.
0:31:53|0:31:59|[Shang Qinqin] lowered her head and smiled lightly, then walked towards the direction of the school with [Zhao Deyi].
0:31:59|0:32:7|Leaving the village, Zhao Deyi looked back, then looked ahead, seeing no one around, he walked alongside Shang Qinqin.
0:32:8|0:32:17|[Shang Qinqin] tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, hands in the pockets of her cotton jacket, avoiding the fiery gaze of [Zhao Deyi], and spoke hesitantly.
0:32:22|0:32:28|[Shang Qinqin] looked up at [Zhao Deyi], then glanced at the grass on the ground.
0:32:43|0:32:48|[Zhao Deyi] hugged [Zhao Xiaohai] and carried him, running towards the distant desolate field.
0:32:48|0:32:52|[Zhao Deyi] hugged [Zhao Xiaohai] and carried him, running towards the desolate field in the distance.
0:32:52|0:32:56|[Zhao Deyi] hugged [Zhao Xiaohai] and carried him, running towards the desolate field in the distance.
0:32:56|0:32:59|[Zhao Deyi] embraced [Shang Qinqin] and carried him, running towards the desolate field in the distance.
0:32:59|0:33:3|[Zhao Deyi] embraced [Shang Qinqin] and carried him, running towards the desolate field in the distance.
0:33:3|0:33:6|[Zhao Deyi] embraced [Shang Qinqin] and carried him, running towards the desolate field in the distance.
0:33:13|0:33:19|After the two bodies pressed against each other, the spark of interest quickly developed into a raging fire.
0:33:19|0:33:31|After a passionate encounter, Zhao Deyi was overjoyed and ran hand in hand with Shang Qinqin on the path. They climbed high stairs again to reach the railway tracks.
0:33:31|0:33:37|A train is speeding along the tracks, and when Shang Qinqin sees it, she grabs Zhao Deyi and pulls him to the side.
0:33:51|0:33:54|Racing against the oncoming train.
0:33:54|0:33:58|Zhang Qingqing shouted hoarse, she also had no scruples, only ran on the iron track.
0:34:13|0:34:20|[Zhao Deyi] remained calm and collected, facing the train moving backwards, he even took out a cigarette from his jacket pocket and put it in his mouth.
0:34:21|0:34:25|The train driver, seeing his determination, increased the speed of the train.
0:34:25|0:34:30|Zhao Deyi finally became nervous and turned around, swinging his arms and running wildly.
0:34:30|0:34:34|After a while, the train passed by, and his figure was no longer visible.
0:34:40|0:34:47|The train carriages passed one by one, but he never saw Zhao Deyi's figure, so he couldn't help but cry.
0:34:47|0:34:50|Zhao Deyi stood up panting heavily from a distance.
0:35:19|0:35:24|After a few days, everyone brought food to the school.
0:35:24|0:35:29|Big Mouth urged Grain House Aunt to open the door with a horn, and Grain House Aunt happily opened the iron gate.
0:35:32|0:35:41|Outside the school gate, the patients standing there burst into laughter, with piles of flour, vegetables, and a few chickens and ducks brought by various families in front of the gate.
0:35:41|0:35:45|Everyone worked tirelessly, tidying up what needed to be tidied.
0:35:45|0:35:54|Grain House Aunt carried bags of flour and grain into the kitchen. A lump of a pig smelled the food, drooled, and ran to the middle of the playground, spinning around the food.
0:36:17|0:36:21|Zhao Qiquan pushes a bicycle with several bags of flour on the back seat.
0:36:21|0:36:25|After entering the school gate, without even stopping the car, he threw the white noodles onto the ground.
0:36:29|0:36:43|[Zhao Qiquan] turned and walked out of the school, parked his bicycle at the entrance, and took out a bottle of paint from his pocket. After shaking it a few times, he sprayed it on the stone wall next to the school gate.
0:36:43|0:36:48|People with fever all stretched their necks to look at [Zhao Qiquan].
0:36:48|0:36:53|[Zhao Qiquan] wrote "sold out" on the wall and left a phone number.
0:36:58|0:37:4|After speaking to the people at the school, [Zhao Qiquan] got on his bicycle and left.
0:37:4|0:37:9|That night, [Zhao Deyi] lay on the bed and turned to ask Old Zhu Zhu.
0:37:24|0:37:31|[Zhao Deyi] stood up, put on his coat, turned off the TV with no signal, glanced at the old Zhu Zhu, and then walked out of the room.
0:37:31|0:37:35|But he didn't go to the outhouse, instead he came to the abandoned cave dwelling.
0:37:35|0:37:42|After the intimate moment with [Shang Qinqin], the two of them each put on their clothes.
0:38:1|0:38:7|Zhao Deyi approached and bit open the button on Shang Qinqin's chest.
0:38:7|0:38:14|After exchanging a glance with [Shang Qinqin], he proceeded to unbutton all his buttons.
0:38:14|0:38:21|After a moment of eye contact, [Zhao Deyi] held [Shang Qinqin] steady, and the two of them stuck together again.
0:38:21|0:38:24|After enduring the torment of ear disease, there was immediately a period of ups and downs.
0:38:25|0:38:33|After one night, [Zhao Deyi] got up to leave the cave, but found a lock on the door that wasn't there before, with the sick people from the school gathered outside.
0:38:55|0:38:57|After speaking, [Grain House Aunt] picked up a hammer and smashed it towards the lock.
0:39:18|0:39:24|As soon as [Zhao Xiaohai] arrived, everyone stopped.
0:39:24|0:39:30|[Zhao Xiaohai] pushed open the iron gate, threw out a bunch of keys, and [Village Chief Si Lun] quickly stepped forward.
0:39:30|0:39:35|[Zhao Xiaohai] had a blank expression as he took out a key in front of [Lao Zhuzhu].
0:39:35|0:39:42|[Lao Zhuzhu] seemed to understand something when he saw it and did not try to stop it.
0:39:42|0:39:44|Everyone looked into the kiln.
0:40:4|0:40:6|Shang Qinqin was dragged out by Zhao Xiaohai.
0:40:13|0:40:20|[Zhao Xiaohai] cursed and hung the shoes that hurt Qin Qing around his neck, then dragged Qin Qing outside the school.
0:40:36|0:40:42|In the courtyard, the feverish patients stood in place, watching as [Zhao Xiaohai] dragged the injured Qin Qing away.
0:40:42|0:40:46|After the sound drifted away, [Zhao Deyi] finally came out of the kiln.
0:40:46|0:40:52|He was dressed neatly, like a child who had done something wrong, with his head down and hunched back.
0:40:52|0:40:56|Everyone turned to look at him, then glanced at [Lao Zhuzhu].
0:40:56|0:40:59|[Zhao Deyi] smiled with a thick skin.
0:41:23|0:41:28|[Zhao Deyi] thought about his son not returning [Lao Zhuzhu]'s words, turned over, pulled up the blanket and covered his head to sleep.
0:41:29|0:41:33|[Old Zhu Zhu] sat next to the fire, wearing a coat, watching him.
0:41:33|0:41:40|Early in the morning, just as the sky was getting light, [Big Mouth] and [Weasel] arrived in front of the main house of [Village Chief Si Lun].
0:41:40|0:41:48|Two people did not knock on the door directly, but pressed their ears against the wall. After not hearing any sound, they then peeked inside by climbing up to the window.
0:41:48|0:41:56|[Old Zhu Zhu] poured a pot of wine and saw this scene.
0:42:4|0:42:9|Shang Qinqin and Zhao Deyi supported Old Zhu Zhu on both sides and walked to the side, while Grain House Aunt spoke directly.
0:42:14|0:42:17|He also wanted to show off, but [Zhao Qiquan] stopped him.
0:42:33|0:42:36|At mealtime, [Lao Zhuzhu] revealed the purpose of the two men coming to him.
0:42:44|0:42:46|From now on, they will take care of the affairs in the school.
0:42:48|0:42:55|Just as the words were spoken, [Weasel] was seen holding a notice on his chest, while [Grain House Aunt] carried a bowl of porridge and walked out from behind the crowd.
0:42:55|0:42:59|Two people didn't speak, just stood solemnly with paper stuck to their faces.
0:42:59|0:43:2|After the poster was put up, everyone in the courtyard gathered around.
0:43:14|0:43:26|Before Er could finish the third point, everyone was already drawn in by what was coming out of Big Mouth's loudspeaker.
0:43:43|0:43:59|The person reading the notice ran over and snatched the horn from [Big Mouth].
0:43:59|0:44:2|The matter and the rules were set like this.
0:44:2|0:44:9|After dinner, [Weasel] and [Grain House Aunt] mobilized the people from the school to load the school desks and benches onto [Village Chief Si Lun]'s cart.
0:44:9|0:44:11|Lao Zhuzhu heard the noise and stopped Village Chief Si Lun.
0:44:12|0:44:21|[Old Ge Da] disregarded everything and walked towards the school gate on [Village Chief Si Lun]'s tricycle. [Old Zhu Zhu] stepped forward and closed the school iron gate.
0:44:46|0:44:49|[Lao Zhuzhu] didn't say anything, just leaning against the iron gate.
0:44:49|0:44:56|[Lao Gedan] took out a crumpled piece of paper from the pocket of his coat.
0:45:0|0:45:5|Lying on the signal pot, write down five words on the paper, and expel [Zhao Lianzhu].
0:45:5|0:45:8|Then, angrily picking up the paper, said to [Lao Zhuzhu],
0:45:12|0:45:14|Old [Zhu Zhu] stood still without moving.
0:45:40|0:45:43|Upon hearing these words, old [Gedatou]'s spine instantly collapsed.
0:45:47|0:45:52|[Weasel] smiled broadly, used his body to push aside Old [Gedda], and opened the iron gate of the school.
0:45:52|0:46:6|Old [Weasel] could only watch as this group of people carried the tables and chairs out of the school, watching as [Weasel] and others emptied the school of blackboards, sundries, and other items one by one. He said nothing, just hunched over, standing there blankly.
0:46:6|0:46:13|Until the evening, old [Ge Da] still couldn't relax. He sat on the kang, holding his head, with a lingering look of worry on his forehead.
0:46:15|0:46:19|Zhao Deyi fills the jar with water.
0:46:19|0:46:23|Old [Zhu Zhu] came to his senses, looked at the porcelain jar, and poured water.
0:46:23|0:46:29|[Zhao Deyi] saw his father looking worried, so he gently punched the back of the old [Zhu Zhu] with his fist.
0:46:29|0:46:33|The water in the cup couldn't stop shaking, and Old [Zhu Zhu] shrugged his shoulders.
0:46:33|0:46:37|Indicate that [Zhao Deyi] stops, and [Zhao Deyi] sits down next to the anti-inflammatory medicine.
0:46:41|0:46:44|Zhao Deyi thought for a moment and then went back home.
0:46:44|0:46:47|He walked quickly into the courtyard when he reached the doorstep.
0:46:47|0:46:54|Yang Ci's washbasin was askew on the steps, the basin rack also fell to the ground, and there was no light inside the house.
0:46:54|0:46:58|Zhao Deyi looked into the room, then pushed open the door and pulled down the light cord.
0:46:58|0:47:3|Glancing around, he opened the wardrobe door again, only to find a few pieces of his clothes left inside.
0:47:3|0:47:8|He hurriedly reached into the cabinet, took out a box, and opened it to find it empty.
0:47:25|0:47:31|And so, Qingqing was driven back to her mother's home by her husband and child.
0:47:31|0:47:36|In the blink of an eye, the school emptied again, leaving only Grandpa alone.
0:47:39|0:47:47|Zhao Deyi came to the school to find the old principal.
0:47:47|0:47:49|The old resident arrived at his son's house.
0:48:6|0:48:7|Zhao Deyi is gone.
0:48:19|0:48:22|Grandfather [Zhu Zhu] looked at the painting drawn by his granddaughter without saying much.
0:48:32|0:48:45|Late at night, a large tree fell in the village. A three-wheeled agricultural vehicle was driving along the village's small road, carrying the stump of the fallen tree, as well as the lame man and Weasel.
0:48:45|0:48:56|After getting off the car, they walked into an empty room where a mysterious object was placed in the center, covered by a piece of cloth.
0:48:56|0:49:0|The cripple looked around, made sure there was no one around, and then glanced at [Weasel].
0:49:2|0:49:8|[Weasel] was unaware of the truth, following him around and then following him into that mysterious treasure.
0:49:8|0:49:13|He stared straight at it, wanting to see what was inside through the cloth.
0:49:13|0:49:22|The cripple lifted the cloth covering it, revealing a luxurious coffin in front of him.
0:49:22|0:49:28|[Weasel] stared straight ahead, patting the coffin with his hands, carefully examining the patterns on the coffin.
0:49:31|0:49:34|Suddenly, the coffin lid rose up, leaving the two of them stunned.
0:49:34|0:49:39|After reaching a certain height, [Zhao Qiquan] not far away turned off the mechanism in his hand.
0:49:43|0:49:47|[Weasel] has been staring at the coffin, his mouth never closed.
0:49:47|0:49:49|He lifted one leg and went straight in.
0:50:0|0:50:1|[Zhao Qiquan] smiled at them.
0:50:2|0:50:7|Old Zhu Zhu woke up from a dream.
0:50:7|0:50:9|There is someone knocking on the door outside, calling his name.
0:50:9|0:50:13|He lifted the covers, got out of bed, turned on the light in the room, put on his coat, and then pushed open the door.
0:50:58|0:51:5|[Grain House Aunt] explained the reason for stealing the cotton-padded jacket, and then returned the blackboard, making [Village Chief Si Lun] smile knowingly.
0:51:5|0:51:9|Grandpa walked back and forth for dozens of miles.
0:51:14|0:51:23|The fat daughter-in-law of [Old Gourd] family, wearing an ill-fitting small cotton jacket, grinned at [Old Gourd] on the bed, laughing and then crying.
0:51:23|0:51:25|The old man looked at his daughter-in-law with satisfaction.
0:51:32|0:51:36|A few days later, [Shang Qinqin] was outside the door, tidying up clothes.
0:51:37|0:51:41|Hearing her mother-in-law's words, she spread out the clothes she had just tidied up, opening them one by one.
0:51:45|0:52:0|Sheng Qingqing ignored it and just focused on packing her luggage.
0:52:0|0:52:4|Grandma covered the open suitcase with one foot at a time.
0:52:4|0:52:9|Shang Qinqin hesitated for a moment, but quickly packed up her luggage and left her mother-in-law's house.
0:52:10|0:52:15|The neighbors from the in-laws' house stood at the door watching the commotion, bidding farewell to [Shang Qinqin] as she left.
0:52:15|0:52:21|The villagers sitting around chatting at the village entrance all shifted their focus to [Shang Qinqin] when he appeared.
0:52:21|0:52:30|[Shang Qinqin] walked through the crowd watching the excitement from street to alley, leaving the Niangniang Temple.
0:52:30|0:52:34|Just out of the village, [Shang Qinqin] saw [Zhao Deyi].
0:52:34|0:52:37|After asking the question, he quickly looked back at the road behind him.
0:52:40|0:52:50|The two people looked at each other, and when Shang Qinqin didn't speak, Zhao Deyi asked.
0:52:50|0:52:59|Seeing [Shang Qinqin] finally responding to herself, [Zhao Deyi] smiled. Zhang Qinjin did not respond to him, and the two remained silent.
0:52:59|0:53:8|After a moment, [Zhao Deyi] smiled, reached out to hold Zhang Qinjin's hand, but Zhang Qinjin quickly withdrew it, turned around and looked back the way they came.
0:53:8|0:53:11|[Zhao Deyi] lips quivered slightly as he nervously spoke.
0:53:30|0:53:41|After speaking, he went to grab Qin Qing's injured hand again, but Qin Qing dodged once more. He looked up at [Zhao Deyi], tears immediately welled up in his swollen eyes.
0:53:54|0:54:1|[Shang Qinqin] had tears on her face, but a smile played at the corners of her mouth.
0:54:6|0:54:10|[Shang Qinqin] avoids eye contact with [Zhao Deyi] and lowers her eyes.
0:54:17|0:54:22|Shang Qinqin still did not respond to him, just silently shedding tears.
0:54:22|0:54:27|[Zhao Deyi] tentatively leaned forward, trying to reach out and hug Shang Qinqin.
0:54:27|0:54:32|This time, instead of refusing, he turned his head towards the shoulder of [Zhao Deyi].
0:54:32|0:54:39|[Zhao Deyi] embraced [Shang Qinqin] and she buried her head in his neck, crying in grievance.
0:54:39|0:54:44|[Zhao Deyi] touched his head, trying to calm his emotions.
0:54:44|0:54:56|In the evening, [Zhao Deyi] walked along the mountain path with pots, pans, and some luggage on his back, occasionally looking back to make sure no one was following before striding forward.
0:54:56|0:55:4|He walked over the rugged road and arrived at a dilapidated hut outside the village. After making sure no one was following him, he entered the house.
0:55:6|0:55:11|Early the next morning, [Shang Qinqin] was cooking for [Zhao Deyi].
0:55:11|0:55:18|He put ingredients such as chopped green onions and shredded carrots in the cooked noodle bowl, and then stirred constantly with chopsticks.
0:55:46|0:55:50|[Zhao Deyi] came out of the house, and the children at the door scattered in a commotion.
0:56:30|0:56:36|[Shang Qinqin] listened to all this in the cabin, feeling very uneasy.
0:56:36|0:56:40|After the matter was resolved, Zhao Deyi went to the village store to buy vegetables.
0:56:40|0:56:43|The shopkeeper handed change to [Zhao Deyi] with a pair of tweezers.
0:56:43|0:56:48|[Zhao Deyi] opened his shirt pocket, gesturing for the shopkeeper to throw something in.
0:56:48|0:56:53|Unable to resist [Zhao Deyi] constantly whistling to himself, the shopkeeper hurriedly drove him away.
0:57:6|0:57:10|The two sides chased after [Shang Qinqin] with brooms in their hands.
0:57:10|0:57:17|[Shang Qinqin] ran around the street, scaring off a few donkeys, and the villagers all came out to watch the excitement.
0:57:17|0:57:23|[Shang Qinqin] fled into a dead end alley, and in order to avoid being trampled by both sides, they rode on her body.
0:57:30|0:57:34|[Zhao Deyi] lifted the grain again, and the two young men who splashed it ran up to him.
0:58:15|0:58:19|The two young men followed [Zhao Deyi] to the side of the cabin.
0:58:19|0:58:22|In the courtyard, [Shang Qinqin] is wearing a tank top and shorts, hanging up clothes.
0:58:37|0:58:41|The young man saw [Zhao Deyi] like this and immediately turned and ran away.
0:58:41|0:58:47|Shang Qinqin saw Zhao Deyi, who was causing a stir, with a smile in her eyes.
0:58:47|0:58:50|The sun sets, and the evening glow gradually diminishes.
0:58:50|0:58:56|[Zhao Deyi] and Shang Qinqin sit on the stone in front of the cabin, embracing each other.
0:59:10|0:59:15|Shang Qinqin's face gradually turned serious. She let go of Zhao Deyi's hand and looked up at him.
0:59:17|0:59:22|The two people looked at each other, neither saying a word, just remaining silent.
0:59:22|0:59:37|After a long time, the two returned to the cabin. [Zhao Deyi] sat on the earthen kang, leaning against the broken wall, lost in thought. Even when Zhang Qingqing took off her coat and stood next to him in only her close-fitting clothes, he remained lost in a daze.
0:59:38|0:59:51|[Shang Qinqin] smiled charmingly, her eyes rolling as she deliberately ran a finger lightly across the back of her hand, teasing [Zhao Deyi] continuously, but [Zhao Deyi] remained unmoved.
0:59:51|0:59:58|[Shang Qinqin] stopped what she was doing and thought for a moment. She then said to the dejected [Zhao Deyi],
1:0:17|1:0:23|[Zhao Deyi] looked at her puzzled, and with a calm smile, he held her hand tightly and continued to speak.
1:0:32|1:0:39|In the dimly lit room, the candlelight shines on Zhao Deyi's face, reflecting the tears in his eyes.
1:0:40|1:0:46|Shang Qinqin held his hand, staring at him blankly.
1:1:0|1:1:6|After a night, [Zhao Deyi] still lingered in bed, furrowing his brow and changing positions before falling back asleep.
1:1:6|1:1:11|Shang Qinqin got up early and washed and hung out the clothes.
1:1:11|1:1:20|She turned around and saw a group of people in the village walking towards the Zhuang family's land, some carrying shovels, and a few wearing school caps and dirty clothes.
1:1:52|1:1:57|Shang Qinqin stood still absentmindedly, not responding.
1:2:0|1:2:4|[Big Mouth] put down the tattered trumpet and squeezed out a smile.
1:2:6|1:2:12|The wind blew [Shang Qinqin]'s hair, scattering it messily in front of her face.
1:2:12|1:2:21|[Big Mouth] folded a silver spring flower and put it behind her ear, then turned back to [Shang Qinqin] with a grin. [Shang Qinqin] also smiled back at her.
1:2:36|1:2:50|The funeral procession gradually moved away, the weather also became gloomy, and distant thunder could be heard. Soon, a drizzle started to fall. [Zhao Deyi] got up and sat by the anti-inflammatory stove, holding a cigarette in his hand.
1:3:2|1:3:8|Zhang Qingqing looked at [Zhao Deyi] with tears in his eyes, waiting for his response.
1:3:11|1:3:19|The next day, [Zhao Deyi] went to find [Grain House Aunt], who was watering the vegetable seedlings in the field.
1:3:24|1:3:27|[Lao Zhu Zhu] turned his head and glanced at him.
1:3:36|1:3:40|[Lao Zhuzhu] directly refused and turned to continue with the work in hand.
1:3:40|1:3:46|[Shang Qinqin] walked over from a distance and knelt down towards [Lao Zhuzhu].
1:3:46|1:3:49|[Lao Zhuzhu] saw this scene and turned away, unwilling to look directly at the two people.
1:4:30|1:4:34|[Zhao Deyi] listened on the side and also knelt down with [Shang Qinqin].
1:4:34|1:4:39|[Lao Zhuzhu] hugged [Shang Qinqin] who was standing in the field, but his heart was still touched.
1:4:39|1:4:43|Another day passed, [Zhao Deyi] and [Shang Qinqin] walked out of the Niangniang Temple.
1:4:43|1:4:49|[Shang Qinqin] holding a sun umbrella, [Zhao Deyi] carrying a gift in one hand and a bag of snacks in the other.
1:4:49|1:4:52|Two people walked on the country road, one on the left and one on the right.
1:4:54|1:5:2|After walking for a long time, [Shang Qinqin] fell behind [Zhao Deyi], who was struggling to walk on the crossroads in high heels.
1:5:2|1:5:15|After traveling for more than ten miles, the two finally arrived at the entrance of [Hao Yan]'s village. [Shang Qinqin] waited for [Zhao Deyi] under the shade of a tree at the village entrance, while [Zhao Deyi] entered the village alone.
1:5:15|1:5:21|[Zhao Deyi] said something to [Hao Yan], who was seen bowing her head and crying.
1:5:21|1:5:22|The son walked out of the house.
1:5:29|1:5:33|[Zhao Deyi] saw his son and immediately his eyes welled up with tears.
1:5:33|1:5:37|He turned his head away, not responding to his son.
1:5:37|1:5:40|[Grain House Aunt] also shamelessly went to [Zhao Xiaohai]'s house.
1:5:40|1:5:49|As he was about to push the door open, the shouting of the neighbors interrupted him.
1:5:49|1:5:53|[Lao Zhuzhu] left [Zhao Xiaohai]'s house and found him in the field.
1:6:8|1:6:14|[Zhao Xiaohai] fiercely spat at [Lao Zhuzhu], then stood up and crushed the cigarette butt with his foot.
1:6:48|1:6:52|[Zhao Deyi] immediately went to [Zhao Xiaohai]'s house after learning about this.
1:6:52|1:6:55|He was lying on the doorstep of Zhao Xiaohai's house, writing on a piece of paper.
1:6:55|1:6:58|Just finished writing, and [Zhao Xiaohai] reached out his hand.
1:6:58|1:7:2|[Zhao Deyi] gave him a glance and threw the paper in his face.
1:7:4|1:7:10|After playing around, [Zhao Deyi] glared at him resentfully before turning and leaving.
1:7:10|1:7:15|After noon, [Zhao Deyi] and [Shang Qinqin] returned home carrying their bedding rolls and luggage.
1:7:15|1:7:20|[Shang Qinqin] is carrying a heavy suitcase, panting as she walks.
1:7:20|1:7:23|[Zhao Deyi] walked ahead, leading the way for him.
1:7:23|1:7:29|After pushing open the iron gate, the courtyard was in a mess, with leaves and dust covering the ground, making it difficult to walk.
1:7:29|1:7:32|After exchanging a glance, the two of them put down their luggage and started cleaning up.
1:7:39|1:7:47|[Zhao Deyi] draws water from the well in the courtyard, fills a bucket, and then carries it to the nearby vegetable garden to water the plants.
1:7:47|1:7:56|He turned around and looked at [Shang Qinqin], who was mopping the floor in the house. The corners of his mouth couldn't help but curl up, then he turned around and headed towards the clean water well.
1:7:56|1:8:6|[Shang Qinqin] walked out of the house with a basin of dirty water, splashing it outside while looking at [Zhao Deyi] with a smile. Then she walked to the side of the well, wiping the sweat with a towel.
1:8:18|1:8:22|Shang Qinqin picked up the clothes and wiped her belly again.
1:8:35|1:8:42|Upon hearing this, Zhang Qingqing ran over and took Zhao Deyi's hand, and the two of them happily ran out to open the door.
1:8:42|1:8:48|After the door opened, there was no sign of [Zhao Qiquan], only a large sack at the entrance.
1:8:48|1:8:54|They looked left and right but didn't see anyone, then ran to the end of the alley to check, still seeing nothing.
1:8:55|1:9:0|Two people stared at the rice in the big sack, not knowing who had sent it.
1:9:0|1:9:4|At night, Shang Qinqin developed a fever and lay down on the bed.
1:9:4|1:9:8|[Zhao Deyi] placed a towel on her forehead to bring down her fever, and then brought a bowl of medicine.
1:9:9|1:9:14|Reaching out to touch Shang Qinqin's neck, it was surprisingly hot.
1:9:14|1:9:18|He then removed the towel on [Zhang Qingqing]'s forehead to wake her up.
1:9:48|1:9:51|[Zhao Deyi] looked at him, half-wanting to spit out a word.
1:10:24|1:10:32|Shang Qinqin angrily knocks over the pills in Zhao Deyi's hand, revealing the patches on his chest.
1:10:38|1:10:43|Shang Qinqin glanced at the spots on Zhao Deyi's body and said coldly.
1:10:55|1:11:2|[Zhao Deyi] stared at [Shang Qinqin] for a while, then got up and opened the cabinet next to him, searching for the hemp rope inside.
1:11:2|1:11:5|Shang Qinqin looked away after seeing it.
1:11:5|1:11:9|[Zhao Deyi] angrily threw a stool under the beam and stood on it in a fit of pique.
1:11:11|1:11:31|[Zhang Qingqing] unconsciously looked at him, only to see [Zhao Deyi] wiping away tears with his clothes, swinging the hemp rope onto the beam, then looping the ends of the rope into two live buckles that could fit around his head. He then stuck his head into one of the buckles, adjusting it to the right size. Looking at [Zhang Qingqing] on the bed, a tear rolled down the corner of [Zhang Qingqing]'s eye.
1:11:31|1:11:49|One hand involuntarily tightened the blanket around him, with [Zhao Deyi] standing on it, watching him intently; but to his surprise, [Shang Qinqin] remained calm, lifted the blanket, put on shoes, combed her hair carefully with a comb, and together they stood on the chair, sticking their heads into the noose.
1:11:49|1:11:54|[Zhao Deyi] couldn't believe his eyes as he stared at [Shang Qinqin] without blinking.
1:12:2|1:12:13|[Zhao Deyi] saw [Shang Qinqin] so determined, he couldn't help but feel scared. He lowered his head and clenched his clothes tightly. There was no sound in the room, and both of them stood still on the stools.
1:12:13|1:12:25|After a moment, Zhao Deyi suddenly looked at Shang Qinqin and smiled, then lowered his head, reached behind the rope, and pulled his head out of the noose.
1:12:35|1:12:49|After speaking, he jumped off the stool, wiped the smile off his face, and looked up at [Shang Qinqin].
1:12:49|1:12:55|[Shang Qinqin]'s face finally softened, and there was a hint of a smile in the corners of her tear-filled eyes.
1:12:55|1:13:2|[Zhao Deyi] lifted [Shang Qinqin] from the chair and placed him on the bed, then buried his head in his chest and fell into a deep sleep.
1:13:5|1:13:14|Early the next morning, while the two were still fast asleep, the door was suddenly knocked on.
1:13:14|1:13:21|[Zhao Deyi] woke up from a dream, groggily got up, rubbed his eyes, and ran towards the front door.
1:13:52|1:14:0|Zhang Qingqing walked out of the house, bent down to pick up the marriage certificate on the ground, brushed off the dust on it, and hugged it as if she had obtained a treasure.
1:14:0|1:14:3|Zhao Deyi was still looking in the direction where his brother [Zhao Qiquan] had left.
1:14:4|1:14:11|After getting dressed and holding money in her hand, [Shang Qinqin] happily arrived at the front of the store.
1:14:11|1:14:21|The shopkeeper had just finished washing his face by chance. When he saw him approaching, he turned around and opened the shop door.
1:14:21|1:14:24|Zhao Deyi, who woke up from a coma, reached out and touched the bed beside him.
1:14:27|1:14:45|For half a day, no one responded to him. Exhausted, he propped up his neck and searched for [Shang Qinqin] in the room, then weakly laid his head on the pillow, extending an arm and calling out softly.
1:14:45|1:14:48|[Shang Qinqin] is sitting in front of the dressing table, carefully putting on makeup.
1:14:51|1:14:59|Hearing Zhao Deyi calling herself "mom", [Shang Qinqin] laughed and walked to the bedside, holding his hand, and happily said to him.
1:15:1|1:15:7|After speaking, with her eyes closed, she leaned her head towards him, and Zhao Deyi gently touched her forehead with his hand.
1:15:7|1:15:12|[Shang Qinqin] turned around again and ran to the dressing table to pick up a package.
1:15:19|1:15:23|Shang Qinqin pulled him up from the bed and tidied his hair.
1:15:29|1:15:33|[Zhao Deyi] smiled at him and then collapsed back onto the bed.
1:15:36|1:15:42|[Shang Qinqin] tried to pull his arm to help him up, but all in vain.
1:15:42|1:15:45|He pulled down [Zhao Deyi]'s pants and bit his buttocks.
1:15:49|1:15:55|After dressing neatly, Zhao Deyi, hand in hand with Shang Qinqin, went door to door to distribute candies to the villagers.
1:16:2|1:16:9|The villager hesitated to accept the candy handed to him from behind, feeling awkward but unable to refuse, so he had to lift his apron and take the candy.
1:16:14|1:16:18|The villagers at the village entrance all refused their wedding candies.
1:16:24|1:16:35|[Shang Qinqin] didn't care at all, proudly showing off the marriage certificate to others, and the two of them playfully knocked on another door.
1:16:52|1:16:56|[Weasel] forced a smile and then closed the door firmly.
1:17:1|1:17:9|[Zhao Deyi] grabbed a handful of candy and threw it into the courtyard, then peeled one open to feed [Shang Qinqin].
1:17:10|1:17:14|In the courtyard, [Weasel] squatted down and picked up the sugar one by one.
1:17:17|1:17:25|Then the wedding candies were placed on the table at home, and they were divided into two small piles, with one pile being put into the empty bowl in front.
1:17:25|1:17:32|Behind the bowl is a memorial photo of a young woman, with a joint photo of her and him clipped in the lower right corner.
1:17:32|1:17:39|She tore open a piece of candy wrapper, stuffed the candy into her mouth, but tears and snot couldn't help but flow down.
1:17:39|1:17:41|She looked at the photo, unable to stop sobbing.
1:17:42|1:17:46|After handing out the candy, [Shang Qinqin] and [Zhao Deyi] went to the railway tracks.
1:17:52|1:18:16|At this moment, the two of them were immersed in the joy of their new marriage. They were far away from the village, holding hands and wandering on the railway tracks. [Village Chief Si Lun] sat alone in the school, the courtyard empty. He was at a loss, with his arms on his knees, looking left and right. In the not-so-distant mountains, firecrackers sounded loudly.
1:18:29|1:18:40|[Zhao Qiquan] led a large group of people to dig up his son [Zhao Xiaoxin]'s coffin, wrapped the old coffin in a piece of festive silk fabric, and placed it in a luxurious coffin.
1:18:41|1:18:53|Several people are carrying a coffin at the front, followed closely by others holding two paper figures. One paper figure has a photo of [Zhao Xiaoxin] on its head, while the other has a photo of a woman.
1:18:53|1:19:1|Continuing on, the person behind is carrying paper-made luxury cars, ships, and airplanes, as well as large amounts of banknotes, credit cards, and other items.
1:19:2|1:19:8|In the coffin car of [Zhao Xiaoxin], there are also a cameraman and a person shouting and singing.
1:19:8|1:19:12|In this way, the coffin of [Zhao Xiaoxin] was carried out of the Temple of the Earth in a grand procession.
1:19:27|1:19:34|After his son Zhao Xiaoxin's wedding, Zhao Qiquan was in high spirits and rode his motorcycle singing loudly.
1:19:34|1:19:38|[Teacher Zhu Zhu] in the school heard the sound and ran out quickly.
1:19:38|1:19:44|He frowned, his heart filled with mixed emotions, the suppressed anger forcing him to quicken his pace.
1:19:44|1:19:48|At the bend in the path, he successfully met his son [Zhao Qiquan].
1:19:48|1:19:53|[Zhao Qiquan] stops the motorcycle.
1:20:52|1:20:59|[Old Zhu Zhu] looked weakly at [Zhao Qiquan], as the sky darkened, and the second son of the newlyweds, [Zhao Deyi], got into trouble again on their wedding night.
1:21:8|1:21:14|[Zhao Deyi] was sweating profusely, writhing in pain on the bed, biting the bedding hard.
1:21:14|1:21:18|Shang Qinqin hugged him tightly, pressing her body against his back.
1:23:15|1:23:20|[Zhao Deyi]'s mind is becoming increasingly unclear, in the midst of confusion, he even reminds [Shang Qinqin] not to forget to wake himself up.
1:23:21|1:23:25|After saying that, she passed out completely in pain.
1:23:25|1:23:29|Zhang Qingqing hugged his head, constantly stroking the face of [Zhao Deyi].
1:23:29|1:23:33|In the middle of the night, [Zhao Deyi]'s condition worsened and became uncontrollable.
1:23:33|1:23:41|In order to alleviate Zhao Deyi's condition, Zhang Qingqing dragged her weak body and fetched a basin of cold water from the well.
1:23:41|1:23:44|[Zhao Deyi] breathed heavily, feeling like his body was being roasted by fire.
1:23:47|1:23:57|Shang Qinqin placed the wet towel on her forehead, but Zhao Deyi still felt like there was a fire burning inside her body.
1:23:57|1:24:4|Shang Qinqin kept shuttling back and forth between the house and the courtyard, constantly pushing down and lifting the handle.
1:24:4|1:24:6|Zhao Deyi moaned weakly in the house.
1:24:10|1:24:23|Shang Qinqin kept wiping Zhao Deyi's body with a towel, then ran to the yard to change water, back and forth, consuming a lot of his energy. The basin filled with water, for him at this moment,
1:24:23|1:24:27|It was undoubtedly a lump of iron, but he dared not slack off and quickly carried it into the house.
1:24:31|1:24:41|[Zhao Deyi]'s symptoms showed no signs of improvement. Towels were changed one after another, but in a blink of an eye, his body was burning hot.
1:24:41|1:24:47|Shang Qinqin, who was fetching water, had run out of strength. She stopped her movements and stood by the well, panting heavily.
1:24:52|1:25:0|[Zhao Deyi] was still shouting, without much thought, he took off his clothes and lifted his leg to sit in the cold water tub in the middle of the courtyard.
1:25:0|1:25:13|The piercing cold made him unable to help but exhale a breath, and then [Zhang Qingqing]'s body kept trembling, but he still sat inside, letting the cold water penetrate his warmth.
1:25:13|1:25:16|[Zhao Deyi] lay on the bed in pain, screaming.
1:25:24|1:25:34|After her body cooled down, [Shang Qinqin] emerged from the water tank, quickly put on her slippers, and the ice water flowed down her body, soaking the bricks and tiles in the courtyard.
1:25:34|1:25:41|She pressed her icy body against Zhao Deyi's hot body, and Zhao Deyi immediately hugged her trembling body.
1:25:42|1:25:47|At this moment, the temporary coolness finally eased his impatience.
1:25:47|1:25:59|But soon after, Shang Qinqin's body was also heated up by him, so Shang Qinqin had to immerse her body in the cold water tank again.
1:26:7|1:26:14|[Zhang Qingqing] stepped out of the water tank again, her hands crossed weakly in front of her chest, unable to resist the cold night wind.
1:26:14|1:26:16|Walking barefoot into the room, she immediately leaned close to [Zhao Deyi].
1:26:18|1:26:28|When the burning sensation in his body gradually subsided, the cries of [Zhao Deyi] finally stopped, and [Shang Qinqin] stayed close to him, absorbing the dryness and heat from his body.
1:26:28|1:26:38|When his body was warmed up by him again, he ran to the yard, immersed his body in the cold water tank, then ran back to stick to [Zhao Deyi], repeating this process continuously.
1:26:40|1:26:48|Getting in and out of bed, into the water tank and out of it, dragging her cold and weak body without any slack, [Shang Qinqin] persevered.
1:26:48|1:26:53|Zhao Deyi's heat and boredom, after countless back and forth trips, finally found relief.
1:26:53|1:26:58|He fell asleep heavily against Shang Qinqin's cold body.
1:26:58|1:27:1|[Shang Qinqin] also lay in his arms, exhausted and fell asleep.
1:27:1|1:27:5|The two of them snuggled closely together, spending their wedding night.
1:27:5|1:27:9|Early the next morning, the entire Niangniang Temple village was still immersed in silence.
1:27:10|1:27:15|After a whole night of suffering from illness, [Zhao Deyi] finally regained consciousness.
1:27:15|1:27:25|His lips were cracked and had a layer of skin peeling off. The skin on the upper lip was sticking to the skin on the lower lip, and then he swallowed some saliva.
1:27:30|1:27:34|Seeing no one responding, he weakly shook his head and swallowed saliva.
1:27:38|1:27:47|The room was still quiet, with no one responding. He reached out his hand, habitually feeling towards the other side of the bed, but did not touch the familiar body as usual.
1:28:8|1:28:12|At this moment, [Shang Qinqin] is lying half-naked on the ground, covered with a thin blanket.
1:28:12|1:28:17|[Zhao Deyi] pounded down another hand, swinging it wildly.
1:28:17|1:28:23|[Shang Qinqin] still lay on the ground, without any response.
1:28:23|1:28:32|[Zhao Deyi] pursed his lips, struggled to open his eyes, and habitually reached out his hand towards the dressing table, gesturing for [Shang Qinqin] to come to his side.
1:28:37|1:28:42|He repeatedly shook his wrist, but still did not receive those warm hands.
1:28:42|1:28:51|After a while, he slowly raised his neck and looked towards the dressing table, seeing no one. Then he turned to the other side and caught a glimpse of the injured Qin Qing lying on the ground.
1:28:52|1:28:55|Shang Qinqin remained motionless, her face pale and bloodless.
1:28:55|1:29:1|Zhao Deyi gazed at [Zhao Qiquan] for a long time, and his wedding clothes were neatly placed on the ground.
1:29:1|1:29:7|Zhao Deyi stood up shirtless, holding a machete, and chopped at his own thigh repeatedly.
1:29:7|1:29:12|Last night, he was rolling in pain, but now he seems to feel no pain at all.
1:29:12|1:29:17|He looked at Zhao Qiquan on the ground with a bitter smile, once again swinging the machete towards his own thigh.
1:29:21|1:29:26|Sunlight streamed in through the window, falling directly on [Zhao Deyi], as he looked at [Shang Qinqin] and smiled.
1:29:29|1:29:38|The veins on her forehead bulged, as if this sound had drained all her strength, and tears kept flowing from her eyes.
1:29:38|1:29:44|But at this moment, despite the myriad of emotions flooding her heart, she could only look at [Shang Qinqin] in despair.
1:29:44|1:29:51|The temple of the goddess is still so quiet, with festive stickers on the walls outside, but a pool of blood is seeping out from between the cracks in the wall.
1:29:52|1:29:56|In the room, the marriage certificate on the floor still had the photos of two people attached to it.
1:29:56|1:30:14|In his dying moments, [Zhao Deyi] seemed to see the day before his wedding, when he and Shang Qinqin went to give wedding candies to [Weasel].
1:30:31|1:30:36|Zhang Qingqing had a piece of candy in her mouth, [Zhao Deyi] leaned against the wall, reaching out his hand to her.
1:30:36|1:30:42|Zhang Qingqing blushed and leaned towards him, holding his hand and reading the marriage certificate aloud.
1:31:0|1:31:6|[Zhao Deyi] looked at [Shang Qinqin] with deep affection in his eyes, which were also moistened by tears.
1:31:49|1:31:51|The two of them just smiled at each other like that.
