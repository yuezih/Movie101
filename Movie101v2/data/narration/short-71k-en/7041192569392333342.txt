0:1:24|0:1:33|The man in a wedding dress is gradually sinking in the sea. He watches the dollar bills floating not far away and tries hard to reach for them, but he doesn't catch a single one. The hair on his forehead is stuck to his eyes by the water.
0:1:34|0:1:44|The veil on the head scattered in the water, oxygen gradually depleting, the outstretched hands slowly drooping, and the body sinking slowly.
0:1:44|0:2:11|Time rewinds, back to a day ago on a deserted island where a group of young men and women are dancing joyfully to music. The story is about to unfold from here. The film mainly tells the story of the poor boy [Li Cha] and the world's richest woman [Auntie]. Since [Li Cha] was born, the two have never met. In order to marry the daughter of a wealthy businessman, [Li Cha] pleads with [Auntie] to help him. However, the group, each with their own hidden agenda, mistakenly takes male employee [Huang Canghai] as [Auntie].
0:2:11|0:2:18|In order to further their own interests, [Huang Canghai], [Li Cha], along with Liang [Jie Rui], teamed up to disguise themselves as [Auntie].
0:2:18|0:2:25|As everyone was trying to please the fake [Auntie], the mysterious real [Auntie] suddenly appeared, leading to a series of hilarious events.
0:2:25|0:2:41|In the film, the poor boy [Li Cha] is played by Song Yang, the female tycoon [Auntie] is played by Lu Jingshan, the male employee [Huang Canghai] is played by Huang Cailun, Liang [Jie Rui] is played by Allen. As the main story begins, a man in a wedding dress is dancing on the beach with many handsome men and beautiful women.
0:2:41|0:2:50|He was thrown high up by everyone, and in an instant, banknotes scattered everywhere. People swarmed to grab the banknotes, and the man fell heavily to the ground, dodging awkwardly with a face distorted by pain.
0:3:15|0:3:42|[Huang Canghai] hung up the phone, then rode his beach motorcycle towards the distance, a luxurious cruise ship slowly moving on the sea. [Wang Canghai] quickly met the well-dressed chairman's family, then set off again to greet the arrival of Mrs. Monica. They waited for a long time, but still did not see Mrs. Monica's shadow, so they had to stand idly under the pavilion. Suddenly, a man in a suit lying on the ground sat up, and the man with braided hair beside him said,
0:4:5|0:4:22|A tall and thin man stood aside explaining. The thin man looked pleased, [Li Cha] had a smile on his face, while the bride had a stern expression.
0:5:56|0:6:18|[Jie Rui] dramatically threw off his clothes, showing off his body to the female shop assistant. The shop assistant, mesmerized by [Jie Rui]'s flamboyant moves, watched with fascination. As [Jie Rui] took the clothes and threw them behind him, he turned around and started getting dressed. Just as he turned back, he saw his wife give him a cold look and walk away.
0:6:30|0:6:48|[Liang Youde] walked forward alone, [Jie Rui] ran up and patted him on the shoulder. [Liang Youde] turned his head to look at his son with a bitter smile, then spoke. [Jie Rui] took off his sunglasses and asked. [Liang Youde]'s lips trembled, and suddenly dark clouds filled the sky.
0:7:22|0:7:28|[Jie Rui] hurriedly crouched down to pick it up, while [Liang Youde] put on a swimming cap.
0:8:35|0:8:54|The cashier placed a bill several meters long on the counter, with a total amount of $57,800. [Huang Canghai] hesitated for a moment, picked up a spherical object, and was about to eat it.
0:9:1|0:9:15|He picked up the container and stuffed it into his mouth, [Huang Canghai] froze instantly, quickly spitting out the mouthful of camphor pills. As time passed by, [Li Cha]'s [Auntie] was still nowhere to be seen, and everyone was getting impatient.
0:9:35|0:9:39|Li Cha's smile froze on his face, and he hesitated as he faced the eager gazes of everyone, saying,
0:9:56|0:10:4|[Wang Andi] immediately reached out and put his arm around [Li Cha]'s shoulder, saying to him.
0:10:13|0:10:21|The fat man on the ship looked through the telescope and took everything in, then he chuckled and asked.
0:10:22|0:10:47|The tall and thin man answered calmly, while the chubby man seemed a bit confused. They both lowered their heads to look at the sea, where the sparkling waves occasionally splashed. The huge ship appeared very small on the sea. A slender woman was swimming freely in the water at this moment, wearing a diving mask, a two-piece bikini, and using a pair of long duck feet as fins.
0:10:47|0:10:54|With her hands naturally placed on both sides of her body, [Huang Canghai] swam towards the deep sea, her loose hair floating in the water with her movements.
0:10:54|0:11:0|Several dolphins swam past her side as if they regarded her as one of their own kind, showing no signs of being scared.
0:11:0|0:11:5|At this moment, the title "Auntie Li Cha" appeared in big letters in the center of the screen.
0:11:6|0:11:13|After a while, the woman left the sea and returned to the ship, where the tall and thin man hurried forward to help her put on a bathrobe.
0:11:17|0:11:24|The woman, Auntie [Li Cha], Mrs. Monica, picked up a glass of water and replied. The fat man hurried forward to ask.
0:11:59|0:12:4|Mrs. Monica helplessly waved her hand, the fat man and the tall thin man then silly smiled at each other and gave a thumbs up.
0:12:51|0:13:7|After finishing the call with his mother, [Huang Canghai] immediately returned to his true residence: a rundown cabin. He sat on a small stool and desperately sent messages to Xiaoxi, but she seemed unwilling to respond.
0:13:21|0:13:32|[Jie Rui] casually tossed the coconut in his hand, causing several nearby cargo ships to capsize.
0:13:42|0:13:47|[Li Cha] gritted his teeth and ran away, with [Jie Rui] muttering as he hurried to catch up.
0:14:9|0:14:24|[Huang Canghai] ran out of the beach screaming, and shortly after he left, Mrs. Monica suddenly appeared in a tight diving suit next to the wrecked ship. She threw the diving gear towards the sea, shook her dripping long hair, and ran towards the center of the island.
0:14:31|0:14:38|[Huang Canghai] ran into the room prepared for [Mrs. Monica] and started taking crazy photos to show off.
0:14:45|0:15:7|He alternated between touching the parrot ornament and the potted plant, then sat in front of the piano with his eyes closed, swaying his head as if he were a musician. He crazily played the piano, and suddenly peeled an orange to eat. The chewing of the orange became more vigorous along with the music. Then he opened an expensive box of cigars, lit one, took a few puffs, and lit another.
0:15:7|0:15:12|The third one. He is lying on a leather sofa, holding six cigars in his hands.
0:15:12|0:15:18|Huang Canghai showed off as they started smoking together. However, he was still not satisfied, and opened 6 expensive bottles of foreign liquor in one go, drinking back and forth.
0:15:20|0:15:31|He not only drank, but also sprayed everywhere, in the bedroom, in the pool. After having fun, he casually plucked the rose petals from the vase, threw them into the bathtub, and took a flower petal bath.
0:15:32|0:15:55|On one side, [Huang Canghai] was enjoying himself crazily in the big villa, while on the other side, [Jie Rui] followed the sound of his phone vibrating and found his father's coat, shoes, and phone on the beach. His expression changed, he raised his left hand to cover his face and started crying in pain. Just as he let out a howl, a coconut fell from the sky. He raised his hand and saw his father picking coconuts on a coconut tree.
0:16:5|0:16:19|[Jie Rui] reluctantly lowered his head and quickly reached out to catch the coconut, but his father landed with a thud on the beach.
0:16:37|0:16:46|[Jie Rui] was stunned, [Liang Youde] stood awkwardly in place, then snapped his fingers and started to sing awkwardly.
0:17:22|0:17:29|[Liang Youde] snatched the coconut from his son's arms and walked away.
0:18:4|0:18:11|[Huang Canghai] picked up his phone, turned off the music, and looked at the photo of himself and his ex-girlfriend on the screen, unable to hold back his tears.
0:18:15|0:18:20|After taking a bath, [Huang Canghai] sat on the sofa in a luxurious bathrobe, smoking a cigar and taking selfies.
0:18:21|0:18:35|He held up his phone in his left hand to record a video, while his right hand alternated between touching a metal beast figurine and other decorations. Taking a deep puff of his cigar, he spoke.
0:18:45|0:19:3|[Huang Canghai] strutted in front of the camera, waiting for a reply after sending a video to his ex-girlfriend. However, all he got was an exclamation mark, indicating that she had blocked him. Seeing this, [Huang Canghai] angrily threw his phone to the ground, vigorously rubbed his hair with both hands, his expression fierce, and then he leaned back on the sofa and began to wail.
0:19:3|0:19:17|On the other side, [Jie Rui], who was being hit by his father, returned to his room with a bitter face. He poured a glass of whiskey, and as soon as he put down the bottle, [Li Cha] walked in. Without any hesitation, he picked up the glass and started drinking. [Jie Rui] hurried to snatch it, but he couldn't get it back.
0:19:39|0:19:51|[Jie Rui] nodded at [Li Cha], then made a hugging gesture. [Li Cha] smiled and walked over to hug the other person. [Jie Rui] accidentally kicked [Li Cha] towards the piano, lost balance himself, and almost did the splits.
0:19:51|0:19:53|Passing by the door, [Wang Andi] was startled.
0:20:33|0:20:49|[Wang Andi] brought [Jie Rui] and [Li Cha] to Mrs. Monica's room. When they pushed the door open, they saw a slender figure in a bathrobe with a towel wrapped around their head lying on the bed with their back to them. [Wang Andi] turned his head and slapped [Jie Rui] on the face, leaving him stunned.
0:20:50|0:20:54|The person on the bed slowly sat up and turned around, with a face mask on.
0:20:58|0:21:5|[Wang Andi] hurriedly approached to show goodwill, [Li Cha] also had an expectant smile on his face, only to see the person on the bed turn his head to look at them.
0:21:13|0:21:20|[Li Cha] happily ran over to hug the person on the bed, only to have the person roll over and vomit all over him.
0:21:27|0:21:41|[Wang Andi] hurriedly found an excuse to leave when he saw this, and [Jie Rui] followed him out. Just as [Li Cha] was about to greet the person in his arms, he saw the mask fall off, revealing that he was not [Auntie] at all. This startled [Wang Andi] and [Jie Rui] outside the door.
0:22:57|0:23:7|[Liang Youde] was dragged out by [Jie Rui] before he could see the face of the person in his arms. [Jie Rui] was shocked by his words, and he covered his face and returned to the room to speak to [Huang Canghai].
0:24:27|0:24:34|The three of them left the room and went to the outdoor café to discuss their strategy. Coincidentally, the real Mrs. [Lili] was right behind them.
0:24:36|0:24:42|She was dressed in a tight-fitting dress, exuding elegance from head to toe. She glanced at the waitress in the cafe and walked away with a smile.
0:24:42|0:24:48|[Jie Rui] handed some loose change to [Huang Canghai].
0:25:10|0:25:17|After saying "Li Cha", he gestured with his fingers towards the two people next to him.
0:25:19|0:25:35|They split up immediately, [Li Cha] went to the wholesale market. He stood in front of a small shop selling wigs, smiling broadly. There were many mannequins wearing wigs outside the shop. He walked up and took off all the wigs, even casually taking the wig off a foreigner standing nearby.
0:25:35|0:25:49|[Jie Rui] returned to the hotel alone. He sneaked into the bedroom and found his wife was not there. Quietly, he opened several boxes of cosmetics on the floor and saw piles of lipstick, eyeshadow, and nail polish. He was dumbfounded by the sight.
0:26:3|0:26:14|On the other side, Li Cha, who was folding wigs at the wholesale market, was mistaken for a thief by the security guard and taken away. In front of him were a pile of wigs and a piece of women's underwear. Li Cha squatted in the corner of the wholesale market, crying miserably.
0:26:14|0:26:31|Madam [Lili] and Huang Canghai coincidentally walked into the same laundry room, where neatly arranged clothes hangers were hung with clothes. Soon, Madam [Lili] picked up a maid outfit and walked to the side to change. Just as she took off her fitted suit skirt and placed it on a low rack, it was taken away by Huang Canghai who happened to pass by.
0:26:31|0:26:37|She felt something was wrong and turned around to see a strange man staring blankly at her almost naked body.
0:26:46|0:27:13|Lili used the pole for hanging clothes to poke Huang Canghai's eyes forcefully. Huang Canghai's screams instantly attracted the black security guard at the door. When the guard walked in, he found no one inside the room, only a few pieces of clothing on the floor. He raised his baton and looked around, just about to leave when he heard some movement near the cabinet. The two people hiding in the cabinet immediately panicked. Lili covered Huang Canghai's mouth with one hand and searched for a phone in his pocket with the other hand. The black security guard forcefully opened the cabinet in front of him.
0:27:13|0:27:25|Huang Canghai found only two mannequin models inside. Just as he was puzzled, the cabinet next to him opened automatically. A black security guard approached and saw a man being pinned down by a woman in underwear in the corner, unable to move.
0:27:27|0:27:33|He awkwardly whistled pretending not to see anything, quietly walked out, closed the door, and said a word to the young man with a smile.
0:27:33|0:27:40|After being beaten up, [Huang Canghai] returned to the room prepared for Monica, rubbing his eyes with eggs while listening to [Jie Rui].
0:27:45|0:28:5|[Jie Rui]'s expression suddenly became exaggerated. [Li Cha], with long curly hair on top of his head and carrying a dozen pieces of women's underwear, had a very creepy smile. [Huang Canghai] then found a video of a foreign male beauty blogger and started watching and learning from it.
0:28:5|0:28:13|He first put on a pair of women's stockings on his head, then started trimming his nose hair and patting on aftershave. He applied loose powder, put on eyeshadow, drew eyeliner, and accidentally poked himself in the eye.
0:28:57|0:29:7|[Huang Canghai] practiced speaking while trying on clothes, and finally chose the fitted suit dress he got from Mrs. Monica.
0:29:13|0:29:19|The banquet proceeded as scheduled, and [Lulu] couldn't help but sigh as she looked at her wedding photo.
0:29:23|0:29:33|Lulu, who was originally frowning, immediately smiled when she saw her friend. Jie Rui walked up to the stage and, glancing at Li Cha beside him, began to speak.
0:29:44|0:30:8|The scene was filled with thunderous applause, everyone turned around to look back. A person in a tight-fitting suit dress, with medium-length curly hair and holding a folding fan, was sitting on a very extravagant platform, teasing and charming everyone. This person was none other than [Huang Canghai] disguised as Mrs. Monica. The people at the party looked at him with smiles on their faces, but suddenly the person on the sign lost balance and fell down, leaving everyone stunned.
0:30:8|0:30:13|[Li Cha] couldn't help but burst into laughter, then quickly ran over to help [Huang Canghai].
0:30:15|0:30:20|[Huang Canghai] holds onto the dining table with a pained expression, [Wang Andi] quickly steps forward to offer assistance.
0:31:51|0:31:57|The whole group raised their glasses, [Wang Andi] took a sip of champagne and spoke again.
0:32:18|0:32:33|Huang Canghai, disguised as Mrs. Monica, was pushed onto the stage by Liang Youde. Everyone watched eagerly as Huang Canghai stood on the stage without saying a word for a long time.
0:32:46|0:32:55|After [Huang Canghai] finished speaking, he covered his face with a fan, leaving everyone stunned.
0:33:24|0:33:34|At the banquet, the scene was lively with glasses clinking, but the real Mrs. Monica had changed into a maid outfit and was walking towards the banquet hall. Just as she was about to turn the corner, she bumped into Fatso and Tall Skinny.
0:33:49|0:34:17|The tall and thin person stood in place grinning foolishly, while the chubby person sneered and put on sunglasses before walking forward. The scene then cuts back to the banquet hall, where Monica, dressed as a maid, slowly walks in. She casually picks up a glass of red wine and thanks the waiter, then looks around and sees Li Cha. Suddenly, the manager of the hall hands Monica a bunch of wine glasses and asks her to take them to the kitchen.
0:34:27|0:34:36|[Lulu] stepped forward and hugged [Huang Canghai], giving him two pecks on the cheek. [Huang Canghai]'s smile looked a bit awkward. Seeing this, [Li Cha] became anxious in an instant. [Jie Rui] quickly comforted him.
0:34:38|0:34:46|[Huang Canghai] suddenly leaned in and kissed [Lulu], leaving two big lip prints on each other's faces. [Li Cha] was furious and picked up the ball on the ground, ready to throw it.
0:36:1|0:36:8|[Wang Andi] and [Liang Youde] started arguing on the spot, [Huang Canghai] took the opportunity to walk away, [Jie Rui] hurriedly stepped forward to pull his father-in-law aside.
0:36:18|0:36:33|[Wang Andi] was choked by [Jie Rui]'s words, and could only walk away while feeling upset. Meanwhile, [Huang Canghai] was using Mrs. Monica's fake identity to kiss other ladies at the banquet, when suddenly [Liang Youde] approached and startled him.
0:37:28|0:37:34|And [Li Cha] was eating heartily when the real Mrs. Monica walked over to greet him, and he pointed to the dim sum.
0:37:44|0:37:53|[Li Cha] talked while chewing snacks, spraying food crumbs all over [Wang Andi]. Monica quickly handed [Li Cha] a glass of orange juice, and [Li Cha] took a sip to smooth things over.
0:38:21|0:38:32|[Wang Andi] left satisfied, and Monica smiled with relief. [Li Cha] took out a diamond ring and placed it on the pastry, then covered it with strawberry crumbs as a disguise.
0:38:32|0:38:35|He gestured to Monica to keep quiet, while Monica cheered him on from the sidelines.
0:38:59|0:39:6|[Li Cha] raised his right hand forcefully, and the people in the hall suddenly froze, then moved according to his thoughts.
0:39:15|0:39:46|[Li Cha] fantasized that [Lulu] bit the ring, then raised it up and asked in confusion. Everyone at the party gathered around, then turned their heads to look in the same direction. They saw [Li Cha] sitting at the piano in the corner, playing passionately. He had a rose in his mouth, with two accompanying musicians standing beside him. The music suddenly stopped, [Li Cha] slowly stood up, took the rose out of his mouth and threw it back, saying as he walked up to [Lulu] and took the ring from her hand before stepping back.
0:39:59|0:40:8|[Li Cha] stood up and put a ring on [Lulu], everyone took out silk to celebrate. [Huang Canghai] danced awkwardly in the crowd, then suddenly raised his hand and shouted to stop.
0:40:17|0:40:23|[Huang Canghai] raised his fan and talked about his thoughts.
0:40:28|0:40:42|[Lulu] took out a ring from her mouth and held it up, asking everyone to gather around again. She turned her head to the corner, and [Li Cha] walked up to [Lulu] with a sentimental song, took the ring and knelt down to propose.
0:41:11|0:41:25|Everyone cheered for the promotion and raise of [Huang Canghai], and the awkward dance mode was activated again on the scene. Just then, [Jie Rui] suddenly raised his hand and shouted to interrupt [Huang Canghai]'s fantasy.
0:41:45|0:41:52|[Li Cha] quickly ran to [Lulu]'s side, the two of them happily embraced each other, and the crowd cheered and applauded again. Suddenly, [Jie Rui] shouted,
0:42:20|0:42:32|[Jie Rui] stood in the center of the crowd, [Lili] knelt at his feet apologizing, and [Wang Andi] handed over the company to him. [Jie Rui] happily reported the good news to his father, but just as the three of them were immersed in their fantasies and silly laughter, a male waiter suddenly interrupted them.
0:42:52|0:43:5|[Huang Canghai]'s butt was pinched. They hid behind the backdrop and suddenly saw the dessert with a diamond ring being held by [Lili], ready to eat. [Li Cha] hurried over to stop her, grabbing [Lili]'s hand to prevent her from eating it.
0:44:9|0:44:20|Huang Canghai, who was hiding behind, was getting anxious. He knocked over a few people fighting for the dim sum. The ring inside flew out and spun a few times before dropping to the ground. Huang Canghai stepped forward, stepped on the ring, and smiled as he spoke.
0:44:28|0:44:45|Li Cha hurriedly bent down to pick up the ring, kneeling on one knee and looking somewhat awkwardly at Lulu. Monica walked out with some snacks and happened to see this scene. Everyone was waiting for Lulu's response, and Wang Andi quickly signaled to his daughter.
0:45:33|0:45:38|Just as everyone was laughing and joking, Mrs. Monica suddenly walked onto the stage, while [Huang Canghai] was asking for a reward in front of [Jie Rui].
0:45:54|0:46:2|[Huang Canghai] turned around and shouted while pinching his throat, causing Mrs. Monica to freeze instantly, with her smile frozen on her face.
0:46:12|0:46:25|The fat man suddenly ran in. Mr. Huang Canghai and Jie Rui finally met, their eyes met, and the atmosphere was very awkward.
0:46:27|0:46:33|The previous male waiter walked over, and [Huang Canghai] awkwardly took the coconut shell.
0:46:35|0:46:42|[Huang Canghai] didn't say a word, he just ran out.
0:46:49|0:46:54|[Jie Rui] and [Li Cha] hurried to chase after [Huang Canghai], with [Wang Andi] following closely behind. [Huang Canghai] was wearing high heels.
0:47:4|0:47:14|He complained while taking off his clothes, completely unaware that [Liang Youde] followed him into the room. [Huang Canghai] quickly closed the door to the bathroom.
0:48:1|0:48:19|[Huang Canghai] ignored the voice outside the door, changed into a shirt and trousers, and opened the back door to run to the backyard. He ran to the wall and looked up, then urgently climbed up the ladder brought from the corner of the wall. However, he accidentally fell down while flipping over. On the other side, Monica changed into a maid's uniform.
0:48:34|0:48:40|Seeing Monica about to leave, Huang Canghai panicked instantly. He called out to Monica and hurriedly approached her, trying to apologize.
0:48:51|0:48:59|Monica watched as Fatty walked away, then she straightened her sleeves and headed towards the residential area. As she looked up, she saw someone running frantically.
0:49:36|0:49:43|[Huang Canghai] suddenly gained confidence after hearing this.
0:50:12|0:50:20|Outside the bathroom, Liang Youde and Wang Andi argued incessantly. Inside the bathroom, Huang Canghai hurriedly changed back into the previous dress, put on a wig, and applied makeup.
0:50:28|0:50:34|As soon as the words fell, [Huang Canghai] disguised as Mrs. Monica walked out, smiling as he glanced at the real Monica.
0:51:0|0:51:8|[Huang Canghai] and [Jie Rui] exchanged a few words in a low voice before quickly parting ways. [Jie Rui] then returned to his room, and as he walked out, he picked up his phone to make a call to his subordinate.
0:51:42|0:51:56|[Wang Andi] snatched the wine glass from [Jie Rui], took a sip and walked away. [Jie Rui] wiped his face in despair, unsure of what to do. Meanwhile, Monica looked at [Huang Canghai] on the sofa and spoke.
0:52:1|0:52:6|[Huang Canghai] almost let slip, he hesitated for a moment as he looked at Monica, and then started talking nonsense.
0:52:24|0:52:34|Monica was startled and quickly bent down to thank [Huang Canghai], looking him up and down.
0:53:13|0:53:28|[Huang Canghai], who was dancing with excitement, glanced at Monica sitting on the sofa and suddenly realized that something was wrong.
0:53:33|0:53:48|The two quickly switched positions, with [Huang Canghai] sitting on the sofa and driving Monica out. Seeing Monica leave, [Huang Canghai] hurriedly took out his phone to answer the call.
0:53:57|0:54:2|The scene then shifts to the beach, where Jie Rui is acting cute next to his wife.
0:54:20|0:54:42|[Lili] turned around and lay on the lounge chair, while [Jie Rui] squeezed sunscreen on his hand and sweet-talked. As he lifted his head, he was immediately attracted by two beautiful women. He winked, but was startled by the sudden appearance of [Huang Canghai]. Without looking back, [Lili] said, and after a while of silence, she turned her head to find that [Jie Rui] had disappeared.
0:54:42|0:54:49|Huang Canghai questions Jie Rui nearby.
0:54:59|0:55:16|[Jie Rui] tightly embraces [Huang Canghai], who struggles desperately. The scene of the two pulling and tugging catches the attention of [Lili], who came looking for her husband. Angered, she turns and walks away. Feeling torn, [Jie Rui] decides to first chase after [Huang Canghai].
0:55:42|0:55:48|[Jie Rui] pretended to be weak while making a kneeling gesture.
0:56:2|0:56:22|[Huang Canghai] left in a huff, then he returned alone to Mrs. Monica's residence. There, he saw [Wang Andi] sitting at the table drinking and smoking a cigar. [Huang Canghai] stood behind a beam, peeked inside, took a deep breath, patted his chest, fixed his hair, and then pretended to make a phone call as he walked into the room.
0:57:5|0:57:11|[Huang Canghai] ended the call with a blown kiss, then picked up a small bottle of wine.
0:57:17|0:57:22|[Huang Canghai] gave [Wang Andi] a few glances, then pretended to be shy and ran out.
0:57:22|0:57:29|[Wang Andi] hesitated for a moment, then took out his phone to make a call, while [Huang Canghai] hid behind the beam, smiling as he answered.
0:57:39|0:58:4|[Wang Andi] was walking out while talking, [Huang Canghai] was instantly happy. However, he realized suddenly that the distance from his current location to [Wang Andi]'s residence was 1.7 kilometers. He felt a bit overwhelmed, regret written all over his face. [Huang Canghai] turned around and ran out, but after a few steps, he sensed something was wrong. He took a few steps back and saw [Liang Youde] in the mirror.
0:58:34|0:58:46|[Huang Canghai] tied [Liang Youde]'s eyes with a scarf, then dashed towards the bathroom. He quickly took off his wig, removed his makeup, and stripped off his clothes. He ran to the backyard, climbed a ladder, and jumped over the wall outside.
0:58:46|0:59:1|At the moment he climbed over the wall, the cable car that [Wang Andi] was riding on happened to pass by on the nearby path. The cable car was moving fast, so [Huang Canghai] had to take the small path to reach the destination earlier. At some points, he even had to swing across using the branches of banyan trees, which was very difficult.
0:59:1|0:59:11|Not far away on the beach, [Li Cha] follows [Lulu] and tries to impress her.
0:59:16|0:59:23|[Lulu] rolled her eyes and walked in the opposite direction, while [Huang Canghai] ran halfway and found a little girl had placed her bicycle on the ground in front of him.
0:59:23|0:59:36|He ran over, picked up the bike and rode forward. Taking a shortcut, he arrived at the gate just a second before the cable car that Wang Andi was riding in. Wang Andi walked towards Huang Canghai holding a large bottle of wine.
0:59:43|0:59:52|[Huang Canghai] opened the door and [Wang Andi] looked up. The room was still messy. [Huang Canghai] then turned around and said seriously.
1:0:13|1:0:18|[Huang Canghai] put Wang Andi's clothes aside and sat down.
1:0:57|1:1:1|[Huang Canghai] watched as [Wang Andi] told lies, but could only pretend to cry.
1:1:1|1:1:6|[Wang Andi] stood up immediately, with one hand in his pocket and the other hand making a phone call.
1:1:44|1:1:48|[Huang Canghai] smiled as he put [Wang Andi] into the car, then his expression suddenly changed.
1:1:54|1:2:1|After saying that, he ran back with all his might, hopped on the bike he picked up, and rushed back. Soon, he was stopped by the little owner of the bike and her mother.
1:2:3|1:2:19|On the beach, [Lulu] was completely fed up with [Li Cha]. [Lulu] pointed towards the sea, [Li Cha] turned to look, then stuck the parasol into the ground, handed the coconut to [Lulu], and casually put the sun hat on [Lulu]'s head.
1:2:27|1:2:34|Jie Rui is still explaining to his wife what just happened, while not far away, Huang Canghai has already returned outside the wall and climbed into the backyard.
1:2:34|1:2:42|He rushed into the bathroom from the back door and made some moves, then changed back to the appearance of Mrs. Monica. He left the bathroom and sneakily looked outside, finding no one there.
1:2:43|1:2:49|He had just taken a step when he found the floor covered with potato chips, [Liang Youde] was lying on the sofa, holding a bottle of liquor and eating potato chips.
1:3:31|1:3:36|[Huang Canghai] pushes [Liang Youde] into the bedroom, then walks out to greet [Wang Andi].
1:3:36|1:3:52|[Liang Youde] suddenly appeared, both [Wang Andi] and [Liang Youde] were startled. After roaring, [Huang Canghai] quickly changed his attitude, and [Wang Andi] and [Liang Youde] obediently turned around.
1:4:6|1:4:13|[Huang Canghai] took the small gift from [Liang Youde]'s hand, pushed him into the room, then sighed and slowly walked over to [Wang Andi].
1:4:48|1:4:54|[Huang Canghai] waved the small gift in his hand as he spoke, prompting [Wang Andi] to reach out and take it.
1:5:2|1:5:18|[Wang Andi] put away the small gift, took out his phone and started making a call, while [Huang Canghai] was chuckling. Suddenly, the phone vibrated, and he quickly realized it was his phone. He sneakily answered the call.
1:5:41|1:5:55|[Lili] was lying on the lounge chair, with [Jie Rui] grinning beside her. Shortly after [Lili] lay down, she suddenly turned her head back and looked, without saying a word. [Jie Rui], on the other hand, seemed somewhat pleased.
1:6:5|1:6:16|[Huang Canghai] sneaked into the bedroom with [Jie Rui], but [Liang Youde] didn't respond, suddenly rushing out from behind the screen.
1:6:26|1:6:37|Lili suddenly rushed in, she looked at the fake Monica lying on the bed, as well as Liang Youde and Jie Rui on top of him, and left angrily.
1:6:45|1:6:52|[Huang Canghai] grabbed the decoration at the head of the bed and smashed it towards [Liang Youde].
1:6:55|1:7:10|Liang Youde fell to the side, Huang Canghai breathed a sigh of relief, quickly got up and ran outside. He closed the door and ran out in Mrs. Monica's disguise, struggling to climb the ladder in high heels, and then fell off the wall.
1:7:11|1:7:28|On the other side, Wang Andi returned to the residence and called out for Huang Canghai. As soon as he entered the house, Huang Canghai rushed to the door, panting heavily. Just as he finished speaking, Huang Canghai suddenly realized he had forgotten to change his clothes.
1:7:46|1:7:53|[Huang Canghai] stood up wearing almost transparent underwear, and quickly reached down to cover himself when he looked down.
1:8:10|1:8:15|[Huang Canghai] was instantly excited.
1:8:30|1:8:36|Huang Canghai's smile froze on his face instantly as he sat on the cable car with Wang Andi, both wrapped in towels. Wang Andi kept staring at him.
1:8:50|1:8:56|The young man fastened his seatbelt, put on sunglasses and gloves, stepped on the gas pedal, and the engine made a buzzing sound. [Huang Canghai] asked helplessly.
1:9:16|1:9:23|[Wang Andi] opened the box of the small gift, took a quick look, and then hurriedly closed it.
1:9:24|1:9:32|The cable car slowly stopped at the intersection, and the driver turned around and said,
1:9:42|1:9:58|He turned around and found that [Huang Canghai] had disappeared. He could only sigh helplessly. He walked into the room alone and found no one there. He continued to walk inside. Meanwhile, [Huang Canghai] had already returned to the bathroom. He was wrapped in a towel around his lower body, standing in front of the mirror putting on a wig.
1:10:0|1:10:15|The door creaked open, and [Wang Andi] walked in. [Huang Canghai], who was already in the bath, looked up from his bath. [Wang Andi] tossed his laptop aside and spoke.
1:10:16|1:10:30|[Wang Andi] opened the box of the small gift, inside were condoms. [Lili] walked in aggressively with [Lulu].
1:10:39|1:10:55|Bubbles suddenly rose in the bath, and [Huang Canghai] picked up a bottle of wine and smashed it into the water.
1:10:59|1:11:23|A person suddenly emerged from the water, and that person was [Wang Andi]. He sat up awkwardly and smiled at his two daughters. [Lulu] stood still in shock, while [Lili] completely lost it and angrily ran away. [Huang Canghai] then cleared his throat and asked, leaving Lulu dumbfounded for a while. The sunlight outside was just right, and Lulu eventually revealed the truth.
1:11:23|1:11:30|Although she didn't know that the woman in front of her was actually [Huang Canghai] disguised as Mrs. Monica.
1:11:38|1:11:44|At this moment, [Li Cha] is trapped on the sea surface, sitting on a motorboat without fuel.
1:11:51|1:12:19|Upon learning the truth, [Huang Canghai] sat by the broken boat at the seaside in a daze. He sighed as he thought about his past, quietly took out his phone and composed a message: "Mom, the company has gone bankrupt, may not be able to take you on vacation."
1:12:20|1:12:27|On the other side, [Lili] arrived at the seaside with makeup smeared from crying.
1:12:29|1:12:44|A splash is heard, and [Lili] disappears from the screen. Beside the wrecked boat, [Huang Canghai] hesitates for a moment. After some contemplation, he picks up his phone, deletes the previously edited text, and then types a new message to send out. The content reads:
1:12:49|1:13:9|[Huang Canghai] was stunned for a moment, then suddenly turned around and shouted at the young man playing the guitar behind him. The scene then shifted to the bar, where [Wang Andi] was sitting alone at the bar drinking heavily.
1:13:42|1:14:3|The bartender pushed the drink forward and answered seriously, [Wang Andi] smiled and nodded at him. He handed a banknote to the bartender, and [Wang Andi] gestured towards him. The bartender looked a bit puzzled.
1:14:18|1:14:27|[Huang Canghai] is wearing women's makeup and a wig, with a towel wrapped around the lower body. With all his might, he is dragging the broken boat to the side.
1:14:27|1:14:36|Monica suddenly appeared at this moment.
1:15:9|1:15:15|In a flash, [Huang Canghai] suddenly appeared with disheveled hair, a swollen nose, and blood dripping from his nose.
1:15:48|1:15:55|Monica turned her head and glared at [Huang Canghai], who immediately backed down.
1:16:2|1:16:18|[Huang Canghai] started to make fun of himself, and Monica looked at him with some tenderness. As soon as he finished speaking, [Huang Canghai] followed Monica to the bar and quickly downed several glasses of beer.
1:16:33|1:16:39|[Huang Canghai] fell directly to the ground, and Monica hurried to help him up.
1:16:57|1:17:5|Xia Xi was sitting right behind [Huang Canghai], who turned around to look at his ex-girlfriend. In that instant, he sobered up and threw away his phone.
1:17:14|1:17:29|Huang Canghai's smile disappeared instantly. Xiaoxi waved her hand, and a tall and handsome foreign man walked in. Huang Canghai and Monica were both stunned. The next second, the foreign man stepped aside, and a short, fat, bald middle-aged ugly man walked over.
1:17:37|1:17:44|[Huang Canghai] sneered and reached out his hand towards the ugly man, who brushed past him and rubbed the corner of his eye.
1:18:42|1:18:51|[Huang Canghai] chuckled at Monica's back and quickly followed her. They then returned to the broken ship together, where Monica spoke.
1:18:53|1:18:59|[Huang Canghai] took a few quick steps and retrieved two cans of beer from the broken ship cabin.
1:19:2|1:19:13|He handed the beer to Monica, then forcefully moved the small boat blocking the door of the broken ship, and proudly ran to the door, where Monica walked over and said.
1:19:23|1:19:39|[Huang Canghai] carefully helped [Monica] block her head. [Monica] looked around the cabin, which was small but well-equipped with a desk, hammock, and food. She took out a book and sat on the hammock to read.
1:19:39|1:19:43|As the sky darkened, [Huang Canghai] began to talk about his own story.
1:20:12|1:20:19|[Huang Canghai] angrily took a sip of beer, while [Monica] remained silent and also took a sip.
1:20:35|1:20:41|Monica was amused by him and replied helplessly.
1:21:23|1:21:41|Night falls, [Lulu] sits in a small wooden boat, propping up her head, while [Li Cha] sits opposite, arranging the word LOVE with candles on a wooden frame.
1:22:37|1:22:48|The sky suddenly flashed with lightning and thunder. [Lili], who had jumped into the sea earlier, suddenly emerged from the water. The scene then switched to [Liang Youde] pouring some powder into a bottle of liquor.
1:23:19|1:23:25|The bartender walked away with a look of grievance on his face.
1:23:31|1:23:38|One person left while the other stayed behind, leaving the drugged drink just sitting there.
1:23:40|1:23:54|[Lulu] walked to the bar, picked up the bottle of drugged wine and an empty glass, poured the wine and walked into the room. She casually placed the bottle on the piano, carried the glass and walked in. At the same time, [Jie Rui] received the message and ran over.
1:24:3|1:24:9|[Huang Canghai] and [Monica] also walked in, and [Huang Canghai] happened to see the bottle of wine on the piano.
1:24:11|1:24:25|[Huang Canghai] walked into the room opposite to Lulu with a glass of wine, accompanied by Monica. Lulu kicked out [Li Cha] and [Jie Rui], and threw their coats out as well.
1:24:25|1:24:32|[Li Cha] looked puzzled, [Jie Rui] was also confused. [Li Cha] threw his coat aside, bent down and started washing his face in the small fountain nearby.
1:24:32|1:24:50|[Jie Rui] started washing his feet across the room, [Li Cha] was stunned when he looked up. [Jie Rui] quickly took his feet out and started washing his face, while [Li Cha] began washing his feet. [Lili] curled up on the sofa with disheveled hair, took a sip from the wine glass.
1:25:20|1:25:26|After Lulu finished speaking, she directly drank the wine that her sister hadn't finished, while the two people in the opposite room were also drinking.
1:25:42|1:25:50|Liang Youde was drunk by Wang Andi in the bar.
1:25:51|1:25:58|[Wang Andi] patted [Liang Youde]'s face and then left. As soon as [Wang Andi] left, the drunken [Liang Youde] opened his eyes.
1:26:18|1:26:25|Li Cha sat in front of the piano and nodded at Lulu.
1:26:49|1:26:57|In the flash of lightning, a figure passed by. [Jie Rui] was scared to death, but as he slowly turned around, he suddenly felt a spark - his wife was right behind him.
1:27:35|1:28:6|In the room across, [Monica] was holding hands with [Huang Canghai], and the two locked eyes. [Li Cha] still maintained the posture of being pressed on the piano by [Lulu]. Suddenly, a scene of [Li Cha] alone swimming to the island flashed on the screen. He climbed onto the island, took off the life jacket and threw it aside, then crawled towards the center of the island. [Lulu] wanted to say something but was interrupted by [Li Cha].
1:28:20|1:28:26|[Lulu] seems to be touched, she reaches out and takes this special flower.
1:28:29|1:28:44|Outside the house, lightning and thunder, while inside the house, the three pairs of men and women seemed to be making some noise. [Lulu] pressed [Li Cha] against the piano, [Lili] tied a rope around [Jie Rui]'s neck, [Monica] and [Huang Canghai] locked eyes, while outside, [Wang Andi] and [Liang Youde] met in the pouring rain.
1:29:17|1:29:25|[Wang Andi] was leaning against the glass window in front of him, looking down, when suddenly his expression froze.
1:29:35|1:29:44|Monica was seen leaning against the bedside with a glass of wine, while Huang Canghai once again dressed as a woman, wearing a very sexy backless dress, dancing in the room.
1:29:44|1:29:50|Monica lay on the bed and beckoned to him. He knelt down and crawled towards her step by step.
1:29:50|1:29:57|On the rooftop, [Wang Andi] and [Liang Youde] who were peeking were completely shocked. Meanwhile, in the other room, [Jie Rui] was tied up by his wife with a rope.
1:29:58|1:30:8|He was completely tied up like a crab, unable to move. [Lili] stood by looking very happy, while [Li Cha], who had been pressed against the piano, was now lying on the ground.
1:30:8|1:30:20|He struggled desperately to say something, but before he could say a few words, he was dragged back by [Lulu], and the flower he made with leaves was placed on the edge of the piano.
1:30:20|1:30:25|After a while, the buds that were originally closed began to gradually bloom.
1:30:25|1:30:44|The next morning, the outdoor sunlight was just right, the sea breeze was gentle, and the waves were calm. [Jie Rui] stood bare-armed in front of the window, smiling as he pulled open the curtains, took off the rope around his neck, and then cheerfully lit a cigar. Just as he was about to take a puff, he was grabbed by the hair and pulled down by [Lili].
1:30:44|1:30:54|She glanced back at her husband, smiled, and pulled the curtains closed. Outside, [Li Cha] lay on the ground next to the piano with his clothes open, hands behind his head, his face covered in lipstick marks.
1:31:2|1:31:12|Lulu massaged Li Cha's legs while asking questions. Li Cha shook his head playfully, but his face was full of smiles. In another room, Monica woke up from her sleep.
1:31:12|1:31:16|She found her hands tied to the head of the bed, and her body was also bound with a blanket.
1:31:20|1:31:26|Monica looked down and found the other person sleeping at her feet. She looked at [Huang Canghai] and asked sternly.
1:31:40|1:31:56|The scene flashes back to the stormy night yesterday, with lightning and thunder, [Huang Canghai] lying in a bathtub filled with petals and ice cubes in the disguise of Mrs. Monica, [Jie Rui] shivering.
1:32:12|1:32:18|[Huang Canghai] crawled from the foot of the bed to the head, turned over and lay on Monica's arm with his eyes closed. Monica looked at him and said.
1:32:28|1:32:38|Everyone rushed out and saw [Liang Youde] standing outside the railing of the tall building.
1:35:9|1:35:18|[Jie Rui] stood aside and whispered to the priest for help.
1:35:44|1:35:52|The wedding officially begins, with smiles on everyone's faces. The guests applaud and cheer happily.
1:35:52|1:36:0|Only [Huang Canghai], dressed in a wedding gown, showed no sign of joy on his face. He walked through the crowd expressionless, then silently went up on stage to stand beside the priest.
1:36:0|1:36:6|Monica in the audience looked a bit helpless, while on stage, [Huang Canghai] stood with his hands crossed at his waist, saying nothing.
1:36:6|1:36:13|The priest glanced at him, forced a smile, and raised the horn, saying.
1:36:26|1:36:32|The priest suddenly paused and then continued speaking.
1:36:52|1:36:59|The priest glanced at the big golden retriever in the audience and remained silent for a while.
1:37:25|1:37:31|The priest put down the horn and turned around to ask.
1:38:0|1:38:9|[Huang Canghai] did not immediately respond to the priest's words, but stood in place taking a few deep breaths before answering loudly.
1:38:39|1:38:46|[Liang Youde] is a bit embarrassed, and [Wang Andi] has nothing to say.
1:38:54|1:39:2|The people in the audience were all stunned by his words, only [Li Cha] was holding up his phone and recording a video.
1:39:19|1:39:27|[Huang Canghai]'s words shocked everyone, and [Lili] in the audience seemed to be moved as well. She had a look of admiration on her face as she stared intently at [Huang Canghai].
1:40:13|1:40:32|Lili watched as Huang Canghai's smile on stage grew bigger and bigger. The three of them hurried upstairs to stop their father.
1:40:32|1:40:38|Xia Xi's fiancé suddenly started to applaud.
1:40:57|1:41:2|The scene suddenly became chaotic, even the foreigner holding a child joined in the excitement.
1:41:5|1:41:14|Just as everyone was arguing, [Huang Canghai] suddenly rode off on a jet ski, causing the arguing men to quickly disperse and then start chasing after him.
1:41:14|1:41:21|Upstairs, [Wang Andi] and [Liang Youde] leaned against the railing, turned to look at each other, then climbed over the railing together to chase after.
1:41:21|1:41:23|The sea suddenly became very lively.
1:41:23|1:41:42|[Huang Canghai] is wearing a wedding dress and speeding on a speedboat, with a group of men on a yacht chasing after him. [Huang Canghai] stops the speedboat at the shore, lifts his skirt and runs wildly. He runs across the lawn, across the square, and then across the long tree-lined path. The men persistently chase after him, trying to block each other while chasing.
1:41:42|1:41:56|You push me, I block you, one person falls down, another person rolls on the ground, but no one stops, they are like a group of hungry wild beasts seeing fat meat, pushing and shoving each other like gorillas.
1:41:56|1:42:15|[Huang Canghai] was starting to run out of breath, he bent over panting with his skirt in hand, and as soon as he turned around, he saw the wolves behind him. He turned and ran towards the stairs next to the overpass, where a dangerous sign was erected on the bridge. Beside it, a staff member with headphones was sitting in a chair, head down playing on their phone. [Huang Canghai] didn't hesitate, and continued running towards the center of the bridge.
1:42:15|1:42:35|The men also ran forward, with [Huang Canghai] standing at the edge of the bridge looking down. The hundreds of meters of height made him a little dizzy. He patted his chest and took a few steps forward, only to find a huge hole on the bridge ahead. [Huang Canghai] stood at the edge of the bridge waving and shouting desperately.
1:42:49|1:42:55|[Huang Canghai] hadn't even steadied himself before falling through the hole.
1:42:55|1:43:2|The people on the bridge looked down and happened to see [Huang Canghai] hanging on a piece of cloth.
1:43:22|1:43:55|At such a critical moment, the people on the bridge were still fighting for survival. The cloth strip that [Huang Canghai] was holding onto could no longer hold on, and he fell from hundreds of meters high into the water. The opening scene of the film appeared, showing the man in a wedding dress [Huang Canghai] sinking into the deep sea along with a 20-dollar bill.
1:44:24|1:44:34|The event was a kind of relief for him, and the international media reported extensively on the death of [Huang Canghai], also known as the woman everyone thought was Mrs. Monica.
1:44:34|1:44:51|On the tombstone is a black and white photo of [Huang Canghai] in women's clothing, with Monica's English name and the date 19-2018 September 30 engraved below. Not far away stands a statue built in the likeness of [Huang Canghai], with a $20 bill in its hand.
1:44:51|1:45:0|In front of the tombstone, the priest is bending down to offer flowers, while many people in mourning clothes are bowing their heads in silence. At the end of the crowd, [Wang Andi] reaches out and pats [Liang Youde] on the shoulder, and the two of them then leave together.
1:45:0|1:45:4|The scene then shifts to the hospital, where a person with a breathing machine and bandages wrapped around their head is lying on a hospital bed.
1:45:18|1:45:26|Just then, [Huang Canghai] suddenly walked over with his arms crossed, he sighed as he looked at the fat man on the bed.
1:45:49|1:45:55|Monica finished speaking and then walked out.
