0:4:44|0:4:53|Watching the massive demonstration procession, the reactionary troops stationed at the Baoshan intersection appeared extremely cold-blooded. At the moment when the crowd broke through the barricades,
0:4:53|0:5:2|The officer fired into the sky, causing the reactionary soldiers behind the sandbags to pull the trigger, and in an instant, countless bullets flew out.
0:5:2|0:5:13|The deafening and continuous gunfire echoed throughout the entire city of Shanghai. In just a moment, the civilians who didn't have time to take cover fell like grass being cut down in swathes.
0:5:13|0:5:23|In the darkness, wisps of flames lingered, and a flash of lightning revealed the mottled four characters, "The Founding of an Army," emerging from the depths of the flames.
0:5:23|0:5:33|The movie officially begins. On the eve of the 412 coup, a car hurriedly drove towards the Catholic church on Baoshan Road in Jing'an District, Shanghai. At this moment,
0:5:33|0:5:41|This place has been requisitioned as the headquarters of the 2nd Division of the 26th Army of the National Revolutionary Army. A middle-aged man in a suit and leather shoes stepped out of the sedan.
0:5:41|0:5:48|He is [Zhou Enlai], who was the 29-year-old overall commander of the Shanghai Workers' Armed Uprising at that time.
0:5:54|0:6:1|Outside the headquarters, more than a hundred armed soldiers are on guard duty.
0:6:1|0:6:12|The responding officer is named Si Li, the younger brother of the Second Division commander Si Lie. [Zhou Enlai] once served as the director of the political department of the Whampoa Military Academy, where the commander studied, hence the respectful address as teacher.
0:6:12|0:6:19|The scene shifts to the Huageluo Mansion, where a young man is welcomed down from a sedan by a guard in a suit.
0:6:24|0:6:33|The young man full of arrogance is none other than [Wang Shouhua], who was then the acting chairman of the Shanghai General Workers' District. On this day, he was invited by the leader of the Green Gang, [Du Yuesheng], to discuss matters at the Du family mansion.
0:6:33|0:6:43|Meanwhile, in the Commercial Press located in Zhabei District, workers were busy at work, printing out notices one after another, neatly arranging them on the table. The paper read:
0:6:43|0:6:52|While the workers were busy and focused, little did they know that danger was silently approaching them at this moment.
0:6:52|0:7:9|In the narrow streets and alleys, a group of ten men in black gathered and surged into the main street, glaring at the militiamen guarding outside the bookstore. Similar scenes were repeated outside the headquarters of various worker picket teams in the Shanghai urban area, with numerous trucks patrolling the main roads.
0:7:9|0:7:15|The scene returns to inside the Catholic church.
0:7:40|0:7:44|The speaker is [Zhou Enlai], along with the commander of the Second Division of the Twenty-Sixth Army.
0:7:44|0:7:53|With Stirling shaking his head in denial, the scene shifts to the misty city of Nanjing. Inside a luxurious building, a middle-aged man leans against a table.
0:7:53|0:8:1|Looking out at the flashing lightning outside the window, it was as chaotic as the rain in Nanjing. In Shanghai, the once lively scene of singing and dancing had changed, with large numbers of soldiers and police disarming.
0:8:1|0:8:8|Detained workers' picket teams everywhere.
0:8:10|0:8:16|In the mansion, [Du Yuesheng] ignored [Wang Shouhua] and simply peeled the fruit in his hand.
0:8:18|0:8:25|He spoke slowly. After that, he placed the pear in front of [Wang Shouhua].
0:8:27|0:8:32|[Du Yuesheng] returned the pear to [Wang Shouhua].
0:9:22|0:9:29|Du Yuesheng picked up the yellow wine and handed it over after speaking.
0:9:29|0:9:33|[Wang Shouhua] remained aloof and did not respond, leaving him hanging on the side.
0:9:33|0:9:45|[Du Yuesheng]'s face turned cold and uniform, he raised his hand with a gesture of mercy, and the yellow wine in the cup spilled down. Immediately, three guards in the room stepped forward, two of them restrained [Wang Shouhua].
0:9:45|0:9:56|He was motionless. One person grabbed his throat and ruthlessly stabbed a small knife into his neck, blood gushing out at that moment, his life slowly fading away, and the death of [Wang Shouhua] also revealed the 412 coup.
0:9:56|0:9:57|The opening scene.
0:9:57|0:10:21|In the chaotic streets of Shanghai, reactionary soldiers and police are arresting Communist Party members and progressive workers with impunity. They are either physically assaulted or subjected to brutal interrogations, and countless compatriots are being shot on the spot, with no regard for human rights or humanity. In a moment, the white terror spreads throughout the entire city of Shanghai, engulfing the innocent in the midst of the chaotic gunfire.
0:10:21|0:10:32|The cries of the Shanghai people filled the air, lingering for a long time. Amidst the chaos and killings in the city, [Zhou Enlai] inside the Catholic church was also under tight control.
0:10:32|0:10:37|Counter-revolutionary soldiers emerged from all corners, surrounding [Zhou Enlai] with firearms in hand.
0:10:37|0:10:44|On the Huangpu River, a large warship slowly moves forward, with thick smoke billowing from its tall smokestacks.
0:10:44|0:11:6|With a burst of gunfire, the turret at the bow of the ship twisted its steel body, aimed at the coordinates, and then, a huge flame erupted from the barrel, followed by a roaring cannonball that flew towards the bustling city of Shanghai on the opposite bank. It tore through the air, ripping apart the peaceful facade of Shanghai, and the cannonball accurately hit the Commercial Press.
0:11:6|0:11:31|The deafening explosion rang out, and the windows of the bookstore facing the street burst into a blazing fire. Countless bricks and wood chips were thrown into the air, and the dust and smoke billowed through the streets and alleys. The massive shockwave knocked the workers inside the building to the ground, and for a moment, the scorching fire consumed all the air in the building, making it difficult to breathe.
0:11:31|0:11:39|The paper and ink in the printing house were engulfed by flames, burning incessantly. Just as all the workers had not yet reacted,
0:11:39|0:11:46|The black-clad men lying in ambush around waved their blades and hand axes, rushing into the printing house, slashing wildly.
0:11:46|0:11:51|Several men in black clothes viciously smashed the curator's arm with a hammer.
0:11:54|0:12:10|These black-clad individuals have clear division of labor. Some are indiscriminately killing the staff, while others are wielding hammers to smash the printing press into pieces. The remaining people are carrying gasoline tanks, pouring them on the already packaged newspapers, and setting them on fire. Their only goal is to make the Commercial Press completely disappear.
0:12:11|0:12:17|The explosion was like a signal, causing the reactionary troops and police hidden in the entire city of Shanghai to swarm out.
0:12:17|0:12:32|They swept through the city like locusts, rushing into residential and commercial shops, even on the streets without rhyme or reason, arbitrarily arresting the people of Shanghai, plunging the entire city into the most helpless chaos.
0:12:32|0:12:38|When the reactionary soldiers and police finished their operation, the truck was already filled with men, women, and children with bound hands and feet.
0:12:39|0:12:46|On the other side, inside the Catholic church, security personnel were seen unloading their firearms, and [Zhou Enlai] stood up straight and spoke.
0:12:49|0:13:1|Finishing speaking, he reached for the holster at his waist, causing the surrounding reactionary soldiers to be on high alert. However, [Zhou Enlai] remained calm in the face of danger, simply opening the holster to show the emptiness inside to Strel.
0:13:1|0:13:8|Placing the gun holster on the table, he continued speaking.
0:14:16|0:14:25|At this moment, Stalin finally hesitated and spoke up.
0:14:25|0:14:42|[Zhou Enlai] listened, ignoring the soldiers around him who were aiming their guns, and walked up to Strel, leaning on the back of a chair and bending down to speak softly in his ear.
0:14:47|0:14:55|Chiang Kai-shek served as the principal of the Whampoa Military Academy before the Northern Expedition, and his temperament was naturally well understood by [Zhou Enlai], who served as the director of the political department of the military academy.
0:14:55|0:15:6|Upon hearing these words, [Stalin] was somewhat shaken. He stood up from his seat, then turned his back to the soldiers, his face dark and menacing. Although he did not personally take part in the atrocities committed by his soldiers,
0:15:6|0:15:16|Those actions were ultimately authorized by themselves. As [Zhou Enlai] said, once the situation changes, they will find it hard to escape blame. Thinking of those workers and masses who were killed or mistakenly killed,
0:15:16|0:15:23|Thinking of the bloody arrests being carried out by his soldiers, and then thinking of the Shanghai Green Gang forces supporting his side.
0:15:23|0:15:33|In Shanghai, the Green Gang was already dominant, and now with their military backing, those gang members acted without any restraint, even more audaciously than the reactionary military and police.
0:15:33|0:15:42|Thinking of this, Stirling suddenly felt a bit dry in the mouth, so he loosened his collar, turned around and said to [Zhou Enlai].
0:15:43|0:15:52|After a pause, he finally made up his mind and continued speaking.
0:16:0|0:16:13|[Zhou Enlai] relaxed his expression, looking resolute, smiled and nodded, then turned and walked towards the church. Opening the door, despite the pouring rain in Shanghai at that moment, [Zhou Enlai] stepped out without hesitation.
0:16:14|0:16:21|The teacher waved his hand lightly to indicate that Stilwell didn't need to say more, and [Zhou Enlai] hurriedly left the Second Division Headquarters with security.
0:16:21|0:16:35|When he was just detained, the sound of gunfire and cries could be heard clearly in the city of Shanghai. Alert as [Zhou Enlai], he quickly understood why Stilwell had invited him to control him tonight.
0:16:35|0:16:42|Shanghai workers' uprising, the chief commander of the armed forces suddenly lost contact, [Zhou Enlai] dared not imagine what chaos would be happening in the city at this moment.
0:16:42|0:16:52|He walked on a street in ruins, the icy rain completely soaking his clothes, clinging tightly to his skin, making [Zhou Enlai] look particularly gaunt.
0:16:52|0:17:1|After this catastrophe, the streets were littered with the lifeless bodies of innocent civilians, their horrifying wounds gushing blood as if in tandem with the pouring rain,
0:17:1|0:17:5|Outlined in the crevices of the bricks on the street. Outside the Commercial Press, [Mao Zedong] stood.
0:17:5|0:17:15|The remaining warning to the people of Shanghai was soaked in blood, with raindrops tapping on the blood and paper, much like the furious heart of [Zhou Enlai] at this moment.
0:17:15|0:17:24|Rising infinite waves. Overthrowing military dictatorship, eliminating all reactionary forces, the words on the blood-stained paper are like pearls, yet to be distributed to the public.
0:17:24|0:17:31|It has already been stifled in the bud by the joint forces of reactionary military police and gangsters, which is regrettable.
0:17:31|0:17:47|Some time later, in the luxurious mansion of Nanjing Hospital, [Jiang Jieshi] sat on the sofa, watching the graceful dance of foreign men and women in front of him. He waved his hand to dismiss two foreigners, then turned his head to look at [Yu Jishi] and spoke.
0:18:28|0:18:40|[Jiang Jieshi], at this time serving as the Commander-in-Chief of the National Revolutionary Army, was secretly communicating with the warlord [Zhang Zuolin], indicating that he had completely abandoned the teachings of Mr. Sun Yat-sen and betrayed the revolution.
0:18:40|0:18:45|At the same time, the Communists are holding the Fifth Plenary Session.
0:19:22|0:19:32|Amidst the applause of the many delegates, [Chen Duxiu] stood up from his seat at the head and gazed into the air, saying.
0:20:59|0:21:8|Chen Duxiu, who received the telegram, sat down weakly without caring about the chaotic meeting room.
0:21:19|0:21:28|The moment these words were spoken, the entire assembly was shocked beyond belief, leaving everyone speechless and the room silent, only hearing [Chen Duxiu] crying uncontrollably, heartbroken.
0:21:29|0:21:41|Qian Dajun was one of the earliest communists in China and also the representative of the Communist International in China. Zhang Zuolin, incited by Jiang Jieshi, falsely accused him of colluding with the Soviet Union to overthrow the Beiyang government of the Republic of China.
0:21:41|0:21:52|Mercilessly strangled him. Everyone present was deeply influenced by Mr. Li's ideology. After a moment of shock at the sudden bad news, they stood up, took off their hats to show their respect. Only one person in the meeting room.
0:21:52|0:22:1|Sitting on the bench, he was dressed in a coarse robe, with a center-parted hairstyle. His cheeks were flushed with anger, and the fingers holding the cigarette butt were trembling slightly.
0:22:1|0:22:10|While everyone was still immersed in grief, he viciously stubbed out his cigarette on the ground, stood up abruptly, and shouted loudly.
0:23:14|0:23:22|The one who was extremely angry because Comrade Li Dazhao was killed and argued with the then Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPC, [Chen Duxiu], is the future leader of China.
0:23:25|0:23:43|Chen Duxiu, in a fit of anger, was unable to communicate. Mao Zedong had to leave the venue despite the attempts of those around him to stop him. Little did he know that his concise and forceful speech that day had already caught the attention of numerous party comrades. Several of those who were most deeply moved would go on to make a significant mark in history.
0:23:44|0:23:50|For example Xiang Jingyu, for example Chen Geng, for example [Su Yu].
0:24:10|0:24:17|On the other side, in Shanghai, [Zhou Enlai] stood by the window, gazing at the sky, silently making a vow in his heart.
0:24:25|0:24:32|The woman speaking is [Deng Yingchao], who was the Secretary of the Political Department directly under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China at that time, and also the wife of [Zhou Enlai].
0:25:9|0:25:20|[Deng Yingchao] walked up to him with concern. By June, the attitude of the Wuhan government towards the Communists had deteriorated significantly. Understanding his wife's worry, he knew that revolution always came with danger.
0:25:20|0:25:27|The two of them resolutely went to Wuhan. In the next scene, [Mao Zedong], who had just finished swimming, was buttoning up his shirt and speaking.
0:25:48|0:25:59|[Zhou Enlai] saw [Mao Zedong] handing him the cigarette, so he took it and took a puff.
0:26:3|0:26:10|Hearing the hidden meaning in [Mao Zedong]'s words, [Zhou Enlai] smiled and said.
0:27:28|0:27:34|Seeing the spirited Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai had an inexplicable trust in him and asked.
0:27:39|0:27:50|Deeply looking at [Mao Zedong], [Zhou Enlai] said, and after that, the two of them smiled at each other, tightly holding hands, [Zhou Enlai] continued passionately.
0:28:7|0:28:17|Unfortunately, these words were not needed to express their deep feelings. The two of them swept away the recent gloom, embracing each other as if they had found a kindred spirit, standing together under the Wangjiang Pavilion.
0:28:25|0:28:40|[Wang Jingwei] and a group of senior military officers are in a meeting. In the midst of their conversation, a soldier enters and hands over a recently intercepted confidential report to [Wang Jingwei].
0:28:42|0:28:48|So, a nearby military officer stepped forward, reading the confidential report, as [Wang Jingwei] spoke to him.
0:28:49|0:28:55|Watching the confidential report, a general on the scene had a deep and somewhat worried look in his eyes.
0:29:2|0:29:10|As an underground Communist Party member, [Ye Ting] informed [Zhou Enlai] of the secret report.
0:29:37|0:29:47|The situation is urgent. While [Zhou Enlai] and others were busy in Wuhan, [Jiang Jieshi] in Nanjing was dancing gracefully with [Song Meiling] at a lively banquet.
0:31:7|0:31:15|Seeing [Jiang Jieshi] looking at himself, he smiled. On the other side, [Zhou Enlai] also visited [He Long].
0:31:51|0:31:59|Zhou Enlai waved his hand and said, while He Long, in an excited state, approached.
0:32:6|0:32:13|Zhou Enlai smiled, stood up from his chair, and walked over to [He Long], speaking.
0:32:51|0:33:4|[He Long] looked solemnly into the eyes, the two of them chatted happily, their hearts surging. Standing by the window, they held hands firmly, unwavering.
0:33:4|0:33:14|Meanwhile, in a warehouse in Wuhan, [Mao Zedong] is selecting weapons and firearms.
0:33:35|0:33:41|Looking at the silver dollar handed over by [Mao Zedong], he said. After a moment of hesitation, [Mao Zedong] handed over his pocket watch.
0:33:54|0:33:59|Nodding, he continued.
0:34:10|0:34:17|On the other side, Zhou Enlai visited the widow of Mr. Sun, [Song Qingling].
0:34:34|0:34:40|Turning around, Mao Zedong said to [Zhou Enlai].
0:35:27|0:35:35|Finishing her speech, she smiled and shook hands with [Zhou Enlai], looking approvingly at the young man in front of her. The scene then shifted to the government office building in Wuhan.
0:36:17|0:36:23|At this moment, another log was added in front of everyone.
0:36:36|0:36:45|Before he could finish his sentence, [Zhang Fakui] was so certain that [Wang Jingwei] decided to retreat in order to advance, putting on a caring appearance and saying.
0:36:46|0:37:3|[Zhang Fakui] was somewhat helpless. He led the Fourth Army with [He Long] to fight in various battles, forming a deep friendship. He himself did not oppose the Communist Party, and a large portion of his senior officers were Communist Party members. [Wang Jingwei] was pressing hard step by step, and as his subordinate, [Zhang Fakui] could only obey orders.
0:37:3|0:37:7|The scene shifts to the training camp of the 24th Division in Jiangxi.
0:37:38|0:37:51|On the other side, [Ye Ting] invited [He Long], [Ye Ting], and [Zhou Enlai] to discuss the response strategy for the Lushan Conference on a boat on the river. The group sat around a table eating freshly caught fish and sipping fish soup, as [Zhou Yiqun] spoke.
0:38:20|0:38:26|The fish is delicious and flavorful, all thanks to [him].
0:38:33|0:38:41|[Ye Ting] called over [Su Yu], who was on duty, took the bowl from [Su Yu], who quickly said thank you and sat back on the bench. [Ye Ting] habitually started chatting with [Ye Jianying] in Cantonese.
0:39:57|0:40:4|[Zhou Enlai] nodded with a smile.
0:40:13|0:40:20|After the boat meeting, [Zhou Enlai] gathered the important military leaders in the training ground to inform them of the central committee's decision.
0:40:20|0:40:33|The next morning, [Ye Ting] led his troops to station in Nanchang. His soldiers were dressed neatly and upright, sitting on horses leading the march. The soldiers under his command were fully armed, with a strong military presence and high morale.
0:40:33|0:40:41|Residents outside the city watched curiously along the streets, discussing animatedly. The troops marched forward and arrived outside Nanjing city.
0:40:41|0:40:50|The defending general led his soldiers to block [Ye Ting] and others in Wengcheng. After the military salute, he spoke.
0:41:8|0:41:17|Upon seeing Chen Feng's ignorance, [Ye Ting] immediately took out a notebook from his pocket and a pen from his chest, and wrote two big characters on the paper with great vigor.
0:41:17|0:41:26|Ordering the tearing of the paper, handed by [Su Yu] to Chen Feng, then spoke arrogantly. Chen Feng was about to say something, but [Ye Ting] shouted loudly.
0:41:32|0:41:43|Beside him, [Su Yu] shouted loudly, inspiring the surrounding people to raise their arms and cheer, welcoming the Iron Army into the city. [Ye Ting] rode his horse and led his troops to rush through the city gates.
0:41:43|0:41:50|On the other side, [Jiang Jieshi] is talking to his subordinates in the office.
0:42:40|0:42:48|The scene shifts to Tongcheng County, Hubei Province, where Luo Ronghuan successfully received a large amount of military supplies. Watching the comrades busy in the courtyard, [Mao Zedong] said.
0:42:52|0:42:57|Meanwhile, in the city of Nanchang, [Zhou Enlai] also successfully met with [Zhu De].
0:44:4|0:44:13|The officer who had eaten the rice noodles first heard it and questioned Zhao Fusheng. The officer stood up with a cold face and asked Zhao Fusheng to repeat it again.
0:44:14|0:44:22|At that moment, [Ye Ting] sitting in the corner slammed the table and walked over.
0:44:36|0:44:42|He viciously struck Zhao Fusheng and then said.
0:44:48|0:44:55|The little incident here was caught by the patrolling [Chen Feng].
0:45:58|0:46:5|[Chen Feng] held a silver dollar and knocked on Zhao Fusheng, confirming that he had accepted it, then smiled and said.
0:46:11|0:46:16|With a respectful expression, [Chen Feng] was seen off, and Zhao Fusheng's face instantly changed. He angrily slammed the bowl and chopsticks on the table.
0:46:16|0:46:21|Departing in anger. The scene shifts to the Lecture Hall in Nanchang City.
0:46:32|0:46:43|The troops stationed here are well-trained, proficient in all aspects of combat including cutting, hacking, and shooting.
0:46:43|0:46:48|[Zhu De] was analyzing and introducing the distribution and situation of armed forces in various locations within the city of Nanchang.
0:46:58|0:47:8|At the same time, [Chen Duxiu] led a group of soldiers, pretending to be filming scenery inside the city of Nanchang, recording the weapons configuration and personnel distribution of the stationed troops in various locations.
0:47:13|0:47:19|[Zhu De] and a group of senior generals gathered in the conference room to allocate tasks.
0:47:32|0:47:42|After the operation was swiftly carried out, cutting off the enemy's retreat, [Zhu De] planted the flag at the location of Niuxing Train Station on the map and issued a stern order. Then, looking at the surrounding generals, he pointed at the Fanta Yamen on the map with a wooden stick and said solemnly.
0:48:14|0:48:19|After a long silence, [Liu Bocheng] suddenly spoke out the key point, and everyone's faces turned a bit serious.
0:48:19|0:48:27|At this moment, [Zhang Guotao], a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, arrived in Nanchang and met with various generals at the Jiangxi Dajuyuan Hotel.
0:48:27|0:48:37|Passing a secret letter to [Zhou Enlai], [Zhang Guotao] spoke ambiguously.
0:49:39|0:49:47|[Zhang Guotao] looked at him coldly, but [He Long] didn't mind and turned to ask [Zhou Enlai].
0:50:42|0:50:56|Sensing the firmness of the people here and the delicate situation, [Zhang Guotao] scrutinized his subordinates with his eyes. From their faces, [Zhang Guotao] only saw a resolute determination and fearless spirit that was bound to happen.
0:50:58|0:51:5|Watching [Zhang Guotao] sitting down with a shrunken posture, his hand holding the cup trembling uncontrollably, [Tan Pingshan] stood up and said a few words to ease the tension.
0:51:8|0:51:13|Seeing [Zhou Enlai] leading the group, raising their arms high,
0:51:28|0:51:44|At this point, there was no doubt about the Nanchang Uprising, just waiting for the right time. In the early morning of August 1, 1927, [He Long]'s stationed troops received urgent orders to assemble. All soldiers were fully armed, carrying firearms and ammunition, lining up on the training ground.
0:51:48|0:52:5|At 4 o'clock in the morning, [Zhao Fusheng] took the red scarf and white towel handed to him by the company commander. Seeing the soldiers around him earnestly tying them on, he knew that something big was going to happen in Nanchang tonight. So, he rubbed the towel on his mouth haphazardly and left the barracks while everyone was busy.
0:52:5|0:52:11|Meanwhile, [Zhu De] hosted a banquet at the guesthouse in the city, entertaining senior military commanders stationed in Nanchang.
0:52:46|0:52:56|[Zhu De] clapped his hands twice, and amidst the excited cheers of the officers, a group of beautiful and charming singers walked in gracefully.
0:53:36|0:53:41|The sudden turn of events made the faces of everyone in the council chamber even more serious.
0:53:41|0:53:47|As the agreed time approached, the preparations for the uprising had already begun.
0:53:47|0:53:55|[Su Yu] led a small team of soldiers to sneak into the Niuxing Railway Station under the cover of night, quietly removing the high sentry and taking their place.
0:53:55|0:54:4|They vigilantly aimed at the inside of the station, monitoring every move of the stationed troops, [Su Yu] spoke up to remind the soldiers.
0:54:13|0:54:18|As feared by [Zhou Enlai] and others, the news of the uprising was eventually leaked by Zhao Fusheng.
0:54:18|0:54:24|The information was leaked to [Chen Feng]. Outside the Gongyuan where the 23rd Regiment was stationed, the rebel soldiers had also taken care of the sentries.
0:54:24|0:54:28|Lurking around, waiting for the signal to start the uprising. On the other side, [Mao Zedong]...
0:54:28|0:54:36|Chen Feng, who received a secret report from Zhao Fusheng, wasted no time and strode into the local government office, shouting at the subordinates inside.
0:54:41|0:54:49|However, the idle soldiers, accustomed to leisure, paid no attention to the commander's words. The chatting continued lively, and those playing cards acted as if they hadn't heard anything.
0:54:49|0:55:5|Chen Feng watched as the soldier who rushed out of the dormitory upon hearing the order, with his uniform in disarray and knocking over a basin, soaked all over. He couldn't help but feel sorrow in his heart, took off his military cap and burst into laughter, waving to call the soldier over to him.
0:55:5|0:55:26|Chen Feng waved his hand and slapped it up, surprising the people around him, who stopped laughing and looked at Chen Feng, only to hear him bend down and say to the soldier in front of him.
0:55:32|0:55:37|With this example, the soldiers finally realized the seriousness of the situation and quickly armed themselves.
0:55:37|0:55:40|In the meeting room on the other side, [Zhou Enlai] asked. Ready.
0:55:52|0:56:5|The time for the uprising is approaching. The perimeters of the garrisons in the city have been infiltrated and surrounded by the rebels. They are only waiting for the signal from headquarters to launch a swift attack on the positions before the enemy can react.
0:56:5|0:56:19|At this moment, a tense and oppressive atmosphere prevails in the Jiangxi Grand Hotel, just before the big battle. People are not joking around, especially [Zhou Enlai], who is repeatedly going over the plan in his mind, determined to ensure the success of the uprising.
0:56:20|0:56:25|Finally, he got up and walked towards the door, with everyone following closely behind him.
0:56:25|0:56:31|Arriving at the inn entrance, [Zhou Enlai] drew his handgun from his waist and fired three shots into the night sky.
0:56:34|0:56:41|Due to Zhao Fusheng's reasons, the Nanchang Uprising officially broke out at 2 a.m. on August 1st.
0:56:46|0:56:59|Upon hearing the signal, [He Long], although unaware of the reason for the early plan, acted decisively and immediately commanded his soldiers to prepare to capture the local government office. At the same time, the artillery units outside the city received the signal and provided immediate fire support.
0:57:1|0:57:6|The artillery fire covered the garrisons' positions everywhere except for the provincial yamen. The provincial yamen was located in the city, adjacent to residential areas.
0:57:7|0:57:16|The rebel army, considering civilian casualties, did not shell this area. The remaining defending troops in other places were powerless in the face of the bombardment and fled in haste.
0:57:16|0:57:19|Not long after, [Zhou Enlai] received the good news.
0:57:21|0:57:34|On the other side, the soldiers lying in ambush outside the train station advanced to the barracks, threw grenades into the room, and then rushed in, effortlessly subduing the dazed enemies.
0:57:47|0:57:56|Chen Feng, stationed at the local yamen command post, flew into a rage upon learning that Niuxing Railway Station had fallen, and angrily slammed the phone in front of him to the ground.
0:57:56|0:58:3|Looking at the rebel army, after the sky full of artillery fire dispersed, the soldiers hidden everywhere rushed into the residence of the Gong's.
0:58:3|0:58:13|With a quick glance at the armband and scarf, the character swiftly dealt with the battle. Inside the city, the cannons roared continuously, and the sound of gunfire filled the air.
0:58:13|0:58:20|The grand commotion finally broke through the lively atmosphere of the banquet hall. [Zhu De] looked at the now quiet crowd and smiled as he spoke.
0:58:24|0:58:37|The enemy generals present were not fools. Sensing the commotion, they immediately pushed aside the soft and fragrant beauty beside them and hurriedly ran out of the building. However, they were shocked back by a shot fired by [Zhu De] into the air. Looking around, they found themselves already surrounded by armed soldiers of the uprising.
0:58:37|0:58:43|They finally realized that the so-called banquet reception was just to disrupt the command system of the Kuomintang army.
0:58:43|0:58:50|Occupying the garrisons of the enemy forces stationed everywhere, all troops gradually converged and rushed towards the city gate tower to begin the assault.
0:58:50|0:58:56|The enemy forces here are resisting fiercely due to their advantageous position, well-equipped weapons, and strong determination.
0:58:56|0:59:8|Enemy generals commanded their soldiers to set up machine guns on the high buildings in the city, madly shooting at the uprising army below. In the darkness of the night, countless streaks of fire resembled venomous snakes spitting out their tongues, creating a terrifying sight.
0:59:8|0:59:12|The exploding firelight was like a second sun, illuminating the city tower as bright as day.
0:59:14|0:59:18|The rebel soldiers charged forward with their flesh and blood, fearless of death.
0:59:18|0:59:29|The terrain here is treacherous and difficult to attack, and due to concerns for civilians, the artillery outside the city cannot fully support, resulting in a stalemate in the battle.
0:59:31|0:59:39|In the command post of the provincial government office, [Chen Feng] received the battle report and, feeling overwhelmed, he sat at the table with a water cup in hand, lowering his head.
0:59:39|0:59:54|He knew that if any part of the main street and city gate were lost, his yamen would be captured by the rebels, it was only a matter of time. So, he cleared his mind, somewhat tired yet very determined, and ordered decisively.
1:0:6|1:0:17|The scene shifts to the main street battlefield. [He Long] leads his troops deep into the battlefront, charging at the forefront. His soldiers, known as the Iron Army, sweep through the area like a whirlwind, charging forward relentlessly.
1:0:17|1:0:18|Just like a sharp blade piercing deep into the enemy's ranks.
1:0:20|1:0:44|However, this iron army was also blocked near a clock tower on the main street. [He Long], who loved his soldiers like his own children, saw a soldier shot and falling to the ground near the clock tower. He ordered his deputy to throw a bag of flour, then he raised his gun and shot, instantly creating a cloud of dust that obscured the enemy's view on the clock tower. [He Long] quickly ordered someone to drag the injured soldier back to cover. Taking advantage of this distraction, the deputy picked up an explosive pack and charged towards the base of the clock tower.
1:0:44|1:0:55|He Long immediately ordered the entire army to provide covering fire, and finally a huge explosion shattered the bell tower, depriving the enemy of the high ground firepower point. The enemy forces could no longer withstand the assault of He Long's troops and were defeated one after another.
1:0:56|1:1:2|Meanwhile, [Su Yu] led his troops rushing towards the city gate at the train station.
1:1:29|1:1:42|On the other side, the Jiangxi Bank controlled by foreign forces was also occupied by the rebel army. They wrote receipts and used gold bars and other items as military funds. [Chen Feng] saluted the staff and then led the troops away.
1:1:49|1:1:56|Remember to tie a red ribbon on the collar and a white towel on the arm, the isolated [Chen Feng] had no choice but to disguise himself and sneak out of the city to request support. Little did he know, the small team of soldiers he sent out,
1:2:2|1:2:10|Suddenly remembering the order from [Zhou Enlai], [Su Yu] then looked at the opponent's arm.
1:2:13|1:2:24|Seeing the six people with white towels wrapped neatly around their left arms, he knew they were enemies, not friends, so he decisively opened fire and shot them on the spot. [Chen Feng] clung to the fantasy of waiting for reinforcements.
1:2:24|1:2:35|The illusion shattered. The high alertness and the deafening close-range gunfire made the newly arrived young soldier collapse on the ground, screaming in fear. [Su Yu] snapped out of it and walked up to him, roaring.
1:2:47|1:2:54|Hearing that the allied forces at the front were blocked, [Ye Ting] in the council chamber took command and quickly organized his subordinates to rush to the main street for support.
1:2:59|1:3:5|As the war intensified, the government office was already in chaos, with wounded soldiers being carried into the house one after another.
1:3:5|1:3:12|In front of the command table, only [Chen Feng] remains steadfast, with all manpower dispatched to the front lines to block the rebel army.
1:3:12|1:3:24|At this time, [Chen Feng] was already at his wit's end, and upon hearing the report from his deputy, he felt a deep sense of sorrow. Knowing that defending the city was hopeless, he couldn't contain his anger, and he let loose, preparing for a desperate fight to the death.
1:3:24|1:3:34|He rushed to the front line with his aide without saying a word, pushed aside the soldiers operating the machine gun, crouched behind the sandbag cover himself, operated the machine gun, and fired wildly towards the troops of [He Long] in front.
1:3:35|1:3:46|In an instant, a large number of rebel soldiers were splattered with blood and fell to the ground. [He Long] quickly ordered everyone to find cover and take cover, while taking advantage of the moment when [Chen Feng] was reloading.
1:3:46|1:3:50|Spraying a burst of gunfire from the submachine gun onto the enemy machine gun.
1:3:50|1:3:57|[Chen Feng] was shot in the left shoulder, but with a fierce spirit, he quickly reloaded and continued firing at the rebel army, forcing [He Long] to retreat.
1:4:10|1:4:25|The bugle sounded, and countless rebels carrying large flags charged into the battlefield under intense enemy gunfire. At that moment, the main street of Nanchang was ablaze, with explosions throwing up sand and rocks, completely changing the appearance of the entire street.
1:4:26|1:4:33|The rebel forces each found good cover and engaged in bloody battles with the defending troops in front of them. However, the enemy forces entrenched here are all elite troops under [Chen Feng].
1:4:33|1:4:44|At this moment, [Chen Feng] himself was on the battlefield, seriously injured but refusing to leave the front line. Although the garrison troops were usually idle, they were now fighting for their lives, with the commander still leading the battle.
1:4:44|1:4:50|In the midst of gunfire and bullets, the attacks by [Ye Ting]'s troops were repeatedly repelled by the enemy.
1:4:50|1:4:53|The main street is littered with countless corpses, blood flowing everywhere.
1:4:53|1:5:5|The rebel army suffered heavy casualties. Upon hearing the news, [Zhou Enlai] couldn't help but furrow his brow, feeling endless worry in his heart. Meanwhile,
1:5:5|1:5:10|On the bloody battlefield, numerous wounded soldiers are waiting for rescue.
1:5:23|1:5:32|Just as Peng Yuanhua was hurriedly rescuing the wounded, the rebel soldiers finally advanced within mortar range, and their close-range shooting was precise enough.
1:5:32|1:5:41|No harm will be done to civilians. Soldiers set up the cannons, aim at the trenches, and adjust the shooting angles.
1:5:43|1:5:49|With a command from [He Long], three mortars fired simultaneously, and the shells whistled towards the enemy trenches.
1:5:49|1:6:0|In the distance, [Chen Feng] was still engaged in combat with the frontal troops. Suddenly, he seemed to hear the muffled sound of artillery fire, slowly turned his head, and the next second, three shells exploded in the middle of the trench.
1:6:0|1:6:8|[Chen Feng] and his stubborn soldiers were engulfed by the blazing flames. On the other side, at the Deshengmen battlefield,
1:6:8|1:6:26|After experiencing bloody battles, the rebel army finally advanced and stabilized their position. After ensuring that civilians were not harmed, they brought in mortars and field guns. [Ye Ting] remained calm in the face of danger, standing behind the artillery, ordering the troops to load ammunition and adjust the firing angle.
1:6:29|1:6:34|Upon hearing the news, [Zhou Enlai] turned around and gazed intently at the map of Deshengmen.
1:6:36|1:6:49|On the battlefield, [Ye Ting] fired his gun as a signal, and more than ten cannons erupted with smoke and sparks, causing the soldiers present to feel the ground trembling slightly. Following that, the shells shot out of the barrels, accurately smashing towards the city gate tower.
1:6:52|1:7:5|Receiving the military order, the troops continuously changed ammunition and fired towards the city gate tower. For a moment, in this area, the smell of gunpowder was so strong that it seemed to ignite the air, and the enemy troops were suppressed inside the city tower, unable to move.
1:7:11|1:7:28|Taking advantage of the cover of artillery fire, [Su Yu] led a small team of soldiers to sneak into the trenches outside the city wall. As the shells hit the wall and raised countless dust clouds, [Su Yu] waved his big knife and leaped up, directly chopping off the arm of the enemy operating the machine gun. He locked eyes with [Ye Ting], understanding each other without a word.
1:7:32|1:7:42|After [Su Yu] temporarily withdrew, [Ye Ting] signaled the troops to continue shelling Deshengmen, while [Su Yu] led a small team to bypass to the side of the city gate, braving the artillery fire to defeat the remaining enemies.
1:7:43|1:7:46|The two [characters] cooperated seamlessly, making it difficult for the enemy to defend.
1:7:46|1:7:55|With little effort, [Su Yu] led the charge up the city tower.
1:7:56|1:8:7|The bombardment continued, and after the machine gunner on the city tower was taken care of, [Ye Ting] redirected the artillery fire towards the trenches near the tower, because he knew that the remaining enemy soldiers were no match for [Su Yu].
1:8:7|1:8:15|Sure enough, when the direction of the bombardment shifted, [Su Yu] knew his opportunity had come. Leading by example, he charged forward with a rifle in hand.
1:8:23|1:8:34|The Deshengmen Gate has finally been captured, the great battle is won. [Ye Ting] excitedly roared, his soldiers raised the flag high and rushed into the city tower to assist [Su Yu] in dealing with the enemy prisoners.
1:8:34|1:8:50|On the other side, the good news was also relayed back to the council chamber. Upon hearing the news, [Zhou Enlai]’s face showed a hint of joy for the first time, but it quickly disappeared.
1:8:50|1:8:59|Perhaps he was thinking of the comrades who bravely sacrificed in this battle, or perhaps he was thinking of the arduous journey of struggle after the success of the uprising.
1:8:59|1:9:5|As a key figure of the Communist Party, he had to force himself to see further, even further.
1:9:8|1:9:24|In the chaotic feudal yamen, seeing that the situation was already lost, Zhao Fusheng, with a glimmer of hope, put on the armband and scarf of the rebel army, pretending to be one of the soldiers, escorting prisoners along with others.
1:9:29|1:9:43|In the dimly lit command post, the soldiers did not notice the nervousness and guilt on [Zhao Fusheng]'s face. However, when he arrived at the open square illuminated by the fire, his cautious demeanor seemed out of place compared to the victorious soldiers.
1:9:43|1:9:58|He Long, who respected Chen Feng for sacrificing himself, silently saluted in front of the trench, paying tribute to this dedicated man. Then, he turned around and saw the slightly shrinking Zhao Fusheng. With a cold face, he slowly walked towards him.
1:9:58|1:10:8|Zhao Fusheng, feeling guilty as a thief, knew from the stern expression on [He Long]'s face that his secret had been exposed. He hurriedly knelt on the ground, ready to beg for mercy.
1:10:12|1:10:19|However, the stern [He Long] did not give him a chance to speak, aiming and shooting a single shot to end this traitor.
1:10:20|1:10:28|After hours of bloody fighting, Nanchang City was finally completely captured. By the time the rebel army cleaned up the battlefield, the sky was already getting light.
1:10:28|1:10:39|A crowd gathered outside the Grand Hotel, and with [Zhou Enlai] raising his arms and shouting loudly, all the soldiers present cheered excitedly.
1:10:39|1:10:44|They raised their rifles high and waved the big flag in their arms.
1:10:44|1:10:51|[Zhou Enlai] was also deeply moved, he almost trembled as he walked outside to greet [Ye Ting] and others who were equally excited.
1:10:51|1:10:56|They embraced tightly, laughing and releasing the pent-up frustrations of being at the mercy of others for so long.
1:10:58|1:11:6|The Chinese Communist Party finally established its own armed forces.
1:11:11|1:11:25|The soldier who arrived late and had a heated conversation with [Su Yu] is named [Lin Biao], they met at the Fifth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. At that time, they were soldiers of the Kuomintang guarding outside the council chamber, and now they are Communist soldiers who have experienced the baptism of war.
1:11:27|1:11:34|Squeezed in the crowd, they cheered and celebrated the victory of the struggle together with numerous rebel soldiers and the people of Nanchang.
1:11:35|1:11:43|And [Zhou Enlai] resumed his usual serious demeanor, continuing to plan and worry about the future of the revolution.
1:12:51|1:12:58|[Jiang Jieshi] placed his chess pieces carefully and spoke slowly.
1:14:45|1:14:53|[Nie Rongzhen] came this time to organize more than two regiments of the 25th Division of [Zhang Fakui] to join the uprising army, strengthening the armed forces of the Communist Party.
1:14:53|1:15:4|The morale of the guerrilla army was unprecedentedly high. When all affairs were in order, on August 3, 1927, [Zhou Enlai] led the rebel forces to withdraw from Nanchang, Jiangxi, and headed south along the Fu River.
1:15:4|1:15:14|Advanced towards Guangdong Chaoshan and Shantou. On August 7 of the same year, in an apartment in Hankou, the Chinese Communist Party held an emergency central meeting, and the Communist International believed that the mistakes of Borodin and [Chen Duxiu] were serious.
1:15:20|1:15:28|Qu Qiubai, a member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the CPC, was diligently taking notes and translating the speech of the Comintern representative, Rothman.
1:15:41|1:15:49|As Qu Qiubai finished speaking, the delegates couldn't wait to applaud. And outside the door,
1:17:18|1:17:28|The meeting ended, Qu Qiubai and [Ren Bishi] came to the outside of the house and stopped [Mao Zedong] who was about to leave.
1:18:11|1:18:33|In the rainy autumn of Hankou, three people stood in the rain, soaking their backs. [Mao Zedong] listened to the two and then spoke. In the end, he did not agree to the requests of the two comrades, because in [Mao Zedong]'s heart, a path of struggle that no one had walked before was brewing, and he firmly believed that this path was exactly what China urgently needed.
1:18:33|1:18:37|After speaking, he left Hankou holding an umbrella and walking in the rain.
1:18:37|1:18:49|While the rebel army was marching south in high spirits, [Mao Zedong] returned to Changsha, where the place had already been tormented by reactionary warlords and lost its vitality.
1:18:49|1:18:59|Reactionary military forces are freely killing Communist Party members in the streets and alleys, not hesitating to make mistakes. Everywhere on the road, there are bloody and mutilated corpses, who may be comrades.
1:18:59|1:19:6|Perhaps just an ordinary commoner. With the people in Changsha city in a state of panic, [Mao Zedong] returned home with complex worries.
1:19:6|1:19:15|Sitting on a bench in the courtyard, Mao Zedong watched the three young children for a while. Finally, he turned to his wife Yang Kaihui, who was inside packing his luggage, and said.
1:19:34|1:19:53|With a worried expression on his face, [Mao Zedong] finally showed a hint of a smile upon hearing [Yang Kaihui]'s words. Inside the room, [Yang Kaihui] sensed her husband's dilemma and hesitation. She walked out and gently sat beside [Mao Zedong], looking at her somewhat tall and slender wife. [Mao Zedong] felt an indescribable sense of guilt in his heart.
1:20:17|1:20:27|Without waiting for [Mao Zedong] to finish speaking, [Yang Kaihui] gently and firmly took her husband's arm, soothing Mao Zedong's restless mind with the most sincere words of affection.
1:20:27|1:20:46|When the comrades from the party came to meet him, [Mao Zedong] had to leave again. The family stood at the village entrance, with two slightly older children holding onto their mother's clothes. The young children couldn't stop crying, and [Yang Kaihui] held them in her arms. This scene was what [Mao Zedong] saw in his eyes. He stepped forward, ruffled the children's heads, and was about to speak.
1:20:49|1:20:58|[Mao Zedong] knew his wife's good intentions, but the more [Yang Kaihui] was like this, the more he couldn't let go. He dared not look at his wife's thin face, hesitated, and turned away.
1:21:15|1:21:23|[Mao Zedong], who was about to turn back, was scolded by his wife. He turned around again and walked forward slowly, reluctant to leave.
1:21:23|1:21:29|It's as if with every step further away from his beloved family, he had to draw out all his strength. In this desolate village,
1:21:31|1:21:37|The traces of their past lives, at this moment, are tugging at the soul of [Mao Zedong], leaving a part of it forever in Banchang Village.
1:21:37|1:21:48|And the woman who has been silently supporting him since the beginning of the revolution, seeing her husband's increasingly distant figure, finally shed tears in secret.
1:21:48|1:22:1|[Yang Kaihui] tightened her grip on her child's arm, the warmth in her embrace being her only solace. The loving couple never imagined that this separation would become their final farewell.
1:22:11|1:22:18|With the voice of [Wang Jingwei]'s aide, the scene shows the fierce battle led by [Ye Ting] and the rebel army.
1:22:27|1:22:37|[Wang Jingwei] practiced calligraphy, seemingly unaffected by the bloody battles in the early morning, where the lives of those dead Chinese children and women were lost.
1:22:41|1:22:46|[Qian Dajun] was the commander of the 32nd Army and one of [Jiang Jieshi]'s key aides.
1:23:48|1:23:54|Presenting the application letter, and giving the standard military salute to [Zhou Enlai], [He Long] officially applies to join the party.
1:23:54|1:24:8|The crowd on the scene was deeply moved. In the face of the crisis of the uprising army, they resolutely joined the party, injecting a strong stimulant for everyone. [Zhou Enlai] was also deeply moved, to the point that he did not adhere to military discipline at this moment.
1:24:8|1:24:17|He extended his right hand and tightly shook hands with [He Long], then embraced each other, the excitement was beyond words. The camera then switched to another scene.
1:24:17|1:24:26|The scene shifts to the Tungkushan area in Jiangxi, where [Mao Zedong] is unexpectedly captured by bandits in the mountains.
1:24:40|1:24:44|Glancing at the leader who went to relieve himself, [Mao Zedong] pointed to his own crotch with his chin.
1:24:56|1:25:12|Two bandits, somewhat decent, took the money and untied the rope binding [Mao Zedong]'s hands, gesturing for him to run forward quickly. After [Mao Zedong] had run a distance, the bandits fired a shot into the air, pretending to shout in panic.
1:25:13|1:25:24|Hearing the gunshots and shouts, [Mao Zedong] didn't dare to delay. He ran swiftly through the bamboo forest, accidentally falling into a shallow pit. He then hid and lay low, cautiously peeking out to look around.
1:25:25|1:25:28|Suddenly, three rifles were pointed right in front of him.
1:25:28|1:25:35|[Mao Zedong] turned back in dismay, the first thing he saw was several soldiers in military uniforms of the Kuomintang, then he noticed the collar and left arm,
1:25:35|1:25:42|There were red and white towels. [Mao Zedong] weakly leaned against the pile of soil and smiled, because he knew he was finally safe.
1:25:42|1:25:50|So they arrived at the base of the rebel army together with the soldiers. The soldiers, who did not yet know their identities, reported to the officer.
1:25:57|1:26:6|The officer walked slowly to [Mao Zedong]'s side and sat down, pausing for a moment before asking him.
1:27:7|1:27:15|[Mao Zedong] did not answer, but walked to the front of the Kuomintang flag, lit the cigarette at the corner of his mouth, frowned, as if thinking about something.
1:27:15|1:27:20|The crying next door kept touching his heart, leaving him speechless for a long time.
1:27:20|1:27:22|So, an officer explained.
1:28:0|1:28:12|Upon hearing Lu Deming's question, Mao Zedong pondered for a moment, then quickly returned to the table, dipped his brush in ink, and wrote down a few large characters on the paper. He lifted the paper and showed it to everyone. The banner read from top to bottom:
1:28:12|1:28:20|The First Division of the First Army of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Army. [Mao Zedong] spoke first.
1:28:22|1:28:33|After gaining everyone's approval, the group began to design a new flag for the uprising army. After much discussion, they ultimately decided to choose red as the base color for the flag, completely different from the flag of the Kuomintang.
1:28:33|1:28:51|In the center is a five-pointed star representing the leadership of the Communist Party, with a sickle and hammer embedded inside the star symbolizing the alliance of workers and peasants. A cloth strip is sewn on one side of the flag near the flagpole, with eleven characters in regular script vertically written, "1st Army, 1st Division of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Army". This is the first military flag of the Chinese Communist Party.
1:28:51|1:29:1|On September 9, 1927, waving a newly designed military flag, [Lu Deming] and [Mao Zedong] led a group to set off to the border between Jiangxi and Hunan.
1:29:1|1:29:7|After 10 days, in most counties of Guangdong Province, the rebel army led by [Zhou Enlai] set up a temporary command post here.
1:29:7|1:29:14|It's mealtime, and the kitchen staff in the courtyard are busy preparing food.
1:30:15|1:30:24|Although the words were spoken like this, everyone knew the difficulty of this battle. [Zhou Enlai] solemnly walked up to [Zhu De] and before he could speak, he heard him speak first.
1:30:28|1:30:37|Upon hearing this, [Zhou Enlai]'s facial muscles twitched slightly, as he gazed at the old comrade and senior in front of him, slowly reaching out his hand to shake hands with [Zhu De].
1:30:37|1:30:45|On the side, colleagues were also extremely serious, with the determination of [He Long] heating up their eyes, and the boldness of [Ye Ting] cooling their faces.
1:30:45|1:30:51|On the other side, in Shangping Village, Hunan, [Lu Deming] gathered the soldiers together.
1:31:41|1:31:48|In the middle of the square, [Mao Zedong] looked around at the soldiers shouting with all their might, his eyes filled with severity and his face showing worry.
1:31:50|1:31:57|Walking down from the high platform, [Mao Zedong] approached [Lu Deming] and patted his shoulder, saying heavily.
1:32:4|1:32:10|The reactionary forces showed no sign of retreat, with troops continuously closing in, seemingly intent on wiping out the revolutionary army in one fell swoop.
1:32:10|1:32:14|Halfway through their journey, the Third Regiment of the rear guard was suddenly ambushed by enemy forces from multiple directions, resulting in heavy casualties.
1:32:18|1:32:26|To cover the retreat of the main force, [Lu Deming] personally led a platoon to ambush the enemy, while the scattered soldiers of the third regiment quickly closed in on the vanguard.
1:32:26|1:32:37|However, at that moment, a bullet tore through the air and struck [Lu Deming] directly in the right chest, causing a horrifying gush of blood to flow from the wound, instantly staining his clothes.
1:32:37|1:32:46|Lu Deming, lying on the ground, was protected by soldiers and dragged away from the battlefield.
1:32:47|1:33:2|The scene of living and fighting together with [Lu Deming] still lingers in [Mao Zedong]'s mind, but now they are worlds apart.
1:33:12|1:33:38|Comrade [Lu Deming], covered with the flag of the revolutionary army of workers and peasants and the vast sky, lying on a simple yet solemn and sacred funeral ceremony with dry grass under his body and the earth beneath him, slept deeply until the scorching and busy fire enveloped him, turning his flesh and bones into revolutionary sparks, residing in the hearts of every soldier, forever wandering on the land of China.
1:33:38|1:33:49|At the same time, in Sanheba, Guangzhou, [Zhu De] is leading three thousand rebel soldiers to dig trenches. He arrives at the front line and personally supervises the preparations before the battle.
1:33:49|1:33:55|Facing an enemy ten times their size, even [Zhu De] couldn't help but feel immense pressure.
1:33:55|1:34:0|He reminded the busy soldiers, saying.
1:34:16|1:34:39|Arranging the requirements for building the trenches, [Zhu De] sat on the sandbags on the high ground, casually picked up a dry tree branch, and sketched the terrain of the entire Sanhe Dam on the ground. Greedily craving for the cigarette in his mouth, he furrowed his brow, occasionally looking up at the surrounding mountains, rivers, and comparing them with the map he drew, perfecting the ambush plan in his mind. Finally, he summoned his subordinates and generals.
1:35:16|1:35:21|Assigning tasks, the serious and earnest demeanor of the generals made [Zhu De] feel somewhat relieved.
1:35:21|1:35:27|But watching their young and tender figures, [Zhu De] couldn't help but stand up and remind everyone.
1:35:46|1:35:54|Next, what awaits [Zhu De] and the 3000 uprising soldiers is a fierce attack from the former Grand Army.
1:36:46|1:37:6|On the other side, [Mao Zedong] has led the revolutionary army to successfully break through and settle in Jinggangshan. Here, he will guide his soldiers and local residents to establish the first revolutionary base of the Communist Party of China, exploring the correct path of surrounding the cities with rural areas and seizing power through armed struggle, a path that previous revolutionaries had not taken.
1:37:6|1:37:19|Compared to Mao Zedong's revolutionary army, the situation of Zhu De and Zhou Enlai's rebel army is much more difficult. Leading a large force retreating to Guangdong, Zhou Enlai is constantly worried about the safety of Zhu De and his 3000 soldiers.
1:37:19|1:37:29|Looking at the completed trench works at Sanheba, the young soldiers standing ready, and the heavily guarded enemy camp across the river, [Zhu De] felt the same sense of worry in his heart.
1:37:29|1:37:35|Unlike Zhou Enlai, Zhu De is not worried about his own life and death, but whether he can withstand the pressure.
1:37:35|1:37:41|Defend the Sanhe Dam until the main forces withdraw. How many of the soldiers who fought together against the enemy can survive,
1:37:42|1:37:48|He dared not dwell on it, only firmly telling himself, "I must hold on, and I will hold on."
1:37:48|1:38:2|On October 1, 1927, the former General Staff Headquarters on the opposite side of the river was fully assembled, and [Zhu De] immediately ordered the soldiers to be ready for battle. On the opposite bank, [Qian Dajun]'s troops were observing the positions of the rebel army through binoculars.
1:38:2|1:38:6|The aide reported to him that the enemy had defenses set up all along the opposite bank for over 10 miles.
1:38:24|1:38:33|The military order was as firm as a mountain, and the deputy general immediately dispatched his fourth regiment to cross the cold river on a bamboo raft. Upon noticing this, the rebels quickly reported to Zhu De.
1:38:34|1:38:56|The enemy forces began to attack. Upon hearing the battle report, [Zhu De] did not show much emotional fluctuation. After several days of preparation, he, who had already put life and death aside, must now face the impending fierce battle with enough composure. Whether there are 30,000 or 300,000 enemy troops in front of him, he must defend Sanheba for three days, ensuring that the revolutionary spark is not extinguished here.
1:38:56|1:39:2|With such determination and fighting spirit, [Zhu De] was already stationed on the mudflats where the enemy might land.
1:39:2|1:39:10|Lying in ambush with a small unit, waiting for the right moment. In a nearby stone cave, [Chen Yi] and [Lin Biao] led troops in ambush.
1:39:10|1:39:15|They were covered with grass, hidden among the lush trees, holding guns on guard.
1:39:15|1:39:23|Even though the enemy had entered shooting range, they still did not open fire, quietly waiting for [Zhu De]'s command.
1:39:26|1:39:35|Lowering his binoculars, [Zhu De] said. [Zhu De] did not order an attack, knowing that this small group of troops could not be the main force of [Qian Dajun]'s army.
1:39:35|1:39:46|At the beginning of the conflict, the enemy sent a troop to land, most likely to probe the strength of the rebel army, so the first battle had to be fought steadily and fiercely.
1:39:48|1:39:58|The vanguard of the enemy has landed on Shizi'an, slowly moving towards the ambush circle. The soldiers' palms are sweating, their breathing quickens, their hearts pounding, but still not a single shot is fired.
1:39:58|1:40:5|Finally, [Zhu De] shouted out, ordering to open fire with both light and heavy weapons.
1:40:6|1:40:11|Upon receiving the order, [Lin Biao] lifted the grass mat and swung his arm to continuously throw grenades at the enemy troops.
1:40:11|1:40:28|The long and narrow mudflat offered no cover, leaving the enemy with no escape as they could only watch grenades explode among the crowd, causing numerous casualties lying on the shore. Ahead was the fierce gunfire of the rebel army, while behind was the icy cold river.
1:40:28|1:40:35|On the other side, [Qian Dajun] saw the Fourth Division in a dilemma, with bodies lying on the river. He put down his binoculars and gave the order.
1:40:48|1:40:55|After careful adjustments, numerous field guns on the enemy artillery positions opened fire together, with shells heading straight towards the rebel positions.
1:40:56|1:41:2|Feeling the vibration of the earth and the whistling sound of the air, [Lin Biao] shouted loudly, ordering the soldiers to retreat.
1:41:2|1:41:6|The next moment, the shell hit the stone cave hard.
1:41:6|1:41:16|Whether it was the enemy's 4th Regiment or the rebel soldiers, faced with such large-scale and indiscriminate bombing, they had no time to think about anything else and hurried to take cover.
1:41:16|1:41:22|[Zhu De] saw the situation and anxiously jumped down from the high ground, roaring to order the soldiers to enter the trenches to avoid the bombing.
1:41:25|1:41:34|The artillery on the opposite bank is still firing, showing no sign of stopping, while on the other side of the stone cave, it has become a situation where it's hard to distinguish between friend and foe, with people doing their best to dodge the bombardment.
1:41:34|1:41:40|Due to the reminder from [Lin Biao], some of the rebel soldiers retreated backwards, with minimal impact.
1:41:40|1:41:46|However, the soldiers fighting on the front line against the enemy had no time to react and were overturned by the explosion of the shells.
1:41:46|1:41:58|Blood flowed from the wounds all over the body, wrapping the entire body. The dust raised by the shock wave covered the stone cave, and the flames ignited by the explosion.
1:41:58|1:42:8|The uprising soldiers were tortured and let out painful screams. While [Zhu De]'s position was also under artillery fire, he did not slack off at all as the soldiers hurried to take cover.
1:42:18|1:42:26|The numbers on both sides are already vastly different. If they are beaten down by this artillery barrage, holding onto Sanheba would be a pipe dream.
1:42:26|1:42:38|Just as [Zhu De] anxiously directed the soldiers to take cover, [Lin Biao] also came under fire from follow-up shells. With nowhere to hide on the exposed mudflat, he had no choice but to order the soldiers to seek shelter in the shell craters.
1:42:38|1:42:46|The deafening artillery fire finally stopped after a while, but [Qian Dajun] discontentedly asked.
1:42:54|1:43:2|After listening to the report, [Qian Dajun] said nothing more, just handed the telescope to his aide.
1:43:2|1:43:13|After leaving the front line in anger, following the devastating artillery bombardment, [Qian Dajun] also abandoned the plan to continue the attack. On the ambush circle and positions of the uprising army, the bodies of personnel from both sides were found.
1:43:13|1:43:22|The scene is littered with craters, with flames still sporadically burning on the bomb craters, like hollow eyes staring blankly at the sky.
1:43:22|1:43:31|The river adjacent to the mudflat has been thoroughly soaked in blood, as if the life source of the rebel soldiers has made this icy river water scalding hot.
1:43:31|1:43:39|After the shelling, the position where [Zhu De] was located also suffered heavy losses, with a large number of soldiers who did not have time to retreat into the trenches dying tragically on the soil piles.
1:43:39|1:43:45|Countless soldiers affected by the explosion were ragged, with limbs severed.
1:44:1|1:44:14|He walked heavily beside the wounded soldiers, silent. As he looked up and saw the densely packed bodies piled in the tunnel, [Zhu De] stopped in his tracks.
1:44:14|1:44:26|The soldiers' blood mixed with the river water and mud flowing in the trenches, the originally designed drainage ditches now filled with blood, a shocking sight.
1:44:26|1:44:33|Young bodies lay quietly on the ground, also lying bloodily in the heart of [Zhu De].
1:44:33|1:44:43|The remaining soldiers followed [Zhu De] in slowly taking off their military caps. Even the toughest of men couldn't hold back their tears at this moment.
1:44:43|1:44:47|At this moment, Sanheba was eerily quiet.
1:44:58|1:45:10|After hearing the reports of the losses from the generals, [Zhu De] could not hide his anger, fiercely pounding on the table, then stood up and coldly walked towards the sand table in front of him, calculating the strategies for the future.
1:45:10|1:45:27|The next day, in order to replenish ammunition, [Lin Biao] led a small team back to the stone bank, cleaning up the battlefield, collecting supplies. The strong smell of gunpowder and the burning odor of corpses constantly stimulated the rebel soldiers.
1:45:27|1:45:34|And at that moment, the enemy's attack resumed, with a large amount of bullets and artillery pouring down on the rocky shore. [Lin Biao] felt helpless.
1:45:34|1:45:42|The troops can only do their best to cover the evacuation of the squad. Across the river, the army is observing everything through binoculars.
1:45:44|1:45:51|[Lin Biao] led his troops to quickly evacuate to the vicinity of Longhukeng, and said to [Chen Yi] who was ambushed here.
1:45:52|1:46:5|The handover is completed, [Lin Biao] rushes back to the original front line without stopping, while [Chen Yi] sets up a machine gun at the forefront of the ambush circle in the Longhukeng with grass covering, looking from afar, the enemy is densely advancing towards the rebel army.
1:46:5|1:46:15|After waiting for the enemy to get close enough, [Chen Yi] was the first to pull the trigger. The fire snake spewed out from the muzzle, and the next second, the bullet pierced through the enemy's body, blood splattering everywhere.
1:46:27|1:46:40|Following the voice of the adjutant, the scene shifted to the front line of the rebel army. Sure enough, under the command of [Qian Dajun], all soldiers of the Third Regiment were marching towards the position on foot. As the battle approached, [Zhu De] shouted,
1:46:40|1:46:48|In an instant, the guns on the entire front line kept firing. When the enemy got close enough, [Zhu De] seized the opportunity and shouted again. Hearing the command,
1:46:50|1:46:56|The soldier threw the grenade without hesitation, and the explosion instantly engulfed the enemy troops charging ahead.
1:46:59|1:47:11|Seeing the machine gunner being killed by the enemy's grenade, [Zhu De] felt both distressed and anxious, shouting for someone to take over. [Lin Biao], who had just rushed back to the front line, happened to witness this scene and did not dare to pause for a moment.
1:47:11|1:47:23|Leading the soldiers, [Zhu De] ran non-stop to the tunnel to operate the machine gun. As the commander, [Zhu De] also picked up a rifle to cover [Lin Biao] who was reloading, countless enemy soldiers trying to take advantage of the situation and rush into the position.
1:47:23|1:47:34|All were accurately shot dead by him. When all the machine guns opened fire again, the enemy forces that had just pushed forward with great effort were forced to retreat, leaving only the ground covered with blood and corpses.
1:47:34|1:47:39|The casualties were so staggering that [Qian Dajun] had to order the three regiments to halt their attack first.
1:47:39|1:47:45|In the Longhukeng battlefield, [Chen Yi] also repelled a group of enemy troops and is now cleaning up the battlefield.
1:48:2|1:48:10|After the Third Division retreated, [Zhu De] also commanded the cleaning of the battlefield during the war. The trenches were filled with bodies, blood soaking into the soil inside and out.
1:48:24|1:48:33|Looking at the battlefield, which was already riddled with holes, and the soldiers who were cleaning up the battlefield with dirty faces, [Zhu De] fell into contemplation.
1:48:33|1:48:37|Finally, [Mao Zedong] made a difficult and risky decision.
1:48:37|1:48:44|At night, as darkness fell over Sanheba, a small group of armed soldiers of the uprising were fully equipped under the moonlight.
1:48:44|1:48:56|[Zhu De], [Chen Yi], and others are tying hand grenades to themselves. When they are fully equipped, [Zhu De] and the other generals take a step back and watch as the young soldiers in front of them salute solemnly.
1:48:56|1:49:19|The scene shifts, and the time is early morning on the third day. Soldiers in full gear emerge from the icy river, their soaked clothes sticking to their bodies. Despite the cold wind causing ripples in the river, these soldiers seem oblivious to the piercing cold, their eyes fixed firmly on their target - the command post of [Qian Dajun] under the flag of the Kuomintang on the opposite bank.
1:49:19|1:49:25|They cautiously rushed into the tent, but exclaimed in surprise.
1:49:26|1:49:35|Just as the soldiers were at a loss, a sudden burst of gunfire rang outside the tent. The next second, bullets pierced through the canvas, ruthlessly nailing the soldiers.
1:49:35|1:49:43|The 8 brave warriors without cover were instantly riddled with bullets, their bodies full of holes, lying stiffly on the floor.
1:49:43|1:49:48|The lurking Nationalist Army immediately moved forward and surrounded the command post.
1:49:55|1:50:4|Ultimately died under the gun of [Qian Dajun], it's a pity for the fearless and selfless warrior, all the passionate blood turned into a gentle breeze.
1:51:32|1:51:38|The alternating shouts on the battlefield are calling upon every soldier.
1:51:47|1:52:4|[Cai Qingchuan] pushed [Chen Yi] and roared at him to follow the main force to retreat. [Zhu De] looked fearless in front of him, and the passionate soldiers were deeply moved. He took off his military cap, removed the Kuomintang emblem on it, and threw it on the ground fiercely. The soldiers followed suit one after another.
1:52:4|1:52:15|And so, countless Blue Sky White Sun badges were discarded, and a military force that belonged entirely to the Communist Party of China was born at that moment.
1:52:21|1:52:29|[Zhu De] tightly held [Cai Qingchuan]'s hand and said this. Then, with moist eyes, he walked up to the high ground, saluting like the brave warriors marching in the rear.
1:52:30|1:52:42|As [Zhu De] swung his right arm and placed his palm steadily on the side of his temple, the soldiers inside the position all saluted solemnly, including the wounded who couldn't stand and those who had lost their arms.
1:52:42|1:52:52|Countless scars, yet the figure stands tall on Sanheba, looking from afar, resembling the Great Wall on the mudflat, majestic and imposing.
1:52:52|1:53:4|The battle is about to begin. Even the warriors who have experienced bloody battles cannot help but shed tears when facing the separation of life and death. They embrace each other in farewell, releasing their pain and sorrow.
1:53:4|1:53:16|At the same time, he gritted his teeth and waited resentfully for [Qian Dajun] to arrive. On this side of the river, soldiers shed unparalleled blood, forging a military spirit with unwavering loyalty. On the other side of the river,
1:53:16|1:53:22|The Iron Cavalry is pressing forward, the blue sky and white sun covered in dust.
1:53:38|1:53:55|The order to defend was about to be announced. The 200 rebel soldiers left behind to hold the line each took ammunition, pulled the fuses, placed bombs all over the position, and finally stepped into the trench, ready to fight to the death, calmly facing the oncoming enemy.
1:53:55|1:54:12|Not long after, the enemy's 32nd Army approached the rebel positions. Faced with tens of thousands of well-equipped troops, not a single one of the 200 soldiers fled in the face of the enemy. They knew they carried the heavy burden of uniting the country, and behind them lay the lifeblood and backbone of China.
1:54:12|1:54:27|Watching the enemy forces continuously surging towards the battlefield, he knew that once the war started, the brutal enemy would charge forward like mad dogs and tear them to pieces.
1:54:27|1:54:38|He knew that no matter what, he and the 200 soldiers would be buried in Sanheba today, but even so, his hands remained steady on the machine gun handle.
1:54:38|1:54:48|At the moment when the enemy troops entered the firing range, he pulled the trigger. The bullets gushing out of the muzzle seemed to be the sorrow of Cai Qingchuan losing his comrades-in-arms and the long-suppressed anger.
1:54:48|1:54:58|At this moment, finally able to vent on the enemy, 200 soldiers fired with all their might, shooting down every enemy daring to invade the position.
1:54:58|1:55:8|When the bullets ran out, [Zhu De] drew the large knife from his back and charged out of the trench to hack at the enemy. When the blade dulled, he swung his fists to knock down the enemy and engage in hand-to-hand combat.
1:55:8|1:55:10|If hit by a bullet and unable to move,
1:55:47|1:56:2|He gradually came to his senses and saw Sun Shucheng, who was on the verge of death, constantly gesturing with his hands. Following the direction of his fingers, he saw a detonator.
1:56:7|1:56:20|The soldier named [Liu Song] has lost consciousness, but he is still moving towards the detonator, swaying slowly yet fearlessly and resolutely. When the enemy notices, they immediately raise their guns and shoot Liu Song down.
1:56:20|1:56:36|Witnessing the scene, [Cai Qingchuan] bravely pushed his broken body forward, disregarding everything, and lunged towards the detonator. After being shot again, he finally lost the strength to stand up, falling to the ground. He used his pistol to shoot at the enemies around him, and with all his might, he rolled over to embrace the detonator in his arms.
1:56:36|1:57:2|At this moment, he was completely out of strength. He threw away the pistol, rolled behind the sandbags with the detonator, gritted his teeth, pressed the detonation switch. The explosives placed in various corners of the position were immediately awakened, starting from the central position where [Cai Qingchuan] was, and quickly spreading across the entire battlefield. Countless explosives almost lifted the entire ground, soil and flesh rushing into the air, mixed with debris and sand and stones falling heavily.
1:57:2|1:57:20|The huge explosion caused the river to surge, the mountains to shake, and two hundred soldiers to sacrifice heroically. The green hills, the misty haze, the heroes buried on the river dam, brave in a hundred battles, the iron army, blood and tears flowing for four thousand miles.
1:57:22|1:57:28|On the mountain path, more than 2000 soldiers turned around to look towards the Three River Dam position where a deafening explosion was heard.
1:57:28|1:57:39|[Zhu De] was also in tears, his clothes stained with tears. He trembled his lips, wanting to say something, but it was stuck in his throat. He slowly raised his right arm again, paying tribute to those sacrificed comrades.
1:57:42|1:58:3|The scene shifts to Sanheba, and after the explosion subsides, [Qian Dajun] finally achieves his goal of occupying the position with his troops. Looking at the scorched earth of Sanheba, the battlefield filled with flames and smoke, and the rebel soldiers who are fearless despite wearing the uniforms of the Nationalist Army, [Qian Dajun] couldn't help but look serious.
1:58:3|1:58:14|He didn't know what was supporting [Cai Qingchuan] to pledge to live or die with the position, even at the cost of using his own body to block the enemy's advance. He couldn't help but wonder,
1:58:14|1:58:23|If he were assigned such a task, would he be able to go to such lengths? Too afraid to think further, he could only say to his adjutant beside him.
1:58:26|1:58:34|He took off his military cap and threw it into the trench, seemingly expressing regret for the loss of such an iron army in the civil war.
1:58:34|1:58:41|As time passed with the cold river water flowing slowly, the scene shifted to Raoping, Guangdong after many days.
1:58:41|1:58:49|[Su Yu] and Peng Yuanhua led a small team of soldiers to Maoshi Village to search for the main force of the army.
1:59:54|2:0:11|Upon hearing this, [Zhu De] and others were somewhat dazed, while [Lin Biao] even twisted his neck and couldn't hold back his tears. After a long while of calming down, he took off [Su Yu]'s military cap and removed the Kuomintang emblem from the top.
2:1:29|2:1:56|While the revolutionary army was constantly honing themselves in the flames of war, forging their iron will, in the city of Nanjing, [Jiang Jieshi] felt that the overall situation was already determined. He believed that those in the Communist Party whom he had once feared were now struggling to survive. Therefore, he began early preparations for his wedding with [Song Meiling]. As he tidied up his crisp tailcoat, he said.
2:2:55|2:3:3|In the confident back view of [Chiang Kai-shek] and [Soong Mei-ling], the scene gradually fades away, arriving at the residence of [Zhou Enlai] who is recuperating in Hong Kong.
2:3:3|2:3:28|After the Nanchang Uprising, [Zhou Enlai] led his troops south to Guangdong. Due to continuous warfare and numerous affairs, he became seriously ill with typhoid fever. He had to move to Hong Kong for treatment. Comrade Fan Guixia, who was responsible for taking care of his daily life, had just finished cooking the medicinal soup. As soon as she entered the living room, she saw [Zhou Enlai] wearing a coat and burning secret letters. She quickly spoke up.
2:4:46|2:4:52|[Zhu De] led his soldiers to arrive at Jinggangshan.
2:5:0|2:5:9|[He Changgong] excitedly informed everyone of the news, [Mao Zedong] heard it and was extremely thrilled, rushing with the soldiers and civilians of Jinggangshan to meet [Zhu De] halfway up the mountain.
2:5:34|2:5:43|Upon finishing speaking, [Mao Zedong]'s expression suddenly turned serious as he looked at the fluttering banners around him and the youthful yet powerful faces.
2:5:48|2:5:57|[Mao Zedong]'s boldness completely infected all the soldiers and civilians present, they cheered together, their hearts filled with longing for the future.
2:5:58|2:6:4|Seeing [Su Yu] leading [Lin Biao], Chen Yi, and others saluting to him, [Mao Zedong] spoke.
2:6:8|2:6:20|Having received the affirmation and expectations from [Mao Zedong], everyone was extremely excited. They embraced each other and shouted recklessly. The meeting at Jinggang Mountain greatly struck the arrogant arrogance of the reactionary Kuomintang.
2:6:20|2:6:35|Preserved a large number of steadfast political and military cadres of the Red Army, gathered the essence of armed forces on the Hunan-Jiangxi border, and strengthened the armed forces of the revolutionary base areas, which has extremely profound significance in the history of the Chinese revolution.
2:6:35|2:6:50|The scene gradually fades away in the warm atmosphere after the meeting, and then a line of text gradually appears in the darkness, dedicating this film to the 90th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
