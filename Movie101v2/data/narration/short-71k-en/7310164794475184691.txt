0:1:1|0:1:8|Their father, Shi Feng, walked in the light rain, tightly holding onto the handle of the cart, leading the children along the lush country path into the city.
0:1:8|0:1:19|Father and his two children arrived at the bustling town. They stopped at an intersection, and the father turned around, picking up the two children from the cart one by one. The children stood at the intersection holding umbrellas.
0:1:22|0:1:27|The two children, without the supervision of their father, stood at the intersection, looking a bit bored.
0:1:27|0:1:31|They mumbled for a while and then ran off to play with umbrellas.
0:1:31|0:1:39|After a while, Shi Feng's father returned with a cart. He looked around, but there was no sign of the two boys at the intersection. Anxiously, he asked the vendors by the roadside.
0:1:49|0:1:57|The father, who was at a loss after getting no answers, turned the cart around and headed back the way they came to search.
0:1:57|0:2:4|Meanwhile, the two children were walking hand in hand at the market. They saw a small stall selling chili peppers by the roadside and walked up to ask.
0:2:13|0:2:18|Upon hearing the vendor's words, the child imitated him and shook the chili seeds in his hand.
0:2:18|0:2:23|Shi Feng decided to stay in front of the chili stand, while Mu Lei went back to find his father.
0:2:23|0:2:26|On the other side, the father returned to that intersection and suddenly saw [Xiao Feng's Mom] running towards him.
0:2:36|0:2:39|The father, sweating profusely, followed [Xiao Feng's Mom] as they ran forward in a hurry.
0:2:39|0:2:42|Just as he ran out of the alley, he collided head-on with a truck.
0:2:42|0:2:48|The driver got out of the car quickly to check the situation after hitting someone.
0:2:59|0:3:12|On the other side, [Zhao Gang] stood with his head down in front of the chili stand. He listened to the vendor's words, looked at the chili seeds in his hand without saying anything, and then clenched his fist again.
0:3:12|0:3:18|On the other side, the father who was in a car accident remained unconscious and was rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment, with the situation looking grim.
0:3:18|0:3:20|At the same time, the vendor looked at [Zhao Gang] and asked,
0:4:5|0:4:11|[Zhao Gang] at this moment, looked like a successful career person, took out sunglasses from his pocket and went upstairs.
0:4:39|0:4:42|[Zhao Gang] rubbed his head and waved his big hand, saying,
0:4:42|0:4:52|Rest assured, my speed will be faster than you can imagine. Upon hearing this, the bosses exchanged a silent glance before finally speaking.
0:4:52|0:4:54|In another scene of [Beautiful Scenery].
0:5:6|0:5:7|The village chief calls [Mu Lei].
0:5:12|0:5:18|He has been working hard in the fields for the past two years.
0:5:18|0:5:29|From the beginning as a bookish village official whose ideas were all wrong, to now having already developed a whole set of experience in ecological agriculture.
0:6:22|0:6:28|[Mu Lei] looked at the approaching [Xiao Feng] with a smile of welcome, extending his hand and saying with a smile.
0:6:28|0:6:46|But he didn't notice that his hands were covered in chili powder, [Xiao Feng] also didn't notice. After shaking hands, she rubbed her eyes, getting chili powder in them. Her eyes couldn't open due to the spiciness, and she started crying from the irritation. It was only then that [Mu Lei] realized, lowering his head to look at his hands, realizing they were covered in chili powder.
0:6:53|0:7:7|The man beside him was still puzzled. Mu Lei realized what was happening, and quickly ran to the side of the field, pulled out some grass, crushed it in his hand, and smeared it all over Xiao Feng's face.
0:7:7|0:7:10|On the other side, Zhao Gang's father held a photo of Xiao Feng and said.
0:7:18|0:7:22|[Zhao Gang] took the photo with a smile, touched his head, and confidently said.
0:7:49|0:7:53|After [Zhao Gang] finished speaking, [Mu Lei] put on his sunglasses and left stylishly.
0:7:53|0:7:56|On the other side, [Xiao Feng] returned home in tears.
0:9:9|0:9:13|[Mu Lei] said nothing, turned around and walked into the house, slamming the door shut.
0:9:13|0:9:19|Mu Lei's girlfriend Lily watched as Mu Lei walked away, feeling so angry that she was gasping for breath. The two of them parted ways like this.
0:9:19|0:9:25|On the other side, [Zhao Gang] swaggered out of the company gate with sunglasses on, and opened the door of a car.
0:9:28|0:9:31|[Zhao Gang] takes out a photo.
0:9:43|0:9:49|Speak up, the two then drove to Tiemen Town, while on the other side, Mu Lei arrived at Xiao Feng's house.
0:9:49|0:9:58|Shi Xiaofeng walked to the door and saw the person standing there, then widened her eyes, closed the door, and turned back.
0:9:58|0:10:3|Having finished the last bite of his meal, [Mu Lei] rubbed his head in frustration, recalling his experience with [Xiao Feng] at the bookstore.
0:10:19|0:10:26|Mu Lei rushed over to grab the book and started flipping through it when he heard this. Xiao Feng patted his shoulder and said:
0:10:34|0:10:38|[Xiao Feng] didn't even look up at [Mu Lei], she turned around and walked away in anger.
0:10:38|0:10:42|At this moment, Mu Lei, who was immersed in the book, finally realized it and quickly caught up.
0:10:42|0:10:47|The boss lady behind him saw him holding a book and followed him out.
0:10:47|0:10:58|At this moment, [Zhao Gang], who was sleeping in the car, happened to pass by.
0:10:58|0:11:1|Suddenly, the driver San, who was busy watching the excitement, crashed into [Xiao Feng].
0:11:8|0:11:10|In the hospital, [Xiao Feng's Mom] came.
0:11:28|0:11:32|Mu Lei rummaged through his pockets and pulled out a few banknotes, saying to him.
0:11:50|0:11:52|[Mu Lei] took the money and left.
0:11:55|0:12:5|At this moment, [Mu Lei] is walking downstairs with a large package on his back. He takes out his phone and dials a number, putting it to his ear as he waits for the other party to answer.
0:12:22|0:12:32|Time goes back to now, [Xiao Feng] comes to the window on the second floor, quietly looks down at [Mu Lei], then sneaks out with a big basin of water in hand, and pours it down on [Mu Lei] below.
0:12:36|0:12:55|Mu Lei, who was drenched in water, let out a scream that alerted Xiao Feng's mother.
0:12:55|0:12:59|The two reached an agreement and split up, with [Xiao Feng's Mom] going downstairs to bring [Mu Lei] back home.
0:16:28|0:16:43|The old man held up the sickle in front of [San'er], while [Zhao Gang] stood not far away. The old man looked at a face that was exactly like [Mu Lei]'s.
0:16:43|0:16:49|[Xiao Feng] and his companions arrived in the field, [Mu Lei] is really a reliable and capable young man.
0:17:7|0:17:9|[Zhao Gang] paced back and forth at home after returning.
0:17:46|0:17:52|However, it is said that their relationship was not particularly good when they were in the army.
0:18:23|0:18:28|[Zhao Gang] rubbed his head in frustration, while the person they referred to as [Xiao Feng] was troubled by blind dates.
0:18:42|0:18:52|[Xiao Feng] nodded, picked up the costume and examined it carefully, then suddenly her eyes lit up as if she remembered something joyful, and she smiled contentedly at the costume.
0:18:52|0:18:57|Before long, [Xiao Feng] swaggered into the restaurant in a bulky and unattractive costume.
0:19:0|0:19:7|In order to avoid being noticed by the other party, [Shi Xiaofeng] went to great lengths. When the waiter looked at him in surprise, he felt even happier.
0:19:7|0:19:14|On the other side, [Zhao Gang] actually came up with [Xiao Feng], with a big beard on his face, dressed strangely to avoid blind dates.
0:19:23|0:19:29|Xiao Feng opened the door, widened her eyes, and acted as if she had entered the Grand View Garden like Liu Laolao, then burst into a silly smile.
0:19:29|0:19:38|Xiao Feng casually found a chair to sit down, deliberately using the oversized sleeves to wipe his nose, then swung his arms around and yawned loudly without any grace.
0:19:38|0:19:42|Zhao Gang stood in disbelief as he looked at the image of Xiao Feng.
0:19:42|0:19:46|[Zhao Gang] had never seen such a scene before, his eyes widened, and he couldn't say a word.
0:19:46|0:19:52|Xiao Feng, upon seeing the situation, acted even more vigorously, yawning and wiping her nose, responding to whatever was thrown at her.
0:19:52|0:19:57|Xiao Feng rolled up her sleeves and grabbed the rice with her hands, looking like she hadn't eaten in eight hundred years.
0:19:57|0:20:0|Zhao Gang, who had regained his senses, also began his performance.
0:20:0|0:20:5|He picked up a big chicken leg and ate it greedily, not even noticing when his beard fell off.
0:20:22|0:20:27|After the blind date turmoil, [Zhao Gang] and [San'er] arrived at the building where Xiao Feng works, sitting in the car and peeking inside.
0:22:29|0:22:32|The crowd dispersed unhappily, and Xiao Feng rubbed his head and replied:
0:22:46|0:22:53|Speak up, [Lily] arrived at the field, sure enough, [Molly] was here, she walked up to [Little Lei].
0:23:3|0:23:6|[Mu Lei] remained silent, and at this moment [Xiao Feng] also walked over.
0:23:9|0:23:13|Mu Lei stood up and looked at Xiao Feng who walked through the field to his side.
0:24:17|0:24:22|[Xiao Feng] knocked the water bowl out of [Mu Lei]'s hand and walked halfway before turning back.
0:24:22|0:24:26|Upon hearing this, [Mu Lei] lowered his head and muttered a few words.
0:24:43|0:24:47|Lili stood there blankly, then turned around and walked away.
0:24:47|0:25:0|[Mu Lei] didn't chase after him, quietly picked up the bowl from the ground, and continued working.
0:25:0|0:25:5|[Zhao Gang] and [Xiao Feng]'s father walked to the preparation area, with [Xiao Feng]'s father looking around at the furnishings in the room.
0:26:34|0:26:37|Sun Li, a master with a frown on his face, asked.
0:28:27|0:28:29|On the other side, [Mu Lei] is still introducing the ecological field to people.
0:28:52|0:29:0|On the other side, [Shi Xiaofeng] dragged her heavy feet and walked into the house, looking exhausted, and slumped directly onto the sofa.
0:29:0|0:29:9|[Xiao Feng's Mom] handed her a glass of water, looking at her tired daughter with a face full of concern, couldn't help but speak.
0:29:27|0:29:38|Mu Lei, who was working, heard Xiao Feng's words, put down the basin in his hand, looked at Xiao Feng, sighed heavily, and then nodded with a worried expression on his face.
0:31:56|0:31:59|[Xiao Feng] was excited and stumbled, [Mu Lei] quickly caught her.
0:32:8|0:32:15|Returning to the city, Lily bumped into [Zhao Gang], mistaking him for [Mu Lei]. [Zhao Gang] shrugged and walked away without paying much attention.
0:32:15|0:32:22|Lily watched as [Zhao Gang] walked away, puzzled. Meanwhile, [Xiao Feng] and [Mu Lei] walked out with smiles on their faces.
0:32:35|0:32:39|The scene shifts, [San'er] is peeking through the crack of the door, watching [Mu Lei] and [Zhao Gang].
0:32:39|0:32:44|[Mu Lei] turned around and looked [Zhao Gang] up and down, then said.
0:33:23|0:33:27|[Zhao Gang] rubbed his head and waved his big hand, saying.
0:33:58|0:34:1|[Zhao Gang] sneered and stood up, saying.
0:34:5|0:34:10|A talent like you, [Zhao Gang], pulls up [Xiao Feng] beside him.
0:34:22|0:34:26|[Xiao Feng] glanced at [Mu Lei], then left. In the private room, only Lily and [Mu Lei] were left.
0:34:26|0:34:29|Lily looked puzzled.
0:34:29|0:34:35|[Mu Lei] frowned, remained silent, just staring at the back of [Zhao Gang], as if pondering something.
0:34:35|0:34:43|Returning home in the evening, [Mu Lei] took out a photo from the wardrobe and stared at it blankly. He slowly turned to his mother, who was approaching.
0:34:43|0:34:47|Mu Lei's Mom looked at Mu Lei with tears in her eyes.
0:35:29|0:35:35|The mother took the photo from [Mu Lei]'s hand and gently wiped it with a cloth, both of them teared up for a moment.
0:35:53|0:35:57|[Mu Lei] choked up and blinked his moist eyes before turning around and leaving.
0:35:57|0:36:1|Mu Lei's Mom looked at the photo in her hand, missing him like a flood rushing in.
0:36:1|0:36:8|Tears had already filled her face, she wiped away the tears at the corner of her eyes, her gaze never leaving the person in the photo.
0:36:8|0:36:14|She turned around, reluctant to put her husband's memorial photo back into the wardrobe, then took out a small box from inside.
0:36:15|0:36:21|The mother stared at the box for a moment, then carefully placed it on the table.
0:36:21|0:36:32|At that moment, the mother seemed to have aged ten years in an instant, hunching over to open the box held by [Mu Lei's Mom]. Inside the box was also a photo, which prominently displayed a family portrait of the four of them from years ago.
0:36:35|0:36:42|The next morning, [Li Li] arrived in front of a tall building. She looked up and saw that the building in front of her was the company of [Zhao Gang]'s father.
0:36:42|0:36:45|[Lili] went to [Zhao Gang]'s father's office and handed him a photo.
0:36:45|0:36:48|[Zhao Gang]'s father looked at the photo, as if pondering something.
0:37:55|0:38:2|[Zhao Gang]'s father looked at [Li Li] in confusion, then picked up the photo on the table and examined it carefully.
0:38:23|0:38:26|On the other side, [Zhao Gang] and [San'er] at home looked worried.
0:38:42|0:38:50|In the midst of the conversation, Zhao Gang's father returned. He stood at the door for a moment, then walked towards Zhao Gang with a serious expression on his face.
0:38:50|0:38:55|The two looked at each other, both troubled by their own worries, so neither of them spoke.
0:38:55|0:39:2|In the end, [Zhao Gang]'s father walked upstairs with his hands behind his back, while [San'er] watched him go upstairs and continued the previous conversation.
0:39:6|0:39:20|[San'er] was stunned for a moment, saluted, took an exaggerated step, and walked out.
0:39:20|0:39:23|The scene cuts to the village, where Lily is chatting with [Mu Lei's Mom].
0:40:3|0:40:5|Mu Lei's Mom paused for a moment upon hearing this, then smiled and did not respond.
0:40:28|0:40:30|"Say it, then carried the dumplings back into the house."
0:40:30|0:40:39|Li Li also stood up, clapped the flour off her hands, followed inside, and then brought out a basin of water from the house, walking towards the front door.
0:40:39|0:40:45|At this moment, [Mu Lei] was walking home with a book in his hand and accidentally bumped into Lili who was pouring water out of the house.
0:40:45|0:40:47|Mu Lei looked at Li Li with a puzzled expression and asked.
0:41:6|0:41:18|Watching [Mu Lei] and [Xiao Feng], Lili felt jealous, she picked up the basin in her hand and poured all the water on [Mu Lei], then put the basin on [Mu Lei]'s head, and walked home angrily.
0:41:18|0:41:20|[Xiao Feng's Mom] saw it and burst into laughter.
0:41:20|0:41:25|[Mu Lei] took down the basin, with a green vegetable still hanging on his head, and grinned foolishly.
0:41:25|0:41:28|At the dining table, Li Li stared at [Mu Lei] intently.
0:41:28|0:41:32|Xiao Feng glared angrily at Li Li, while [Mu Lei] stood by silently watching the two of them.
0:41:32|0:41:35|Mu Lei's Mom witnessed it and quickly intervened, saying.
0:41:37|0:41:45|[Lily] picked up a dumpling for [Mu Lei], intending to give it to Xiao Feng, but then handed it to [Mu Lei's Mom].
0:41:45|0:41:56|Mu Lei handed a dumpling to Xiao Feng, and Mu Lei's Mom, seeing this, also handed one to Lily.
0:41:56|0:41:58|The dumpling battle is over, Xiao Feng and [Mu Lei] are walking on the road.
0:42:33|0:42:36|A speeding car came to a stop in front of them.
0:42:36|0:42:40|The car door opens, and Xiao Feng gasps at the person coming down.
0:42:41|0:42:44|[Zhao Gang] closed the car door and walked up to the two of them.
0:43:35|0:43:39|Xiao Feng looked at Mu Lei, who was talking confidently, with admiration. Mu Lei continued speaking.
0:44:12|0:44:18|[Zhao Gang] finished speaking, then pulled Xiao Feng over. Xiao Feng glanced at [Mu Lei], then followed Zhao Gang over. Mu Lei quickly shouted.
0:44:21|0:44:39|Mu Lei watched the two of them get into the car with longing eyes. The car quickly started, leaving Mu Lei standing there in a daze, looking at the departing figures with a face full of sadness but also helplessness. The car drove into the city, and Zhao Gang parked the car by the roadside. Xiao Feng got out of the car, followed closely by Zhao Gang.
0:45:38|0:45:43|On the other side, [Mu Lei] rubbed his hands and walked home with a heavy heart.
0:45:43|0:45:50|He didn't notice that there was a Land Rover parked on the side of the road, and the person in the car was watching him. The person who came was none other than [Zhao Gang]'s father.
0:45:50|0:45:52|The scene shifts to Xiao Feng and [Zhao Gang].
0:46:21|0:46:27|[Zhao Gang] looked at the contract, nodded silently, and said.
0:47:55|0:48:1|[Zhao Gang]'s father took out a photo from his bag and handed it to [Mu Lei's Mom].
0:48:1|0:48:4|Mu Lei's Mom took the photo and was stunned at first sight.
0:48:4|0:48:10|In the photo is a family of three, [Zhao Gang] looking at a face that is exactly like [Mu Lei]'s, trembling with excitement.
0:48:10|0:48:15|She looked at Zhao Gang's father with a photo in her hand, opened her mouth, and hesitated to speak.
0:48:15|0:48:21|She carefully looked at the photo, tears streaming down her face, trembling hands, cautiously feeling the photo.
0:48:21|0:48:34|Excitedly, [Zhao Gang]'s father stood up and walked into the room. Looking at the woman who was crying tears of joy in front of him, he felt a wave of doubt in his heart. He fanned the fan in his hand, as if this could erase the worries in his heart.
0:48:34|0:48:39|Before long, [Mu Lei's Mom] came out holding a box containing a family photo of the four of them.
0:48:41|0:48:46|He took out a photo, carefully wiped it on his body, and handed it to [Zhao Gang]'s father.
0:48:46|0:48:54|Zhao Gang's father quickly put down the fan, took the photo with a smile, and looked at it, also stunned in place.
0:48:54|0:49:0|He put two photos together, comparing them, and slowly furrowed his brow. He muttered to himself.
0:49:6|0:49:9|He spoke and handed two photos to [Mu Lei's Mom].
0:49:27|0:49:31|Upon hearing this, Mu Lei's Mom knelt down in front of him.
0:49:41|0:49:56|He quickly helped up [Mu Lei's Mom], the woman sitting on the stool holding a photo, as if holding a long-lost child, repeatedly looking at the photo in her hands, never getting enough of it, as if trying to make up for decades of longing.
0:49:56|0:50:1|Zhao Gang's father also fanned for him, looking at this scene, eventually also lost his eyes.
0:50:10|0:50:19|Unaware of the situation, [Zhao Gang] arrived at the village wearing sunglasses, walking sneakily while looking around, afraid of being discovered by others.
0:50:19|0:50:28|Approaching the gate, he stood still and peered inside quietly. Suddenly, a hand slapped him hard on the back, making [Zhao Gang] jump in fright and look back nervously.
0:50:37|0:50:42|Xiao Feng happened to pass by, watching the two fighting, pouting and walking away.
0:51:30|0:51:35|Mu Lei's Mom, upon hearing this, pushed Lily aside and hurriedly walked out.
0:51:35|0:51:37|Lily saw the situation and ran after them.
0:51:37|0:51:49|Mu Lei's Mom walked along the road to the outskirts of the village, looking left and right, her face filled with anxiety. But fate did not comply with her wishes, and she still did not see her long-lost son.
0:51:49|0:51:51|On the other side, Mu Lei arrived at Xiao Feng's home.
0:52:28|0:52:30|[Mu Lei] smiled faintly and said nothing.
0:52:37|0:52:40|Upon hearing this, Xiao Feng's parents exchanged a glance.
0:53:12|0:53:19|Xiao Feng's parents looked at the two who came in and out together, feeling a bit puzzled for a moment. [Xiao Feng's Mom] asked in confusion.
0:53:27|0:53:30|Late at night, [Mu Lei's Mom] and [Uncle Chen] sat together.
0:53:56|0:54:17|After listening to Uncle Chen's analysis, Mu Lei's Mom looked at the photos borrowed from Uncle Chen in silence for a long time, and finally sighed.
0:54:17|0:54:25|The scene shifts, and [Zhao Gang] returns home. Upon hearing these words, [Zhao Gang]'s father freezes, hesitates for a moment, sets down the newspaper in his hand, and turns to look at [Zhao Gang].
0:54:48|0:54:54|Upon hearing this, [Zhao Gang] became afraid and dared not seek the truth. He turned around to head upstairs, but stopped halfway.
0:54:54|0:54:55|[Zhao Gang] sat slouched on the sofa, looking at his father. His father put down the newspaper in his hand and patted his shoulder.
0:55:54|0:56:0|[Zhao Gang] waved his hand to leave, but as he stood up, a roar from his father made him stop in his tracks.
0:56:0|0:56:5|The father walked up behind [Zhao Gang], looking at his back, and slowly spoke.
0:56:23|0:56:27|Upon hearing these words, [Zhao Gang] hesitated for a moment, then stormed out of the house with a look of sorrow and indignation.
0:56:27|0:56:30|Angry [Zhao Gang] found [San'er].
0:57:24|0:57:28|Mu Lei heard the news and quickly walked towards [Uncle Lao Chen]'s house.
0:57:28|0:57:33|In the courtyard, [Mu Lei] shells peanuts while watching [Uncle Lao Chen] sitting across from him.
0:58:5|0:58:6|Uncle Lao Chen turned around and pointed at Mu Lei, saying.
0:58:34|0:58:36|"Speak up," [Mu Lei] walked angrily towards the door and locked the door of [Uncle Lao Chen]'s house.
1:0:25|1:0:29|Upon hearing this, [Zhao Gang] was momentarily speechless, pursed his lips, and said nothing.
1:0:59|1:1:2|On the other side, Mu Lei's Mom is anxiously waiting.
1:1:22|1:1:27|Mu Lei's Mom sat nervously in a chair, while Xiao Feng's Mom brought out several pots from the house.
1:2:56|1:3:3|[Xiao Feng] pushed [Mu Lei's Mom], and she finally came to her senses from her daze.
1:3:3|1:3:6|On the other side, [Xiao Feng's Dad] arrived at [Zhao Gang]'s father's office.
1:3:54|1:3:56|After saying this, [Li Li] lowered her head.
1:3:56|1:4:2|Zhao Gang's father was stunned when he heard this, and he glanced at Shi Feng's father.
1:4:2|1:4:6|On the other side, [Zhao Gang] sitting in the office seemed lost in thought.
1:4:16|1:4:27|Upon hearing this, [Zhao Gang] snapped out of it, looked at [San'er], remained silent for a moment, picked up the sunglasses on the table, then stood up, grabbed the bag and hat, and walked out briskly.
1:4:27|1:4:34|San'er saw Zhao Gang sigh and leave the house, quickly walked to Zhao Gang's study, wanting to know what was troubling him.
1:4:34|1:4:40|At this sight, [San'er] was dumbfounded, never expecting to see Xiao Feng's photo on the computer screen of [Zhao Gang].
1:4:40|1:4:44|On the other side, [Xinghua] was sitting anxiously in Xiao Feng's house.
1:5:8|1:5:13|Don't be fooled by their identical looks, one is in the sky and the other is underground.
1:6:4|1:6:12|After Xiaofeng finished speaking, he left angrily, leaving behind his father with a helpless look on his face. The next moment, he arrived in the village with [Zhao Gang].
1:6:19|1:6:23|Suddenly, [Zhao Gang] reached out and held Xiao Feng's hand, but Xiao Feng quickly pulled away.
1:6:56|1:6:59|Mu Lei sat down and started stringing chili peppers with his mother.
1:7:38|1:7:45|Upon hearing his son's question, he froze for a moment, stopped his work, then smiled and said to [Mu Lei].
1:8:1|1:8:9|Speak up, [Mu Lei's Mom] thought of Zhao Gang's recent situation, as if letting go of her worries, she smiled, wiped away her tears, and continued with her work.
1:8:9|1:8:18|Mu Lei, who could hear these words, felt a sense of discomfort in his heart. He turned his head without saying a word, slowly stopped his actions, and tears fell down his cheeks unnoticed.
1:8:19|1:8:27|He stood up and silently walked towards the room. When he reached the door, he hesitated and stopped, but in the end, he didn't say anything.
1:8:28|1:8:37|Mu Lei's Mom watched as Mu Lei walked into the room, then took out a box from beside the sofa and carefully examined the photo given to him by Zhao Gang's father.
1:8:37|1:8:47|Back in the room, Mu Lei opened the drawer, took out a small hat, and held it in his hand, looking at it quietly, lost in thought. Suddenly, his mother's voice interrupted his thoughts.
1:9:37|1:9:53|[Mu Lei] looked helplessly at [Mu Lei's Mom], his face full of grievances. He sighed heavily, then turned around and took out the small hat from the drawer, looking at the hat and said to [Mu Lei's Mom].
1:10:3|1:10:13|You... [Mu Lei] threw the hat into the drawer, turned stubbornly, tears already covering his face, but he did not back down from this matter.
1:10:13|1:10:20|On the other side, [Zhao Gang] was sitting alone on the sofa, curled up, with the sunlight shining on his face, suddenly waking him up.
1:10:20|1:10:26|He sat up, leaning back on the sofa with his eyes tightly closed, as if suddenly remembering something.
1:10:26|1:10:40|Suddenly opened his eyes, then got up and walked to the ecological field, looking at the vast fields in front of him, feeling the sweet breeze of nature brushing his cheeks, and listening to the chirping of birds around him.
1:10:40|1:10:47|He stood there quietly, feeling everything, his heart at this moment experiencing an unparalleled tranquility.
1:10:47|1:10:50|On the other side, [Xiao Feng's Mom] and [Mu Lei] were pacing anxiously at home.
1:11:30|1:11:34|[Xiao Feng's Mom] didn't listen to her father and ran out with [Mu Lei].
1:12:55|1:12:59|[Xiao Feng's Mom] closed the door and as soon as she entered the room, [Zhao Gang] immediately pressed his ear against the door.
1:12:59|1:13:3|[Xiao Feng's Mom] was also in the room, pressing her ear against the door, listening to the sounds outside.
1:13:3|1:13:7|She walked over, fidgeting, opened the door, and looked at [Zhao Gang] with a smile.
1:13:13|1:13:19|Seeing [Xiao Feng's Mom] smiling so sweetly at him, [Zhao Gang] burst into laughter and happily went to squeeze juice.
1:13:23|1:13:32|Meanwhile, in the room, [Xiao Feng's Mom] took the opportunity while [Zhao Gang] was away, sneaking over to [Zhao Gang]'s clothes rack and started picking out his clothes.
1:13:32|1:13:45|She looked left and right, shook her head feeling unsatisfied, finally picked up a suit and examined it carefully. She imagined the scene in her mind, smiled with satisfaction, then carefully took it off, hugged it gently.
1:13:54|1:14:4|Xiao Feng took the opportunity while the two were talking and slipped away with the stolen suit.
1:14:51|1:14:55|On the other side, [Zhao Gang] disguised himself as [Mu Lei] to meet with the investors.
1:15:17|1:15:21|Mu Lei, feeling restless, suddenly stood up and walked outside.
1:15:26|1:15:33|He pushed open the door, walked out with big strides, wiping the sweat off his head as he went, while on the other side, [Zhao Gang] suddenly stood up.
1:15:37|1:15:45|[Zhao Gang] and [San Er] walked towards the door, and at that moment, [Mu Lei] happened to pass by. They once again brushed past each other, and the waiter at the door came over and said.
1:15:51|1:15:57|[San'er] followed the waiter to move the car, leaving [Zhao Gang] alone at the door. He touched his head and walked towards the distance.
1:15:57|1:16:3|At this moment, Lily and [Secretary Niu] came down from upstairs and walked to the office door. Lily spoke first.
1:16:10|1:16:13|Lily was about to leave when she ran into [Mu Lei] walking towards her.
1:16:19|1:16:22|Mu Lei watched as Lily turned around and quickly slipped away.
1:16:22|1:16:31|Lily turned around and saw [Zhao Gang] coming out of the restroom.
1:16:48|1:16:52|On the other side, [Mu Lei] accidentally entered the investor's room.
1:16:52|1:16:57|He walked into the room, paused for a moment, and then sat down.
1:16:57|1:16:59|The investor in the ecological field asked when he saw the situation.
1:17:39|1:17:43|[Zhao Gang] just finished speaking and then slipped away.
1:17:43|1:17:47|He ran out of the door and entered the room of the aluminum mining investor.
1:17:47|1:17:52|At this moment, [Mu Lei] walked out of the ecotourism investor's room, standing at the doorway scratching his head in confusion.
1:17:55|1:18:0|The next moment, unaware [Mu Lei] was dragged in front of [Secretary Niu] by Lily.
1:18:42|1:18:45|And at this moment, [Zhao Gang] was sitting in the room of the aluminum ore investor.
1:19:12|1:19:20|After the end of this inexplicable conversation, [Zhao Gang] rolled his eyes, sensing that something was amiss, and walked out of the room fidgeting.
1:19:20|1:19:26|As he left, the suppliers looked at each other in confusion.
1:19:26|1:19:29|Zhao Gang, who left the house, arrived at the room of the ecological field supplier.
1:19:46|1:19:54|[Mu Lei] shook off [Xiao Li]'s hand, took big strides forward, paused at the door of the aluminum mine investor's office, and then walked in.
1:19:54|1:20:0|[Xiao Li] looked a bit puzzled, [Mu Lei] walked up to the developer, with a serious expression on his face.
1:20:24|1:20:27|At this moment, the two groups of people all gathered at the door.
1:20:27|1:20:30|[Xiao Feng's Mom] and [Secretary Niu] rushed forward when they saw the situation.
1:21:13|1:21:19|The silent aluminum ore investor with his back turned looked at the crowd and left angrily.
1:21:19|1:21:35|Zhao Gang watched as the frustrated investor stormed off, pointing at Mu Lei's nose and cursing.
1:21:35|1:21:37|Upon hearing Mu Lei's words, Xiao Feng smiled happily.
1:21:53|1:21:59|[Zhao Gang] furrowed his brow, adjusted his suit, turned his head to the side, and remained silent for a long time.
1:21:59|1:22:2|On the other side, back at home, [Xiao Feng] was in the kitchen preparing a meal.
1:22:2|1:22:4|Xiao Feng's Mom walked in.
1:22:32|1:22:38|Xiao Feng, carrying the meal she made herself, arrived at the field. Walking along the road, a happy smile was on her face.
1:22:38|1:22:40|She walked up to [Mu Lei] and said.
1:23:20|1:23:27|When it was time for the wedding, Xiao Feng couldn't bear it after hearing these words, so she angrily threw down the lunchbox and left.
1:23:27|1:23:34|Xiao Feng, who came to the city, walked desolately on the road after the fire, and happened to meet Zhao Gang who was just getting into the car.
1:23:34|1:23:40|Xiao Feng got into the car and sat in the passenger seat, then turned around and energetically called out to [Zhao Gang].
1:23:52|1:23:57|Thoughtful [Zhao Gang] turned his head after speaking, then sighed and stopped looking at him.
1:23:57|1:24:3|Xiao Feng, seeing him remain silent, then opened the car door and walked down, slamming the door shut hard.
1:24:3|1:24:7|Not leaving, just standing by the car window, staring at [Zhao Gang] with a look of grievance.
1:24:7|1:24:11|No sooner had he closed the car door than [Zhao Gang] started the car and drove away.
1:24:14|1:24:19|On the other side, [Mu Lei] hurriedly arrived at the hospital, and [Uncle Chen] greeted him.
1:24:43|1:24:49|Before long, the [doctor] came out with the test results, and [Mu Lei] quickly approached to inquire.
1:24:55|1:25:0|Hearing this, [Mu Lei] was so anxious that he broke out in a cold sweat and walked out in a daze.
1:25:0|1:25:3|Seeing [Uncle Chen] standing at the gate, he spoke.
1:25:13|1:25:24|Uncle Lao Chen looked [Mu Lei] up and down, carefully examining his face, then patted him and said.
1:25:24|1:25:43|[Mu Lei] finished speaking, and [Uncle Chen] was shocked, his eyes wide open. In the emergency room, [Zhao Gang] sat beside his mother, watching as the blood dripped into her body. Tears rolled down [Zhao Gang]'s cheeks like broken beads as he looked at his mother lying on the hospital bed. Lost in memories, he thought, "Twenty-seven years ago, when I first saw you."
1:26:16|1:26:18|[Zhao Gang] stopped and lowered his head.
1:26:18|1:26:24|Zhao Gang's father patted his shoulder, and neither of them spoke again.
1:26:24|1:26:30|The scene cuts back to the present, with [Zhao Gang] and [Mu Lei] standing by their mother's bedside. Suddenly, the nurse next to them speaks up.
1:26:38|1:26:50|The mother looked at her two sons on either side, with a happy smile on her face. She trembled as she reached out her hand and touched the heads of the two sons.
1:26:50|1:27:0|On the other side, [Xiao Feng's Mom] and her family sat on the sofa in silence. Xiao Feng was seen crying while grabbing food with her hands, stuffing it into her mouth as if she had been deeply affected by something.
1:27:0|1:27:3|Xinghua looked at her with a worried expression.
1:27:10|1:27:12|[Xiao Feng] burst into tears loudly.
1:27:33|1:27:36|One morning, [Zhao Gang]'s father came to the village, shouting from a distance.
1:28:12|1:28:13|He said it.
1:28:29|1:28:34|[Zhao Gang] looked at the silent parents of [Xiao Feng], and without hesitation, he picked it up and put it in his mouth.
1:28:34|1:28:43|Seeing [Mu Lei] grimacing in pain from the spiciness, [Xiao Feng] widened her eyes and couldn't help but laugh.
1:28:43|1:28:49|The scene shifts to a park.
1:29:5|1:29:11|Confused Lily was led by [Xiao Feng], chasing after the two brothers [Zhao Gang] and [Mu Lei] ahead.
1:29:11|1:29:14|Up to this moment, the few of them have turned their swords into gifts.
1:29:14|1:29:18|The grand battle between [Shi Feng] and [Mu Lei] comes to an end.
