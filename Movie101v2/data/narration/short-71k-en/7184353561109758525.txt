0:1:35|0:1:41|[Jennifer] is driving on the expressway, raising her right hand occasionally to take a few puffs of cigarette.
0:1:41|0:1:46|She came to the street stall, eating peanut cake with her head down, and there was also a bowl of noodles on the table.
0:1:46|0:1:50|Suddenly looking up, tears were already streaming down her face. 
0:1:50|0:1:53|The shop owner greeted her as soon as he saw her.
0:1:54|0:1:59|[Jennifer] approached the stall with a cigarette in hand, casually flipping through the items, as the shopkeeper added.
0:2:15|0:2:22|[Jennifer] listened quietly with her eyes downcast, picked up the cigarette and brought it to her lips, then blew out a puff of smoke.
0:2:24|0:2:38|Smoke billows out as the scene unfolds, her fluffy waves cascading down her shoulders. The screen gradually darkens, and the title appears from left to right: "Breakup or Not".
0:2:38|0:2:42|In the bright and spacious bathroom stall, [Zhuo Xiaolin] sat on the toilet seat with a dazed expression.
0:2:47|0:3:3|[Kouzi] looked at the apple phone in his hand, the screen showed that the caller was Tianyan. His fingers were painted with unique nail polish, anxiously touching the side of the phone. After a few seconds, the screen relaxed and his furrowed brow closed his eyes.
0:3:3|0:3:13|[Kouzi] took a deep breath, decided to turn off the screen, and buried her head in continued distress, clutching her hair.
0:3:34|0:3:37|The group led by [Zhuo Xiaolin] wore sunglasses and got on the nanny car.
0:4:1|0:4:9|Under gate 2 of the terminal, [Zhuo Xiaolin] walked out alone with sunglasses on, hands in pockets, walking briskly.
0:4:9|0:4:12|Night falls, he gets out of the taxi, silently reciting in his heart.
0:4:41|0:4:45|[Kouzi] stood by the fountain pool in the residential area.
0:4:45|0:4:50|The fountain suddenly started spraying water in the pond, and Zhuo Xiaolin looked at it and burst into laughter.
0:4:50|0:4:55|He gazed at the fountain and relaxed, his side-parted long hair covering his right ear.
0:4:55|0:4:58|On this side of the stall, [Zhuo Xiaolin] is typing on his laptop.
0:5:10|0:5:18|He typed the final period of the article, steam wafting around him, [Zhuo Xiaolin] with thick eyebrows and big eyes, wearing a high-necked cardigan.
0:5:18|0:5:23|This is an old stall selling beef noodle soup, where [Zhuo Xiaolin] loosened his muscles and shouted.
0:5:41|0:5:42|[The Engineer] drives home.
0:6:3|0:6:9|[Engineer] frowned upon hearing the news, while [Button] fell asleep on a bench in the neighborhood.
0:6:9|0:6:12|[Zhuo Xiaolin] slowly approached her, taking off the bag from his shoulder.
0:6:12|0:6:15|[The Engineer] looked slightly surprised at [Button].
0:6:22|0:6:25|Hamlet once wrote love letters to her.
0:6:38|0:6:47|In a blink of an eye, [Zhuo Xiaolin] was already standing in front of the round mirror in the bathroom, using a towel to dry his half-wet hair, with a photo of him smiling with [Jennifer] hanging on the wall.
0:6:47|0:6:57|[Button] lay on the bed wrapped in a towel, while the man used a hairdryer to blow dry his hair. The man gently stroked the stray hairs on [Button]'s forehead as he lay with his eyes closed on the man's lap.
0:6:57|0:7:5|The man drove out with [Zhuo Xiaolin], who sat in the passenger seat looking out at the street view. They arrived at a bar called Tide.
0:7:13|0:7:17|The long-haired girl in a checkered shirt sings softly on the stage.
0:7:17|0:7:23|In front of the stage, the man stared at [Button] and took a sip of wine, then he turned around and leaned against the stage, putting down the wine glass.
0:7:23|0:7:28|[Kouzi] sat in the seat next to him, supporting his forehead and looking towards the stage, memories flooding back.
0:7:44|0:7:49|[Kouzi] stood on the original stage of the bar singing, with cheers and applause from the audience below, creating a lively atmosphere.
0:7:49|0:7:54|Tianye sat in the corner, watching [Duoduo] on the stage with great interest.
0:7:54|0:7:59|At the end of the song, [Zhuo Xiaolin] blew a kiss to the audience, then smiled and hugged the guitarist beside her.
0:8:0|0:8:15|After the bar closed, the band members embraced [Zhuo Xiaolin] and walked out of the bar. After waving goodbye to them, [Zhuo Xiaolin] crossed the street and a man on a motorcycle picked him up and took him home. [Zhuo Xiaolin] sat behind him, holding onto his waist tightly.
0:8:15|0:8:26|In the bedroom hung the familiar crystal bead curtain, [Young Shopkeeper] leaned against the door frame, smiling and playing with the curtain. The man walked over, gently brushed the bead curtain, approached [Young Shopkeeper] with a smile, and gazed into his eyes.
0:8:27|0:8:33|The man lifted Zhuo Xiaolin's chin with his index finger, and Zhuo Xiaolin smiled sweetly, the two of them being very intimate.
0:8:33|0:8:37|The man is Zhuo Xiaolin's boyfriend, Duoduo.
0:8:37|0:8:42|Under the neon lights of the city at night, [Duoduo] returned to the new house with her boyfriend.
0:8:42|0:8:47|She rushed in and immediately helped her boyfriend push the suitcase into the room.
0:8:56|0:9:0|[Duoduo] changed into slippers, and her boyfriend collapsed on the bed in a sprawled position.
0:9:0|0:9:6|[Duoduo] squatted down with a smile, deftly helped him take off his shoes and neatly stored them away.
0:9:6|0:9:14|The boyfriend relaxedly looked up at the ceiling, and when [Duoduo] climbed onto him, he hugged and kissed her.
0:9:14|0:9:17|[Duoduo] eagerly lowered her head and kissed his lips.
0:9:17|0:9:22|After a while, [Duoduo] re-made the bed, arranged the pillows, and spread out the blanket.
0:9:29|0:9:34|He tucked his messy hair behind his ears and started wiping the floor with a cloth.
0:9:34|0:9:39|The boyfriend came out of the bathroom, leaving a trail of wet footprints on the freshly wiped wooden floor.
0:9:39|0:9:44|[Duoduo] hesitated for a moment, then half-knelt and carefully wiped away the water stains.
0:9:44|0:9:50|In the morning, [Duoduo] looked at the lace camisole in her hand, suddenly leaned on her boyfriend's chest and asked.
0:10:2|0:10:5|[Duoduo] looked up at the sky and sighed helplessly.
0:10:30|0:10:38|She pouted and lay down, and her boyfriend took the opportunity to hug her and put one leg over her.
0:10:38|0:10:42|[Duoduo] lay on her boyfriend's arm, lost in thought, and suddenly spoke up.
0:11:25|0:11:31|[Duoduo] walked up to the phone, looking somewhat surprised.
0:11:32|0:11:35|She blinked her eyes and listened quietly.
0:11:35|0:11:49|At night, there were many customers in front of the peanut cake shop.
0:11:49|0:11:56|[Kouzi] stood beside her sister [Duoduo], helping to take care of the business.
0:11:56|0:12:1|After closing the stall, Duoduo, Young Shopkeeper, Button, and Zhuo Xiaolin sat around the table by the roadside stall.
0:12:7|0:12:11|[Kouzi] ate noodles while feeling a bit awkward under the gaze of her sister.
0:12:11|0:12:16|[Duoduo] remained silent as she looked at her, while the two men observed the two sisters.
0:12:23|0:12:27|Behind the thick steam, [Duoduo] raised her hand to wipe away tears.
0:12:27|0:12:32|When they were young, [Duoduo] and [Button] sat by the roadside eating just like they do now.
0:12:32|0:12:39|[Duoduo] blew the tangyuan in the bowl to cool it down and fed it to [Button], the little braided [Button] laughed with eyes squinted.
0:12:39|0:12:43|Memories faded, [Zhuo Xiaolin] set down the bowl and tightly held [Duoduo]'s hand.
0:12:43|0:12:47|After eating, the four of them stood around chatting.
0:13:2|0:13:5|[Young Shopkeeper] pulls [Duoduo] away, while [Duoduo] carries a bag of pastries.
0:13:5|0:13:9|Back home, [Zhuo Xiaolin] acts for [Duoduo].
0:13:23|0:13:29|[Zhuo Xiaolin] pushed aside the pearl curtain and walked up to [Duoduo].
0:13:58|0:14:0|He knelt down and looked at [Duoduo] sitting on the edge of the bed.
0:14:12|0:14:15|[Zhuo Xiaolin] lies down on the bed.
0:14:15|0:14:19|The pants lay beside her.
0:14:47|0:14:51|There is a junior apprentice sister playing Ophelia.
0:15:21|0:15:27|[Button] closed his eyes, shook his head and fell silent, as if entering a dreamland.
0:15:27|0:15:32|[Zhuo Xiaolin] turned his head, lying on his back, his mind drifting far away. The two of them hugged each other and fell asleep peacefully.
0:15:46|0:15:56|[Kouzi] snuggled up to Xiaolin in her sleep, with his long legs resting on hers, the sunlight shining on the soles of their feet, the sweet dream continuing.
0:15:56|0:16:5|The sun was shining warmly as the band with unique makeup performed on the steps of the square, while a young photographer enthusiastically took pictures of them.
0:16:5|0:16:12|Suddenly, his camera captured [Jennifer] smoking, taking several shots in a row. [Jennifer] in the footage looked confident and elegant.
0:16:14|0:16:19|The wind blew past her cigarette-holding fingertips, brushed through her hair, and the photographer saw her trance.
0:16:19|0:16:25|[Jennifer] stood with one hand crossed over her chest, the other hand holding a cigarette, leaning against the glass partition outside the mall.
0:16:25|0:16:32|The photographer walked up to her, one meter away, with his hands in his pockets and a lollipop in his mouth.
0:16:37|0:16:41|Jennifer didn't respond, she just took out a cigarette from the cigarette case and handed it to him.
0:16:42|0:16:50|The photographer took the cigarette from his mouth, patted his pocket with his left hand, and then took the cigarette down helplessly, asking.
0:16:50|0:16:54|Jennifer blinked in silence and handed him the lighter.
0:16:54|0:17:2|The photographer raised the hand holding the sugar to shield the lighter, pressing it several times before lighting the cigarette. He carefully examined the lighter before returning it.
0:17:4|0:17:13|[Jennifer] took the lighter, kept her original posture looking at the street view, the photographer exhaled a puff of smoke, put the lollipop back in her mouth, and couldn't help but speak.
0:17:15|0:17:15|[Jennifer] smiled faintly without saying a word.
0:17:17|0:17:19|[Jennifer] finally turned to look at him, scanning him up and down, and asked non-stop.
0:17:37|0:17:49|When the photographer left, [Jennifer] was already eating the same lollipop, and the two bid farewell easily.
0:17:49|0:17:53|Photographer [Da Miao] still chewing on a lollipop.
0:18:29|0:18:41|[Jennifer] and [Zhuo Xiaolin] organized a drinking session together. [Jennifer] was getting tipsy and chatting animatedly, while [Zhuo Xiaolin] sitting across from her was just focused on watching her, occasionally squinting and laughing heartily.
0:18:41|0:18:48|[Zhuo Xiaolin]'s partner poured Erguotou for [Jennifer], who seemed to enjoy it, and quickly downed two or three glasses of liquor.
0:18:48|0:18:52|[Duoduo] watched as she finished her drink and then tilted her head back to down another cup of white wine.
0:18:52|0:18:58|In the early morning, sunlight filtered through the curtains and stood on the bed. [Jennifer] lay on her side, reaching out groggily to touch the silk sheets.
0:18:59|0:19:9|After a moment, [Zhuo Xiaolin] opened her eyes. She was still wearing the bright skirt from yesterday, barefoot on the illuminated wooden floor, walking to the window and pulling back the curtains.
0:19:48|0:19:53|Jennifer smiles and gestures to tear open the package seal.
0:19:53|0:19:57|She took out an ID card from the paper bag, memories of last night flooding into her mind.
0:20:14|0:20:22|[Jennifer] hurriedly slapped her ID card away, [Zhuo Xiaolin] took the opportunity to get close to her lips, memories abruptly stopped, [Jennifer] picked up her phone.
0:20:30|0:20:35|[Jennifer] paced back and forth in front of the French windows, a smile playing on her lips and in her eyes.
0:20:35|0:20:40|In the luxurious decorated Western restaurant, [Zhuo Xiaolin] squatted in front of the dining table, staring at the salad and asking.
0:22:7|0:22:12|After drinking, the two interlocked their fingers at the dining table and embraced each other, dancing slowly.
0:22:12|0:22:20|[Jennifer] placed her hand on [Zhuo Xiaolin]'s neck, bringing them closer together. [Zhuo Xiaolin] cupped [Jennifer]'s face and gently kissed her lips.
0:22:20|0:22:28|[Jennifer] hugged him tightly, seeming eager to encourage, tilting her head back to enjoy the gradually intensifying affection, the crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling becoming blurred.
0:22:29|0:22:32|Zhuo Xiaolin and Duoduo walked hand in hand to the night market on the street.
0:22:32|0:22:38|Jennifer picks up a piece of unfinished peanut cake at the small stall and stuffs it into her mouth.
0:22:38|0:22:51|The young shopkeeper greeted the regular customers and immediately ushered them to their seats.
0:22:51|0:22:55|[Zhuo Xiaolin] followed [Jennifer]'s gaze and saw an elderly couple sitting at a table, feeding each other.
0:22:59|0:23:3|In the bridal shop, [Duoduo] sits in front of the dressing table, smiling brightly.
0:23:3|0:23:8|She stood in front of her boyfriend in a wedding dress adorned with water diamonds, with [Young Shopkeeper] helping her hold the train.
0:23:9|0:23:13|[Duoduo] is held in the arms of her boyfriend, tilts her head back and gives him a sweet kiss.
0:23:13|0:23:18|Beside her, [Zhuo Xiaolin] watched her sister's mischievous antics and laughed heartily.
0:23:18|0:23:24|The [Young Shopkeeper] across the street had a completely different attitude, leaning against the mirror with his head down, unwilling to look at the two of them.
0:23:24|0:23:29|[Duoduo] covered her mouth and laughed unaffectedly, immersed in the happiness of her new marriage.
0:23:29|0:23:36|The young shopkeeper looked so happy and cheerful, brushing off the English from earlier.
0:23:36|0:23:38|The couple is interviewing for divorce at the marriage registration office.
0:23:47|0:23:53|The two of them smiled at each other and leaned in together to take wedding photos.
0:24:46|0:24:51|The groom impatiently handed the tray of wedding candies to [Duoduo] and walked away.
0:24:51|0:24:55|[Duoduo] looked at his retreating figure, puzzled.
0:24:55|0:25:1|The young shopkeeper was browsing Weibo on a tablet in front of the stall. When he looked up and saw Duoduo returning in a waiter's uniform, he immediately questioned him.
0:25:25|0:25:40|[Duoduo] silently put away the candy, [Young Shopkeeper] turned to look at him, sensing something was wrong. He walked over to his side, bent down carefully to observe his expression, then put on a harmless smile.
0:25:53|0:25:55|Duoduo's lips curled into a smile.
0:26:23|0:26:29|[Young Shopkeeper] snatched a bag of candies from [Duoduo] and tore open the packaging with his mouth.
0:26:29|0:26:33|He stuffed the candy into his mouth, making a satisfied humming sound as he chewed.
0:26:33|0:26:38|The young shopkeeper leaned on the table, looking at Duoduo.
0:26:38|0:26:42|[Duoduo] lowered his head and chuckled.
0:26:42|0:26:47|Zhuo Xiaolin and Duoduo are eating skewers at a roadside stall.
0:26:47|0:26:48|[Young Shopkeeper] gazed at [Duoduo] across the room.
0:26:56|0:26:59|The young shopkeeper sat up straight and said.
0:27:30|0:27:36|Zhuo Xiaolin and Duoduo walked side by side on the night market street.
0:28:14|0:28:20|The young shopkeeper caught Duoduo's wrist as he caught up.
0:28:20|0:28:23|[Duoduo] shook off his hand and crossed his arms, looking at him.
0:28:36|0:28:39|[Duoduo] bit her lip and stood slantingly without saying a word.
0:28:45|0:28:48|[Young Shopkeeper] waved his hand.
0:29:13|0:29:18|[Duoduo] pointed at the nose of the Young Shopkeeper, but the anger dissipated.
0:29:18|0:29:21|A slap landed squarely on [Young Shopkeeper]'s face.
0:29:21|0:29:25|[Duoduo] looked at the palm of her hand and then turned her head to see Li Gongnan.
0:29:25|0:29:30|He watched the two of them as if watching a play, a sly smile playing at the corner of his mouth.
0:31:10|0:31:20|In the room, [Duoduo] sits in front of the dressing table, spraying perfume. He carefully rubs the fragrance on his wrist behind his ear, then smooths his hair and leans closer to the mirror, revealing a charming smile.
0:31:20|0:31:29|Meanwhile, [Young Shopkeeper] sat in a dimly lit bar, taking a few big gulps from a bottle of beer, then slowly shaking his head with a lowered gaze.
0:31:35|0:31:39|The bar was empty, with only [Young Shopkeeper] and rustic wooden tables and chairs left.
0:31:39|0:31:59|In the bedroom of the bridal chamber, [Duoduo] with a smile on her face climbed onto the bed first, leaned close to [Zhuo Xiaolin]'s ear, only to find that he was already fast asleep.
0:31:59|0:32:3|[Duoduo] lingered around [the engineering student], but didn't get a response.
0:32:9|0:32:16|[Duoduo] took a deep breath and turned around, helplessly grabbing his hair a few times, looking at [Zhuo Xiaolin] with unwillingness.
0:32:16|0:32:25|The sleeping [Engineering Student] lay on his side with his back to [Duoduo], completely still.
0:32:25|0:32:34|[Duoduo] pushed him away disdainfully, pulled the blanket over more than half of it, lay down for a few seconds, and then pushed [the Engineering Student] hard, expressing her disapproval.
0:32:43|0:32:46|The moon hung high in the sky, and the neon lights reflected dazzling light.
0:32:46|0:32:51|[Jennifer] woke up from a nightmare, tears streaming down the corners of her eyes.
0:32:51|0:32:57|She set up a tent in the middle of the living room, sitting inside holding a doll and chatting away.
0:33:9|0:33:13|[Jennifer] cuddles the doll, but her thoughts drift to a boy.
0:33:13|0:33:19|In the studio, [Zhuo Xiaolin] is eating a lollipop.
0:33:19|0:33:23|[Zhuo Xiaolin] picked up her phone, opened WeChat, and looked at the screen, raising her eyebrows.
0:33:33|0:33:34|Shortly after, a message was received immediately.
0:33:40|0:33:43|Junmo still had a look on his face as if he was about to cry.
0:33:43|0:33:47|[Zhuo Xiaolin] thought for a moment and scooped the lollipop in his mouth between his front teeth.
0:33:47|0:33:53|He packed two portions of braised noodles and placed them on the dining table, then turned around to fetch two plates from the kitchen.
0:33:53|0:34:0|[Jennifer] sat at the table, watching him intently.
0:34:0|0:34:4|[Zhuo Xiaolin] handed the chopsticks to [Jennifer], then sat down and helped her open the lid of the packaging box.
0:34:7|0:34:13|He just raised his chopsticks and then awkwardly said.
0:34:13|0:34:17|Jennifer smiled and picked up a wide noodle, feeding it into her mouth. Zhuo Xiaolin looked at her and asked.
0:34:26|0:34:30|[Zhuo Xiaolin] watched as [Jennifer] ate the noodles with great concentration, and soon found herself feeling hungry as well.
0:34:30|0:34:33|She ate noodles heartily, but couldn't hide the smile at the corner of her mouth.
0:34:33|0:34:40|In [Jennifer]'s small tent at home, a pair of dolls cuddled together under the light, warm and beautiful.
0:34:40|0:34:42|The next morning, [Zhuo Xiaolin] was busy in the kitchen.
0:34:44|0:34:54|The lilies by the window obscured her figure, [Jennifer] quietly approached [Zhuo Xiaolin], and embraced her waist from behind, closing her eyes gently against her back.
0:34:54|0:35:1|[Damao] put down the milk carton in his hand, grabbed [Jennifer]'s hand, and turned around, his deep eyes gazing into hers.
0:35:1|0:35:10|[Zhuo Xiaolin] pins [Jennifer] down on the bed, steadies her lips with his hand, deftly removes her T-shirt, and plants hot kisses on [Jennifer]'s neck.
0:35:26|0:35:35|[Jennifer] jumped into the pool, wearing a dress like a lily, and swam towards [Zhuo Xiaolin]. They romantically kissed underwater, in this moment, they only had each other.
0:35:39|0:35:45|In front of the ancient painted screen, Zhuo Xiaolin, with exquisite makeup, lightly waved a paper fan and sang softly.
0:35:45|0:35:54|A glamorous lady with jewels in the audience blows on the teacup in her hand, while [Jennifer] sits next to her on a stone-glued chair, attentively enjoying Kunqu opera.
0:35:54|0:36:2|The spacious hall was filled with nearly ten dining tables, but there were only two guests, [Jennifer] and her wife, sitting at the central VIP table, clearly having reserved the whole place.
0:36:5|0:36:13|Madam put down the tea in her hand and turned her gaze to [Jennifer]. [Jennifer] seemed to sense something and silently averted her eyes.
0:36:37|0:36:43|Jennifer stopped herself just as the words were about to come out of her mouth, and Zhuo Xiaolin's mother turned to look at her, trying to persuade her.
0:37:9|0:37:15|[Ma Dongmei] looked at [Jennifer] unmoved, leaning back on the chair and said leisurely.
0:37:36|0:37:43|[Jennifer] pursed her lips, quickly packed up her purse and coat, stood up, smiled politely, and then turned around to leave the teahouse with large strides.
0:37:45|0:37:52|In the night market, [Jennifer] sat alone at a roadside stall, steam rising from the bowl, enveloping her face.
0:37:52|0:37:58|Her sunglasses shielded the tears, but her heaving shoulders were filled with determination.
0:37:58|0:38:3|The bright moonlight illuminated the roof, with [Jennifer] wearing a knitted robe, sitting on the outdoor beam.
0:38:3|0:38:6|She swayed the red wine glass in her hand, tears streaming down uncontrollably.
0:38:22|0:38:40|She arrived at the small noodle stall she often visited, and Zhuo Xiaolin's eyes lit up with joy. She smiled, turned around immediately, and walked back home. On the dining table at home, there were scented candles burning, and Duoduo set out tall glass cups and braised noodles.
0:38:44|0:38:52|[Jennifer] opened the door and saw [Zhuo Xiaolin], she walked in quietly, stood at the entrance rubbing her hands nervously.
0:38:54|0:39:7|The flickering candlelight reflected on [Jennifer]'s face, showing her gentle and serene expression. She habitually tucked her long hair behind her ear and looked up at the [Zhuo Xiaolin] sitting at the table.
0:39:7|0:39:13|[Zhuo Xiaolin] placed a tall glass in front of her, then walked to the other side to pour red wine for her.
0:39:13|0:39:21|[Jennifer] lowered her head, a faint smile on her face, while [Zhuo Xiaolin] looked at her sincerely, tightly holding her hands.
0:39:21|0:39:25|Before long, [Zhuo Xiaolin] carried a large cake in from the door, followed by her studio partners.
0:39:26|0:39:34|The partners were blessed with flowers by everyone, and they embraced and kissed amidst the laughter of the crowd.
0:40:5|0:40:9|[Zhuo Xiaolin] and [Jennifer] cuddled together on the rooftop, with flickering candlelight beside them.
0:40:39|0:40:47|Tian impatiently sighed as he helped the goose, then decided to leave the recording studio and return to the living room, sitting on the sofa and sulking with his knees pressed together.
0:40:47|0:40:55|The slender agent followed along and, seeing his appearance, helplessly slowed down and sat beside him.
0:41:30|0:41:33|[Zhuo Xiaolin] looked silently at the agent.
0:41:33|0:41:37|He walked slowly back to the bedroom, and it seemed like Zhuo Xiaolin was lying on the bed reading a book.
0:41:37|0:41:45|[Kouzi] took a bite of the toast, flipping through the pages with one hand, while swinging her legs casually in the air.
0:41:45|0:41:50|He was looking at a picture book, mostly filled with live concert photos.
0:41:50|0:41:54|[Zhuo Xiaolin] pulled up the blanket with one foot and looked straight at the bed.
0:41:54|0:41:56|He sat on the edge of the bed, recalling the scene when he first met [Duoduo].
0:42:42|0:42:57|Tianye, who was eating in the store, looked at Zhuo Xiaolin with interest.
0:42:57|0:43:3|Linzi, sitting next to Tianye, also looked towards [Duoduo], listening attentively.
0:43:31|0:43:34|The young shopkeeper handed a pen to Zhuo Xiaolin.
0:43:34|0:43:38|Tianye placed the paper on the gift box of peanut cake and quickly wrote down a line of words.
0:43:38|0:43:45|Tianye stared intently at [Button].
0:43:45|0:43:50|He handed her the paper, and [Zhuo Xiaolin] hesitated for a moment before taking it.
0:43:50|0:43:54|[Young Shopkeeper] smiled and saw the guest off.
0:43:54|0:43:56|In the bar, Zhuo Xiaolin sings passionately.
0:44:28|0:44:43|That night, [Zhuo Xiaolin] and Tianye sat in a corner of the bar, talking to each other.
0:44:43|0:44:47|After finishing the song, as time passed, Tianye was interviewed by the media at home.
0:45:25|0:45:30|The female host handed the microphone to Tianye, but received a long silence in return.
0:45:30|0:45:37|On the other side, [Zhuo Xiaolin] was at home concentrating on typing, while [Duoduo] lay on the bed, legs crossed, looking at the tablet.
0:45:53|0:45:59|Kouzi looked at Tianye on the screen and started to have a headache again. He wearily supported his forehead and closed his eyes.
0:45:59|0:46:9|After a while, he sat by the fountain in the neighborhood humming a song.
0:46:9|0:46:13|Tianye parked the car in front of [Zhuo Xiaolin], who stood up and looked at him.
0:46:44|0:46:48|Tian gently caressed Duoduo's embroidered hair, holding it tightly on her shoulders.
0:46:48|0:46:51|On the dazzling and dreamy stage, [Zhuo Xiaolin] sang passionately.
0:47:5|0:47:7|Tianye walked onto the stage and called for the accompaniment to stop.
0:47:37|0:47:47|[Zhuo Xiaolin] came to the scene to watch the rehearsal of [Duoduo], she sat down alone, and Tian also sat down shortly after, leaving a seat between them. [Duoduo] was on stage with eyes closed, feeling the music.
0:47:48|0:47:53|[Zhuo Xiaolin] on the stage lowered her eyes and opened her mouth to speak to Tianye.
0:48:37|0:48:40|In the bedroom of the wedding case, [Duoduo] helps [the Engineer] with the laundry.
0:48:59|0:49:3|[Zhuo Xiaolin] sat on the edge of the bed, leaning back, and said discontentedly.
0:49:17|0:49:23|[Duoduo] threw the clothes to [the Engineer], lay on the bed angrily, lifted her foot and pressed the clothes under her legs.
0:49:23|0:49:31|[The Engineer] impatiently took off his own clothes, [Duoduo] turned around, glared at him hatefully, and suddenly sat up on the bed.
0:49:57|0:50:3|[Duoduo] threw the clothes on [the Engineer] this time, and watched as he sat down and kicked it away.
0:50:31|0:50:35|Li Gongnan held [Duoduo]'s ankle, with no hint of tenderness in his eyes.
0:50:35|0:50:40|[Duoduo] stubbornly stared at him, but he turned his head away and remained silent.
0:51:7|0:51:13|[Duoduo] looked at the customer with red eyes, she pursed her lips and directly took out the business license and walked up to the customer.
0:51:59|0:52:8|The female customer took the pastries and left, leaving [Duoduo] fuming. She knocked over the paper cover on the stall, and [Young Shopkeeper] wanted to advise her but hesitated.
0:52:12|0:52:26|[Duoduo] turned around, leaning against the stall, while the onlookers continued to watch the exhibition with undiminished interest. [Young Shopkeeper] sighed and shouted to disperse the crowd.
0:52:26|0:52:33|The onlooker stood still and smoked indifferently, seeing no action here, he leisurely walked away.
0:52:33|0:52:37|[Duoduo] lowered her head with her arms crossed, then suddenly frowned and burst into tears without any apparent reason.
0:52:38|0:52:42|The bright red headband she had tied on her hairline stood out even more.
0:52:42|0:52:50|[Duoduo] has always been called "Peanut Butter Beauty" by the small vendors. When she sets up her stall, she naturally dresses up like this.
0:52:50|0:53:2|[Duoduo] shrugged her shoulders, crying heavily and gasping for breath. She hugged herself in a helpless manner, rubbing her shoulders back and forth like a young girl.
0:53:2|0:53:8|The young shopkeeper walked up to her, raised his hand in the air for a moment, then gently comforted [Duoduo] by placing his hand on her shoulder.
0:53:10|0:53:15|[Duoduo] turned his head to look elsewhere, but couldn't suppress the sadness, burying his head in his arms and sobbing.
0:53:15|0:53:20|The young shopkeeper put down what he was holding and silently stood by his side.
0:53:20|0:53:25|Halfway through, [Duoduo] looked up, and seeing that he was feeling better, [Young Shopkeeper] leaned against him shoulder to shoulder.
0:53:25|0:53:30|[Duoduo] blinked hard, holding back the tears, gradually calming down.
0:53:35|0:53:38|[Young Shopkeeper] quietly watched [Duoduo], who furrowed her brows.
0:53:41|0:53:44|[Duoduo] lowered her head, once again concealing the welling tears.
0:53:44|0:53:47|Young Shopkeeper also had tears in his eyes as he turned away.
0:54:9|0:54:20|The young shopkeeper glanced at him, lowered his eyes, and remained silent.
0:54:20|0:54:23|[Duoduo] rubbed his nose and then covered his mouth.
0:54:23|0:54:26|Young Shopkeeper tilted his head to one side and let out a soft sigh.
0:54:26|0:54:33|The crowd behind was bustling, and [Duoduo] looked at him choked up.
0:54:33|0:54:35|He supported his face, his brows furrowed tightly.
0:54:54|0:55:5|The young shopkeeper turned around, stroked Duoduo's head, and then comforted her by patting her shoulder.
0:55:5|0:55:7|Duoduo's fingers pointed accurately at her chin.
0:55:9|0:55:13|Her mouth was twisted in a half-crying, half-smiling expression, her hand trembling as it touched her neck.
0:55:13|0:55:31|Finally, she couldn't help but lean on the arm of the Young Shopkeeper and burst into tears.
0:55:31|0:55:34|Young Shopkeeper wrapped his arms around her, looking expressionless.
0:55:34|0:55:36|[Jennifer] took [Duoduo] and her friend Lucy out for dinner.
0:56:58|0:57:0|You have walked through so many cities.
0:57:21|0:57:26|[Jennifer] lights a cigarette in front of the mirror in the bathroom.
0:57:50|0:58:2|[Zhanjie] held a cigarette, looking at her admirers, she lowered her head and chuckled softly.
0:58:2|0:58:9|[Zhan Jie] held her arm with one hand, cigarette pinched between her fingers. She took a shallow drag, letting the smoke linger in her lungs before exhaling slowly.
0:58:10|0:58:17|Jennifer's bedroom is filled with French romance, Zhuo Xiaolin wears an eye mask and sleeps soundly on the ornate bed.
0:58:17|0:58:27|[Jennifer] took off her coat and climbed onto the bed, getting close to [Zhuo Xiaolin]. She lowered her head and kissed the back of her hand, then kissed her arm as she moved up.
0:58:27|0:58:32|Da Miao rubbed his hand on his stomach back and forth, but there was no movement.
0:58:32|0:58:38|Jennifer's hands were propped up next to Zhuo Xiaolin, kissing her young boyfriend's chest and face one after another.
0:58:49|0:59:0|[Jennifer] failed to get a kiss, then suddenly got off the bed and opened the curtains.
0:59:47|0:59:51|[Zhuo Xiaolin] woke up with an upgraded bad mood turning into anger, and she got out of bed, speaking without filter.
1:0:2|1:0:10|[Zhuo Xiaolin] let out a sigh, walked to the window with his upper body bare, and opened a gap in the curtain, breathing in the air outside with great effort.
1:0:10|1:0:13|[Jennifer] shed tears as she watched her leave.
1:0:13|1:0:22|[Zhuo Xiaolin] returned to her photography studio, threw her coat on the table, and sat angrily in the chair.
1:0:22|1:0:25|She turned on the desk lamp, but her emotions did not calm down.
1:0:30|1:0:35|[Jennifer] is lying on the bed, covering her eyes and crying.
1:0:35|1:0:38|She wiped away the tears from the corner of her eye with the back of her hand.
1:0:38|1:0:46|[Duoduo] sat in the studio for a long time, took out her phone to contact [Jennifer], but her finger hovered over the screen without pressing it.
1:0:46|1:0:51|She stared at her phone, tightly pursed her lips, and after some hesitation, she finally put down the phone.
1:0:51|1:0:56|She looked out the window, tiredly supporting her forehead and closing her eyes in contemplation.
1:1:10|1:1:14|In the Cha Guan Li, [Ma Dongmei] placed an exquisite gift box on the table.
1:1:14|1:1:20|She saw Zhuo Xiaolin staring at her phone, so she picked up the teacup and persuaded her.
1:2:5|1:2:16|[Zhuo Xiaolin] looked at her mother's worried expression, reached out and touched her face, comforting her.
1:2:22|1:2:27|Watching [Duoduo] pick up the gift and leave, [Duoduo]'s mother also felt a little relieved.
1:2:27|1:2:37|[Jennifer] fell asleep in the tent in the living room, with her two dolls lying on either side of her. She held one of them tightly as she drifted off into dreamland.
1:2:37|1:2:45|In her dream, with disheveled hair and pale lips, she saw Zhuo Xiaolin and other female models hugging each other, while she herself hid aside and cried silently.
1:2:46|1:2:49|Jennifer wakes up from a dream, looks at the laptop, and lights a cigarette.
1:2:49|1:2:55|On the screen is a Weibo photo album of [Zhuo Xiaolin], with a girl hugging [Zhuo Xiaolin] from behind while he is working.
1:2:55|1:3:0|She frequently appears in photos of [Zhuo Xiaolin], [Jennifer] smokes and stares at these photos.
1:3:1|1:3:11|He seemed to enter the scene in the photo, watching Zhuo Xiaolin playing snooker with the girl in the billiard room, watching Zhuo Xiaolin closely guiding the girl's body, teaching her how to draw the cue.
1:3:11|1:3:21|Jennifer looked up at the birdcage hanging on the window, where two tiger-striped parrots were inside.
1:3:21|1:3:26|In the health club, the masseur gives Zhuo Xiaolin a back massage.
1:3:26|1:3:28|After the call was disconnected, [Zhuo Xiaolin] remembered again,
1:3:33|1:3:40|[Lucy] looked up at [Jennifer] who was soaking in the bathtub.
1:3:40|1:3:43|[Jennifer] leaned over the edge of the bathtub to answer the phone.
1:3:49|1:3:54|Next to the bathtub hangs a layer of gauze, faintly revealing [Jennifer]'s beautiful back.
1:4:1|1:4:10|[Jennifer] on the massage bed raised her head again, waving her hand to signal the massage room to leave.
1:4:10|1:4:29|[Lucy] wrapped in a towel, walked up to [Jennifer] and pulled out a few pieces of paper from a nearby box to wipe away her tears.
1:4:33|1:4:55|[Lucy] gently stroked [Jennifer]'s long hair, quietly listening to her cry.
1:5:54|1:5:59|Jennifer reached out and put her arm around Lucy's neck, leaning on her shoulder, unable to speak.
1:5:59|1:6:5|At night, by the fountain in the residential area, the street lamps were as bright as fire, and a nanny car slowly drove into the neighborhood.
1:6:5|1:6:18|[Zhuo Xiaolin], sitting by the fountain reading a book, noticed the light of the car headlights and turned to look.
1:6:18|1:6:23|The car came to a stop, [Zhuo Xiaolin] turned around, furrowed her brows and closed the book. She raised her hand to check the time on her watch.
1:6:26|1:6:40|[Kouzi] got off the passenger seat, [Da Miao] also walked up to [Kouzi] with a guitar in hand, sighed and said.
1:6:40|1:6:49|He shook his head and continued speaking.
1:6:49|1:6:53|[Kouzi] smiled happily, took the guitar and held it in her arms, then looked at it carefully and said.
1:7:18|1:7:31|[Kouzi] planted a kiss on [Da Miao]'s face, happily hugged the guitar and walked towards other residential buildings. This scene was clearly seen by [Zhuo Xiaolin] behind the fountain, who took a deep breath and tightly pursed her lips.
1:7:31|1:7:38|Upon arriving home, [Zhuo Xiaolin] sat on the sofa and looked through the receipts in [Duoduo]'s bag, while [Duoduo] came over to protect the bag.
1:7:52|1:7:55|[Zhuo Xiaolin] stared at [Duoduo] with a scrutinizing gaze.
1:8:17|1:8:27|[Kouzi] turned around in anger, ignoring him. After a while, [Kouzi] started to tidy up the clothes in the wardrobe, while [Zhuo Xiaolin] sat in front of the computer silently observing.
1:8:27|1:8:35|[Kouzi] threw the large suitcase from the wardrobe onto the bed, quickly stuffing all the clothes into it, with [Zhuo Xiaolin] not stopping her at all.
1:8:35|1:8:41|In the blink of an eye, [Duoduo] was sitting in the passenger seat next to Tianye, the wind blowing through his hair, his eyes looking lost and helpless.
1:8:43|1:8:50|In pouring rain, the night market was bustling as usual. [Zhuo Xiaolin] walked into the familiar snack stall with an umbrella.
1:8:50|1:8:54|She slowly closed the umbrella and sat down at an empty table.
1:8:54|1:9:2|She sat in front of a full house, with [Jennifer] and [Duoduo] sitting at the table in front of her.
1:9:2|1:9:9|[Zhuo Xiaolin] mischievously opens her mouth and asks [Jennifer] for a tangyuan to eat. [Jennifer] pretends to spit out the tangyuan from her mouth and teases her by biting it on the side of her mouth.
1:9:9|1:9:20|Unexpectedly, [Duoduo] took a bite of the tangyuan, smiling mischievously. [Zhuo Xiaolin] looked at this affectionate couple absentmindedly, feeling melancholic as she sat alone on the edge of the bed late at night.
1:9:20|1:9:32|[Zhuo Xiaolin] stood under the shower head in the bathroom, bathing without turning on the light. Her eyes were fixed on a spot on the wall, gradually focusing on a photo of [Duoduo] looking back with a wooden expression, smiling brightly.
1:9:32|1:9:41|Beside the peanut paste stall, [Duoduo] yawned lightly while checking the inventory, unaware of the [Engineering Student] behind him pulling a suitcase.
1:9:41|1:9:49|[The Engineer] had lost his usual vigor on his face, wearing only a loose long-sleeved T-shirt. He looked lost as he watched the back of [Duoduo].
1:9:50|1:9:55|[Duoduo] noticed his gaze, turned to look, and the two of them looked at each other in silence.
1:9:55|1:10:7|In the end, the two sat at a nearby noodle stall, with [Li Gongnan] bowing his head and devouring a bowl of noodles, while [Duoduo] sat with arms crossed, coldly watching him, the chopsticks in front of her unmoved.
1:10:7|1:10:13|In the bedroom of the bridal chamber, [Duoduo] sits in front of the dressing table, caressing the embossed gold characters on the marriage certificate.
1:10:13|1:10:20|[Li Gongnan] sat on the edge of the bed, wearily closed his eyes, shook his head with two fingers, looked up at the sky and sighed.
1:10:20|1:10:30|The room was eerily quiet, [Duoduo] stared at the marriage certificate in her hand, then suddenly picked up the lighter next to her and pressed the ignition button repeatedly.
1:10:30|1:10:32|[Li Gongnan] put on his glasses and looked at [Duoduo].
1:10:49|1:10:55|On the dressing table, there is a photo of the two embracing closely. [Duoduo] presses the lighter to ignite a corner of the marriage certificate.
1:10:57|1:11:5|In the flickering flames, [Duoduo] calmly throws the marriage certificate on the table, his eyes empty.
1:11:5|1:11:10|The [Engineering Student] behind him looked at the flames through the mirror, with no change in expression.
1:11:10|1:11:16|In the airport lobby, a panicked young man rushes in. This person is none other than [Zhuo Xiaolin] who has just arrived.
1:11:16|1:11:24|He looked around at the entrance, checked the flight schedule on the electronic screen, and then hurriedly went to the direct hit counter to make a phone call.
1:11:25|1:11:29|She kept talking on the phone, but received no response.
1:11:29|1:11:36|She hung up the phone and looked around, standing in place crying loudly like a lost child.
1:11:36|1:11:43|[Damao] walked aimlessly to the familiar night market, then arrived at Jennifer's house, sitting on the second floor by the iron railing, looking down.
1:11:49|1:11:56|This angle provides a perfect view of the translucent tent in the living room, as if Jennifer is still sound asleep inside.
1:11:56|1:12:1|[Zhuo Xiaolin] lay in the tent, holding a cloth doll embroidered with the lover's breath on it.
1:12:1|1:12:11|The next morning, [Zhuo Xiaolin] sat on the roof with a birdcage. One parrot in the cage was quietly perched on the crossbar, while the other was flapping its wings between the bars, trying to fly out.
1:12:12|1:12:22|He opened the cage door, slowly reached in, grabbed the cheerful parrot, brought it close to his eyes, then released it by letting go.
1:12:22|1:12:27|He then caught another one, blew on it and examined it carefully for a while, before tossing it into the air with a sense of relief.
1:12:27|1:12:27|Tianye is standing on the stage at the concert.
1:12:45|1:12:52|Tianye turned to look at the side of the stage, where Duoduo and Young Shopkeeper were sitting side by side in the audience, waving glow sticks frantically.
1:12:52|1:12:57|[Duoduo] wearing a sleeveless lace dress, walked up to the stage and embraced Tianye with a smile.
1:13:38|1:13:46|Duoduo, with tears in her eyes, looked at Zhuo Xiaolin with relief, while Zhuo Xiaolin gazed at the audience below the stage.
1:13:57|1:14:1|[Duoduo] smiled gently and nodded silently.
1:14:20|1:14:27|[Zhuo Xiaolin] had tears in her eyes, and [Duoduo] looked at her, nodding confidently and giving her a thumbs up.
1:14:38|1:14:42|Duoduo covered her face in the audience, almost unable to control the surging tears.
1:14:42|1:14:48|Soon, he smiled and, grabbing the [Young Shopkeeper] next to him, waved glow sticks for [Duoduo].
1:14:48|1:14:51|[Kouzi] picked up the microphone again.
1:15:2|1:15:7|The Young Shopkeeper cheered loudly for Zhuo Xiaolin, and the audience around also applauded and cheered along.
1:15:11|1:15:18|Kuzi looked down at the audience with a sorrowful expression, the accompaniment playing as he closed his eyes and held back his tears.
1:15:18|1:15:30|He lightly tapped his forehead with his fingers, held the microphone in his hand, and looked at the night sky. The dazzling stage lights shone on him, sparkling like stars.
1:17:9|1:17:13|Images of countless moments with Zhuo Xiaolin flashed through Button's mind.
1:17:13|1:17:18|She turned around on the stage and discreetly wiped away the tears on her cheeks.
1:17:18|1:17:21|She had just clenched her fist, and another tear slipped from the corner of her eye.
1:17:21|1:17:27|At this moment, [Zhuo Xiaolin] had no idea that the person she missed had stepped onto the stage behind her.
1:17:27|1:17:33|When she composed herself and turned around to continue singing, she was surprised to see a familiar figure walking up beside her.
1:17:34|1:17:41|The man had broad shoulders, a tall figure, and was wearing a casual knitted jacket, but his eyes looking at her were particularly tender.
1:17:48|1:17:52|[Zhuo Xiaolin] walked onto the stage, tears in her eyes as she lovingly looked at [Duoduo].
1:17:52|1:17:58|[Kouzi] held the microphone, gazing at him, singing this love song, and walked towards him firmly step by step.
1:17:58|1:18:3|The spotlight shines on this reunited couple, Zhuo Xiaolin and Duoduo.
1:18:3|1:18:12|Suddenly, [Zhuo Xiaolin] tilted her head slightly upwards and fell unexpectedly on the stage.
1:18:12|1:18:16|[Zhuo Xiaolin] knelt beside [Duoduo] in a panic, holding his face and shouting loudly.
1:18:23|1:18:34|[Zhuo Xiaolin] and [Duoduo] got on the ambulance, the vehicle's tail lights fading into the distance. The concert venue was now empty, with only [Jennifer] left squatting in front of the large poster of her and [Duoduo].
1:18:34|1:18:37|She anxiously swayed her body, tilting her head back as if praying to [Button].
1:18:44|1:18:48|In the ambulance, [Zhuo Xiaolin] is in tears.
1:18:58|1:19:6|He looked at [Duoduo] and shook his head in regret.
1:19:6|1:19:17|In front of him, [Button] lay on the stretcher, with his eyes tightly closed.
1:19:17|1:19:19|[Zhuo Xiaolin] buried her head in her hands and cried quietly.
1:19:24|1:19:29|She cried until her ears were congested, using the back of her hand to constantly wipe away the tears that fell.
1:19:29|1:19:35|[Zhuo Xiaolin]'s hand suddenly lifted up and touched her hair, helping her smooth it down one by one.
1:19:35|1:19:40|[Zhuo Xiaolin] slowly lifted her head and gently held the hand as if waking from a dream.
1:19:40|1:19:44|She met the gaze of [Zhuo Xiaolin], and the two remained silent, yet all misunderstandings were dispelled.
1:19:45|1:19:56|The screen fades to black, and a year later, the night market in the ancient city is brightly lit, with various food stalls lining the streets as far as the eye can see. The streets are bustling with a crowd of people, creating a lively atmosphere.
1:19:56|1:20:11|One of the customers in this store is particularly crowded. The ancient-style flag reads "Da Song Peanut Cake, Kaifeng Special Product, Handmade". [Young Shopkeeper] swings a wooden hammer to make cakes with his bare upper body, while [Duoduo] carves melon seeds on the side. The two of them loudly call out to sell their goods.
1:20:20|1:20:25|Nian Tanxiang, [Zhuo Xiaolin] is typing on the desk pad, while [Duoduo] walks in with a thoughtful expression.
1:20:51|1:20:59|Tianye's smile is frozen in the frame, [Da Miao] arrives in the open countryside, using the camera to record every scene he observes.
1:20:59|1:21:7|He used his camera to capture the beautiful scenery along the way, visited the elderly left behind, and took the only photo of the elderly couple in the village.
1:21:7|1:21:17|He walked through the narrow ancient stone steps in the countryside, strolled along the field path lined with lush wild grass on both sides, stood on a small hill to take pictures of the distant scenery, and stretched his arms to bask in the sunlight.
1:21:18|1:21:27|[Jennifer] came to the rural primary school, distributing white paper to the children, teaching them to draw and write, and using a camera to record their learning achievements.
1:21:27|1:21:41|Jennifer sat at the airport, watching the video sent by Zhuo Xiaolin on her laptop.
1:21:48|1:21:54|Jennifer, with a fresh ponytail different from her usual style, watches the video with sharp eyes.
