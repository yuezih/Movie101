0:0:22|0:0:25|Night falls, and the entire town seems to fall into a deep sleep.
0:0:25|0:0:28|Looking around, only the houses in the center of the town were still lit up.
0:0:29|0:0:44|On the signboard on the roof it reads "Heaven on Earth", on the terrace the singer is showing graceful dance moves, at the entrance, [Old K] is escorting a man to see off the guests.
0:1:9|0:1:13|The fat man is sitting outside, gossiping with a group of dusty women.
0:1:13|0:1:18|A young man with a backpack, dressed in peasant clothing, walks by.
0:1:18|0:1:25|A young man arrived at a snack street, where he looked at Wang Damao making pancakes, Hong Tao selling lotus seeds, and other small vendors, feeling nervous.
0:1:25|0:1:28|At this moment, a loud shout from behind made him turn around to look.
0:1:30|0:1:35|A figure in night clothes leaped down from the second floor of the Heaven on Earth.
0:1:35|0:1:42|After somersaulting in the air for a few rounds, he landed on the roof behind Xiao Shangfan, and then smoothly rolled to the ground.
0:1:42|0:1:48|He then sat down several clear sky sails on the flat ground and hid behind the coffin lying on the ground.
0:1:48|0:1:54|As soon as he turned around, he was shot in the forehead with a gun and fell to the ground.
0:2:20|0:2:26|Welcome, the soldiers raised their guns and fired, writing a word on the coffin just now - death.
0:2:26|0:2:41|The scene zooms in on the words on the coffin, officially starting the movie. It tells the story of the early Republic of China, in the city of [Hong Tao] where people from all walks of life gather. Listen carefully, being able to work in Lord Wang's factory is a result of your ancestors' virtues, it's a great blessing.
0:3:21|0:3:34|As soon as he finished speaking, the door behind him opened, and a woman in a tight cheongsam with a high slit walked out, holding an oil-paper umbrella. Following her was a short and wealthy man.
0:3:34|0:3:40|The crooked-mouthed man who was just boasting quickly slapped himself in the face and hastily changed his tune,
0:3:45|0:3:48|Wang Damao quickly helped Hong Tao stand aside, unable to finish speaking.
0:3:48|0:4:5|The lady held an oiled paper umbrella for the master as she walked slowly towards the courtyard. The master sat expressionless on the boss chair in the center of the courtyard, while the lady disdainfully looked at the first interviewee, then rolled her eyes sharply before walking up to the second interviewee.
0:4:5|0:4:9|Approaching the third candidate with a look of disdain, holding his nose.
0:4:10|0:4:14|With a contemptuous glance, Wang Damao arrived in front of the fourth interviewee.
0:4:14|0:4:20|He looked up and down at the young man in front of him, who also gazed back at him with a determined look.
0:4:20|0:4:23|After two sentences, [Wang Damao] slowly spoke.
0:4:26|0:4:30|After speaking, she turned and walked towards [Old K] with a swaying posture.
0:4:30|0:4:34|Standing still, [Old K] spoke as if sitting in the boss's chair.
0:4:36|0:4:43|Old K, after listening to what his wife said, expressionless, slowly took out an old deck of playing cards from his sleeve.
0:4:43|0:4:54|Wang Damao watched the young man who came for the interview, then took out a deck of cards, using the small table in front of him as a pivot point, skillfully shuffling the cards and switching between different shuffling techniques.
0:4:54|0:5:2|Finally, after shuffling the cards in hand, [Old K] slowly raised the [Hong Tao] A, facing the interviewees in front of him, and then spoke.
0:5:4|0:5:19|After speaking, he scattered the playing cards into the air, and for a moment, the sky was filled with scattered playing cards. The crooked-mouthed man looked foolishly at the falling cards, while [Old K] closed his eyes and enjoyed it all. The interviewees stood dumbfounded in their original spots.
0:5:20|0:5:34|One of the interviewees looked firmly at a "Fang Pian" in front of him, as if he had a plan in mind. Mrs. Liu looked solemnly at the scattered replica cards, unaware that one card had already fallen on her chest.
0:5:34|0:5:41|With everyone's gaze, [Mrs. Liu] also realized something was wrong, and she looked towards her chest. The interviewees, seeing this, all crazily reached out towards her.
0:5:41|0:5:48|[Mrs. Liu] looked at the approaching group of people in horror, and quickly stepped back, only to twist her foot and fall backwards.
0:5:48|0:6:2|The oil lamp in his hand was thrown into the air due to weightlessness. Just as his body was about to touch the ground, a pair of strong hands caught him. [Mrs. Liu] looked in horror at the ground so close by, then turned to look at the man who caught her.
0:6:2|0:6:12|The man is the fourth interviewee he just praised. The fourth interviewee used his mouth to pick up the card at Mrs. Liu's chest, which is the [Hong Tao] A that can be left behind.
0:6:12|0:6:16|Old K suddenly opened his eyes as if sensing something.
0:6:23|0:6:26|[Old K] led [Shun Zi] to a courtyard.
0:6:27|0:6:29|He then spoke to the person guarding the house.
0:6:49|0:6:54|But then he thought of something and turned to give instructions.
0:6:54|0:7:7|After Old K left, Shun Zi quietly opened the door of Er Taimei's room. Once inside, he carefully turned around and closed the door. To his surprise, as he turned his head, a pair of scissors was placed against his neck. He opened his mouth in shock and said.
0:7:7|0:7:15|Hearing the voice, Er Second Madam looked at [Shun Zi] in front of her and couldn't help but shed tears.
0:7:15|0:7:21|The two of them were overjoyed and wept, embracing each other, as Mrs. Er said.
0:7:21|0:7:25|After a brief hug, [Shun Zi] stepped back from Er Tai Tai and asked.
0:7:30|0:7:37|[Chun Tian] choked up when talking about his father, and his once bright and lively eyes became dull and lifeless.
0:7:37|0:7:56|On the day of the incident, [Chun Tian]'s father sat in the audience, playing the pipa with his eyes closed, while [Chun Tian], dressed in elegant dance attire, danced at the intersection of the stairs. His jade-like hands gracefully moved, his watery eyes deep and serene. Just as he was immersed in it, the sound of the pipa suddenly stopped, and he looked up.
0:8:15|0:8:18|He sat in the chair, reaching out his hand to touch [Chun Tian] who was still kneeling on the ground.
0:8:18|0:8:25|Father passed away in the end, [Chun Tian] knelt in front of the grave. At this moment, Lord Cat and his men walked up and spoke.
0:8:41|0:8:45|After listening to everything Chun Tian had told, Shun Ze calmly asked.
0:8:56|0:8:59|[Shun Zi] placed both hands on [Chun Tian]'s shoulders, comforting him.
0:9:4|0:9:7|He embraced [Chun Tian] and calmly considered his countermeasures.
0:9:8|0:9:10|On the other side, [Wang Damao] exclaimed in surprise.
0:9:27|0:9:32|Upon hearing this, [Hong Tao] exclaimed in disbelief.
0:9:32|0:9:43|After expressing her emotions, [Hong Tao] stood up and walked towards the door. [Wang Damao] quickly followed suit, shouting after her as he walked.
0:9:43|0:9:49|Looking at the back of [Chun Tian], [Wang Damao] said.
0:9:55|0:9:57|[Shun Zi] hurriedly grabbed [Wang Damao] and said.
0:10:7|0:10:11|[Shun Zi] spoke with [Wang Damao] leading the way, and then said.
0:10:18|0:10:20|[Wang Damao] looked at [Shun Zi] in surprise.
0:10:21|0:10:23|He then said thoughtfully.
0:10:24|0:10:33|On the other side, [Hong Tao] is in the room wearing a gorgeous cheongsam, holding a glass of red wine, and with a mysterious look, she asks, "What do you think?"
0:10:43|0:10:45|The man with a crooked mouth, bare-chested, smiled and answered.
0:10:54|0:10:56|The crooked-mouthed man said lewdly.
0:11:0|0:11:6|After speaking, he winked at [Wang Damao], and this little flirt came over.
0:11:11|0:11:17|[Wang Damao] said fiercely, while the crooked-mouthed man walked up behind her and placed a hand on her shoulder to comfort her.
0:11:22|0:11:27|Upon hearing this, [Wang Damao]'s expression softened and he smiled at the crooked-mouthed man.
0:11:32|0:11:39|Speak up, [Wang Damao] turned around and leaned lightly on the table, while the crooked-mouthed man hurriedly approached to show his loyalty.
0:11:39|0:11:47|[Wang Damao] pushed the crooked-mouthed man away with his hand, then lifted his foot against the crooked-mouthed man's chest.
0:11:47|0:11:54|At that moment, the door of the room suddenly swung open, and [Old K] with a gloomy face walked in with his hands behind his back, asking.
0:11:55|0:11:58|At this moment, there was no sign of Wang Damao in the room.
0:12:4|0:12:18|[Hong Tao] finished speaking and turned to leave. [Wang Damao] immediately changed his expression, looking sorrowful as he got up from the table and left the room. The man with a crooked mouth then peeked out from under the table, looking terrified.
0:12:18|0:12:27|On the other side, [Shun Zi] entered the room where the common people rested with a bag on his back. He sat silently on a chair, looking at the rows of men sleeping on the kang.
0:12:27|0:12:32|Who knew, the [commoners] who had just been sleeping suddenly surrounded them out of the blue and asked.
0:12:36|0:12:43|Shun Zi turned around in fright, he quickly lit the oil lamp, but Old K earnestly advised him.
0:13:18|0:13:27|The next day, [Wang Damao] sat in the courtyard watching the [commoners] work, while [the man with a crooked mouth] held a watermelon and attentively spoke to [Hong Tao].
0:13:28|0:13:35|[Hong Tao] smiled slightly, shyly took the watermelon handed over by [Old K], and then impatiently handed the watermelon to [Wang Damao].
0:13:37|0:13:43|[Wang Damao] took the watermelon from [Hong Tao] and then handed it to [Chun Tian] standing next to him.
0:13:45|0:13:50|[Shun Zi] watched all this in the yard, and [Chun Tian] ended up with the watermelon, melting into the ground nearby.
0:13:53|0:13:58|Shun Zi, who was still pushing the millstone, saw Chun Tian's actions and then laughed foolishly at Chun Tian.
0:13:58|0:14:8|Who knew, Hong Tao blinked in surprise when she saw Shun Zi's smile, thinking she was flirting with her, and immediately shyly threw a flirtatious glance at her.
0:14:8|0:14:11|And [Shun Zi], upon seeing this, grimaced and started working.
0:14:18|0:14:30|He pretended his eyes were uncomfortable, leaning towards [Wang Damao]. As night fell, two night lights were hung at the gate of the Wang family courtyard, and the guards were all asleep on the ground. [Wang Damao] and [Hong Tao] were also fast asleep in the room.
0:14:30|0:14:38|In the mediocre room, the crooked man and a group of mediocre people have also entered dreamland, only [Shun Zi]'s bed is empty.
0:14:38|0:14:46|The night was deep, [Shun Zi] secretly took [Chun Tian], but unexpectedly, Mr. Cat suddenly sat up from the bed as if he had a premonition.
0:14:53|0:14:57|After speaking, Wang Damao lifted the blanket, got up, and walked out of the room.
0:14:57|0:15:3|[Shun Zi] and [Chun Tian] were running in the courtyard, about to step over the threshold, but suddenly stopped.
0:15:32|0:15:37|The two hurriedly passed by [Wang Damao] and quickly headed towards the door.
0:15:37|0:15:44|[Wang Damao] suddenly spoke out to stop the two, both of whom were stunned, then turned to look at him slowly, even calmly asking.
0:15:50|0:15:53|After Mr. Wang finished speaking, he walked towards the door on his own.
0:15:53|0:15:55|[Shun Zi] and [Chun Tian] are following behind him.
0:15:58|0:16:0|He slowly turned around to face the two of them.
0:16:0|0:16:4|In a moment of anxiety, [Shun Zi] gathered up the courage to ask.
0:16:26|0:16:27|The crooked-mouthed man stopped [Wang Damao].
0:16:30|0:16:34|[Wang Damao] looked down at his bandeau top.
0:16:35|0:16:38|When they arrived at the grave, [Wang Damao] knelt down and wept bitterly.
0:16:49|0:16:53|The crying abruptly stopped, and [Wang Damao] turned to look at [Wang Damao] and the crooked-mouthed man.
0:17:13|0:17:15|Looked at [Shun Zi] and [Chun Tian] again.
0:17:18|0:17:23|[Chun Tian] only moves to another place.
0:17:23|0:17:28|The old master Wang Damao, who wanted to make a statement, couldn't help but ask.
0:17:28|0:17:45|At dawn, everyone returned to the mansion. [Shun Zi] was grinding on the millstone in the courtyard, sweating profusely. [Wang Damao] walked over with a wooden bucket, his eyes fixed on [Shun Zi]. After a while, [Wang Damao] slyly hummed, causing [Shun Zi] to stop his work and bow to him.
0:18:6|0:18:14|[Shun Zi] lowered her head and dared not look at him, while [Wang Damao] blushed and turned to walk towards the bathhouse.
0:18:16|0:18:24|After speaking, she swayed into the bathhouse, and [Shun Zi] finally looked up with a gloomy expression, then left the courtyard.
0:18:24|0:18:31|In the bathhouse, [Wang Damao] sits in a wooden tub, pouting, arching her back, lifting her leg to the edge of the tub, and crudely scrubbing her feet.
0:18:31|0:18:39|Just as she was washing vigorously, the door slowly opened. [Wang Damao], with her back to the door, stopped her hands, twisted her body slightly, and shyly said.
0:18:52|0:19:0|Thinking it was [Shun Zi] who came, but turned around to find two useless people from home, which made [Mrs. Wang] so angry that she threw a towel at them.
0:19:0|0:19:6|Wang Damao put on his clothes and walked into Chun Tian's room with an air of superiority, ignoring even Shun Zi's greeting.
0:19:6|0:19:13|She walked into the room with sharp eyes, seeing [Wang Damao] sitting next to [Chun Tian], as [Mrs. Wang] swayed gracefully and spoke.
0:19:47|0:19:52|Night falls, Wang Damao lies on a large dining table wearing only a pair of oversized underpants.
0:19:52|0:19:58|His right leg bent, left leg crossed over it, one foot raised high, as if waiting for someone to arrive.
0:19:58|0:20:15|In the courtyard, [Shun Zi] sneaked up to the wall, cautiously looking around before quickly walking to a room door. He stopped in front of it, knocked on the door, and it opened to reveal [Chun Tian]. The two cautiously walked towards the main gate.
0:20:16|0:20:27|Who knew that [Wang Damao] also walked out from the door at this time, she leisurely waved the fan, but saw [Shun Zi] and [Chun Tian] trying to escape, and quickly went forward to stop the two.
0:20:27|0:20:31|Shun Zi and Chun Tian stood still, only to hear Mrs. Wang say again.
0:20:47|0:20:50|The two turned to go to the kitchen, but heard [Wang Damao] shout again.
0:20:53|0:20:57|[Wang Damao] pushed open the kitchen door, with [Shun Zi] and [Chun Tian] following closely behind.
0:20:57|0:21:1|Three of them stood still in shock when they saw the scene inside the house.
0:21:1|0:21:6|[Fang Pian] the butler stood up immediately upon seeing the arrival, sitting cross-legged with arms raised up.
0:21:6|0:21:8|Shun Zi looked at him like this and asked.
0:21:14|0:21:24|[Wang Damao] looked around with a helpless expression on his face as he walked towards the dining table.
0:21:24|0:21:29|[Chun Tian] followed closely behind, while the butler [Fang Pian] leered at the two with a sleazy look on his face.
0:21:29|0:21:34|Later, the two sat down at the dining table, with [Shun Zi] standing on the side.
0:21:34|0:21:37|[Wang Damao] awkwardly asked,
0:21:37|0:21:41|Fang Pian, the butler, said hesitantly.
0:21:59|0:22:4|Several people stood up to leave, but unexpectedly, [Wang Damao] walked into the room and looked at them, saying.
0:22:26|0:22:33|Mrs. Wang finished speaking and walked out of the room, followed closely by [Chun Tian]. After Shun Zi finished speaking, he also left the room.
0:22:33|0:22:38|At this moment, the only one left in the room was the butler [Fang Pian], sitting at the dining table in his underwear.
0:22:49|0:22:52|[Fang Pian] the butler confronts [Shun Zi] at the table.
0:23:20|0:23:28|He pulled out the knife stuck in the table, glared fiercely at the person opposite him, and pushed the knife out.
0:23:45|0:23:49|The housekeeper snorted coldly, then stood up from his seat and walked over to [Shun Zi].
0:23:49|0:23:55|Next, he picked up a piece of paper from the table and casually grabbed a brush, writing the words "kill" on the paper.
0:23:55|0:23:59|He looked up at [Shun Zi] and handed him the pen in his hand.
0:23:59|0:24:3|Shun Zi borrowed a brush and immediately wrote the characters for Wang Damao on the paper.
0:24:3|0:24:8|The two looked at each other, and at that moment, the door was opened by someone.
0:24:13|0:24:22|The newcomer is the protagonist on paper, [Shun Zi] and [Housekeeper Fang] quickly turned around to tear back what they had just written, only to be stopped by [Wang Damao].
0:24:22|0:24:29|[Wang Damao] sauntered up to the two of them, with [Fang Pian] and [Shun Zi] staring at him, their faces covered in sweat from nervousness.
0:24:29|0:24:34|Wang Damao looked at the two of them on guard, expressionlessly picked up the paper on the table and glanced at it.
0:24:35|0:24:39|Suddenly, he frowned and looked at [Fang Pian] and [Shun Zi].
0:24:59|0:25:16|[Wang Damao] smiled happily, nodded at [Fang Pian], and quickly left the room with permission from [Fang Pian]. He closed the door, leaned against the wall, and limped out of the courtyard.
0:25:39|0:25:45|[Wang Damao] crumpled the paper he had just written on and threw it aside, then took out a new piece of paper and a pen.
0:25:45|0:25:54|Just as he was about to pick up the pen to write, he suddenly paused, then turned his head and asked [Shun Zi] beside him.
0:25:54|0:26:2|[Shun Zi] took the pen from [Wang Damao] and wrote on the paper as requested. After finishing, [Shun Zi] handed the pen back to [Wang Damao].
0:26:14|0:26:21|As soon as the words fell, the door was opened, and [Wang Damao] walked in slowly from outside, looking at the two and asking.
0:26:24|0:26:27|[Shun Zi] turned to [Wang Damao] for help.
0:26:29|0:26:36|[Wang Damao] finished speaking, turned to look at [Shun Zi], gestured for him to deal with the contents on the paper, and then left the room.
0:26:36|0:26:45|Mrs. Wang watched as [Wang Damao] left, then she stared sharply at [Shun Zi], who tried to remain calm and stared back at her.
0:26:45|0:26:51|Mrs. Wang Damao walked up to [Shun Zi] and met his defiant gaze, causing him to lower his head in submission.
0:26:53|0:26:58|Shun Zi looked at Mrs. Wang with his eyes, but his hand secretly wanted to take the paper from the table.
0:26:58|0:27:4|Who knew he was stopped by Mrs. Wang, who took the paper from his hand and looked at it. It was written "I love Mrs. Wang" on it.
0:27:20|0:27:26|Mrs. Wang smiled and neatly folded the paper, then tucked it into her chest. [Shun Zi] explained with a smile.
0:27:36|0:27:46|Mrs. Wang Damao spun around with her body leaning back, while [Shun Zi] had one hand on her shoulder and the other around her waist, the two of them looking at each other with smiles, as beautiful as a painting, for a long time.
0:28:19|0:28:27|Mrs. Wang finished speaking, looking up at [Shun Zi] with a smile, and [Shun Zi] also looked at him with a mysterious smile on his face.
0:28:27|0:28:37|The turntable on the table played melodious music, and a pair of hands opened the drawer in front of the table. The person inside took out the arsenic from the drawer, and then closed the drawer.
0:29:0|0:29:10|[Shun Zi] took the noodles, knocked on the door of [Wang Damao]'s room, walked to the desk with the noodles in his hands, then bent down and placed the noodles steadily on [Wang Damao]'s desk.
0:29:10|0:29:12|He slightly raised his body and said.
0:29:15|0:29:18|[Wang Damao] stared at [Shun Zi] in silence, not saying a word.
0:29:28|0:29:41|[Shun Zi] carried the bowl of noodles laced with poison meant for [Wang Damao] into the room of the matriarch, placing it on the table inside. However, she almost blew her cover as soon as she opened her mouth.
0:29:43|0:29:45|Mrs. Wang Damao exclaimed in surprise.
0:29:45|0:29:48|Shun Zi hesitated for a moment, then quickly tried to make up for it.
0:29:48|0:30:6|Mrs. Wang immediately smiled when she heard this, she put down the comb in her hand, then opened the drawer under the dressing table and took out a small porcelain jar of poison. With a smile, she placed it next to her face, showing it to [Shun Zi]. She stood up, took the jar of poison and walked to the table.
0:30:14|0:30:17|At the dining table, [Wang Damao] sat in the main seat.
0:30:17|0:30:22|Sitting on both sides are Mrs. Wang and [Fang Pian], the steward, each with a bowl of noodles in front of them.
0:30:22|0:30:28|The three of them stared at the noodles in front of them in silence, while [Shun Zi] stood aside nonchalantly.
0:30:28|0:30:30|Three people sat at the table with their own secrets.
0:30:30|0:30:34|[Wang Damao] first looked at [Fang Pian], then turned to look at [Hong Tao].
0:30:35|0:30:42|Then all three of them looked at [Shun Zi] at the same time, but [Shun Zi] turned his head to the side, indicating that he did not want to get involved in their grievances.
0:30:42|0:30:46|The three of them dared not act rashly. Unable to bear the atmosphere, [Wang Damao] spoke to [Fang Pian].
0:30:49|0:30:59|Master, Wang Damao did not move his chopsticks after listening, but turned his head thoughtfully towards Hong Tao, then said.
0:31:7|0:31:21|Wang Damao's gaze shifted from Mrs. Da to a bowl of noodles on the table. He picked up the chopsticks and noodles, but made no move to eat. Instead, he turned the conversation towards Fang Butler.
0:31:21|0:31:25|[Wang Damao] placed the noodles in front of [Fang Pian], who had a fake smile on his face.
0:31:30|0:31:36|[Fang Butler] couldn't maintain the fake smile on his face after hearing that, he watched as [Wang Damao] turned his head to look at the noodles on the table.
0:31:36|0:31:46|It took a while for [Shun Zi] and [Wang Damao] to pick up their noodles and chopsticks. They nervously swallowed their saliva as they watched [Fang Pian]'s actions, knowing the truth.
0:31:55|0:32:1|[Fang Butler] opened his mouth, about to put the noodles in, but quickly stopped when he heard the words.
0:32:1|0:32:8|[Fang Butler] then cast a grateful glance at her, while [Wang Damao] and [Shun Zi] both watched [Mrs. Da] for her next move.
0:32:24|0:32:41|[Wang Damao] and Mrs. Wang forced [Fang Butler] to eat noodles. [Fang Butler] looked at their serious faces, then lowered his head to look at the noodles in his hand. Determined, he was about to put the noodles into his mouth when suddenly gunshots were heard outside the door, startling everyone. All eyes turned towards the door, where two soldiers were holding rifles.
0:32:55|0:32:59|[Wang Damao], [Fang Pian], and [Shun Zi] walked over.
0:32:59|0:33:3|Mrs. Wang is hiding behind the wall.
0:33:3|0:33:10|The shorter soldier finished speaking, looked at the three in front of him, then walked up to [Wang Damao] and asked.
0:33:19|0:33:35|Soldier Jia asked Shun Zi, who nodded. Soldier Jia then asked Fang Pian and received a satisfactory answer. Soldier Jia then looked at Wang Damao and asked.
0:33:35|0:33:37|[Wang Damao] was slapped by the soldier because of his ignorance.
0:33:41|0:33:49|Soldier Ai walked up to [Shun Zi] and asked.
0:33:49|0:33:57|Then he walked slowly to [Wang Damao] and prepared to ask questions.
0:33:57|0:34:0|After hearing Wang Damao's words, Soldier Jia walked up to Shun Zi and asked.
0:34:22|0:34:26|The short official asked the three people.
0:34:26|0:34:32|[Wang Damao] and [Fang Pian] each took a step back, while the short soldier stood still, but it was [Shun Zi] in front who asked.
0:35:8|0:35:17|After speaking, the two soldiers walked towards the door, while the steward Fang sent the guests off obsequiously. Madam Wang watched everything behind the wall, and Shun Zi immediately knelt down upon hearing Wang Damao's words.
0:35:21|0:35:29|Just as [Wang Damao] raised his hand to hit [Shun Zi], the soldier who had just left kicked the door open and came back.
0:35:32|0:35:33|The short official asked [Shun Zi].
0:35:48|0:35:55|Two soldiers chased after Wang Damao and arrived at the mess hall. After a brief chase, they both stared blankly at the three bowls of noodles on the table.
0:35:55|0:36:7|The soldiers put down their guns and sat at the table. [Shun Zi], the steward, and Mrs. Wang Damao all came to the kitchen. They watched as the soldiers started to eat noodles and couldn't help but shout, startling the soldiers.
0:36:17|0:36:25|The soldiers were stunned by this roar, they didn't listen to any persuasion.
0:36:25|0:36:31|Wang Damao picked up the bowl again, and Mrs. Wang raised her hand, making a three gesture.
0:36:31|0:36:52|Two soldiers faced each other, and after speaking, they picked up the noodles to eat. The soldiers aimed their guns at them, [Wang Damao] and the others were scared stiff and didn't dare to move. The soldiers then started eating the noodles heartily, and after finishing, they prepared to leave.
0:36:52|0:36:54|Several people bowed to the soldiers.
0:37:2|0:37:14|The two soldiers had not even walked out the gate when the poison took effect. They suddenly knelt down on the ground, convulsing uncontrollably. [Wang Damao] and the others bowed halfway, quickly went forward to check. [Shun Zi] leaned in to check the soldiers' breathing and said.
0:37:17|0:37:20|There was a pause, and then he continued.
0:37:55|0:38:0|After Shun Zi finished speaking, Wang Damao and Fang Pian looked back, only to find other servants from the house behind them.
0:38:3|0:38:24|Servants holding torches, [Wang Damao] and the others looked at each other in silence. By morning, [Wang Damao] hurriedly packed some clothes, account books, and several silver dollars into a bundle, planning to run away. As he stepped out of the door, he froze in place, seeing [Fang Pian], [Shun Zi], the mistress, and [Chun Tian] standing at the doorway. Seeing his reaction, [Shun Zi] spoke up.
0:38:43|0:38:52|The words were weighty and profound, [Fang Pian] and [Shun Zi] helplessly lowered their heads, while Mrs. Wang and [Chun Tian] looked disdainful.
0:39:4|0:39:10|[Shun Zi] turned his head and looked at the big lady next to him, who twisted her body with a look of disdain.
0:39:39|0:39:44|Madam Wang interrupted Wang Damao unhappily, and Wang Damao approached her and said seriously.
0:39:57|0:40:3|[Fang Butler] hesitated for a moment, lowered his head, and [Wang Damao] walked towards the door with his luggage on his back, followed by the other four.
0:40:15|0:40:22|[Fang Butler] hesitated to shout, and when [Wang Damao] heard it, he stopped in his tracks and turned to look at him.
0:40:22|0:40:27|At this moment, [Butler Fang] hurried to [Wang Damao]'s side, and the two looked at each other.
0:40:27|0:40:30|After a while, Butler [Fang Pian] spoke up.
0:40:30|0:40:34|He reached out and straightened Wang Damao's clothes, saying tenderly.
0:40:41|0:40:46|[Fang Pian]'s words as the steward were touching, but [Wang Damao] remained ungrateful.
0:40:46|0:41:2|[Wang Damao] finished scolding the steward [Fang Pian], then turned and walked towards the door. But as soon as he reached the door, it was kicked open, and a gun was pointed at [Wang Damao]. He had to slowly step back as two soldiers entered, one of them asking him a question.
0:42:0|0:42:5|With these words, the soldiers looked at them in disbelief.
0:42:5|0:42:7|Wang Damao answers.
0:42:25|0:42:29|The soldiers, satisfied with the answer, turned and left.
0:42:29|0:42:35|Who knew they would see Mrs. Wang Damao leaning against the wall, and the two of them asked in a sly manner.
0:42:35|0:42:42|Mrs. Wang Damao said hesitantly.
0:42:42|0:42:45|[Fang Pian] the steward stood by with a blue face, while Soldier Jia asked [Chun Tian].
0:42:50|0:42:57|After speaking, the soldiers walked towards [Chun Tian].
0:42:57|0:43:9|[Shun Zi] stops the soldiers and then stands in front of the two soldiers.
0:43:9|0:43:14|The soldiers looked at [Chun Tian], then glanced at [Shun Zi] with confusion, and then asked.
0:43:18|0:43:23|The two soldiers looked at each other, then turned to the uneasy Chun Tian, while Mrs. Wang watched from the side.
0:43:23|0:43:27|Who knew, the soldiers turned their gaze towards her, raising their eyebrows slightly.
0:43:42|0:43:51|Mrs. Wang snorted coldly at these words, swaying her figure as she walked into the house, while the butler [Fang Pian] watched this scene from behind the wall, feeling very angry.
0:43:51|0:43:54|He disappeared from the screen, not knowing what he had in mind.
0:43:54|0:44:1|Two soldiers holding guns threateningly, Mrs. Wang entered the room. As she walked to the bedside, Mrs. Wang suddenly turned to look at them.
0:44:20|0:44:26|Two soldiers saw Mrs. Wang like this, both put down their guns and looked at each other, then walked towards Mrs. Wang.
0:44:33|0:44:40|The soldier turned his head in confusion and saw the big lady who appeared next to [Fang Pian] the steward.
0:44:40|0:44:46|Housekeeper Fang embraces Mrs. Damao and blows her a kiss, while [Wang Damao] watches from outside, his mouth twisted in anger.
0:44:48|0:45:0|Two soldiers watched the situation and joined forces to grab their guns. [Fang Pian] immediately pushed the big lady in his arms away, took a kitchen knife and tried to chop the hands of the two soldiers who were about to grab the guns, but was rushed by the soldiers.
0:45:0|0:45:9|Next, [Fang Butler] angrily took a kitchen knife and chopped towards the faces of the soldiers, then towards the middle of the two, followed by chopping towards the crotch and waist of the two.
0:45:10|0:45:16|The soldiers dodged one after another, and finally found the right moment to kick [Fang Pian] in the waist, sending him flying out.
0:45:16|0:45:23|The fallen [Fang Butler] didn't have time to check his own injuries. He immediately picked up the kitchen knife at hand and stood up to attack the soldiers.
0:45:23|0:45:30|Who knew, as soon as he turned around, he froze in place and dared not move, while the two soldiers had already aimed their guns at [Fang Pian]'s crotch.
0:45:40|0:45:48|Two soldiers rushed out of the door, while on the other side, Shun Zi and Chun Tian had already run out of the village, Wang Damao and others also followed and ran out of Wang's house.
0:45:48|0:45:51|The soldiers went out of the door, looked around, and said.
0:45:51|0:45:57|The soldiers rushed to chase after the people, and [Wang Damao] and others in the house also ran out to join the team chasing after [Shun Zi] and [Chun Tian].
0:46:3|0:46:14|[Shun Zi] and [Chun Tian] ran into the woods, with a large group of people chasing after them. The soldiers couldn't hold back and fired two shots at them.
0:46:14|0:46:33|The soldiers followed all the way to the snack street next to the human and heavenly realms. They passed by Pan Jinlianzi Island, and then passed four strangely dressed vendors. The four vendors stared at them with ill intentions. After the soldiers left, they rolled their eyes and left the stall, while [Shun Zi] and [Chun Tian] also peeked out from behind the stall.
0:47:30|0:47:34|[Wang Damao] led the mediocre people into the human world and heaven, followed by orders.
0:47:34|0:47:41|Under Wang Damao's command, the ordinary people ran in different directions to search. Shun Zi followed Chun Tian to the room where he used to live.
0:47:49|0:47:59|[Shun Zi] and [Chun Tian] looked at each other, then [Shun Zi] tiptoed over to the edge, slowly picked up [Chun Tian]'s father's qin, and the two of them planned to leave quickly.
0:47:59|0:48:3|Just as they were about to go downstairs, they saw [Wang Damao] looking for someone downstairs.
0:48:7|0:48:15|[Wang Damao] and the servants went upstairs together, even entered a room with [Chun Tian], then quickly closed the door and ran towards the room.
0:48:15|0:48:20|Later, [Wang Damao] and others opened the door and swaggered into the room.
0:48:29|0:48:45|Several people rushed forward and began beating the two people on the bed. While [Shun Zi] and [Chun Tian] tried to escape in the chaos, suddenly a gunshot rang out, startling everyone present. They saw a smoking hole in someone's back, then [Old K] emerged from under the blanket and shouted loudly.
0:48:52|0:49:0|The girls all ran out from heaven and earth, with [Shun Zi] and [Chun Tian] taking advantage of the chaos to run away. [Wang Damao] and the others followed behind, relentlessly chasing after them.
0:49:5|0:49:10|[Shun Zi] and [Chun Tian] were exhausted and couldn't run anymore, so they gave up escaping and rested in place.
0:49:10|0:49:13|[Wang Damao] and others caught up, panting on the side.
0:49:32|0:49:38|At this moment, [Wang Damao] in Dawang Village was still unaware of the seriousness of the situation.
0:49:38|0:49:43|He sat in the main seat of the room with the big wife, and standing beside them was the butler [Fang Pian].
0:49:43|0:49:49|After a while, [Wang Damao] began to interrogate the captured [Shun Zi] and [Chun Tian].
0:50:7|0:50:13|The steward [Fang Pian] and the mistress, who were just arrogant, suddenly became timid and started banging the table in anger at [Wang Damao].
0:50:34|0:50:40|Mrs. Wang Damao said indignantly.
0:50:40|0:50:44|[Wang Damao] lifted up the sneaky face of [Fang Pian] with his hand and said.
0:50:55|0:50:59|[Wang Damao] flicked the face of [Fang Pian] the steward with his hand, sat up straight, and addressed everyone.
0:51:18|0:51:22|[Wang Damao] turned around and looked at the people in the room, then spoke.
0:51:27|0:51:39|He bent down and looked at the kneeling butler [Fang Pian], then said ominously.
0:51:39|0:51:42|Fang Pian's steward, after hearing these words, fell straight to the ground.
0:51:47|0:51:52|[Wang Damao] glanced at the big lady, then took a few steps forward and spoke to [Shun Zi] and [Chun Tian].
0:52:36|0:52:43|[Wang Damao] kicked the steward of [Fang Pian] to the ground, while [Shun Zi] and [Chun Tian] were talking in the corner.
0:53:17|0:53:28|The soldiers kicked open the door of Wang's mansion, then a large number of soldiers entered the mansion. At the end of the team, with two soldiers, the deputy officer in the middle shouted.
0:53:28|0:53:35|[Shun Zi] walked in front wearing a luxurious robe, followed by [Wang Damao] and others, with the adjutant looking at them and asking.
0:53:54|0:53:56|The soldiers who had been to Wang's house before pointed at [Shun Zi].
0:54:1|0:54:7|[Shun Zi] looked at the deputy firmly, and the deputy walked up to him, patting his shoulder, saying.
0:54:18|0:54:24|[Shun Zi] was about to be taken away by the soldiers, when [Chun Tian] stepped forward and called out to him.
0:54:24|0:54:36|[Shun Zi] turned around and looked at [Chun Tian] after hearing, while [Chun Tian] ran towards him regardless, the two embraced tightly in front of everyone's eyes, as if this parting was a farewell forever.
0:54:36|0:54:42|Wang Damao looked at the scene in front of him with a pale face and lowered his head, while the steward of [Fang Pian] shook his head with a look of regret.
0:54:43|0:54:47|The two embracing figures looked like a beautiful yet tragic painting.
0:54:59|0:55:3|Step back from the embrace of [Chun Tian], [Shun Zi] decisively turns and leaves.
0:55:3|0:55:6|Shortly after, a large number of soldiers also left Wang's residence.
0:55:6|0:55:9|[Chun Tian] stood still, tears in her eyes, watching the back of [Shun Zi].
0:55:9|0:55:15|Who knew, just after [Shun Zi] and Soldier Jia left, [Wang Damao] started to have some crooked ideas like many others.
0:55:26|0:55:33|At night, in a mansion guarded by many soldiers, there is a tiger in the center of the courtyard chained with an iron chain.
0:55:33|0:55:38|Facing him directly, a man stood in the prison cell enduring the lashes of the whip.
0:55:38|0:55:42|On the other side, [Wang Damao] sat in front of a room with the character for "happiness" on it, drinking.
0:55:42|0:55:46|He, who was about to enter the bridal chamber, burst into laughter joyfully.
0:55:46|0:55:49|The servants in the house were all bare-shouldered and relatively silent.
0:55:49|0:55:54|[Chun Tian] is in the room, playing the pipa as if going to die.
0:55:54|0:56:1|With the sound of the pipa fading away, in another room, the man who was beaten lifted his head, revealing the leader of all the soldiers, [Old K].
0:56:28|0:56:31|Old K and Shun Zi kneel down together facing the gun barrels.
0:56:33|0:56:49|Old K slammed the wine in front of him, and Shun Zi turned his head in confusion and asked him, General.
0:57:11|0:57:14|The servants stood bare-shouldered in Wang Damao's courtyard.
0:57:14|0:57:19|[Wang Damao] sat in the center of the courtyard, listening to the butler [Fang Pian] holding the dowry sent by everyone.
0:57:19|0:57:24|Mrs. Liu is in the room, pouring the gold gun cloth into the wine while cursing.
0:57:36|0:57:40|[Chun Tian] is dressed in festive attire, kneeling in front of her father's pipa, crying and pleading.
0:57:40|0:57:44|Outside the door, [Wang Damao] is still immersed in the joy of his new marriage.
0:58:19|0:58:29|A large number of soldiers rushed into Wang Damao's house, with the deputy officer leading Shun Zi in with a smile, looking at the "happiness" characters posted everywhere in the courtyard.
0:58:29|0:58:32|[Fang Pian] the steward quickly stepped forward and bowed to the deputy, saying.
0:58:36|0:58:38|The deputy officer looked at [Shun Zi] in surprise.
0:58:42|0:58:58|The deputy suddenly turned his head towards Wang Damao after hearing the steward Fang Pian's words.
0:58:58|0:59:4|He walked steadily towards him with sharp eyes, then bent down and stared at him, asking.
0:59:17|0:59:30|The steward of Fang Pian was startled by these words, and the deputy looked at the crowd in the yard, pointing at Shun Zi. The crowd looked in the direction the deputy pointed without saying a word. Impatiently, the deputy shouted, "That's right."
1:0:0|1:0:4|[Wang Damao] voiced his opposition, and immediately the deputy threatened.
1:0:5|1:0:8|[Wang Damao] had to agree under the sternness of the deputy officer.
1:0:13|1:0:18|The deputy's gaze turned to the wine glass on the table, and he picked it up and asked [Wang Damao].
1:0:23|1:0:29|Lifting the wine glass and finishing it in one gulp, Mrs. Wang was stunned by his boldness.
1:0:46|1:0:53|[Fang Pian] the steward led the deputy and two soldiers to the backyard, while the deputy whispered instructions to his subordinates as they walked.
1:1:46|1:1:57|[Wang Damao] stopped [Shun Zi] who wanted to confess, then walked to his side and paused, took two more steps, looked outside the door, and finally stood in front of [Shun Zi], looking anxious, and said.
1:1:59|1:2:4|Wang Damao then turned to the lady of the house and the servants at home.
1:2:19|1:2:26|Mrs. Wang Damao wanted to retort, but after a moment's thought, she shyly and hesitantly said.
1:2:26|1:2:42|Mrs. Damao finished speaking, shyly shook her fan and twisted her waist as she left the room. Wang Damao looked at her in confusion. In the backyard house, Chun Tian, who had been rescued, lay on a fainting bed. She woke up groggily and, upon opening her eyes, found three people in military uniforms in front of her, causing her to sit up in shock.
1:2:58|1:3:4|Shuntian was pressed down by the soldiers in the room where [Wang Damao] and [Shun Zi] were located.
1:3:4|1:3:6|He turned his head to look when he heard someone calling his name.
1:3:8|1:3:13|[Chun Tian] pushed away [Chun Tian]'s hand and then put his arm around his shoulder, walking towards the soldiers.
1:3:41|1:3:47|[Chun Tian] looked at the soldiers in front of him and immediately understood what [Shun Zi] meant, then reluctantly hugged him.
1:4:12|1:4:15|[Chun Tian] leans on Shengzi's shoulder and talks to him.
1:4:27|1:4:29|The deputy officer outside the house launched an attack.
1:4:29|1:4:34|His body was overheated, fanning himself was no use, so he could only resort to hitting the wall to relieve it.
1:4:34|1:4:37|He suddenly realized that the wedding wine he drank today was not right.
1:4:44|1:5:1|As soon as the words fell, [Wang Damao] walked past with her arms bare and wearing a bellyband. The adjutant's eyes stared straight at [Wang Damao]'s back, and he secretly leered at her from behind until his face turned red. He stopped, still looking in the direction she left, his lips trembling slightly.
1:5:1|1:5:4|The hand holding the fan naturally hangs down.
1:5:4|1:5:17|Coincidentally, a comical scene appeared on the ground, with the shadow of the fan perfectly imprinted on her crotch. At this moment, [Wang Damao] was sitting cross-legged on the bed in a bad mood, while [Mrs. Damao] walked towards her, fanning herself, showing concern.
1:5:38|1:5:44|The deputy officer who entered the room saw this scene and his nose started bleeding.
1:5:44|1:5:55|The scene cuts to [Shun Zi], who is frowning as he sits in the main seat. He turns to look at the deputy officer sitting next to him, who is bleeding from the nose and then shouts loudly.
1:5:55|1:5:58|He continued slowly while sitting in the chair.
1:6:4|1:6:9|The deputy officer pulled out a pistol and handed it to [Shun Zi] with a sharp look.
1:6:11|1:6:21|[Shun Zi] picked up the gun on the table and aimed it directly at the kneeling [Wang Damao], but unexpectedly turned the gun towards the deputy officer, startling everyone.
1:6:29|1:6:30|Then look at [Wang Damao].
1:7:1|1:7:6|[Wang Damao] was sweating profusely while pulling the wood, but the steward [Fang Pian] was standing aside with a smile on his face.
1:7:6|1:7:9|Finally, he collapsed to the ground in tears and fell asleep.
1:7:9|1:7:15|Just as he entered the wooden box, someone spoke up and woke him up.
1:7:15|1:7:22|He woke up from his sleep, looked up with a bewildered expression at the newcomer, only to see that Xianxian's jade hand was holding out a steamed bun to him.
1:7:24|1:7:31|[Wang Damao] looked at the steamed bun in front of him, swallowed, then picked it up with both hands and said, tilting his head.
1:7:35|1:7:39|[Chun Tian], dressed in luxury, slowly squatted down and said.
1:8:1|1:8:4|[Chun Tian] pushes away [Wang Damao]'s hand and says.
1:8:38|1:8:53|[Wang Damao] spoke heartfelt words to [Chun Tian], promising to give him a good life. Unaware that he had been tricked, he believed that his hidden wealth couldn't be found by anyone, but on that very day, [Shun Zi] received a tip-off and had the treasure dug up.
1:8:53|1:8:59|[Shun Zi] divides the money among the poor servants who have long been exploited by [Wang Damao], allowing them to take the money back and live a better life.
1:9:0|1:9:17|Night falls, [Hong Tao] dressed in gorgeous clothes and a bright robe, sneaks out of her room. She looks around cautiously, then quietly makes her way to the kitchen. Swiftly, she opens the door and steps inside, carefully closing it behind her.
1:9:18|1:9:29|When making sure that no one was watching, Wang Damao turned his head to look at the people in the room. He saw the butler Fang Pian standing there shirtless, with a long bell hanging around his neck, wearing large underpants, and a hat on his head, facing away from Hong Tao.
1:9:29|1:9:35|She slightly lowered her head, one hand holding onto her hat, while the other hand naturally hung down, freezing the posture.
1:9:35|1:9:43|At this moment, the vinyl record player starts playing music. She throws her hat off directly and then her body starts moving to the music.
1:9:43|1:9:47|[Hong Tao] watched his dancing figure, and her body started to sway along.
1:9:47|1:9:52|[Fang Pian] turned around to look at [Hong Tao], and threw a flirtatious glance at her.
1:9:52|1:10:0|[Hong Tao] stood with one hand on her hip, the other hand lightly brushing past her own lips in a seductive gesture, while the butler [Fang Pian] excitedly swung a long bell.
1:10:0|1:10:4|[Hong Tao] also flicked the hat in her hand and hooked it with a finger.
1:10:4|1:10:9|Next, the two climbed onto the dining table and started moving towards the center from both sides.
1:10:9|1:10:28|As they climbed and made gestures to seduce each other, just as the two were about to get close, suddenly a pistol appeared in front of them. The deputy head, wearing the hat that [Wang Damao] had just thrown, exclaimed in shock.
1:11:4|1:11:8|The deputy officer immediately took out a knife and started cutting a cucumber, which frightened [Fang Pian] into screaming.
1:11:8|1:11:10|The next day, the soldiers reported to the deputy officer.
1:11:23|1:11:27|The deputy drank the wine in the bowl and then rinsed the bowl on the table.
1:11:33|1:11:38|The scene shifts, with Old K glaring fiercely at Shun Zi, gritting his teeth.
1:12:1|1:12:19|[Wang Damao] and [Fang Pian] were talking face to face, with the distressed [Fang Pian] looking down at his crotch and bursting into tears.
1:12:19|1:12:24|[Wang Damao] crawled on the ground towards [Fang Pian], the two of them struggling to conspire a rebellion.
1:12:41|1:12:52|The two of them reached an agreement and looked in the same direction, their faces one thin and one round, forming a contrast like yin and yang. They saw a curved wood-cutting knife at the place where their eyes were fixed.
1:13:1|1:13:7|[Old K] points a gun at [Shun Zi].
1:13:7|1:13:11|At this moment, [Wang Damao] and [Fang Pian] burst into the room with curved knives.
1:13:11|1:13:15|The two of them knelt down and offered the curved knives with both hands.
1:13:58|1:14:9|[Old K] menacingly threatened [Wang Damao] and [Shun Zi], as he had rigged a fist-sized landmine on the ceiling beam and tied [Shun Zi] and [Wang Damao] to pillars on either side of the landmine.
1:14:9|1:14:17|As the fuse of the landmine was lit, [Wang Damao] became more and more anxious. In the moment before the landmine was about to explode, he gasped for breath, screamed, and closed his eyes.
1:14:18|1:14:21|Half a howl, but the imagined explosion did not occur.
1:14:21|1:14:27|[Wang Damao] and [Shun Zi] opened their eyes, only to see the burning fuse in front of them, while the landmine remained unharmed.
1:15:10|1:15:16|[Fang Pian's butler] nodded in agreement, watched as [Wang Damao] left, then turned his eyes around and stared hard at [Shun Zi].
1:15:40|1:15:53|[Shun Zi] was tied to a beam in the courtyard by the steward [Fang Pian], while the mistress [Hong Tao] was dressed in a blue and white porcelain cheongsam, draped in a short silk cape, holding a sharp knife in her hand. She walked towards the two with a determined gaze, her flowing embroidered hair swaying gently in the breeze.
1:16:55|1:17:4|The furious [Fang Pian steward], disregarding everything, fiercely competes for the dagger in the hands of the mistress, intending to use it to kill [Shun Zi] and end the recent absurd feud.
1:17:4|1:17:12|The lady, moved by the sincere love of [Shun Zi] and [Chun Tian], also exerted all her efforts to protect the love she never had but longed for deeply.
1:17:12|1:17:18|The two were pulling each other in the courtyard, but unexpectedly, in a moment of carelessness, the dagger pierced into [Hong Tao]'s body.
1:17:18|1:17:28|Housekeeper Fang stared blankly at the injury of [Hong Tao], watching the flowing blood and the slow passing of Mrs. Wang's [Hong Tao] life.
1:17:28|1:17:31|Mrs. Damao leaned softly in the arms of Mr. Fang, the steward.
1:18:7|1:18:10|Shun Zi looked at the scene and sighed with a furrowed brow.
1:18:25|1:18:29|With the butler Fang's roar, the scene shifts to the Wang family ancestral grave.
1:18:31|1:18:35|To their surprise, the bodies of two soldiers who had died from poisoning were among them.
1:19:4|1:19:8|He then walked slowly and solemnly towards the bed with a serious expression.
1:19:8|1:19:13|[Old K] and his men also raised their guns, vigilantly following behind [Wang Damao].
1:19:13|1:19:24|Approaching the bed, [Wang Damao] hesitated for a moment, then as if making a firm decision, suddenly pulled back the bed curtain and took out a rifle from the dark drawer beside the bed, screaming as he turned and aimed at [Old K].
1:19:24|1:19:28|The soldiers present were shocked into silence by this sudden turn of events.
1:19:29|1:19:36|Seeing the man in front of him, sweating profusely and unable to catch his breath, Old K knew that the desperate [Wang Damao] was capable of anything.
1:20:40|1:20:46|Following Shun Zi's memories, the scene cuts to the moment when Fang Pian's steward swung a knife towards himself.
1:20:46|1:20:49|The sword was swung, but the arm froze in mid-air.
1:20:58|1:21:8|Turning to look at the gate, we saw the other servants of [Wang Damao] bare-chested, each holding tools in their hands, such as shovels, sickles, hammers, and wooden sticks.
1:21:8|1:21:12|Seeing this scene, [Old K] walked towards them with a short knife in his hand.
1:21:12|1:21:18|On ordinary days, the servants who usually bow and scrape before him now faced his fierce gaze without fear.
1:21:32|1:21:42|Wang Damao rushed out of the room and stopped in front of Shun Zi. He looked to both sides and found that everyone was shirtless and holding weapons.
1:21:43|1:22:1|They gathered in large numbers, menacingly behind [Shun Zi]. [Wang Damao] was frightened by this formation, silently retreating backwards. Seeing the timid [Wang Damao] in front of him, [Shun Zi] glared angrily and continued to approach him. The mediocre people behind him also followed step by step, feeling the overwhelming momentum in front of them.
1:22:1|1:22:8|Fearless [Shun Zi] and the ordinary people, [Wang Damao] tremblingly raised the rifle above his head and then knelt down in submission.
1:22:8|1:22:10|Upon seeing this scene, [Old K] inside the house shouted angrily.
1:22:12|1:22:24|Old K gave a command, and his henchmen around him immediately raised their long spears to form a barrier in front of him.
1:22:24|1:22:32|Shun Zi faced such a serious situation without a trace of fear on his face, but instead crossed his hands in front of his chest like a surging bamboo.
1:22:32|1:22:47|The gaze of [Old K] was fixed on, although he was holding a gun, he dared not act rashly, only confronting each other. [Chun Tian] was on top of a tall building, watching the scene in front of him, and also playing the pipa. This music made the already tense confrontation even more severe.
1:22:48|1:22:54|At this moment, the servants blocking the door dispersed to both sides in unison, creating a passage in the middle.
1:22:54|1:22:58|[Old K] fixed his gaze and saw that the newcomer was none other than the [Butler of Fang Pian], who was bare-chested.
1:22:58|1:23:7|He was seen wearing a top hat, holding a grenade the size of a head in his hand, swaggering towards [Old K].
1:23:7|1:23:9|In the sunlight, his figure appeared particularly majestic.
1:23:10|1:23:15|He walked slowly towards [Wang Damao] under everyone's gaze, and casually tossed his hat aside.
1:23:15|1:23:21|Under the gaze of [Old K], he placed the landmine in his hand on the head of [Wang Damao] who was kneeling on the ground.
1:23:21|1:23:25|Wang Damao, who was already in a state of defeat, was even more frightened and dared not move when he saw this scene.
1:23:25|1:23:29|[Fang Pian] the butler, after placing the landmine, calmly warmed himself on the side.
1:23:29|1:23:33|He moved his wrist and then bent down to touch the soil on the ground with both hands.
1:23:34|1:23:40|Next, he stood up straight, clapped his hands, and shouted, picking up a landmine from [Wang Damao]'s head.
1:23:40|1:23:49|In full view of everyone, [Fang Pian] the butler fearlessly aimed at his own several long spears, and like throwing a thousand balls, he threw grenades towards [Old K]'s direction.
1:23:50|1:24:2|Just as the landmine was still rolling in the air, [Shun Zi] acted swiftly and kicked the gun on top of [Wang Damao]'s head into the air. Then, he somersaulted in the air a few times and skillfully caught the gun.
1:24:2|1:24:11|[Shun Zi], like a sharpshooter, actually pulled the trigger, aimed, and fired in one fell swoop as soon as he landed, accurately shooting a bullet towards the flying landmine.
1:24:12|1:24:24|The bullets chased the landmine in the air, and when the landmine reached Old K, the bullets behind also hit it just right. Amid the screams of Old K and his many henchmen, the landmine was detonated.
1:24:24|1:24:29|With the explosion of the landmine, it also heralded the victory of the people led by [Chun Tian].
1:24:29|1:24:38|After going through numerous hardships, they finally defeated the foreign powers, and a proud expression gradually appeared on their faces.
