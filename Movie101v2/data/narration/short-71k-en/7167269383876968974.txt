0:0:41|0:0:51|Accompanied by the sound of music, the scene gradually reveals a white lighthouse standing by the sea, which looks particularly tall and beautiful under the sun.
0:0:51|0:1:0|Around the lighthouse, only two or three seagulls were circling, emitting cries from time to time, while the waves kept surging on the sea, as if competing with the seagulls on the sea surface.
0:1:2|0:1:18|In the distance, the mountains under the setting sun are reflected by the lighthouse, and the boats sailing on the sea seem to merge with the water. Seagulls fly in the sky at a higher altitude, creating an incredibly beautiful ink painting.
0:1:18|0:1:23|With the shift of the camera, the panoramic view of the town by the mountains and waters gradually appears on the screen.
0:1:23|0:1:30|Looking down from the sky, the buildings in the seaside town are surprisingly neatly arranged, with cars shuttling back and forth among them.
0:1:33|0:1:39|The surrounding buildings clustered together, and some were even built halfway up the mountain.
0:1:39|0:1:45|From here, you can see the lighthouse and the sea under the setting sun in the distance.
0:1:45|0:1:54|The vast sea surface ripples with the gentle breeze, the distant lighthouse stands out prominently, while seagulls soar tirelessly in the sunset.
0:1:54|0:2:0|With the appearance of the seaside town in the scene, the five characters of "Qindao City, China" slowly appear in the bottom right corner of the screen.
0:2:2|0:2:14|At this moment, the scene suddenly cuts to inside a building in Qin Island City, where the anti-drug police officer [Zhou Chao] and his colleagues are observing outside the suspect's house.
0:2:22|0:2:24|[Zhou Chao] was about to get up, but was forced back by the sound of gunshots.
0:2:29|0:2:34|[Zhou Chao] rushed outside randomly, while his teammates were fighting with the suspect.
0:2:34|0:2:40|[Zhou Chao] walked towards the wall under his cover, only to find a suspect jumping out of the window and escaping.
0:2:40|0:2:49|On the other side, the other suspects have been ambushed and taken down by the surrounding police, while [Zhou Chao] is chasing the fleeing suspect into the alley.
0:2:49|0:2:58|Suddenly the phone rang, [Zhou Chao] had no time to spare. He lunged forward, grabbing the suspect and throwing him to the ground, and the two began to wrestle.
0:2:58|0:2:59|Teammates come to support.
0:3:1|0:3:8|Zhou Chao finally took out his phone. At this moment, the scene switched to Tokyo, Japan, where Zhou Kai and Ma Ke were walking in a restaurant.
0:3:22|0:3:25|[Zhou Kai] was on the phone when he was pushed by someone.
0:3:35|0:3:40|He glanced at the people around him who were talking in whispers, and the two of them continued to walk into the store.
0:3:51|0:4:3|While ordering food, [Ma Ke] suddenly smiled and looked to the side, then got up and left.
0:4:3|0:4:8|[Zhou Kai] put down his phone and took off his jacket, seeing [Ma Ke] talking to a man with long hair and black clothes.
0:4:8|0:4:13|At this moment, the sumo wrestling match in the store is about to begin, and [Ma Ke] promptly returns to his seat.
0:4:26|0:4:37|[Zhou Kai] turned his head helplessly, the competition on stage was reaching its climax, with two people wrestling fiercely, when suddenly another contestant was brought down to the ground.
0:4:45|0:5:4|The crowd stopped laughing and looked at [Ma Ke], but then burst into laughter at his funny antics. [Ma Ke] couldn't help but laugh too, then sat down and raised his glass to signal to [Zhou Kai].
0:5:4|0:5:8|At this moment, the four big characters of the movie title "A Better Tomorrow" appeared in the center of the screen.
0:5:21|0:5:24|The police are questioning inside, [Zhou Chao] and others have just finished questioning the suspect.
0:5:24|0:5:31|In Tokyo, on the other side, Zhou Kai and Ma Ke, led by Pi Jing, go to meet the Japanese smuggling leader, Okamura.
0:5:31|0:5:33|Gangcun is soaking in the hot spring in the courtyard at this moment.
0:5:58|0:6:3|Gangcun's attendants brought fruit for the three of them, while he sat on the bank from the water and lit a pipe nearby.
0:6:8|0:6:12|He took a puff of his cigarette, lifted the tobacco pouch, and offered it to the three of them.
0:6:12|0:6:15|Rubber Band was about to step forward, but was pulled back by Zhou Kai.
0:6:15|0:6:19|Gangcun immediately put down the tobacco pouch, and the attendant continued to massage his shoulders.
0:6:26|0:6:29|Soon after, the group entered the private room to have a meal.
0:6:37|0:6:37|Gang Cun said,
0:7:1|0:7:4|To everyone's surprise, Gangcun suddenly took out a pistol and placed it on the table.
0:7:11|0:7:18|At this moment, [Rubber Band] sensed the tension and gestured for [Zhou Kai] and the others to sit down.
0:7:22|0:7:29|[Zhou Chao] glanced at the three people in the hall, then picked up the gun, loaded it, kicked the dining table with his foot, and then scolded the three of them.
0:7:34|0:7:40|Rubber Band picked up the wine glass that had been kicked over on the table and glanced at Zhou Kai, who had a serious expression.
0:7:40|0:7:44|[Zhou Kai] and [Ma Ke] looked at Gangcun in silence.
0:7:44|0:7:50|[Zhou Kai] pondered for a moment, picked up the toothpick on the table and examined it carefully, then handed it to Gangcun.
0:7:50|0:7:54|Indicating that he is stabbing himself, [Ma Ke] stared solemnly at Gangcun.
0:7:54|0:7:58|Tension rose as Ma Ke and Rubber Band both focused intently.
0:8:1|0:8:6|[Zhou Chao] took the toothpick from [Zhou Kai] without saying a word, and looked him up and down.
0:8:6|0:8:13|[Zhou Kai] saw no response from him, so he took the initiative to move closer to [Zhou Chao], indicating that he would not blink.
0:8:13|0:8:24|[Zhou Chao] then picked up a toothpick and aimed it at [Zhou Kai], getting closer little by little. [Rubber Band] looked increasingly nervous, while [Ma Ke] kept staring at the just-village.
0:8:24|0:8:28|At a critical moment, to everyone's surprise, [Zhou Chao] dropped the toothpick and spoke up.
0:8:33|0:8:36|[Rubber Band] is muscular, only then does he relax his tense body.
0:8:36|0:8:38|[Zhou Kai] looked at [Gangcun], and both of them smiled.
0:8:44|0:8:49|The next morning, a group of seagulls flew over the sea, and the scene shifted to the bustling port.
0:8:49|0:8:55|The port is bustling with activity as the orderly row of cranes on the shore is busy moving cargo.
0:8:55|0:9:2|There are three or four workers inspecting the goods and trucks transporting them around, while a cargo ship is anchored at sea.
0:9:2|0:9:9|Trucks coming and going along the shore, carrying goods, while [Zhou Kai] and [Ma Ke] are inspecting the cargo at this port.
0:9:59|0:10:12|On the other side, [Ma Ke] is chatting with the sailors outside. The sailor asks him how many times he has been successful recently. Ma Ke proudly draws three with his hand, sarcastically saying, "Who's like you?" Then he adds, "I heard you guys are having a harder time."
0:10:12|0:10:22|Before long, [Rubber Band] boarded the ship, and the crew greeted him, saying it had been a long time since they last met. Soon after, the ship sounded its horn and officially set sail from the port in Japan.
0:10:22|0:10:33|Two days later, in Qingdao City Hospital, [Zhou Chao] slowly opened his eyes by the bedside, he glanced at his father sleeping on the bed, then went to the nurse station to visit his girlfriend.
0:10:33|0:10:41|At that moment, Zhou Kai's girlfriend spoke up.
0:10:41|0:10:47|[Zhou Chao] took the almost dropped medicine bottle and turned around to put it back in place.
0:11:1|0:11:11|On the other side, [Zhou Kai] and [Ma Ke] are out at sea, where the water is calm and the view is clear. A cargo ship filled with goods is sailing by, and occasionally a seagull or two flies overhead.
0:12:6|0:12:9|At this moment, Mr. Pingjing suddenly appears.
0:13:3|0:13:14|[Ma Ke] pulled the trigger, aiming the gun at his own forehead, but was stopped by [Zhou Kai] stepping forward.
0:13:14|0:13:18|[Zhou Kai] returned the gun to Pijing and left dutifully, with [Ma Ke] following closely behind.
0:13:21|0:13:27|On the sea surface of Jingdao City, the maritime police are patrolling, while [Zhou Chao] and his colleague are standing on the shore watching their figures from behind.
0:13:27|0:13:30|At this moment, [Zhou Chao] said.
0:13:30|0:13:34|At the same time, Zhou Kai and others are guiding the small boat to approach the cruise ship on the sea.
0:13:34|0:13:41|After the small boat was moored, the workers immediately opened the hatch and started to move the packaged goods onto the boat one by one.
0:13:41|0:13:50|At this moment, [Zhou Kai] stood at the side of the boat surveying the surroundings, while [Ma Ke], after tidying up his clothes, looked confidently at [Zhou Kai], and finally the two of them looked towards the small boat together.
0:13:51|0:14:7|On the other side, as the coast guard's boat was gradually approaching the cruise ship, unknowingly, Zhou Kai was methodically moving the goods, while the small boat next to the cruise ship was rapidly filling up its cabin at a visible speed.
0:14:7|0:14:12|After the cargo in the cabin was covered, [Zhou Kai] and [Ma Ke] climbed down the ladder of the ship and bid farewell to the sailors before departing.
0:14:14|0:14:16|Over here, [Zhou Chao] and his colleagues are still waiting on the shore.
0:14:53|0:14:57|At this moment on the sea, [Zhou Kai] and [Ma Ke] are guiding the yacht to approach the small boat.
0:14:57|0:15:1|The yacht was seen speeding across the sea and then came to a stop.
0:15:1|0:15:5|The people on the small boat were busy transferring the goods onto the yacht one by one.
0:15:5|0:15:9|On the vast sea surface, only the busy figures of the characters were seen moving cargo.
0:15:9|0:15:12|At this moment, [Ma Ke] looked back and suddenly spoke.
0:15:12|0:15:12|[Zhou Kai] turned around and saw the coast guard fleet.
0:15:23|0:15:28|On the boat, [Zhou Kai] bids farewell to the workers, and then the workers drive away in a small boat.
0:15:28|0:15:40|[Zhou Kai] and [Ma Ke] each drove their yachts quickly away, smiling at each other on the sea. Behind the yachts was the relentless pursuit of the ocean view.
0:15:40|0:15:44|The two of them were speeding on a yacht on the sea, creating layers of splashing waves.
0:15:53|0:15:58|Before long, the small boat unloaded by Zhou Kai and Zhou Chao was caught up by the police, and all the people on board were arrested.
0:15:58|0:16:2|[Zhou Kai] looked back to check the situation and nodded to [Ma Ke].
0:16:2|0:16:10|[Ma Ke] immediately understood, only to see a raging fire erupting at the back of his yacht.
0:16:10|0:16:18|He then quickly found the direction where [Zhou Kai] was, and when [Zhou Kai] noticed, he immediately turned the yacht towards [Ma Ke], while the maritime police were observing the two from behind.
0:16:21|0:16:27|At the moment when the two yachts approached each other, [Ma Ke] leaped down and landed on [Zhou Kai]'s yacht.
0:16:27|0:16:31|Then, the two of them high-fived to celebrate and drove away on a yacht.
0:16:31|0:16:43|The coast guard behind looked at the two men in confusion, while [Ma Ke] smirked smugly.
0:16:43|0:16:47|As the sky darkened, [Zhou Kai] and [Zhou Chao] arrived at the shore of Qin Island in a yacht.
0:17:1|0:17:8|The two of them walked down from the yacht with backpacks, approaching a sewer entrance by the shore. [Zhou Kai] led the way with a flashlight, followed by [Ma Ke].
0:17:35|0:17:39|[Zhou Kai] and [Zhou Chao] touch hands and then leave.
0:17:39|0:17:48|In a flash, [Ma Ke] walked up to a ladder, holding a flashlight in his mouth. He took off his jacket, pulled out another piece of clothing from his bag, put it on, and then climbed up the ladder with his backpack.
0:17:50|0:17:58|Upon reaching the top, [Zhou Kai] pushed open the manhole cover with his hand, looked around, and then climbed out of the sewer.
0:17:58|0:18:2|Restoring the manhole cover, then stepping over the bench, he strides towards the nearby restaurant.
0:18:11|0:18:22|On the other side, near the trash can, just as someone finished dumping the garbage, [Zhou Kai] cautiously pushed open the manhole cover, looked around, and climbed out from it. Beside him was a lively array of bowls and decorations.
0:18:22|0:18:30|He crossed the street and walked into the alley next to the street, looking back from time to time, and soon arrived at the entrance of his own building.
0:18:30|0:18:36|[Zhou Kai] glanced back to make sure no one was following before confidently walking towards the stairs.
0:18:36|0:18:40|He quickly walked up the stairs, still observing the surroundings.
0:18:42|0:18:57|But as soon as he reached the second floor corridor, a figure suddenly appeared from the side staircase and inexplicably pinned him against the wall.
0:18:57|0:19:5|He released the bag full of luggage, his hands pressed against the wall, unable to move for a moment, so he had to let this person check him back and forth.
0:19:5|0:19:6|This person becomes more and more reckless.
0:19:10|0:19:12|[Zhou Kai] took advantage of the man's unpreparedness and turned around to grab him.
0:19:58|0:20:1|In the other side of the restaurant, [Ma Ke] is explaining the situation to [Brother Ha].
0:20:11|0:20:16|[Ma Ke] sat at the bar drinking, when suddenly, the voice of the resident singer Yang Yang came from the stage.
0:22:9|0:22:14|Mr. Zhou looked at [Zhou Chao] in front of him, and [Zhou Chao] then held his father's hand.
0:22:36|0:22:44|Lu Lu suddenly walked into the ward.
0:22:44|0:22:47|[Zhou Chao] looked at [Zhou Kai] awkwardly, and [Zhou Kai] suddenly smiled.
0:23:11|0:23:16|In the hospital room, [Zhou Kai] suddenly turns off the TV.
0:23:16|0:23:17|In another scene, at the police station.
0:23:39|0:23:44|At the same time, [Zhou Kai] hopped and skipped to the seaside harbor, heading towards the brightly lit yacht.
0:24:1|0:24:11|[Zhou Kai] carries Meiling into the boat, with people corresponding.
0:24:11|0:24:14|Mei Ling took off her jacket while talking, and at this moment, the phone rang.
0:24:15|0:24:25|After hanging up the phone, he looked at [Zhou Kai], who then spoke.
0:24:31|0:24:38|[Zhou Kai] looked at Meiling in his arms, couldn't help but lower his head and kissed her neck, and then the two fell onto the bed.
0:24:38|0:24:41|On the other side, in the hotel, [Ma Ke] and Yang Yang are lying on the bed.
0:24:58|0:25:3|[Ma Ke] lifted his head close to Yang Yang, looking into his eyes and said.
0:25:3|0:25:10|Yang Yang then sat up and poured the red wine in his hand onto the tattoo on Ma Ke's back, who was sleeping on Zhou Kai's legs.
0:25:11|0:25:22|The next day at the restaurant, [Zhou Kai] pushed open the private room door, where [Brother Ha] and [Rubber Band] were already seated. Outside the door stood [Brother Ha]'s entourage.
0:26:9|0:26:15|At this moment, [Ma Ke] suddenly saw [A Cang] staring at Meiling and spoke up to remind him.
0:26:15|0:26:16|[A Cang] heard the sound and turned his gaze back.
0:26:48|0:26:50|The crowd raised their glasses and [Zhou Chao] suddenly spoke.
0:27:25|0:27:27|Zhou Kai glanced at [Rubber Band] and turned to [Brother Ha].
0:28:28|0:28:31|After Brother Ha finished speaking, he raised his wine glass and drank it all in one gulp.
0:28:31|0:28:51|The crowd looked at [Zhou Kai] at this moment, and [Zhou Kai] remained silent with his head down, then he reluctantly took out a USB drive.
0:28:51|0:28:55|[Zhou Kai] finished speaking, and everyone fell silent. [A Cang] looked at [Brother Ha] in confusion.
0:29:0|0:29:6|[Rubber Band] smiled and was about to pick up the USB drive in the wine glass, but was snatched away by [Ma Ke].
0:29:19|0:29:22|The intruding follower immediately went out and closed the door upon hearing this.
0:29:22|0:29:24|Ma Ke and [Rubber Band] are still fiercely fighting.
0:29:33|0:29:40|At this moment, [Zhou Kai] suddenly stood up, took out a USB drive, broke it in half, and then threw it into a glass.
0:29:40|0:29:53|After dinner, the group walked out of the private room, with [Brother Ha] and [Zhou Kai] walking side by side.
0:29:53|0:29:54|Brother Ha leans in close to Zhou Kai's ear.
0:30:4|0:30:7|After speaking, [Zhou Kai] left under the gaze of [Brother Ha].
0:30:7|0:30:13|After leaving the restaurant, he drove away with [Ma Ke], who was lying in the passenger seat.
0:30:50|0:31:13|The setting sun, with two or three seagulls flying over the sea. Inside the police station, Zhou Chao and others are having a meeting.
0:31:13|0:31:16|Captain Guo kept urging [Zhou Chao].
0:31:16|0:31:17|Here, [Zhou Kai] walks into the restaurant.
0:31:20|0:31:33|The two walked towards their seats under the guidance of the waiter, [Zhou Kai] looked around, then they walked to their seats, the other two stood up in front of them, shook hands, and sat down.
0:31:49|0:31:57|At the same time, [Ma Ke] stopped a taxi next to the Old Horse Bar, got out of the car, walked up the stairs, and pushed the door open.
0:31:57|0:32:0|In the bar, everyone was having a good time, with [Ma Ke] wearing a smile on his face.
0:32:11|0:32:16|He sat at the bar and asked the person next to him, who then pointed to a photo on the bar.
0:32:16|0:32:29|[Ma Ke] turned around and saw a photo of [Zhou Kai] carving a fire dragon on the bar. He took out a lollipop from his pocket and put it in his mouth.
0:32:29|0:32:30|At this moment, his phone suddenly rang.
0:32:32|0:32:34|In another restaurant, Zhou Kai, Zhou Chao, Ma Ke, A Cang, Brother Ha, and Rubber Band were sitting around a table.
0:32:43|0:32:52|At this moment, the performance on stage is reaching its climax. [Zhou Kai] takes the opportunity to move the box from the ground to the table and asks the other party if they can inspect the goods.
0:32:52|0:32:57|Unexpectedly, he was stopped by the other party, but he still insisted on the need to inspect the goods.
0:33:2|0:33:4|After speaking, he turned and left.
0:33:4|0:33:15|At this moment, the phone of [Zhou Kai] suddenly rang.
0:33:15|0:33:20|At this moment, [A Cang] came out from the back door and saw a police car parked on the side.
0:33:20|0:33:21|He slowly retreated towards the back door.
0:33:25|0:33:27|[Ma Ke] takes a taxi to the restaurant randomly.
0:33:27|0:33:30|And at this moment, [Zhou Chao] and Guo Dui also walked into the restaurant.
0:33:30|0:33:34|[Zhou Kai] hung up the phone, and the two people on the other side immediately took back the box.
0:33:37|0:33:52|But the two on the opposite side stood up, [Zhou Kai] reluctantly agreed, and the three of them prepared to leave together. However, as soon as [Zhou Kai] turned around and took a few steps, the other side pointed a gun at his lower back. He pretended to walk away as if nothing had happened.
0:33:52|0:34:1|At this moment, the crowd in the store is cheering for the performance on stage. [Zhou Kai] takes advantage of the chaos, knocks the gun out of the person behind him, pushes him down, and then rushes to the bar in a panic.
0:34:1|0:34:3|At this moment, [Zhou Chao] and others thought they had been discovered.
0:34:5|0:34:11|The person who was pushed down immediately picked up the gun and shot at [Zhou Kai], who quickly jumped off the bar and dared not move.
0:34:11|0:34:18|The scene was chaotic, with Guo's team ambushing and shooting the armed men, while [Zhou Kai] took the opportunity to escape.
0:34:18|0:34:23|[Zhou Kai] sneaked out from the back door and saw [A Cang] hiding on the side, signaling him to follow.
0:34:23|0:34:31|At this moment, [Zhou Chao] also walked out of the back door, while [Zhou Kai] and [Zhou Chao] hurriedly opened the manhole cover by the roadside and went down the ladder. [Zhou Chao] followed with a gun.
0:34:32|0:34:40|He climbed down the ladder, walked out of an iron gate, carefully observed the surroundings, only to see water flowing everywhere and an endless tunnel.
0:34:40|0:34:47|And then some voices faintly came through, causing him to forget about everything.
0:34:47|0:34:50|On the other side, [Zhou Kai] and [A Cang] are near a ladder.
0:35:2|0:35:11|The two of them paused, stopped their actions, and stayed in place.
0:35:11|0:35:14|With a gunshot, the two hurriedly fled in the opposite direction.
0:35:21|0:35:23|[Zhou Chao] also caught up with the two of them.
0:35:23|0:35:30|[Zhou Kai] was helping [A Cang] up when he was unfortunately shot by [Zhou Chao]. However, the two immediately got up and fled, hiding in a secluded spot in panic.
0:35:30|0:35:43|[Zhou Chao] immediately gave chase, catching up to a iron gate where he looked inside but saw no one, then continued to pursue forward.
0:36:39|0:36:44|At this moment, [Zhou Chao] has caught up with [Zhou Kai].
0:36:44|0:36:48|He stood behind [Zhou Kai] with a gun in his hand, checking if there was anyone behind.
0:36:48|0:36:49|[Zhou Kai] slowly raised one hand.
0:36:54|0:37:3|[Zhou Chao] slowly approaches [Zhou Kai].
0:37:3|0:37:7|In the taxi, [Ma Ke] looks serious.
0:37:7|0:37:11|Then, [Zhou Kai] dropped the phone and slowly raised his other hand before stopping in place.
0:37:11|0:37:14|[Zhou Chao] cautiously approaches him with a gun.
0:37:14|0:37:18|[Zhou Kai] suddenly fell to the ground, and at that moment, the sound of police cars could be heard around him.
0:37:18|0:37:22|In the taxi at this moment, after [Ma Ke] hung up the phone, the driver spoke.
0:37:25|0:37:28|[Ma Ke] glanced at the driver, then opened the door and got out of the car.
0:37:51|0:38:3|On the other side, [Zhou Chao] walked up to [Zhou Kai] and took out handcuffs. At this moment, [Zhou Kai], who was lying on the ground, suddenly turned around. [Zhou Chao] looked at his brother on the ground, with an incredulous expression on his face. [Zhou Kai] looked up at his younger brother.
0:38:3|0:38:9|After exchanging a glance, [Zhou Chao] stood still, with a stiff expression, and slowly lowered the gun in his hand.
0:38:9|0:38:19|At this moment, [Zhou Kai] was lying on the ground exhausted, while other police officers had arrived. They ran towards [Zhou Kai], took the handcuffs from [Zhou Chao], put them on [Zhou Kai]'s hands, and helped him up.
0:38:20|0:38:24|[Zhou Kai] stood up and looked at the expressionless [Zhou Chao].
0:38:28|0:38:32|The others left, leaving only [Zhou Chao] standing still in place.
0:38:32|0:38:37|Meanwhile, [Ma Ke] ran frantically along the shore, his destination unknown.
0:38:37|0:38:41|Before long, he gradually slowed down his pace and stopped, panting heavily.
0:38:41|0:38:46|The scene shifts to the hospital, where [Zhou Kai] is lying on the hospital bed with the police standing beside him.
0:38:53|0:39:10|[Zhou Chao] stood outside the ward with a blank expression, [Zhou Kai] lay silently inside, while in Brother Ha's car, his men were rummaging through Zhou Kai's boat. The woman in the car, Meiling, spoke up.
0:39:21|0:39:25|Mei Ling was about to get off the car, but was pushed back in by someone.
0:39:25|0:39:27|In the car, [A Cang] took out a syringe at this moment.
0:39:40|0:39:48|[Zhou Chao] bid farewell to his colleagues at the hospital, while someone with a flashlight entered his home, the visitor turned out to be one of [Brother Ha]'s henchmen.
0:39:48|0:39:58|After entering the room and closing the door behind him, [Zhou Kai] looked around and then carefully walked towards the cabinet in the living room. He opened the drawer and used the flashlight to search around.
0:39:58|0:40:2|Meanwhile, [Zhou Kai], who was sleeping in the room, was awakened and came out to see what was happening.
0:40:11|0:40:18|[Zhou Chao] picked up the floor lamp and smashed it towards the villain, but [Zhou Chao] had just arrived downstairs at this moment.
0:40:18|0:40:25|Immediately, he ran off, while [Zhou Kai] failed to stop the thug from being caught by the collar.
0:40:25|0:40:28|The thug pulled out a dagger and stabbed at [Zhou Kai], while [Zhou Chao] rushed to the house.
0:40:30|0:40:46|[Zhou Chao] immediately bent down to check on his father, while the thug still tried to approach. He quickly stood up, pushed the thug to the cabinet, hit his head with his elbow, and then held the thug to prevent him from moving. The thug tried to lift [Zhou Chao] with both hands, but [Zhou Chao] tightly gripped his neck with his arm.
0:40:50|0:41:9|Then, leveraging his strength, he fiercely kicked the head of the thug with his knee, causing both of them to crash through the glass door and fall to the ground. Seizing the opportunity, the thug pinned [Zhou Chao] down, choking him. Unable to resist for a moment, [Zhou Chao] intended to pick up a nearby wooden stick, but the thug controlled his arm and directed it towards himself, watching as the stick got closer and closer.
0:41:10|0:41:17|At a critical moment, [Zhou Kai] suddenly picked up a piece of wood from the ground, stabbed it into the back of the villain, and then fell to the side.
0:41:17|0:41:28|The thug fell to the ground at this moment, and [Zhou Chao] quickly got up and looked at [Zhou Kai].
0:41:28|0:41:37|[Zhou Kai], who is seriously injured, is about to pass out. [Zhou Chao] takes him to the hospital, then sits in the corridor crying in pain, while [Ma Ke] and others have also arrived at the hospital.
0:41:39|0:41:51|The scene shifts to Japan three days later, the night sea is very quiet, only [Ma Ke] with a backpack walking on the bustling street, he arrives at the previous restaurant to meet his Taiwanese compatriot.
0:41:51|0:41:56|The store is very lively, with the two sitting in the private room. After [Ma Ke] finishes packing, he takes the bag and leaves.
0:41:58|0:42:3|He drove the yacht alone on the dark sea surface, and then arrived at the small town.
0:42:3|0:42:7|The night streets of Japan were bustling with people coming and going.
0:42:7|0:42:19|[Ma Ke] got off the boat and walked on the street. He looked around, took off his backpack, took out something from it and put it into his pocket. Then he casually threw the backpack away and continued walking forward.
0:42:19|0:42:21|His expression was resolute and determined.
0:42:24|0:42:31|He dodged the crowd on the street corner for the longest time, then walked steadily towards the restaurant in front of him.
0:42:31|0:42:34|[Ma Ke] smiled and walked into the restaurant.
0:42:34|0:42:38|The shop assistant at the door bowed to welcome them.
0:42:38|0:42:40|Ma Ke then walked through the shop door and into the path in the bamboo forest.
0:42:42|0:42:51|Then they arrived under a beautiful loft, surrounded by fake trees, giving people a very comfortable feeling.
0:42:51|0:42:55|[Ma Ke] looked up and saw the dancing girls on the attic.
0:42:55|0:43:0|At this moment, a shop assistant walked towards them, while [Ma Ke] stepped aside to let him pass first.
0:43:0|0:43:2|The clerk bowed to [Ma Ke] and then left with a tray.
0:43:3|0:43:9|After the clerk left, [Ma Ke] looked up at the attic and saw [Rubber Band] and [Steel Village] eating there.
0:43:9|0:43:17|Later, [Ma Ke] imitated the dance moves of the female dancer on the loft, swaying his arms back and forth while slowly moving forward.
0:43:17|0:43:27|He then squatted down and hid a handgun in the gap between the attic and the ground, before continuing to walk and jump, reaching the street lamp to place the second handgun.
0:43:27|0:43:31|At this moment, [Rubber Band] upstairs is drinking and having fun, completely unaware of the impending danger.
0:43:34|0:43:39|Ma Ke was about to go upstairs when he saw a girl in a plaid skirt next to the stairs.
0:43:39|0:43:47|The little girl looked at Ma Ke with a puzzled expression, while behind her stood a tall girl in the same clothes, leaning against the door of the compartment.
0:43:49|0:43:58|Not understanding the situation, Ma Ke walked to the side of the stairs and gestured for the two girls to come over. He then took out two lollipops and handed them to the girls with a smile.
0:43:58|0:44:4|The tall girl nodded at the other girl, and they accepted lollipops as a gesture of thanks.
0:44:4|0:44:9|Ma Ke gestured for the two to leave, then put his index finger to his mouth and made a shushing sound.
0:44:11|0:44:16|He then walked up the stairs solemnly and pulled out a gun.
0:44:19|0:44:25|Ma Ke pushed him down the stairs and then turned to open the compartment door, aiming at [Rubber Band], and fired several shots in succession.
0:44:25|0:44:29|Approaching again, pointing the rifle at [Rubber Band]'s forehead, then firing another shot.
0:44:29|0:44:34|Xue saw his face, but he showed no fear at all. His brow furrowed fiercely, looking very menacing.
0:44:37|0:44:45|Seeing [Rubber Band] fall down, he breathed a sigh of relief. The gunshot scared away the dancers next to him, and Ma Ke also turned around to leave.
0:44:45|0:44:51|At this moment, [Zhou Kai] suddenly pulled out a gun and aimed it at him, while the attendant beside him also nervously prepared to stand up.
0:44:57|0:45:16|During the confrontation, the ground unexpectedly started shaking, causing the customers in the shop to scatter. [Ma Ke] almost fell to the ground, and a servant nearby lifted a table and smashed it towards [Ma Ke]. [Ma Ke] immediately dodged and moved to another place, but the servant then picked up [Ma Ke] and threw him to the ground, before overpowering him and repeatedly hitting him on the head.
0:45:16|0:45:18|Gangcun saw the situation and walked outside.
0:45:19|0:45:29|[Ma Ke] continuously strikes the opponent's arms, then sits up and shoots at the incoming reinforcements. He then injures the leg of a person nearby, but is suddenly grabbed by another person.
0:45:29|0:45:34|He then injured his leg, and the man hurriedly retreated.
0:45:34|0:45:40|At this moment, suddenly a person bursts in, [Ma Ke] hurriedly injuring his ankle, and another person is seen preparing to get up.
0:45:40|0:45:46|He quickly picked up the gun on the ground and shot at him, then got up and walked out, but was forced back by the gunfire downstairs.
0:45:47|0:45:54|Inside the house, [Ma Ke] injured the person inside, then backed up against the stairs and slid down, firing shots towards the upper floor one after another.
0:45:54|0:46:0|After going downstairs, he picked up the hidden pistol and shot the others in the legs before turning around and leaving.
0:46:0|0:46:5|At this moment, [Zhou Kai] suddenly emerged from the house, aimed a gun at [Ma Ke], and then shot him in the leg.
0:46:6|0:46:19|Ma Ke fell to the ground and crawled towards the attic, reaching for the handgun he had hidden before. However, Zhou Chao fired again, hitting the ground beside Ma Ke. He then glanced at Ma Ke, who was frozen in place, and walked away.
0:46:19|0:46:30|Ma Ke walked down the street with a limp, his face covered in blood, causing passersby to look at him in fear. However, he paid no attention to their stares and continued on until he reached the shore. He then drove a yacht away from the scene alone.
0:46:35|0:46:41|On the other side, [Zhou Chao] stood by the window, holding a childhood photo of Yu Zhou Kai, lost in thought.
0:46:41|0:46:45|He glanced at the photo, then turned around silently and smashed the photo fiercely on the ground.
0:46:47|0:46:56|Three months later, the sea surface of Qin Island City remained calm as usual, with occasional two or three seagulls flying by.
0:46:56|0:47:3|On the other side of the cell, [Zhou Kai] stood silently by the window, looking outside with a vacant expression.
0:47:3|0:47:12|At this moment, the photographer finished washing up and returned to the dormitory to tidy up the bed. [Zhou Kai] also slowly returned to the bedside and sat down, the four walls of the cell completely isolating him from the outside world.
0:47:14|0:47:20|On the other side of the shore, Ma Ke slowly stopped and leaned on his cane, looking into the distance.
0:47:20|0:47:24|And his left leg was wrapped in gauze, the wounds on his face had not yet healed.
0:47:24|0:47:33|The sea breeze scattered his messy hair as he simply turned his head away.
0:47:33|0:47:39|Meanwhile, in the police station, [Zhou Chao] is practicing shooting in the shooting range, and then he goes to the training ground to practice combat with his colleagues.
0:47:41|0:47:44|[Zhou Chao] swung his fist at his teammate, only to be thrown to the ground by him.
0:47:44|0:47:48|He then stood up and continued to punch the sandbag with his fists.
0:47:48|0:47:50|After returning home in the evening, he went straight to bed and fell asleep.
0:47:50|0:47:55|Lulu, who has become his wife, patiently bandages his waist.
0:47:55|0:47:58|The next day, in the prison cell, someone walked up to [Zhou Kai] who was folding paper bags.
0:48:8|0:48:13|Yu Jing interrupted the man, [Zhou Kai] just stood there, not saying a word.
0:48:13|0:48:18|On the other side, Zhou Chao took a taxi to a tavern where Ma Ke was having a meal.
0:48:18|0:48:23|He sat down across from [Ma Ke], who looked up at him.
0:48:36|0:48:42|The waiter brought the dishes to the table, and [Zhou Chao] then spoke.
0:48:42|0:48:56|Ma Ke just kept eating without saying a word, while [Zhou Chao] continued speaking.
0:48:56|0:49:0|Ma Ke looked up at [Zhou Chao] and spoke after finishing his meal.
0:49:1|0:49:6|[Zhou Chao] listened without responding, then looked away, while Ma Ke continued eating.
0:49:17|0:49:21|Ma Ke chuckled and looked at [Zhou Chao].
0:49:29|0:49:36|After he finished speaking, he got up and left. The scene suddenly switched to the prison cell, where [Zhou Kai] was looking outside through the bars.
0:49:36|0:49:43|At this moment, in the police training room, [Zhou Chao] knocks down his teammate on the ground.
0:49:43|0:49:48|On the other hand, [Zhou Kai] either sat in the dormitory or sat silently on the playground.
0:49:48|0:49:55|Suddenly, half a year later, four or five cars appeared on the streets of Qindao City, chasing each other, causing pedestrians to dodge.
0:49:59|0:50:11|[Zhou Chao] pulls the criminal out of the car at gunpoint.
0:50:11|0:50:15|[Zhou Kai] watches the TV report in the dormitory.
0:50:15|0:50:19|On the other side, by the coast, Zhou Chao is arresting a suspect.
0:50:19|0:50:25|With Zhou Chao's outstanding performance at work, the police station awarded him a badge as an encouragement.
0:50:25|0:50:51|The scene then shifts to Zhou Chao's home, where he is celebrating his birthday with Lu Lu. After he blows out the candles, Lu Lu presents him with a gift box.
0:50:51|0:50:56|On the other side, in the prison yard, [Zhou Kai] sat and watched as someone sang nearby.
0:51:25|0:51:28|He looked at [Zhou Kai], then turned around and prepared to get up and leave.
0:51:34|0:51:55|After the man finished speaking, three years later, [Zhou Kai] walked out of the prison gate carrying luggage and a backpack. Just a few steps out, he saw someone setting off firecrackers across the street, and someone leaping into the arms of the newly released person behind him. A taxi waiting on the side of the road quickly picked up the person and drove away.
0:51:55|0:51:58|[Zhou Kai] stood still, looking around in confusion.
0:52:7|0:52:27|[Zhou Kai] ignored Rack's voice, turned and walked away. [Zhou Chao] drove and stopped beside him shortly after. [Zhou Kai] stopped and turned to look into the car, but [Zhou Chao] didn't look at him. Then [Zhou Kai] got in the car, and the two drove along the seaside road. Suddenly, [Zhou Kai] broke the silence.
0:52:43|0:52:48|[Zhou Chao] suddenly slammed on the brakes, got out of the car, and strode aggressively towards the passenger seat.
0:52:48|0:52:55|Opening the car door, [Zhou Kai] looked at him silently, then suddenly spoke.
0:52:55|0:52:58|[Zhou Kai] was stunned for a few seconds after hearing this, then he unbuckled his seatbelt and prepared to get off the car.
0:53:16|0:53:17|He knocked [Zhou Kai] down to the ground.
0:53:32|0:53:45|He then picked up [Zhou Kai]'s luggage on the roadside and smashed it fiercely towards [Zhou Kai].
0:53:45|0:53:49|After speaking, he viciously kicked [Zhou Kai] and then walked away angrily.
0:53:49|0:53:55|Driving away in the car, leaving [Zhou Kai] alone here.
0:53:55|0:53:59|[Zhou Kai] is still lying on the ground in pain, unable to recover for a long time.
0:54:1|0:54:8|He slowly stood up after a while.
0:54:8|0:54:13|And over here, [Zhou Chao] had already driven home, sitting on the sofa with a vacant look in his eyes.
0:54:13|0:54:22|Suddenly, Lulu pushed the door open.
0:54:22|0:54:25|Lulu put down the bag and picked up the water bottle, while [Zhou Chao] remained silent.
0:54:28|0:54:31|Lulu put down the water bottle and walked up to [Zhou Chao], looking at his hand.
0:54:31|0:54:39|[Zhou Chao] just realized.
0:54:39|0:54:42|Lulu took out the medicine and gave it to [Zhou Chao].
0:54:42|0:54:45|At this moment, a knocking sound is suddenly heard, and Lulu goes to open the door.
0:54:45|0:54:48|Just opened the door and saw [Zhou Kai] standing outside.
0:54:48|0:54:52|[Zhou Chao] suddenly ran over to close the door in the room, while [Zhou Kai] used his hand to hold the door.
0:54:56|0:55:3|After speaking, he prepared to close the door, but [Zhou Kai] still refused to let go.
0:55:3|0:55:7|Lulu immediately pulled [Zhou Chao] aside.
0:55:7|0:55:15|[Zhou Kai] pushed the door open, rubbed his shoes on the doormat, closed the door, and then placed his luggage next to the shoe cabinet.
0:55:15|0:55:19|[Zhou Chao] stared at [Zhou Kai].
0:55:19|0:55:21|At this moment, Lulu walked over and handed a glass of water to [Zhou Kai].
0:55:27|0:55:33|He took the water and placed it aside without drinking, then quietly walked towards his father's portrait.
0:55:33|0:55:36|[Zhou Chao] sat on the sofa in silence.
0:55:36|0:55:50|[Zhou Kai] walked up to the memorial tablet, took a step back, knelt down, and knocked his head a few times while looking at his father's photo.
0:55:50|0:55:55|The room was very quiet for a moment, with none of the three speaking, only the sound of [Zhou Kai] knocking his head.
0:55:58|0:56:9|Afterwards, [Zhou Kai] stopped moving, stood up slowly with red eyes, took a step forward, and spoke while looking at his father's photo.
0:56:9|0:56:16|[Zhou Chao] listened and recalled the previous scene.
0:56:33|0:56:46|[Zhou Chao] finished speaking, lowered his head and covered his eyes with his hand, while [Zhou Kai] remained silent, looking at the photo on the table by the wall. He then walked to the shoe cabinet, picked up his luggage, and [Zhou Chao] watched him stand up and said.
0:56:55|0:57:16|Shortly after, [Zhou Kai] pushed the door open and left. As the sky darkened, he walked alone on the street.
0:57:16|0:57:21|Watching his brothers playing on the street, [Zhou Chao] stopped and then found a bathhouse to take a bath.
0:57:31|0:57:36|He was taking a shower and recalling the words of the prisoners in the prison.
0:57:47|0:57:57|[Zhou Kai] asked and then walked towards the ship. He looked around on the ship, but there was no one in sight, only scattered items piled up everywhere.
0:57:57|0:58:0|He looked around and suddenly heard someone singing.
0:58:19|0:58:23|[Ma Ke] slowly walked up the stairs, turned around when he heard singing, and saw [Zhou Kai].
0:58:23|0:58:28|Immediately putting down the broom, [Zhou Kai] quickly walked towards.
0:58:28|0:58:31|The two embraced each other excitedly, with [Ma Ke] shedding tears of joy.
0:58:31|0:58:38|After a while, they let go of each other and then he spoke.
0:58:38|0:58:40|Ma Ke suddenly pointed at the wound on Zhou Kai's face.
0:59:9|0:59:12|After speaking, he raised his right hand, and [Zhou Kai] reached out to hold it.
0:59:16|0:59:29|[Zhou Kai] pulled out his hand, looked at the sea, and then spoke.
0:59:29|0:59:35|[Ma Ke] turned around randomly, picked up a broom to sweep the floor, and then spoke.
0:59:35|0:59:38|Picking up the nearby rag, he turned around to wipe the plastic bucket.
0:59:41|0:59:45|Then [Zhou Kai] walked in, threw away the rag, and asked.
0:59:45|0:59:52|[Zhou Kai] nodded as he looked at him. Without saying a word in response to [Ma Ke]'s questioning, [Ma Ke] continued speaking.
1:0:26|1:0:32|Shortly after, [Ma Ke] turned and left, with [Zhou Kai] following him in silence.
1:0:41|1:0:47|At this moment, [A Cang] suddenly appears with his men.
1:0:47|1:0:50|[Ma Ke] stood aggressively in front of [A Cang].
1:0:53|1:0:56|[A Cang] stepped aside to clear the way, looking at [Ma Ke].
1:0:56|1:0:58|[Ma Ke] had just taken a few steps when he was pushed into the sea by his subordinates.
1:1:10|1:1:23|[Zhou Kai] grabbed [A Cang] by the collar and questioned him, while [Ma Ke] also swam to the shore.
1:1:23|1:1:28|[Zhou Kai] finally loosened [A Cang]'s collar.
1:1:28|1:1:32|[A Cang] turned and walked away, while [Zhou Kai] intended to help [Ma Ke] up on the shore.
1:1:44|1:1:55|[Zhou Kai] left and arrived at another port. The busy port in the early morning was filled with yachts scattered everywhere, and the sound of yacht horns could be faintly heard in the distance.
1:1:55|1:2:0|On the sea surface, a few seagulls fly by, as [Zhou Kai] looks down at the harbor in front of him and walks slowly.
1:2:4|1:2:7|Before long, she found her own boat.
1:2:7|1:2:15|She then jumped onto the boat, opened the hatch, and saw a messy and dirty table.
1:2:15|1:2:26|Soon, [Mei Ling] stumbled out in a daze.
1:2:41|1:2:50|[Mei Ling] squatted next to the table, reaching for the bottle on the table. [Zhou Kai] quickly grabbed the bottle and threw it on the ground.
1:2:50|1:3:0|The two fell silent for a moment, when suddenly [Mei Ling]'s phone rang.
1:3:0|1:3:4|After hanging up the phone, Meiling stood still as [Zhou Kai] casually dropped his bag.
1:3:9|1:3:13|Mei Ling then stood up and walked numbly towards the edge of the bed.
1:3:22|1:3:29|[Zhou Kai] buried his head in Meiling's shoulder, rubbing against her neck without saying a word.
1:3:29|1:3:33|After a while, Meiling numbly pushed away the hands of [Zhou Kai] hugging her.
1:3:35|1:3:48|The scene cuts to the shore, where [Zhou Kai] is sitting and fishing. Two ducks swim by on the water, and he lifts his fishing rod but there is no fish on the hook. He then throws the hook back into the water.
1:3:48|1:3:57|After a while, a small fish was caught on the hook, [Zhou Kai] looked at the fish on the hook thoughtfully, and then he found [Brother Ha].
1:4:19|1:4:28|After meeting Brother Ha, Zhou Kai was busy washing the car by the shore. He poured a bucket of water on the car and then picked up a cloth to wipe the body of the car.
1:4:28|1:4:40|The next morning, the scene shifts to the bustling seafood market, where crowds of people are busy selecting goods. [Zhou Kai] drives slowly to the market and parks his car before walking into the crowd.
1:4:41|1:4:49|The crowded people around jostled him back and forth, but he didn't mind at all, just looking around to pick out goods.
1:4:49|1:4:54|Later, he walked up to a stall and squatted down, while [Zhou Chao] secretly watched him from the side.
1:4:59|1:5:3|[Zhou Kai] puts the seafood into the car and then drives to the entrance of the restaurant.
1:5:3|1:5:12|At this moment, the waiting chefs unloaded the goods from the car one by one, with [Zhou Kai] also helping to move the goods. All of this was observed by [Zhou Chao] in the car parked by the roadside.
1:5:56|1:6:0|[Zhou Kai] stood up, waved his hand, then drove away, full of resentment.
1:6:0|1:6:2|On the other side, [Ma Ke] sat at the harbor.
1:6:48|1:6:50|[Ma Ke] slowly approached the two of them, looking at the front of Yang Yang.
1:7:0|1:7:4|He intended to leave, but heard the man speak.
1:7:4|1:7:17|He then suddenly turned around and threw a punch at the man, who covered his face and fell to the ground. Zhou Chao looked at Ma Ke's actions in shock, then looked up and down at Ma Ke, staring at the eyes covered by hair in front of him. He said persistently.
1:7:40|1:7:44|[Zhou Kai] arrived at the port at this moment and happened to witness this scene.
1:7:44|1:7:46|[Ma Ke] gradually walked towards him and spoke.
1:8:16|1:8:21|[Zhou Chao] is currently monitoring the situation outside the restaurant, and he sees Meiling getting out of the car with [A Cang].
1:8:25|1:8:30|Subsequently, [A Cang] embraced Meiling and walked into the store, while on the other side, [Zhou Kai] went to the morning market as usual.
1:8:42|1:8:53|The person who suddenly spoke was trapped in a fishing net, only to be knocked down by [Ma Ke] who appeared out of nowhere. He then lifted his leg and pushed another person into the sea, waving the fishing net and shouting loudly.
1:8:53|1:9:2|Zhou Kai then kicked down the person who attacked, causing everyone to fall down. Ma Ke held up the leader with a stick, while Zhou Kai glanced at the person.
1:9:7|1:9:13|[Ma Ke] rested his arm on [Zhou Kai]'s shoulder, the two exchanged a smile and left the place.
1:9:13|1:9:19|The scene shifts to a cruise ship at sea, where [Ma Ke] and [Zhou Kai] are arriving by taxi.
1:9:19|1:9:24|They got off the car and walked up the stairs, only to see a notice of demolition by Old Ma's father at the door.
1:9:24|1:9:27|Shortly after, they pushed the door and entered the shop, with [Ma Ke] speaking first.
1:9:30|1:9:32|The two raised their glasses and drank together.
1:9:46|1:9:57|[Zhou Kai] immediately opened the music box in the shape of a cruise ship in the car, while [Ma Ke] turned around and picked up a vinyl record, placed it in the record player, and then danced along with the music.
1:9:57|1:10:3|[Zhou Kai] sat at the bar, drinking and smiling as he watched [Ma Ke], who was immersed in dancing.
1:10:41|1:10:43|[Ma Ke] stared fiercely at [A Cang].
1:10:45|1:10:51|[Ma Ke] said nothing, pulled a chair and sat down, putting his legs on the table, blocking [A Cang]'s view.
1:10:51|1:11:2|[A Cang] glanced at [Zhou Kai], gesturing to his men that he was fine, then looked at [Ma Ke], casually picked up a bottle of wine, and said.
1:11:2|1:11:7|[Ma Ke] glanced at the wine and smiled, took the bottle, while [A Cang] was about to open it.
1:11:8|1:11:15|[Ma Ke] smashed the bottle onto his injured leg, causing it to shatter on the ground, while [Ma Ke] remained motionless.
1:11:15|1:11:20|[Zhou Kai] walked over slowly, handed [Ma Ke] a glass of wine, and then spoke.
1:11:47|1:11:50|[A Cang] takes off his jacket and sits down.
1:12:32|1:12:46|On the other side, [Zhou Chao] has arrived outside the bar. He parked the car and got out, only to see [A Cang]'s henchmen having fun outside the bar.
1:12:46|1:12:52|[Zhou Chao] glanced at the people around him.
1:12:52|1:12:55|In the bar, [A Cang]'s henchmen whispered in his ear.
1:13:5|1:13:15|At this moment, [Zhou Chao] just walked into the bar, followed by [A Cang] walking out of the bar.
1:13:15|1:13:21|At this moment, [A Cang] walks outside, followed by the two of them walking down the stairs and leaving.
1:13:37|1:13:44|[Zhou Kai] looks away.
1:14:20|1:14:28|The two then walked out of the bar, with [Zhou Kai] turning around.
1:14:28|1:14:31|Outside the bar, [Zhou Chao] was about to leave when he was stopped by [Ma Ke].
1:15:1|1:15:3|The two started fighting, with [Ma Ke] falling to the ground.
1:15:26|1:15:31|[Zhou Kai] finished speaking, walked towards [Ma Ke] and helped him up, while [Zhou Chao] turned and walked down the stairs.
1:15:32|1:15:39|[Zhou Kai] stood outside watching [Zhou Chao] drive away, then turned his head to look into the distance.
1:15:39|1:15:43|[Ma Ke] walked beside [Zhou Kai], looking down without saying a word.
1:15:43|1:15:48|At this moment, [Zhou Chao] angrily roars in the car, then bursts into tears, and drives away.
1:16:39|1:16:49|A seagull flies over the sea at this moment, and the scene suddenly shifts to a restaurant where [Zhou Chao] walks in and looks around. He then takes out his police badge and stops in front of [Mei Ling].
1:16:55|1:17:0|[Mei Ling] looked away without answering, while [Brother Ha] was upstairs watching everything.
1:17:0|1:17:7|On the other side, [Ma Ke] took a taxi to an alley, where he got out of the car, put on a hat, and cautiously walked into the alley.
1:17:7|1:17:14|He cautiously looked around, there were almost no people in the alley, only a few individuals squatting outside a house in the alley.
1:17:14|1:17:16|[Ma Ke] saw a few people and quickly hid behind the wall.
1:18:3|1:18:13|Here, [Zhou Kai] hung up the phone, threw down the mobile phone, slapped the steering wheel in frustration, and then sighed. On the other side, [Ma Ke] had already lurked outside the house where [A Cang] was making drugs.
1:18:13|1:18:16|After looking around, he took out a piece of paper with Zhou Chao's phone number written on it.
1:18:21|1:18:25|Suddenly, a van slowly drove into the alley.
1:18:25|1:18:31|[Ma Ke] carefully observed the situation outside the house, where he saw them continuously moving things from the car into the house.
1:18:31|1:18:41|After the van left, [Ma Ke] quietly pushed open the iron gate and slipped into the courtyard.
1:18:41|1:18:42|He was found as soon as he entered the courtyard.
1:18:52|1:18:55|[Ma Ke] looked towards the warehouse on the second floor, and then was knocked unconscious.
1:19:13|1:19:15|He burst into the office of [Zhou Chao] and others.
1:19:21|1:19:24|Then, [Zhou Chao] walked out of the office.
1:20:9|1:20:15|On the other side, [Ma Ke] is being tied up in the courtyard and beaten by someone.
1:20:15|1:20:18|Then, [A Cang] sat next to him with a stool and spoke.
1:20:34|1:20:37|Ma Ke smiled, but [A Cang] stood up and stepped on his left leg.
1:20:44|1:20:49|Then everyone tied Ma Ke up and continuously beat him until he lay on the ground.
1:20:49|1:20:51|[A Cang] saw all this from upstairs.
1:20:54|1:20:56|At this moment, [Zhou Kai] has just walked out of the police station.
1:21:22|1:21:29|Suddenly, everyone in the courtyard ran towards the upstairs.
1:21:41|1:21:53|Outside at this moment, Guo Dui disguised as a delivery person and others have already taken control of the guards at the entrance, followed by a large number of special police officers entering the alleyway.
1:21:53|1:21:59|Guo's team also entered the courtyard.
1:21:59|1:22:3|At this moment, the special police force slowly entered the courtyard.
1:22:3|1:22:7|Here, [A Cang] finished eating and saw the police around, so the two immediately turned and left.
1:22:10|1:22:17|Some suspects in the house were holding their heads and squatting, while others were jumping down from the second floor.
1:22:17|1:22:23|At this moment, [Zhou Chao] spotted the fleeing [A Cang] and immediately gave chase.
1:22:23|1:22:26|[A Cang] heard it and ran away immediately.
1:22:26|1:22:29|On the other side, the suspects in the courtyard are still stubbornly resisting the special police.
1:22:31|1:22:38|Here, [A Cang]'s henchman is hiding behind an iron gate, while [Ma Ke] suddenly approaches from behind and strikes him on the head.
1:22:38|1:22:46|And over here, [A Cang] is running out of the alley, occasionally looking back, with [Zhou Chao] closely chasing after.
1:22:46|1:22:52|[A Cang] pushed a passerby to the ground with a casual gesture, while [Zhou Chao] quickly helped the passerby up.
1:22:52|1:22:55|On the other side, the special police are still fighting with the suspect upstairs.
1:23:1|1:23:12|At this moment, [A Cang] snatched a car from a passerby.
1:23:12|1:23:22|[Zhou Chao] had to borrow a passerby's car to chase after [A Cang], while at the same time, a special police officer in the courtyard knocked down the suspect on the second floor, allowing other special police officers to enter the room on the second floor.
1:23:22|1:23:27|In the room, the suspect was about to shoot when he was knocked down.
1:23:27|1:23:29|Here, [Zhou Chao] is still chasing after [A Cang].
1:23:33|1:23:50|The two of them were drifting back and forth in the tunnel, with [A Cang] making a sharp turn out of the tunnel.
1:23:55|1:24:14|[Zhou Chao] closely followed behind, and the two arrived near an abandoned port. [A Cang] made a sharp turn towards an abandoned factory, crashing through the factory's iron gate and then breaking through obstacles. Turning out of the factory, the two drove onto the road next to the factory, with the speeding car continuously kicking up dust from the ground.
1:24:14|1:24:16|[Zhou Chao] is now leaving side by side with [A Cang].
1:24:24|1:24:27|Suddenly, [A Cang] picked up a gun and shot at [Zhou Chao].
1:24:27|1:24:32|[Zhou Chao] lowered his head and accidentally bumped into the abandoned pile on the side, forcing him to stop the car.
1:24:32|1:24:37|A Cang then jumps off the car and escapes by the shore.
1:24:37|1:24:40|Then, his car flew into the sea.
1:24:40|1:24:48|[Zhou Chao] immediately got off the car and ran to the shore, only to see [A Cang]'s car gradually sinking into the sea.
1:24:48|1:24:51|Suddenly, he turned around and saw the manhole cover on the shore being moved.
1:26:14|1:26:17|After speaking, [Ma Ke] raised his right hand, and [Zhou Kai] chuckled and gave it a pat.
1:26:22|1:26:25|On the other side, [Zhou Kai] and others arrived at the restaurant to arrest [A Cang].
1:27:22|1:27:28|Then, [Zhou Kai] drove towards the agreed location.
1:27:28|1:27:36|On the other side, [Zhou Kai] and others did not find [A Cang]. At this moment, [Zhou Chao] arrived at the agreed location, he got off the car and stood by the roadside preparing to cross the street.
1:27:36|1:27:41|On the other side, [Zhou Kai] was also about to arrive nearby, when [Ma Ke] suddenly spoke up in the car.
1:27:48|1:27:58|[Zhou Chao] was crossing the road when suddenly, a van came speeding towards him, hitting [Zhou Chao] hard before quickly fleeing the scene. [Zhou Chao] was knocked down to the ground.
1:27:58|1:28:13|At this moment, [Zhou Kai] drove to the intersection. He slowly stopped the car, but suddenly saw [Zhou Chao] lying on the ground. He immediately unbuckled his seatbelt, got out of the car and ran towards [Zhou Chao], promptly taking him to the hospital. Afterwards, he carried [Zhou Chao] on his back to the hospital.
1:28:28|1:28:33|[Zhou Kai] immediately ran towards the emergency room, while [Ma Ke] limped along behind.
1:28:33|1:28:37|At this moment, [Zhou Chao] is lying motionless on [Zhou Kai]'s back.
1:28:37|1:28:45|[Zhou Kai] gritted his teeth and ran quickly towards the emergency room, as if everything around him seemed irrelevant at that moment.
1:28:45|1:28:51|He kept running and standing, his hands supporting [Zhou Chao] so that [Zhou Chao] wouldn't slip off his back.
1:28:53|1:28:57|The nurse beside him, strong, also helped support [Zhou Chao].
1:28:57|1:29:4|Before long, they arrived at the emergency room. [Zhou Chao] was taken into the operating room, while [Zhou Kai] and [Ma Ke] anxiously waited outside.
1:29:33|1:29:36|After Lulu finished speaking, she put on her mask and walked into the operating room.
1:29:45|1:29:52|The scene shifts to the next day on the sea, where besides a few seagulls, there is a ship sailing on the vast sea.
1:29:52|1:29:55|[Zhou Kai] and [Ma Ke] are driving a small boat, gliding continuously.
1:29:58|1:30:8|On the other side, [Zhou Chao] slowly opened his eyes in the ward. He picked up the card left by Lu Lu on the cabinet next to him, and smiled after reading the words left by Lu Lu.
1:30:18|1:30:19|He sat up abruptly from the bed.
1:30:21|1:30:25|And at this moment on the sea, [A Cang] is slowly steering the small boat towards the ship.
1:30:25|1:30:28|He then climbed onto the ship with the help of a rope.
1:30:28|1:30:33|Not long after climbing up, Zhou Kai and Ma Ke suddenly appeared on the ship.
1:30:33|1:30:36|[A Cang] immediately jumped off the boat upon seeing the two of them.
1:30:36|1:30:39|[Zhou Kai] also immediately jumped off the boat and chased after [A Cang].
1:30:39|1:30:43|[A Cang] ran to the stern of the boat and kept picking up things on the boat to throw at [Zhou Kai].
1:30:44|1:31:5|The two immediately started fighting, and [Ma Ke] also came down from the ship at this time, pushing the followers on the ship into the sea.
1:31:5|1:31:8|[Ma Ke] threw a lifebuoy into the sea and then looked at [Zhou Kai].
1:31:18|1:31:25|[Zhou Kai] and [A Cang] are currently fighting in the sea, constantly stirring up bubbles in the water.
1:31:25|1:31:32|[Zhou Kai] in the water kept pushing [A Cang] underwater, while [A Cang] tightly closed his eyes and struggled.
1:31:32|1:31:38|Then, he turned around and broke free from [Zhou Kai], swimming upstream, only to be grabbed and pushed back into the water by [Zhou Kai] again.
1:31:38|1:31:43|He was unable to break free for a moment, so he could only keep moving his legs in the water and struggling constantly.
1:31:55|1:32:2|Shortly after, [Zhou Kai] swam to the side of the boat and climbed aboard.
1:32:2|1:32:5|Next, Zhou Kai and Zhou Chao helped A Cang onto the small boat.
1:32:5|1:32:13|On the other side, [Zhou Chao] arrived at the port. He found [Zhou Kai]'s ship, then picked the lock and entered the ship, carefully observing the surroundings inside.
1:32:13|1:32:17|Later, he turned around and saw a childhood photo of himself and [Zhou Kai] on the wall.
1:32:19|1:32:24|He stared at the photo thoughtfully, then turned his head to look elsewhere.
1:32:24|1:32:30|He pushed open the door of the cabin on the boat and searched around.
1:32:30|1:32:38|At the same time, on the sea, [A Cang] is tied to the boat, while in the cockpit, [Zhou Kai] is driving the boat looking at the sea, and [Ma Ke] suddenly walks over.
1:32:50|1:33:6|[Ma Ke] took out a box and opened it, [Zhou Kai] watched his actions and then spoke.
1:33:6|1:33:15|On the other side, [Zhou Chao] took out something wrapped in cloth on the boat. After carefully opening it, he saw a pistol and was about to examine it.
1:33:18|1:33:21|At this moment, a strange sound suddenly came from outside.
1:33:21|1:33:25|[Zhou Chao] turned his head to look outside the bed, then walked cautiously towards the door.
1:33:25|1:33:31|At this moment, the phone suddenly rang. He glanced at his pocket, then quickly opened the door and aimed the gun outside.
1:33:31|1:33:36|The seagulls outside were startled and flew up, [Zhou Chao] then relaxed and turned back into the boat.
1:33:36|1:33:42|He took out the vibrating phone, on which appeared a video of Lu Lu being kidnapped, followed by a voice.
1:33:52|1:33:58|He remembered the card Lulu left him, saying to go home, and then he called his colleague.
1:34:11|1:34:21|At this moment, on the sea surface, [Ma Ke] is squatting aside talking to [A Cang], and making a shooting gesture with a pistol against [A Cang]'s head.
1:34:21|1:34:27|On the other side, [Zhou Chao] quickly started the yacht and steered it towards the sea.
1:34:27|1:34:31|The seagulls on the sea were startled by the yacht, while [Zhou Chao] looked anxiously into the distance.
1:34:38|1:34:43|[A Cang] glanced at [Zhou Kai] standing beside him, smiled, and then spoke.
1:34:51|1:34:53|[Zhou Kai] angrily squatted down and grabbed [A Cang].
1:34:57|1:34:59|Then he let go of [A Cang].
1:35:14|1:35:19|[Zhou Kai] stood up silently and then kicked [A Cang] fiercely.
1:35:19|1:35:40|On the calm sea, besides the small boat of [Zhou Kai] and [Zhou Chao], there is [Zhou Chao]'s yacht speeding along. He is seen standing in the cockpit, then turning the steering wheel towards an abandoned factory and driving rapidly. Layers of waves are constantly stirred up on the sea, and soon he docks and slowly stops the yacht.
1:35:44|1:35:47|Shortly after, [Zhou Chao] disembarked and walked ashore.
1:35:47|1:35:50|He looked around and walked up the stairs on the side.
1:35:50|1:35:54|After walking a few steps, [Zhou Kai] squatted down in front of a ruin and hid the pistol he brought.
1:35:54|1:35:57|Then he got up and slowly walked towards old [Ma Ke].
1:35:57|1:35:59|He walked up the stairs of the bar.
1:35:59|1:36:5|He walked up the stairs of the bar and observed the surroundings before entering.
1:36:5|1:36:9|He just walked into the bar and looked around, and then a few people walked out behind him.
1:36:35|1:36:40|[Zhou Chao] raised his hands and allowed himself to be searched after hearing the instructions.
1:36:43|1:36:46|At this moment, [Lulu] is being taken out of the bar by someone.
1:36:46|1:36:54|[Zhou Chao] took a few steps forward, but was blocked by someone in front.
1:36:54|1:36:58|And then, [Lulu] was taken away.
1:36:58|1:37:3|[Zhou Chao] turned around and walked to sit in front of [Zhou Kai], then spoke.
1:37:34|1:37:37|On the other side of the sea, [Zhou Kai] receives a call from [Brother Ha].
1:38:3|1:38:12|After Brother Ha hung up the phone, he punched Zhou Chao, who was tied to a chair. Zhou Kai didn't respond to Ma Ke, but was busy adjusting the direction of the boat.
1:38:25|1:38:28|[Ma Ke] walked over and stuffed [A Cang]'s mouth.
1:38:37|1:38:44|After speaking, Ma Ke took out a gun and sat in the back of the driver's seat, while Zhou Kai drove the boat towards Laomaba.
1:38:44|1:38:55|The sea was calm at this moment, with no waves, the distant sunset gradually setting, while seagulls flew towards the distance.
1:38:55|1:38:59|Night falls, [Zhou Kai] and [Zhou Chao] docked their boat and arrived at old [Ma Ke].
1:38:59|1:39:6|The two men led [A Cang] up the stairs, then arrived on the shore, while [Zhou Chao] stood on the opposite side with his hands tied.
1:39:6|1:39:9|Brother Ha gets off the car at this moment and walks over to look at the two of them.
1:39:35|1:39:38|[Zhou Kai] took a few steps forward and said.
1:40:4|1:40:23|[Zhou Chao] was then pushed forward by someone, and [A Cang] on the opposite side was also pushed forward.
1:40:23|1:40:27|The two men slowly walk towards each other, facing each other.
1:40:30|1:40:40|The two men approached slowly, with [Zhou Chao] suddenly tackling [A Cang] to the ground, taking out the gun he had prepared earlier, and pointing it at [A Cang].
1:40:40|1:41:0|He kidnapped [A Cang] and looked towards [Brother Ha] and others. Suddenly, the person standing on the boat shot and injured [Zhou Chao], causing him to let go and fall to the ground. [Zhou Kai] immediately turned around and shot the person on the boat, while [A Cang] took the opportunity to escape. [Zhou Kai] then helped up the injured [Zhou Chao] and started to retreat, when suddenly, there was a loud noise behind the three of them.
1:41:0|1:41:5|[Zhou Kai], along with others, were immediately knocked down by the aftermath of the bomb explosion, lying on the ground.
1:41:5|1:41:8|Brother Ha and others hid behind the car.
1:41:8|1:41:12|Brother Ha looked at Zhou Kai and the other two, then pressed the button in his hand again.
1:41:12|1:41:19|At this moment, [Zhou Kai] had just slowly stood up, but there was suddenly a second explosion behind him.
1:41:19|1:41:24|Brother Ha quietly observed the three of them from the side, then stood up and spoke.
1:41:26|1:41:30|At this moment, [Zhou Kai] suddenly ran towards [Brother Ha].
1:42:2|1:42:6|[A Cang] suddenly fired a shot at [Brother Ha], shocking everyone.
1:42:44|1:43:1|Finally, the crowd launched a fierce attack on [Zhou Kai] and the other two. [Zhou Chao] was hit in the leg during the fight and fell down. [Zhou Kai] immediately picked up [Zhou Chao] and hid nearby, while [Ma Ke] covered them. Then, the three of them hid together in the ruins, and [Zhou Chao] slowly spoke.
1:43:1|1:43:3|[Zhou Kai] handed the phone to [Zhou Chao].
1:44:1|1:44:5|Outside the ruins, Brother Ha and others are still launching continuous attacks.
1:44:5|1:44:16|[Zhou Kai] and [Ma Ke] exchanged a glance, then resolutely walked out of the ruins and started shooting at the opposite side with their guns. One person on the eighth floor stairs was hit by [Zhou Kai] and fell to the ground.
1:44:16|1:44:23|At this moment, [Zhou Kai] strides forward, raising his gun with both hands, attacking fiercely as he advances.
1:44:23|1:44:34|[Ma Ke] followed closely behind. Suddenly, [Zhou Kai] saw [A Cang] preparing to shoot from the back of the car. He rammed into [Ma Ke], and then was shot by [A Cang] and fell to the ground.
1:44:34|1:44:39|[Ma Ke] was hit and rolled to the ground, then he got up violently and started shooting fiercely at the opposite side.
1:44:39|1:44:44|[Zhou Chao] in the ruins looked at the two men, gritted his teeth and picked up the gun, then shot at the other party.
1:44:44|1:44:54|He struggled to get up and prepare to walk out of the ruins, but was shot in the leg by [A Cang] as soon as he stood up, then fell to the ground, while [Ma Ke] beside him was also hit and fell down.
1:45:6|1:45:12|The people on the opposite side did not react immediately, many of them were hit, and then they ran towards the back of the car to take cover.
1:45:18|1:45:24|At this moment, the car across the street was hit by bullets and suddenly exploded, sending many people flying.
1:45:24|1:45:29|At this moment, [Zhou Kai] stood up despite the pain and continued to attack the opponent with [Ma Ke].
1:45:29|1:45:35|But facing a large number of opponents, [Zhou Kai] stood up and was shot several times in a row.
1:45:35|1:45:38|Ma Ke, who was standing aside, was also hit by a bullet and fell to the ground.
1:45:38|1:45:46|[Zhou Kai], [Zhou Chao], and [Ma Ke] were lying on the ground, barely breathing, slowly moving their bodies, as the gunfire around them gradually faded away.
1:45:47|1:46:9|And hiding behind the car, [A Cang] slowly walked out when he saw that the car tail was not moving, approaching the three of them and starting to speak.
1:46:33|1:46:35|[A Cang] looked fiercely at [Zhou Kai] on the ground.
1:46:37|1:46:45|At this moment, a sound suddenly came from the ruins. [A Cang] turned his head to look at the ruins, only to see [Zhou Chao] slowly walking out of the ruins, bending over.
1:46:45|1:46:53|He prepared to pick up the gun on the ground with one fist and one crutch, while [A Cang] watched him move slowly without giving up, then smiled.
1:46:53|1:47:2|At this moment, [Zhou Kai] lying on the side suddenly spoke.
1:47:2|1:47:4|[A Cang] looked at the weak [Zhou Kai], while [Zhou Kai] continued to speak.
1:47:18|1:47:23|At this moment, [Ma Ke] was also weakly lying on the ground, looking at [A Cang] and [Zhou Kai].
1:47:23|1:47:26|At this moment, [Zhou Chao] slowly raised the gun and aimed it at [A Cang].
1:47:26|1:47:33|[A Cang] slowly stood up and looked at [Zhou Chao].
1:47:33|1:47:36|He then raised his hand and fired the gun, [Zhou Chao] fell to the ground again.
1:47:47|1:47:49|[A Cang] finished speaking and prepared to leave.
1:47:49|1:47:57|At this moment, [Zhou Chao] looks at [Zhou Kai] and then slowly reaches out his hand.
1:47:57|1:48:0|Suddenly a gunshot rang out, and [A Cang]'s henchman fell to the ground.
1:48:3|1:48:11|The special police force can be seen approaching slowly with shields from a distance, while a large number of police cars are also rushing to support.
1:48:11|1:48:18|[A Cang] saw this and hurriedly ran to the shore to get on the boat and escape, only to see [Ma Ke] suddenly pick up a gun and aim it at him.
1:48:18|1:48:21|With a gunshot, [A Cang] fell heavily into the sea.
1:49:16|1:49:24|Afterwards, a large number of police officers arrived in cars, while Ma Ke and Zhou Chao kept moving their bodies, crawling towards Zhou Kai.
1:49:24|1:49:28|The three of them leaned together in difficulty, at this moment, [Ma Ke] slowly spoke.
1:50:0|1:50:16|At this moment, [Brother Ha] suddenly exerted all his strength to press the last button. The interior of Lao Ma Bar suddenly exploded, causing Guo Dui and Lu Lu to be knocked down by the aftermath of the explosion. Then the two of them staggered out of Lao Ma Bar.
1:50:16|1:50:24|At this moment, the screen displays a dedication to family and close friends.
