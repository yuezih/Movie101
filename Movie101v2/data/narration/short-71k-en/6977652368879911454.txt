0:0:51|0:1:6|[You You] took the camera, examined it carefully, skillfully opened the film, checked it, and accurately installed the film. The whole process was skilled and experienced. Then he picked up the camera from the table, held it tightly with both hands, and pressed it close to his side with his right hand.
0:1:6|0:1:14|He steadied the camera on his shoulder and then opened the viewfinder, aiming it at [Lucy] in front of him to start filming.
0:4:38|0:4:57|In the dimly lit imperial palace bedroom, a woman is lying on the bed in pain, gasping for breath. The midwife in the palace is helping her give birth. She exerts all her strength, shouts out one last time, and the director [Taylor] calls her. The live performance stops.
0:5:1|0:5:8|[You You] is shooting [Taylor] next to her. At this moment, [Taylor] is looking very solemnly at the monitor in front of him, showing the footage just shot.
0:5:17|0:5:24|[Taylor] took a deep breath and replied with a simple "hello". The staff member wearing a hat turned and spoke.
0:5:31|0:5:43|The actors continued their performance, [Taylor] stood up from his seat, turned around and entered the filming scene. He raised his hand to signal the filming to stop, while [You You] quickly followed with the heavy camera.
0:5:43|0:5:52|[Taylor] walks up to the actress who is simulating giving birth on the bed, covering her with a blanket while speaking to her.
0:6:1|0:6:22|Rising to shoot another scene in the movie, the young actor playing the last emperor of the Qing Dynasty, Puyi, sat high on the dragon throne. Below, hundreds of extras sat, a group of actors playing civil and military officials hurriedly sat down in neat steps.
0:8:23|0:8:39|[Taylor] burst into laughter, as the laughter subsided, the scene cut back to the set where the young actor playing the emperor was drinking cola under the scorching sun. The makeup artist was removing his heavy hat, while [Taylor] sat motionless in a chair, lost in thought.
0:9:6|0:9:23|After Lucy finished speaking to him, Taylor dropped the folder in his hand. The actors on set all stood up. Lucy walked through the crowd of actors to where Taylor was sitting in a chair, and spoke to him.
0:10:20|0:10:42|[Taylor] asked. [You You] carried a camera on her shoulder and spoke in broken English. Seeing that he didn't understand, she took the camera off her shoulder, took out a coin, and then threw the coin into the cup next to her.
0:11:8|0:11:33|Hundreds of extras in the audience cheered loudly when they heard the word "wrap", slowly leaving the Forbidden City. Peter leaned against the door, sighed as he looked at his notes, then turned around and slammed the door, muttering a curse. The scene shifted to outside the filming location, where the props truck of the crew was parked haphazardly on the open ground. [Tony] emerged from one of the cars, wearing a trench coat.
0:11:33|0:11:40|He raised his hand and held Peter's hand, while the other hand closed the car door and said to him.
0:14:57|0:15:24|The face that was smiling just now turned gloomy, and he went to a temple with [Lucy]. [You You] was still filming, and [Lucy] also lit a match in the temple hall, lit a candle and handed it to [Taylor]. The presiding monk in the temple recited scriptures, while [Lucy] stood by and translated for him.
0:15:37|0:15:43|Lucy impatiently waved her hand at him, indicating him to quickly go change the film.
0:16:10|0:16:30|[Lucy] made a snide remark, then handed him some money. After speaking, [You You] turned and went to pick up a few stones under a nearby tree. [Lucy] walked to where he pointed, and the two squatted down on the open ground. Then [You You] placed the stones on the ground and gestured.
0:18:24|0:18:29|After speaking, she extended a hand to signal [You You] to give money, and [You You] reluctantly took out money from her pocket and handed it to him.
0:19:7|0:19:20|[Taylor] said to [Lucy], and after that, the two hugged each other. They talked about the comedy funeral. After leaving the temple, [You You] wore a helmet and rode a motorcycle on the road, still muttering the English words of the comedy funeral.
0:19:20|0:19:26|He rode his motorcycle into the filming location of the movie, where the crew members were bustling about.
0:19:26|0:19:30|At the corner, [You You] almost bumped into someone and couldn't help muttering a few words under her breath.
0:19:30|0:19:37|He quickly parked the motorcycle in a nearby spot, ran to the car, picked up the camera, and started filming out the window.
0:20:44|0:21:0|Peter patted [Taylor]'s back and said to him. Then he got up from the table. [You You] was recording the conversation with a camera on the side. [Taylor] picked up the milk in front of him and took a sip, struggling to swallow it. [You You] noticed something was wrong in the camera and quickly looked up at [Taylor].
0:21:0|0:21:13|Milk dripped from [Taylor]'s lips, but he didn't care at all. He slowly stood up from the dining table, slightly moved the chair, grabbed the RV next to him, and the wind tousled his hair.
0:21:13|0:21:21|[You You] looked down at the camera, continuing to capture everything. [Taylor] struggled to climb into the RV, with milk still lingering on his beard.
0:21:21|0:21:35|He stepped onto the car step by step, then he grabbed the RV handrail and shouted outside. Upon hearing this, [You You] quickly turned off the camera and looked at him. [Taylor] asked him to bring the camera over, he hesitated and pointed at the camera, but still brought the camera into the car.
0:21:40|0:21:47|[Taylor] asked him to change to a new roll of film. He took out a new roll of film and replaced it, then [Taylor] asked how long the new roll of film could shoot for.
0:21:53|0:22:9|[Taylor] asked [You You] to sit in front of the camera, and told [You You] to unzip the waist bag around her waist, put it on the chair beside her, then walk to the front of the camera. [Taylor] looked at the screen of the camera, asked [You You] to sit down, and adjusted [You You]'s position.
0:22:9|0:22:16|He then opened the camera, hunched over with a bowed back, gripping the handle inside the car, and laboriously walked towards [You You].
0:22:18|0:22:23|He sat next to [You You], took off the watch on his wrist and handed it to [You You], saying.
0:23:30|0:23:46|Taylor suddenly fell to the ground, causing [You You] to panic. He hurriedly got off the car and called out [Lucy]'s name, only to bump into the camera. The ambulance quickly arrived at the movie set, and Taylor was lifted onto a stretcher by medical staff. [Lucy] and [You You] anxiously watched Taylor on the stretcher, while the staff on set also looked at this disastrous scene.
0:23:46|0:24:4|In front of everyone's eyes, Taylor is pushed onto the ambulance. The scene shifts to the hospital emergency room, where Taylor, wearing an oxygen mask and hospital gown, is being buttoned up by a nurse. With his eyes closed, Taylor has already lost consciousness.
0:24:14|0:24:20|[Tony] quickly drove to the hospital with Peter to visit Taylor after learning about his accident.
0:24:20|0:24:40|Upon arriving at the hospital, the two quickly got out of the car and headed towards the emergency building. Inside the ward, [Lucy] held Taylor's hand. When they heard the door opening, he quickly turned his head, tears in his eyes. [Tony] held his hand and he looked at Taylor on the hospital bed, saying to [Lucy].
0:24:58|0:25:7|[You You] looked at the closed door and then realized that he didn't want to leave. He wanted to enter the ward again, but Peter stopped him and said,
0:25:7|0:25:29|[You You] hesitated for a moment, gesturing with his hand, and then wanted to enter the ward. Peter pushed him away again. He shouted at him loudly. After being rejected one after another, [You You] suddenly got angry. He took off his glasses, rolled up his sleeves, and Peter put on sunglasses, patted his suit jacket, gesturing for [You You] to come over.
0:25:32|0:25:51|[You You] approached Peter but was pushed away again. After swearing at him, he rushed up and hugged Peter, and they started wrestling. Both of them blushed instantly. [You You] then used his forehead to press against Peter's forehead, neither of them giving in. After struggling for a while, the misunderstanding was finally resolved.
0:27:37|0:27:44|No matter how hard [Lucy] kneels on the ground and screams his name, it's no use. After the scene, [You You] asks,
0:28:28|0:29:1|[You You] was watching a video about funerals on the TV at home. He changed to a new tape when a slightly chubby man in a suit walked into the room. He was wearing a funny pair of glasses and dropped his briefcase before quickly rushing into the bathroom. This man is [Wang Xiaozhu], an old friend of [You You]. After using the toilet, he fastened his belt, zipped up his pants, and walked out of the bathroom. [You You] said to him,
0:31:44|0:32:0|[Wang Xiaozhu] finally remembered who Taler was that [Wang Xiaozhu] mentioned. He patted [You You] on the shoulder. Meanwhile, on the other side, [Lucy] walked into a Japanese restaurant. The waiter opened the door for her and greeted her in Japanese, while Peter spoke to him in the hallway.
0:33:18|0:33:24|The Japanese producers were very dissatisfied with [Lucy]'s attitude, while [You You] was shooting in a studio at the moment.
0:33:51|0:34:12|[Lucy] finished leaving a message for [You You] on the phone, then started packing up her personal belongings in the trailer on set. It was pouring rain outside with thunder and lightning. She rushed out with a box, trying to put her luggage under the awning, but still got soaked by the heavy rain. She quickly sealed the cardboard box with tape. She was the only one at the night shoot location.
0:34:16|0:34:40|After a while, [You You] drove to the set and persuaded [Lucy] to take shelter in the car. He braved the heavy rain to move [Lucy]'s luggage into the trunk, one by one. Finally finishing loading all the luggage, he closed the trunk door, quickly got into the car, started the engine, and left the set. Both of them were soaked through, with [Lucy] looking extremely disheveled. He didn't care at all about the rainwater wetting and scattering her hair on her forehead.
0:34:54|0:35:14|[Lucy] smiled at [You You], then used her hand to push her hair aside, looking out the window. When they got home, [You You] carried the luggage from the car into the living room and haphazardly placed it on the floor. After changing clothes, [You You] cooked a bowl of soup for [Lucy] while he snacked on some snacks himself. Then he moved the stainless steel basin that was catching rainwater.
0:35:14|0:35:19|Ensure the basin catches the raindrops sliding down from the damaged roof more accurately.
0:35:19|0:35:25|He then pulled open the bag beside him and took out a golf club to play with.
0:35:29|0:35:48|After finishing speaking, he gestured with a golf club in his hands as if playing golf, completely unaware of the emotional change in [Lucy] at the moment. [Lucy] and his hands stopped, he put down the spoon and covered his face with his hand, tears uncontrollably streaming down. It was only then that [You You] realized that his words just now were somewhat inappropriate.
0:35:52|0:36:8|He took out a handkerchief from the bathroom and handed it to [Lucy], who burst into tears. [You You] sat on a distant chair, picked up a glass of water and took two sips.
0:36:35|0:36:51|Upon hearing [Lucy] say this, [You You] was momentarily at a loss for what to do. He seemed to be nailed to the chair, motionless for a long time. After a while, he slowly got up from the chair, and his legs, as if filled with cement, moved laboriously in [Lucy]'s direction.
0:36:58|0:37:21|[You You] picked up the golf club in her hand again, which she had never put down. Then [Lucy] packed up her luggage quickly, got into a taxi, and insisted on going to the hospital to visit [Taylor]. Without stopping her, [You You] closed the door and watched the taxi leave. She stood there with her hands in her pockets, looking in the direction the taxi had gone.
0:37:21|0:37:55|Back home, sitting on the chair from earlier, he recalls the scene just now. He suddenly stands up from the chair, making some inappropriate movements while holding the chair that [Lucy] was sitting on. Then he releases the chair, stands up and takes a deep breath. Turning around, he walks towards the chair from earlier, pretending that [Lucy] is still sitting there, gently caressing his head.
0:38:11|0:38:30|He gently stroked the plate with his thumb, as if the plate was really [Lucy]'s face. He gazed affectionately at the plate, and couldn't help but bend down to kiss it. Unexpectedly, the plate cracked in the middle, splitting into two halves, pulling him back from his fantasy to reality.
0:39:2|0:39:14|The next day, [You You] met with [Lucy] and [Wang Xiaozhu], who had changed his short sleeves to a formal suit.
0:39:59|0:40:12|After [Wang Xiaozhu] finished speaking, he reached out to shake hands with [Lucy], gesturing for the person next to them to quickly take a photo. [You You] stepped aside to make room for the two to take a picture.
0:41:33|0:41:48|[Wang Xiaozhu] released a video he made on TV, showing a map of China followed by an image of Tiananmen Square. The camera then moved, rapidly switching between several images before settling on one, prompting a comment from [Lucy].
0:41:50|0:41:57|After the video ended, [Wang Xiaozhu] stood up from the chair.
0:43:38|0:43:51|He picked up the remote control and played a video on the TV again. The background music of the video was "Friends" composed by Zang Tianshuo himself. In the footage, there appeared a cartoon avatar of [Taylor], followed by a hand playing the piano.
0:45:5|0:45:15|The magician then made a gesture, and [Taylor]'s soul drifted into a cannonball, which was shot out, sending his soul flying into the Milky Way, drifting endlessly.
0:45:15|0:45:22|[Taylor]'s soul was sucked into a black hole, he somersaulted in the air, and then turned into a child.
0:49:1|0:49:25|[Wang Xiaozhu] has already started preparing for the funeral with great enthusiasm, while [Taylor] is still lying in the hospital bed. [Lucy] has filled the ward with flowers, holding another pot of flowers and taking it to the balcony of the ward. She then opens the window and places the flowers outside to bask in the sun. [You You] arrives at the balcony on a motorcycle.
0:49:36|0:49:44|After he finished speaking, he turned and walked towards the hospital, and [Lucy] also walked out of the ward.
0:49:58|0:50:7|Hearing this, [You You] pointed incredulously at the door of [Taylor]'s hospital room and said,
0:50:18|0:50:33|[Lucy] was somewhat disappointed in [You You]. After speaking, she walked towards the ward, leaving [You You] standing alone in place, feeling a bit helpless and frustrated.
0:55:24|0:55:28|After [You You] finished speaking and rode away on her motorcycle, [Wang Xiaozhu] continued to figure out a solution.
0:57:19|0:57:25|Lucy heard that they were just trying to make money, without saying a word she got up and left downstairs, Wang Xiaozhu and You You also left, You You said to Wang Xiaozhu,
0:58:8|0:58:34|[Lucy] also turned to a church, which was still under construction and not officially open to the public. The administrator inside handed her a safety helmet. She turned to the administrator and said thank you, then put on the safety helmet. With a devout expression, she faced the church, interlaced her fingers in front of her chest, closed her eyes to pray. Then she released her hands and made the sign of the cross in front of her chest. She then turned around and took off the safety helmet.
0:58:34|0:58:36|Walk down the steps and hand it back to the administrator just now.
0:58:38|0:58:59|The administrator took the safety helmet and walked ahead, opened the iron gate for [Lucy], who looked around and saw no vehicles. She crossed to the other side of the road and took a car to the hospital. Walking through the hospital corridor, she arrived at the door of [Taylor]'s ward, pushed it open, and saw a group of nurses and doctors gathered around [Taylor]'s bed. After a while, she went to the airport.
0:58:59|0:59:7|He couldn't help but cry when he hugged [Tony], who had just gotten off the plane. [Tony] gently patted his back to comfort him.
1:0:17|1:0:31|The flashlights were flashing crazily in the audience, with [Wang Xiaozhu] standing with one hand behind his back and the other hand raised to signal for quiet. He adjusted his tie collar and picked up the prepared script to speak.
1:2:5|1:2:10|Applause erupted from the audience as [Wang Xiaozhu] stepped down from the stage, almost stumbling. [You You] glanced at him and then said,
1:2:30|1:2:36|On the screen, a black and white image of [Taylor] is projected.
1:3:14|1:3:28|The auction resumed, and after the auctioneer's final hammer strike, the projection screen switched to an advertisement for a steakhouse chain. [Lucy] shouted at the sky, while [Tony] stood by, making a phone call to someone.
1:3:41|1:3:49|This time the successful bidder is Love VCD Company, [You You] walked from the audience to the stage and whispered something in the auctioneer's ear.
1:4:46|1:4:56|[You You] looked up and announced the rules for the third round of the auction to the advertisers below the stage. The projection behind her changed from an image of [Taylor] to one promoting anti-piracy and protecting intellectual property rights.
1:4:56|1:5:7|[You You] walked out of the auction room, went to the bathroom, and while washing his hands, suddenly felt a gaze behind him. At this moment, [Wang Xiaozhu] had already approached him and pointed at [You You], questioning him.
1:5:38|1:5:53|[Wang Xiaozhu] was pinned against the wall and scolded by [You You], stunned in place. He clearly did not expect [You You] to treat him like this. As [You You] left the restroom and opened the door to the auction room, a group of reporters rushed towards him.
1:8:24|1:8:32|Shortly after, [You You] rode a motorcycle carrying [Lucy] to the funeral scene, where the funeral hostess was taking a break. Seeing [You You] arrive, she complained under her breath.
1:8:36|1:8:41|Complaining as he stood up and walked to the steps, [You You] and [Lucy] walked towards them with a sun umbrella.
1:9:12|1:9:21|After saying that, [Lucy] walked towards the inside and pushed open the door.
1:14:15|1:14:35|The two of them walked down the steps while discussing, [Lucy] also got on [You You]'s motorcycle. By this time, the sun had already toned down its glaring light, and the red glow descended slowly, painting half the sky red. After [You You] dropped [Lucy] off at the hospital and left, [Lucy] pushed [Taylor] in a wheelchair to relax in the hospital park. [Taylor] said.
1:15:12|1:15:20|Early the next morning, [You You] started working on the funeral arrangements. He was putting up advertisements on the hearse, while [Wang Xiaozhu] drove up next to the hearse.
1:18:7|1:18:17|He used a chainsaw to cut open the mouth of the model representing [Taylor], [Lucy] watched his actions in disbelief, [You You] blew off the dust, picked up the tea leaves next to him, and hung them on the model's mouth.
1:18:32|1:18:39|He placed the shampoo directly next to the model's hair,
1:19:2|1:19:20|After finishing the ad slogan, he thought for a moment, then stood up and walked to the side. [Lucy] didn't understand what he was doing, her eyes following him. She saw [You You] bring over an ashtray. He took off the model's wig, combed it neatly with a comb, and put it back on the model's head. He picked up the cigarette ash from the ashtray with his fingers.
1:19:32|1:19:37|Upon hearing [Lucy] say this, [You You] emptied the ashtray full of cigarette butts onto the model's head.
1:20:38|1:21:2|[Lucy] seems very eager to see this scene, urging Biao Ge to start the performance quickly. Biao Ge quickly gets into character, slowly walking towards the model representing [Taylor]. As he looks at the model in front of him, he quickly gets into the rehearsal mode. He pushes away the water cup handed to him by the agent, and the agent places the cup on the table in front of him. The agent then hands him a cigarette, and this time he doesn't refuse, taking the cigarette from the agent's hand.
1:21:2|1:21:8|Throughout the whole process, he never looked at his agent, his eyes fixed firmly on the face of the model representing [Taylor].
1:21:8|1:21:23|He opened the cigarette case, took out a cigarette and put it in his mouth. His agent took out a lighter to light the cigarette for him. After taking a puff, he slowly took the cigarette out of his mouth, his fingers holding the cigarette trembling slightly, as if he was about to cry in the next second.
1:21:23|1:21:56|Lucy put a bottle into Biao Ge's pocket, Biao Ge slowly bent down and bowed deeply to the model in front of him. You You, Lucy, and Wang Xiaozhu all bent over to look at Biao Ge. Biao Ge had been bending over all the time, and when he stood up, tears were already streaming down his face. He called out Taylor's name and hugged the model in front of him, choking up.
1:22:38|1:22:45|They then went to the funeral scene, suddenly a group of people holding baseball bats, wearing sunglasses, walked towards them.
1:24:26|1:24:41|Upon seeing the group of people planning to disrupt the funeral scene, [You You] quickly intervened. He took the boss who wanted to advertise mineral water to a music hall, where very sad funeral music was being played. The scene also transitioned from color to a heavy black.
1:24:41|1:24:50|The boss of the mineral water company, holding a baseball bat, rhythmically tapped on the ground. After listening to the live music for a while, he turned to [You You] and said,
1:25:10|1:25:32|Upon hearing this, [You You] sighed, unsure of how to deal with this difficult boss. Suddenly, an idea struck him and he got up, walked over to the conductor, and whispered a few words in his ear. The conductor then stopped the music being played on stage with his baton, and proceeded to give the team new instructions on the piece to be performed.
1:25:50|1:26:5|The previous melancholy was played at double speed and completely different from the previous style, changing the sad atmosphere to a cheerful one. The movie scene also transitioned from black and white to normal color, as if a cheerful musician led people out of the gloom of sadness.
1:26:5|1:26:28|The new song was very much to the liking of the mineral water boss. He was seen lightly tugging at his small beard with two fingers, swaying to the rhythm of the music. Just then, [You You] waved towards the door, and several girls in skirts, holding mineral water in their hands, walked into the concert hall. They stood in the middle of the orchestra and sang the brand name of the mineral water, Le Ha Ha. On the side, [Lucy] finally couldn't stand it anymore and walked out of the broadcast hall without looking back.
1:27:4|1:27:11|[Lucy] didn't want to see [You You] continue like this. She finally couldn't bear to keep hiding the truth and blurted out the long-hidden secret to [You You].
1:27:11|1:27:20|After she finished speaking and walked away, [You You] stood still, digesting what [Lucy] had said, as the sky gradually darkened.
1:27:20|1:27:27|[Taylor] lay on the bed at the funeral scene, while [Lucy] paced back and forth towards him, complaining irritably.
1:30:11|1:30:20|[Lucy] rolled her eyes at him. Meanwhile, [You You] lay on the bed looking melancholic.
1:30:20|1:30:27|[Wang Xiaozhu] ran aggressively towards [You You]'s house,
1:30:57|1:31:4|[Wang Xiaozhu] pulled [You You], who was lying on the bed, and [You You] sat up with empty eyes. Remembering what [Lucy] had said in the afternoon, he covered his face with his hands.
1:31:8|1:31:16|Upon hearing [You You]'s words, [Wang Xiaozhu]'s state was no different from that of [You You] in the afternoon. The two sat on the bed, letting time pass by, unaware of how long had passed.
1:31:17|1:31:23|[You You] is wearing pajamas and playing table tennis against the wall in a ping pong room.
1:34:21|1:34:33|Originally, [You You] and [Wang Xiaozhu] couldn't accept the fact that [Taylor] was still alive for a moment, and they developed some mental illness. When [Lucy] went to see him, his condition was still very serious, and the doctor planned to give him electroconvulsive therapy.
1:34:42|1:34:48|[You You] shyly turned his head, no longer looking at [Lucy],
1:34:59|1:35:6|On the other side, [Wang Xiaozhu] is undergoing electroshock therapy, with the psychiatrist repeatedly stimulating him with electric shocks. He is gasping for breath, his heart pounding wildly.
1:35:6|1:35:15|His eyelids were twitching uncontrollably, he muttered something in English about feeling comfortable, then collapsed onto the chair in the electrotherapy room. In the hospital ward, a group of psychiatric patients were chatting.
1:37:51|1:38:4|[You You] placed two folders on the long table in the ward, and placed a pen next to each folder. The mental patients around him were clapping behind him. [Wang Xiaozhu] and [Walker] walked to the table and sat down. [You You] extended his hand to signal the applause to stop.
1:38:4|1:38:26|While [Wang Xiaozhu] and [Taylor] were signing with their heads down, he pretended to stamp with something that wasn't a seal, then exchanged the folders in front of the two. As the two were signing on the paper, [You You] quickly stamped the seal, and [Wang Xiaozhu] and [Taylor] stood up and shook hands.
1:41:59|1:42:21|Lucy heard Taylor's words, gave him a happy smile, then turned to look at someone in the distance with love in her eyes. After a while, she walked up to the RV where You You was using small scissors to trim the beard on his chin. He saw Lucy walking towards him, stopped his actions, and stared intently at Lucy with his two eyes.
1:43:15|1:43:20|After [You You] finished speaking, he walked behind [Lucy], cupped her face, and slowly lifted her head.
1:43:20|1:43:28|On the monitor, [Taylor] watched as the two people were about to kiss, but the distance between them held them back.
1:43:37|1:43:55|On the monitor, [Taylor] watching the two who were not successful yet appeared a bit anxious, he said. Then he looked at the monitor and shouted out another, cut.
