0:0:20|0:0:30|At night, a soldier celebrates loudly in the street shirtless, after years he can finally return to his hometown.
0:0:30|0:0:36|Subsequently, on January 8, 1919, the 27 victorious countries in World War I convened a conference in Paris.
0:0:44|0:0:53|In the Palace of Versailles in Paris, British Prime Minister [George] Lowe and French Prime Minister Crinoso are deep in conversation, each with their own intentions to divide some benefits. China, as one of the victorious countries, has the right to participate in the meeting. At this moment, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, [Gu Weijun], is on his way.
0:1:8|0:1:22|He will represent China in the negotiations, dressed in a suit with a checkered tie at the collar. The suit fits him well, with smooth lines that complement [Gu Weijun]'s demeanor perfectly. He sits calmly in the car, looking very confident.
0:1:22|0:1:32|Tensions rose at the negotiation table, with the British and French representatives disagreeing. Xiao Kejian slammed the table in anger, then stormed out, leaving the rest of the people furious.
0:1:32|0:1:50|The next day at the meeting, after the Japanese Makino Shinken finished reading, Fa Yingyi raised her hand in agreement, while [Gu Weijun] occasionally looked out the window, not speaking, and then withdrew his gaze as if pondering something. He sighed lightly, looking very stressed, but his night-time cultivation had enabled him to develop a habit of remaining calm even when Mount Tai collapses in front of him.
0:1:50|0:2:3|The carriage traveled for a long time, from dawn to dusk, with no lights on the roadside and darkness all around, only the moonlight evenly shining down to barely illuminate the road. Nevertheless, [Gu Weijun] did not stop, he continued to drive the carriage without stopping.
0:2:3|0:2:13|The carriage passed through an area paved with neatly arranged tiles. After a night of bumps, the carriage had arrived at the Saint Star Cathedral, and was about to reach the Palace of Versailles.
0:2:13|0:2:22|The sun was slowly rising at this moment, with the faint morning light casting a unique charm on the church. However, [Gu Weijun] had no time to appreciate it, his expression serious and his eyes slightly swollen.
0:2:23|0:2:25|After the end of World War I, China, as one of the victorious countries, participated in the Paris Peace Conference.
0:3:19|0:3:30|The carriage continued to gallop, [Gu Weijun] knew the importance of this meeting well. Whether the current situation of China being at the mercy of others can be changed, and whether its international status can be improved, are all closely related to this meeting.
0:3:30|0:3:41|On the street, a group of French refugees were walking expressionlessly. Among them, few were in good health, some were using crutches, some were wrapped in bandages, and some had even lost their legs, looking miserable.
0:3:41|0:4:0|War has just ended, social order is chaotic, and homeless people can be seen everywhere on the streets. The roads are narrow, and when carriages pass by, they need to stick close to the walls to avoid being hit. The carriage continues forward, reaching an even narrower road where refugees happen to be passing through. A large crowd completely blocks this road, creating a chaotic scene.
0:4:0|0:4:2|Both teams are caught in a dilemma.
0:4:2|0:4:5|[Gu Weijun] intended to make way for them, but the space did not allow it.
0:4:5|0:4:10|He looked around and saw these people with sinister expressions, glaring at him as if they wanted to devour him alive.
0:4:10|0:4:15|After a brief standoff, the refugees grew even angrier as they saw the other side not moving.
0:4:15|0:4:20|They brandished their canes, flexing their muscles and preparing to step forward to give him a harsh lesson.
0:4:20|0:4:24|[Gu Weijun] saw the situation was not good and wanted to leave, but felt powerless to do so in the middle.
0:4:25|0:4:41|While [Gu Weijun] was considering how to respond, the refugees had already launched an attack. They smashed the car windows with a crutch, someone climbed onto the roof and pounded the roof with force, someone strangled the coachman's neck without letting go, and they were very ruthless. Like a pack of mad dogs, they crazily tore and bit at the carriage.
0:4:41|0:4:44|[Gu Weijun] could only use his arms to block the attacks, barely avoiding them.
0:4:44|0:4:52|At the same time, in the Paris LÃ¼te Hotel where the Chinese delegation is staying, the secretary is hurrying downstairs to inform the representatives in their rooms about relevant matters.
0:5:5|0:5:12|Wang Zhengting smiled knowingly as the five-colored flag slowly rose above the hotel at 8 o'clock in the morning, accompanied by the national anthem of the Republic of China.
0:5:12|0:5:17|The delegation dancers are dressed in traditional Chinese Han clothing, standing tall and spirited.
0:5:17|0:5:20|A crowd gathers outside the hotel, participating in the flag-raising ceremony together.
0:5:49|0:6:0|As soon as the words fell, the sound of horse hooves could be heard. [Gu Weijun] rode a carriage and hurried over. Everyone stretched their necks to look at him with a look of watching a show, their eyes showing curiosity.
0:6:0|0:6:9|The original coachman was injured and replaced with a new one. The carriage still looked intact, with only some broken glass. Looking through the glass, [Gu Weijun] appeared exhausted and extremely disheveled.
0:6:10|0:6:17|The once neatly tailored clothes hung on the body like rags, the bow tie had also come undone, weakly pounding against the neck.
0:6:17|0:6:22|[Gu Weijun] fell asleep in the carriage, and when the carriage stopped, he suddenly woke up and got off the car.
0:6:22|0:6:28|Although his clothes were a mess, the wisdom in his eyes made people unconsciously overlook his attire.
0:6:28|0:6:33|Mei's companions were all shocked to see his appearance, [Gu Weijun] glanced around and then quickly joined them.
0:6:35|0:6:40|In a palace, the French Prime Minister and the President of the Paris Peace Conference, Clemenceau, are receiving visitors with their entourage.
0:6:40|0:6:44|He loudly cursed the American President Wilson, his actions becoming more violent.
0:6:44|0:6:52|He is not satisfied with the various treaties proposed by the United States, abolishing secret diplomacy, neither ceding territory nor paying indemnities, which he finds outrageous.
0:6:52|0:6:57|Klimson wants to make a big profit from this meeting and squeeze out everything he can.
0:6:57|0:7:1|Subsequently, they were squeezed dry like oranges.
0:7:1|0:7:4|When speaking, his gaze is sharp, full of ambition. 
0:7:4|0:7:7|Alec smiled slyly, fully agreeing with his idea.
0:7:7|0:7:9|[Kyle Mengsu] burst into laughter immediately.
0:7:9|0:7:14|Not long after, [Lu Zhengxiang] and [Gu Weijun] arrived here, both dressed very elegantly in suits.
0:7:14|0:7:19|After inquiring with the secretary, Mei was allowed to go to the second floor to meet with [Kerry Mansu].
0:7:19|0:7:33|The Chinese delegation hopes to regain Shandong from Germany, abolish the 21 Demands, and cancel the privileges of foreigners in China through the Paris Peace Conference.
0:7:33|0:7:47|Unfortunately, just a few days before the conference, we received notice that China, originally allocated five seats, was only given two.
0:7:48|0:7:51|Chris Mengso greeted them warmly and said hello to [Lu Zhengxiang] when they entered.
0:7:51|0:7:56|[Lu Zhengxiang] shook hands with a smile on his face and introduced [Gu Weijun] to him.
0:7:56|0:8:11|The class ended, [Chris Mengso] began to show his true colors. He first mentioned that he was having a headache about Asian affairs, and then he brought up the fact that the North Koreans had been waiting downstairs, which put him in a difficult position. [Lu Zhengxiang] and the others understood the implications of his words.
0:8:11|0:8:20|[Gu Weijun] frowned, at this moment [Kerry Mengsu] invited them to sit down, but [Gu Weijun] walked up to him, with a mocking yet very polite retort.
0:8:27|0:8:37|[Kyle Monsour] slowly regained consciousness, his face showing a hint of confusion. He bluntly accused [Gu Weijun] of being too arrogant, and then ordered them to wait in the living room before arrogantly leaving while smoking a cigar.
0:8:37|0:8:48|[Lu Zhengxiang] glanced at [Gu Weijun], his face showing a look of disappointment. At that moment, his men approached and escorted them out of the living room. [Eric] on the other hand, leisurely started whistling.
0:8:48|0:9:2|It's already three o'clock in the afternoon. Three alarm clocks in the living room simultaneously ring to indicate the time. [Gu Weijun] paces back and forth in the room, while [Lu Zhengxiang] remains calm, leaning on a chair and wiping his cane. He occasionally glances at [Gu Weijun], and seeing him so anxious, he calls out to him.
0:10:45|0:10:49|The two had a disagreement, and [Lu Zhengxiang] angrily got up and left.
0:10:49|0:10:52|And at this moment, [Xiao Kejian] was smugly adjusting his appearance.
0:10:56|0:11:1|[Mei] walked past him and played the tune again, making [Xiao Kejian] smile even more.
0:11:2|0:11:15|After a long time, [Gu Weijun] was bored and drawing aimlessly. He drew a tiger with a face resembling [Xiao Kejian], complete with a big beard and pimpled eyes. Even the tiger's posture was very similar to [Xiao Kejian], with a short neck and a big belly.
0:11:15|0:11:24|[Gu Weijun] wrote swiftly, with a look of disdain on his face. [Lu Zhengxiang] strolled behind him in front of the bookcase, couldn't help but laugh when he saw his painting.
0:11:24|0:11:28|During the war, [Xiao Kejian] had a nickname, which was Tiger.
0:11:35|0:11:39|As soon as the words fell, [Xiao Kejian] led a large group of people to walk over in a bustling manner.
0:11:39|0:11:42|This time they were all neatly dressed, not as casual as before.
0:11:52|0:11:56|[Xiao Kejian] picked up the painting on the table and then walked towards the desk.
0:11:56|0:11:59|After shaking hands with [Lu Zhengxiang], others also took their seats one after another.
0:12:4|0:12:24|[Lv Zhengxiang] narrated the issue eloquently, pointing out that during the war, the French and British governments promised China that if it joined the war, it would be treated as a major power after the war and receive five seats at the conference. However, they were now informed that there were only two seats. [Lv Zhengxiang] remained composed while recounting the story, but his tone revealed a strong sense of oppression. [Chris Mengsong] furrowed his brow.
0:12:24|0:12:32|After [Lu Zhengxiang] finished speaking, he paused for a moment before slowly speaking, shifting the blame to Japan, whose attitude towards China's position was very tough.
0:12:45|0:12:49|[Gu Weijun] took out the relevant documents from the file bag and handed them to [Clay Montsou].
0:12:49|0:12:53|[Kyle Mengso] quickly scanned a glance, snorted, he thought.
0:12:57|0:13:2|He then changed the subject and asked [Gu Weijun] why he had been standing all the time, urging him to sit down quickly.
0:13:4|0:13:6|[Kyle Mengso] asked in confusion about the reason.
0:13:6|0:13:8|Gu Weijun said firmly.
0:13:11|0:13:17|[Mei] heard this and turned to look at [Chris Manso], an official who was already so nervous that he had stood up slightly.
0:13:17|0:13:21|[Kyle Mengso] saw [Gu Weijun] being so stubborn, so he confronted him directly.
0:13:21|0:13:22|In his eyes.
0:13:34|0:13:41|During the conversation, [Clay Montsou] picked up the tiger comic again, stood in front of [Gu Weijun], and looked at him with a mischievous childlike gaze.
0:13:42|0:13:45|[Gu Weijun] first agreed with [Clement So]'s statement.
0:13:52|0:13:56|[Klimonso] did not answer him, but instead smiled, with a hint of approval in his eyes.
0:13:57|0:14:0|President Wilson always mentions [Gu Weijun] and speaks highly of him all the time.
0:14:0|0:14:10|[Klimonso] believes that young people like [Gu Weijun] are...he then turned his head and asked for [Lu Zhengxiang]'s opinion, and [Lu Zhengxiang] gave him a positive answer.
0:14:22|0:14:25|[Klimonso] continues to change the subject and returns to his desk.
0:14:31|0:14:38|He took out an album from the drawer, which contained many other comics. He took them out one by one and showed them to [Gu Weijun].
0:14:38|0:14:44|In the comic, he is sometimes playing baseball, sometimes eating, and sometimes taking a walk with [Mei].
0:14:44|0:14:48|Apart from these daily routines, there are also some big-headed simple sketches, with all kinds of things.
0:14:53|0:15:1|[Gu Weijun] did not refuse. He took the tiger comic, signed his name and date in the lower right corner, and gave the comic to [Clementine].
0:15:1|0:15:9|Coming out of the conference hall late at night, [Gu Weijun] got on a horse and headed straight to the train station, where many people were gathered, all busy moving luggage.
0:15:9|0:15:15|After the carriage came to a slow stop, [Gu Weijun] leisurely stepped down. At that moment, a streetwalker enthusiastically threw herself onto him.
0:15:16|0:15:24|The female soldier Mei is heavily made up, wearing a black long skirt on the lower body, and a tight-fitting William Dao top on the upper body, showcasing her enchanting figure.
0:15:24|0:15:31|She hooked her arm around [Gu Weijun], trying to sell herself to him. [Gu Weijun] politely declined, but he kept pursuing her and followed her all the way to the lobby.
0:15:32|0:15:37|There are many streetwalkers here, they are so desperate to attract clients that they even resort to snatching others' handbags directly.
0:15:37|0:15:39|They saw [Gu Weijun] coming in and surrounded him.
0:15:39|0:15:42|[Gu Weijun] ignored them and continued walking forward.
0:15:49|0:15:52|[Gu Weijun] looked slightly stunned, glanced at him sideways, and then left.
0:15:52|0:15:57|At this moment, [Mei], the wife of [Xiao Kejian], is carrying a suitcase and following the crowd forward.
0:15:57|0:16:2|She put down her luggage and looked around, while [Gu Weijun] was also searching for her in the crowd.
0:16:2|0:16:15|The crowd gradually dispersed, and the two finally saw each other. [Mei] wanted to pick up her luggage and go to him, but the suitcase was too heavy for her to lift at once. [Xiao Kejian] quickly ran up to her, shook hands and greeted her, then hurriedly picked up the luggage.
0:16:22|0:16:24|[Gu Weijun] supported [Mei] and escorted her all the way home.
0:16:24|0:16:27|In the room, he lit the fireplace and sat down to make a fire.
0:16:27|0:16:29|[Mei] leaned against the head of the bed, looking at him with a worried expression on her face.
0:16:29|0:16:34|[Gu Weijun] saw his appearance, sighed, and then looked at the fire.
0:16:34|0:16:37|[Mei] continued to ask about the situation of [Xiao Kejian].
0:16:56|0:17:3|Mei's eyes were full of shock, disbelief written all over her face, tears swirling in her eyes. Soon she snapped out of it.
0:20:0|0:20:3|[Lu Zhengxiang] thought for a moment and found the statement reasonable.
0:20:3|0:20:5|He looked up and exchanged a glance with [Gu Weijun].
0:20:5|0:20:9|At the same time, [George] is pouring things out of the brown paper bag.
0:20:12|0:20:16|He repeatedly examined the jade in front of his eyes, his gaze almost obsessed.
0:20:16|0:20:18|He was so surprised that he couldn't speak.
0:20:24|0:20:29|After asking, he admired the jade again.
0:20:32|0:20:39|[Xiao Kejian] looked into his eyes, answered again, saw that he didn't understand, and then explained the meaning of the unicorn to him in French.
0:20:44|0:20:48|He held the jade in his hand, playing with it repeatedly, his eyes full of incredulity.
0:20:49|0:20:57|After a long pause, he finally recovered from his astonishment, put the unicorn into a paper bag, carefully sealed it, and then reverently returned it to [Xiao Kejian].
0:20:57|0:21:5|[Xiao Kejian] nodded and took it, his movements full of resentment. He grabbed the paper bag, opened his mouth, completely ignoring the hand of the Jade Clan hovering in mid-air.
0:21:5|0:21:12|He took out things one by one, stuffed them into the pockets of his vest, while Mei slowly pounded the jade, watching him tidy up quietly, her eyes busy following his movements.
0:21:12|0:21:16|[Xiao Kejian] hesitated for a moment before finally picking up the Qilin and putting it around his neck.
0:21:17|0:21:20|He gently touched the qilin on his neck, with deep affection.
0:21:20|0:21:23|Xiao Kejian lifted him up and added a sentence to [Mei].
0:21:24|0:21:29|He said this with a sweet smile, full of pride on his face, but quickly turned serious again.
0:21:29|0:21:35|Xiao Kejian turned around, opened the door and walked out. He stood at the doorway, took a deep breath, his eyes filled with a look of disgust.
0:21:35|0:21:39|He glanced around, then quickly walked out after confirming the direction.
0:21:39|0:21:42|He draped the clothes over his shoulders, then tore another piece off and spun it in the air.
0:21:42|0:21:47|[Xiao Kejian] bounced all the way, with brisk steps, even jumping onto someone else's bench.
0:21:47|0:21:50|She quickly ran out of here from above.
0:21:50|0:21:56|[Gu Weijun] had just finished work and returned home. As he hung up his hat and was about to go upstairs, he heard arguing coming from the kitchen.
0:22:0|0:22:6|Rao Na retorted, as he spoke, tearing the bread into small pieces and throwing them into the bowl, with a look of disdain on his face.
0:22:11|0:22:17|Mei stabbed her mother from the chair, slapped her daughter in the face, and the action shocked even herself.
0:22:17|0:22:23|Rao Na sneered at her mother, walked out of the kitchen, and [Gu Weijun] happened to walk by, the two of them looked at each other for a moment.
0:22:23|0:22:24|He paused for a moment.
0:22:27|0:22:35|The girl nodded, [Gu Weijun] said thank you, turned and left, leaving the one with her head down, then glanced at her mother before leaving proudly.
0:22:35|0:22:41|His mother rubbed her hands, full of regret, and sat down on a stool, looking self-reproachful, with tears swirling in her eyes.
0:22:41|0:22:44|Upstairs, [Gu Weijun] sat at the table, with a pile of open files spread out on the table.
0:22:45|0:22:47|He supported his head with his hand, his face full of distress.
0:22:47|0:22:52|At this moment, Nana's mother walked in with coffee and snacks, and [Gu Weijun] quickly stood up to thank her.
0:22:52|0:22:55|As he was about to leave, [Gu Weijun] called him back and whispered.
0:23:3|0:23:19|[Gou Weijun] had a sincere expression and caring words, but Nai's mother's expression turned serious. She walked towards [Gou Weijun], staring at him intently. Seeing her so puzzled, [Gou Weijun] heard the woman angrily saying she couldn't accept such charity and demanded an apology from [Gou Weijun].
0:23:20|0:23:24|Mei's eyes were fierce, as if there were flames burning in them.
0:23:24|0:23:32|[Gu Weijun] was incredulous when he heard this, he put down the newspaper, took off his glasses, and looked at [Lan Na]'s mother in a searching manner, his eyes full of confusion and puzzlement.
0:23:33|0:23:39|At this moment, [Mei] strode into the study with an imposing manner, glared at her mother, and went straight to the refreshments.
0:23:39|0:23:43|She took all the food from the tray and deliberately ate it in front of her mother.
0:23:43|0:23:48|The mother was furious and stormed out, while [Mei] remained indifferent.
0:23:48|0:23:52|She casually threw the snacks on the sofa, but soon began to gasp loudly.
0:23:52|0:23:55|[Gu Weijun] hesitated to speak, then let out a long sigh.
0:24:1|0:24:10|[Rang Na] heard this and cried even louder, [Gu Weijun] helplessly put on his glasses to start working, but was startled by the loud crying.
0:24:10|0:24:16|[Gu Weijun] finally decided to go and comfort [Rang Na], he propped up his body and slowly walked towards him, carefully calling out to him.
0:24:23|0:24:26|[Gu Weijun] ultimately chose to apologize, he said to [Rang Na].
0:24:28|0:24:44|[Ren Na]'s emotions became even more shattered. He cried out loudly, even wanting to curse this war. In his eyes, [Gu Weijun] stepped forward again, explaining that he truly wanted to help them. He looked at [Ren Na] with great sincerity, his eyes full of care.
0:24:44|0:24:48|Let Na was moved by Gu Weijun's good deed and eventually forgave him.
0:24:48|0:24:54|The girl sobbed on his shoulder, and [Gu Weijun] remained still, allowing her to vent her emotions.
0:24:54|0:25:1|[Xiao Kejian] rushed home from the police station and is now squatting on the ground, sorting out the luggage brought by his wife.
0:25:1|0:25:8|In the photo, there are two people, the latest newspapers, and a copy of the New Youth magazine, with two large boxes full of explanatory books.
0:25:8|0:25:12|[Xiao Kejian] is ecstatic, flipping through the documents excitedly, with a gleam in his eyes.
0:25:13|0:25:19|[Mei] quietly sat by the bed, looking at her husband with gentle and contented eyes.
0:25:31|0:25:37|Xiao Kejian picked up a stack of newspapers and started reading. Mei couldn't help but smile when she saw how engrossed he was.
0:26:1|0:26:5|[Mei] said nothing, she got up and walked to her husband's side, covering him with a shawl.
0:26:5|0:26:9|[Xiao Kejian] saw a photo in the stack of books, and his eyes lit up.
0:26:28|0:26:35|[Xiao Kejian] quickly flipped to the back to look, her eyes shining brightly, she sighed.
0:26:42|0:26:48|Xiao Kejian choked up for a moment, then sighed deeply after a long time.
0:26:48|0:26:52|The two fathers continued to bow their heads and look at the photos.
0:26:52|0:26:57|Xiao Kejian took off the shawl covering Mei's shoulders, his eyes full of heartache.
0:27:9|0:27:19|[Mei] looked at her husband, [Xiao Kejian] embraced him, the two hugged each other, expressing their love through actions. In his arms, [Mei] smiled sweetly and beautifully.
0:27:19|0:27:29|At noon on the second day, the Chinese delegation was waiting for lunch at the table. Two waiters placed plates in front of each person and then left. The lunch consisted of foie gras and a glass of fruit juice.
0:27:29|0:27:40|This foie gras, although large, is of poor quality. The orange color doesn't look fresh, and the chef fried it too long. Everyone finds it very difficult to cut, and it takes a lot of effort to finally cut a piece.
0:27:40|0:27:48|At this moment, Secretary Ye walked up to [Lu Zhengxiang] and opened the file in his hand to show him, then proceeded to report the situation to him.
0:27:59|0:28:5|[Lv Zhengxiang] went to look at the clock, it was already 2 o'clock in the afternoon.
0:28:37|0:28:43|After speaking, [Lu Zhengxiang] wiped his mouth and got up to leave, leaving everyone powerless, only able to watch him leave.
0:28:43|0:28:53|Shi Zhaoji put down his utensils at this moment, took off the napkin expressionlessly, and walked out of the restaurant. Wei Chenzu followed closely behind. For a moment, the vast restaurant was left with only [Gu Weijun] and Wang Zhengting.
0:28:53|0:29:0|[Gu Weijun] calmly ate his meal, unaffected by these few people. Wang Zhengting kept coldly smiling at them, then snorted.
0:29:0|0:29:5|Wang Zhengting concealed his temper towards these people, smiling as he stood up and looked towards [Gu Weijun].
0:29:28|0:29:35|The poet is getting ready for the meeting, and one by one, everyone walks into the meeting room. [Gu Weijun] is dressed in a suit and looks very eye-catching in the crowd.
0:29:35|0:29:44|At this moment, a person took out a pocket watch to check the time, accidentally dropping it on the ground when putting it back in the pocket. The person, however, proudly did not notice that the pocket watch was picked up by someone else.
0:29:45|0:29:55|In the venue, Chris Mengso is sitting in the middle of the stage, with the other members sitting on either side of him. He lightly taps a hammer to get everyone's attention, and then he speaks, inviting the Japanese representative, Kino Fukami, to speak.
0:30:1|0:30:11|Mei and Xiao Kejian nodded to each other, then got up and walked towards the stage. As they passed by the presidium, Mei bowed to Xiao Kejian before finally standing in their positions.
0:30:11|0:30:17|Mei slowly opened the speech script, reached into his pocket to search for something, but found it empty, failing to touch what he was looking for.
0:30:18|0:30:23|Mu Yeshen's expression changed drastically, and he quickly opened his clothes to search, but found nothing on both sides.
0:30:23|0:30:28|He frantically searched his body, regardless of his image, with a look of impatience, but still couldn't find it.
0:30:28|0:30:32|At this point, everyone was getting impatient and whispering below.
0:30:36|0:30:43|Recalling where things were lost, [Xiao Kejian] was getting impatient. He heavily knocked on the consciousness bell, reminding him to speak up quickly.
0:30:43|0:30:46|[Lv Zhengxiang] finally stopped and slowly spoke.
0:30:46|0:30:56|Regarding the Shandong issue, the Japanese government and the Chinese government have already signed 21 articles, so there is no need to discuss it during this visit. He appeared arrogant and self-righteous, showing no signs of guilt when he spoke.
0:30:58|0:31:5|[Lv Zhengxiang] spoke, his eyes constantly searching for confirmation on everyone's faces, as if trying to strengthen the validity of his argument.
0:31:5|0:31:6|[Xiao Kejian] questioned him,
0:31:9|0:31:12|[Liu Zhengxiang] shook his head to deny his own statement.
0:31:12|0:31:13|He continued to say,
0:31:28|0:31:36|[Gu Weijun] sat in the audience with a furrowed brow, [Wang Zhengting] also looked furious, they stared straight at [Mu Yeshenxian], their eyes filled with cold light.
0:31:36|0:31:43|Contrastingly, [Xiao Kejian] appeared extremely arrogant, with his mouth stretched to his ears and eyes full of contempt and provocation towards China.
0:31:43|0:31:49|Former Japanese Prime Minister Nishikuni Yoko praised him for his speech, his eyes full of approval for the content of his speech.
0:31:51|0:32:0|After Mu Yeshen finished speaking, he bowed to Klimt again, then pretended to walk off the stage. Klimt announced the invitation for the Chinese representative to come forward and speak.
0:32:0|0:32:8|[Gu Weijun] strode confidently to the lectern, wearing a long and wide gown. As he stood tall and straight, the translator followed closely beside him, standing by his side.
0:32:8|0:32:12|[Gu Weijun] placed the speech manuscript on the table, his eyes scanning the room, exuding a sense of urgency and deterrence.
0:32:41|0:32:44|Mu Yeshen slammed the table and shouted.
0:32:49|0:32:52|In addition, he also cursed [Gu Weijun] for being extremely shameless.
0:32:52|0:32:56|Mu Yeshenxian's expression was fierce, like an angry monster coming to life.
0:32:57|0:33:2|The crowd around all started to laugh, even the people on the podium were smiling without saying a word.
0:33:2|0:33:8|In the venue, everyone was whispering about this matter for a moment, and Klimt gently tapped a hammer to quiet everyone down.
0:33:54|0:34:4|Speak, [Gu Weijun] with light lips, looked at Mu Ye Shen Xian with a judgmental gaze. As soon as these words were spoken, everyone exchanged opinions. At this moment, British Prime Minister Lloyd George quietly said to Wilson.
0:34:4|0:34:7|[Gu Weijun] is a wise mouse, and Wilson agrees.
0:34:40|0:34:46|[Gu Weijun] looked determined, applause started to fill the room, more and more people clapping, the applause growing louder and more enthusiastic.
0:34:46|0:34:51|Lohr [George] highly appreciates that Gu Weijun is a true Chinese man who has cut off his queue.
0:34:58|0:35:1|Both of them looked at [Gu Weijun] with affirmation and admiration in their eyes.
0:36:44|0:36:48|Wilson took the lead in getting up, with a smile on his face and an excited expression.
0:36:48|0:36:52|Clement also applauded him, with a look of expectedness on his face.
0:36:52|0:36:55|They stood up and walked towards [Gu Weijun], surrounding him in the middle and shaking hands with him in salute.
0:36:59|0:37:5|After the meeting, a large group of reporters waited to interview [Gu Weijun], but he only suggested that the reporters go visit the Hua Gong Cemetery.
0:37:9|0:37:16|The next day, [Gu Weijun] rode a carriage home. It was a beautiful estate with lush vegetation, full of vitality.
0:37:16|0:37:21|The carriage stopped in the yard, [Gu Weijun] got off the car and let the child run over to greet.
0:37:24|0:37:30|[Gu Weijun] bid her farewell politely and ran towards the room with a smile on her face, full of spirit and confidence.
0:37:30|0:37:40|Lingna watched as [Gu Weijun] entered the house, with a constant smile on her lips and a gentle expression on her face. She stood still until she could no longer see her, her eyes filled with love for [Gu Weijun], revealing her girlish thoughts without reservation.
0:37:41|0:37:47|In the room, [Gu Weijun] picked up the letter on the table and opened it. There were no words on the letter, only two cute and playful drawings.
0:37:47|0:37:55|In the painting, a pig is depicted in human form, wearing a top hat and a suit, gently greeting two children, who are also eager to hug him.
0:37:55|0:38:3|In another painting, there are three little pigs, with the big pig leading the way and the two little pigs following closely behind, all happily strolling through the grass.
0:38:3|0:38:7|[Gu Weijun] smiled gently, his lips curling upwards, carefully placing the painting into the bookshelf.
0:38:8|0:38:13|Seeing Mei walk in with the coffee, Xiao Kejian couldn't help but sigh at how happy he looked, noting that it was the first time he had seen him so cheerful.
0:38:16|0:38:20|Let Na hand the coffee to [Gu Weijun], then playfully snatch the painting and look at it.
0:38:31|0:38:34|Speaks softly with a lot of patience.
0:38:34|0:38:41|Nan couldn't help but sigh as [Gu Weijun] paced around the room with his coffee, while Na stood quietly watching him.
0:38:45|0:38:49|Nana heard that [Gu Weijun] had just lost his wife before coming to France.
0:39:1|0:39:3|Have [Mei] walk excitedly to the table immediately.
0:39:14|0:39:19|Disappointed, [Mei] walked away, while [Xiao Kejian] picked up the letter and read it again in silence for a moment.
0:39:25|0:39:28|After speaking, without waiting for [Gu Weijun] to react, he happily ran out of the room.
0:39:29|0:39:46|[Gu Weijun] heard this with a pensive expression, slightly stunned, he put down his glasses and walked towards the door in big strides. Standing here, he looked outside and saw [Na] standing on the stairs, holding the railing and smiling shyly. Reluctantly, he slowly walked up step by step, his eyes always looking in the direction of [Gu Weijun].
0:39:46|0:39:49|But the smile on the girl's face didn't last long and gradually disappeared.
0:39:50|0:39:58|For some reason, [Mei] looked consistently despondent and frustrated, with the corners of her mouth that had just turned upwards now drooping down.
0:39:58|0:40:6|She hung her head in despair, looking completely different from before, her expression becoming increasingly sad as she slowly leaned down with her hand resting on the armrest.
0:40:6|0:40:13|In the living room, [Mei]'s mother was sitting on the sofa, reading a book attentively. She would occasionally pick up her glasses and carefully read the contents of the book.
0:40:17|0:40:21|Mei nodded in response and then walked in from outside.
0:40:21|0:40:25|Seeing her daughter approaching, [Mei] made her mother [Xiao Kejian] put down the book and look at her with great seriousness.
0:40:30|0:40:34|Make the mother glare angrily from a distance, looking very angry, and then give a disdainful smile.
0:40:45|0:40:58|He turned and walked away, leaving the mother unable to argue back. He picked up a book to read, but her gaze was all on her daughter. Her eyes showed a mix of emotions, with worry and anger. She sighed heavily, dejectedly put down the book, and furrowed her brow.
0:41:27|0:41:31|After exchanging pleasantries, the two sat down. [Gu Weijun] looked at the various tableware on the side.
0:41:38|0:41:40|[Gu Weijun] cast a look of doubt.
0:41:42|0:41:43|Wei Lianshi followed closely.
0:41:45|0:41:49|[Gu Weijun] pondered for a moment, then Wei Lianshi continued.
0:41:53|0:41:57|After speaking, he looked towards the door and saw [Lu Zhengxiang] swaggering in from outside.
0:42:6|0:42:10|He felt honored to have him there, and then sat down across from [Gu Weijun].
0:42:31|0:42:36|William felt a little guilty. He didn't say anything, awkwardly smiled, and raised his glass to drink.
0:42:36|0:42:38|Mei put down the wine glass just in time, with a deep and dangerous look in her eyes.
0:42:38|0:42:41|He paused for a moment, organized his thoughts, and slowly began to speak.
0:42:54|0:43:2|[Mei] was also deeply involved, looking serious. This was in stark contrast to the arrogant and rude expression she had at the cannibal feast that day, yet one could still detect a hint of calculation in her eyes.
0:43:12|0:43:16|William looks relaxed, showing a demeanor of always considering China's interests.
0:43:18|0:43:20|[Gu Weijun] stared at Williams with a serious expression.
0:43:21|0:43:25|The waiter brought out the steak and French baked scallops.
0:43:25|0:43:29|[Gu Weijun] picked up the knife and fork to prepare for the meal, while calmly starting to refute.
0:43:29|0:43:33|He made an analogy, describing the matter as a policeman finding a wallet.
0:43:38|0:43:41|[Gu Weijun] raised his eyes and looked mischievously at the two of them.
0:43:42|0:43:49|Wei Lianshi couldn't hold back his frustration on his face, wanting to argue but feeling guilty inside. His eyes were sunken, his beard trembling with anger, and his eyebrows furrowed tightly.
0:43:49|0:43:55|[Gu Weijun] ignored the two of them, casually took a sip of wine from the glass, and started to taste the scallops.
0:43:55|0:44:4|He picked up a piece of scallop meat from the white sauce and cheese and put it into his mouth. Seeing his plan exposed, [Mei] racked his brains for a new excuse.
0:44:4|0:44:10|[Mei] saw him so calm, still able to eat without distraction, and couldn't help but retort in exasperation.
0:44:14|0:44:18|[Gu Weijun] seemed to be ignoring him, continuing to eat his meal as if nothing had happened.
0:44:18|0:44:21|[Mei] is becoming increasingly angry, her expression starting to become more and more fierce.
0:44:23|0:44:30|[Gu Weijun] looked disheveled, he finished the last sip of wine, thanked with a smile, and then got up and left.
0:44:47|0:44:50|At the same time, the Beijing government also sent an urgent training notice to [Lu Zhengxiang].
0:44:58|0:45:13|The Japanese government has lodged a protest with Beijing, accusing the Chinese government of violating the mutually agreed upon agreement at the association, and demanding the removal of [Gu Weijun]'s representative status.
0:45:47|0:45:51|[Xiao Kejian]'s words made the other three present fall silent.
0:45:51|0:45:56|He handed the documents to [Wang Zhengting], who looked through them one by one, his expression growing increasingly serious.
0:45:56|0:46:3|He passed the documents to [Xiao Kejian], who, after reading them, showed a slight relaxation in his expression.
0:46:53|0:46:56|[Lv Zhengxiang] spoke with a resolute tone and a determined gaze.
0:46:57|0:47:2|[Gu Weijun] pushed open the door with a file in hand, saw everyone gathered in the room, and for a moment didn't know what to say.
0:47:4|0:47:7|The three of them awkwardly smiled and got up to leave.
0:47:7|0:47:10|[Gu Weijun] leaned against the wall, looking a bit lost.
0:47:10|0:47:14|After sending them out, [Gu Weijun] quickly handed the documents in his hand to [Lu Zhengxiang].
0:47:17|0:47:21|Mrs. Pei Debofei, wife of [Lu Zhengxiang], walked out of the bedroom with a smile as beautiful as a night flower.
0:47:27|0:47:32|She helped her husband sit on the sofa, with [Lu Zhengxiang] maintaining a serious expression on his face, which was now filled with a smile.
0:47:44|0:47:46|[Lv Zhengxiang] lightly patted his wife, trying to calm her down.
0:47:53|0:47:54|He continued.
0:47:57|0:48:0|[Lu Zhengxiang] nodded heavily, he also thought so.
0:48:4|0:48:6|Go ahead, the two of them walked out together.
0:48:7|0:48:13|On the other side, [Mei] just woke up from her sleep and found that [Xiao Kejian] was not there. She got up and started looking for him.
0:48:13|0:48:17|[Xiao Kejian] is at the window organizing documents, looking deeply serious and earnest.
0:48:17|0:48:26|Seeing his wife wake up, a smile lit up his face, and in [Mei]'s eyes, there was unexpected tenderness.
0:48:26|0:48:30|After speaking, she continued with her actions, and [Mei] gave a playful smile.
0:48:35|0:48:38|[Mei] put on her clothes and walked into the room with a smile.
0:48:38|0:48:42|She moved a stool and stood on it, reaching for the food placed on top of the wardrobe.
0:48:42|0:48:47|She picked up a can of coffee and was about to get some bread, but she touched something strange in the paper bag.
0:48:47|0:48:51|She paused for a moment, quickly took it down and opened it, only to find a handgun inside.
0:48:51|0:48:56|[Mei] took out the gun and checked it repeatedly, her breathing becoming rapid, her eyes filled with fear.
0:48:56|0:48:59|She tightly gripped the gun and got off the chair in a panic.
0:48:59|0:49:9|Mei walked quickly towards [Xiao Kejian], but slowed down when she reached the door, hesitated for a moment, and still walked over. She leaned against the door, not saying a word.
0:49:9|0:49:15|[Xiao Kejian] heard his wife approaching, paused in his actions, with a hint of guilt on his face, slowly looked up at her.
0:49:15|0:49:20|Mei was seen holding a gun, her face full of fear, her hair disheveled, and panic in her eyes.
0:49:20|0:49:29|[Xiao Kejian] knew that he had been found out, so he lowered his head and remained silent. [Mei] was trembling all over, her breathing irregular, her large eyes filled with disbelief.
0:49:29|0:49:35|[Xiao Kejian] dare not look directly at him, his eyes evasive and dodging, while [Mei] tries hard to suppress her emotions and speaks up to inquire.
0:49:47|0:49:54|[Xiao Kejian] avoided eye contact, not saying a word for a long time. She walked slowly towards her wife and took the gun from her.
0:49:57|0:50:3|[Mei], feeling relieved all of a sudden, couldn't stop her tears from flowing. She hugged her husband tightly and cried out.
0:50:4|0:50:4|Although she sounded confident, her eyes were still filled with worry and doubt. 
0:50:24|0:50:35|At the same time, an explosion occurred at the Japanese delegation's residence, with flames shooting out of the windows. The building was quickly filled with thick smoke, ambulances were urgently transporting the injured downstairs, and the fire brigade was busy extinguishing the fire.
0:50:35|0:50:44|Mu Yeshen and [Xiao Kejian] stood awkwardly downstairs, Mu Yeshen nodded and bowed to report to [Xiao Kejian], speculating that either the Koreans or the Chinese were behind this.
0:50:45|0:50:47|[The Four Lords of the West] gritted his teeth and said angrily.
0:50:57|0:51:11|On February 20, 1912, several guns were quietly extended from the railing next to the Palace of Versailles. [Clyde Monso] walked out of the main gate with a smile on his face, completely unaware of the danger. Just as he was about to board the carriage, his gaze suddenly focused, as if he had noticed something unusual.
0:51:11|0:51:20|But it was too late, the sniper pulled the trigger, the bullet passed through [Chris Mengeso]'s right shoulder and arm, he was shot a total of six times, but none hit any vital organs.
0:51:24|0:51:27|[Kyle Mengso] clutched his wound and fell to the ground in pain.
0:52:14|0:52:21|[Gu Weijun] ignored [Wang Zhengting]'s sarcastic remarks, opened the door and left. But he stopped at the doorway, reminding with a smile that was not quite a smile.
0:52:26|0:52:30|[Gu Weijun] pushed the door shut with a bang, his smile disappearing instantly.
0:52:30|0:52:33|He rode back to the manor in a carriage, where Mei had been waiting for him.
0:52:45|0:52:58|[Gu Weijun] strode towards the room, his face full of panic. He pushed open the door and headed upstairs. When he reached the middle of the stairs, he suddenly stopped, turned around, and called for the door to be locked. [Gu Weijun] then hurried to the room on the second floor.
0:53:1|0:53:9|In the room, [Xiao Kejian] is lying on the sofa. [Mei] has just finished applying medicine for him and is wiping the sweat beads on his forehead with a towel, looking worried.
0:53:9|0:53:13|Gu Weijun did not come in. He stood at the door and peeked inside through the crack.
0:53:13|0:53:20|After a while, he closed the door and left from here. [Mei] heard the noise and quickly put down the towel to chase after him.
0:53:20|0:53:26|Gu Weijun stormed off in anger, striding through the corridor with a dark expression on his face, while Mei shouted after him.
0:53:36|0:53:40|[Mei] was questioned and couldn't speak for a moment, looking somewhat aggrieved leaning against the door.
0:53:40|0:53:43|Faced with the anger of [Gu Weijun], she was also a little afraid.
0:54:15|0:54:20|[Gu Weijun] turned and left, [Mei] looked at him with a helpless expression as he went downstairs, then returned to the room.
0:54:20|0:54:25|He closed the door and carefully walked to [Xiao Kejian]'s side, squatting down to take care of him.
0:54:25|0:54:34|[Xiao Kejian] had a pale face, lips devoid of any color, with thick bandages wrapped around his neck and arms, yet blood still seeped through to the surface.
0:54:34|0:54:40|He is resting with his eyes closed at the moment, with dark circles under his eyes, showing signs of exhaustion in [Mei]'s words.
0:54:40|0:54:44|He adjusted his position slightly, but groaned in pain. [Mei] leaned over to his ear and spoke to him.
0:54:48|0:54:58|The severe injury made [Xiao Kejian] sleep very restlessly. She started coughing violently, causing her wound to be pulled, and she winced in pain. [Lu Zhengxiang] comfortingly stroked her head, his eyes filled with unrelenting concern.
0:54:58|0:55:4|She tried hard to suppress the sadness, but the series of events made her feel helpless and heartbroken.
0:55:4|0:55:9|A few days later, [Xiao Kejian]'s injuries gradually recovered, but the wound on his arm was not healing properly.
0:55:9|0:55:12|At this moment, she is taking a walk in the estate with her wife and [Gu Weijun].
0:55:13|0:55:18|The lawn of the manor was as soft as a carpet, allowing Mei to search for mushrooms here while carrying a basket.
0:55:18|0:55:28|She parted the grass and saw two mushrooms growing closely together, looking very fresh. She picked them and put them in the basket, which was filled with her harvest of the day.
0:55:28|0:55:31|She looked up and saw three people walking, a slight smile playing on her lips. 
0:55:41|0:55:49|In the distance, [Gu Weijun] had his hand on [Xiao Kejian]'s back. He was wearing a suit today, with his hair casually loose, a departure from his usual serious demeanor.
0:55:49|0:55:54|He walked and chatted with [Xiao Kejian], and when they disagreed, they stopped to discuss.
0:55:54|0:55:58|Seeing such a vivid [Gu Weijun], Rana's smile grew even wider.
0:55:58|0:56:0|Jenna smiled knowingly without [Mei] noticing.
0:56:10|0:56:25|[Mei] waved and greeted [Nana], bouncing over to her, while [Gu Weijun] and [Xiao Kejian] continued their walk. [Nana] still gazed lovingly at her crush, as [Mei] walked over and squatted next to him, chatting with him. He looked at the basket full of mushrooms and couldn't help but sigh.
0:56:27|0:56:35|[Mei] didn't answer, saying she envied the three of them. They were like siblings, and longing filled his eyes.
0:56:36|0:56:40|They grew up together since childhood, which made [Nana] even more envious.
0:57:17|0:57:33|[Gu Weijun] turned his back in anger, and [Xiao Kejian] fell silent.
0:57:33|0:57:41|With these words, [Gu Weijun] turned and left, leaving [Xiao Kejian] lost in thought. Meanwhile, [Rang Na] was consulting [Mei] on how to say "I love you" in Chinese.
0:57:56|0:58:2|Approaching [Xiao Kejian] and [Gu Weijun], Mei couldn't help but smile slightly when she heard the two of them chatting, and she walked towards them.
0:58:13|0:58:19|In the Palace of Versailles, [Lu Zhengxiang] is pacing by the window, and Eric immediately reports that the assassin has been caught.
0:58:19|0:58:20|[Lv Zhengxiang] hurriedly asked:
0:58:21|0:58:22|Eric said:
0:58:23|0:58:27|Kerry Mengso was furious and shouted in confusion, not understanding why the assassin did this.
0:58:29|0:58:33|The assassin is for justice, he sympathizes with China and all the weak countries.
0:58:33|0:58:36|Kerry Mengso was even more angry, waving his cane and shouting.
0:58:43|0:58:47|[Gu Weijun] walked into the hall holding a bouquet of flowers, where he saw Chris Manso.
0:58:49|0:58:55|The two shook hands in a friendly manner, with Chris Mengso taking the flowers and inviting him to sit down.
0:58:55|0:59:4|Kerry Mengsuo recounted the information reported by [Gu Weijun] to Mei, admitting that if the news had come any later, he might have suspected it was [Gu Weijun]'s doing.
0:59:4|0:59:8|[Gou Weijun] then joked with him with a smile.
0:59:11|0:59:15|Kerry Meng gave a hearty laugh and once again thanked [Gu Weijun] for coming to visit him.
0:59:30|0:59:31|[Gou Weijun] smiled and said.
0:59:34|0:59:36|But Klimt said.
0:59:43|0:59:44|Klimt said.
0:59:46|0:59:48|But they had no choice.
0:59:51|0:59:53|[Gu Weijun] reminded Mei of the dream.
1:0:5|1:0:11|Klimt nodded without saying a word, then turned and walked to the chair to sit down, smiling as he admired [Gu Weijun], who was very good at debating.
1:0:12|1:0:23|Kerry Mengso suggested that the proposal of the U.S. President is very similar to his own, and asked if they had discussed it. [Gu Weijun] sat down on the sofa in the tent and, facing Kerry Mengso's question, he simply said.
1:0:27|1:0:33|[Gu Weijun]'s high emotional intelligence response made the admiration on Kremon's face even more pronounced.
1:0:54|1:1:0|[Gu Weijun] stood up, bowed slightly to [Clement], and then packed up to leave.
1:1:0|1:1:4|Klimt motioned for Alec to go and see off, [Gu Weijun] nodded slightly at him and walked slowly out of the gate.
1:1:5|1:1:13|In the following meeting, the representatives of several countries, including France and England, were almost going crazy. [George] pointed at the map, arguing fiercely with [Mei] as if their lives were at stake.
1:1:13|1:1:21|Klimt was just smoking a pipe, calmly listening to the scholar speak. In contrast, Wilson had a detached look on his face, with a slight smile at the corner of his mouth, enjoying the farce.
1:1:23|1:1:29|At the long table in the meeting room, representatives from several countries had different expressions, but the color of greed was still evident in everyone's eyes. 
1:1:29|1:1:44|Clement sits in the front row, looking relatively calm. Lohe [George] and a representative of a country stand arguing, while Wilson watches intently. Orlando is deep in thought, and Muye Shenxian and several other representatives from different countries are engaged in a more heated debate, all gesturing to refute each other's opinions.
1:1:52|1:2:5|At the end of the meeting, Italy's ambition to dominate the Mediterranean was fiercely criticized by the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. The Italian delegation, seeing that they could not gain any benefits, angrily left the meeting and completely withdrew from the conference on April 24, 1919.
1:2:16|1:2:20|The leaders of England and France immediately supported Japan.
1:2:20|1:2:23|President Wilson hesitated.
1:2:23|1:2:32|After weighing the interests of the United States in Asia repeatedly, he finally sacrificed China and supported Japan.
1:2:57|1:3:6|Japan's attempt to annex Shandong at the Versailles Conference is about to succeed!
1:3:24|1:3:57|In the Palace of Versailles, [Clement Soames] and [George] are looking outwards. [Clement Soames] looks at the protesters in the distance and remarks that she has never noticed so many Chinese people in Paris. George takes out his pipe and tells [Clement Soames] that if she were to count, she would realize that all the Chinese people in France are here, and when she returns to England, she will see how many Chinese people there are there. [Clement Soames] jokes about the Chinese people welcoming her at the train station. George, however, says that out of the three of them, only the President will probably receive flowers from the Chinese people. They say this is for peace.
1:4:8|1:4:13|Kerry Mengso and Laohe [George] hide in the restaurant, picking up the wine on the table and continue chatting.
1:4:13|1:4:15|They listened to the protests downstairs.
1:4:20|1:4:24|[Wilson] was also looking out the window and overheard the conversation between the two.
1:4:26|1:4:28|Downstairs, [Xiao Kejian] passionately delivers a speech.
1:4:28|1:4:31|Chinese compatriots are holding banners actively responding.
1:5:14|1:5:21|In the hall, [Klein Mengsu] sat on the sofa in the middle, with [Lawrence George Wilson], [Lu Zhengxiang], and [Gu Weijun] sitting on either side.
1:5:21|1:5:26|[Kelin Mengsu] presided over the meeting, and he first invited [Wilson] to speak on behalf.
1:5:26|1:5:28|[Wilson] slowly begins to speak.
1:5:55|1:5:59|Mei's brows furrowed tighter and tighter, her eyes flashing with uncontrollable anger, her expression solemn.
1:5:59|1:6:8|[Lu Zhengxiang] appeared calm on the surface, but he kept tapping the ground with his cane, indicating inner turmoil. The two exchanged glances from time to time, sharing their thoughts.
1:6:8|1:6:13|Wilson read more and more quietly as he reached the end, with a depressed mood in his eyes. After finishing reading, he closed the file.
1:6:29|1:6:39|[Lu Zhengxiang] looked up at Wilson upon hearing these words, then lowered his gaze in contemplation for a long time. He tightly gripped his cane, let out a deep sigh, and replied that this plan would greatly disappoint the Chinese people.
1:6:39|1:6:41|[Gu Weijun] then continued.
1:6:48|1:7:5|The hall fell silent, with no one speaking for a moment. [George], who had been smoking all along, broke the silence and asked [Lu Zhengxiang] and [Mei] in a deliberate manner, whether they preferred the solution proposed by the Chinese government and Japan, including the 21 demands, or the one just put forward by the American president.
1:7:5|1:7:11|[George] looked disdainful, holding a pipe in his mouth, leaning back on the sofa, arrogantly scanning the two of them.
1:7:11|1:7:19|His tone carried a hint of threat, although it was a question, it sounded more like an interrogation. After speaking, he took a deep drag of his cigarette and leaned back.
1:7:19|1:7:21|[Gu Weijun] stated firmly.
1:7:40|1:7:44|Although Wilson sounded confident, [Gu Weijun] still looked doubtful in his eyes.
1:7:48|1:7:57|But in his view, when the time came, he blew a whistle, clearly indicating that [Gu Weijun] had long seen through the tricks of the United States.
1:8:5|1:8:14|[Gu Weijun] retorted, reminding the audience to be cautious. Wilson nodded, and Clemens and [George] gestured with their eyes for him to continue.
1:8:28|1:8:35|[Gu Weijun] paused for a moment, then continued to explain the consequences. By then, they could only regret it.
1:8:50|1:8:53|When the conversation didn't go well, [Lu Zhengxiang] stood up and left first, followed closely by [Gu Weijun].
1:8:54|1:9:0|Outside the Palace of Versailles, the French police received orders to launch an attack on the Chinese protesters.
1:9:0|1:9:6|They rode on horses, holding sticks in their hands, charging towards the crowd from different directions, wooden signs were knocked to the ground and broken into two halves. 
1:9:6|1:9:12|Everyone fought back against the security guards with the tools at hand, but the security guards were well-equipped and unaffected.
1:9:12|1:9:16|They used batons and pepper spray to strike the crowd, being ruthless and targeting vital points.
1:9:16|1:9:18|No one retreats, even so.
1:9:18|1:9:22|In the crowd, someone tightly clings to Mei's legs, trying to pull the guard down.
1:9:23|1:9:26|Someone used a fragile wooden board as a shield, fiercely fighting back against the sticks.
1:9:26|1:9:32|The efforts made by the Chinese masses are like a bowl of chicken feed, with people being beaten to the point of bleeding and falling to the ground unable to get up.
1:9:32|1:9:36|But as one person falls, another rushes forward, no one is giving up.
1:9:36|1:9:41|The guards were surrounded by a large crowd and dared not get off the carriage, only using sticks to strike.
1:9:41|1:9:48|But this was not enough to defeat the Chinese people. The scene was a mess, with signs scattered on the ground, trampled haphazardly by hooves.
1:9:49|1:9:53|But the determination to recapture Qingdao has deeply rooted in the hearts of the Chinese people.
1:9:53|1:9:58|On the newspaper, the Shandong issue dominates the front page, with more and more people joining the march.
1:9:58|1:10:10|When the news of Germany transferring its interests in Shandong to Japan reached Beijing, the Chinese public was immediately plunged into a state of despair and anger.
1:10:13|1:10:24|On May 4th, the May Fourth Movement, an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal movement, broke out in China. The domestic voices were getting louder and louder, posing a greater challenge to the delegation.
1:10:26|1:10:31|At night, [Lu Zhengxiang] paces in the room when his assistant knocks on the door and enters.
1:10:31|1:10:35|[Lv Zhengxiang] looked at the letter with a serious expression, furrowing his brows.
1:10:35|1:10:43|After watching it, he crumpled the letter into a ball and sighed heavily.
1:10:43|1:10:49|[Gu Weijun] was not as excited as the other representatives, calmly flipping through the newspaper.
1:11:6|1:11:13|[Gu Weijun] suddenly looked up at the Wei Chen group, then calmly put away the newspaper and picked up the teacup.
1:11:44|1:11:46|The atmosphere in the room suddenly became tense.
1:11:46|1:11:50|Just then, [Lu Zhengxiang] walked over, and the group quickly got up to greet him.
1:11:50|1:11:56|[Lv Zhengxiang] sat down and waved to everyone to sit down. The four of them all looked at him, waiting for him to speak.
1:11:56|1:11:59|[Lv Zhengxiang] hesitated to speak, and Wei Chenzu couldn't hold back his temper.
1:12:17|1:12:21|[Gu Weijun] angrily pounded the table, while Wei Zhanzu helplessly leaned back.
1:12:31|1:12:38|[Gu Weijun] heard this and his face lit up with excitement. After some thought, he made up his mind to discuss it with [Lu Zhengxiang].
1:12:44|1:12:46|Outside, lightning flashed and thunder roared. The next morning, Mei and Xiao Kejian took a car to the Palace of Versailles.
1:13:9|1:13:19|In order to change the unfavorable situation facing China, the delegation had to endure humiliation, negotiate with the defeated parties, and make every effort to mediate diplomatically.
1:13:19|1:13:23|Here, [Gu Weijun] looks out the window with a heavy heart.
1:13:23|1:13:24|[Liu Zhengxiang] is also the same.
1:13:24|1:13:34|Although the plan to retain the signature is not ideal, it is currently the only way and perhaps the last resort.
1:13:49|1:13:53|The foreign powers rejected all the requests of the Chinese delegation.
1:13:58|1:14:3|After our diplomatic efforts failed, [Lu Zhengxiang] completely lost faith.
1:14:33|1:14:39|[Gu Weijun] was slightly stunned, with a blazing fire of anger in his eyes, he slammed the phone heavily on the table.
1:15:1|1:15:7|In front of the table, Jesus is nailed to the cross by his son, symbolizing redemption, [Mei] slowly swallows while facing him.
1:15:12|1:15:17|[Lu Zhengxiang] couldn't help but sob, while [Gu Weijun] leaned helplessly against the door frame, his eyes filled with sadness.
1:15:17|1:15:25|Pei Debofei pushed the door open at this moment, and saw her husband crying in front of Jesus, feeling extremely heartbroken. She looked at [Gu Weijun] with a face full of anger.
1:15:25|1:15:29|[Gu Weijun] walked towards the inner room, followed by [Pei Debofei], who closed the door behind him.
1:15:29|1:15:32|[Gu Weijun] stood in the room, the light in his eyes was about to go out.
1:15:33|1:15:41|[Pei Debofei] walked up to [Gu Weijun], angrily growling at him, asking him not to blame [Lu Zhengxiang] too much for this matter.
1:15:45|1:15:55|[Gu Weijun] slowly turned around, leaving behind two lines of tears. He bowed deeply to [Pei Debufei], then left. [Pei Debufei]'s anger turned into shock.
1:15:56|1:16:9|He looked at the back of [Gu Weijun] in disbelief, it was already midnight, the sky outside was covered with dark clouds, the clouds were low and moving quickly with the wind, casting a gloomy shadow over the whole of Paris.
1:16:9|1:16:20|[Gu Weijun] drove home, passing by the iconic buildings of France, the July Column and the Arc de Triomphe, but he couldn't appreciate them. The atmosphere became increasingly heavy, with a sense of oppressive darkness looming over the city.
1:16:21|1:16:29|The once shining sculpture now showed no beauty at all, as raindrops quietly fell and hit the dim streetlights, making the scene even more desolate.
1:16:29|1:16:37|[Gu Weijun] sat in the car with his eyes closed, his body swaying with the movement of the car, making a creaking sound. A flash of lightning and thunder woke him up, and the car happened to stop at that moment.
1:16:37|1:16:51|[Gu Weijun] glanced out the window, gestured for the driver to keep going. There, [Xiao Kejian] stood at his doorstep with workers and students holding banners, even in such heavy rain, their spirits were high. Seeing [Gu Weijun] return, they raised their arms and cheered.
1:17:9|1:17:13|[Gu Weijun] sighed lightly, straightened his bow tie and prepared to get off the car.
1:17:13|1:17:16|He looked determined, ready to face the crowd.
1:17:16|1:17:20|[Xiao Kejian] jumps down from the steps and stands next to the car door.
1:17:20|1:17:21|His face was haggard, but his eyes were bright.
1:17:21|1:17:21|The two looked at each other, with [Xiao Kejian] wearing an extremely serious expression.
1:18:19|1:18:31|The crowd was enraged, [Gu Weijun] was surrounded by them, being scolded and pointed at in the face, [Mei]'s mother was alarmed, looking down in fear, [Mei] at this moment also covered her mouth in disbelief, her pupils dilated.
1:18:31|1:18:43|She turned and ran, picked up a gun and quickly ran down the stairs without any hesitation. She ran to the edge of the crowd, fired a shot into the sky, and the restless crowd instantly quieted down. [Mei]'s mother was shocked to see this scene.
1:18:43|1:18:44|Nana continued to shout.
1:18:49|1:18:57|Whether it was the sincerity that moved the crowd or the gunshot that intimidated them, [Gu Weijun] finally managed to enter the room safely.
1:18:57|1:19:1|He was soaked all over, with his hair all falling in front of his forehead, looking very disheveled.
1:19:2|1:19:7|He stood firm, obviously not recovering from the previous siege.
1:19:7|1:19:12|[Gu Weijun] took off his coat, sat on the bed with force, stood with hands on hips on the side, his face full of anger.
1:19:12|1:19:17|He irritably loosened his tie and walked unsteadily to the sofa chair to lie down.
1:19:17|1:19:20|[Gu Weijun] closed his eyes, his face full of exhaustion and irritation.
1:19:21|1:19:31|He rested very uneasily, constantly adjusting his posture. Suddenly, he heard footsteps approaching, and he abruptly opened his eyes, only to see [Mei] walking towards him with coffee and snacks, her face full of concern.
1:19:31|1:19:36|He placed the tray on the table, sat next to [Gu Weijun], and held his hand to comfort him.
1:19:39|1:19:42|[Mei] is full of heartache.
1:19:45|1:19:51|[Gu Weijun] sat up, her words made herself feel relieved.
1:19:51|1:19:54|[Gu Weijun] finally smiled, and [Mei] also smiled slightly.
1:19:55|1:19:59|At this moment, [Mei]'s mother came in from outside and said excitedly.
1:20:1|1:20:4|Gu Weijun thanked [Mei] emotionally, said [Xiao Kejian]'s mother.
1:20:11|1:20:15|Let [Na] ran over and hugged her mother, and the mother and daughter finally reconciled at this moment.
1:20:16|1:20:21|It's another night, [Mei] walks down the stairs and heads towards the room at the end of the corridor.
1:20:21|1:20:24|[Xiao Kejian] is having a meeting here with a group of patriots.
1:20:24|1:20:29|He stood at the front, with a determined look, while the others sat below, listening attentively.
1:20:42|1:20:53|Suddenly, a loud thunderclap exploded in the sky, with lightning flashing on everyone's faces. Everyone appeared hesitant and fell into silence.
1:20:53|1:20:58|Upon reaching the door of the room, listening carefully to their conversation, everyone remained silent, with [Xiao Kejian] making a brief statement.
1:21:11|1:21:14|Desperately closes his eyes.
1:21:14|1:21:19|[Mei] quickly runs away from the room door, jumps onto a carriage and gallops through the rainy night.
1:21:19|1:21:22|The carriage drove out of the house, with [Mei] sitting on top, anxious.
1:21:22|1:21:26|At the same time, the federation has prepared the slips for the draw.
1:21:26|1:21:35|[Xiao Kejian] took a card first, opened it to check the result. [Mei] kept looking out the window, sweat beading on her forehead, praying for a quick arrival.
1:21:35|1:21:37|The carriage finally arrived at the destination, the home of [Gu Weijun].
1:21:38|1:21:42|Mei rushed out of the car before it even came to a stop, heading straight for the entrance.
1:21:42|1:21:51|He stumbled and staggered, almost falling several times, pushing the iron door back and forth without much force. However, the door was locked from the inside, and no matter how hard he pushed, it remained unmoved.
1:21:51|1:22:1|In his emotional state, [Mei] didn't climb up the steps to ring the bell. The heavy rain made it impossible for him to open his eyes for a moment. He shook the bell while peering inside through the crack of the door, hoping that the people inside could hear.
1:22:2|1:22:6|The loud bell woke up [Mei], she put on her clothes and ran downstairs.
1:22:6|1:22:11|[Mei] continues to shake the bell, the frequency getting faster and her mood becoming more anxious.
1:22:11|1:22:16|[Ranja] quickly ran to the gate, and [Mei] saw her coming, rushing to the opposite side of her.
1:22:27|1:22:32|[Mei] quickly stopped him from saying no, and got on the carriage again to leave. [Lana] watched him walk away, with a bewildered look on her face.
1:22:32|1:22:41|Raindrops fell on the ground, creating splashes, [Mei] sat in the car with a thoughtful expression, tightly closing her eyes and biting her lower lip, pondering what other options she had.
1:22:41|1:22:45|She looked out the window, her eyebrows furrowed and tears welling up in her eyes. 
1:22:45|1:22:49|At this moment, [Xiao Kejian] opens the note, with only one word written on it, "death".
1:22:50|1:22:54|He closed and then opened the note, but the situation was already set.
1:22:54|1:23:0|The rain washed over the glass, and Jiang [Mei]'s figure was blurred, but one could see his despair in a night.
1:23:0|1:23:8|[Mei] supported herself against the wall and ran to the meeting room brightly, but the lights were already out, the fire had burned out, and the house was empty.
1:23:9|1:23:20|[Mei] looked around the empty room, feeling lost. Suddenly, she noticed scattered notes on the table and hurried over. Each note had fresh handwriting, and there was one with the word "death" written on it.
1:23:20|1:23:26|Mei felt something was wrong and quickly ran back to the house she and Xiao Kejian had found, but the room was still silent.
1:23:26|1:23:32|She turned her head and saw a letter on the table. She quickly picked it up and read it. There were only four lines on the letter, but [Mei] read it for a long time.
1:23:46|1:23:49|[Mei]'s large eyes were instantly filled with despair.
1:23:49|1:23:53|She put down the letter and ran out, not feeling any pain even when her knees hit the table.
1:23:53|1:23:58|She ran down the stairs in an attempt to catch up with her husband, but he was long gone.
1:23:58|1:24:1|[Mei] leaned against the wall in despair, her emotions on the verge of collapse.
1:24:4|1:24:9|He leaned weakly against the wall, a mixture of tears and rain falling down. [Mei]
1:24:9|1:24:14|He sat on the steps, crying uncontrollably, his eyes filled with helplessness.
1:24:14|1:24:25|The pouring rain continued to echo his cries, but the violent shaking of his shoulders said it all. The tears had dried up, every gaze empty, like a stagnant pool of dead water, unable to stir up any ripples.
1:24:25|1:24:27|The torrential rain lasted all night and finally stopped in the early morning.
1:24:54|1:24:58|At that time, she rode a bicycle with [Mei], passing through the streets and alleys of Paris.
1:24:58|1:25:2|[Mei] is wearing a long skirt and a vest, with a straw hat on her head and two braids.
1:25:2|1:25:6|Xiao Kejian is wearing a shirt, with a vest over the clothes.
1:25:6|1:25:14|The two characters' clothing colors are similar, with [Gu Weijun] looking very compatible with the talented beauty, as if even the sunlight favors them, warmly shining on the two of them.
1:25:15|1:25:20|As if they were coated with a layer of golden light, [Mei] and [Xiao Kejian] chased each other along the Seine River, incredibly happy.
1:25:20|1:25:24|The memories came flooding back one by one, but the leading lady in each memory was [Mei].
1:25:24|1:25:32|Mei and Xiao Kejian, tired from riding their bikes, decided to lie down on the grass beneath the Eiffel Tower, facing each other with their eyes closed, quietly feeling the breeze and sunlight.
1:25:32|1:25:36|The sun was warm that day, with fluffy white clouds in the sky, it was a rare good weather. [Mei] and [Xiao Kejian] were enjoying the day.
1:25:36|1:25:41|[Xiao Kejian]'s memories of [Mei] are so vivid, indicating how reluctant he is to let go.
1:25:42|1:26:0|[Gu Weijun] immersed himself in the tranquility brought by playing the piano. With his eyes closed, his body swayed back and forth with the melody. In front of the laughing audience, he appeared surprisingly calm. Just knowing that he had to go through this moment, he was shocked and flustered, but at this moment he was extremely indifferent. As the sky gradually brightened, the music also reached its climax, and [Gu Weijun] became even more engrossed.
1:26:0|1:26:2|Behind him, the flames in the fireplace were roaring.
1:26:3|1:26:19|Versailles Palace gate has also been engulfed in raging flames, with flames soaring into the sky. [Xiao Kejian] stands resolutely in the midst of it all, in the final moments of her life. In her mind, she keeps seeing Mei's sweet smile and the unicorn she always wore on her chest, symbolizing happiness. But in the end, even the unicorn couldn't bring happiness to the two of them.
1:26:20|1:26:27|The raging fire illuminated [Xiao Kejian]'s face, tears that he had been holding back finally shimmered and sparkled under the light.
1:26:27|1:26:30|Apart from reluctance, there was also resentment towards the foreign powers on his face.
1:26:30|1:26:46|The decision is about to be made, and the flames are getting closer to [Xiao Kejian]. He stands still, as if he can't feel the pain, gradually being engulfed by the fire. In the end, [Xiao Kejian] uses this incomprehensible way to fulfill his patriotic ideals, and the raging fire rushes towards the flags of the three countries.
1:26:46|1:26:51|In just a moment, everything here turned into ashes, with billowing black smoke rising straight into the sky.
1:26:51|1:26:57|The flames slowly subsided, but the sacrifice made by [Xiao Kejian] will surely leave a profound mark.
1:26:57|1:26:58|The protest action ends.
1:26:59|1:27:5|[Mei] and [Gu Weijun] came to the Huagong Cemetery together, where a new tombstone appeared with the name of [Xiao Kejian] written on it.
1:27:5|1:27:8|In this meeting, [Gu Weijun] can no longer argue with [Mei].
1:27:8|1:27:15|He lit a match, holding it in his hand for a while until the matchstick burned halfway, then he slowly lit the candle.
1:27:15|1:27:21|[Xiao Kejian]'s sacrifice left [Gu Weijun] in shock for a moment. He stood in silence in front of the tombstone, his expression filled with sorrow.
1:27:21|1:27:26|[Mei] clasped her hands together, tears the size of beans rolling down from her eyes, the sparkle in her eyes long gone.
1:27:27|1:27:32|The Hua Nation Cemetery has stopped many people, and tonight the lights are on here.
1:27:32|1:27:45|On the eve of the conference's closing, we received 86 telegrams from overseas Chinese communities and domestic public groups around the world, all urging the delegation to refuse to sign the Treaty of Versailles.
1:27:46|1:27:59|In the blink of an eye, the time came to June 28, 1919. The gates of the Palace of Versailles opened once again, with carriages and cars entering one after another. Many people gathered in the hall, chatting in groups of two or three.
1:27:59|1:28:8|Someone is standing in the middle of the hall, someone is sitting at the table, everyone's face is expressionless, but whenever someone shakes hands with them, a fake smile appears.
1:28:8|1:28:14|In front of everyone, the scene was bustling with people coming and going, but [Wang Zhengting] and [Gu Weijun] were quiet and no one was talking to them.
1:28:14|1:28:21|The two sat at the front of the long table, with [Wang Zhengting] gazing at the crowd in a trance, while [Gu Weijun] remained solemn and silent.
1:28:21|1:28:26|[Mei] and other members of the presidium sat on the stage, preparing the materials.
1:28:26|1:28:33|Seeing that the time was almost up, he stood up to ring the bell of consciousness. The people in the hall all walked back to their seats, and the room gradually quieted down.
1:28:33|1:28:43|German Minister of State John Neesbell and German Foreign Minister Herman Muller, officials of the defeated country, also sat down slowly. Their seats were different from those of other countries, as they sat directly opposite the podium.
1:28:44|1:28:51|At this moment, [Very Wong] took over the meeting and arrogantly addressed John Nisbell and Herman Mueller:
1:29:2|1:29:8|After speaking, [Gu Weijun] and the other two representatives stood up and walked towards the signing table under the gaze of everyone.
1:29:8|1:29:9|The two of them walked very slowly.
1:29:9|1:29:12|[Mei] hunched over, not daring to lift her head.
1:29:12|1:29:16|Herman Muller sat down slowly, sighed deeply, and picked up a pen to prepare to sign.
1:29:16|1:29:19|His expression was full of unwillingness and sadness. 
1:29:19|1:29:24|John Nisbel stood behind him, his brow furrowed, staring intently at the treaty.
1:29:24|1:29:25|Herman Muller's hand holding the pen trembled slightly.
1:29:26|1:29:29|For a long time, he slowly signed his name.
1:29:29|1:29:35|After signing the document, he put the pen aside, held back tears, stood up from the table, and walked away step by step.
1:29:35|1:29:38|Following him, the representative of the victorious country stepped forward to sign.
1:29:38|1:29:49|President Wilson of the United States sat down at the table first. After sitting down, he took out his glasses from his pocket and put them on. He had a smile on his face, with the corners of his mouth lifted, presenting a stark contrast to Herman Muller.
1:29:49|1:29:55|He picked up a pen and signed his name on the treaty word by word, while his assistant lit a fire on the candle nearby.
1:29:56|1:30:13|After [Wilson] signed the document, the firearms were already ignited. An assistant placed the firearms next to the signature, tied with a ribbon to signify co-signing, proving that all signatories of this treaty signed together at the same time and place, enhancing the anti-counterfeiting effect to a certain extent.
1:30:13|1:30:22|After President Wilson signed, French Prime Minister ClÃ©ment Mon[so] followed closely, proudly signed his own name and left with a flourish.
1:30:22|1:30:34|Following that were the British Prime Minister, Lord George, and the Italian Prime Minister, Orlando. The two of them, as usual, were serious, expressionless, and casual in their movements, as if the treaty was just an ordinary document.
1:30:34|1:30:39|After several representatives from different countries signed their names, it was finally China's turn to take the stage.
1:30:39|1:30:44|Gu Weijun slowly stood up, and the reporters standing next to him raised their cameras and aimed at him.
1:30:45|1:30:49|[Gu Weijun] showed rare signs of panic and worry on his face at this moment.
1:30:49|1:30:52|He seems to be thinking about something and worrying about something at the same time.
1:30:52|1:30:57|He walked slowly towards the signing table, but did not stop there.
1:30:57|1:31:0|He continued to walk forward, eventually stopping in front of the podium.
1:31:0|1:31:3|On the rostrum, several people looked at him inexplicably.
1:31:3|1:31:7|[Gu Weijun] took a deep breath and said slowly.
1:31:17|1:31:22|He scanned the surroundings and for a moment his words seemed to stick in his throat.
1:31:22|1:31:31|After another pause, whispers started to spread among the audience.
1:32:27|1:32:32|At this point, [Gu Weijun] frowned.
1:32:32|1:32:37|[Gu Weijun] gritted his teeth, feeling unbearable heartache as he looked at the contract filled with words, then slowly closed it.
1:32:44|1:32:46|The whole scene was in an uproar, followed by [Gu Weijun]'s words.
1:33:3|1:33:12|[Gu Weijun] knocked on the contract with force, then left the hall quietly. The anger on his face had not subsided, his eyes looking straight ahead, filled with determination.
1:33:12|1:33:20|Reporters rushed forward, vying to secure the best position to capture this decisive moment, with Wang Zhengting following closely behind, walking out confidently and coolly.
1:33:20|1:33:32|The hall instantly boiled over, everyone was discussing the matter. [Xiao Kejian] stood up and fiercely hammered a gavel, but to no avail. He repeatedly struck it several times, but no one paid any attention, and the situation completely spiraled out of control.
1:33:32|1:33:41|The large door slowly opened, [Gu Weijun] and [Wang Zhengping] walked out side by side, and both involuntarily paused at the door, apparently still not recovered from the shock.
1:33:46|1:33:55|China is the only victorious country that did not sign the agreement. [Gu Weijun] and [Wang Zhengping] walked slowly towards their car, opened the door and got in.
1:34:5|1:34:12|The car started slowly, with [Gu Weijun] and [Wang Zhengping] remaining silent. [Wang Zhengping] looked out the window with a face full of sadness.
1:34:12|1:34:17|[Gu Weijun] had a vacant look in his eyes as he put on his hat, looking completely lifeless.
1:34:31|1:34:36|[Gu Weijun] pondered with a thoughtful expression, and the figure of [Xiao Kejian] involuntarily appeared in his mind.
1:34:52|1:34:56|The car drove up to the iron gate of the Palace of Versailles, where many people were seen standing behind the railing.
1:34:56|1:35:2|[Mei] stood at the front, her eyes swollen, tears on the verge of falling.
1:35:2|1:35:6|She stared intently inside, quietly waiting for the news from the Chinese delegation.
1:35:6|1:35:12|Mei is running on the street, shouting victory. Xiao Kejian, the soldier, is also here, still naked and injured, with messy hair.
1:35:12|1:35:18|The only change is that the cans that once covered the whole body, now only one is left.
1:35:18|1:35:20|She hung on the iron gate, singing religious songs loudly.
1:35:21|1:35:33|Ranya arrived here, along with many French people gathered here besides him. Everyone's gaze was on the soldier, and the emotions in everyone's eyes were very complex. [Gu Weijun] frowned at this moment, looking extremely melancholic.
