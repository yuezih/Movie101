0:0:37|0:0:48|At this moment, [Uncle Shi] is practicing martial arts in front of the candlelight, smiling as he swings the stick, frozen in the moment when he lifts it up.
0:0:50|0:1:1|A seagull flies over the water, forming a reflection in the water. A challenge letter is stabbed on the stove with a dagger, and three incense sticks are burning in the stove. [Zhang Ying] and Jin Fu stand facing each other on both sides of the stove.
0:1:1|0:1:6|At this moment, Mother Jin is hiding in the distant bushes with her three siblings, watching the opposite side, with ribbons tied on her head.
0:1:7|0:1:10|Uncle Shi stared solemnly at Zhang Ying with a furrowed brow.
0:1:10|0:1:15|[Zhang Ying] clenched his fist, in an instant, Vice Jin raised his fists and charged towards [Zhang Ying].
0:1:15|0:1:19|After that, the two of them exchanged punches on the floor covered with tiles.
0:1:19|0:1:22|[Zhang Ying] throws a punch, hitting [Jin Jixun] and pushing him towards the side.
0:1:22|0:1:25|In an instant, [Zhang Ying] lifted her leg and kicked [Jin Jixun].
0:1:25|0:1:30|Afterwards, [Jin Jixun] soared into the air, swiftly delivering a back kick followed by a punch towards [Zhang Ying].
0:1:30|0:1:32|[Zhang Ying] uses her hands to block the dense flurry of punches.
0:1:33|0:1:39|In the bushes, [Jin Jishi] looked at the two fighting figures with tears in his eyes, while the three siblings cried out continuously.
0:1:39|0:1:44|[Jin Jishi]'s legs, like phantom, continuously kick towards [Zhang Ying], pushing [Zhang Ying] back with a blow to the chest.
0:1:44|0:1:50|Afterwards, the two of them leaped into the air and then performed a backflip before engaging in a fierce fight together.
0:1:50|0:1:56|At this moment, [Jin Jishi] soared into the air and lunged at [Zhang Ying], who blocked the attack with both arms.
0:1:56|0:1:58|In the distance, the children kept crying and shouting for battle.
0:1:59|0:2:3|At this moment, [Zhang Ying] waved his arms, creating afterimages in the air.
0:2:3|0:2:8|She kept launching attacks towards [Jin Jixun], who was forced to retreat repeatedly.
0:2:8|0:2:13|In an instant, [Zhang Ying] kicked [Jin Jixun] in the chest, and finally, [Jin Jixun] stabbed [Zhang Ying] in the arm with a knife.
0:2:14|0:2:27|Uncle Shi quickly pounced on Zhang Ying, who kept punching and forcing Jin Jishi to retreat repeatedly. Then, a flying kick knocked Jin Jishi to the ground, and instantly, a large amount of blood spurted from his mouth.
0:2:27|0:2:37|At this moment, [Jin Jishi] slowly stood up, staring at [Jin Jixun] with widened eyes. [Jin Jixun] staggered to his feet and walked towards the incense burner. Then, she covered her chest and pulled out the dagger inserted in the incense burner.
0:2:37|0:2:48|Following that, [Jin Jishi] slowly raised the dagger, the sunlight reflecting on the ground. In an instant, he forcefully stabbed the dagger into his own abdomen. Afterwards, [Jin Jishi] fell to his knees with five wounds on his chest.
0:2:48|0:2:55|At the sight, [Jin Jishi] fainted in tears, the children cried out loudly and shook [Jin Jishi] lying on the ground with all their might.
0:2:56|0:3:1|Uncle Shi's clothes were soaked in blood, also wetting Zhang Ying's fluttering trousers.
0:3:1|0:3:7|By the riverbank, with the breeze gently rippling the water, [Zhang Ying] turned around and weakly knelt down in front of [Jin Jishi].
0:3:7|0:3:12|In the early morning, [Zhang Ying] knelt in front of Sun Chengmu, while Uncle Shi was slowly walking towards him.
0:3:59|0:4:4|After speaking, [Uncle Shi] turned and walked towards the distance, leaving [Mrs. Liu] kneeling alone in place.
0:4:13|0:4:24|A thin mist lingered in the chaotic sky, and the cold wind stirred the leaves around the tombstones. The dry grass and fallen leaves intertwined on the ground, making [Zhang Ying]'s figure appear particularly desolate.
0:4:24|0:4:33|At this moment, the screen shows the movie title "Dragon Spring World", jointly produced by Changchun Film Studio and Beijing Young Army Film and Television Culture Co., Ltd.
0:4:34|0:4:44|The entire film showcases the profoundness of Chinese martial arts and promotes the idea of enhancing physical fitness through martial arts. It tells the story of the martial spirit of universal love, mutual assistance, and humility.
0:4:44|0:4:48|The film was released in China on January 22, 2008.
0:4:49|0:4:53|At the same time, the film has attracted many young movie enthusiasts from the mainland to participate.
0:4:53|0:5:0|At noon, under the scorching sun, Wang Chenhao, Uncle Shi, and Jin Jixun are standing on the playground, swaggering and urinating.
0:5:0|0:5:7|They swayed their bodies while looking up at the sky, the monkey-faced creature smiling, exchanging glances with Wang Chenhao.
0:5:7|0:5:11|At this moment, [Zhang Ying], who was sweeping the floor on the side, slowly walked over with a broom.
0:5:43|0:5:47|On the other side, a small car stopped inside the martial arts school.
0:5:47|0:5:51|Jin Jixun, Jin Jishi, and Jin Jixiu, the three siblings, got out of the car with Butler Zhou.
0:5:51|0:5:54|They looked around, gazing at the scenery inside the school.
0:5:54|0:6:2|At this moment, [Zhang Ying] hurriedly ran over.
0:6:2|0:6:9|Following that, under the guidance of [Zhang Ying], the group walked and observed, passing through students in school uniforms practicing martial arts on the playground.
0:6:15|0:6:23|The students are performing the high kicks in a neat and orderly manner.
0:6:23|0:6:28|Shortly after, [Zhang Ying] led them to the front of Principal Sun's office.
0:6:28|0:6:31|[Zhang Ying] raised his hand to gesture inviting them in.
0:6:31|0:6:34|They then entered the office one by one.
0:7:2|0:7:15|Principal smiled and took the handmade tea from [Jin Jishi]. Then, [Jin Jixun] and [Jin Jishi] struggled to hold onto Principal Sun's hand. In an instant, [Jin Jixun] flew forward and fell on his head.
0:7:29|0:7:35|In the classroom, Fei Niu, Shou Hou, and [Hu Zhi] are playing around, while Wang Chenghao and Peng Lili sit on the side.
0:7:35|0:7:39|At this moment, Teacher Wang walked in with the three siblings [Jin Jixun].
0:7:39|0:7:43|Soon after, Uncle Shi, Zhang Ying, Jin Jixun, and Jin Jishi quickly stood up.
0:8:5|0:8:15|After Teacher Wang left, [Jin Jixun] and [Jin Jishi] sat on the bench on the side.
0:8:15|0:8:24|Hu Zhi, Shou Hou, and Wang Chenghao quickly surrounded the siblings, Zhang Ying and Jin Jixun, while Peng Lili wrinkled her nose on the side, and Jin Jishi stood with his arms crossed, watching.
0:8:27|0:8:30|The skinny monkey hugged [Jin Jishi]'s slender arm, gazing at him infatuatedly.
0:8:40|0:8:49|Hu Zhi and Shou Hou hurriedly grabbed the candy from Zhang Ying's hand and put it into their mouths. The next day, Zhu the steward was video calling with Jin Jixun in the hotel.
0:10:7|0:10:14|In the luxurious villa, [Jin Huixian] slowly walked out of the kitchen with a bowl of soup medicine.
0:12:22|0:12:27|Speak up, [Jin Jixun] fell on the sofa in pain, covering his mouth and coughing.
0:12:27|0:12:31|At this moment, Jin Jixun's mother looked at the tissue in her hand, which had a bloodstain on it.
0:12:59|0:13:3|In the boxing classroom, the students are practicing martial arts passionately.
0:13:3|0:13:8|Classmates continuously punched at the gauze, while [Jin Jishi] and Peng Lili practiced kicking with each other.
0:13:8|0:13:11|At this moment, [Wang Chenhao] suddenly stood between the two.
0:13:24|0:13:35|Uncle Shi and Jin Jixun were playfully wrestling with each other, while Zhang Ying was practicing seriously with a ribbon on the side. After watching the two play, Jin Jixun took off his shirt and continued training with his bare upper body.
0:13:35|0:13:39|In the classroom, students were walking around in various corners, earnestly practicing martial arts.
0:13:43|0:13:45|In the cafeteria, the children are lining up for food.
0:14:7|0:14:12|Wang Chenhao handed the cooked meal to Jin Jixun and his two siblings.
0:14:43|0:14:47|Jin Jixun and his two siblings pushed open the school gate and walked out, passing by the janitor who was sweeping the floor.
0:15:26|0:15:48|At this moment, [Zhang Ying] sat on the sofa holding a bottle of wine, drinking with a vacant look.
0:16:0|0:16:1|Uncle Shi's martial arts skills are much better than theirs.
0:16:14|0:16:14|He is in his forties with a scar on his left arm.
0:16:52|0:16:56|With the conversation ending, the three siblings sat on the sofa with sullen faces, bowing their heads.
0:17:42|0:17:47|Jing Jixiu pursed her lips and looked at [Uncle Shi], then nodded towards [Jin Jixun].
0:17:50|0:17:58|Later, everyone pushed and shoved their way downstairs together.
0:17:58|0:18:3|The elevator door in the mall slowly opens, and the children walk out of the elevator, laughing and jumping.
0:18:24|0:18:31|Speak up, [Jin Jixun] turned and left alone, while the others took the escalator to the cinema.
0:18:55|0:19:4|They walked into the interior of the cinema, looking around curiously while pointing at the exquisite and massive crystal chandelier on the ceiling.
0:19:4|0:19:10|Later, they happily arrived at the movie ticket counter, pointing and discussing animatedly as they selected a movie.
0:19:18|0:19:22|After getting their movie tickets, everyone happily turned and ran towards the theater.
0:19:22|0:19:32|At the same time, [Jin Jishi] was strolling around the hall, when suddenly he looked up and saw a sign for the Christmas set meal.
0:19:36|0:19:39|Shortly after, [Jin Jishi] followed Xiao Qin to the donation booth.
0:19:53|0:20:2|Just as [Jin Jishi] turned around to leave, he caught sight of the fox spirit in front of him holding a donation box. The fox spirit's lively eyes and sweet smile made him stop in his tracks.
0:20:55|0:20:59|On the other side, Wang Chenhao and [Jin Jixun] entered the screening room.
0:20:59|0:21:4|They happily gathered around the movie poster posted on the wall.
0:21:4|0:21:8|At this moment, Peng Lili followed Uncle Shi around to take a look.
0:21:8|0:21:13|Finally, the two held hands and suddenly, two thugs blocked their way.
0:21:23|0:21:27|Wang Chenghao arrived and immediately got into a scuffle with the thug.
0:21:27|0:21:30|On the other side, Jin Jixun observed the situation here.
0:21:30|0:21:34|Wang Chenghao turned around and lifted his leg, instantly kicking a thug away.
0:21:34|0:21:39|After the thug fell to the ground, he got up holding his chest and then fled in panic.
0:21:39|0:21:42|Immediately after, another thug was knocked down by Wang Chenghao.
0:21:50|0:21:54|At this moment, Uncle Shi kicked away the lantern on his head, and the thug quickly fled.
0:21:58|0:22:6|At the same time, on the other side of the wooden table, covered with paper cranes, Jin Jixun was carefully folding the card paper in his hand, while Hu Zhi threw the paper in his hand to the side.
0:22:57|0:23:3|Although one is flexible and the other is rigid, both use physical movements to express human emotions.
0:23:22|0:23:31|Night falls, [Jin Jixun] walks side by side with [Hu Zhi] on the deserted street, passing by a coffee shop with laughter.
0:23:45|0:23:49|Just then, Uncle Shi and Zhang Ying suddenly appeared in front of them.
0:24:16|0:24:18|[Hu Zhi] turned his head to look at the departing Tiger Eyebrow, and let out a deep sigh.
0:24:38|0:24:52|At the same time, Wang Chenghao and others climbed over the railing back into the school. Shortly after, they quietly took out school uniforms, cautiously looking around while tiptoeing towards the guard at the gate. They secretly crouched by the guard's window and peered inside.
0:24:53|0:24:59|In the guard room at this moment, [Zhang Ying] is wearing a tank top, bare arms, and drunkenly playing chess.
0:24:59|0:25:8|[Zhang Ying] has a coin-sized scar above his left arm. He clumsily stacks the chess pieces together, then proceeds to set up the chessboard and play by himself.
0:25:8|0:25:11|The children were lying on the window, constantly stretching their heads to look out.
0:25:12|0:25:15|Peng Lili frowned, while [Zhang Chenghao] widened his eyes.
0:25:15|0:25:21|The beastly monkey and the fat ox stretched their necks, while [Uncle Shi] hid under the window observing [Zhang Ying]'s actions.
0:25:21|0:25:25|Following that, [Zhang Ying] picked up the bottle of wine in front of her and drank it all in one gulp.
0:25:25|0:25:29|Upon seeing the situation, the children quietly put on their school uniforms and left one after another.
0:25:29|0:25:33|Inside the house, [Zhang Ying] exuded a strong smell of alcohol under the dim light.
0:25:33|0:25:38|She was engrossed in playing chess, her eyes fixed on the pieces in her hand.
0:25:38|0:25:41|The next morning, Uncle Shi lazily leaned against the railing.
0:26:33|0:26:39|In the afternoon, [Jin Jixun] approached Wang Chenghao, who was practicing dancing in the classroom.
0:27:15|0:27:17|[Zhang Ying] is sweeping the floor on the side.
0:27:22|0:27:24|In the evening, Jin Jixun returned to the hotel.
0:27:26|0:27:31|The gatekeeper of the martial arts school has a scar on his left arm.
0:27:40|0:27:44|While Jin Jixun was half squatting and talking to Butler Zhou, Jin Jishi walked in and stood in front of the two.
0:28:11|0:28:15|Why are you not at school? Just as he was speaking, [Jin Jixun] raised his hand, ready to punch [Jin Jishi].
0:28:15|0:28:17|Steward Zhou signaled him to stop with his eyes.
0:28:37|0:28:40|Shortly after, [Jin Jishi] arrived at the side of Mu Juan, the fox spirit medium.
0:28:40|0:28:46|Saying that, [Jin Jishi] took out a handbag from behind and handed it to the fox matchmaker.
0:29:9|0:29:13|Suddenly, Jin Jixun appeared beside the two of them.
0:30:1|0:30:5|At this moment, [Hu Mei] is sitting on the sofa in the living room, tutoring [Hu Zhi] in his studies.
0:30:5|0:30:9|[Zhang Ying] walked over with a beer in her arms.
0:32:14|0:32:20|Shortly after, the three siblings [Jin Jixun] were sitting in the back row of the classroom, lifting their heads and pondering quietly.
0:32:30|0:32:33|Steward Zhou handed the phone to [Jin Jixun].
0:33:6|0:33:11|At the martial arts competition, the host is standing on the stage, while the children are sitting below the stage.
0:33:33|0:33:37|[Uncle Shi] stood on the second-floor balcony, drinking tea and observing the activities downstairs.
0:33:37|0:33:42|At this moment, the girl with short hair stepped onto the stage first, followed closely by [Jin Jixun].
0:33:47|0:34:5|The short-haired girl first lifted her leg to kick [Jin Jixun], who blocked with his hand, then kicked her in return. The short-haired girl launched another attack, and [Jin Jixun] punched her in the face. She fell heavily to the ground, followed by [Peng Lili] jumping onto the ring and bowing to the referee.
0:34:6|0:34:18|[Peng Lili] and [Jin Jishi] faced each other and immediately started to fight. At this moment, Butler Zhou was fiercely banging the gong, but when he saw Principal Sun looking at him, he quickly put away his fierce expression and turned it into a smile.
0:34:18|0:34:30|[Peng Lili] instantly swore and launched a series of attacks towards [Jin Jishi] with her fists. Her rapidly dancing fists formed lightning-like shadows in the air, while [Jin Jishi] struggled to defend himself.
0:34:30|0:34:36|In an instant, [Jin Jishi] was caught by [Peng Lili] with both hands, then [Peng Lili] kicked [Jin Jishi] to the ground.
0:34:45|0:34:50|Afterwards, [Hu Zhi] and Uncle Shi took the stage first.
0:34:50|0:34:53|Uncle Shi and Jin Jixun on stage simultaneously lifted their legs and kicked towards each other.
0:34:53|0:34:57|Jin Jishi once again turned around and kicked, Uncle Shi quickly dodged.
0:34:57|0:35:1|At this moment, [Jin Jishi] grabbed [Uncle Shi]'s arm and kept kicking to attack the opponent.
0:35:1|0:35:4|Continuing, he kept throwing punches, and [Uncle Shi] was knocked down to the ground.
0:35:8|0:35:11|[Skinny Monkey] quickly jumps onto the stage to battle with [Jin Jishi].
0:35:11|0:35:17|[Uncle Shi] lifted his leg to attack [Jin Jishi], who dodged by bending down, then took the opportunity to trip [Uncle Shi] to the ground.
0:35:17|0:35:23|Uncle Shi stood up and hugged Jin Jishi's leg, while Jin Jishi used his elbow to block the attack.
0:35:23|0:35:25|Soon after, [Uncle Shi] pinned [Jin Jishi] down.
0:35:27|0:35:32|At this moment, [Jin Jishi] suddenly rushed onto the stage, and two students below also rushed up.
0:35:32|0:35:36|Both of them were knocked down by [Jin Jishi], while [Uncle Shi] watched attentively from the second floor.
0:35:36|0:35:42|Wang Chenghao then took the stage and started fighting with Jin Jishi, exchanging rapid punches with each other.
0:35:42|0:35:49|Shortly after, [Jin Jishi] spun around and launched a high kick towards [Wang Chenghao], while [Hu Zhi] in the audience waved his fists eagerly.
0:35:49|0:35:58|At this moment, [Jin Jixun] kept attacking Wang Chenghao. In an instant, [Jin Jixun] kicked Wang Chenghao and sent him flying to the stage, where the surrounding reporters were busy taking photos.
0:37:1|0:37:13|[Jin Jixun] walked up to Principal, and at that moment, [Jin Jixun] suddenly threw a punch at the Principal. The surrounding reporters snapped photos, and Principal Sun was punched and spat out blood in the corner.
0:37:13|0:37:20|Just then, [Jin Jixun] was suddenly knocked down to the ground. After he got up, [Zhang Ying] used a series of punches to knock him down.
0:37:28|0:37:32|Next, Uncle Shi suddenly ran over from a distance.
0:39:40|0:39:46|Shortly after, Butler Zhou waved his hand, and the siblings [Jin Jixun] followed Butler Zhou out of the martial arts competition.
0:39:46|0:39:54|Marquis Shou stood angrily in place, while Peng Lili and others supported the fainted Jin Zhi. Zhang Ying stared blankly at the backs of the departing group.
0:40:31|0:40:39|After Jin Jishi questioned Xiaoqin, she hurriedly left.
0:40:39|0:40:48|At this moment, the revolving door of the hotel slowly opens, and Butler Zhou and Jin Jiuxiu walk out of the hotel together, shoulder to shoulder, and arrive at the hotel lobby.
0:40:53|0:41:0|Suddenly, the two stopped in their tracks and looked up and down in front of them. [Uncle Shi] stood in front of them, with one hand behind his back.
0:41:2|0:41:5|Steward Zhou pursed his lips and frowned, looking at [Uncle Shi].
0:41:58|0:42:3|Steward Zhou pulled [Jin Jixun] and walked out of the hotel lobby with big strides.
0:42:3|0:42:6|Uncle Shi stood still, watching their backs.
0:42:6|0:42:9|On the other side, [Jin Jixun] is trying to run into the hospital gate.
0:42:9|0:42:13|At the same time, in the ward, Wang Chenghao was looking at the unconscious [Hu Zhi] with concern.
0:42:13|0:42:17|Wang Chenghao sat by Uncle Hu's bed with tears in his eyes, with Peng Lili standing behind him.
0:42:17|0:42:22|Uncle Shi wept bitterly while the fat cow beside him, tears streaming continuously from the eyes of Skinny Monkey.
0:42:22|0:42:27|At this moment, [Jin Jishi] has arrived at the entrance of the nurse station, looking around constantly.
0:42:27|0:42:35|In the spacious hospital corridor, [Jin Jishi] stood still, and at that moment, he saw the fox spirit sitting on a bench beside him.
0:42:35|0:42:45|As [Jin Jishi] approached the fox spirit, the fox spirit raised its head with tears in its big watery eyes, reflecting the figure of [Jin Jishi]. Tears the size of soybeans rolled down his cheeks.
0:42:45|0:42:53|Suddenly, the monkey in the ward saw the back of [Jin Jishi], and he ran out crying angrily, grabbing [Jin Jishi]'s collar.
0:43:9|0:43:21|Wang Chenhao smashed his fist on [Jin Jishi], [Hu Mei] stood up, and [Uncle Shi] and others surrounded [Jin Jishi].
0:43:21|0:43:24|Then, Hu Mei stood in front of the ward door, with her back to Jin Jishi.
0:45:9|0:45:13|On the other side, [Zhang Ying] is sitting by Principal Sun's bed.
0:45:13|0:45:17|This matter has caused a sensation and become the focus of attention in the whole province.
0:46:42|0:46:45|However, in order to seek revenge, they will stop at nothing.
0:47:13|0:47:18|In Chinese chess, the horse and cannon each have different ways of moving.
0:47:53|0:48:2|Principal Sun lay down and Uncle Shi walked towards the side, deep in thought. He put down the newspaper, furrowing his brow, with his hands behind his back.
0:48:2|0:48:20|In the early morning of the fourth day, the children were practicing martial arts on the grass. The Monkey wrapped the double shoes stick around his body, [Peng Lili] played with flying knives, Fei Niu waved a long stick, [Wang Chenghao] spun the long sword in his hand. He quickly spun the sword around his body, followed by a backflip landing on the ground, immediately taking an oath, squatting halfway and holding the sword level.
0:48:21|0:48:28|At this moment, [Zhang Ying] walked over with a serious expression.
0:48:28|0:48:34|At noon, Wang Chenhao and [Peng Lili] arrived at the office of [Zhang Ying].
0:49:3|0:49:6|However, there is still one month left until the competition.
0:49:21|0:49:24|Hua Bi, [Zhang Ying] stood up with a teacup in hand.
0:49:30|0:49:32|So, the responsibility on your shoulders is great, I hope you can perform well in the competition.
0:50:1|0:50:18|In the narration, Wang Chenhao and Peng Lili looked at each other in confusion, then they secretly arrived at a closed corridor. They tiptoed through the corridor to a door, and then quietly opened a crack in the door to peek inside. In the room, [Uncle Shi] was standing in a circle of candles practicing internal energy.
0:50:19|0:50:26|The bamboo platform under the bamboo fire is about a foot high, with flames constantly flickering. The sweat beads on [Uncle Shi]'s body glisten like dew.
0:50:26|0:50:33|The bamboo fire reflected on the strong and powerful arms of [Uncle Shi], highlighting the clear lines of his muscles in a heroic manner.
0:50:33|0:50:43|At this moment, [Uncle Shi] suddenly spread out his arms, lifted his palms in front of his chest, then he opened his hands, fingers striking out a series of punches like a praying mantis, before stopping in place.
0:50:44|0:51:3|Uncle Shi stood in a horse stance, waving his hands continuously. At this moment, Wang Chenghao and Peng Lili outside the door watched Uncle Shi with wide eyes. Then Uncle Shi spread his arms, continuously punching forward along the surrounding candles. The style of his punches kept changing. Uncle Shi pushed his palms forward, then struck in the air, extinguishing the candle flames instantly.
0:51:4|0:51:19|Outside the door, the two men stared intently. At this moment, [Uncle Shi] once again swung his fist into the air. He bent his arms, slightly leaned his body forward, and struck out with a pick fist. His hands alternated forward continuously, creating gusts of cold wind in the air, resembling a fierce tiger in action.
0:51:23|0:51:31|Afterwards, [Uncle Shi] picked up a long stick and swiftly swung it into the air.
0:51:31|0:51:44|The long stick in the hands of [Uncle Shi] kept moving, and the surrounding candles danced along. As [Uncle Shi] continuously waved the stick, the spinning stick in the air cast overlapping shadows, while he kept striking forward.
0:51:44|0:51:48|The stick vibrated the air, and the surrounding candles were extinguished in an instant.
0:51:48|0:51:54|Uncle Shi then raised the stick by his side, Peng Lili and Wang Chenhao, seeing this, immediately closed the door.
0:51:54|0:51:57|Uncle Shi stood still, with a faint smile on his face.
0:51:57|0:52:5|It's late at night, Peng Lili and Wang Chenhao are practicing martial arts in the backyard. The cement path under their feet is painted with a chessboard pattern, with chess pieces placed inside the squares.
0:52:6|0:52:11|Peng Lili and Wang Chenhao were practicing martial arts, but both slipped on the wet ground.
0:52:11|0:52:14|After falling down, they all got up one after another and continued dancing.
0:52:14|0:52:17|At the same time, [Zhang Ying] sat aside, playing chess and drinking alone.
0:52:17|0:52:22|Peng Lili lifted her leg high for a front kick, while Wang Chenhao practiced martial arts with a horse stance beside her.
0:52:29|0:52:46|Four days later, the morning sun shone on the plaque of the Great Hero Hall, and the towering trees swayed in the breeze. In front of the hall, there was an incense burner marked with the traces of time, emitting wisps of smoke from the burning incense. The stone lions placed symmetrically in front of the hall had their mouths open, looking very majestic.
0:52:47|0:53:5|In the main hall at this moment, [Peng Lili] and [Wang Chenhao] are practicing martial arts, while [Zhang Ying] is watching them seriously on the side. The hall is filled with long hanging curtains, on which are written densely packed Buddhist scriptures. Rows of Buddha statues are neatly arranged on stone pedestals, with [Wang Chenhao] and [Peng Lili] standing next to a giant Buddha statue that is about ten meters high.
0:53:5|0:53:14|Serious practicing martial arts, the two of them stood with a horse stance, their lower bodies fixed, and their arms constantly waving in the air. On the side, [Zhang Ying] watched with hands behind his back.
0:53:14|0:53:26|At this moment, [Peng Lili] began practicing high kicks, as she kicked her legs, she turned and walked backwards, continuously practicing her palm techniques. Meanwhile, [Wang Chenhao] clenched his teeth tightly and rapidly punched into the air.
0:53:26|0:53:37|After a quick turn, he changed the position of his hands to tiger claws, then took big steps forward, practicing tiger claws alternately with his left and right hands. [Zhang Ying] nodded approvingly as she watched from the side.
0:53:37|0:53:43|Later, [Wang Chenhao] arrived at a few candles and quickly struck out with Tiger Fist, causing the candles to be extinguished one by one.
0:53:43|0:53:48|At noon that day, [Peng Lili] and [Wang Chenhao] sat side by side in the cafeteria, eating their meals.
0:53:48|0:53:52|Wang Chenhao had a bruise on his shoulder, at this moment, Uncle Shi walked over.
0:54:43|0:54:54|At the same time, the three siblings [Jin Jixun] were standing in a luxurious villa, with [Jin Huitai] sitting on a stone chair in the courtyard watching them, while the siblings stood by the stone table.
0:54:54|0:55:2|At this moment, [Jin Huixian] held a cigar in one hand and a glass of red wine in the other, while the three siblings stood on the side with their heads down.
0:55:2|0:55:4|[Jin Jixun] picked up a wine glass and took a sip of red wine.
0:57:12|0:57:16|Jin Jixun lay weakly on the bed, then she opened her eyes and looked at Jin Jishi.
0:59:19|0:59:23|Speak up, [Jin Jishi] turned and left, then [Jin Jixun] stared with wide eyes and fell by the bed.
0:59:29|0:59:34|Steward Zhou placed his hand on [Jin Jishi]'s shoulder, only to be pushed away.
0:59:34|0:59:40|That night, [Zhang Ying] was practicing martial arts with Wang Chenghao and Peng Lili in the classroom.
0:59:40|0:59:47|Zhang Ying watched attentively from the side. At this moment, Peng Lili and Wang Chenghao stopped their movements, and Zhang Ying walked over slowly.
1:0:24|1:0:30|Soon, Wang Chenhao and Peng Lili turned and left, while [Zhang Ying] frowned as she watched their retreating figures.
1:0:30|1:0:36|The next morning, Wu Mei sat on the sofa, looking at the letter in her hand, while Uncle Shi was sound asleep beside her.
1:1:31|1:1:34|[Hu Zhi] woke up and stared at Fox Mei's eyes with a furrowed brow.
1:1:34|1:1:41|At this moment, Uncle Shi turned his head.
1:1:41|1:1:43|Shortly after, [Hu Zhi] lay down again.
1:1:43|1:1:46|The fox spirit [Hu Zhi] covered the blanket and then picked up the letter on the table.
1:1:49|1:2:0|A few days later, Wang Chenghao was practicing martial arts with a long stick in the bamboo forest. Uncle Shi, with Hu Zhi standing beside him, followed Zhang Ying. Wang Chenghao was shirtless, continuously striking the dry grass around him with the stick.
1:2:3|1:2:20|Wu Zhi stood in the distance clapping his hands, while [Zhang Ying] stood with his hands behind his back, watching Wang Chenghao intently. Wu had a big smile on his face as he patted Wu Zhi's shoulder. At that moment, a thin layer of sweat appeared on Wang Chenghao's body, and the muscles on his body looked very strong under the sunlight.
1:2:20|1:2:32|Wang Chenghao kept hitting the dry grass around him. Then, he raised the stick above his head and continuously rotated it on both sides of his body, creating multiple shadows in the air. Immediately after, he broke a section of the liver bamboo.
1:2:34|1:2:40|Wang Chenghao swung the stick behind him.
1:2:40|1:2:44|In an instant, a thick and tall blue bamboo suddenly fell to the ground.
1:3:2|1:3:14|The next morning, Uncle Shi examined Hu Zhi's body, with Hu Mei and Xiao Qing standing by watching. Uncle Shi carefully felt Hu Zhi's muscles and bones, then stood up and looked at Hu Zhi.
1:4:3|1:4:9|The sun is about to set, [Uncle Shi] sits alone by the window of the cafe, watching the bustling street.
1:4:9|1:4:18|[Hu Mei]'s eyes flickered with the figures of pedestrians. She lowered her head in melancholy, stirring the beverage in her hand, the orange tea in the glass pot was sweet and sour.
1:4:18|1:4:22|[Hu Mei] looked at the orange tea, her eyes devoid of any light.
1:4:22|1:4:28|At this moment, Xiaoqin appeared in the coffee shop, carrying a backpack, wearing jeans, and a big smile on her face.
1:4:28|1:4:31|Xiaoqin bounced over to the side of Humei.
1:5:24|1:5:25|Finally, [Hu Mei] arrived by the side of [Zhang Ying].
1:6:33|1:6:38|With those words, [Zhang Ying] turned around and walked away, and the fox matchmaker quickly followed.
1:7:11|1:7:16|[Zhang Ying] nodded, and then [Hu Mei] frowned and walked away from [Zhang Ying].
1:7:16|1:7:20|[Zhang Ying] stood in place, looking worriedly at the departing figure of [Hu Mei].
1:7:20|1:7:25|A few days later, [Wang Chenghao] and [Peng Lili] walked side by side on the campus path, carrying their luggage.
1:7:25|1:7:30|[Shou Hou] stood beside [Wang Chenghao], holding his bag, while [Hu Mei] led [Hu Zhi] following behind [Peng Lili].
1:7:43|1:7:47|[Uncle Shi] handed the package to [Wang Chenghao], and then they left first.
1:8:21|1:8:30|Principal Sun is talking to Zhang Ying when Wang Chenhao and his group walk up to Zhang Ying.
1:8:30|1:8:43|Speak up, after shaking hands with Principal Sun, [Zhang Ying] left with [Jin Jixun] and the others.
1:8:43|1:8:46|In the hotel lobby, [Zhang Ying] is packing luggage with the children.
1:10:51|1:10:58|Shortly after, [Jin Jishi] left the hotel with Butler Zhou, the three siblings [Hu Zhi], and the four top experts.
1:10:58|1:11:1|[Zhang Ying] stood with the children watching them leave.
1:11:1|1:11:6|The next day, [Hu Mei] stood in front of a bridal shop, looking at the posters at the door.
1:11:6|1:11:11|Just as Uncle Shi was engrossed in watching, Zhang Ying quietly approached from the side.
1:11:11|1:11:14|Shortly after, Uncle Shi grabbed Zhang Ying's hand as soon as he saw the situation.
1:12:26|1:12:29|[Hu Mei] turned around crying, looking at the red plum blossom.
1:12:45|1:12:49|Later, [Uncle Shi] turned around and walked away, unable to bear watching her back.
1:13:0|1:13:5|It's late at night, Wu Mei sits on the edge of the bed, holding the shoes that [Hu Mei] gave her.
1:13:49|1:14:1|At this moment, [Hu Mei] sat alone on the edge of the bed, looking down at the pair of shoes in her hands. She kept touching the surface of the shoes, frowning tightly, tears rolling in her eyes.
1:14:1|1:14:12|The next morning, [Zhang Ying] took Wang Chenghao, Peng Lili, [Hu Mei], and Xiaoqin to the ancestral hall of the three siblings [Jin Jixun] in Jingshi, where they were offering incense and bowing. The group stood in a row in the hall, lighting incense.
1:14:51|1:15:3|After finishing speaking, Uncle Shi, Zhang Ying, Jin Jixun, and Jin Jishi all inserted the incense in their hands into the censer, then put their hands together in front of them and bowed in salute.
1:15:53|1:15:59|Following that, the three siblings [Jin Jixun] jumped down from the wooden pavilion next to Butler Zhou and Jin Huitai.
1:15:59|1:16:3|At the same time, Wang Chenghao and Peng Lili also ran towards the direction of the three siblings.
1:16:3|1:16:11|Jin Huitai puffed on his cigar, smiled at Butler Zhou, while [Zhang Ying] looked serious across from him, Xiaoqin helped [Hu Mei] walk forward.
1:16:11|1:16:19|At this moment, Wang Chenghao and [Jin Jixun] jumped onto the wooden stool. [Jin Jixun] lifted his leg and kicked towards Wang Chenghao, who leaned back to dodge.
1:16:19|1:16:31|Shortly after, [Jin Jixun] kicked Wang Chenghao off the wooden stool with one foot. Wang Chenghao fell backwards and immediately got up to counterattack, hitting [Jin Jixun] who dodged backwards.
1:16:31|1:16:40|On the other side, Peng Lili had the little Luolos lying on the ground, and the four masters stepped forward to confront them. Among them, a man and a woman were facing off against Peng Lili.
1:16:40|1:16:48|Two other men approached [Zhang Ying]. Just as the two men were about to throw punches, [Zhang Ying] stepped in and knocked them down to the ground.
1:16:48|1:17:0|In an instant, [Jin Jixun] threw a punch at Wang Chenghao. Wang Chenghao grabbed his arm and the two continued to fight in mid-air. Wang Chenghao then kicked [Jin Jixun] down to the ground.
1:17:0|1:17:7|Jin Huitai widened his eyes on the side, Butler Zhou saw this and quietly retreated, Feng Lili was instantly knocked down by [Jin Jishi].
1:17:10|1:17:20|Following that, [Jin Jishi] launched an attack on Peng Lili, who kept retreating, while [Jin Jishi] intercepted Jin Jixun.
1:17:20|1:17:23|Wang Chenghao watched as [Jin Jixun] suddenly rushed towards him.
1:17:39|1:17:44|At this moment, Wang Chenghao grabbed Uncle Shi's hand and then kicked him away.
1:17:44|1:17:50|Jin Jixun fainted after blood dripped from the corner of his mouth, causing Steward Zhou to flee in a hurry, while the fox matchmaker beside him turned pale with fright.
1:17:53|1:18:10|In the central courtyard of the ancestral hall, everyone was in chaos. [Zhang Ying] was still dealing with several small Luo Luo, each holding a knife and being knocked down by [Zhang Ying]. Wu Mei and Xiao Qing stood on the side, constantly looking around with worry. The small Luo Luo kept stabbing towards [Zhang Ying] with their knives, at this moment,
1:18:10|1:18:26|A man wearing sunglasses suddenly appeared beside Wang Chenghao. The man walked towards Wang Chenghao and then started throwing punches at him. Wang Chenghao dodged and defended against the attacks, then lifted his leg to kick the man with sunglasses. The man dodged by bending down, then spun around and kicked Wang Chenghao in the face.
1:18:26|1:18:30|Uncle Shi turned around and continued to fight with the man in sunglasses.
1:18:30|1:18:34|Shortly after, the man in sunglasses was knocked down by Wang Chenghao.
1:18:34|1:18:37|After Wang Chenghao leaped into the air, he landed heavily on top of [the man in sunglasses].
1:18:37|1:18:43|Following that, Wang Chenghao went to help [Peng Lili], and [Jin Jixun] threw a punch at Wang Chenghao, who extended his arm to block it.
1:18:43|1:18:48|Shortly after, Wang Chenghao kicked [Jin Jixun] down, and [Jin Jixun] grimaced in pain, clutching his stomach.
1:18:49|1:18:58|On the other side, [Zhang Ying] groaned in pain, with her feet each straddling the chests of two little lolo.
1:18:58|1:19:4|Immediately, he grabbed Little Luo Luo's arm and kicked the other Little Luo Luo away with one leg.
1:19:4|1:19:11|At this moment, Jin Jishi hurried over, frowning as he watched everyone fighting, then turned to look at the Fox Eyebrows behind him.
1:19:11|1:19:16|At that moment, [Jin Jixun] pulled out a knife and threw it, hitting [Jin Jishi].
1:19:17|1:19:20|The ancestral hall was in a mess, and the Xiaoluos were beaten and lying on the ground wailing.
1:19:34|1:19:37|Suddenly, Uncle Shi pulled out a flying needle and threw it out.
1:19:37|1:19:42|At the same time, [Jin Jishi] pulled out a pistol, and [Zhang Ying] flicked away the flying needle with his finger.
1:19:42|1:19:47|The flying needle hit [Jin Jixun]'s hand. He dropped the gun, covered his hand, and slowly squatted down.
1:19:47|1:19:55|[Jin Jixun] had blood constantly flowing from his hand, he shook his head in pain, furrowing his brows, and large beads of sweat seeped from his forehead.
1:19:55|1:19:58|At this moment, [Zhang Ying] and Wang Chenghao slowly walked towards him from behind.
1:19:58|1:20:3|[Jin Jixun] holds his injured and bleeding hand, while [Zhang Ying] stops and stands beside him.
1:20:12|1:20:16|At this moment, [Zhang Ying] slowly squatted down, gazing at [Jin Jixun].
1:20:35|1:20:44|Shortly after, [Zhang Ying] helped [Jin Jixun] to stand up slowly by supporting his shoulder. He embraced [Jin Jixun] and walked forward, while [Jin Jixun] shook his head as they walked.
1:20:49|1:20:57|The two slowly walked towards the center of the ancestral hall, facing a cup belonging to Jin's father and mother. [Jin Jixun] lowered his head, tears rolling in his eyes.
1:20:57|1:21:8|Shortly after, [Zhang Ying] and [Jin Jixun] exchanged a smile. [Zhang Ying]'s gaze slowly extended into the distance, where birds flew through the misty sky and a ray of sunlight pierced through the clouds.
1:21:8|1:21:12|On the school playground, the children stood in formation in their school uniforms.
1:21:13|1:21:16|They were practicing martial arts diligently on the playground.
1:21:16|1:21:23|Teacher Wang stood at the front of the line, with a whistle in his mouth, while the children stood in horse stance, punching and kicking forward.
1:21:23|1:21:27|Principal Sun is supervising the children's actions in the distant queue.
1:21:27|1:21:34|Wang Chenghao, [Hu Zhi], Shou Hong, Peng Lili, and Bei Niu stood at the far left of the team, practicing martial arts together.
1:21:34|1:21:38|Several people half-squat and punch forward, then turn around in a circle before delivering a palm strike.
1:21:39|1:21:49|[Uncle Shi] stood to the side as Monk Qiu watched attentively, a pleased smile on his face. With his hands behind his back, [Uncle Shi] looked around at the children practicing martial arts.
1:21:49|1:21:57|Principal Sun glanced down slightly at the children's movements. At that moment, he looked into the distance and smiled, raising his fist in salute to [Uncle Shi].
1:21:58|1:22:8|Uncle Shi greeted Principal Sun with a fist salute, while Zhang Ying on the side also raised his fist to pay respect to the two. The children were earnestly practicing punches, learning how to kick and lift their legs.
1:22:8|1:22:26|By the coast, seagulls are pecking for food in the shallow pool, reflecting the beautiful scenery and the silhouettes of seabirds on the beach. An abandoned, broken fishing boat is stranded on the receding shore, with debris and dry grass occupying the entire ground. The sunlight casts long shadows of [Zhang Ying] and [Hu Zhi], as the two slowly walk towards the harbor.
1:22:26|1:22:29|Then they sat down.
1:22:33|1:22:35|[Zhang Ying] looked back at [Hu Zhi].
