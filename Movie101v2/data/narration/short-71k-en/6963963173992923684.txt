0:2:28|0:2:43|[Ma Jin] heard the news and couldn't help but look at the sun visor in the car. He reached out and opened the sun visor, took out the lottery ticket next to [Shanshan]'s photo, stared at the lottery ticket for a long time, and then tucked it into a book.
0:2:56|0:3:0|[Ma Jin] tried to start the engine of the vehicle upon hearing this, but to no avail.
0:4:39|0:4:46|[Ma Jin] handed out water to everyone, but his eyes were always on [Shanshan]. He quietly took out a hot drink from his pocket and handed it to [Shanshan].
0:4:55|0:5:22|He took the hot drink, gazed at it for a long time, but then handed it to the person next to him. The bus sped through the city streets, its yellow body with a small yellow duck shape standing out in the city. The bus passed through the crowds, crossed a bridge, and headed towards the port. After a crash sound, accompanied by screams from the bus, it plunged into the sea and started racing on the water.
0:6:50|0:7:9|[Manager Zhang] was giving a speech on stage, while [Ma Jin] was playing games on his phone, oblivious to everything. With a sound of passing a level, a notification popped up on his phone, informing him that he had won 60 million. Stunned and incredulous, [Ma Jin] clicked on it to confirm.
0:7:9|0:7:21|[Ma Jin] quickly took out the lottery ticket sandwiched in the book, holding the phone in one hand and the ticket in the other, comparing them word by word. His face was full of anxiety and nervousness, but his eyes dared not show any slackness.
0:8:20|0:8:42|With the words of the wanderer just spoken, [Xiao Wang] stared straight out the window, [Ma Jin] followed [Xiao Wang]'s gaze and also looked outside. The two of them had a look of fear in their eyes. When their colleagues snapped out of it, they too noticed something strange. Suddenly, towering waves rose up from the calm sea, the deep waves like a wall reaching the sky, blocking the bus's path.
0:8:50|0:8:57|[Lao Pan] took Manager Zhang's seat before he could sit down. Manager Zhang gestured for Lao Pan to return to his own seat, but Lao Pan completely ignored him.
0:8:57|0:9:18|The cargo ship, swaying in the huge waves, was about to crash into the bus. [Xiao Wang] decisively increased the throttle, maximizing the propeller horsepower. With a roar, [Xiao Wang] drove the bus towards the huge waves. The cargo ship was battered by the towering waves, people on board were thrown around, and containers fell into the sea.
0:9:18|0:9:30|The bus continued to shake violently, making it difficult for colleagues inside to control their bodies. The cargo ship, battered by huge waves, struggled to maintain stability. The oil drums on the cargo ship toppled over, triggering a series of chain explosions.
0:9:30|0:9:54|Above the sea, a fierce fire blazed. Colleagues couldn't hide their fear at the sight, but the bus, driven by [Xiao Wang], bravely plowed through the waves, navigating through the flames in search of a path to survival. The bus, with its small frame, charged towards the capsized cargo ship, entering the midst of giant waves filled with fallen containers from the ship. Explosions continued as the bus aimlessly roamed around with the shockwaves.
0:9:55|0:10:19|At this moment, a whale swam past the bus, and [Ma Jin] even made eye contact with the whale by the window. His face was full of fear, but the whale swam away on its own. However, the huge body of the whale couldn't take care of both ends, and its massive tail heavily slapped on the bus. The screams inside the bus were incessant, and the bus was pushed by the current towards the giant waves.
0:10:20|0:10:28|The bus rushed out from the top of the giant wave, with everyone on board in a state of panic. Then, as the giant wave swept down, the bus was submerged in the sea.
0:10:32|0:11:31|On the nameless deserted island. A light rain falls from the sky, a lizard lies on the green rock, tilting its head to enjoy the rain, suddenly it turns its head, as if it has discovered something. It climbs up the rock and finds the bus that has long been swallowed by the huge waves, standing alone on the rock wall. It blinks and sees Xiao Xing with his mouth open, as if calling out someone's name.
0:11:32|0:12:6|[Xiao Xing] helped [Ma Jin] up, but [Ma Jin] seemed a bit disoriented. With heavy eyes, [Ma Jin] looked around and saw some colleagues unconscious, some praying with prayer beads, and some vomiting on the ground. The bus looked particularly dilapidated in the storm. [Manager Zhang] stood on a rock wall looking helpless in the distance. As [Ma Jin] regained consciousness, he surveyed the surroundings.
0:12:6|0:12:21|Surrounded by raging waves and screams of despair, [Ma Jin] still remembered to check if his lottery ticket was safe, even in such dire circumstances.
0:12:22|0:12:31|He opened his backpack, flipped through the book, then closed it and tucked it into his arms, afraid of being seen by others.
0:12:59|0:13:11|The dark and oppressive storm clouds over the sea dyed the sky black, the raging waterspout connecting heaven and earth, accompanied by the sound of thunder and lightning, as if it were an apocalyptic scene.
0:13:11|0:13:47|The torrential rain, the size of soybeans, couldn't hide the anxiety of [Ma Jin]. [Ma Jin] shuttled through the dense forest in search of [Shanshan]'s trace. The small path washed by the rain was particularly muddy and slippery, causing [Ma Jin] to accidentally fall. However, he inadvertently saw a coat hanging on a tree branch. [Ma Jin] picked up the coat and found it belonged to [Shanshan].
0:13:48|0:13:56|Ma Jin followed the scream of Shanshan and found her sitting on a rock wall.
0:13:56|0:14:3|[Shanshan] signaled to [Ma Jin] that her foot was stuck, and [Ma Jin] struggled to move the rocks to rescue [Shanshan].
0:14:17|0:14:22|The torrential rain on the sea grew heavier and heavier, accompanied by flashes of lightning and thunder, giving a sense of apocalyptic doom.
0:14:23|0:14:50|The people on the island scattered to hide in the rock crevices to avoid the rainstorm. After a simple head count, they settled down comfortably in the rock crevices to wait out the storm.
0:14:59|0:15:18|The next day, the stranded colleagues huddled in the rock crevices, looking exhausted. [Xiao Wang] arrived and shouted twice, signaling everyone to follow him.
0:16:48|0:17:2|[Ma Jin] took out his phone, trying to check his winning information. However, as soon as he opened the app, the phone shut down due to low battery. Seeing this, [Ma Jin] was very annoyed and went to reprimand the arguing crowd.
0:17:40|0:17:44|Manager Zhang grabbed Xiao Wang by the collar in anger, glaring at him fiercely.
0:17:54|0:18:2|The appearance of the deserted island gradually revealed itself, with everyone trapped on the uninhabited island, standing alone on the sea.
0:19:32|0:19:53|[Xiao Wang] skillfully climbed up the tree, picked the fruit and threw it to the people below. On the sixth day, everyone held up makeshift signal receivers and searched around for signals. After connecting for a while, all they heard was the noisy sound of electronic waves, with no trace of any signal.
0:20:36|0:20:46|A sudden explosion caught everyone's attention, and they turned around to see that the bus was emitting black smoke.
0:20:52|0:21:0|[Xiao Wang] looked at the smoking bus, gritting his teeth in anger.
0:21:33|0:21:45|The lizard on the deserted island looked coldly at everything, with only the abandoned bus and him as lonely companions.
0:22:30|0:22:35|The security guard's impatient attitude left Manager Yu stunned, and he turned to complain to [Manager Zhang].
0:23:31|0:23:36|Shanshan's words surprised Professor, but no one in the audience refuted them.
0:23:50|0:23:55|Xiao Wang's words gave everyone hope, and they all set off to the cave with Xiao Wang.
0:23:59|0:24:6|Everyone seemed to be exhausted, only focusing on moving forward. Even saying one more word felt tiring.
0:24:15|0:24:26|Everyone felt excited, very satisfied with the internal environment, and even prepared firewood for drilling and making fire.
0:26:10|0:26:21|[Shanshan] stood alone on the cliff, gazing at the distant deep and calm sea. When [Ma Jin] arrived and saw [Shanshan] in such a posture, he stood still and did not disturb her.
0:26:22|0:26:47|[Shanshan] opened her mouth as if to vent her grievances, but before she could speak, [Ma Jin] beat her to it. Giving [Ma Jin] a disdainful look, [Shanshan] turned around to leave. Just as [Ma Jin] finished speaking, [Shanshan] shouted out and then walked away. [Ma Jin] stood there in a daze, gazing into the distance at the sea.
0:26:48|0:27:9|[Ma Jin] cautiously returned to the cave, seeing everyone already fast asleep. He tiptoed over to check on [Shanshan], only to find her leaning against a rock, using her luggage as a pillow, sound asleep. Feeling bored, he found a spot next to [Xiao Xing] and curled up to sleep.
0:27:9|0:27:17|Above the wilderness are primitive jungles, and above the jungles is the long-lasting mist that has not dissipated for many years.
0:27:42|0:27:47|[Xiao Wang] led everyone to fish, and he was seen vigorously thrusting a stick into the water.
0:27:55|0:28:20|[Ma Jin] placed the stones on the wooden stakes as markers and then quickly walked away. Climbing the rock wall was very difficult for [Manager Zhang], but [Xiao Wang] quickly climbed up, even taunting [Manager Zhang] along the way. The others also swiftly passed [Manager Zhang]. [Manager Zhang] hoped for help but only received a high-five. On the other side, [Ma Jin] was shuttling through the jungle. He was seen crossing through the dark cave with a coat covering his head.
0:28:20|0:28:40|Ma Jin crossed the deep water curtain cave, traveled on the desolate island's small plain, passed through jungles full of thorns, stepped over skinny reefs, and finally set foot on the long-lost sea cliff. Looking out, all he could see was a vast expanse of turbulent waves and the endless sea in the distance.
0:28:41|0:28:47|The next day, the persistent [Ma Jin] continued to roam around the deserted island, still searching for a way out.
0:29:13|0:29:42|Lucy almost stumbled, and grabbed [Xiao Wang] in front of her, until [Xiao Wang] felt a little embarrassed. [Ma Jin] climbed over various terrains in the jungle, trying to find a way out. He looked at the lottery ticket in his hand, and saw the 90-day redemption date starting to search for a way out on the deserted island. After finally seeing a glimmer of hope, he walked over and found it was another dead end. He suddenly realized that he was on a deserted island.
0:30:43|0:30:49|[Ma Jin] wanted to step forward and teach [Xiao Wang] a lesson, but was intimidated by Xiao Wang's imposing manner. Watching Xiao Wang acting all high and mighty, Ma Jin felt very aggrieved.
0:30:56|0:31:25|Xiao Wang pressed Ma Jin against the stove, his grimacing expression was terrifying. He looked around and with a single move, subdued Ma Jin to the ground. Everyone was frightened by Xiao Wang's words. At night, to punish Ma Jin, Xiao Wang hung him upside down on a tree. Xiao Xing sneaked out at night to look for Ma Jin.
0:31:50|0:32:6|Early in the morning, [Xiao Xing] and [Ma Jin] were planning something on the rocks. [Ma Jin] noticed that the stone he threw didn't skip, which made him pensive.
0:33:42|0:33:47|Listening to [Shanshan]'s words, [Ma Jin] was momentarily at a loss.
0:33:58|0:34:2|[Ma Jin] turned around and was about to leave quickly, but he glanced back at [Shanshan].
0:34:4|0:34:36|[Ma Jin] was unwilling in his heart, he walked quickly towards [Shanshan], attempting to force a kiss on her. [Shanshan] reached out her hand to block [Ma Jin]. The two of them were at a standstill. Seeing this, [Ma Jin] kissed [Shanshan]'s fingers. [Shanshan] immediately felt disgusted, quickly letting go of [Ma Jin]. [Shanshan] crossed her arms defensively, looking at [Ma Jin]. [Ma Jin] glanced at [Shanshan] and took out a packet of instant noodles from his bag to give to her.
0:34:45|0:35:2|As soon as the words fell, [Ma Jin] picked up his bag and left. [Ma Jin] and [Xiao Xing] paddled the boat with all their strength, standing on the rocks, watching [Ma Jin] sail away.
0:35:28|0:35:40|[Ma Jin] rowed the boat, his foot accidentally fell into the water. When he lifted his foot, he realized his shoe was missing. [Ma Jin] searched around in the water for his shoe, but he couldn't find it.
0:35:42|0:35:53|At night, [Ma Jin] and [Xiao Xing] were drifting alone on the sea in a small boat. The next day, just as the sky was getting light, [Xiao Xing] seemed to have discovered something.
0:35:59|0:36:18|He paddled hard to bring the boat closer to the floating object, used the oar to push the object, and found it was a dead polar bear. [Ma Jin] and [Xiao Xing] stared in shock at the polar bear.
0:36:57|0:37:2|[Xiao Wang] finished scolding [Ma Jin] and then turned around and left. The rest of the people started mocking [Ma Jin].
0:37:48|0:38:30|[Ma Jin] exerted all his strength to throw [Xiao Xing] against the rock wall. [Xiao Xing] wiped the blood from his nose and ignored [Ma Jin]. Feeling wronged, [Xiao Xing] looked at the unfamiliar [Ma Jin] and didn't know what to say. As [Ma Jin] finished speaking, [Xiao Xing] got up and walked away from him.
0:39:4|0:39:30|[Manager Zhang] stood away from the crowd, alone, took out his wallet, gently looked down at the photo of his wife and child in the wallet. The sea breeze lightly brushed his face, as if making a decision for him. [Manager Zhang] took out the money from the wallet without any hesitation and scattered it into the air. The money flew around with the sea breeze, but at this moment, money and status held no allure. Everyone just watched, gazing silently as the money scattered in the wind.
0:39:51|0:40:8|Faced with Ma Jin's call, Xiao Xing walked away without looking back. Ma Jin felt dejected and lowered his head to work on the shoes. Shanshan walked over and handed him a piece of cloth to secure them.
0:40:48|0:40:55|Manager Zhang and Ma Jin were wandering aimlessly in the jungle.
0:42:55|0:43:6|Manager Zhang finished speaking, his gaze sweeping around the crowd.
0:44:20|0:44:30|[Manager Zhang]'s impassioned speech inspired everyone, and [Ma Jin] led the applause.
0:45:1|0:45:11|[Professor] was busy eating on the side and ignored [Xiao Wang]. His mouth was full of food and he couldn't speak, which angered [Xiao Wang].
0:45:24|0:45:31|Manager Zhang nodded and looked around.
0:45:35|0:45:48|Manager Zhang raised his hand as soon as he finished speaking, and like-minded people also raised their hands one after another. Professor raised his hand, then touched his head and put it down.
0:46:24|0:46:32|Late at night, [Manager Zhang] led everyone through the woods with a torch, [Ma Jin] couldn't help but feel doubtful.
0:46:36|0:46:44|[Ma Jin] and his group were holding torches as they passed through the rocky beach. It seemed like [Ma Jin] had discovered something.
0:46:54|0:47:17|Manager Zhang gestured with his hand to signal Ma Jin not to linger any longer. The black night bestowed a deathly silence upon the jungle of the deserted island, and the dazzling torches stood out particularly in the deep night.
0:47:17|0:47:31|The torches dispersed the deathly silence of the night, and [Ma Jin] and his group pushed through the mist in the jungle. As the mist cleared, they finally reached the end of their journey.
0:47:31|0:47:45|[Ma Jin] and his group walked down the stairs into the cabin, where the dim torchlight dispelled the unknown for everyone, allowing [Ma Jin] and his group to explore the full view of the cabin.
0:48:9|0:48:16|[Ma Jin] found a shoe in the cabin, which made him particularly happy.
0:48:54|0:49:8|The next day, with the waves gently lapping the beach and the sea breeze brushing the weeds growing on the deck, [Ma Jin] and [Xiao Xing] rubbed their sleepy eyes and walked out of the cabin, finally able to explore the full view of the cabin.
0:49:16|0:49:41|Originally, it was a half-ship stranded and overturned on the shore, resembling a huge fortress. [Ma Jin] and [Xiao Xing] walked along the shallows with wooden sticks, stabbing at the fish in the water. They drove the fish towards the fishing net that had been set up ahead. When the net was pulled up, the two of them harvested a net full of fish. [Ma Jin] couldn't help but sing excitedly.
0:50:30|0:50:39|[Ma Jin] and [Xiao Xing] playfully frolic on the beach, watching the sunset.
0:50:49|0:50:57|[Shanshan] struggled to lift the fish trap out of the water, only to find it full of fish, getting wet in the rain.
0:51:6|0:51:14|Ma Jin's sudden appearance made Shanshan understand where the fish came from. She looked up at Ma Jin.
0:52:19|0:52:34|[Ma Jin] took [Shanshan] to the cabin to take a bath. Watching [Shanshan] grooming in front of the mirror, she looked at herself in the mirror and applied lipstick.
0:53:23|0:53:35|Shanshan was shouting loudly on the deck, while Ma Jin was standing beside her, looking at her tenderly as if wanting to see forever.
0:53:45|0:53:56|[Shanshan] lights a lighter for [Ma Jin], who has already changed into his costume and is humming a rhythm to dance with [Shanshan], who is also very happy.
0:55:0|0:55:9|[Ma Jin] watched as [Shanshan] walked away, extinguishing the lighter in his hand. Little did he know that [Manager Zhang] would reignite it.
0:55:46|0:55:52|Xiao Wang tasted a glass of wine in the cabin.
0:59:11|0:59:37|[Ma Jin] took out the card that Manager [Zhang] had just given him. In the end, he threw the card on the ground and walked away without looking back. [Zhang] and Manager Yu picked up the card, watching [Ma Jin] and [Xiao Xing] walk away. [Zhang] watched as [Ma Jin] and [Xiao Xing] walked further and further away.
0:59:39|0:59:49|On the deserted island, a stream flows horizontally, [Ma Jin] sits alone on the rocky beach, looking even older.
0:59:54|1:0:7|[Xiao Xing] finished tidying up the cabin, looked at [Ma Jin] who was staring blankly at the rocky beach, [Ma Jin] glanced at the redemption date on the lottery ticket, and casually tore off a calendar page.
1:0:12|1:0:28|Life on the island was particularly decadent. Apart from sitting paralyzed in bed, [Ma Jin] either went fishing or tore off another page from the calendar.
1:0:35|1:0:57|Manager Zhang and Manager Yu were laughing loudly on the deck with their wine glasses, while the others were busy tidying up the fishing nets and drying the freshly caught fish. Ma Jin was hiding in the distant forest, watching Shanshan washing clothes in the stream. Ma Jin pursed his lips, looking hesitant and conflicted. The days on the calendar were rapidly decreasing, and in the blink of an eye, ten days had disappeared without a trace.
1:0:57|1:1:20|Life on the deserted island remained unchanged, with the waves still surging relentlessly day after day against the shore. [Ma Jin] and [Xiao Xing] still hadn't found a way out, standing on the rocks in the waves, watching the rushing waves. Days flew by rapidly, as [Ma Jin] watched the calendar pages being torn off one by one.
1:1:29|1:1:42|Days passed by, [Ma Jin] tore off the calendar pages one by one. As the deadline for claiming the prize approached, [Ma Jin] stood by the seaside and shouted in despair, with only [Xiao Xing] by his side.
1:1:52|1:1:58|[Ma Jin] and [Xiao Xing] step back onto [Manager Zhang]'s territory, attracting the attention of everyone present.
1:2:22|1:2:28|Hearing Xiao Xing's words, Manager Zhang pretended to be surprised, and after some contemplation, he agreed to him.
1:2:37|1:2:42|[Ma Jin] got up from the ground and demanded a fishing net from Manager Yu.
1:2:54|1:3:6|[Ma Jin] reached out and slapped Yang Hong, who got angry and directly hit [Ma Jin] to the ground. Yang Hong took a step forward, only to be punched back by [Ma Jin].
1:3:6|1:3:14|Manager Zhang in the distance looked coldly at everything while holding a glass of wine. Xiao Xing suddenly appeared and gave Yang Hong a blow.
1:3:24|1:3:30|Manager Zhang stood in the distance holding a glass of wine, watching everything. Xiao Xing collapsed on the ground, while Ma Jin tried to take him away.
1:3:43|1:4:1|[Ma Jin] leaned heavily on a tree stump with numerous injuries, while [Xiao Xing] weakly opened his eyes beside him. [Ma Jin] was panting heavily with blood in his mouth, looking disheveled and exhausted, turning his tired eyes to gaze at Manager Zhang in the distance.
1:4:1|1:4:35|He saw Shanshan talking to Manager Zhang and boarding the cabin with him. Ma Jin couldn't help but recall what he had said before. At this moment, Ma Jin felt a deep pain, watching Shanshan enter the cabin, reminiscing about their past together. Ma Jin was heartbroken, unable to say a word.
1:4:35|1:4:58|At night, [Ma Jin] and [Xiao Xing] returned to their residence. Suddenly, they noticed some movement outside and immediately picked up stones and wooden sticks, ready to attack. To their surprise, the person who arrived was [Shanshan].
1:4:58|1:5:2|[Ma Jin] let down his guard,
1:5:16|1:5:24|Shanshan looked speechless, then took out a fish from her bag and placed it on the rock in front of Ma Jin.
1:5:39|1:5:51|Shanshan suddenly felt wronged, staring straight at Ma Jin, who remained silent. In annoyance, Shanshan directly threw the bag at Ma Jin and left without looking back.
1:5:52|1:6:7|[Ma Jin] shook his head indifferently, then stood up and threw the bag into the river. [Xiao Xing] felt helpless as he saw the fish being thrown away.
1:6:14|1:6:23|Days passed by, [Ma Jin] lay on the rocks, covered in wounds, with cracked lips, looking like a dying man.
1:6:23|1:6:31|Today is the last day to claim the prize, [Ma Jin] looks blankly at the sky.
1:6:52|1:7:23|[Ma Jin] seemed to not hear anything, staring blankly at the lottery ticket in his hand. Suddenly, a fish hit the ground in front of [Ma Jin]. He stared at the fish on the ground in a daze, and then it started raining from the sky. Another fish fell in front of [Ma Jin]. He looked up at the sky and realized more and more fish were falling towards him. As the rain intensified and more fish fell, [Ma Jin] struggled to dodge the fish attacks. However, the falling fish were as dense as raindrops, leaving [Ma Jin] and the other person on the rocky beach with no way to escape.
1:7:23|1:7:43|The two were brutally beaten by the falling fish, struggling to move their bodies to find a place to hide from this fish disaster. Unexpectedly, before they could find shelter, they were knocked down by the falling fish on the rocky beach. The two curled up on the rocky beach, as if they were about to give up struggling. However, the falling fish did not stop there, instead of rain, they turned the sky into their own arena.
1:7:43|1:7:48|[Ma Jin] looked at the fish falling from the sky, unable to see the rain anymore, letting the fish hit him.
1:7:48|1:7:56|[Ma Jin] and [Shanshan] curled up on the rocky beach, having long given up any struggle, blending in with the rocks and the stranded fish.
1:7:57|1:8:5|After a long time, the torrential rain stopped abruptly. [Ma Jin] stood up again, looking at the fish scattered on the rocky beach and the torn lottery tickets.
1:8:5|1:8:10|[Ma Jin] was speechless, unsure whether to be happy or sad.
1:8:10|1:8:22|While Ma Jin was in a daze, Xiao Xing had already piled up the fish into a small mountain and started grilling them over the fire. Xiao Xing stuffed the grilled fish into his mouth in big bites, seeking to avenge the beating he received.
1:8:22|1:8:44|On the other hand, [Ma Jin] had a poor appetite. Standing up and looking around, all [Ma Jin] could see were the fallen fish covering the rocky beach and the piles of fallen fish stacked up by [Xiao Xing]. The place where [Ma Jin] and [Xiao Xing] sought refuge had already been taken over by fallen fish. It was unclear whose territory it was, leaving [Ma Jin] feeling both joy and sorrow at the same time.
1:11:6|1:11:24|[Ma Jin] tiptoed to the side of the bathroom, hesitating on how to speak up. [Ma Jin] pretended to be calm as he glanced at the bathroom.
1:11:33|1:11:54|[Ma Jin] fidgeted with his coat outside the bathroom, looking as nervous as a maiden. He carried two buckets of water and poured them into the water tank in the bathroom, only to hear a cry of surprise from [Shanshan].
1:12:22|1:12:30|Suddenly, the door of the bathroom opened, but the person who walked out was not [Shanshan].
1:12:48|1:12:56|Ma Jin, who had come to his senses, turned around to look at the bathroom, but did not find any trace of Shanshan. Shanshan was staring at him on the rock wall.
1:12:56|1:13:7|Shanshan stood on the cliff, looking at Ma Jin with a surprised expression. A long-lost smile appeared on her face. The deserted island was still shrouded in mist, and life showed no signs of improvement.
1:15:12|1:15:20|Xiao Wang looked at Manager Zhang's arrogant face, feeling a surge of courage. Suddenly, he gritted his teeth and made a swift move like a carp leaping over the dragon gate.
1:15:23|1:15:31|With a command from [Xiao Wang], a battle for resources erupted on the rocky beach, and the two sides instantly engaged in a fierce struggle for scarce survival resources.
1:15:42|1:15:54|Shanshan searched everywhere but couldn't find Ma Jin's whereabouts. Little did she know that Ma Jin and Xiao Xing were watching the team battle from a distance on the rocky beach. The battle on the rocky beach intensified, with both sides fighting fiercely for survival, unwilling to back down.
1:16:1|1:16:7|Yang Hong was unfortunately subdued. Manager Zhang saw the situation was not good, so he quickly fled into the cabin with Lao Pan.
1:16:7|1:16:14|Manager Zhang saw the cabin door open, but unexpectedly Lao Pan went in first and closed the door, leaving Manager Zhang all alone outside.
1:16:16|1:16:22|Manager Zhang angrily pounded on the cabin door, but there was no sign of it opening.
1:16:22|1:16:34|[Xiao Wang] grabbed [Manager Zhang] by the back of his neck and pushed him to the ground. The fierce battle on the rocky beach continued, with both sides seemingly having a deep-seated hatred, making every move ruthless.
1:16:44|1:16:51|Above the sky, the wind and clouds change constantly, day and night rotate, the great battle continues into the night without stopping.
1:16:51|1:17:3|At this moment, [Shanshan] rushed back and attempted to intervene but was overturned and fell to the ground. A fierce battle ensued, with everyone seeming like madmen, grappling on the rocky beach.
1:17:6|1:17:16|Suddenly, a beam of bright light lit up on the spaceship, waking up everyone on the rocky beach. People shielded their eyes from the dazzling light, trying to see where it was coming from, only to find themselves in front of the lamp.
1:17:26|1:17:34|[Xiao Xing] vigorously shakes the generator next to [Ma Jin].
1:20:40|1:21:4|The midnight bell rang, and the violence on the rocky beach had ceased. Everyone gathered together to cook instant noodles. [Ma Jin] tore open the seasoning packet and sprinkled it into the pot. The powder scattered in the blowing steam, but no one felt the sting in their noses. They still gazed at the floating dust in the air, watching the boiling noodle soup in the pot. When the noodles were cooked and the pot boiled, [Ma Jin] was the first to pick up a strand of noodles with chopsticks.
1:21:4|1:21:10|The crowd watched as Ma Jin lifted the steaming noodles, a happy smile on his face.
1:21:10|1:21:27|[Ma Jin] packed instant noodles for everyone, ladled hot soup into a bowl, and handed it to the dejected [Xiao Wang] on the side, reuniting everyone once again. [Xiao Wang] took the noodles, bowed his head, took a bite, and a tear rolled down his cheek.
1:21:37|1:21:50|[Ma Jin] led the applause, and everyone couldn't help but burst into tears when they heard this, holding their heads and crying bitterly, each one louder than the last. It seemed as if this was to announce the end of the factional struggles on the deserted island, bringing everyone back together.
1:21:50|1:22:14|At this moment, [Shanshan] was looking at [Ma Jin] who was serving noodles to everyone with great concentration. She quickly walked to the noodle pot and served a bowl of noodles for the busy [Ma Jin]. [Ma Jin] also noticed [Shanshan]'s actions, and she immediately handed the bowl and fork to [Ma Jin]. [Ma Jin] took it and looked at [Shanshan] with a smile in his eyes. [Shanshan] also smiled back at [Ma Jin] in response.
1:23:4|1:23:20|The longing of everyone is hard to contain, they all cling to [Ma Jin], wanting to catch a glimpse of their family. [Xiao Xing] shakes the generator to charge the phones. Everyone forms a long line outside the cabin, just to see their family.
1:23:28|1:23:40|Life on the deserted island gradually improved, with the men starting to bathe in the pond. When [Sister Qi] arrived, everyone was caught off guard and quickly hid behind rocks in the water, afraid to show themselves.
1:23:42|1:23:48|[Shanshan] and the sisters are tidying up the sun-drenched sheets.
1:23:56|1:24:5|[Lucy] is wearing a deep V-neck top while jumping rope, her figure bouncing up and down with the movement, revealing everything. This scene catches the attention of the male survivors on the deserted island.
1:24:5|1:24:24|In the forest, towering trees collapsed one by one, and [Ma Jin] and the others started a civil engineering project. They were seen energetically swinging their axes, while [Ma Jin] was busy rescuing the bus. He looked at the simple blueprint in his hand, trying to set up a wooden frame next to the bus and use the lever principle to rescue the bus from the encirclement of the rocks.
1:24:25|1:24:47|[Lao Pan], who was just shocked and injured by electricity, regained consciousness and waved his hands randomly as he emerged from the water. [Ma Jin] stood by, watching all this with relief. As the project came to an end, everyone gathered in groups of three or four, either standing, sitting, or leaning against the banyan tree, chatting and enjoying themselves.
1:24:47|1:24:55|[Ma Jin] and [Shanshan] were enjoying their own world, while [Manager Zhang] and his small group were gazing at the sea, comforting themselves.
1:24:55|1:25:11|On the deserted island, everyone made the best of a bad situation and started skipping rope together. While others were playing, [Xiao Xing] was moving stones by the stream to control the water flow. He also used scrap iron pieces to make a water wheel, successfully developing a simple water-powered generator that illuminated the pitch-black night.
1:25:12|1:25:26|As the music plays, everyone gathers around the bonfire and dances with abandon, cheering and laughing, enjoying the whole night. Even [Xiao Wang] and [Manager Zhang], who are usually at odds, embrace each other and dance gracefully.
1:25:26|1:25:34|[Xiao Xing] is also dancing on the deck, shouting and venting the frustration of the past few days.
1:25:49|1:26:12|[Ma Jin] and [Xiao Xing] lazily leaned against the boat, watching the people dancing below. [Manager Zhang] hurriedly walked up to [Xiao Xing], only to see him throwing a playing card towards him. This unexpected scene caused a commotion among the crowd. [Xiao Xing] picked up more cards and threw them down.
1:26:23|1:26:46|[Ma Jin] stood up, stood at the edge of the boat with his back facing outwards. He opened his arms and shouted loudly before falling backwards. The people below went even more crazy, reaching out their hands to welcome the falling [Ma Jin].
1:26:49|1:26:54|The party ended, and everyone gathered together to watch a long-lost movie.
1:27:14|1:27:28|After Professor Shi finished showing the cone diagram to everyone, Manager Zhang was not convinced, but still took out a deck of cards and handed it to Xiao Xing.
1:27:57|1:28:6|Hearing Ma Jin's words, Shanshan couldn't help but applaud. In the dreamlike forest, there were only Shanshan and Ma Jin, walking through the woods on the moss.
1:28:27|1:28:46|[Shanshan], wearing a flower crown, looked affectionately at [Ma Jin]. She reached out her hand to [Ma Jin], her smile becoming brighter and brighter. Suddenly, behind [Shanshan], colorful and translucent wings spread open, and [Ma Jin] stared at her, becoming more and more mesmerized. The sound of a drop of water falling into a pool startled [Ma Jin].
1:28:46|1:28:55|[Ma Jin] looked at [Shanshan], who was entangled with him, and couldn't help but feel stunned.
1:29:12|1:29:30|Facing Shanshan's inquiry, Ma Jin just waved his hand, still smiling at Shanshan, with laughter and music continuing, the party has not stopped, Ma Jin is falling.
1:29:32|1:29:36|The crowd had already extended their hands waiting for the arrival of [Ma Jin].
1:29:36|1:29:59|[Ma Jin] also joined the crowd in the celebration, intensifying the atmosphere. He even lifted [Shanshan] up, while [Xiao Wang] was wrapped in light strips, twisting his body. On the side, [Manager Zhang] was smoking a cigar, holding a glass of wine and dancing to the music. [Ma Jin] and [Xiao Xing] got more and more excited as they played, and the two of them even started a duet dance.
1:29:59|1:30:13|[Manager Zhang] completely abandoned his image, bowing his body and shaking his head. Suddenly, a heavy roar interrupted everyone's revelry.
1:30:28|1:30:34|Xiao Wang, wrapped in fairy lights, rushed to the front, followed by Ma Jin and Xiao Xing.
1:31:6|1:31:34|[Ma Jin] and [Xiao Xing] arrived at the edge of the cliff. It seemed like [Xiao Xing] had discovered something. They looked at something on the edge of the cliff, and the roaring sound echoed again. [Ma Jin] saw a brightly lit cruise ship sailing on the sea, with dazzling fireworks on board, indicating the presence of light.
1:31:49|1:31:57|[Xiao Wang]'s hoarse shout was in vain,
1:32:16|1:32:25|[Ma Jin] looked at the ship with a strange expression, holding a tree branch and randomly chopping around, venting his anger.
1:32:30|1:32:39|[Ma Jin] looked ferocious, spitting saliva towards the sky.
1:32:49|1:33:11|[Ma Jin] angrily curses the heavens, looking at the dazzling cruise ship with a deeply despondent expression. [Xiao Xing] remains silent by his side for a long time, as the fireworks on the cruise ship do not stop despite his outburst. [Ma Jin] walks away in loneliness.
1:33:36|1:33:58|[Ma Jin] stood still after saying these words, unsure of what to do next. [Xiao Xing] gazed in the direction where [Xiao Wang] had disappeared, with a determined look in his eyes. Suddenly, [Xiao Xing] briskly approached [Ma Jin], lifting his head that had been lowered for a long time. The expression on [Xiao Xing]'s face was particularly cold and, under the moonlight, appeared exceptionally fierce.
1:35:44|1:35:51|[Xiao Wang] looked around at everyone who remained unmoved.
1:36:32|1:36:40|[Xiao Xing] signaled everyone to subdue the crazed [Xiao Wang].
1:36:52|1:36:59|Everyone in the cabin chased after the fleeing Xiao Wang and together they locked him in the refrigerator.
1:37:8|1:37:18|[Xiao Xing] quickly brought the stun gun over and connected it to the refrigerator. After opening the refrigerator, [Xiao Wang] immediately fainted to the ground.
1:38:29|1:38:39|[Shanshan] looked at [Ma Jin] beside her, but couldn't give a reply.
1:39:3|1:39:7|After Shanshan finished speaking, she broke free from Ma Jin's hand and left, leaving Ma Jin standing in place.
1:39:11|1:39:33|Late at night, the bus stood alone on the rocks, looking particularly lonely. [Ma Jin] came to the rocks alone, staring at the bus in a daze. Suddenly, lightning flashed across the sky, followed by cold raindrops. [Ma Jin] continued to gaze at the bus in front of him, lost in thought.
1:39:35|1:39:40|Time flies, and now it has been 132 days since Ma Jin arrived on the island.
1:41:23|1:41:41|Upon hearing Manager Zhang's words, Xiao Xing couldn't help but sneer and took out his phone.
1:43:22|1:43:38|[Ma Jin] looked at [Xiao Xing]'s expression, not knowing how to advise him. Manager [Zhang] quickly prepared the contract, stamped it, and handed it to [Xiao Xing]. [Xiao Xing] then took out his phone to start recording.
1:43:58|1:44:4|Feeling particularly unfamiliar, [Xiao Xing] received the contract and immediately handed the phone to [Manager Zhang].
1:44:34|1:44:43|[Ma Jin] didn't know how to refute it after hearing that.
1:45:0|1:45:10|[Ma Jin] looked at the unfamiliar face of [Xiao Xing], hesitated for a long time, and opened his mouth.
1:45:50|1:46:2|[Ma Jin] looked at the unusually indifferent [Xiao Xing], but couldn't say a word.
1:46:6|1:46:13|[Xiao Xing] finished speaking and left, leaving [Ma Jin] standing there in a daze.
1:46:21|1:46:32|Suddenly, [Ma Jin] was blindfolded with a sheet and taken away from the scene.
1:46:39|1:47:5|[Ma Jin] was being carried and started to move. Through the gap in the sheets, he saw himself being carried to a rocky beach. He struggled frantically, trying to break free from the people around him, but was pressed directly onto the sofa on the rocky beach. His expression in the sheets was particularly fearful. Suddenly, the sheets were lifted, and [Shanshan] rushed in. [Ma Jin] couldn't help but widen his eyes.
1:47:30|1:47:40|[Ma Jin] heard tears flowing uncontrollably from the corners of his eyes, while [Shanshan] lifted the blanket to reveal her love to everyone.
1:48:21|1:48:29|Ma Jin stood there in a daze.
1:48:34|1:48:48|Seeing that [Ma Jin] did not respond, everyone pulled up [Ma Jin], lifted him and [Shanshan] high up, but [Ma Jin]'s expression was ambiguous, neither smiling nor frowning.
1:49:24|1:49:31|[Ma Jin] rolled around on the rocky beach, shouting nonsensically.
1:50:45|1:51:12|[Lao Pan] grabbed [Ma Jin] trying to subdue him, the security guards quickly came forward and stunned both [Ma Jin] and Lao Pan. [Ma Jin] lay weakly on the rocky beach, while [Xiao Xing] watched coldly. When [Ma Jin] woke up by the river, [Xiao Wang] even threw stones at him, teasing him.
1:51:25|1:51:36|Ma Jin, who came to his senses, tried to return to the cabin but was stopped.
1:52:12|1:52:39|[Ma Jin] and [Sister Qi]'s conversation was unexpectedly seen by [Xiao Xing]. Days passed by, the waves still washed the shore day after day. [Ma Jin] still had a dull look, showing no interest in anything. He continued to sit around the island in a daze. However, the flame of hope in [Shanshan]'s heart was still burning. She couldn't let go of [Ma Jin] and came specially to seek confirmation.
1:53:18|1:53:39|[Ma Jin] responded to [Shanshan]'s questions with a big laugh, refusing to answer while laughing uncontrollably. [Ma Jin] kept laughing loudly to cover up his sense of helplessness.
1:54:22|1:54:36|[Ma Jin] and [Xiao Xing]'s conversation was seen by [Xiao Wang],
1:54:52|1:54:59|Late at night, a party is held again on the rocky beach, with [Xiao Wang] and [Ma Jin] performing a lion dance together.
1:55:51|1:56:7|Taking advantage of the crowd's excitement, [Xiao Wang] sneaked into the cabin and used an axe to smash the oil pipe of the ship.
1:57:45|1:57:51|[Xiao Wang] desperately tried to ignite the crude oil with a lighter, but the lighter just wouldn't spark.
1:58:29|1:58:41|Ma Jin was surrounded by everyone on the rocky beach, trying to snatch the torch from him. Suddenly, Xiao Wang leaped out from the side and grabbed the torch, but he was also surrounded by everyone.
1:58:46|1:58:57|Ma Jin, who managed to break free, cooperated with Xiao Wang to move through the crowd. Ma Jin took a sip of strong liquor and sprayed it onto the torch, igniting a fierce fire to disperse the crowd.
1:58:57|1:59:6|[Xiao Xing] took the opportunity to pull [Ma Jin] to his side and questioned him.
1:59:24|1:59:38|[Ma Jin] stole a book from [Xiao Xing]'s bag while distracting, meanwhile [Xiao Wang] waved a torch trying to set the ship on fire. The torch with a long tail landed at [Shanshan]'s feet.
1:59:59|2:0:11|Shanshan handed the torch to the ship as soon as she spoke, causing everyone to scream in horror. Unfortunately, fate intervened as the torch fell into the water and extinguished.
2:0:20|2:0:26|[Manager Zhang] walked out of the cabin with a cigar in his mouth, causing everyone to scream again.
2:0:37|2:0:53|[Ma Jin] picked up the stun gun, and before Manager Zhang could finish speaking, he was already trembling. The cigar in his hand fell onto the deck. The fierce fire scared off the crowd, but Xiao Xing still stepped forward to fight Ma Jin for the book.
2:0:58|2:1:21|[Xiao Xing] hoarsely roared, looking like a madman. [Ma Jin] took the opportunity to push [Xiao Xing] down, quickly stepped onto the ship's stairs, and then threw the book into the flames. The book was seen shuttling rapidly in the flames as if trying to avoid the flames' destruction. However, the flames had already taken over the surrounding space. Only a heavy landing sound was heard as the book fell onto the flames.
2:1:21|2:1:32|Engulfed in flames in an instant, [Xiao Xing] saw his books burning, unable to bear the grief. He could only be heard shouting loudly, as he tried to rush into the flames to save the books.
2:1:32|2:1:52|[Ma Jin] saw [Xiao Xing] about to rush into the flames, hurriedly hugged the crazed [Xiao Xing]. He heard [Xiao Xing] roaring loudly, swinging his arms wildly towards the flames, looking extremely ferocious. Unable to break free from [Ma Jin]'s hold, [Xiao Xing] could only watch helplessly as his beloved books were consumed by the flames.
2:1:52|2:1:59|[Xiao Xing] saw the books turning into ashes, feeling a sense of unwillingness in his heart, and his roar became even sharper.
2:1:59|2:2:10|As the fire on the ship grew larger and spread wider, everyone picked up buckets to join the firefighting efforts, but it was already too late to save the ship.
2:2:11|2:2:38|At this time, the fire-fighting efforts were minimal, and the incoming ship was engulfed by flames. The sorrow in everyone's hearts was hard to conceal as they sat paralyzed on the rocky beach, crying uncontrollably, feeling that their lives would be reduced to ashes by this raging fire. They all shifted their resentment and anger onto [Ma Jin]. The flames shot up into the sky, illuminating the pitch-black night, but the people felt no warmth, only bone-chilling cold.
2:2:49|2:2:57|[Ma Jin] was wandering around in the jungle in a panic, but ended up forcing himself to the edge of a cliff. With his own inertia still present, [Ma Jin] unfortunately slipped and fell off the cliff.
2:2:57|2:3:9|Falling, [Ma Jin] saw the explosion caused by the burning ship on one side, with flames soaring into the sky, lighting up the night sky, and also saw the ship approaching on the sea.
2:3:9|2:3:16|A towering fire caught the attention of the ship. A spotlight shone on Ma Jin's face on the ship.
2:3:16|2:3:25|[Ma Jin] saw the situation and performed a diving motion in the air. With a thud, [Ma Jin] fell into the water contentedly.
2:3:31|2:3:40|[Ma Jin] immersed himself in the sea, recalling the past life on the island, reminiscing about the smiles of everyone, his mind filled with the laughter of each person.
2:3:40|2:3:47|[Ma Jin] gradually fell silent in the sea, but his face still beamed with a satisfied smile.
2:4:32|2:4:41|[Ma Jin] opened his arms and enjoyed everything in the embrace of the sea, intoxicated and gradually losing consciousness.
2:4:41|2:5:25|The next day, [Ma Jin] lay limp on the shore. With the gentle touch of the waves, he opened his eyes, gradually regaining consciousness. He struggled to regain control of his body, forcing himself to stand up again despite his exhaustion. He dragged his heavy feet back to the ship, only to find it had long disappeared, leaving behind wreckage to indicate its past existence. The sudden sound of falling rocks caught [Ma Jin]'s attention.
2:5:27|2:5:54|[Ma Jin] looked up and saw [Shanshan] sitting on a rock, staring at him. On the deserted island, [Ma Jin] looked at [Shanshan] in a disheveled state, and they gazed at each other.
