0:0:37|0:0:44|The film begins with a group of adorable puppies eagerly nursing from their mother.
0:0:44|0:0:45|They are little Labradors.
0:0:45|0:0:49|The Labrador Retriever is one of the smartest dogs in the world.
0:0:49|0:0:55|The puppies gradually grew up, lined up in a row, happily eating the dog food in their bowls.
0:0:56|0:1:0|On the far end of a row of puppies is our protagonist, [Xiao Q].
0:1:0|0:1:5|He wears a red collar and has a gray birthmark in the shape of a seagull on his stomach.
0:1:5|0:1:11|Obviously, [Chen Qi] is still very unfamiliar with this world, he likes to run around the house and look around.
0:1:11|0:1:19|He ran to the window, looked through the glass, and saw Mr. Li Baoting and his sister Li Baoer walking towards the door.
0:1:20|0:1:24|Mr. Li Baoting was still holding a cake in his hand, and Chen Qi looked a bit puzzled.
0:1:24|0:1:27|The female host Jessica opens the door, and the two warmly greet each other.
0:1:32|0:1:35|Male protagonist Ryan also warmly welcomed them.
0:1:55|0:1:55|Mr. Li Baoting is very angry.
0:2:10|0:2:16|Ryan took everyone to the garden outside and opened the cake box, revealing a delicate cream cake inside.
0:2:34|0:2:38|Ran gestured to [Li Baoer] to calm down Mr. [Li Baoting].
0:2:38|0:2:45|Little Q ran to the second-floor balcony and, through the cracks in the railing, saw Mr. [Li Baoting] and his sister sitting on the sofa in the garden.
0:2:47|0:2:53|Mr. Li Baoting took the red wine bottle, his right hand holding the bottle slightly trembling.
0:2:53|0:2:57|Not long ago, his vision began to deteriorate, and he could only see blurry lights.
0:2:57|0:3:1|Pouring himself a drink, he then struggled to pour some into his sister's glass.
0:3:6|0:3:8|He then raised his glass.
0:3:10|0:3:15|Due to poor visibility, Li Baoting accidentally knocked over his wine glass, spilling red wine onto his pants.
0:3:33|0:3:36|Qiao Qiao watched from the balcony, while squeezing through the gap in the railing.
0:3:36|0:3:49|Suddenly, he fell out from the crevice and landed right in the arms of [Li Baoting], who held him tightly.
0:3:49|0:3:54|[Li Baoting] was very indifferent, groping forward.
0:3:54|0:3:56|Little Qi looked at him, his eyes filled with innocence.
0:4:6|0:4:12|A car pulled up in front of Run's house, with "International Guide Dog Association" written on the side.
0:4:12|0:4:22|[Simon] and Bishan got out of the car.
0:4:22|0:4:29|Inside the house, the little dogs have made a mess. Jessica is carefully taking care of the little dogs, but facing so many mischievous little dogs.
0:4:33|0:4:36|Xiao Q ran out, with Simon and Luliao Bishan following Ryan in.
0:4:42|0:4:47|[Simon] and [Luliao Bishan] pick up one small dog after another and put them into cages.
0:4:54|0:4:58|Little Q was still playing with the ball under the table when he was picked up by [Simon].
0:5:8|0:5:14|[Ryan] and [Jessica] looked on, feeling a bit reluctant to leave.
0:5:14|0:5:21|Chen Qi was locked in a cage and he will go to the guide dog association with his partners for training.
0:5:21|0:5:25|The scene shifts to the Guide Dog Association holding a ceremony for guide dog foster families.
0:5:26|0:5:27|Little Q was placed in the arms of a young girl.
0:6:3|0:6:7|The little girl kisses Chen Qi, who happily licks her face.
0:6:7|0:6:10|Xiao Q followed [Chen Zhiqiao] and her family to her new home.
0:6:10|0:6:16|She brought little Qi into the bedroom again.
0:6:51|0:6:55|A teddy bear dog came down from upstairs and ran to [Chen Zhiqiao]'s side.
0:7:2|0:7:5|[Chen Qi] friendly licked [Ma Dongmei].
0:7:5|0:7:8|At night, only [Chen Qi] was seen crouching in the doghouse.
0:7:16|0:7:19|At night, [Chen Qi] is comfortably settled in his own little nest.
0:7:21|0:7:29|[Donggu] was called away by [Chen Zhiqiao].
0:7:34|0:7:38|Before long, [Chen Zhiqiao] walked out of the bedroom again.
0:7:38|0:7:40|He is holding a glowing crystal ball in his hand.
0:7:40|0:7:43|He placed the crystal ball next to [Chen Qi].
0:7:51|0:8:3|Under the warm lights of Starlight Inn, [Chen Zhiqiao] fell asleep quietly.
0:8:3|0:8:13|From then on, [Li Baoer] and [Chen Zhiqiao] became inseparable good buddies, doing everything together.
0:8:13|0:8:15|[Li Baoting] and Chen Qi are napping together on the bed.
0:8:17|0:8:29|[Li Baoting] was reading a book, with Xiao Q and Donggu accompanying him.
0:8:29|0:8:31|They often play in the garden.
0:8:31|0:8:40|[Li Baoting]'s bubbles blew out, emitting colorful light under the sunlight, falling little by little around Chen Zhiqiao.
0:8:40|0:8:43|One day it was raining, [Li Baoting], friends, and Little Q took shelter under a rock.
0:8:51|0:9:4|In the pouring rain, the children happily swing on the swings, with Li Baoer also sitting on one. They then climb up the slide together and slide down quickly.
0:9:4|0:9:10|They turned around and returned home, with [Chen Kangyaner] giving Little Q an injection, causing Little Q to shiver with eyes closed.
0:9:14|0:9:15|Chen Kangyaner said to Li Baoting again.
0:9:23|0:9:24|Xiao Q is still trembling.
0:9:42|0:9:48|At night, the lights were turned off. [Li Baoer] came to Little Q's nest with her pillow and blanket.
0:9:48|0:10:1|He placed the pillow on the ground, covered the blanket, and fell asleep with [Xiao Q] in the dog's nest.
0:10:1|0:10:6|The scene shifts to the International Guide Dog Association, where [Simon] meets [Luliao Bishan] and [Chen Qi] again.
0:10:12|0:10:16|The door opens, and many Labrador Retrievers are led into the training hall.
0:10:16|0:10:22|[Li Qi] saw his former brothers and sisters, and rushed over, extremely happy, the dogs were wrestling together.
0:10:31|0:10:33|The trainers have dog food strapped around their waists.
0:10:33|0:10:42|[Simon] and [Bishan] demonstrate to everyone how to teach dogs to sit, stand up, stay still, and other actions.
0:10:42|0:10:47|[Mrs. Chen] is training [Li Baoting], who learns quickly and always gets some dog food as a reward.
0:10:50|0:11:6|Back at home, [Luliao Bishan] also prepared a pile of rewards for the dog.
0:11:6|0:11:15|Upon hearing the command, the little dogs obediently lay down on the ground.
0:11:15|0:11:18|At home, [Luliao Bishan] starts training [Chen Qi] in reverse.
0:11:19|0:11:24|Little Q, who should have been lying down, stood up instead upon hearing the command and walked towards [Simon].
0:11:24|0:11:29|Simon demonstrates teaching the dog to climb stairs.
0:11:29|0:11:32|Having watched the demonstration, [Chen Kangyaner] successfully led little Q up a flight of stairs.
0:11:35|0:11:48|At home, [Chen Zhiqiao] continues the reverse training for Little Q. On the stairs where one should pay attention to stepping down, [Chen Zhiqiao] keeps shouting to move forward.
0:11:48|0:11:58|In the training hall, the dogs are practicing navigating obstacles. When they encounter obstacles, they lead their owners around them. However, [Chen Zhiqiao] is training little Q to just jump over the obstacles directly.
0:12:2|0:12:7|At night, he only looked out the window and stuck three pencils into the sand.
0:12:28|0:12:31|The day of the first stage assessment for the guide dogs has finally arrived.
0:12:31|0:12:37|In the lobby, the American evaluator is leading a Labrador through obstacle courses and testing its focus.
0:12:59|0:13:1|Simon walked up to Chen Kangyaner and Chen Qi.
0:13:10|0:13:17|Li Qi was blindfolded with a guide saddle and began the test under the guidance of the examiner.
0:13:17|0:13:22|She smoothly navigated past the obstacles, with pigeons nearby and kites swaying in the air.
0:13:25|0:13:39|He continued to move forward with concentration, only glancing nervously at [Chen Kangyaner]. Even the delicious bones and dogs nearby, Little Q passed them without looking back.
0:13:43|0:13:50|Seeing how well Li Baoer did, some people are getting anxious. If Li Baoer passes, she will be taken away.
0:13:50|0:13:57|But [Chen Qi] successfully resisted all temptations and completed the test smoothly.
0:14:8|0:14:11|[Chen Zhiqiao] finds it hard to accept, tears welling up in her eyes.
0:14:11|0:14:15|Before long, [Simon] arrived at [Chen Zhiqiao]'s house to take Little Q away for training.
0:15:5|0:15:23|Xiao Q pushed the starlight lamp in front of [Chen Zhiqiao], gently patting his hand with his paw as if comforting [Chen Zhiqiao].
0:15:23|0:15:25|[Chen Zhiqiao] lights up the star lamp and hugs Little Qi tightly.
0:15:38|0:15:42|Chen Kangyaner is also a bit sad outside the door.
0:15:42|0:15:45|The door opened, and two people pushed it open and entered.
0:15:45|0:15:49|Simon squats in front of the paper bridge, embraced by Chen Kangyaner.
0:16:28|0:16:34|Li Qi tenderly licked Chen Zhiqiao's face, just like they did the first time they met.
0:16:36|0:16:42|Chen Kangyaner and Donggu bid farewell to Little Q as Simon carries him into the car.
0:16:48|0:16:49|[Chen Kangyaner] also held back her tears.
0:16:57|0:17:2|On the second-floor balcony, Zhiqiao looked sadly as the car carrying Chen Qi drove away.
0:17:2|0:17:5|He suddenly thought of something and ran downstairs.
0:17:5|0:17:16|The car turned a corner and drove out of the courtyard, with Zhiqiao holding a box chasing after the car.
0:17:27|0:17:32|He accidentally fell down, the box dropped to the ground, and the toys rolled onto the road.
0:17:32|0:17:36|He only took a step forward to chase, but was stopped by [Chen Kangyaner].
0:17:36|0:17:40|Watching Chen Zhiqiao getting farther and farther away, Li Baoting felt extremely heartbroken.
0:17:48|0:17:58|The scene changes, the guide dog association's car stops in front of Li Baoting's house, Simon and Luliao Bishan get out of the car, and Chen Zhiqiao is sitting inside the back door.
0:18:51|0:18:58|[Li Baoting] sat on the sofa in the distance, indifferent, without even turning his head.
0:19:5|0:19:7|[Li Baoer] walks towards [Li Baoting].
0:19:47|0:19:51|Everyone listened with some worry, but they were also powerless.
0:19:51|0:19:54|[Li Baoting] sat back on the sofa, and Chen Qi looked puzzled.
0:20:24|0:20:28|Simon is still very worried about Li Baoting and Chen Qi, with a look of concern on his face.
0:20:38|0:20:41|When everyone had left, [Simon] said.
0:21:22|0:21:28|[Li Baoer] looked at [Li Baoting], then at Chen Qi. He didn't know how [Li Baoting] would get along with Chen Qi.
0:21:36|0:21:41|Dusk, [Li Baoting] sits on the ground, drinking red wine alone.
0:21:41|0:21:45|Since losing his sight, he has been lonely and melancholic every day.
0:21:45|0:21:52|Li Qi stood up from the cushion on the side and walked around the room, getting familiar with this unfamiliar new environment.
0:21:52|0:21:55|This way, he can better help Li Baoting with his life.
0:22:2|0:22:11|He tilted his head to look at the photo of Li Baoting and Li Baoer on the cabinet, as well as the trophy Li Baoting won in the chef competition.
0:22:11|0:22:20|On the far left is a photo of Li Baoting when he was studying cooking with Master and his fellow apprentices.
0:22:20|0:22:27|Xiao Q looked at [Li Baoting] beside him, who remained motionless, filled with sadness and despair.
0:22:27|0:22:29|As the night fell, the sky gradually darkened.
0:22:38|0:22:45|He got up and fumbled to turn on all the lights in the room.
0:22:45|0:22:48|Afterwards, he turned on the television.
0:22:51|0:22:56|With the sound of the TV in the background, Li Baoting heats up his meal and fumbles his way to the dining table.
0:23:7|0:23:11|The TV is playing a video of a program that [Li Baoting] participated in before losing his sight.
0:23:11|0:23:15|In the show, [Li Baoting] tasted the dish in front of him.
0:23:57|0:24:10|Li Baoting walked behind [Chen Qi], startling him. Chen Qi walked away dejectedly and returned to his cushion to sit down. That was how Li Baoting and Chen Qi had no interaction.
0:24:22|0:24:24|The next day, the phone rang.
0:24:24|0:24:33|[Li Baoting] fumbled to answer the phone.
0:25:23|0:25:27|[Li Baoting] angrily hung up the phone and slammed the mobile phone on the table.
0:25:36|0:25:40|The corkscrew on the coffee table was knocked to the ground.
0:25:40|0:25:43|He bent down and searched around, but couldn't find the screwdriver.
0:25:46|0:25:52|He sat up helplessly.
0:25:52|0:26:4|Little Q sitting on a cushion in the distance saw it and quickly walked over to pick up the lighter, handing it to Li Baoting.
0:26:4|0:26:10|[Li Baoting] angrily flipped the table and drove away Chen Qi.
0:26:10|0:26:13|He slowly got up and sat back on the sofa, calling out to [Chen Qi].
0:26:21|0:26:30|As soon as Li Baoting approached Little Q, Li Baoting grabbed Little Q's collar, and Little Q struggled and cried out in pain.
0:26:30|0:26:35|[Li Baoting] staggered down the stairs, dragging Little Q along.
0:26:38|0:26:41|Chen Qi was eventually thrown onto the street.
0:26:41|0:26:52|[Li Baoting] slammed the door of the apartment building shut, and the bar owner next to him witnessed the scene.
0:26:52|0:27:2|Little Q obediently sat down at the entrance of the apartment building, waiting for his owner to pick him up and take him home.
0:27:2|0:27:4|At night, a heavy rain poured down.
0:27:10|0:27:28|[Li Baoting] is drinking alone in the bedroom, still not bringing Xiao Q home.
0:27:28|0:27:32|He was thinking about something and finally turned off the bedroom light.
0:27:47|0:27:56|Downstairs, Li Baoer hasn't gone anywhere.
0:27:56|0:28:1|He is hiding from the rain under a van at the entrance of the apartment building.
0:28:1|0:28:2|He is extremely helpless.
0:28:21|0:28:33|The bar owner turned off the lights and saw Little Q under the van.
0:28:33|0:28:40|Upstairs, the lights in Li Baoting's house flicker on and off. Chen Qi looks at the lights with anticipation, hoping that he can take her home.
0:28:42|0:28:47|The next day was sunny with good sunshine, and someone rang the doorbell at Li Baoting's house.
0:28:47|0:28:52|[Li Baoting] opened the door, [Chen Qi] ran in, followed by the [Bar Owner].
0:29:10|0:29:11|Li Baoting was filled with mixed emotions after hearing this.
0:29:11|0:29:12|He filled [Chen Qi]'s bowl with dog food.
0:29:36|0:29:46|[Li Baoting] stood up, turned around and left. [Chen Qi] stood up wanting to go after him, but only saw [Li Baoting] reaching the door, feeling for the guide cane, and walking out alone.
0:30:3|0:30:13|Li Qi returned to the cushion and faced a bowl of dog food, but he had no appetite and refused to eat a single bite.
0:30:13|0:30:18|The next day, [Li Baoer] arrived at [Li Baoting]'s home and started cleaning up the messy living room.
0:30:28|0:30:31|Q excitedly ran to the door, opened it, and it was Door C.
0:30:39|0:30:43|Simon saw the messy living room.
0:30:48|0:30:51|Simon noticed that the leash around Little Q's neck was not untied.
0:31:5|0:31:6|Arriving at his shop, they found his bowl stuffed with dog food.
0:31:55|0:31:59|The scene changes, [Li Baoting] is walking with Little Q on the sidewalk.
0:31:59|0:32:3|Behind them, [Simon] followed them cautiously.
0:32:8|0:32:11|[Li Baoting] appeared to be a bit nervous.
0:32:11|0:32:12|Approaching the edge of the steps.
0:32:16|0:32:18|[Li Baoting] tested the waters with his foot.
0:32:23|0:32:27|Little Q heard the command and continued forward.
0:32:27|0:32:32|Before long, Li Baoting saw a stalled motorcycle in front of him, and Xiao Q stopped again.
0:32:39|0:32:42|[Li Baoting] touches the edge of the motorcycle.
0:32:48|0:32:54|Forward, [Li Baoting] kicked the dog leash, and Xiao Q led him to the road, bypassing the motorcycles, and continued forward.
0:33:10|0:33:26|At the intersection, waiting for the traffic light to turn green, Xiao Q led Li Baoting across the zebra crossing and crossed the road.
0:33:26|0:33:30|At the entrance of the restaurant, [Li Baoer] ran towards them.
0:34:0|0:34:2|In the corner of the restaurant sits a mat.
0:34:4|0:34:7|Xiao Q ran over, always embroidering a cushion.
0:34:16|0:34:23|In the restaurant on the second floor, Li Baoting tasted the desserts made by his apprentices, while the others waited nervously for his evaluation.
0:34:23|0:34:24|He angrily slammed down the spoon.
0:35:14|0:35:18|On the other side, [Simon] took Little Q out to the restroom.
0:35:18|0:35:32|Li Baoer hasn't been to the bathroom for a long time.
0:35:32|0:35:35|[Li Baoting] gets off work, followed by [Simon] leading little Q.
0:35:36|0:35:37|Turning the corner, Li Baoting saw a car in front of him, and Xiao Q stopped.
0:36:45|0:36:49|At night at home, Li Baoting tasted the pudding he made himself and was very dissatisfied after taking two bites.
0:37:17|0:37:25|He angrily threw the pudding and the plate into the trash can.
0:37:25|0:37:33|Taking off his apron, [Li Baoting] walked to the table and accidentally knocked the guide cane on the table to the ground.
0:37:33|0:37:40|Xiao Q saw [Li Baoting] bend down to pick up the guide cane, thinking that [Li Baoting] wanted to go out, so he hurried over.
0:37:45|0:37:51|The scene shifts, [Li Baoting] takes Little Q to the park to use the restroom.
0:38:15|0:38:20|Later, [Li Baoting] and Chen Qi sat down on a bench under a big tree.
0:38:20|0:38:25|[Li Baoting] fumbled to sit down, with Chen Qi lying next to him.
0:38:45|0:39:6|[Li Baoting] made Xiao Q stand up, loosened the dog leash around his neck, and removed the guide saddle.
0:39:6|0:39:7|Chen Qi looked at him in confusion.
0:39:28|0:39:38|Li Qi quickly ran towards the distance.
0:39:38|0:39:42|[Li Baoting] took out his white cane from his pocket and felt his way home.
0:39:56|0:40:1|Xiao Q ran from a distance and followed behind [Li Baoting], silently protecting him.
0:40:8|0:40:28|[Li Baoting] noticed the little Q beside him, paused for a moment, looked down at him, and then they continued walking forward.
0:40:28|0:40:32|The scene changes, and there is a long line outside Li Baoting's restaurant.
0:40:43|0:40:48|In the kitchen upstairs, Li Baoting's apprentices are busy making desserts.
0:40:48|0:40:50|[Li Baoting] sat aside listening to all this.
0:41:16|0:41:22|[Li Baoting] came out with Little Q. While waiting for the green light at the intersection, [Li Baoting] recalled what [Li Baoer] had said to him.
0:41:42|0:41:46|The green light was on, but [Li Baoting] changed the route and turned right.
0:41:46|0:41:55|[Simon] quietly followed him not far behind.
0:41:57|0:42:6|The group was puzzled, not knowing where [Li Baoting] was going.
0:42:6|0:42:13|[Li Baoting] stopped by the roadside, with vehicles passing by in front of him. He recalled various experiences after falling ill.
0:42:52|0:43:1|Despair gradually accumulated in his heart, and blindness robbed his life of meaning.
0:43:1|0:43:8|He took a deep breath and slowly walked towards the center of the road.
0:43:8|0:43:12|Little Q called out in concern, and Simon also ran towards Li Baoting.
0:43:12|0:43:16|The car on the road swerved sharply to avoid hitting Li Baoting, causing chaos.
0:43:29|0:43:37|A white car slammed on the brakes in front of him, but the black car behind hit the rear of the white car, pushing it towards Mr. [Li Baoting].
0:43:37|0:43:44|Mr. Li Baoting stopped in his tracks and forced a bitter smile.
0:43:44|0:43:47|At a critical moment, Xiao Q ran towards Mr. [Li Baoting].
0:43:47|0:43:50|He quickly pushed Mr. [Li Baoting] away.
0:43:50|0:43:52|Mr. Li Baoting fell to the ground, narrowly escaping this disaster.
0:43:52|0:43:54|Simon also arrived in time.
0:44:25|0:44:35|Mr. Li Baoting's eyes were filled with tears, with Chen Qi lying next to him, his head resting against Mr. Li Baoting's hand, afraid that he would harm himself.
0:44:35|0:44:44|In the Guide Dog Association meeting hall, everyone is evaluating the pairing results of Mr. [Li Baoting] and Little Q. Mr. [Li Baoting] is waiting outside the room, accompanied by the trainer and Little Q.
0:45:43|0:45:46|Outside the conference hall, Mr. [Li Baoting] spoke to the instructor.
0:45:54|0:45:58|Little Q ran towards Mr. [Li Baoting], and Mr. [Li Baoting] affectionately stroked him.
0:46:14|0:46:18|[Li Baoting] gently kissed little Q.
0:46:18|0:46:22|The meeting ended, [Simon] called Little Q over.
0:46:34|0:46:37|[Li Baoting] is feeling lost.
0:46:43|0:46:48|He took out his white cane and walked towards the door alone.
0:46:48|0:47:4|Xiao Q saw [Li Baoting] and ran over, standing in front of him, not letting him leave.
0:47:4|0:47:8|The scene changes, [Li Baoting] leads Little Q out of the entrance of the cooperative association.
0:47:8|0:47:12|Their relationship touched the instructors, who eventually agreed to their pairing.
0:47:16|0:47:21|[Li Baoting] smiled happily.
0:47:21|0:47:27|He grabbed the guide cane and trustingly let [Chen Zhiqiao] lead him home.
0:47:33|0:47:41|As usual, when going down the stairs, Little Q would stop and guide Li Baoting step by step to safely descend the stairs.
0:47:41|0:47:56|Since then, [Li Baoting] has also become more cheerful, stopping to buy flowers on his way to work.
0:47:56|0:47:58|Will unconsciously smile while walking.
0:48:5|0:48:27|He would buy snacks for [Chen Qi], play games with [Chen Qi], and even allow [Chen Qi] to play with his desk lamp in his bedroom.
0:48:38|0:48:51|While tasting the apprentice's dessert, he also put away his sarcasm.
0:48:51|0:48:56|Because of Xiao Q, Li Baoting's life gradually became happy and joyful.
0:48:56|0:48:59|He also likes to take Chen Zhiqiao to the park.
0:48:59|0:49:3|Li Qi sat on a bench in the park listening to music while playing with the children.
0:49:13|0:49:20|Upon hearing Li Baoting's call, Chen Qi quickly ran to Li Baoting's side.
0:49:26|0:49:33|In the distance, a group of children playing baseball happily head home.
0:49:33|0:49:41|They rolled their baseball to Chen Qi's side, and Chen Qi happily picked it up and gave it to Li Baoting.
0:49:41|0:49:52|The children walked towards Mr. [Li Baoting] while looking for the ball.
0:49:52|0:49:58|Mr. Li Baoting secretly put the ball into his pocket, the children walked away, Mr. Li Baoting took out the baseball and handed it to Chen Qi.
0:50:21|0:50:25|A few days later, Mr. [Li Baoting] and his fellow apprentices went to visit Master's home in Guangzhou.
0:50:25|0:50:26|The car stopped at the service area.
0:50:56|0:51:6|Only Mr. [Li Baoting] and Chen Qi are left in the car.
0:51:6|0:51:10|Mr. Li Baoting also got out of the car to get some fresh air.
0:51:10|0:51:15|Two young people passed by and saw Little Q and Mr. Li Baoting, who was blind, and exchanged glances.
0:51:21|0:51:37|Brothers walked back, and a white unlicensed car stopped next to Mr. [Li Baoting]. A stick for catching dogs was extended from the car to pull Little Q into their car, and then quickly drove away. Mr. [Li Baoting] fell to the ground when he tried to chase after them.
0:51:45|0:51:59|A white van drives into a factory, filled with stolen dogs. The dog thief gets out of the car and little Q, locked in a cage, is taken off the vehicle.
0:52:53|0:52:55|Several fierce dog traffickers are smashing the car door.
0:53:23|0:53:26|[Li Baoting] opened the car door and rushed out, several people were fighting together.
0:53:32|0:53:35|[Li Baoting] was supported by his junior brother as they walked into the factory building where Guan Gou was.
0:53:38|0:53:40|Chen Qi also saw him, desperately clinging to the cage.
0:53:50|0:54:4|Suddenly, Li Baoting heard Little Q's shout and quickly walked towards the direction of the sound.
0:54:4|0:54:15|The dog dealers chased into the factory with sticks and steel pipes in their hands, causing chaos. The cages were overturned on the ground, and the dog dealers locked Li Baoting's neck. Junior brothers were fighting with others.
0:54:21|0:54:26|While Li Baoting was trying hard to listen to Xiao Q's voice, he was kicked down to the ground.
0:54:26|0:54:33|The dog dealer beat him fiercely, but he ignored the pain and crawled forward resolutely.
0:54:33|0:54:35|In front of Li Baoting is Little Q.
0:54:47|0:54:57|The police arrived in time and arrested all the dog traffickers.
0:54:57|0:54:59|The junior brother helped Li Baoting up.
0:55:2|0:55:8|The door of the cage was knocked open, and Xiao Q broke through the cage and ran towards Mr. [Li Baoting], who hugged Xiao Q tightly.
0:55:16|0:55:27|The scene shifts, and several people arrive at Master's house, where Mr. Li Baoting is wiping Chen Qi's body.
0:55:27|0:55:30|[Master] was supported into the courtyard and saw Mr. [Li Baoting].
0:56:11|0:56:28|Returning from Guangzhou, Mr. [Li Baoting], Xiao Q, [Li Baoer] and their disciples took a boat to an island for sightseeing. On the boat, Mr. [Li Baoting] kept playing with Xiao Q, and the scenery on the island was beautiful.
0:57:1|0:57:6|Mr. Li Baoting threw the baseball forward, and Chen Qi ran over, leaping up and catching the ball in mid-air.
0:57:6|0:57:9|[Li Baoer] watched, but felt a bit worried.
0:57:9|0:57:11|Mr. Li Baoting throws away the baseball that Little Q is holding in his mouth.
0:57:29|0:57:31|Mr. Li Baoting is going to race with everyone.
0:57:44|0:57:58|Under the leadership of Xiao Q, Mr. [Li Baoting] runs forward confidently, without having to worry about any danger. At this moment, he feels extremely happy.
0:58:12|0:58:28|Mr. Li Baoting couldn't run anymore, he lay on the grass, and Little Q ran over to play with him.
0:58:28|0:58:34|Next to the vending machine, Xiao Q ordered a bottle of Sprite for Li Baoting, who took a sip and found something wrong.
0:58:39|0:58:57|Li Qi suddenly stopped and looked into the distance, wanting to move forward.
0:58:57|0:59:3|It turns out that [Chen Zhiqiao] is in the distance. She has grown a lot taller, watching Little Q smile happily.
0:59:7|0:59:34|This joyful playfulness has become a norm, and the [Li Baoting] family often takes little Q to the island for fun. Little Q runs freely in the sunlight, playing for a while and then never forgets to run back to [Li Baoting] to check on him. [Li Baoting] enjoys watching his disciples play games with little Q, and he becomes more and more cheerful. He patiently teaches his disciples how to make desserts.
0:59:40|1:0:1|With the help of his apprentices, he also started to make exquisite and delicious desserts.
1:0:1|1:0:5|[Li Baoting] also wrote a book about himself and Xiao Q, called "Island, Ordinary".
1:0:12|1:0:23|This book is very popular, [Li Baoting] is invited to take flights to various bookstores for interviews, and his life becomes more enriched.
1:0:31|1:0:40|During the interview, little Q obediently lay at the feet of [Li Baoting].
1:0:40|1:0:47|As time passed, Li Baoting and Chen Qi became inseparable, growing closer and closer.
1:0:59|1:1:6|They went to the bustling city and to the tranquil riverside.
1:1:19|1:1:23|On the plane ride home, the flight attendant said to [Li Baoting].
1:1:35|1:1:38|[Li Baoting] takes out an apple from his pocket.
1:1:46|1:1:51|Little Q lay exhausted next to [Li Baoting], showing signs of aging.
1:1:51|1:2:5|The plane landed, and [Li Baoting] touched Little Q's bowl, only to find that Little Q hadn't eaten any of the apples.
1:2:5|1:2:14|Back home, [Chen Qi] often collapses on the cushion, listless.
1:2:19|1:2:25|Little Q is already eight years old, and his sister is ready to retire.
1:2:50|1:3:1|But in reality, [Chen Qi] was already very exhausted.
1:3:1|1:3:4|At night, Li Baoting camps with Little Q on the grass.
1:3:37|1:3:44|The sky is filled with twinkling stars, [Li Baoting] lovingly caresses little Q beside him.
1:3:44|1:3:50|Everything was as usual, [Li Baoting] and Chen Qi went downstairs and greeted the [Bar Owner].
1:3:58|1:4:1|[Li Baoting] took a few steps forward and suddenly felt uncomfortable.
1:4:3|1:4:15|He paused for a moment, then continued forward.
1:4:15|1:4:29|But after only a few steps, he slowed down, clutching his chest, and fell to the ground.
1:4:29|1:4:32|Q immediately sensed something was wrong and urgently pushed Li Baoting.
1:4:42|1:4:49|Seeing no response from him, clever [Chen Qi] suddenly turned and ran back.
1:4:51|1:5:3|Li Baoting was lying on the ground, as pointed out by Xiao Q looking to the left.
1:5:3|1:5:8|The scene shifts, with [Li Baoting] lying pale-faced on the hospital bed, while [Li Baoer] sits by his side.
1:5:12|1:5:18|Simon took Li Baoer away, asking her to get in the car, but she refused.
1:5:32|1:5:36|Simon squatted down, with Chen Zhiqiao crouching by his feet.
1:5:41|1:5:45|[Simon] looked towards the window of the hospital room of [Li Baoting] in the building.
1:5:45|1:5:56|In the hospital corridor, the doctor is explaining Mr. Li Baoting's condition to Li Baoer.
1:5:56|1:5:57|[Li Baoer] looks worried.
1:6:6|1:6:14|In the hospital room, Mr. [Li Baoting] woke up and heard Little Q calling outside the window. He hurriedly got up and moved slowly to the window.
1:6:32|1:6:40|Downstairs, Xiao Q saw Mr. [Li Baoting] through the window and howled, refusing to leave.
1:6:40|1:6:42|At night, Mr. Li Baoting holds Little Q in his arms.
1:7:49|1:7:55|The scene changes, the driver loads the luggage onto the car, it's time to say goodbye.
1:8:8|1:8:11|Little Q threw herself onto Mr. [Li Baoting], bidding a reluctant farewell.
1:8:14|1:8:17|Little Q looked at Mr. [Li Baoting] sadly, tears filling his eyes.
1:8:26|1:8:31|Mr. Li Baoting untied his dog leash and took out a baseball, which was little Q's favorite, from his pocket.
1:8:31|1:8:31|Mr. Li Baoting exerted all his strength to throw the baseball, and Little Q obediently ran off into the distance to fetch the ball.
1:8:50|1:8:56|[Li Baoting] listened to the sound of Little Q running, his expression filled with reluctance.
1:8:56|1:9:4|Little Q picked up the ball and saw that Li Baoting had already left by car.
1:9:4|1:9:11|He ran towards the direction the car was leaving at all costs, regardless of the obstacles.
1:9:11|1:9:15|He seemed to have exerted all his strength, closely following the van that was driving away.
1:9:19|1:9:32|[Li Baoting] remained silent, his expression filled with sadness and reluctance.
1:9:32|1:9:35|Qiao cleverly chose a shortcut and drove alongside Li Baoting's car.
1:9:42|1:9:48|Turning the corner, his car was so close to Li Baoting's car that another car suddenly rushed out from the side, almost colliding with him.
1:10:34|1:10:39|[Li Baoting] didn't mind, kept turning his head back, looking at little Q running behind the car with a heartache.
1:10:55|1:11:4|Li Qi was already exhausted, but he refused to stop chasing.
1:11:4|1:11:13|He followed the one running up the overpass.
1:11:13|1:11:15|He was about to catch up with the car almost immediately.
1:11:20|1:11:27|But found a huge protective net in front of him, unable to run past it no matter what.
1:11:34|1:11:39|[Li Baoer] turned her head, tears sliding down her cheeks.
1:11:39|1:11:42|She tried her best to control her emotions, not letting [Li Baoting] notice.
1:11:52|1:12:6|Little Q, blocked by the protective net, kept lowing and spinning, and finally sat on the ground exhausted, helpless and lost.
1:12:6|1:12:14|In the guide dog association, [Chen Zhiqiao] patiently waits, and when she sees Simon leading Little Q out, she happily stands up.
1:12:30|1:12:34|Xiao Q recognized Zhiqiao, just like Xiangyu, she gently licked Zhiqiao's face.
1:12:42|1:12:47|Li Qi returned to the original home again, excitedly familiarizing himself with the environment.
1:12:47|1:12:56|He ran from the garden into the house, saw Mrs. Chen, Mr. Chen, and [Chen Zhiqiao] who was making the bed for him.
1:13:12|1:13:18|Later, he ran to the cabinet under the TV and tried to open the cabinet door.
1:13:18|1:13:23|At this moment, [Chen Kangyaner] walked over.
1:13:28|1:13:32|[Chen Kangyaner] opens the cabinet door, revealing the starlight lamp inside.
1:13:41|1:13:44|Mrs. Chen called Little Q over.
1:14:19|1:14:22|At night, [Chen Zhiqiao] took out all of Little Q's toys.
1:15:13|1:15:20|Afterwards, Xiao Q and [Chen Zhiqiao] started living together again.
1:15:20|1:15:22|In the morning, she would jump on Chen Zhiqiao's bed to wake him up.
1:15:29|1:15:44|He lazily plays with the robotic vacuum cleaner, accidentally dropping a piece of dog food on the floor. Before little Q can eat it, the vacuum cleaner sucks up the dog food, leaving little Q puzzled.
1:15:44|1:15:46|They will go to the park where they used to play together.
1:15:59|1:16:1|Xiao Q will swing on the swing with [Chen Zhiqiao].
1:16:28|1:16:33|Zhiqiao and Chen Qi took a taxi home, passing by the park where Li Baoting often stays.
1:16:38|1:16:46|Little Q looked excitedly out the window. The bench was empty now, and he probably remembered the time playing with [Li Baoting].
1:16:46|1:16:51|One day, when Little Q went missing, the security guard spoke to [Chen Zhiqiao] and [Simon].
1:17:2|1:17:4|Xiao Q ran towards [Chen Zhiqiao].
1:17:11|1:17:16|Before long, [Chen Qi] returned to squat by the bed again.
1:17:16|1:17:26|In the past, Li Baoer waited for Little Qi to come back after playing.
1:17:50|1:17:55|After that, Zhiqiao often took little Q to the factory to bask in the sun.
1:17:55|1:17:57|Li Qi was quietly lying down, while Zhiqiao was reading a book.
1:18:5|1:18:19|And so, as time slowly transitions from summer to autumn, the leaves of the trees by the bench fall one by one, the weather turning colder day by day, until the whole world becomes bare.
1:18:19|1:18:26|Time passed slowly, and Xiao Q's body gradually weakened, but Li Baoting still did not return.
1:18:38|1:18:41|One morning, [Chen Zhiqiao] came down from upstairs.
1:18:56|1:18:59|She found that there was no less dog food in Little Q's bowl. Is she going to be busy?
1:19:0|1:19:0|Just put a leash on Little Q and take him to the bathroom.
1:19:0|1:19:1|Ke Xiaoqiu refused to stand up.
1:19:1|1:19:2|No matter how she hugged him, he remained unmoved.
1:19:2|1:19:2|Something just doesn't seem right when you look at this.
1:19:28|1:19:32|The scene shifts, and the veterinarian [Ryan] is examining him.
1:19:40|1:19:44|Because it walks more than the average dog, its wear and tear will be more severe.
1:20:10|1:20:16|Li Qi put on protective gear, with two wheels supporting his belly to reduce the strain on his legs.
1:20:16|1:20:28|[Chen Zhiqiao] is telling a story to Little Q on the bench.
1:20:28|1:20:32|In the evening, [Li Baoting] returned home after school.
1:21:8|1:21:24|Xiao Q looked at the precious photos on the cabinet, there were group photos with the instructor, with the [Li Baoting] family, photos of Donggu, and Xiao Q's handprint.
1:21:24|1:21:28|He slowly drifted off to sleep.
1:21:28|1:21:35|As the days went by, Li Baoer's health deteriorated gradually, and he went for another check-up.
1:21:49|1:21:50|The situation with [Chen Qi] is indeed not very optimistic.
1:22:17|1:22:25|He said slowly, feeling extremely heartbroken.
1:22:41|1:22:44|Xiao Q is still waiting for Li Baoting to come back.
1:22:44|1:22:53|The day has finally arrived, and Chen Qi seems to sense Li Baoting's arrival, staring fixedly at the door.
1:22:53|1:23:0|He struggled to stand up, his left hind leg unable to touch the ground.
1:23:0|1:23:2|He walked unsteadily towards the door.
1:23:15|1:23:24|[Li Baoting] tenderly caressed Little Q.
1:23:34|1:23:45|Li Baoting licked Li Baoting's face, tears in his eyes, reunited after a long separation, he hugged Little Q tightly.
1:23:45|1:23:47|Li Baoting brought Little Q back home.
1:24:28|1:24:46|[Li Baoting] and Chen Qi reunited, living together again. The empty house didn't feel lonely.
1:24:46|1:24:51|Xiao Q pushed the guide saddle next to [Li Baoting], trying to guide him once again.
1:25:4|1:25:28|[Li Baoting] caressed Little Q, and then left with Little Q. On the nighttime sidewalk, Little Q walked slowly but still meticulously guided [Li Baoting] along the way.
1:25:34|1:25:40|Approaching the intersection, they stood quietly waiting for the traffic lights.
1:25:40|1:25:46|The city was empty and quiet at night.
1:25:46|1:25:56|Li Baoer's body is very weak, and she must sit down to rest even when waiting for the traffic lights.
1:25:56|1:25:58|On the quiet road, only faint vehicles could be heard.
1:26:3|1:26:24|The green light came on, [Li Baoting] struggled to get up. Instead, he heard the words "move forward" that [Li Baoting] had said countless times. They slowly passed through the intersection, memories from the past flooding into [Li Baoting]'s mind bit by bit. Reluctance, heartache, touched, all turned into tears sliding down his cheeks.
1:27:7|1:27:21|[Chen Qi] wearily lay down, resting his head on [Li Baoting]'s lap, while [Li Baoting] sat on the ground stroking [Chen Qi].
1:27:27|1:27:40|In the pet hospital, Li Baoting is trying to save Little Q, performing CPR on him. Outside the emergency room, Li Baoting and others are anxiously waiting for the outcome.
1:27:40|1:27:46|Seeing a guide dog leading a blind person passing by, [Chen Kangyaner] said.
1:28:47|1:28:49|[Chen Qi] has been successfully rescued.
1:28:49|1:28:52|He lay exhausted with a respirator.
1:28:52|1:28:54|Everyone gathered around him.
1:28:54|1:29:1|[Li Qi] also watched them quietly.
1:29:1|1:29:7|Finally, Li Baoting decided to take Li Baoer to the island again for some fun.
1:29:7|1:29:11|At this point, Li Baoer could no longer walk.
1:29:16|1:29:23|Mr. Li, supported by [Li Baoer], carries Little Q forward, with the paper bridge beside them.
1:29:23|1:29:35|Li Baoer looked at the familiar small island and the familiar river.
1:29:35|1:29:38|Walking to the riverbank, Mr. Li settled Little Q into a chair.
1:29:56|1:29:59|Li Baoting stood up and sighed.
1:30:16|1:30:22|Mr. Li took the phone from [Li Baoer]'s hand, and a few people gathered around Little Q to strike a pose.
1:30:55|1:31:3|A group of people are playing with their dogs on the lawn in the distance.
1:31:3|1:31:11|Li Baoting looked at the people playing in the distance with his eyes wide open, feeling the emotions of Little Q as he touched him.
1:31:23|1:31:33|Chen Qi is helped to the grass.
1:31:46|1:31:59|Li Qi dragged his heavy steps slowly towards the crowd playing in the distance.
1:31:59|1:32:4|Halfway there, he turned around and looked at Mr. Li.
1:32:10|1:32:12|He turned his head and walked towards the crowd.
1:32:14|1:32:18|People in the distance noticed Little Q and lovingly caressed her.
1:32:39|1:32:41|[Li Baoting] is lost in imagination and memories.
1:32:46|1:32:52|He imagined Little Q running, jumping, and having a great time.
1:32:52|1:32:55|In the sunshine, [Chen Qi] is full of vitality.
1:33:0|1:33:13|He recalled the time spent with Chen Zhiqiao at the Guide Dog Association, watching the paper sheath welcome and train new guide dogs.
1:33:15|1:33:23|He sunbathed on the bench with [Chen Qi], only scratching [Chen Qi] to make her laugh. They played baseball together in the snow.
1:33:36|1:33:47|It's Xiao Q's birthday, and people have prepared a baseball-shaped cake for him.
1:33:47|1:33:52|And then, [Li Baoer] blindfolded, ran under the guidance of Little Q.
1:33:52|1:33:54|[Li Baoting] took Little Q to the pet hospital for a check-up.
1:34:16|1:34:23|And that time, instead of secretly hiding the baseball bat, he gave the children money to buy the baseball bat.
1:34:32|1:34:45|On the night of their first encounter, Xiao Q was driven under the car by [Li Baoting], and it was the [Bar Owner] who fed Xiao Q. [Li Baoting] himself also did not sleep all night.
1:34:45|1:34:51|Before meeting Li Baoting, Xiao Q was patiently trained and bathed by Chen Zhiqiao at the guide dog association.
1:34:56|1:35:5|Moving back in time, it turns out that [Chen Zhiqiao] and [Li Baoting] used to secretly play baseball with little Q after [Chen Kangyaner] left.
1:35:5|1:35:16|Sometimes, [Chen Kangyaner] blow-dries [Li Baoting]'s hair, and [Li Baoting] helps blow-dry [Chen Zhiqiao]'s hair. When [Chen Zhiqiao] takes care of the hair for Donggu and Little Q together, the family is harmonious and happy.
1:35:16|1:35:19|[Chen Zhiqiao] and Little Q playing in the park scene is still vivid in my mind.
1:35:28|1:35:51|In the end, [Li Baoting] also remembered how little Qi looked when he was a child, like a little ball of fur. Back then, he was with his siblings, who would all grow up to be excellent guide dogs. Little Qi still had a red collar around his neck, crawling with a birthmark on his belly, like a seagull spreading its wings.
1:35:54|1:35:58|After Xiao Q passed away, Li Baoting was seen only tending to the flowers in the courtyard.
1:35:58|1:36:4|Suddenly, he found the baseball in the soil.
1:36:5|1:36:10|Little Q, holding a baseball bat, buried it.
1:36:10|1:36:11|Li Baoting smiled with relief.
1:36:18|1:36:30|[Li Baoting] did not want a second guide dog. He came to the familiar little island for camping alone, holding the baseball that Little Q liked tightly in his hand.
1:36:30|1:36:44|Then he forcefully threw the baseball out, and it rolled to a stone with the words "Chen Qi, your footprints will always remain in my heart" engraved on it, next to the nostalgic guide saddle.
