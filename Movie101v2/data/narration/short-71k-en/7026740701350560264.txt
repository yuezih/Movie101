0:1:40|0:1:46|[Lin Xiangyu] and [Li Dapeng] stood in a horse stance, revealing their secret weapon in the middle - an alpaca.
0:2:6|0:2:11|[Lin Xiangyu] taps the beat on the stage with his leather shoes, and the performance begins.
0:2:52|0:3:4|[Lin Xiangyu] and [Li Dapeng] helplessly took off their hats, rolled on the ground with their heads, and the audience below clapped excitedly. Faced with such a farce, the judges couldn't help but scratch their heads.
0:3:5|0:3:19|In the campus, [Li Dapeng] drove a brand new pickup truck, and a group of hooligans led by [Huangmao] approached.
0:3:26|0:3:44|Huangmao stared at Yangduo with ill intentions, squatting down to look under the alpaca's crotch. As he stood up, Huangmao was sprayed in the face by the carrot bits from the alpaca's mouth. After wiping off the stains on his face, Huangmao heavily slapped the alpaca's neck, prompting Li Dapeng to quickly chase after the startled alpaca.
0:4:7|0:4:38|[Guan Chao] was dragged away by [Lin Xiangyu], while [Huangmao] was also lifted up by three brothers. I'm waiting for you. [Lin Xiangyu] and [Guan Chao] returned to the male dormitory building. The corridor was full of clothes. The two of them, dressed in performance costumes, swaggered to the door of Room 330. There was an advertisement board hanging on the wooden door, listing pickled chicken feet, pig skin, and Ma Er cigarettes. They opened the door and walked in. [Xie Xun] was counting money and greeted them.
0:5:45|0:5:51|[Xie Xun] snatched the 50 yuan from [Monkey]'s hand and asked him, to which [Monkey] shyly smiled and replied.
0:5:58|0:6:4|[Xie Xun] took out a copy of "The Golden Lotus," opened it to reveal a large hole inside filled with numerous condoms.
0:7:17|0:7:26|Monkey ran to the wall in a hurry to pee, just as he was about to pull down his pants, Xie Xun shouted.
0:7:32|0:7:40|Monkey could only pick up the bottle and avoid the crowd after hearing this, heading to the corner to pour it out. However, Lin Xiangyu ran over and snatched the bottle away.
0:8:3|0:8:26|A dozen bottles were placed by the window, and [Li Dapeng] excitedly asked everyone. The group responded loudly that the city below would be the starting point for these boys to explore the world. [Lin Xiangyu]'s internship location, Ping'an Building, was also below their feet.
0:8:54|0:9:2|Manager Wang, who is not one to smile, led the young and fresh-faced Lin Xiangyu into the tidy and orderly office area, swiping the card to enter.
0:9:13|0:9:18|[Lin Xiangyu] curiously looked around the work environment.
0:9:18|0:9:28|In the cubicle, people were busy with their heads down, no one noticed Lin Xiangyu. In the corner by the bookshelf, wearing a professional suit with long black hair, stood on a high stool.
0:9:28|0:9:31|The back of the woman organizing the folders caught the eye of [Lin Xiangyu].
0:9:31|0:9:57|When the beauty finished selecting the files and got off the stool, [Lin Xiangyu] finally saw her face clearly. Under the black hair, her face was as gentle as jade. She walked towards [Lin Xiangyu] with soft hair and light steps. In just a few short steps, it seemed like she had walked into [Lin Xiangyu]'s heart. [Lin Xiangyu]'s inexperienced pupils couldn't contain the excitement, unable to move his gaze away. His palms were sweating, heart racing. This is probably what love at first sight feels like.
0:9:57|0:10:6|It seems that [Lin Xiangyu] noticed the hot gaze, the beauty looked over here, facing such a direct gaze, his face showed a hint of displeasure.
0:10:6|0:10:11|Just then, Manager Wang finished his call and walked into the office, saying to Lin Xiangyu,
0:10:13|0:10:17|Let's go, [Manager Wang] took him straight to the beautiful woman he had just seen.
0:10:58|0:11:8|[Xu Meixin] handled official business, finished giving instructions, and briskly walked towards the cubicle opposite. [Lin Xiangyu] stood there until [Xu Meixin] sat down, then finally withdrew his lingering gaze, revealing a confident smile aimed at the beauty.
0:11:10|0:11:19|[Xie Xun] continued to be busy for the banknotes over there. He stood at the entrance of the train station, eating buns, waiting for the arrival of the out-of-province civil engineering team, snow falling.
0:11:32|0:11:44|Deng Ge sat in the newly purchased second-hand car, [Xie Xun] happily caressed the decorations inside the car, played with various buttons and components, started the engine with a slap on the steering wheel, and drove confidently towards the street.
0:11:45|0:11:51|[Xie Xun], this money-making expert always knows where the money is and seizes the opportunity. He has started scalping tickets at the theater again.
0:11:51|0:11:58|Xie Xun quickly stepped forward and grabbed the girl's arm as a couple walked past him.
0:12:4|0:12:15|The couple walked into the theater bickering, leaving [Xie Xun] standing alone forlornly under the steps. He mistook the girl for his first love, Xiaojing, who he thought was after wealthy men.
0:12:15|0:12:23|Walking alone in the square, [Xie Xun] took out his phone, scrolled through the contacts, hesitated for a while, and finally pressed the call button.
0:13:13|0:13:23|The scene cuts to [Guan Chao]'s office where he is flipping through a newspaper without looking up. [Guan Chao] picks up the lunchbox on the desk, preparing to leave.
0:13:37|0:13:50|[Guan Chao] walked up the stairs to the TOEFL class, suddenly remembered something, opened his lunch box, spat a few mouthfuls into it, closed it as if nothing had happened, shook it well, and went upstairs with a smile to deliver it to the editor's son.
0:13:50|0:13:58|The editor's son at the classroom door during breakfast complained that [Guan Chao] didn't want to stay longer.
0:14:1|0:14:24|The chubby boy angrily took the lunch box and twisted back to the classroom. [Guan Chao] swung a punch into the air behind the chubby boy, then turned around muttering to himself, ready to go downstairs. He lowered his head and swung his hand towards the air again, but unexpectedly a girl [Du Xiaoxiao] walked towards him, right into the path of the slap. He quickly spoke up.
0:14:30|0:14:46|Halfway through the apology, this inexperienced young man couldn't take his eyes off Du Xiaoxiao's chest. Du Xiaoxiao responded with a big slap, causing Guan Chao's glasses to jump and fall back on his nose, but his heart could no longer settle back in place.
0:14:47|0:14:52|Watching the pure and innocent girl [Guan Chao] in front of him, Lin Xiangyu's heart beats faster and faster.
0:14:52|0:14:56|The innocent virgin Lin Xiangyu from 330 had his eyes opened by a girl's slap.
0:14:57|0:15:2|The scene shifts to a garden where [Li Dapeng] is gently speaking to a lamb outside the fence.
0:15:4|0:15:18|During the mating season, Luo Jie suddenly rushed towards [Li Dapeng]'s buttocks. [Li Dapeng] shouted, "Roger, no, Roger, don't!" Now, [Li Dapeng] had to quickly arrange blind dates for Roger.
0:15:20|0:15:25|[Li Dapeng] tidied his hair in front of his phone and put a beautiful bow tie on the alpaca.
0:16:55|0:17:2|Watching [Xu Meixin]'s frosty expression, [Lin Xiangyu] reached into his backpack and pulled out a disc.
0:17:13|0:17:28|The blatant love song made [Xu Meixin] feel a bit embarrassed. She turned off the car stereo, but [Lin Xiangyu] continued playing it on his phone. He then opened the phone camera and started recording a video.
0:18:16|0:18:34|[Xu Meixin] gave a cold smile and shouted to get out, [Lin Xiangyu] was forced off the car, watching [Xu Meixin] ride away, completely dumbfounded. After finishing the business and bidding farewell to the client, [Xu Meixin] walked to the car, about to open the door when she heard...
0:18:47|0:19:5|[Xu Meixin] shook her head, walked to the back of the car, opened the trunk, took out a bottle of mineral water and threw it over. The water bottle drew an arc in the air, but was caught steadily by [Lin Xiangyu]. He opened the cap and poured the water over his head, enjoying the coolness freely.
0:19:5|0:19:29|Looking at the big boy [Xu Meixin] in front of her, [Lin Xiangyu] suddenly felt a flutter in her heart. With his hair swaying, sparkling water droplets splashed around, exuding youth and vitality all over. The boy drinking water under the sun, tilting his head back, captivated [Xu Meixin], who was lost in thought. After finishing his drink with gusto, [Lin Xiangyu] noticed a different look in [Xu Meixin]'s eyes, confidently laughing back with a gaze full of emotion.
0:20:53|0:21:4|[Xu Meixin] glared at [Lin Xiangyu] indignantly, then abruptly hit the brakes, causing [Lin Xiangyu] to be thrown onto the busy street once again. The scene then shifted to a restaurant by the river.
0:21:29|0:21:58|Looking at the river while biting his finger, feeling the cool breeze, he must have found the answer in his heart. The summer campus breeze rustled the leaves, and [Monkey] was sitting at the cafeteria table, legs crossed, eating heartily. Not far away, [Huangmao] saw [Monkey] and smirked disdainfully. At that moment, the well-built student union president Han Shu walked into the cafeteria. Thinking that no one was watching, [Monkey] reached out and pulled Han Shu, who passed by. Han Shu was surprised and shyly smiled, then walked away quietly.
0:21:58|0:22:5|This scene was seen by [Huangmao], who then turned his eyes and said to the person next to him.
0:22:15|0:22:34|Huangmao raised his chin and looked at Monkey. At this moment, Han Shu came back with a tray and sat behind Huangmao. Huangmao turned his head and glanced back, his mind starting to wander.
0:22:42|0:22:48|Hearing this, Han Shu, who lacks confidence in his figure, nervously touched himself.
0:23:6|0:23:47|Han Shu bit his lip, lowered his head, dropped the chopsticks, got up and left. [Monkey] rushed over and shouted, [Huangmao] grabbed [Monkey] and pinned him down. In the next second, [Huangmao] pressed him down. Turning around, it was the boys from dorm 330. [Xie Xun] grabbed [Huangmao] by the neck and forcefully pressed him on the table. [Huangmao] stubbornly refused to back down, [Guan Chao] couldn't stand it, and grabbed him forcefully between his legs.
0:23:52|0:24:1|[Xie Xun] and [Guan Chao] finally let go. [Huangmao] and his little brothers stood up angrily, left under the intimidating gaze of the male students in 330 dormitory, and returned to the dormitory together.
0:24:8|0:24:14|[Lin Xiangyu] sat on the bed with a notebook, [Li Dapeng] teased him.
0:24:23|0:24:47|[Lin Xiangyu] jokingly plays around with his brothers, leaving only [Lin Xiangyu] in the dormitory, showing a hint of a smile of being in love. The pace of the workplace in Shanghai is completely different from that of the campus. Early in the morning, [Lin Xiangyu] arrives at the office area. When [Xu Meixin] enters the work area, she sees [Lin Xiangyu] actively organizing his workstation. Knowing his intentions, there is inevitably some ambiguity when they meet again.
0:24:49|0:24:56|[Xu Meixin] deliberately walked slowly, looked at [Lin Xiangyu] for a while before returning to her workstation. When [Lin Xiangyu] saw [Xu Meixin] coming, he straightened up.
0:25:9|0:25:17|[Xu Meixin] didn't expect the cynical [Lin Xiangyu] to be quite serious about work. She took the documents and, after looking through them, praised them.
0:25:22|0:25:46|[Lin Xiangyu] returned to his seat and immersed himself in work, while [Xu Meixin] was distracted, occasionally lifting her head to sneak a peek at the handsome and serious look of [Lin Xiangyu] working. Some feelings had already taken root in [Xu Meixin]'s heart. Even during the meeting, [Xu Meixin] couldn't control herself and looked towards [Lin Xiangyu] as he returned to their face-to-face workstations. [Lin Xiangyu] searched for a stack of documents, stood up, and handed them over.
0:25:46|0:25:54|While flipping through the documents, a photo fell onto the table, and [Xu Meixin] stared at the photo in a daze.
0:26:4|0:26:9|The adorable boy in the photo, his gentle mother,
0:26:9|0:26:16|Not far behind, there is a girl taking photos. The camera then shifts to the English TOEFL class at New Oriental.
0:26:16|0:26:24|[The teacher] wrote a short English sentence on the blackboard, "Love at first sight," then turned around and asked the students,
0:26:35|0:27:6|Sitting under the platform, the students began to flip through their books. Only by the window, [Du Xiaoxiao] absentmindedly rested her head on her hand, lost in thought. When [Du Xiaoxiao] snapped out of it and looked at the short sentence on the blackboard to answer, she glanced out the window. [Guan Chao] was sitting by the lawn under the window, also lost in thought while looking at [Du Xiaoxiao]. In the evening, [Guan Chao] finally waited for [Du Xiaoxiao] to finish class.
0:27:6|0:27:35|Two people walked side by side on the streets of Shanghai after the rain. Lin Xiangyu, a male otaku, and Xu Meixin, a female otaku who had never experienced love before, shyly confirmed the budding love in their hearts on this rainy night. The two stood in front of the zebra crossing waiting for the traffic lights. Guan Chao secretly glanced at Du Xiaoxiao, who nervously adjusted her glasses. Both of them blushed, their hearts racing, but neither said a word, staring intently at the flashing signal lights across the street.
0:27:35|0:27:44|After being allowed to pass, Du Xiaoxiao was about to leave when she was suddenly pulled back by Guan Chao, and before she could even react, she found herself being embraced.
0:27:44|0:27:52|At this moment, time seemed to stand still for a pair of young boys and girls in the first flush of love, quietly enjoying each other's warm embrace.
0:27:52|0:28:17|In front of the small hotel reception desk, facing the scrutinizing gaze of the clerk, the newly minted young couple embraced each other. Their eyes carried a kind of almost savage determination. In the dimly lit room, filled with an ambiguous atmosphere, [Guan Chao] grabbed [Du Xiaoxiao]'s arm to kiss her, only to realize that both of their bags were still hanging on them. He quickly and nervously took off the bags, and the two sat closer and closer to each other on the edge of the bed, breathing in each other's pure scent.
0:28:17|0:28:25|Taking off Guan Chao's glasses, Du Xiaoxiao hesitated and spoke up.
0:28:26|0:28:32|[Guan Chao] finally wrapped his arms around [Du Xiaoxiao]'s neck, kissed deeply, and then passionately embraced, opening up their first love for each other.
0:28:33|0:28:38|Accompanied by a loud neigh, the scene shifts to the horse ranch.
0:29:2|0:29:15|[Xu Meixin] looked at the tall and majestic figure in front of her with some hesitation. As [Xu Meixin] sat down, [Boss Dong] unexpectedly also swung his leg over the saddle.
0:29:28|0:29:34|Walking, feeling the greasy body of [Boss Dong] behind her, [Xu Meixin] felt extremely uncomfortable, while [Lin Xiangyu] hurriedly shouted and followed along.
0:30:14|0:30:20|[Lin Xiangyu] coughed a few times, pretending to be awake.
0:30:49|0:31:7|The two returned to the hotel room, [Lin Xiangyu] was checking himself in the mirror. The 10-centimeter abrasion on his back from the stone earlier was shocking. He endured the pain, put on his clothes, thinking about driving back to Shanghai with [Xu Meixin] at night. He picked up the men's cologne on the sink and sprayed it all over himself.
0:31:7|0:31:16|At night, [Lin Xiangyu] drove on the dark road.
0:31:33|0:31:35|Xu Meixin felt a bit awkward and tried to ease the situation by speaking up,
0:32:6|0:32:14|Outside the car, there are dark clouds, inside the car, there is soft music playing, and beside is the master who makes one's heart flutter, an ambiguous atmosphere slowly growing inside the car.
0:32:17|0:32:47|In the midst of a sudden thunderstorm, the tire burst. Xu Meixin illuminated Lin Xiangyu with a flashlight. Lin Xiangyu, holding a wrench, struggled to remove the tire in the pouring rain. The wrench slipped, forcing Lin Xiangyu to squat and exert more force with his back to Xu Meixin. The blood seeping from the wound caught Xu Meixin's eye.
0:32:58|0:33:11|In the pouring rain, [Xu Meixin] looked up at the earnest boy in front of her. He was wrestling with a wrench in the rain, his soaked shirt revealing his toned muscles underneath.
0:33:11|0:33:26|In Xu Meixin's eyes, Lin Xiangyu is gradually transforming from a student into a man. Perhaps even she hasn't realized that this occasionally frivolous but wholehearted disciple is slowly entering her heart.
0:33:32|0:33:51|[Xu Meixin] raised the flashlight and shone it into the distance, vaguely seeing several cars parked by the roadside. [Lin Xiangyu] extended his arms to steady [Xu Meixin]'s head, and the two of them jogged over to a small car.
0:33:55|0:34:18|[Xu Meixin] shone a flashlight towards the car, and the rear window rolled down, revealing a naked man's head. It wasn't until several cars passed by that they realized they were disturbing someone's private moment.
0:34:28|0:34:29|The two of them awkwardly ran back to the car.
0:34:39|0:34:47|The car broke down on the side of the road, the rain had stopped, and there was an endless field next to it, very quiet.
0:34:47|0:34:56|It seems like the whole world has only the two of them left. In the dimly lit car, the two sat in silence, each with their own thoughts.
0:35:1|0:35:13|After finishing speaking, Xu Meixin opened the glove compartment, took out some cotton and band-aids, and looked at Lin Xiangyu, who was shirtless. Her heart tightened, and she nervously said, "Turn around."
0:35:15|0:35:47|[Lin Xiangyu] turned around with his back to [Xu Meixin]. [Xu Meixin] slowly approached and used a cotton ball to wipe the wound on his back. [Lin Xiangyu] endured the pain as he felt [Xu Meixin]'s fingers gently treating the wound. With her delicate fingers, [Xu Meixin] lightly pressed the ends of the band-aid on [Lin Xiangyu]'s skin. After finishing the wound treatment, [Xu Meixin] didn't move, she quietly watched [Lin Xiangyu]'s back.
0:35:48|0:36:14|[Lin Xiangyu] turned around, and [Xu Meixin]'s hand quickly moved away as if shocked. She sat there, nervously swaying her body and eyes. Sensing the unnatural atmosphere in the car, [Lin Xiangyu] awkwardly and slowly put on his shirt while stealing glances at [Xu Meixin]. The two young people sat upright, all wet, in the car. [Xu Meixin] dared not look at [Lin Xiangyu], clearly not ready yet.
0:36:14|0:36:46|[Lin Xiangyu] mustered up the courage to make a move, but then heard [Lin Xiangyu] leaning in, placing a hand on [Xu Meixin]'s shoulder, helping her fix her hair on the car door. The two seemed to be kissing, with [Lin Xiangyu]'s arm around [Xu Meixin]'s upper body. Their breathing became more and more rapid, and their lips slowly moved closer together.
0:36:47|0:36:53|[Xu Meixin] doesn't seem to have any intention of avoiding it either, as the two of them get closer and closer, the throbbing heartbeat in their chests.
0:36:53|0:37:26|[Lin Xiangyu] wrapped his arms around [Xu Meixin]'s neck, closed his eyes, and leaned in towards her lips that he had longed for. Just as he was about to continue, a sudden knock on the door startled the two. Outside the car window, two mechanics in uniforms suppressed their laughter as they looked at this young couple. The morning sun sprinkled on the Huangpu River, where the two parked their car by the river, opened the door, and enjoyed the small happiness between lovers, feeling the breeze from the river.
0:37:26|0:37:35|The once cold and tough steel forest, Shanghai, at this moment, also becomes gentle, with birds nestling in the arms of [Lin Xiangyu].
0:37:40|0:38:7|[Xu Meixin] opened her phone and carefully looked at a childhood photo of herself. [Lin Xiangyu] enlarged the photo on the phone, and the young [Xu Meixin] looked particularly delicate. Behind the young [Xu Meixin] were two familiar figures. [Lin Xiangyu] was stunned, took out his own phone, opened the album, and found the photo of himself as a child with his mother. He carefully enlarged it and compared the two photos.
0:38:7|0:38:14|The girl with a faint smile behind her is none other than the childhood [Xu Meixin].
0:38:18|0:38:26|[Lin Xiangyu] couldn't believe such a coincidence,
0:38:44|0:39:17|Watching the girl [Lin Xiangyu] in front of him with whom he has a deep connection, [Li Dapeng] couldn't help but pull her into his arms [Xu Meixin] and nodded with a smile. [Li Dapeng] leaned down to kiss [Xu Meixin], playfully dodging her lips. [Xu Meixin] also responded affectionately, nodding solemnly as lovers. The two embraced sweetly as if no one else was around, deeply kissing by the rushing waters of the Huangpu River behind them. The passing cruise boats on the river and the tall buildings on the opposite bank also witnessed the deep affection of this couple.
0:39:20|0:39:41|In a milk tea shop, the male students from dorm 330 are having a gathering. When the late arrival Lin Xiangyu enters, everyone looks surprised. Lin Xiangyu smiles smugly, but Xie Xun pushes him aside with a big hand. Xu Meixin, who is hiding behind, looks at everyone with a smile. Lin Xiangyu's smug smile attracts some teasing and roughhousing from his good buddies.
0:39:41|0:39:48|After the party, the scene shifts to a small balcony.
0:40:45|0:40:52|Du Xiaoxiao felt a bit heartbroken after hearing that, and took off the jade pendant from her neck.
0:41:26|0:41:40|Du Xiaoxiao stood up proudly and loudly said, turning to Guan Chao, "Du Xiaoxiao continued,"
0:41:42|0:41:50|[Guan Chao] sat on the side with a frown on his face.
0:42:2|0:42:20|Du Xiaoxiao didn't expect this answer. He put away his previous pride, lowered his head as if he had done something wrong, fingers rubbing his clothes. The once gentle and sweet old town of Shanghai now seemed weary. Outside the court, Xie Xun was as usual doing small business.
0:42:24|0:42:32|Turning his head, [Xie Xun] saw Xiaojing walking down the steps with her big belly. He rushed over excitedly, grabbed her arm, and said
0:42:41|0:42:48|Xiong Ge cried with his shoulders shrugged like a child who had his candy stolen.
0:43:5|0:43:15|[Xie Xun] shook off Xiaojing's hand and roared loudly, "Xiaojing, you're hopeless." She looked at the man in front of her who used to hold her in the palm of his hand.
0:44:25|0:44:30|[Monkey] couldn't bear the arrogance of [Huangmao] and straightened his back to start the fight.
0:45:25|0:45:41|Driven by a strong sense of collective honor and disgrace, the students descended the stairs in the style of gangsters to confront [Huangmao]. [Xie Xun] and [Guan Chao] walked proudly at the front, but as they reached the bottom of the stairs, everyone stopped in their tracks, staring at the empty corridor.
0:45:52|0:46:2|The senior students who felt the other side had backed down became even more arrogant, and this short black dormitory corridor unexpectedly made them walk out of the battlefield with a killing momentum.
0:46:2|0:46:12|At the door of Huangmao's dorm, Guan Chao and Xie Xun pounded the door fiercely with a deep sense of resentment.
0:46:19|0:46:25|[Guan Chao] was puzzled as there was no movement inside the door.
0:46:40|0:47:3|There was still no movement inside the door. [Xie Xun] had already talked about it, not kicking the door would be losing face. Looking at the expectant eyes of his classmates, [Xie Xun] straightened his chest, took a few steps back, prepared to kick the door. The first kick didn't open it, then [Xie Xun] felt provoked, couldn't bear the embarrassment, and jumped up with a flying kick.
0:47:4|0:47:25|[Xie Xun] fell to the ground, [Guan Chao] led two boys charging in, a group of people swarmed in, and a big battle began. [Huangmao] and his followers were locked by several seniors and fought in the corridor together.
0:47:26|0:47:56|[Huangmao] took advantage of the chaos to grab [Monkey] by the neck. [Lin Xiangyu] watched all this with restraint. In the chaotic scene of blood and broken heads, he appeared particularly calm. He saw [Xie Xun] about to strike at [Huangmao], so he quickly went over to stop [Xie Xun]. [Lin Xiangyu] was pushed to the side by the chaotic crowd, watching as two people tangled up, three people formed a group, and the situation escalated into a heated brawl with punches, kicks, and neck twists. The sounds of punches, muffled groans, and moans in the corridor made the usually cautious [Lin Xiangyu] feel even more helpless.
0:48:4|0:48:13|Huangmao was dragged into the bathroom by Xie Xun, crying and howling like a ghost, unable to sleep all night. The next day, everyone gathered around the school bulletin board.
0:49:36|0:50:4|[Xie Xun] stood up and suddenly shook off [Lin Xiangyu]'s arm, refusing to look him in the eye. With all his strength, [Xie Xun] pushed [Lin Xiangyu] to the ground. [Lin Xiangyu] looked incredulously at the hatred on his good brother's face. Back in the dorm, [Xie Xun]'s bed was already empty, as he was packing his bags.
0:50:14|0:50:46|Two classmates walked out of the dormitory. The brothers from room 330 bid farewell. [Xie Xun] put down his luggage, looked around the dormitory interior, and casually said, pretending not to care. [Guan Chao] and [Li Dapeng] remained silent with gloomy faces. [Guan Chao] nodded, handed out cigarettes, and lit them up.
0:50:48|0:50:56|Seeing everyone bowing their heads in silence, the atmosphere of parting became even heavier. [Xie Xun] blew a smoke ring and said,
0:51:7|0:51:14|[Xie Xun] finished speaking and, as usual, naturally passed the cigarette to [Guan Chao]. [Guan Chao] took a deep drag, then angrily exhaled a puff of smoke.
0:51:24|0:51:50|Big Brother took the cigarette that Brother Guan Chao had smoked and took a puff, intending to pass it to Lin Xiangyu standing on the side. Xie Xun saw this, his face changed, and he quickly intercepted the cigarette before anyone else, angrily threw it on the ground in front of everyone's shocked eyes, and stomped out the sparks with his foot.
0:51:50|0:52:13|[Lin Xiangyu] watched as his once good friend looked down on him, not knowing how to salvage the situation. [Xie Xun] carried a pile of luggage downstairs, with [Guan Chao] and [Li Dapeng] quickly picking up the rest of the luggage to follow. [Lin Xiangyu] wanted to step forward to help, but was stopped by [Li Dapeng], leaving him alone in the dormitory with regrets. [Xie Xun] opened the door of the red car and said to a group of classmates seeing them off,
0:53:24|0:53:33|The girl in the photo is as innocent and pure as she was back then, smiling sweetly at him. At this moment, [Xie Xun] couldn't hold back anymore and started crying sadly.
0:53:47|0:53:57|As the vibrant night scene in Shanghai fades away, when dawn breaks, [Xu Meixin] walks arm in arm with [Lin Xiangyu] to the weekend Bund.
0:54:46|0:54:56|[Xu Meixin] chose the best shooting location on the Bund, took out her phone, and the two of them pouted their lips together, posing for a couple's selfie kiss.
0:55:15|0:55:42|The balloon slipped out of hand and floated away in the air above the Bund. [Lin Xiangyu] arrived at the company early in the morning, but his colleagues avoided him with unusual expressions. Susan, who met him on the Bund over the weekend, also dodged [Lin Xiangyu] with a shy smile before turning away. Susan signaled to her colleagues to keep quiet, leaving [Lin Xiangyu] puzzled. He greeted people nearby as usual, only to be avoided and dodged by everyone.
0:55:42|0:56:8|[Lin Xiangyu] sat down thankfully, [Xu Meixin] smiled brightly at him, and the office gossip group started discussing again. The instigator, Susan, quickly stopped them, noticing [Lin Xiangyu]'s confusion. [Xu Meixin] responded with a firm smile, telling him not to mind. The scene shifted to an alley in Shanghai, where [Guan Chao] was taking Lu Xiaoxiao to take the TOEFL exam. As they reached the alley entrance, the two stopped.
0:56:8|0:56:18|[Guan Chao] held his girlfriend's hand and comforted her, planting an encouraging kiss on [Du Xiaoxiao]'s forehead.
0:56:24|0:56:44|[Guan Chao] watched as [Du Xiaoxiao] turned into an alley, sneaking a glance as she walked away. He quickly turned and ran in the opposite direction, fumbling to change into black clothes in the alley. Meanwhile, [Du Xiaoxiao] was walking on the main street, while [Guan Chao], now masked and disguised as a robber, rushed towards her and grabbed her bag.
0:56:52|0:57:0|[Guan Chao] fled in panic, the familiar voice made [Du Xiaoxiao] suspicious. That night, [Du Xiaoxiao] angrily looked at the bite marks on [Guan Chao]'s hand.
0:57:58|0:58:6|[Guan Chao] retaliated by fiercely kissing [Du Xiaoxiao]'s lips. [Du Xiaoxiao] pushed [Guan Chao] away excitedly and stood up on the small wooden table on the balcony.
0:58:22|0:58:44|[Guan Chao] and [Du Xiaoxiao] ran hand in hand towards their own little home, running through the yard and across the corridor. The door opened to reveal a small but well-equipped home. Although the house was rented, their life was their own. The young couple decorated their home very warmly. Standing on the balcony filled with flowers, they embraced each other, breathing in the sweet air of love.
0:58:50|0:58:57|On the other side, [Xu Meixin] and her best friend were chatting in the swimming pool.
0:59:39|0:59:47|[Xu Meixin] heard about the intern situation and glanced quietly at [Lin Xiangyu], while Eva flipped through the forms.
0:59:57|1:0:21|[Lin Xiangyu] walked towards the tailor under the girlish smile of [Xu Meixin]. [Xu Meixin] shyly smiled at [Lin Xiangyu], Susan and Eva whispered gossip, noting down the measurement results in the form. [Lin Xiaoyu] smiled at [Xu Meixin], just about to return to his seat, but found the tailor's expression a bit off, [Xu Meixin] also felt a bit nervous.
1:0:40|1:0:47|[Lin Xiangyu] stood still, [Xu Meixin] with a serious expression, while Susan gloated and said,
1:0:48|1:0:54|[Lin Xiangyu] lowered his head and walked back to his seat under everyone's curious gaze, while [Xu Meixin] looked at [Lin Xiangyu] with a worried frown.
1:0:55|1:1:2|Xu Meixin strides quickly towards Manager Wang's office.
1:1:40|1:1:49|Manager Wang slowly got up and walked in front of Xu Meixin, paused for a moment, and solemnly said,
1:2:41|1:2:48|[Guan Chao] and [Du Xiaoxiao] are living as a young couple in a rental house. The countdown to their breakup is now only 20 days away.
1:2:54|1:3:0|Roger looked at the ewe in front of him, while the three old men beside him watched the excitement with smiles on their faces.
1:3:8|1:3:29|Life goes on for everyone, including [Xie Xun]. After dropping out of school, he still meets fellow villagers from various provinces at the train station to earn a living. With only three days left before [Guan Chao] and [Du Xiaoxiao] break up, they are ready to take the final step and experience their wedding. At the wedding ceremony, dressed in wedding attire, the two of them kissed in front of everyone's eyes.
1:3:29|1:3:44|Although everyone knew it was part of experiencing life, friends sitting in the audience smiled with blessings. [Lin Xiangyu] also touched by it, held [Xu Meixin]'s hand. The day of parting finally arrived, [Guan Chao] tore down the countdown calendar on the wall.
1:3:47|1:4:4|[Du Xiaoxiao] dare not look into [Guan Chao]'s eyes. The two of them pushed the suitcase downstairs. The taxi driver got in first, [Guan Chao] and [Du Xiaoxiao] faced each other, both awkwardly smiling.
1:4:19|1:4:30|Guan Chao's proposal caused Du Xiaoxiao's previously carefully crafted facade of relaxation to instantly crumble. He choked up and threw himself into Guan Chao's arms, the two tightly embracing and savoring the last moment of love.
1:4:30|1:4:39|The scorching sun of summer shines on the two figures, but the lovers about to part feel no warmth, only a heart-wrenching coldness.
1:4:39|1:4:47|[Guan Chao] couldn't help but listen to [Du Xiaoxiao]'s crying, tears swirling in his eyes, hand covering his mouth, trying not to cry out loud.
1:4:47|1:4:58|Suddenly, [Du Xiaoxiao] pushed [Guan Chao] away and slapped him in the face. In that moment, they seemed to have returned to the moment they first met, bonded by a slap.
1:4:58|1:5:6|The pain of ending this relationship with a big slap. Lin Xiangyu and Xu Meixin tried to watch each other with their eyes and then passionately kissed each other.
1:5:7|1:5:30|Alone, [Du Xiaoxiao] kissed and hugged [Guan Chao] as if no one was around, then pushed him away again. She turned and ran towards the taxi, leaving with reluctance and determination, leaving [Guan Chao] in the alley full of sweet memories, alone to endure the double torment brought by these memories. [Guan Chao] couldn't hold on any longer, squatting on the ground, crying like a child with tears streaming down his face.
1:5:43|1:5:58|[Xu Meixin] brought [Lin Xiangyu] to the bank of the Huangpu River, their usual dating spot. [Lin Xiangyu] affectionately hugged [Xu Meixin] from behind, but she gently broke free from his embrace, took a step back, and solemnly said,
1:7:19|1:7:25|[Lin Xiangyu] reached out and grabbed [Xu Meixin]'s hand.
1:7:56|1:8:3|[Lin Xiangyu] was almost driven to the brink of collapse by [Xu Meixin]'s arbitrary actions. He turned around, looked back angrily, and loudly reprimanded [Xu Meixin], saying,
1:8:48|1:8:56|In front of the furious and red-eyed [Lin Xiangyu], [Xu Meixin] held back her emotions with tears in her eyes, but they had just broken up.
1:9:11|1:9:18|[Lin Xiangyu] watched as [Xu Meixin] drove away, the vast Huangpu River unable to contain his sadness.
1:9:21|1:9:34|[Lin Xiangyu] walked on the street that had just been rained on, passing by the small shop where he had introduced [Xu Meixin] to his brothers. He couldn't help but stop and look inside, the former liveliness and camaraderie now all gone from him.
1:9:35|1:9:50|The table that was once filled with laughter and joy is now empty, just like his lonely and cold heart. [Lin Xiangyu] left with a heavy heart, and in the late night food stall, [Xie Xun] is eating supper alone. The boss brought beer and barbecue.
1:9:56|1:9:59|A commercial vehicle approached not far away,
1:10:2|1:10:32|Parked next to the barbecue stall, the man with Xiao Jing, [Laowu], got out of the car with a group of thugs, aggressively. He picked up an empty wine bottle from the nearby table and walked towards [Xie Xun], who had his back to them. Unaware, [Xie Xun] was still eating peanuts and edamame when he was suddenly hit on the head by the bottle. The people around scattered, and [Xie Xun] was kicked to the ground by [Laowu].
1:10:35|1:10:50|Bleeding and battered, [Xie Xun] lay on the ground in pain, struggling to get up with a fierce look on his face. Fearlessly, he stood in front of the thugs as [Laowu] rushed over to kick him. However, [Xie Xun] grabbed his leg and pushed him several meters away.
1:10:52|1:11:25|After a few punches, the group of thugs finally realized what was happening. They quickly surrounded [Xie Xun], who had kicked away, and helped [Laowu] up. Several thugs began to attack [Xie Xun], who was fighting six or seven of them alone, struggling to hold on. The boss of the barbecue stall quietly dialed the police while [Lin Xiangyu], who was heartbroken over love, walked past the barbecue stall. Drawn by the commotion, he stopped and saw [Xie Xun] being surrounded by a group of people.
1:11:25|1:11:42|[Lin Xiangyu] Xiaoyu frowned, quickly rushed forward and picked up a stool, helping up the fallen [Xie Xun]. Ye Xun was surprised to see Lin [Lin Xiangyu] with a puzzled look on his face. The good brothers who once had grievances now joined the battle together.
1:11:42|1:12:1|Two people performed shoulder throws and flying leg sweeps, but after a few moves, they were ultimately overwhelmed by the group. Back to back in the middle of the circle, with a determined look on [Xie Xun]'s face and [Lin Xiangyu] covered in injuries, they braced themselves for the final battle. Amid the deafening thunder, they engaged in a fierce fight with the henchmen, but quickly found themselves at a disadvantage.
1:12:1|1:12:12|The thugs worked together, lifting up [Xie Xun] and [Lin Xiangyu], targeting vital points with their punches, landing hard on their faces, heads, and stomachs. Both of them were knocked unconscious by the heavy blows.
1:12:22|1:12:28|The assailant walked towards the business car with a victorious posture, thunder roaring and lightning briefly illuminating the sky.
1:12:34|1:12:41|In the pouring rain, Lin Xiangyu and Xu Meixin helped each other up and struggled to stand.
1:13:58|1:14:5|Walking up the abandoned building where they used to have dinners together,
1:14:27|1:14:44|The city lights at their feet were particularly dazzling in the night, as four bruised and swollen brothers sat around a charcoal fire drinking wine, chatting like they did back in school.
1:15:8|1:15:29|[Lin Xiangyu] did not comment on these words, shook his head, raised the beer bottle and drank it, the brothers no longer persuaded, the four of them raised their bottles, clinked glasses and drank heavily, our love lives are all quite unsuccessful.
1:15:29|1:15:35|[Xie Xun] remembered the neat mirror tattooed on his left arm during the most painful time of his heartbreak.
1:15:41|1:16:5|[Guan Chao] also recalled the first encounter with [Du Xiaoxiao] as if it were just yesterday. In [Lin Xiangyu]'s memory, there was a childhood photo of a chance meeting with [Xu Meixin], and the sweet smile of [Xu Meixin] in his arms. The charcoal fire in front of them kept burning, the brothers fell asleep in a daze, and the night passed without a word.
1:16:5|1:16:14|The next morning, Li Dapeng heard the honking of a car outside and ran to the edge of the building to see. As the light outside gradually brightened, Li Dapeng turned around to call his brothers.
1:16:17|1:16:28|Four people stood side by side at the edge of the building, looking at the gradually awakening city. It was Shanghai in the early morning, a sight they had never seen before.
1:16:37|1:17:2|[Xie Xun] lit a cigarette, took a puff, and naturally passed it to [Lin Xiangyu] next to him. Then he yanked off the necklace around his neck, opened it to look at the photo of Xiao Jing inside. [Xie Xun] exerted all his strength to throw the necklace away, finally letting go.
1:17:12|1:17:24|After finishing speaking, [Lin Xiangyu] took a deep drag of his cigarette and handed it to the person next to him, [Li Dapeng], who then spoke slowly.
1:17:42|1:17:51|After a while, accompanied by a group of white doves flying into the sky, the students also threw their mortarboards into the air. They finally welcomed their graduation.
1:18:2|1:18:14|On the playground, [Xie Xun] is taking graduation photos for his brothers, leaving behind the last memories of their student days. On the first day of work, [Lin Xiangyu] stands neatly in a suit with shiny hair under the company building.
1:19:28|1:19:47|Under the leadership of [Manager Wang], everyone sincerely appreciates this brave and confident young man, standing up and applauding, sending their blessings. As they walk out of the company building, it's almost dusk, but [Lin Xiangyu]'s life is just beginning. He slings his backpack over his shoulder, still smiling like a youth as he charges into the crowd.
1:19:47|1:19:58|The next day, he smiled brightly and joined the crowd of graduates as they surged into the talent recruitment fair, starting anew to seek job opportunities on his own.
1:19:59|1:20:8|The life of the rich second generation [Li Dapeng] is much more comfortable. He leisurely bought two ice creams at a roadside shop, but when he turned around, he found that the alpaca Roger was missing.
1:20:10|1:20:18|[Li Dapeng] started to search along the roadside. He saw the passersby around him discussing the cuteness of alpacas, so he quickly stepped forward and asked,
1:20:23|1:20:48|Following the directions of passersby, [Li Dapeng] ran over and found outside a boutique, Roger the alpaca was leaning against a female alpaca, gently rubbing his neck. Holding the female alpaca's lead was a girl wearing a pearl necklace, smiling as she stroked Roger's head. The girl looked up, smiled at [Li Dapeng], who blushed and nervously handed over the just-bought ice cream. The girl chuckled and actually took it.
1:20:48|1:21:10|Another beautiful beginning, in the dormitory of Du Xiaoxiao in Los Angeles, USA, Du Xiaoxiao's roommate is chatting on the side, while Du Xiaoxiao is sitting on her bed packing the luggage she brought from China. Suddenly she notices something extra, it's the big kitchen knife that Guan Chao always carries with him, unexpectedly crossing the ocean to follow her.
1:21:10|1:21:17|Du Xiaoxiao burst into tears, excitedly opening the package.
1:21:26|1:21:39|While Lu Xiaoxiao was feeling melancholic, [Guan Chao] in Shanghai was also contemplating the amulet that once belonged to Lu Xiaoxiao, reminiscing about the past. Despite the distance between them, their hearts were connected.
1:21:40|1:22:5|On the other side, [Xie Xun] was washing his second-hand car in the alley. [Xie Xun] froze upon hearing a familiar voice and name, and it took a long time for him to slowly get up. Turning back to look at Xiao Jing in front of him, his eyes showed complex emotions, with a mix of nostalgia and resentment.
1:22:5|1:22:9|Xiao Jing stood still and gave a slight smile to [Xie Xun], just like the quiet and beautiful times when they were young.
1:22:12|1:22:26|Xie Xun noticed Lin Xiangyu's flat stomach, and Lin Xiangyu lowered her head and said softly.
1:22:27|1:22:34|Xie Xun bit his lip tightly, turned away in pain, and looked into Du Xiaoxiao's eyes filled with tears, watching the big boy in front of him.
1:22:52|1:23:10|[Jing] turned around and dragged the suitcase away. Xie Xun rushed forward and grabbed her hand from behind, hesitated for a moment, and finally spoke.
1:23:14|1:23:18|Xiao Jing looked at the car, then at Xie Xun's sincere face, and was moved.
1:23:19|1:23:26|So Xie Xun drove to take Du Xiaoxiao home, and they smiled at each other as if all the past unpleasantness had disappeared.
1:23:26|1:23:36|The car slowly drove on the bustling overpass in Shanghai, bidding farewell to [Xiao Jing] and also bidding farewell to the youthful confusion and pent-up anger in Xie Xun's heart.
1:23:37|1:24:1|A year later, on a busy morning in Shanghai, the small eatery on the street exuded the homely atmosphere of ordinary families. Dressed in a work uniform, [Lin Xiangyu] emerged from the breakfast shop window with steamed buns and porridge. Just as he finished setting up the breakfast outside, he saw a small car approaching him on the street. Quickly, [Lin Xiangyu] waved his hand and shouted,
1:24:4|1:24:11|The car slowly stopped by the roadside, and a long-haired beauty in professional attire got out of the car and walked gracefully towards [Lin Xiangyu].
1:24:11|1:24:19|It was Xu Meixin who looked at Lin Xiangyu, who had already ordered breakfast, and Xu Meixin smiled and said a sentence.
1:24:53|1:24:57|[Lin Xiangyu] takes the helmet handed to him by [Li Dapeng] and puts it on.
1:25:9|1:25:14|Driving over the bustling overpass, the big boys waving their arms in the wind laughed heartily under the scorching sun, heading towards the once most familiar place, their alma mater.
