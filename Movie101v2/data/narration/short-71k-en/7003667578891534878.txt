0:3:0|0:3:16|He approached the woman, took out a lipstick and drew something on her face. The two quickly pulled [Xiao Bo] away for evacuation, while [Tong Tong] hurriedly took the guitar and left. A cross suddenly appeared on the woman's face.
0:3:52|0:3:57|Fireworks for the New Year burst in the sky, and the sports car suddenly stops in the suburbs across the bridge.
0:4:6|0:4:28|[A Jie] got off the car and said anxiously, while [Tong Tong] looked around. The screen went black, marking the end of the opening part of the movie. Based on the original work by Keigo Higashino, "The Miracles of the Namiya General Store" stars Wang Junkai, Dilraba Dilmurat, Li Hongqi, and Dong Zijian, with a special appearance by Qin Hao, and guest appearances by Pan Binlong, Cheng Taishen, Yan Xiaopin, and Gao Huayang.

0:4:58|0:5:14|Three of them abandoned the car and walked to find the way. [A Jie] ran in the front, [Xiao Bo] carried a bag and also held the bag of the tied-up woman, while [Tong Tong] followed closely with a guitar. As they got closer to the intersection, the number of houses decreased, and the nearby buildings were separated by small crossroads, all looking a bit rundown.
0:5:14|0:5:34|At the T-junction stands a two-story old building, which serves as both a shop and a residence. The house is not big, with colorful advertisements pasted on the rolling shutter of the shop. Faintly visible on the signboard are the words "grocery store", giving the impression that it is uninhabited. The three of them stop at the door of the shop, looking around. [Tong Tong] scratches her head and asks,
0:5:40|0:6:1|Three of them arrived at the front of the store, looking up at the sign. The sign read "Unnamed Variety Store". [Tong Tong] walked to the side with a guitar on her back, while [A Jie] noticed the protruding mailbox on the wall. He pulled it out and found it empty. [Tong Tong] turned into the alley next to the house alone. [A Jie] picked up his phone and checked the time, the screen showed 23:58, with a screensaver of a photo of the three of them.
0:6:1|0:6:26|[Tong Tong] walked around to the back door, where there was a milk box. She signaled for the other two to come over. [Xiao Bo] picked up the lock on the gate, checked it, and then reached into his bag. [A Jie] picked up a brick from the side of the road, looking awkward as he held it. [Xiao Bo] pushed open the gate, revealing another wooden door inside. He took out tools from his bag and started working on the door, while [Tong Tong] kept watch. The old wooden door was finally opened.
0:6:26|0:6:52|[Tong Tong] stepped up the stairs and entered first, [A Jie] peeked in and asked, then he also walked in, the wooden floor creaked. [Tong Tong] lifted the curtain and looked inside, only to see old display cabinets and shelves. [Xiao Bo] put away his tools and looked up, the full moon was right above. He paced with one foot next to the other, as if measuring the distance. The sudden sound of a clock startled [A Jie], the source of the sound was an old grandfather clock. [A Jie] mocked [Tong Tong].
0:6:54|0:7:1|At this moment, the clock points to midnight, [Tong Tong] fiercely pats [A Jie] on the back, and [Xiao Bo] also walks in and gives [A Jie] a pat.
0:7:3|0:7:25|[A Jie] patted the mailbox, then rang the bell above it. [Xiao Bo] saw the calendar on the wall suddenly calling for companions. [A Jie] took out his phone, there was no electricity in the house. [Xiao Bo] lit several candles. [Tong Tong] asked while pressing her forehead,
0:7:44|0:7:58|The bell on the wall suddenly rang, and a folded piece of paper dropped into the letter box. [Tong Tong] stood up and walked quickly towards the letter box. [A Jie] hesitated before standing up, and [Tong Tong] boldly reached out to take the letter from the envelope. The three of them gathered around the letter.
0:8:6|0:8:20|[Tong Tong] first opened the door and looked around, then ran towards the front door. [Tong Tong] hesitated for a moment, then bumped into [Xiao Bo] with her elbow.
0:8:33|0:8:41|[A Jie] ran outside to observe the surroundings. From the gentle slope, he could see the lights of many households in the distance, but there was no one around him.
0:8:58|0:9:17|[A Jie] sighed with his back to the shop, then turned to glance at it, only to be surprised and look back again. Under the moonlight, the grocery store gradually lit up, as if enveloped in an aurora. [A Jie] blinked in disbelief as the entire store shimmered with a moonlight-like glow, and the bright yellow title of "The Comfort Store" gradually appeared in front of the house.
0:9:19|0:9:28|[Tong Tong] picked up the old newspaper on the table, with a photo of an old man and a grocery store in the center. The headline next to the photo read "The Comfort Store".
0:10:16|0:10:21|[A Jie] lay heavily on the sofa in the inner room, the wall clock still pointing to midnight.
0:10:31|0:10:39|Tong Tong, who was leaning on the table, looked up and asked Xiao Bo. Xiao Bo glanced at her, and Tong Tong lowered her eyes and whispered,
0:11:24|0:11:35|[Tong Tong] closed her eyes in silence and lay on the table, [A Jie] put the letter in the milk box, opened the door curtain and walked into the room, [Tong Tong] and [Xiao Bo] hurriedly greeted him, staring at him together.
0:11:41|0:11:49|[Tong Tong] took out an envelope with the signature "Musician of the Small Town" on it, while the milk carton was empty.
0:12:14|0:12:39|[A Jie] went out again to put the letter in the milk box, with [Tong Tong] following him. They hid behind some abandoned furniture not far away, staring intently at the milk box. The sound startled [A Jie], causing him to shrink into a ball. [Xiao Bo] raised his hand to show them the new letter, and the two hurriedly rushed forward to open the milk box, only to find it empty again.
0:12:51|0:12:59|[A Jie] quickly rushed to the coffee table, shaking everything out of the woman's bag onto the table. [A Jie] impatiently threw down the empty wallet.
0:13:10|0:13:34|[Tong Tong] held onto the window frame, watching [A Jie] leave. The night market outside was bustling. [A Jie] raised his collar to cover his face, then bought a bunch of snacks at the convenience store. He casually glanced at the electronic clock on the wall, which showed 00:08. Puzzled, he blinked and then searched for an unnamed grocery store on his phone at the convenience store entrance, finding a post on a forum.
0:13:34|0:13:47|The announcement states that the consultation window of the Nameless Grocery Store will be resurrected from the early morning of January 1, 2018. Friends who have consulted the grocery store in the past and received a reply are requested to submit a letter to inform.
0:13:47|0:13:55|Did the reply at that time affect your life? I hope everyone can speak frankly, just like back then. Suddenly,
0:13:55|0:14:12|The phone screen automatically goes black. Despite pressing the home button, [A Jie] gets no response. He returns to the grocery store with snacks in hand. [Tong Tong] and [Xiao Bo], who were leaning on the table asleep, suddenly stand up. [Xiao Bo] quickly opens a pack of cookies.
0:15:17|0:15:27|[Tong Tong] and [Xiao Bo] wrote another letter and put it in the milk box. When they opened the box again, the letter was still there. [Tong Tong] said to [Xiao Bo],
0:15:29|0:15:41|After silently reciting three numbers, Xiao Bo and Tong Tong opened the milk carton, only to find the letter missing. They looked at each other in shock, when suddenly a bell rang and another letter dropped from the mailbox.
0:16:38|0:16:52|[Tong Tong] completely ignored [A Jie], picked up a pen and wrote a reply. She looked at the letter in her hand, sighed helplessly, then walked out of the house and closed the back door. Glancing at the envelope in her hand, she opened the milk box lid and stuffed the letter inside.
0:16:55|0:17:5|As the letter slowly falls into the milk box, time quickly reverses, the mottled paint inside the box is restored to its original state, and the gaps in the wooden boards become seamless.
0:17:5|0:17:12|Chapter One "Musicians in a Small Town". Someone opened the milk box.
0:17:12|0:17:18|A man with pointed hair reaches out and takes out an envelope.
0:17:28|0:17:41|In 1990 Beijing, [Qin Lang] dressed up, holding a guitar, walked out of the door. Outside the door, someone was washing up by the tap. This is a large courtyard where the drifting youth live.
0:17:45|0:17:51|A curly-haired young man approaches the girl,
0:18:39|0:18:44|A few young people are rehearsing a play outside the door, [Qin Lang] walks out of the gate pushing his bicycle.
0:18:55|0:19:10|The old lady next to the gate kept asking the man who was painting, [Qin Lang] rode his bike through the alleyways. He rode past Tiananmen Square, and the man with glasses next to him also rode a bike with a child placed on the crossbar of the bike. Inside the recording studio, the producer was shouting into the microphone.
0:20:19|0:20:52|[Qin Lang] suddenly took off his headphones, grabbed his guitar and rushed out of the recording studio, while the people inside laughed heartily. Gasping for breath, [Qin Lang] smashed a beer bottle in front of the courtyard, casting a sidelong glance at the crowd inside. The Beijing Exhibition Hall was crowded with people, with a poster above the gate that read "Cui Jian Beijing Concert". Most people were wearing Cui Jian's iconic red five-pointed star hat, holding up posters and shouting Cui Jian's name loudly.
0:20:52|0:20:59|[Qin Lang] was squeezed against the glass door by the crowd, watching the crazy fans rushing towards Cui Jian for autographs. Cui Jian waved his hand at the door.
0:21:9|0:21:18|In 1993 Beijing, the male neighbor with a low ponytail shouted for [Qin Lang] at the door, hugged him tightly, then handed him a ticket.
0:21:47|0:21:56|The curly-haired youth, Xiao Bo, who was heartbroken, released the pigeons and lay on the roof.
0:22:6|0:22:32|[Qin Lang] answered the phone, his impatient expression subtly changed. He boarded the green train back to his hometown, watching the scenery outside the window quickly retreat. As the door opened at home, Qin Tian looked somewhat puzzled at [Qin Lang] outside. His mother hurriedly came to greet him.
0:22:39|0:23:12|Qin Tian helped his father sit up in bed, [Qin Lang] looked to the side, his father frowned and said, [Qin Lang] glanced at his father and then at his mother, in the room [Qin Lang] flipped through the music scores and lyrics he had collected, Qin Tian asked, [Qin Lang] turned his head without saying a word, Qin Tian watched him walk to the window, leaning against it, [Qin Lang] looked outside and let out a sigh.
0:23:21|0:23:39|[Qin Lang] walked unsteadily into the Huazi music store, where Huazi was organizing cassette tapes. When Huazi saw [Qin Lang], he was both surprised and delighted. He shook his shoulders to mimic an electric shock passing through him, and [Qin Lang] made the same movement and high-fived him. The two of them clinked glasses in the store.
0:23:39|0:23:44|On the table were dozens of beer bottles. Hua Zi put down a beer bottle and asked. [Qin Lang] held the bottle and opened his mouth.
0:24:5|0:24:13|Hua Zi took the newspaper from the side and handed it to [Qin Lang]. [Qin Lang] looked at the newspaper and seemed to remember something, then asked.
0:24:29|0:24:36|[Qin Lang]'s smile gradually disappeared, licking his lips thoughtfully, then arrived at the front door of the nameless grocery store, with a bewildered look.
0:24:47|0:24:58|After he finished writing the letter, he threw it into the mailbox and looked up at the sky. The video store was filled with cassette tapes, CDs, and posters. Hua Zi and a young couple were engrossed in watching TV.
0:24:58|0:25:6|The storefront's French windows are adorned with large red characters, "Specializing in the rental and sale of videotapes". [Qin Lang] gently strums his guitar on the steps outside the door.
0:25:6|0:25:16|The clock in the shop points to 8 o'clock, [Qin Lang] wearing a denim jacket, opens the milk box, looks around, and takes out the letter inside.
0:25:16|0:25:24|He furrowed his brow, looking at the unfamiliar words in the letter. At the dining table at home,
0:25:42|0:25:48|[Qin Lang] clinked glasses with his father, drank up the wine in one gulp, and his gaze shifted from side to side as he spoke.
0:26:10|0:26:19|The father angrily slammed the wine glass, his anger spilling all over the table. [Qin Lang] looked defiantly to the side, put down his chopsticks, and turned back to his room.
0:26:29|0:26:42|[Qin Lang] angrily crumpled the letter and threw it next to the tree roots. The emergency room door was lit with a red light. [Qin Lang] kicked his flip-flops and made his way through the bustling crowd at the hospital. He rushed up the stairs three steps at a time, panting heavily as he ran down the corridor.
0:26:42|0:26:51|Second Aunt saw [Qin Lang] and patted Qin's mother. [Qin Lang] nodded towards Second Uncle, and Qin Tian called [Qin Lang] aside, asking sternly.
0:26:59|0:27:10|Qin Tian helped his mother up from the bench, and she walked over to [Qin Lang] and glanced at him without saying a word. Qin Tian hugged his mother from behind as she looked out the window and quietly sobbed.
0:27:10|0:27:16|The red light in the emergency room went out,
0:27:48|0:28:7|[Qin Lang] hid outside the ward and listened to the conversation, feeling extremely conflicted. Inside the bedroom, [Qin Lang] signed his name on the guitar with a white marker, as if bidding farewell to it. After finishing, he slowly raised his head, pursed his lips, and his eyes seemed to lose their sparkle. [Qin Lang] put the guitar into its case.
0:28:15|0:28:36|[Qin Lang] pulled out a letter from the grocery store's mailbox. The bell inside the house rang, and [Tong Tong] and the others quickly ran to the mailbox. [Qin Lang] seemed to hear a noise inside the house, so he retracted his hand holding the letter. [Xiao Bo] lay down by the mailbox and looked outside. [Qin Lang] left half of the letter outside, closed the mailbox, leaned against the wall, and took out the harmonica from his pocket.
0:28:58|0:29:27|Tong Tong listened to the familiar melody, then suddenly patted A Jie's arm. The harmonica sound passed by Qin Lang from 1993 and arrived in the grocery store in 2018. Qin Lang played the harmonica devoutly, and at the end he stuffed the entire letter into the mailbox. The envelope passed through the tunnel of time, flashing green light as it fell into the letter basket below the receiving slot.
0:29:29|0:29:56|[Xiao Bo], who was guarding the mailbox, immediately picked up the envelope, unfolded the letter, and [Tong Tong] and [A Jie] gathered around to read the contents of the letter. After [Tong Tong] finished reading, looking somewhat shocked, [A Jie] nodded slightly. The three of them recalled the story of rebirth, feeling very low and silent. Suddenly, [Tong Tong] exclaimed, hesitated to speak, and then [Xiao Bo] continued.
0:29:58|0:30:22|[Tong Tong] looked at [Xiao Bo], lowered her eyes and fell silent. The milk carton was opened again, with a note inside saying "For the small town musician". [Qin Lang] took out the note and stared at it blankly. As he turned back, he heard a sound of vomiting. There was a drunken woman next to the utility pole. [Qin Lang] sat on the train back to Beijing, looking out the window.
0:30:51|0:31:16|Qin Lang's tears welled up in the corners of his eyes as his father stared at him. With red eyes, tears uncontrollably streamed down Qin Lang's face. In the darkness of the night, the train roared into the station. Three years later, at the Rainbow House, Qin Lang played the guitar and sang.
0:33:4|0:33:17|[Qin Lang] walked through the corridor with a guitar in his arms. As he was about to enter the room, he glanced at the rooftop and seemed to have seen something. He pushed open the door to the rooftop and walked slowly to [Zhang Weiwei]'s side.
0:33:20|0:33:35|[Zhang Weiwei] was leaning against the railing on the rooftop with her back to him, her left and right feet wearing socks of different colors. [Qin Lang] looked away from the socks, plucked the strings of the guitar, and it was only when [Zhang Weiwei] heard the sound of the guitar that she noticed [Qin Lang].
0:34:36|0:34:52|In his sleep, [Qin Lang] was suddenly awakened by screams. The Rainbow House was on fire, and [Qin Lang] hastily put on his pants as [Zhang Yi] carried the child out of the flames.
0:34:58|0:35:25|[Qin Lang] heard the cries for help, handed the guitar to [Zhang Yi], turned and rushed down the corridor. He kicked open the dormitory door, where [Zhang Weiwei] was crouched in a corner with her head buried. [Qin Lang] pulled her out of bed, the blanket soaked in the washbasin, covered [Zhang Weiwei]'s face with the blanket, carried her out of the room. Flames flickered, smoke filled the air, the burnt beams fell from the roof, narrowly missing [Qin Lang] as he shielded [Zhang Weiwei] and continued to rush outside. The terrifying smoke in the corridor seemed to engulf everything.
0:35:25|0:35:38|[Qin Lang] coughed violently, his face covered in burn marks. Finally, [Qin Lang] staggered out of the corridor filled with photos, placed the wrapped [Zhang Weiwei] on the ground, and slowly collapsed to the side.
0:35:42|0:36:5|[Zhang Weiwei] grabbed [Qin Lang]'s shoulder and shouted loudly, but [Qin Lang] covered his chest without making a sound. The door at the end of the corridor behind him spewed out flames, [Zhang Yi] rushed over and helped [Zhang Weiwei] lift [Qin Lang] up. [Qin Lang] was carried outside, his eyes unfocused, too weak to even cough. The children surrounded him, silently shedding tears, while [Zhang Weiwei] tightly held his hand, crying uncontrollably.
0:36:5|0:36:11|[Qin Lang] remembered the reply from the grocery store.
0:36:51|0:36:57|Singer [Zhang Weiwei] is wearing a pure white shirt. She lowers her eyes, raises her hand and grips the microphone in front of her.
0:37:21|0:37:31|[Zhang Weiwei] had tears in her eyes, she turned her face away and pinched her nose, but couldn't stop the tears from sliding down her cheeks.
0:38:3|0:38:9|Chapter One ends, Chapter Two "Grandpa Solves Worries and Mr. Jackson".
0:38:9|0:38:16|Grandpa from the nameless grocery store pushed open the rolling shutter, holding a stack of paper in his left hand and supporting the shelf at the door with his right hand, walking out of the store unsteadily.
0:38:17|0:38:25|A primary school student runs over and asks.
0:38:25|0:38:52|Beside the shop, at the entrance of an alley, there is a blackboard with several pieces of paper pinned to it. Grandpa walks to the blackboard, picks up the pushpins from the groove, and starts pinning the papers one by one. These papers contain the worries written by the children and the answers written by grandpa, such as why sometimes jealousy arises when others are better than oneself, while other times admiration arises. Grandpa's answer is admiration from afar, jealousy up close, and so on.
0:38:52|0:38:56|When Grandpa returned to the shop, a female journalist suddenly rushed up.
0:39:2|0:39:8|Grandpa took small steps forward with a bag in his hand,
0:39:29|0:39:43|Grandpa widened his eyes, being flashed by the camera's flash. In the pavilion of the park, Xiao Bo, wearing headphones, imitated Michael Jackson's dance moves, and a burst of laughter came from nearby.
0:39:43|0:39:50|Hao Bo took off his headphones and found several male classmates pointing at him, laughing and imitating him. [Hao Bo] roared in anger.
0:39:51|0:40:16|In the grocery store, the grandfather played with his pocket watch to amuse the cat. He tied the letter securely with a thin string, gently stroked the cat's head, pulled the small stool against the wall a bit, and unsteadily climbed onto it. Placing the letter box on top of the cabinet, he leaned against the glass window. Xiao Bo stood in front of the shelves, holding a few stickers in his hand. The grandfather saw him and smiled, asking.
0:40:20|0:40:34|Hao Bo took out a few one yuan bills from his pocket and placed them on the counter, quickly picked up the stickers, [Hao Bo] just kept looking at the stickers in his hand and walked out of the shop door. An old skinny man walked in and said,
0:40:50|0:40:55|Outside the shop, a few children are scribbling on the wall with colored chalk.
0:41:1|0:41:26|Grandpa pretended to scare them, the children scattered, Xiao Bo seriously lay on the stool drawing with a pencil, sweat soaking his forehead, he pasted Michael Jackson's photo on the envelope, put the letter in the pocket of his shirt, Xiao Bo leaned against the pillar of the pavilion and sighed deeply, at night, Grandpa pulled down the rolling shutter of the grocery store, the shutter stopped one foot above the ground, and Grandpa stepped on it firmly with his foot.
0:41:26|0:41:34|[Haobo] sat in the shop opposite and walked over, looked around at the letterbox, and secretly stuffed the letter with a Jackson sticker into the mailbox.
0:41:34|0:41:56|In the alley outside the shop, the grandfather struggled to step on a Coca-Cola box filled with empty bottles and put it on the shelf. Xiao Bo turned around and saw the grandfather, immediately ran away. The grandfather looked at Xiao Bo's back with some confusion. Inside the shop, the grandfather picked up a small envelope from the envelope, which was pasted with a Jackson sticker the size of an ID photo. The grandfather tore open the sticker and unfolded the letter.
0:41:56|0:42:4|It was a pencil drawing of a child and a tree, with the signature being a portrait of [Jackson].
0:42:4|0:42:42|In Yimin Street, [Xiao Bo] briskly walked into a side alley with a backpack on his back. He arrived at the music store, reached up and took down the Jackson album. [Xiao Bo] flipped through the album in his hand, bypassed the shelves with CDs and tapes, and bounced to the counter. [Xiao Bo] lowered his head and took out the money from his pocket, placing it on the counter one by one to count. He blankly looked up, took back all the money on the counter, and walked away.
0:42:45|0:42:52|Hua Zi called out to him, gesturing for him to come back and twirling a pen, asked,
0:43:8|0:43:24|Haobo walked up to his own mansion with an album in hand. In the window of a van parked outside, a hand holding a cigarette extended out, startling Haobo, who carefully slipped away.
0:43:42|0:44:8|Hao Bo walked towards the room without looking back. [Mother] helped Hao Bo up the stairs and took off his shirt for him. As soon as he entered the room, Hao Bo locked [Mother] outside the door, put the disc into the CD player, turned the volume to the maximum. [Mother] looked anxiously downstairs as Hao Bo lay on the floor with his legs crossed, his bedroom walls covered with posters of Jackson.
0:44:8|0:44:15|[Father] shouted impatiently. [Mother] hurriedly knocked on the door.
0:44:17|0:44:22|Hao Bo ignored it, lying on the cushion with his hands on his head. [Mother] ran downstairs to talk to the creditor.
0:44:50|0:45:13|The creditor yawned and pointed with his index finger. Unable to withstand the continuous knocking, Haobo got up and opened the door. [Father] came in angrily, pushed Haobo, took out the disc and slammed it on the ground. Then he raised his hand and slapped Haobo. [Mother] hurried in and comforted Haobo.
0:45:20|0:45:40|Hao Bo tenderly uses correction fluid to cover the part of the disc that was scratched. He puts the disc back into the case, closes the lid, and Xiao Jun caresses the image of Michael Jackson on the cover. Xiao Jun gets out of the red car parked outside the grocery store and walks into the shop, shouting, "..."
0:46:54|0:47:9|Hao Bo found a letter on the blackboard outside the store. Below the blackboard, he saw a note instructing him to get the letter from the milk box. After opening the milk box and making sure no one was around, he took the letter.
0:47:35|0:47:42|[Ma Dongmei] is packing up clothes and luggage, while [Xiao Bo] asks suspiciously,
0:47:59|0:48:13|Hao Bo returned to the bedroom and put down his backpack. He looked at the cabinet, his brows furrowing gradually as he saw it empty. Suddenly, he turned around and opened the door, [Mother] was standing outside.
0:48:45|0:48:52|Hao Bo looked at [Father], who looked up and said.
0:50:11|0:50:42|Idol scandals linger in the air, as [Xiao Bo] effortlessly pulls off the red scarf tied around his arm. A muffled thunderclap echoes in the sky, waves crashing against the sandy shore. [Xiao Bo] sits on the beach with his knees hugged to his chest, a backpack beside him, thrown into the backseat of a car by his parents.
0:50:42|0:50:59|On a rainy night, Xiao Bo's parents drove into a gas station. After glancing at his mother, Xiao Bo's father opened the door and got out of the car to walk towards the gas pump in the pouring rain. In the distance, the prominent words "gasoline" were displayed on the iron mesh. Qin Lang asked, but the mother didn't know what to say.
0:51:30|0:51:55|[Xiao Bo] covered his head with his hands, walked to the entrance of the gas station restroom, stood still and looked back, then sneaked into the men's restroom. With water dripping from his forehead, [Xiao Bo] leaned against the door as his father walked into the restroom holding an umbrella. His father glanced at the rain from under the eaves, pulled up his collar to shield his head, and rushed into the rain. [Xiao Bo] then walked out of the men's restroom.
0:52:8|0:52:31|[Xiao Bo] watched as his parents, who were arguing in the distance, suddenly rushed towards the wall of the gas station. Stepping on the gaps between oil drums and bricks, he climbed up the wall with one leg propped on top. Looking back at his parents' car with lightning flashing, rain and tears mixed on [Xiao Bo]'s face. He agilely flipped over the wall and leaped down.
0:52:34|0:52:45|Grandpa at the entrance of the grocery store looked at the newspaper with a smile. In the center of the newspaper was a photo of him being interviewed standing at the store entrance. Grandpa smiled as he flipped through the newspaper, but his smile gradually disappeared on the other side.
0:52:45|0:53:4|Grandpa fixed his gaze on a news report about a family of three who couldn't repay their high-interest loan and tragically died while fleeing. His pupils trembled as he set down the newspaper, then hurriedly arranged a small stool, stepped on it to reach the top of the cabinet where a box of letters was kept. In his haste, he accidentally knocked over the box, causing letters to scatter all over the floor and himself to fall down.
0:53:4|0:53:11|Grandpa, ignoring the pain, knelt among the pile of letters, searching desperately. He picked up a few letters in a panic.
0:53:11|0:53:37|Not willing to just push away the envelope at hand, Grandpa finally picked up a letter with a Jackson portrait on it. He anxiously moved to the counter and opened another letter, which was a pencil drawing depicting a villa and a couple. Grandpa's eyes dimmed, and he weakly hung his hands holding the drawing on the counter. He breathed uneasily, as if he had lost something important.
0:53:37|0:53:57|In the train station ticket hall, with few passengers around, [Xiao Bo] was lying on a bench. Upon hearing the voice of the police officer, [Xiao Bo] quickly slid under the bench.
0:54:9|0:54:21|The lights in the hall went out, and the police officer lit up a flashlight to carefully inspect every corner of the hall. Suddenly, he spotted [Xiao Bo] crouching under the bench. The officer walked slowly towards [Xiao Bo] and shone the flashlight on his face.
0:54:45|0:54:54|The police officer stood up and walked out of the security room, closing the door behind him. The man whose hand was trapped on the radiator reminded [Hao Bo].
0:54:58|0:55:16|[Haobo] looked out the window, then at the man. With his approval, he immediately gained confidence and climbed onto the bench to open the window, sure that the police were not behind him. The man continued to encourage him to escape. [Haobo] decisively climbed out of the window, leaving the man locked inside, feeling quite pleased with himself.
0:55:16|0:55:32|[Xiao Bo] walked along the corridor outside the window, looking down to see a concrete brick open space below. He ran to the other side and looked down, where there was a large cart stacked with goods. [Xiao Bo] waved his thin arms and legs over the railing, and without hesitation, jumped down towards the large cart.
0:55:32|0:55:41|He rolled down from the goods bag on the cart,
0:55:43|0:56:12|Under the bridge, several children humming nursery rhymes appeared. They were carrying bamboo baskets and picking up plastic bottles. When Zhang Weiwei picked up a bottle, she suddenly found a boy popping out of a nearby cardboard box. The unkempt [Hao Bo] stared at the children. Zhang lit a match to light a candle, and a group of children gathered around him.
0:56:40|0:56:49|The children of Rainbow House clap together.
0:57:26|0:57:43|Grandpa picked up the newspaper on the table and gestured for Xiao Jun to read it. Xiao Jun took the newspaper, scanned it up and down, and said, "Yes."
0:58:41|0:59:6|Grandpa nodded silently, put on his coat and walked out of the shop. Passing by the blackboard with the letter paper, he stopped and looked at the letter on the blackboard for a moment. Then he turned around and followed Xiao Jun out, while the letter paper on the blackboard fluttered in the wind.
0:59:6|0:59:19|Grandpa's unnamed grocery store is still in its original location, with the summer sun shining on the big tree in front of the store. The leaves of the tree have changed from light green to dark green, and the flowers on the balcony are vibrant in color.
0:59:19|0:59:39|In autumn, the plants around the grocery store began to wither, with cold winds blowing, creating a desolate scene. Leaves were drifting in the wind, signaling the arrival of winter. Pedestrians on the road were wrapped tightly in their coats, as snowflakes fell on the path in front of the shop. The roof and the front of the store were covered in snow, and the darkening sky added to the gloomy atmosphere.
0:59:39|0:59:51|Late at night. Half a year later, [Xiao Jun] was driving the car, with his grandfather sitting in the passenger seat.
1:0:28|1:0:52|[Xiao Jun] shook his head with a smile, thinking his grandfather was talking nonsense. The car stopped steadily in front of the grocery store. Inside, [Xiao Jun] turned the calendar to December 31, 1993, and clipped the previous pages on top. He wandered around the living room and saw a newspaper on the coffee table. Bending down, he picked up the newspaper and unfolded it. [Xiao Jun] unfolded the newspaper to find his grandfather's interview printed on it.
1:0:52|1:1:12|He carefully folded the newspaper and put it back in place, then ran his hand over the table. Everything in the room remained as it was when his grandfather left. Xiao Bo saw his grandfather waiting in front of the mailbox.
1:1:29|1:1:55|[Xiao Jun] strides up the stairs, the hour hand of the old standing clock pointing to 12 o'clock, with only two minutes left until the hour strikes. The pendulum of the clock swings, and at 12:00, the chime rings. The bell above the mail slot also rings, causing Grandpa to look up suddenly. The mail slot flashes green, and the first letter drops down. Watching the letter fall into the mailbox, Grandpa smiles happily.
1:1:55|1:2:3|His eyes reflected the blinking green light of the receiving port, while the letters from the receiving port kept falling continuously, dropping into the letter box.
1:2:3|1:2:11|Grandpa watched as all the letters fell into the mailbox, and the ringing of the bell stopped.
1:2:11|1:2:25|Grandpa trembled as he picked up all the letters in the basket. Sitting at the table, he smiled as he opened the letters one by one. Despite his usually slow movements, Grandpa became much more agile when opening the letters.
1:2:25|1:2:33|Grandpa blew into the envelope and carefully read the contents of the letter through half-frame glasses.
1:2:33|1:2:48|The full moon hangs high in the sky, it seems like a long time has passed. [Xiao Bo] yawns as he walks down the stairs, rubbing his neck as he heads towards the inner room. Through the window, he sees his grandfather still engrossed in reading a letter.
1:3:10|1:3:31|Grandpa continued to open another letter and found a painting inside. He read it excitedly. Grandpa almost put his face close to the letter, and there was a message below the painting. The letter mentioned that it was from Michael Jackson who wrote to Grandpa 25 years ago.
1:4:8|1:4:31|As they were talking, another letter fell into the mailbox. [Xiao Jun] walked over to the mailbox, leaned in to look inside, then looked back at the mailbox in confusion. He came back holding a piece of white paper, and at that moment, the grandfather took a look at the paper.
1:5:14|1:5:29|[Xiao Jun] saw Grandpa burying his head in the letter, so he took his own letter and walked out. He opened the envelope in the car, and the letter contained Grandpa's notes.
1:6:40|1:7:0|Grandpa was still leaning on the table, but the light in front of him gradually dimmed until it merged with the darkness. In the courtyard of Rainbow House, Xiao Bo was holding a paintbrush, concentrating on painting on the wall. The wall was quickly filled with Xiao Bo's imaginative drawings.
1:7:0|1:7:9|The main wall depicts the silhouette of [Qin Lang] holding a guitar, surrounded by countless yellow five-pointed stars painted by Xiao Bo. Time passes by.
1:7:9|1:7:16|Xiao Bo, who is now a young man, is painting in front of the wall. The wall of the Rainbow House records Xiao Bo's transformation.
1:7:16|1:7:41|In the blink of an eye, we arrive at the year 2017 in the exhibition hall. On the walls, there is a portrait made up of many faces, with the exhibition theme "Everyone has a hole in their heart." The atmosphere inside the exhibition hall is lively, with people stopping to take photos in front of the portraits. Foreign friends are holding up wine glasses to admire the artwork, a man with long curly hair is pointing at the painting and discussing with his friends, and a tall and beautiful woman is taking a group photo in front of the painting.
1:9:1|1:9:17|He waved to his foreign friend, took out a cigarette from his pocket and put it in his mouth, then turned back and looked. [Xiao Mo] took out his phone, it was a WeChat message from [Zhang Yi]. He opened the chat box, [Zhang Yi] said.
1:9:17|1:9:30|[Zhang Mo] took the cigarette out of his mouth, put his phone in his pocket, and walked out of the exhibition hall's red carpet at the entrance, where the red carpet turned into the wall of Rainbow House.
1:9:50|1:9:58|[Zhang Mo] walked down the familiar Yimin Street from his childhood, turned into an alley, and used his phone to take a picture of the road sign on the stone wall.
1:10:0|1:10:17|The walls by the roadside were covered in modern graffiti. Xiao Bo walked along, recording the changes in the alley with his phone. He noticed a standalone bar with neon lights that read "Déjà Vu Bar". Xiao Bo walked into the bar and sat by the window, taking off his red scarf and placing it on the table.
1:10:17|1:10:26|Hua Zi came to [Zhang Mo] and asked, while Zhang Mo, who was focused on looking at the decoration of the bar, snapped back to reality and stared at Hua Zi.
1:10:38|1:10:49|[Zhang Mo] ordered a single malt whisky, with many Michael Jackson album covers on the wall, tears welled up in [Zhang Mo]'s eyes.
1:11:10|1:11:38|Hua Zi turned around and brought a long box of albums in front of [Zhang Mo]. [Zhang Mo]'s gaze locked onto the disc. [Zhang Mo] took out several albums, one by one, and looked at them carefully with a smile. As [Zhang Mo] admired his collection, he took out a few more discs and looked at them. Suddenly, he seemed to have turned into stone, as the album in his hand was very familiar to him.
1:11:38|1:11:52|[Zhang Mo] put down the other discs, opened the album in his hand, took out the disc and looked at it, then put it back with two white marks on the front. Hua Zi took the disc box and looked at it.
1:12:32|1:12:48|Hua Zi stood up, followed by [Zhang Mo], and they came to a wall in the bar covered with frames filled with old newspaper clippings. Hua Zi pointed to one of the frames.
1:12:54|1:12:58|[Zhang Mo] leaned in to examine the news in the newspaper on the photo frame carefully.
1:12:58|1:13:4|The title is "A family of three unable to repay high-interest loans, fleeing and meeting a tragic end". Many years ago,
1:13:4|1:13:24|On the winding mountain road, a white sedan is driving. Xiao Bo's mother is crying out to her husband, when suddenly a black jeep comes chasing from behind.
1:13:25|1:13:55|Father also noticed the car, he sped up, the Jeep chased after, on the left side of the BMW, the creditor shouted, father's eyes were terrifying, staring ahead, the black Jeep violently collided with the BMW body, the Jeep forcefully hit the BMW again.
1:14:2|1:14:22|The creditor grabbed the handle and gave the BMW a final blow, causing it to slide close to the hillside. It crashed into a protruding boulder on the hillside, shattering the glass. The mother in the passenger seat was covered in blood. The black jeep hit a piece of broken stone, instantly bursting a tire, causing the steering wheel to malfunction, and it crashed through the guardrail of the ring road and fell into the valley.
1:14:23|1:14:48|In the BMW car, [Qin Lang] father just woke up from the steering wheel, his wife beside him was bleeding profusely with weak breath. The huge rock that the BMW car crashed into was a small protrusion of the mountain, but it ended [Qin Lang] mother's life. The father regretfully held his wife's hand, his eyes closed tightly, his expression pained. He pressed his wife's hand against his forehead, then let go of her hand, swallowing his sobs, trying to calm his emotions.
1:14:48|1:14:54|He pursed his lips and opened the car door, anxiously looking around for the shadow of the black jeep.
1:14:56|1:15:12|The father saw a gap in the guardrail and hurriedly ran over to check. The black jeep was already engulfed in flames at the bottom of the cliff. The father lay on the guardrail, grabbing his hair in agony. He buried his face in his arms, sobbing as he crouched down.
1:15:16|1:15:21|The father leaned against the steering wheel and wrote a farewell letter in a notebook,
1:15:48|1:16:1|[Zhang Mo] rushed out of the bar after watching the news, leaning against the wall and crying uncontrollably. Many years ago, his father finished writing his will, closed the notebook, sighed lightly, tucked the notebook into the compartment of his bag, put the pen in the bag as well, and then closed the clasp.
1:16:3|1:16:30|The white BMW started and drove away from the bridge. At the gap in the bridge railing was [Hao Bo]'s father's wallet. His face was flushed as he drove the battered BMW, the right side of the car already smashed to pieces, with only a faint light from the right headlight. Suddenly stepping on the gas, the car sped wildly on the mountain road. As he approached a bend, the father sharply turned the steering wheel, the car broke through the guardrail, soaring into the sky. The white BMW plummeted in mid-air.
1:16:30|1:16:38|Diving into the deep blue and tranquil sea, the splashes of water from the car gradually settled down after a few seconds. Outside the bar,
1:16:38|1:16:45|[Zhang Mo] clenched his fist tightly, trying hard not to let himself cry out.
1:17:31|1:17:56|[Zhang Mo] stuffed the letter into the mailbox, the envelope falling into the pile of letters inside. The figure of his grandfather loomed over this stack of letters. He took all the letters out of the mailbox, walking with small steps towards the inner room. Passing by the wooden cabinet filled with various goods, he reached the desk in the inner room. On the low table outside the window, there were bottles of similar sizes. He slowly sat down at the desk, supporting his body with his hands.
1:17:56|1:18:13|Grandpa took a deep breath and couldn't wait to open the letter. He picked up the first letter, carefully opened the envelope, and one by one, the wide-mouthed bottles on the cabinet outside the door disappeared, making the room dim and lightless.
1:18:13|1:18:43|This is a grocery store in 2018, with warm candlelight flickering. Beside the counter, [Tong Tong] is playing the guitar while [Xiao Bo] is quietly listening. In the room nearby, [A Jie] is leaning on the leather sofa and falling asleep. On the coffee table next to him are stolen handbags and emptied wallets. Faintly, the sound of [Tong Tong]'s guitar can be heard as [Xiao Bo] lights another candle.
1:18:43|1:18:54|[Tong Tong] sat on the steps, looking at the poster of the dream girl. [Xiao Bo] silently sat opposite her, snatching the poster away.
1:19:14|1:19:23|In the inner room, there suddenly came the sound of weeping. [A Jie] seemed to have a nightmare, shedding tears and mumbling incoherent words.
1:19:38|1:19:47|[A Jie] woke up with tears in his eyes, immediately wiping them away with his sleeve. [Tong Tong] reached out to take the poster and asked for advice from [Xiao Bo].
1:19:52|1:19:58|[Tong Tong] picked up the guitar with a smile, strumming the strings and singing.
1:20:12|1:20:17|[A Jie] angrily stopped the pain, and the bell rang again.
1:20:41|1:20:44|[A Jie] seemed to be touched by a hidden pain, snatching the letter away. Chapter Three.
1:20:59|1:21:17|In the 90s nightclub, Xiao Bo, with heavy makeup, drinks a glass of red wine. A customer hands her a banknote, and she immediately takes a whole bottle of red wine and drinks it all in one go. Xiao Bo shakes the bottle in a showy manner, and the people around applaud and cheer.
1:21:18|1:21:33|Near the grocery store, Qingmei clings to a utility pole and vomits wildly. Not far away, [Qin Lang] holds a letter and looks at her. [Qin Lang] glances back at the grocery store before returning his gaze to Qingmei. The tipsy Qingmei sways forward and, upon seeing [Qin Lang], cautiously asks,
1:21:48|1:22:12|[Qin Lang] left with the letter, Qingmei sneered, then twitched her mouth and smiled. Her eyes rolled around and she saw the nameless grocery store that [Qin Lang] mentioned. The advertisement in front of the store fluttered in the wind. Inside the nightclub, a man in a shirt and sunglasses called the waiter over, and the waiter walked over with a tray.
1:22:19|1:22:35|Carrying the tray to the front of the stage, Xiao Bo said to [Qin Lang], [Qin Lang] bent down to pick up the rose, smiled towards [Mr. Su], and [Mr. Su] waved to her, beckoning her to come to his side.
1:22:56|1:23:18|[Qingmei] and [Mr. Su] clinked glasses, and [Mr. Su] took out a few 100 yuan bills from a stack of money and placed them in front of [Qingmei]. They danced in the dance floor, with [Mr. Su] embracing her and [Qingmei] leaning her head on his shoulder generously, showing great intimacy between the two.
1:23:18|1:23:37|[Xiao Bo] and [Qin Lang] were shopping together. [Xiao Bo] was skeptical about what she heard, while [Qin Lang] squatted down to help her try on shoes.
1:24:7|1:24:12|In the grocery store, [A Jie] angrily crumples up the letter and throws it away.
1:24:47|1:24:55|[Qingmei] opened the milk box and found a letter inside, so she took it out and read it while walking. [Qingmei] then wrote a reply in the dressing room.
1:25:16|1:25:23|In the Rainbow House, [Qingmei] is hanging out clothes with the little girl, Xiao Bo.
1:27:51|1:28:5|Mr. Li's assistant tried to run when he saw the police, but was quickly pushed back to his seat by the police. Mr. Li took a drag on his cigarette and looked at the police on both sides, saying,
1:28:43|1:28:51|In the grocery store, [A Jie] woke himself up from a nap. He was sitting next to the mailbox, leaned in to take a closer look, and let out a long sigh.
1:28:51|1:29:7|[A Jie] turned his head to look at the two behind him, just as a letter fell out of the mail slot. [A Jie] quickly tore open the envelope.
1:29:46|1:29:58|[A Jie] took the pen and wrote. [Qin Lang] opened the milk carton again, eagerly taking the letter.
1:31:3|1:31:15|The three of them lay side by side on the table, [A Jie] and [Tong Tong] exchanged a smile, while [Xiao Bo] seemed to have figured something out. He turned around, picked up the letter, and examined it carefully.
1:31:38|1:31:58|Xiao Bo raised his hand and stuffed the white paper into the letterbox at the front door, while Tong Tong suddenly looked up at the sky.
1:32:0|1:32:19|[A Jie] said regretfully, [Tong Tong] lowered her eyes. [A Jie] slowly walked back into the inner room and slumped on the sofa. [Tong Tong] picked up the guitar and leaned against the door frame.
1:32:21|1:32:47|[A Jie] then asked, looking at [Xiao Bo] beside him, who had no suggestions either. [A Jie] took out a coin from his pocket and tossed it into the air. As he slapped the coin back onto his hand, it rolled to the ground with a clatter. Bending down to search for it, [A Jie] suddenly noticed a letter underneath the bag on the coffee table. He picked up the letter and walked towards the other two.
1:32:52|1:32:56|The three of them gathered together, and [A Jie] quickly tore open the envelope and unfolded the letter.
1:35:23|1:35:28|Qingmei from Rainbow House opened the door and got out of the car wearing sunglasses.
1:35:34|1:35:44|The bodyguard stopped a group of reporters from following, Qingmei and her assistant walked into the courtyard, [Xiao Bo] on the second floor balcony looked at her through the stone railing, [Xiao Bo]'s gaze closely followed Qingmei, but his eyes were filled with resentment.
1:35:44|1:35:47|Qingmei walked into the room, took off her sunglasses, and greeted with a smile.
1:36:15|1:36:28|Miss Zhang took out several old red lacquer wooden boxes. Miss Zhang handed a pocket watch to Qingmei, and then took out a letter. On the envelope, it was written "Rainbow, please open". Inside the envelope was a black and white photo of a man and a woman.
1:37:34|1:37:55|Qingmei saw the comforting notice on the computer in the Tieba, in front of the corridor's photo wall, Qingmei looked at the years of memories recorded along the way to Rainbow House. One photo caught her eye, it was a group photo of [A Jie], [Tong Tong], and [Xiao Bo].
1:37:55|1:38:0|Her gaze shifted back to the photo wall, leaning in to look at [Mrs. Zhang]'s photo.
1:39:38|1:39:47|[A Jie] leaned weakly against the stone railing,
1:40:10|1:40:18|Xiao Bo's pupils trembled, looking at A Jie in disbelief. The three of them arrived at Qingmei's villa at night and even taped up Qingmei.
1:40:22|1:40:31|Xiao Bo, Tong Tong, and Qin Lang sat on the steps, reminiscing about last night.
1:40:43|1:41:1|[Tong Tong] looked up at the sky, urged by [A Jie]. She put the notebook and cosmetics on the table back into Qingmei's bag. [Xiao Bo] was sorting out the mail at the counter, while [A Jie] sat blankly on the steps. [Tong Tong] walked out from the inner room and placed Qingmei's bag on the table.
1:41:1|1:41:10|Leaning against the table, [A Jie] looks towards [A Jie], who seems to be regretting something. [Tong Tong] takes out a poster of the dream girl from the pocket of her denim jacket.
1:41:10|1:41:31|Taking a closer look, then handing the poster to [A Jie], who reached out to take it. [Xiao Bo] put all the letters back into the envelope, [A Jie] smiled and asked [Tong Tong]. [Tong Tong] shyly nodded, and the two of them smiled at each other.
1:41:31|1:41:44|[A Jie] saw Xiao Bo sorting out the letters with a frown and asked. Xiao Bo slowly raised his head to look at the wall with empty eyes. A Jie waited quietly for his answer. Xiao Bo took a deep breath and turned to A Jie.
1:41:53|1:42:25|[A Jie] and [Tong Tong] smiled knowingly, the back door of the grocery store opened, and the three of them walked out from the house. [A Jie] squinted in the sunlight outside, [Xiao Bo] closed the wooden door and pulled the last latch. [A Jie] opened the milk box again and was surprised to find a reply letter inside. [Xiao Bo] quickly approached and read aloud, the three of them sat together in a circle reading the letter.
