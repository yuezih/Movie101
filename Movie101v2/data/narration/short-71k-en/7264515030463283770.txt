0:0:34|0:0:41|The film begins with people orderly checking tickets and entering the circus venue, with a constant stream of audience members coming and going, creating a lively atmosphere.
0:0:43|0:0:50|After the audience took their seats, Changfu Circus started the show with a lively welcome ceremony, as two large flags were unfurled to kick off the performance.
0:0:50|0:1:0|Following that, two lion dance lions came to the center of the stage, with the heads, limbs, and bodies of the two lions moving agilely, galloping powerfully, and leaping lightly.
0:1:0|0:1:7|On the side of the stage, several people are performing somersaults, with a set of movements that flow like water, very beautiful.
0:1:7|0:1:14|Later, the Ancient Horn Team entered the stage, walking and blowing their horns, encircling the stage once.
0:1:14|0:1:19|They were followed by four children who performed a Diabolo acrobatics routine for everyone.
0:1:19|0:1:27|The acrobat at the bottom effortlessly lifts the three people and circles the field, very impressive. The atmosphere in the venue is cheerful, and the whole warm-up event is very lively.
0:1:28|0:1:33|Behind the scenes, [Han] lifts the curtain and walks out of the dressing room, looking around as if searching for someone.
0:1:51|0:1:59|After [Xiao Ding] left, his father [Master Shen] also put his hat back on, and the serious expression on his face was replaced with a smile.
0:1:59|0:2:13|After that, the aerial rope act began, with [Chiang Yitien] appearing energetically from backstage and taking the lead by grabbing the rope. The other two quickly followed suit, and the three of them swiftly performed somersaults in the air, moving at a speed resembling that of rolling tires in motion.
0:2:14|0:2:24|They then began to do the splits, with their legs constantly changing positions between the ropes, performing a dazzling array of movements comparable to today's gymnasts on the rings.
0:2:24|0:2:28|The more the rope wrapped around their wrists, the further they were lifted off the ground.
0:2:28|0:2:34|At this moment, [Chiang Yitien] suddenly let the rope out, and the audience below thought he was going to fall, all of them gasping in shock.
0:2:47|0:2:52|In the backstage, [Han] in clown makeup, secretly slipped some money to [Xiao Mei].
0:2:52|0:2:56|At that moment, [Xiao Ding] on the stage was performing aerial acrobatics with his partner.
0:2:56|0:3:0|The partner held the swing frame with his left hand and pulled [Xiao Ding] with his right hand.
0:3:0|0:3:5|[Xiao Ding] performs high-difficulty moves such as somersaults, one-handed handstands, and hanging hooks while spinning in the air.
0:3:6|0:3:9|The performance is both brilliant and dreamlike.
0:3:9|0:3:13|The audience was moved by this wonderful performance, and applause thundered for a moment.
0:3:13|0:3:17|The performance at the racecourse is also in full swing.
0:3:17|0:3:22|Two actors are performing acrobatics on horseback, with [Xiao Ding] in the middle of the stage holding a whip to drive the horse.
0:3:22|0:3:26|At this moment, the actress with a high ponytail, [Xiao Ding], rushes in from outside wanting to mount the horse.
0:3:26|0:3:31|Neither of them paid any attention to her. Annoyed, she pushed them aside and angrily swung her arms.
0:3:34|0:3:40|While resting on the bed, [Han] walked out of the field, wiped the sweat with his hand, and fidgeted with his clothes to let air in.
0:3:40|0:3:47|He walked over to the tent and sat down, his lover [Xiao Mei] looking at him helplessly.
0:3:58|0:3:59|[Xiao Ding] put down the makeup brush in her hand and walked towards the door.
0:4:22|0:4:27|[Xiao Ding] took the clown nose from [Ding Mei]'s hand and turned back to the field.
0:4:27|0:4:31|She walked to the center of the stage with a comical stride, choosing the item she wanted.
0:4:31|0:4:36|She squeezed through the iron wires to come to the swing performance area, pretending to be hit by the swing on purpose.
0:4:36|0:4:39|Han's performance made the audience burst into horrified laughter.
0:4:39|0:4:44|She then grabbed the swing board, curled up on it, and swung back and forth.
0:4:44|0:4:49|Next second, she flipped onto the board, performing a 360-degree rotation with the swing.
0:4:51|0:5:4|The swing kept spinning in the air, and as it descended on its final loop, Han was thrown out by the person behind him. He thought he would fall to the ground, but he was caught by the person performing an inverted hang on the other side. The three of them experienced a sweaty fall in the air.
0:5:5|0:5:11|The series of performances were so exciting that the audience clearly wanted more.
0:5:11|0:5:21|Following is a children's acrobatics performance, with [Xiao Lan] balancing five bamboo stands on her hands, feet, and forehead, while three other [Xiao Lan] are seen inside a round tube.
0:5:21|0:5:34|As the performance progresses, [Xiao Lan] is responsible for flipping over the bamboo platform and bending down, while the other three [children], two of them back-to-back, crawl into a cylinder and take turns lifting each other up. The third one stands and bends their leg over their head.
0:5:36|0:5:47|Following is the bamboo pole performance. Six men, divided into three groups, balance on two poles. Their movements are synchronized, as if copied and pasted, even the youngest man can complete it smoothly.
0:5:49|0:5:58|The audience cheered continuously, then everyone stepped back, leaving [Chiang Yitien] alone to climb the pole. With just the strength of his arms, he climbed to the very top using only his hands.
0:5:58|0:6:8|Later, he leaped onto another pole, and he was seen jumping back and forth between the two poles. Finally, he went head down, slid down the pole, and took a bow with his companions to thank the audience.
0:6:10|0:6:23|[Xiao Ding] played a child with a blank expression. After everyone stepped back, he walked onto the stage in a daze, looking around, and then made a big leap forward.
0:6:45|0:6:53|[Chiang Yitien] is fighting two opponents alone, moving agilely and landing punches accurately, catching the opponents off guard.
0:7:19|0:7:25|After [Shen Tinyi] returned the money, he gave [Chiang Yitien] a glare and then left coldly.
0:7:25|0:7:31|In the afternoon, [Shen Tinyi] and [Xiao Ding] returned to the stage again, performing the magic flying knives.
0:7:31|0:7:35|[Xiao Ding] fastened himself to the disc, and [Shen Tinyi] started to spin it.
0:7:35|0:7:43|[Shen Tinyi] stood in the distance, throwing throwing knives at the target. The knives seemed to have eyes as they perfectly dodged [Xiao Ding].
0:7:43|0:7:45|The audience was very nervous, holding their breath.
0:7:46|0:7:57|After seeing that the person didn't shoot, the audience erupted into thunderous applause.
0:7:57|0:8:1|After the three of them finished performing, [Han] immediately dealt with the matter in another place.
0:8:22|0:8:27|[Shen Tinyi] is putting on the costume of a skydiver in front of the mirror, and [Xiao Ding] walks in quickly to persuade him.
0:8:40|0:8:44|However, [Shen Tinyi] was still somewhat worried.
0:8:44|0:8:47|The aerialist has gone through ups and downs, and finally begins.
0:8:47|0:8:51|[Chiang Yitien] appeared on stage in a cloak, shining as he lifted the curtain.
0:8:51|0:8:55|The audience has been eagerly anticipating it, and the scene is filled with cheers and laughter.
0:8:55|0:8:57|He is calm and composed, not at all flustered.
0:8:57|0:9:1|[Chiang Yitien] stands up and excitedly spreads his arms to salute the audience.
0:9:1|0:9:4|Afterwards, he grabbed the horizontal bar and pushed forward with all his strength.
0:9:5|0:9:9|Suddenly, a shell dropped from the sky and exploded in front of him.
0:9:9|0:9:14|Yitien fell from the horizontal bar, but luckily he reacted quickly and caught the safety rope in time.
0:9:14|0:9:19|But the bomber continued to drop bombs, and the circus instantly turned into a sea of fire.
0:9:20|0:9:29|The audience fled the circus in a panic, those who couldn't escape were blown away by the shells, turning what should have been a place filled with laughter into one filled with screams.
0:9:29|0:9:38|The circus instantly turned into a sea of fire, with mushroom clouds rising above. [Master Shen] protected his daughter and apprentice as they ran out of the circus.
0:10:11|0:10:13|Everyone split the money and went their separate ways.
0:10:46|0:10:52|Yitien glanced at Chiang Yitien, turned away without wanting to take the money, but Chiang Yitien still stuffed the money into his pocket.
0:11:28|0:11:32|After bidding farewell to everyone, Han left without hesitation.
0:11:32|0:11:37|The roar of war echoed through the sky as the Japanese occupied the three provinces in the east, establishing the puppet state of Manchukuo.
0:11:37|0:11:41|They are looting and pillaging across China, causing great distress.
0:11:41|0:11:47|The scene shifts to the dock, where the crowd is bustling and everyone is trying to find a way to escape from here.
0:11:47|0:11:55|Master Shen's family is also here. He walks in the middle protecting Xiao Ding, Captain Ding, Yitien, and Xiao Mei leading the way.
0:11:55|0:11:57|Five people were being pushed forward by the crowd, making it very difficult for them to move.
0:12:34|0:12:39|Soon, [Han] led everyone to the side of the ship and pointed to the window, saying.
0:12:41|0:12:52|One day, [Han] took the lead, rolling up the hem of his robe and securing it to the belt around his waist. Then he stepped onto the fixed rope of the boat, using tightrope walking skills to slowly make his way to the deck.
0:12:52|0:12:59|At the same time, Han, Xiao Lan, and Xiao Mei, three children from the south, west, and north, rolled over a wooden barrel, picked up a plank, and made a simple springboard.
0:12:59|0:13:11|At this moment, the sailors were watching the crowd boarding the ship ahead, so [Master Shen] was temporarily safe on this side. [Yitien] walked cautiously step by step and finally safely boarded the ship, then hurriedly caught the luggage thrown up by [Yixi].
0:13:11|0:13:17|Following that, [Xiao Lan] lifted [Xiao Mei] up, and with a strong jump, [Xiao Mei] propelled [Han] onto the boat.
0:13:17|0:13:23|Following this method, soon, all three children successfully boarded the ship.
0:13:23|0:13:25|Big sister [Ding Mei] used the same method.
0:13:27|0:13:30|Next up is [Master Shen].
0:13:30|0:13:37|One day a rope was thrown down from the ship, and [Master Shen] pulled on the rope, climbing up to the deck as if rock climbing.
0:13:37|0:13:38|Ding Ju followed closely behind.
0:13:42|0:13:48|[Ding Lan] was about to go up, but was stopped by the arriving sailor. Just as he was about to be taken away, [Chiang Yitien] arrived.
0:13:56|0:14:10|Chiang Yitien raised his sword and took a step, holding a bamboo pole with both hands. Xiao Lan stepped on his leg and climbed up the pole. When she reached a certain height, Chiang Yitien tilted the pole towards the boat. Xiao Lan flipped and leaped onto the boat. Once she stood firm, she quickly signaled to Chiang Yitien.
0:14:10|0:14:24|[Chiang Yitien] dropped the bamboo pole, extended two spring ropes from his sleeves, and fixed them on the railing with a flick. He then exerted force to pivot, causing the ropes to naturally retract forward. [Chiang Yitien] was pulled onto the boat, retracted the ropes, and joyfully reunited with everyone.
0:14:32|0:14:49|Master Shen looked helplessly at Chiang Yitien, who lowered his head guiltily and dared not meet the master's gaze. The sound of the whistle rang out as the boat slowly started moving.
0:14:49|0:14:52|[Chiang Yitien] carefully supports [Xiao Lan] and helps him carry the luggage.
0:15:4|0:15:11|[Chiang Yitien] dropped his luggage and charged forward like a released arrow, with [Xiao Lan] closely following behind.
0:15:11|0:15:21|But before [Chiang Yitien] could arrive, Captain Tang flew out of the tent and kicked the thief in the face, causing the thief to fall straight back.
0:15:25|0:15:38|The thief took the opportunity to escape quickly, [Captain Tang] hurriedly stood up to chase, accidentally bumping into [Xiao Lan] who came over. [Xiao Lan] was captivated by his handsome face, and [Captain Tang] also turned back to take another look at him.
0:15:38|0:15:43|On the other side, [Chiang Yitien] took a shortcut and caught up with the thief, diving onto the thief's neck.
0:15:48|0:15:55|[Chiang Yitien] is writhing in pain on the ground, holding his wound. At this moment, [Captain Tang] arrives and kicks the thief down.
0:15:55|0:16:7|Captain Tang ordered his men to beat the thief severely, and Chiang Yitien quickly got up to stop them.
0:16:7|0:16:11|Captain Tang ignored him and, coincidentally, the police arrived and shot the thief dead.
0:16:11|0:16:17|[Chiang Yitien] cowered in fear behind a tree, as his henchman pulled out a bag of stolen goods from a thief's pocket and handed it to [Captain Tang].
0:18:8|0:18:10|Ma Li walked out of the warehouse and asked.
0:19:5|0:19:9|[Chiang Yitien] was kicked by Mary and, feeling aggrieved, turned around and started fighting with him.
0:19:9|0:19:13|Mary showed no fear of him, and for a moment, the two were evenly matched.
0:19:13|0:19:16|[Chiang Yitien] was about to make the next move when an old man suddenly shouted.
0:20:29|0:20:32|Master Shen and his team found a dilapidated house and were working on repairing it.
0:20:57|0:21:2|[Xiao Ding] sat aside, not wanting to pay attention all day.
0:21:2|0:21:9|This is [Captain Tang] returning, he gives [Captain Tang] instructions again.
0:21:26|0:21:27|After speaking, [Chiang Yitien] quickly flipped onto the roof to help with the repairs.
0:22:46|0:22:49|[Chiang Yitien] heard his master calling him, and instantly became at a loss.
0:22:49|0:22:53|He turned back slowly and saw his master shaking his head at him.
0:22:53|0:22:58|The scene cuts to the street, where Han, Xiao Lan, and three young disciples are huddled together whispering.
0:23:48|0:23:52|The children, however, showed little interest in the program and dispersed one after another.
0:23:52|0:23:58|[Chiang Yitien] was ready to perform, but turned around to find no one there.
0:24:0|0:24:15|[Ding Lan] on the other hand, the situation is quite the opposite, their handsome martial arts skills and exciting acrobatic performances attract a lot of onlookers.
0:24:15|0:24:25|After that, Captain Tang and Xiao Lan performed their tricks one after another. The youngest Xiao Lan went around with a bowl asking for money, and everyone was generous, giving her a lot.
0:24:30|0:24:37|One day, [Chiang Yitien] squeezed into the crowd, only to see [Han] and his three young disciples performing their martial arts routines with precision and agility.
0:24:37|0:24:43|[Ding Lan]'s acrobatic performance is very thrilling, and the audience is kept entertained with continuous applause and cheers.
0:24:43|0:24:46|[Ding Ju] saw the two of them exchange a glance, looking proud.
0:24:46|0:24:50|The two smiled at each other and then joined the audience in applauding.
0:24:50|0:24:56|Suddenly, someone maliciously threw a string of firecrackers into the crowd, causing the acrobatic little girl [Ding Lan] was holding to be frightened and fall down.
0:25:29|0:25:33|After seeing Xiao Lan and Xiao Ju leave, Han turned to Shen Tinyi and said.
0:25:35|0:25:38|[Shen Tinyi] shook his head and stepped back.
0:25:38|0:25:46|Han throws the money in his hand up and knocks them down one by one while his brother is not paying attention.
0:25:46|0:25:48|[Shen Tinyi] caught the money in his pocket.
0:26:4|0:26:10|The sound of fighting attracted [Captain Tang], causing Lipi to panic and flee upon seeing him, while Lidong continued to beat them up without knowing.
0:27:30|0:27:44|Captain Tang walked up to Xiao Lan and looked at her. Xiao Lan turned around and saw him too. Their eyes briefly met and quickly separated. Captain Tang didn't leave until Xiao Lan was out of sight, then the camera moved to a boat.
0:29:17|0:29:18|Master Shen sighed and walked away, while [Xiao Lan] worriedly confided in Yitien.
0:29:50|0:30:8|In order to earn more money to reorganize the circus, Han came to the recruitment factory. He squatted by the factory wall waiting for work, his mind couldn't help but recall his performance as the "Aerialist" that was abruptly ended by gunfire. With a face full of bitterness, he sighed wistfully, longing to return to the circus and continue his acrobatic dreams.
0:30:8|0:30:19|The voice from the side interrupted his reminiscence. Before he knew it, a crowd had gathered at the door. Li Dong quickly stood up, looking puzzled at everyone. It turned out that the workers from the factory had come out.
0:30:20|0:30:33|They looked at the poster of today's zero achievements on the wall, the crowd dispersed, Yitien stepped forward to carefully examine the poster, sighed in frustration, was about to leave with his hands in his pockets when he was stopped by a man in a yellow carriage.
0:31:19|0:31:34|Yitien surveyed the surroundings and finally chose a large tree right next to the police station window. With agile movements, he climbed up the tree trunk. Despite it being a towering tree, he quickly reached the top and then made a turn, jumping safely onto the window ledge.
0:31:34|0:31:40|[Lung] saw that he had arrived, immediately showing a triumphant smile, while Yitien foolishly ran to the other side to greet them.
0:31:42|0:31:55|[Lung] and his men climbed onto the windowsill, sneaking into the interior of the police station. [Lung] took the lead and approached a door, looking inside before turning to Yitien and saying.
0:31:55|0:32:11|Han and the others arrived at the detention room, Han knocked on the door, and the person inside rushed over upon hearing the sound. Han turned around and pressed him against the wall. Lung reminded him, Han took the key and rushed inside, only to find out.
0:32:17|0:32:27|Yitien opens the door next to him, where a group of police officers are playing cards.
0:32:27|0:32:33|Lung Wu and his men have hurriedly taken people to escape, [Chiang Yitien] is surrounded and blocked by a group of police, with no way out.
0:32:33|0:32:40|Unable to do anything else, he started fighting with the police. Captain Tang couldn't catch up, so he went downstairs to block Chiang Yitien and glanced at him to make a judgment.
0:32:55|0:33:6|[Chiang Yitien] ran away while anxiously explaining, but [Captain Tang] didn't want to talk to him. They fought their way down the stairs from the first floor, evenly matched and unable to determine a winner for the time being.
0:33:6|0:33:13|At this moment, [Chiang Yitien] grabbed the handrail of the stairs on the second floor, trying to escape. [Captain Tang] reacted quickly and immediately caught up.
0:33:13|0:33:19|Just as [Chiang Yitien] thought he was about to succeed, two guns were pointed at his chest, and [Captain Tang] nodded.
0:33:24|0:33:28|Soon, [Shen Tinyi] and [Xiao Ding] were called to the police station.
0:34:4|0:34:13|[Shen Tinyi] immediately accompanied Xiao to sign, while at this moment, three children, one from the south, one from the west, and one from the north, holding hands wanting to board the flower boat to play, were stopped by the guards.
0:34:32|0:34:37|Three children are getting ready to board the ship, and [Xiao Ding] also arrives here, looking around as if searching for something.
0:34:37|0:34:40|At this moment, Captain Tang patted him on the back.
0:34:51|0:34:53|Speak up, [Han] is looking for trouble again.
0:34:53|0:35:10|At this moment, the innkeeper spotted the three of them and shouted loudly.
0:35:10|0:35:13|Xiao Lan provides cover for them.
0:35:13|0:35:15|Captain Tang immediately flipped off the bridge to chase after hearing this.
0:35:21|0:35:26|Captain Tang mentioned righteousness and shook it, and the righteous man came back to try to save righteousness.
0:35:26|0:35:28|Captain Tang caught up with Yitien, who was running at the back.
0:36:13|0:36:14|[Ding Lan] punished three people to do a headstand.
0:36:50|0:36:59|Master Shen's family started eating, and Master Shen kept coughing at the dining table.
0:36:59|0:37:2|Xiao Mei still looked worried as Han handed a teacup to the master.
0:38:15|0:38:19|Master Shen finished speaking and then led one person from the south and one person from the north onto the ship.
0:38:19|0:38:23|The crew on the ship saw them and asked.
0:38:29|0:38:37|Master Shen nodded to the assistant in gratitude. He led three children into the cabin, and the assistant shouted inside, "Boss, someone is looking for you. Please come in."
0:38:40|0:38:49|Master Shen continued to walk inside, and [Madame Boss] came out to open the door. When she saw Master Shen, her eyes widened, and when Master Shen saw her, his smile froze on his face.
0:38:49|0:38:57|Originally, these two were partners of the Magic Flying Knives. They were senior brothers in the circus, knew each other very early, and could be considered old acquaintances.
0:38:57|0:38:59|[The landlady] smiled faintly and spoke first.
0:40:9|0:40:11|Bouncing around all day, very mischievous.
0:40:56|0:41:1|[The landlady] finished speaking and walked towards the door, while Master Shen's family's gaze remained fixed on her.
0:41:1|0:41:7|Master Shen quickly regained his composure and spoke to the children.
0:41:7|0:41:10|Immediately, he showed a somewhat embarrassed expression.
0:41:13|0:41:17|[Xiao Ding] and Chiang Yitien look mischievous.
0:43:13|0:43:16|[The landlady] arranged for Master Shen's family to move into a large house.
0:43:16|0:43:21|At this moment, [Chiang Yitien] looked at the landlady going upstairs and sighed.
0:43:27|0:43:31|[Xiao Lan] looked at the back of [Chiang Yitien] with an unclear expression, thinking about something.
0:43:57|0:43:59|[Shen Tinyi] put the wooden pillow back on the bed.
0:44:27|0:44:29|The scene shifts to the office of Zhang's factory.
0:45:59|0:46:6|With the help of the landlady, the master and his two apprentices finally found a job. They walked out of the factory manager's office in high spirits, ready to start working.
0:46:6|0:46:13|Although the work was not easy, they always had smiles on their faces, without complaining about the unfairness of life, but instead feeling grateful.
0:46:13|0:46:15|One day, the master who was cutting something was a little worried.
0:46:23|0:46:39|Suddenly, a group of police officers burst in and shouted inside.
0:46:39|0:46:43|Everyone stopped what they were doing and gathered around, looking down with concern.
0:47:6|0:47:17|Several workers got into a fight with the police out of anger, and ended up being beaten up. They were lying on the side when [Shen Tinyi] helped them up and stood up to argue with a sense of justice.
0:47:17|0:47:25|Captain Tang, standing on the side, gestured with his hand for them not to show themselves.
0:47:25|0:47:29|[Master Shen] and his group looked at the police indignantly, saying that this was a matter of principle.
0:47:37|0:47:44|[Master Shen], [Xiao Lan], and [Captain Tang] looked at each other helplessly upon hearing this, while three children were playing on the street at that moment.
0:48:1|0:48:5|Once again out of work, [Master Shen] looked worried and hesitant, keeping to himself and not daring to approach.
0:49:31|0:49:37|The next day the factory resumed operation, with someone dressed as a foreman ringing a bell and addressing everyone.
0:50:22|0:50:27|A familiar voice reached Yi Dong's ears, and he turned to look, only to see [Lung].
0:50:27|0:50:31|He slammed down his bowl and chopsticks, looking resentful.
0:50:31|0:50:35|Master Shen and Yitien were clueless about what had happened, looking at him in confusion.
0:50:38|0:50:44|[Lung] and Uncle Seven were chatting and laughing in the courtyard, but the sound was extremely grating to Yitien.
0:50:44|0:50:48|He kept stuffing food into his mouth, afraid that his master would worry, until he couldn't fit any more in.
0:51:8|0:51:14|Master Shen took Yitien to settle accounts at the factory. Yitien kicked open the door of the factory director's office and rushed in.
0:51:46|0:51:53|After a round of persuasion, [Lung] couldn't bear the pressure and was about to be taken to the police station by Yitien, when he suddenly saw someone approaching the door, his eyes lit up.
0:52:0|0:52:12|[Lung] Wu saw the savior and immediately perked up. He exerted himself to open a door and hid behind [Lung] Wei.
0:52:18|0:52:22|Master Shen angrily walked out of the scene in his apron, and [Xiao Ding] quickly followed after him.
0:52:34|0:52:38|[Xiao Ding] sent Yitien and the others out with a worried look on his face, while Master Shen coughed violently in the night.
0:54:37|0:54:43|The landlady left with a happy face, just as Captain Tang was feeling pleased, Lung suddenly appeared.
0:55:5|0:55:13|Captain Ding hurried back to see what they were up to when he heard the words.
0:55:13|0:55:17|He ran to Master Shen's room with his junior martial siblings.
0:55:17|0:55:21|He blew out the candle, made sure Master Shen was already asleep, and excitedly said to Han and Lung.
0:55:29|0:55:39|Just as the arrangements were made, [Lung] and his group began knocking on the door. A rubber band was placed on the door by one person from the south and one from the west. The door was instantly knocked open by [Lung], and he fell backwards in a somersault.
0:55:41|0:55:46|The two of them burst into laughter at his awkward appearance, when suddenly, his henchman cut the rubber rope and rushed in.
0:55:46|0:55:55|Han and Xiao Lan hurriedly climbed the stairs to prepare for the next trap.
0:55:55|0:56:1|The person who was not knocked down continued to charge forward, [Lung] came alone to a house, where [Chiang Yitien] had already been lying in ambush under the bed.
0:56:1|0:56:5|He used a rope to tie up Lung's feet, causing him to fall to the ground instantly.
0:56:5|0:56:8|Han kicked him in anger and ran out laughing.
0:56:10|0:56:13|[Ding Ju] and [Yi Bei] are setting up another mechanism in the room.
0:56:13|0:56:23|At this moment, a group of people chased after Han relentlessly. Han climbed onto the horizontal bar and, using the swinging momentum, fiercely kicked several people in the chest.
0:56:23|0:56:25|Several people were not convinced, and as a result, they were beaten up again.
0:56:33|0:56:44|[Yitien] climbed up the stone railing of the balcony, [Lung] tried to grab him, but [Yitien] dodged with a leap. He then grabbed the hanging cloth rope, wrapped it around his arm, and swung down to kick [Lung] in the face hard.
0:56:44|0:56:47|Lung tried to get up and chase, but Chiang Yitien had long disappeared.
0:56:49|0:56:56|Han is not done yet, as he gracefully jumps between the bamboo poles, while his men clumsily try to catch up below.
0:56:56|0:57:2|They couldn't catch Yitien, so they angrily chopped down the bamboo pole until Yitien leaped to the other side gracefully and taunted them.
0:57:9|0:57:19|The group of people, unwilling to give up, continued to pursue, unaware that a trap set by the surveillance team was waiting for them.
0:57:19|0:57:30|[Shen Tinyi] emerged from the black curtain, attacking them with punches and kicks from the south, west, and north. After the attack, he walked back into the curtain, leaving the others stunned in place, unsure of who had just beaten them.
0:57:39|0:57:57|[Xiao Ding] and the others surrounded [Lung Wu] in the middle, with the rocket launcher ignited. Sparks exploded at their feet, and they dodged the sparks like a tap dance. When they couldn't hold on any longer and wanted to escape, [Xiao Ding] didn't want to let this group off so easily. He led everyone to drill out of the cylinder and block their way. [Lung Wu] was tormented by them.
0:57:57|0:57:59|Lung lies on the ground and can't get up.
0:58:8|0:58:13|[Xiao Ding] stuffs them all into the rocket barrel, with a wicked smile on his face, ready to light the fuse.
1:0:4|1:0:11|Yitien heard the words of his master, feeling even more guilty. For a moment, he stood still, unsure whether to leave or stay.
1:0:11|1:0:16|He looked at [Ding Lan], and memories of their days rehearsing circus acts together flooded his mind.
1:0:16|1:0:20|At that time, he was so spirited, and his cooperation with [Xiao Lan] was so tacit.
1:0:21|1:0:25|Currently, she has not yet completed a formal aerial acrobatics performance.
1:0:25|1:0:29|She didn't want to give up, [Chiang Yitien] decided to stay and reorganize the circus together.
1:0:29|1:0:33|She put down her luggage and dispelled the thought of leaving.
1:0:33|1:0:36|In the room, [Xiao Mei] sat on the bed with a worried look on her face.
1:1:34|1:1:41|[Xiao Ding] covered himself with a blanket, sighed helplessly, and the scene shifted to the factory.
1:2:14|1:2:18|Despite this, [Chiang Yitien] began the experiment without hesitation.
1:2:18|1:2:26|He lit a cigarette with the candlestick on the table, exhaled a puff of smoke, and his face began to contort, but [Chiang Yitien] still swallowed that breath.
1:2:26|1:2:29|The next morning, [Han] said to [Chiang Yitien].
1:2:53|1:2:58|A luxury car drove into the recruitment factory, and the workers opened the door for them, nodding and bowing in question.
1:3:2|1:3:8|Just as the gate was about to close, [Xiao Ding] rushed over.
1:3:8|1:3:10|He entered the gate and started the experiment again.
1:3:10|1:3:16|Smoke fills the laboratory, and at this moment, a person coughs violently. [Han] quickly orders his subordinates.
1:3:21|1:3:29|[Xiao Mei] continued to persevere with a pained expression, but her hard work finally paid off as she bought the dressing table that [Xiao Ding] had been dreaming of.
1:3:29|1:3:33|She moved forward with the dressing table on her back, looking very happy and pleased.
1:3:46|1:3:48|After speaking, [Xiao Mei] turned around.
1:3:48|1:3:50|At this moment, [Han] walked over and handed her a letter.
1:3:56|1:4:1|[Xiao Mei] caught it with her mouth and then carried the dressing table into the room.
1:4:1|1:4:6|She arranged the dressing table neatly and carefully wiped the mirror.
1:4:6|1:4:9|After finishing her work, [Xiao Mei] sat down and opened the letter to read.
1:4:17|1:4:20|[Xiao Mei] looked panicked, tears welling up in her eyes.
1:4:20|1:4:26|Here, [Han] leads everyone to the street to look for [Xiao Mei], they walk aimlessly while looking around.
1:4:26|1:4:30|At this moment, [Xiao Ding] stopped in his tracks, lost in thought.
1:4:41|1:4:45|[Xiao Ding] left alone after giving instructions.
1:4:47|1:4:57|[Xiao Ding] wanted to go to the police station to ask for help from [Captain Tang]. When he arrived at the entrance, the passing police officers slowed his steps, but he mustered up the courage to walk through the gate in the end.
1:5:42|1:5:45|After speaking, Captain Tang hurried off to make arrangements.
1:5:45|1:5:49|Meanwhile, [Chiang Yitien] walked alone on the street, hands in pockets, with a worried expression on his face.
1:5:49|1:5:55|While crossing the factory, they happened to see a person covered in white cloth being pushed out, with the person pushing the cart complaining as they walked.
1:6:3|1:6:7|[Chiang Yitien] felt something was wrong and wanted to investigate, but the door was locked.
1:6:7|1:6:9|He glanced at the wall and decisively flipped over it.
1:6:9|1:6:14|After entering the gate, he climbed into the factory through the passage used for transporting goods.
1:6:14|1:6:18|He carefully observed the surroundings first to ensure safety before climbing down.
1:6:18|1:6:24|He then lifted a bag onto his head and pretended to be a worker here, quietly walking inside.
1:6:28|1:6:41|After entering a room and hiding behind the door, [Chiang Yitien] came out and opened the boxes stacked here. Inside, various types of firearms were neatly arranged, while another box was filled with grenades.
1:6:41|1:6:47|[Chiang Yitien] was shocked and felt that there must be other secrets in this factory, so he quickly closed the box and walked out.
1:6:49|1:7:3|Next, [Chiang Yitien] entered a room divided into compartments. He gently pushed the door open a crack and through the opening, he saw a foreigner conducting an experiment with a flask filled with an unknown liquid, which looked very eerie.
1:7:3|1:7:5|[Chiang Yitien] closes the door and continues walking inside.
1:7:6|1:7:10|There is a hidden door in this room, [Chiang Yitien] wanted to investigate, but someone walked in.
1:7:10|1:7:14|[Chiang Yitien] pretended to be casual and greeted him, but he was still caught in the act.
1:7:20|1:7:34|Suddenly, the people around wielded knives and axes towards [Chiang Yitien], who was surrounded by them. I was in charge, and for a moment the situation was quite passive. At this moment, he saw a hoist above his head used for transporting things, and he became suspicious.
1:7:34|1:7:40|He first swept through, clearing the surrounding enemies, then made a strong leap, grabbing onto the crane and lying on top of it.
1:7:44|1:7:49|Yitien is too fast, the people below haven't reacted yet.
1:7:49|1:7:56|The group of people rushed towards the crane rope frantically, causing the crane that was moving forward to be completely immobilized.
1:7:56|1:8:1|Yitien jumps onto a large shelf again and successfully escapes by pulling the rope he came with.
1:8:1|1:8:6|At this moment, Captain Tang joyfully called Xiao Ding to the prosecutor's office.
1:8:26|1:8:29|Han is searching for the boss lady's heirloom.
1:8:29|1:8:33|At that time, Captain Tang was leading Master Shen's family towards this direction.
1:8:33|1:8:36|Upon seeing this, the alliance informed Captain Tang.
1:8:41|1:8:48|[Master Shen] and [Ding Lan] opened the door and entered the boat, only to be shocked by the scene in front of them.
1:8:48|1:8:54|[Ding Lan] hurriedly entered the door to check.
1:8:54|1:8:59|Mary was seen holding the boss lady hostage, [Lung] holding [Xiao Lan], walking out of the cabin, and angrily said.
1:9:11|1:9:20|At this moment, Captain Tang quickly went around to the back door, caught Lung off guard, and the two hurriedly dealt with the situation, releasing the boss lady and Xiao Ding.
1:9:20|1:9:22|The landlady sees Master Shen and shakes her head in gratitude.
1:9:22|1:9:27|At this moment, [Captain Tang] was surrounded by several people, but he managed to subdue them all with his strong skills.
1:9:30|1:9:36|[Mary] and [Yitien] engage in a one-on-one fight, battling from the cabin to the deck. [Yitien] showcases his swift martial arts skills, countering each move with ease.
1:9:36|1:9:43|[Mary] can hold her own, but she seems to be at a disadvantage as the situation progresses.
1:9:43|1:9:49|Facing three opponents, they were no match for her at all. With a swift downward kick, she sent them crashing to the ground.
1:9:50|1:10:2|Captain Tang's situation is even more optimistic. In front of him, Lung is like a wooden dummy used for practice, easily beaten to the point of being completely defeated.
1:10:2|1:10:5|[Han] gradually found himself at a disadvantage, and his strong subordinates immediately rushed to protect him.
1:10:7|1:10:13|Several subordinates responded, although [Chiang Yitien] was highly skilled in martial arts, but after all, facing a large number of enemies, it was a bit difficult to fight.
1:10:13|1:10:22|[Han] just finished off one wave of enemies when another wave came. He agilely dodged their attacks, then took advantage of their distraction by jumping onto the table, stepping on their hands with one foot, and then adding a couple of extra kicks.
1:10:23|1:10:29|Yitien is in a state of chaos here, amidst flashes of blades and swords, his figure intertwining with the enemy's, moving at an extremely fast speed.
1:10:29|1:10:37|The enemies kept coming one after another. Yitien grabbed the rope and swung to the second floor window, taking advantage of the terrain and becoming even more adept.
1:10:37|1:10:42|One by one, his subordinates were taken care of by him, forcing [Xiao Lan] to personally fight him.
1:10:42|1:10:48|The two of them moved like lightning, with their techniques changing rapidly, but it was clear that Han had the upper hand.
1:10:48|1:10:59|On the other side of the ship, Yitien lured the enemy to the corner, where Xiao Ding had already ambushed. With a sweeping kick, he knocked the enemy to the ground, then smugly peeked out to take a look.
1:10:59|1:11:11|[Ding Lan] was about to leave when he saw three people coming in from outside. He skillfully used a set of left and right hooks, plus a back kick, and the three people were instantly knocked to the ground. Even though Yitien was young, he also subdued one of the enemies.
1:11:13|1:11:24|On the other side, [Lung] was heavily thrown against the railing, with [Captain Tang] not giving him any chance to catch his breath. He quickly stepped forward and delivered another punch, sending the opponent spinning in the air before crashing straight to the ground.
1:11:24|1:11:29|In a panic, [Lung] tried to escape, disregarding his dignity, he quickly crawled forward.
1:11:29|1:11:34|Captain Tang caught up, but was caught by the police officers, so he had to deal with the enemy first.
1:11:34|1:11:40|Han is still fighting with Chiang Yitien. Chiang Yitien forces him to the edge of the railing, but Han is not willing to give up and instead jumps onto the mast of the ship.
1:11:41|1:11:45|Yitien immediately reacted, grabbing the rope at the mast and continuing to struggle with him.
1:11:45|1:11:50|[Lung] was chased to a dead end by [Captain Tang], and jumped into the river with a brave face.
1:11:50|1:11:56|Mary saw that the situation was hopeless, slid down the mast to retreat, but Yitien was quicker and caught her.
1:11:56|1:11:58|She was still struggling to break free, hoping to escape.
1:11:58|1:12:2|Captain Tang arrived at the scene and helped to completely subdue her.
1:12:2|1:12:6|Yitien breathed a sigh of relief, while Mary looked unwilling.
1:12:6|1:12:13|[Captain Tang] and [Master Shen] helped the boss lady out of the cabin slowly.
1:12:13|1:12:21|The scene shifts to the factory, where Han is still conducting experiments. However, his face no longer shows pain, and he actually seems to be enjoying taking a drag of the cigarette.
1:12:21|1:12:23|On the other side, Captain Tang sent Xiao Ding home.
1:12:34|1:12:39|In the midst of their conversation, the two stopped in their tracks, only to see Yitien leaning against the wall fast asleep.
1:12:39|1:12:41|Captain Tang said to Xiao Lan.
1:12:51|1:12:54|After Yitien woke up, he got up and chased after him.
1:12:55|1:12:58|After speaking, Yitien walked towards [Xiao Lan] with a rough look on his face.
1:12:58|1:13:1|[Xiao Lan] leaned against the wall, gazing at him intently.
1:14:28|1:14:33|Han slowly walked to Chiang Yitien's side and squatted down, comforting him in a soft voice.
1:14:56|1:14:58|At the end of the day, [Han] fell asleep here, exhausted.
1:14:58|1:15:1|At this moment, the police station is full of danger.
1:15:21|1:15:27|Captain Tang looked around as he entered, with Lung and Owen both turning to him. He paused for a moment, then saluted the chief.
1:16:16|1:16:25|Both of you calm down for now. If you don't release the person, you will be responsible for all consequences. Without explaining, [Captain Tang] turned around and left.
1:16:31|1:16:33|Captain Tang's expression turned serious after listening.
1:16:34|1:16:44|The scene shifts to the laboratory, where the chain-smoking [Chiang Yitien] stealthily reaches for a cigarette on the neighboring table, only to have his hand grabbed by someone who roars in anger.
1:16:44|1:16:52|[Chiang Yitien]'s hand was forcefully twisted behind his head, and soon after, he was thrown out by someone.
1:16:52|1:16:56|[Chiang Yitien], who was expelled from the laboratory, leaned against the railing in despair.
1:16:56|1:17:2|The scene cuts to the office, where Mary is choosing cigarettes. She picks two and hands them to [John McClane]. After smelling them, [John McClane] says to Uncle Seven.
1:17:20|1:17:25|[Chiang Yitien], who was kicked out, is still not giving up. He sneaks back into the lab to look for cigarettes while no one is around.
1:17:25|1:17:30|He, who has never done anything wrong, was unusually cautious, observing at the door for a long time before rushing in.
1:17:31|1:17:36|He sneaked in quietly, looked on the table and then bent down under the table to search through an empty cigarette box.
1:17:36|1:17:41|He acted recklessly, the former gentleness was gone, and he finally found a clue.
1:17:41|1:17:50|He didn't have time to put it in his mouth before the door opened and a group of people walked in and saw him.
1:17:50|1:17:52|They punched and talked at the same time.
1:17:56|1:18:0|[Lung] kicked heavily again after knowing it, the sound startled [Mary].
1:18:0|1:18:10|He pulled back the curtains to look out, and [Han] asked.
1:18:10|1:18:18|Han had been beaten up by Lung and his gang, covered in blood. Xiao Lan calmly opened the window and shouted.
1:18:24|1:18:30|One day, dragged and thrown out of the factory by two henchmen.
1:18:30|1:18:40|One day, he fell heavily on the iron cart at the door. He struggled to get up, but he was too seriously injured. He rolled down along the cart and fainted on the ground.
1:18:40|1:18:44|At this moment at home, [Shen Tinyi] enters the room and greets everyone.
1:19:23|1:19:28|One day, reminiscing about the days when he used to play the clown in the circus.
1:20:5|1:20:19|[Shen Tinyi] sat at the table with a worried look on his face, while [Xiao Ding] paced outside the window for a while before walking in with heavy steps.
1:20:19|1:20:23|[Xiao Ding] hesitated to speak, shook his head with a serious expression, and [Shen Tinyi] already understood in his heart.
1:20:25|1:20:30|[Xiao Mei] excitedly pushed open the door, but the heavy atmosphere in the room made her feel uneasy.
1:20:32|1:20:39|He suddenly realized, looked up at the building, took three steps and then ran up two steps, anxiously asking [Xiao Lan].
1:20:39|1:20:45|[Xiao Lan] glanced at him, not answering, while [Xiao Mei] hurriedly ran towards the room.
1:20:45|1:20:55|One day, memories of the circus days flashed through his mind like a carousel. Back then, the clown would lie on the ground playing dead, only to get up with a laugh after the joke. But this time, the joke became reality.
1:21:4|1:21:12|The quiet night was shattered by a mournful erhu sound, and the day finally couldn't make it through, passing away in the arms of [Xiao Mei].
1:21:12|1:21:17|[Master Shen] looked sorrowfully as he played the erhu, his eyes filled with sadness as he gazed at the sky.
1:21:17|1:21:21|Before long, he closed his eyes, as if recalling the bits and pieces of the day.
1:21:22|1:21:29|At the table, Han was full of spirit, while she lying on the bed looked pale and lifeless.
1:21:29|1:21:34|[Xiao Mei] burns paper money by the stove all day, tears streaming down her face, suppressing the pain in her heart with sobs.
1:21:36|1:21:49|Suddenly, Han stood up angrily, and the others followed suit. Captain Tang put down the erhu and led the group out of the house with determination, showing no sign of fear.
1:21:49|1:21:59|Captain Tang and dozens of police officers secretly caught up, but stopped at the corner. At this moment, a police officer wanted to continue chasing forward, but was stopped by Captain Tang. He asked in confusion.
1:22:8|1:22:13|Captain Tang picked up the compliments from the team members and lowered his head in contemplation, then the scene shifted to the landlady.
1:22:27|1:22:37|The landlady had a determined look in her eyes. At this moment, [Master Shen] and his family had already arrived at the tobacco factory. One person went in from the south and one from the west, opening the lock on the gate, while the others entered through this gate openly.
1:22:37|1:22:42|[Ding Mei] walked at the front, with a determined look in her eyes, determined to avenge her husband.
1:22:42|1:22:49|At the same time, the landlady is having people strap all kinds of explosives onto the boat, which is now just an object to her.
1:22:49|1:22:53|At this moment, she just wanted to do her bit to help her senior brother's family seek revenge.
1:22:54|1:23:3|[Master Shen] and his family entered the scene, and in an instant, a group of people surrounded them. However, the cold light in their eyes made those people retreat step by step.
1:23:3|1:23:9|Han, [John McClane], and Owen looked disdainfully at them on the second floor, when suddenly the thugs inside rushed out with big knives.
1:23:15|1:23:24|Chiang Yitien moves towards Lung, while Master Shen is in charge of the ground. Ding Lan, Ding Ju, and three other children are responsible for clearing out the other people in the area.
1:23:24|1:23:30|[Ding Lan] swung his right arm, his fist fiercely smashing into the enemy's face. He struck fast and hard, the sound of his fist cutting through the air.
1:23:30|1:23:47|Ding [Xiao Ding] raised his hands to the west and north, the three of them spinning like a whirlwind of fire and wind. Wherever they went, no enemy could escape, all were blocked. One man propped up a table with both hands, exerting force, cleanly taking down one enemy with a kick each, instantly resolving all the enemies around them.
1:23:47|1:23:52|Next, Ding [Xiao Ding] and three kids worked closely together to make a large slingshot with rubber bands.
1:23:53|1:23:58|At the command, three large boxes were ejected and slammed heavily onto the enemy's faces.
1:23:58|1:24:1|[Lung] is strong and powerful, making it dangerous and difficult for Han to fight him.
1:24:1|1:24:6|He was punched against the railing, but he countered the move and didn't let [Lung] gain the upper hand.
1:24:6|1:24:14|Ding [Xiao Mei] and [Lung] started fighting, despite his lack of martial arts skills, his legs seemed a bit weak, but his extreme anger made him very brave.
1:24:14|1:24:19|During the fight, Uncle Seven didn't suffer any losses. Seeing this, he tried to escape, but was cut in half by Master [Shen].
1:24:20|1:24:23|Lung was pushed back by Ding Xiao Ding.
1:24:23|1:24:28|Ding [Xiao Mei] grabbed the glass bottle on the table and smashed it in half, then chased after Lung with it raised.
1:24:28|1:24:32|The sharp glass scratched the opponent's face, causing blood to gush out instantly.
1:24:32|1:24:39|Ding Mei pursued heavily, overturned the table trying to pin down [Lung], but accidentally made him fall into the weapons room.
1:24:39|1:24:43|[Lung] opened the box, grabbed a gun and aimed it at Ding Mei, smiling sinisterly and terrifyingly.
1:24:44|1:24:48|Just as he was about to pull the trigger, a flying knife pierced [Lung]'s artery.
1:24:48|1:24:51|Master Shen arrived in time and saved his daughter.
1:24:51|1:24:54|[Lung] struggled for a moment and then fell silent.
1:24:54|1:24:59|At this moment, the landlady's boat was fully loaded, the sailors had coiled up the ropes, and the boat started moving slowly.
1:24:59|1:25:3|Here, Lung restrains Han's hand, making him unable to move.
1:25:3|1:25:7|But the next second, [Lung] struggled to break free, kicking him out several meters away.
1:25:7|1:25:19|Yitien's mouth was full of blood. Arrogant [Lung] was ready to pursue further, while Yitien grabbed a nearby chair and smashed it towards [Lung]'s leg. This made [Lung] even more furious, grabbing Yitien and punching him several times.
1:25:19|1:25:24|Here, Han punched Master Shen in the stomach, and Xiao Lan quickly kicked him away.
1:25:27|1:25:32|Master Shen hadn't had a chance to speak before being ambushed by [Owen] and heavily thrown down the stairs.
1:25:32|1:25:36|Owen wanted to take the opportunity to deal with Ding, but he managed to evade him one by one.
1:25:36|1:25:42|[Mary] seized the opportunity and delivered a series of fierce kicks to Master Shen, who was still recovering. Master Shen struggled to dodge them.
1:25:42|1:25:49|[Chiang Yitien] turned around to resume the fight. Seeing his determination, [Han] contemptuously took off his sunglasses, clenched his fists, ready to completely subdue him.
1:25:49|1:26:0|[Chiang Yitien] took the lead in using the bow, facing the fierce attacks from [Han]. He easily dodged them by using the shooting props in the field. Unable to harm him, [Han] became furious and unleashed a series of kicks, but [Chiang Yitien] effortlessly avoided each one.
1:26:0|1:26:12|But in the end, with the final kick, [Han] played unexpectedly, catching [Chiang Yitien] off guard. The table behind him was kicked several meters away. [Han] poised himself, ready to strike with his leg, a look of arrogance on his face, as he intended to defeat [Chiang Yitien] in one fell swoop.
1:26:15|1:26:27|[Chiang Yitien] angrily rushed forward and embraced [Han] around the waist, trying to control his movements. However, he was struck in the back with an elbow and then choked by Han, causing him to be pushed away and fall to the ground, looking disheveled.
1:26:27|1:26:32|Turning to [Lung], he is calmly adjusting his suit, with a look of arrogance and domineering.
1:26:32|1:26:48|Faced with such provocation, [Chiang Yitien] was furious and suddenly, he had a bright idea. He extended a spring rope from his sleeve and used it to fling a wooden stick towards [Han], then wrapped the spring rope around [Han]'s wrist, leveraging the force to fly towards him and fiercely kick him in the chest.
1:26:48|1:27:4|[Lung] reacted quickly and tried to counterattack using a spring rope. He pulled the rope to bring [Chiang Yitien] closer, but [Chiang Yitien] had a countermeasure ready. Skillfully, he extended the rope and [Lung] failed to harm his opponent, instead getting hit on the chin by the rope. Enraged, he charged towards [Chiang Yitien] for another fierce attack.
1:27:6|1:27:22|Yitien, like a tiger with wings, used a spring rope to wrap around Lung's ankles, hips, and waist. With a strong pull, Lung fell straight to the ground. He tried to stand up and fight back several times, but every time he made a move, he was pulled down. He was thrown to the ground three or four times in a row, his expression gradually becoming fierce.
1:27:23|1:27:30|Owen closely pursued [Xiao Ding], not giving him any chance to fight back. Knowing he couldn't beat him, [Xiao Ding] just kept dodging.
1:27:30|1:27:37|Just as Owen was about to make a fatal move, [Captain Tang] burst in and quickly kicked Owen to the ground, making sure to say to [Han].
1:27:38|1:27:42|[Xiao Ding] was worried about his father, and [Wenyan] quickly ran out the door.
1:27:42|1:27:49|Owen was forced to the wall by [Captain Tang], arrogantly believing he could defeat his opponent, so he adjusted his posture and charged towards [Captain Tang].
1:27:49|1:27:57|However, he is no match for her. [Mary] thought she had the upper hand and launched a series of attacks on [Master Shen].
1:27:57|1:28:1|In fact, Master Shen had a plan long ago. He kicked over the tobacco placed on the cigarette machine.
1:28:2|1:28:15|[Mary] was blinded, her fighting ability plummeted, [Master Shen] took the opportunity to grab her leg and push it towards the cutting machine. She dodged to the side, pressed the start button, and as the machine started, a scream pierced the sky.
1:28:15|1:28:24|At this moment, the landlady ordered the servants to pour the alcohol in every corner of the ship. She held the fuse in her hand, exerting force at the bow of the ship, brimming with excitement.
1:28:26|1:28:31|On the other side, Han secured the spring rope to the wooden beam and swung back and forth holding onto the rope.
1:28:31|1:28:36|Lung was unable to hit or kick [Chiang Yitien], and was repeatedly kicked to the ground.
1:28:36|1:28:40|The big guy who was just arrogant is now being beaten without any ability to fight back.
1:28:40|1:28:44|[Chiang Yitien] delivered a series of kicks, sending Lung into a pile of teapots.
1:28:44|1:28:47|He followed closely behind, wanting to tie him up with a rope.
1:28:47|1:28:50|However, Lung, feeling humiliated and angry, grabbed the spring rope and refused to let go.
1:28:50|1:28:52|The two of them refused to back down and pulled together with all their might.
1:28:54|1:29:1|Captain Tang was about to take down Owen with a straight leg kick, but he was seen through by him and had to change his move, performing a cartwheel instead.
1:29:1|1:29:4|But then, a swift kick swept Owen off his feet and sent him crashing to the ground.
1:29:4|1:29:12|Owen learns Captain Tang's leg sweep, but each move is countered. Just as he stands up, he attempts to use the Two-Finger Wrap to blind Captain Tang.
1:29:12|1:29:17|But [Captain Tang] never gave him a chance to get close, a move of leaping kick sent him flying far away.
1:29:21|1:29:26|Owen wanted to counterattack, but was sent flying back by a series of kicks from [Captain Tang].
1:29:26|1:29:35|As he prepared his stance for the flower fist and mace leg, [Captain Tang] had already set up the situation, but Owen rushed over and deliberately used the leg technique he had just seen through.
1:29:35|1:29:45|Owen wanted to continue using the old method to deal with him, but [Captain Tang] had already quietly taken off his shoes. He quickly pulled his leg back and stepped on Owen's hand that was holding the fixed shoe.
1:29:45|1:29:48|Owen was kicked out of the room by [Captain Tang] before he could react, and fell to his death.
1:29:50|1:30:0|At this moment, [Chiang Yitien] has already tied the spring rope around [Han], but the two have a huge gap in strength. [Chiang Yitien] is kicked down by him again. [Han] uses the rope to pull him closer and continues to block.
1:30:0|1:30:5|[Chiang Yitien] quickly wrapped another rope around the wooden beam to counteract the situation.
1:30:5|1:30:11|But [Lung] pulled hard, the wooden beam broke, and [Chiang Yitien] fell heavily to the ground, looking at [Shen Tinyi] in shock for a moment.
1:30:15|1:30:29|He first wildly swung the rope, making the opponent roll back and forth, then pulled him up and kicked him hard in the stomach. Taking advantage of the opponent's lack of response, he wrapped the rope around the opponent's neck, swiftly tied the remaining rope to a wooden beam, and then pulled the rope to ascend to the upper floor.
1:30:31|1:30:36|[Chiang Yitien] had his arms tied up, despite his martial arts skills, he had no chance to use them.
1:30:36|1:30:42|With Lung's movements, Chiang Yitien gradually lifted off the ground, struggling desperately to break the spring rope but to no avail.
1:30:42|1:30:50|Han exerted all his strength, pulling the rope tightly, even using his feet to push against the railing for leverage. Just as [Chiang Yitien] was being hoisted higher and higher, his face turning pale and almost suffocating.
1:30:51|1:31:3|The rope broke under the strain, causing [Chiang Yitien] to fall to the ground, while Lung, due to inertia, tumbled into the large boiler behind him and was engulfed in flames.
1:31:3|1:31:8|The lucky rescued [Chiang Yitien] sat on the ground, covering his neck and breathing fresh air deeply.
1:31:8|1:31:13|At this moment, John McClane screamed in agony and ran out, instinctively throwing himself at [Chiang Yitien], wanting to die with him.
1:31:13|1:31:18|But [Chiang Yitien], seeing him burned so badly, picked up the bag and risked his life to help put out the fire.
1:31:19|1:31:23|At that moment, the landlady accidentally broke the kerosene lamp and left gracefully.
1:31:23|1:31:27|The explosives on the flower boat instantly ignited the oranges, the deafening sound of the explosion reverberated.
1:31:27|1:31:31|At that moment, Lung took his last breath.
1:31:31|1:31:38|[Shen Tinyi], [Captain Tang] and his family quickly evacuate upon hearing the sound, while Lung and others ultimately perish in the fire, getting their just deserts.
1:31:43|1:31:47|The factory buildings exploded one after another like a row of falling dominoes.
1:31:47|1:31:50|At that moment, flames shot up into the sky in the tobacco field, with thick black smoke billowing.
1:31:50|1:31:56|Master Shen's family of the Robust Alliance ran out, and others from the factory followed one after another.
1:32:1|1:32:5|[Master Shen] led a man and a woman running at the front, with a team following behind them.
1:32:5|1:32:11|Several people ran out and saw the flower boat owned by the landlady, which was burned down to just the windows, and suddenly understood everything.
1:32:15|1:32:20|This absurd incident finally came to an end thanks to everyone's joint efforts.
1:32:20|1:32:25|The situation has calmed down, and the Changfu Circus has received support to return to the stage.
1:32:25|1:32:33|[Master Shen] led everyone back onto the stage as they did at the beginning, waving and smiling under the spotlight to the audience with joy on their faces.
1:32:33|1:32:37|The audience welcomed them back with enthusiastic applause.
1:32:37|1:32:50|At this moment in the circus, [Xiao Mei] takes over as the clown instead of Yitien, the boss lady and [Master Shen] collaborate once again to perform the magic flying knives act, while Han and [Xiao Lan] perform the aerial acrobatics together, fulfilling everyone's wishes.
1:32:50|1:33:2|[Xiao Mei] stood on the spot where her husband once performed, and she remembered the scene of Yitien falling down pretending to be dead. How she wished all of this was just a dream, and that after waking up, the clown would just laugh and stand up again.
1:33:3|1:33:6|But all of this seems to be a fantasy.
1:33:6|1:33:9|[Xiao Mei] woke up from her memories and started performing with a cheerful smile.
1:33:9|1:33:14|She started learning to be a clown who brings joy to others every day.
