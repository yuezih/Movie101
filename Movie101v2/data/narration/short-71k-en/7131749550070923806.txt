0:1:33|0:1:38|Night falls, the bustling streets of Tokyo are illuminated by thousands of lights.
0:1:38|0:1:44|The tram rattled and roared as it passed over the tracks suspended above the crossroads.
0:1:44|0:1:50|At this moment, a woman in a tight leather jacket stops her motorcycle in front of a hotel.
0:1:50|0:1:55|The elevator bell rang and the door opened. At some point, she found herself holding a carefully wrapped rectangular gift box.
0:1:56|0:2:10|Next, [Swan] sneaked into a beautifully decorated large penthouse, placed the gift box in her hand on a crystal glass coffee table, and carefully untied the packaging rope on the gift box.
0:2:10|0:2:17|A butter cake catches the eye, but upon closer inspection, the center of the cake seems to conceal a liquid capsule.
0:2:17|0:2:22|Once everything was settled, [Leather Jacket Woman] hung up the phone and hurried back to the hotel downstairs.
0:2:22|0:2:27|As soon as the door of the building was pushed open, a huge fire could be seen halfway up the towering hotel.
0:2:28|0:2:32|Before long, the surroundings were shrouded in billowing smoke.
0:2:32|0:2:41|The explosion's flames strangely added a touch of beauty to the dazzling night, as [SWAN] walked away without looking back.
0:2:41|0:2:49|At the same time in Hong Kong, at the UFS International press conference, the host is passionately introducing the key employees, player [David Marshall].
0:2:51|0:2:57|The moment the voiceover began, the spotlight shone directly on a young man with a stubble and small braids tied up.
0:3:2|0:3:10|And not far from him, an Asian man in a sharp suit with earphones plugged in was patrolling back and forth inside the venue. 
0:3:10|0:3:12|At this moment, the host's voice was heard again.
0:3:12|0:3:21|Today's press conference, which covers all three weight classes of UFS, is a party exclusively for the player [David Marshall].
0:3:21|0:3:27|At the same time, the audience present are all witnesses of history, and no one in the future can stop them.
0:3:27|0:3:31|The host then asked the journalists in the audience if they had any questions.
0:3:41|0:3:48|[David Marshall] immediately rushed down the stage, and the Asian Men's Alliance raised the walkie-talkie.
0:3:48|0:3:56|At this moment, at the back of the stage, a handsome guy dressed similarly to the Asian man is sound asleep, with the Asian man's voice occasionally coming through the headphones.
0:4:0|0:4:10|The handsome [Li Shan] was finally awakened by the noise. As soon as he arrived in the hall, he saw that [David Marshall] had already grabbed the female journalist's collar, with a slap about to land on her.
0:4:10|0:4:18|Asha rushed to the two of them, pushed away Li Shan's arm with an elbow, and then threw the other person to the ground.
0:4:28|0:4:38|[Li Shan] wanted to show off in front of the female reporter, playing the hero to save the beauty. Little did he know, he got the situation wrong and ended up being knocked on the back of his head by an Asian man who jumped up in anger.
0:4:38|0:4:44|Continuing, the two of them awkwardly smiled at the reporters and occasionally glanced back at the unlucky [David Marshall].
0:4:44|0:4:48|The farce ended, the two of them drove to the street.
0:5:0|0:5:23|[Li Shan] lay on the passenger seat, facing the Asian man. Due to his excitement, the Asian man pushed hard, causing the seat beneath him to slide straight back and the steering wheel to slip from his hands. [Li Shan] quickly controlled the direction with his foot.
0:5:39|0:5:51|Upon hearing Asen mention changing the location again, the Asian man Li Shan was initially puzzled, but after hearing a few more words from the other party, he suddenly smiled, tapped his head and said "wait a moment", then looked towards [Li Shan].
0:6:8|0:6:15|An Asian man looked excitedly towards the wild mountains, then tightly gripped the steering wheel with both hands and stepped on the gas pedal, ready to set off.
0:6:15|0:6:22|As soon as Ke Gang stepped on the gas, the car, like an old man with asthma, swayed back and forth as it sucked in the fire.
0:6:22|0:6:32|At this moment, upon closer inspection, Li Shan had already concealed the color of the vehicle itself, and with a light touch, the rearview mirror could easily fall off. The scene then shifted to the two brothers arriving at Lianchuan.
0:6:42|0:6:46|Outside the airport, an Asian man hands a business card to [Li Shan].
0:6:59|0:7:2|An Asian man shouted that he loves Korea, then he put his arm around [Li Shan] and quickly walked towards the taxi stand outside the airport.
0:7:18|0:7:37|The two brothers quickly arrived at the lobby of a hotel, where they heard an Asian man talking on the phone, saying he had already arrived. Then, a middle-aged foreigner with gray hair stood up and gestured towards them. The Asian man was puzzled why the person who commissioned them didn't come together. Suddenly, a text message came through on the phone of the foreigner, [Ayo].
0:7:40|0:7:43|The three of them kept ringing the doorbell outside, but no one answered.
0:7:43|0:7:48|[Li Shan] couldn't resist knocking on the door when he heard [Ayo] say this was the place.
0:7:48|0:7:52|The Asian man was about to kick the door when he glanced at the waitress and said.
0:8:4|0:8:10|The waiter saw Li Shan, an Asian man, clutching his stomach and screaming in pain, and he took out a room key card to open the door.
0:8:10|0:8:16|Seeing the door being opened, he shouted in Korean to hurry up, and rushed straight into the room.
0:8:16|0:8:27|Upon entering the room, [Li Shan] noticed an unopened birthday cake placed on the center of the dining table. Seeing that the recipient was [Ayo], he turned and asked if the cake was meant for him.
0:8:27|0:8:37|[Ayo] denied it, then looked down to see it was a call from the client, he quickly answered. But the next second, he felt something was wrong, because the other party actually asked him where he was right now.
0:8:59|0:9:7|Thinking of hanging up the phone, but the other party actually guessed that there was cake and red wine in room 2003, scaring [Ayo] into immediately looking at these two things.
0:9:8|0:9:13|Little did anyone know, [Li Shan] had already cut a piece of cake and was enjoying it heartily.
0:9:23|0:9:24|Gradually revealing its brilliance.
0:9:27|0:9:38|In the underground parking lot, [Li Shan] put his arm around the shoulder of the Asian man, asking in confusion. With no answer in sight, he reluctantly opened the passenger door and slowly got in.
0:9:38|0:9:45|In the parking lot, it suddenly went pitch black. The Asian man sitting in the back seat just turned on the car's dome light when he was abruptly extinguished by [Li Shan].
0:9:57|0:10:2|As soon as the words fell, a beam of strong light shone over.
0:10:6|0:10:13|[Li Shan] looked through the gap and saw a long-haired man casually tossing a palm-sized disc in front of him.
0:10:14|0:10:17|The next second, he was firmly attached to the front windshield.
0:10:17|0:10:29|In less than two seconds, a laser emitted from the center of the disc cut a hole in the glass, followed by thick smoke filling the cramped carriage.
0:10:29|0:10:32|Watching a group of black-clad individuals wearing gas masks take [Ayo] away.
0:10:38|0:10:46|The Asian man, also known as Ayo, leaped towards the ambulance opened by the men in black without waiting for Li Shan to stop him.
0:10:46|0:10:52|Unfortunately, the aim was off, and it went straight through the space between the two doors at the back of the ambulance.
0:10:52|0:10:58|I wanted to get up and chase again, but after falling heavily to the ground, I couldn't use my waist strength.
0:10:58|0:11:6|Li Shan quickly climbed up from beside the car door and ran towards Ayo. Suddenly, the entire hotel shook, and debris kept falling down along the wall.
0:11:29|0:11:47|Seeing the ambulance about to disappear around the corner, [Li Shan] hurriedly urged [Ayo]. Unfortunately, the traffic light turned on just then. The man in black decisively pressed the button, activating the ambulance's emergency siren. Instantly, it smoothly maneuvered through the busy road, with the two brothers quickly following suit.
0:11:47|0:11:50|But in an instant, it caused chaos in the surrounding traffic.
0:12:2|0:12:8|But soon, the two of them quickly picked themselves up and stared fixedly at the old warehouse car not far away, accelerating to chase after it.
0:12:8|0:12:13|The intersection quickly became congested, but the instigator's fate was unpredictable and gone.
0:12:13|0:12:25|Suddenly, a two-meter tall off-road vehicle rushed straight from the rear side, crashing into the sedan at the intersection, then stepping on the gas pedal to lift one side of the car and pressing down on the hood of the other sedan as it chased after the old warehouse car.
0:12:28|0:12:37|The woman in the driver's seat glanced at the passenger seat, looking at the two brothers' well-defined figures, and a faint smile played on her fiery lips.
0:12:44|0:12:49|The glamorous woman then stepped on the gas pedal and rammed straight into the back of Li Shan's car.
0:12:49|0:12:53|The steering wheel in Li Shan's hand slipped and the car rushed towards the inner lane being maintained.
0:13:35|0:13:43|The seductive woman gave a devilish smile, and the latter immediately picked up a tablet, and the off-road vehicle instantly connected to the electronic sensing system.
0:13:43|0:13:49|The next moment, the glamorous woman stepped over to the driver's side window, her right hand tightly gripping the luggage rack on the roof.
0:13:49|0:13:58|After Daitian used the computer to accelerate the speed of the car, he swung a silver ball with his left hand towards the ambulance roof. The ball, after falling, firmly attached itself to the roof.
0:13:59|0:14:2|And then, a laser beam split the ball in two.
0:14:2|0:14:7|At the bottom of the sphere, a long circular section was cut off by a laser.
0:14:7|0:14:15|The seductive woman took the opportunity to leap up and descend from the sky, blocking the inside of the ambulance, picking up a stun gun and aiming it at the black-clothed men inside.
0:14:15|0:14:21|At the same moment, the provoked Li Shan was driving the soon-to-be-scrapped car closely behind.
0:14:21|0:14:28|In the passenger seat, [Ayo] who pretended to be unconscious, glanced at [Li Shan] with narrowed eyes, then quietly fastened the seatbelt.
0:14:29|0:14:39|In the ambulance, [Swan] quickly took care of the black-clothed man in the back seat, then moved forward, with her left leg straight against the driver's neck, and her right elbow fiercely gripping the throat of the co-driver.
0:14:39|0:14:47|At this moment, [Li Shan] stepped on the gas pedal, crashing into the rear of the ambulance. [Ling Xin] was caught off guard and couldn't dodge in time, slamming back into the rear seat.
0:14:47|0:14:52|[Ling Xin] quickly got up and rushed towards the driver, tightly gripping his neck from behind.
0:14:53|0:15:3|[Li Shan] then rammed into the ambulance again, hitting the rear of the vehicle. The already precarious front hood was instantly flipped over, and the vehicle behind couldn't dodge in time, resulting in a head-on collision.
0:15:9|0:15:16|The character [Ayo], who had been pretending to be unconscious, suddenly widened his eyes, then raised both hands high and firmly gripped the handle above the car window.
0:15:16|0:15:28|At this moment, [Li Shan] stepped on the gas pedal, quickly moved forward parallel to the ambulance, and then violently hit the side of the ambulance to the left. [Ling Xin], who had already controlled the steering wheel, saw a bend ahead.
0:15:28|0:15:33|Suddenly stepping on the brake, the rubber tires left two tracks on the ground, then accelerated to avoid the collision with [Li Shan].
0:15:55|0:16:5|Brother Yo was about to get off the car when he looked up and saw [Ling Xin] striding towards him aggressively.
0:16:5|0:16:10|Ayo just opened the car door and stepped out, [Ling Xin] raised her hand and fired a shot at him.
0:16:16|0:16:20|Seeing [Ling Xin] charging towards him, [Li Shan] quickly slipped out from the passenger seat.
0:16:24|0:16:33|As soon as the words fell, [Ling Xin] pulled out the stun gun again and rushed towards [Li Shan], but [Li Shan] stepped on the ground, supported himself on the car roof with both hands, and flipped in front of [Ling Xin].
0:16:33|0:16:44|In the blink of an eye, [Li Shan] pulled out a collapsible baton from his waist and struck the glamorous woman directly in the face. After the glamorous woman dodged to the side, he then pressed the baton against her back.
0:16:45|0:17:1|With a flick of the hand, the electric machine gun was disarmed, the seductive woman who suffered a loss, a scorpion tail swung straight at [Li Shan]'s back of the head, deftly avoiding the suppression, then both feet landed on the car door, empty-handed and fell, the right foot struck [Li Shan]'s head, but just as he picked up the machine gun, it was snatched away by [Li Shan] who leaned over.
0:17:1|0:17:5|At this moment, the ambulance suddenly revved its engine and sped away from the scene.
0:17:5|0:17:9|[Li Shan] hesitated for a moment, then dropped the gun and headed towards the ambulance.
0:17:9|0:17:19|Water had just taken a few steps when a violent explosion occurred on the ambulance, and the shock wave instantly knocked [Li Shan] over, hitting the car on the side of the road before falling heavily to the ground.
0:17:19|0:17:28|Late at night, by the quiet dock, [Li Shan] and Ayo had their hands tied behind their backs, awakened by a man from the Central Union splashing water on them. Not far away were the glamorous woman and Swan.
0:17:52|0:17:58|The news reported that a terrorist attack has just occurred at Incheon Hotel A, with surveillance footage capturing two suspects.
0:18:3|0:18:11|In the news, not only are [Li Shan] and Ayo listed as wanted criminals, but also the information of the enchanting woman and two others is prominently featured.
0:18:53|0:19:2|Hearing the seductive woman's instructions, [Ayo] prevents Li Shan from approaching Big Brother and lifts him up into the air, then throws him into the water.
0:19:47|0:19:47|38 years old.
0:20:32|0:20:34|Qiao Ge picked up the portrait and looked at it.
0:22:6|0:22:12|Afraid that [Li Shan] might say something detrimental to the cooperation, Ayo quickly raised his glass to propose a toast.
0:22:12|0:22:19|The five of them enjoyed fine wine on the luxurious yacht, engaging in conversations that were strangely harmonious.
0:22:19|0:22:28|The next morning, a private plane arrogantly flew towards Thailand, [Ayo] handed a cup of coffee to interrupt [Li Shan] who was staring at the sunrise.
0:22:30|0:22:35|[Ayo] lounged on the leather sofa chair, taking a big sip of juice.
0:22:35|0:22:37|[Ling Xin] looked at him and then asked.
0:22:47|0:22:49|[Ayo] awkwardly smiles.
0:22:55|0:22:58|[Swan] pushed [Ayo]'s funny face out for everyone to enjoy.
0:23:21|0:23:25|Katie changed into a flight suit and stood in front of [Li Shan].
0:23:33|0:23:44|Watching [Ayo] in a flight suit, bracing against the wind on the edge of the cabin for mental preparation, Katie suddenly kicked him in the back, then leaped into the air from ten thousand meters high.
0:23:44|0:23:49|The other three quickly put on their red goggles and leaped out of the cabin with their arms open.
0:23:50|0:23:57|The tall and long-legged [Li Shan] continuously adjusts his posture in the air, with his arms close together and hands clasped, heading straight towards [Li Shan].
0:23:57|0:24:2|Before long, [Li Shan] pressed the button on his backpack and the parachute opened with a whoosh.
0:24:2|0:24:13|Li Shan, Ayo, Ling Xin, Swan, and Tom, who have changed out of their flight suits, now stand in front of a high-end shopping mall.
0:24:13|0:24:19|The brothers Li Shan and Ayo complained, while Katie walked to the mall in high heels of nearly ten centimeters.
0:24:43|0:24:47|Katie then took the two brothers to a high-end men's clothing store.
0:24:47|0:24:51|The manager brought out two rows of suits for Li Shan and Ayo to choose from.
0:25:7|0:25:14|Tian Ke looked at the 1.87-meter-tall, sharp-eyed and sharp-edged [Li Shan], lightly bumping into Katie's shoulder with a mischievous smile on his face.
0:25:14|0:25:20|At this moment, [Li Shan] put on a bright striped suit, adjusted the French bow tie around his neck, and walked towards the mirror.
0:25:24|0:25:27|Katie took a big step towards [Li Shan] and helped her adjust her bow tie.
0:25:38|0:25:51|The newly-suited Ayo raised his eyebrows and asked, then was pulled to sit in front of a mirror. He saw Swan dig out a layer of hair mud with two fingers, then wiped it on Ayo's hairline.
0:26:21|0:26:33|Li Shan has finished styling Ayo's hair. Ayo looks up and sees his reflection in the mirror, his bangs, which were originally neatly in place, now sticking up like an octopus tentacle on his forehead.
0:26:33|0:26:39|Ri Ge touched his already fixed hairstyle, then suddenly smiled, indicating his great satisfaction.
0:26:39|0:26:44|Putting on a three-piece suit, Li Shan swaggered behind Katie and the other two.
0:26:44|0:26:50|At this moment, [Li Shan] in a short leather jacket, approaches from the side and walks in the middle of the group.
0:26:50|0:26:54|The high nose bridge is casually adorned with sunglasses, exuding a cold and arrogant Southern aura.
0:27:6|0:27:11|In the RV, [SWAN] sticks a small paper-sized transmitter behind Ling Xin's ear.
0:27:11|0:27:17|At this moment, there was a strange sound coming from the computer. It turned out that Ayo had placed the transmitter on his forehead.
0:27:17|0:27:19|Li Shan whimsically swayed his neck.
0:27:46|0:27:51|At the seaside open-air market, Li Shan is holding a coconut drink, following behind a man in a baseball cap.
0:27:57|0:27:59|The two then sat at a small table by the roadside.
0:28:6|0:28:12|But the man in the baseball cap just lowered his head and took a bite of the sausage in his hand, indicating that he was unaware of the situation.
0:28:12|0:28:20|Rioge had no choice but to give up. He gestured towards the table full of snacks, indicating for the man in the baseball cap to enjoy them slowly, then picked up his suit jacket and left.
0:28:30|0:28:36|In the hanging building not far from the market, Righo's voice is transmitted to [Li Shan] through the conductor.
0:28:36|0:28:50|Glancing back once again, Li Shan saw the man in the baseball cap quickly take out his phone and speak in a low voice after Right Brother left the market. Right Brother, with an ice cream in his mouth, turned into a dark alley without paying any attention to the two burly men following behind him.
0:28:50|0:28:54|[Li Shan] sat at the end of the alley, leisurely peeling an apple with a knife.
0:29:1|0:29:7|She couldn't stand it and raised her hand to make a direct wave, the small knife instantly disappearing under the crotch of the man with long hair and a strong build.
0:29:7|0:29:19|At this moment, Li Shan with long hair stood in front of the burly man, lifted the knife handle heavily, asking where Tom was, while Ayo picked up the snacks that had accidentally fallen on the ground and walked towards the RV with a juice in hand.
0:29:43|0:29:46|Katie took a few bites of the grilled skewers and then hurriedly walked down from the RV.
0:29:46|0:29:50|Li Shan gestured with his hand for Ayo to catch up, as she saw him standing still.
0:29:50|0:29:54|The two quickly sneaked into [Du Mupa's girlfriend]'s house in the dark.
0:29:54|0:30:0|Katie tiptoed into the living room, took out her portable button camera, and placed it in the eye of the toy bear.
0:30:6|0:30:13|Upon hearing [SWAN]'s response, [Li Shan] had no choice but to give up and then turned to walk towards [Tom]'s girlfriend's room.
0:30:13|0:30:16|Approaching the bedside table, [Li Shan] leaned over and picked up her phone.
0:30:16|0:30:21|At this moment, Katie Dove approached [Li Shan] and handed her a data reader.
0:30:56|0:31:5|Just as [Li Shan] was saying he wasn't afraid, he suddenly jumped three feet and collapsed on the table by the window.
0:31:5|0:31:10|After successfully copying the phone data, [Li Shan] and Katie walked slowly down the steps side by side.
0:31:37|0:31:44|In front of the computer, Li Shan saw Katie being stunned by the delivery guy.
0:31:44|0:31:51|Originally, [Baby], who was still smug and content, suddenly stood up straight, pulled out a stun gun, and rushed out of the RV.
0:31:51|0:32:1|Unable to catch up in time, Li Shan had to change his target. After stunning another group of black-clothed men with a gun who were planning to escape by car, he seized their car and drove out of the alley.
0:32:44|0:32:49|Ri Ge picked up his phone, looked at the location of the two people, and exclaimed excitedly.
0:32:49|0:32:56|Sitting in the corner, Katie blinked her eyes and tried to avoid any physical contact with [Li Shan].
0:32:56|0:33:0|[Li Shan] reached behind with one hand, but couldn't find the switch no matter how hard he tried.
0:33:9|0:33:18|Katie, who had also freed her hands, extended her single arm and charged straight ahead, but always ended up bumping into Li Shan's waist and hips while feeling her way around.
0:33:18|0:33:27|[Li Shan] grabbed Katie around the waist and carried her to the side of the door, just as the car suddenly passed over a speed bump, causing the newly opened trunk to slam shut tightly once again.
0:33:31|0:33:50|At this moment, [Li Shan] embraced Katie, his right arm gently supporting her waist, while his left hand reached for the button on the car door again. When Katie realized what was happening, she shyly leaned against [Li Shan]'s neck, and then pulled down the door that had just opened once more.
0:33:50|0:33:52|Li Shan lowered his head and asked Katie, who was close at hand.
0:34:2|0:34:9|Ayo stepped on the gas pedal and accelerated away.
0:34:9|0:34:18|Brother Li Shan was staring at the car in front of him, chasing closely. When he heard what Katie said, he instantly felt something was wrong and slammed on the brakes.
0:34:18|0:34:23|Without the car coming to a stop, [Li Shan] and Katie rolled out of the trunk, then ran wildly on the main road.
0:34:31|0:34:35|Driving towards them in the RV, [Baby] pointed behind [Li Shan].
0:34:35|0:34:39|Brother Li Shan bent over and got out of the car with the open trunk.
0:34:39|0:34:43|At this moment, [Swan] runs towards the crowd.
0:34:43|0:34:48|Ignoring the recent blunder, everyone quickly followed [SWAN] back into the RV.
0:35:40|0:35:43|Everyone followed [Ayo]'s hand and looked ahead.
0:35:46|0:35:49|The sign of the West Puan Hotel came into view.
0:36:33|0:36:38|The camera zooms in, a bearded man stands by the door.
0:36:58|0:37:5|Seeing Li Shan leaving, Ayo urged Katie again, then immediately got up and sat in Katie's place.
0:37:30|0:37:33|Ayo awkwardly got up and slowly walked down from the RV.
0:37:43|0:37:53|[Li Shan] and Katie walked out of the elevator one after the other, bickering along the way. They passed by crystal chandeliers and finally arrived at the door of Room 1210.
0:37:53|0:38:1|At this moment, Du Mupa suddenly opened the door, and [Li Shan] quickly seized the opportunity, grabbing the back of Katie's head and kissing her directly.
0:38:1|0:38:7|Ke Dumupa discovered the uncertainty, turned sideways and flashed back into the room, isolating the two who were about to steal the car outside the door.
0:38:8|0:38:12|Then, he picked up the submachine gun and fired a burst of shots at the gate.
0:38:12|0:38:16|[Li Shan] took advantage of her reloading break and used his fist to push open the already dilapidated door.
0:38:16|0:38:21|Katie helped Li Shan up and then raised the stun gun to shoot at Tom.
0:38:21|0:38:26|[Li Shan] took advantage of Duma's evasion to rise up and knocked her assault rifle out with one elbow.
0:38:27|0:38:30|Immediately, [Li Shan] twisted his shoulder and pulled him down to the ground.
0:38:30|0:38:36|Unexpectedly, as Dumupa fell to the ground, another kick flew directly into Li Shan's abdomen.
0:38:41|0:38:43|With another twist, Li Shan had already rushed to the front.
0:38:44|0:38:56|Li Shan jumped up from the ground, with his left foot on the bed for support, and his right foot kicking directly at Du Mupa's face. This flying kick sent Du Mupa's spine crashing heavily onto the glass coffee table behind him.
0:38:56|0:39:9|Li Shan then bent down and grabbed her collar, intending to ask for an explanation. But seeing Du Mupai looking anxiously towards the cake box on the corner of the room's desk, she stopped in her tracks and carefully opened it.
0:39:18|0:39:24|Du Mupaze was surprised why [Li Shan] knew the cake was a bomb, and listened to what [Li Shan] said.
0:39:35|0:39:39|As soon as the words fell, a strange sound came from the well in Du Mupapa.
0:39:39|0:39:43|[Li Shan] pulled open her collar, revealing a necklace-shaped bomb counting down.
0:40:18|0:40:25|The countdown sound effects became more and more urgent, Du Mupa pushed away Katie's hands with one hand, twisted and ran towards the bathroom in the room.
0:40:26|0:40:34|With a loud bang, flames instantly engulfed the entire living room, and the intense shockwave directly knocked Li Shan and Katie to the ground.
0:40:36|0:40:47|[Li Shan] pulled the chair and smashed the window on the ground.
0:40:47|0:40:52|Katie is still not giving up, she plans to continue questioning Southeast Han in the bathroom.
0:40:52|0:40:55|Li Shan pulled him over and then jumped off the twelfth floor.
0:40:57|0:41:3|In the RV, the three of them, already shocked by the explosion, anxiously look towards the hotel building.
0:41:3|0:41:11|[Li Shan] was seen adjusting his posture in mid-air as he leaped out of the window, half embracing Katie with his back facing upwards, and fell straight into the open-air swimming pool below.
0:41:12|0:41:21|At this moment, in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows of another hotel across the street, a slender figure extended his right arm and elegantly played with the firelight in the air.
0:41:21|0:41:29|After the dust settled, the next morning in the RV was so cold and silent, [Li Shan] looked at Li Shan and Catty and said.
0:41:41|0:41:44|[SWAN] awkwardly pursed his lips in an attempt to liven up the atmosphere.
0:41:51|0:41:56|In the RV, [Li Shan] and Katie sit opposite each other, arguing loudly.
0:42:6|0:42:12|Katie inexplicably shifted her gaze back to [Li Shan] and then took a deep breath.
0:42:20|0:42:24|Katie banged on the door, swaggered in, leaving four people standing in place.
0:42:25|0:42:29|[Li Shan] scraped the ground with his heel and took the lead, walking forward.
0:42:37|0:42:41|[Li Shan] stopped moving forward, looked down, and suddenly, a heavy truck rushed out from the side of the road.
0:42:59|0:43:5|[Li Shan] looked towards the end of the road, only to see Katie's RV being hit by the werewolf.
0:43:5|0:43:10|Four burly men got off the truck, ready to take Katie away, when suddenly [Li Shan] rushed towards them.
0:43:10|0:43:16|The leader raised his hand and fired a shot, only to see a tranquilizer dart firmly pierce Li Shan's right arm.
0:43:16|0:43:24|[Li Shan] didn't have time to think too much. He quickly grabbed a long anesthesia needle with his left hand, reached into his waist with his right hand, and swung out the expandable baton straight towards the opponent's face.
0:43:25|0:43:31|Li Shan swiftly bent down, wielding a retractable staff, and ended the battle with just a few moves.
0:43:31|0:43:40|Unfortunately, the tranquilizer suddenly took effect. The leader took advantage of Li Shan's daze, got up, and slammed his head heavily into Li Shan's waist.
0:43:40|0:43:45|[Li Shan] instinctively struck the back of the opponent's head with his elbow, then collapsed softly on the ground.
0:43:48|0:43:53|In a state of unconsciousness, it seemed like the sound of children playing and frolicking in the alley could be heard.
0:43:53|0:43:56|The voice of the child was getting closer and closer.
0:43:56|0:44:2|Before long, the children's voices simultaneously stopped in a small wooden cabin.
0:44:2|0:44:7|On a low bed that barely reaches the knees, a boy is approaching the unconscious [Li Shan] with a string of grilled snacks in his hand.
0:44:9|0:44:14|Seeing [Li Shan] suddenly wake up, the children scattered and ran outside.
0:44:14|0:44:17|[Li Shan] propped himself up with one arm and looked around.
0:44:17|0:44:23|At the head of the bed, the hollow humidifier is working slowly, and the warm light on the ceiling helps people fall asleep.
0:44:23|0:44:28|Afterwards, [Li Shan] stood up and walked outside, following a bamboo path to the end.
0:44:28|0:44:33|In front of them, the tall trees were decorated with lights and the high canopy was full of people.
0:44:38|0:44:41|Ayo and Li Shan, the newlyweds, bow to the guests in gratitude.
0:44:58|0:45:2|[Li Shan] and Ayo looked around, searching for Katie's figure.
0:45:2|0:45:7|The next moment, Katie walked past the guests and stood smiling in front of the two.
0:45:7|0:45:9|[Baby] is roasting a whole lamb on the other side.
0:45:18|0:45:22|Tianke gnawed on corn, looking at Li Shan and Katie in front of the cabin.
0:45:26|0:45:31|After a moment of silence, [Li Shan] leaned his arms against the railing of the wooden house spring and spoke to the person beside him.
0:45:40|0:45:43|Katie turned her head and looked up to ask [Li Shan].
0:45:46|0:45:52|[Li Shan] heard this and slowly avoided Katie's gaze, turning his eyes to the crowd celebrating in front of him.
0:45:54|0:45:57|Katie smiled lightly and didn't press for more answers.
0:46:24|0:46:31|At some point, Li Shan, who was gazing ahead, unexpectedly had tears in his eyes. Katie looked away and sighed.
0:46:37|0:46:41|Speak up, Katie turned her head to look at [Li Shan] again, but smiled and pursed her lips.
0:46:54|0:47:4|In a playful moment, Li Shan's emotions returned to normal. He smiled at Katie, and just as the two were bantering, the sound of fireworks suddenly rang in their ears.
0:47:4|0:47:14|They turned their heads in unison towards the front following the sound, where colorful flags and lanterns hanging on the branches adorned the central area of the crowded forest pavilion, creating a very harmonious and warm atmosphere.
0:47:15|0:47:37|The sky was filled with sky lanterns carrying the hopes and dreams of people of all ages and genders. As they rose slowly into the hazy moonlight, a message came through on Tianke's phone. Singapore has expressed its stance on the terrorist attack, promising to hold the responsible parties accountable and collaborate with Thailand and Interpol in the future.
0:47:45|0:47:49|Ayo was staring at the news footage, muttering to himself.
0:48:0|0:48:5|Next to the spokesperson, a woman in a [Ling Xin] suit caught Ayo's attention.
0:48:20|0:48:23|Tianke pulled up the woman's information and showed it to everyone.
0:48:37|0:48:39|Tianke lightly taps the keyboard, and a message pops up.
0:48:56|0:49:1|Katie assigned tasks clearly, and everyone immediately left the cabin to start preparing.
0:49:1|0:49:6|The next morning, a group of five people boarded a comfortable and luxurious private plane.
0:49:42|0:50:4|[Baby] quickly used a napkin to wipe [Li Shan]'s pants. At this time, [Ayo] crawled out of the rear cabin with a lesson from last time, and was the first to put on the landing suit. "I'm ready to jump," he said. By the shady, snow-like, soft and cloud-like beach, facing the sea, bathing in the morning sun, stands the towering A Hotel.
0:50:4|0:50:10|And facing the cliff above A Hotel, another five-story villa also shines with a touch of sunlight.
0:50:11|0:50:19|At this moment, the elevator bell rings and the door opens in the villa. Katie enters the luxurious hall first, then stands in front of the leather sofa.
0:50:19|0:50:30|Next, [Li Shan] raised his hand across the sofa, and the curtains in front of him fell as if by sensing, allowing the sunlight to trickle into the spacious and desolate hall through the tall French windows.
0:50:30|0:50:38|Li Shan and Ayo, who were walking at the back, stopped in their tracks and stood still when they saw the scene ahead.
0:50:38|0:50:47|Tianke felt like he was back home, first picking up a glass of water and taking a sip, then walking to the side of the marble platform.
0:50:47|0:50:59|Calling out to [Li Shan] and [Ayo], he pressed a button on the stage and a mist sprayed out. Suddenly, an oval-shaped secret door opened, revealing a display case filled with various lipsticks, hair gels, and other cosmetics.
0:51:4|0:51:8|[Li Shan] and [Ayo] couldn't help but come to the display case.
0:51:8|0:51:13|[Ayo] couldn't help but step forward and pick up a cylindrical bottle of hair gel.
0:51:49|0:51:51|[Li Shan] looked at the electrified baton.
0:52:41|0:52:58|One person on the left and one person on the right grabbed his trousers and pulled them down, then turned around and threw them into the small fountain.
0:53:13|0:53:20|Li Shan, who thought it wouldn't explode, argued as he stood up and looked at the mess in front of him.
0:53:20|0:53:26|At the moment of the explosion, [Baby], who was standing in front of Katie, quickly got up and pulled the two of them away.
0:53:26|0:53:30|Continuing, the four of them exchanged a smile and looked helplessly at [Ayo] hiding beside the fountain.
0:53:32|0:53:37|He, with only his underwear on the lower half of his body, launched an attack on the city, covering his face and crying in pain.
0:53:37|0:53:41|After a brief farce, the five of them split up and began to take action.
0:53:41|0:53:47|In a busy dock, a crane is slowly lowering a container onto a truck.
0:53:47|0:53:50|After getting ready, the truck followed a sedan and left the dock.
0:53:51|0:53:55|In a hidden corner, a camper van followed closely behind.
0:53:55|0:54:4|On the other side, [Li Shan] arrived at the top floor of Hotel A, put on special sunglasses, and could even see the figures of people below through the floor.
0:54:4|0:54:9|[Baby] drills with a hammer, creating several small holes about 10 centimeters deep in the ground.
0:54:9|0:54:16|Later, [Li Shan] carefully took out a small tube that looked like mascara, removed the core inside, and placed it in the hole.
0:54:18|0:54:25|A man in a floral shirt bows as he opens the car door for [Ayo].
0:54:25|0:54:31|Watching Mei Yi's car drive away, Li Shan slowly lifted his floral shirt and bent his waist to 90 degrees.
0:54:43|0:54:49|In the warehouse, the aunties stood on either side of a long table, picking out the dragon fruits from the wooden racks.
0:54:58|0:55:11|The floral shirt carefully picked out the small bags hidden in the pile of dragon fruits and opened them one by one, putting the contents inside into the delicate aluminum box, only to be interrupted by the voice of [Li Shan].
0:55:27|0:55:47|Li Shan looked at the empty warehouse and raised his hand towards Ayo, who was wearing a floral shirt, and said confidently. Ayo then turned around and ran towards a rolling shutter door, gesturing towards the three of them. Inside was a small room about ten meters square, densely packed with around fifty thugs.
0:55:47|0:55:57|Raising their eyes to understand the signal of the floral shirt, the group of people put down the dragon fruits in their hands and brandished the small knives they carried with them, shouting as they charged straight out of the cabin.
0:55:57|0:56:4|Before long, the floral shirt led them to the three of them.
0:56:4|0:56:5|The man in the floral shirt smiled and tilted his head back.
0:56:7|0:56:13|The bald thug standing behind him even picked up the back of the knife and ran it over his own head.
0:56:13|0:56:18|[Li Shan] and Ayo exchanged a smile, then lifted their feet and headed towards the direction of Huacui Mountain.
0:56:18|0:56:22|Before the fight begins, Katie kicks down the ladder and steps on the railing of the second floor.
0:56:32|0:56:45|The water pipes on the ceiling burst one after another, spraying water directly towards the people on the first floor.
0:57:5|0:57:13|The people who had already been soaked in water could only watch helplessly as the electric current passed through the ground from their calves and slowly extended to their whole bodies.
0:57:13|0:57:15|Soon, [Li Shan] was tied back to the suite.
0:58:38|0:58:44|In a moment of contemplation, the doorbell suddenly rang, startling [Ayo] into pulling the trigger, causing the floral shirt to instantly collapse.
0:58:50|0:58:53|Tom, with heavy eyeliner, answers the doorbell on the monitor.
0:58:54|0:58:59|Katie looked at the floral shirt already passed out in the fountain, muttering.
0:58:59|0:59:3|The elevator door opens, and [Tom] in floral shorts steps into the room.
0:59:14|0:59:26|[Tom] curiously looked around the room, then stood in front of Katie, taking out four small tubes resembling mascara.
0:59:32|0:59:38|Tom, with a constant smile on his lips, casually placed the small tube into the glass jar in front of him.
0:59:38|0:59:40|The elevator door opened again.
0:59:42|0:59:47|[Swan] was seen lying on his back, lifted by four bodyguards and carried in.
0:59:48|0:59:51|[Ayo] leans in close to [Baby]'s chest.
0:59:52|0:59:54|Riguo looked around.
1:0:25|1:0:30|[Tom] raised a finger-sized remote control and smiled at Katie with a raised eyebrow.
1:0:30|1:0:35|Watching Katie approach Tom eagerly, Li Shan quickly grabbed her arm.
1:0:56|1:1:3|Watching helplessly as Kan Di, [Tom] turned around and walked towards the floor-to-ceiling window with his arms outstretched.
1:1:25|1:1:31|[Tom], who was originally very excited, immediately became low-spirited.
1:1:36|1:1:42|[Tom] turned around, passed the three people, and then walked into the elevator with a joyful stride.
1:1:50|1:2:1|With long hair tied high behind her head and a slightly cold gaze, [Ayo] commanded the three people in front of her with an unquestionable tone, then led a group of bodyguards away.
1:2:1|1:2:6|According to the agreement, one hour later, Li Shan, Ayo, and Ling Xin drove to the underground parking lot of Hotel A.
1:2:6|1:2:14|Before turning into the parking space, the three of them saw Mei Yi leading a group of bodyguards out of the hotel building, and then standing in front of the car.
1:2:14|1:2:21|[Li Shan] had to step on the brake and walked towards Mei Yi's direction first.
1:2:21|1:2:28|Mei Yi heard Katie's response and turned her head to signal the bodyguard to search the car.
1:2:28|1:2:35|Right Brother, who got off the car right after, widened his eyes in an instant, but being trapped by Tianke, he could only follow orders without making any moves.
1:2:35|1:2:40|So, the two brothers watched helplessly as Katie left the underground parking lot.
1:2:40|1:2:43|Before long, Mei Yi brought Katie, the bodyguards, and others into the house.
1:2:44|1:3:1|Katie looked up to see the entire corridor covered with dark-patterned carpets, with six bodyguards standing on either side. At the end of the corridor, only a small window in the shape of a person was leaking out. Although the sunlight shone in generously, it unexpectedly revealed a strange and chilling appearance.
1:3:1|1:3:10|At the end, turn left. On a larger square wooden platform, [Tom] is watching the screen, playing a game with his back to the crowd.
1:3:11|1:3:16|Katie bypassed the bodyguards sliding everywhere and went straight to [Tom]'s back, asking.
1:3:40|1:3:48|[Tom] threw down the game controller, turned around, and then bounced towards the stairs.
1:3:48|1:3:53|Leaning against the railing of the stairs with both hands, Li Shan looked down at Katie.
1:3:53|1:4:1|Outside the hotel on the street, Li Shan and Ayo heard the words and looked at each other at the same time.
1:4:3|1:4:11|At this moment, the man in the floral shirt, also known as [Li Shan], was kicked in the knee pit by the bodyguard and fell heavily to his knees at [Tom]'s feet.
1:4:11|1:4:16|Shortly after, [Tom] moved his fingers and a bodyguard handed him a transparent pillbox.
1:4:25|1:4:28|Li Shan, who had been breathing rapidly, suddenly stopped when he heard it.
1:4:38|1:4:40|[Tom] looked up, his mouth curved in a brilliant smile as he gazed towards the sea.
1:4:44|1:4:53|[Swan] was held back by the bodyguards and forced to stay in place, only able to watch helplessly as [Tom] gently placed the poison into his own mouth.
1:4:53|1:4:58|I wanted to struggle, but when I looked up, I saw [Baby] pointing a gun at his own forehead.
1:5:8|1:5:18|[Tom], whose emotions were instantly ignited, holding the medicine box in his hand, bounced to the terrace behind him.
1:5:18|1:5:28|Tom reached out with the hand holding the medicine box towards the balcony, glanced at [Ayo] kneeling on the ground, then with a slight movement of his fingers, the medicine box containing the antidote fell down from the 15th floor.
1:5:34|1:5:45|Just as they ran a few steps, [Ayo] was hit on the head by something. When he picked it up and took a look, it turned out to be a medicine box.
1:5:45|1:5:49|Yan Sheng, who had taken poison, intended to take the elevator, but was turned and pushed towards the stairwell by the bodyguard.
1:6:10|1:6:13|Bang! [Tom] sat on the genuine leather sofa on the terrace.
1:6:27|1:6:31|At this moment, [Li Shan] rushes into the hotel lobby and heads straight for the elevator on the first floor.
1:6:39|1:6:46|When the elevator door opened, Yan Shen screamed and rushed out from the nearby stairwell, coming face to face with [Li Shan].
1:6:46|1:6:52|So, [Li Shan] immediately gave up the elevator, opened the door to the stairwell, and ran upstairs.
1:6:52|1:6:59|And at this moment, Katie resolutely walked towards [Tom] and put the poison into his mouth.
1:6:59|1:7:4|At the sight of this, he raised his hand and threw the keys to Katie.
1:7:9|1:7:13|As soon as the words fell, [Li Shan] kicked two bodyguards and rushed in.
1:7:16|1:7:19|Afterwards, Li Shan raised the medicine box to signal to everyone.
1:7:19|1:7:23|On the other side, Li Shan had already run to the outside of the hotel gate.
1:7:26|1:7:31|Brother Li Shan held the medicine box, quietly watching as the headless fly-like figure searched in front of the hotel.
1:7:34|1:7:37|Li Shan held up the medicine box in front of him.
1:7:55|1:8:6|Seeing the sudden intrusion of [Li Shan], [Tom] casually and graciously put down his gun, then waved his hand as if in enjoyment, and instantly, up to 20 well-dressed bodyguards flooded into the room.
1:8:6|1:8:14|[Li Shan] rose from the ground, a kick straight through the shoulder of the guard, followed by punches landing on the faces, necks, and other areas of the crowd like fish.
1:8:16|1:8:22|At this moment, a bodyguard firmly locked his arms from behind, while others quickly rushed towards him to grab his left hand holding the medicine box.
1:8:24|1:8:29|[Li Shan] performed a somersault to evade the front attack, but was immediately lifted up by another bodyguard.
1:8:29|1:8:38|Watching as he was about to be dragged to the top of the long ladder and out the door, [Li Shan] took a deep breath and punched the bodyguard's chest, then opened the medicine box and took the antidote into his mouth.
1:8:38|1:8:43|He then rushed towards Katie and the others in front of the door again.
1:8:43|1:8:46|Raising his hand heavily, [Li Shan] knocks out the bodyguard blocking his way.
1:8:46|1:8:54|Continuing, he grabbed the newcomer's collar, twisted it hard, then quickly bent down, and threw him to the ground with a slam.
1:8:54|1:8:59|In a split second, [Li Shan] lifted his foot and fiercely kicked the shin of a bodyguard on the left side.
1:8:59|1:9:8|Suddenly, a bodyguard sprang out from the side and, catching Li Shan off guard, fiercely grabbed her neck with both arms, signaling the people in front to act quickly.
1:9:8|1:9:12|Unexpectedly, [Li Shan] used the momentum to spring up, lifting his foot straight to the faces of the two bodyguards in front of him.
1:9:14|1:9:21|Then, [Li Shan] raised his elbow and delivered a heavy blow to his own back, causing the bodyguard with a heavy blow to the temple to immediately let go and fall to the ground.
1:9:41|1:9:47|[Ling Xin] stood still for a moment, stunned, and only subconsciously made a swallowing motion upon hearing [Li Shan]'s words.
1:9:47|1:9:52|His eyes flickered as he looked at her, then he pursed his lips and scratched his head.
1:9:52|1:9:56|At this moment, another group of bodyguards heard the commotion and quickly rushed over from outside the main gate.
1:9:56|1:10:2|[Li Shan] naturally took [Ling Xin]'s hand and turned to walk towards the bodyguards.
1:10:7|1:10:19|[Li Shan] stood on the platform of the stairs, glanced at the bodyguards rushing in below, then reached out his left hand to [Ling Xin]. After they high-fived, the two of them stepped on the railing and jumped straight down from the platform.
1:10:19|1:10:22|The bodyguards saw [Ling Xin] shooting with great accuracy, so they rushed straight towards her.
1:10:23|1:10:32|Unexpectedly, he first severely injured the bodyguard's face with a scorpion's white tail, then knocked him down heavily with a white leg in place, and finally squatted down abruptly.
1:10:32|1:10:38|Without waiting for the bodyguards to approach, [Li Shan] swept past with one leg, instantly taking care of two opponents.
1:10:38|1:10:49|[Li Shan] is also adept at various wrestling techniques, even lifting up Katie and using himself as an axis for her to kick forward and backward in mid-air.
1:10:54|1:10:59|[Tom] stood on the terrace, watching the entire process, his fingers curled up excitedly.
1:10:59|1:11:5|[SWAN] nodded gently after listening to the instructions, then turned and left the room.
1:11:5|1:11:11|Katie, already furious, stormed down to the underground parking lot and was immediately stopped by three bodyguards.
1:11:11|1:11:17|But she didn't slow down at all, with a lift of her palm, a swing of her elbow, a kick, she quickly took care of it.
1:11:22|1:11:28|After embracing tightly in the off-road vehicle, Katie and Tianke slammed the door shut and drove away from the hotel.
1:11:28|1:11:35|In the top floor room of the hotel, the group of bodyguards saw that only [Li Shan] was left, so they walked up and surrounded him.
1:11:35|1:11:42|Li Shan was caught off guard and was kicked in the chest by a bodyguard, falling onto the long ladder.
1:11:42|1:11:47|Just as it seemed like they were about to be caught, a loud noise came from behind.
1:11:47|1:11:50|[Li Shan] burst through the door and leaped high, but unfortunately fell to the ground upon landing.
1:11:59|1:12:20|A group of bodyguards hesitated to approach as they saw Ayo aiming the gun back and forth. Li Shan took the opportunity to leave the room, causing Ayo to panic. The next moment, he was overwhelmed by the bodyguards and the gun in his hand was grabbed. In the chaos, he pulled the trigger, and a flame shot out from the muzzle. It turned out to be just a lighter.
1:12:20|1:12:21|Li Shan struggles in the co-pilot seat.
1:12:49|1:12:56|[Tom] played with the remote control of the bomb, sitting in the back seat and looking at the jeep in front of him with a playful expression.
1:12:56|1:13:2|At this moment, the necklace bomb tightly held by [Li Shan] seemed to sense the activation signal, emitting a dangerous sound.
1:13:2|1:13:6|Katie glanced to the side and then angrily stepped on the gas pedal, fiercely turning the steering wheel.
1:13:42|1:13:48|Tom looked at the smiling pig head, raised his hand to touch his lips, and then fearlessly leaned on his chin.
1:13:48|1:13:53|Watching the shadow of the jeep leaving, the eyes gradually became dignified.
1:13:53|1:13:57|Katie, oblivious to what was happening behind her, accelerated away from the city and headed towards a path in the woods.
1:13:58|1:14:1|Kemi suddenly drove up again.
1:14:1|1:14:9|Tianke saw Mei driving closer in the rearview mirror, then suddenly turned the steering wheel and quickly matched the speed of her own jeep.
1:14:9|1:14:16|Then, [Tom] slowly lowered the rear window, raised the remote control in his hand, and turned his head to wave at Katie.
1:14:16|1:14:24|Katie withdrew her gaze and looked up to see a small path blocked by a fence beside the alley. Without hesitation, she abruptly turned the steering wheel to the left.
1:14:26|1:14:30|The speeding car was spun around by the stationary jeep.
1:14:30|1:14:35|When Mei Yi regained consciousness, Katie had already driven the off-road vehicle into the mud.
1:14:35|1:14:38|Shortly after, Katie drove onto another road.
1:14:42|1:14:51|As soon as the words fell, the alarm of the necklace bomb held tightly by Li Shan sounded again, causing Katie's face to change. She had no choice but to step on the accelerator again and speed up towards the crowd.
1:14:51|1:14:58|Tianke unconsciously placed his hand on the necklace bomb and looked at Katie.
1:14:58|1:15:2|Katie bent down and tightly held Tianke's left hand in her own.
1:15:8|1:15:11|Upon hearing Li Shan's response, Katie looked straight ahead.
1:15:11|1:15:17|At the end of the road, [Li Shan] is driving an SUV at high speed towards us.
1:15:17|1:15:26|[Li Shan] confidently said, then handed a small metal tube the size of a mineral water bottle, with a sparkling top, out of the car.
1:15:27|1:15:35|As the two cars passed each other closely, Katie, who also had her hand out of the car, tightly gripped the small tube in her hand.
1:15:35|1:15:42|The handover completed, [Li Shan] breathed a sigh of relief and then, with a determined look in his eyes, continued to drive straight ahead.
1:15:42|1:15:48|Suddenly, [Tom] noticed that the signal pinpointing the exact location of the off-road vehicle disappeared from the screen.
1:15:48|1:15:54|[Li Shan] tightly gripped the steering wheel, yanked the handbrake down, then made a sudden left turn, four wisps of smoke billowing up from behind the tires.
1:15:55|1:16:2|[Tom] gave the order without hesitation, and Mei Yi had no choice but to step on the gas pedal and crash into the car blocking the road.
1:16:2|1:16:13|[Li Shan] showed no fear at all, just tightened the seatbelt with his hand, watching the other party rushing straight towards him, accompanied by the sound of metal scraping and steel frame tearing.
1:16:13|1:16:18|Li Shan's SUV was directly lifted into the sky, rolling over repeatedly before crashing heavily onto the road surface.
1:16:21|1:16:25|Mei Yi and [Tom]’s heads slammed heavily into the deployed airbags.
1:16:25|1:16:34|After a moment of daze, [Tom] first looked back at the severely damaged ICUV that was hit, then turned to the front, searching for the traces of the off-road vehicle.
1:16:34|1:16:41|Seeing the off-road vehicle about to disappear at the end of the road, he raised the remote control high, pushed the door open, and hurriedly chased after it.
1:16:41|1:16:44|It is not clear whether the remote control malfunctioned due to the car crash.
1:16:45|1:16:50|[Tom] pressed the button three or four times but there was no explosion, causing him to panic.
1:16:50|1:16:57|Until the explosion sounded, a hot mushroom cloud bloomed on the horizon, and only then did [Li Shan] reveal a smile.
1:16:57|1:17:2|Shortly after, Mei drove away in a sedan with the front end already scrapped, carrying [Tom].
1:17:2|1:17:8|Two figures supporting each other hurriedly emerged from the trees on the side of the road until the tail lights were no longer visible.
1:17:8|1:17:13|[Tom] changed into a brand new suit and walked up to the arcade machine.
1:18:21|1:18:28|The hotel chairman, who was tied to a chair, couldn't help but tremble, and then heard Tom whispering in his ear.
1:18:28|1:18:33|In the hotel suite on the other side, Miss [Ling Xin].
1:18:42|1:18:44|Just as [SWAN] and the others were regretting, [Tom] was already making plans.
1:19:4|1:19:10|The bodyguards in suits and leather shoes were seen carrying a heavy aluminum alloy box out of the top floor of the hotel.
1:19:10|1:19:20|Under each instruction, Li Shan first went to the wind power station by the sea, then mobilized the convoy, and arrived at a power control panel with tangled cables.
1:19:20|1:19:30|The destination may be different, but the boxes in the hands of each bodyguard are surprisingly consistent, while [Tom] sits on the top floor of the hotel, leisurely holding the controller and playing games.
1:19:43|1:19:48|Tian Ke quickly opened the laptop and searched the hotel's main server on the keyboard.
1:19:55|1:20:3|Just as [SWAN] was puzzled, [Ayo] sitting next to Tianke took out his phone to check, then turned back to look at Jingjian.
1:20:26|1:20:31|At this moment, the bruised [Li Shan] and Ayo walked out of the elevator.
1:20:31|1:20:33|The reunited five people smiled at each other, then [Swan] spoke.
1:20:52|1:20:58|Welcome just landed, [Baby] supported himself with one hand on the back of the sofa, then leaped up and jumped in front of [SWAN].
1:20:58|1:21:6|After a series of kicks and punches, she landed a left punch on her waist, followed by a right punch straight towards the floor-to-ceiling window, causing the curtains in front of the window to once again react and open.
1:21:6|1:21:14|The sunlight streamed into the room, and the five of them gazed at the scenery where the sea and sky met in the distance, then all turned to look at A Hotel diagonally ahead.
1:21:18|1:21:26|[Li Shan] and Katie changed into couple outfits, pretending to be a couple checking in at the front desk of Hotel A, only to hear the front desk inviting them to attend tonight's lantern festival.
1:21:26|1:21:33|While [Ayo] and [Swan] disguised themselves as baggage handlers, they kept a moderate distance from [Li Shan] Katie.
1:21:33|1:21:38|Tianke stayed in the suite, manipulating the intricately complex remote computer in front of him.
1:21:38|1:21:42|At this moment, [Li Shan] and the others have dragged their suitcases into the elevator.
1:21:51|1:21:56|In the meantime, Li Shan, Katie, and Ayo have finished exchanging blows with their weapons.
1:22:7|1:22:14|Tianke pressed the button, causing a short circuit that turned off the lights on the top floor of Hotel A.
1:22:14|1:22:22|Tom's bodyguard shouted out, at this moment, the head bodyguard realized something was wrong, so he immediately ordered his men to retreat from the top floor stairs.
1:22:22|1:22:27|Shortly after, [Li Shan], [Ayo], and [Ling Xin] walked out of the elevator.
1:22:32|1:22:40|Three figures stepped lightly into the room, then turned on the flashlight and walked up the long ladder in the center of the room based on their previous memory.
1:22:40|1:22:44|Descending the long ladder, Li Shan, Ayo, and Ling Xin split up and search for the target bomb.
1:22:44|1:22:50|[Ayo] searches the bar counter, [Ling Xin] searches the flower bed, while [Katie] is lighting up in the center of the house.
1:22:50|1:22:59|At this moment, [Ayo] swept the lights and suddenly noticed two suitcases on the pool table not far from the bar, with thumb-sized liquid bombs hidden inside.
1:23:6|1:23:15|Just as the three of them were shining flashlights around the pool table, the room suddenly lit up.
1:23:15|1:23:23|In the suite, Mei Yi holds a gun to [Swan]'s head.
1:23:23|1:23:29|Taking advantage of Mei Yi turning her head, [SWAN] quickly hid the jamming device hanging around her neck into her collar while giving orders into the walkie-talkie.
1:23:33|1:23:43|The three quickly returned to the pool table, only to find that as soon as they picked up the box filled with bombs and walked down the steps, they saw the group of bodyguards coming back and forth.
1:23:43|1:23:50|In this scene, the bodyguard Li Shan didn't hesitate to shoot, so the three of them had to bend down and quickly run into the bar to take cover.
1:23:50|1:23:55|[Li Shan] was about to rush out, but [Katie] grabbed her arm and then glanced at [Ayo].
1:23:57|1:24:7|Katie looked [Ayo] up and down, then pushed him out. The bodyguard lectured him, then started shooting at him wildly again.
1:24:7|1:24:13|Who knew [Ayo] didn't dodge at all, pulling up the collar of his windbreaker and wrapping it around his head, standing tall like a ram with his back to the bodyguard.
1:24:23|1:24:40|Taking advantage of the distraction, Katie pulled out a stun gun and ambushed from the side, successfully taking out two of the bodyguards. Then, [Li Shan] suddenly attacked from the flank, swinging a collapsible baton at the opponent, and finally delivered a shock, temporarily clearing out the guards inside the house.
1:24:40|1:24:53|Li Shan, Ayo, and Ling Xin hurried towards the elevator. As they passed by a bodyguard who was less than 1.5 meters tall, they ignored him and continued on. Little did they know, the bodyguard picked up two submachine guns and started firing wildly in the direction the three were leaving.
1:24:53|1:24:59|Fortunately, [Ayo] quickly opened the bulletproof windbreaker, hurriedly protecting [Li Shan] and Katie as they ran towards the elevator.
1:24:59|1:25:0|[Baby] opens the elevator door at this moment.
1:25:4|1:25:10|Li Shan and Ayo took the box full of bombs from Katie's hands, and Baby turned to look down the corridor.
1:25:10|1:25:20|At this point, the short man's submachine gun has run out of bullets. Before [Li Shan] charges into the elevator, two bodyguards come running from the side staircase and manage to grab [Li Shan]'s clothes as they dive.
1:25:21|1:25:36|Unlucky [Ayo] happened to be knocked down right in front of the elevator door crack, the other bodyguards pressed down one after another. Seeing the elevator door not closing, [Li Shan] suddenly swung open the expandable baton. [Ayo] looked up at him, then obediently lowered his head.
1:25:36|1:25:41|Next, [Li Shan] opened the elevator control box, and the group of bodyguards were instantly subdued.
1:25:43|1:25:50|Watching as [Katie] and the others successfully ran onto the rooftop, [Baby] forcefully wedged herself into the door frame, blocking the bodyguards who were trying to chase after them.
1:25:50|1:25:53|With a swift turn, [Li Shan] knocked down all ten bodyguards with a single punch.
1:25:54|1:26:2|While the bodyguard was catching his breath, [Li Shan] directly closed the door to the rooftop.
1:26:2|1:26:6|[Baby] tightly grasped the handrails with both hands, as if hearing a faint sound unintentionally.
1:26:9|1:26:11|At this moment, [Li Shan] realized.
1:26:12|1:26:15|[Ayo] heard this and looked at the two boxes at his feet.
1:26:20|1:26:28|[Ayo], who had already swung his arm and leaned half of his body out of the balcony, quickly hit the brakes and managed to pull back the two boxes in his hands back onto the rooftop.
1:26:28|1:26:34|And on the rooftop below, a large group of guests holding wine glasses were mingling in a mix of joy and sorrow.
1:26:34|1:26:40|[Ayo] sighed with lingering fear, only to be startled by the sound of an explosion next second.
1:26:40|1:26:42|The next moment, everyone saw the lights in front of them go out.
1:26:43|1:26:52|In the distance, the brightly lit buildings by the seaside suddenly exploded with flames, followed by a surge of intense fireballs from the connected buildings.
1:26:52|1:27:4|Following that, the device that was originally generating electricity with maple leaves also emitted a deafening roar. The shattered leaves fell like shooting stars, plunging the entire city into darkness in an instant.
1:27:12|1:27:17|Tom came to the suite, took off the Tianke transmitter, stuck it behind his ear, stood in front of the floor-to-ceiling window, and admired the fireworks blooming in the night.
1:27:36|1:27:47|Afterwards, Li Shan took out a remote control from his suit pocket, suddenly saw himself as a conductor, gestured towards Ayo Hotel, and then gently pressed the button.
1:27:47|1:27:56|Behind him, Li Shan and Ayo, who were tied to the sofa, couldn't bear to witness it and quickly closed their eyes.
1:28:2|1:28:7|[Li Shan] tightly held onto Katie with one hand and removed the transmitter with the other.
1:28:7|1:28:10|The other three quickly removed their blockers as well.
1:28:10|1:28:13|[Tom] holds his head in his hands, his face contorted in agony.
1:28:13|1:28:18|[Ayo] looks towards the box not far away.
1:28:38|1:28:42|[Baby] heard the instructions and angrily kicked the door of the hall, then, three people rushed out.
1:28:51|1:28:56|The three of them wasted no time and, after snatching back the RV from the underground parking lot, headed straight for the location of [Swan].
1:28:56|1:29:0|The news of the RV escape quickly reached Ayo's ears.
1:29:0|1:29:4|She frowned, glanced at [Tom], and quickly left the room.
1:29:4|1:29:6|At this moment, the scene extends to [the rooftop].
1:29:13|1:29:25|As soon as the words fell, [Yan Shen] gestured for [Ayo] to look towards the rooftop gate, where a group of thugs with sticks and toolboxes rushed out from the gate. [Ayo] looked pleased at the crowd and then nodded in approval.
1:29:25|1:29:36|On the other side, upon receiving the message, [Swan] had already arrived at the entrance of the hotel. Upon seeing the RV of [Li Shan] and the others, she quickly raised her assault rifle and shot towards them, causing the vehicle to crash by the roadside in the chaos.
1:29:37|1:29:49|[On the rooftop], after [Yan Shen] distributed the paper covers to everyone, he turned around and squatted in front of [Ayo], watching him carefully suspend the liquid bombs in the center of the paper covers.
1:29:49|1:29:54|[Ayo] quickly aimed the gun at the forced-stopped RV again after reloading.
1:29:54|1:30:5|[Li Shan] quickly suggested that, coincidentally, [Ayo]'s gun jammed.
1:30:7|1:30:16|Then, [Katie] took the opportunity to jump off the RV with [the baby], using the chaos caused by the RV hitting the cars on the street as cover, and ran straight towards the direction inside the hotel.
1:30:16|1:30:26|Downstairs, [Ayo] was bending down to change the magazine, but as she looked up, she felt a sudden gust of cold wind and saw [Li Shan] performing a swift dragon tail kick, knocking the submachine gun out of her hand.
1:30:29|1:30:48|Tom finally found the problem, yanking the jammer from Li Shan's neck and fiercely stomping on it with the heel of his shoe. Then he picked up the remote control and walked back to the floor-to-ceiling window.
1:30:48|1:30:56|While Tom closed his eyes and raised his hands to play in a trance, Katie loaded the bullet, firmly aiming at Tom's back.
1:30:57|1:31:0|[Katie] pulled the trigger, but [Tom] dodged swiftly.
1:31:21|1:31:29|At this moment, with no one blocking her path, [Li Shan] stood still in shock after another gunshot, and [Ayo] seized the opportunity to ride forward.
1:31:29|1:31:39|Li Shan is still not as tall and long-legged as Ayo. Just as Li Shan leaped onto the street-side landscape, he turned around and delivered a high kick, landing directly on Swan's head.
1:31:39|1:31:44|On the rooftop of A Hotel, the thugs carefully lit the alcohol candles and placed them under the paper lanterns.
1:31:45|1:31:48|The heat rises, and the paper cover in the center instantly expands.
1:31:48|1:31:54|Next, small sky lanterns were seen drifting towards the pitch-black sky.
1:31:54|1:32:0|A group of tourists looked up at the dazzling beauty in the dark night, unable to help but be amazed.
1:32:0|1:32:9|On the contrary, [Li Shan] arrived at the suite panting heavily, only to find Katie shot in the leg, leaning against the edge of the sofa, heaved a sigh of relief.
1:32:9|1:32:12|Glancing sideways, [Tom] aimed the gun at himself.
1:32:25|1:32:29|[Tom] swung his pistol in hand, his face contorted in a grimace as he spoke.
1:32:37|1:32:43|[Li Shan] shouted to stop, but the next second, seeing the scene outside the window, he instantly froze in his tracks.
1:32:43|1:32:53|The rising sky lantern in the dark night, exploded instantly in the high sky tens of meters away after [Tom] pressed the remote control button, like a fairy scattering flowers, illuminating the night as bright as day.
1:32:54|1:33:8|The joyful smiles of the tourists below gradually became clearer in the exploding flames. Unaware of the truth, they might think it's just a surprise and won't know they just narrowly escaped death.
1:33:8|1:33:16|At this moment, numerous sky lanterns are rising and exploding one after another. In the moment of explosion, the bright shards scatter like crystals, painting the dark night in a colorful way.
1:33:19|1:33:35|Katie, who took in everything with her eyes, looked at the gorgeous scenery outside the floor-to-ceiling windows. Xuanzhi's heart finally settled down. The original sound on the rooftop and the excited shouts of the thugs made everyone cheer for success, embracing each other as if they had survived a disaster.
1:33:35|1:33:40|At this moment, [Tom] suddenly realized something was wrong and turned to look out the floor-to-ceiling window.
1:33:40|1:33:52|He didn't see the scene of buildings being destroyed and people fleeing as expected. In anger, he immediately turned back and smashed the remote control.
1:33:52|1:33:55|Tom aimed his gun at [Li Shan], then raised the antidote box high.
1:34:7|1:34:14|Tom stumbled backwards, knocking the steps in front of the French window and falling back. The antidote in his hand slipped out of the window in an instant.
1:34:14|1:34:21|[Li Shan] got up and lunged forward, barely catching the medicine box, but the next second, he fell out directly due to inertia.
1:34:21|1:34:33|At the moment the first shot was fired, he tightly gripped the windowsill with his right hand, while Tom got up and patted his suit, playfully walking towards the window. He then raised one foot and ruthlessly kicked [Li Shan]'s hand.
1:34:33|1:34:39|A shot hit Li Shan's hand, and after seeing Li Shan fall, he grabbed onto the railing outside the building.
1:34:39|1:34:41|This time, he aimed at the top of [Li Shan]'s head.
1:34:44|1:34:48|Li Shan looked at the struggling [Ayo] without hands, gazing at the roaring sea beneath her.
1:34:48|1:34:51|Tom is about to shoot, ending it all.
1:34:51|1:34:57|At this moment, [Baby] forcefully shields the gunshot wound in his abdomen, suddenly pouncing from behind and grabbing onto Tom's arms.
1:34:57|1:35:3|Taking advantage of the two above being entangled, [Li Shan] used one hand to open the medicine box and put the antidote into his own mouth.
1:35:3|1:35:10|Grabbing the handle tightly with both hands, exerting force with the waist and abdomen, grabbing the windowsill fiercely, then flipping back into the room and quickly approaching the two.
1:35:11|1:35:21|A leg kicked out from the airship, hitting [Tom] on the neck and knocking him over, saving [Baby] from the barrel of [Tom].
1:35:21|1:35:31|[Li Shan] knelt on one knee, panting heavily, gave a slight smile to the unconscious [Tom], then turned to look at Katie, but Katie's face suddenly changed.
1:35:34|1:35:43|When [Tom] once again aimed his gun at [Li Shan], [SWAN] and [Ayo] both took action with a box and a stun gun.
1:35:43|1:35:49|However, before [SWAN] could make a move, [Tom] was shot by [Ayo], and under the strong electric current, he finally passed out.
1:35:58|1:36:10|At this moment, [Li Shan] finally realized what was happening. He took a sip of the antidote, stood up straight, and walked towards Katie with a smile on his face. He squatted down in front of Katie, gently held her face in his hands, and leaned in close.
1:36:15|1:36:17|[Li Shan] immediately lowered his arms.
1:36:17|1:36:21|Behind, Li Shan has already crawled over.
1:36:21|1:36:32|[Li Shan] kept his lips tightly closed and looked at Katie again.
1:36:32|1:36:40|Seeing that [Li Shan] showed no intention of rescuing anyone, [Ayo] simply threw herself on top of her, then aggressively moved her head towards her lips.
1:36:54|1:36:58|In the early morning, Li Shan, Ayo, and Ling Xin were curled up on the sofa in the suite, mumbling in their sleep.
1:37:9|1:37:14|Learning that those children who lost their families have all been sent to the orphanage.
1:37:19|1:37:25|[Li Shan] and Katie sat back to the sunrise, looking out the floor-to-ceiling window and chatting with the three of them.
1:37:25|1:37:32|Katie put down the cup in her hand and lowered her head shyly.
1:37:32|1:37:34|After speaking, he turned his head to look at [Li Shan].
1:38:10|1:38:17|It turns out it was [Baby], and she recalled the scene that left a deep impression on her, even in her dreams she still couldn't forget.
1:38:17|1:38:23|At the same time, she clutched the pillow tightly to her chest, looking like she was about to burst into tears.
1:38:23|1:38:33|Sitting on the floor in front of them, the two of them paid no attention. Katie instinctively hugged Li Shan's waist, and Li Shan tightly held her in his arms, closing his eyes to deepen the kiss.
1:38:34|1:38:37|Time passes, the vast Arctic snowfield stretches as far as the eye can see.
1:38:37|1:38:40|Snow and ice seemed to fall from the sky, standing in front of them.
1:38:40|1:38:43|[Li Shan] and the other four people are lying on the ice.
1:39:37|1:39:41|The film ends here and we have to say goodbye to you. Thank you for listening.
1:39:41|1:39:44|At the end of the film, a post-credits scene will be shown.
1:44:49|1:44:52|Now I will tell you about the post-credits scene.
1:44:52|1:45:1|A slamming sound is heard as Tom, now in prison uniform, raises his name and ID tag in front of the camera to have his mugshot taken.
1:45:1|1:45:10|His expressionless face had lost its previous elegance, with stubble growing on his once smooth face, cheekbones slightly protruding, and a sinister look in his eyes staring into the camera.
1:45:10|1:45:15|The next moment, a hint of smile unexpectedly flowed from the corner of the eyes, and the corners of the lips gradually turned upwards.
1:45:18|1:45:20|At this moment, the lights suddenly dimmed.
