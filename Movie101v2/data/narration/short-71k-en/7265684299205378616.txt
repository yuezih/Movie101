0:0:38|0:0:41|On a remote country road, a bus speeds by.
0:0:45|0:1:0|Please don't hesitate to like, subscribe, share, and support the "Bright Mirror" and "Dots" programs.
0:1:22|0:1:28|Accompanied by cheerful music, the bus carrying the girls who came to work from the city drives through the tunnel.
0:1:28|0:1:42|The small road, lined with rice fields on both sides, stretches towards the countryside, and the buildings not far away gradually transition from tall buildings in the city to unique rural houses.
0:1:42|0:1:43|The road in the village is getting bumpier.
0:2:20|0:2:28|[Sung Daxiong] put down his phone, turned around and looked at the girls who were still immersed in the excitement, and loudly introduced them.
0:2:40|0:2:46|[Sung Daxiong] finished speaking, swaying happily in his seat to the music.
0:2:46|0:2:52|The friend who had just asked the question immediately deflated upon hearing it, and stood expressionless, heavily leaning against the backrest.
0:2:52|0:2:55|The bus drove around the winding mountain road, passing by a grove and a pond.
0:3:35|0:3:39|Accompanied by the girls' laughter and playfulness, the bus was getting closer and closer to its destination.
0:3:39|0:3:47|He didn't stay quiet for long, only to see the bus suddenly brake, a girl holding a silver rod not holding it steady, and water spilled out a lot.
0:3:47|0:3:54|The culprit of all this is a wooden barrel leisurely riding on a cow, slowly passing by in front of the bus.
0:4:31|0:4:49|After a long time, the bus finally arrived at the destination, swiftly passing through the village entrance with a banner hanging above. It read "Wushan Nest, where civilization, stone flowers, and wine fragrance drift." Driving further in, as the bus approached, the children playing at the village entrance spontaneously lined up into two rows to make way for the bus, then playfully chased after the departing bus.
0:4:52|0:4:59|After a long journey, the group finally arrived at the village. The girls carried their suitcases and walked unsteadily to the open space in the village.
0:4:59|0:5:8|At this moment, many villagers have gathered here, each one scrutinizing and sizing up these stylish city girls.
0:5:8|0:5:14|The girls are wearing tight jeans and cropped tops, completely different from the village women in loose shirts.
0:5:34|0:5:40|The girls who were shouting to go to the bathroom were stunned by [Song Daxiong] in a chrome jacket, and they all walked back again.
0:6:9|0:6:15|In the village committee, a middle-aged man with a thick beard is carefully weighing the neatly arranged tea leaves on the table.
0:6:15|0:6:19|He carefully picked up a pinch of tea leaves and savored them in his mouth.
0:6:19|0:6:25|As he picked up the hot water kettle to prepare a cup of hot tea, a middle-aged man wearing glasses rushed in anxiously.
0:6:31|0:6:35|The village chief was startled, hot boiling water spilled on his hand, and the teacup fell to the ground.
0:6:51|0:7:0|On the vast edge of Changyuan, [Song Daxiong] on the co-pilot of the bus was writing the words "sprout tea" on a blackboard.
0:7:0|0:7:4|His surroundings were filled with nosy villagers and city girls who came for the training.
0:8:1|0:8:5|The girls dispersed in a commotion, eagerly pushing open the dormitory door.
0:8:5|0:8:10|You disrupted the dormitory with your words, causing a commotion while assigning beds.
0:8:10|0:8:14|The girl holding the fish tank almost got into a fight with the girl holding the cat.
0:8:14|0:8:19|The plain room was quickly adorned with stylish posters and small animal decorations by the girls, making it warm and cozy.
0:8:20|0:8:28|The one leading them in, [Luo Minying], stood at the door awkwardly stirring the clothes with his hands, watching their smooth movements in a daze.
0:8:40|0:8:48|Luo Mingying was stunned by this question, and the noisy girls instantly quieted down, turning their heads together to look at [Zhang Lilei] who asked the question.
0:8:48|0:8:53|[Zhang Lilei] didn't expect this kind of ending either, innocently pouted and didn't say anything more.
0:8:53|0:9:3|After the girls finished packing up, they returned to the previous open space and lined up to receive the tea-picking baskets and aprons from Luo Mingying and [Song Daxiong].
0:9:15|0:9:19|The girls followed the villagers to the tea garden with [Song Daxiong].
0:9:19|0:9:21|Both sides of the road in the tea plantation are lined with flags.
0:9:21|0:9:29|On a high platform, two children, a boy and a girl, are dressed in rattan costumes performing tea art at a table with a stove.
0:9:29|0:9:37|High toss, turn around, catch the teapot, bend down, pour water, a copper teapot with a spout about one meter long in their hands seems to come to life.
0:9:38|0:9:44|As they moved, the drama flowed down with their actions, but landed steadily into the cup.
0:9:44|0:9:56|The audience below widened their eyes in astonishment at their superb skills. After the tea ceremony performance, [Song Daxiong] and his sister Xiaojuan walked up to the stage with their mother holding a tray.
0:9:56|0:10:0|The tray was covered with a luxurious cloth, making it impossible to see what was inside.
0:10:0|0:10:4|After they stepped onto the stage, [Song Daxiong] slowly lifted the cloth.
0:10:4|0:10:8|Inside, there was a set of glass tea ware and a full canister of tea leaves.
0:10:18|0:10:44|After Luo Mingying finished explaining, the girls from the town who were gathered around him whispered to each other, with smiles on their faces, craning their necks to look towards the stage.
0:10:46|0:10:53|On stage, [Zhang Lilei] carefully poured the boiling water he had just boiled into the teapot with the tea leaves.
0:10:53|0:11:1|The soft tea leaves, with the infusion of boiling water, seemed to come to life as they danced in the teapot, each leaf standing upright without falling over.
0:11:2|0:11:14|[Sung Daxiong] covered the teapot, poured the tea into the cup on the side, raised the tea cup high towards the nearby stone tablet, and then respectfully walked to the altar with the incense burner holding the tea cup.
0:11:14|0:11:18|He raised the tea cup to his brow and bowed deeply towards the stone tablet.
0:11:20|0:11:23|The audience below the stage looked curiously at his mysterious ritual.
0:11:23|0:11:28|He set down the teacup, clasped his hands together, and bowed reverently towards the stone tablet.
0:11:28|0:11:30|The ceremony was finally considered officially over.
0:13:14|0:13:17|The manager [Zhang Lilei] glided along the tender shoots of the tea tree.
0:13:41|0:13:45|The fresh scent of the tea tree tempted [Zhang Lilei] to take a sniff.
0:13:45|0:13:49|[Luo Mingying] followed her movements and picked a tender shoot to introduce to the girls.
0:14:10|0:14:25|[Lumingying] had just finished introducing the girls, and they immediately started working vigorously. They danced and ran, dispersing like a group of butterflies in the vast tea plantation, as if they had inexhaustible energy. The fatigue from the morning's journey from the city had all disappeared.
0:14:28|0:14:38|On the other side of the field, there were five or six little boys squatting on the terraced fields like little monkeys, curiously staring at the female workers who came from the city, and even singing some vulgar nursery rhymes.
0:14:38|0:14:42|The girls, however, paid no attention and waved their hands to drive away the mischievous children.
0:14:42|0:14:50|Compared to the skilled tea-picking movements of [Zhang Lilei], the girls were still somewhat inexperienced, with some even picking chaotically without care.
0:14:50|0:14:55|They clumsily imitated the elegant manner, some even making phone calls while picking tea leaves.
0:15:23|0:15:31|A pair of delicate and smooth hands fluttering on the tea tree, the skilled [Luo Mingying]'s tea picking movements are extremely beautiful, just like playing the piano.
0:15:31|0:15:43|Other girls were a bit slow, some didn't know what kind of tea to pick and just picked randomly, while others picked one and carefully compared it in front of them. But everyone was enthusiastically doing their work.
0:15:44|0:15:49|Outside the tea plantation, [Song Daxiong] is looking at [Zhang Lilei] who just led the girls to sign the contract.
0:15:49|0:15:59|[Zhang Lilei] noticed his gaze, looked up at him, [Song Daxiong] immediately smiled at him, but [Zhang Lilei] did not appreciate it, she lowered her head expressionlessly and continued picking tea leaves.
0:15:59|0:16:5|On the side, Lu Mingying noticed everything and looked thoughtfully at [Zhang Lilei].
0:16:5|0:16:12|The moonlight was bright, after a long day of work, the girls finally returned to the dormitory, one by one collapsing on the bed, complaining.
0:17:36|0:17:48|The scene shifts, hot water gushes from the shower head in the bathroom, a girl slowly takes off her stockings, dragging her weary body towards the shower room, occasionally singing a few lines along with her movements.
0:18:24|0:18:33|The girls in the jade room chatted and laughed, but looking out the window, there were a few unfriendly faces, craning their necks to peer inside the scene in the jade room.
0:18:35|0:18:48|The village chief, holding a flashlight, passed by and discovered the group of boys peeking from the trees. He looked puzzled and shouted at them.
0:18:48|0:18:56|The village chief followed their direction and found himself facing the window of the women's bathhouse, feeling somewhat embarrassed.
0:18:56|0:19:0|He held a flashlight and caught two kids peeking in the trees.
0:19:8|0:19:28|After the child climbed down from the tree, the village chief covered his eyes and ran away. In the next scene, Zhang Lilei handed a cloth bundle to his mother, "Mom, this is the first batch of sprouting tea this year, I have roasted it." You keep it. Zhang Lilei's mother took out an empty tea canister from the depths of the cabinet, solemnly accepted the cloth bundle, placed the tea leaves to her nose, and carefully savored the hard-earned fragrance.
0:19:28|0:19:35|After pinching another handful of tea leaves and crushing them finely in her hand, [Zhang Lilei] poured the tea leaves into the pot only after confirming everything was correct.
0:21:42|0:21:48|Luo Mingying followed behind [Song Daxiong] and then continued speaking after a while.
0:21:48|0:21:49|Zhang Lilei stops [Song Daxiong] from continuing.
0:21:49|0:22:3|Luo Mingying continued to ask, and [Song Daxiong] turned his head to look at Luo Mingying. The two walked forward in silence, quietly pushed open the wooden door of the venue, and slowly walked towards their destination.
0:22:3|0:22:9|The next day, at dawn, all the female workers who had said they were quitting last night were ready and waiting, and they all arrived at the tea plantation without exception.
0:22:37|0:22:43|[Zhang Lilei] finished the fight with her friend before turning around to ask Xiao Juan, who was standing behind Luo Mingying, picking tea leaves.
0:22:51|0:22:54|[Zhang Lilei] was also startled and jumped into the aisle all of a sudden.
0:22:54|0:23:0|When the girls were running around in panic, the village chief arrived at the tea plantation with the photographer.
0:23:0|0:23:1|Next to him, [Zhang Lilei] introduced.
0:24:32|0:24:38|Late at night, the [Song Daxiong] family watched a clip of the journalist interviewing [Zhang Lilei] in the tea garden during the day.
0:25:0|0:25:8|Song Daxiong paid no attention to the quarrel between his mother and sister, but instead stared straight at Zhang Lilei talking confidently on the television.
0:25:8|0:25:15|In the women's bathhouse at this moment, a girl glanced at the sophisticated Zhang Lilei, smirked, and winked at the girl next to her.
0:25:32|0:25:35|The girls, in the midst of their playfulness, did not notice the commotion outside the window.
0:25:35|0:25:40|The sound of the boys struggling to climb the tree was extremely loud in the night.
0:25:40|0:25:44|The night grew deeper, in the home of [Song Daxiong], the Song family of three discussed the female workers.
0:25:59|0:26:3|Song Mu looked at their hurried figures and then turned to Zhang Lilei.
0:26:4|0:26:10|In the office of the tea factory, [Song Daxiong] and the village chief solemnly scrutinize the two little boys standing in front of them, bowing their heads in silence.
0:26:10|0:26:18|Two little boys stood in front of [Song Daxiong] and the village chief, both with their heads down, eyes cast downward, with torn collars and pants.
0:27:4|0:27:10|[Sung Daxiong] anxiously pinched his temples, burying his face in his hands, trying to come up with a solution.
0:27:24|0:27:28|The two little boys did not move, but instead looked towards [Zhang Lilei].
0:27:28|0:27:35|[Sung Daxiong] stood up and escorted them out of the office, reminding them as he stood behind them.
0:27:35|0:27:39|The two boys had barely taken a few steps out of the room when they encountered the girls who had just finished washing up.
0:27:39|0:27:46|They stopped in their tracks as soon as they saw the girls, staring blankly at their backs as the girls murmured softly.
0:27:49|0:27:55|[Songsong] also walked out of the office and came to the village chief helplessly.
0:28:20|0:28:24|The next morning, Zhang Lilei was busy building a wall outside the bathroom.
0:28:24|0:28:28|The girls who came to wash up were looking around under the steps.
0:28:39|0:28:43|After everything was tidied up, the girls arrived at the tea garden and began a day of work.
0:28:44|0:28:54|Luo Mingying, who used to arrive the earliest, came late this time. She was no longer dressed in a plain style with a long coat and pants, but instead wore a fashionable tight skirt with a shirt.
0:29:12|0:29:23|Lu Mingying, feeling a bit embarrassed by the praise, tugged at the hem of her shirt and smiled as she picked up the tea leaves. [Zhang Lilei] quickly walked over to [Zhang Lilei]'s side with a friendly gesture.
0:30:16|0:30:24|[Zhang Lilei] blushed a little when she heard the praise, tugged at the hem of her shirt, and with a smile picked up the tea leaves, prompting Youqing to quickly walk over to [Zhang Lilei].
0:30:24|0:30:30|Luo Mingying pulled up his sleeves and moved the tea basket to a different position, while Zhang Lilei and her friends continued to pick tea on their own.
0:30:33|0:30:44|A moment later, [Zhang Lilei] glanced around at the female workers, quickly tucking the hem of her shirt into her skirt before continuing to work once she confirmed that her skirt was fine.
0:30:44|0:30:55|Before long, she arrived at a deserted corner with a basket in hand. After looking around to make sure no one was there, she pulled out the clothes she had neatly folded from her skirt and then returned to the tea-picking team.
0:30:55|0:31:0|As the sun sets in the west, it's time to harvest the tea leaves. Luo Mingying lit a fire and burned the tea leaves piled on the ground.
0:31:50|0:31:56|The girls behind all squatted down to check the leaves, and one girl at the end struggled to support her waist as she squatted down.
0:33:3|0:33:15|The girl from the countryside discovered that [Song Daxiong] was standing right behind her. She was so startled that she fled without even taking the monument. Accidentally knocked over, the monument revealed a small cat, so the girl had to go back, pick up the monument, and leave.
0:33:15|0:33:28|As the sun rises, the tea plantation welcomes a new day. The girls gather on the rooftop in twos and threes, washing clothes. [Zhang Lilei] is holding clean clothes, getting ready to hang them out to dry, while an older woman next to her looks at the underwear in her hands.
0:33:31|0:33:35|[Zhang Lilei] finished speaking, picked up the washbasin, and walked towards an empty spot.
0:33:35|0:33:37|The older sister quickly stepped forward to start a conversation.
0:33:51|0:33:54|The eldest sister looked curiously in the direction of [Zhang Lilei].
0:33:54|0:34:6|Before long, [Zhang Lilei] walked towards the elder sister holding a jar of facial mask.
0:34:6|0:34:10|After the eldest sister finished expressing her gratitude, she took the noodles and walked away with a washbasin.
0:34:10|0:34:14|[Zhang Lilei] gave a faint smile and continued to hang up the clothes she had washed.
0:34:14|0:34:19|Xiaojuan hurried over with heavy steps, breaking the morning tranquility.
0:34:26|0:34:32|[Zhang Lilei] looked down at Xiao Juan for a long time without coming back to her senses, furrowing her brows in confusion.
0:34:32|0:34:44|Before long, the female workers gathered outside the tea plantation. Standing in front of them were [Song Daxiong] and Luo Mingying, holding the contract. The two sides looked at each other in silence.
0:35:30|0:35:38|[Sung Daxiong]'s mother finished speaking and turned to leave. Xiao Juan and Luo Mingying quickly caught up, leaving [Sung Daxiong] and the girls to continue their confrontation.
0:35:53|0:36:22|Of course, there is another way. You can negotiate with them and offer some overtime pay. [Zhang Lilei] didn't respond, silently turned and left. If they were willing, they should have been busy picking tea leaves during the harvest season. However, the tea garden was empty at this moment. It was the first time it had been so quiet since the girls arrived. Accustomed to the hustle and bustle of the past, it felt a bit strange at this moment. In the courtyard of [Zhang Lilei]'s house, his mother was feeding the pigs while pulling grass.
0:36:35|0:36:38|Xiao Juan and Luo Mingying exchanged a smile.
0:36:38|0:36:56|Meanwhile, in the office, [Song Daxiong] sat in front of the computer, skillfully typing on the keyboard. In front of the keyboard lay an open labor contract. He clumsily operated the computer, taking a long time to find the labor law that those girls had mentioned. With his left hand supporting his chin, he leaned on the desk and pondered.
0:36:56|0:36:58|[Zhang Lilei] is staring at the computer screen intently.
0:36:58|0:37:7|At the same time, in the elder sister's home who received the facial mask from Zhang Lilei in the morning, the elder sister was applying the mask in front of the mirror. After she finished speaking, she turned and left.
0:37:7|0:37:9|The eldest sister turned around abruptly, glaring at her figure.
0:37:10|0:37:16|In the early morning sun, in the women's dormitory, Zhang Lilei had already changed into her home clothes and lazily leaned against the bed.
0:37:16|0:37:21|[Zhang Lilei] was all set and walked up to her with a backpack on her back.
0:37:28|0:37:30|[Zhang Lilei] had to go out alone.
0:37:30|0:37:32|On the village road, the uncle on the motorcycle takes care of her.
0:37:37|0:37:42|Having finished eating, on both sides of the small road, groups of three to five villagers basking in the sun gathered together.
0:37:42|0:37:45|[Zhang Lilei] stopped in front of a fruit stand.
0:38:23|0:38:35|[Zhang Lilei] found the shallow stream along the winding path, the clear and tranquil stream flowed over smooth pebbles, draped in a silky sunlight coat, flowing towards the distance and disappearing into the winding mountain cave.
0:38:35|0:38:39|She wears headphones, resembling a butterfly, in the tranquil valley.
0:38:40|0:38:45|Holding a piece of dog tail grass in hand, [Zhang Lilei] moves up and down occasionally along with the music.
0:38:45|0:38:49|In the picturesque landscape, there were no other visitors besides [Zhang Lilei].
0:38:49|0:38:53|A water buffalo stands in the stream, slowly chewing on the grass with its head down.
0:38:53|0:39:1|In the scene, Zhang Lilei gently brushed the water buffalo's nose with the dog tail grass in her hand, resembling the pastoral scene in the painting "Four Seasons of Dao Yu".
0:39:2|0:39:4|The gentle water buffalo is not angry, just quietly allowing itself to be manipulated.
0:39:4|0:39:9|The little crab in the rock crevice is not as easygoing as the water buffalo.
0:39:9|0:39:16|[Zhang Lilei] grasped it, and it vigorously waved the small pincers, always ready to fight in a domineering manner.
0:39:16|0:39:21|[Zhang Lilei] had no choice but to give up and quickly put the small crab back in its original place.
0:39:21|0:39:25|Perhaps due to spending too much time in the city, [Zhang Lilei] is full of curiosity about nature.
0:39:26|0:39:33|Even the small stones by the river, Zhang Lilei can play with them for a long time, everything around him is so novel.
0:39:33|0:39:51|Rather than a visit to the tea trees, this trip for [Zhang Lilei] seemed more like an outing. He played and frolicked along the way for quite a while, until he finally saw the winding stone steps in the dense foliage not far away. Excitedly, [Zhang Lilei] glanced at the layered steps and seized the opportunity to bounce up them.
0:39:51|0:39:54|At the end of the stairs is a narrow corridor.
0:39:54|0:39:57|Walking down the aisle, there is a hidden paradise inside.
0:39:57|0:40:4|Crossing the final step of the stone stairs into the temple, the scene suddenly opened up, unlike the narrow corridor just now.
0:40:4|0:40:14|In the distance, the towering spires reaching into the clouds echo the solemn and majestic temples. A pool of spring water cascades down from the slope, resembling a small waterfall.
0:40:14|0:40:18|At the end of the stone bridge, [Zhang Lilei] was meditating in the small pavilion.
0:40:18|0:40:25|Standing beside him was a young monk, blending harmoniously with the serene and elegant surroundings.
0:40:25|0:40:29|The sound of the temple bell came from afar, clear and crisp, lingering in the air.
0:40:33|0:40:40|[Zhang Lilei] heard the long bell sound, smiled playfully, and walked along the moss-covered water bridge to the two monks at the end of the corridor.
0:41:26|0:41:30|The old monk laid out a bamboo curtain filled with scriptures on the table.
0:41:30|0:41:34|Various tea sets were then neatly arranged in different categories.
0:41:34|0:41:38|The tea stove, tea stove, tea mill, and dozens of other utensils are all available.
0:41:38|0:41:43|The tea set is well maintained, and the clay teapot reveals a beautiful patina.
0:41:43|0:41:46|With a simple and elegant style, [Zhang Lilei] appears graceful and refined.
0:41:46|0:41:49|Even the water for brewing tea is extremely particular.
0:41:49|0:41:52|The young monk carried a wooden bucket and walked towards the riverbank on the other side of the stone bridge.
0:41:53|0:42:1|The scene is reminiscent of Su Shi's poetry, where fire and water still need to spew fire, and the spirit of hanging stones lightens the body.
0:42:1|0:42:14|A piece of charcoal is lit on the teapot, and the smoke slowly disperses. The old monk places the tea axe filled with mountain spring water on the tea stove, picks up a square handkerchief from the side, salutes with his hand, and then slowly lifts the boiling tea axe.
0:42:16|0:42:24|Water is poured into the teacup from top to bottom, without waiting for it to cool down, the old monk immediately picks up the tea chopsticks and pours out the hot water in the teacup.
0:42:24|0:42:30|His movements were fast but methodical, and Zhang Lilei was somewhat fascinated, nodding in approval repeatedly.
0:42:30|0:42:41|The old monk put down the tea chopsticks, picked up the tea axe, and slowly poured hot water into the teapot placed in the tea pool. The hot water quickly soaked the teapot, and the overflowing tea rolled in the tea pool.
0:42:43|0:42:49|He poured out the excess hot water from the pot with a flick of his sleeve, then swirled the tea in the fairness cup.
0:42:49|0:42:54|But the water temperature heats up the justice cup, clearing out the boiling water in the cup, this is the temperature control.
0:42:54|0:42:57|But when everything was ready, the tea ceremony officially began.
0:42:58|0:43:5|The old monk placed the teapot aside, picked up a clay tea canister with his left hand, and held a slender wooden tea spoon with his right hand.
0:43:5|0:43:9|In a room, the tea spoon is filled with excellent orange tea leaves.
0:43:9|0:43:14|Accompanied by the long chime of the clock, the delicate curled tea leaves are also being placed into the teapot.
0:43:14|0:43:20|The old monk raised the tea axe high, and the mountain spring water turned into a thin stream, slowly flowing into the pot.
0:43:20|0:43:27|In the quiet room, with a subtle tea fragrance in the air, he placed the gourd-shaped tea leaves in the fairness cup and slowly poured tea for [Zhang Lilei].
0:44:3|0:44:5|[Zhang Lilei] stops drinking tea.
0:44:7|0:44:13|He followed the abbot's method this time, not rushing to drink the tea, but placing the teacup at the tip of his nose and carefully examining it.
0:44:13|0:44:18|After experiencing the rich and mellow fragrance of the tea, [Zhang Lilei] slowly brought the tea to his mouth.
0:44:18|0:44:21|Abbot poured him a second cup of tea after seeing him finish the first one.
0:44:21|0:44:27|Standing beside, the young monk handed the teacup to [Zhang Lilei], who tried it again following the tea-tasting method.
0:44:56|0:45:1|The melodious sound of the bell rang from afar, and two monks escorted the finished [Zhang Lilei] out of the temple.
0:45:1|0:45:14|[Zhang Lilei] smiled as she descended the stone steps. Just as she reached the corner of the stone slab, she turned to wave goodbye to the two monks, but they were no longer in sight on the stone slab. Only the gentle breeze was left, rustling the branches on the stone walls on both sides.
0:45:14|0:45:17|[Zhang Lilei] sighed with a smile and set off on the road back to the village.
0:45:19|0:45:27|[Zhang Lilei] followed her memory back along the path she had taken earlier. The sky was no longer early, and she focused on hurrying along the road, no longer as distracted as she had been on the way here.
0:45:27|0:45:35|He followed the villagers' instructions in the morning and drifted down the stream to a crossroads.
0:45:35|0:45:40|The stream is divided into three sections here, a situation that Zhang Lilei did not encounter when she arrived.
0:45:40|0:45:46|He looked around the mountains and forests with some confusion, then chose the small path ahead without much hesitation.
0:45:50|0:45:59|The setting sun cast only sporadic rays of light on the earth, and [Zhang Lilei] found herself back at the three-way intersection.
0:45:59|0:46:10|His steps were a bit hurried, his demeanor not as confident as before. He nervously observed the road conditions at the three-way intersection, hesitated, and then stepped onto the small path to the upper left.
0:46:10|0:46:15|The distant roar of a wild beast made him quicken his pace, running hurriedly forward.
0:46:17|0:46:26|After walking on the rocky road for a whole day, [Zhang Lilei]'s steps became unsteady. He continued forward along the water flow, only to realize that he was getting further away from the expected route.
0:46:26|0:46:35|The roar of the beast grew louder, and [Zhang Lilei] quickened her pace. The water source slowly disappeared, and she stood on a large rock to observe the road ahead without error.
0:46:35|0:46:39|Unfortunately, besides the overgrown weeds, there is nothing else here.
0:46:39|0:46:44|He anxiously clutched his head, trying to find the path he had taken among the countless roads around him.
0:46:45|0:46:52|He dashed around like a headless fly, randomly choosing a path and running off.
0:46:52|0:47:0|As the sky grew darker, [Zhang Lilei] eventually returned to the three-way intersection in vain, and the fear of being lost gradually overwhelmed him.
0:47:0|0:47:5|He looked towards the tall mountains in the distance, hastily carrying a bag and ran up the mountain with a bright and spirited pace.
0:47:35|0:47:51|At the same time, in the Song family courtyard, all the men in the village gathered on motorcycles, with dozens of motorcycles turning on their headlights, illuminating the night as bright as day. The grand motorcycle convoy set off one by one in order, embarking on the journey to find Zhang Lilei.
0:47:54|0:47:59|The motorcycle team moved along the winding village road in an orderly manner, with two motorcycles side by side.
0:47:59|0:48:5|The bright car lights, like a surging spring tide, set off on the road to find someone with great momentum.
0:48:5|0:48:9|They illuminated the quiet night, also lighting the way home for [Zhang Lilei].
0:48:14|0:48:24|Dozens of motorcycles formed many dancing long dragons, the low roar echoing through the quiet little village as the convoy orderly passed through the winding path.
0:48:24|0:48:30|Climbing over the undulating mountain road, carefully searching for the figure of [Zhang Lilei] among the dense mountain forests.
0:48:30|0:48:35|Although it was summer, the mountain forest was still a bit cold at night, but the simple villagers didn't mind.
0:48:37|0:48:40|At the foot of the mountain, the convoy could not drive any further.
0:48:40|0:48:44|They gathered around [Song Daxiong], waiting for [Song Daxiong] to give instructions.
0:48:44|0:48:47|[Sung Daxiong] had a large flashlight hanging from his waist.
0:48:47|0:48:54|He struggled to take out his phone and dialed Zhang Lilei's number.
0:49:6|0:49:30|The cheers from the crowd lifted [Zhang Lilei]'s spirits, her expression gradually softened, no longer as flustered as before, gradually relaxing.
0:49:30|0:49:33|[Sung Daxiong] caresses [Zhang Lilei] while searching in the mountains.
0:50:10|0:50:13|[Zhang Lilei] looks at [Song Daxiong] in front of her.
0:50:48|0:51:4|[Mrs. Song] took out an empty tea canister and turned around to continue searching in the cabinet.
0:51:4|0:51:9|[Mrs. Song] pinched a few buds of tea into the pot, and finally just poured them all in.
0:51:14|0:51:25|[Jenny] then took the flashlight, while [Mrs. Song] watched her leave the room. She stood at the door holding a tea can, constantly looking around, her eyes filled with worry and sorrow.
0:51:25|0:51:35|The night was deepening, [Xiao Juan] walked alone on the desolate path, her slender body showing no sign of fear. She arrived at a house with a tea canister in her arms and knocked on the door forcefully.
0:51:37|0:52:1|However, no one opened the door, and he went from house to house with an empty can, inquiring. As each big door opened, the empty teahouse gradually filled with tea from different households, carrying the simple goodwill of the villagers and the unique blessings of the people, along with the tea leaves being sent out. These tea leaves had no distinction of high or low, perhaps the tea had value, but the villagers' blessings were priceless.
0:52:6|0:52:34|When Xiaojuan pushed open the dormitory door with a tea canister filled with concern, [Zhang Lilei] was surrounded by the girls who were comforting her. Everyone looked towards Xiaojuan, "Lilei, this is Baijia tea. My mom said if you drink this tea, the cold in your body will be gone, and you won't get sick." [Zhang Lilei] looked at Xiaojuan in confusion, tears slowly filling her eyes. Seeing her lack of response, Xiaojuan took the initiative to hand over the tea canister.
0:52:35|0:52:42|The night of Xuan Xiao finally passed, and the next day dawned. [Song Daxiong] followed a small path to the tea garden.
0:52:42|0:52:53|The tea plantation was shrouded in mist at this moment, the whole garden appearing and disappearing, walking in it felt like being in a mysterious fairyland. [Zhang Lilei] suddenly stopped in his tracks.
0:53:6|0:53:9|[Song Daxiong] listened, smiled, and stood for a long time before leaving.
0:53:9|0:53:13|Night falls, the girls gather around the computer to discuss.
0:53:30|0:53:36|When everyone was amused by the guy on the computer, [Song Daxiong] and [Zhang Lilei] were whispering to each other in a quiet corner.
0:53:52|0:54:2|[Zhang Lilei] nodded thoughtfully after listening, the next morning in the dim light, [Song Daxiong] stood angrily in front of the bathroom, and there was a big hole in the wall.
0:54:8|0:54:11|[Sung Daxiong] stops [Zhang Lilei] from leaving.
0:54:19|0:54:20|[Zhang Lilei] suddenly realized.
0:54:26|0:54:35|[Song Daxiong] nodded at Zhang Lilei.
0:54:35|0:54:37|Zhang Lilei turned around and looked at [Song Daxiong].
0:54:38|0:54:41|[Sung Daxiong] sighed with a bitter smile.
0:54:41|0:54:45|Zhang Lilei laughed and ran away when she saw [Song Daxiong]'s reaction.
0:54:45|0:55:0|In the afternoon, as the girls finished their day's work and checked the day's results at the inspection point, a luxury car suddenly drove into the tea factory with the roar of the engine.
0:55:13|0:55:17|In the curious gazes of everyone, [Zhang Lilei] lowered her head and slowly raised her hand.
0:55:19|0:56:16|We saw online that there is a type of tea called "Daughter Fragrance," right? Zhang Lilei nodded as the young man in a suit and the foreign boss explained. The girl in front of them is the one who sells tea online. The foreign boss immediately greeted Zhang Lilei, who responded gracefully. In the dormitory, Zhang Lilei slowly took off her solemn clothes, and her friend helped her put on a traditional qipao with intricate clasps. Seeing Zhang Lilei so calm, her friend felt a bit worried. "Are you sure you can do this?" "No problem. I've seen the world. If I can help [Song Daxiong] sell tea successfully once, it would be a way to repay him." Shortly after, the elegantly made-up Zhang Lilei walked into the meeting room. She passed by the tea factory workers on both sides and the foreign businessmen who came to buy tea, and sat down at the tea table. All eyes were on her as she smiled slightly and reached for a tea cup displayed on the table.
0:56:19|0:56:25|[Zhang Lilei]'s hand, however, seemed to have a mind of its own as the teacup mischievously wobbled in her grasp.
0:56:25|0:56:34|[Zhang Lilei] remained calm, steadied herself, arranged the tea cups neatly, and tried to pick up the tea spoon. However, no matter how hard she tried, the tea spoon wouldn't come out.
0:56:34|0:56:37|Her brows furrowed gradually as she quickened her movements.
0:56:39|0:56:45|He made a clever move, although he took out the teaspoon, the other tea utensils were scattered on the table.
0:56:45|0:56:50|He tidied up the messy table, but then put the tea spoon filled with tea leaves into the public cup.
0:56:50|0:56:56|The chaotic situation made everyone look at [Zhang Lilei] nervously.
0:56:56|0:57:1|[Zhang Lilei] continued trembling with both hands, the more flustered he became, the more chaotic his actions were.
0:57:1|0:57:7|He poured the tea from the justice cup into the tea cup, looked up at the stunned crowd, and took a deep breath.
0:57:13|0:57:15|The resigned [Zhang Lilei] quickly received the large teapot.
0:57:15|0:57:20|Because it has been used for a long time, there are faint cracks and tea stains on the teapot.
0:57:20|0:57:24|The tea pot, not very exquisite, is handled with even more ease by [Zhang Lilei].
0:57:24|0:57:29|She placed the teapot on the table and added a handful of Baijia tea leaves into the pot.
0:57:29|0:57:33|Boiling water was poured directly into the teapot, and [Zhang Lilei] nodded in satisfaction and sat down.
0:58:38|0:58:41|Zhang Lilei's friend Qing, who was clapping, had tears in her eyes.
0:58:44|0:58:49|Everyone was amused by her, and [Zhang Lilei] stood up and walked towards the crowd.
0:58:56|0:59:3|[Zhang Lilei] handed the tea cup to the foreign businessman next to her, and the whole village looked at her, waiting for the final judgment.
0:59:3|0:59:20|After taking a sip, [Zhang Lilei] nodded and continuously praised the rich and fragrant taste of her daughter's hometown. Hearing this compliment, everyone breathed a sigh of relief.
0:59:20|0:59:22|Night falls, [Song Daxiong] grips the motorcycle carrying [Zhang Lilei].
1:0:14|1:0:21|Oh, [Zhang Lilei] stared blankly at the lake, hesitantly speaking.
1:0:27|1:0:31|[Sung Daxiong] kept touching his pants leg and continued.
1:0:58|1:1:0|She shed a tear as she left.
1:1:12|1:1:16|[Zhang Lilei] scrutinized [Song Daxiong] with a probing gaze.
1:1:16|1:1:22|[Sung Daxiong] shyly turned his head, and [Zhang Lilei] laughed at his reaction.
1:1:22|1:1:26|Bathed in the bright moonlight, [Zhang Lilei] shed her clothes, resembling a fairy bathing in the Heavenly Pool as told in the legends.
1:2:29|1:2:36|[Zhang Lilei] suddenly sneezed, and [Song Daxiong] turned around with concern, quickly covering his eyes behind her smooth back.
1:2:37|1:2:45|After Zhang Lilei finished writing, Song Daxiong took him back to the dormitory entrance.
1:2:45|1:2:47|[Sung Daxiong] is reluctant to look at [Zhang Lilei].
1:3:20|1:3:25|Tea workers and various tea-making machines appeared in front of the courtyard.
1:3:56|1:4:2|Wei Jiafeng's tea is tumbling in the machine, going through a series of processes, and eventually transforming into tea.
1:4:4|1:4:9|[Songs Daxiong] led [Zhang Lilei] as they continued to walk towards the front of the factory building.
1:4:44|1:4:49|[Sung Daxiong] walked towards the innermost room, smiling as he looked at the tea-making tools inside.
1:4:51|1:5:0|He confidently lit the stove, the scorching fire heated the tea pot, preparing everything. As he stood up, the tea roasting officially began.
1:5:15|1:5:26|[Sung Daxiong]'s rough hands kept stirring in the tea pan, the dried tea leaves were tossed in his hands and gradually took shape, the faint fragrance of tea permeated the heart and spleen.
1:5:26|1:5:33|[Zhang Lilei] stood aside watching his skillful movements, hesitated for a long time, and finally placed her hand on [Song Daxiong]'s arm.
1:5:33|1:5:38|[Song Daxiong] was taken aback by his actions and looked flustered at the shy-faced [Zhang Lilei].
1:5:38|1:5:42|Under the guidance of [Zhang Lilei], their hands slowly intertwined.
1:5:43|1:5:47|[Sung Daxiong] stood there dumbfounded, instinctively following [Zhang Lilei]'s movements.
1:5:47|1:5:52|[Zhang Lilei] raised her hand and gently pulled [Song Daxiong]'s chin, slowly approaching his lips.
1:5:52|1:5:58|In the quiet night, their hearts draw closer and closer, with warm lips already touching.
1:5:58|1:6:2|[Songs Daxiong] quietly reached out his arm and pulled [Zhang Lilei] into his embrace.
1:6:3|1:6:14|They kissed passionately in the night, instinctively wanting to hold the person in front of them. No one noticed when Luo Mingying appeared at the door.
1:6:14|1:6:17|[Sung Daxiong] suddenly looked up and saw Luo Mingying at the door.
1:6:24|1:6:32|Luo Mingying finished speaking and turned to leave, leaving the room in an awkward silence, with only the tea leaves in the tea pot emitting a faint fragrance that no one paid attention to.
1:6:34|1:6:41|After a chaotic night, in the courtyard of the Song family, Song's mother looked at the girls picking tea in the distance.
1:6:47|1:6:58|After Mrs. Song finished speaking, [Song Daxiong], who was watering the vegetables, turned his head and looked at the girl in the tea garden behind him, a happy smile appearing on his simple and honest face.
1:6:58|1:7:2|In the tea plantation, the girls were also discussing their own topics, [Fostering Friendship] ran towards [Zhang Lilei].
1:7:43|1:7:46|[Lian Youqing] looked at the two people playing dumb riddles with some confusion.
1:7:46|1:7:50|[Zhang Lilei] did not explain to him, but walked towards Luo Mingying with the stele in her hand.
1:7:50|1:7:53|[Lian Youqing] shrugged and stopped asking further questions.
1:7:53|1:8:0|Luo Mingying saw [Zhang Lilei] approaching, turned around and took her to a secluded place where there was no one around, hesitated for a long time before slowly speaking.
1:9:2|1:9:18|Luo Mingying finished speaking, turned around and walked away without giving Zhang Lilei time to explain. As soon as she turned around, Zhang Lilei raised her hand to wipe away the tears from the corner of her eyes, quickened her pace, wanting to escape this heartbreaking place as soon as possible. Zhang Lilei looked at her guiltily, gazing at her stubborn figure, slowly lowered her head and sighed.
1:9:22|1:9:28|The sun was setting in the west, the girls lined up and walked out of the tea garden, and [Song Daxiong] had been waiting at the door for a long time.
1:9:28|1:9:34|He smiled and waved to the girls, but his eyes were fixed on Zhang Lilei standing next to Ling Youqin.
1:9:34|1:9:39|Zhang Lilei passed by Song Daxiong without saying a word, and even dodged to the side where her friend Qin was.
1:9:39|1:9:41|[Sung Daxiong] looked on in disappointment, stunned for a long time.
1:9:47|1:9:59|In the evening, the girls who had been busy all day gathered on the rooftop in groups of three or four, chatting and laughing. [Song Daxiong] thoughtfully brewed tea for them and delivered it one by one. "Thank you, Daxiong ge, thank you, Daxiong ge."
1:10:7|1:10:20|The girls all thanked Song Daxiong for his kindness, but when the tea was brought to Zhang Lilei, she just took the cup coldly and remained silent. Song Daxiong could no longer maintain his smile, and he walked away disappointedly with the tray.
1:10:20|1:10:38|Zhang Lilei's carefree friend Qin also sensed something was wrong, looking at [Zhang Lilei] with confusion. [Zhang Lilei] didn't offer much explanation, just shook her head and brushed it off. The evening breeze accompanied the nightfall, and the office of the tea factory was bustling. [Song Daxiong] was playing with plants on the side, while the girls gathered around the computer.
1:10:38|1:10:49|Watching the video chat between the girl walking diagonally and her boyfriend, the girl beside her played with a teacup in boredom, a scene reminiscent of a few days ago, only missing Zhang Lilei and another friend.
1:10:51|1:10:59|Hearing the greeting, [Song Daxiong] relaxed his furrowed brow, smiled at the girls, and continued to tinker with the plants on the shelf.
1:10:59|1:11:4|At this moment in the dormitory, Ling Youqin and [Zhang Lilei] are having a heart-to-heart talk, she picks up a teacup.
1:11:44|1:11:46|[Zhang Lilei] had a look of worry written all over her face.
1:11:46|1:11:51|Early the next morning, [Song Daxiong] was also extremely frustrated while picking vegetables in the courtyard with his mother, [Zhang Lilei].
1:11:51|1:11:55|[Son's Mother] glanced at her son.
1:12:30|1:12:35|[Sung Daxiong] stared blankly at the table.
1:12:35|1:12:39|[Mrs. Song] saw [Song Daxiong]'s reaction and turned to look at the girls picking tea not far away.
1:13:7|1:13:16|Not far away, [Zhang Lilei] is picking tea leaves, her movements becoming more and more skillful, behaving like a native of the tea-growing region.
1:13:16|1:13:19|The sky is getting dark, the moon is shining brightly, and the trees cast swaying shadows.
1:13:19|1:13:31|[Sung Daxiong] squatted in front of the stone wall outside the bathroom, quietly listening to the cheers of the girls inside the house. His hands were tangled together, his brows furrowed, his mouth tightly twisted, the calm atmosphere around him starkly contrasting with the excitement inside the house.
1:13:34|1:13:37|The scene changes, and it's already two months later.
1:13:37|1:13:44|The picking season of spring tea quickly passed, and the girls were ready to return to their hometowns, pulling their suitcases one after another.
1:14:3|1:14:9|[Zhang Lilei] hurriedly handed the luggage to her friend Ling Youqin and ran up to the rooftop.
1:14:9|1:14:17|She hurriedly ran towards the clothesline, and sure enough, her clothes were hanging alone on the clothesline, swaying weakly in the wind.
1:14:17|1:14:20|She hurried forward to take the clothes, but turned around to see someone not far away.
1:14:23|1:14:28|[Zhang Lilei] sighed helplessly in his direction, picked up the clothes in his hand, and left.
1:14:28|1:14:33|In the rush, he did not notice a pair of socks he had missed on the clothesline.
1:14:33|1:14:36|Approaching noon, the girls had already boarded the bus, ready to set off.
1:14:39|1:14:44|The bus carrying the girls was surrounded by villagers reluctant to say goodbye.
1:14:44|1:14:51|They gathered in front of the car to bid farewell to the girls. The older sister who received the face mask from [Zhang Lilei] pushed through the crowd and walked towards the car window with a package in hand.
1:14:54|1:14:59|[Zhang Lilei] looked back at the departing crowd with a sense of loss.
1:15:16|1:15:24|After bidding farewell to the villagers, the bus slowly started, bypassing the reluctant villagers, and heading along the winding village road towards the tea-scented destination.
1:15:24|1:15:28|Not long after they left, there was a loud banging on the door of the bus from outside.
1:15:34|1:15:38|[Zhang Lilei] hurriedly ran out of her seat and waited in front of the car door.
1:15:38|1:15:44|Doctor Niu wrote down the four characters "心由境生" and looked at Zhang Lilei.
1:15:44|1:15:45|[Zhang Lilei] steps forward.
1:16:6|1:16:35|After [Luo Mingying] settled down, the driver turned on the music and looked back at the girls in the car. With the music playing, the group set off again, swaying along the road. The bus traveled along the flat village road and arrived at a narrow path next to the valley. The winding path merged with the distant mountains. The bus swayed along the mountain road, carrying the girls towards the city. Dense trees lined the sides of the road, waving their branches vigorously as if bidding farewell to the girls.
1:16:40|1:16:47|Sunlight streamed through the car window onto [Zhang Lilei]'s face as she lowered her gaze and stared blankly at the scenery outside.
1:16:47|1:16:56|At this moment, [Zhang Lilei] in Changyuanli is also feeling down. He stands blankly at the door of the female workers' dormitory, but unfortunately, there is no one here, and the girls did not leave anything behind.
1:16:56|1:17:0|The spring breeze suddenly rose, blowing away the curtains and also stirring up his thoughts.
1:17:2|1:17:29|[Sung Daxiong] looked at the socks dropped by [Zhang Lilei], staring blankly without knowing what he was thinking. In the bus at this moment, [Nie Youqin] reached out for [Zhang Lilei]'s hand. Is there still time now? [Zhang Lilei] shook her head with a serious face. Seeing her shake her head, [Nie Youqin] could only turn her head to look ahead, no longer talking to [Zhang Lilei]. At the same time, in the [Song Family Courtyard], [Song Mother] and [Xiao Juan] were tidying up the tea house that the girls had placed in the courtyard.
1:17:54|1:18:5|[Sung Daxiong] was standing by the stone wall outside the bathroom, frowning. [Village Chief] slowly walked up to him, seeing no response from [Sung Daxiong], the [Village Chief] continued.
1:18:41|1:18:47|[The Village Chief] laughed and patted [Zhang Lilei]'s arm, hooked his shoulder, and led him away.
1:18:47|1:18:53|The two walked side by side to the courtyard of [Song Daxiong]'s house, with [Song Daxiong] still frowning heavily, looking burdened with worries.
1:18:53|1:18:57|Xiao Juan warmly greeted the village chief when she saw him.
1:19:2|1:19:9|Pouring water, [Mrs. Song] set aside the work in her hands and sat down at a small table with [Song Daxiong] and the village chief.
1:19:9|1:19:16|The three of them looked at each other in silence, none daring to break the awkward atmosphere.
1:19:16|1:19:19|The village chief nervously looked around.
1:19:20|1:19:22|The village chief's words made the atmosphere even more bizarre.
1:19:22|1:19:26|[Mrs. Song] leaned over to look at the silent [Song Daxiong].
1:19:27|1:19:30|As soon as he left, [Mrs. Song] looked towards the village chief.
1:19:55|1:19:59|[Sung Daxiong] brought the tea set over and then went back inside to get other tools.
1:20:2|1:20:7|[Mrs. Song] looked at [Song Daxiong] with skepticism, cleared her throat, and prepared to tame him with a stern look.
1:20:9|1:20:14|[Song Daxiong] poked his head out and walked from the house to the small table, carrying a teapot.
1:20:14|1:20:16|Song's mother scanned him sharply.
1:21:25|1:21:27|[Sung Daxiong] hurriedly ran out of the tea garden.
1:21:51|1:21:55|The village chief waved his hand at [Song Daxiong] and fumbled in his suit pocket.
1:21:59|1:22:4|[Sung Daxiong] looked at the village chief in confusion, who fumbled for a while before finally pulling out a phone book.
1:22:4|1:22:12|The village chief, ignoring [Song Daxiong], squinted his eyes and flipped through the thick phone book on his own.
1:22:12|1:22:20|After a while, the village chief finally found the target, took out his phone from his waist, and carefully compared the numbers in the phone book before dialing a call.
1:22:20|1:22:34|On the return bus, the driver's phone suddenly rang, and he searched around before answering the call.
1:22:36|1:22:47|After speaking, the village chief walked forward gracefully.
1:22:47|1:22:49|After speaking, the village chief walked forward gracefully.
1:22:55|1:23:26|[Song Daxiong] finally relaxed his furrowed brow and revealed a simple smile. The bus driver slammed on the brakes after hanging up the phone, causing the bus to emit a piercing friction sound. The girls on the bus looked at the driver in panic. "Master, what's going on?" "I told you, if I move forward by one meter, I'll injure my leg." The girls were all puzzled. "If my leg is broken, I won't be able to drive." The protective driver finished speaking and ignored the girls.
1:23:26|1:23:46|Zhang Lilei admired the beautiful scenery outside the window, with tall and dense trees on both sides of the road, their trunks of various thicknesses stretching out lush branches and leaves. The driver turned on the music button, and the melodious singing came softly, gradually immersing him in the cheerful song, his fingers lightly tapping on the steering wheel following the rhythm of the music.
1:23:46|1:24:0|He seemed to recall something, took out a can of tea from the side of the seat, disregarding the proper tea-making utensils and procedures, used his hands to grab a handful of tea leaves and put them into a glass cup. He picked up the nearby hot water pot, quickly brewed a cup of hot tea.
1:24:3|1:24:10|He gently blew away the hot air while holding the steaming tea cup, then took a small sip of the fragrant tea. [Zhang Lilei]
1:24:10|1:24:16|The girls in the car were indifferent and relieved, in stark contrast to the driver's leisurely demeanor.
1:24:16|1:24:20|They kept adjusting their sitting positions, gazing out the window with a sense of distance between the opposite sexes.
1:24:20|1:24:26|The sun was getting stronger and stronger, waiting boringly for who knows when it would end, and someone simply put on sunglasses and fell asleep deeply.
1:24:28|1:24:39|On the winding road outside, a car broke the tranquility of the mountains and forests, driving from a small path behind the bus and coming to a sudden stop not far from the bus.
1:24:43|1:24:47|Before the car even came to a complete stop, a figure slowly stepped out from inside the car.
1:24:47|1:24:52|She hesitated outside the car for a moment before gathering up the courage to walk towards the bus.
1:24:52|1:24:58|The girls in the car have also noticed him at this moment, one by one leaning their heads out of the window curiously looking around.
1:24:59|1:25:5|The figure walked to the front of the bus and stood still. It was then that the girls realized the one chasing the bus was [Song Daxiong].
1:25:5|1:25:13|[Zhang Lilei] looked earnestly at [Song Daxiong] outside the car, only to see [Song Daxiong] cupping his hands into a trumpet shape and shouting something loudly.
1:25:13|1:25:21|Due to the barrier of music and car windows, [Zhang Lilei] stood up as she couldn't hear clearly.
1:25:21|1:25:25|The music stops, but [Zhang Lilei] still can't hear clearly what [Song Daxiong] is shouting in the car.
1:25:27|1:25:31|The girls rolled down the car window to listen, but it was in vain.
1:25:40|1:25:43|The car door opened, and [Zhang Lilei] hurriedly got out of the car.
1:25:43|1:25:50|After getting off the car, she didn't appear as anxious as before. Instead, she walked towards [Song Daxiong] expressionlessly step by step.
1:25:50|1:25:54|[Sung Daxiong] put down his hands in confusion, not daring to make eye contact with [Zhang Lilei].
1:26:2|1:26:5|[Zhang Lilei] slowly lifted his head.
1:26:9|1:26:12|Song Daxiong lowered his head again.
1:26:20|1:26:47|Without waiting for [Song Daxiong] to finish speaking, [Zhang Lilei] suddenly cried into his arms. The two of them were very close, and [Zhang Lilei] pressed her lips against [Song Daxiong]. The unspoken words melted in the warmth of their kiss. The heavens, earth, and mountains witnessed the overflowing love between them. At this moment, no one could separate them. The beauty of this moment made them forget everything around them. The village chief, with his mouth wide open, peeked at the two people sleeping. The bus driver silently dialed the village chief's phone number.
1:26:51|1:26:56|The bus started again, slowly moving around the two people who embraced each other and didn't want to separate.
1:26:56|1:27:1|The girl in the car stuck her head out, waved goodbye to [Song Daxiong] and [Zhang Lilei].
1:27:1|1:27:12|The bus gradually disappeared on the winding and twisting small road, and the story of tea fragrance also slowly came to an end.
