0:1:4|0:1:26|On the eve of the 2007 Chinese New Year, the train station was packed with people of all kinds bustling on the platform. As the train arrived, everyone rushed forward with their luggage in tow. The train attendants stood straight at the door, staring intently at each passenger boarding the train. Inside the carriage, it was extremely crowded.
0:1:26|0:1:38|The person who came up front was busy putting away luggage, while the person at the back was struggling to find a seat with their luggage. For a moment, the carriage was filled with the cries of children and the noisy chatter of people, with some standing on chairs to place their luggage.
0:1:38|0:1:44|Some people are holding tickets and looking for their seats, while those who arrived early are already sitting in their seats and dozing off.
0:1:44|0:1:49|Not far away, the voice of the steward brother woke up the sleeping passengers, urging everyone to check their tickets.
0:1:49|0:1:58|Passengers took out their tickets for inspection one after another, with [Fang Xiaoxiao] sporting a short haircut, anxiously searching for something next to her seat.
0:2:27|0:2:38|[Lin Jianqing], wearing a hoodie and black-framed glasses, stood behind [Fang Xiaoxiao], shaking the ticket in his hand. His delicate face revealed a hint of shyness, with gentle smiles in his eyes as he looked at [Fang Xiaoxiao].
0:2:38|0:2:45|[Fang Xiaoxiao] saw [Lin Jianqing] as if she had seen a savior, her eyes filled with gratitude and curiosity, nodding eagerly at him.
0:2:45|0:2:52|The scene shifts to 11 years later, on the eve of the Spring Festival in 2018, [Lin Jianqing] has just boarded the plane.
0:2:53|0:3:0|[Lin Jianqing] lifts the suitcase and puts it on the luggage rack.
0:3:0|0:3:4|A passerby accidentally bumped into him from behind and waved apologetically.
0:3:4|0:3:9|[Lin Jianqing] turned his head to respond, only to see a familiar figure, [Fang Xiaoxiao]. The flight attendant smiled and gestured for everyone to sit down.
0:3:14|0:3:20|Lin Jianqing sat in his seat wearing a Bluetooth earphone, staring blankly ahead.
0:3:20|0:3:25|[Fang Xiaoxiao] slowly peeks out from the seat behind him, secretly observing him.
0:3:25|0:3:33|His eyes revealed a long-lost joy, but also couldn't hide the loneliness, as [Lin Jianqing] hung his head in dejection.
0:3:33|0:3:40|After a long silence, Lin Jianqing couldn't help but turn his head and look back. Fang Xiaoxiao had already sat back in her seat, but Lin Jianqing did not see her.
0:3:40|0:3:47|Fang Xiaoxiao seemed to feel Lin Jianqing's gaze as he tried hard to find her location and peeked his head out of his seat.
0:3:47|0:4:0|[Lin Jianqing] couldn't hide his joy in his eyes, and [Fang Xiaoxiao] smiled at him. Ten years later, the two met again, but they were already the most familiar strangers.
0:4:44|0:4:51|The train was moving forward in the icy snow, and at that moment, Lin Jianqing and Fang Xiaoxiao met on the train as if they had known each other for a long time.
0:4:51|0:4:54|The two quickly became acquainted.
0:5:2|0:5:7|Two people were leaning against the window, looking at the scenery outside, when suddenly the train began to slow down.
0:5:7|0:5:8|Stopped shortly after.
0:5:17|0:5:25|Due to the weather, the train was forced to stop, and everyone had to sit on the train and wait. [Lin Jianqing] was sleeping soundly with his head down.
0:5:25|0:5:33|[Fang Xiaoxiao] was bored, passing the time by holding a newspaper. She put down the newspaper, glanced at [Lin Jianqing], and then turned to look out the window.
0:5:33|0:5:34|Suddenly, his eyes lit up.
0:5:34|0:5:43|She held her breath and shook [Lin Jianqing] awake. [Lin Jianqing] opened her eyes groggily and looked in the direction pointed by [Fang Xiaoxiao], suddenly widening her eyes.
0:5:43|0:5:47|A swaying deer antler suddenly appeared in the snowy field, followed by a slowly emerging head.
0:5:47|0:6:2|The two looked at the sudden appearance of the little deer, their faces showing a delighted smile. The deer frolicked in the snow, completely unaware that it had caught the attention of the two people in the train. As they watched, they suddenly turned their heads to look at each other.
0:6:2|0:6:10|[Fang Xiaoxiao] signaled to [Lin Jianqing] to get off the car. [Lin Jianqing] looked around hesitantly, then got off the car with [Fang Xiaoxiao]'s insistence.
0:6:12|0:6:18|Zheng Huan and Chen Dewen also got off the car shortly after.
0:7:24|0:7:30|[Lin Jianqing] held one end of the scarf, while the other end was held by [Fang Xiaoxiao], and the two of them walked back laughing.
0:7:50|0:8:0|[Lin Jianqing] reached out and grabbed [Fang Xiaoxiao] who was passing by. [Fang Xiaoxiao] smiled at him and did not refuse. [Lin Jianqing] skillfully carried [Fang Xiaoxiao]'s luggage.
0:8:0|0:8:2|Lin Jianqing and Fang Xiaoxiao got off the plane one after the other.
0:8:28|0:8:40|The person behind them urged, [Fang Xiaoxiao] hurriedly took his ticket and they turned to leave. Despite their reluctance, they ended up in the same hotel room, pushing their luggage in and finding only one bed inside.
0:8:52|0:9:2|[Fang Xiaoxiao] turned back, glanced at [Lin Jianqing], and then closed the door. With one hand dragging her luggage, she stood in place looking at [Lin Jianqing]. [Lin Jianqing] spoke. He stood by the window watching [Fang Xiaoxiao].
0:9:23|0:9:25|The two of them were searching for topics, but the atmosphere remained very oppressive.
0:9:25|0:9:28|After a long pause, [Lin Jianqing] spoke.
0:9:30|0:9:41|[Lin Jianqing] finished speaking and then lowered his head in silence, as if it wasn't a question at all. He looked much older, with a few strands of white hair on his head. [Fang Xiaoxiao] didn't answer him, just sat slowly on the edge of the bed in silence.
0:10:8|0:10:18|The scene shifts back to 11 years ago, [Fang Xiaoxiao] returned to her hometown and greeted the neighbors before hurrying back home and closing the door.
0:10:33|0:10:40|[Fang Xiaoxiao] hadn't even had time to put down her backpack before skillfully fixing the old light bulb in the room. After tidying up, she sat in a chair lost in thought.
0:10:40|0:11:6|The furniture in the room has become old and dusty, the walls are also worn out. She took out the chocolate sent by her mother, glanced at the portrait of her father on the wall, blew off the dust on the table, placed a piece of peeled chocolate on it, then took out another piece, pulled out the card from the wrapper and placed it on the table. She then broke the chocolate in her hand, picked up one piece and put it in her mouth. As she chewed and savored the chocolate's aroma, a happy smile appeared on her face.
0:11:6|0:11:14|[Lin Jianqing] also returned home, where his father was busy in the kitchen preparing the New Year's Eve dinner. [Lin Jianqing] walked in with a bowl in his hands.
0:11:26|0:11:32|Lin's Father lifts the lid of the steamer next to him, revealing steaming hot sticky rice dumplings inside.
0:12:9|0:12:14|[Lin Jianqing] ignored [Lin's Father]'s insults and walked straight to the door. He looked outside through the glass on the door.
0:12:14|0:12:22|I unexpectedly saw [Fang Xiaoxiao]'s figure. She was wearing a knitted hat, a fitted long cotton-padded coat, and setting off firecrackers with two children in the snow.
0:12:22|0:12:30|[Lin Jianqing] looked up, smiled, pushed the door open, and walked out. He stood at the doorway, smiling foolishly at [Fang Xiaoxiao], with a sign above his head that read "Lin's Family Restaurant".
0:12:32|0:12:41|[Fang Xiaoxiao] held a few just lit sparklers in her hand, looked back at [Lin Jianqing], who extinguished the cigarette in his hand and threw it on the ground, and the two walked towards each other.
0:12:44|0:12:49|[Fang Xiaoxiao] was wearing a pair of high-heeled shoes, and as soon as she finished speaking, she stumbled and almost slipped.
0:13:59|0:14:4|After finishing the New Year's Eve dinner, it was already pitch black outside, with only the lantern in front of the door emitting a festive glow.
0:14:4|0:14:12|[Lin Jianqing] and [Fang Xiaoxiao] pushed open the door and walked out.
0:14:42|0:14:55|She glanced at [Lin Jianqing], and the two of them burst into laughter. Old Lin was alone at home, sitting at the dining table watching TV. There was half a bottle of wine on the table, and the room was lit only by a dim desk lamp, emitting a faint light.
0:14:55|0:15:8|Old Lin's Father pressed the button on the remote control, but the long-neglected TV did not respond. He slowly stood up and walked over, knocking on the TV's back.
0:17:32|0:17:43|The scene shifts, [Lin Jianqing], [Zheng Huan], and [Chen Dewen] and their group of buddies are eating skewers at the night market. [Lin Jianqing] turns his head to look towards the entrance and quickly stands up, only to see [Fang Xiaoxiao] walking in with a man.
0:17:43|0:17:52|[Fang Xiaoxiao] pretended not to know them on purpose, pulling the man to sit next to [Lin Jianqing], causing [Lin Jianqing]'s smile to disappear instantly.
0:18:58|0:19:4|[Lin Jianqing] looked displeased, raised the wine bottle and tapped Sun Yilong's glass. Sun Yilong frowned and drank it down.
0:19:4|0:19:12|After dinner, [Lin Jianqing] and [Fang Xiaoxiao] escorted the heavily drunk Sun Yilong back home. Unable to hold back any longer, [Lin Jianqing] finally asked, "What's going on?"
0:19:51|0:19:59|As if implying something, [Fang Xiaoxiao] looked at the serious [Lin Jianqing], not knowing what to say for a moment. She looked ahead for a while, then back at [Lin Jianqing].
0:19:59|0:20:10|It seemed that [Lin Jianqing] had never thought about it, but he smiled self-deprecatingly, looked away, and [Fang Xiaoxiao] saw him distracted, then also laughed.
0:20:59|0:21:4|After Fang Xiaoxiao finished speaking, she walked away with a happy smile on her face.
0:21:49|0:21:55|Lin Jianqing, bidding farewell with his good friend Zheng Huan, was interrupted by a phone call from Fang Xiaoxiao. As the scene shifted,
0:21:55|0:22:9|[Lin Jianqing] rode a bicycle with several large bags of luggage behind him, along with [Fang Xiaoxiao]. They stopped in front of a residential building, struggling to unload the luggage from the bike. The two of them then dragged the large bags of luggage into the dilapidated, dirty, and narrow corridor, one in front and one behind.
0:22:9|0:22:17|Upon reaching the elevator, [Lin Jianqing] stepped in first, then turned around to wait for [Fang Xiaoxiao]. In the corner of the elevator sat an auntie.
0:22:17|0:22:25|Holding a thermos in hand, Lin's Father glanced at the two of them. When Fang Xiaoxiao entered, Auntie gave them a big eye roll and closed the elevator door.
0:22:25|0:22:34|Upstairs, in a long corridor, each household is next to each other. The two of them walked into a room, which was divided into many compartments and filled with people.
0:22:39|0:22:46|Lin Jianqing and Fang Xiaoxiao struggled to carry their luggage, passing by one room after another. An old man stood at the doorway of a room, watching them curiously.
0:22:46|0:22:54|The man in the next room sat in front of the computer desk waving enthusiastically at [Fang Xiaoxiao], as [Lin Jianqing] opened the door and they both dragged the luggage inside.
0:22:54|0:23:14|In front of the eyes is a small room of less than ten square meters. Under the dim light, there is a cluttered computer desk and a small bed leaning against the wall. [Lin Jianqing] puts the food into the refrigerator in the communal kitchen, then takes out a few bottles of beer. The two of them stand in the room and start drinking.
0:23:16|0:23:32|[Lin Jianqing] turned on the fan in the corner, while [Fang Xiaoxiao] sat silently on the chair next to the computer desk. [Lin Jianqing] leaned back comfortably on the bed, with a look of a child waiting for praise. He then got up and turned on the small night light on the bedside table, smiling at [Fang Xiaoxiao].
0:23:32|0:23:37|[Fang Xiaoxiao] remained silent, with a dejected look and head lowered.
0:23:38|0:23:46|[Lin Jianqing] sat down on the stool and said. [Fang Xiaoxiao] stood up and took off the backpack on her back.
0:24:11|0:24:15|The two of them packed up quietly, with [Lin Jianqing] holding a cigarette ready to light it.
0:24:37|0:24:52|[Fang Xiaoxiao] looked up and saw her smeared makeup reflection in the mirror. At that moment, a disheveled woman in a bathrobe walked in, holding a can of beer and said something. [Lin Jianqing] stood up nervously.
0:24:52|0:24:55|[Fang Xiaoxiao] smiled and stood in front of him.
0:24:59|0:25:2|[Fang Xiaoxiao] leaned against [Lin Jianqing], looking at the woman provocatively.
0:25:2|0:25:9|The woman, with wet hair, rolled her eyes at [Fang Xiaoxiao] and turned around to leave.
0:25:18|0:25:26|Before leaving, [Lin Jianqing] still couldn't help but flirt with him. [Lin Jianqing] turned his head to avoid laughing, and after the woman left, the two couldn't help but burst into laughter.
0:25:26|0:25:32|At night, Lin Jianqing made a bed on the floor next to the bed, while Fang Xiaoxiao slept on the bed.
0:25:32|0:25:36|In the dim room, only the faint light of the bedside lamp was on.
0:25:36|0:25:40|[Lin Jianqing] lay on his side with his back to [Fang Xiaoxiao], flipping through his phone.
0:25:40|0:25:46|[Fang Xiaoxiao] wrapped in a blanket, stared at the ceiling with her eyes open.
0:25:46|0:25:55|At this moment, there was a thought-provoking sound coming from upstairs. [Fang Xiaoxiao] couldn't help but laugh, so [Lin Jianqing] deliberately cleared his throat loudly to avoid embarrassment.
0:25:55|0:26:2|[Fang Xiaoxiao] smiled and kicked [Lin Jianqing]'s butt, causing [Lin Jianqing] to jerk his head around.
0:26:3|0:26:11|[Lin Jianqing] plays a song on his portable music player and hands the earphones to [Fang Xiaoxiao], who puts on both earphones.
0:26:33|0:26:40|[Lin Jianqing] listened and slowly turned towards the bed, moving closer and closer to each other.
0:26:49|0:26:54|With the sound of a toilet flushing, [Lin Jianqing] yawned and pushed open the door of the bathroom.
0:26:54|0:27:2|He returned to the room, closed the door, and walked towards the bed in a daze. He habitually lay down on the bed and closed his eyes.
0:27:2|0:27:23|[Fang Xiaoxiao] was sleeping soundly with the blanket rolled up on the inner side of the bed. Suddenly, she turned over and lay flat on her back, drowsily placing her legs on [Lin Jianqing]'s legs. [Lin Jianqing]'s drowsiness disappeared instantly, his eyes widened and he dared not move, realizing he was in the wrong bed. Worried about being discovered, he carefully moved his body, afraid of waking up [Fang Xiaoxiao].
0:27:23|0:27:32|He reached down to the floor with one leg hanging off the edge of the bed, then slowly moved downwards, trying hard to pull out the leg and arm that were pinned down by [Fang Xiaoxiao].
0:27:32|0:27:52|Unexpectedly, [Fang Xiaoxiao] made a sudden movement, causing [Lin Jianqing] to immediately stop and hold his breath, observing [Fang Xiaoxiao]'s actions. After confirming that everything was fine after a short while, he continued to struggle to free his leg, then smoothly rolled onto the nearby floor. He lay on his side with his back to the bed, panting heavily, curling up carefully into a ball, and then pulled the blanket behind him over with his legs.
0:27:52|0:27:57|An unexpected encounter left [Lin Jianqing] unable to calm down for a long time, trying hard to restrain himself.
0:28:36|0:28:43|Chen Dewen stood by the counter with his back to Lin Jianqing, hesitating for a moment before finally speaking.
0:28:44|0:28:52|[Lin Jianqing] remained silent. [Chen Dewen] paused and made up his mind to speak.
0:29:5|0:29:10|[Fang Xiaoxiao] and the male customer appeared on the escalator on the side, chatting enthusiastically.
0:29:10|0:29:16|[Lin Jianqing] stared at the two with a grim expression, and when [Chen Dewen] tried to step forward to calm the situation, he was pushed away by [Lin Jianqing].
0:29:43|0:29:50|[Fang Xiaoxiao] leaned against the door eating something, while the neighbor man asked with a meaningful look.
0:30:20|0:30:23|[Lin Jianqing] finished speaking and excitedly slapped his leg.
0:30:23|0:30:34|When he turned his head and saw [Fang Xiaoxiao] by chance, his smile immediately disappeared. The neighbor man looked at them with a suggestive expression.
0:31:1|0:31:8|[Lin Jianqing] glanced at [Fang Xiaoxiao] and asked.
0:31:34|0:31:40|Lin Jianqing's expression gradually became serious.
0:31:51|0:31:59|[Lin Jianqing] stood up, hands in pockets leaning against the wall, and let out a cold laugh.
0:32:3|0:32:10|[Fang Xiaoxiao] ignored him and rolled her eyes at him. At this moment, a person approached the stall and asked mysteriously.
0:32:38|0:32:44|[Fang Xiaoxiao] saw that the two were about to fight, so she had to come up with a quick solution and shouted.
0:33:0|0:33:4|Back in the rental room, [Fang Xiaoxiao] hung up the phone while holding a freshly brewed instant noodle.
0:33:4|0:33:11|[Lin Jianqing] said with a dark expression.
0:33:31|0:33:36|[Lin Jianqing]’s face changed, and he turned his head to ask.
0:33:49|0:33:54|Lin Jianqing impatiently extended his right hand to smell under his nose, then handed it to Fang Xiaoxiao.
0:34:4|0:34:10|[Lin Jianqing] clicked the mouse to tease [Fang Xiaoxiao] on purpose, but [Fang Xiaoxiao] ended up laughing at him.
0:34:10|0:34:18|At night, the night light on the bedside table cast a soft glow, as the two of them lay on their respective beds, both staring blankly with their eyes open.
0:34:18|0:34:26|[Fang Xiaoxiao] suddenly sat up, leaning half of her body out, with her hands propped on [Lin Jianqing]'s bed, looking at him earnestly.
0:34:26|0:34:35|[Lin Jianqing] immediately closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep when he heard any movement. When [Fang Xiaoxiao] spoke, [Lin Jianqing] pretended not to hear, ignoring her completely.
0:34:44|0:34:51|[Lin Jianqing] couldn't help but join in the conversation.
0:34:57|0:35:10|[Fang Xiaoxiao] saw the situation and stopped asking questions. She got up and returned to the bed. At this moment, there was a strange noise coming from upstairs. [Lin Jianqing] handed the Walkman to [Fang Xiaoxiao], who didn't take it, and instead lay down on the bed and shouted.
0:35:59|0:36:15|The underground passage became more crowded, with people coming and going in a hurry. [Fang Xiaoxiao], wearing a thick coat and carrying a backpack, suddenly appeared in the underground passage. She held a new phone in her hand and waved it at [Lin Jianqing]. She opened the phone's camera, leaned against [Lin Jianqing], and smiled to herself.
0:36:23|0:36:28|[Fang Xiaoxiao] turned around excitedly and ran to a nearby wall to squat down, then called [Lin Jianqing].
0:36:28|0:36:34|Lin Jianqing took the call with a helpless expression on his face.
0:36:48|0:36:54|[Fang Xiaoxiao] was stunned, she paused for a moment, raised her eyebrows in disbelief, and stood up.
0:36:56|0:37:0|[Fang Xiaoxiao] put down her phone and returned to [Lin Jianqing]'s stall, squatting down against the wall.
0:37:0|0:37:7|She couldn't help but laugh as she looked at [Lin Jianqing], who was staring intently at [Fang Xiaoxiao], trying to figure something out.
0:37:7|0:37:14|[Fang Xiaoxiao] pretended to smile lightly to hide her inner sadness, while [Lin Jianqing] started packing without saying a word.
0:37:15|0:37:23|[Lin Jianqing] slung the backpack over his shoulder and said. [Fang Xiaoxiao] didn't react immediately, looking puzzled as he helped [Lin Jianqing] pack up their things together.
0:37:24|0:37:31|In the evening, Lin Jianqing and Fang Xiaoxiao arrived at a shopping mall. The lobby was decorated with beautiful balloons and colorful lights, surrounded by a large crowd of people, all dressed in festive attire.
0:37:31|0:37:34|Everyone is wearing deer antlers on their heads and holding glow sticks in their hands.
0:37:48|0:38:3|Fang Xiaoxiao's smile disappeared instantly as his boyfriend appeared on the screen, holding hands with another woman, the two of them intimately making a heart shape towards the camera, pushing a baby stroller. The family of three looked harmonious and happy. Fang Xiaoxiao's expression turned anxious as he watched.
0:38:3|0:38:12|Gradually realizing that she used to be a clown, she stared blankly ahead, at a loss. [Lin Jianqing] looked at her with great distress.
0:38:12|0:38:15|Lin Jianqing yanked off her wig.
0:38:16|0:38:25|[Lin Jianqing] looked at [Fang Xiaoxiao] with a sense of grievance, reproach, and tenderness in his eyes. [Fang Xiaoxiao] looked at [Lin Jianqing] like a child who had done something wrong, holding back tears.
0:38:25|0:38:32|[Lin Jianqing] put on the wig, carefully tucking the stray hair behind the ear, and the two of them smiled at each other.
0:38:33|0:38:37|[Lin Jianqing] patted [Fang Xiaoxiao]'s shoulder to comfort her, and then the two of them left.
0:38:37|0:38:45|The two returned to the rental house, where the table was filled with various delicious foods and beer. They drank and played games together.
0:38:49|0:38:54|They were drinking with flushed faces, each holding a cigarette, forcing themselves to laugh heartily.
0:38:54|0:39:4|[Lin Jianqing] suddenly reached out and tousled [Fang Xiaoxiao]'s hair, making it messy. After drinking, both of them got drunk and vented their emotions in the room with music playing.
0:39:4|0:39:7|[Fang Xiaoxiao] jumps around with a blanket, swaying her head and body to the rhythm.
0:39:29|0:39:35|The two sat facing each other, and [Lin Jianqing] patted his chest.
0:40:1|0:40:7|[Fang Xiaoxiao] paused for a moment and said.
0:40:14|0:40:21|[Fang Xiaoxiao] grinned widely and looked at the bowed head of [Lin Jianqing].
0:40:24|0:40:31|[Lin Jianqing] nodded slightly with his head down. [Fang Xiaoxiao] sighed and shook her head.
0:40:31|0:40:38|[Lin Jianqing] smiled bitterly and nodded, suddenly remembering the New Year countdown outside. [Lin Jianqing] looked up.
0:40:49|0:40:56|Outside was bustling with excitement, fireworks lit up the sky, and the sound of people filled the air.
0:40:56|0:41:0|Inside the room, Lin Jianqing and Fang Xiaoxiao were tightly embracing each other, comforting one another.
0:41:0|0:41:6|The smiles on their faces were gradually consumed by pain, frowning tightly as they tried hard to forget.
0:41:6|0:41:11|After a long time, [Fang Xiaoxiao] let go of [Lin Jianqing]'s hand on her own initiative, lowered her head and stopped looking at him.
0:41:11|0:41:18|[Lin Jianqing] was still immersed in it, hesitated for a moment before slowly putting his hand down, reluctant to look at [Fang Xiaoxiao].
0:41:18|0:41:24|The reluctance in his eyes gradually disappeared, replaced by determination, as he decided to no longer be timid.
0:41:26|0:41:32|Fang Xiaoxiao saw his intention, pushed away his face as he leaned in, and then unexpectedly wrapped her arms around Lin Jianqing's neck and kissed him.
0:42:37|0:42:42|Early the next morning, [Lin Jianqing] got up and rushed out onto the street, just to buy breakfast for [Fang Xiaoxiao].
0:42:42|0:42:51|He came back excitedly with breakfast, but carefully pushed open the door, afraid of waking up [Fang Xiaoxiao]. However, when he opened the door, [Lin Jianqing] froze.
0:42:51|0:43:8|Standing at the door, looking at the empty room, feeling lost, he held the breakfast that he was worried would get cold, placed it on the table. Then, [Lin Jianqing] sat on the edge of the bed and expressionlessly called [Fang Xiaoxiao], but there was no answer. By noon, there was still no news from [Fang Xiaoxiao].
0:43:8|0:43:16|[Lin Jianqing] sat in front of the computer desk, absentmindedly playing games while constantly trying to contact [Fang Xiaoxiao]. In the evening, [Fang Xiaoxiao] finally answered the phone.
0:43:36|0:43:42|[Fang Xiaoxiao] stood in the restroom of the KTV, speaking indifferently. [Fang Xiaoxiao] said calmly.
0:43:42|0:43:50|On the other end of the phone, [Lin Jianqing] was stunned, and the scene then shifted to a hotel room at the airport in 2018.
0:45:23|0:45:29|The two people reminisced about the past and laughed together, as if in an instant they had truly returned to the past.
0:45:29|0:45:40|So when their thoughts returned to reality, the two of them were left with endless silence. They looked at each other but couldn't smile anymore, their faces showing the sadness that was hard to conceal.
0:45:40|0:45:46|They clearly understood that there was no turning back, but both of them obviously had not let go of their feelings for each other.
0:45:46|0:45:57|The longing in their eyes slowly faded, replaced by a sense of loneliness after facing reality. Tears welled up in Lin Jianqing's eyes, filled with unwillingness and reluctance.
0:45:57|0:46:4|[Fang Xiaoxiao] lowered her head first, followed by [Lin Jianqing], and the scene shifted back to 2008.
0:46:10|0:46:13|Fang Xiaoxiao returned to the rental house but did not see Lin Jianqing.
0:46:44|0:47:0|She came to the detention center to look for [Lin Jianqing], but was turned away by the staff. The door closed, but [Fang Xiaoxiao] did not leave. She stood at the door for a long time, unable to snap out of it. Then she turned and walked away, slowly approaching not far from the gate. She turned around again, staring blankly at the gate of the detention center.
0:47:0|0:47:6|On New Year's Eve, [Fang Xiaoxiao] returned to her hometown and sat with [Lin Jianqing]'s family to have the reunion dinner.
0:48:26|0:48:33|Lin's Father silently returned to the kitchen to clean up the dishes and chopsticks.
0:48:33|0:48:40|[Fang Xiaoxiao] is helping on the side.
0:49:46|0:49:54|Lin's Father prepared chili sauce in the jar while talking.
0:49:55|0:49:57|[Fang Xiaoxiao] stood silently on the side.
0:49:57|0:50:1|She lowered her head, unable to maintain the fake smile she had worn all day at this moment.
0:50:1|0:50:6|She dared not answer Lin's Father's question, but she also didn't want to lie and deceive again.
0:50:6|0:50:9|At night, Lin Jianqing escorted Fang Xiaoxiao out.
0:50:9|0:50:19|[Ma Dongmei] handed a pile of delicious food to [Fang Xiaoxiao]. [Lin Jianqing] endured the whole night.
0:50:19|0:50:27|Finally unable to resist, [Fang Xiaoxiao] inquired about the recent situation of [Lin Jianqing]. However, [Fang Xiaoxiao] quickly dodged the question and hurriedly left as if escaping.
0:50:27|0:50:43|[Lin's Father] stood still, looking at the back of [Fang Xiaoxiao] with a pensive expression. He could tell that [Fang Xiaoxiao] was deliberately hiding something, knowing deep down that his son must not be doing well. However, he chose not to inquire further. [Fang Xiaoxiao] quickly walked towards home, unable to hold back her tears.
0:50:43|0:50:51|She was afraid that Lin's Father would see through something, so she kept everything hidden in her heart and endured it alone. The forced smile all night made Fang Xiaoxiao feel very suppressed.
0:50:51|0:50:53|At this moment, she could finally cry out loud.
0:50:53|0:51:3|[Lin's Father] sat by the stove, placing the peeled walnuts by the fire, but the person who ate the walnuts did not show up. In the blink of an eye, it was the day when [Lin Jianqing] was released from prison.
0:51:3|0:51:10|[Fang Xiaoxiao] was waiting outside the detention center early. The staff opened the door, and [Lin Jianqing] walked out with a bag.
0:51:10|0:51:14|He ignored [Fang Xiaoxiao] standing at the door and walked straight to the side.
0:51:14|0:51:23|[Fang Xiaoxiao] hugged her frozen body and ran after [Lin Jianqing], handing a package to [Lin Jianqing].
0:52:27|0:52:42|[Lin Jianqing] had just finished speaking when [Fang Xiaoxiao] grabbed his head and kissed him, then let go and took two steps back, looking at the still dazed [Lin Jianqing] with a mischievous smile. [Lin Jianqing] stood there, unsure of what to do.
0:52:54|0:53:0|[Lin Jianqing] smiled and walked away without answering her, leaving [Fang Xiaoxiao] in disbelief as she grabbed [Lin Jianqing].
0:53:4|0:53:7|[Fang Xiaoxiao] pretended to be angry, but found [Lin Jianqing] indifferent.
0:53:7|0:53:13|She immediately turned and ran forward, and Lin Jianqing smiled and hugged Fang Xiaoxiao from behind.
0:53:13|0:53:19|He laughed like a child, as if he had received a priceless treasure, and ran forward holding hands with [Fang Xiaoxiao].
0:53:19|0:53:27|The two of them naturally came together like this. They were like most couples in love, sticking together every day.
0:53:27|0:53:32|They embraced each other on the subway, reluctant to part when they arrived at the station. The weather was getting warmer.
0:53:32|0:53:45|[Lin Jianqing] rode a bicycle with [Fang Xiaoxiao] sitting on the handlebars, looking at [Lin Jianqing]. The two of them laughed as they rode along a path through the woods, even the kites in the sky were paired up.
0:53:47|0:53:54|[Lin Jianqing] is earnestly designing sketches for his gaming dream.
0:53:57|0:54:3|[Fang Xiaoxiao] lay on the bed, flipping through [Lin Jianqing]'s draft sketches page by page.
0:54:14|0:54:21|[Lin Jianqing] was leaning on the table, drawing and speaking. [Lin Jianqing] continued speaking without even looking back.
0:54:21|0:54:28|[Fang Xiaoxiao] sat up from the bed after reading the draft, looking serious. [Fang Xiaoxiao] smirked cunningly.
0:54:28|0:54:33|[Lin Jianqing] smiled and rushed over when he saw the situation.
0:54:50|0:54:55|As soon as the words fell, the scene shifted to 2018, the colorless world in [Lin Jianqing]'s mouth.
0:54:55|0:54:59|[Fang Xiaoxiao] stood in front of the bathroom mirror, carefully grooming herself.
0:54:59|0:55:9|She suddenly woke up. Realizing her mistaken thoughts, she forced herself to sober up and fell silent for a long time.
0:55:9|0:55:17|She reached out and took off the earring on her ear, regaining her composure. She looked at herself in the mirror, no longer fantasizing about those unrealistic things.
0:55:17|0:55:25|She pushed open the door of the bathroom and walked out, with Lin Jianqing lying on one side of the bed, while Fang Xiaoxiao sat on the other side, saying.
0:55:26|0:55:35|[Lin Jianqing] looked at her, guessing her intentions, hesitated for a moment, and then reached out his hand. [Lin Jianqing] smiled, understanding Xiaoxiao's meaning.
0:55:35|0:55:42|Extending his other hand, [Fang Xiaoxiao] leaned forward to smell it, then lifted his arm to smell his own hand and said.
0:55:44|0:55:49|[Fang Xiaoxiao] leaned against the pillow, looked up at the ceiling and smiled. At that moment, [Lin Jianqing]'s phone rang.
0:55:49|0:55:53|[Lin Jianqing] glanced at Xiaoxiao, then answered the video call with a smile.
0:57:4|0:57:13|[Lin Jianqing] hung up the phone, only to find that Xiaoxiao had closed the door and gone out. He immediately got up and opened the door to search, but found the hallway empty.
0:57:13|0:57:19|He looked around unwillingly, made sure Xiaoxiao had left, then turned back to the room.
0:57:19|0:57:22|He walked straight to the window, trying to find Fang Xiaoxiao's figure.
0:57:22|0:57:27|Outside the window is a vast expanse of white, with ice and snow, illuminating the night brightly and cleanly.
0:57:27|0:57:33|[Lin Jianqing] bent down and fixed his gaze, only to see Xiaoxiao standing in the snow waving her hands towards him.
0:57:33|0:57:40|The scene shifts to a particularly cold night in winter in Beijing in 2008.
0:57:42|0:57:52|[Fang Xiaoxiao] and [Lin Jianqing] are standing by the roadside waiting for the last bus. [Fang Xiaoxiao] reaches around from behind and hugs [Lin Jianqing] around the waist. [Lin Jianqing] smiles, then turns around and pulls her into his arms, affectionately patting her head.
0:57:52|0:58:4|Lin Jianqing then lifted Fang Xiaoxiao's arm and placed her on the roadside railing. Fang Xiaoxiao pretended that she wasn't sitting steadily, leaning her body backwards and swinging her legs in the air.
0:58:12|0:58:19|[Lin Jianqing] looked up at [Fang Xiaoxiao], feeling both heartache and guilt as he hugged her tightly, the two of them embracing each other closely.
0:58:19|0:58:28|[Fang Xiaoxiao] smiled happily and said, holding [Lin Jianqing] even tighter. [Lin Jianqing] looked puzzled.
0:58:44|0:58:52|Watching [Fang Xiaoxiao] in silence for a moment, he smiled and lifted her down from the railing.
0:58:59|0:59:5|[Lin Jianqing] insisted on taking a taxi home, so the two of them excitedly stood by the roadside waving at passing taxis.
0:59:17|0:59:25|[Fang Xiaoxiao] leaned half of her body out of the car window, shouting wildly outside, while [Lin Jianqing] stood beside her, both amused and worried, pulling her back.
0:59:25|0:59:28|The two of them cuddled together, envisioning the future.
0:59:44|0:59:51|[Lin Jianqing] took a job as a telephone customer service representative to make a living, while [Fang Xiaoxiao] joined a real estate company and was bullied everywhere.
1:0:1|1:0:17|Eating a bowl of instant noodles together can also be enjoyable. During the day, Fang Xiaoxiao sneaks into the corridor to secretly contact [Lin Jianqing]. The sweetness of love envelops the two of them. Even if the work is tough and tiring, receiving an encouraging message from each other can instantly relieve all exhaustion.
1:0:17|1:0:24|The two of them, in different places, but with the same smile on their faces, as if the other was right in front of them.
1:0:27|1:0:41|One day, Lin Jianqing received a call from Fang Xiaoxiao and hurried back home, only to find Fang Xiaoxiao lying on an old discarded sofa. Lin Jianqing glanced at Fang Xiaoxiao, turned and walked towards home, with Fang Xiaoxiao quickly following.
1:0:44|1:0:50|[Fang Xiaoxiao] was lying on the old sofa, staring at [Lin Jianqing] without moving, while [Lin Jianqing] remained unmoved by [Fang Xiaoxiao]'s coquetry.
1:0:50|1:0:55|Pulling her hand, she pulled her down, [Fang Xiaoxiao] hugged [Lin Jianqing]'s neck.
1:0:58|1:1:5|[Fang Xiaoxiao] propped one leg on the sofa, unwilling to leave, holding onto [Lin Jianqing], pouting and acting coquettishly. Helpless, [Lin Jianqing] eventually agreed.
1:1:16|1:1:24|[Lin Jianqing] lifts [Fang Xiaoxiao] up from the sofa and sits on the bed with her. He then closes the door.
1:2:31|1:2:39|[Fang Xiaoxiao] hooked her arm around [Lin Jianqing]'s neck and looked up, saying. The scene then shifted to 2018.
1:2:39|1:2:49|[Fang Xiaoxiao] wrapped herself tightly, wearing a woolen hat, sitting in the snow. [Lin Jianqing] sat not far from her, drinking from a bottle of liquor with a troubled expression.
1:3:20|1:3:28|[Lin Jianqing] looked at [Fang Xiaoxiao] in disbelief, [Fang Xiaoxiao] showed a sad expression, then suddenly burst into laughter.
1:3:40|1:3:46|The two stood up and walked down the steps.
1:3:46|1:3:51|[Fang Xiaoxiao] drinks the last sip of alcohol from the bottle.
1:4:14|1:4:16|After Fang Xiaoxiao finished speaking, the two fell silent again.
1:4:17|1:4:25|The scene shifts back to the past, approaching the Spring Festival of 2009. [Lin Jianqing] is driving with [Fang Xiaoxiao] sitting in the passenger seat, both humming a song.
1:6:56|1:6:58|[Zheng Huan] put his arm around [Lin Jianqing]'s shoulder and earnestly advised him.
1:6:59|1:7:3|This well-intentioned gesture, however, tore apart the dignity that [Lin Jianqing] had carefully protected all along.
1:7:3|1:7:14|Returning home, Lin's Father was busy in the kitchen, ladling soup into bowls. He turned around, pushed the door open, and said to Lin Jianqing. Lin's Father handed the bowl to Lin Jianqing.
1:7:18|1:7:25|[Lin Jianqing] squatted on the ground without saying a word, while [Fang Xiaoxiao] took over [Lin's Father]'s bowl beside him.
1:7:27|1:7:34|[Lin's Father] sat up straight, [Lin Jianqing] frowned but didn't say anything.
1:7:36|1:7:41|[Lin Jianqing] had red eyes, showing a painful and helpless expression.
1:7:41|1:7:50|He stood up, holding back tears, leaning on the pile of firewood beside him, and let out a deep sigh. He shook off Fang Xiaoxiao's hand.
1:7:51|1:7:58|As she spoke, she opened the door and walked out, [Fang Xiaoxiao] stood still in place.
1:8:2|1:8:8|[Lin's Father] showed no emotion, turned around and walked into the kitchen, while [Fang Xiaoxiao] and [Lin Jianqing] were getting ready to return to Beijing.
1:8:8|1:8:14|[Fang Xiaoxiao] is driving the car, with [Lin Jianqing] sitting in the passenger seat with his eyes closed. [Fang Xiaoxiao] pats his shoulder, comforting him.
1:8:17|1:8:24|[Lin Jianqing] opened his eyes but still looked drunk.
1:8:36|1:8:43|[Lin Jianqing] tightly closed his eyes in pain and said.
1:9:17|1:9:20|[Fang Xiaoxiao] finally couldn't control her emotions and couldn't help but explode.
1:9:20|1:9:26|[Lin Jianqing] had nothing to say, turned his head to the other side, and tears uncontrollably streamed down his face.
1:9:26|1:9:32|[Fang Xiaoxiao] also cried, she really doesn't care anymore whether [Lin Jianqing] can give her the stable life she wants.
1:9:32|1:9:37|From the moment they were together, Lin Jianqing's dream became her dream.
1:9:37|1:9:42|Lin Jianqing didn't understand, he just reached out to help Fang Xiaoxiao wipe away her tears.
1:9:47|1:9:54|[Lin Jianqing] is trapped in his wounded pride, stubbornly believing that he is useless, and gradually begins to deteriorate.
1:10:23|1:10:30|At this moment, a slender man in sunglasses walked into Lin Jianqing's company and carefully spoke to the receptionist.
1:10:35|1:10:40|A man comes to the customer service department looking for someone.
1:10:40|1:10:47|[Lin Jianqing] took off his headphones and stood up, the man took off his sunglasses and cursed.
1:11:0|1:11:8|On the table beside them, two men were drinking, with one comforting the other who was heartbroken. [Fang Xiaoxiao] and [Lin Jianqing] both looked gloomy, ignoring each other as they sat quietly.
1:11:8|1:11:17|The sound of traffic on the surrounding streets and the noise from the next table made the silence between Lin Jianqing and Fang Xiaoxiao even more pronounced.
1:11:24|1:11:28|[Lin Jianqing] noticed that [Fang Xiaoxiao] kept looking back at the man at the next table, so he sarcastically asked.
1:11:28|1:11:37|[Fang Xiaoxiao] gritted her teeth and said. [Fang Xiaoxiao] packed up her things to leave on her own, while [Lin Jianqing] remained seated, turning his head to look at the next table.
1:11:44|1:11:49|At this moment, [Lin Jianqing] suddenly rushed forward as if going crazy, kicking the man at the next table to the ground.
1:11:49|1:11:53|The people around screamed and fled, as three people wrestled together.
1:11:53|1:12:1|[Fang Xiaoxiao] looked at the chaos in front of her, she broke down, grabbed the bottle of alcohol on the table and took a few big gulps, then smashed the bottle and charged forward.
1:12:12|1:12:21|[Lin Jianqing] was pushed to the ground by [Fang Xiaoxiao]. He sat motionless against the wall, looking like he had lost his soul, and the scene of his madness had disappeared without a trace.
1:12:21|1:12:29|Gradually regaining their senses, the two sat on the bus in silence. [Lin Jianqing] rested his head against the window, while [Fang Xiaoxiao] stared into space.
1:12:29|1:12:33|The sweetness between the two has been completely worn away.
1:12:33|1:12:47|[Lin Jianqing] was tortured by life, making his personality even more eccentric. He argued with customers as a customer service representative, and then, after being beaten up by a customer and taking it out on an innocent passerby, [Fang Xiaoxiao] could no longer cry at the sight of this [Lin Jianqing].
1:12:47|1:12:50|She felt increasingly overwhelmed and could only work desperately.
1:13:8|1:13:16|A male customer made advances towards [Fang Xiaoxiao], getting closer to her and even putting his hand on her shoulder. [Fang Xiaoxiao] pushed him away and quickly fled.
1:13:24|1:13:31|[Lin Jianqing] returned to the room from the bathroom with a basin in his arms, [Fang Xiaoxiao] was half lying on the small sofa, and [Lin Jianqing] sat in front of the computer desk.
1:14:3|1:14:11|[Fang Xiaoxiao] looked at [Lin Jianqing] coldly, wanting a reasonable explanation, but [Lin Jianqing] didn't know how to respond and stood up, turning his back to [Fang Xiaoxiao].
1:14:11|1:14:18|[Fang Xiaoxiao] looked at [Lin Jianqing] with disappointment and looked away, no longer asking. [Lin Jianqing]'s silence had already given her the answer.
1:14:18|1:14:26|It was not the answer she wanted. At this moment, Lin Jianqing's phone rang, breaking the silence.
1:14:31|1:14:35|The landlord drove them away with a harsh tone, leaving no room for negotiation.
1:14:35|1:14:45|[Fang Xiaoxiao] showed no reaction upon hearing this, still staring blankly on the sofa. [Lin Jianqing] lit a cigarette without saying a word, and threw the phone heavily on the table.
1:14:45|1:14:53|One wave had not subsided before another rose, and the two spent a year in endless cold war. Life tortured Lin Jianqing more and more decadent.
1:14:53|1:14:56|He is tormenting [Fang Xiaoxiao] with this emotion again.
1:14:56|1:15:5|A year has passed in the blink of an eye, and it's New Year's Eve in 2010. However, this year neither of them went home for the holiday. Instead, they were forced to move out under the pressure of the landlord.
1:15:5|1:15:13|[Lin Jianqing] moved the luggage one by one onto the roadside tricycle, then patted the packed luggage on the tricycle to make sure everything was securely tied.
1:15:13|1:15:25|[Fang Xiaoxiao] stood on the side holding a package and staring blankly. [Lin Jianqing] approached and gently pushed [Fang Xiaoxiao]. The two of them sat down behind the tricycle, and [Lin Jianqing] looped his arm through the hemp rope used to tie luggage.
1:15:27|1:15:35|The tricycle started to sway as it moved, with the luggage piled high on it teetering dangerously. [Lin Jianqing] extended his arm to shield [Fang Xiaoxiao] from falling off.
1:15:36|1:15:55|The tricycle went further and further away, the small sofa that was once treasured by [Fang Xiaoxiao] was left behind, [Fang Xiaoxiao] had begged [Lin Jianqing] hard to bring it back home, but now it was casually abandoned by the roadside, just like their love left in that rented room and could no longer be taken away.
1:15:55|1:16:3|Soon the two of them moved into a basement house, where they could see the bustling footsteps and faint sunlight on the ground through the window.
1:16:3|1:16:16|[Fang Xiaoxiao] stood in front of the window, staring blankly. Suddenly, she saw a wild flower growing by the roadside outside the window. The small flower swayed its delicate body in the sunlight and breeze, appearing fragile but full of vitality.
1:16:16|1:16:33|[Lin Jianqing] moved the luggage into the house one by one, sitting at the door watching the back of [Fang Xiaoxiao]. His eyes were filled with timidity, inferiority, pain, and grievance, not daring to speak to [Fang Xiaoxiao]. The sound of fireworks outside the window could be heard, as people began to welcome the new year, creating a lively atmosphere.
1:16:33|1:16:40|However, in Lin Jianqing and Fang Xiaoxiao's room, it was cold and quiet. Fang Xiaoxiao sat on the bed, staring out the window.
1:16:40|1:16:45|[Lin Jianqing] is frantically playing games at the computer desk, avoiding reality.
1:16:58|1:17:6|Passes the phone to Lin Jianqing, who is playing games. Lin Jianqing glances at the phone and takes off the earphones.
1:17:46|1:17:54|[Lin Jianqing] paused for a moment and said, "Both father and son are insincere, pretending that they are doing well."
1:17:54|1:18:0|Lin's Father felt a pang in his heart when he heard his son's greeting. Reluctantly, he hung up the phone and returned to the dining table.
1:18:10|1:18:18|On the morning of the first day of the lunar new year, there was no one on the streets of Beijing. [Lin Jianqing] and [Fang Xiaoxiao] walked on the road, with a distance of nearly two meters between them.
1:18:18|1:18:29|[Lin Jianqing] wrapped half of his face with a scarf, with his hands in his pockets, walking silently. The two of them seemed like two walking corpses, with no communication or physical contact.
1:18:29|1:18:40|The two then sat on the city wall, with the Forbidden City's red walls and yellow tiles in front of them. [Lin Jianqing] did not respond.
1:18:40|1:18:49|The two fell into silence again, as if falling into an ice cave. That night, they returned to the rental room, with [Fang Xiaoxiao] expressionlessly eating instant noodles leaning on the table.
1:18:49|1:18:57|[Lin Jianqing] was still sitting in front of the computer desk playing games, [Fang Xiaoxiao] stopped the chopsticks in her hand and said. [Lin Jianqing] was wearing headphones.
1:18:57|1:19:5|The sound of gunfire in the game came through the headphones, deafening. He couldn't hear [Fang Xiaoxiao] speaking, only focused on frantically clicking the mouse.
1:19:5|1:19:13|[Fang Xiaoxiao] covered the remaining noodles, picked up a jar, and poured the remaining sauce inside into the lid.
1:19:16|1:19:31|[Fang Xiaoxiao] mustered up the courage to say these words, but her voice kept trembling. She knew that [Lin Jianqing] couldn't hear her, and she didn't expect a response. Then she stood up, turned around, walked to the side of the bed, reached out and picked up the hat on the bed, slowly put it on her head, and tidied her hair.
1:19:31|1:19:40|She then picked up the backpack that had been packed up earlier, put it on her back, took the scarf from the shelf, turned around and walked to [Lin Jianqing]'s side, saying.
1:19:40|1:19:49|[Lin Jianqing] turned a deaf ear, ignoring her, and continued playing the game. [Fang Xiaoxiao] held onto the last glimmer of hope.
1:19:49|1:19:56|Wanting to get a response from [Lin Jianqing], but his refusal to communicate extinguished this last hope.
1:19:56|1:20:3|The light in [Fang Xiaoxiao]'s eyes disappeared in an instant, her gaze became resolute, and she left without hesitation.
1:20:3|1:20:12|[Lin Jianqing] stopped what he was doing when he heard a noise, turned his head to look towards the door, thinking that [Fang Xiaoxiao] had just gone out and would be back soon. He then turned back and continued playing the game.
1:20:12|1:20:18|He then realized something was wrong, turned around to look at the door again, only to find that [Fang Xiaoxiao] had disappeared without a trace.
1:20:18|1:20:28|He realized that [Fang Xiaoxiao] had really left, so he immediately took off his headphones and ran after her, knocking over the chair next to the computer in his haste.
1:20:28|1:20:38|Fang Xiaoxiao's half-bowl of noodles almost had its lid knocked off by Lin Jianqing as he ran past the clothes hanging in the hallway.
1:20:38|1:20:52|On the first day of the lunar new year, with few people in the subway station, [Lin Jianqing] ran wildly to open the curtain of the subway station door, looking around for the figure of [Fang Xiaoxiao]. He tried to swipe the ticket several times but couldn't get through, so he violently pushed open the gate and ran in.
1:20:52|1:20:58|He ran down the stairs panting, anxiously looking at the empty subway car. The subway was about to depart.
1:20:58|1:21:7|[Lin Jianqing] searched for [Fang Xiaoxiao] from one train car to another outside the carriage, running frantically and looking into the adjacent cars, until he finally saw [Fang Xiaoxiao] in one of the cars.
1:21:7|1:21:14|He stood outside the car door, took a deep breath, and looked at [Fang Xiaoxiao] with a gasp. [Fang Xiaoxiao] had red eyes, with a look of despair in her eyes.
1:21:14|1:21:30|Upon seeing [Lin Jianqing], a hint of imperceptible joy flashed in her eyes. As the subway doors slowly closed, [Fang Xiaoxiao] looked ashen-faced, devoid of any emotion in her eyes. She stared blankly at the man she had loved for two years, and in that instant, her heart died.
1:21:30|1:21:35|The train started moving, and [Fang Xiaoxiao] shifted her gaze away like a stranger.
1:21:35|1:21:42|[Lin Jianqing] stared at [Fang Xiaoxiao], took two steps forward with the train, unable to believe that [Fang Xiaoxiao] had left him like this.
1:21:42|1:21:49|[Fang Xiaoxiao] glanced back at [Lin Jianqing] once again, the train quickly departed, and [Lin Jianqing] never found the courage to step into the carriage.
1:21:49|1:21:56|His hesitation and timidity caused him to completely lose [Fang Xiaoxiao], standing in place for a long time unable to regain his composure.
1:22:5|1:22:14|To reminisce about the missed love.
1:22:15|1:22:21|[Lin Jianqing] frowned and then continued speaking.
1:22:26|1:22:33|[Lin Jianqing] looked up, imagining what could have been between them.
1:22:36|1:22:42|[Lin Jianqing] paused for a moment, then smiled and turned to walk forward, with [Fang Xiaoxiao] following closely behind.
1:22:42|1:22:46|Lin Jianqing said again, unwillingly.
1:22:56|1:23:5|[Lin Jianqing] was determined to get an original copy of the book. However, [Fang Xiaoxiao]'s response left him speechless.
1:23:5|1:23:13|He pondered for a moment and sighed. He stared at [Fang Xiaoxiao] with a sense of helplessness and regret in his voice.
1:23:13|1:23:19|[Fang Xiaoxiao] looked at him and said. As soon as she finished speaking,
1:23:20|1:23:34|In a prolonged silence, [Lin Jianqing] gradually felt his eyes moisten as he was deeply hurt by [Fang Xiaoxiao]'s words. He frowned and looked at [Fang Xiaoxiao], whose eyes were also filled with tears, no longer avoiding true emotions as before.
1:23:34|1:23:47|[Lin Jianqing], unable to restrain his emotions any longer, suddenly stepped forward, grabbed [Fang Xiaoxiao]'s hand, and the two of them ran wildly in the snow, as if they had returned to the past, ignoring everything. They returned to the hotel and pushed open the door.
1:23:49|1:23:57|The two stopped. The man noticed [Fang Xiaoxiao] standing beside them.
1:24:2|1:24:10|The man walked with a girl, looking at [Lin Jianqing] with understanding. The girl beside the man avoided eye contact, obviously not his wife.
1:24:10|1:24:18|The man mistakenly thought that Lin Jianqing and Fang Xiaoxiao were also in that kind of relationship, so he warmly greeted them. Fang Xiaoxiao let go of Lin Jianqing's hand and said.
1:24:20|1:24:28|[Lin Jianqing] also felt very embarrassed. He regained his composure, nodded slightly, and said.
1:24:31|1:24:37|[Fang Xiaoxiao] didn't look at him, then the two of them rented a car and sat in the front row laughing together.
1:26:21|1:26:28|He sniffed, looked away, sighed deeply. He didn't expect that in the end, they would still lose to reality.
1:26:32|1:26:37|[Fang Xiaoxiao] suddenly leaned over and kept calling out to [Lin Jianqing], looking at him with wide eyes.
1:26:37|1:26:44|[Fang Xiaoxiao] said these words seriously, and [Lin Jianqing]'s voice started to tremble.
1:26:51|1:26:58|With tears streaming down his face, Lin Jianqing forced a smile, looked at Fang Xiaoxiao, nodded gently, and tears kept flowing out.
1:26:58|1:27:3|[Fang Xiaoxiao] felt extremely wronged, her nose tingling as she pouted.
1:27:5|1:27:9|Lin Jianqing empathized and could only close his eyes and turn his head away.
1:27:9|1:27:25|[Fang Xiaoxiao] cried like a child, tightly closing her eyes, letting tears flow down her face.
1:27:35|1:27:42|[Lin Jianqing] furrowed his brows in pain, trying hard to restrain his impending emotional breakdown.
1:27:49|1:27:57|He turned his head to [Fang Xiaoxiao] to finish the sentence, but dared not look directly at [Fang Xiaoxiao]'s face, immediately shifting his gaze away.
1:27:57|1:28:3|[Fang Xiaoxiao] lowered her eyes, with countless tear marks on her face. She gathered up the courage and asked.
1:28:6|1:28:12|Lin Jianqing did not answer, but instead asked the same question.
1:28:12|1:28:17|This time he no longer avoids the gaze of [Fang Xiaoxiao], but stares into her eyes intently.
1:28:17|1:28:22|He looks like a beggar, his eyes filled with pleading, desperately seeking an answer.
1:28:25|1:28:42|Crying uncontrollably, [Lin Jianqing] reached out his arms and pulled [Fang Xiaoxiao], who was crying into a mess, into his embrace. He closed his eyes, tears streaming down his face as he kissed [Fang Xiaoxiao]'s head, unwilling to let go. [Fang Xiaoxiao] leaned against [Lin Jianqing]'s chest and cried freely, as if the two had returned to the past.
1:28:43|1:29:7|In 2010, having just lost [Fang Xiaoxiao], [Lin Jianqing] spent this incredibly long night alone. As the sky gradually brightened, the basement rental was particularly quiet, with only the dripping sound of a leaking water pipe. There was no heating in the room, so [Lin Jianqing] had to wear a cotton coat and wrap himself in a quilt. He stayed awake all night, staring blankly ahead, devoid of vitality.
1:29:7|1:29:21|He suddenly stood up, as if going crazy, and smashed everything on the shelf next to him to the ground. Then he turned around and overturned the night light and photo album on the table behind him. For a moment, the room was in a mess.
1:29:21|1:29:30|After venting his emotions, [Lin Jianqing] calmed down and let himself go, collapsing on the bed and lying in a straight line. After a while,
1:29:30|1:29:58|He sat up again, lit a cigarette, looked around while smoking, then extinguished the cigarette, squatted on the ground and tidied up the items he had messed up bit by bit. He made the bed neatly, the room was refreshed, he opened the window, the first ray of morning sunlight shone into the room, and outside the window came the chirping of birds. The small wild flower by the window grew more vigorously and brilliantly.
1:30:18|1:30:31|[Lin Jianqing] starts writing the story of Ian and Kelly again. At the end of the game, Ian doesn't find Kelly, and a line of text appears on the screen: "If you find Kelly, please tell her I'm sorry."
1:30:33|1:30:39|He recalled the words he had once said.
1:30:41|1:30:53|After the game ended, with Ian's failure, everything began to fall apart. The game interface turned gray, bats flew frantically in the sky, and Ian also fell into a deep abyss.
1:31:21|1:31:27|[Lin Jianqing] rode a motorcycle swiftly under the scorching sun, with a pile of express delivery packages tied behind him like a small mountain.
1:31:55|1:32:2|Until he saw this game entering every household, many people transformed into the little boy Ian, searching for his own Kelly in the game.
1:32:20|1:32:25|He was smoking and silently crying, he succeeded.
1:32:25|1:32:33|Alone without anyone to share his joy, he stared at the number for a long time, a tear that had been building up in the corner of his eye finally fell.
1:32:33|1:32:39|His efforts finally paid off, and he successfully gained the favor of a well-known company.
1:33:59|1:34:6|Two people were panting heavily, collapsing on the steps. After resting for a moment, [Lin Jianqing] picked up [Fang Xiaoxiao].
1:34:19|1:34:24|In the flashback, Lin Jianqing and Fang Xiaoxiao are riding bicycles, one in front of the other, speeding down the road.
1:34:26|1:34:42|On the TV screen, [Lin Jianqing] finished telling the story, his eyes looking at the camera filled with longing for the past. [Fang Xiaoxiao] looked at him, tears suddenly welling up in her eyes. With money now, [Lin Jianqing] was preparing to buy a house in Beijing.
1:35:10|1:35:17|The real estate agent enthusiastically introduced the house to [Lin Jianqing], who looked at her and momentarily thought he saw [Fang Xiaoxiao].
1:35:25|1:35:34|Suddenly attracted by the sight downstairs, on a tricycle parked below, there was the sofa that he and [Fang Xiaoxiao] had abandoned in the rental house.
1:35:34|1:35:42|The tricycle went further and further, disappearing from sight. [Lin Jianqing] hurried forward, wanting to see more clearly.
1:35:44|1:35:51|[Fang Xiaoxiao] had a busy day and finally it was time to get off work. Her colleagues left first, leaving [Fang Xiaoxiao] behind to tidy up the goods in the store and prepare to close.
1:35:51|1:36:0|Suddenly received a text message from [Lin Jianqing], asking if he would be coming home for the Chinese New Year this year. [Fang Xiaoxiao] was stunned for a long time, but ultimately ignored [Lin Jianqing].
1:36:0|1:36:9|Turning around and closing the shop door. She came out of the shop and walked in the corridor of the mall, and her phone started ringing again. [Lin Jianqing] asked her how she has been recently?
1:36:9|1:36:17|[Fang Xiaoxiao] still ignored him and went straight downstairs to get on her bike to go home. Just as she unlocked her bike, [Lin Jianqing] sent her another message.
1:36:17|1:36:26|[Lin Jianqing] tentatively asked: Shall we go back together? Then he said: My dad always asks about you, but I just can't bring myself to say it.
1:36:26|1:36:30|We broke up. [Fang Xiaoxiao] didn't say anything and rode away on her bicycle.
1:36:30|1:36:35|New Year's Eve in 2011 in the blink of an eye.
1:36:46|1:36:51|[Lin Jianqing] returned to his hometown and bought a new TV for the family, teaching [Lin's Father] how to use it step by step.
1:36:51|1:36:56|[Fang Xiaoxiao] is busy tidying up the dining table on the side.
1:39:16|1:39:21|Lin's Father stubbornly refused Lin Jianqing's kindness, so Lin Jianqing turned and walked out in anger.
1:39:21|1:39:26|[Fang Xiaoxiao] hurriedly followed, jogging to catch up with [Lin Jianqing].
1:40:2|1:40:13|[Lin Jianqing] hesitated to speak, finding it difficult to bring up the topic with [Fang Xiaoxiao], so he turned his head in frustration and said. After hanging his head in silence for a while, [Lin Jianqing] spoke up.
1:40:44|1:40:50|[Lin Jianqing] unwillingly chased after her, and when [Fang Xiaoxiao] heard this, she slowed down and turned around to speak.
1:40:52|1:40:59|[Fang Xiaoxiao] was angered by [Lin Jianqing]'s attitude and quickly walked away. [Lin Jianqing] realized he had said the wrong thing and hurried to catch up with [Fang Xiaoxiao].
1:40:59|1:41:9|[Fang Xiaoxiao] was forced to stop. She looked up at [Lin Jianqing] coldly, with a displeased expression.
1:41:9|1:41:15|[Lin Jianqing] spoke with his head down and in a low, pleading voice.
1:41:28|1:41:32|[Fang Xiaoxiao] looked at [Lin Jianqing] with a look of confusion and incomprehension in her eyes.
1:41:32|1:41:40|[Lin Jianqing] sighed and said, not knowing how to respond. He felt very powerless.
1:41:51|1:41:56|[Lin Jianqing] had tears in his eyes, wanting to beg for forgiveness from [Fang Xiaoxiao]. [Fang Xiaoxiao] took a deep breath and said.
1:41:56|1:42:6|[Fang Xiaoxiao] is determined not to forgive [Lin Jianqing] anymore, pouring cold water on him repeatedly, hoping to make him give up completely.
1:42:6|1:42:11|[Lin Jianqing] stood still, feeling helpless in the face of the indifferent [Fang Xiaoxiao].
1:42:11|1:42:15|[Fang Xiaoxiao] turned and walked away with a graceful stride, showing no hint of nostalgia.
1:42:15|1:42:20|At this moment, fireworks started to go off in all directions, their sound echoing through the sky.
1:42:20|1:42:28|[Lin Jianqing] stood still, his lonely figure looking particularly isolated. He gave up struggling and let [Fang Xiaoxiao] leave once again.
1:42:28|1:42:35|The scene shifts back to 2018, as the sky gradually brightens, the snowy suburbs are surrounded by silence.
1:42:35|1:42:43|In the distance, thick white smoke rises from the houses and factories. [Lin Jianqing] and [Fang Xiaoxiao] park the car in the snowy field and stand in front of the car.
1:42:43|1:42:49|Each of them holding a cigarette in their hands, they looked ahead with blank expressions and remained silent for a while.
1:42:50|1:42:58|The two of them chatted aimlessly, alleviating the loneliness of the journey.
1:43:18|1:43:23|[Lin Jianqing] returned to his hometown with his pregnant wife, and [Lin's Father] was already waiting at the train station.
1:43:27|1:43:33|Lin's Father, holding a white cane, his eyes gradually losing the ability to see people.
1:43:35|1:43:40|Lin's Father eagerly grabbed his daughter-in-law's hand, mistaking her for Fang Xiaoxiao, tears welling up in his eyes.
1:43:47|1:43:54|Lin Jianqing's wife was surprised to hear Lin's Father calling her Fang Xiaoxiao, then the two helped Lin's Father slowly leave the train station.
1:44:0|1:44:4|Lin Jianqing's mind returned to reality, feeling a mix of emotions, but showing no expression on his face, as the snow and ice on the road began to melt gradually.
1:44:4|1:44:13|The two set off again, the car speeding through the snowy landscape, as the sun gradually rose from the horizon, illuminating the vast white land.
1:44:36|1:44:44|[Fang Xiaoxiao] sat in the passenger seat, leaning her head against the seat, staring out the window in a daze. After a long silence, she finally spoke.
1:44:53|1:44:59|[Lin Jianqing] had nothing to say, so he forced a awkward smile, looked straight ahead, and remained silent.
1:44:59|1:45:4|The empty road was only accompanied by a lonely car speeding forward.
1:45:4|1:45:10|On both sides of the road are endless snowfields, connecting with the distant sky to form a world of ice and snow.
1:45:10|1:45:18|The car sped forward, passing through a snowy forest, and then arrived at the destination. The two arrived at the entrance of a residential area.
1:45:18|1:45:24|[Lin Jianqing] got off the car and opened the trunk, followed by [Fang Xiaoxiao], and the two of them took her luggage out of the car together.
1:45:25|1:45:33|[Lin Jianqing] helped [Fang Xiaoxiao] carry her suitcase to the entrance of the unit. [Fang Xiaoxiao] smiled and nodded, while [Lin Jianqing] turned around and left.
1:45:33|1:45:41|When he walked to the car, [Fang Xiaoxiao] suddenly chased after him. He turned around in confusion and then walked to [Fang Xiaoxiao] with a smile.
1:45:41|1:45:49|[Fang Xiaoxiao] also looked at [Lin Jianqing] with a smile in her eyes and said.
1:46:0|1:46:8|Fang Xiaoxiao's expression suddenly became melancholy. Lin Jianqing lowered his head and smiled, saying.
1:46:9|1:46:15|[Fang Xiaoxiao] looked at [Lin Jianqing] with a smile in her eyes, but sadness was hard to hide.
1:46:15|1:46:19|[Lin Jianqing] opened his arms and took a step forward to embrace [Fang Xiaoxiao].
1:46:19|1:46:24|The two embraced tightly, closing their eyes to savor this moment of luxury.
1:47:12|1:47:13|There was no communication between them.
1:47:13|1:47:25|[Lin Jianqing] returned home to sort out his father's belongings. He took out his father's photo from an iron box and held it in his hand, carefully examining it. Then he meticulously searched through the items in the box one by one.
1:47:25|1:47:30|Inside, besides stacks of recipes, there is also a letter written to [Fang Xiaoxiao].
1:47:40|1:47:45|[Lin Jianqing] busied himself in the nagging of his wife, placing the wrapped sticky rice dumplings into the steamer.
1:47:45|1:48:2|[Fang Xiaoxiao] The room is filled with delivery boxes from Beijing to Yaojiang, all addressed to Miss Fang. [Fang Xiaoxiao] sits at the table, under the desk lamp, taking out a train ticket from Beijing to Yaojiang town. Then, she skillfully stands on the chair and removes the light from the ceiling.
1:48:2|1:48:10|At this moment, the delivery man knocked on the door of [Fang Xiaoxiao].
1:48:10|1:48:16|[Fang Xiaoxiao] signed for a delivery, then she walked to the table and sat down with the package, which was an envelope.
1:48:16|1:48:26|She took out the folded letter from the envelope and opened it under the light to read.
1:50:0|1:50:9|[Lin Jianqing] sat by the stove where [Lin's Father] often sat, lost in thought.
1:50:39|1:50:42|[Fang Xiaoxiao] watched as tears silently rolled down her face.
1:50:42|1:50:48|On the lively night of Beijing's New Year, the wide streets were brightly lit on both sides.
1:50:48|1:50:52|The lights in the distance on the upper floor twinkle like stars in the sky.
1:50:52|1:50:57|Red lanterns are hung outside every household, with couplets and the character for "fortune" pasted on the doors.
1:50:57|1:51:13|[Fang Xiaoxiao] sat at the table, with Lin Jianqing's game on the computer screen. A large number of bullet comments appeared on the game interface, with countless netizens apologizing to the people they had missed in the past. [Fang Xiaoxiao] reached out her right hand and pressed the Enter key.
1:51:13|1:51:23|In the game, a young boy arrives at a snowy house, while on the other side of the road walks a young girl, who is the girl Ian has been looking for, Kelly.
1:51:23|1:51:49|Ian and Kelly finally reunite at the end of the road. They look at each other, leaning happily together, with long-lost smiles on their faces. In this moment, the game screen suddenly changes from gray to color. Fang Xiaoxiao looks at the computer screen, her eyes moistened, and a relieved smile appears on her face. At this moment, Fang Xiaoxiao's world finally regains its color.
1:51:49|1:51:56|Ian and Kelly walked side by side into the house, and a dazzling light shone from the door of the house, illuminating the surroundings.
1:51:56|1:52:4|The light splashed on the ground outside, instantly illuminating the whole world. At this moment, a line of text appeared on the screen,
