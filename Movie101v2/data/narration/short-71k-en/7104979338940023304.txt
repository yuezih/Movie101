0:3:40|0:3:44|On the other side, the female lead [Sha Lu] is wearing a pair of exquisite high heels.
0:3:57|0:4:2|The lawyer placed the agreement in front of [Sha Lu], who lowered his head to look at it.
0:4:21|0:4:30|The lawyer handed the pen on the table to [Sha Lu], who took it and signed his name, then the lawyer quickly put away the agreement.
0:4:38|0:4:40|The lawyer packed up the agreement and left with a smile.
0:4:40|0:4:45|On the other side, [Xiang Shaolong] was driving on the bustling street.
0:4:45|0:4:50|A deliveryman suddenly appeared in front, pulling a large basket of goods.
0:5:7|0:5:10|Daughter [Ah Hei] is lying on her back with a blank expression, wearing dirty overalls.
0:5:10|0:5:13|The two then arrived at the entrance of a restaurant.
0:5:15|0:5:19|[Xiang Shaolong] pushed aside the door curtain and walked in, followed by [Sha Lu].
0:5:19|0:5:23|He saw many guests burying their heads in their meals and was stunned for a moment.
0:6:38|0:6:43|[Xiang Shaolong] reached into his pocket, while [Sha Lu] stared straight at him.
0:6:43|0:6:49|He took out a tissue to wipe his mouth and continued eating heartily.
0:6:50|0:6:55|He took out a toothpick from the other pocket and shaved his teeth with it.
0:6:55|0:6:58|[Ahei] rolled his eyes.
0:7:8|0:7:10|On the other side, [Sha Lu] arrived at the hospital.
0:7:10|0:7:11|The scene shifts, a door opens.
0:7:38|0:7:44|[Xiang Shaolong] brings his fiancée [Jiang Yi] to their new home, and he unties the scarf covering her eyes and opens the curtains.
0:7:44|0:7:46|[Xiang Shaolong] stood by the window.
0:8:0|0:8:1|He raised the key and knelt down on one knee.
0:8:1|0:8:3|Aunt Jiang, with tears in her eyes, covered her mouth and walked towards another room.
0:9:27|0:9:29|Aunt Jiang looked at [Xiang Shaolong].
0:9:51|0:9:53|[Xiang Shaolong] embraces crying Aunt Jiang.
0:10:2|0:10:7|At night, [Sha Lu] passed by a real estate agency and picked up a flyer at the entrance.
0:10:7|0:10:11|[Xiang Shaolong] leaned against the wall on the street, smoking alone.
0:10:15|0:10:23|[Xiang Shaolong] carried a lunch box in his hand as he walked towards the real estate agency where he worked, his attention caught by the sports car parked outside the company's entrance.
0:10:23|0:10:28|On the other side, the young colleague [Very Wong] was playing with the intern's nameplate.
0:10:28|0:10:33|[Xiang Shaolong] carefully examined the sports car before walking into the company's storefront.
0:10:33|0:10:35|[Xiang Shaolong] stared at the intern as soon as he walked in.
0:10:50|0:10:52|[Xiang Shaolong] hesitated to speak.
0:11:12|0:11:15|[Xiang Shaolong] sighed.
0:11:23|0:11:29|[Very Wong] speeds away in a sports car.
0:11:29|0:11:33|[Xiang Shaolong] is alone in the company, opening a lunch box.
0:11:51|0:11:55|After hanging up the phone, he immediately called the client.
0:12:11|0:12:14|This is [Sha Lu] arriving at the agency.
0:12:38|0:12:51|Miss, [Xiang Shaolong] hung up the phone and arrived at Wushuang Terrace with [Sha Lu], [Ah Hei], and [Very Wong].
0:13:47|0:13:47|After the promotion, [Xiang Shaolong]
0:14:19|0:14:22|Four people arrived at the rooftop, [Ah Hei] looked at the distant night view and smiled.
0:14:59|0:15:4|Sha Lu did not respond, he leaned towards [Xiang Shaolong] and said to him.
0:15:29|0:15:39|Sha Lu waved his hand and said, "I have seen many houses, but none of them can compare to this view." The camera then cuts to the four of them arriving on the streets of Hong Kong.
0:15:39|0:15:43|Everyone's face is filled with a happy smile.
0:15:43|0:15:47|Xiang Shaolong, Sha Lu, and Very Wong walked side by side in the tall building, heading towards the law firm.
0:15:47|0:15:51|Xiang Shaolong and Sha Lu each signed their names.
0:15:51|0:15:54|The law firm stamped with the official seal.
0:15:54|0:15:57|The Five-Star Red Flag and the Golden Flag flutter in the wind on the street.
0:15:57|0:16:3|The four of them moved in unison, flipping through and passing around the contracts in the office, signing each page.
0:16:39|0:16:45|After another set was taken by Xiang Shaolong, he wanted to pass it to Very Wong and [Sha Lu], but ended up putting it in his own pocket.
0:16:45|0:16:52|The scene shifts, and Xiang Shaolong, Very Wong, and Sha Lu arrive at the new house. Very Wong smiles and pulls open the curtains, while Sha Lu kneels on the floor to clean it.
0:16:52|0:17:1|When Vivi walked past the freshly cleaned floor, [Sha Lu] flicked her shoe with a rag, while Ah Hei smiled and spread out a brand new condom from the gap under the sofa.
0:17:2|0:17:7|[Xiang Shaolong] looked around with the rental form in hand, and then checked off some boxes on the form.
0:17:7|0:17:14|Wan Rui and [Ah Hei] filled the bookshelf with decorative fake books, while [Sha Lu] placed a pot of garlic-like plants on the side.
0:17:14|0:17:19|[Xiang Shaolong] sat at the table, constantly filling out forms, while the others were tidying up the room.
0:17:20|0:17:24|Later, the few of them sat on the ground, flipping through a pile of signed contracts.
0:17:24|0:17:33|[Ahei] scattered paper playfully, [Xiang Shaolong] pretended to hit him, raising his arm. The camera then cut to [Xiang Shaolong] entering the kitchen, almost bumping into [Sha Lu] holding a vase.
0:17:33|0:17:39|After Ah Hei came out from the other side, the door happened to push Xiang Shaolong out of the room, and the four of them celebrated on the rooftop of the swimming pool building.
0:17:39|0:17:42|[Very Wong] lies on an air mattress in the pool, basking in the sun.
0:18:43|0:18:46|[Sha Lu] furrowed his brows and turned away from the rooftop.
0:18:46|0:18:56|[Very Wong] stuck out his tongue at the back of [Sha Lu], and the three of them followed [Sha Lu]'s gaze, holding champagne in hand and walking into the room together.
0:18:56|0:18:58|[Sha Lu] expressionless, hands in a fighting stance.
0:18:58|0:19:1|[Xiang Shaolong] followed behind him, chasing and speaking.
0:19:14|0:19:16|The three of them immediately ran to the elevator.
0:19:16|0:19:18|The four of them stood there dumbfounded.
0:19:51|0:19:54|In a blink of an eye, [Xiang Shaolong] brought the clients to view the house.
0:19:54|0:19:57|Upon opening the bedroom door, someone was lying on the bed.
0:19:57|0:20:0|[Xiang Shaolong] enters the room and closes the bedroom door behind him.
0:20:6|0:20:8|[Sha Lu] sits up from the bed and dims the light.
0:20:20|0:20:28|The customer opens the bedroom door, [Sha Lu] disguised as a cleaner, is cleaning, and [Xiang Shaolong] greets with a smile.
0:20:28|0:20:31|Immediately, [Xiang Shaolong] took a big gulp of water and swallowed it down.
0:20:37|0:20:41|Xiang Shaolong lunged for the room key on the bedside table.
0:20:41|0:20:45|The two individuals were wrestling on the bed.
0:20:45|0:20:47|At this moment, [Ah Hei] received a phone call.
0:21:6|0:21:9|[Ahei] rushed over carrying bags big and small.
0:21:9|0:21:13|[Sha Lu] is painting at home in high heels, while [Very Wong] is persuading her on the side.
0:21:56|0:21:58|[Sha Lu] scratched his head with a comb and left.
0:21:58|0:22:7|Xiang Shaolong stood alone in front of the law firm with a frown. When he arrived at the apartment of the four people, it was filled with smoke and the room was full of decorative lights.
0:22:7|0:22:9|Many people are gathering inside, with Xiang Shaolong also dancing energetically.
0:22:27|0:22:35|Vivian and [Ah Hei] locked Xiang Shaolong in a wooden cage, while Sha Lu sat on a rocking chair nearby, drinking red wine with a bright smile.
0:22:35|0:22:39|The gathering ended, and the four of them then went to the law firm.
0:23:5|0:23:10|Xiang Shaolong started a fight without saying a word, accidentally knocking off Sha Lu's wig.
0:23:10|0:23:13|The remaining three took the opportunity to pull Xiang Shaolong out of the office.
0:23:25|0:23:33|[Sha Lu] got on the car first, and the other three rushed to Room D in the apartment.
0:23:33|0:23:37|The four of them pushed and shoved each other into the room, even alarming the old lady next door.
0:23:45|0:23:48|Xiang Shaolong also closed the door of the next room and took out the key.
0:23:48|0:23:59|Ah Hei and [Very Wong] are fighting for the study.
0:23:59|0:24:4|[Very Wong] turned around and was stunned to see Ah Hei entering a room and sticking a postcard on the wall.
0:24:16|0:24:24|Xiang Shaolong is lying on a huge teddy bear sofa, holding a rabbit plush toy in his hands.
0:24:24|0:24:28|[Very Wong] said and left, the room was decorated with floral wallpaper and filled with toys.
0:24:28|0:24:34|On the other side, [Sha Lu] is placing her high heels in the public area.
0:25:18|0:25:24|Ah Hei pointed at the masked man who was shot down in the movie, and [Very Wong] looked at him in astonishment.
0:25:24|0:25:27|[Xiang Shaolong] just finished taking a shower.
0:25:29|0:25:32|The vest with holes in it was mocked by [Sha Lu].
0:25:32|0:25:35|After [Sha Lu] left, [Xiang Shaolong] saw a pile of garbage on the ground.
0:25:56|0:26:2|Xiang Shaolong was pushed down on his back, lying on the floor with wires scattered around him, while the four of them stared at a black hair on the wall.
0:26:38|0:26:43|Ah Hei took a piece of board painting and covered it in front of the wall.
0:26:50|0:26:54|[Xiang Shaolong] mocked [Sha Lu] before leaving, and [Sha Lu] returned to her own room.
0:26:54|0:26:57|Wan Rui and Ah Hei smiled at each other and went back to their rooms.
0:26:57|0:27:2|The next morning came quickly.
0:27:16|0:27:36|Xiang Shaolong and the others were frantically tidying up the house. Xiang Shaolong put the toothbrush in the toilet tank, inserted a fake flower into the water pipe, hid leftover snacks in a fake book, and threw all the miscellaneous items on the table into the sliding coffee table.
0:28:1|0:28:10|[Sha Lu] walked out of the room in high heels, carrying utensils, muttering to [Xiang Shaolong] who was eating bread.
0:28:10|0:28:18|The scene shifts, [Sha Lu] takes a taxi home, and a billboard by the roadside reads that the district councilor has successfully secured the installation of glass doors for the market building.
0:28:46|0:28:51|[Sha Lu] had a happy smile on his face as the driver turned the direction and headed down the mountain.
0:28:51|0:28:54|[Sha Lu] walked into the district councilor's office holding a box of Lego.
0:28:59|0:29:3|[Sha Lu] sits among the piles of paper and newspapers in the room, observing the full cabinet of documents.
0:30:44|0:30:50|[Sha Lu] nodded at a staff member, and the scene shifted to [Xiang Shaolong] sleeping in the children's room.
0:30:50|0:30:53|Accompanied by the ringing of the phone, he searched around for his mobile phone.
0:31:19|0:31:23|[Ahei] is lying in the living room smoking a hookah, with smoke swirling in the air.
0:32:6|0:32:10|After [Very Wong] finished speaking, he revealed a standard smile with eight teeth.
0:32:10|0:32:15|Later, the other three threw all the miscellaneous items in the living room onto [Very Wong]'s bed.
0:32:15|0:32:21|The few of them shot baskets with great accuracy, and the bed neatly stored all the items.
0:32:21|0:32:24|This scene leaves [Very Wong] dumbfounded.
0:32:24|0:32:29|[Xiang Shaolong] was busy opening the door to greet guests with his underwear showing.
0:32:32|0:32:34|He is [Very Wong], an intern at the company.
0:33:15|0:33:18|[Ahei] put down the cigarette in his hand, overturned the chess pieces on the table with one hand, and stood up to take off his clothes.
0:33:40|0:33:47|He threw his hat and scarf on the ground and walked briskly towards the door.
0:34:8|0:34:10|[Sha Lu] nodded and got up to leave.
0:34:10|0:34:16|On the other side, [Ah Hei] sat alone on the steps of the slide, kicking off her high heels.
0:34:16|0:34:20|Sha Lu walked towards Ah Hei holding his slippers in her hand.
0:34:21|0:34:25|[Ahei] glanced at [Sha Lu], nibbling on his nails.
0:34:44|0:34:49|Sha Lu sighed, Xiang Shaolong glanced at her, and then said.
0:35:40|0:35:53|My mom has been with so many men, only Xiang Shaolong. Sha Lu hesitated for a long time, picked up the slipper in his hand and handed it to Very Wong.
0:35:53|0:36:1|[Ahei] looked at the slippers handed by [Sha Lu], then glanced at the expectant eyes of [Sha Lu], sighed hesitantly, but did not take the slippers.
0:36:1|0:36:8|The scene shifts to a new real estate development under construction, where property salespeople are waiting at the intersection for customers.
0:36:8|0:36:14|A taxi pulled up, and [Xiang Shaolong] and other real estate salespeople swarmed around, surrounding the taxi.
0:36:18|0:36:22|[Xiang Shaolong] rushes towards a newly arrived small car.
0:36:46|0:36:49|[Sha Lu] immediately ran away when he saw an acquaintance.
0:37:5|0:37:7|The woman is a mediocre person, carrying the child.
0:37:44|0:37:48|The woman waved her hand, and the onlooker took the child away. [Sha Lu] smiled awkwardly.
0:38:5|0:38:14|[Sha Lu] turned his head away in despair, while the woman's gaze fixed on the diamond ring on [Sha Lu]'s ring finger. [Sha Lu] then hid his hand in his sleeve.
0:38:41|0:39:3|Xiang Shaolong handed the advertisement in the woman's hand and passed another sales order to her. The scene shifted, and it was already dark. The neighbor, an elderly lady, slowly walked over with a cane. Sitting on the steps at the entrance of the community were Xiang Shaolong and Sha Lu. They waved to the elderly lady, and Sha Lu also waved and greeted her. Sha Lu nodded expressionlessly.
0:39:3|0:39:7|[Xiang Shaolong] looked at her, then at the old lady. [Sha Lu] spoke.
0:42:31|0:42:33|[Xiang Shaolong] nodded.
0:42:44|0:42:47|[Sha Lu] had moist eyes, [Xiang Shaolong] turned his head to the side.
0:42:52|0:42:58|The scene shifts, [Ah Hei] squats by the roadside, stuffing the parcel in his hand into the bag.
0:42:58|0:43:3|A bus arrived, and [Sha Lu] quickly slung his huge backpack over his shoulder to chase after the bus.
0:43:3|0:43:8|The bus did not stop, [Ah Hei] struggled to catch up to the red light at the intersection, pounding on the car body.
0:43:16|0:43:20|The driver glanced back at [Ah Hei] outside the car door and drove off without looking back.
0:43:20|0:43:25|Only [Ah Hei] was left standing in the middle of the road, panting as he watched the bus drive away.
0:43:25|0:43:32|He viciously threw the package on the ground, kicked it a few times, and then walked away in the opposite direction.
0:43:32|0:43:39|A pile of remaining parcels scattered in the middle of the road.
0:43:39|0:43:42|On the other side, Xiang Shaolong's fiancée, Aunt Jiang, came to his company.
0:43:48|0:43:58|[Xiang Shaolong] immediately stepped forward.
0:43:58|0:44:2|He settled [Aunt Jiang] in a chair on the side, tidying up the documents on the table.
0:44:19|0:44:25|The sudden appearance of the boss interrupted the conversation between the two, [Xiang Shaolong] was about to leave, but then remembered [Aunt Jiang] and turned back.
0:44:29|0:44:39|[Aunt Jiang] was about to leave when [Xiang Shaolong] grabbed her arm, took out a box from under the desk, and opened it to reveal a pair of exquisitely crafted high heels.
0:44:39|0:44:45|[Xiang Shaolong] held up a shoe in front of her, and [Mrs. Jiang] took the shoe in surprise.
0:45:32|0:45:34|[Xiang Shaolong] raised the folder in his hand.
0:45:34|0:45:36|As the group set off, [Xiang Shaolong] ran into an acquaintance right after leaving the house.
0:46:26|0:46:40|Mr. Xu handed the Samoyed's leash to [Xiang Shaolong], as the car drove away. The Samoyed struggled to break free from the leash and chase after the car, while [Xiang Shaolong] exerted all his strength to hold onto the leash, looking quite comical and ridiculous.
0:46:40|0:46:56|On the other side, [Sha Lu] paced back and forth in the kitchen at home. She looked at the sun outside the curtains, the sunlight shining on her face, casting particularly beautiful shadows. She seemed a bit restless, using her hands to pound on the table and pacing back and forth.
0:46:56|0:46:59|On the table were her phone and a pretty desk lamp.
0:47:1|0:47:12|She contemplated for a while, picked up the phone on the table, unlocked it, typed "husband" on the screen, and sent it, then stared at the phone screen without blinking.
0:47:12|0:47:16|At this moment, the online status under the husband's name changed to "typing".
0:47:17|0:47:24|[Sha Lu] smiled, but soon the smile disappeared as he continued typing.
0:47:24|0:47:32|She put down her phone, tears in her eyes, propped her arms on the table, covered her eyes with both hands, and forcefully flicked her short hair back.
0:47:32|0:47:40|She placed the suitcase on the kitchen table, and upon opening it, she found neatly organized kitchen utensils inside, along with many tools for making desserts.
0:47:41|0:47:53|On the other side, [Xiang Shaolong] is waiting by the roadside for Xu Zicong to return, while the Samoyed is tied to a fire hydrant.
0:47:53|0:47:56|There is some poop behind the butt.
0:47:56|0:47:59|[Xiang Shaolong] picked up the phone and called Xu Zicong, but the call went unanswered.
0:48:17|0:48:36|[Xiang Shaolong] picked up the advertisement paper and scooped up the poop on the ground. Then he squatted in front of the trash can and threw it in. His phone beeped with a message from Manager Weiwen. [Very Wong] is amazing. As soon as he arrived at the scene, he brought in a customer who bought three houses at once.
0:48:36|0:48:46|[Xiang Shaolong] was immediately frustrated, he punched his head, looked around, slowly got up, walked to the side of [Sha Lu], and picked up the folder on the ground.
0:48:47|0:48:53|At this moment, [Xu Zicong] approached from behind with a book in his hand.
0:48:53|0:48:56|[Xiang Shaolong] instantly put on a smile on his face, facing [Very Wong].
0:49:18|0:49:29|[Xu Zicong] handed the book to [Xiang Shaolong], quickly squatted down, untied the dog leash recorded on the fire hydrant, then stood up and took the book, turned around, and led [Sha Lu] away.
0:49:29|0:49:32|[Xiang Shaolong] stood alone at the entrance of the company, heaved a long sigh.
0:49:34|0:49:48|On the other side, [Sha Lu] is at home making exquisite desserts. She carefully squeezes cream onto the cupcake, admires her work for a moment, and then delicately places each small cake on the cake stand.
0:49:48|0:49:58|The cake stand was filled to the brim, [Sha Lu] looked at the fruits of her hard work with satisfaction, smiled, and took out her phone, as if anticipating something.
0:49:58|0:50:12|Nodding to himself, Xiang Shaolong continued to decorate the cake stand in front of him, whipped cream made by [Sha Lu], with two flowers placed on the side as decorations for the cake, and a sign saying "Happy Anniversary" on the cake.
0:50:12|0:50:22|[Sha Lu] became more and more impatient as he poured a whole can of sugar into the bowl with a fierce expression. After stirring for a few moments, he took out his phone and stared at the screen.
0:50:22|0:50:26|She repeatedly picked up her phone, but never received any messages.
0:50:28|0:50:35|Until all the cake stands were filled by him, he stared blankly at the table, slowly stirring the cream in his hands.
0:50:35|0:50:42|Shortly after, [Xiang Shaolong] picked up his phone and watched as the time jumped from 23:59 to 0:00.
0:50:42|0:50:51|He stared straight ahead, expressionless, with the hand holding the phone hanging down, tears swirling in his eyes.
0:50:51|0:50:54|Sha Lu walks into the living room and sees Xiang Shaolong sitting on the sofa, trimming his nails.
0:51:28|0:51:34|[Sha Lu] nodded, hunched over and walked towards the kitchen, frowning at [Xiang Shaolong], his gaze following him.
0:51:35|0:51:51|[Sha Lu] entered the kitchen, tears in her eyes. She picked up a cupcake that she had made herself, crushed it fiercely with her fist, and watched as the cake, along with the corners of her mouth, fell downward. Slowly, she picked up another piece and crushed it in the same way.
0:51:52|0:51:57|The cake and cream were stuck to his hands, no matter how hard he rubbed.
0:51:57|0:52:0|Tears welled up and streamed down the cheeks.
0:52:0|0:52:6|The sadness was overwhelming, [Sha Lu] looked at the chunks of cake in his hand and eventually cried out.
0:52:10|0:52:16|Immediately after, he grabbed a round cake from the dessert table and forcefully threw it on the ground.
0:52:16|0:52:25|Later, the three-tier celebration anniversary cake was overturned onto the table, and [Very Wong] used a rolling pin thicker than his own arm to pound the collapsed cake.
0:52:26|0:52:32|In the living room, [Xiang Shaolong] was completely unaware of everything until he heard the knocking sound.
0:52:32|0:52:41|He perked up his ears to locate the source of the sound, and before long, he was dozing off on the sofa, furrowing his brow and letting out a sigh, then pondering about something.
0:52:42|0:52:46|[Xiang Shaolong] got up and walked to the kitchen, stretching his arms and legs.
0:52:46|0:52:51|Upon entering the kitchen, Xiang Shaolong was stunned by the chaotic mess on the table in front of him.
0:52:51|0:53:2|He walked up to [Sha Lu] while staring at the table, at the same time, [Sha Lu] carefully decorated a plate of jelly and brought it to [Xiang Shaolong].
0:53:14|0:53:20|And picked up a small spoon, sending the jelly into the mouth.
0:53:32|0:53:38|[Sha Lu] slowly approached [Xiang Shaolong], who took a few steps back until his back was pressed against the refrigerator.
0:53:38|0:53:47|[Sha Lu] grabbed him by the neck and kissed him wildly.
0:53:47|0:53:51|At this moment, [Xiang Shaolong] takes the initiative and tries to tear off [Sha Lu]'s clothes.
0:54:1|0:54:6|Xiang Shaolong and Very Wong arrived at Sha Lu's bed, Xiang Shaolong threw Sha Lu's apron on the ground and turned off the lights.
0:54:22|0:54:29|The camera cuts to a beautiful and fair-skinned wealthy girl with long legs walking out from behind a portrait.
0:54:45|0:54:47|An old man walked down the stairs.
0:55:0|0:55:7|Mr. Bai's father pointed to a nearby artistic sculpture, and [Very Wong] carefully examined the sculpture, pursing his lips.
0:55:7|0:55:9|Xiang Shaolong's father smiled.
0:55:15|0:55:22|The beauty also laughed happily beside him, and her father turned his back and continued to admire other works of art.
0:55:28|0:55:35|[Xiang Shaolong], who is playing with real estate ads, sees the foreign client borrowed by Aunt Jiang passing by the store front.
0:55:56|0:55:59|[Xiang Shaolong] tightly pulled his sleeve.
0:56:8|0:56:13|On the other side, [Sha Lu], who was strolling on the street, received a call from [Xiang Shaolong].

0:58:57|0:58:59|[Ahei] said he works very hard.
0:59:24|0:59:26|[Ahei] finished speaking and turned to leave.
1:1:11|1:1:16|Xiang Shaolong reached out and held hands with [Very Wong], who then held hands with [Sha Lu].
1:1:17|1:1:25|[Sha Lu] placed her hand on Xiang Shaolong's and [Ah Hei]'s hands, the four of them formed a circle holding hands, closing their eyes and bowing their heads.
1:1:56|1:1:59|After a brief eye contact with [Sha Lu], Xiang Shaolong turned his head and rushed into the house.
1:2:7|1:2:9|[Ahei] stared at Xiang Shaolong's face.

1:2:20|1:2:27|Wan Rui and [Ah Hei] smiled, Xu Zicong's girlfriend [Bai Fumei], lit up the house, fixed her hair neatly, and ran out.
1:2:30|1:2:32|Xu Zicong pushed Xiang Shaolong aside.

1:3:21|1:3:26|You bought this house, and [Xu Zicong] pulled his girlfriend aside.

1:5:30|1:5:34|He stuffed the check into his mouth.
1:5:34|1:5:38|[Xu Zicong] stared at Xiang Shaolong's face.

1:6:30|1:6:35|Bai Fengmei turned and left, [Xu Zicong] looked at the door and lowered his head.
1:6:35|1:6:38|Ah Hei helped [Sha Lu], who was sitting on the ground, to sit on the sofa.
1:6:38|1:6:45|[Xu Zicong] turned around, facing the four people in the room, raised his arm, and then helplessly put it down.
1:6:45|1:6:53|He walked to the dining table, sat down slowly on a chair, licked his lips, looked around the four people with a vacant gaze, and said.
1:8:18|1:8:27|[Xu Zicong] kicked fiercely, overturned the dining table, then bent over to hold his rheumatic leg, and walked up to [Xiang Shaolong].
1:8:32|1:8:46|[Xu Zicong] picked up the hat from the ground and stood up, saying.
1:8:46|1:8:52|After speaking, [Xiang Shaolong] limped out of the door.
1:8:52|1:8:55|[Xiang Shaolong] leaned against the dining counter and slowly squatted down.
1:9:45|1:9:51|[Sha Lu] sat on the sofa, nodding slightly.
1:9:55|1:10:0|Night falls, [Xiang Shaolong] is alone on the balcony smoking a cigarette.
1:10:0|1:10:6|The camera slowly moves up, [Sha Lu] is on the rooftop, supporting his head with both hands, lost in thought.
1:10:6|1:10:11|In the pitch-black sky, apart from a few dark clouds, no light can be seen.
1:10:11|1:10:19|The scene cuts to Xiang Shaolong and [Aunt Jiang] sitting side by side on a bench by the seaside, watching the brightly lit pier.
1:10:19|1:10:23|[Xiang Shaolong] lowered his head as [Aunt Jiang] spoke.
1:10:45|1:10:49|[Aunt Jiang] sighed and looked at [Xiang Shaolong].
1:10:57|1:11:5|He stood up with a backpack on his back, furrowing his brow, tears swirling in his eyes, [Xiang Shaolong] also stood up, facing each other.
1:11:7|1:11:15|After speaking, [Madame Jiang] hugged [Xiang Shaolong], while [Sha Lu] stood aside, watching everything. [Xiang Shaolong] also held [Madame Jiang] tightly, refusing to let go.
1:11:15|1:11:24|In the end, [Madam Jiang] pushed away [Xiang Shaolong], grabbed the nearby suitcase and left. At that moment, [Sha Lu] suddenly approached [Madam Jiang].
1:11:32|1:11:41|[Aunt Jiang] swept [Sha Lu] from top to bottom, finally locking her gaze on the exquisite high heels she was wearing.
1:11:41|1:11:47|Finally, he lifted his head and looked at [Sha Lu] expressionlessly.
1:12:32|1:12:36|[Sha Lu] listened and then turned to look blankly at [Xiang Shaolong].
1:12:36|1:12:42|[Xiang Shaolong] also stared at [Sha Lu] until Aunt Jiang looked at him, then he turned his gaze back to Aunt Jiang.
1:12:49|1:12:52|Jiang Yi lifted the suitcase and left.
1:12:52|1:13:0|[Xiang Shaolong] took a step forward to chase after Jiang Yi as he walked away, but couldn't catch up, his gaze following him all the way.
1:13:0|1:13:4|[Xiang Shaolong] and [Sha Lu] stood still, both silent.
1:13:4|1:13:10|They then walked side by side on the pedestrian bridge by the sea.
1:13:10|1:13:14|Both Xiang Shaolong and Sha Lu gazed ahead in the night, surrounded by towering buildings.
1:13:16|1:13:20|The dazzling neon lights set off the loneliness of the two.
1:13:20|1:13:26|The two of them walked to the seaside, blowing the sea breeze, and looked down at the quiet waves rolling continuously.
1:13:26|1:13:28|So, the two of them arrived at the drive-in movie theater.
1:14:19|1:14:27|Sha [Sha Lu] held a diamond ring in his hand, raised it up to carefully examine the big and shiny diamond, and then casually threw it on the ground.
1:14:27|1:14:34|He sat cross-legged on the bed, with a suitcase in front of him containing various exquisite high-heeled shoes, shining brightly.
1:14:36|1:14:42|Then he closed the box, propped his forearm on it, tears in his eyes.
1:14:42|1:14:51|The scene shifts, [Sha Lu] appears on the street, holding a flyer in one hand and biting the knuckles of the other hand, searching for something in the crowd.
1:14:51|1:14:57|On the other side, [Xiang Shaolong] was lying on the children's sofa at home, with disheveled clothes.
1:14:57|1:15:5|Sha Lu returned home and saw this scene, as well as an empty wine bottle on the table next to it. She frowned and squatted down beside Xiang Shaolong.
1:15:22|1:15:25|[Xiang Shaolong] closed his eyes again and fell back asleep.
1:15:25|1:15:31|The scene shifts to the factory where Xiang Shaolong and Sha Lu work, with workers busy loading and unloading goods onto trucks.
1:15:54|1:16:13|[Xiang Shaolong] looked at [Ah Hei] with a worried expression, while [Sha Lu] looked at [Xiang Shaolong]. The three of them arrived at a iron gate with a password. After glancing around, [Ah Hei] entered the password and the gate slowly opened. There was only a small glass window on the door, through which they could see outside. The room was pitch black.
1:16:13|1:16:16|The narrow aisle is lined with doors made of iron mesh.
1:16:23|1:16:25|[Very Wong] closed the door behind him.
1:16:41|1:16:50|[Ahei] introduced the two to the information neatly arranged on the bookshelves in the iron net, with pages of paper placed in an orderly manner on the shelves.
1:16:50|1:16:55|[Xiang Shaolong] looked through the iron fence at those house deeds, and walked alone towards the depths.
1:16:55|1:17:4|The iron net divided the house deed into small cage-like rooms, with [Xiang Shaolong] standing in the center. The top lights behind him flickered one after another as he continued walking inside.
1:17:5|1:17:14|[Sha Lu] poked his head out behind him, following [Xiang Shaolong] with [Very Wong], each of them looking at what was in front of them.
1:17:14|1:17:25|[Xiang Shaolong] looked up, sneered, and the camera pulled back to a distant shot. The lighting in the warehouse where the device was placed was very dim, resembling a huge maze.
1:17:25|1:17:30|The scene changes, the elevator doors slowly open, and three people walk out of the elevator. 
1:17:36|1:17:40|[Ahei] turned around, pressed the button of another elevator, and walked into the elevator car.
1:17:40|1:17:43|Sha Lu and Xiang Shaolong walked out.
1:17:55|1:17:59|[Xiang Shaolong] stood with his hands in his pockets, looking at [Sha Lu] with a puzzled expression.
1:18:12|1:18:13|Xiang Shaolong and Sha Lu walked to the outside of the factory, the sky was already dark.
1:18:34|1:18:34|[Xiang Shaolong] smiled happily when he heard this, and [Sha Lu] also laughed along.
1:18:34|1:18:35|Sha Lu stared at Xiang Shaolong intently, and Xiang Shaolong immediately wiped his face.
1:19:6|1:19:13|Xiang Shaolong and Sha Lu walked to the street corner, smiled at each other, and stopped in their tracks.
1:19:13|1:19:15|[Xiang Shaolong] looked at [Sha Lu] and said solemnly.
1:19:33|1:19:40|Speak up, [Sha Lu] opened his arms, and the two embraced tightly, spinning around together.
1:19:40|1:19:46|The scene shifts, [Xiang Shaolong] in pajamas, standing in [Sha Lu]'s room, fiddling with a lamp.

1:20:9|1:20:17|[Ahei] is working in the construction site, pulling goods from the city and countryside with the Nangongs. [Sha Lu] is standing in front of the blackboard teaching, with the blackboard covered in English writing.
1:20:17|1:20:25|Sitting below are a group of middle-aged and elderly students dozing off. Suddenly, a notice of debt appears in front of the camera, with the words clearly written on it.
1:20:37|1:20:46|[Sha Lu] handed a paper bag to [Xiang Shaolong], who changed into new pajamas and walked up to [Sha Lu].
1:20:46|1:20:52|He kissed [Sha Lu] and pushed her down in his nursery.
1:21:6|1:21:10|With only two days left until the closing date, Xiang Shaolong, Sha Lu, and Very Wong are having a barbecue on the rooftop.
1:21:10|1:21:15|[Xiang Shaolong] and [Sha Lu] had their arms around each other, while [Very Wong] confessed his feelings to [Ah Hei].
1:21:15|1:21:21|The scene shifts, [Sha Lu] arrives at [Xiang Shaolong]'s company to deliver food.
1:21:21|1:21:22|At this moment, [Very Wong] suddenly received a phone call.
1:21:44|1:21:50|When [Sha Lu] and [Xiang Shaolong] arrived at the airport, many intermediaries had been waiting for a long time and were blocked by security guards in the aisle.
1:22:1|1:22:10|Xiang Shaolong and Sha Lu were arranged to leave from the back door immediately by the accompanying staff, while a group of intermediaries followed closely behind, with Very Wong and Very Wong at the back of the crowd.
1:22:10|1:22:13|Turning around, [Xiang Shaolong] saw Aunt Jiang standing behind him.
1:22:14|1:22:18|Aunt Jiang looked at [Sha Lu] next to him, and the three of them felt a bit awkward.
1:22:18|1:22:27|Later, Aunt Jiang used her own public transportation card to swipe open the glass door beside her, turned back to [Xiang Shaolong], and glanced at Mr. Shi who had already walked far away.
1:22:31|1:22:35|[Sha Lu] also casually picked up a bottle of mineral water from the table.
1:22:35|1:22:36|Xiang Shaolong and Sha Lu intercepted the road by taking a shortcut.
1:22:41|1:22:56|[Sha Lu] handed the water to Mr. Shi, while they ran and talked.
1:22:56|1:23:0|Followed by a group of people holding real estate ads, Xiang Shaolong rushes forward economically.
1:23:0|1:23:4|A group of people ran over, and a piece of advertisement fluttered to the ground.
1:23:10|1:23:13|Sha Lu lifts up the cage, Mr. Shi runs away.
1:23:13|1:23:15|Two of them were knocked down to the ground by a group of people.
1:23:18|1:23:22|A car stopped in front of [Mr. Shi], and several people quickly got in.
1:23:22|1:23:29|[Xiang Shaolong] pushed away a group of real estate salespeople with all his might.
1:23:29|1:23:33|The driver turned out to be [Ah Hei].
1:23:33|1:23:37|He made a sharp turn and left the group of real estate agents far behind.
1:23:37|1:23:46|[Ahei] goes against traffic, narrowly avoiding two cars, and scares [Xiang Shaolong], [Sha Lu], and [Mr. Shi] in the car, along with the assistant, with a mysterious and terrifying dragon face, screaming in violation of the rules.
1:23:50|1:23:59|With the roar of the engine and the intimidating black smoke from the exhaust, Xiang Shaolong, like driving a race car, chased after him, even forcing the oncoming vehicles to stop.
1:23:59|1:24:5|[Ahei] drove to a bridge and saw through the rearview mirror a line of cars crazily chasing behind.
1:24:5|1:24:10|[Ahei] remains calm, smoothly shifting gears and accelerating ahead in the group of cars.
1:24:39|1:24:44|Other real estate agents' cars followed closely behind, and [Ah Hei] smoothly turned into a roundabout.
1:24:44|1:24:49|At this moment, a McLaren cut in from the side and forced the other vehicles to stop in the convoy.
1:24:49|1:24:57|[Very Wong] drove the McLaren alongside [Sha Lu] and [Ah Hei], pointing outside the window in surprise to [Xiang Shaolong], as the others in the car turned to look at [Very Wong].
1:24:57|1:25:3|[Ahei] gave a thumbs up to [Very Wong], who ran his thumb across his nose and made a cool gesture.
1:25:4|1:25:13|Following that, [Ah Hei] pointed to his own eyes and then gestured towards the back, indicating [Very Wong], who then drove out along the roundabout.
1:25:13|1:25:33|[Ahei] had a smooth journey here. When he met up with [Very Wong], without stopping the car, [Very Wong] opened the door and got into the passenger seat. They headed towards the road that must pass through Wushuangtai. Workers were diligently coloring the original lines on the ground.
1:25:35|1:25:55|The useless road signs were also removed, and a large poster of the councilor was hung up behind the road, with the words "Successfully improved traffic congestion in Banshan, changing the one-way road sign to two-way, lowering the minimum speed to 70 mph, and painting over the stop lines on the road. The female councilor stood on the side of the road waving and greeting passersby.
1:25:55|1:25:59|The cameraman is also shooting on the side.
1:26:13|1:26:19|Between [Xiang Shaolong] and [Sha Lu], Mr. Shi picked it up in the car.
1:26:21|1:26:23|Xiang Shaolong, Sha Lu, and Very Wong arrived at the Wushuang Platform.
1:26:42|1:26:45|The two assistants sat on the side, looking at the documents.
1:26:45|1:26:47|Xiang Shaolong and [Sha Lu] opened the balcony door.
1:27:4|1:27:20|Mr. Shi held Xiang Shaolong's face, kissed it, kissed it again, and smiled, saying.
1:27:20|1:27:26|Mr. Shi looked at his assistant sitting beside him, who gave him an OK gesture, and he reached out his right hand to [Sha Lu].
1:27:37|1:27:48|As the two were about to embrace, Xiang Shaolong intervened.
1:27:48|1:27:55|Xiang Shaolong excitedly embraces [Sha Lu] and spins around in place.
1:28:2|1:28:6|After Xiang Shaolong finished speaking, the remaining three people stared quietly at his face.
1:28:19|1:28:25|Everyone laughed happily and embraced each other, cheering joyfully.
1:28:25|1:28:30|The scene shifts, with an African beauty sitting at the back of an open truck.
1:28:30|1:28:34|[Very Wong] and [Sha Lu] were waving their hands at the truck while wearing tank tops.
1:28:48|1:28:54|The camera pans to a lakeside far away from the city, surrounded by several three-story small buildings.
1:28:54|1:29:0|[Sha Lu] looked through the letters inside and smiled happily.
1:29:0|1:29:7|She handed two postcards to Xiang Shaolong, who was watering the plants, then opened a letter and took out an advertisement paper filled with housing listings.
1:29:12|1:29:18|[Xiang Shaolong] took the advertisement from his hand, [Sha Lu] smiled at him and walked away.
1:29:18|1:29:22|He crumpled the advertisement into a ball and threw it into the nearby trash can.
1:29:22|1:29:28|Later, the two of them rolled up in sleeping bags together, with many outdoor items still on the table in front of them.
1:29:28|1:29:32|The two of them playfully bickered while happily packing their bags.
1:29:52|1:29:59|They packed their bags and ran happily on the slope, arriving at a lush lawn for camping.
1:29:59|1:30:4|Sha Lu walked out of the tent and sat on a small chair opposite Xiang Shaolong.
1:30:15|1:30:20|The two of them ran freely hand in hand on the grass.
