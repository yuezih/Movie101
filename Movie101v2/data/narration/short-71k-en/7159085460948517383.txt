0:0:47|0:0:54|The eagle soars across the sky, accompanied by a strong and powerful cry, the once silent [Yue Feng] now has a determined look in his eyes as he moves forward steadily.
0:0:57|0:1:8|He walked out of the darkness and finally stopped in a patch of light, his eyes complex and resolute, filled with anger, hatred, and aspirations waiting to be fulfilled.
0:1:8|0:1:15|He seems imprisoned in a small space, yet also floating in the heavens and the earth.
0:1:15|0:1:22|Accompanied by a brisk and powerful music, a mysterious young man strides powerfully, leading us to the field.
0:1:24|0:1:37|In the field, more than 20 people were already standing, each carrying sticks and weapons, moving their heads and stretching their muscles, but their expressions couldn't hide their panic.
0:1:37|0:1:47|And this mysterious young man, bare-handed and with a look of aggression in his eyes, walked onto the field with the spirit of heading to the battlefield, heading towards the vast crowd.
0:1:50|0:1:56|Seeing the mysterious teenager approaching aggressively, a group of people on the field also moved forward.
0:1:56|0:2:1|With the mysterious teenager standing still, a gunshot rang out, revealing his name.
0:2:6|0:2:9|He asked the leading teenager on the other side.
0:2:17|0:2:26|With the top scholar giving the order, a dozen or so henchmen immediately swarmed towards [Yue Feng], brandishing their clubs ready to strike.
0:2:26|0:2:37|[Yue Feng] is no fool, he immediately spots the approaching hoodlums and takes them down effortlessly, one after another, with just a few moves.
0:2:37|0:2:44|From the side, a burly man tried to sneak attack [Yue Feng] when he was off guard, but was lifted up by [Yue Feng] and slammed heavily to the ground.
0:2:45|0:2:50|[Yue Feng] more than ten moves, each move is unbeatable, without any unnecessary actions.
0:2:50|0:2:55|Each punch and kick hits an enemy with precision.
0:2:55|0:2:59|The henchmen were not giving up, cautiously probing one by one.
0:2:59|0:3:4|A boy in a hoodie punches towards Yue Feng's head.
0:3:4|0:3:10|[Yue Feng] snatched the weapon from the boy's hand and gave a kick to the person behind him who was about to attack.
0:3:12|0:3:18|A punch landed on the boy's face, leaving him dazed and falling to the ground.
0:3:18|0:3:25|After several rounds of attacks, even though Yue Feng's martial arts skills were strong, he couldn't avoid being attacked by everyone in turn.
0:3:25|0:3:33|Three men together knocked down [Yue Feng], who struggled to get up but was held down, while the leader of the group pushed his face towards [Yue Feng].
0:3:34|0:3:38|[Yue Feng] immediately got up and threw the leading teenager flying.
0:3:38|0:3:45|The fight is still going on, seeing the leader youth being ruthlessly thrown away, the others formed a formation and joined the battle together.
0:3:45|0:3:50|The teenager with a determined look led his brothers straight up and knocked down [Yue Feng].
0:3:50|0:3:55|The other six quickly grabbed [Yue Feng]'s limbs and dragged him towards the center of the field.
0:4:3|0:4:12|After escaping, [Yue Feng] climbed up along the fence of the field, trying to flee, but was soon surrounded by the crowd and his escape attempt failed.
0:4:12|0:4:19|Yue Feng, outnumbered, was forced into a corner with a group of people surrounding him, raining down heavy punches and blows on his body.
0:4:26|0:4:35|Others quickly made way, clearing a space. The young man with the stick raised it high, ready to strike down heavily, the outcome of the confrontation known to no one.
0:4:35|0:4:40|The blow knocked Yue Feng unconscious, landing him in prison and also giving the film its title.
0:4:41|0:4:46|The king of the street, four words, the story unfolds in a mysterious and confusing manner.
0:4:56|0:5:9|[Yue Feng] bent down and nodded, bidding farewell to the prison guard. He then raised his head in a daze, looking at the somewhat unfamiliar sky outside the prison. The fleeting sense of youthful righteousness was hidden in his eyes.
0:5:9|0:5:15|The years have worn away his hostility and sharpness, replaced by the moistness in his eyes.
0:5:15|0:5:18|After leaving prison, [Yue Feng] set out on his own to start a new life.
0:5:19|0:5:23|Passing through two rows of tall trees, through the crowded streets,
0:5:23|0:5:27|Entered the alleyway, curiously looking at the surroundings.
0:5:27|0:5:32|Yue Feng strides into a small restaurant, and the owner asks.
0:5:35|0:5:46|Hearing the sound, Kai Zi suddenly turned around from behind the shelf and walked forward in surprise to confirm. The two embraced excitedly, and Kai Zi looked at [Yue Feng] with many questions in mind.
0:5:49|0:5:56|The landlady interrupted with a cup of tea.
0:5:56|0:6:0|Kai Zi excitedly introduces, but his wife pushes his hand away.
0:6:0|0:6:5|Kaizi could only smile awkwardly as [Yue Feng] lowered his eyes.
0:6:5|0:6:12|Kaizi poured tea, apologized to his wife, [Yue Feng] shook his head helplessly, smiling even uglier than crying, Kaizi quickly comforted him.
0:6:31|0:6:37|The wife played with the cup in her hand and then left, catching the attention of the two men.
0:6:40|0:6:46|Kaizi stood up to comfort his wife, while [Yue Feng] could only stand by with a forced smile.
0:7:7|0:7:11|Accompanied by the sound of a broken cup, the seat was empty.
0:7:11|0:7:16|[Yue Feng] has quietly left, wandering aimlessly around.
0:7:16|0:7:23|The city is bustling with traffic and people, everyone is going about their lives in an orderly manner.
0:7:23|0:7:26|The bus window reflected the face of [Yue Feng], looking lost and confused.
0:7:29|0:7:39|No one can tell [Yue Feng] where to go or what to do, but he understands that the road ahead is long and he can only rely on himself.
0:7:39|0:7:43|[Yue Feng] watched as the traffic flowed into the night, as darkness fell.
0:7:43|0:7:54|Today, he dragged his weary body across the platform, overpasses, and streets, walking to the pedestrian street accompanied by moonlight and neon lights.
0:7:54|0:8:4|On the big screen in the pedestrian street, he saw a woman who was unrecognizable, adding a terrifying atmosphere to this unfamiliar city.
0:8:4|0:8:15|Looking around at the passing crowd, people hurried along, no one willing to stop their forward steps.
0:8:15|0:8:23|Yue Feng stood still for a moment, confused and at a loss, unable to find a direction but unable to stop searching.
0:8:27|0:8:34|Homeless [Yue Feng] is still searching, still wandering, his steps getting heavier and his body more exhausted.
0:8:36|0:8:43|[Yue Feng] accidentally arrived at a deserted construction site at night, continuing to search for a place to settle down for the night.
0:8:43|0:9:3|After countless disappointments, he finally found a spacious bare room and decided to take a rest there. He neatly arranged the straw in the corner, lay down peacefully, covered himself with the extra straw, and gradually fell asleep, having a sound first sleep after a bath.
0:9:6|0:9:9|The sun rises in the east, the morning light appears.
0:9:9|0:9:13|Facing the morning dew, [Yue Feng] practiced on the rooftop.
0:9:13|0:9:18|Bending legs, punching, kicking, with powerful and vigorous movements.
0:9:18|0:9:28|Between each punch and kick, [Yue Feng] gradually found the feeling of his previous training, accelerating his footwork and speed. He delivered a flying kick with perfect form, resembling [Bruce Lee].
0:9:28|0:9:34|Xiao Feng confidently danced, soothing Yue Feng's emotions, as the morning sun transitioned from dim to bright.
0:9:35|0:9:42|After finishing his training, [Yue Feng] sat on the rooftop, gazing into the distance, secretly determined to come to the construction site to seek opportunities.
0:10:2|0:10:8|[Yue Feng] eagerly awaited, only to receive bad news. He pretended to be strong.
0:10:8|0:10:15|The foreman's words were like a sledgehammer on Yue Feng's heart, and he walked away with a lonely figure.
0:10:28|0:10:44|Soon, the thieves ran into a complex alleyway. Suddenly changing direction, the beauty slammed on the brakes and charged into the alley where the thieves were hiding. The thieves mesmerized the beauty, blocking her way out, and leered at her with ill intentions.
0:10:49|0:10:54|Speak up, or touch the face of a beauty, the beauty punches, but the power difference is too great.
0:10:58|0:11:6|Xiao Yi and the others showed no signs of remorse. The beauty kicked and resisted, but her head was attacked from behind. She lost consciousness and fainted.
0:11:6|0:11:13|She couldn't remember what happened when she was unconscious, but when she woke up groggily, she found herself facing a handsome man.
0:11:16|0:11:22|The man is Yue Feng, he did not answer, and walked out of the alley with the water.
0:11:42|0:11:48|Soon after, at the edge of the Five Caves, two workers were using ropes to hoist furniture while a child was playing with a ball.
0:12:20|0:12:28|Coincidentally, the child's ball flew over and landed under the furniture, where it was in a dangerous position.
0:12:36|0:12:45|The rope broke, the heavy furniture rushed towards and fell down, at this moment, Yue Feng appeared, saved the child, and carried the child to the side, comforting him/her all over.
0:13:6|0:13:8|Took Yue Feng to the company's warehouse without hesitation.
0:13:17|0:13:25|After Pillow left, [Yue Feng] cautiously walked into the warehouse, straightened his body, and greeted the new job with enthusiasm.
0:13:25|0:13:30|At night, [Yue Feng] fell asleep wearily, and in his dream, he returned to the actions before he was imprisoned.
0:13:33|0:13:39|His mouth full of blood, hit hard on the head, [Yue Feng] suddenly woke up from a nightmare.
0:13:44|0:13:48|[Yue Feng] stood up and recalled the details of the duel from years ago.
0:13:48|0:13:56|He was surrounded and beaten by a group of people, so he stood up to practice martial arts, determined not to let such an opportunity happen again.
0:13:56|0:14:2|[Yue Feng] has not yet emerged from the state of being obsessed with sleep, he can still feel that inexplicable unease.
0:14:3|0:14:18|So he kept doing push-ups and getting up, trying to make himself stronger through training. The dangerous villa somewhat restricted his punches and kicks, causing him some injuries. He then swung his arms faster to increase the speed of his punches according to the law.
0:14:18|0:14:24|Even with his back against the wall, Yue Feng never stops his swift attacks and fierce fighting moves.
0:14:24|0:14:28|Under the influence of Han Ruo martial arts, he could finally feel the best state of the battle from years ago at a glance.
0:14:33|0:14:41|Yue Feng's punching speed becomes faster and the strength increases, protecting Xiao Yi in the morning sun formation.
0:14:41|0:14:46|In the blink of an eye, it was time for work, and [Yue Feng] arrived at the office on time.
0:14:46|0:14:52|Unexpectedly, [Skinny] and [Fatso] have arrived.
0:14:59|0:15:0|The Skinny guy kept staring at [Yue Feng].
0:15:10|0:15:12|[Yue Feng] glanced at the thin-lipped Wang Bo.
0:15:26|0:15:29|The two of them saw that [Yue Feng] had no reaction at all, and they became anxious immediately.
0:15:29|0:15:35|[Fatty] was beaten so badly that he became arrogant, [Yue Feng] asked, [Fatty] was stunned.
0:15:52|0:15:57|The Skinny guy reached out for the Fat guy's button, but the Fat guy quickly waved his hand and stood up.
0:16:39|0:16:57|[Fatty] patted [Yue Feng] on the back, then raised his hand, signaling with his eyes to [Skinny]. [Skinny] immediately understood and said, "Alright, let's kick and push [Yue Feng] away."
0:16:57|0:17:4|After work, [Yue Feng] held a crumpled note and followed it to a quiet street.
0:17:4|0:17:16|He looked around and finally his gaze landed on a small stall selling pancakes. The seller was an old granny, her eyes full of wounds, her face filled with the bitterness of life.
0:17:16|0:17:22|[Yue Feng] walked to the side and silently watched the old lady's stall.
0:17:22|0:17:27|Upon his release from prison, the prison guard had instructed Yue Feng to take the address he gave him, and Yue Feng fulfilled his promise.
0:17:39|0:17:42|The grandmother of the boy he killed has been found.
0:17:42|0:17:53|The melodious and sorrowful music came from afar, it turned out to be Kaizi playing the harmonica alone in the shop, reminiscing about childhood memories, full of reluctance and sorrow.
0:17:54|0:17:59|The melodious harmonica sound accompanied the boys as they ran away from their childhood.
0:17:59|0:18:6|The young Kai Zi punched and kicked the bad kids, forcing them into a corner, where they knelt down and hugged their bodies tightly.
0:18:6|0:18:11|Two teenagers arrived too late and kicked away the bullies who were picking on others.
0:18:11|0:18:15|These two are the brave Yue Feng and A Hai who stood up for justice when they were young.
0:18:16|0:18:21|Three young men formed a deep bond that would last a lifetime, growing up together.
0:18:21|0:18:25|The young man has grown up, but his companions are gradually drifting away.
0:18:29|0:18:33|As dusk fell, [Yue Feng] bought a large bag of pancakes from Pancake Granny.
0:18:34|0:18:45|Back home, his attention was immediately drawn to the harmonica and envelope on the table. [Yue Feng] recognized them as Kai's harmonica and the envelope with Kai's handwritten name next to it.
0:18:45|0:18:52|He opened the envelope and found a tower coin inside, while deep in the envelope was a childhood photo of three teenagers.
0:18:53|0:18:58|The three people in the photo are standing close together, with a young man who has not yet experienced everything beside them.
0:18:58|0:19:3|Now, everything has changed, and [Yue Feng] feels a sense of regret.
0:19:3|0:19:13|In a moment of melancholy, Yue Feng picked up his harmonica, walked slowly to the window, looked up at the moon, and under the moonlight's gaze, his thoughts drifted back to his childhood.
0:19:13|0:19:17|In their childhood, Kaizi also played the harmonica alone like [Yue Feng].
0:19:18|0:19:23|But unlike in the past, the three boys used to stick together and protect each other.
0:19:23|0:19:31|Now, Kaizi sat alone in the shop, drinking in silence, the cigarette still burning, while the stories of his youth had already come to an end.
0:19:31|0:19:34|They all stood alone, each on their own.
0:20:41|0:20:59|In the previous year, the joke spoken with high spirits turned into a punch, with a train roaring past behind, and a moving company's truck speeding by, forming a line that outlines the fading of youth.
0:20:59|0:21:1|[Yue Feng], along with two others, are transporting goods.
0:21:13|0:21:16|The fat guy struggled to move the computer and called out to [Yue Feng].
0:21:16|0:21:29|Surprisingly, the computer that he and the skinny guy couldn't move together, was carried away by [Yue Feng] alone.
0:21:29|0:21:36|[Yue Feng] carried his computer into the shelter, and as soon as he entered, his eyes were drawn to the scene in front of him, captivated and unable to move from his spot.
0:21:39|0:21:51|The scene shows several adorable children playing, running and jumping around in the yard. Two of them are playfully chasing each other.
0:21:51|0:21:58|The energetic children made [Yue Feng] feel warm and familiar, just like he used to be with [A Hai].
0:21:58|0:22:2|[Yue Feng] was momentarily stunned, lost in thought, and immersed in memories.
0:22:10|0:22:15|[Yue Feng] was brought back to reality by the fat man's call and continued to move the computer.
0:22:15|0:22:24|At this moment, only Fatso and Skinny are in the room. Skinny puts the computer on the ground, and Fatso reminds him.
0:22:24|0:22:33|Skinny lifted the computer case, while outside the window, a long-haired beauty stood up, a loud noise caught her attention, and Skinny accidentally dropped the computer.
0:22:37|0:22:44|After the fat guy finished cursing, he looked around, thinking no one was there, and didn't notice the beauty watching the whole process and leaving.
0:22:44|0:22:48|The two looked at the broken computer and walked out of the room, calling out to [Yue Feng].
0:22:55|0:23:4|Speak up, the fat guy and the skinny guy walked out, [Yue Feng] noticed the fat guy's unusual expression, but didn't think much of it, and walked into the inner room alone.
0:23:4|0:23:18|As soon as the computer case was lifted from the ground, the computer inside fell out of the cardboard box and landed heavily on the ground. The thin man and the fat man who came running at the sound looked very surprised.
0:23:18|0:23:21|The fat guy and the skinny guy are investigating outside the door, and the boss comes in.
0:23:26|0:23:31|[Yue Feng] stood still, saying nothing.
0:23:31|0:23:33|The beauty enters the room to break the siege.
0:23:33|0:23:44|The beauty looked at the ringleader, and then had dinner with [Yue Feng].
0:23:44|0:23:48|[Yue Feng] recognized that he was the girl he had saved.
0:24:14|0:24:16|This is a private shelter.
0:24:16|0:24:19|Mr. Zhou had no children of his own, and had originally just taken in two children.
0:24:21|0:24:23|The beauty shyly lowered her head and played with the coffee.
0:24:52|0:24:58|The beauty shyly looked at [Yue Feng], but the subtle atmosphere was interrupted by the ringing of the phone.
0:25:15|0:25:18|[Yue Feng] hung up the phone and then calmly looked at the beautiful woman.
0:25:28|0:25:38|The beauty borrowed Yue Feng's phone, left her phone number, and only returned the phone after confirming the call.
0:25:38|0:25:43|[Yue Feng] took the phone and left after answering.
0:25:43|0:25:45|In the billiard room, the fat guy and the skinny guy were scolded by Baldy.
0:26:6|0:26:7|The fat man with a swollen face nodded frantically.
0:26:42|0:26:48|Bald Head came to the next door excitedly, only to see [Yue Feng] empty-handed, with a disappointed look on his face.
0:26:56|0:26:58|Anger and a bottle smashed towards [Yue Feng]'s head.
0:27:0|0:27:4|Blood flowed down from the top of the head.
0:27:4|0:27:7|Baldy grabbed an empty bottle and smashed it on [Yue Feng]'s head.
0:27:7|0:27:10|Yue Feng spat out and kicked the bald head flying to the ground.
0:27:10|0:27:15|Wu Xia glared at the bald head, and in an instant, the wine bottle was crushed by [Yue Feng].
0:27:15|0:27:23|He asked coldly, the bald guy was so scared that he couldn't speak, the fat guy was taken away from the billiard room by the skinny guy and [Yue Feng].
0:27:43|0:27:51|The full moon hangs high in the sky, and the weary Yue Feng has long entered the realm of dreams peacefully.
0:27:51|0:27:54|Awakened from a deep sleep by the jarring ringtone of a cellphone.
0:27:54|0:27:59|[Yue Feng] turns on the night light, picks up his phone, and receives a text message from the beautiful woman in the afternoon.
0:28:5|0:28:7|After reading the text message, [Yue Feng] replied:
0:28:8|0:28:13|Only after sending it did he notice the name left by the beauty - [Xiao Yi].
0:28:13|0:28:17|Agreeing readily, but feeling uneasy afterwards.
0:28:17|0:28:24|Recalling the mistakes he made in his youth, [Yue Feng] still feels unsettled.
0:28:24|0:28:28|Originally, the rebellious youth who took on disciples back then was blocked by [Yue Feng].
0:28:31|0:28:38|He then learned his own kind tricks, wielding a weapon in one hand and kicking the enemy in the other.
0:28:46|0:28:53|After the life-and-death struggle with Milo, Yue Feng's energy was only half consumed.
0:28:53|0:28:56|The little Kun tigers attacked the house, and Yue Feng couldn't stop them.
0:28:58|0:29:3|After the Communist Party's rectification meeting, the strategy was adjusted to surround [Yue Feng].
0:29:3|0:29:9|[Yue Feng]'s shadow in the film is like a solitary island. Even when the people around him are surrounded, he still appears fierce.
0:29:10|0:29:11|The people around were so scared that their lips were trembling.
0:29:11|0:29:28|Under the command of the leader Xiao Yi, the other little souls flew up one after another to attack [Yue Feng].
0:29:28|0:29:30|[Yue Feng] counterattacks and defeats an opponent.
0:29:30|0:29:34|Yue Feng did not expect that the young master would sneak attack him from behind.
0:29:39|0:29:47|The heart that was required to go up the cliff was also holding Yue Yue's hands, and was lifted up.
0:29:47|0:29:50|This shot caused the sniper to insert into Yue Feng's body.
0:29:55|0:30:3|In the exclamation of the leading boy, [Yue Feng] stood still, with fear, confusion, astonishment, and worry flashing in his eyes.
0:30:3|0:30:20|He gazed at the young man lying on the ground, watching the person next to him unable to move, experiencing for the first time the horror of his own fist. The memories lingered like a nightmare, preventing him from falling asleep for a long time.
0:30:20|0:30:30|The next day, [Yue Feng] arrived early at the shelter, sitting on the playground, watching the children in front of him. Xiao Yi came out and sat next to him.
0:30:57|0:31:3|A young boy walked over holding a painting, [Yue Feng] took the painting, reached out to touch the boy's face, and asked.
0:31:5|0:31:7|His name is Xiao Qiang, a deaf-mute child.
0:31:8|0:31:15|[Yue Feng] lowered his head slightly, feeling a bit sorry, as he admired the boy's painting. With innocent strokes, the painting depicted a happy family of three.
0:31:15|0:31:22|In the painting, the little boy holding his parents' hands captivated Yue Feng, reminding him of his own father.
0:32:3|0:32:4|Their eyes met, and the father was stunned.
0:32:28|0:32:35|The father threw the hot water pot and also threw [Yue Feng] back to reality, leaving his heart unsettled for a long time.
0:32:35|0:32:42|The deafening noise swept away the tranquility of the shelter. Xiao Yi stood up and blocked the menacing men.
0:32:45|0:32:50|The leading burly man stared fiercely at Xiao Yi, and the principal walked out.
0:32:52|0:33:5|The burly men then swaggered into the inner room one by one, looking fierce and menacing, while giving Xiao Yi a flirtatious glare. Xiao Yi pretended not to notice.
0:33:5|0:33:10|After entering the room, one of the men in a floral jacket said to the principal,
0:33:26|0:33:30|The leader stopped the strong man's fist, walked slowly towards him, and said,
0:33:47|0:33:54|As they were leaving, the leader glanced at [Yue Feng], a hint of disdain flashed in [Yue Feng]'s eyes, then he immediately lowered his eyelids.
0:33:54|0:34:7|Xiao Yi ran up to the headmaster to ask as she watched the burly men leave. Seeing the men walking away in the distance outside the window, the headmaster sighed, took off his glasses, and nodded helplessly.
0:34:36|0:34:53|Speak up, he lowered his eyes, the three of them showing endless worries in their eyes. As night fell, an Audi with a red logo swayed and rushed towards the old lady crossing the road. On the other side of the road, [Yue Feng] took a big step and crossed over, considering the old lady, causing the car to stop abruptly.
0:34:53|0:35:1|After speaking, Yue Feng left, leaving the auntie and the Audi owner standing there. The Audi owner, who was drunk, got out from under the car door and asked.
0:35:7|0:35:14|[Yue Feng] walked through the dark alley, where a familiar figure was waiting for him under the tree.
0:35:14|0:35:23|[A Hai] leaned against the tree in loneliness, unable to contain his anticipation and joy, leaving the long-lost brothers speechless.
0:35:23|0:35:29|A thousand words turned into familiar fist bumps, and joy turned into the steam rising from the hotpot.
0:35:29|0:35:31|The brothers met in the hotpot restaurant to catch up.
0:35:37|0:35:42|[A Hai] took a deep breath, as if he had made up his mind.
0:36:30|0:36:43|The contrast between the silent duo and the boiling sound of the hotpot highlights the complete difference between the two due to the estrangement in their lives.
0:36:43|0:36:45|The two clinked glasses, and the hotpot started to boil.
0:36:45|0:36:54|After having their fill of food and drink, the two drunken individuals stumbled out of the restaurant, supporting each other as they walked unsteadily.
0:36:54|0:36:58|[A Hai] sent [Yue Feng] to the door and hailed a taxi.
0:37:0|0:37:3|The taxi stopped by the roadside, and the two held hands to bid farewell.
0:37:4|0:37:10|[A Hai] opened the car door, and [Yue Feng] leaned his head into the car. As soon as he saw the driver's face, he was stunned.
0:37:10|0:37:17|Seeing who it was, the driver frowned, stepped on the gas pedal, and drove the car far away without waiting for [Yue Feng] to react.
0:37:17|0:37:27|[A Hai] shouted discontentedly, the driver followed the path, saw [Yue Feng] standing still, a complex emotion flashed through his heart, and he continued to drive forward indifferently.
0:37:27|0:37:33|The next morning, [Yue Feng] arrived at the pancake stall as usual to take care of the old lady's business.
0:38:22|0:38:29|Yue Feng bent down as Granny Fang placed the stool on the cart, saying, "Let's pull the cart together and move forward."
0:38:44|0:38:49|The old volunteer fainted upon seeing the bloody animal head at the door, and everyone rushed to the hospital.
0:39:17|0:39:20|Auntie feels sorry.
0:39:23|0:39:33|I think, say it, [Yue Feng] lowered his head in contemplation, his gaze following along the hospital room.
0:39:33|0:39:38|Principal stood in front of the hospital bed, rubbing his eyes with a worried look on his face.
0:39:38|0:39:42|In this scene, [Yue Feng] made up his mind.
0:39:42|0:39:46|On the other side, the Shao Dong family is still plotting their acquisition plan.
0:40:10|0:40:15|Yue Feng's eyes were filled with unfathomable desire as he swirled his wine glass, then he spoke slowly.
0:40:21|0:40:26|Henchman [A Long] stood expressionless, while the young master smoked a cigar and changed the subject.
0:40:26|0:40:27|[A Long] nodded in response, having a clear idea.
0:40:48|0:40:58|[A Long] immediately took people to the shelter, sneaked into the night, smashed the glass, and rushed towards the children.
0:40:58|0:41:15|Principal hurried over to comfort them, carrying the child into the house, and the children swarmed around the principal.
0:41:25|0:41:30|The children were wrapped in a big blanket by the headmaster and fell asleep peacefully.
0:41:30|0:41:34|The next day, [Yue Feng] and the principal cleaned up the mess, while [Xiao Yi] comforted the children.
0:42:0|0:42:9|Xiao Yi took a deep breath and smashed the round-legged man with a kick to the leg, with a huge difference in strength.
0:42:9|0:42:15|[Yue Feng] witnessed everything in the room.
0:42:15|0:42:20|[Yue Feng], with a murderous aura never seen since his release from prison, walked towards the gangsters and said:
0:42:24|0:42:34|[Yue Feng] spat out, kicked the first step, reflected the strong man, and other people kept trying to move forward, but were knocked down by [Yue Feng]'s fast whirlwind ladder kicks.
0:42:34|0:42:36|The strong men were stunned in fear.
0:42:36|0:42:42|The leading man in a floral jacket continued to advance and attack with the man next to him.
0:42:42|0:42:43|The burly man executed a set of fancy punches and kicks.
0:42:45|0:42:52|The viewers were dazzled, and finally someone took out a brick, but was kicked back underground by [Yue Feng].
0:42:52|0:43:2|The muscular man in a floral jacket, unwilling to show weakness, rushed forward to the boxing stick. [Yue Feng] punched and spat, making it difficult for him to move.
0:43:2|0:43:6|The burly man fled in panic, and the shelter returned to its former calm.
0:43:38|0:43:43|Principal earnestly entrusted the two, with [Duan Hanqiang] in charge of practicing martial arts.
0:44:26|0:44:43|The burly man in a floral jacket just left, and the bald man walked over. [A Long] approached and whispered to the bald man, patting his shoulder trustingly. They entered the police station and went to the underground garage, where [Yue Feng] and [Xiao Yi] were.
0:44:55|0:45:3|[Xiao Yi] opened the door, [Yue Feng] put down his things, but didn't get in the car.
0:45:23|0:45:37|[Yue Feng] saw two people hiding suspiciously next to the car across the street through the car window. He immediately became alert and gently persuaded [Xiao Yi] to get into the car first.
0:45:37|0:45:42|Xiao Yi, full of anticipation, was knocked unconscious from behind by Yue Feng and fell into the car.
0:45:42|0:45:48|Yue Feng carefully laid Xiao Yi in the car, then stood up and faced the criminals hiding in the dark.
0:45:49|0:45:57|About ten people approached, fully armed, their faces obscured. They all held sharp blades, wearing masks and surrounding [Yue Feng].
0:45:57|0:46:7|The battle officially begins, with a thug rushing towards [Yue Feng] with a short knife. [Yue Feng] reacts quickly, and as the thug approaches with the blade, he swiftly knocks him down.
0:46:9|0:46:14|[Sung Daifu] repeatedly raised the sword to attack [Yue Feng], taking turns in the battle.
0:46:14|0:46:18|[Yue Feng] is also not straightforward, avoiding Ling Yan multiple times and resisting firmly.
0:46:20|0:46:26|[Yue Feng] did not notice the sneak attack from the side with a dog knife while confronting the thugs in front of him, and his arm was scratched.
0:46:29|0:46:42|Realizing that fighting off the numerous disciples with bare hands is not a solution, [Yue Feng] had to wait for the right moment, swiftly shot and escaped as the disciples relaxed their guard, running deeper into the garage.
0:46:42|0:46:47|Father-in-law's family still didn't dare to give up easily, chasing after Yue Feng down the hill, running to the iron gate.
0:46:48|0:46:54|[Yue Feng] was forced into a corner, surrounded once again by a group of thugs.
0:46:54|0:47:1|[Yue Feng] looked around to assess the situation, resisting the attacks from the thugs, and noticed the iron chain hanging above the iron gate.
0:47:1|0:47:7|In the next moment, [Yue Feng] swung the iron chain, knocking down everyone and turning the situation around.
0:47:7|0:47:17|Yue Feng was playing with a spinning top at the entrance of the shelter, when two masked men hurriedly got off a truck and took the boy into the vehicle, leaving the spinning top behind.
0:47:19|0:47:31|In the aunt's house, [Yue Feng] stayed close to the aunt, biting on gauze and struggling to deal with the large cut on his arm, bandaging the wound on his arm alone.
0:47:31|0:47:34|Auntie woke up, feeling very worried, and got up to say to [Yue Feng],
0:48:6|0:48:13|[Yue Feng] walked towards the door, while Xiao Yi reluctantly got up.
0:48:13|0:48:16|[Yue Feng] smiled knowingly and said.
0:48:19|0:48:26|[Xiao Yi] nervously bites her lower lip, watching [Yue Feng] leave with reluctance.
0:48:26|0:48:37|While waiting at the traffic lights, [Yue Feng] sees a boy struggling inside a truck, and upon closer inspection, realizes that it is a child from the orphanage.
0:48:37|0:48:41|Yue Feng was in a hurry, chasing after the truck on foot.
0:48:41|0:48:48|He paid no attention to the crowd or the wheels, solely focused on rescuing the child as quickly as possible. The criminal took the child to a mysterious warehouse.
0:48:55|0:49:3|The child struggled desperately as several men held down the child's limbs.
0:49:3|0:49:9|The villain was about to make a move, but was hit by the flying motherboard from outside the door. [Yue Feng] approached with a murderous intent step by step.
0:49:17|0:49:20|The thug charged at [Yue Feng], but was kicked down by [Yue Feng].
0:49:20|0:49:30|[Yue Feng] knocked down three thugs to the ground, still not satisfied, he stepped forward to block the thugs' weapons, even grabbed the thug's collar and threw him to the ground.
0:49:30|0:49:37|After several thugs were subdued, the bald one held up a wooden board to shield Yue Feng, and then punched him in the head.
0:49:37|0:49:51|[Yue Feng] holds up the wooden board with his arms, lifts it over his head to counterattack, pushes the bald man against the wall, walks while knocking on the board, and eventually creates a large hole in the board.
0:49:51|0:50:0|Baldy was powerless to resist, and was thrown to the other corner of the wall. [Yue Feng] mounted him and beat him to death.
0:50:0|0:50:7|The worried principal, holding his head, saw [Yue Feng] of the Hanliu generation coming back with a child.
0:50:7|0:50:8|Yue Feng puts the child on the bed.
0:50:10|0:50:13|The principal quickly followed.
0:50:13|0:50:18|The little boy furrowed his brow, but he slept deeply because he had been busy all day.
0:50:18|0:50:22|The adult walked out of the room, [Yue Feng] closed the door, and the principal said angrily.
0:50:39|0:50:43|[Yue Feng] left, and the principal was worried in the garden.
0:50:43|0:50:47|In the boxing gym, Li Shao's henchmen were knocked down by the boxers in the gym.
0:51:11|0:51:18|[Li Shao] fell into a memory, back then, he held a gun and pointed it at the bruised [A Hai], threatening him.
0:51:27|0:51:31|[A Hai], who was tortured, couldn't open his eyes and had a weak breath.
0:51:31|0:51:39|In his memory, [Li Shao] returned to the real boxing gym, where a man in black delivered a mysterious message. His men were defeated and lay on the ground, unable to get up.
0:52:5|0:52:9|The next day, [Li Shao] and his men forcefully broke into the shelter.
0:52:19|0:52:23|[Li Shao] pulled out a chair and sat down.
0:52:47|0:53:9|Yue Feng's Feishui enters Luocheng, and another judge, Wang Bo, steps up, the situation is already ruthless.
0:53:9|0:53:15|[Li Shao] signaled the main character to stop, looking satisfied at [Yue Feng], while [A Long] looked maliciously at [Yue Feng].
0:53:19|0:53:22|[Li Shao] looked [Yue Feng] up and down, and smirked cunningly.
0:53:22|0:53:24|Xiao Yi walked over one after another.
0:53:47|0:53:51|After unilaterally declaring war, [Li Shao] left in a car and said inside the car.
0:53:59|0:54:1|Inside the shelter, the director said.
0:54:26|0:54:30|Outside the door, Xiao Yi accompanied Yue Feng, who was full of pride and deep in thought.
0:54:30|0:54:34|At night, Xiao Yi drove [Yue Feng] home and said in the car.
0:54:43|0:54:51|[Yue Feng] looked out the window expressionlessly, while Xiao Yi turned her head in surprise at Yue Feng's calmness, but not astonishment.
0:56:44|0:56:50|Yue Feng hadn't even opened the car door when Xiao Yi's hand was placed on top of Yue Feng's hand resting on his leg.
0:56:50|0:56:55|[Yue Feng] raises Xiao Yi's hand with his other hand and then pulls his own hand away.
0:56:55|0:57:0|There was a long silence in the car, with the corners of their mouths twitching slightly, please ignore.
0:57:0|0:57:5|[Yue Feng] avoids Xiao Yi's eyes, pushes open the car door and steps out, while Xiao Yi smiles inside the car.
0:57:6|0:57:16|Yue Feng, holding the key to open the door, felt the gaze behind him. He turned around and saw Xiao Yi waving at him, their eyes meeting as he waved back.
0:57:16|0:57:22|After entering the house, [Xiao Yi] still reluctantly looked through the window.
0:57:22|0:57:29|Late at night, [Xiao Yi] and [Yue Feng] signed a life-and-death contract.
0:57:29|0:57:32|To defend the shelter, [Yue Feng] went to the battlefield alone.
0:57:33|0:57:42|Facing off against the professional boxers brought by [Li Shao], the underlings of [Li Shao] were eager to give it a try, rubbing their hands in anticipation of the spectacle.
0:57:42|0:57:53|Wearing a coat and a hat, the boxer walked out from the team and stared straight at [Yue Feng], like a fierce beast eyeing its prey, their eyes locked in silence.
0:57:53|0:58:0|The two cautiously circled each other, determination shining in [Yue Feng]'s eyes as he moved in to attack.
0:58:0|0:58:5|The boxer took the initiative to probe, throwing punches and kicks, all of which were caught by [Yue Feng].
0:58:5|0:58:12|After learning about Yue Feng's strength, the boxer gradually unleashed his punching power, revealing his true nature.
0:58:12|0:58:27|However, [Yue Feng] did not show his strength, but was kicked away by [Yue Feng]. After taking a few steps back, he patted the dust off his coat, fortunately he was prepared for defense. At this moment, he adjusted his position, moved around from side to side, and after identifying the opponent's weakness, he launched a fierce attack.
0:58:27|0:58:32|[Yue Feng] was blocked at the chin, stepped back tightly, using retreat as advance, with a defensive and elusive strategy.
0:58:32|0:58:38|The boxer did not hit the target, but instead skillfully turned defense into offense in an instant.
0:58:38|0:58:40|The fist strikes rapidly, but the corpse remains unaffected.
0:58:41|0:59:2|[Yue Feng] dodged the boxer's attack, twisted his body and kicked the boxer in the stomach. While the boxer was kicked away, his waistband was grabbed by [Yue Feng]. [Yue Feng] then put the luggage on the ground and almost cooperated with the boxer. As the boxer turned around from behind, his movements were suppressed by [Yue Feng], making it impossible for him to dodge or avoid.
0:59:2|0:59:11|[Yue Feng] turned around with the posture of a victor, [Li Shao] with a gloomy face, and the mysterious man sat in the shadows, recalling the scene where [Li Shao] approached him.
0:59:18|0:59:39|The scene shifts, [Li Shao] enters as the second boxer, exchanging high-fives and cheers to dispel the previous gloom. The second boxer stretches his muscles, looking very arrogant, his confident and calm demeanor forming a sharp contrast with [Yue Feng]. He approaches [Yue Feng], taunting with a raised hand, then immediately throws a punch.
0:59:45|0:59:50|His punching and kicking speed is extremely fast, and [Yue Feng] is having some difficulty defending.
0:59:50|0:59:54|[Li Shao] and the boxer revealed the outstanding performance that was bound to win.
0:59:57|1:0:6|At this moment, the boxer was feeling complacent and lost control, jumping up several times to attack. [Yue Feng] took advantage of the situation to launch a counterattack with the organized boxing technique.
1:0:6|1:0:13|After a few rounds of confrontation, they adopted independent boxing stances and switched to close combat, grabbing each other's belts.
1:0:13|1:0:21|The boxer pressed on step by step, [Yue Feng] tried to grab the boxer's arm to throw him down, but was outsmarted by the boxer.
1:0:21|1:0:29|The boxer grabbed [Yue Feng] around the waist and slammed him heavily to the ground from behind, "You gave me my life, just say what you want!"
1:0:58|1:1:18|Memories and reality intertwine, accompanied by sighs. The man returns to reality, only to see [Yue Feng] grabbing the boxer's foot, spinning it around and throwing it aside. The boxer kicks [Yue Feng] away, and [Yue Feng] kicks with a fiery foot, creating distance as the boxer angrily tears off his jacket.
1:1:18|1:1:42|[Yue Feng] also took off his jacket. [Xiao Yi] was about to raise his hand, but the camera shifted back to the confrontation scene. Yue Feng charged out again, kicking the boxer onto a pile of goods, rapidly throwing punches at him. Finally, he delivered a kick to the boxer's face, knocking him down and dealing with the troublesome enemy. [Yue Feng] looked breathlessly at [Xiao Yi].
1:1:42|1:1:45|[Li Shao] smirked sinisterly, clapping his hands as he stood up.
1:1:45|1:1:50|In the shadows, a mysterious man silently watches everything, secretly competing.
1:1:50|1:1:54|All the henchmen stood up and slowly approached behind [Yue Feng].
1:1:54|1:1:59|The mysterious man slowly walked into Yue Feng's field of vision from behind Li Shao and A Long.
1:1:59|1:2:5|When their eyes met, [Yue Feng] stood in shock, staring at the familiar face in front of him, [A Hai].
1:2:6|1:2:28|A Hai's eyes were full of complex emotions, Yue Feng looked worried, the two brothers stared at each other for a long time, and A Hai spoke.
1:2:28|1:2:31|Li Shao stood up ominously and whispered behind A Hai in the dark.
1:2:38|1:2:44|A Hai obeyed and was replaced by the professional killer [A Long], who launched the first attack from the side.
1:2:54|1:3:6|[Li Shao] puzzled about the relationship between the two, the actor who lowered his head, flashed a vague side profile, [A Hai] reached for [Yue Feng]'s chin, [Yue Feng] took a heavy blow, feeling unsteady, [A Hai] swung his fist and rushed in, vaguely recalling the past.
1:3:10|1:3:20|Thinking back to the past, the two brothers played until they bumped fists, with [A Hai]'s fist hanging in the air, stopping in front of [Yue Feng], who was amazed.
1:3:20|1:3:40|[Li Shao] met the stern gaze of [A Long] from the side, then stared firmly at the approaching [A Hai]. Under [Li Shao]'s intense glare, [A Hai] spoke slowly and deliberately. [Li Shao] lowered his eyes, hiding a fleeting look of astonishment, then raised them again, suppressing his anger.
1:3:40|1:3:48|[Li Shao] stared at [A Hai], who leisurely stood up. The deep eyes revealed no emotions, instead, a sly smile played on his face.
1:3:48|1:3:54|[Li Shao] used his weapon to strike at [A Hai]'s abdomen, glaring at [A Hai]. [A Hai] blocked [Yue Feng] and demanded [Li Shao].
1:3:57|1:4:12|[Li Shao] flashed a mysterious smile on his inscrutable face, staring at [A Hai] and [Yue Feng]. Slowly, he picked up the life-and-death contract signed with [Yue Feng] earlier and tore it into pieces in front of everyone's eyes.
1:4:12|1:4:18|The burly men under [Li Shao] stared fiercely at [Yue Feng] and [A Hai], blocking their way out.
1:4:18|1:4:24|Li Shao angrily shouted, after taking A Hai home, Yue Feng asked.
1:4:42|1:4:45|Lying down, [A Hai] looked up at the ceiling, shaking his head in confusion.
1:4:53|1:4:57|Yue Feng, with a worried look on his face, holds A Hai's hand with deep concern.
1:5:3|1:5:10|One day, as the sun rose and dispelled the gloom, [Yue Feng] bid farewell to the shelter and left. Xiao Yi chased after him from the door, her eyes red with tears.
1:5:18|1:5:20|[Yue Feng] stood still, frowning.
1:5:24|1:5:34|Auntie stood at the door, her eyes blurred, watching as [Yue Feng] bid farewell to the children.
1:5:34|1:5:41|The child circled around the west, reluctant to leave, as [Yue Feng] bid farewell, tears flowing from Xiao Yi's moist eyes, filled with deep sorrow.
1:5:41|1:5:48|Auntie Xiao Yi looked at [Yue Feng] walking away with a backpack on one shoulder without looking back, tears streaming down her face.
1:5:48|1:5:50|In the billiard room, [A Long] says to [Li Shao].
1:6:18|1:6:29|[Li Shao]’s eyes flashed with a glimmer of light, coming up with a new idea. He bent down, aimed at the cue ball, and struck it hard, sending the ball into the pocket.
1:6:29|1:6:37|The next day, as [Yue Feng]'s father-in-law opened the taxi door, he was dragged out and brutally beaten by a strong man who caught up from behind.
1:6:38|1:6:51|Yue Feng, returning home with his backpack, saw this scene from a distance and rushed towards the man attacking his father, scaring the tough guys into scrambling to escape.
1:6:51|1:6:54|Yue Feng's father, whose face was covered in injuries from being beaten, asked.
1:6:57|1:7:3|Who knew the father did not appreciate it, wiped the blood off his face, and pushed [Yue Feng] away.
1:7:3|1:7:12|[Yue Feng] tightly grasped his father's arm, and after his father entered the room, he prepared cotton balls on the table. His father gently moved his right arm and asked.
1:7:12|1:7:16|The father and [Yue Feng] both lowered their heads, not looking at each other.
1:7:16|1:7:26|[Yue Feng] propped up his father's shoulder, holding a cotton ball ready to apply medicine for his father. He carefully held his father's left hand with one hand, and gently wiped his father's right temple with the other.
1:7:27|1:7:31|The next moment, the father snatched the cotton ball and shook off [Yue Feng]'s hand.
1:7:36|1:7:38|The father was the first to break the silence.
1:7:59|1:8:6|After listening to his father's teachings, [Yue Feng] raised his head, furrowed his brows slightly, and walked out of the house impatiently.
1:8:6|1:8:13|The father, with a soft heart, looked at his child's departing figure with reluctance on his face, standing up but not knowing what he could do.
1:8:13|1:8:21|[Yue Feng] was walking in this city that isolated himself from the outside world, blowing in the cold wind. He arrived at the Pancake Granny's stall, knowing that night had fallen.
1:8:26|1:8:29|The granny reached out her hands and straightened a hat for [Yue Feng].
1:9:3|1:9:18|An old man and a young boy leaning against the roadside, the scene shifts to the director's shelter, where several men dressed in dark clothes break in, their faces unclear. [Yue Feng] sits outside the operating room, his face full of worry. A nurse walks out and, looking down the corridor, speaks up.
1:9:21|1:9:29|[Yue Feng] stood up and walked towards the nurse.
1:9:29|1:9:40|When Nurse Mu left, [Yue Feng] turned around in self-blame, and his phone suddenly rang. He answered it with concern.
1:9:40|1:9:46|The faint morning light, [Yue Feng] stood on the familiar rooftop terrace, pacing with difficulty.
1:9:51|1:9:57|Memories flow between past experiences, constantly rewinding, rewinding back to the starting point.
1:9:57|1:10:10|In a daze, still in a showdown with [A Hai], [A Hai]'s suspended fist, the iron rod that [Li Shao] struck on [A Hai], in the blink of an eye, turned into sticks being hammered on the father by everyone.
1:10:18|1:10:25|Fear, unease, worry, tenderness, and heartbreak all surged up in the heart.
1:10:25|1:10:29|Complex emotions intertwined, pulling Yue Feng back to reality.
1:10:31|1:10:48|Wearing the training jacket for the showdown with Yan Shao, [Yue Feng] seemed to be putting on his armor, walking proudly from the darkness into the light, looking down on everything in front of him. He arrived at the warehouse, ready to fight to the death with Li Shao's men and rescue the principal.
1:10:50|1:10:58|In the warehouse, more than twenty criminals, all armed with iron rods and steel pipes, were eager to fight and stared fiercely at [Yue Feng] who came to challenge them.
1:11:35|1:11:41|The dual-headed state stands beside the second floor, everyone is injured, and the axe shield at the bottom of the stairs rushes towards [Yue Feng].
1:11:41|1:11:52|[Yue Feng] was not smooth at all, despising the world, using flying kicks against the approaching second-level state, everyone couldn't get close to [Yue Feng]'s body at all.
1:11:52|1:11:57|[Yue Feng] didn't even throw a punch, he used the tornado chop and took care of everyone himself.
1:12:54|1:13:1|Surrounded by burly men like a proud eagle, [Yue Feng] was encircled layer by layer, yet no one dared to approach him.
1:13:1|1:13:8|Trembling, [Yue Feng] stared at the bald strong man, who glared angrily at everything in front of him and could no longer sit still.
1:13:8|1:13:15|Yue Feng rushed forward with three steps and a leap, his punches and kicks were extremely fast, but he was knocked down by a kick from [Yue Feng].
1:13:15|1:13:18|The strong man, determined, got up and continued to attack.
1:13:18|1:13:23|[Yue Feng] lifted him up and slammed him heavily to the ground from behind.
1:13:23|1:13:26|The angry strong man made others shout out:
1:13:40|1:13:47|No one dared to hurt him. Only Yue Feng managed to defeat all those who were under the control of Walu Yu.
1:13:47|1:13:56|At this moment, Guangze rebels raised the wooden board and struck at the back of [Yue Feng], counterattacking the Bible Yuecheng old Fan, and the bald man called for others.
1:14:32|1:14:38|Without climbing a single brick, fiercely gunning down the intruder's head in pursuit, not knocking down a single person.
1:14:38|1:14:46|Yue Feng is facing the attackers, holding a two-meter-long beard-shaped stick and rushing towards Yue Feng from a distance, stabbing at his abdomen.
1:14:47|1:15:1|Yue Feng lay on the abandoned sofa, the bald strong man with grievances. Yue Feng grabbed the long stick, exerted all his strength, snatched the stick, and retaliated in kind. The bald strong man was instantly thrown into the air.
1:15:2|1:15:8|The burly men around were all knocked down by long sticks, unable to get up.
1:15:8|1:15:15|[A Long] stood at a high place, looking down, as their eyes met, [Yue Feng] flashed a victorious smile and dropped the long stick.
1:15:15|1:15:22|At this critical moment of life and death, the bald strong man picked up the long blade beside him and used his last bit of strength to strike at [Yue Feng].
1:15:23|1:15:29|Chang Ren was easily taken over by [Yue Feng] and the bald strong man fell to the ground and couldn't get up.
1:15:53|1:15:58|The attacker exerted a certain amount of force, approaching the forwarding situation and stepping into the sunlight.
1:15:58|1:16:3|[A Long] felt that the force was not enough, and he struck the dough next to him with force.
1:16:3|1:16:8|The force was so great that the wooden board shattered into pieces, and then quickly chopped towards [Yue Feng].
1:16:8|1:16:15|[Yue Feng], cornered, suddenly kicked [A Long], sending him flying three meters away.
1:16:15|1:16:18|The two adjusted their positions, clenched their fists, and assumed a fighting stance.
1:16:39|1:17:0|[A Long] immediately flew down, wielding his dragon blade. [Yue Feng] dodged from a distance, as A Long continued his upward strikes, accelerating the speed of his blade. A few times, A Long's strikes missed and hit the surrounding fixed objects. The speed of their moves increased, dazzling the onlookers. A Long kept striking, aiming at [Yue Feng]'s face. [Yue Feng] bent backwards to dodge a blow.
1:17:3|1:17:12|After getting up, Yue Feng swiftly swung his knife, slashing A Long's left arm. A Long winced in pain, struggling to switch the way he held the knife.
1:17:13|1:17:35|[Yue Feng] swung his knife towards [A Long]'s waist, leaving a wound without any resistance from [A Long]. He stood still, holding his injured waist in pain, but still fought desperately. Blood flowed from his right waist, a fierce look on his face. [A Long] used his injured left hand to support his right waist, while his right hand struggled to block [Yue Feng]'s attacks, being forced to retreat step by step.
1:17:35|1:17:39|When approaching the wall, [Yue Feng] kicked and knocked [A Long] down to the ground.
1:17:40|1:17:50|[A Long] struggled to stand up, but failed. He carefully picked up the long knife beside his feet, trying to use it for support, but still failed.
1:18:0|1:18:13|[Yue Feng] threw down the long blade in his hand, turned to look at the people he had knocked down, and ran into the warehouse. The principal was tied up in the middle of the warehouse, unable to move, with his mouth gagged with cotton cloth, unable to speak.
1:18:13|1:18:19|[Yue Feng] ran forward, untying the rope that bound the principal.
1:18:27|1:18:31|Li Shao sneaked out from behind the box and approached the two of them.
1:18:31|1:18:37|[Yue Feng] ignored the principal's concerns, glared at [Li Shao], and stood up.
1:18:37|1:18:39|Li Shao impatiently fired at [Yue Feng].
1:19:0|1:19:6|[Yue Feng] suddenly grabbed the gun in [Xiao Li]'s right hand, then swiftly turned his body and aimed the gun at [Xiao Li].
1:19:6|1:19:11|Accidentally fired, a gunshot rang out, hitting [Li Shao] in a vital spot.
1:19:11|1:19:14|[Li Shao] supported his lower back and sat down on the ground.
1:19:14|1:19:19|Yue Feng stood by, shocked, as he looked at his left hand which had accidentally fired the gun.
1:19:19|1:19:26|Feeling the warmth in his heart, [Yue Feng] collapsed to the ground with a blurry consciousness, after being shot in the left arm by [Li Shao].
1:20:3|1:20:8|Speak up, [Xiao Yi] grabbed the mesh fence behind him with both hands, as he stood up and spoke.
1:20:13|1:20:16|As soon as the words fell, the scene cut to the hospital.
1:20:16|1:20:26|[Yue Feng] lay on the hospital bed, his consciousness hazy. Slowly opening his eyes, he realized that it was just a dream. He noticed Xiao Yi, the little nurse, anxiously watching over him by the bed, softly asking him.
1:20:37|1:20:40|A police officer in uniform walks into the hospital room.
1:20:44|1:20:47|We walk out of the ward as the camera follows.
1:20:47|1:20:50|One month later.
1:20:50|1:20:55|Following the perspective of [Yue Feng], we arrive at the doorstep of [Yue Feng]'s father's house.
1:20:55|1:21:0|Father-in-law is wiping the carriage.
1:21:0|1:21:7|After bidding farewell with warmth, the father continued to happily clean the car, then drove the taxi to start a new day of work.
1:21:9|1:21:33|Yue Feng still reluctantly watched his father drive away, then slowly walked out of the alley, holding the flowers and gift box he bought for his aunt. As he walked through the crowd and traffic, when he reached a deeper area, Yue Feng noticed a car in the distance with eyes watching him from the rear side. When he turned around, he didn't see anything unusual, so Yue Feng continued walking into the parking lot.
1:22:2|1:22:8|In the memory, [Yue Feng] nodded with joy, but in reality, he remained unconscious.
1:22:8|1:22:18|Auntie said, a delicate silver necklace slipped from his hand, with a pattern of a bear eagle spreading its wings, which deeply moved [Yue Feng].
1:22:18|1:22:25|The two stood on the bridge, looking out at the river, standing closely together, the scene appeared very harmonious and happy.
1:22:27|1:22:40|The scene cuts back to reality, Yue Feng's phone drops to the side. Yue Feng hazily remembers Xiao Yi gently putting a necklace on him.
1:22:40|1:22:46|The sudden ringing of the phone did not bring the unconscious Yue Feng back to reality, the caller ID showed that it was Xiao Yi.
1:22:48|1:22:53|Yue Feng lay on the ground, still wearing the eagle necklace that Xiao Yi gave her around her neck.
1:22:53|1:23:1|The soaring eagle in the sky symbolizes Yue Feng, also the Yue Feng in Xiao Yi's heart.
1:23:1|1:23:2|Legend.
1:23:2|1:23:9|The eagle is the bird with the longest lifespan in the world. When it reaches halfway through its life, it must fly to a cliff.
1:23:10|1:23:18|Using rocks to shatter the old meeting that bends like a sickle, using wisdom to pull out the already aged nails, and plucking off the heavy and useless old words.
1:23:18|1:23:22|He can only fly again with renewed strength and determination.
1:23:22|1:23:27|He risks the danger of being in pain and starving to bid farewell to the past.
1:23:27|1:23:29|This process is called rebirth.
