0:1:42|0:1:49|Several men tied big paper flowers to the dung bucket, and the surrounding crowd looked happy. There were also reporters on site filming the scene.
0:2:31|0:2:34|We will never see the worker carrying a bucket of manure on his back again.
0:2:57|0:3:3|So, [Shi Chuanxiang], a third-generation night soil man, had to carry the feces out in buckets from here.
0:3:32|0:3:35|The students rushed forward and gathered around the dung barrel, playing and laughing.
0:3:35|0:3:40|[Shi Chuanxiang] and the janitors walked towards the new type of cleaning vehicle carrying buckets of excrement.
0:3:40|0:3:43|They had happy smiles on their faces.
0:3:43|0:3:46|[Shi Chuanxiang] puts down the bucket of manure and smiles as she watches the children beside her.
0:3:46|0:3:50|She walked through the crowd and noticed the Liberation Teacher in the distance.
0:3:50|0:3:54|Shi Chuanxiang stands under the sun, staring blankly into the distance.
0:3:54|0:3:56|[Shi Chunli] walked up to him and asked.
0:4:1|0:4:5|She looked at the run-down toilet in front of her and said to [Shi Chuanxiang].
0:4:5|0:4:16|She couldn't help but fall into memories. On a cold winter day, still in the fortress, she was abandoned at the door of this toilet, sitting alone on the cold stone bench, crying loudly.
0:4:16|0:4:21|In her memory, she looked at the half-broken toilet in front of her, tears streaming down her face.
0:4:31|0:4:36|A off-road vehicle is driving, and the green belts on both sides of the road are neatly trimmed.
0:4:36|0:4:39|At this moment, Lawyer Fang received a phone call.
0:7:5|0:7:18|The old lady was lost in memories. When she was young, she worked at the Liu family's house. On this day, she was washing clothes in the courtyard, lifting them out of the basin, wringing them dry, shaking them up and down, and hanging them on the rope. At that moment, a man's voice could be heard outside the door.
0:7:35|0:7:41|Yingzi nodded, turned to start tidying up, she gathered the clothes on the rope and said to [Shi Chuanxiang] at the door.
0:7:44|0:7:49|[Shi Chuanxiang] is wearing patched clothes and carrying a heavy bucket of manure as he quickly walks towards the courtyard.
0:7:49|0:7:55|Yingzi saw him so loyal and honest, so she went into the house, filled a bowl of water, and carried it out, calling out to [Shi Chuanxiang].
0:8:7|0:8:13|Mrs. Liu snatched the bowl from Shi Chuanxiang's hand and poured the water into the cat's bowl on the ground, leaving Cui Xiuting in disbelief.
0:8:13|0:8:15|At this moment, [Shi Chuanxiang] walked over.
0:8:24|0:8:27|Mrs. Liu pointed to the cat bowl and said to [Shi Chuanxiang],
0:8:27|0:8:32|[Shi Chuanxiang] looked at the cat bowl floating with fish bones, feeling furious with eyes full of anger.
0:8:32|0:8:36|[Shi Chuanxiang] walked out angrily without saying a word.
0:8:36|0:8:41|Stepping across the threshold, [Shi Chuanxiang] angrily glanced back and walked away, suppressing his rage.
0:8:41|0:8:50|Upon seeing this situation, Yingzi also felt heartbroken. [Shi Chuanxiang] swiftly lifted the sewage into a large bucket, took another look at the Liu family's courtyard, and then stormed off in anger.
0:10:6|0:10:13|Old Wang happily came to collect steamed buns with a basket, but unexpectedly the other party only gave him four, let's go.
0:11:26|0:11:32|Night falls, Shi Chuanxiang and Cui Xiuting are dining at the fishing village, the restaurant is bustling with many customers.
0:11:42|0:11:47|The tasty beer, delicious snacks, and fresh fish make the customers unable to resist licking their fingers.
0:11:47|0:11:51|Lawyer Fang leisurely sips on his juice, while Lingling enjoys her meal with great pleasure.
0:11:51|0:11:55|Watching [Lingling] eating heartily, [Lawyer Fang] put down his juice and couldn't help but say to her.
0:12:52|0:12:56|The next day, the two of them arrived at the nursing home and took good care of [Mrs. Shen].
0:14:22|0:14:25|[Lingling] saw the situation and immediately signaled to [Lawyer Fang].
0:14:25|0:14:28|Lawyer Fang immediately understood and quickly turned on the radio.
0:14:28|0:14:36|That winter, the People's Liberation Army surrounded Beijing and fired cold guns everywhere.
0:15:45|0:15:48|[Xiao Ying] stood at the door holding the child, looking a bit at a loss.
0:15:48|0:15:53|She glanced around for a moment in private, then walked into the alley holding the child. 
0:15:53|0:15:59|She covered her face with a scarf, holding the child in her arms, passing through layers of smoke, and walking past the local temple.
0:15:59|0:16:4|She carefully observed the surroundings at the intersection, made sure there was no one on the road, and then continued walking outward.
0:16:5|0:16:20|Walking through the winding alleys, Shi Chuanxiang arrived at a dilapidated outhouse. After cautiously looking around to make sure no one had noticed, he carefully placed the child on a large stone at the entrance of the outhouse, neatly wrapped and standing out from the dirty and messy surroundings.
0:16:21|0:16:26|He slowly stood up and looked at the child, stepping back as he prepared to leave.
0:16:26|0:16:29|Unexpectedly, as soon as he turned around, the child started crying.
0:16:29|0:16:35|He hurriedly jogged back to the child's side, crouched down, lightly patted his back, and gently comforted him.
0:16:35|0:16:39|The child couldn't be comforted, and kept crying non-stop.
0:16:39|0:16:46|At this moment, a sound of footsteps approached, and [Shi Chuanxiang] looked up alertly, quickly hiding behind the latrine.
0:16:46|0:16:55|[Shi Chuanxiang] pushed the dung cart over, stopping it at the entrance of the outhouse. He lifted the dung bucket, ready to start working, when he suddenly noticed the eagle on the stone.
0:16:56|0:17:11|He quickly put down the bucket of manure, carefully picked up the child, completely unaware that the eagle was peeking from behind the wall. The child, crying in [Shi Chuanxiang]'s arms, he gently comforted the child while looking around trying to find the child's family.
0:17:12|0:17:14|Ultimately, nothing was gained.
0:17:14|0:17:17|Yingzi, upon seeing this, quickly hid in the women's restroom.
0:17:17|0:17:25|[Shi Chuanxiang] looked at the pitiful child in his arms, the surroundings empty and deserted with no one in sight, so he left while holding the child.
0:17:25|0:17:30|Yingzi watched the back of [Shi Chuanxiang] as he walked away, silently memorizing his appearance.
0:17:30|0:17:32|Mrs. Shen recalled the past, tasting that breath of hers.
0:17:40|0:17:44|Lawyer Fang turned off the radio, and only then did Lingling react. She continued to ask.
0:17:45|0:17:54|Mrs. Shen looked at her with a serious expression and shook her head. Lingling looked disappointedly at Lawyer Fang behind her. After a moment of contemplation, Lawyer Fang leaned forward and asked.
0:18:10|0:18:13|[Shi Chuanxiang] wanted to carry the child and walk home.
0:18:28|0:18:36|Shi Chuanxiang's wife is cooking at home, their son is playing on the heated brick bed, and a pot of millet porridge is boiling on the stove.
0:18:36|0:18:43|Wife had just finished stirring the porridge in the pot when [Shi Chuanxiang] walked in carrying the child.
0:19:5|0:19:8|The wife unbuttoned her cotton-padded jacket and wrapped the child in her arms.
0:19:13|0:19:19|[Shi Chuanxiang] took out a small bowl, scooped a bowl of millet porridge from the pot, and brought it to his wife.
0:19:19|0:19:26|The child in Shi Chuanxiang's arms was hungry and kept whimpering. His wife dipped her finger into something, blew on it carefully, and fed it to the child.
0:19:26|0:19:31|Seeing the child eating with relish, the wife looked up and happily said to [Shi Chuanxiang].
0:20:32|0:20:39|Two months later, Beiping was liberated. The streets were bustling with noise, firecrackers were going off, and banners lined both sides of the streets.
0:20:39|0:20:48|People are dancing in the street to celebrate the good news. [Shi Chuanxiang] is walking on the street holding a child, watching the lively scene, feeling very happy as well.
0:20:48|0:20:52|In the street, the wealthy villagers are all smiles, waving the chess pieces in their hands.
0:20:53|0:21:0|A young person dressed in bright clothing, dancing a neat dance, with Chairman Mao's portrait on the street uplifting the spirits.
0:21:0|0:21:6|[Shi Chuanxiang] is overjoyed as he holds the child, his face beaming with a happy smile.
0:21:6|0:21:17|Before long, he walked through the bustling crowd to the military hall, where a group of innocent and lively children approached him under the guidance of [Cui Xiuting], followed by two male comrades.
0:21:17|0:21:19|Shi Chuanxiang, upon seeing the situation, quickly asked the male comrade.
0:21:36|0:21:50|[Shi Chuanxiang] held the child and looked into the room, pushed the door open and walked in, closing the door behind him. Inside, the female comrade was taking care of the child. Seeing this, she walked up with a smile and said.
0:21:50|0:21:59|The lady hesitated for a moment after seeing the hand extended by the female comrade, before gently reaching out to shake it.
0:23:57|0:23:59|Most of the students have unleashed their imagination.
0:24:0|0:24:13|Some students wrote about moving their homes to mid-air, while others wrote about moving their homes to the forest. One student had a more interesting idea, saying they wanted to move their home to Mars.
0:24:13|0:24:15|The students all laughed.
0:25:52|0:25:59|Later on, Mr. Chen, who went to the United States, came into some money and wanted to find an heir.
0:26:4|0:26:10|However, the little girl's birthday is around the same time as when you went to the welfare home.
0:26:14|0:26:18|[Shi Chuanxiang] took the photo and looked at it, then said to the lawyer.
0:27:1|0:27:9|Just, he passed away two years ago.
0:27:9|0:27:14|[Shi Chuanxiang] sighed, adjusted his emotions, and then began the class.
0:28:22|0:28:28|[Shi Chuanxiang] opens the bookshelf at home and takes out an old album from the bottom layer.
0:28:28|0:28:33|He slowly closed the cabinet door, sat on the comfortable sofa in the living room, and began to flip through the pages.
0:28:33|0:28:38|The photo album is filled with pictures from the liberation era, as well as memories of childhood.
0:28:39|0:28:47|In the photo, she is lively and lovely, with shoulder-length short hair, a neat shirt, and a particularly delicate look when reading seriously.
0:28:47|0:28:58|At this moment, a green-toned solo photo caught her attention. She picked up the album and examined it closely, revealing a smile as she reminisced about the happy days at the welfare home.
0:30:39|0:30:44|Auntie pulled Sister into the courtyard, followed closely by [Shi Chuanxiang] and his apprentice Xiao Wang.
0:30:44|0:30:49|At this moment, the girl with twin ponytails, Guiying, is lingering at the entrance of the courtyard.
0:30:49|0:30:56|Xiao Wang came out of the yard carrying a bucket of manure on his back. As soon as he looked up and saw Guiying, he quickly lowered his head and hid back into the yard.
0:30:56|0:31:4|[Shi Chuanxiang] happened to walk out of the courtyard and felt somewhat puzzled by Xiao Wang's self-deprecating appearance. When he saw Guiying, he had the answer in his heart.
0:32:20|0:32:27|[Shi Chuanxiang] took off his work clothes and saw Xiao Wang washing his hands on the side, looking gloomy. He bent down, smiled at him, and teased him.
0:34:4|0:34:10|The First Automobile Factory produced Liberation brand trucks, and in the future they will also produce various types of specialized vehicles for different industries.
0:34:44|0:34:47|[Shi Chuanxiang] rides his bicycle home with Liberation after work.
0:34:57|0:35:7|Shi Chuanxiang and Cui Xiuting happily walked towards home. Inside the house, the wife was putting dumplings into the steaming pot and stirring with a spoon. After a moment, she said to everyone.
0:35:54|0:36:0|[Shi Chuanxiang] puts on a raincoat and says to Xiao Liu.
0:36:42|0:36:48|The pouring rain kept falling, the raindrops hitting [Shi Chuanxiang]'s face, making it hard to keep his eyes open.
0:36:48|0:36:56|He was wearing a raincoat and carrying a bucket of manure and tools as he walked into the heavily flooded alley, followed by Xiao Wang and his colleagues.
0:37:19|0:37:30|The sky was filled with lightning, pouring rain, and even the small path was flooded. [Shi Chuanxiang] wanted to walk into the courtyard in the heavy rain, while Xiao Wang behind him looked disgusted.
0:38:9|0:38:15|The old lady's outhouse is on the verge of collapsing due to heavy rain, and [Shi Chuanxiang] decides to help her quickly rebuild it.
0:38:15|0:38:28|Xiao Wang, although reluctant, started to help out. However, he accidentally picked up a brick covered in filth, causing him to vomit violently.
0:38:28|0:38:31|[Shi Chuanxiang] laughed when he saw his disheveled appearance.
0:39:45|0:39:50|The old lady chased out with an umbrella and a bucket of water, but still couldn't catch up.
0:39:50|0:39:54|She stood at the entrance of the alley, watching the back of [Shi Chuanxiang] as he walked away, feeling grateful in her heart.
0:40:56|0:41:1|In the evening, the son took down the chest flower hanging on the wall by Shi Chuanxiang and looked at it carefully.
0:41:56|0:42:1|They went together to the Great Hall of the People to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country with the party and state leaders.
0:43:4|0:43:9|In the glorious history of our motherland, countless heroes have emerged.
0:43:9|0:43:14|The magnificent rivers and mountains of our motherland have left behind countless sacred traces of heroes.
0:43:14|0:43:18|But the greatest hero is born today.
0:43:18|0:43:31|For a greater victory, on October 26th, more than 6,000 heroes, holding high the red flag of the general line, gathered at the Great Hall of the People in the capital, carrying the achievements of the Great Leap Forward.
0:43:44|0:43:52|[Shi Chuanxiang] returned to the alley after attending the gathering of heroes, where his coworkers welcomed him warmly with drums and gongs, and even displayed a photo of him with Chairman Liu Shaoqi.
0:44:17|0:44:21|The workers were excited and pulled [Shi Chuanxiang] onto the stage, asking him to make a speech.
0:44:21|0:44:25|He stood on the stage, smiling happily as he spoke to everyone.
0:45:42|0:45:44|I said at that time.
0:46:4|0:46:6|Chairman Liu said to me.
0:46:23|0:46:24|Chairman Liu continued.
0:46:34|0:46:38|The crowd was delighted after listening, and they all rushed forward to shake hands with [Shi Chuanxiang].
0:46:38|0:46:44|Returning home in the evening, his wife looked at the photo of [Shi Chuanxiang] with Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and couldn't stop smiling.
0:48:0|0:48:15|Yes, Chairman Liu said that an advanced worker, a Communist Party member, not only needs to excel in work, but also in all aspects. The children took the pens and looked carefully.
0:48:53|0:48:56|In the end, it was Shi Chuanxiang who got the pen.
0:48:56|0:49:3|In the evening, after finishing work, he gently closed the pen cap and looked at the pen in his hand with a satisfied smile.
0:49:3|0:49:8|He turned to look at the calligraphy on the wall, which read "educating and nurturing students".
0:49:8|0:49:13|This plunged him back into memories, leading [Shi Chuanxiang] into the room.
0:50:3|0:50:9|Under everyone's gaze, Liberation was writing diligently according to [Shi Chuanxiang]'s instructions.
0:50:26|0:50:44|All the comrades were deeply moved by this, unanimously expressing their firm determination to listen to the Party and to you, to continue to work hard, do their jobs better, and actively study and write.
0:50:51|0:51:2|To become a cultured worker and contribute more to socialist construction.
0:51:3|0:51:12|In 2001, Beijing already had a specialized garbage processing plant, with various types of garbage trucks neatly arranged inside.
0:51:12|0:51:20|Lawyer Fang drove a car through a spacious square into the processing plant, where [Shi Chuanxiang]'s son Shi Chunting was working.
0:53:18|0:53:24|A bouquet of flowers was placed in front of the statue of [Shi Chuanxiang], his diligent and simple image is admirable.
0:53:24|0:53:30|Lawyer Fang and Lingling were completely focused on the statue, paying no attention to Teacher Jiefang behind them.
0:53:30|0:53:34|Jiefang looked at the backs of the two people, filled with doubt.
0:53:34|0:53:38|After a moment, Lawyer Fang and Lingling were ready to leave, and Shi Chuanxiang took the initiative to approach.
0:54:37|0:54:47|When I remember coming back from work sometimes, Shi Chuanxiang and Cui Xiuting would smile knowingly, but their liberated expressions would turn serious.
0:55:9|0:55:20|The two fell into silence after listening.
0:55:20|0:55:27|During the Cultural Revolution, the streets and alleys were filled with big-character posters, creating a tense atmosphere.
0:55:27|0:55:30|[Shi Chuanxiang] was extremely worried, so he decided to go home to visit [Cui Xiuting].
0:55:30|0:55:38|At night, he walked home alone, his heart pounding, clutching his pants tightly, constantly alert to the sounds around him. 
0:56:17|0:56:22|[Shi Chuanxiang] picked up the broken photo frame from the pile of debris on the ground.
0:56:22|0:56:25|He looked at the photo in his hand, and after a moment of contemplation, he suddenly felt something was wrong.
0:59:7|0:59:10|Shi Chuanxiang listened and then smiled with satisfaction.
0:59:10|0:59:16|He tremblingly took out the pen that Chairman Liu Shaoqi gave him from under the pillow.
0:59:16|0:59:19|He held it in his hand and examined it carefully, letting out a soft sigh.
0:59:53|0:59:57|[Shi Chuanxiang] eyes filled with tears, took the pen from [Cui Xiuting]'s hands with both hands.
1:0:23|1:0:26|Shi Chuanxiang sat in a chair, panting heavily, and spoke to everyone.
1:1:48|1:2:2|Especially, outside the city gate, the residents of the small houses in the alleys have strong opinions.
1:3:35|1:3:40|The next morning, the wife helped Shi Chuanxiang down the stairs with a cane.
1:3:40|1:3:43|The neighbors around came out of their houses one after another to watch.
1:3:43|1:3:47|Turning the corner out of the alley, Shi Chuanxiang and Cui Xiuting saw Xiao Wang and the children.
1:3:47|1:3:53|Both sons, dressed in dung-cleaning work clothes and holding tools, walked towards him in unison. 
1:4:7|1:4:16|Shi Chuanxiang patted Xiao Wang on the shoulder, then looked at his two sons in work clothes, finally feeling relieved.
1:4:16|1:4:23|He adjusted his military coat and, supported by Xiao Wang and his wife, walked towards the tricycle loaded with luggage.
1:4:23|1:4:29|With the help of everyone, he sat in the back seat of the tricycle, while his wife attentively helped him tidy up his clothes.
1:5:44|1:5:53|Shi Chuanxiang nodded in agreement after listening.
1:5:53|1:5:56|The couple sat on a tricycle, bidding farewell to everyone reluctantly.
1:5:58|1:6:4|With a command from the master, [Shi Chuanxiang] and [Cui Xiuting] became a couple, waving goodbye to everyone with a heavy heart.
1:6:4|1:6:10|The children watched the two figures walk away, feeling not only reluctant to part but also at a loss.
1:6:10|1:6:14|Seeing the two of them walk away, Xiao Wang led the other three to get ready for work.
1:6:25|1:6:32|[Shi Chuanxiang] answered Lingling's question with a smile, then recalled the days of helping Ishikawa Xiang pick manure.
1:8:28|1:8:36|Everyone took out drinks and tea from their homes for them to drink, and the unspoken gratitude was also gathered in the water.
1:8:36|1:8:42|[Shi Chuanxiang] and his wife left Beijing and continued their journey to their hometown by bus.
1:9:30|1:9:34|In his youth, [Shi Chuanxiang] and his friends set out on the road to Beiping.
1:9:34|1:9:38|During the day, they traveled on the road, rested at night, and drank water from the river when they were thirsty.
1:9:38|1:9:42|In the evening, they sat around the campfire, eating dry rations together.
1:9:42|1:9:46|Shi Chuanxiang opens the bundle, inside there is only one last steamed bun.
1:9:46|1:9:52|Seeing all his friends enjoying their meal, [Shi Chuanxiang] stood up alone and moved to a distant spot.
1:9:52|1:9:55|Unexpectedly, as soon as he sat down, he heard the sound of a boy crying.
1:10:9|1:10:16|By the bonfire, the boy noticed something unusual about Shi Chuanxiang. He stood up and walked over to Shi Chuanxiang, saying.
1:11:23|1:11:35|Shi Chuanxiang embarked on the road to Beiping alone as his friends refused to continue. Walking on the railway track, with cracked lips and weary steps, he displayed signs of exhaustion.
1:11:37|1:11:40|But his eyes were full of anticipation for Beiping.
1:11:40|1:11:50|Shi Chuanxiang arrived in Beiping on a snowy day. He fainted at the entrance of an alley after arriving by land from the airport, and was coincidentally seen by a scavenger who was working early.
1:11:50|1:11:59|Lao Wang carefully turned over his curled body, felt his breath with his hand, helped him up, and peeled off the accumulated blood from his body.
1:13:2|1:13:6|In the room, the master and two aunts are happily having a meal.
1:13:6|1:13:10|Shi Chuanxiang is lying by the window, observing the situation inside.
1:15:29|1:15:32|Shi Chuanxiang's request for leave was not approved.
1:15:32|1:15:36|In the evening, he and Lao Wang were preparing the grass for feeding the donkeys.
1:15:36|1:15:40|Lao Wang put the grass into the stone trough, everything was arranged properly.
1:15:40|1:15:44|Looking at the gloomy Shi Chuanxiang, Cui Xiuting already had the answer in her heart.
1:15:44|1:15:50|He sat down slowly on the kang, while Shi Chuanxiang beside him hung his head in silence.
1:15:50|1:15:54|Lao Wang, however, remained calm and handed his own cigarette to Shi [Chuanxiang].
1:16:1|1:16:6|Lao Wang's words undoubtedly hit Shi [Chuanxiang] hard.
1:16:40|1:16:42|At this moment, Shi [Chuanxiang] still had no idea.
1:16:42|1:16:45|His bride has already been brought into the family by his mother.
1:16:45|1:16:50|[Cui Xiuting] took off the headpiece and placed it in a box, holding the lid and looking around the so-called new house.
1:16:50|1:17:0|The rooster on the ground was struggling hard, looking somewhat bewildered at the simple new house. He had to sit on the kang, and as soon as he sat down, he heard his mother's voice.
1:17:9|1:17:29|He quickly blew out the kerosene lamp on the table. The next morning, [Cui Xiuting] was awakened by the crowing of a rooster. He quickly lifted the blanket and sat up, looking at the empty room, feeling a bit lost. Then he picked up the quilt cover used for the wedding on the kang yesterday, looked back and forth, feeling very uneasy.
1:17:56|1:18:0|[Cui Xiuting] immediately realized and started to take off the coat on her body.
1:18:0|1:18:4|She took off her gown and revealed a patched cotton padded jacket underneath.
1:18:4|1:18:7|Seeing her sister-in-law looking at her, [Shi Chuanxiang] smiled and said.
1:18:28|1:18:35|Watching the neighbor auntie take away the rooster, [Cui Xiuting] couldn't hold back anymore and started crying sadly.
1:19:32|1:19:38|Following that, [Shi Chuanxiang] recounted the story from that year.
1:19:56|1:20:1|Shi Chuanxiang, who had finally caught the bus, picked up his package and hurried home.
1:20:1|1:20:5|Alone, [Shi Chuanxiang] once again set foot on the familiar road home.
1:20:5|1:20:9|[Shi Chuanxiang] arrived home that day, while [Cui Xiuting] was cooking over a fire in the yard.
1:20:57|1:21:11|[Cui Xiuting] happily returned to the room, blushing as she closed the door, opened the dressing table, took out a mirror, carefully tidied her hair and clothes, preparing to meet [Shi Chuanxiang]. Voices could be heard outside the door.
1:21:29|1:21:34|[Cui Xiuting] heard a noise and immediately covered her head with a blanket.
1:21:34|1:21:38|[Shi Chuanxiang] pushed open the door and saw [Cui Xiuting] sitting on the heated brick bed.
1:21:38|1:21:41|She walked towards [Cui Xiuting] with a smile on her face.
1:21:41|1:21:46|She happened to see the mandarin ducks that [Cui Xiuting] hadn't finished embroidering on the hat, and she praised with a smile.
1:21:55|1:22:4|[Shi Chuanxiang] gently lifts the blanket, looks down at the shy [Cui Xiuting], and can't help but praise her with a smile.
1:22:8|1:22:11|[Cui Xiuting] was extremely shy and quickly put down the veil.
1:22:11|1:22:20|[Shi Chuanxiang] embraced [Cui Xiuting], who looked so beautiful and elegant as the bride, with a happy smile on his face.
1:22:25|1:22:52|As long as we keep moving forward, there is no impassable Flame Mountain road. The road will definitely get wider as we go, not afraid of the difficult path, let's walk together and not separate.

1:22:52|1:23:3|Finally, in August 1973, after Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai learned of the matter, they instructed the relevant departments to bring him back to Beijing, politically rehabilitate him, and restore his reputation.
1:23:3|1:23:7|Comrade Shi Chuanxiang passed away on May 19, 1975, at the age of 60.

1:23:14|1:23:20|Shi Chuanxiang drives with Mrs. Shen in the car, heading down the road in the present time.
1:23:20|1:23:29|Mrs. Shen couldn't help but ask when she saw the situation.
1:23:29|1:23:35|Lawyer Fang's answer surprised Mrs. Shen greatly, and she couldn't help but look out at the bustling and lively city outside the window.
1:23:36|1:23:47|Looking at the tall buildings outside the window, Mrs. Shen hesitated to speak.
1:25:23|1:25:27|Lawyer Fang took out a camera, preparing to take a photo for Mrs. Shen.
1:25:27|1:25:31|[Lingling] happened to spot him.
1:25:31|1:25:33|[Shi Chuanxiang] walks towards Lawyer Fang, holding a bouquet of flowers.
1:25:44|1:25:48|[Shi Chuanxiang] holds flowers and takes the initiative to greet Mrs. Shen.
1:26:21|1:26:31|[Shi Chuanxiang] placed the flowers by the fountain, looking at the place where he was abandoned as a child now transformed into tall buildings, feeling a mix of emotions in his heart.
1:26:31|1:26:41|The city's development is changing rapidly, with the brilliant Five-Star Red Flag fluttering in the wind. The spirit of [Cui Xiuting] has never been extinguished in the continuous inheritance of decades.
