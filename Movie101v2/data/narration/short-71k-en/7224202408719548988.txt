0:0:37|0:0:49|In the faint morning light, a backlit figure shouts loudly towards the layered village tents.
0:0:49|0:0:53|The ancient village is built against the mountains, with the sound of men echoing in the valley.
0:1:2|0:1:9|In the dilapidated village house, a little girl is carrying a porcelain bowl, walking towards her grandmother in the yard.
0:1:31|0:1:35|Watching the girl run away, [Grandmother] showed a hint of worry on her face.
0:1:35|0:1:47|The breeze on the hill blew gently, [Yaya] looked quietly into the distance, only to see a group of children chasing and playing with each other. She watched their figures, full of envy in her eyes.
0:1:47|0:1:53|But when he looked back, the children had already walked far away, leaving only the little girl standing alone.
0:1:53|0:2:3|At this moment, inside a school in the county town, two women are chatting and discussing their future plans.
0:2:4|0:2:8|The woman closed the book and smiled as she gazed into the distance.
0:2:38|0:2:50|Facing the concerns and doubts of her close friend, the woman just smiled, because she had already made up her mind. She turned her gaze to the book in her hand, with a hint of doubt in her eyes, as if pondering something.
0:2:50|0:2:59|After a moment, she put down the box of civil service exam books in her hand, looked into the distance with a longing smile, because she had decided to go to the deep mountains to dedicate herself.
0:2:59|0:3:6|The scene returns to the vast countryside, where the sunlit hillsides reveal a natural desolation and remoteness.
0:3:6|0:3:19|The flock of sheep is quietly grazing on the grassland in the distance, an old man parks his bicycle under a tree by the road, hands in pockets looking towards the distant road, his aged brows slightly furrowed, as if waiting for someone.
0:3:19|0:3:26|And just now, the woman who was devoted to the teachings had already gotten on the car, swaying back and forth as she recalled her college graduation ceremony.
0:4:33|0:4:39|The principal standing next to him at the time, delivering an impassioned speech to the students in the auditorium.
0:4:39|0:4:47|He has high hopes for everyone's future, while the people in the audience look thoughtful, as if contemplating their own future paths.
0:4:49|0:4:57|The ambitious woman, inspired by the principal's speech, showed a hint of determination in her eyes and made a new resolution for her future.
0:5:56|0:6:1|He chased the goose in front of him, held the goose in his arms, looking silly.
0:6:1|0:6:3|At this moment, [Yaya] ran into the children on the road.
0:6:14|0:6:16|The fool, upon seeing the situation, hurried over.
0:6:22|0:6:33|He drove away the naughty children while holding a big goose, then turned around and looked at [Yaya] with a somewhat silly expression.
0:6:33|0:6:36|[The Fool] smiled at her, then stumbled away while holding the goose.
0:6:38|0:6:45|The old man by the roadside was still gazing into the distance when a bus finally swayed its way into the village.
0:6:45|0:6:54|The roar of the car grew louder and louder, and in his eager gaze, the muddy car finally slowed down and came to a stop beside the old man.
0:6:54|0:7:0|A woman stood up and appeared at the door with a dusty suitcase in hand.
0:7:0|0:7:4|The old man, seeing the situation, quickly ran forward a few steps and took the suitcase from his hands.
0:7:17|0:7:23|It's okay, [the Village Chief] loads the luggage onto the bicycle and ties it up.
0:7:55|0:8:1|Walking one behind the other along the shaded path, [Fang Yan] casually glances sideways.
0:8:1|0:8:9|Xiaoya stood among the trees, glanced at him from a distance, locked eyes for a moment, then turned around and ran off happily.
0:8:26|0:8:32|The village chief enthusiastically carried the luggage and led [Fang Yan] to the cave dwelling filled with hellish features.
0:8:32|0:8:42|The two walked into the room, the village chief helped put the luggage by the bed, while [Fang Yan] turned around and smiled, placing personal items at the foot of the bed.
0:9:5|0:9:11|[Fangyan] smiled and bid farewell to the village chief, carefully lighting up the small house that would accompany her for the next three months.
0:9:11|0:9:14|Her teaching life is about to begin.
0:9:14|0:9:20|In the village courtyard, children are playing in small groups, their laughter filling the air.
0:9:20|0:9:25|At this moment, [Fangyan] and the village chief walked shoulder to shoulder, entering the courtyard along the steps.
0:10:3|0:10:17|[Fang Yan] smiled and nodded, then the principal walked out of the classroom with his hands behind his back.
0:10:17|0:10:22|Fang Yanzhe cleaned the blackboard and turned around to smile at the students, starting her lecture.
0:10:55|0:11:1|The sound of flipping books in the classroom was continuous, but [Yaya] was still far away on the hillside, looking at everything in the classroom.
0:11:3|0:11:15|After class, the children grouped together and played in the ditches and rivers, running from one hill to another, chasing and playing, showing a carefree atmosphere.
0:11:15|0:11:24|[Yaya] looked at the children running under the vast sky with a lonely expression, a hint of melancholy showing on her slightly raised face, leaving only a thin figure in the end.
0:11:26|0:11:32|In the dim light, in front of the teacher's clock, [Fang Yan] is diligently handwriting the lesson plan.
0:11:32|0:11:39|In the densely packed handwriting lies her full enthusiasm and dreams, with half of the pen already used up beside her.
0:11:39|0:11:43|Even in the late night, she is still earnestly preparing for teaching.
0:11:43|0:11:48|She flipped through the textbook while occasionally looking up, as if pondering something.
0:11:48|0:11:53|She pressed her hand against her head and looked into the distance, lost in memories of before she came here.
0:11:56|0:12:2|It was a sunny afternoon, and [Fang Yan] had just walked out of a building on the university campus.
0:12:2|0:12:12|A car slowly pulled up to the door, the driver's seat opened, a man got out and stood still in front of [Fang Yan], facing her directly.
0:13:23|0:13:32|[Fang Yan] stubbornly shifted her gaze elsewhere, only to find her boyfriend's gaze and then repeatedly dodge it, leaving the two in a stalemate.
0:13:32|0:13:39|The rustling of leaves, the boyfriend paced back and forth with a troubled heart, his footsteps sounding like the impatient beats of a classical piece, facing away from [Fang Yan].
0:13:39|0:13:45|After pondering for a long time, the boyfriend finally turned around slowly and looked into [Fang Yan]'s eyes.
0:14:11|0:14:20|In the courtyard, the elementary school students, with bright red scarves, solemnly gaze at the national flag in front of them, their young hands raised to their ears.
0:14:20|0:14:36|Xiaoya, although not with the children, stood on the hillside, raised her hand as the flag was being raised. Lao Xiu's sound system was on a shaky stool, playing the national anthem quietly. Fang Yan looked at the children saluting, a sense of belonging emerging.
0:14:36|0:14:49|In the courtyard, under the gaze of everyone, the two little flag bearers finally raised the national flag to the top. The children stood up straight, looking up at the top of the flag. Xiao Ya stood upright on the distant hillside.
0:14:49|0:14:56|Her small hand was raised resolutely above her head, her eyes looking determinedly into the distance, with a glint of respect and hope shining in them.
0:14:56|0:15:2|The national flag flutters in the wind, witnessing every little moment of the children.
0:15:2|0:15:5|In the classroom, [Fang Yan] begins a new day of teaching.
0:15:23|0:15:33|At this moment, on the small road in the village, [Xiao Yanu] is running hurriedly in tattered clothes.
0:15:33|0:15:36|Her steps quickened, as if in a hurry to get to somewhere.
0:16:10|0:16:19|During Fang Yan's class, which was halfway through, she suddenly saw the little girl who had glanced at her from a distance before, leaning against the window, secretly listening to her lecture.
0:16:19|0:16:24|Her lecture paused for a moment, and [Xiao Ya] noticed and fled like a bird.
0:16:33|0:16:47|Late at night, [Xiao Ya Nu] lying on the bed is still reminiscing about the various experiences of the day. The new young female teacher, holding a bamboo pole, with a clear smile on her face, explained ancient poetry to the students word by word, showcasing the charm of traditional culture.
0:16:48|0:16:52|The girl looked up at the ceiling, her eyes filled with anticipation and emotion.
0:16:52|0:17:1|In her impression, the figure was so clean and moving that she couldn't fall asleep even in the middle of the night, still constantly recalling scenes in the classroom.
0:17:1|0:17:7|The next day, among the layers of mountains, outside the classroom of the village school, [Xiao Ya] was once again leaning against the window listening to the lesson.
0:18:14|0:18:21|After finishing today's assignments, [Fang Yan] put down her work and quietly turned around, walking towards the door.
0:18:21|0:18:25|Several students looked at the back of the teacher in confusion, not saying a word.
0:18:25|0:18:30|At this moment, [Fang Yan] had already reached the door and found the little girl still diligently practicing.
0:18:32|0:18:40|He was about to step forward and ask a question, but unexpectedly, the girl, as if frightened by something, hastily ran away.
0:18:40|0:18:45|[Only Fang Yan], looking puzzled, walked up to the window where the girl had just been leaning.
0:18:45|0:18:50|Unexpectedly, what was left on the windowsill was the young girl's earnest and diligent practice notes.
0:18:53|0:18:56|The girl's sincere and noble desire for learning touched [Fang Yan].
0:18:56|0:19:0|In silence, [Fang Yan] walked back to the platform with her head down.
0:19:0|0:19:8|Unexpectedly, her classmates had already noticed her unusual behavior.
0:19:8|0:19:12|Upon hearing the explanation from the little girl in the class, [Fang Yan] was stunned, almost forgetting that she was still standing there.
0:19:17|0:19:26|After belatedly letting the girl sit down, [Fang Yan] stood still in the same spot, at a loss for words for a moment, just quietly staring out the window at the national flag.
0:19:26|0:19:39|Late at night, [Yaya] was still curled up in her blanket, but the scene of the new teacher giving a lecture kept flashing back in her mind frame by frame. The image of the teacher educating and teaching on the podium had been deeply engraved in [Yaya]'s heart.
0:19:40|0:19:45|On the other side, Teacher Fang Yan was still sitting at the desk, reminiscing about every move of [Ya Ya].
0:19:45|0:19:50|The girl she had met before unexpectedly had such a difficult past.
0:19:50|0:19:58|Other children were sitting in the room, but [Yaya] could only lie on the windowsill quietly listening to the lesson, even afraid of being discovered by him and dared not move.
0:19:58|0:20:3|And as she approached, [Yaya] fled as if startled.
0:20:7|0:20:9|Thinking of this scene, [Fang Yan] once again fell into contemplation.
0:20:18|0:20:21|With the familiar shout, it's a new day in the village.
0:20:21|0:20:27|The scene unfolds with layers of banners and flags fluttering in the wind, as two young boys face each other and start playing a game of cockfighting.
0:20:27|0:20:33|A few children are skipping rope happily in the background. Suddenly, Fang Yan sees a little boy fall down.
0:20:46|0:20:49|In the middle of the class, Fang Yan saw [Yaya] outside the window, admiring the bright moon.
0:21:30|0:21:45|When they grew up, they went their separate ways. Teacher Fang continued teaching while quietly walking out the door, approaching [Ya Ya] on the side. He saw [Ya Ya] holding an old-fashioned brick, smearing her handwriting on the windowsill.
0:21:45|0:21:48|[Yaya] looked up and met the concerned gaze of Teacher Fang.
0:21:48|0:21:52|In the next second, [Yaya] ran away as fast as before.
0:21:56|0:22:0|But this time, Fang Yan decided to catch up and see what was going on.
0:22:0|0:22:7|She wanted to know what kind of family background and past the girl had, and why she could only eavesdrop on classes outside the window but dared not come in.
0:22:7|0:22:15|[Yaya] ran wildly along the country road, occasionally looking back to see where the teacher was.
0:22:15|0:22:21|Fang Yan closely followed [Yaya] as they ran along, trying several times to call out to her but never managing to catch up, almost losing her in the process.
0:22:22|0:22:30|[Yaya] ran up the steps, the surroundings becoming more desolate as she ran. Meanwhile, [Fang Yan], despite wearing high heels, kept closely following her footsteps.
0:22:30|0:22:35|The road was rough and difficult, Fang Yan climbed with some difficulty, but she still followed persistently.
0:22:35|0:22:42|She didn't even care that she might fall in her high heels, all she wanted was to keep up with [Yaya].
0:22:42|0:22:50|And [Yaya] was also hurrying along, running quickly. As she passed through a flat area, she even saw the fool chasing geese running towards her direction.
0:22:51|0:23:0|Crow stopped for a moment, as if wanting to signal to him, but worried that the teacher would catch up, so she glanced and ran off.
0:23:0|0:23:5|The idiot's face broke into a thick smile, as if he couldn't understand what [Yaya] was doing.
0:23:5|0:23:7|He watched [Yaya] run away, then went back to hug the goose.
0:23:7|0:23:14|The fool bent over and ran, the goose flapped its wings in front of him, and unexpectedly bumped into [Fang Yan].
0:23:14|0:23:18|Fang Yan's footsteps paused for a moment, looking at him with confusion.
0:23:18|0:23:21|He stared at the fool for a while, only to find the fool smiling.
0:23:32|0:23:37|Fang Yan decided to ignore the fool and ran forward along the path that [Ya Ya] had just walked.
0:23:37|0:23:43|The sky was getting dark, and she finally saw [Yaya] turning into a house with a couplet pasted on the door.
0:23:43|0:23:46|[Yaya] glanced back and disappeared through the door.
0:23:46|0:23:51|Fang Yan, panting heavily, caught up from behind and pushed open the ancient door.
0:23:51|0:23:56|In the courtyard, [Ya Ya]'s grandmother is washing clothes, looking busy.
0:23:56|0:24:1|Fang Yan quickly walked into the courtyard and saw that there were finally elders who could understand the situation, so she hurriedly went up to strike up a conversation.
0:25:7|0:25:12|For three years, Bai Jugu performed in plays, and her family always felt that [Yaya] was a bit special.
0:25:12|0:25:16|One night, they discussed the issue again with concern.
0:25:46|0:25:51|Grandma listened to her son's suggestion, thought for a moment, and nodded solemnly to indicate her agreement.
0:25:51|0:26:0|Early the next morning, [Father] packed up his bicycle and decided to make the long journey to the county to get his throat checked and see what the situation was.
0:26:0|0:26:4|The distant mountains loom over the head of this family like an inevitable fate.
0:26:5|0:26:11|Silently watching the backs of the women as they walk away amidst the silent gaze and the howling wind.
0:26:11|0:26:17|The father's expression on his face was unpredictable in the light and shadow, suffering from the fate that had befallen his own child.
0:26:17|0:26:23|He rode his bike home with [Yaya], always keeping his head down as if unsure of where to go.
0:26:23|0:26:26|However, this is the change that their family must face.
0:26:26|0:26:37|After a busy day, [Yaya] had already fallen asleep at home. Several adults looked at each other in silence when they learned the outcome, the silence hanging heavily over the house like a mountain that had been there for thousands of years.
0:26:37|0:26:41|The parents sighed while anxiously pinching their noses, thinking of a solution.
0:26:41|0:26:45|But the issue of [Yaya] not being able to speak is something that must be faced eventually.
0:27:37|0:27:46|After listening to the old lady's instructions, the father and son looked at each other in silence for a moment, then nodded, because this was their only choice to help poor [Yaya].
0:27:46|0:27:49|Early the next morning, Grandma took [Yaya] to see her off.
0:28:14|0:28:17|The mother, holding a water kettle, hesitated and looked back repeatedly, but could only move forward.
0:28:28|0:28:38|The old lady led the young [Yaya] by the hand, slowly making their way towards their long-time home, gradually disappearing at the end of the tree-lined path, leaving behind only two struggling shadows.
0:28:38|0:28:52|From now on, in this remote village, only [Yaya] and her grandmother depend on each other. Even though they do not know when this kind of life will bring new hope, it turns out to be like this.
0:29:40|0:29:43|While speaking, [Yaya] turned and ran out again.
0:29:47|0:29:55|Teacher Fang Yan followed [Yaya] all the way out and found her gazing up at the sky under a solitary tree in the plain.
0:29:55|0:30:1|She was like that tree, silently gazing towards the end of the sky, facing the eternal erosion in silence.
0:30:1|0:30:6|But now, the teacher has become [Yaya]'s brand new support, and [Yaya] is no longer alone.
0:30:31|0:30:35|After class, Fang Yan personally came to visit [Ya Ya] at her home, walking up to her with her own hands and feet, calling out her name.
0:31:15|0:31:22|[Yaya] borrowed the books and stationery from the teacher, smiling as she handed them to her grandmother to help keep them safe.
0:31:40|0:31:43|Golden fields.
0:32:5|0:32:8|After class, the students left in droves like a tide.
0:32:8|0:32:12|Only [Yaya] remained seated in her original spot, looking at her workbook.
0:32:33|0:32:45|In order to help [Yaya] understand the trick of pronunciation, Fang Yan took a pen and drew a lowercase letter "a" on the paper to teach.
0:32:45|0:32:48|Crow crowed silently, mimicking the mouth movements with great effort.
0:33:23|0:33:30|After class, Fang Yan took [Yaya] to the hillside with joy.
0:33:58|0:34:4|Two people are chasing and playing with a flock of sheep in the mountains, and their relationship is gradually getting better.
0:34:4|0:34:16|Meanwhile in the city, [Fang Yan]'s boyfriend is diligently working in the office.
0:34:16|0:34:20|The secretary walked out, and the boyfriend opened the letter, carefully reading it.
0:34:20|0:34:24|At the same time, Fang Yan and [Yaya] were still on the hillside, teaching hand in hand.
0:34:40|0:34:43|At the foot of the mountain, [Fang Yan] pointed to the sky and shouted loudly.
0:35:9|0:35:11|Duck Duck watched as he struggled to shape his mouth.
0:35:23|0:35:28|Soon, the secretary opened the door and walked into the room, approaching the desk and giving a slight bow.
0:35:29|0:35:34|Fang Yan's boyfriend lifted his head and handed the letter in his hand to the female secretary, asking her to help mail it out.
0:35:57|0:36:18|Fang Yan picked up a pen and wrote on the paper word by word, hoping to better help [Yaya] understand what it feels like to speak.
0:36:18|0:36:23|Fang Yan held [Yaya]'s tender little hand, helping her explore the possibility of making sounds in a silent world.
0:36:31|0:36:46|Fang Yan suddenly stopped, this was the first syllable she had heard [Ya Ya] speak out loud after teaching her for so many days, the syllable sounded like the sound of Pangu opening the sky and creating the world, freeing [Ya Ya] from a closed and silent world.
0:36:46|0:36:55|Fang Yan's face lit up with an uncontrollable smile and joy. She continued to hold Ya Ya's hand towards her throat, hoping to give Ya Ya more things.
0:36:56|0:37:0|This is a surprising start for both [Yaya] and Fang Yan.
0:37:0|0:37:5|Because this means that [Yaya] is fully capable of vocalizing like a normal person.
0:37:5|0:37:7|Since then, they have been practicing all the time.
0:38:10|0:38:13|Facing the difficult-to-pronounce syllables, [Fang Yan] patiently continues to tap.
0:38:52|0:38:54|Fang Ye picked up the textbook and muttered.
0:39:11|0:39:19|Fang Yan and [Yaya] are teaching in nature, learning the most precious knowledge in the most pristine world, where each day signifies new progress.
0:39:19|0:39:24|They learned from the hills to the valleys, from sunrise to sunset, and Fang Yan built a new world for him.
0:40:24|0:40:36|After such intense teaching, [Fang Yan] still diligently prepares to teach love in the evening. She pours all her enthusiasm into the children, even neglecting her own physical health as a result.
0:40:36|0:40:47|The next morning, [Fang Yan] got up and dressed as usual, but suddenly felt uncomfortable in her body, especially with an unusually dry throat, making it difficult to suppress the urge to cough constantly.
0:40:49|0:40:58|He casually draped his clothes with one hand while tidying up the teaching materials on the table. The discomfort in his throat, however, unexpectedly worsened, making it impossible for him to control.
0:41:7|0:41:10|Nevertheless, [Fang Yan] still decided to prioritize teaching.
0:41:10|0:41:13|She walked to the table and organized the lesson plans she had written last night.
0:41:13|0:41:17|She slightly bent her body, still feeling uncomfortable.
0:41:17|0:41:24|She [Ma Dongmei] forced herself to hold onto the book and walked out of the cave, once again stepping onto the platform to review the lessons from yesterday.
0:41:53|0:42:2|The children walked up to the platform one by one, lined up, and carefully calculated math problems on the blackboard, leaving behind their childish handwriting.
0:42:5|0:42:14|After finishing writing, [Fang Yan] sensibly put the chalk back into the box, walked down the platform and returned to her seat, watching the children's performance process with satisfaction.
0:42:16|0:42:21|But then she discovered a classmate's answer in the corner, which was completely different from everyone else's.
0:42:36|0:42:39|Erhu nodded heavily after receiving the reprimand.
0:42:53|0:42:56|Late at night, [Fang Yan]'s cough just wouldn't stop.
0:42:56|0:43:0|She stood up holding onto the table, wanting to go drink some hot water and take some medicine.
0:43:0|0:43:3|This way, she can continue telling the story tomorrow without being speechless.
0:43:7|0:43:11|[Fang Yan] poured herself half a cup of hot water for her sore throat, and walked slowly.
0:43:12|0:43:19|As he was about to drink water, the pain intensified once again. He held the cup, his face showing a look of agony.
0:43:19|0:43:24|He tried hard to suppress the discomfort in his throat, furrowing his brows tightly as he threw a handful of medicine into his mouth.
0:43:24|0:43:29|The next day, to everyone's surprise, there was no improvement at all. He stood on the platform, but continued to cough incessantly.
0:44:41|0:44:50|The children watched as [Yaya] walked over, taking advantage of their numbers to corner [Yaya] against the wall. A group of people surrounded her, staring intently, the atmosphere tense and on the verge of erupting.
0:45:14|0:45:22|[Yaya] heard the scolding from everyone, her face showing a mix of shame and indignation. She covered her face, cried, and ran away, while the children just watched from afar.
0:45:22|0:45:28|When Fang Yan arrived for class, she looked around the classroom and immediately noticed that [Yaya] was missing.
0:45:28|0:45:33|She showed a puzzled expression on stage, paused for a moment, wanting to ask everyone what was going on.
0:45:49|0:45:55|Fang Yan, angrily, slammed the table and ran out without hesitation in the children's gaze.
0:45:55|0:45:59|He knew he had to chase [Yaya] back, otherwise he didn't know what [Yaya] would do.
0:45:59|0:46:4|At this moment, [Yaya] is running frantically on a small path, wiping tears with dirty hands as she runs.
0:46:7|0:46:14|Fang Yan fell down because she was running too fast, but she didn't even think about stopping. She got up and continued running forward.
0:46:26|0:46:33|[Yaya] ran up the mountain road, getting farther and farther away, while Fang Yan struggled to follow her from behind, afraid of losing sight of her.
0:46:48|0:46:51|[Yaya] ran for a while and finally stopped.
0:46:51|0:46:55|At this moment, she stood once again under the lonely tree on the plain.
0:46:55|0:47:1|In [Fang Yan]'s eyes, her young figure at this moment appeared as lonely as the tree, standing desolately on the plain.
0:47:1|0:47:6|[Fang Yan] stepped forward, standing behind her, wanting to comfort and support her.
0:47:6|0:47:10|The two of them stood under the tree, the wind blowing at the temples of [Fang Yan].
0:47:10|0:47:12|She squatted down and looked into Yaya's eyes.
0:48:1|0:48:6|[Fang Yan] looked at the children's eyes with relief, while Yaya also looked up at her with clear eyes.
0:48:16|0:48:22|On this day, [Teacher Fang] was suppressing the discomfort in her throat while earnestly preparing to present the case.
0:48:22|0:48:28|Unexpectedly, [the old village chief] pushed the door open unsteadily at this moment to visit him.
0:48:58|0:49:9|[Fang Yan] smiled as she bid farewell to the village chief. She picked up the medicine the village chief had brought, examined it for a moment, and realized that everyone had long noticed her discomfort in her throat.
0:49:9|0:49:12|At this moment, [Grandma] is in the yard, trying to catch a chicken to make soup for [Teacher] to nourish the body.
0:49:24|0:49:38|Grandma walked around the yard from left to right, but the rooster was too agile, so she couldn't catch it for a long time.
0:49:38|0:49:43|At this moment, she saw a basket sitting idle in the corner, and suddenly a suspicion arose in her heart.
0:50:4|0:50:8|[Yaya] saw the teacher in discomfort, and quickly went up to help her by patting her back with her small hands.
0:50:8|0:50:18|At this moment, [Grandma] set up a small trap with a basket and a rope tied to it. With a pull, the basket could be overturned, and if lucky, the chicken would be caught underneath.
0:50:18|0:50:23|Grandma seized the opportunity when a chicken happened to pass by, and quickly pulled it with force.
0:50:32|0:50:36|The chicken is caught now, and Grandma can finally cook chicken soup for [Fang Yan] the teacher.
0:50:36|0:50:39|In the field, Crow is gently massaging Fang Yan's back.
0:50:39|0:50:45|Seeing Yaya being so understanding, [Ma Dongmei] smiled with relief and then reached out to hug Yaya.
0:50:45|0:50:49|In the embrace, Fang Yan feels that love and being loved are a two-way process.
0:50:49|0:50:52|Her dry throat responded with difficulty.
0:50:55|0:51:0|In the evening, [Fang Yan] and [Yaya] have dinner together with their family.
0:52:47|0:52:54|[Fang Yan] couldn't stop coughing for a long time. During her water break, to her surprise, the children spontaneously started reading books to show their understanding towards her.
0:53:25|0:53:35|By the lake, [Fang Yan] looked at the waves lapping against the river, turbulent like the flowing water, representing her chaotic interests and the inevitable fate she could not escape.
0:53:52|0:54:2|He gazed at the shimmering lake with a trance-like expression, as the rivers flowed smoothly. He felt like a mere drift in the current, appearing so insignificant in front of the vast expanse of the lake.
0:54:2|0:54:7|And the various anomalies of the teacher have also been reflected in [Yaya]'s innocent eyes over the past few days.
0:54:8|0:54:12|Falling on his young heart, he worried endlessly about the teacher's health.
0:54:12|0:54:16|At the same time, he saw a beautiful pear on the table.
0:54:16|0:54:22|He remembered his grandmother saying that eating pears is good for the throat, so he decided to personally give the pear to the teacher.
0:54:22|0:54:32|He ran on the rugged country road, thinking, faster, even faster, maybe if the teacher eats this pear, she will get better soon, just like before.
0:54:32|0:54:35|His hurried footsteps echoed through the village like a classic melody.
0:54:36|0:54:45|Even though she fell heavily on the road all of a sudden, she endured the pain, stood up and continued running forward, because delivering the gift was more important.
0:54:45|0:54:52|She hurriedly ran from afternoon until sunset, finally arriving at the doorstep of [Yaya] teacher's house.
0:54:52|0:54:59|At this moment, the teacher was still conscientiously writing the lesson plan at the desk. [Yaya] patrolled at the door for a moment, and without caring to tidy herself up, she walked up to the front.
0:55:0|0:55:7|[Yaya] knocked on the door, and Fang Yan got up in surprise because she couldn't think of anyone who would come to see her at this hour.
0:55:7|0:55:20|Upon opening the door, what greeted her eyes was the petite figure of [Yaya].
0:55:20|0:55:28|Fang Yan squatted down and saw that [Yaya] was actually handing her two pears, and pointed with her right hand to indicate that she should eat them.
0:55:33|0:55:37|[Yaya] nodded heavily and followed the teacher into the house.
0:55:37|0:55:43|Her clothes were a bit dirty, with one hand always sneakily behind her back, hiding from the teacher's view.
0:55:58|0:56:7|Fang Yan gently pulled the hand hidden behind [Ya Ya], only to see the shocking scars on it, tears welled up in her eyes unconsciously.
0:56:7|0:56:16|Fang Yan took out some alcohol, wiped it with a cotton swab, then pulled [Yaya]'s injured hand over, carefully disinfecting it to prevent the wound from worsening and getting infected.
0:56:17|0:56:23|The wound looked like it had been heavily bruised, with the broken skin still oozing blood, appearing battered and bruised.
0:56:23|0:56:31|[Fang Yan] was disinfecting while tears kept streaming down her face uncontrollably. However, [Ya Ya] reached out her hand very sensibly and wiped away the tears on her face little by little.
0:56:31|0:56:41|[Yaya] looked at her with clear and focused eyes, slowly and firmly shook her head at her, just like she used to, protecting a fragile soul in her own way.
0:56:41|0:56:43|[Fang Yan] couldn't help but burst into tears.
0:57:17|0:57:21|The intense and sharp coughing made [Fang Yan] unable to continue speaking.
0:57:21|0:57:27|She lifted the hand that had just covered her mouth, which was now covered in blood, flowing down along the palm lines.
0:57:27|0:57:35|At night, [Ma Dongmei] sat at the table, lost in thought as she held her medical records. The diagnosis clearly stated that she was in the middle stage of throat cancer and urgently needed treatment.
0:57:35|0:57:42|[Fang Yan] was torn between continuing to teach in the village or following the doctor back to treat the sick, lost in memories of the past.
0:58:7|0:58:13|He remembered the moment when [Yaya] gave him a back massage and gifts, and thought of his grandmother personally making chicken soup for him to drink.
0:58:13|0:58:18|Every scene from the past is filled with genuine emotions and love, it is the beauty and happiness that cannot be abandoned.
0:58:18|0:58:25|In the past, he was filled with anger and tore up the medical records, seemingly deciding to let go of the child and first battle the illness.
0:58:27|0:58:33|On this day, unexpectedly, a small car from the city arrived on the mountain road where [Ma Dongmei] was patrolling in the area.
0:58:33|0:58:39|Fang Yan kept looking around on the roadside, just like the village chief in Chongqing, eagerly awaiting the arrival of the people in the car.
0:58:39|0:58:44|The scene cuts back to the car, it turns out her boyfriend is personally driving to pick her up.
0:58:45|0:58:56|In the incessant coughing of [Fang Yan], the car raced through the smoke and dust, attracting the attention of the crowd, until it drove into the narrow village road and finally stopped in front of [Fang Yan].
0:58:56|0:59:1|The man got out of the car and cast a loving gaze towards [Fang Yan].
0:59:1|0:59:13|The valley silently watched them, [Fang Yan] seemed to have finally decided to go back with her boyfriend. The two of them exchanged affectionate glances, but their eyes seemed to hide a thousand words. [Fang Yan] smiled and got into the car.
0:59:14|0:59:22|During the return journey, she couldn't help but think of the previous argument with her boyfriend over a chase and grab incident, when they discussed in the cave.
1:0:7|1:0:15|[Fang Yan] watched as her boyfriend walked away, tears streaming down her face, only to see him disappear through the gate of the yard.
1:0:15|1:0:25|From start to finish, she never looked back once. She stood in place, constantly pondering whether to focus on medical treatment or continue teaching. This decision was truly difficult to make.
1:0:25|1:0:32|After much deliberation, [Fang Yan] still refused to give up on this relationship. She made up her mind and decided to follow her boyfriend back.
1:0:33|1:0:53|[Yaya] stood on the top of the mountain, looking at the car driving away in the distance. The departure of the car seemed to take away her recently ignited enthusiasm and sincerity. A hint of loss could be seen in her eyes. She knew that if she didn't do something, she would forever lose her beloved teacher, because the teacher was leaving here, perhaps never to return.
1:1:3|1:1:22|The road was filled with smoke and dust, [Yaya] was running behind the car trying to catch up with them, while the uncomfortable [Fang Yan] glanced back and actually saw the figure of [Yaya].
1:1:22|1:1:26|[Fang Yan] slapped her boyfriend's arm, forcing him to pull over the car.
1:1:28|1:1:35|She pushed open the car door and dashed out with a big step, running towards [Yaya] who was chasing after her all the way.
1:1:35|1:1:45|[Yaya] wiped away her tears and ran towards her teacher, stumbling along the way. [Fang Yan] also welled up with tears, ran to her, squatted down, and hugged the exhausted [Yaya] who had run all the way.
1:1:45|1:1:48|She looked into [Yaya]'s eyes, full of tenderness.
1:1:52|1:2:11|[Fang Yan] wiped away [Ya Ya]'s tears with her hand, feeling a strong sense of guilt.
1:2:11|1:2:13|In the distance, [Boyfriend] helplessly rubbed his lower back.
1:2:19|1:2:33|Watching [Fang Yan] and [Yaya] hugging and crying, showing no intention of leaving, the boyfriend who had been compromising all along finally exploded.
1:2:33|1:2:39|Fang Yan looked at her angry boyfriend, even though there were attachments and reluctance, he still couldn't let go of [Yaya].
1:2:39|1:2:41|With the closing of the car door, [Fang Yan] finally burst into tears.
1:3:0|1:3:5|In the dust left by the departing vehicle, Fang Yan tightly embraced [Yaya] in her arms.
1:3:5|1:3:9|This is her reliance, her mission, and also her faith in this mountain village.
1:3:18|1:3:22|With the man's shout, the mountain village welcomed a new day.
1:3:22|1:3:27|The flags were flying in the courtyard, and [Fang Yan] once again stood on the platform to give a lecture to everyone.
1:4:13|1:4:15|[The Fool] carried a goose up the hill.
1:4:19|1:4:25|Crow stared at Fool for a long time, as if not knowing what he was doing.
1:4:25|1:4:29|[The Fool] runs around on the ridge with a goose in his arms, seemingly playing.
1:4:29|1:4:32|The goose struggled in his arms for a long time, looking very reluctant.
1:4:33|1:4:39|And [Yaya] sat on another hillside nearby, her young figure appearing so small in the midst of nature.
1:4:39|1:4:43|She turned her head and looked at the silhouette of the fool running on the mountain.
1:4:43|1:4:50|She suddenly noticed that the goose in the fool's hands was missing, and the fool was the only one looking around in confusion, muttering the name of the goose.
1:4:58|1:5:2|In the eyes of [Yaya], the figure of the fool was so anxious, pacing back and forth on the hillside.
1:5:6|1:5:17|The fool sat down on the hillside while searching for the way, all of which was seen by [Yaya]. But soon he stood up again, looking around, but still did not see the shadow of the goose.
1:5:17|1:5:23|The fool who lost the goose looks so anxious, his pain is like [Yaya] losing a teacher.
1:5:23|1:5:29|Thinking this way, [Yaya] decided to do something, like trying to help the fool find his goose back as if to make amends with the teacher.
1:5:30|1:5:40|Ya Ya lowered his head, thinking about where the goose might have gone. He looked at the small path below the mountain, as if there were traces of someone walking on it. He decided to follow the path and search for it himself.
1:5:40|1:5:50|He walked along the desolate path towards the forest, occasionally looking back as if he thought he would be back soon, so he didn't care about the time.
1:5:51|1:5:58|And at this moment, [Yaya]'s grandmother was already sitting on the kang at home, absentmindedly doing needlework in her hands.
1:5:58|1:6:5|As it was already evening, the young [Yaya] surprisingly had no shadow, usually she would have been back by this time.
1:6:5|1:6:10|Grandma glanced out the window, continued with the work in her hands, but couldn't shake off the worries in her heart.
1:6:10|1:6:17|At this moment, several barks suddenly came from outside. She quickly looked towards the courtyard, but still couldn't see [Ya Ya].
1:6:24|1:6:32|At this moment, [Yaya] is still running in the impoverished mountains, heading deeper, while the sky has completely darkened.
1:6:32|1:6:39|In the room, as the time grew later and later, [Grandma] became more and more worried, her mind not on the fire in her hands.
1:6:39|1:6:45|She was sewing while looking towards the gate of the courtyard, and accidentally pricked her finger with the needle.
1:6:48|1:6:57|Grandma put her wound into her mouth and licked it, feeling uneasy about [Yaya] who hadn't returned yet.
1:6:57|1:7:11|She put the cloth in her hand aside, immediately walked towards the door, then turned back halfway, picked up her hat and left.
1:7:50|1:7:59|The village chief stood up the microphone on his desk, ready to broadcast this to the villagers.
1:8:25|1:8:28|A group of people walked in the night carrying flashlights.
1:8:50|1:8:57|The villagers marched through the forest in a grand procession, calling out [Ya Ya]'s name in all directions.
1:9:45|1:9:52|And at this moment, [Yaya] was still alone in the dark forest, searching around as if she wasn't afraid at all.
1:9:52|1:9:57|Her figure appeared so small under the towering tree, causing concern for her safety.
1:10:9|1:10:15|Finally, after a night of searching, a familiar goose appeared in [Yaya]'s sight.
1:10:15|1:10:19|[Yaya] hurriedly walked towards the goose.
1:10:19|1:10:24|The goose, like a lost deer, obediently lay in the grass nest under the tree.
1:10:24|1:10:30|[Yaya] walked up to it, squatted down, and gently stroked the goose's back with her hand.
1:10:30|1:10:33|On the other side, everyone is still at a loss.
1:10:42|1:10:46|The dust-filled sky hung over [Yaya] and the goose like a hazy mist.
1:10:46|1:10:50|Ya Ya, who was determined to find the goose, now realizes that she has lost her way back.
1:10:55|1:11:1|At the same time, Teacher Fang Yan, who was deeply concerned about Yaya, finally entered the depths of the jungle.
1:11:1|1:11:9|She was holding a flashlight, wandering alone in the darkness, anxiously searching around. Yaya belatedly felt scared.
1:11:9|1:11:16|She dared not run around, holding the goose, sitting down against a big tree, holding her head in her hands, waiting for a possible turn of events.
1:11:16|1:11:23|As Fang Yan went deeper and deeper, she stepped on the damp soil, dragging her still not fully recovered body, searching around in the darkness.
1:11:27|1:11:34|Meanwhile, back at home, [Grandma] had a worried look on her face. A little girl in the mountains, it was just too dangerous for her, and [Grandma] couldn't help but feel anxious.
1:12:1|1:12:5|He was not sure what it was, so he hurried forward to take a closer look.
1:12:5|1:12:9|He bent down and took a closer look, and realized that the crow squatting in front of him was indeed Yaya.
1:12:39|1:12:45|Fang Yan stood up, holding Ya Ya's hand, her tense nerves finally relaxed, and a wave of dizziness came over her.
1:12:45|1:12:51|Fang Yan suddenly lost focus in her eyes, her legs unable to support the weight of her body, and fell in front of Ya Ya.
1:12:55|1:13:4|The clean horse chestnut curtain on the window sill of the cave dwelling quietly unfolds, the flowers swaying gracefully in the sunlight, while the person living inside has long disappeared.
1:13:4|1:13:16|Grandma and [Yaya] came to the cave where the teacher used to live, helping her pack up clothes and miscellaneous items. Grandma sat on the bed, folding clothes, occasionally wiping away the tears on her face, and then continued to organize the clothes in her hands.
1:13:16|1:13:27|[Yaya] patiently organized the teacher's lesson plans and textbooks in front of the table, looking obedient. However, the person who wrote the lesson plans had already fallen in the dim forest, lying in the hospital.
1:13:27|1:13:40|Stacking the cards, Grandma suddenly stopped her movements, unable to contain her heartache for [Fang Yan], because at this moment, [Fang Yan] was still lying unconscious in the hospital bed, with her lips showing a sickly dryness, and her eyes tightly shut.
1:13:41|1:13:49|Grandma gently touched [Fang Yan]'s face, looking at her tightly closed eyes, couldn't help but recall the time when she begged the doctor for treatment.
1:14:21|1:14:26|Thinking of the scene where she begged for the teacher, Grandma couldn't help but burst into tears.
1:14:26|1:14:35|And at this moment, [Ya Ya], who was tidying up the table, accidentally turned on the recorder, and [Fang Yan]'s voice could be heard coming from it.
1:15:28|1:15:32|Grandma lowered her head, the pain on her face deepened by a fraction.
1:16:36|1:16:43|The sound of the radio not only touched [Yaya] and her grandmother, but also reached the ears of her boyfriend Shaofeng thousands of miles away.
1:16:48|1:16:53|He left his job in the city and drove to the hospital in the county to visit [Fang Yan].
1:17:1|1:17:4|The experience of him [Yaya] Fang Yan shouting loudly is still fresh in my mind.
1:17:4|1:17:8|Feeling guilty constantly welled up in her heart as she drove.
1:17:8|1:17:15|Driving over the Great Wall bridge, passing through day and night, [Shao Feng] finally rushed into the hospital with a bright and dazzling look.
1:17:27|1:17:35|At this moment, [Fang Yan] was still lying quietly on the bed, not yet regaining consciousness. [Shang Feng] passed through a series of hospital rooms and finally tremblingly pushed open the door.
1:17:38|1:17:55|In front of her, [Fang Yan] looked so weak, with a tired look of recovering from a serious illness on her face. She gazed at the continuously dripping IV drip with a hint of fear, hesitating for a moment and even not daring to approach. Sitting by the bed, she gently held [Fang Yan]'s weak right hand, with so much to say to her.
1:17:55|1:17:57|But Fang Yan remained silent, unconscious.
1:17:58|1:18:5|She gently caressed Fang Yan's hand, buried her face in Fang Yan's hand, and finally burst into tears. 
1:18:5|1:18:16|By the familiar hillside in the village, [Yaya] sat on the grass, holding the textbook given to her by Teacher Fang Yan, studying it carefully, trying hard to learn pronunciation from the teacher's subtle clues.
1:19:44|1:19:55|After listening to the doctor's advice on artificial cochlea, Shang Feng returned to his office and carefully searched for relevant information on the computer, occasionally making notes with a pen.
1:19:55|1:20:3|In order to advance the project of artificial cochlea, [Shang Feng] is alone in the office researching, hoping to gain a deeper understanding of this technology.
1:20:7|1:20:15|The night had deepened like undiluted ink, and the night watch was dozing off wearily, only to startle awake just before their head hit the table.
1:20:15|1:20:18|After putting on the glasses, [Ma Dongmei] continued to open the computer and look up relevant information.
1:20:20|1:20:29|The long night slowly passed, with only [Shao Feng] pushing forward the plan intensively, as this plan was like a hope for [Fang Yan], a dream she had been longing for.
1:20:29|1:20:35|Early the next morning, the female secretary called to the office stood at the door.
1:20:38|1:20:43|The female secretary walked quickly to Shao Feng, holding a file in her arms.
1:21:12|1:21:15|Listen, [Female Secretary] walked out of the room with a smile.
1:21:17|1:21:26|Half a year passed like a play, with each village primary school merging into a new school in the township. With the care and support from the government and various sectors of society, the teaching conditions have greatly improved.
1:21:26|1:21:28|The flag-raising ceremony was held again that day.
1:21:30|1:21:35|During this period, Teacher Fang's touching deeds have also attracted widespread attention from various sectors of society.
1:21:35|1:21:41|Viewers were moved by her sincere original intention and persistent perseverance, and they all hailed her as [Yuan Shou].
1:21:41|1:21:48|Little [Yaya], under the guidance of Teacher Fang, has made great progress in speaking and daily learning through her own efforts.
1:21:49|1:21:55|During today's flag-raising ceremony, accompanied by the gaze of the crowd and the majestic national anthem, [Ya Ya] walked step by step onto the rostrum.
1:21:55|1:21:58|Today is the day she speaks.
1:21:58|1:22:5|Every syllable she utters, every piece of knowledge she possesses, is hidden in Teacher Fang's every word and action, concealed in every ordinary yet shining day.
1:22:5|1:22:14|She was born in the wilderness, born in the silent and soundless world, but only illuminated by this beam of light from the teacher.
1:22:14|1:22:17|From then on, colorful notes also appeared in her world.
1:22:18|1:22:29|In front of the window stands an elegant lotus flower, both flowers and people will encounter various misfortunes, but the river of life is endless, there will always be wordless and warm light falling on us.
1:22:29|1:22:38|[Yaya] looked down at the old radio placed on the chair below, which had been used by Teacher Fang. In her eyes, it was as if the teacher was still sitting there watching her.
1:23:56|1:24:4|Speak, [Yaya] bowed deeply, with the eight characters "Respecting teachers and following the right path, educating and nurturing talents" shining brightly in the sunlight behind her.
1:24:4|1:24:10|Waking up at some point, Fang Yan lay on the hospital bed and also heard Crow's recitation through the tape recorder.
1:24:10|1:24:19|Shao Fang sat beside her hospital bed, looking affectionately at [Ya Ya], reaching out to touch her skin as if comforting her, everything was falling into place.
1:24:19|1:24:22|[Fang Yan] tightly held [Shao Fang]'s hand, showing a relieved smile.
1:24:32|1:24:36|At the transition of day and night, a new day dawns.
