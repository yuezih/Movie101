0:0:50|0:0:57|Next, the hanging photos rotated to the front one by one, with the eyes of each person in the photos covered.
0:0:57|0:1:5|Soon after, the photos formed a circle.
0:1:54|0:2:1|Suddenly, the sturdy line became more numerous, and the photos interspersed in the middle changed from one person to two, three people.
0:2:1|0:2:10|They seemed to be having a conversation, and then, a high-voltage transmission tower appeared in the middle of the frame, with numerous high-voltage lines hanging on both sides.
0:2:10|0:2:12|One afternoon, at the icehouse in the outskirts.
0:2:12|0:2:21|Outside the icehouse, there are abandoned wooden frames piled up at the entrance, and the walls are painted white. Due to the long-term erosion by rain, the original cement color is exposed.
0:2:22|0:2:27|Suddenly, two vans drove into the bumpy road outside the icehouse.
0:2:27|0:2:36|The person sitting inside rested their arm on the car window, surveying the dilapidated buildings around. Then, the van turned into a grass-covered path.
0:2:36|0:2:40|Suddenly, a black sedan appeared at the entrance.
0:2:40|0:2:50|The man in the passenger seat is wearing a pair of black sunglasses and has a Bluetooth earpiece on his ear. After glancing at the direction of the van, he focuses his gaze on the screen in front of him.
0:2:51|0:2:57|At this moment, a group of men in the ice warehouse stood on either side of the conveyor belt, watching the man in the middle counting the money.
0:2:57|0:3:2|On the other side, a henchman pushed aside the broken ice and took out a white package.
0:3:3|0:3:13|One of them had a camera hidden in his belt, recording every move of everyone present. On the other end of the camera was the man sitting in the car, staring intently at the screen.
0:3:14|0:3:18|In the icehouse, a man's phone rings, and he answers it slowly.
0:3:22|0:3:29|Ashun immediately poured the white powder into the water tank and flushed it down the drain with water.
0:3:29|0:3:35|Ah Gou observed the expressions of everyone.
0:3:40|0:3:46|Li Cangdong's colleague next to him said anxiously. He stared at a person on the screen and suddenly frowned.
0:3:50|0:3:55|In the icehouse, undercover agent Xi Gui, after receiving the order, threw the bag filled with banknotes towards the opposite side, then immediately tackled and wrestled with them on the ground.
0:4:0|0:4:5|The sudden sound of gunshots made [Li Cangdong], sitting in front of the screen, tense. Then, a large number of people wearing bulletproof vests rushed towards the ice storage.
0:4:6|0:4:11|On the other side, the man hiding in the corner watched in panic as the undercover agent and the drug dealer fought each other.
0:4:12|0:4:19|Soon after, the gun that the two were fighting for fell in front of him. Being timid, he cautiously peeked out and looked at the gun, while the undercover agent in danger spoke.
0:4:38|0:4:43|Fleeing [A Di] looked around in panic upon hearing the police's voices.
0:4:43|0:4:47|Next, he immediately crawled under the machine, and at this moment, a large number of police officers rushed in.
0:5:22|0:5:28|After speaking, he reached out to [Li Cangdong]. And [Li Cangdong] calmly took out an envelope. He looked at the envelope in his hand.
0:5:44|0:5:50|But he didn't listen at all, suddenly turned around and pointed at [Li Cangdong].
0:5:51|0:5:57|And [Li Cangdong] calmly looked at him and said.
0:6:0|0:6:3|Li Cangdong, who was slapped, looked guiltily at the man who slammed the door and left.
0:6:3|0:6:8|A man walked quickly on the street, looking around vigilantly.
0:6:8|0:6:17|Continuing on, he cradled the backpack in his arms, but as he turned the corner, he suddenly stopped in his tracks, his eyes filled with fear as he looked ahead.
0:6:17|0:6:24|On the other side, [A Di] is closely watched by two henchmen. Then three henchmen emerge from the alley next to him.
0:6:24|0:6:33|At this moment, the man was so scared that he stood there dumbfounded. Then, he picked up the fallen backpack, put it back on his shoulder, and ran into the alley next to him.
0:6:33|0:6:39|Due to the darkness, the man tripped over the storage baskets piled on both sides and fell to the ground.
0:6:40|0:6:44|In a panic, he grabbed the vegetable basket and quickly got up, without even looking at the backpack beside him, and ran off.
0:6:46|0:6:52|Suddenly, at the corner, [A Gou] took a big step forward and swung his large knife towards the man.
0:6:52|0:6:56|At this moment, the man who had been stabbed several times fled in all directions, and then he hid in a narrow crevice.
0:6:58|0:7:11|And in the darkness, with his arm bleeding profusely, he was still discovered. Then, the man started to step back, and at this moment, [A Gou] rushed over upon his companions' call, holding a knife tightly and approaching menacingly.
0:7:15|0:7:20|As the man fell to the ground, his companions behind him stepped forward and stabbed the knife into his leg.
0:7:30|0:7:41|He quickly stood up and crawled towards the stairs. At this moment, he saw hope because at the end of the stairs on the right was the exit, so he lay on the iron railing and shouted loudly.
0:7:46|0:7:52|Desperately wanting to get out, he stretched half of his body outside through the crack.
0:8:0|0:8:9|[A Gou] unwillingly turned and left. The man at this moment was slumped against the iron gate, his face twisted in a grimace, one hand gripping the iron bars.
0:8:9|0:8:12|A hand tightly grips the iron pillar outside the door.
0:8:12|0:8:18|On the other side, [Li Cangdong] sat on the edge of the bed in dim lighting. He lowered his head, deep in thought.
0:8:28|0:8:35|Next, [Li Cangdong] and his colleague appeared at the bar.
0:8:42|0:8:50|Before long, [Li Cangdong] who was leaning on the bar slowly lifted his head and looked at the glass of wine.
0:8:58|0:9:6|Suddenly, his attention was caught by a beautiful woman, who, sitting across from him, raised her glass in response after meeting his gaze.
0:9:6|0:9:14|The two were being eroded by the ambiguous atmosphere of the bar, but [Li Cangdong] was just venting his frustration under the influence of alcohol.
0:9:14|0:9:22|Soon after, the screen gradually showed a crisscross of iron wires, and the entwined iron wires eventually formed the two characters "line" and "person".
0:9:22|0:9:30|A year later, in the middle of the tall buildings, the sky was clear and sunny, with not a single cloud in sight.
0:9:31|0:9:36|Soon after, through the transparent glass on the door, [Li Cangdong] could be seen slowly climbing the stairs.
0:9:36|0:9:40|And he, expressionless, opened the door and walked in as usual.
0:9:40|0:9:48|He then pressed the doorbell on the wall and pushed open the glass door to walk in. At this moment, the man at the front desk said.
0:11:8|0:11:15|At this moment, his gaze was vacant, but he spoke earnestly. On the other side, a car in the alley.
0:12:0|0:12:5|At night, the rain-soaked streets were wet, with shallow puddles reflecting the tall buildings.
0:12:5|0:12:12|The elevator door opened, and [Li Cangdong] walked out, holding a stack of books in one hand and a briefcase in the other.
0:12:12|0:12:18|He then walked straight to a closed security door, unlocked it with a key, and walked in.
0:12:18|0:12:26|He then casually turned on the room's light, walked towards the table in the middle, placed the stack of books in his hand down, and then walked towards the innermost part.
0:12:26|0:12:32|He stood in front of the table, holding a pot of boiling instant noodles, eating and busy at the same time.
0:12:43|0:12:51|The next day, a motorcycle and a car crossed each other on the dual carriageway outside the Bihu Prison.
0:12:51|0:13:0|Shortly after, the bald man stood in front of the gate, waiting for the prison guard to open it. The prison guard escorting him followed him inside.
0:13:0|0:13:7|The bald man walked straight ahead and, upon seeing [Li Cangdong] gesturing with his arm behind a pillar, glanced at the prison guard behind him. He stood in front of [Li Cangdong].
0:13:15|0:13:22|And as he looked towards the prison guard beside him, he immediately pulled out a cigarette. When he lit it up, [Li Cangdong]'s superior helped him light it.
0:13:24|0:13:31|After taking a deep drag of his cigarette, he said to him. He withdrew his gaze from [Li Cangdong]'s boss and slumped onto the table.
0:14:36|0:14:40|After speaking, Captain [Li Cangdong] left from behind [Xi Gui], while [Xi Gui] remained standing in place.
0:14:40|0:14:47|At dusk, [Li Cangdong]'s boss drives a car while talking on the phone.
0:14:52|0:14:57|In the evening, on the bustling street, [Li Cangdong] parked his car next to the book stall at the corner.
0:14:57|0:15:6|The next day, Li Cangdong's boss came to the dance studio after the boss put a bundle of newspapers on the front passenger seat and drove away.
0:15:36|0:15:39|The beauty found a black bag under the desk in the office.
0:15:56|0:16:0|At this moment, [Li Cangdong]'s boss approached the elevator and was about to press the button when the elevator rang.
0:16:0|0:16:7|As the elevator door opens, a middle-aged man with glasses and a man also wearing glasses step out.
0:16:7|0:16:13|The two walked towards the direction of [Li Cangdong]'s boss, who had already hidden in the stairwell at that time.
0:16:13|0:16:22|The next day, Xi Gui, who was released from prison, walked desolately on the road. Not far from him, someone was staring at him intently. Soon after, he made a phone call to his companion.
0:16:26|0:16:32|Late at night, the once bustling street is now deserted with only a few scattered individuals and trash littering the ground.
0:16:32|0:16:38|Xi Gui was leaning against the utility pole across from the Yongxing Hotel, carefully observing every move at the hotel.
0:16:40|0:16:47|Suddenly, a white commercial van appeared at the entrance of the Yongxing Hotel. The man driving the van got out and opened the back door, saying:
0:16:54|0:17:2|Upon seeing his younger sister, [Xi Gui] picked up the nearby bucket of slop water and splashed it directly at the man leaning against the car door. He then quickly pulled his frightened sister away.
0:17:4|0:17:8|Unexpectedly, the fleeing duo ran into the loan sharks coming out of the store head-on.
0:17:8|0:17:14|As Xi Gui stepped back, the opponents subdued them one by one. Xi Gui was thrown on the street and beaten up by the group.
0:17:42|0:17:46|After finishing his loan shark speech, [Xi Gui] turned around and pulled his younger sister back.
0:17:46|0:17:52|At this moment, the road is covered with the fresh blood of [Xi Gui], and with blood all over his face, he tries to stand up.
0:17:52|0:17:56|He twisted his painful body and propped himself up on his side.
0:17:56|0:18:3|He then dragged his agonizing body forward, but didn't take a few steps. Suddenly, he noticed that there were police officers passing by ahead.
0:18:3|0:18:7|He immediately turned around and ran in the opposite direction.
0:18:7|0:18:13|At this moment, the hazy late night appeared even more mysterious, and under the dim light, his diminishing figure was reflected.
0:18:14|0:18:21|On the other side, [Li Cangdong] stood under the bridge holding fruits, gazing ahead, while the woman beside him said
0:18:39|0:18:48|After that, [Li Cangdong] took the thing from the woman's hand. Then, he walked straight ahead.
0:18:48|0:18:53|Soon after, the destitute [Fei Weng] was devouring his food voraciously.
0:18:53|0:19:0|Fei Weng didn't even listen to him. Instead, after putting the food into his mouth, he suddenly tilted his head back and took a sip of beer.
0:19:1|0:19:7|Shortly after, [Fei Weng] looked around and instinctively dodged when he saw [Li Cangdong] trying to serve him food.
0:19:7|0:19:15|He then took another sip of beer and started to size up [Li Cangdong]. However, [Li Cangdong] patiently continued to cook for him.
0:19:20|0:19:25|At this moment, [Fei Weng] was shivering in the wind, and the chopsticks were also tapping on the soda can.
0:19:37|0:19:40|Paused his actions and looked at him.
0:19:43|0:19:50|With a furrowed brow, [Li Cangdong] silently puts the vegetables into the pot. Meanwhile, on the other side, a white car is set off with an alarm by someone.
0:19:50|0:19:58|Hiding in the corner, [Xi Gui] had his hands in the pockets of his jacket as he turned his head to look at the car that set off the alarm.
0:19:58|0:20:4|When no one was around, he approached the car, opened the hood, quickly located the alarm wire, and cut it off.
0:20:4|0:20:17|Following that, he used a device to touch the car door's wiring, and once the door was successfully opened, he quickly got into the car and connected the car's ignition device to a simple device, smoothly starting the car with a skilled process.
0:20:17|0:20:27|Shortly after, Xi Gui drove his car out of the side road, and just as he was about to accelerate, a black car suddenly appeared in front of him, blocking his way.
0:20:27|0:20:33|At this moment, after the person in the front passenger seat got off the car, the car turned its head towards him.
0:20:33|0:20:40|After the car's headlights turned off, he finally saw the person across from him. And [Li Cangdong] looked towards the passenger seat and said.
0:20:53|0:21:0|He [Xi Gui] took off his hat, gently touching the wound on his forehead, while [Li Cangdong] gazed straight ahead.
0:21:2|0:21:11|After a long silence, Xi Gui, who had not spoken for a long time, hesitated for a moment before speaking. Li Cangdong at this moment left him no room for maneuver.
0:21:11|0:21:21|In the car, the two people stared at each other intently. Xi Gui, with a vacant look in his eyes, looked down in confusion.
0:21:21|0:21:29|Suddenly, a racing car and a motorcycle appeared on the road next to the railway tracks, slowly driving into the open space filled with racing cars.
0:21:29|0:21:36|And just as Xi Gui parked the car, all eyes on the scene turned to this unfamiliar race car.
0:21:36|0:21:44|Xi Gui got out of the car. With a bandage on his head, he found the organizer of the race and listened to him explain the rules of the track.
0:21:44|0:21:50|And not far away, someone was filming all of this.
0:21:56|0:22:2|Xi Gui leaned against the car, gazing at them. At that moment, a man in a black shirt walked towards him.
0:22:8|0:22:15|After listening, the man in black took out his phone from his pocket. Meanwhile, someone hiding in the dark was capturing every detail.
0:22:15|0:22:19|On the other side, [Li Cangdong] answered the phone.
0:22:23|0:22:29|Suddenly, a racing car burst out, leading the pack with cars of various colors closely following behind.
0:22:29|0:22:33|At this moment, [Xi Gui] is driving a white car and preparing to overtake.
0:22:33|0:22:39|He observed the movements of the racing car ahead, found the opportunity to quickly pull alongside, and contemptuously looked at the opponent with his eyes.
0:22:39|0:22:48|At the turn, a car suddenly blocked the road, forcing Xi Gui and the vehicles in front of him to brake urgently.
0:22:58|0:23:7|On the other side, the harassed Xi Gui quickly adjusted his state and overtook a racing car by using the bend to overtake, with a frown on his forehead and greater pressure hidden in his heart.
0:23:16|0:23:21|At this moment, a scene suddenly appeared in his mind: his younger sister being chased on the street.
0:23:21|0:23:29|Following that, with a fierce look on his face, he attempted to overtake once again at the final bend, but the car he had just passed was closely tailing him.
0:23:29|0:23:34|And as he adjusted, the vehicle behind him crashed into the rear of his car.
0:23:34|0:23:40|So he quickly turned the steering wheel to park the car on the side of the road, in order to prevent the opponent from hitting again.
0:23:40|0:23:46|Finally, as the opponent passed by him, he returned to the right track and stepped on the gas pedal, catching up.
0:23:46|0:23:52|At this moment, he no longer fears, quickly overtaking the vehicles ahead, but causing the car to collide with the roadside fence.
0:23:52|0:23:58|Sparks flew as the car crashed, and the vehicle that had just hit him looked a bit flustered upon seeing him.
0:23:58|0:24:10|He firmly adjusted his speed and quickly accelerated from the outside lane towards the front, pressing the vehicle that was about to collide with him behind. At this moment, all the race cars entered the tunnel one by one.
0:24:10|0:24:17|A large number of police cars, led by traffic police, arrived at the entrance and exit of the tunnel. On the other side, a racing team led by [Xi Gui] is chasing each other inside the tunnel.
0:24:17|0:24:21|Suddenly, [Captain] received a phone call.
0:24:29|0:24:34|[Xi Gui] quickly turned around and drove in the opposite direction.
0:24:40|0:24:44|Waiting for him at the entrance, however, were a large number of police officers.
0:25:8|0:25:16|Stealthily, [Xi Gui] crept through the bushes, climbed up the nearby hill, and then crossed over it to reach the road below.
0:25:16|0:25:28|Just as he was calming his anxious heart, the phone in his pocket rang.
0:25:29|0:25:37|On the other side, [Li Cangdong's Boss] sat in the mahjong hall, and behind him walked a bald fat man with a scar on his face.
0:26:33|0:26:37|When she finally recognized that it was indeed her brother, she hurried forward and embraced him.
0:26:37|0:26:42|At this moment, her brother's broad shoulders brought her a long-lost sense of security.
0:26:42|0:26:52|When Xi Gui's Younger Sister saw her sister unharmed, tears welled up in her eyes. She comforted her sister with one hand, and the two embraced tightly on the street, unwilling to part for a long time.
0:26:52|0:26:59|The next day, Li Cangdong's Boss just got off the subway. Soon after, he headed straight towards the residential area covered by iron mesh.
0:26:59|0:27:7|He then arrived at the commercial building inside the residential area. Just as he entered the children's area, Xi Gui's Younger Sister appeared behind him.
0:27:7|0:27:12|At this moment, [Xi Gui's Younger Sister] was walking and smoking a cigarette, carefully observing her surroundings.
0:27:12|0:27:16|And [Li Cangdong's Boss] had already passed through the children's area, shuttling between various shops.
0:27:17|0:27:23|The flags on the shop signs fluttered high, prominently reminding passersby of the types and varieties of goods available.
0:27:23|0:27:29|The fixed area limited the display of their products, occupying the aisles and making the distance between shops narrow.
0:27:30|0:27:37|Due to the fast pace of [Li Cangdong's Boss], [Xi Gui's Younger Sister] got lost, so he blindly chose a path and walked in.
0:27:56|0:28:1|Shortly after, [Li Cangdong's Boss] walked out of the room with an incense stick, squatted down, and inserted the incense into the ground at the door.
0:28:1|0:28:10|And at this moment, Xi Gui's Younger Sister also entered the residential building, searching for the clues left by Li Cangdong's Boss for him.
0:28:48|0:28:54|Xi Gui closed his eyes in resignation.
0:29:8|0:29:19|After speaking, [Li Cangdong] took out a black folder from his handbag and handed the documents inside to [Xi Gui], who was leaning on his head and looking at him disdainfully.
0:29:53|0:30:3|Following that, [Li Cangdong] put the documents into an envelope, took out beeswax and a seal, melted the beeswax, dripped it on the opening of the envelope, and then stamped it with his exclusive seal.
0:30:3|0:30:9|Late at night, [Tai Ping] took [Xi Gui] on a speedboat to a boat anchored in the center of the lake, and said to him.
0:30:38|0:30:40|After speaking, [La Zhan] stood up and sat back down on the stool.
0:30:40|0:30:47|At the same time, fearing being accidentally injured, [Bao Zhu] saw the two of them stop the fighting and pulled a chair back to the table.
0:30:47|0:30:51|Sister-in-law walked out of the cabin and sat in an empty seat, passing by the others.
0:30:52|0:30:59|At this moment, [Tai Ping] immediately stood up, picked up the bottle of wine to pour a drink for his sister-in-law, who smiled at him and held the cup with her hand.
0:31:0|0:31:5|Later, Sister-in-law noticed Xi Gui and looked at him as if she had seen him somewhere before.
0:31:7|0:31:11|[Tai Ping] put down his wine glass, walked to the side, and discussed something with [Hua Tian].
0:31:11|0:31:18|The chandelier on the boat swayed with the wind, casting a flickering light on [Hua Tian]'s face. Then, the two sat at the table.
0:31:32|0:31:41|[Hua Tian] nodded in satisfaction and then looked at [Xi Gui].
0:31:55|0:32:0|After pouring out the tea in [A Di]'s cup, [Hua Tian] filled it with wine and, seeing her silent, asked.
0:32:2|0:32:9|With a dejected look, [A Di] slowly lifted his head after a moment of hesitation, looking at him solemnly before speaking.
0:32:18|0:32:21|[Hua Tian] forced a smile and went along with it.
0:32:21|0:32:30|While [A Di] raised the cup of wine behind him and then picked up the teapot.
0:32:46|0:32:52|[Li Cangdong] looked helplessly at the computer screen, pressed a few keys, and then spoke to him again.
0:32:52|0:33:1|After speaking, [Li Cangdong] turned around to start working, while at this moment, [Xi Gui] was in a daze, playing with the stick in his mouth without speaking.
0:33:6|0:33:15|Xi Gui stopped his actions and said. After a moment of thought, Li Cangdong spoke.
0:33:17|0:33:32|Subsequently, various vehicles lined up on both sides of the street, with Xi Gui leaning against a car door, cigarette in his mouth and a cigarette case in his hand. Looking around, he stopped his actions when he saw A Di, who then threw a bag at him.
0:33:33|0:33:40|With a puzzled look on his face, [Xi Gui] took the bag and went to change clothes. At that moment, [A Di] sat in the passenger seat, smoking a cigarette, waiting for him.
0:33:40|0:33:48|Before long, Xi Gui, who had changed his clothes, opened the back door of the car to put the bag in, and then sat in the driver's seat.
0:33:48|0:34:6|Xi Gui is driving the car, while A Di is sitting next to her lost in thought. Suddenly, the phone rings, breaking the silence. A Di takes out her phone and sees a new message, which reads, "Now is not the time, get rid of the baby." She then dials a number.
0:34:13|0:34:21|After a moment, Xi Gui and Li Cangdong appeared on a bustling street, crossed the busy zebra crossing, and walked straight into a jewelry store.
0:34:21|0:34:28|A serious-looking [A Di] walked at the front, followed closely by [Xi Gui], carrying bags of various sizes.
0:34:28|0:34:36|Later, Xi Gui pushed open the shop door for A Di, but A Di did not respond, instead looking around at the gold and silver jewelry.
0:34:36|0:34:42|Next, Xi Gui, who entered the store, looked towards the surveillance camera in the corner.
0:34:44|0:34:50|The salesperson looked towards the counter. [A Di] responded casually to the smiling salesperson.
0:34:50|0:34:53|After sitting down, she fixed her gaze on the engagement rings in the counter.
0:34:55|0:35:1|Standing behind, Xi Gui remained silent, while A Di raised his head thoughtfully and looked at the shop assistant.
0:35:6|0:35:16|Shortly after, the salesperson reached into the counter and took out a ring. Meanwhile, standing behind, [Xi Gui] suddenly shifted his gaze from the ring to the security guard outside the glass window who was holding a letter.
0:35:16|0:35:21|Just as he looked at the clock inside the store, [A Di] suddenly stood up.
0:35:46|0:35:49|Night falls quietly amidst the sounds of revelry.
0:35:49|0:35:55|At this moment, the two of them are sitting at a roadside stall, enjoying hotpot. [A Di] says to the waitress who is serving the dishes.
0:35:56|0:36:2|He Xi Gui immediately stopped what she was doing and looked at him, glaring fiercely at his brother A Di and shouted.
0:36:4|0:36:11|Before long, three barrels of beer appeared in front of them. Holding a cigarette, [Xi Gui] opened a bottle of beer and reached for an empty glass.
0:36:11|0:36:17|While pouring the wine, [A Di] snatched the bottle with a look of disdain, then gestured to clink glasses.
0:36:17|0:36:35|Xi Gui immediately picked up the bottle and clinked it with his, took the cigarette out of his mouth, and started drinking. A Di, on the other hand, tilted her head back and chugged the drink, with the liquid sliding down her mouth, but she showed no intention of stopping, continuing to close her eyes tightly and gulp down the beer. After taking a big sip, Xi Gui put down the bottle and looked at her.
0:36:36|0:36:41|Late at night, the vendors had already gone home, leaving only the lights on the dining table to stand guard.
0:36:41|0:36:46|While heavily drunk, [A Di] leaned against the rolling door behind him, with one foot still propped up on a stool.
0:36:46|0:36:55|After taking a big sip of beer, she looked at Xi Gui, who was smiling bitterly beside her, and said.
0:37:9|0:37:14|Xi Gui is being chased by the police on the street, while A Di is being pursued by members of the gang on the other side.
0:37:20|0:37:27|The police chased after the gangsters, but the two of them managed to escape. [A Di] glanced at [Xi Gui], then lowered his head and said.
0:37:35|0:37:42|[A Di]'s hand on the bottle kept shaking, suddenly, she lifted her heavy head and pointed at [Xi Gui].
0:37:43|0:37:52|At this moment, Xi Gui looked at her with a puzzled expression on his face, but she responded with a smile. Then, she forced herself to sit up straight despite her fatigue, but kept her eyes tightly closed.
0:38:24|0:38:26|[A Di] immersed himself in joy as he recalled the past.
0:38:26|0:38:38|Suddenly, the smiling face turned serious. At this moment, her heart was warm. After speaking, she let out a cold laugh.
0:38:38|0:38:41|Then, he picked up the bottle and clinked it against Xi Gui's bottle.
0:38:43|0:38:54|She, who was on the verge of tears, drank the remaining wine in one gulp. She used to trust him so much, but now, he doesn't care at all. He even made her get rid of her own flesh and blood.
0:38:54|0:39:4|At this moment, [A Di] was in excruciating pain, and in her alcohol-induced stupor, she slumped down. Sitting across from her, [Xi Gui] immediately reached out to support her head and slowly placed it on the table.
0:39:4|0:39:7|He [Xi Gui] couldn't help but feel a tug at his heart as he looked at her.
0:39:8|0:39:22|After calming down, Li Cangdong looked at Xi Gui, who reached into her bag and took out her phone. Xi Gui then lowered her head and transferred the data from her phone to her own. In no time, Xi Gui put Adi's phone back.
0:39:22|0:39:26|But he felt very uneasy in his heart, feeling guilty towards [A Di] and his own trust.
0:39:26|0:39:31|But having promised [Li Cangdong], he, driven by the urgency to save his sister, chose the latter.
0:39:31|0:39:40|Later, he looked at the figure in front of him and felt a sudden pang of heartache. He stood up, picked up the coat placed aside, and walked slowly to [A Di]'s side.
0:39:40|0:39:49|He covered the coat over [A Di]'s body. Moments later, the dim streetlights slanted down on the street, and the buildings lit up one by one.
0:39:49|0:39:57|At the entrance of a house, a stick of incense was lit in front of the Earth God statue. [Li Cangdong] took the memory card handed to him by [Xi Gui] and looked at it.
0:40:20|0:40:26|Disappointed, Xi Gui slowly lowered his head.
0:40:40|0:40:52|With a furrowed brow, [Li Cangdong] looked at him in contemplation, but he couldn't afford to be soft-hearted. So he turned around, let down his guard, lowered his head, swallowed hard, and sincerely said to [Xi Gui].
0:41:46|0:41:50|Sitting in the car, [Li Cangdong] carefully observed the streets on both sides.
0:41:50|0:41:57|Suddenly, a couple walked out of the shop door not far away. After embracing each other at the door, they walked in different directions.
0:41:57|0:42:0|At the same time, Li Cangdong's phone rang.
0:42:20|0:42:28|After speaking, the taxi stopped by the street. [Li Cangdong] got off the car, observed the vehicles on both sides, and then quickly ran towards the street on the opposite side.
0:42:28|0:42:36|The man who had just walked out of the store was briskly moving through the crowd, and at that moment, [Li Cangdong] across the street noticed him.
0:42:36|0:42:43|Li Cangdong, who stopped in his tracks, carefully observed his every move. The more he looked, the more he felt something was wrong, so he turned and walked towards the direction he was heading.
0:42:52|0:42:58|At this moment, all the teammates hidden in the crowd are searching for the suspect based on the characteristics provided by [Li Cangdong].
0:42:58|0:43:3|Walking on the opposite street, [Li Cangdong] closely watched every move of the man.
0:43:4|0:43:11|Suddenly, the man looked up at the building next to him and then walked in. [Li Cangdong], who was following closely behind, immediately called out to his companion.
0:43:12|0:43:20|Gu Zi quickly caught up, and then, a female Gu Zi stood guard at the entrance.
0:43:20|0:43:27|In the building, [Hua Tian] stood in the crowd waiting for the elevator, while Gu Zi and his companions caught up, walking forward while concealing communication devices.
0:43:28|0:43:36|Before long, the elevator doors slowly opened, and [Hua Tian] walked in first, followed by [Shi Zai] and his companions entering nonchalantly.
0:43:37|0:43:42|After the elevator doors closed, [Hua Tian] reached out from behind and pressed the button for the 10th floor.
0:43:42|0:43:51|[Shi Zai] decisively pressed the button for the 8th floor next to the 10th floor. However, his companion pressed the button for the 12th floor, creating an extremely tense atmosphere inside the elevator.
0:43:51|0:44:0|After a moment, they arrived at the 8th floor. Acting nonchalantly, [Shi Zai] leisurely walked out of the elevator. As soon as the elevator doors closed, he immediately ran towards the stairwell on the side.
0:44:0|0:44:9|Just as he was running towards the 10th floor with all his might, he ran into [Hua Tian] who was coming down the stairs. At that moment, he became cautious and then informed [Li Cangdong].
0:44:26|0:44:29|[Hua Tian], who sensed something was amiss, rushed into the parking lot.
0:44:29|0:44:34|[Li Cangdong] ran all the way to the other side after confirming that he had entered.
0:44:34|0:44:40|In the elevator leading to the parking lot, a long-haired beauty pressed the button, and [Hua Tian] walked in.
0:44:40|0:44:44|He frowned, standing behind the beauty and looking at the elevator door.
0:44:44|0:44:50|Shortly after, [Li Cangdong] quickly arrived at the exit of the parking lot, standing in a corner and looking around.
0:44:50|0:44:56|The taxi fleet quickly arrived, parking by the roadside and waiting for [Li Cangdong]'s orders.
0:44:57|0:45:5|At this moment, a car slowly drove out of the parking lot and stopped at the toll booth on the slope, catching the attention of [Li Cangdong], but he did not approach to intercept.
0:45:14|0:45:21|Later, [Li Cangdong] entered the parking lot and searched for [Hua Tian] based on the location, but instead he saw [Hua Tian]'s phone on the parking space.
0:45:21|0:45:29|On the other side, [Hua Tian] is using a public telephone.
0:45:31|0:45:37|Deafening gunshots rang out from under the elevated bridge in the outskirts, as two henchmen stood behind [Tai Ping], who was designated to collect money.
0:45:37|0:45:44|At this moment, [A Di] placed the rifle on the sack under [Tai Ping]'s feet, then picked up a pistol and walked towards He Xi Kui. But He Xi Kui looked at her seriously and said.
0:45:48|0:45:55|With a contemptuous smile, [A Di] walked straight to the side, while Xi Gui, who was standing still, looked at her in astonishment as she aimed the gun at the empty space.
0:45:58|0:46:4|After Tai Ping settled everything, the five of them split up. Tai Ping led two of his men back the way they came.
0:46:4|0:46:11|Xi Gui and [A Di] climbed up from under the bridge to the road surface. Then, [A Di] directly sat into the car parked by the roadside.
0:46:11|0:46:19|Xi Gui first opened the back door of the car, put the backpack full of guns inside, and then sat in the driver's seat before slowly starting the car.
0:46:26|0:46:32|Watching as [Xi Gui's Younger Sister]'s [A Di] smiled with relief. The praised [Xi Gui's Younger Sister] showed a long-lost smile.
0:46:33|0:46:41|Sitting close to the seat, [A Di] glanced at [Xi Gui's Younger Sister] who was driving. After a moment, she looked out the window at the scenery and said thoughtfully.
0:46:59|0:47:11|The broadcast in the car evoked emotions in [A Di]. Past experiences flashed before his eyes like the scenery outside the window.
0:47:12|0:47:19|Suddenly, Xi Gui's Younger Sister, He, had a flashback of him and his sister walking hand in hand on the street.
0:47:22|0:47:27|Empathetic [A Di] looked at him and said.
0:47:39|0:47:44|Expressionless [Xi Gui's Younger Sister] looked at [A Di] who longed to be cared for, feeling full of sympathy in her heart.
0:47:44|0:47:53|Following that, He [Xi Gui's Younger Sister] turned the car onto another street, only to unexpectedly encounter a police car inspection. The two of them looked at each other nervously.
0:47:53|0:48:2|Guided by the police, He [Xi Gui's Younger Sister] slowly pulled over the car to the side of the road and waited for inspection. At this moment, the two people sitting in the car were on pins and needles.
0:48:2|0:48:9|Meanwhile, Xi Gui's Younger Sister observed the passing vehicles through the rearview mirror. At the same time, a police officer slowly approached them.
0:48:9|0:48:17|And gestured for him to roll down the car window. Then, the police officer spoke to him with the half-opened window.
0:49:8|0:49:12|And as the police car behind was about to collide, it quickly turned the steering wheel and slammed on the brakes.
0:49:26|0:49:39|At this moment, Xi Gui, moving against the traffic, dodges the passing vehicles. Suddenly, a large truck blocks his path, so he quickly passes through the gap in front of the truck. However, as he crosses the road, he is hit to the side by a small car.
0:49:39|0:49:54|Shortly after, without any hesitation, he heard the sound of a police siren and immediately unbuckled his seatbelt. He leaned over to open the passenger door, then quickly got out of the car to pull out [A Di]. He then ran to the other side to grab a bag filled with firearms.
0:49:55|0:50:2|Suddenly, he saw the police getting out of the car, so he grabbed [A Di] and ran.
0:50:4|0:50:10|They ran across the street towards the crowded side of the street, with a large number of police officers closely following behind, launching a pursuit.
0:50:10|0:50:17|Leading the pack, [Xi Gui] glanced back at [A Di] and saw her falling behind. She grabbed her and ran forward with all her might.
0:50:17|0:50:24|Suddenly, Xi Gui noticed that there were police officers ahead. He slowed down and pulled A Di to turn left onto the road.
0:50:24|0:50:30|A Di, completely confused, just kept following him. But they hadn't run far when they encountered the police ahead.
0:50:31|0:50:37|They then ran towards the nearby market, where goods were hanging everywhere in a messy manner.
0:50:40|0:50:47|He [Xi Gui] pulled [A Di] through the narrow aisle, using merchandise as cover to evade the police's sight.
0:50:49|0:50:53|Later, the police split into two groups, carefully searching for Xi Gui and A Di who might be hiding in different corners.
0:50:56|0:51:9|At the same time, the two who were looking for an exit saw the police ahead. They quickly turned around and ran towards another corridor, but they were intercepted not far away. Thinking quickly, [Xi Gui] pulled [A Di] into a nearby shop to hide.
0:51:9|0:51:20|At this moment, [Xi Gui] held his breath, listening carefully to the sounds outside, while [A Di], with blood at the corner of his mouth, stared intently at the police outside through the gap in the hanging clothes.
0:51:20|0:51:25|Seeing the police walking away, the two immediately turned around and started walking back, but halfway through they spotted the police.
0:51:25|0:51:32|Xi Gui hesitated for a moment, then retreated without hesitation, looking for another way out. But just as he was about to run, police suddenly appeared in front of him.
0:51:33|0:51:40|The two quickly pressed against the wall covered with clothes, but the police on both sides approached the location where the two were at the same time.
0:51:58|0:52:7|At this moment, under the dim light, he exuded masculine hormones. When he turned his head to look at [A Di], [A Di] couldn't help but kiss him.
0:52:7|0:52:15|He was at a loss and instantly froze, but [A Di] bit his lower lip again, enveloping the two in an ambiguous atmosphere.
0:52:51|0:52:58|Li Cangdong, standing still, points at him. Suddenly, Tai Ping appears in the residential building.
0:52:58|0:53:6|With a furrowed brow, he watched as incense was lit at the entrance of a house. Just then, Xi Gui's phone rang.
0:53:13|0:53:17|Looking at the door, [Xi Gui] hung up the phone and turned to [Li Cangdong].
0:53:18|0:53:23|The knocking on the door sounded again, and [Li Cangdong], with a blank expression, grabbed his handbag and walked towards the house.
0:53:24|0:53:34|Shortly after, Xi Gui, who quickly adjusted his state, arrived at the door and opened it unhurriedly. Outside the door, Tai Ping, leaning against the door frame, glanced at him and then walked towards the house.
0:53:35|0:53:43|Cautious Xi Gui calmly closed the door, then, with an uneasy heart, he turned around and walked towards Tai Ping, who was looking around.
0:53:43|0:53:48|Next, [Tai Ping] put his arm around his shoulder, and the two of them walked and talked.
0:53:51|0:53:58|Saying that, [Tai Ping] casually opened the door next to him, and [Li Cangdong] hiding in the room immediately ducked behind the door.
0:54:4|0:54:11|Next, the two of them walked to the balcony, with [Tai Ping] carefully inspecting every corner of the balcony, while [Xi Gui] went back inside and lit a cigarette.
0:54:13|0:54:19|Tai Ping looked at Xi Gui seriously, while Xi Gui pretended to be calm as he took out a cigarette and said.
0:54:25|0:54:30|After speaking, [Tai Ping] turned around and opened the door, while [Li Cangdong], who was hiding in the room, took the opportunity to sneak towards the balcony.
0:54:31|0:54:38|Upon hearing the noise, [Tai Ping] immediately turned around, glanced at [Xi Gui] behind him, and then walked past him towards the room to check behind the door.
0:54:38|0:54:51|Shortly after, [Tai Ping] walked to the door, pointing at the door next to him. Xi Gui, who was smoking with his head down, immediately looked up and hesitated for a moment before speaking to him. Then, [Tai Ping] waved to Xi Gui, signaling him to come over.
0:54:51|0:54:55|Next, [Tai Ping] put his arm around him and walked towards the door of the next room.
0:54:56|0:55:4|At the same time, hiding on the balcony, [Li Cangdong] secretly looked towards the living room. Seeing no sign of the two people, he immediately opened the balcony window and climbed out.
0:55:5|0:55:10|Tai Ping rang the bell but no one answered, so he used his hand to knock on the door.
0:55:10|0:55:14|Suddenly, the door was opened, and the nervous [Xi Gui] became tense in an instant.
0:55:14|0:55:25|The old lady speaking in dialect gestured excitedly, and at that moment, [Li Cangdong] walked towards the door while eating something, and pushed the old lady aside to stand in front of the two.
0:55:52|0:55:57|He [Xi Gui] pretended to remain calm, while [Tai Ping], with a furrowed brow, left directly.
0:55:57|0:56:2|In the house, [Li Cangdong] took out a few hundred yuan from his wallet and stuffed it into his mother-in-law's hand.
0:56:4|0:56:11|At night, the neon lights on the street were colorful, constantly shining their brilliance. The stalls on the side of the street added a touch of vitality to the city.
0:56:11|0:56:16|And behind the stall, the disheveled [Fei Weng] was walking and eating a boxed meal.
0:56:16|0:56:24|Suddenly, he saw a beauty walking out of the opposite store. So, he stood in the corner eating his boxed meal, but his eyes were fixed on the beauty the whole time.
0:56:25|0:56:31|At this moment, the beauty across from him suddenly looked up at him, but he immediately turned his head to avoid her gaze.
0:56:31|0:56:40|He then saw a car parked not far away, and when he recognized that it was [A Xue] approaching, he got so scared that he knocked over the lunch box, and then quickly hid in a corner.
0:56:51|0:57:2|Shortly after, [Li Cangdong] appeared under the bridge, holding a box. As he walked towards the house made of cardboard boxes, he looked around. Just as he was about to stick his head inside, a metallic sound came from the pitch-black paper house.
0:57:2|0:57:12|Suddenly, a short knife stabbed towards him, and [Li Cangdong] quickly grabbed the hand. [Li Cangdong] took the knife.
0:57:43|0:57:50|He then picked up the photo in his hand and carefully observed the woman singing on it. Meanwhile, inside the studio.
0:57:50|0:57:58|[Li Cangdong] and his boss stand in front of a wall full of photos.
0:58:4|0:58:10|He then turned and walked towards the table where the phone was placed. He picked up the phone, pressed the answer button, and held it to his ear, saying.
0:58:14|0:58:20|Later, Li Cangdong, who was driving, slowly lifted his head and looked at Fei Weng lying in the back seat through the rearview mirror.
0:58:35|0:58:48|Suddenly, a rolling door slowly rises from inside, and a man walks out. He cautiously looks around before heading towards a side street. At this moment, [Li Cangdong], who has parked his car not far away, is sitting in the car watching everything.
0:58:48|0:58:54|The man, pretending to be nonchalant, walked to the corner and suddenly found a person lying on the ground.
0:58:54|0:59:1|The man was surrounded by scattered bottles of alcohol. After making sure the drunk people around him were not causing any trouble, he waved towards the depths of the alley.
0:59:1|0:59:7|Before long, a sedan drove out of the alley, slowly moving forward under the man's guidance.
0:59:7|0:59:10|Next, it stopped by the road in front of the rolling shutter door.
0:59:10|0:59:18|At the same time, a man knocked on the rolling door, and [A Gou] walked out from inside.
0:59:37|0:59:43|The police forcefully pulled [A Gou] out of the back seat of the sedan, pressed him hard against the rolling shutter door, and handcuffed him with cold handcuffs.
0:59:49|0:59:53|Tears welled up in his eyes, a mix of emotions overwhelming him, and his furrowed brow gradually relaxed.
1:0:28|1:0:36|At this moment, [Li Cangdong] was overwhelmed with emotions, finally letting go of the grudges that had been building up in his heart for years.
1:1:54|1:2:0|He pointed outside and said with a smile. The beauty was slightly embarrassed by the sudden inquiry from [Li Cangdong].
1:2:19|1:2:25|At this moment, [Li Cangdong]'s smile on his face began to stiffen, but he looked gently at the beautiful woman and said.
1:2:58|1:3:8|On the other side, [Li Cangdong], who was dancing in the studio, stopped and sat down weakly on the edge of the bed, hiding himself in the darkness. At this moment, he looked like a naughty child who had done something wrong, with his head lowered between his shoulders. [Li Cangdong] sat across from the [doctor].
1:3:25|1:3:40|At this moment, [Li Cangdong], hiding in the corner, looks ahead. The person he loves the most is holding someone else's arm. Beside them, there is the father of his ex-wife. The two are standing in front of a small shop, chatting and laughing. Then, a man with glasses walks towards the old man with a drink in his hand. The man with glasses turns around with a puzzled look on his face.
1:3:59|1:4:5|The old man, expressionless, let out a deep sigh and shook his head.
1:4:7|1:4:13|After speaking, the two of them slowly lowered their heads. In the studio on the other side, [Li Cangdong] looked at [Li Cangdong's Boss] who was smoking beside him.
1:4:14|1:4:24|Li Cangdong's Boss took a deep drag on his cigar and said.
1:4:37|1:4:42|At this moment, [Li Cangdong] furrowed his brow, looking at the determined gaze of [Li Cangdong's Boss], and eventually compromised.
1:4:56|1:5:6|In the pitch-black night, outside the dark residential building, a gloomy and silent atmosphere pervades. As [Li Cangdong] sleeps soundly, his body gradually curls up into a ball, cold sweat beading on his forehead.
1:5:32|1:5:43|At the same time, images appeared in [Li Cangdong]'s mind, showing his informant trapped in the middle of an iron gate. Despite the informant's desperate plea for help, he did not appear by the informant's side.
1:5:43|1:5:48|Feeling guilty, [Li Cangdong] sat on the edge of the bed.
1:6:9|1:6:15|The last conversation with the informant kept echoing in his ears, and he gradually disappeared into the darkness, torn between conflicting feelings.
1:6:15|1:6:23|He then appeared on the street driving a car, with no one around at that moment, the lights from the nearby shops shining on him.
1:6:23|1:6:32|Next, he picked up his phone, dialed a number, and waited for someone to answer on the other end.
1:6:42|1:6:47|And Xi Gui, who is in the residential building, leans against the wall, staring blankly outside the window.
1:6:50|1:6:54|After speaking, he immediately hung up the phone, not giving the other party any chance to speculate on his emotions.
1:6:54|1:7:4|On the other side, [Li Cangdong], still feeling lingering fear, looked out the window, then lowered his head to turn off his phone. He picked up the briefcase on the passenger seat, opened the car door, and got out.
1:7:4|1:7:17|As he walked straight towards the shop across the street, his former father-in-law happened to pass by. The father-in-law stood in place, carefully observing his figure. After confirming it was him, he angrily walked towards him.
1:7:19|1:7:35|Shortly after, as he sat on a bench outside the lounge preparing to change his shoes, his father-in-law happened to walk by. The father-in-law looked around searching for his figure, and upon seeing him, quickly ran up to him.
1:7:37|1:7:50|The father-in-law picked up the trophy and smashed it towards his head. In an instant, [Li Cangdong]'s head was covered in blood. He covered the wound with his hand, but his body slowly slid to the ground, while the father-in-law stared with wide eyes at his daughter standing at the door.
1:7:50|1:7:58|The daughter who witnessed all this with her own eyes couldn't help but shed tears as she looked at [Li Cangdong], whose face was covered in blood, and in disbelief, she turned and ran out.
1:7:58|1:8:4|Father-in-law immediately chased out, [Li Cangdong] who fell to the ground struggled to get up despite the pain.
1:8:4|1:8:8|When he chased out, what he saw were the marks of emergency braking.
1:8:8|1:8:14|When the woman had just run out of the door, a black sedan suddenly drove out and hit her out.
1:8:14|1:8:19|Following closely behind, [A Xue's Father] watched as his daughter was hit by a car and immediately fainted to the ground.
1:8:20|1:8:30|[Li Cangdong's Boss] rushed over from the car and, upon seeing the woman lying on the ground, he immediately ran up and fell to his knees in front of her in a daze. He sensibly took out his phone and dialed the emergency number for help.
1:8:45|1:8:48|After speaking, he immediately turned and ran towards the woman lying on the ground.
1:8:48|1:8:53|After seeing the woman's thin blouse, he unhesitatingly took off his jacket and covered it over the woman.
1:8:53|1:9:4|He then anxiously looked at the motionless woman lying on the ground, filled with self-blame and guilt. In a state of great urgency, he bent down and kissed the woman's cheek.
1:9:11|1:9:19|He then moved his hands away from the woman's body, holding them up in the air. At the same time, he furrowed his brow and kept shaking his head, which was bleeding profusely.
1:9:21|1:9:24|He covered his face, which was covered in blood, with his hands, unable to stop crying.
1:9:24|1:9:32|He slowly lifted his head to look at the woman. In despair, he kept shaking his head.
1:9:32|1:9:41|Having experienced despair once before, he allowed this tragedy to happen to himself again, so he leaned in close to the woman's ear.
1:9:56|1:10:3|Before long, the ambulance transported all the injured individuals to the hospital. Outside the operating room, two people were sitting.
1:10:3|1:10:10|Li Cangdong's father-in-law had bandages on his head, looking up at the ceiling, while sitting next to him was a man who was having an affair with a woman.
1:10:10|1:10:18|On the other side, [Li Cangdong], with bandages on his head, sat expressionless in the car, his brows furrowed tightly as he stared ahead intently.
1:10:19|1:10:24|The next day, various noisy sounds could be heard on the bustling streets.
1:10:27|1:10:38|Shortly after, a taxi stopped at the intersection, and not far away, another taxi also stopped. Then, [Ma Da] and [Bao Zhu] looked around and quickly walked towards the alley.
1:10:38|1:10:44|They arrived at the zipper that had been waiting here for a long time, and at the same time, Tai Ping walked out from another alley.
1:10:44|1:10:48|The four characters gathered together and looked towards the approaching car.
1:11:8|1:11:14|Sitting in the back row, [Ma Da] took the bag handed by [Tai Ping] and proceeded to remove the batteries from everyone's phones.
1:11:15|1:11:19|At this moment, everyone in the car has put on white gloves.
1:11:19|1:11:24|Sitting in the passenger seat, [Tai Ping] occasionally glanced at the situation behind the car through the rearview mirror.
1:11:24|1:11:34|Shortly after, [Tai Ping], who withdrew his gaze, noticed the traffic jam on the bridge ahead. Frowning, he rested his arm on the car window and stared fixedly at the vehicles in front.
1:11:35|1:11:41|Xi Gui, closely followed by Li Cangdong, slowly parked the car on the road, while Tai Ping impatiently glanced at the rearview mirror and said.
1:12:0|1:12:8|The car door was opened from the inside by [Tai Ping], who grabbed the woman by her hair and dragged her out of the car. Then, everyone quickly got into the car.
1:12:13|1:12:20|Night fell quickly, with five henchmen scattered outside the room waiting, while Xi Gui sat on the eaves smoking a cigarette.
1:12:34|1:12:36|After speaking, [A Di] stood up and walked towards the refrigerator.
1:12:36|1:12:44|And the frowning [Hua Tian] followed closely behind, asking.
1:12:47|1:12:52|At this moment, [Hua Tian]'s phone suddenly rang, while [A Di] leaned against the refrigerator and smoked heavily.
1:12:52|1:13:0|[Hua Tian] took out his phone and hung up directly, placing it on the table. [A Di] looked at the phone with a wry smile on his face and said.
1:13:2|1:13:6|She then turned around with a look of disdain on her face, walked towards the table, and put down the beer in her hand.
1:13:6|1:13:14|At the same time, [Hua Tian]'s phone rang again. She sat on a chair next to the table, smoking and looking at [Hua Tian].
1:13:14|1:13:21|Shortly after, [Hua Tian] picked up her phone, looked at it, and pressed the answer button, holding it to her ear. Then, [Hua Tian]'s eyes wandered aimlessly.
1:13:23|1:13:30|At this moment, [A Di] was consumed by jealousy, her hand shaking as she smoked. She stood up and snatched [Hua Tian]'s phone, throwing it to the ground.
1:13:38|1:13:44|After speaking, [Hua Tian] stormed out, while the humiliated [A Di] kicked the bed frame aside and took a deep drag of a cigarette.
1:13:46|1:13:54|In the corridor, the calm and cool [Hua Tian] walks while smoking a cigarette, and silently takes the cigarette box handed to him by [Tai Ping] who is following behind.
1:14:5|1:14:10|Tai Ping, smoking, looked at Hua Tian in shock. On the other side, He Xi Kui stood by the balcony watching.
1:14:10|1:14:33|A sanitation worker downstairs is cleaning the street. He then places his beer on the ground and sits on the steps nearby. Soon after, he takes out his hand from his pocket, glances behind him, and starts writing on the money, "Please notify." But just as he is about to continue writing, he suddenly hears a noise behind him. Cautiously, he puts away the money and pen, then turns to look behind him.
1:14:33|1:14:41|He saw [A Di] sitting alone on the steps holding his stomach, then he walked towards [A Di] with a cup of water.
1:14:42|1:14:50|[A Di] looked up at the man in front of her. Seeing that Xi Gui had not taken the water glass from him, He Xikui picked up her hand and placed it on the glass.
1:14:50|1:14:54|Watching the water in his hand, [A Di] grits his teeth and takes a sip despite the pain.
1:14:54|1:14:58|When she was at her loneliest, it was the man in front of her who gave her warmth.
1:14:58|1:15:4|She then stopped sobbing, slowly lifted her head and looked at Xi Gui.
1:15:7|1:15:10|Xi Gui, looking at Tai Ping, shifted his gaze to A Di.
1:15:10|1:15:17|The two of them looked at each other silently. After a moment, everyone returned to the room. [A Di] leaned against the cabinet, drinking beer.
1:15:17|1:15:20|The remaining five people stood around the table in the middle.
1:15:52|1:16:1|The zipper on the table, with hands resting on it, slowly moved back as footsteps approached. At that moment, [Ma Da] suddenly rushed forward, grabbed his collar, and knocked his head against the table.
1:16:1|1:16:11|[Bao Zhu] pulled his legs from behind, causing him to fall to the ground with [Xi Gui], who stood by watching in shock, while Tai Ping stood beside him, frowning deeply.
1:16:11|1:16:22|Just as Xi Gui shifted his gaze away, he unintentionally met eyes with Hua Tian. Feeling guilty, he was at a loss, but in order to avoid suspicion from Hua Tian, he still participated in the battle.
1:16:22|1:16:32|So, Xi Gui held down his legs that were struggling against the zipper, while Bao Zhu rode on top of the zipper and choked him, and Ma Da kept locking his head with his arms.
1:16:32|1:16:43|Suddenly, the strong and muscular Fei Weng flipped Bao Zhu to the ground, grabbed Ma Da's hair and pulled him away. At this moment, Bao Zhu got up and picked up a belt from the side, putting it over the head of the zipper.
1:16:43|1:16:50|However, he mounted [Xi Gui] again, tightened the belt with all his might, and the three of them worked together to gradually silence the zipper.
1:16:50|1:16:57|Hua Tian slowly walked to the front of the zipper, looking satisfied at the zipper that was no longer resisting.
1:16:58|1:17:5|With his eyes closed, [A Di] furrowed his brow, and when he opened them, he saw [Bao Zhu] and [Ma Da] carrying the zipper out.
1:17:15|1:17:24|Tai Ping sees Hua Tian walking out the door and looks towards Xi Gui. The next day, the bustling streets are crowded with people.
1:17:24|1:17:37|[Ma Da] leisurely walked along the street, looking around. Inside the jewelry store across the street, each display had a salesperson ready to greet customers. Meanwhile, various people were walking on the street outside.
1:17:37|1:17:45|On the other side, Jing Xinjin Jewelry Store pulled down the rolling shutter to check the goods. At this moment, outside, [Hua Tian] walked by and glanced inside.
1:17:45|1:18:0|In the alley, [Tai Ping] walked out aggressively with [Bao Zhu] and [Ma Da], while He Xikui, sitting in the car, stared intently at Tai Ping standing at the intersection. At that moment, He Xikui suddenly saw through the rearview mirror a person cleaning a car slowly approaching him from behind.
1:18:1|1:18:3|So he came up with a bold idea.
1:18:3|1:18:12|He first looked at Tai Ping standing still, then lowered his head to write something on his hand with a pen, while Bao Zhu and Ma Da had already met up with Hua Tian.
1:18:12|1:18:20|Three people successively took out the masks from their pockets. Then, the car washer lightly tapped on He Xikui's car window, feeling anxious and uneasy, he looked towards [Tai Ping]'s direction.
1:18:20|1:18:30|He then reached out to the glass window, with a message written in his palm, informing [Li Cangdong] at 66880693, that there was a robbery at Queen's Road East, King's Road.
1:18:31|1:18:36|Suddenly, [Tai Ping] turned his head and cleverly shook the hand in front of the glass window.
1:18:36|1:18:44|Shortly after, [Hua Tian] in front of the Jingxin Gold Shop nodded to [Tai Ping]. Upon receiving the signal, [Tai Ping] immediately waved to He Xi Kui not far away.
1:18:45|1:18:50|On the other side, Li Cangdong's phone rang.
1:18:53|1:18:57|In front of the Golden Gate, [Tai Ping] is holding a gun to stop passing vehicles on the street.
1:18:57|1:19:5|Xi Gui swiftly drove the car out of the alley and skillfully reversed it into the jewelry store. In an instant, the alarm system inside the store started blaring.
1:19:5|1:19:10|Amid the panic of the people around him, Xi Gui drove the car out of the gold shop and parked it at the entrance.
1:19:10|1:19:21|And waiting in front of the door were [Bao Zhu], [Ma Da], and [Hua Tian], who walked in through the broken rolling door one after another.
1:19:43|1:19:51|The clerk squatted down, trembling as she slowly opened the safe. She pulled open the door of the safe, revealing the stack of gold bars inside.
1:19:51|1:19:53|When [Hua Tian] saw so many gold bars, he was also stunned.
1:19:55|1:20:0|In the lobby of the jewelry store, Xi Gui suddenly saw a phone left on the ground.
1:20:8|1:20:16|Shortly after, [Ma Da] dragged a heavy bag outside. As they put the bag filled with gold and silver treasures into the trunk, the car involuntarily shook.
1:20:17|1:20:21|On both sides of the street, a large number of police officers were rushing towards the jewelry store.
1:20:23|1:20:26|The police officer pressed against the wall, slowly moving forward step by step.
1:20:26|1:20:32|Just as everyone's attention was focused on [Tai Ping] by the roadside, [Xi Gui] suddenly walked out from the shop.
1:20:32|1:20:35|He looked at the police officer beside him in confusion.
1:20:35|1:20:43|[Hua Tian] behind him fired the gun first, and at this moment, [Tai Ping] was attracted by the gunshot, walking towards the police while shooting.
1:20:44|1:20:51|Due to the lack of cover, the police quickly retreated into the nearby store, while Xi Gui and the others quickly got into the car under the cover of Tai Ping and drove away.
1:21:0|1:21:9|On the other side, [A Di] opened an iron gate from the inside, where [Hua Tian] and others were waiting outside. Driving, [Xi Gui] slowly drove the car into the warehouse.
1:21:9|1:21:15|After the car was completely inside, [A Di] quietly closed the door, leaving only the sunlight shining into the dark warehouse.
1:21:16|1:21:23|Shortly after, several people got off the car almost simultaneously. At this moment, [Tai Ping] stood in front of the car and spoke.
1:21:30|1:21:38|As soon as the words fell, Xi Gui and Bao Zhu handed the pistols to Tai Ping one after another. A Di stood behind the car with bandages on his face, watching everything intently.
1:21:38|1:21:42|The group of people quickly took action to destroy the evidence.
1:21:42|1:21:49|Xi Gui secretly dialed a phone number and even stuffed the phone into a crack in the wall, Li Cangdong picked up the phone.
1:21:53|1:21:56|Everything was proceeding in an orderly manner under the arrangement of [Hua Tian].
1:21:56|1:22:2|On the street, [Li Cangdong] took out another phone and dialed a number, whispering.
1:22:6|1:22:15|On the other side, [A Di] prepared a homemade Molotov cocktail, placed it on the car roof, leaned in to the car, picked up her handgun, then took out a lighter from her pocket and skillfully lit the Molotov cocktail.
1:22:17|1:22:26|A Molotov cocktail was thrown into the car, causing a blaze in the back seat. Not far away, a flamethrower was spewing flames to melt gold, and [Ma Da] was extremely excited watching the gold.
1:22:27|1:22:29|He laughed wildly while wearing sunglasses.
1:22:29|1:22:35|Xi Gui walked over at this moment, wiped the sweat off his face, and the gold on the furnace had also been refined almost perfectly.
1:22:35|1:22:43|Bao Zhu placed it in a basin to cool. A Di poured out the re-solidified gold bars from the rough mold and weighed them on an electronic scale.
1:22:44|1:22:52|The whole team worked like an assembly line, producing gold bars without any marks. [Tai Ping] with protective goggles answered the phone.
1:23:6|1:23:16|[A Di] disdainfully glanced at the gold bar, so [Hua Tian] added another one.
1:23:17|1:23:23|And this time, [A Di] didn't even lift his head, not even looking at him, [Hua Tian] didn't say much either, turned around and left.
1:23:23|1:23:29|After Hua Tian walked a distance, A Di finally turned around and glanced sideways at Hua Tian's back.
1:23:30|1:23:35|Next, [A Di] aimed his gun at [Hua Tian], pulling the trigger and hitting him in the shoulder.
1:23:35|1:23:42|The tall [Bao Zhu] suddenly dragged He Xi Kui over, leaving him feeling helpless amidst the unexpected internal conflict.
1:23:42|1:23:49|Piles of gold bars were all stuffed into the backpack by [Bao Zhu], while [Ma Da] and [Tai Ping] stood dumbfounded on the side without daring to speak.
1:23:49|1:23:53|Bao Zhu stuffed bags filled with gold bars into the trunk of the car.
1:23:54|1:24:3|[Hua Tian], clutching his wound and gritting his teeth, faced [A Di]'s gun but dared not move forward. [Bao Zhu], with the gold bars in place, stepped forward and gestured an OK sign to [A Di].
1:24:3|1:24:11|He then pushed [Ma Da] aside and took the gold bars on the table behind him. At that moment, he was suddenly drenched in liquid gold.
1:24:21|1:24:26|[Tai Ping] and [Ma Da] immediately picked up the nearby pistols and started shooting at them, [Hua Tian] and the others had no intention of letting them go.
1:24:27|1:24:32|[A Di] was the first to turn around and shoot, hitting [Tai Ping]. He then grabbed her and ran towards the car.
1:24:32|1:24:42|[Hua Tian] arrived and raised his gun to shoot, while [A Di] and Xi Gui could only crouch in front of the car. Meanwhile, the fire on [Bao Zhu], who was ignored, grew stronger and eventually ignited the liquefied gas.
1:24:45|1:24:52|A huge explosion engulfed in smoke and dust from all directions, [A Di] took the opportunity to reach into the trunk and pull out a bundle of gold bars.
1:24:54|1:25:2|Hua Tian in the corner fired several shots but failed to hit the target, while Xi Gui stepped forward to shield A Di. Hua Tian in the corner shouted.
1:25:4|1:25:9|He Xi Kui peered out and saw [Ma Da] and his men slowly approaching with guns in hand.
1:25:9|1:25:14|The firelight reflected on everyone's faces. [Hua Tian] and [Tai Ping] cautiously moved forward with their guns raised.
1:25:16|1:25:24|The warehouse door was suddenly blown open, followed by the SWAT team in standard gear rushing in, causing the criminals to tense up immediately.
1:25:27|1:25:34|At this moment, [Tai Ping] said, "Whether it's gold bars or grudges, as long as the green hills remain, there will be no shortage of firewood." [Hua Tian] slung his backpack over his shoulder and walked out first.
1:25:34|1:25:44|Tai Ping and Ma Da destroyed the evidence, throwing the pistol into the fire pit. Then they moved a steel plate aside, revealing an underground passage, with [Tai Ping] leading the way in.
1:25:44|1:25:51|[A Di] is covering the wounded Xi Gui, and the two are hiding behind an empty oil drum. [A Di] looks towards the SWAT team outside.
1:25:51|1:25:55|The special police team rushed in with flashlights and submachine guns.
1:25:55|1:26:6|[A Di] took the initiative, and the special police immediately fought back. The sound of gunfire became more and more intense. He Xikui was unwilling to be caught and removed the wooden board in the corner of the wall, unexpectedly leading to the outside. At the same time,
1:26:6|1:26:11|[Hua Tian], who was shot, was carrying a large bag of gold bars, limping hurriedly forward.
1:26:11|1:26:19|Not long after, a wooden board on the corner window was removed by Xi Gui, creating a passable hole. Xi Gui, panting heavily, grabbed A Di's hand and greeted him.
1:26:19|1:26:28|He first threw the gold bars out of the window, then climbed out himself. [A Di] kept a close eye on the special police. Meanwhile, [Hua Tian], who had escaped from the warehouse, was losing strength due to being shot.
1:26:28|1:26:35|The big bag of gold bars became too heavy to carry, so he used all his wits to get to the port. Before boarding the ship, he saw the special police patrol boat.
1:26:35|1:26:41|At that moment, he hesitated. The special police team that maintained formation in the warehouse also approached.
1:26:41|1:26:48|Alone at the port, [Hua Tian] faced the fully armed special police, dropped his bag, raised his hands, and slowly knelt down.
1:26:49|1:26:55|The special police officers ran up and successfully subdued him, and the cold handcuffs finally fell on his wrists.
1:26:55|1:27:2|[Hua Tian] looked pained, but had no choice. Afterwards, the superior expressed dissatisfaction.
1:28:8|1:28:13|Li Cangdong, who was caught in the middle, was particularly heartbroken and couldn't understand his boss's behavior.
1:28:14|1:28:25|After the boss finished speaking, [Li Cangdong] was left standing in place, his expression filled with extreme pain. He hunched over, furrowing his brow, feeling as if a heavy stone was pressing down on his chest, making it difficult for him to breathe.
1:28:25|1:28:38|However, the escaped [A Di] and Xi Gui are currently hiding in a dimly lit basement. The walls of the room are particularly mottled, with only a bed and a set of table and chairs inside. Xi Gui is lying on the bed, seemingly unconscious.
1:28:38|1:28:44|[A Di] is helping him clean the wound. The intense pain makes his pale lips tremble uncontrollably.
1:28:44|1:28:49|After cleaning the wound, [A Di] wrapped it with gauze. Thunder rumbled in the sky at this moment.
1:28:51|1:28:58|In a corner of the bustling city streets, a car is parked, and the person inside is the harried [Li Cangdong].
1:28:58|1:29:4|He reclined the driver's seat and lay there with his eyes closed, just then, a taxi pulled up beside him.
1:29:4|1:29:13|The person in the car got out and walked straight towards the hospital building. [Li Cangdong] in the car immediately became alert, he got out of the car and looked towards the hospital entrance.
1:29:13|1:29:25|He then closed the car door and took two steps forward, muttering to himself as he looked across the street at the hospital entrance. Unfortunately, things did not go as planned.
1:29:25|1:29:35|The man who walked out from the transparent glass door had an expression of extreme pain. He stood quietly at the doorway as if his feet were frozen, but his features were twisted in sadness.
1:29:35|1:29:50|He looked up and saw [Li Cangdong], immediately covering his forehead and crying. [Li Cangdong]'s ex-wife died despite the rescue efforts, and how could he across the street not understand this scene? He just frowned, turned around, and slowly walked towards the car.
1:29:50|1:30:2|The car was speeding on the highway, [Li Cangdong] under the black-framed glasses was filled with indescribable sadness, tears slid from the corners of his eyes to his cheeks, he tightly clenched his mouth to prevent any sound from escaping.
1:30:2|1:30:10|He knew better than anyone else that all of this was his own fault. Hot tears welled up in his eyes, and then suddenly his gaze became resolute.
1:30:10|1:30:26|With one hand on the steering wheel, he unbuckled his seatbelt. Then, both hands left the wheel, raised in surrender. The car crashed fiercely into the stone pillar on the side of the road, with shattered windshield and raised hood, expressing the pain in Li Cangdong's heart.
1:30:26|1:30:32|The steering wheel on the outside, the deformed seat, and the misshapen airbag envelop [Li Cangdong].
1:30:32|1:30:56|Smoke or steam was billowing out from under the hood, and inside the car, [Li Cangdong] lay sprawled, his face covered in shards of glass. In the midst of danger, he exerted all his strength to slowly lift his head, desperately trying to sit up from the collapsed body in the seat. Propping his elbow against his waist, he finally managed to sit up. This was his punishment to himself. Leaning against the seat, he furrowed his brow, squinting as he looked ahead.
1:30:56|1:31:4|A suicide-style car crash failed to end his life, the death of his ex-wife and the informant's dilemma are both tormenting his heart at this moment.
1:31:5|1:31:17|Perhaps it was the will of heaven to leave him in the world to complete his unfinished task. Tears rolled down from the corners of his eyes, and his glasses had long been knocked off to an unknown location. Just then, a phone call suddenly came in.
1:31:24|1:31:30|The body, filled with pain, could hardly move, and the heart, riddled with wounds, couldn't muster any enthusiasm.
1:31:31|1:31:44|The phone kept ringing incessantly, and he had no choice but to answer the call. He put the phone to his ear. [Xi Gui] endured the pain in his body.
1:31:46|1:31:55|He held onto the wound on his waist. Inside the house, [Xi Gui] looked around and caught sight of the doorplate in the corner, stating the address.
1:31:57|1:32:13|After hanging up the phone, he struggled to crawl to the bed with his injured body. The wound on his waist was occasionally pulled, almost causing him to kneel on the bed. Fortunately, [A Di] returned in time and hurried forward.
1:32:14|1:32:19|She helped [Xi Gui], whose body felt heavy, climb onto the bed with great effort.
1:32:19|1:32:27|Xi Gui's forehead was unknowingly covered with a thin layer of sweat, his eyes showing a hint of distraction. A Di helped him up and sat him down.
1:32:28|1:32:46|[Xi Gui] tremblingly took out a ring from his pocket, slowly raising it up to show [A Di]. [A Di] looked at the blood-stained palm, eyes widening in disbelief, unable to speak for a moment. How could she have expected that [Xi Gui] had actually helped her retrieve this ring.
1:32:46|1:32:53|[Xi Gui] watched her struggling to catch her breath, and after adjusting her breathing, she revealed the truth to her.
1:32:57|1:33:4|A Di stared at him in astonishment.
1:33:4|1:33:11|At this moment, [A Di] looked at him with full of sympathy.
1:33:14|1:33:20|A Di calmed down his emotions, slowly lifted his head, and looked firmly at Xi Gui, saying.
1:33:24|1:33:30|Xi Gui's lips trembled as he stared at her.
1:33:38|1:33:52|The stubborn A Di, with tears welling up in his eyes, was holding back his tears. [Xi Gui] trembled as she touched A Di's cheek with her shaking hands, then her hand dropped down. A Di knelt on the bed, supporting [Xi Gui].
1:33:55|1:34:0|A Di worked hard to help Xi Gui turn over, letting him lie on his side on the bed.
1:34:1|1:34:9|Next, he pulled up the quilt and covered him, while [Xi Gui] lay on his side, tears rolling down his pillow without anyone noticing.
1:34:9|1:34:18|Later, he slowly closed his eyes. That night, many people found it hard to fall asleep, as a table lamp illuminated a corner of the living room.
1:34:18|1:34:22|Under the light, [Li Cangdong] sat there with bandages on his head.
1:34:22|1:34:30|The shards of glass on his face have been cleaned up, but the fresh blood on the wound is still shocking, he seems to have made a decision.
1:34:30|1:34:42|In front of the safe, he took out a key and turned the lock, then pressed numbers on the keypad. With a beep sound, the safe was opened, revealing stacks of cash inside.
1:34:42|1:34:47|[Li Cangdong] took out a prepared document bag and stuffed stacks of cash into it.
1:34:47|1:34:53|He wants to atone for his life. Early that day, the remote village was filled with the sound of birds chirping.
1:34:53|1:34:57|A ray of morning light streamed in through the window, falling onto the metal bunk bed.
1:34:57|1:35:1|Sitting on the chair beside the bed is [A Di], who seems to have been keeping watch all night.
1:35:1|1:35:9|Watching Xi Gui curl up in pain, she got up unhappily and went to the phone, impatiently dialing the doctor's number.
1:35:9|1:35:17|She eagerly pressed the receiver to her ear, trying hard to calm her breathing.
1:35:20|1:35:25|At the village entrance, not only did the [Doctor] come, but he was not alone.
1:35:26|1:35:30|Tai Ping takes out a stack of cash from his pocket and hands it to the doctor.
1:35:30|1:35:37|The two of them, unaware, were still waiting for treatment in the compartment, while Tai Ping and others had quietly approached.
1:35:37|1:35:43|About six or seven people quickly entered the urban village, led by [Tai Ping] who looked at the house numbers and walked briskly.
1:35:44|1:35:49|The old alleyways resemble slums, with some narrow paths only allowing one person to pass through at a time.
1:35:49|1:35:55|But it did not stop [Tai Ping] in the slightest. Compared to a heavy bag of gold bars, this difficulty is nothing.
1:35:56|1:35:59|The house was soon found.
1:35:59|1:36:6|As soon as there was a sound of someone unlocking the door, [A Di] sitting on the chair impatiently got up to open the door. However, what was opened from the outside was the security door.
1:36:6|1:36:17|[A Di] opened the small wooden door and shot through it, hitting the fat man outside who then fell to the ground.
1:36:17|1:36:22|With injuries on his body, Xi Gui finally climbed over the window but fell to the ground.
1:36:23|1:36:32|Outside the window is a narrow gap, Xi Gui struggles to move forward by leaning against the wall. A Di rushes over to help him, but due to the narrow aisle, he can only support him from behind.
1:36:32|1:36:36|The two quickly passed through the narrow alley and arrived at the crisscrossing small lanes.
1:36:36|1:36:47|The two panicked individuals could only run forward, with [Tai Ping] and the others in hot pursuit. However, when they turned into an alley, [A Di] accidentally fell down, and Xi Kui hurried to help her up.
1:36:47|1:36:53|In just a few seconds, [Tai Ping] had already rushed in, jumping up and swinging his knife with all his might, hitting Xi Gui's back.
1:36:53|1:37:5|[A Di] hurriedly helped Xi Gui up, but there was no way out in front of them. Just then, they heard an old woman's dog barking and the door opened. Without much thought, Xi Gui rushed straight into the old woman's house, with [A Di] following closely behind.
1:38:10|1:38:14|Xi Gui no longer sits idly by, he picks up a chair from the corridor and walks towards the gangsters.
1:38:14|1:38:23|Approaching quickly, he raised his hand and smashed down, while the bandits also brandished their machetes, attempting to seriously injure Xi Gui. Soon, the outnumbered Xi Gui was defeated.
1:38:23|1:38:34|He sat on the ground, propped up his body, hurriedly dodged backwards, and grabbed the nearby tables and chairs to block the robbers. [A Di] watched anxiously, desperately shaking the long-unused iron gate.
1:38:34|1:38:46|Finally, the door opened. The bandit crossed over the obstacles of tables and chairs, heading towards [Xi Gui]. In desperation, [Xi Gui] grabbed a wooden plank from the ground and smashed it towards the bandit. Just as the bandit was about to strike with his knife, [A Di] rushed in and picked up a sharp wooden plank.
1:38:46|1:38:53|Stabbed in the abdomen. On the other side, [Li Cangdong] who walked out of the house saw the blood on the ground, so he followed the blood and ran over.
1:38:53|1:39:4|Seeing the cowardly lackeys falling one by one, [Tai Ping] personally took up the machete and entered the fray. The two of them passed through the small door and pulled the latch behind them, while [Xi Gui] arrived at the back door intending to break it down, and [A Di] discovered that the gold bars were missing.
1:39:6|1:39:11|Impatient [A Di] crawled to the ground and reached towards the torn hole under the door to grab the backpack.
1:39:32|1:39:42|Xi Gui stuffed A Di in, but was viciously attacked from behind by Ma Da who had rushed over with a knife. Xi Gui seemed to be making a last-ditch effort, and kicked Ma Da down with a swift turn.
1:39:43|1:39:50|In the final moments, he still hoped that [A Di] could successfully escape. Furious, [Tai Ping] rushed over trying to pull out [Xi Gui].
1:39:50|1:40:1|But Xi Gui held onto the wooden door tightly for A Di, buying him time. Tai Ping swung his knife down, landing it on Xi Gui's head. A Di, heartbroken, stopped running and ran towards Xi Gui.
1:40:1|1:40:8|At this moment, [Li Cangdong] also ran over following the screams, and seeing [Ma Da] just getting up at the door, he rushed forward and pulled him down.
1:40:8|1:40:12|Xi Gui leaned against the door, his body involuntarily convulsing.
1:40:14|1:40:19|[Li Cangdong] threw [Ma Da] to the ground and smashed a chair on him, while [Tai Ping] entered the room and walked aggressively towards [A Di].
1:40:19|1:40:36|[Adi], who was retreating step by step, felt a piece of glass on the windowsill. Unexpectedly, [Tai Ping] was caught off guard and had his cheek slashed by the enraged [Adi]. [Adi] took advantage of the situation and stabbed [Tai Ping] several times in the stomach. As [Tai Ping] regained his senses, he smashed the glass with a knife, but the knife slipped from his hand.
1:40:36|1:40:40|In a classroom separated by a door, [Li Cangdong] was ambushed by [Ma Da] and fell to the ground.
1:40:40|1:40:50|[Ma Da] is riding on [Li Cangdong], waving his fists. [Li Cangdong] takes the opportunity to throw him off, then flips over and rides on top of [Ma Da], tightly gripping his neck with both hands.
1:40:50|1:41:0|[Ma Da] looked pained, his eyes bulging, yet his hand managed to find a brick on the ground. He then tightly gripped the brick and swung it, smashing it onto the unprepared head of [Li Cangdong].
1:41:0|1:41:8|Li Cangdong took the opportunity to catch his breath and lay on the ground, his hands not idle, finding a brick to smash on Ma Da's head.
1:41:8|1:41:15|[Li Cangdong] struggled to get up, shook his arms, and took another hit. In another room, [A Di] reached out to gouge [Tai Ping]'s eyeballs.
1:41:15|1:41:23|Tai Ping, in pain, grabbed A Di's injured arm. Ma Da outside the house had been hit on the head several times and had lost consciousness.
1:41:23|1:41:38|The weary Li Cangdong slowly and laboriously got up, only to see that the informant stuck in the door crack had long stopped moving. He hurried over and crouched by the informant's ear. But at that moment, Hexi Kui still did not respond to Li Cangdong.
1:41:40|1:41:45|His face was covered in blood, just staring at the window with his eyes wide open, already dead.
1:42:49|1:42:57|At a critical moment, [A Di], who had regained consciousness, swung the messenger bag containing gold bars and viciously smashed it onto [Tai Ping]'s head. [Tai Ping] fell to the ground with blood streaming from his mouth and nose.
1:42:58|1:43:11|Exhausted, [A Di] leaned back in the chair, breathing heavily. A black messenger bag on the ground revealed a corner of gold bars, while [Tai Ping] lay convulsing in a pool of blood. Seeing this, [Li Cangdong] finally breathed a sigh of relief and lay down.
1:43:11|1:43:20|[A Di] noticed that the dead He Xi Kui at the door was staring with his eyes wide open, looking in this direction. She crouched and crawled past Tai Ping's body towards He Xi Kui.
1:43:20|1:43:23|She, who was seriously injured, found every step exceptionally difficult.
1:43:23|1:43:31|[Li Cangdong] at this point also eased up and tried to get up. [A Di], who had crawled to the door, was holding Xi Gui's face, which was already covered in blood.
1:43:31|1:43:36|She struggled to prop herself up, leaning her head against the door, unable to help but cry.
1:43:37|1:43:43|She gently touched Xi Kui's face with her hands covered in mud, but never got a response.
1:43:45|1:43:52|The person who gave her warmth died right in front of her. [A Di] trembled lips and tears kept falling.
1:43:52|1:43:58|If it weren't for his impulsive decision to go after that bag of gold, perhaps [Xi Gui] would still have a glimmer of hope.
1:43:58|1:44:3|Unfortunately, there are no "ifs," and regretful tears cannot change what has already happened.
1:44:3|1:44:7|[Li Cangdong] finally struggled to get up and looked at the two people in front of him.
1:44:8|1:44:13|A Di, who was sobbing uncontrollably, gently shook Xi Gui, hoping for some response.
1:44:13|1:44:17|Li Cangdong, who was unwilling to accept it, propped himself up, feeling uneasy inside.
1:44:17|1:44:23|In the end, he supported himself against the wall, clutching a document bag, and limped away from here.
1:44:24|1:44:32|The staggering figure seemed to be resentful of fate's mockery, the determined 1 million in the bag ultimately failed to be handed over to Xi Gui.
1:44:33|1:44:36|Before long, the police arrived at the scene.
1:44:36|1:44:43|Seeing [Ma Da] lying in the corner with blood all over his face was truly shocking. The young police officer led the way to the door.
1:44:56|1:45:2|The zipper of the black body bag was slowly pulled up, and another informant paid with his life.
1:45:2|1:45:11|The city's lights still shine brightly, but the colors are fading into black and white. The departed rest in peace, while the living must continue to face the future.
1:45:11|1:45:20|That day, a car broke the tranquility of the night, slowed down as it entered the alley, and the person waiting there was none other than [Li Cangdong].
1:45:20|1:45:25|He had bandages on his head, a cast on his arm, and was holding a briefcase in his other hand.
1:45:25|1:45:34|A car stopped in front of him, and a bald, scar-faced fat man got out. [Li Cangdong] picked up the briefcase and handed it to him.
1:45:47|1:45:54|[Li Cangdong] takes out a stack of cash. At this moment, [Li Cangdong] frowns.
1:45:55|1:46:1|He glared fiercely at the bald man. Later, the injured [Li Cangdong] arrived at a nightclub.
