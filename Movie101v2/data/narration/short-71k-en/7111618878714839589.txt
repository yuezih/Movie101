0:2:2|0:2:9|The ten-year agreement has passed in a flash, and now [Wu Xie] stands in front of the bronze door holding the tomb-raiding notes filled with various ancient tomb information.
0:2:9|0:2:20|Although the Bronze Gate is famous in the tomb-robbing world, just by looking at the fresh wounds on [Wu Xie] and Wang [Fatty]'s faces, and their exhausted appearance, it is clear that standing in front of the gate is not an easy task.
0:2:20|0:2:32|[Wu Xie] confirmed that the bronze gate was in front of him, and Wang [Fatty] intuitively took out the Kylin seal. Following the instructions in the book, he inserted the seal into the mechanism at the bottom of the giant stone.
0:2:32|0:2:39|The moment the seal touched the mechanism, the bronze gate, which had been lifeless just now, began to move like an electrified machine.
0:2:39|0:2:49|As the gears carved with exquisite patterns on both sides of the gate kept turning, the gate slowly opened, and [Wu Xie] tried hard to see the world behind the door, but the incoming golden light made it impossible for him to open his eyes.
0:2:49|0:3:4|At this moment, a foot stepped through the bronze door. Wu Xie and Wang [Fatty] in front of the door endured the glaring light, squinting to see a man walking out slowly behind the door. This man was dressed in a sweater, with a beautiful and stern appearance, the leader of the guardian spirit clan, Zhang Qiling.
0:4:20|0:4:26|[Zeng Xiaoxian] seemed to possess a supernatural power. With a gentle burp, he sent the two gunmen holding guns flying into the woods.
0:4:26|0:4:30|At this moment, a beam of light descended from the sky and hit [Zeng Xiaoxian].
0:5:24|0:5:30|Accompanied by the cross-talk of [Zeng Xiaoxian], Lu Ziqiao and the others who were having breakfast looked at him speechlessly.
0:5:32|0:5:59|You have become the protagonist of The Lost Tomb. [Xeng Xiaoxian] nodded smugly. The rest of the Love Apartment group are all loyal fans of The Lost Tomb, and they naturally can't accept that [Xeng Xiaoxian] is the protagonist. After a bout of nausea, [Xeng Xiaoxian] also talked about the reason for reading The Lost Tomb. If it weren't for your "Moon, My Heart" being changed to The Lost Tomb late-night radio drama, I wouldn't have read this kind of trash novel. Lu Ziqiao suddenly changed the subject and asked,
0:5:59|0:6:5|When mentioning [Hu Yifei], [Xiao Xian] instantly recalled the awkward moment when Nolan hugged her and was bumped by Yifei.
0:6:5|0:6:8|[Xiao Xian] immediately shrank back.
0:6:39|0:6:47|Coincidentally, [Hu Yifei] walked in from the balcony at this moment, but [Xeng Xiaoxian] clearly no longer believed in himself.
0:6:54|0:6:57|Before [Zeng Xiaoxian] could finish speaking, he immediately closed his mouth upon seeing [Hu Yifei].
0:7:57|0:8:13|As he spoke, [Xiao Xian]â€™s eyes began to moisten. After taking a sip of the drink next to him, he continued speaking to the few listeners.
0:10:2|0:10:19|[Xiao Xian] Although looking puzzled, upon seeing [Hu Yifei]'s number, he still entered the elevator to keep the appointment. At this moment, a strange thing happened - [Xiao Xian] suddenly noticed that all the floor buttons in the elevator had turned into the word "celebration". It seemed like this elevator only had one destination. Feeling puzzled, he randomly pressed one button.
0:10:19|0:10:21|At this moment, a voice prompt is heard from the elevator.
0:10:28|0:10:54|The elevator unexpectedly ascended at an extremely fast speed. Unprepared, [Xeng Xiaoxian] was thrown to the ground. He struggled to get up and shouted, "Xiaoyang, I've adapted!" Before he could finish his sentence, the lights in the elevator suddenly changed and the speed of ascent multiplied exponentially. In the blink of an eye, it reached the height of the 500th floor. Inside the elevator, [Xeng Xiaoxian] was knocked upside down. After a moment, the elevator doors slowly opened, and [Zhang Wei] looked at the tumbling [Xeng Xiaoxian] and said, "Teacher Xeng, why are you just arriving? Quickly call the police."
0:11:0|0:11:24|[Lu Ziqiao] looked at the casually dressed [Xeng Xiaoxian] and said, bewildered, [Xeng Xiaoxian] was dragged out of the elevator by [Zhang Wei] and [Lu Ziqiao] to the high-tech celebration hall. At this moment, the celebration event officially began, welcoming everyone to the protagonist's halo upgrade celebration. The protagonist's halo is truly something.
0:11:26|0:11:39|I must be dreaming, right? The still-dazed [Zeng Xiaoxian] was immediately captivated by the elegant [Tang Youyou], [Chen Meijia], and [Hu Yifei] descending the stairs. The three of them, dressed to the nines, were all stunning, with [Hu Yifei] at the back catching [Zeng Xiaoxian]'s unwavering gaze.
0:12:1|0:12:14|Years of arduous adventures have drained the energy of their protagonist halo, and today the adventure is about to restart. The brave and fearless trio of tomb raiders will face a whole new protagonist halo.
0:12:14|0:12:27|0plus' new generation protagonist aura has been fully upgraded, with a more powerful processor and longer-lasting energy. The top ten functions will escort your exciting adventures, everyone is life.
0:12:32|0:12:49|After the advertisement for the protagonist's halo finished, the group couldn't wait to enter the venue. Security guards were scanning every person entering with the protagonist's halo detector. Different protagonists would display different levels, and each of them, including [Lu Ziqiao], had a D level, until the confident [Zeng Xiaoxian] arrived.
0:13:43|0:13:47|[Zeng Xiaoxian] reluctantly took the briefcase containing the pirated protagonist halo.
0:13:47|0:13:56|At this moment, the trio of [Wu Xie] walked out accompanied by the screams of fans.
0:14:10|0:14:17|[The character Hu Yifei, who wanted to take a group photo, suddenly saw the character Zeng Xiaoxian.]
0:14:46|0:14:53|[Wu Xie], [Chen Meijia], and [Zhang Wei] bid farewell to the enthusiastic crowd and found a secluded corner, eagerly opening the suitcase.
0:14:53|0:14:57|In the box, a plastic toy hoop with a strong sense of plasticity is quietly placed.
0:14:57|0:15:3|[Wu Xie] picked up the ring and pulled hard on it, causing the ring to glow faintly like a glow stick.
0:15:3|0:15:4|Wu Xie exclaimed in surprise at the sight.
0:15:12|0:15:24|Later, [Wu Xie] followed the instructions in the box and installed the components before putting it on his head. A circle of flashing neon lights was tied to the model's ring, making it look very childish when placed there.
0:15:29|0:15:46|At this moment, [Zhang Qiling] also nodded seriously at [Wu Xie]. The three of them, who were clueless about high technology, walked into the elevator with toy hula hoops, thinking they looked cool. This ridiculous scene was quietly observed by [Xeng Xiaoxian] and his group who were secretly following them. After the elevator doors closed completely for [Wu Xie] and his friends,
0:15:46|0:15:49|Even the die-hard fan [Zhang Wei] couldn't bear to watch and said,
0:15:58|0:16:10|Encouraged by everyone, [Xiao Xian] cautiously opened the genuine briefcase he had dropped. In the moment he appeared in the spotlight with others, his heartbeat seemed to fluctuate along with theirs.
0:16:10|0:16:15|Everyone was attracted by the halo in front of them. After a moment, [Zhang Wei] saw the instructions on the box.
0:16:15|0:16:46|Surprisingly, there was still an instruction manual. Just as the group was about to read the manual, the halo in the village suddenly rose to dozens of meters high on the top of the main hall. In the next second, a huge halo burst out from within the faintly glowing halo, emitting an earth-shattering amount of energy. The halo emitted an incredibly dazzling light, illuminating every corner of the main hall. Following that, the protagonist's halo injected energy into the bodies of the six individuals and left marks on the back of their necks. At this moment, Lu Ziqiao exclaimed in amazement, "The model is much better than the genuine product, it doesn't make sense."
0:17:23|0:17:41|Several people happily entered the elevator and left the lobby. When the elevator door opened again, they found themselves in the world of "The Lost Tomb". As they walked out of the hall with anticipation, they were shocked by the scene before them. In this dim world of "The Lost Tomb", there was a chilling and terrifying atmosphere lingering in the air.
0:17:41|0:17:53|Here gather elite tomb raiders from around the world, all armed and looking fierce. The six members of the Ai Qin Apartment are dressed in Tang Dynasty suits and long skirts, standing out from the tomb raiders here.
0:17:53|0:18:1|The passing tomb raiders looked at them with eyes like evil wolves spotting sheep, as if in the next second, they would devour them completely.
0:18:1|0:18:9|Just then, the radio suddenly blared, followed by the vendors along the street turning on their lights and opening for business, instantly transforming the dimly lit street into a bustling scene.
0:18:9|0:18:16|The variety of businesses here is even more abundant, in addition to eating, drinking, and entertainment, there are also arms dealers and red-light districts, making it overwhelming for the viewers.
0:18:16|0:18:23|On the other side, Wu Xie and Fatty returned to the ancestral home after walking the dog in the morning, but the old butler hurriedly said to Wu Xie.
0:19:5|0:19:8|Fatty saw the situation and said to [Wu Xie].
0:19:10|0:19:21|Er Ye heard the movement behind him, slowly stood up and faced the two people. Surprisingly, Er Ye was holding a bowl of noodles. The gasping just now was only because the noodles were too spicy.
0:20:52|0:20:54|Fatty took the business card and said.
0:21:8|0:21:18|Huang Heihong, accompanied by bodyguards, walked through the crowd with a smile, passing between [Wu Xie] and Fatty. After the pedestrians left, [Wu Xie] and Fatty discussed Huang Heihong's conspiracy.
0:22:7|0:22:14|[Wu Xie] closed his eyes and began to meditate. After a moment, the aura of the protagonist of the pirated version appeared in his mind.
0:22:14|0:22:20|And the halo of the pirated protagonist is ultimately just a model, it simply can't withstand the powerful mental strength of [Wu Xie].
0:22:20|0:22:29|From the moment the spiritual power was injected, the protagonist's aura of piracy instantly collapsed, and [Wu Xie] began to suffer even more due to the massive damage to his spiritual power.
0:22:34|0:22:49|As soon as Fatty finished speaking, [Wu Xie] rolled his eyes and passed out.
0:22:49|0:22:55|After listening to Zhang Wei's words, everyone suddenly realized and all turned their accusing eyes towards [Xeng Xiaoxian].
0:23:48|0:23:55|The characters from "Love Apartment" may not be skilled in martial arts, but they are quite good at escaping. In the blink of an eye, they disappeared into the bustling city.
0:23:55|0:24:3|[Zhang Qiling] held a long knife in his hand, carefully searching in the bustling market. However, the few people who were clearly dressed differently from the surroundings seemed to be invisible.
0:24:3|0:24:7|[Zhang Qiling] searched all the way to the red light district, but still did not find the few people.
0:24:7|0:24:14|To her surprise, [Xiao Xian] was right behind her in the display case, dancing a sexy pole dance with a scantily clad beauty.
0:24:14|0:24:20|[Xiao Xian] looked at the close [Zhang Qiling], not only did not panic, but also smiled and tapped on the glass, making a funny face.
0:24:20|0:24:26|In the next moment, [Zhang Qiling] suddenly turned around, and [Xeng Xiaoxian] who had nowhere to escape was grabbed and pressed against the table.
0:24:49|0:24:58|[Zhang Qiling] pushed [Xeng Xiaoxian] to the ground, then swiftly aimed a fatal blow, but surprisingly, [Hu Yifei] suddenly appeared and caught the blade.
0:25:13|0:25:15|Pulling out the blade, he headed towards [Tang Youyou].
0:25:15|0:25:19|Fortunately, [Tang Youyou] has some skills and managed to dodge the attack with agility.
0:25:19|0:25:24|Hu Yifei was about to kick back, but her movement was restricted by her long skirt.
0:25:24|0:25:26|Zhang Qiling seized the opportunity and punched, knocking him back several meters.
0:25:28|0:25:40|Furious [Hu Yifei] explosively ripped off the long skirt cleanly along the thighs, leaving [Zeng Xiaoxian] and [Zhang Wei] trembling in the corner, looking at [Hu Yifei] like a mystery. With a glance, [Hu Yifei] signaled the two to leave first.
0:25:40|0:25:56|After [Xiao Xian] left, a showdown between the top fighters from "Love Apartment" and "The Lost Tomb" was about to begin. [Zhang Qiling] was the first to swing his sword at [Hu Yifei]. Without the constraint of a long skirt this time, [Hu Yifei] unleashed her full strength, kicking away the blade and following up with a shadowless kick right into [Zhang Qiling]'s chest.
0:25:57|0:26:3|[Zhang Qiling], who quickly adjusted himself, swung his knife towards [Hu Yifei] again, but unexpectedly, the narrow space caused the long knife to get stuck between the stairs.
0:26:3|0:26:12|[Hu Yifei] seized the opportunity and launched a series of heavy punches towards [Zhang Qiling]. However, [Hu Yifei] was ultimately a woman, so even such attacks only scratched the surface of [Zhang Qiling].
0:26:12|0:26:20|On the other hand, [Hu Yifei] retreated all the way and was forced into a small room. [Hu Yifei] cleverly used the refrigerator door to block the two blades that were swung towards her.
0:26:20|0:26:26|He had no way out, picked up an apple nearby and threw it at [Zhang Qiling], but how could this small apple stop [Zhang Qiling]?
0:26:27|0:26:31|He swiftly raised his knife and the flying apple was instantly sliced in half.
0:26:31|0:26:35|[Zhang Qiling] is like playing a game of cutting fruit, slicing each thrown fruit one by one.
0:26:35|0:26:40|After throwing the fruit, [Hu Yifei] had a sudden inspiration and moved to the roof through the window next to her.
0:26:40|0:26:47|Zhang Qiling followed closely behind, taking a giant leap towards the roof. However, as soon as he landed and before he could steady himself, he was sent flying several meters by a powerful strike from [Hu Yifei].
0:26:47|0:26:53|Zhang Qiling, in pain, no longer holds back, the two lock eyes for a moment, then simultaneously leap up and launch full-force attacks at each other.
0:26:55|0:26:57|Ziqiao has disguised himself as a recruiter.
0:27:14|0:27:21|As soon as the words fell, the tiled wall behind everyone collapsed instantly. After the smoke cleared, [Hu Yifei] was lying on the ground with injuries all over her body.
0:27:21|0:27:25|The next moment, [Zhang Qiling] walked towards them with a steel knife in hand, without saying a word.
0:27:25|0:27:28|He raised the knife and slashed towards [Hu Yifei].
0:27:42|0:27:50|Zhang Qiling swung his knife again, but this time he was intercepted by Chen Meijia.
0:27:50|0:27:51|Once again swinging the knife, [Zhang Wei] intercepted.
0:28:34|0:28:39|Shortly after, Zhang Qiling informed the others about Wu Xie being hospitalized due to brain overload and falling into a coma.
0:28:39|0:28:53|Meanwhile, [Wu Xie] lying on the hospital bed still showed no signs of waking up. His good friend Wang Fatty paced anxiously outside the ward. Just then, Huang Heihong, who had received the news, arrived outside the ward with four bodyguards, carrying flowers and nutritional supplements.
0:28:54|0:28:57|Wang [Fatty] knew that his intentions were impure, so he stepped forward to stop him.
0:29:40|0:29:45|On the TV screen, Er Kang was seen vigorously shaking Zi Wei.
0:29:49|0:29:51|Soon after, [Hu Yifei] and [Tang Youyou] walked into the ward.
0:31:37|0:31:42|Wu Xie, who has not fully recovered his memory, believes in the words of Huang, Hei, and Hong without any doubt.
0:33:10|0:33:15|[Zeng Xiaoxian]'s inspiring words not only resonated with bystanders who were not involved, but also received enthusiastic applause.
0:33:19|0:33:25|The whole crowd at the scene cheered for [Zeng Xiaoxian], even [Zhang Qiling] reluctantly agreed after hearing it.
0:33:42|0:33:49|At the same time, Huang, Hei, and Hong, along with [Wu Xie], arrived at Changbai Mountain with a large number of armed special forces, flying in a large helicopter.
0:34:0|0:34:11|While [Zhang Qiling] was arranging the plan, Huang Heihong and Wuxie had already entered the scene of the tomb raiders' annual meeting through a secret passage. At the same time, the six residents of the Love Apartment also changed into the same costumes as the other tomb raiders.
0:34:12|0:34:15|The group of people appeared on stage like a fashion show.
0:34:15|0:34:20|The first to appear is [Hu Yifei] in a tank top, her outfit serious yet sexy.
0:34:20|0:34:26|Following closely behind is [Lu Ziqiao], who appears to have some misunderstandings about tomb raiders.
0:34:26|0:34:33|Next up is [Tang Youyou] carrying a bow and arrow, the special forces soldier [Zhang Wei] with a machine gun in hand, and the clown girl [Chen Meijia] holding a baseball bat.
0:34:33|0:34:41|The last one to appear, [Zeng Xiaoxian], was the funniest. While others were holding weapons, he was holding a magnifying glass with a silly look, resembling an explorer.
0:35:22|0:35:25|Seeing [Zeng Xiaoxian] in a dilemma, everyone walked into the press conference venue.
0:36:28|0:36:31|They were then taken to the underground warehouse.
0:36:31|0:36:35|After the administrator turned on the power switch, a large sphere in the warehouse lit up.
0:36:51|0:36:55|The two of them couldn't help but be fascinated by the high-tech sphere in front of them.
0:36:55|0:36:59|[Xiao Xian] casually touched a button.
0:36:59|0:37:5|The doors on both sides of the spherical cabin rose slowly, and the two of them sat in out of curiosity.
0:37:5|0:37:10|Only two seats in the cabin looked somewhat normal, while the rest of the buttons and indicator lights were unfamiliar to both [Hu Yifei] and [Tang Youyou].
0:38:59|0:39:5|The [Decision Maker No.2], standing three stories high, leaped lightly from the stage to behind the crowd.
0:40:50|0:40:55|Decision Maker Number One panicked immediately upon seeing Number Two aiming the gun at himself.
0:41:19|0:41:34|In a moment of urgency, [Lu Ziqiao] casually flicked the trackball that had just emerged, causing the "Decider No. 1" to instantly start rolling. The bullets fired by the enemies could not cause substantial harm to him. While rolling, he also knocked [Wu Xie] unconscious on the ground, and Fatty took [Wu Xie]'s pistol.
0:41:37|0:41:47|And immediately ran to [Wu Xie] to check the situation. At this moment, a large number of special forces soldiers started shooting at Fatty. Just then, [Xeng Xiaoxian] drove [Decision Maker No.1] to shield the two of them.
0:42:0|0:42:8|Soon, the remaining three special forces soldiers also received their boxed meals. At this moment, outside the venue, people were still dancing, completely unaware of the impending danger.
0:42:16|0:42:23|Several people were quite scared by the fire in the venue. When they saw the opportunity to hide in [Decision Maker No. 1], they even threw their weapons aside.
0:42:23|0:42:27|In this way, a machine that was originally only able to accommodate two people is now packed with eight people.
0:42:48|0:43:4|[Decision Maker No. 1] stumbled forward in the chaos, but suddenly the wall behind the venue exploded. As the smoke cleared, a massive armored mech stood tall, causing everyone to flee in panic.
0:43:4|0:43:9|At this moment, [Decision Maker No.2] also activated automatic attack mode.
0:43:13|0:43:16|Two missiles were launched towards the direction where [Zhang Qiling] was located.
0:43:16|0:43:20|The first ship's pile hurriedly dodged, but he had just avoided the missile and hadn't recovered yet.
0:43:20|0:43:38|Machine gun number 2 was already pouring bullets towards him, but luckily the defense of number 1 was indeed strong enough. Even with such intense firepower coverage, it couldn't cause substantial damage to him. He continued to agilely dodge behind various covers under the control of the group, and this high-speed movement also made the people hiding in the mecha almost suffocate.
0:43:38|0:43:52|The intense barrage from Destroyer No. 2 has turned the anti-law street into ruins. Just as No. 1 is about to have no way out, No. 2 also unleashes its trump card, with a missile launcher on the back of the mecha carrying 18 missiles.
0:43:52|0:44:10|In the next second, 18 missiles were simultaneously launched towards [Decision Maker No.1], and the entire street looked like a hell, with anything in front of the missiles instantly turning into nothingness. Despite such a carpet bombing, [Decision Maker No.1] managed to break through the fire line with a defense as strong as gold.
0:44:10|0:44:12|He ran straight towards the huge ventilation duct.
0:44:12|0:44:27|The joy of victory was short-lived as the next moment, the smiles of the group froze. It turned out that the [Destroyer No.1] had crashed through the mountain, revealing a bottomless abyss beneath their feet. Even the sturdy [Destroyer No.1], if it fell to the bottom of the valley, would have no chance of survival.
0:45:20|0:45:26|After he stood up, an inflatable doll popped up on the seat, as if flying the plane for him.
0:45:31|0:45:34|Wu Xie, who has been healed, has regained his memory.
0:46:28|0:46:30|[Xiao Xian] stood up triumphantly.
0:46:38|0:46:41|[Hu Yifei] confidently walked up to [Zeng Xiaoxian].
0:46:45|0:46:47|[Xiao Xian] shook his head.
0:46:50|0:46:52|Upon seeing [Xu Xin] nod, Yifei continued speaking.
0:46:57|0:46:59|[Xiao Xian] nodded firmly with determination in his eyes.
0:47:2|0:47:4|At this moment, [Xeng Xiaoxian] was still at a loss.
0:47:6|0:47:11|Zhang Qiling threw a punch directly at [Xeng Xiaoxian]'s face, followed by a combination of punches.
0:47:11|0:47:16|Zeng Xiaoxian, who had no idea what was happening, was mercilessly knocked down by Zhang Qiling.
0:47:16|0:47:21|The protagonist [Xiao Xian], who is blessed with the halo effect, is practically immune to this level of attack.
0:47:21|0:47:26|The next second, he stood up from the ground unharmed.
0:47:33|0:47:43|[Wu Xie] finished speaking and immediately pounced on [Xeng Xiaoxian], delivering a merciless beating until he was exhausted, but to his surprise, [Xeng Xiaoxian] emerged unscathed.
0:47:53|0:47:58|On the other side, in the ruined street, Huang Hei Hong angrily asked his subordinates.
0:48:9|0:48:12|Hu Yifei's face, with a yellow, black, and red complexion, revealed a sinister smile.
0:48:18|0:48:46|Wu Xie and others, after hours of flying, finally arrived at the location of the Cloud Top Heavenly Palace. Tang Youyou curiously asked, "How should we find this guardian soul?" The guardian soul is the protector of the Bronze Gate. To summon him, there must be clues behind the gate. We need to enter the Bronze Gate to unravel the ultimate mystery. There is a secret passage at the foot of the mountain leading to the Cloud Top Heavenly Palace. We must hurry to reach the Bronze Gate before the Yellow, Black, and Red. The group armed themselves and walked out of the plane.
0:48:46|0:48:50|Carrying a mountaineering pole, [Zhang Qiling] carefully walks step by step on the snowy ground.
0:48:50|0:48:59|Not long after they left, [Wu Xie] looked towards [Zhang Qiling] not far away, only to see him silently kneeling on a huge rock at the edge of the cliff, muttering words of worship in his mouth.
0:48:59|0:49:4|At this moment, everyone looked at this scene of confusion and, without planning it, all stopped in their tracks.
0:49:4|0:49:8|After a moment, [Zhang Qiling] knocked three times towards Mount Taibai.
0:49:8|0:49:10|Lu Ziqiao asked in confusion.
0:49:12|0:49:16|Wu Xie turned around and found Zhang Wei's eyes were twitching frantically.
0:49:16|0:49:18|At this moment, [Tang Youyou] also noticed something unusual about her body.
0:49:46|0:49:53|Eyelid twitching, protruding teeth, crows, black cats - all these ominous signs happened at the same time.
0:50:0|0:50:3|As the music just ended, the flag made by [Hu Yifei] was broken and fell to the ground.
0:50:8|0:50:13|Wu Xie, who has experienced countless tomb raids, no longer puts up a tough front when he sees the situation, and quickly kneels down to join the others in defeating the enemy.
0:50:13|0:50:16|On the other side, [Xeng Xiaoxian] spoke to Decision Maker No.1.
0:50:34|0:50:38|To Zeng Xiaoxian's surprise, Wang Fatty was watching a soccer match inside the machine.
0:50:58|0:51:1|Moments later, Hu Yifei soared into the sky as Decision Maker No. 1.
0:51:1|0:51:8|As soon as the words fell, Number One smashed in front of the group.
0:51:23|0:51:27|When the group studying the map came to their senses, they found a deep pit in the glacier in front of them.
0:51:27|0:51:40|Several people looked into the deep pit, only to see the Number One Abyss floating on the water.
0:51:40|0:51:44|[Zhang Wei] saw a mechanism carved with exquisite patterns on a nearby stone.
0:51:44|0:51:48|After blowing away the floating snow on top, he turned to [Hu Yifei] beside him with a puzzled look.
0:51:53|0:51:59|At the moment when the mechanism was activated, a deep pit where [Xeng Xiaoxian] and Wang [Fatty] were located suddenly roared loudly.
0:51:59|0:52:3|The next moment, the surroundings of the deep pit began to tremble as if an earthquake had struck.
0:52:3|0:52:6|Next, a huge vortex formed on the water surface.
0:52:6|0:52:10|In the blink of an eye, Hu Yifei and Tang Youyou, led by Lu Ziqiao, were all swept into the depths of the cave by the decisive number one.
0:52:10|0:52:13|[Tang Youyou] looked at this familiar scene and said.
0:52:17|0:52:22|[Tang Youyou]'s flower shadow had just fallen, when they faintly heard the rumbling sound coming from the mountaintop.
0:52:22|0:52:28|The voice grew louder and more urgent, attracting the attention of everyone.
0:52:31|0:52:49|The speed of this avalanche is beyond imagination. In just a few tens of meters, the avalanche has caught up to the halfway point of the mountain. [Wu Xie] leads everyone to sprint on the perilous cliff, where a slight misstep could lead to a fall into the abyss. Faced with this overwhelming avalanche, the group has no time to think about much else.
0:52:51|0:52:57|Just as the leader of the thousand troops, [Wu Xie], led everyone into the cave ahead, and the avalanche almost simultaneously swallowed the entrance.
0:53:26|0:53:32|Wu Xie, trapped at the mouth of the frozen snow by an avalanche, is still trying to dig out a passage with a shovel.
0:54:29|0:54:32|Yifei saw Wu Xie looking speechless.
0:54:39|0:54:43|And so, [Wu Xie] unexpectedly started teaching a few people about tomb robbing in the cave.
0:54:55|0:54:58|Wu Xie's words had just fallen when the candle mysteriously extinguished.
0:55:0|0:55:3|Unexpectedly, [Meijia Chen] lit the torch at the Mysterious Family.
0:55:48|0:55:49|They all gave a thumbs up.
0:56:30|0:56:38|Yoyo and the others were speaking anxiously, leaving Zhang Xianxian completely confused.
0:56:38|0:56:41|Watching the thoughtful expressions of the group, [Wu Xie] asked slowly.
0:56:51|0:56:54|He said it himself, and also discovered something unusual from his phone.
0:56:54|0:57:1|When he put down his phone and looked around, he found that the entire cave was filled with starlight like the Milky Way, rapidly approaching him.
0:57:1|0:57:6|Just as he was still shocked, a snake had already slithered into his clothes.
0:57:6|0:57:10|Newcomer [Xeng Xiaoxian] was so scared by the situation that he stood still and dared not move.
0:57:10|0:57:14|Just as a large amount of oil and salt was about to engulf it, Wang [Fatty] knocked it into the ball.
0:57:23|0:57:28|[Lu Ziqiao] sent a red envelope in the WeChat group, only to have it instantly snatched by [Zeng Xiaoxian].
0:57:39|0:57:47|After a loud noise, the small oil and salt that were originally scattered with iron balls immediately scattered and fled. In the darkness, there was a vague giant creature approaching the iron balls.
0:57:47|0:57:53|Through the screen of Decision Maker No.1, Hu Yifei and Tang Youyou saw a huge eye staring at them.
0:57:53|0:58:5|Soon after, strong tremors were felt all around, as two giant oil-salt creatures, covered in magma and tens of meters long, surrounded the iron ball. The terrifying roar emitted by the giant oil-salt creatures made everyone break out in a cold sweat.
0:58:5|0:58:8|Soon after, [Hu Yifei] and [Tang Youyou] used their heads to repeatedly hit the iron ball in order to break it.
0:58:13|0:58:17|With a full force strike from the giant oil and salt, the iron ball flew directly into the nearby dark passage.
0:58:17|0:58:23|After rolling down the secret passage for a while, the iron ball dropped into another pitch-black cave.
0:58:27|0:58:31|After turning on the light, [Hu Yifei] was shocked to see skeletons scattered all over the place.
0:59:54|1:0:1|Reluctant Decision Maker No.1 extended a large iron claw from behind, grabbing Hu Yifei like a claw machine.
1:0:1|1:0:9|Just as the two were marveling at the power of the machine, Hu Yifei had already been smoothly placed into the trunk.
1:0:17|1:0:22|Hu Yifei took out pots and pans from the iron ball, preparing for battle. The giant oil and salt, seeing this, roared even more angrily.
1:0:25|1:0:59|[Xiao Xian] and Fatty hurriedly drove the Decider No. 1 in reverse at high speed in an attempt to shake off the giant oil salt behind them. However, despite its huge size, the giant oil salt, with the support of dozens of legs, moved faster than a metal ball. The two could only drive the metal ball around the wall. Fortunately, the metal ball's agile movements cleverly avoided the attacks of the giant oil salt, and they finally escaped when they flew out of the cave. After the ordeal, the two of them were shouting excitedly. On the other side, [Wu Xie] and his team were cautiously exploring, when suddenly the background music started playing. The unexpected music instantly energized the officers of the Love Apartment.
1:1:11|1:1:25|The original song turned out to be the theme song of "Love Apartment", "My Future Comes from Change". They didn't care about any demons or monsters in their way, each of their faces instantly filled with happy smiles, walking and dancing joyfully.
1:1:25|1:1:29|Only [Wu Xie] and [Zhang Qiling] were at a loss, not knowing what evil these few people had fallen into.
1:1:30|1:1:35|The group continued to explore deeper into the cave, accompanied by music, without stopping.
1:1:35|1:1:44|[Wu Xie] and the others, along with [Zeng Xiaoxian] and Fatty, although they split up, they were very clear that their destination was the Cloud Top Heaven Palace that the entire tomb-robbing world yearned for.
1:1:44|1:1:50|Wu Xie, Zhang Qiling, and Fatty became much happier with the addition of the Love Apartment crew.
1:1:50|1:1:55|Although they were joking and not very serious, they have always been united and helped each other along the way.
1:1:55|1:2:0|The characters from "Love Apartment" did not become a burden on the road of tomb robbing.
1:2:0|1:2:4|On the contrary, with the protagonist halo around them, they make demons and monsters keep their distance.
1:2:4|1:2:12|They climbed hand in hand over narrow cliffs, passed through caves filled with oil and salt, stepped over the magma at the bottom of the cave, and also arrived at the secret chamber full of gold.
1:2:13|1:2:18|But even in the face of numerous difficulties and temptations, nothing could stop the group from moving forward.
1:2:18|1:2:25|[Xiao Xian] and Fatty drove the Land Rover No. 1, singing all the way, and the group of Wu Xie also arrived at a beautiful scenic spot.
1:2:25|1:2:28|Each family looked at the small fish in the water.
1:3:11|1:3:14|[Lu Ziqiao] was amazed by the absurd scene.
1:3:33|1:3:40|After listening to [Zhang Qiling], the only remaining delivery guy put on his helmet, walked confidently towards the outside under the gaze of everyone.
1:3:40|1:3:43|[Lu Ziqiao] walked up to Yifei and Youyou and started complaining.
1:3:55|1:4:3|Chen Meijia was seen feeding Zhang Qiling chicken nuggets on the side, while Wu Xie, not far away, looked at the two with jealousy on his face.
1:4:3|1:4:7|At this moment, Zhang Wei also walked up to Wu Xie with takeout in hand.
1:5:29|1:5:35|[Zhang Wei] listened, pondered for a moment, then picked up the bottle and took a big sip before saying.
1:7:29|1:7:38|[Hu Yifei], although reluctant, still dialed [Zeng Xiaoxian]'s phone number under the urging of everyone.
1:7:38|1:7:44|On the other end of the phone, there was silence for a long time, guessed [Zeng Xiaoxian].
1:8:26|1:8:35|And on the other end of the phone, [Zeng Xiaoxian] was still immersed in the goodnight wishes from earlier, constantly speculating on [Hu Yifei]'s intentions.
1:8:35|1:8:40|After the game segment ended, Hu Yifei, Tang Youyou, Lu Ziqiao, Zhang Wei, and Fatty all lay down on the ground in the cave and fell asleep.
1:8:40|1:8:47|Chen Meijia, who was fast asleep, was startled by the falling books and turned around to see a small, round-headed owl.
1:8:50|1:8:53|The little owl flew to the top of a higher pillar when it saw someone waking up.
1:8:53|1:9:3|[Chen Meijia] looked at this cute little guy, not knowing what he was up to, but moments later, he flew out of the cave.
1:9:3|1:9:8|Attracted by Chen Meijia, Hu Yifei followed her out, but accidentally slipped and fell to the bottom of the valley.
1:9:9|1:9:12|He fell right into a passage.
1:9:12|1:9:16|Chen Meijia slid all the way down the narrow passage to the edge of the cliff.
1:9:16|1:9:32|Chen Meijia was shocked by the scene before her, she even forgot about her own pain. The scenery at the bottom of the valley was calm, completely different from the fragrant flowers and chirping birds just now. Countless caves covered the sides of the valley hundreds of meters high, like pores on the mountain. Chen Meijia stared intently and broke out in a cold sweat.
1:9:32|1:9:47|In each cave, there was a nearly two-meter-tall adult owl sleeping. Everyone tried to sneak away, but when they turned around, they were startled by the owl next to them.
1:9:47|1:9:53|As soon as Hu Yifei and Tang Youyou regained consciousness, they were knocked down by the donkey bridge they were looking for and fell to the bottom of the valley together.
1:9:57|1:10:3|[Chen Meijia] cautiously pointed around the cave where the sleeping owls were after stopping Ziqiao from speaking loudly.
1:10:17|1:10:19|Lu Ziqiao understood her meaning.
1:10:21|1:10:23|And [Chen Meijia] just smiled and nodded.
1:10:24|1:10:36|Unexpectedly, the two of them started communicating fluently using their own invented sign language. Lu Ziqiao, who was full of jealousy the whole way, suddenly complained about Tang Youyou's excessive infatuation with Zhang Qiling, while Tang Youyou deliberately avoided the question.
1:10:36|1:10:46|Ziqiao didn't ask any more questions when he saw this, and gestured for Tang Youyou to leave quietly first.
1:10:46|1:10:52|Embarrassingly, just as she took the first step, [Chen Meijia] stepped on a squeaky toy chicken. Right after scolding [Lu Ziqiao], she then popped a balloon.
1:10:54|1:10:55|The two of them quickened their pace.
1:11:4|1:11:9|Never did I expect that in this valley filled with bones, there would be so many things that can make noise.
1:11:9|1:11:13|The two of them were unlucky as every step they took lightly would trigger a trap.
1:11:13|1:11:18|After this round of operations, there were suddenly tens of thousands of eyes staring at the two in the cave.
1:11:18|1:11:27|Just as the two were at a loss, they saw the owl's head slowly rotate 180 degrees, and then its head opened wide and rushed towards them.
1:11:32|1:11:37|In an instant, the sky above the entire canyon was covered with densely packed owls.
1:11:37|1:11:42|[Lu Ziqiao] and [Chen Meijia] could only desperately run away in the face of such an attack, but the speed difference was just too great.
1:11:42|1:11:49|Hu Yifei and Tang Youyou had not run a few steps when the owl had already caught up from behind. Helpless, the two could only hide in the nearby giant rock town to temporarily evade.
1:11:50|1:11:55|Unexpectedly, the owl knocked the giant rock askew, surrounding the two of them in no time.
1:11:55|1:12:8|At the critical moment, [Zhang Qiling] rushed over upon hearing the noise. He calmly faced the group of owls, holding a sword in his right hand. He cut his palm with the sword, allowing the blood of the unicorn within him to cover the blade, and then forcefully plunged the sword into the ground.
1:12:8|1:12:30|In an instant, [Lu Ziqiao] and [Chen Meijia] were surrounded by three archers. The next second, wearing armor and wielding a long sword, [Lu Ziqiao] paid no attention to the battle, seized the opportunity, and ran back with [Chen Meijia]. However, [Chen Meijia] twisted her ankle and moved slowly.
1:12:30|1:12:33|[Lu Ziqiao] saw Zhao and immediately picked up [Chen Meijia] without hesitation.
1:12:55|1:13:1|After passing through the narrow and blocked cave, a flower sea emitting a faint light suddenly appeared before their eyes.
1:13:8|1:13:14|After admiring for a moment, as they prepared to continue forward, Hu Yifei saw Zhang Wei unfastening his belt.
1:13:29|1:13:34|[Zhang Wei] was having a great time when a tranquilizer dart suddenly shot into the back of his neck.
1:13:34|1:13:36|[Zhang Wei] pulled out the sword and asked.
1:13:36|1:13:39|But as soon as he finished speaking, he rolled his eyes and fainted to the ground.
1:13:39|1:13:44|Next, [Tang Youyou] was also shot.
1:13:44|1:13:53|Realizing the situation, [Wu Xie] and [Hu Yifei] quickly hid behind cover. Just as [Hu Yifei] was about to engage the enemy in battle, she saw the tranquilizer dart stuck in her leg and helplessly said to [Wu Xie].
1:13:58|1:14:7|Wu Xie's position has been locked by the enemy. Even if he exposes a finger, he will be hit by several tranquilizer darts. Self-defense is a problem, let alone saving others.
1:14:7|1:14:15|Wu Xie thought for a moment, then couldn't bear it and ran towards the cave. He put away the yellow-black-red sword-shaped tranquilizer gun and ordered his men to tie up the three unconscious people.
1:14:15|1:14:28|Several hours later, [Zeng Xiaoxian] and Wang Fatty drove the Decider No. 1 to the edge of a cliff. The Decider No. 1 fired two flares into the air, revealing the Cloud Top Heavenly Palace hundreds of meters below the cliff.
1:14:28|1:14:32|Although they were looking down on the palace from a high vantage point, they were still awed by its grandeur.
1:14:32|1:14:39|Wang Fatty said upon seeing him.
1:14:39|1:14:49|At this moment, Hu Yifei suddenly noticed some movement on the road. After zooming in on the screen, it turned out that the special forces in yellow, black, and red were tying up Tang Youyou and the other two, heading towards the Cloud Top Heavenly Palace.
1:14:49|1:14:50|Fatty said to [Xeng Xiaoxian].
1:15:4|1:15:16|Not long after, the special forces entered the Yun Ding Tiangong and set up the equipment. [Hu Yifei] and [Tang Youyou] were tied up on the side, while [Zhang Wei] slowly woke up from the electric chair.
1:15:16|1:15:19|[Tang Youyou] pointed to the various blood-stained tools on the table, as Huang Heihong spoke at this moment.
1:15:57|1:16:2|Hu Yifei, in a fit of anger, orders his men to activate the electric chair switch.
1:16:2|1:16:6|Wong Fei-hung gestured to his men to increase the electric current when [Zhang Wei] remained silent.
1:16:6|1:16:9|Unexpectedly, [Hu Yifei] and [Tang Youyou] on the side, started to provide divine assistance.
1:16:14|1:16:17|[Zhang Wei] was electrocuted and couldn't speak a word.
1:16:17|1:16:21|Wong Fei-hung, seeing the situation, increased the electric current time and time again.
1:16:21|1:16:25|And at this moment, he had no idea that the water beneath his feet was slowly flowing towards the movie.
1:16:25|1:16:26|The next moment, Wong Fei-hung and the others rushed out.
1:16:56|1:17:0|After a moment, the henchmen wiped off the accumulated water and rescued [Hu Yifei].
1:17:0|1:17:3|After [Huang Heihong] changed his wig, he said,
1:17:23|1:17:26|Unexpectedly, after [Huang Heihong] went out, he actually blew up the passage.
1:17:26|1:17:28|[Tang Youyou] looked at the blocked passage.
1:17:28|1:17:29|Worriedly said.
1:17:32|1:17:40|Just then, a strange sound was heard. The two looked over and saw the stone coffin covered in cobwebs on the main hall slowly moving.
1:17:40|1:17:53|Although they were extremely frightened, their hands were bound by iron chains and they couldn't move. They could only watch helplessly as this eerie scene unfolded. Suddenly, a hand firmly grasped the stone coffin, and the next second, [Zhang Qiling] stood up.
1:17:53|1:17:55|Shortly after, Ziqiao carried Chen Meijia out of the coffin.
1:18:0|1:18:2|[Zhang Qiling] walked over and cut the iron chain for the two.
1:19:18|1:19:30|As the Huangheihong activation switch was turned on, an innocent cloud suddenly rose up, and after the explosion sound echoing through the entire underground palace subsided, everyone curiously looked towards the bronze door, only to see that the bronze door in the smoke was surprisingly intact.
1:19:30|1:19:35|[Xiao Xian] sighed.
1:19:35|1:19:39|Huang Heihong looked at the barrage of mockery in the live broadcast and awkwardly explained.
1:19:44|1:19:48|After Huang Heihong ended the live stream, he turned to his subordinates and said.
1:20:13|1:20:33|The crystal gu of the Zhang family who died in the black is ready? In the midst of the conversation, the bronze door behind Huang, Black, and Red slowly opens. Once again, a dazzling light emanates from the door. Everyone present looks incredulously at the bronze door. As Huang, Black, and Red are thinking about how to explain to the audience, their henchmen beside them say in a self-deprecating manner, "Boss, someone is slapping our faces."
1:20:38|1:20:42|This is [Xiao Xian] driving the Decision Maker No.1 to the front of the Bronze Gate.
1:20:54|1:21:3|Wong Fei-hung saw only Wang Fatty and [Xeng Xiaoxian], and then said.
1:21:3|1:21:20|As soon as the words fell, [Wu Xie] Zhang Qiling, who had been hiding in the dark and waiting for an opportunity, along with the Love Apartment group with almost no combat power, walked to the front of the bronze gate with weapons in hand. Even [Zhang Wei], who was shocked to the point of being unable to take care of himself, stared stubbornly at Wong Fei-hung. The group vowed to protect the secret behind the bronze gate at all costs.
1:21:36|1:21:43|Before [Xeng Xiaoxian] could say a second sentence, Huang Heihong pulled the trigger, but Yi Fei instantly arrived in front of [Xeng Xiaoxian] and caught the bullet.
1:22:34|1:22:39|[Zhang Wei] carefully pulled out the manual for the protagonist's halo and said after reading it.
1:23:7|1:23:8|Mei's family.
1:23:12|1:23:18|[Lu Ziqiao] and [Chen Meijia], this pair of long-standing rivals, finally no longer hide their love for each other.
1:23:18|1:23:22|At the last moment of life, their index fingers intertwined and slowly closed their eyes.
1:23:22|1:23:26|And the three people hiding on the side, [Wu Xie], also decided to take a desperate gamble.
1:23:26|1:23:31|After a moment of eye contact, [Hu Yifei] emerged from cover and unleashed the anger in her heart towards the special forces.
1:23:31|1:23:34|In an instant, the previously quiet underground palace was once again engulfed in continuous gunfire.
1:23:35|1:23:46|The frontline special forces were also defeated by the sudden appearance of the three individuals, but faced with too many enemies, the underground palace fell silent once again after a moment.
1:23:46|1:23:51|Behind the bronze door, there was nothing but darkness, with only a towering tree standing tall within.
1:23:58|1:24:2|After [Xiao Xian] listened, he began to carefully observe the big tree.
1:24:2|1:24:12|This big tree is strange. It has an incredibly thick trunk and branches that block out the sky, but it has never grown a single leaf. Inside, there is a thin layer of water everywhere.
1:24:12|1:24:14|[Xiao Xian] said after seeing the reflection in the water.
1:24:27|1:24:32|[Xiao Xian] turned back in surprise after hearing it, never expected to see the WiFi password actually written on the big tree.
1:24:47|1:24:55|Fatty and Wu Xie in front of the bronze gate of Zhang were caught, although they didn't die.
1:24:55|1:24:58|[Zhang Qiling] was seriously injured and hiding above the stone wall.
1:25:36|1:25:40|As soon as the words fell, [Xiao Zhan] was inspired by his own words.
1:26:10|1:26:21|Hu Yifei listened, looking at him weakly, and noticed something wrong. [Zeng Xiaoxian] looked down and saw Yifei covering the wound on his waist. Blood kept flowing from the wound with his heartbeat, soaking his clothes.
1:26:26|1:26:28|Yifei used all her strength and threw herself into [Zeng Xiaoxian]'s arms.
1:27:4|1:27:11|Hu Yifei looked at the self-blaming [Zeng Xiaoxian] with reluctance in her eyes, then slowly raised her hand covered in blood, gently caressing her face.
1:27:11|1:27:15|At this moment, Yifei finally opened up to [Xiao Xian].
1:27:43|1:27:47|Yifei closed her eyes after sincerely saying goodnight to [Xiao Xian].
1:27:47|1:28:2|[Xiao Xian] didn't dare to make eye contact with the woman he had secretly loved for a long time until the very last moment. It wasn't until Yifei left that he trembled and called out her name.
1:28:2|1:28:7|[Zeng Xiaoxian] tightly hugged the departed Hu Yifei, unable to speak.
1:28:7|1:28:10|He felt Hu Yifei's body temperature gradually cooling, filled with despair.
1:28:11|1:28:15|He looked at the deep pit beside him, a bold idea forming in his mind.
1:28:15|1:28:19|Next, he picked up Hu Yifei and walked to the edge of the cave.
1:28:43|1:28:49|[Xiao Xian] spoke, gazing resolutely into the deep void for a moment before jumping without hesitation.
1:28:49|1:28:56|In the real world, [Xiao Xian] suddenly woke up in the hospital room, gasping for breath, and asked the doctor beside him.
1:29:45|1:29:48|[Xiao Xian] looked at the doctor's departing figure, feeling very helpless.
1:29:48|1:29:53|At this moment, the patient sitting on the opposite bed, wearing glasses and reading a newspaper, suddenly spoke up,
1:31:45|1:31:52|Uncle San listened and slowly got up from the sickbed, letting out a long sigh.
1:32:28|1:32:33|[Zeng Xiaoxian] returned to the entrance of the Bronze Gate, only to find that the deep pit next to it was slowly disappearing.
1:32:33|1:32:37|Next, the towering tree was also filled with blood-red color.
1:33:21|1:33:27|Zhang Qiling pointed to his lower body, and Ma Dongmei lowered his head to find that he had turned into a soul floating in the air.
1:33:38|1:33:41|[After a moment of contemplation, [Xiao Xian] furrowed his brow and said,]
1:33:45|1:33:49|The rest of the victims were also floating in the air.
1:34:21|1:34:28|Zhang Qiling couldn't help but touch it when he saw it, and Zhang Qiling's blood unexpectedly activated the armor.
1:34:28|1:34:33|The left arm of the Guardian Armor suddenly flew onto Chen Meijia's arm, emitting a dim light.
1:34:33|1:34:37|After the bright light faded, [Chen Meijia] was seen to have actually reshaped her body.
1:35:0|1:35:16|Zhang Qiling's eyes were particularly determined. After adjusting her sitting posture, she placed the porcelain jar in front of her and hung her bleeding palm above it. The blood of the Kirin in her body dripped into the jar, making Zhang Qiling, who was already seriously injured, even weaker.
1:35:16|1:35:23|The group at Aiqin Apartment was deeply moved when they saw Zhang Qiling willing to sacrifice his life to guard the bronze door. They couldn't help but shed tears.
1:35:25|1:35:28|The blood of the Kirin has filled a porcelain jar.
1:35:28|1:35:34|Zhang Qiling's thin body seemed to have been drained of all strength, pale and unable to even stand up.
1:35:34|1:35:39|So, the heavy blade, soaked in the blood of the Kirin, fell on [Chen Meijia] who was wearing the protective spirit armor.
1:35:39|1:35:43|Chen Meijia walked towards the Guardian Armor with particular seriousness.
1:35:43|1:35:46|The hope of the whole village was accidentally dashed to the ground by [Chen Meijia].
1:35:46|1:35:48|At this moment, she looked at [Zhang Qiling] again.
1:35:59|1:36:2|[Hu Yifei] wields the demon-slaying sword, while [Tang Youyou] is equipped with a demon-hunting bow.
1:36:2|1:36:9|[Lu Ziqiao] is wearing defensive armor, while [Chen Meijia] and [Zhang Wei] each have left and right arm guards symbolizing magic and power.
1:36:9|1:36:16|While [Xu Xiaoxian] only got a skirt with no abilities, the person with the artifact destroyed the headquarters of the Yellow, Black, and Red again.
1:36:16|1:36:30|[Hu Yifei] appeared in front of the enemy in a grand manner. The special forces soldier did not dare to be careless, quickly hiding behind cover. Just as the special forces soldier was about to pull the trigger, [Hu Yifei] activated her special ability to bind arrows, instantly moving in front of the soldier and killing him.
1:36:30|1:36:36|Although [Hu Yifei] has the ability to teleport instantly, she still pauses in place at the moment of killing the enemy.
1:36:36|1:36:46|Just as [Hu Yifei] was joyfully killing the enemies, a bullet accurately shot towards [Hu Yifei]'s head. In this critical moment, a transparent barrier suddenly appeared in front of [Hu Yifei], allowing teammates to be protected behind this invincible shield.
1:37:3|1:37:10|At this moment, a sniper was preparing to ambush the two from behind. Just as he had aimed, he found his body slowly levitating in the air.
1:37:10|1:37:14|This ability is wielded by [Chen Meijia], who possesses the magical left arm.
1:37:14|1:37:19|The sniper was lifted up to several tens of meters by [Chen Meijia] and then thrown heavily. [Tang Youyou] quietly ran out from behind the group.
1:37:43|1:37:46|[Zeng Xiaoxian] lowered his head, looked at his skirt, and said helplessly.
1:37:48|1:38:2|At this moment, the soldier who had been thrown away stood up dizzily. [Xeng Xiaoxian] hurriedly picked up a brick from the ground and knocked him out. In just a few minutes, all the special forces were taken care of. A signalman picked up the phone in panic and called for help.
1:38:10|1:38:25|At this moment, Hu Yifei, Tang Youyou, and Lu Ziqiao arrived at the battlefield in the Jue Di Zhe No. 2.
1:38:25|1:38:36|Only to see the missile launcher behind the Terminator No. 2 quickly aiming at [Hu Yifei], who decided to confront it with superpowers. However, after the missile was launched, [Hu Yifei] instantly broke the bow and fled immediately.
1:38:38|1:39:2|Under the intense firepower suppression of Jue Di Zhe No. 2, even superpowers cannot confront it head-on. Several people were forced to take cover and dared not show themselves. At this moment, Wang Fatty picked up a machine gun that had fallen on the ground and counterattacked bravely. Just as No. 2 was about to grab him, [Zhang Qiling] appeared in time and pulled him aside.
1:39:8|1:39:17|Fatty, still unwilling to give up, crowded towards Decision Maker No. 2 with a grenade, the impact of the grenade causing him to involuntarily take two steps back.
1:39:17|1:39:27|[Zhang Wei] seized the opportunity to leap into the air, hovering above Decision Maker No. 2, then exerted all his strength towards the cockpit. However, this powerful blow prevented the mecha from falling apart.
1:39:27|1:39:33|Next, Number Two delivered a heavy iron fist, sending him flying into a pillar, but luckily [Chen Meijia] caught him steadily with her superpowers just in time.
1:39:35|1:39:41|Just as Chen Meijia was looking at Zhang Qiling's passing, the heartless Number Two's big foot came down heavily towards the two of them.
1:39:41|1:39:48|At this critical moment, Lu Ziqiao activated his armor ability and managed to withstand the impact of tens of tons of force.
1:39:48|1:39:57|Lu Ziqiao's strong protective desire brought out all the power of the armor, and the huge mechanical foot was slowly lifted up.
1:40:2|1:40:5|Each family helped the injured [Zhang Qiling] and walked towards the back.
1:40:5|1:40:9|After seeing everyone else leave, [Lu Ziqiao] couldn't hold on any longer and was heavily stepped on.
1:40:11|1:40:19|Ziqiao, who had just exerted all her strength, was too exhausted to stand up, and could only let the huge iron foot of the Number Two Terminator mercilessly trample on her.
1:40:19|1:40:27|Huang, Hei, and Hong saw that stomping did not cause serious harm to Lu Ziqiao in armor, so they threw him into the air and then sprayed him with a machine gun.
1:40:27|1:40:31|Ziqiao instinctively used a barrier to block the flying bullets.
1:40:31|1:40:42|But it's not over yet. Just then, the No. 2 Terminator suddenly jumped up and, with a mechanical claw, slammed [Chen Meijia] against the heavy artillery. One shot sent Ziqiao back to the ground, followed closely by several missiles.
1:40:42|1:40:48|Ziqiao lay on the ground, completely powerless to resist, witnessed all this with her own eyes by Chen Meijia, who hadn't gone far.
1:40:48|1:40:56|She watched as her beloved Qiling was cruelly abused in order to protect her, and the anger in her heart could no longer be contained.
1:40:56|1:40:59|Chen Meijia's eyes lit up, and her whole body trembled as she activated her superpowers.
1:41:7|1:41:10|This wave of attacks has severely damaged the mecha.
1:41:34|1:41:37|At the command of Hu Yifei, everyone launched their attacks.
1:41:37|1:41:40|[Zhang Wei] shot an arrow and threw a huge rock, knocking the mecha down to the ground.
1:41:40|1:41:45|Later, with the empowerment of [Chen Meijia]'s superpower, Yifei flew towards the mecha with the demon-slaying sword in hand.
1:41:45|1:41:49|In the air, Yifei's will also allows the sword to reveal its final form.
1:41:49|1:41:55|The originally one-meter-long treasure sword instantly spewed out raging flames, Wong Fei-hung panicked and fired at Yi Fei.
1:41:55|1:41:59|And at this moment, [Lu Ziqiao] used all her strength to activate the barrier to protect Yifei.
1:41:59|1:42:5|[Hu Yifei] lived up to expectations, delivering a full-force blow that directly cut through the mecha, but unfortunately, it did not harm Huang Heihong.
1:42:5|1:42:14|The mecha fist strikes again, pushing [Hu Yifei] back several meters. Unnoticed by Huang Heihong, [Hu Yifei] throws the sword towards Zhang Qiling behind the mecha as she flies out.
1:42:14|1:42:22|Being a spiritual protector, [Zhang Qiling] instantly established a spiritual connection with the sword upon receiving it, allowing the sword's power to be unleashed to the fullest.
1:42:22|1:42:26|Zhang Qiling swung down with all his might, and the iron arm of the No. 2 Terminator was instantly severed.
1:42:56|1:43:10|Surprisingly, in the ruins, the No. 2 Terminator automatically repaired itself and slowly stood up.
1:43:12|1:43:17|The group formed a battle formation ready to fight, but their bodies immediately turned into souls.
1:43:17|1:43:23|Wong Fei-hung threw Xie Wu to the ground, then lifted his foot again, ready to crush him.
1:43:26|1:43:34|Everyone rushed towards [Wu Xie], but even with the ability to activate the sword's teleportation, they couldn't rescue the unconscious [Wu Xie] from under the iron feet.
1:43:34|1:43:43|[Zeng Xiaoxian] knew this very well. Just as he was rapidly thinking of a solution in his mind, Decision Maker No. 1 brought the protagonist halo to [Zeng Xiaoxian].
1:43:43|1:43:49|He looked at the protagonist's halo and instantly recalled the adventures of the past few days, this was an adventure they shouldn't have been involved in.
1:43:49|1:43:52|At this moment, he unhesitatingly threw the protagonist halo towards [Wu Xie].
1:43:53|1:44:2|At the moment when Iron Foot was about to make contact with Wu Xie, a halo formed a barrier between the two in an instant, but the next second the halo was unexpectedly shattered by Iron Foot's step.
1:44:2|1:44:9|Huang Hei Hong lifted his foot triumphantly, intending to mock everyone, but unexpectedly, Wu Xie slowly climbed up from the ground beneath his feet.
1:44:31|1:44:35|Unexpectedly, [Wu Xie] stood up again and shook his head.
1:44:35|1:44:39|With each step of yellow, black, and red, [Wu Xie] stood up.
1:44:39|1:44:47|And every time [Wu Xie] stood up, he changed to a different style, looking more and more like he deserved a beating, which made Huang, Hei, Hong, and Ya itchy with anger.
1:44:47|1:44:54|Originally, the protagonist's halo was not shattered just now. Instead, under the pressure of gravity, the halo merged faster with [Wu Xie].
1:44:57|1:45:4|[Wu Xie] took the shotgun from Fatty, with the blessing of the halo, he shot the vital point of the golden armor without even looking.
1:45:4|1:45:9|Fatty quickly drew his gun upon seeing the situation.
1:45:27|1:45:29|[Xiao Xian] placed his hand on the iron ball.
1:45:31|1:45:36|[Hu Yifei] placed her hand on it half-believingly, and the iron ball unexpectedly increased in weight by one notch.
1:45:45|1:45:51|After listening to [Xeng Xiaoxian]'s words, everyone instantly understood his meaning and then placed their hands on Decision Maker No. 1 one after another.
1:45:51|1:46:0|With each additional person, Decision Maker No. 1's power increased, but when everyone's energy converged on Decision Maker No. 1, he unexpectedly emitted a dazzling light.
1:46:23|1:46:28|Decision Maker Number One detonated himself in the air with the will of everyone, sacrificing himself along with Huang, Hei, and Hong.
1:46:28|1:46:32|After the battle, the three members of the grave-robbing team, Hu Yifei, Tang Youyou, and Lu Ziqiao, supported each other and gathered together.
1:46:59|1:47:16|Wang [Fatty] said, supporting the two as they walked towards the cave entrance. But before they had taken a few steps, [Zhang Qiling] seemed to resonate strongly with a mysterious force. He suddenly stopped and turned back to look at the bronze door. Floating in front of the motionless door was a guardian spirit armor that seemed like a soul, but it was different from before.
1:47:16|1:47:19|He seemed to have gained a bit of vitality.
1:47:19|1:47:26|The next morning, the honking of cars woke up the bustling city of Shanghai, and the residents of the Love Apartment gathered in the hall as usual.
1:49:38|1:49:44|It also sets off the brilliance of the fireworks.
1:50:30|1:50:35|[Xiao Xian]â€™s late-night radio show may have almost no listeners, but [Hu Yifei] has always quietly paid attention to it.
1:50:35|1:50:48|Upon hearing the rare sweet words from [Xeng Xiaoxian], [Hu Yifei]'s heart as a woman in love suddenly felt chaotic, a genuine smile appeared on her face, and she happily danced, signaling that the long-awaited relationship between this couple is finally about to blossom.
1:50:50|1:50:53|The film ends here and we have to say goodbye to you. Thank you for listening.
1:50:53|1:50:59|At the end of the film, we will bring you the post-credits scene. Now let's talk about the post-credits scene.
1:50:59|1:51:3|The post-credits scene of this film is the conversations between several couples from "Love Apartment".
1:51:3|1:51:13|Except for [Zhang Wei] who doesn't have a partner, the others are [Hu Yifei] and [Xeng Xiaoxian], [Lu Ziqiao] and [Chen Meijia], as well as [Tang Youyou] and her boyfriend Guan Gu.
