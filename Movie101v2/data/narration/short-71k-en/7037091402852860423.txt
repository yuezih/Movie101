0:1:9|0:1:25|She skillfully pulled the handbrake to park the car at the door, then she picked up the cloth in front of the steering wheel, opened the door and got out of the car. [Zhou Qimiao] said as she opened the car door, [Miao's Dad] glanced up drowsily, then closed the car door heavily and fell back asleep.
0:1:25|0:1:36|[Zhou Qimiao], as if already accustomed to [Miao's Dad]'s laziness, lifted her leg and jumped onto the back of the truck, struggling to move the full fish barrel, and then lifted the barrel and placed it on the ground. At this time, the market was crowded with people buying things.
0:1:43|0:1:52|[Miao's Dad] impatiently scolds the woman blocking his way, then pushes his cart to his fish-selling stall, only to find it cluttered with someone else's belongings.
0:1:55|0:2:11|[Zhou Qimiao] looked at the foam box with "Rich and Fresh Fish" written on it, glanced angrily at the sign across the street with "Rich and Fresh Fish" written on it, while [Pork Guy] sharpened his knife on the side. Upon hearing the woman's words, [Pork Guy] looked confused at the pig head hanging nearby.
0:2:11|0:2:19|The other party saw that he was not moving at all, and gestured towards him. He cut a small piece with a knife and put it in a bag.
0:2:34|0:2:52|[Miao's Dad] shouted as he threw the foam box containing the rich and fresh fish packaging into the neighboring rich and fresh fish stall. The nearby stall owner was frightened and fled, while the onlookers started discussing animatedly.
0:3:28|0:3:47|At this moment, the customers in Fu Gui Market were all inexplicably driven away by the stall owners. [Miao's Dad] walked over to [Zhou Qimiao] and said, [Zhou Qimiao] turned around, only to see a man with curly hair swaggering in. The man stopped at the Fu Gui Fresh Fish stall, looked up at the fallen sign, and then questioned his sidekick.
0:4:6|0:4:13|The man with a fierce demeanor shook off [Miao's Dad]'s hand and stood in front of [Zhou Qimiao]. [Zhou Qimiao] lifted her head and met the man's fierce gaze directly. Then the man said,
0:4:16|0:4:34|[Zhou Qimiao] finished speaking, the man glared at her, bent down to pick up a white eel from the nearby water tank. Then he stood up straight and threw the white eel on the ground. [Zhou Qimiao] frowned as she watched this scene. The man took out 50 yuan from his pocket, then threw the money fiercely on the cutting board. [Zhou Qimiao] lowered her head and glanced at it, then she grabbed the white eel from the ground.
0:4:46|0:4:54|The tense standoff was interrupted by the arrival of a middle-aged man wearing glasses, followed by some henchmen.
0:5:20|0:5:34|After being scolded by Zhou Qimiao, the man looked up fiercely and stared at Ah Miao, Zhou Qimiao, who was standing opposite him. He then turned and patted Pork Guy's chest before walking to the side. He then walked to the other side and asked, then he wiped his face with his hand after being sprayed with saliva.
0:5:46|0:6:8|After Zhou Qimiao pushed the man away and walked out, the man gave him a disdainful look, then turned his gaze back to Zhou Qimiao at the stall with a cold and indifferent expression. As night fell over the deserted market, a faint light suddenly flickered in the dark alley. Two figures holding flashlights could be seen approaching, bending over as they walked. They stopped in front of Zhou Qimiao's stall, one of them holding a large hammer, ready to smash the circuit breaker on the wall.
0:6:8|0:6:18|[Pork Guy] waved his hand and threw it over, while the man dumped the garbage into Qimiao's stall and said to [Pork Guy],
0:6:28|0:6:32|[Pork Guy] couldn't resist the man's demands, so he had to turn around and do as he was told.
0:6:39|0:6:47|[Miao's Dad] walked up to Qimiao with his arm around a woman.
0:6:58|0:7:16|[Miao's Dad] lifted the plastic sheet, opened another compartment of the safe, took out some money from inside, and without looking back, Miao said. Helplessly, Miao watched her dad and the woman walk away, while [Pork Guy] frowned when he saw it.
0:7:22|0:7:37|[Pork Guy] watched as Qimiao, who was selling fish porridge on the roadside, remained silent. A customer stood up, handed her the money, and left. Qimiao then picked up the bowl and chopsticks to clean up. At that moment, [Pork Guy] quietly walked over from behind the car and greeted Qimiao.
0:7:56|0:8:10|The man cursed from the window across, then put down the blinds and walked away. [Pork Guy] awkwardly said, "Ah Miao nodded and handed out the fish porridge, forcing a smile." [Pork Guy] also stood there dumbly, smiling.
0:8:25|0:8:46|After receiving a response, [Pork Guy] left with a smile on his face. In the dimly lit street, only Zhou Qimiao was left tidying up the messy stall. She neatly leaned the tables and chairs against the roadside fence, then turned off the overhead light. Zhou Qimiao opened the car door and sat inside, frowning and tilting her tired neck. She then took the coat on the car seat to the other side, adjusted the pillow, and lay down.
0:8:46|0:8:58|The environment in the car was slightly cold, and she picked up the coat next to her and covered herself with it, then slowly closed her eyes. The next morning, the seafood market vendors filled the camp with foam boxes full of seafood, waiting for vendors to come and stock up.
0:9:17|0:9:27|[Fish Guy] looked at Qimiao in front of him with a face full of resentment. Qimiao pushed the small cart filled with fresh live fish and walked outside. The sidekick next to him muttered,
0:9:37|0:9:55|[Fish Guy] greeted others while walking towards the stalls. He saw [Zhou Qimiao]'s stall lit up and ready for business. Just as he was stunned, he then noticed his own stall filled with garbage. Angered, he marched towards his stall, looked down at the mess, and then quickly went inside to inspect. The electrical box was already broken into pieces at this point.
0:9:55|0:10:2|He took another step forward and accidentally stepped on a pile of dog poop. His sidekick next to him said,
0:10:22|0:10:28|Knowing that his wrongdoing has been exposed, [Fish Guy] glared fiercely at [Pork Guy], then immediately rushed over.
0:11:51|0:12:20|The child pointed backwards and ran away. [Zhou Qimiao] walked up with flowers in hand and said, then she gestured with the flowers in front of the two. [Pork Guy] stood awkwardly with his hands in his pockets, [Fish Guy] took the flowers ungraciously and threw them into [Pork Guy]'s arms. [Fish Guy] rolled his eyes at [Zhou Qimiao]'s back, raised his hand to comfort [Pork Guy]. [Pork Guy] impatiently shook off [Fish Guy]'s hand, holding back tears, [Fish Guy] also felt uneasy watching.
0:12:20|0:12:35|At noon that day, [Miao's Dad] brought [Qimiao] to the entrance of a coffee shop. After some thought, [Qimiao] said,
0:12:40|0:12:49|At this moment, one hand holding a spoon kept stirring the coffee on the table, followed by another hand appearing in the frame, making the same movement. [Zhou Qimiao] sat across from the man in the suit and asked actively.
0:13:11|0:13:31|The brief conversation ended, and the two fell into silence again, looking down at the coffee on the table. They both spoke their minds at the same time. [Zhou Qimiao] smiled and shyly lowered her head. She glanced up at the man in the suit who was full of smiles and said, at this moment, the man in the suit could not contain his inner joy.
0:14:1|0:14:15|That night, the top floor of Fugui Market was brightly lit, with four small round tables filled with people. Everyone gathered to celebrate the happy occasion of an elderly couple's sunset love. The two elders were dressed in wedding attire, their faces beaming with smiles. [Chicken Guy] turned to kiss [Cai Po] on the cheek, while [Miao's Dad] shamelessly kissed his old sweetheart next to him.
0:14:26|0:14:37|At this moment, [Pork Guy] suddenly raised his glass and drank it all, then he stood up and said, supporting [Fish Guy]'s shoulder and standing on the stool, shouting loudly,
0:14:40|0:14:47|The crowd sighed in unison as [Cai Po] helped the swaying [Chicken Guy] walk over to [Pork Guy].
0:15:16|0:15:18|[Pork Guy] finished speaking, smiled at [Zhou Qimiao], and then turned and walked away.
0:16:41|0:16:53|[Biscuit Guy] glanced at [Fish Guy] who was snatching flowers on the side, took out a box from the lower compartment and handed it to [Zhou Qimiao]. [Zhou Qimiao] pretended not to see it, turned and asked. Seeing no response from [Zhou Qimiao], [Fish Guy] snatched the box and squeezed the biscuits outwards.
0:16:56|0:17:4|[Zhou Qimiao] immediately followed [Fish Guy] to escape from this awkward place. The customers next to them kept urging, while [Biscuit Guy] behind could only watch them leave with wide eyes.
0:17:5|0:17:20|At this moment, everyone in Fugui Market is sitting on the rooftop eating biscuits. After the men finish eating, they struggle to stand up. Meanwhile, a child eating halfway suddenly clutches their stomach and says. Upon hearing this, a woman immediately puts down her biscuit and runs outside. Nearby, sitting [Miao's Dad] laboriously swallows the biscuit and says,
0:17:22|0:17:26|After he finished speaking, he stood up, and his girlfriend next to him also stood up. The two of them held hands and left.
0:17:26|0:17:30|Others also left the rooftop one by one, leaving only [Zhou Qimiao] and [Fish Guy] sitting there eating biscuits.
0:17:30|0:17:38|Fish Guy, who was too full to speak, patted Zhou Qimiao's leg, pointed to his pocket, and Zhou Qimiao set the biscuit aside, took out an envelope from his pocket, and opened it.
0:18:55|0:19:2|[Zhou Qimiao]'s attitude left [Fish Guy] speechless. He rolled his eyes at [Zhou Qimiao] and threw away the leftover pastry in his hand.
0:19:13|0:19:36|[Zhou Qimiao] didn't even look at what was in [Fish Guy]'s hand. She was chewing on a biscuit, turned her head to look into the distance, snatched the bracelet from [Fish Guy]'s hand and threatened him. At this moment, a 1998 calendar appeared in the scene with a fly resting on it. [Fish Guy] swatted the fly with a fly swatter. Nearby, the vendors were gathered playing cards. He walked over and said.
0:19:39|0:19:45|Miao sat on the side playing with makeup with other women, her hands already wearing the bracelet given by [Biscuit Guy].
0:19:58|0:20:5|Qimiao's pupils dilated as she listened, the smile fading from her face.
0:20:14|0:20:36|Zhou Qimiao was looking at herself in the mirror, then she put her index finger to her lips and awkwardly wiped it off. She pursed her lips and was admiring herself in the mirror when Fish Guy suddenly ran over and looked at her lips. Zhou Qimiao covered her mouth with a tissue and stood up to leave, but Fish Guy stopped her and kept laughing.
0:20:42|0:20:49|Fish Guy led the stall owners from Fugui Market into a large supermarket with great momentum. At that moment, the fruit stall owner stood still in the fruit section.
0:20:54|0:21:5|The vendor of [Pork Guy] slid to his knees in front of the meat counter, and [Fish Guy] saw the vegetable vendor running towards the vegetable area and immediately followed.
0:21:14|0:21:21|The scene shifts to the neatly arranged fresh fish in the freezer. Qimiao stands still, staring at the scene in front of her. The stall owner inside is wearing a mask while handling the fish. Suddenly, Fish Guy rushes over from a distance, pounces on one of the men, grabs his collar, and shouts.
0:21:34|0:21:41|[Fish Guy] gritted his teeth and walked out, standing in front of Cai Yu Yu, with the other stall owners following immediately.
0:21:55|0:22:18|Early the next morning, [Fish Guy] wearing a sanitary hat nailed the signboard with job assignments on the wall of the Fu Gui Market. As soon as he finished speaking, two rows of neatly arranged shopping carts parked by the wall. Customers who had been here before felt slightly uncomfortable as they entered the transformed Fu Gui Market. Various promotional slogans on the small stalls caught people's attention, and the stall owners were displaying fresh fruits on the cutting board.
0:22:56|0:23:10|The woman's face changed immediately after hearing that, she stared, bent down to take out the items she had just put into the shopping cart, while Qimiao smiled and greeted the others.
0:23:29|0:23:38|The woman casually took a bottle from the beer tower, only to have a stack of beers fall to the ground the next second. She looked around nervously, pushed her shopping cart and quickly left.
0:23:46|0:23:56|In this scene, a simple card reader appears. [Miao's Dad] inserts the card and swipes it forcefully, only to have the card fly out the next second. The woman impatiently takes out the money and throws it on the table.
0:24:4|0:24:11|[Miao's Dad] fell silent for a moment, then he walked to the door holding a woman's belongings and threw them on the ground.
0:25:23|0:25:32|Qimiao pours the prepared fish ingredients into the pot and stirs, then she flips the fried noodles in the iron pot next to her.
0:25:38|0:25:46|Qimiao put down the iron shovel in her hand and ran to the other side to scoop up the sesame paste. At this moment, [Fish Guy] appeared next to the stall, secretly watching Qimiao's busy figure with a hint of tenderness in his eyes.
0:25:52|0:26:6|Qimiao turned around and found [Fish Guy]. She hesitated for a moment, then went to get the fried noodles. [Fish Guy] saw that she completely ignored him, and helplessly pursed his lips. He then quietly opened Qimiao's password box, took out the notebook on top, glanced at Qimiao who was turning away, and opened it.
0:26:42|0:26:50|Fish Guy, who knew he was in the wrong, lowered his head and then walked up to Qimiao, who was busy working, and said.
0:26:53|0:26:58|[Fish Guy] looked helplessly at Qimiao who was still eating non-stop in front of him, then he pointed to the fish porridge in the pot.
0:27:10|0:27:18|Fish Guy's competitive spirit was aroused by Qimiao's words. He took the money out of his pocket and handed it to Qimiao unkindly.
0:27:43|0:27:52|Fish Guy, at a loss, could only stare blankly at the urban management in front of him. The next morning, he went to Pork Guy's house, where Pork Guy opened a beer and sat down, saying, "
0:28:2|0:28:10|[Fish Guy] opened the door, and saw Qimiao rushing in and asking, while [Pork Guy] chuckled and said,
0:28:50|0:29:2|[Fish Guy] pointed at Qimiao sitting on the sofa. Qimiao, unwilling to show weakness, turned her head to [Pork Guy] for help. [Pork Guy] glanced at her without saying a word, just helplessly spread his hands, then picked up a beer from the side to ease the awkward atmosphere.
0:29:2|0:29:8|Qimiao glared angrily at [Fish Guy], who stared back at her arrogantly with his head held high.
0:29:14|0:29:27|After Qimiao slammed the door and left, Pork Guy couldn't help but laugh at the scene in front of him. The next morning, on the misty street, Qimiao ran frantically in her rain boots, not even taking off her apron. Passersby watched as Qimiao sped past them.
0:29:27|0:29:35|Upon reaching the destination, she immediately opened the door and ran upstairs. In the hallway, two men waiting outside the door looked at Qimiao, who was ringing the doorbell, with confusion.
0:29:51|0:30:3|Miao looked up at [Fish Guy] standing beside her, who avoided eye contact and didn't dare to meet her gaze.
0:30:4|0:30:10|[Fish Guy] pushed Qimiao aside and walked over to pick up [Miao's Dad].
0:30:13|0:30:22|Shortly after, Zhou Qimiao walked alongside Fish Guy, who was carrying Miao's Dad on his back. Watching Fish Guy help out voluntarily, she didn't know what to say. Fish Guy struggled to carry Miao's Dad up the stairs, and then she said,
0:30:56|0:31:13|With [Miao's Dad] on his back finally shutting up, Miao looked at the now manly [Fish Guy] and couldn't help but smile. Both [Fish Guy] and [Miao's Dad] turned to look at Miao, feeling a bit overwhelmed by Miao's gratitude. Yet, for some reason, [Fish Guy] felt empowered. He carried [Miao's Dad] on his back and climbed the stairs once again.
0:31:18|0:31:32|After listening, Ah Miao took off the bracelet and handed it to him, saying, "[Fish Guy]" took it from her hand and said. "[Fish Guy]" moved the drink over and stood up.
0:32:23|0:32:32|At this moment, the two of them are no longer the enemies they used to be. They sit at the dining table teasing each other, their attitudes towards each other have changed. The camera gradually pulls back, shrinking the figures of the two talking in the room.
0:32:32|0:32:43|Through the window, you can see the mottled walls outside. With the broadcast sound of the changing day and night and the development of the era, the camera starts to rotate, then stops again at the window of [Fish Guy]'s room, and the camera slowly zooms in.
0:32:43|0:32:58|Until she passed through the window, [Zhou Qimiao] was seen inside the house, carrying a stack of comic books and walking towards the bookshelf. She struggled to hold the comic books in her hands, and then slowly placed them neatly on the shelf. At this moment, [Fish Guy] came in from outside and looked at the spotless room in front of him. He even began to doubt if he had walked into the wrong place.
0:33:0|0:33:6|[Zhou Qimiao] finished speaking and turned to walk into the kitchen. [Fish Guy] slowly walked in and looked at the clean floor and tidy sofa in front of him, then he shouted.
0:34:26|0:34:44|The saleswoman handed the purse to her with a stern face from the display case, and [Zhou Qimiao] happily took it and walked towards the mirror. As she walked, she stuffed money into the purse, then she tucked the purse into her jacket pocket. She stood up, smiled at the mirror, and then took out the purse from her pocket, looking like she was paying with money. The saleswoman next to her impatiently said.
0:37:8|0:37:15|Feeling something off about the man she was holding, she looked up and immediately pushed him away.
0:37:48|0:37:53|In the quiet and eerie late-night streets, [Fish Guy] was seen running towards Fugui Market as if he had gone mad.
0:37:53|0:38:1|At this moment, the lost and dejected [Zhou Qimiao] is wandering on the top floor of Fuguixu. When [Fish Guy] sees the appearance of [Zhou Qimiao], he quickly climbs up the stairs in three steps and two steps.
0:38:17|0:38:33|[Fish Guy] dared not provoke her, so he stood opposite and tried to persuade her. [Zhou Qimiao] looked at the man in front of her expressionlessly. Suddenly, [Zhou Qimiao] burst into laughter. The nearby [Fish Guy] widened his eyes in fear and looked at her. Then, [Zhou Qimiao] laughed heartily on the edge of the rooftop, causing [Fish Guy] to slowly move closer.
0:39:8|0:39:29|[Fish Guy] slapped her face hard, and the agitated [Zhou Qimiao] finally calmed down. She looked at the stunned [Zhou Qimiao] standing there like a lifeless ash. As [Fish Guy] lowered his hand and gasped for breath, [Zhou Qimiao] slowly raised her head. At this moment, the image of [Fish Guy] in her eyes went from blurry to clear. She looked down towards the ground in a daze, her eyes gradually filled with fear.
0:39:40|0:39:46|[Zhou Qimiao] clung to [Fish Guy], desperately trying to burrow into his arms. At that moment, [Fish Guy] also held her tightly, still needing to protect the girl in his arms.
0:39:56|0:40:10|The two of them sat hugging each other in place, with [Fish Guy] holding Ah Miao in his arms, a smile unconsciously appearing on his face. The next morning, [Fish Guy] sat on the sofa wrapping a small box with a newspaper.
0:40:12|0:40:23|The poster reads "Romance can be carefully cultivated, moved by the bits and pieces of life." Then he took another notebook and imitated Ah Miao to stick a sticky note on the cover, which reads: [Fish Guy] 32 years old, Miao 29 years old.
0:40:23|0:40:29|At this moment, Qimiao is sitting at home, she opens the safe and takes out a few hundred yuan, while [Miao's Dad] is lying on the sofa, grinning foolishly.
0:40:38|0:40:47|Miao threw the phone at her dad, but it rang again. She grabbed it and shouted,
0:41:3|0:41:15|Qimiao hung up the phone expressionlessly and walked away. Miao's Dad sighed and stood up from the sofa, then sat down next to Qimiao.
0:41:17|0:41:25|Miao put the luncheon meat symbolizing [Pork Guy] aside.
0:41:31|0:41:38|At this moment, Qimiao didn't rush to clear her name, but instead, she stared at the decoration symbolizing [Fish Guy] in front of her, lost in thought. Miao's Dad then picked up the decoration and threw it into the trash can.
0:42:21|0:42:44|At this moment, [Fish Guy] saw Qimiao wearing a dress, his mouth half open in surprise. [Fish Guy] looked at the unusually colored Qimiao, who kept looking at [Fish Guy] and [Pork Guy] staring at her. Then she quickly ran to the taxi, opened the door and got in. [Fish Guy] paid no attention to what [Pork Guy] was saying, he stared fixedly in the direction the taxi was leaving, feeling somewhat uneasy.
0:42:45|0:42:53|At this moment, Zhou Qimiao sat in a restaurant, fixing her hair through the reflection of the mirror. Then she turned around and saw the waiter approaching with a plate.
0:42:58|0:43:6|The waiter put down the tableware and turned to look for a mirror. Zhou Qimiao raised her hand to adjust her clothes, while Fish Guy was observing her from his car not far away.
0:43:15|0:43:23|The [Biscuit Guy] outside smiled and greeted her as he walked towards the shop, while [Fish Guy] mumbled something in his mouth upon seeing [Biscuit Guy].
0:44:1|0:44:17|Fish Guy, sitting in the car at this moment, looked puzzled at Zhou Qimiao chatting enthusiastically inside the house. After the conversation ended, Zhou Qimiao immediately went to the mall. Zhou Qimiao frowned and then pointed to a wallet in the display case, asking,
0:44:25|0:44:33|The saleswoman handed her the wallet with a cold face, and she looked at the wallet she didn't like in anger. Then [Zhou Qimiao] arrived at a restaurant.
0:45:0|0:45:14|He avoided eye contact with [Zhou Qimiao] and continued speaking. [Zhou Qimiao] nodded silently in response. [Zhou Qimiao] gave a simple reply and fell silent. Across from him, [Pork Guy] sipped his drink while looking at him.
0:45:14|0:45:22|At this moment, [Zhou Qimiao] was already distracted, with a cloud of worry on his face. [Pork Guy] also felt awkward staying any longer, so he put down his drink, looked around, and finally said to [Zhou Qimiao],
0:45:22|0:45:40|[Pork Guy] nodded at [Zhou Qimiao], relieved, and got up from the chair. [Zhou Qimiao] watched his departing figure, then quickly took out her phone from her pocket and dialed a number. Putting the phone to her ear, she said,
0:45:52|0:46:10|[Zhou Qimiao] responded with a sound and walked by the bookshelf, while [Fish Guy] was checking the mail on the side. Unable to bear it, she casually tidied up the randomly placed comic books. Suddenly, she stopped her actions, raised her eyes to the top of the inner wall of the bookshelf, holding a comic book in one hand and looking inside with her head down. After seeing what it was, her eyes widened more and more.
0:46:10|0:46:27|At this moment, [Fish Guy] held the found mail in his hand, quickly glanced back at [Zhou Qimiao], and then pretended to continue searching. Suddenly, the notebook that was pressed underneath appeared in front of him, with a sticky note stating that [Fish Guy] is 32 years old and [Zhou Qimiao] is 29 years old, which was particularly noticeable. [Zhou Qimiao] turned to look at [Fish Guy], then sneakily moved over to take the notebook down.
0:46:27|0:46:42|[Fish Guy] also found the box wrapped in a poster before, he held it in his hand and rubbed it happily. At this moment, [Zhou Qimiao] opened the first page of the notebook, and was even more surprised after seeing the content inside. It said, "Becoming a person worthy of marrying without looking for Afeng." [Fish Guy] walked over holding an envelope and said,
0:46:46|0:46:51|He grabbed Zhou Qimiao's arm and then reached out the hand behind his back, handing over the wrapped notebook.
0:47:9|0:47:18|[Fish Guy] smiled as he handed her the box. When Miao opened it, she found a brand new wallet inside. She looked up in confusion at [Fish Guy], who was now sheepishly grinning.
0:47:29|0:47:37|Seeing the smiling [Fish Guy], Qimiao walked over and took the notebook that was underneath. [Fish Guy] immediately stood up when he saw it, and then Qimiao walked over and handed him the notebook.
0:47:54|0:48:5|After he finished speaking, he looked at Qimiao with a smile, his eyes filled with anticipation. [Fish Guy] smiled awkwardly upon hearing this.
0:48:10|0:48:15|[Fish Guy] looked at Zhou Qimiao with a wandering gaze and remained silent. At this moment, Zhou Qimiao spoke again,
0:48:23|0:48:46|Watching [Fish Guy] with a look of disappointment on his face at this moment, Zhou Qimiao didn't know how to handle it. After hesitating for a long time, she said to [Fish Guy], Zhou Qimiao turned and left. [Fish Guy] took a few heavy steps forward, then suddenly Zhou Qimiao turned back and handed over the wallet in her hand. He looked at the wallet, waved his hand and said, Zhou Qimiao heard this and had to take the gift back.
0:48:47|0:49:2|Fish Guy, standing still, never had the courage to look in the direction where Zhou Qimiao left. He then lowered his head and looked at the notebook in his hand. Zhou Qimiao walked out of Fish Guy's room, leaning against the door with a vacant look in her eyes. Rejecting him ruthlessly may have hurt Fish Guy, but she didn't know how to make amends.
0:49:2|0:49:14|In the room, [Fish Guy] silently picked up the torn poster wrapping paper, then walked to the sofa and casually threw it on the coffee table. He sat on the sofa, looking around with a despondent expression, then lowered his head to open the notebook.
0:49:14|0:49:20|After seeing his own ridiculous message, he slammed the phone down hard. At this moment, the scene cuts to a table in the gambling den.
0:49:31|0:49:45|[Miao's Dad] placed the character tile in front of himself, picked up a tile and rubbed it with his thumb. Then he reached for another tile, looking tense with furrowed brows. He gazed at the tile in his hand with a distant look, glanced around at the people nearby, and immediately flipped the tile over.
0:50:0|0:50:12|In the deserted Fuqui Market, everyone gathered together, laughing, drinking, and playing games. [Miao's Dad] happily walked in, with his arm around Afeng's shoulder.
0:50:36|0:50:47|[Miao's Dad] stood up from his chair and pointed at him. Everyone around was stunned, and then a [Chicken Guy] and a [Fish Guy] were placed on the dining table.
0:50:50|0:50:58|[Miao's Dad] pointed, [Fish Guy] turned his head and said. Looking at the furious [Miao's Dad], no one dared to say a word. The child on the side spoke up,
0:51:7|0:51:16|[Fish Guy] kept his head down and didn't say anything, while [Miao's Dad] frowned and said,
0:51:29|0:51:35|In his memory, he picked up the ornament symbolizing [Fish Guy] and threw it into the trash can.
0:52:2|0:52:12|[Miao's Dad] loudly scolded [Fish Guy], the surroundings fell silent. [Fish Guy], looking at the stern expression of [Miao's Dad], closed his mouth. At this moment, blood started flowing from his nose again. [Miao's Dad] raised his hand and wiped it off.
0:52:31|0:52:35|Wiping the nosebleed with one hand, he walked into the fruit guy's stall.
0:52:39|0:52:50|The oranges rolled all over the floor, and the Fruit Guy impatiently shouted towards the stall, but there was no response from the other side. [Fish Guy] shouted again, but still no movement from the other side. Everyone's attention was focused on the fruit stall.
0:52:50|0:52:56|Without getting a response, he immediately put down the chopsticks in his hand and ran over, with everyone following suit. [Fish Guy] picked up [Miao's Dad] lying on the ground.
0:53:4|0:53:21|With blood dripping from his nose, [Miao's Dad] weakly calls out Qimiao's name. At that moment, Qimiao, who went out to buy beer, rushes out of the store. She runs straight across the road, causing the car behind her to honk and immediately hit the brakes. She then quickly runs into Fuguixu and, after turning a corner, sees her dad lying on the ground.
0:53:32|0:53:38|The next morning, a piercing doorbell rang.
0:53:41|0:53:50|[Fish Guy] opens the door, and [Miao's Dad] walks in immediately. [Miao's Dad] shakes off [Fish Guy]'s hand and strides confidently in front of [Zhou Qimiao], saying,
0:53:50|0:54:8|[Tuo Shu] took out the bill and looked at it. [Zhou Qimiao] took the bill with a puzzled look. [Tuo Shu] looked at the pitiful [Zhou Qimiao], wiped her nose, and then patted her shoulder, saying,
0:54:14|0:54:20|[Fish Guy] opened the door, [Miao's Dad] glanced at him and walked out. [Zhou Qimiao] sat on the sofa, looking down at the bill in her hand.
0:54:20|0:54:28|[Fish Guy] looked back and followed [Miao's Dad] out. [Zhou Qimiao] sighed deeply as she looked at the debt that had already been paid off. At that moment, [Fish Guy] coming down the stairs said
0:54:37|0:54:39|Uncle Tuo answered while walking downstairs.
0:54:39|0:54:59|In the room at this moment, [Zhou Qimiao] sat on the sofa, holding a compartmentalized safe box belonging to the father and daughter. She used a key to open the compartment belonging to [Miao's Dad], took out some miscellaneous items, and then pulled out an old, yellowed photo. It was a childhood photo of herself and [Dad], which she looked at for a while before setting it aside. Then [Zhou Qimiao] took out a thick stack of money bound by a rubber band from inside.
0:54:59|0:55:3|Next, he picked up the old radio next to him and pressed the play button.
0:55:3|0:55:18|Accompanied by a nursery rhyme, [Zhou Qimiao] once again recalled the day when [Miao's Dad] was lying on the ground with his mouth wide open, trying his best to say something.
0:55:21|0:55:41|[Zhou Qimiao] listened to the nursery rhyme, tears welling up in her eyes. She looked at the portrait of [Miao's Dad] on the table, feeling a sharp pain in her heart. Over the years, the father and daughter had experienced bitterness and tears in the days of repaying debts in poverty, but the memories were still unforgettable.
0:55:41|0:55:51|With her only relative gone, [Zhou Qimiao] now felt like a small boat adrift in the vast sea. She picked up her notebook filled with plans and flipped through every entry she had recorded.
0:55:51|0:56:2|Upon hearing the words "leave the market before turning 30," [Zhou Qimiao] couldn't help but smile bitterly. She then tore off the pages filled with plans, and threw them along with her previous notebook into the brazier, where the flames continued to burn.
0:56:2|0:56:8|Turn everything from the past into ashes. That night, [Fish Guy] accompanied [Zhou Qimiao] to play a game of bowling on the rooftop.
0:56:16|0:56:21|[Fish Guy] staggered over, picked up the watermelon next to him, and turned to look straight ahead.
0:56:39|0:56:45|[Fish Guy] picks up the fallen white radish while talking.
0:56:50|0:56:56|[Zhou Qimiao] smashed a big watermelon on [Fish Guy]'s waist. [Fish Guy] lay on the ground groaning as [Zhou Qimiao] walked over, bending at the waist.
0:57:15|0:57:35|[Fish Guy] placed [Zhou Qimiao] on the side of the roof, then dragged his heavy body towards the table full of beer. He picked up a bottle opener, but when he heard [Zhou Qimiao]'s crying, [Fish Guy] stopped his action and turned around. At that moment, [Zhou Qimiao] sat on the ground, crying with her head down. She knew that no matter how much alcohol she drank, it would be difficult to numb the pain of losing her loved one.
0:57:35|0:58:2|Fish Guy then slowly approached Zhou Qimiao, looking at the tearful girl with heartache. Faced with such vulnerability from Zhou Qimiao, he didn't know how to comfort her for a moment. He sighed, slowly reaching out his hands to hold her arms. Zhou Qimiao cried and repeatedly pushed away his embrace. Fish Guy angrily shouted. At this moment, Zhou Qimiao was completely unable to control the sadness in her heart, crying uncontrollably with her hair dampened by tears.
0:58:2|0:58:15|[Fish Guy] looked at [Zhou Qimiao] and regretted his impulsive actions earlier. He then raised his arms again and embraced [Zhou Qimiao], who this time did not resist. She leaned against [Fish Guy]'s shoulder and poured out her sadness freely in this warm embrace.
0:58:15|0:58:20|At night, the quiet sky echoed with the cries of [Zhou Qimiao], as [Fish Guy] held her, sharing her inner pain.
0:58:20|0:58:40|The next morning, the piercing sunlight shone through the cracks of the blinds. [Fish Guy] lay on the bed with his mouth half open, sound asleep. He still wore the bracelet that [Biscuit Guy] had given to [Zhou Qimiao]. Then [Fish Guy] rolled over and fell back into a deep slumber. Suddenly, a hand reached out from the other side of the bed and pulled the blanket, revealing [Zhou Qimiao] struggling to sit up, rubbing her still groggy head.
0:58:40|0:59:4|Qimiao sat on the bed and moved her sore neck a bit. She turned to look at Fish Guy, who was sleeping next to her, pursing his lips and revealing a childlike innocent smile. As she gazed at Fish Guy's face, Qimiao's expression turned extremely indifferent. Fish Guy always appeared when she needed company, but she was unsure about their future life. After staring for a long time, she was drawn to the bracelet on Fish Guy's wrist. It turned out that he had never lost it, but instead kept it with him.
0:59:4|0:59:15|Following that, Zhou Qimiao got out of bed and went to the bathroom, closing the door behind her. She walked wearily to the sink, ran her hand through her messy hair a few times, then tied it up. Looking at her face in the mirror, Zhou Qimiao fell into deep thought.
0:59:26|0:59:40|In the mirror, Zhou Qimiao's face gradually turned fierce, her eyes filled with pride and defiance, strengthening her disdain for the market and firming her resolve. The scene shifts to Fuguixu.
0:59:42|0:59:51|At this moment, the vendors in Fugui Market were getting ready to open for business. [Fish Guy] walked in with breakfast, smiling, but when he didn't see Qimiao around, he checked the time on his watch.
1:0:8|1:0:15|[Fish Guy] immediately arrived downstairs at Qimiao's house, he took out his phone and answered a call while walking.
1:0:17|1:0:40|[Fish Guy] knocked on the door but no one answered. He noticed that the security door was slightly ajar. He finally pulled it open and found a note stuck on the door lock core, saying "Landlady's key is on top of the iron gate." After seeing Miao's message, [Fish Guy] immediately took the key from the top of the iron gate, opened the door, and looked at the empty room. He stood there in shock.
1:0:40|1:1:0|He slowly moved his feet into the room, [Fish Guy] glanced at the kitchen unwillingly, then walked into Qimiao's bedroom. The empty house told him the undeniable fact that Qimiao's sudden disappearance hit [Fish Guy] hard. He turned around and looked at the lonely furniture, then immediately took out his phone to make a call, putting it to his ear.
1:1:0|1:1:22|The voice of the machine announcing the suspension of service echoed in his ears again, [Fish Guy] realized that Qimiao had indeed left. He slowly put down his phone, stood still in place for a long time, looking at the hazy sky outside the window. Then he took a few steps forward towards the window, and the distant street became clearer, but he did not see that familiar figure.
1:1:22|1:1:25|[Fish Guy] stood alone by the window, his silhouette lonely and desolate.
1:1:25|1:1:34|At this moment, Zhou Qimiao appears on the screen with her eyes closed.
1:1:47|1:2:17|Makeup artist casually tugs at the skin of [Zhou Qimiao], who remains expressionless as a makeup model. [Fish Guy] refuses to answer, instead lowering his head to clean the road with a water gun. His partner, seeing him silent, picks up something and walks away, but [Fish Guy] still has no mood to respond. He focuses on using the water gun to clean the ground of the Fuk Hing Estate. At this moment, [Fish Guy] can only use temporary busyness to escape his bad mood, and can only use the cleaning time to reminisce about the days spent with [Zhou Qimiao].
1:2:17|1:2:28|The once bustling Fugui Market is now deserted, with [Fish Guy] standing in place looking up at the adjacent shops. He then shuts off the water gun and places it weakly by his side. On the other side, Zhou Qimiao's makeup artist turns around and says,
1:2:33|1:2:42|[Zhou Qimiao] sat in the front with a delicate makeup on her face, smiling and trying her best to show her best side.
1:2:42|1:3:11|At this moment, the cleaned up [Fish Guy] approached the coat rack, took out his phone from the pocket of the hanging cotton jacket, and dialed the familiar number again. He hesitated while looking at the phone, then raised his hand to his ear. The mechanical female voice on the phone remained unchanged. [Fish Guy] closed his eyes in pain and leaned against the wall. At this moment, he was filled with anxiety and helplessness. The beep sound on the phone kept ringing, but [Fish Guy] refused to put down the phone from his ear.
1:3:11|1:3:16|The feeling of going from anticipation to disappointment made him feel unbearable.
1:3:17|1:3:24|He took a deep breath while holding his phone, and said again, "[Fish Guy]" with his mouth tightly controlled to restrain his emotions.
1:3:24|1:3:40|Shortly after, she slowly opened her eyes. At that moment, the makeup artist was applying makeup to the beautiful actress who was getting ready. [Zhou Qimiao] was on the side, assisting and learning. She handed over a brush, and the actress looked at the clumsy [Zhou Qimiao] with a displeased expression on her face.
1:4:0|1:4:12|Amidst the sound of firecrackers, [Zhou Qimiao] joyfully celebrates the New Year with the makeup team, while fireworks on TV burst into different shapes. Meanwhile, [Fish Guy] is all alone on the rooftop of Fuguixu, lying on the ping pong table placed above.
1:4:12|1:4:23|Holding a ping pong ball in his hand, rolling it back and forth on his stomach, his eyes staring straight at the pitch-black sky, he didn't know if [Zhou Qimiao] would show up, or if this wait would once again end in disappointment.
1:4:23|1:4:26|The next morning, the entrance of Fugui Market was crowded with people.
1:4:33|1:4:41|[Pork Guy] learned about [Fish Guy]'s situation and hurried over.
1:4:51|1:5:6|In the Riches Market, [Fish Guy] is surrounded by several police officers, and [Pork Guy] walks in. The [Fish Guy] on the other side seems not to have heard, holding a knife to cut fish.
1:5:23|1:5:32|Fish Guy still didn't respond, nonchalantly picking up another fish. The officer looked at the abundance of fish on Fish Guy's stall, looking shocked.
1:5:40|1:5:49|At this moment, Fish Guy's hand tightly grips the cleaver. A police officer takes the knife from his hand, while the other two officers immediately grab Fish Guy's arms and drag him out.
1:6:1|1:6:23|[Fish Guy] was carried into the police car by several officers. The stall owners at the Fu Gui Market rushed over to inquire about his condition. With the sound of seagulls in the background, the scene shifted to a tranquil fishing ground. In the distance, some scattered buildings could be seen on the sea surface. A person was standing on a boat, pulling up a fishing net with both hands.
1:6:23|1:6:43|The scene shows a net full of lively fish, as the camera gradually moves up, [Fish Guy]'s face appears in the frame. He is wearing water shoes and an apron, exerting effort to pull up the fishing net. Walking to a water bucket on the shore, he picks up a fish basket and pours the fish from the net into the bucket. Looking at the large and plump fresh fish in front of him, [Fish Guy] shows a satisfied smile. Then he speeds off on his fishing boat.
1:6:43|1:6:52|The sun shines on him, and the lake sparkles. At this moment, a group of actors in performance costumes appear in the scene, rehearsing dance in front of the mirror.
1:6:52|1:7:1|Sitting in front of the dressing table, the actress looked satisfied with her makeup. Beside her was the skilled makeup artist [Zhou Qimiao], when suddenly the director approached.
1:7:24|1:7:29|On the computer desktop, the name of [Fish Guy] appears, and the granddaughter opens the email.
1:7:47|1:7:55|At this moment, [Zhou Qimiao] walked into a restaurant.
1:9:8|1:9:17|After saying that, he grinned and looked at [Zhou Qimiao]. The scene shifted, with [Fish Guy] carefully holding a plate with one hand and ladling porridge with a spoon with the other.
1:9:30|1:9:37|[Chicken Guy] and [Cai Po] are smiling as they read the email reply from [Fish Guy].
1:9:54|1:10:2|Pork Guy picked up the mirror on the table and said.
1:10:12|1:10:24|After saying that, he pursed his lips. The assistant walked over and said, [Pork Guy] responded, then turned to look at [Zhou Qimiao], and got up to walk to the filming location. [Zhou Qimiao] sat in her original seat, lost in thought.
1:10:36|1:10:47|[Pork Guy] recites a passionate and stirring advertisement in front of a luxury car. Several months later, [Zhou Qimiao] drives a new car onto the street while wearing a mask. As she reaches an intersection, she stops the car and waits for the traffic light.
1:10:47|1:11:9|As she watched the passing pedestrians, a familiar figure caught her eye. [Zhou Qimiao] couldn't believe her eyes as she stood up from her seat to get a closer look at the man wearing a mask. Her eyes widened as the masked [Fish Guy] hurriedly crossed the street. Her gaze followed this familiar figure closely, her hands gripping the steering wheel tightly, feeling nervous. Seeing [Fish Guy] about to walk away, she pressed the horn hard.
1:11:13|1:11:25|[Zhou Qimiao] anxiously lowered the car window and stuck her head out to watch [Fish Guy] walking away. Just then, the green light came on, and the cars behind started honking incessantly. [Fish Guy] crossed the street and got into a taxi on the other side, [Zhou Qimiao] watched him leave before finally starting the car.
1:11:25|1:11:29|After the car passed the intersection, [Zhou Qimiao] was still looking back in the direction where [Fish Guy] had left.
1:11:29|1:11:38|She then took out her phone while holding the steering wheel, [Zhou Qimiao] glanced at the phone and pressed the quick search button, while keeping an eye on the road ahead. Suddenly, a woman with a backpack walked out.
1:11:38|1:11:48|The woman was scared and fell to the ground. [Zhou Qimiao] immediately unbuckled her seatbelt and got out of the car to check. She ran over and asked, the woman's legs were covered in bruises, [Zhou Qimiao] said worriedly.
1:12:12|1:12:20|Fish Guy stared at him with wide eyes after hearing that, at this moment, Ah Miao's car appeared at the door of the shop, with the woman who had almost been hit sitting in the passenger seat.
1:12:21|1:12:27|The car slowly came to a stop, and the woman said to [Zhou Qimiao].
1:12:30|1:12:42|[Zhou Qimiao] watched as she closed the car door, then started the car. Hearing the sound of the engine starting, [Fish Guy] turned around and saw [Zhou Qimiao] wearing a mask. He widened his eyes and followed the direction the car was driving, then furrowed his brow, thought for a moment, and turned away.
1:14:8|1:14:30|At this moment, a bus with a broken windshield was parked diagonally by the roadside. A man was complaining as he got out of the bus, followed by a woman carrying a crying child. Other passengers also got off the bus one after another. A white car next to it had collided with the rear wheel of the bus. Inside the car was [Zhou Qimiao], who was still in shock. At that moment, a police officer approached the car window and asked.
1:14:49|1:14:58|[Zhou Qimiao] sat on the roadside listening to the sounds of people making phone calls around her. She picked up her phone and looked at it, only to realize that she had no one to talk to. She slowly put down the hand holding the phone, while the other hand supported her face.
1:14:58|1:15:3|Then he looked into the distance with a desolate expression on his face. [Zhou Qimiao] picked up his phone and opened an email.
1:15:5|1:15:8|On the screen, it reads: "I am [Fish Guy], who are you?"
1:15:8|1:15:26|The short message made [Zhou Qimiao] panic for a moment. Her hand holding the phone trembled slightly. At her most helpless moment, this brief greeting felt like a warm stream flowing into her heart. She hesitated as she looked up, but after a while of inner struggle, she suddenly smiled as if she had figured something out. Several hours later, a taxi swiftly shuttled through the middle of the road.
1:15:26|1:15:38|Ahead is the scene of the accident, where the police have placed barriers in the middle to warn passing vehicles. [Fish Guy] sits in the back seat of the taxi, looking worried as he watches the scene of the crash. He unbuckles his seatbelt and moves to the other side of the seat, looking through the glass for the figure of [Zhou Qimiao].
1:15:38|1:15:43|The driver got out of the car immediately after parking and asked the traffic policeman standing nearby.
1:15:56|1:16:14|[Fish Guy] was reproaching Zhou Qimiao with a hint of blame, his eyes filled with worry. Zhou Qimiao, with slightly reddened eyes, looked at him without saying a word. Fish Guy could see all her emotions and how much he cared in her eyes. Seeing Zhou Qimiao's teary eyes, Fish Guy's impatient expression gradually softened. Uncomfortably, he averted his gaze and lowered his head, while Zhou Qimiao also turned her head away and stopped looking at him.
1:16:14|1:16:21|[Fish Guy] suddenly stood up and walked towards the damaged car. He opened the door and started searching around the driver's seat.
1:16:21|1:16:37|After a while, he got off the car and looked into the back seat. He bent down to look inside the car, then quickly walked a few steps towards the front of the car. He then leaned down to pick up the shoes that had fallen on the ground, and struggled to stand up before walking over with the shoes.
1:16:55|1:17:6|Miao looked at the drawings in front of her without saying a word. The scene then shifted to the abandoned Fu Gui Market, where a pair of pliers was clamping the chain on the door. The person violently opening the door was [Fish Guy].
1:17:15|1:17:20|On the dirty floor lay the position chart from the once prosperous Richville. Zhou Qimiao picked it up and laughed.
1:17:23|1:17:33|Fish Guy walked behind Zhou Qimiao, looking at the peeling job list. Seeing Zhou Qimiao's confident expression, he asked incredulously.
1:18:23|1:18:29|Once again, Zhou Qimiao effortlessly lifted the fish crate, showcasing her expertise. Beside her, Fish Guy couldn't help but smile at the scene.
1:18:29|1:18:36|The familiar feeling made the two of them feel happy, and then they pushed the small cart filled with fish tanks together, walking out contentedly.
1:18:56|1:19:5|As usual, everyone arranged the fruits on the stall, while the child stood beside not knowing what to do. Under the influence of the irritable mother, the child sat on the bench seemingly understanding but not really.
1:19:5|1:19:17|Finally, she took out a pen from her backpack and started doing her homework. The vendor next to her bent over, holding a water kettle and sprinkling water on the ground. [Fish Guy], wearing an apron, placed the pot of fish porridge against the wall, while Qimiao smiled at the porridge pot that had accompanied her throughout her youth.
1:19:17|1:19:21|The days in Fugui Market were the hardest and most unforgettable days for her.
1:19:21|1:19:27|Thanks to Chicken Guy, Zhou Qimiao also benefited and was able to return to this place full of friendship.
1:19:27|1:19:43|Fish Guy then walked into the stall, while Zhou Qimiao craned her neck to look inside. She saw Fish Guy gritting his teeth, carrying a full box of fresh live fish. He smiled as he slowly put down the fish box and then placed the oxygen tube into the water. Next, Fish Guy stood up straight and took down the calendar from the wall.
1:19:46|1:19:52|[Zhou Qimiao] smiled at [Fish Guy], then shook her head. They then stood on either side of a wall, facing a mirror, and started fixing their hair.
1:19:52|1:19:57|[Fish Guy]'s hair was covered in plastic curlers, making him look like a landlady.
1:19:57|1:20:15|[Zhou Qimiao] is on the other side of the wall, skillfully catching a wig with her bare hands. A few minutes later, [Fish Guy] pulls off the curling iron, looking at his rejuvenated self in the mirror, he smiles with satisfaction. At this moment, [Zhou Qimiao] is also ready, looking at the familiar explosion hairstyle of [Fish Guy], she covers her mouth and laughs. Meanwhile, the lights in the Fu Gui Market light up one by one.
1:20:15|1:20:21|Everyone gathered together preparing for the upcoming task, as [Miao's Dad] walked in with a smile on his face.
1:20:44|1:20:58|[Feng] gasped as she reported the news to everyone, at this moment [Cai Po] helped [Biscuit Guy] walk in, everyone lowered their heads not knowing how to explain.
1:21:3|1:21:15|Everyone looked at the woman in confusion. [Cai Po] pushed aside [Chicken Guy] who was blocking the road, muttering under her breath. At this moment, everyone stood still in astonishment.
1:21:17|1:21:22|Everyone returned to their stalls, and at this moment, the bustling atmosphere of Fugui Market was restored.
1:22:3|1:22:10|Qimiao looked in the direction she pointed, only to see Fish Guy smiling and pointing at Chicken Guy in front of him.
1:23:10|1:23:32|Outside, surrounded by reporters, Officer Ah Xiong walked out first. Behind him, the vendors of Fu Gui Market stood hand in hand in front of the door. Then Officer Ah Xiong turned around and looked at [Chicken Guy]. Hearing [Chicken Guy] calling him, Officer Ah Xiong walked over. At this moment, [Chicken Guy] solemnly took a camera out of his pocket and handed it to him.
1:23:47|1:24:5|Everyone looked down at the camera below, at this moment, [Pork Guy] raised his hand in a salute gesture. [Fish Guy] and Miao followed suit, and people around them began to imitate one after another. For these stall owners, Fortune Market is not just a market, but an experience and change of a generation. The well-intentioned lie also fulfilled [Chicken Guy]'s dream.
1:24:5|1:24:10|In this scene, a blueprint of the Fish Porridge King appears, with [Fish Guy] sitting in front of the mirror.
1:24:51|1:25:10|Miao smiled awkwardly and then walked over to the sofa inside. She picked up the messenger bag next to her and took out the wallet that Fish Guy had given her earlier. At that moment, Fish Guy's phone suddenly rang. Miao looked at Fish Guy in confusion as he took out his phone. Fish Guy stood up and said in an indulgent tone.
1:25:13|1:25:18|Miao stood up and looked at [Fish Guy], unable to believe her ears, standing there dumbfounded.
1:25:30|1:25:43|Seeing Qimiao's strong reaction, [Fish Guy] reached his hand behind her and grabbed the side of the wallet. The familiar touch made him stop his action and his face turned awkward. At this moment, Qimiao stared ahead expressionlessly, making [Fish Guy] feel her unusualness, so he dared not speak again.
1:25:43|1:25:47|Standing still, Zhou Qimiao's eyes were dull and lifeless. She slowly turned her head to look at [Fish Guy] and said,
1:25:51|1:26:1|Miao looked at Fish Guy in front of her with no ripples in her heart. Miao's expression said it all. Fish Guy looked at her steadily, his eyes inexplicably moist. Fish Guy stood up and said,
1:26:13|1:26:27|Miao sighed softly as she turned to look at the back of [Fish Guy], then gently placed the wallet she was carrying behind her. Her hands continued to caress the surface of the wallet, and then a square camera appeared in the frame. [Fish Guy] was wearing clown makeup and a chef's hat.
1:26:29|1:26:36|[Fish Guy] squeezed out a smile with great effort, freezing time in this moment.
1:26:50|1:26:57|Zhou Qimiao's eyes followed his figure all the time, then he turned around and waved to Zhou Qimiao with a smile.
1:26:57|1:27:1|The woman also smiled and nodded at Zhou Qimiao.
1:27:10|1:27:22|Amiao looked at the happy smile of [Fish Guy] and the harmonious scene of their family of three, with a hint of envy in her eyes. Seeing how content [Fish Guy] is now, Amiao also felt relieved. She smiled, turned around, and went back to her own makeup shop.
1:27:23|1:27:30|The scene shifts to Fugui Market, where several construction workers wearing helmets are working at the entrance. At this moment, a car slowly pulls over to the side of the road, and sitting in the car is Zhou Qimiao.
1:27:44|1:27:52|Qimiao's gaze lingered for a moment, then she started the car and drove away gracefully.
1:27:52|1:27:58|Next to them, the construction workers were still busy, time passed, and the past eventually became history. On this day,
