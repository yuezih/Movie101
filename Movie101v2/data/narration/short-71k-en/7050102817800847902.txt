0:1:24|0:1:32|His rough fingers reached out to touch the scars, each scar telling a story of the hardships of survival.
0:1:34|0:1:58|Not far from the great river, a group of people with bare upper bodies and wearing animal skins are performing a special ritual. Behind them stands a tall altar, this is the [You Xiong Tribe]. The [You Xiong Tribe] is a clan in the ancient Huaxia tribes. Due to scarce resources at that time, there was competition between tribes, so each tribe was far apart, even separated by a river. Each tribe had its own unique skills. In order to survive, tribes could exchange items with each other to obtain necessities of life.
0:1:58|0:2:10|[Youxiong Tribe] is skilled in making ceramics. On this day, in order to exchange essential goods with other tribes across the river, the tribal leader selected a few brave tribe members to go to the other side of the river to trade salt with [Shennong Tribe].
0:2:10|0:2:15|The wide river water is murky, with angry waves constantly churning. This place has seen the deaths of countless people.
0:2:15|0:2:32|To cross the river, one can only rely on luck. In order to bless someone to cross the river this time, the tribe members performed an ancient ritual. They knelt on the ground, hands raised up, and then began to kowtow. [Emperor] tribe leader held a scepter and waved it continuously towards the sky, repeating this action endlessly.
0:2:32|0:2:53|At this moment, six people carried a wooden raft made of an inflatable skin into the crowd. The raft was covered with flowers, and a woman on the raft wearing a flower crown sat cross-legged, raising her hands high and singing an ancient folk song. The people carrying the raft then slowly walked towards the riverbank, their feet covered in damp mud. When they reached the shore, they raised their hands and threw the raft into the river.
0:2:53|0:3:3|The woman on the raft remained calm as it was tossed around in the water, but when the raging waves overturned the raft, she was submerged in an instant.
0:3:3|0:3:12|[Yǒu Xióngshì] tribe leader looked up at the sky.
0:3:15|0:3:29|The clan leader shouted a special slogan, followed by the young people passing through the kneeling tribesmen, holding inflatable skins in their hands and rushing towards the river. Among them, [Ji Di] took the lead, his eyes firm, shouting slogans to boost his courage, and then jumped into the river without hesitation.
0:3:29|0:3:51|At this moment, [Meng], a woman from the [Youxiong] tribe, ran over from a distance. She knelt on the ground, anxiously watching the young man crossing the river. The clear river water splashed violently, and after struggling for a while, the young man gradually lost his strength. Even the life-saving skin bag began to escape in all directions. Without the protection of the skin bag, the young men were instantly submerged by the river water. [Meng] couldn't help but feel anxious, folding her hands together and silently praying.
0:3:54|0:4:6|At this moment, [Jidi] struggled to come out of the water with the skin bag in her arms. As she took a deep breath and turned to look at the others, she noticed the whirlpool in the water, quickly pulling several tribe members into the riverbed. [Momu] hurriedly knelt on the ground, afraid that her distraction might anger the gods.
0:4:6|0:4:34|When he looked up, the turbulent water surface was empty except for a few inflatable skins. Suddenly, [Jidi] emerged from the water. At this point, he was the only survivor as his life-saving skin was washed away. [Jidi] took deep breaths and swam quickly to the other side of the river. [Momu] knelt down again, then looked up to see no one in the river, only a few scattered skins. She stood up slowly, kept looking across the river, and suddenly smiled.
0:4:38|0:4:43|The tribe members were amazed, they quickly stood up and looked across the river, [Mother Mo] excitedly ran a few steps forward.
0:4:43|0:4:46|He watched as [Jidi] was about to come ashore, shouting loudly,
0:4:56|0:5:7|The clan leader gasped for breath, finally letting go of the suspended heart. Joyful [Mother Mo] called his name over and over again, [Ji Di] climbed ashore and turned to look at the people on the opposite bank. He raised his hands and shouted.
0:5:13|0:5:18|The tribespeople were instantly ecstatic, dancing with joy, knowing that crossing the river would enable them to exchange for essential goods for their livelihood.
0:5:18|0:5:33|In their eyes, this is the hope of survival. After narrowly escaping death, [Jidi] slowly regained consciousness, gasping for breath, then slowly knelt on the ground. The tribal leader raised his scepter in gratitude, and [Jidi] also raised his hand, then bowed deeply to [Huangdi].
0:5:33|0:5:41|At this moment, the sky was flashing with thunder and lightning, as lines converged to form four majestic characters, depicting the name of the character [Xuanyuan the Great].
0:5:41|0:5:58|[Jidi] arrived at the Shen Nong tribe bare-chested and carrying a weapon on his back. The atmosphere here was peaceful, with male tribe members working together in the fields with farming tools, while female tribe members held a pot of seeds, sprinkling a few into the soil with their hands and then stomping on them with their feet.
0:6:3|0:6:18|[Jidi] looked up at the people planting the fields, then looked down at the land, picked up some moist soil, examined it repeatedly in his hand. The other tribe members were busy making salt, and the finished salt caught [Jidi]'s attention. He grabbed a handful and put it in his mouth.
0:6:35|0:6:43|The local tribespeople walked up to [Jidi]. One of them picked up a basin and scooped a basin full of salt.
0:6:44|0:6:53|The tribespeople felt somewhat puzzled, he glanced at [Jidi], then bent down to take the item that [Jidi] had put down.
0:6:55|0:7:1|[Jidi] finished exchanging the salt and arrived at the local market, where the dazzling array of goods made him feel incredibly fresh.
0:7:1|0:7:24|In the market, there are daily necessities and emerald-like gems brought back by the fur-hunting hunters, with deer heads and cow heads as specimens displayed in a disorderly manner, attracting special attention. The wandering tribes carefully select goods on the wooden tower, with cow head specimens hanging above, and two farming tools crossed at the top, which is the symbol of the Shenong tribe. The women in the tribe are also busy.
0:7:24|0:7:31|They lined up, holding winding sticks to create neat rows of lines, then interweaving the lines in a crisscross pattern.
0:7:31|0:7:39|The men worked in pairs to make pottery, with one shaping the clay and the other spinning the wheel. At the same time, a tribe member bit grains into a bowl.
0:7:45|0:7:51|The woman with long hair placed the bowl on a wooden stump, while Zuyé washed his hands to the side. It turned out that Zuyé was the leader of the Shen Nong tribe, [Jiang Yan].
0:7:51|0:7:58|[Ji Di] walked through the crowd towards him. Seeing a stranger approaching, [Jiang Yan] stood up warily with a bowl in his hand.
0:8:5|0:8:12|[Ji Di] stared straight at the rice in [Jiang Yan]'s hand.
0:8:15|0:8:25|He had long been starving and ate without any reservation. The well-fed tribesmen were playing with stones by the river, unaware of the impending danger. In the nearby forest, only a few figures in animal skins could be seen.
0:8:25|0:8:37|The mysterious figure with a thin bone structure slowly approached them, walking through the dense mountain forest with light footsteps, afraid of alarming the local tribespeople. The tribespeople were completely unaware, continuing to work with laughter and chatter.
0:8:37|0:8:59|The mysterious figure held sharp weapons such as long knives and axes, ready to make a move. The leader had five stripes painted on his face, with a fierce look in his eyes as he stared intently at the river. Suddenly, he gave a signal with his eyes, and at that moment, other hidden mysterious figures slowly emerged from the water. The figures in the forest slowly raised their weapons, following the leader's signal.
0:8:59|0:9:2|The people lying in ambush in the river leaped out of the water like ghosts.
0:9:2|0:9:13|When [Shennong] working by the shore saw these people, it was already too late. The women weaving by the river heard the noise and looked around in panic, as the mysterious figures all rushed out with weapons, launching a fierce attack.
0:9:14|0:9:38|The enemy attacked, the man with long hair pushed away his companion with force, and the next second he was stabbed to death by the enemy. Seeing this, the scene became even more chaotic and restless. The mysterious man searched every corner like a wild beast, crazily killing. The tribesmen protected the elder [Jiang Yan] and quickly fled. [Ji Di], who was still eating, looked bewildered at everything. The mysterious man overturned the shelves blocking the way, and the ceramics poured out all over the ground. Some of the tribesmen helped [Jiang Yan] escape, while others...
0:9:38|0:10:2|Desperately resisting, at this moment [Jidi] was squatting next to the shelf holding a pottery jar. When the mysterious person approached, he suddenly flew the jar back into his hands and fiercely smashed it towards the mysterious person. The tribesmen who couldn't escape were stabbed by the enemy, and blood gushed out instantly. The excited enemy picked up a real hammer and crazily smashed the tribesmen. The tribesman who was moved was thrown off the high platform by the enemy, who then jumped down and relentlessly hammered for less than a quarter of an hour, [Shennong] was defeated and fled.
0:10:2|0:10:13|The fearful screams echoed in the air, mingling with the cold sound of weapons. Bodies littered the ground as the mysterious leader swaggered into the tribe, looking around in an attempt to retrieve some spoils.
0:10:13|0:10:20|Suddenly he stopped in his tracks, picked up the loom on the ground and examined it up and down, then fiercely threw it on the ground. On the other side
0:10:20|0:10:35|The tribesman who narrowly escaped death supported the elderly tribal leader [Jiang Yan] and ran into the mountains. Not far away, a group of people was waiting for them. When they saw [Jiang Yan], they immediately ran to greet him and helped the injured tribesman. [Jiang Yan] was supported to sit on a stone stool, panting heavily after the long journey.
0:11:0|0:11:6|[Jiang Yan] looked over, his eyes widened in fear, and he stood up unsteadily with the help of a cane.
0:11:6|0:11:14|A burly man with a horned helmet, thick eyebrows, and big eyes slowly approaches while carrying a long-handled stone axe, his eyes filled with murderous intent.
0:11:14|0:11:31|The just escaped tribesmen were so frightened that their lips turned white, breathing heavily. They raised their weapons in front of their chests, preparing for battle, but their bodies kept retreating in fear. It turned out that the burly man was none other than Chi You, a member of the Jiuli tribe, and the mysterious invaders of the Shennong clan were all Jiuli tribesmen.
0:11:31|0:11:40|At this moment, a member of the Shen Nong clan bravely shouted and ran towards [Chi You] with a weapon in hand. With a powerful kick, [Chi You] made the clan member collapse instantly.
0:11:40|0:11:49|The companion, seeing the situation, raised a stone axe to help. [Chiyou], calm and collected, grabbed the long-handled stone axe and fiercely smashed it into his waist. As he fell to the ground, he struggled to get up and once again challenged [Chiyou]. [Chiyou] ruthlessly chopped towards his neck.
0:11:52|0:12:3|Blood gushed out instantly, and another member of the tribe, in retaliation, picked up a weapon without hesitation and struck at [Chiyou]'s arm. Surprisingly, [Chiyou] was unharmed, and in response, he picked up an axe and delivered a fatal blow, causing the onlookers to quickly turn and flee.
0:12:3|0:12:26|[Chiyou] remained calm and collected, pulling out the long-handled stone axe embedded in a person's body and chasing after the others. Due to unfamiliar terrain, the people of the Shennong tribe ran into a dead end, with [Chiyou] surrounding them from the opposite direction. Suddenly, a tribesman in front lunged towards [Chiyou], who swung his long-handled weapon to break the tribesman's weapon. The broken weapon happened to hit the head of a tribesman behind him. With [Chiyou] closing in step by step, a terrified [Jiang Yan] slowly moved backwards.
0:12:26|0:12:38|He suddenly looked behind [Chiyou] and saw [Jidi] holding a stone hammer, launching a surprise attack on [Chiyou]. [Chiyou] grabbed a stone axe to defend himself, but unexpectedly, a large chunk of the axe was chopped off, and [Jidi]'s weapon was also split in half.
0:12:41|0:12:56|The tribespeople quickly fled, [Chiyou] tried to catch up, but [Jidi] swiftly threw the handle of the hammer at [Chiyou], hitting him on the head. Enraged, he picked up a stone axe and swung it at [Jidi]. She agilely dodged the attack, and as [Chiyou] swung the axe again, she continued to evade. [Chiyou] seemed to be toyed with.
0:12:56|0:13:23|He once again fiercely smashed [Jidi]'s abdomen, this time he was heavily pressed against a tree. [Chiyou] prepared to pursue the victory, but when he swung the stone axe again, [Jidi] perfectly dodged it. Seizing the opportunity while [Chiyou] was distracted, he turned around and punched [Chiyou] in the head. Changing tactics, he pulled out the sword from his waist and stabbed [Chiyou] in the thigh. Enduring the pain, [Chiyou] lifted [Jidi] and threw him to the ground. Seeing him lying on the ground, [Chiyou] picked up the axe and launched another attack. [Jidi] rolled to the side to escape the danger.
0:13:23|0:13:34|The large tree behind them unexpectedly had a deep notch cut out of it, and at the same time, the axe was broken in two. The terrified [Ji Di] slowly stood up, while [Chi You] acted unusually by throwing away the main weapon, and finally gave a sinister smile.
0:13:34|0:13:52|[Jidi] felt a sense of danger, turned around and saw a black bear with its mouth wide open charging towards him. [Jidi] quickly dodged, rolled into the nearby bushes, ignoring his wounds, and quickly got up to face the black bear. The bear, at this moment, stared at [Jidi] with sharp fangs exposed, letting out a terrifying roar as if it was threatening and provoking [Jidi].
0:13:52|0:14:10|[Jidi] was not afraid at all. On the contrary, he raised his hands and bowed to the black bear [Momu]. [Chiyou] smirked at the sight, but the black bear stopped roaring as if understanding something and turned its head. [Chiyou] looked surprised as the black bear then whistled, and the bear, as if receiving a command, snapped back to reality and pounced towards [Jidi].
0:14:10|0:14:19|[Jidi] swiftly turned and ran into the forest, with Heixiong hot on her heels. Unable to shake him off, [Jidi] changed direction, leaped and disappeared into a slope.
0:14:19|0:14:30|The character [Ji Di], hiding in the bushes, immediately opened its mouth and pounced as soon as the bear noticed the human figure and stopped to observe in four directions without moving. [Ji Di] quickly turned and ran in the opposite direction.
0:14:30|0:14:39|The woman with spots all over her face grabbed the vine hanging down from the tree, following closely behind [Jidi], but did not make a move to help. [Jidi] sensed the danger.
0:14:39|0:14:48|He ran while pulling out an arrow from behind and shot her in the back. The enraged woman opened her arms in a cheetah-like posture and pounced towards [Jidi], only to be knocked down by [Jidi] with a stick.
0:14:48|0:15:0|At this moment, the black bear heard the sound and rushed over. It quickly pounced on [Jidi], causing [Jidi] to panic and stumble. In the process, the bow and arrow she carried fell to the ground. Without caring about her shoulder, [Jidi] quickly adjusted her state and stood up to escape.
0:15:0|0:15:8|Suddenly stopped in front of a big tree, looked up at the tree, then turned to look at the bear behind, suddenly had an idea, and took a few steps back to get a running start.
0:15:8|0:15:15|Seeing the black bear about to catch up, [Jidi] took a few quick steps and climbed up the tree. The chasing black bear hit the tree hard, let out a few weakened cries, and then fell silent.
0:15:15|0:15:33|After seeing that there was no danger, [Jidi] jumped down from the tree. At this moment, [Chiyou] and the mysterious woman from earlier arrived. [Jidi] was outnumbered, so he imitated the woman's actions and immediately grabbed a vine to swing a few times before disappearing into the forest.
0:15:46|0:15:50|The escaped high priest [Chiyou] was seriously injured, and the surviving members of the Shen Nong clan gathered around him.
0:16:8|0:16:22|The high priest closed his eyes tightly, without any swallowing movement. By now, he had stopped breathing. Meng, looking at the high priest in shock, his eyes filled with sorrow, then stopped his actions and looked at the tribe members.
0:16:28|0:16:34|The high priest's face was covered in blood, but his expression was peaceful.
0:16:34|0:16:41|Jiang [Yandi] silently lowered his head, his clan members furrowed their brows with tears in their eyes, wailing in sorrow, and then all knelt down.
0:16:41|0:16:49|They knelt with their hands open towards the direction of the high priest, not getting up for a long time. The tribe members could not believe that the respected high priest had left like this.
0:16:49|0:17:1|After a while, Jiang [Emperor Yan] slowly raised his head and looked at the corpse of the High Priest in front of him. His eyes suddenly became determined, and he tremblingly stood up with one hand on the tree trunk.
0:17:9|0:17:29|The morale of the tribe was ignited, they raised their weapons high and shouted loudly. Suddenly, a strange whistle sounded in the distance, and the tribespeople instantly quieted down, carefully discerning the direction of the whistle. They saw a woman standing on a tree, continuously whistling. In an instant, all the wolves and leopards in the forest mobilized and attacked the Shen Nong tribe, causing the tribespeople to gather together in an instant.
0:17:31|0:17:43|The rest of the people quickly formed a human wall facing the fierce wolves and leopards. The ferocious wolves and leopards pounced on them with a leap, opening their bloody mouths to tear and bite at them. The weak tribe members were no match for the vicious beasts.
0:17:43|0:17:46|Afraid that some people would give up resistance, stood still and waited to die.
0:17:46|0:17:57|The tribesman trying to escape was bitten on the leg by the wolves. A leopard attacked from behind, and facing the encirclement, the tribesman, in order to save his life, endured the pain and picked up a weapon to fiercely strike at the evil wolves.
0:17:57|0:18:15|The wolf let out a loud howl, then instantly released its grip. The tribespeople seized the opportunity to stand up, and the wolf whimpered a few times before losing its life. Blood splattered all over the faces of the tribespeople. Feeling unsatisfied, they continued to strike a few more times. The whistle blower's expression turned serious in an instant upon seeing this. He blew the whistle again, and suddenly a group of bandits gathered together to attack the tribespeople. The others picked up their weapons to come to the rescue.
0:18:15|0:18:25|The cheetah collapsed to the ground after being struck by a hammer, the tribe seemed to have found a way to deal with it, their momentum gradually rising. When the tiger attacked, the other companions would come to the rescue, and a blow would kill the tiger.
0:18:25|0:18:48|The herd was gradually losing ground, the whistle blower was getting anxious. He leaped down from the tree, crouched on the ground in a fierce tiger pose, glaring at the [Shennong] tribe. Seeing the number of beasts decreasing, he blew the whistle again. The beasts that heard the whistle no longer attacked the crowd, but ran towards the mountains and forests. The forest after the fight was a mess, the exhausted tribe members lay motionless on the ground, covered in wounds from the bites. The herd ran to the whistle blower's side.
0:18:48|0:19:6|Surrounded by a group of dejected eyes, as if lamenting, the whistle-blower glanced at the injured beloved pet, then turned fiercely towards the direction of the [Shennong] tribe. The shallow water area far from the forest was strangely calm. At that moment, a bird was suddenly hit by a stone and fell into the water. It turned out to be [Jidi]. Without hesitation, he jumped into the water to retrieve the prey. As he walked to the center of the water,
0:19:6|0:19:23|Suddenly losing balance, he started swaying from side to side. Then his body slowly sank. It seemed to be a swamp. He tried hard to walk towards the shore, but his body wouldn't cooperate. In the blink of an eye, the water was already over his neck. He strained every muscle to lift his head as much as possible to breathe normally. He reached out his hand, seeking support.
0:19:23|0:19:33|Suddenly a branch reached out, and he firmly grasped it. It was [Xi Ling Lu Ming] who had extended the branch, along with [Lei]. [Ji Di] slowly revealed his head, and [Lei] turned around to speak to the road behind him.
0:19:34|0:19:44|At the other end of the branch, tied to two deer with a rope, they pulled hard forward. [Lei] followed behind the deer, also pulling the rope. [Ji Di] fell into the swamp, frowning and gritting her teeth, trying to free her body as much as possible.
0:19:44|0:20:6|With the help of [Lei] and two deer, [Jidi] finally managed to slowly reveal his neck and upper body. At this moment, [Jidi] was half-lying in the mud, using his hands to crawl forward bit by bit. Seeing this, [Lei] threw down the rope in her hand to lift him up from the water. After a moment, [Lei] helped him to a safe place. The recovering [Jidi] held a round stone in his left hand, with several straight lines carved on it, and in his right hand, he placed a wooden stick at the center of the lines.
0:20:6|0:20:19|Then [Lei] kept turning the stone, curiously glancing at what [Ji Di] held in her hand.
0:20:19|0:20:33|[Jidi] turned the stick inserted in the Sun Shadow Stone with her hand, [Lei] glanced at the sun, then looked puzzled at the stick.
0:20:41|0:20:43|[Nüwa] looked at Jidi with admiration in her eyes.
0:20:43|0:20:51|He then took the daily food and held it in his hand, carefully touching the carvings on the stone. It was then that he noticed a special symbol.
0:21:0|0:21:8|The two exchanged a smile, [Leizu] glanced down at the sun shadow stone, then looked thoughtfully at Jidi.
0:21:11|0:21:18|[Nuwa] smiled happily, when suddenly the horn sounded again, and a deer flew past followed closely by a fierce leopard.
0:21:20|0:21:42|[Leizu] ran towards the direction where the deer was fleeing, and Jidi quickly followed. While running, he pulled out an arrow from behind and shot it at the cheetah, but the cheetah ran too fast for the arrow to hit. Jidi then quickly took out a second arrow, but due to the weak bowstring, it fell to the ground before reaching the cheetah. In a flash, the cheetah leaped and knocked down the path. Jidi stepped on a piece of wood and jumped onto a tree, taking out a third arrow to shoot at the cheetah, but still missed.
0:21:42|0:22:0|At this moment, the cheetah was feasting on the deer meat. [Leizu] grabbed a long stick and charged forward, thrusting it into the cheetah's abdomen. The cheetah was enraged and lunged towards [Jidi]. Jidi picked up a stick and thrust it into the cheetah's mouth, then forcefully drove the stick through the cheetah's head and into a tree. After struggling for a few moments, the cheetah breathed its last breath.
0:22:0|0:22:9|With a frightened look on her face, [Leizu] gasped for breath heavily. She squatted down and gently touched her pregnant belly. At the same time, [Jidi] hurried forward to check the situation.
0:22:12|0:22:15|Ji Di looked down at the dead deer in front of her, feeling helpless.
0:22:15|0:22:22|He noticed the arrow he shot next to the deer, picked it up and looked at it repeatedly with self-blame.
0:22:33|0:22:40|Ji Di suddenly realized and smiled at [Leizu], saying "Let's do it." [Leizu] tied the leopard tendon to the end of the bow and then slowly pulled the tendon.
0:22:40|0:22:54|Jidi took the leopard tendon from Lv Zhi and quickly tied it to the head of the bow. After wrapping it a few times, he handed the wrapped tendon to [Leizu] while supporting the bow. After wrapping another circle, he left a piece out and tied a knot, then pulled it hard to make it more secure.
0:22:54|0:22:58|Jidi looked at the new bow and arrow, trying to pull the brand new bowstring a few times, which made him extremely excited.
0:23:1|0:23:16|[Leizu] took an arrow from the quiver behind Ji Di and handed it to him. He took it, placed it on the empty bowstring, aimed at a distant big tree, and pulled with force. The arrow firmly stuck into the trunk of the tree. The two of them excitedly ran over, and Ji Di carefully examined the sword stuck in the tree.
0:23:16|0:23:19|At this moment, [Leizu] looked back at the path she had come from, and then said to Jidi,
0:23:30|0:23:43|As the night fell, [Mother Mo] of the Xiong tribe lit a fire and started pounding stones in a house filled with preserved meat. At that moment, Ji Jiu quietly lifted the door curtain and entered. He deliberately coughed, startling [Mother Mo], who then cautiously stood up. Ji Jiu took a deep breath.
0:23:46|0:23:58|Ji Jiu pushed her onto the stone couch behind her, then fiercely kissed her like a wolf, [Mother Mo] was unable to escape. At this moment, she lifted the stone in her hand and smashed it towards Ji Jiu's head, causing him to faint from the heavy blow.
0:23:58|0:24:15|[Mo Mu] pushed him aside, panting heavily. As the sky darkened, [Mo Mu] tied Ji Jiu's hands behind his back, hoisted him onto her shoulders, and carried him in front of the leader of the clan. She then threw him to the ground, and the clan leader looked at [Mo Mu] in confusion.
0:24:23|0:24:28|She kicked [Ji Jiu]'s butt and then walked away, while the tribe members looked at [Ji Jiu]'s miserable state and started mocking him.
0:24:28|0:24:48|Night falls, and the forest is occasionally filled with the sounds of animals. The centuries-old giant trees appear particularly quiet, their smooth trunks marked with scars carved by the passage of time. The large trunks have grown numerous branches, unevenly distributed, having endured generations of storms and witnessed the conflicts between tribes. Yet they remain so lush and upright, full of vitality.
0:24:48|0:24:57|A lush and majestic ancient tree with branches and leaves, standing tall and proud in the sky, adding a layer of mysterious and deep charm to the entire mountain forest, with dreamlike colors.
0:24:57|0:25:14|Jidi and [Queen Mother of the West] sat leisurely back to back on one of the branches, with [Queen Mother of the West] resting her head on Jidi's shoulder, looking happy, while Jidi looked into the distance with a heavy heart, letting out a long sigh.
0:25:16|0:25:32|[Leizu] stopped smiling and no longer leaned on Jidi's shoulder. Jidi, who didn't get a response, turned to look at her. Leizu, like a young girl, shyly lowered her head to think for a moment, then turned to look into Jidi's eyes.
0:25:33|0:25:50|She gazed affectionately at Ji Di, then took the initiative to kiss him. The sudden kiss caught Ji Di off guard like a storm, and he closed his eyes obediently, instinctively reaching out his hands and tightly embracing [Leizu]. [Leizu] reached out her hand, slowly stroked Ji Di's arm and placed it on his shoulder. The two embraced and kissed on the big tree, enjoying the sweetness of the moment.
0:25:50|0:25:57|At this moment, an unusual sound came from behind [Leizu], and Ji Di alertly opened his eyes to see a hundred-meter-long python behind him.
0:25:57|0:26:2|Staring at them intently, [Ji Di] lost interest in continuing to kiss, his expression gradually becoming tense.
0:26:5|0:26:12|The flower-patterned python slowly approached, sticking out its tongue and wriggling its body. Ji Di slowly stood up and slowly pulled out the flat weapon tied around her waist.
0:26:12|0:26:23|Due to fear, [Leizu] stood still, sweating profusely and swallowing saliva constantly. To make matters worse, at that moment, a leopard leaped from the tree behind Ji Di and slowly approached him.
0:26:23|0:26:44|[Leizu] looked at the fierce leopard with widened eyes. Ji Di cautiously turned his head with a weapon in hand, only to see the leopard baring its fangs and glaring at him menacingly. With a python in front and a leopard behind, Ji Di remained calm. He looked up at the tree branch nearby and suddenly had an idea.
0:26:45|0:27:8|Ji Di reached out and embraced [Leizu]'s waist. The two slowly stood up from the tree. Just as the python let out a hiss, the cheetah attacked first. Hearing the sound, the cheetah opened its mouth and pounced towards the two. Ji Di and [Leizu] exchanged a glance, then simultaneously jumped and successfully landed on another branch. Without warning, the cheetah and python collided instantly. The python swiftly moved its body and opened its mouth to feast, but lost balance and fell from the tree along with the cheetah to their deaths.
0:27:8|0:27:14|Ji Di, who narrowly escaped death, continued on to the You Xiong family with [Leizu], only to suddenly see a stick stuck in a small tree ahead.
0:27:38|0:27:56|After a brief commotion, the two arrived at the riverbank. [Ji Di] took out a rope and tied it around [Leizu]'s waist, with the excess part tied around his own waist. He attempted to pull [Leizu] across the river. After preparing their gear, [Huangdi] looked up and smiled at [Leizu]. He then picked up two inflatable skins from the ground and handed them to [Leizu]. Despite the turbulent river filled with filthy mud and sand, the two showed no fear.
0:27:56|0:28:13|Soon after, the two of them jumped into the river one after the other, swimming towards the opposite side where the Youxiong tribe was. The lush forest was shrouded in thick fog, resembling a fairyland. On the other side of the river, just a river away from the Youxiong tribe, [Shennong] and the fleeing tribe members walked barefoot with their heads down in despair, having lost their strength after a long journey.
0:28:13|0:28:21|[Jiang Yan] looked up and saw the people on the other side of the river, as if seeing hope, and walked towards the other side. At this time, You Xiongshi, who was washing jars by the river, looked up and saw them.
0:28:21|0:28:28|Due to the different appearance of [Shennong] from Yuxiong, Yuxiong cautiously reported to his companions.
0:28:29|0:28:51|The Xiong clan people all put down their work and watched vigilantly as the people on the other side of the river stood up. The leader of the Da clan led his people carefully to the river bank in order to dispel the Xiong clan's concerns. [Jiang Yan] led the Shen Nong clan people to take a few steps forward.
0:29:25|0:29:31|[Shennong] placed his hands on his chest and bowed to You Xiong. The next day, [Jidi] and the other two also arrived at You Xiong's place.
0:29:32|0:29:40|They walked hand in hand into the Bear Clan, [Jidi] led him to her home, [Leizu] looked around curiously, when suddenly a scent of food, meaty and fragrant, wafted out from the house.
0:29:40|0:29:47|Long absent [Jidi] was puzzled, [Momu] heard the voice and ran out of the room.
0:29:50|0:29:57|[Jidi] looked at [Leizu] and laughed, and only then did [Momo] notice the woman next to [Jidi].
0:30:1|0:30:7|[Ji Di] turned to look at [Leizu], their hands intertwined, while [Momu] showed a fierce expression.
0:30:33|0:30:47|Mo looked into Ji's eyes, filled with disappointment. She couldn't believe that Ji, who had grown up with her, would treat her like this. Tears kept rolling in her eyes as she turned and ran away. Leizu panicked, looking anxiously at Ji. Leizu took a few steps forward.
0:30:54|0:31:18|[Leizu] was stunned for a second, and Ji Di sensed her concern, smiling at her. The tense expression on [Leizu]'s face finally broke into a smile. At this moment, the heartbroken Mo ran crying to a deserted big tree, thinking of Ji Di's heartlessness earlier. Angered, she turned around, tears streaming down her face. Suddenly, Ji Jiu sneaked up behind Mo with a net, catching her off guard and trapping her. He carried Mo deep into the forest.
0:31:18|0:31:38|The dense fog enveloped the entire forest. Apart from the weak cries of [Mo] and the sound of [Ji Jiu] walking, it was silent. [Ji Jiu] brought [Mo] to a clearing, threw him to the ground, then tossed his axe aside and crouched down to remove the net from [Mo]'s body. The hungry [Ji Jiu] passionately kissed [Mo]'s neck, but [Mo] angrily kicked him with all his strength.
0:31:38|0:31:49|Ji Jiu lost her balance and fell heavily to the ground. Mo quickly stood up and grabbed the small tree next to her. As the tree trunk was too thin, the small tree shook violently, causing the snake on the tree to fall down and bite Ji Jiu's arm.
0:31:49|0:32:9|Ji Jiu looked at the bite wound on his right arm, screamed in fear, and Mo tied his left hand to a tree with a rope. Ji Jiu, lying on the ground, looked at him blankly, only to see him stepping on Ji Jiu's injured arm, staring fixedly at the snake tattoo. Finally, he bent down to pick up the stone axe on the ground. Ji Jiu seemed to understand something as he tightly closed his eyes.
0:32:9|0:32:26|Turning his head to the side, [Mo] began to tremble with fear as he slowly raised the stone axe. Taking aim at the bite mark on [Ji Jiu]'s arm, he viciously chopped it off. [Ji Jiu] clenched his teeth tightly, trying not to let out a loud scream, as the gushing blood instantly splattered half of his face.
0:32:26|0:32:32|In the end, Mo left Ji Jiu alone and ran out of the woods. Still in shock, she quickly arrived at Ji Di's house, panting heavily.
0:32:41|0:32:55|Jidi turned and walked to the pigsty. Mo, unwilling to give up, ran to Jidi's side. Jidi, who was indifferent, paid no attention to her. She suddenly knelt down on both knees, and when Jidi heard the sound, she turned to look at her.
0:32:56|0:33:21|Mo's expression was so determined, but Ji didn't take it seriously. He turned his head away from Mo, holding a clay pot to continue feeding the piglet. Mo stared with wide eyes, tears swirling in his eyes, unable to believe Ji could be so indifferent. He seemed to have made up his mind, tightly pursing his lips as he slowly stood up, looking at the unmoved Ji. He clenched his fists and ran away. Ji watched Mo run off, worried that he might do something foolish, hastily dropping the clay pot and chasing after him.
0:33:21|0:33:43|Mo ran into the woods in a flash, swiftly weaving through the intricate forest. In the quiet woods, the sound of Mo's crying echoed, while Ji Di chased after her relentlessly. Running too fast, Mo quickly ran out of energy and her steps slowed down. Seizing the opportunity, Ji Di swiftly caught Mo in his arms as they both fell to the ground. Mo struggled to break free from Ji Di's grasp, trying to stand up as Ji Di grabbed his shoulders.
0:33:43|0:33:50|Turning around and pinning him down, he gasped heavily, looking at the stubborn [Mo] beneath him, as if he had made up his mind.
0:33:51|0:34:1|[Mo] looked at it in disbelief, his eyes wide open. A smile finally appeared on [Mo]'s face, and tears of joy filled his eyes, feeling completely satisfied.
0:34:1|0:34:5|Jidi La stood up and hoisted him onto her shoulder, walking towards the tribe.
0:34:5|0:34:16|[Mo] bit Ji Di's arm hard to confirm that this was not a dream. Xiong Shi and Shen Nong Shi were farming, each with their own responsibilities, and the land was full of vibrant crops.
0:34:16|0:34:24|The leader of the Bear Clan, satisfied, looks at [Jiang Yan] beside him.
0:34:39|0:34:45|Inside were various ceramic jars, the cave uneven [Ma] carefully walked to the jars.
0:34:45|0:35:5|At this moment, a drop of water dripped from the top of the cave and landed right on [Mo]'s head. She covered her head and looked up, only to find the place extremely damp. She quickly removed the stone pressing on top of the ceramic jar, revealing a murky liquid inside. Sitting next to the jar, she leaned over to smell a unique fragrance emanating from it. Getting closer to the jar's opening, she sniffed carefully and found the scent even more intense, a smell she had never encountered before.
0:35:5|0:35:14|Afterwards, [Ma Dongmei] carefully inserted a finger into it, dipped it in water, confirmed its edibility, and then put it in her mouth to taste the brand new flavor, making her feel fresh and satisfied.
0:35:14|0:35:22|She carefully savored the taste, then smiled with satisfaction. She looked around and finally picked up a bowl-shaped object from the left hand side.
0:35:22|0:35:41|Scooping up a bowl of water from the ceramic jar, she looked at the water in the bowl, leaned in to smell the refreshing fragrance, and forgot everything. She couldn't wait to lift the bowl and drink it all in one go. Due to drinking too quickly, half of the water spilled, but she didn't care at all about the sweet water she made. This made her unable to help but laugh happily, watching the water made in the ceramic jar turn out so successful.
0:35:41|0:35:47|She suddenly reached in and grabbed a handful of sticky rice, put it in her mouth, and then started gobbling it up voraciously.
0:35:47|0:36:8|He was eating the glutinous rice and drinking the rice wine that she brewed herself, feeling satisfied. Looking at his achievement, he felt extremely proud. He couldn't wait to take it to let his people taste it. Later, he filled a small ceramic jar with the rice wine and brought it home. He poured a bowl for [Jidi] and [Leizu]. The two of them looked at the bowl and [Leizu] didn't know what kind of water it was, feeling a bit hesitant.
0:36:8|0:36:15|He saw [Jidi] taking big sips and followed suit with a sip of [Momu], looking expectantly at [Jidi], hoping for praise.
0:36:15|0:36:24|[Jidi] had a completely different expression after drinking the water. It was such a special water, and he had never tasted it before. He savored it carefully, then a smile slowly appeared on his face.
0:36:27|0:36:42|With a flushed face, [Mother Mo] looked at [Ji Di] and smiled contentedly. After drinking too much alcohol, she stood up unsteadily, burped, and took out a piece of earth wrapped in coarse linen, leaving [Leizu] puzzled.
0:36:44|0:36:55|[Mo Mu] knocked on the stone a few times, and after the soil fell off, he picked up two sharp animal bones and pried them open from the middle outwards. When he cleaned off the soil, a whole piece of smoking fat meat was revealed, and the aroma instantly spread out.
0:36:55|0:37:3|Everyone looked at the fragrant and juicy meat in front of them, unconsciously smiling at the corners of their mouths, crazily swallowing saliva. [Mother Mo] sat down slowly and pointed at the meat.
0:37:6|0:37:13|[Jidi] closed his eyes and savored the aroma of the fatty meat, while [Momu] looked at him and burst into laughter joyfully.
0:37:15|0:37:23|The strong liquor gradually went to [Mother Mo]'s head, her face flushed, her eyes unfocused, and suddenly she fell headfirst onto the table, leaving [Leizu] looking bewildered.
0:37:23|0:37:31|Jidi, full from a meal and drink, came to the riverside and began to draw on a large rock with a small stone. Leizu sat beside the rock, watching the marks he made.
0:37:58|0:38:6|Jidi looked at the innocent [Leizu] and smiled, then nodded. The scene shifted to the mountains and forests, with Jidi using her left hand to support a half-chopped dead tree on the ground.
0:38:6|0:38:34|With a sharp stone in his right hand, he chisels the dry wood piece by piece. A hole is carved out of one piece of dry wood. He quickly arranges the dry leaves next to it in two rows, then takes out a sharp wooden stick and inserts it into the hole. With both hands supporting it, he starts spinning it rapidly, allowing the stick to rub against the wood thoroughly. Soon, smoke starts to emerge from the rubbing spot. It turns out he is trying to start a fire by drilling wood. To make the fire burn brighter, he blows on it and then surrounds the hole with the dry leaves. He spins the wooden stick quickly a few more times, and the smoke grows thicker.
0:38:34|0:38:40|He put down the wooden stick, used his hands to protect the dry leaves, and blew gently a few times, and the fire instantly emerged through the leaves.
0:38:40|0:39:0|Jidi took a deep breath, then picked up two branches and placed them on the fire. In no time, the branches turned into two torches. He handed one to the young boy next to him. The boy walked slowly to the pile of trees and threw the torch in. Instantly, a large cloud of smoke rose from the forest, breaking through the trees and reaching towards the sky.
0:39:6|0:39:13|The Xiong family saw the smoke and mistakenly thought it was the enemy deliberately setting fire. The whole family picked up weapons and ran towards the direction of the smoke. To boost morale, they shouted as they ran to see everyone coming.
0:39:13|0:39:25|Ji Didi looked at the big fire pretending to be mysterious.
0:39:26|0:39:43|The roaring fire burned fiercely as the tribe members stood quietly on the side, waiting for the surprise after the fire. As time passed, things hidden in the fire gradually revealed their true forms. In the middle of a tall and large solid object of earthy yellow color, there stood a dry tree branch firmly on the ground, now blackened by the fire.
0:39:54|0:40:6|Ji Di picked up a long branch from the ground and leaned it against the wall. The tribe members followed suit, picking up long branches and intertwining them on top. In no time, a simple roof took shape. Looking at the completed roof, Ji walked in front of the tribe members and made a formal introduction.
0:40:10|0:40:24|A burly tribesman handed his weapon to the person next to him, then walked to the wall and kicked it hard with his foot. However, the wall didn't budge at all. The tribesman stumbled back a few meters and fell to the ground, as the crowd roared. The tribal leader, however, seemed lost in thought.
0:40:36|0:40:45|The tribe members all looked at Ji Di, who nodded firmly at the wall.
0:40:47|0:40:56|Time flies, [Emperor Yan], the tribe has been surrounded by walls, and the people live a brief and peaceful life.
0:41:4|0:41:9|[Leizu] smiled and lifted the grass on her shoulder, [Momu] looked at her and laughed, then the two of them walked into the house.
0:41:9|0:41:25|In the mouth of [Leizu], the millet and the Job's tears are the food source of [Yandi]. The vast millet fields stretch as far as the eye can see, each grain full of food. [Yandi] gathers around, and one person uses a sickle to cut down a bunch, rubs it in his hands to reveal edible millet, picks up one and puts it in his mouth to taste.
0:41:31|0:41:51|While everyone was celebrating, eerie laughter rang out again. The fierce tiger and pixiu all sprang into action. [Emperor Yan] suddenly panicked, shouting and running quickly towards the tribe where bears, tigers, jackals, and wolves with bared fangs were prowling, emitting terrifying roars as they relentlessly pursued. The whistle blower stood on top of a tree, continuously blowing the whistle, summoning more ferocious beasts to attack [Emperor Yan].
0:41:53|0:42:15|[Yandi] tribesmen helped each other and finally ran into the tribe before the beasts caught up. They closed the big gate made of rough wood, and several people took out idle wood to insert horizontally on the gate. The tiger wanted to attack the tribesmen, but a fierce pounce failed to cross the gate. All the beasts were blocked outside the gate, stretching their claws through the crack in the door. [Yandi] exerted force against the door, holding a stone axe to resist. At this time, the alarm sounded again, and all the beasts retreated. The unwilling tiger suddenly stopped and turned back.
0:42:15|0:42:37|Head looked at the sound of retreat, which made it have to leave. Without the attack of wild beasts, [Yandi] still had fear on his face. It turned out that [Chiyou] walked over carrying a stone axe. [Yandi] observed his every move through the crack of the door. [Chiyou] sensed something was wrong. He looked around and saw that both sides of the wooden door were surrounded by walls made of yellow mud, with tree trunks connecting the walls, making it easy for people to enter. He observed all of this with fresh eyes.
0:42:37|0:42:57|The people inside the gate were unaware of his intentions, hiding behind the gate in fear and watching. They saw him carrying a long-handled weapon slowly walking towards the left wall. The wood exposed above the wall seemed to be shouting. [Chi You] took a few steps towards the mud wall, then stopped. He looked at the wall with a sneer, held the long-handled weapon in his hand, and his face suddenly became fierce. With a roar, he swung the weapon fiercely towards the wall.
0:42:57|0:43:1|The stone axe unexpectedly broke, with only a slight dent in one place, the rest of it was intact.
0:43:3|0:43:23|He threw away the broken weapon in his hand, and with both hands he lifted a stone weighing tens of kilograms. He exerted all his strength to slowly raise the stone above his head, and then smashed it towards the wooden door. Although the support of the people behind the door was not a big obstacle, they were frightened and took a few steps back. Then, [Chiyou] picked up another huge stone and smashed it towards the wooden door again.
0:43:23|0:43:31|The wooden door couldn't withstand the force and was smashed open, looking at the damaged door, [Emperor Yan], who was blocking the door, could no longer hold back and retreated back to the tribe.
0:43:32|0:43:48|[Chiyou] pursued the enemy and picked up a huge rock to smash the wooden gate. The gate couldn't withstand the blow and collapsed instantly, but the tunnel wall remained intact. [Chiyou] looked at the wall in surprise, curious about who had built it. Stepping on the broken gate, he strode into the Youxiong tribe.
0:43:48|0:44:13|The Jiuli tribe people also rushed over, watching the aggressive foreign tribes. Hiding behind the altar in fear, [Chiyou] walked to the front of the altar. He looked up at the animal skin hanging above and then forcefully tore it down. The astonished Aoxiong stared wide-eyed as [Chiyou] hung the animal skin around his neck. After tidying up, he noticed the cow head specimen hanging in the center of the door and reached out to touch it a few times, letting out a cold laugh.
0:44:13|0:44:20|The leader of the Bear Clan looked serious and silently turned his head to one side, [Chi You] glanced at the leader, then turned and pointed at the wall.
0:44:21|0:44:26|The leader of the Bear Clan looked up at the incredibly sturdy wall, despite the cracks.
0:44:27|0:44:34|Upon hearing the chief's response, [Chi You] squatted down contentedly and continued to question the chief.
0:44:52|0:45:0|[Chi You] lowered his head in thought for a moment, then slowly stood up and looked around at the oppressed members of the Youxiong clan. He then spoke to the clan leader.
0:45:43|0:45:50|He walked away with a smile, while the clan leader looked thoughtfully at who built this wall, [Chi You].
0:45:56|0:46:19|[Jidi] was hunting in the mountains at this time, and saw a deer leaping quickly in the forest. [Jidi] chased after it from behind, holding a bow and arrow ready to shoot at any time. When the deer ran onto a flat ground, [Jidi] saw the opportunity and immediately raised the bow, pulled the string, aimed at the deer, and shot. The improved arrow had great power, and the deer fell to the ground immediately when hit. Just as [Jidi] was happy, suddenly a sound of an eagle came from behind.
0:46:19|0:46:44|He flapped his huge wings and swooped down towards [Jidi]. Just in time, [Jidi] picked up a stone and threw it at the eagle. Unexpectedly, the eagle caught the stone with its claws and threw it to the ground. In front of the massive eagle, the strong [Jidi] appeared particularly petite. Startled, he sat down on the ground. Seizing the opportunity, the eagle grabbed a deer from the ground and flew into the air. [Jidi] suddenly stood up, grabbed his bow and arrow, and ran a few steps after the eagle. After aiming at the target, he used all his strength to shoot.
0:46:44|0:47:6|The wounded eagle dropped the deer with an arrow and fled in panic, while the pregnant [Mother Mo] gave birth in a cave. The women of the Xiong clan held a special ceremony outside the cave, forming three neat rows, all squatting on the ground with arms stretched out, palms touching those of the person in front and behind. They then bowed down in a kneeling position, before straightening up and looking up at the sky.
0:47:6|0:47:27|Repeatedly taking the lead, [Leizu] clearly showed signs of physical exhaustion. With a furrowed brow and pale lips, she began to see double as the sky suddenly started to rain. Despite the pain, she gritted her teeth and persevered for [Momu], who was kneeling on a stack of grass, clutching the wall tightly and crying out in agony. Just as the ceremony was about to end, a cry rang out and the child was finally born.
0:47:27|0:47:53|Exhausted [Mother Mo] almost fainted, but when she saw the child, she smiled from the heart. She noticed the child enduring the pain of the umbilical cord, so she picked it up and used all her strength to bite it off with her teeth. At this moment, there was also a joyous occasion in the mountains. The men collectively ran into the forest, and [Chief Di] walked up to the prey and let out a roar, informing his companions of his successful hunt.
0:47:53|0:48:15|The tribespeople shouted [Jidi]'s name repeatedly, [Jidi] lifted the fat roadkill high above his head. This successful hunt once again boosted his prestige. The weak [Momu] lay in a cave filled with dry grass, covered in animal skins. [Leizhu] slowly picked up the baby and looked at the tiny life in amazement and joy. Then he lifted the baby above his head with both hands, allowing him to be baptized by the rain.
0:48:15|0:48:24|[Mother Mo] struggled to prop up her body, reaching out her hand to see her child's face with her own eyes.
0:48:25|0:48:36|[Nüwa] nodded, [Mòmu]’s pale face instantly lit up with a sweet smile, and [Jidi], who had just successfully hunted, was in a great mood. He squatted in front of a wild flower, couldn't help but pick one and smell the fragrance, which was refreshing and delightful.
0:48:36|0:48:58|The tribespeople next to them are processing deer meat. They have clear division of labor. One person is using a sharp stone to separate the skin and meat, handing the peeled meat to a companion who is starting a fire. The companion takes the meat and hangs it on a rack above the fire to roast. Another person is responsible for putting the meat into a pot of prepared sauce for marinating. At this moment, two tribal leaders are being supported by the tribespeople as they walk over. [Ji Di] immediately stands up upon seeing them, and the elder of the Xiong clan, [Elder Ji Shan], lets out a sigh.
0:49:33|0:49:39|[Jidi] looked at the sharp spear without saying a word, at this moment [Elder Jishan] walked up to [Jidi] holding the scepter representing the Jixiong clan.
0:49:48|0:49:56|He handed the scepter to [Jidi], who frowned at the scepter. After a moment of contemplation, he took the scepter. Suddenly, a hurried voice came from not far away.
0:50:6|0:50:25|[Jidi] suddenly frowned nervously, looking serious. Everyone looked surprised as the scene shifted to a simple room made of earth by the Jiuli tribe. A fire was burning low, and pregnant [Leizu] sat on a bed covered with animal skins. She was motionless out of fear. Suddenly, a lecherous laughter came from outside the door. The leader of the Jiuli tribe stood at the entrance, looking at [Leizu] with a malicious smile.
0:50:25|0:50:37|He waved his big hand, and the guards at the door all left the clan leader and walked to the side of [Miao Zu]. He excitedly made a sound and shook his body, throwing down the feather inserted on his head. Startled, [Miao Zu] supported her stomach and stood up difficultly, running in the opposite direction, which
0:50:37|0:50:49|The clan leader became even more excited. He jumped up to the window and caught up with [Leizu] in an instant. He embraced [Leizu] from behind and threw him onto the bed. The clan leader laughed even more recklessly, grabbing [Leizu]'s legs with both hands, trying to pry them apart. At this moment, the clan leader noticed his protruding abdomen.
0:50:49|0:51:5|He reached out and touched, then he opened the legs of [Leizu]. [Leizu] tried hard to pull out one hand and gave him a slap, then kicked him. The unprepared tribal leader immediately fell to the ground. Seeing this, [Leizu] tried to crawl away, but the tribal leader grabbed her. As he picked up a stone to hit her, a hand suddenly appeared and grabbed him.
0:51:11|0:51:27|[Chiyou] snatched the stone from the tribal leader's hand, his angry face trembling slightly. The frightened [Leizu] supported her pregnant belly and stood up, staggering towards the door. The tribal leader wanted to chase after him, but his hand was firmly held by [Chiyou], who smirked disdainfully.
0:51:31|0:51:50|The scene shifts to outdoors, where the Jiuli tribe is holding a special ceremony. From a distance, Ji Di aims and shoots an arrow, hitting a person dancing on the platform. The Jiuli tribe is startled and immediately turns to look in the direction of the shooter. Ji Di, standing on the roof, shoots a second arrow, which firmly lands on the sacrificial platform behind the tribe. Ji Di then jumps down from the roof and stands opposite [Chi You].
0:51:50|0:52:17|[Chi You] took a glance, then turned around to pull out the sword deeply inserted in the head of the deceased tribesman. His hand involuntarily trembled as he examined the sword carefully. Seeing Ji Di's superb swordsmanship, [Chi You] had no choice but to release the wild beasts. Instantly, a noisy and chaotic clamor erupted as fierce tigers and black leopards all emerged, baring their fangs and raising their tails, their fierce gazes fixed on Ji Di as they pounced. Ji Di ran forward with all his might, occasionally looking back at the wild beasts. Despite their ferocity, Ji Di showed no fear.
0:52:17|0:52:36|With a kick, [Ji Di] hooked the thick vine hanging nearby and threw it into the air as the wild beasts closed in. Suddenly, he jumped up, grabbed the vine and spun in the air. Due to their high speed, the fierce beasts all rushed off the cliff, letting out a series of pitiful roars. After spinning around once while holding onto the vine, [Ji Di] swung the vine, planted his right foot on the edge of the cliff, and then pressed against the cliff wall to hide.
0:52:36|0:53:0|Before long, the ferocious beasts all fell off the cliff, the plan succeeded. Ji Di looked down at the bottom of the cliff with a smile. As night fell, the gentle breeze rustled the tall grass, making a rustling sound. [Leizu] stood in the middle of the grass, looking around. At this moment, Ji Di ran over from a distance. [Leizu] quickly turned around to see his beloved running towards him, feeling a sudden sense of security. Ji Di ran up to [Leizu] and stopped in front of him, his eyes full of tenderness.
0:53:0|0:53:21|He held [Leizu] in his arms, and the seemingly strong [Leizu] couldn't hold back anymore, tears filled her eyes in an instant. After the excitement, Jidi gradually calmed down, frowning in confusion as to why [Chiyou] spared him. He looked at [Leizu] as if searching for an answer, and [Leizu] understood his meaning in an instant.
0:53:21|0:53:34|Jidi turned his head and sighed softly. The words "surrender" would never be realized by him. He took a few steps towards the direction where [Chiyou] was, his eyes filled with determination. Then he decisively said,
0:53:36|0:53:55|As the day breaks, the imminent battle between the Xiong clan and the Jiuli tribe is about to begin. The two tribes stand on opposite sides, with Ji Di and [Chi You] at the forefront. The Jiuli tribe members are dressed in animal skins, wearing animal bones on their heads, and holding sharp weapons as they march menacingly forward. Before the battle begins, both sides start performing war dances. The Xiong clan members raise their weapons above their heads,
0:53:55|0:54:16|With firm and rhythmic steps, [Ma Dongmei] swings the sharp weapon in both hands, sometimes swaying back and forth, sometimes crossing and rotating, as if facing an invisible enemy. Each movement seems to strike at the enemy's vital points. The weapons make a rustling sound as they move, as if taunting the enemy. The Jiuli tribe on the opposite side shows no weakness, their unique style of warfare exuding dominance.
0:54:16|0:54:36|It's as if they are engaged in a special competition with the Yous, with their weapons becoming the highlight. They swing from side to side, making stabbing gestures, and at times attack from the front and back, extending their weapons. The invisible beast bones on their faces add a sense of fear. Although we can't see the faces of the tribespeople, their aggressive strikes and firm steps indicate a significant increase in their momentum.
0:54:36|0:54:41|At this moment, [Chi You] raised the weapon in his hand and let out a powerful roar, the echo reverberating.
0:54:43|0:54:48|They are not only showcasing the most magnificent and graceful dance skills, but also the most powerful dance moves.
0:54:48|0:55:13|The war dance has aroused the desire for battle between the two tribes. Everyone's eyes are so determined. [Leizu] is holding a weapon, breathing heavily, with a fierce look in her eyes. At this moment, a tribesman behind her takes away the long spear she used for the dance, while another tribesman quickly brings two short-handled stone drums to [Leizu]. She looks at the fierce [Chiyou] slowly reaching out to take the stone axe and raises it in front of her, ready to compete with [Chiyou].
0:55:13|0:55:28|[Chiyou] also showed no weakness. He raised high the long-handled stone axe in his hand and let out a roar. The tribesmen behind him also raised their weapons. [Leizu] walked towards [Chiyou] with a determined look in her eyes, while the accompanying tribesmen placed their weapons in front of their chests, ready for battle at any moment.
0:55:28|0:55:35|At this moment, the Jiuli tribe also quickly adjusted their posture, gripping their weapons, and followed [Chi You] behind in a calm and prepared manner for battle.
0:55:35|0:55:42|At this moment, the two tribes suddenly started running, shouting and raising their weapons, on the brink of a fierce battle.
0:55:43|0:55:55|The Jiuli tribe launched the first attack, running while taking out round stones from their waists to throw at the Youxiong clan. Caught off guard, they were at a loss for a moment and could only dodge flexibly like ants on a hot pan.
0:55:55|0:56:16|The power of the original stone is immense. The tribe members who were hit fell to the ground instantly. The Jiuli tribe became even more audacious in throwing the original stones. Some fell down instantly. Seeing the Jiuli tribe gaining the upper hand, [Leizu] merged the weapons in her hands into one, and with astonishing strength, she threw a sharp beast bone from her waist towards the Jiuli tribe. Before [Chiyou] could react, it hit the horn on his forehead.
0:56:16|0:56:28|The headdress on top of his head instantly fell off, [Chiyou] was completely enraged, he shouted and wielded his weapon towards Jidi, who did not back down, her face filled with anger, and the two tribes instantly engaged in a fierce battle.
0:56:28|0:56:43|The spear of the Jiuli tribe is extremely sharp, causing the enemy to bleed instantly when struck. As the first wave of attack subsides, the Jiuli tribe from behind rushes in like a hurricane. However, the Xiong tribe is equally formidable, their stone axes are powerful enough to kill the enemy on the spot with a single blow.
0:56:43|0:56:56|The tribesmen rushed forward one by one, waving their stone drums and fighting bravely. The two sides were evenly matched, and they did not retreat for the glory of the tribe. The clean lawn was instantly dyed red with blood, and the weaker women became the biggest casualties of the war.
0:56:56|0:57:8|The woman with her ponytail weapon knocked off sat on the ground retreating, while the man in the mask showed no mercy and continued to press on. He suddenly raised the stone axe and shouted as he smashed it towards the woman, who raised her arms in a feeble attempt to defend herself in fear.
0:57:8|0:57:20|Just as the attack was about to hit, Ji Di suddenly appeared, raising the stone axe in his right hand to knock away the masked man's weapon. At the same time, he extended the stone axe in his left hand to stab towards his neck. Ji Di didn't have time to help up the ponytail girl, immediately rushing to assist the nearby tribesmen.
0:57:20|0:57:24|The person from the Jiuli tribe saw the situation and said to the person next to them who blew the whistle,
0:57:26|0:57:43|The whistleblower woman clenched her teeth and let out an animal-like roar, opening her body like a fierce tiger, with all four limbs on the ground, pouncing towards You Xiong, then reaching out her hand to viciously dig into the enemy's neck. Her nails were exceptionally sharp, leaving three marks on the man's neck in an instant, followed by a gush of blood. The elder of the You Xiong clan watched this scene from a distance.
0:57:43|0:58:4|The furrowed brow, the Jiuli tribe's eyes turned red, watching as the Xiong clan was about to be defeated. At this moment, three people from the Xiong clan brought out a heavy weapon - two sharp tusks tied together with a rope. Due to their large size, the enemy was caught off guard and could only wait for death. The Xiong clan aimed at the target, piercing the enemy's chest in one strike, the tusks instantly dyed with the gushing blood.
0:58:26|0:58:30|Jidi's face splattered with blood, his veins bulging, as he cut a path towards [Chiyou].
0:58:30|0:58:38|[Chiyou] raised the stone axe, ready to strike. Suddenly, Jidi took a step and slid down towards [Chiyou]'s back, grabbing the weapon in her hand, aiming at his back.
0:58:38|0:58:59|[Chiyou] quickly came to his senses and dodged the attack aimed at his chest. Ji Di collapsed weakly on the ground. [Chiyou] took advantage of the situation and raised his stone axe to strike at Ji Di. Just in time, Ji Di managed to dodge the attack with a quick turn. As [Chiyou] was about to launch a second attack, Ji Di swiftly picked up a weapon and stood up to confront him. Unable to withstand [Chiyou]'s strength, Ji Di could only dodge the attacks.
0:58:59|0:59:5|Seeing that her strength was almost depleted, [Jidi] picked up a stone axe to fight back, but was instantly knocked down to the ground.
0:59:5|0:59:13|The Jiuli tribe shouted excitedly, [Chiyou] was ready to eradicate the enemy, and an elder of the Xiong clan expressed concern.
0:59:14|0:59:34|Jidi did not fight to the death. Instead, he was seen running towards an open space with a weapon in hand, with [Chiyou] closely chasing from behind. In an instant, the two ran out of the melee area. Some members of the Xiong clan were observing everything from the grass not far away. It turned out that they had already set up a trap. Unaware, [Chiyou] was still chasing at full speed. Jidi easily jumped over the trap and lured [Chiyou] to follow him to the ambush point, where the lying-in-wait people shouted out.
0:59:43|1:0:5|At this moment, Ji Di and another tribe member ran from two directions, each holding a weapon and continuously attacking him. [Chi You] was powerless and could only endure the attacks. Suddenly, a whistle-blower leaped forward like a fierce tiger, using sharp nails to dig into the enemy. Finally, he jumped on [Chi You]'s body, attempting to tear off the ropes on him. Xiong Shi, who was pulling the ropes, picked up a nearby tree branch and smashed it towards the whistle-blower, causing her intense pain and screams.
1:0:5|1:0:17|But she still didn't back down, biting hard at the back of the rope net. After biting it off, she jumped to the front of [Chi You] and continued to bite the rope net. The rope man picked up a large stone and threw it at her repeatedly, seeing that she still didn't stop biting the net.
1:0:17|1:0:43|The rope man dropped the rope in his hand, picked up a weapon and ran over to knock him down. By this time, the rope net had been bitten off and he struggled to break free from the net. He looked at the whistle blower who was seriously injured, suddenly clenched his teeth and grabbed the weapon in the rope man's hand, trying to break it. At this moment, several people from the Xiong clan lifted a thick tree trunk together and rushed towards [Chiyou]. [Chiyou] suddenly broke the weapon in his hand into two pieces with his bare hands, half of it inserted into the abdomen of the rope man, and then raised the half stone axe in his hand to defend.
1:0:43|1:1:5|Facing the overwhelming pressure from both sides, he gritted his teeth and persisted. His veins bulged as he exerted brute force to split apart some tree trunks. Seeing this, the tree hugger immediately advanced, attempting to bring down [Chiyou]. [Chiyou], using all his strength, managed to split all the tree trunks. Ji Di was dumbfounded and issued orders, the brave do not suffer losses. Ji Di quickly led the members of the Bear Clan to escape.
1:1:7|1:1:19|The enraged [Chiyou] would not easily let them go. After confirming the direction in which the Xiong clan fled, he picked up the blood-stained stone axe on the ground and shouted. At this moment, the Jiuli tribe rushed over to engage in a life-and-death battle with the Xiong clan.
1:1:19|1:1:32|Who would have thought they were well prepared, as they ran into the woods and pulled up a large net to form a wall. The Jiuli tribe could not break the highly resilient net, only to watch them escape. [Chi You] picked up a stone axe and swung it at the king in vain.
1:1:32|1:1:41|The escaped tribesmen, in order to avoid being hunted down by the Jiuli tribe, worked together with great efficiency to build a raft to cross the river. Only by crossing the river could they find temporary safety.
1:1:41|1:2:1|Only to see the two of them carrying a frame to transport an inflatable skin bag, while the others were making a raft. [Leizu] stood up the finished raft, then tightly tied the skin bag to the raft. After tying the skin bag securely, in order to make it stronger, he pulled the rope hard. Just as he was about to tie the second skin bag, a tribesman ran anxiously from a distance to say to [Leizu],
1:2:22|1:2:28|[Nüwa] paused for a moment, then immediately turned and ran towards the river, followed closely by her fellow tribespeople.
1:2:37|1:2:51|Not far away in the mountains, the Jiuli tribe quietly chased after them. At this moment, in order not to burden the tribe, the two helped the elderly Jiang Yan walk towards the middle of the river. Many elderly tribe members leaned on crutches and followed Jiang Yan. [Ji Di] ran to the riverbank and watched this scene.
1:2:53|1:3:6|The tribe members who were about to die seemed to ignore the warning and continued walking towards the river. [Ji Di] anxiously jumped into the river and grabbed Jiang Yan.
1:3:9|1:3:17|The arrival of [Chiyou] made the Youshi who were making wooden rafts restless instantly. They picked up the wooden rafts they were making and hurriedly fled. Groups of Jiuli people holding weapons shouted and ran over.
1:3:21|1:3:29|The Jiuli tribe launched an attack, their momentum fierce as they began looting. Those who didn't have time to escape were hacked to death by the enemy. Hidden behind a haystack, [Ji Jiu] took advantage of the enemy's distraction.
1:3:42|1:3:58|All jumped into the river, luckily protected by their skin bags. They quickly headed towards the other side of the river. Sitting on the raft, [Ji Jiu] shouted to speed up the raft. The pursuing Jiuli tribe couldn't enter the river, so they stood in the middle of the river and started throwing weapons. The people who thought they could escape were still hit by the weapons and instantly submerged by the river.
1:3:58|1:4:13|Watching the scattered Xiong clan members in the river, [Chi You] suddenly became interested. He picked up a huge rock from the ground and threw it into the river with all his strength. A wooden raft was hit, revealing a large hole in the middle, causing splashes of water to rise instantly. All the people on the raft fell into the river.
1:4:13|1:4:34|At this moment, the Jiuli tribe people handed another stone to [Chiyou]. He raised it above his head and fiercely threw it out, hitting another wooden raft. Watching the panic-stricken Youxiong clan, the Jiuli tribe let out victorious roars. They stopped attacking, and the surviving tribe members grabbed the inflated animal skins, swiftly swimming towards the other side of the river. Crossing the great river, [Momu] stood on the shore holding a child.
1:4:34|1:4:52|Ji Jiu squatted on the side watching the other side of the river. At this moment, Ji Di and Jiang Yan Di led the rest of the clan towards them. Ji Di walked up to Mother Mo and touched her shoulder, then continued walking towards the shore. The turbulent river gradually calmed down at this moment, and Jiang Yan Di looked at the destroyed homeland on the other side of the river.
1:5:10|1:5:35|Jiang [Yandi] looked at the crying baby in the arms of [Momu], gently stroking his head. Then [Momu] handed the child to [Jidi], who reached out and slowly took the child into his arms. He took a few steps forward with the child in his arms, looking at the destroyed homeland on the other side of the river. His eyes suddenly became determined, then he lifted the child high. The crying baby kept squirming, the sunlight shining on him. All the clan members looked at the baby as if they saw the endless descendants.
1:5:35|1:5:57|He symbolizes the common hope of the Xiongnu and Shennong tribes. As night falls and the turbulent river becomes unusually calm, a wooden raft with an inflatable skin slowly drifts towards the opposite bank. A head peeks out from behind the raft, revealing [Jidi]. He cautiously looks around, making sure there is no danger nearby, before picking up the stone axe on the skin.
1:5:57|1:6:3|Then he pushed the raft ashore and returned to the place where the Xiong family used to live on the other side of the river.
1:6:3|1:6:22|Through the baptism of war, the scene is a mess, with broken houses and wooden sticks and skins scattered everywhere, and bodies covered in blood lying on the ground. It is enough to make one's heart tremble. In their final moments, they still tightly grip their weapons, with scattered skins for crossing the river by their side. The fierce enemies have shattered their last hope of survival.
1:6:22|1:6:50|[Jidi] walked among them, watching as the once valiant tribespeople became helpless, and the altar where sacrifices were made fell into disrepair. [Jidi] stared at the altar, tears welling up in his eyes. Disobeying his own will, he dropped his weapon and knelt before the altar with a thud. Though the altar was no longer intact, his faith remained unwavering. He slowly placed his hands on his chest, then opened them devoutly in a gesture of worship towards the altar. He prayed that his upcoming plan would be a great success.
1:6:50|1:7:8|In the early morning, the vines in the forest intertwined with each other, like layers of overlapping large nets. The cold mountain forest echoed with the calls of birds. [Ji Di] was seen holding a weapon in his left hand, while his right hand was placed near his mouth, simulating bird calls. He walked through the dense jungle and grass, observing his surroundings as he moved forward.
1:7:8|1:7:14|This is the unique recognition code of the Bear Clan. At this moment, behind a tree not far away, the elder of the Bear Clan hears the sound.
1:7:14|1:7:22|Leading a group of tribespeople, [Ma Dongmei] cautiously peeks out and then carefully walks towards the direction of the bird call. The other tribespeople hiding in another location also slowly come out upon hearing the call.
1:7:22|1:7:40|After carefully observing and confirming that they were among their own people, he spoke to the people beside him. At this moment, the Ji Di suddenly leaped down from the collapsed roof while the Ji Li tribe members were still asleep. The tribe leader who was sleeping in front of him instantly woke up, and he grabbed the leader's neck.
1:7:44|1:8:1|The tribal leader was speechless, he shook his head to command the tribe, at this moment a female tribesman picked up a sharp animal bone and stabbed it into [Jidi]'s back. [Jidi] punched the attacker in pain, the tribal leader covered [Jidi]'s head with animal skin. As soon as he uncovered it, a woman rushed over and grabbed his neck, knocking him down on the bed. The rest of the tribesmen came forward to punch and kick him, while the tribal leader cheered on the side.
1:8:1|1:8:19|When the tribesmen were about to attack with weapons, [Jidi] quickly grabbed her hand and threw her one meter away, then freed her hand to pick up a ceramic jar next to her and smashed it at the person choking him. Then she kicked her away, leaving the tribal leader stunned. Seeing no one coming to help, he prepared to escape, but [Jidi] picked up a weapon next to her and threw it at him, and he agilely dodged it.
1:8:19|1:8:38|[Jidi] was about to chase out, when a fat woman suddenly pounced on him. [Jidi] spun around but couldn't shake her off. As the leader of the house ran out, he saw a large group of Youshi clan members approaching with weapons. [Jidi] stood there in confusion, unable to move. At that moment, [Chiyou] arrived and knocked down the beam at the door, hitting the Youshi clan members. Startled by the noise, [Jidi] suddenly threw himself backwards.
1:8:38|1:8:47|The fat woman fell heavily on the bed, ran to the door, saw [Chi You] stunned for a few seconds, with a hint of fear on her face, and the clan leader instantly became arrogant.
1:8:51|1:8:59|The Xiong clan retreated in an instant, [Ji Di] glanced at [Chi You] who then fled as well. The angry tribal leader looked at [Chi You] and took all the tribe members away.
1:9:4|1:9:22|The words were not finished when suddenly a thunder appeared in the sky, followed by a heavy rainstorm with lightning and thunder. The heavy rain washed over every tribe, but the war between the tribes did not stop. The people of the Jiuli tribe were seen struggling to cross the swift stream with their weapons, wrapped in animal skins without any defense, letting the rain beat against their bodies.
1:9:22|1:9:37|Not long after, they arrived at the Youxiong tribe, where the bodies had already been cleaned up. Four Youxiong tribesmen emerged from behind the wall with bows and arrows, lining up at the door and aiming at the invading enemies. [Chiyou] looked at the situation in front of him and couldn't help but take a step back.
1:9:39|1:9:54|[Chi You] did not choose to escape, but picked up his weapon and prepared to fight. [Ji Di] calmly said to the tribe, then turned and disappeared into the wall. The tribe also put away their bows and arrows and ran away. [Chi You] knew he had been tricked but still gave the command.
1:9:56|1:10:17|The Jiuli tribe rushed into the Youxiong tribe with great momentum, but unexpectedly the entrance was covered with a pile of grass that suddenly opened to the sides, turning into a huge trap. [Chiyou] fell into it unprepared. The tribespeople quickly stopped and shouted loudly. Before the tribespeople could act, [Jidi] ran over with her people, pulled out her bow and arrow, and shot at the invading enemies.
1:10:26|1:10:43|[Jidi] slowly put down the bow in his hand and walked towards the trap that had been set up in advance. He saw [Chiyou] with a fierce face, roaring loudly. [Jidi] mercilessly covered it with a wooden lid, and after the storm passed, the Xiong clan returned to calmness.
1:10:43|1:10:58|[Queen Mother] led her people to the trap, with two of them holding weapons on the side. One of them lifted the lid, revealing [Chi You] with dried mud all over his face. He looked up warily as [Queen Mother] slowly lowered the basket tied with a rope.
1:10:58|1:11:12|Inside was a portion of wild fruits and water, [Chi You] was already starving. He checked the items and held the ceramic jar for water in his hand, looking at the things inside. Then he drank the sweet water in big gulps, feeling amazed. He savored it carefully.
1:11:26|1:11:30|[Mo Mu] withdrew her gaze from [Chi You] and looked into the distance.
1:11:35|1:11:43|[Chi You] sneered, it was impossible for him. At this moment, [Ji Di] was squatting quietly next to the valley pile, with a vacant look, and the pregnant [Leizu] noticed that he was preoccupied.
1:11:43|1:11:56|Slowly squatting beside him, [Nuwa] placed her hand on his arm. Hearing the sound, he finally came to his senses, looked up at [Nuwa], then lowered his head and slowly stood up, still staring blankly into the distance.
1:11:57|1:12:15|The unusual bird calls at this moment caught the attention of [Jidi]. He turned to look at the river in the mountains, only to see flocks of birds circling in the air. The waterfowl on the water flapped their wings noisily, and [Jidi] took a few steps forward, finally revealing a smile on his face.
1:12:42|1:13:1|[Leizu] suddenly felt it wasn't him who was about to give birth while clutching his stomach. Seeing this, the clan members quickly supported him. At this moment, the Jiuli tribe also noticed something unusual. They watched as the birds in front of them behaved unusually. The Jiuli tribe instantly panicked. Just as they were about to flee, a flood like wild beasts from the mountains rushed out from behind the mountain. Ji Di held a rope and said to the enemy,
1:13:2|1:13:11|[Mo Mu] threw one end of the rope to [Chi You] who glanced at it indifferently while [Ji Di] followed suit.
1:13:12|1:13:21|[Chi You] weakly closed his eyes as Ji Di shouted again, the raging lake water mixed with broken branches and rocks rushing down from the valley.
1:13:22|1:13:35|He then leaped down into the trap, wrapped the rope around [Chiyou]'s waist in coils, and as the flood rushed into the already turbulent river, Ji Di patted [Chiyou]'s face after securing the rope. He was almost unconscious. Ji Di said to [Momo],
1:13:36|1:13:55|Mo exerted all her strength to pull the rope, while the unconscious [Chiyou] remained motionless. [Jidi] struggled to climb up the edge of the trap, then quickly grabbed the rope. Just then, the roaring flood grew closer and closer. Worriedly, [Jidi] looked up and saw the flood, like a fierce beast, destroying the village not far away. In a critical moment, the two of them exerted all their strength to pull the rope back tightly.
1:13:55|1:14:21|Just as the flood was about to reach the Youxiong tribe, the two finally pulled out [Chiyou], and then they quickly ran towards the tribe while supporting [Chiyou]. The flood behind them was about to catch up, and [Jidi] suddenly mentioned that the flood was roaring towards them. The tremendous force caused the nearby rocks to continuously slide down. [Jidi] pushed away the rolling rocks that were about to hit [Mo] heavily on his arm. The flood, like a giant beast, instantly swallowed the entire team in one fell swoop.
1:14:21|1:14:26|The wooden door with the speculative totem was ruthlessly destroyed, accompanied by a deafening roar echoing through the sky.
1:14:26|1:14:46|Before long, the flood finally receded and the sun came out after the rain. After being baptized by the flood, the old and sturdy big tree still stood tall, with many branches slowly sprouting. [Ji Di] in a coma furrowed his brow, trembling due to the pain in his shoulder. Beside him, [Mo] carefully helped him remove the dried leaves from his hair. [Ji Di] slowly opened his eyes.
1:14:46|1:14:54|[Mo] finally smiled, reaching out to touch [Jidi]'s face. [Jidi] looked down at his injured arm, and at that moment [Mo] gently grabbed his injured arm and said
1:14:59|1:15:15|[Princess Di] who was not fully awake yet, watched [Mo] carefully savoring what she had just said, then finally smiled. [Mo] carefully helped him tidy up his messy hair, which was undoubtedly a great piece of good news for him. Having just narrowly escaped death, he received the offspring of heaven's blessing.
1:15:16|1:15:30|The heartfelt words made [Mo] feel very comforted, while [Jidi] suddenly looked nervous with a smile on his face. It seems like he remembered something?
1:15:32|1:15:54|At this moment, he felt a mixture of emotions in his heart, a kind of indescribable sadness. After a fierce mountain flood, the Xiong tribe's village became dilapidated, with deep cracks appearing on the sturdy walls and traces of flood remaining on the muddy ground. [Jiang Yan] walked over, slowly bent down to pick up the muddy rice grains on the ground, holding them in his hands and looking at them repeatedly with a heart full of pain.
1:15:54|1:16:1|The white-haired [Jiang Yan] spent his whole life and efforts on planting grains, but now he is on the brink of death due to being ravaged by a mountain flood.
1:16:1|1:16:14|All the tribespeople stood in line on both sides, watching as Dao Gu's face was filled with seriousness. He looked up at [Ji Di], then took heavy steps towards him. He tried to control his emotions and then said to him,
1:16:24|1:16:50|The disaster has caused him to lose too much. [Jidi] let out a deep sigh. At this moment, [Chiyou] slowly approached [Jidi] with a weapon in hand and the leader of the Jiuli tribe on his shoulder. The current [Chiyou] no longer sees [Jidi] as an enemy, with no killing intent in his eyes. As he walked up to [Jidi], he threw the leader on the ground, causing the leader to cry out in pain a few times and then look around in fear. Finally, [Chiyou] stepped over the leader and walked up to [Jidi], remaining silent for a while.
1:16:55|1:17:8|[Chi You] is convinced by [Ji Di], he raises his weapon with both hands and presents it to [Ji Di]. The tribe members all look towards [Ji Di] as if waiting for him to make a decision. [Ji Di] looks at the former enemy surrendering and can't help but take a deep breath.
1:17:8|1:17:26|He then took the weapon with both hands, looking uneasily at the clenched fist and excited expression of [Elder Ji Shan], which finally made his eyes firm. The constant sacrifices and persistence of the tribe have finally brought about the current stability and peace. The surrendering [Chi You] decided to leave this place. He believed in [Ji Di], but did not completely submit to him.
1:17:26|1:17:34|On the day of departure, [Jidi] bid farewell to [Chiyou]. They walked side by side along the riverbank, with [Chiyou] carrying nothing but his wife and weapons.
1:17:34|1:18:0|[Jidi] stopped after walking a distance and watched [Chiyou] leave. At this moment, the river was calm like a painting, and the surrounding grass was very quiet, as if bidding farewell to [Chiyou]. [Chiyou] took a few steps, then suddenly stopped and slowly placed the pear that [Jidi] gave him on the ground. He turned around to look at [Jidi], admiring her bravery and intelligence. Such a formidable opponent made him reluctant to leave. [Jidi] looked at the paused [Chiyou], thinking that he had changed his mind.
1:18:20|1:18:38|[Jidi] immediately turned around and saw [Momu] and [Leizu] each carrying their children and holding something running towards them. [Leizu] was holding a piece of cloth in her hand. [Jidi] glanced at it but didn't reach out to take it. Seeing this, [Momu] touched the linen bundle on her shoulder and then walked towards [Chiyou].
1:18:38|1:18:42|He took off the linen bag and handed it to [Chi You].
1:18:45|1:18:53|[Chi You] had a surprised expression on his face as he took the salt water, lean meat, and holy water handed to him and passed them to his wife, who pursed her lips and then carried them behind her.
1:18:53|1:19:13|[Nuwa] watched as he accepted the gift and turned to leave. At this moment, [Leizu] walked towards them holding a piece of cloth in her hand. She glanced at [Chiyou] and his wife, then raised the cloth and handed it to [Chiyou]. On the cloth was a comb made of fish bones. [Chiyou] picked up the comb, took a look, and then inserted it into his own hair. [Leizu] smiled with relief, then turned and walked away.
1:19:13|1:19:23|[Chiyou] slowly unfolds the cloth in his hand, which is a scarf. He hangs it around his neck and finally smiles as he looks at the generous [Jidi], [Momu], and [Leizu] in front of him.
1:19:23|1:19:38|After organizing these items, he picked up the raccoon on the ground, turned around and walked straight ahead. [Leizu] watched his departing figure with worry, wanting to stop him, but knowing that [Chiyou] had bigger goals. He took a step forward and shouted.
1:19:49|1:19:55|After saying that, [Nuwa] and [Leizu] watched proudly as [Jidi] defeated [Chiyou], becoming the tribe's belief.
1:19:55|1:20:17|[Chiyou]'s wife blew the whistle again, and two remaining wild beasts rushed out from the bushes. They glanced back at [Jidi] as if bidding him farewell, then slowly turned around and followed their master. A relieved smile finally appeared on [Jidi]'s tense face as he watched the backs of the two humans and two beasts gradually moving away. [Chiyou] finally let go of his hatred and abandoned his ambition for plunder.
1:20:18|1:20:27|In his joy, he also worries that without any relatives or friends to help, only his wife by his side, can [Chiyou] overcome the challenges ahead.
1:20:27|1:20:35|The outcome is unknown. With the departure of [Chiyou], [Jidi] led the people of the hundred tribes through a peaceful 20 years, during which they farmed, wove linen, and made pottery.
1:20:35|1:20:36|Self-sufficient.
1:20:36|1:21:5|The people of the tribe stood on both sides of the paddy field. [Ji Di] held a shovel and dug the moist soil on the ground. He pushed the soil from the middle to the sides, allowing the water from upstream to flow through the gaps. The gaps became larger and the water flowed faster. Watching the continuous flow of water, [Chi You] excitedly shouted. Some even played in the water like children. The women squatted down with ceramic jars to collect water. Afterwards, everyone used their farming tools to manipulate the water in the direction of the flow. At the end of the water flow was a small pond.
1:21:5|1:21:27|Surrounded by endless fields, a small stream solves the problem of water supply for the fields. Scattered around are the [Chiyou] people, all dancing with excitement. The long-awaited day has finally arrived. At this moment, a tribesman rushes from the riverbank, weaving through the crowd to reach the leader of the tribe.
1:21:30|1:21:54|[Jidi] looked towards the riverbank, where a raft slowly docked. A man with a long fur cap on his head, carrying a bow and arrows, and dressed in animal skins, led a wild ox down the bank. Following him was a woman dressed similarly. The tribe members all approached with farming tools in a defensive stance. The two individuals walked up to [Jidi], knelt down without a word, and [Jidi] hesitated for a moment, not reaching out to help them up.
1:22:2|1:22:8|Bo and Wu stood up and looked at the descendants of [Chi You] who had grown up.
1:22:30|1:22:42|Wu finished speaking, lowered her head, raised the divine crown above her head, bent her legs, and with the utmost respect carefully presented the divine crown to Ji Di [Ji Di], who reached out and took the divine crown, carefully examining the exquisite patterns on it.
1:22:42|1:22:47|This is [Chi You]'s blessing and expectation, he is a bit choked up.
1:22:48|1:22:56|Bo turned his head and tugged at the buffalo behind him.
1:23:8|1:23:25|Bo led the wild ox forward, bent down and raised the rope in his hands to hand it to [Jidi]. [Jidi] handed the divine crown in his hands to the person next to him, freeing his hand to grab the rope. He tightened the rope and took a few steps forward, reaching out to stroke the head of the wild ox. The wild ox remained still, and his heart was filled with respect for [Chiyou].
1:23:25|1:23:46|On the other side, [Mother of the Miao] stood beside a large tree, with an old and sturdy trunk covered with cracks and many scratches. She reached out her hand and kept touching these scratches absentmindedly, lost in thought. Suddenly, a hand reached out in front of her, startling her. It was [Leizu]. She took out a wild fruit and handed it to [Mother of the Miao]. [Mother of the Miao] smiled at [Leizu].
1:23:46|1:23:54|Afterwards, [Ma Dongmei] took the wild fruit and examined it carefully. She put the fruit into her mouth and took a bite, then smiled happily.
1:23:56|1:24:18|Night falls, torches burning in the fire basin made of large stones. On the altar at the center of the torches, a round stone table is placed. [Ji Di] stands in the middle, his left hand supporting a huge stone, his right hand holding a pointed stone drawing a special pattern on the stone. He draws a square, with one person above and two people below. [Ji Di] continues to draw. The two children standing beside him do not understand what their father is trying to express, so one of them speaks up and asks,
1:24:46|1:25:4|The next day at dawn, two tribe members were seen carrying containers filled with water, sprinkling it on the steps leading to the altar as they walked. All the tribe members below gathered here, looking towards the altar. At this moment, one tribe member started to beat the drum.
1:25:37|1:25:54|[Jidi], wearing a crown on his head and holding a ceramic bowl, grabbed a handful of sand from the bowl and scattered it towards the altar. Then he turned around to face the gathered centipede crowd, filled with admiration in his heart. He grabbed another handful of sand and scattered it towards the multitude of people. [Jidi] looked at the gathered crowd and began to speak.
1:26:5|1:26:12|The clansmen looked hopefully at the leader of the clan.
1:26:24|1:26:31|The scene of fighting to the death with other tribes to cross the river for essential supplies is vividly remembered.
1:26:31|1:26:50|Watching the peaceful and happy life now, [Huangdi] felt deeply moved. [Momu] carried two bowls of wine to Huangdi, he picked up one of them and poured it heavily on the ground in front of the clan members. The brave warriors who died in the recent war, fought to the death against the enemy, ensuring that the clan can now live a peaceful life.
1:26:50|1:26:56|He then placed the empty bowl in the plate, picked up another bowl of wine, and drank it all in one gulp.
1:26:56|1:27:11|Tribute to the surviving members of the tribe today, the people of various tribes work together to grow rice, make pottery, weave linen, and taste various herbs for their peaceful life today. Under the altar, the people of the tribe look at the leader of the tribe and can't help but raise their hands and cheer loudly.
