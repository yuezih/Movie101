0:1:58|0:2:3|A Japanese soldier with a helmet on his head is taking a break, facing the cold winter sun as he marches forward.
0:2:4|0:2:15|Long-term walking made him unable to think, he just waited for a command, then he put the backpack behind his head, the long spear in front of his chest, and seized the opportunity to lie down on the ground.
0:2:15|0:2:25|In his sleep, Tang Tianxiang seemed to have dreamt of something, or perhaps it was the hard rocks beneath him that prevented him from sleeping peacefully. Unconsciously, the soldier parted his lips and slowly opened his eyes.
0:2:27|0:2:37|Next, he heard his companion calling out to him, and [Kadokawa Masao] quickly adjusted his gear and moved forward again.
0:2:37|0:2:44|Before long, the whole team arrived at a dusty trench, where soldiers with long rifles were already lined up in the one-meter-high ditch.
0:2:46|0:2:50|[Kadokawa Masao] jumped down low and then bent over to pass through a pillar bridge tunnel.
0:2:50|0:2:53|Suddenly, hearing his companion sighing ahead.
0:2:56|0:3:3|He paid no attention and instead took the water bottle from another soldier's hand, quickly gulping down a few big mouthfuls.
0:3:3|0:3:10|After the banquet, he squinted his eyes and looked ahead.
0:3:10|0:3:14|Half of the earth wall, located a hundred meters away, had already been reduced to ruins under the bombardment of shells.
0:3:16|0:3:22|The raging flames of war burned, with the air filled with remnants of ammunition, all pressing down on the city walls.
0:3:22|0:3:31|Several fighter jets flew dangerously close to the city, as if preparing for another attack.
0:3:31|0:3:39|Outside the city, Tang Tianxiang took the lead in the battle, driving two armored vehicles straight to the city gate. After arriving, several other vehicles surrounding the trenches stopped and began firing.
0:3:41|0:3:47|The old crumbling city wall, under the attack of artillery, quickly scattered like flowing sand.
0:3:47|0:3:53|[Kadokawa Masao] and a group of soldiers were squatting silently in the trenches, holding long spears.
0:3:53|0:3:57|Staring with wide eyes, watching as the city wall gradually collapses.
0:3:57|0:4:7|At this moment, inside Nanjing city, under the Yijiang Gate in the north of the city, soldiers under the command of the 36th Division of the Nationalist Army, led by Song Xilian, were huddling in groups by the city gate.
0:4:7|0:4:9|Suddenly, a group of people rushed towards the soldiers from the city.
0:4:12|0:4:18|At the captain's command, the soldiers standing by the city gate tightened their arms and faced the approaching person inside the city.
0:4:18|0:4:22|The layers of defense inside and outside were so tightly sealed that the city gate was completely blocked.
0:4:23|0:4:30|Seeing the crowd gradually approaching the city gate, a young soldier standing at the front of the line tightly hugged his long spear and stepped forward to meet them.
0:4:30|0:4:38|As the KMT troops approached, [Xiao Bing] began to tremble, his hands gripping the gun barrel, unable to stop shaking up and down.
0:4:38|0:4:44|At this moment, looking back at the crowd, a group of soldiers in military uniforms holding guns and batons approached.
0:5:8|0:5:23|In the crowd, whether by accident or design, a shot was fired, igniting the already restless crowd. Upon hearing the gunshot, emotions flared instantly. Escapees held their guns and sticks horizontally across their chests, running fiercely from the sea, knocking down the [Private] who was guarding them.
0:5:28|0:5:35|The team underestimated the determination of the deserters. The human wall they formed with their arms was quickly broken through in just a few moments.
0:5:35|0:5:42|In the human wall, the officer [Lu Jianxiong] and the fat soldier [Shun Zi] were pushed to the outermost edge of the crowd.
0:5:42|0:5:51|As Tang Tianxiang picked up the long spear and stood up, turning around, the fleeing soldiers had already rushed towards the city gate like madmen.
0:5:51|0:5:56|The city gate in front of them was tightly closed, and the offensive built with layers of sacks was also blocking the way for everyone.
0:5:58|0:6:5|The deserter lying in front was pushed and fell to the ground, unable to dodge, and was then stepped on by the person behind him.
0:6:5|0:6:16|Before long, they unexpectedly built a human ladder, and the deserters at this moment, regardless of the lives beneath their feet, used both hands and feet to crazily smash the sacks blocking the gate tunnel behind them.
0:6:16|0:6:23|Before the sack was cleaned up, the deserter found a gap and struggled to get in, falling down the palace and then fleeing straight out the door.
0:6:25|0:6:35|On the other side, after using cannons to demolish the city walls, Japanese soldiers leaned against the ruins with their arms raised high holding long spears, waving flags in celebration.
0:6:35|0:6:44|And within a household, upon hearing that the army had also fled, the common people hurriedly followed with donkeys and carrying shoulder poles.
0:6:44|0:6:50|For those who made it in time, the donkey was still carrying pots, pans, tables, and chairs on its back, essential items for life, protruding two people high.
0:6:52|0:6:59|The person who was in a hurry could only pick up important items and stuff them into a cloth bag, then quickly leave.
0:6:59|0:7:7|Among the refugees fleeing their homes, the mother simply put her two or three-year-old child on a shoulder pole and ran, fearing to waste time.
0:7:7|0:7:13|If there were no children, they would tie several chickens and ducks to a carrying pole to use as a weapon during their escape.
0:7:13|0:7:18|[Lujian Xiong] stood beside the stone steps at the city gate, looking down at the hurried refugees fleeing.
0:7:24|0:7:27|After a period of chaos, the city temporarily calmed down.
0:7:27|0:7:31|Suddenly, a carter drove a yellow carriage against the traffic into the city.
0:7:31|0:7:35|In the back of the yellow van, there is a tattered flagpole.
0:7:35|0:7:39|The flag is surrounded by a circle, with a cross right in the center.
0:7:40|0:7:58|In the same yellow van, there are a total of four. The first van is occupied by a middle-aged woman with short curly hair and wearing pearl earrings. The second van is occupied by a young girl who looks similar to her, and in her arms, there is a little girl who is about three or four years old. They all curiously look around.
0:8:1|0:8:12|Seeing the crowd of people coming in the opposite direction and the fleeing villagers, several children curiously looked on, but before they could take a closer look, they were loudly yelled at by their father to leave quickly.
0:8:12|0:8:19|Not far away, several Japanese soldiers holding long spears were curiously searching for something on the street.
0:8:19|0:8:25|Passing by a small tavern that had long been unrecognizable, one of the soldiers suddenly had a bright idea.
0:8:28|0:8:33|As the soldier was about to open the cap of the glass bottle, he was loudly stopped by the Japanese officer.
0:8:33|0:8:38|Watching the officer walk away, the soldiers couldn't wait and eagerly took big gulps.
0:8:41|0:8:49|After receiving a positive answer, the companions quickly arrived at the shelf in front of the small tavern and picked up a bottle to drink quickly.
0:8:49|0:8:54|The Japanese officer turned around at the sound and asked in a deep voice.
0:9:1|0:9:9|The Japanese officer who was originally going to investigate suddenly saw a middle-aged man wearing a helmet riding a bicycle passing by.
0:9:9|0:9:13|Turning his head, Tang Tianxiang saw a car coming from the main road.
0:9:14|0:9:20|After shouting to no avail to stop the car, a soldier fired a warning shot into the air.
0:9:20|0:9:36|As the car came to a stop, a foreign old man in a suit and tie raised his hands high and walked towards the Japanese officer, asking if anyone could speak English. At the same time, he showed the flag on his arm to indicate that he was German.
0:9:36|0:9:40|Knowing that [Kadokawa Masao] could speak English, the Japanese officer asked him to approach and inquire about the elderly German man.
0:9:49|0:9:57|After [Kadokawa Masao] translated these words to everyone, a soldier suddenly laughed and said he also wanted to meet the general.
0:10:4|0:10:12|At this moment, the middle-aged man who got off the car with the elderly German man cautiously approached and spoke in Japanese.
0:10:13|0:10:22|Upon hearing his native language, Kadokawa Masao, the Japanese officer, immediately relaxed his furrowed brow, smiled at the two of them, holstered his gun, waved his hand, and then led the soldiers away from the area.
0:10:23|0:10:32|As soon as Ke Gang turned his head, a soldier suddenly noticed a figure flashing by the collapsed church near the clock tower in Qingdao.
0:10:32|0:10:40|The Japanese officer quickly raised his hand to signal, while pulling out a pistol from his waist, and slowly walked towards the church ahead.
0:10:40|0:10:47|The leather boots made a rustling sound as they stepped on the broken stones on the ground, while the soldiers clenched their teeth and loaded their rifles.
0:10:51|0:10:57|The door of the church was gently pushed open, and a group of women and children stood shoulder to shoulder, looking silently at the newcomer.
0:10:57|0:11:3|The sunlight shone through the broken window, revealing their current appearance.
0:11:3|0:11:11|The elderly people's once neat cotton-padded jackets were already tattered, their hair disheveled and hanging over their foreheads, their eyes sunken like dried-up wells.
0:11:11|0:11:17|The stick-like hand firmly grasped the child in front of him, and the next second he couldn't help but keep retreating repeatedly.
0:11:19|0:11:23|The [Japanese officer] had already strolled in front of everyone.
0:11:23|0:11:28|The child was suddenly overwhelmed by the silence and couldn't help but burst into tears.
0:11:28|0:11:36|Then, in the crowd, an old man with a beard raised his hands above his head first, and then others followed suit one after another.
0:11:36|0:11:42|At that moment, the raised hands of the people actually blocked the sunlight from the church outside.
0:11:42|0:11:47|In the crowd, several injured soldiers were in tears, raising their long spears above their heads.
0:11:49|0:11:57|Seeing this scene in front of him, [Kadokawa Masao] put down his gun, but the other soldiers still held their guns upright, aiming at the unarmed civilians.
0:12:20|0:12:22|So he whispered to [Kadokawa Masao].
0:12:25|0:12:36|[Kadokawa Masao] pretended to be calm, tightened the long spear in his hand, nodded slightly, then quickly backed out of the church after scanning the crowd.
0:12:36|0:12:40|At this moment, on the wide street, [Kadokawa Masao] shouted loudly to attract his companions.
0:12:45|0:12:55|After hearing the sound, a group of Japanese soldiers rushed from all directions and rang the assembly bell.
0:12:55|0:13:5|Over there, [Kadokawa Masao] was the first to see the companions emerging from the broken building, and quickly pointed towards the church.
0:13:5|0:13:8|Before long, a team of nearly a hundred people gathered outside the church.
0:13:10|0:13:18|The first soldier to arrive was already standing on the stone pedestal at the top of the church, occasionally pointing his cold gun into the air.
0:13:18|0:13:24|A group of soldiers threatened women and children with guns, forcing them to crouch tightly together in the aisle of the church.
0:13:26|0:13:30|The men were lined up in rows, their hands tied, and driven separately towards the other side.
0:13:30|0:13:34|Counting in his mouth while rushing, he reached 140 when his feet hurriedly arrived.
0:13:42|0:13:50|Hearing the pleading voice of a woman, [Kadokawa Masao] was momentarily at a loss, holding his long spear and standing in place, looking around in confusion.
0:13:50|0:13:57|Suddenly, the women and children who were already squatting on the ground struggled to their feet, continuously pushing back the soldiers who were trying to maintain order.
0:14:1|0:14:4|Even Kadokawa Masao had just arrived with a gun when he heard several gunshots.
0:14:5|0:14:20|In front of them, a wooden door was pushed open, and the bodies of four or five young girls lay straight on the ground. The women and children who were pushing and struggling instantly erupted into heart-wrenching screams, trembling hands reaching out towards those bodies.
0:14:25|0:14:36|The soldier who fired the gun now clutched his long rifle, stepping back while muttering that it was not intentional. His feet were rooted to the spot, but his eyes involuntarily glanced at the old woman crying in front of him.
0:14:36|0:14:48|As she was rummaging through her backpack, her companion quickly grabbed her arm and pulled her up, then nervously supported her and hurriedly elbowed their way out with a long spear.
0:15:0|0:15:5|The youngest girl on the yellow van hurriedly ran into the man's arms.
0:15:13|0:15:22|And [Tang Tianxiang] is the man who is in the same car as the elderly German.
0:15:28|0:15:35|[Tang Tianxiang] set down his young daughter and then suddenly embraced the woman tightly.
0:15:35|0:15:37|This must be Mrs. Tang.
0:15:53|0:16:3|At this moment, in the city center, several Japanese soldiers are tying iron chains around the full-body bronze statue of [Jiang Jieshi].
0:16:3|0:16:9|But with a command from the officer, several soldiers worked together, and the bronze statue leaped straight off the stone platform, smashing towards the ground.
0:16:11|0:16:20|Next, a soldier leaped onto the stone platform, vigorously waving the flagpole in his hands, and the Japanese national flag fluttered freely in the center of the city.
0:16:20|0:16:31|The rest of the soldiers were still not satisfied, so they immediately took down the flag symbolizing the Kuomintang, covered it on Kadokawa Masao's statue, then pulled down the statue and cheered as they walked away.
0:16:31|0:16:39|On the other end of the city, a group of Japanese soldiers with guns arrived on the main road, while a soldier holding a camera would occasionally take pictures of his companions.
0:16:40|0:16:50|After destroying the statue of [Jiang Jieshi], the Japanese officers excitedly took out their cameras to take a group photo.
0:16:50|0:17:1|At this moment, a soldier saw a tank on the street and was about to throw a grenade at it, but was stopped by his comrade, saying that the tank was still functional and could be left for the troops behind.
0:17:1|0:17:5|He then shouted that the area was safe, and immediately jumped off the tank, with the alliance following the main force.
0:17:8|0:17:18|Who knew that as they had just walked a short distance, the tank suddenly turned its turret, and the bullets from the machine gun inside rained down like a storm, crazily shooting towards a group of Japanese soldiers.
0:17:18|0:17:22|The fragments of broken weaving scattered on the main road of the city in an instant.
0:17:22|0:17:30|The Japanese officer hurriedly crawled under the attack accumulated in the sack, the five helmets that had just been knocked off due to escape, and then the fire asked.
0:17:32|0:17:40|A soldier forced his head out, squinted his eyes, and through the layers of smoke, he saw someone shooting on a tall building not far away.
0:17:40|0:17:46|As soon as Ke Gang mentioned the enemy was above, a bullet from behind pierced through his heart.
0:17:46|0:17:53|From a distance, a bullet shot from an unknown location hit another Japanese soldier right between the eyes on a taller building.
0:17:54|0:18:1|Shortly after, the thrown grenade exploded near the fortifications, instantly killing several Japanese soldiers.
0:18:1|0:18:7|Kadokawa Masao, who was originally hiding at the corner of the street, heard the call of the Japanese officer. Without hesitation, he bent over and rushed towards the officer.
0:18:9|0:18:18|On the high-rise building, the militiamen arrived at the gunmen with hand grenades in their baskets, secretly placing one down before moving to the next cover.
0:18:30|0:18:42|Upstairs, [Shun Zi] is handing a grenade to the soldier next to her, but the next second, a Japanese soldier emerges from the edge of the wall, bypasses the obstacles, and shoots down the soldier on the third floor with one shot.
0:18:42|0:18:50|[Liu Jianxiong] over here has a little boy helping out, who quickly reloads all the sniper ammunition. He picks it up, aims downstairs, and takes a shot to the head.
0:18:52|0:19:5|Preparing for another ambush, suddenly hearing a noise coming from the stairs, [Tang Tianxiang] swiftly moved, leaning against the wall near the stairs, dropped a grenade, and then turned to shoot at the incoming person.
0:19:5|0:19:11|After eliminating the Japanese soldiers at the staircase, [Tang Tianxiang] quickly ordered [Shun Zi] nearby to take people down to observe.
0:19:11|0:19:18|Just as he reached the bottom of the stairs, a soldier who hadn't even steadied himself was shot in the forehead. [Lu Jianxiong]'s gun also suddenly jammed.
0:19:22|0:19:30|The seven or eight-year-old boy quickly slung the sniper rifle on his back upon hearing this, then crouched down and dragged the barrel, carefully handing it over to [Lu Jianxiong].
0:19:32|0:19:37|[Liu Jianxiong] quickly loaded the gun, leaped down, and leaned against the corner of the second floor.
0:19:37|0:19:48|Glancing at Shun Zi crouching at the first floor staircase, Tang Tianxiang took out a grenade, gestured for him to throw it outside, then stood next to the window on the second floor, firing at the Japanese soldiers below.
0:19:48|0:19:58|Seeing the leading Japanese soldier already diving under his feet, [Tang Tianxiang] turned around on the spot, hugged his sniper rifle, and jumped into the entrance of the first floor, cleanly and neatly eliminating the threat.
0:20:2|0:20:19|At this moment, the explosives buried in front of the building suddenly erupted. The Japanese soldiers who had been emerging like spring bamboo shoots quickly disappeared. Just as the Japanese soldier who was about to ring the bell for reinforcements was blown up, our soldiers ended his life with a single shot.
0:20:19|0:20:35|In the street surrounded by buildings, Japanese soldiers were still stubbornly attacking. Thinking they could take cover behind the building in front of them, but the next second, a shot of anger from behind instantly blew their heads open.
0:20:35|0:20:36|For a while, there were no more gunshots.
0:20:39|0:20:44|On the opposite high-rise building, several soldiers raised their long spears and cheered loudly, as Tang Tianxiang looked on.
0:20:44|0:20:52|Having reached the third floor, Tang Tianxiang finally relaxed, raised his sniper rifle, and gently aimed it at the opposite side.
0:20:52|0:21:1|The little boy, seeing the situation, quickly dropped the hemp rope, with one end tied to a basket containing a hand grenade, and the other end wrapped around the wall. After confirming it was secure, he used both hands and feet to slide down from the third floor.
0:21:2|0:21:16|The soldiers then cautiously emerged, even though they had won the battle, they did not dare to relax. The scout slowly made his way to the street, where corpses were scattered everywhere. Many people had already been disfigured beyond recognition, making it impossible to distinguish between friend and foe without a closer look.
0:21:16|0:21:21|Not far from the pile of corpses, the Japanese officer [Kadokawa Masao] was unscathed, hiding safely behind the wall.
0:21:22|0:21:29|The soldiers did not thoroughly search the dwarf before leaving in a hurry, thus saving his life.
0:21:29|0:21:36|On the other side, witnessing the tragic death of the sentry holding the bell, the surviving Japanese soldiers were caught off guard and quickly crouched beside them.
0:21:41|0:21:49|The scattered bodies everywhere easily deceived the soldiers of our army, so they quickly picked up the bullets scattered around and hurriedly left the scene.
0:21:49|0:21:56|Naturally, unnoticed by them, a trembling hand quietly picked up the bell behind them.
0:21:56|0:22:7|The warrior stood at the end of the road, [Lu Jianxiong] was sitting on the bricks resting. A little boy emerged from the alley, smiled at him, handed him a water bottle, then turned and ran towards his companions in the courtyard.
0:22:11|0:22:15|Two children take turns sitting in the pedicab, enjoying a moment of joy.
0:22:15|0:22:18|The next moment, the bell rang again.
0:22:20|0:22:27|The little boy's face changed, he quickly put on the helmet that didn't fit his head size, and ran to [Lu Jianxiong]'s side.
0:22:27|0:22:37|[Lujian Xiong] looked down at him, his angular face already tainted with sweat and gunpowder, casting a faint shadow, but suddenly, he smiled slightly.
0:22:37|0:22:48|Next, there came the sound of footsteps in front of him. [Lu Jianxiong] looked up and saw soldiers carrying long spears approaching. The young men who had temporarily joined the team also walked slowly with bullet bags hanging on their shoulders.
0:22:49|0:22:57|Lujianxiong's gaze swept over these faces one by one, and after looking for a while, suddenly stopped.
0:22:57|0:23:3|Suddenly, Shun Zi was missing from the crowd, and at that moment, Shun Zi happened to be hiding behind a wall.
0:23:3|0:23:8|Hearing the call of [Lu Jianxiong], he was so scared that he held onto his long spear tightly and quickly retreated to the corner.
0:23:18|0:23:24|Listening to the ringing bell, [Tang Tianxiang] lowered his head and murmured.
0:23:24|0:23:34|And [Shun Zi], upon hearing [Lu Jianxiong]'s words, quietly dodged away from the crowd, then immediately ran off, tearing off the military uniform on her body and throwing it behind her as she ran.
0:23:34|0:23:43|The rapid escape in a short period of time caused him to pant heavily in no time, but he didn't care about that, stumbling out of the main road and into a narrow alley.
0:23:44|0:23:50|On the other side, while Tang Tianxiang dispersed his brothers, he himself was prepared for battle.
0:23:50|0:24:8|Sitting on the window sill on the third floor, as he took out the few sniper bullets from his pocket, the little boy suddenly ran over from the side staircase and handed the scavenged sniper bullets to [Lu Jianxiong], then revealed the bullet bag wrapped around his chest, pulling out the bullets one by one from the separate small holes.
0:24:9|0:24:17|At this moment, the sound of a gun being cocked again came from the staircase. [Lu Jianxiong] placed the grenade on the windowsill and turned to look.
0:24:17|0:24:22|A group of soldiers crouched by the window with explosive bags on their backs, aiming at the main road in a hurry.
0:24:22|0:24:32|The other group of soldiers lowered baskets with hemp ropes from the fourth floor, and the people on the first floor quickly secured five or six long spears before swiftly pulling up the ropes, transporting the weapons in an orderly manner.
0:24:35|0:24:41|But at this moment, the Japanese reinforcements had already lined up in tanks and were attacking towards this location.
0:24:41|0:24:54|Seeing the situation turning against them, Japanese officer Kadokawa Masao hiding behind a low wall handed a sniper rifle to Tang Tianxiang, who was then seen aiming at the soldiers moving weapons outside the building and fired a shot.
0:24:54|0:25:0|The soldier hiding in the tank saw the Japanese tank that had already reached the fork in the road, and without hesitation, fired a fierce shot.
0:25:1|0:25:5|Who would have thought, there was also an enemy tank lurking at the other end.
0:25:5|0:25:14|After firing back, our soldier fell to the ground with blood all over his body, and in front of him were numerous Japanese soldiers rushing in for reinforcements.
0:25:14|0:25:21|Bullets exploded all over his body, causing Kadokawa Masao in the distance to tremble and close his eyes.
0:25:21|0:25:29|Immediately, the Japanese tanks opened fire on the building from a distance, taking the opportunity to sneak up on the Japanese soldiers under the building and repeatedly throwing grenades through the windows.
0:25:31|0:25:40|On one hand, shouting to kill all Chinese people, on the other hand, they brought a long wooden ladder and placed it by the window, then quickly climbed up to occupy the second floor position.
0:25:40|0:25:47|At the entrance of the small courtyard on the other side of the building, a 20-man team of Japanese soldiers brought two grenade launchers.
0:25:47|0:25:52|The knee-high grenade launcher may look ordinary, but its destructive power is surprisingly formidable.
0:25:53|0:25:58|Above the triangular support iron frame is a round disc handle used to adjust the height.
0:25:58|0:26:4|After the Japanese soldier quickly rotated, an iron launch tube piercing through the bottom frame emerged.
0:26:4|0:26:7|The diameter of the launch tube is about the size of an adult's palm.
0:26:7|0:26:13|Upon the command of the Japanese officer, the soldiers loaded the explosive grenades into the barrel.
0:26:13|0:26:20|The small hole at the bottom of the grenade hit the firing pin in the barrel, and after the two interacted instantly, the temperature inside the barrel immediately rose.
0:26:20|0:26:21|Under high pressure, the shell is fired out of the barrel.
0:26:22|0:26:26|He flew straight towards the building where [Lu Jianxiong] and others were located.
0:26:26|0:26:31|After a few shakes, the already crumbling building collapsed like flowing sand.
0:26:31|0:26:37|Under the suppression of machine guns from another team of Japanese soldiers, the soldiers crawling at the window couldn't even lift their heads.
0:26:39|0:26:43|The soldier who didn't have time to find cover lost his breath in the hail of bullets.
0:26:43|0:26:54|Suddenly, there was a silence all around. The next second, a figure walked out from the front door of the first floor, holding a piece of cloth high above the head and waving it gently.
0:26:54|0:26:59|Seeing the soldier surrender, the Japanese soldier immediately signaled his companion to take him away.
0:27:0|0:27:8|A large number of Japanese soldiers quickly arrived with their rifles raised high, and then conducted a thorough search of the building in front of them.
0:27:8|0:27:14|Kadokawa Masao arrived here after just leaving the church, only to find that the battle had already come to a temporary halt.
0:27:14|0:27:25|The first thing that catches the eye is the neatly arranged bodies of comrades on the ground, and the soldier kneeling on the ground, crying as he looks at the bodies.
0:27:25|0:27:29|Just as [Kadokawa Masao] was in a daze, a Japanese soldier in the crowd recognized him.
0:27:43|0:27:48|After bidding farewell to the soldier, [Kadokawa Masao] lowered his head and crossed the intersection, heading straight towards the gate of the building.
0:27:50|0:27:59|With another glance upwards, Tang Tianxiang hesitated slightly in his steps, involuntarily stopping at the railing outside the building, before lifting his foot again and moving forward.
0:27:59|0:28:10|The fighters who were fighting in the building earlier are now captured, with hemp ropes around their necks, their chests and abdomens forced to face the main road, tightly bound to the railing.
0:28:10|0:28:14|The little boy stood up straight, tied to a utility pole in the middle of the road.
0:28:15|0:28:21|After taking a few glances, Tang Tianxiang continued to walk forward, but couldn't help but turn back and look towards the courtyard.
0:28:21|0:28:30|Next to the wooden fence wrapped in layers of iron wire, [Lu Jianxiong] was also tied to the wall behind him. Ignoring the footsteps approaching him, a team of eight Japanese soldiers raised their long guns high.
0:28:33|0:28:34|So that his companions can take pictures with the camera.
0:29:7|0:29:12|At the sound of a gunshot, the four middle-aged civilians kneeling at the street corner with their backs to the Japanese soldiers fell to the ground.
0:29:13|0:29:17|And at this moment, [Kadokawa Masao] finally found his own large group of soldiers.
0:29:17|0:29:22|As the team slowly entered the city center, everything in front of him made his breathing quicken.
0:29:24|0:29:32|The once intact buildings were completely leveled in the war, and the unburned ground was littered with people's bodies in all directions.
0:29:32|0:29:38|Inexplicably, the common people walking on the road were mercilessly shot by other Japanese soldiers.
0:29:38|0:29:46|Until the next second, [Kadokawa Masao] could no longer resist the urge to open his eyes, staring blankly at the person in front of him, mechanically shifting.
0:29:46|0:29:58|In front of the slanted beam, there were countless heads hanging upside down, with dried blood solidified on their faces. Their mouths were unconsciously open, and their eyes were staring straight ahead.
0:29:58|0:30:8|The freshly spilled blood was gushing out from the neck of the victim, as if one could see wisps of steam rising in this cold winter day.
0:30:10|0:30:16|At this moment, [Lu Jianxiong] and other soldiers had their hands clamped behind their backs, being escorted to the city gate.
0:30:22|0:30:28|In front of the city gate cave, Japanese soldiers used iron wires and wooden fences to quickly enclose a rectangular concentration camp.
0:30:29|0:30:33|In the open camp, there were only cunning middle-aged men.
0:30:33|0:30:37|Upon seeing Tang Tianxiang and his group arrive, they all looked at them with dirty and disheveled faces.
0:30:37|0:30:42|Soon, [Lu Jianxiong] followed everyone over the fence and walked in slowly.
0:30:42|0:30:49|At this moment, the concentration camp was already overcrowded, so the Japanese soldiers kept shouting loudly, telling them to squeeze together.
0:30:50|0:30:56|Then he ordered everyone to squat down in place, while Japanese soldiers with long rifles patrolled outside the wooden fence.
0:30:56|0:31:1|As the number of people in the camp grew, one of them shouted loudly.
0:31:3|0:31:8|In the crouching line, suddenly a figure bent over and sneaked towards [Lu Jianxiong].
0:31:8|0:31:15|Dai Qi stood next to [Lu Jianxiong], and only when she looked up did she realize that it was the little boy who had handed him the sniper bullet in the building.
0:31:17|0:31:27|The little boy showed no fear at all, just staring firmly at [Lu Jianxiong] until he gently touched his head with his forehead, then the boy opened his mouth and smiled.
0:31:27|0:31:35|At the same time, on the rural country road outside the city, middle-aged men lined up in groups of four, forming a team that stretched for hundreds of miles.
0:31:36|0:31:52|In the city, inside the factory that had been bombed into an unrecognizable shape, several Japanese soldiers were holding wooden boards and hammering on the windows and doors of the factory. Meanwhile, other Japanese soldiers were pouring gasoline from barrels into various corners of the factory.
0:31:52|0:31:58|In front of the concentration camp in Chengmendong, Tang Tianxiang and other middle-aged men who were detained had to stand up when they heard the order.
0:32:0|0:32:10|The crowd surged, stirring up the already murky air, making it hard to breathe for a moment, with the smell of gunfire permeating the air.
0:32:10|0:32:22|In the biting cold wind, the men's hands were clamped behind their backs, looking ahead at the Japanese soldiers with their shoulders.
0:32:30|0:32:39|In another concentration camp, Japanese soldiers issued the same order.
0:32:39|0:32:47|Japanese soldiers outside the fence are spaced 5 meters apart, holding long guns and threatening everyone.
0:32:47|0:32:54|Even towards the elderly, Japanese soldiers showed no mercy, shouting loudly and urging them to walk faster.
0:32:54|0:32:59|Soon, the men who were imprisoned in various concentration camps in the city were sent away in batches from their original location.
0:33:0|0:33:5|The first group of people staggered into the abandoned factory in the city.
0:33:5|0:33:15|The factory now, except for the wide open gate that only allows one person in and out, has been completely destroyed by artillery fire, and the walls have been firmly nailed with boards horizontally and vertically.
0:33:15|0:33:25|The large troop, which had been trekking through the outskirts with difficulty, now slowly arrived at a reed marsh. They stopped in front of the muddy river.
0:33:25|0:33:36|The third group of people were divided into groups of about ten people each, and under the leadership of Japanese soldiers, they lined up in order and stood in the already dug trenches.
0:33:36|0:33:49|The fourth group of people stayed in the city, outside the concentration camp, where Japanese soldiers formed a circle and used long ropes to encircle about 50 people. The people stood with their arms hanging at their sides, watching as the ropes tightly constricted their chests.
0:33:49|0:34:9|On the other side, the men in the factory had their hemp ropes cut off, and after the Japanese soldiers locked the gate, they quickly gathered by the makeshift window made of wooden boards, curiously watching the Japanese soldiers outside spreading gasoline.
0:34:9|0:34:14|At this moment, the Japanese soldiers escorting the different batches of prisoners simultaneously issued orders.
0:34:14|0:34:21|At the factory, buckets of gasoline were continuously splashed onto the wooden boards nailed to the wall, even on the men's bodies.
0:34:21|0:34:24|In front of the pit, ten Japanese soldiers lined up and committed suicide with their swords.
0:34:27|0:34:37|The first group of civilians ordered to turn back were met with Japanese soldiers behind them, firing machine guns mercilessly.
0:34:37|0:34:42|Bullets alternated from left to right, mercilessly piercing through the bodies of the people from behind.
0:34:42|0:34:52|The next moment, the bodies surged forward like a landslide, burning with gasoline alone at the factory was not enough, and multiple grenades were quickly thrown in through a palm-wide wooden board.
0:34:53|0:35:14|The situation near the pit was even more unspeakable. The people were divided into two groups: one group stood in the pit, being stabbed in the chest and abdomen by the Japanese soldiers' samurai swords, while the other group was kicked into a deep pit nearly two people high. Then, handfuls of soil were thrown at them, covering them alive.
0:35:14|0:35:34|Near the Duto Road, Japanese soldiers found amusement at this moment. In front of the civilians was only the icy lake, while behind them were the hot barrels of machine guns. In order to survive, in the bone-chilling winter, they had to run towards the center of the lake. The bullets fired randomly did not travel far, entering people's brains in an instant.
0:35:34|0:35:40|The eyes were squeezed out of their sockets, and then the entire head exploded, leaving the flesh and skin in the well still trembling.
0:35:41|0:35:42|If you say so.
0:35:49|0:35:57|Reality is cruel. Under the massacre, bloodstains on the lakeside mixed with the lake water, spreading to the center of the lake.
0:35:57|0:36:8|Looking up the road where they came from, the reed marsh that was fluttering in the wind just a second ago is now soaked with blood, bending over in sorrow. Everywhere is a crowd of people who died tragically, making it impossible to step on.
0:36:9|0:36:19|[Lujian Xiong] A group of people in the concentration camp heard the deafening gunshots and quickly turned their heads to look, but the next moment, they were greeted by Japanese soldiers waving flags and riding horses.
0:36:37|0:36:41|Perhaps having a premonition, not a single person in the crowd stood up.
0:36:41|0:36:48|Japanese soldiers quickly raised their guns to warn them when they saw this.
0:36:48|0:36:57|Three people fell down in the crowd.
0:36:57|0:37:0|However, no one stood up.
0:37:0|0:37:3|The unknown fear swallowed the courage of the men.
0:37:4|0:37:16|Hearing the sound of gunfire around him, [Lu Jianxiong] turned his head to look at the young boy, then lowered his head to see a commoner's wrist nearby with a removed hemp rope.
0:37:16|0:37:25|Suddenly, everything around him made the most fractured part of his soul clear, inexplicable but he just stood up abruptly.
0:37:25|0:37:30|And at the moment he stood up, the random shots fired by the Japanese soldiers into the crowd also ceased.
0:37:31|0:37:37|After staring at the city gate for a while, Tang Tianxiang resolutely turned around and looked at everyone.
0:37:37|0:37:47|The blood that was originally left on the cheeks has now dried up on the face, the military uniform is already tattered, and the cotton has fallen out from the back shoulder.
0:37:47|0:37:52|In front of him, no one dared to meet his gaze, squatting on the ground and staring firmly at his feet.
0:37:53|0:38:4|Seeing this, [Lu Jianxiong] had no choice but to slowly turn around, while four or five Japanese soldiers under the city gate were already standing outside the fence, glaring at him with ropes in their hands.
0:38:4|0:38:9|With [Lu Jianxiong]'s hands still hidden behind him, he strides towards the Japanese soldier.
0:38:9|0:38:14|The little boy looked at his back, expressionless but with a gleam in his eyes.
0:38:15|0:38:20|Staggering to his feet, he quickly caught up with the pace of Tang Tianxiang.
0:38:20|0:38:30|Watching as the little boy, not even as tall as [Lu Jianxiong]'s waist, dashed out, the people behind him began to waver.
0:38:30|0:38:35|With his eyes squinted, the burly man in military uniform gritted his teeth and was the first to get up from the ground.
0:38:35|0:38:40|Then another soldier, his face covered in blood and looking slightly weaker, also followed up.
0:38:41|0:38:47|Following that, the man dressed as a scholarly type also stood up forcefully and closely followed behind.
0:38:47|0:38:55|The whole crowd was thus mobilized, shoulder to shoulder, marching towards the Japanese soldier.
0:38:55|0:39:2|Walking at the front of the team, [Lu Jianxiong] did not look back, but from the slight trembling of his lips, it seemed that his heart was undergoing great turmoil.
0:39:3|0:39:15|And following behind him were his teammates who were fighting together in the building, but on the expressionless face of one teammate, a hidden sadness suddenly emerged.
0:39:15|0:39:25|He turned his head towards the side of the fence, where a Japanese soldier with a long gun raised was threatening, then quickened his pace, following Tang Tianxiang's steps without hesitation.
0:39:25|0:39:32|But as the crowd moved closer to the city gate, a sense of helplessness seemed to overcome each person, gradually dissipating with each step forward.
0:39:34|0:39:44|Approaching on the train is a proud and fearless figure with a determined and courageous look.
0:39:44|0:39:54|Before long, people walked out of the concentration camp. As soon as they stepped into the city gate, they were dazzled for a second by the screen in front of them.
0:39:54|0:40:0|In the distance, you can see a squad of about 50 Japanese soldiers in the sentry post, holding long guns and waiting in formation.
0:40:3|0:40:10|Although unable to see their faces, the wolf-like eyes pierced through the misty haze straight towards Tang Tianxiang and the others.
0:40:15|0:40:26|At this moment, looking further back behind the Japanese soldiers, one could only vaguely see flags fluttering, with tanks and soldiers' figures stretching out into the distance.
0:40:26|0:40:34|When Tang Tianxiang turned left away from the checkpoint, he withdrew his gaze, but the next second, two scorching glances shot straight at him.
0:40:34|0:40:40|During the intense battle in the building, the Japanese officer hiding behind the wall was glaring fiercely at [Lu Jianxiong] by the barbed wire.
0:40:42|0:40:49|But Tang Tianxiang paid no attention at all, instead staring blankly at the barren land in front of him to his right.
0:40:49|0:41:0|Endless corpses were piled up haphazardly on the ground, some as high as half a calf. The already desolate land strangely softened under the irrigation of blood.
0:41:0|0:41:7|Everyone looked at the scene in front of them, feeling a chill coming from their foreheads, as if it could be described as a purgatory on earth.
0:41:9|0:41:19|At this moment, the little boy emerged from behind [Tang Tianxiang], spat out the hemp rope from [Tang Tianxiang]'s wrist, and then gently leaned against him, feeling a slight tremor in front of him.
0:41:19|0:41:26|[Lujian Xiong] lowered his head, raised his right hand to rest on the shoulder of the young boy, and covered his eyes with his left hand.
0:41:26|0:41:28|Then, a loud noise was heard coming from behind.
0:42:2|0:42:9|The machine gun stopped again, and Tang Tianxiang's group was exposed directly under the muzzle.
0:42:9|0:42:19|In the office of another school in Nanjing City, the teachers with cross armbands on their arms stopped their work instantly when they heard the sound of gunshots.
0:42:19|0:42:27|A female teacher with short curly hair hurriedly put on a fur coat and held a candlestick as she came to the window.
0:42:27|0:42:36|In a dormitory full of girls, the girls huddled closely together, as if sensing something, they hugged each other's shoulders and silently lowered their heads.
0:42:36|0:42:41|On the other side, in the attic of the house, [Mrs. Tang] held her sister [Little Sister] and looked out the window with great concern.
0:42:47|0:43:5|At this moment, a Japanese officer in a windbreaker with a samurai sword hanging from his waist stepped onto the temporary wooden platform with a machine gun. By the lake, the chilly wind gently moved his coat as he lowered his head in satisfaction, overlooking everything in front of him.
0:43:5|0:43:15|Under the sweeping of machine guns, batch after batch of civilians were pressed on the originally lush reed marshes, the nearly 500-meter long bank had long been unbalanced.
0:43:15|0:43:21|Fortunately, at the time of the massacre, there were photos and written records from foreign friends, so we knew the most authentic situation at that time.
0:43:23|0:43:32|From December 12th to December 18th, 1937, within a week after the fall of Nanjing, all the prisoners were massacred.
0:43:32|0:43:36|Other Chinese refugees in Nanjing city began to seek help.
0:43:36|0:43:46|Mr. Rabe, the elderly German man who previously rode in a sedan, established the International Safety Zone, which became the place where the people of Nanjing urgently sought refuge.
0:43:48|0:43:58|Hearing that the safe zone could ensure their safety, people crowded in like bees, with the iron gate wide open, and the common folks squeezed in eagerly.
0:43:58|0:44:5|The safe zone could not accommodate such a large crowd at once, so the police had to press against the gate to maintain order.
0:44:5|0:44:9|[Shun Zi] took a different path, running out through a rarely guarded iron fence.
0:44:24|0:44:29|The people who have entered the safe zone are then led to their designated beds in the church.
0:44:29|0:44:34|The woman in a sweater coat is picking up cotton clothes with the girls on the street.
0:44:38|0:44:46|The sudden sound of gunshots startled everyone at the horse ranch. The woman, who is [Xiao Jiang] the teacher, quickly ushered the children back to the safety of the tent area.
0:44:46|0:44:57|Bending down, hiding beside the fence next to a burlap sack, revealing a pair of bright eyes, staring intently at the figure of the Japanese soldier.
0:44:57|0:45:3|But in the chaos, [Xiao Jiang] brought over wooden boards and sealed up all the windows of the girls' dormitory.
0:45:3|0:45:6|On the other side, Tang Tianxiang finally stopped at his destination.
0:45:8|0:45:12|Outside the city gate, bodies were scattered on the dried-up path like garbage.
0:45:12|0:45:18|Shun Zi flipped over the bodies one by one, until he finally saw a familiar face.
0:45:18|0:45:24|[Lujian Xiong] stared ahead with wide eyes, but his whole body had already stiffened.
0:45:24|0:45:33|[Shun Zi] held back her tears, reached out with her right hand to gently close [Lu Jianxiong]'s eyes, then dragged him by the armpits and placed him next to the other warriors.
0:45:35|0:45:43|Suddenly, the dead beard lifted a head, leaned in to take a closer look, and it turned out to be the little boy held in the arms of [Lu Jianxiong].
0:45:43|0:45:49|The little boy lay on the ground, panting heavily as he straightened his body, looking around and swallowing hard to suppress the palpitations in his chest.
0:45:56|0:46:1|The man crouching in front of the little boy suddenly woke up, panting heavily.
0:46:1|0:46:4|Finally, the two were brought back to the safe zone by [Shun Zi].
0:46:4|0:46:7|Next, Teacher [Xiao Jiang] placed them in a room.
0:46:18|0:46:32|Sitting on the wall, Teacher [Xiao Jiang] gently embraced the little boy, holding back tears as she took off his tattered cap.
0:46:32|0:46:36|At noon, Japanese soldiers by the lake set up reed poles and played a game of high jump.
0:46:45|0:46:48|[Kadokawa Masao] brought a bucket of water and was rubbing the back of a Japanese officer.
0:46:54|0:47:4|Upon hearing Kadokawa Masao express his desire to eat stewed yam, the Japanese officer quickly praised it, saying Kadokawa Masao's mother made it very delicious.
0:47:8|0:47:12|Because Kadokawa Masao is a talented and knowledgeable person, the higher-ups are considering promoting Kadokawa Masao.
0:47:14|0:47:27|At the lakeside not far from the two, several Japanese soldiers sat in a circle, watching the soldier in the middle pick up a towel and dance happily.
0:47:41|0:47:51|The next day, [Kadokawa Masao] arrived at a small courtyard with a sign for the Imperial Army rest area, carrying clean clothes. A middle-aged woman in a kimono, [Jiang Shuyun], who was strong and robust, quickly came forward to greet him.
0:47:57|0:47:59|[Kadokawa Masao] stood by the sign marked with number 3.
0:48:1|0:48:5|Opening the curtains first, the sight that greets the eyes is the bare back of [Baihe Zi].
0:48:5|0:48:18|She first squatted in front of the basin at the end of the bed, washed herself below, then casually took a towel and wrapped it around her body, and then lay down on the simple single bed skillfully.
0:48:18|0:48:26|Tang Tianxiang slowly takes off his shoes, placing his coat on the chair next to him, then pulls out a condom from his pants pocket.
0:48:26|0:48:30|Baihe Zi on the bed looked at her feet that she couldn't face, and sat up gently.
0:48:34|0:48:44|Kadokawa Masao, who had already taken off his pants but was struggling to put on a condom, glanced down at Baihe Zi to his left, then awkwardly placed the item in his hand.
0:48:44|0:48:53|As soon as [Baihe Zi] touched him, [Kadokawa Masao] unexpectedly began to tremble uncontrollably, and quickly shut his eyes.
0:48:53|0:49:1|Suddenly, he quickly apologized and immediately squatted down, covering his naked lower body with the military coat hanging on the side.
0:49:2|0:49:7|When she finally calmed down, she kept avoiding the direct gaze coming from [Baihe Zi].
0:49:25|0:49:32|As she sat down and spoke, a strand of hair gently fell from Baihe Zi's forehead, prompting Kadokawa Masao to summon up the courage to stand up from the edge of the bed.
0:49:34|0:49:44|Upon hearing the gentle words, Kadokawa Masao sat on the outer edge of the bed, slowly unbuttoned his shirt one by one, then turned around, lifted his head to face Baihe Zi.
0:49:44|0:49:58|Baihe Zi quickly removed the towel draped over herself, took [Kadokawa Masao]'s hand and wrapped it around his neck, then knelt straight in front of him, leaning down to steady his lips, swayed by this softness, [Kadokawa Masao]'s body slowly leaned towards him.
0:50:7|0:50:13|And [Baihe Zi] also extended her hands in the gentle whisper, pulling him in front of her with a low voice.
0:50:13|0:50:17|After a moment of boredom, [Kadokawa Masao] walked out in military uniform.
0:50:25|0:50:27|That Japanese soldier heard Kadokawa Masao say.
0:50:27|0:50:28|He will marry [Baihe Zi] in the future.
0:50:35|0:50:37|Then he added.
0:50:42|0:50:51|On the other side, in the lobby of the safe zone, Tang Tianxiang, Mrs. Tang, and a group of women were lighting candles and playing mahjong.
0:50:51|0:50:54|[Tang Tianxiang] then taught everyone how to say the word "friend" in Japanese.
0:51:1|0:51:3|But now everyone's attention is focused only on the card table.
0:51:35|0:51:44|[Tang Tianxiang] lied to his daughter on his back, then followed the sound alone, carrying a kerosene lamp, to the corner of the stairs on the first floor of the safe zone.
0:51:44|0:51:53|As soon as he turned around, Tang Tianxiang saw several Japanese soldiers assaulting a girl on the table.
0:51:53|0:52:0|Mr. Tang rushed up to the second floor with his legs spread apart, colliding with [Jiang Shuyun] and a foreign woman who had just come out of the dormitory.
0:52:3|0:52:11|The foreign woman was stunned in place as she stepped into the lobby on the first floor, then she rushed straight towards the Japanese soldier who was being released from prison.
0:52:11|0:52:21|[Xiao Jiang] took the opportunity to pull the girl off the table, but the frightened girl was already unable to distinguish the situation. She quickly covered her naked body and frantically shouted, "No, no!"
0:52:36|0:52:40|It was only then that they realized the one who committed the beastly act was the Japanese officer.
0:52:46|0:52:51|Then he smirked and said to them, "We are all friends," before ordering the team to disband.
0:52:58|0:53:3|Hearing Mr. Tang's response, she asked him what he did.
0:53:3|0:53:10|Mr. Tang smiled and took out a piece of paper from his jacket pocket, indicating that he was Mr. Rabe's secretary.
0:53:10|0:53:16|The Japanese officer glanced at it, then pinched the paper and walked towards the gate, pulling up his pants as he walked.
0:53:16|0:53:21|Before leaving, Tang Tianxiang quickly glanced at the girl lying on the bed.
0:53:28|0:53:33|Mr. Rabe looked at the girl held in the arms of [Xiao Jiang] and asked softly,
0:53:33|0:53:40|Tonight, several children were raped. After [Teacher Jiang] answered that there were six, everyone in the room hung their heads in sorrow.
0:53:40|0:53:47|Back in the attic, [Tang Tianxiang] stood by the window in silence for a while, then picked up a pair of scissors and forcefully pressed [Mrs. Tang] to sit on a wooden stool.
0:53:48|0:53:56|Feeling the trembling of the person beneath him, [Tang Tianxiang] couldn't bear it, but the next second, the scissors still went straight for [Mrs. Tang]'s hair.
0:53:56|0:54:1|With one swift stroke, the carefully styled permed hair was mercilessly cut off.
0:54:1|0:54:4|[Mrs. Tang] was in tears, trying to hold back her disheveled hair.
0:54:15|0:54:26|The ruthless and emotionless scissors danced back and forth in the hands of [Tang Tianxiang], losing its soul completely in this lifetime of trimming.
0:54:26|0:54:39|The next morning, to the sound of bells, almost all the women in the safe zone had changed overnight. They lined up neatly and walked towards the courtyard, with their hair cut short above the ears.
0:54:42|0:54:44|Except for the hair, the nails and lipstick have also become the focus of grooming.
0:55:16|0:55:26|Hearing the sarcasm from the prostitute [Xiao Jiang], Mrs. Tang, who is in the same safety committee as [Jiang Shuyun], immediately changed her expression.
0:55:26|0:55:32|Mrs. Tang immediately pressed Xiao Jiang down on the bench in the courtyard after listening to Jiang Shuyun's instructions.
0:55:32|0:55:38|[Xiao Jiang] shook the curly hair on her shoulders, took out scissors without asking the hairdresser behind her, and rushed out straight away.
0:55:39|0:55:51|On the other side, the children playing ran out of the safety zone's gate and bumped into two Japanese soldiers discussing their plans.
0:55:51|0:56:0|Seeing his comrade intentionally yelling at the children, the Japanese soldier with a long spear grinned, squatted in front of a little girl, touched her head, and said, "Don't be afraid."
0:56:2|0:56:9|Then like performing a magic trick, he pulled out two candies from his pocket, and the children instantly burst into laughter.
0:56:9|0:56:18|He then held the hand of the little girl and walked briskly with her through the gate of the safe zone, while his companion, holding a dog and pushing a bicycle, followed behind.
0:56:19|0:56:27|At this moment, the people cooking at the roadside stalls in the safety zone stopped their activities as they watched the Japanese soldiers swagger in.
0:56:36|0:56:39|They arrived at the flag-raising platform in the courtyard.
0:56:39|0:56:45|The Japanese soldier with a long spear on his back looked up and then waved away the little girl's hand, signaling her to leave.
0:56:45|0:56:52|The people in the safe zone did not react in time, and the two of them directly tore the cross flag that symbolized the safe zone into pieces.
0:56:52|0:57:3|When Mrs. Tang and the other staff in the safe zone realized something was wrong and rushed out, they could only see the two of them riding the bicycle away.
0:57:3|0:57:8|Teacher [Xiao Jiang] noticed something was wrong and quickly ran through the small path in the safe zone.
0:57:8|0:57:9|But who would have known,
0:57:9|0:57:13|Armed and well-organized Japanese soldiers had already been lurking outside the main gate.
0:57:13|0:57:19|The group of Japanese soldiers saw the young teacher [Xiao Jiang], and instantly huddled around him, holding him tightly in front of them.
0:57:19|0:57:29|Everyone rushed to touch hands with Teacher [Xiao Jiang], while the other employees who had run out before Teacher [Xiao Jiang] were already firmly pressed to their knees on the ground.
0:57:29|0:57:40|At this moment, chaos had also erupted in the courtyard. The women, who were powerless, could only see the evil gleam in the eyes of the Japanese soldiers as they pounced towards them.
0:57:40|0:57:49|Kneeling outside the gate, Teacher [Xiao Jiang] and some foreign staff from the safe zone could only listen to the Japanese soldiers' mockery, saying that they had finally fallen into the trap.
0:57:49|0:57:56|Without the presence of Teacher [Xiao Jiang] and others, the girls who have disguised themselves as boys as much as possible are now like lambs to the slaughter.
0:57:57|0:58:5|Four or five Japanese soldiers rushed into the dormitory, quickly pinning the girl down on the bed without a word, dividing the work among themselves in perfect coordination.
0:58:5|0:58:18|But when the girl's limbs were all forcefully suppressed, the leader knelt on top of her, tore apart her cotton jacket, and then vigorously removed her pants, enjoying it splendidly amidst the girl's crying.
0:58:20|0:58:24|The tormenting time passed, and the Japanese soldiers finally left in disgust.
0:58:24|0:58:33|As [Teacher Jiang] was being helped into the courtyard by foreign staff, she saw a girl jump from a height in front of her.
0:58:33|0:58:40|She then rushed into the girls' dormitory like a madwoman, only to find a group of girls in tattered clothes, crying uncontrollably.
0:58:43|0:58:52|At this moment, [Jiang Shuyun] noticed [Xiao Jiang] sitting by the window in a daze, and as she approached, she realized his situation was very bad.
0:58:52|0:59:5|Xiao Jiang's legs could barely come together on the bed frame, but the fist-sized wound on his knees was oozing fresh blood, and his veins were bulging as he tightly gripped the coat draped over him.
0:59:5|0:59:11|Sensing that [Jiang Shuyun] had placed her hand on him, [Xiao Jiang] raised his eyelids and regained his composure.
0:59:15|0:59:22|The winter grew colder, Kadokawa Masao, wearing a heavy coat, knocked on Baihe Zi's door once again.
0:59:25|0:59:35|Upon hearing Baihe Zi weakly responding with "Happy New Year," Kadokawa Masao's originally upturned mouth corners instantly drooped.
0:59:35|0:59:37|[Kadokawa Masao] said joyfully.
0:59:38|0:59:43|Baihe Zi didn't hesitate at all, lying weakly on the bed, and directly opened her legs.
0:59:47|0:59:48|Kadokawa had no choice but to speak.
0:59:52|0:59:53|Baihe Zi asked, looking up.
0:59:56|1:0:3|Seeing [Kadokawa Masao] taking out a cloth bag from behind, [Baihe Zi] slowly rose from the bed and struggled to sit up.
1:0:3|1:0:7|[Kadokawa Masao] also carefully handed over the bag.
1:0:7|1:0:13|Under the expectant gaze of [Kadokawa Masao], [Baihe Zi] placed the bag on her smooth thighs.
1:0:13|1:0:20|It was as if he had touched something, and he quickly untied the rope wrapped around the cloth bag layer by layer.
1:0:20|1:0:22|A round iron can appears.
1:0:25|1:0:28|There are still many candies in the canned food box.
1:0:28|1:0:39|[Baihe Zi] finally got excited at this moment, hurriedly unwrapped the candy wrapper, and then carefully put the transparent candy into her mouth.
1:0:39|1:0:47|Baihe Zi was like a child, praising how sweet it was while eating, then rummaging through the bag. Suddenly, she froze.
1:0:50|1:0:57|The tea snack made of red beans and flour, unique to the taste of spring, is emitting a faint sweet fragrance.
1:0:57|1:1:1|Jia Chuan, seeing the childlike contentment of [Baihe Zi], also became excited.
1:1:1|1:1:8|He turned around again and took out a bottle of sake from his bag, dripping it over.
1:1:8|1:1:14|[Baihe Zi] joyfully held the wine in front of her nose, then couldn't wait to take a deep breath.
1:1:42|1:1:51|The foot hesitated for a moment, carefully pronounced his own name, but [Baihe Zi] seemed to have no reaction, just smiling and spreading her legs.
1:1:51|1:1:55|Seeing the situation, [Tang Tianxiang] could only purse his lips and say "okay" before settling down.
1:2:8|1:2:18|Two Japanese soldiers, Kadokawa Masao and Tang Tianxiang, whose memories were erased early on, were dancing on the main road in the safety zone.
1:2:18|1:2:27|Seeing Tang Tianxiang passing by, she stopped him directly.
1:2:27|1:2:32|The soldier Xiao Jiang forcibly handed the item to [Tang Tianxiang], who could only smile coldly and put it into his mouth.
1:2:34|1:2:47|Seeing [Tang Tianxiang] like this, the soldier standing behind him took out two boxes of Japanese cigarettes wrapped in parchment paper from his coat pocket, and then forcibly stuffed the cigarettes into [Tang Tianxiang]'s arms.
1:2:47|1:2:54|In the next moment, [Tang Tianxiang] saw the soldier rubbing his two fingers lightly, seemingly trying to force a transaction of goods for money.
1:3:1|1:3:10|Oh, after [Xiao Jiang] handed it to Lao Guo, he gently knocked on the door.
1:3:34|1:3:45|The reason is that his current act of protecting the refugees in Nanjing has disrupted the friendly relationship between Germany and Japan.
1:4:34|1:4:46|[Mrs. Tang] sat by the window, unable to believe that Mr. Rabe had abandoned her husband who had worked for him for over a decade.
1:4:46|1:4:55|[Mrs. Tang] turned her head and looked at her young daughter, who was reciting the Three-Character Classic. Then she helplessly muttered, "What should we do next?"
1:5:10|1:5:16|[Tang Tianxiang] put down the family photo in his hand, stood up, picked up the suit jacket hanging on the wooden stake, and slowly put it on.
1:5:16|1:5:24|Mrs. Tang then opened the drawer, took out five silver dollars, and walked towards her husband.
1:5:27|1:5:34|Mrs. Tang adjusted her husband's coat with one hand and gently patted his shoulder.
1:5:34|1:5:44|And [Tang Tianxiang] then bowed his head and took off the ring from his right ring finger, placing it in the palm of [Mrs. Tang], and then firmly held it in front of him.
1:5:44|1:5:49|Feeling the dampness on his neck, [Tang Tianxiang] tightened his embrace and then decisively left the person in his arms.
1:5:50|1:5:57|The fierce wind, the swirling sand and dust, carrying burnt flags and a pungent stench, swept towards [Tang Tianxiang].
1:5:57|1:6:11|He paid no attention at all, but instead clasped his hands in front of his chest and walked straight through the once tranquil and sacred church. Then he arrived at the busiest street in the past, where, as far as the eye could see, there were often no tiles left, and everywhere was in ruins.
1:6:12|1:6:21|The streets were littered with bodies, and among them lay the aged wood that had been bombed and burned for days without turning to ashes.
1:6:22|1:6:27|At this moment, a clear but muffled sound reached Tang Tianxiang's ears.
1:6:27|1:6:31|He looked up and saw a squad of eight Japanese soldiers.
1:6:31|1:6:37|With a quick glance, he hurriedly bent his entire back and retreated to the side to show respect.
1:6:37|1:6:43|Fortunately, the team had no intention of causing trouble, and after passing by him, they walked towards the small path diagonally ahead.
1:6:43|1:6:49|Using the corner of his eye to illuminate the group of people who had disappeared, [Tang Tianxiang] straightened his back and returned to the main road, continuing to walk forward.
1:7:18|1:7:29|When the patrolling Japanese troops left, a man in a suit with a slicked-back hair led [Tang Tianxiang] inside.
1:7:42|1:7:50|As soon as the words fell, he noticed the newcomer, the man in a suit with a slicked-back hairstyle, Mr. [Kadokawa Masao], who was introducing Mr. Teng to him.
1:8:0|1:8:7|On the other side of the safe zone, after seeing off her husband, [Mrs. Tang] brought the whole family to the courtyard to bask in the sun.
1:8:7|1:8:16|Little Sister is singing the musical version of "The Pillars of the Bridge". Although she is only wearing tattered cotton padded jacket, with every move she makes, it seems as if one can see the water sleeves twirling in her hands.
1:8:17|1:8:27|Hearing the commotion over here, a group of children couldn't wait and rushed over. Unable to see clearly, they simply sat on the wooden stakes, extending their small hands, imitating the fighting moves.
1:8:27|1:8:36|Teacher Jiang also supported the recovered Xiao Jiang and slowly walked towards the bustling area.
1:8:48|1:9:8|Through layers of fences, the Japanese officer was also drawn over by the low singing.
1:9:8|1:9:12|The wealthy and dashing officer took off a seal from a paper with a portrait of Mr. [Tang Tianxiang].
1:9:16|1:9:22|Next, the officer handed the note to Mr. [Tang Tianxiang] while asking for his assistance.
1:9:22|1:9:34|Mr. Tang Tianxiang then took the paper with both hands and looked down at it carefully.
1:9:34|1:9:37|Then he pursed his chapped lips and repeated the word "friend".
1:9:42|1:9:50|Japanese officers and Mr. Kadokawa Masao crowded around him in the room, applauding to congratulate him.
1:9:50|1:9:54|The next moment, a group of armed squads regrouped and charged into the safe zone again.
1:9:56|1:10:4|Mrs. Tang grabbed Little Sister and then picked up her daughter Mao Mao, hurriedly running towards the dormitory.
1:10:4|1:10:11|A foreign doctor had just rushed into the corridor, warning not to resist, and the next second he was knocked down by a Japanese soldier who burst in.
1:10:13|1:10:20|The Chinese soldiers and nurses who were originally here to heal their wounds, seeing that they were powerless to resist, could only helplessly raise their hands.
1:10:20|1:10:25|The soldier, who was severely injured and blinded, sat leaning on the hospital bed and was tragically shot in the head.
1:10:25|1:10:31|The sudden panic caused the foreign woman to grab the children and run straight towards the attic.
1:10:36|1:10:40|And [Xiao Jiang] led a group of women into the dark space in the attic.
1:10:44|1:10:50|The foreign woman shouted that she was American, but the next second she was fiercely slapped by Japanese soldiers.
1:10:50|1:11:0|In the exhibition room downstairs, more than a dozen Chinese soldiers were forcibly pushed into the dispensary of the Siping Women's Building by Japanese soldiers, and then the door was closed and they were shot at.
1:11:0|1:11:8|At this moment, a young foreign woman rushed forward to stop the massacre, but the Japanese soldiers who had already gone mad paid no attention.
1:11:14|1:11:26|Teacher Jiang had just settled a group of women when, the next moment, she saw [Jiang Shuyun] leading a group of Japanese soldiers, stopping in front of a heavy wooden door. Pushing open the door, a beautifully patterned leopard specimen caught [Jiang Shuyun]'s eye.
1:11:35|1:11:40|With his hands behind his back, Tang Tianxiang took a moment to look down at his feet before strolling into the house.
1:11:40|1:11:49|On the exquisitely carved wooden stand, a majestic golden eagle is perched, calmly staring straight ahead, its sharp talons tightly gripping the top of the display pedestal.
1:11:49|1:11:55|Tang Tianxiang couldn't help but be attracted by the string of agate necklace on the table in front of him.
1:11:55|1:12:0|He slowly picked it up and aimed it at the sunlight coming in through the window, looking at it with a hint of admiration.
1:12:3|1:12:7|Kadokawa Masao then turned his head and asked Teacher Jiang if this belonged to him.
1:12:7|1:12:17|Teacher Jiang walked over slowly, nodded, and took the string of agate necklace.
1:12:27|1:12:30|Teacher Jiang looked at the smiling Kadokawa Masao and handed the things over.
1:12:35|1:12:40|Kadokawa Masao put away his smile, said thank you, and then turned and walked out of the room.
1:12:40|1:12:43|At this moment, the house of [Tang Tianxiang] was crowded with women and children.
1:13:11|1:13:16|Accepting the military officer charging towards the women behind him, [Tang Tianxiang] quickly pulled out the paper from his pocket.
1:13:33|1:13:43|However, the group of officers had long been impatient, pushing aside Tang Tianxiang, and accurately found Mrs. Tang and her sister Little Sister in the crowd.
1:13:43|1:13:50|[Mrs. Tang] witnessed, immediately placed [Little Sister] behind her, surrounded by hungry and aggressive military officers like wolves and tigers.
1:13:50|1:14:1|Seeing Little Sister about to be dragged away, Tang Tianxiang's daughter, Mao Mao, ran over and grabbed the leg of one of the men. The military officer who was struggling with Tang Tianxiang picked her up, opened the window on the attic, and threw her down.
1:14:4|1:14:10|When he came to his senses, [Tang Tianxiang] quickly pulled apart the tightly huddled group of people and leaned against the window.
1:14:10|1:14:17|Mrs. Tang then instantly fainted, letting go of Little Sister, and lay straight on the ground.
1:14:17|1:14:27|Little Sister was about to pinch Mrs. Tang's philtrum to wake her up as she was out of breath, but the next second she was dragged out by a military officer from behind.
1:14:27|1:14:33|[Tang Tianxiang] still clung to the window, unable to believe that his little daughter had just been brushed off in front of him.
1:14:34|1:14:44|And finally, he couldn't hold on any longer and slowly knelt down on the ground.
1:14:44|1:14:57|After the tragedy, Japanese officer Kadokawa Masao stood arrogantly in front of Mr. Lafei's desk, claiming that many women with curly hair and lipstick in the safety zone must all be prostitutes.
1:15:11|1:15:18|Mr. Tomita translated Jiang Shuyun's questioning to the Japanese officer, and Mr. Rabe sitting in the chair spoke up.
1:15:43|1:15:47|Earlier, the Japanese army successfully occupied Nanjing in just three days.
1:15:54|1:15:55|He then applied pressure.
1:16:24|1:16:34|Various situations were listed, and Mr. [Rabe], [Xiao Jiang], and other representatives of the safety zone staff who came to negotiate could only bow their heads helplessly.
1:16:34|1:16:45|Soon, under heavy pressure, the gate of the safe zone was completely opened, and all the women and children lined up in four rows and walked straight out, heading towards the church in the city.
1:16:45|1:17:16|The procession, which almost filled the street, quickly arrived at its destination. Mr. [Rabe] and [Xiao Jiang] were already standing in the center of the church, waiting for a long time. Looking at the young and old faces, Mr. [Rabe] took a deep breath and spoke with difficulty.
1:18:33|1:18:42|After Xiao Jiang conveyed the Japanese's demands to everyone, Mr. Rabe burst into tears, helplessly apologizing to everyone.
1:18:42|1:18:48|[Kadokawa Masao] stood in the corridor above the church, listening to the Japanese officer beside him speaking condescendingly.
1:18:59|1:19:9|Xiao Jiang, with a blank expression on her face, raised her hand.
1:19:9|1:19:16|Under the astonished gazes of everyone, [Xiao Jiang] raised his hand above his head and slowly made his way through the crowd to the center of the church.
1:19:20|1:19:27|Her slightly curled hair covered her profile, but inadvertently, a tear rolled down from the corner of her eye.
1:19:27|1:19:38|[Jiang Shuyun] standing on the stage stared at her, and finally couldn't help but cry out.
1:19:38|1:19:47|At this moment, another young woman in the crowd raised her hand. Her hair, already cut into a messy and shapeless style, also shed tears as she crossed the crowd and stood in the center of the church.
1:19:51|1:20:7|Xiao Jiang turned her head and extended her right hand, painted with nail polish, firmly grasping her hand.
1:20:14|1:20:16|A girl in student attire stood next to [Xiao Jiang].
1:20:25|1:20:34|The sound of the drums, like an invisible force, prompted one woman after another in the crowd to raise their hands.
1:20:34|1:20:38|Some people still have wounds that have not healed due to fleeing the famine.
1:20:38|1:20:46|Some people seem to have been doing housework for a long time, with bulging veins on the back of their hands. Although not as moist as a young girl, it exudes a sense of tranquility everywhere.
1:20:46|1:20:51|The only thing in common is the determination to sacrifice oneself to protect the elderly and weak from harm.
1:20:52|1:20:53|Before long, [Tang Tianxiang], [Kadokawa Masao], [Jiang Shuyun], Mrs. Tang, [Xiao Jiang], [Little Sister], [Shun Zi], and [Baihe Zi] arrived.
1:21:6|1:21:9|Lujian Xiong didn't respond, just looked away.
1:21:9|1:21:12|Teacher Jiang wept bitterly as she watched Xiao Jiang and others leave.
1:21:13|1:21:21|Under the ruins in the square, a group of Japanese soldiers and officers are gathered in front of the 100 unsettled people.
1:21:36|1:21:42|Japanese women charge 5 yuan per time, while Chinese and Korean women charge 2 yuan per time, with only 15 minutes per person.
1:21:43|1:21:49|After two kicks, [Little Sister] was casually folded and laid out on the straw mat.
1:21:56|1:22:1|The shameless [Little Sister], without any hesitation, sat up abruptly and grabbed a handful of rice to stuff into her mouth.
1:22:3|1:22:10|Just as he took a few bites, a big hand grabbed his chin and pushed him violently to the ground, pressing down on him.
1:22:10|1:22:16|Watching as [Little Sister] rejected his kiss, Japanese officer raised his hand and slapped her tender cheek.
1:22:19|1:22:27|On the other side, Kadokawa Masao was surprised to see why Baihe Zi was here, but the woman next to the straw mat raised her head, it turned out to be Xiao Jiang.
1:22:39|1:22:46|[Kadokawa Masao] did not show any anger at this, just sat slowly on the stool beside the grass mat, quietly watching [Xiao Jiang] lying back on the grass mat.
1:22:47|1:22:52|At this moment, [Kadokawa Masao] walked over with a coat on, a big smile on his face.
1:22:52|1:22:58|Seeing [Kadokawa Masao] sitting there in a daze, he asked if [Kadokawa Masao] was finished.
1:23:6|1:23:9|And [Kadokawa Masao] sat there as if he had lost his soul, in a daze.
1:23:15|1:23:27|Next door, the Japanese soldier from the invading army, Kadokawa Masao, was shouting in dissatisfaction, saying that his friend's voice was too loud. Meanwhile, Xiao Jiang shifted his gaze away during this confrontation.
1:23:27|1:23:32|[Kadokawa Masao] had just regained consciousness when he was overwhelmed by this intense gaze, and quickly got up and left.
1:23:32|1:23:40|Just a few steps out, unable to resist, [Xiao Jiang] turned back, the dream bell that had been hanging on his ankle continuously making noise.
1:23:42|1:23:49|On the other side, Mr. Tomita hurriedly walked in from outside the main gate of the temporary Japanese command post.
1:23:49|1:23:54|Over there, just as he had finished pushing away the food delivery documents, a friendly Japanese soldier came running over to greet him.
1:24:6|1:24:10|Finally, Mr. Tomita met Mr. Rabe and Mr. Tang.
1:24:17|1:24:18|Then he added.
1:24:18|1:24:24|Tang Tianxiang's youngest daughter was murdered last night.
1:24:35|1:24:43|Beside an old piano, Japanese officer Kadokawa Masao and a group of Japanese soldiers were happily singing around the soldier playing the piano, Huang Changli.
1:25:5|1:25:11|At this moment, a flatbed truck slowly passes through the crowd, heading towards the incinerator not far away.
1:25:11|1:25:18|For some reason, unable to control himself, he involuntarily chased after the cart through the crowd.
1:25:18|1:25:24|When the cart stopped in front of the incinerator, a soldier lifted the straw mat, and a pair of arms weakly dropped down.
1:25:26|1:25:34|Then, a series of crisp sounds entered Kadokawa Masao's ears, as bells tied to the ankles of the woman rang.
1:25:34|1:25:44|The porters didn't care about this at all. In a few moves, they dragged the person's limbs with their partners, and threw them onto the table next to them.
1:25:44|1:25:49|Finally, Kadokawa Masao saw the face of the person inside, who turned out to be Xiao Jiang, previously mistaken for Baihe Zi.
1:25:51|1:26:2|Xiao Jiang's blood at the corner of his mouth had not yet coagulated, his eyes had not even had time to close, and he was lying naked with no dignity, stacked on the side.
1:26:2|1:26:4|The character stood still for a while, then quickly turned and left.
1:26:16|1:26:22|Outside the church, [Little Sister] casually wrapped in a coat, singing that familiar musical.
1:26:22|1:26:32|[Kadokawa Masao] wanted to speak up to stop it, but seeing the Japanese officer standing behind [Little Sister], he remained silent.
1:26:32|1:26:37|The Japanese officer finally lost his patience, grabbed Little Sister and dragged her behind the curtain outside the church in the city.
1:26:43|1:26:48|Xiao Jiang wanted to step forward to stop, but was grabbed by the arm by the Japanese soldier behind him.
1:26:48|1:26:52|A Japanese officer then walked down the steps.
1:27:1|1:27:2|And then he said.
1:27:5|1:27:18|Kadokawa Masao, who was originally full of anxiety, stopped in his tracks when he heard this, and watched as the expressionless Japanese officer walked away. Then he turned his head and looked at the group of women beside him, who were already half-naked.
1:27:18|1:27:24|Under the suppression of five or six Japanese soldiers, they followed behind the Japanese officer with fists and crutches.
1:27:24|1:27:28|Ahead, this is the road that Mr. [Tang Tianxiang] walked on when he sought help from the Japanese earlier.
1:27:40|1:27:56|The desire to return to Japan stirred the anger of the Japanese officer, who then delivered a heavy blow to his face. The soldier took the beating but dared not speak out, only able to return to the ranks, carrying his long spear obediently, guarding this group of women.
1:27:56|1:28:15|On the ground, the bodies of men and women that were piled up with red flags earlier have now been cleaned up thoroughly. Wave after wave of women who were sent to be comfort women walked from dusk to night, finally returning to the gate of the safe zone amidst a raging fire.
1:28:15|1:28:23|Teacher [Xiao Jiang], Mrs. Tang and other women and children were all leaning against the iron gate, looking towards the Yuchuan River, praying for the safe return of their loved ones.
1:28:23|1:28:26|There is no Little Sister among the faces.
1:28:35|1:28:46|Surrounded by many elderly women, they carefully held their own children, whose faces had long since changed beyond recognition, afraid that even the slightest force would hurt them.
1:28:46|1:28:53|And Mrs. Tang, unable to find Little Sister among the faces, simply buried her head in Mr. Tang's arms.
1:28:53|1:28:58|Wearing straw sandals, [Tang Tianxiang] just glanced at the Japanese officer before turning his head and walking back the way he came.
1:29:1|1:29:12|On February 22, 1938, Chairman Rabe of the Safety Zone Committee sent Tang Tianxiang to leave Nanjing for Shanghai.
1:29:12|1:29:18|Accompanying him were Mr. Tang's family and a Chinese military officer disguised as a servant.
1:29:18|1:29:25|Seeing Mr. Rabe walking into the courtyard with his luggage, all the women and children in the safety zone raised their hands high, begging him to stay.
1:29:27|1:29:35|Several German men who came to pick up blocked the crowded crowd and managed to bring Mr. Rabe out of the safety zone.
1:29:44|1:29:54|Hastily taking the luggage from above, [Tang Tianxiang], [Mrs. Tang], and the Chinese officer disguised as a servant squeezed through the gate of the safe zone.
1:29:56|1:30:7|Before getting on the car, Mr. Rabe couldn't resist turning back to look at the eager eyes. He simply knelt down on both knees and bowed deeply.
1:30:7|1:30:16|Thus, a door completely separated two worlds, as the person outside with luggage got into a sedan and finally left this earthly realm.
1:30:16|1:30:22|And as the car gradually disappeared, leaving behind a trail of deception, the hope in the eyes of the people inside the gate also shattered little by little.
1:30:23|1:30:29|The hands clinging to the iron gate refused to let go.
1:30:29|1:30:33|In the departing car, [Tang Tianxiang] embraced [Mrs. Tang], lying against the back seat.
1:30:33|1:30:40|Passing a bumpy road, [Tang Tianxiang] instinctively placed his left hand on [Mrs. Tang]'s abdomen.
1:30:40|1:30:46|Mrs. Tang, who was originally unable to lean on her husband, gently supported his hand.
1:30:46|1:30:52|[Tang Tianxiang] rubbed his chin against [Mrs. Tang]'s forehead, then held her tightly in his arms.
1:30:53|1:31:2|The road, just after the rain, was muddy with broken beams piled on the side of the road. In the distance, the roofs were still burning with unextinguished flames of war.
1:31:2|1:31:8|Two cars, each with luggage tied to the roof with hemp ropes, slowly drive through the street, one in front of the other.
1:31:8|1:31:14|Before long, the vehicles drove from the alleys of Nanjing City onto the main road.
1:31:14|1:31:18|In front of the gate, a group of heavily armed Japanese soldiers raised their hands to stop the car.
1:31:28|1:31:34|Soon after, a Japanese soldier shouted and unloaded all the luggage from the car.
1:31:34|1:31:38|Mr. Ita once again spoke up, saying that Japanese soldiers would help carry the luggage.
1:31:39|1:31:47|After Mr. Rabe showed his identification to the Japanese officer, he asked if his two assistants could also be taken away.
1:31:47|1:31:53|Mr. Ita said he would do his best, then took Mr. Rabe's hand and led him over the fence first.
1:31:53|1:32:2|At this moment, a Japanese officer lay in front of a lean man, first looking down at his identification, then standing in front of Mr. and Mrs. Tang.
1:32:7|1:32:14|The Japanese officer first greeted Mr. Tang by saying, "Long time no see," and then took his identification as usual to check.
1:32:20|1:32:25|Then he hugged Mr. Tang's shoulders as if cutting his face, leading him towards the fence.
1:32:30|1:32:32|A Japanese officer walks and talks.
1:32:39|1:32:44|Then he released his arms, allowing the couple [Tang Tianxiang] to pass through Jingrong, the two of them passing by the wooden fence.
1:32:46|1:32:53|After passing through the narrow fence, the two hurried forward, but as they walked, they still turned their heads back.
1:32:53|1:32:59|Behind them, the Chinese military officer disguised as a servant is surrounded by a group of Japanese soldiers.
1:32:59|1:33:5|The Japanese officer approached with a big laugh, put his arm around him, and waved to the father and son.
1:33:6|1:33:11|The two of them quickly turned around and helped each other walk towards the gate of the city.
1:33:11|1:33:29|Approaching the second fence, Tang Tianxiang suddenly stopped in his tracks, placed the suitcase he was carrying by his feet, turned slowly to face Mrs. Tang, and handed her two passports.
1:33:40|1:33:49|[Tang Tianxiang] paused, raised his left hand, forcefully pulled Mrs. Tang's hand down, then lowered his head, staring intensely at his lower abdomen.
1:33:49|1:33:55|[Mrs. Tang] couldn't help but shed tears at this moment, watching [Tang Tianxiang] gently place his right hand on his own belly.
1:33:59|1:34:8|Next, [Tang Tianxiang] resolutely turned around and walked back step by step in the direction he came from.
1:34:8|1:34:15|The sound of Mrs. Tang's crying can be heard, Tang Tianxiang couldn't help but stand still, turning his head slightly in place.
1:34:15|1:34:22|[Mrs. Tang] covered her abdomen, slightly arched her waist, gasping continuously, with watery eyes, but failed to get the company of [Tang Tianxiang].
1:34:30|1:34:39|Watching as [Tang Tianxiang] smiled and turned away again, Mr. [Kadokawa] hurriedly caught up to [Tang Tianxiang], but the next moment he heard the inquiry from the Japanese officer.
1:34:47|1:34:51|[Tang Tianxiang] pursed his lips, then nodded slightly behind the Japanese officer.
1:35:0|1:35:13|After listening to Mr. [Ita]'s translation, the Japanese officer released his grip on [Tang Tianxiang]'s arm, stared at [Tang Tianxiang] for a moment, then turned his head and walked straight towards the Chinese officer dressed as a servant.
1:35:13|1:35:24|With a strong push, the Chinese officer staggered, and [Mrs. Tang] watched as the Chinese officer approached, unable to resist taking a step towards him, as if this could bring her closer to [Tang Tianxiang].
1:35:26|1:35:35|When passing by the Chinese officer, he couldn't control himself and turned his toes, walking straight towards [Tang Tianxiang].
1:35:35|1:35:45|Mr. [Rabe] stood outside the wooden fence, watching as the Chinese officer approached, reaching out to pat his shoulder.
1:35:45|1:35:49|[Tang Tianxiang] stood outside the wooden fence, smiling.
1:35:59|1:36:6|As soon as the words fell, Mrs. Tang grabbed the iron wire on the wooden fence without any regard for the thorns piercing her skin.
1:36:6|1:36:13|Mr. Rabe in the distance looked over with the Chinese officer towards this side.
1:36:18|1:36:24|[Mrs. Tang] tried her best to remain calm and not let out loud sobs.
1:36:25|1:36:34|The uncontrollable trembling, still transmitted through the wire, clearly vibrated Mr. Tang's eardrums.
1:36:34|1:36:43|Mr. Tang reached out his hand, firmly grasping Mrs. Tang's fingertips while gradually letting go, then turned to Mr. Fu and asked for his help.
1:36:43|1:36:52|Watching Mr. Fu Tian slowly moving away from [Mrs. Tang] with his support, Mr. Tang weakly lowered his arm, resting it on the wire mesh, propping himself up feebly.
1:36:54|1:37:1|The originally lowered brows and drooping corners of the mouth, upon seeing Mrs. Tang turn back again, forced a smile to curve up.
1:37:1|1:37:6|Then he waved his hand vigorously again, signaling [Mrs. Tang] to leave with peace of mind.
1:37:6|1:37:14|Finally, [Mrs. Tang] turned around with difficulty, supported by Mr. Fu Tian, bent over, and took small steps towards Mr. Rabe.
1:37:24|1:37:32|On the back of a low mountain, a sandy area devoid of grass had three tree stumps driven into it, each nearly two meters tall.
1:37:32|1:37:42|A team of six people stood in formation, listening to orders, raising their guns, and shooting at the person blindfolded under the tree stump.
1:37:42|1:37:48|At this moment, [Tang Tianxiang] was tied up with his hands behind his back and brought to this makeshift execution ground.
1:37:56|1:37:58|Looking around at the surroundings, [Tang Tianxiang] exclaimed in admiration.
1:38:1|1:38:5|Then he took a step forward and took off Tang Tianxiang's glasses.
1:38:5|1:38:13|The Japanese soldier tried to blindfold him, but [Tang Tianxiang] took the opportunity to remove it and refused to put it back on.
1:38:13|1:38:19|The Japanese officer waved his hand and then put the glasses back on Tang Tianxiang's ears.
1:38:19|1:38:25|Perhaps it was Tang Tianxiang's forceful gesture of flicking his bangs that angered him, as he snatched the cigarette away and stomped it fiercely on the ground.
1:38:51|1:38:55|Before long, [Tang Tianxiang] was pressed against the tree stump in the middle.
1:38:55|1:39:2|Several Japanese soldiers first untied the hemp rope that had been carelessly bound around [Tang Tianxiang] earlier, and then casually threw him into the nearby bushes.
1:39:2|1:39:10|Finally, [Tang Tianxiang] was forced against the tree stump, and the hemp rope was picked up and continuously wound around his body.
1:39:10|1:39:17|The Japanese officer stood not far away, directly facing [Tang Tianxiang], watching as the hemp rope passed through his chest and abdomen, then through his knees.
1:39:20|1:39:28|The order to aim could be heard, but he instinctively turned his back.
1:39:28|1:39:36|With six shots fired simultaneously, [Tang Tianxiang] met his end, not knowing which bullet precisely severed the rope around his chest and abdomen.
1:39:36|1:39:38|Due to gravity, [Tang Tianxiang] fell towards...
1:39:40|1:39:47|The upper body swayed slightly in the air.
1:39:47|1:39:57|The commander, unable to bear the sight, raised his pistol and shot him in the head, then ordered the team to put away their rifles and run out of the execution ground.
1:39:57|1:40:3|Finally, there were only bodies lying on the ground after the execution and a Japanese officer standing with his back turned in the distance.
1:40:9|1:40:22|A gust of wind carrying sand and stones swept by, the Japanese officer couldn't help but look back, watching Tang Tianxiang's body still hanging in the air, hands in pockets, lifting his foot and walking towards him.
1:40:22|1:40:26|He eventually chose to stand still not far away, looking at him steadily.
1:41:21|1:41:31|In the city of Nanjing, all the people followed orders and were gradually divided into two groups, one consisting of women and children, and the other of all males.
1:41:31|1:41:38|Shun Zi is now holding a little boy in her arms, standing in a line with two others. She raises one hand above her head, holding up a bamboo pole to measure their heights.
1:41:40|1:41:52|Outside the team, a Japanese officer stopped a young man, first touched his cotton hat, then touched his eyebrows, and ordered his subordinates to take him to the other side.
1:41:52|1:41:56|Shun Zi and the little boy, who passed the bamboo pole test, arrived at the registration office separately.
1:41:56|1:42:0|The soldier in front of the little boy took a glance at him and then sent him away.
1:42:0|1:42:6|The soldier in front of [Shun Zi] patted his whole body, didn't find anything unusual, and then sent him to the registration office behind.
1:42:9|1:42:16|Soldiers at the registration office are issuing certificates of good citizens with stamps to the people who have passed the inspection.
1:42:16|1:42:25|The boy who was dismissed without needing a good citizen certificate turned his head and saw the paper in [Shun Zi]'s hand, then quickly turned around and lowered his head.
1:42:25|1:42:32|The next moment, a Japanese officer snatched the proof from [Shun Zi]'s hand, tore it into two pieces, and threw it on the ground before dragging her away.
1:42:35|1:42:40|Two Japanese soldiers were called over casually, and then [Shun Zi] was handed over to them.
1:42:40|1:42:51|In a hurry, [Shun Zi] discovered a teacher Jiang outside of Massachusetts.
1:43:1|1:43:13|The sudden riot caused the Japanese soldiers to have to fire warning shots, but one of them missed, and a woman from Teacher Jiang's group came out and ran straight towards her husband who was being pulled onto the truck.
1:43:13|1:43:19|In the chaos, [Kadokawa Masao] arrived outside the group of villagers.
1:43:19|1:43:26|A foreign woman in the surging crowd was shouting at the top of her lungs, demanding to speak with [Kadokawa Masao]'s superior.
1:43:26|1:43:29|A foreign man working in the safe zone provides support.
1:43:29|1:43:36|Just saying a few words, [Kadokawa Masao] looked around and then impulsively spoke to the Japanese soldiers maintaining order.
1:43:40|1:43:43|Went to see [Kadokawa Masao]'s superior together, but still got dragged back.
1:43:57|1:44:10|It's [Jiang Shuyun], closely following behind, listening to her foreign male colleague saying that the Japanese would definitely not release anyone, clenching her fists tightly and declaring that she's not afraid of the Japanese military.
1:44:10|1:44:23|Finally, [Jiang Shuyun] was brought before the Japanese officer. She took a deep breath and loudly expressed her hope that the Japanese officer would listen to the pleas of these women for their husbands and sons, as they were all ordinary civilians.
1:44:24|1:44:30|Besides, his colleagues are also on that truck, but they are not soldiers.
1:44:30|1:44:36|Every now and then, Kadokawa Masao brought Jiang Shuyun and another person back to Teacher Jiang's side.
1:44:36|1:44:45|After Kadokawa Masao dismissed two soldiers, Jiang Shuyun told Teacher Jiang some good news.
1:45:23|1:45:29|But [Kadokawa Masao] just stood outside the crowd, bowing his head and looking at the dark mass in front of him.
1:45:29|1:45:33|Teacher [Xiao Jiang] is now walking against the crowd, moving the scarf onto her head as she walks.
1:45:49|1:45:56|The Japanese soldier, upon hearing that the teacher with glasses, Chen, is the husband of [Xiao Jiang], simply pushes him onto the truck.
1:45:56|1:46:1|Next, Xiao Jiang leaned on his shoulder, squeezed in the crowd, lowered his body and hurriedly left.
1:46:16|1:46:24|A middle-aged woman first took her son off the truck, then rushed to the other truck where her husband was.
1:46:29|1:46:34|He then realized that the people in front of him couldn't understand Japanese, so he raised one finger towards the woman.
1:46:36|1:46:39|So, the mother and son were driven back to the group of common people.
1:47:4|1:47:11|Shun Zi, who was detained in the truck area, saw the little boy looking around in the crowd, who was Xiao Dou.
1:47:11|1:47:16|Soon after, Xiaodou quickly pushed through the crowded people and squeezed straight towards the truck where [Shun Zi] was.
1:47:16|1:47:22|The next moment, he was pulled away by a Japanese officer with a scar on his face.
1:47:22|1:47:26|Reluctantly, [Xiao Dou] had no choice but to follow behind [Xiao Jiang], who was leading another man away.
1:47:28|1:47:37|Although [Xiao Jiang] changed the scarf to a cotton hat covering his head, at this moment, a Japanese soldier with a goatee seemed to have noticed something unusual.
1:47:37|1:47:43|Although Kadokawa Masao saw it, he just took a glance and didn't make any move.
1:47:43|1:47:50|The soldier with a goatee approached the Japanese officer and informed him of what he had seen.
1:47:50|1:47:55|Hearing Shun Zi's cries for help, Kadokawa Masao stood outside the crowd, closely watching Xiao Jiang's movements.
1:48:7|1:48:15|Xiao Jiang and Xiao Dou just managed to pull Shun Zi off the truck in the chaos, and the next second, gunshots rang out throughout the city.
1:48:15|1:48:23|Next, Shun Zi and Little Sister were pressed directly into the mud, while Xiao Jiang was taken away by three or four Japanese soldiers and brought in front of a Japanese officer.
1:48:37|1:48:39|He then spoke coldly.
1:48:44|1:48:48|Next, the Japanese officer turned his head and ordered his subordinates to take away [Xiao Jiang].
1:48:48|1:48:50|As they passed by Kadokawa Masao, Xiao Jiang spoke up.
1:48:52|1:48:58|Under the intense gaze of [Jiang Shuyun], [Kadokawa Masao] clearly heard that he was going to make him shoot at himself.
1:48:58|1:49:4|Even as he walked away, those eyes remained tightly locked on him.
1:49:4|1:49:12|Until [Jiang Shuyun] was pressed by four Japanese soldiers to walk towards the church with her lower back, her gaze was forcibly interrupted.
1:49:12|1:49:20|Continuing on, [Jiang Shuyun] and the group stepped on the muddy ground, passing by a group of Japanese soldiers holding long spears standing at the bottom of the church steps.
1:49:22|1:49:32|Then he stepped up the church steps one by one, with the excited soldiers about to push him into the church.
1:49:32|1:49:39|A puff of smoke rose from the back of [Jiang Shuyun]'s head, and then he collapsed on the ground like a pile of mud.
1:49:39|1:49:46|Behind him, [Kadokawa Masao] slowly lowered his raised arm and holstered the smoking handgun at his waist.
1:49:46|1:49:49|The soldier from Lake Bazihu quickly caught up with Kadokawa Masao and the others.
1:49:54|1:50:1|Ignoring the astonishment of the people behind him, [Kadokawa Masao] lifted his foot and slowly walked towards [Jiang Shuyun].
1:50:1|1:50:12|The soldiers who were originally escorting [Jiang Shuyun] also jumped away at the sound of the gun, and when they looked up, they saw [Kadokawa Masao] approaching, and could only cautiously step back in a daze.
1:50:12|1:50:24|At this moment, about two meters away from [Jiang Shuyun], [Kadokawa Masao] stopped his steps, lowered his head to look at [Jiang Shuyun] lying on the ground, his right hand holding the gun unconsciously shaking slightly, and stood silently for a long time.
1:50:31|1:50:44|Days passed by, [Jiang] rode her bicycle against the cold wind and arrived at the Imperial Army rest area.
1:50:44|1:50:55|Upon learning that Baihe Zi had died of illness on the front line, Jiang stood still, watching as Mrs. Tang slowly took down Baihe Zi's name tag from the door, and then handed a cloth bag to Mrs. Tang.
1:51:27|1:51:30|Then [Tang Tianxiang] pushed his bicycle and left the Imperial Army rest area desolately.
1:51:32|1:51:36|The gentle breeze and sunny weather set the stage for a rare dance performance in the city of Nanjing.
1:51:36|1:51:45|On both sides of the road, the destroyed and collapsed electric poles were forcibly propped up, with Japanese flags hanging at the top, being whipped by the cold wind, hitting the scattered wires.
1:51:45|1:51:52|In the largest square in the city center, Japanese soldiers are wiping several drum-shaped cowhide drums.
1:51:56|1:51:59|Japanese soldiers in the distance with cloth strips tied around their foreheads are being illuminated.
1:52:0|1:52:8|On both sides of the road, groups of three or four Japanese soldiers sat in a circle, each holding the ashes of their brothers and friends in their hands.
1:52:8|1:52:21|In front of the line, former military officers who once held important positions in the army have simple spirit tablets, wooden boards standing upright on the coarse ground.
1:52:21|1:52:35|After the soldiers standing in front of the taiko drum were ready, a military officer in a kimono ordered everyone to stand up. The soldiers in the row instantly hung the urns neatly on their chests and stood solemnly.
1:52:35|1:52:44|On the other side of the square, the Japanese soldiers were divided into two groups. After the division, each leading soldier raised the flag with their unit number high.
1:52:44|1:52:51|In front of the formation, a group of soldiers wearing Japanese flags on their heads carried a wooden board about ten meters long and six meters wide on their shoulders.
1:52:52|1:53:10|On the wooden board, two soldiers stood facing each other. Upon the command of the officer in a kimono, they raised their hands and struck the central cowhide drum with great force.
1:53:10|1:53:17|The drum beats resounded, gradually becoming powerful with the rhythm, like a whirlwind and a thunderstorm rolling in.
1:53:17|1:53:33|In this rare warm winter sun, a sense of solemn killing intent permeates the air. The soldiers surrounding the wooden boards stare ahead tightly, but unlike others, [Kadokawa Masao]'s gaze seems detached even though he is standing in the line.
1:53:33|1:53:41|The drumming came to a temporary halt, and everyone, as if rehearsed, raised their left hand to the edge of their eyelids, with their right arm against their ears, aiming straight for the sky.
1:53:46|1:53:56|At this moment, the thunderous drums resounded on the wooden board again. Following the heavy beats, everyone lightly tapped their right arms in the air, and then shouted with all their might.
1:53:56|1:54:3|Next, the formation where [Kadokawa Masao] was located stopped and began to walk towards the direction of the Japanese officers on the other side of the square.
1:54:3|1:54:13|In front of the oxhide drum, [Kadokawa Masao] and others were no longer standing upright, but eerily straightened their upper bodies while bending their waists.
1:54:13|1:54:18|Moving forward, it is the right hand with the right foot, and the left hand with the left foot, alternately reaching forward.
1:54:20|1:54:32|Repeating the 24-beat rhythm, clenching both fists and thrusting towards the right knee, then opening and closing both arms forcefully, striking once with a sound, and then switching back to the left knee.
1:54:32|1:54:40|After completing this action on both sides, he returned to his waist and continued to walk forward with the same hand and foot.
1:54:44|1:54:56|In the almost bombed-out main street, due to the rush of this occupation ceremony, only had time to hastily clean up, the roadsides were piled with half a foot high rubble and tiles.
1:54:56|1:55:6|But this broken scene still couldn't stop the almost fanatical emotions of the team. In no time, the whole team arrived at the front of the city gate cave along the main street.
1:55:6|1:55:9|And at this moment, the positions of everyone's hands also changed.
1:55:10|1:55:21|The soldiers, who had been advancing with their fingertips, now stepped to the beat. After four heavy beats, they raised their fingertips to chin level, forming a five-mouth shape.
1:55:21|1:55:24|With this posture, the palms of the hands alternately push forward.
1:55:26|1:55:37|After repeating the four heavy beats, push the left palm forward, bend the hand, stab towards the left knee, the right palm hangs in front of the body like drawing a tiger, maintaining a half-fist distance with the left palm.
1:55:37|1:55:47|Then both palms facing upwards, extending forcefully from in front of the knees, one on the left and one on the right, reaching shoulder level, and repeating the stabbing motion towards the left knee.
1:55:47|1:55:54|While [Shun Zi] and the group were imprisoned behind the wooden fence in front of the city gate cave, they were forced to watch the grand ceremony of the Japanese army celebrating the occupation of Nanjing.
1:55:57|1:56:2|Finally, with a melodious shout, the group stopped not far from the city gate tunnel.
1:56:2|1:56:7|Under the rare winter sun, Kadokawa Masao lost himself in the sunlight.
1:56:8|1:56:14|He who was originally standing by the handrail, seemed to be back to the time of rehearsing for this celebration.
1:56:14|1:56:25|Above the wooden platform, soldiers took off their shirts and vigorously beat the oxhide drum, while below, [Kadokawa Masao] and dozens of others formed a circle, carrying the wooden platform on their shoulders and moving forward quickly.
1:56:25|1:56:34|Unlike the excitement of others, [Kadokawa Masao] stared fixedly at the soldiers drumming above, his eyes gradually losing their spirit.
1:56:34|1:56:43|The soldiers crowded behind [Kadokawa Masao] were unusually emotional, carrying the wooden platform while shouting loudly in [Kadokawa Masao]'s ear.
1:56:43|1:56:48|And [Kadokawa Masao] also gradually loosened his grip amidst the furious roar.
1:56:48|1:56:56|The whole person weakly leaned the upper body on the shoulder of the person behind.
1:56:56|1:56:59|Finally, he couldn't help but vent his emotions.
1:56:59|1:57:6|Standing in front of the square under the scorching sun, [Kadokawa Masao] once again recalled his exhausted self and slowly closed his eyes.
1:57:10|1:57:16|On the busy small road outside the river, strands of sunlight pierced through the flying dust, shining beside [Kadokawa Masao].
1:57:16|1:57:27|The early birds chirped in the sky, a gentle breeze brushed by, and dandelions scattered in the grass on both sides of the path, filling the sky.
1:57:27|1:57:34|On the path, [Shun Zi] and [Xiao Dou] walked slowly with their hands behind their backs.
1:57:42|1:57:52|The soldier took out a short knife from behind and quickly walked up to [Shun Zi], lifted her wrist, and then used the knife to cut the hemp rope.
1:57:52|1:57:57|After seeing Little Sister's restraints being removed, Kadokawa Masao stood with his hands behind his back, lightly lifted his chin, and let the two of them leave.
1:57:59|1:58:5|Seeing no response from the two figures with their backs to him and shoes on the wrong feet, the soldier had to step forward and give them a gentle push.
1:58:5|1:58:13|Shun Zi, who took two steps forward with a bright expression, turned back in confusion, only to see the soldier waving his hand, urging the two to leave.
1:58:13|1:58:22|Shun Zi incredulously widened her eyes, then carefully turned around, taking small steps to closely follow Xiao Dou as they hurried forward.
1:58:22|1:58:27|Then he quickly lifted the hemp rope in his hand, wrapped it around [Xiao Dou]'s shoulders, and gradually accelerated step by step.
1:58:34|1:58:43|Watching the two flustered figures, [Kadokawa Masao] stood still in place, whether muttering to himself or asking the soldier, only to hear him say.
1:58:45|1:58:52|Then he slowly adjusted his body, raised his eyes to look at the soldier beside him, and then raised his right hand to salute him.
1:58:52|1:58:58|The soldier, already very flustered, saw [Kadokawa Masao] behaving like this, and suddenly bent down deeply to bow.
1:59:0|1:59:4|At a glance, he saw a face with suppressed and painful expression on the feet.
1:59:4|1:59:14|The soldier tightened his dry throat, unable to say a word, as if something was shaking and pressing on his chest. He took a deep breath but couldn't find an outlet.
1:59:14|1:59:20|He then took a deep look at his shoes, tightened the strap of the gun on his shoulder, and turned his head to walk towards the stone path.
1:59:30|1:59:33|The bustling outskirts road echoed with Kadokawa Masao's Yunzi.
1:59:33|1:59:40|The soldier who was roaring turned around and looked at [Kadokawa Masao], bowing deeply to him.
1:59:40|1:59:45|When he looked up again, a childlike smile bloomed on his face.
1:59:45|1:59:51|Facing the glaring sunlight, Tang Tianxiang smiled deeply, then walked back along the same path with light steps.
1:59:53|1:59:58|Kadokawa Masao lightly tugged at the corner of his mouth and quietly watched as the soldier walked away.
1:59:58|2:0:3|Then he turned around and followed towards [Shun Zi] and [Xiao Jiang].
2:0:3|2:0:7|The next moment, he squatted down in front of a patch of weeds.
2:0:7|2:0:13|Staring at the dandelions fluttering freely in the weed pile, [Kadokawa Masao] suddenly lost control of his emotions.
2:0:13|2:0:18|Large tears rolled down from the corners of his eyes, and his pointed head also shook violently.
2:0:20|2:0:23|He had to raise his left hand and firmly grab the military cap on top of his head.
2:0:23|2:0:27|After a brief pause, he suddenly closed his eyes tightly with force.
2:0:27|2:0:44|At this moment, [Kadokawa Masao] resolutely raised his right hand, aimed the pistol at his own temple, gently pulled the trigger, and then rolled down the grassy slope covered with dandelions.
2:0:44|2:0:48|Facing the warm sun, she ended her young life.
2:0:49|2:0:58|Hearing the sound, the soldier who had already walked far couldn't help but turn back, but he just stood there, looking into the distance.
2:0:58|2:1:6|On the other side, [Shun Zi] and Xiao Dou froze in place at the sound of the gun, but quickly realized they were unharmed and hurriedly checked their bodies.
2:1:7|2:1:26|Following that, both of them couldn't help but look towards the source of the noise inside, realizing that the footsteps had indeed ended their own lives. [Shun Zi] once again hugged Xiao Dou's shoulders, the previous incredulity instantly filled with a smile.
2:1:26|2:1:31|As they walked, Xiaodou finally relaxed, looked up at [Shun Zi], and smiled brightly.
2:1:32|2:1:47|After a while, [Shun Zi] finally had the leisure to look around and found only a few plump dandelions next to Xiao Dou. She bent down, picked one, and stuffed it into Xiao Dou's hand, looking satisfied.
2:1:47|2:1:56|Xiao Dou held them up in front of her, blew hard, and countless small umbrellas floated into the air towards the sun, disappearing in and out of sight, high and low.
2:1:56|2:2:0|Blowing away the past, the roots in hand also became the curious object of the small beans.
2:2:1|2:2:10|The once plump and self-sufficient dandelion now only has a long stem left. If you sniff carefully, you can still catch a faint fragrance.
2:2:21|2:2:28|And by the small river in the outskirts, Japanese officer Kadokawa Masao was sitting in a soy sauce vat, scrubbing himself under the warm sun.
2:2:28|2:2:41|It can be seen that he actually started to try to hold his breath in the water, not moving at all, with the sound of his heart pounding in his ears, but in the end he still leaped out of the water.
2:2:41|2:2:49|The soldier who was stunned by the gunshot and looked at [Kadokawa Masao] blending into the weeds, turned back and set foot on the way back.
2:2:55|2:3:1|Dandelion seeds are dancing in the wind, drifting towards an unknown destination, ready to take root and grow.
2:3:1|2:3:8|Xiao Jiang joyfully followed behind, looking at the free new lives unfolding, with a wrinkled smile on his face.
2:3:8|2:3:17|Despite the tears and gloom hidden behind the smile, he is still smiling.
