0:2:29|0:2:34|[Li Xing] finished speaking and smirked at her, causing the girl to burst into laughter.
0:2:34|0:2:43|There was a hint of tenderness in his eyes, and the boy started eating as well. However, his attention was all on the girl, causing him to accidentally knock off the lid of his lunchbox.
0:2:43|0:2:46|Years have passed, the grown-up He Qiaoqiao is now making porcelain.
0:2:54|0:3:2|She picked up the porcelain on the table and walked towards [Li Xing], who held the bowl and fed the soup by hand.
0:3:7|0:3:13|[Li Xing] was slurping his soup when [He Qiaoqiao] noticed something. She took out a band-aid, tore open the packaging,
0:3:13|0:3:20|After applying the band-aid, [He Qiaoqiao] kissed the wound.
0:3:33|0:3:36|[He Qiaoqiao] suddenly kissed [Li Xing].
0:3:36|0:3:42|Amid the cheers of their friends, the two kissed, and [He Qiaoqiao] shyly covered her face.
0:3:42|0:3:50|As graduation season approaches, [He Qiaoqiao] and [Li Xing] excitedly throw their mortarboards into the air. The scene then shifts to a restaurant five years ago.
0:4:59|0:5:10|After pressing the button, [Li Xing] stared at the other person with an incredulous look on his face. The boss took the contract and looked at the two of them. [He Qiaoqiao] picked up her bag and was about to leave, then turned to look at [Li Xing].
0:5:10|0:5:16|He Qiaoqiao's index finger slowly approached the corner of Li Xing's mouth, causing him to smile with a gentle expression.
0:5:18|0:5:26|Her expression was complicated as she stared at Li Xing's eyes for a long time. He Qiaoqiao turned around and left, leaving Li Xing sitting there.
0:5:26|0:5:34|The scene shifts, [He Qiaoqiao] slowly walks towards a bridal shop on the street, the brand - Lan Yu, that she mentioned to [Li Xing] when they broke up.
0:5:34|0:5:46|She looked at the wedding dress in the shop window, then picked up her camera and took a photo through the glass. The photo slowly slid out, and she looked down at it for a long time as the scene gradually faded away.
0:5:47|0:5:55|With the music playing, the words "Breakup Contract" slowly appear on the screen, one day several years later.
0:5:55|0:6:4|[He Qiaoqiao] opens the cabinet, takes out the bottles and jars inside, then she unscrews the bottle cap, holds the medicine bottles together with her hands, and squats over the toilet.
0:6:5|0:6:14|He Qiaoqiao tossed the pills into the toilet one by one, took a deep breath, ceremoniously closed the toilet lid, and pressed the flush button.
0:6:14|0:6:23|As the water flowed away, she couldn't help but laugh, then picked up the phone on the sink and made a call.
0:6:28|0:6:33|[He Qiaoqiao] uncovered the bowl of soup, tasted it carefully, while [Mao Mao] looked at her expectantly.
0:6:43|0:6:48|[Mao Mao] laughed on the side, [He Qiaoqiao] also forced a smile at [Mao Mao] twice, then walked away.
0:6:51|0:6:57|Years later, [Li Xing] has also become the head chef of a high-end restaurant, and a waiter brings a dish to [Li Xing]'s table.
0:6:58|0:7:1|[Li Xing] puts the finishing touches on the dishes.
0:7:1|0:7:9|On the other side, [He Qiaoqiao] and [Mao Mao] arrived at another restaurant, where [He Qiaoqiao] carefully examined the spaghetti.
0:7:13|0:7:20|[He Qiaoqiao] fingers twirl around the plate filled with food.
0:7:31|0:7:34|[Mao Mao] awkwardly responded.
0:7:34|0:7:37|On the other side, [Li Xing] was skillfully cutting fish in the kitchen.
0:7:37|0:7:44|He Qiaoqiao demonstrated while pouring water, and at this moment, she picked up a piece of raw fish.
0:7:44|0:7:52|[He Qiaoqiao] puts a piece of sashimi into her mouth, savoring it slowly as she chews.
0:8:0|0:8:5|In the kitchen, [Li Xing] watches the chef cutting fish and casually picks up the sliced fish.
0:9:1|0:9:7|[He Qiaoqiao] ran to check her phone messages. She put down the phone and picked up the medicine, and [Mao Mao] hurried over when she saw it.
0:11:1|0:11:10|[He Qiaoqiao] gave [Mao Mao] a white look and started eating noodles.
0:11:10|0:11:19|The phone vibrates, and a text message from [Li Xing] appears, saying: Call back when you're free. [He Qiaoqiao] proudly shows the message to [Mao Mao].
0:11:53|0:12:2|She carefully tore open the packaging and gently applied it to [Mao Mao]'s wound. [He Qiaoqiao] returned to the bedroom and dialed the phone with a smile on her face.
0:12:2|0:12:9|On the other side, [Li Xing] wrapped in a towel, drying his hair, walked out of the bathroom. It was a call from [He Qiaoqiao].
0:12:9|0:12:16|[Li Xing] quickly picked up his phone and answered the call.
0:12:19|0:12:27|[Li Xing] hesitated for a moment.
0:13:33|0:13:42|Feeling regretful about her previous reaction, [He Qiaoqiao] then entered the living room, took down the freshly baked plates, and carefully wrapped them in newspapers.
0:13:43|0:13:45|Accompanied by the landing of the plane, [He Qiaoqiao] arrived in Beijing.
0:13:47|0:13:51|In the bustling city, she arrived at the entrance of a high-end restaurant, carrying a suitcase.
0:13:51|0:14:1|Running, she suddenly stopped at the door, tidied up her slightly messy hair, sighed, and walked into the restaurant with her suitcase.
0:14:1|0:14:6|At the entrance of the restaurant stands a freshly designed signboard, on which is written "Ruiju Art Project".
0:14:8|0:14:12|He Qiaoqiao chose a seat by the window after entering the restaurant.
0:14:12|0:14:21|The waiter hurried over with the menu.
0:14:36|0:14:42|The waiter was impressed by her gaze, bowed and left.
0:14:58|0:15:12|He posted the menu on the cabinet, in the restaurant: [He Qiaoqiao] looked at the covered soup bowl, sighed, smiled as she lifted the lid, then closed her eyes and lowered her head to smell.
0:15:12|0:15:19|Li Xing, now dressed in a suit, walked out. He Qiaoqiao was still immersed in the aroma of the soup and didn't notice Li Xing.
0:15:19|0:15:28|[Li Xing] walked towards [He Qiaoqiao], pulled out a chair and sat down across from her. [He Qiaoqiao] gazed at her long-lost ex-boyfriend, and the two of them shared a smile.
0:15:28|0:15:38|He Qiaoqiao's smile froze immediately. Li Xing saw it and gestured with his eyes for He Qiaoqiao to drink the soup. He Qiaoqiao picked up the spoon and tasted it.
0:16:30|0:16:37|[Li Xing] gentlemanly pulled out a chair, [Zhou Rui] thanked him, and [He Qiaoqiao] sat down awkwardly.
0:17:1|0:17:6|[Li Xing] finished speaking and kissed [Zhou Rui]. [He Qiaoqiao] looked a bit unhappy, and [Zhou Rui] asked with concern:
0:17:27|0:17:37|[He Qiaoqiao] took a sip of the soup, then furrowed her brows. After carefully tasting it, she looked at [Li Xing].
0:17:47|0:17:53|She continued speaking, facing [Li Xing]'s gaze.
0:18:43|0:18:51|[Zhou Rui] accidentally knocked over the gift of [He Qiaoqiao] in front of the bridal shop. [Li Xing] helped his fianc√©e open the car door, and the two walked hand in hand.
0:18:51|0:18:59|[He Qiaoqiao] closed the car door and followed closely. When they arrived at the entrance of the shop, she was a bit surprised. [He Qiaoqiao] then followed the two of them into the bridal shop.
0:19:37|0:19:45|[He Qiaoqiao] and [Li Xing] glared at each other in anger, [Zhou Rui] quickly stepped in to defuse the situation.
0:20:12|0:20:18|[Li Xing] personally selected the wedding dress, and when [He Qiaoqiao] saw this scene, her eyebrows were raised.
0:20:25|0:20:34|[Zhou Rui] followed the shop assistant to the fitting room, [Li Xing] stared at [He Qiaoqiao] with a smile that wasn't a smile, and [He Qiaoqiao] squinted her eyes when she saw it. Inside the fitting room:
0:21:35|0:21:41|[Zhou Rui] finished speaking, then walked past [He Qiaoqiao] while wiping her shoulder. She picked up a glass of water and handed it to [He Qiaoqiao].
0:23:14|0:23:24|[He Qiaoqiao] looked helplessly at the two of them. The scene shifted to a luxurious villa area, where the lake was accompanied by beautiful scenery, and an Audi with a Beijing license plate parked at the entrance of the villa area.
0:23:25|0:23:32|[He Qiaoqiao] watches the two of them kissing goodbye from the back seat, while [Zhou Rui] opens the car door and leaves.
0:23:37|0:23:41|[He Qiaoqiao] breathed a sigh of relief as [Li Xing] turned to look at her and started the car.
0:23:41|0:23:46|The Audi car is driving on the road, with [Li Xing] focused on driving and [He Qiaoqiao] giving a fake smile after listening.
0:23:48|0:23:53|[Li Xing] put away his smile and gazed at the road ahead.
0:24:3|0:24:9|[Li Xing] smiled with relief, and [He Qiaoqiao] asked eagerly:
0:25:15|0:25:20|[He Qiaoqiao] glanced at [Li Xing] without saying a word, and the vehicle quickly arrived at an apartment.
0:25:48|0:26:1|[He Qiaoqiao] turned and walked away after hearing, [Li Xing] caught up and hugged her into the room, the door opened. [Li Xing] pushed [He Qiaoqiao] in, and she looked around the room in surprise, covering her face with a hat.
0:27:8|0:27:14|[He Qiaoqiao] smiled and tried to enter the bathroom, but [Li Xing] suddenly reached out his arm to stop her.
0:27:35|0:27:41|[He Qiaoqiao] followed closely behind, and she rushed to the stove.
0:28:2|0:28:10|[He Qiaoqiao] reached out to hit, but [Li Xing] stopped her and found her wound.
0:28:12|0:28:19|[He Qiaoqiao] gave [Li Xing] a white look, [Li Xing] reached out his hand and stared at her without moving, [He Qiaoqiao] took out a band-aid from her jacket pocket and threw it onto [Li Xing]'s hand.
0:28:37|0:28:42|[He Qiaoqiao] winced in pain again and cried out, causing [Li Xing], who was leaving, to suddenly turn around.
0:28:45|0:28:53|[He Qiaoqiao] covers the gift box on the table, [Li Xing] throws the room key to [He Qiaoqiao], then he turns and leaves.
0:28:55|0:29:9|[He Qiaoqiao] watched him leave, pouted and threw the keys on the table. She then blew on her injured fingers, tore open the band-aid packaging, and suddenly froze as she thought of something, then he opened the carefully prepared gift box.
0:29:10|0:29:17|Seeing the broken plates in the box, she is very upset. She picks up the pieces and tries to put them back together.
0:29:17|0:29:26|Unfortunately, what's done is done. The broken plate cannot be restored. In the next scene, [He Qiaoqiao] is seen in pajamas, dancing wildly on [Li Xing]'s wedding bed.
0:29:26|0:29:33|She then opened the suitcase and dumped all the clothes on the bed, picking up the underwear and hanging it on the hanger.
0:29:33|0:29:41|The scene cuts to the bathroom, where [He Qiaoqiao] brushes her teeth while placing skincare products on the cabinet. She uses the toothbrush as a toy and splashes water on the mirror.
0:29:41|0:29:44|The lights in the room are all on, [He Qiaoqiao] is throwing pillows on the sofa.
0:29:44|0:29:52|Before long, she started throwing tissues again, then went to the kitchen to grab some snacks. She peeled crayfish while talking on the phone.
0:30:5|0:30:10|[Mao Mao] sat up from the sofa with a face mask on, while [He Qiaoqiao] kept chewing food.
0:30:27|0:30:32|[He Qiaoqiao] listened and immediately threw away the crayfish, while spitting out the food in her mouth.
0:30:41|0:30:51|[He Qiaoqiao] enjoyed a moment in the bathtub with her eyes closed, then she moved to the living room to practice yoga.
0:30:51|0:30:58|She extended her left hand forward, lifted her right foot with her right hand, and soon fell asleep on the sofa with a loud snore.
0:31:0|0:31:14|The next day, [Li Xing] paced in front of the car as if waiting for someone. A taxi pulled up, he hailed it, then walked around the front of the car to the side where the taxi door was opened and [He Qiaoqiao] got out.
0:31:19|0:31:25|[Zhou Rui] waved to [He Qiaoqiao] from across the street, and [He Qiaoqiao] awkwardly waved back.
0:33:34|0:33:42|[Mao Mao] hung up the phone and ran forward to snatch the bag from the man's hand. The male guest immediately took it back, and [Mao Mao] coquettishly said, then took the bag back.
0:33:55|0:34:3|Standing in front of the mirror, she was adjusting her clothes, looking at her reflection with her hands crossed in front of her chest.
0:34:3|0:34:20|Encouraged, [He Qiaoqiao] nodded slightly, picked up the bag beside her and rummaged through it. She took out the prepared foreign liquor, stared at it for a while, then carefully unscrewed the bottle cap. After the foreign liquor was opened, she closed her eyes and sniffed it, only to be repelled by the pungent smell of alcohol.
0:34:20|0:34:31|He Qiaoqiao, who had been drinking in the living room, tilted her head back and took a big gulp of the wine from the bottle. Li Xing, sitting on the sofa with his back to her, peeked out from behind the magazine.
0:34:32|0:34:37|[He Qiaoqiao] pulled back her head, then leaned out her whole body, slowly pacing with her right hand against the wall.
0:34:40|0:34:46|[Li Xing] left the sofa and moved closer to [He Qiaoqiao], she suddenly took off her coat to reveal a camisole dress, which surprised [Li Xing].
0:34:46|0:34:54|[He Qiaoqiao] raised her delicate hand and placed the other person's hand on her fragrant shoulder. With a hint of intoxication in her eyes, she stared closely at [Li Xing].
0:34:54|0:34:57|Suddenly, Li Xing's hand slid down.
0:34:59|0:35:3|[He Qiaoqiao] still doesn't give up, seizing the opportunity to grab [Li Xing]'s face and trying to kiss him forcefully.
0:35:3|0:35:9|[Li Xing] kept dodging and backing away, the two of them in the living room resembling a tango dance, one on the offensive,
0:35:9|0:35:17|He Qiaoqiao, who was trying to avoid, still didn't give up as they turned around each other and brushed past each other. Li Xing stared at her, forcing He Qiaoqiao, who kept twisting, to fall.
0:35:17|0:35:32|Suddenly, with a swift movement, [Li Xing] bent down and embraced her. As [Li Xing]'s face slowly approached, [He Qiaoqiao] also closed her eyes slowly. Just as they were about to kiss, [He Qiaoqiao] suddenly opened her eyes and mouth, and [Li Xing] caught a whiff of alcohol from her breath, then let go of her hand.
0:35:49|0:36:2|[He Qiaoqiao] took out the carefully prepared gift from the kitchen, tidied her hair and walked to [Li Xing]. Then, with a sprint, [Li Xing] was pushed down onto the sofa by the gift. [He Qiaoqiao] also sat down, keeping her gaze unchanged, and nodded.
0:36:4|0:36:15|[Li Xing] looked at the gift in his hand and smiled. Then he stood up from the sofa with the gift, pretending to look around. When [He Qiaoqiao] wasn't paying attention, he suddenly ran past her.
0:36:18|0:36:25|[He Qiaoqiao] turned to look at [Li Xing], who kept walking away. As [Li Xing] left, [He Qiaoqiao] looked regretful and shook her head abruptly.
0:36:26|0:36:31|The stage lights up, and the Chef King Competition begins.
0:38:42|0:38:48|Applause continued on the field, with the opponents also applauding and praising.
0:38:55|0:39:6|[He Qiaoqiao] is very happy. She takes out a camera from her backpack and stands in front of the TV, filming herself and [Li Xing].
0:39:6|0:39:22|[He Qiaoqiao] captured the moment and took a selfie with [Li Xing] on TV. Outside the studio, [He Qiaoqiao] rushed to the recording scene with her backpack. She walked through the corridor to the backstage, but her happiness was interrupted by a conversation.
0:39:57|0:40:5|[He Qiaoqiao] felt uncomfortable because of the loud shouting.
0:40:52|0:41:0|[He Qiaoqiao] sat on the roadside, feeling sad, when suddenly [Li Xing] called.
0:41:30|0:41:40|[Li Xing] happily hung up the phone, [He Qiaoqiao] was a bit flustered and quickly called back to [Mao Mao].
0:42:22|0:42:29|The crowd cheered and applauded at the words, making [Zhou Rui] very happy to see this scene.
0:43:17|0:43:25|[Li Xing] turned around and pressed [Mao Mao] with his body.
0:43:42|0:43:49|[Li Xing] is lying on top of [Mao Mao].
0:43:49|0:43:58|The two pressed their hands together again, [Zhou Rui] was very surprised because she saw [Li Xing] leaning against [Mao Mao]'s waist for support, and in the end [Li Xing] couldn't hold on and fell sideways.
0:43:58|0:44:7|The outcome is clear, [Mao Mao] is getting up, with an incredulous look on her face.
0:46:37|0:46:43|[He Qiaoqiao] was about to kiss [Mao Mao], but was interrupted by a series of gasps, as it turned out [Li Xing] and [Zhou Rui] were kissing passionately.
0:46:57|0:47:5|Thank you, the advantage will be delivered immediately, hurry up.
0:47:5|0:47:12|During the toast, [Li Xing] secretly glanced at [He Qiaoqiao].
0:47:22|0:47:30|Friends left one by one, leaving only [He Qiaoqiao], [Li Xing], and their partners.
0:47:32|0:47:39|[Li Xing] was a bit puzzled. He glanced at [Zhou Rui] beside him and then went forward to shake hands with [Mao Mao].
0:47:41|0:47:47|[Zhou Rui] waved goodbye to [He Qiaoqiao]. She watched as [Li Xing] got on the car.
0:47:49|0:47:57|[He Qiaoqiao]'s expression instantly turned cold, [Mao Mao] and [He Qiaoqiao] stood on the roadside watching the car slowly drive away.
0:48:25|0:48:30|The staff were placing He Qiaoqiao's works in an orderly manner, while Mao Mao urged her to sign.
0:48:30|0:48:32|But she was staring blankly ahead.
0:48:32|0:48:39|This is actually a painting.
0:48:43|0:48:57|[Mao Mao] walked to the side of [He Qiaoqiao], turned to look at the painting in front of her. The horizon divided the picture into two parts, with the sky above and the sea below, and [He Qiaoqiao] just watched quietly.
0:49:27|0:49:31|The phone rang, and He Qiaoqiao received a message from Li Xing, who thought Mao Mao was very good.
0:49:31|0:49:38|Someone can accompany [He Qiaoqiao], then he can be at ease. [He Qiaoqiao] looks at [Mao Mao] and angrily throws the phone on the ground.
0:49:38|0:49:47|[Mao Mao] was picking up her phone on the ground, while [He Qiaoqiao] returned to [Li Xing]'s bridal chamber. As she was tidying up her clothes, the phone rang again, with a message from [Mao Mao].
0:49:47|0:49:55|Tell [He Qiaoqiao] that although the tide has receded, it will rise again in a few hours. [He Qiaoqiao] rests her chin on her phone, seemingly lost in thought.
0:49:55|0:50:8|She put down her phone and started packing her luggage, as the sound of the door opening came from outside.
0:50:13|0:50:29|[Li Xing] looked a bit flustered upon hearing this, turned to look at [He Qiaoqiao] upstairs, and silently lowered her head.
0:50:34|0:50:42|It was particularly quiet in the alley at night, with [He Qiaoqiao] and [Li Xing] walking side by side.
0:50:44|0:50:57|The two looked at the restaurant on the side of the road, with the sign "Red Leaf Stone Nan" written on it. [Li Xing] looked at [He Qiaoqiao], took big steps towards the restaurant, and [He Qiaoqiao] followed after a moment of hesitation. The scene shifted back to 5 years ago.
0:50:57|0:51:5|It was when they broke up, pouring rain that day, [Li Xing] and [He Qiaoqiao] arrived at the restaurant with an umbrella.
0:51:8|0:51:15|[Li Xing] was gulping down a bottle of Beibingyang soda, while [He Qiaoqiao] was eating cold dishes absentmindedly, seeming to be preoccupied.
0:51:16|0:51:20|[Li Xing] was eating cold dishes while looking at [He Qiaoqiao] beside him, with a happy expression on his face.
0:51:25|0:51:33|The boss walked in and, Li Xing, took the opportunity to stand up and walk to He Qiaoqiao's side. Li Xing cleared his throat and suddenly knelt down on one knee.
0:51:45|0:51:51|[Li Xing] slowly took out a ring after finishing speaking.
0:51:52|0:52:1|[He Qiaoqiao] gaze lingered between the ring and [Li Xing]'s face, while [Li Xing] looked at the other with anticipation written all over his face.
0:52:39|0:52:47|[He Qiaoqiao] hesitated to speak, she took the ring and examined it carefully.
0:53:52|0:53:59|He immediately turned his head at the words, his eyes fixed on the ceiling, while [He Qiaoqiao] stared ahead expressionlessly.
0:54:7|0:54:15|Outside the restaurant, it was pouring rain. [He Qiaoqiao] ran out from inside, suppressing her emotions until they suddenly burst out, tears mixing with the rain.
0:54:15|0:54:18|She left covering her mouth.
0:54:18|0:54:25|The scene rewinds to the present, as the restaurant owner takes out the contract signed by He Qiaoqiao and Li Xing when they broke up from the exquisite wooden box.
0:54:36|0:54:45|The boss chuckled at the words and handed over the contract in his hand. The two looked at the contract on the table, then at each other.
0:54:45|0:54:52|[He Qiaoqiao] suddenly picked up the contract and tore it up, causing the boss to furrow his brow.
0:55:0|0:55:5|The boss helplessly crossed his arms as He Qiaoqiao looked at Li Xing.
0:55:31|0:55:39|Her eyes welled up with tears, the tears swirling in her eyes as she turned her head to look at [Li Xing], who was also staring at her.
0:55:40|0:55:48|The restaurant owner lowered his head at the words, [He Qiaoqiao] paused, trying hard to control her emotions.
0:56:5|0:56:12|[He Qiaoqiao] got up and left, [Li Xing] stopped her, picking up the envelope on the table.
0:56:13|0:56:22|[He Qiaoqiao] said nothing, tears welling up in her eyes, and [Li Xing] pushed her back into her seat.
0:56:27|0:56:33|Master Nan took the envelope from [Li Xing] and opened it, smiling as he read the contents.
0:56:34|0:56:51|Passing it to [He Qiaoqiao] who was sitting, [He Qiaoqiao] took a closer look and froze instantly. It turned out to be a wedding invitation with [He Qiaoqiao] and [Li Xing]'s names printed on it. She looked at [Li Xing] in disbelief.
0:57:16|0:57:24|[He Qiaoqiao] was greatly surprised by everything in front of her, and she asked eagerly:
0:57:47|0:57:53|[He Qiaoqiao] turned her head to sniffle, then locked eyes with [Li Xing].
0:58:17|0:58:35|Facing [Li Xing], [He Qiaoqiao] regained her little temper. She gave [Li Xing] a white eye and turned her head to avoid eye contact. [He Qiaoqiao] turned her head and looked at [Li Xing] with a grievance. [Li Xing] tried to play the same trick again, but his hands were dodged by the other party.
0:58:40|0:58:47|Outside the alley, [Li Xing] catches up with [He Qiaoqiao], grabbing her and the two of them gaze at each other under a tree.
0:58:48|0:58:59|[Li Xing] looked into [He Qiaoqiao]'s eyes and said, "[He Qiaoqiao]" tried to break free after listening, but was forcefully pulled back by the other party, then [Li Xing] kissed her.
0:59:1|0:59:6|Time seemed to stand still as [Li Xing]'s hands slowly reached around the other's waist.
0:59:7|0:59:16|The elevator doors slowly open, and the entwined couple walks out from inside. [He Qiaoqiao] tries to escape, but is caught by [Li Xing] in a firm grip, like a little lamb.
0:59:16|0:59:23|He Qiaoqiao and Li Xing, pressed against the door, finally let out the suppressed emotions of 5 years in this moment, happily chasing each other in the corridor.
0:59:24|0:59:30|[Li Xing] stops [He Qiaoqiao] in front of the door and says to him seriously:
0:59:37|0:59:52|[He Qiaoqiao] kissed [Li Xing] through the keyhole, then opened the door. [Li Xing] kissed her again. He tried to enter the room, but was rejected by her.
0:59:57|1:0:15|She happily rolled against the wall, carefully recalling the recent events. She couldn't help but laugh again, feeling unprecedented joy. Suddenly, she opened her bag, took out her phone, dialed [Mao Mao]'s number, eager to share her feelings with the other party.
1:0:43|1:0:53|[Li Xing] walked towards [Mao Mao], suddenly grabbed his bag while he was handling the procedures. [Mao Mao] chased after him and found out that the other person was waiting for him.
1:1:22|1:1:28|She sat on the sofa and suddenly sneezed, coughing, covering her mouth with her right hand.
1:1:35|1:1:41|[He Qiaoqiao] looked at the pool of blood in her palm, placed it back in its original position, her lips turning pale, and struggled to breathe as she held the phone in her left hand.
1:1:42|1:1:48|One moment she was happy, but the next moment she seemed like a different person, suddenly becoming sad.
1:1:58|1:2:6|Silently hanging up the phone, the restless [He Qiaoqiao] looked nervously towards the door, and the scene gradually faded as she turned her head.
1:2:14|1:2:23|[Li Xing] lowered his head to cook, his emotions unreadable. [He Qiaoqiao] arrived at Peking University Shougang Hospital. In the examination room, the doctor looked at [He Qiaoqiao]'s test report.
1:2:23|1:2:30|Sitting across from her, her expression was very heart-wrenching. The doctor sighed and said, "[He Qiaoqiao] is not speaking."
1:2:48|1:2:54|Alone and helpless, [He Qiaoqiao] sheds tears while holding medicine.
1:3:11|1:3:23|She is facing away from the camera, so no expression can be seen on her face.
1:3:25|1:3:32|In the evening, [He Qiaoqiao] walked heavily on the sidewalk, looking very lonely.
1:3:35|1:3:41|[Li Xing] temporarily left the celebration party and took out his phone to call [He Qiaoqiao]. As [He Qiaoqiao] walked down the street, she glanced at her phone.
1:3:41|1:3:50|On the other end of the phone, [Li Xing] was full of anticipation, but she didn't answer the call. The sadness in her eyes and brows couldn't be hidden, and she continued to walk away with a heavy heart.
1:3:50|1:3:59|Unable to reach [Li Xing] on the phone, he put down his phone, his expression somewhat frozen. Outside the wedding room of [Li Xing], [He Qiaoqiao] dragged a suitcase out of the door.
1:3:59|1:4:3|She stood there for a long time, as if bidding farewell to everything in front of her.
1:4:3|1:4:11|She closed the door and hesitated to leave the room that belonged to her and [Li Xing] in the future, which was gradually becoming distant.
1:4:11|1:4:14|She ultimately chose to turn around and leave.
1:4:14|1:4:20|From one person coming to one person leaving, the only companion she seems to have is the suitcase by her side.
1:4:20|1:4:35|The scene shifts, with trees growing straight in the forest blocking out some of the sky. Rows of tombstones are neatly arranged under the trees. [He Qiaoqiao] is holding a bouquet of flowers, bending down in front of a tombstone, lowering her head to gaze at it.
1:4:35|1:4:44|It seems like she was talking to him, but after He Qiaoqiao finished speaking, she fell into a long silence, her eyes downcast.
1:4:44|1:4:53|The sadness seemed to have been exhausted, fate played a big joke on her, but she couldn't laugh.
1:4:53|1:4:58|Feeling utterly dejected, [Li Xing] hurriedly arrived at the entrance of the bridal chamber and took out his phone to answer a call.
1:5:8|1:5:15|[He Qiaoqiao] fell silent for a moment, then [Li Xing] turned and walked away, hanging up the phone.
1:5:17|1:5:25|Walking briskly, He Qiaoqiao headed towards the exit, while Li Xing sat on a bench in the campus waiting for her. It was where their relationship began.
1:5:26|1:5:35|[He Qiaoqiao] walked towards [Li Xing], with a forced smile on her face. [Li Xing] didn't notice anything unusual about her, and looked at her with a smile on his face.
1:5:36|1:5:43|[Li Xing] stood up, covering his hands, and turned to face [He Qiaoqiao].
1:5:45|1:5:52|[Li Xing] slowly revealed the small box in his palm, kneeling down to open it.
1:5:52|1:6:1|[He Qiaoqiao] had a wandering gaze, then burst into laughter.
1:6:1|1:6:7|[Li Xing] smiled when she smiled.
1:6:30|1:6:36|[Li Xing] looked somewhat incredulous. His tone gradually became more serious.
1:6:46|1:6:55|[He Qiaoqiao] is trying hard to conceal her emotions.
1:7:15|1:7:24|[Li Xing] frowned, while [He Qiaoqiao] pondered for a moment.
1:7:33|1:7:44|[Li Xing] made a final attempt to persuade [He Qiaoqiao], who smiled and nodded. [Li Xing] gave up the struggle, turned around with anger and disappointment, and walked away.
1:7:46|1:7:54|[He Qiaoqiao] seemed to breathe a sigh of relief, but to her surprise, [Li Xing] suddenly turned back and walked angrily towards the other person.
1:8:6|1:8:12|[He Qiaoqiao] silently endured the other party's outburst, while [Li Xing] angrily left without looking back.
1:8:12|1:8:18|[He Qiaoqiao] took a deep breath, holding back the tears in her eyes, and looked up at the sky.
1:8:35|1:8:43|At the Chef King Competition, [Li Xing] stared heavily at the cutting board in front of him, while in the alley, [He Qiaoqiao] once again arrived at the Red Leaf Restaurant.
1:8:55|1:8:59|[He Qiaoqiao] slowly closed her eyes at the words, sitting quietly.
1:8:59|1:9:11|[Li Xing] returned to the bridal chamber, looking at the scene in the living room, as if reminiscing about the moments between the two. He looked up the stairs, and the girl who used to argue with him seemed to be right there.
1:9:12|1:9:16|He Qiaoqiao touched the furniture, carefully feeling the traces that had once existed.
1:9:16|1:9:26|He slowly walked towards the kitchen, looking around, and found a box of band-aids on the dining table. The innocent and mischievous girl always had the habit of carrying band-aids with her.
1:9:26|1:9:35|[Li Xing] walked slowly towards it, carefully picked it up, his left index finger was injured in the competition and still wrapped in a band-aid.
1:9:35|1:9:49|And this time, the girl who took care of him has already left. He slowly picks up the band-aid, turns it over, and on the back of the band-aid is the smiley face drawn by [He Qiaoqiao] for him, as if reminding him to take care of himself.
1:9:49|1:9:55|[Li Xing] then arrived at the Red Leaf Restaurant, only to find that it had already closed.
1:9:55|1:9:59|He looked somewhat frustrated, furrowed his brow, and turned away.
1:9:59|1:10:6|At this moment, the restaurant owner, Master Nan, walked out from the shop, and [Li Xing] turned his head to look at the boss.
1:10:17|1:10:23|[Li Xing] scanned the menu, unable to make a choice for a moment.
1:10:24|1:10:32|[Li Xing] looked at the boss in confusion at the words.
1:10:38|1:10:44|The boss listened as [Li Xing] slowly said:
1:10:55|1:11:2|Quickly looking at the menu, trying to find any hidden clues from it, it turns out that [He Qiaoqiao] has been here all these years.
1:11:13|1:11:29|Five menus put together to form five characters. I am by your side, [Li Xing] lost in thought. Suddenly, he has an epiphany and rushes out of the restaurant. Gasping for breath, [Li Xing] arrives at the exhibition hall and asks the staff next to him:
1:11:38|1:11:42|He Qiaoqiao took out his phone from the pocket of his jacket as he walked, with an anxious look on his face, and dialed a number.
1:11:44|1:11:58|The phone call was not answered, and [Li Xing] looked around anxiously. He hung up the phone and put it back in his pocket. His attention was caught by an exhibit - a broken plate with a large crack splitting it in half.
1:11:59|1:12:2|Even after being repaired, the cracks are still clearly visible.
1:12:2|1:12:9|The exhibit was named after me by the creator, and [Li Xing] seemed to have guessed something as he looked flustered and slowly walked away.
1:12:9|1:12:28|Suddenly accelerating and running, amidst the roar the plane slowly takes off, the Oriental Pearl Tower stands proudly by the Huangpu River, cars coming and going on the cross-sea bridge, [Li Xing] arrives in a Shanghai taxi, heavy-hearted with [He Qiaoqiao]'s disappearance, making him very anxious.
1:12:29|1:12:34|He then arrived at the entrance of the studio of [He Qiaoqiao], where life garbage and cardboard boxes were piled up outside the door.
1:12:34|1:12:42|He approached and found the house was for rent. He knocked on the door and observed the interior from the doorway.
1:12:42|1:12:50|The room was empty, with no sign of [He Qiaoqiao].
1:13:0|1:13:8|[Mao Mao] pretended to have poor signal and intentionally hung up the phone, while [Li Xing] stood outside [He Qiaoqiao]'s studio window, deep in thought, and then left.
1:13:8|1:13:16|[Li Xing] drove back to Beijing, speeding along the road as the street scenes kept receding behind. Inside the exhibition hall, [Mao Mao] was counting the exhibits with the staff.
1:13:16|1:13:22|[Li Xing] slowly appears and walks towards [Mao Mao], who seems to have a realization and looks back.
1:13:33|1:13:40|He Qiaoqiao kept a close eye on [Mao Mao], while Li Xing tried to control his emotions.
1:13:57|1:14:3|[Mao Mao] looked at [Li Xing], who picked up a plate in the warehouse.
1:14:4|1:14:10|Mao Mao looked incredulous.
1:15:38|1:15:45|[Mao Mao] lowered her head and cried in pain, while [Li Xing] stepped forward and grabbed his face.
1:15:58|1:16:2|He recalled what He Qiaoqiao had said, speeding all the way down the hospital corridor.
1:16:2|1:16:10|[Li Xing] rushed to the triage desk anxiously and asked the night shift nurse, who lowered her head to search.
1:16:12|1:16:17|[Li Xing] turned and left upon hearing this, anxiously searching the corridor for the room. He longed to meet [He Qiaoqiao].
1:16:17|1:16:26|To find out her current situation, he finally saw [He Qiaoqiao] through the glass on the door, lying asleep on the hospital bed.
1:16:26|1:16:34|[Li Xing] gently pushed the door open and entered, greeted by various medical instruments surrounding [He Qiaoqiao], who was lying on the bed in a hospital gown, her head turned to the side.
1:16:34|1:16:38|[Li Xing] stared at her as she slowly approached, his face filled with tenderness.
1:16:38|1:16:44|The once lively and innocent girl was tortured by illness, her face full of weakness.
1:16:44|1:16:52|[Li Xing] bent down and gently grabbed [He Qiaoqiao]'s hand, slowly squatting down. He dared not make a loud noise, afraid of waking up the girl lying on the sickbed.
1:16:52|1:17:1|Just watching her quietly, as if wanting to engrave her in his heart, [He Qiaoqiao] had pale lips, and [Li Xing] saw everything in his eyes.
1:17:1|1:17:10|Tears welled up in his eyes, he slowly turned his head to the side, afraid to cry too loudly, he hesitated to believe everything in front of him.
1:17:10|1:17:18|Beside the hospital bed, [Li Xing] discovered a photo album. He slowly picked it up and looked at it carefully, his eyes filled with disbelief.
1:17:18|1:17:27|It seemed like he could anticipate the contents of this album. He pursed his lips, carefully opened it, and started to look at it attentively.
1:17:27|1:17:39|On the first page are two photos, capturing his daily life. Tears silently slide down from [Li Xing]'s eyes as he looks at [He Qiaoqiao] on the bed and turns to another page, which is a graduation photo.
1:17:39|1:17:47|The scene captures their transition from school to society. As the album turns to the next page, there is [He Qiaoqiao] in the coveted Lan Yu wedding dress.
1:17:47|1:17:56|He took these photos through the shop window, and [Li Xing]'s emotions gradually collapsed along with the photos. He knelt on the ground in pain, sobbing.
1:17:56|1:18:2|He saw a photo of the two kissing in the album, a beautiful memory before they separated.
1:18:2|1:18:10|He saw [He Qiaoqiao] taking a selfie alone in the battle against the illness, she was wearing a hospital gown in the photo, but always had a smile on her face.
1:18:10|1:18:12|[Li Xing] silently weeps.
1:18:12|1:18:20|The strong man is so fragile at this moment, outside the hospital, Li Xing's car is blocking the entrance causing a traffic jam.
1:18:58|1:19:7|[Li Xing] was collapsing on the roadside, crying bitterly. His apology seemed to have come a little too late.
1:19:7|1:19:13|The passerby forgave him, but in the hospital room, can [He Qiaoqiao] hear it?
1:19:13|1:19:15|In the Beijing University Shougang Hospital
1:19:28|1:19:46|Three round lunch boxes are placed in a row, filled with tempting food that smells delicious. [He Qiaoqiao] has a big appetite, picks up her chopsticks to pick up some food, while [Mao Mao] looks at her expectantly. [He Qiaoqiao] chews the food carefully after putting it into her mouth, then nods in satisfaction at [Mao Mao].
1:20:18|1:20:25|[He Qiaoqiao] looked at the dishes in front of her, feeling a bit silent. After a moment of contemplation, [He Qiaoqiao] said:
1:20:26|1:20:31|She paused and continued speaking. [Mao Mao] turned her head away and stopped asking further.
1:20:31|1:20:38|[He Qiaoqiao] looked at him with a worried expression and asked.
1:20:54|1:20:58|In the late night restaurant, there was no one around, only the kitchen lights were still on.
1:20:58|1:21:5|[Li Xing] puts caviar in the dish, preparing a lunchbox carefully for [He Qiaoqiao].
1:21:8|1:21:31|Sitting on the hospital bed, [He Qiaoqiao] looked at [Mao Mao] with surprise, eating the exquisite food in the lunchbox. She said thoughtfully, "A radish flower is garnished on the meat, it's still [Li Xing] preparing the meal." [He Qiaoqiao] looked at the delicate food in the lunchbox, picked up the meat and tasted it carefully, enduring the stomach pain as she tried hard to take a bite.
1:21:34|1:21:49|In the kitchen, busy [Li Xing] took out his phone. [Mao Mao] texted him that [He Qiaoqiao] couldn't eat today. [Li Xing] felt worried, and in the hospital room, [He Qiaoqiao] started retching.
1:21:56|1:22:3|In the kitchen, [Li Xing] is preparing desserts for [He Qiaoqiao], with the lunch box filled with delicious strawberry cake and taro cake.
1:22:7|1:22:11|On the other side, [He Qiaoqiao] covered her mouth, trying to adjust her state, and handed out the lunch box.
1:22:11|1:22:20|Mao Mao looked at her with a worried expression on her face.
1:22:23|1:22:29|[He Qiaoqiao] shook her head, tears slowly falling down.
1:22:30|1:22:37|[Mao Mao] felt very sorry, but didn't know how to comfort, so she could only silently lower her head to tidy up the lunch box.
1:22:37|1:22:46|[He Qiaoqiao] made up her mind, her eyes determined. Upon hearing this, [Mao Mao] immediately walked to [He Qiaoqiao]'s side and said to her:
1:22:47|1:22:54|[He Qiaoqiao], with tears still in her eyes, had a firm determination to leave the hospital. She looked at [Mao Mao] and held his hand, pleading:
1:23:3|1:23:31|[He Qiaoqiao] held [Mao Mao]'s hands. [Mao Mao] turned his head to the side, and [He Qiaoqiao] choked up, saying: [He Qiaoqiao] looked up at [Mao Mao], who sniffed and looked out the window.
1:23:31|1:23:46|He Qiaoqiao said with a heavy heart, "The more she thinks, the sadder she becomes," as he refused to face it all.
1:23:46|1:23:54|[Mao Mao] knows the feelings between the two, and he is sadder than [He Qiaoqiao].
1:23:55|1:24:2|[Mao Mao] turned his head to the side, trying hard to hold back his emotions and tears, while [He Qiaoqiao] looked at him pleadingly.
1:24:4|1:24:12|Sunlight streamed into the ward as the two held hands and gazed at each other in silence. [He Qiaoqiao], who was discharged from the hospital, sat quietly at the bar in the Red Leaf Restaurant.
1:24:12|1:24:17|She caressed the table, then stood in front of the restaurant door.
1:24:19|1:24:25|She looked back at the familiar surroundings of the restaurant.
1:24:27|1:24:35|She pushed the door open and took a step of her own, the afternoon sunlight shining through the leaves with extra gentleness.
1:24:35|1:24:43|In the bustling street, [He Qiaoqiao] walks in the alley, looking at everything in front of her as if bidding farewell.
1:24:43|1:24:50|[Li Xing] quietly appeared behind [He Qiaoqiao], closely following her, and that's how [He Qiaoqiao] walked through the streets and alleys.
1:24:50|1:24:55|She looked at the scenery on the roadside, occasionally reaching out to touch the branches and leaves beside her.
1:24:55|1:25:12|[Li Xing] silently followed behind, observing every move of [He Qiaoqiao], looking at the girl sitting on the bench. Despite being of similar age, their destinies were completely different. She hesitated for a moment and stopped in her tracks, with [Li Xing] stopping as well.
1:25:12|1:25:22|Watching [He Qiaoqiao] cheering herself up, [Li Xing] saw [He Qiaoqiao] picking clothes in the store through the window. Her body could no longer support her vigorous movements.
1:25:22|1:25:24|She struggled to walk out of the glass shop door.
1:25:25|1:25:31|[Li Xing] walked towards her, and [He Qiaoqiao] slowly stopped in her tracks when she saw him.
1:25:31|1:25:42|The two gazed at each other for a long time. Suddenly, Li Xing smiled, and He Qiaoqiao was also infected, her lips curling up. He Qiaoqiao nodded at the words and thought for a moment before saying:
1:25:53|1:26:0|[He Qiaoqiao] avoided eye contact, she was about to leave but was called back. [Li Xing] gently said:
1:26:13|1:26:21|[Li Xing] smiled and shook his head, saying to her.
1:26:22|1:26:28|[Li Xing]'s attitude surprised [He Qiaoqiao], and the two of them entered the bridal chamber at night.
1:26:40|1:26:46|He opened the lid, revealing the long-lost smile of [He Qiaoqiao].
1:26:57|1:27:5|She scooped up a small bite with a spoon, just as she brought it to her mouth, she stopped, the pain in her body making it hard for her to breathe.
1:27:5|1:27:15|She struggled to swallow the porridge, [Li Xing] looked at her expectantly, and in order not to disappoint him, she took another sip.
1:27:15|1:27:24|[He Qiaoqiao] couldn't bear it anymore, the physical pain made her vomit all the food. [Li Xing] took out a tissue and handed it to her.
1:27:37|1:27:39|[Li Xing] turned his head to look at the other person.
1:27:39|1:27:45|[He Qiaoqiao] was startled by the ringing, and [Li Xing] snatched the phone away.
1:27:58|1:28:4|[Li Xing] handed her a glass of water, and [He Qiaoqiao] took the glass of water.
1:28:4|1:28:8|Struggling to swallow the pills, [Li Xing] didn't expose her lie.
1:28:8|1:28:13|Just watching her quietly, [He Qiaoqiao] picked up the spoon again, not wanting to disappoint the other person's kindness.
1:28:14|1:28:19|The porridge was right in front of her, but she just couldn't bring herself to eat it. [Li Xing] quickly stepped in to stop her.
1:28:22|1:28:31|He held He Qiaoqiao's hand and said, He Qiaoqiao looked a bit discouraged.
1:28:55|1:29:18|[Li Xing]'s words were like sharp knives, piercing [He Qiaoqiao]'s heart bit by bit. Unable to control her emotions, she quickly picked up her bag and left. [Li Xing] stood still, unable to hide his emotions, tears slowly streaming down his face. He lowered his head, choked up and unable to speak, as the stage lights came on and the cooking competition began.
1:29:40|1:29:48|At the beginning, [He Qiaoqiao] and [Mao Mao] also arrived at the scene, applauding for [Li Xing] in the audience. On stage, [Li Xing] had a calm expression.
1:29:48|1:29:55|He Qiaoqiao nervously watched as he picked up a tomato with his left hand and weighed it, anticipating his next move.
1:29:56|1:29:59|[Li Xing] puts unpeeled tomatoes into boiling water.
1:29:59|1:30:8|He Qiaoqiao skillfully peeled the small fire, then diced the salted bamboo shoots and peeled tomatoes. Other chefs on the scene also demonstrated their skills.
1:30:8|1:30:17|Using familiar tools to create exquisite dishes, [Li Xing] on stage, earnestly catches the eye of [He Qiaoqiao], leaving her in a trance.
1:31:2|1:31:15|[Li Xing] brought the bowl of soup to [He Qiaoqiao], bent down slowly, and squatted. It was a soup that [He Qiaoqiao] was very familiar with, and the container holding it was an aluminum lunch box used in high school to hold food.
1:31:38|1:31:45|[Li Xing] filled a spoonful of soup, gently blew on it, and then slowly brought it to [He Qiaoqiao]'s lips, saying:
1:31:52|1:31:59|[Li Xing] drank the soup under the expectant gaze. His eyes were a bit nervous, waiting for the outcome.
1:32:0|1:32:18|He Qiaoqiao nodded approvingly as Li Xing opened the box in his hand, revealing a delicate diamond ring lying inside. His gaze was firm, but his hand holding the ring was trembling slightly. He Qiaoqiao took a deep breath, trying hard to control her emotions.
1:32:21|1:32:27|[Li Xing]'s firm tone moved [He Qiaoqiao], who seemed to be struggling, and finally broke free from the imprisonment of self.
1:32:27|1:32:34|Li Xing no longer closes off his heart. He stares blankly at the person in front of him.
1:32:34|1:32:41|[He Qiaoqiao] didn't hesitate this time, nodded in agreement, and all the audience in the audience stood up and applauded for them.
1:32:41|1:32:48|Amidst the enthusiastic applause, [Li Xing] picked up the ring, and all the audience in the venue stood up to applaud for them.
1:32:48|1:33:1|Amidst enthusiastic applause, [Li Xing] picked up the ring. After going through ups and downs, they finally completed the 5-year breakup contract at this moment. The moment the ring was put on the ring finger, all the troubles vanished into thin air.
1:33:1|1:33:10|[Li Xing] passionately kisses the back of [He Qiaoqiao]'s hand, leaving her feeling a bit dazed, afraid that it might all be a dream. They embrace tightly, and in that moment, their love is as deep as can be.
1:33:10|1:33:18|[Li Xing] smiled happily, at this moment they became the center of attention for everyone, but in their eyes, there was only each other.
1:33:18|1:33:31|The night alley was slightly cold, [Li Xing] walked on the familiar road to the Red Leaf Restaurant. The warm light outside the restaurant was embellished with pots of plants placed outdoors. [Li Xing] crossed the small courtyard and arrived at the entrance of the restaurant.
1:33:31|1:33:40|He looked around through the glass door, [He Qiaoqiao] was busy at the bar. He pushed the door open, the sound catching [He Qiaoqiao]'s attention as she looked towards the entrance.
1:33:45|1:33:58|[Li Xing] withdrew his gaze at the words, taking in everything in the restaurant. The walls were covered with porcelain made by [He Qiaoqiao], ranging from plates to jars. [Li Xing] was stunned by the scene before him.
1:33:58|1:34:6|He Qiaoqiao looked at Li Xing with some confusion, holding two sets of bowls and chopsticks as she walked slowly to Li Xing's side. Li Xing looked at her with a touch of heartache.
1:34:6|1:34:14|The once lively girl, now weakened by illness, [He Qiaoqiao] sets down her chopsticks.
1:34:15|1:34:20|Looking at the dishes in front of her, [He Qiaoqiao] said:
1:34:24|1:34:50|[Li Xing] smiled after listening, picked up the chopsticks, lifted the bowl, picked up a piece of meat from the plate and put it in his mouth to savor. Looking at him, [He Qiaoqiao] asked with some anticipation, [Li Xing] nodded happily, [He Qiaoqiao] smiled a bit more on her face after listening, while [Li Xing] listened quietly.
1:34:52|1:34:56|[Li Xing] looked at the food in the bowl and chuckled, not responding to the other person's question.
1:35:4|1:35:11|Sensing the upcoming topic, [Li Xing] froze in expression.
1:35:45|1:35:54|[He Qiaoqiao] looked at the old photo and fell into memories.
1:36:38|1:36:44|[Li Xing] held back tears and asked with a trembling voice:
1:37:0|1:37:8|Li Xing, who learned the truth, cried like a child.
1:37:10|1:37:34|[Li Xing] tried hard to control his emotions. [He Qiaoqiao] approached [Li Xing] with a smile on her face, gently lifting the corners of his mouth with her index finger to make him smile.
1:37:37|1:37:46|[Li Xing] couldn't imagine [He Qiaoqiao] leaving like this, with a tumultuous heart but tears silently flowing down her face.
1:38:6|1:38:32|In the play, the often depicted separation and reunion now appear in person, in front of their eyes. All emotions converge into a silent embrace. Love and parting have always been poignant in this world. Perhaps fate is cruel to them. Since the day he met He Qiaoqiao, Li Xing fell in love at first sight. They met and fell in love in their youth.
1:38:39|1:39:8|However, before Li Xing could wait for the day when everyone's hair turned white, the beauty had already met an untimely end, like flowers fading with the wind. Six months later, Li Xing took over the Red Leaf Restaurant, filled with everything related to him and He Qiaoqiao. The plates she made by hand, the collected trinkets, and the wedding photos of the two were all neatly arranged by Li Xing. At this time, He Qiaoqiao had already left, and Li Xing, wearing a sweater, was reading a book at the bar.
1:39:8|1:39:20|And at this moment, a guest happened to push the door open.
