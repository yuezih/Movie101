0:1:45|0:1:56|Above the Nine Heavens, a building resembling a giant lotus flower stands tall in the sea of clouds. Two celestial horses flap their wings in the air, pulling a luxurious carriage adorned with intricate carvings and embroidery.
0:1:56|0:2:3|On both sides of the street stood fairies holding lanterns, while a celestial master bowed and paid respect below the stage, as the Clear Immortal Sect's Lian spoke.
0:2:27|0:2:41|The Heavenly Emperor smiled faintly, lowered the sedan curtain. The celestial horse soared into the sky and disappeared in an instant. Below the thick clouds, lies the border city of Hudu in the prosperous Tang Dynasty in the west. Outside the city, fields of wheat stretch for miles.
0:2:41|0:2:47|The sky was overcast, and crows were cawing on the scarecrow's shoulder.
0:2:47|0:2:55|Suddenly, a crow flew up and circled low in the sky. The farmer who was busy cutting wheat seemed to have sensed something, and looked back fearfully.
0:3:2|0:3:6|The old man next to him was knocked down by the monster as soon as he looked up.
0:3:6|0:3:10|A long claw reached out to his chest and sucked away his sheep soul.
0:3:10|0:3:15|In the wheat field appeared dozens of tall, human-shaped monsters with long front claws - Mountain Sweep.
0:3:15|0:3:21|After a few steps, [Xue Qing] caught up with the panicked farmers and used its sharp claws to tear open their bellies.
0:3:22|0:3:42|In the realm of demons, magma flows everywhere, black clouds gather above a group of fiery mountains, on a stone platform resembling a tree crown, there is an open treasure chest emitting faint rays of light. Outside the cave is a suspended bridge, where a dozen or so people in cloaks are holding lamb souls resembling fire seeds, lining up to cross the bridge.
0:3:43|0:3:52|A man with empty hands quietly followed at the end of the team, this person is [Zhong Kui], with thick black eyebrows, round eyes, and a full beard on his face.
0:3:52|0:4:4|He looked around vigilantly, under the bridge was a deep pit illuminated by firelight, with boiling magma at the bottom. There were several mountain monkeys climbing up the stone pillars and cliffs under the bridge, as the team ascended the towering hill.
0:4:5|0:4:10|The gatekeeper is a three-eyed mountain beast, carefully observing each person in the team.
0:4:10|0:4:15|[Zhong Kui] quickly caught up with the team and walked into the cave where the treasure box was placed, bowing his head.
0:4:15|0:4:23|People in cloaks put the sheep souls in their hands into the treasure box one by one, and the demon spirits in the box instantly absorb the sheep souls.
0:4:23|0:4:26|The guard at Three-Eyed Mountain lookout, completely unaware of the presence of outsiders in the team.
0:4:26|0:4:31|[Zhong Kui] walked pretentiously to the treasure chest, and he saw the demon's eyes widen in surprise.
0:4:32|0:4:42|[Zhang Daoxian] looked around and saw no one behind him. He immediately placed the night pearl in his hand on the stone platform, and then tucked the treasure box into his arms, running along the way.
0:4:42|0:4:50|[Zhong Kui] walked out of the cave, looking at the [Three-eyed Monster] with its back to him, carefully crouching and crawling under the legs of the [Three-eyed Monster].
0:4:50|0:4:55|[San Yanshan] the grass still growled low, looking around without noticing anything.
0:4:55|0:4:59|[Zhong Kui] held his breath as he passed through the crowd outside the cave, only to be noticed by a giant lizard.
0:5:0|0:5:9|The giant lizard spread out the scattered membrane around its neck and crawled towards [Zhong Kui]. [Zhong Kui] passed through the crowd and suddenly spat out a silk thread to pull off the cloak on [Zhong Kui]'s body.
0:5:9|0:5:32|[Zhong Kui] exposed the treasure box, he turned around in horror, the cloak monsters turned into lava-like mountain demons and rushed towards him. [Zhang Daoxian] who was waiting outside the demon realm immediately sensed the danger. [Zhong Kui] ran frantically on the stone bridge with the treasure box in his left hand, while the [Three-eyed Mountain Demon] behind him pushed aside the obstructing little demons and pounced on him. [Zhang Daoxian] shot out a beam of light from his hand.
0:5:32|0:5:48|The beam of light passed through the hole and wrapped around [Zhong Kui], lifting him into the air. The giant claws of [Three-Eyed Hanging] scraped across [Zhong Kui]'s chest. [Zhong Kui] was pulled back to [Zhang Daoxian]'s side by the beam of light. Xi Yi looked up and stood up, transforming into a stunning beauty.
0:5:48|0:6:2|Zhang Daoxian felt relieved as he touched the treasure box. Xue Qing rushed to the edge of the drawbridge, only to see two dots of light flying towards the sky, drawing an arc of light in the horizon. He quickly flew back to the solitary mountain where the lava flows converged, and entered a frozen cave.
0:6:7|0:6:23|The ice layer in the cave cracked slightly, and on the rocky mountain surrounded by conglomerate, the Dragon Throne was placed conspicuously. A black mist descended from the sky, with [Demon King] sitting steadily on the throne, holding a short knife in hand, ready to attack the precious land of Danxi.
0:6:23|0:6:24|The Demon King reached out and sucked away the short sword.
0:6:43|0:6:47|[The Demon King] raised his hand to reject the request of the Lizard Spirit, and instead turned to look at the frozen cave behind him.
0:6:56|0:7:12|The palm of [Demon King] emitted a blazing fire that instantly melted the ice layer, revealing a frosty beauty lying among thousands of ice spikes in the cave. She was dressed in a long dress with repeated patterns, her eyebrows and eyes mossy, displaying a cold and stunningly beautiful face.
0:7:12|0:7:17|The title appears, [Zhong Kui] Demon Slayer, [Xue Qing] Demon Spirit.
0:7:17|0:7:20|The city of Hu Du is bustling, with pedestrians crowding the streets.
0:7:25|0:7:36|In the crowd, a cloth banner suddenly rose, with the words "Protect Poling" written on it. [Du Ping] held the banner high, shouting as he walked in circles among the crowd, and the pedestrians quickly made way for him.
0:7:59|0:8:1|A chubby man walked forward.
0:8:20|0:8:24|[Du Ping] took a package of medicine handed to him by someone nearby.
0:8:24|0:8:28|The burly man behind Du Ping suddenly spoke.
0:8:51|0:8:59|The big man called over a woman with an impressive figure, and [Du Ping] frowned when he saw her.
0:8:59|0:9:4|[Du Ping] patted the big man.
0:9:4|0:9:8|[Du Ping] tried to escape, but was grabbed by Brother Xiong.
0:9:8|0:9:14|Xue Qing's wife took the initiative to reach out her wrist, but [Du Ping] reached out and touched Xue Qing's body, which made him unhappy.
0:9:17|0:9:37|[Du Ping] suddenly grabbed Bear Brother's lower body, and Bear Brother closed his eyes and endured it.
0:9:37|0:9:40|Xiong Ge chased after [Du Ping], but was blocked by a woman.
0:10:5|0:10:24|[Zhong Ling], [Du Ping], and Xiao Wei ran back to the mansion together. The mansion of the Zhong family had a grand gate and courtyard, with several wooden dummies for martial arts practice. In his dream, [Zhong Kui] muttered to himself.
0:10:24|0:10:27|[Zhang Daoxian] suddenly appeared.
0:10:35|0:10:37|[Zhang Daoxian] lowered his eyes.
0:11:28|0:11:34|[Zhang Daoxian] is all smiles, but [Zhong Ling] furrows her brow with worry, as the thousand-foot white painting points up into the clouds, reaching all the way to the heavens.
0:11:34|0:11:44|At the top of the canopy, a fairy pavilion suddenly appeared in the clouds. The trunk extended into mid-air islands below the pavilion, and a beam of light fell on the open space in front of the pavilion.
0:11:51|0:11:56|[Zhang Daoxian] brought [Zhong Kui] to the Immortal Pavilion, where the walls were inlaid with gold, magnificent and grand.
0:11:56|0:12:0|[Zhang Daoxian] looked at the fish swimming in the well, and said, lifting his head.
0:12:19|0:12:26|The thunder roared, the scene shifted back to a year ago, the door was kicked open, [Zhong Kui] and a few demon slayers burst in.
0:12:26|0:12:30|A pregnant woman in labor struggles on the bed, suddenly sits up and roars.
0:12:32|0:12:39|The demon slayer stepped forward as ordered, but was knocked down by the pregnant woman with a slap. The others rushed up and managed to temporarily restrain her.
0:12:39|0:12:48|Outside the door, the Green Dragon women gathered around at the sound, [Zhong Kui] looked at the woman on the bed who was raging like a wild beast, and sprinkled a handful of soybeans on her.
0:12:48|0:12:53|The pregnant woman's body touched the soybeans and emitted bursts of smoke, she trembled and gradually calmed down.
0:12:55|0:12:58|The lips of the parturient turned pale, gasping heavily.
0:12:58|0:13:7|Outside the door, the women listened to the commotion. [Zhong Kui] was half-kneeling in front of the pregnant woman, stroking her belly, which suddenly became uneven.
0:13:7|0:13:12|[Zhang Daoxian] looked at the pregnant woman calmly, her face covered in sweat, her expression much gentler.
0:13:13|0:13:19|She looked up at her belly, then slowly shifted her gaze to [Zhong Kui]'s face.
0:13:19|0:13:23|[Zhong Kui] grinned, and the pregnant woman also revealed a gentle smile.
0:13:23|0:13:29|[Zhang Daoxian] wrinkled his nose like teasing a cat, and the pregnant woman unexpectedly stuck out her tongue and licked her lips in a circle.
0:13:29|0:13:34|The pregnant woman with long fangs opened her mouth and pounced on [Zhong Kui], with nine tiger tails emerging from under her body.
0:13:34|0:13:48|The nine-tailed fox revealed its true form and bit [Zhong Kui]'s sword. The pregnant woman fainted on the bed. [Zhong Kui] drew his sword and chopped off the fox's head twice, but unexpectedly, two more heads grew out from the wound, with the middle head knocking [Zhong Kui]'s sword down.
0:13:48|0:13:57|Just as she was about to jump, [Zhong Kui] kicked her into the wooden cabinet against the wall. She used the "exposing the waist" move to knock down the cabinet lid on the nine-tailed fox, but the fox inside the cabinet caused chaos in the room.
0:13:58|0:14:9|Zhong Ling stepped on the wooden cabinet and stabilized it. He held the sword with both hands above the cabinet, closed his eyes, and focused on sensing the movement of the Nine-Tailed Fox. His face and the blade of the sword were covered in flowing blood.
0:14:9|0:14:12|Suddenly, Zhong Ling thrust the sword down, and the cabinet split into four or five pieces with a loud noise.
0:14:13|0:14:17|The Nine-Tailed Fox leaped up, but its tail was pinned to the ground by a sword.
0:14:17|0:14:30|Zhang Yaoshi quickly stepped forward to hold down the sword, jumping up to cut off the tail of the Nine-Tailed Fox. [Zhong Kui] picked up the sword on the ground, walked to the front of the Nine-Tailed Fox with a wicked smile, and chopped off the three fox heads with a single stroke.
0:14:30|0:14:40|The door opens, and the heavily made-up women at the door scatter in all directions. [Zhong Kui], covered in blood but unscathed, strides out with a sword in one hand and a fox tail in the other.
0:14:40|0:14:42|The flashback ends, [Zhang Daoxian] instructs [Zhong Ling].
0:14:53|0:14:59|Zhong Kuai hurriedly knelt down, and [Zhang Daoxian] took out a carved magic fan from his wide sleeve.
0:15:4|0:15:11|Zhong Kui quickly reached out his hand, and [Zhang Daoxian] opened the magic fan. The fan bones were sharp, and the fan surface looked like clouds and mist.
0:15:29|0:15:33|[Zhang Daoxian] used the magic fan to create a cut in [Zhong Kui]'s hand.
0:15:33|0:15:41|[Zhang Daoxian] unfolds the magic fan, with [Zhong Kui] holding his palm facing down, dripping his blood evenly on the surface of the fan, a force bursting out within [Zhong Kui].
0:15:47|0:15:53|His body gradually expanded, turning into a black giant with muscles like molten lava.
0:15:53|0:15:58|His armor-like skin is covered with cracks, through which ancient magma flows.
0:15:58|0:16:6|[Zhong Kui] stood on a lotus bamboo platform nearly three times the height of a person, dazedly in front of [Zhang Daoxian], observing his new body.
0:16:15|0:16:23|[Zhong Kui] had two inverted hooks growing at his ankles, and he staggered over to the nearby fish tank and bent down to take a look.
0:16:23|0:16:29|In the reflection, Xue Qing's face was dark, with three dazzling cracks on her forehead, like a demon.
0:16:29|0:16:38|He was scared to the ground, then flipped and stood up, leaped several yards high out of nowhere, and awkwardly fell heavily in a strange posture.
0:16:38|0:16:40|[Zhang Daoxian] walked slowly to his side when he saw the situation.
0:16:44|0:16:49|[Zhong Kui] immediately bounced up, collided with the door frame, and then fled in a panic regardless of the pain.
0:17:9|0:17:15|Through the dust and fog, the continuous mountains can be seen. [Zhong Kui] is climbing on the steep cliff, almost falling.
0:17:15|0:17:20|Soon, he agilely climbed and jumped on the cliff like a monkey in the mountains.
0:17:28|0:17:34|[Zhong Kui] climbed along the dangerous cliff to the edge of the cliff, then turned around and leaped to stand firmly on the hanging stone at the edge of the cliff.
0:17:38|0:17:42|He looked down at the valley from here, taking in the beautiful scenery.
0:17:42|0:17:47|[Zhong Kui] is leaping and jumping in the tea garden, and several wild rabbits are hidden under the lush tea bushes.
0:17:47|0:17:54|He scattered flowers in the air, spinning and landing, causing the wild rabbits to scatter like splashing water.
0:17:54|0:17:59|[Zhong Kui] came to the waterfall in the mountains and leaped onto the abrupt cliff stone at the mouth of the waterfall.
0:18:0|0:18:9|He leaped around the rushing waterfall like a child, in the blink of an eye, he jumped onto a cliff twice as high, as light as a feather.
0:18:9|0:18:16|The scenery here is unique, with towering mountains competing against each other. On a solitary peak, large and small, the summit is a flat land.
0:18:16|0:18:23|[Zhong Kui] has transformed back into human form and is practicing at the peak. He blows off the sand and stones in his palm, then performs a low sweep kick.
0:18:36|0:18:41|Daoxian Zhang opened the iron fan, and [Zhong Kui] transformed into a black giant, charging towards the huge rock at the edge of the cliff.
0:18:41|0:18:46|He smashed the side of the boulder with a flying punch, and after a few more punches, most of the boulder was smashed off.
0:18:49|0:18:54|He caught the fan thrown by Zhang Daoxian, and it transformed back to its original form with a spark.
