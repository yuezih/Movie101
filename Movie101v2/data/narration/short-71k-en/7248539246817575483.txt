0:0:21|0:0:30|In the misty morning, a galloping horse approached swiftly. [Yanzi Li San], dressed in night clothes, threw the small cloth bag in his hand to the ground before quickly turning and leaving.
0:0:30|0:0:34|The raggedly dressed child quickly ran over and picked it up.
0:0:55|0:0:58|The poor people flooded the streets, grateful for the hero's generous donation.
0:0:58|0:1:5|Suddenly the sky darkened, and a masked man rode up to the outside of a courtyard. With a sudden leap, he flew into the courtyard.
0:1:21|0:1:24|Upon hearing the shout, the masked man retreated and entered through the door.
0:1:24|0:1:29|In the room, He Laoda is bullying a young girl. Seeing this, the masked person loudly threatens.
0:1:29|0:1:36|Boss He stood up immediately upon seeing the masked man.
0:1:36|0:1:38|Boss He immediately pushed the girl towards [Yanzi Li San].
0:1:42|0:1:49|Seeing the other party trying to escape towards the door, [Yanzi Li San] nodded to the good girl and chased after, kicking He Laoda down with one foot.
0:1:49|0:1:52|The girl in the room saw the sachet dropped by [Yanzi Li San] and fell into contemplation.
0:1:52|0:1:56|The guards outside the door rushed in, but were all knocked down by [Yanzi Li San].
0:1:56|0:1:57|Later, [Yanzi Li San] found Boss He.
0:2:13|0:2:19|[Yanzi Li San] stepped on He Laoda's chest, causing him to immediately feel a sharp pain and spit out blood.
0:2:19|0:2:27|In the quiet moonlight, a brush lightly dances on the wall, and slowly, the image of a swallow emerges.
0:2:27|0:2:30|The film "Master Thief [Yanzi Li San]" appears on the screen.
0:2:38|0:2:53|Four guards swung their big knives towards [Yanzi Li San], striking fiercely. Their attacks were fast and ruthless. He threw a punch, striking towards his opponent, blocking the first two knives. Before he could react, the other two guards attacked from behind, aiming at his face. Seizing the opportunity, he leaped like a flying bird, dodging the blades.
0:2:53|0:2:56|After creating some distance from the opponent, [Yanzi Li San] displayed his lightness skill and charged towards the isolated thug.
0:2:57|0:3:7|With a leg sweep, like a heavy whip strike, directly hitting the opponent's chest, each strike more powerful than the last, as hard as steel, forcing the opponent to step back continuously.
0:3:7|0:3:16|The opponent, Yanzi Li San, who had been knocked down several times, gradually couldn't keep up with the defense, retreated, until he was hit again by his flying kick, his body flew backwards and directly crashed into a row of bamboo poles behind him.
0:3:16|0:3:21|At this moment, a thug ran out from the backyard and, seeing his companion on the ground, immediately charged towards [Yanzi Li San].
0:3:22|0:3:31|The two of them maintained a tacit understanding as they distanced themselves, disdainful of the leg techniques. [Yanzi Li San] continuously changed angles, countering the opponent's moves until finding an opening, then kicked heavily towards the opponent's foot.
0:3:36|0:3:40|Seeing the thug rushing towards her, [Yanzi Li San] immediately dodged to avoid his attack.
0:3:40|0:3:48|The left foot fiercely kicked towards the opponent's attacking right foot. The thug couldn't dodge in time and was kicked in the chest by [Yanzi Li San]'s straight leg, causing him to be knocked over due to the shift in weight.
0:3:48|0:3:54|Seeing the situation was not good, Yanzi Li San immediately rolled to the scattered bamboo poles and picked one up as a weapon.
0:4:0|0:4:6|Upon hearing this, the thug's face instantly turned fierce, rushing forward immediately as the two engaged in a fierce fight.
0:4:6|0:4:12|[Yanzi Li San] swiftly dodges the opponent's attacks using body movements and techniques, while launching sharp counterattacks.
0:4:12|0:4:17|His figure moved like a swallow, swiftly shuttling between the attacks of his opponents, constantly searching for openings.
0:4:17|0:4:23|The thug, taking advantage of the longer bamboo stick, kept striking fiercely at the legs of [Yanzi Li San], attempting to knock down the opponent in this way.
0:4:24|0:4:29|[Yanzi Li San], under the fierce attack of the thugs, unwilling to show weakness, picked up a big knife and chopped towards the thug's waist.
0:4:29|0:4:34|The thug quickly reacted, dodging [Yanzi Li San]'s deadly blow with a swift turn.
0:4:34|0:4:43|In the midst of the ordinary back-and-forth, the henchmen had no chance to approach [Yanzi Li San]. Instead, the weapon, a bamboo pole, which gained an advantage halfway through, was cut in half by [Yanzi Li San]'s broadsword with a loud crack.
0:4:46|0:4:54|His eyes flashed with ferocity, gritting his teeth, tightly gripping the bamboo pole, he shouted loudly and charged towards [Yanzi Li San] once again.
0:4:54|0:4:59|The two of them wrestled again, the big knife and the bamboo stick constantly making clashing sounds.
0:4:59|0:5:2|On this cold and quiet night, it seemed particularly harsh.
0:5:2|0:5:10|In several rounds of fighting, the movements of the thug became slow due to exhaustion, clearly unable to withstand the increasingly fierce attacks from [Yanzi Li San].
0:5:11|0:5:17|[Yanzi Li San] took advantage of the thug's distraction, quickly circled behind him, raised a big knife, and chopped towards his back.
0:5:17|0:5:22|The thug's coat ripped open, revealing the vest that had long been soaked with sweat.
0:5:22|0:5:28|At this moment, [Yanzi Li San], who had the upper hand, did not let his guard down against his opponent who had been slashed, and continued to press the attack.
0:5:28|0:5:35|The old man hiding outside the door, his hand gripping the door frame tightly, nervously and anxiously watching the fight inside the courtyard.
0:5:35|0:5:41|[Yanzi Li San]'s agile swordsmanship picked out multiple holes in the opponent's outer garment, enraging the thug who immediately pounced.
0:5:41|0:5:50|Just as the two were fighting fiercely, a person sneaked out from the backyard, hugging a package. Afraid of being discovered by [Yanzi Li San], the person tiptoed along the wall towards the door.
0:5:51|0:5:57|[Yanzi Li San] caught a glimpse of the leader of the Black Gang with the corner of his eye, afraid that the opponent might escape, so he immediately accelerated his attack on the henchmen who were obstructing him.
0:5:57|0:6:6|After rising and spinning with a double kick, Yanzi Li San then leaps into the air for a 360-degree spin kick, directly knocking the attacker to the ground, leaving them unable to get up.
0:6:6|0:6:13|[Yanzi Li San] kicked him to the ground and then kicked the silver notes in his hand into the fire.
0:6:13|0:6:16|The boss in black ran into the headlight of [Yanzi Li San] head-on and immediately kept backing away.
0:6:23|0:6:35|The henchman who was just knocked down heard the instructions from the boss and immediately got up to run towards the main house to unlock the chains.
0:6:43|0:6:57|The ragged old man embraced his granddaughter and came to [Yanzi Li San].
0:6:57|0:7:4|On the road outside the river, people hurriedly rushed, the refugees and the injured soldiers sitting in the carriage moved forward difficultly.
0:7:4|0:7:10|A soldier with a wounded right leg, using crutches, is moving along with the crowd when suddenly, the soldier is tripped and falls to the ground.
0:7:33|0:7:43|Seeing the pedestrians indifferent, Yanzi Li San had to search on himself, only to find nothing. He then gave his only crutch to the old man.
0:7:47|0:7:54|The soldier with a missing leg forcefully shoved a crutch into the hands of the old man, a scene observed by the young man dressed in magnificent attire riding a spirited horse.
0:7:54|0:8:2|After the soldier with a missing leg left, the young man took out a bag of silver from his arms, threw it next to the old man, and rode away on his horse.
0:8:2|0:8:9|In the noisy street, the young man who had just done a good deed was handing out candies to the children. Beside him, Yanzi Li San was pushed and bumped into the young man.
0:8:11|0:8:21|He stopped the little beggar and the other person nervously turned around.
0:8:21|0:8:27|The young beggar watched him walk away, took out the money bag to check, only to pour out a pile of stones.
0:8:27|0:8:31|The little beggar turned around and saw that the bag of real money was actually in the hands of the young man.
0:8:39|0:8:43|The young beggar looked around but didn't see the young man's figure.
0:8:43|0:8:45|In the market, the soldier with a limp hands over the gun.
0:8:58|0:9:1|Seeing the other party's attitude, [Yanzi Li San] had no choice but to kneel down.
0:9:20|0:9:23|The human trafficker contemptuously flicked away the cigarette butt and walked away.
0:9:23|0:9:28|At this moment, Yanzi Li San walked out from the crowd and spoke slowly.
0:9:28|0:9:30|Upon hearing someone speak, [Yanzi Li San] looked towards the speaker.
0:9:30|0:9:32|Yanzi Li San looked up and the young man angrily shouted.
0:9:36|0:9:37|Yanzi Li San choked up and replied.
0:9:41|0:9:45|The young man threw the money bag in front of [Yanzi Li San], and [Yanzi Li San] slowly picked up the money bag.
0:9:51|0:9:52|After speaking, the young man turned and left.
0:9:52|0:9:54|After speaking, Yanzi Li San turned around and left.
0:9:54|0:9:55|After speaking, Yanzi Li San turned around and left.
0:10:17|0:10:19|A man enters the restaurant.
0:10:51|0:10:58|The young man was reciting poetry to himself.
0:10:58|0:11:3|The man, accompanied by his subordinates, walked straight to the young man's table and sat down without waiting for an invitation.
0:11:14|0:11:16|The man looked up and asked his subordinate.
0:11:44|0:11:45|The young man lifted the palm on his shoulder.
0:12:39|0:12:46|At the urging of the shopkeeper, Yanzi Li San brought a jar of wine, and Jin Lan casually picked up the wine jar and sniffed it at the tip of his nose.
0:12:46|0:12:56|He returned to the table, picked up a match to light the bottle, the waiter understood and intended to pour the wine. At this moment, he secretly picked up a peanut, aimed at the wine jar and shot it with force. The exploding wine jar caught the attention of Yanzi Li San.
0:13:37|0:13:45|In the bustling street, a massive army marched in a grand and imposing manner, causing people to involuntarily make way to the sides, creating a passage.
0:13:45|0:13:50|The soldiers in this army are dressed in uniform military attire, with the soldiers walking silently behind, their faces devoid of any extra expression.
0:13:51|0:14:1|At the forefront of the team, a military officer in uniform rode on a tall steed, head held high, eyes fixed on the pedestrians ahead, his face exuding confidence and dignity.
0:14:1|0:14:9|Passersby on the roadside stopped one after another, watching the spectacular scene. Some people waved their hands in greeting, and the leader at the front nodded to the passersby.
0:14:15|0:14:23|The young man heard the sound of Captain Tang chasing after him, and could only helplessly run forward. Suddenly, he saw the figures of the army in front of him, and made a decision as he looked at the approaching troops.
0:14:26|0:14:36|He leaped forward and landed in the middle of the leader's horse group. Before the opponent could react, he struck the horse's hindquarters with force, causing the horse to be startled and become restless.
0:14:36|0:14:46|The street suddenly became chaotic, with people scrambling to avoid being trampled by the horses. The little boy was unfortunately pushed to the front by the horses, and [Yanzi Li San] picked him up and moved him out of the way.
0:14:51|0:14:58|The young man asked the boy to hand it over to him, then turned and left. Across the street, the little beggar took in everything, while Captain Tang hurriedly ran towards the leader.
0:14:58|0:14:59|The young man was discovered when he hid in the alley.
0:15:21|0:15:29|A group of soldiers with guns stopped at the alley entrance for a blockade, with Yanzi Li San leading the way.
0:15:29|0:15:33|Leading the way with a gun in hand, [Yanzi Li San] cautiously advances forward, followed closely by [Jin Lan].
0:15:33|0:15:35|Around the corner, a gate blocked the way for everyone.
0:15:44|0:15:50|At night, Captain Tang led a group of followers who were bowing respectfully, riding bicycles, and rushing in dust and wind.
0:16:5|0:16:12|A sedan drove up and stopped in front of the crowd. The person in the passenger seat got out and opened the back door, from which [Jin Lan] emerged.
0:16:12|0:16:16|Captain Tang quickly took off his hat and stepped forward to greet [Jin Lan].
0:16:36|0:16:39|A person suddenly jumped out in the courtyard, blocking the way of everyone.
0:16:59|0:17:9|The servant had no choice but to keep an eye on [Jin Lan].
0:17:9|0:17:17|[Jin Lan] ignored the servant who was speaking and walked towards the living room on her own. The attendant quickly wiped the dusty chair clean with his sleeve.
0:17:17|0:17:20|[Jin Lan] sat down and glanced around from time to time, looking serious.
0:17:29|0:17:35|The servant nervously glanced at the plaque above the living room, which read "Knowledge brings joy".
0:17:50|0:17:54|After confirming that Lady [Jin Lan] had left, Madam spoke slowly.
0:18:3|0:18:6|The young man gently placed the plaque on the ground and peeked out.
0:18:6|0:18:11|The young man saw Yanzi Li San make a move, so he used a plaque to defend himself and took the opportunity to kick the opponent's chest hard.
0:18:11|0:18:16|Zhang Lu kept retreating, seeing the young man preparing to launch another attack, the young man immediately raised the plaque above his head.
0:18:16|0:18:21|The young man pretended to smash the plaque to scare the other person after finding out their weak spot.
0:18:21|0:18:27|Seeing Zhang Lu dare not act rashly, Yanzi Li San threw the plaque on the ground and slid towards the door with his feet on the plaque.
0:18:28|0:18:32|Hai Bian was kicked back into the hands of Zhang Lu by Yanzi Li San.
0:18:32|0:18:36|Yanzi Li San disappeared into the night after listening to the incantation three times.
0:18:36|0:18:41|In a large courtyard, the actors are performing on stage, and the audience is also excited.
0:18:41|0:18:45|The guests went to respectfully greet the old man sitting in the middle.
0:18:48|0:18:56|Captain Tang shuttles through the lively banquet with a serious expression, vigilantly looking around and occasionally engaging in brief conversations with the guests.
0:18:56|0:19:5|He walked towards the bottom of the West Terrace, trying to find suspicious traces, observing the expressions and actions of everyone.
0:19:5|0:19:10|After making sure there was no danger, Yanzi Li San turned around and walked towards a group of followers, who quickly approached him.
0:19:48|0:19:51|Zhang Lu respectfully presented the gift after hearing it.
0:20:5|0:20:7|After finishing reading, [Yanzi Li San] looked up in surprise.
0:20:7|0:20:8|Young Master awkwardly wiped the sweat off his forehead.
0:20:52|0:20:57|Yanzi Li San directly refused, and Zhang Lu accepted the returned gift.
0:20:57|0:20:59|A guest entered from outside the door.
0:21:19|0:21:24|Upon seeing the gift from Xiaoliyuan, Commander Ma was momentarily stunned.
0:21:24|0:21:25|Young Master is full of pride.
0:21:43|0:21:48|The maid standing aside stepped forward to receive the gift.
0:21:48|0:21:53|Xiaoliyuan learns Chinese etiquette and bows in return.
0:21:53|0:22:0|Only the young master is in the room without a seat.
0:22:0|0:22:6|Commander Ma held an invitation card, but couldn't remember if he knew this person.
0:22:6|0:22:9|A young man in a suit swaggered in.
0:23:43|0:23:47|After the young man greeted the commander with a fake name, he pretended to stroll around in the audience, but in fact, he was observing the layout of the courtyard.
0:24:11|0:24:18|He found the courtyard seemingly lively, but actually heavily guarded, with Tang Captain's followers and the Young Marshal's men in every corner.
0:24:18|0:24:31|On stage, Yanzi Li San, dressed as a beautiful huadan, wearing a flower crown and gorgeous costume, holding a short spear, and wearing embroidered shoes, gracefully covered the short spear in her hand, her colorful steps synchronized with the music of Peking Opera.
0:24:31|0:24:39|He spins around for a while, then performs various movements, even the posture when he stops is exquisite, which earns continuous applause from the audience.
0:24:39|0:24:47|The young man was attracted by the girl on the stage, but soon he recognized her, the leading actress was the girl he saved from Boss He.
0:24:47|0:24:55|Seeing the other party safe and sound, Yanzi Li San turned and walked towards the audience, when Jin Lan suddenly appeared right in front of him.
0:24:55|0:25:3|Yu Guang caught a glimpse of Captain Tang walking towards the crowd, so he had to turn around and leave immediately. Captain Tang then walked towards the mesmerized Young Marshal in the audience.
0:25:3|0:25:6|Yanzi Li San is attracted by the actress on stage, and Captain Tang speaks up.
0:25:23|0:25:31|The young man hid behind a tree, avoiding the patrolling soldiers. When the soldiers moved away, he quickly leaped onto the branches, moving lightly and swiftly among them.
0:25:31|0:25:44|Shortly after, another group of soldiers patrolled by. After they left, the young man changed into the night clothes hidden in the tree, his face wrapped in cloth, only revealing a pair of eyes. He jumped off the tree trunk and quietly followed the soldiers to a small house in the backyard.
0:25:45|0:26:2|He held his breath, staring at [Yanzi Li San]. With the protection of the soldiers, the young man unlocked the door skillfully, his movements unnoticed by the guard at the door. Once inside the room, the young man quickly leaped onto the roof, gently pushing aside the tiles to reveal the scene inside the house.
0:26:2|0:26:11|Xiaoshuai opened the mechanism on the wall and entered another room. His vision was blocked, but he did not see that behind the calligraphy and painting hanging on the wall, there was another secret room.
0:26:11|0:26:20|After Xiaoshuai left with the box, Yanzi Li San quickly jumped into the house, found the secret compartment, pushed aside the shelves, entered the secret room, and put the valuable items into the package.
0:26:20|0:26:22|He operated carefully, afraid of alerting others.
0:26:24|0:26:30|In the living room, Yanzi Li San brought the treasure back to the main house, and everyone gathered around to take a look.
0:26:35|0:26:46|After Young Master Chao Pu showed off, he rolled up his sleeves, gently revealed the treasure wrapped in Hanoi cloth, slowly untied the small knots on top, and then presented the precious jade to everyone.
0:27:5|0:27:16|A young man carrying a package full of treasures came out from the second floor of the treasure trove, then displayed his light skills to leap down. Just as he landed softly and was about to leave, a group of soldiers rushed out from the nearby hut.
0:27:36|0:27:50|The young man made a handcuffed posture, and the follower tried to take him down but was thrown down by him. His companion immediately fired a gun, and the young man seized the opponent's gun, pulled the trigger, and the soldier who reacted slowly was hit.
0:27:54|0:27:58|In the reception room, after instructing someone to protect her father, [Yanzi Li San] hurries towards the treasure trove.
0:27:58|0:28:5|Here, after running out of bullets, Captain Tang rushed towards Yanzi Li San trying to catch him barehanded, but Yanzi Li San skillfully countered each move.
0:28:5|0:28:9|The onlookers, seeing that both Yanzi Li San and Jin Lan were equally skilled, did not dare to step forward to help.
0:28:10|0:28:13|They had to stand in a wall-like formation, blocking the young man's way out.
0:28:15|0:28:17|The young man used his skilled leg technique to kick down Captain Tang.
0:28:17|0:28:22|After the opponent fell to the ground, Yanzi Li San immediately grabbed the young man's legs and pulled hard.
0:28:22|0:28:24|The young man fell to the ground because of unstable gravity.
0:28:24|0:28:27|After realizing what was happening, [Yanzi Li San] immediately flipped over and leaped up by inertia.
0:28:27|0:28:32|Seeing their leader being knocked down to the ground, [Yanzi Li San] bravely charged towards the young man, despite the outnumbered opponents.
0:28:32|0:28:37|The young man immediately changed tactics, pulling up the fallen Captain Tang and pointing the gun at the opponent's forehead.
0:28:47|0:28:57|Upon hearing Captain Tang's command, everyone had to cover their heads and crouch down, while Yanzi Li San quickly jumped out of the courtyard.
0:28:57|0:29:0|After the attendant finished speaking, [Captain Tang] slowly looked back to confirm that the young man had left.
0:29:14|0:29:25|Not far away, [Yanzi Li San] ran over with a group of soldiers.
0:29:25|0:29:31|Captain Tang led his men to chase outside, but no one noticed that there was a figure behind the tree in the courtyard.
0:29:31|0:29:36|As the group walked away, Xiao Hu flew out from behind the tree and landed on the roof, just happened to be seen by the servant.
0:29:48|0:29:53|After the followers chasing Yanzi Li San and Jin Lan left the house, the young man inside jumped out of the window.
0:29:53|0:30:3|[Yanzi Li San] saw the masked intruder and immediately shouted, while the young man covered her mouth.
0:30:3|0:30:8|[Yanzi Li San] calmed down.
0:30:40|0:30:46|Captain Tang rudely pushed aside Yanzi Li San who was blocking the entrance with her crutch, and went in to take a look after opening the gap.
0:30:46|0:30:54|[Yanzi Li San] followed closely, with [Captain Tang] standing in the middle, carefully scanning around but finding no clues, then apologizing.
0:30:54|0:30:56|After failing to find the person, Yanzi Li San turned around and left.
0:30:56|0:30:59|Captain Tang left, and the attendant conscientiously closed the door.
0:30:59|0:31:3|After confirming that the other party had left, Luoxia turned and walked towards the costumes.
0:31:3|0:31:6|She peeled off the heavy costume, searching for the young man's figure.
0:31:6|0:31:8|The young man hiding on the beam jumped behind [Yanzi Li San].
0:31:30|0:31:33|After the young man nodded in agreement, he walked out.
0:31:33|0:31:39|In the courtyard, under the watchful eyes of soldiers with guns in two rows, the master of the opera troupe carried props and walked towards the door.
0:31:39|0:31:41|The young man blends in.
0:32:0|0:32:18|Captain Tang walked up to the young man who was tidying up the props with his head down. The young man slowly turned his head and met Captain Tang's eyes. Without waiting for any objections, the young man knocked Captain Tang to the ground in one swift motion. Then, using the force of a bamboo pole, he sent himself out of the courtyard, while the followers shot but did not hit the young man.
0:32:18|0:32:29|The young man fled to the main street, hiding under the archway. The noise of the pursuers woke up a little beggar sleeping on the street. Seeing the pursuers getting closer, the young man had no choice but to climb up the archway to hide. Hurry!
0:33:0|0:33:1|The little beggar saw the pursuers go far away.
0:33:3|0:33:22|Seeing the opponent's excellent martial arts skills, Yanzi Li San quickly approached to inquire. The two walked in the opposite direction of the pursuers, with the beggar leading the way with the young man, unaware of a basin of water falling down.
0:33:33|0:33:47|The shopkeeper became excited when he saw Yanzi Li San, and laboriously moved his lame leg closer to him.
0:33:53|0:33:55|The young man helped up the kneeling Yanzi Li San.
0:34:3|0:34:5|The young beggar suddenly knelt down in front of [Yanzi Li San].
0:34:47|0:34:51|[Yanzi Li San] pondered for a moment, then spoke slowly.
0:34:51|0:34:52|[Yanzi Li San] used both hands and feet to climb over the wall.
0:35:14|0:35:17|[Yanzi Li San] gazes into the distance, lost in thought.
0:35:17|0:35:22|[Jin Lan] paced back and forth with her hands on her hips. Suddenly, a sachet appeared in front of her, and she yanked it off and threw it on the ground.
0:35:22|0:35:27|The sachet was placed in front of [Yanzi Li San] by the tree.
0:35:27|0:35:28|Not long after.
0:35:53|0:35:56|Yanzi Li San's emotions drifted back to the present, looking into the distance silently.
0:35:56|0:36:8|The next day, [Yanzi Li San] arrived at Beihai Park.
0:36:8|0:36:12|[Yanzi Li San] looked towards the person who responded.
0:36:30|0:36:34|With a slight smile, [Yanzi Li San] and [Jin Lan] arrived at the lakeside.
0:37:40|0:37:45|[Yanzi Li San] came to another brothel, where several girls walked into the private room and lined up.
0:39:16|0:39:18|Yanzi Li San looked back at the girl.
0:39:51|0:39:57|Pusla grabbed Yanzi Li San's hand and walked towards the table, then picked up the box and handed it to her.
0:40:6|0:40:12|The landlady opened it, saw the jade bowl, and gave a slight snort before placing it back on the table persistently.
0:40:24|0:40:35|Lai Fu looked up and saw Luo Xia standing in the line of beggars.
0:40:35|0:40:41|He handed the bowl in his hand to [Jin Lan].
0:40:41|0:40:43|Pass the five steamed buns to Yanzi Li San quickly, buddy.
0:40:47|0:40:50|[Jin Lan] hesitated to speak, as Ichiro Kawashima arrived at the Qin Wang Mansion to pay a visit.
0:41:45|0:41:49|Upon seeing Yanzi Li San's fondness for the jade seal, Jin Lan immediately came up with an idea.
0:41:49|0:41:56|At the gate of the General's Mansion at night, a group of soldiers patrolled by. Suddenly, a figure flashed through the air and landed on the eaves of the courtyard.
0:41:56|0:42:6|Yanzi Li San, who was squatting on the tree, happened to see this. After putting on his mask, he quickly followed up and, seeing the other party stop, Yanzi Li San picked up a stone and threw it at the other person, who caught it.
0:42:6|0:42:12|After looking around, the masked man did not see the figure of [Yanzi Li San], so he threw away the stone and flew towards the treasure trove of the Grand Marshal's Mansion.
0:42:12|0:42:15|[Yanzi Li San] shook his head in resignation when he saw that the other party did not understand.
0:42:15|0:42:21|As soon as the masked man landed, he saw the door of the treasure trove suddenly opened, with dozens of guns pointing at him from inside.
0:42:21|0:42:40|He dodged the bullets and the soldiers inside the door tried to escape from the masked man, so they went out and lined up to aim and shoot. Seeing that the opponent's firepower was too strong, the masked man raised a stone slab to shoot at the soldiers. Seeing that the soldier with a gun was hit by the stone slab, the masked man prepared to leave, but was blocked by a soldier who knew kung fu. The masked man had no choice but to engage with him.
0:42:41|0:42:47|The two are evenly matched, entangled with each other, while a group of soldiers holding guns aim but dare not shoot at will.
0:42:47|0:42:56|[Yanzi Li San] took advantage of everyone's attention being drawn to the masked man, sneaked into the treasure trove alone, and arrived next to the cabinet where the precious treasures were stolen last time, opening the mural room.
0:42:57|0:43:4|[Yanzi Li San] easily dodged the mechanism and approached the table to take a look. Upon seeing the imperial seal inside, she nodded in satisfaction.
0:43:4|0:43:15|Outside, Yanzi Li San and Jin Lan are still fighting with the soldiers. Seeing both sides getting tired, Yanzi Li San kicks a soldier down, and the other soldiers on the side start shooting. Yanzi Li San quickly pulls up the soldier on the ground to shield himself from the bullets.
0:43:15|0:43:22|At this moment, [Yanzi Li San] soared out of the treasure trove, the soldiers shifted their firepower, allowing the masked man to escape, and [Jin Lan] hurriedly arrived.
0:43:41|0:43:50|The two of them moved through the narrow alleyway, when suddenly a masked person leaped in front of [Yanzi Li San], blocking the huge deer in front of them, and lunged towards [Yanzi Li San], attempting to snatch the jade seal from their hand.
0:43:50|0:43:56|[Yanzi Li San] quickly counterattacked, but the jade seal was kicked away by the masked man. Both of them jumped up at the same time, each grabbing the jade seal with one hand.
0:44:3|0:44:9|Taking advantage of the masked man's attention being drawn to the soldiers below, [Yanzi Li San] kicked him, causing him to release his bloody hand, and then swiftly flew away.
0:44:9|0:44:18|The masked man hurriedly chased after them. The two moved gracefully, like swallows darting through the forest. [Yanzi Li San]'s feet lightly touched the ground before taking off again.
0:44:18|0:44:36|The masked man's body is agile and nimble, performing twelve somersaults and twelve leaps. Following closely behind, he sees that [Yanzi Li San] is already within his attack range. The masked man slaps his left shoulder with a palm, forcing [Yanzi Li San] to stop on the tree trunk to adjust his position. The masked man then uses a spinning side kick, kicking the jade seal into the air, and both of them leap up simultaneously.
0:44:55|0:44:57|Yanzi Li San takes off the mask.
0:45:21|0:45:26|Seeing [Yanzi Li San] so determined, Zhang Lu no longer refused when faced with the jade seal in front of him.
0:45:48|0:45:52|[Yanzi Li San] pondered for a moment after hearing this, then turned around and said.
0:46:22|0:46:25|Director glared at Captain Tang with a look of shame and anger.
0:46:30|0:46:33|Puci placed the jade seal in his arms.
0:47:5|0:47:7|Ichiro Kawashima looked at the jade seal in front of him, his eyes shining.
0:47:13|0:47:25|Upon hearing Pusikai speak, Zhang Lu finally understood and glared at him angrily.
0:47:25|0:47:31|Seeing the jade seal in the hands of Yanzi Li San, Jin Lan stepped forward to snatch it, but was stopped by a warrior. She kicked the warrior away and took the jade seal.
0:47:38|0:47:52|After Changpu Temple finished speaking, Zhang Lu ran out with the jade seal. When he was about to reach the door, he was blocked by three Japanese warriors. The warriors took off their outer robes to reveal ninja costumes underneath. Before Zhang Lu could react, the warriors brandished their swords to stop him from charging towards them.
0:47:52|0:48:1|Zhang Lu, in order to protect the jade seal from being taken away, could only resist with one hand, while the ninja kept stalling for time. Unexpectedly, Zhang Lu remained in complete control despite facing many enemies alone.
0:48:1|0:48:6|After several rounds, the ninja was unexpectedly suppressed and unable to fight back. Seeing this situation, [Master Pu] had to shout out orders to [Zhi].
0:48:17|0:48:19|Zhang Luchao [Pusi] kneels down.
0:48:53|0:48:57|Seeing Yanzi Li San getting angry, Jin Lan had no choice but to endure the pain and hand the jade seal to Yanzi Li San.
0:48:57|0:49:1|Although Yanzi Li San moved slowly, she no longer resisted herself.
0:49:1|0:49:4|As the jade seal approached, [Yanzi Li San] coldly snatched it away from [Jin Lan].
0:49:9|0:49:22|Upon hearing the order from [Yanzi Li San], Zhang Lu had no choice but to comply. After bowing to [Yanzi Li San], she left the room with tears in her eyes. Ichiro Kawashima, who was standing by, remained silent as he watched everything unfold. The landlady was shocked as she once again confirmed the request made by [Yanzi Li San].
0:50:12|0:50:22|Cai Feng, who was eavesdropping next to the tent, suddenly frowned, and then Yanzi Li San replied.
0:50:31|0:50:48|Cai Feng listened to [Pus] attentively, then immediately showed an excited expression. After quickly returning to the room and closing the door, she leaned against the door panel for a moment of contemplation before walking towards the cabinet against the wall. After opening a drawer and searching carefully, she took out a handkerchief and examined it closely.
0:50:48|0:50:55|The exquisite handkerchief was embroidered with a vivid Yanzi, and Jin Lan, looking at the Yanzi on the handkerchief, couldn't help but fall into beautiful memories.
0:51:22|0:51:26|It turns out that [Caifeng] is the first love that [Yanzi Li San] has been looking for, [Jin Lan].
0:51:26|0:51:39|[Jin Lan] gently stroked the swallow on the handkerchief, slowly walked towards the table, sat down, placed the handkerchief on her chest, and a hint of sadness flashed in her eyes.
0:51:39|0:51:45|Zhang Lu was surrounded by soldiers at the gate of Prince Qing's Mansion. When Ma Yingjie arrived, he leaned against a stone pillar nervously without moving.
0:51:47|0:51:55|The soldier who heard the order reached out to subdue Yanzi Li San, but was knocked away by her with a palm strike. Seeing this, Jin Lan pulled out the pistol from his waist and aimed it at Yanzi Li San's forehead.
0:52:34|0:52:37|After Puci finished speaking, he noticed that Mayingjie was hesitating.
0:52:42|0:52:44|Ma Yingjie put away the pistol after hearing it.
0:52:53|0:52:54|Zhang Lu turned around and headed back to the mansion.
0:53:39|0:53:48|At the Fengyuelou, a row of glamorous courtesans stood in the room, each with a bright flower pinned in their coiled hair.
0:53:48|0:53:51|[Jin Lan] suddenly approached, asking in surprise.
0:54:8|0:54:13|Seeing the girls being driven out by Huwa, Jin Lan immediately came in to serve.
0:55:24|0:55:40|Upon hearing Lai Fu's voice, Huwa turned around and saw that Lai Fu had already been surrounded by Captain Tang's men. Without hesitation, she jumped up, grabbed the fence with both hands, and kicked down the two men who were rushing towards her. Seeing this, Captain Tang grabbed Huwa by the chest.
0:55:40|0:55:48|Huwa took off his hat, and his embroidered hair immediately scattered. Captain Tang withdrew his hand and saw the other party stunned. Huwa kicked the opponent in the crotch.
0:55:58|0:56:6|Huwa ran towards the corner of the street to hide, waiting for the followers to catch up. Suddenly, he launched an attack, kicking the opponent to the ground, and the other three rushed to help.
0:56:6|0:56:14|Huwa can only use her flexible body to create distance and gradually break through, but her strength is too small. She kicked the opponent's bone with one foot, tripped and injured herself.
0:56:14|0:56:17|Seeing the opportunity for the follower to catch her breath, [Yanzi Li San] immediately adjusted her tactics.
0:56:20|0:56:27|Using a shoulder throw, [Yanzi Li San] throws the nearest henchman against the bamboo pole by the wall, then wraps the belt around the henchman's feet.
0:56:27|0:56:30|With the help of the other person's strength, [Yanzi Li San] kicked down another follower who rushed forward.
0:56:30|0:56:34|Yanzi Li San temporarily distanced himself from the followers and jumped onto the triangular wheel filled with heavy objects.
0:56:34|0:56:39|Waiting for the opponent to approach, he gathered his strength and leaped up, directly sending the two people flying.
0:56:39|0:56:42|Seeing the four people on the ground, Yanzi Li San quickly got up and threw his belt at the opponent.
0:57:6|0:57:9|After listening to Pus's words, [Zhang Lu] lowered her head in contemplation.
0:57:9|0:57:12|In the Grand Marshal's Mansion, soldiers stood in formation at the entrance of the main house.
0:57:12|0:57:18|Yanzi Li San's henchmen tied [Lai Fu] to a pillar and pulled the rope forcefully.
0:57:18|0:57:21|[Lai Fu] was howling in pain as he was being strangled by a rope.
0:57:21|0:57:25|The henchman, strong and sturdy, secured the rope and then took out a nail, aiming at [Lai Fu]'s hand.
0:57:37|0:57:39|[Ma Yingjie] got up and walked towards [Lai Fu].
0:57:39|0:57:42|Yanzi Li San ignored himself, Jin Lan gestured to his men to bring a long sword.
0:58:8|0:58:12|Yanzi Li San pushes Ma Yingjie away.
0:58:12|0:58:14|Yanzi Li San pushes Jin Lan away.
0:58:14|0:58:16|Yanzi Li San pushes Jin Lan away.
0:58:16|0:58:19|[Yanzi Li San] pushes [Ma Yingjie] away.
0:58:41|0:58:48|Yanzi Li San did not harm himself just now, Jin Lan, as Captain Tang's assistant, then stepped forward to inquire.
0:59:14|0:59:16|Ma Yingjie looked at Yanzi Li San in confusion.
0:59:52|0:59:54|Captain Tang nodded in agreement.
1:0:16|1:0:22|Captain Tang could only release people with an unwilling face. When he returned home, [Luo Xia] gently helped Lai Fu bandage his wound.
1:0:22|1:0:27|Lai Fu gazed affectionately at [Luo Xia], and when she noticed, he shyly lowered his head.
1:0:31|1:0:35|Pressing her face against [Luo Xia]'s cheek, [Luo Xia]'s movements became gentler.
1:0:35|1:0:41|[Li San] who was about to come in to greet saw it, so he retreated before the two noticed.
1:0:58|1:1:1|Huwawa turned around and left.
1:1:4|1:1:7|[Luo Xia] went out to look for Hu Wa, and [Yanzi Li San] approached to inquire.
1:1:13|1:1:17|After speaking, [Yanzi Li San] turned and left. As he walked out, he bumped into [Jin Lan] waiting at the door.
1:1:20|1:1:24|After hearing this, Luoxia approached [Yanzi Li San] and spoke slowly.
1:1:53|1:1:59|Ichiro Kawashima reached out and took the box from the car, handing it to Jin Lan leaning against the door.
1:2:14|1:2:22|Just as the two were about to exchange items, a bomb blew up the goods on the truck. [Yanzi Li San] jumped out, snatched the jade seal, and kicked over the guard.
1:2:23|1:2:29|Shortly after, in another explosion, [Yanzi Li San] carried the jade seal and prepared to fly up to the city wall.
1:2:29|1:2:34|The ninja hidden in the dark suddenly appeared to block the way of Yanzi Li San, who was protecting Ichiro Kawashima.
1:2:34|1:2:44|[Yanzi Li San] was forced to flip back to his original position. Before he could react, several ninjas immediately raised their swords and charged towards him. [Jin Lan] hid behind the car, peering through the car window at the confrontation between the ninjas and [Yanzi Li San].
1:2:44|1:3:2|Meanwhile, Ichiro Kawai on the side kept wiping the cold sweat on his forehead with a handkerchief. Seeing the impressive martial arts skills of Yanzi Li San, the ninja immediately threw the prepared fire spell to the ground, and the hidden fuse was instantly ignited by the soil covering it. Li San reacted quickly, kicking the burning goods towards the ninja, while the remaining two ninjas tried to intervene.
1:3:2|1:3:6|[Yanzi Li San] was kicked to the ground by [Jin Lan] and saw the opponent all lying on the ground unable to get up.
1:3:7|1:3:26|[Yanzi Li San] leaped up and escaped onto the city wall, hiding from the scene. Seeing that [Yanzi Li San] had disappeared, Chuandao Ichiro, who was hiding behind the car, angrily rushed towards the ninja and slapped him hard.
1:3:26|1:3:29|Upon hearing the soldier's report, [Ma Yingjie] looked towards the door.
1:3:52|1:3:54|The jade seal is shattered.
1:4:19|1:4:21|Yanzi Li San under the gaze of Captain Tang.
1:4:43|1:4:46|Search the guard.
1:4:46|1:4:51|Captain Tang leads [Yanzi Li San] towards the prison cell.
1:4:51|1:4:55|Captain Tang kept glancing back at [Yanzi Li San].
1:4:55|1:5:0|The guard ran up and unlocked the door.
1:5:0|1:5:4|[Yanzi Li San] was pushed into the prison cell.
1:5:4|1:5:8|After the guard chained [Yanzi Li San]'s hands and feet, he rudely pushed him onto the bed.
1:5:17|1:5:25|If not, Captain Tang finished speaking and then turned around to leave, followed by clapping to lock the prison door.
1:5:25|1:5:31|[Yanzi Li San] looked around and then fixed his gaze on the translucent high window.
1:5:31|1:5:38|The madam of Maple Moon Pavilion came to find [Jin Lan], and saw her busy inside the room. As she approached, she realized that Jin Lan was packing her luggage.
1:5:41|1:5:49|Xiaoma walked into [Jin Lan]'s bed and slowly sat beside her. [Jin Lan] placed a piece of jewelry in Xiaoma's hand.
1:5:52|1:5:55|[Ma Dongmei] shook her head sadly.
1:6:45|1:6:50|Yanzi Li San saw Jin Lan crying and begging on her knees, and Xiaoma slowly knelt down beside Jin Lan.
1:7:37|1:7:45|Late at night, the suspicious [Yanzi Li San] suddenly opened his eyes, pondered for a moment, and walked towards the prison door to observe the situation outside through the window.
1:7:45|1:7:50|Seeing no one on patrol, [Yanzi Li San] used a bone-shrinking bow to free his hands and feet from the iron chains.
1:7:50|1:7:58|Yanzi Li San then leaped up and carefully observed near the window close to the roof, only to find the sole guard leaning against the wall fast asleep.
1:7:58|1:8:4|[Yanzi Li San] carefully crawled out of the window bars, then effortlessly climbed up the wall to the roof, escaping from the prison through the skylight.
1:8:6|1:8:9|[Yanzi Li San], dressed in night clothes, jumped into the courtyard and ran to the door of the room where the light was being extinguished.
1:8:21|1:8:28|[Yanzi Li San] did not leave after deliberately causing a commotion, but stood in the courtyard waiting for everyone to grab their weapons and surround him.
1:8:28|1:8:34|The thugs launched the attack first, and [Yanzi Li San] swiftly dodged, kicking down the thug who came at him.
1:8:34|1:8:40|The thugs kept launching attacks on [Yanzi Li San], but he effortlessly dodged almost all of them.
1:8:40|1:8:46|After the spell, [Yanzi Li San] was unscathed, as if the opponent's attacks had no effect at all.
1:8:46|1:8:55|He quickly maneuvered back and forth in front of the crowd, seizing the opportunity to strike directly at the opponents' vital points, rendering them unable to fight back, causing people to continuously fall to the ground.
1:8:55|1:8:58|One of the thugs was pushed down by [Yanzi Li San] and knocked out a tooth.
1:9:1|1:9:5|Yanzi Li San's skills are so agile that all the thugs feel powerless.
1:9:5|1:9:10|From the middle, [Yanzi Li San] successfully defeated everyone, only expending some physical energy.
1:9:10|1:9:16|He glanced at the thugs lying on the ground, turned around and left, leaving behind a scene of chaos and pain.
1:9:16|1:9:22|After leaving, [Yanzi Li San] did not go straight back to the cell, but instead showed off his light skills on the bustling street.
1:9:22|1:9:27|He deliberately jumped in front of the Huangbao car master, scaring him so much that he almost dropped the passenger.
1:9:35|1:9:37|The streets were crowded with people looking for the flying thief.
1:9:37|1:9:50|On the prison side, Captain Tang kicked open the iron gate and grabbed the guard by the collar.
1:9:50|1:9:54|Captain Tang walked towards the cell where Yanzi Li San was being held, and saw Yanzi Li San lying on the bed.
1:9:58|1:10:1|After the guard finished speaking, Captain Tang looked troubled, and Luo Xia went to the mansion to find Young Master.
1:10:25|1:10:50|After getting up from the desk, Yanzi Li San listened attentively for a moment before speaking slowly. Jin Lan turned and left after hearing Yanzi Li San's words, leaving the young marshal disappointed, who could only watch as she walked away.
1:10:59|1:11:6|[Jin Lan] was locked up by the stepmother, and her friend came to bring her food.
1:11:6|1:11:10|The girl, seeing no one responding, walked towards the inner room.
1:11:10|1:11:15|The girl suddenly stopped and saw the haggard [Jin Lan] sitting behind the door.
1:11:15|1:11:19|Seeing the other party like this, the girl shook her head helplessly and squatted down near [Jin Lan].
1:11:23|1:11:26|[Jin Lan] looked up and the girl spoke to persuade.
1:11:31|1:11:43|The soldier sealed the big bowl of [Yanzi Li San] with a label.
1:11:43|1:11:50|Autumn Moon saw a large crowd gathered at the entrance of Dawanju. Just as she was about to approach, she spotted Huwa among the crowd.
1:12:55|1:13:1|Tiger Baby was ruthlessly pushed out of the prison by Captain Tang's men, and then Captain Tang shouted at the guards.
1:13:14|1:13:21|Captain Tang walked towards the guard who had taken the bribe from Yanzi Li San as Tiger Baby left.
1:13:36|1:13:41|The drunken guard was slapped awake by Captain Tang, and seeing him sober up, Captain Tang slowly spoke.
1:13:58|1:14:1|The next day, the chieftain sent a wedding sedan to welcome [Jin Lan].
1:14:1|1:14:13|On the way back to the mansion, many passersby stopped in their tracks, gathering around to watch. Inside the sedan chair, the swaying bride, dressed in a bright wedding gown, sat upright on the stool with her face covered by a veil.
1:14:13|1:14:20|The onlookers eagerly watched the sedan chair, and as Tiger Baby walked out of the alley, he deliberately got close to the others and slyly stole the money pouch.
1:14:25|1:14:28|When leaving, Wawa deliberately shook the money bag in front of the man.
1:14:36|1:14:48|Wuwa intentionally led everyone to the front of the welcoming procession, forcing the procession to stop. Inside the sedan chair, [Jin Lan] heard the noisy shouts outside and couldn't help but lift the curtain to see what was happening.
1:14:48|1:14:58|Facing overwhelming odds, [Yanzi Li San] stood in front of the plump matchmaker, blocking her, while the men who were trying to surround him were pushed apart and accidentally bumped into the matchmaker's chest.
1:14:58|1:15:22|[Yanzi Li San] took the opportunity to push the matchmaker towards the others. Seeing several people being overwhelmed by the matchmaker, [Yanzi Li San] quickly opened the sedan curtain and called out for [Jin Lan]. Before Hua Wa could finish speaking, he was dragged out and forced to continue struggling with the others. One person took the opportunity to lock Hua Wa's arms from behind, and Hua Wa was kicked in the buttocks.
1:15:22|1:15:27|Several people forcibly dragged Tiger Baby out, accidentally pulling down her pants.
1:15:27|1:15:32|Huwa saw the situation was not good, threw the stolen money into the air, and slipped away quietly while everyone was fighting for the money.
1:15:42|1:15:47|In the prison, [Yanzi Li San] tossed and turned, suddenly stood up and looked at the guard, then gazed at the ceiling.
1:15:47|1:15:52|In the bridal chamber, [Jin Lan] anxiously waits for the arrival of [Yanzi Li San], but there is no sign of the other person.
1:15:52|1:15:59|He walked towards the door, pondered for a moment, then opened it to take a look. A lightning accompanied by thunder startled Jin Lan.
1:15:59|1:16:8|He turned his head and saw Pus standing on his right, with [Jin Lan] tightly pressed against the door, repeatedly retreating. Pus advanced step by step into the room, then closed the door.
1:16:9|1:16:28|[Yanzi Li San] climbed up to the window high in the prison, seeing that several guards were not paying attention to him. He used a bone-shrinking bow to drill through the railing, covered one of the guards' heads with his clothes, and jumped down from the height when the other guards had not reacted yet. He launched an attack on the guards, who were no match for [Yanzi Li San] and were quickly knocked down to the ground.
1:16:51|1:17:12|Tonight, Yanzi Li San was pushed against the table corner by Puzi. Facing the prison guards rushing to help outside the door, Yanzi Li San used all her skills. Seeing all the guards blocking her being knocked down, the guard with the keys quickly begged for mercy.
1:17:12|1:17:14|The face of Yanzi Li San, who was kicked, instantly turned ferocious.
1:17:17|1:17:22|Turning around and picking up the accessories hanging on the walking stick, Yanzi Li San unsheathed the sword and walked angrily towards the fallen Jin Lan.
1:17:22|1:17:32|[Jin Lan] kept retreating as the lightning flashed and thunder roared. After a figure flashed by, Zhang Lu, who was guarding the door, quickly jumped up and grabbed the person.
1:17:45|1:17:54|Yanzi Li San took the opportunity to rush towards the door, but Zhang Lu blocked Yanzi Li San's path with her leg. The two did not give way to each other. Inside the room, they pushed Jin Lan onto the bed and urged her fiercely.
1:18:3|1:18:7|Upon hearing Jin Lan's response, Yanzi Li San wanted to step forward, but was blocked by Zhang Lu.
1:18:42|1:18:46|[Yanzi Li San] pushed open the door, only to see [Jin Lan] being stabbed by Pu Si.
1:18:46|1:18:50|[Yanzi Li San] kicked Park Shi away and stabbed the sword into his chest.
1:18:54|1:19:0|Covered in blood, [Jin Lan] leaned on [Yanzi Li San] and tightly held [Yanzi Li San]'s hand.
1:19:0|1:19:4|Zhang Lu caught up and saw the dying Bodhisattva.
1:19:4|1:19:5|[Yanzi Li San] carries [Jin Lan] away.
1:19:32|1:19:38|After Zhang Lu saw Pu Si's disdain and thought for a moment, he looked fiercely in the direction that [Yanzi Li San] and Jin Lan had left.
1:19:38|1:19:47|In the deepening night, under the bell tower of the city wall, Lai Fu, Luo Xia, and Hu Wa stood silently behind [Yanzi Li San], only to see [Yanzi Li San] sitting on the ground, holding [Jin Lan] in his arms.
1:19:49|1:19:59|Yanzi Li San called out faintly to Jin Lan, placing their token of love into Jin Lan's hand. Jin Lan struggled to bring the sachet to her nose.
1:20:21|1:20:25|[Jin Lan] The flower shadow had just fallen when the sachet rolled out of her palm.
1:20:25|1:20:33|Yanzi Li San gently lifted Jin Lan's lifeless face and slowly pressed it against his own.
1:20:33|1:20:38|[Yanzi Li San] gently placed [Jin Lan]'s hands on her chest, then lowered her head and cried softly.
1:20:38|1:20:43|The three people behind, seeing Jin Lan has already left, all kneel down behind Yanzi Li San.
1:20:43|1:20:48|At the foot of the city tower, Yanzi Li San walked forward with a look of anger on her face, when suddenly the sound of galloping hooves came from behind.
1:20:49|1:20:55|He turned his head to see a large group of soldiers holding oil lamps, riding on swift horses and galloping towards him.
1:20:55|1:20:59|Zhang Lu quickly retreated to the side to avoid the spirited horse and observed the opponent.
1:20:59|1:21:4|Behind the cavalry, there are many soldiers running forward, all heading towards the direction of the building where [Yanzi Li San] is located.
1:21:6|1:21:10|Zhang Lu sensed something was wrong and followed the soldiers to the Sword Tower.
1:21:10|1:21:17|Hearing the shouts of soldiers downstairs, Huwa hurried to the edge of the city wall to peek and saw the soldiers quickly filling up the area below.
1:21:17|1:21:19|Tiger Baby returned to [Yanzi Li San]'s side, anxiously saying.
1:21:46|1:21:54|Lai Fu took the two away with a gun, [Yanzi Li San] saw them leaving, looked at the gold pellets on the ground, and his eyes instantly turned fierce.
1:21:54|1:22:3|Downstairs, two rows of soldiers lined up waiting, a sedan parked in the middle. Captain Tang and Ma Yingjie got off from the sides of the vehicle, both looking up at the top of the building.
1:22:12|1:22:19|In Jianlou, [Yanzi Li San] tried to delay time for Lai Fusan by vigorously swinging the clock pendulum to attract everyone's attention.
1:22:33|1:22:37|With Ma Yingjie's permission, Zhang Lu displayed his light skills and quickly climbed up the city tower.
1:22:43|1:22:47|Zhang Lu went up to the city tower and immediately found the location of [Yanzi Li San].
1:22:47|1:22:55|Yanzi Li San is half kneeling beside Jin Lan's body. Zhang Lu slowly approaches, and Yanzi Li San slowly turns his head to look as someone goes upstairs.
1:22:55|1:23:0|The person who came in was [Zhang Lu], she stood up and glared fiercely at the other person.
1:23:11|1:23:16|[Yanzi Li San] clenched his fist and walked towards [Zhang Lu].
1:23:16|1:23:23|After speaking, [Yanzi Li San] leaped forward with all his strength, delivering a flying kick towards [Zhang Lu], only to be easily dodged by the opponent, feeling helpless as they were from the same school.
1:23:23|1:23:28|After a few moves, the fight between Yanzi Li San and Jin Lan did not cause any substantial harm to each other.
1:23:28|1:23:33|[Ma Yingjie] and [Captain Tang] each lead a team of soldiers running up from both sides of the city wall.
1:23:33|1:23:37|After the reunion, [Ma Yingjie] commanded his men to split into two groups and search for [Yanzi Li San].
1:23:37|1:23:41|[Yanzi Li San] and [Jin Lan] are exchanging blows back and forth, gradually getting into their rhythm.
1:23:41|1:23:50|[Yanzi Li San] seized the upper limb gap that [Zhang Lu] left unguarded, kicking [Zhang Lu] into the big clock. He followed up with another kick, solidly hitting [Zhang Lu] in the chest.
1:23:50|1:23:55|[Zhang Lu] counterattacked, landing a punch on the face of [Yanzi Li San]. [Ma Yingjie] and others heard the sound of the fight and stopped in their tracks.
1:23:57|1:24:15|Seeing [Ma Yingjie] suddenly stop, [Captain Tang] waved to the soldiers behind him, then the two of them led the soldiers towards the direction of the sound. As they reached the middle of the corridor, the sounds of fighting were indistinguishable. The two split up again, with [Yanzi Li San] being kicked down below the bell cone. Seeing [Zhang Lu] looking reluctant, he quickly got up and kicked the bell cone towards the opponent.
1:24:15|1:24:19|Zhang Lu couldn't avoid it and was knocked down by the heavy wooden beam.
1:24:19|1:24:39|[Yanzi Li San] pursued the enemy, and when Zhang Lu saw the log flying towards him again, he quickly dodged the attack by flipping over. Seeing Zhang Lu standing up unsteadily and assuming a defensive posture, [Yanzi Li San] gathered strength to deliver a final blow, but suddenly a bullet hit his right shoulder.
1:24:39|1:24:45|Upon realizing, Zhang Lu turned around and looked towards the direction where the shots were fired, but was shot dead by the squad led by [Ma Yingjie].
1:24:52|1:25:7|Ma Yingjie started to observe the surroundings when he didn't see Yanzi Li San. He looked up and saw no one on the roof, but was suddenly drawn to the bloodstains climbing up the bell.
1:25:7|1:25:16|Soldiers leaned against the pillars to form a human wall, climbing up on all sides simultaneously.
1:25:16|1:25:20|The soldier who climbed up the beam carefully searched but did not find the figure of [Yanzi Li San].
1:25:29|1:25:43|[Yanzi Li San] reached out and gently picked up the swallow perched on the branch, the little swallow pecked at his fingers.
1:25:43|1:25:47|[Yanzi Li San] released the swallow, but as soon as the little swallow flew out, it was shot down by a bullet and fell to the ground.
1:25:51|1:26:2|[Yanzi Li San] found that Captain Tang's followers had caught up. He jumped directly from the tree and couldn't get close due to the intense firepower from the other side, so he had to roll backwards to create distance.
1:26:2|1:26:8|[Yanzi Li San] tackled the lone follower, snatched his gun and fired back. [Yanzi Li San] then pulled the follower up to shield himself from the bullets.
1:26:10|1:26:24|Captain Tang emerged from the woods, but there was no sign of [Yanzi Li San]. He carefully pushed aside the branches blocking his view, and [Yanzi Li San] suddenly jumped in front of him. However, Captain Tang, who was already on guard, easily dodged the attack. Their bodies intertwined as their fists collided.
1:26:26|1:26:31|Captain Tang launched another attack, sweeping back and forth repeatedly, not giving Yanzi Li San a chance to get up.
1:26:31|1:26:35|[Yanzi Li San] stood up at the right moment and delivered a heavy punch to Captain Tang's face.
1:26:35|1:26:40|Captain Tang, after taking a punch, used the momentum to fiercely strike [Yanzi Li San] in the back.
1:26:40|1:26:47|[Yanzi Li San] saw the distance being pulled apart, and delivered a series of flying kicks towards Captain Tang's chest.
1:26:47|1:26:48|Yanzi Li San is surrounded by the crowd.
1:26:51|1:27:4|On the other side, Ma Yingjie led a large group of soldiers rushing to support Captain Tang. Captain Tang slammed [Yanzi Li San] to the ground, and [Yanzi Li San] used his elbow to suppress Captain Tang, launching a series of attacks on Captain Tang's chest. Captain Tang seized the opportunity and grabbed [Yanzi Li San]'s injured right shoulder.
1:27:7|1:27:27|[Yanzi Li San] suddenly lifted his knee to Captain Tang's waist, Captain Tang didn't have time to dodge, making a dull sound. Ma Yingjie arrived just in time, commanding his subordinates, a soldier leaped and kicked down the unprepared [Yanzi Li San]. Seeing this, the follower stepped on the right shoulder of [Yanzi Li San] who was held up by two people, looking ahead.
1:27:27|1:27:37|Finding their vision becoming blurry, the two of them knocked down [Yanzi Li San]. A soldier randomly drew a knife from his waist, and the fallen [Yanzi Li San] picked up the fallen swallow.
1:27:39|1:27:46|The soldier viciously stabbed Yanzi Li San in the back, causing Yanzi Li San to instantly pass out.
1:27:46|1:27:50|Soldiers suddenly ran down the street, with Yanzi Li San and Jin Lan in the middle.
1:27:50|1:27:56|After standing in position, Yanzi Li San used his gun to block the crowded people from approaching, while another group of infantry soldiers rudely pushed and shoved pedestrians standing on the road.
1:28:1|1:28:7|Several soldiers rode past on horse-drawn carriages, forcing the civilians to step back. A pedestrian shouted angrily at the soldiers.
1:28:30|1:28:47|Yanzi Li San, wearing a shirt soaked in blood, stood dizzily in the middle of the cart, with his hands tied behind his back, and a dagger with the word "princess" inserted behind him.
1:28:55|1:28:57|[Yanzi Li San] awoke quietly amidst the crowd's cries.
1:29:6|1:29:15|The gloomy uncle took advantage of the golf cart approaching to try to feed the remaining wine in the bowl to [Yanzi Li San].
1:29:24|1:29:26|[Yanzi Li San] looked up, feeling the wine sprinkled in the air.
1:29:37|1:29:49|The moment the ball car kept driving towards the execution platform, the emotions of the people slowly changed from excitement to sorrow. They spontaneously knelt in the direction Yanzi Li San was leaving, their eyes revealing deep sorrow.
1:29:49|1:29:56|[金兰] who was following behind, seeing this scene, was at a loss for a moment. The Tiger Cub, who broke through the soldiers' blockade, knelt by the roadside, crying uncontrollably.
1:29:59|1:30:9|Hundreds of swallows flew in from a distance, circling around [Yanzi] and [Li San], as if the common people by the river were bidding farewell together to this hero who had eliminated evil for the people.
