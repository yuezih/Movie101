0:2:22|0:2:31|The setting sun shines on the Great Wall, with [Liang Xiaoxiao] leaning against the wall and [Qin Fen] kneeling on one knee holding a diamond ring.
0:3:54|0:3:57|After speaking, he also kissed the hand of [Liang Xiaoxiao].
0:3:58|0:4:8|The two of them proposed on the Great Wall at sunset, but whether the proposal was accepted or not remains uncertain. The love and hatred between them has just begun.
0:4:9|0:4:21|After the rain, the pond was full of vitality, with lotus leaves covering the surface. This secluded park was about to come alive today because of a ceremony. A black convertible hurriedly drove by.
0:4:21|0:4:24|The flowers in the car are hard to ignore,
0:4:24|0:4:34|The clattering of hooves on the cement road was crisp and attention-grabbing. And it didn't stop there, several low-key black sedans followed behind.
0:4:35|0:4:47|They were all heading towards one direction, which was the scene of the ceremony. Two tall horses pulled a European-style carriage, with the coachman in the front and two others sitting in the luxurious carriage behind.
0:4:47|0:4:49|A rare beauty as well.
0:4:49|0:4:56|The exquisite and elegant attire, complemented by the charming faces of [Mango] and [Liang Xiaoxiao], the two of them in long dresses, headpieces, and even veils.
0:4:56|0:5:6|The carriage driver drove the carriage over the small bridge and quickly arrived at the ceremony venue. In front of the European-style building, welcoming the guests was a woman in a gauze skirt with a flower crown on her head.
0:5:6|0:5:17|There is also a man in a full black suit. They look solemn, waiting for the arrival of the guests. The carriage slowly stops, and the bell in the box rings, as if announcing the protagonist of today.
0:5:17|0:5:26|About to make an entrance. The man with a beard and crew cut is [Li Xiangshan], he strides over, opens the car door, and gallantly helps [Mango] out of the carriage, followed by [Liang Xiaoxiao].
0:5:26|0:5:32|Also lifted her long skirt and helped down by the coachman, the two hosts walked side by side with [Liang Xiaoxiao].
0:5:32|0:5:40|Three people walked behind, with [Mango] holding [Li Xiangshan]'s arm. Amidst the music, they entered this European-style building.
0:5:40|0:5:47|The backyard is full of guests, hosted by [Qin Fen].
0:6:1|0:6:12|The symphony plays as the guests in the audience look towards the other end of the red carpet. In the spotlight, [Mango] walks towards the stage with [Li Xiangshan] by her side, followed slowly by [Liang Xiaoxiao] and her female companion.
0:6:12|0:6:19|[Li Xiangshan] squinted his eyes, looking serious, while [Mango] remained solemn. The shiny leather shoes and long skirt hem moved forward.
0:6:19|0:6:27|The footsteps on the carpet moved forward with the music. Soon, several people arrived at the front of the stage, unfolding this unique divorce ceremony.
0:6:27|0:6:35|On stage, [Qin Fen] watched as they approached, then turned to the band and waved in greeting.
0:6:36|0:6:43|[Li Xiangshan] and [Mango] stand on the left and right of [Qin Fen], while [Liang Xiaoxiao] stands next to [Mango].
0:6:59|0:7:6|[Qin Fen]'s quirky speech amused the guests present.
0:7:51|0:8:5|[Mango] glanced sideways at [Li Xiangshan] expressionlessly, and the two quickly took off their rings as if afraid of being late, this marriage was doomed.
0:8:30|0:8:34|[Qin Fen] raised a large red Chinese character for "double happiness", and the two of them each held a knife to cut it open.
0:8:34|0:8:44|[Qin Fen] placed the cut "喜" character in a copper basin and lit it up. The flames quickly consumed the paper-made character as [Qin Fen] continued speaking,
0:8:46|0:8:48|After he finished speaking, he looked at [Mango], then turned to look at [Li Xiangshan].
0:8:50|0:9:2|[Mango] and [Li Xiangshan] shook hands on stage. Amidst the cheers of the crowd, [Li Xiangshan] grabbed [Mango] and embraced her.
0:9:8|0:9:19|The atmosphere on the scene was particularly lively, as if the funeral of this love was a comedy in their eyes. The passionate symphony was accompanied by applause.
0:9:19|0:9:26|The ceremony is almost over. The cocktail party is about to begin, with [Li Xiangshan] holding [Mango]'s hand to cut the cake.
0:9:28|0:9:35|The two of them together raised a bottle of wine and poured champagne.
0:9:37|0:9:42|The flock of pigeons soared into the sky, and [Qin Fen] started playing with the balloon again.
0:9:45|0:9:50|Liang Xiaoxiao looked at Xuanxuan and felt that there seemed to be a hint of admiration for Qin Fen in her eyes.
0:9:56|0:10:4|[Qin Fen] gave a thumbs up to Xuan Xuan, who playfully stuck out her tongue at him. Back on stage, [Qin Fen] didn't notice the sharp gaze from [Liang Xiaoxiao].
0:13:4|0:13:15|The car door is closed, and the car drives away slowly. The night falls quietly on the city, the streets are still bustling, the lights are still bright, the world will not stop because of anyone's joy or sorrow.
0:13:15|0:13:23|The mixture of joy and sorrow can be suffocating. The end of a relationship, even with a dignified ceremony, cannot disguise its tragedy.
0:13:23|0:13:29|Under the streetlight, the RV drove towards home. Inside the car, [Liang Xiaoxiao] yawned.
0:13:31|0:13:49|[Qin Fen] gave a wry smile, [Liang Xiaoxiao] raised her hand to show off the ring, while [Mango] carefully examined it while holding [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s hand, as if afraid that her best friend was being deceived.
0:14:15|0:14:21|[Qin Fen] licked his lips and turned around, saying,
0:14:28|0:14:43|[Mango] was amused by [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s words and the two women laughed freely in the back seat. [Liang Xiaoxiao] was actually a flight attendant. On this day, the flight was heading from Beijing to Sanya Airport, and [Liang Xiaoxiao] as usual, went to the first class cabin.
0:14:43|0:14:55|She approached a man who was having Western food, holding a bottle of red wine in each hand. She asked the stylish man who was reading a fashion magazine with an elegant demeanor.
0:14:56|0:15:7|In the second inquiry from [Liang Xiaoxiao], he finally took his eyes off the magazine. The man looked up along the wine bottle, admiring the exquisite beauty of [Liang Xiaoxiao].
0:15:9|0:15:18|Liang Xiaoxiao stood still in front of him. He first put away the fork, stood up, walked around Liang Xiaoxiao, opened the high-end leather suitcase next to him, and inside was a crown studded with gems. He opened the bottom layer, and
0:15:18|0:15:30|It's a pair of exaggerated earrings. He carefully put them on [Liang Xiaoxiao], then gently flicked the gemstone earrings hanging on [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s ears. And that's not all, he then took out the beautiful crown and dazzling
0:15:30|0:15:36|The necklace is put on [Liang Xiaoxiao] one by one. Women are naturally irresistible to jewelry.
0:15:57|0:16:3|[Liang Xiaoxiao] said shyly. Soon the flight arrived in Sanya, and with the roar of the plane, [Liang Xiaoxiao] reached the destination of this trip.
0:16:11|0:16:14|When the plane slowly comes to a stop on the runway, the tropical vibe is already in the air.
0:16:14|0:16:20|The scorching sun baked the earth, and the airport's distinctive giant pineapple exuded warmth to the tourists.
0:16:20|0:16:29|Flight attendant [Liang Xiaoxiao] is familiar with all this, but what makes her feel unfamiliar is this trial marriage journey. On the plane, [Liang Xiaoxiao] unbuckles her seatbelt and looks out.
0:16:29|0:16:35|She then stood up, ready to get off the plane. But as she passed by the sissy man, he started to flirt with her.
0:16:37|0:16:45|[Liang Xiaoxiao] nodded slightly and then walked past him off the plane. Not far away, a man wearing a duckbill cap walked over and handcuffed the sissy, with the other end of the handcuffs
0:16:45|0:16:57|The high-end leather suitcase was locked. The airplane door opened, with ground security guards holding guns and an armored vehicle parked nearby. A flamboyant man carried the suitcase onto the vehicle smoothly, while [Liang Xiaoxiao] witnessed it all.
0:16:57|0:17:13|At noon in the airport lobby, the crowd was bustling, and a wooden airplane hung from the ceiling, as if announcing the charm of the tourist city to the visitors. The roof, made of neatly arranged wooden strips, had a unique summer flavor.
0:17:13|0:17:20|Dressed in a uniform, [Liang Xiaoxiao] showed off her well-proportioned figure.
0:17:37|0:17:43|Seeing [Qin Fen], [Liang Xiaoxiao] holding a phone walking towards him, even hiding behind the wall giggling, glanced at [Qin Fen].
0:17:43|0:17:56|The silly [Qin Fen] was still searching in the crowd, while [Liang Xiaoxiao] had already changed out of her uniform in the restroom. As she walked out of the cubicle, she tidied her hair and walked towards the mirror. She casually placed her changed clothes on the nearby suitcase.
0:18:24|0:18:33|The phone on the table kept ringing, but [Liang Xiaoxiao] ignored it. At that moment, a waiter brought a cup of coffee and placed it in front of [Liang Xiaoxiao].
0:18:35|0:18:44|The phone rang, but [Liang Xiaoxiao] calmly picked up her coffee, while [Qin Fen] in the lobby looked flustered at the sparse crowd.
0:18:44|0:18:51|[Liang Xiaoxiao] put down her coffee, looked through the gaps in the potted plant towards the hall, and answered the phone with a smile.
0:19:18|0:19:30|In the hall, [Qin Fen] on the phone suddenly caught sight of [Liang Xiaoxiao] behind the potted plant. He wasn't sure, just turned his head and walked slowly towards the back of the hall. [Liang Xiaoxiao], on the other hand, happily put down her phone, picked up the book in her arms, and started reading it with relish.
0:19:31|0:19:40|[Qin Fen] figured out the whole farce and walked over with a bouquet of flowers in hand. [Liang Xiaoxiao] closed the book in disbelief, turned her head, and glared at [Qin Fen] with a displeased expression.
0:19:40|0:19:47|After all, they were going to be husband and wife, so the two of them didn't immediately make a fuss about it.
0:19:47|0:19:52|On both sides of the road leading to Yalong Bay, there is lush greenery, and sunlight filters through the coconut trees.
0:19:52|0:20:6|An SUV speeds through the shade of trees, with [Qin Fen] behind the wheel and [Liang Xiaoxiao] in the passenger seat. [Qin Fen] is wearing sunglasses and focused on driving, while [Liang Xiaoxiao] is pouting and still upset about something that happened earlier.
0:20:6|0:20:14|[Qin Fen] glanced at [Liang Xiaoxiao] and then opened his mouth first.
0:21:39|0:21:44|[Liang Xiaoxiao] smiled confidently, while [Qin Fen] glanced sideways.
0:21:57|0:22:17|[Liang Xiaoxiao] immediately slapped [Qin Fen] on the shoulder, looking at his fearful expression. [Liang Xiaoxiao] couldn't help but smile. She flipped her hair and looked out the window. As [Qin Fen] leaned in to look at her expression, [Liang Xiaoxiao] pretended to push him away in mock anger.
0:22:17|0:22:23|[Qin Fen] took [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s hand and kissed it, but [Liang Xiaoxiao] disdainfully wiped the saliva from the back of her hand onto [Qin Fen].
0:22:23|0:22:32|Yalong Bay is a famous seaside resort, facing the sea and backed by green mountains. The tropical climate all year round gives this place a vibrant atmosphere.
0:22:32|0:22:41|The car slowly approached on the winding road beside the hill, with dense trees on both sides adding a touch of beauty to the scene.
0:22:41|0:22:48|Far away from the hustle and bustle of the city streets, this place, like a paradise on earth, is indeed more suitable for living.
0:22:49|0:22:56|The setting sun shines through the trees onto the road, making everything here seem poetic.
0:22:56|0:23:1|[Liang Xiaoxiao] looked at [Qin Fen] with a bright smile on her face, and the wonderful trial marriage journey began.
0:23:1|0:23:6|The car carries the longing for love of two people, and the winding mountain road is like the magic in their relationship.
0:23:8|0:23:22|Driving along, [Qin Fen] was not bored at all. He would occasionally hold [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s hand and kiss her. [Liang Xiaoxiao] would squint her eyes, letting the afternoon sun shine on her delicate eyes, enjoying the warmth.
0:23:22|0:23:28|Several hours of driving, and we have arrived at Yalong Bay, but there is still some distance to go to the accommodation.
0:23:28|0:23:36|The narrow chain ladder could not accommodate a behemoth like a car, so the two had to carry their boxes and walk over. Before long, they arrived at their residence.
0:23:36|0:23:44|The wooden stairs exuded a primitive cleanliness, [Liang Xiaoxiao] followed [Qin Fen]'s pace and quickly walked down.
0:23:44|0:23:49|There was not even time to glance at the beautiful scenery around. Upon arriving at the residence, there was also the same wooden staircase.
0:23:49|0:23:58|The two walked through the corridor and arrived at their long-awaited residence. The waiter arranged the shoe cabinet at the entrance, while [Qin Fen] quickly stepped forward, took out the key, and opened the door.
0:23:59|0:24:6|[Liang Xiaoxiao] finally stopped to admire this ancient and picturesque house.
0:24:7|0:24:14|[Qin Fen] stuffed his luggage into the door, greeted [Liang Xiaoxiao] at the entrance, and was amazed by the decoration in the room when [Liang Xiaoxiao] entered.
0:24:14|0:24:26|The wooden walls are shiny, with several bird cages hanging with unidentifiable birds, and ancient paintings framed on the walls. Passing through the entrance, the interior is full of Nordic style: huge and simple.
0:24:26|0:24:33|The sofa, various walnut tables, chairs, and cabinets, the corner bookshelf stuffed with books,
0:24:33|0:24:44|All of this made [Liang Xiaoxiao] look at [Qin Fen] in a new light. She admired [Qin Fen], casually placed her handbag on the sofa, and walked towards the window holding the pot of flowers. She excitedly arrived at the window, two
0:24:44|0:24:50|With his arms propped up, he looked outwards, where green mountains met the sea, giving a sense of being detached from the world.
0:24:50|0:24:53|[Qin Fen] walked past the sofa and approached the bathtub on the balcony,
0:24:58|0:25:15|He turned on the faucet, cleaning the bathtub. Hearing the noise, Liang Xiaoxiao walked over and lightly kicked Qin Fen. Qin Fen turned around solemnly and said,
0:25:53|0:26:2|[Liang Xiaoxiao] propped up her head, smiling at [Qin Fen]. After speaking, she put her arm around [Qin Fen] and rested her head on his shoulder.
0:26:10|0:26:19|After finishing speaking, she stood up to go change clothes. The packed suitcase was carefully prepared by [Liang Xiaoxiao] this time. At this moment, [Qin Fen] walked over to look at her.
0:26:29|0:26:35|Qin Fen took off his shoes and sat down next to Liang Xiaoxiao.
0:26:42|0:26:56|Liang Xiaoxiao pushes Qin Fen out of the room from behind and closes the door. In the evening, with colorful clouds hanging on the horizon, the two of them sit by the spacious swimming pool, soaking their feet.
0:27:22|0:27:28|[Qin Fen] didn't answer immediately, took a sip of beer in his hand,
0:28:12|0:28:23|Going down the stairs, there are more stairs to climb ahead.
0:28:43|0:28:57|Halfway up the stairs, [Qin Fen] almost fell again. Inside the room, [Liang Xiaoxiao] was tidying up the bed, while [Qin Fen] was closing the window with a pole. He shouted in pain as if he was injured.
0:29:23|0:29:35|[Liang Xiaoxiao] didn't dare to neglect, quickly followed suit, [Liang Xiaoxiao] pressed both palms against [Qin Fen]'s waist, gave a displeased look at the CD, and walked over.
0:29:37|0:29:49|The door opened, and Qin Fen came with a new request. Liang Xiaoxiao, considering his injury, complied.
0:30:7|0:30:15|[Liang Xiaoxiao] was fooled and stunned. Without much thought, she lifted her veil and rode on [Qin Fen].
0:30:25|0:30:34|Liang Xiaoxiao feels the taste of being a devoted couple.
0:30:44|0:30:49|[Liang Xiaoxiao] is massaging his legs over and over again.
0:30:58|0:31:10|Seeing no movement from [Qin Fen] for a while, [Liang Xiaoxiao] stopped her actions and leaned forward to look at [Qin Fen]. She went to the bathroom to wash her hands, rubbing the soap on her face with a displeased expression, knowing that she had been fooled.
0:31:11|0:31:20|The taste of being a couple in adversity is completely gone. Knowing that [Qin Fen] has fallen asleep, [Liang Xiaoxiao] finally lies comfortably in the bathtub soaking in the bath. Night falls.
0:31:20|0:31:23|The twinkling lights illuminate the bustling crowd.
0:31:23|0:31:35|The old-fashioned fan in the room kept spinning, gently blowing the bed curtains. [Qin Fen] hadn't even taken off his clothes, lying on the bed sound asleep, while [Liang Xiaoxiao] lay beside him watching.
0:31:35|0:31:41|Perhaps due to lying down for too long, [Qin Fen] unconsciously turned over and happened to open his eyes, only to see [Liang Xiaoxiao] staring at him.
0:31:41|0:31:55|He hesitated for a moment, then quickly looked up at [Liang Xiaoxiao]. Faced with [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s questioning, [Qin Fen] chose to ignore it and continued sleeping, even reaching out groggily to embrace [Liang Xiaoxiao].
0:31:55|0:32:2|Liang Xiaoxiao pushed him away, Qin Fen leaned in.
0:32:8|0:32:16|Liang Xiaoxiao turned over, with her back to Qin Fen. Qin Fen pulled Liang Xiaoxiao back, while Liang Xiaoxiao held onto the edge of the bed tightly, the two of them struggling against each other.
0:32:16|0:32:25|[Qin Fen] suddenly let go, and [Liang Xiaoxiao] couldn't stop herself, falling off the bed. Upset, [Liang Xiaoxiao] came to the living room holding a pillow and blanket.
0:32:36|0:32:46|[Qin Fen] intercepted [Liang Xiaoxiao] as she walked towards the room, pressing her down on the sofa and sitting on the coffee table. In a knowing tone, [Qin Fen] said,
0:34:40|0:34:48|Leave [Qin Fen] on the sofa. The next morning, a young man with a folding wheelchair arrived at the door. He supported the wheelchair with one hand and rang the doorbell with the other.
0:34:49|0:34:55|In the room, [Liang Xiaoxiao] was comfortably lying on the bed sleeping, but the annoying doorbell didn't want to let her rest.
0:34:56|0:35:5|Liang Xiaoxiao, who was disturbed from her peaceful dream, frowned and got up. Barefoot, she walked towards the door, and in her nightgown, she blinked as she opened the door.
0:35:6|0:35:15|The young man politely explained his intentions, and [Liang Xiaoxiao] was completely caught off guard, let alone believing it.
0:35:18|0:35:30|[Liang Xiaoxiao] paused for a moment, looked into the room, and then walked towards it with a puzzled expression. After scanning around, she didn't see [Qin Fen] on the sofa, so she took a few steps forward and spotted [Qin Fen] on a chair.
0:35:34|0:35:49|As she spoke, she lifted her foot and stepped on the recliner. Hearing this, [Liang Xiaoxiao] looked displeased, realizing immediately that this was [Qin Fen] retaliating against her.
0:36:38|0:36:46|After closing the door, [Liang Xiaoxiao] went straight to the bathroom, struggling here early in the morning. When [Qin Fen] heard the sound,
0:36:54|0:37:2|On a rainy day, a warship is docked at the pier, with the navy troops on shore standing in neat rows. Liang Xiaoxiao and Mango look up at the navy boarding the ship.
0:37:3|0:37:16|[Mango] took the binoculars and looked towards the navy, while [Liang Xiaoxiao] cast a disdainful glance at [Mango]. The whistle blew, and the navy was about to set sail.
0:37:25|0:37:39|The music started playing as two navy soldiers ran onto the deck. One of the soldiers stood tall and looked back at [Mango] with reluctance, while the soldiers on the dock came forward to untie the ropes. Amidst the sound of the horn, the families on the dock waved goodbye to the departing ship.
0:37:39|0:37:49|[Mango] still held the binoculars reluctantly, staring at the handsome face of the naval officer. The smokestack on the ship emitted black smoke, and [Mango] watched as her beloved was about to sail away, unable to help but cover her mouth.
0:37:49|0:37:57|Tears welled up in her eyes, while [Liang Xiaoxiao] looked at [Mango] with a comforting expression. The ship accelerated and left the dock amidst joyful music.
0:37:57|0:38:4|After the event, [Liang Xiaoxiao] drove with [Mango] towards Yalong Bay.
0:38:33|0:38:40|In the residence of Yalong Bay, [Qin Fen] is sitting on the balcony with his legs crossed, eating an apple. The small table in front of him is covered with fruit peels.
0:38:40|0:38:50|Upon hearing footsteps, [Qin Fen] quickly changed his posture to feign illness. The newcomer was none other than [Mango], who covered [Qin Fen]'s eyes from behind and planted a kiss on his bald head.
0:39:15|0:39:22|Mango approached, not believing, and took a sniff.
0:39:32|0:39:39|Liang Xiaoxiao squatted down and started cleaning up the fruit peels on the table.
0:39:41|0:39:46|[Qin Fen] pretended to be asleep with his head down and eyes squinted, showing no fear like a dead pig in hot water.
0:39:51|0:39:56|[Qin Fen] glanced back at [Liang Xiaoxiao] taking out the trash.
0:41:3|0:41:11|[Qin Fen] is full of anger. He hands the peeled mango to [Mango], who turns her head away.
0:41:34|0:41:47|[Qin Fen] handed the teacup to [Mango], who got up to pour the tea. Sitting in the wheelchair, [Qin Fen] took a big bite of [Mango], enjoying the meal immensely.
0:42:9|0:42:14|Liang Xiaoxiao handed the teacup to Mango as she spoke.
0:42:52|0:42:57|A car slowly stops in front of a luxury hotel, and the staff come forward to open the door.
0:43:12|0:43:24|The luxurious decoration in the hotel exudes a sense of luxury, with the trendy and sexy two girlfriends chatting and laughing in front, followed by [Qin Fen] in a wheelchair. He lowers his hat, crosses his legs, and
0:43:24|0:43:34|Sitting happily in the wheelchair, [Qin Fen] almost got thrown out when the wheelchair got stuck on a step unnoticed by the staff. The two girlfriends glanced back but didn't pay any attention.
0:43:34|0:43:45|In the tropical-themed hotel, there were no private rooms, only wooden parasols under which small tables could accommodate three to five people for dining. The three of them chose a small table and sat down.
0:43:45|0:43:49|The waiter approached with the menu.
0:43:52|0:44:6|[Liang Xiaoxiao] took the menu and looked at [Qin Fen], asking if he was going to fully embody the identity of the old man.
0:44:42|0:44:46|[Liang Xiaoxiao] was not polite to [Qin Fen], but [Qin Fen] was quite easy-going and showed his front teeth with a smile.
0:44:46|0:44:52|[Liang Xiaoxiao] noticed a familiar figure waving at her. [Qin Fen] was startled and turned to look.
0:44:56|0:45:1|The other party greeted, [Liang Xiaoxiao] immediately stood up, while [Qin Fen] looked puzzled, feeling a bit uncomfortable in his heart.
0:45:1|0:45:8|Liang Xiaoxiao just walked down the steps, and the other person quickly put up a sun umbrella to shade her, while Mango pulled Qin Fen over.
0:46:19|0:46:29|Qin Fen was feeling jealous and almost rushed over. Seeing the dishes being served but the person not arriving yet, Qin Fen spun his wheelchair.
0:46:30|0:46:34|He rolled up to the steps, and the staff hurried forward to assist.
0:46:35|0:46:41|[Qin Fen] stared straight at the table, then got up and walked past the staff towards [Liang Xiaoxiao].
0:47:4|0:47:13|[Qin Fen] leaned in closer, staring with a puzzled expression, "I don't have any impression at all."
0:47:16|0:47:28|[Qin Fen] frowned and said somewhat discontentedly, while [Liang Xiaoxiao] finished taking photos and got up to leave.
0:47:48|0:48:5|[Liang Xiaoxiao] pressed the fire and said, the waiter removed the encirclement, and the beef was placed in front of [Qin Fen], who remained silent.
0:48:6|0:48:15|Watching [Liang Xiaoxiao] getting angry, [Qin Fen] didn't dare to provoke her further. He picked up his knife and fork, intending to focus on eating the steak.
0:49:5|0:49:9|On the side, [Liang Xiaoxiao] couldn't bear to listen anymore, after all, she really wanted to go.
0:49:9|0:49:16|Just then, the phone rang and [Liang Xiaoxiao] picked it up.
0:49:22|0:49:26|[Qin Fen] has no good feelings towards these people.
0:49:26|0:49:39|The supposed enjoyable dinner ended in this way, with [Liang Xiaoxiao] in a long dress leaning on the sink in the bathroom, looking like she had just cried.
0:50:20|0:50:24|[Qin Fen] sends [Mango] forward, and the staff opens the car door.
0:50:24|0:50:32|On the other side, [Liang Xiaoxiao] draped in a coat, arms crossed in front of her chest, walked slowly.
0:50:34|0:50:47|[Qin Fen] grabbed the keys, pushed the wheelchair towards the parking lot, and took this opportunity to calm down [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s emotions. After all, the emotional outburst was only temporary, deep down, both of them were very serious about each other.
0:50:47|0:50:52|Returning home, [Liang Xiaoxiao] picked out a few dresses and twirled them in front of the mirror with the hanger.
0:50:58|0:51:10|[Qin Fen] leaned against the door frame, holding a plate and eating the watermelon inside. He mumbled some opinions, while [Liang Xiaoxiao] glanced at her clothes and nodded. Then she opened the jewelry box on the bedside table.
0:51:10|0:51:20|Carefully selecting a pair of earrings, [Qin Fen] interrupted her.
0:51:41|0:51:59|[Liang Xiaoxiao] smiled and put on two different styles of high-heeled sandals on her left and right feet. The urgent ringtone of her phone sounded, but she quickly turned it off. After tying her shoelaces, she looked at [Qin Fen]. While [Qin Fen] pointed at the shoe on her right foot, [Liang Xiaoxiao] did the opposite and immediately took off the shoe on her right foot, replacing it with the same one as her left foot.
0:51:59|0:52:4|The setting sun's afterglow spills over the stairs in the mountains,
0:52:11|0:52:18|[Qin Fen] still shook his head, [Liang Xiaoxiao] turned around and smiled, feeling the love from this guy.
0:52:18|0:52:30|So, [Liang Xiaoxiao] in front, wearing a beautiful long dress, [Qin Fen] behind, wearing sunglasses and a hat, the two walked onto the long bridge. When they reached the center of the bridge, [Qin Fen] stopped.
0:52:30|0:52:35|[Liang Xiaoxiao] walked confidently towards the other end. The beauty pageant at night was filled with dazzling fireworks.
0:52:41|0:52:45|The noisy music, colorful fireworks, and lively crowd.
0:52:45|0:52:50|On the big screen appeared a pair of huge angel wings, with five big characters suddenly flashing: "Angels at the Emmys."
0:52:50|0:52:55|A group of photographers gathered in the audience, with distinguished guests, showcasing the grandeur of the evening gala.
0:53:42|0:53:55|The [Host] was the first to leave the stage. With the music playing, the audience's emotions were immediately stirred up. The beauty who appeared on the left was dressed boldly, with the overall look tied together with ribbons into a bow, only covering the important parts of her body.
0:53:56|0:54:7|Soon, the V-shaped stage was filled with slender and plump beauties. On the other side, [Qin Fen] dived into the pool, with the night pool shimmering on the mountaintop. Before long, [Qin Fen] returned to the bedroom.
0:54:7|0:54:14|Watching the live broadcast of the beauty pageant on TV.
0:54:50|0:55:0|At the scene, the beauties changed into new outfits and walked onto the stage again. In the audience, Liang Xiaoxiao's phone rang, and she saw that it was Qin Fen calling, thinking that something urgent must have happened.
0:55:10|0:55:18|Perhaps she was hoping that [Qin Fen] would also come to the scene to accompany her, and not long after, [Qin Fen] drove over. The car stopped at the hotel entrance.
0:55:18|0:55:36|[Qin Fen] entered and dialed the phone, found a waiter to inquire, by the pool, the girls were dressed boldly.
0:55:36|0:55:47|They held champagne and swayed around the pool. Sexy models swam in the pool, while the bar was filled with helium balloons. Under the spotlight, the enthusiastic crowd looked strange.
0:55:47|0:55:56|His behavior became more bizarre. [Qin Fen] looked around, sizing up, but still didn't see [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s figure. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Jian Guo appeared.
0:55:56|0:56:4|From behind, [Liang Xiaoxiao] firmly pinched Qin Fen's buttocks. He, drunk, held a glass of wine and urged Qin Fen to have some too, while in a certain restroom,
0:56:5|0:56:13|[Liang Xiaoxiao] is lying in front of the pool vomiting, being taken care of by the host. At this moment, [Qin Fen] happens to walk in through the door.
0:56:14|0:56:15|He closed the door and walked in to question.
0:56:24|0:56:28|[Liang Xiaoxiao] didn't speak clearly in one sentence, and started to vomit again.
0:56:41|0:56:56|The host walked out of the bathroom, and [Qin Fen] stepped forward to pat [Liang Xiaoxiao] on the back. The host came back with a blanket and gave some advice. It was only now that [Liang Xiaoxiao] recovered, sitting against the wall on the ground.
0:57:2|0:57:10|[Qin Fen] stood still in front of her, looking at his beloved girl in such a state, feeling more heartache than anger. He squatted down beside [Liang Xiaoxiao],
0:57:11|0:57:17|Saying that, he reached out to tidy up [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s hair, and [Liang Xiaoxiao] was panting.
0:57:17|0:57:26|[Qin Fen] gently tidied her hair, while [Liang Xiaoxiao] pushed away [Qin Fen]'s hand.
0:57:30|0:57:41|[Liang Xiaoxiao] buried her head in her knees in agony, she adjusted her state and said, [Qin Fen] still knelt on one knee, unmoved.
0:57:49|0:57:59|[Liang Xiaoxiao] reluctantly picked up the wine glass and plunged back into the crowd, continuing the revelry.
0:57:59|0:58:6|She staggered and bumped into passersby one after another, but her unsteady steps still managed to find the place to drink.
0:58:6|0:58:12|She handed the cup to the bartender for a refill, then dove back into the crowd. Her hair was loose, and she tilted her head back to drink it down.
0:58:14|0:58:23|Finally, [Qin Fen] rushed forward and snatched the wine glass from her hand, grabbing her arm with one hand, while [Liang Xiaoxiao] kicked off her sandals and threw them into the pool.
0:58:24|0:58:30|[Qin Fen] was about to fish out the shoes, but [Liang Xiaoxiao] once again dove into the crowd. [Qin Fen] had no choice but to first retrieve the shoes from the pool.
0:58:30|0:58:35|These shoes were chosen by [Liang Xiaoxiao] before going out, they must be her favorite pair.
0:58:36|0:58:43|The celebration party seemed to have ended, but [Liang Xiaoxiao] was nowhere to be found. [Qin Fen] arrived at the beach,
0:58:44|0:58:50|In a rush, he shouted towards the sea in desperation, as the cool seawater flowed over Qin Fen's sandals in the night.
0:58:56|0:59:6|[Qin Fen] followed the sound and, after searching with his eyes, finally spotted [Liang Xiaoxiao] barefoot on the beach not far away. He immediately walked briskly towards that direction.
0:59:7|0:59:18|Approaching, [Qin Fen] finally saw [Liang Xiaoxiao] sitting on the ground, hugging her knees, with disheveled hair covering her face. [Qin Fen] still couldn't be sure until he got closer and bent down to take a closer look.
0:59:18|0:59:26|The weather is getting cooler, unfortunately it's a cloudy day. On the same gloomy sea surface, a figure is drifting towards this side.
0:59:26|0:59:30|It turns out to be [Liang Xiaoxiao], drifting towards the beach with the waves.
0:59:31|0:59:43|On the beach, only [Qin Fen] stood alone, his lonely figure somewhat desolate. Approaching the shore, [Liang Xiaoxiao] walked towards [Qin Fen], with wet clothes and messy hair clinging to her body.
0:59:43|0:59:52|She walked barefoot on the beach step by step towards [Qin Fen], all emotions and tumultuous thoughts completely emptied at this moment.
0:59:52|0:59:57|She sat across from [Qin Fen], and after a moment of silence, [Liang Xiaoxiao] spoke first,
1:1:12|1:1:16|[Liang Xiaoxiao] gazed at [Qin Fen],
1:1:20|1:1:36|There was an indescribable taste in her eyes, and the seawater on her hair dripped down the ends. [Qin Fen] slowly stood up, ignoring [Liang Xiaoxiao], and left without helping her with her shoes.
1:1:39|1:1:46|In the end, leaving behind these words, also leaving [Liang Xiaoxiao] sitting alone on the beach. Inside the house, [Liang Xiaoxiao] woke up.
1:1:46|1:1:50|Still in the same outfit with messy hair. She climbed up from the sofa,
1:1:50|1:1:58|She walked barefoot on the floor for a few steps and felt a sharp pain under her feet. Leaning against the wall, she lifted her foot and took a closer look.
1:1:59|1:2:7|The soles of her feet were covered in cuts, touching them with her hands was excruciatingly painful, so she had to use her toes to take a shower.
1:2:7|1:2:18|Just as she rushed out of the bedroom, Liang Xiaoxiao saw the sunlight streaming onto the balcony, with [Qin Fen] sitting on a stool, using a hairdryer to blow dry her shoes. She was a bit stunned by this sight.
1:2:18|1:2:25|[Qin Fen] didn't find [Liang Xiaoxiao] getting up, still blowing his sandals seriously on his own. Seeing this scene, [Liang Xiaoxiao] felt a little guilty.
1:2:28|1:2:35|She tiptoed into the bathroom, brushing her teeth while taking a shower. The seawater wasn't as clean as the swimming pool, otherwise she wouldn't have cut her foot.
1:2:36|1:2:43|She grabbed her hair, unbuttoned her clothes, and let her dress slide down to her feet. With a kick of her foot, it landed perfectly on the toilet seat.
1:2:43|1:2:53|In the summer, dark clouds quickly gathered over the mountain top, and the thunder rumbled.
1:2:53|1:3:1|[Liang Xiaoxiao] put on a comfortable nightgown and limped through the bedroom. He saw [Qin Fen] lounging comfortably on the sofa in the living room.
1:3:1|1:3:8|She staggered forward on her own and stood next to [Qin Fen]. [Qin Fen] didn't say anything, just looked at her coldly.
1:3:8|1:3:17|[Liang Xiaoxiao] simply folded the nightgown and sat on the coffee table. She looked at [Qin Fen], who was also looking at her askance, and the two of them remained in a stalemate for a while.
1:3:19|1:3:34|[Liang Xiaoxiao] lifted her foot onto [Qin Fen]'s body. [Qin Fen] held her injured foot tenderly and said, [Liang Xiaoxiao] put her foot down and stared at [Qin Fen]. The atmosphere of the conversation once again fell into an icy silence.
1:3:34|1:3:43|Outside the window, rain started falling timely. [Qin Fen] remained indifferent, but [Liang Xiaoxiao] couldn't take it anymore. She grabbed the cushion on the sofa and threw it aside.
1:3:43|1:3:52|[Qin Fen] moved over a bit, and [Liang Xiaoxiao] lay down beside [Qin Fen]. She held [Qin Fen]'s hand, wrapped it around her neck, this was the first time the two had been so intimate.
1:3:52|1:4:0|[Liang Xiaoxiao] wrapped her arms around [Qin Fen], fully aware of her actions and feeling guilty for hurting this man.
1:4:0|1:4:4|[Liang Xiaoxiao] comforts [Qin Fen], as if comforting herself,
1:4:14|1:4:20|Finally, she couldn't hold it anymore, sadness and joy playing out on her face, she controlled the corners of her mouth.
1:4:22|1:4:35|[Liang Xiaoxiao] gave a bitter smile and took a bite at [Qin Fen], who didn't dodge. At this moment, he could still pamper [Liang Xiaoxiao].
1:4:36|1:4:45|[Liang Xiaoxiao] vented her frustrations and tears streamed down her face, but she still managed to force a smile.
1:5:4|1:5:9|She frowned, her eyes red and teary, knowing she couldn't let go.
1:5:18|1:5:37|In the end, [Qin Fen] couldn't bear to make her angry. [Liang Xiaoxiao] pondered [Qin Fen]'s words, then turned around and threw herself into [Qin Fen]'s arms. [Qin Fen] gently embraced her.
1:5:37|1:5:47|[Qin Fen] at this moment, his inner peace was extraordinary. When he accepted the affection on the beach, he knew the outcome would be like this.
1:6:11|1:6:29|The ceiling fan was gently turning, and the people under the fan were leaning against each other. Outside the window, it was raining heavily at the moment, as if filling the dialogue between the two. The rain fell on the balcony, on the trees, and also on the beautiful wooden staircase. It was unknown how long the rain had been falling, and [Liang Xiaoxiao] didn't know how long she had been asleep.
1:6:29|1:6:44|She woke up groggily from the bed, realizing she was half-naked. She recalled the scene again, remembering that she cried herself to sleep. Of course, waking up in bed was not surprising, Liang Xiaoxiao was already used to the feeling of being taken care of by him.
1:6:44|1:6:53|[Liang Xiaoxiao] propped herself up and got out of bed, wrapping herself in a blanket as she moved towards the edge of the bed. As soon as her feet touched the ground, she felt something was off.
1:6:53|1:6:59|She lifted her foot to inspect, all the wounds on the sole of her foot were tightly wrapped in band-aids.
1:6:59|1:7:4|[Liang Xiaoxiao] looked up and couldn't find her clothes, so she simply wrapped herself in the quilt like a bathrobe and got out of bed.
1:7:7|1:7:13|She walked unsteadily into the empty living room, the long quilt dragging on the floor, resembling a skirt.
1:7:13|1:7:22|With her hair scattered, she looked like a goddess descended from ancient Roman mythology. She sat on the sofa chair, looking around for [Qin Fen] who was nowhere to be seen.
1:7:22|1:7:29|Suddenly, she caught sight of a glaring white paper on the table next to her, and somehow she already knew what was written on it.
1:7:30|1:7:37|She still stepped forward to pick up the piece of paper, which was the letter left by [Qin Fen], and she began to read it carefully.
1:8:2|1:8:10|[Liang Xiaoxiao] saw this, turned around, sat on the ground, hugged her knees, and looked out the window in a daze.
1:8:56|1:9:17|The pilot pushed the control stick, and the plane smoothly took off, soaring in the sky above the mountains and rivers. The plane flew through the clouds, and even the sun obscured by the clouds still shone brightly.
1:9:17|1:9:28|Near the plane, if you look closely, you will easily spot the beautiful figure of [Liang Xiaoxiao] in front of the airplane window. At this moment, she is calmly resting her chin on her hand, looking out the window with a hint of melancholy.
1:9:28|1:9:39|The plane glides over the clouds, heading towards the distant glittering lights.
1:11:24|1:11:32|[Liang Xiaoxiao] sat in the airport shuttle bus with a melancholy expression, watching the program being broadcast on the bus. She couldn't help but miss that person.
1:11:32|1:11:38|In the company's lounge area, Xuan Xuan and [Qin Fen] sit on either side, while [Li Xiangshan] in the middle looks at the photos on the screen and says,
1:13:28|1:13:34|Xuan Xuan, on the side, felt puzzled as Qin Fen held a cup of coffee and looked at Li Xiangshan, who stood up uncomfortably.
1:13:48|1:14:4|[Qin Fen] stared at [Li Xiangshan] and asked seriously. Xuan Xuan looked surprised, but without hesitation, she closed her notebook, picked up her laptop, and left.
1:14:7|1:14:16|This is said to Xuan Xuan, but also for [Qin Fen] to hear. Xuan Xuan humbly accepts it and quickly runs away.
1:14:16|1:14:31|Li Xiangshan returned to the sofa. In the afternoon, a mini car drove into the Beijing Fashion Design Square, with two people on the car, formally Mango and Liang Xiaoxiao.
1:14:31|1:14:41|At this time before the end of the workday, pedestrians and traffic were sparse. The two people who returned to the same city naturally had to meet up. The car took the two of them straight to the hotel they had booked.
1:14:42|1:14:51|The weather in Beijing is not as warm as in Sanya. Unlike the last time they met, this time both of them are wearing long pants. However, even so, it is difficult to hide the radiance of the two beautiful women walking together.
1:14:59|1:15:5|They placed their bags on the empty chair next to them and took a seat. The waiter brought menus to them separately.
1:15:7|1:15:15|Mango looked through the papers with a hint of displeasure, then suddenly spoke up.
1:15:25|1:15:43|Night falls, and the city's nightlife begins. Amid enthusiastic cheers, the young talents step out of their luxury cars, waving and posing for the cameras.
1:15:43|1:15:52|The enthusiastic cheers greeted their entrance. Various luxury cars came to a stop one after another at the charity gala titled "Melting Glacier, Earth's Demise".
1:15:52|1:15:59|It's another grand stage of fame and fortune, and the last car to arrive, a low-key black Mercedes, carries [Li Xiangshan] and [Qin Fen].
1:15:59|1:16:8|[Qin Fen] is a bit nervous in this kind of occasion, compared to [Li Xiangshan] who is much more familiar. He puts his arm around [Qin Fen]'s shoulder, and the two of them walk into the venue arm in arm.
1:17:14|1:17:22|A bottle of wine was sold for 500,000 yuan, and a beautiful woman named Xinyu walked across the red carpet amidst applause, presenting foreign liquor, and then hugged [Li Xiangshan].
1:17:31|1:17:37|Xiangshan helplessly glanced at [Qin Fen].
1:18:13|1:18:29|[Mango] picked up the ring and carefully examined the diamond symbolizing love, then handed the diamond back to [Liang Xiaoxiao].
1:19:1|1:19:22|[Liang Xiaoxiao] waited for the next part, thinking about all this made [Liang Xiaoxiao] have a headache. She messed up her hair in frustration, which amused [Mango].
1:19:28|1:19:35|And at this moment, the Mercedes-Benz stopped at the hotel entrance. As fate would have it, [Li Xiangshan] and [Qin Fen] also arrived at this place.
1:19:35|1:19:42|Perhaps this was a place they used to frequent together before they parted ways. The restaurant was packed during peak dining hours.
1:19:43|1:19:51|The waiter led the way, and the two of them arrived at a table outdoors. Sitting just inside the wall was [Mango] and [Liang Xiaoxiao].
1:19:51|1:19:54|No one noticed anyone. The waiter brought the menu.
1:20:10|1:20:14|After speaking, [Li Xiangshan] eagerly uncorked the bottle of expensive wine.
1:20:14|1:20:25|He poured himself a drink, raised the cup to his lips and gulped it down. With a satisfied expression, he nodded and said,
1:20:31|1:20:34|Li Xiangshan focused on pouring the wine without saying a word.
1:20:34|1:20:42|After two glasses were filled, he put down the glass and sat back, sipping and looking at [Qin Fen].
1:20:43|1:20:56|[Qin Fen] stared in astonishment, while [Li Xiangshan] took off his shoes and pulled down his socks. There was a piece of gauze wrapped around the top of his foot, and [Li Xiangshan] carefully uncovered it to reveal a huge black mole, about the size of a one yuan coin.
1:20:56|1:21:7|He stepped on Qin Fen's chair, and when Qin Fen didn't understand, Li Xiangshan explained,
1:21:8|1:21:16|[Qin Fen] shook his head. At this point, [Li Xiangshan] actually laughed, and only then did [Qin Fen] cautiously look over.
1:21:27|1:21:35|[Li Xiangshan] smiled helplessly and rewrapped the gauze. [Qin Fen] just watched him quietly, digesting the bad news brought by [Li Xiangshan].
1:21:49|1:21:58|[Li Xiangshan] calmly raised his glass, while [Qin Fen] widened his eyes in anxiety. [Li Xiangshan] smiled calmly.
1:22:16|1:22:22|[Qin Fen] still can't let go, while everyone else is thinking about how to live, this person is thinking about how to die.
1:22:35|1:22:41|After speaking, [Qin Fen] picked up the glass of wine in front of him and drank it all in one gulp.
1:22:42|1:22:53|The strong liquor burned his throat, and [Qin Fen] let out a breath. Accepting the situation, [Qin Fen] turned to [Li Xiangshan] and asked,
1:22:59|1:23:4|Li Xiangshan waited for this line, and he sat up with a smile on his face.
1:23:32|1:23:39|Li Xiangshan laughed again when he mentioned this, pursing his lips as he reminisced.
1:24:1|1:24:13|Upon hearing this, [Li Xiangshan]’s expression changed, and he stared at [Qin Fen] with displeasure, not speaking for a while. After a moment, he lowered his head in contemplation. [Qin Fen] looked at [Li Xiangshan] nervously, afraid that [Li Xiangshan] would regret it for the rest of his life.
1:24:13|1:24:20|For the father, the words "daughter" are too deadly.
1:24:40|1:24:48|But thinking of his daughter being so young, the father couldn't help but cry, [Li Xiangshan] furrowed his brow and adjusted his emotions for a long time.
1:25:22|1:25:38|[Qin Fen] had a hint of tears in his eyes. He forced a smile and [Li Xiangshan] continued speaking with pursed lips.
1:25:42|1:25:50|It was late at night outside the hotel, where two pairs of old friends upstairs were drinking until the wee hours.
1:25:51|1:25:58|The waiter handed over the bill, and [Mango] glanced at it before handing her card to the waiter on the shelf.
1:26:4|1:26:9|[Liang Xiaoxiao] walked towards the bathroom, and trouble followed her.
1:26:13|1:26:22|Just as [Liang Xiaoxiao] was about to push the door open, she suddenly heard a noise. She saw a man slumped next to the sink, and his shiny bald head immediately caught her attention.
1:26:22|1:26:31|[Liang Xiaoxiao] walked forward slowly, looking at [Qin Fen] with a mix of disbelief and confirmation, then softly asked, as [Qin Fen] groggily raised his head.
1:26:31|1:26:37|He focused on the person in front of him and muttered something under his breath.
1:26:38|1:26:44|He staggered and raised his hand, resting it on [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s shoulder.
1:26:44|1:26:53|Liang Xiaoxiao was completely confused by what was said.
1:26:53|1:27:6|He then lifted up the hand holding Liang Xiaoxiao.
1:27:38|1:27:50|Outside, [Mango] took the bank card handed by the waiter and packed up their bags. At the same time, sitting outside, [Li Xiangshan] finished the last drop of wine. He looked around and didn't see any sign of [Qin Fen], so he got up from his chair.
1:27:50|1:28:1|Staggering towards the hotel, he happened to pass by [Mango] rummaging through her bag and didn't notice.
1:28:1|1:28:10|Mango lowered her head to organize her bag, without noticing Li Xiangshan. Li Xiangshan stood still, looking around, and signaled the waiter to find Qin Fen.
1:28:12|1:28:19|Mango recognized his voice, Li Xiangshan stopped in his tracks, Mango smiled and approached.
1:28:29|1:28:48|[Li Xiangshan] looked dazed, his smile even brighter, the familiar greetings exchanged. [Mango] gazed at him with a smile, the two standing face to face, when suddenly [Li Xiangshan] embraced [Mango].
1:28:50|1:29:0|The scene shifts to a nightclub, where young people are dancing to a lively rhythm, bathed in colorful lights. They sway their bodies, immersed in it, vigorously releasing their hormones.
1:29:0|1:29:13|On the colorful sofa next to the big screen, sat four people. [Li Xiangshan] sat upright, [Mango] had his arm around him, while [Qin Fen] was lying on the sofa, using [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s leg as a pillow. The four of them had no expression on their faces, looking out of place amidst the lively atmosphere around them.
1:29:13|1:29:21|[Li Xiangshan] stood still like a painting, while [Qin Fen] had already fallen asleep with his arms crossed. The others portrayed the attitude of turning a deaf ear to perfection.
1:29:21|1:29:25|Life is like a feast, no matter how lively it is, there will be a day when it disperses.
1:29:26|1:29:34|At dawn, with just a hint of sunlight on the horizon, the VIP room of the luxurious KTV was filled with all kinds of exotic and strange drinks on the bar counter.
1:29:34|1:29:40|The place that should have been lively appeared unusually quiet, the 100-square-meter private room was empty.
1:29:40|1:29:45|The huge tatami mat looked lonely. And [Qin Fen] was still sleeping on [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s lap.
1:29:45|1:29:51|[Liang Xiaoxiao] is propping up her arms, quietly accompanying him. Getting drunk again, staying up all night.
1:29:51|1:29:57|This kind of gameplay is too much for young people to handle. Perhaps feeling uncomfortable in his position, [Qin Fen] moved his head a bit and woke up.
1:29:58|1:30:13|[Liang Xiaoxiao] immediately noticed that [Qin Fen] shook his head and looked around, saying,
1:30:20|1:30:23|At this point, [Qin Fen] propped himself up.
1:30:23|1:30:30|After all, they have separated, and neither wants to owe each other anymore. [Qin Fen] rubs his head with both hands.
1:30:46|1:30:53|The two were more polite than ordinary friends, although they were sitting on a sofa, there was enough space in the middle for two more people.
1:30:53|1:30:59|[Qin Fen] didn't realize that he still had a ring on his finger, the one he used to propose on the Great Wall.
1:30:59|1:31:6|He took off the ring, looked at it for a while before speaking,
1:31:8|1:31:16|[Liang Xiaoxiao] didn't answer the question, she relaxed on the sofa and stretched lazily.
1:31:28|1:31:46|[Qin Fen] still holding the ring tightly, [Liang Xiaoxiao] turned her head and reached out to hold [Qin Fen]'s hand. Only then did [Qin Fen] let go of the ring, and their fingers intertwined.
1:32:45|1:32:56|Above the cemetery, with a light rain falling, [Qin Fen] holds an umbrella and follows behind [Li Xiangshan]. [Li Xiangshan] stops in his tracks, hands in his pockets, and says,
1:33:52|1:33:55|[Li Xiangshan] smiled wearily and looked at [Qin Fen].
1:33:59|1:34:6|At this point, Li Xiangshan didn't care anymore. He sat shakily on the wet stone pillar, just trying to feel better.
1:34:6|1:34:15|Then she took [Qin Fen]'s hand with both hands, leaned her whole body towards him, her head against his belly, looking extremely weak.
1:34:17|1:34:25|The two sentences seemed to have drained him of all his energy.
1:34:31|1:34:40|His health is deteriorating, he has to take three breaths after saying a sentence.
1:34:42|1:34:50|Li Xiangshan didn't bother to lift his head, just clung to Qin Fen's arm and said, Qin Fen vaguely understood what he meant.
1:34:52|1:34:58|Li Xiangshan's gloomy eyes suddenly lit up, he struggled to sit up and looked straight at Qin Fen.
1:34:58|1:35:6|[Qin Fen] holds an umbrella, pressing his shoulder with one hand, and the two of them gaze at each other in the rain.
1:35:10|1:35:17|[Qin Fen] looks a bit comical with a hat on and holding an umbrella.
1:35:20|1:35:24|While he still could move, [Qin Fen] fulfilled his promise and took [Li Xiangshan] to Sanya.
1:35:24|1:35:34|That day, at the airport in Sanya, [Liang Xiaoxiao] had just gotten off the plane and was walking over with his luggage. A Japanese man pulling a suitcase passed in front of him and apologized.
1:35:35|1:35:42|[Liang Xiaoxiao] glanced in surprise, the hurried passerby seemed somewhat familiar, and she quickly caught up.
1:36:0|1:36:8|The sharp rhetorical question made [Liang Xiaoxiao] look away, at that moment she realized she couldn't even count as an acquaintance.
1:36:8|1:36:15|The so-called "business without friendship is not a real business" can only be done by those who have never loved. It started raining heavily at the memorial service.
1:36:15|1:36:21|In the memorial hall, the guests have already taken their seats, with a poster of [Li Xiangshan] hanging on one wall, along with some monologues.
1:36:21|1:36:28|The long table in front of the poster is filled with flowers, and there are two to three dozen guests sitting below, fanning themselves with folding fans.
1:36:28|1:36:33|[Qin Fen] walked onto the stage, leaned against the bench, with his back to the audience, and looked at the poster by himself.
1:36:33|1:36:40|He adjusted his emotions, turned around, took off his baseball cap, and looked relaxedly at the audience below the stage before saying,
1:37:59|1:38:4|Li Xiangshan listened, tears shimmering in her eyes.
1:38:7|1:38:14|Upon hearing this, [Chuan Chuan] couldn't help but feel a pang in her nose.
1:38:25|1:38:29|[Chuan Chuan] glared at him with tears in her eyes, while [Qin Fen] nodded and smiled.
1:38:38|1:38:52|A gentle breeze blows, the candles flicker, and [Li Xiangshan] holds his daughter's hand in his palm.
1:39:14|1:39:16|Li Xiangshan smiled and said with relief,
1:39:17|1:39:26|At the entrance, a sign reads "Farewell Party for [Li Xiangshan]" and reflects a military man getting out of an off-road vehicle.
1:39:26|1:39:36|He hurriedly walked around to the passenger side with an umbrella, opened the door, and embraced [Mango] as they walked towards this side. [Qin Fen], who had been waiting at the door for a long time, watched the two of them approaching quickly.
1:39:36|1:39:43|[Mango] held a bouquet of flowers in her arms, approached and gave [Qin Fen] a big hug, while her navy boyfriend was busy collecting the umbrella.
1:39:43|1:39:50|Mango was sobbing on Qin Fen's shoulder. In the memorial hall,
1:40:13|1:40:21|Wu Sang gets out of the taxi and Qin Fen quickly holds an umbrella for her.
1:40:36|1:40:41|[Wu Sang] slung her bag over her shoulder and walked towards the inside, while [Qin Fen] looked at the drenched [Liang Xiaoxiao] and couldn't speak for a while.
1:40:54|1:41:4|[Qin Fen] patted [Liang Xiaoxiao] on the shoulder and said, then he gently held [Liang Xiaoxiao] and opened the umbrella, taking steps towards the inside.
1:42:12|1:42:17|Mango seemed a bit moved.
1:44:18|1:44:24|Hearing this, everyone in the audience couldn't help but be moved to tears, with [Wu Sang] gently embracing [Chuan Chuan].
1:44:41|1:44:49|[Chuan Chuan] timidly looked at her father, while [Liang Xiaoxiao] in the audience wiped her nose with red eyes, tears streaming down her cheeks.
1:45:34|1:45:40|The crowd here looked even more desolate upon hearing this, lowering their heads involuntarily. [Mango] covered her face and wept.
1:45:57|1:46:8|In the past, everything is just a prologue. As the farewell ceremony entered its final stage, the guests raised their glasses, set aside their bouquets, and bid farewell to [Li Xiangshan]. The man with thinning hair.
1:46:8|1:46:12|Whispering in Li Xiangshan's ear, Li Xiangshan responded earnestly.
1:46:18|1:46:26|Next, the woman subordinate is here to offer a toast.
1:46:32|1:46:37|Xuan Xuan then squatted down next to [Li Xiangshan] with a glass of wine.
1:46:56|1:47:1|Xuan Xuan tried hard to hold back tears as she clinked glasses with [Li Xiangshan].
1:47:3|1:47:9|She took a sip, stood up reluctantly and left. Just as Liang Xiaoxiao left, Mango walked over.
1:47:9|1:47:15|Following [Mango]'s new boyfriend. [Mango] gently held [Li Xiangshan] with one hand and ruffled his hair with the other.
1:47:15|1:47:23|[Li Xiangshan] held her cold hand and pressed it against her own forehead.
1:47:35|1:47:42|[Li Xiangshan] held [Li Jianqiang]'s hand with relief, looking at him. [Li Jianqiang] answered firmly,
1:47:56|1:48:2|Saying that, [Li Xiangshan] patted [Li Jianqiang]'s back of the hand and instructed. [Li Jianqiang] firmly squeezed his hand.
1:48:2|1:48:9|Give the time to [Mango], [Mango] squats down, [Li Xiangshan] adjusts the sitting posture with force.
1:48:38|1:48:41|Saying that, [Li Xiangshan] reached out to wipe the tears from [Mango]'s face.
1:48:41|1:48:50|Mango couldn't help but bury her head in Li Xiangshan's arms and cry, while Chuan Chuan turned away. Qin Fen then walked up and interrupted.
1:48:54|1:49:0|Mango stood up to make room, and Li Xiangshan tried hard to shake hands with Liang Xiaoxiao.
1:49:4|1:49:9|Mango glanced at Qin Fen beside her.
1:50:3|1:50:11|At this point, both Liang Xiaoxiao and Wu Sang were in tears, with Chuan Chuan crying bitterly on the wheelchair.
1:50:15|1:50:30|[Chuan Chuan] wiped away a tear, looked up at [Li Xiangshan]. [Liang Xiaoxiao] quickly pushed [Qin Fen] away.
1:50:30|1:50:39|Leave the last moments to this father and daughter, holding hands tightly. The audience below sat quietly,
1:51:41|1:51:51|[Chuan Chuan] leaned on her father's shoulder, while [Li Xiangshan] gently kissed her forehead.
1:51:51|1:52:2|In the afternoon, the harbor was filled with ships, and the setting sun cast a golden edge on the sea. An old fishing boat slowly sailed out towards the distance. It was around dusk,
1:52:2|1:52:10|The fishing boat arrived at a quiet sea, sailing quietly, carrying a person's life towards the end.
1:52:16|1:52:24|On the deck, [Li Xiangshan] was wearing a scarf, looking calmly at the sea, while [Qin Fen] remained the same, standing behind the wheelchair holding an umbrella.
1:52:24|1:52:39|The vast sea, where the water meets the sky in the distance, a small fishing boat, just a drop in the ocean, besides being tiny, there is nothing left but insignificance. [Li Xiangshan] hung his head, squinting at the sea, looking particularly peaceful.
1:52:46|1:52:56|He spoke like a gloomy old man, [Qin Fen] lowered his head to look at him, gently placing his hand on his shoulder, [Li Xiangshan] struggled to raise his hand, lightly patting [Qin Fen]'s back.
1:52:56|1:53:2|[Qin Fen] folded up the umbrella and pushed the wheelchair towards the cabin. He could only accompany her this far.
1:53:7|1:53:13|[Qin Fen] returned to the cabin absent-mindedly, looking out the window with his hand tightly gripping the railing.
1:53:15|1:53:21|Li Xiangshan jumped into the sea, while Qin Fen leaned his head against the window frame, hesitating to turn around for a long time.
1:53:21|1:53:32|His best friend ended his life like this, even though there were so many foreshadowings before. At this moment, he still couldn't let go in his heart. He felt like his soul had been taken away.
1:53:32|1:53:40|Staring blankly out the window, Liang Xiaoxiao's tightly clenched hand had turned slightly pale, the empty wheelchair on the deck telling the story of a life gone by.
1:53:40|1:53:44|As the saying goes, life is nothing but a spiritual journey.
1:53:44|1:53:51|In this long journey, all fame and money are irrelevant to you when death arrives.
1:53:51|1:53:58|And in acquiring these external possessions, all experiences will become a part of your soul.
1:53:58|1:54:11|No matter what kind of life script one experiences hardships and difficulties, it is rare to face the tribulations of this journey with a peaceful heart, perhaps this is the true essence of life.
1:54:12|1:54:21|This afternoon, the house in the mountains where [Qin Fen] lived was rejuvenated, with a breeze blowing through. Inside the house, [Chuan Chuan] was wiping the base of the new flowerpot that had just been moved in.
1:54:21|1:54:28|[Qin Fen] and [Liang Xiaoxiao] each carried a flowerpot, with a green spider plant inside the wooden pot.
1:54:28|1:54:33|The two of them worked together to place this thriving green ivy on the base. [Qin Fen] picked up the watering can and gently sprayed it.
1:54:33|1:54:40|[Chuan Chuan] picked up a vibrant leaf and sprayed water towards him. [Liang Xiaoxiao] was fixing [Chuan Chuan]'s hair and said,
1:54:42|1:54:58|Chuan Chuan pointed to her chest, Liang Xiaoxiao strolled and sat on the sofa, Qin Fen also put down the water bottle and walked to the window with his head down.
1:54:58|1:55:6|Three of them seemed to have their own thoughts. [Liang Xiaoxiao] on the sofa seemed to sense something, but she still chose to remain unchanged in the face of uncertainty.
1:55:6|1:55:14|[Qin Fen] leaned on the table, pondering. He hesitated, raised his hand to rub his eyes, hoping that his heart could calm down.
1:55:14|1:55:21|[Qin Fen] hesitated for a moment, but still opened the cabinet. He reached in and pulled out the diamond ring that had been returned by [Liang Xiaoxiao].
1:55:21|1:55:30|Finally, he turned around, his hands nervously rubbing the diamond ring. With determination, he looked towards [Chuan Chuan] standing beside him.
1:55:30|1:55:45|He whispered, and then [Qin Fen] glanced at [Liang Xiaoxiao] beside him, while [Liang Xiaoxiao], as if knowing the outcome in advance, waited quietly for [Qin Fen]'s next move.
1:55:45|1:55:51|Kneeling on one knee, [Qin Fen] raised the diamond ring in his hand and said to [Liang Xiaoxiao],
1:55:58|1:56:5|Just as he was about to put on the ring, [Liang Xiaoxiao] pulled back his hand discontentedly.
1:56:32|1:56:40|[Qin Fen] immediately smiled broadly, he excitedly stood up and planted a kiss on [Chuan Chuan]'s forehead.
1:56:42|1:56:49|[Qin Fen] takes [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s hand and puts a diamond ring on her finger.
1:56:49|1:56:56|The car drove on the winding mountain road, with lush trees adorning the journey.
1:57:32|1:57:37|In the back seat, [Chuan Chuan] saw the affection between the two and felt discontent. [Qin Fen] turned around and said,
1:57:40|1:57:53|After that, [Qin Fen] drove the car back on the journey home. This mountain road carries the joys and sorrows of the two, but fortunately, everything is now back on track. When it comes to love and marriage, both [Qin Fen] and [Liang Xiaoxiao],
1:57:53|1:57:58|There is a new understanding. In the tug of war of their destinies, all of these have once again come together.
1:57:58|1:58:7|The love-hate relationship belonging to [Qin Fen] comes to an end here.
