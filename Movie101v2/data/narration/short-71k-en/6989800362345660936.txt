0:2:20|0:2:29|In the city, tall buildings stand densely, with crowds of people flowing continuously.
0:2:29|0:2:43|At the traffic light intersection, a group of young people with blank expressions are standing. A girl with ear-length hair, wearing a smart suit and high heels, appears in the middle of the crowd. With a calm and confident expression on her face, she looks like she can conquer the world.
0:2:43|0:2:48|The girl, [Xiong Dun], is heading towards the crosswalk as the green light comes on and the crowd surges towards the intersection.
0:2:48|0:2:59|[Xiong Dun] walked calmly forward, reaching the center of the crossroads. Suddenly, she stopped, hesitated for a while, and then let out a big sneeze. The ground immediately cracked and collapsed downward.
0:3:7|0:3:19|On the ground, vehicles and crowds were suspended in mid-air due to inertia, with only [Xiong Dun] standing in the middle of the road. Like a superhero, she watched everything happening in front of her, feeling satisfied as she admired her masterpiece, a mischievous smile on her face.
0:3:19|0:3:23|She lowered her head, and the floating object fell down instantly, hitting the ground heavily.
0:3:23|0:3:31|She made a striking move towards the front. Following that, the title of the movie appeared. [Xiong Dun] maintained this posture, her thoughts pulled back to reality.
0:3:34|0:3:40|[Xiong Dun] snapped out of his daydream just now, standing in the middle of the road, bewildered and running around aimlessly.
0:3:45|0:3:53|[Xiong Dun] patted her head in frustration, standing still on the street. She looked around in embarrassment.
0:4:0|0:4:7|At this moment, a wedding is taking place in a church. The groom is looking at the bride walking slowly towards him, with a happy smile on his face.
0:4:23|0:4:37|The church door was pushed open by someone, and [Xiong Dun] cautiously walked in. The guests turned their heads to look at [Xiong Dun], whispering about this intruder. The bride and groom looked puzzled, clearly not recognizing [Xiong Dun], who just kept his head down and ran in.
0:4:37|0:4:45|Xiong Dun's boyfriend Xiao Chuan sat in the guest seat, looking at Xiong Dun running towards him with a look of despair. The priest, seeing this, breathed a sigh of relief and said.
0:5:23|0:5:29|[Xiong Dun] suddenly stared at the bride's shoulder. She spoke and then reached out to tear it directly.
0:5:37|0:5:44|Xiao Chuan dragged [Xiong Dun] by the arm expressionlessly to a table with desserts.
0:5:49|0:5:55|[Xiong Dun] picks up a cake and eats it while turning his head.
0:6:17|0:6:20|Xiong Dun had the cake pressed forcefully onto his mouth by Xiao Chuan, then she turned and left.
0:6:20|0:6:32|Not long after, [Xiong Dun] started drinking at the dining table. She propped up her drowsy head and looked around, seeing the table filled with empty wine glasses, at least a dozen of them. Overwhelmed by the alcohol, [Xiong Dun] soon got drunk.
0:7:29|0:7:33|[Lao Zheng] stands on the boxing ring, the audience below cheering and rooting for him. [Lao Zheng] easily dodges a punch and finally delivers a fatal blow to his opponent.
0:7:54|0:8:3|[Ai Mi] was scared by the monster in the movie, she screamed and quickly dropped what she was holding, covering her eyes.
0:8:12|0:8:17|[Ai Mi] looked at her colleague who was being scolded by the boss, taking a deep breath in shock.
0:9:2|0:9:11|[Ai Mi] sat on the sofa, looking at [Xiong Dun] with a helpless expression. A whole night had passed, [Xiong Dun] was still wearing the same clothes from yesterday, with messy hair.
0:9:11|0:9:17|Her head was against the wall, sleeping soundly. She struggled to open her eyes and found herself sitting on the toilet, still holding a plastic bucket.
0:9:17|0:9:24|She then got up to wash up, splashing cold water on her face. Just as she lifted her head, [Ai Mi] suddenly appeared behind her.
0:9:36|0:9:42|Xiong Dun's boss was touching up her makeup while getting angry. Xiong Dun kept his head down, doodling on a notebook.
0:10:22|0:10:26|[Xiong Dun] angrily tried to flip the table, but the conference table remained unmoved.
0:10:26|0:10:33|Colleagues around couldn't help but cover their mouths and chuckle, leaving the boss speechless with anger. [Xiong Dun] felt extremely embarrassed, kicked the chair away, and walked out.
0:10:38|0:10:43|Halfway there, [Xiong Dun] suddenly stopped, a wicked expression on her face. She licked her thumb and headed straight for her boss.
0:10:43|0:10:52|She grabbed her boss's chin and rubbed it hard. A mole suddenly appeared on the boss's chin, looking around in panic. [Xiong Dun] smirked, satisfied, and turned away.
0:10:54|0:11:9|[Xiong Dun] ordered a table full of delicious food, eating the meat in her hands hungrily, trying to forget about the shadow of losing her job. Suddenly, her boyfriend [Xiao Xia] appeared at the entrance of the restaurant.
0:11:21|0:11:29|Xiong Dun, who was still in a daze, suddenly panicked. She dropped the bone in her hand, grabbed her bag, and ran off. After running a few steps, she realized she had forgotten her phone.
0:11:31|0:11:39|[Xiong Dun] had nowhere to go, so he simply hid under the table. The waiter took away the unfinished meal of [Xiong Dun].
0:11:39|0:11:46|The girl took the menu handed by Xiao Chuan and flipped through it. [Xiong Dun] suddenly realized that her scarf was still on the bench, so she reached out to grab it.
0:11:47|0:11:54|She quickly pulled the scarf over and accidentally touched the girl's leg.
0:12:9|0:12:13|Xiong Dun's phone ringtone gave away her location, causing her to panic for a moment.
0:12:23|0:12:30|[Xiong Dun] lifted the table over her head, blocking her face, not wanting to be discovered. She frantically felt for the direction, trying to escape forward, only to be blocked by the glass door.
0:12:30|0:12:32|The table was hit and fell to the ground.
0:12:32|0:12:40|[Xiong Dun] rushed out of the door, with Xiaochuan anxiously calling out to her from behind. However, no matter how Xiaochuan shouted, [Xiong Dun] refused to look back.
0:12:40|0:12:46|She flicked the scarf around her neck backwards, pretending to stride forward carefreely, while her mood plummeted.
0:12:46|0:12:54|The cold atmosphere turned the surrounding environment into a snowy landscape. The tall buildings around her world were gradually surrounded by ice.
0:12:54|0:13:2|The trash cans and fire hydrants on the roadside were not spared. The billboards on the tall buildings all turned into photos of Xiao Chuan and [Xiong Dun], and in the end, they were slowly engulfed by the ice.
0:13:2|0:13:9|A boy skateboarding past [Xiong Dun] suddenly freezes into a sculpture suspended in mid-air.
0:13:9|0:13:16|The inside of the mall was already a snowy world, with shoppers gradually being wrapped in ice. A newspaper was blown by the wind and flew past from the side.
0:13:16|0:13:22|Passing by [Xiong Dun], a photo of him and Xiao Chuan printed on it. Instantly frozen in place.
0:13:22|0:13:28|A person fell on the street, their coffee and newspaper flying out of their hands, but frozen in place by ice at the roadside.
0:13:28|0:13:34|[Xiong Dun] walked forward like an Ice Queen, freezing everything around her slowly.
0:13:34|0:13:49|The ice crackled, [Xiong Dun] stopped, her face expressionless. She looked up and saw the buildings around her covered in snow, the sky turned cold grey. The path she walked on instantly turned into ice.
0:13:49|0:13:58|At that moment, the whole world was frozen. [Xiong Dun], who was unemployed and heartbroken, felt just like this cold icy world.
0:13:58|0:14:4|At night, Xiong Dun did not return home.
0:14:16|0:14:20|[Xiong Dun] sat on a bench by the street, listening to the voices of his friends.
0:14:20|0:14:28|With a pout and red eyes full of grievances, she stubbornly held back her tears. At that moment, her phone rang. She lowered her head to see it was a call from her mother.
0:14:28|0:14:37|She placed her hand on the receiver button and took a deep breath.
0:15:34|0:15:42|[Xiong Dun] didn't want to worry his parents, so he lied without a trace. After hanging up the phone, the suspended heart also relaxed. As night fell,
0:15:42|0:15:51|The shops behind [Xiong Dun] lit up with lights, bustling with people, casting a contrast to [Xiong Dun]'s lonely figure. She sighed and swallowed back her sadness.
0:15:51|0:15:56|The scene cuts to [Xiong Dun] stepping out of the elevator, looking down to fish out his keys while glancing towards the door.
0:15:56|0:16:3|A sticky note on the door reads "Meet at the usual place." When she returned home, the lights suddenly turned on.
0:16:35|0:16:44|In front of [Xiong Dun] was a dartboard with a photo of Xiao Chuan on it. She turned around and glared at the three people, asking.
0:16:58|0:17:3|[Xiong Dun] threw a dart while speaking.
0:17:54|0:18:2|[Xiong Dun] opened the red envelope with joy on her face, only to find a stack of lottery tickets inside, her expression immediately changed.
0:18:34|0:18:38|The four of them stood up simultaneously, raised their glasses, and drank in unison.
0:18:38|0:18:42|[Xiong Dun] suddenly put down the food in his hand and ran towards the rooftop.
0:18:42|0:18:48|She pushed open the glass door leading to the rooftop, where four people were leaning over the edge, shouting loudly into the distance.
0:19:2|0:19:9|Four people are playing wildly on the rooftop, spraying champagne on each other.
0:19:9|0:19:18|Even the birthday cake is used as a weapon, with everyone's faces covered in cream. The scene shifts, and [Xiong Dun] carefully unravels a scarf knitted from wool.
0:19:30|0:19:37|[Xiong Dun] couldn't help but recall the painful memory of breaking up, as her first boyfriend pointed at the plain-dressed [Xiong Dun].
0:19:51|0:19:58|She dressed herself up as an artistic girl again, but her third boyfriend chose a tall stewardess.
0:20:6|0:20:13|[Xiong Dun] ran happily towards the bedroom. Suddenly, strange noises could be heard coming from the bedroom.
0:20:19|0:20:25|Immediately, nervously looking at [Lao Zheng] and [Xiao Xia] beside him, the three of them stood up and ran towards the bedroom.
0:20:25|0:20:33|[ Xiong Dun ] is seen lying flat on the ground. The screen goes black, and then,
0:20:33|0:20:42|[Xiong Dun] lies on the hospital bed with an oxygen mask on. She tightly closes her eyes, but soon slowly opens them to find herself in the hospital.
0:20:42|0:20:51|The sunlight shone on her face, the surroundings unusually quiet, only the sound of machines operating and water dripping. She took off the oxygen mask and sat up.
0:20:51|0:20:56|Looking around in confusion, she realized that besides herself, there was no one else around.
0:20:56|0:21:3|She got up and walked out of the ward, and what caught her eye was a dilapidated corridor, with eerie lights flickering in the dimly lit hallway.
0:21:3|0:21:9|Her gaze fell on the anti-theft door not far away. The door was prominently marked with the warning, "Danger, do not approach."
0:21:9|0:21:17|In bold red letters, Xiong Dun, refusing to give up, bravely moves forward step by step, surrounded by dilapidated facilities.
0:21:17|0:21:25|Telecommunication cables were tangled messily. In the corridor, eerie singing could be heard. She stood still, staring intently at the security door not far away. At this moment,
0:21:25|0:21:33|Outside the door, several zombies with gaping mouths suddenly appeared. The zombies, through the glass, spotted [Xiong Dun] not far away and began to fiercely pound on the door.
0:21:33|0:21:38|[Xiong Dun] retreated in horror, but before he could take a few steps back, the zombies broke through the door blocked by the baseball bat.
0:21:38|0:21:58|Before long, hordes of zombies poured in from the doorway. However, Xiong Dun was already scared stiff, only retreating backwards. He accidentally stepped on a belt, causing the metal on it to make a noise, attracting the attention of the zombie horde. They suddenly started rushing towards Xiong Dun frantically. Instead of running away, Xiong Dun stood still, the fear on his face disappearing in an instant, replaced by a resolute and fierce look in his eyes.
0:21:58|0:22:4|She kicked the belt on the ground with her foot, tied it around her waist, and had two pistols tied around her waist.
0:22:4|0:22:10|She grabbed a piece of cloth and tied it around her shoulders as a cape, quickly pulled out a gun, and shot at the approaching zombies.
0:22:10|0:22:19|[Xiong Dun]'s marksmanship is steady and precise, with clean and swift movements. In a moment, she has taken out many zombies. She jumps down, stepping on a zombie's shoulder, performing a magnificent spin in the air.
0:22:19|0:22:28|Riding on top of the zombie, she aimed a shot at its head. With a gun in each hand, she charged into the zombie horde, and soon ran out of bullets. Just then,
0:22:28|0:22:36|At the other end of the corridor, a large number of zombies also appeared. [Xiong Dun], however, remained calm and collected, taking out two new magazines from his waist and throwing them into the air, quickly reloading.
0:22:36|0:22:41|She pushed the gun away and spun around with her arms outstretched, shooting at the zombies on both sides, causing them to fall one after another.
0:22:41|0:22:51|[Xiong Dun] kicks a zombie away, then jumps up in place, flying onto the nearby wall. She runs forward along the wall while shooting, then performs a spin in mid-air before landing on the ground.
0:22:51|0:22:59|She looked up and saw the remaining three zombies, showing a victorious smile. She stood up to continue shooting, only to find that the bullets had run out, [Xiong Dun] clenched his fists.
0:22:59|0:23:8|Aiming at the zombie's head, she used all her strength to charge forward. At this moment, the scene shifted, and [Xiong Dun] was lying on a hospital bed in reality. She suddenly roared and sat up straight.
0:23:14|0:23:21|[Xiong Dun] slowly opened his eyes, with [Doctor Liang] wearing a mask standing by the hospital bed.
0:23:23|0:23:44|[Doctor Liang] felt the burning gaze of [Xiong Dun], so [Doctor Liang] quickly put the pen in his pocket and lowered his head to check on [Xiong Dun]'s condition.
0:23:59|0:24:4|[Xiong Dun] suddenly sat up excitedly. The smile on her face disappeared instantly as she lay back down. With the examination by [Doctor Liang],
0:24:4|0:24:10|[Xiong Dun] cried out in pain. [Lao Zheng], [Ai Mi], and [Xiao Xia] walked in.
0:24:11|0:24:17|[Lao Zheng] is teasing [Xiong Dun] at the end of the bed, and [Xiong Dun] extends his finger, making a threatening gesture towards [Lao Zheng].
0:24:17|0:24:21|[Doctor Liang] slowly takes off his mask while looking through Xiong Dun's test results.
0:24:21|0:24:27|[Xiong Dun] stared at [Doctor Liang]'s face, his eyes devoid of focus but shining. He possessed a meticulously sculpted face.
0:24:27|0:24:35|High nose bridge and delicate lips. [Xiong Dun] was stunned. [Doctor Liang] was completely unaware of [Xiong Dun]'s gaze.
0:24:52|0:24:58|[Doctor Liang] settled everything and walked away with the list in hand, as [Xiong Dun] exclaimed excitedly.
0:25:27|0:25:34|Shortly after, [Xiong Dun] entered the room where the biopsy was being performed.
0:25:58|0:26:5|[Xiong Dun] stopped undressing and lay back. She couldn't contain her excitement.
0:26:5|0:26:14|Resting his head on his hand, lifting one foot up. Then, he lay on the bed and fixed his hair, propping his chin with his hand, lost in thought. At this moment,
0:26:14|0:26:15|The nurse walked in.
0:26:20|0:26:24|[Xiong Dun] hadn't reacted yet when he saw a white-haired, already balding [Doctor Liang] walking in.
0:26:24|0:26:32|The doctor held a huge syringe and smiled kindly at Xiong Dun. Xiong Dun widened his eyes and then fainted in fear.
0:26:32|0:26:39|After the examination, Xiong Dun slowly opened his eyes. In front of him, there was suddenly Xiao Xia holding a pen.
0:26:50|0:26:53|[Xiao Xia] smirked, revealing her missing front tooth.
0:26:53|0:26:58|[Xiong Dun] looked at [Xiao Xia] who was motionless, stood up angrily, grabbed his leg and put him down.
0:26:59|0:27:3|She got out of bed, put on her shoes, and walked out while moving her shoulders.
0:27:3|0:27:7|[Xiao Xia] sat on [Xiong Dun]'s bed, watching her walk out.
0:27:9|0:27:16|With a sinister smile on his face, [Xiong Dun] walked out of the ward, hands in his pockets, pacing in the corridor. People around him looked at [Xiong Dun] with strange eyes.
0:27:16|0:27:21|Some people even laughed out loud. [Xiong Dun] felt the strangeness of the people around him, but didn't know what had happened.
0:27:21|0:27:27|Uncomfortably scratching his head, he ran to the bathroom. In the mirror, Xiong Dun's face was covered in black watercolor pen marks.
0:27:27|0:27:33|Wearing a small beard and an eye patch, resembling a pirate, [Xiong Dun] was so angry that he huffed and puffed.
0:27:38|0:27:50|A rural man walked in, the little boy's father turned his head and greeted [Xiong Dun] expressionlessly.
0:28:8|0:28:15|[Mao Dou's Dad] turned and walked out. Seeing this, [Xiong Dun] quickly pulled [Mao Dou] in front of him and asked.
0:28:19|0:28:24|[Xiong Dun] stared at [Mao Dou], biting his lip and rolling his eyes, then his imagination ran wild.
0:28:24|0:28:34|In the imagination, [Mao Dou's Dad] stands in a dim corridor, surrounded by smoke, wearing sunglasses, with a cigarette in his mouth, holding a machine gun and continuously firing ahead.
0:28:34|0:28:38|The firepower gradually increases, continuously shooting at the camera.
0:28:40|0:28:47|[Doctor Liang] suddenly burst in.
0:29:23|0:29:35|[Doctor Liang] suppressed a smile and glanced at [Mao Dou]. [Xiong Dun] nodded obediently and watched [Doctor Liang] leave. Then he turned his head and glared at [Mao Dou] who was smirking on the side.
0:29:41|0:29:48|[Lao Zheng] and [Xiao Xia] came to see [Xiong Dun]. [Mao Dou] pointed at [Lao Zheng]'s chest, insisting that he is the older brother, which made [Lao Zheng] stand up in a hurry to prove otherwise.
0:30:8|0:30:15|[Xiao Xia], influenced by [Mao Dou], stared at [Lao Zheng] on the side. [Xiao Xia] was startled and quickly averted her gaze.
0:30:16|0:30:24|[Lao Zheng] wrapped his coat tightly. [Xiao Xia] accompanied [Mao Dou], playing on the side. In the corridor.
0:30:53|0:30:56|[Xiong Dun] watched everything from the side. He saw the woman approaching.
0:30:56|0:31:1|Hastily turned his head and averted his gaze. The woman flicked the cigarette butt into the trash can at [Xiong Dun]'s feet.
0:31:1|0:31:9|[Xiong Dun] couldn't help but be curious, but the woman gave her a disdainful look without hesitation.
0:31:12|0:31:17|[Doctor Liang] examines [Xiong Dun], all the while soothing her with a gentle tone.
0:31:17|0:31:27|[Xiong Dun] bit his hand tightly in pain, holding back tears. In the hospital room, [Mao Dou] touched [Xiong Dun]'s head.
0:31:48|0:31:56|[Xiong Dun] was touched on the wound and instinctively waved his hand towards [Mao Dou].
0:31:57|0:32:4|[Mao Dou] suddenly started to have a nosebleed, [Xiong Dun] quickly pressed the call button. [Doctor Liang] and the nurse rushed over with a gurney.
0:32:12|0:32:18|[Xiong Dun] lowered his head guiltily. He looked like a child who had done something wrong, with a worried expression as he gazed at [Mao Dou].
0:32:30|0:32:42|[Xiong Dun] 's face changed, he swallowed hard, thinking about his illness, and couldn't help but start to have wild thoughts.
0:32:51|0:32:57|With wide eyes full of fear, she fell onto the bed, her mind racing with wild thoughts as she began a new fantasy.
0:32:57|0:33:2|[Xiong Dun], wearing a wool coat and fluffy earmuffs, stood by a lake. It was snowing heavily with big snowflakes falling down.
0:33:2|0:33:8|Her face was pale, her body weak, and before long, she became too exhausted, closing her eyes and falling backwards.
0:33:8|0:33:13|But before she could fall to the ground, the scene suddenly froze, with her body suspended in mid-air.
0:33:13|0:33:22|Snowflakes falling in the air also froze, as if time had stopped. Not far away, the figure of Doctor Liang suddenly appeared, walking slowly towards Xiong Dun.
0:33:22|0:33:28|His eyes were filled with worry and reluctance. He walked forward, his eyes red, his brows furrowed tightly.
0:33:28|0:33:34|He looked at [Xiong Dun], reached out and hugged her around the waist, but [Xiong Dun] kept her eyes tightly closed, completely unaware.
0:33:34|0:33:42|[Doctor Liang] hugged [Xiong Dun] tightly, raised one arm, and cast a spell into the air. The world immediately returned to its original state, and time began to flow again.
0:33:42|0:33:48|Snowflakes began to fall again. [Xiong Dun] woke up and locked eyes with [Doctor Liang]. Speaking in Korean, [Doctor Liang] said, "
0:34:3|0:34:7|I am satisfied with a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand of them.
0:34:7|0:34:12|[Xiong Dun] was stunned, before he could answer, [Doctor Liang] slowly leaned in.
0:34:12|0:34:17|The two of them closed their eyes in unison and passionately kissed each other in the icy snow.
0:34:17|0:34:20|[Xiong Dun] is immersed in this beautiful dream and refuses to wake up.
0:34:20|0:34:28|Lying on the hospital bed with her mouth pouted, she then revealed a dreamy smile and gradually woke up. She rolled her eyes and looked to the side.
0:34:28|0:34:36|Their eyes met [Doctor Liang]'s gaze. With a furrowed brow, [Doctor Liang] looked at her with a strange expression. Around the hospital bed, there were about ten people.
0:34:36|0:34:44|[Xiong Dun] covers his face, avoiding the gaze of the crowd.
0:35:15|0:35:26|[Xiong Dun], wearing heavy makeup and a low-cut dress, walked back and forth in the hospital building. Just as she walked down the escalator, she saw [Doctor Liang] approaching with two other doctors. [Xiong Dun] gave a sly smile.
0:35:26|0:35:35|Wearing high heels and full of confidence, she walked up and pretended to pass by. [Doctor Liang], however, frowned, looked through the documents in his hand, and didn't even see [Xiong Dun].
0:35:42|0:35:53|The scene cuts to a room where Doctor Liang and another doctor are examining the patient's films. Xiong Dun, like a shadow, follows behind Doctor Liang, leaning against a table not far away, fidgeting.
0:35:53|0:35:57|[Xiong Dun] pulls out all the stops to get [Doctor Liang]'s attention.
0:35:57|0:36:6|[Doctor Liang] was so engrossed in his work that he didn't even notice [Xiong Dun] standing beside him. He turned around and walked away again, leaving [Xiong Dun] rolling his eyes in resignation, but determinedly following after him.
0:36:6|0:36:8|Doctor Liang is making rounds in the ward.
0:36:8|0:36:15|[Xiong Dun] stood outside the glass window, swaying back and forth. When the nurse saw [Xiong Dun], she quickly pulled up the curtain. At that moment, three men dressed as farmers,
0:36:15|0:36:24|Discussing in the hallway about [Doctor Liang].
0:36:28|0:36:35|[Doctor Liang] pushed open a door and walked out. [Xiong Dun] rushed forward and dragged him away.
0:36:37|0:36:44|[Doctor Liang] was startled by [Xiong Dun], who pushed open the door of a storage room and dragged [Doctor Liang] inside to hide.
0:36:56|0:37:4|Face to face, squeezed into a small storage room, they involuntarily get closer. [Xiong Dun] widens his eyes and lifts his head up.
0:37:10|0:37:18|[Xiong Dun] suddenly stopped and changed the subject. She blinked her eyes, signaling [Doctor Liang] to look.
0:37:33|0:37:39|[Doctor Liang] paused for a moment, feeling that he was not serious enough. Then he continued speaking.
0:37:48|0:37:56|Upon hearing Doctor Liang's explanation, Xiong Dun's smile disappeared instantly. Doctor Liang's expression, on the other hand, began to look unnatural and his heartbeat started to accelerate.
0:38:18|0:38:21|[Xiong Dun] didn't want to part with [Doctor Liang] yet, so he deliberately delayed the time.
0:38:21|0:38:29|Secretly burying his head on [Doctor Liang]'s shoulder, unable to help but cover his mouth and chuckle. After succeeding, [Xiong Dun] couldn't help but start to daydream again.
0:38:29|0:38:35|She fantasized that she and [Doctor Liang] were on a beach, and the crutch he was holding turned into a coconut tree.
0:38:35|0:38:43|The bright sunlight shines on their faces, casting on the beach beside. [Xiong Dun] nestles in [Doctor Liang]'s chest, shyly covering her face.
0:38:43|0:38:49|Doctor Liang looked around and rested his chin on Xiong Dun's head, extending his other arm to embrace Xiong Dun.
0:38:49|0:38:54|[Xiong Dun] placed his hand on [Doctor Liang]'s chest, closing his eyes contentedly.
0:38:54|0:38:59|[Xiong Dun] was startled by his own fart, his thoughts snapped back to reality, and the atmosphere became extremely awkward.
0:39:5|0:39:11|The two walked out, only to be tripped by the clutter on the floor. [Doctor Liang] quickly caught [Xiong Dun] who was about to fall.
0:39:55|0:39:57|[Doctor Liang] did not take the money and lowered his head in shame.
0:40:4|0:40:12|[Doctor Liang] gathered up the courage and said these words. The air suddenly quieted down. Several people fell silent, their faces filled with undeniable sadness.
0:40:21|0:40:36|Lao Cui was stunned, looking at the innocent and naive [Mao Dou], not knowing how to respond for a moment.
0:40:46|0:41:1|[Xiong Dun] half lying on the bed, holding a paintbrush and notebook in her hand, she watches the lively [Mao Dou] with a fond smile. Lao Cui looks at his son's figure and lets out a gentle sigh.
0:41:1|0:41:8|He glanced at [Xiong Dun], then quickly looked away, stood up, and slowly started packing his luggage.
0:41:17|0:41:24|Turning around and standing by the window, crying heartbreakingly, his shoulders shaking uncontrollably, he buried his head lower and lower, unable to straighten up due to the intense crying.
0:41:24|0:41:28|The sunlight streamed in from the window, casting a lonely shadow over the father.
0:41:30|0:41:37|The hospital was bustling with people coming and going, all seeking medical help. There were [Doctor Liang] and nurses hurrying around, as well as the hopeful family members of the patients.
0:41:37|0:41:42|And Lao Cui's hope was gone.
0:41:56|0:42:1|[Xiong Dun] stopped the pen she was drawing with, turned her head to look at [Mao Dou], and asked as she put down the pen.
0:42:9|0:42:19|Mao Dou looked at Xiong Dun expectantly.
0:42:19|0:42:29|[Xiong Dun] couldn't help but laugh out loud.
0:42:31|0:42:37|She tidied up the things in her hands. [Mao Dou] lay on the bed, unable to hide his joy.
0:43:26|0:43:30|[Mao Dou] listened to [Xiong Dun]'s story, suddenly felt drowsy, closed his eyes, and fell asleep.
0:43:30|0:43:45|The next day, everyone accompanied [Mao Dou] to leave the hospital. [Xiong Dun] gave [Mao Dou] a handmade flipbook, and she squatted on the ground, vividly demonstrating it to [Mao Dou].
0:44:11|0:44:16|Mao Dou patted Xiong Dun on the shoulder like a little adult, then turned around and started playing around with Xiao Xia behind him.
0:44:16|0:44:25|[Xiong Dun] turned his head and exchanged a smile with [Lao Zheng], while Lao Sun on the side shouted with a smile. Upon hearing his father's call, [Mao Dou] turned around.
0:44:33|0:44:38|[Mao Dou] happily lay on his dad's shoulder. [Xiong Dun's Mother] and the others watched [Mao Dou].
0:44:50|0:44:54|[Xiong Dun] leaned on [Lao Zheng]'s shoulder, and [Lao Zheng] comfortingly patted her back.
0:44:54|0:45:2|At night, [Doctor Liang] stood at the edge of the rooftop railing, lost in thought. [Xiong Dun], wrapped up tightly, walked past him without making a sound.
0:45:31|0:45:37|[Xiong Dun] pretended to ask casually, waiting anxiously for an answer, but [Doctor Liang] did not give her a direct response.
0:46:10|0:46:16|The two people joked around and the atmosphere became more cheerful.
0:47:19|0:47:26|She imagined giving herself a slap. The beaten [Xiong Dun] covered her face in grievance.
0:47:30|0:47:39|[Xiong Dun] was caught off guard, slowly turned his eyes and twisted his head, grimacing awkwardly, wishing he could fly away immediately. A sudden ringtone from a cellphone broke the awkward silence.
0:47:48|0:47:56|[Xiong Dun] nodded obediently and watched [Doctor Liang] leave out of the corner of her eye. She felt too embarrassed and banged her head against the nearby wall.
0:47:56|0:48:9|Then he made a gesture of shooting himself in the head with his hand, followed by a stabbing motion towards his abdomen, and finally collapsed against the wall pretending to be dead. [Doctor Liang] was nearby, watching her with a smile in his eyes.
0:48:9|0:48:17|The next day, [Xiao Xia] and [Lao Zheng] sat in [Doctor Liang]'s office.
0:48:39|0:48:45|[Lao Zheng] snatched the file from [Doctor Liang]'s hand, and the expression on [Lao Zheng]'s face was one of disbelief when he saw the results.
0:48:45|0:48:53|Sitting in the chair, unable to come to his senses for a long time. Xiao Xia saw Lao Zheng's reaction and panicked, only to see the diagnosis results written on it.
0:48:53|0:48:59|Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Later, the two of them found [Ai Mi] and the three of them sat in the hospital cafeteria.
0:49:32|0:49:41|[Xiao Xia] looked at [Ai Mi] who was speaking earnestly, and raised her hand again. At this moment, [Xiong Dun] suddenly walked in, and the conversation among the three came to a sudden halt.
0:49:58|0:50:4|[Xiong Dun] said casually.
0:50:4|0:50:12|Lao Zheng immediately lowered his head, avoiding Xiong Dun's gaze. Ai Mi glanced at Lao Zheng and hesitated to speak, her eyes wandering.
0:50:58|0:51:4|[Xiong Dun] clasped his hands together and closed his eyes, but [Ai Mi] and the other two were not feeling happy.
0:51:22|0:51:30|[Xiong Dun] pushed the chair away and stood up, patting [Xiao Xia] on the shoulder. She happily spread her arms, humming a song, and ran out.
0:51:30|0:51:38|Lao Zheng sighed, with Ai Mi looking worried as well.
0:51:50|0:51:57|[Xiao Xia] was caught off guard and stood there in a daze. Lao Zheng sat angrily against the backrest, and the three of them fell into silence.
0:51:57|0:52:3|In the evening, [Xiao Xia] sat on the sofa eating noodles from a lunchbox, while Lao Zheng anxiously searched for something nearby.
0:52:16|0:52:21|Lao Zheng suddenly slammed the drawer shut and sat down heavily on the floor.
0:52:30|0:52:40|Sitting at the dining table, [Ai Mi] couldn't control herself and started to cry. Lao Zheng waved his hand, trying hard to restrain his emotions.
0:52:41|0:52:46|[Xiao Xia] lowered her head, with red eyes, slurping noodles in an attempt to shake off the sorrow.
0:52:46|0:52:51|Lao Zheng continued to search for the disc, but suddenly stood up and knocked over Xiao Xia's lunchbox.
0:52:54|0:52:58|[Xiao Xia] was startled by [Lao Zheng]'s sudden movement, her hands frozen in midair.
0:52:58|0:53:9|The noodles in his mouth, not yet swallowed, he looked up at [Lao Zheng] with tears in his eyes. [Lao Zheng] looked down at [Xiao Xia], and finally, like a deflated ball, he slumped onto the sofa.
0:53:9|0:53:16|On the side, [Ai Mi] couldn't help but shed tears as well. The three of them fell into silence, and [Xiao Xia] couldn't hold back anymore, tears streaming down her face.
0:53:16|0:53:23|At this moment, [Xiong Dun] is sitting in the hospital corridor, holding a tablet in his hand with the comic strips created by [Xiong Dun].
0:53:23|0:53:31|The protagonist in the comic is wearing a patient gown, with a group of demons behind him. Unable to escape, the protagonist turns around and unleashes a burst of fire to drive away all the demons.
0:53:31|0:53:40|The next day, [Xiong Dun] sat on the toilet, searching for information on non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
0:53:40|0:53:44|In the restroom stall, there was suddenly a commotion.
0:53:54|0:54:0|[Xiong Dun] opened the toilet door and walked out, looking curiously to the side. As she washed her hands, the person in the next stall walked out.
0:54:0|0:54:8|It turned out to be the glamorous woman who was smoking in the corridor earlier. [Xiong Dun] couldn't help but glance at her, and both reached for the hand sanitizer at the same time.
0:54:8|0:54:16|The woman turned her head, staring coldly at [Xiong Dun], who was a little scared and more like a servant, taking the initiative to help her squeeze the hand sanitizer.
0:54:44|0:54:47|[Xia Meng] hung up the phone and turned around, standing by the window.
0:54:47|0:54:55|[Xiong Dun] sat on the bed, biting his fingers, staring blankly at the fruits on the table placed by [Xia Meng]. Seeing this, [Xia Meng] picked up the fruit basket and brought it in front of [Xiong Dun].
0:54:57|0:55:4|[Xiong Dun] bit his finger, showing a look of being flattered, and tremblingly took out a small bunch of grapes.
0:55:6|0:55:15|[Xiong Dun] once again immersed herself in her own fantasy. She imagined herself in an ancient palace, wearing Qing Dynasty clothing.
0:55:15|0:55:23|She knelt on the ground, carefully aiming ahead. [Xia Meng] was dressed in gorgeous attire, with two palace maids standing beside her, she raised her delicate fingers,
0:55:23|0:55:30|Picked up a bunch of grapes from the table and threw them on the ground.
0:55:32|0:55:39|[Xiong Dun] looked up and saw Xia Meng, startled, he quickly bent down and crawled over to pick up the grapes.
0:55:42|0:55:52|[Xia Meng] rolled her eyes disdainfully, the scene shifted back to reality. [Xia Meng] was lying on the bed wearing headphones and reading a book. [Xiong Dun] felt [Xia Meng]'s gaze and smiled as he handed her a bunch of grapes.
0:55:52|0:56:1|[Xia Meng] coldly turned her head away, ignoring her. Due to the chemotherapy, [Xiong Dun] began to vomit continuously. She squatted by the toilet, coughing from being choked by her own vomit.
0:56:1|0:56:8|She curled up, her face as white as a sheet of paper. After emptying her stomach, [Xiong Dun] walked out of the bathroom looking haggard.
0:56:8|0:56:13|She walked forward weakly, but a familiar voice appeared in her ear.
0:56:22|0:56:27|[Xiong Dun] saw his parents carrying big and small bags, holding back tears and smiling. The scene then shifted to a few days ago,
0:56:52|0:57:0|[Xiong Dun's Father] and mother saw their daughter, the three of them looked at each other in silence.
0:57:35|0:57:43|[Doctor Liang] finished explaining [Xiong Dun]'s condition to [Xiong Dun's parents]. They sat in silence on the chairs, with tears glistening in [Xiong Dun]'s mother's eyes.
0:57:43|0:57:47|[Xiong Dun's Father] also looked absent-minded on the side. Afterwards,
0:57:47|0:57:53|[Xiong Dun's Parents] walked out of the office, with [Xiong Dun]'s mother looking dazed, as if she had lost her soul, and she left first.
0:57:53|0:58:3|[Xiong Dun's Father] nodded slightly at [Doctor Liang] and followed. [Doctor Liang] stood at the office door, watching the lonely figures of the two elderly people, feeling sorry in his heart. [Xiong Dun's Parents] stopped halfway.
0:58:3|0:58:8|Both of them were trying hard to control their tears.
0:58:10|0:58:21|[Xiong Dun's Father] turned around with red eyes, found an excuse and left. [Xiong Dun's Mother] stood still, unable to control herself anymore, and started to sob. Then, she quickly wiped away her tears, forced herself to stay calm, and walked forward.
0:58:21|0:58:22|In the supermarket,
0:58:22|0:58:31|[Xiong Dun's Father] stood in front of a row of shelves, carefully selecting snacks for his daughter. Various types of potato chips were displayed on the shelves, and he casually picked up a bag.
0:58:31|0:58:35|Squinting with his presbyopic eyes, furrowing his brow, he looked back and forth at the words above.
0:58:35|0:58:41|After watching for a while, he finally put it into the shopping bag with relief, then picked up another one. He picked up another bag of potato chips.
0:58:41|0:58:46|Slowly reaching out in front of his eyes, studying the words on it, he couldn't hold back anymore.
0:58:46|0:58:55|The moment of strength he had built up earlier crumbled, as he slowly put down the bag of potato chips and began to cry silently, while his other hand weakly supported the nearby shelf.
0:58:55|0:59:1|It seems like if he doesn't do this, he won't be able to hold on and will collapse. He sobbed, his shoulders shaking violently with each cry.
0:59:1|0:59:10|He seemed to age a lot in an instant. The little girl next to him saw Xiong Dun's Father, who was choked with sobs, and cast a concerned look at him, but dared not approach, so she turned and left.
0:59:10|0:59:14|Afraid of disturbing him, the people around also turned back curiously to look.
0:59:14|0:59:23|I don't know why this old man is crying. [Xiong Dun's Father] cried for a while, then wiped his tears, put the potato chips back into the basket, adjusted his emotions, and turned to leave.
0:59:43|0:59:48|[Xiong Dun] nodded perfunctorily. [Xiong Dun] turned his head to look at his mother with a pretended calmness.
0:59:48|0:59:52|Sticking out his tongue to lick the candy stains off the corners of his mouth, [Xiong Dun's Mother] angrily pushed him away.
1:0:32|1:0:38|[Doctor Liang] entered the room with a group of interns. Upon seeing [Doctor Liang], [Xiong Dun] immediately sat up straight, pretending to be a lady.
1:0:40|1:0:46|A young doctor picks up the file in his hand.
1:0:47|1:0:53|[Xiong Dun] sat on the hospital bed, feeling secretly delighted.
1:2:58|1:3:3|The man rode away on a motorcycle without mercy, with [Xia Meng] following behind, shouting loudly regardless of her image.
1:3:3|1:3:9|Pedestrians hurriedly passed by on the street, [Xiong Dun] leaned against the window, shocked by everything. In the evening,
1:3:9|1:3:13|[Xia Meng] sat dejectedly by the window, where a pile of beer cans sat on the sill.
1:3:13|1:3:21|She cried while picking up a beer to drink. [Xiong Dun] slept soundly with an eye mask on, but was awakened by [Xia Meng]'s movements. [Xiong Dun] took off the eye mask.
1:3:21|1:3:28|Glancing at [Xia Meng], she noticed [Xiong Dun]'s gaze, covered her eyes, put down the beer in her hand, and stood up again.
1:3:28|1:3:32|Carrying several unfinished cans of beer in his arms, he turned around and walked out.
1:3:32|1:3:48|[Xiong Dun] stared intently at [Xia Meng]'s every move, feeling uneasy. She immediately lifted the blanket, got out of bed, grabbed the coat on the chair, and hurried out without even taking off her eye mask. She followed [Xia Meng] stealthily to the rooftop. [Xia Meng] placed the beer can by the parapet, preparing to climb up.
1:4:6|1:4:12|[Xia Meng] finished speaking and started drinking by herself. [Xiong Dun] looked on eagerly. She glanced at [Xiong Dun] and said.
1:4:15|1:4:21|[Xiong Dun] grinned widely, infecting [Xia Meng] as well. The two of them hit it off immediately and began their own night of revelry.
1:4:21|1:4:26|The scene shifts, [Xia Meng] is wearing a cool leather jacket, a helmet on her head, riding a motorcycle,
1:4:26|1:4:33|[Xiong Dun] sat behind her, excitedly opening her arms and shouting. The two of them were speeding through a tunnel filled with parked cars.
1:4:33|1:4:41|Releasing long-suppressed emotions, casting aside illness and worries, on this special night, indulging oneself freely.
1:5:0|1:5:7|[Xiong Dun] was at a loss for words and could only pick up a beer can, drinking continuously.
1:6:18|1:6:23|Revealing their innermost thoughts, they gradually established a friendship.
1:6:23|1:6:30|[Xiong Dun] finished his drink, leaned against the railing of the overpass, looked up at the sky, and joyfully shouted. The camera gradually zoomed out.
1:6:30|1:6:34|At their feet lay a large pile of empty beer cans, the cold wind blowing their scarves.
1:6:34|1:6:41|The next day, [Xiong Dun] sat in front of the mirror in the dressing room, reluctant to touch his thick hair, sighing.
1:7:5|1:7:9|[Xia Meng], with a shaved head and holding a pair of scissors, gently touched [Xiong Dun]'s head to comfort her.
1:7:9|1:7:28|[Xiong Dun] pouted in grievance, although her tone was light, her heart was very reluctant. She closed her eyes and imagined herself with long flowing hair, tossing a beautiful red curly hair, happily running on a grassland. [Xia Meng]'s technique was very skillful, in no time, [Xiong Dun]'s hair had turned into a short bob.
1:7:28|1:7:33|Cut off the messy hair, falling down one by one, lightly landing on the ground.
1:7:33|1:7:43|[Xiong Dun] tightly closed his eyes, unable to help but start to imagine what he would look like with various hairstyles. It was at this moment of losing his hair that he suddenly realized he had never properly cared for it.
1:7:43|1:7:56|In Xiong Dun's imagination, she switches between having elegant big waves, neat short hair, and handsome silver-gray hair. The imagined self is confident and beautiful, laughing happily and running forward.
1:7:56|1:8:5|The sunlight shines through the trees onto the grass, illuminating the bright and lively Xiong Dun, who in reality has grown into a young man with short hair.
1:8:5|1:8:21|The usually carefree [Xiong Dun] who is not afraid of taking medicine, injections, or chemotherapy, becomes anxious and unsettled when facing the imminent loss of her hair. In her imagination, [Doctor Liang] stands before her, raising his hand to gently stroke her hair. There is a look of love in [Doctor Liang]'s eyes.
1:8:23|1:8:30|[Xiong Dun] slowly opened his eyes, and in the mirror, he saw five bald heads, with [Lao Zheng], [Ai Mi], and [Xiao Xia].
1:8:45|1:8:55|In this way, [Xiong Dun], [Xia Meng], [Ai Mi], [Lao Zheng], and [Xiao Xia], all shaved their heads, and the five of them walked confidently on the street, not afraid of the eyes of the people around them.
1:8:55|1:9:15|They arrived at a bridal shop, looking at the various wedding dresses inside with excitement. [Xia Meng] was the first to pick a dress to try on. As she lifted the curtain, everyone was amazed and opened their mouths in surprise. Looking at [Xia Meng] standing there, elegant and noble in the wedding dress, [Ai Mi] also put on a wedding dress and struck a sweet pose. Even the tomboy [Lao Zheng] put on a dress for the first time.
1:9:15|1:9:26|Shortly after, [Xiong Dun] changed into a stylish wedding dress and mischievously stuck out his tongue at [Lao Zheng] and the others. In the underground passage, a group of young people were singing and playing the guitar, and as [Xiong Dun] and his group passed by,
1:9:26|1:9:28|Excitedly joining in, he started dancing.
1:9:28|1:9:38|Later, the five of them arrived at a wig shop, ready to dress up. [Xiao Xia] took on the role of photographer, capturing their various strange outfits with her camera.
1:9:38|1:9:48|[Xiao Xia] was not content with just being a photographer, so she quickly ran up and joined them, setting the camera timer. The five of them laughed heartily in front of the camera. As night fell, they arrived at a high-end restaurant.
1:10:16|1:10:22|[Xiao Xia] finished using the restroom and was washing her hands at the sink when a man walked past behind her. [Xiao Xia] took a closer look.
1:10:22|1:10:30|The person discovered turns out to be Xiong Dun's ex-boyfriend, Xiao Chuan. Xiao Chuan admires himself in the mirror, touches his greasy hair, whistles, while Xiao Xia looks at him thoughtfully.
1:10:36|1:10:43|[Ai Mi] hesitated with the hand holding the bottle, shocked as she glanced at [Lao Zheng] beside her. She put down the bottle and looked around with [Lao Zheng].
1:10:52|1:10:58|[Xia Meng] raised a glass of water and took a sip, with a meaningful expression.
1:11:0|1:11:7|[Xia Meng] stood up, hugged the bewildered [Xiao Xia], and turned to leave. [Xia Meng] and [Xiao Xia] found a foreign waiter and the three of them huddled together, discussing something in low voices.
1:11:17|1:11:22|[Xia Meng] cautiously pushed open the door to the men's restroom. The waiter stood on either side of the door, watching out for her, and let her in.
1:11:22|1:11:31|[Xia Meng] slipped in, and the waiter pretended to be serious, crossing his arms and standing at the door. [Xia Meng] hid behind the wall and looked into the bathroom, finding it empty, so she walked in confidently.
1:12:35|1:12:40|Xiaoguan's girlfriend looked at [Xiao Xia] with a mixture of belief and doubt, her face turning ugly. [Xiao Xia] continued speaking.
1:12:44|1:12:47|[Xiao Xia] showed an expression that was hard to describe, and Xiao Chuan's girlfriend was scared and lost her color.
1:12:47|1:13:3|On the phone, [Xiong Dun] was amused by [Xiao Xia]'s superb acting, while on the other side, [Xia Meng] walked out and squeezed a bunch of hand sanitizer into her hand. Taking advantage of Xiao Chuan's distraction, [Xia Meng] smeared the hand sanitizer on Xiao Chuan's pants, revealing a malicious smile. Xiao Chuan widened his eyes, at a loss for what to do.
1:13:5|1:13:11|At this moment, Xiong Dun's girlfriend completely believed Xiao Xia's words, her eyes filled with killing intent as she stood up and left her seat.
1:13:11|1:13:19|[Xia Meng] walked out of the men's restroom and said to the waiter. The waiter nodded confidently and walked into the restroom.
1:13:19|1:13:28|Xiao Chuan's girlfriend marched aggressively towards the men's restroom, while Xiao Chuan was struggling to wash the hand sanitizer off his pants at the sink.
1:13:29|1:13:36|The waiter on the side was playing with his cuffs, teasing and smiling at Xiao Chuan. [Xia Meng] deliberately made things difficult for Xiao Chuan's girlfriend at the door.
1:13:39|1:13:45|Xiao Chuan's girlfriend pushed [Xia Meng] aside and rushed into the men's restroom. [Xia Meng] disdainfully pursed her lips, shook her head, and walked away.
1:13:45|1:14:1|Xiao Chuan's girlfriend walked into the restroom and saw Xiao Chuan with the waitress. The waitress turned shyly to glance at Xiao Chuan's girlfriend, then turned back to Xiao Chuan, patted his butt, whispered something naughty in his ear, and left with a mischievous smile on her face. As she walked away, she even bumped into Xiao Chuan's girlfriend's shoulder.
1:14:8|1:14:15|The girlfriend saw everything and no longer believed Xiao Chuan's explanation.
1:14:18|1:14:23|Five people cheerfully walked out of the hotel door.
1:14:23|1:14:26|Everyone suddenly looked outside with a face full of surprise, their eyes shining.
1:14:26|1:14:32|In just the time of a meal, heavy snowflakes began to fall outside, covering the ground with a thick layer of snow.
1:14:32|1:14:39|Everyone laughed and ran forward together, rushing into the heavy snow as if trying to shake off all the unhappiness of this period of time.
1:14:39|1:14:46|She stood in the snow, having a snowball fight with [Ai Mi], [Lao Zheng], and [Xia Meng].
1:14:48|1:15:1|[Xiao Xia] stood at the door, watching the four of them playing around. She couldn't help but laugh, tears glistening in her eyes. But the next moment, she shouted and rushed into the snow, leaping down the steps and landing straight on the snow, using her hands to draw and pull the snow around her.
1:15:1|1:15:8|[Xiong Dun] and the sisters were playing around, throwing the snow in their hands towards [Xiao Xia] on the ground. The five of them were having a great time in this world of ice and snow.
1:15:20|1:15:31|[Xiong Dun] looked up at the sky, snowflakes falling on her face, hair, and scarf. She opened her arms, closed her eyes, and had a happy expression on her face, savoring the joy of the moment.
1:15:31|1:15:42|The scene fades into darkness, entering Xiong Dun's nightmare. In the dream, Xiong Dun is wearing a hospital gown, panting heavily as she runs through a forest as if something is chasing her from behind.
1:15:42|1:15:50|Just then, a zombie appeared in the mist of the forest. [Xiong Dun] was so frightened that he stumbled and fell, and at that moment, the heart rate monitor suddenly started to sound an alarm.
1:16:3|1:16:11|Xiong Dun's nightmare continues as the zombie lunges at her while she's lying on the ground, gnashing its teeth and gripping her neck. Xiong Dun struggles in pain.
1:16:20|1:16:24|Doctor Liang began to resuscitate Xiong Dun, while anxiously watching the electrocardiogram on the side.
1:16:24|1:16:30|He put down the defibrillator and started performing CPR directly. Finally, there was a slight fluctuation on the ECG.
1:16:38|1:16:54|[Doctor Liang] once again defibrillated [Xiong Dun], his eye sockets slightly reddened, looking anxious. However, every time he looked up, the ECG showed no response. He pounded on [Xiong Dun]'s chest with all his might, desperately trying to save his life. [Xiong Dun] was still trapped in her own nightmare, unable to break free, being choked by a zombie and unable to move.
1:16:54|1:17:3|In the dream, [Doctor Liang] held a crossbow, stood behind a tree not far away, aimed at the zombie's head and shot. The zombie was hit in the forehead by the arrow, releasing the grip on [Xiong Dun]'s hand.
1:17:3|1:17:5|Rolled his eyes and fell to the ground.
1:17:5|1:17:11|[Doctor Liang] slowly puts down the crossbow in his hand, while the rescued [Xiong Dun] keeps coughing incessantly.
1:17:13|1:17:21|[Xiong Dun] sat up, breathing heavily in shock, looking at [Doctor Liang] in the distance. [Doctor Liang] looked at her and smiled, with a smirk on his face.
1:17:28|1:17:40|[Doctor Liang] was panting heavily, unable to even find his pen. The nurse beside him reminded him, and he took the pen down, but his hand trembled uncontrollably as he signed. The nurse beside him was also frightened by his appearance.
1:17:40|1:17:48|Xiong Dun's condition has stabilized. She is lying on a nearby hospital bed, with a nurse holding an oxygen mask over her face to help her breathe.
1:17:48|1:17:52|[Doctor Liang] hurriedly fled from the emergency room, unable to recover for a while.
1:17:52|1:17:58|He walked unsteadily in the corridor, his eyes unfocused, as if the one who had just experienced life and death was himself.
1:18:2|1:18:10|Finally, he pushed open the door to the bathroom and stumbled in. Inside, a man smoking was startled by Doctor Liang.
1:18:10|1:18:17|[Doctor Liang] ignored the man's greeting and quickly washed his face. He asked the man for a cigarette, wanting to relax after the tension just now.
1:18:17|1:18:21|The usually dignified Doctor Liang has now turned into an out-of-control middle-aged man.
1:18:21|1:18:30|[Doctor Liang], leaning against the toilet door smoking, suddenly felt unbearable. He coughed and immediately turned around, rushing into the toilet cubicle, kneeling in front of the toilet, and started vomiting.
1:18:30|1:18:36|The man smoking was startled, standing cautiously at the door and asking.
1:18:36|1:18:42|[Doctor Liang] waved his hand quickly to indicate that he was fine. The camera then shifted to the hospital room.
1:18:44|1:18:50|[Xia Meng] bites into an apple and asks the pale-faced [Xiong Dun]. [Xiong Dun] weakly lies in bed and shakes his head.
1:19:10|1:19:17|[Xiong Dun] showed a fascinated smile, turned her head to look at the ceiling, recalling the nightmare she had just had. She imagined herself still in that forest,
1:19:17|1:19:22|Facing the doctor who saved him, [Doctor Liang], they stood still and locked eyes, sparking the flame of love.
1:19:34|1:19:38|[Xiong Dun] immediately turned his head to adjust his wig, holding an unfinished lollipop in his hand.
1:19:39|1:19:42|[Doctor Liang] raised his hand and touched her head.
1:19:46|1:19:53|[Doctor Liang] smiled indulgently, as [Xiong Dun] asked. [Xiong Dun] extended an invitation to [Doctor Liang].
1:20:27|1:20:34|[Xiong Dun] said, looking at [Doctor Liang] with a proud expression on his face.
1:20:51|1:20:58|[Xiong Dun] looked at [Doctor Liang] beside him, and their eyes met. At that moment, [Doctor Liang]'s phone suddenly rang, displaying a message that said,
1:21:5|1:21:11|[Xiong Dun] took the disinfectant handed by [Doctor Liang] and rubbed his hands. He looked up and said to [Doctor Liang].
1:21:17|1:21:22|[Doctor Liang] smiled shyly as he let [Xiong Dun] apply hand cream on his hands.
1:21:24|1:21:30|[Doctor Liang] did not refuse and gladly accepted the gift from [Xiong Dun]. He stuffed the hand cream into his own pocket.
1:21:36|1:21:43|Doctor Liang did not answer her, just kept smiling. He suddenly looked up and gazed into the distance. Xiong Dun followed his gaze.
1:21:43|1:21:52|A group of nurses in the distance were seen standing together, sneakily watching Xiong Dun and Doctor Liang. Doctor Liang cleared his throat uncomfortably, patted Xiong Dun on the shoulder, and then turned and walked away.
1:21:58|1:22:4|[Xiong Dun] watched [Doctor Liang] walk away and started to daydream again. [Doctor Liang] entered the elevator, and the doors closed slowly.
1:22:4|1:22:11|He saw his face reflected on the side of the elevator door, so he slowly bent down to observe carefully. He remembered what Xiong Dun had once said to him.
1:22:11|1:22:18|He grinned and made faces in the mirror for no reason. Then he practiced his smile in front of the elevator door. Suddenly, the elevator door opened.
1:22:18|1:22:25|[Doctor Liang] regained his seriousness in a split second and walked out.
1:22:27|1:22:33|[Xiong Dun's Mother] stood outside the ward making a phone call, sounding anxious. Then she walked in with a worried expression on her face.
1:23:7|1:23:14|[Xiong Dun] looked at his mother, and his mood instantly plummeted.
1:23:14|1:23:22|The next day, [Xiong Dun] appeared at the door of [Doctor Liang]'s office with a bowl of dumplings in her hands. She knocked on the door cautiously, but there was no response.
1:23:22|1:23:29|She had just placed the bowl of dumplings on Doctor Liang's table when voices were heard outside the corridor. Xiong Dun quickly picked up the dumplings.
1:23:29|1:23:38|Hiding in the corner of the office, he pulled down the curtain.
1:24:46|1:25:2|She took off her hat and wig without any hesitation, revealing her bald head. Finally, like an injured kitten, she lay on the bed with her back to [Lao Zheng] and others. The words of [Doctor Liang] were like a slap in the face, waking her up.
1:25:38|1:25:40|The scene shifts, with [Xiong Dun] walking alone on the street.
1:25:40|1:25:48|She stood by the sweet potato stall, holding a steaming hot sweet potato in her hand, eating it while staring into the distance. Back in the ward, [Xia Meng]...
1:25:48|1:25:56|She took out the scarf she knitted for [Doctor Liang].
1:26:14|1:26:18|The atmosphere became awkward, [Doctor Liang] nodded slightly and then turned and left.
1:26:18|1:26:25|[Lao Zheng] and [Xiao Xia] helped [Xiong Dun] pack his luggage to prepare for discharge. Unable to resist, [Xiong Dun] looked towards the door. At that moment, [Xia Meng] walked over and sat by the bed.
1:26:27|1:26:35|Hugging [Xiong Dun], he looked at [Xia Meng] and smiled.
1:26:41|1:26:49|[Doctor Liang] and a nurse were talking about something as they walked by. [Xiao Xia] and [Lao Zheng] waved enthusiastically at [Doctor Liang], who waved back in response.
1:26:52|1:27:2|[Xiong Dun] coldly glanced at him, then quickly looked away and gazed elsewhere. [Doctor Liang] didn't know why [Xiong Dun] was ignoring him, stood foolishly on the side, watching them leave.
1:27:2|1:27:11|[Xiong Dun] and his group entered the elevator. [Doctor Liang] was not far away, looking at [Xiong Dun]. When he saw [Xiong Dun] raise her head, he quickly waved at her, trying hard to get her response.
1:27:11|1:27:17|The elevator doors were about to close, but [Xiong Dun] just stood there, looking at him with resentment and reluctance in his eyes.
1:27:17|1:27:26|[Xiong Dun] was deeply hurt by the words she heard in [Doctor Liang]'s office. She stubbornly believed that [Doctor Liang] was treating her just like any other patient.
1:27:26|1:27:32|In the evening, [Lao Zheng] was driving, with [Xiao Xia] sitting in the passenger seat, and [Xiong Dun] alone in the back seat.
1:27:32|1:27:39|She leaned against the window, chin in hand, enjoying the long-lost night view, her gaze drawn to the person on the street holding a red balloon.
1:28:8|1:28:16|At this moment, [Xiong Dun] barged in with [Lao Zheng] and [Xiao Xia], ignoring the security guard at the door. Do you speak Chinese?
1:29:8|1:29:13|In the corridor, [Xiong Dun] held [Xiao Xia]'s arm and listened silently to [Ai Mi]'s accusations.
1:29:47|1:29:54|[Xiong Dun] looked at [Ai Mi] with red eyes, unbelievably. She suppressed her grievances and anger, turned around without looking back, and quickly walked away.
1:30:3|1:30:8|At that moment, there was only [Ai Mi] left in the corridor, standing still in place.
1:30:8|1:30:16|Back at home, [Ai Mi] was packing her luggage alone, while [Xiong Dun] was in another room holding a doll, lying on the bed drawing, listening to [Ai Mi]'s movements.
1:30:16|1:30:25|[Ai Mi] pulled the suitcase and stopped at the door of [Xiong Dun]'s room, reaching out to knock. [Xiong Dun] put down the paintbrush, sitting up excitedly.
1:30:25|1:30:38|Xiong Dun waited expectantly for Ai Mi's next move, but Ai Mi hesitated, put her hand down, picked up her luggage, and left. Xiong Dun heard Ai Mi leaving, her expression gradually becoming lost. She looked serious, as if she had made a decision.
1:30:38|1:30:49|Picking up her phone to dial, she had a mournful look on her face as she placed the phone to her ear and said. In the blink of an eye, the plane landed.
1:30:49|1:30:54|[Xiong Dun] returned home, and his parents prepared a table full of delicious food to welcome him back.
1:30:54|1:31:0|The whole family sat around the dining table, happily raising their glasses, while [Xiong Dun] sat absentmindedly in the middle.
1:31:0|1:31:6|She forced a smile to accompany her family, trying hard to make herself happy. She started exercising and wrapped herself up tightly.
1:31:6|1:31:11|Wearing a woolen hat and gloves, with earphones on, he gets up early to go for a morning run.
1:31:11|1:31:23|She returned home and saw the door frame covered with wood grain, marking her childhood height. She couldn't help but reach out to touch it, lost in thought. She then found her childhood pencil case, filled with various erasers and small toys.
1:31:23|1:31:31|She took out an old cassette tape, with "Michael Jackson" written on it. After flipping through it, she then took out a strawberry-shaped eraser from the box.
1:31:31|1:31:38|She placed it under her nose, then under the desk lamp, where it emitted a faint light. [Xiong Dun's Mother] was preparing the meal.
1:31:38|1:31:46|Turning her head with a smile, she looked at [Xiong Dun]. [Xiong Dun] stood by the door, measured her height at the moment, and wrote down "29 years old" above. Shortly after, she returned to Beijing.
1:31:54|1:32:2|[Xiao Xia], [Lao Zheng], and [Xia Meng], holding flowers, congratulate [Xiong Dun] on his return. The room is filled with balloons, ribbons, and colorful paper.
1:32:2|1:32:10|[Xiong Dun] embraced his friends with a happy smile on his face. Everyone's life had fallen into place, even [Xia Meng] had started her career as a model.
1:32:10|1:32:18|At this moment, [Ai Mi] was sitting alone in a small restaurant in Japan, looking vacant, while [Xiong Dun] absentmindedly lay on the table drawing.
1:32:21|1:32:27|She opened the email, it was an animation video made by [Xiong Dun]. The little girl in the video had the same hairstyle as [Xiong Dun].
1:32:27|1:32:35|Being beaten alternately by a cactus and a stick, lying on the ground crying, with the words written on top, "I can have my heart broken 10 times, but I can't lose you once."
1:32:36|1:32:43|[Ai Mi] had tears in her eyes, revealing a long-lost smile. [Xiong Dun] leaned against the window, with a solemn face, waiting for [Ai Mi]'s reply.
1:32:45|1:32:49|She picked up her phone, and [Ai Mi] replied to her, "You better live well for your mother."
1:32:49|1:32:58|[Xiong Dun] looked at the message, feeling a sudden sense of relief. Tears glistened in her eyes as she placed her phone on her chest. The two good friends finally untied the knot in their hearts.
1:32:58|1:33:7|The scene cuts to [Xiong Dun] lying on the bed drawing cartoons, suddenly, he starts coughing violently.
1:33:17|1:33:25|The constant coughing made it difficult for her to breathe, and she stood up unsteadily, walking towards the living room. She gradually became unable to stand firmly.
1:33:25|1:33:32|She bent down to support the shelf holding the fish tank. The shelf swayed under her, wobbling back and forth, and soon couldn't hold on any longer.
1:33:32|1:33:35|The shelf fell to the ground, and the fish tank also crashed to the ground.
1:33:35|1:33:47|The fish tank shattered on the ground, Xiong Dun began to feel weak and lost consciousness. At this moment, Lao Zheng rushed in, grabbed the almost falling Xiong Dun, Xiong Dun glanced at Lao Zheng, then closed his eyes and passed out.
1:33:47|1:33:56|[Lao Zheng] kept shouting [Xiong Dun]'s name loudly, but [Xiong Dun] couldn't hear. The scene transitioned to a black screen, and then [Xiong Dun] was once again taken to the hospital.
1:33:56|1:34:3|In the hospital corridor, [Xiong Dun's Father], [Xiong Dun's Mother], and [Lao Zheng] are sitting on chairs, while [Xiao Xia] stands silently by the wall.
1:34:3|1:34:11|Anxiously waiting for Xiong Dun in the emergency room, Xiong Dun's Mother sat hunched in a chair, unable to hold back her tears. Inside the ward,
1:34:11|1:34:18|[Xiong Dun] lay on the hospital bed, unconscious, while [Doctor Liang] fiddled with the chemotherapy equipment beside the bed. At that moment, [Xiong Dun] opened his eyes.
1:34:18|1:34:28|Struggling to endure fatigue and pain, [Xiong Dun] looked at [Doctor Liang] in front of him and spoke.
1:35:8|1:35:17|[Doctor Liang] smiled and reached out his hand to signal [Xiong Dun] to fist bump with him. [Xiong Dun] weakly raised his arm and extended his fingers towards [Doctor Liang].
1:35:17|1:35:24|A smile spread across the pale face. [Doctor Liang] looked at [Xiong Dun] with a smile on his face.
1:35:26|1:35:32|[Doctor Liang] finished speaking and then turned to continue working busily. [Xiong Dun] weakly opened his eyes, but his gaze kept following [Doctor Liang].
1:35:32|1:35:40|[Doctor Liang] was busy recording data, while [Xiong Dun] was busy observing [Doctor Liang]. As he watched, [Xiong Dun] fell asleep with a satisfied smile.
1:35:40|1:35:47|Shortly after, [Xiong Dun] was pushed into the MRI room for examination. [Doctor Liang] and another doctor were outside observing the imaging on the computer.
1:35:47|1:35:53|[Doctor Liang] frowned, looking at the computer screen, then worriedly raised his head and looked through the glass at [Xiong Dun] inside.
1:35:54|1:36:2|The scene cuts back to the hospital room, where Doctor Liang is flipping through Xiong Dun's sketchbook. In the sketchbook, Xiong Dun has drawn Doctor Liang with remarkable accuracy.
1:36:2|1:36:10|With his serious and unsmiling demeanor, as well as his exhausted look leaning against his forehead while sleeping, Doctor Liang glanced at Xiong Dun lying on the hospital bed.
1:36:10|1:36:16|Sitting cautiously on the stool, [Xiong Dun] sleeps restlessly, breathing heavily and occasionally tossing and turning.
1:36:16|1:36:23|[Doctor Liang] watched her attentively, paying attention to her every move, while continuing to flip through her sketchbook. The sketchbook revealed balloons and little figures once again.
1:36:23|1:36:25|Doctor Liang finished admiring the painting,
1:36:26|1:36:33|He lovingly touched the cover of the album, turned his head, and placed it on the bedside table. [Xiong Dun] gradually woke up.
1:36:33|1:36:44|She noticed someone next to her. She saw [Doctor Liang] and immediately smiled happily.
1:37:6|1:37:16|Upon hearing Xiong Dun's words, Doctor Liang fell silent. Xiong Dun noticed this.
1:37:19|1:37:31|Doctor Liang glanced at the handbag filled with balls of yarn and handed it to Xiong Dun.
1:38:22|1:38:31|[Xiong Dun], with red eyes and a choked voice, gathered up the courage to ask this question.
1:39:15|1:39:31|Doctor Liang's voice trembled uncontrollably, tears swirling in his eyes. Upon hearing this answer, Xiong Dun's tears welled up.
1:40:48|1:40:57|Upon hearing Xiong Dun's words, Doctor Liang fought back tears and nodded slightly.
1:41:20|1:41:29|With their hearts wide open, the two people, at this moment, no longer restrain themselves and laugh heartily. [Xiong Dun] bites his lip, looking at [Doctor Liang], his eyes filled with joy.
1:41:29|1:41:33|[Doctor Liang] is no exception, never before has he laughed so heartily.
1:41:33|1:41:37|The next day, [Xiong Dun] sat on the bed and watched a boxing match with [Xiao Xia] featuring [Lao Zheng].
1:42:15|1:42:24|[Xiong Dun] is standing on the stage in a beautiful dance costume. She pinches the hem of her skirt and gestures a beautiful dance move.
1:43:11|1:43:17|[Xiong Dun], dressed in travel gear and carrying a large backpack, gazes at the magnificent and colorful aurora in front of him, shining brightly.
1:43:17|1:43:21|The ever-changing beautiful light streaks across the night sky, mysterious and dreamlike.
1:43:21|1:43:28|Finally, [Xiong Dun] reached the summit of a mountain.
1:43:30|1:43:43|The rising sun cast a golden hue over the mountains, enveloping [Xiong Dun] in its warmth. As he gazed into the distance, his eyes sparkled with a longing for life.
1:43:43|1:43:51|Even if God played a huge joke on her, [Xiong Dun] could turn it into motivation. She boldly pursues her dreams and love.
1:43:51|1:43:56|Pursuing everything they love, living vividly and passionately.
1:43:56|1:43:57|The scene changes,
1:43:57|1:44:5|[Xiong Dun] nestled in her mother's arms, her mother wearing reading glasses, knitting a sweater. She suddenly reached out and touched her mother's lips.
1:44:5|1:44:10|Mom showed a kind smile, and [Xiong Dun] also smiled and said.
1:44:14|1:44:21|His mother smiled indulgently and said.
1:44:38|1:44:44|The two exchanged a smile, and Mom adjusted her reading glasses, knitting a sweater non-stop.
1:45:2|1:45:8|Mom's eyes suddenly turned red, saying to [Xiong Dun].
1:45:13|1:45:18|[Xiong Dun] obediently agreed, and his mother lowered her head to touch [Xiong Dun]'s shoulder with concern. [Xiong Dun] stared at his mother.
1:45:18|1:45:27|With a pout and red eyes, mustering up courage, she spoke out in a tone of grievance. [Xiong Dun's Mother] held back her tears and avoided looking at her.
1:45:28|1:45:32|[Xiong Dun] restrained his emotions, tears shimmering in his eyes as he spoke.
1:45:44|1:45:50|Hearing these words, Mom couldn't control her tears anymore, sobbing uncontrollably. [Xiong Dun] continued.
1:46:19|1:46:25|[Xiong Dun]'s mother's mouth kept twitching, reaching out to hold [Xiong Dun] even tighter.
1:46:26|1:46:31|The mother and daughter held each other tightly, releasing all the painful emotions.
1:46:34|1:46:47|[Xiong Dun] buried his head deeply in his mother's arms, sobbing like a child. Since falling ill, it was the first time [Xiong Dun] cried out loud like this, disregarding everything.
1:46:47|1:46:53|At this moment, [Xiong Dun] realized that the greatest torment brought by illness was the separation from her family.
1:46:53|1:47:4|In the city, everything remains the same, factory chimneys billowing thick smoke. Vehicles on the streets come and go endlessly, no matter how bad life is, the world keeps on turning.
1:47:4|1:47:13|No matter what life throws at her, [Xiong Dun] always faces it with a smile, never being defeated. Even when life tosses her around, up and down,
1:47:13|1:47:20|She can also stand up and resist stubbornly. The scene shifts to the hospital, where Doctor Liang opens the drawer in the office.
1:47:20|1:47:29|He put the documents in his hand into the drawer. Suddenly he noticed the hand cream in the corner, picked it up and remembered it was a gift from [Xiong Dun].
1:47:29|1:47:36|He held it in his hand, turning it over and over, lost in thought. He understood [Xiong Dun]'s condition better than anyone else.
1:47:36|1:47:42|But the sudden deterioration caught everyone off guard. He couldn't control his tears and started crying.
1:47:42|1:47:50|With his hands covering his eyes, letting tears slide down his fingers. He decided to take off his eyes, covering his nose and sobbing silently. At night,
1:47:50|1:47:59|[Xiong Dun] stood on the rooftop, wearing a hat, gloves, and a scarf. She boredly exhaled white mist into the air, feeling the cold of this winter.
1:47:59|1:48:8|A gust of wind blew a plastic bag onto the rooftop, flying past [Xiong Dun] and eventually hanging on the railing, making a rustling sound in the wind.
1:48:8|1:48:21|[Xiong Dun] walked over and rescued the struggling plastic bag from the railing, then threw it into the sky. It flew further and further with the wind, eventually becoming a small dot. [Xiong Dun] stood still, watching the plastic bag fly away.
1:48:21|1:48:28|It's as if the one who just regained freedom is [Xiong Dun] himself. [Xiong Dun]'s condition is getting worse, and everyone is busy with their own tasks.
1:48:28|1:48:34|[Xiao Xia] is busy working, transformed into a workaholic, standing in the conference room, confidently presenting the plan to everyone.
1:48:34|1:48:39|[Xia Meng] is dressed in a handsome suit, standing in front of the spotlight and camera.
1:48:40|1:48:48|[Xiong Dun's Mother] sat in front of the hospital bed, tears in her eyes as she looked at [Xiong Dun], nodding at her. [Xiong Dun] knew that her time was running out.
1:48:48|1:48:58|Facing her mother with a smile, [Xiong Dun's Mother] knew her daughter was bidding her final farewell. She held back her tears, unable to conceal the pain and sorrow.
1:48:58|1:49:4|Xiao Xia, who is in a meeting at the company, suddenly seems to sense something and stops what she is doing.
1:49:4|1:49:7|During the boxing match, [Lao Zheng] suddenly became distracted while sparring with his opponent.
1:49:9|1:49:18|The opponent took advantage of the opening and landed a punch on her face. She closed her eyes in pain and fell backwards. The back of her head hit the ground, slamming heavily on the boxing ring.
1:49:18|1:49:26|Sweat dripped from his hair onto the ground. [Xia Meng], who was in the middle of filming, stood still as if his soul had left his body.
1:49:26|1:49:38|Just back from a business trip, [Ai Mi] sat in the car and suddenly looked up to see a red balloon floating in the sky. It was light and inconspicuous, easily blown by the wind in whichever direction it pleased.
1:49:38|1:49:47|It's as if everyone had a telepathic connection, sensing [Xiong Dun]'s call in his final moments of life. [Ai Mi] was running down the hospital corridor with bags in hand.
1:49:47|1:49:51|Approaching the door of Xiong Dun's ward, I couldn't help but slow down my pace.
1:49:51|1:49:55|She slowly walked forward, but saw the scene she least wanted to see.
1:49:55|1:50:5|[Xiong Dun's Parents] looked devastated, as did the flatlined heart monitor beside them, signaling the departure of [Xiong Dun]. The items in [Ai Mi]'s hands scattered on the ground in an instant.
1:50:5|1:50:13|The sunflower plush toy given to [Xiong Dun] earlier fell to the ground, still playing [Xiong Dun]'s song. [Ai Mi] sat down, hesitating to enter the ward.
1:50:13|1:50:21|She bit her finger, tears streaming down her face silently. The scene then shifted to the funeral of [Xiong Dun].
1:50:21|1:50:28|The projector on the wall displays a cartoon image based on [Xiong Dun], with the words "Bear, we miss you" written below in a cute font.
1:50:29|1:50:37|[Xiao Xia] stood on the stage, bowed to the audience below, and said.
1:50:47|1:50:52|[Xiao Xia] turned around and opened the projector behind her.
1:51:6|1:51:12|[Xiong Dun] couldn't control his tears and stopped.
1:51:42|1:51:50|[Xiong Dun] turned his head, trying hard to hold back his tears. He then used his hand to cover his face, afraid that the tears would fall. However, the tears still stubbornly rolled down.
1:51:50|1:51:59|She had to wipe away the tears with her hand. Sitting in the audience, [Xiong Dun's Mother] also cried silently along with [Xiong Dun]. After [Xiong Dun] wiped away the tears,
1:51:59|1:52:2|Struggling to control her emotions and trembling voice.
1:52:15|1:52:22|[Xiong Dun] puts his hands together. [Xiong Dun's Father] couldn't help but cry.
1:53:20|1:53:25|[Xiong Dun] covered her nose, tears streaming down again. She sniffed and forced a smile, saying, "
1:53:29|1:53:35|[Xiong Dun] laughed and cried at the same time, facing the camera, making a big scissor gesture with his hand.
