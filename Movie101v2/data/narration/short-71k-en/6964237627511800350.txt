0:4:21|0:4:35|Under the urging of Instructor [Sun], [Gu Zidi] called over soldier [Jiao Dapeng]. Instructor [Sun] took off her helmet and handed it to [Jiao Dapeng]. [Gu Zidi] asked the soldier next to him to bring smoke bombs.
0:4:36|0:5:7|[Jiao Dapeng] put on the helmet and shouted at the soldiers not far away. He gestured to [Jiang Maocai] to bring two people with him. [Gu Zidi] threw a smoke bomb onto the open road ahead. With a command from [Jiao Dapeng], they rushed out of the defensive fortifications. [Jiang Maocai] and two soldiers followed closely behind. Taking advantage of the smoke bomb's cover, the four of them ran to the cover of abandoned cars and barrels.
0:5:8|0:5:16|With guns raised in alert, after confirming safety, [Jiao Dapeng] waved his hand to signal the soldiers in the camp to set up guns to cover and escort two soldiers to join them.
0:5:16|0:5:23|He continued to signal in sign language, and the two soldiers who had just arrived covered the four who had arrived earlier to continue advancing.
0:5:26|0:5:50|Several people ran in the dilapidated town filled with smoke. As they approached the shelter, [Jiao Dapeng] and [Jiang Maocai] quickly crouched down behind the cover, while two soldiers protecting them leaned against the wall, watching the street ahead. They raised their hands to signal safety to [Jiao Dapeng], and then the group, guns in hand, continued to move forward along the building.
0:5:51|0:5:59|In the town, apart from the howling wind and distant gunfire, all that could be heard were the heavy breathing of a few people and the sound of footsteps on the snowy ground.
0:5:59|0:6:6|The creaking sound. [Jiao Dapeng] cautiously peeks out his head to observe the street behind the building wall.
0:6:7|0:6:17|He whistled to the soldiers behind him, then signaled for six people to split into two groups and advance cautiously.
0:6:17|0:6:23|The group moved forward slowly, cautiously vigilant of the surrounding buildings.
0:6:54|0:7:11|Suddenly a soldier raised his hand to signal everyone to stop advancing. Before the soldier could lower his hand, a gunshot rang out. [Jiang Maocai] located the position by the sound, turned around, and fired a shot, directly killing the enemy sniper. The battle then began.
0:7:15|0:7:33|Ambushed from above, the enemy set up machine guns and fired at the soldiers below. The soldiers quickly took cover, with [Jiang Maocai] flipping over and hiding behind a brick wall. Bullets from the enemy followed closely, pouring onto the brick wall, creating a cloud of smoke and dust. The enemy from above continued to suppress with relentless firepower, leaving [Jiao Dapeng] and others crouching helplessly behind cover.
0:7:33|0:8:4|Another soldier was hit and lay horizontally in the snow between two rocks. Before [Jiao Dapeng] could pull him into cover, the enemy's machine gun started firing wildly. The soldier immediately lost his breath. In a split second, two of [Jiao Dapeng]'s men sacrificed their lives. Behind cover, [Jiao Dapeng] roared madly, and [Jiang Maocai] immediately popped up and fired several shots.
0:8:4|0:8:19|As an enemy fell, with enemy firepower suppressing [Jiang Maocai] and preventing him from firing, [Gu Zidi] arrived with a large force. With the numerical advantage, the Ninth Company continuously fired at the enemy, instantly turning the situation around.
0:8:21|0:8:36|Platoon Leader Gu Zidi fired his gun while knocking down the enemies hiding in the civilian houses, shouting loudly, "The soldiers of the Ninth Company are madly shooting at the buildings ahead."
0:8:54|0:9:36|Seeing no movement from the enemy, [Gu Zidi] ordered the soldiers to rescue the wounded. [Instructor] led a row of soldiers charging towards the enemy-occupied area. Just as [Gu Zidi] ordered the soldiers to disperse and take positions, the enemy hidden in the dark pressed the detonator. Explosions started happening one after another around the soldiers, causing them to fall in the blasts. [Gu Zidi] ordered the second and third rows to retreat, while he himself moved forward to rescue the wounded.
0:9:37|0:9:45|He dragged the soldier whose right arm had been blown off, moving him to the wall with difficulty, [Gu Zidi] shouted anxiously,
0:9:51|0:10:13|The explosion continued, and there was a conflict in command between Instructor Sun and Gu Zidi. Instructor Sun pulled Jiao Dapeng, who was lying on the ground avoiding the explosion, and led the remaining soldiers to continue advancing. Jiao Dapeng rolled over and shot off the enemy's arm holding the grenade.
0:10:15|0:10:22|[Gu Zidi] saw a row trapped in an ambush and fighting hard, shouting:
0:10:28|0:10:42|The explosion caused immense damage, with most of the injured soldiers losing limbs and lying on the ground in a pool of blood. [Instructor Sun], seeing that the enemy position had not been taken, took the lead and ordered the soldiers to charge forward.
0:10:45|0:11:16|[Jiao Dapeng] hid behind the abandoned car, he called [Lv Kuangou] and [Jiang Maocai] to flank and destroy the enemy's heavy weapons. On the other side, [Sun Instructor] led the soldiers to charge outside the enemy's position, [Gu Zidi] also rushed over with reinforcements. [Gu Zidi] ordered the soldiers to take cover and lie down, but [Sun Instructor] anxiously shouted for the soldiers to charge forward. The enemy's heavy machine guns relentlessly fired at the frontline position, and the charging soldiers became direct targets.
0:11:19|0:11:44|Just as the machine gunners on both sides were in a standoff, [Lv Kuangou] and [Jiang Maocai] sneaked into the enemy's position. After taking out the enemies who were shooting at them wildly, the two continued to advance. Their goal was to destroy the enemy's artillery position, which posed a great threat to the Ninth Company. With the continuous bombardment from the enemy, the soldiers couldn't advance at all.
0:12:3|0:12:14|Under the suppression of enemy heavy machine guns and artillery, the bodies of the soldiers from the Ninth Company have covered the entire frontline. Anxious and furious, Instructor Sun shouted loudly at Gu Zidi.
0:12:23|0:12:56|In the time it took for the two to talk, the enemy adjusted the angle of the cannon, and a shot hit the brick wall where [Instructor Sun] was hiding. The wall collapsed with a bang, dust flying everywhere. [Gu Zidi] shouted and ran towards the instructor, while on the other side, with the cover of [Jiang Maocai], [Lv Kuangou] had already reached near the cannon. [Lv Kuangou] pulled out the fuse, threw the explosive pack onto the cannon on the second floor.
0:12:56|0:13:6|Unfortunately, the timing was not calculated correctly. The enemy was about to throw a grenade downstairs, but [Jiang Maocai] shot and killed him with one shot, destroying the enemy's cannon.
0:13:11|0:13:30|The soldiers of the Ninth Company launched a fearless charge, with [Gu Zidi] holding [Instructor Sun] and covering his shattered lower body with a hat, feeling heartbroken. In the confusion of [Gu Zidi] and [Jiao Dapeng], Instructor Sun's eyes gradually lost their luster.
0:13:46|0:14:18|[Jiao Dapeng] watched as the instructor, who had died a gruesome death, spat on the ground and turned away. He strode aggressively towards the captured enemy soldiers, loaded his rifle, and shouted: The enemy leader did not understand [Jiao Dapeng]'s intentions, but seeing his serious expression, reluctantly picked up the gun. With one shot, [Jiao Dapeng] pierced him through, causing a commotion among the captives. Ignoring the chaos, [Jiao Dapeng] continued to shout,
0:14:20|0:14:34|The soldier nicknamed Luozi held a machine gun and looked at the surrendered enemy in front of him. [Luo Guangtian] replied, "The enemy is trembling on the ground," as [Jiao Dapeng] continued to shout:
0:14:50|0:14:59|In the astonished eyes of the soldiers, [Gu Zidi] burst into tears, but in the end, they couldn't bring themselves to shoot the captive in front of them.
0:15:10|0:15:15|[Jiao Dapeng] walked into the clinic and placed his gun on the table.
0:15:17|0:15:26|Leaning against the cabinet, flipping through the small book in his hand, [Gu Zidi] said,
0:16:2|0:16:33|The scene shifts to the warehouse where prisoners are being held. The prisoners are squatting on the ground, holding their heads. Soldiers from the Ninth Company are taking the clothes stripped from the prisoners and putting them on themselves. [Gu Zidi] pushes a wheel in and says to everyone, while [Jiao Dapeng] squatting on the side complains:
0:17:39|0:18:21|The confinement room is a granary, and [Gu Zidi] is sleeping on a pile of grass. A hand gently pushes him and calls out: [Gu Zidi] wakes up groggily, turns around, and looks at the person. He feels a bit lost. The man ignores him, goes back to sit on the grass mound, and starts writing and drawing in a small notebook with a pen.
0:18:32|0:18:43|[Gu Zidi] stood up and brushed off the grass on his body, asking: He brought a bowl of steamed potatoes and sat down next to the man.
0:19:18|0:19:26|[Wang Jincun] remained silent, burying his head deeply.
0:19:31|0:19:36|[Gu Zidi] walked to the middle of the granary while eating potatoes and said:
0:19:43|0:19:57|The scene shifts to outside the granary, where a soldier with a military cap around his waist is carrying a basin of water and walking forward. Inside the house, Captain [Liu Zeshui] is soaking his feet, enduring the pain of cracked soles, and saying:
0:20:38|0:20:44|Liu Zeshui saw that he was not moving, shouted, Gu Zidi drank a gulp of white wine, and put down his chopsticks.
0:20:48|0:20:56|[Liu Zeshui] soaked his feet, sat by the stove to dry his damp military boots. [Gu Zidi] also sat down and picked up a boot, saying:
0:22:55|0:23:15|[Gu Zidi] thought for a moment and asked again, [Liu Zeshui] was about to scold him, but stopped himself before the words came out.
0:23:32|0:23:38|[Xiao Liangzi] took out the remaining half cigarette and handed it over.
0:23:58|0:24:9|[Gu Zidi] picked up a piece of charcoal with pliers and lit the cigarette in his mouth. [Liu Zeshui] stared at him intently for a while and said,
0:25:18|0:25:28|The scene then shifts to the morning march, with the soldiers of the Ninth Company fully armed, holding torches and weapons and ammunition, walking towards the old kiln site.
0:25:29|0:25:51|[Gu Zidi] looked anxiously at the soldiers beside him. As the soldiers passed by one by one, [Gu Zidi] reached the end of the line. The light of the torches enveloped his rough face, and the mist he exhaled intertwined with the flames, stirred up, and then carried away by the cold wind, silent and invisible.
0:25:51|0:26:4|[Gu Zidi] took two steps with the team, then stopped again, looked back at the regimental headquarters, and saw the Ninth Company's team gradually moving away. [Gu Zidi] snapped out of it and caught up.
0:26:8|0:26:21|On the south bank of the Wen River, at the old kiln position, soldiers are busy perfecting fortifications and setting up weapons. The 47 soldiers of the Ninth Company are each performing their duties, with [Gu Zidi] holding a telescope to observe the opposite bank of the river.
0:26:30|0:26:46|Four soldiers were pushing and pulling to hide the mountain cannon. Inside the old cave, the soldiers were moving detonators and explosives. [Jiao Dapeng] packed the explosives and continued to walk outside. He bent over and walked out of the cave, saying,
0:28:1|0:28:13|The person who arrived is [Wang Jincun], he looked cautious and awkward, took the briefcase and submachine gun handed to him by [Gu Zidi], and the soldiers of the Ninth Company stopped their work when they heard [Gu Zidi]'s shout.
0:28:22|0:28:29|[Gu Zidi] listened to the sparse applause of the crowd and said, "Let the applause get warmer."
0:29:7|0:29:29|[Wang Jincun] nodded with a smile, before he could speak, enemy shells started raining down. The bombardment was intense and fierce. [Gu Zidi] shouted for the soldiers to hide in the caves, while he protected [Wang Jincun] as they crouched in the trench.
0:29:37|0:29:59|[Jiao Dapeng] pulled [Wang Jincun] and ran towards the direction of the cave, while the shells kept hitting the position, throwing up soil and grass in the air. The position seemed to be wrapped in soil, and [Wang Jincun] was stunned by the huge explosion. [Jiao Dapeng] shook him hard, urging him to get up and keep running. Soldiers entered the cave one after another, and [Jiao Dapeng] dragged [Wang Jincun] in to hide.
0:30:0|0:30:14|[Wang Jincun] was lying on the ground, rolling and crawling, holding his head and not daring to look up. He furrowed his brows, clasped his hands together, and muttered something under his breath.
0:30:33|0:31:6|Luo Guangtian discontentedly patted Lv Kuangou, who was joking around. Jiao Dapeng, accustomed to such scenes, took out his dry rations and ate them while watching Wang Jincun, who was shivering. He offered his rations to Wang Jincun, who shook his head indicating he didn't need them. Wang Jincun rubbed the dust off his glasses without answering, as the shells continued to bombard the position.
0:31:7|0:31:22|The explosion splashed sand and snow mixed with flames, pouring down on the position. At the entrance of the cave, a soldier was dragged inside, and the surrounding soldiers quickly crowded around to check on the wounded. [Gu Zidi] said to everyone,
0:31:30|0:31:34|The enemy's bombardment is still ongoing, but the density of the shells has greatly decreased.
0:31:36|0:31:51|The position gradually stabilized, with only the holes all over the ground and the lingering smoke of gunpowder. In the cave, [Gu Zidi] tidied up his equipment, took out his pocket watch and shook it fiercely. He said:
0:32:7|0:32:24|At his command, the soldiers checked their weapons and prepared for battle. They cautiously made their way to the trenches, taking up positions and keeping a close eye on the enemy forces approaching the position. The situation was on the brink of erupting into conflict.
0:32:24|0:32:55|In the cave, [Jiao Dapeng] walked up to [Gu Zidi] and whispered in his ear: [Jiao Dapeng] nodded, picked up his gun and walked out. The soldiers outside, facing the densely packed enemies, were all on edge. [Lv Kuangou] and [Jiang Maocai] nervously aimed at the enemies. [Jiao Dapeng] rushed to the forefront of the fortifications, and dove behind cover.
0:32:55|0:33:4|He peeked out and looked at the enemy, saying, "In the cave, [Gu Zidi] spoke up:"
0:33:25|0:33:51|[Gu Zidi] gave his helmet to [Wang Jincun], picked up his gun and walked out of the cave. Accidentally, [Wang Jincun] caught a glimpse of the soldier's body that had just sacrificed, he quickly squeezed his eyes shut, turned his head, wanting to shout to boost his courage, but found himself too scared to make a sound.
0:33:54|0:34:8|[Gu Zidi] arrived at the trench, observed the enemy with binoculars for a while, and found that there were many of them. He quickly moved around in the trench, preparing to command the battle.
0:34:12|0:34:23|He jogged all the way to the vicinity of the mortar position and stopped to observe. [Gu Zidi] lit a cigarette, panting, and placed a hand grenade in a convenient position, ready for action.
0:34:23|0:34:31|At this moment, as the enemy is getting closer to the position, the soldiers are nervously preparing. [Gu Zidi] takes a drag of his cigarette, unscrews the hand grenade, and pulls out the fuse.
0:34:32|0:34:41|As the cigarette in Gu Zidi's mouth burns shorter and shorter, the enemy gets closer to the position. Lv Kuangou says to Jiang Maocai,
0:34:48|0:35:25|The enemy is getting closer to the position, but [Gu Zidi] still hasn't given the attack order. The battlefield is filled only with the sound of the enemy's approaching footsteps. Watching the enemy getting closer and closer, [Gu Zidi] crushes the cigarette on the ground and shouts: The war begins in an instant. The enemy at the front is caught off guard, first by a wave of grenades, then by a round of gunfire from the hidden soldiers.
0:35:26|0:35:34|The enemy fell down like grass being cut, and the soldiers of the Ninth Company launched a full attack, with countless tongues of fire rushing towards the enemy in front of them.
0:35:36|0:36:2|Bullets pierced through the enemies, splattering blood on the snowy ground. Despite being ambushed, the enemy forces remained strong and continued to advance in waves towards the position. The battlefield was chaotic, explosions throwing up dust and debris, burning ashes floating in the air. Just as Gu Zidi set up the mortar, Wang Jincun rushed out of the cave with a box of explosives.
0:36:3|0:36:28|[Gu Zidi] called him over, looking at [Wang Jincun] who was covering his helmet in confusion. He said, "On the other side, the enemy commander shouted: '...'". After that, he led his troops to charge. In the chaotic battlefield, [Jiang Maocai] kept his eyes on the enemy officer. He stood up, aimed, and with a gunshot, the officer fell to the ground. [Jiang Maocai] pulled back behind cover and said: "..."
0:36:35|0:37:3|Five artillery guns fired at the position, instantly suppressing the soldiers of the Ninth Company. One after another, shells exploded on the fortifications, forcing the soldiers to dodge the shells and shoot back at the enemy. The enemy launched a fierce attack on the position. [Gu Zidi] ran to the medic, pulled him up, and rushed towards the injured soldiers. Along the way, soldiers kept getting shot and falling to the ground, with blood mixing with mud, dust, and snow seeping into the sandbags.
0:37:3|0:37:15|The soldier who was shot lost consciousness and fell on [Gu Zidi] behind him. Without time for grief, [Gu Zidi] decisively gave orders and then continued on the road.
0:37:17|0:37:44|The artillery fire continued, and the soldiers killed and sacrificed were covered in blood and flesh. [Wang Jincun] was terrified, running frantically in the trench, just as [Gu Zidi] had warned him, shells chasing after the cowardly. Those shells were all chasing [Wang Jincun], exploding around him. He collapsed on the slope, turned his head and saw a bloody, flesh-covered corpse beside him.
0:37:44|0:37:54|[Wang Jincun] struggled to get up and continued to flee, a bomb exploded behind him, and [Wang Jincun] fell to the ground screaming.
0:37:56|0:38:8|His screams were abruptly cut off by another explosion nearby, and a soldier next to [Wang Jincun] had his leg blown off. The explosion's dust almost buried the two of them.
0:38:8|0:38:26|While Wang Jincun was staring blankly at the body of a soldier next to him, Blackie, who was transporting explosives, was hit in the neck by an enemy shell. Blood gushed from his neck and Blackie instantly collapsed on the ground, leaving Wang Jincun on the verge of a breakdown.
0:38:28|0:38:51|Arriving to rescue the wounded, [Gu Zidi] and the medic lay Blackie flat. Looking at the already lifeless [Wang Jincun] and the fading life of Blackie, [Gu Zidi] asked the medic for a roll of bandage, got up and walked to [Wang Jincun], pressing it heavily on his hand. Ordering him, [Wang Jincun] staggered to Blackie. With no extra time, [Gu Zidi] returned to the mortar position.
0:38:52|0:38:59|Lit the fuse of the homemade mortar that had been prepared for a long time. This makeshift mortar was no match for the enemy's proper infantry cannon.
0:39:0|0:39:11|The power and range are far apart, and [Gu Zidi] can only wait helplessly until the enemy gets close enough to fire. Fortunately, with the loud noise and smoke rising on the battlefield, the sound of cannons is continuous.
0:39:11|0:39:31|At one point, they unexpectedly defeated the enemy. The soldiers took advantage of the victory and climbed out of the trenches to launch a frenzied attack. In the chaos, the enemy retreated. [Gu Zidi], who had lost many brothers in the battle, felt uneasy. He shouted for everyone to stop the attack and save ammunition.
0:39:32|0:39:56|With the enemy retreating, the difficult first wave of ambush was finally over. Amidst the vast smoke on the snowy battlefield in the early morning, the exhausted Ninth Company was cleaning up the battlefield. [Gu Zidi] dragged the fallen soldiers back to the trenches, then walked towards the wounded soldiers. He handed the soldier who hadn't finished smoking the cigarette in his mouth, patted his shoulder, and left.
0:39:56|0:40:4|[Gu Zidi] walked up to [Old Ciwei], who was washing his face with snow and ice, and said:
0:40:12|0:40:18|He sat by the fire and took the steamed bun handed to him by [Jiao Dapeng], roasting it on the fire.
0:41:11|0:41:39|[Gu Zidi] stared at the steamed buns that had turned golden on the fire, then looked at [Wang Jincun] who was still kneeling beside Blackie's body. [Gu Zidi] stood up and walked towards him. [Wang Jincun] remained motionless, just kneeling beside the body sobbing. [Gu Zidi] slowly approached him from behind, gently placed a hand on his shoulder, and then walked to the body to close Blackie's eyes.
0:41:40|0:42:17|Watching the wound on Heizi's neck, he continued, "[Gu Zidi] felt around on Heizi's body and said, 'In the pocket on Heizi's chest,' [Gu Zidi] took out a letter stained red with blood and handed it to [Wang Jincun]. [Wang Jincun] took the family letter and solemnly placed it in the pocket on his chest. [Gu Zidi] shouted into Heizi's ear:"
0:42:22|0:42:29|The scene shifts to a grassland littered with corpses,
0:42:41|0:43:9|Lv Kuangou and Jiang Maocai crawled carefully in the pile of corpses, collecting supplies and searching for the officer who had just been killed. They opened a body to check the identity. Jiang Maocai fiddled with the helmet of the corpse and said after a glance, "The scene returns to the cave."
0:43:19|0:43:26|He poured gasoline into a glass bottle to soak the cloth used for ignition, while talking about the contents of a letter from home.
0:43:34|0:43:38|[Wang Jincun] is covered in mud and coal dust, but remains calm.
0:43:44|0:44:1|[Wang Jincun] didn't stop writing, he said to [Jiao Dapeng] while writing: The scene is back on the battlefield.
0:44:17|0:44:55|[Jiang Maocai] discovered the body of the officer and, somewhat excited, said to [Lv Kuangou]. [Lv Kuangou] crawled towards the officer's body, [Jiang Maocai] loaded the gun, then covered for him. [Lv Kuangou] began to search the body, and after finishing, excitedly took off the watch. He wiped the dial, confirmed the watch was working properly, grinned, and muttered: Just as he was about to return, a gunshot rang out, a bullet piercing through his chest, causing him to fall to the ground.
0:44:56|0:45:7|He struggled to pick up the watch, but the enemy shot his arm again. [Jiang Maocai] located the enemy's position and took a shot to the head, resolving the enemy.
0:45:8|0:45:34|He was extremely anxious, got up and ran towards [Lv Kuangou]. [Lv Kuangou] was lying on the ground, tightly clutching the watch. He was steaming hot, but his eyes had already lost focus. [Jiang Maocai] didn't dare to delay, despite his small stature, he carried the sturdy [Lv Kuangou] and walked quickly.
0:45:34|0:45:53|Upon hearing the news that [Lv Kuangou] was shot, [Gu Zidi] disregarded the winding trenches and ran across the flat ground, rushing towards the scene. As he arrived, [Gu Zidi] quickly pulled [Jiao Dapeng] aside.
0:46:2|0:46:19|[Gu Zidi] pulled down the watch, stood up panting in frustration. At this moment, [Jiao Dapeng] shouted: [Gu Zidi] quickly picked up the binoculars to look, sure enough, the enemy tanks were advancing towards the position.
0:46:36|0:46:47|Two tanks rolled forward with their tracks directly towards the position. On the tanks, two machine gunners were on high alert, the only weapons that the Ninth Company could rely on to deal with tanks were small mountain cannons and explosives.
0:46:49|0:47:16|The tanks roared closer to the position, with [Gu Zidi] and [Wang Jincun] operating the small mountain cannon together. The soldiers of the Ninth Company were also ready for battle, waiting for the tanks to enter the attack range. Inside the cave, [Lv Kuangou] weakly asked:
0:47:41|0:48:16|[Gu Zidi] adjusted the angle and fired at the tank, but missed the enemy twice in a row. The tank turned its turret and fired a shot near [Gu Zidi], instantly leveling the brick wall behind him. The bricks were blasted into the sky like bits of straw, leaving [Gu Zidi] deaf in one ear from the explosion. He stood behind the mountain cannon, shaking his head blankly, squinting and swaying as he looked towards [Wang Jincun].
0:48:16|0:48:22|He found that he was shouting at himself, but he couldn't hear anything.
0:48:27|0:48:35|The tank's shelling continued, leaving the soldiers with almost no room to fight back. Those hit by the shelling were blown apart, turning into bloody pieces of flesh.
0:48:38|0:49:3|Due to the suppression of tanks, the enemy machine gunners fired at the soldiers in the camp without hesitation. The battlefield turned into a one-sided massacre, with the mortar positions turning into ruins under the enemy's intense bombardment. Countless soldiers were shot before they could escape, and were shattered by the explosions. The ground, covered with ice and snow in the early morning, is now a scorched earth. On the other side, [Gu Zidi] supported the mountain cannon and watched the approaching tanks.
0:49:3|0:49:10|He regained some consciousness and, recovering his strength, [Gu Zidi] continued to aim at the tank.
0:49:15|0:49:43|From a determined angle, [Gu Zidi] waved his hand and shouted loudly: watching the tank being hit and bursting into flames, [Wang Jincun] excitedly yelled that the mountain cannon had run out of shells, while another tank was still approaching. A tank shell blasted the machine gun position above the cave, causing bricks to fall and dust to fly. In the midst of this chaos, [Jiang Maocai] walked out of the cave.
0:49:43|0:49:53|He stopped in his tracks, looked back at the lifeless Lv Kuangou in the cave dwelling, as the shell exploded beside him, he remained unfazed.
0:49:56|0:50:17|[Jiao Dapeng] took the torch and Molotov cocktail, charging towards the front line amidst the flying bullets. In the midst of the battle, he saw [Jiang Maocai] being overturned in the trench, but he couldn't spare the time to rescue him. With two soldiers, [Jiao Dapeng] rushed to the edge of the position with the Molotov cocktail and torch, reaching the flank of the tank. Hiding in the trench, he shouted loudly to [Luo Guangtian]:
0:50:24|0:50:52|[Jiao Dapeng] lit a Molotov cocktail and said to the soldiers: Immediately, three fearless individuals rushed out of the trench towards the tank, the machine gunner crazily firing at them. Upon seeing this, [Wang Jincun] picked up a rifle, crouched outside the trench, and shot the machine gunner. [Gu Zidi] rushed over, pulled [Wang Jincun] back into the trench, and just then a barrage of bullets swept through the spot where [Wang Jincun] had just been. On the other side,
0:50:52|0:50:58|The soldier who threw the Molotov cocktail was tortured to death by the enemy in the tank, with dozens of bullets stuck in his bloody flesh.
0:50:58|0:51:28|Soldiers were being run over by tanks directly, the burning flames on the tracks were their final effort. In the trench, [Jiang Maocai] struggled to prop up his body, the sand and lime on his back rolled down loosely. He stood up with his rifle, staring fiercely at the tank in front of him, moving forward with great difficulty. On the other side, [Jiao Dapeng] was still grappling with the tank, while everyone shouted in worry.
0:51:34|0:51:38|The tank roared, closely chasing Jiao Dapeng, the machine gun hit Jiao Dapeng who was about to throw a Molotov cocktail.
0:51:41|0:52:3|The impact forced [Jiao Dapeng] to fall into the trench, and [Jiang Maocai], who was moving towards the tank, was hit by machine gun fire and fell to the ground covered in blood. In the trench, [Jiao Dapeng] ignored the pain, picked up a Molotov cocktail to throw, but the enemy unexpectedly smashed the Molotov cocktail in his hand. Gasoline and flames instantly engulfed [Jiao Dapeng].
0:52:5|0:52:16|The flames were burning fiercely, [Jiao Dapeng] shouted with all his might, frantically beating and hitting the flames on his body, only to helplessly realize that it was all in vain.
0:52:17|0:52:29|Hearing Jiao Dapeng's screams, Jiang Maocai struggled to stand up and walked towards the tank. Blood was flowing from his body, which was in ruins, but he continued to approach the tank.
0:52:39|0:52:52|Accompanied by the cries of his comrades and the deafening explosion, [Jiang Maocai] disappeared into the rolling heat wave along with the tank, finally bringing the second wave of counterattacks to an end.
0:52:52|0:53:11|[Gu Zidi] brought three soldiers holding the four corners of a blanket, carrying the severely burned [Jiao Dapeng] back to the rear of the position. [Gu Zidi] pinched a cigarette and let [Jiao Dapeng] take a puff. [Jiao Dapeng] struggled to open his mouth and said to [Gu Zidi]:
0:54:2|0:54:17|[Gu Zidi] watched as [Old Ciwei] stood still for a moment, then he got up and started asking the surrounding soldiers,
0:54:22|0:54:31|The soldiers did not answer, they just stared blankly at [Gu Zidi].
0:54:45|0:54:54|[Wang Jincun] stood still in shock when he heard the news.
0:55:16|0:55:56|[Gu Zidi] was at a loss, he glanced at [Old Ciwei] and shouted to [Wang Jincun]: "Avoid eye contact with [Old Ciwei." [Wang Jincun] swallowed and replied: [Old Ciwei] stood up and cursed loudly. He raised his gun and pointed it at [Wang Jincun's] head. [Gu Zidi] grabbed the gun and pointed it at his own head. [Luo Guangtian] kicked down [Old Ciwei], who yelled:
0:56:24|0:56:42|[Jiao Dapeng] finally couldn't hold on and sacrificed himself. His departure temporarily calmed everyone down. [Gu Zidi] knelt on the ground and said in a low voice:
0:57:0|0:57:12|The soldiers carefully carried away [Jiao Dapeng]. The position was in ruins, with the smell of gunpowder lingering in the air. [Gu Zidi] said to the people around him:
0:57:31|0:57:52|Old Ciwei knocked the letter out of Wang Jincun's hand and turned his head away, no longer looking at him. By nightfall, long past the scheduled retreat time of midnight, under the cover of darkness, the enemy had all gathered towards the position. They had entered the trenches of the Ninth Company, vigilantly watching their surroundings.
0:57:52|0:58:0|At night on the battlefield, eerily quiet, the enemy advancing cautiously step by step in the forefront position of the Ninth Company.
0:58:32|0:59:1|At this moment, all the explosives of the Ninth Company exploded in the enemy's camp, one after another huge fireworks illuminated the entire camp, the enemy frantically fled, the explosion lifted sand, dust mixed with blood, limbs flew into the air, and then fell to the ground. [Gu Zidi] took the lead, the soldiers charged forward, the fire reflected on [Wang Jincun]'s face, the young man looked tense,
0:59:1|0:59:13|He looked somewhat ferocious, roaring and charging towards the battlefield with a gun in hand. After the fierce battle, all soldiers of the Third Battalion, Ninth Company were killed, with only Gu Zidi surviving.
0:59:13|0:59:18|When the People's Liberation Army found him, [Gu Zidi] was wearing enemy uniform, heavily injured and unconscious.
0:59:39|0:59:56|Three months have passed since the Battle of Wenhe River. Doctor Zhang walks up to Gu Zidi and smiles, saying, "Gu Zidi, picking at the food in the box."
1:0:55|1:1:9|[Gu Zidi] finished scolding, sat back on the bed to continue eating, [Director Liu] escorted the wounded soldier from the next bed, sat down and looked at [Gu Zidi] who was eating, and kindly said to him:
1:2:38|1:2:59|Director Liu watched as Gu Zidi lowered his head, so he continued to advise him. Seeing that Director Liu still didn't believe in himself, Gu Zidi fell silent while chewing on noodles. After Director Liu finished speaking and left, a soldier outside the door shouted:
1:3:10|1:3:33|[Gu Zidi] stood up and shouted. The scene shifted to an artillery camp where [Gu Zidi] leaned against the rail of a military vehicle, curiously watching the soldiers and cannons around him. The artillery troops were undergoing training, with a series of numbers entering [Gu Zidi]'s ears, but he couldn't make sense of it at all. The military vehicle stopped in front of a large horse stable.
1:4:9|1:4:29|Platoon Leader Zhao Erdou chewed on a pancake, walked up to Gu Zidi and sat down in front of him, asking, "Gu Zidi, why so quiet?" Gu Zidi looked at Zhao Erdou without saying a word, then suddenly felt a sense of familiarity.
1:4:48|1:4:54|After Zhao Erdou finished speaking, he took out a piece of pancake from his pocket and started munching on it. Gu Zidi couldn't help but burst into laughter.
1:5:2|1:5:19|As Gu Zidi spoke, his face turned serious. He remembered Jiao Dapeng and the soldiers of the Ninth Company who sacrificed their lives. The atmosphere became solemn. Zhao Erdou turned to Squad Leader Cao and said,
1:5:23|1:5:47|Time flies, and we arrive in Hengcheng County in central Korea in 1951. Similar to the Battle of Won River, at this moment, [Gu Zidi] has become the cook under [Zhao Erdou]. He is carrying a shoulder pole to deliver supplies to [Zhao Erdou]'s command post. Hanging up the phone, [Zhao Erdou] says:
1:6:24|1:6:47|[Zhao Erdou] smiled and cursed at Squad Leader Cao, then changed into enemy uniforms with [Gu Zidi]. They took two soldiers to the observation point. A truck full of American soldiers drove past on the road, kicking up snow. [Gu Zidi] peeked out from the trees on the low slope by the roadside, observed for a moment, confirmed safety, then turned his head to signal the other three to continue on their way.
1:6:47|1:7:4|[Zhao Erdou] and the soldiers carried radios and rangefinders on their backs, crawling out of the weeds and running across the road. [Gu Zidi] stood on the road, holding a gun on guard. [Zhao Erdou] crossed the road and walked into the field. Suddenly, there was a crack under his feet. [Zhao Erdou] stopped, lowered his head and cursed:
1:7:10|1:7:30|[Gu Zidi] stopped the actions of the other two soldiers, who carefully retreated to the road and watched as [Gu Zidi] approached. [Zhao Erdou] shouted, "[Gu Zidi], while talking, carefully squatted down beside [Zhao Erdou's] feet."
1:7:37|1:8:2|[Gu Zidi] gently pushed aside the snow under [Zhao Erdou]'s feet, revealing a part of the landmine. The vigilant soldier suddenly shouted, as [Zhao Erdou] loaded his gun and said, [Gu Zidi] thought for a moment, then tapped his helmet and said, "..." Afterwards, he lay down on the ground and said, "..."
1:8:5|1:8:18|At the end of the road, the American tank was slowly approaching them. [Gu Zidi] lit a cigarette and put it in [Zhao Erdou]'s mouth. The two of them paused and waited for the arrival of the American tank.
1:8:18|1:8:52|On the tank, American soldiers spotted them and the soldier reported to the officer that there was a situation ahead. The soldiers immediately prepared for battle. The officer used binoculars to observe [Gu Zidi] and the others, realizing they were wearing Allied uniforms. He indicated to the soldiers to lower their guns and continue forward. The tank slowly moved closer to [Gu Zidi] and the others, coming to a gradual stop in front of the four. The American officer casually saluted and asked:
1:8:55|1:8:57|[Gu Zidi] waved his hand near his ear, indicating that he couldn't understand.
1:8:58|1:9:4|The American military officer jumped down from the tank and pointed at the map, asking them how to get to Hangcheng County.
1:9:18|1:9:44|The American officer who looked down was startled, and the enemies on the tank immediately raised their guns to alert. The officer turned back to explain the situation to the American soldiers, asking them to put down their guns. [Gu Zidi] no longer paid attention to the enemies, crouching on the ground to dig up landmines. The officer squatted beside him, sighing at the experiences of a few people. Pointing at the landmine, the officer indicated that it was a French anti-infantry landmine.
1:10:2|1:10:15|[Gu Zidi] encountered more troubles than most of them, then he shouted to his subordinates to continue on the road. The tank immediately started, its tracks turning, accompanied by the roar of the engine and the thick exhaust fumes, the tank convoy left the minefield.
1:10:17|1:10:46|Watching the tank of the [美军中尉] depart, the hearts of the four individuals seemed to relax a bit. They watched as the tank left, two soldiers continued to keep watch around them. [Gu Zidi] took off his boots and placed them aside to support something, he removed his gloves and held a military knife against the side of [Zhao Erdou]'s shoe. Supporting [Zhao Erdou]'s foot, he said to him: Then [Gu Zidi] exerted force to embed the knife into the sole of the shoe. [Gu Zidi] panted and ignored him, while [Zhao Erdou] stood still, not daring to move an inch.
1:11:55|1:12:14|[Zhao Erdou] interrupted [Gu Zidi]'s words and paused for a while before saying, "[Gu Zidi]," holding a military knife, said to him. [Zhao Erdou] looked deeply at [Gu Zidi] crouching in front of him, sighed, and ultimately decided to prioritize the mission, then left.
1:12:15|1:12:36|On the vast snowy field, [Zhao Erdou] rushed towards the observation point with two soldiers, while [Gu Zidi] crouched down, observing the landmines in front of him. He closed his eyes and let out a deep sigh, as time passed by second by second. A thin layer of frost accumulated on [Gu Zidi]'s helmet, and even his beard was dotted with snowflakes.
1:12:37|1:12:58|At the same time, after a brief trek, [Zhao Erdou] led the soldiers to the observation point. The Hengcheng Bridge stood not far from them. Three people crawled behind a dirt slope, with a soldier holding a gun on guard. [Zhao Erdou] took out binoculars, confirmed the position of the [American troops] on the bridge, set up instruments with another soldier, and began observing and calculating the distance.
1:13:9|1:13:37|The first shot was slightly off target, but after adjustment, it hit accurately, with shells pouring down, destroying the enemy tanks and blowing up the Hengcheng Bridge. The mission was successfully completed. At this moment, [Gu Zidi] closed his eyes, his face already covered with frost.
1:13:51|1:14:24|In a trance, [Gu Zidi] returned to the battlefield of Wenhe River, where he saw his brothers again. With regret and longing, [Gu Zidi] released the hand grenade and as the explosion sounded, the scene gradually faded away. The river water became clear, and women were washing clothes on the riverbank. This was the Wenhe River battlefield four years later, the war had ended, and here, the mountains and waters were peaceful.
1:14:24|1:14:46|Spanning the Wen River is the bridge that [Gu Zidi] once stood on years ago, when he was ordered to intercept. The bus slowly stops under the bridge, a soldier gets off and walks to the edge of the bridge to gaze back. With a backpack on his back, he walks slowly to the bridge, where the green waters and mountains in his memory are actually a land of corpses and blood, scorched earth and snow.
1:14:46|1:14:54|The soldier turned around, and in the frame appeared [Gu Zidi] with one eye blown out.
1:14:54|1:14:59|After the victory of the Korean War, he chose to return to the old site of Wenhe to find his sacrificed brothers.
1:15:44|1:15:53|The armed unit responsible for collecting firearms discovered an unknown old gun. While they were troubled, [Gu Zidi] approached them to inquire about the old army unit.
1:16:21|1:16:34|[Gu Zidi] recognized them at a glance and explained to them. Suddenly, as [Gu Zidi] was playing with the firearms, he heard a woman's voice behind him.
1:16:56|1:17:10|[Gu Zidi] patted the woman's shoulder and said, "The woman had two twisted braids, looking a bit thin. She gazed softly at [Gu Zidi]."
1:17:22|1:17:28|Accompanied by Director Liu of the Armed Forces Department, [Gu Zidi] arrived at a mine with a woman.
1:17:36|1:17:51|Said [Director Zhu] took three people to the abandoned kiln cave. The current abandoned kiln cave has become the dormitory for the miners. [Gu Zidi] groped his way in. There were many old helmets at the mine entrance, but it was not the cave where the soldiers of the Ninth Company were buried.
1:17:52|1:18:12|[Gu Zidi] felt a bit lost. Just as he was about to leave, he noticed a helmet on the ground. [Gu Zidi] picked up the helmet and found it filled with murky liquid. He took a sniff, the smell was pungent, making him cough up some spit. [Gu Zidi] walked out of the cave and shook his head as he looked at the others.
1:18:40|1:18:50|[Gu Zidi] walked towards [Zhao Erdou] with a helmet in hand. He approached [Zhao Erdou] and handed the helmet to him, asking: "Was this helmet dug out from here?"
1:19:24|1:19:32|[Gu Zidi] roared angrily, he poured out the dirt in his helmet, rushed to the coal pile, and madly pointed at the coal pile below, standing alone on top of the coal pile, the scene shifted to the bank of the Wen River.
1:20:3|1:20:22|The woman stopped her movements, slowly raised her head with tears in her eyes, and timidly asked [Gu Zidi] for help. [Gu Zidi] felt a bit reluctant, lowered his head, and continued washing the helmet.
1:20:32|1:20:37|[Gu Zidi] searched on the river and picked up a small stone, gesturing in front of his eyes as he continued speaking.
1:20:50|1:21:24|[Gu Zidi] spoke very restrainedly, but the woman in front of him still blushed, tears sliding down her face. With gentle music playing, the two walked along the winding Wen River in the dense forest. After an unknown amount of time, they arrived at the Martyrs' Monument Forest, where nameless tombstones filled the field. [Gu Zidi] stopped in front of each tombstone, bending over to carefully examine them, his hat almost touching the tombstones.
1:21:25|1:21:31|On the tombstone, in black ink, the brushstrokes of the calligraphy read "Nameless History" in a neat and orderly manner.
1:21:31|1:21:44|The two men solemnly placed their helmets on top of the tombstone, with [Gu Zidi] carefully examining the words on the tombstone step by step. The woman behind him whispered:
1:21:56|1:22:9|[Gu Zidi] slowly straightened up, looking at the forest of steles, almost choking with tears in his voice. His lips trembled, he sniffed and continued, "
1:22:13|1:22:26|[Gu Zidi] furrowed his brows tightly, looking at the stone tablets in pain, and walked forward slowly. The woman also silently packed up her belongings and followed [Gu Zidi] as they left together.
1:22:26|1:23:1|The camera slowly rises, showing two people walking in front and behind, with a vast forest of martyrs' monuments in the distance. A bus drives slowly across the Wenhe Bridge, with lush green mountains behind the bridge and the gentle flow of the Wen River below. The scene follows the vehicle onto a country road, where the bus weaves through cornfields as a gentle breeze blows, causing the crops' leaves to sway lightly.
1:23:2|1:23:11|The rain soaked the fields, and the refreshing scent of the soil penetrated the heart. The countryside after the war was filled with tranquility and quietness.
1:23:13|1:23:44|The scene shifts to outside the border defense post, where a group of soldiers are patrolling with military dogs, walking through muddy terrain. A military vehicle drives out from the post and stops at the gate. [Zhao Erdou] gets off the vehicle and anxiously asks the two soldiers on guard duty outside the gate. [Zhao Erdou] quickly looks to the side, and [Gu Zidi] stands up and says:
1:24:12|1:24:20|[Zhao Erdou] looked at the woman on the side of the road and quietly asked [Gu Zidi],
1:24:57|1:25:14|The scene shifts to the early morning of the next day in the border hospital. [Sun Guiqin] is sleeping on the hospital bed with an IV drip. After confirming that [Sun Guiqin] is sleeping peacefully, [Gu Zidi] gently closes the door and walks over to sit down next to [Zhao Erdou], looking relieved.
1:25:15|1:25:30|This is the hospital corridor, with the cold light shining on the white walls. Several patients are resting wearily in the corridor, while a nurse is mopping the floor. [Gu Zidi] looks at the somewhat tired [Zhao Erdou] and asks softly:
1:25:44|1:26:2|[Gu Zidi] looked at the lunchbox wrapped in a military cap in [Zhao Erdou]'s arms, he smiled, [Zhao Erdou] pursed his lips and said:
1:26:6|1:26:12|[Zhao Erdou] sighed awkwardly while holding the lunchbox.
1:28:8|1:28:48|The nurse taking care of [Sun Guiqin] walked out of the hospital. [Zhao Erdou] turned and asked her. When [Zhao Erdou] turned back, [Gu Zidi] took a deep breath and then said to him. [Gu Zidi] turned to [Zhao Erdou], he leaned on the corridor chair close to [Zhao Erdou] and whispered. [Zhao Erdou] looked at [Gu Zidi] with a sense of realization and asked him:
1:29:7|1:29:14|[Gu Zidi] leaned close to [Zhao Erdou] and asked, "Smile for me, [Zhao Erdou]."
1:29:21|1:29:38|Watching [Zhao Erdou] feeling a bit flustered, [Gu Zidi] started teasing him, nudging [Zhao Erdou] with his elbow. [Zhao Erdou] also awkwardly nudged him back.
1:29:57|1:30:12|Time flies, and winter has arrived. [Gu Zidi] is riding his bicycle, carrying vegetables towards the border defense post. He weaves through the soldiers playing in the snow, and everyone at the post seems particularly happy.
1:31:6|1:31:14|Two cadres, one asking questions and the other taking notes, they don't quite believe in [Gu Zidi].
1:32:38|1:33:16|[Gu Zidi] threw the chair and [Zhao Erdou] outside the door stopped the guards who wanted to come in. [Zhao Erdou] sent away two cadres, who left in frustration. [Gu Zidi], wearing a military coat, walked out of the office slowly and desolately. [Zhao Erdou] walked over, put his hand on [Gu Zidi]'s shoulder, and comforted him.
1:33:24|1:33:27|[Gu Zidi] shook his head and left.
1:33:31|1:34:14|The cold winter has passed, and now it is the days of autumn breeze swaying. [Gu Zidi] strides towards a watchtower, with lush mountains in front of the tower and guards on the tower top alerting against mountain fires. [Gu Zidi] carefully climbs the wooden ladder, and the guard sticks his head out and says to him. As he speaks, [Gu Zidi] has already reached the top of the watchtower. He turns around and looks around, with clear mountain peaks, birds singing, and hills undulating like waves.
1:34:15|1:34:34|[Gu Zidi] leaned on the fence, reaching out to embrace the beautiful scenery, couldn't help but exclaim: [Sun Guiqin]'s voice suddenly came, but [Gu Zidi] didn't hear [Sun Guiqin]'s shout, he was still immersed in the beautiful scenery.
1:34:50|1:35:5|[Sun Guiqin] couldn't catch her breath and shouted excitedly, [Gu Zidi] stood still, leaning on the railing on the watchtower, as if frozen, the two of them looked at each other like this, neither wanting to interrupt the other's excitement.
1:35:5|1:35:11|After a while, [Gu Zidi] finally asked while climbing down the ladder:
1:35:20|1:35:25|[Gu Zidi] went halfway down and leaned on the ladder, crying.
1:35:32|1:35:39|His hand supporting the ladder was trembling uncontrollably, while [Sun Guiqin] below was anxiously waiting. The camera then switched to...
1:35:39|1:35:47|The scene cuts to outside the Martyrs Cemetery, where [Zhao Erdou] leads [Gu Zidi] and [Sun Guiqin] walking briskly inside.
1:36:46|1:37:2|A group of people walked up the steps while talking. At the end of the steps, a middle-aged man with his left arm severed was shouting excitedly. [Gu Zidi] squinted his eyes and scrutinized the person in front of him but still couldn't recognize him, so he asked him:
1:37:12|1:37:20|[Gu Zidi] recognized him and laughed, scolding him.
1:37:23|1:37:36|Watching the excited [Xiao Liangzi], [Gu Zidi] approached him, clutching his empty sleeve without saying a word. Then, several people arrived at the tombstone of [Liu Zeshui].
1:38:24|1:38:33|[Gu Zidi] sat in front of the tombstone and lit a cigarette. He flicked the match and took a deep breath, then said to [Xiao Liangzi]:
1:39:2|1:39:25|[Xiao Liangzi] leaned in to [Gu Zidi]'s ear and whispered, [Gu Zidi] looked incredulous, turned his head to stare at [Xiao Liangzi], tilted his head back and said, [Gu Zidi] still couldn't believe it. [Xiao Liangzi] sighed and revealed the truth of that year.
1:40:2|1:40:8|[Gu Zidi] flicked his cigarette butt, the medals on his chest jingling. He suddenly stood up and grabbed [Xiao Liangzi]'s collar, saying:
1:41:9|1:41:20|[Gu Zidi] was furious, picked up a bottle of white wine and was about to smash it against the tombstone, but was stopped by [Xiao Liangzi].
1:41:40|1:41:55|Zhao Erdou squeezed between the two, arguing loudly to separate them. He turned to [Gu Zidi] and said, "After finishing, he looked at [Gu Zidi] for a while, then turned to [Xiao Liangzi] and said to him:"
1:42:5|1:42:14|[Xiao Liangzi], panting heavily, glared at [Gu Zidi] and sat in front of the tombstone, bursting into tears.
1:42:22|1:42:54|After finishing speaking, he took the bottle of wine from [Gu Zidi] and placed it steadily in front of the tombstone. Then, Zhao Erdou walked to [Sun Guiqin] and gently embraced and comforted her. Gu Zidi, who had calmed down, also slowly walked to the front of the tombstone and sat down. He looked at the cold tombstone, as if he saw Captain [Liu Zeshui], tears rolling down his face. He cleared his throat, swallowed, and looked at the epitaph on the tombstone, softly saying:
1:43:25|1:43:41|Upon hearing this, [Sun Guiqin] beside him was also in tears. Taking advantage of [Gu Zidi]'s memories, the scene shifted back to before the outbreak of the Battle of Wenhe River.
1:44:19|1:44:54|The scene shifts to the Wenhe coal mine, where [Gu Zidi] is walking among the coal piles with luggage and digging equipment on his back. His steps are steady, his gaze determined. [Gu Zidi] casually places the equipment and luggage on the coal piles covered with dried leaves. He ties his legs with a band, lights a cigarette, exhaling smoke that lingers on his face. [Gu Zidi] lies on a canvas tarp, absentmindedly inhaling and exhaling smoke.
1:44:54|1:45:18|Behind him, there was a mountain-like pile of coal and working workers. [Gu Zidi] carried a shovel and a pickaxe, walked through the crowd of workers towards the coal mountain. The workers at the mine just glanced at him without stopping him. [Gu Zidi] leaned on the shovel and pickaxe, climbed halfway up the coal mountain, steadied himself, spat into his palms twice, and swung the pickaxe.
1:45:18|1:45:20|Smashed onto the coal mountain.
1:45:20|1:45:31|However, every hole he dug was quickly filled with new coal rolling down from above.
1:45:40|1:45:48|[Gu Zidi] kept working without looking back, responding to the questions from the workers under the coal mountain. A worker climbed up the mountain and held the shovel, saying:
1:46:3|1:46:38|The worker fought with him for the shovel, [Gu Zidi] pushed him down and fiercely beat him with the shovel. The worker rolled down the coal mountain in embarrassment, shouting as he ran, but [Gu Zidi] ignored him, continuing to swing the pickaxe and strike the coal mountain. As time passed day by day, [Gu Zidi] was covered in coal dust from head to toe.
1:46:38|1:46:46|His rough and dirty hands were stuffing steamed buns into his mouth, it was another snowy winter.
1:47:23|1:47:38|Military cadres and the mine manager are persuading [Gu Zidi] together, with the workers watching on the side. [Gu Zidi] puts on his clothes and picks up his tools as he walks, while the mine manager says somewhat pitifully:
1:47:52|1:47:58|The military cadres left, and the workers also began to disperse to prepare for work.
1:48:3|1:48:6|The scene cuts to [Gu Zidi], who is still digging.
1:48:6|1:48:11|Coal Mountain. On the other side, [Sun Guiqin] arrived at the mine.
1:48:11|1:48:30|Accompanied by a worker, [she] arrived at the place where [Gu Zidi] usually lived. As they walked and talked, they reached the doorway of the room. The worker opened the door.
1:48:30|1:48:38|[Sun Guiqin] stared at the furnishings in the room and slowly walked in. A worker asked [her]:
1:48:41|1:48:48|The room was dimly lit, with only the messy beds and tables, and five neatly hung steel helmets at the head of the bed.
1:49:27|1:49:53|After a simple and clean [Gu Zidi] squatted down to light the paper money. [Sun Guiqin] carefully opened the notification letter from the military region to the Wenhe County military sub-district. [Gu Zidi] turned to look at her, and she slowly spoke:
1:50:55|1:51:23|[Sun Guiqin] finished reading the letter, put it down, looked at [Gu Zidi], the winter wind howled past the two of them. [Gu Zidi] hoarsely said, "Tears once again streaked across [Gu Zidi]'s face, leaving clear tear marks."
1:51:27|1:51:57|Accompanied by the desolate flute sound, the scene once again returns to the memories of [Gu Zidi], in the midst of the battlefield's mountains of corpses and seas of blood. [Gu Zidi] drags each sacrificed soldier of the Ninth Company to the old kiln countless times, slipping on the fresh blood on the ground and getting up countless times, carrying the bodies. Inside the kiln, [Wang Jincun] painstakingly records the deeds of the Ninth Company.
1:52:24|1:53:0|[Gu Zidi] dragged the body of the last soldier into the cave. He looked at the bodies of the soldiers from the Ninth Company filling the cramped cave, tears welling up in his eyes. He glanced at [Wang Jincun], who had bloodstains and dirt on his hands, slowly closing his notebook. [Gu Zidi] carried two bags of explosives and placed them on the roof of the cave. In the distance, the sound of enemy tank tracks rolling could be heard, followed by a dense mass of enemy soldiers.
1:53:0|1:53:13|[Gu Zidi] walked back to the cave with the fuse in hand. Inside the cave, [Wang Jincun] was already unable to move, sitting next to a corpse. [Gu Zidi] walked over, squatted down next to him, and said:
1:53:22|1:53:52|[Gu Zidi] nodded, handed the fuse to [Wang Jincun], who weakly nodded. [Gu Zidi] stood up, holding the shell ready to leave. Tears streamed down [Wang Jincun]'s blood-stained face, [Gu Zidi] looked at him, tears welling up in his eyes. Choking back sobs, he couldn't speak.
1:53:52|1:54:32|[Gu Zidi] walked up to [Wang Jincun], gently rubbing his hair. He had hoped to witness [Wang Jincun]'s transformation, but never expected to experience his life and death. With his head lowered, [Gu Zidi] looked at [Wang Jincun] and choked out, "..." Then he turned and left the cave. Holding the last shell, [Gu Zidi] walked to the back of the small mountain cannon. Enemy tanks and soldiers were quickly advancing towards the position. [Gu Zidi] loaded the shell into the barrel and adjusted the firing angle.
1:54:32|1:54:41|The enemy is getting closer and closer, while [Gu Zidi] adjusts the angle of his hand calmly.
1:54:43|1:54:47|In the cave, [Wang Jincun] pulled the fuse and ignited the explosive package.
