0:0:44|0:0:50|Suddenly, a rapid phone ringing is heard. [Xu Changchun] is busy organizing newspapers and the worker outside the door shouts to him.
0:2:30|0:2:38|The parents' argument escalated, and the daughter couldn't bear it anymore, so she stormed out. The father stood outside the door with a guilty look on his face, sighed softly at his daughter.
0:2:56|0:3:12|In winter, thick snow covers the ground. [Xu Changchun] gets into a van and leaves home, where the house is in a mess with broken cups and clothes scattered all over the floor. His wife sits by the window, watching outside with tears in her eyes, filled with unwillingness, doubt, and grievance.
0:3:12|0:3:21|Xu Changchun thought of something sad, held it in his chest, turned around and put his hand on his forehead. His daughter walked slowly from outside the door and called out tentatively.
0:4:33|0:4:41|[Xu Changchun] came to the film reel station with the 300 yuan he had advanced from the factory. He looked at the neatly arranged film reels of the same size, feeling a bit dazzled.
0:4:41|0:4:55|Finally, he stopped in front of a shelf and took away the films one by one. The startled cashier didn't have time to react, only to see [Xu Changchun] taking out 200 yuan. Then, he went to the supermarket and put whatever he saw into the shopping cart.
0:4:55|0:5:3|He cleared the instant noodles from the shelves, then grabbed a handful of rock sugar, digging out the last one hundred yuan that had been advanced.
0:5:3|0:5:8|The scene changes, and an empty van comes out.
0:5:16|0:5:21|Xu Changchun and his companions loaded the things in front of them onto the car one by one.
0:5:38|0:5:44|Everyone got on the car one by one, in high spirits. The car started slowly and drove forward in a snowy field.
0:6:4|0:6:13|The car slowly drove towards the mountains, the heavy snow covering the land like a blanket, creating a clean and pure scene. In the distance, the melodious chirping of birds could be heard from time to time.
0:6:13|0:6:28|The car drove on the mountain road, turning around bends and crossing small hills. The heavy snow covered the mountains and the road, causing the car to move slowly, leaving only tire tracks spreading in the mountains. Before long, the car had also disappeared into the distance.
0:6:29|0:6:33|The sound of the engine starting could be heard coming from the top of the mountain.
0:6:33|0:6:39|The woman wrapped herself tightly, then took off her helmet the next second and looked towards the direction the car was heading.
0:6:39|0:6:42|The daughter of [Xu Changchun], Qingqing.
0:6:42|0:6:53|She rode a motorcycle following her father to the countryside. After a moment of contemplation, as if making up her mind, she put her helmet back on, twisted the throttle, and continued to ride forward under the gloomy sky.
0:6:53|0:7:12|The heavy snow covered the road layer by layer, the wind howled in the ears, even wearing thick cotton coats, it was still hard to resist the cold. The ground was wet and slippery, the speed of the motorcycle was not fast, but with every turn, the motorcycle still swayed. Following the tire tracks left behind lightly, Xu Changchun and Xu Qingqing searched all the way, the surroundings unusually quiet.
0:7:12|0:7:19|Only the roaring sound of a motorcycle engine can be heard as [Xu Changchun] and pedestrians continue to move forward without any intention of stopping.
0:7:19|0:7:25|On the snow-covered mountain road, only a van could be seen, swaying and moving slowly.
0:7:25|0:7:29|[徐青青] behind him was also a star that dared not stop, following closely.
0:7:29|0:7:34|Only a sound of urgent brakes was heard, leading to a village at the foot of the mountain for her.
0:7:34|0:7:38|[Xu Qingqing] stood on the mountain, overlooking the village below.
0:7:38|0:7:45|She then opened the helmet, sighed, knowing that she was getting closer and closer to the truth.
0:8:28|0:8:33|On the other side, [Xu Qingqing] rode a motorcycle to Xingfatun.
0:8:37|0:8:43|Speak up, [Xu Changchun] left the village committee of Xingfatun, and the children peeking at the door looked curious.
0:8:43|0:8:49|Shortly after, a man walked out from the village committee, pondered for a moment, and then walked in another direction.
0:8:49|0:9:1|After leaving the village committee, [Xu Changchun] and others immediately got busy. One person was seen slowly climbing up a tree while holding it, and another person climbed up a ladder onto the basketball hoop, placing the small TV squarely on the basketball frame.
0:9:1|0:9:6|The scene shifts, the man ties the rope of the wooden cloth to the wood, attracting many children.
0:9:11|0:9:21|[Xu Changchun] lays out a large fistful of thread on the ground, while his companion presses the wooden cloth line under a stone and pulls it tight, eyes fixed on the direction of the wooden cloth, making final adjustments.
0:12:33|0:12:43|Upon hearing the distant sounds of slaughter, [Xu Changchun] quickly opened the car door and hurried towards the comrade operating the machine gun.
0:15:23|0:15:38|Xu Qingqing rode the motorcycle leisurely back and forth.
0:16:5|0:16:10|The argument left the villagers who were about to leave stunned in place, and [Xu Qingqing] felt it too.
0:16:10|0:16:11|Xu Changchun said.
0:16:27|0:16:29|Upon hearing this, [Xu Changchun] immediately widened his eyes.
0:18:24|0:18:29|His spirit influences one generation, two generations, three generations.
0:18:44|0:18:48|More than thirty years later, China has undergone tremendous changes.
0:20:23|0:20:33|With a loud whistle, the sound of a train horn came from afar. [Xu Changchun] stood tall, raising his right thumb slowly and placing it next to his ear.
0:20:33|0:20:38|This shot is a tribute to the trust of the villagers and to the old soldiers who have served the people.
0:20:38|0:20:43|The village chief in the distance was also moved by the scene, he picked up the microphone and shouted to the whole village.
0:21:59|0:22:7|Night falls, and the movie begins to play. At first, only a few people came, but later it became a dozen, then dozens.
0:22:7|0:22:11|The group sat together in silence, only the sound of the film reel spinning rapidly could be heard. 
0:22:59|0:23:10|The scene shifts to indoors, with [Xu Qingqing] pacing back and forth in the room, clutching her fist to her chest, her expression grim. She keeps glancing towards the door, as if waiting for something.
0:23:10|0:23:12|The door suddenly opened, and [Xu Qingqing] came back gently.
0:24:46|0:24:57|As the music slowly fades away, the movie is coming to an end. On this cold winter night, everyone is immersed in the film, reluctant to leave, and some can even hear the quiet sobs of those who are moved.
0:27:12|0:27:26|The winding path was dark and yellow, with [Xu Changchun] and [Xu Qingqing] walking towards the rising sun, heading to their next destination.
0:27:26|0:27:36|Early the next morning, [Xu Qingqing] was busy in the kitchen, preparing a delicious meal with a fragrant aroma filling the air. Soon after, she shouted loudly.
0:27:36|0:27:39|Xingxing quickly stops in the Beijing kitchen, and her mother has just finished stir-frying the vegetables.
0:27:48|0:27:51|[Xu Changchun] couldn't help but lower his head and sniff hard.
0:31:6|0:31:11|You, please, please, the wife sternly stopped, and the father's face became increasingly ugly.
0:31:26|0:31:31|[Xu Qingqing] looked puzzled, [Xu Changchun] suddenly got up and left, while his mother quietly scolded him.
0:32:29|0:32:38|In the blink of an eye, the bus had already arrived at the foot of the hill.
0:32:38|0:32:50|The van drove further and further away, with [Xu Qingqing] braving the cold wind, lying on the thick snow without moving. Later, [Xu Qingqing] shouted towards the van, but due to the distance, [Xu Changchun] inside the car couldn't hear at all.
0:32:52|0:32:55|He climbed up a hill with all his strength.
0:32:55|0:32:58|[Xu Changchun]'s van was driving down the hill.
0:32:58|0:33:1|Looking at the van below the slope, [Xu Qingqing] waved her arms.
0:33:3|0:33:6|Jin Qing vigorously waved her arms, hoping Xu Changchun below the hill could see.
0:33:9|0:33:11|[Xu Changchun] heard the voice of [Xu Qingqing] and poked his head out.
0:33:17|0:33:23|Looking at Xu Qingqing on the hillside, Xu Changchun reached out of the window and waved in response.
0:33:23|0:33:29|Xu Qingqing on the hillside watched her father leaving on the bus, quietly sobbing.
0:33:29|0:33:35|At this moment, she only felt endless guilt towards [Xu Changchun].
0:33:46|0:33:50|The scene shifts, and the van finally slows down at the side of the road.
0:33:50|0:33:55|The sign by the roadside reads, "Go to the restaurant, Yuzi goes up the mountain."
0:33:55|0:33:59|[Xu Changchun] and his comrades got off the car together and took out the projection equipment from the car.
0:33:59|0:34:4|To protect the equipment, they carried all these packages on their shoulders.
0:34:4|0:34:8|The heavy equipment hung on the body, involuntarily emitting sighs.
0:34:36|0:34:40|In the desolate mountains, only Xu Changchun and a few others were seen moving slowly.
0:35:31|0:35:39|Liu Shijun stood still in shock upon hearing this, then with an even more alarmed expression, he walked towards [Xu Changchun].
0:35:39|0:35:47|He picked up the box in Xu Changchun's hand, with other equipment hidden on his shoulder, and continued to walk forward without looking back.
0:35:47|0:36:3|The cold winter wind is piercing, with a desolate and barren landscape. Thick snow covers the plain, and [Xu Changchun] and three others are wearing military coats, carrying various projection equipment on their shoulders and in their hands. The snow has covered the original grassland, and with one step, they sink directly into the snow up to their calves.
0:36:3|0:36:16|[Xu Changchun] and his companions moved forward slowly step by step in the thick snow. Even when they fell, they would try to get up. They helped each other, brushed off the snow on their bodies, and continued on their way.
0:36:16|0:36:21|The sun slowly rises as Xu Changchun and Xu Qingqing, carrying heavy equipment, have been walking for who knows how long.
0:36:21|0:36:24|The continuous walking made several people sweat profusely.
0:36:24|0:36:28|They carried big and small bags, climbing over small hills one after another.
0:36:28|0:36:45|The speed may not be fast, but the footsteps are continuous. On another hill, [Xu Changchun] stops and looks into the distance. The long walk has left him somewhat exhausted, with the snow getting deeper and now covering his knees, making every step a significant test of his physical endurance.
0:37:12|0:37:18|The old grandfather in the village stood on a watchtower made of tree branches, occasionally looking into the distance with a telescope. 
0:37:37|0:37:44|In the golden hour, the gentle sunlight slanted down, and [Xu Changchun] and his group hurriedly walked through the courtyard carrying the projection equipment.
0:38:5|0:38:14|The sun silently set behind the mountains, and [Xu Changchun] and his companions sat around the campfire.
0:38:44|0:38:49|Everyone's faces were beaming with smiles, and [Xu Changchun] and the others started drinking the ginseng soup heartily.
0:38:49|0:38:52|Before you know it, Grandpa Xu Changchun entered the room with a sumptuous meal.
0:39:34|0:39:44|The warmth of the villagers warmed [Xu Changchun], and his damp shoes also became warm in the cozy room.
0:39:44|0:39:51|Night fell, with only Grandpa and his grandson in the courtyard, but [Xu Changchun] still spared no effort to set up the bathing facilities.
0:39:51|0:39:55|On a particularly cold night, Grandpa Xu Changchun stared intently at Mu Bu, urging him on.
0:40:43|0:40:55|Suddenly, a strong wind blew, causing the tree to sway. Xu Changchun quickly ran towards the tree and climbed up in three steps, grabbing the rope above Xu Qingqing.
0:40:55|0:40:57|[Xu Changchun] shouted in concern.
0:41:6|0:41:7|At this moment, Grandpa said worriedly.
0:43:3|0:43:6|Grandpa saw his grandson laughing happily and bumped him with his arm.
0:43:51|0:43:55|Liu Shijun ran towards [Xu Changchun], but [Xu Changchun] insisted on grabbing the rope himself.
0:43:55|0:43:59|Liu Shijun had to do his best to grab the edge of the curtain to relieve the pressure on [Xu Changchun].
0:43:59|0:44:2|The old man looked at the two people in front of him, tears welling up in his eyes.
0:44:56|0:44:58|[Xu Changchun] quickly turned back to the sea.
0:45:13|0:45:18|Dongye couldn't help but reach out his hand, and a few people used flashlights to see the items in the box.
0:47:51|0:47:57|On the way down the mountain, the east had already turned white.
0:48:8|0:48:21|In the printing factory, [Xu Changchun] hung up the phone decisively with a firm tone, and sat on a chair with a worried look on his face.
0:49:55|0:49:57|Zhou Yumei had just left when the phone rang again.
0:50:30|0:50:39|[Xu Changchun] happily hung up the phone, a smile filling the wrinkles on his face. He slowly got up, pacing back and forth in the office, joyfully preparing for his brother's visit.
0:50:39|0:50:48|Suddenly, as if his right leg was hit, the next second he showed pain, [Xu Changchun] covered his right leg and slowly ran towards the sofa behind him.
0:50:48|0:50:52|After sitting down slowly, [Xu Changchun] gently tapped his right leg with his right hand to relieve the pain.
0:51:32|0:51:35|The wife wrapped the medicine package and protected it on [Xu Changchun]'s leg.
0:52:50|0:52:52|His wife interrupted him, creating a somewhat awkward atmosphere.
0:53:1|0:53:6|After a brief exchange of pleasantries, the wife saw off Zhou Yumei, with [Xu Changchun] silently following behind.
0:54:10|0:54:13|[Xu Changchun] pushed away his wife's hand and slowly got up.
0:54:13|0:54:15|His wife quickly supported him and then spoke.
0:54:37|0:54:57|[Xu Changchun] hesitated to speak, just sighed, the scene shifted, the train with a huge roar, the wind rushing through the driving formation, carriages passing through two rows of trees and towns, across lakes and forests. In a certain carriage, a man in a police uniform, looking refreshed, gazed ahead, his eyes occasionally vacant.
0:55:36|0:55:43|[Xu Changchun] and his comrades trudged through the heavy snow, crossed the suspension bridge, faced continuous challenges along the way, but they overcame them all to screen a movie for the villagers.
0:55:54|0:56:12|With the sound of the train whistle, carriages one after another rushed towards the platform in the cold wind. The deafening sound of the machines enveloped the forest, and the wind blowing from under the train made the trees swirl. Late at night, walking alone on the street, suddenly hearing the distant honking of a car.
0:56:12|0:56:17|A van was parked directly in front of the printing factory owned by [Xu Changchun].
0:56:17|0:56:22|Before long, several people got out of the car, it was Xu Changchun and his comrades.
0:56:38|0:56:41|[Xu Changchun] stared straight at [Xu Qingqing] in front of him.
0:56:41|0:56:43|[Xu Qingqing] takes the initiative to speak.
0:56:44|0:56:47|[Xu Qingqing] pouted like a child who had done something wrong.
0:56:47|0:56:52|[Xu Changchun] had a gentle look in his eyes, with a hint of a smile at the corner of his mouth, slowly walking towards [Xu Qingqing].
0:58:22|0:58:25|A young girl holding a team flag shouted loudly.
0:58:44|0:58:53|The patriotic and affectionate Xu Changchun clearly sees the red and green flag fluttering in the sky.
0:59:32|0:59:41|There is no hypocrisy, no exaggeration, every detail is impeccable honesty and truth.
1:1:5|1:1:13|A military discipline officer brought a brand new computer to the table in front of them. Villagers, children, everyone had happy smiles on their faces.
1:1:13|1:1:16|At this moment, a truck loaded with goods woke up at the school gate.
1:1:21|1:1:24|Li, a villager, gets out of the car and walks straight into the school.
1:2:46|1:2:53|Xu Changchun sets up the projection equipment, and all the villagers in the village sit neatly on the snow-covered playground.
1:2:53|1:2:58|In the spacious playground, only the sound of the videotape and the echo of the movie can be heard.
1:2:58|1:3:2|At this moment, the movie "Going to School Behind Dad" appears on the screen.
1:3:3|1:3:8|The movie slowly begins, occasionally hearing the sparse discussions of villagers.
1:3:8|1:3:15|The elementary school students sitting in the front rows, dressed in neat school uniforms and red scarves, eagerly watched the movie playing in front of them.
1:4:3|1:4:9|The little boy in the movie looked at his father lying on the ground, feeling guilty, he opened his mouth but couldn't make a sound.
1:4:20|1:4:25|Sad music starts playing as the touching scene unfolds, moving the hearts of the villagers.
1:4:25|1:4:33|Everyone had furrowed brows and tears in their eyes, even the young men in the village were moved by the words of the little boy.
1:4:33|1:4:39|A primary school student was completely immersed in the emotions of the movie, their swollen eyes fixed on the screen without blinking.
1:4:39|1:4:48|Suddenly, a few tears rolled down her cheeks. She quickly reached out to wipe them away, leaving traces of tears on her innocent and tender face.
1:4:48|1:4:53|The scene shifts to a late night, with [Zhou Yunmei] swaying back and forth as she rides a bicycle.
1:4:53|1:5:1|She gasped for breath, her eyes struggling to stay open as she looked at the road ahead. Along the way, she kept coughing incessantly, even making a retching sound.
1:5:1|1:5:4|The night was extremely painful, on a winter night, the road was dark and slippery.
1:5:5|1:5:10|[Zhou Yumei] rode her bicycle along the road and drowsily entered [Xu Changchun]'s residential area.
1:5:10|1:5:16|One moment of inattention, [Zhou Yumei] fell off her bicycle and tumbled to the side of the road.
1:5:16|1:5:26|Rising slowly, she looked bewildered.
1:5:52|1:5:57|[Zhou Yumei] unzipped her jacket and took out a neatly folded piece of paper from the pocket inside.
1:5:57|1:6:0|She unfolded the paper with a big smile on her face, looking a bit dazed.
1:6:0|1:6:3|At this moment, [Xu Changchun]'s wife walked over with a glass of water.
1:6:28|1:6:34|Zhou Yumei, in a drunken state, just tried to get up when the next second she fell backwards.
1:6:34|1:6:38|She leaned back on the sofa, with her eyes closed but a smile on her face.
1:6:58|1:7:8|The scene shifts to a restaurant where [Xu Changchun] and his group are sitting together. He is pouring drinks for everyone one by one, while the others sit in silence with solemn expressions.
1:7:8|1:7:15|Everyone was deep in thought, reluctant to speak first, looking at each other with confusion.
1:7:37|1:7:40|The atmosphere became even more tense, and [Xu Changchun] spoke again.
1:7:48|1:7:52|The group raised their glasses, clinked them together, and then drank them all in one go.
1:7:52|1:7:58|[Xu Changchun] was the first to finish his drink, then he picked up the bottle and poured himself another glass, saying.
1:8:20|1:8:25|[Xu Changchun] looked at the embarrassed Zhu Guangxu, reached out his hand to signal him not to say more, and sighed.
1:8:45|1:9:0|The atmosphere was so tense that everyone looked at each other, not knowing how to speak. They could only eat their food forcefully, occasionally hearing some belching sounds. [Xu Changchun] looked at Zhu Guangxu in front of him, wanting to speak but held back.
1:10:52|1:10:56|[Xu Changchun] turned around, looking angrily at [Xu Qingqing], wanting to speak but hesitating.
1:10:56|1:11:0|Qingqing stared with wide eyes, pursed her lips, and looked at [Xu Changchun] confidently.
1:11:0|1:11:4|[Xu Changchun] sighed and walked out of the office.
1:11:4|1:11:9|Dad's temper is getting more and more strange, he seems very repressed.
1:13:55|1:14:13|The scene shifts to a snowy mountain road, where only the sound of a car driving can be heard quietly. Riding a motorcycle gently at the front, [Xu Changchun] is followed closely by two vans, with Zhou Yumei tightly holding onto Liu Shijun inside one of the vans, happily looking at the scenery outside the window, eagerly anticipating this journey.
1:14:13|1:14:19|In another car, [Xu Changchun] leaned on his wife's shoulder with his eyes closed, and his wife nudged him with her head and asked.
1:14:35|1:14:40|[Xu Changchun] sat up, looking at his wife in astonishment as she spoke again.
1:14:52|1:14:56|Saying that, [Xu Changchun] excitedly saluted his wife.
1:14:56|1:15:2|His wife was somewhat surprised by Xu Changchun's actions, and then she reached out and held Xu Changchun's hand.
1:15:2|1:15:7|At this moment, all emotions surged up, hot tears rolling in the eyes.
1:15:7|1:15:15|He tightly held Xu Changchun's hand, with the winter sun shining down warmly, the flat snowfield resembling layers of blue sand under the bright sun.
1:15:15|1:15:20|The team arrived at a fork in the road in the mountains, slowed down, and continued in different directions.
1:15:20|1:15:27|On New Year's Eve, the village was particularly lively, with every household hanging up large lanterns and pasting couplets.
1:15:27|1:15:33|The sound of firecrackers was continuous, everyone covered their ears, and both adults and children had happy smiles on their faces.
1:15:45|1:15:49|The film starts with four big characters on the screen: "Don't leave until you see me."
1:15:49|1:15:57|Both adults and children were staring intently at the movie playing in front of them, all completely engrossed and silent.
1:15:57|1:16:1|Everyone dared not make a sound, waiting quietly for the movie to begin.
1:16:1|1:16:6|The next moment, the movie officially begins, and everyone becomes excited, whispering to each other.
1:16:7|1:16:12|The crowd inside the fence was packed tightly, one person next to another, with almost no room to move.
1:16:12|1:16:25|Outside the fence, it was so crowded that people were packed tightly, with three layers inside and three layers outside.
1:17:27|1:17:33|At night, the snow-covered mountains were deserted, with only the gentle sound of a motorcycle echoing through the valley.
1:18:30|1:18:34|The movie started slowly, and the villagers gradually quieted down.
1:19:6|1:19:11|Over here, [Xu Qingqing] is riding a motorcycle non-stop back.
1:19:11|1:19:15|Tonight, the village is particularly lively, with the sound of movies and fireworks filling the air.
1:19:25|1:19:33|The videotape was playing with a crackling sound. [Xu Changchun] anxiously opened it to check, as it was about to finish playing, but [Xu Qingqing] had not arrived yet.
1:19:33|1:19:41|On the other side, the cold in the mountains was like a green arrow flying in the night sky, making a sharp sound. [Xu Qingqing] struggled to move forward against the wind.
1:19:41|1:19:43|Over here, [Xu Changchun] couldn't wait any longer.
1:19:50|1:20:4|With just one turn, the road was too slippery, causing the car to slide and fall down gently.
1:20:4|1:20:12|Due to the cold weather, the motorcycle unexpectedly stalled. [Xu Qingqing] struggled to get up, and tried hard to lift the motorcycle, but couldn't move it no matter how hard she tried.
1:20:12|1:20:24|On the other side, [Xu Changchun] anxiously flashed a flashlight and hurriedly walked out of the village. [Xu Qingqing] exerted all her strength, but the motorcycle remained motionless. She looked into the distance, then glanced at her watch, making a decision in her heart.
1:20:24|1:20:30|She gritted her teeth, then decisively got up and walked quickly towards the village where [Xu Changchun] was located.
1:20:30|1:20:37|Xu Changchun here is carrying a videotape and using a flashlight, hoping to find Xu Qingqing as soon as possible and hand over the videotape to her.
1:21:11|1:21:15|[Xu Changchun] fell to the ground, and [Xu Qingqing] quickly ran over to help him up.
1:22:26|1:22:31|Qingqing hoisted the heavy videotape onto her shoulder and turned to walk forward.
1:22:31|1:22:36|[Xu Changchun] behind her was boasting in the snow, while Jingjing, with tears in her eyes, turned around and shouted.
1:22:42|1:22:46|Qingqing's face was full of tears as she took two steps back and looked back at [Xu Changchun] reluctantly.
1:22:52|1:22:56|Quietly finishing the last sentence, [Xu Qingqing] walked forward without looking back.
1:22:56|1:23:5|The cold was eroding [Xu Changchun], who was standing in the snow. After an unknown period of time, a van broke through the darkness of the mountains and slowly drove towards him, braving the cold wind.
1:23:5|1:23:11|[Xu Changchun]'s legs were already covered in snow, and he tried to move them to keep them warm, while the cold wind made a piercing sound.
1:23:11|1:23:16|The wife and village chief in the van quickly lifted [Xu Changchun] who was blocking the road.
1:23:46|1:23:51|The van slowly drove away, the wind getting stronger. The village chief helped Xu Changchun to quickly tidy up.
1:24:23|1:24:28|The scene shifts to a nursing home in a mountain village, which, though small, is very cozy.
1:24:28|1:24:31|In the middle, there is a hexagonal pavilion for the elderly to rest.
1:24:31|1:24:38|Tonight is very special. In the spacious courtyard, a group of elderly people sit neatly watching the movie, each with a big smile on their face.
1:24:38|1:24:43|They were mostly covered with white hair, their eyes narrowed into a slit, sparkling with the radiant smile of [Xu Qingqing].
1:24:43|1:24:47|That night, [Xu Changchun] miraculously stood up.
1:24:49|1:24:50|He said.
1:24:56|1:25:1|Uncle Liu and the others moved from Huashugou to Hutou Ridge.
1:25:1|1:25:6|Dad, Mom, Uncle Liang, and I arrived at the mountain village nursing home.
1:25:8|1:25:14|In the early morning, the village was particularly lively, with every household setting off firecrackers to celebrate the new year.
1:25:14|1:25:19|Firecrackers popped loudly as beautiful wings unfolded in the sky.
1:25:19|1:25:25|At dusk, heavy snow covered all the trees and grass, and the sunlight scattered down, as if dressing the earth in a thin layer of green.
1:25:26|1:25:33|The strong wind blew wildly, chilling to the bone, the bare trees stood in the cold wind, interacting with branches and leaves.
1:25:33|1:25:36|The scene changes, and the heavy snow blankets the mountains like a thick quilt.
1:25:36|1:25:39|[Xu Changchun] The projection team has started their journey again.
1:25:39|1:25:45|Two days later, six more veterans joined Xu Changchun and Xu Qingqing's team.
1:25:45|1:25:49|A month later, it was rumored that more than a dozen voluntary film projection teams had appeared again.
1:25:51|1:25:58|In another year, who knows how many unexpected things will happen.
