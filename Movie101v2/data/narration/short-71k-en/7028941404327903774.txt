0:1:35|0:1:48|Wearing casual denim clothes, he obviously stood out from the crowd in formal attire. As a special agent intelligence officer, [Bill] had already disguised himself as a security guard. He saw [Mouse] coming in and quietly approached a woman waiting in line for inspection.
0:2:4|0:2:10|At this point, [Bill] had already switched the cards, and [Mouse] teased while holding the card.
0:2:17|0:2:25|As soon as the words fell, [Mouse] fluently inserted the card into the reader, fingers quickly tapping on the keyboard. Soon, the identity information on the card was changed.
0:2:25|0:2:33|Mouse smiled satisfactorily. Then, the leader of the special agents, [Lion King], successfully sneaked in with a new identity card.
0:2:40|0:2:48|[Lion King] looked around cautiously before swiping the card to enter the room, and he greeted the receptionist inside proactively.
0:4:19|0:4:29|In the room, [Ma Wen] stood up and glared fiercely at his assistant who was singing against him.
0:4:50|0:4:54|[Ma Wen] bumped into the other party and walked straight out the door.
0:4:54|0:5:2|The man who stayed in the room stood still and then took out his phone from his pocket and started pressing it.
0:5:24|0:5:28|The scene shifts to the music hall, where the vast venue is packed with people.
0:5:28|0:5:39|[Lion King] sat in front of the piano, ready to play. As the music started, [Lion King]'s fingers began to move along.
0:5:41|0:5:45|Accompanied by the enthusiastic invitation of the host, [Ma Wen] walked onto the stage and waved to the audience.
0:5:45|0:5:50|The crystal ball above the music hall and him on the stage became the highlights of the whole scene.
0:6:18|0:6:21|Suddenly, sparks flew on the stage, and [Ma Wen] looked horrified.
0:6:22|0:6:29|The crystal ball above suddenly plummeted, causing a loud explosion that made the whole audience scream and panic.
0:6:30|0:6:38|Sparks spewed towards the audience, causing a panic as everyone screamed and rushed out.
0:6:39|0:6:46|The scattered ashes on the stage have long been pierced into the underground parking lot.
0:7:1|0:7:9|The off-road vehicle crashed heavily into the pillar, leaving the security guards who witnessed it dumbfounded. They surrounded the entire vehicle with guns raised.
0:7:9|0:7:13|The car door opens, and the security guard looks around but doesn't see anyone.
0:7:16|0:7:22|At this moment, in the dilapidated music hall, [Lion King] and [Volcano] flipped open the piano lid.
0:7:22|0:7:30|Bound [Ma Wen] lay there, at a loss.
0:7:33|0:7:40|[Volcano] grabbed [Ma Wen]'s collar and said. [Ma Wen] was so scared that his eyes widened.
0:7:45|0:7:59|Three people started to escape with [Ma Wen], first taking [Ma Wen] away. [Lion King] picked up a trash can and smashed the security guards, while [Volcano] broke through the glass to suppress the security guards. Then, kicked the gun on the ground to [Lion King].
0:7:59|0:8:7|The two of them cooperated seamlessly to eliminate the threat. At this moment, gunshots were heard behind them, and they hurriedly ran over.
0:8:8|0:8:14|Approaching closer, [Ma Wen] who was shot in the head, collapsed at the corner.
0:8:14|0:8:21|Bill, shot in the knee, leaned against the glass door, while Ma Wen's assistant lay in a pool of blood, holding a gun.
0:8:22|0:8:32|According to [Bill]'s recollection, the two of them ran into the assistant head-on while fleeing. Before they could react, the assistant had already shot and blown up [Ma Wen]. [Bill] ran forward to snatch the gun.
0:8:32|0:8:35|Unexpectedly, in the midst of the struggle, the assistant aimed another shot at his knee.
0:8:35|0:8:43|He then endured the pain, exerted all his strength to push the assistant down to the ground, and then pressed the gun against the other's chest and fired.
0:8:45|0:8:53|[Lion King] supported the limping [Bill] as they ran out, with [Volcano] providing cover. After the mission failed, the five of them escaped the desert by car. Inside the car,
0:8:54|0:9:5|Mouse bandages Bill's wound, causing Bill to grimace in pain. At that moment, on the car TV screen, the chief angrily questions everyone.
0:9:12|0:9:21|The remote-locked vehicle was approached by [Bill], who got out of the car limping and slammed the door shut heavily.
0:9:53|0:10:3|The jokes, light-hearted or serious, cannot diminish the brotherhood that binds everyone together.
0:10:3|0:10:9|The endless desert ahead seems to have no end in sight, just like everyone's future.
0:10:9|0:10:17|With a few gunshots, the four big characters of "Golden Brothers" were displayed on the wall like a brand.
0:10:17|0:10:33|The film officially begins, set 5 years later. In the scene, a refugee camp in Africa, built with white cloth, fills the land. Children's faces are full of innocence, some snuggling in their mother's arms, some playing with their friends.
0:10:33|0:10:40|The doctor in a white coat crosses paths with the volunteers in this tender scene, bringing a sense of security to people.
0:10:50|0:10:57|[Lion King] got off the car, smiled and high-fived the little girl, who then grabbed his hand and ran to the edge of the tent.
0:10:57|0:11:4|Dr. Zhou in the tent is conducting an examination, encouraging the little girl as he slowly helps her up.
0:11:4|0:11:11|The girl was very scared, she looked up at Dr. Zhou, who then smiled and comforted the nervous little girl.
0:11:11|0:11:19|[Lion King] watched as the woman in front of him gradually captivated him, standing still in place, savoring the beauty of this moment.
0:11:20|0:11:27|Dr. Zhou seemed to have noticed something, turned his head, exchanged a smile with Lion King, and then walked out of the tent.
0:11:45|0:11:53|Dr. Zhou took out a bottle of medicine from the box and examined it carefully, suddenly his face changed.
0:11:55|0:12:6|[Lion King] lowered his head and dared not look at Dr. Zhou, then he walked out of the tent and picked up his phone to make a call.
0:12:6|0:12:15|At this moment, [Bill] is accompanied by beautiful women, having a great time.
0:12:53|0:12:59|[Lion King] stood still with a solemn expression, then the two of them came to the lakeside to enjoy a peaceful time.
0:13:16|0:13:21|[Lion King] smiled and took out a necklace from his pocket, gently putting it on Zhou Doctor from behind.
0:13:23|0:13:28|Dr. Zhou turned around, touching the uniquely designed necklace, and [Lion King] smiled awkwardly.
0:13:28|0:13:33|Suddenly, Dr. Zhou pulled out the mini dagger from the necklace.
0:13:36|0:13:45|Looking at [Lion King] with anticipation, Dr. Zhou's eyes were full of smiles. She turned around, lowered her head, and smiled lightly, touching the self-defense necklace around her neck with both hands.
0:14:2|0:14:9|Dr. Zhou turned around and met the fiery gaze of [Lion King]. [Lion King] pursed his lips and remained silent, just looking at her.
0:14:10|0:14:24|Dr. Zhou turned around and scolded [Lion King] with a smile, pushed him away, sat down, then took off her shoes and threw them aside before dipping her bare feet into the lake to splash around. [Lion King] sat down beside her.
0:14:24|0:14:32|Dr. Zhou also leaned against his solid shoulder, and at this moment, ripples appeared on the calm lake surface.
0:14:56|0:15:6|When they arrived in Budapest, Hungary at the agreed time, the four of them saw [Bill] standing in front of a luxury sports car, admiring himself as they neared their destination.
0:15:20|0:15:25|Four people were hiding quietly, but were discovered by [Bill] who turned around, so he quickly ran over.
0:15:49|0:16:5|The waiter led them to the luxurious yacht, where several people were holding Lion King's phone, ready to take photos, when suddenly, the phone rang.
0:17:58|0:18:3|[Bill] opened a bottle of red wine, and everyone cheered and clapped.
0:18:40|0:18:47|In the room, [Bill] is playing a racing game, his cold eyes staring ahead, hands tightly gripping the steering wheel to control the direction.
0:18:48|0:18:56|[Volcano] walked in silently from behind and looked at [Bill], who was completely focused on playing the game. He reached out and pulled down the handle of the racing driver, ending the game.
0:18:56|0:19:2|[Bill] ignored him and continued to play with the steering wheel.
0:19:12|0:19:18|After speaking, [Bill] ignored [Volcano] and walked straight towards the railing. [Volcano] felt something was wrong and followed.
0:19:18|0:19:28|The atmosphere downstairs was lively at this moment,
0:19:33|0:19:53|On the second floor, [Volcano] and [Bill] who were hugging each other suddenly separated. The next day, everyone arrived at an abandoned factory. The rolling shutter slowly rose, and the five upright figures gradually appeared. They walked in with their heads held high.
0:21:9|0:21:18|By the roadside, [Sir Cao] disguised as a maintenance worker is dealing with the excess roadblocks, while [Lai Si]'s assistant opens the door, looking around vigilantly.
0:21:18|0:21:22|He then watched the delivery truck drive away with his own eyes.
0:21:58|0:22:4|On the street, the delivery truck was driving steadily forward, followed closely by a helicopter in the air.
0:22:5|0:22:13|On the other side, [Bill] stepped on the gas pedal and drove at high speed, then found the right moment to turn the steering wheel hard. The car drifted and crashed into a fire hydrant.
0:22:13|0:22:22|Water splashed out recklessly, foam covering the road everywhere. Motorcycles that didn't have time to brake slipped on the foam-covered road.
0:22:22|0:22:27|The foam on the ground is stirred up into the sky, and the children on the roadside laugh and play with the foam.
0:22:40|0:22:52|After encountering a roadblock, Lion King's delivery van, driven by Bill, quickly came up with a solution. The team led by Lion King marked the new route clearly, and the delivery driver immediately followed the new path after this small incident.
0:23:0|0:23:14|The helicopter immediately changed its route to escort the delivery truck. As the delivery truck was about to enter the tunnel, the helicopter above reported the situation to [Lion King].
0:23:48|0:23:59|Due to interference, the delivery van loses its location information after entering the tunnel. The helicopter behind them sends a notification, saying they are preparing to fly to the tunnel exit to wait.
0:23:59|0:24:6|Every member of the Rice team stared at the computer screen intently. Faced with the uncontrollable situation, everyone became visibly nervous.
0:24:14|0:24:23|Everyone waited calmly for the arrival of the delivery truck after receiving the instructions, and [Lion King] never took his eyes off the tracking system.
0:24:58|0:25:3|The plane rapidly descended, forcing the disobedient delivery truck to stop in the middle of the road.
0:25:3|0:25:9|The commander and the pilot jumped out of the plane, running towards the delivery truck with guns in hand.
0:25:9|0:25:12|The people in the car looked at the two approaching figures in terror.
0:25:32|0:25:42|The scene cuts to the driver's memory, where a strangely dressed man approaches the delivery man who is eating a hamburger. He holds a stack of money and asks the delivery man if he wants to make some extra money.
0:25:50|0:25:54|The man told him the agreed time and place, then said thank you in Japanese and left. The delivery man behind him looked surprised.
0:25:54|0:26:0|The commander turned around in a rage, his fierce eyes seemed to devour people.
0:26:0|0:26:11|15 minutes ago, [Lulu] followed the plan and threw an iron nail in the middle of the road, causing the driver's tire to be punctured, as reported by Bill.
0:26:25|0:26:31|Lai's delivery van is about to enter the tunnel, followed closely by a truck with graffiti driven by [Lion King], a masked bandit.
0:26:33|0:26:40|Lion King's car had just entered the tunnel when Sir Cao immediately blocked the entrance with a maintenance vehicle.
0:26:40|0:26:48|He placed the roadblock on the side and waved to the car behind. Inside the tunnel, the carriage of [Lion King] was pulled up by someone.
0:26:48|0:26:55|Wearing a mask, [Volcano] squatted inside, then he pried open the carriage and placed a smoke bomb in the ventilation opening of the delivery van.
0:26:56|0:27:2|Smoke quickly filled the car through the air conditioning, causing Rice's henchman to pass out on the steering wheel.
0:27:2|0:27:11|Immediately, the truck blocked the delivery van from behind, [Volcano] jumped out of the truck door, entered the smoke-filled delivery van, and removed the tracker.
0:27:11|0:27:29|[Lion King] pressed the remote control, and the graffiti truck's compartment moved backward. Then [Volcano] threw a tracker, and [Lion King] gave a thumbs up to [Volcano].
0:27:33|0:27:40|[Lion King] drove away in the truck, leaving [Volcano] to follow. Only Lai Si's men were left lying on the side of the road, unconscious.
0:27:46|0:28:2|Shortly after the [Lion King]'s car arrived on time, [Dan Ding] took a few steps back, caught the tracker he threw, and hurried back to place the tracker on a car identical to the delivery van. The tense and exciting perfect car switch plan successfully blinded Rice's eyes.
0:28:2|0:28:11|The commander called and questioned Bill, and Bill told the commander.
0:28:18|0:28:26|He promised himself that he would definitely find the car back. At this moment, the [Lion King] who successfully completed the mission returned to the agreed location with the spoils.
0:28:26|0:28:34|[Lulu] and [Mouse] had been waiting in the abandoned factory for a long time. Two cars returned safely, and [Mouse] stood by, smiling and giving them a thumbs up.
0:28:48|0:28:56|[Dan Ding] kicked the flattened tire twice and then opened the door of the delivery van, shocking everyone inside.
0:28:56|0:29:2|Unexpectedly, inside the car door was a meticulously designed password-protected door.
0:29:3|0:29:8|Next, the knowledgeable [Mouse] immediately picked up the computer and tried to unlock it.
0:29:8|0:29:13|The password door opens, and everyone looks inside in astonishment.
0:30:12|0:30:23|Bill stared at [Volcano] incredulously for a long time, looked around, and then turned to the angry crowd in front of him.
0:30:44|0:30:52|A car stopped in front of everyone, the door opened, and a person wearing sunglasses got out of the car with two bodyguards.
0:30:54|0:31:0|Bill turned around and told Rice.
0:31:30|0:31:36|Volcano was stunned in place, while Lion King fired a gun as a signal.
0:31:38|0:31:45|At this moment, [Lion King] panicked and instinctively stepped back, then he slumped down in the back of the car, unsure of what to do next.
0:31:45|0:31:50|As he couldn't match the weapon in his hand, [Volcano] pulled out a grenade from his waist and threw it over.
0:31:52|0:32:4|Dan Ding was covering in the back seat, Mouse was helping Dad walk in front, Old Man deliberately shot and exploded the oil drum, the abandoned car windows splattered everywhere due to the explosion. Everyone hugged their heads and leaped forward, finally escaping from the dangerous place.
0:32:11|0:32:19|[Volcano] provided cover while [Lion King] took out the bullets from the car. After that, [Lion King] threw the bullets to his brothers.
0:32:20|0:32:28|Mouse supported the injured Sir Cao as they escaped, with Dan Ding providing cover behind them. Lion King and Volcano hid behind a car, assisting them in their getaway.
0:32:28|0:32:33|Sir Cao, who was shot, is now unconscious.
0:32:35|0:32:42|[Volcano] looked at [Sir Cao] who fainted in front of him, unable to hold back his anger any longer, he roared and rushed out to shoot.
0:32:42|0:32:51|[Dan Ding] finally managed to get everyone onto the van at the car transfer platform, bullets flying around. [Dan Ding] quickly pulled the switch of the transfer platform.
0:32:56|0:33:2|The Lion King immediately activated the iron hook hanging in the air, and the hook swiftly slid and hit the van.
0:33:2|0:33:7|The fierce impact caused the entire car to overturn on the ground, and [Dan Ding] had to crawl out from the other side of the car window.
0:33:9|0:33:16|Mouse also came out to help Dan Ding lift the car, while Volcano fired a few shots to cover them and then ran to Lion King's side to switch to a machine gun.
0:33:18|0:33:26|[Dan Ding] took the opportunity to successfully get on the car, while [Volcano] behind was covering and shooting wildly with a machine gun.
0:33:26|0:33:33|The car transporter platform moved slowly, with [Dan Ding] staring anxiously, suddenly he started the van, his eyes fixed on the outside of the car.
0:33:33|0:33:42|Only a rapid start-up sound was heard, crashing through the wall and rushing out, before Lai Si's henchmen could react.
0:33:44|0:33:51|[Lion King] drives a small boat to pick up [Volcano], who is facing a large group of enemies. [Volcano] aims at the hydrogen tanks near the enemies and starts shooting.
0:33:51|0:33:57|With a deafening roar, shattered car windows flew in all directions, and the enemies screamed in agony.
0:33:59|0:34:5|[Volcano] and [Lion King] immediately jumped into the nearest car and escaped. Rice's men opened fire wildly.
0:34:5|0:34:13|The bodyguards immediately got into the car to chase after the target, with Rice ordering them to take care of the situation. Beside him, [Bill] stared at Rice without saying a word.
0:34:13|0:34:27|On the road, the enemy's car was in hot pursuit, [Dan Ding] nervously looked in the rearview mirror, only to see [Lion King] and [Volcano] driving behind unable to catch up. The two of them got into a quarrel because they had accidentally injured their father.
0:34:30|0:34:38|[Volcano] remained silent with a stern face, as a burst of machine gun fire erupted. [Lion King] and [Volcano] exchanged a glance as several cars were closely chasing them from behind.
0:34:38|0:34:50|In an abandoned factory, [Lion King] is standing in front of a delivery truck filled with gold, his hands in his pockets, looking proud of his success. He then turns around and walks towards [Bill].
0:34:59|0:35:1|He then gave him a heavy punch in the stomach.
0:35:1|0:35:10|[Bill] bent over in pain, clutching his stomach. Emphasized [Lion King].
0:35:17|0:35:25|[Rice] kept repeating his warning, [Bill] quickly pulled out a gun and pointed it at him. [Rice] was so scared that he hid behind the bodyguard. [Bill] pushed the bodyguard aside and fired the gun.
0:35:26|0:35:35|Rice was shot dead, Bill turned his head to look at the bodyguard next to him, who was staring at him, not daring to move.
0:35:35|0:35:39|With a cold look in his eyes, he walked closer with a gun in his hand.
0:35:45|0:35:51|At this moment, gunshots rang out on the street, and [Dan Ding] clenched his neck tightly to steady the steering wheel.
0:35:51|0:36:0|Mouse pops out and shoots the car behind. On the other side, Volcano drives the car dodging left and right, while Lion King sticks out half of his body and shoots at the enemies behind.
0:36:2|0:36:9|[Lion King] jumped out of the car, rolled a few times, then immediately got up and drove away the parked vehicles on the side of the road.
0:36:10|0:36:14|He seized the opportunity to change lanes immediately and forcefully collided with the enemy's car body.
0:36:16|0:36:22|The vehicles on the road were in chaos, with [Lion King] driving out, followed by several other cars immediately changing lanes to overtake and catch up.
0:36:26|0:36:33|The scene returns to the airport, where there are scattered bodies lying in the aftermath of the explosion.
0:36:33|0:36:42|A group of black-clothed people were observing around, with Lion King lying there without breathing, the commander looked at the body in front of him with cold eyes.
0:36:42|0:36:46|On the tree-lined street, a sudden blare of horns could be heard.
0:36:46|0:36:56|[Volcano] is gritting his teeth and driving at high speed, while [Lion King] is dodging attacks from the sides. At this moment, the enemies are sticking out of the car, their weapons ready to strike.
0:36:56|0:37:4|[Lion King] saw the cannon from the rearview mirror, immediately turned the steering wheel, a cannon shot out quickly, [Lion King] changed the direction of travel and successfully avoided it.
0:37:4|0:37:13|The car passing by was engulfed in flames with the sound of intense explosions, lining up along the street.
0:37:13|0:37:20|On the other side, the enemies drove forward in front and behind [Volcano], as a tram slowly approached on the street ahead.
0:37:20|0:37:25|[Dan Ding] speeds up and passes smoothly. [Volcano] barely makes it past by turning in front of the car.
0:37:26|0:37:33|Lion King, who was charging at the back, couldn't bear to watch any longer. He swung his tail, flipped the car sideways, and the tram was cut off, sliding off the road.
0:37:39|0:37:43|Volcano ordered Dan Ding to leave first, then immediately reversed the car to help Lion King.
0:37:44|0:37:50|But the damaged tram is blocking the way in the middle, and the enemies on the other side are shooting at [Lion King]'s car.
0:37:50|0:37:56|[Volcano] gritted his teeth, stepped on the gas pedal hard, and the whole car rushed out along the iron plate beside it.
0:37:56|0:38:11|At this moment, the pursued [Lion King] is still in a difficult situation. [Lion King] swings the tail of the car, deliberately hitting the parked cars on the side of the road, trying to create obstacles. The enemy's car clings tightly and won't let go, [Lion King] frowns.
0:38:11|0:38:20|Suddenly a sign appeared on the side of the road, reminding [Lion King]. He quickly made a sharp turn in the new direction, causing pedestrians on the roadside to scream in fear.
0:38:20|0:38:25|The destination was in sight, and he honked the horn as he rushed past.
0:38:30|0:38:35|The Lion King crashed into the police station, and his enemies dared not make any rash moves, lingering at the door for a while before leaving.
0:38:37|0:38:42|Volcano, who arrived late, widened his eyes when he saw this scene.
0:38:53|0:39:5|The police immediately pressed him down, handcuffed him, [Volcano] watched as [Lion King] was arrested. He drove slowly past the police station, constantly looking back at [Lion King]. [Lion King] gestured at him to leave quickly.
0:39:5|0:39:12|After some hesitation, [Volcano] drove away, leaving [Lion King] watching him depart safely, closing his eyes in relief.
0:39:12|0:39:27|The scene shifts to the memory of [Lion King]. In the memory, this is the first time [Lion King] and his brothers met [Sir Cao], several years ago, when [Sir Cao] brought them home from prison.
0:42:12|0:42:19|The cold prison life has just begun, and [Lion King] can only bear it alone.
0:42:30|0:42:40|The news of using children as subjects for drug experiments made his originally smiling eyes immediately turn dark, [Mouse] opened a Japanese restaurant in Japan, and he is currently bowing to see off the guests.
0:42:43|0:42:50|The traitorous [Bill] is lying on the genuine leather sofa, staring at the two pieces of gold on the coffee table lost in thought.
0:42:50|0:43:1|At this moment, Dr. Zhou in the refugee camp in Africa received a package containing a glass bottle with a seedling inside. She held it in her hand for a long time, then planted it.
0:43:3|0:43:9|The commander who has experienced changes is sitting at his desk with his eyes closed in contemplation. At this moment, in the prison, [Lion King] is using a ruler in his hand to calculate the dates.
0:43:9|0:43:17|The [Mouse] in the sushi restaurant turned to look at the calendar on the wall, while [Dan Ding] outside the tavern was handing over the management of his shop to someone else.
0:43:24|0:43:33|As time passed, the seedlings planted by Dr. Zhou had grown strong, and she looked at the vitality before her, with a glimmer in her eyes.
0:43:33|0:43:39|At this moment, the prison door is opened, and [Lion King] walks out under the escort of the prison guard.
0:43:39|0:43:45|Outside the door, another rolling shutter slowly rises, and [Lion King] looks outside, his eyes somewhat uneasy.
0:43:46|0:44:0|He walked out, looked up, then glanced around. Outside the prison, it was eerily quiet, only the sound of the rolling shutter behind him could be heard. Then, he held his clothes in one hand and fumbled in his pocket with the other.
0:44:0|0:44:5|Yu Guangzhong noticed a car parked in front of him, and saw [Dan Ding] getting out of the car, smiling at him.
0:44:7|0:44:17|[Lion King] looked at him, smiled and walked over. Although they didn't speak, the deep brotherly bond between them was already understood.
0:44:21|0:44:32|Walking through the bustling streets, [Dan Ding] led [Lion King] to a dilapidated house, the two of them winding their way to the entrance. [Lion King] caught sight of the scene inside, his gaze fixed on the doorway.
0:44:32|0:44:39|Inside the door, many ragged wanderers gathered in this small room, with [Lion King] speaking to [Dan Ding].
0:44:44|0:44:48|[Lion King] and [Dan Ding] observed their surroundings while walking towards the inside.
0:44:48|0:44:56|Suddenly, they both stopped in their tracks and followed their gaze, only to see [Volcano] sitting there with a gray, tattered knitted hat on his head.
0:44:56|0:45:4|Disheveled hair and a stubbly face seemed to be connected. [Volcano] felt someone watching him, so he looked up.
0:45:4|0:45:6|Recognizing the two familiar figures.
0:45:6|0:45:13|He looked up and down, confirming that the two people in front of him were not an illusion, tears gradually welling up in his eyes.
0:45:13|0:45:26|He quickly turned his face away, picked up the iron box that had been prepared long ago, and walked towards the other side. He took the shovel to give to his friend, then hugged goodbye. After that, he said goodbye one by one to the homeless man next to him.
0:45:26|0:45:32|[Lion King] and [Dan Ding] waited silently behind him, then [Volcano] walked back and took the coat on the hanger.
0:45:32|0:45:43|Next to the old wardrobe, the vertical lines drawn with chalk were particularly prominent. As he took off his coat, he glanced at the cabinet door, then turned and put on his clothes before walking away.
0:45:43|0:45:52|The camera zooms in on the cabinet door, the vertical lines becoming clearer and clearer, revealing the last traces of closure from yesterday.
0:45:52|0:46:1|[Volcano] walked up behind [Lion King], with his back facing him. [Lion King] turned around and asked. He didn't say anything, but turned around to meet [Lion King]'s gaze.
0:46:1|0:46:4|The two stared at each other for a long time, and then [Volcano] spoke.
0:46:9|0:46:16|[Lion King] looked at the now completely different [Volcano] in front of him, his chest heaving violently, whether out of anger or sadness, it was hard to tell.
0:46:40|0:46:45|A joke offset all the guilt, and the brothers set out on a new journey again.
0:46:54|0:47:1|The train heading to the destination crossed mountains and rivers, heading towards the distance. The three brothers arrived in Kumamoto, Japan.
0:47:1|0:47:9|At the peaceful foot of the mountain, surrounded by a small village with houses of the same style scattered around, three people arrived at the sushi restaurant owned by [Mouse].
0:47:10|0:47:13|Mouse heard a noise and quickly stuck his head out of the small window to greet.
0:47:21|0:47:28|Then he stepped forward, embraced him, and [Lion King] grabbed [Mouse]'s hand and pulled him in front of him, the two of them bumped shoulders.
0:47:28|0:47:34|Volcano just nodded from a distance, and Mouse nodded in response.
0:47:49|0:47:52|[Volcano] lowered his head after hearing it, his eyes constantly avoiding.
0:47:52|0:47:58|[Lulu] sighed and walked over, [Volcano] saw [Lulu] with open arms.
0:48:0|0:48:5|Holding back the tears in his eyes, he then hugged [Lulu] and asked.
0:48:10|0:48:16|He then walked in and pushed open the other half of the door, with [Sir Cao] in the wheelchair smiling at them.
0:48:16|0:48:25|The smiles on Lion King and Volcano's faces suddenly disappeared, and Lion King turned to look at Dan Ding.
0:48:25|0:48:41|Subsequently, as they walked, [Sir Cao] took off the shoulder bag and smiled, raising one hand. [Lion King] bent down and tightly held it, then [Dan Ding] walked up and reached out his hand.
0:48:42|0:48:49|[Sir Cao] smiled and shook hands with [Dan Ding], then he looked back and saw [Volcano] turning his head away, not daring to look at him.
0:48:54|0:49:0|The guilty [Volcano] tried hard to control his emotions, he walked up and knelt in front of [Sir Cao].
0:49:1|0:49:6|[Sir Cao] slapped [Volcano] hard across the face, and the brothers around him all lowered their heads, their faces solemn.
0:49:6|0:49:16|Then he dragged [Volcano] in front of himself and said.
0:50:0|0:50:6|Volcano cried and threw himself into Sir Cao's arms, and Lulu couldn't help but shed tears when she saw this scene.
0:51:4|0:51:9|[Volcano] gave a meaningful look to [Lion King].
0:52:8|0:52:15|[Old Man] tells everyone that the new wine festival will be held next week, and he wants to invite everyone to help with the festival ceremony.
0:52:31|0:52:36|After everyone agreed, [Sir Cao] made a gesture and smiled, speaking in Japanese.
0:52:36|0:52:48|With the rhythmic whistle, the village's wine offering ceremony officially begins, with the four brothers drumming on either side of the shrine, and the villagers joyfully dancing.
0:53:25|0:53:31|In the eyes of the elderly in Japan, the importance of brewing details can be summed up in four words: a lifetime of mystery.
0:53:35|0:53:41|The Lion King did not respond and changed the subject directly.
0:53:46|0:53:50|Sir Cao glanced at him for a few seconds, then handed him the folding fan in his hand.
0:53:50|0:53:54|[Lion King] took the fan and opened it, inside was written the words "Choose Good" in a flowing script.
0:54:0|0:54:4|[Lion King] understands the reason behind this, which is the answer that Sir Cao gave to himself.
0:54:4|0:54:11|He looked up at Sir Cao ahead of him, who turned around and responded with a determined look.
0:54:11|0:54:21|The scene returns to the wine offering ceremony, with [Lion King] laughing and drumming, while his brothers shout slogans beside him, enjoying the moment of revelry.
0:54:22|0:54:31|The sake ritual entered its final stage, with the elderly Japanese man using a large wooden hammer to directly open the lid of the sake barrel. Everyone poured the sake into cups one by one and raised their glasses in celebration.
0:54:31|0:54:35|After a long day of work, the brothers treated themselves to a hot spring to relax.
0:54:55|0:54:59|Mouse accidentally mentioned Bill, and everyone stopped laughing and playing around.
0:54:59|0:55:4|[Volcano] backed away with a stern face, leaning against a rock, creating an awkward atmosphere.
0:55:4|0:55:7|Next, [Mouse] said.
0:56:1|0:56:8|That night in Budapest, [Volcano] felt that something was off with [Bill], so he followed him to the railing.
0:56:8|0:56:15|[Bill] knew he couldn't hide the truth from [Volcano]'s eyes. After much hesitation, he started to reveal his innermost secret.
0:56:39|0:56:46|After everyone learned about the difficulties of [Bill], they fell silent for a long time. [Dan Ding] glanced at [Volcano] across from him, then looked to the side.
0:56:46|0:56:55|At this moment, [Lion King] rolled his eyes, lost in thought. Then he swam over and said, "..."
0:56:55|0:56:58|The Lion King recalls the meeting with the intelligence officer.
0:57:11|0:57:21|[Dan Ding] spoke up, interrupting his thoughts.
0:57:40|0:57:48|[Lion King] finished speaking and looked at everyone. The brothers understood without saying a word, silently nodding.
0:57:48|0:57:51|Two weeks later, everyone arrived at the car show.
0:57:51|0:57:58|In the magnificent city center square, people come and go, with uniquely designed cars scattered throughout the venue.
0:57:58|0:58:4|The beautiful car model poses on the side for photos, then suddenly walks over to promote the car.
0:58:14|0:58:20|[Dan Ding] sat in the car observing the surroundings, while [Mouse] monitored the entrance of the venue in real time.
0:58:37|0:58:44|At this moment, a car stopped at the entrance of the venue, and the man who got out of the passenger seat opened the rear door.
0:58:52|0:58:57|After [Mouse] finished speaking, [Lion King] identified the target and immediately started to act, quickly catching up with the man in front.
0:59:5|0:59:10|After Lion King finished speaking, he continued to follow up. Unexpectedly, the man suddenly turned around. Lion King quickly moved away, pretending to gaze fixedly.
0:59:10|0:59:15|Facing the man, [Volcano] also picked up the leaflet in his hand to demonstrate.
0:59:25|0:59:32|The two immediately stepped forward, and suddenly, the computer screen of [Mouse] was switched off.
0:59:39|0:59:45|At this moment, [Sir Cao] inside the house heard [Lulu]'s cry, he immediately took out his gun and hid it under the blanket covering his legs.
0:59:47|0:59:53|The man pretending to be [Bill] outside the door turned around, leaving [Volcano] stunned in place, then quickly fired a shot.
0:59:53|1:0:1|People ran around with their heads in their hands, [Volcano] immediately ran to hide behind the iron plate. On the other side, [Lion King] ran and shot at the people chasing from behind.
1:0:1|1:0:10|After that, he fled into the venue. After [Volcano] dealt with the trouble in front of him, he shot and killed a person chasing [Lion King], but also exposed his own position.
1:0:10|1:0:16|The brothers are facing a hail of bullets outside, and at this moment, [Sir Cao] is also in danger.
1:0:16|1:0:34|He rolled his wheelchair out of the bedroom and into the hallway. Subsequently, each bedroom door in front of him was slowly pushed open, with several men in black appearing on both sides of the hallway. The last bedroom door was pushed open, and [Lulu] was grabbed from behind and forcefully pushed out. Upon seeing this scene, [Sir Cao]'s eyes instantly turned fierce.
1:0:34|1:0:41|At the end of the corridor, [Bill] slowly walks out from inside, looking into [Sir Cao]'s eyes without any emotion.
1:0:41|1:0:56|At this moment in the venue, [Lion King] is still dodging around, with no bullets left in his gun. In desperation, he throws the empty gun at the opponent, then forcefully knocks down the iron frame next to him. Immediately after, he quickly runs behind a racing car.
1:0:56|1:1:4|[Lion King] leaned against the car window for a moment, then leaped inside, but the start-up device of this new luxury car left him dumbfounded.
1:1:4|1:1:11|Soon after, [Lion King] randomly pressed a button and the sports car started successfully, with the people behind also driving a sports car to catch up.
1:1:11|1:1:18|Outside, [Volcano] is blocked by the opponent behind the iron plate and can't get out. At this moment, [Dan Ding] drives in.
1:1:25|1:1:33|[Lulu]'s phone call couldn't get through. [Dan Ding] reversed the car, breaking their decorative light bulbs. Hurriedly chasing after the enemy car, they were blocked by the dropped light bulb.
1:1:36|1:1:44|At this moment, [Bill] bent down while [Sir Cao] raised his head and said expressionlessly.
1:2:26|1:2:36|[Sir Cao] slowly raised his head and stared at the insincere [Bill], then he spoke. [Bill] frowned and looked into [Sir Cao]'s eyes, then he stood up with a wry smile and said.
1:2:38|1:2:48|With the sound of intense impact, the decorative glass outside the venue splintered in all directions. At this moment, [Lion King] drove a sports car, burst through the wall from inside the venue, and the enemy car followed suit.
1:2:51|1:2:59|At this moment, several cars started to reverse one after another, with other vehicles on the road avoiding them. [Dan Ding] followed at the end, stepping on the gas pedal desperately chasing forward.
1:3:0|1:3:9|[Lion King] saw the enemy car behind getting closer, so he had to accelerate forward. [Dan Ding] watched as [Lion King]'s car in front of him got farther and farther away.
1:3:16|1:3:23|On the other side, two sports cars were racing crazily on the road, the sound of the engines roaring echoed throughout the street.
1:3:23|1:3:30|Vehicles on the road are avoiding being hit. Unfortunately, the driving force of [Lion King]'s sports car begins to decline.
1:3:30|1:3:37|As the enemy vehicle is about to approach the car, inside the house, [Bill] hears the words "surrender" and smiles bitterly.
1:4:20|1:4:27|It turns out that Ma Wen was killed by [Bill], in order to avoid suspicion, he shot himself pretending to be injured.
1:4:53|1:5:5|Sir Cao raised his hand in anger to slap, but was stopped by [Bill]. At this moment, the Japanese old man suddenly ran in, [Bill] turned to look, his fierce eyes instantly softened. He let go of Sir Cao's hand and turned to the wheelchair.
1:5:5|1:5:11|Sir Cao did not answer, just stared at the old man in front of him without saying a word.
1:5:22|1:5:34|The old man finished speaking and pushed Sir Cao out of the house. [Bill] sneered as he watched the old man's back, while the men in black around slowly closed the doors of each bedroom. Sir Cao sat heavily in his wheelchair.
1:5:34|1:5:44|At this moment, the door leading to the outside was also closed, leaving the two of them stranded in place. [Sir Cao] knew that things wouldn't be easily resolved, so he spoke up.
1:5:46|1:5:56|[Bill] said nothing, just gave a signal from the side. The black-clothed man behind shouted loudly and rushed forward with a fist raised. The Japanese old man lifted his leg, took a step back, and knocked the man over. Seeing this, the black-clothed man in front...
1:5:56|1:5:58|Proceed with caution.
1:5:58|1:6:3|At this moment, [Lion King] is still being chased frantically by someone.
1:6:3|1:6:7|Dan Ding drives while searching for Lion King.
1:6:8|1:6:18|Just now, [Dan Ding] drifted and blocked an enemy car behind him. The people behind were puzzled and tried to overtake, but [Dan Ding] immediately moved left and right to prevent the enemy from succeeding.
1:6:18|1:6:26|At this moment, [Lion King] swerved again from another intersection, with the enemy car beside showing no sign of backing off. The vehicles following the turn were too scared to move.
1:6:26|1:6:38|At this moment, the roadside stall is still in business, and in the middle of the road, [Dan Ding] is still maneuvering with the car. Suddenly, he accelerates and turns the steering wheel to the right, causing the enemy car parallel to him to crash into the stall.
1:6:38|1:6:45|The items from the stall flew into the sky, making it hard to see. Pushing forward, they unexpectedly reached the end of the stall, which turned out to be a sloping iron frame.
1:6:45|1:6:51|The car flew along the iron frame, then crashed into the traffic light above, and finally overturned on the ground.
1:6:51|1:6:55|After resolving the trouble, [Dan Ding] immediately rushed over according to the route pointed out by [Mouse].
1:6:55|1:7:1|At this moment, [Lion King] encountered another big trouble, the road ahead is under construction, and the side road leads to the shopping mall.
1:7:1|1:7:7|[Lion King] had no choice but to drive down the alley with the horn blaring, causing pedestrians on the right to quickly dodge to the sides.
1:7:7|1:7:16|[Dan Ding] looked at [Lion King], driving a sports car straight through the entrance of the mall. He was about to step on the gas, but [Mouse] pointed out a new route.
1:7:18|1:7:26|At this moment, the [Lion King] in the mall is driving at the front, and the items on display inside are all knocked over. Suddenly, an umbrella pierces halfway through the car window.
1:7:26|1:7:30|[Lion King] dodged to the side, then freed up one hand to push the umbrella stick out.
1:7:31|1:7:38|In the next second, [Lion King]'s car crashes through the glass again, returning to the road, but a new problem arises.
1:7:39|1:7:47|After Lion King finished speaking, the sports car behind him slowly approached the side of his car, and then rubbed against Lion King's car body as it drove forward.
1:7:47|1:7:54|To control the speed of the Lion King's car, the enemies kept hitting the car body, and the Lion King sitting inside had no resistance at all.
1:7:54|1:8:2|At this moment, another enemy vehicle also accelerated and caught up, directly hitting the rear of [Lion King]'s car, rubbing all the way to run parallel.
1:8:2|1:8:10|Outside the car, sparks of various colors, [Lion King] is trying to escape desperately, turning the steering wheel left and right, while the enemies are squeezing towards the middle at the same time.
1:8:10|1:8:18|[Lion King], trapped between two cars, unable to move, glanced at the map and said, [Dan Ding].
1:8:27|1:8:34|The Lion King suddenly stopped, and the cars on both sides were all ejected and collided due to inertia.
1:8:34|1:8:43|Dan Ding's car crashed through the glass building, directly hitting the enemy car parked together. The two cars didn't have time to react and were crashed into the neighboring reception room.
1:8:43|1:8:45|Roll down the stairs at the end.
1:8:45|1:8:53|After escaping the danger, [Lion King] drove forward and said, "Dan Ding" nodded at [Lion King] and immediately followed.
1:8:53|1:9:9|At this moment, the elderly Japanese man in the country is fighting against the men in black. The mediocre martial arts skills of these people are no match for him. He easily throws one of them over his shoulder, causing him to fall to the ground. Then, another person rushes forward, and the old man, feeling his strength waning, reaches for the samurai sword on the cabinet.
1:9:9|1:9:24|Who would have expected that as soon as he stood up, a bullet pierced into his stomach. Father witnessed his good friend dying in front of him, and despairingly called out the old man's name. The old man responded to Father Cao with a trembling voice, as his hands gradually fell down.
1:9:24|1:9:30|Behind him, [Bill] slowly holstered his gun, and Sir Cao turned his wheelchair to question him.
1:10:3|1:10:8|[Bill] reached out to grab the blanket, only to find a hand holding a gun inside.
1:10:8|1:10:12|His eyes immediately turned fierce, and the gun in his hand also seemed ready to move.
1:10:12|1:10:18|[Sir Cao] pressed him with one hand and pulled out a gun with the other, pointing it at his chin. The gun went off.
1:10:18|1:10:26|[Bill] looked shocked, [Sir Cao] fell to the ground, while the bodyguard stood behind holding a gun, [Bill] tremblingly stood up.
1:10:26|1:10:32|He took a few steps back as he watched [Sir Cao] fall to the ground, then his hand holding the gun also loosened.
1:10:32|1:10:36|He then walked up to the security guard, staring with his eyes wide open,
1:10:39|1:10:50|[Bill] grabbed the bodyguard's collar and shouted loudly. At this moment, [Lulu] was brought in by someone.
1:11:12|1:11:33|[Bill] looked at [Sir Cao] lying on the ground, the bodyguard walked past him and then turned to look at [Bill]. The people below saw the boss getting angry and quietly left the scene. [Bill] stood still, his chest heaving, the blood splattered on his face looking particularly ferocious. Then, he looked at his father's body and slowly backed out of the room.
1:11:33|1:11:39|A few days ago, the lively Japanese restaurant is now as silent as death. The body of [Sir Cao]
1:11:39|1:11:44|Lying on the side with eyes wide open, holding the gun tightly in hand, the room was a mess.
1:11:44|1:11:50|Outside the Japanese restaurant, the sound of footsteps could be heard, and the four brothers finally rushed back.
1:11:56|1:12:3|Mouse knelt in front of Dad, crying with his head in his hands, while Volcano slowly lowered his head and heavily knocked it on the floor.
1:12:3|1:12:9|[Lion King], after seeing his father's body, leaned against the nearby cabinet and slowly sat down.
1:12:9|1:12:17|Tears flowed uncontrollably. In a few days, it would be Sir Cao's funeral.
1:12:46|1:12:55|The four brothers, with devout hearts, revered the man who was willing to sacrifice himself for his brothers, and then they arrived at Sir Cao's memorial hall.
1:13:25|1:13:30|[Lion King] recalls a birthday celebration where everyone put the cake on his face while his father was making a wish.
1:13:57|1:14:5|The anger in his eyes seemed to surpass the sadness. After the sadness, the four of them walked out of the funeral parlor, with [Volcano] suppressing his anger and leading the way.
1:14:8|1:14:16|Mouse finished speaking, everyone stopped in their tracks and turned to look at him. Seeing the anger in everyone's eyes, Mouse took a deep breath and said, with Volcano glaring at him darkly.
1:14:24|1:14:33|The emotions of the group calmed down, and after hearing that, Volcano looked at Lion King, then turned and quickly walked out, with Dan Ding immediately following.
1:14:33|1:14:38|The Lion King did not stop, instead he came over to comfort the Mouse. The Lion King patted the crying Mouse gently.
1:14:40|1:14:46|They then walked forward. At this moment, a map to Black Mountain appeared on the screen.
1:14:46|1:14:57|In the pitch-black tunnel, a glimmer of light appeared as the four brothers drove their cars roaring past. The winding mountain road only had the four brothers' cars moving in unison towards their destination.
1:15:27|1:15:34|In the evening, everyone sat in the tavern drinking, [Dan Ding] picked up the bottle and clinked it.
1:15:36|1:15:40|After speaking, [Dan Ding] poured all the wine into another wine glass and placed it in the middle.
1:15:40|1:15:53|The Lion King and the others raised their glasses and clinked them with Dad's glass. After clinking, the four of them drank up, then placed the glasses on the table. Volcano finished the drink, turned his head away, unwilling to look at the glass.
1:15:53|1:16:0|Sitting next to him, [Mouse] kept silent with his head down, while [Lion King] paused for a moment before continuing.
1:16:14|1:16:26|At this moment, no one was willing to answer the question, and everyone fell silent. A car pulled up in front of the tavern, and the [Lion King]s walked over.
1:16:28|1:16:32|The intelligence officer got out of the car and told [Lion King] that he had kept his promise and brought what [Lion King] wanted.
1:16:33|1:16:38|The opponent opened the trunk, and [Volcano] stepped forward to inspect. The trunk was filled with a large number of weapons and bullets.
1:16:49|1:16:57|As for how to handle it, it's up to [Bill] or the [Lion King]. After saying that, he reached out his hand to shake hands with the [Lion King], who just glanced at him.
1:17:5|1:17:9|The other party provided another piece of information about [Bill].
1:17:29|1:17:35|The atmosphere was eerily quiet at this moment, as the operation was about to begin.
1:17:43|1:17:50|After speaking, [Dan Ding] immediately started the car. On the shore, [Mouse] and [Volcano] plunged into the water, and the attack plan began.
1:17:52|1:18:0|The soldiers on the island were startled by the sudden attack, [Bill] turned his head upon hearing the noise, and a cold light shot out from his dark eyes.
1:18:0|1:18:5|At this moment, the previously panicked soldiers are now prepared to face the enemy.
1:18:5|1:18:11|The Lion King quickly popped out his head and fired a shot towards the bridge, directly destroying the opponent's observation deck.
1:18:11|1:18:23|At this moment, [Mouse] and [Volcano] successfully reached the shore. In front of them was a cliff about 10 meters high. The two of them took out rope guns and hooked onto the topmost rock, then quickly climbed upwards.
1:18:23|1:18:34|At this point, [Lion King] and [Dan Ding] were already driving deep into enemy territory. While [Dan Ding] was steering the wheel, he was also firing a machine gun, with [Mouse] and [Volcano] sneaking into the perimeter of the house.
1:18:34|1:18:40|He leaped over the railing gracefully and landed, before the enemies could react, his neck was twisted by [Volcano] behind him.
1:18:40|1:18:48|They then killed the guards outside the control room and arrived at a hidden password-protected door, where [Mouse] used the unlocking device to successfully enter.
1:18:48|1:19:3|At this moment, [Dan Ding] and [Lion King] are braving the gunfire to reach the final level, with the iron gate in front becoming the only obstacle to entering the island.
1:19:5|1:19:9|After speaking, [Mouse] pressed the switch, and the gate began to slowly descend.
1:19:9|1:19:14|Someone grabbed [Mouse] from behind, causing the gate to stop descending.
1:19:15|1:19:20|[Dan Ding] was forced to stop in front of the gate, with the enemies slowly closing in behind him.
1:19:22|1:19:25|At this moment, [Mouse] is struggling.
1:19:26|1:19:32|[Dan Ding] was puzzled, and at this moment the camera gradually pulled back.
1:19:33|1:19:40|[Volcano] appears with his back facing the camera. After speaking, [Volcano] furrows his brow, secretly pulls the trigger, and a bullet hits the enemy right in the forehead.
1:19:40|1:19:46|The Lion King took advantage of the chaos to fire shots in succession, pushing back the soldiers who were getting closer.
1:19:46|1:19:54|[Volcano] Another bullet successfully knocked down the gunner. The shell brought by [Volcano] actually fell into the water, causing huge waves.
1:19:54|1:20:3|The enemy suddenly appeared next to [Volcano], he kicked his left leg high against the wall, slid back to a safe position, and then leaned out his upper body to shoot them dead.
1:20:3|1:20:13|Dan Ding's car was constantly shot at from behind as they were flanked.
1:20:13|1:20:21|The gate drops again, and [Dan Ding] immediately steps on the gas pedal hard.
1:20:21|1:20:28|But the car behind was still shooting wildly at the tail of the car. At this moment, [Lion King] took out a bundle of hand grenades, opened the car door and threw them back.
1:20:28|1:20:34|The enemy vehicle couldn't dodge in time, and was completely blown over, with the bridge also being blown apart in the middle.
1:20:39|1:20:51|[Lulu] stood up and shouted, but was pushed down by the person behind her. Sitting next to her, [Bill] gave her a cold look, then got up and walked to the monitor screen, watching the arrival of [Lion King] and others. His expression became worried.
1:20:51|1:20:59|At this moment, [Lion King] and [Volcano] have entered the island, their assault rifles forcing [Dan Ding] to retreat repeatedly.
1:20:59|1:21:6|At this moment, [Lion King] killed the soldier, climbed onto the arch, and then shot the soldier hiding behind with a headshot from the outside movement.
1:21:6|1:21:14|With the rear threat resolved, [Dan Ding] immediately fled forward, with gunshots ringing behind. At this moment, [Lion King] leaped off the arch bridge and shot the man dead.
1:21:14|1:21:17|At this moment, [Volcano] also encountered the enemy's encirclement.
1:21:18|1:21:28|The agile [Volcano] first shoots and kills the enemy, then rolls under the nearby stairs to operate the machine gun above. He then hides in the corner and calls for [Mouse].
1:21:30|1:21:40|Mouse answered Volcano while looking at the surveillance screen inside the house. At this moment, Lulu sat next to Bill without daring to move, with a gunman in black standing on both sides behind them.
1:21:50|1:21:59|[Bill] vented his anger towards [Lulu]. At this moment, [Lion King] and [Dan Ding] climbed to the roof to cover the opposite side, then they hooked the rope on the power line and slid out.
1:21:59|1:22:7|The enemies are unaware of the danger. Just above them, [Lion King] slides along the power line while shooting, safely reaching the other side.
1:22:7|1:22:14|The cunning enemy threw a grenade, and [Lion King] and [Dan Ding] immediately rolled outwards, tumbling and then standing up to shoot.
1:22:14|1:22:18|At this moment, [Lion King] locks eyes with the oil barrel across from him.
1:22:19|1:22:23|With a loud roar, a wave of scorching heat surged into the sky above the island, and flames bloomed brightly.
1:22:25|1:22:34|At this moment, [Dan Ding] somersaulted out of the glass door, with the destination right in front of them. [Lion King] and [Dan Ding] jumped down from upstairs without hesitation.
1:22:34|1:22:48|They broke through the roof and fell to the floor, both of them stood up despite the pain and ran towards the church. At this moment, [Bill] was standing in front of the monitor screen, it turned out that [Lion King] and their every move did not escape his eyes.
1:22:48|1:22:56|The driver who failed to assassinate the [Lion King] before unexpectedly is still alive, with a look of resentment in his eyes.
1:22:56|1:23:4|At this moment, as the enemies grew in number, [Lion King] pulled out the explosive gun hidden behind the slingshot and shot the opponent in the head.
1:23:5|1:23:16|Danny cooperated with Li Kai on the side, and [Lion King] immediately flipped over the wall next to him, jumped onto the wooden box in the air, and then lay down to kill the enemy above him. Due to the swinging force of the wooden box, [Lion King] fell to the ground.
1:23:17|1:23:23|The enemy below tried to shoot, but [Lion King] lying on the ground, shot up along the opponent's knee.
1:23:23|1:23:39|[Dan Ding] was attacked by multiple people. Without noticing, he was shot in the shoulder. At this moment, the enemies in the aisle rushed towards [Volcano]. He quickly grabbed the enemy's hand, flipped him to the ground, and shot him against the temple. Meanwhile, [Mouse] behind him also eliminated the threat above.
1:23:40|1:23:49|The four brothers stopped preparing to shoot at the moment, with smiles on their faces. [Lion King] made a gesture, indicating that the four should act together.
1:23:51|1:23:57|Not long after they set off, [Mouse] was shot in the leg by the enemy. [Volcano] immediately shot and killed the attacker, then helped [Mouse] to the iron cage.
1:23:57|1:24:6|[Lion King] is still dealing with the enemy. At this moment, the lock on the iron gate is opened by [Volcano].
1:24:8|1:24:10|[Dan Ding] immediately went up and helped up the [Mouse] lying on the side.
1:24:10|1:24:16|[Lion King] quickly removed the hand grenade from the enemy's body and crouched on the stone wall.
1:24:18|1:24:29|Stones kept rolling down, burying all the enemies below. At this moment, the door leading to the indoor area was tightly shut, with numerous enemies lurking in various corners of the corridor.
1:24:29|1:24:37|At the entrance, [Bill] stood in the middle with bodyguards, while gunmen on the side held their guns, staring intently at the large door in front of them.
1:24:37|1:24:42|Everyone is holding their breath, waiting for the arrival of a fierce battle.
1:24:42|1:24:54|The corridor leading to the room was eerily quiet at this moment, and the [Lion King] and his companions sensed something was amiss. They hid on both sides of the corridor, waiting for the best moment to strike. [Dan Ding] loaded the bullets into his gun,
1:24:54|1:25:0|Nodding to [Lion King], the opposite [Mouse] also nodded to [Volcano], and the four of them reached a consensus to start their operation.
1:25:1|1:25:5|[Volcano] took the lead and rushed out, the enemies lying in ambush ahead immediately opened fire.
1:25:5|1:25:13|Bullets were flying from all directions, and he was hit twice before he could dodge. [Mouse] dragged his injured leg and continued to shoot while charging forward.
1:25:13|1:25:18|Unexpectedly, he was shot and fell to his knees, but still did not let go of his gun arm.
1:25:18|1:25:27|At this moment, [Dan Ding] knocked down the shooter, ran over to help up [Mouse], and [Lion King] immediately rushed out to cover for his brothers.
1:25:27|1:25:34|Mouse, unable to move due to his injury, tossed his pistol to Lion King. After a short rest, they were ready to strike again.
1:25:34|1:25:43|Who would have expected the big gate suddenly opened, the driver rushed out with a gun, knocking down [Volcano] and [Dan Ding] who were covering on the side, [Lion King] aimed at the driver and fired repeatedly.
1:25:43|1:25:52|Suddenly, a bullet grazed his face, leaving a blood mark. [Lion King] was burning with anger, his gun already pushed to the limit.
1:25:52|1:25:59|Opening it again, he quickly shielded the driver's body in front of him and then fired several shots at the rushing bodyguards.
1:25:59|1:26:12|At this moment, [Dan Ding] immediately rushed over and pinned the injured bodyguard to the ground. Unexpectedly, the bodyguard broke free from the restraint, threw a punch, but [Dan Ding] locked the bodyguard's hands with his feet and together they brought him down, then stood up and fired a gun.
1:26:12|1:26:19|Although the shot hit the body of the driver, it completely enraged the [Lion King], who threw the body aside and roared as he charged forward.
1:26:19|1:26:23|Bill then fired a shot with his restless hand.
1:26:23|1:26:28|Everyone started firing warning shots at him, which scared him back into the glass vault, too scared to come out.
1:26:37|1:26:50|Seeing the Lion King's fierce expression outside the door, Bill's lips trembled and his body involuntarily shook. He looked at the disappointed and resentful eyes of everyone outside the door and shouted.
1:27:48|1:27:52|[Bill] cries out, venting his grievances and anger.
1:27:52|1:27:59|Volcano's face still showed resentment, but his eyes were turning red, while Lion King's angry eyes gradually narrowed.
1:27:59|1:28:7|He lowered his head and paused for a moment, then silently turned around and walked towards [Volcano]. [Mouse] quietly took [Lulu] out.
1:28:35|1:28:41|Bullets were fired at the glass door, hitting it with a crackling sound one by one.
1:28:41|1:28:44|[Bill] legs went weak, involuntarily taking a few steps back.
1:28:44|1:28:51|The hard glass door cracked open, the gap getting wider and wider, like the once strong brotherly bond, now shattered and broken.
1:28:51|1:29:5|Threw a smoke bomb into the crack, [Bill] was choked and coughed repeatedly, then ran out with a gun. He covered his mouth and nose with his arm, raised the handgun ready to fight back. At this moment, everyone held up their guns and mercilessly fired bullets.
1:29:5|1:29:17|The glass door opened, and he fired again. This time, the four brothers dodged the bullets and each aimed at [Bill]'s limbs. Then he collapsed into the pile of gold behind him, staring straight at the brothers who fired.
1:29:17|1:29:26|[Lulu] cried when she saw this scene. At this moment, everyone walked forward, and [Lion King] squatted down and pointed the gun at [Bill]'s head.
1:29:26|1:29:34|Volcano on the side widened his eyes when he saw it. Lion King stared straight at Bill for a long time, then turned back to seek the opinions of his brothers.
1:29:34|1:29:39|Everyone shook their heads at him, but [Lion King] still didn't put down the gun.
1:29:39|1:29:47|After much hesitation, [Lion King] seemed to also start to avoid facing it, pointing the gun at himself, he turned his head and dodged his eyes, then spoke.
1:29:53|1:30:0|He then released the hand on [Bill]'s chin, slowly stood up, and [Mouse] cried out with a hint of tears.
1:30:3|1:30:6|After speaking, [Bill] frowned and looked at everyone.
1:30:6|1:30:14|He was desperate as if falling into a bottomless abyss, utterly despondent, these words piercing deeply into his heart.
1:30:14|1:30:22|In front of him, [Volcano] looked at him quietly, as if he had caught hold of hope, reaching out and grabbing [Volcano]'s shoulder tightly.
1:30:36|1:30:44|[Volcano] shook off his hand and stood up to walk out. The tears in [Bill]'s eyes couldn't be stopped anymore, regretful tears rolled down his face one by one.
1:30:44|1:30:58|Suddenly, he saw a pistol dropped in the gap between the gold, and he picked up the pistol tremblingly and stood up, pointing it at the backs of his brothers, then shouted loudly.
1:30:58|1:31:5|The crowd turned around immediately upon hearing the gunshot, only to see [Volcano] hitting [Bill] in the chest with a shot, causing both of them to fall backwards.
1:31:20|1:31:33|[Bill] took a few steps back and fell to the ground, his feet spreading out as if relieved of a heavy burden. In the end, he ended himself in this way, putting an end to one mistake after another, and ending the brotherhood of this lifetime.
1:31:33|1:31:40|At this moment, everyone turned back nervously to look at [Bill], memories of the past flooding their minds.
1:32:30|1:32:37|In front of the reporters, Lion King was still being asked about the source of the gold. He simply said "no comment" and then turned and walked away.
1:32:37|1:32:43|At this moment, Zhou [Doctor], who is in an African refugee camp, is lifting a cup to drink water.
1:32:43|1:32:51|As time passed, the seedlings on the table had bloomed into numerous bright flowers. Suddenly, the sound of a car starting outside could be heard.
1:32:53|1:33:5|She turned her head and found [Lion King] standing there. Dr. Zhou couldn't believe that the person she had been thinking about day and night was right in front of her. She was stunned for a while, unable to look away. After realizing, she smiled at [Lion King].
1:33:5|1:33:11|[Lion King] stood there from a distance, grinning widely.
