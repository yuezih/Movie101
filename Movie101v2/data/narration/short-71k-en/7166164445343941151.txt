0:2:2|0:2:6|The story begins with a car slowly stopping in front of a residential area.
0:2:6|0:2:18|The man took out a lighter, lit a document with a form, then inserted a USB drive into the laptop, and copied several folders with the names of land acquisition funds into the drive.
0:2:18|0:2:21|The man clenched his fists nervously, his eyes fixed firmly on the screen. [Xu Decai]
0:2:21|0:2:27|After finishing, the man immediately pulled out a USB drive, deleted the files on the computer, and nervously glanced at the clock hanging behind him.
0:2:28|0:2:33|Next, carefully place the USB drive into a small metal box, and pack it into the suitcase.
0:2:33|0:2:41|[Xu Decai] completed all this, stood up straight, looked at himself in the mirror of the liquor cabinet opposite, pursed his lips, and then walked out of the room.
0:2:41|0:2:49|A man sits in the elevator going down. As he walks out of the elevator, the camera behind him slowly starts to turn, closely following his figure.
0:2:49|0:2:56|He hurriedly made his way through the crowd, drove away, and on the highway, it seemed that a large truck was closely following the man's vehicle.
0:2:57|0:3:17|The man turned left, with a large car closely following behind. As the man waited at the traffic lights, in the car behind him, a pair of hands gripping the steering wheel were tapping anxiously. The man furrowed his brow and gradually drove towards the highway. When he turned and approached the toll booth, he saw police officers setting up a checkpoint ahead, stopping and inspecting vehicles.
0:3:52|0:3:59|The man anxiously looked at the road ahead, then turned around and stuffed the suitcase into the back seat.
0:3:59|0:4:2|The man opened the car door and sat in the passenger seat.
0:4:9|0:4:13|A [police officer] walked up in front of the car.
0:4:48|0:4:51|The driver, with a big smile on his face, finished talking to the police and continued driving on the road.
0:5:23|0:5:26|The man angrily took off his sunglasses and glared at the driver.
0:5:26|0:5:31|After a while, the driver turned around and found that the man had already fallen asleep.
0:5:31|0:5:37|The driver gave him a disdainful look, and the car slowly drove into the countryside.
0:5:56|0:6:14|The driver tried to help the man with the suitcase, but was rebuked. The man got off the car to avoid the dog inside, and took the luggage. The driver twitched his ears, sweat dripping down his forehead. He turned and walked towards the counter.
0:6:17|0:6:28|A fierce and menacing middle-aged woman stood up.
0:6:28|0:6:31|Cuihua stared at the driver with her head down.
0:6:31|0:6:41|The woman is still standing there, not leaving.
0:6:41|0:6:43|The woman rolled her eyes.
0:6:47|0:6:50|Before long, the woman placed the beef noodles heavily on the table.
0:6:52|0:6:56|The woman turned and walked away, as the driver glared fiercely at her retreating figure.
0:6:56|0:6:59|At this moment, [Xu Decai] also entered the restaurant.
0:6:59|0:7:2|He walked to the counter and found the boss lady sleeping soundly.
0:7:2|0:7:6|The man quietly opens the refrigerator next to him and takes out a bottle of water.
0:7:6|0:7:9|Suddenly, he noticed the calendar hanging next to the freezer.
0:7:9|0:7:14|Approaching to carefully examine the date, then furrowed his brow. 
0:7:14|0:7:18|The man suddenly relaxed and put on his sunglasses, looking out the window.
0:7:18|0:7:21|At this moment, three young men wearing flip-flops came to the door.
0:7:29|0:7:38|The young man was speaking when another middle-aged man appeared behind him.
0:7:38|0:7:44|As soon as the words fell, everyone in the shop looked up in terror.
0:7:44|0:7:44|The driver was kicked down.
0:8:6|0:8:8|The landlady overturned the table in front of her.
0:8:53|0:8:59|The chair smashed into the man, who was then surrounded and beaten by the young men, with no chance to fight back.
0:8:59|0:9:2|Xu Decai's eyes flashed with a fierce light.
0:9:31|0:9:48|The middle-aged man left with his younger brothers, the man covered his forehead and got up from the ground. Finally, the young man kicked the man again and took his suitcase, then he put the suitcase into the trunk of the eldest brother's car, and they drove away.
0:10:30|0:10:34|The driver looked apologetically at Xu Decai and reached out to brush the debris off his hair.
0:10:37|0:10:41|The man sat on the grass, looking up at the sky.
0:10:59|0:11:6|The man glared at the driver discontentedly, the driver showed a embarrassed expression, then moved closer to the man.
0:11:24|0:11:25|Xu Decai angrily stands up and leaves.
0:11:55|0:12:1|The man no longer replied, just slammed the car door shut heavily, and the two continued on their journey.
0:12:1|0:12:9|On the road, the two remained silent. The man scrolled through his phone messages and saw his own suitcase in a lost and found post online.
0:12:9|0:12:12|The man looked up with a pensive expression, lost in memories.
0:12:31|0:12:34|The woman's hand rests on the man's shoulder.
0:12:43|0:12:47|The man remained silent in contemplation, while the woman poured water and gazed at him upside down.
0:13:28|0:13:36|[Xu Decai] looked dazed, stopped talking, just smiled slightly at the woman, then he stood up and prepared to leave.
0:13:37|0:13:41|The man's back as he walks away stops, but he doesn't turn around.
0:13:53|0:14:1|After speaking, Xu Decai opened the door and left, leaving Wang Xiaobing alone. Her eyes were wandering, as if she was thinking about something.
0:15:13|0:15:18|A man sprayed water onto the car windshield, then the car turned into a yard and stopped.
0:16:1|0:16:4|The man in front moved his chest muscles.
0:16:36|0:16:42|The scene shifts to an abandoned factory where the lighting is dim, and a group of people are playing mahjong.
0:16:42|0:16:47|It's now the turn of a man in a tank top with a large gold chain to draw a tile.
0:16:47|0:16:51|He took the card in his hand and then revealed a satisfied smile.
0:16:51|0:16:52|He slammed the cards onto the table.
0:17:9|0:17:18|Xu Decai's sidekick handed him a cigarette.
0:17:18|0:17:22|The younger brother pulled out a giant lighter, almost burning Xu Decai's eyebrows.
0:17:22|0:17:24|At this moment, the driver and [Xu Decai] arrived at the warehouse.
0:17:28|0:17:30|The driver called the wrong person.
0:18:26|0:18:29|The elder brother splashed a cup of tea on [Xu Decai]'s face.
0:19:16|0:19:17|[Xu Decai] looks at the driver.
0:20:25|0:20:35|Big Brother took a deep drag on his cigarette, looked thoughtfully at the driver, then glanced at the table. He picked up all the money on the table, causing the others at the table to show expressions of heartache.
0:20:54|0:20:57|The driver looked deeply moved.
0:21:3|0:21:5|The driver hurriedly left.
0:21:12|0:21:15|In the courtyard, a man with sunglasses walks in.
0:21:43|0:21:51|The scene shifts, an old man rides a bicycle past, slowly entering a small alley and stopping in front of a house.
0:22:13|0:22:15|The driver started the car again.
0:22:39|0:22:41|The driver stopped [Xu Decai] who was about to leave.
0:22:46|0:22:50|[Xu Decai] walked away in silence.
0:22:50|0:22:56|Behind them, a woman is holding a phone and taking several photos of the driver's car and the dog inside.
0:22:56|0:22:58|In the hospital.
0:23:24|0:23:29|The doctor impatiently looked to the other side, and his eyes lit up when he saw [Xu Decai] in front of him.
0:23:49|0:23:54|[Xu Decai] brushed off the doctor, and when he saw the doctor being called away by a nurse, he quickly grabbed the driver and tried to leave.
0:23:54|0:24:0|The driver stopped him and led him to a ward door, looking through the glass at his daughter lying on the bed.
0:24:0|0:24:8|The woman who was taking care of the child on the side saw the driver, was about to greet him, but then quickly held back, pointed to the sickbed, and got up to walk out.
0:24:10|0:24:31|The woman carefully closed the door and took out the money from her pocket.
0:24:31|0:24:34|The woman looked at her daughter on the sickbed with a heartache.
0:25:10|0:25:18|After finishing the IV drip, the group arrived at the ward. The driver walked to the bedside and looked at his daughter lying on the bed.
0:26:23|0:26:28|The driver gently kissed his daughter's forehead.
0:26:28|0:26:36|The driver smiled and gave a thumbs-up to his daughter, watching her slowly push the door towards the entrance before gently closing the door.
0:26:36|0:26:40|The woman furrowed her brows slightly and gave the driver a faint smile through the glass.
0:26:40|0:26:44|[Xu Decai] patted the driver on the shoulder, and the two of them quietly left.
0:26:44|0:26:49|The clock on the hospital corridor shows that it is 4:01 in the afternoon.
0:26:49|0:26:53|The scene shifts to a young man, Xu Decai, munching on an apple and staring at the computer screen.
0:26:55|0:27:6|The woman on the screen glanced to the side.
0:27:24|0:27:27|The man anxiously looked at the screen, the woman had already gone offline.
0:27:31|0:27:36|The man took off his headphones with a disappointed look on his face, but his attention was soon drawn to the computer screen.
0:27:36|0:27:46|A post on the website called for help to rescue the dog in the car, and the accompanying picture was of the small truck driven by the driver Xu Decai.
0:27:46|0:27:51|The scene shifts to a group of young people standing in the rain with bicycles, the man from earlier can't catch up.
0:27:57|0:28:2|Xu Decai threw the bicycle aside, took the pliers and led the charge, with the young men following closely behind.
0:28:2|0:28:6|Xu Decai used pliers to pry open the cage at the back of the car, and all the puppies jumped out.
0:28:6|0:28:10|Some dogs jumped off the car and fell heavily to the ground because the car was too high.
0:28:10|0:28:16|The guys put up a plank for the dogs to get off the car easily.
0:28:16|0:28:22|After a while, the driver and [Xu Decai] came back.
0:28:22|0:28:23|The driver looks at his car.
0:28:27|0:28:31|The young man who had just left came back to get his bicycle and immediately ran away when he saw the two of them.
0:28:45|0:28:50|The driver dropped the umbrella and chased after the young man, who rode his bike over the puddle on the ground.
0:28:50|0:29:3|The driver stepped into a puddle, soaking his whole body. His wet hair stuck to his forehead as he repeatedly waded through the puddles on the ground, running desperately forward.
0:29:3|0:29:6|The driver caught up with the young man as he rode to the steps.
0:29:36|0:29:44|The driver took off his shoe and smashed it towards the young man, who stood at the alley entrance, looking helplessly in both directions.
0:29:44|0:29:54|The driver showed a look of despair. At this moment, a vigilant sound was heard, and the truck was lifted up and slowly moved forward. The traffic police officer on the side put away the ticket and prepared to leave.
0:30:0|0:30:3|The driver ran up immediately when he saw the traffic police waving.
0:30:31|0:30:49|The traffic policeman rode away on his bike, leaving the driver staring blankly at his receding figure. Feeling helpless, the driver squatted in a corner as the rain continued to pour down, soaking him completely. His shirt clung tightly to his back. At that moment, [Xu Decai] approached him, holding an umbrella. He opened the umbrella above the driver's head.
0:30:50|0:31:6|The driver slowly raised his head and looked at [Xu Decai]. [Xu Decai] silently took out a cigarette from his pocket, lightly tapped the driver's head, handed it to the driver. The driver then took it, shook off the water droplets on his hand, took out a cigarette and put it to his mouth. He lit the cigarette, then handed the cigarette box back to [Xu Decai].
0:32:1|0:32:8|The driver stood up, tears swirling in his eyes.
0:32:48|0:32:52|[Xu Decai] held an umbrella, watching the driver silently shedding tears.
0:32:52|0:32:57|The driver could no longer hold back, burying his head in his shirt and squatting down to cry in pain.
0:32:57|0:33:1|[Xu Decai] opens another umbrella in his hand, shielding the driver from the rain on the other side.
0:33:1|0:33:4|At this moment, [Xu Decai] the driver had already cried his eyes red.
0:33:4|0:33:10|He lifted his head, took the umbrella from [Xu Decai]'s hand, and [Xu Decai] turned and walked slowly towards the alley.
0:33:10|0:33:15|Walking along, Xu Decai noticed that Wang Xiaobing was not following him, so he stopped and turned around to wait.
0:33:15|0:33:23|The driver stood up, wiped his face, removed the rain and tears, tidied up his emotions, and took two small steps forward.
0:33:23|0:33:28|Caught up with [Xu Decai], the two looked at each other and left together shoulder to shoulder.
0:33:30|0:33:38|The scene shifts, dusk falls, and the elderly start gathering in the square to do fitness exercises. [Xu Decai] and the driver walk through the crowd.
0:33:50|0:33:57|The driver stepped forward and pushed the man who was committing violence, but his girlfriend immediately stood up for him.
0:33:57|0:34:2|[Xu Decai] immediately turned around, pointing at the two people with a fierce and intimidating look.
0:34:2|0:34:8|The driver smugly glanced back at the couple before turning around and continuing to walk forward.
0:34:25|0:34:28|A man is standing on the rooftop shouting through a megaphone.
0:34:43|0:34:45|The driver awkwardly turned around and glanced back.
0:35:47|0:36:7|[Xu Decai] patted the driver on the shoulder. The driver lowered his head and walked forward, but suddenly felt something was wrong. He stopped, turned around to look at [Xu Decai], who gave him a meaningful look, then glanced at the rooftop. The driver helplessly continued walking forward and reached the staircase.
0:36:40|0:36:41|Wan Peng pointed at the old man.
0:37:11|0:37:16|Xu Decai kicked this place.
0:37:45|0:37:53|The scene changes, with [Xu Decai] sitting on the edge of the bed wrapped in a towel, while the sound of things falling can be heard from the bathroom.
0:38:12|0:38:16|[Xu Decai] quickly grabbed the clothes and hung them up.
0:38:32|0:38:47|[Xu Decai] threw the towel to the driver. After a while, the driver covered his head with the towel, carefully opened the door, peeked at what [Xu Decai] was doing, then came out. He wiped his head slowly and cautiously lit up the room. Seeing the big bed in the room, he frowned and showed a hesitant expression.
0:39:14|0:39:25|[Xu Decai] looked at the driver's cartoon underwear and slapped him.
0:39:25|0:39:27|[Xu Decai] closed his eyes and silently touched his forehead.
0:39:48|0:39:54|The driver half sat up, knelt by the bed, stared at [Xu Decai], and then relentlessly lay back on the bed.
0:40:6|0:40:13|[Xu Decai] angrily leaned back and kicked towards the driver.
0:40:13|0:40:19|The driver leaned back and soon started snoring. [Xu Decai] put the phone on his face pretending to be charming.
0:40:19|0:40:29|He reached out to take the phone off his face, opened his eyes to look at the ceiling, glanced at the driver snoring beside him, and reached out to turn off the bedside lamp.
0:40:30|0:40:41|In the darkness, [Xu Decai] opened his eyes, a thin layer of sweat forming on his forehead. He stared expressionlessly at the ceiling, as if lost in thought.
0:40:41|0:40:50|In the early morning, the driver was fast asleep. Suddenly, the phone rang. [Xu Decai] was sitting in bed, with his head covered by a pillow, struggling to find his phone.
0:41:22|0:41:36|The scene changes, the elevator door opens, a beautiful woman in a tight skirt stands in the middle of the elevator. [Xu Decai] steps out of the elevator, sees the driver still staring at the woman up and down, pulls the driver away, the woman looks at the driver and rolls her eyes persistently.
0:43:25|0:43:26|He looked down at himself.
0:45:42|0:45:47|There is a silver box in the trunk.
0:46:9|0:46:10|In the blink of an eye.
0:46:50|0:46:56|The two of them looked at the man in confusion.
0:49:15|0:49:19|The two of them quietly waited for the boxing match to finish before playing mahjong.
0:49:56|0:49:58|The front desk impatiently rolled their eyes.
0:50:51|0:50:54|After getting things done.
0:51:24|0:51:30|The store clerk was puzzled, [Xu Decai] walked to the door and answered the phone.
0:52:47|0:52:52|A middle-aged stranger speaks.
0:52:52|0:52:59|The driver bursts into the office.
0:52:59|0:53:0|The driver reaches out to grab the box.
0:53:9|0:53:15|[Xu Decai] walked out of the office and found a small compartment next to it, filled with various equipment.
0:53:53|0:53:59|[Xu Decai] suddenly stopped in his tracks, and the scene shifted to a woman browsing handbags in the store.
0:53:59|0:54:2|At this moment, the phone rang, and she picked up the call after seeing the caller ID.
0:54:7|0:54:9|The driver wanted to approach, but [Xu Decai] waved his hand at him and kept his distance.
0:54:36|0:54:38|The woman seemed to have known it all along.
0:54:38|0:54:43|[Xu Decai] showed a disdainful expression.
0:54:43|0:54:54|The woman's eyes flickered, her lips tightly closed, and she pursed her mouth.
0:54:54|0:54:58|The woman's bangs fell slightly in front of her forehead, covering her eyes, making it impossible to tell what she was thinking.
0:55:0|0:55:5|The woman hung up the phone, showing a fierce expression, picked up her bag and walked out of the mall.
0:55:5|0:55:9|The camera cuts to a woman playing games on a tablet.
0:55:9|0:55:13|[Xu Decai] tilted his head back and drank a glass of white wine, then picked up his chopsticks to pick up some food.
0:55:13|0:55:17|The driver frowned at her, then looked helplessly outside the door.
0:55:21|0:55:24|[Xu Decai] is about to pour wine again, and the Driver's Alliance snatches the bottle.
0:56:19|0:56:26|He finished his drink in one gulp, immediately wrinkling his brow in response to the stimulation. He looked outside the shop, searching for the figure of [Xu Decai].
0:56:29|0:56:32|The driver stood up and walked to the door.
0:56:35|0:56:42|[Xu Decai] was pushed down by a man, got into the car, while the driver stood at the door with his hands on his hips, watching as [Xu Decai]'s car drove away.
0:56:51|0:57:0|[Xu Decai] reached out to open the car door, but Ah Qiang signaled to his henchman sitting next to him. The henchman quickly pulled out an iron chain, attempting to strangle [Xu Decai].
0:57:0|0:57:19|[Xu Decai] reacted quickly, immediately grabbing a hold of the iron chain with one hand and seizing the driver's hair with the other. The car on the road kept braking suddenly, and seeing this, [Xu Decai] opened the door to escape. However, Ah Qiang and his men also rushed out of the car and started beating up [Xu Decai]. The driver standing at the store entrance quickly ran over to help.
0:57:25|0:57:29|The driver takes [Xu Decai] and flees, the two of them running desperately in the alley.
0:57:29|0:57:37|Ah Qiang and a few others closely followed behind, running through the alley and onto the main street, where passersby stopped to watch.
0:57:47|0:57:59|Under the scorching sun, the two of them ran wildly, crossing the road, running over the pedestrian bridge. The people behind them still refused to give up, the driver panting heavily. They ran up the stairs, rushed through the ticket gate, and ran into the police station.
0:58:4|0:58:5|Xu Decai and Wang Xiaobing rushed into the zoo.
0:58:5|0:58:8|The speeding figure raced past the camels grazing by.
0:58:8|0:58:18|Ah Qiang and his men are also exhausted.
0:58:19|0:58:21|The two of them somersaulted through, passing by the giraffe enclosure.
0:58:21|0:58:23|The giraffe on the side turned its head to look at the group of people.
0:58:23|0:58:29|The old lady sheep, Xu Decai, who was grazing, also raised her head in surprise.
0:58:29|0:58:32|The two walked through the crowd taking photos, with [Xu Decai] following closely behind.
0:58:37|0:58:42|The two turned a corner and ran into a black bear head-on. [Wang Xiaobing] quickly turned around and ran out of the park.
0:58:42|0:58:50|The driver followed behind him, but unexpectedly knocked his leg against the door frame. The two of them ran to a pedestrian bridge.
0:58:50|0:58:59|Xu Decai saw several people continuing to run below.
0:58:59|0:59:5|The driver saw two voodoo dolls on the roadside, quickly picked one up and threw it at [Xu Decai], while holding the other one himself.
0:59:8|0:59:16|[Wang Xiaobing] watched the two swaggering dolls passing by without any suspicion.
0:59:16|0:59:27|The scene changes, at the dock, two people squat silently under a pillar, both shirtless with only vests on their upper bodies. The driver stands up and squats in front of [Xu Decai].
1:0:12|1:0:17|[Xu Decai] saw the money stuffed into his hand.
1:0:17|1:0:23|The driver was shocked and looked into the distance with his hands on his waist.
1:0:35|1:0:42|The driver licked the corner of his mouth, leaned against the road sign, smiled and looked towards the water in the distance, with rows of tall buildings standing on the opposite bank.
1:0:42|1:0:56|The scene cuts to a woman sitting angrily on the sofa, frowning and deep in thought.
1:0:56|1:1:1|On the other side, the woman angrily rolled her eyes, while [Xu Decai] looked pensive at the ground.
1:1:6|1:1:9|The woman walked towards the stalled car on the side of the road, carrying a handbag.
1:1:9|1:1:13|She opened the car door and got in, only to find [Xu Decai] sitting in the driver's seat.
1:1:15|1:1:17|The woman was startled and turned to leave.
1:1:17|1:1:23|Unexpectedly, the driver pushed her back into her seat from behind, and [Xu Decai] started the car and drove forward.
1:1:23|1:1:30|Xu Decai and Wang Xiaobing sat in the back seat, with Wang Xiaobing's hands and feet tied, his mouth taped shut, struggling to make muffled sounds.
1:1:39|1:1:45|The driver pushed Ah Qiang's head down, while the woman sat in the passenger seat, anxiously stealing glances at [Xu Decai] from the corner of her eye.
1:1:45|1:1:46|Coming up next.
1:2:8|1:2:24|[Wang Xiaobing] remained silent, looking at the wine glass on the table, and then she picked it up and drank it all in one gulp.
1:2:24|1:2:31|[Xu Decai] lowered his head and looked at the table, [Wang Xiaobing] finished drinking, got up, turned around to leave, but was grabbed by the wrist by [Xu Decai].
1:2:41|1:2:46|[Wang Xiaobing] shook off [Xu Decai]'s hand, [Xu Decai] looked at [Wang Xiaobing]'s departing figure with a desolate expression.
1:2:46|1:2:52|In the bathroom, [Wang Xiaobing] threw her bag aside and leaned weakly on the sink.
1:2:52|1:2:57|[Wang Xiaobing] looked at his exhausted self, panting heavily and unable to stop retching.
1:2:57|1:3:2|[Wang Xiaobing] turned on the tap and splashed some water on his face, slowly calming down.
1:3:2|1:3:5|[Wang Xiaobing] is unsteady on his feet, looking like he is about to faint.
1:3:5|1:3:9|[Wang Xiaobing] kept splashing water on his face and then looked up at the mirror.
1:3:10|1:3:13|He brushed aside the stray hairs on his forehead, his face covered in droplets of water. 
1:3:13|1:3:19|The woman then looked at herself in the mirror, her eyes gradually transitioning from confusion to determination. [Xu Decai]
1:3:19|1:3:24|He returned to his seat, at this moment, a waiter approached with two cocktails.
1:3:40|1:3:41|The two men remained silent.
1:4:6|1:4:16|The two men saw that the waiter showed no intention of leaving, so they stood up, picked up the straw from the wine glass, and each took a sip with vacant eyes. [Xu Decai] furrowed his brow tightly, his face serious.
1:4:16|1:4:23|The woman held her face in her hands, looking out the window with a troubled expression. Then, Xu Decai looked at the woman disappointedly.
1:5:9|1:5:14|[Xu Decai] raised his hand slightly, and the woman rolled her eyes disdainfully.
1:5:21|1:5:24|Zhao Bin turned his head and glared fiercely at [Xu Decai].
1:5:59|1:6:3|[Xu Decai] had tears in his eyes, he slowly closed his eyes, and tears streamed down his cheeks.
1:6:12|1:6:22|He stood up, picked up the red wine glass in front of him, raised it towards Zhao Bin, and then slowly poured the red wine into the porcelain plate next to him. Zhao Bin looked silently at [Xu Decai].
1:6:22|1:6:30|As the red wine splashed down, droplets flew and splattered onto the table, [Xu Decai] glared fiercely at Zhao Bin, allowing the wine to spill freely.
1:6:30|1:6:39|Zhao Bin looked at [Xu Decai] in astonishment, then glanced at the wine in the plate. [Xu Decai] slowly poured the wine into the plate, and the wine fell into it, splashing water droplets around.
1:6:40|1:6:42|The two of them looked at each other in silence.
1:6:42|1:6:50|Xu Decai slammed down the wine glass in his hand, glared angrily at Zhao Bin, and then decisively turned and walked away.
1:6:50|1:6:55|Zhao Bin stared at the back of [Xu Decai] as he walked away, Xu Decai walked faster and faster, and finally started to run.
1:6:58|1:7:4|[Xu Decai] rushed out of the coffee shop, startling the driver sitting at the door, who quickly stood up and looked around.
1:7:4|1:7:6|Zhao Bin stood up and looked towards the door.
1:7:11|1:7:23|As dusk fell, with the sun setting in the west, [Xu Decai] and the driver lay on the cement ground by the roadside, with several beer bottles scattered haphazardly between them.
1:7:23|1:7:27|The driver looked at [Xu Decai], and [Xu Decai] looked at the sky.
1:8:36|1:8:41|Ziji frowned and looked at [Xu Decai], who remained silent, then turned to the sky.
1:8:41|1:8:54|At night, various scenes in the city, neon lights of buildings light up one after another, the crossroads and bridges are bustling, the streets are brightly lit, still bustling.
1:8:54|1:9:4|The dim streetlights in the underground tunnel flickered as the car moved forward, with the lights passing one by one behind it, and the bustling traffic on the road surface was overwhelming.
1:9:6|1:9:12|The scene shifts, the mottled old wall covered with moss, ants crawling around without restraint.
1:9:12|1:9:19|Outside a glass house, filled with flowers, a weathered wooden board with the meaning of flowers written on it hangs above the door.
1:9:19|1:9:26|A woman is watering the flowers next to her with a spray bottle, gently caressing each flower.
1:9:26|1:9:31|The gentle breeze brushed by, causing the wind chimes by the window to sway lightly. She cautiously reached out and touched the scissors on the table.
1:9:33|1:9:40|The woman picked up the scissors and carefully trimmed the branches and leaves of the flowers, looking out the window along the clusters of flowers on the table.
1:9:40|1:9:43|A high school student came to the window.
1:10:30|1:10:38|On the other side, as the day broke, [Xu Decai] was still lying on the cement floor asleep, while his driver had long disappeared.
1:10:38|1:10:44|[Xu Decai] groggily sits up and looks around, reaching for a small piece of paper placed beside his head.
1:10:44|1:10:48|He unfolded the note, which was left by the driver for him.
1:10:48|1:10:49|The text above.
1:10:53|1:10:57|[Xu Decai] quickly got up, picked up the phone next to him, and hurriedly called the driver.
1:10:58|1:11:2|On the other side, the shirt is draped over the chair, and the phone rings.
1:11:8|1:11:11|Students come in and help take out their phones.
1:11:15|1:11:18|The woman took the phone, fumbling, and pressed the answer button.
1:11:47|1:11:52|[Xu Decai] leaned weakly against the railing, while on the other side, a truck was parked in front of the flower shop.
1:11:52|1:12:0|The driver got out of the car, walked into the store, lifted his vest to wipe the sweat off his face, and looked towards the room inside.
1:12:25|1:12:29|The woman happily smiled when she heard the driver was willing to stay for dinner.
1:12:29|1:12:38|She felt around for the tomatoes in the plate beside her, picked one up and placed it on the cutting board. She looked straight ahead and cautiously began to chop.
1:12:38|1:12:44|The driver walked down the stairs, when [Xu Decai] burst in and immediately threw a punch at the driver going up.
1:13:17|1:13:18|Xu Decai delivers another punch.
1:14:2|1:14:5|The driver stepped forward, grabbed [Xu Decai]'s collar, and pushed him against the wall.
1:14:35|1:14:42|Xu Decai slowly let go, releasing the driver's collar. The driver wiped away the tears from the corner of his eye and turned to look towards Yangshan.
1:14:53|1:15:0|The driver pushed Xu Decai, who staggered towards the wall, his eyes filled with shock.
1:15:0|1:15:10|Three people sat around a round table in the room. Yang Shan held a glass bottle in her right hand, touched a cup with her left hand, poured a glass of wine for the driver, and poured another glass for herself.
1:15:25|1:15:31|Yang Shan raised a toast to the driver, while [Xu Decai] silently watched the two of them. Yang Shan then poured another glass for [Xu Decai].
1:16:5|1:16:7|Yang Shan fumbled and picked up the chopsticks.
1:16:50|1:16:55|[Xu Decai] stared straight at Yangshan, while the driver kept his eyes down without saying a word.
1:17:3|1:17:9|The camera slowly moves up, revealing a pair of broken dance shoes hanging next to the dilapidated wooden staircase.
1:17:9|1:17:18|[Xu Decai] could no longer hold back, his lips trembling, silently lowering his head as if he was about to burst into tears the next second.
1:17:34|1:17:42|[Xu Decai] was in tears, crying uncontrollably, trembling as he held up the female convict in front of him and desperately tried to stuff something into her mouth.
1:17:42|1:17:50|[Xu Decai] trembled uncontrollably, struggling to chew the food in his mouth. Tears streamed down his face, filled with deep regret.
1:17:51|1:17:58|Yangshan across the way looked straight ahead, smiling, but tears were already welling up in his eyes.
1:17:58|1:18:2|In the fish tank on the side, several fish are leisurely swimming around.
1:18:2|1:18:9|Three people sat facing each other around a round table, with several small dishes on the table. None of them made any move to pick up their chopsticks.
1:18:9|1:18:13|Outside the window, dusk is approaching, the sky is misty and faint.
1:18:13|1:18:17|At this moment, a man pushed aside the door curtain and walked in.
1:18:50|1:18:57|[Xu Decai] looked up, turned around and looked around. On the other side, the workers began to move the furniture out of the flower shop.
1:19:1|1:19:5|Several workers directed the forklift to slowly stop in front of the flower shop.
1:19:5|1:19:19|[Xu Decai] walked towards the house and ran into the driver coming out.
1:19:19|1:19:20|The driver looked up at the roof and was startled.
1:19:36|1:19:39|[Ma Dongmei] stood on the rooftop, smiling and pointing towards the distance.
1:19:48|1:19:54|The workers downstairs heard the noise and gathered around, looking up at [Yang Shan] on the roof.
1:19:54|1:20:1|With the music gradually getting louder, [Xu Decai] gently sways his body, his head also slightly nodding along with the music.
1:20:2|1:20:8|His face was filled with a happy smile as he slowly raised his arms and danced gracefully to the music.
1:20:8|1:20:14|He had a small flower pinned behind his ear and was wearing a pair of small leather shoes with heels.
1:20:14|1:20:19|As the action unfolds, his hands and legs tremble involuntarily. 
1:20:19|1:20:23|Nevertheless, [Wang Xiaobing] continued to dance confidently.
1:20:23|1:20:28|Surrounded by flowers, her graceful and elegant figure resembles a swan gliding on calm waters during the day.
1:20:30|1:20:36|The workers gathered downstairs were all attracted, staring intently at the materials on the roof.
1:20:36|1:20:52|In the dilapidated tin-roofed surroundings, [Xu Decai] had a determined look in his eyes. His initial movements seemed like bending down, yet also like looking up, like coming and going, so calm and unhurried, yet so full of melancholy, difficult to be depicted in words.
1:20:54|1:21:3|He kept jumping, seemingly without any intention of stopping, his dance moves resembling flying, walking, standing, and leaning at the same time.
1:21:3|1:21:17|The casual movements are never lacking in strength, the floral pleated skirt on the body dances in the wind, the slender arms coordinate with the movements of the hands, weaving in and out in a continuous flow, the twisting body and the merging of hands and feet.
1:21:19|1:21:23|[Xu Decai] also stood in the crowd, smiling as he looked towards Yangshan.
1:21:23|1:21:27|Xu Decai dances in the sun, spinning happily under the flower trellis.
1:21:27|1:21:31|The music ends, Yangshan strikes a final pose.
1:21:31|1:21:37|He opened his arms, looked up at the sky, and the workers spontaneously applauded.
1:21:37|1:21:42|[Xu Decai] shielded the sun with his hand, smiled at Yangshan, and then turned to look at the workers beside him.
1:21:44|1:21:58|The workers behind immediately turned around, turned off the radio in the car, and [Xu Decai] looked thoughtfully at the rooftop. At this moment, the driver brought Yang Shan down from the roof.
1:22:1|1:22:5|The workers were about to move things forward when they were stopped by [Xu Decai] raising his hand.
1:22:5|1:22:11|Yang Shan stood in front of the flower shop, slowly stroking the door curtain and caressing the flowers hanging by the door.
1:22:11|1:22:18|[Xu Decai] stared at Yang Shan intently, while Yang Shan showed a reluctant expression.
1:22:18|1:22:22|Yang Shan's eyes were red, and he silently walked towards the outside of the building.
1:22:22|1:22:27|The driver greeted the workers, who then proceeded to demolish the building one after another.
1:22:28|1:22:46|One by one, people passed by [Xu Decai], who was standing in front of a building about to be demolished. Behind him, a giant poster slowly unfolded, showing a resolute half-body portrait of [Xu Decai] with his arms crossed in front of his chest, looking down with a piercing gaze as the wind blew.
1:22:46|1:22:53|Above him, there were several big words shining brightly, saying "Follow the law of the jungle, omnipotent and worry-free".
1:22:53|1:22:58|[Xu Decai] looked up, chuckled self-deprecatingly, and walked away.
1:22:58|1:23:3|Workers swung hammers to remove the already dilapidated window frames, while an excavator pushed aside the small shed on the roof.
1:23:4|1:23:18|Broken glass and wood debris scattered on the ground, looking inside the doorway, the furniture has long been removed, leaving only empty rooms. The rooms are decorated with floral wallpaper, and each door frame is adorned with carefully crafted door curtains.
1:23:18|1:23:28|The wooden staircase on the side seems to have been repainted, spotless, with only a small flower-shaped hook left on it, while the dance shoes that were originally hanging on it are nowhere to be seen.
1:23:28|1:23:33|The scene cuts to the driver waiting by the side of the road in a truck, and [Xu Decai] opens the door and gets in.
1:23:50|1:24:5|[Xu Decai] nodded towards the front, and the driver slowly drove forward. At that moment, a message came on the phone, and [Xu Decai] opened it to play the voice message.
1:24:22|1:24:27|[Xu Decai] put down his phone, looked up and let out a long sigh, leaning weakly against the back of the seat.
1:24:59|1:25:7|Driver Zhongmei looked at [Xu Decai], seeing the determined look in his eyes and his resolute intention. She could only silently start the car and drive forward.
1:25:7|1:25:17|The two drove out of the village, through the city center, over the bridge, and onto the highway. Along the way, [Xu Decai] remained silent, with tightly closed lips, staring straight ahead.
1:25:17|1:25:24|The driver had a worried look on his face, occasionally glancing at [Xu Decai] with a face full of concern. [Xu Decai] looked ashen-faced, with narrowed eyes.
1:25:26|1:25:32|He closed his eyes, looked out the window, and silently sorted out his emotions.
1:25:32|1:25:36|Outside the window, the autumn air is crisp, and the leaves have already taken on the appearance of autumn.
1:25:36|1:25:42|On the highway, the traffic is constant, and looking up, a plane is taking off in the distance.
1:25:42|1:25:47|In the car, the small flower decoration on the front passenger seat swayed gently.
1:25:47|1:25:51|As dusk fell, the driver and [Xu Decai] gradually drove towards the airport.
1:26:25|1:26:30|The driver looked at [Xu Decai], who raised his eyebrows at the driver and decisively turned away.
1:26:31|1:26:41|The driver looked at the reflection of Xu Decai's back in the rearview mirror, as if he was about to cry, until Xu Decai's figure gradually disappeared and was never seen again.
1:26:41|1:26:49|Driver Decai pursed his lips, turned around, looked into the distance absentmindedly, then lowered his head and started the car to drive away.
1:26:49|1:26:59|Next, [Xu Decai] stood by the highway, took out two cigarettes and lit them. He took one cigarette from his mouth, faced towards the sky, raised the cigarettes with both hands, and bowed.
1:27:3|1:27:18|[Xu Decai] looked solemnly into the distance, then placed the cigarette on the roadside barrier. He stared at the cigarette thoughtfully for a while, glanced at the sky, as if making a firm decision, turned around and walked away, leaving the cigarette to burn alone.
1:27:21|1:27:33|The tailwind blows, the cigarette burns slowly, the ash falls, the smoke rises in wisps, two lonely cigarettes lean on each other, burning together, heading towards the end of life.
1:28:3|1:28:6|The landlady called for someone and then sat down again.
1:28:6|1:28:12|The driver glanced at the kitchen, sighed, and sat down at the round table at the beginning.
1:28:12|1:28:17|Cuihua impatiently drops a bowl of beef noodles and leaves, curling her fingers.
1:28:17|1:28:22|The driver, Xu Decai, didn't show much emotion, just silently staring at the door in front of him.
1:28:22|1:28:26|At this moment, the few men who had fought with them before have returned to the restaurant.
1:29:13|1:29:16|A henchman quickly brought the box over and handed it to the driver.
1:29:33|1:29:38|The driver quickly put the boxes into the car and prepared to leave.
1:29:58|1:30:2|The leader man waved his hand towards the direction of the driver and sighed.
1:30:2|1:30:6|The driver was driving while anxiously making a phone call.
1:30:10|1:30:17|Seeing that Xu Decai's phone was unreachable, the driver anxiously changed lanes and stepped on the gas pedal, driving forward aggressively.
1:30:17|1:30:24|The exhaust pipe of the van was emitting thick smoke, speeding up on the highway, overtaking car after car.
1:30:24|1:30:29|The license plate of the truck was already worn out, with signs of wear around the front.
1:30:29|1:30:35|The driver, anxious at the moment, had already disregarded many things and just wanted to catch up with [Xu Decai] as quickly as possible.
1:30:37|1:30:52|The truck raced forward recklessly, driving to the spot where it dropped off [Xu Decai] just now. He jumped out of the truck, ran to the side of the road, anxiously searching around.
1:30:52|1:30:59|At this point, no one responded to the driver's words. The driver hesitated and looked towards the direction of the airport, then turned around to search behind him.
1:31:4|1:31:7|The driver stood on the roadside, looking around helplessly.
1:31:7|1:31:11|He supported his waist with one hand, and sweat had already soaked through his vest.
1:31:11|1:31:16|The driver looked down and saw the two cigarettes left by [Xu Decai].
1:31:16|1:31:19|Reaching out and picking it up, the cigarette had already burned out.
1:31:19|1:31:25|At this moment, the phone rang, and the driver took out his phone from his pocket and answered it by the roadside.
1:32:25|1:32:29|Upon hearing [Xu Decai]'s words, the body trembled slightly.
1:32:29|1:32:33|He turned his head to the side, his eyes turning red, as if about to smoke.
1:32:33|1:32:38|He looked around, his lips tightly pressed together, walked towards the truck, and continued on the journey.
1:32:45|1:32:50|The truck is driving on the highway, with [Xu Decai] at the wheel, his face full of sorrow and melancholy.
1:32:50|1:32:57|He took a deep breath, trying to adjust his emotions, but it seemed that he found this method ineffective.
1:32:57|1:33:6|He sighed deeply again, lowered his head to shift gears, slowly parked the car on the side of the road, took out a cigarette from his pocket, lit it, and put it to his lips.
1:33:6|1:33:9|He took a deep drag, and his shoulders slowly sank.
1:33:26|1:33:42|[Driver] He closed his eyes and then opened them, looking ahead with a lost expression. It seemed like he remembered something, and his calm demeanor was slowly replaced by agitation. His eyes started to turn red, and at that moment, he couldn't hold back anymore. Tears streamed down his face.
1:33:42|1:33:51|[Xu Decai] held a cigarette in one hand against his forehead, while the other hand covered his mouth and nose. Tears streamed down his face as he bit his hand in agony, trying to stifle his sobs.
1:33:54|1:34:1|The camera cuts to [Xu Decai]'s truck continuing on the road, driving towards the distance.
