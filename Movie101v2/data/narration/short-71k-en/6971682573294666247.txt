0:2:59|0:3:2|[Geng Hao] takes off his goggles and throws them on the table, picks up a cigarette from the side, lights it in his mouth.
0:3:2|0:3:10|On his bare forearm, the words "Quit Smoking" were neatly tattooed, [Geng Hao] sighed and picked up a pen, leaning it against the table.
0:3:29|0:3:36|The man awkwardly pointed at the furnishings inside the room as he spoke.
0:3:56|0:4:4|[Geng Hao] dodges the man trying to take the agreement document.
0:4:19|0:4:38|The man finished speaking, raised his head and left the room on tiptoe. The clever little dog by the bed imitated the man's slight swaying waist as it walked. After the man left, [Geng Hao] angrily crumpled the contract and threw it out, staring at the paper ball that the dog brought back.
0:4:38|0:4:46|[Geng Hao] is breathing heavily, the scene cuts to outside an apartment building, where the damp ground is littered with countless cigarette butts.
0:4:46|0:4:51|[Geng Hao] leaned against the railing, clutching a bottle of wine and swallowing continuously.
0:4:51|0:4:54|The car behind him caught his attention, so he turned back to check.
0:4:54|0:4:59|After getting a clear look at the people in the car, [Geng Hao] turned his head and took a few deep drags of his cigarette.
0:5:0|0:5:7|He looked at the man getting out of the car again, only to see the man tall and straight, locking the car and walking towards the apartment next to [Geng Hao].
0:5:7|0:5:13|[Geng Hao] pursed his lips, picked up the cigarette in his hand, and walked towards the apartment door at the end of the railing.
0:5:13|0:5:19|He had a hammer hanging from his belt, glinting coldly under the street lamp.
0:5:19|0:5:25|[Geng Hao] pulled out a hammer and hid it behind his back, slowly moving forward along the railing.
0:5:25|0:5:30|He followed closely behind the man and then remembered to put on his winter hat.
0:5:30|0:5:38|Just as he raised the hammer to make a move, the man suddenly turned around, and [Geng Hao] quickly put away the hammer.
0:5:45|0:5:54|He had a hammer in his pocket, but took out a lighter from his pants pocket, reached out his hand, walked over, and stood in front of the man, [Geng Hao]'s outstretched hand froze in mid-air.
0:5:54|0:6:0|The man seemed accustomed to being lit by others, he leaned his head slightly towards the lighter, and [Geng Hao] lit his cigarette with a dark face.
0:6:2|0:6:7|After several attempts, the flame finally burst out after the valve was turned up.
0:6:10|0:6:17|[Geng Hao] struggled to open his mouth, but ultimately lacked the courage to speak. His arm holding the lighter drooped weakly.
0:6:19|0:6:42|After a long sigh, the hammer also fell to the ground. Needless to say, the man just now is the third party in Geng Hao's marriage. By chance, he caught a glimpse of the convenience store clerk across the street recording him with a phone. Geng Hao was momentarily unsure whether to regret or to carry on. The scene shifts to the hospital lobby.
0:6:42|0:6:50|[Geng Hao] was violently vomiting, burying his head in the gap of the corridor, while his friend [Hao Yi] took photos of him.
0:7:6|0:7:12|[Hao Yi] sat down on the corridor bench, his eyes flickering as he watched the nurse place her hand in his lap.
0:7:50|0:7:55|[Hao Yi] was stunned watching [Geng Hao] crazily tearing into the pig's trotters.
0:8:4|0:8:9|After a powerless outburst, the hall was left in a mess.
0:8:9|0:8:16|[Geng Hao] was sobbing in [Hao Yi]'s arms.
0:8:17|0:8:23|Alcohol guides his sorrow to vent out.
0:8:24|0:8:33|At this moment, he had greasy hair and a strong smell of alcohol emanating from his body. The layers of wrinkles around his eyes and jaw almost spelled out the word "pain" on his face.
0:10:29|0:10:37|[Geng Hao] took a few steps forward with the juice, while [Hao Yi] fumbled in his pocket and handed the phone to [Geng Hao].
0:10:57|0:11:2|In the phone recording, what [Kang Xiaoyu] said made [Geng Hao] feel a little resentful and also a little heartbroken.
0:11:2|0:11:11|He stared at [Hao Yi] for a long time, then walked towards the van parked halfway. [Hao Yi] played with the condom in his hand, looking mischievously at [Geng Hao] as he walked past.
0:11:29|0:11:39|The two then started the car and quickly drove towards the girls 3000 kilometers away. The wheels turned, and Juice stood in the arms of [Geng Hao], sticking her little head out of the window, curiously looking around.
0:11:39|0:11:44|The vehicle was speeding along, the strong wind stirring the two ears of [Geng Hao] like flapping juice.
0:11:46|0:11:53|[Hao Yi] had a U-shaped pillow around his neck, wearing a cowboy felt hat. He held the steering wheel with one hand and fed himself dessert with the other, looking very content.
0:11:53|0:12:0|Turning to the passenger seat, [Geng Hao] had his arm resting on the car window, hand supporting his head, looking completely bored.
0:12:0|0:12:7|As the continuous flow of vehicles passed by, five years ago, outside a hotel, Kang Xiaoyu was dressed in a palace maid outfit.
0:12:7|0:12:15|She hurriedly ran from the taxi to the lobby, pushed open the doors of the banquet hall, and rushed in.
0:12:42|0:12:46|Her slender body crashed through the door and fell in front of the guests.
0:14:36|0:14:44|The noisy applause was gradually replaced by the sound of water, as the water pipe in the solitary room's bathroom was gushing water, with [Kang Xiaoyu] wearing a shower cap.
0:15:4|0:15:15|[Kang Xiaoyu] was attracted by the lyrics, slowly raised her head, and looked at the screen brightly. It was a song called "Going to Dali" by [Geng Hao].
0:15:35|0:15:41|Tears rolled down her cheeks unconsciously, and [Kang Xiaoyu] wiped them away with a self-deprecating smile.
0:15:43|0:15:50|She put down the cup in her hand and typed on the computer, asking if this song can be downloaded. The space blogger replied with just one sentence, "It can only be streamed."
0:16:6|0:16:12|Kang Xiaoyu picked up the phone amidst the singing.
0:16:12|0:16:18|The scene returns to the car driven by [Hao Yi].
0:16:18|0:16:22|The car TV is playing a music video of [Geng Hao],
0:17:59|0:18:8|[Kang Xiaoyu] stood outside Dali City taking a photo with Zhu Bajie. After that, [Kang Xiaoyu] walked straight towards Dali, completely forgetting that she was still holding a rake in her hand.
0:18:10|0:18:12|She returned it to the staff with a mixture of tears and laughter.
0:18:12|0:18:18|Strolling along the bustling ancient town alley, away from the hustle and bustle of the city.
0:18:18|0:18:23|[Kang Xiaoyu] let go of all worries and looked at everything in Dali with childlike innocence and joy.
0:18:24|0:18:30|Violently smiling at the singing friend, avoiding the kissing couple beside her, she walked to the city wall.
0:18:30|0:18:36|Took a photo and bounced away.
0:22:53|0:22:59|After all the effort put in by [Geng Hao] went to waste, [Hao Yi] felt it was a pity. Feeling a bit annoyed, he pursed his lips and stood up, saying to [Geng Hao].
0:23:48|0:23:56|Thinking that his attempt to charm [Hao Yi] had failed, [Geng Hao] had a big appetite and said to the barbecue boss.
0:24:7|0:24:15|The girl looked at [Hao Yi] with tears in her eyes, feeling that she had let her guard down. [Hao Yi] sat next to her with a bottle of wine in his hand.
0:24:49|0:24:56|After [Hao Yi] finished speaking, he stood up and the girl followed him awkwardly towards the direction of the van, watching [Hao Yi] boast to himself as they walked, leaving [Geng Hao] feeling deeply hurt.
0:24:56|0:25:1|[Hao Yi] said to be careful, but his hand smoothly slid onto the girl's slender waist.
0:25:3|0:25:9|[Geng Hao] was very dissatisfied and wanted to prove himself. He looked around for a target, and finally his gaze fell on a female artist next to him who was eating skewers.
0:25:13|0:25:17|The female artist's prop tail was trapped under the chair, and [Geng Hao] decided to play a trick on her, so he walked towards her.
0:25:17|0:25:21|He clumsily used his foot to hook the tail of the female artist.
0:26:28|0:26:35|The scene cuts back to [Kang Xiaoyu], who sits down outside a beverage shop to take a break. She lowers her head and sees a thin and weak little dog whimpering.
0:26:35|0:26:47|She looked around, searching for the owner of the little dog. Then she bent down and asked, the dog was dirty, with a few strings of candied haws stuck to its body. It seemed to be a stray dog. [Kang Xiaoyu] squatted down.
0:26:47|0:26:50|Carefully lifting up the puppy.
0:26:52|0:26:55|A mournful cry made Kang Xiaoyu feel distressed.
0:26:55|0:27:2|So she arrived at the Wutong Inn carrying a small dog.
0:27:24|0:27:32|After saying that, she happily ran up the stairs with her little dog, the sunlight sprinkling on her, adding a touch of radiance and vitality to her whole being.
0:27:39|0:27:46|Overlooking the Cangshan Mountains and Erhai Lake, [Kang Xiaoyu] couldn't help but exclaim, holding a small dog and spinning around excitedly.
0:28:22|0:28:25|[Hao Yi] took the card and quickly left.
0:28:52|0:28:57|Taking the perfume thrown by [Hao Yi], [Geng Hao] sprayed it randomly twice and walked to the other side of the road.
0:28:57|0:29:6|It was a barber shop called Paris at Night, located in Furong Town, just as ancient as Furong Town. The signboard showed signs of weathering and aging.
0:29:26|0:29:32|Upon hearing Geng Hao's response, a hint of pain and resentment appeared on the girl's face, her mouth turned downwards as she softly sobbed.
0:29:42|0:29:49|Following the girl's gaze, [Geng Hao] noticed that two flies were circling around a dead goldfish on the table. He pointed at the goldfish and said.
0:30:7|0:30:13|[Geng Hao] was a bit puzzled to see the girl sitting on the sofa crying.
0:30:22|0:30:30|[Geng Hao] sat somewhat awkwardly at the other end of the sofa away from the girl, but she gestured for him to come closer and sit next to her.
0:30:31|0:30:39|[Geng Hao] had never seen such a posture before. He sniffed and lifted his butt to move closer. The girl then seized the opportunity to hug his arm and cried on his shoulder.
0:30:40|0:30:48|[Geng Hao] felt a bit uncomfortable and worried, so he pulled his own arm out.
0:30:51|0:30:57|The girl suddenly became serious, as if she had never cried before, and she crossed her arms leaning on the sofa.
0:30:59|0:31:4|[Geng Hao] finds it quite amusing.
0:31:6|0:31:16|The girl turned her head and stared at him for a while, then she put her feet down from the coffee table and stood up, glaring at [Geng Hao]. With a determined look, she walked aggressively to the counter and pulled open a drawer.
0:33:28|0:33:36|The girl walked up to [Geng Hao] with some excitement, then she trotted upstairs to prepare the tools needed to pierce her ears.
0:34:18|0:34:26|The two saw a girl laughing lightly as she walked towards them in front of the barbershop. The girl shook her head and took out two props from her back pocket, putting them on her ears.
0:34:26|0:34:32|Playfully looking at [Hao Yi], Geng Hao widened his eyes in surprise as he gazed at the girl who looked charming without makeup.
0:34:32|0:34:38|The girl stuck out her tongue.
0:34:39|0:34:45|The girl turned her head and raised her chin towards the electric bike behind her.
0:35:0|0:35:7|After saying that, [Hao Yi] left [Geng Hao] and took the girl across the street.
0:35:12|0:35:17|[Geng Hao] watched the two people on the opposite side of the road laughing and sticking together, feeling angry, he walked back to the barbershop.
0:35:17|0:35:24|After getting his ear pierced, Geng Hao followed the girl to the second floor room.
0:36:46|0:36:48|The girl is riding on [Geng Hao].
0:36:48|0:36:57|Just as she reached out her pinky finger to ask for a promise, the door rang, and the two quickly separated.
0:37:14|0:37:21|After saying there was no movement outside for the time being, [Geng Hao] threw the jeans to the girl in the room.
0:37:22|0:37:29|The girl who was still showing her legs, somewhat embarrassedly put on jeans. Just when they both thought it was safe, shouts came from outside the door.
0:38:5|0:38:10|Li Maomao lit Geng Hao's shoes on fire.
0:38:15|0:38:21|After Geng Hao finished speaking, he became angry and stormed out, twisting the door open. The girl could only helplessly follow.
0:38:22|0:38:29|Li Maomao dropped the flaming shoe in her hand, picked up a nearby wooden stick, and [Geng Hao] quickly extinguished the fire on the shoe.
0:40:21|0:40:26|Thinking of his own despicable behavior in front of Li Maomao, he sat helplessly in the chair.
0:40:26|0:40:33|Upon careful consideration, he is not as good as Li Maomao. He even lit a cigarette for the mistress. The girl's uncle walked in with takeout and a chicken.
0:40:36|0:40:41|Uncle looked at the messy courtyard and asked, [Geng Hao] was too lazy and inconvenient to explain to him, so he casually replied.
0:40:42|0:40:50|The scene shifts to him dragging a half-burned broken shoe, carrying clothes and wearing a flashy earring, walking past a group of square dancing middle-aged women.
0:40:50|0:40:57|He wandered aimlessly down the street with his mouth half open, but looked up to see [Hao Yi]'s van parked not far away.
0:41:33|0:41:37|The scene shifts back to [Kang Xiaoyu], who is lying on the bed in the inn.
0:41:37|0:41:46|Examining the men's information on the marriage registration website with a laptop, Geng Hao searched for a long time and finally found one that was passable.
0:41:46|0:41:55|From the photo, the person is a young artistic man who plays music, which suits her taste. After thinking for a while, [Kang Xiaoyu] took out her phone and dialed the man's number.
0:41:55|0:42:1|The signal in the room seemed to be poor, so she had to hold up her phone and run around the house.
0:42:26|0:42:31|Kang Xiaoyu was stunned by the man's words, she could only awkwardly pretend to be a tenant looking for a rental, and hung up the phone disappointedly.
0:42:31|0:42:35|She glanced at the lively theme bar outside the window and decided to go downstairs to relax.
0:42:35|0:42:41|Tossing away the bad mood just now, [Kang Xiaoyu] bounced down the stairs and ran onto the corridor.
0:42:41|0:42:50|The tranquility of the inn is a stark contrast to the bustling theme bar outside, where famous tourists gather in small groups both inside and outside the bar.
0:42:50|0:42:54|[Kang Xiaoyu] walked around the courtyard of the bar, where numerous young men and women crisscrossed in every gap of the courtyard.
0:43:3|0:43:8|Others either turned a blind eye to the situation, considering it commonplace, or were influenced by the chaotic atmosphere.
0:43:8|0:43:16|[Kang Xiaoyu] dodges the intoxicated men and women while wandering around the courtyard, when a man calls out to her.
0:43:28|0:43:32|He then walked up to the bar and sat down, saying to the [Innkeeper].
0:43:34|0:43:41|The innkeeper gestured OK to the man outside the door and then pushed a cocktail in front of Kang Xiaoyu.
0:43:43|0:43:51|Kang Xiaoyu glanced at the man and rolled her eyes, then turned to the Innkeeper and said.
0:44:8|0:44:15|The man outside the door moved a chair and sat across from [Kang Xiaoyu].
0:44:33|0:44:42|The man smirked and gave a thumbs-up to the Innkeeper, Kang Xiaoyu didn't want to get involved too much, picked up the glass and drank it all by herself.
0:44:57|0:45:4|Five years later, in the inn on the right bank, the sky was just getting light.
0:45:21|0:45:28|The two of them left the inn and returned to the car while talking.
0:46:23|0:46:28|The steering wheel lost control, in a moment of urgency, [Hao Yi] slammed on the brakes, and the vehicle swerved to a stop at the side of the road.
0:46:28|0:46:33|The prop rifle with a bayonet in the back seat directly pierced through the multifunctional panel between the two.
0:46:33|0:46:42|The strange stone also hit the trunk and fell in the middle of the road.
0:47:53|0:48:2|When the two were confronting each other and complaining, a small car drove straight into the strange rocks in the middle of the road, lifting the chassis and scraping the ground all the way, then abruptly stopped at the roadside.
0:48:2|0:48:12|The argument between the two was interrupted by a sudden car accident. [Hao Yi] was holding a crescent moon blade, while [Geng Hao] was holding a couple's fan. They awkwardly walked towards the vehicle involved in the accident.
0:48:12|0:48:18|A tall figure emerged from the vehicle as it opened, catching the attention of two people nearby.
0:48:26|0:48:31|The person getting off the car was dressed in a plain-colored Western-style suit with a two-finger-wide cowhide belt tied around the waist.
0:48:45|0:48:52|The woman used her personal anti-wolf spray to knock down [Hao Yi], then sprayed wildly at [Geng Hao]'s face.
0:48:53|0:49:2|The once quiet mountain road was now filled with the shouts of the two brothers echoing back and forth.
0:49:2|0:49:11|After some time, Geng Hao, Hao Yi, and Kang Xiaoyu cleared up the misunderstanding and began to inspect the car.
0:49:30|0:49:35|[Geng Hao], carrying luggage and holding a juice box, finally calmed down. He stood by the roadside for a while, then awkwardly walked back to the car.
0:49:49|0:49:53|[Hao Yi] hands the trailer rope to [Geng Hao] and continues to flirt with the woman.
0:50:44|0:50:51|The closing window trapped [Hao Yi]'s fingers, causing him to quickly retract his arm from the car body, standing awkwardly in place.
0:50:51|0:50:57|Three people and two cars began to roam on the winding mountain roads, with [Geng Hao] asking the woman.
0:51:28|0:51:34|[Geng Hao] took off the shiny earring and threw it out of the window.
0:51:54|0:51:59|The woman finished speaking, turned to the side, sneered, and winked. [Zhou Lijuan] lightly smiled charmingly.
0:51:59|0:52:4|Just as [Geng Hao] was suddenly moved, the phone vibrated, and he took out his mobile phone to answer the call.
0:52:21|0:52:39|Hao Yi's attitude is truly excellent. After venting, he raised his phone, hugged a tree branch, and took a selfie with a big smile.
0:53:21|0:53:27|The car came to a slow stop.
0:54:0|0:54:11|The vehicle slid closer to [Hao Yi], who was wearing headphones and couldn't hear any noise outside, while [Geng Hao] was pulling the trailer rope.
0:54:15|0:54:21|Two cars collided and came to a stop by the stone bridge.
0:54:22|0:54:26|[Hao Yi] leaned out of the car window, still in shock.
0:54:31|0:54:37|Just as the words fell, the van he was in staggered and slid towards the bridge, almost falling into the valley below.
0:54:37|0:54:49|When the car stabilized, [Hao Yi] used both hands and feet to quickly climb out.
0:54:56|0:55:1|The woman's concern made [Geng Hao] feel warmth for the first time in this twisty journey.
0:55:1|0:55:4|He looked at the woman with a bit of distraction.
0:55:10|0:55:17|Upon hearing Geng Hao's vague response, Hao Yi felt jealous and twisted his neck to ask.
0:57:8|0:57:16|She found the disc case and pulled it out from the bottom.
0:57:35|0:57:39|The Innkeeper awkwardly put on his cap and said.
0:57:40|0:57:46|[Kang Xiaoyu] walked out of the inn with a stack of DVDs, and the innkeeper struck up a conversation.
0:58:5|0:58:12|[Hao Yi] snatched the prop gun from the child's hand.
0:58:13|0:58:25|This is a repair shop in the mountains, where [Geng Hao] and two others are taking a break.
0:58:38|0:58:44|The woman spoke as she held an egg in her hand and extended her arm to place it on Geng Hao's swollen eye, gently moving it.
0:58:46|0:58:52|The woman interrupted [Geng Hao], one hand supporting his chin, the other lightly pressing a rolling egg on his face.
0:58:52|0:58:57|The warm eggs and the icy hands of [Geng Hao] made him close his mouth in ecstasy.
0:58:57|0:59:3|Upon seeing this scene, [Hao Yi] became anxious and quickly took out his phone to make a call.
1:0:8|1:0:15|[Hao Yi] stirs the instant noodles and asks [Geng Hao].
1:1:3|1:1:12|After some adjustments, the three men and a dog embarked on the journey again, with the woman driving an electric tricycle carrying Geng Hao and Hao Yi, shuttling through the rolling hills.
1:1:12|1:1:16|The lush mountains, with clouds swirling in the sky like waves on the sea.
1:1:16|1:1:27|They roam freely on the rural paths of Dali, taking turns driving, transitioning from overcast skies to clear blue skies, and wandering from the mountains to the shores of Erhai Lake.
1:1:27|1:1:30|The scenery along the way was picturesque with lush pear trees and green onions, and the water and sky were of the same color.
1:1:30|1:1:42|[Geng Hao] and the woman sat side by side on a tricycle, the wind beside them lifting the woman's hair, the bright sun shining on her face, she seemed to exude a fantastic and beautiful glow all over her body.
1:1:42|1:1:49|At this moment, [Geng Hao] seemed to have let go of his worries, holding up a glass of juice and enjoying the picturesque scenery around him.
1:1:49|1:1:59|The reflections of three people riding electric bikes on a small path by the lake slowly merged into the water, with sunlight piercing through the clouds, casting a radiant glow that intertwined in the distant horizon where water and sky met.
1:1:59|1:2:7|Having enjoyed a relaxed and joyful journey all the way, the three finally arrived at the airport. [Geng Hao] and [Hao Yi] stood outside the departure hall, looking at the woman across from them.
1:3:24|1:3:32|So [Geng Hao] set down the juice in his arms, put the anti-wolf spray back in his pocket, and then took out his phone, bowing his head to fiddle with the screen.
1:3:32|1:3:37|There was no longer the previous ease and joy on his face, instead, a hint of seriousness and conflict appeared.
1:3:37|1:3:45|The phone screen displays numerous missed calls from [Kang Xiaoyu], while [Geng Hao] still has "wife" as her contact name.
1:3:45|1:3:53|After hesitating for a while with a blank look in his eyes, Geng Hao finally made a decision and dialed the phone number with a gentle smile.
1:4:54|1:4:57|On the phone, [Kang Xiaoyu] remained silent at this end.
1:6:12|1:6:24|Without waiting for [Kang Xiaoyu] to finish speaking, [Geng Hao] hung up the phone directly. He looked down at the screen of his phone, where the word "wife" was displayed, finally realizing that [Kang Xiaoyu] on the other end of the line no longer belonged to him.
1:6:24|1:6:32|The decoration of the departure hall at the airport is quite magnificent, but the dim lights shining on [Geng Hao] at this moment make him appear so lonely and vulnerable.
1:6:32|1:6:41|He stared at the phone screen, wiping away tears from time to time, suppressing himself from crying out loud. [Hao Yi] who came from behind with a dog crate, saw everything.
1:6:41|1:6:45|Watching [Geng Hao] and [Hao Yi] wiping away tears secretly, they felt uneasy in their hearts.
1:7:0|1:7:3|Upon seeing [Hao Yi], [Geng Hao] quickly adjusted his emotions, turned his back and wiped away his tears.
1:7:5|1:7:10|Facing the unavoidable [Hao Yi] who approached, [Geng Hao] forced himself to speak up.
1:7:26|1:7:31|The conversation between the two temporarily freed [Geng Hao] from pain and numbness, and he continued speaking.
1:8:11|1:8:17|In the lobby, [Hao Yi] cleared the way for [Geng Hao] and casually picked up a pot of green plants from the counter, stuffing it into his arms.
1:8:17|1:8:23|The two of them walked out of the hall and looked around for a while, seeing a woman and her friends chatting not far away.
1:8:24|1:8:35|Under the dual influence of frustration and impulse, [Geng Hao] held flowers and walked quickly towards the woman. The words of love were on the tip of his tongue, but they were interrupted by a scene in front of them.
1:8:35|1:8:44|The woman locked her friend in the corner with her arm, gently stroking her friend's cheek, while her friend's hand wandered around the woman's slender waist.
1:8:44|1:8:52|Beside him, [Geng Hao] stood still holding a plant, unaware that the pot had fallen from his hand.
1:8:54|1:9:0|[Hao Yi]'s voice brought [Geng Hao] back to reality. He looked at the twitching face of the green plant and said fiercely.
1:10:19|1:10:25|He walked out of the bar, shaking his phone, and approached [Kang Xiaoyu].
1:10:32|1:10:38|The boss walked towards the middle of the courtyard while talking to himself, and he walked to a table near the stage.
1:10:48|1:10:55|[Kang Xiaoyu] was feeling a bit agitated, with the sound system occasionally blasting cries filled with passion and desire.
1:11:0|1:11:6|The atmosphere here made her feel disgusted and uncomfortable, so she walked straight to the stage and snatched the microphone from the host's hand.
1:11:49|1:11:56|With dizzying lights, deafening music, alcohol, and numerous beautiful women to numb himself, he tried to drive away his frustrations.
1:11:56|1:12:6|In the ambiguous and wild dance floor, those youthful and beautiful bodies are drenched in beer and champagne, crazily swaying to the rhythm of the music.
1:12:6|1:12:17|The loud music drowned out everyone's voices, as they drank and reveled, mouths moving but unable to hear each other's words, like mute people. They were like strangers unable to see each other's true preferences.
1:12:25|1:12:27|Drowning his suppressed past in alcohol, deceiving himself with the past, there is no more heartache at this moment.
1:12:29|1:12:37|The two are immersed in the madness of tonight, reveling in the debauchery, and the scene shifts back to Kang Xiaoyu.
1:12:51|1:12:58|After listening to the words of the bar owner, [Kang Xiaoyu] chuckled in anger, no longer entangled, and directly picked up the phone placed on the table by the bar owner.
1:13:0|1:13:6|The innkeeper squinted at Kang Xiaoyu.
1:13:8|1:13:15|He didn't expect that [Kang Xiaoyu] would actually throw the phone into the Erhai Lake and run away together.
1:13:15|1:13:19|[Kang Xiaoyu] calmed down and watched as the [Innkeeper] searched for his phone without saying a word.
1:13:33|1:13:38|[Geng Hao] took out 200 yuan from his wallet and said to the hostess across the table.
1:13:43|1:13:51|The hostess taunted, preparing to open the bead curtain to the bathroom, [Geng Hao] swayed as he sat up from the bed, extending his arm and sticking out his tongue.
1:13:54|1:14:1|[Geng Hao] sat down at the mahjong table, accompanying the hostess as she carefully asked the [Geng Hao] sitting on the bench next to the bathtub behind the bead curtain.
1:15:10|1:15:15|Looking at the pile of coins on the table, the hostess smiled, lifted the pearl curtain, and walked up to [Geng Hao], tidying up the coins.
1:15:15|1:15:23|Sorting the bills in her hand, she then said, "[Geng Hao], sit up straight and pointed at her."
1:15:33|1:15:41|[Geng Hao] grabbed about half of the bills on the table and said, the hostess leaned on the table and adjusted for a long time before speaking.
1:16:2|1:16:9|She pressed down on [Geng Hao]'s hand, picked up a beer and poured it into her mouth. The bottle of beer kept decreasing, and soon it was empty.
1:16:10|1:16:17|[Geng Hao] is not buying it. He clenches the banknotes in front of him, stands up unsteadily, and says.
1:16:32|1:16:37|Watching [Geng Hao] drink the bathwater in front of him, the hostess was stunned, almost dumbfounded.
1:17:1|1:17:8|Faced with Geng Hao's outburst, the hostess couldn't continue playing along, and Hao Yi stepped forward to stop the two from escalating the conflict.
1:17:20|1:17:26|He nervously opened the door, only to be stunned to find the Avatar girl standing at the doorway.
1:17:34|1:17:42|The girl remained silent, took out her phone from her pocket and showed him the social media updates of [Hao Yi].
1:18:14|1:18:18|The hostess covered her face and pushed open the door, the girl left the room, and suddenly the house fell silent.
1:18:18|1:18:26|The atmosphere became somewhat awkward as the girl walked over to [Hao Yi], who was still lying on the ground.
1:18:41|1:18:55|The girl's hand gently swayed the jade Guanyin pendant that belonged to [Hao Yi].
1:18:59|1:19:5|[Hao Yi] looked at the pendant, as if a soft spot in his heart was touched by the girl.
1:19:5|1:19:13|[Hao Yi] turned his head in a fluster, adjusting his thoughts, then resolutely spoke up.
1:20:9|1:20:15|He walked out unsteadily in a bathrobe.
1:20:32|1:20:39|Just as they urged [Geng Hao] to return to the inn, a dozen motorcycles roared in and surrounded the two.
1:20:39|1:20:44|Geng Hao, Hao Yi, and the others got off the motorcycle, and among them were the two hostesses who had just been with them.
1:20:46|1:20:51|The two men referred to as "husbands" by the hostess sat on the motorcycle with a stern expression and a crew cut.
1:20:54|1:21:0|He stepped in to stop the flower-shirted henchman from beating up [Geng Hao], assuming the air of a gang leader.
1:21:1|1:21:7|Took off his glasses, one of the hostess's eyebrows was raised, making his eyes look smaller.
1:21:47|1:21:53|The younger brother stepped forward again, ready to make a move, and the hostess pulled out 200 yuan and said.
1:22:8|1:22:10|He gestured for the hostess to move aside with a pat.
1:22:10|1:22:19|He then walked up to Geng Hao in a suit, sizing him up. He pushed open Geng Hao's cuff with a rearview mirror in his hand, revealing the words "Quit Smoking". He asked.
1:22:36|1:22:44|The boss ordered [Geng Hao] to stand on the stone, while the henchman in the floral shirt hung on [Hao Yi]'s neck to control him.
1:23:14|1:23:24|[Geng Hao] started singing at the top of his lungs.
1:23:30|1:23:34|[Hao Yi]'s face twisted into a frown, looking somewhat pitifully at the side of [Geng Hao].
1:23:34|1:23:38|The crowd surrounding them burst into laughter from time to time.
1:23:50|1:24:1|Hao Yi, filled with sorrow and anger, stepped down from the rocks and accidentally pushed the boss. The little brothers were immediately unhappy, with the one in the floral shirt leading the chase to beat up Hao Yi.
1:24:1|1:24:4|While on the stone, [Geng Hao] continued to howl aimlessly.
1:24:4|1:24:9|[Hao Yi] was pressed into a corner by the crowd and beaten up, with singing, cursing, and screaming filling the air.
1:24:11|1:24:19|The sudden gunshot startled everyone, as [Hao Yi] in the corner stood up from the ground holding two guns.
1:26:42|1:26:48|After [Geng Hao] finished speaking, he burst into laughter like a madman, while [Hao Yi] panted heavily in front of him.
1:26:50|1:26:54|He shouted loudly, raised the muzzle, and fired several shots into the sky, breathing rapidly.
1:26:55|1:27:1|Staring at [Geng Hao] for a long time, seeing that he still had that indifferent attitude, made her so angry that she was shaking all over.
1:27:1|1:27:8|[Hao Yi] cleaned up the scattered items on the ground, snatched the prop gun from [Geng Hao]'s hand and stuffed it into the bag, then left on his own.
1:27:13|1:27:20|The scene cuts to the police station, where [Kang Xiaoyu] compensates the money to the bar owner.
1:27:50|1:27:57|Listening to the police officer's lecture, [Kang Xiaoyu] felt extremely depressed.
1:28:0|1:28:6|The low and oppressive music starts playing, intertwining the experiences of Geng Hao and Kang Xiaoyu.
1:28:9|1:28:12|Alone on the empty street, [Geng Hao] wakes up and deletes everything related to [Kang Xiaoyu] on his phone.
1:28:12|1:28:18|One of the things deleted was the photo of him and [Hao Yi], and suddenly he saw the message wall at the Wutong Inn in the album.
1:28:18|1:28:23|On the wall, there is a painting of "Geng Hao" with the words "I'm sorry Kang Xiaoyu".
1:28:45|1:28:50|Five years later, on another equally bleak night, [Geng Hao] frantically tries to erase the memories of his ex-wife.
1:28:51|1:29:0|In different time and space, two people are experiencing the same difficult night. The next morning, [Geng Hao] arrived outside Dali City and passed by the ancient city tower where his ex-wife had once seen.
1:29:0|1:29:10|At the same time, [Kang Xiaoyu] walked down the stairs of the Phoenix Tree Inn with her luggage, while [Geng Hao] glanced slightly outside the coffee shop where his ex-wife had once rested.
1:29:10|1:29:16|The little dog with short legs ran wildly and caught up with [Kang Xiaoyu], who was about to leave the inn.
1:29:28|1:29:37|Time flies, and [Geng Hao] has returned to the place where love began 5 years ago. Standing at the entrance of the inn, his thoughts wander back to memories.
1:29:37|1:29:42|He stood still on the corridor for a while, then finally took a step and walked into the [Wutong Inn].
1:29:43|1:29:48|The Wutong Inn is still the same as it was 5 years ago, just with more tourists enjoying themselves inside.
1:29:49|1:29:54|On the message wall, the drawings of [Geng Hao] and his ex-wife are enveloped in the joys and sorrows of all guests over the past 5 years.
1:29:55|1:30:0|[Geng Hao] stood on the other side of the wall that carried the youth and memories of countless people.
1:30:0|1:30:7|He tried hard to recall the original appearance of this wall, recalling how it used to belong to him and his ex-wife.
1:30:14|1:30:21|Stopping outside the café where she found the puppy, she looked at the ground where the puppy had once laid, feeling deeply conflicted.
1:30:21|1:30:26|She didn't want to leave the puppy in Dali, but she also didn't want to take away all the memories about Dali.
1:30:26|1:30:34|In the inn, [Geng Hao] used a dining knife to scrape his past on the message wall, but in his heart, he was still thinking about his first encounter with his ex-wife.
1:30:34|1:30:41|Outside the café, [Kang Xiaoyu] rushes to the inn, unable to let go of the brief intimacy with the little dog.
1:30:54|1:31:3|The little dog actually sat obediently in his palm. In the man's hand, the little dog was surprisingly quiet, allowing him to groom its fur.
1:31:3|1:31:9|[Kang Xiaoyu] stared at the man, slowly approached and sat down in front of him.
1:31:9|1:31:17|The man who turned around is [Geng Hao], this is the memory of his first meeting with his ex-wife.
1:32:27|1:32:34|Seeing [Kang Xiaoyu] soaking orange peel in water, [Geng Hao] threw the orange into the beer, took a sip, and made a face.
1:32:48|1:32:57|On the blank wall, [Geng Hao] left his name with no words.
1:32:57|1:33:6|On the other side of the same brick, [Kang Xiaoyu] also added her name. She looked at the empty space between the two names and felt that something was missing.
1:33:33|1:33:38|The two of them left the hall together, chatting back and forth.
1:33:38|1:33:45|Spring flowers, autumn moon, summer morning, winter rain, outside the inn, five years have passed in the blink of an eye, and the four seasons have changed.
1:33:45|1:33:52|The lighting changes, the furnishings are replaced, and the brilliance on the message wall surges day and night, adding new languages one after another.
1:33:53|1:33:59|After five years, the vicissitudes of life have left their mark on Geng Hao, entangling him in shadows from which he struggles to break free.
1:33:59|1:34:8|The once spirited young singer has become the owner of a run-down audio store, and now [Geng Hao] hardly resembles his former self.
1:34:14|1:34:28|[Geng Hao] looked at the wall, at the small trace that belonged to him, tears once again filling his eyes. He turned around, picked up the knife on the table, and walked forward with his arms raised.
1:34:28|1:34:34|The clumsy dance of the sword, against the mottled wall, he wiped away his own name.
1:34:34|1:34:42|Erasing the name of the little dog, erasing the name of [Kang Xiaoyu], wiping away everything, their meeting and acquaintance, letting go of their mutual understanding and love.
1:34:42|1:34:49|The broken wall plaster floated in the air, landing heavily in his hands, memories all dispersed like smoke.
1:34:49|1:34:53|[Geng Hao] stopped his movements and looked at the wall in front of him.
1:34:53|1:34:58|The bricks were left with scratches, just like the scar in his heart that was hard to heal.
1:34:58|1:35:3|It seems more appropriate to say it's covering up memories rather than erasing the past.
1:35:3|1:35:6|[Geng Hao] left the inn and passed by the bar.
1:36:32|1:36:39|The clever gaze and questioning of the [Innkeeper] made [Geng Hao] feel uncomfortable all over, and he awkwardly nodded and said.
1:36:44|1:36:48|The Innkeeper immediately put on a smile and handed the pipe in his hand to Geng Hao, asking him.
1:37:0|1:37:4|Amidst the mocking laughter of the crowd in the bar, [Geng Hao] waved his hand and walked out.
1:37:4|1:37:15|It's a sunny day, just like the day he left Beijing. The sunlight is strong, casting heavy shadows on the ground. [Geng Hao] walks with his head down, looking at the shadow beneath him.
1:37:15|1:37:21|Walking along, he suddenly stopped, shifted his body, and looked at the shadow moving on the ground, softly asking himself.
1:37:24|1:37:35|The sun was shining brightly, [Geng Hao] stood in the middle of the path, with the shadow of the eaves outside, his shadow beneath his feet. He raised his head slightly to meet the wind blowing from the opposite direction, recalling [Hao Yi]'s words about shadows.
1:37:57|1:38:3|Back at the bar, Geng Hao looked at the promotional video still playing and asked.
1:38:47|1:38:53|The bar owner scolded the agreeing colleague.
1:39:15|1:39:22|[Geng Hao] sprayed the anti-wolf spray wildly in the bar, causing chaos instantly.
1:39:22|1:39:26|The boss and his buddies chased after Geng Hao while enduring the scorching heat in their eyes.
1:39:26|1:39:32|[Geng Hao] pushed and shoved, throwing the disc case as a barrier to stop them, while running towards the outside of the bar.
1:39:32|1:39:38|The crowd became impatient, ignoring the clutter in the bar, picking up whatever was handy and throwing it at [Geng Hao].
1:39:40|1:39:56|The colorful curtains in the bar were torn down and draped over everyone, the balloons on the chandelier by the window were also brought down by the falling gauze, fluttering around the crowd. They chased [Geng Hao] all the way to the bar entrance, where a waiter threw a drumstick and knocked [Geng Hao] to the ground.
1:39:57|1:40:3|The bar owner and the remaining staff swarmed around [Geng Hao], beating him up with punches and kicks.
1:40:3|1:40:15|Not long after, [Geng Hao] was left bruised and swollen, grimacing on the ground as others continued to kick and punch him. However, there was no trace of regret or unwillingness on his face.
1:40:15|1:40:24|From the arms that he desperately protected his head with, you could even see some joy in him. It was only at this moment that he truly let go of the past.
1:40:24|1:40:29|The pain on his body is nothing compared to the hardships he has endured in his heart during this time.
1:40:29|1:40:35|Watching the juice and [Hao Yi] running towards him in the distance, the joy on [Geng Hao]'s face became even more apparent.
1:40:35|1:40:45|He opened his mouth wide, waving his arms frantically towards a person and a dog in the distance. However, at that moment, the innkeeper squinted his swollen eyes and raised a bottle of alcohol.
1:40:48|1:40:53|After the heavy blow, the scene was filled with intense gasps and hurried footsteps.
1:40:54|1:41:0|[Hao Yi] walked briskly down the alley towards the hospital, carrying juice and supporting the already paralyzed [Geng Hao] on his back.
1:42:3|1:42:11|[Geng Hao] touched [Hao Yi]'s leg with his hand and looked up at him, saying.
1:42:13|1:42:17|Hao Yi turned his head away, unable to bear looking at [Geng Hao] covered in blood in his arms.
1:42:17|1:42:22|The two collapsed in front of an old lady sunbathing.
1:42:24|1:42:33|Hao Yi looked at [Geng Hao] who puckered his lips on his leg, hinting for a kiss. His dying appearance made him feel sad and guilty.
1:42:33|1:42:36|Hao Yi looked up and saw an old lady on the roadside nodding at him inexplicably.
1:42:39|1:42:47|After some hesitation, Hao Yi closed his eyes with a pained expression and kissed Geng Hao on the lips, pouting as he slowly lowered his head.
1:42:47|1:42:54|Geng Hao suddenly took out his phone and aimed it at Hao Yi's pouting face, causing Hao Yi to suddenly open his eyes.
1:42:54|1:43:4|[Geng Hao] laughed heartily as he emerged from his arms.
1:43:56|1:44:1|Applause rang out as [Geng Hao] stepped onto the stage, where [Hao Yi] and the Avatar girl Dongdong were having their wedding ceremony.
1:44:24|1:44:29|On the lush green lawn, numerous balloons representing blessings are released into the air.
1:44:51|1:45:0|Kang Xiaoyu was about to leave when Geng Hao picked up her handbag left on the sofa and said, the two walked side by side in the corridor, Kang Xiaoyu broke the awkward silence and asked.
1:45:16|1:45:23|[Geng Hao] looked at [Kang Xiaoyu], only to realize that the woman he had been obsessed with was not of the same class as himself.
1:45:26|1:45:29|He watched as [Kang Xiaoyu] walked into the car and left the hotel.
1:45:29|1:45:33|The simple farewell between the two meant that [Geng Hao] had completely let go of the past.
1:45:33|1:45:44|He was dressed in a suit and looked very spirited, smiling as he walked back into the hotel. However, he ran into the bridesmaid [Xiao Bei] carrying a large bag of knives and clothes as she walked out of the lobby.
1:46:6|1:46:15|The two of them carefully chatted as they carried props and walked towards the parking lot.
1:46:22|1:46:25|[Xiao Bei] appears to be a quiet and gentle girl, somewhat lacking in verbal skills.
1:46:25|1:46:33|Two people accidentally made eye contact, then quickly looked away, feeling a hint of awkwardness in their hearts. Under the shade of trees by the roadside.
1:47:13|1:47:21|In the shade of the trees, as the two were chatting, [Hao Yi] and [Dongdong] in the wedding car were reminiscing about the past, reliving the passion.
