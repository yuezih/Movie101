0:1:11|0:1:21|In the grassland pasture, Uncle Aken is playing the guitar and singing leisurely on horseback, while the two doctors at the medical station are airing out blankets. Uncle Aken sees the two doctors and speaks to them.
0:1:35|0:1:48|Dr. Gamila smiled and waved goodbye to Uncle Aken, while three police officers from the Qingshan team in the forest were chasing two suspects on horseback without stopping, the galloping horses kicking up dust and sand on the ground.
0:1:48|0:1:56|Two suspects carrying a package, constantly keeping an eye on the police behind them, walked through the dense forest and entered the vast pasture.
0:1:56|0:2:2|They galloped away without leaving a trace, with the three police officers closely chasing after them in a determined manner.
0:2:3|0:2:11|They reached for the weapons behind them and issued a final warning to the suspect.
0:2:11|0:2:16|The two suspects ignored the police's warning and continued to flee forward with the package in hand.
0:2:37|0:2:55|The police's rope accurately looped around their necks, and after handing the package to his teammate, he fell off the horse and landed heavily on the ground.
0:2:55|0:3:0|Another suspect was successfully intercepted, and the police took the two of them back to the rescue station for questioning.
0:3:45|0:3:50|The police officer took down the lantern from the wooden pillar in the house and poured the kerosene inside onto the clothes.
0:3:50|0:3:58|The captain ordered [Hei Pi] to take out matches to ignite the clothes, and gently use tools to flip them to accelerate the burning.
0:3:58|0:4:3|Before long, the clothes were slightly charred, [Jin Ye], you go over there too.
0:4:53|0:5:23|Setting off with the Qingshan team members riding horses towards Haxiongou. Haxiongou is located in a canyon where gold prospectors produce gold sand. They decide to go there to find out more. The gold prospectors in Haxiongou have clear division of labor and are well-organized. First, they will remove the stones from the river beach, then put the mud into baskets for the first screening and filtering, then transport it to the riverbank for simple washing through a wooden channel, and finally hand-wash it in the river by a specialist. The flowing river water carries away the fine mud.
0:5:23|0:5:25|Finally, they obtained the precious golden sand.
0:5:25|0:5:31|They stood in the cold river water, wearing simple clothes and tall rubber boots, carefully washing sand.
0:5:31|0:5:38|Not far away, there is an old man with a white beard, a prospector with 30 years of gold mining experience tonight.
0:5:38|0:5:42|In front of him, a fake gold nugget was solemnly placed on a large rock.
0:5:42|0:5:46|He was devoutly using the simple brush he made to draw on it [Jin Wang].
0:5:46|0:5:47|After the gold painting was finished, he quickly knelt down.
0:5:48|0:5:52|Taking out a gold-plated tube from the shoulder bag he carried, [Jin Wang] began to pray.
0:5:52|0:5:58|The dominant [Jin Wang] is a strong woman, wearing a leather coat, making new gold panning tools out of wood.
0:5:58|0:6:2|At this moment, an uncle rushed over to him anxiously and said,
0:6:17|0:6:21|[Hei Pi] gathered three batches of gold and kept running towards the Ha Xiong Valley.
0:6:21|0:6:29|He ran while looking back to assess the situation, never expecting someone to be waiting ahead to ambush him.
0:6:29|0:6:34|The uncle mercilessly moved the stick down, causing [Hei Pi] to fall heavily to the ground.
0:6:34|0:6:36|The two immediately moved forward to search for the gold.
0:6:46|0:6:55|Hei Pi woke up without warning, grabbed the gold again, and refused to let go even when knocked to the ground.
0:6:55|0:7:7|Just as Uncle Jin Wang raised his stick to strike again, Fang Ming arrived in time and stopped them.
0:7:7|0:7:11|The two of them ran away upon seeing the situation, and the injured [Hei Pi] quickly took [Jin Wang] away.
0:7:24|0:7:28|On the other side, a sweet photo of Dr. [Jiagamina] and [Hailati] hangs on the wall of the rescue station.
0:8:1|0:8:7|[Gamila] picked up the bag of gold on the table, glanced at [Hei Pi], and casually put the gold into the drawer of the bedside table.
0:8:7|0:8:11|[Radar] and [Alimu] left the rescue station on horseback.
0:8:11|0:8:24|Under the influence of drugs, [Hei Pi] gradually regained consciousness. He opened his eyes to see the unfamiliar surroundings, the clean hospital bed, and [Jia Mila] in doctor's attire beside him, making him realize that he was lying in a medical station.
0:8:24|0:8:34|He quickly felt around for the gold on his body, only to find it empty. As he turned his head, he saw the familiar cloth bag in the drawer, which was the very bag he used to hold the gold.
0:8:34|0:8:42|At this moment, [Jin Wang] was squatting on the ground, scrubbing the clothes in the ceramic basin, completely unaware that danger was approaching.
0:8:42|0:8:44|[Hei Pi] picked up the firewood on the ground and glared fiercely at [Jin Wang].
0:8:45|0:8:52|He walked with a face full of shame, step by step, just as Jin Ye was about to turn around, Hei Pi picked up firewood and smashed it fiercely towards his head.
0:8:52|0:8:57|After he let out a miserable cry and fell to the ground unconscious, [Hei Pi] was in a panic.
0:8:57|0:9:4|He dropped the firewood and prepared to escape, but the ring on Kagmira's hand caught his attention. He quickly took off the ring and left in a panic.
0:9:5|0:9:8|Unexpectedly, they encountered [Heilati] and others on the way, and had to return to the medical station.
0:9:8|0:9:11|He made a quick decision and changed direction to run to the other side.
0:9:11|0:9:16|[Hailati] returned to the medical station and saw a mess on the ground, feeling that something was wrong.
0:9:50|0:9:58|The team's words gradually calmed down [Jin Wang], and Gamilra was taken to the hospital, with various instruments inserted all over his body, lying on the sickbed on the verge of death.
0:9:58|0:10:5|The nurse adjusted the equipment and left the ward, leaving [Heilati] sitting by the bedside, gently holding Gamila's hand.
0:10:6|0:10:11|He gently touched the middle finger of Jin Wang, where the ring should have been, feeling deeply sorrowful.
0:10:11|0:10:16|He held Gamila's hand, pressed it against his cheek, unable to hold back the tears streaming down his face.
0:10:16|0:10:23|He stared fixedly at his wife on the sickbed, tears streaming down his cheeks, too preoccupied to care.
0:11:7|0:11:10|[Hailati] hesitated to speak, with a look of disappointment on his face.
0:11:10|0:11:14|[Hei Pi] staggered into the woods, clutching his wounds.
0:11:14|0:11:21|Exhausted and in a sorry state, Jin Wang was approached by a girl with twin ponytails, [Tu Tu], who walked through the rocks.
0:11:21|0:11:27|He looked at [Hei Pi] with a puzzled expression, didn't say a word, and then [Hei Pi] was discovered by the gold prospectors.
0:11:27|0:11:31|The [Jin Ye] in the room heard the noise and quickly picked up the crystal tube and walked out.
0:12:0|0:12:7|Hei Pi's answer undoubtedly sparked anger, and the fleeing guests punched and kicked him. Jin Ye, seeing this, expressed his own idea to Jin Wang.
0:12:22|0:12:25|[Hei Pi] was tied up by everyone and dropped in mid-air.
0:12:25|0:12:32|[Jin Wang] took off his leather jacket and casually threw it on the rocks, then picked up a thick wooden stick and slowly walked towards him.
0:12:32|0:12:40|[Jin Ye] sat on the side with his eyes closed, spinning the baton. [Jin Wang] picked up a wooden stick and fiercely stabbed [Hei Pi] in the abdomen with the thick end.
0:12:42|0:12:47|[Hei Pi] suddenly began to vomit violently.
0:12:47|0:13:2|At this moment, the vomit on the ground caught the attention of the gold prospectors.
0:13:2|0:13:9|[Jin Ye] put away the gold bucket, took out a piece of gold from [Hei Pi]'s vomit, and said to him with great sincerity.
0:14:33|0:14:41|Making everyone aware of the seriousness of the problem, with a scale, a table, and a large tray, the gold gambling site is ready.
0:14:41|0:14:45|The fleeing gold diggers took out the gold they had panned and placed it in the tray.
0:14:45|0:14:57|[Jin Wang] prays in front of the golden lump, taking off his hat, clasping his hands together, closing his eyes, bowing down to worship the golden lump. [Jin Ye] stands beside him, shaking a golden cylinder and muttering words under his breath.
0:14:57|0:15:8|Maintaining the order of the gold rush, the prospectors orderly stepped forward to hand over their gold, and even shook their bags at the end, afraid of missing a grain of gold dust.
0:15:8|0:15:15|With everyone's efforts, more and more gold piled up in the tray, while [Hei Pi], who was tied up, stared at the gold with his eyes fixed.
0:15:15|0:15:23|After escaping and being beaten, his clothes were covered in mud and sand, the bandage on his head was no longer clean, and the pain in his body made his expression fierce.
0:15:24|0:15:41|The gold in the pan is increasing, already piled up into a small mountain shape. The riverbank where they used to work is now empty, the gold prospectors' year of hard work is about to pay off. Through this final gold rush, they will receive their corresponding rewards, allowing them to pack up and start their journey back home.
0:15:43|0:15:47|As the sky darkens, the burning torches bring a glimmer of light to the crowd.
0:15:47|0:15:55|[Jin Ye], under the gaze of everyone, wrapped the gold into small packages, then weighed them to ensure each package had the same weight, and distributed them fairly.
0:15:55|0:15:58|[Jin Wang] also shared his thoughts with everyone.
0:17:10|0:17:18|The next day, a vast grassland stretched endlessly, with herds of cattle and sheep leisurely grazing.
0:17:18|0:17:26|The camel carried heavy goods and obediently lay on the ground. The herder uncle unloaded his luggage from the camel and prepared to set up a tent.
0:17:26|0:17:29|The daughter shouted loudly in the distance.
0:17:32|0:17:36|Uncle Aken waved to his daughter and walked towards everyone with a straw mat in his arms.
0:17:51|0:17:56|Looking up, a large group of birds darkened the sky as they flew towards the crowd.
0:18:31|0:18:35|[Hailati] is waiting for the chief to respond after explaining the situation.
0:18:35|0:18:39|Unexpectedly, at this moment, a large number of black birds in the sky caught his attention.
0:18:39|0:18:45|He lowered his head in contemplation, let out a long sigh, and the warm sunlight spilled over the vast grassland.
0:18:45|0:18:49|The herdsmen heeded [Jin Ye]'s advice and began to move their livestock.
0:18:49|0:18:55|They rode on tall steeds, wielding whips in their hands, driving the animals towards the right path.
0:18:55|0:19:0|The migrating herd of sheep forms a beautiful scenery, but the herdsmen have no time to appreciate it.
0:19:0|0:19:4|They must move to a safe place before the blizzard arrives.
0:19:4|0:19:23|As the sun sets and the sky darkens, a strong wind blows across the grassland, causing trees to bend and leaves to swirl in the air. The tools of the gold prospectors in Axiong Gully are blown off the ground, with iron buckets and tires rolling around. The tent made of reeds is also torn apart by the wind, prompting the prospectors to wrap themselves tightly in their clothes.
0:19:23|0:19:24|Hid in Jin Wang's house.
0:19:25|0:19:32|On the other side, the herdsmen also faced a huge ceasefire. The weather suddenly changed, the temperature dropped, and the sky was full of sandstorms that made it impossible to open their eyes.
0:19:32|0:19:45|The migration of herds of cattle and sheep in a short period of time is extremely difficult. They put on their thick winter clothes and ride on horses to drive them. They wave their whips to whip them, and the exhausted cattle also let out painful moans.
0:19:45|0:20:4|The next day, the mountains were covered with snow, and all that could be seen were the tall trees. The rest of the grass and shrubs had disappeared without a trace. The snowflakes fell like cotton, dressing the grassland in a cold coat. The herdsmen suffered major losses, and Uncle [Heilati] led his family in praying to the heavens.
0:20:4|0:20:8|They knelt in the cold snow, extending their hands in devout prayer.
0:20:37|0:20:40|Upon learning about the situation of [Hailati], [Fang Ming] looked worried.
0:20:40|0:20:46|After a day and a night, the snow in Haxiong Gou finally stopped, and the gold prospectors began to emerge from their homes.
0:20:46|0:20:49|[Jin Ye] also emerged from his small house.
0:20:49|0:20:52|He stood with snowflakes on his head, carefully observing his surroundings.
0:20:55|0:21:1|[Jin Wang] found his door blocked by heavy snow, so he cleverly ran to the window to check the situation.
0:21:43|0:21:48|Seeing the suspicious behavior of Jing Ye, [Jin Wang] and his alliance approached him, wanting to find out the truth.
0:22:45|0:22:50|At the same time, the sudden heavy snowfall also trapped the police officers at the checkpoint.
0:24:24|0:24:28|The rare blizzard that started at 19:00 yesterday has hit the entire Ashan region.
0:24:29|0:24:33|The temperature in some sealed areas has dropped to minus 45 degrees Celsius.
0:24:33|0:24:39|There is expected to be a bigger blizzard in two to three days, possibly setting a new historical record.
0:24:39|0:24:42|Currently, many roads leading to the mountainous areas have been blocked by heavy snow.
0:24:42|0:24:48|The local government and the stationed troops have set up relief stations for disaster victims in the pastoral areas and townships where vehicles can pass through in Ashan region.
0:24:48|0:24:52|The government requires the herdsmen to move to the rescue station as soon as possible for timely assistance.
0:24:52|0:24:54|At the same time, the nomads who couldn't gather together were asked to persevere in self-rescue.
0:24:55|0:24:59|Do not give up hope of survival, the government and the stationed troops will do their best to conduct search and rescue.
0:24:59|0:25:6|Tourists on the 24th downstream are stranded on the roadside in the wilderness, the situation is very dangerous.
0:25:6|0:25:13|Lane 26 is blocked, with a large number of vehicles stuck in the traffic jam, personnel need to be rescued.
0:25:13|0:25:14|Visitor number 24 is stranded on the roadside in the wilderness, the situation is very dangerous.
0:27:11|0:27:15|After the meeting, the leader of the Qingshan team, [Hailati], immediately set off.
0:27:15|0:27:22|They rode the new snowmobile to the Black Wind Pass checkpoint without stopping.
0:27:22|0:27:28|The motorcycle left tracks in the snow, the biting wind and snow did not hinder their progress.
0:27:28|0:27:34|At this moment, the Black Wind Pass checkpoint was quiet, with an eagle perched on a stone at the entrance, squawking incessantly.
0:27:34|0:27:41|The alliance of people came out of the tent to check the situation, the note tied to the eagle's foot by [Jin Wang] brought hope to everyone.
0:27:41|0:27:45|Captain Liu took down the note and examined it.
0:28:43|0:28:50|[Jin Wang] and his team reached a consensus and formed a mighty team, then set off for the Black Wind Pass inspection station.
0:28:50|0:29:0|The chicken blood as thick as the knees was nothing to them. They held shovels and hoes, aggressively advancing towards the inspection station.
0:29:0|0:29:6|[Jin Wang] and [Fang Ming] were wearing hats, scarves, and long coats, with thick blankets on their backs. Their eyes were determined and their spirits high.
0:29:14|0:29:21|Captain Liu saw the situation was not good, so he quickly brought Xiao Zhang to the entrance of the checkpoint and called on his brothers to start setting up defenses.
0:29:29|0:29:48|Ali Mu quickly heard Liu Zhanchang's orders, hurriedly locked the gate with an iron chain, and drove the only car to the front of the checkpoint, just to stop the crazy escapees from Beijing.
0:29:48|0:29:52|At the command of [Ma Dongmei], the girls all lined up in front of the queue.
0:30:14|0:30:20|The gold prospectors spread the blankets on the iron wire pattern, cooperated to climb over the gate, and threw their tools inside.
0:30:30|0:30:34|Together, Jin Wang, Fang Ming, Jin Ye, and Hei Pi worked together to move the car and used a utility pole to break open the gate of the checkpoint.
0:30:55|0:31:2|The persuasion of the police officers had no effect at all. Meanwhile, Jin Wang and the team were urgently trying to stop the bleeding.
0:31:4|0:31:23|[Jin Wang] continued to urge everyone to move towards Death Valley. The kind-hearted guests rushed to the mountaintop. At this moment, halfway there, [Jin Ye] suddenly stopped. He adjusted his hat and subtly signaled [Jin Wang] to stop moving forward. Lao Mao appeared to cheer everyone on and lead the way, but in reality, he also stopped in his tracks.
0:31:25|0:31:29|[Hailati] and the team rode snowmobiles to the top of the mountain.
0:31:37|0:31:46|The gold prospectors rushed towards the mountains along the main road, completely unaware that [Jin Wang] and [Jin Ye] had already taken a small team of gold prospectors up the mountain via a side path.
0:31:46|0:31:49|They walked through the forest, stepping on the thick snow, heading towards the mountaintop.
0:31:49|0:31:59|The gold prospectors have been blinded by the legend of the Snowy Grand Realm, roaring faithfully as they set off into the mountains. Fortunately, [Heilati] and the team intercepted them.
0:32:2|0:32:8|The appearance of Team Qingshan made everyone stop in their tracks, filled with questions.
0:32:38|0:32:45|Kang Xue has already decided in the command post that he will never risk going down the mountain to mine the gold in the Kuzi Jinsha, nor will he forcibly acquire it.
0:34:2|0:34:15|[Hailati] listened, with a hint of ruthlessness in his eyes. The government set up a relief point on the grassland, and the relief supplies brought by military vehicles were distributed through the river and then transported to the relief station in the mountains by horse-drawn carriages.
0:34:15|0:34:19|Inside the tent is a temporary medical station, providing free health check-ups for the herdsmen.
0:36:11|0:36:15|Hundreds of carriages loaded with supplies set off in a grand procession.
0:36:15|0:36:22|They marched towards the mountain rescue station in three groups, carrying bright flags and wearing thick military coats.
0:36:29|0:36:33|The orderly line in the snow forms a beautiful scenery.
0:36:33|0:36:38|The experienced shepherd Jin Wang raised the whip in his hand and led the team towards the right path.
0:37:18|0:37:21|The crowd immediately ran towards the tent upon hearing this.
0:37:21|0:37:25|[Hailati] quickly walked up to the radio station, took off the leather gloves, and put them to his ear to respond.
0:38:20|0:38:28|[Jin Wang] led the gold panning team to continue moving forward, the scenery on the mountain stretched endlessly, with no trees, only vast snow-covered land.
0:38:28|0:38:29|[Jin Ye] addressed everyone.
0:38:33|0:38:59|Tonight, with the support of [Jin Wang], leading the way, the others followed them as they continued forward. [Uncle Aken] is leading the rescue team, rushing towards the Black Wind Pass checkpoint. The grand procession stands out in the vast snowy landscape, with running horses kicking up snowflakes. Experienced herdsmen crack their whips and drive the horse-drawn carriages. [Heilati] has also embarked on the search for people.
0:39:16|0:39:23|[Uncle Aken] led the rescue team to the Feihonghou checkpoint, where over a hundred refugees trapped there cheered happily upon seeing them.
0:40:7|0:40:12|This is the place where the legendary pillowcase was found, and the guests here call it Golden Valley.
0:40:23|0:40:30|By the following spring, the bodies began to decay, and all living creatures in the valley were infected with the plague, even the wolf packs were not spared.
0:40:30|0:40:33|Since then, the locals started calling this place Death Valley.
0:40:41|0:40:46|The footprints in the snow were blown away by the strong wind, and [Fang Ming] got out of the car and raised his own question.
0:41:51|0:41:54|Later I blamed him, but he said.
0:42:11|0:42:15|[Hailati] expressed his thoughts to his teammates and decided to continue moving forward.
0:42:15|0:42:22|Uncle Aken, worried about everyone's safety, decides to take supplies with a snow shovel pear to rescue them.
0:42:22|0:42:33|The weather in the Land of Death became increasingly severe, with howling winds and snow filling the sky. Even the wolf pack in the valley lost their way, as the chilling wind kept the three of them huddled together.
0:42:38|0:42:42|[Hailati] looked at the snowfield ahead and sensed a hint of danger.
0:42:42|0:42:47|He squatted down and scooped up a handful of snow, shaping it into a snowball before throwing it into the snowfield.
0:42:47|0:42:53|The snowball landed and created a big pit, which was then filled up by the wind and snow.
0:43:23|0:43:27|The gold mining team stood on the hillside and threw stones at Jin Wang, Fang Ming, and Jin Ye.
0:43:27|0:43:30|To avoid the attack, they had to roll down the hillside.
0:43:30|0:43:36|Radar had just stood up when he was hit in the calf by a stone and fell heavily to the ground.
0:43:51|0:43:56|Sadik opened the backpack and saw that the radio inside had been smashed to pieces.
0:43:56|0:43:58|Looking at the damaged radio, the crowd was furious.
0:44:2|0:44:12|[Hailati] looked at the broken radio in silence, as the rescue team led by Uncle Aken and the Qingshan team members, with supplies in hand, had already set off.
0:44:27|0:44:34|The situation in Death Valley is very dangerous. The two of them brought some branches and did a simple bandaging for the radar.
0:44:36|0:44:39|Radar sat in the snow, grimacing in pain.
0:44:39|0:44:44|Sadik lifted his leg, placed a wooden stick under it, and [Hailati] took out a rope to help him bandage it.
0:44:44|0:44:50|The intense pain made Jin Wang unable to help but cry out, and they set up a bonfire in the snow.
0:44:50|0:44:53|And on the distant hillside, a pack of wolves is staring at them.
0:44:53|0:44:56|This is the must-pass road to Death Valley.
0:45:23|0:45:29|Defense Bureau, we have lost contact with [Jin Ye] and his team for over three hours.
0:45:29|0:45:31|In addition, the recent weather forecast said,
0:45:34|0:45:40|If they can't come out before 4 p.m. tomorrow, the temperature in Death Valley will drop to more than fifty degrees below zero since the blizzard.
0:45:40|0:45:42|No one will survive by then.
0:45:44|0:45:55|[Hailati] embarked on the journey to find gold miners alone. Along the way, he used a knife to pierce the bark and leave marks, carrying a bundle on his back, following the route to Death Valley as he remembered.
0:45:55|0:46:10|[Jin Ye] led the gold panning team to arrive at Death Valley. He was very excited when he saw the scene in front of him. He quickly signaled the young man to put him down, adjusted his hat, and hurriedly ran into Death Valley. Seeing this, everyone immediately followed suit.
0:46:11|0:46:17|The scene in front of them stunned everyone present, with the stone path stretching neatly to the foot of Death Valley.
0:47:31|0:47:34|Sadik finished speaking and then turned towards the woods.
0:47:34|0:47:37|The gold mining team also built a fire and continued digging.
0:47:37|0:47:42|[Jin Ye] and [Jin Wang] kept picking up stones, trying to distinguish them, afraid of missing the pillowcases.
0:47:44|0:47:50|At night, as the temperature in the canyon dropped, the gold panning team followed [Jin Ye] to a cave.
0:47:50|0:47:54|They walked in cautiously with torches in hand for illumination.
0:47:54|0:47:58|The cave was overgrown with weeds, a desolate scene.
0:47:58|0:48:2|With the help of torches, everyone gradually saw the situation inside the cave.
0:48:2|0:48:6|They stepped on the dry weeds and walked step by step towards the depths of the cave.
0:48:7|0:48:12|Following [Jin Ye]'s steps, everyone walked cautiously, not daring to make a sound.
0:48:12|0:48:16|[Jin Ye] looked at the familiar things in the cave and couldn't help but sigh.
0:48:33|0:48:48|In the snowy field outside the east, everyone quickly picked up torches and went to check the situation.
0:48:48|0:48:51|Several skeletons on the ground shocked everyone.
0:49:9|0:49:12|Hei Pi is strong and gradually comes to his senses.
0:49:12|0:49:19|He adjusted his hat and, along with everyone else, began to carefully move the bone frame on the ground.
0:49:27|0:49:32|The gold prospectors took out lanterns and bedding from their packs, preparing to camp in the cave.
0:49:48|0:49:53|While everyone was busy burying the bone frame, [Jin Ye] sneaked away to the front.
0:49:53|0:50:0|[Hailati] was walking in the snow with a bundle of firewood on his back, but the next moment, he slipped and had an accident.
0:50:21|0:50:25|The huge snow pit flowed into the man-eating black hole, swallowing [Hailati].
0:50:25|0:50:29|A gust of wind and snow blew in, completely obscuring any trace of the fall.
0:50:34|0:50:38|Radar crawled towards Sadik with his injured right leg.
0:50:38|0:50:45|Unfortunately, the snow pit was long gone at this point, but the cleaning team still persevered in their search for the pillowcase.
0:51:53|0:52:2|Rabbit squatted beside the tiger pile, adding firewood, completely unaware that [Hei Pi] had been staring at him, while the gold prospectors continued to search for the pillowcase with their tools.
0:52:2|0:52:12|The basket contained everyone's dry rations, with only Tu Tu left in the cave. He filled the teapot with water and placed it on the tiger pile to heat it up, then went to the hot spring with a towel.
0:52:12|0:52:19|He took off his warm hat, looked at his reflection in the water, adjusted his braided hair, and prepared to wash up.
0:52:19|0:52:31|[Hei Pi] quietly entered the cave with a bundle of firewood, closely watching the back of the rabbit. He slowly approached the tiger's den and set down the firewood in his hands.
0:52:31|0:52:39|The sudden sound startled Tu Tu, who quickly stood up and looked at [Hei Pi] approaching him with a wary expression.
0:52:53|0:53:0|Hei Pi took out the ring he snatched from Gamila and said affectionately to Tu Tu.
0:53:22|0:53:29|At this moment, [Jin Ye] walked into the cave holding a stone, and [Hei Pi], who was strong, immediately stood up and hurriedly ran away.
0:53:29|0:53:33|[Jin Ye] looked at his strange behavior and already had the answer in his heart.
0:53:33|0:53:41|Rabbit Rabbit slowly came to his senses, quickly putting away the ring. [Jin Ye] looked at the flustered Rabbit Rabbit and walked slowly to his side, saying with great emphasis.
0:53:44|0:53:48|Rabbit was at a loss and dared not answer, so he ran out of the cave with his head down.
0:53:48|0:53:55|[Jin Ye] watched his departing figure, then looked at the stone in his hand, quickly walked to the edge of the hot spring and squatted down, starting to wash the stone.
0:53:58|0:54:9|[Jin Wang] also entered the cave at this time. [Jin Ye] sensed movement behind him, quickly threw the stone aside, casually picked up another stone to inspect, muttering to himself. [Jin Wang] slowly approached him.
0:54:29|0:54:34|[Jin Ye] heard this and turned to look at [Jin Wang], without answering. The weather was cold, and he couldn't help but cough.
0:54:34|0:54:41|[Jin Wang] saw the situation and smiled as he patted his back. The two of them didn't notice at all that [Hei Pi] was watching them from the shadows.
0:55:5|0:55:19|Uncle Aken led the rescue team through the heavy snow towards Death Valley. Inside the cave, [Jin Ye] was sitting on the ground smoking, carefully recalling the events of the past few days, trying to find clues about the pillowcase.
0:55:19|0:55:34|He suddenly recalled the sound of the stone falling to the ground when he was moving the bone frame that day, and suddenly realized. He quickly walked towards the stone, reached out a hand to pick it up, but the pillowcase slipped from his hand and fell heavily to the ground.
0:55:35|0:55:41|He excitedly held up the pillowcase with both hands, wiping away the surface dust, his eyes filled with incredulity.
0:55:41|0:55:45|He took the stone to the riverbank to wash it.
0:55:45|0:55:49|After a moment of scrubbing, the pillowcase gradually revealed its original appearance.
0:56:2|0:56:13|Suddenly, a figure flashed at the entrance of the cave, causing [Jin Ye] to change his expression drastically. He quickly threw the pillow towel into the hot spring, while on the other side, [Hei Pi] had been moving in the snow all night with the radar, the situation was very dangerous.
0:56:13|0:56:17|Luckily Uncle Aken and the rescue team arrived in time and found him.
0:56:25|0:56:28|The radar's badge is very obvious in the snow.
0:56:28|0:56:31|The police immediately turned him over and recognized his identity.
0:56:57|0:57:6|Everyone unbuttoned Jin Wang's clothes, exposing his limbs, and began rubbing his body with cloth in the hope of reviving him.
0:57:6|0:57:10|After a while of discussion, Uncle Aken finally voiced his thoughts.
0:57:23|0:57:27|Upon hearing Captain Liu's explanation, Uncle Aken no longer said anything more.
0:57:27|0:57:29|Continue to help Radar rub his body.
0:57:29|0:57:35|Xiao Zhang looked at the horse on the hill with some reluctance, hesitated for a moment, and then fired the gun.
0:57:35|0:57:43|Uncle Aken prayed devoutly to the heavens, as [Fang Ming] swiftly raised his knife and cut open the horse's belly.
0:58:2|0:58:6|Just received the horse blood, and in no time it had frozen into ice blocks.
0:58:6|0:58:10|[Fang Ming] crushed the horse blood with a knife and fed it to Radar himself.
0:58:10|0:58:18|Uncle Aken took out a felt blanket, and Radar, who was frozen stiff, couldn't open his mouth and remained unconscious.
0:58:18|0:58:23|In desperation, [Fang Ming] pried open his mouth and fed him horse blood bit by bit.
0:58:23|0:58:29|With the careful care of everyone, Radar gradually regained consciousness, and everyone showed a satisfied smile at the scene.
0:58:44|0:58:47|Looking along the radar's line of sight, Jin Wang saw only a bundle of firewood.
0:58:52|0:59:7|[Fang Ming] and two team members hurried towards the hill where the firewood was located, only to be heartbroken by the scene before them, a huge slope appeared in front of them, [Hei Pi]'s hat lay lonely in the snow.
0:59:7|0:59:15|[Hailati] has been buried by heavy snow, leaving no trace behind. The pure snowflakes have turned into sharp blades, taking away [Hailati]'s life.
0:59:16|0:59:24|The three of them were deeply saddened by the situation, they sorrowfully took off their hats and paid a solemn tribute to [Heilati].
1:0:48|1:0:56|[Jin Ye]'s words undoubtedly sparked controversy. He was grabbed by a man, punched to the ground, and then everyone else joined in the fight.
1:0:56|1:1:0|[Jin Wang] saw his fellow villager being beaten, so he picked up a stick and joined the fight.
1:1:0|1:1:5|[Jin Ye] was terrified and quickly hid to the side, as the battle between the people from Gansu and Ningxia officially began.
1:1:12|1:1:18|Lao Meng said as he grabbed Jin Wang from behind and wrestled him to the ground, the two of them fighting in the alley leading to the tomb.
1:1:18|1:1:24|In the dimly lit cave, the scene was chaotic. [Ma Dongmei] saw the situation becoming tense and quickly grabbed the package, rushing towards the rabbits.
1:1:39|1:1:45|[Auntie] screamed and ran back into the cave, causing panic among the others who looked cautiously at the cave entrance.
1:1:45|1:1:50|Uncle Aken and the rescue team also noticed the markings on the trees ahead.
1:3:4|1:3:9|A swirling sound came from above their heads, and everyone looked up curiously, puzzled.
1:3:9|1:3:15|It's not raining, a strong airflow rushes into the cave, everyone is terrified and quickly retreats into the cave.
1:3:15|1:3:21|At the same time, [Jin Ye] took advantage of the chaos to run to the hot spring to fish for the handkerchief, but was seen by [Jin Wang] in the dark.
1:3:21|1:3:28|The strong wind extinguished the bonfire, leaving the cave pitch black. Outside the cave, the collapsed snow cascaded down like a flood.
1:3:29|1:3:32|The entrance was completely blocked by heavy snow.
1:3:32|1:3:43|The people in the cave were still puzzled at this moment, and after the avalanche ended, they raised their inner doubts.
1:4:16|1:4:21|[Jin Wang] knocked [Hei Pi] unconscious with a stone and took away his flashlight.
1:4:33|1:4:39|[Jin Wang] quickly crouched down and searched [Fang Ming] all over, but found nothing in the end.
1:4:53|1:5:0|The uncle lit a torch with a match, and [Fang Ming] gradually regained consciousness in the light of the fire.
1:5:45|1:6:19|We should listen to him. Our lives are more important. Everyone took tools and started digging at the entrance of the cave. [Jin Ye] stood aside holding a flashlight to illuminate for everyone, while [Jin Wang] directed everyone's actions with a flashlight.
1:6:26|1:6:31|Ma Er Gu held a shovel and approached [Fang Ming] quietly.
1:6:47|1:6:53|[Tutu] used a pottery jar to scoop water from the hot spring and brought it to [Hailati].
1:6:53|1:6:58|[Hailati] saw him and thanked him gently, saying to him.
1:7:32|1:7:36|The Rabbit Gang helped [Hailati] untie the rope, and the ring accidentally fell out.
1:8:14|1:8:19|Stammering, [Jin Wang] looked at [Hei Pi] in confusion, while [Fang Ming] hurriedly ran towards [Hei Pi].
1:8:43|1:8:50|[Hailati] pressed [Hei Pi] onto the snow pile, glaring at him fiercely, angrily pointing a gun at [Hei Pi]'s head.
1:8:50|1:8:52|[Jin Ye] watched from the side, also feeling shocked and against the war.
1:8:52|1:8:57|Uncle Aken, with the rescue team, has now arrived at the valley entrance, inside the cave.
1:8:57|1:9:1|[Hailati] also picked up a shovel and joined the team digging snow.
1:9:1|1:9:2|They dug out a passage.
1:9:2|1:9:5|[Jin Wang] cautiously moved forward with a shovel, feeling his way in the dark.
1:9:5|1:9:11|At this moment, [Hei Pi] was tied up and thrown into the cave, looking around anxiously, trying to break free from the ropes.
1:9:12|1:9:23|Not far away, [Jin Wang] and [Jin Ye] are sitting together talking. Half of the snow has been dug out by everyone, and they are throwing the snow they dug out into the cave, step by step exploring towards the cave entrance.
1:9:32|1:9:45|A small hole was slowly poked open, and [Jin Wang] struggled to drill out from inside. He widened the hole with a shovel, and then the fugitives also struggled to climb out from inside one after another.
1:9:45|1:9:54|Looking at the magnificent snow-covered scenery outside, everyone was successfully rescued. [Jin Ye] pulled them out one by one and kindly reminded them.
1:10:9|1:10:15|During the battle, [Jin Wang] approached [Hei Pi], took off his padded jacket, and cut the rope that bound him with a knife.
1:10:15|1:10:23|[Hei Pi] is strong and somewhat flattered. He watched as [Jin Wang] knelt in front of him and said.
1:11:11|1:11:17|[Jin Wang] did not respond to [Hei Pi]'s words, picked up the cotton coat and left quietly. [Hei Pi] gazed at his back for a long time.
1:11:22|1:11:26|It's already past 1 o'clock, and the rescue team still hasn't found [Hailati] and Neijinke.
1:11:26|1:11:31|If there is no better way, they will all be trapped and die in the Death Valley.
1:11:35|1:11:38|A deadly storm is about to hit Death Valley.
1:11:38|1:11:45|In order to timely rescue the gold prospectors and police in Death Valley, [Fang Ming] decided to send out two helicopters for the rescue.
1:11:45|1:11:51|The crew prepared supplies and stretchers for the helicopter, and two medical personnel were also on board.
1:11:51|1:11:53|[Hailati] also led the gold prospectors to start their return journey.
1:12:0|1:12:8|After walking out of the woods, [Jin Wang] gave a meaningful look to [Hei Pi].
1:12:8|1:12:15|[Hei Pi] immediately understood, broke free from the ropes, took out a dagger, and quickly walked towards Tu Tu, using the dagger to kidnap Tu Tu.
1:14:7|1:14:13|[Jin Ye] saw everyone rescuing Tu Tu, so he left the team alone. [Jin Wang] immediately followed suit.
1:14:56|1:15:2|[Hei Pi] sneakily hid the pistol in his sleeve and cunningly followed the crowd towards the rescue team.
1:15:2|1:15:9|[Hailati] breathed a sigh of relief as he watched Jin Wang regain his senses, then turned to search for his pistol in the snow.
1:15:9|1:15:17|The gold prospectors looked at the two trucks as if they had seen the dawn of hope, carrying their luggage and running towards the rescue team.
1:15:17|1:15:20|Uncle Aken stopped Parry halfway up the slope.
1:15:20|1:15:25|The rescuers were eager to save lives, completely unaware of the danger, Uncle Akun quickly stepped in to stop them.
1:16:20|1:16:26|[Jin Ye] squatted down and took out a clean floral cloth from the messenger bag he carried with him.
1:16:26|1:16:30|He took off his gloves, trembling hands, and carefully opened it.
1:16:30|1:16:33|A fluffy pillowcase appeared in front of the two characters.
1:16:36|1:16:42|Jin Ye's attention was drawn to the helicopter in the sky, and Jin Wang followed his gaze.
1:16:42|1:16:46|Before long, he came to his senses and said to [Jin Ye].
1:16:57|1:17:0|[Jin Ye] subconsciously stepped back, only to anger [Jin Wang].
1:17:0|1:17:5|He took out a dagger and slowly advanced towards [Jin Ye].
1:17:5|1:17:7|[Jin Ye] saw the situation and quickly ran towards the hillside.
1:17:7|1:17:13|[Jin Wang] tackled him down in the snow, brandishing the dagger in his hand, intending to kill him.
1:17:39|1:17:47|At a critical moment, [Heila Ti] tackled [Jin Wang], and [Jin Ye] looked at his injured right hand and sighed.
1:17:47|1:17:58|The helicopter successfully locked onto the location of the group and prepared to land. The huge rotor blades stirred up a flurry of snow, causing everyone to squint their eyes and quickly cover their cheeks with their sleeves.
1:18:22|1:18:29|[Hailati] and [Jin Wang] were wrestling together, with a kick to the abdomen of [Jin Wang] followed by a punch that knocked [Jin Wang] to the ground.
1:18:29|1:18:33|[Jin Wang] picked up the dagger dropped in the snow and stabbed towards [Hei Pi].
1:18:33|1:18:40|[Hailati] quickly made a defensive posture to resist, but he still tore his clothes and knocked him down with another punch.
1:18:40|1:18:45|As he was trying to get up, he was kicked in the head by [Jin Wang], emitting a painful scream.
1:18:45|1:18:49|[Jin Wang] looked at [Hailati], pointed a knife at him, and issued the final warning.
1:19:15|1:19:19|[Hailati] dropped his backpack and pounced towards [Jin Wang].
1:19:19|1:19:24|He grabbed [Jin Wang]'s arm and threw him over his shoulder, knocking him to the ground.
1:19:24|1:19:29|[Jin Wang] was trying to get up, but he was grabbed by the collar and hit on the head, then knocked down hard.
1:19:29|1:19:35|[Jin Wang] was beaten to the point where he couldn't fight back, and the dagger in his hand had already fallen into the snow.
1:19:35|1:19:39|[Hailati] every move hits the mark perfectly.
1:19:39|1:19:41|After several rounds, Jin Wang was knocked down to the ground.
1:19:44|1:19:48|From the hillside in the distance, [Hei Pi] silently watches everything.
1:19:48|1:19:51|[Hailati] looked at [Jin Wang] on the ground.
1:20:2|1:20:8|[Jin Wang] seized the opportunity while [Hailati] was speaking, picked up the dagger from the ground, and fiercely stabbed towards him.
1:20:8|1:20:13|Although [Hailati] reacted quickly and discovered it in time, he was still knocked to the ground by [Jin Wang].
1:20:13|1:20:18|[Jin Wang] exerted all his strength to stab the dagger in his hand towards [Hei Pi].
1:20:18|1:20:25|[Jin Ye] saw [Jin Wang] being so ruthless and crazy, and viciously smashed the back of his head with the pillow tendon in his hand.
1:20:25|1:20:28|A moment of painful howling, [Jin Wang] was then knocked down to the ground.
1:20:29|1:20:35|[Jin Wang] slowly stood up with a dagger in hand, [Jin Ye] gestured for [Hei Pi] to leave first, but was met with a refusal.
1:20:51|1:20:55|The two pushed and shoved each other as they walked down the hillside.
1:20:55|1:21:0|[Jin Wang] was about to go down to chase, when a stone at his feet caught his attention.
1:21:0|1:21:3|He crouched down and plunged the dagger into the snow.
1:21:3|1:21:9|With a stone in his hands, before he could even feel happy, a gunshot rang out from behind.
1:21:9|1:21:11|[Hei Pi] appeared in the snow with a gun.
1:21:11|1:21:14|[Jin Wang] stood up, looking at him incredulously.
1:21:14|1:21:19|Mercilessly, [Hei Pi] once again fired his gun, hitting [Jin Wang] directly in the heart.
1:21:24|1:21:39|The stone finally slipped from [Jin Wang]'s hand and fell heavily into the snow, triggering two gunshots that caused a massive avalanche. A large amount of snow poured down from the mountaintop in an instant, rushing down the mountain.
1:22:17|1:22:25|Greedy [Hei Pi] approached [Jin Wang], picked up a stone, and laughed happily, completely unaware that a huge avalanche was heading towards him from behind.
1:22:32|1:22:47|[Hailati] looked at the large amount of snow falling lightly, turned around, and ran towards the helicopter's position. The snow quickly flowed, and the strong airflow immediately blew [Jin Wang] and [Hei Pi] out. The police officer on the helicopter quickly threw down the rope ladder.
1:22:48|1:22:57|The rope ladder swayed in the air, [Jin Wang] gasping for breath, took a big leap onto the rope ladder, with blood flowing behind him, instantly flooding the valley.
1:22:57|1:23:6|The helicopter took off, and [Fang Ming] was successfully rescued at the last moment. The helicopter carried them away from this dangerous area.
1:23:6|1:23:13|The soft rope ladder swayed from side to side in the wind, and [Hailati] held onto it tightly, feeling relieved.
1:23:13|1:23:18|[Hailati] looked down at the situation under his feet, and the milky white clouds kept surging forward.
1:23:18|1:23:22|The trees in the canyon are also covered by countless snowflakes.
1:23:22|1:23:31|The helicopter flew over the treacherous Death Valley, with the flowing snow below resembling a rushing Yellow River, majestic and imposing.
1:23:31|1:23:33|Tonight, Jin Wang stood watching the snow at his feet, lost in thought.
1:23:39|1:23:46|Captain Liu successfully pulled [Hailati] back onto the helicopter, and then quickly retracted the rope ladder and closed the cabin door.
1:23:46|1:23:53|The helicopter is flying steadily in the air, and two medical staff members come forward to urgently treat everyone's wounds.
1:23:56|1:24:3|[Jin Ye] thanked the medical staff with a look of sorrow on his face, while Uncle Aken, who was familiar with him, walked up to him and spoke to him.
1:24:21|1:24:25|Tonight, [Jin Wang] took the pancake handed to him by Uncle Aken, his eyes filled with gratitude.
1:24:25|1:24:31|He looked at the pancake in his hand, feeling guilty as he looked at the exhausted [Hei Pi] beside him.
1:24:31|1:24:38|After a moment of contemplation, he handed the pancake to the old man next to him and carefully took out a piece of pillowcase from his pocket.
1:24:38|1:24:47|Under the astonished gaze of the crowd, he caressed the pillowcase in his hand, then raised his head and said to [Hailati].
1:24:50|1:25:0|Tonight, [Hei Pi] knelt in front of [Jin Wang] with a pillow in his hands, trembling as he presented it to him.
1:25:21|1:25:36|[Aken Uncle] helped [Jin Ye] back to his original position, [Hailati] took the heavy pillow towel from [Liu Captain]'s hand, turned and looked meaningfully at [Jin Ye]. The helicopter returned to the rescue station along the route, and the snow in the sky was falling heavier and heavier at this moment.
1:25:38|1:25:43|On that day, the Ashan region experienced the heaviest snowfall in 50 years.
1:25:43|1:25:48|With the assistance of the local government, all the disaster victims have been properly resettled.
