0:1:57|0:2:11|In the year 2046, the robot [K-88] left a message: "God created man, man created robots. Man can doubt God, why can't robots doubt man?"
0:2:11|0:2:31|The scene suddenly shifts to a quiet village, where a prison van is driving alone on a narrow road that can only accommodate one vehicle. Inside the van sits a man wearing sunglasses, with fake eyebrows and a lazy posture. Through the reflection of the sunglasses, it is clear to see that there are three men in police uniforms sitting opposite him.
0:2:41|0:2:43|Which comrade's gun is aimed at [Xu Dachun].
0:3:10|0:3:23|The police officer in the car immediately picked up the submachine gun and aimed it at [Xu Dachun] as he fell down.
0:3:39|0:3:57|The originally uninvolved citizens immediately stopped in their tracks, looking in unison at Xu Dachun driving the steamroller towards them. They instinctively stood in front of K-1, blocking it. Xu Dachun, caught off guard, could only jerk the steering wheel, allowing the steamroller to crash into the stall. At the same time, he pulled out handcuffs, flipped onto the roof of the vehicle, and hung the handcuffs on the rope hanging above.
0:3:57|0:4:7|Sliding along the rope, [Xu Dachun] moves like a god, holding the handcuffs in his left hand and pulling out a gun in his right hand, continuously shooting at [K-1] in front. After [K-1] falls to the ground, a close-up shot.
0:4:36|0:4:45|The people who were originally blocking [Xu Dachun] were now applauding for him with smiles, and his teammates who had been watching also walked over with smiles.
0:4:45|0:5:1|Facing the questioning from [Xu Dachun], his teammates smiled without saying a word. They all turned to look behind them, where a luxurious sedan was parked behind the crowd. A curly-haired middle-aged man lowered the car window and calmly raised the corners of his mouth.
0:5:1|0:5:4|Suddenly, [Xu Dachun] pushed [Su Mei] aside and sat by the window, frowning.
0:6:57|0:7:0|[Xu Dachun] nodded thoughtfully.
0:7:52|0:7:58|At this moment, [K-1] sauntered to the door blowing bubble gum, giving a provocative look to [Xu Dachun] with a tug.
0:8:3|0:8:9|The van dropped off [K-1] and [Xu Dachun] at a remote bus stop and then drove off.
0:8:9|0:8:17|[Xu Dachun] sat in the factory, looking gloomy with a face that clearly said "don't mess with me". It was obvious that he hadn't recovered from what had just happened.
0:8:17|0:8:28|[K-1] sat next to [Xu Dachun] with a helpless expression on his face. He glanced at [Xu Dachun] quietly, realizing that [Xu Dachun] didn't want to talk to him. He lowered his head, took out a cigarette box from his pocket, and flashed a signature smile at [Xu Dachun].
0:8:49|0:8:51|[Xu Dachun] reluctantly lit a cigarette.
0:8:53|0:9:0|[K-1] saw the situation and very attentively took out a lighter to light a cigarette for [Xu Dachun], then skillfully lit one for himself.
0:9:0|0:9:10|[Xu Dachun] watched [K-1]'s skilled movements, his eyes widening in amazement. Suddenly, [K-1] showed off again, blowing smoke rings in the shape of a heart.
0:9:19|0:9:25|[K-1] took another deep drag on his cigarette, then closed his eyes, pinched his nose, and smoke rings unexpectedly came out of his ears.
0:9:38|0:9:48|[Xu Dachun] lay on the hospital bed, his eyes lifeless and swollen, as if he had been punched several times.
0:9:48|0:9:52|And at this moment, the workplace of [Xu Dachun], the Pingnan Town Police Station, presented a different scene.
0:10:41|0:10:49|[Su Mei] has a neat short hair and wears thick glasses, with a serious expression on her face.
0:10:49|0:10:52|At this moment, [Xu Dachun] returned with [K-1].
0:11:21|0:11:34|[K-1] looked at [Su Mei] with a puzzled expression.
0:11:34|0:11:38|Dachun stopped K-1, who wanted to shake hands with [Su Mei], and took him to the stairwell.
0:11:48|0:11:53|Facing the narrow and cluttered stairwell, [K-1] showed no signs of discontent.
0:11:53|0:11:57|He casually tossed the backpack aside and carefully picked up the newspaper on the ground to put it into the cardboard box.
0:12:37|0:12:39|[Xiao Jiang] doesn't mind, he grins widely, showing his crooked teeth.
0:13:12|0:13:20|Everyone hadn't recovered from the explosion in front of the computer, when [K-1] walked over with his index finger held high.
0:13:20|0:13:32|He completely ignored the scrutinizing gaze of [Su Mei], and paid no attention to the astonished looks of his colleagues around him. He calmly pressed a button on the computer host and rotated his fingers 180 degrees, causing the computer desktop to immediately return to normal.
0:13:36|0:13:43|[K-1] walked into his own stairwell, snapping his fingers, leaving behind a cool silhouette that left everyone stunned.
0:14:0|0:14:4|Dachun and [Su Mei] walk in the market, while K-1 walks alongside on the other side.
0:14:22|0:14:34|[K-1] was seen aiming at a piece of paper that read "I'm willing" and showing it to [Su Mei].
0:14:34|0:14:38|[Su Mei] turned around and saw [K-1] holding up a newspaper again, on which it was written that he was talking nonsense.
0:15:4|0:15:17|After receiving the hint from [K-1], [Su Mei] couldn't help but speak out, and indeed, [Xu Dachun] had hidden the money in the sole of his shoe.
0:15:17|0:15:20|[Xu Dachun] awkwardly squatted down and pulled out a banknote that the boss found very distasteful.
0:15:38|0:15:42|[K-1] and [Su Mei] have already developed feelings for each other during this eye contact.
0:15:42|0:15:46|[Xu Dachun] folded up the quilt hanging on the pole and looked back at the children carrying their school bags.
0:16:6|0:16:10|The auntie entered the room with a blanket, while [Su Mei] was tidying up in front of the mirror.
0:16:26|0:16:28|Aunt Yan raised a sand pot discontentedly.
0:16:58|0:17:15|[Xu Dachun] approached [Su Mei] with soy milk and fried dough sticks, but received no response, and even got an eye roll from the inspector.
0:17:23|0:17:30|[Xu Dachun], ignoring dissuasion, rushed up to the second floor in three or two steps, ready to break down the door, but the door opened by itself.
0:17:30|0:17:36|[Xu Dachun] remained in a daze while holding the door, but [K-1] was unfazed and even invited him in.
0:17:36|0:17:42|[K-1] was seen leisurely sitting on a leather chair flipping through a book, while the back of the chair constantly displayed a charging status.
0:18:30|0:18:32|Mrs. Li lost sixteen dollars and seven cents.
0:18:46|0:18:47|These cases have not been solved for such a long time.
0:19:34|0:19:40|[K-1] quickly solved these difficult problems, and the grateful villagers crowded the entrance of the police station to express their thanks.
0:19:49|0:19:55|Watching [K-1] moving effortlessly through the crowd, a smile appeared on [Su Mei]'s face.
0:19:55|0:19:58|And when Teacher [Xiao Jiang], who was hiding on the side, saw this scene, he left in disappointment.
0:19:58|0:20:2|In the evening, the enthusiastic colleagues held a celebration banquet for [K-1].
0:20:2|0:20:13|As the end approached, everyone got drunk and started arguing about who would take Su Mei home.
0:20:18|0:20:23|Several colleagues supported each other as they left, leaving only [K-1] and [Su Mei] still standing in place.
0:20:23|0:20:27|The two of them did not speak, but tacitly walked forward at the same time.
0:20:27|0:20:34|In this unusually ambiguous atmosphere, [K-1]'s eyes sparkled as he immediately activated the search function.
0:20:48|0:20:49|Su Mei is even more upset when she hears this.
0:20:49|0:20:52|She pouted, with a look of almost crying, and stood still for a while before continuing to walk forward.
0:21:30|0:21:41|Under the earnest gaze of [K-1], [Su Mei] finally compromised and closed her eyes. [K-1] raised his finger, and a fluorescent light flowed towards his fingertip, causing [Su Mei] to furrow her brows slightly in response to the light.
0:21:46|0:21:57|After the strong light flashed, [Su Mei] found everything in front of her blurred. Perplexed, she quickly took off her glasses and put them back on. After repeating this several times, the world without glasses became clearer.
0:21:57|0:22:7|In front of him, [K-1]'s face became more handsome. [K-1] did not dodge, allowing [Su Mei] to hit his cheek, and [Su Mei]'s gaze gradually changed from initial doubt to deep affection.
0:22:8|0:22:12|Suddenly, [K-1] stared closely at the corner of [Su Mei]'s mouth and took a few steps forward.
0:22:12|0:22:20|[Su Mei], although a bit flustered, still shyly lowered her eyes. [K-1] reached out his hand and gently touched the corner of [Su Mei]'s mouth with deep affection.
0:22:21|0:22:25|[K-1] lightly brushed past [Su Mei]'s lips and walked away without looking back.
0:22:25|0:22:32|[Su Mei] put away her smile, slowly opened her eyes, but at the moment she saw the back of [K-1], she lifted the corners of her mouth again.
0:22:32|0:22:36|She hurriedly followed the footsteps of [K-1] through an alley, but did not find her figure.
0:22:37|0:22:49|Anxious [Su Mei] took a few more steps forward, looking around, then suddenly stopped in one direction, a smile appeared on [Su Mei]'s face again, even a tear glistened in her eyes.
0:23:4|0:23:7|[K-1] rode around [Su Mei] on a bike, circling her again and again.
0:23:9|0:23:14|[K-1] firmly held onto the handlebars with one hand, while reaching out to [Su Mei] with the other hand.
0:23:14|0:23:19|[Su Mei] is beaming with a happy smile, immersed in this sweet and beautiful moment.
0:23:19|0:23:24|She sat on the back seat of [K-1]'s bicycle, with his hands gently holding her waist, heading towards home together.
0:23:24|0:23:26|At this moment, [Su Mei] succumbed.
0:23:26|0:23:30|Even though it was late at night, the small noodle stall by the roadside was still bustling with people.
0:23:30|0:23:35|A man is lying on the dining table, seemingly asleep, with four or five beer bottles next to him.
0:23:35|0:23:37|At this moment, Teacher [Xiao Jiang] also came to the stall in person.
0:23:44|0:23:50|As [Xiao Jiang] squinted at the boss's face, the man sleeping next to him suddenly raised his head.
0:23:50|0:23:54|The familiar face left Teacher [Xiao Jiang] a bit confused.
0:25:6|0:25:12|Teacher [Xiao Jiang] and [Xu Dachun] exchanged a smile, then immediately searched for the 369 virus on the computer.
0:25:31|0:25:41|[Xiao Jiang] pressed the enter key, and the short-skirted beauty on the screen sensually swayed her body. The vacuum cleaner and remote-controlled car at home also began to restlessly move around.
0:25:41|0:25:47|Under the beauty's blowing kiss, [Xu Dachun] felt like he was floating on air.
0:25:47|0:25:52|The sudden knocking on the door brought Xu Dachun back to reality.
0:25:52|0:25:57|[Xiao Jiang] obediently pressed the exit key, and as the screen went black, all the household appliances stopped working.
0:26:2|0:26:6|[Su Qing] accidentally pressed the virus switch, and at that moment, even the chirping of the clock-telling birds sounded eerie.
0:26:30|0:26:34|[Xu Dachun] slipped and was firmly secured by the massage chair.
0:26:34|0:26:39|Suddenly, a clear smoke emerged from the computer, and the virus erupted completely.
0:27:15|0:27:22|[K-1] extended his index finger towards the computer socket again, and with a gentle twist, all the devices in the room came to a halt.
0:28:28|0:28:35|Thinking he was in favor, [Xu Dachun] glared fiercely from upstairs, then went back to sleep, leaving more people sleepless tonight.
0:28:35|0:28:44|At this moment, [Su Mei] hugged herself in sorrow, sitting quietly by the window, gazing at the moonlight outside. The table lamp in the room resembled an opened flower umbrella, emitting a dim light.
0:28:45|0:28:47|It's as if [K-1] is in Su Mei's heart.
0:28:47|0:28:53|On the way home riding a bike, [Su Mei] quietly put the glasses into [K-1]'s pocket.
0:28:53|0:28:57|At this moment, [K-1] took out [Su Mei]'s glasses and held them up in front of his eyes, shining.
0:28:57|0:29:0|He furrowed his brow, his eyes filled with confusion.
0:29:0|0:29:6|[Su Mei] still faced the bright moonlight, took out a wooden comb from her bosom, and combed her parted bangs into one piece.
0:29:6|0:29:11|He seemed to have figured something out, as his bangs covered his eyes, his smile kept growing.
0:29:11|0:29:16|In the end, Xu Dachun gently brushed Su Mei's bangs back into place, perhaps this is the beauty of a secret crush.
0:29:22|0:29:29|At this moment, [K-1] is sitting cross-legged on the toilet seat in the police station restroom, continuously shining [Su Mei]'s glasses in his hand.
0:29:29|0:29:36|After a long while, he sighed deeply, put his glasses back into his pocket, and took out a newspaper from his chest to unfold.
0:29:36|0:29:41|The newspaper instantly turned into a flat shape, with various news about robots constantly popping up.
0:29:58|0:30:4|In K-1's mind, involuntarily appeared the image of his arm around Su Mei when she was going home.
0:30:18|0:30:22|[K-1] showed a look of panic on his usually calm face for the first time.
0:30:35|0:30:39|Su Mei's smile and glance instantly captivated Xu Dachun.
0:30:39|0:30:43|However, the next moment, [Su Mei] sat down next to [K-1].
0:30:50|0:31:3|[K-1] nodded coldly and went to sit down on the other side.
0:31:3|0:31:8|K-1's actions made Su Mei feel a bit lost, and at this moment, Xu Dachun also looked displeased at Su Mei.
0:31:12|0:31:17|[Su Mei] slammed the table in anger, then stood up and walked over to [Xu Dachun], giving her a fierce glare.
0:32:20|0:32:27|[Su Mei] glared angrily at [Xu Dachun], while [K-1] pretended not to hear the words, looking silently to the other side.
0:32:39|0:32:45|In the rundown factory, [Xu Dachun] is on the phone, wearing a low-brimmed beret and a fierce expression.
0:32:45|0:32:47|At this moment, [K-1] and [Xu Dachun] walked into the factory.
0:32:58|0:33:4|At the corner, a golden retriever is tied up. Its tail immediately droops when it sees [Xu Dachun].
0:33:35|0:33:40|Upon hearing the sound, Xu Dachun immediately ran towards the rooftop, but was seen through clearly by K-1's X-ray eyes.
0:33:40|0:33:50|To catch up with the target quickly, [K-1] activated part of his robot form, with thrusters appearing on his fingertips and back, breaking through the ceiling and flying in front of [Su Qing].
0:33:50|0:33:55|But [Xu Dachun] not only did not surrender, but instead raised the submachine gun in his hand and fired wildly at [K-1].
0:33:55|0:34:0|[K-1] used the "Welcoming Wave Micro Step" to charge towards [Xu Dachun], while also dodging the bullets by turning his head.
0:34:0|0:34:4|Suddenly, two thrusters went out, causing him to veer towards the central tower brick wall.
0:34:14|0:34:19|And at this moment, [Xu Dachun] had his left hand on the top, holding a walkie-talkie in his right hand, with a contented expression on his face.
0:34:19|0:34:27|[K-1] barely manipulated the thrusters to land, opened the battery box in the abdomen, only to find that it was out of power.
0:34:27|0:34:30|Coincidentally, the desperate Sang Biao ran to the two of them.
0:34:32|0:34:41|Without waiting for [Xu Dachun] to react, Cang Biao fired the gun first and shot through the skin on [K-1]'s face.
0:34:41|0:34:51|[K-1] slowly lowered his head, then suddenly pointed forward, stopping his finger just before the needle.
0:34:51|0:34:58|[Xu Dachun] pushed [K-1] away and aggressively chased after him with a gun. But after running a few steps, he got pricked in the butt by [K-1]'s needle.
0:35:1|0:35:7|[K-1], with extremely low power, is moving abnormally slowly and falls back into a dormant state once again.
0:35:7|0:35:13|The needle stuck in [Xu Dachun]'s buttocks immediately took effect, causing his face to turn blue and his movements to become sluggish.
0:35:13|0:35:17|The clueless mourner turned back and chased after [Xu Dachun] with a puzzled look on his face.
0:35:17|0:35:21|[Xu Dachun] wanted to cry but had no tears. He tried his best to stop the car and then turned around to run back.
0:35:28|0:35:33|[K-1], lying on the ground, shot another dart purely by instinct, hitting [Xu Dachun] right in the chest.
0:35:33|0:35:40|[Xu Dachun] had a look of wanting to cry, and could only run forward desperately, but the speed was not much faster than a sloth.
0:35:40|0:35:46|[K-1] had no idea about [Xu Dachun]'s situation, and went back into sleep mode. In a panic, [Xu Dachun] had to jump from the second floor.
0:35:46|0:35:59|Unexpectedly, as the slow-acting needle took effect to the extreme, [Xu Dachun] found his falling speed slowing down significantly. He could only watch as [K-1], using the nearby scaffolding, effortlessly reached another level and raised his fist.
0:35:59|0:36:5|Poor [Xu Dachun] hadn't even landed yet when his chin was hit by [K-1]'s full-force uppercut, sending him slowly flying back up.
0:36:6|0:36:13|While [Sang Biao] stood with hands on hips, staring intently at the police officer falling in front of him, he raised the steel knife in his hand.
0:36:13|0:36:18|Suddenly, [K-1] and [K-88] moved in unison, their faces turning blue, with three fingers slowly approaching their backs.
0:36:20|0:36:30|At this moment, as the slow-acting needle of Xu Dachun gradually wears off, his complexion finally returns to normal. Feeling indignant, he raises his fist and aims a punch straight at Lin Xiang's face.
0:36:30|0:36:34|[Sang Biao] couldn't even make it through, he was hit so hard that even his saliva sprayed out.
0:36:34|0:36:40|But he refused to show weakness and immediately raised his knife to strike at [Xu Dachun]. However, at this moment, all of [Sang Biao]'s movements appeared to be in slow motion in [Xu Dachun]'s eyes.
0:36:41|0:36:44|He squatted down and [Sang Biao] couldn't find a trace of him.
0:36:44|0:36:51|[Sang Biao] lowered his head in confusion, only to see [Xu Dachun] holding several finger-length nails and firmly nailing his own feet to the ground.
0:36:51|0:36:54|Before the anguished Sang Biao could even cry out, he was punched to the ground by [Xu Dachun].
0:36:58|0:37:3|At this moment, Xu Dachun's men arrived late, rushing into the factory with guns in hand.
0:37:3|0:37:7|[Su Mei], dressed in a smart police uniform, hurriedly rushed to the front.
0:37:7|0:37:12|Xu Dachun's smile had not fully formed when he noticed in Su Mei's eyes only K-1 lying on the ground.
0:37:18|0:37:24|[Su Qing], with black hair hanging in front of her face, was running past [Su Mei] with a towel twisted in her hand.
0:37:24|0:37:29|[Su Mei] remained silent, lowering her head and fiddling with the cup in her hands, looking deeply troubled.
0:37:29|0:37:33|The next day, [Su Mei] arrived at the door of [K-1] with a bowl of porridge.
0:37:46|0:37:50|[K-1] sat silently on the stairs with his face covered in gauze, staring at the doorway.
0:37:50|0:37:54|After a long time, he slowly lowered his head and ultimately did not go to open the door.
0:37:54|0:37:58|Su Mei, who had been waiting for a long time, finally ran out of patience and left with a bowl in hand.
0:41:48|0:41:51|Upon hearing this, [Su Mei] couldn't help but look at the [K-1] in front of her.
0:41:51|0:41:59|[K-1] wrapped his head like a zongzi to prevent revealing his robot identity, only showing a pair of drooping eyes, unwilling to face everything in front of him.
0:42:0|0:42:6|[Xu Dachun] finally regained his senses and choked up as he handed the key to [Su Mei].
0:42:6|0:42:13|Seeing that Su Mei didn't take it, Xu Dachun stuffed the key into Su Mei's hand.
0:42:13|0:42:18|After saying these words, [Xu Dachun] no longer looked at [Su Mei], but walked forward despondently.
0:42:18|0:42:28|[Su Mei] didn't pay attention to [Xu Dachun]'s actions, but kept staring at [K-1], who didn't respond. He avoided [Su Mei]'s gaze and turned away from the courtyard.
0:42:35|0:42:42|At this moment, in Xu Dachun's office, [Lin Xiang] personally brings people to repair the gunshot wound on [K-1]'s face.
0:42:42|0:42:44|Soon, the bandage on [K-1] was unwrapped.
0:44:7|0:44:10|The most brilliant master of learning in the country has designed a prime minister for them.
0:44:25|0:44:27|A straight and high nose.
0:44:31|0:44:35|With a kind appearance, [Xu Dachun] is very family-oriented.
0:45:28|0:45:46|Xu Dachun, originally holding a grudge, immediately turned dark when he saw [K-1]. Despite his reluctance, Xu Dachun and [K-1] embarked on the journey to subdue [K-88] together. Xu Dachun sat by the window on the ferry with a desolate expression, staring blankly outside.
0:45:46|0:46:4|And behind him stood the expressionless [K-1], leaning against the railing with one hand supporting his head, looking towards the other side. The two never exchanged a word throughout. Finally, unable to contain her emotions, [Su Mei] rushed to the ferry. However, when she peered into the cabin, Dachun was still sitting there with a worried look on his face, but [K-1] was nowhere to be seen.
0:46:4|0:46:13|[Su Mei] subconsciously dodged to one side, then glanced quietly at Xu Dachun in the distance. Xu Dachun, who was bored, took out a cookie from his pocket to pass the time.
0:46:13|0:46:18|Su Mei felt guilty towards Xu Dachun in her heart, but she was unwilling to entangle further, watching as the boat was about to start.
0:46:18|0:46:25|He still looked unwillingly around, the scenes at the ferry crossing were all about farewells, either with laughter or sadness.
0:46:25|0:46:31|And [Su Mei] didn't even see the person she wanted to say goodbye to. She leaned against the door, silent, and eventually left in loneliness.
0:46:31|0:46:47|At this moment, [K-1] was hiding behind a broken door panel at the stern of the ship. He only peeked out after confirming that [Su Mei] had left. He stared at the figure of [Su Mei] as she walked away, his eyes revealing a mix of longing and reluctance. He was unwilling to take his eyes off her for a long time, perhaps not even knowing the reason himself.
0:46:47|0:46:52|Soon, [K-1] and Xu Dachun adjusted their emotions and began to carry out the mission.
0:46:52|0:47:4|That day, they found the whereabouts of [K-88] in a remote small inn. [K-1] disguised as a guest to attract the attention of the landlady, while Xu Dachun sneaked upstairs in disguise to meet with [K-88].
0:47:39|0:47:43|Xu Dachun took out a ballpoint pen from his pocket as he spoke.
0:48:10|0:48:17|Xu Dachun, dressed in a black trench coat, with a mysterious look on his face, walked forward without waiting for K-88 to react.
0:48:17|0:48:22|However, the beads of sweat dripping down from his forehead betrayed his current mood.
0:48:22|0:48:32|Under Xu Dachun's persuasion, [K-88] got into Xu Dachun's car and arrived at the deserted mountain road. Suddenly, the car stopped.
0:48:39|0:48:45|Xu Dachun calmly takes out the Lin Xiaona pole from the hat, presses the button, but only music is heard.
0:49:21|0:49:25|Suddenly, a clap of thunder sounded, and [K-88] looked out the window intently.
0:49:25|0:49:29|Xu Dachun pressed the I button, but there was still only music playing.
0:49:29|0:49:32|[K-88] with red eyes, clearly sees [K-1] rushing towards them.
0:49:38|0:49:45|At this moment, Dachun shoulders the individual rocket launcher and aims at [K-88].
0:49:48|0:49:55|[K-88] not only did not dodge, but also opened its lower jaw, transforming into a mechanical form, and directly swallowed the shell.
0:49:55|0:50:1|In the next second, an explosion wave spewed out from the mouth, turning the car into charcoal in an instant, even [Xu Dachun] was knocked out far away.
0:50:1|0:50:6|[Xu Dachun] was still searching for people everywhere, while [K-1] and [K-88] had already fought 800 rounds.
0:50:7|0:50:16|[K-1] single-handedly blocked the fireball from [Xu Dachun], who was thrown off and slammed into a hard stone wall by the tremendous impact.
0:50:16|0:50:25|Even so, [K-1] once again flew towards them, smashing and knocking down the rocks, blocking the fatal blow for [Xu Dachun], while [K-88] walked over unscathed at this moment.
0:50:27|0:50:35|[K-1] immediately rushed in front of the large vehicle and transformed into a driving mode.
0:50:35|0:50:39|[K-88] calmly transforms into a green sports car and speeds away.
0:50:46|0:50:50|Seeing the off-road vehicle chasing from behind, [Xu Dachun] immediately started spinning the steering wheel frantically.
0:50:50|0:50:58|At the same time, [K-1] also began to evolve, widening its wheel hubs and transforming into a motorcycle, with thrusters added to the rear of the vehicle.
0:50:58|0:51:6|But even so, [Xu Dachun] couldn't shake off [K-88] behind him. The throttle of the off-road vehicle was pushed to the maximum, and the speed instantly soared to 200 kilometers per hour.
0:51:6|0:51:11|Just like that, two cars flashed by like sharp blades, leaving only a lingering shadow on the road.
0:51:11|0:51:15|The human body couldn't withstand such speed for long, so [Xu Dachun] gritted his teeth.
0:51:26|0:51:29|In the next moment, [K-88] sets up a cannon on the roof of the car.
0:51:30|0:51:38|Compared to K-88's weapon, the rocket launcher in Xu Dachun's hands seemed like a toy. He turned around in panic, letting K-1 take him flying.
0:51:38|0:51:54|Quickly, [K-88] completed the filling, and a super large shell shot straight towards them. With [K-1]'s extreme turn, the shell grazed past them, blasting a big hole in front of them. Unable to land perfectly, [K-1] leaped up, flipped in the air, and transformed into a white robot.
0:52:1|0:52:19|[K-88] couldn't hold back any longer. He spread the electric current all over the ground and struck down with his palm. This move had tremendous force, causing the ground to crack open with rocks and sand flying towards [K-1]. However, [K-1] managed to evade the attack with a series of backflips.
0:52:20|0:52:31|Suspended in mid-air with the help of a thruster, [Xu Dachun] made a provocative gesture towards [K-88]. [K-88], strong and powerful, pushed off the ground and leaped directly into the air, while [K-1] took the opportunity to kick towards him.
0:52:31|0:52:36|Thus, the two generations of super robots engaged in a battle for the first time in their strongest forms.
0:52:36|0:52:55|[K-1] gave [K-88] a kick to the chest, and the high-speed rotating gears seemed like a cutting machine, instantly tearing open a gap in front of him. Just as [K-88] barely dodged a spinning kick from [K-1], he was once again hit by a punch to the cheek. The powerful punch sent him crashing towards the ground, only managing to hang in mid-air with the help of thrusters.
0:52:55|0:53:13|After finally stabilizing his posture, [K-88] looked up again, with a burst of divine light in his eyes. However, [K-1]'s abilities were not limited to this. Two metal rods flew out from his scapula, transforming into nunchucks under the connection of lightning. Unwilling to show weakness, [K-88] picked up a huge rock and threw it towards [K-1].
0:53:13|0:53:25|However, [K-1] simply waved his double sticks lightly, and the huge rock instantly turned into pieces. Then, [K-1] swiftly charged towards [K-88], using a mesmerizing set of double stick techniques to shatter various blue and green rocks into pieces.
0:53:25|0:53:40|However, the last huge rock was split open by [Blue Demon], with [K-88] behind wielding dual blades full of killing intent. At this point, the battle had escalated to a white-hot intensity, with the weapons of both sides bursting with sparks in the clash, residual forces crisscrossing in the air, making it difficult to determine the outcome for a moment.
0:53:40|0:53:50|[K-88] took the lead, swinging a sword towards [K-1]. [K-1] dodged the blade by leaning to the side, while also throwing out the nunchaku in hand. [K-88] immediately used the dual knives to block in front of his chest.
0:53:50|0:53:52|But still couldn't remove the force.
0:53:52|0:54:11|Backing up a bit, [K-88] once again lunged forward, but his blade was easily blocked by the nunchucks. Seeing that close combat was ineffective, [K-88] turned his blades towards [K-1]. However, not only did [K-1] easily dodge the attack, he also managed to disarm [K-88] of his blades. After retrieving his weapons, [K-88] had a determined look on his face and finally unleashed his ultimate skill.
0:54:11|0:54:15|The fierce flames instantly spread across the dual blades, overwhelming even [K-1].
0:54:16|0:54:29|With [K-88] soaring into the air, the raging flames transformed into sharp blades and headed straight towards [K-1]. [K-1] intended to counterattack with a dual strike from the south, but their formidable weapon was directly split in half, along with themselves, by a fiery slash across the waist.
0:54:29|0:54:36|[K-1] lost combat effectiveness in an instant, gently falling down. When [Xu Dachun] looked up again, he saw that [K-1] had already returned to human form.
0:54:37|0:54:43|Lying in a sorry state on the side, [K-88] retracted his moves and transformed back into human form, landing slowly.
0:54:43|0:54:49|[Xu Dachun] didn't hold back his anger and pulled out his gun [I-bar] once again.
0:54:49|0:54:53|The familiar music plays again, and [Xu Dachun] looks at [K-88] with a solemn expression.
0:54:59|0:55:5|After being stomped on fiercely, I-Gong emitted a piercing bell sound, which piqued [Xu Dachun]'s curiosity as he picked it up to examine.
0:55:5|0:55:22|And at the moment when he controlled I-Gong with his hand, he suddenly transformed into a mechanical cannon attached to [Xu Dachun]'s shoulder. [K-88] looked wary, alertly took a step back, and [Xu Dachun] immediately exerted force, arrogantly aiming the cannon at [K-88], but no matter how many times he pulled the trigger, the cannon remained motionless.
0:55:49|0:55:55|[Xu Dachun] didn't hesitate, turned around and ran, while [K-1] reached out and lay in front of [K-88].
0:55:55|0:56:9|[K-88] obviously is very proficient in martial arts. He kicked [K-1] in the leg, then lifted him up with one hand and threw him heavily to the side.
0:56:9|0:56:14|[K-88] raised [K-1] with one hand, then mercilessly pulled out the battery box from his body and threw it away.
0:56:48|0:57:9|[K-88] grabbed [K-1] by the collar, desperately seeking answers, but in the end only received a bewildered and weak gaze.
0:57:19|0:57:24|At this moment, [K-1] was completely defenseless, allowing [K-88] to charge at him again and crash into a pile of rubble.
0:57:24|0:57:30|When [K-88] rushed over to deliver a fatal blow, he found [Xu Dachun], who had originally escaped, appearing in front of him.
0:57:33|0:57:39|[Xu Dachun] is no longer afraid of [K-88], he raises the battery box in his hand and reinserts it into the abdomen of [K-1].
0:57:39|0:57:48|The [K-1] of the Law of Restoration seemed to wake up from a dream, gasping for breath as he sat up. Just as he gratefully looked towards [Xu Dachun], a sharp blade emerged from [Xu Dachun]'s back.
0:57:48|0:57:54|Dachun looked down in disbelief at his chest, watching as [K-88] pulled out a long knife.
0:57:54|0:57:58|Suddenly, the mechanical cannon on the right arm was activated, and Dachun immediately turned around and bit K-88.
0:58:3|0:58:9|The cannon fired a beam of light, spreading between the two of them, and [K-88] didn't even have a chance to react.
0:58:9|0:58:24|After the intense light, metal parts scattered everywhere. [K-1]'s hair stood up straight from the explosion, lying unconscious on the ground. Not far from him, [K-88] had turned into a pile of scattered pieces, with the simulated skin on his thigh blown open, revealing two metal bones.
0:58:24|0:58:30|[K-1] suddenly opened his eyes sharply, twitched a few times as he looked at the scene in front of him, and then struggled to move backwards.
0:59:5|0:59:15|Dachun lay weakly in the arms of [K-1], looking at him with an incredibly gentle smile.
0:59:15|0:59:25|Dachun's expression suddenly stiffened, his head weakly falling down, while blood from the corner of his mouth had already soaked through his chest along his neck. [K-1] stood still, staring blankly at the ground.
0:59:27|0:59:37|He roared in despair, his gaze suddenly fixed on a certain spot. When he looked back at Xu Dachun, his eyes revealed determination and madness.
0:59:37|0:59:44|At this moment, the scene shifts to Tian'an Research Center, where it is gloomy and dim, with only some numb staff walking back and forth.
0:59:44|0:59:49|Lin Xiang poured out a twisted iron wire from the test tube, looking surprised.
0:59:54|1:0:9|At night, a lively banquet was held in Pingnan Town.
1:0:9|1:0:22|[Su Mei] nodded thoughtfully, took a deep breath after a while, while Teacher [Xiao Jiang] behind her would occasionally glance back at her.
1:0:29|1:0:34|[Xu Dachun] gave Song Mei a warm hug, then kindly held his hand, full of concern.
1:1:12|1:1:30|[Su Qing], expressionless, analyzed everything and then drifted away like a ghost.
1:1:30|1:1:38|[Xiao Jiang] sat by the riverbank, feeling down. He wrote "Xiao Jiang loves Su Mei" on a wooden board, then wiped it off in despair.
1:1:52|1:1:55|It is generally believed that a third party will only destroy others' happiness.
1:1:58|1:2:0|The so-called free love.
1:2:33|1:2:44|Xiao Jiang hurriedly ran towards Su Qing and grabbed his arm.
1:2:44|1:2:48|[Su Qing] looked at Teacher [Xiao Jiang] with a strange affection in her eyes.
1:2:48|1:2:54|Xiao Jiang, unaware, spat out the cigarette in his mouth, stared at Su Qing's eyes with wide eyes.
1:3:37|1:3:44|Without waiting for [Xiao Jiang] to react, [Su Qing] twisted his shoulder and attached her lips to his, leaving [Xiao Jiang] dumbfounded on the spot.
1:4:16|1:4:20|After receiving a satisfactory answer, she smiled contentedly and walked away.
1:4:20|1:4:27|After a long time, Teacher [Xiao Jiang] finally reacted. She looked at the departing figure of [Su Qing] and felt a sense of reluctance for the first time.
1:6:6|1:6:16|While [K-1] was dealing with Song Mei outside the house, [Su Qing] sneaked into Xu Dachun's room. Xu Dachun was sitting on a stool with his head tilted at that moment, which made Su Qing couldn't help but take a few steps closer.
1:6:17|1:6:23|At the moment when [Su Qing] turned her head, [Xu Dachun]'s head popped out two meters high directly from his neck.
1:6:44|1:6:48|[Su Mei] opened the door and saw Teacher [Xiao Jiang] outside.
1:6:48|1:6:53|He laughed heartily, showing a mouthful of broken teeth, his eyes almost bulging out.
1:6:53|1:6:58|Upon seeing [Su Mei] approaching, Teacher [Xiao Jiang] pushed aside her long hair, held her face, and kissed her.
1:7:4|1:7:14|[K-88] excitedly crossed his eyes and gestured for [Xiao Jiang] to enter the room, then shyly went upstairs.
1:7:21|1:7:26|Previously, [Su Qing] excitedly pushed open [Xu Dachun]'s door, only to find him missing.
1:7:26|1:7:29|At this moment, [Xu Dachun] is hiding in the kitchen activating the mimicry program.
1:7:29|1:7:34|He picked up a pair of pliers and examined them, the next second, his head turned into pliers.
1:7:34|1:7:44|Later, he picked up a can of preserved fish, and just as [Xiao Jiang] walked into the kitchen with light steps, what she saw was [Xu Dachun] with a huge can on his neck.
1:7:51|1:8:0|The mastermind [Xu Dachun] sat on the balcony flipping through a book as if nothing had happened.
1:8:0|1:8:12|[Su Qing] went out, and the weak [Xiao Jiang] teacher looked out at the balcony, while at this moment, [Xu Dachun] was scanning the baby's bottom in the magazine.
1:8:12|1:8:14|The balcony door opens, revealing a person.
1:8:17|1:8:21|When [Su Qing] rushed into the room, Teacher [Xiao Jiang] fainted again.
1:8:29|1:8:33|[Xiao Jiang] frowned, covered his head that was hit, and struggled to sit up.
1:8:46|1:8:54|With a cough, Xu Dachun's eyeballs popped out.
1:8:54|1:9:8|[Xu Dachun] calmly pushed his eyeball back into its socket, then scanned the green plants across from him again, turning his head into a few leaves.
1:9:12|1:9:20|[K-1] lowered his gaze, a look of panic flashed across his usually expressionless face, and even his pupils uncontrollably contracted.
1:9:49|1:9:52|[K-1] twitched at the corner of his mouth, speaking with great difficulty.
1:9:52|1:10:0|Assuming [Su Mei] got a satisfactory answer, she had a shy and satisfied look on her face like a little girl.
1:10:13|1:10:17|[K-1] showed an awkward smile, and wisps of smoke emerged from behind his head.
1:10:23|1:10:28|[K-1] conceals a few cigarettes, the cigarette butt sparks as the wind blows, and even his backside catches fire.
1:10:39|1:10:42|[K-1] collapsed and let out a loud roar, and his physical malfunction disappeared immediately.
1:10:58|1:11:8|[Su Mei] smiled bitterly, messed up her hair into a mess, and walked away swaying her arms. [K-1] clenched his fists in frustration, looking helplessly and heartbrokenly at [Su Mei]'s back.
1:11:8|1:11:18|At night, [Xu Dachun] curled up in his small bed sleeping soundly, while [K-1], bathed in moonlight, sat slouched in the charging chair, looking disheveled.
1:11:48|1:11:53|The scene of that night is still vivid, but [Xu Dachun] will never come back again.
1:11:53|1:12:1|[K-1], alone, walked through the streets and alleys that he once walked with [Xu Dachun]. The doors were tightly closed here, no longer bustling as they used to be.
1:12:12|1:12:23|Song lifted his tattooed eyebrows and saw the message sent by [K-1] on the screen. [K-1] sincerely expressed that if what he said yesterday had upset Song, he wanted to apologize.
1:12:23|1:12:32|Song Mei pursed her lips, dropped the newspaper in her hand, and started typing on the keyboard clatteringly, telling [K-1] that he was overthinking, and she was not actually angry.
1:12:34|1:12:41|[Su Mei] stared at the screen for several seconds, pretending to be indifferent, and replied stubbornly.
1:12:44|1:12:51|And the next sentence from [K-1] instantly stumped [Su Mei], causing even her hands resting on the keyboard to be withdrawn, as the screen displayed a questioning look.
1:12:53|1:13:6|[Su Mei] stared at the screen for a long time, not knowing how to reply. Her hands were nervously folded together as she sat on the stairs next to [K-1], completely ignoring the noisy environment. [K-1] was focused on the computer screen, waiting patiently for a response from [Su Mei].
1:13:6|1:13:11|In the end, as a robot, [K-1] couldn't control his inner feelings for the first time, speaking word by word.
1:13:59|1:14:6|As a robot, K-1 doesn't have any fancy decorations, but it is this sincere language that is most precious.
1:14:6|1:14:15|[Su Mei] stared at the screen, her eyes gradually turning red, tears shimmering. She closed her eyes, took a deep breath to calm herself, and then asked the final soul-piercing question.
1:14:16|1:14:25|K-1 stared at the screen in front of him without moving, like a statue. Only the slightly dilated pupils silently interpreted the struggle in his heart at this moment.
1:14:29|1:14:39|Colleagues around them did not sense the undercurrent between the two, and even teased them.
1:14:39|1:14:42|Upon seeing [Lin Xiang], the expression on [K-1]'s face immediately darkened.
1:16:0|1:16:15|[Lin Xiang] turned around and saw [Xu Dachun]'s head bouncing off his neck, which scared him so much that he fainted directly. Two men in black heard the noise and immediately rushed into the office.
1:16:15|1:16:19|The man in black nodded, dropped Lin Xiang and ran away. Su Mei, unaware, quickly dialed the phone.
1:16:58|1:17:6|The workers at Matou are currently being chased by thugs, while the two black-clad men brought by [Lin Xiang] are calmly surrounding them from both sides.
1:17:6|1:17:9|[Xu Dachun] blocked [K-1] with his hand and took a few steps forward.
1:17:15|1:17:21|Obviously, the man in black was not pleased, he threw a shoe at [Xu Dachun]'s face, and then turned to attack [K-1].
1:17:21|1:17:28|The man in black on the left extended his hand, and a powerful airflow rushed towards [K-1], causing [K-1] to uncontrollably fly in his direction.
1:17:28|1:17:34|[K-1], unable to break free with one hand, raised his right fist to prepare for an attack, but at this moment, the black-clothed person on his right also made a move.
1:17:35|1:17:42|[K-1] sucked in his right fist, caught between two air currents, leaving him suspended in mid-air with his mouth wide open, unable to break free.
1:17:42|1:17:54|The men in black gathered and struck in unison, one grabbing [K-1]'s arm while the other palm struck his temple, erasing all memories related to [Lin Xiang] and Tian'an from [K-1]'s mind in an instant.
1:17:54|1:17:57|Xu Dachun's memory is fading fast.
1:17:57|1:18:7|While erasing the memories related to [Su Mei], [K-1] became furious. He struggled desperately and, with his own strength, managed to stop the operation of the brain deletion system, leaving the men in black astonished.
1:18:7|1:18:15|But despite [K-1]'s struggles, he still couldn't break free from the grip of the men in black, and could only forcibly preserve all memories related to [Su Mei].
1:18:15|1:18:26|The man in black, seeing this, immediately increased the power output. [Xu Dachun] couldn't hold back any longer, raised his fist and rushed forward. Before he even got close, he was punched by the man in black and sent flying into the air.
1:18:26|1:18:33|As he fell to the ground, electricity flickered around him, accompanied by terrifying black smoke, directly knocking three people away.
1:18:33|1:18:39|[K-1] was shocked to see that the face in front of him was no longer that of [Xu Dachun], but the long-discarded [K-88].
1:18:39|1:18:45|He still wore that arrogant smile, smoothly demonstrating a set of boxing techniques, provoking the black-clothed man with his empty hands.
1:18:54|1:18:59|The two men in black still had expressionless faces, obviously not taking [K-88] seriously.
1:18:59|1:19:11|However, at the moment when the man in black reached out, [K-88] held his hand in the air, pulled and pushed, without touching the body of the man in black at all, but directly sent him flying, with [K-88]'s hands wrapped in a black mist.
1:19:12|1:19:18|Whenever the black-clothed person is hit, sparks will burst out, and no matter how the black-clothed person strikes, it will be blocked by the black mist.
1:19:18|1:19:28|Shortly after, [K-88] leaped into the air, splitting the black-clothed man in front of him with a palm strike. He then turned around, bent his waist to dodge another person's fist, and took the opportunity to strike him with a palm as well.
1:19:28|1:19:31|The man in black, unwilling to show weakness, raised his right palm again and used the Shadow Hand technique.
1:19:31|1:19:38|[K-88], calm and composed despite facing off with him, was suddenly attacked from behind by another person in black who raised his palm in perfect coordination.
1:19:39|1:19:52|[K-88] made a Tai Chi move, sending both of them flying out with his power.
1:19:52|1:19:59|[K-1] saw [K-88] transform back into [Xu Dachun], grabbed him and ran forward, while the two men in black followed closely behind.
1:19:59|1:20:2|Soon, the two arrived at a dilapidated cabin.
1:20:12|1:20:27|After a loud noise, [K-1] alertly raised his head, only to see the ship compartment, which had been dismantled into several sections, miraculously merging back together. The compartment instantly plunged into darkness, with the only exit behind also forcibly sealed shut, completely forming an enclosed space.
1:20:27|1:20:33|The cabin the size of a football field is filled with old metal parts, and at this moment, it is unexpectedly restless, trembling.
1:20:33|1:20:40|In the horrified gaze of [Xu Dachun], screws of all sizes in the cabin twisted and fell off on their own, being sucked into the air by a huge force.
1:20:41|1:20:50|Soon, the steel pipes on the wrists, the iron sheets on the abdomen, and even the iron hooks and anchors without cargo curtains were all dragging on the ground, struggling to fly upwards.
1:20:50|1:20:56|As the metal structure [K-1] and [Xu Dachun] stood in place, struggling to support, [Xu Dachun]'s phone was also sucked away.
1:20:56|1:21:1|[Xu Dachun] hurriedly ran a few steps forward, trying to retrieve his phone, but almost got sucked in himself.
1:21:2|1:21:13|[K-1] tightly grabbed [Xu Dachun]'s arm, then skillfully dodged the huge crane flying towards them from behind. In the blink of an eye, all the metal components inside the cabin were sucked in and spun around in the massive storm.
1:21:13|1:21:31|They pieced it together on their own, and soon assembled a giant robot almost as tall as the cabin. The crane that was sucked away transformed into the top cockpit, equipped with complete brakes and throttle. The feet of the black-clothed men were placed on top, and the twin barrels of the arms were like thunder, with enough firepower to destroy the world.
1:21:32|1:21:43|The robot turned to face the two, with [K-1] and [Xu Dachun] in front of them like two ignorant ants. The acrobat controlled his body's movements, roaring a challenge at the two.
1:21:54|1:22:4|[K-88] didn't pay much attention to the words. After watching [K-1] leave, he looked up at the imposing figure in front of him. Even through the glass window, he could feel the provoking gaze from the other person.
1:22:4|1:22:16|[K-1] had just stepped aside, preparing to launch an attack, when he saw [K-88] already holding a long knife in his hand. He swung it wildly, and soon a vortex wrapped in flames appeared. Even the men in black couldn't help but dodge into their bodies.
1:22:16|1:22:23|Finally, [K-88] and his long knife merged into one, turning into a huge fireball, smashing the robot's arm into pieces.
1:22:25|1:22:35|The man in black chuckled, pressed the button in front of him, and the scattered parts miraculously reassembled. He even clapped his hands together as if swatting a mosquito, and [K-88] was crushed once again.
1:22:35|1:22:40|[K-1] rushed up to provide support when he saw the situation was not good, but unexpectedly, he was slapped away by the robot.
1:22:40|1:22:46|At this moment, [K-88] has ascended to the front of the robot, raising his long knife, ready to perform his ultimate skill.
1:22:46|1:22:57|Who knew, the man in black took the opportunity to manipulate the mechanical arm, grabbed the long knife, and extended numerous tentacles with blades attached, activating a strong electric current. [K-88] was momentarily unable to break free, his face wiped clean by the electricity.
1:22:57|1:23:4|And [K-1], upon seeing this scene, suddenly came up with a great idea.
1:23:4|1:23:10|At this moment, [K-88] has broken free from the electric shock and is being chased by the robot, while [K-1] opens the electronic screen.
1:23:24|1:23:31|[K-1] ignores [K-88] and focuses on searching for the virus, while [K-88] continues to shoulder the responsibility of diverting the robots.
1:23:31|1:23:39|The robot wrapped [K-88] in a light ball, rolled it in its hand a few times, and then sent it flying, hitting [K-1] who was searching for the virus once again.
1:23:40|1:23:43|[K-1] looked at the screen in astonishment, only to see the virus sent successfully, named Brotherhood 7314.
1:24:4|1:24:10|Suddenly, a dozen martial arts disciples appeared behind [K-88].
1:24:10|1:24:17|The good times didn't last long, as more than ten people were all subdued with just one move.
1:24:23|1:24:29|Witnessing [K-88] continuously summoning people holding weapons, [K-1] standing on the side was dumbfounded.
1:24:29|1:24:41|Before long, the people summoned by [K-88] occupied half of the cabin space. Everyone raised their weapons and charged forward without fear, while the men in black continued to smirk relentlessly, even leisurely lighting a cigarette.
1:24:41|1:24:59|But when everyone surrounded the robot aggressively, the man in black calmly gripped the handle of the scope. He controlled the robot and aimed the barrel of the gun at the densest part of the crowd. [K-1] looked at the dazzling light flashing on the barrel, couldn't help but be surprised, while the group of people still rushed forward without hesitation.
1:24:59|1:25:5|Soon after, [K-1] repeatedly pressed the switch, and the bullets seemed to be spraying like there was no tomorrow.
1:25:5|1:25:12|The shape of these bullets is very unique, like iron palms. Once they hit a human, they will transform into a sealed rectangular cage.
1:25:12|1:25:27|In the blink of an eye, the people summoned by [K-88] have been killed or injured, leaving only him jumping around in anger, dodging attacks. [K-1] frantically manipulated the joystick, almost in a frenzy, but even after firing bullets, he couldn't capture [K-88].
1:25:27|1:25:34|While the robot was activating its new weapon, [K-88] attempted to summon again, this time a row of hackers dressed in black with sunglasses.
1:25:44|1:25:50|[K-88] desperately summons, calling forth a row of young women in fur coats, wielding machetes.
1:25:50|1:25:54|Watching this group of people fearlessly facing death, [K-88] raised his arm again.
1:26:2|1:26:8|[K-1] had just finished speaking when [K-88]'s eyes started rolling uncontrollably, and smoke came out of his mouth.
1:26:8|1:26:17|At this moment, the robot has already controlled all the people summoned by [K-88] in the cage, aimed at him, and began to reload bullets after helping up his arm.
1:26:17|1:26:24|[K-1] is powerless in the face of this sudden thick fog, only able to flee in embarrassment, while the robot, fully loaded with bullets, roars and scans the area below.
1:26:25|1:26:36|No one was reflected in the mirror at this moment. When the black-clad man saw [K-88] constantly agitated by the electric currents all over his body, he did not hide his inner madness. He raised the corners of his mouth and pressed another button.
1:26:36|1:26:45|But at this moment, the robot showed no response at all. Instead, thick smoke billowed from the control panel, causing the black-clothed man's expression to freeze instantly. He stood up in disbelief and looked down below.
1:26:46|1:26:51|The saw slowly cuts open a slit in the rectangular cage, sparking sharp sparks.
1:26:51|1:27:0|Another man in black couldn't sit still either, he also leaned over to look down, only to see a flash of light in the center of the cage, the door opened, and the hackers came out in a shadow.
1:27:0|1:27:4|Various people summoned by [K-88] began to pry open the cages that imprisoned them.
1:27:5|1:27:11|They stood in front of the men in black, firing grappling hooks at him simultaneously, firmly locking him in place.
1:27:11|1:27:17|The man in black, seeing the situation, immediately sat down and began to control the robot, hoping to break free from the restraints.
1:27:17|1:27:22|However, two fists are no match for four hands, as the man in black even pulled off the steering wheel, but it didn't change anything.
1:27:22|1:27:31|The dashboard kept flashing warnings, and at the same time, the robot's wires connecting to its head were all torn off due to excessive twisting.
1:27:31|1:27:34|In the end, [K-88] ran out of energy and took the lead in blocking the attack.
1:27:35|1:27:39|At the same moment, the powerful body of the robot also collapsed to the ground.
1:27:39|1:27:43|[K-1] dared to peek out from the corner to observe the situation of [Xu Dachun].
1:27:43|1:27:48|People summoned by [K-88] climbed menacingly into the cockpit of the robot.
1:27:52|1:28:0|Afterwards, he wielded his weapon again and delivered a series of blows to the robot's body.
1:28:0|1:28:16|At this moment, [K-88] was in a very bad condition, lying weakly on the ground, his body twitching continuously. The Jianghu loyalty 7314 he received also stopped operating, with only a soft light flashing across the cabin. The people who were still dismantling the robots disappeared in an instant without a trace.
1:28:16|1:28:18|[K-1] hurriedly embraced [K-88] in his arms.
1:28:26|1:28:32|[K-88] eyes shimmered with tears as he looked at [K-1].
1:28:44|1:28:51|[K-88] hoped to get a satisfactory answer, he looked at [K-1] with a strange gaze, but in the end, he never got it.
1:28:51|1:28:59|[K-1] couldn't hide the pain on his face, trembling as he held [K-88] in his arms, showing his reluctance to let go.
1:28:59|1:29:6|After finally managing to digest his emotions, [K-1] let go of [K-88], only to see [Xu Dachun] back on [K-88]'s face.
1:29:20|1:29:23|At this moment, a police car drifts stylishly around the bend.
1:29:23|1:29:25|Approaching the dock.
1:29:25|1:29:27|[K-1] also escaped the cabin with [Xu Dachun].
1:29:28|1:29:32|Seeing the radiant smile of [Su Mei], [K-1]'s heart couldn't calm down.
1:29:32|1:29:36|Night fell quickly, and everyone gathered at the factory once again.
1:30:1|1:30:8|[Su Qing] impatiently points at Teacher [Xiao Jiang], who obediently squats aside, while [Xu Dachun] looks at the approaching [Su Mei] and guiltily turns his head away.
1:31:37|1:31:43|[Su Mei] looked at the scene in front of her in disbelief, took a few steps back, and finally bumped into [K-1]'s chest.
1:31:43|1:31:47|[K-1] did not dodge, but gently grabbed [Su Mei]'s shoulder.
1:31:47|1:31:50|[Su Mei] seemed determined, turning to look at [K-1].
1:31:50|1:31:56|However, at the moment he saw the expression on [K-1]'s face, he understood everything. He realized that [K-1] was indeed a robot.
1:31:58|1:32:0|What decision will [K-1] make next.
1:32:0|1:32:8|[K-1] looked at the tearful [Su Mei] with deep reluctance in his heart, but he ultimately just glanced at [Su Mei] before resolutely walking away.
1:32:8|1:32:15|From this moment on, he is no longer a cold machine, but becomes a person with responsibility and thoughts.
1:32:15|1:32:18|Soon, [K-1] arrived outside the factory to confront his ultimate enemy.
1:32:19|1:32:34|[Lin Xiang] walked solemnly in the front, wrapped in a black coat, with eight black-clad men on either side. Behind him, there was a monstrous creature resembling a tank, towering as tall as a bow, exuding the aura of a sage. His cold eyes contained a hint of murderous intent.
1:32:38|1:32:46|Seeing [K-1] rushing over, [Lin Xiang] was initially very disdainful, but when he saw him transform into a robot, [Lin Xiang] finally took him seriously.
1:32:46|1:32:52|[K-1] hovered in the air, struck a fighting pose towards the steel monster, but couldn't help glancing down for a moment.
1:32:52|1:32:57|At this moment, [Su Mei] looked up into the air, with a look of not only shock but also a hint of worry on her face.
1:32:57|1:33:3|The steel monster suddenly began to transform, lifting up its top and extending two powerful mechanical legs from the middle of its body.
1:33:4|1:33:16|At the same time, covered all over with small gun barrels, with two missile launchers extending from the top of the barrels on the arms, and two rows of rocket launchers on the chest, all the gun barrels are neatly aimed at [K-1].
1:33:16|1:33:27|However, the ultimate weapon of the high-speed rail monster is still behind it. There is a huge platform on its back, covered with densely packed rocket missiles, totaling over a hundred. This power is enough to annihilate K-1.
1:33:34|1:33:39|[Xu Dachun] looked up and comforted Party, [K-1] glanced at [Xu Dachun], then turned to look at [Su Mei].
1:33:39|1:33:53|At this moment, [Su Mei] had calmed down, looking quietly at him as [K-1] transformed back from robot form to human form.
1:33:53|1:34:0|Everyone turned around to see Teacher [Xiao Jiang] wearing a helmet, a flashing light on his chest, and holding two tasers in his hands.
1:34:14|1:34:23|[Xiao Jiang] opened the mini calculator on his arm, sending a current of electricity back and forth on the drill bit, stunning it.
1:34:54|1:34:58|[K-1] seemed to have his heart ripped out, his knees went weak and he fell to the ground.
1:34:58|1:35:3|Witnessing this scene, [Su Mei]'s strong heart collapsed in an instant, and she ran frantically towards [K-1].
1:35:3|1:35:13|Xu Dachun stood calmly in front of the men in black, apparently having made a decision, while Lin Xiang slowly approached K-1 and looked down at him from a higher vantage point.
1:35:18|1:35:22|[K-1] absentmindedly raised his head and looked at [Lin Xiang] with eyes full of despair.
1:35:24|1:35:27|Tears glistened in his eyes as he whispered in compromise.
1:35:31|1:35:41|Watching the once proud high-tech being used so humbly for humanity, [Xu Dachun]'s cold eyes showed a hint of dissatisfaction, but in the end he turned away, as if acquiescing.
1:35:41|1:35:45|[K-1] lowered his head, silently stood up, and took the lead in walking towards [Xu Dachun].
1:35:45|1:35:51|Although men are not supposed to shed tears easily, when [K-1] stood in front of [Xu Dachun], tears were already welling up in his eyes.
1:36:30|1:36:44|[Xu Dachun] didn't mind, still looking earnestly at [K-1]. [K-1] was touched by this belated understanding, lowering his head and crying like a child. In the distance, [Lin Xiang] turned his head, casting a cold glance at the sobbing [K-1].
1:36:44|1:36:52|As a human and the creator of [K-1], [Lin Xiang] simply cannot understand why the robot he personally trained has turned into what it is now.
1:36:52|1:37:1|After a long while, [K-1] finally calmed down. He nodded at [Xu Dachun] before turning around and walking away slowly and steadily.
1:37:1|1:37:5|It seems like they are experiencing the true touch of this vast land.
1:37:9|1:37:14|Under the gaze of the crowd, [K-1]'s steps slowly came to a halt in front of [Su Mei].
1:37:14|1:37:20|[Su Mei] looked at her beloved one, with a glint in her eyes, while the slightly furrowed brows silently conveyed his heartache.
1:37:20|1:37:25|The two of them just stared at each other quietly, neither speaking first.
1:37:25|1:37:29|Finally, all the attachments of [K-1] turned into tears overflowing from the eyes, barely curling up the corners of the mouth.
1:37:54|1:38:0|Su Mei's tears welled up in her eyes as she stared at K-1, her pursed lips seemingly holding endless grievances.
1:38:0|1:38:5|[K-1] lowered his head silently, folded his hands, and then presented a bunch of gorgeous roses.
1:38:5|1:38:10|These roses seem to have a life of their own, growing continuously in the hands of [K-1], almost overflowing.
1:38:10|1:38:16|She looked at the rose in her hand, showing the most sincere smile, and held out her hands to [Su Mei].
1:38:16|1:38:22|[Su Mei] smiled through tears, reaching out her hands as [K-1] placed all the roses into her palms.
1:38:22|1:38:26|From this moment on, their hearts were tightly pressed together.
1:38:26|1:38:32|Su Mei finally understood K-1's intentions, and K-1 no longer needed to worry about doing things against his heart in violation of the rules.
1:38:32|1:38:38|[K-1] looked at the girl in front of him with deep affection, and gently leaned in to whisper something in her ear.
1:38:38|1:38:44|Su Mei burst into tears instantly, but also smiled with joy, saying the long-lost words "I love you."
1:38:44|1:38:50|However, after the heartfelt confession, [K-1] made the final and most cruel decision to end his own life.
1:38:53|1:38:59|Whenever [Su Mei] comes to her senses from joy, she turns [K-1]'s body into diamond-like particles bit by bit.
1:38:59|1:39:6|[Su Mei] dropped all the roses in her hand on the ground, she knelt down in despair, trying to gather the pieces back together.
1:39:6|1:39:11|However, the fragments transformed into twinkling stars in the air, and then disappeared.
1:39:26|1:39:33|The memories buried deep inside [Xu Dachun] suddenly surged to her mind, bringing tears to her eyes.
1:39:33|1:39:40|And at this moment, [Su Mei] knelt on the ground, looking around in a daze, trying to find the figure of [K-1].
1:39:40|1:39:44|However, apart from the roses scattered all over the floor, she didn't leave a single thing behind.
1:39:44|1:39:49|In the end, [Su Mei] wept in despair under everyone's gaze, until she fainted.
1:39:49|1:39:59|[Xu Dachun] voluntarily followed [Lin Xiang] back to the research institute to contribute to the new technology of combining humans and robots, developing a super robot to serve society.
