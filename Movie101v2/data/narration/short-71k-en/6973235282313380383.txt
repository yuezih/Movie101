0:6:43|0:7:12|The film begins with a shot of a mobile phone, with the screen showing a call to [Yan Shouyi]. The scene then shifts to [Yan Shouyi]'s home, where his wife [Yu Wenjuan] is mopping the floor by the doorway. [Yan Shouyi]'s phone is placed on the shoe cabinet. Suddenly, the phone rings, and [Yu Wenjuan], hearing the sound, puts down the mop, wipes the sweat off her face, and walks over.
0:7:13|0:7:18|She picked up the phone, and a voice of impatience came from the other end,
0:7:24|0:7:39|As soon as the call ended, the other party hung up. [Yu Wenjuan] slowly put down her phone, looking thoughtfully at the screen. A car was driving and stopped in front of a toll station.
0:7:39|0:7:44|[Fei Mo] sat in the passenger seat and said to [Yan Shouyi]:
0:8:6|0:8:10|The two of them drove forward in silence, heading towards the toll booth.
0:8:26|0:8:38|[Yan Shouyi] thought for a moment and then started the car to continue driving. But after a few steps, [Yan Shouyi] felt uneasy again. He parked the car on the side of the road, put his hand on the steering wheel, and said after some contemplation:
0:9:7|0:9:23|It was drizzling lightly in the sky. [Yan Shouyi] drove back home, parked the car downstairs, and entered the house cautiously. He closed the door, looked around the room, and then walked straight to the shoe cabinet.
0:9:24|0:9:36|He glanced at his phone and saw that [Wu Yue] had called, his face immediately showing a hint of unease. He then put the phone in his pocket and walked into the house.
0:9:43|0:10:6|[Yan Shouyi] deliberately pretended not to know and turned around. He took out his phone and glanced at it, saying, "Once [Yan Shouyi] opened the door and went out, [Yu Wenjuan] stood still in place without moving. The scene then shifted to the studio of a talk show, where the lights gradually brightened."
0:12:31|0:12:36|Shen Xue snatched Yan Shouyi's phone and threw it into the trash can.
0:12:44|0:12:56|Shen Xue looked at Yan Shouyi without saying a word, then threw the pen heavily on the table, as she walked towards the door while speaking.
0:13:5|0:13:11|Everyone stood up and left their seats. Someone in the classroom couldn't bear it anymore and said to [Yan Shouyi]:
0:13:16|0:13:38|[Yan Shouyi] lowered his head in embarrassment upon hearing this, leaving only [Yan Shouyi] in the classroom for a moment. [Shen Xue]'s coat was placed on the front seat, and she walked angrily towards the platform to tidy up the lesson plans. [Yan Shouyi] stood up and walked over, whispering to [Shen Xue]:
0:14:1|0:14:19|[Yan Shouyi] stuffed [Shen Xue]'s coat and inspection together into [Shen Xue]'s hands. At night, beside the road, there was [Yan Shouyi]'s car parked in a small grove, with [Yan Shouyi] and Wu Yue inside.
0:14:19|0:14:30|In the dim light, with cars passing by occasionally, [Yan Shouyi] holds some clothes in his hand and looks anxious as he lifts himself up from the seat, saying, "Wu Yue's arm slipped off his shoulder."
0:14:30|0:14:39|He looked at the passing vehicles outside the car window, feeling uneasy, he wiped his mouth and turned to look at Yan Shouyi, saying:
0:14:58|0:15:9|Wu Yue bit [Yan Shouyi]'s back.
0:15:17|0:15:43|Wu Yue stopped, suddenly pulled out the car key, threw it outside, closed the door and looked at [Yan Shouyi] with a twisted face. [Yan Shouyi] helplessly looked at her without saying a word. Wu Yue tidied her hair in the car, so [Yan Shouyi] had to get out of the car to find the key. At this moment, the phone suddenly rang, [Yan Shouyi] had to answer the call, and Wu Yue pushed open the car door and walked out.
0:16:29|0:16:35|The scene cuts to the home of [Yan Shouyi],
0:16:37|0:16:43|Yu Wenjuan sat on the sofa, soaking her feet and watching TV, when the phone rang. She picked up the phone,
0:17:51|0:17:57|Yu Wenjuan hung up the phone and dialed [Yan Shouyi]'s number. A dial tone came from the other end of the line.
0:18:2|0:18:12|Yu Wenjuan held the phone thoughtfully. The scene shifted to [Fei Mo] and his wife walking their dogs in the neighborhood, with their dog playing with the neighbor's dog.
0:18:36|0:19:13|Fei Mo's smile froze on his face, looking serious. Yu Wenjuan suddenly stood up, walked out from the foot bath with wet feet, went to the balcony to look outside the window. She then walked restlessly in the room. On the other side, Fei Mo, worried about Yan Shouyi, called him. At that moment, Yan Shouyi was driving home, holding the steering wheel with his left hand, picking up his phone with his right hand, opening it, then opening the car window and sunroof for ventilation. The cold wind blew in instantly.
0:19:13|0:19:33|[Yan Shouyi] shivered from the cold, quickly flipping the hood of his coat up over his head. He picked up his phone and made a call, glancing ahead before placing the phone on the seat next to him. At that moment, he heard Wu Yue's voice coming from the phone.
0:19:54|0:20:12|He hung up the phone with a smile, and the scene shifted to outside his house. He reversed the car into the parking space, parked it properly, but at this moment he still didn't know that his lie had been exposed, and he didn't know that his wife at home had started to suspect him. He pushed open the car door, ready to get out, when suddenly he remembered something.
0:20:12|0:20:41|Back in the car, he looked around, closed the door, took out his phone and deleted the call records with Wu Yue. Then, [Yan Shouyi] pushed open the door of the corridor and walked in. He stopped again, looked nervously towards the house, hesitated for a moment, reached out to unzip his jacket, lowered his head and stuck his head inside the jacket, carefully sniffed. His eyes moved slightly, then he calmed down.
0:20:43|0:20:51|Returning home, [Yan Shouyi] pushed the door open and walked in, closing the door behind him. He went straight to the shoe cabinet, changing his shoes while looking around the room.
0:20:53|0:21:2|Yu Wenjuan asked him calmly when she heard the noise in the room.
0:21:11|0:21:26|Yu Wenjuan sat on the sofa watching [Yan Shouyi]. She turned off the TV and stood up, walking towards [Yan Shouyi]. [Yan Shouyi] was lying on the bed wearing a coat. When he saw his wife, he immediately got up. Yu Wenjuan approached and hugged him, saying:
0:21:57|0:22:7|[Yan Shouyi] looked at his wife in a daze,
0:22:18|0:22:27|Yu Wenjuan stubbornly reached out her hand, making [Yan Shouyi] feel guilty. Yu Wenjuan started to get impatient, but still pretended to be calm as she handed the phone to his wife.
0:22:37|0:22:44|Yu Wenjuan hung up the phone, staring at [Yan Shouyi], who remained silent and looked away. Just then, the phone rang again.
0:22:45|0:23:19|Yu Wenjuan opened her phone, and Wu Yue sent a message saying: "Don't take off your underwear when you sleep." Yu Wenjuan slowly raised her head, [Yan Shouyi] avoided her gaze. Yu Wenjuan handed the phone to [Yan Shouyi] for him to read it himself. [Yan Shouyi] closed the phone without saying a word. He glanced at Yu Wenjuan and then lowered his head again. Reluctantly, he shifted his body and slowly walked towards the sofa.
0:23:19|0:23:25|He took off his T-shirt, and Yan Shouyi, holding back tears, walked towards him.
0:23:26|0:23:41|[Yan Shouyi] threw the clothes he had taken off onto the sofa, glanced back at his wife, now with only a short-sleeved shirt on. He slowly pulled out the hem of the shirt tucked into his pants.
0:23:41|0:23:48|Acting as slow as a child who has done something wrong. His wife is watching him from behind. 
0:23:48|0:23:57|[Yan Shouyi] stripped himself clean, standing motionless with his upper body bare. Yu Wenjuan looked at [Yan Shouyi]'s shoulders and immediately welled up with tears.
0:23:57|0:24:2|There was a clear bite mark left on the shoulder by Wuyue.
0:24:3|0:24:8|Even though she had already guessed the outcome, Yan Shouyi could not face the reality at this moment.
0:24:9|0:24:15|She cried with her head down leaning on [Yan Shouyi]'s shoulder, then covered her eyes and left, [Yan Shouyi] got divorced.
0:25:0|0:25:15|After the short training session, everyone took a group photo together. Amidst the laughter and joy, a train slowly passed by. [Yan Shouyi], [Shen Xue], and [Fei Mo] sat inside the train chatting.
0:26:53|0:27:2|[Shen Xue] glanced at [Yan Shouyi], who smiled but remained silent, then turned his head towards the window.
0:27:22|0:27:34|[Fei Mo] paused for a moment and slowly said:
0:28:4|0:28:20|Brick Brother was putting money into his jacket pocket while talking, when suddenly his phone rang. He took out the phone and pulled out the antenna, leaving [Yan Shouyi] looking at him with an incredulous expression.
0:30:57|0:31:1|[Shen Xue] took the wine glass handed to her, frowned, and drank it down.
0:31:23|0:31:31|[Shen Xue] drinks it all in one gulp, lowering her head and grimacing.
0:32:18|0:32:54|Shen Xue collapsed on the chair, while Yan Shouyi was eating noodles next to her. In the evening, a room was lit up, and grandma slowly opened a ring box, revealing a jade ring inside. Yan Shouyi nodded while sitting across from her, but dared not to look up. Grandma, angry, spoke with a heavier tone, and placed the ring in front of Yan Shouyi, saying:
0:32:58|0:33:23|Grandma choked up a bit, [Yan Shouyi] nodded incessantly. Slowly, Grandma picked up the cane beside her and looked at [Yan Shouyi]. She extended the cane towards his chest, her voice trembling. [Yan Shouyi] was poked down onto the kang by Grandma's cane. Then he slowly got up and buried his head deeper. The village was quiet at night, with a few farmhouses' lights flickering.
0:34:50|0:35:14|At this moment, the phone next to [Fei Mo] rang again. [Yan Shouyi] took the notebook from his colleague and sat next to [Fei Mo]. After the female colleague finished the call and returned, [Yan Shouyi] gestured for her to sit across from them.
0:35:28|0:35:45|[Fei Mo] looked gloomy and displeased, and [Yan Shouyi] teased him upon seeing this.
0:36:25|0:36:36|[Yan Shouyi] grabbed [Fei Mo], who was trying to get up in anger, and pushed him back onto the sofa.
0:38:17|0:38:30|[Yan Shouyi] looked outside and turned to [Wu Yue], saying, "[Wu Yue] wiped the water from washing her hands on [Yan Shouyi]'s pants."
0:38:46|0:39:0|Wu Yue stood up and Yan Shouyi also stood up. He walked to the door and said to the outside. He casually closed the door and returned to his original seat.
0:39:39|0:39:46|The scene shifts, two female students walk through the dormitory corridor laughing and joking,
0:39:53|0:40:21|Upon seeing [Shen Xue], the two immediately quieted down and returned to the dormitory. [Shen Xue] held a flashlight to inspect the dormitory, pushing open a door and walking in. She used the flashlight to check each bed, all of which were empty, until she finally found a girl on the top bunk. The light from the flashlight woke the girl up, and she sleepily sat up, rubbing her eyes. The light was too bright for her to open her eyes, and [Shen Xue], with a stern face, asked from the ground:
0:41:12|0:41:39|Suddenly, [Yan Shouyi] turned off the light, excitedly pulled [Shen Xue], and then moved two chairs under the window. The two of them stood on the chairs and looked out the window. They saw a car drive to the school gate and stop. A group of girls giggled as they got out of the car, chatting away while putting on their coats. One girl ran to the gate to check the situation first.
0:41:39|0:41:56|Arriving at the school gate only to find it was already late, the rest of them were still dawdling to tidy up their clothes. In the dark night with heavy snowfall, everyone was in chaos. They discussed and decided to start climbing over the wall to enter.
0:42:7|0:42:21|The students who were caught stood in a row, hanging their heads low. [Shen Xue] walked back and forth, not saying a word, using her presence to suppress the students. She slowly approached a girl who was getting closer to her.
0:42:21|0:42:28|The girl quickly dodged backwards upon seeing the situation, then glanced quickly at [Shen Xue]. [Shen Xue] lowered her head and sniffed, then said:
0:42:30|0:42:40|The girl kept her head down and dared not answer. At this moment, Yan Shouyi's phone rang,
0:42:42|0:42:56|Upon hearing the words from the person opposite, [Yan Shouyi] was shocked, he slowly squatted on the ground, widened his eyes, showing an expression of disbelief. In the pitch-black room, [Yan Shouyi]'s face was illuminated by the faint light from the phone.
0:42:56|0:43:3|He fell silent for a moment, then calmly asked: The scene shifts, with [Yan Shouyi] and [Fei Mo] playing with a baby,
0:43:34|0:43:41|Yan Shouyi's attention has been on the baby all along, and finally he speaks:
0:43:44|0:43:50|After he finished speaking, he bent down and kissed the child. In the hospital room, [Fei Mo]'s wife Li Yan was chatting with Yu Wenjuan.
0:43:59|0:44:8|[Fei Mo] pulled over a chair and sat down, gesturing quietly to [Yan Shouyi] to sit down. Li Yan took out a thermos from the side and placed it on the table.
0:44:16|0:44:27|Yu Wenjuan weakly shook her head in refusal. [Yan Shouyi]'s expression was not very natural, while [Fei Mo] cleared his throat.
0:44:52|0:45:25|[Fei Mo] and his wife smiled to themselves, while Yu Wenjuan remained silent. [Yan Shouyi] picked up his briefcase, unzipped it, and after searching for a while, found a ring. He stood up and handed the ring to Yu Wenjuan, but she refused to take it. [Yan Shouyi] had no choice but to place the ring on the table. He then took out a phone box from the bag and set the briefcase aside.
0:45:25|0:45:28|He opened the phone box and handed it to [Yu Wenjuan].
0:45:41|0:46:6|Li Yan looked at [Yan Shouyi], then looked at [Fei Mo] with a pleading look. [Fei Mo] helplessly lowered his eyes to indicate his inability to help. Lin Yan had to take the phone away, and the atmosphere suddenly dropped to freezing point. [Yan Shouyi] sat down, [Fei Mo] cleared his throat, about to speak, when suddenly [Yan Shouyi]'s phone rang. [Fei Mo] looked embarrassed as [Yan Shouyi] answered the phone, it was a call from [Shen Xue].
0:46:48|0:46:54|[Shen Xue] led the bride and groom to toast the guests,
0:48:17|0:48:22|While speaking, [Yan Shouyi] walked into the bedroom and lay on the bed face up.
0:48:33|0:49:7|[Yan Shouyi] fell into a deep sleep and woke up lying on the bed. He opened his sleepy eyes and saw [Shen Xue] tidying up his bag. Closing his eyes, [Yan Shouyi] frowned and sighed in annoyance. "Yan Shouyi" immediately woke up at the words, sat up, looked around, thought for a while, and then collapsed back on the bed, saying:
0:49:15|0:49:34|After saying this, [Shen Xue] suddenly realized something, paused her hand movement, looked at the women's phone on the bed, and stared at [Yan Shouyi] with a suspicious look. She stood up, took the phone and walked around to the head of the bed. She looked down at [Yan Shouyi] from top to bottom and questioned:
0:49:40|0:49:56|[Yan Shouyi] lay on the bed without saying a word. [Shen Xue] threw the phone next to [Yan Shouyi]. After washing his face and coming out of the bathroom, [Yan Shouyi] stood there holding a towel, looking at the angry [Shen Xue] who was sitting on a chair far away with her back towards him.
0:50:46|0:51:0|[Shen Xue] cried out to [Yan Shouyi] with a sobbing voice, [Yan Shouyi] was momentarily stunned, [Yan Shouyi] pretended to explain innocently, while [Shen Xue]'s tears rolled in her eyes,
0:51:0|0:51:7|[Yan Shouyi] panicked and dared not look at [Shen Xue], so he had to lower his head and stare at the towel in his hand. Yu Wenjuan was about to be discharged from the hospital.
0:51:7|0:51:23|[Yan Shouyi] paced back and forth at the hospital entrance. Yu Wenjuan came out holding a child, followed by her brother carrying bags. [Yan Shouyi] immediately opened the car door for them, but Yu Wenjuan walked straight ahead without even looking.
0:51:34|0:51:49|Yan Shouyi's brother ran forward with a suitcase, and at this moment a taxi stopped at the intersection. Yan Shouyi closed his own car door, stood in place, and watched as they got into the taxi.
0:52:5|0:52:13|A small boat docked at the pier, with [Wu Yue] wearing a hat and sunglasses. Behind [Wu Yue] was a woman, both carrying bags as they got off the boat. [Wu Yue] said:
0:52:26|0:52:49|[Wu Yue] brought a girl to a house, pushed the door and walked in. [Wu Yue] sat cross-legged on the bed in the inner room, boredly watching TV. The woman who came with him sat at the table outside, staring at the computer. [Wu Yue] changed several channels until he saw [Yan Shouyi]'s program stop.
0:54:8|0:54:14|The scene changes, with [Yan Shouyi], [Fei Mo], and [Shen Xue] giving each other foot massages.
0:54:59|0:55:11|[Yan Shouyi]'s phone rang, he took it out of his pocket and checked the message. It was from Wu Yue. Yan Shouyi was stunned for a moment, then focused and read Wu Yue's message: "You can deceive me, but I can't deceive you."
0:55:15|0:55:22|I'm in Qingdao, in that same room. You mentioned the green long flow, nonsense. At this moment, [Shen Xue] seemed to sense something.
0:55:22|0:55:29|Picking up his body and starting to drink tea, [Yan Shouyi] glanced at [Shen Xue], then immediately deleted the text message from Wu Yue.
0:55:34|0:55:49|[Yan Shouyi] finally calmed down and put away his phone. He glanced over at [Shen Xue] and saw her looking at him while sipping tea. He tried to cover up by saying:
0:56:4|0:56:12|[Yan Shouyi] glared at [Fei Mo] in annoyance. [Fei Mo] smiled but said nothing. He then glanced at [Shen Xue] and realized she hadn't heard, which put him at ease.
0:56:12|0:56:21|[Yan Shouyi] had just closed his eyes when his phone vibrated in his pocket. He noticed it but pretended not to, while [Fei Mo] also heard it and turned to look at him.
0:56:31|0:56:41|He glanced at his phone, pressed the reject button, and then put it to his ear.
0:56:51|0:57:8|Returning home, [Yan Shouyi] flipped through a newspaper on the coffee table in the living room. He then rolled up his sleeves and walked towards the dining room. As he entered the dining room, he saw a stack of newspapers on the table and continued to search through them. Puzzled, he asked:
0:57:58|0:58:33|Upon entering the restroom, [Yan Shouyi] immediately closed the door, placed the newspaper on the toilet, and sat down. He took out his phone and sneakily glanced outside the door. Putting the phone to his ear, he whispered, " [Shen Xue] suddenly pushed the door open and walked towards the mirror, where she saw [Yan Shouyi] reflected. Startled, she turned around and asked:
0:58:38|0:59:8|[Yan Shouyi] stood up in a panic, dropping his phone on the ground. [Shen Xue] coldly asked, [Yan Shouyi] didn't know how to respond for a moment, he looked down at the phone on the ground. [Shen Xue] walked over and picked up the phone, [Yan Shouyi] fidgeted awkwardly. [Shen Xue] looked at the phone screen in confusion and said, [Yan Shouyi] twisted the toilet handle to cover up his guilt. The two of them went to the living room and sat apart. [Yan Shouyi] covered his face with his hands.
0:59:30|0:59:46|[Yan Shouyi] got up and walked towards [Shen Xue], sitting down beside her. With a smile in his eyes, he looked at [Shen Xue] and said:
1:0:42|1:1:10|The scene shifts, [Yan Shouyi] parks the car on the side of the road, he gets out of the car, followed by a woman from the back seat. The woman, carrying a large backpack, obediently follows behind [Yan Shouyi]. [Yan Shouyi] turns around and says: At this moment, Yu Wenjuan's brother comes out from the door. [Yan Shouyi] says: Yu Wenjuan's brother cautiously glances behind him.
1:1:41|1:1:48|Yan Shouyi nodded thoughtfully as Shen Xue's brother took out a photo and said:
1:2:22|1:2:30|[Yan Shouyi] lowered his head to eat something, then looked up at [Wu Yue] and said:
1:2:35|1:2:49|Wu Yue finished speaking with a serious face, then started eating. At this moment, Yan Shouyi's phone rang. He glanced down at it and said to Wu Yue, "Yan Shouyi is answering the phone." Wu Yue stared at him intently.
1:2:59|1:3:20|[Wu Yue] lowered her head to continue eating. Upon hearing these words, she suddenly looked up at [Yan Shouyi], hung up the phone. [Yan Shouyi] lowered his head to eat, and the two remained silent. With a dark expression, [Wu Yue] said:
1:3:40|1:3:51|[Wu Yue] put down the knife and fork, looked up at him in disbelief, [Yan Shouyi] lowered his head, avoiding [Wu Yue]'s gaze, [Wu Yue] stared at him [Yan Shouyi] without a word, he looked up at [Wu Yue],
1:3:56|1:4:4|[Wu Yue] stubbornly looked at [Yan Shouyi], who remained unmoved. At this moment, [Shen Xue] walked in and looked around.
1:4:49|1:4:55|Wu Yue rubbed Yan Shouyi's foot under the table.
1:4:56|1:5:4|Watching the sweet interaction between the two, [Shen Xue]'s expression became unnatural, but she still politely smiled. After dinner, it was already dark outside.
1:5:4|1:5:15|[Yan Shouyi] is driving on the road, with [Shen Xue] sitting in the passenger seat. Both of them are silent, with [Shen Xue] looking serious and [Yan Shouyi] appearing bewildered.
1:5:15|1:5:22|Yan Shouyi's eyes wandered as he pondered how to speak up. After a while, he reached out and touched the clothes bought by Shen Xue, saying:
1:5:45|1:6:1|The two fell silent again, with [Yan Shouyi] looking flustered as he drove, while [Shen Xue] was brewing up emotions. Suddenly, she raised her voice and said, "Yan Shouyi's lies have been exposed, and he doesn't know how to respond."
1:6:1|1:6:8|Shen Xue looked aggrievedly ahead, Yan Shouyi had to tell the truth.
1:6:50|1:7:4|[Yan Shouyi] knew he was in the wrong, but still lost his temper. [Shen Xue] softened her tone, leaned on [Yan Shouyi]'s shoulder, and started acting coquettish.
1:7:15|1:7:24|[Yan Shouyi] kissed [Shen Xue]'s forehead, and the two reconciled. The scene shifted to [Niu Caiyun], the daughter of Lv Guihua, sitting in [Yan Shouyi]'s home.
1:8:25|1:8:37|[Yan Shouyi] turned to [Niu Caiyun] and said, [Yan Shouyi] remained silent, then turned back to continue watching TV.
1:8:37|1:9:6|The next day, [Yan Shouyi] was driving around looking for a parking spot. Not far ahead, [Fei Mo] got out of the passenger side of a car, with a young woman who shouted at him. [Fei Mo] turned around, and the woman opened an umbrella and kissed him on the face. [Fei Mo] smiled and was about to leave. [Yan Shouyi] in the car observed everything. [Fei Mo] left with the umbrella, and [Yan Shouyi] parked the car next to the woman.
1:9:6|1:9:32|The woman in the car had her phone number written below, she drove away. [Yan Shouyi] took out his phone and called [Fei Mo], who was holding a lady's umbrella and struggling to take out his phone. [Yan Shouyi] teased: [Fei Mo] turned his head and looked around.
1:11:12|1:11:28|[Yan Shouyi] took out a photo from his pocket and handed it to [Fei Mo]. [Fei Mo] took it and saw a photo of Yu Wenjuan holding a child. He sighed and handed the photo back with a smile. However, [Yan Shouyi] said:
1:11:39|1:11:48|[Fei Mo] nodded knowingly and put away the photo.
1:11:59|1:12:7|A reader handed a book to [Fei Mo] for an autograph, and [Fei Mo] quickly signed it with a pen before returning the book to the reader.
1:12:26|1:12:40|Another reader came to ask for an autograph from [Fei Mo]. [Yan Shouyi] opened his phone to check the message, it was a text from Wu Yue, she said: I want to see your physical performance, bite you. After reading it, [Yan Shouyi] was stunned.
1:12:40|1:12:47|Yan Shouyi immediately turned around to search for Wu Yue's figure. At this moment, Wu Yue was wearing a cheongsam with her hair pinned up on top of her head, holding a wine glass.
1:12:47|1:12:55|She pretended to casually glance at [Yan Shouyi] over her shoulder, then continued to elegantly drink her wine, covering her mouth while chatting and laughing with the guests.
1:12:55|1:13:13|After three rounds of drinks, Yan Shouyi was still awake in the restroom. She put a towel on her face in front of the mirror when suddenly her phone rang. She hurriedly dropped the towel, fumbled for her phone in her bag, and, unable to stand steadily due to the alcohol, had to lean on the sink. She picked up the phone to check the message.
1:13:13|1:13:21|It's a text message from [Yan Shouyi], he said: "Stop messing around, my enemy." Wu Yue held the phone, leaned on the sink and laughed.
1:13:22|1:13:32|She then picked up her phone and texted [Yan Shouyi], the message read: Room 518.
1:13:40|1:13:59|The drama school is recruiting students, with [Shen Xue] as one of the examiners. Niu Caiyun walked out from among more than ten candidates, handed the registration form to the chief examiner, glanced at [Shen Xue], then walked to the middle of the classroom. The candidates behind him were all giggling, and [Shen Xue] and Teacher Su were also amused.
1:14:12|1:14:25|Niu Caiyun immediately turned around and walked quickly towards the classroom door after listening. She opened the door and walked out, closing it heavily. After a while of silence, the examinees all looked towards the door. Teacher Su and [Shen Xue] exchanged a glance, and the chief examiner said:
1:15:8|1:15:36|The elevator doors closed, [Yan Shouyi] pressed the button for the fifth floor. He opened his phone to read Wu Yue's message, then deleted it. Leaning against the wall, he soon arrived at the fifth floor as the elevator stopped. Stepping out, he paused in the elevator lobby, glanced around, and found the room sign on the wall. With hands behind his back, he walked slowly forward, reaching the corridor entrance and peering inside to find it empty.
1:15:36|1:15:59|He carefully looked around, making sure no one was there, before sitting down on a chair at the entrance of the corridor. He took off the flower on his suit and put it in his pocket, glancing around anxiously. He fidgeted on the chair uneasily, suddenly remembering something.
1:15:59|1:16:14|Perhaps worried that someone might call, or perhaps feeling guilty, the phone was still on, so he took out the battery. After some manipulation, he finally stood up and walked in confidently.
1:16:14|1:16:30|[Shen Xue] walked in the hallway of the teaching building, looking around for Niu Caiyun. The hallway was filled with exam candidates nervously preparing for the exam. [Shen Xue] walked out of the teaching building, and the campus was also crowded with people. She quickly made her way through the crowd and finally found Niu Caiyun.
1:16:30|1:16:38|Niu Caiyun sat on a stone bench, chatting with several candidates. [Shen Xue] quickened her pace and walked over angrily, saying to Niu Caiyun:
1:17:17|1:17:26|Shen Xue turned and left, leaving Niu Caiyun looking puzzled. In a hotel room, shelves were filled with Fei Mo's books, and the voices of a man and a woman could be heard from a phone.
1:18:0|1:18:10|Wu Yue sat on the edge of the bed, pressed the pause button on her phone, and turned to look at [Yan Shouyi] lying on the bed.
1:18:42|1:19:22|[Yan Shouyi] stared at Wu Yue and turned his body, saying, "You haven't finished speaking." Suddenly, [Yan Shouyi] agilely sat up, and Wu Yue said word by word. [Yan Shouyi] looked at Wu Yue in shock, the two of them fell into silence. Wu Yue turned back with a look of unwillingness. [Yan Shouyi], feeling defeated, rubbed his eyes helplessly and slowly said:
1:19:37|1:20:3|[Yan Shouyi] widened his eyes and turned to look at Wu Yue. Tears were streaming down Wu Yue's face as she sobbed uncontrollably. [Yan Shouyi] was stunned, unable to speak a word. He withdrew his gaze and chose to avoid the situation, slowly lying back on the bed, staring at the ceiling in silence.
1:20:3|1:20:9|[Shen Xue] and [Yan Shouyi] are preparing to send [Niu Caiyun] back to her hometown. The platform at the train station is bustling with people.
1:20:26|1:20:31|Shen Xue's phone rang, and she answered the call, asking:
1:21:28|1:21:34|At this moment, [Shen Xue] is looking out of the train window searching for [Niu Caiyun], [Yan Shouyi] hands the phone to [Shen Xue] and says:
1:21:43|1:21:58|[Yan Shouyi] paced uneasily, waved goodbye to [Niu Caiyun] over his shoulder. After finishing the call, [Shen Xue] turned around, looked at [Yan Shouyi], sighed and said:
1:22:21|1:22:40|[Yan Shouyi] remained silent, lowered his head. [Shen Xue] and [Yan Shouyi] arrived at [Fei Mo]'s home. [Fei Mo] sat dejectedly on the sofa, the table piled with writing materials and calligraphy works. [Li Yan] picked up a cigarette at the desk, crying as she lit it. His face was haggard, unkempt as he smoked. His eyes were swollen, and he choked back sobs in a sorry state.
1:23:3|1:23:7|[Li Yan] stood up and walked towards [Fei Mo] with the room key.
1:23:41|1:24:3|[Fei Mo] sat hunched over on the sofa, hands clasped together, closing his eyes in despair. [Yan Shouyi] found a box of tissues and walked towards [Fei Mo]. Like a child who had done something wrong, [Fei Mo] sat motionless on the sofa. [Yan Shouyi] sat down next to [Fei Mo], handing him the tissues. [Fei Mo] stared blankly for a long time before coming to his senses, glancing at [Yan Shouyi].
1:24:4|1:24:10|Wiping his face with a tissue, [Yan Shouyi] stepped past him and picked up the room key on the sofa.
1:24:10|1:24:42|He opened the room card and saw the name [Fei Mo] on it. [Fei Mo] said with sadness: [Yan Shouyi] turned to look at [Fei Mo], who lowered his head, furrowed his brows, and showed a helpless expression. He slowly turned his head to glance at [Yan Shouyi], sighed, and suddenly there was a bang of the door closing. Both of them looked towards the inner room at the same time. [Yan Shouyi] turned around and [Fei Mo] said:
1:25:10|1:25:17|[Fei Mo] cried bitterly, furrowing his brows tightly, tears welling up in his eyes. He shook his head and said to himself:
1:25:29|1:25:46|[Yan Shouyi] stared at the room key without saying a word, quietly listening to [Fei Mo]'s confession. [Fei Mo] slowly said, "Yan Shouyi" turned his head in confusion to look at [Fei Mo], who also turned to explain to [Yan Shouyi]:
1:26:11|1:26:24|[Fei Mo] suddenly stopped, [Yan Shouyi] glanced at [Fei Mo]. [Fei Mo] moved slowly, weakly took out his phone from his pocket, handed it to [Yan Shouyi] without looking at him, and shook his hand absentmindedly.
1:26:32|1:26:45|[Fei Mo] said a few words and then turned his head to the side, sighing to himself. [Yan Shouyi] glanced at the inner room, then turned to look at [Fei Mo]. Seeing how upset [Fei Mo] looked, [Yan Shouyi] didn't know what to say.
1:26:47|1:26:56|Back at home, [Yan Shouyi] is searching for something under the table. [Shen Xue] takes the photo of Yu Wenjuan holding a child and slams it heavily on the table.
1:28:30|1:28:40|[Yan Shouyi] walked towards the door, immediately turned back upon hearing the words. He angrily took out his phone from his pocket.
1:28:44|1:28:58|[Yan Shouyi] angrily stormed out, and soon he came back with a bag in hand. He then slammed the door shut heavily. [Shen Xue] sat still in her place, while [Yan Shouyi] stood on the stage in the broadcasting studio recording the program.
1:29:40|1:29:44|The audience burst into laughter as [Yan Shouyi] turned to the side and took out the script to read.
1:29:44|1:29:52|The band on the side started playing music to ease the atmosphere, while [Yan Shouyi] looked at the script in frustration but with a distracted mind.
1:29:52|1:30:5|He seemed a bit distracted, and after watching for a while, he suddenly sighed and turned to the musicians, saying, "The band has stopped."
1:30:6|1:30:29|Turning around, [Yan Shouyi] calmed down and looked at the script seriously. The audience and crew patiently waited for him. He then folded the paper and put it in his pocket, raised his head, nodded to the cameraman, and said, "Facing the camera, [Yan Shouyi] took a deep breath and gave a big smile."
1:30:32|1:30:57|The scene shifts to the home of [Yan Shouyi]. Suddenly, the phone rings in the room. The camera scans past rows of photo albums on the bedroom table, while the phone continues to ring. The camera follows the sound and moves forward to the living room doorway, where the phone keeps ringing, but no one answers.
1:30:57|1:31:18|At this moment, [Shen Xue] was nowhere to be found. The room was empty, and the camera moved forward from the dining room to the living room. The phone was still ringing. The camera moved to the doorway of the room, where [Yan Shouyi] had placed his phone on the shoe cabinet. The screen of the phone was flashing along with the ringtone, as if something important was happening.
1:31:18|1:31:23|At this moment, [Shen Xue] and Li Yan are in the process of conducting business at the service hall.
1:31:34|1:31:41|They walked out of the lobby's main door, each holding a one to two-meter long call log.
1:32:12|1:32:31|Upon hearing Li Yan's words, [Shen Xue] took out her phone from her pocket, holding a call log sheet in one hand as she dialed the number. Li Yan anxiously watched as [Shen Xue] finished dialing the number and placed the phone on the dial button. After hesitating for a moment, she closed the phone and turned to Li Yan, saying:
1:32:36|1:33:3|Back home, [Shen Xue] heard the phone ringing as soon as she opened the door. She turned around and saw that it was [Yan Shouyi]'s phone on the shoe cabinet. The phone kept ringing. He picked it up and saw "Yu Wenjuan" displayed on the screen. After a moment of thought, he put the phone back on the shoe cabinet. The phone kept ringing, but [Shen Xue] remained unfazed. As she walked towards the sofa to put down her bag, [Yan Shouyi]'s phone rang twice again, this time it was a text message.
1:33:3|1:33:9|[Shen Xue] put down her bag and walked over, opened her phone to check the message. She stared at it and froze in place.
1:33:9|1:33:25|The sunlight outside the window cast her shadow on the wall. She slowly lifted her head and stood still, lost in thought for a long time. The message on her phone was hard for her to accept at the moment. Then she paced back and forth on the floor, looking at her phone and muttering to herself:
1:33:29|1:34:2|Shen Xue picked up her phone, pacing back and forth in contemplation. Yan Shouyi was on his way home when the traffic light turned red. His car stopped at the intersection, and he sat inside in silence, staring blankly with a heavy heart, as if he had lost his soul. When the green light came on, the vehicles at the intersection started moving one after another, passing by Yan Shouyi, who was completely absorbed in his own world, indifferent to his surroundings.
1:34:2|1:34:10|Causing a traffic jam without realizing it, he glanced ahead and only then realized he had lost focus, quickly driving forward.
1:34:13|1:34:21|[Shen Xue] sat at the table, the room pitch black. He lit match after match, but didn't light the candle on the table.
1:34:21|1:34:29|Letting the match burn in his hand, the flickering flame illuminated his face. The door suddenly swung open,
1:34:29|1:34:45|[Yan Shouyi] stood at the door, looking at [Shen Xue] without moving. However, [Shen Xue] showed no reaction, staring blankly at the matches in her hand. [Yan Shouyi] turned on the table lamp at the door, then closed the door. [Shen Xue] held a lit match in her hand, but suddenly let it go.
1:34:45|1:35:8|The match fell into the ashtray and went out. She lit another match. [Yan Shouyi] slowly walked over, stopping next to [Shen Xue]. [Shen Xue] stared at the flame in her hand without speaking. [Shen Xue] said weakly, "..." [Yan Shouyi] froze, looking down to see his phone on the table.
1:35:8|1:35:25|He reached out to grab the phone, opened it with a serious expression, and saw a text message from Wu Yue: "I want to see [Shen Xue], you figure it out." Also in sight was a photo of [Yan Shouyi] and Wu Yue, where Wu Yue was topless and kissing [Yan Shouyi].
1:35:26|1:35:43|[Yan Shouyi] folded his phone, calmed down for a moment, the light outside the window flickered and changed, illuminating the dark room. [Yan Shouyi] walked slowly to [Shen Xue]'s side and sat across from her. [Shen Xue] remained silent, playing with a match in her hand.
1:35:54|1:36:1|[Yan Shouyi] still received no response, he lowered his head and dared not look at [Shen Xue], nervously shifting his body.
1:36:11|1:36:43|[Yan Shouyi] confessed everything. [Shen Xue] lit another match, as [Yan Shouyi] continued: The match in [Shen Xue]'s hand gradually went out, [Yan Shouyi] said self-deprecatingly: [Yan Shouyi] finished speaking and buried his head even lower.
1:36:48|1:37:4|[Yan Shouyi] laid everything out, but [Shen Xue] still refused to speak. Just then, a call from Yu Wenjuan came in. [Yan Shouyi] glanced at it and immediately became nervous, quickly moving to the side to answer.
1:37:5|1:37:15|[Shen Xue] was still lighting the match, she finally picked up the match and was ready to light it. [Shen Xue] lit the match,
1:37:15|1:37:29|With a vacant look, like a puppet, [Yan Shouyi] stood by the window, his tone gradually becoming heavy. [Yan Shouyi] looked serious as he quickly walked over, picked up his phone, and said to [Shen Xue]:
1:37:42|1:38:9|[Yan Shouyi] walked to the door and left in big strides. [Shen Xue] lit a candle, a tear suddenly rolled down her cheek. She picked up a match again and approached the flame of the candle. With a crackling sound, the match was lit. [Yan Shouyi] rushed to his hometown with his son overnight. The car drove on a bumpy stone road surrounded by mountains. [Yan Shouyi] drove the car, silent and expressionless, as the car bumped forward.
1:38:9|1:38:39|In the back seat sits the nanny, holding the son of [Yan Shouyi] in her arms. The son is wearing his grandmother's jade ring on his chest. The vehicle passes through a large flock of sheep, kicking up a cloud of dust on the unpaved country road. In the distance, the sky is already turning a fish-belly white, with sunlight shining on the hills on both sides. [Yan Shouyi] parks the car in front of the old house's gate, and a tricycle bumps its way over, loaded with wreaths.
1:38:39|1:38:43|They untied the ropes on the car and took off the wreaths one by one.
1:38:43|1:38:52|Three to five people cooperated to carry the wreath into the courtyard. [Yan Shouyi] squatted at the door holding his grandmother's portrait, his head hanging silently.
1:38:53|1:39:0|Brick Brother sat on the side of the threshold, head down and despondent. People in the yard were busy setting up the scene for the funeral.
1:39:1|1:39:9|At the door hung a white plaque with the words "Mother of a Thousand Years". The brick spoke to [Yan Shouyi].
1:40:33|1:41:15|Brick Brother sighed and lowered his head. After Brick Brother choked out his words, the two of them knelt in front of their grandmother's grave in white mourning clothes, kowtowed, and then slowly stood up. [Yan Shouyi] took out some firewood from his pocket, lit a match, and walked slowly forward. The ground was covered with white wreaths piled up like small mountains. [Yan Shouyi] lit a match and walked slowly forward.
1:41:15|1:41:43|He placed a match at the edge of the wreath, which was instantly ignited. Brick followed suit, lighting a match and placing it on the wreath as well. The mound-like wreath was gradually engulfed by flames. Brick then turned and walked away, joining the younger generation nearby. Everyone had a sorrowful expression, mourning the passing of their grandmother together. [Yan Shouyi] remained in place, watching the wreath burn bit by bit. His gaze was vacant, as if pondering something.
1:41:43|1:41:54|The fire grew larger and the wreaths crackled as they burned. Suddenly, [Yan Shouyi] lowered his head and took out his phone, throwing it into the fire.
1:42:46|1:43:3|The wreath gradually burned out, and the screen slowly darkened. With the sound of high heels, the scene shifted to the home of [Yan Shouyi], where a woman in a long dress and high heels walked to the sofa and sat down. [Yan Shouyi] sat on the sofa a few meters away, with a book on his knee.
