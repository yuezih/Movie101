0:2:35|0:2:44|The film begins with an old man walking unsteadily in front, followed by a man and a woman. The three of them arrive at the Memorial Hall of the Victims in Nanjing Massacre together.
0:2:44|0:2:50|The walls of the memorial hall are covered with old photos from the wartime, and glass display cases showcase some scattered old items.
0:2:52|0:3:5|The old man walked steadily, looking around, and suddenly was attracted by a statue. He stopped and walked over, only to see a naked woman on the statue, kneeling on the ground with tears in her eyes.
0:3:5|0:3:12|The old man stared fixedly at the statue, his mind going back in time to the cruel and unbearable events of his youth.
0:3:12|0:3:20|As a young man, he was brought to the Japanese military camp, where a Japanese officer pointed at his nose and berated him, accusing him of being unworthy to serve as an officer.
0:3:22|0:3:26|He shouted not to, but was still rudely dragged away by the soldiers.
0:3:26|0:3:31|That night, a truck delivered all the captured girls to the soldiers' quarters separately.
0:3:31|0:3:43|In a small wooden house, there was only her and a Japanese soldier. The soldier came up and slapped her twice, then took off his clothes and pressed them on her, constantly beating and ravaging her, subjecting her to endless humiliation.
0:3:43|0:3:50|Recalling the tragic past, [Liu Hemei] clutched her head in agony, unable to speak as she stumbled dangerously.
0:3:51|0:3:54|The two companions heard a strange noise and hurried over.
0:3:54|0:4:7|Liu Hemei fell into an illusion, the people in front of her suddenly turned into Japanese officers and soldiers, repeatedly shouting a Japanese name. Then, Liu Hemei saw many men and women from different eras in front of her.
0:4:8|0:4:11|Everyone stared at him intently and approached step by step.
0:4:11|0:4:18|In the hallucination, [Liu Hemei] hurriedly fled to a dim corridor and accidentally fell to the ground.
0:4:18|0:4:22|Upon standing up, Liu Hemei found everything around her spinning wildly.
0:4:22|0:4:28|The scene cuts back to the real world, where [Liu Hemei] is rushed to the hospital for treatment, and the [doctor] performs a check-up on him.
0:4:28|0:4:32|In the hospital room, [Liu Hemei] woke up struggling with a complex device on her head.
0:5:23|0:5:30|[Liu Hemei] gradually settled down, lying on the hospital bed with his eyes closed, while the female doctor gently stroked his graying hair.
0:5:30|0:5:34|Liu Hemei murmured and fell into a deep sleep under the comfort of the female doctor.
0:5:34|0:5:38|As it turns out, the old man's name is [Kazumi Akiyama].
0:5:38|0:5:45|The female doctor looked at the old man, then turned to the computer screen after confirming he was asleep. The screen displayed the structure of the old man's brain.
0:5:46|0:5:57|The female doctor seemed to have noticed something unusual, as if a wave of electricity was flowing, extracting memories from the old man, transporting them back to the era of the fierce fighting between the Qinghua and Japanese armies.
0:5:57|0:6:17|Young [Liu Hemei] in a smart suit walks through a courtyard adorned with various flags, strides into a magnificent building, and is greeted by a gorgeously dressed Western woman. They shake hands warmly, and she then leads [Liu Hemei] to a well-dressed white man, who hands [Liu Hemei] a glass of wine.
0:6:17|0:6:19|Start a friendly conversation with her.
0:6:19|0:6:29|The Caucasian man heard that [Liu Hemei] was a special invited journalist from three Western news agencies, so he asked [Liu Hemei] how she viewed the performance of the Japanese army in the Sino-Japanese War.
0:6:37|0:6:41|Western armies from various countries are plundering the treasures in the Forbidden City.
0:6:41|0:6:46|These bronzes and porcelains stolen from the Forbidden City are still displayed in museums around the world.
0:6:46|0:6:53|Even in their own country of France, the Japanese army at the time was guarding the gates of the Forbidden City.
0:6:53|0:6:59|While not everyone is virtuous, the overall image of discipline in the Japanese army remains one of restraint.
0:7:17|0:7:23|At this moment, another Western man hurriedly ran down from upstairs, informing everyone that an important broadcast needed to be listened to.
0:7:39|0:7:47|In the scene, innocent Chinese civilians are being buried alive by the Japanese invaders, with bodies littering the streets. [Kazumi Akiyama] listens to the broadcast with a solemn expression.
0:7:47|0:7:58|Shortly after, [Kazumi Akiyama] sat in the car, anxiously preparing to go home. Unexpectedly, in a small alley, several uninvited guests suddenly rushed to the front of the car and shot at [Kazumi Akiyama]. The driver knocked one of them down to the ground.
0:8:0|0:8:5|At this moment, a man in a suit rushed over, drew his gun, and engaged in a gunfight with those criminals.
0:8:5|0:8:9|Japanese soldiers nearby heard the gunshots and quickly rushed over.
0:8:9|0:8:15|The man in a suit took out his gun, only to find that he had run out of bullets, so he had to run towards the Japanese soldier who came to support.
0:8:23|0:8:28|Later, Liu Hemei returned to the Japanese military headquarters and reported the street gunfight to his superior.
0:8:42|0:8:47|Originally, [Kazumi Akiyama] was a well-known journalist in the West, her power alone equivalent to an army.
0:8:47|0:8:51|Japan needs [Kazumi Akiyama] to give them positive coverage internationally.
0:8:51|0:8:53|To maintain the image of Japan.
0:8:57|0:9:5|The man in a suit then drove to the home of [Liu Hemei], who lived in a two-story European-style villa, with several Japanese soldiers standing guard at the door.
0:9:5|0:9:13|[Liu Hemei] learned that the man in the suit was named Nakamura, and couldn't help but smile with joy. The two sat chatting at a table on the terrace.
0:9:21|0:9:29|Liu Hemei lowered her head and smiled shyly upon hearing it, showing a hint of modesty as she humbly thanked Nakamura for the compliment.
0:9:45|0:9:49|Hemei was pleasantly surprised to find that Nakamura shared the same opinion as her.
0:10:15|0:10:23|The scene shifts to a truck full of girls entering the camp, which is the comfort station established by the Japanese army.
0:10:23|0:10:30|A charming woman in a kimono is handing out invoices to the soldiers, with [Liu Hemei] also hiding among the Japanese soldiers in the queue.
0:10:31|0:10:34|The female administrator did not realize that [Liu Hemei] is a woman.
0:10:38|0:10:44|[Liu Hemei] pushed open the door and walked into the room, only to see a North Korean woman wrapped in a blanket lying on the bed.
0:10:44|0:10:48|The North Korean woman turned her back on [Liu Hemei] without even looking back.
0:10:55|0:11:1|The North Korean woman turned back to take a look, and was surprised to find that [Liu Hemei] was actually a woman.
0:11:2|0:11:7|Instinctively clutching her chest, Liu Hemei shrank at the head of the bed, tears on her face, her lips trembling.
0:11:34|0:11:46|Liu Hemei was deeply shocked. Although she was Japanese, as a woman, she could not tolerate any woman from any nation being subjected to such bullying and oppression.
0:11:54|0:12:2|At this moment, a woman in a cheongsam with her hair pinned up was about to enter the room. After hearing the conversation between the father and daughter, she quietly retreated.
0:12:2|0:12:6|Hemei's father, although on good terms with the commander, advised Hemei not to submit this report.
0:12:36|0:12:47|The scene shifts, at night, in a luxurious room, a Japanese general is playfully frolicking with [Kazumi Akiyama], the female administrator, who is lying coquettishly in the general's arms.
0:13:0|0:13:4|General Liu Hemei, upon hearing this, flew into a rage and slapped her to the ground.
0:13:10|0:13:13|The female administrator picked up her clothes in panic and left.
0:13:13|0:13:17|After daybreak, the scene shifts to a gray-red church.
0:13:17|0:13:22|The cheongsam-clad woman who eavesdropped on the conversation at Liu Hemei's house was also sitting in the seat at the church.
0:13:22|0:13:28|At this moment, three male agents disguised themselves and casually sat near the cheongsam-wearing woman in the prayer hall.
0:13:28|0:13:32|The woman in cheongsam secretly slipped a letter into the sleeve of the man next to her.
0:13:32|0:13:37|Three agents immediately pulled out their guns and stopped the man as soon as he stood up.
0:13:37|0:13:44|At this moment, several men's accomplices emerged from behind the church and started shooting at the three agents, while [Kazumi Akiyama] drove home as usual.
0:13:44|0:13:49|The driver parked the car at the entrance and kindly got out to open the door for [Kazumi Akiyama].
0:13:49|0:14:4|[Kazumi Akiyama] walked into the room with her hands in her pockets, only to be taken aback by the sight inside. The living room was lit up, but it was in a mess as if it had experienced a fierce fight. Books were scattered all over the floor, and to her horror, her parents were lying in a pool of blood.
0:14:4|0:14:9|[Kazumi Akiyama] stood at the doorway, leaning against the door frame, her legs seeming a bit uncooperative.
0:14:9|0:14:14|She moved slowly into the room, leaning on the cabinet, and knelt down in front of her parents.
0:14:14|0:14:20|She shook her parents' arms, crying out for them, but they did not respond at all.
0:14:33|0:14:37|[Kazumi Akiyama] stood up and found her father holding a letter in his hand.
0:14:37|0:14:41|She trembled as she opened the letter, only to find it was her father's final words to her.
0:14:57|0:15:6|Before his death, the father entrusted Liu Hemei to the mother, with a final warning to Liu Hemei that she is in danger and must leave quickly.
0:15:6|0:15:13|[Liu Hemei] couldn't accept the sudden loss of her parents and the change in her identity. She tightly held the letter against her chest, crying bitterly.
0:15:14|0:15:17|That night, a Japanese military unit arrived at the home of [Liu Hemei].
0:15:17|0:15:22|[Liu Hemei], who was sleeping on the sofa, was awakened and, upon checking the door, found that the visitor was Nakamura.
0:15:22|0:15:24|Nakamura brought [Liu Hemei] into the room.
0:15:24|0:15:29|Liu Hemei could no longer contain her sorrowful emotions and started crying in Nakamura's arms.
0:15:29|0:15:34|At this moment, Nakamura heard the sound of a car outside the room and realized that Japanese soldiers were catching up.
0:15:39|0:15:48|Nakamura led [Kazumi Akiyama] to the outside of the house. After confirming that they were not discovered, the two carefully bent down along the railing and quickly crossed the open balcony.
0:15:48|0:15:56|The next moment, the Japanese soldiers downstairs followed closely in a car, crouching low as they moved along the edge of the woods.
0:15:56|0:16:3|Nakamura decisively led Kazumi Akiyama over the barrier. The Japanese soldiers noticed that Kazumi Akiyama had escaped and immediately turned around to chase after her.
0:16:3|0:16:7|At this moment, [Kazumi Akiyama] fled to a small road, where several Chinese people came to pick her up.
0:16:13|0:16:16|The Japanese army's vehicle drove through the jungle, relentlessly pursuing.
0:16:16|0:16:20|[Nakamura] led [Kazumi Akiyama] to the office of the Chinese underground party.
0:16:20|0:16:25|The intelligence officer came to report to the chief, who warmly welcomed the two of them.
0:17:19|0:17:25|The sound of gunfire and explosions from the Japanese invaders completely shattered.
0:17:25|0:17:27|After the occupation of Nanjing and Shanghai,
0:17:31|0:17:35|Countless common people,
0:17:44|0:17:51|The camera moves to the city of Yangon in Myanmar, where temples are abundant and countless pagodas stand tall in the wilderness.
0:17:51|0:18:0|The locals were still leading a peaceful life, with rickshaw pullers shuttling on the streets and small vendors calling out to passersby to promote their goods.
0:18:0|0:18:6|[Kazumi Akiyama] and [Huang Ziqian] arrived at a temple in the back of a car, walking side by side on a path next to the temple.
0:18:6|0:18:11|The sound of wind chimes and chanting, everywhere is peace and tranquility.
0:18:18|0:18:35|[Huang Ziqian] took a few steps forward, bent down to pick up a clock pendulum. He looked back at [Liu Hemei], the two exchanged smiles, then he turned the pendulum and raised his hand to strike down.
0:18:37|0:18:45|[Liu Hemei] looked up, at this moment, the sunlight shining on her cheeks, the breeze blowing through her hair, a long-lost smile appearing on her face.
0:18:45|0:18:50|On May 10th, the two returned to the inn, and [Huang Ziqian] handed a clean towel to [Liu Hemei].
0:18:50|0:18:55|[Liu Hemei] stood next to [Ziqian], wearing a silk nightgown, and gently wiped her face with a towel.
0:18:55|0:18:59|[Ziqian] saw that [Liu Hemei] looked a bit awkward in her outfit, with her eyes avoiding contact.
0:19:5|0:19:20|[Ziqian] finished speaking and then left the room. She closed the door, stood at the doorway taking a deep breath to calm her restless heart, and then, after calming down, rolled up her sleeves, turned around, and went to wash up.
0:19:21|0:19:25|[Liu Hemei] in the room also lifted the blanket and prepared to lie down to sleep.
0:19:25|0:19:31|Before long, [Huang Ziqian] returned from washing up and was about to knock on the door, but he hesitated, afraid of disturbing [Liu Hemei] who was sleeping, so he quietly pushed the door open.
0:19:33|0:19:37|He saw [Liu Hemei] sleeping alone on one side of the bed, motionless.
0:19:37|0:19:51|Ziqian regained her senses and pondered for a few seconds. Looking around, she saw the simple furnishings in the room, with only a wardrobe and a dressing table. She could only sleep on the recliner, so she covered herself with her suit jacket and prepared to sleep.
0:19:51|0:19:58|At this moment, [Liu Hemei] slowly opened her eyes and realized that Ziqian had not gone to bed to tell her.
0:20:2|0:20:4|Ziqian then fell asleep on the other side of the bed.
0:20:4|0:20:13|In her dream, [Kazumi Akiyama] dreamed again of the day her father warned her not to insist on writing the report about Wei Anfu.
0:20:13|0:20:17|Perhaps it wouldn't have ended up in such devastation and displacement as it is today.
0:20:17|0:20:23|Kazumi Akiyama saw her father tragically die in front of her in her dream, tears streaming down her face.
0:20:23|0:20:28|Ziqian heard Kazumi's crying, immediately turned around, hesitated for a few seconds, and then turned around to hug Kazumi.
0:20:33|0:20:36|Four years later, [Liu Hemei] brought her daughter to the church to pray.
0:21:8|0:21:13|Liu Hemei and her daughter were stopped by a mysterious old man wearing a hat as soon as they walked out the door.
0:21:19|0:21:22|The old man handed a jade pendant to Liu Hemei.
0:21:29|0:21:36|Hemei picked up the clothing pendant, using her fingers to stroke it in circles, a look of confusion on her face.
0:21:36|0:21:43|She walked out of the temple hand in hand with her daughter, the bustling street filled with pedestrians and the clear sound of car horns echoing in the street.
0:21:43|0:21:50|The daughter took small steps and opened her arms to chase after her mother, and the mother and daughter played and frolicked all the way.
0:21:50|0:21:52|Back home, Liu Hemei's daughter started singing nursery rhymes in the courtyard.
0:22:29|0:22:36|In the sound of gunfire, [Huang Ziqian] watches people fleeing in the chaotic streets and hurries home to look for his daughter and [Liu Hemei].
0:22:51|0:22:59|War is approaching, and in order to escape the conflict, the civilians in Myanmar are carrying their belongings and leading their livestock, desperately running along the mountain path.
0:22:59|0:23:1|In a hurry, [Kazumi Akiyama] almost stumbled while rushing to catch a mistress.
0:23:6|0:23:28|A group of people had just escaped to a suspension bridge when Japanese planes were gradually approaching, with the sky tainted by smoke. Countless bombs fell like raindrops into the lake, causing huge waves. Explosions and cries for help intertwined as gunfire approached. In the midst of the crisis, Liu Hemei became separated from her daughter.
0:23:28|0:23:35|A shell landed on the suspension bridge, blowing the bridge deck to pieces. Back to the present, [Liu Hemei] woke up in the hospital bed.
0:23:44|0:23:49|Kazumi Akiyama anxiously reaches out with both hands, as if trying to grasp something.
0:23:49|0:23:53|The female doctor ran out of the ward, closed her eyes and leaned against the wall, shaking her head.
0:23:53|0:23:56|Her boyfriend noticed that she looked a bit off and was very worried about her condition.
0:23:59|0:24:3|The female doctor covered her head, and her boyfriend quickly stepped forward to support her.
0:24:3|0:24:11|The female doctor named [Zhang Min] was seen leaning against the wall, stumbling forward as if she had lost her soul.
0:24:11|0:24:15|At this moment, [Liu Hemei] felt her legs go weak and wobbly, struggling to stand steady.
0:24:15|0:24:18|[Zhang Min] is feeling confused and disoriented.
0:24:23|0:24:29|[Zhang Min] returned home to find the walls covered with information about Wei Anfu.
0:24:29|0:24:36|He stood by the wall, staring fixedly at the photo of [Liu Hemei], pondering something in his mind.
0:24:36|0:24:42|Seeing [Zhang Min] still staring blankly at the photo, her boyfriend brought two glasses of water from the kitchen and handed them over.
0:24:42|0:24:46|Approaching [Zhang Min], Liu Hemei asked with concern.
0:25:21|0:25:24|So we invited him to come for an interview.
0:26:22|0:26:30|He is a comfort woman, the scene shifts to the hospital room, [Zhang Min] holds [Kazumi Akiyama]'s hand.
0:26:42|0:26:45|[Kazumi Akiyama] pointed to her own head.
0:27:13|0:27:17|Zhang Min took off the stethoscope, looked at Kazumi Akiyama with a worried expression, and asked.
0:27:38|0:27:42|He patted Liu Hemei's shoulder tenderly, and Hemei closed her eyes.
0:27:48|0:28:6|Zhang Min bent down, and Liu Hemei saw that her necklace seemed somewhat familiar. She realized it was the jade pendant that the mysterious old man had taught her in front of the church years ago.
0:28:45|0:28:51|[Zhang Min] held the jade pendant in front of her chest, glanced back at [Liu Hemei], and walked out of the ward thoughtfully.
0:28:51|0:28:55|Kazumi Akiyama lay on the bed, unable to believe such a coincidence could exist in the world.
0:29:22|0:29:31|The camera cuts to [Huang Xiaoli], now a middle-aged woman in a professional suit, carrying a handbag, entering a spacious Chinese-style office overseas.
0:29:32|0:29:36|She answered the phone call from her daughter [Zhang Min] in China.
0:30:59|0:31:8|In a Red Cross facility overseas, the skilled and experienced [Huang Ziqian] hung his head in disappointment as he listened to the staff telling him the news.
0:31:8|0:31:12|The Red Cross has been helping to search for his wife, [Liu Hemei].
0:31:12|0:31:19|However, after all these years, the relevant documents have long been buried, yet there is still no news of the whereabouts of [Liu Hemei].
0:31:19|0:31:24|The Red Cross also cannot confirm whether his wife is still in this world, they have done their best.
0:31:25|0:31:33|Ziqian listened in silence, knowing that she might never see Liu Hemei again in her lifetime, but still holding onto a glimmer of hope in her heart.
0:31:33|0:31:38|At this moment, [Huang Xiaoli] hurried over and excitedly told her father.
0:31:38|0:31:46|Ziqian was extremely excited. She raised her right hand in front of her chest, making a cross gesture, and devoutly prayed to God.
0:31:50|0:32:1|[Huang Ziqian] told the staff that they had hope of finding his wife, so he and his daughter happily left the Red Cross.
0:32:1|0:32:6|In order to see his mother and wife as soon as possible, the two of them took a plane overnight and rushed to Nanjing.
0:32:6|0:32:14|Just as her front foot touched the ground, Liu Hemei couldn't wait to get into the car with her daughter [Zhang Min] and boyfriend to rush to the hospital.
0:32:14|0:32:19|Ziqian was about to enter the hospital when Zhang Min came over to tell him that several people were outside the hospital building looking for Kazumi Akiyama.
0:32:33|0:32:38|Ming Min pointed forward with her finger, only to see [Liu Hemei] sitting by the small bridge in the hospital with a nurse.
0:32:38|0:32:44|They couldn't believe it, the missing Kazumi Akiyama for years, was right in front of their eyes at this moment.
0:32:44|0:32:51|Several people walked up to Kazumi Akiyama. She was being stingy, unaware of anyone approaching, and still had her eyes closed while sunbathing.
0:32:51|0:32:54|Ming Min walked up to Kazumi Akiyama and called her softly.
0:32:56|0:33:2|Kazumi Akiyama showed no reaction, only vaguely hearing her humming something under her breath.
0:33:2|0:33:15|[Huang Xiaoli] couldn't believe her eyes when she saw Hemei's awkward appearance. It was only then that Yoshito realized the nursery rhyme Hemei was humming was the same one her daughter Lily used to sing in Myanmar, "The Scholar".
0:33:15|0:33:23|[Huang Xiaoli] looked at his long-lost wife in front of him, his eyes already red, recalling the appearance of Kazumi Akiyama when they were young.
0:33:23|0:33:29|That year, Kazumi Akiyama, who planted the beans of youth, was still a girl with a good reputation and a smiling face like a flower.
0:33:29|0:33:37|And now, the woman in front of us has become an elderly person who has weathered many storms, with deep wrinkles on her cheeks, and her once bright eyes have also become cloudy.
0:33:53|0:34:1|A tear fell from [Kazumi Akiyama]'s cheek, and the wrinkles seemed to record all the hardships she had endured over the years.
0:34:1|0:34:9|Tears streaming down her face, [Huang Ziqian] sat next to Kazumi Akiyama, one hand resting on her knee as they sang a lullaby together.
0:34:9|0:34:18|Ziqian raised her hand and gently stroked the diseased hair of [Kazumi Akiyama], patiently counting each disobedient strand behind her ear.
0:34:35|0:34:46|Upon hearing his wife calling his name, [Huang Ziqian] trembled and asked, while [Huang Xiaoli] and Zhang Mingming excitedly ran forward to support [Kazumi Akiyama] on both sides.
0:35:19|0:35:29|Finally reunited, the family embraced tightly. At this moment, [Huang Ziqian] slowly stood up, gently patting the mother and daughter who were embracing each other, his voice trembling as he spoke.
0:35:56|0:36:10|An Mei and Ziqian watched the mother and daughter still embracing each other, unable to bear to separate them, so they turned away reluctantly and walked towards the distance.
0:36:10|0:36:15|Hemei looked up and watched Ziqian's figure walking away, memories flashing before her eyes.
0:36:15|0:36:22|She recalled the bits and pieces of the past, remembering the scene when Ziqian first rescued her on the street that year.
0:36:22|0:36:26|Thinking of Ziqian coming home, the two of them discussed the article on the balcony.
0:36:26|0:36:30|At that moment, their hearts and souls connected.
0:36:30|0:36:42|Thinking back to their years in Myanmar, the passionate love they shared, embracing, holding hands, strolling the streets in a foreign land, the fruit of their love, and all the beautiful moments they had together.
0:36:42|0:36:47|[Kazumi Akiyama] stared intently at the departing Ziqian, afraid that she would once again slip away from her sight.
0:36:48|0:36:58|Eyes filled with longing and nostalgia for [Huang Ziqian] over the years, their own wishes finally came true after enduring the test of time.
0:36:58|0:37:3|Fortunately, the two were able to reunite in their twilight years and accompany each other in their old age.
0:37:3|0:37:10|[Huang Ziqian] stood at the edge of the bridge, hands resting on the railing, while [Liu Hemei] bent at the waist, hands hanging low, slowly walked towards [Huang Ziqian].
0:37:10|0:37:15|Due to years of physical abuse and old age, [Liu Hemei] walked very slowly.
0:37:16|0:37:19|He walked unsteadily, but still resolutely.
0:37:19|0:37:23|[Zhang Min] wanted to step forward to help her grandmother, but was stopped by her mother.
0:37:23|0:37:27|[Huang Ziqian] looked up at his wife walking towards him with difficulty, feeling a pang in his nose.
0:37:27|0:37:38|At this moment, the distance between Kazumi Akiyama and [Huang Ziqian] was only a short ten meters, but it took them several decades to walk this short distance. Time had returned to the day they got lost during the war.
0:37:44|0:38:1|The falling shell destroyed the suspension bridge, [Huang Xiaoli] unfortunately got separated from her parents. She went through life and death alone, crying with no one to respond. Her small body was covered in blood, her clothes tattered. She walked alone on the rugged path, her cries echoing in the horrifying ruins.
0:38:2|0:38:15|The surrounding scene of devastation was filled with endless wailing, as the Japanese soldiers pressed the captured civilians, with [Huang Xiaoli] among them, following the crowd in a panic, walking aimlessly.
0:38:15|0:38:19|As the soldier passed by her, [Huang Xiaoli] appeared even more frail and tiny in the reflection.
0:38:26|0:38:37|Lily walked under a broken roof and was suddenly picked up by someone, who turned out to be her father, [Huang Ziqian].
0:38:37|0:38:45|[Huang Ziqian] smiled and embraced the crying Lily in his arms, the father and daughter finally reunited.
0:38:45|0:38:55|Myanmar has temporarily returned to calm, and the streets are bustling again. He held Lily and followed a monk, who led them to a shelter and introduced them to the female hostess here.
0:39:29|0:39:34|Lily saw a scarf in [Huang Ziqian]'s pocket.
0:39:34|0:39:42|[Huang Ziqian] took out a handkerchief from his pocket and looked at it before handing it to Lily.
0:39:42|0:39:48|The scene shifts to a waterfall in a mountainous forest, with water cascading down the steep cliff.
0:39:48|0:39:52|[Huang Ziqian] stumbled as he walked across a single-plank bridge over a stream with a horizontal bar.
0:39:52|0:39:57|She looked up and gazed around, only to see tall trees and scattered rocks.
0:39:58|0:40:5|Ziqian traverses the jungle alone, trekking through mountains and rivers, and even nearly falling into the swift river.
0:40:5|0:40:10|She searched everywhere for Liu Hemei's figure, and finally stood weakly by the stream, shouting loudly.
0:40:33|0:40:42|The Burmese sisters found the fox [Kazumi Akiyama] and brought it back to their home.
0:40:42|0:40:45|[Kazumi Akiyama] lay weakly on the bed with herbs applied to her back.
0:40:48|0:40:51|[Kazumi Akiyama] slowly opened her eyes.
0:40:51|0:40:58|On the other side, [Huang Xiaoli] ran into a temple, where she looked up at the Buddha and covered her eyes.
0:40:58|0:41:9|Liu Hemei then arrived at the edge of the alley, tiptoed and reached out to grab the offering bottle on the table. However, due to being too short, she accidentally knocked over the offering bottle onto the ground.
0:41:9|0:41:15|The abbot heard a voice and walked out from behind the Buddha statue. When he saw Xiaoli, he asked her:
0:41:24|0:41:34|Lili carried a bowl of medicine, her small body struggling to climb the steep wooden steps of the shelter, and handed the medicine to the ailing Ziqian lying on the ground.
0:41:34|0:41:39|Ziqian opened her eyes and looked at Xiaoli kneeling in front of her, holding up the medicine.
0:41:39|0:41:44|She forced a tired smile on her face and embraced [Lili] tightly.
0:41:44|0:41:46|[Liu Hemei] touched Ziqian's forehead with her small hand.
0:41:55|0:41:59|Lily pushes Ziqian's hand towards her mouth, indicating for her to take the medicine.
0:41:59|0:42:1|Ziqian smiled at Xiaoli.
0:42:1|0:42:7|At night, in the village where [Kazumi Akiyama] lives, the local people are dancing around a bonfire.
0:42:7|0:42:12|Liu Hemei, who has just recovered from a serious illness, stands outside the room, watching the people downstairs singing and dancing.
0:42:12|0:42:20|Unexpectedly, at this moment, a group of Japanese soldiers were ambushing behind the trees in the jungle next to the bonfire, holding guns and aiming at the dancing civilians ahead.
0:42:21|0:42:26|Upstairs, [Liu Hemei] was startled and shivered, quickly grabbing her sister and running away.
0:42:26|0:42:33|Moments ago, the people who were dancing are now lying in a pool of blood. The Japanese army has surrounded the village, capturing Kazumi Akiyama and her sister.
0:42:33|0:42:38|A soldier looked at Liu Hemei with a sense of familiarity, squinting his eyes to carefully examine her.
0:42:39|0:42:42|He recognized that Liu Hemei was the female journalist who reported on Wei Anfu back then.
0:42:42|0:42:50|The soldier brought [Liu Hemei] back to the military camp, where a Japanese officer was practicing with a samurai sword in the room, swinging it forcefully against the wall repeatedly.
0:42:55|0:42:58|The soldier pulled [Liu Hemei] over and said happily.
0:43:0|0:43:6|The officer turned around and saw [Liu Hemei], walking up to her and scrutinizing her, questioning if she was the journalist Kazumi Akiyama from years ago.
0:43:12|0:43:15|The officer viciously grabbed [Liu Hemei]'s chin with his hand.
0:43:21|0:43:25|Hemei fearlessly and confidently tells the Japanese officer.
0:43:29|0:43:34|The officer slapped [Liu Hemei] to the ground, and [Liu Hemei] struggled to stand up.
0:43:48|0:43:49|Liu Hemei retorted.
0:43:58|0:44:0|Liu Hemei choked up and said.
0:44:11|0:44:17|Since Liu Hemei is so interested in Wei Anfu, let her have a chance and let Liu Hemei go.
0:44:29|0:44:34|And this scene is exactly the one that [Liu Hemei] recalled when she saw the statue in the memorial hall.
0:44:34|0:44:37|She struggled, but was still dragged away by the soldier.
0:44:37|0:44:44|Several trucks filled with girls from various countries are moving forward in the middle of the night, and the Japanese army has sent them all to comfort stations.
0:44:46|0:44:53|A group of soldiers surrounded the truck, dragging the girls off the vehicle and roughly herding them into the yard.
0:44:53|0:44:59|The first thing they did when they arrived here was to be urged to walk up to two small wooden tables and register.
0:44:59|0:45:3|During the day, several trucks drove in again, with [Kazumi Akiyama] and her sister among them.
0:45:4|0:45:8|Soldiers surrounding the entire courtyard of the comfort station, holding their guns.
0:45:8|0:45:13|The female administrator stared at them intently, afraid that they might escape if she wasn't careful.
0:45:13|0:45:20|Liu Hemei was forced to change into a kimono and, under the watch of two guards, walked into the line where names were being registered.
0:45:20|0:45:24|They were lined up in four rows, listening to the instructions of the Japanese officer on stage.
0:45:24|0:45:27|The Japanese officer paced back and forth on the stage with his hands behind his back.
0:45:28|0:45:34|Soldiers surrounded the comfort women group below, and the girls lowered their heads one by one, afraid to look at the officers in front of them.
0:45:34|0:45:37|The officer told the captured girls below the stage.
0:45:50|0:45:54|The girls in the audience were frightened by the gunshots, each of them trembling in fear.
0:45:58|0:46:8|The two administrators of the comfort station walked in front of the comfort women, all wearing wooden clogs, and under the guard of the soldiers, they led the comfort women to their respective rooms.
0:46:8|0:46:16|In a small wooden cabin, [Kazumi Akiyama] sits on the bed in fear, while a soldier leers at her menacingly.
0:46:20|0:46:29|The soldier angrily slapped Liu Hemei, knocking her down on the bed, then proceeded to strip and brutally beat and humiliate Kazumi Akiyama.
0:46:29|0:46:45|Another group of soldiers lined up and entered the comfort station under the leadership of an officer. They stopped in the middle of the courtyard, and the leading officer instructed the soldiers that each person would have 15 minutes to spend with a comfort woman. It was emphasized that safety measures must be taken to ensure physical health.
0:46:46|0:46:54|Two administrators were distributing tickets to the soldiers, warmly welcoming them, while [Kazumi Akiyama] looked on in despair.
0:46:54|0:47:3|All comfort women stood at the door of each wooden house waiting for the soldiers to enter, while the soldier holding the big ticket excitedly chose one comfort woman and dragged her into the room.
0:47:5|0:47:23|In a wooden cabin, a young girl with short hair sits on a bed, looking terrified at a soldier in stubble undressing in front of her. Tears of helplessness stream down the girl's face as she tries to escape, only to be slapped down by the soldier, who then pins her down on the bed.
0:47:24|0:47:28|The girl bit the soldier's arm and took the opportunity to escape from the room.
0:47:28|0:47:30|The female administrator quickly stopped her.
0:47:30|0:47:34|The little girl broke free from the female administrator and continued to run forward.
0:47:34|0:47:36|Encountering a patrolling officer unexpectedly.
0:47:36|0:47:40|The officer shot and killed the little girl without hesitation.
0:47:40|0:47:42|It's been countless nights already.
0:47:43|0:47:56|In this scene, trucks are coming in one after another to the comfort station. Soldiers on the watchtower watch as the trucks come and go. During the day, waves of soldiers drag comfort women into small wooden houses one after another.
0:47:56|0:48:2|Treating these women as mere tools for satisfying their animalistic desires, they took turns assaulting them without giving them any chance to catch their breath.
0:48:3|0:48:8|Comfort women endure inhuman torture day after day.
0:48:8|0:48:15|These days of living hell on earth are the norm in the comfort stations, and a nightmare for countless young girls.
0:48:15|0:48:18|The male manager of the comfort station quietly entered a small wooden house.
0:48:18|0:48:23|Comfort women covered their naked bodies with blankets, shrinking back in fear.
0:48:23|0:48:27|The male administrator took off his clothes and leered, demanding the comfort women to satisfy him.
0:48:28|0:48:34|The war rages on, with planes circling overhead, gunfire echoing, and the land scarred and devastated.
0:48:34|0:48:39|After the frontline soldiers finish their battle, they will line up to seek comfort at the comfort station.
0:48:39|0:48:46|One morning, Japanese soldiers escorted a group of naive and innocent young girls to the comfort station.
0:48:46|0:48:58|Comfort women behind the barbed wire watched these little girls, and the Burmese sister who was arrested with [Liu Hemei] recognized her own sister among the group of little girls, her sister's name is Nana.
0:49:0|0:49:7|[Kazumi Akiyama] and her sister desperately clung to the wire mesh fence, running alongside the little girl's group, shouting at the soldiers to let go of her sister.
0:49:8|0:49:14|These girls were pulled onto the truck by soldiers one by one, not knowing where they would be taken.
0:49:14|0:49:20|[Kazumi Akiyama] cried out with her sister, but could only watch helplessly as Nana and the other little girls were taken away.
0:49:34|0:49:41|That day, a soldier took away [Liu Hemei]'s sister, put on his clothes, and turned to leave. [Liu Hemei] sat on the bed, crying helplessly.
0:49:41|0:49:48|The next moment, another soldier approached. [Liu Hemei] looked at him with tears streaming down her face, shaking her head continuously, pleading with the soldier to spare her.
0:49:48|0:49:53|The soldier turned a blind eye and continued to strip off his clothes, proceeding with the assault.
0:49:53|0:49:58|Elder sister [Huang Xiaoli] staggered into the room of [Kazumi Akiyama], who closed the door and helped her onto the bed.
0:50:1|0:50:7|The older sister suddenly knelt down in front of [Kazumi Akiyama].
0:50:57|0:51:5|At this moment, the sound of dinner being served came from outside the door. In order not to be discovered by others, [Kazumi Akiyama] quickly pulled up her sister who was kneeling on the ground and sent her out the door.
0:51:5|0:51:12|The older sister kept struggling, and [Kazumi Akiyama] had to cold-heartedly close the door. [Kazumi Akiyama] leaned against the door, eyes fixed on the tears.
0:51:12|0:51:23|All comfort women were called outside the door, standing by the corridor. Several comfort women knelt in a row in the courtyard, with two comfort station administrators standing behind them, bowing their heads in shame.
0:51:27|0:51:31|The comfort woman kneeling on the ground died tragically in the courtyard, leaving everyone trembling with fear.
0:51:31|0:51:37|The officer warned them that if they tried to escape, they would be executed on the spot like those comfort women.
0:51:37|0:51:42|The officer called the two administrators in front of him, and they knelt down nervously.
0:51:42|0:51:45|The officer held a gun to the male administrator's head and scolded angrily.
0:51:49|0:51:52|Late at night, another group of soldiers arrived at the comfort station by car.
0:51:52|0:51:59|Under the command of the officer, two administrators sat at a small wooden table warmly welcoming them, preparing invoices for the soldiers overnight.
0:52:2|0:52:8|In Kazumi Akiyama's room, a soldier refuses to take safety measures, and Kazumi Akiyama fiercely resists.
0:52:8|0:52:12|[Liu Hemei] heard their argument and ran to the window to listen carefully.
0:52:12|0:52:17|[Kazumi Akiyama] pushed the soldier to the corner of the wall with force, naked, and ran out of the room in the chaos.
0:52:17|0:52:23|She ran barefoot step by step on the bumpy mountain path, full of gravel and rocks.
0:52:24|0:52:30|Tears streamed down her face, but she still furrowed her brow and resolutely ran towards a well.
0:52:30|0:52:34|[Kazumi Akiyama] watches her running sister by the window, but she can't go out to stop her.
0:52:34|0:52:39|The elder sister, though naked, never stopped walking.
0:52:39|0:52:47|She ran to the edge of the well, with disheveled hair, a look of extreme pain on her face, emitting rapid gasps, her hair mixed with tears sticking to her cheeks.
0:52:48|0:52:59|The older sister sobbed, looking at her reflection in the well water, then turned to [Liu Hemei] by the window. Though tears covered her face, a hint of a relieved smile appeared at the corner of her mouth.
0:52:59|0:53:6|Her eyes seemed to be telling [Liu Hemei] that she was finally going to be free, no longer having to endure all the filth here.
0:53:7|0:53:15|She closed her eyes, turned her head in despair, no longer willing to look at the world, and then jumped into the well without hesitation.
0:53:15|0:53:20|The fleeting of a life, the elder sister never got the chance to escape.
0:53:20|0:53:24|[Liu Hemei] witnessed everything that had just happened, crying uncontrollably by the window.
0:53:24|0:53:27|After daybreak, [Liu Hemei] began writing in her diary.
0:53:54|0:54:8|The scene shifts to a terrace, which is the command post of the Japanese army. Several soldiers are standing guard at the railing, with a map hanging on the wall. In the center of the terrace, there is a large table, around which four Japanese officers are seated.
0:54:53|0:55:4|Soldiers who have retreated from the front lines are taking a train back to Myanmar. Trucks are transporting them to the comfort station, where they line up at the entrance as if celebrating a victory.
0:55:12|0:55:15|[Kazumi Akiyama] looked on anxiously at the soldiers.
0:55:15|0:55:19|A soldier walked out of the wooden house with a disheveled coat.
0:55:19|0:55:27|In the room, a girl wearing a white crop top pulled up her pants, dragging her tired body to the door and closing it unsteadily.
0:55:27|0:55:30|The next moment, [Suzuki Masafumi] pushed the door open unexpectedly.
0:55:39|0:55:45|The girl's mouth was already oozing blood, she watched as the officer in front of her adjusted his belt, another round of brutal humiliation.
0:55:56|0:56:3|She was covered in bruises, leaning against the head of the bed with her knees hugged, her eyes full of hatred, breathing heavily with anger.
0:56:3|0:56:12|[Liu Hemei] came to her room, the girl sat on the edge of the bed, holding her right arm with her left hand, with a vacant look in her eyes, and her two twisted braids on her head had come loose.
0:56:12|0:56:19|[Liu Hemei] washed the handkerchief clean, wiping away the scars for her while comforting her.
0:56:43|0:56:49|The girl widened her eyes in disbelief as she heard Kazumi Akiyama say to escape.
0:56:49|0:56:55|In a Japanese military field hospital, the injured Japanese soldier lay on the ground.
0:56:55|0:56:57|The officer spoke to the two soldiers behind him.
0:56:57|0:57:5|Recently, the Japanese army has been continuously attacked by the United States, with a large number of casualties and heavy losses, resulting in a declining combat effectiveness.
0:57:5|0:57:10|The war in China involving Japan has also reached its final stage.
0:57:10|0:57:11|He sighed.
0:57:16|0:57:19|Therefore, it is required to quickly send the comfort women to the front line.
0:57:21|0:57:27|That night, in the comfort station, a group of officers led their men into the courtyard, and all was quiet around them.
0:57:27|0:57:33|He blew the whistle, and the comfort women woke up instantly. Everyone hurriedly put on their clothes and gathered in the courtyard.
0:57:33|0:57:38|Two administrators hurriedly ran up to the officer before they had a chance to put on their coats.
0:57:38|0:57:50|They lined up the comfort women, and the officer handed a piece of paper to the manager, telling him that the front line needed five comfort women each from Japan, China, and Korea, and asked them to gather the women as soon as possible.
0:57:50|0:57:55|The administrator came to the comfort women and selected them one by one to pull them out of the line.
0:57:55|0:58:0|[Kazumi Akiyama] gave a signal to the comfort women, and they all lowered their heads, understanding each other without saying a word.
0:58:1|0:58:3|After the administrator selected the people.
0:58:5|0:58:15|The selected comfort women were taken away by the soldiers, and the manager bowed obsequiously to the officer behind the soldiers, respectfully escorting them out of the comfort station.
0:58:15|0:58:27|At night, the comfort station returned to tranquility. Back in the room, the girl with braided hair secretly opened the door and peeked out. After confirming that there was no one around, she called out to her companions, and several of them tiptoed out.
0:58:41|0:58:44|They called [Liu Hemei] and ran out of the comfort station together.
0:58:44|0:58:49|Unfortunately, the soldiers on guard in the tower spotted them and sounded the alarm.
0:58:49|0:58:55|Suddenly, the alarm bell rang, and the comfort women lifted their skirts, running frantically and desperately forward.
0:58:55|0:59:3|The soldiers collectively mobilized, holding guns as they chased from behind.
0:59:3|0:59:7|The male administrators struggled, without much thought, they could only endure the pain and drill out of the iron chain, running towards the depths of the jungle, with soldiers closely chasing behind.
0:59:25|0:59:31|When they passed through the jungle, ahead was unexpectedly a wide beach with no place to hide.
0:59:31|0:59:38|The Japanese soldiers behind quickly caught up, raised their guns, and aimed at the comfort women who were still running ahead.
0:59:38|0:59:41|The officer pulled the trigger, and [Kazumi Akiyama] shouted at the girl with braided hair.
0:59:52|1:0:1|The girl with braided hair named Xiu Hua stopped, looked back at [Liu Hemei] with a hint of unwillingness in her eyes, then turned and continued running forward.
1:0:5|1:0:9|With a few gunshots, everything disappeared into the darkness.
1:0:9|1:0:14|At night, a Japanese officer leads a group of soldiers to the comfort station to give them a pep talk.
1:0:14|1:0:17|He told the soldiers that they would soon be going into battle.
1:0:17|1:0:22|The officer then patted the shoulder of a young soldier, telling them not to be afraid.
1:0:26|1:0:31|After the communication ended, the young soldier accidentally ran into the room of the female administrator.
1:0:31|1:0:36|He saw the female administrator dressing up, quickly lowered his head to apologize and turned and walked out.
1:0:36|1:0:41|The female administrator called out to him, and the young soldier closed the door and walked over.
1:0:41|1:0:46|The female administrator touched the young soldier's face, praised him for being handsome, and asked if it was his first time at the comfort station.
1:0:47|1:1:1|The young soldier nodded, and the female administrator then asked if he was going to the battlefield tomorrow. The soldier nodded again, and the female administrator said she was willing to serve him tonight, even if he died in battle, it would be an honor.
1:1:1|1:1:18|After a brief flirtation, the female administrator praised the young soldier for his luck, as she never receives soldiers. She asked the young soldier how old he was, and he replied that he was only 16 years old. The female administrator recognized his accent as Fukuoka, but he claimed to be from Saho. This surprised the female administrator.
1:1:18|1:1:25|Because she knew that these soldiers all came from Kyushu, while the young soldier was very certain that he was from Sagami.
1:1:25|1:1:36|The female administrator suddenly had a thought, a hint of panic flashed across her face. She asked the name of the young soldier, who straightened his clothes and happily replied that his name was [Arai Taro].
1:1:36|1:1:41|The female administrator was shocked in an instant, and she confirmed with the young soldier again.
1:1:49|1:2:1|The female administrator inexplicably walked up to the young soldier. She looked at the young soldier in front of her, a tear rolling down her cheek. Trembling, she asked the young soldier to look at her carefully and see if he still recognized her.
1:2:50|1:2:58|Taro realized that he had just done something against human ethics with [Kazumi Akiyama], and collapsed to the ground in despair.
1:3:9|1:3:18|Meizi also pounded her chest in anguish, as Tarou shouted and rushed out the door.
1:3:18|1:3:26|He pushed open the door guarded by soldiers, accidentally fell to the ground, then quickly got up and ran unsteadily towards the outside of the security office.
1:3:26|1:3:29|Meizi is wearing pajamas, chasing Taro from behind.
1:3:35|1:3:41|A group of soldiers quickly surrounded Taro, aiming their guns at him and ordering him to put down his weapon.
1:3:44|1:3:49|At this moment, the officer shouted for his assistant, who walked slowly from behind.
1:3:49|1:3:52|He waved his hand, signaling the soldiers to put down their guns.
1:3:53|1:3:55|Taro still aimed his gun at the officer.
1:3:55|1:3:58|At this moment, Liu Hemei also hurriedly rushed over.
1:4:7|1:4:9|The officer stood with his hands behind his back and replied.
1:4:16|1:4:20|Comfort women were awakened and stood outside the railing watching the battle.
1:4:26|1:4:34|Meizi hurried forward and ran to her younger brother's side. Taro shook his head, and Meizi knelt on the ground, pleading with Taro.
1:4:34|1:4:38|Taro collapsed, threw away the gun in his hand, and knelt in front of his sister.
1:4:46|1:4:49|The siblings knelt on the ground again, embracing each other and crying in pain.
1:4:49|1:4:54|On the other side, Kazumi Akiyama outside the railing was moved to tears by the deep affection between the siblings.
1:4:54|1:5:0|Meizi held her younger brother in her arms with one hand, and he cried loudly on her shoulder.
1:5:4|1:5:9|While her other hand slowly pulled out a hand grenade from her pocket.
1:5:9|1:5:12|Mei Zi wrapped her hands around Taro and didn't say another word.
1:5:12|1:5:15|In the next second, [Meizi] pulled the safety pin from the hand grenade.
1:5:26|1:5:31|Emperor of Japan is forced to announce unconditional surrender.
1:5:36|1:5:45|After Japan's defeat in the war, the officer stationed at the comfort station received an urgent phone call from his superiors, instructing him to immediately dispose of all comfort women on site.
1:5:45|1:5:51|Soon, the comfort women were gathered in an open space, with a machine gun placed in front of them.
1:6:1|1:6:12|Soldiers fired at the comfort women, causing everyone to scatter in panic. Some comfort women were shot and fell to the ground. [Kazumi Akiyama], dressed in a kimono, moved with difficulty but still ran forward desperately.
1:6:12|1:6:22|The officer picked up the gun and aimed at [Kazumi Akiyama], pulling the trigger. A bullet hit [Kazumi Akiyama], causing a moment of pain that made her stop in her tracks, then she turned around and fell straight down.
1:6:23|1:6:33|The scene cuts back to reality, with [Liu Hemei] collapsing on a bench. In her mind, the image of an officer pointing a gun at himself alternates with reality. Her family members approach to comfort [Liu Hemei].
1:7:9|1:7:20|Mingming heard her grandmother's words, suddenly let go of [Kazumi Akiyama]'s hand, as if touching something dirty, tremblingly withdrew it to her chest, stood up shakily, and left the room.
1:7:20|1:7:21|Huang Ziqian used to comfort Mingming.
1:7:51|1:7:55|[Kazumi Akiyama] curled up in Xiaoli's arms like a child who had done something wrong.
1:7:55|1:8:0|Liu Hemei returned home and tore the uncalmed photos on the wall into pieces on the ground.
1:8:0|1:8:7|When he saw the photo of [Liu Hemei], he stopped his hand, bit his lip, and punched the wall repeatedly.
1:8:7|1:8:9|The boyfriend grabbed his hand and immediately stopped him.
1:8:22|1:8:26|The boyfriend sighed and clasped his hands together.
1:8:48|1:8:52|The boyfriend furrowed his brow, lowered his head in silence, lost in thought.
1:9:24|1:9:33|Liu Hemei was about to leave, but his boyfriend stopped him. Seeing Liu Hemei's agitated back, his boyfriend walked up to him and comforted him earnestly.
1:10:9|1:10:14|The scene cuts back to Kazumi Akiyama's home, where Liu Hemei is lying on a recliner covered with a blanket, resting.
1:10:14|1:10:23|[Kazumi Akiyama] walked up to [Liu Hemei] with a bowl of medicine, squatted down, gently shook [Liu Hemei]'s shoulder to wake her up.
1:10:23|1:10:25|[Liu Hemei] opens her eyes and takes the medicine from [Kazumi Akiyama].
1:10:38|1:10:42|Liu Hemei couldn't help but shed tears upon hearing Kazumi Akiyama's comforting words.
1:10:42|1:10:46|[Kazumi Akiyama] looked peacefully at [Liu Hemei], wiping away the tears from the corner of her eyes.
1:10:46|1:10:54|Later, [Liu Hemei] held the medicine in one hand and made a praying gesture in front of her chest, while [Kazumi Akiyama] silently rocked the rocking chair for her.
1:10:54|1:10:57|The next day, the editor-in-chief of the publishing house, [Ms. Su], came to the house.
1:11:10|1:11:13|Upon hearing this, [Liu Hemei] hesitated, and [Editor Suzuki] also hesitated and did not speak again. [Liu Hemei]'s mood was very complicated.
1:12:20|1:12:27|Late at night, [Huang Xiaoli] entered her daughter's room, only to find it pitch black inside. There was a person sitting on the edge of the bed, lost in thought.
1:12:27|1:12:30|Xiaoli turned on the light, sat next to her daughter, and put her arm around her daughter's shoulder.
1:13:1|1:13:6|[Huang Xiaoli] and [Zhang Min] watched with red eyes as [Liu Hemei] stood at the door, anxiously trying to defend herself.
1:13:6|1:13:24|[Liu Hemei] finished speaking, sadly turned and left. That night, under the dark clouds and bright moon, [Zhang Min] sat alone in a bar. She touched the necklace around her neck, a jade pendant given to her by her grandmother during the war, then passed down to her mother, and now to herself, carrying the memories of three generations.
1:13:24|1:13:32|And it was because of this jade pendant that Grandma was able to reunite with her family, but she had just said such disrespectful words.
1:13:32|1:13:41|Mingming returned to the hospital, where her grandmother's diary from the comfort station was placed in front of her. Her boyfriend and [Editor Su] sat on either side of her.
1:15:2|1:15:8|Actually, I really understand Mingming's feelings.
1:15:22|1:15:26|[Xiaoli] tenderly embraced her mother, and soon after, she took Mingming to Yunnan.
1:15:26|1:15:33|Here, they saw the beginning of the film, where [Kazumi Akiyama] saw the statue of a woman kneeling on the ground and crying in front of her at the memorial hall.
1:16:51|1:16:54|At night, [Kazumi Akiyama] leaves a letter for Ziqian.
1:17:37|1:17:44|Ziqian fell asleep on the sofa holding the remote control.
1:17:44|1:17:48|[Kazumi Akiyama] placed the letter next to Ziqian's hand and quietly walked out of the house.
1:17:54|1:18:0|After daybreak, Ziqian saw Xiaoli and [Zhang Min] return from Yunnan, and handed the letter left by [Kazumi Akiyama] to [Zhang Min].
1:18:0|1:18:10|The boyfriend put down the luggage and stood beside [Zhang Min]. [Zhang Min] took the letter, and when she saw that it was written by her grandmother, her legs involuntarily took two steps back.
1:18:10|1:18:16|The family, upon learning that [Liu Hemei] has run away from home, immediately sets out to search for [Liu Hemei] without taking a break.
1:18:16|1:18:22|Xiaoli and [Zhang Min] split up with their boyfriends to search privately on the street under the guidance of Editor Su.
1:18:22|1:18:29|They went to every place where [Liu Hemei] might go, whether it was a crowded subway station or a leisurely entertainment square.
1:18:29|1:18:35|However, in the vast crowd, there was no sign of [Liu Hemei], and [Zhang Min] was running anxiously along the roadside.
1:18:40|1:18:44|The boyfriend received a phone call and learned that an old man wanted to jump into the river.
1:18:44|1:18:47|Since they hurried over, it was [Kazumi Akiyama] on the bridge.
1:19:4|1:19:11|[Kazumi Akiyama] stood at the bridge, holding her head in pain.
1:19:11|1:19:20|[Kazumi Akiyama] looked up at her daughter.
1:19:27|1:19:28|The river water under the bridge is flowing rapidly.
1:19:37|1:19:46|Under the bridge, white waves surged, rolling in from the horizon, with waves chasing and thunder roaring, rushing in darkness on the screen.
1:19:46|1:19:56|After being rescued on the bridge, [Kazumi Akiyama] was taken to the hospital by her family. Ziqian quietly slipped out of the ward, sighed, gently closed the door, and turned to walk towards [Huang Xiaoli].
1:19:56|1:20:3|[Huang Xiaoli] looked up at her grandfather in front of her, his face looking haggard, his once straight posture now somewhat stooped.
1:20:3|1:20:11|He realized that a family had just reunited, but because of his own immaturity, he caused his grandmother to run away from home, almost causing a permanent separation.
1:20:11|1:20:17|He slowly stood up, embraced his grandfather with regret and guilt, and wept on his shoulder.
1:20:17|1:20:31|[Huang Ziqian] said nothing. He looked at Mingming, tears streaming down his face, feeling a pang of sympathy. Without blaming him, he simply patted Mingming's back, supported his arm, and pushed him towards the ward, indicating for Mingming to go in and see his grandmother.
1:20:31|1:20:45|Ziqian watched as Hemei entered the ward and slowly sat down. At that moment, a sudden wave of sorrow overwhelmed her. Her eyes kept blinking, lips tightly closed, and the sadness churned in her throat, making her breathing heavy and chest rise and fall.
1:20:46|1:20:54|He looked at the ward, trying hard to restrain himself from crying out loud, sitting motionless in the chair in the corridor like a statue.
1:20:54|1:21:2|The hospital corridor was empty, with only Huang Ziqian's lonely figure. The surroundings were quiet, as if time had stood still.
1:21:2|1:21:12|At this moment, footsteps could be heard in the distance. [Zhang Min] walked over from around the corner, seeing her father sitting alone. She then walked up to him, squatted down, and held his knees.
1:21:15|1:21:26|Ziqian, with a slightly dejected look, carried her backpack. She looked up at [Zhang Min], nodded, and then [Zhang Min] stood up and sat down next to her father.
1:21:26|1:21:41|Ziqian looked at [Zhang Min], who didn't know how to answer her father. The two looked at each other in silence, and [Zhang Min] could only turn her head in silence.
1:22:2|1:22:6|Zhang Min said nothing more when she saw her father so determined.
1:22:6|1:22:11|She placed both hands on her father's shoulders, and the father and daughter comforted each other.
1:22:11|1:22:22|Later, [Zhang Min] got up and prepared to go to the ward to see her mother. She was worried about her father again, thinking that now that her father was old, he had finally reunited with her mother, only to encounter such a sudden change.
1:22:23|1:22:27|She walked step by step towards the ward, but kept looking back at her father.
1:22:27|1:22:32|[Huang Xiaoli] walked into the ward and saw her mother lying peacefully on the bed, as if asleep.
1:22:32|1:22:37|She caressed her mother's mottled diseased foot, recalling her mother's turbulent life.
1:22:37|1:22:42|As a comfort woman, it is already difficult to survive and come out of the war era alive.
1:22:43|1:22:49|The body has suffered abuse, while the mother just wants to expose the shameless behavior of Japan.
1:22:49|1:22:57|Now, still having to endure misunderstandings from the closest person mentally, a series of tears silently slid down [Huang Xiaoli]'s face.
1:23:4|1:23:9|In the song, [Kazumi Akiyama] lying on the sickbed fell into a dream of that year in Myanmar.
1:23:15|1:23:19|Since the day they parted, it had been decades before the mother and daughter saw each other again.
1:23:19|1:23:24|In the shot, the young Lily and the elderly [Kazumi Akiyama] continuously overlap on the screen.
1:23:24|1:23:29|[Liu Hemei] sat quietly alone on a bench in the corridor, with the sound of Xiaoli's song echoing in their hearts.
1:23:30|1:23:42|At this moment, the screen freezes on the serene face of [Liu Hemei]. She tightly closes her lips, and the wrinkles on her forehead slightly move up and down with her breath, as if she hears the singing of Xiaoli and Minmin.
1:23:42|1:23:49|Although Hemei did not open her eyes, a tear rolled down from the corner of her eye, Xiaoli's hand gently touched [Kazumi Akiyama]'s cheek.
1:23:50|1:24:0|His skin, loosened by the passage of time, clearly shows the signs of aging, with every wrinkle on his face telling the story of his painful past.
1:24:0|1:24:10|Perhaps, the once well-known Western journalist Kazumi Akiyama has gradually faded from the public's memory, while he, as [Liu Hemei], bravely reveals the truth about comfort women to the world in his later years.
1:24:11|1:24:19|The exposure of Japan's lies in the international community and the contribution to world peace will be forever engraved on the monument of history.
1:24:19|1:24:24|At this moment, black and white photos of comfort women from different countries appeared on the screen.
1:24:24|1:24:33|As one comfort woman after another departs, these photos also disappear one by one with them, until the entire picture fades into darkness.
