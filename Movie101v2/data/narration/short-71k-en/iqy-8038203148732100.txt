0:2:22|0:2:25|This is a rural area in North China.
0:2:25|0:2:29|In the distance is a mountain, with several houses at the foot of the mountain.
0:2:29|0:2:33|Nearby is a lake, the water is very clear.
0:2:33|0:2:39|Overlooking the vast land of North China from a high place, the mountains stretch continuously.
0:2:39|0:2:43|At the foot of the mountain lies a thousand acres of fertile land, with flat terrain and dense vegetation.
0:2:45|0:2:55|We now see a river with trees lining both banks, and in the distance, a person is slowly walking while carrying something.
0:2:55|0:3:1|We are now on a hillside with dozens of sheep grazing, among them is an old shepherd.
0:3:21|0:3:28|The millet in the valley below is growing very well, with full and heavy ears swaying in the wind.
0:3:50|0:3:52|The fertile land stretches as far as the eye can see.
0:4:32|0:4:42|Yang Bailao straightened up from the millet field and wiped his face with the cloth on his head.
0:4:42|0:4:47|Xi'er, the daughter of Yang Bailao, lifted her head and wiped the sweat off her forehead.
0:4:47|0:4:51|Yang Bailao pushed aside the millet and walked towards [Xi'er], saying to her.
0:5:1|0:5:14|[Xi'er] took the handkerchief handed to her by her father and wiped the sweat off her forehead and face.
0:5:14|0:5:19|[Xi'er] flicked her braid behind her and lowered her head to continue cutting the bones.
0:5:19|0:5:23|Auntie Wang came with food and met familiar neighbors on the way.
0:5:26|0:5:32|Auntie Wang looked out at the field and saw her son, Da Chun, still working.
0:5:32|0:5:47|Auntie Wang placed the meal in the shade under the tree, wiped her hands with her clothes, and shouted towards the millet field, "Da Chun, Da Chun, my son."
0:5:47|0:5:52|Auntie Wang laboriously stepped onto the field ridge and walked up to Da Chun.
0:5:59|0:6:3|Da Chun wiped the sweat off his forehead and shouted to Xi'er in the distance.
0:6:11|0:6:18|Yang Bailao and his daughter [Xi'er] walked towards the tree, while Auntie Wang carried food and walked to the tree.
0:6:21|0:6:23|Xi'er bends down to help Auntie Wang serve the rice.
0:6:43|0:6:47|Auntie Wang saw Xi'er's hand and said with a heartache.
0:7:2|0:7:10|[Xi'er] buried her head in embarrassment and continued eating. Suddenly, they heard a cough, and the four people eating looked towards Uncle Zhao coming down the hill.
0:7:27|0:7:50|Uncle Zhao waved the whip, walked down the hill, and stood up with a bowl of rice soup in his hand.
0:7:50|0:7:55|Auntie Wang squinted her eyes, threaded the needle, trying to mend clothes, but couldn't get it through.
0:8:3|0:8:9|Auntie Wang touched Xi'er's hair, her eyes full of love.
0:8:9|0:8:13|Uncle Zhao and Old Yang sat on the side smoking opium.
0:8:37|0:8:41|[Da Chun] and [Xi'er] met at first sight, and shyly ran away.
0:9:23|0:9:28|[Xi'er] is sewing clothes under a tree, while [Da Chun] is standing beside him, smiling brightly.
0:9:28|0:9:33|After listening to the elders' chatter, the two of them felt both happy and shy.
0:9:33|0:9:37|Da Chun took the clothes handed to him by Xi'er and ran to the millet field.
0:9:37|0:9:42|[Xi'er] got up and chased after him from behind, the two of them cutting grain together in the field.
0:9:54|0:10:1|[Xi'er] looked up and smiled at [Da Chun], who also smiled back at [Xi'er], making them look very sweet together.
0:10:5|0:10:17|The millet in the field is all ripe, each stalk bending with heavy grains, promising a good harvest this year.
0:10:17|0:10:30|The camera gradually pulls back, and we can see that the weather is very nice today, with clear autumn skies. Dozens of sheep are happily grazing on the hillside, their movements resembling flowing water.
0:10:31|0:10:37|The camera cuts to the road, where a royal carriage comes racing by.
0:10:37|0:10:43|In front of the carriage is a coachman holding a whip and shouting, followed by several attendants.
0:10:43|0:10:51|The electricians trudged along the road with heavy bones on their backs.
0:10:51|0:10:56|The carriage driver shouted loudly from behind, and upon hearing the shout, [Xi'er] turned her head.
0:10:58|0:11:13|[Huang Shiren] saw [Xi'er] happily laughing while waving a fan, but [Xi'er] turned around and walked away unhappily.
0:11:28|0:11:35|Xi'er stopped in her tracks and turned her head upon hearing these words, while Da Chun behind her gritted his teeth, cursed under his breath with his head lowered.
0:11:35|0:11:43|The royal person sat in the carriage, leisurely fanning themselves as the carriage raced along the narrow path through the vast ancient fields.
0:11:43|0:11:48|The royal person walked to the doorstep, where a plaque read "De Guan Qian Qing".
0:12:7|0:12:16|The scene shifts, and we see [Huang Shiren]'s mother sitting at the table, knocking on a wooden fish. The table is full of offerings, and a little maid is fanning her beside.
0:12:26|0:12:33|The old lady wrapped the rosary around her hand, with the help of the little maid, slowly walked to the kang in the outer room and sat down.
0:12:57|0:13:3|[Huang Shiren] sat on the kang, and Mu Renzhi came in to greet him.
0:13:28|0:13:34|[Huang Shiren] stood up.
0:13:34|0:13:39|The old lady stood up and walked into the room, with [Mu Renzhi] holding the account book looking towards [Huang Shiren].
0:14:5|0:14:10|The old lady started knocking the wooden fish again.
0:14:10|0:14:19|The copper gong rang on the drum that the farmers were drying in the shop.
0:14:19|0:14:23|The farmers working in the shop heard the news and put down the fire in their hands.
0:14:27|0:14:34|Surprised and saddened, [Xi'er] carefully sun-dries her family's bones with her father Yang Bailao while wearing a headscarf.
0:14:34|0:14:37|The scene changes, with [Huang Shiren] pointing at the account book.
0:14:52|0:15:7|[Huang Shiren] glared, threw the account book heavily onto the table, and sat down on the chair, fanning himself.
0:15:7|0:15:12|Huang Shiren stopped the fan in his hand and nodded when he heard this.
0:15:12|0:15:19|On the stage, Yang Bailao poured the grains into the bag with a bamboo sieve, while [Xi'er] held the bag and looked at her father with a worried expression.
0:15:33|0:15:40|Yang Bailao took the bag, and [Xi'er] helped her father carry the grain on his shoulders.
0:15:40|0:15:47|At the rent collection scene, Uncle Wu sat on the ground slowly rubbing the bone seeds, wiping tears as he rubbed.
0:15:49|0:15:56|The person collecting rent next to them sat on a chair leisurely drinking tea, smiling and watching the shopkeepers pay their rent.
0:15:56|0:16:4|Yang Bailao brought [Xi'er] over, and someone said to him,
0:16:4|0:16:15|Uncle Wu poured all the bone seeds he had scraped into the rent collection box, but it still wasn't enough.
0:17:30|0:17:34|Mu Renzhi turned his head and looked at [Xi'er].
0:18:4|0:18:12|In a dilapidated house, Yang Bailao sat on the kang smoking a cigarette, the wrinkles on his forehead clearly visible.
0:18:16|0:18:21|[Xi'er] sat on the small stool next to her father and looked at him, saying,
0:18:21|0:18:25|Suddenly, a woman's loud crying could be heard from outside.
0:18:44|0:18:49|[Xi'er] opened the door and walked out, with Yang Bailao following behind.
0:18:49|0:19:5|On the road, they met [Da Chun]'s family and Big Brother Suo.
0:19:5|0:19:11|The camera moved to Yang Bailao's face, and we could see that he was completely stunned.
0:19:12|0:19:21|In the distant wild field, [Auntie Wang] is burning paper and crying bitterly.
0:19:21|0:19:32|Yang Bailao saw this scene, slowly coming back to his senses from shock, and walked to the front of the house.
0:19:32|0:19:38|He fell into contemplation while smoking, and [Auntie Wang] followed to persuade him.
0:20:8|0:20:13|[Da Chun] wrapped the rope around himself in circles, securing it tightly.
0:20:13|0:20:16|Prepared, he held the tools and said to [Xi'er].
0:20:19|0:20:24|On the steep cliff, [Da Chun] successfully descended with the help of ropes and tools.
0:20:24|0:20:35|He searched for suitable miscellaneous trees on the cliff, pulled himself to the tree with a hook, and then took out the machete from his waist to cut the tree.
0:20:35|0:20:38|It's not easy to cut down trees in such a dangerous place.
0:20:38|0:20:45|On one hand, Da Chun's only safety guarantee is a hemp rope, and accidents could easily happen if he's not careful.
0:20:46|0:20:58|On the other hand, Da Chun was dangling in the air, making it even more difficult to control the direction, requiring several attempts to successfully hook onto the miscellaneous tree.
0:20:58|0:21:7|[Xi'er] squats on the grass and ties a rope, looking very nervous because she is worried about [Da Chun]'s safety.
0:21:7|0:21:12|Winter arrived in the blink of an eye, and the distant mountains were covered with a thick layer of snow.
0:21:15|0:21:22|Xi'er and Da Chun are resting on the snowy ground, the firewood is too heavy for Xi'er to get up.
0:21:22|0:21:32|[Da Chun] helped lift the firewood onto his shoulders and carried a bag of firewood home himself.
0:21:32|0:21:36|Under the oil lamp, Xi'er's father, Yang Bailao, is counting money.
0:21:52|0:21:55|Uncle Zhao and Brother Suo are busy in the room.
0:22:4|0:22:8|A little cat trying to steal brine was caught by the scruff of its neck.
0:23:17|0:23:21|Yang Bailao walked on the street, carefully putting away the money.
0:23:21|0:23:23|Suddenly, he saw a red cotton padded jacket.
0:23:33|0:23:36|Yang Bailao dared not speak, nor did he dare to look at that red cotton-padded jacket.
0:23:39|0:23:44|[Da Chun] walked through the bustling crowd with a carrying pole in his hand.
0:23:44|0:23:54|He met Yang Bailao, who was buying a red headband for [Xi'er] at a stall selling hair accessories.
0:23:54|0:24:0|He took out money from his clothes and said to Yang Bailao.
0:24:10|0:24:15|Yang Bailao took the money handed to him by [Da Chun] and walked forward happily.
0:24:15|0:24:27|Da Chun followed behind and arrived at the market entrance. Yang Bailao said to Da Chun.
0:24:27|0:24:30|[Da Chun] took over Yang Bailao's burden and carried it on his back.
0:24:30|0:24:44|[Da Chun] suddenly saw a vendor selling banyan flowers next to him. He happily walked over and picked two good-looking ones.
0:24:44|0:24:46|[Xi'er] is cutting paper in her home.
0:25:0|0:25:4|Chinese subtitles - YK
0:25:54|0:26:0|Da Chun walks into the room and places the red headband and velvet flower in front of Xi'er.
0:26:0|0:26:3|[Xi'er] saw these things, feeling both surprised and shy.
0:26:5|0:26:11|[Da Chun] walked out with a big smile on his face.
0:26:11|0:26:17|The ground was covered with a thick layer of snow, and snowflakes were still falling from the sky.
0:26:17|0:26:23|Yang Bailao stood at the gate of the royal courtyard, brushing off the snow from his body before entering.
0:26:23|0:26:26|On the other side, Xi'er is combing her hair.
0:27:9|0:27:15|[Xi'er] looked at herself in the mirror, feeling delighted, and shyly covered her face with her hands.
0:27:21|0:27:30|Yang Bailao was brought in front of the royal family. He took out a small money pouch from his pocket and placed the money on the table.
0:28:21|0:28:24|Huang Shiren stood up from the chair and spoke.
0:28:45|0:28:54|Lao Mu turned and walked away, Mu Renzhi said to Yang Bailao.
0:29:8|0:29:11|Yang Bailao never expected them to say that.
0:29:11|0:29:15|They were stunned for a moment.
0:29:15|0:29:17|Yang Bailao knelt on the ground, hugging Huang Shiren's leg.
0:30:13|0:30:15|Yang Bailao kneels in front of [Huang Shiren].
0:30:25|0:30:28|[Huang Shiren] kicked Yang Bailao away.
0:30:28|0:30:32|Yang Bailao knelt on the ground, tears filling his eyes.
0:30:32|0:30:39|Mu Renzhi forcefully moved Yang Bailao's fingers, forcing him to press his fingerprint on the document selling his daughter.
0:30:43|0:30:46|Auntie Wang comes to Xi'er's house and shouts from outside the window.
0:30:50|0:30:59|[Xi'er] quickly took off the cotton flower on her head, let down her braids, packed up her things, and happily ran to open the door.
0:30:59|0:31:4|Auntie Wang and Da Chun walk into the house.
0:31:4|0:31:8|At the entrance of the royal gate, [Yang Bailao] vigorously knocked on the door.
0:31:23|0:31:27|On the other side, Auntie Wang, Da Chun, and Xi'er are making dumplings.
0:31:38|0:31:46|[Xi'er] ran to the door and helped her father brush off the snow on his body.
0:31:46|0:31:52|[Xi'er] helped her father [Yang Bailao] sit down and used her right hand to adjust the charcoal fire in the stove.
0:31:52|0:31:58|Auntie Wang asked with concern on the side.
0:31:58|0:32:3|Yang Bailao's eyes were filled with tears.
0:32:3|0:32:4|Zhao Dashu said happily.
0:32:45|0:32:55|Yang Bailao licked the ink on his right index finger, rubbing it back and forth on his knee, trying to clean his finger.
0:33:6|0:33:18|Yang Bailao wiped the tears from his face and walked slowly into the room.
0:33:18|0:33:26|Yang Bailao took the wine handed over by Uncle Zhao, turned his back, and finished it in one gulp. Xi'er handed him the rice bowl.
0:33:26|0:33:32|Yang Bailao took the bowl and sat gently by the kang.
0:34:16|0:34:25|In the twenty-third year of the Republic of China, Xi'er couldn't survive when graduating from the Pei Du family, as Auntie Wang passed away.
0:35:48|0:35:53|Uncle Zhao put down his bowl, put on his coat, and walked to the door.
0:36:3|0:36:17|Uncle Zhao, Auntie Wang, and Da Chun have all gone back. Xi'er closed the door, with heavy snow falling outside and the wind blowing fiercely.
0:36:17|0:36:21|Yang Bailao sat in front of the stove, with [Xi'er] sitting on the kang.
0:36:30|0:36:46|[Xi'er] took a box from the kang and sat down next to her father Yang Bailao. She took out a flower from the box, imagined how it would look on her head, and shyly lowered her head.
0:36:46|0:36:51|[Xi'er] looked at her father, happily leaning against him.
0:36:51|0:36:54|Yang Bailao gently stroked his daughter's hair.
0:36:55|0:37:12|Meanwhile, Auntie Wang is packing clothes for her son Da Chun. Looking at her son sleeping soundly, a smile couldn't help but appear on Auntie Wang's face.
0:37:12|0:37:19|The scene cuts back to Xi'er's home, where Yang Bailao gently strokes Xi'er's face and says to her.
0:37:31|0:37:37|Yang Bailao made the kang bed and said to [Xi'er].
0:37:44|0:37:48|Yang Bailao helped [Xi'er] tuck in the quilt, and [Xi'er] mumbled sleepily.
0:37:56|0:38:8|Yang Bailao looked up, and we saw in the darkness, only his eyes were shining, filled with tears.
0:39:47|0:39:56|Yang Bailao rushed to the door and opened it. In the swirling snow, he seemed to see the royal family again.
0:39:56|0:40:5|Yang Bailao turned around, closed the door helplessly, and sat dejectedly against the wall.
0:40:5|0:40:7|At this moment, he suddenly saw the person on the wall.
0:40:10|0:40:19|Yang Bailao took a few steps towards the brine, then slowly turned around and saw his sleeping daughter, [Xi'er].
0:40:19|0:40:25|[Xi'er] didn't sleep well, her hand was groping for something.
0:40:25|0:40:29|Yang Bailao bent down, looking at the jar of brine, hesitating.
0:40:37|0:40:46|The camera zooms in, revealing the dense wrinkles and crisscrossing tear marks on Yang Bailao's face.
0:40:46|0:40:52|He stared blankly ahead, his eyes filled with despair.
0:40:52|0:40:58|Suddenly, Yang Bailao picked up the jar of brine and drank it down with his head tilted back.
0:40:58|0:41:6|Due to drinking too quickly, some brine dripped from the corner of his mouth, and the brine jar fell to the ground and shattered.
0:41:11|0:41:27|Yang Bailao slowly untied his belt and took off his cotton-padded jacket, gently covering it over Xi'er.
0:41:27|0:41:36|The toxicity of the brine has taken effect. Yang Bailao, in pain, clutches his stomach and struggles to walk towards the door. By the time he reaches the door, he can no longer stand steadily.
0:41:38|0:41:50|Yang Bailao, with tears in his eyes, took one last look at his daughter before disappearing outside the door.
0:41:50|0:41:58|The sky brightened, and [Yang Bailao] lay in the snow, covered with a thin layer of snow.
0:41:58|0:42:5|[Xi'er], [Auntie Wang], Zhao Dashu, and the villagers discovered [Yang Bailao] lying in the snow.
0:42:59|0:42:59|Auntie Wang pulled Xi'er, who was crying in pain.
0:42:59|0:43:8|Auntie Wang pulled Xi'er, who was crying in pain.
0:43:8|0:43:28|Huang Shiren's steward Mu Renzhi walked over, Huang Shiren's steward Mu Renzhi walked over.
0:43:44|0:43:53|The villagers pushed [Da Chun] aside.
0:43:53|0:43:58|Da Chun took out a piece of paper from his pocket and opened it in front of everyone.
0:44:12|0:44:17|Li Chun took the document, looked at the neighbors, and read aloud.
0:44:36|0:44:41|The villagers looked at each other, [Xi'er] knelt on the ground, sobbing uncontrollably.
0:45:34|0:45:39|An elderly person walked to the front from the crowd.
0:46:28|0:46:44|Mu Renzhi went up to take Xi'er away, but the villagers pushed him aside. However, Mu Renzhi's henchman pulled out a gun and glared fiercely at everyone.
0:46:44|0:46:45|Uncle Zhao said angrily.
0:47:3|0:47:9|Auntie Wang helped Xi'er put on a snow-white scarf, leaving Xi'er speechless with emotion.
0:47:19|0:47:30|[Xi'er] had tears streaming down his face as he suddenly knelt down and threw himself onto his father, wailing uncontrollably.
0:47:30|0:47:36|The royal servant walked over, grabbed [Xi'er] by the shoulder, and took him away.
0:47:36|0:47:43|[Xi'er] cried and struggled, but his resistance had no effect.
0:47:46|0:47:52|The servants rudely took off the headscarf on [Xi'er]'s head and threw it on the ground.
0:47:52|0:47:58|[Xi'er] was dragged all the way to the royal palace, crying and shouting.
0:47:58|0:48:7|A royal maid came to inform Auntie Zhang.
0:48:7|0:48:10|Mu Renzhi walked over with some beautiful clothes.
0:48:19|0:48:30|Auntie Zhang walked into the room anxiously, putting on a respectful expression.
0:48:30|0:48:36|Auntie Zhang led [Xi'er] away, while Huang Shiren watched [Xi'er]'s back with gritted teeth.
0:48:39|0:48:50|The old lady glared viciously at [Xi'er], who kept crying with her back turned and did not answer the question.
0:49:14|0:49:20|Upon hearing this, [Huang Shiren] rushed in from outside.
0:49:20|0:49:25|The old lady completely ignores [Huang Shiren].
0:49:25|0:49:32|Watching Auntie Zhang taking away the girl she snatched, [Huang Shiren] dared not defy his mother, feeling anxious and helpless.
0:49:32|0:49:35|In the room, Auntie Zhang asked Xi'er with concern.
0:49:40|0:49:49|[Xi'er] looked up in surprise.
0:49:49|0:50:1|Xi'er remembered something and stopped crying with her head buried.
0:50:7|0:50:12|[Xi'er] turned her head to look at Auntie Zhang, who was patting her back and saying.
0:50:29|0:50:35|[Xi'er] seemed to see hope landing in [Auntie Wang]'s arms, tightly gripping her sleeve.
0:50:47|0:50:50|[Xi'er] cried and said to [Auntie Wang].
0:51:6|0:51:12|The sun in the west gradually set behind the clouds.
0:51:12|0:51:26|Auntie Wang, carrying a hoe, looks ahead and sits alone on the field ridge.
0:51:59|0:52:8|However, in the royal palace unseen by Da Chun, Xi'er is suffering.
0:52:44|0:52:53|During the day, [Xi'er] was punished by the royal family, and at night, the bullied [Xi'er] sat alone under the eaves.
0:53:36|0:53:44|The round moon shines on the high roof, [Xi'er] is sewing under the dim oil lamp.
0:54:37|0:54:42|[Xi'er] buried her head and carefully made shoes for [Da Chun].
0:54:42|0:54:51|[Huang Shiren] suddenly pushed open the door and walked towards [Xi'er] with a sinister smile on his face.
0:54:57|0:55:0|[Huang Shiren] held [Xi'er]'s hand and looked at the shoes.
0:55:6|0:55:18|[Xi'er] hurriedly left the house with her shoes, while [Huang Shiren] stood at the door and gritted his teeth.
0:55:18|0:55:31|Mu Renzhi walked over, [Huang Shiren] whispered something in his ear, and then the scene changed. [Auntie Wang] stood by the well, sighing.
0:55:38|0:55:44|Mu Renzhi brought a few followers, holding hoes, and wantonly destroyed Da Chun's home.
0:55:49|0:55:53|Auntie Wang is very anxious to see her own grain being wasted.
0:56:14|0:56:22|[Da Chun] stared at Mu Renzhi with a mix of anxiety and anger.
0:56:22|0:56:30|The scene shifts, with [Xi'er] adding oil to the bamboo platform in the Buddhist hall.
0:56:30|0:56:34|[Huang Shiren] took a piece of cloth and sneakily peeked outside the house.
0:56:44|0:56:57|Xi'er had just placed the bamboo table on the table when the royal person rudely embraced her from behind.
0:56:57|0:57:4|But Auntie Wang couldn't hear her cries for help. The royal family members laughed mockingly, while covering Xi'er's mouth with a handkerchief.
0:57:5|0:57:13|The plaque hanging in the Buddhist hall reads "Great Compassion and Great Mercy" and "Accumulation of Goodness Hall".
0:57:13|0:57:24|The wind outside was blowing hard, and [Auntie Wang] suddenly woke up. She saw the bed next to her was empty, and immediately got up and walked outside.
0:57:24|0:57:29|[Xi'er] had a piece of cloth stuffed in her mouth, lying on the ground in the Buddha hall unable to move.
0:57:29|0:57:33|Auntie Wang pushed open the door, only to see Xi'er in such a miserable state.
0:57:38|0:57:43|Auntie Wang helped Xi'er untie her bound hands.
0:57:43|0:57:48|Xi'er rushed towards the door motionless.
0:57:57|0:57:59|Xi'er kneels down to Auntie Wang.
0:58:25|0:58:32|[Xi'er] turned her head with tears in her eyes and saw the pair of shoes she had carefully sewn on the table.
0:58:37|0:58:50|She picked up the shoes and held them tightly in her hand.
0:58:50|0:59:0|[Xi'er] did not respond, just bowed her head and continued sewing the shoes.
0:59:0|0:59:4|Auntie Zhang asked a little maid to look after Xi'er while she went to find Da Chun.
0:59:20|0:59:33|Everyone in the room sighed, and suddenly the door opened, and Auntie Zhang walked in.
0:59:33|0:59:35|Uncle Zhao walked out with a pipe and tobacco pouch.
0:59:39|0:59:42|Da Chun and Auntie Wang are both anxious and restless.
0:59:42|0:59:51|After a while, Uncle Zhao returned to the room first, glanced at Auntie Wang, and remained silent.
0:59:59|1:0:2|Auntie Zhang wiped away her tears.
1:0:12|1:0:22|Uncle Zhao finished speaking, lowered his head heavily, [Da Chun] took a deep breath, grabbed the axe and tried to go out, but was stopped by everyone.
1:0:22|1:0:31|Auntie Wang couldn't help but cry, she had long regarded Xi'er as her own daughter.
1:0:31|1:0:35|Da Chun sat down slowly, and Auntie Zhang continued speaking.
1:0:56|1:1:2|Uncle Zhao pondered for a moment, made up his mind decisively, and slammed his leg heavily.
1:1:23|1:1:33|Auntie Zhang told Xi'er about the elopement plan, Da Chun took off his padded jacket and handed it to Dabao, then quietly opened the door and walked into the royal courtyard.
1:1:38|1:1:42|Auntie Zhang lovingly patted Xi'er's hair.
1:1:42|1:1:43|Upon seeing [Xi'er], Dachuan immediately grabbed her hand.
1:1:47|1:2:8|Quick, quick, quick, Da Chun and [Xi'er] hurriedly ran out.
1:2:8|1:2:11|The door was blocked.
1:2:11|1:2:22|[Xi'er] was caught by the royal servants and got into a scuffle with them.
1:2:22|1:2:28|Da Chun punched a royal servant in the face, broke free from the entanglement, and seized the opportunity to run away.
1:2:31|1:2:37|The shepherd shouted loudly, and Da Chun climbed down from the courtyard wall, escaping from the royal palace.
1:2:37|1:2:43|Met Uncle Zhao who was outside providing support, and [Auntie Wang].
1:2:43|1:2:51|Auntie Wang tightly held her son's hand as she looked at the gradually thinning Da Chun.
1:2:56|1:3:4|Auntie Wang leaned against Da Chun, crying in pain. Mr. Zhao said to Da Chun.
1:3:4|1:3:12|[Da Chun] gritted his teeth and left his hometown without looking back.
1:3:12|1:3:22|Transition, [Xi'er] is dragging her weak body while pushing the mill, a maid stumbles.
1:3:25|1:3:33|[Xi'er] supported the millstone and slowly stood up straight.
1:3:33|1:3:42|[Xi'er] has a pale complexion and looks weak.
1:3:42|1:3:49|On the other side, [Da Chun], who left home alone, walked barefoot in the water.
1:3:49|1:3:54|Climbing up the steep hill with a wooden stick, searching for the direction.
1:4:16|1:4:21|[Xi'er] weakly lowered her head and continued to grind the millstone.
1:4:21|1:4:27|Auntie Zhang secretly brought a bowl of rice to see him, carefully afraid of being discovered along the way.
1:4:35|1:4:41|[Da Chun] is using both hands and feet, struggling to move forward on the steep mountain.
1:4:41|1:4:44|Finally, Da Chun arrived at the bank of the Yellow River.
1:4:44|1:4:54|The Yellow River is very wide, with turbulent waves, very dangerous. [Da Chun] can only drift along with the current on the river.
1:4:54|1:4:56|[Da Chun] was deeply moved.
1:4:59|1:5:8|He wanted to find someone to help, and by the river, [Da Chun] found an old man.
1:5:45|1:5:52|[Da Chun] and the old man made a simple sheepskin raft, and the two of them lay on top paddling desperately in the water.
1:5:57|1:6:9|As the sun was about to set, they finally arrived safely on the other side of the Yellow River.
1:6:22|1:6:27|On the high mountain ridge, two Red Army soldiers are standing guard.
1:6:27|1:6:31|On the hillside, there are many miscellaneous trees and grasses.
1:6:31|1:6:38|A ragged young man is climbing up the hill, using both hands and feet.
1:6:38|1:6:43|The Red Army soldier soon spotted him.
1:6:43|1:6:48|As the young man was about to reach the mountaintop, they all reached out their hands and pulled him up.
1:6:50|1:6:52|The young man's clothes were tattered.
1:6:53|1:6:57|After watching it, the Red Army soldier felt very uncomfortable.
1:7:9|1:7:12|The bright red party flag fluttered in the wind.
1:7:12|1:7:17|Before long, [Da Chun] also became a proud soldier of the Red Army.
1:7:18|1:7:29|This is a royal wedding ceremony, with decorations everywhere, grand and magnificent, with large "double happiness" characters embroidered on the door curtains.
1:7:29|1:7:38|Guests dressed in finery entered one after another, chatting loudly in the living room. Servants bustled about, carrying various gifts and delicious dishes.
1:7:46|1:7:54|The royal person wore a big red flower on his chest, a groom's hat on his head, and smiled graciously with folded hands to thank the guests.
1:7:54|1:8:1|[Xi'er] sat alone in a dimly lit small room, quietly working while listening to the lively sounds outside.
1:8:1|1:8:5|Suddenly, the butler [Mu Renzhi] walked in.
1:8:5|1:8:8|[Xi'er] turned her head.
1:8:8|1:8:11|Xi'er hesitated to go, while Mu Renzhi urged her on.
1:8:20|1:8:28|[Xi'er] tossed her braid behind her and walked out listlessly.
1:8:28|1:8:34|[Xi'er] was brought in front of the old lady, who put down her cigarette holder.
1:8:57|1:9:4|Xi'er did not take the clothes and walked out of the door angrily, not even looking at the royal family who had just arrived.
1:9:4|1:9:10|Auntie Zhang, who was passing by, stopped in her tracks. The old lady put away her previous smile and said angrily.
1:9:29|1:9:36|[Xi'er] ran back to her room, secretly packed a parcel, and sat by the kang holding it.
1:9:36|1:9:44|Auntie Zhang eavesdropped outside the door and overheard the conversation between Auntie Wang and [Mu Renzhi], learning that they were about to sell [Xi'er] off, feeling extremely anxious.
1:9:51|1:9:59|Auntie Zhang quickly stole the key to the storeroom and ran to find [Xi'er].
1:10:1|1:10:6|Xi'er hurriedly went up to greet Auntie Zhang when she saw her return.
1:10:16|1:10:22|Upon hearing Auntie Zhang's words, [Xi'er] was first surprised, then very angry.
1:10:22|1:10:30|She didn't expect the royal family to do such outrageous things behind the scenes. She wanted to rush out, but was stopped by Auntie Zhang.
1:10:45|1:10:50|At this moment, [Huang Shiren] and his followers were waiting with sacks and ropes to catch someone.
1:10:50|1:10:56|[Huang Shiren] opens the handkerchief, inside are dozens of silver dollars.
1:11:20|1:11:31|[Xi'er] secretly used the key to unlock the door. After opening it, she didn't know which way to go.
1:11:53|1:12:2|[Xi'er] ran out of the royal palace with a burden on her back. When she looked back, she saw the people from the palace already catching up with lanterns in hand.
1:12:2|1:12:7|He turned his head and ran.
1:12:7|1:12:19|The royal servants carried lanterns, held wooden sticks, and carried guns, chasing relentlessly from behind.
1:12:19|1:12:22|Xi'er ran to the riverbank, with nowhere else to go.
1:12:24|1:12:35|Xi'er took off her shoes and hid in the reeds by the river.
1:12:35|1:12:38|The royal servant carried a lantern, searching by the riverbank.
1:13:0|1:13:18|[Huang Shiren] took the shoes and upon seeing them, [Xi'er] heard [Huang Shiren] say this.
1:13:24|1:13:34|The royal group finally left the riverside, and [Xi'er] quickly emerged from the reeds.
1:13:34|1:13:43|He climbed up the mountain all the way, looking towards the direction of the royal palace, brightly lit and magnificent, filled with resentment.
1:14:43|1:14:51|[Xi'er] ran up the mountain, looking for a place to take shelter. She ran for a long, long time.
1:15:2|1:15:15|Finally, exhausted and unable to walk any further, they could only crawl slowly along the road.
1:15:15|1:15:23|[Xi'er] looked up and saw a cave on the distant barren hill, she wanted to go there to hide.
1:15:27|1:15:33|After walking for who knows how long, [Xi'er] finally arrived at the entrance of the cave.
1:15:33|1:15:47|He walked into the cave with one foot deep and one foot shallow, leaning against the rock wall.
1:15:47|1:15:49|[Xi'er] is lying on a big rock.
1:15:51|1:15:55|He looked into the cave with a face full of fear.
1:15:55|1:16:9|The cave was pitch black, with water droplets continuously falling from the cracks in the cave ceiling, and there were puddles of varying depths on the ground.
1:16:9|1:16:18|Xi'er gingerly made her way deeper into the cave, one foot in the mud and the other in the water, leaning against the peculiar rock formations.
1:16:19|1:16:31|He needs to hide, to a place where the royal family can't find him.
1:16:31|1:16:36|In the cave, spacious and quiet.
1:16:36|1:16:39|No matter what happens, [Xi'er] is very scared.
1:16:52|1:16:58|Suddenly, a small animal darted out from behind the rock.
1:16:58|1:17:7|Xi'er kept backing away in fear, accidentally stepping into the puddle beside her, then quickly climbing onto the rock behind her.
1:17:7|1:17:14|She weakly lay on the rock, her face already unable to distinguish between tears and sweat.
1:17:17|1:17:25|[Xi'er] slowly stood up, drenched in the pouring rain, and walked back to the cave.
1:17:25|1:17:34|Not long after, the harsh winter arrived, with the vegetation withering, the fierce wind howling, and heavy snow falling.
1:17:34|1:17:39|[Xi'er] was already wearing thin clothes, now they are even more tattered.
1:17:41|1:17:56|[Xi'er] had no clothing to prevent the cold, and no fire to keep warm. She could only cover her freezing body with some leaves and grass.
1:19:19|1:19:28|[Xi'er] hung her head in pain, then suddenly lifted it up again, tears on her face frozen into ice beads.
1:19:28|1:19:31|Xi'er remembered there was a grandma temple at the foot of the mountain.
1:19:31|1:19:36|Although the temple is run-down, there are always some offerings.
1:19:36|1:19:37|Eating them will keep us alive and enable us to seek revenge.
1:20:2|1:20:11|Disheveled [Xi'er] struggled to push aside the snow at the entrance of the cave, walking through the snow with difficulty.
1:20:11|1:20:15|Finally, at night, [Xi'er] arrived in front of her grandmother.
1:20:32|1:20:40|There are two incense burners lying on the ground, covered with thick snow, looking like they haven't been used for a long time.
1:20:45|1:20:50|Smoke was rising in the innermost room.
1:20:50|1:20:54|Xi'er walks over.
1:20:54|1:21:2|The room was very dilapidated, with the paper on the doors and windows almost falling off, covered in layers of cobwebs.
1:21:26|1:21:34|Fortunately, there were still some offerings on the table, and the incense in the censer had not been extinguished.
1:21:54|1:22:13|[Xi'er] carefully picked up the incense stick, protecting the flame all the way, and brought the fire back to the cold cave.
1:22:13|1:22:16|With the fire, [Xi'er] can finally keep warm.
1:22:24|1:22:36|The raging fire illuminated Xi'er's emaciated face.
1:22:36|1:22:41|He swung his homemade axe, chopping firewood and making the fire burn brightly.
1:22:57|1:23:12|In spring, the snow melts, the snow water gathers into streams, rivers, and eventually becomes a rushing river. The weather is clear, and the flowers are blooming beautifully.
1:23:17|1:23:41|People saw that the offerings placed in the Grandma Temple were missing, thinking that it was the work of the gods. Therefore, they came to the temple one after another, offering incense and paper money in the outer hall, filling the inner hall's altar with offerings, lighting a few sticks of incense in the censer, and then respectfully bowing down on the ground, praying for the blessings of the gods.
1:23:56|1:24:0|A group of people surrounded an old man holding a cigarette gun, asking curiously.
1:26:13|1:26:15|Upon saying this, [Xi'er], [Auntie Wang], [Huang Shiren], [Da Chun], and [Mu Renzhi] were all stunned.
1:26:38|1:26:45|The people around listening to the story felt both curious and scared, not knowing what was going on.
1:26:45|1:26:54|From then on, the incense in the temple became more and more prosperous, and those who visited the White-Haired Immortal to seek blessings could kneel from the main hall to the front door.
1:27:2|1:27:9|We see [Xi'er] climbing a steep cliff, searching for something to eat.
1:27:9|1:27:12|At this point, her hair had turned completely white.
1:27:14|1:27:37|[Xi'er] had nothing to eat, so he had to search bird nests, catch animals, gather wild fruits, and sometimes go to his grandmother's temple to get offerings in order to sustain his life.
1:27:37|1:27:53|In the cave, there is a fire pit, with [Xi'er] sitting beside it, his face as pale as his long white hair.
1:27:53|1:27:59|The sky was covered with dark clouds, while Japan invaded on the ground.
1:27:59|1:28:9|The Marco Polo Bridge Incident broke out in Japan, and shells landed in the valley, causing people working there to flee in panic.
1:28:17|1:28:28|Thanks to the Eighth Route Army, they bravely repelled the invaders and achieved victory.
1:28:28|1:28:39|Da Chun fought in the Eighth Route Army.
1:28:39|1:28:42|He fought bravely and fearlessly, even when injured, at the forefront.
1:28:50|1:29:16|On a rainy night, Xi'er and Huang Shiren ran to the gate of Grandma's Temple, their umbrellas blown away by the strong wind.
1:29:16|1:29:19|Huang Shiren and Mu Renzhi ran into the inner hall to take shelter from the rain.
1:29:26|1:29:43|Outside the temple, the wind and rain are raging, while inside, it is dark and eerie, looking very terrifying.
1:29:43|1:29:53|Suddenly, there was a loud thunder outside, with flashes of lightning. Two people knelt on the ground in fear, and [Xi'er], with white hair, burst in from outside.
1:30:18|1:30:23|[Huang Shiren] was scared out of his wits, running ahead.
1:30:23|1:30:27|In order not to be caught up by [Xi'er], he rolled down the hill.
1:30:27|1:30:29|[Xi'er] looked down the mountain, speaking bitterly.
1:30:48|1:30:57|In the pond is the Palace Street of Xi'er, the wild valley on the mountain.
1:31:27|1:31:33|In the pouring rain, [Xi'er] with white hair all over her head, ran back to the cave.
1:31:37|1:31:45|On the river bank across, there is a person riding a white horse, while on this side of the river, a farmer is cutting grass.
1:31:45|1:31:50|He saw the army in the distance, dropped the grass, and ran away in fear.
1:31:50|1:31:59|The person from the opposite bank rode a white horse and chased over.
1:32:4|1:32:12|The person riding the horse turned out to be soldier [Da Chun], who saw the old man herding sheep in the distance muttering to himself.
1:33:9|1:33:16|Auntie Wang looks at her son in military uniform.
1:33:48|1:33:54|Auntie Wang started crying while holding her son.
1:34:7|1:34:11|Auntie Wang gently placed her hand on her son's face.
1:34:21|1:34:24|Uncle Zhao stepped forward and said.
1:34:46|1:35:0|The villagers warmly welcome the Eighth Route Army, offering them water and continuously stuffing dry rations into their pockets.
1:35:3|1:35:6|In Huang Shiren's home, Mu Renzhi suddenly rushes into the room.
1:35:26|1:35:29|[Huang Shiren] and Mu Renzhi secretly hid to watch.
1:36:4|1:36:6|Auntie Wang walked into the room at this moment.
1:36:15|1:36:28|Auntie Wang opened the bundle in her arms and took out a pair of shoes made by Xi'er, placing them in Auntie Wang's hands.
1:36:43|1:36:46|For a moment, everyone fell into silence.
1:37:10|1:37:11|Mu Renzhi eavesdrops outside the house.
1:37:36|1:37:42|[Huang Shiren] nodded, took out a handkerchief from his sleeve, and wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and face.
1:37:45|1:37:53|[Huang Shiren] stood up from the stool, hands tucked into his sleeves, looking timid and shy as he greeted softly.
1:38:3|1:38:10|While everyone was busy putting out the fire, [Mu Renzhi] secretly posted a talisman on the tree.
1:38:10|1:38:28|The house was burned down, and [Da Chun] sat angrily on the ground.
1:38:28|1:38:30|Everyone saw that talisman.
1:38:58|1:39:19|In the middle of the night, [Da Chun] and [Da Suo] hid in a corner of the Grandma Temple, waiting for the appearance of the White-Haired Fairy.
1:39:19|1:39:23|Da Chun couldn't bear it and wanted to go out to take a look, but Xi'er held her back.
1:39:26|1:39:38|Soon, a tall figure appeared at the door, it was the white-haired [Xi'er].
1:39:38|1:39:46|As usual, she rushed to the altar when she made sure no one was watching.
1:39:46|1:39:50|She stood on the offering table to take the offerings.
1:39:50|1:39:55|[Da Chun] jumped out and swung his knife, causing [Xi'er] to flee in panic from Grandma's Temple.
1:40:0|1:40:10|[Da Suo] and [Da Chun] are holding torches and long knives, chasing after.
1:40:10|1:40:18|Da Chun fired a few shots from a distance.
1:40:18|1:40:20|[Xi'er] was startled and ran even faster.
1:40:27|1:40:32|Da Chun and Da Suo ran to the foot of the cliff, looked up, and saw Xi'er had already climbed to the edge of the cave on the mountaintop.
1:40:55|1:41:19|[Da Chun] and Dasuo followed [Xi'er] to the entrance of the cave, holding torches as they walked in.
1:41:19|1:41:24|Inside the cave, it was dark and cold, with [Xi'er] curled up in a pile of leaves.
1:41:43|1:41:51|To avoid being searched by Da Chun and Dasuo, Xi'er hid in a dark corner above a cave.
1:42:4|1:42:18|Da Chun and Da Suo walked to the place where Xi'er had just avoided, and found an unburned fire pit on the ground.
1:42:27|1:42:30|Upon hearing the sound, [Da Chun] and Auntie Wang both looked up to search.
1:42:37|1:42:43|[Xi'er] peeked out from the corner with tears in her eyes.
1:42:43|1:42:50|[Da Chun] took the torch and walked towards the direction of the sound.
1:42:50|1:42:58|The firelight illuminated the face of [Xi'er], the once youthful and beautiful face now looking incredibly weathered.
1:43:3|1:43:16|[Da Chun] approached with a torch in hand, and saw the person he had been longing for day and night. [Xi'er] cried out in tears.
1:43:19|1:43:22|[Xi'er] fainted because she was too excited.
1:43:22|1:43:26|[Da Chun] hurriedly held him in his arms, calling his name repeatedly.
1:43:33|1:43:39|[Xi'er] woke up, weakly looking at [Da Chun] with tears in his eyes.
1:45:22|1:45:34|In front of the people, the two troublemakers who acted against the concubines, [Mu Renzhi] from the royal family, were taken away for execution. The royal merit monument and various plaques hanging were all knocked down.
1:45:38|1:45:46|People lit a big fire, burning the rented items and signs to ashes, everyone clapped and cheered.
1:45:55|1:46:4|It's another sunny day. Passing through the trees with blossoming flowers, we can see Da Chun and Xi'er tying up straw.
1:46:4|1:46:10|Auntie Wang watched the loving couple and couldn't stop smiling.
1:46:10|1:46:15|[Xi'er] took off the scarf on her head, revealing her shiny black hair.
1:46:15|1:46:19|She handed the handkerchief to [Da Chun] and watched the villagers working hard in the distance.
1:46:26|1:46:34|[Da Chun] carried two bundles of straw in front, with [Xi'er] holding a bunch of straw following behind.
1:46:34|1:46:41|He laughed happily, his eyes filled with hope and anticipation for a better life in the future.
