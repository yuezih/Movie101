0:0:57|0:1:2|Although it is already spring, the trees are still bare, without a single leaf.
0:1:2|0:1:15|A young woman in a cheongsam dress is slowly walking towards from the overgrown path with a basket in her hand. The surrounding environment is in ruins, the once sturdy city walls made of stone bricks have long lost their former strictness.
0:1:16|0:1:29|Now, only the broken walls are left struggling to support, like an old man guarding the city tremblingly. Under the hard branches, this stumbling path appears even more lifeless, as if spring has never visited this place.
0:1:29|0:1:41|In the next scene, in a small courtyard, a clean-shaven man in a robe struggles to move a plaque from a corner filled with clutter, and hangs it on a pillar on the side.
0:1:41|0:1:52|The strenuous movements caused the neatly arranged wood in the corner to scatter, making a loud noise as it fell to the ground. However, the man paid no attention to the scattered wood, focusing only on the task at hand.
0:1:52|0:1:59|His movements were extremely clumsy, with occasional coughs interrupting his unskilled actions, making him look very awkward.
0:1:59|0:2:6|Although the courtyard may look a bit run-down now, upon closer inspection, whether it's the intricately carved cloisters in the yard or the exquisite pavilion, they are all very exquisite.
0:2:7|0:2:14|In the distance, the sound of a train whistle suddenly came. [Zhou Yuwen] looked surprised in the direction of the whistle, but she still didn't let go of the fire in her hand.
0:2:14|0:2:22|At the same time, inside the train station, a train slowly came to a stop at the platform, and a man in a suit stepped down from the train.
0:2:22|0:2:29|He was wearing a three-piece suit, holding a suitcase in each hand. After getting off the car, he looked around and then walked steadily towards the small path on the left.
0:2:29|0:2:32|He walked briskly, showing no signs of fatigue from the long journey.
0:3:11|0:3:19|The wind chime hanging at the entrance of the pharmacy swayed with the wind, making a clear and pleasant sound, and faint cries of selling medicine and bargaining could still be heard.
0:3:19|0:3:26|The woman in cheongsam skillfully stepped over the threshold, took the wrapped Chinese medicine from the outer wall, put the medicine into the vegetable basket, and then turned and left.
0:3:29|0:3:35|Accompanied by bird songs and truck horns, at this moment, [Zhang Zhichen] has arrived at the path by the lake.
0:3:35|0:3:39|Sunlight falls on him, his steps swift like a flying sword, his spirits high.
0:3:39|0:3:46|In the courtyard, [Lao Huang] has found the young master, who turns out to be the flat-headed man who was just arranging the plaques.
0:3:46|0:3:53|Master Zhou Yuwen was only wearing a long robe, and Lao Huang quickened his pace, showing a slightly reproachful concern.
0:3:58|0:4:9|The master borrowed a scarf, tied it around his neck, and walked towards the seats in the pavilion, slowly sitting down in the shade of the long bench.
0:4:9|0:4:13|He looked at the flowers and trees in the courtyard, lost in thought as he murmured to himself.
0:5:21|0:5:26|[Lao Huang] took the scarf handed to him by the young master and stood behind him, nodding in agreement.
0:5:26|0:5:36|The two were talking when a woman in a cheongsam appeared at the end of the dark and narrow alley, pushing open the courtyard gate with her unbarred hand and walking quietly into the courtyard.
0:5:36|0:5:42|The old wooden door creaked as she moved.
0:5:42|0:5:48|The woman entered the room, ignoring the young master and the old man in the pavilion, and walked straight ahead without looking sideways.
0:6:7|0:6:11|[Zhou Yuwen] heard Dad was about to leave, and the young master quickly stopped him.
0:6:23|0:6:29|[Zhou Yuwen] heard this and turned to walk to the young master's side, handing him the medicine packet at the top of the basket.
0:6:29|0:6:37|Young Master Zhou Yuwen took the herbal medicine package wrapped in oil paper, sighed with a sense of loss.
0:6:49|0:6:53|[Zhou Yuwen] slings the basket back onto her arm, instructing that her younger sister will come back for lunch.
0:6:53|0:6:56|After she finished explaining the situation, she turned around and left.
0:6:56|0:7:2|After the young master sighed and threw the medicine pouch on the ground, he turned his head to the side.
0:7:2|0:7:8|[Zhou Yuwen] could only pick up the medicine packet from the ground and say to the young master.
0:7:18|0:7:26|Upon hearing Zhou Yuwen's words, Young Master paused for a moment, lowered his head without making eye contact with Yuwen, and turned away somewhat helplessly.
0:7:26|0:7:31|[Zhou Yuwen] handed the medicine she had just picked up to the young master before turning around and leaving again.
0:7:31|0:7:35|After taking the medicine, Master Zhou Yuwen childishly threw the medicine packet on the ground again.
0:7:35|0:7:40|This time, [Zhou Yuwen] did not turn back to pick up the medicine bag, but left without looking back.
0:7:40|0:7:47|The young master saw him leave without any reluctance, then turned back to the pavilion and sat down, looking straight ahead.
0:7:47|0:8:1|The man in a suit has arrived at a desolate village, which looks like it has just experienced a war. There is not a single intact wall to be seen, the whole village is empty and lifeless, except for a few bird calls bringing some vitality to the village.
0:8:2|0:8:15|He stopped in front of a relatively intact courtyard, put down a suitcase, and skillfully walked to the front door. After peering inside through the crack in the door, he raised his hand and knocked heavily on the latch.
0:8:15|0:8:22|In the room, [Zhou Yuwen] had changed into a cheongsam. She was buttoning up the dress while walking around the thin partition towards the dressing table.
0:8:24|0:8:31|He didn't sit down in a hurry, but stood in front of the mirror for a long time to carefully tidy himself up, and then slowly bent down to sit down.
0:8:31|0:8:42|Upon hearing the knocking at the door, he did not react hastily. Instead, he picked up the refreshing oil from the dressing table, dabbed a little with his pinky finger, and gently placed it in front of his finely embroidered nose.
0:8:42|0:8:47|Unfortunately, the cooling oil didn't work, and [Zhou Yuwen] still yawned.
0:8:47|0:8:52|The knocking on the door grew louder and louder, prompting him to shout loudly at [Lao Huang] outside the door.
0:9:1|0:9:10|The man in a suit, finding no one to open the door, skillfully carried the box and walked into the alley, passing by [Lao Huang] who had just arrived to open the door.
0:9:10|0:9:20|[Lao Huang] pushed open the door, found no one around, and came out of the courtyard in confusion. After looking around the empty space in front of the courtyard gate for a while and making sure there was no one, he returned to the courtyard and closed the door again.
0:9:21|0:9:28|In the attic of the courtyard, [Zhou Yuwen] opened the bamboo curtain and sat elegantly on the bench below the window, embroidering.
0:9:28|0:9:34|Her movements were gentle and smooth, as if she was holding not a piece of silk, but a precious Western treasure.
0:9:34|0:9:42|The delicate embroidery needle weaved through the silk fabric, accompanied by the chirping of birds, making her appear elegant and refined, a true lady of high society.
0:9:44|0:9:48|At the alley entrance, the man in a suit arrived at the back door where [Zhou Yuwen] had just passed by.
0:9:48|0:9:52|After confirming at the door, the luggage was placed on the steps.
0:9:52|0:9:57|After looking around the alley for a few moments, [Zhou Yuwen] knocked on the door latch.
0:9:57|0:9:59|After a long time, the young master's voice was finally heard.
0:10:2|0:10:8|When he was at his wit's end, he suddenly found a hole in the wall, so he entered through the hole.
0:10:8|0:10:12|In the courtyard, just as she entered, she encountered the young master who came to open the door.
0:10:12|0:10:15|He walked quickly to the young master's side and said excitedly.
0:11:9|0:11:12|[Zhou Yuwen] did not respond, so [Lao Huang] raised his voice.
0:11:38|0:11:41|In the courtyard, [Dai Liyan] and [Zhang Zhichen] were still reminiscing.
0:13:7|0:13:11|[Zhang Zhichen] picks up the luggage in the corner, and [Lao Huang] quickly says.
0:13:41|0:13:45|[Lao Huang] said, "Just leave."
0:13:45|0:13:50|Dai Liyan and Zhang Zhichen sat down in the pavilion, and Zhang Zhichen suddenly thought of something.
0:13:59|0:14:1|In the pavilion, Lao Huang found Yuwen.
0:14:26|0:14:32|After Lao Huang left, Zhou Yuwen returned to her room and carefully dressed up in front of a large dressing mirror.
0:14:50|0:14:59|He was wearing a dark floral cheongsam, with a beautifully crafted jade bracelet on his wrist, and a small jade pendant dangling from his delicate earlobes.
0:14:59|0:15:7|At this moment, [Zhou Yuwen] is delicately spraying perfume on both sides of her slender neck, slowly tying a scarf that matches her cheongsam dress by her side.
0:15:8|0:15:13|On the originally empty ring finger, he also put on a shiny diamond ring.
0:15:13|0:15:23|After finishing dressing up, [Zhou Yuwen] glanced at the half-height mirror, made sure everything was in place, and then walked out the door leisurely, with the sun shining just right at that moment.
0:15:23|0:15:28|[Zhou Yuwen] walked through the sunlit stone corridor and turned a corner to enter the courtyard.
0:15:28|0:15:35|Dai [Zhang Zhichen] and [Zhou Yuwen] were still catching up, while Dai Liyan heard their conversation and walked towards them in silence.
0:15:36|0:15:42|At this moment, [Zhang Zhichen], who was leaning against the back of the chair in the pavilion, noticed [Zhou Yuwen] approaching.
0:15:42|0:15:44|He quickly stood up to greet them.
0:15:44|0:15:47|His actions interrupted the speech of the agent Yan.
0:15:47|0:15:50|Dai Liyan also saw Zhou Yuwen following his actions.
0:15:50|0:15:52|He led [Zhang Zhichen] towards [Zhou Yuwen] and introduced.
0:16:35|0:16:39|After Dai Liyan spoke, Zhou Yuwen had no choice but to return the suitcase to Zhang Zhichen.
0:16:39|0:16:46|Seeing Zhichen taking the box, Dai Liyan then bent over Zhichen's shoulder and walked up the corridor towards the inner room.
0:16:46|0:16:53|[Zhou Yuwen] did not rush to catch up with them. Instead, it was Zhang Zhichen who, as he turned the corner of the corridor, took a deep look at [Zhou Yuwen].
0:16:57|0:17:3|[Zhou Yuwen] immediately lowered her head and stopped looking at [Zhang Zhichen] the moment she saw his eyes.
0:17:3|0:17:6|He followed the two at an extremely slow pace.
0:17:6|0:17:15|[Lao Huang] pushed open the door, ushered [Dai Liyan] and [Zhang Zhichen] into the house, and then opened the windows one by one, letting the sunlight pour in and illuminate the dim room.
0:17:54|0:18:0|After Dai Liyan finished speaking with a bitter smile, he walked into the dressing room, followed quickly by [Zhang Zhichen].
0:18:0|0:18:7|The furnishings in the room were very simple, indicating that it had been uninhabited for a long time.
0:18:7|0:18:13|Dai Liyan casually grabbed the spider web hanging on the wooden cabinet and said nostalgically to Zhang Zhichen.
0:18:33|0:18:36|They were talking, but looking at Zhou Yuwen outside the window.
0:18:58|0:19:0|[Zhang Zhichen] hesitated for a few seconds before speaking.
0:19:25|0:19:35|Outside the bed, [Zhou Yuwen] carefully brushed away the dust on the carved wooden door with courage, the sunlight shining on her veiled face, so gentle and tranquil.
0:19:35|0:19:37|In the backyard, a little girl runs into the courtyard.
0:19:55|0:20:3|Every time Lao Huang finishes speaking, the little girl rushes into the study. Zhou Yuwen sees the little girl running over in a hurry and greets her.
0:20:26|0:20:29|The little girl ran into [Zhang Zhichen] after passing [Dai Liyan].
0:20:33|0:20:39|The little girl who hit someone was a bit at a loss. She came to the outer room with [Zhang Zhichen] and secretly lit a pillow.
0:20:39|0:20:42|[Zhang Zhichen] smiled gently, indicating something.
0:21:52|0:22:2|[Zhang Zhichen] looked at the flowers without saying a word, then [Lao Huang] continued.
0:22:2|0:22:9|[Zhang Zhichen] walked up to the orchid carefully, listening to the sound of water being poured into the basin by [Lao Huang], and turned his head to speak.
0:22:33|0:22:45|In Dai Liyan's room, she was reading by the dim light of a desk lamp, with a candlestick standing by unlit. The occasional coughing reminded Dai Liyan of her frail physical condition.
0:22:48|0:22:59|[Zhou Yuwen] walked past the room where [Dai Liyan] was acting as a substitute for salt. She heard the voice, stood by the window for a moment, but did not enter the room to check. She continued walking along the corridor towards elsewhere.
0:22:59|0:23:8|He was still wearing the cheongsam with a dark floral pattern that he wore during the day, with moonlight shining on his back, the pattern on the cheongsam faintly visible, making him look elegant and graceful.
0:23:10|0:23:19|In the study, [Zhang Zhichen] felt like he had lost his soul since [Lao Huang] left. He closed the door, sat down by the orchid shelf, and pondered with his head down.
0:23:19|0:23:25|After a while, a gentle knocking sound came from the door. He shook himself out of his daze and walked to the door in three steps.
0:23:30|0:23:34|[Zhou Yuwen] walked slowly into the room and placed the hot water kettle on the table.
0:23:34|0:23:37|Zhang Zhichen saw the hot water bottle in his hand.
0:23:38|0:23:40|[Zhou Yuwen] glanced at Zhang Zhichen.
0:23:45|0:23:47|[Zhou Yuwen] pushed the water bottle onto the table.
0:23:53|0:23:58|[Zhou Yuwen] ignored these words and instead turned around, casting a glance at the dim room.
0:24:5|0:24:10|Zhang Zhichen slowly walked up behind [Zhou Yuwen], who had her back to him.
0:24:10|0:24:12|Neither of them spoke a word.
0:24:12|0:24:18|After maintaining this posture for a long time, Zhang Zhichen slowly began to speak.
0:24:30|0:24:39|[Zhou Yuwen] put down the candle, walked to the other side of the table to the shelf with orchids, and opened the distance with [Zhang Zhichen].
0:24:39|0:24:44|Half turned, looking at Zhang Zhichen who was standing with his arm around the waist.
0:24:45|0:24:48|Zhang Zhichen immediately caught up with Zhou Yuwen.
0:24:55|0:24:59|Zhang Zhichen awkwardly tried to stop Zhou Yuwen.
0:25:4|0:25:5|Yuwen Zhou smiled lightly.
0:25:6|0:25:8|Utterance, Yuwen walks out of the room.
0:25:12|0:25:18|Zhang Zhichen watched Zhou Yuwen leave, standing by the window and gazing at her until her figure disappeared in the moonlight.
0:25:21|0:25:25|After a while, Zhou Yuwen appeared in the corridor wearing a small coat.
0:25:25|0:25:32|He had a heavy blanket draped over his arm as he passed by [Dai Liyan]'s room, where the sound of his rapid coughing could be heard.
0:25:32|0:25:37|[Zhou Yuwen] stopped at the door, sighed, then quietly left with the blanket tucked under her arm.
0:25:40|0:25:46|In the study, Zhang Zhichen saw Zhou Yuwen bringing a blanket from outside and quickly went up to open the door for him.
0:25:46|0:25:54|[Zhou Yuwen] entered the room and did not pay attention to Zhang Zhichen, but walked towards the bed and carefully spread out the blanket.
0:25:54|0:26:1|Zhang Zhichen also remained silent, quietly standing behind [Zhou Yuwen], waiting for her to speak.
0:26:1|0:26:5|[Zhou Yuwen] asked only after making the bed.
0:26:10|0:26:18|Zhang Zhichen nervously twirled the needle.
0:26:18|0:26:25|Zhang Zhichen looked confidently at [Zhou Yuwen].
0:26:25|0:26:28|[Zhou Yuwen] did not show a happy expression.
0:26:28|0:26:33|Until the two finished speaking, [Zhou Yuwen] did not turn around, but looked directly at Zhang Zhichen.
0:26:33|0:26:37|Zhang Zhichen kept staring at Zhou Yuwen as if he wanted to see through him.
0:26:39|0:26:42|The two maintained this posture, remaining silent.
0:26:42|0:26:48|Finally, Zhang Zhichen turned around and looked out the window when he saw that he had no response.
0:26:48|0:27:0|[Lao Huang] has finished patrolling the courtyard at this time. He is carrying an oil lamp and decisively extinguishes the outdoor lights. With a creak, he closes the old wooden gate from the inside.
0:27:0|0:27:7|His body is getting weaker and his temper is getting worse.
0:27:17|0:27:20|Yuwen Zhou let go of their hands held together.
0:27:22|0:27:27|Zhang Zhichen noticed Zhou Yuwen's movements and quietly took a step back.
0:27:56|0:28:7|[Zhou Yuwen] said, "Turn around and quickly pull the light above your head."
0:28:7|0:28:19|[Zhou Yuwen] picked up the bamboo stand on the small table and walked towards the desk with candles. Skillfully assembling the bamboo stand and candle, she took the match from [Zhang Zhichen] and lit the candle with a hiss.
0:28:22|0:28:25|The candlelight and the lamplight illuminated them in a gentle manner.
0:28:25|0:28:30|Zhang Zhichen looks at [Zhou Yuwen].
0:28:31|0:28:34|[Zhou Yuwen] extinguished the match in her hand.
0:28:34|0:28:40|Zhang Zhichen picked up a stool to hand it to [Zhou Yuwen], only to see that [Zhou Yuwen] had already sat down at the foot of the bed.
0:28:40|0:28:46|He came to the bedside, wanting to sit next to [Zhou Yuwen], but [Zhou Yuwen] shrank back slightly in resistance.
0:28:47|0:28:55|Zhang Zhichen awkwardly tidied up the bedding, then turned around and walked to the other corner of the bed.
0:28:55|0:29:0|Zhang Zhichen sat down and nervously rubbed his hands.
0:29:3|0:29:8|He was speaking when the overhead light suddenly flickered and went out.
0:29:8|0:29:12|The room suddenly darkened, with only a candle as the sole source of light.
0:29:14|0:29:19|[Zhou Yuwen] saw the room darken and, letting down her guard, she quietly sobbed.
0:29:19|0:29:23|He covered his face with one hand, preventing tears from flowing.
0:29:23|0:29:26|Zhang Zhichen, upon seeing the situation, immediately stood up to comfort him.
0:29:26|0:29:31|He had just placed his left hand on Zhou Yuwen's shoulder, but Zhou Yuwen suddenly wanted to leave.
0:29:31|0:29:35|Zhang Zhichen followed behind him blankly, saying nothing.
0:29:35|0:29:39|[Zhou Yuwen] raised her hand to stop Zhang Zhichen and said.
0:29:42|0:29:46|[Zhou Yuwen] said, "Open the door, and walked out of the study without looking back."
0:29:46|0:29:53|Zhang Zhichen came to his senses and quickly caught up with Zhou Yuwen's footsteps, standing outside the door staring blankly at Zhou Yuwen's disappearing figure.
0:29:56|0:30:5|Early the next morning, [Zhou Yuwen] changed into a simple cheongsam, her hair tied up with a square scarf fluttering in the wind. At this moment, she was standing by the city wall, gazing into the distance.
0:30:5|0:30:15|In the misty morning of the small town, the distant scenery was not very clear. He kept looking up from time to time, making it hard to tell what was on his mind at the moment.
0:30:15|0:30:18|Outside the designated driver's yard, [Lao Huang] is opening the door to dump last night's medicine residue.
0:30:20|0:30:23|In the courtyard, Zhang Zhichen also changed into a new suit.
0:30:23|0:30:28|As soon as the door opened, he ran into [Dai Xiu] who came to find him.
0:32:21|0:32:30|Don't rush to hand the hand warmer to [Dai Liyan].
0:33:42|0:33:46|[Dai Xiu] accidentally said the wrong thing and quickly corrected herself.
0:34:42|0:34:46|On the small road leading to Xuzhuang, [Dai Liyan] and [Zhang Zhichen] were panting as they ran from behind.
0:34:58|0:35:9|Dai Liyan stumbled while going downhill, Zhang Zhichen quickly reached out to help, but accidentally ended up catching Dai Xiu and Zhou Yuwen who were walking behind.
0:35:9|0:35:12|Down the slope, [Zhou Yuwen] let go of [Zhang Zhichen]'s hand as if being electrified.
0:35:22|0:35:35|Dai Xiaomei urged on, as Zhou Yuwen struggled up the hill. Zhang Zhichen glanced back at the lagging Zhou Yuwen, but did not help her. Instead, Dai Xiaomei reached out and gave Zhou Yuwen a hand.
0:35:35|0:35:41|On the vast and boundless lake, they set sail in a boat, and the singing of [Dai Xiu] drifted over like a flute.
0:37:1|0:37:7|The group had a great time, singing with the younger sister, while [Zhang Zhichen] rowed the boat reluctantly.
0:37:7|0:37:12|Late at night, after finishing washing up, [Dai Liyan] walked up to the mirror in his pajamas and spoke to his reflection.
0:37:47|0:37:51|[Dai Xiu] took the medicine from [Zhou Yuwen]'s hand, but immediately spat it out after taking a sip.
0:37:51|0:37:56|[Zhou Yuwen] quickly handed him the prepared handkerchief, [Dai Xiu] wiped his mouth and threw the handkerchief on the table.
0:37:58|0:38:5|[Zhou Yuwen] heard this without saying a word, tidied up the table that was messed up by taking medicine just now, picked up the tray and turned to leave.
0:38:5|0:38:10|[Dai Xiu] did not try to stop him when he left, instead she pulled up the blanket and leaned against the head of the bed, deep in thought.
0:38:12|0:38:21|The entire Dai family compound was ready to go to sleep, the courtyard was quiet and peaceful. [Zhang Zhichen], who was staying in the study, was washing and wiping his body.
0:38:21|0:38:30|[Zhou Yuwen] returned to the room and had already freshened up. At this moment, taking advantage of the electricity not being cut off yet, she sat in front of the half-height dressing mirror carefully tidying up.
0:38:30|0:38:36|As he was about to wipe his face, [Dai Xiu], who had just finished showering, walked in while drying his hair.
0:38:40|0:38:46|After closing the door, Da Xiaomei bounced over to stand behind [Zhou Yuwen], placing her hand on Zhou Yuwen's shoulder.
0:38:48|0:38:52|[Zhou Yuwen] smiled slightly upon hearing this, stood up, and gave up her seat.
0:38:52|0:38:59|Zhou Yuwen took the towel from Damao's hand and gently dried her wet hair in front of the dressing table.
0:39:2|0:39:5|Zhou Yuwen glanced at the large mirror in front of her and continued speaking.
0:39:32|0:39:34|Dai Xiaomei turned her head shyly to look at [Zhou Yuwen].
0:39:40|0:39:42|[Zhou Yuwen] unscrewed the bottle of hair oil in her hand.
0:39:42|0:39:49|[Zhang Zhichen], he lives in a big city and has seen the world.
0:40:4|0:40:6|[Zhou Yuwen] leaned against the desk and joked around.
0:40:10|0:40:15|Dai Liyan was a little shy when she heard what he said.
0:40:15|0:40:18|After Dada and Xiaomei finished speaking, [Zhou Yuwen] stared at the mirror in silence.
0:40:18|0:40:24|Zhou Yuwen looked at herself in the mirror after looking at Dai Liyan, and smiled somewhat shyly.
0:40:24|0:40:29|The two sisters-in-law whispered to each other, while [Zhang Zhichen] in the study was tidying up the luggage alone.
0:40:29|0:40:33|The alarm sounded in the distance, reminding everyone of the impending power outage.
0:40:35|0:40:39|At 12 o'clock, the lights in the room flickered a few times and then slowly went out.
0:40:39|0:40:50|[Zhang Zhichen] was not in a hurry. He first tidied up the clothes in his hands, then walked to the table to light the candle with a match, and finally sat at the corner of the bed in a daze.
0:40:50|0:40:55|The alarm was still ringing, echoing in the silent room, making it a bit eerie.
0:40:55|0:41:1|The night was already late, and [Zhang Zhichen] was not in a hurry to sleep, not knowing how long he would maintain this absent-minded posture.
0:41:3|0:41:9|A new day dawns, [Zhou Yuwen] picks up the basket hanging on the cabinet, ready to go grocery shopping.
0:41:9|0:41:12|[Zhang Zhichen] happened to meet by chance.
0:41:12|0:41:14|[Zhang Zhichen] smiled and said to him.
0:41:37|0:41:43|[Zhou Yuwen] smiled slightly in agreement, then disappeared at the end of the corridor with a basket of vegetables.
0:41:43|0:41:50|[Zhang Zhichen] looked at his gradually disappearing figure with some joy until he completely disappeared from sight.
0:41:50|0:42:12|After breakfast, [Zhou Yuwen] and [Zhang Zhichen] met as planned. [Zhou Yuwen] had already stood up, but neither of them let go of the hands they had just held onto while helping each other up.
0:42:23|0:42:29|[Zhou Yuwen] responded with a smile, and [Zhang Zhichen] walked up to him, staring at him.
0:42:41|0:42:47|[Zhou Yuwen] raised her head to look elsewhere, and smiled lightly at [Zhang Zhichen]'s face.
0:42:47|0:42:50|After he finished speaking, neither of them spoke again.
0:42:50|0:42:53|[Zhang Zhichen] suddenly turned around and walked along the city wall.
0:42:53|0:42:59|[Zhou Yuwen] followed him silently, with birds chirping around, making the atmosphere between the two even more serene.
0:43:1|0:43:8|On the roadside, a scarf is hanging on a tree [Lao Huang], swaying lonely in the wind.
0:43:8|0:43:16|[Zhang Zhichen] stopped at the highest point of the city wall, [Zhou Yuwen] stopped a few steps behind him, then turned around and didn't look at him again.
0:43:18|0:43:23|[Zhang Zhichen] immediately turned around and embraced [Zhou Yuwen] upon hearing these words.
0:43:23|0:43:26|[Zhou Yuwen] hesitated for a moment, then leaned on [Zhang Zhichen]'s chest.
0:43:33|0:43:38|[Zhou Yuwen] gently opened [Zhang Zhichen]'s arms and walked towards [Lao Huang], who was holding a handkerchief.
0:43:41|0:43:45|She looked at [Zhang Zhichen] somewhat shyly and smiled.
0:43:52|0:43:58|[Zhang Zhichen] listened to her finish, then like a gust of wind, floated down the city wall and ran down the pebble path with big strides.
0:44:0|0:44:5|Ignoring the exquisite suit on his body, [Lao Huang] leaped up like a monkey.
0:44:5|0:44:14|His climbing posture was very skilled, and in no time he reached the handkerchief hanging on the branch. He hurriedly ran down the slope to show off the loot to [Zhou Yuwen].
0:44:16|0:44:19|[Zhou Yuwen] covered her mouth in shock and hurriedly ran away.
0:44:19|0:44:22|Zhang Zhichen put down the waving handkerchief without any mistake.
0:44:22|0:44:27|The date ended abruptly, as if nothing had ever happened.
0:44:27|0:44:31|On the attic rooftop, [Zhang Zhichen] was pondering while playing with the oranges in his hand.
0:44:31|0:44:35|The mind of a sixteen or seventeen-year-old girl can be very complicated and unpredictable.
0:44:35|0:44:39|In Dr. Dai's room, Zhang Zhichen is using a stethoscope to give her a check-up.
0:44:39|0:44:43|After treatment, [Dr. Dai]'s body has improved a lot.
0:46:8|0:46:15|She, alone in the room, was in tears, without a hint of a smile in front of others.
0:46:30|0:46:32|At this point, [Dai Liyan] sighed.
0:46:35|0:46:39|[Dai Liyan] lowered his head in silence, as if thinking of something, and spoke anxiously.
0:47:29|0:47:31|[Zhou Yuwen] sat on the chair, speaking eloquently.
0:47:31|0:47:38|At this point, she turned away as if feeling a bit sad, let out a sigh, and a few teardrops could be seen in her eyes.
0:47:38|0:47:38|[Zhou Yuwen] spoke in a flat tone, as if everything had nothing to do with her.
0:48:3|0:48:12|The heavy words were thrown at Zhang Zhichen one by one, and he walked silently to the side of the shelf, continuing to listen.
0:48:12|0:48:23|[Zhou Yuwen] paid no attention to [Zhang Zhichen] and continued speaking to himself. When [Zhou Yuwen] reached this point, the calm facade finally cracked a bit. He sighed, lowered his head in dismay, and then continued speaking.
0:48:39|0:48:45|Sunlight falls on the face of [Zhou Yuwen], her delicate features filled with sadness.
0:48:45|0:48:49|[Zhang Zhichen] hesitated for a long time before finally deciding not to approach [Zhou Yuwen] after arriving at Yuzi.
0:49:2|0:49:7|[Zhou Yuwen] struggled to maintain her composure, choking back tears as she continued speaking.
0:49:9|0:49:13|[Zhang Zhichen] slowly placed his hand on [Zhou Yuwen]'s hand.
0:49:17|0:49:21|[Zhou Yuwen] shed no tears, allowing the tears to flow freely.
0:50:1|0:50:15|He was speaking when Zhang Zhichen had already gently embraced him. But as he finished speaking, he quickly realized that the current actions with Zhang Zhichen were somewhat crossing the line. He promptly pushed Zhang Zhichen away, turned to the side, and no longer looked at him.
0:50:15|0:50:24|Early the next morning, [Zhou Yuwen] dressed in a simple cheongsam as usual, tied up her hair with a handkerchief, and walked down the street with a basket.
0:50:26|0:50:35|She left very early, the streets were empty with not a single person in sight, only the faint sound of birds chirping and the clacking of leather shoes on the stone pavement.
0:50:35|0:50:42|The once tall walls on both sides of the small road are no longer there, leaving only broken remnants.
0:50:42|0:50:46|In a lonely place, [Zhou Yuwen] quietly disappeared at the end of the path.
0:50:46|0:50:50|Contrary to the loneliness on the street, the courtyard of [Dai Liyan]'s house is lively.
0:50:50|0:50:54|Early in the morning, [Dai Xiu] dashed into the corridor and ran towards [Zhang Zhichen]'s room.
0:50:59|0:51:5|[Zhang Zhichen] heard [Dai Xiu]'s call but did not respond, instead he went to the utility room to seek peace and quiet.
0:51:5|0:51:17|[Zhang Zhichen] listened to the footsteps outside the door, [Dai Xiu] searched for his voice, pacing back and forth in the utility room. The anxious footsteps scattered on the ground announced the heaviness and boredom of the owner's mind.
0:51:17|0:51:22|He sat weakly on a low stool on the side, his tall figure showing helplessness.
0:51:26|0:51:31|[Dai Xiu] couldn't find her no matter what, and suddenly rushed out the door.
0:51:31|0:51:36|In the Dai family garden, [Dai Liyan] is holding a book under the sunlight, carefully studying it.
0:51:36|0:51:39|Her spirits have improved a lot compared to a few days ago.
0:51:39|0:51:43|[Zhang Zhichen] walked over from the front yard and greeted her.
0:52:21|0:52:25|[Dai Liyan] smiled and then walked along the path with his hands behind his back.
0:52:25|0:52:27|[Zhang Zhichen] hurriedly followed behind her.
0:52:37|0:52:41|[Zhang Zhichen] lowered his head in shame after hearing about the losses.
0:53:38|0:53:41|In school, [Zhang Zhichen] greets the classmates nearby.
0:54:46|0:54:53|Accompanied by the music, the once shy students no longer held back, inviting their desired dance partners to glide into the dance floor together.
0:55:19|0:55:38|Night is falling, [Zhou Yuwen] walks alone on the city wall with a basket in hand, silently wandering. The ancient collapsed city wall looks even more dilapidated at this moment. His cheongsam quietly sways in the evening breeze, but he pays no attention. He walks aimlessly on the overgrown path, without any specific destination in mind.
0:55:38|0:55:41|In the end, he stood by the lake, gazing into the distance.
0:55:41|0:55:58|In the dim night, [Zhang Zhichen] lay on the bed in the study of Dai's house, idly playing with miscellaneous items. Suddenly, there was a knock on the door, but he paid no attention to the visitor and continued to fiddle with the small trinket in his hand.
0:55:58|0:56:2|The person came in and saw that he was being ignored, so he pushed open the door by himself.
0:56:2|0:56:5|The unexpected guest turns out to be [Zhou Yuwen].
0:56:5|0:56:7|He walked into the study and remained silent after entering.
0:56:43|0:56:48|[Zhou Yuwen] is untying [Zhang Zhichen] and walks to the small table in the other corner of the room.
0:56:48|0:56:57|[Zhang Zhichen] didn't hurry to catch up, he took a step forward and pulled the lamp string before walking behind [Zhou Yuwen].
0:57:3|0:57:8|[Zhou Yuwen] shifted her body away, avoiding any contact with [Zhang Zhichen], as she slowly paced around the small room alone.
0:57:10|0:57:11|[Zhou Yuwen] shook her head.
0:57:39|0:57:41|In the darkness, the expression on the face could not be clearly seen.
0:57:48|0:57:52|[Zhang Zhichen] grabbed [Zhou Yuwen]'s arm and pulled it forcefully.
0:57:59|0:58:3|[Zhou Yuwen] finished speaking and looked meaningfully at [Zhang Zhichen].
0:58:3|0:58:8|[Zhang Zhichen] felt a bit uncomfortable under his gaze, so he turned his head away and stopped looking at him.
0:58:11|0:58:18|[Zhou Yuwen] walked up to [Zhang Zhichen] with a satisfied smile on her face, as if she had just won a battle, and said.
0:58:25|0:58:34|[Zhang Zhichen] was a bit nervous, reaching out to stop [Zhou Yuwen] from leaving, but [Zhou Yuwen] ignored his actions.
0:58:34|0:58:39|[Zhou Yuwen] opened the door and prepared to leave, but then leaned against half of the door frame and peeked into the room.
0:58:45|0:58:48|[Zhou Yuwen] jokingly left these words before leaving.
0:58:48|0:58:53|[Zhang Zhichen] leaned weakly against the table after he left, lost in thought for a long time.
0:58:53|0:58:57|[Dai Liyan] leaned against the couch in the room, waiting for [Zhou Yuwen] to bring the medicine.
0:59:3|0:59:6|[Zhou Yuwen] walked into the room carrying a tray of medicine.
0:59:6|0:59:9|[Dai Liyan] was slightly distracted when he heard his rejection.
0:59:15|0:59:18|[Zhou Yuwen] sat down slowly next to the agent.
0:59:28|0:59:32|Zhou Yuwen didn't answer half of the questions that were not asked.
0:59:32|0:59:36|He placed the cup in his hand on the small table.
0:59:39|0:59:43|[Zhou Yuwen] looked at Dai Liyan in confusion.
0:59:47|0:59:50|Dai Liyan changed his posture and closed the distance with [Zhou Yuwen].
0:59:53|0:59:58|[Zhou Yuwen] looked at the agent Yan beside her.
1:0:48|1:0:50|After Dai Liyan finished speaking, he looked at [Zhou Yuwen].
1:0:50|1:0:53|[Zhou Yuwen] nervously clasped her hands together.
1:0:55|1:0:59|Dai Liyan looked at Zhou Yuwen with some confusion.
1:1:7|1:1:11|[Zhou Yuwen] placed her hand on Dai Liyan's hand.
1:1:11|1:1:16|Dai Liyan nodded as he saw him persisting.
1:1:16|1:1:22|[Zhou Yuwen] saw him relax his grip and then put her hand down.
1:1:22|1:1:24|[Zhou Yuwen], after receiving the answer, prepared to leave.
1:1:31|1:1:38|Please, [Dai Liyan] grabbed the arm of [Zhou Yuwen], but she ignored his request, pushed away his arm, and stood up.
1:1:39|1:1:43|[Zhou Yuwen] didn't hesitate for long and left on her own.
1:1:43|1:1:49|Dai Liyan's gaze followed Zhou Yuwen's figure until she walked out of the door and disappeared into the night.
1:1:49|1:1:53|[Dai Liyan] sighed heavily and lowered his head, lost in thought.
1:1:55|1:1:59|At the break of dawn, Zhou Yuwen arrived early at the city wall.
1:1:59|1:2:3|He was still wearing that simple cheongsam, carrying a basket of vegetables.
1:2:3|1:2:8|Having waited for a long time, [Zhang Zhichen] saw him appear and hurriedly went up to greet him.
1:2:8|1:2:14|[Zhou Yuwen] had already anticipated half of it, ignored him, and walked forward as if no one else was there.
1:2:14|1:2:17|He placed the basket on the stone bricks and glanced at [Zhang Zhichen] behind him.
1:2:30|1:2:36|The spring breeze tousled Zhou Yuwen's hair, a smile on his face as he slowly walked towards the ancient tree by the road.
1:2:36|1:2:41|After stopping, she turned her head to look at the profound Zhang Zhichen.
1:3:33|1:3:37|Li Yan, have you ever thought about how young your sister is?
1:3:39|1:3:42|Upon hearing this, [Zhang Zhichen] looked somewhat bewildered.
1:3:42|1:3:45|It took a long time before he finally spoke with a smile.
1:3:48|1:3:51|[Zhou Yuwen] looked at [Zhang Zhichen] with a touch of sadness.
1:3:53|1:4:0|[Zhang Zhichen] finished his recollection, and [Zhou Yuwen] could no longer maintain the calm makeup on her face, looking around with a hint of loneliness.
1:4:6|1:4:9|[Zhou Yuwen] slowly approached [Zhang Zhichen].
1:4:18|1:4:26|Zhang Zhichen sighed and walked weakly to the edge of the wall, leaning somewhat helplessly against the stone wall.
1:4:50|1:5:3|Zhang Zhichen's words made the atmosphere somewhat heavy, and for a while no one spoke again. It was not until later that Zhou Yuwen finally spoke.
1:5:3|1:5:24|Zhang Zhichen turned around in frustration, sighed heavily, and Zhou Yuwen glanced at him. Seeing that Zhang Zhichen was ignoring her, she silently walked over to him. Zhang Zhichen noticed her approaching, moved aside without looking at Zhou Yuwen, who didn't mind his actions and just silently lingered on the path.
1:5:38|1:5:41|At night, everyone is celebrating Little Sister's birthday.
1:8:40|1:8:42|[Zhou Yuwen] picked up the wine glass and drank it all in one gulp.
1:9:29|1:9:42|Xiao Mei took the wine glass, took a sip, looked at his wife on behalf of [Dai Liyan], and said, the two of them picked up the wine glasses and drank them all.
1:9:47|1:9:57|[Zhou Yuwen] quickly helped [Dai Liyan] calm down, then picked up the wine glass and refilled it.
1:10:0|1:10:3|[Zhou Yuwen] picked up the wine glass and walked towards Zhang Zhichen.
1:10:32|1:10:36|When Zhang Zhichen was drinking, Dai Liyan's expression was somewhat displeased.
1:10:50|1:10:53|[Zhou Yuwen] took the wine jug and poured wine for Zhang Zhichen personally.
1:10:53|1:10:56|Dai Liyan stood up and left the table.
1:11:25|1:11:30|In the flickering candlelight, [Zhou Yuwen] and [Zhang Zhichen] drank cup after cup, with [Zhang Zhichen] boldly finishing his drink in one gulp.
1:11:37|1:11:43|The two raised their glasses joyfully.
1:11:43|1:11:50|While everyone was playing dice and drinking in the room, [Zhang Zhichen], [Dai Xiu] quietly walked alone into the backyard garden.
1:11:52|1:12:1|The night was dark and heavy, like thick ink hanging in the sky, seemingly echoing the loneliness of [Dai Liyan], with only a few stars scattered sparsely.
1:12:1|1:12:7|In the moonlight, he slowly wandered on the path, his steps extremely slow, leisurely wandering in the night.
1:12:7|1:12:16|At this point, it had been night for a long time. Relying solely on the moonlight, they couldn't see the road clearly. However, Dai Liyan did not bring a lantern, and instead groped his way forward slowly.
1:12:18|1:12:26|The garden was not large, [Dai Xiu] walked along the corridor to the side of the rockery, leaning weakly against it to catch her breath.
1:12:26|1:12:28|In the moonlight, taking advantage of her lonely figure.
1:12:31|1:12:36|After a while, she slowly turned around, swaying her steps, and silently walked back the way she came.
1:12:36|1:12:45|But Li Yan's expression was somewhat absent-minded. Clearly, her condition had improved under the care of [Zhang Zhichen], but now it seemed to have worsened.
1:12:45|1:12:50|The hunched body and slow pace of Zhou Yuwen made her look like a dying old person.
1:12:52|1:13:4|He quietly walked along the small path to the corner of the garden where the old tree stood, running his fingers gently over the patterns on the trunk. With a somewhat melancholic look, he gazed at the front yard, his eyes filled with sorrow and pain.
1:13:4|1:13:12|He raised his hand to hold the treetop, tightly embracing the branches in front of him as if they could give him warmth.
1:13:12|1:13:16|He tightly embraced the old tree, finally unable to help but sob helplessly.
1:14:5|1:14:10|[Dai Liyan] vented his helplessness and hardship alone like a child.
1:14:10|1:14:15|He sobbed softly, the usual facade of magnanimity and calm finally crumbling at this moment.
1:14:15|1:14:18|In a deserted corner, he murmured his pain softly.
1:14:20|1:14:25|In the front yard, the drunken [Zhang Zhichen] started singing a lovely song, "A Rose".
1:15:34|1:15:38|[Zhang Zhichen] sang until he was a little tired, leaning against the wooden door and dozing off.
1:15:38|1:15:46|[Zhou Yuwen] and [Dai Xiu] are preparing to leave with lanterns.
1:16:34|1:16:36|But [Dai Xiu] looked at [Zhou Yuwen], and then glanced at [Zhang Zhichen].
1:17:17|1:17:29|[Dai Xiu] pulled [Zhou Yuwen] out of the pocket, leaving only [Zhang Zhichen] to sing the song for the longest time. He leaned against the door panel and sang with tears in his eyes.
1:17:29|1:17:35|Finally, [Zhang Zhichen] couldn't hold on any longer, his body slowly sliding down the door panel.
1:17:58|1:18:3|[Zhou Yuwen] is lying on the bed in the room, poking the fire softly.
1:18:3|1:18:6|He turned over, lying face up on the bed, unable to stop gasping.
1:18:6|1:18:17|Tears fell silently, arms hanging weakly by the side, resembling a butterfly with broken wings, as if the person who was about to drink and gamble with [Zhang Zhichen] in the previous story was not him at all.
1:18:19|1:18:27|Suddenly, he seemed to have remembered something, and with great difficulty, he propped himself up with his arms and weakly walked towards the dressing table not far away.
1:18:27|1:18:35|He took small steps towards the half-height mirror, looking at himself in the mirror, [Zhou Yuwen] constantly touching his own face.
1:18:35|1:18:38|Seeing the tears on his face, he wiped them away resolutely.
1:18:40|1:18:47|[Zhou Yuwen] looked around at the surroundings, picked up the bronze hand mirror beside her, and meticulously illuminated her own face inch by inch.
1:18:47|1:18:53|He held the mirror with a silly smile, then chuckled lightly, suddenly put down the mirror, and walked back.
1:18:53|1:19:0|He suddenly opened the wardrobe, as if he had made a firm decision, like a king, inspecting the belongings in his wardrobe.
1:19:1|1:19:7|[Dai Liyan], who had just returned from the backyard, met [Zhou Yuwen], who had changed into a new outfit, as he walked onto the carved corridor.
1:19:7|1:19:11|There are traces of tears on [Zhou Yuwen]'s face.
1:19:11|1:19:16|She saw [Dai Liyan] approaching, who didn't speak or look at her, but stared straight ahead.
1:19:16|1:19:25|[Dai Liyan] broke the somewhat awkward atmosphere. [Zhou Yuwen] did not respond. He took a deep breath and slowly released the handkerchief he was clutching.
1:19:25|1:19:33|The moonlight shines on him, making him look like a lifeless jade beauty, cold and inscrutable.
1:19:33|1:19:39|[Dai Liyan] saw his reaction and, somewhat helplessly, walked away with his hands behind his back, hunching his body.
1:19:39|1:19:44|[Zhou Yuwen] saw his figure disappear at the end of the corridor, and then immediately walked towards the direction of the study.
1:19:51|1:20:1|Under the cover of night, the entire courtyard was quiet, with only the sound of Zhou Yuwen's footsteps echoing on the stone bricks, slowly fading away into the peaceful night.
1:20:1|1:20:9|[Zhang Zhichen] was in the room, wiping his face with water. He was now very awake, as if the person who just sang love songs to [Zhou Yuwen] was not him.
1:20:46|1:20:56|[Zhou Yuwen] finished speaking, pushed [Zhang Zhichen] who was blocking the door, stubbornly entered his room, and stood in front of the desk inside the room.
1:20:56|1:21:1|[Zhang Zhichen] saw that he was a bit stubborn, so he sat on the bed helplessly, rubbing his hair in frustration.
1:21:4|1:21:10|[Zhou Yuwen] suddenly had a hint of a smile on her face, but the smile was icy and did not reach her eyes.
1:21:10|1:21:16|He turned his head to look at [Zhang Zhichen], then suddenly twisted his slender waist and walked towards him.
1:21:16|1:21:22|[Zhou Yuwen] slowly approached [Zhang Zhichen], sat down beside him, and buried her face slowly into [Zhang Zhichen]'s shoulder.
1:21:23|1:21:33|[Zhang Zhichen] did not refuse at first, but a few seconds later, he couldn't bear the condemnation of his conscience. He pushed [Zhou Yuwen] away and hurriedly ran towards the desk as if fleeing.
1:21:33|1:21:40|[Zhou Yuwen] did not get angry after being pushed away. He walked slowly towards [Zhang Zhichen] and stood by his side without saying a word.
1:21:44|1:21:49|[Zhou Yuwen] suddenly grabbed [Zhang Zhichen] by the collar, staring at him fiercely.
1:21:49|1:21:54|Zhang Zhichen was a little flustered by his sudden move, but immediately reacted.
1:21:54|1:21:57|Zhang Zhichen suddenly picked up Zhou Yuwen around the waist and walked towards the bed.
1:21:58|1:22:4|In the growing candlelight inside the room, the hurried movements of the two appeared so clumsy.
1:22:4|1:22:8|Suddenly, Zhang Zhichen paused and stopped to look at the face of [Zhou Yuwen].
1:22:8|1:22:12|Li Zhi suddenly came to his senses and slowly put down the person in his arms.
1:22:12|1:22:17|He ran out suddenly, locked the door with a bolt, isolating [Zhou Yuwen] from himself.
1:22:17|1:22:24|[Zhou Yuwen], trapped in the house, felt a bit at a loss. He wanted to get closer to [Zhang Zhichen], but Zhang Zhichen was hesitant to indulge him.
1:22:25|1:22:29|[Zhou Yuwen] helplessly knocked on the glass of the carved door.
1:22:29|1:22:35|Zhang Zhichen ignored him and silently walked to the other side, burying his head weakly in the corner of the wall.
1:22:35|1:22:44|[Zhou Yuwen] increased the intensity of knocking on the glass. Seeing that Zhang Zhichen ignored him, [Zhou Yuwen] suddenly raised his hand and shattered the glass, then decisively took the door lock and entered the room.
1:22:44|1:22:48|The sound of glass shattering is even louder in the quiet night.
1:22:48|1:22:55|Dai Liyan was ready to go to sleep. He heard a sound by the bed and remained silent for a long time before slowly blowing out the candle by the bed.
1:22:56|1:23:3|Dai Liyan couldn't sleep soundly, constantly adjusting her sleeping position, looking restless and burdened with worries.
1:23:3|1:23:9|In the study, [Zhang Zhichen] saw [Zhou Yuwen] prying open the lock on the glass door, hurriedly entered, and checked her injuries.
1:23:9|1:23:20|[Zhang Zhichen] half knelt beside her, gently picked up [Zhou Yuwen]'s soft hoof, buried his face in her hand back, they were as quiet as the night at this moment, no one wanted to break the peace of this moment.
1:23:20|1:23:24|[Zhou Yuwen] ignored him, took her hand back inch by inch, and walked out of the study.
1:23:25|1:23:33|After Zhou Yuwen left, Zhang Zhichen sat dejectedly on the floor, with an infinite sense of regret, the candlelight shining on his peaceful face.
1:23:33|1:23:40|In his usually well-tailored suit, now wrinkled and draped on him, he didn't care about it at the moment.
1:23:40|1:23:47|[Zhou Yuwen] has returned to the room. Sitting alone in front of the dressing table, he lights a candle. After bandaging his wounds, [Zhou Yuwen] spends a long time in front of the vanity.
1:24:10|1:24:16|He slowly got up, walked around the shelf with a vase, and reached out to turn off the lights in the room.
1:24:16|1:24:26|Inside the room, enveloped by the night, [Zhou Yuwen] did not immediately push the door open. He leaned quietly against the door frame, his body rising and falling with rapid breaths.
1:24:27|1:24:31|He carefully examined the furnishings in the room, not willing to miss a single detail.
1:24:31|1:24:36|[Zhang Zhichen] sat on the floor in the study, lost in thought.
1:24:36|1:24:40|At this moment, he no longer looks as spirited as before.
1:24:40|1:24:48|His expression was dull, his face filled with melancholy and despair, looking completely different from his previous confident self.
1:24:48|1:24:52|His hands lay weakly between his spread legs, looking extremely decadent.
1:24:53|1:25:1|The room fell silent again. [Zhou Yuwen] walked to the door, but then hesitated, leaning against it, unsure whether to go out or not.
1:25:1|1:25:7|After taking a deep breath, [Zhou Yuwen] still stood in front of the door in silence.
1:25:7|1:25:14|In [Dai Liyan]'s room, he had already laid down and the quiet room was suddenly interrupted by a series of urgent knocks on the door.
1:25:14|1:25:18|[Dai Liyan] did not get up, but looked up with a puzzled expression and asked towards the door.
1:25:26|1:25:32|Zhang Zhichen gently pushed the door open and entered the room.
1:25:41|1:25:49|In the dimly lit room, Zhang Zhichen, guided by the moonlight filtering in, fumbled his way to the table, bent down and slowly searched for medicine in the drawer.
1:25:49|1:25:53|He found it quite easily and soon picked up a medicine bottle, pouring out a few pills into his hand.
1:26:5|1:26:12|When Zhang Zhichen hurried to the door, he looked back at Dai Liyan with some concern, opened his mouth as if to say something, but in the end, he left without a word.
1:26:29|1:26:35|Dai Liyan saw him leave and was about to go to sleep. Footsteps were heard outside the door again, and the person did not knock but pushed the door open with a bamboo stick.
1:26:35|1:26:37|Upon hearing the voice of [Zhou Yuwen], Dai Liyan suddenly sat up and turned on the desk lamp, looking at him with a puzzled expression.
1:27:21|1:27:26|[Zhou Yuwen] sat slowly on the edge of the bed, but her gaze never met Dai Liyan's.
1:27:26|1:27:34|Dai Liyan, as if not noticing her evasion, leaned her arm on the small table at the head of the bed and slowly said to Zhou Yuwen.
1:28:22|1:28:25|[Zhou Yuwen] heard this and silently lowered her head.
1:28:25|1:28:28|Dai Liyan continued to speak.
1:28:30|1:28:33|At this point, Dai Liyan seemed a bit lost in thought.
1:28:38|1:28:42|[Zhou Yuwen] looked up in surprise, but still did not meet [Dai Liyan]'s gaze.
1:28:46|1:28:50|[Zhou Yuwen] was a bit absent-minded, shaking his head gently in denial.
1:28:50|1:28:54|[Dai Li] gently took his hand when she saw his reaction.
1:28:55|1:29:0|[Zhou Yuwen] said nothing, but used his hand to pull [Dai Li] away from him.
1:29:0|1:29:3|Dai Liyan finally saw the wound on his hand clearly.
1:29:13|1:29:19|[Zhou Yuwen] wanted to speak up and refuse, but before he could say a word, [Dai Liyan] had already hurriedly stood up.
1:29:19|1:29:25|[Zhou Yuwen] saw his reaction and turned away, ignoring his anxious search for medicine.
1:29:25|1:29:36|[Dai Liyan] skillfully came to the cabinet, opened the drawer, found the white medicine, took it and quickly came to the bedside, pulled [Zhou Yuwen]'s hand, carefully removed the previously improperly bandaged wound.
1:29:42|1:29:48|[Dai Liyan] carefully unwrapped the bandages as if holding a precious treasure, afraid that [Zhou Yuwen] would be hurt again.
1:29:54|1:30:2|Dai Liyan furrowed his brows, tenderly helping Zhou Yuwen apply medicine. Zhou Yuwen couldn't stop choking back tears because of his actions, and his eyes gradually became moist.
1:30:2|1:30:8|Dai Liyan saw him crying, gently blew on his wound, and held the cotton swab in his hand with a gentle touch.
1:30:8|1:30:13|[Zhou Yuwen] sat down slowly beside him, tears streaming down her face as she watched Dai Liyan's gentle movements.
1:30:14|1:30:33|At this moment, the two of them forgot everything that had happened before, just like an ordinary couple. Dai Liyan carefully applied ointment to [Zhou Yuwen], and [Zhou Yuwen] gradually calmed down because of his gentle actions. The early morning light illuminated the Dai family's courtyard. Dai Liyan held a book, accompanied by the chirping of birds, sitting in a daze in the pavilion in the garden.
1:30:33|1:30:41|Zhang Zhichen walked along the corridor and saw Dai Liyan. He didn't speak, but leaned against the railing and stared blankly at the ground.
1:31:22|1:31:28|Zhang Zhichen turned his head with a guilty look, his gaze somewhat uneasy, no longer meeting the eyes of the agent.
1:31:36|1:31:43|Dai Liyan's expression was somewhat strange. He avoided Zhang Zhichen's charming gaze and awkwardly changed the subject.
1:31:55|1:31:59|Zhang Zhichen lost in thought, staring at Dai Liyan, and remained silent for a long time.
1:31:59|1:32:6|By the city wall, [Zhou Yuwen] walked silently along the desolate path outside the river in early spring, carrying a basket.
1:32:6|1:32:10|In the distance, the rice fields that can be vaguely seen still exude a hint of vitality.
1:32:10|1:32:16|[Zhou Yuwen] stood by the river, gazing into the distance. The cold morning wind wrapped around his slender body, making him appear so cold.
1:32:17|1:32:21|He stood silently, no one knew what he was looking at, what he was thinking. 
1:32:21|1:32:32|The gentle breeze ruffled his skirt, but he paid no attention. Rather than walking, he seemed to be wandering, like a helpless duckweed, quietly drifting above the small town.
1:32:44|1:32:51|In the courtyard, [Dai Liyan] appeared in [Zhou Yuwen]'s room, contrary to his usual behavior.
1:32:51|1:32:56|She lowered her head and walked through the carved wooden door of the outer room, slowly making her way to the inner room.
1:32:56|1:33:17|The half-height round mirror on the dressing table reflected her figure. After looking around, she finally sat in front of the dressing table. The room of [Zhou Yuwen] was decorated very elegantly, with flourishing orchids on the shelf and a delicate teapot on the small table, all showing the owner's elegance and knowledge.
1:33:17|1:33:22|[Dai Liyan] observed the surroundings, lowering his head to look at the cosmetics placed on the dressing table.
1:33:23|1:33:32|Suddenly reaching out and picking up the snow cream with a portrait of a beauty on it, she skillfully unscrewed the lid, put it to her nose and sniffed, the strong fragrance made her cough uncontrollably.
1:33:32|1:33:40|She had to tighten the snowflake ointment and put it back in place, then slowly got up after taking a look around the room, walking through the tall screen to the inner room.
1:33:41|1:33:45|The room was not large, with nothing but a bed inside.
1:33:45|1:33:51|The agent sat by the bed, carefully examining them as if trying to etch them deeply into his mind.
1:33:51|1:34:1|By the bedside, the thin gauze curtains were fluttering in the wind. Dai Liyan gazed at the dancing gauze for a while before slowly getting up and leaving through the back door of the factory.
1:34:2|1:34:10|He walked slowly along the corridor, his arms straight down by his side, his eyes staring blankly at the road, looking absent-minded.
1:34:10|1:34:18|The sunlight fell on him, not adding any vitality to his figure, but instead highlighting his loneliness and lack of joy.
1:34:19|1:34:24|He slowly moved his feet until his figure gradually disappeared at the end of the carved corridor.
1:34:24|1:34:27|The scene cuts to Dai Liyan back in his own room.
1:34:27|1:34:32|He walked to the cabinet and reached into the second drawer, searching for something.
1:34:32|1:34:35|When he turned around again, he was already holding a small vial in his hand.
1:34:36|1:34:51|His movements were extremely slow, like an old man who had weathered many storms, slowly walking to the small table by the bed. He raised his hand to pour himself a glass of water, then slowly approached the bed, sitting down slowly with the help of the table, and opened the medicine bottle after sitting down.
1:34:52|1:35:1|The flower poured out a pill, not bothering to count how many pills were in her hand at the moment. Perhaps she herself didn't know how many she needed to take.
1:35:1|1:35:11|She held the pill in her hand without any hurry, first carefully surveying the old and quaint little house, then looking up at the ceiling in a leisurely manner.
1:35:11|1:35:18|After doing all this, she suddenly put the pill into her mouth, took the water on the small table, drank a big mouthful, and then put down the water glass.
1:35:20|1:35:27|After all this, he slumped his shoulders heavily as if he had no strength left in his body.
1:35:27|1:35:31|He sat motionless on the bed like a clay sculpture for a long time.
1:35:35|1:35:40|After an unknown period of time, she slowly reached out and lowered the raised bed curtain.
1:35:40|1:35:49|The bed curtain fell apart as Dai Liyan moved, allowing the sunlight to shine through the window into the room, only to be blocked back by the scattered curtain.
1:35:49|1:35:58|She gazed blankly at the untied curtain, slowly stood up from the bed, moved to another corner where the curtain was still tied, and gently untied it.
1:35:58|1:36:4|As the curtain was slowly pulled back, there was no hope of even a glimmer of light in the airtight bed.
1:36:6|1:36:12|[Dai Liyan] didn't care. She slowly drew back the curtain and rushed towards the desperate world she had created with her own hands, without hesitation.
1:36:15|1:36:26|Outside the Dai family's courtyard, the sun was already high in the sky, but there was not a soul in the small town, only the silent scene of crumbling walls and ruins, silently announcing the loneliness and decay of the city.
1:36:26|1:36:33|[Zhou Yuwen] appeared on the street with a basket in hand, but did not bring much vitality to this lonely alley.
1:36:33|1:36:40|The desolate wind tousled his hairline, and he leisurely took his steps, disappearing into the old courtyard of Dai Liyan's house.
1:36:42|1:36:47|In the courtyard at home, [Lao Huang] carried a wooden tray and walked along the carved corridor towards the agent's room.
1:36:47|1:36:52|He crossed the high threshold between the outer and inner rooms with ease and familiarity.
1:36:52|1:36:56|The room was empty, with no sign of Dai Liyan.
1:36:56|1:37:0|[Lao Huang] looked around in confusion, but didn't see anything unusual.
1:37:0|1:37:6|He slowly placed the tray in his hand on the small table, and smiled lightly at the bed surrounded by curtains.
1:37:13|1:37:15|Seeing no response, [Lao Huang] pulled back the bed curtain.
1:37:20|1:37:25|[Lao Huang] leaned half of his body into the bed and called out loudly for the agent.
1:37:28|1:37:31|[Lao Huang] realized that something was wrong and ran outside in a panic.
1:38:6|1:38:12|[Zhou Yuwen] quickly pulled back the bed curtain and sat on the bed, leaning forward to observe the situation of the agent.
1:38:12|1:38:16|Suddenly, he saw a bottle of sleeping pills on the small table next to the agent's bed.
1:38:18|1:38:25|He reached out and took the medicine bottle, clutching it tightly in his hand, then continued to look at [Dai Liyan], afraid of missing any of his reactions.
1:38:25|1:38:28|The agent still slept heavily.
1:38:28|1:38:32|[Zhou Yuwen] finally couldn't control her emotions, tears fell from her eyes.
1:38:32|1:38:37|[Zhang Zhichen] strode over the high threshold like the wind and rushed into a room.
1:38:37|1:38:41|[Zhou Yuwen] saw him coming and quickly got up to hand him the bottle of sleeping pills in her hand.
1:38:42|1:38:47|[Zhang Zhichen] took the medicine bottle, glanced down at it, and then hurried towards Dai Liyan lying on the bed.
1:38:47|1:38:55|[Zhang Zhichen] felt Dai Liyan's pulse, then reached out to touch his artery, carefully examining Dai Liyan's physical condition at the moment.
1:38:55|1:38:59|He turned on the bedside lamp to conduct a more thorough inspection.
1:39:6|1:39:8|Zhang Zhichen opened Dai Liyan's eyelids and observed.
1:39:11|1:39:14|They together placed the agent flat on Zhang Zhichen's legs.
1:39:14|1:39:18|Zhang Zhichen clapped the agent's back with both hands pressed together.
1:39:22|1:39:26|[Zhou Yuwen] quickly turned around and took a pair of rubber gloves from Zhang Zhichen's suitcase.
1:39:26|1:39:31|After getting it, he handed it over non-stop to Zhang Zhichen, who was helping the agent induce vomiting.
1:39:40|1:39:45|Zhang Zhichen hesitated for a moment.
1:39:45|1:39:55|With Zhang Zhichen's rescue efforts, Dai Liyan spat out some sleeping pills. He continued to vigorously pat Dai Liyan's back, but Dai Liyan didn't spit out anything else.
1:39:55|1:40:2|[Zhou Yuwen] quickly took out a handkerchief, carefully wiped the agent, and then the two of them together laid the agent back on the bed.
1:40:2|1:40:7|Compared to Zhou Yuwen's anxiousness, Doctor Zhang Zhichen's calm demeanor is evident at this moment.
1:40:8|1:40:14|After helping Dai Liyan back to bed, he took off the rubber gloves and calmly started to tidy up the first aid kit.
1:40:14|1:40:23|[Zhou Yuwen] looked a bit flustered, constantly pacing by the agent's bed, twisting the handkerchief in his hand into a ball, never stopping his sighing movements.
1:40:23|1:40:34|He bent down sitting beside Dai Liyan, his fingers tangled together constantly spinning, sometimes feeling Dai Liyan's pulse, sometimes reaching out to touch Dai Liyan's cheek, appearing anxious and helpless.
1:40:37|1:40:42|In the silence between them, the sound of footsteps suddenly came from outside the door.
1:40:42|1:40:45|It turns out that [Lao Huang] brought the little sister from school back.
1:40:45|1:40:46|Dai Xiu burst into the room like a gust of wind.
1:41:6|1:41:9|[Zhang Zhichen] walks towards Xiaomei.
1:41:17|1:41:20|Zhou Yuwen looked helplessly at [Zhang Zhichen].
1:41:28|1:41:31|[Zhang Zhichen] walked away dejectedly, while the two younger sisters continued to cry and shout.
1:41:40|1:41:50|It's already night, but the courtyard is not as quiet as usual. The lights are still on, and the whole family is gathered in the room of [Dai Liyan], unable to close their eyes.
1:41:50|1:42:1|The agent was still not awake, and Dai Xiaomei was a little tired, half-leaning in front of the bed but forcing herself not to sleep. [Zhang Zhichen] sat at the table rubbing the dust off the sun, his exquisite suit all wrinkled.
1:42:1|1:42:9|[Zhou Yuwen] sat at the foot of the bed, staring fixedly at the agent, not wanting to miss any of his reactions, and no one spoke to break the tense atmosphere.
1:42:9|1:42:15|The thoughts of everyone fluctuated with the agent, and the room maintained an eerie calm.
1:42:15|1:42:21|[Lao Huang] walked in from outside with a hot towel, shook his head, and slowly approached [Zhou Yuwen], whispering softly.
1:42:25|1:42:35|[Zhou Yuwen] heard the sound but didn't turn her head. She raised her hand and pushed aside the tray handed over by [Lao Huang], staring at Dai Liyan in a trance, not even glancing at [Lao Huang].
1:42:35|1:42:39|Dai Xiaomei stared blankly at her brother with closed eyes, and [Lao Huang] had to leave.
1:42:42|1:42:50|[Zhang Zhichen] was brought back to reality by the voice of [Lao Huang]. He took the hot towel handed to him by [Lao Huang], casually wiped his hands, and then passed the towel back to [Lao Huang].
1:42:50|1:43:5|At this moment, the originally quiet agent made a move, surprising Dai Xiaomei who raised her arm in astonishment. Zhou Yuwen quickly leaned over, and Dai Xiaomei exclaimed in surprise at the agent.
1:43:5|1:43:19|Three people gathered around the agent's bed, as the agent slowly woke up and turned his head to look at them. [Zhou Yuwen] and [Zhang Zhichen] locked eyes, and [Zhang Zhichen] nodded at her.
1:43:19|1:43:22|Dai Liyan turned his head and slowly looked towards Zhou Yuwen at the foot of the bed.
1:43:29|1:43:34|Dai Liyan closed her eyes and slowly nodded.
1:43:34|1:43:39|[Zhou Yuwen] held [Dai Liyan]'s hand, leaning helplessly against the bed, unable to hold back her tears.
1:43:44|1:43:48|Her emotions finally erupted, crying as she leaned towards [Dai Liyan].
1:43:55|1:44:3|Dai Liyan's voice gradually softened as he looked down at Zhou Yuwen leaning against his chest, reaching out to gently stroke Zhou Yuwen's embroidered hair.
1:44:3|1:44:7|Dai Xiaomei saw her brother wake up, and her nervous expression gradually relaxed.
1:44:9|1:44:19|A new day begins, outside the gate of the Dai family courtyard, [Lao Huang] skillfully steps out and pours the dregs from the medicine pot onto the small path outside the gate, then slowly walks back into the courtyard with the empty pot, and closes the gate again.
1:44:19|1:44:20|In the room, [Zhou Yuwen] is helping Dai Xiaomei, who is dressed in new clothes, to carefully dress up.
1:44:20|1:44:20|[Zhou Yuwen] paused her movements.
1:44:41|1:44:50|Dai Xiaomei's face showed no sign of joy.
1:44:50|1:44:56|Dai Xiaomei looked up and glanced at Zhou Yuwen in the mirror.
1:44:56|1:44:59|[Zhou Yuwen] was taken aback by her refusal, her hands paused momentarily.
1:44:59|1:45:2|Dai Xiaomei pondered for a while, then turned around and took Zhou Yuwen's hand.
1:45:11|1:45:19|Upon hearing Dai Xiaomei's straightforward question, [Zhou Yuwen] hesitated for a moment, then turned her around and gently guided her back to the dressing table to sit down.
1:45:19|1:45:26|Both of them had subtle expressions, with Dai Xiaomei realizing she had said the wrong thing. She opened her mouth but did not explain.
1:45:26|1:45:31|[Zhou Yuwen] sighed and didn't even look at her, carefully combing Dai Xiaomei's short hair with a comb.
1:45:33|1:45:40|The two of them fell silent for a long time after Dai Xiaomei's slip of the tongue just now. Dai Xiaomei stared straight at the mirror where [Zhou Yuwen] was combing her hair for her.
1:45:40|1:45:49|[Zhou Yuwen]'s expression became increasingly sorrowful. Finally, unable to contain her melancholy, she hurriedly turned and ran towards the table corner near the door.
1:45:53|1:46:0|Tears finally fell, Dai Xiaomei looked at Zhou Yuwen crying in the corner, feeling a bit guilty as she lowered her head.
1:46:0|1:46:8|At the city gate, Dai Xiaomei, who is already dressed up, is sending medicine back to Shanghai with Lao Huang and Zhang Zhichen.
1:46:8|1:46:15|As they reached the city gate, [Zhang Zhichen] reached out and stopped him, wanting to continue escorting his younger sister Dai Xiu forward.
1:46:25|1:46:29|Dai Liyan and Dai Xiu smiled and walked slowly towards the outskirts of the city.
1:46:32|1:46:36|The three of them walked leisurely, with Zhou Yuwen lost in thought.
1:46:41|1:46:47|Zhang Zhichen half embraced Dai Liyan's shoulder, Lao Huang carried the suitcase, slowly following behind them.
1:46:47|1:46:51|The three of them continued talking and slowly walked towards the door of the car.
1:46:51|1:46:55|In the Dai family courtyard, [Dai Xiu] was struggling to trim the saplings while looking up.
1:46:55|1:46:58|[Zhang Zhichen] came down from the second floor, and [Dai Xiu] greeted him.
1:46:59|1:47:4|[Dai Xiu] paused and waited for [Zhang Zhichen] to walk down the stairs and stand beside him.
1:47:4|1:47:6|He paused for a moment before continuing.
1:47:12|1:47:14|He put down the wrongly cut branches and continued speaking.
1:47:26|1:47:33|[Zhou Yuwen] did not answer [Dai Xiu], just raised her head and silently watched her trimming actions, seeing her sweating a little.
1:47:33|1:47:42|[Zhou Yuwen] took out a handkerchief from her side and handed it to [Dai Liyan]. [Dai Liyan] took the handkerchief, wiped the sweat on his forehead, and then handed it back to him.
1:47:42|1:47:46|[Zhou Yuwen] took the handkerchief, turned around and prepared to leave, reminding Dai Liyan.
1:47:55|1:48:0|Dai Liyan, after listening to Zhou Yuwen's instructions, looked somewhat excited and continued to trim the nearby saplings.
1:48:3|1:48:7|[Zhou Yuwen] turned and walked up the corridor, heading up to the attic along the stairs.
1:48:7|1:48:14|[Zhou Yuwen] sat down on the bench by the attic window and began embroidering with the embroidery frame from the basket.
1:48:14|1:48:21|The slender silver needle shuttles in his hand on the silk cloth, and the embroidery in his hand slowly takes shape, perhaps a little tired. 
1:48:21|1:48:26|He leaned back in his chair for a rest, then continued to lower his head and embroider flowers.
1:48:26|1:48:28|Suddenly, the sound of the train whistle broke the deadlock.
1:48:34|1:48:42|[Zhou Yuwen] slowly raised her head with the sound of the whistle, her gaze somewhat absent-minded, casually looking ahead without any sense of surprise or excitement.
1:48:42|1:48:48|She only paused for a moment, then came to her senses and continued to embroider attentively in the lingering light of the spring sunset.
1:48:48|1:48:56|In the garden, Zhou Yuwen heard the sound of a train whistle, sighed faintly, raised her hand to trim a branch, and then had no further reaction.
1:49:0|1:49:5|The sound of the train running came closer from a distance, and then gradually faded away.
1:49:5|1:49:17|With the train roaring away, the small town fell back into silence. [Zhou Yuwen] still sat by the window in the attic embroidering, everything became quiet again, as if nothing had ever happened.
1:49:17|1:49:25|Outside the small town, the city walls are still covered with thatch, even though it is already spring, there is no sign of spring at all.
1:49:25|1:49:31|Spring may have never arrived, or perhaps it has already come and quietly left.
