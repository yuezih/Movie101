0:0:44|0:0:47|[Qi Jia] boarded a bus with a vacant look in her eyes.
0:0:47|0:0:51|A little girl saw him willing to stand up.
0:0:51|0:0:54|[Qi Jia] glanced at the girl.
0:0:54|0:1:1|[Qi Jia] looked around and confirmed that the "auntie" mentioned by the girl was herself.
0:1:1|0:1:4|[Qi Jia] firmly grasped the girl's face.
0:1:4|0:1:10|She ambitiously shook the girl's cheeks back and forth, unceremoniously taking the seat the girl had vacated.
0:1:11|0:1:16|Several passengers in front turned their heads angrily and glared at him.
0:1:16|0:1:20|[Qi Jia] looked back, and everyone in the car cast accusing glances at her.
0:1:23|0:1:29|The onlookers' eyes were relentless, but [Qi Jia] couldn't be bothered to pay attention to them, so she turned her head and looked out the window.
0:1:29|0:1:32|A lush greenery passed by, tears gradually welled up in his eyes.
0:1:45|0:1:50|In Qi Jia's eyes, a graceful figure in a wedding dress is reflected.
0:1:50|0:1:52|The time goes back to 2009.
0:1:54|0:2:1|[Qi Jia] is wearing a wedding dress, with ribbon high heels on her feet, running desperately under the shade of trees on the university campus.
0:2:1|0:2:5|She ran out of breath, attracting the attention of her classmates along the way.
0:2:7|0:2:16|[Qi Jia] pushed open the doors of the auditorium, with a carpet leading all the way to the colorful stage. The graduates in academic gowns sat packed on both sides of the auditorium.
0:2:16|0:2:25|He walked into the auditorium, with Lin Shuer helping him lift the trailing wedding dress. [Qi Jia] mischievously looked up and smiled amidst the cheers, pointing at the classmates beside the aisle.
0:2:29|0:2:41|He walked to the front row, waved to everyone, and walked with Lin Shuer to a handsome and gentle-looking boy, who asked quietly.
0:2:58|0:3:4|Liu Chong beside [Qi Jia], slowly stood up with the manuscript in hand and walked to the platform, bowing deeply to everyone.
0:3:4|0:3:9|Qi Jia kept her eyes fixed on her, clapping and smiling.
0:3:25|0:3:33|Liu Chong finished his passionate speech and was about to step down from the stage when [Qi Jia] suddenly stood up and walked towards him.
0:3:33|0:3:37|[Qi Jia] looked at everyone with a smile, then turned to Liu Chong.
0:3:37|0:3:41|The principal on stage gestured for everyone to be quiet, standing in front of the microphone and speaking.
0:3:54|0:3:59|[Qi Jia] lifted her skirt, ran to Liu Chong's side, took his arm, and pulled him in front of the principal.
0:4:16|0:4:20|Li Teng boiled over again, [Qi Jia] turned towards him, holding Liu Chong's arm.
0:4:45|0:4:53|Liu Chong was extremely embarrassed, with classmates focusing intently on the stage, [Lin Shuer] even clasping her hands in front of her chest.
0:4:55|0:5:1|Liu Chong pushed away [Qi Jia]'s hand, and her eyes instantly lost focus, her mind going blank.
0:5:7|0:5:9|And at the next moment, something unexpected happened.
0:5:12|0:5:23|[Qi Jia], in a daze, was helped out of the hall by [Lin Shuer]. As the scene unfolds, a few words fall down and gradually merge with a gynecological medical record, with the title appearing: "My Early Menopausal Girlfriend".
0:5:23|0:5:37|In this film, [Qi Jia] had been in a relationship with her [Ex-Boyfriend] for many years, and their relationship had always been very good. However, to [Qi Jia]'s surprise, her [Ex-Boyfriend], whom she thought she would marry and have a wedding with, unexpectedly rejected her on the day of their graduation.
0:5:37|0:5:40|From then on, [Qi Jia]'s nightmare began.
0:5:41|0:5:46|The failed love experience has plunged [Qi Jia] into an unbearable pain.
0:5:46|0:5:50|A series of menopausal symptoms appeared successively on the young [Qi Jia].
0:5:50|0:6:1|Just then, a man named [Yuan Xiaoou] suddenly barged into his life, the hospital corridor was bustling with noise and people, [Qi Jia] sat on a bench outside the gynecology clinic.
0:6:1|0:6:7|He cut his hair short, leaving a short bangs above his eyebrows, and after exchanging a glance with the big brother next to him, he looked away.
0:6:8|0:6:11|The middle-aged woman in the clinic wiped her sweat and said to [Doctor].
0:6:55|0:6:58|[The doctor] leaned in close to [Qi Jia]'s face, carefully examining it.
0:7:0|0:7:2|[Doctor] lowered his head to look through the medical records.
0:7:16|0:7:20|[Qi Jia] stood up in anger and squatted deeply in front of the [doctor].
0:7:20|0:7:23|The doctor's eyes followed the figure of [Qi Jia] up and down.
0:7:24|0:7:27|[Qi Jia] cursed while picking up the cactus on the table and thrusting it towards the face of the [doctor].
0:7:51|0:7:54|[Qi Jia] is lying on the lawn wearing sunglasses.
0:7:54|0:7:56|[Lin Shuer] bent down and looked at her, saying.
0:7:58|0:8:0|Lin Shuer knelt beside Qi Jia.
0:8:18|0:8:21|[Ling Shuer] stuffs [Qi Jia] into the passenger seat of the sports car.
0:8:31|0:8:36|Every year at this time, graduates always dress up the peaceful summer nights wildly and catch up.
0:8:49|0:8:56|On the day of graduation, [Qi Jia] in a wedding dress, leaning on the railing and vomiting, sat on the steps under the shade of a tree with Lin Shuer.
0:9:3|0:9:10|[Qi Jia] pouted in grievance, burying her head on Lin Shuer's shoulder, who quickly patted her to show comfort.
0:9:31|0:9:44|On the balcony of the dormitory building, countless sheets hang down, expressing the sadness of parting. Some people are lighting candles and drinking beer on the grass, while others are sitting in a circle singing loudly. A long-haired man is desperately grabbing a short-haired man and shouting.
0:9:48|0:9:56|[Qi Jia] and Lin Shuer laughed until their stomachs hurt, when suddenly two guys wearing only underwear ran out onto the street.
0:10:9|0:10:12|Lin Shuer, who is 1.8 meters tall, simply lifted up [Qi Jia].
0:10:15|0:10:22|Ling Shuer ran up the stairs with her family in her arms, and the two of them stumbled to the dormitory door.
0:10:22|0:10:25|Ling Shuer reached out and twisted the doorknob.
0:10:27|0:10:31|Ling Shuer pressed her ear against the door and listened intently.
0:10:50|0:10:59|Glancing back into the room, [Qi Jia] blushed lazily, looking disoriented as she hurriedly ran down the stairs clutching her clothes.
0:10:59|0:11:5|In a panic, she left a sneaker in the hallway and [Qi Jia] quickly turned on the light and rushed into the dormitory.
0:11:59|0:12:10|Old Bai, with his shirt not properly buttoned, walked towards the door carrying a storage box, then turned around to bid farewell.
0:12:10|0:12:15|The dormitory door was closed by Lao Bai, and the oil painting on the door gradually turned into a real alleyway.
0:12:27|0:12:33|On the wall of the alley lies a pear blossom cat, and at the foot of the wall lies a homeless man sleeping on a makeshift bed.
0:12:33|0:12:39|He stood up and looked towards a corner not far away, where [Yuan Xiaoou] was sitting, gnawing on sugar cane, with a pile of luggage beside her.
0:12:43|0:12:50|[Yuan Xiaoou] ignored the beggar while gnawing on the sugar cane, as he stood up muttering to himself.
0:12:50|0:13:5|He saw her leaving the house and immediately rushed up to snatch the bag.
0:13:5|0:13:9|[Yuan Xiaoou] turned around and saw someone being pulled by a beggar, immediately rushed over with a sugarcane in her mouth.
0:13:13|0:13:18|[Yuan Xiaoou] shields [Qi Jia] behind her and points at the vagrant with a sugarcane.
0:13:18|0:13:22|[Yuan Xiaoou] sprayed the sugarcane residue in her mouth all over the homeless man.
0:13:32|0:13:37|[Yuan Xiaoou] handed the keys in his pocket to the homeless man, who then squatted down and cursed while crying.
0:13:42|0:13:46|She locked eyes with [Qi Jia] and immediately turned her head without saying a word.
0:13:51|0:13:57|The door was pushed open, [Qi Jia] walked in with [Yuan Xiaoou], and Lin Shuer on the sofa stood up in surprise.
0:14:26|0:14:29|Qi Jia pulled Lin Shuer to the window and pleaded.
0:15:14|0:15:16|They cleared out a room for [Yuan Xiaoou] to stay in.
0:15:16|0:15:18|Lin Shuer reminded Qi Jia.
0:15:22|0:15:28|Watching Lin Shuer leave, [Yuan Xiaoou] breathed a sigh of relief, lowering her head with a triumphant smile.
0:15:28|0:15:29|Time passes by.
0:15:32|0:15:39|A sports car pulled up to the stairs of the lane, Lin Shuer parked the car, and [Qi Jia] climbed down from the passenger seat.
0:15:40|0:15:42|Lin Shuer lifted [Qi Jia] up.
0:15:48|0:15:49|The two of them walked with their heads held high.
0:17:3|0:17:6|[Yuan Xiaoou] carried [Qi Jia] back to the room.
0:17:6|0:17:8|[Qi Jia] went to the hospital today.
0:17:8|0:17:10|Lin Shuer continued speaking while holding a water cup.
0:17:26|0:17:28|[Yuan Xiaoou], still wearing an apron, asked.
0:17:37|0:17:40|[Yuan Xiaoou] closed her eyes tightly and uttered a single word.
0:17:41|0:17:43|Lin Shuer looked at her with interest.
0:18:8|0:18:12|Lin Shuer turned and walked away, leaving [Yuan Xiaoou] standing there in a daze.
0:18:12|0:18:17|The bedroom was dimly lit, [Yuan Xiaoou] sat on the edge of the bed, wiping [Qi Jia]'s hands with a towel.
0:18:17|0:18:23|[Qi Jia] is sound asleep, but her hand is restlessly pulling away from the towel.
0:18:23|0:18:28|[Yuan Xiaoou] continued to gently wipe her wrist with a towel, holding onto it persistently.
0:18:30|0:18:41|Qi Jia tossed and turned like a child in her dreams, her head on the pillow, sometimes facing up and sometimes on her side, suddenly breaking free from the hand held by [Yuan Xiaoou].
0:18:41|0:18:49|[Yuan Xiaoou] finally stopped and gazed at [Qi Jia] for a long time, her gentle face resembling the way she used to sneak glances at [Qi Jia] in college.
0:18:50|0:18:57|At that moment, he hid behind the bookshelves in the library, peering through the cracks at Qi Jia who was reading.
0:18:57|0:19:2|Qi Jia looked up, but he instantly squatted down like a shy turtle.
0:19:2|0:19:7|Until Qi Jia looked away, he finally agreed to shuffle a few steps forward along the bookshelf.
0:19:7|0:19:13|[Yuan Xiaoou] walked quietly, but her eyes never left Qi Jia, who was reading on the sofa.
0:19:13|0:19:15|Liu Chong entered his line of sight while holding a cat.
0:19:18|0:19:23|Liu Chong hugged Qi Jia, playing with the small kitten in their hands together.
0:19:23|0:19:29|The two of them cuddled on the sofa for a while, then picked up the cat and left the library arm in arm.
0:19:29|0:19:37|[Yuan Xiaoou] put down the book in front of her face, leaned against the window, biting her hand, and cried softly.
0:19:37|0:19:45|Awakening from a dream, [Yuan Xiaoou] sees [Qi Jia] sitting on the edge of the bed, staring at him.
0:19:50|0:19:52|[Yuan Xiaoou] raised her hand and wiped her eyes.
0:19:57|0:20:3|[Qi Jia] stood up, but involuntarily leaned towards the wall, using her shoulder to slide along the wall, inch by inch.
0:20:3|0:20:8|She turned around and leaned against the wall, frowning and clutching her stomach.
0:20:18|0:20:23|[Qi Jia] walked to the window while drinking water, and gulped down the entire glass.
0:20:23|0:20:25|He looked out the window and let out a long sigh.
0:20:25|0:20:28|[Yuan Xiaoou] also relaxed with him.
0:21:9|0:21:11|[Qi Jia] stared at [Yuan Xiaoou], clearly this sentence hit a nerve with her.
0:21:11|0:21:13|[Qi Jia] walked away holding her stomach, while [Yuan Xiaoou] continued to chatter incessantly.
0:21:53|0:21:58|[Qi Jia] was so angry that she was speechless, and immediately ordered the person to leave.
0:21:58|0:22:2|[Yuan Xiaoou] huffed, turned around and walked away without closing the door.
0:22:2|0:22:5|[Qi Jia] was about to slam the door shut, but was blocked by [Yuan Xiaoou].
0:22:5|0:22:7|She held up a photo and said.
0:22:19|0:22:23|[Qi Jia] pushes the door open in frustration, while [Yuan Xiaoou] leans against the door outside, determined.
0:22:27|0:22:31|Qi Jia picked up a photo from the ground, it was their graduation photo.
0:22:31|0:22:36|[Qi Jia] is dressed in a wedding gown, standing out among the black robes.
0:22:36|0:22:38|He straightened up, with his mouth half open.
0:22:53|0:23:1|Qi Jia lowered her arm, tears streaming down her face. In a hospital that combined Eastern and Western medicine, the [Doctor] was giving a lecture.
0:24:25|0:24:30|[Yuan Xiaoou] came back with a cactus, placed it on the table, and pushed it in front of [the doctor].
0:24:30|0:24:32|The doctor shrank back in fear.
0:24:32|0:24:37|Watching [Yuan Xiaoou] leave, [Qi Jia] quickly threw the cactus into the trash can.
0:24:37|0:24:40|In an outdoor setting, Lin Shuer elegantly pours red wine while sitting.
0:25:10|0:25:16|[Yuan Xiaoou] points at Ling Shuer, standing still and leaving quietly in the peaceful and warm alley at night.
0:25:16|0:25:25|[Qi Jia] sat on the window sill in the bedroom, swinging her legs outside. She held onto the top of the window frame with both hands, closed her eyes, and breathed in the outdoor air with intoxication.
0:25:25|0:25:31|[Yuan Xiaoou] returned with bags in hand, looked up to see dangling legs, waiting for the moment of release.
0:26:10|0:26:18|The passerby that Wen Sheng refused to let in was surrounded by onlookers at the alley entrance. [Yuan Xiaoou] quickly rushed into the house, ran into [Qi Jia]'s bedroom, and closed the window.
0:26:24|0:26:26|Yuan Xiaoou's hand resting on Qi Jia's shoulder hangs in mid-air.
0:27:0|0:27:4|[Yuan Xiaoou] covered one eye, blood streaming from her nose, and walked out the door.
0:27:6|0:27:8|At a barbecue stall by the roadside.
0:27:51|0:27:55|[Yuan Xiaoou] quickly comforted [Qi Jia] to sit down, and then pressed down the bottle of wine she picked up.
0:28:18|0:28:26|Yuan Xiaoou took the grilled meat handed over by the waiter, then pressed down on the wine in Qi Jia's hand, handing him a skewer of chicken wings, before picking up another skewer herself.
0:28:30|0:28:34|[Qi Jia] takes a bite and immediately speaks.
0:28:34|0:28:38|[Yuan Xiaoou] quickly signaled the waiter to stop talking.
0:28:38|0:28:40|Urge [Qi Jia] to sit down again.
0:28:55|0:28:58|[Qi Jia] picked up the bottle of wine and smashed it on the table twice.
0:28:58|0:29:1|Seeing that the wine bottle didn't break, [Qi Jia] smashed it towards the head of [Yuan Xiaoou].
0:29:1|0:29:7|The wine bottle shattered in half, [Qi Jia] walked towards the waiter.
0:29:7|0:29:9|[Yuan Xiaoou] hugged [Qi Jia] around the waist.
0:29:17|0:29:21|[Yuan Xiaoou] dragged [Qi Jia] to the roadside and stuffed him into a taxi.
0:29:21|0:29:29|The taxi speeds away.
0:29:29|0:29:34|The car almost hit a group of muscular men with round tattoos, who were heading towards the barbecue stall.
0:29:34|0:29:37|[Yuan Xiaoou] hurriedly walked ahead of them and entered the store.
0:29:39|0:29:43|He imitated the tattooed man's posture and swaggered towards the waiter.
0:29:43|0:29:46|The waiter panicked.
0:29:46|0:29:49|[Yuan Xiaoou] adjusted her waistband and said to the waiter.
0:30:15|0:30:18|The waiter quickly sat up and squatted down in place.
0:30:25|0:30:31|The waiter squatted down and smiled at the table with the tattooed people.
0:30:31|0:30:38|[Yuan Xiaoou] whistled as she walked into the alley and was surprised to see Qi Jia leaning against the wall, looking drunk and unsteady.
0:30:38|0:30:48|[Yuan Xiaoou] rushed forward, clumsily embracing him, while Qi Jia stood there like a puppet, letting him manipulate her.
0:30:51|0:30:53|[Yuan Xiaoou] encouraged [Qi Jia] and lifted her up horizontally.
0:30:56|0:31:0|Another night, [Qi Jia] leaned drunkenly against the wall again, and [Yuan Xiaoou] rushed over.
0:31:1|0:31:3|The delivery guy at the door asked.
0:31:22|0:31:25|[Yuan Xiaoou] took the pen and signed the document.
0:31:31|0:31:34|[Qi Jia] snatched the package from under [Yuan Xiaoou]'s armpit.
0:31:37|0:31:39|She looked at the paper box unsteadily.
0:31:50|0:32:3|[Qi Jia] swayed back and forth, rubbing her chest, pointed at [Yuan Xiaoou], and picked up the box with the words "Liu Chong" on it, holding it close to her chest.
0:32:3|0:32:6|[Qi Jia] pushes the door open and walks into the building, while [Yuan Xiaoou] hangs her head in sorrow and anger.
0:32:15|0:32:18|[Qi Jia] sat cross-legged at the head of the bed, tears streaming down her face.
0:32:37|0:32:45|The next day, [Qi Jia] was lying quietly in a bed of petals wearing a vintage chiffon dress, holding a crystal ball in her hand.
0:32:48|0:32:53|In the early morning, in the deserted alley, [Yuan Xiaoou] holds [Qi Jia] and runs like crazy.
0:32:53|0:33:0|[Qi Jia]'s slender arms hung behind her waist, like a doll that could break at any moment.
0:33:0|0:33:20|Passersby on the street turned to look at them, [Yuan Xiaoou] quickly disappeared at the end of the road. In a single hospital room, [Lin Shuer] walked to the bedside screen, [Qi Jia] lying on the bed couldn't help but press her stomach, watching her close her eyes and gasp lightly. [Lin Shuer] sat down, leaning on the edge of the bed and said.
0:33:34|0:33:39|[Ling Shuer] looked at him speechlessly, then turned her head to persuade him.
0:33:45|0:33:50|[Ling Shuer] showed a hint of jealousy between her eyebrows and finally asked the long-hidden mystery in her heart.
0:33:56|0:34:0|[Qi Jia] turned her head to the side, with her back facing [Ling Shuer] who was about to sleep.
0:34:0|0:34:1|[Ling Shuer] walked up to [Qi Jia].
0:34:9|0:34:15|Qi Jia's tears slid into her ears, and she recalled and shared her inner journey.
0:34:23|0:34:27|She still doesn't look at [Lin Shuer], remained silent for a few seconds before continuing.
0:34:32|0:34:37|[Yuan Xiaoou] pushed the door open and walked quietly to [Qi Jia]'s bedside.
0:35:6|0:35:8|[Yuan Xiaoou] nods.
0:35:14|0:35:16|[Qi Jia] turned around and looked at the ceiling.
0:35:19|0:35:25|Lin Shuer and [Yuan Xiaoou] shouted at the same time, but went in opposite directions, the scenery outside the car window receding.
0:35:31|0:35:41|[Qi Jia] saw [Yuan Xiaoou] turn her head and immediately glared back.
0:35:41|0:35:50|The sports car sped along the coastal highway, with fishing boats outside the window quickly disappearing into the greenery. The setting sun half-dipped the sea surface in shimmering gold.
0:35:51|0:35:57|In the outskirts villa, the rapeseed flowers are in full bloom, Lin Shuer drives the car onto the small road in the flower field.
0:35:57|0:36:2|As soon as the car stopped, [Qi Jia] opened the back door and quickly walked towards the flower bushes.
0:36:2|0:36:5|Lin Shuer got off the car and shouted.
0:36:11|0:36:13|[Qi Jia] scolded as she saw [Yuan Xiaoou] getting out of the car.
0:36:27|0:36:36|[Qi Jia] and Lin Shuer ran to the depths of the flower field, looked around, and then squatted down. The flower field was quiet, as if no one had ever been there.
0:36:36|0:36:47|After a while, [Qi Jia] and [Yuan Xiaoou] lightly supported themselves on the half-height rapeseed flowers, leisurely strolling and spinning in the flower field, playfully walking out of the field arm in arm.
0:36:47|0:36:54|The car drove to the entrance of a farmhouse by a small bridge, and in a blink of an eye, the three of them were sitting in the yard having dinner.
0:37:22|0:37:25|[Lin Shuer] immediately grabbed the meat.
0:37:25|0:37:39|[Qi Jia] borrowed a tablet, and on the screen was a runaway wedding dress.
0:38:30|0:38:36|On a rainy night, [Lin Shuer] fell asleep in the passenger seat, while [Yuan Xiaoou] continued driving.
0:38:36|0:38:38|[Qi Jia] remembered what [Liu Chong] said.
0:39:26|0:39:28|The two of them stood facing each other in silence across the bushes.
0:39:41|0:40:7|[Liu Chong] glanced at the dormitory building, then turned and walked away. [Qi Jia] also left in a huff, memories fading. Leaning against the car window, [Qi Jia] silently shed tears, his profile illuminated by the street lamp, tears shimmering faintly. Catching a glimpse of [Qi Jia]'s expression in the rearview mirror, [Yuan Xiaoou] immediately handed him a tissue. [Qi Jia] smiled faintly.
0:40:7|0:40:13|Quietly closing her eyes, [Yuan Xiaoou] twitched at the corner of her mouth and reluctantly took back the tissue.
0:40:13|0:40:19|She glanced at the roadside, turned the steering wheel to the right, the car flashed its lights, and stopped under the street lamp.
0:40:19|0:40:24|The torrential rain pounded on the car, making it almost impossible to see the faces inside.
0:40:24|0:40:31|[Yuan Xiaoou] lowered her head to unbuckle her seatbelt, turned towards the back seat, extended her arm, and wiped away [Qi Jia]'s tears.
0:40:31|0:40:34|She carefully used a tissue to touch the corner of [Qi Jia]'s eye.
0:41:45|0:41:48|[Liu Chong] leaned back on the sofa, looking relieved.
0:42:29|0:42:35|In the hotel, [Qi Jia] closed the door after receiving a large package.
0:42:35|0:42:49|On the floor of the room lay an opened gift box. [Qi Jia] stood in front of the mirror in a shirt and jeans, holding a section of wedding dress, comparing it to herself, and then hugging it close.
0:42:49|0:42:57|On the grass outside a Gothic Catholic church, guests chatted in small groups, while [Liu Chong] in formal attire greeted the guests.
0:42:59|0:43:5|In the room, [Yuan Xiaoou] is trying on a shirt in front of the mirror, then putting on a slightly tight groomsman suit.
0:43:5|0:43:9|[Lin Shuer] is wearing a sleeveless dress, looking around in the corridor.
0:43:20|0:43:31|A bright Maserati convertible parked in front of the church, [Lin Shuer] hurried forward to open the door. With her face covered by a veil, [Qi Jia] stepped out of the car and whispered.
0:43:43|0:43:45|[Qi Jia] and Lin Shuer walked into the church side by side.
0:43:55|0:44:3|Ling Shuer elegantly escorts [Qi Jia] to Liu Chong's side. Liu Chong extends his arm to [Qi Jia], and when she links arms with him, he senses something amiss and asks.
0:44:6|0:44:11|[Qi Jia] kept her head down and didn't say a word, just kept walking forward, while [Yuan Xiaoou] raised her face and clapped.
0:44:32|0:44:45|[Qi Jia] turned her face to the side, remaining silent for a long time. Liu Chong's smile gradually faded, while [Yuan Xiaoou] and Lin Shuer on both sides anxiously watched them.
0:44:45|0:44:48|[Qi Jia] suddenly lifts the veil and turns to Liu Chong.
0:45:34|0:45:38|Liu Chong looked at [Qi Jia] with a complicated expression in his eyes, and [Qi Jia] turned her head to look down the aisle.
0:45:38|0:45:59|He also turned around to look, and the guests in the seats all turned their heads. The real bride, wearing the exact same wedding dress as [Qi Jia], walked slowly towards them. [Qi Jia] looked flustered and glanced at [Yuan Xiaoou], who had a cold expression. Then she looked at Lin Shuer with concern in his eyes, and at Liu Chong with worry and anxiety. Tears filled [Qi Jia]'s eyes.
0:45:59|0:46:1|In the blink of an eye, they all rushed to fall down one after another.
0:46:1|0:46:5|Finally, he lifted the hem of the dress and ran towards the entrance of the church as if escaping.
0:46:21|0:46:26|[Qi Jia] passed by the bride, and the guests' eyes followed [Qi Jia] as she ran out of the church.
0:46:28|0:46:41|Yuan Xiaoou made a tough statement and then followed Lin Shuer out. The guests' attention returned to Xingyun in front of them. Liu Chong held the bride's hand tightly, and the two watched as Yuan Xiaoou and the others disappeared at the door.
0:46:55|0:47:18|You only know how to fall and bleed, Qi Jia is lying in the bathtub in a wedding dress, soulless, letting the water from the shower wash over herself, with the lights of Beijing shining brightly at night, and the traffic flowing like branches.
0:47:19|0:47:27|In the house, Qi Jia walked into the kitchen and pulled open the hollowed-out curtain of the cupboard, revealing transparent sealed jars storing various grains.
0:47:27|0:47:32|He carefully examined the gaps between the jars, but found nothing.
0:47:32|0:47:37|Qi Jia opened the cabinet below, where a pile of hazelnuts and purple rice porridge cans were stored.
0:47:37|0:47:39|He closed the cabinet door and then pulled open the drawer.
0:47:42|0:47:51|Qi Jia squinted one eye and leaned in to look inside, only to find cold spatulas and knives in the drawer.
0:47:51|0:47:57|[Yuan Xiaoou] heard the sound and came out to see her squatting in the kitchen, then asked.
0:49:15|0:49:19|[Yuan Xiaoou] was scared by Qi Jia's gaze and quickly shut her mouth.
0:49:19|0:49:28|Qi Jia is lying on the bed with a fish tank in her arms, sleeping deeply on her side. The floor under the bed is a mess, with items scattered around haphazardly.
0:49:28|0:49:35|[Yuan Xiaoou] lay on the floor, sleeping among the clutter, as a little turtle slowly crawled past her.
0:49:35|0:49:41|In the early morning, [Yuan Xiaoou] cooked chicken soup and chopped vegetables while tilting her head and holding her phone to call Lin Shuer.
0:50:11|0:50:16|Qi Jia rushed into the bathroom with both hands raised high, then turned back and excitedly shouted at [Yuan Xiaoou].
0:50:16|0:50:21|One day, [Yuan Xiaoou] saw Qi Jia pacing back and forth in the living room, and asked in confusion.
0:50:41|0:50:47|[Yuan Xiaoou] grabbed Qi Jia and quickly brought a bowl of soup from the kitchen to her.
0:50:54|0:50:58|[Yuan Xiaoou] bowed respectfully and pleaded, while Qi Jia turned around and spoke.
0:51:24|0:51:28|[Yuan Xiaoou] walked back to the bedroom alone and vomited all the soup medicine she had just drunk into the flowerpot.
0:51:28|0:51:34|In the living room, Qi Jia was about to drink a beverage when [Yuan Xiaoou] squatted in front of her and pushed all the snacks on the coffee table off.
0:51:41|0:51:44|She handed him a few pieces of sushi on a plate.
0:53:1|0:53:8|Qi Jia followed through, yes, every bone and muscle in her body received full relaxation.
0:53:34|0:53:38|[Qi Jia] gradually fell asleep in [Yuan Xiaoou]'s nanny-like coaxing.
0:53:38|0:53:42|The next day, [Qi Jia] slowly opened her eyes in the gentle light.
0:53:42|0:53:47|She sat up energetically, only to be startled by [Yuan Xiaoou] sitting at the foot of the bed.
0:53:47|0:53:49|[Qi Jia] frowns and scolds angrily.
0:54:21|0:54:30|[Yuan Xiaoou] grabbed Qingxia's arm and helped her do ineffective sit-ups.
0:54:56|0:55:1|[Qi Jia] walks out of the room in a professional suit, putting on a small blazer in front of the mirror.
0:55:1|0:55:9|He walked to the dining table, where a conspicuous note was placed. It read, "Qi Jia, please take your medicine after finishing your meal."
0:55:9|0:55:20|Not only that, [Yuan Xiaoou] makes a different heart-shaped lunchbox for him every morning, and [Qi Jia] looks at the lunchbox and smiles faintly.
0:55:20|0:55:29|[Yuan Xiaoou] dragged [Qi Jia] to run by the river, the cinema was packed with no empty seats, everyone was wearing 3D glasses and watching the movie intently.
0:55:29|0:55:35|[Yuan Xiaoou] kept eating popcorn from the bucket, licking her fingers and focusing her gaze on [Qi Jia]'s hands.
0:55:36|0:55:45|[Yuan Xiaoou] was about to hold [Qi Jia]'s hand when a strong wind suddenly blew through the theater, causing the seats to shake violently, creating a very realistic environmental effect.
0:55:45|0:55:53|But [Yuan Xiaoou] was left in a sorry state by the popcorn in her arms, and could only silently gather the remaining popcorn on her body into the bucket.
0:55:53|0:55:55|[Qi Jia] looked at her awkward expression and burst out laughing.
0:55:57|0:56:2|In the beauty salon, [Qi Jia] is wearing ancient bear-style Han needle clothing, lying in a private room doing a mud mask.
0:56:2|0:56:5|[Yuan Xiaoou] is lying on the sofa in the rear cabin, sleeping.
0:56:5|0:56:10|She tilted her head, and the impurities covering her face fell off.
0:56:10|0:56:13|[Qi Jia] took the opportunity to apply a facial mask on [Yuan Xiaoou], giving her a big flower face.
0:56:24|0:56:39|[Yuan Xiaoou] stood up and suddenly saw the mirror in the shop window.
0:56:39|0:56:42|Qi Jia hurriedly slipped away, and [Yuan Xiaoou] quickly chased after.
0:56:42|0:56:50|On the balcony, [Yuan Xiaoou] put the washed clothes into the basin, and as she was about to leave, she sensed something was wrong. She slowly looked down and was shocked.
0:57:13|0:57:18|[Qi Jia] couldn't accept that the turtle had the same name as her. She looked at [Yuan Xiaoou] and squeezed out a sentence after a long time.
0:57:26|0:57:33|At this age, she is in her prime in the world of besties, and what she eats is not so important to her.
0:57:40|0:57:45|On the beach, [Qi Jia] is wearing a coat, paired with shorts.
0:57:48|0:58:4|The two of them sat on the beach, laughing and joking. [Qi Jia] used a marker to write the words "流冲" on the back of a turtle.
0:58:4|0:58:7|Yuan Xiaoou takes a photo with Qi Jia and a turtle.
0:58:19|0:58:32|[Qi Jia] was bitten on the upper lip by a turtle. [Qi Jia] waved goodbye to the turtle with a smile, and [Yuan Xiaoou] threw it hard. The turtle flew in an arc in the air before dropping into the sea.
0:58:34|0:58:39|"Little turtle," [Yuan Xiaoou] saw the situation and quickly shouted to imitate him for a while.
0:58:51|0:58:53|[Qi Jia] ran up to the turtle and asked.
0:59:1|0:59:5|[Yuan Xiaoou] exerted all her strength and threw the turtle back into the sea.
0:59:7|0:59:10|[Qi Jia] took a few steps and turned back, the little turtle appeared again.
0:59:28|0:59:39|[Qi Jia] covers her face with a scarf, and the two shyly lower their heads and run away.
0:59:39|0:59:42|[Yuan Xiaoou] suddenly pointed at [Qi Jia] and then bent over laughing.
0:59:45|0:59:49|[Qi Jia] turned around, his upper lip swollen in a comical way.
0:59:51|0:59:56|[Qi Jia] half opened her swollen mouth, while [Yuan Xiaoou] laughed so hard that she couldn't help but squat down.
0:59:56|1:0:2|The two of them arrived at the lake in the park, [Yuan Xiaoou] holding a turtle and looking at [Qi Jia] with questioning eyes.
1:0:2|1:0:6|After getting confirmation, [Yuan Xiaoou] slowly placed the little turtle on the water surface.
1:0:17|1:0:20|Ling Shuer observed [Qi Jia] at the outdoor table.
1:1:35|1:1:39|In front of the health-preserving Chinese medicine counter, Guijie professionally introduces [Qi Jia] and Lin Shuer.
1:1:44|1:1:51|In a jewelry store in the mall, [Yuan Xiaoou] buys a diamond ring, while the salesperson wearing gloves waits on the side.
1:1:51|1:2:0|[Yuan Xiaoou] picked up the diamond ring, didn't even take the gift box, and walked out of the store. As she walked, she carefully held the diamond ring and put it into her pocket.
1:2:8|1:2:18|In another shopping mall, the female CEO in an exquisite houndstooth suit walked towards the mall entrance. [Yuan Xiaoou] happened to park her car at the door, and she quickly got out of the car to open the passenger door for General Manager Li.
1:2:23|1:2:30|[Yuan Xiaoou] reached out to protect President Li's head, and after President Li elegantly sat down, she ran back to the driver's seat in an extraordinary manner.
1:2:30|1:2:35|Mr. Li put on his sunglasses, fastened his seatbelt, and [Yuan Xiaoou] started the car and drove away.
1:2:35|1:2:38|Inside the mall, Qi Jia and Lin Shuer hurriedly chased after.
1:2:49|1:2:51|[Qi Jia] furrowed her brows, looking somewhat uneasy.
1:2:51|1:2:53|In a high-end restaurant.
1:2:54|1:2:55|[Yuan Xiaoou] took the waiter's tray.
1:4:29|1:4:32|[Qi Jia] blinked and put down the fork.
1:4:36|1:4:38|Lin Shuer glanced at [Qi Jia].
1:4:42|1:4:45|[Yuan Xiaoou] had a distracted look in her eyes, with yogurt smeared on her lips.
1:4:45|1:4:48|Lin Shuer let out a soft sigh.
1:4:48|1:4:57|[Yuan Xiaoou] touched the Eiffel Tower-shaped diamond ring in her hand, silently putting it back into her pocket.
1:4:57|1:5:6|In the Gulf Park, [Yuan Xiaoou] is pushing [Qi Jia] to run.
1:5:6|1:5:7|The two of them ran into the campus.
1:5:13|1:5:18|Qi Jia's gaze was firmly locked on the ancient tree by the roadside.
1:5:18|1:5:30|[Qi Jia] gazed at the ancient tree, under which was the place where he and Liu Chong had their first kiss.
1:5:30|1:5:35|Yuan Xiaoou's gaze starts to dodge.
1:5:35|1:5:37|[Yuan Xiaoou] pulled [Qi Jia] towards the tree.
1:6:5|1:6:12|[Yuan Xiaoou] slowly approached [Qi Jia], her hands resting on the tree trunk, gently and tenderly kissing [Qi Jia]'s lips.
1:6:13|1:6:20|[Qi Jia] suddenly opened her eyes, her eyeballs frantically rolling around, while the branches gently swayed in the warm breeze.
1:6:20|1:6:27|Before long, [Qi Jia] closed her eyes, and her tense body gradually relaxed, immersing herself in this long moment.
1:6:27|1:6:34|The students sketching nearby stood quietly in front of their easels, watching the lovers under the tree as their affectionate gazes intertwined.
1:6:34|1:6:37|[Qi Jia] blinked, turned her face to the side, and ended the kiss.
1:6:38|1:6:45|He looked up at [Yuan Xiaoou], pushed aside her arm reaching out to him, and walked away from the ancient tree alone.
1:6:45|1:6:48|[Yuan Xiaoou] regained consciousness and quickly caught up.
1:6:48|1:6:54|The sunlight filtered through the canopy, casting shimmering rays that seemed like a barely visible diamond hanging from the tree.
1:6:56|1:7:12|[Qi Jia] walked briskly with hands in pockets under the continuous canopy of trees, with [Yuan Xiaoou] silently following closely behind. The lush tree crowns above connected, blocking the sky completely, while the light danced through the gaps between the branches as they walked.
1:7:12|1:7:33|[Qi Jia] and [Yuan Xiaoou] briskly walk across the campus, with lush greenery on the small hill. [Qi Jia] puts her hands in her pockets, occasionally looking back to make sure [Yuan Xiaoou] is following. [Yuan Xiaoou] foolishly imitates her by putting her hands in her pockets and looking back. The two walk to the bridge by the river, [Qi Jia] casually stretches her arms, and [Yuan Xiaoou] behind her follows suit.
1:7:33|1:7:48|The two figures disappeared on the other side of the bridge, as the tranquil lake was suddenly hit by a heavy rain. The fine raindrops created ripples on the entire lake, and mist quickly enveloped the area under the bridge. The rain became even more intense after a muffled thunder.
1:7:48|1:8:0|The students sketching by the river were caught off guard and drenched, they quickly grabbed their palette, picked up their drawing boards and easels, and fled the exposed embankment. Meanwhile, [Qi Jia] and [Yuan Xiaoou] strode forward along the riverbank.
1:8:5|1:8:14|[Qi Jia] crossed the street without looking back, while [Yuan Xiaoou] followed her, half-raising her coat.
1:8:14|1:8:16|Lin Shuer saw them in the car.
1:8:22|1:8:27|[Qi Jia] saw Lin Shuer looking out of the car window and immediately ran to the side of the car.
1:8:27|1:8:32|[Yuan Xiaoou] stood still for a moment, then grabbed the clothes and chased after him. They both got into the back seat of the car.
1:8:38|1:8:42|The two glanced at each other, then looked away, creating an awkward atmosphere.
1:8:42|1:8:46|Lin Shuer immediately sensed that something was wrong and turned to examine the expressions of the two.
1:8:56|1:8:58|No one answered the phone in the car.
1:9:10|1:9:21|Lin Shuer opened the umbrella and pushed open the car door. Outside, there was thunder and lightning, heavy rain pouring down. The water flooded up to his ankles. He stretched out his long legs, placed them in front of the car, and kicked it hard.
1:9:24|1:9:28|Seemingly not satisfied, [Qi Jia] kicked again before continuing to move forward.
1:9:28|1:9:33|In the car, [Yuan Xiaoou] turned to look at [Qi Jia], who quickly averted her gaze.
1:9:33|1:9:35|He took the lead in breaking the deadlock and instructed [Qi Jia].
1:9:41|1:9:42|[Qi Jia] nodded.
1:9:44|1:9:46|He thought for a moment and continued.
1:9:53|1:9:54|The atmosphere froze once again.
1:9:54|1:9:57|[Yuan Xiaoou] swallowed and [Qi Jia] spoke.
1:9:59|1:10:3|[Yuan Xiaoou] widened her eyes and took a deep breath.
1:10:9|1:10:13|[Yuan Xiaoou] smiled foolishly, and a smile also appeared on [Qi Jia]'s face.
1:10:14|1:10:20|[Qi Jia] looked at [Yuan Xiaoou] firmly, and [Yuan Xiaoou]'s smile spread across her face.
1:10:20|1:10:23|Rainwater seeped into the car, soaking the feet of the two without them realizing.
1:10:33|1:10:35|Lin Shuer stood in the water and made a phone call.
1:10:47|1:10:50|The rain was beating down on the car roof, [Qi Jia] was feeling a bit anxious.
1:10:50|1:10:53|[Yuan Xiaoou] tried to open the car door, only to find it locked, which made her feel uneasy.
1:11:7|1:11:9|The water level outside the car has risen to the window.
1:11:37|1:11:41|Qi Jia's [Ex-Boyfriend] lay on the roof of the car and drifted to Lin Shuer's front.
1:11:41|1:11:43|In the car, [Qi Jia] is leaning against the water.
1:12:9|1:12:16|Lin Shuer and [Ex-Boyfriend] continued to argue over the phone, and [Yuan Xiaoou] couldn't reach his mobile phone no matter what.
1:12:16|1:12:18|[Yuan Xiaoou] had to leave a message for him.
1:12:55|1:12:59|[Qi Jia] waved her hands aimlessly in the air, with her legs curled up to her chest.
1:13:1|1:13:4|[Qi Jia] pushed [Yuan Xiaoou] away with her hand.
1:13:12|1:13:21|[Qi Jia] kept staring straight ahead, not getting a response for a while. He then turned his head to look at [Yuan Xiaoou], who was sitting in the water without moving.
1:13:25|1:13:30|[Qi Jia] realized what [Yuan Xiaoou] was doing, rushed over and pried open her mouth, but [Yuan Xiaoou] kept her mouth tightly shut.
1:13:38|1:13:41|[Yuan Xiaoou] finally couldn't hold it in and gasped for air.
1:13:45|1:13:50|[Qi Jia] leaned back against the car window, sitting upright against the door, and the two looked at each other.
1:13:50|1:13:52|[Yuan Xiaoou] wiped her face and leaned in towards [Qi Jia].
1:13:54|1:14:0|He cradled [Qi Jia]'s face, resting his forehead against hers, and weakly uttered the words that had been weighing on his heart.
1:14:4|1:14:8|The cold and lack of oxygen made [Yuan Xiaoou] shiver all over.
1:14:10|1:14:16|[Qi Jia] couldn't help but smile and opened her arms to hug [Yuan Xiaoou] proactively, and [Yuan Xiaoou] immediately embraced her gently.
1:14:22|1:14:27|Lin Shuer belatedly realized that her car was missing, so she hung up the phone and opened a messaging app.
1:14:33|1:14:37|Ling Shuer turned around abruptly and walked towards the car with difficulty.
1:14:37|1:14:42|At this moment, [Qi Jia] and [Yuan Xiaoou] in the car are embracing each other tightly with their necks intertwined.
1:14:42|1:14:49|Several firefighters and [Ling Shuer] rushed towards the car, [Ling Shuer] threw away the umbrella and jumped to the window.
1:14:49|1:14:53|The firefighter comforted them loudly, and [Qi Jia] and [Yuan Xiaoou] were finally rescued.
1:14:54|1:15:5|At midnight, the rain has stopped, and the water from the alley flows down from above. [Qi Jia] and [Yuan Xiaoou] walk side by side up the steps of the alley, heading towards their homes.
1:15:5|1:15:11|The street lamp illuminated the faces of the two, with [Yuan Xiaoou] looking down but unable to hide the smile at the corner of her mouth.
1:15:11|1:15:16|[Qi Jia] wrapped herself in [Yuan Xiaoou]'s coat, hugging her arms tightly, looking magical yet somewhat numb.
1:15:16|1:15:20|Soon, the two of them arrived at the residential building.
1:15:20|1:15:22|[Yuan Xiaoou] called out softly to [Qi Jia] as she watched her back.
1:15:25|1:15:27|[Qi Jia], [Qi Jia] turned around.
1:15:35|1:15:40|[Qi Jia] listened, lowered her head to think for a moment, then raised it to answer.
1:15:44|1:15:49|[Yuan Xiaoou] stood still, gazing at [Qi Jia] for a long time, with many feelings of reluctance in her eyes.
1:15:49|1:15:54|[Qi Jia] saw that he didn't speak, so she reached out and opened the small iron gate of the residential building, and walked in with a stride.
1:15:55|1:16:2|[Yuan Xiaoou] stood alone at the door for a while, then walked into the building decisively, closing the iron gate behind her.
1:16:2|1:16:8|In the narrow alley deep inside, foam boxes are placed to catch the rainwater, and the lane returns to silence.
1:16:8|1:16:14|The next day, with the gentle breeze fluttering the curtains, [Qi Jia] naturally woke up in the city's white noise.
1:16:14|1:16:18|She sat up, feeling an indescribable change in her body.
1:16:19|1:16:24|[Qi Jia] was momentarily stunned, let out a soft sigh, and her eyes cleverly darted around.
1:16:24|1:16:28|He looked down at his abdomen and immediately shouted.
1:16:28|1:16:33|He didn't get a response.
1:16:33|1:16:39|[Qi Jia] shouted as she got up to check, rushing to the door of [Yuan Xiaoou]'s bedroom, only to find a letter lying on the floor in front of the door.
1:16:41|1:16:46|[Qi Jia] squatted down, picked up the letter, and found a blank space on the envelope.
1:16:46|1:16:50|[Qi Jia] stood up straight and opened the letter, unfolding the paper along the creases.
1:16:50|1:16:55|At the same time, the phone placed on the bedside table by [Qi Jia] happened to ring.
1:16:55|1:17:2|The screen displays a voice call invitation from [Yuan Xiaoou].
1:17:2|1:17:8|[Qi Jia] cautiously pressed the answer button, and [Yuan Xiaoou]'s voice came through.
1:17:58|1:18:4|[Qi Jia] pulled open the kitchen drawer, and all the knives were wrapped in floral-patterned paper by [Yuan Xiaoou].
1:18:32|1:18:38|[Yuan Xiaoou] placed the cactus on the windowsill before leaving, sighing with loneliness.
1:18:38|1:18:47|Currently, [Qi Jia] came to the window, where a cactus bloomed delicate flowers. As she reached out to touch it, her finger was pricked by a thorn.
1:18:47|1:18:53|She looked at the blood beads seeping from her fingertips, smiling and speaking as if it represented her body's rebirth.
1:18:54|1:19:6|In the neighborhood, [Qi Jia] crossed the road diagonally, unaware of a large truck honking not far away, which came to a steady stop behind him.
1:19:6|1:19:12|[Qi Jia] stood still in shock, then moved to the side of the road to let the car pass, as a large truck rushed by.
1:19:13|1:19:18|Qi Jia noticed a huge poster of an art exhibition on Lu Dun's face.
1:19:18|1:19:23|He walked up to take a closer look, the main body of the poster was an oil painting of an ancient tree.
1:19:23|1:19:30|Below it reads, facing the sea, spring blossoms, the 10th Xiamen City Primary and Secondary School Students' Sketch Exhibition.
1:19:30|1:19:35|Qi Jia walks in the exhibition hall, carefully looking at the paintings displayed on the wall.
1:19:35|1:19:39|Suddenly, his eyes became puzzled as he leaned in closely to a painting.
1:19:41|1:19:58|The painting depicts a couple kissing under a huge ancient tree. He looks surprised and walks on to see the next piece of work. Every painting that follows shows a short-haired girl and a boy kissing under a tree. The entire corridor is filled with this scene.
1:19:59|1:20:4|[Qi Jia] looked at these paintings, tears welled up in her eyes without her realizing it.
1:20:4|1:20:9|She stood quietly in the corner, tears streaming down her face.
1:20:9|1:20:16|In front of the painting, the girl closed her eyes, knowing that the person in the painting was herself and [Yuan Xiaoou].
1:20:16|1:20:22|[Qi Jia] can no longer suppress the sadness, as if awakened, she looks at the painting in front of her.
1:20:22|1:20:25|She lowered her head, memories flooding in, all of them about [Yuan Xiaoou].
1:21:6|1:21:11|Qi Jia walked towards the exit of the exhibition hall, leaving behind the replica of Yuan Xiaoou and her memories.
1:21:32|1:21:37|[Yuan Xiaoou] escorts the foreign client into the elevator, her expression immediately relaxing.
1:21:37|1:21:43|She walked into the company with her hand on her forehead, and as the members saw her coming in, they all stood up and looked at her eagerly.
1:21:43|1:21:47|Colleagues from all directions surrounded her, scratching her head and standing still.
1:21:59|1:22:3|The crowd cheered and rejoiced, gathering in groups of three or five to celebrate.
1:22:3|1:22:6|[Yuan Xiaoou] turned around and answered a phone call.
1:23:1|1:23:6|The irritable [Yuan Xiaoou] scared all her colleagues around her so much that they dared not move.
1:23:6|1:23:12|A luxurious SUV screeched to a halt at the entrance of the hospital, and [Yuan Xiaoou] got out of the car and rushed into the hospital lobby.
1:23:12|1:23:19|She hurried to the dressing table to ask, but her attention was drawn to a slim short-haired girl not far away.
1:23:19|1:23:23|The girl with short hair stood in the sparse crowd, looking at something, then lowered her head and walked away.
1:23:24|1:23:32|The glass curtain wall in the lobby reflects the empty scene of the hospital, as well as the figure of the girl with short hair.
1:23:32|1:23:40|The short-haired woman took the elevator to the second floor, and [Yuan Xiaoou] immediately followed. She ran into the elevator, taking three steps at a time to reach the second floor.
1:23:40|1:23:48|Wearing a hospital gown, the short-haired woman touched her neck and walked to the front desk of the inpatient department. [Yuan Xiaoou] was about to catch up with her, but stopped in her tracks.
1:23:49|1:23:55|The hospital lobby was bustling with people, most of whom were patients wearing the same hospital gowns as the short-haired woman.
1:23:55|1:24:2|[Yuan Xiaoou] looked at the figure in front that resembled the short-haired woman, following her from a distance.
1:24:2|1:24:8|The woman with short hair turned slightly and then turned right into a small garden, followed by [Yuan Xiaoou].
1:24:8|1:24:13|Her gaze followed [Yuan Xiaoou] as the short-haired woman sat down, while she herself walked towards her step by step.
1:24:13|1:24:18|[Yuan Xiaoou] squatted down in front of her with a look of tenderness in her eyes.
1:24:18|1:24:37|Qi Jia, the short-haired woman, stopped her hand from lighting a lighter. She was holding a cigarette, but it was taken away by [Yuan Xiaoou].
1:24:37|1:24:40|[Yuan Xiaoou] flicked her ears with both hands and spoke in Korean.
1:24:42|1:24:46|The short-haired woman still looked at him askance, shaking her head slightly.
1:24:46|1:24:48|[Yuan Xiaoou] said dejectedly.
1:24:51|1:24:56|She gazed into the eyes of the short-haired woman, then bowed her head in repentance.
1:25:16|1:25:22|Qi Jia's voice suddenly rang out.
1:25:22|1:25:25|[Yuan Xiaoou] turned her head, and Qi Jia was right behind her.
1:25:27|1:25:29|Qi Jia stifled a laugh, watching Yuan Xiaoou.
1:25:29|1:25:32|[Yuan Xiaoou] looked at Qi Jia in front of her, unable to say a word for a moment.
1:25:47|1:26:3|Qi Jia had barely finished speaking when [Yuan Xiaoou] pulled her in, fiercely pressing her lips against hers. Qi Jia wrapped her arms tightly around [Yuan Xiaoou]'s waist, closing her eyes and getting lost in this delicate moment.
1:26:4|1:26:11|[Yuan Xiaoou] wrapped one arm around Qi Jia's waist, while the other hand supported the back of her head, kissing her deeply.
1:26:11|1:26:17|The two were lost in a kiss, with [Yuan Xiaoou] pressing her forehead against [Qi Jia]'s, then pursing her lips and standing up straight.
1:26:18|1:26:23|[Yuan Xiaoou] carried a hint of tears with difficulty, while [Qi Jia] was also teary-eyed.
1:26:23|1:26:30|[Yuan Xiaoou] rummaged through his pockets, then dug into the vest pocket, and pulled out the diamond ring he had bought a year ago.
1:26:39|1:26:47|[Qi Jia] looked at the ring in front of her, apologizing half-heartedly.
1:26:47|1:26:51|[Yuan Xiaoou] knelt down and took [Qi Jia]'s hand.
1:26:51|1:27:1|[Qi Jia] looked at [Yuan Xiaoou] nervously and moved, her eyes filled with tenderness, she choked out.
1:27:4|1:27:11|[Yuan Xiaoou] devoutly places the ring on the ring finger of [Qi Jia]'s left hand, and the miniature Eiffel Tower on the ring shines brightly.
1:27:11|1:27:22|[Qi Jia] burst into tears instantly, covering her mouth to stifle a sob, and was then tightly embraced by [Yuan Xiaoou]. With their eyes closed, the two held each other tightly, unable to help but chuckle sweetly.
1:27:22|1:27:29|[Yuan Xiaoou] spins around in place with [Qi Jia], the two of them seeking fame for their good deeds, laughing happily and brightly.
1:27:29|1:27:31|The screen fades to black, directed by Guo Zairong.
1:27:53|1:28:0|On the day of graduation, [Yuan Xiaoou] sat among the graduates in the audience and witnessed the entire proposal process of [Qi Jia].
1:28:0|1:28:6|Ling Shuer supported [Qi Jia] out of the auditorium, like her classmates around her, watching [Qi Jia] leave.
1:28:6|1:28:7|She bit her index finger, feeling deeply hurt.
1:28:33|1:28:39|A group of boys asked the auntie in the girls' dormitory to let them in, but they were all ruthlessly stopped by the auntie at the stairs.
1:28:39|1:28:45|Yuan Xiaoou, who was drunk, crawled into the main room and made her way to Qi Jia's dormitory door.
1:28:45|1:28:54|She was about to knock on the door, but the door wasn't closed, causing her to fall to the ground.
1:29:3|1:29:19|[Yuan Xiaoou] pushed herself up from the ground, while Lao Bai quietly climbed onto Qi Jia's bed and reached out a hand to pull [Yuan Xiaoou] onto the bed.
