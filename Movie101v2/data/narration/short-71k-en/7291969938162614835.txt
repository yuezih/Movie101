0:0:47|0:0:51|A ship sailed by as [Cheng Yi] was smoking at home.
0:0:51|0:0:55|There are two photos and a plaster statue on the windowsill.
0:1:14|0:1:27|Sheet music and newspapers scattered on the ground, [Cheng Yi] with his legs crossed on a stool, occasionally rubbing his feet. He held a pen in one hand writing on the paper, and raised a cigarette in the other hand, taking a deep drag.
0:1:27|0:1:33|The fan in front of him was not enough to dispel the heat, so he took a piece of paper and wiped the sweat off his hands.
0:1:33|0:1:42|After wiping, he casually threw the roll of paper on the table, picked up the written score, stood up and walked to the piano, placing his newly written score on it.
0:1:57|0:1:58|Li Xiaolu looks earnestly towards the door.
0:1:58|0:2:1|The landlord walked up the steps and sat down.
0:2:33|0:2:44|[Cheng Yi] took out the paper ball that was just stuffed into his left ear, leaned towards the door and then turned around to take out the paper ball from his right ear. The scene shifted to the restaurant, where a man with glasses was holding a ring box.
0:2:59|0:3:11|The man with glasses held the ring box tightly in his hand, smiling. He looked outside the shop and happily stood up, but his smile disappeared when he heard his girlfriend speak.
0:3:35|0:3:55|The man with glasses looked sadly as his girlfriend walked away, while on the other side, [Cheng Yi] sat on a chair, picked up the water bottle on the ground, took a sip, and ran his hand through his hair.
0:4:30|0:4:33|[Cheng Yi] hung up the phone and put the mobile phone into his pocket.
0:4:34|0:4:39|He looked towards the door, got up from the chair, and walked towards the door with light steps.
0:4:39|0:4:49|He pushed aside the thin gauze curtain, peeked forward, listened intently, then returned to the bedroom to change clothes, fidgeted and opened the door.
0:4:49|0:5:1|He first peeked out, noticed the landlord sleeping on the steps, took a breath, silently dug a bit, quickly flashed out of the door, gently closed the iron door with a fierce look on his face, and only breathed a sigh of relief after walking out of the building.
0:5:2|0:5:7|[Cheng Yi] walked on the street, and a man in a suit with his son approached him.
0:6:11|0:6:12|Glasses-wearing man Ah Hui ended up pouring a drink for [Cheng Yi].
0:7:57|0:7:59|[Cheng Yi] took a sip of wine and put down the glass.
0:9:12|0:9:19|[A Ling] put away the perfume and looked towards [Cheng Yi], who nodded and smiled at her. She walked up to [Cheng Yi] with a smile.
0:9:32|0:9:35|[Cheng Yi] shivered next to [A Ling].
0:9:47|0:9:55|[Cheng Yi] called out to [A Ling], approaching her as she turned around.
0:9:55|0:10:1|[A Ling] returned to the counter with a slightly embarrassed smile and nodded at [Cheng Yi], who was looking at her.
0:10:1|0:10:4|The scene shifts to outside the Shenzhen high-speed rail station, where a bright figure is exerting all their strength.
0:10:6|0:10:19|[Cheng Yi] walked out of the high-speed rail station with a bag of pan-fried buns on his back, crossed the road, looked around, adjusted his glasses, took a deep breath, and continued walking. In no time, he arrived at a high-end hotel restaurant where he played the piano on stage.
0:10:38|0:10:44|With the sound of [Cheng Yi]'s qin, a man from Zhongshan Village walked into the hotel with a man wearing sunglasses and a beautiful woman.
0:10:47|0:10:55|At this moment, the men from Zhongshan Village arrived at the restaurant. With his hands in his pockets, Li Xiaolu glanced over, and A Ling also noticed them.
0:10:55|0:10:58|The man from Zhongshan Villa turned around and said to the man in sunglasses.
0:11:1|0:11:12|The beauty linked arms with the big brother, following [Cheng Yi] up the steps, with two bodyguards behind. The three of them took their seats one after another, and [Li Xiaolu] kept an eye on them.
0:11:40|0:11:42|The big brother is hugging the beauty [NIKOLE].
0:11:45|0:11:47|The big brother took out a gift box.
0:12:31|0:12:35|[NICOLE] walked towards [Cheng Yi] with a handbag in one hand, swaying her hips.
0:12:35|0:12:39|He walked up the steps, and Li Xiaolu looked at him.
0:12:39|0:12:49|At this moment, a group of people rushed into the restaurant, with the long-haired man at the front bowing to the big brother with folded hands.
0:12:49|0:12:51|Zhou Biao pointed at the man in Zhongshan suit.
0:12:58|0:13:1|It seems like they are discussing business, but what illegal activities they are actually up to, only the heavens know.
0:14:13|0:14:21|After speaking, [NICOLE] walked down the steps in high heels, [Li Xiaolu] watched her return to Zhou Biao's side and sit down, showing a smile.
0:14:24|0:14:28|He thought for a moment, let out a sigh, then lowered his head to continue playing the piano.
0:14:28|0:14:34|The next day, [Cheng Yi] arrived at the music store, where [Li Xiaolu] put down the instrument she was polishing and greeted him.
0:14:41|0:14:49|[Cheng Yi] heard the sound of the piano and walked towards the piano inside, only to find [NICOLE] playing the piano, his fingers skillfully moving on the keys.
0:14:54|0:14:59|[NICOLE] stepped aside and stood listening as the music flowed from [CHENG YI]'s fingertips.
0:15:37|0:15:40|Li Xiaolu and A Ling met each other with a smile.
0:15:40|0:15:45|[Cheng Yi] watched as [Li Xiaolu] left, glanced at the piano, and then looked at the address.
0:16:0|0:16:7|Cars were passing by on the street, [Cheng Yi] was carrying a bag of fruits back to Hong Kong, and coincidentally ran into [A Ling] coming out.
0:16:28|0:16:30|[A Ling]'s mother, who is also the landlady, walked out of the building, straightened her clothes, touched her hair, and asked.
0:16:53|0:17:3|Saying that, [Li Xiaolu] took the fruit from [A Ling]'s hand and threw it on the ground. [Lin Zai] hid behind the wall watching everything, only to see a man walking up to [A Ling] and her daughter, then leading [A Ling] into the car.
0:17:10|0:17:13|[Cheng Yi] leaned against the wall and muttered to himself.
0:17:13|0:17:17|[Cheng Yi] bit his lip and walked to the front of the building, slowly swallowing.
0:17:17|0:17:27|After pausing in the air for a moment, [Li Xiaolu] picked up the fruit from the ground, wiped a pear that had fallen outside on her chest, and then stuffed it into the bag.
0:17:27|0:17:31|He then held the fruit and watched [A Ling] and her daughter leave in the car.
0:17:31|0:17:36|[Cheng Yi] changed his clothes and arrived at the Purple Gold Flower Square, holding his phone and waiting.
0:17:41|0:17:43|Walking towards the sea while waiting, Li Xiaolu looked out at the sea again.
0:18:24|0:18:26|The big-eyed beauty took the sincere phone call.
0:18:39|0:18:41|Li Xiaolu extends a sincere hand, and the beautiful woman with big eyes turns her head.
0:19:2|0:19:6|The big-eyed beauty dialed the number again, but this time no one answered.
0:19:6|0:19:9|Chengyi wanted to say something but stopped himself.
0:19:9|0:19:16|[Li Xiaolu] waited while casting a sidelong glance at [A Ling] with her big eyes. She sighed as she watched [A Ling] put down her arms in disappointment, hands in pockets.
0:19:16|0:19:17|Li Xiaolu squats down in surprise and picks up the phone.
0:19:29|0:19:39|The big-eyed beauty Li Xiaolu was about to leave, but Lin Zai opened his phone and shook it. Then he arrived at a bar where the dancer was performing on stage.
0:19:39|0:19:44|Ahui wiped the wine glass while talking to [Cheng Yi] at the bar.
0:20:12|0:20:17|Ahui looked up and saw his ex-girlfriend [Anjiu] walking in with a man.
0:20:17|0:20:21|[Andrei] also saw him, but lowered his head and looked past him sincerely.
0:20:25|0:20:35|Chengyi turned his head and clapped his hands, saying, Ahui watched his ex-girlfriend walk away as the dancers accompanied the intense music with their dance.
0:20:57|0:21:2|At this moment, [Li Xiaolu], the big-eyed beauty, walked in and casually pushed her glasses up with no enthusiasm.
0:21:2|0:21:9|The big-eyed beauty looked around and spotted the sincerity on the bar. She walked up and patted Sincerity on the shoulder.
0:21:24|0:21:27|The big-eyed beauty turned around and leaned against the bar.
0:21:46|0:21:49|The prince spoke to the thug.
0:21:49|0:21:50|The big-eyed beauty noticed over here.
0:21:55|0:21:59|She rushed up to [Li Xiaolu] with a sincere look.
0:22:10|0:22:16|[Li Xiaolu] embraces and rescues [A Ling].
0:22:16|0:22:20|When they left, Chengyi rushed to [A Ling] and supported him earnestly.
0:22:34|0:22:41|Later, [Li Xiaolu] arrived at a villa area according to the address provided by [NICOLE].
0:22:41|0:22:44|Climbing up a small slope, they arrived at the entrance of a villa.
0:22:44|0:22:48|He looked inside, checked the address, and then reached out to greet them.
0:22:48|0:22:49|The bodyguard at the door came over and asked.
0:22:50|0:22:50|The bodyguard opens the gate, showing sincerity.
0:23:7|0:23:9|Li Xiaolu walks along the path, glancing at the luxurious villa, while the bodyguard stops in front of the glass door.
0:23:9|0:23:10|Li Xiaolu walks in with sincerity, while a few bodyguards patrol outside the door.
0:23:10|0:23:11|He glanced around the room and saw the piano filled with dust not far from the entrance.
0:23:31|0:23:39|Picking up the music score on the piano, [Li Xiaolu] naturally sat down, arranged the score, glanced around the living room, and then started playing the piano absentmindedly.
0:23:51|0:23:54|Li Xiaolu was actually discussing business with the man with long hair in the living room.
0:24:20|0:24:23|The old man walked towards the outside of the house, with [Li Xiaolu] nodding slightly behind them.
0:24:44|0:24:45|The man with long hair followed and walked down the stairs.
0:24:53|0:24:57|Li Xiaolu and A Ling sat down by the pool, and soon a waiter brought over drinks.
0:25:39|0:25:43|The two walked to the side, and A Ling patted Li Xiaolu's chest.
0:25:57|0:26:9|Ruan Ji turned and walked away, unexpectedly pulling out a gun with a turn, and the bodyguard behind [Cheng Yi] immediately raised his gun as well. [Cheng Yi] chuckled, and at this moment, the henchmen on both sides were all holding guns.
0:26:9|0:26:14|[Cheng Yi] grabbed the money bag on the table and left under the protection of the bodyguard.
0:26:14|0:26:18|A bodyguard was hit by a soft drink and fell into the swimming pool.
0:26:18|0:26:20|[Cheng Yi] looked up at the noise outside.
0:26:52|0:27:3|Outside the house, a fierce battle was raging, and Li Xiaolu's music seemed to have turned into the background music for each person falling down, until several people ran past the glass door, Li Xiaolu stopped playing and stood up.
0:27:3|0:27:5|Soon, Li Xiaolu, A Ling, and Lin Zai were caught up by the thugs with chairs and bodyguards.
0:27:8|0:27:15|Ruan Jiulian fired several shots, leaving two gunshot wounds on Zhou Biao's back, while the [Chengyi] alliance hid behind the piano.
0:27:15|0:27:26|The glass door was also shattered by Ruan Jiu. After Zhou Biao fired a few more shots, he still managed to turn around and fired several shots at Ruan Jiu, but staggered back several steps himself.
0:27:26|0:27:30|[Cheng Yi] furrowed his brow, wanting to see the situation but not daring to show himself.
0:27:30|0:27:39|In the end, Ruan Jiu and Zhou Biao both fell to the ground, the gunshots ceased, and [Cheng Yi] dared to show his head, only to see several people already lying outside.
0:27:39|0:27:44|Zhou Biao spat out blood, and when he saw [Cheng Yi], he reached out his hand to try to climb over to him.
0:27:44|0:27:51|[Cheng Yi] looked around, made sure no one was there, got up and ran towards the door. He looked around at the door before finally daring to walk out.
0:27:57|0:28:4|He didn't notice him under his feet, and was grabbed by Zhou Biao on the calf. He turned a few times without breaking free, and then squatted down to help Zhou Biao.
0:28:27|0:28:32|Zhou Biao handed the money bag to [Cheng Yi], but before he could finish speaking, he collapsed completely.
0:28:32|0:28:42|[Cheng Yi] had one hand on Zhou Biao's shoulder and the other hand holding a money bag. Looking around and not seeing anyone, he stood up, grabbed the money bag, and ran away.
0:28:42|0:28:50|Every now and then, [NICOLE] tried on the wedding dress and returned with the man from Zhongshan Manor, only to see this scene, they hurried over.
0:29:0|0:29:18|Li Xiaolu on this side has already run back to the rental house. He gasped heavily by the TV, was about to put down the money bag, then walked to the window, took a few breaths while leaning on the piano. He turned around, put the money bag on the table, and sat down by himself, leaning back with all his strength. He instinctively grabbed the back of the chair with one hand.
0:29:18|0:29:41|The other hand grabbed the money bag, suddenly as if remembering something, moved closer to the chair. He hesitated for a moment, quickly opened the money bag, bundles of money made [Cheng Yi] widen his eyes. He took out a bundle and flipped it over, then reached deep into the money bag, took out a paper bag, and inside were two DVDs.
0:29:41|0:29:50|[Cheng Yi] held the disc in his hand, pondered for a moment, took a few steps back and forth, sighed, then put down the disc and took out his phone from his pocket.
0:30:4|0:30:9|Hanging up the phone, [Cheng Yi] walked into the bedroom, quickly packed up his things, grabbed his backpack, and left.
0:30:9|0:30:15|He arrived at the Kowloon Through Train station wearing a mask, at this moment, the pedestrians on the street were also wearing masks.
0:30:15|0:30:19|[Cheng Yi] looked around, hands in pockets, and walked straight into the station.
0:30:19|0:30:25|After a car journey, [Cheng Yi] arrived in front of Guangzhou Zhongqing Square, looking ahead with a bewildered expression on his face.
0:30:33|0:30:42|Chen Yi, holding onto the strap, looked around in confusion, unaware that inside the office of the Hong Kong Police Station, the police were already having a meeting.
0:30:45|0:30:47|One giant is dead and the other is seriously injured.
0:30:47|0:30:49|And according to the footage captured by the on-site CCTV.
0:30:57|0:31:0|He took away a bag of things at the scene of the crime.
0:31:7|0:31:10|He was around 6 o'clock on the day of the incident.
0:32:12|0:32:19|Later, because her father was seriously ill and needed money for treatment, she went out to earn money and met Zhou Biao.
0:32:22|0:32:25|But so far, she is unwilling to say anything about Zhou Biao.
0:32:41|0:32:44|The boss glanced at his watch.
0:33:14|0:33:16|Now Li Xiaolu is in the hospital.
0:33:50|0:33:51|He has become a vegetable.
0:33:59|0:34:3|You lowered your head and took another puff of cigarette before walking slowly.
0:34:3|0:34:10|In the hospital, Zhou Biao lies on the hospital bed with a ventilator. The police officer walks over and shows his credentials to the security guard.
0:35:1|0:35:5|[NICOLE] rubbed Zhou Biao's hand and then touched his forehead.
0:35:5|0:35:10|However, Zhou Biao's hand with the needle inserted still showed no response.
0:35:10|0:35:13|At this moment, a knocking sound is heard inside the hotel room.
0:35:15|0:35:33|[Cheng Yi] sprang up from the bed, thought for a moment, got up cautiously and walked over to open the door, only to find Zhou Biao glaring at him with a knife in hand, ready to stab. [Cheng Yi] quickly stepped back and explained.
0:35:33|0:35:37|[Cheng Yi] stood up in panic, gasping for breath.
0:35:43|0:35:52|Later, [Cheng Yi] left the hotel and went to a barbershop, where the barber finally adjusted his hairstyle. He looked at his new hairstyle in the mirror.
0:35:52|0:36:5|The barber removed the cloth, and [Cheng Yi] stood up and approached the mirror. He ran his hand through his hair a couple of times, took off his old glasses, put on the new glasses hanging on his collar, and smiled satisfactorily at his reflection in the mirror.
0:36:9|0:36:12|Leaving the barbershop, [Cheng Yi] walked down the street with a backpack on his back.
0:36:12|0:36:20|At a building entrance, a few young men are loading goods onto a van. [Cheng Yi] notices the advertisements on the walls and utility poles by the roadside.
0:36:20|0:36:25|Approaching to take a look, then turned to look at the utility pole, and immediately tore off a piece and held it in hand.
0:36:25|0:36:30|He looked around and found the address on the advertisement, then followed an old lady upstairs.
0:37:5|0:37:7|[Cheng Yi] said to the open door of the mother-in-law.
0:37:7|0:37:9|[Cheng Yi] had just borrowed the key and was about to enter the door when the door next to it opened, and an old man and a beautiful woman poked their heads out.
0:37:55|0:37:59|[Cheng Yi] stood at the door, thought for a moment, pursed his lips, and then went into the house.
0:37:59|0:38:4|At this moment, a car drove into the alley, and four men in suits and sunglasses got out.
0:38:4|0:38:11|One of them opened the car door, [NICOLE] dressed up beautifully got out of the car, and then walked to the alley with four people.
0:38:11|0:38:18|[NICOLE] is wearing high-heeled sandals, holding a small leather bag in her hand, wearing a suspender jacket over a mesh short-sleeved top, and the necklace on her neck is shining.
0:38:18|0:38:22|A man from Zhongshan Villa walked out with his bodyguard to meet him head-on.
0:38:47|0:38:54|Okay, before Biao went to Guam, he talked to the one surnamed Chen, and [NICOLE] thought for a moment before continuing.
0:38:57|0:39:8|The men of Zhongshan Village thought for a moment, looked to the side, gritted their teeth, nodded slightly, and the scene cut back to the streets of Guangzhou. [Cheng Yi] was walking on a pedestrian overpass, with bustling traffic below.
0:39:8|0:39:14|On the bridge, only a few pedestrians passed by. [Li Xiaolu] walked along the side of the overpass, making a phone call as she walked.
0:39:14|0:39:19|She stood with one hand in her pocket and the other holding a phone, dialing again after no one answered.
0:39:19|0:39:24|She stopped, switched her phone to the other side, and leaned her arms on the railing.
0:39:36|0:39:37|[A Ling] in a wedding dress.
0:40:17|0:40:28|[A Ling] turned to look at her fiancé, who was trying on a suit. [Cheng Yi] swallowed hard, holding back tears, and remained silent for a long time. [A Ling] slowly put down her phone and hung up the call.
0:40:28|0:40:33|[Cheng Yi] put down his phone, bit his lip, took a deep breath, and stared intently ahead.
0:40:34|0:40:41|He walked dejectedly on the narrow sidewalk, with motorcycles parked on one side and pedestrians passing by on the other.
0:40:41|0:40:48|After walking a few steps, he felt the vibration of his phone, took it out and glanced at it, then looked around, and finally answered the call.
0:40:48|0:40:53|After answering the call, Li Xiaolu looked around and made sure there was no one nearby.
0:41:9|0:41:11|He took off his backpack and sat down on the parked car.
0:41:41|0:41:47|[Cheng Yi] hung up the phone thoughtfully, sighed, then continued walking with a backpack on his back.
0:41:47|0:41:52|At this moment, [A Ling] is walking on the street, holding a coat in one hand and stretching her shoulders.
0:41:52|0:41:59|Walking down a sparsely populated downhill road, he was followed by two men in suits, while three others peered out from behind a van parked by the roadside.
0:41:59|0:42:1|[A Ling] wanted to leave when she sensed danger from the newcomer.
0:42:6|0:42:15|A man in a suit stopped him and pushed him, several people punched and kicked him, and forced him into the car at gunpoint.
0:42:15|0:42:21|[A Ling] was taken to a factory where his ex-girlfriend [An Jiu] was tied up and hanging, with tape over her mouth.
0:42:24|0:42:26|[A Ling] tears open the tape.
0:42:32|0:42:34|A man from Zhongshan Village came over playing with a small knife.
0:42:50|0:42:55|Ahui was pushed aside, and [Cheng Yi] approached with a knife in hand, bending down.
0:43:13|0:43:21|The man from Zhongshan Village lightly cut Li Xiaolu's shoulder with a small knife.
0:43:21|0:43:23|[Li Xiaolu] changed her tone and called out.
0:43:46|0:43:56|It's okay, what will be the consequences. [Ahui] was startled by the small knife hanging down. At this moment, inside the police station.
0:44:2|0:44:4|And she has never had any contact with any suspicious individuals.
0:44:35|0:44:37|Zhou Biao still had no reaction.
0:44:37|0:44:38|[NICOLE] continued.
0:44:50|0:44:53|[NICOLE] was unaware that Zhou Biao's finger twitched slightly.
0:44:59|0:45:4|On the other side, [A Ling] returned to the rental house and passed by the door of the beautiful big-eyed girl, only to find a key inserted in the door.
0:45:41|0:45:46|[A Ling] shrugged and followed him in. The big-eyed beauty gestured towards the chair.
0:46:1|0:46:2|[Cheng Yi] was stunned.
0:46:6|0:46:8|He finally breathed a sigh of relief.
0:46:14|0:46:16|Li Xiaolu and A Ling shook hands.
0:46:35|0:46:42|[Cheng Yi] took the business card ordered by Qin Jialu and left, while Qin Jialu waved at her.
0:47:2|0:47:9|In the daytime tea restaurant, Li Xiaolu was reading the newspaper, just took a sip of milk tea, when the phone rang, he picked it up and looked at it.
0:47:33|0:47:34|[Cheng Yi] stood up from the lawn, and A Hui asked.
0:47:58|0:48:5|After speaking, he switched hands to hold the phone, took out a pen, and wrote down [Cheng Yi]'s address on the newspaper.
0:48:5|0:48:8|After putting down the pen, she said to [Cheng Yi] on the phone.
0:48:11|0:48:24|[Cheng Yi] hung up the phone with a worried look on his face, glanced at the sculpture of the musician Xian Xinhan next to him, sighed, and left.
0:48:24|0:48:27|In the Disco at night, Li Xiaolu is on stage as the DJ.
0:48:32|0:48:35|[Cheng Yi] comes in and sees the customers dancing on the dance floor.
0:48:35|0:48:38|Circled around and took another look at [Li Xiaolu].
0:48:38|0:48:40|He is swaying his body to the rhythm.
0:48:40|0:48:44|Looking up, Li Xiaolu saw A Ling smiling at him, and A Ling raised his hand to wave at him.
0:48:44|0:48:46|After putting it down, [Li Xiaolu] found a place to sit down.
0:48:46|0:48:47|Before long.
0:48:51|0:48:53|The waiter placed the drinks and also put down two plates of snacks.
0:48:56|0:49:5|Li Xiaolu touched the wine bottle without drinking, at this moment she took off her earphones, looked at Chengyi who was sitting alone, put the earphones on the table, and walked towards Chengyi.
0:49:44|0:49:49|[Cheng Yi] smiled, watched him walk away, and then looked back at the crowd still dancing on the dance floor.
0:49:49|0:49:54|He took a sip from the bottle, put it down, crossed his hands in front of his chest, and lowered his head.
0:50:0|0:50:6|Another night, [Cheng Yi] was sleeping in bed, while next door [Li Xiaolu] started playing the guitar.
0:50:6|0:50:9|[Cheng Yi] frowned irritably and turned over.
0:50:9|0:50:15|[Li Xiaolu] plucked the strings a few times, wrote something on the paper, put down the pen, plucked the strings again, and then stood up with the zither in hand.
0:50:15|0:50:15|He opened the two pens, and [Cheng Yi] covered his ears.
0:50:30|0:50:32|[Cheng Yi] turned over again, [Li Xiaolu] extended her index finger to find the rhythm.
0:50:32|0:50:34|[Cheng Yi] couldn't stand it anymore, sitting up and fiercely scratching his head.
0:50:55|0:51:1|[Cheng Yi] rushed out of the room, the knocking interrupted [Li Xiaolu]'s singing, he opened the door with a piece of paper.
0:51:52|0:51:57|[Li Xiaolu] looked at the drowsy [Cheng Yi] and smiled, then the camera cut to the police station.
0:52:15|0:52:26|[A Ling] took the piece of paper with the phone number on it.
0:52:26|0:52:30|At this moment, [Cheng Yi] is walking down the stairs and runs into [Li Xiaolu]'s grandmother.
0:52:49|0:52:56|Chen Yi helped Grandma [Cheng Yi] to the hospital, but the Qin family was stopped by medical staff in protective clothing at the entrance.
0:53:0|0:53:5|Qin Jialu took the mask from the medical staff and quickly put it on as she walked inside.
0:53:5|0:53:13|In the hospital, both medical staff and patients are wearing masks. Upstairs, a banner is hung, with the words "Unity in the fight against SARS" written on it.
0:53:13|0:53:22|Qin Jialu grabbed her bag and searched around, looking for the patient who needed urgent care. When she saw the person being brought in, she rushed forward, only to discover that it was not her grandmother. She took off her mask and headed to the registration desk.
0:53:28|0:53:31|He hurriedly ran in the direction pointed out by the medical staff, but was stopped.
0:54:20|0:54:21|Qin Jialu reaches out his hand.
0:54:45|0:54:49|Seeing Qin Jialu pointing at himself with a mischievous look, [NICOLE] curiously stretched her neck.
0:54:49|0:54:55|The next day, Li Xiaolu walked out of the house with a big box in her arms, unable to free her hands so she used her foot to hook the door closed.
0:54:55|0:55:1|[NICOLE] who was reading the newspaper stood up, leaned against the wall with one leg bent, and pushed open the door next door with a hand.
0:55:4|0:55:7|When Li Xiaolu reached out, Qin Jialu helped him close the door.
0:55:7|0:55:8|Downstairs, volunteers are busy at work.
0:55:8|0:55:10|Qin Jialu watched as [Cheng Yi] put the box in the trunk.
0:55:41|0:55:59|Speak up, [Cheng Yi] helped the volunteer to carry a box of water together. After putting it in place, the two of them closed the trunk together and clapped their hands on Qinjia Road.
0:56:1|0:56:9|Qin Jialu pushed [Cheng Yi] onto the car, and a banner with "Love Fills the World" was pasted on the side of the van.
0:56:9|0:56:16|Driving along a stretch of road, the volunteers in the car counted the number of items.
0:57:41|0:57:52|Qin Jialu and [Cheng Yi] were both a bit embarrassed by the physical contact caused by the shaking. The van finally arrived at Nancun Elementary School, and as soon as the door opened, the students shouted,
0:58:29|0:58:34|The two exchanged a glance, and [Cheng Yi] smiled at Qin Jialu, who was waving to the students.
0:58:34|0:58:36|The two walked, and [Cheng Yi] asked,
0:58:49|0:58:53|This is set up for some children who cannot afford to attend classes.
0:58:53|0:58:59|Due to insufficient funding, many teachers also volunteer to help out. The students' stationery and office supplies are mostly donated by individuals.
0:59:5|0:59:7|Qin Jialu watched the volunteers unloading the goods.
0:59:31|0:59:33|[Cheng Yi] lowered his head and dared not look at him.
0:59:47|0:59:50|Sincerely hooked the little finger deep in the Qinjialu.
1:0:29|1:0:32|[Cheng Yi] reached out his hand and almost stumbled, [Li Xiaolu] quickly grabbed him to steady him.
1:0:34|1:0:39|Qin Jialu supported him and finally reached the door. Qin Jialu opened the door.
1:1:10|1:1:18|Li Xiaolu sat opposite Chen Yi on Qin Jialu, expressing her concern.
1:1:18|1:1:29|Qin Jialu stood up and walked away, witnessed by Chen Yi, sitting on the chair that Qin Jialu had just sat on from the bed. He picked up the script on the table and looked at it, while Qin Jialu picked up a medical kit.
1:1:29|1:1:30|Chen Yi asked.
1:1:32|1:1:33|Please ask [Li Xiaolu] to sit on the bed.
1:2:21|1:2:29|Qin Jialu pinched the trouser leg of [Cheng Yi], pointed to the lower leg to confirm, [Cheng Yi] nodded, and then he wiped it with gauze.
1:2:29|1:2:34|[Cheng Yi] gritted his teeth in pain, put down the axe in his hand, and turned his head to the side.
1:2:34|1:2:39|Qin Jialu chuckled, [Cheng Yi] winced again, raised a hand to do something, then pulled it back.
1:2:42|1:2:44|[Cheng Yi] is trying hard to endure the pain all over his body.
1:2:44|1:2:48|Shortly after, Qin Jialu opened the door and took out a key in front of [Cheng Yi].
1:3:1|1:3:6|Li Xiaolu looked at him with a sincere smile, but he leaned in closer, making the atmosphere more ambiguous. Li Xiaolu smiled politely.
1:3:16|1:3:20|The two of them locked eyes, approaching each other with sincerity, one hand leaning against the wall.
1:3:20|1:3:25|Qin Jialu didn't know where to look, glanced down, and blinked.
1:3:25|1:3:28|Faced with the increasingly sincere approach, she finally closed her eyes.
1:3:28|1:3:32|Just as the two were about to collapse, Li Xiaolu suddenly stopped.
1:3:32|1:3:36|Qin Jialu opened his eyes and looked at [Cheng Yi] who was bowing his head, picking at his fingers.
1:3:49|1:3:53|Qin Jialu thought for a moment and then grabbed him.
1:4:15|1:4:33|Looking at the closed room door, Li Xiaolu hesitated, leaned against the wall and looked up, sighed, then looked towards the door again. The scene shifts to the hospital, where A Ling puts a bunch of flowers into a vase. She is wearing a cool camisole today, with a neat ponytail, and after casually arranging the flowers, she reaches out to touch Lin Zai's hair.
1:4:33|1:4:35|Sitting by the hospital bed.
1:4:48|1:4:54|[NICOLE] stared ahead with a fierce look in her eyes, as drops of poison dripped onto the pages of Zhou Biao's book depository.
1:4:54|1:5:0|At this moment, [Cheng Yi] placed the guitar on his lap and leaned over it, writing on a piece of paper.
1:5:0|1:5:4|After finishing writing, Li Xiaolu put down the pen and paper, muttered to herself, and then picked up the guitar.
1:5:4|1:5:4|The scene shifts to a bridge.
1:5:13|1:5:15|Ahui is being held by [Cheng Yi].
1:6:2|1:6:8|In this world, the one I trust the most is [Li Xiaolu], with the waiter leading the way ahead.
1:6:9|1:6:10|The waiter asked.
1:6:41|1:6:44|[A Ling] pulled [Li Xiaolu] to sit down.
1:6:45|1:6:48|Both [Li Xiaolu] and [A Ling] leaned back on the sofa together.
1:7:18|1:7:19|[A Ling] took the wine.
1:7:24|1:7:28|The two of them drank a glass together, and [Lin Zai] put his arm around the girl next to him.
1:7:39|1:7:41|[Cheng Yi] picked up the wine glass, but didn't drink.
1:7:41|1:7:43|Miss Li Xiaolu picked up the fruit again.
1:8:2|1:8:9|[Cheng Yi] took out a roll of money and placed it on the bill.
1:8:9|1:8:18|[Cheng Yi] sat down and glanced at Miss Li Xiaolu. The four of them got up and left, arriving at the D4 Dance Hall on Qinjia Road where Lin Zai worked.
1:8:18|1:8:22|[Cheng Yi] stopped by the dance floor with Miss Li Xiaolu, looking towards Qin Jialu on the DG stage.
1:9:14|1:9:19|Looking at the intimate couple, [Cheng Yi] was very unhappy, and soon the four of them came out.
1:9:22|1:9:38|Ahui left with two ladies in his arms. At this moment, Li Xiaolu followed, turning his head with sincerity, and walked over.
1:9:40|1:9:42|Seeing him remain silent, [Cheng Yi] continued to ask.
1:10:2|1:10:8|After speaking, [Li Xiaolu] turned and walked away. [Li Xiaolu] took a step forward, tears in his eyes as he watched him leave.
1:10:8|1:10:11|And the police arrived to investigate the KTV that the two had just visited.
1:10:17|1:10:18|The TV science team has confirmed it.
1:10:42|1:10:48|His good friend A Hui is also worth noting, their appearance always signals the next move.
1:10:53|1:10:58|Sincerely opens the door of [Cheng Yi]'s room, holding a few music scores and a file bag.
1:10:58|1:11:6|At this moment, [Li Xiaolu] was still asleep. [A Ling] came to his bedside, watching him silently saying goodbye in his heart.
1:11:20|1:11:29|He placed the file bag on the bedside table, put the sheet music in a prominent place, pressed it with a water pipe, then glanced at the sleeping Li Xiaolu before leaving.
1:11:53|1:11:59|[A Ling] and [Li Xiaolu] locked eyes, then turned around and took action, followed by the other police officers getting up and leaving.
1:11:59|1:12:5|Miss Li Xiaolu was still asleep on the Qinjia Road, with a letter left on the table with a music score, addressed to Miss Li Xiaolu.
1:12:5|1:12:13|Qin Jialu sat up and rubbed his eyes. At this moment, Li Xiaolu had already arrived at the seaside by car. Li Xiaolu and A Ling got out of the car, while Qin Jialu was drinking water.
1:12:13|1:12:19|After finishing the drink, Li Xiaolu casually placed the bottle cap on the table, about to leave when she noticed a letter on the table.
1:12:19|1:12:26|He picked up the letter and sat on the nearby cave to read it, while [Cheng Yi] and [A Qing] walked together to the dock at this time.
1:12:26|1:12:31|At this moment, the morning light shines on the sea, everything looks very calm.
1:12:31|1:12:34|Li Xiaolu looked at the score, then opened the envelope and took out the letter.
1:13:6|1:13:15|Cheng Yi followed the direction pointed by [A Ling] and looked towards the sea. The two of them were standing on a speedboat. As the speedboat approached, Cheng Yi finally saw that there were men from Zhongshan Village sitting on it.
1:13:15|1:13:21|The man from Zhongshan Village stood up and walked to the shore. His face changed as he looked towards [A Ling].
1:13:26|1:13:27|The man from Zhongshan Village took the backpack snatched by [A Ling].
1:13:27|1:13:29|The man from Zhongshan Villa's face changed.
1:13:45|1:14:4|A large group of police officers rushed out of the car, and the men from Zhongshan Village and their henchmen pulled out their handguns and started shooting at them. The police officers quickly dodged, while Li Xiaolu looked towards the police. At that moment, the man from Zhongshan Village turned and aimed at Li Xiaolu. Li Xiaolu raised his strong arm, but Lin Zai quickly rushed over and was shot twice. The police officers started shooting towards the speedboat.
1:14:4|1:14:8|At this moment, A Hui blocked on the ground following Li Xiaolu's arm, and Li Xiaolu shouted at him to fight.
1:14:17|1:14:19|But his head drooped down.
1:14:19|1:14:26|The police chased to the dock, only to watch the speedboat getting farther and farther away, with A Ling being carried by sincerity and holding up the upper body.
1:15:16|1:15:19|[Cheng Yi] said excitedly, supporting his head with his hand.
1:15:19|1:15:27|[A Ling] and [Lin Zai] walked in, the questioning police officer gestured for them to sit down. [Li Xiaolu] took a deep breath, and after [Lin Zai] sat down, she asked,
1:17:24|1:17:26|[A Ling] sat down and said to [Cheng Yi],
1:17:43|1:17:49|[Cheng Yi] turned around and faced [A Ling], "If I help you find what you're looking for," Cheng Yi also stood up with sincerity.
1:17:49|1:17:50|Sincerely sighed and nodded.
1:17:50|1:17:56|Li Xiaolu followed [A Qin] in, looking at him sincerely wanting to smile, but couldn't.
1:18:16|1:18:20|Facing the gaze of the Qin family, he lowered his head.
1:18:20|1:18:26|[A Ling] looked at the two of them and said to the others.
1:18:26|1:18:40|There were only Li Xiaolu and A Ling left in the room, and Lin Zai spoke sincerely.
1:18:40|1:18:43|Qin Jialu pursed his lips and, seeing sincerity bowing his head, he said.
1:18:58|1:19:7|Chen Yi tugged at the corner of his mouth, and Qin Jialu finally couldn't control his emotions, rushing forward to hug Chen Yi, tears falling on his shoulder.
1:19:7|1:19:11|Chen Yi hesitated for a moment, but still placed his hand on Qin Jialu's shoulder and embraced him.
1:19:14|1:19:19|Returning to her own place, [Cheng Yi] opens the piano cover and takes out the DVD hidden inside.
1:19:31|1:19:33|[A Ling] puts away the DVD.
1:19:34|1:19:35|[Cheng Yi] thought for a moment, shook his head, and [A Qing] analyzed.
1:19:50|1:19:58|After some thought, Chengyi turned around and contacted [NICOLE], and the two met at an outdoor café.
1:20:0|1:20:5|Li Xiaolu noticed the necklace around her neck and continued speaking.
1:20:23|1:20:27|At this moment, [A Ling] in the car nodded towards [Li Xiaolu].
1:21:4|1:21:5|On the day when Biao Ge had an accident.
1:21:13|1:21:22|After speaking, [Li Xiaolu] stood up and walked over to [Lin Zai], who also stood up and looked at him. Then he glanced at the police before following [Li Xiaolu] out.
1:21:22|1:21:29|Li Xiaolu and A Ling walked a few steps after passing a pedestrian bridge, but a few men followed them, keeping a distance of two meters from the two.
1:21:29|1:21:36|After a few steps, [Nico] became alert, squinted his eyes, slightly turned his head, and quietly reminded [Chengyi].
1:21:41|1:21:45|The two of them quickened their pace, with two men closely following behind.
1:21:45|1:21:51|Suddenly, [Nico] and Chengyi started running, with two men chasing after them. Inside the car, [A Ling] picked up the walkie-talkie.
1:21:57|1:22:3|Reaching a corner, [Li Xiaolu] grabbed [NICOLE]'s arm sincerely, indicating her to split up. The two then ran in different directions.
1:22:3|1:22:20|The two men looked at each other and chased towards [Cheng Yi]. [Cheng Yi] ran into a dead end, watching them approach on the steps. [Cheng Yi] had no choice but to charge forward, but unfortunately his fists were no match for their four hands. Luckily, the police arrived just in time.
1:22:27|1:22:33|They are henchmen of the Ruan gang from Thailand who came specifically to seek revenge on [Nick] and Zhou Biao.
1:22:51|1:22:52|He said.
1:23:11|1:23:14|[NICOLE] brought [CHENG YI] to the table and chairs, and greeted them.
1:23:17|1:23:22|Seeing him looking around and sitting down, [NICOLE] played with her hair, while [程翼] took out a DVD.
1:23:25|1:23:29|[Nicole] leaned towards the chair next to her and took the DVD to have a look.
1:23:57|1:23:59|A man from Zhongshan Village asked.
1:24:15|1:24:20|[Nicole] pulled out a chair and sat down, while [Cheng Yi] stood up and walked to her side, pointing the gun at himself.
1:24:41|1:24:42|He said.
1:24:59|1:25:3|Li Xiaolu, A Ling, and Lin Zai, along with a large group of henchmen, arrived at the bowling alley.
1:25:3|1:25:5|Nico stopped in his tracks and turned around.
1:25:17|1:25:21|Nico lowered his head and touched the necklace, then looked up and said to the man from Zhongshan Village.
1:25:23|1:25:27|The man from Zhongshan Villa nodded and then looked towards [Cheng Yi].
1:25:27|1:25:30|[Cheng Yi] turned his head away, refusing to look at him.
1:25:30|1:25:36|[NICOLE] came to a row of cabinets alone, stopped at the one she knew and looked back.
1:25:36|1:25:41|After making sure no one was around, [Li Xiaolu] twisted the password and opened the cabinet, inside of which was a safe.
1:25:41|1:25:45|He first inserted the key, then looked down at the necklace on his neck, and turned the combination lock.
1:25:46|1:25:52|Repeatedly, she turned the necklace on her neck to complete the password, twisted the key, and indeed opened the safe.
1:25:52|1:25:58|Seeing the suitcase inside, [Li Xiaolu] smiled, looked around, and closed the safe.
1:25:58|1:26:6|Nico placed the safe on the table and opened it, inside were forgotten money and a disc. She took out the disc and smiled.
1:26:6|1:26:10|[Li Xiaolu] and the man from Zhongshan Villa looked at her as she raised her head and spoke.
1:26:15|1:26:20|[Cheng Yi] looked at the man from Zhongshan Manor, and the man from Zhongshan Manor looked back at him.
1:26:20|1:26:26|[NICOLE] picked up the suitcase and stood up, ready to leave. Seeing this, her subordinates also walked towards the door.
1:26:26|1:26:31|Just as they stepped off the stairs, the henchman in front noticed the police and turned around to speak.
1:26:35|1:26:42|Two henchmen are dragging [Cheng Yi] while the men from Zhongshan Villa and one henchman are running in the opposite direction with [NICOLE].
1:26:46|1:26:54|The man from Zhongshan Villa pulled out a gun, but the police had already surrounded them, with [Cheng Yi] hiding under the table.
1:27:2|1:27:8|[NICOLE] held a suitcase, looked around at the men from Zhongshan Village, closed the door and fired a shot towards one side.
1:27:8|1:27:12|Gunshots rang out, and [Cheng Yi] quickly used his arms to protect his head.
1:27:12|1:27:25|The man from Zhongshan Village protected [NICOLE], got shot and fell to the ground. Seeing this, [NICOLE] took out a gun from the suitcase and pointed it at [CHENG YI].
1:27:30|1:27:35|[NICOLE] watched as the police approached.
1:27:55|1:28:3|Chengyi took the opportunity to turn around and grab [NICOLE], but was hit in the thigh.
1:28:3|1:28:3|Sincerity with lingering fear.
1:28:14|1:28:22|The scene cuts to Nancun Elementary School, with [Cheng Yi] limping and using a crutch to walk to the entrance. He looks at the school sign, then heads towards the main gate.
1:28:22|1:28:27|Peeking at the students on the playground, [Li Xiaolu] pushed open the door and walked in sideways.
1:28:27|1:28:30|Everything is still so familiar, [Li Xiaolu] smiles.
1:28:30|1:28:36|Next, [Cheng Yi] slowly walked towards the playground, with Qin Jialu facing away from him, beckoning the students to gather around.
1:29:11|1:29:24|Qin Jialu seemed to feel the gaze of [Cheng Yi], turned his head and saw [Cheng Yi]. [Cheng Yi] smiled at him, so he ran over and smiled back. The two of them gazed at each other like this, and soon embraced each other.
