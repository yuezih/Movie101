0:4:28|0:4:37|After finishing speaking, he turned his head and looked gently at [Xiao An], asking her. Hearing this, [Xiao An] silently answered her father with her eyes.
0:4:38|0:5:11|Soon the father stood up with his hands on his thighs and walked towards the house, followed by [Xiao An]. The father opened the door and led [Xiao An] into a room full of pipes. After [Xiao An] entered and the door was closed, she looked around the room in confusion. Then the father took her to another door and said, "Upon hearing her father's words, [Xiao An] took a deep breath."
0:5:11|0:5:21|Lifting his right hand and placing it on the other hand held by the father and daughter, [Drug Dealer] said a few words, then completely broke free with his left hand and walked away.
0:5:21|0:5:27|The father immediately grabbed [Xiao An]'s wrist and tried to pull her out, making [Xiao An] feel like she had been deceived.
0:5:27|0:5:43|Upon hearing Xiao An's words, the father leaned back slightly, slowly releasing his grip on her wrist. Xiao An clenched her left fist in mid-air, then touched the spot where her father had grabbed her with her right hand. Swallowing hard, she quickly turned around and left.
0:5:45|0:5:56|The father watched as [Xiao An] insisted on returning to the side of the [Drug Dealer], staring fixedly in the direction she left, his body swaying slightly, lost in thought.
0:5:56|0:6:24|At this moment, the movie "Border Storm" officially begins. In the pitch-black and silent early morning, on the empty highway, a taxi is driving. On the other side of the highway, a sedan is also moving forward. At this moment, the taxi is unaware that it is being followed by the sedan, continuing to drive leisurely. The sedan accelerates and rushes out of the intersection, quickly making a left turn to intercept the taxi before it reaches the intersection, while a police car blocks its rear.
0:6:24|0:6:33|Then a young police officer got out of the sedan, aimed his pistol at the driver, tapped on the window of the driver's temple, signaling him to get out of the car.
0:6:36|0:6:53|The young police officer then opened the trunk and found suspicious decorations. He unscrewed the round head cover of the decoration and looked inside. He also found a key attached to the box. After pulling it off, he played with the key in his hand, furrowing his brow and falling into deep thought.
0:6:56|0:7:11|The scene cuts to a young Drug Enforcement Officer arriving at a busy gas station. He is trying to open the door of a large truck with a key, but after unsuccessful attempts, he decides to look for the next truck. He chooses to take a shortcut by bending down under one of the large trucks to search.
0:7:13|0:7:40|The young police officer was surrounded by two 20-meter-long trucks on the shortcut, so he could only walk and observe the next lock target. When he saw the new target, he was ready to act. Before unlocking, he looked around, inserted the key, and the door unexpectedly opened. Then he quickly grabbed the steering wheel and climbed into the driver's seat. After confirming that there was no one in the car, he exited the driver's cabin and closed the door.
0:7:40|0:7:58|Then he circled around the front of the car and found something on the ground behind the passenger seat. He hurried forward to take a look, then bent down and glanced in the direction of the car's underside. After seeing the back of the car, he finally understood what was going on and walked towards his destination.
0:7:59|0:8:25|The young police officer walked into the repair shop and looked around, but didn't see anyone. However, he noticed what seemed to be a repaired tire on the floor in front of the shop's lounge. To confirm his suspicion, he picked up a wrench and bent down to pry open the tire. At that moment, he felt someone approaching him.
0:8:27|0:8:34|Is he the truck driver? He threw the wrench on the ground and walked towards the other person, asking:
0:8:34|0:9:0|The man with a towel in his hands looked towards the police officer and said, "..." The police officer turned around, nodded at him, and walked out. The man stopped rubbing the towel, closed his lips tightly, and walked into the rest area of the repair shop. The police officer, guided by the man, urgently searched in the gas station. He opened the curtain and entered the convenience store of the gas station, then stopped in his tracks.
0:9:0|0:9:15|He felt something was wrong, then slowly turned around to look at the convenience store's curtain and walked back to the auto repair shop. Once again at the auto repair shop, it was still empty, with no one around. However, the police did not pay attention, and went straight into the lounge.
0:9:18|0:9:46|Next to the hot water heater in the lounge, there was a closed door. He looked through the frosted glass and saw that the light was on. After thinking for a moment, he slowly pushed open the door. As the door opened, the police officer stood there in shock. After taking a deep breath, he clenched his left fist and pounded on the door frame. On the ground lay the truck driver, with a large bloodstain underneath him. Two kittens were lying on top of him.
0:9:46|0:10:13|The scene shifts, the camera focuses on the man guiding the police at the auto repair shop, who unexpectedly appears at the Mong Hsu station in Myanmar, sitting on a chair in front of the station with a stool as high as his calf by his feet. At this moment, a man with a crew cut also carrying a similar box walks over, places his box on the chair, glances at the box by the feet of the man from the auto repair shop, and then walks away.
0:10:13|0:10:35|The man at the auto repair shop watched the other person leave and lowered his head. After receiving the new box, this man carried another box into his rented place. At the doorstep, he put down the two boxes he was carrying, but did not rush to open the door. Instead, he stared straight at the door, then slowly lowered his head to look at the lock hole inside the house.
0:10:36|0:10:43|After watching for a while, he lowered his head and looked down at his feet, but found nothing unusual.
0:10:45|0:11:3|He held his breath and carefully pulled the sliding door to the right. It turned out that he had spread sand in the door frame of the sliding door. As long as someone pulled the sliding door, the position of the sand would definitely change.
0:11:3|0:11:18|He carefully opened the quarter door, and then the man shifted his gaze to the keyhole. He took out a key and slowly inserted it, turned it twice, heard the lock click, and the door was pushed open.
0:11:18|0:11:43|Out of caution, the man did not enter immediately, but stood at the door watching. Then he bent down to pick up two boxes. Just as he took the first step, he seemed to suddenly remember something. He stopped, looked up to the top right, where the light bulb on the stairs was missing, leaving only the fuse. After a moment of thought, the man took a deep breath and turned his head.
0:11:43|0:11:49|Looking towards the left light switch, he saw that it was off, so he decided to enter the room.
0:11:50|0:12:0|To prevent the sand under the sliding door from shifting too much, he walked in sideways, thus beginning the first chapter of the movie: Dog.
0:12:2|0:12:27|A large dog, reaching the knees of an adult woman, walked over with a smile on its face. Walking beside it was its female owner, who led it forward with light steps. [Niu Jieshi] was using a chainsaw to cut a hollow pole, which looked similar to what [Policewoman Sister] found in the trunk. After cutting the pole, he sat at the table and polished the rounded end cap, then threw it into the cardboard box.
0:12:27|0:12:41|The Drug Dealer then wrapped the powdery substance in a small plastic bag, rolled it into a strip, picked up a condom and stuffed the strip inside, using their thumb to press it in firmly. Finally, they sealed the end tightly, twisted it shut, and threw it into the box.
0:12:41|0:13:6|At night, the dog and [Policewoman Sister] passed through the corridor on their way home. The dog stopped in front of a door, and [Policewoman Sister] shouted at the dog. Although the dog, Fifi, was obedient, it still stared at the door. After hearing the call, Fifi ran towards the door of the house. While [Policewoman Sister] was opening the door, Fifi ran back to the door again to sniff the scent.
0:13:6|0:13:32|Later, the man from the auto repair shop inside the door stopped assembling and turned to look towards the door. Seeing Fēngfēng so excited, [Policewoman Sister] hurried over. After being scolded, Fēngfēng turned back. The man from the auto repair shop inside the door saw that there was no movement outside the door, slowly turned his head towards the table, and surprisingly found a very hidden camera outside his door.
0:13:32|0:13:55|From the monitor in the room, the man saw Fēngfēng and [Policewoman Sister] return to the room, but before [Policewoman Sister] entered, she looked towards the door, which made the man curious. However, he didn't get up, but continued to sit at the table assembling those decorations, screwing on one round head cap after another and throwing them into the box. The sound traveled through the wall to the next-door bathroom.
0:13:55|0:14:25|Feng Feng heard a noise, raised his head straight towards the wall connecting the next room. Seeing Feng Feng's concern, [Policewoman Sister] came to the wall with a face mask on, leaned her ear close to the wall, and then looked down at her bare feet. Unable to resist her curiosity, [Policewoman Sister] opened the door, wearing slippers, and slowly walked towards the next room. Halfway there, she took off her slippers and kicked them to the wall, then walked barefoot, tiptoeing towards the next room.
0:14:26|0:14:47|Passing by the door next door, [Policewoman Sister] noticed a faint light shining through the window. Finally, she walked up to the door, looked around, and seeing no one, she slowly approached. Placing her hands on the sliding door, she pressed her ear against it. Suddenly, someone rushed over, and she quickly bent down and said,
0:14:49|0:15:2|Feng Feng sat in front of the door, [Policewoman Sister] gestured for it not to bark, then [Policewoman Sister] held her breath and pressed her ear against the door, but it seemed that no sound could be heard from inside.
0:15:2|0:15:16|The door suddenly opened, and the man stood sternly at the doorway. He glanced down at his sister who took a step back, then looked at the crazy guy at the door, and once again scrutinized his sister from head to toe before looking down at his feet.
0:15:16|0:15:50|The policewoman sister lowered her head to look at her bare feet, awkwardly curling her toes without slippers. Feeling the man's gaze on her, [Policewoman Sister] avoided eye contact, swallowed nervously, and then heard: [Policewoman Sister] turned to look at where her shoes had just been taken off, then turned back to the stern and fierce man. After exhaling a breath, she glanced at Fang Fang and said:
0:15:52|0:16:24|After asking this question, she dared not look up at the man's eyes. The man, after hearing it, lowered his head to look at Fēngfēng, and replied, "I've heard it." [Policewoman Sister] awkwardly smiled, and the man forcefully closed the door. [Policewoman Sister] bent down, pulling Fēngfēng along to run forward quickly. She picked up the slipper kicked against the wall on the ground, and in the next scene, [Policewoman Sister] ran in from the door of the choir training room.
0:16:24|0:16:30|She put down her backpack, hurriedly crossed the first row, stood in the middle of the second row, and sang while looking at the script:
0:18:8|0:18:17|The man from the auto repair shop walked out with the door half open and then headed towards the next door, which is the home of [Policewoman Sister].
0:18:20|0:18:40|He took out two iron wires at the door and inserted them into the keyhole to pry it open. Hearing the noise, Drug Dealer hurriedly ran out of the house. Then he deliberately did not lock the door of the neighboring house, where Gangster hiding on the other side of the corridor saw Drug Dealer running out and also went back home, closing the door behind him.
0:18:44|0:18:53|The man walked step by step towards the crazy person in the room.
0:18:56|0:19:5|At this moment, the [Drug Dealer] was screaming wildly at the round hat placed on the table.
0:19:5|0:19:14|The man then took out a gun and aimed it at the [Drug Dealer], his expression cold and emotionless.
0:20:22|0:20:28|The young police officer shook hands with his colleague in greeting, then led the woman out from the inner room.
0:20:31|0:21:8|The camera zooms in, revealing that this woman is actually the Policewoman Sister. As she walks, she complains: The Drug Enforcement Officer immediately stops, turns around, and stares harshly at his sister. Without saying a word, the sister quickly lowers her head, afraid to complain. She turns to look at her brother who is driving and says, The brother asks expressionlessly, The sister, with a clearly swollen face from being beaten, turns her head away.
0:21:8|0:21:12|After being scolded, [Policewoman Sister] lowered her head, looking reluctant.
0:21:22|0:21:25|As they were talking, the car turned into the building downstairs of [Policewoman Sister]'s house.
0:21:28|0:21:33|After the car stopped, the siblings didn't look at each other, but [Policewoman Sister] spoke first.
0:21:55|0:22:14|[Policewoman Sister] sighed and said again, "[Policewoman Sister]" frowned and looked at her brother, who was speaking while looking at [Policewoman Sister]. After giving him a glare, [Policewoman Sister] turned around and said,
0:22:16|0:22:22|[Policewoman Sister] opens the car door, bends down and stands on the ground, holding onto the car door, saying:
0:22:25|0:22:34|Closing the door, [Policewoman Sister] walked towards home with a sullen expression, while her brother remained silent, turning his head to the side, watching [Policewoman Sister] slowly enter the building.
0:22:36|0:22:44|Seeing that she had already entered, [Policewoman Sister]'s brother lit a cigarette expressionlessly, then reversed the car out.
0:22:48|0:23:17|Upstairs, the [Gangster] hitman pulled back a corner of the curtain to secretly watch what had just happened downstairs. Meanwhile, the [Policewoman Sister] walked while rummaging through her bag, searching for something. After searching for a while without success, she angrily shook her bag, scratched her head, and then searched through her bag again. Finally, she took out her phone, pressed a button in front of her house, tilted her head, and put the phone to her ear.
0:23:20|0:23:36|Hearing the response, [Policewoman Sister] hung up the phone and put it in her bag. Then she called out towards the door tentatively. Getting no response, she shouted again.
0:23:45|0:23:50|[Policewoman Sister] was too focused on listening to the noise outside the door, completely unaware of the presence of the killer from the [Gangster].
0:23:57|0:24:28|Finally, the footsteps caught the attention of [Policewoman Sister]. She turned around and leaned against the door frame, watching the killer vigilantly. Then she heard him ask: [Policewoman Sister] listened, her eyes widening as she stared at the killer, her breathing becoming rapid. The killer gradually revealed his ferocious nature, looking at [Policewoman Sister] as if he wanted to devour her. The killer then started washing his hands.
0:24:28|0:24:52|After washing his hands and shaking them off, he grabbed a towel to dry them. Then, with a serious expression, he asked, but received no response. Placing the towel on the rack, he used a threatening gaze towards [Policewoman Sister], whose hands were tied to the bathroom pipe. She said in a helpless tone, "My shoes were taken off and placed against the wall."
0:24:59|0:25:32|Brother turned the key and entered the hallway. As he approached the door, he slowed down, hearing footsteps. [Policewoman Sister] silently shed tears, panting softly. With her hands tied, she looked at the large bloodstains left by the crazy dead. Inside the room, the killer was putting the finished round head cover into a cardboard box. After finishing, he closed the surveillance computer on the table, unplugged the power cord, apparently planning to escape.
0:25:32|0:25:57|When the brother didn't see the [Policewoman Sister] outside the door, he went to the end of the corridor and looked around. It seemed like there was a telepathic connection between the siblings. The brother stopped his steps to leave, while the [Policewoman Sister] was struggling to untie herself. The brother knocked hard on the door of the [Policewoman Sister]'s house, and the sound traveled from outside the door to the assassin's bathroom.
0:27:9|0:27:35|He stood up and walked out of the bathroom, [Policewoman Sister] lay on the ground gasping in fear. Outside the door, the brother came out of [Policewoman Sister]'s house holding a phone, stopped in the hallway. Inside the room, the killer squatted in front of [Policewoman Sister] with a roll of plastic wrap, then started wrapping it from the top of [Policewoman Sister]'s head, layer by layer, covering her eyes, nose, and mouth.
0:27:41|0:27:50|After a while, the remaining plastic wrap gradually decreased, and the breathing of [Policewoman Sister], as well as the cries for help, also weakened.
0:27:54|0:28:1|The hitman, entangled, stood up and watched as [Policewoman Sister] struggled, rubbing her feet on the ground.
0:28:3|0:28:29|Outside the house, the brother tilted his head and held his phone, moving slowly from the house of [Policewoman Sister] to the doorstep of the killer. Inside the house, the killer watched with enjoyment as [Policewoman Sister] struggled on the ground. Driven by the instinct to survive, [Policewoman Sister], with her face completely wrapped in plastic wrap, rubbed her elbows against the wall. The killer stood coldly on the side, expressionless, watching her persistent struggle.
0:28:30|0:28:48|In the bathtub, the crazy corpse seemed to be hinting at something. Even so, [Policewoman Sister] continued to move forward with her eyes and nose together. Suddenly the screen went black, and the second chapter of the movie appeared, titled: Past Events.
0:28:53|0:29:18|In a simple decorated mahjong parlor, there are about a dozen men smoking. At this moment, a middle-aged [Drug Dealer] and a young [Drug Dealer] walk in from the first-floor corridor. The middle-aged [Drug Dealer] looks up at the building, looks around, and notices a not very crowded noodle shop on the second floor. Inside the noodle shop, the waiter is cleaning up the tables after the previous customers finished their meal.
0:29:19|0:29:44|The scene then shifts, and across from the noodle shop, young student [Xiao An] comes out of the clinic with a backpack on his back. His father, the [Dentist], is seen closing the clinic's shutter door behind him. At that moment, on the corridor railing, [Xiao An] notices the former young [Drug Dealer] turning in from the left. He is carrying a paper bag in his right hand, with his godfather following behind. The [Drug Dealer] stops after approaching the railing.
0:29:44|0:29:57|Then he turned and looked towards [Xiao An], who was also silently staring at the drug dealer, who could be called uncle. The drug dealer and the godfather slowly walked towards Xiao An.
0:29:58|0:30:36|Approaching Xiao An, the middle-aged and young Drug Dealers walked up from the escalator and turned left. At this moment, the Drug Dealer walked up to Xiao An and said, "Hearing what the Drug Dealer's godfather said," the Dentist stopped his steps to leave, turned around, and stood in front of the godfather, saying, "The godfather opened his mouth, and the Dentist carefully looked up and said," After that, the Dentist picked up the keys, unlocked the door, and pulled open the clinic's rolling shutter.
0:30:37|0:31:1|At this moment, the two middle-aged and young [Drug Dealers] sat down at the noodle shop diagonally across from the clinic, then ordered two bowls of noodles from the boss. On the clinic side, after the godfather went in, the [Drug Dealer] closed the glass door and locked it. But when he looked down, he realized that he had left [Xiao An] outside, looking at the bright big eyes that [Xiao An] raised.
0:31:1|0:31:4|The Drug Dealer ignored it and walked in.
0:31:4|0:31:9|In the noodle shop, the middle-aged and young [Drug Dealers] started cracking melon seeds while waiting for their food.
0:31:11|0:31:28|They occasionally spit melon seeds on the ground, [Xiao An] was locked outside the door, so she could only hold onto the railing of the corridor with both hands, swinging her little feet boredly, while inside the room, her godfather was lying down following the instructions of the [Dentist] to have his tooth pulled.
0:31:31|0:31:38|At this moment, the two police officers disguised as Drug Dealers walked into the hallway on the first floor and slowly made their way towards the stairs to the second floor.
0:31:40|0:31:45|As the two of them gradually approached the stairs to the second floor, the camera slowly panned up.
0:31:47|0:32:8|This turned out to be a five-story indoor mini-mall, with a plastic roof at the top allowing sunlight to shine through. [Xiao An] leaned on the railing, glanced at the plastic roof, then turned to look at the two police officers coming up the stairs, who also noticed the two police officers disguised as [Drug Dealers], as well as the [Drug Dealer] in the clinic.
0:32:11|0:32:32|Seeing two police officers approaching, the middle-aged and young [Drug Dealers] stopped eating rice noodles. The two police officers pulled out the chairs opposite them, sat down, took off their sunglasses, and then the middle-aged police officer asked,
0:32:38|0:33:10|The middle-aged Drug Enforcement Officer leaned back in his chair upon hearing this, staring at Xiao An across from him as she turned her head and walked towards the clinic. The Dentist thought Xiao An couldn't wait and that's why she knocked on the door. Seeing her father ignoring her, Xiao An walked back to the railing. Finally, the drug deal at the noodle shop began. Upon hearing the middle-aged Drug Dealer's question, the middle-aged Drug Enforcement Officer signaled to his teammate to bring it out.
0:33:10|0:33:37|The latter raised his hand and handed the bag on the ground to the middle-aged [Drug Dealer]. He unzipped the bag, checked the money he wanted, and the other three also silently watched. Seeing bundles of hundred-dollar bills inside, the middle-aged [Drug Dealer] signaled his assistant to bring out the bag, then zipped up the bag filled with cash. On the police side, they opened the bag and found bags of white powdery substance, and then began to take action.
0:33:38|0:33:46|The two were quickly subdued. Seeing the situation, the Dentist hurriedly opened the door and pulled Xiao An back.
0:33:51|0:34:11|After locking the door, [Xiao An] was pushed into the treatment room by the Dentist, who then proceeded to extract a tooth for his godfather. The Drug Dealer on the other side of the door looked over and, squatting on the ground, the middle-aged Drug Dealer spat out a mouthful of saliva and said with a smirk,
0:34:11|0:34:19|The middle-aged police officer immediately opened a packet, licked it with his index finger, and it turned out to be real flour.
0:34:21|0:34:26|Godfather finally finished pulling out the tooth, sat up and rinsed his mouth with a disposable paper cup next to him.
0:34:30|0:34:54|Outside the door, the police escorted two [Drug Dealers] down the stairs in front of the clinic. Before going downstairs, the middle-aged [Drug Dealer] glanced to the left in the direction of the clinic. The middle-aged [Police Officer] also noticed this, looked at the [Drug Dealer] and [Gangster] sitting inside, although puzzled, still went downstairs. Seeing this, the two people inside the clinic felt relieved, but halfway through the walk,
0:34:54|0:35:23|The middle-aged [Drug Enforcement Officer] stopped in his tracks, then returned to the second-floor staircase. He leaned against the railing, surveying the situation inside the clinic. After spitting out some saliva, the [Gangster] turned his head and saw the middle-aged [Drug Enforcement Officer] staring at him. He grinned and then turned his head towards the back, addressing the [Drug Dealer] behind him.
0:35:23|0:35:54|After finishing speaking, he turned around and lay down again. Upon hearing this, the [Drug Dealer] lowered his head, pursed his lips, and looked at the paper bag by his feet. He then bent over, picked it up, and walked into the suite. Seeing this, the [Drug Enforcement Officer] hurried forward. The [Gangster] immediately pulled out a gun and shot towards the door, but the [Drug Enforcement Officer] dodged in time and was not hit.
0:35:54|0:36:6|The [Drug Dealer] who entered the suite found a door blocked by a cabinet. After moving the cabinet aside and knocking on the door, he then went to the bathroom, took out the real drugs from a paper bag, and poured them into the toilet bowl bag by bag.
0:36:15|0:36:31|Outside the suite, a gunfight is taking place. The [Dentist] is hiding under the table, while the [Drug Enforcement Officer] smashes a glass bottle. Inside the suite, the [Drug Dealer] discovers [Xiao An] hiding in the corner and points a gun at her. Upon seeing the [Police] reinforcements arriving, the [Gangster] quickly moves towards the suite and opens fire.
0:36:31|0:37:4|After three gunshots, [Godfather], with three holes in his heart, lungs, and abdomen, fell to the ground. The scene then shifted to the rooftop of the mall, where the glass was shattered. [Drug Dealer] carried [Xiao An] horizontally, covering her mouth, and walked out of the room. They then turned into one of the mall's floors, forcefully kicking open the door to the emergency exit and hurriedly looking for a way to escape.
0:37:4|0:37:12|Seeing the [police] guarding ahead, he stopped, looked around, found a small alley, and quickly passed through the middle.
0:37:21|0:37:40|At the rooftop in the north, the [Drug Dealer] looked down and saw four [police officers] and a police car below. Then the [Drug Dealer] carried [Xiao An] and ran towards the other direction of the rooftop. They arrived at the rooftop in the west, where the [Drug Dealer] noticed a small garden below, connected to a building.
0:37:43|0:38:3|In the clinic, the middle-aged [Drug Enforcement Officer] dabbed the drugs on the toilet seat and took a sip. Suddenly, the [Dentist] rushed in and found his daughter missing. On the other side, the [Drug Dealer] had already successfully escaped from the mall, disturbing many dogs along the alley. The [Drug Enforcement Officer] caught the rushing [Dentist].
0:38:6|0:38:33|The scene shifts, and the [Drug Dealer] has already taken [Xiao An] back to Myanmar. In a trembling state in a forest, [Xiao An] is placed under a tree. Looking at [Xiao An] like this, the [Drug Dealer] aims the gun at the other's hand, but hesitates to pull the trigger. In the end, he gives up, walks forward, pats [Xiao An]'s head, and then scratches his own forehead.
0:38:37|0:38:57|And so, the [Drug Dealer] carried on with [Xiao An], walking through the waist-high reeds. The scorching sun beat down on their heads, while the boatman by the riverbank smoked under the blazing sun. Upon seeing what was happening on the shore, he held the cigarette in his mouth and quickly ran down from the boat.
0:38:57|0:39:14|The Drug Dealer had already carried Xiao An to the shore. The boatman quickly waded through the water, took Xiao An from the Drug Dealer's hands, and then they moved towards the edge of the boat together.
0:39:14|0:39:23|The boatman started the engine, and the [Drug Dealer] sat on the boat lost in deep thought.
0:39:23|0:39:31|With the roar of the engine, the small boat is gradually heading towards the other side of the river.
0:39:32|0:40:2|After getting off the small boat, the scene shows vast mountains and forests. In the forest, there is a narrow road with a car driving on it. Upon closer inspection, the front seats of the car are actually occupied by two Buddhist monks, while in the back is an open-top where [Xiao An] is being fed water by a monk, sitting with her legs bent. The [Drug Dealer] first glanced at [Xiao An], then looked around at the surrounding trees.
0:40:6|0:40:10|The gate of the villa closed, and the [Drug Dealer] slowly led the now sober [Xiao An] inside.
0:40:11|0:40:41|In the villa, the son of the godfather squinted at the two outside the villa. When the [Drug Dealer] approached, he kicked the Drug Dealer hard in the chest. The Drug Dealer covered his chest and squatted on the ground. After hearing this, the Drug Dealer slowly stood up, gasping for breath, and walked step by step towards the son of the godfather.
0:40:42|0:40:51|The camera now focuses on the dirt-covered face of [Xiao An], as the godson points at [Xiao An] and asks the [Drug Dealer],
0:41:3|0:41:13|After hearing this, the Drug Enforcement Officer put down his gun. The Dentist took a men's leather shoe and put something inside the heel of the shoe.
0:41:15|0:41:44|After assembling the shoes, he tapped on the sole and discovered a bug. At the border checkpoint, the [Dentist] wearing these shoes appeared in the queue. After the inspector checked his passport and face, he stamped the pass on it. And so, the [Dentist] walked through the border checkpoint, step by step into the territory of Myanmar. At that moment, a off-road vehicle drove out from a small path in the farmland.
0:41:45|0:41:53|Seeing the Dentist walking towards him, the driver first drove past him, then quickly reversed the car, using the rear end to block the Dentist's path.
0:41:55|0:42:24|The car door opened, and a man with a submachine gun got out of the car. He grabbed [Dentist], shoved him into the back seat, closed the door, and the driver quickly turned around and accelerated forward. They turned into a dirt road in a cornfield, leaving a trail of dust behind as the vehicle sped away. The car drove for a long time in the endless cornfield.
0:42:25|0:42:37|Crossing the cornfield, the car with [Dentist] inside arrived at the crowded town in Myanmar. Inside the car, facing a submachine gun pointed at him, [Dentist] showed no fear.
0:42:37|0:43:8|In a dense forest, the car turned into a fork in the road. The godfather's son flipped through the newspaper and asked the [Dentist] standing behind him. Upon hearing this, the godfather's son stood up from his chair.
0:43:10|0:43:18|[Dentist] was grabbed by the collar and threatened by the other party. At this moment, [Drug Dealer] noticed the secret in the sole of [Dentist]'s shoe.
0:43:32|0:44:2|He didn't make a fuss about the wiretap, but instead touched his ear again and pursed his lips. [Drug Dealer] drove forward with [Dentist] in the car, saying they arrived at a riverside. After parking the car, [Drug Dealer] got out of the car.
0:44:8|0:44:16|He knocked on the car window to signal the Dentist to follow him down, the Drug Dealer pushed the Dentist down and pulled out a gun.
0:44:19|0:44:37|After two gunshots, everything seemed to be back to normal. The clouds drifted slowly in the sky, and the air was filled with the summer heat. Suddenly, [Drug Dealer] pressed a finger to his lips, shook his head at [Dentist], and gently took off the shoe with the bug for listening devices.
0:44:41|0:44:46|He grabbed the heel of the leather shoe with his left hand and pinched the toe of the leather shoe with his right hand.
0:44:48|0:44:53|After simulating the act of dragging a body, the character threw their shoes into the river.
0:44:55|0:44:59|Then he opened the back door and took out a pair of slippers from inside.
0:45:2|0:45:28|Approaching [Dentist], he threw something at him, watching as [Dentist] fell into a reverie. This was during the gunfight, when [Drug Dealer] was pouring drugs into the toilet to prevent the police from finding substantial evidence. Frantically dumping drugs into the toilet, he looked around and noticed that the ceiling seemed like a good hiding spot. So he emptied the dirty stuff from the trash bag in the bathroom.
0:45:28|0:45:40|Pouring the drugs that should have been flushed down the toilet into the garbage bag, one bag, two bags, three bags, and when the last packet of drugs was put in,
0:45:42|0:45:57|He quickly picked up a plastic bag, then stood up and wrapped the bag several times. After putting down the toilet seat cover, he stood on it himself, reached out to move the board on the ceiling, and forcefully stuffed the plastic bag inside.
0:45:59|0:46:15|Then move the board back to its normal position, making everything look like it was back in place. The [Drug Dealer] immediately got off the toilet and wiped the footprints he left on it with his sleeve.
0:46:15|0:46:54|After he pressed the toilet flush, the [Drug Dealer] pulled out a gun from his waist and walked towards the back alley, aiming to shoot. At that time and place, [Xiao An] was discovered. Seeing the innocent [Xiao An], the [Drug Dealer] hesitated to pull the trigger, while [Xiao An] sat obediently against the wall. The scene shifted, ending the flashback. [Drug Dealer] and [Dentist] arrived at the riverside.
0:47:1|0:47:26|The Drug Dealer watched as the Dentist proposed a deal, but the latter ignored him and left on a boat. In the clinic's restroom, the Dentist looked up at the ceiling, then slowly stood on the toilet seat. With a strong push, he poked open the ceiling panel and began to move it bit by bit.
0:47:27|0:47:43|At night, outside the first floor of the mall, [Dentist] sneaked out with something in his arms. The corridor outside was quite long, so he jogged a few steps. After passing through one of the corridors, he quickened his pace.
0:47:45|0:48:10|Suddenly a beam of light shone on his face, illuminating his entire front, and [Dentist] was handcuffed and escorted to the middle-aged police officer. By the riverside at night, [Xiao An] was wearing the clothes of the [Drug Dealer] and gazing into the distance with him.
0:48:12|0:48:41|The Drug Dealer cracked an egg into the frying pan, looking over at Xiao An sitting at the dining table. He winked at her, then turned back to the frying pan. Letting out a heavy sigh, the Drug Dealer sat down at the table. Xiao An was gulping down porridge, glancing to her left at the Drug Dealer.
0:50:22|0:50:34|Pulling down a thick towel and walking into the corridor, [Drug Dealer] wraps the towel around his right hand as he walks. After the driver of [Drug Dealer] comes down the base stairs, he sits on the stairs and puts on his shoes, while the monks continue chanting, not much different from usual.
0:50:34|0:51:0|The door opened, [Drug Dealer] entered the godson's room, the latter was sleeping under the blanket. Outside the villa, the little henchmen were gathering towards the base room. [Drug Dealer] approached the godson and watched as the latter woke up groggily and raised his right hand. On the other side, all the little henchmen entered the base room. [Drug Dealer]'s men locked the door and killed the guard, while [Drug Dealer] shot the godson in the forehead, causing him to lie on the bed face up.
0:51:2|0:51:19|Both father and son died like this. The [Drug Dealer] held a funeral for them in the temple. During the funeral, the [Drug Dealer] knelt devoutly between the portraits of the two, clasped his hands together and knocked his head. After the final knock, he did not bow again, but stared straight ahead.
0:51:19|0:51:25|With the sound of gunfire, the [Drug Dealer] fell to his knees, and then a monk hung an amulet around his neck.
0:51:42|0:52:13|The chanting by the monk has ended, marking the moment when [Drug Dealer] officially becomes the boss. Meanwhile, the driver of [Drug Dealer] is carrying a submachine gun through the base. After becoming the boss, [Drug Dealer] kowtows to the Buddha in the temple. Inside the base, the henchmen of the father and son are lying crookedly on the table, on the floor, and under the wooden room, where blood is dripping like thick porridge from the cracks. The day breaks.
0:52:13|0:52:48|The wind blew through the branches of the base, making a rustling sound. The driver drove to the temple to pick up the [Drug Dealer]. After sleeping for a while in the car, he opened his eyes. From then on, [Xiao An] and the [Drug Dealer] officially lived together. Time passed, [Xiao An] grew up and became the wife of the [Drug Dealer]. The two walked out of the room hand in hand. The scene shifted back to the bridge by the river where it all began.
0:52:50|0:52:57|While Xiao An was staring at the river, the voice of the Dentist came from off-screen.
0:52:57|0:53:24|The person they initially went to see was the [Dentist], who was finally being released from prison. At this moment, [Xiao An] had her hands folded in front of her, she turned around and looked towards the driver's seat of the car standing behind her to the right. She slowly lowered her head, while inside the car, the [Drug Dealer] sat in the driver's seat staring quietly ahead, ignoring [Xiao An]'s gaze. The scene then returned to the father and daughter arguing.
0:53:24|0:53:35|The Dentist stood in the cabin and reminisced, while Xiao An sat on a chair and looked towards her father, saying,
0:54:22|0:55:4|After saying that, [Xiao An] no longer looked towards her father. Upon hearing these words, her father immediately turned his head towards [Xiao An] and paused for a moment before saying, [Xiao An], with tears in her eyes, looked at her father, pursed her lips, lowered her head, and then slowly gazed into the distance. She pleaded softly to her father, [Xiao An], trembling, with her dry lips and furrowed brows, stared straight ahead and suggested to her father:
0:55:5|0:55:11|The screen goes black, and the film transitions to Chapter Three: Daughter. In a small school in Myanmar, [Xiao An] sits beside a piano.
0:55:16|0:55:55|[Xiao An] played the piano while watching the children below, with a slight smile on her lips from time to time. Back at home in the bathroom, [Xiao An] held a pregnancy test in her hand, with two lines indicating that she was going to be a mother. However, she didn't seem too happy about it. On the other side, the drug manufacturer wearing a mask separated the drugs with a sieve, carefully shaking them into the weighing pan. After picking up a large bag of drugs,
0:55:55|0:56:9|The [Drug Dealer] used scissors to cut open, sprinkled into the tray, then extended his index finger to cut a slit with a knife, and fresh blood immediately gushed out. After it gushed out, he hung the wound over the tray, letting the blood drip into it.
0:56:44|0:57:8|Suddenly, a side of the classroom collapsed, with the doors and windows falling to the ground. The air was filled with choking dust from the collapsed building. Half of the classroom collapsed, and [Xiao An], with a cut on her left forehead, crawled out from the crevice. Upon hearing cries for help, she pulled a child out from under a desk and quickly ran to the side, shouting, "Don't panic, don't be afraid."
0:57:12|0:57:21|After picking up a little girl from the ground, [Xiao An] ran out with another child. Not long after they ran, the remaining houses all collapsed.
0:57:28|0:57:42|The doctor told [Xiao An], who had a broken foot, that there was no life-threatening danger and asked her not to worry. After urging the doctor to attend to his other patients, she hopped on her small motorcycle, dragging the crutch given by the doctor, and hurriedly left the hospital. As the motorcycle accelerated forward, [Xiao An], with her left hand already bandaged, kept twisting the throttle.
0:57:44|0:57:51|Listening to Xiao An's accusations, the Drug Dealer came to the hospital and looked thoughtfully at the child on the sickbed.
0:57:52|0:57:56|Some of them had their entire heads wrapped up, while others were still hooked up to IV drips.
0:58:2|0:58:14|Outside the door, upon hearing the doctor's words, the [Drug Dealer] quickly turned to look at him, then glanced back at the children on the sickbed. The [Drug Dealer] asked where the parents of the children were, and they replied that they were on their way.
0:58:15|0:58:46|Upon hearing this, the [Drug Dealer] lowered his head to look at the ground, then took a deep breath and asked if there was any help needed. The [Dentist] replied that drugs were needed. Immediately, he turned and walked towards the car parked outside, ordering his men waiting there to go to China to buy drugs. Afterwards, the [Drug Dealer] quickly bypassed the front of the car and got in. The car drove through dense trees, the glass reflecting light, making it hard to see the [Drug Dealer]'s expression. He forgot how much money he had spent on building the house.
0:58:52|0:59:4|[Drug Dealer] asked again how much was used, the latter still refused to say, [Drug Dealer] pulled out a gun and asked again, the latter answered fifty thousand, [Drug Dealer] asked again, the latter said less than thirty thousand.
0:59:4|0:59:23|[Drug Dealer] grabbed the opponent's short hair with his irritable hands, pulled his collar, and punched his stomach fiercely. [Drug Dealer] fired four shots, each shot piercing from his stomach to his back. Back in the car, [Drug Dealer]'s expression could finally be seen clearly this time.
0:59:24|0:59:44|In the car, every time the car swayed due to the road, [Drug Dealer] squinted his eyes. After four shots pierced the man in the cover, [Drug Dealer] looked at the completely collapsed classroom, then lowered his head to look at the wound on his index finger that had been cut earlier, and pinched the band-aid on it.
1:0:39|1:0:43|The driver looked at the [Drug Dealer] leaning against the front of the car and said indifferently,
1:0:44|1:1:8|The Drug Dealer glanced back and the driver next to him, who was eating an apple, blinked, then turned back to look towards the classroom, tightly closed his lips, not saying a word. But he had made up his mind. The scene shifted to the Mengxiu Station where the Gangster hitman was waiting. After the Drug Dealer's driver put down his own box, he picked up the hitman's box and walked away.
1:1:10|1:1:25|The driver stopped, without looking back, said: After speaking, he continued to carry the box forward. The driver squinted his eyes and did not answer. The scene switched, the driver was on the phone, turned back and gestured to the other party not to wait.
1:1:29|1:1:43|In the daytime, a car was driving unsteadily through the woods, with a man and a woman lying on the back of the convertible. Two henchmen were pointing submachine guns at them.
1:1:43|1:2:2|In the front seat of the car is the driver of the [Drug Dealer], he is driving while occasionally looking back. The [Drug Dealer] is in a waist-deep pit, using a shovel to dig up soil. Beside the pit are henchmen pointing guns at him and [Xiao An] with her hands tied behind her back.
1:2:2|1:2:33|Seeing the new boss approaching the pit, the [Drug Dealer] dropped the shovel, blinked his swollen eyes, and begged for mercy for [Xiao An]. After glancing at [Xiao An], the [Drug Dealer] slowly knelt in the pit, then pleaded with the new boss again. Upon hearing the order to come up, the [Drug Dealer] prepared to climb up by holding onto the edge of the pit. Just as he touched the edge, the new boss kicked him back into the pit, and the [Drug Dealer] turned around once more.
1:2:36|1:2:49|[Xiao An] saw it and knelt by the pit, looking at [Drug Dealer] with heartache. [Drug Dealer] didn't give up, stood up at the bottom of the pit, turned around with difficulty, and there was still long blood left on his head and in his nostrils.
1:2:49|1:2:56|Facing the new boss once again, the [Drug Dealer] clung to his trouser leg, still begging him to spare [Xiao An].
1:2:58|1:3:12|The driver looked down at the [Drug Dealer] beside him, who once again clung to the new boss's leg begging for mercy. Seeing the Drug Dealer's persistence, the driver stepped forward and kicked his head hard. The Drug Dealer still tried to crawl forward, but in the end, he ran out of strength and fell backwards.
1:3:12|1:3:28|Seeing the [Drug Dealer] like this, [Xiao An] shed tears, then staggered to her feet. She took a deep breath, took a few steps forward, and then squatted down and jumped into the pit.
1:3:28|1:3:38|She looked down at the Drug Dealer, Xiao An turned to the new boss and said, then quickly lay down on the left side of the Drug Dealer, resting her head on his shoulder.
1:3:39|1:3:47|At this moment, the driver picked up a shovel and, with both eyes tightly closed, began to throw soil into the pit, shovel by shovel.
1:3:52|1:4:24|Earth was thrown from four directions, gradually covering the chests, waists, and faces of the couple, burying them alive. Coincidentally, the female student who had previously given apples to the [Drug Dealer] witnessed this scene. She quietly ran back home, where an elderly person was preparing herbal medicine, accompanied by the prayers of the hostess. The couple, with their eyes tightly closed, were placed on the ground.
1:4:24|1:4:34|The old man kept stirring the medicine, while the woman kept praying loudly, hoping that this kind-hearted couple could recover.
1:4:34|1:4:42|The female student sat cross-legged next to them, with her hands clasped together, hoping they were unharmed.
1:4:42|1:4:53|In the early morning by the river, the boatman is anxiously waiting. When he sees a few people coming to the river bank, he quickly runs towards his small boat and starts the engine.
1:4:53|1:5:26|The drug dealer touched the student's head as the couple and the student's family came up the river bank. He helped Xiao An onto the small boat, and as the engine's sound faded, the three on the boat sailed towards the other side under the cover of night. After getting off the boat, Xiao An and the drug dealer arrived at her father's house and knocked on the door. When her father opened the door and saw Xiao An, he then noticed the drug dealer behind her.
1:5:26|1:5:51|After being seen by her father dressed shabbily with the [Drug Dealer], [Xiao An] lowered her head. Her father took a step back, half turned around, blinked, slowly turned the other half of his body, leaned against the door frame at an angle, indicating his approval. [Xiao An] quickly looked at the [Drug Dealer], who immediately pulled her inside.
1:5:51|1:5:57|Soon after, [Xiao An]’s father also followed in and closed the door.
1:5:57|1:6:1|Now we come to the fourth chapter of the film: Past Events.
1:6:1|1:6:27|In a dimly lit room, a man in a tank top sits at a table by the window eating. After a while, he picks up a beer from the table and takes a sip. Suddenly, the phone rings.
1:6:32|1:7:5|He walked towards the vibrating phone with a beer cup in his hand, only to find out it was the [Gangster] hitman calling. The [Drug Dealer] shouted at the hitman on the phone, and the hitman raised the phone to answer: After the [Drug Dealer] finished speaking, he hung up the phone. [Xiao An] stared straight at him in the living room. [Drug Dealer] remained silent, just standing there. On the other end, after the call was hung up, the hitman also quietly looked at the phone in his hand.
1:7:6|1:7:37|At this point, we are back to the beginning when the little dog Fifi and [Policewoman Sister] first appeared, one person and one dog, slowly walking towards home from the corridor. Then it was Fifi staring at the next door in the bathroom, followed by [Policewoman Sister] and the police brother arguing before going home. Finally, [Policewoman Sister] with both hands tied to a water pipe, her face wrapped in plastic wrap, struggling frantically in the hitman's bathroom.
1:7:38|1:7:53|Due to difficulty in breathing, [Policewoman Sister] retched, then she shook her head from side to side and moved her body up and down, hoping to get out of the current situation. However, it was just too difficult. Unable to bear it, [Policewoman Sister] cried.
1:7:54|1:8:21|At this moment, the police brother walked out of the house of [Policewoman Sister] holding a cellphone, while the assassin in the bathroom watched [Policewoman Sister] struggle. Outside the door, the brother saw through the open window of the assassin's house the round head cover he had found, looked around and then extended his index and middle fingers to retrieve a round head cover from the window. In the process of taking it out, he accidentally knocked over something else, catching the attention of the assassin.
1:8:23|1:8:52|The killer held his breath, tiptoed out of the bathroom, crossed the corridor, and peeked his head out. Seeing the fallen condom from the window inside the room, he immediately realized someone was outside the door. The killer looked towards the window and turned off the light. Outside the door, the brother saw the light go out, turned his head to look into the window, and the killer immediately stepped back. Suddenly, the brother noticed something on the ceiling outside the door.
1:8:52|1:9:24|Only the top of the killer's house had a light on, while the lights in other houses were off. Then, the brother had a rough plan in mind. Inside the house, the killer slowly moved backwards and pulled out a gun from behind his waist. Outside, the brother carefully approached the killer's door through the window. However, just one step away from the door, he stopped and drew his gun.
1:9:25|1:9:31|He then kicked off his leather shoes, stood with both feet on the ground, and slowly bent down at the waist.
1:9:45|1:10:15|The killer saw the Drug Dealer lying on the ground through the peephole in the door after the Drug Dealer had placed his shoes in front of the door. Then the killer turned back into the room, picked up two boxes, walked to the door, and opened it. As the door opened, he saw the two shoes on the ground and the Drug Dealer leaning against the right side of the door, aiming at the killer's temple. The Drug Dealer quickly ran into the bathroom.
1:10:16|1:10:30|Seeing [Policewoman Sister] wrapped in plastic wrap, her brother immediately knelt down and tore them open one by one. [Policewoman Sister] lay on the ground, finally able to breathe freely, and cried out in frustration.
1:10:30|1:10:46|After tearing off the plastic wrap, the brother worked hard to untie the rope in the hands of [Policewoman Sister] above the water pipe, and then the siblings slowly embraced each other.
1:10:48|1:10:57|In the interrogation room of the [Policewoman Sister] Bureau, the killer and the brother sat facing each other, one on the left and one on the right.
1:11:2|1:11:15|Later, the brother pushed the phone in front of the killer, who picked it up and pressed a few buttons. The [Drug Dealer] asked:
1:11:34|1:12:1|The [Drug Dealer] held up his phone in the living room and answered, then hung up the phone. In the interrogation room, two people sat face to face staring at each other without speaking. Meanwhile, in the rehearsal hall of the choir, [Policewoman Sister] was lying on the ground looking under the stage, then stood up and clapped her hands, ready to pull apart one of the stages.
1:12:4|1:12:20|The door of the rehearsal room suddenly opened, and the [Policewoman Sister] walked in. She glanced at it and was about to continue moving the stage. With a little effort, she stepped up and looked down. [Policewoman Sister] said sadly:
1:12:31|1:12:37|Saying that, the [Policewoman Sister] casually opened a stage and stood on it, looking through the gap.
1:12:40|1:12:48|Moving back to the original position after not finding anything, continuing to pull down the next stage, here is [Policewoman Sister] saying:
1:12:53|1:13:34|After moving the stage back to its original position, the brother stepped on it and walked around. He stared at the ground, took a step back, opened the stage, picked up something from the ground, and threw it into the hands of [Policewoman Sister]. She looked up at him and smiled, then lowered her head and asked, looking at his hand with a sideways glance.
1:13:37|1:13:56|After the brother put the stage back in place and prepared to leave, [Policewoman Sister] called out to him as he was about to walk away. After speaking, [Policewoman Sister] no longer looked directly at her brother, but instead twiddled her fingers, waiting for his answer. The brother walked over and sat down beside her.
1:14:58|1:15:38|Upon hearing this, [Policewoman Sister] turned her head back again. She sighed self-deprecatingly, and when her brother heard it, he turned his head to look at her again. Sensing her brother's gaze, [Policewoman Sister] also turned to look at him, then lowered her head. Her brother tilted his head, took a deep breath, and after speaking, he chuckled softly. Hearing the laughter, [Policewoman Sister] glanced at him and also smiled, then said,
1:15:39|1:15:56|Brother stood up with his hands on his thighs and quickly left. [Policewoman Sister] watched as the siblings met for the first time without arguing, pouted and cried softly. The lights were bright on the airport runway, and brother arrived at his business trip destination.
1:16:25|1:16:52|[The Policewoman Sister] raised her glass to her brother and toasted to him. Her brother was lying in the clinic, and when he heard the Dentist's request, he sat up. After rinsing his mouth, he wiped his mouth and turned to ask, "The Dentist" replied with a turn of his head, washing his hands.
1:17:4|1:17:11|The Dentist stopped washing his hands, turned around to look at his brother, who was sitting in the clinic staring straight at him.
1:17:12|1:17:20|In a restaurant, a hitman is eating noodles. Across from him, his brother also has a bowl of noodles.
1:17:21|1:17:35|The older brother just watched as the killer wolfed down his food without picking up his chopsticks. The killer glanced at him and said, "Brother," as he looked at the killer chewing on noodles, then turned to his colleagues at the other table.
1:17:39|1:18:15|At night, the killer in handcuffs in the prison dialed the phone and said, "When I heard the words 'noodle shop', [Drug Dealer] instantly widened his eyes, recalling his experience from over a decade ago. Then he spoke: "After listening, the killer put down the phone from his ear, hung up, and handed it to his brother."
1:18:17|1:18:35|The latter sighed and the [Drug Dealer] on the other side of the living room also gasped and stared at the phone for a long time after hanging up. The next day in front of Mengxiu Station, the brother looked around the surroundings and then walked out of an old two-story building.
1:18:37|1:18:54|After walking down the short slope, he turned to the right of the old building and found a door locked with iron bars. He shook it hard, and the bars opened halfway. Then he pushed open the other half with force and slowly walked in.
1:18:54|1:19:22|He walked inside while surveying the rundown house, stopped and turned around in place, then noticed a door panel welded onto the window. Opening the panel, sunlight streamed in, revealing potatoes in a package on the floor. The scene shifted to the earlier conversation between the brother and the Dentist at the clinic, where they identified each other.
1:19:22|1:19:45|Without saying a word, on the other side, in the bedroom, the [Drug Dealer] and [Xiao An] sat side by side. The [Dentist] sat with his legs together and hands on his knees, staring blankly at the floor after his brother left. In the bedroom, as the [Drug Dealer] got up from the chair to leave, seeing him preparing to go out, [Xiao An], who was originally sitting beside him, spoke up:
