0:0:30|0:0:40|The movie starts with a concert of Zheng Lucheng's works in Beijing in 2002, where a group of children holding colorful balloons sing Mr. Zheng Lucheng's songs together.
0:2:32|0:2:46|As the song ends, we are taken back to the 1920s, where a young Zheng Lucheng stands on the riverbank playing the violin, while his friends quietly admire around him. The scenery in the distance is beautiful and pleasant.
0:2:46|0:2:51|But at that moment, a plane flew overhead and the children all looked up at the sky.
0:2:54|0:3:7|Just as everyone was still in doubt, the missile under the plane's head had already landed on the river bank. Sensing the danger, the children scattered and fled, while the young [Zheng Lucheng] was already clutching his violin and running frantically.
0:3:7|0:3:11|He ran all the way back home, narrowly escaping danger.
0:3:11|0:3:15|This is Yangnyeong Town, Gwangju City, South Jeolla Province, located in the southern part of the Korean Peninsula.
0:3:17|0:3:22|In his youth, [Zheng Lucheng] lived in this small village with his parents.
0:3:22|0:3:33|He returned to the village safely and first sneaked into Dr. An's house, wanting to return the violin while Dr. An was asleep, to prevent being caught for taking the violin secretly.
0:3:33|0:3:38|[Zheng Lucheng] observed for a while, then carefully placed the qin back in its original position.
0:3:38|0:3:43|As he was about to turn and leave, he never expected to startle [Dr. An] after all.
0:3:44|0:3:49|Being shouted at by Dr. Anbo, [Zheng Lucheng] felt as if he had been frozen in place, unable to move.
0:3:49|0:3:56|Dr. An glanced at Zheng Lucheng standing at the door, then lazily stretched and slowly sat up.
0:3:56|0:3:59|After regaining a bit of clarity, he said.
0:3:59|0:4:1|Upon hearing his name, [Zheng Lucheng] felt a shiver down his spine.
0:4:5|0:4:24|Zheng Lucheng stood still, realizing he couldn't deceive this time. He slowly turned around in a posture of admitting his mistake, facing the doctor's reprimand. Seeing Lucheng's good attitude in admitting his mistake, Old Monitor could only sigh deeply. He stood up slowly, picked up the violin placed on the table.
0:4:38|0:4:41|[Zheng Lucheng], listen, lift up your head.
0:4:43|0:4:48|Dr. An sighed upon hearing this, pacing back and forth in the room.
0:4:48|0:4:50|After a moment of contemplation, he spoke.
0:4:57|0:5:1|Dr. An heard determination and resolve in Lucheng's response from Green City.
0:5:1|0:5:5|He also made up his mind to teach this child well.
0:5:12|0:5:17|[Zheng Lucheng] listened and ran forward excitedly to kneel down and pay respects to the master.
0:5:17|0:5:21|After paying respects to his master, he left Dr. [An]â€™s residence in high spirits.
0:5:21|0:5:28|At this moment, Zheng Lucheng's mother is at home, holding a wooden stick and continuously beating the clothes.
0:5:31|0:5:33|He ran over and knelt beside his mother.
0:5:37|0:5:43|The mother did not stop her hands from moving.
0:5:43|0:5:57|Hearing Lucheng's coquettishness, his mother turned her head and lovingly touched his face.
0:5:57|0:6:0|In the evening, the family sat around eating together.
0:6:5|0:6:9|The mother brought the steamed food from the pot to the dining table.
0:7:34|0:7:39|His father's scolding did not extinguish Zheng Lucheng's enthusiasm for learning.
0:7:39|0:7:43|The next day, he came to study at Dr. [An]'s house as scheduled.
0:7:43|0:7:48|And as he diligently studied, the Japanese military police gradually infiltrated the village.
0:7:48|0:7:53|The Japanese soldiers marched with deafening footsteps, swearing to destroy and trample on peace.
0:7:55|0:8:0|And at this moment, [Zheng Lucheng] was completely unaware of the impending danger.
0:8:0|0:8:8|Suddenly, a young villager rushed over to find [Zheng Lucheng] in a fluster.
0:8:8|0:8:13|Upon hearing the bad news, [Zheng Lucheng] immediately rushed home, with [Dr. An] following closely behind.
0:8:13|0:8:16|At this moment, the Japanese military police broke in and stormed into the home of [Zheng Lucheng].
0:8:35|0:8:38|At this moment, [Zheng Lucheng] is rushing home along the way.
0:8:38|0:8:43|After coming to his senses, Zheng Lucheng quickly caught up with the Japanese soldiers taking away his father.
0:8:43|0:8:47|In a moment of desperation, he picked up a stick from the corner of the wall, ready to fight the Japanese invaders with all his might.
0:8:55|0:8:59|But to their surprise, they had not taken a few steps before being stopped by a Japanese officer standing nearby.
0:8:59|0:9:7|A Japanese officer pointed a gun at Zheng Lucheng's head, staring at him fiercely, while his sister looked on in shock.
0:9:11|0:9:15|At home, [Zheng Lucheng] died under the gun of a military officer.
0:9:18|0:9:22|The mother heard gunshots and went back to check on Zheng Lucheng.
0:9:22|0:9:27|At this moment, [Zheng Lucheng] arrived late.
0:9:27|0:9:33|He ran over to check on his fallen brother.
0:9:33|0:9:36|Thus, the family lost two people in a row.
0:9:36|0:9:39|The once happy and harmonious family has become fragmented.
0:9:39|0:9:44|The next morning, the family planned to send the children away from the village.
0:10:16|0:10:23|At this moment, [Dr. An] also rushed over.
0:10:23|0:10:30|Dr. An took out his previously cherished violin from his arms, intending to give it to [Zheng Lucheng] as a parting gift.
0:10:30|0:10:38|[Zheng Lucheng] hesitated to accept such a valuable gift at first, but Dr. An was determined and he had no choice but to accept it.
0:10:38|0:10:43|He looked at the teacher who had taught him before, then bowed deeply.
0:10:44|0:10:48|At this moment, everyone was at a loss on how to face their own emotions.
0:10:48|0:10:52|The family has just experienced unbearable hardships, but they can only embrace silence.
0:10:54|0:10:59|And this humiliation and hatred planted a seed in the heart of young [Zheng Lucheng].
0:10:59|0:11:4|And so, [Zheng Lucheng] left the village with his sister, embarking on a journey.
0:11:4|0:11:13|With each step they took, they couldn't help but look back at the beloved hometown they were leaving behind, until the scenery disappeared from view.
0:11:14|0:11:19|Dr. An and the mother stayed behind, watching the children leave.
0:11:19|0:11:22|The journey of the two is destined to be full of uncertainties and challenges.
0:11:22|0:11:26|The journey left hometown and arrived in China.
0:11:56|0:12:6|The atrocities of the Japanese spread continuously on this land of China, and everyone is struggling to survive in this turbulent era, including [Zheng Lucheng].
0:12:10|0:12:16|[Zheng Lucheng] stood on the platform playing the violin for the students participating in the student movement.
0:12:16|0:12:21|The crowd was all inspired by the melodious music and started singing patriotic songs.
0:12:21|0:12:26|In the crowd stands a strange woman, looking at [Zheng Lucheng] playing with a face of satisfaction.
0:12:29|0:12:34|And at that moment, she also noticed the malicious gaze behind her.
0:12:34|0:12:45|Not far away, several suspicious individuals were watching the situation at the scene. The woman, who sensed the danger, looked worriedly at [Zheng Lucheng] standing on the stage.
0:12:45|0:12:53|And at this moment, [Zheng Lucheng] was completely immersed in his own world of music, ever since he left the village, he has been wandering outside.
0:12:55|0:12:59|Accompanied by the sound of the qin, his homesickness surged.
0:12:59|0:13:7|He recalled the kindness of Dr. An who taught him and gave him this guitar, a favor he would never forget in his life.
0:13:7|0:13:16|It is the mother who stays at home and the sister who shares the hardships with him that have supported him all the way.
0:13:16|0:13:24|After coming to China, he also experienced a lot of political turmoil, participating in various student movements during his youth.
0:13:24|0:13:31|In this critical moment of saving the nation, he chose to join the army of the party in resistance, contributing his effort for the country.
0:13:31|0:13:35|At the same time, it is also to seek revenge on the Japanese who harmed his family back then.
0:13:36|0:13:44|At night, [Zheng Lucheng] finished his day's activities and was about to go home, but three people suddenly blocked his way.
0:13:44|0:13:49|[Zheng Lucheng] stopped in his tracks, the three of them looked menacing, full of malice.
0:13:49|0:13:58|Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be the person who was monitoring [Zheng Lucheng] at the event during the day.
0:13:58|0:14:1|The three of them stepped forward and started punching and kicking [Zheng Lucheng].
0:14:5|0:14:11|They were just getting into it when they were sternly stopped by someone in the darkness.
0:14:11|0:14:21|During the day, the woman emerged from the shadows.
0:14:21|0:14:23|The woman and the coachman pulled out their guns and aimed at the three people.
0:14:28|0:14:31|The three of them saw each other with guns and fled in panic.
0:14:31|0:14:35|The woman caught up and checked on the fallen Zheng Lucheng.
0:14:35|0:14:42|It looks like she is seriously injured. She and the coachman lifted [Zheng Lucheng] onto the carriage and took him to her own residence for the time being.
0:14:42|0:14:46|The woman lives in a well-decorated Western-style house.
0:14:46|0:14:49|She patiently tended to the wound of the fainting Zheng Lucheng.
0:14:49|0:14:53|Intense pain woke [Zheng Lucheng] up from fainting.
0:14:53|0:14:56|But even when injured like this, the first thing she thought of was her own qin.
0:15:3|0:15:5|He quickly got up to check his own qin.
0:15:5|0:15:8|[Zheng Lucheng] has a blue face.
0:15:29|0:15:33|He reached out to his violin, lost in thought.
0:15:33|0:15:36|Upon hearing the news from his elder sister, [Zheng Lucheng] quickly approached in excitement to inquire further.
0:16:5|0:16:11|Upon hearing this question, the woman fell silent, as she had not yet figured out how to tell Zheng Lucheng about this matter.
0:16:11|0:16:15|Hesitating, she turned and walked away, her back facing [Zheng Lucheng].
0:16:15|0:16:17|After a moment of worry, she spoke up.
0:16:25|0:16:31|Upon receiving the bad news, [Zheng Lucheng] couldn't believe it for a moment, and exclaimed in astonishment.
0:16:31|0:16:35|The words shattered his thoughts like a bolt from the blue.
0:16:35|0:16:44|Mu Lan took out an object carefully wrapped in a handkerchief from the drawer of the table, turned around, and handed it to the still shocked Zheng Lucheng.
0:16:44|0:16:48|He sat down and gradually digested this pain.
0:16:53|0:16:57|Wrapped carefully is a silver bracelet.
0:16:57|0:17:0|Zheng Lucheng walked slowly over and carefully inspected.
0:17:1|0:17:4|A wave of sadness swept over the heart.
0:17:5|0:17:7|He couldn't control his emotions for a moment.
0:17:8|0:17:10|Facing this situation, [Mu Lan] spoke up.
0:17:27|0:17:32|And Zheng Lucheng, unable to suppress his anger, finally stood up and was about to leave.
0:17:53|0:17:55|Mu Lan stepped forward to stop him.
0:17:56|0:18:0|Faced with the determination of [Mu Lan], he gradually calmed down.
0:18:13|0:18:15|Life gradually became peaceful.
0:18:28|0:18:31|The crackling of the phonograph interrupted their conversation.
0:18:31|0:18:40|Mu Lan stepped forward to adjust the phonograph, remaining silent in response to Zheng Lucheng's question.
0:19:6|0:19:9|Mu Lan helped him tidy up and smiled satisfactorily.
0:19:9|0:19:12|He changed into his clothes and arrived at a Western-style house in a decent manner.
0:19:12|0:19:18|He first looked around, made sure no one was following, then turned and walked in.
0:19:18|0:19:23|His experience in participating in patriotic activities and student movements has made him very cautious in everything.
0:19:23|0:19:26|At this moment, he had already developed the consciousness of a revolutionary.
0:19:26|0:19:33|Upon arriving at the location, he confirmed it was correct and then knocked on the door.
0:19:40|0:19:43|He took out the documents that could prove himself from the pocket of his coat.
0:19:43|0:19:48|At night, [Mu Lan] was reading a newspaper at home when someone knocked on the door.
0:19:48|0:19:54|Mu Lan puts down the newspaper, stands up, and opens the door to check.
0:19:54|0:19:57|Zheng Lucheng walked in after opening the door.
0:19:57|0:19:59|He hung up his hat and took off his coat after entering the room.
0:21:54|0:21:58|They became comrades in the revolutionary journey.
0:21:58|0:21:59|Not long after.
0:22:5|0:22:12|The two of them walked together on the long road, heading towards the sacred place in their hearts.
0:22:12|0:22:19|They stopped in their tracks and gazed at the scenery before them.
0:22:19|0:22:21|This is the Yellow River bank, Yan'an.
0:22:29|0:22:50|The two stood dumbfounded, staring at the scene before them. Everywhere they looked, there were well-trained Eighth Route Army troops, on the hillside, in the fields, within the courtyard, all actively engaged in production work. They moved with tension and continuity, working seriously and energetically, each person performing their duties and cooperating with each other.
0:22:51|0:22:58|The scene before him shocked newcomer [Zheng Lucheng] particularly. He secretly made up his mind to make a career here.
0:22:58|0:23:2|Zheng Lucheng and Ding Xuesong had just arrived in Yan'an and happened to pass by the choir rehearsing.
0:23:3|0:23:7|Suddenly, [Zheng Lucheng] seemed to have sensed something and stood still in place.
0:23:7|0:23:15|After the grand chorus, the girls from the choir brought out a bouquet of flowers.
0:23:18|0:23:25|[Zheng Lucheng] suddenly realized that this person was his childhood mentor.
0:23:25|0:23:26|The two of them embraced each other excitedly.
0:23:37|0:23:42|They had been separated for many years, but never expected to meet again here.
0:23:42|0:23:45|Finally, they returned to their accommodation to rest and recuperate.
0:24:8|0:24:13|Lao Zhang turned around and sat down, picking up the microphone next to him and asked.
0:24:49|0:24:53|The two of them talked happily and agreed to collaborate in the future.
0:24:53|0:25:0|[Mu Lan] has become busy since arriving in Yan'an, throwing herself tirelessly into her revolutionary tasks.
0:25:0|0:25:4|At this moment, [Zheng Lucheng] talked about the past with the long-lost [Dr. An].
0:25:15|0:25:19|Dr. Anbo sighed deeply after listening, shaking his head at the dark world of the Forbidden City.
0:25:46|0:25:47|At this moment, the [Old Monitor] on the side also joined the conversation.
0:26:35|0:26:37|After listening to these words, [Zheng Lucheng] fell into contemplation.
0:27:1|0:27:5|This is the real great poet, from the Yan'an Lu Xun Academy of Arts, [Mu Lan].
0:27:21|0:27:27|[Old Monitor] is a lover of revelry, he is not drunk but everyone else is, a lone hero in toasting and exchanging cups.
0:27:29|0:27:30|The group of people sat around in a circle.
0:28:18|0:28:26|Mentioning Mu Lan, everyone's faces instantly darkened, and Zheng Lucheng, unaware of the matter, asked in confusion.
0:28:26|0:28:33|After much consideration, everyone decided to tell him the truth, [Mu Lan]'s husband, Comrade Yang Wu.
0:28:41|0:28:47|[Zheng Lucheng] was quite shocked by this, and [Mu Lan] treated him generously, serving as a guide in his revolutionary career.
0:28:47|0:28:51|And this time, Mu Lan's injury deepened his hatred towards the Japanese even more.
0:28:53|0:29:6|He got up and left the crowd, went out the door, and searched around for Mu Lan's figure. At this time, Mu Lan was sitting on a secluded hillside, digesting this pain alone.
0:29:6|0:29:10|After searching everywhere, Zheng Lucheng finally found Mu Lan on the hillside.
0:29:12|0:29:16|Mu Lan heard someone calling her, and only then did she awaken from her sorrowful emotions.
0:29:16|0:29:21|She wiped away the tears on her face and tidied up her haggard appearance a little.
0:29:21|0:29:27|[Zheng Lucheng] sat down behind her, wanting to comfort her, but not knowing how to start.
0:29:36|0:29:44|Mu Lan, upon hearing these words, although the lingering sadness was hard to dispel, her tightly furrowed brows gradually relaxed.
0:29:58|0:30:1|Mu Lan at this moment recalled the heroic deeds of her husband.
0:30:9|0:30:14|She sacrificed herself for the revolutionary cause of all people, a true hero.
0:30:14|0:30:23|Mu Lan's emotions of sadness and pride are intertwined, leaving her with mixed feelings.
0:30:23|0:30:24|She lowered her head and smiled with relief.
0:30:28|0:30:37|The honorable sacrifice of her husband has made [Mu Lan] even more determined to dedicate herself to the revolutionary cause.
0:30:37|0:30:49|Zheng Lucheng was deeply moved after hearing about Mu Lan's husband's heroic deeds. Her sacrifice inspired more people to join the revolutionary cause.
0:30:49|0:30:55|Despite this, [Mu Lan] still found it hard to accept her husband's departure. Overwhelmed with emotions, she began to cry uncontrollably.
0:30:59|0:31:7|Zheng Lucheng looked at the crying Mu Lan, not knowing what to do, and could only sit behind her silently sharing the pain of losing her loved one.
0:31:7|0:31:12|She turned her head and looked into the distance, the flames of revenge burning stronger in her heart.
0:31:15|0:31:19|It wasn't until evening that Zheng Lucheng accompanied Mu Lan back to their residence.
0:31:19|0:31:23|In the room, everyone is still waiting for the two to return.
0:31:28|0:31:40|The crowd expressed deep sympathy for [Mu Lan]'s ordeal.
0:31:40|0:31:49|Mu Lan and Mo Ye embrace each other, while the comrades in Yan'an are constantly remembering the heroes who sacrificed in battle.
0:31:49|0:31:55|Everyone gathered together, comforting the sorrowful and tearful [Mu Lan].
0:32:2|0:32:7|Mo Ye's words made Mu Lan recall her husband's past.
0:32:27|0:32:35|[Mo Ye] turned around and picked up the package that had been prepared on the table, carefully handing it to [Mu Lan].
0:32:38|0:32:41|Mu Lan reached out her hand and took the relic.
0:32:41|0:32:46|Fate is unpredictable, things change, this is the only thing left by her husband.
0:32:46|0:32:51|And this originally light object has now become incredibly heavy.
0:32:51|0:32:53|The next day, [Zheng Lucheng] was watching the female soldiers training.
0:33:5|0:33:9|At this moment, [Old Monitor] and [Dr. An] came over and found [Zheng Lucheng].
0:33:33|0:33:35|Zheng Lucheng looked incredulous.
0:34:29|0:34:33|Since that's the case, [Zheng Lucheng] had no choice but to comply with the arrangement and go on the filming trip.
0:34:33|0:34:41|The female soldiers are rehearsing the performance of Ansai waist drums, their movements are neat and uniform, striking out rapid and rhythmic drum beats.
0:34:41|0:34:49|Accompanied by the changing rhythm of percussion, [Mu Lan]'s movements became more expansive, stepping lightly with enthusiastic and unrestrained dance steps.
0:34:49|0:34:55|The double hammers striking the waist drum, with beautiful tassels flipping up and down, are pleasing to the eye and extremely exciting.
0:34:57|0:35:1|And at this moment, [Zheng Lucheng] and [Dr. An] arrived to observe together.
0:35:1|0:35:5|Seeing such a wonderful performance, he was mesmerized for a moment.
0:35:10|0:35:13|Everyone stopped what they were doing.
0:36:2|0:36:6|Arriving in a new environment, [Zheng Lucheng] plans to make a name for himself here.
0:36:6|0:36:11|In the village, he saw a group of children sitting around singing and playing.
0:36:57|0:37:5|[Zheng Lucheng] constantly visits the village, getting to know the local people and truly integrating with the masses.
0:37:5|0:37:8|At night, [Zheng Lucheng] is working on his creation with a lamp, and [Old Monitor] walks in.
0:37:44|0:37:52|After placing the flowers, [Old Monitor] sat across from [Zheng Lucheng], then he seemed to have discovered something and asked in confusion.
0:38:5|0:38:13|The Old Monitor widened his eyes in surprise and counted on the notebook with his hand.
0:38:26|0:38:28|[Old Monitor] smiled kindly.
0:38:36|0:38:44|The next day in class with the female students, [Zheng Lucheng] was putting up Yan Shuiyao's music score on the blackboard.
0:39:30|0:39:36|After class, the female soldiers walked back to the dormitory together, humming the song they had just learned.
0:39:36|0:39:40|They chatted and laughed along the way, showing respect for youth and art.
0:39:40|0:39:45|When returning to the dormitory to rest, the captain noticed the flowers and novel placed on the table.
0:39:45|0:39:49|The title of this novel is "Miss Tong Bo".
0:39:49|0:39:51|The female soldiers in the same dormitory noticed something strange.
0:40:52|0:40:55|After hearing this, everyone stood up and began to prepare.
0:40:55|0:40:59|The captain also distributed the washed fruits to everyone.
0:40:59|0:41:8|At the bonfire party in the evening, everyone sat around together.
0:41:28|0:41:33|Mr. Xian Xinghai finished his speech, and the audience applauded warmly. Next up is [Zheng Lucheng] to speak.
0:41:44|0:41:50|Amidst the applause, she picked up the violin and walked onto the stage, with the female soldiers below eagerly awaiting [Zheng Lucheng]'s performance.
0:42:21|0:42:30|During the performance by [Zheng Lucheng], he reminisces about his childhood, with the song filled with his longing for his hometown and mother.
0:42:55|0:43:0|If all family members were still alive, then [Zheng Lucheng] would definitely be a happy person.
0:43:0|0:43:8|He would think of his elder brother, elder sister, father, and mother countless times, recalling the warm afternoons when the family sat together.
0:43:57|0:44:4|[Zheng Lucheng]'s wonderful singing and simple emotional expression touched everyone present, and the audience burst into enthusiastic applause.
0:44:7|0:44:12|Even Mr. Xian Xinghai highly praised the performance of [Zheng Lucheng].
0:44:12|0:44:16|After the bonfire party, [Zheng Lucheng] and the female soldiers returned to their accommodation together.
0:44:41|0:44:47|Amidst laughter and chatter, everyone dispersed. Even though it was late at night, Captain [Ding Xuesong] was still studying under the lamplight.
0:45:7|0:45:13|Previously, she found a bookmark in the book, with a drawing of a person playing the violin on it.
0:45:13|0:45:22|[Ding Xuesong] was so engrossed that he didn't notice the female soldier slowly approaching behind him.
0:45:30|0:45:34|The female soldier quickly bent over and leaned close to his ear.
0:45:34|0:45:38|Seeing the captain ignoring her, the female soldier began to disturb him while he was studying.
0:45:38|0:45:43|After a failed attempt at causing trouble, the female soldiers had to give up, leaving [Ding Xuesong] alone to continue reading.
0:45:44|0:46:0|The next day, [Zheng Lucheng] sat on the hillside writing a song, while the female soldiers in the distance worked by the river, laughing and causing her to look up and gaze ahead. Some people in the front were also grooming and wiping horses on the riverbank, creating a scene of joy and laughter.
0:46:2|0:46:14|He turned his head back to the riverbank, where the joyful atmosphere did not slow down the pace of work, but instead allowed everyone to immerse themselves in it, enabling people to truly feel happiness in their labor.
0:46:14|0:46:19|This joyful scene and the enthusiastic labor scene deeply moved [Zheng Lucheng].
0:46:19|0:46:27|With this, he was suddenly inspired, standing up and looking into the distance, this wonderful emotion beginning to brew.
0:46:27|0:46:29|[Zheng Lucheng] went to find Big Sister [Mo Ye].
0:46:58|0:47:4|After speaking, he hurriedly found [Old Monitor].
0:47:4|0:47:8|In the kitchen, he poured firewood for [Old Monitor] and helped with emergency cooking.
0:48:34|0:48:40|[Zheng Lucheng] happily reached a cooperation with others, and then began his intense and sustainable creation.
0:48:40|0:48:45|And this time, the song created by [Zheng Lucheng] is the widely sung "Ode to Yan'an" passed down through generations.
0:48:45|0:48:52|This song was created in 1938, with magnificent and uplifting music composition.
0:48:52|0:48:54|The lyrics are catchy and profound.
0:48:55|0:49:8|In this song, lyricism and combativeness are intertwined, with the author's deep love and praise for the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an, providing great spiritual encouragement to the revolutionary soldiers.
0:49:8|0:49:14|Even the most ordinary people, after hearing it, are deeply moved and cannot forget it for a long time.
0:49:14|0:49:18|This is why this song is so classic and has been passed down to this day.
0:50:19|0:50:27|In a majestic and solemn ancient city,
0:51:37|0:51:49|Chinese subtitle volunteer [Li Zongsheng].
0:52:12|0:52:17|The song finished, igniting the enthusiasm of everyone.
0:52:17|0:52:22|[Zheng Lucheng] solemnly saluted the officials in the audience and completed the curtain call.
0:52:22|0:52:28|The people in the audience all stood up and raised their hands in celebration.
0:52:28|0:52:31|They lifted [Zheng Lucheng] above their heads, repeatedly tossing him into the air.
0:52:33|0:52:39|The crowd at the scene was extremely enthusiastic, and [Zheng Lucheng] became the most beloved person by the audience.
0:52:39|0:52:42|Life returned to normal, [Zheng Lucheng] went to the river to catch fish.
0:53:0|0:53:5|Carrying the fish he just caught, [Zheng Lucheng] coaxed [Ding Xuesong] to go find Xiao Qu.
0:53:5|0:53:10|Just as she reached the entrance, she noticed a group of female soldiers tuning new musical instruments in the courtyard.
0:53:10|0:53:13|After observing for a while, she walked in quickly.
0:53:13|0:53:16|But it took a while for the female soldiers in the courtyard to notice.
0:54:10|0:54:13|The crowd dispersed, leaving only [Zheng Lucheng] and [Ding Xuesong].
0:54:15|0:54:18|After all the female soldiers entered the kitchen, she said.
0:54:20|0:54:24|[Zheng Lucheng] followed suit and the two entered the room to rest.
0:54:25|0:54:30|At this moment, the soldier with a medal on his chest is riding a horse on the road.
0:54:30|0:54:33|He crossed over the high mountain towers and through the bustling sunset city.
0:54:33|0:54:37|Upon arriving home, he excitedly pushed open the door and said, "I'm home."
0:54:37|0:54:41|He is the son of [Old Monitor], returning home to visit him.
0:54:41|0:54:50|After a while, [Old Monitor] walked out of the kitchen with a look of surprise on his face.
0:55:20|0:55:24|After the end, [Zheng Lucheng] went to watch the children perform a play.
0:56:29|0:56:31|During the performance, someone suddenly ran over.
0:56:31|0:56:33|The group received the news and immediately set off.
0:56:40|0:56:45|A group of people rushed into the room in a state of anxiety and saw [Mu Lan], who was covered in injuries.
0:56:46|0:56:48|Everyone gathered around the bed.
0:56:52|0:56:54|Mu Lan is very weak at this moment.
0:57:10|0:57:12|[Zheng Lucheng] nodded with relief.
0:57:41|0:57:43|[Ding Xuesong] took out a stack of papers from [Mu Lan]'s pocket.
0:58:2|0:58:11|Zheng Lucheng carefully pondered the lyrics as if he had found a treasure.
0:58:11|0:58:13|He then hurried to the home of [Old Monitor].
0:58:49|0:58:57|The river flowing down the mountain is no longer water, but blood.
0:58:57|0:59:2|The people at the table lowered their heads upon hearing such a cruel story.
0:59:5|0:59:9|He pursed his lips and continued to speak.
0:59:19|0:59:28|There was a soldier with a bayonet stuck in his back, but he still tightly held onto the throat of the Japanese soldier and didn't let go.
0:59:28|0:59:37|There was another soldier who had both legs blown off by a bomb, but he managed to crawl over and seize the enemy's machine gun.
0:59:37|0:59:46|Behind him, there is a long trail of blood.
1:0:19|1:0:22|At this moment, [Old Monitor] walked in carrying food.
1:0:22|1:0:24|The crowd all turned their heads.
1:0:55|1:0:58|The heavy story made everyone lose their appetite.
1:0:58|1:1:6|The next day, [Zheng Lucheng] was creating in his room, while [Old Monitor] was cooking and dozing off on the side.
1:1:6|1:1:9|Rice is still cooking in the pot, and the house is filled with smoke.
1:1:9|1:1:15|But [Zheng Lucheng] was not affected at all, immersed in his own music.
1:1:47|1:1:49|As soon as the words fell, he hurriedly ran out in a panic.
1:2:19|1:2:21|Zheng Lucheng finds Ding Xuesong.
1:2:31|1:2:40|After the instructions were given, the two of them left together, and [Xiao Douzi] took over to continue the training in place of [Ding Xuesong].
1:2:59|1:3:7|[Ding Xuesong] looked at [Zheng Lucheng] with a puzzled expression.
1:3:7|1:3:14|His gaze softened.
1:3:14|1:3:18|Seeing the clumsy performance of [Zheng Lucheng], he couldn't help but smile and lower his head.
1:3:57|1:3:59|This is the motivational part of the song.
1:4:20|1:4:24|[Zheng Lucheng]'s confusion made [Ding Xuesong] a little nervous.
1:4:42|1:4:45|This conversation dispelled [Ding Xuesong]'s doubts.
1:5:4|1:5:8|Zheng Lucheng shook his head while tearing up the song he had written earlier.
1:5:8|1:5:15|She held the paper crumpled in her hand, showing her disappointment.
1:5:15|1:5:17|[Ding Xuesong] spoke up at this moment.
1:5:59|1:6:5|Then you... [Old Monitor] is sweeping the yard, when his son comes out of the house.
1:6:29|1:6:35|At this moment, [Ding Xuesong] happened to come for a visit.
1:7:55|1:7:58|At this moment, [Ding Xuesong] took out a pair of new shoes from behind and handed them to [Old Monitor].
1:8:5|1:8:8|After speaking, without waiting for [Old Monitor] to react, he ran out the door.
1:8:8|1:8:17|At the same time, [Zheng Lucheng], who was sitting on the hillside contemplating, was dragged down the hill from behind by someone. He looked up and said at the bottom of the slope.
1:8:21|1:8:23|Both Zheng Lucheng and Ding Xuesong were very excited to see each other this time.
1:8:36|1:8:39|[Old Zhang] hesitated for a moment before deciding to pay back first.
1:8:43|1:8:45|[Old Monitor] stood up and walked forward.
1:8:45|1:8:47|Zheng Lucheng then caught up from behind.
1:9:40|1:9:45|As soon as [Zheng Lucheng]'s song started, it spread throughout the barracks and trenches.
1:9:56|1:9:59|The two of them walked a long way together.
1:9:59|1:10:5|Here, [Zheng Lucheng] read the words written by [Old Monitor] with excitement overflowing in his eyes.
1:10:5|1:10:10|They kept discussing composition, lyrics, and the heroic deeds that happened on the battlefield along the way.
1:10:11|1:10:16|And this deep and efficient communication also became the soil on which this song was successfully composed.
1:10:16|1:10:20|In the evening, the long-unseen group of people sat together and started singing songs.
1:10:20|1:10:25|In this scene, [Xian Xinghai] also came out of the house with a cup to join them.
1:11:52|1:11:56|The crowd burst into laughter after hearing it, causing the two to awkwardly lower their heads.
1:11:56|1:12:4|Chen Xinghai modestly shook his head at this and said quietly.
1:12:46|1:12:51|A grand chorus of the Yellow River ignited the anti-Japanese enthusiasm of thousands of Chinese people.
1:13:1|1:13:4|[Chen Xinghai] and [Zheng Lucheng] were walking on the riverbank.
1:14:7|1:14:16|However, you seem to lack a kind of leisurely heart to listen to the sea, said [Zheng Lucheng] earnestly.
1:15:0|1:15:4|Xian Xinghai stopped in his tracks, turned around and looked at [Zheng Lucheng].
1:15:42|1:15:44|[Ding Xuesong] and [Xiao Douzi] are milking sheep in the yard.
1:16:21|1:16:25|Originally, the goat milk was meant to be delivered to the injured Mu Lan on the battlefield.
1:16:25|1:16:30|[Zheng Lucheng] and [Ding Xuesong] came to visit [Mu Lan] together with [Xian Xinghai].
1:18:11|1:18:20|Zheng Lucheng hesitated as he looked at the gun.
1:18:20|1:18:23|With that, he gladly took the gun.
1:18:23|1:18:26|After visiting Mu Lan, the group left the ward.
1:18:33|1:18:44|Xian Xinghai left first, leaving only Ding Xuesong and Zheng Lucheng behind. There were constantly wounded soldiers being brought to this place outside the ward, the situation on the front line was extremely fierce.
1:18:44|1:18:46|They walked and chatted as they strolled.
1:19:43|1:19:47|[Ding Xuesong] heard and became shy.
1:19:47|1:19:50|Yes, but I... This sudden confession made him secretly delighted, and he then decisively asked as if he had made up his mind.
1:20:15|1:20:21|Although the two have long had a mutual affection, this time they finally expressed their feelings.
1:20:21|1:20:23|The two of them, Zheng Lucheng and Mu Lan, have now pledged eternal love to each other, tears welling up in their eyes.
1:20:25|1:20:29|Suddenly, the distant sound of the Gaokao mountain song rang out.
1:20:29|1:20:34|They, who were originally immersed in joy, were attracted by this folk song.
1:20:34|1:20:37|Upon closer inspection, it turns out to be a farmer herding sheep on the mountain.
1:20:37|1:20:43|And at this moment, the two of them seemed to make the same decision tacitly, to get married.
1:20:43|1:20:48|There is no need for communication. They just ran forward holding each other's hands.
1:20:49|1:20:56|Comrades along the coast held a grand wedding for the newlyweds, and every corner of the venue was filled with joy.
1:20:56|1:21:0|In the heated debate, [Old Monitor] stepped forward and addressed the audience below.
1:21:17|1:21:21|First, at this moment, [Xian Xinghai] steps onto the stage to greet everyone.
1:21:40|1:21:46|The atmosphere in the venue was ignited again, and amidst cheers, [Zheng Lucheng] and [Ding Xuesong] walked out slowly.
1:21:46|1:21:53|They accepted the blessings that came their way somewhat awkwardly, but the joy on their faces was hard to conceal.
1:21:53|1:21:56|Even the injured Mu Lan came to bless them.
1:22:22|1:22:24|Two young comrades brought wine to [Zheng Lucheng] and [Ding Xuesong].
1:22:26|1:22:29|They exchanged their wine cups with each other, as a token of friendship.
1:22:42|1:22:49|Knowing the news from [Old Monitor], [Zheng Lucheng] felt relieved. The two of them raised their heads and drank a toast, showing their empty cups to everyone.
1:22:55|1:22:59|They each took out a gift prepared in advance from their own pockets.
1:22:59|1:23:4|[Ding Xuesong] gave a pen to [Zheng Lucheng], while [Zheng Lucheng] gave a bracelet to [Ding Xuesong].
1:23:11|1:23:14|Amidst the enthusiastic cheers from the audience, the show began.
1:23:14|1:23:22|[Dr. An] is in charge of playing the drum, with a whole Chinese orchestra behind him, this lineup is truly luxurious.
1:23:22|1:23:25|[Zheng Lucheng] and [Ding Xuesong] are sitting on the stage, getting ready to watch the performance.
1:23:25|1:23:30|At this moment, three dancers enter the stage, with [Xiao Douzi] leading the dance this time.
1:23:30|1:23:35|They danced the traditional Korean dance, also the dance from [Zheng Lucheng]'s hometown.
1:23:35|1:23:38|Accompanied by melodious music, the three of them danced gracefully and relaxed.
1:23:39|1:23:50|The driving force of the dance always runs through the charm, combining light footsteps with relaxed upper body movements, as natural as breathing.
1:23:50|1:24:3|The overall momentum, sinking and then quickly rising, embodies the beauty of traditional Korean dance with the crane-style arms, lamb-style body, and tiger-style steps.
1:24:3|1:24:6|The emotional expression is so intense that it is breathtaking.
1:24:8|1:24:16|While everyone was celebrating the wedding, [Old Monitor] was still grinding flour in the yard, preparing dinner early for everyone.
1:24:16|1:24:19|The wedding is still ongoing, and people's emotions are gradually reaching a high point.
1:24:21|1:24:26|Comrades in performance and playing are all enjoying themselves, immersed in this cheerful atmosphere.
1:24:26|1:24:32|Almost everyone here has temporarily forgotten what era they are in.
1:24:32|1:24:36|The long period of peaceful life has made everyone accustomed to this rhythm.
1:24:36|1:24:43|With that, they temporarily set aside their personal grudges and focused on the wedding amidst the ongoing war.
1:24:44|1:24:50|In the harsh reality, this brief romance appears particularly precious.
1:24:50|1:24:55|Coincidentally, at this moment, a Japanese fighter plane flew overhead.
1:24:55|1:25:0|The [Old Monitor] in the outer prison seat was the first to spot the plane.
1:25:4|1:25:7|At this moment, everyone attending the wedding also noticed something unusual.
1:25:14|1:25:25|People were awakened from the beautiful illusion at this moment, and Japanese planes began to drop bombs after circling in the sky for a while. The bombs fell like rain on the places where people lived, causing heavy casualties in an instant.
1:25:30|1:25:33|In the chaos, people hurriedly evacuated from the wedding venue.
1:25:33|1:25:38|The common people on the street also scattered and fled, avoiding the enemy planes of the Japanese army.
1:25:38|1:25:43|[Tiedan] hurriedly rushed to the home of [Old Monitor], with everyone following closely behind.
1:25:43|1:25:49|Unfortunately, the [Old Monitor] was affected by the bomb dropped by the Japanese army.
1:25:49|1:25:53|Son [Tiedan] and the hastily arriving crowd were unable to save [Old Monitor].
1:26:13|1:26:24|At this moment, [Old Monitor] had stopped breathing, and everyone's emotions shifted from great joy to deep sorrow in an instant, unable to accept the departure of [Old Monitor].
1:26:24|1:26:36|The grieving crowd surrounded the body of [Old Monitor], crying uncontrollably. Throughout his life, [Old Monitor] was strong-willed, never showing any fear even when facing the bullets of the Japanese invaders. He walked through his life as a revolutionary with honor.
1:26:37|1:26:51|[Zheng Lucheng] leads everyone in taking off their hats to pay tribute, with [Ding Xuesong] standing by.
1:26:51|1:27:1|Speak, she leaned on [Zheng Lucheng]'s shoulder and sobbed softly. At this moment, the injured [Mu Lan] also rushed to the wedding scene, despite her difficulty in walking, she insisted on coming to visit.
1:27:3|1:27:7|The crowd gathered together to send off [Old Monitor] on his final journey.
1:27:7|1:27:13|He is the oldest among the soldiers, but his patriotic and sincere heart is no less than any young soldier.
1:27:15|1:27:19|All the soldiers gathered by the roiling Yellow River to bid farewell.
1:27:19|1:27:23|After bidding farewell to [Old Monitor], the young soldiers should also head to the front lines.
1:27:23|1:27:28|[Zheng Lucheng], [Ding Xuesong], [Xiao Douzi], and Dr. [An] went to the front line to provide support.
1:27:28|1:27:36|The war was particularly fierce, with countless soldiers being carried down from the front, each one covered in blood and flesh, their injuries severe and hard to heal.
1:27:37|1:27:46|On the battlefield, there is constant gunfire and explosions, with a dense barrage of artillery composing a cruel symphony on this vast land.
1:27:46|1:27:55|Zheng Lucheng watched the soldiers bleeding and injured, his heart aching. He rushed to the battlefield to save people, completely disregarding his own safety.
1:27:55|1:28:1|They were transporting one car after another of wounded soldiers, with artillery shells falling nearby.
1:28:1|1:28:4|At this moment, Zheng Lucheng saw a familiar figure running around in the distance.
1:28:7|1:28:13|Recognizing him, [Zheng Lucheng] rushed into the enemy's camp to rescue him without hesitation.
1:28:13|1:28:15|At this moment, [Dr. An] was also closely following behind.
1:28:15|1:28:21|Under the cover of our firepower, Zheng Lucheng and Dr. An Bo narrowly rescued the Iron Belt.
1:28:21|1:28:25|Just as the fire was hurting people, a new round of charges was launched on the battlefield.
1:28:26|1:28:35|The brave and fearless soldiers are fighting fiercely on the battlefield, and at this moment, a wounded soldier falls to the ground, right in the most dangerous front line.
1:28:35|1:28:46|Zheng Lucheng, upon seeing the situation, bravely stepped forward and left Dr. An behind as he charged ahead, with explosions going off behind him.
1:28:46|1:28:48|Zheng Lucheng arrived at the battlefield but got trapped.
1:28:51|1:28:59|Seeing [Zheng Lucheng] surrounded, [Dr. An] disregarded his own safety and rushed forward, enduring the bombardment all the way, in a thrilling and dangerous situation.
1:28:59|1:29:3|Just then, a shell landed right next to [Dr. An].
1:29:3|1:29:7|With a loud roar, Dr. Anbo fell straight down.
1:29:13|1:29:18|Seeing the situation on the battlefield was dire, [Ding Xuesong] charged towards the front line with [Xiao Douzi].
1:29:18|1:29:28|As the two of them charged forward, a Japanese soldier who had been lying on the ground suddenly got up and fired a shot at [Xiao Douzi] running behind, hitting him in the back.
1:29:28|1:29:30|[Xiao Douzi] fell to the ground after being shot.
1:29:34|1:29:39|[Ding Xuesong] heard the gunshots and turned around, only to find [Xiao Douzi] had been shot and fallen to the ground.
1:29:39|1:29:43|At this moment, the soldiers on the front line also launched a new round of fierce attacks.
1:29:43|1:29:50|[Ding Xuesong] charged into battle with the soldiers and decisively killed the Japanese soldier who had previously attacked [Xiao Douzi].
1:29:50|1:29:55|The gunfire was still constantly bombarding, [Zheng Lucheng] signaled to the gunner, preparing to move towards the rear.
1:29:55|1:29:58|And at this moment, the heart-wrenching charge sounded.
1:30:0|1:30:8|Thousands of Eighth Route Army soldiers rode out from the rear on horseback, wielding large knives and shouting loudly as they charged into the battlefield.
1:30:8|1:30:18|And the passion of this battle completely infected [Zheng Lucheng], making him realize clearly why it is said that we are an unbeatable team.
1:30:18|1:30:24|In the face of such brave and fearless warriors, even with all their abilities, the Japanese invaders could not shake us in the slightest.
1:31:23|1:31:29|Returning from the battlefield to the riverside, [Zheng Lucheng] began to revise the "Eight Route Army March".
1:31:29|1:31:33|After this experience of going to the front-line battlefield, he finally had a real sense of war.
1:31:33|1:31:40|The excitement in his heart is hard to contain whenever he thinks of those Eighth Route Army soldiers who sacrificed their lives on the battlefield.
1:31:40|1:31:48|He turned these feelings of indignation into musical notes, rewriting the "Eight Route Army March", and this newly composed song is majestic and resounding.
1:31:50|1:31:55|It praises and showcases the fearless spirit of the Eighth Route Army soldiers as they advance bravely.
1:31:55|1:32:8|The melody is not only majestic, but also full of youthful vitality. This song closely follows the advance of the [Eighth Route Army], in sync with the victorious rhythm, like a song played on the land of the motherland.
1:32:8|1:32:14|This song resounds on every battlefield where the fires of war rage, sung by every soldier of the [Eighth Route Army].
1:32:16|1:32:35|In the future, this song "March of the [Eighth Route Army]" was also renamed "March of the Chinese People's Liberation Army". In the place where the red flag flies, towards the victory of the whole country, towards the liberation of the people, times have changed. Today's Chinese People's Liberation Army, even with modern equipment and new military uniforms.
1:32:35|1:32:38|The combination with this song is still so harmoniously unified.
1:32:39|1:32:59|In the struggle for national independence and human liberation, no matter in which era, this is a very simple and sincere vision. This song is not grandiose rhetoric, but a fitting expression of the people's aspirations and patriotic feelings. It is precisely because of this song that it can stand the test of time and be widely circulated.
1:32:59|1:33:6|Today's China is prosperous and strong, entering a new era of running, which is a magnificent scene in history.
1:33:8|1:33:15|In this way, we, as we are now, are enough to comfort the revolutionary predecessors who shed blood and sweat.
1:33:15|1:33:25|In 1988, the Central Military Commission issued an order, officially designating "March of the Volunteers" as the national anthem of the People's Liberation Army of China.
1:33:25|1:33:32|Comrade [Zheng Lucheng] passed away in Beijing on December 7, 1976, at the age of 62.
