0:1:14|0:1:24|In the vast wilderness, a withered tree stands tall. Shrouded in mist, the camera gradually pulls back, revealing a narrow path winding through the undulating mountains.
0:1:24|0:1:30|Yu Yuan drove a jeep close, with four young men and women on the car, creating an exceptionally cheerful atmosphere.
0:1:30|0:1:38|The jeep rushed through the narrow road, and only saw a stone by the roadside with "Red Wheat Forest" written on it.
0:1:38|0:1:43|The jeep drives by, revealing the title of the film, "The Watcher: Lost in Sin".
0:1:45|0:1:52|In the car, the four individuals arrived in front of an ancient mansion. Although the mansion was surrounded by trees, it inexplicably exuded a sinister atmosphere.
0:1:53|0:1:55|[Chu Xiaoli] approached and knocked on the door, calling out.
0:2:17|0:2:38|I think if we want to stay overnight today, we'll have to figure out another way. The four of them were about to leave, thinking of another way. Just as they turned around, there was a muffled sound coming from the gate of the ancient mansion. The heavy gate slowly opened from the inside, accompanied by the cawing of crows, and [Chen Zhihui] walked out calmly.
0:2:38|0:2:41|The four quickly turned around, with [Chu Xiaoli] asking.
0:3:48|0:3:56|Four people woke up and hurried into the courtyard. The courtyard was heavily immersed, surrounded by plants, but the gloomy weather added a touch of coldness.
0:4:6|0:4:11|With a loud bang, Chen Zhihui closed the door and coldly advised the four people in the courtyard.
0:4:11|0:4:16|The four of them were startled and arrived at the room where the four of them lived. The fat man said.
0:4:43|0:4:45|As for him.
0:4:53|0:4:56|[Zhi Qiang] and the fat guy came out of the room and said.
0:5:14|0:5:22|[Zhi Qiang] left alone, while the fat man became interested in the three large jars placed in the courtyard, squatting down to observe carefully, muttering to himself.
0:5:55|0:6:4|[Chen Zhihui] watched the fat man leave, accompanied by a meow. As night fell, the four of them prepared to have dinner inside the house.
0:6:4|0:6:7|[Chen Zhihui] quietly watched the four people in the yard while holding a cat.
0:6:8|0:6:9|Suddenly, the power went out.
0:6:47|0:6:53|After dinner, Fatso walked alone in the courtyard and turned to see the big vat in the courtyard, sparking his interest again.
0:6:53|0:6:59|Approaching and squatting down to examine carefully, a voice was heard from behind.
0:7:22|0:7:26|[Chen Zhihui] invited Fatty into the room, and the two sat in front of the table.
0:7:47|0:7:49|He slowly unfolds a handkerchief.
0:7:54|0:7:59|Five hundred years ago, only the local chieftain was qualified to own it.
0:7:59|0:8:2|Chen Zhihui slowly stood up with the headband in his hand.
0:8:8|0:8:13|Approaching the fat man from behind, [Chen Zhihui] put a headband on him, and a nail suddenly appeared in his palm.
0:8:19|0:8:22|He took out a soft hammer from his pocket again.
0:8:26|0:8:29|The hammer fell, and Chen Zhihui's eyes widened instantly.
0:8:29|0:8:33|The next morning, [Zhi Qiang] suddenly sat up and walked into the interrogation room.
0:8:42|0:8:44|In [Fatty]'s room.
0:9:36|0:9:40|[Chu Xiaoli] and Zhenzhen were the first to walk out of the house.
0:9:40|0:9:44|[Zhi Qiang] looked puzzled at the neatly made bed before leaving.
0:9:44|0:9:46|Facing [Chen Zhihui], he asked.
0:9:59|0:10:2|[Chen Zhihui] gazed intently as the three of them walked away.
0:10:4|0:10:8|Three people drove a jeep and arrived near a flat grassland.
0:10:23|0:10:27|Zhenzhen and [Zhi Qiang] looked at [Chu Xiaoli], waiting for the phone to connect.
0:10:27|0:10:33|Unexpectedly, the ringing of the phone came from the fourth large vat that suddenly appeared in the ancient mansion.
0:10:42|0:10:46|[Zhi Qiang] came to the hill with a camera.
0:10:53|0:10:58|[Zhi Qiang] and Jane looked at each other, but Xiaoli suddenly smirked.
0:11:0|0:11:2|The two of them sighed helplessly.
0:11:9|0:11:13|Xiaoli turned around and walked back, Zhenzhen and [Zhi Qiang] started shooting on the hillside.
0:11:15|0:11:24|The scene suddenly changes, with a mysterious turn of the cat's head. Xiaoli pushes open the door of the ancient mansion, and the cat then crouches down and runs away.
0:11:24|0:11:29|Xiaoli arrived at the courtyard and found it empty, then she went to her own room.
0:11:29|0:11:34|Pushing open the door, Chen Zhihui found a large lock hanging on his door.
0:11:34|0:11:39|Next, she turned and walked into the fat man's room, where there was still only an empty bed.
0:12:6|0:12:12|Xiaoli gently walked into the inner room and pushed open the half-closed door.
0:12:12|0:12:16|The surroundings were lit up, but still no one was around.
0:12:16|0:12:20|Suddenly, a voice of Chen Zhihui came from behind.
0:12:21|0:12:26|Xiaoli suddenly turned around, and Chen Zhihui stood expressionless at the door.
0:13:15|0:13:19|[Chen Zhihui] walked past Xiaoli and approached the door, ready to close it.
0:13:19|0:13:28|Chu Hongwei, who used to have a straightforward personality, has now been conquered by Zhao Tianlan.
0:14:9|0:14:30|[Chen Zhihui] reached out to invite Xiaoli to sit down. Xiaoli looked hesitant but reluctantly sat down. [Chen Zhihui] then turned and walked into the gift area. In a moment, he appeared holding a headband in his hands. Upon closer inspection, this headband was exactly the same as the one shown to the fat man.
0:15:4|0:15:11|Chu Xiaoli took off the sunglasses on her head, while Chen Zhihui stood behind her and slowly put a headband on her.
0:15:33|0:15:38|[Chen Zhihui] holds a nail in his right hand and a hammer in his left hand, ready to nail it down for Yang Qi.
0:16:30|0:16:38|Xiaoli and [Zhi Qiang] waved goodbye, Zhenzhen, unable to move, had to lie down on the blanket and fell asleep.
0:16:38|0:16:45|In a daze, she heard music coming from a distance, and she sat up and listened carefully, as if she had remembered something.
0:16:46|0:16:52|Zhenzhen quickly got up and rushed to the courtyard, heading straight to the fat man's room and pushing the door open.
0:16:54|0:17:1|Pushing open the door, Chen Zhihui found the neatly made bed as usual, with only the radio on the table playing music.
0:17:1|0:17:6|[Chu Xiaoli] approached, picked up the radio on the table, and examined it closely with her head down.
0:17:6|0:17:14|At this moment, the closed door behind them was slowly pushed open, and [Chen Zhihui] stared intently at [Chu Xiaoli] who had not noticed him.
0:17:14|0:17:26|With a click, the scene cuts to [Zhi Qiang] and [Chu Xiaoli] taking photos. The gentle breeze brushes their faces as they look at the finished pictures, sharing a smile.
0:17:38|0:17:44|Speak up, [Chu Xiaoli] once again called the fat man, and the bell rang again from the big vat in the courtyard.
0:17:46|0:17:49|It just became five this time.
0:18:2|0:18:8|The two returned to the ancient mansion, pushed open the door of the main house, and found it empty inside.
0:18:11|0:18:19|Before they arrived at the carved flower factory covered by the curtain, they exchanged a glance and suddenly pulled open the curtain.
0:18:19|0:18:22|Only a few cushions were left on top.
0:18:22|0:18:25|Suddenly, Chen Zhihui's voice came over.
0:19:18|0:19:21|After saying that, [Chen Zhihui] turned around and left with the cat in his arms.
0:19:21|0:19:25|The two of them looked puzzled and started searching inside the room.
0:19:25|0:19:33|[Chu Xiaoli] tiptoed and rummaged through the wardrobe for what Zhenzhen had mentioned, only to find a bag full of snacks when she opened it.
0:19:34|0:19:41|Just as [Chu Xiaoli] was trying to step further inside, she accidentally stepped on the mouse hole.
0:19:55|0:20:0|[Chen Zhihui] appears at the door of the room and walks in while speaking.
0:20:22|0:20:24|Driving at night was very bumpy.
0:20:35|0:20:40|[Chen Zhihui] glared angrily, startling both of them.
0:20:40|0:20:44|[Zhi Qiang] hurriedly ran out of the room, but not without turning back to glance at [Chu Xiaoli].
0:20:44|0:20:51|At this moment, [Chen Zhihui], who was still in the room, slowly turned his head to look at [Chu Xiaoli] with a cold and sinister gaze.
0:20:51|0:20:53|[Chu Xiaoli] timidly averted her gaze.
0:20:58|0:21:2|As Zhi Qiang drove away, the night grew deeper.
0:21:2|0:21:13|At this moment, a cat was lying at the door, turning its head to look elsewhere, as if foreshadowing that something was about to happen.
0:21:13|0:21:21|In the room, [Chu Xiaoli] lay in bed with her feet bandaged, and there was no sign of [Chen Zhihui] in the room.
0:21:22|0:21:27|The overhead chandelier flickered, casting a hint of eerie atmosphere.
0:21:27|0:21:33|At this moment, there was a faint jingling sound coming from the courtyard.
0:21:33|0:21:39|[Chu Xiaoli] woke up groggily, disturbed by the noise outside, but seemed a bit unsure.
0:21:39|0:21:43|After listening carefully, the sound of the bell became clearer.
0:21:45|0:21:53|He quickly got up and, ignoring his injured foot, limped out of the room in search of the source of the sound.
0:21:53|0:22:0|Arriving in the courtyard, the sound unexpectedly came from inside the large vat in the courtyard.
0:22:0|0:22:9|[Chu Xiaoli] walked slowly towards the large vat in the courtyard, the clinking sound inside the vat continued incessantly.
0:22:9|0:22:21|He tried to lift the lid with his hands. Five beats later, he squatted down again and tried hard to push the lid open. At that moment, a hand suddenly reached out from the jar and tightly grabbed Chu Xiaoli's neck.
0:22:21|0:22:26|She widened her eyes and struggled desperately.
0:22:26|0:22:29|Suddenly woke up, sat up, and just breathed a sigh of relief.
0:22:29|0:22:36|With a glance, [Chen Zhihui] holding a headband, quietly stood at the doorway.
0:22:39|0:22:41|[Chu Xiaoli] looks blue-faced and nods.
0:23:13|0:23:18|[Chen Zhihui] stood behind [Chu Xiaoli] and slowly put a headband on her.
0:23:39|0:23:47|[Chen Zhihui] was holding a nail in his right hand and just touched the claw hammer in his pocket with his left hand when the door was suddenly pushed open by [Zhi Qiang].
0:24:21|0:24:25|After speaking, he did not leave the room.
0:24:37|0:24:40|[Zhi Qiang] turned around, took out a fruit knife from his backpack, and put it in his pocket.
0:24:40|0:24:42|The dim lighting, [Zhi Qiang] constantly illuminating the surroundings, nervously carrying a fruit knife behind him, followed [Chen Zhihui] into the hall.
0:25:3|0:25:10|[Chen Zhihui] unabashedly placed the ram's horn hammer on the table and smiled as he sat down across from [Zhi Qiang].
0:25:20|0:25:22|Chen Zhihui looks at the hands of Zhi Qiang.
0:25:31|0:25:39|[Chen Zhihui] looked at [Zhi Qiang] with calm eyes, his gaze heavy as he raised his hands to show his innocence.
0:25:39|0:25:46|[Zhi Qiang] hesitated in his gaze, but it was still filled with caution.
0:25:46|0:25:53|[Chen Zhihui] turned around and went back into the room to get something, and the lights started flickering again.
0:25:53|0:26:0|When the lights came back on, [Chen Zhihui] walked out slowly with a wooden tray, which was carved with various exotic animals and beasts.
0:26:21|0:26:29|[Zhi Qiang] was puzzled, but still put away the water rolling knife behind him, and took the wooden plate full of patterns in his hands, carefully examining it.
0:26:32|0:26:35|In an instant, [Chen Zhihui] pulled out the dagger hidden under the wooden tray and stabbed towards [Zhi Qiang] fiercely.
0:26:59|0:27:9|When the dagger was drawn, [Zhi Qiang] had lost consciousness and slumped limp from the chair.
0:27:9|0:27:14|[Chu Xiaoli], who was walking out of the room, heard the bell ringing in the courtyard, as if she had remembered something.
0:27:30|0:27:39|Hearing the sound of the door closing, [Chu Xiaoli] looked up and saw [Chen Zhihui] holding a dagger, his hand slowly approaching [Chu Xiaoli] with a blood-stained dagger.
0:27:59|0:28:3|Chu Xiaoli nervously picked up the sheep horn hammer on the table for self-defense.
0:28:39|0:28:42|[Chu Xiaoli] is scared, only able to dodge back and forth in the room.
0:28:59|0:29:1|Huang Xiuli went wherever she wanted.
0:29:11|0:29:18|The killing intent suddenly appeared, [Chu Xiaoli] showed fear on her face, and in panic accidentally bumped into the tea set.
0:29:18|0:29:23|Twenty years ago, Huang Xiuli changed for a reason.
0:30:19|0:30:24|[Chen Zhihui] advances step by step towards [Chu Xiaoli] with a blood-stained dagger in hand.
0:30:24|0:30:26|Suddenly, the power went out.
0:30:26|0:30:31|In the darkness, [Chu Xiaoli] narrowly dodges past.
0:30:38|0:30:44|The blade flashed, and [Chu Xiaoli] could only rely on her voice to grope and dodge in the darkness.
0:30:48|0:30:52|In the darkness, every sound was unusually clear.
0:30:52|0:30:56|[Chu Xiaoli] held her breath, listening to the increasingly silent footsteps.
0:30:56|0:31:1|Seizing the opportunity, [Chen Zhihui] dodged skillfully and successfully avoided the dagger thrusting towards him.
0:31:1|0:31:7|But the sound of footsteps and sword swinging continued, making [Chu Xiaoli] more nervous than ever before.
0:31:7|0:31:11|Unexpectedly, the two collided back to back in this step-by-step evasion.
0:31:11|0:31:15|[Chu Xiaoli] made a quick squat, once again winning a chance at life for herself.
0:31:16|0:31:22|The danger is still ongoing, with [Chen Zhihui] in hot pursuit, luckily the light reappears.
0:31:22|0:31:29|Chu Xiaoli opens her eyes and sees Chen Zhihui with his back to her.
0:31:29|0:31:34|Seizing the opportunity, [Chu Xiaoli] raised the sheep horn hammer in her hand and smashed it down with force.
0:31:34|0:31:41|Chen Zhihui fell to the ground, Chu Xiaoli covered her face in disbelief, helplessly hugged her head and squatted down.
0:31:41|0:31:44|Tears finally fell from the eyes at this moment.
0:31:46|0:31:52|The dust settles as the police rush into the once silent ancient mansion, searching for the missing people in the courtyard.
0:31:54|0:32:0|The policewoman wrapped the overly frightened [Chu Xiaoli] in a blanket, her helpless eyes filled with terror.
0:32:0|0:32:8|[Chen Zhihui] lay on the ground without breathing, while the police were still collecting evidence. [Zhi Qiang] also received medical treatment from the medical staff.
0:32:8|0:32:16|[Chu Xiaoli] looked at the courtyard with tears in her eyes as people came and went. After the police searched for clues, their gaze fell upon the large vat in the courtyard.
0:32:16|0:32:21|Surely enough, after a cracking sound, Fatso and Jenny were found curled up at the bottom of the vat.
0:32:33|0:32:41|[Chen Zhihui] was lifted onto a stretcher. The police, feeling sorry for him, looked at his wide-open eyes, gently closed them, and covered him with a white cloth.
0:32:41|0:32:45|Both the fat guy and Zhenzhen were also carried on stretchers at the same time.
0:32:45|0:32:51|[Chu Xiaoli] watched as her friends were carried out one by one, and could only hold onto the female police officer beside her, burying her head and crying in pain.
0:32:54|0:33:6|In this bustling and busy ancient house, only the cat in the corner enjoys its solitude, quietly observing everything that is happening.
0:33:6|0:33:13|As evening falls, a bus travels on the undulating highway.
0:33:13|0:33:20|Sitting in the front row of the car is a middle-aged man of medium build, lost in thought and boredly looking out the window.
0:33:21|0:33:43|Night fell, the bus arrived at a small town, and the man reached his destination. He stopped in front of a small building called East Wind Inn, where a beautiful woman appeared, holding keys and a water bottle. She led the middle-aged man who had just arrived at the door to the second floor of the inn.
0:33:54|0:33:57|After entering the room, Chen Zhihui privately sizes up the man.
0:33:57|0:34:2|In the small room, there is a simple small bed and a table placed crudely.
0:34:2|0:34:6|[Chen Zhihui] walked to the edge of the small bed and sat down, preparing to rest for a while.
0:34:6|0:34:14|Just as he took out a cigarette and put it in his mouth, his phone rang.
0:34:53|0:34:58|[Chen Zhihui] hung up the phone, glanced at the direction where the sound came from, and shrugged it off.
0:34:58|0:35:3|He then stood up and took out the toiletry bag from his backpack, preparing to freshen up.
0:35:3|0:35:9|Unexpectedly, as soon as Chen Zhihui took out the water basin for brushing his teeth, the banging sound next door continued.
0:35:9|0:35:15|The man finally couldn't bear it, put down the toothbrush cup heavily, opened the door and went to the next door.
0:35:16|0:35:20|Pushing open the door of the next room, they found it empty with no one inside.
0:35:20|0:35:29|The man searched around and then saw the nails on the wall. He walked closer and touched the nails, as if confirming whether the sound was coming from him.
0:35:29|0:35:32|At this moment, a voice could be heard at the door.
0:35:34|0:35:38|The man turned around and saw [Chen Zhihui] standing at the door.
0:35:38|0:35:41|When the lights came on, [Chen Zhihui] was seen holding a sheep horn hammer.
0:35:53|0:36:11|[Chen Zhihui] did not say a word as he looked at him, but walked slowly into the room, passed the middle-aged man, hammered a nail into the wall, and then hung the picture frame on the wall.
0:36:13|0:36:20|Hua Bi turned around to look at the middle-aged man.
0:36:20|0:36:24|The middle-aged man forced a smile and then left awkwardly.
0:36:24|0:36:31|Chen Zhihui paid no attention to the man's departure and continued to gaze at the butterfly painting on the wall.
0:36:31|0:36:36|The next morning, Chen Zhihui, a middle-aged man, sat down on the first floor of the inn with his breakfast.
0:36:36|0:36:40|He hadn't even sat down yet when the phone in his pocket started ringing.
0:37:19|0:37:23|The waiter pointed to the middle-aged man behind [Chen Zhihui].
0:37:23|0:37:25|He turned his head and the two of them smiled politely.
0:37:25|0:37:28|Next, the two sat down at a table.
0:38:10|0:38:17|Just based on this breakfast, the two finished their breakfast and casually walked towards the door together.
0:38:17|0:38:29|The middle-aged man noticed the [Female Manager] sitting at the front desk, with her styled hair, delicate features, fashionable attire, and she tidied her temples to the accompaniment of lyrical music.
0:38:29|0:38:34|Her every move exudes charm, causing the middle-aged man to involuntarily glance at her a few more times.
0:38:37|0:38:44|And at this moment, [Female Manager] also noticed the middle-aged man raising his head.
0:38:44|0:38:46|The two of them arrived at the entrance of the inn and started talking.
0:39:45|0:39:51|[Chen Zhihui] was puzzled and confused, the middle-aged man seemed to have figured something out, nodding his head knowingly.
0:40:23|0:40:28|[Chen Zhihui] did not stop, and then a middle-aged man came to Huang Jinzheng's door, knocked on it, and was greeted by a young man who opened the door.
0:41:15|0:41:19|[Zhou Dong] entered the room and saw a full wall of family photos.
0:42:22|0:42:27|With the melodious music playing, a romantic atmosphere fills the inn.
0:42:27|0:42:31|Two young waiters are dancing the ballroom dance gracefully.
0:42:31|0:42:35|However, the two girls always accidentally stepped on each other's feet.
0:42:38|0:42:44|At this moment, [Zhou Dong] returned from outside, and the young girl quickly stopped and stood aside.
0:43:1|0:43:8|The little girl without a mouth smirked, and [Zhou Dong] happened to see [Chen Zhihui] sitting in the lobby, so he went up to talk to him.
0:44:17|0:44:29|He finished speaking, got up to leave, then stopped in his tracks, lowered his head and said to [Chen Zhihui].
0:44:29|0:44:37|[Chen Zhihui] fell into contemplation after hearing that, thinking alone in the empty hall.
0:45:34|0:45:38|[Chen Zhihui] still sat quietly without any rebuttal.
0:45:38|0:45:42|[Zhou Dong] finished speaking and lit the cigarette in his mouth absentmindedly.
0:47:17|0:47:24|He refocused his gaze on [Chen Zhihui] and made a prediction.
0:47:38|0:47:42|The laughter of the front desk girl interrupted his words.
0:47:57|0:47:59|[Chen Zhihui] is waiting for [Zhou Dong]'s answer.
0:47:59|0:48:3|[Zhou Dong] scratched his head and smiled, sitting up straight.
0:48:7|0:48:11|[Chen Zhihui] waited for his next move, but what he got was [Zhou Dong] looking towards the door.
0:48:11|0:48:15|The landlady of the inn, Red Sister, walked in unsteadily.
0:48:46|0:48:55|Red Sister was sitting at the front desk, looking down at her phone. With one hand lightly tapping the desk, she looked up and gazed at [Zhou Dong] in front of her.
0:49:27|0:49:36|The two locked arms, gazed into each other's eyes and shared a smile, then quickly looked away, creating a romantic and beautiful atmosphere.
0:49:36|0:49:46|In the hall, [Chen Zhihui] couldn't stand the laughter of the two and got up to go upstairs, leaving behind the cat quietly held below.
0:49:49|0:50:4|The waiter drove the cat away, and [Chen Zhihui] in his room looked through the window, his eyes fixed on the cat being driven away, curled up in a deserted corner.
0:50:4|0:50:14|At three o'clock in the afternoon, Zhou Dong returned to the second floor to get his phone, suddenly remembering Chen Zhihui next door, and called out.
0:50:14|0:50:18|[Zhou Dong] came to a stop at the next door, without knocking, he pushed the door open.
0:50:48|0:50:53|Accompanied by the exciting music, [Chen Zhihui] and [Chu Xiaoli] jumped up together.
0:50:53|0:50:56|[Chen Zhihui], invited by [Zhou Dong], also sat on the first floor.
0:50:56|0:51:2|However, his calm expression without any ripples, juxtaposed with the intense music, created a stark contrast.
0:51:2|0:51:9|[Zhou Dong] was already immersed in dancing with Sister Hong, and the two waiters beside him also started dancing in a decent manner.
0:51:9|0:51:12|Only [Chen Zhihui] maintained a constant expression from beginning to end.
0:51:14|0:51:20|As the music reached its climax, Chen Zhihui and Chu Xiaoli spun around, freezing at the last second of the music.
0:51:20|0:51:26|The waiter next to her also clapped and cheered, while [Chu Xiaoli] wiped the sweat off with a smile.
0:51:26|0:51:31|[Zhou Dong] also came over to [Chen Zhihui]'s side, and took the opportunity of getting a drink to talk to [Chen Zhihui] again.
0:52:10|0:52:18|With a slight step forward, [Chu Xiaoli] showed no sign of annoyance, but instead began swaying her waist along with the music.
0:52:18|0:52:19|Before the dance.
0:52:33|0:52:40|Put the birds raised by plants into the tent room.
0:52:47|0:52:54|After finishing the dance, amidst the cheers of the waiters, [Zhou Dong] took a deep drag of his cigarette and continued chatting with [Chen Zhihui].
0:53:27|0:53:34|After speaking, [Zhou Dong] got up and left, while [Chen Zhihui] finally focused his gaze on the two of them.
0:53:34|0:53:41|This time, the music becomes romantic, as the two face off, each twisting their waist to show their charm.
0:53:42|0:53:47|[Zhou Dong] even took off his coat and stood up the collar of his shirt.
0:53:47|0:53:55|On the other hand, [Chu Xiaoli], with a swift turn, cut her hair in a flowing wave-like style, and began to dance.
0:53:55|0:54:0|Both of them were immersed in the enchanting music, their interactions were very tacit.
0:54:14|0:54:18|But, on one afternoon.
0:54:22|0:54:25|And opened up his heart.
0:54:30|0:54:38|And those young men who once had dreams about her, too.
0:55:40|0:55:42|One year ago.
0:55:48|0:55:51|Also the room manager of a hotel.
0:56:7|0:56:14|[Zhou Dong] eyes red, fiercely knocking the lighter on the table.
0:56:35|0:56:42|Hong Jie and others were startled by the sudden appearance.
0:56:42|0:56:50|[Zhou Dong] stared at [Chen Zhihui] with a cold gaze, while [Chen Zhihui] seemed to have made a decision as well, slowly straightening up.
0:56:50|0:56:55|At 5 o'clock in the afternoon, Hong Jie changed to a new tune and prepared to invite [Zhou Dong].
0:58:9|0:58:25|After Zhou Dong smiled and replied, he walked towards [Red Sister], while Chen Zhihui still maintained the posture of his previous inquiry, as if savoring the answer. However, his eyes were fixed in one direction, seemingly with a hint of something inexplicable in his gaze.
0:58:25|0:58:40|Later, he stood up and walked towards the second floor. Although his steps were slow, they were filled with determination. [Zhou Dong] stood in front of [Red Sister], bending down in a gentlemanly gesture, causing the waitress to giggle.
0:58:40|0:58:45|But [Chu Xiaoli] was not at all vague, stepping on high heels and walking towards the open space first.
0:58:45|0:58:48|They then held hands and gestured to each other.
0:58:52|0:59:13|Twelve saw [Zhou Dong] raise his hand high, and [Red Sister] followed suit, dancing in a passionate and intense manner. The two of them were completely immersed in the dance. The waiter on the side also followed their movements and started dancing along. The atmosphere at the moment was harmonious and joyful. Meanwhile, [Chen Zhihui] had already arrived at the door of his room.
0:59:13|0:59:27|He forcefully pushed open the door of his room, his gaze falling on the corner hammer on the table. After gently touching it with his hand, he put the corner hammer into his pocket, closed the room door, and returned to the first floor.
0:59:27|0:59:31|At this moment, the atmosphere downstairs has reached its climax.
1:0:9|1:0:14|[Red Sister] left with the waiter, [Chen Zhihui] walked over to [Zhou Dong]'s side.
1:0:16|1:0:21|Soon after, accompanied by the meow of a cat, the two of them stepped out of the East Wind Film Society.
1:0:21|1:0:28|The scene keeps switching between the two people and the cat until finally settling on their backs.
1:0:28|1:0:33|At this moment, it was already dark, and the two of them arrived at the entrance of the house.
1:0:33|1:0:35|Zhou Dong spoke up.
1:0:46|1:0:55|The courtyard is hosting a magnificent drama performance, with a full house and lively chatter from the audience.
1:0:55|1:0:58|Mr. Huang Jing is toasting with the staff.
1:1:9|1:1:14|Huang Hao brought [Zhou Dong] to visit the old man. After toasting each other, [Zhou Dong] took his seat.
1:1:14|1:1:23|The fire-blowing performance on stage pushed the atmosphere to a climax.
1:1:23|1:1:29|At this moment, [Chen Zhihui] mysteriously appeared in a corner of the courtyard, quietly observing everything in the courtyard.
1:1:57|1:2:13|[Zhou Dong] sat at the table, constantly looking around as if searching for something. It wasn't until he saw [Chen Zhihui] standing in a corner of the courtyard that a smile appeared on his face. The two of them raised their wine glasses in perfect harmony, clinking them together across the distance and then finishing their drinks in one gulp.
1:2:13|1:2:19|And at this moment, the queen was drinking with guests when suddenly interrupted by a young man patting her on the back.
1:4:50|1:5:2|Chen Zhihui slowly took out the sheep horn hammer from his pocket, while Huang Hao, lying horizontally on the sofa in the room, had already fallen silent, and on the floor were the drunk intruders who had just stumbled in.
1:5:2|1:5:6|After taking a careful look at the photo of Huang Xiuli, [Chen Zhihui] returned to the lobby.
1:5:12|1:5:19|In the hall, the crowd cheered and urged a couple to come on stage to perform, while [Chen Zhihui] sat next to [Zhou Dong].
1:5:19|1:5:24|[Zhou Dong] saw the newcomer and joyfully punched [Chen Zhihui] with his fist.
1:6:4|1:6:18|[Zhou Dong] could only smile wryly, picked up a few glasses of wine and drank them down. Just then, the drunkard in the room slowly woke up, staggered out of the room, still clamoring for more drinks.
1:6:18|1:6:30|The performance on stage caused a big laugh from the audience, and the young man who delivered the message for the queen also appeared next to the old emperor.
1:7:45|1:7:52|The old man was arrogant, while [Chen Zhihui] appeared with a deep gaze, suddenly taking out a sheep horn hammer from his sleeve.
1:7:52|1:7:59|This time, next to the sofa where Huang Hao is lying, there is an extra recliner, and [Huang Jingzheng] is quietly lying on it.
1:8:3|1:8:11|[Zhou Dong] was a little tipsy, and when he looked up, his eyes met the gaze of the beautiful woman who was watching him at the table.
1:8:11|1:8:15|Before the next move could be made, [Chen Zhihui] looked out from behind him again.
1:8:29|1:8:33|Two beautiful women were bathing by the river, but he just walked away without even looking.
1:8:35|1:8:42|After finishing a drink, [Zhou Dong] began to feel drowsy and fell asleep in his chair.
1:9:3|1:9:19|The elderly couple on the side felt a sense of familiarity as they watched [Chen Zhihui] stand up, and they whispered to each other.
1:9:19|1:9:23|Mrs. Huang was still looking for Mr. Huang, when the phone rang.
1:9:40|1:9:44|The father and son are now completely drunk and unable to speak.
1:9:57|1:10:4|[Chen Zhihui] appears behind the old lady, placing his hands on her shoulders and turning her body around.
1:10:35|1:10:39|The old lady was choked and stopped struggling after a few moments.
1:10:39|1:10:43|The hall was silent, with only [Zhou Dong] lying on the table.
1:10:50|1:11:4|Hey, Zhou Dong is already unconscious. Chen Zhihui looked up and saw the untouched green needlefish on the table, as if he had figured something out. He then turned off the courtyard's power switch, plunging the entire mansion into darkness.
1:11:4|1:11:9|In the darkness, [Chen Zhihui] packed up the fish, carrying [Zhou Dong] on his shoulder, and strolled out of the palace.
1:11:11|1:11:20|In the inn, while the Female Manager was bored and staring absentmindedly at the fish tank in front of her, Chen Zhihui walked in carrying Zhou Dong.
1:11:20|1:11:29|Red Sister stood up as soon as she saw it, but [Chen Zhihui] did not give her a chance to speak. He glanced at her and then carried [Zhou Dong] upstairs.
1:11:32|1:11:42|Later, [Chen Zhihui] placed [Zhou Dong] on the bed, considerately helped him take off his coat and covered him with a blanket, and prepared a glass of water on the side.
1:11:42|1:11:44|[Zhou Dong] has fallen deeply into a dream.
1:11:49|1:11:55|The cat looked at [Chen Zhihui] who approached, not running away in fear, but staring at him.
1:11:55|1:12:5|[Chen Zhihui] opened the plastic bag in his hand, took out the packaged fish, placed it in front of the cat, squatted down quietly, and watched the cat eat the fish.
1:12:5|1:12:10|At this moment, a person and a cat are keeping each other company in the quiet night.
1:12:10|1:12:17|In the room, after waking up, [Zhou Dong] did not immediately get out of bed, but stayed in the covers and made a phone call to a friend.
1:13:46|1:13:59|As Zhou Dong sat up, it was already daytime outside the window of the inn, with people coming and going at the entrance. In the distance, a large truck slowly approached in silence.
1:13:59|1:14:4|The car was filled to the brim with overflowing barrels, and only the boss's instructions to the driver could be heard.
1:14:10|1:14:13|[Zhou Dong] is having breakfast in the lobby.
1:14:15|1:14:19|[Chen Zhihui] sat down with a bag in hand.
1:15:37|1:15:43|[Chen Zhihui] looked thoughtful for a moment, then smiled slightly and answered.
1:15:46|1:15:51|The two packed up their things, carried their bags and walked out of the inn. As they passed the front desk, their steps hesitated slightly.
1:15:53|1:15:58|Upon seeing the two of them, Hong Jie stood up, glanced at [Zhou Dong], then at [Chen Zhihui], and asked.
1:16:11|1:16:20|[Zhou Dong] turned around and walked away. Just as he was about to leave the gate, he turned back to look at Red Sister, smiled slightly, and nodded in acknowledgment.
1:16:20|1:16:27|And Hong Jie also never took back her gaze, watching as [Zhou Dong] and the two of them walked out of the inn.
1:16:27|1:16:36|[Chen Zhihui] found the cat at the door, held her in his arms, and stood facing each other, ready to bid farewell.
1:16:42|1:16:53|At the entrance of the inn, [Chen Zhihui] carried a bag in his left hand and held a cat in his right hand, while [Zhou Dong] had his hands in his pockets, the two of them walking in opposite directions.
1:16:53|1:17:4|[Zhou Dong] took a few steps, then turned around to look at the not-so-broad back of [Chen Zhihui]. All he had with him was a newly found kitten and a bag in his hand.
1:17:4|1:17:6|Lost in thought for a moment, Weiwei couldn't help but shout out.
1:17:9|1:17:15|[Chen Zhihui] turned around, [Zhou Dong] stood in place, smiling and shouting.
1:17:24|1:17:35|A friend from afar arrives, a smile gradually appears on [Chen Zhihui]'s face, [Zhou Dong] waves goodbye, [Chen Zhihui] turns around and leaves again.
1:17:35|1:17:40|This time, the two of them have completely parted ways, each embarking on a new journey.
1:18:51|1:18:55|[Female Manager] resumed the posture she had just had, her eyes looking towards the door.
1:18:55|1:19:3|[Zhou Dong] has already boarded the departing bus, only to hear people on the bus discussing.
1:19:19|1:19:26|[Zhou Dong] smiled and looked out the window. The bus had arrived at Dream Tower, and he suddenly remembered what [Chen Zhihui] had said.
1:19:43|1:19:47|It's the carpenter who caused a murder case and was later sent to prison.
1:19:54|1:19:59|It is said that this guy was quite crazy back then, almost killed Huang Xiuli.
1:20:16|1:20:18|[Zhou Dong] hurriedly got out of the car.
1:20:18|1:20:23|Making phone calls as soon as he got off the car, but unfortunately, no one answered the call.
1:20:23|1:20:27|The scenes from a few days ago kept flashing through his mind.
1:20:27|1:20:31|He had a serious expression and didn't care about the danger, directly stopping a car on the road.
1:20:31|1:20:37|Unfortunately, the vehicles on the road rushed past, and in the end, he only managed to stop a motorcycle.
1:20:37|1:20:42|The motorcycle brought him back to the door of [Zhou Dong]'s house, where he repeatedly knocked on the door.
1:20:44|1:20:47|Seeing no one answering, [Zhou Dong] ran back to the main street.
1:20:47|1:20:53|At this moment, she was already sweating profusely, but she didn't dare to take a break.
1:20:53|1:20:58|It's noon, with tourists and vendors bustling on the street, creating a romantic atmosphere of destiny.
1:20:58|1:21:4|[Zhou Dong] stood still, feeling as if the whole world was spinning in her mind.
1:21:4|1:21:10|She could only shuttle through the crowd with all her might, time and time again, searching for the person she was looking for.
1:21:11|1:21:16|His eyes have started to become cold, but he still hasn't given up.
1:21:16|1:21:22|Until he turned around and saw a man who looked very much like [Chen Zhihui].
1:21:22|1:21:28|At this moment, the world was incredibly quiet, and in his eyes, there was only that man.
1:21:28|1:21:32|He hurriedly chased after, pulling abruptly, only to find out it wasn't the person he was looking for.
1:21:37|1:21:45|[Zhou Dong] got back on the bus, but it wasn't heading towards the provincial capital. He was seen getting off the bus among the undulating hills.
1:21:45|1:21:51|The desolate street was deserted, and he could only rely on his own legs to run under the scorching sun.
1:21:51|1:21:56|After walking for who knows how long, feeling mentally foggy, the sound of a car came from behind.
1:21:56|1:22:0|[Zhou Dong] confirmed repeatedly that it was not his own illusion, and quickly waved his hand.
1:22:1|1:22:7|The car that arrived had two men and two women sitting in it, and one of them was none other than [Chu Xiaoli] from the beginning.
1:22:7|1:22:12|[Zhou Dong] disregarded the danger and stood alone in front of the car, forcibly stopping it.
1:22:37|1:22:41|The car drove away, leaving [Zhou Dong] to continue moving forward.
1:22:41|1:22:46|Walking along a mountain path, a mother and daughter approached, engaged in conversation.
1:23:7|1:23:17|Zhou Dong hurried to the entrance of the ancient house and immediately spotted the cat lying there, the same one that Chen Zhihui had taken away when he left.
1:23:17|1:23:19|He immediately felt something was wrong, banging on the door frantically and shouting.
1:23:32|1:23:36|[Zhou Dong] kept knocking on the door repeatedly, but no one answered.
1:23:36|1:23:46|He was a little absent-minded for a moment, then turned around to see a cat, as if remembering something, and vented by kicking the door.
1:23:46|1:23:48|The cat was scared and ran away suddenly.
1:23:48|1:23:54|[Zhou Dong] looked lost and confused. As he left, he suddenly heard [Chen Zhihui]'s voice again.
1:24:0|1:24:4|[Zhou Dong] suddenly turned around, his eyes wide open, staring at the door.
1:24:4|1:24:13|The camera zooms in continuously, finally focusing on the figure of [Zhou Dong], passing through his body, and starting to replay everything that happened before.
1:24:13|1:24:23|The outline of the manor, [Chu Xiaoli]'s vigorous strike, the lively Yuanqi of the queen's family, the hot dance of [Zhou Dong] and Red Sister in the inn, and the first meeting of [Zhou Dong] and [Chen Zhihui].
1:24:24|1:24:36|The final shot is set at the entrance of the Shunjiang City First Prison, where two soldiers stand guard in front of the imposing prison gate, with no one else in sight.
1:24:36|1:24:46|In the silence, the sound of a door opening is heard, and a middle-aged man with half-white hair and slightly wrinkled clothes walks out, who is none other than [Chen Zhihui].
1:24:46|1:24:58|[Chen Zhihui] walked a few meters and then stopped, looking up at the exceptionally clear sky. After a while, he turned around to look back at the prison he had just walked out of.
1:24:58|1:25:13|After a moment of silence, [Chen Zhihui] arrived at a fork in the road. He stood still at the intersection, with signs on the road indicating "Dream Tower" to the left and "Pan Family Town" to the right. He looked left and then right, seeming a bit hesitant.
1:25:16|1:25:24|Hesitating, he turned and looked towards a teahouse by the intersection. Despite walking in, the teahouse was crowded but not noisy.
1:25:24|1:25:35|Chen Zhihui sat down, and the waiter brought a pot of tea.
1:25:35|1:25:40|The waiter pointed to the middle-aged man in black sitting by the window, who raised his teacup towards [Chen Zhihui].
1:25:44|1:25:48|Then she sat across from [Chen Zhihui] with a cup of tea and struck up a conversation.
1:25:50|1:25:54|Raises the cigarette in his hand and asks [Chen Zhihui].
1:26:43|1:26:51|Chen Zhihui remained silent and shook his head to every question asked by the black-clad man.
1:27:31|1:27:36|[Chen Zhihui] gazed intently, waiting for the response from [Black-clad Man].
1:27:53|1:28:4|As the waiter pushed open the door of the teahouse private room, a bald man took out a briefcase and placed it on the table. Across from him, another man also took out a briefcase.
1:28:9|1:28:18|The Black-clad Man gestured for Chen Zhihui to look towards the private room, where a waitress was just coming out, providing a clear view of the situation inside.
1:28:18|1:28:28|The bald man is speaking, while a glamorous woman is sitting on the sofa next to him. Suddenly, someone closes the door to the private room.
1:28:39|1:28:42|Da Bao looked around and saw no one nearby.
1:28:54|1:28:58|Chen Zhihui had no smile on his face, while the Black-clad Man spoke.
1:28:58|1:29:1|While still keeping an eye on the situation in the private room.
1:29:1|1:29:5|Without waiting for [Chen Zhihui] to react, [Black-clad Man] continued speaking.
1:29:33|1:29:40|The Black-clad Man chuckled, but his gaze shifted towards the two men coming out of the private room.
1:29:40|1:29:46|In the private room, the bald man closed the briefcase filled with RMB and then turned to the glamorous woman.
1:29:54|1:29:57|The glamorous woman leisurely sips her tea.
1:31:10|1:31:23|The Black-clad Man stood up, pleading with Chen Zhihui with earnest eyes. Just as he turned to leave, Chen Zhihui reacted.
1:31:45|1:31:50|The black-clad man's eyes were flashing with almost insane anger and hatred.
1:31:50|1:31:59|He pointed his finger at [Chen Zhihui], slightly pressing down, indicating that [Chen Zhihui] should sit here.
1:31:59|1:32:4|The Black-clad Man suddenly pushed open the door of the private room and looked at the bald man.
1:32:4|1:32:8|The bald man's gaze shifted, landing on the glamorous woman sitting beside him.
1:34:57|1:34:59|This guy, looks like he's willing to go through fire and water.
1:35:54|1:35:56|At this moment, [Chen Zhihui] has already left.
1:35:56|1:35:57|25 seconds before.
1:36:6|1:36:18|The glamorous woman took out an electric baton from behind and knocked down Baoge, causing the gun to accidentally fire towards the roof.
1:36:18|1:36:26|In the room, only [Black-clad Man] and [Black-clad Man's Wife] were left. Unable to continue acting, the two of them tearfully embraced each other.
1:36:43|1:36:46|The henchman pushed the door open and was also taken care of by [Black-clad Man] with an electric baton.
1:37:32|1:37:46|The glamorous woman couldn't bear to see the Black-clad Man leave, so she hugged him from behind.
1:37:46|1:37:53|[Black-clad Man] heartlessly pushed away the woman blocking his path, then hammered the door with his hand, consumed by self-blame.
1:37:53|1:37:58|He slowly put down the box, turned around, apologized while explaining to the woman.
1:38:24|1:38:27|The woman sobbed uncontrollably, nodding with tears in her eyes.
1:38:27|1:38:30|The Black-clad Man walked out of the private room carrying a box.
1:38:30|1:38:34|Arriving at the teahouse lobby, it was only then that [Chen Zhihui] was found to have already left.
1:38:34|1:38:37|This is undoubtedly a heavy blow to him.
1:38:37|1:38:44|He scanned the lobby defiantly, hoping that Chen Zhihui was still here.
1:38:44|1:38:48|But after looking around, he still didn't see the figure of [Chen Zhihui].
1:38:48|1:38:52|He closed his eyes as if resigned, walked out of the lobby, and drove away.
1:38:54|1:39:3|What he didn't know was that Chen Zhihui heard the argument in the private room, and thought of himself and Huang Xiuli, who had already left the teahouse.
1:39:3|1:39:16|Inside the private room, the woman saw [Black-clad Man] leaving through the window. Then she wiped away her tears, took out her phone, and resolutely pressed 110.
1:39:16|1:39:23|[Chen Zhihui] once again arrived at the fork outside the teahouse, looking at the two directions on the left and right, still standing there blankly.
1:39:26|1:39:34|And behind him, a car slowly drove in, which was none other than the force driven by [Black-clad Man].
1:39:34|1:39:40|The car drove past Chen Zhihui without slowing down, splashing dirty water directly onto Chen Zhihui's body.
1:39:40|1:39:48|[Chen Zhihui] just lightly brushed off the sewage on his body, but at this moment, his gaze was firm, as if he had made a determined choice.
1:39:55|1:40:6|At 6:30 that evening, in a residential house, two elderly people sat at a set table as if waiting for someone.
1:40:6|1:40:13|The old man sitting in a wheelchair glanced at the time and then said to his old partner.
1:40:51|1:40:59|The two elderly people looked towards the door with hopeful eyes, quietly waiting for the arrival of [Chen Zhihui].
