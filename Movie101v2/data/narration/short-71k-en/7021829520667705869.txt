0:2:33|0:2:40|The man who was wearing a white headscarf and holding a microphone wrapped in red cloth said these words. The surroundings quieted down as he walked through the snow and lifted the door curtain to enter the house.
0:2:59|0:3:4|The snow on the ground has been swept away, a pair of wrapped-up little feet, leaning on a cane, walking slowly.
0:3:4|0:3:9|The grandmother, with a scarf wrapped around her head and holding a scarf around her neck to cover her face, finally arrived in front of the house.
0:3:9|0:3:13|Behind her, a younger auntie helped her open the door.
0:3:13|0:3:18|Through the glass window, you can see the old lady who entered the room sitting on the heated brick bed, taking out a pack of medicine from the medicine box.
0:3:18|0:3:23|The old lady is named [Zhang Xiantu], born in 1926 and passed away in 2015.
0:3:23|0:3:31|She scooped out some pills and put the rest back into the pillbox, then picked up a small medicine bottle, unscrewed the cap and poured it into her palm, but after pouring it several times, nothing came out.
0:3:31|0:3:37|It seems that the medicine bottle is empty. The old lady looks at the bottle and puts the pills in her palm into her mouth.
0:3:37|0:3:42|She, [Ma Dongmei], pursed her lips and swallowed, then turned the medicine bottle upside down, hoping to see if there was any medicine left.
0:3:42|0:3:49|The scene cuts to two side-by-side photos, with the left one showing [Grandpa] holding a cigarette sitting in front of the house, and the right one showing a close-up of [Grandma].
0:3:49|0:3:57|The scene cuts to the old lady sitting on the kang in the room. Her name is [Li Xiumei], born in 1928 and passed away in 2014.
0:3:57|0:4:4|The mouth opened and closed a few times without making a sound, looked out the window, then looked at oneself, and the gaze turned back to the window.
0:4:4|0:4:13|Through the reflection, we can see [Li Xiumei] sitting on the kang, the second hand of the old clock on the wall moving slowly. The screen gradually darkens, and a piece of text appears.
0:4:13|0:4:28|During the 8 years of the Japanese invasion of China, a total of 200,000 Chinese women were forced to serve as comfort women for the Japanese army. Most of the women were either brutally killed or unable to bear the humiliation and committed suicide, with only a small number surviving. The text gradually fades away.
0:4:28|0:4:38|The scene shifts to Jingui Village in Meng County, Shanxi Province, where the dilapidated houses are piled with wire mesh at the door, surrounded by trees and trenches. The low wooden door is half open, with only a corner of the painting left on it.
0:4:38|0:4:47|Through the tomb gate, you can see a tree surrounded by stones in the courtyard, with a cave behind it.
0:5:58|0:6:4|Looking down from above, this former comfort station is now covered with trees and weeds.
0:6:4|0:6:8|In a cave dwelling, the lack of light made the whole room very dark.
0:6:32|0:6:40|Her name is [Pian Huanying], born in 1928. In the dim cave, she pats her cheeks, gently swaying her body, remaining silent.
0:6:40|0:6:46|The scene cuts to another room, where a man in a striped shirt pours water from a bucket into a water tank, then walks out.
0:6:46|0:6:54|Sitting on the kang is an old lady with white hair, next to her is a radio. The old lady is sitting along the edge of the kang holding a book in her hand.
0:6:54|0:7:2|The other hand rubbed her eyes, then put it down and turned a page of the book. She is called [Hao Juxiang], born in 1922 and passed away in 2016.
0:7:2|0:7:7|[Ma Dongmei] sat quietly with her head bowed, her white hair neatly pinned up in an old-fashioned bun.
0:7:7|0:7:12|The scene shifts to a cutting board, where a pair of strong hands is cutting noodles with a knife.
0:7:12|0:7:20|The chopping board was placed on the edge of the heated brick bed, next to the wall, with a pot already on fire. An old lady was sitting on the bed with one leg crossed.
0:7:21|0:7:30|An arm rested on the folded blanket, head bowed playing with the paper in hand. She is called [Wei Shaolan], born in 1931 and passed away in 2016.
0:7:30|0:7:35|Due to old age, [Ma Dongmei] can see the green hands repeatedly folding the paper in her hands, creating creases and smoothing them out.
0:7:36|0:7:46|The scene cuts to another room, where a middle-aged woman is removing the small chairs used as a table from the kang. She drags the chairs with four fingers on each hand, while holding two bowls with her thumbs, and walks out of the door.
0:7:46|0:7:52|The old lady who just finished her meal on the kang is called [Zhao Lanying], born in 1925 and passed away in 2016.
0:7:52|0:7:58|She sat cross-legged with one hand on her leg and the other propped on the heated brick bed, still chewing in her mouth.
0:7:58|0:8:6|On another windowsill, medicine bottles are neatly arranged from low to high, the old lady on the kang is covered with a thin quilt, and she is leaning over to adjust the pillow.
0:8:6|0:8:14|After tidying up, she pulled up the thin blanket and covered herself, placing one hand on her forehead and closing her eyes. Her name is [Liu Gailian], born in 1925.
0:8:14|0:8:23|The old lady's nasal breathing sound accompanied the rise and fall of her body. The scene shifts to outside a house, where a sparrow flies by in the air.
0:8:23|0:8:31|The old lady living here is called [Liu Fenghai], born in 1924 and passed away in 2017. There are two stacks of bricks and some firewood piled up at the door.
0:8:31|0:8:39|The old man lives with his second son and daughter-in-law. He is afraid that his own experiences will bring trouble to their lives, so he does not want to appear on the screen.
0:8:39|0:8:46|The text fades away, and the camera turns to a cave dwelling. The walls inside the cave are painted white, the door is new, and there is even a door curtain added.
0:8:46|0:9:1|An old lady sat by the kang, holding a cup and drinking water. She is called [Cao Heimao], born in 1922. Due to her old age, her eyes are sunken and her mouth is drawn in. Although her forehead is covered with wrinkles, you can still see a fingernail-sized dent.
0:9:1|0:9:17|Outside the house at this moment, a South Korean photographer arrived with two people. The three walked through the courtyard and went straight to the front of the cave dwelling. The South Korean photographer opened the door curtain and walked in, heading straight to [Cao Heimao] who was still on the kang inside the cave. He sat on the edge of the kang, and [Cao Heimao] handed him a cigarette. The translator said to [Cao Heimao]:
0:9:42|0:9:50|Saying that, [Cao Heimao] lit a fire for the Korean photographer, who exhaled a puff of smoke because he couldn't understand Grandma's words.
0:10:12|0:10:17|Grandma looked at the camera and asked if it could be used, wanting the photographer to see if it was different. Then, she showed him the photo on her ID card.
0:10:18|0:10:27|Let the photographer see if he can take a picture. The photographer held a photo in one hand and a camera in the other, and pressed the shutter a few times towards [Grandma Cao Black Hair].
0:10:36|0:10:40|Pointing at the camera, [Ma Dongmei] asked the photographer, "This thing is amazing, right? It can capture everything."
0:10:42|0:10:49|The photographer, unable to understand what the grandmother was saying, could only nod in agreement. The Korean photographer, named [An Shihong], said,
0:11:9|0:11:14|The scene shifts to the Dongning County Social Welfare Institute in Mudanjiang City, Heilongjiang Province. [An Shihong] continues to speak.
0:11:42|0:11:46|So he came to visit these grandmothers. One of the grandmothers in the scene is holding a fake baby doll, she is called [Li Fengyun], born in 1922.
0:11:46|0:11:55|2016年逝世。原名李寿段，是朝鲜人。[Lee Soo-dan]接着说到，尤其中国，是受侵略最大的国家，
0:13:16|0:13:22|The wall has obviously been painted, with dolls dressed in Korean costumes and a map of Korea posted on the wall.
0:13:23|0:13:30|Outside the door, an aunt is washing clothes in a basin.
0:13:51|0:14:0|The narrator is the adopted daughter of [Park Chul-soon], sitting on a bench with her family eating by the cement road outside Grandma [Park Chul-soon]'s house.
0:14:6|0:14:9|The neighbor's child is playing in front of the door by himself.
0:14:10|0:14:20|The narrator's child is on the other side of the door, sitting on a small stool playing with a phone. The mother brings food to her mouth, while the narrator watches her and talks to her.
0:14:24|0:14:36|Park Chul-soon's grandmother walked slowly into the courtyard with her hands behind her back. She stepped up the stairs, pushed aside the blue door curtain at the entrance, and entered the house.
0:14:40|0:14:48|She is now called [Mao Yinmei], born in 1922 and passed away in 2017. Her original name was Park Cheshun, a Korean.
0:15:11|0:15:18|In Grandma Mao Yinmei's room, there are fake flowers prominently displayed, as well as dolls dressed in Korean costumes.
0:17:16|0:17:23|Grandma leaned against the cabinet, recounting stories from her childhood.
0:18:42|0:18:57|From Grandma Mao Yinmei's house, you can see an old man walking towards it. He stops in front of the house, looks at the vegetable garden in front, bends down to touch it with his hands, then hunches his back, lowers his head, and steps sideways to check it.
0:18:58|0:19:12|On the road in front of the steps, a person rode a motorcycle past, with a pair of legs and a bucket of water appearing in front of the camera. It was [Ma Yinzhu]'s adopted daughter returning. She tightly held the rope and carried the shoulder pole into the house.
0:20:10|0:20:30|The adopted daughter of [Ma Yumei] is named [Huang Meirong]. After she finishes cooking in the kitchen, the whole family sits around the dining table eating. Grandma [Ma Yumei] holds a bowl in one hand and picks up a piece of potato with the other hand, chewing it.
0:20:33|0:20:40|The scene shifts to Wuhan, Hubei Province, where a wall is marked with the words "Jiqingli No. 1".
0:20:40|0:20:57|Above the alleyway here, the wires are tangled messily, with clothes hanging outside the windows. In the dim cement corridor, some light shines through the windows. The sound of a horn collecting recyclables can be heard on the street. This is a city that has been invaded.
0:21:0|0:21:17|From October 25th to 27th, 1938, the Japanese invading army successively occupied [Hankou], [Wuchang], and [Hanyang]. After the fall of [Wuhan], the Japanese army massacred Chinese soldiers and civilians in the three towns of [Wuhan], and quickly established more than 20 different types of comfort stations.
0:21:23|0:21:29|Looking up at the top of [Jiqingli], the bright sunlight makes the alley even darker.
0:21:29|0:21:34|The scene shifts to the sky above [Jiqingli], in front of a tall building, with a cluster of low-rise buildings with yellow roofs.
0:21:34|0:21:49|[Hankou Jiqingli] This Japanese comfort station was the first to open on November 8, 1938, with 9 comfort stations operated by brothel owners from Osaka, Kobe, Hiroshima, and other places in Japan, with about 130 Japanese comfort women.
0:22:2|0:22:9|As one of the old lane neighborhoods, [Jiqing Lane] has the largest area, and the residential houses still retain the old heavy and mottled wooden doors.
0:22:9|0:22:18|Now, this relic burdened with heavy historical memories stands out of place in the bustling modern city center.
0:22:18|0:22:34|The scene returns to the grandmother's house of [Ma Yimei], she is sitting in the inner courtyard, looking down at her wrist, pressing it twice and then letting go, sitting up straight, rubbing her arms. Her eyes look up for a while, then look down at her arms.
0:22:35|0:22:46|Facing the camera, [Mao Yinmei] did not look directly at it, but instead gazed off to the side, with wrinkles already covering her face.
0:22:47|0:22:57|Her mouth was muttering, she frowned and turned around, saying:
0:23:38|0:23:46|She repeated these welcoming words, and in the well-preserved site of the comfort station [Jiqingli], such voices had echoed countless times.
0:23:47|0:23:51|The scene shifts from the dim alley in Jiqingli to the bright sunlight next to the civilian house.
0:23:51|0:24:3|Although it was daytime, [Grandma Mao Yinmei] was already lying in bed resting, with the radio playing by her side.
0:24:6|0:24:14|When it came to this point, the adopted daughter [Huang Meirong] paused.
0:24:50|0:24:54|At the doorstep, [Mao Yinmei] sat on a chair, supporting her head with her hand and wiping it.
0:24:54|0:25:6|On the other side, [Ma Dongmei]'s child and the neighbor's child are sitting on chairs, with another girl standing beside them. A younger child runs out from the house, and a woman points to the steps, telling him to go to the girl standing there to get some food.
0:25:6|0:25:13|The child looked at the plastic bag, then ran inside to find the woman who had just left, that is, [Ma Dongmei].
0:25:13|0:25:21|Mom stood inside talking to him, while [Mao Yinmei] watched the child running around, and the child ran to the plastic bag to get food.
0:25:21|0:25:29|After pinching a few, he walked towards [Ma Yinmei] and said as he walked, "Here." [Ma Yinmei] initially thought he wanted the toy in her hand.
0:25:29|0:25:33|[Character] reacted quickly and reached out to catch it, then looked to see what it was.
0:25:33|0:25:37|[Ma Yinmei] placed the toy on her lap and looked at the food in her hand.
0:25:37|0:25:41|The adopted daughter [Huang Meirong] and her husband came out with food to look for her.
0:26:0|0:26:6|In the inner courtyard, [Mao Yinmei] watches her adopted daughter washing clothes.
0:29:54|0:30:2|[Ma Yingmei] sang the Arirang and Bellflower Ballads, both of which are traditional Korean folk songs. The scene shifts to a white building, with the building behind it still under construction.
0:30:4|0:30:12|In the completed building, people have already moved in, and various buckets are piled up in front of the building. This is the Li Autonomous County of Lingshui, Hainan Province.
0:30:12|0:30:20|A red cross is seen under which "This Center Health Clinic" is written. The patient's name is written on the IV drip bag, and the medicine is slowly dripping.
0:30:20|0:30:26|The elderly person lying on the sickbed had one arm placed on their forehead, staring at the ceiling.
0:30:26|0:30:35|Her name is [Chen Yabian], born in 1927 and passed away in 2017, a member of the Li ethnic group. [Chen Yabian] stared at the ceiling for a while.
0:30:35|0:30:42|Closed my eyes and rested. The scene shifted to a forest, this is Baoting Li and Miao Autonomous County in Hainan Province.
0:30:43|0:30:53|A man walked into the woods and knelt down in front of a tombstone.
0:31:47|0:32:3|The scene shifts to the cement windowsill, where we see an elderly woman sitting on a simple bed inside the house. She is [Huang Youliang], born in 1927, a member of the Li ethnic group. The house is built with bricks and cement, without any further decoration.
0:32:3|0:32:11|On the wooden single bed with a canopy, an old woman lies fanning herself with a straw hat. She is called [Chen Liancun], born in 1926.
0:32:28|0:32:34|In another house, an old woman sits. She is called [Fu Meijiu], born in 1928 and passed away in 2017.
0:32:34|0:32:42|Outside the house, a man and a woman are busy by the pool, accidentally dropping a small knife. Hearing the sound, [Fu Meijiu] looks around with concern.
0:32:42|0:32:49|On the other side, an old man walked out of the house, holding a stick as a cane in one hand, and wearing a straw hat on the other hand.
0:33:15|0:33:19|The old man is called [Wang Zhifeng], born in 1928. In a dimly lit room,
0:33:19|0:33:29|An elderly person hunched over, moving slowly step by step, walked to the chair at the door and sat down. Due to her age, she used a cane to support herself with one hand while reaching for the chair with the other hand, very slowly.
0:33:29|0:33:35|Bend down and sit. He is called [Fu Guiying], born in 1919 and passed away in 2015. Another person is outside the room,
0:33:35|0:33:42|A girl is walking on the road, and a woman comes up from below, touching her hair.
0:33:44|0:33:51|The two arrived at a iron gate, this is the home of [Wang Yukai], [Wang Yukai], born in 1920, passed away in 2014.
0:33:51|0:33:58|The woman opened the door and the two walked in.
0:34:21|0:34:29|The girl picked up the notebook on the table and leaned back to read it, while the two of them were talking.
0:35:11|0:35:32|The two sat on the bed, the woman telling the girl about the day [Luo Shanxue] passed away. As she listened, the girl started to cry, and the woman fell silent, reaching her arm to scratch her back. The girl wiped her tears with the back of her hand, and the woman put her hand down and said,
0:35:32|0:36:0|The mouth opened and closed before speaking again: The woman turned her head to look at the bed, and the girl couldn't help but cry again, her back shaking. The woman reached out and touched the girl's arm to comfort her.
0:36:11|0:36:20|The girl recalls the day she learned of the death of [Luo Shanxue].
0:36:28|0:36:35|The woman took out a pile of daily necessities, all of which were bought by the girl for [Luo Shanxue]. The girl turned around crying, picked up these unopened items and looked at them.
0:36:35|0:36:41|The woman turned around and sat back next to him, while the girl turned her face away, wiping tears on the short sleeves.
0:36:41|0:36:46|The woman picked up a bag, unzipped it, and inside was a set of brand new bedding.
0:36:48|0:36:57|Opening the bedsheet, there is a floral pattern printed on it.
0:36:57|0:37:5|The girl also helped to fully spread out the bedsheet.
0:37:32|0:37:37|In the house where [Luo Shanxue] used to live, the girl is recounting what she knows.
0:37:37|0:37:43|The scene shifts to Lingshui County, Hainan Province, where a not-so-wide cement road is lined with sparsely planted rows of trees.
0:37:43|0:37:48|The cement road extends to the outside road, with a narrow stream separating the yard from the road.
0:37:49|0:37:54|Vice director of the Nanbao Town Nursing Home, [Liang Chaosheng], rode a tricycle into the courtyard.
0:38:23|0:38:32|In the scene, an old man moves a chair outside and sits down.
0:38:34|0:38:39|Her name is [Lin Ailan], born in 1925 and passed away in 2015.
0:38:39|0:38:46|Through the security net, one can see the old man's white hair with a black headband on top, as he just exerted some effort to move his chair outward.
0:38:46|0:38:55|Sitting down, she was still breathing somewhat rapidly. [Lin Ailan]'s grandmother's eyes had sunken deeply, she licked her rapidly trembling lips.
0:38:55|0:39:4|Her bed in the room is covered with a bamboo mat, and next to the pillow are two small daggers. The fan is spinning towards the door, and the wall next to it is crawling with bugs.
0:39:4|0:39:12|Outside the door, [Grandma Lin Ailan] slightly leaned her body, with her arms resting on the armrest of the chair, crossing her legs as she sat outside.
0:40:2|0:40:10|In the battle in Haikou, two Japanese devils were killed. They had machine guns hanging on their bodies and pistols in their hands, all loaded with bullets. The grandmother pointed to her own head and said,
0:40:10|0:40:15|There is a hole here, the bullet just grazed by, almost lost my life.
0:40:15|0:40:18|In the nursing home, a shirtless man calls someone over to drink.
0:40:48|0:40:53|The seated man extended a hand, gesturing with a palm about that size, not very big.
0:40:53|0:41:0|The boy is so small and eats so little, it's not even enough for me. The man with bare arms imitates him and gestures with one hand.
0:41:0|0:41:7|Three cups of wine are not enough for me to drink. Grandmother [Wei Shaolan] smiled as she listened to this, and the man no longer insisted on drinking more.
0:41:7|0:41:16|Later, the man rode away on his bicycle.
0:42:11|0:42:16|The man who was just talking to [Wei Shaolan]'s grandmother is Yan Xuezhan, a retired teacher from Nanbao Town.
0:42:16|0:42:24|On the other side, [Grandma Wei Shaolan] had returned to the house and was sitting on a stool, peeling fruit. A dustpan was placed next to the chair, and the peeled fruit skins were dropping directly into it.
0:42:24|0:42:26|Gradually, [Ma Dongmei] started coughing while peeling.
0:42:26|0:42:39|In the nursing home, several elderly people sit by the wall at the door chatting. An elderly man in a white short-sleeved shirt enters Grandma [Wei Shaolan]'s room. Grandma asks him how many photos he has taken after filming for so long.
0:43:8|0:43:16|"No theft, found it." She said as she showed her grandmother the things in her hand, and then took out a red medal box to show her. The old lady scolded her.
0:45:5|0:45:14|Tied up and thrown into the river. Gesturing with both hands to show being tied up, as she spoke, the grandmother's voice choked up and she lowered her head.
0:45:15|0:45:17|Covering her eyes with her hands, her chin trembling.
0:45:26|0:45:35|The one who captured my mother was a Japanese soldier. Grandma blinked her eyes, her features wrinkled together, she held her head down with her hands, unable to help but cry.
0:45:35|0:45:41|The character first breathed rapidly through the mouth, then the whole body started shaking visibly due to intense emotions.
0:45:41|0:45:50|The grandmother fell silent in front of the camera, never showing her eyes. The bright Hainan sunlight filtered through the leaves of the nursing home.
0:45:50|0:45:57|6 elderly people, with 4 sitting together and 2 sitting at the door of their respective rooms, all sitting on the same red stool.
0:45:57|0:46:11|On the other side, [Grandma Wei Shaolan] sat sideways in her chair with a backrest, the color fading and turning white. Her coat was draped over the arm of the chair, and she held a radio in her hand playing traditional opera inside.
0:46:11|0:46:15|Grandma looks at the radio in her hand and sings along with it.
0:46:15|0:46:21|In the sky, the clouds roll and unfold, in the quiet nursing home, the voice on the radio is strong and powerful.
0:46:22|0:46:29|The scene cuts back to the room, with [Wei Shaolan] sitting on a chair, recounting her youth.
0:46:47|0:46:59|[Wei Shaolan]'s cheeks trembled slightly, she turned her head slightly and continued: "On the surface, it seems like I oppose him after marrying him," pausing for a moment, [Wei Shaolan] said:
0:47:8|0:47:14|The Japanese man crippled me, and he died. On that day, [Wei Shaolan] supported and pulled with both hands, grabbing the armrest of the chair.
0:47:14|0:47:19|Wearing a pair of equally faded slippers on his feet, he slowly moved towards the outside of the house step by step.
0:47:20|0:47:23|A bunch of keys is hanging on the chair, swaying with every movement.
0:47:23|0:47:27|The vice director of the nursing home [Luo Shanxue] sat in the courtyard and said:
0:47:58|0:48:10|Because she was tortured by the Japanese to the point of disability, [Wei Shaolan] grandmother's daily routine involved moving in and out with the help of a chair. As Vice Dean [Luo Shanxue] put it, at mealtime, a female nurse walked out of the restaurant with a bowl of rice in her hand.
0:48:10|0:48:16|Walking down the steps, [Wei Shaolan] slowly made her way to Grandma's room, calling out as she walked, "Time for dinner."
0:48:16|0:48:27|After walking to the door, [Ma Dongmei] placed the bowl in her hand on the stool by the door. After putting down the bowl, she carefully moved the stool a bit outward, then adjusted the bowl, said a few words to Grandma [Wei Shaolan] inside the house, and walked in.
0:48:27|0:48:33|During mealtime, [Grandma Wei] and an elderly neighbor sat on the front steps eating their meals separately.
0:48:33|0:48:42|Grandma did not bend over, but propped up her knee with one hand, and reached the spoon into the bowl on the stool with the other hand. Retired teacher Yan Xuezhan then said:
0:49:24|0:49:38|After finishing speaking, [Grandma] curved her fingers and propped them beside her cheek. After taking a deep breath, she fell silent again, her eyes looking in one direction, lost in memories and thoughts. [Grandma] blinked her eyes, with her chest rising and falling noticeably.
0:49:38|0:49:45|After a moment of silence, Grandma's lips moved twice, indicating that she didn't want to talk about it anymore.
0:49:48|0:49:56|Saying that, [Grandma] ran her hand across her cheek, then under her nose, and finally up to her forehead. At night, half of the moon was already covered by dark clouds.
0:49:56|0:49:59|Still moving towards the remaining half.
0:50:0|0:50:8|The next day it rained, and [Grandma Wei Shaolan] could only sit in the house watching the rain outside, the wind blowing her white hair by her temples.
0:50:9|0:50:15|In the dimly lit room, Grandma sat with her head down, and the lightning flashed twice.
0:50:20|0:50:28|Hearing a sound, [Grandma] lifted her head and looked outside again. Raindrops fell on the window sill with a security net, splashing water continuously.
0:50:28|0:50:43|Grandma turned the chair from facing the door to facing outside, then bent down to pick up the fallen stick. She placed it against the door, stood up with the support of the chair's armrests, moved the chair into the room, sat down, and picked up the stick next to her.
0:50:43|0:50:49|The large raindrops fell delicately on the windowsill, the rain getting heavier and heavier, with no lights on in the room.
0:50:49|0:50:56|[Grandma Lin Ailan] backed into the room, closed the door, wiped her face with a towel, and leaned against the stick next to the door, falling to the ground.
0:50:56|0:51:5|Grandma bent down while closing the door tightly, picked up a stick and leaned it diagonally against the door. There was a narrow gap on the door, through which a faint light shone.
0:51:5|0:51:18|Outside, the rain started pouring down heavily. The doors of the nursing home were all closed. Turning to the entrance of the nursing home, in the empty courtyard, there were only the open iron gates and the pouring rain. Through a door, a glimpse of an old-fashioned building could be seen.
0:51:18|0:51:25|The roof is made of tiles, with three red envelopes pasted on the door. The rain here is not heavy, but it is drizzling.
0:51:25|0:51:32|An elderly person sits by the door inside the house, watching the rain outside, with arms resting on their legs and hands rubbing together in the middle.
0:51:32|0:51:39|The old woman is called [Wei Shaolan], born in 1926. Following her gaze, you can see that the house in front is already very old.
0:51:39|0:51:46|The bricks and mud of the house have large gaps between them, and a few wooden sticks placed together barely pass as a door.
0:51:46|0:51:51|After the rain, the puddles on the ground reflected the shadows of the trees and the sun.
0:51:51|0:52:0|The droplets from the tree gently fell onto the accumulated water, creating ripples. The sky over Chengmai County, Hainan Province, was as clear as can be, with large white clouds slowly drifting by.
0:52:0|0:52:7|Behind the roof, you can still see the distinctive coconut trees. In the simple house, [Grandma Wei Shaolan] is busy bending over on the ground.
0:52:7|0:52:15|Two legs, one with a rolled-up pant leg higher than the other, support the body. He straightens his back and walks towards the low wooden stool in the middle of the room.
0:52:15|0:52:23|Bend the knees, pull the chair forward. After sitting down, pick up the bowl in front of the table, stir it with chopsticks, and then put the rice into the mouth.
0:53:5|0:53:13|Without firewood, she went out to find some firewood to cook. In the scene, [Grandma Li Meijin] was still sitting on a stool with a bowl of food.
0:53:13|0:53:20|The rice was almost finished, and Grandma even placed the bowl near her mouth to scrape it with chopsticks, making sure not to waste any food.
0:53:20|0:53:29|In the afternoon outdoors, the sunlight was blocked by an old tree, and under the tree sat [Grandma Li Meijin] among the people enjoying the cool breeze.
0:53:29|0:53:38|On the stone table, there is a water kettle, cups, and a child playing nearby. [Grandma Li Meijin] is playing cards with others on a sturdy wooden table.
0:53:38|0:53:44|A few neighbors sat together chatting, with one person constantly waving a fan in their hand.
0:53:46|0:53:56|A woman holding a cup temporarily walks away, [Grandma Li Meijin] and the person at the same table successively pick up a card, the leisurely people's heads are visible in the sunlight shining through the leaves.
0:53:57|0:54:6|Night fell in the blink of an eye, with streetlights shining like the moon hanging in the sky, and the dust in the air visible in the light.
0:54:6|0:54:14|After the birds' daytime chirping, children's laughter, and people's casual conversations gradually quieted down, [Grandma Li Meijin] began to recount her experiences from her youth.
0:55:6|0:55:8|Isn't the tip of their gun a knife?
0:55:8|0:55:21|In the scene, a knife swiftly chops towards a coconut, an adult's hand is holding a jackfruit to peel, and two children are also using knives to peel the jackfruit. Under the same tree, an old man wearing a straw hat watches as people are busy.
0:55:21|0:55:37|Before long, a row of pineapples was displayed. The man picked out the clean ones in plastic bags, while the elderly person at the table poured coconut juice into a basin. The child held a coconut and drank straight from it, while the little girl squatted on the ground and gnawed on one. An old lady held a piece of coconut shell and handed it to the old man sitting by the tree.
0:57:44|0:57:56|From outside, you can see that [Luo Shanxue]'s grandmother lives in a self-built one-story building with white walls covered with tiles, and a rope is pulled up at the edge for drying clothes. Inside the house, [Luo Shanxue]'s grandmother and her family are having a meal.
0:58:40|0:58:47|In the bright sunlight, [Grandma Luo Shanxue] stood at the door, continuously pumping water while fiddling with her hands.
0:58:48|0:58:57|With Grandma pressing down, water kept flowing into the bucket. After nearly half a bucket of water was drawn, Grandma lifted the handle and moved the bucket, then slowly squatted down.
0:58:58|0:59:8|After rinsing the clothes in the bucket twice, she took them out and placed them on the floor to scrub. She leaned against one leg, vigorously rubbing with both hands.
0:59:9|0:59:18|The yellow dog behind walked into the room, the foam from washing clothes gradually increased on the bluestone floor, and the water in the bucket also decreased a bit.
0:59:19|0:59:21|[Grandma Luo Shanxue]'s voice rang out again,
1:0:18|1:0:28|That day, there was a young man chopping meat by the roadside. He held a knife in each hand, one to fix the meat and the other to chop.
1:0:28|1:0:35|A woman hears the sound of chopping meat, covers her ears and stands up to move away a bit. Sitting next to her is an old man watching.
1:0:35|1:0:40|The person who was cooling off also cast a sidelong glance. One person even walked behind the young man.
1:0:40|1:0:44|Look. [Grandma Luo] was sitting not far behind the young man.
1:0:45|1:0:59|He leaned his arm on the armrest, with a silver bracelet slipped down to the middle of his forearm, fingers clenched into a fist resting beside his cheek, slightly turned to look at the young man. When they were on the mountain, [Luo Shanxue]'s grandmother wore a straw hat, bent over to chop some firewood.
1:1:24|1:1:31|In the scene, [Grandma Luo Shanxue] picks up the chopped firewood and looks around to find more wood to continue chopping.
1:1:48|1:1:54|When the husband was old, he had a stroke. After chopping the firewood, [Grandma Luo] used tree branches to tie the firewood into a bundle.
1:2:21|1:2:29|[Grandma Luo Shanxue] sat in front of a low stool, lighting dry leaves on fire and then stuffing them into the firewood pile, before going to the cutting board to chop vegetables.
1:2:53|1:3:9|Grandma picked up the cutting board, poured the vegetables into the pot, stirred them a few times with a spatula, placed the cutting board on the table behind her, the fire under the pot burned more vigorously, smoke rising from the pot, rushing towards [Luo Shanxue] Grandma's face. After stirring for a while, a simple meal was ready.
1:3:9|1:3:16|In the shabby kitchen, the rice cooker lid reflects the sunlight, and a rice ladle rests along the edge of the pot on the table.
1:3:29|1:3:52|In a dimly lit room, a beam of light shines through a circular hole in the wall, faintly revealing a dusty mooncake box hanging on the wall. Dust particles and lingering smoke float in the beam of light as Grandma [Luo Shanxue] sits next to the table, taking out a coin from her pocket and placing it on the table to play cards with the old man across from her.
1:4:18|1:4:20|The camera turns to the mural on the wall.
1:4:20|1:4:28|One picture shows Chairman Mao giving a speech, the other shows Chairman Mao standing in front of a pine tree. Every household in our village has a photo of Chairman Mao hanging on the wall.
1:4:28|1:4:36|[Grandma Li Meijin] said so. Next to the calendar with Chairman Mao's portrait, there are several large photo frames with family photos pasted on them.
1:4:37|1:4:43|In the frame is a black and white photo of a mother holding a child, along with an old-fashioned personal ID photo with a lace border.
1:4:43|1:4:51|There are individual color photos of children, and a family color group photo. Various calendars are pasted on the mottled wall.
1:4:51|1:4:54|On the table next to the corner of the wall is a tablecloth with red checkers.
1:4:56|1:5:4|A framed picture hangs directly above the table, with a grandmother wearing a vest bending over in front of the table, tidying up something underneath.
1:5:4|1:5:12|Her name is [Li Ailian], born in 1928. After tidying up, she leaned on the chair at the table and moved to the other side.
1:5:14|1:5:20|The camera pans to the outside of the house, where the old wooden door is no longer usable and has been replaced with bricks.
1:5:21|1:5:26|This is Wuxiang County, Changzhi City, Shanxi Province.
1:5:44|1:5:48|Ask her if her leg still hurts, if she has taken any medicine, and if she can walk.
1:5:48|1:6:3|The woman walked by talking on the phone. There was a blackboard on the wall indoors, with pinyin written at the top, followed by numbers for comparison, arithmetic questions, and the recognition of the whole syllables of the mother rhyme. This woman is the daughter-in-law of Li Ailian, [Li Xiuping].
1:6:41|1:6:48|[Li Xiuping] paused and rubbed his hands in front of his nose.
1:7:37|1:7:45|Li Ailian sat on the kang and said, [Li Xiuping] lifted the door curtain and walked out. After speaking, [Li Xiuping] walked away.
1:7:46|1:8:3|In the room without the lights on, only the light from the door and windows, [Grandma Li Ailian] sat on the kang leaning against the blanket, one leg stretched out, one leg bent, constantly rubbing her face with both hands, then looking out the window.
1:8:4|1:8:17|Through the window, you can see that it is starting to rain outside. The two windows above are still open inward, and [Grandma Li Ailian] is rubbing her chin, bowing her head in silence.
1:8:18|1:8:28|The sudden sound of thunder made her look up and gaze out the window.
1:8:31|1:8:36|After the fighting stops and the Japanese surrender, he finally comes back on his own without causing any more trouble.
1:8:37|1:8:43|The rain outside the window is still falling, dripping onto the wire, forming droplets hanging down, and then falling slowly.
1:8:43|1:8:50|[Li Ailian's grandmother] cried by the bedside, choked for a moment, and continued to speak:
1:8:58|1:9:20|It was probably the husband comforting himself at the time. The more grandma talked, the sadder she became, shaking her head and whispering that she couldn't go on. After taking a deep breath, she picked up the tissue in her hand, gestured and said, "After I finish, she placed the unfolded tissue on her face with both hands, slowly lowered her head, and pressed her index finger against her forehead."
1:9:20|1:9:24|Outside the window, the rain is still falling, and raindrops are dripping down from the eaves.
1:9:28|1:9:34|The rain was very fine and soft, but the raindrops falling from the eaves were falling heavily.
1:9:34|1:9:44|Indoors, [Li Ailian]'s grandmother was still quietly crying, accompanied by thunder, the scene gradually darkened.
1:9:45|1:9:49|The next day, the crops in the cornfield were growing well, and the sun was shining.
1:9:50|1:9:53|There is a layer of dense thin clouds in the sky.
1:9:53|1:10:0|[Li Ailian]'s grandmother was busy in the kitchen, cutting green onions with a knife and putting them into a bowl, then she lifted the lid of the pot to check the situation inside.
1:10:1|1:10:8|Seeing that the water was boiling, [Ma Dongmei] picked up the ladle filled with cold water and added some more.
1:10:40|1:10:53|[Ma Dongmei] cut another tomato, then grabbed some noodles from a plastic bag and threw them into the pot. She stirred with chopsticks, then poured in the freshly cut tomatoes, quickly stirred again, covered the pot, and added two corn cobs into the fire.
1:10:53|1:10:59|Before long, [Grandma Li Ailian] sat at the table and started eating noodles by herself.
1:11:56|1:12:3|She sat on the heated brick bed and said she wouldn't mention the past.
1:12:3|1:12:10|The interviewer came, but didn't tell the truth. In the yard, [Grandma Li Ailian] stood under a tree, next to some vegetables she had planted, and suddenly saw a cat.
1:12:23|1:12:39|Daughter-in-law [Li Xiuping] heard the sound and walked over. She saw a cat trying to enter the house, so she quickly shouted and then pretended to approach, scaring the cat away from the door. She then walked back, bent down to pick some vegetables, and after picking enough, she held them with both hands and placed them aside.
1:13:35|1:13:50|Several cats lay outside the door meowing. [Li Ailian Grandma] leaned against the door frame and stepped out. She broke the food in her hand and threw it on the ground. The cats immediately ran over to eat, and Grandma smiled.
1:14:2|1:14:7|Grandma asked why the cat didn't bring the child to eat together, and the other foot also stepped out of the door frame.
1:14:8|1:14:18|Returning to the room, the TV was already on. [Li Ailian's grandmother] sat on the kang, then slowly moved to the edge of the bed, took something from the windowsill, held it in her hand, and sat back down.
1:14:18|1:14:23|A television set is placed on the cabinet, playing an old movie.
1:14:23|1:14:30|Above the television, there is a cabinet with a sliding door. The camera then pans to the front of the television.
1:14:30|1:14:40|A boy is leaning on his elbows on the table, staring at the TV. Since the table is a bit far from the heated brick bed, the boy chooses to stand closer to watch TV.
1:14:41|1:14:50|[Grandma Li Ailian] on the kang leaned against the quilt, one leg crossed over the other, hands crossed in front, smiling and looking at the boy.
1:14:50|1:14:57|Grandma lowered her head, lifted one leg slightly, pulled the pants leg, and then moved her leg to the other side.
1:14:58|1:15:10|In this way, with both hands placed neatly on the knees and fingers interlocked, [Grandma] unconsciously shakes her legs, obviously feeling quite happy.
1:15:40|1:15:56|In the scene, [Grandma Li Ailian] is carrying a bucket, slowly stepping over the wooden gate, walking to the faucet, and turning on the tap to fill the bucket with water. As night falls, a cat is lying on the roof, and through the windows and doors of [Grandma Li Ailian]'s house, a yellow light can be seen.
1:16:8|1:16:14|The wardrobe is half frosted glass and half mirrored.
1:16:14|1:16:22|We can see [Grandma Li Ailian] on the kang stretching her legs to rest, the scene then shifts to a lotus pond with many low hills in the distance.
1:16:22|1:16:30|In the county of Lipu, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, a local grandmother sits by the door of a house, fanning herself.
1:16:30|1:16:33|On the other side, an old man is talking to a girl.
1:16:33|1:16:40|The old man rolled up his pants legs, hands resting on his knees, gesturing as he spoke, one hand holding a cigarette.
1:16:40|1:16:48|The girl is a reporter from a magazine in Beijing, nodding frequently as she listens, while a tricycle drives past the door.
1:16:48|1:16:54|The man being interviewed is called [Luo Shanxue], born in 1945, of Chinese-Japanese descent.
1:17:24|1:17:29|The camera pans to the uneven ground, showing the feet of three people. A line of text appears on the screen.
1:17:29|1:17:34|Due to his identity, 70-year-old [Luo Shanxue] has remained single and unable to find a wife.
1:17:38|1:17:51|The reporter mentioned that a volunteer was helping [Luo Shanxue] find a wife. [Luo Shanxue] shook his head while smoking, and both of them laughed. The reporter was jotting down notes in his notebook, while a photographer was taking pictures of the grandma by the door.
1:17:51|1:18:2|Grandma was already sitting on a worn-out sofa, with a chair next to her serving as a table, on which there was a rice cooker and bowls. Another table next to the sofa had a brand-new fan on it.
1:18:2|1:18:8|Grandma sat on the sofa, crossed her legs and held a bowl, eating in front of the photographer's camera.
1:18:8|1:18:16|The grandmother is called [Wei Shaolan], born in 1920, a member of the Yao ethnic group. Flies were crawling on the rice cooker and around the bowls on the table, but no one paid any attention.
1:18:16|1:18:24|[Grandma Wei] held a bowl and kept putting rice into her mouth, using chopsticks to push it in bit by bit when it was at the edge of her mouth.
1:18:24|1:18:34|In another courtyard, a person is sunning a quilt on a pile of bricks. In front of a wall made of cement bricks, on a wooden sofa, an old woman sits hunched over, breaking something in her hands.
1:18:34|1:18:40|Accidentally dropped a piece, searching for it on her own pants. The camera slowly moves up, revealing information about the old woman, her name is [He Yuzhen], born in 1921.
1:18:42|1:18:48|[Ma Dongmei] passed away in 2014. A small hole in the roof let in a beam of light into the dark room.
1:18:48|1:18:55|The man who went to sweep the tomb for [Huang Yufeng] appears on the screen again.
1:19:25|1:19:31|The man sat in the woods where the tombstone was and finished his speech.
1:19:31|1:19:35|This man is called [Chen Houzhi], he is an employee at the farm.
1:19:35|1:19:42|Since 1996, he has been helping the victims in Hainan. After speaking, he took out his phone and flipped open the phone cover.
1:19:42|1:19:50|After dialing the phone, he held it to his face and spoke in Hainan dialect to the person on the other end, with the trees and grass swaying in the wind behind him.
1:19:50|1:19:52|In the woods on the other side.
1:19:52|1:20:5|The girl who went to [Wang Yukai]'s grandmother's house used a lighter to light the paper money, with some incense sticks inserted in front. The folded paper money was difficult to ignite, and the girl tried several times.
1:20:56|1:21:4|The burning joss paper was finally ignited, emitting smoke.
1:21:4|1:21:13|The girl squatted on the ground with her chin resting on her hands, then stood up, poured out the wine from the bottle, and walked down the mountain carrying a black bag.
1:21:13|1:21:19|An old man carrying a shoulder pole passed by and glanced at her. The woman behind the old man was carrying a basket.
1:21:19|1:21:28|The old man took two steps and then turned around to look at the girl.
1:22:19|1:22:25|In the mountains, the incense has burned out and the paper money is reduced to ashes.
1:22:40|1:22:46|Her name is [Mitan Mai], a Japanese exchange student who has been helping the victims in Hainan since 2009.
1:22:47|1:22:51|Mai Tianmai's figure gradually blurred, leaving only the grass swaying slightly at the edge of the field.
1:22:52|1:23:1|At the beginning of the film, the man giving a speech at the funeral walks into a room, rubbing his hands.
1:23:9|1:23:16|Sitting on the kang in the room was an old man, with a thin blanket covering his legs.
