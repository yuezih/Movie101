0:0:51|0:0:57|[Old Li] brought food and poured it into the cat's bowl, gently stroking the cat's body. The cat alertly dodged for a moment.
0:0:59|0:1:4|Seeing the kitten eating eagerly, [Old Li] sat up straight and shouted back into the house.
0:1:6|0:1:29|A Samoyed slowly stuck out its body, while Lai Xi hastened its pace and ran straight towards [Old Li]. Lai Xi stared solemnly at the kitten, which arched its back in response.
0:1:47|0:1:56|Lai Xi raised his front paws, [Old Li] carried the kitten into the house, while Lai Xi closely followed [Old Li]'s steps.
0:1:58|0:2:6|Several neighbors gathered around the table inside the house, playing mahjong.
0:2:58|0:3:26|Four elderly people left the mahjong table chatting and laughing, while Xi lay lazily in the sun at the door. [Old Li] sat quietly in the living room, the background noise from the TV was a bit loud. He got up to turn off the TV, then began to tidy up the messy mahjong table as usual. His heavy clothes made his movements a bit awkward, and he slowly walked to the door with a somewhat vacant expression.
0:3:26|0:3:32|He took off his reading glasses and looked up at the sky, where fireworks suddenly burst, breaking the silence of the county town. The scene shifted,
0:3:34|0:3:36|The opening part of the movie ends.
0:3:36|0:3:48|The film tells the generation gap issue between three generations of a family. The daughter, who has been living in Beijing for 14 years, returns to her hometown with her granddaughter who studied in the United States after learning about her father's early signs of Alzheimer's disease.
0:4:4|0:4:8|The story, which is both funny and touching, unexpectedly unfolds from this reunion.
0:4:9|0:4:21|Director Gao Qunshu expressed that the creation of this film is to convey true emotions. He has always wanted to shoot a comedy, but not the kind with only jokes. He wants to present the audience with a funny and heartwarming movie.
0:4:21|0:4:32|The New Year should be full of joy and harmony. The film starts with a very small point, unfolding visually with a small family, but the scale presented is very large.
0:4:32|0:4:42|The film reveals the changes in social relationships, conflicts between the old and the new, and collisions of various emerging cultures. It not only allows the audience to feel the long-lost atmosphere of the past, but also enables them to reexamine their surrounding lives.
0:4:44|0:4:53|The theme of celebrating the Chinese New Year ultimately boils down to everyone getting along. The film does not blindly follow trends, but instead infuses the movie with comedic charm through its language.
0:4:55|0:5:9|The charm of the lines brings people back to the most traditional New Year's films. The whole story is full of humor, and in creating dramatic conflicts, the story of the film also twists and turns, various contradictions come together, finally making the audience burst into laughter.
0:5:9|0:5:15|The film adopts a segmented narrative structure, with a total of 5 acts. The first act starts at Old Li's hometown.
0:5:33|0:5:38|The festive atmosphere warms up the small town in winter.
0:5:38|0:5:48|On the other hand, the courtyard guarded by [Old Li] appeared even more desolate. Slowly pushing a handcart, [Old Li] walked out from the house and soon arrived at the market.
0:6:30|0:6:42|[Old Li] walked while waving his hand, sighing at the clever tricks of the street vendors, and continued to move forward. A person with a kitchen knife in hand and wearing headphones,
0:6:42|0:6:59|The emotional singing of the female boss caught the attention of [Old Li]. She sang with great passion, lost in her own voice, completely unaware of [Old Li]'s gaze. [Old Li] carefully observed the female boss, and when he was deeply moved, he couldn't help but applaud.
0:9:48|0:9:55|After the female boss finished speaking and made a gesture of invitation, she started singing a song to herself.
0:9:55|0:10:4|Ignoring [Old Li], she exuded the air of an opera soprano. [Old Li] shouted in anger,
0:10:4|0:10:14|Both of them stood still, deciding not to buy the chicken after all. [Old Li] remained silent, with an angry expression on his face, as he walked away pushing the small cart. The female boss shouted after him.
0:10:14|0:10:20|Continuing to sing, perhaps it was too pleasant to resist applauding for oneself.
0:10:20|0:10:36|Old Li arrived at the entrance of the market in the blink of an eye. A delivery van whizzed past him, followed closely by an electric bike. Startled, he took two steps back, looked up to check the traffic, then resumed walking after confirming it was safe.
0:10:36|0:10:52|The brightly dressed yangko dance troupe passed by, but [Old Li] was too busy to appreciate it. He hurriedly crossed the road and reached the other side, where the festive music brought a smile to his face, only to quickly disappear.
0:10:52|0:11:4|The bus slowly pulls into the station from a distance, and [Old Li] looks back at the departing yangko dance troupe with a hint of nostalgia. The bus stops, and [Old Li] also gets on, heading home.
0:11:5|0:11:9|During the Chinese New Year, the traffic in Beijing was still bustling.
0:12:10|0:12:16|[Li Yangduo] sat in the car, watching as Siqi pushed her luggage to catch the plane. Her expression was serious, and her eyes seemed a bit absent-minded.
0:12:16|0:12:25|Watching Siqi slowly walk past the car, she pursed her lips but ultimately didn't call out. She parked the car and entered the airport lobby.
0:13:6|0:13:14|The scene cuts to the county town, where [Old Li] stands on the platform of the train station, craning his neck to look at the train pulling in, while the police officer [Shen Qiang] strides quickly towards him.
0:15:28|0:15:32|[Li Yangduo] listened without saying a word, turned on the turn signal and drove towards the ramp.
0:15:38|0:15:44|[Zhu Li] let out a long howl to the sky, then called her friend to vent.
0:16:24|0:16:32|With a loud crash, the mother and daughter stopped fighting. [Li Yangduo] covered her mouth with her hand and quickly got off the car to check the situation.
0:17:17|0:17:30|[Li Yangduo] hurried back to the car to get money, [Zhu Li] took the opportunity to slip away, [Li Yangduo] quickly rushed towards [Zhu Li] and grabbed her.
0:17:39|0:18:0|The camera follows the music back to Shimen County town, where in a black and white slow-motion scene, a teddy bear with perked ears aimlessly runs on the street. Beside it is the owner, a young woman from the town, running freely with spring couplets in her hands, her face filled with a happy smile.
0:18:2|0:18:8|Teddy followed his owner's steps closely, occasionally looking up at them, while the couplet swayed in the wind.
0:18:8|0:18:17|Life in the county town is as leisurely and relaxed as ever. At this moment, inside [Shen Qiang]'s police car,
0:19:16|0:19:21|Shen Qiang slammed on the brakes.
0:19:23|0:19:34|Accompanied by cheerful music, three stylish urban beauties appear in the field of vision, linking arms and running forward, perhaps the most beautiful scenery is just like this.
0:19:34|0:19:40|The sudden sound of firecrackers interrupted this beautiful moment.
0:19:43|0:19:51|The farce ends with the music, and the film moves to the second act. The streets of Shimen County town are deserted.
0:19:51|0:19:56|Only Old Li, the sanitation worker, was still working, with various small cars parked on both sides of the road.
0:19:56|0:20:4|[Zhu Li] has returned to her hometown with [Li Yangduo], holding her phone and constantly changing directions to find a signal, with a slightly anxious expression.
0:20:13|0:20:25|She touched her chest, coming to her senses from the shock just now, and walked into a van filled with goods. The boss [Xiao Tian] was wearing headphones and staring at the computer screen, laughing foolishly.
0:21:21|0:21:42|In the room, [Li Yangduo] and [Old Li] sat facing each other. [Old Li] was breathing heavily, perhaps feeling uncomfortable under his daughter's sharp gaze. After speaking, he took off his hat and touched his face.
0:24:21|0:24:52|Without looking back, [Old Li] entered the bedroom and shouted inside. After a long time without a response, he seemed a little impatient, stood up abruptly from the sofa and walked towards the bedroom, but every two steps he stopped in his tracks.
0:26:0|0:26:9|The music fades out, and the film enters the third act. [Old Li] is already busy in the kitchen. Despite his old age, his knife skills are still sharp.
0:26:9|0:26:32|Old Li skillfully sliced the ginger and scallions, cut various ingredients into different sizes, put them in containers of various sizes for later use, grabbed a fish in his hand, quickly cleaned the scales off the fish, and made various cuts of different depths on the fish's back. There were also some uncommon ingredients like sea cucumber and abalone among the ingredients.
0:26:33|0:26:42|Outside the kitchen, [Li Yangduo] has put up festive couplets inside and outside the house, with big lanterns hanging from the eaves.
0:26:54|0:27:0|Li Yangduo went straight to the kitchen after finishing his work.
0:27:19|0:27:26|[Li Yangduo] put down her left hand and slowly raised her right hand, staring at [Old Li] in surprise.
0:28:12|0:28:27|The chopsticks kept stirring in the pot, the food rolling in the boiling oil, [Old Li] nervously staring at the stove, afraid that his daughter might make a mistake again.
0:28:29|0:28:36|Before long, the food was ready, and [Old Li] picked up a piece to taste.
0:32:10|0:32:16|The camera cuts to the outside of the house with the music playing, [Zhu Li] is sitting excitedly in front of the computer.
0:32:44|0:33:3|Xiao Tian was busy unloading and didn't have time to pay attention to her. At this moment, Zhu Li's good friend passed by, and Zhu Li hurriedly came out to greet her.
0:34:9|0:34:17|Old Li heard the sound and entered the house.
0:34:58|0:35:6|But they were blocked by three big men carrying gifts.
0:35:43|0:35:49|[Da Hai] stood still, looking somewhat unnatural, and took off his reflective sunglasses.
0:39:32|0:39:38|[Zhu Li] kissed [Da Hai], which made [Old Li] immediately anxious.
0:41:31|0:41:35|Old Li burped right after he finished speaking.
0:41:48|0:41:55|[Old Li] looked at everyone with a dazed expression,
0:43:27|0:43:35|[Da Hai] was asked a question and seemed a bit stunned, for a moment he didn't know how to answer.
0:45:27|0:45:39|[Xiao Mi] made a gesture of 10 and mouthed the word "million". As the music played, the lively atmosphere in the small house came to an end. In Donggaoliang Hutong, the daily lives of the extraordinary people continued.
0:46:2|0:46:5|Passing by Xiao Tian's small convenience store van, Xiao Tian heard the sound and stealthily followed behind the goddess Zhu Li.
0:46:26|0:46:34|The goddess glanced at [Xiao Tian] running away, then immersed herself in her own world and looked ahead.
0:46:35|0:46:47|The familiar music played again, firecrackers exploded in the van, and [Zhu Li] approached.
0:47:31|0:47:39|[Zhu Li] felt a bit embarrassed, but still accepted the three cigarettes, then left without looking back.
0:48:3|0:48:11|The sudden shout caught the goddess off guard, but she quickly recovered and the two warmly offered their blessings. Act Four.
0:48:11|0:48:30|Time flew by and it was already afternoon. The setting sun brought a hint of warmth to the small town. [Old Li] was still busy in the kitchen, rhythmically chopping the minced meat on the cutting board with a knife. He quickly rolled the long dough into a small lump, flattened it with a rolling pin, and filled it with plenty of minced meat.
0:48:30|0:48:37|With a strong pinch of both hands, the dumplings were quickly spread out on the table. [Li Yangduo] sat on the sofa in the room.
0:48:37|0:48:44|Boredly holding a water cup to pass the time, I casually looked up and found [Zhu Heping] standing outside the door.
0:49:39|0:49:48|[Li Yangduo] pulled hard against [Zhu Heping], finally unzipping the jacket. Instinctively, she reached out to take the jacket he was about to remove, and pointed to his neck, indicating for him to take off the scarf.
0:49:48|0:49:54|[Zhuheping] tidied up his clothes and walked towards his daughter.
0:50:6|0:50:12|[Zhu Li] quickly fled the room with a tablet in her arms, while [Li Yangduo] had a big smile on her face.
0:50:14|0:50:20|[Zhu Heping] got up and pointed towards the kitchen, then walked out of the room with his head down, leaving only [Li Yangduo] behind.
0:50:20|0:50:29|Standing still in place, [Zhu Heping] walks into the kitchen.
0:51:7|0:51:17|You were chattering away, completely unaware that [Old Li] had already reached the doorway of the room.
0:52:27|0:52:33|[Zhu Heping] holds [Old Li]'s hand with a very sincere attitude,
0:53:0|0:53:7|He was at a loss for words on how to refute at that moment.
0:56:20|0:56:33|Old Li was furious and stood up abruptly, pointing at Li Yangduo. Zhu Heping quickly handed the ladle to Old Li.
0:56:33|0:56:51|[Old Li] vigorously shook the frying spoon, and the already damaged frying spoon broke with a sound. [Li Yangduo] stood with hands on hips, glaring straight at [Old Li] in anger.
0:56:52|0:56:56|[Zhu Heping] placed both hands on [Old Li]'s shoulders, constantly comforting him.
0:56:57|0:57:13|[Old Li] glanced back at [Zhu Heping], then turned his gaze to [Li Yangduo], walked out angrily, causing the two inside the house to tremble involuntarily before coming back to their senses.
0:57:13|0:57:18|Both of them turned sideways and looked at each other, creating a somewhat awkward atmosphere.
0:57:32|0:57:40|[Zhu Li] hesitated for a moment on how to speak, then slowly reached out to hold the hands of [Zhu Heping] and [Li Yangduo].
0:58:14|0:58:27|[Zhu Li] stopped her steps back to the room, turned around and linked arms with [Zhu Heping], walking towards the door. In the blink of an eye, they were already outside the door.
0:59:40|0:59:54|The camera cuts back to the door, where [Li Yangduo] stands leaning against the door frame with a vacant look in her eyes. The lively laughter of her daughter and Sun Wukong outside fails to pique her interest. Sun Wukong's sudden appearance has left her deeply shaken.
0:59:57|1:0:4|She suddenly chuckled involuntarily, tears uncontrollably streaming down her face. She hurriedly covered her face with a scarf as the music started playing.
1:0:4|1:0:12|As the sky darkens, [Li Yangduo] sits with his legs crossed on the sofa, one hand supporting his chin, the other hand playing with a cellphone.
1:0:52|1:1:19|In the bedroom, [Zhu Li] was holding a tablet and video chatting with her girlfriend. Suddenly, she started dry heaving, hastily took off her earphones to find a trash can. Her girlfriend on the other end of the video was getting anxious, calling [Zhu Li]'s name repeatedly. After dry heaving for a while, [Zhu Li] finally started to feel better. She covered her mouth and ran back to the bedroom, picked up her phone from the bed, didn't have time to talk to her girlfriend, and returned to the side of the trash can.
1:1:19|1:1:26|Continuously swiping on the phone, her gaze never leaving the screen. Another bout of violent retching, she simply
1:1:26|1:1:32|Sitting on the floor, [Li Yangduo] opened Pete's chat page.
1:1:34|1:1:42|Two voice messages were sent out but received no response. She then opened her contacts and found Pete's phone number, pressing the dial button without hesitation.
1:1:45|1:1:51|In the kitchen, [Old Li] is currently flipping a wok.
1:5:17|1:5:34|[Xiao Tian] Boss and Goddess's rap battle comes to an end, and another beautiful woman passes by the convenience store. [Xiao Tian] jumps off the car, and the woman looks back at [Xiao Tian] with a gaze of blame and anger.
1:5:48|1:5:53|The beauty raised her hand forward, [Xiao Tian] was scared and kept retreating.
1:6:5|1:6:19|In the fifth act of the film, night falls along with darkness, the sky completely darkened. The quiet alley is devoid of pedestrians, a stark contrast to the bustling noon.
1:6:20|1:6:27|A delivery van slowly drives into the alley and stops behind the convenience store. [Old Li] gets off the van.
1:6:27|1:6:36|He wrapped himself in a scarf, limped into the convenience store, and then reached out to tap on the car window.
1:6:36|1:6:44|There was no response in the car. The reunion of the family's lights illuminated the New Year's Eve alley, and the lonely [Old Li] also felt a surge at this moment.
1:6:44|1:6:50|Deeply missing his family, [Old Li] slowly stepped into the car with heavy footsteps.
1:6:50|1:6:56|[Xiao Tian] the boss is wearing headphones watching a female anchor sing, the background noise is particularly loud at this moment.
1:6:56|1:7:3|Master Li passed by Xiao Tian and quietly sat curled up in the corner of the van. The work in the kitchen was almost finished.
1:7:3|1:7:18|The ingredients, stir-fried at high temperature, exhibit an enticing color. [Old Li] skillfully plates them, then opens the lid of the pot filled with sour cabbage. The thick soup keeps boiling, and the hot steam fills the entire room like a fragrance.
1:9:46|1:9:54|The delivery man in the corner heard the conversation between the two and stood up stiffly, while Xiao Tian dashed towards the TV like lightning.
1:10:11|1:10:34|In the blink of an eye, [Xiao Tian] had already reached the van with the TV in his arms. The weight of the old TV made it difficult for [Xiao Tian], and after several attempts, he couldn't get the TV into the car. The delivery driver drove closer in the van, stopped in front of the van, and stared at [Xiao Tian] without offering to help. Instead, he slapped him hard, causing [Xiao Tian] to put the TV on the ground.
1:10:34|1:10:43|The delivery man opened the car door, took out a new LCD TV and put it into Xiao Tian's arms, then pointed to the direction of the door to indicate him to move it in.
1:10:43|1:10:50|The delivery man bent down and lifted the old TV set from the ground, struggling to squeeze it into the delivery van.
1:11:2|1:11:14|[Old Li] in festive cotton clothes welcomed everyone to sit at the dining table. The person next to him patted [Zhu Li], and [Old Li] gestured for [Zhu Li] to take off her earphones.
1:11:55|1:12:2|[Xiao Tian] was getting a little impatient with the questions.
1:12:33|1:12:40|[Li Yangduo] snatched the tablet from [Zhu Li]'s hands, as [Old Li] raised his glass to speak, [Zhu Li] suddenly got up and rushed to the restroom, holding her mouth.
1:12:49|1:12:59|After settling Zhu Li, Peter returned to the dining table. Li Yangduo and Old Li stood still in place after listening.
1:13:7|1:13:20|Pete's expression was full of helplessness, with [Old Li] and [Li Yangduo] looking bewildered, staring intently at [Zhu Li] walking out of the restroom, locking her in with sharp eyes.
1:13:47|1:13:54|Xiao Tian didn't stand on ceremony either, picking up the chopsticks and stuffing food into his mouth. Old Li raised his glass and drank it all in one gulp, then slammed the glass heavily on the table.
1:14:9|1:14:17|Li Yangduo's gaze has been fixed on Zhu Li, and at this moment, Li Yangduo can't hold back anymore.
1:14:48|1:14:54|[Zhu Li] dropped her chopsticks and stood up.
1:15:10|1:15:19|[Li Yangduo] listened with wide eyes. Old Li was seen bowing his head and drinking.
1:15:19|1:15:28|One drink after another, without saying a word. The air seemed to freeze, everyone was silent, and [Xiao Tian] also stopped using his chopsticks.
1:15:28|1:15:36|Staring at [Zhu Li] in surprise, [Zhu Li] flicked off the food in her hand and paused before continuing.
1:17:6|1:17:29|Two loud slaps landed on Zhu Li's face, scaring Pete next to her to step back repeatedly. Zhu Li smiled indifferently, even as her passport was torn to pieces. Li Yangduo covered her face and wept.
1:17:29|1:17:37|The body suddenly lost strength, and for a moment, it was a bit unstable. [Xiao Tian] held the bowl and chopsticks, looking at [Zhu Li] in confusion.
1:17:38|1:17:40|He casually reached out to pick up the dish after listening.
1:17:40|1:17:48|[Li Yangduo]'s emotions became more and more unstable, staggering as she walked towards the bedroom. [Old Li] furrowed his brow, silently refilling his glass with alcohol.
1:18:18|1:18:26|The two's emotions gradually calmed down, while [Old Li] continued to drink sullenly with his head tilted back.
1:18:38|1:18:44|Caressing Zhu Li's face, then gently wiping away Zhu Li's tears with his hand, his eyes filled with affection.
1:18:44|1:18:51|Suddenly, Zhu Li's strong sense of nausea interrupted the two of them, and Pete quickly followed Zhu Li into the bathroom.
1:19:13|1:19:20|The empty room fell into a silent darkness, with no more lively atmosphere or noise.
1:19:21|1:19:28|The sumptuous reunion dinner was spread out on the table, engulfed by darkness. [Old Li] lit a candle.
1:19:28|1:19:36|The dim candlelight reflected on his face, looking somewhat lonely. He dragged his heavy footsteps.
1:19:36|1:19:45|Approaching the dining table slowly from the corner of the room, [Old Li] casually picks up a plate. With the help of dim light, every move of his is captured.
1:19:45|1:19:51|Everyone was so careful. Before long, the plates were filled with all kinds of dishes.
1:19:51|1:19:57|At the same time, the deliveryman [Old Li] limped his way to [Old Li]'s house.
1:19:57|1:20:4|[Li Yangduo] relies on crying on the sofa, completely indifferent to the sudden darkness. [Old Li] holds a plate in one hand,
1:20:4|1:20:29|With a candle in one hand, [Xiao Tian] arrived outside the memorial hall of his late partner. He and [Old Li] were using a flashlight to carefully inspect the electrical circuit malfunction at [Old Li]'s home. [Old Li] leaned against the table, staring blankly at the memorial tablet for a moment before continuing to speak.
1:21:35|1:21:43|[Old Li] adjusted his glasses and picked up the glass of wine in front of him.
1:21:46|1:21:55|At this moment, he was feeling heavy-hearted, wanting only to chat with his deceased old partner. As the wine in the cup was spilled on the ground,
1:21:55|1:22:2|[Old Li] fell into silence again. After composing himself, [Old Li] returned to the dining table.
1:22:2|1:22:7|Suddenly, the bright lights illuminated the small room again.
1:22:9|1:22:17|[Old Li] finished repairing the electrical circuit and returned to the van. [Old Li] stared at the dining table in confusion.
1:22:18|1:22:25|As if completely forgetting that he had cooked the meal on the table himself, as if nothing had happened just now. He scanned the room,
1:22:28|1:22:33|Scratching his head, he tried hard to remember that the Chinese New Year had passed.
1:22:34|1:22:42|His hand fumbled in the clothes, then took out several red envelopes from the pocket.
1:22:54|1:23:2|In the bedroom, [Li Yangduo] listens to [Old Li] muttering to himself.
1:23:2|1:23:11|Thinking of his daughter who had already returned from studying abroad and was pregnant and had to drop out of school, his emotions collapsed again. [Old Li] held up the phone that wasn't connected.
1:23:13|1:23:16|Glued to his ear, seeing no response, he brought the phone back in front of his eyes and stared at the screen.
1:24:9|1:24:17|After speaking, he slumped back in the chair, letting out a heavy sigh.
1:24:18|1:24:31|Looking at the table full of dishes, he stood up again with the red envelopes in his hand and started distributing them one by one on the table.
1:24:41|1:24:50|Old Li, who finished these tasks, is ready to go out.
1:24:50|1:25:6|The room was empty, with only the food on the stove steaming. Soon, [Old Li] arrived at the door. He put on his coat, wore his hat, and as he stepped over the threshold, he accidentally tripped and almost fell.
1:25:10|1:25:17|On New Year's Eve, the alley was deserted, and no one knew where [Old Li] could go after leaving home.
1:25:17|1:25:25|[Xiao Tian] watched the live broadcast in the van. Despite wearing thick clothes, the late-night cold still made him tighten his scarf.
1:25:26|1:25:32|[Old Li] still lay in the corner, staring blankly at the ceiling, lost in his thoughts.
1:25:34|1:25:40|[Old Li] passed by a restaurant where a group of people sat around a table, enjoying their meal and drinks with laughter and joy.
1:25:40|1:25:46|[Old Li] cast a hurried glance and continued walking forward.
1:26:27|1:26:37|The sanitation worker greeted [Old Li] warmly. In the bedroom of [Li Yangduo]'s home, she was still immersed in the pain she had just experienced.
1:26:37|1:26:43|Her eyes were red and swollen from crying. It had been a long time since she had taken care of [Old Li], and she couldn't help but feel a little worried.
1:26:43|1:26:48|She stopped crying, composed herself, and prepared to see what [Old Li] was up to.
1:26:48|1:27:0|At this moment, [Old Li] has been away from home for a long time. [Li Yangduo] is getting anxious, not seeing [Old Li] anywhere inside or outside. She realizes something is wrong, so she quickens her pace, calling out as she runs.
1:27:0|1:27:16|Pete heard the shout and quickly came out to look for [Old Li], while [Zhu Li] was also a bit flustered.
1:28:1|1:28:11|All of a sudden, everyone rushed out, calling urgently for [Old Li].
1:28:11|1:28:25|No one has ever seen [Old Li], making it difficult to find a missing elderly person in this large county town. [Xiao Tian] and [Li Yangduo] also joined the search team, with [Li Yangduo] quickly starting the van and [Xiao Tian] gesturing for them to get in quickly.
1:28:25|1:28:36|Everyone mobilized their relatives and friends to search together.
1:29:1|1:29:8|[Xiao Tian] shouted loudly out of the car window.
1:29:8|1:29:17|[Zhu Li] also posted a missing person notice on Weibo.
1:29:43|1:29:50|The missing person notice sank like a stone in the sea, as everyone was immersed in their own joy, welcoming the arrival of the new year together.
1:29:52|1:29:56|Outside, it started snowing heavily at some point, but [Old Li] still had no news at all.
1:31:12|1:31:21|With the help of [Zhu Li], the missing person notice started to be widely shared on Weibo, and eye-catching notices were played on every TV in the neighborhood.
1:31:22|1:31:31|At this moment, this elderly man with dementia from the northeast who went missing on New Year's Eve has touched the hearts of hundreds of millions of people across the country, for every Chinese person,
1:31:31|1:31:39|New Year's Eve is a day of family reunion, and at this moment, the united Chinese people's strength is like a tightly twisted rope.
1:31:39|1:31:48|Although they didn't know [Old Li], they contributed their meager efforts to this unfamiliar old man through the forwarded Weibo posts.
1:31:48|1:31:54|[Zhu Li] was already in tears as she looked at her phone. At the same time, Yao Chen was also talking to her mother on the phone.
1:32:23|1:32:37|Just now, the sanitation worker stood in the snow with a child, eating. She held a steaming lunchbox in her arms, looking heart-wrenching, but because of the company of family.
1:32:39|1:32:44|The meal seemed to become more enjoyable. The snow was falling heavier.
1:32:44|1:32:47|The mother and son are sending voice messages to their family next to the sanitation truck.
1:32:48|1:33:10|It may have been arranged by fate. Inadvertently, she also saw the missing person notice that was being wildly forwarded. She tried hard to recall the person she had just met. It turned out that when [Old Li] passed by her, she even greeted [Old Li]. She immediately spread the message.
1:33:10|1:33:39|Soon, Zhu Li received messages from netizens on her phone. Old Li nodded repeatedly upon hearing the news, gesturing to Li Yangduo, and immediately accelerated towards the direction of the train station with everyone.
1:34:2|1:34:10|Just as everyone was overjoyed to find [Old Li], [Master Li] knelt on the ground with tears in his eyes.
1:34:13|1:34:20|[Old Li] took off his mask, unable to hide the excitement in his heart.
1:34:21|1:34:28|Hearing this name [Old Li] also felt a bit dazed, staring with wide eyes at [Li Ermao] kneeling on the ground.
1:34:28|1:34:36|Li Ermao took off his hat and looked up at Old Li, then quickly lowered his head, too afraid to look again. After all these years,
1:34:36|1:34:44|He has been blaming himself for stealing money from [Old Li] back then, preferring to hide in the van outside the door and work as a delivery man.
1:34:44|1:34:52|Every day, [Li Ermao] could only watch [Old Li] from afar. Today, he could no longer contain the guilt in his heart.
1:34:52|1:34:58|He shouted out "Dad" with all his heart and soul, a word that had been on his lips day and night.
1:34:58|1:35:5|[Old Li] was already in tears. Yes, how could there be lasting grudges between loved ones?
1:35:5|1:35:13|The mistake made by [Li Ermao] in the past had long been washed away by time, turning into a deep longing from [Old Li] for his son.
1:35:13|1:35:21|[Li Yangduo] watched as tears streamed down the face of [Old Li], unable to control her own tears anymore.
1:35:21|1:35:30|Now the family is reunited, the three of them embrace tightly, and time seems to have turned into eternity at this moment.
1:35:30|1:35:37|[Old Li] gently tapped on [Li Ermao]'s back, as if blaming him for his stubbornness over the years.
1:35:37|1:35:42|This moment has been long awaited. On this New Year's Eve,
1:35:42|1:35:47|The family is truly reunited. Out of the blue, [Xiao Tian] suddenly starts singing.
1:35:56|1:36:3|[Xiao Tian]'s sudden singing broke the somber mood, and everyone walked hand in hand towards the direction of home.
