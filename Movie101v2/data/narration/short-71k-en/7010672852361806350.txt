0:2:10|0:2:23|[Ye Xun] impatiently hung up the phone in her hand. She was tall and slender, dressed in an evening gown with delicate makeup. Not far away, the male lead [Huang Da] also hung up the phone, and with a glance, he saw [Ye Xun].
0:2:23|0:2:38|Compared to [Ye Xun], he is wearing an unironed suit with a dark floral short-sleeved shirt underneath. He looks up and down at [Ye Xun], who feels his gaze and turns to stare at him blankly.
0:3:7|0:3:10|Huang Da and Ye Xun each turned around and left after finishing their conversation.
0:3:10|0:3:14|[Huang Da] and his blind date sat face to face at the dining table.
0:3:28|0:3:40|[Ye Xun] also met her blind date Zhao Yongge at this moment. The waiter poured a glass of wine for each of them. Zhao Yongge propped his head with one hand, pointed at the wine glass with the other hand, and said in English: Miss Ye, please enjoy. Let's see if you like it.
0:5:20|0:5:27|He suddenly heard his phone ringing, Zhao Yongge finished speaking to [Ye Xun], then turned and left the table.
0:5:27|0:5:35|[Ye Xun] smiled at him and picked up her phone.
0:6:32|0:6:40|[Huang Da] sat back at the dining table, and a phone rang in the private room where [Ye Xun] was.
0:7:2|0:7:8|Just as he finished speaking, a woman passed by [Huang Da], looking around, searching for something.
0:7:18|0:7:26|As soon as Zhao Yongge finished speaking, he immediately used the magazine on the table to cover his face. The woman who had been looking around just now crossed her hands in front of her chest and walked towards him.
0:7:26|0:7:32|The newcomer turns out to be Huang Da's wife, who sits next to Huang Da and he puts down the magazine in front of him.
0:9:42|0:9:51|Mrs. Zhao grabbed a snack and hit [Huang Da], who tasted it and stood on the snack with his hair.
0:9:56|0:10:3|[Huang Da] took [Ye Xun] by the hand and left the scene. They walked through the restaurant lobby to the elevator, where [Huang Da] finally let go of [Ye Xun]'s hand.
0:10:3|0:10:8|[Ye Xun] smiled and took out a tissue to help him wipe away the crumbs on his face.
0:11:30|0:11:37|[Huang Da] took out a notebook from his jacket pocket and flipped through the pages, reading the words written on them.
0:12:23|0:12:37|[Ye Xun] held the steering wheel and excitedly talked while looking at the road ahead, while [Huang Da] sat silently in the passenger seat watching her. Seeing that [Huang Da] did not respond to her, [Ye Xun] awkwardly withdrew her smile, then pressed the button in the car to play music.
0:12:43|0:12:51|Upon hearing Huang Da's words, Ye Xun once again put away her smile, focusing on the road ahead. For the rest of the journey, the two of them did not speak again.
0:12:51|0:12:58|[Ye Xun] drove into an old residential area. After the car stopped, [Huang Da] got out, and [Ye Xun] rolled down the car window.
0:12:58|0:13:9|Called out to [Huang Da] who was about to leave. After a brief greeting, [Ye Xun] drove out of the neighborhood.
0:13:9|0:13:17|[Huang Da] stood in place watching her leave, when three people suddenly rushed out from behind him, following his gaze.
0:13:57|0:14:8|After finishing their conversation, the four of them walked towards the apartment building, laughing. Before they could enter, the sound of a car came from behind. [Huang Da] walked towards the car in a daze.
0:14:36|0:14:52|Early the next morning, [Ye Xun] arrived at the Shanghai Art Center. She was wearing a dark long dress, sitting in the empty venue with her cello placed between her legs. Her left hand pressed on the strings, while her right hand pulled the bow.
0:14:55|0:15:7|In front of them, several people were listening carefully to the music played by [Ye Xun]. The music sounded somewhat melancholic, and [Ye Xun]'s thoughts drifted back to three years ago, back to the day of her own wedding.
0:15:7|0:15:13|She is wearing a clean as snow wedding dress, waiting silently for a man on the hotel balcony.
0:15:13|0:15:20|In Ye Xun's memory, a man is sitting on a bus, but the bus overturns, causing an accident.
0:15:20|0:15:25|At the wedding scene, [Ye Xun] waited silently but the man did not show up.
0:15:25|0:15:43|That day, the guests were in high spirits, the wedding scene was elegantly decorated, with tables filled with red wine and roses. [Ye Xun] ran outside with her long wedding dress, wiping away tears as they fell uncontrollably. She ran away in the gaze of relatives and friends.
0:15:43|0:15:50|As the last note of the music fell, [Ye Xun]'s thoughts were also brought back to reality, and a luxury car pulled up at the entrance of the Shanghai Art Center.
0:15:54|0:16:0|The car almost hit the pedestrians walking at the entrance, and after the car stopped, a man walked out from inside.
0:16:0|0:16:6|The man in a suit and leather shoes, only recognized after getting off the car that the person who came was [Zhao Yongge], who went on a blind date with [Ye Xun] last night.
0:16:6|0:16:12|At this moment, a luxurious car stopped next to an old low-end car, and [Huang Da] stepped out wearing a checkered shirt.
0:16:36|0:16:44|After Huang Da finished speaking, he walked into the art center. Ye Xun carried her cello into the hall and ran into her best friend Taozi.
0:19:35|0:19:42|After speaking, [Huang Da] turned and walked towards the nearby ATM. He put the money in his bag and found his colleagues who had come with him.
0:19:43|0:19:52|Three coworkers gathered around him, then opened the bag and took out money to share with the three coworkers.
0:21:18|0:21:24|[Ye Xun] took out her phone and pressed the play button towards Zhao Yongge.
0:21:53|0:21:57|[Huang Da], [Taozi] and others arrived at the night market, where [Taozi] pulled [Ye Xun] aside.
0:24:18|0:24:24|[Ye Xun] blurted out everything she wanted to say, only to suddenly realize that her words were a bit untimely.
0:24:24|0:24:32|Huang Da immediately stopped, got up from the table, and drove away with tears in her eyes, her thoughts returning to the past.
0:24:32|0:24:39|In her memory, she looked at the man in front of her with a happy face, while on the other side, the dinner with Huang Da and others at the night market had also ended.
0:24:39|0:24:46|[Taozi] walked out of the bumpy alley in the night market wearing high heels, with [Huang Da] following closely behind her.
0:24:54|0:25:1|Suddenly, a taxi arrived behind them, but a man quickly got in before [Taozi], leaving a hint of anger in her eyes.
0:25:1|0:25:5|Staring fiercely at the taxi as it drives away.
0:25:18|0:25:24|[Taozi] finished speaking with the anger from before, suddenly realizing that her words were inappropriate, she stopped in her tracks.
0:26:2|0:26:8|Another taxi drove away, [Taozi] looked at the car leaving again, turned around and said to [Huang Da]:
0:26:24|0:26:42|One day, [Xu Zhuo] brought [Ye Xun] to the seaside. He slowly removed the cloth in front of [Ye Xun's] eyes, then took out a gift box from his pocket. He knelt down on the beach, opened the gift box, and held it in front of [Ye Xun] with both hands, looking at her affectionately.
0:26:55|0:27:1|After speaking, he took out something from the gift box and placed it in [Ye Xun]'s hand.
0:27:6|0:27:15|[Ye Xun] lowered her head shyly and smiled, then leaned into [Xu Zhuo]'s arms. After [Xu Zhuo] passed away, [Ye Xun] would always reminisce about him, silently shedding tears alone.
0:28:30|0:28:35|[Taozi] stopped a taxi while talking, then quickly got in and left.
0:28:35|0:28:41|[Huang Da] stood still in place.
0:28:48|0:29:4|After returning home, [Huang Da] sat on the bed looking out the window, recalling the words [Ye Xun] said at the dinner table. He then went to the Shanghai Art Center, where he found [Ye Xun] squatting on the ground, packing the cello into a case. [Huang Da] approached her, carrying a bag in each hand.
0:29:25|0:29:33|[Huang Da] opened the bag in his hand, [Ye Xun] placed the ice cream handed to her by [Huang Da] on the piano, and then looked into the bag.
0:29:35|0:29:43|[Ye Xun] grabbed a lottery ticket and froze, while [Huang Da] grinned foolishly at her.
0:31:46|0:31:55|[Ye Xun] heard what he said, slowly raised her head to look at him, [Huang Da] also looked at [Ye Xun], his eyes reluctant to leave.
0:31:55|0:32:2|The two of them looked at each other like this, and [Ye Xun]'s sudden question left [Huang Da] stunned.
0:32:4|0:32:22|Huang Da, who had regained his composure, thought for a moment and said, Ye Xun picked up the lottery ticket in her hand. Huang Da took the ticket from her hand with one hand, and with the other hand, he compared the numbers on the ticket with those in the prize-winning newspaper. After confirming the numbers, he first opened his mouth in surprise, then turned to look at Ye Xun, who was smiling at him beside him. When he got home, ...
0:32:22|0:32:32|[Huang Da] squats on the ground, takes out a book from under the chair and throws it aside, then steadies the chair and puts on a pair of chunky dark high heels, with one foot on the stool.
0:32:32|0:32:51|Then he took out a tape measure and carefully measured the height of the high heels. His coworkers hid outside the door watching him inside. After measuring the length of the high heels, [Huang Da] sat on a chair and fiddled with them. The next day, [Taozi] went to find [Ye Xun].
0:32:55|0:33:3|[Ye Xun] is fiddling with her cello. [Taozi] glanced at the phone that rang again.
0:33:15|0:33:19|[Taozi] puts down what she's holding and rushes towards the phone not far away.
0:34:56|0:35:3|After saying that, he walked out of the house under renovation. The next night, he showed up at the party as [Ye Xun] had mentioned, wearing a simple shirt.
0:35:51|0:35:58|The foreigner asked [Ye Xun] if he is also a musician. [Ye Xun] replied that [Huang Da] is an architect and denied that [Huang Da] is her boyfriend.
0:36:21|0:36:26|Shortly after, the group raised their glasses of red wine together, toasted each other, and took a few sips.
0:36:28|0:36:34|[Huang Da], with his bag in his arms, awkwardly holds up his glass. After putting down the glass, [Ye Xun] asks the foreigner, "When are you going on your honeymoon?"
0:36:38|0:36:41|The foreigners expressed their intention to get married first and then go on a honeymoon in Europe, continuing to communicate with each other.
0:36:41|0:36:50|[Huang Da] suddenly stood up, slinging the bag over his shoulder. [Ye Xun] nodded in agreement to his request, then started chatting with friends across the table.
0:36:50|0:36:57|[Huang Da] walked around the table towards the other side, [Ye Xun] saw him walking further and further away, looking at the direction he was leaving in confusion.
0:36:57|0:37:8|[Huang Da] walked to a distant open compartment, where there was a small swimming pool with people in swimsuits. He stood among them, and a woman beside him recognized an acquaintance.
0:37:10|0:37:22|[Huang Da] quietly walked to the side of the door after seeing it, leaning against the door and watching the people around him with pursed lips. [Ye Xun] walked to his side, hesitated for a moment, and then said to him:
0:37:31|0:37:44|[Ye Xun] finished speaking and then turned around to leave. [Huang Da] awkwardly smiled, his face darkening as he watched [Ye Xun] walk away. He then left the bar scene. [Ye Xun] returned to the table and continued listening to the foreigner telling his story.
0:37:44|0:37:55|[Ye Xun] happily listened to the foreigner speaking with one hand supporting her head. She slowly thought of [Huang Da], and her smiling face gradually returned to calm. Then she stood up and left, walking towards the tavern outside.
0:38:5|0:38:11|[Ye Xun] smiled at him, and then the two of them walked outside together.
0:38:11|0:38:27|After getting on the elevator, the two of them didn't speak, each looking at a corner of the elevator in silence for a long time. Breaking the silence, [Ye Xun] asked [Huang Da]. [Huang Da] grabbed his left wrist with his right hand, glanced at [Ye Xun], and then said:
0:38:33|0:38:47|He nervously licked his lower lip, his hand gripping his wrist tightened involuntarily, he swallowed saliva again, Ye Xun couldn't help but laugh, and Huang Da laughed along.
0:38:51|0:38:57|[Ye Xun] brought [Huang Da] to her home. She walked into the kitchen, boiled water, and put a packet of instant noodles into the pot.
0:38:57|0:39:6|[Huang Da] sat on the sofa in the living room, looking around [Ye Xun]'s house. After [Ye Xun] finished cooking noodles, she carried a bowl out of the kitchen.
0:39:6|0:39:11|Then pass the bowl to [Huang Da].
0:39:33|0:39:39|[Ye Xun] chuckled and did not give him a direct answer.
0:39:48|0:39:55|[Ye Xun] got up from the sofa and walked towards the second floor. After a while, he came downstairs and handed something to [Huang Da].
0:40:45|0:41:7|After that day, the distance between [Huang Da] and [Ye Xun] got closer. When Huang Da is free, he would accompany Ye Xun to the Shanghai Art Center to practice the piano. While Ye Xun played the violin, he would sometimes write or draw on the side, sometimes squatting next to Ye Xun, measuring her height. After many days of contact, the distance between the two of them grew closer.
0:41:7|0:41:26|[Ye Xun] will drink and chat with [Huang Da] at the night market, and [Huang Da] will also accompany [Ye Xun] to do yoga on the grass in the early morning. When they return home at night, he will sit on a chair wearing high heels, using a painting easel as a cello, playing with it, and drawing various chairs with different shapes on the blackboard, repeatedly modifying them on the drawing paper.
0:41:26|0:41:33|The three roommates were puzzled by his strange behavior and often peeked at him from outside the door.
0:41:33|0:41:42|One night, Huang Da, wearing high heels as usual, sat on a chair playing with something in his hand. Suddenly, a loud noise interrupted him, and he looked towards the door.
0:42:27|0:42:36|Two workers carrying renovation materials walk downstairs, while [Ye Xun] walks upstairs holding her skirt, lightly touching the wall with one hand, listening carefully to [Huang Da]'s voice, with a smile on her face.
0:42:45|0:42:56|Following the singing of [Huang Da], [Ye Xun] found him. [Huang Da] was tinkering with the drain in the bathroom. [Ye Xun] listened outside the door for a while, then walked into the bathroom and knocked on the door of the shower room.
0:43:15|0:43:24|[Huang Da] took off his construction gloves and led [Ye Xun] to the corridor outside the bathroom.
0:44:35|0:44:52|[Huang Da] was speaking joyfully, but [Ye Xun]'s face gradually darkened. Scenes of [Xu Zhuo] proposing to her at the seaside kept flashing in her mind. She closed her eyes, then opened them and walked downstairs without looking back. After a moment of daze, [Huang Da] followed [Ye Xun] downstairs.
0:44:52|0:44:58|The night has fallen, and the two of them are walking on the sidewalk. [Huang Da] hesitated but eventually spoke up.
0:45:12|0:45:18|[Ye Xun] coldly rejected him and walked ahead on her own. Unwillingly, [Huang Da] asked again:
0:45:30|0:45:41|After speaking, [Ye Xun] turned and walked forward, while [Huang Da] stood still for a moment, then hurried to catch up.
0:46:28|0:46:34|[Ye Xun] finished speaking, [Huang Da] pursed his lips, swallowed, then turned and ran towards the middle of the road.
0:46:48|0:47:1|[Ye Xun] shed tears as she listened to his words, and a truck coming towards them almost hit [Huang Da]. The truck driver managed to brake in time, leaving only a fist's distance between the truck and [Huang Da].
0:47:1|0:47:12|[Ye Xun] was so scared by the distance between them that she didn't move at all. The truck took a detour and left, while [Huang Da] pointed at the departing truck.
0:47:14|0:47:29|[Ye Xun] lowered her eyes to calm down from the previous emotions, she raised her red eyes and looked at [Huang Da], slowly saying: [Huang Da] stood still and looked at her, [Ye Xun] ignored him and walked forward with her head down.
0:47:29|0:47:35|[Huang Da] didn't chase after her anymore. He stood still and watched [Ye Xun] leave, then squatted down by the side of the road.
0:47:35|0:47:44|[Ye Xun] had not taken a few steps before tears welled up in her eyes again, and drop by drop, tears slid down her cheeks, her emotions gradually collapsing.
0:47:44|0:47:56|From silent crying at the beginning to later sobbing, [Huang Da] squatted on the side of the road and started to weep. He just watched [Ye Xun] walk away little by little. He stayed by the roadside for a long time and didn't return to his place until midnight.
0:47:56|0:48:11|Early the next morning, [Taozi] arrived at [Ye Xun]'s house. She casually browsed through the books on the shelf while [Ye Xun] was downstairs holding a potted plant. After setting down the book on the second floor, [Taozi] spoke to her.
0:49:23|0:49:40|[Ye Xun] cleaned up and then went to the Shanghai Art Center. She sat in a chair absentmindedly drawing musical notes, pondering [Taozi]'s words repeatedly. After finishing eating, she quietly went to [Taozi]'s bridal shop.
0:49:40|0:49:46|The shop assistant is taking inventory of wedding dresses, while [Ye Xun] looks around at the customers in the shop. The assistant notices her.
0:50:45|0:50:58|[Huang Da]'s friend walked out of the fitting room after trying on a wedding dress. She almost stumbled in her high heels, but [Huang Da] quickly caught her. [Ye Xun] stood not far away, hands on hips, angrily watching the two of them.
0:51:55|0:52:0|[Taozi] hurriedly pulled [Ye Xun] away.
0:52:58|0:53:4|The script is written in Chinese characters that sound like Japanese, and after a while, a man in a suit walked in.
0:53:34|0:53:42|The camera automatically starts playing a clip secretly filmed by [Huang Da] of [Ye Xun], which surprises the Japanese man.
0:54:4|0:54:25|The Japanese man took out a wallet from his shirt pocket, opened it, and showed [Huang Da] a photo of him and his beautiful wife inside. He pointed to himself and then to the wife in the photo, indicating the age difference between them. He encouraged [Huang Da] to work hard and gave him a thumbs up. Later that night, after [Ye Xun] finished her performance, she carried her cello and ran towards the location where the Japanese man was.
0:54:40|0:54:47|[Huang Da] quickly got up and took the cello off her, [Ye Xun] took off her bag and sat on the chair, while [Huang Da] sat on the chair behind [Ye Xun].
0:56:12|0:56:18|But over 20 years have passed, and my wife has still aged just like me.
0:56:28|0:56:47|[Ye Xun] handed one end of the scarf to [Huang Da], and the two of them each pulled a corner. The Japanese man said that if the scarf was opened up to look at, the two of you would have to separate further. Then he asked [Ye Xun] to fold the scarf, and said that in order to fold it nicely, the two of you must hold hands. Looking at their hands holding each other, [Ye Xun] and [Huang Da] were lost in thought. The Japanese man said sincerely:
0:57:20|0:57:32|The next day, the Japanese left China. [Ye Xun] received a call from him in the car, asking him to take care of himself and bid farewell to him. After hanging up the phone, she looked at the notebook of [Huang Da] from last night.
0:57:43|0:57:52|The two drove to the nearby beach.
0:57:54|0:58:10|After getting off the car, [Ye Xun] ran towards the seaside, with [Huang Da] following closely behind. The sea breeze blew [Ye Xun]'s long hair as they walked shoulder to shoulder to the coast. Once they stopped, [Ye Xun] gazed at the distant sea.
0:58:10|0:58:25|Facing the sudden question from [Ye Xun], [Huang Da] fell into contemplation. [Ye Xun] looked up at the sky, while [Huang Da] exhaled a breath from his chest and then took out a box from his jacket pocket.
0:58:25|0:58:30|[Ye Xun] glanced over, [Huang Da] opened the box and took out a ring from inside.
0:58:44|0:58:50|[Huang Da] stood up and looked at the ring in his hand, then started to fiddle with it. [Ye Xun] turned around with her back facing him.
0:58:50|0:58:58|[Huang Da] throws the ring in his hand into the sea, and [Ye Xun] turns to look at him upon hearing the sound.
0:58:59|0:59:8|She looked down at [Huang Da]'s hand holding the ring, walked over and grabbed his hand, then grabbed the other hand.
0:59:17|0:59:31|Upon hearing the amount of 20,000, [Ye Xun] stood still in place, then ran towards the beach where [Huang Da] had just lost the ring, carefully searching for it with her head down. Her high heels were stuck in the muddy sand, but she didn't care to put them back on before running off to another place.
0:59:40|0:59:47|[Huang Da] smiled without saying a word, [Ye Xun] helplessly lowered her head and continued searching, unable to resist continuing to complain:
0:59:56|1:0:14|[Huang Da] hesitated for a moment, then pursed his lips and said to her, "Ye Xun, that..." Ye Xun paused in her search for the ring, slowly stood up straight, avoiding [Huang Da]'s gaze, and looked towards the other side.
1:0:14|1:0:20|Then she slowly turned her head and looked at [Huang Da], hesitated for a moment, and said to [Huang Da]:
1:0:24|1:0:33|After receiving affirmation from [Ye Xun] once again, [Huang Da] suddenly became energetic, turning around and carefully searching for the ring. Suddenly lifting his head, it seemed like he saw something?
1:0:36|1:0:53|[Huang Da] hurried over to pick up something from the beach, [Ye Xun] saw him holding the object motionless, and quickly ran to his side. She laughed when she saw the bolt that [Huang Da] picked up, took it from his hand, and smiled at him.
1:1:29|1:1:56|[Huang Da] watched as [Ye Xun]'s smile gradually faded. [Ye Xun] looked at him with a smile, the two of them gazing deeply at each other. [Huang Da]'s lips parted slightly, and [Ye Xun] couldn't help but take a small step forward. At that moment, her phone suddenly rang. She quickly opened her bag to find her phone, while [Huang Da] let out a deep sigh. [Ye Xun] took out her phone, glanced at the screen to see the caller ID, and then answered the call.
1:1:56|1:2:12|On the phone, after hearing what was said, [Ye Xun]'s face changed drastically. She stood frozen in place, not uttering a word. The phone slipped from her ear, and she turned to say:
1:2:28|1:2:45|[Huang Da] parked the car slowly by the side of the road, [Ye Xun] opened the door and got out from the passenger seat, then walked around to the driver's side. [Huang Da] got out from the driver's seat, but [Ye Xun] didn't even look at him, she just got in and left after closing the door.
1:2:45|1:2:53|[Huang Da] stood alone on the roadside, watching the car drive away. [Ye Xun] arrived at the airport, anxiously searching for something at the international flight exit.
1:3:0|1:3:5|At this moment, [Ye Xun]'s eyes were already red, filled with tears.
1:3:5|1:3:25|Just then, [Xu Zhuo] suddenly appeared in her sight, wearing a leather jacket and dragging a suitcase, standing not far away looking at [Ye Xun]. When [Ye Xun] saw [Xu Zhuo], tears flowed from her eyes. The two ran towards each other and embraced. [Ye Xun] cried in [Xu Zhuo]'s arms, while [Xu Zhuo] gently stroked her head.
1:3:25|1:3:29|The two of them then released the embrace, but still couldn't bear to separate, leaning their heads against each other and looking at each other.
1:4:24|1:4:36|[Huang Da] dropped the files, walked out of the room alone, and sat on the stairs outside. After [Taozi] walked out of the room and saw him, she leaned on the handrail of the stairs, thought for a moment, and then said to [Huang Da] sitting on the stairs.
1:4:53|1:5:20|[Huang Da] looked downstairs, then turned to look upstairs at [Taozi]. [Taozi] smiled at him and said, "After finishing speaking, her hand left the railing, turned back into the room. After a while, [Huang Da] returned to his room, leaning on the window to look at the scene outside, then turned to look at what he had made for [Ye Xun].
1:5:21|1:5:30|The next morning, [Ye Xun] and [Xu Zhuo] were running on the sidewalk in sportswear. After running for a while, they sat down on nearby chairs to rest.
1:5:31|1:5:37|[Ye Xun] smiled wearily, nodded slightly, and then looked at [Xu Zhuo].
1:5:40|1:5:44|[Ye Xun] put away her smile, she didn't say anything, just looked at [Xu Zhuo] in front of her.
1:5:44|1:5:51|After a while, she turned her head and stopped looking at [Xu Zhuo]. Her eyes stared blankly at the ground, and [Xu Zhuo] couldn't help but rub his hands together.
1:5:55|1:6:1|[Ye Xun] then looked up at him again, as [Xu Zhuo] began to recount the car accident he had three years ago.
1:6:1|1:6:20|After the bus he was riding in was hit, his head struck the seat in front of him. With the remaining consciousness, he trembled and staggered to his feet from the seat. His clothes were covered in blood as he grabbed onto the handrail of the bus and climbed out through the shattered window in front.
1:7:21|1:7:26|He was hoping for a response from [Ye Xun], but her eyes became evasive.
1:7:27|1:7:32|[Ye Xun] said this without looking into [Xu Zhuo]'s eyes. After a while, he raised his eyes and looked at [Xu Zhuo].
1:7:34|1:7:46|[Ye Xun] got up from the chair, [Xu Zhuo] sat in the distance watching [Ye Xun]'s back in contemplation, [Huang Da] carried a large box and rang the doorbell at [Ye Xun]'s house, then peered inside from a hole in the wall next to the house.
1:7:46|1:7:51|At this moment, [Ye Xun] and [Xu Zhuo] returned home and saw [Huang Da] standing at the door looking inside.
1:7:51|1:8:9|[Ye Xun] also leaned against the wall and looked inside the hole. Turning his head, he said, "[Xu Zhuo] walked to the door, took out the room card and swiped it on the door lock, then opened the door. After glancing at it, [Huang Da] said to [Ye Xun], "Xu Zhuo walked around to Ye Xun's side."
1:8:40|1:8:43|[Xu Zhuo] finished speaking and turned to walk into the room, [Huang Da] found it hard to refuse.
1:8:43|1:8:48|Three people arrived at a high-end restaurant together.
1:9:9|1:9:16|[Huang Da]'s words made [Ye Xun] laugh, and [Ye Xun] covered her mouth with her hand and laughed out loud.
1:9:22|1:9:27|[Xu Zhuo] picked up the small bowl in front of [Ye Xun] and poured its contents into the dish.
1:9:29|1:9:37|[Huang Da] saw this scene and hesitated for a moment with the cup in his hand, [Ye Xun] looked up at [Huang Da].
1:10:22|1:10:43|[Huang Da] put down the water cup in his hand upon hearing this, while [Ye Xun] stopped eating, biting her lower lip as she watched the scene in front of her. She lowered her head, unable to resist looking up at [Huang Da].
1:11:14|1:11:23|[Xu Zhuo] held [Ye Xun]'s hand and spoke, [Huang Da] bent down to pick up the coins that fell out of the wallet on the ground, then stood up and said to them:
1:11:49|1:12:5|[Ye Xun] stopped talking and [Huang Da] returned to his workplace after leaving the restaurant, where he and his colleagues were cutting renovation equipment. Suddenly, a car drove in, and upon seeing it, [Huang Da] immediately dropped what he was holding and ran towards the house. [Ye Xun] got out of the car and saw [Huang Da] running inside.
1:12:5|1:12:18|After closing the car door, she walked straight into the house.
1:12:55|1:12:59|After saying what she wanted to say, [Ye Xun] left, but turned back unwillingly to look inside the room.
1:12:59|1:13:6|[Huang Da] hid behind the wall and listened to everything [Ye Xun] said. He only came out from behind the wall after [Ye Xun] left.
1:13:12|1:13:23|Xiong pushed the stone and Hu Zi away, and the two picked up their tools to continue working. Xiong turned back to Huang Da and Huang Da put away the tape measure in his hand.
1:13:25|1:13:32|[Huang Da] was at a loss for words when he heard Xiong Ge's words, and Xiong Ge even reminded him before leaving.
1:13:34|1:13:41|[Huang Da] casually agreed with a sentence, then turned and walked to the side to continue working, while [Xu Zhuo] arrived at a 4S store.
1:13:50|1:13:58|[Huang Da] came to the store and found [Xu Zhuo]. He saw [Xu Zhuo] sitting on the sofa inside, gesturing with his hand for him to go outside.
1:13:58|1:14:1|[Xu Zhuo] got up and caught up with him.
1:14:52|1:15:3|After saying that, [Xu Zhuo] turned and left to fetch his car from the shop. [Huang Da] then went back to work, asking his colleagues to leave first before walking to the side.
1:15:16|1:15:38|He dialed a phone number on his cell phone, and upon hearing a voice, he looked up. In the distance, several workers slowly raised a huge banner with a photo of [Ye Xun]. [Huang Da] stood in place, looking up at the photo of [Ye Xun]. [Ye Xun]'s performance was about to begin. She held two tickets in the dressing room and asked the staff to do her a favor by separating the two seats.
1:15:42|1:15:47|[Taozi] grabbed the ticket and walked to the side, holding a pen to write on the back of the ticket.
1:15:47|1:15:55|[Ye Xun] quickly got up and walked towards [Taozi] after seeing her actions.
1:16:13|1:16:20|[Huang Da] arrived at the front desk of the concert hall, picked up the ticket left by [Ye Xun], and found [Xu Zhuo] already seated at his place in the audience.
1:16:21|1:16:37|[Huang Da] walked to the venue after getting the ticket, started looking for the seat number on the ticket. After confirming several rows, he walked through the narrow aisle. When he was about to reach his seat, he saw [Xu Zhuo]. [Xu Zhuo] paused, stood up and made way for him.
1:16:37|1:16:45|[Huang Da] walked over and sat beside him. The two of them looked at each other awkwardly and cautiously, while a spotlight shone on the center of the stage.
1:16:45|1:16:48|Illuminating the piano and a chair on the stage.
1:16:48|1:16:55|[Huang Da] smiled when he saw the chairs on the stage, then he looked down at the ticket in his hand and turned it over.
1:17:2|1:17:26|[Xu Zhuo] turned his head and saw the words on the ticket held by [Huang Da]. At that moment, a door on the side of the stage opened, and applause erupted from the audience below. [Ye Xun] and the pianist, dressed in formal attire, walked to the center of the stage and bowed to the audience. [Huang Da] saw [Ye Xun] getting excited and clapping below as she took the stage. [Ye Xun] sat on the chair, the applause from the audience below ceased, and she entered into the performance mode.
1:17:26|1:17:30|The sound of the piano comes in first, as [Ye Xun] slowly pulls the cello in her hands.
1:17:30|1:17:38|She closed her eyes and devoted herself wholeheartedly, her fingers skillfully sliding on the strings, while the audience below listened carefully.
1:17:38|1:18:2|As the music gradually plays on, [Ye Xun] seems to understand what [Taozi] is saying. It's as if she already has the answer in her heart, with the image of a person constantly in her mind - that person is [Huang Da]. Holding the qin in her hands, she looks towards [Huang Da] in the audience. [Huang Da] smiles back at her and continues to attentively enjoy her performance. [Ye Xun] is lost in memories, thinking back to the day when the dinner ended on a sour note.
1:18:2|1:18:26|After returning home, she carefully unpacked the boxes brought by [Huang Da], only to find a wooden chair inside. She gently touched the back of the chair, slowly slid down to the legs, her eyes filled with a joyful smile. On the chair was a postcard from [Huang Da], she picked it up and gently flipped open the first page.
1:19:20|1:19:25|[Xu Zhuo] picked up his ticket, [Huang Da] froze, there was also a sentence written on his ticket.
1:19:53|1:20:14|[Xu Zhuo] sat on the chair, leaning slightly forward, and bowed to him. On stage, [Ye Xun] recalled everything [Huang Da] had done for her, tears streaming down her face. After the music ended, she slowly raised her head and looked down at the audience.
1:20:14|1:20:21|The audience below applauded one after another, and the auditorium was once again covered with applause, except for [Huang Da] who did not clap.
1:20:21|1:20:31|At this point, his eyes were gradually becoming blurry, tears covering his entire eye sockets, his eyes bloodshot. He held back for a moment, but tears eventually welled up and streamed down his face.
1:20:31|1:20:55|But thinking about what [Xu Zhuo] said would make [Ye Xun] happy, he smiled again. After [Ye Xun] left the backstage and ran towards the agreed meeting point with [Huang Da], [Huang Da] turned around and applauded when he heard footsteps. The performance just now was fantastic. [Ye Xun] reached out and tightly held [Huang Da]'s hand. [Huang Da] hesitated for a moment, but eventually withdrew his hand.
1:21:23|1:21:39|[Huang Da] smiled and finished speaking to [Xu Zhuo], then walked past [Ye Xun] and continued forward. [Ye Xun] couldn't stop her tears from flowing down, and after [Huang Da] turned and left, he felt extremely sad in his heart. He tried hard to suppress his emotions, not wanting his tears to fall. He bravely held back his tears and walked forward.
1:21:45|1:21:53|[Ye Xun] remained motionless in the position [Huang Da] left until [Xu Zhuo] took out a ring and grabbed her left hand.
1:21:54|1:22:1|[Ye Xun] glanced down at the ring in [Xu Zhuo]'s hand, and [Xu Zhuo] saw that she didn't refuse as he slid the ring onto her ring finger.
1:22:1|1:22:8|[Ye Xun] tears streamed down her face, she forced a bitter smile, the current situation was completely unexpected to her, she didn't know what to do.
1:22:9|1:22:17|Seeing [Ye Xun] like this, [Xu Zhuo] embraced him tightly, and [Ye Xun] leaned against his chest, unable to stop sobbing.
1:22:17|1:22:37|The next day, [Xu Zhuo] brought [Ye Xun] to a wedding venue. In the hall of the venue, many couples were choosing wedding dresses. At the next table, people were happily selecting dress styles, while [Ye Xun] sat coldly and calmly in her seat, showing no interest at all. Meanwhile, [Huang Da] was once again going on a blind date. Brother Xiong introduced him to a girl.
1:22:37|1:23:0|However, at the dining table, [Huang Da] appeared somewhat indifferent. He was unwilling to get to know the blind date, just nodding along without much interest. Xiongge tried to liven up the atmosphere, while [Ye Xun] at the wedding venue looked up at the ceiling. When it came to ordering food, the dating [Huang Da] stood up and left the table. The girl looked puzzled at Xiongge, who tried to call back [Huang Da], but he left without turning back.
1:23:0|1:23:13|[Ye Xun] tried on one wedding dress after another at the wedding venue, while [Huang Da] stood blankly outside the mall. Xiong Ge sent away the blind date he introduced to [Huang Da], put his hands on his hips and took a deep breath, then walked to [Huang Da] and said to him:
1:23:28|1:23:36|Brother Xiong put away the matchmaking booklet in his hand and looked at [Huang Da].
1:23:45|1:23:58|Xiong Ge walked away angrily, then quickly turned back. He stuffed a letter into [Huang Da]'s hand, handed something to [Huang Da], and then left again.
1:23:58|1:24:8|[Huang Da] quickly regained his composure and opened the envelope, taking out a letter from inside. He read it carefully, realizing that the letter was written to him by [Ye Xun].
1:24:52|1:24:59|[Huang Da] walked on the road and heard [Ye Xun]'s voice coming from a taxi. He immediately leaned against the taxi window to watch the news footage playing inside.
1:25:0|1:25:9|[Ye Xun] and [Xu Zhuo] are being interviewed by reporters. While [Xu Zhuo] is responding to the questions, [Ye Xun] can't help but bite her lower lip, a scene noticed by [Huang Da].
1:25:9|1:25:15|On [Ye Xun]'s wedding day, she stood in the church corridor in her wedding gown, looking dazed.
1:25:16|1:25:28|[Huang Da] was sitting alone in a dimly lit room. Every now and then, applause and shouts could be heard from outside the room. Huang Da nervously swallowed, then stood up.
1:25:31|1:25:36|[Ye Xun] leaned against the wall and casually nodded.
1:28:15|1:28:17|The two hosts leave the stage.
1:28:17|1:28:34|The spotlight on the stage converged on [Huang Da], who held a microphone in his hand, raised his head and sang the love declaration by Qi Qin to the audience below.
1:28:59|1:29:16|He picked up the remote control and turned off the TV when he saw it, then walked to the side. [Ye Xun] followed with the hem of her wedding dress in hand, almost catching up. As she was about to catch up, she slowed down her pace. [Xu Zhuo] noticed that she slowly stopped behind him, and [Ye Xun] grabbed [Xu Zhuo]'s arm from behind.
1:29:30|1:29:35|[Xu Zhuo] frowned and turned to look at [Ye Xun] upon hearing her words.
1:29:42|1:29:46|[Ye Xun] pulled [Xu Zhuo]'s hand and sat on the nearby bench.
1:30:20|1:30:26|[Ye Xun] recalls everything [Huang Da] did for her, spending all his money to buy lottery tickets and confessing his love to her on the street.
1:30:26|1:30:32|The ring bought for 20,000 yuan was lost, and the two searched together on the beach, finally finding a bolt.
1:30:32|1:30:41|While practicing the cello, [Huang Da] was silently accompanying her. In order to make a chair for her, he tried his best to measure the dimensions. Holding back tears, [Xu Zhuo] said to her:
1:30:50|1:30:57|73 years ago, [Xu Zhuo] recounted the car accident from three years ago to [Ye Xun], who looked at the familiar yet unfamiliar [Xu Zhuo] in front of her.
1:31:21|1:31:28|Xu Zhuo, who climbed out of the car, ran forward regardless of everything.
1:31:40|1:32:4|[Ye Xun] gently squeezed out a smile, then reached out and hugged [Xu Zhuo]. [Xu Zhuo] patted her back with one hand, responding to her hug. After [Ye Xun] let go of [Xu Zhuo] and stood up, she smiled at him and then left with the train of her wedding dress. Tears filled [Xu Zhuo]'s eyes as he lowered his head in disappointment, while [Ye Xun] passed by the wedding scene.
1:32:20|1:32:24|[Huang Da] has just finished singing on stage, and the audience below burst into applause.
1:32:45|1:32:52|The numbers on the big screen started spinning, [Huang Da] and the host turned to look at the screen. After spinning for a while, the numbers finally stopped.
1:33:7|1:33:15|[Ye Xun] shouted a sentence from the high platform towards the audience below. The host and audience on site, including [Huang Da], all looked up in surprise at [Ye Xun].
1:33:15|1:33:24|Huang Da then handed the microphone to the host and rushed towards Ye Xun. He stumbled and almost tripped on the steps, but managed to regain his balance and looked at Ye Xun.
1:33:26|1:33:33|[Huang Da] is holding back tears.
1:33:33|1:33:58|[Ye Xun] nodded quickly with tears in her eyes, then bent down into [Huang Da]'s arms. [Huang Da] hugged [Ye Xun] tightly, and the audience around them burst into applause. The host also clapped and congratulated them. Just as [Huang Da] was about to let go of [Ye Xun] and run off the stage, she grabbed his hand and reached into her chest, pulling out the bolt from inside. With tears streaming down her face, she kissed the bolt and then handed it to [Huang Da].
1:33:58|1:34:3|[Ye Xun] reaches out her right hand to [Huang Da], who gently places the cap on her ring finger.
1:34:3|1:34:13|Then [Huang Da] pulled [Ye Xun] into his arms, holding her tightly. Everyone at the scene witnessed this proposal of love, applauding for their love.
1:34:13|1:34:20|Many female viewers cast envious glances as their romantic proposal was broadcast live on the show.
