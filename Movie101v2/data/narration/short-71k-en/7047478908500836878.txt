0:2:49|0:2:57|The boss looked at the copper coins in Bai Ling's hand, then turned to look at the children sitting around in a circle, their pitiful big eyes also staring at him.
0:2:57|0:3:2|The boss sighed, took the copper coins and left. [Bai Ling] sat down on the chair with a embarrassed look on her face.
0:3:35|0:3:43|The other children looked back curiously, while [Bai Ling] turned around in confusion, only to see a big man with a full beard lying on the table snoring loudly.
0:4:16|0:4:26|An armed robber with a goatee slowly approaches the big man who is still asleep. He walks up quickly, pats the big man on the back with the back of his knife, and shouts. But the big man lying down still doesn't move. The robber with the goatee becomes angry.
0:4:26|0:4:33|With a forceful push, [Ma Feng] managed to wake up the big man who was drooling all over the table, but he still showed no response.
0:5:2|0:5:8|After speaking, the big man punched the man with a goatee in the face twice, with the final heavy blow hitting his temple and knocking him to the ground.
0:5:8|0:5:18|Bai Ling whimpered in fear, then was lifted up by the big man. He threw punches fiercely one after another, before finally tossing her towards a nearby wooden table.
0:5:28|0:5:36|The big man stopped hitting until he was exhausted, and the other bandits watched him without daring to move.
0:5:37|0:5:49|At this moment, the man with the moustache on the ground already had a swollen nose and bruised face, with blood and saliva mixing at the corners of his mouth. Seeing this, the other bandits swallowed nervously, and the closest one drew his knife and swung it towards the big man, who slightly dodged and brushed past the blade with his back.
0:5:49|0:5:53|He then seized the hand of the person holding the knife and defended against attacks from the other side.
0:5:55|0:6:2|[Bai Ling] instructed the children to crouch in the corner. Then, she looked up at the big man and saw him elbowing with force, hitting the leader of the robbers.
0:6:3|0:6:10|He then reversed his hand holding the knife behind his back, and smoothly twisted him to kneel in front. Unexpectedly, another fearless knife-wielding person rushed forward at this moment.
0:6:10|0:6:16|The big man calmly dodged three knives, then grabbed the robber's arm and threw him straight onto the table.
0:6:16|0:6:21|He grabbed the man's leg and spun around, effortlessly throwing him out of the wall.
0:6:21|0:6:28|The man could be heard wailing in the air, then landed heavily on the grass, leaving the other two to rush forward indignantly.
0:6:28|0:6:36|The big man grabbed one with each hand, and in the blink of an eye, he twisted and crossed the hands of the two men holding knives. The two men, who had no resistance at all, were sat down on a bench by the big man.
0:6:36|0:6:42|He tightly held both arms and then forcefully slapped one of them on the buttocks.
0:6:46|0:6:52|The children hiding nearby saw this scene and exclaimed in amazement. The big man, upon seeing this, pointed at the bandit's butt and beckoned to the children.
0:6:58|0:7:5|The big man grabbed their arms and leaped backwards, pulling the two down to the ground. Then he searched their pockets and found a silver dollar, saying.
0:7:7|0:7:13|The boss hiding by the stove caught the thrown silver dollar, while the big man walked over, put on his hat, and prepared to leave with his luggage.
0:7:20|0:7:26|He took out a few copper coins from his purse and threw them over, only to see the coins land perfectly in the dough, lined up in a row.
0:7:40|0:7:49|[Bai Ling] hadn't had time to explain yet, the big man walked out the door, he turned and leaped onto the horse, then quickly took out a cloth to cover his eyes, skillfully tying a knot behind his head.
0:7:49|0:8:0|The figure of the big man was getting farther and farther away from the inn. The children rushed out of the inn and stood at the door, watching the big man's back as he left. [Bai Ling] also stood behind with two young children.
0:8:0|0:8:7|The children's eyes were filled with admiration, unwilling to look away.
0:8:10|0:8:17|The little girl's words made the other children burst into laughter. The boy called Mantou nodded with half a noodle in his mouth.
0:8:17|0:8:25|[Bai Ling] stared at the figure on the horseback, lost in thought. At this moment, the blindfolded man shouted at the steed beneath him, galloping forward.
0:8:41|0:8:49|The soldiers on horseback with guns surrounded the civilians, while a flag embroidered with a dragon fluttered in the sky.
0:8:49|0:8:56|At this moment, the imprint of the brush splurged down, covering the flag, and the bold and powerful calligraphy of the title "City of Danger" gradually emerged.
0:8:56|0:9:7|Crossing over the towering mountain peaks, a small town appears at the foot of the distant mountains, with clear river water flowing past nearby houses towards the distance. Houses are scattered on both sides of the riverbank, this is Pucheng.
0:9:7|0:9:15|The street was bustling with people coming and going, each household busy with their own affairs. The signboard of Pucheng hung at the city gate, adding a touch of solemnity to the small town.
0:9:15|0:9:22|The sound of approaching horse hooves grew louder and louder, as a man rode in on horseback.
0:9:24|0:9:31|Yang Kenan walked into the courtyard with his hands full.
0:9:33|0:9:40|The wife inside the house couldn't hide her excitement upon hearing the news of her husband's return.
0:9:57|0:10:5|The henchmen looked at each other in confusion after hearing the instructions, while the curly-haired man on the side spoke up.
0:10:48|0:10:54|Seeing the refugees kneeling down one after another, [Yang Kenan] couldn't bear it in his heart. He turned around and looked at the people around him, and said.
0:11:20|0:11:26|The people around frowned in silence, while the man with glasses shouted at the crowd.
0:11:39|0:11:42|[Yang Kenan] looked at everyone, with a relieved smile on his face.
0:11:42|0:11:48|The man with glasses suddenly shouted towards the distance.
0:12:20|0:12:31|After [Bai Ling] explained the ins and outs of the matter to everyone, [Yang Kenan]'s wife comforted him.
0:12:31|0:12:37|After she finished speaking, [Bai Ling] looked at her with gratitude and gently responded.
0:12:47|0:12:58|Suddenly, a restless noise came from outside, and [Yang Kenan] immediately stood up. His men beside him immediately went out. At this moment, a group of people on horseback brazenly broke into Pucheng at the city gate.
0:12:58|0:13:14|The roadside stall, which was not cleaned up in time, was hit and flew into the air, with various foods scattered all over the ground. The group of people continued to charge forward without stopping. They rode all the way to the door of [Yang Kenan]. The leader, with slicked-back hair and open collar, looked around before dismounting, followed by the others.
0:14:0|0:14:4|Suddenly, his fist came forward, [Yang Kenan] calmly blocked the fast punch and flipped backward.
0:14:4|0:14:11|Seizing the opportunity while the opponent was rolling, he leaped and kicked the man to the ground.
0:14:18|0:14:26|The henchmen picked up their weapons and approached menacingly. [Yang Kenan], however, turned and walked away, whipping his long whip behind him.
0:14:26|0:14:34|Next, he quickly grabbed [Wang Weihu] who was charging towards him and entangled him with the whip. In the midst of the chaos, a voice suddenly shouted out.
0:15:23|0:15:29|The sound of a horse neighing from behind attracted everyone's attention, and they all turned to look behind them.
0:15:29|0:15:42|A horse carrying a person wearing a bamboo hat slowly approached the crowd. Everyone made way for them. The horse stopped in the middle, but the person sitting on it showed no reaction. Children could vaguely see the person's face.
0:15:47|0:15:54|The man riding the horse turned out to be the big man who helped out at the inn with a knife, but at this moment he was still in a dreamland, completely unaware of the gaze of the crowd.
0:15:54|0:16:3|At this moment, the figure on the horseback gradually slanted and fell straight to the ground. The children around laughed and played, while the blind man on the ground groaned in pain and rolled over.
0:16:5|0:16:12|He pulled down the cloth strip over his eyes, looked at [Ma Feng] beside him, and said.
0:16:21|0:16:29|[Yang Kenan] looked at [Mrs. Liu] with confusion, and [Mrs. Liu] patted the boss's shoulder and said.
0:16:44|0:16:54|The children who were shouting suddenly fell silent, looking at the Sun Wukong in front of them with a hint of fear in their eyes. The big man suddenly started to grin and make faces, imitating Sun Wukong scratching his ears and cheeks.
0:16:54|0:16:59|The children then laughed heartily again. The big man turned around helplessly and picked up the reins on the side.
0:16:59|0:17:4|[Yang Kenan] looked at this scene and smiled, while the big man looked at him and pulled on the reins.
0:17:5|0:17:10|At this moment, [Yang Kenan] put away his smile, his brows furrowed, silently observing the movements of the big man.
0:17:12|0:17:15|The man looked around and then sat on the chair, waiting.
0:17:15|0:17:22|The snoring sound echoed in the room again. At this moment, a figure walked into the shop, picked up the calendar on the wall, and covered the sleeping man with it.
0:17:22|0:17:31|He then walked to the table, picked up a pair of scissors, but when he saw a larger pair next to him, he decisively put down the one in his hand and picked up the other one to strike the big man.
0:17:31|0:17:36|The big man, who was still half asleep, looked at [Yang Kenan] in confusion.
0:17:54|0:18:2|He picked it up himself and talked while picking it up.
0:19:17|0:19:23|Yang Kenan stopped the scissors in his hand and blew on them.
0:19:48|0:19:58|Upon hearing the ambiguous response from [Yang Kenan], [Ma Feng] uneasily sat up from his chair. He recalled the strange experiences of the day and then picked up the mirror next to him, slowly moving it in front of his eyes.
0:19:58|0:20:4|Admiring his neatly trimmed beard, he exclaimed in amazement and began to appreciate his handsome face.
0:20:4|0:20:12|[Ma Feng] held up the mirror, raised his chin, raised an eyebrow, and then smirked. He glanced at the door and then spoke to the mirror.
0:20:12|0:20:17|After speaking, he touched his beard and hesitated to put down the mirror.
0:20:17|0:20:27|Night falls, the moonlight is obscured by dark clouds, and the cicadas' chirping sounds particularly noisy in the quiet small town. At this moment, [Ma Feng] is lying on a wooden table, sound asleep.
0:20:27|0:20:34|[Bai Ling] looked at the sleeping [Ma Feng] from a distance, her steps forward becoming hesitant. After a while, she gathered her courage and walked up to [Ma Feng].
0:20:34|0:20:43|Her expression became very conflicted. Then, she hesitantly called out. But at this moment, [Ma Feng] showed no sign of waking up, and gradually started snoring.
0:20:43|0:20:53|[Bai Ling] had to take a few slow steps forward, bent down and raised her voice to shout. [Ma Feng] was startled and sat up abruptly.
0:21:47|0:21:52|After speaking, he immediately lay back down, turned his body around, and faced away from [Bai Ling]. However, [Bai Ling] remained standing in place, not leaving.
0:21:52|0:22:0|For the safety of the children, she no longer cared about so much. Then she took another step forward and said.
0:22:32|0:22:35|[Bai Ling] shook her head helplessly, saying nothing more.
0:22:35|0:22:40|[Ma Feng] stood up to look her over, making a satisfied clicking sound with his mouth.
0:22:42|0:22:49|[Bai Ling] looked up at [Ma Feng] and found him staring at her with a serious expression.
0:22:54|0:22:58|[Bai Ling] slipped away from his arm while talking, and [Ma Feng] leaned against the pillar and smiled triumphantly.
0:22:58|0:23:4|Bai Ling, whose heart was racing with fear, turned and said.
0:23:13|0:23:29|After speaking, [Ma Feng] kept looking at [Bai Ling] across from him. He saw her blinking her bright eyes, smiling at him, and then she left without saying anything. Watching [Bai Ling] walking away, [Ma Feng]'s gaze gradually softened, but his heart was filled with mixed emotions.
0:23:29|0:23:33|At this moment, [Yang Kenan] sat on a long whip, looking at the child sleeping in his arms.
0:23:33|0:23:41|At this moment, Bai Ling walked over with a painting and sat on the bed. She looked down at the child and asked softly.
0:23:54|0:24:5|Wife pointed to the self-portrait of the child and couldn't help but laugh. The child in her arms frowned as if about to be awakened. The wife immediately gestured for him to lower his voice. [Yang Kenan] suppressed his laughter, but his body couldn't help but tremble.
0:24:5|0:24:11|His wife gave him a reproachful look and gently patted his back. Then she leaned over and pressed her face against their daughter's head.
0:24:11|0:24:15|At this moment, [Yang Kenan] held his wife's hand even tighter.
0:24:15|0:24:22|The small room was enveloped in the happiness of a family of three, with the light still on inside while the night outside grew darker and darker.
0:24:22|0:24:29|In the early hours of the morning, Pucheng gradually emerges in the darkness, with only the river flowing into the distance still clearly visible.
0:24:29|0:24:36|The sky was covered with dark clouds, and thick fog almost obscured the entire mountain top. The sound of hooves, coming from an unknown direction, shattered the tranquility of the moment.
0:24:36|0:24:44|A man dressed in white robes, riding a horse, leisurely approaches the city gate. As he walks in, he looks around in all directions.
0:24:44|0:24:51|A wooden board on the door was lifted from the inside, and [Zhou Susu] walked out with a bundle on her back, urging someone to hurry up.
0:24:56|0:24:58|The children walked out one after another with their belongings.
0:24:58|0:25:4|At this point, the man has already ridden into the streets of the city.
0:25:10|0:25:13|The children quickly put away their luggage and went inside to eat noodles.
0:25:13|0:25:15|A stranger calmly observes his surroundings.
0:25:15|0:25:25|Cousin Ma Feng, who was still organizing luggage behind the carriage, heard a voice and glanced outside. Then, he walked up to the man and greeted him with a smile.
0:25:35|0:25:41|The man on horseback wearing sunglasses looked around and then turned his head, looking at the shopkeeper with a smile that was not quite a smile.
0:25:41|0:25:48|He didn't speak, just nodded slightly. Then, the hospitable Brother Liao invited the man inside.
0:25:50|0:25:57|A man walked into the house past the children eating noodles. Upstairs, [Bai Ling] heard the frantic barking of a little dog.
0:26:55|0:27:4|The man turned his head and looked back, with a cold smile on his face. After [Bai Ling] saw his face clearly, a terrible scene flashed in her mind.
0:27:25|0:27:33|After his cousin left, the man turned to look at Bai Ling standing far behind. Bai Ling frowned as she looked at Cao Shaolin.
0:27:33|0:27:40|Breathing heavily, eyes on the verge of tears, then answered...
0:27:41|0:27:48|[Cao Shaolin] spoke while placing his hand on the head of the boy who was still asleep on the side, while his other hand lifted the teapot and poured it into the cup. [Bai Ling] looked pale.
0:27:48|0:27:53|She slowly walked up to [Cao Shaolin] and then lowered her head to plead.
0:28:4|0:28:9|After speaking, he stared at [Bai Ling] waiting for an answer. [Bai Ling] looked up and glanced at the child sleeping next to [Cao Shaolin].
0:28:9|0:28:14|Then she shook her head silently. After that, she started to sob helplessly.
0:28:44|0:28:48|[Bai Ling] had tears on her face, shaking her head continuously. Her lips trembled, but she insisted on speaking.
0:29:20|0:29:26|Upon hearing this, [Bai Ling] looked at him with red eyes, only to see [Cao Shaolin] turn his head and say to his cousin who was making noodles outside.
0:29:27|0:29:33|At this moment, Cousin Bai Ling is outside fishing noodles from the pot, completely unaware of the danger inside the house.
0:29:33|0:29:44|[Cao Shaolin] smiled as he touched the boy's head, looking outside. [Bai Ling] with tears in her eyes, looked at her cousin outside without saying a word. He leaned in close to [Bai Ling]'s face.
0:29:50|0:29:54|Outside the house, Cousin is stirring the noodles in the pot with chopsticks. [Bai Ling] watches him anxiously, but she has no way to help.
0:29:54|0:30:7|Looking at the cousin who came in with a tray of noodles and a smile, she was so scared that she could hardly breathe at this moment. She gasped for breath with her mouth open, but the cousin didn't notice anything unusual at all, and quickly walked in to greet her.
0:30:9|0:30:18|[Cao Shaolin] lowered his head to look at the noodles on the table, only to see the smile on his face gradually disappear. He hesitated to take a closer look and couldn't believe it - there was no beef noodles with scallions in front of him.
0:30:18|0:30:25|Bai Ling on the side saw this scene and finally let out a sigh of relief. She looked up and saw Cao Shaolin, who was stunned at the moment.
0:30:25|0:30:33|The other person glared at her angrily, then looked down at the bowl and let out a sinister laugh.
0:30:36|0:30:42|Cousin Zhang, who was shot, turned around with his mouth open, and [Yang Kenan] inside the house heard the gunshot and walked outside.
0:30:42|0:30:50|Yang Kenan's men rushed out, and at this moment, his cousin who was shot three times directly fell to the ground, blood flowing from the corner of his mouth to the back of his head.
0:30:50|0:30:57|The boy sleeping on the table heard a noise, groggily got up, and [Bai Ling] looked at her cousin lying on the ground, staring with wide eyes unable to speak.
0:30:57|0:31:3|She glared fiercely at [Cao Shaolin], who was still laughing heartily, and then rushed up and shouted.
0:31:15|0:31:27|Gunshots rang out again quickly, [Bai Ling] turned around and saw Big Yuan lying on the ground covered in blood. She screamed in despair, tears streaming down her face, then she shouted at [Cao Shaolin].
0:31:35|0:31:42|[Cao Shaolin] smiled and put the gun into [Bai Ling]'s mouth, pulled the trigger, blood dripping from [Bai Ling]'s mouth as she fell to the floor by the table, the gun was already out of bullets.
0:31:42|0:31:45|[Cao Shaolin] kept pressing the attack relentlessly.
0:31:45|0:31:52|At this moment, [Yang Kenan] kicked down the wooden board and rushed into the room with his men. Everyone was shocked to see the body on the ground.
0:31:53|0:31:57|At this moment, the flustered [Cao Shaolin] lowered the gun in his hand and immediately placed it on the table.
0:31:57|0:32:2|A group of people surrounded [Cao Shaolin], while the henchmen on the side moved the gun on the table to a distance.
0:32:2|0:32:9|[Yang Kenan] walked towards [Cao Shaolin] while looking at the bodies on the ground. His men squatted down and placed their fingers in front of the large round nose.
0:32:9|0:32:22|Yang Kenan's wife looked at the bullet hole behind Bai Ling's head, then everyone involuntarily cast angry glances towards Cao Shaolin. At this moment, as Yang Kenan stepped forward, Cao Shaolin showed a look of innocence.
0:32:22|0:32:28|He looked around in horror, slowly backing away as he stared at the furious [Yang Kenan] in front of him.
0:32:41|0:32:47|The children that [Yang Kenan] saved were sitting on the steps crying. His men were comforting them.
0:32:47|0:32:54|Ma Feng, who was unaware of what had happened, furrowed his brows at the scene in front of him. Then, he turned to look in the direction where the crowd was rushing to.
0:32:54|0:32:57|At this moment, there were continuous roars coming from [Yang Kenan]'s courtyard.
0:33:4|0:33:11|The people are now crowded in the courtyard, raising their fists and vehemently denouncing the murderer in front of them, [Cao Shaolin], who is kneeling on the ground, looking somewhat bewildered at the angry expressions of everyone.
0:33:13|0:33:22|In the crowd, a woman angrily rushes up the steps, ready to hit someone. Her henchmen quickly step in to stop her, while two strangers on horseback at the city gate see the chaos in Pucheng and immediately turn and ride out of the city.
0:33:51|0:33:57|[Ma Feng] looked at the bodies of [Bai Ling] and others next door, then turned to look at [Yang Kenan] standing up.
0:34:24|0:34:30|There were voices of opposition, and [Ma Feng] glanced at the person.
0:34:39|0:34:47|After Yang Kenan finished speaking, he stared into Cao Shaolin's eyes and then walked to the front.
0:35:12|0:35:35|[Cao Shaolin] was pressed up from the ground by two henchmen, suddenly, a pair of hands violently pushed away the person squeezed behind. The woman was slapped to the side, and the crowd in front of her quickly made way, only to see a man in black standing in the middle, with a somewhat domineering attitude. Seeing this unexpected guest, [Yang Kenan] also became cautious. At this moment, [Ma Feng] in the distance saw the change in the expression of the man in black immediately.
0:35:35|0:35:41|At this moment, the man in black walked forward without changing his expression, and [Yang Kenan]'s two subordinates immediately ran over to intercept.
0:35:48|0:35:53|[Yang Kenan] turned to look at [Cao Shaolin], who was being held down by someone. The man in black took a step forward, but was stopped.
0:35:54|0:36:6|The man in black swung his sleeves and pushed the two people blocking his way aside. His followers immediately stepped forward to fight with him, but the man in black's punches and palms were as fast as lightning. After a few rounds, the followers quickly couldn't keep up, and one of them was a female follower.
0:36:6|0:36:12|Seeing the situation, [Ma Feng] rushed forward and unexpectedly grabbed the belt of the person, lifting and spinning them around effortlessly. The henchmen preparing to attack on the side were all knocked aside.
0:36:12|0:36:21|Another defiant henchman rushed forward, but the man in black quickly twisted his arm tightly under his armpit with just a few moves, then he knelt down and spoke.
0:36:27|0:36:35|Shortly after, a group of soldiers with long spears entered the door. The people in the courtyard were surrounded. [Boss Liu], who was sitting inside, was immediately frightened and stood up.
0:36:35|0:36:42|The man in black let go of [Yang Kenan]'s hand and stood up.
0:36:47|0:36:52|The people in the courtyard began to discuss anxiously after hearing the news, with everyone's expression becoming tense. [Ma Feng] furrowed his brow and observed the situation inside.
0:37:40|0:37:48|[Zhang Wu] looked at the young marshal in confusion, then [Cao Shaolin] spoke.
0:37:49|0:37:56|After speaking, tearful [Cao Shaolin] gave him a meaningful look, and [Zhang Wu] hesitated for a moment before lowering his head and speaking.
0:37:56|0:38:5|He then looked up at the pitiful young master, and turned to [Yang Kenan]. [Yang Kenan] looked back at [Zhang Wu] defiantly.
0:38:5|0:38:12|The hand still gripping the neck did not let go. [Zhang Wu] turned around and said to everyone.
0:38:23|0:38:36|Standing behind [Brother Liao], hearing these words, rolled his eyes and almost fainted, and the person next to him immediately supported him. The people below all looked uneasy, [Yang Kenan] looked around with a grim face, still not letting go, holding [Cao Shaolin]'s neck.
0:38:36|0:38:47|[Ma Feng] leaned against the pillar, with his hands crossed over his chest, looking at [Zhang Wu] with an extremely cold gaze. [Zhang Wu] also noticed this mournful look, and as he turned to see [Ma Feng], a hint of surprise appeared in his eyes.
0:38:47|0:38:55|But he quickly regained his indifferent look and walked out of the courtyard without looking back. [Ma Feng] looked pensive, watching [Zhang Wu] walk away.
0:38:55|0:39:1|Turning his head, he looked inside worriedly at [Yang Kenan], while at this moment, [Cao Shaolin] had already been choked red in the face.
0:39:1|0:39:6|Captain Yang watched as the person with the gun walked away before letting go.
0:39:16|0:39:23|Captain Yang finished speaking and pushed hard. [Cao Shaolin] showed a look of extreme grief, watching the arrogant and pretentious demon in front of everyone, Captain Yang was filled with anger. At this moment,
0:39:25|0:39:31|The people below gathered around waiting for Captain Yang's solution. [Boss Liu] stepped forward and said.
0:39:58|0:40:5|Boss Liu turned around and walked out, with someone supporting him.
0:40:7|0:40:12|Captain Yang, with a look of anger in his eyes after hearing the provocative words, addressed the people in the courtyard.
0:40:18|0:40:29|But the people of Pucheng still stood in place with worried expressions on their faces. At this moment, Colonel [Zhang] rode back to the camp of the Cao army with the crowd. At the entrance of the large camp, there were rows of soldiers on guard. Colonel [Zhang] walked in through the gate,
0:40:29|0:40:34|He immediately dismounted and walked towards the tent. Two of his men caught up from behind and said.
0:40:47|0:40:53|He turned his head and continued to speak to them. The two remained silent, and [Major Zhang] continued speaking.
0:41:22|0:41:27|After speaking, the two of them looked angrily into the distance. One of them rolled their eyes and then smirked at their partner beside them.
0:41:27|0:41:32|In the town of Pucheng at this moment, [Ma Feng] is placing his neatly packed luggage on the horse.
0:41:32|0:41:40|He was tidying up while looking around the small town with a touch of life. As he turned his head, he saw Yang Kenan's wife standing in front of him.
0:41:44|0:41:51|After speaking, [Ma Feng] turned his head to continue organizing other things. [Yang Kenan]'s wife didn't say anything more, she walked straight to [Ma Feng]'s side and handed him what she was holding.
0:42:0|0:42:11|[Ma Feng] looked at her in confusion, then looked down at the letter in her hand. He reached out and took the letter, but did not open it. He silently looked at the neatly folded letter. [Yang Kenan]'s wife spoke.
0:42:14|0:42:21|After speaking, she nodded at [Ma Feng] and walked away. Perplexed, [Ma Feng] looked at her retreating figure, recalling the words she had just said.
0:42:21|0:42:30|Later, he looked down at the letter in his hand, hesitant to open it. At noon, [Ma Feng] went to a deserted place to open the letter.
0:43:13|0:43:19|At this moment, [Ma Feng] sat alone on a small hill made of wine barrels, holding a letter from [Bai Ling], his eyes gazing into the distance.
0:43:19|0:43:26|The one she was most worried about in her heart turned out to be her student. Unfortunately, the letter should have been handed to him by [Bai Ling] herself.
0:43:27|0:43:36|Before long, thunder rumbled and rain poured from the sky. At that moment, [Yang Kenan] was sitting in a porridge shop drinking tea, and he turned to see [Ma Feng] feeding a horse across the street.
0:43:36|0:43:43|Ma Feng felt the gaze and looked over, the two of them stared at each other from a distance for a while, then Yang Kenan raised his eyebrows at Ma Feng.
0:43:43|0:43:50|[Ma Feng] smiled and looked at him before walking over. Then, the two sat down facing each other and started talking.
0:43:59|0:44:5|He blocked the wine glass, then raised the tea cup and said. They both raised their hands in a gesture, then each tilted their heads back and drank.
0:44:5|0:44:13|[Ma Feng] put down the wine glass and said. [Yang Kenan] smiled and looked at him. [Ma Feng] lowered his head, looked at the wine glass, and continued to ask.
0:44:29|0:44:36|After speaking, [Yang Kenan] looked firmly at [Ma Feng] across from him. [Ma Feng], who was chewing something, avoided his gaze and looked into the distance. Then he spoke.
0:45:4|0:45:10|After speaking, [Yang Kenan] picked up the tea cup again and drank it all. [Ma Feng] looked at him, with a hint of respect in his eyes.
0:45:10|0:45:18|Later, he filled his glass with wine again and drank it heartily. Afterwards, [Ma Feng] arrived at [Yang Kenan]'s house, where the children of Shitoucheng were sitting around the table eating noodles.
0:45:18|0:45:25|Yang Kenan's wife looked at them with concern in her eyes, Ma Feng looked at these young faces and said to Yang Kenan.
0:45:30|0:45:37|Seeing the puzzled look in [Yang Kenan]'s eyes, [Ma Feng] didn't know how to explain. He sighed and said.
0:45:46|0:45:52|After Ma Feng left, Yang Kenan, who had realized something, raised his eyebrows at his wife beside him, as if waiting for her response.
0:46:2|0:46:10|At this moment, Yang Kenan's henchman Guangzi arrived at the prison where Cao Shaolin was held to deliver water, only to see Cao Shaolin sitting inside with his eyes tightly closed, silent.
0:46:10|0:46:14|Guangzai squatted down and shouted at the untouched food in front of him.
0:46:15|0:46:22|Cao Shaolin opened his eyes after hearing it, revealing a fierce look, Bai Ling glanced at him, put down the water, and then picked up the food to leave.
0:46:29|0:46:36|[Ma Feng] completely ignored [Cao Shaolin]'s crazy talk and walked away. At this moment, a white shadow of a knife appeared, and a group of black-clothed people were moving quickly.
0:46:41|0:46:54|Guangzi glanced back at him and walked out. At this time, a group of black-clothed men were on the roof of Yang Kenan's house, and the two who did not obey Zhang Wu's management were among them, just seen by Guangzi who had just walked out.
0:46:55|0:47:6|Shortly after, he immediately threw the bowl and chopsticks in his hand to the side, picked up the long pole next to him and shouted. [Guangzai] rushed out with the long pole, only to find a dark figure suddenly appearing on the roof behind him.
0:47:6|0:47:15|The man somersaulted and struck down with the knife heavily. Sensing the killing intent, Bai Ling picked up a long pole to block it, exchanged a few moves with the man, and the onlookers saw the man being defeated, falling down.
0:47:15|0:47:27|[Brother Guang] had no choice but to face two opponents alone. At this moment, the brothers in the room rushed out. Seeing this, the men in black scattered and engaged with them. Surrounded by several people, [Brother Guang] was trapped in the middle, with the men in black standing in front of him, asking.
0:47:30|0:47:37|The henchmen behind them, upon hearing this, became angry and swung their knives to attack. [Guangzai] struggled to cope and was stabbed from both sides at the same time.
0:47:38|0:47:49|At this moment, [Guangzai], with his body pierced, spits out blood and is kicked out by someone. His brother roars in anger and rushes forward to fight with a knife against that person, while another brother, holding two knives, is still entangled with two men in black.
0:47:49|0:47:53|He dodged left and right, swiftly spinning the single knife in his hand, looking for an opportunity to strike.
0:47:53|0:48:1|The junior sister who came in from outside the courtyard, holding a long-handled short-blade knife, was seen quickly spinning the long handle, and the front short blade also spun faster and faster.
0:48:1|0:48:12|She then swung the long handle and hit the black man's neck, knocking him to the ground. At this point, the brother with the single knife was already running out of strength. After struggling to block several attacks, he unexpectedly left an opening.
0:48:12|0:48:22|The two men across simultaneously flew up and kicked hard, unable to support themselves and fell backwards. He used a single knife to prop up his body backwards and flipped back to the ground. At this time, the black-clothed assassin who was targeting Guangzi had already gone berserk.
0:48:22|0:48:31|He swung his knife and struck again, pushing the person blocking his way aside. Watching the junior sister still struggling beside him, he charged forward again with the blood-stained big knife.
0:48:31|0:48:38|Junior Sister managed to dodge several attacks, but was ultimately kicked into a pile of debris. Captain [Yang Kenan] hurriedly arrived in the courtyard with a weapon in hand.
0:48:38|0:48:47|What was seen was Guangzi lying on the ground, covered in blood. When he turned to look at the villain in front of him, the sadness in his eyes instantly turned into anger, and the villain looked at Captain [Yang Kenan] and said.
0:48:50|0:49:7|Captain [Yang Kenan] stared at the opponent, with what seemed like anger burning in his eyes. His hand holding the short axe trembled slightly as he approached step by step. The villain opposite him cautiously watched, only to see Captain [Yang Kenan] swiftly pick up the short axe and strike. With each swing, it seemed like he was exerting all his strength. The villain kept retreating, while Captain [Yang Kenan] continued to press forward relentlessly.
0:49:7|0:49:19|Later, he picked up the iron knife in his other hand and struck the man's knee. On the other side, a man in black rushed forward with a knife towards the already injured henchman. At that moment, a bamboo basket flew over and hit the man's head directly. His accomplice turned to look.
0:49:19|0:49:30|Captain [Yang Kenan]'s wife was found standing on the opposite side. She rushed forward with a knife, but she dodged to the side and then kicked the man in the throat, forcefully pinning him to the ground. Her men were holding a jack and confronting the men in black.
0:49:30|0:49:31|Accidentally, her foot was injured.
0:49:31|0:49:41|[Yang Kenan]'s wife limped backwards, with a black-clothed person wielding a knife closing in step by step. She picked up a bamboo basket to block, but it was cut in half by a knife. However, the sharp teeth of the bamboo basket happened to become a defensive weapon.
0:49:41|0:49:46|With a forceful swing of her hands, terrifying blood marks appeared on the man's face.
0:49:46|0:49:54|At this moment, [Yang Kenan] was still entangled with the villain, his fingers swiftly spinning the short axe in his hand before rising to block the man's broadsword.
0:49:54|0:50:5|As the man struggled, [Yang Kenan] lifted his leg and kicked the opponent's knee. The villain stepped back in pain, then seized the opportunity to kick a stool straight at the man's head. [Yang Kenan] picked up a short axe and ended it all.
0:50:5|0:50:15|Later, [Yang Kenan] turned to look at another villain leader, only to see that person glaring and rushing forward with a knife. [Yang Kenan] calmly blocked it, and his henchmen immediately came to help.
0:50:15|0:50:22|At this moment, a sinister laughter echoed in the quiet backyard. [Yang Kenan] cautiously walked to the door, opened a crack, and peered into the backyard.
0:50:22|0:50:33|In the prison, [Cao Shaolin] was seen laughing while taking off his outer garment. At that moment, the brother with a machete bent down to dodge the attack from behind, but another person in front delivered a sweeping leg kick. He tried to evade it, but ended up being struck from behind.
0:50:36|0:50:39|A kick landed on the ground. Everyone gripped their weapons, looking at the two black-clothed figures in front of them.
0:50:41|0:50:50|Come on, after speaking, the two men in black ran away in opposite directions. The leader jumped up along the wooden pole in the courtyard, and the man with curly hair immediately ran forward. Unexpectedly, the black-clothed man protecting the leader turned around and swung his knife.
0:50:50|0:50:55|Soon after, [Ma Feng] quickly took advantage of the situation and climbed up a wooden pole to escape. The brothers hurriedly followed him out.
0:51:4|0:51:6|The brothers held [Guangzai], who was lying on the ground, in their arms.
0:51:6|0:51:13|[Yang Kenan] also slowly walked over, looking at the body of Guangzi with half-open eyes. He slowly squatted down, putting down the weapon in his hand.
0:51:13|0:51:26|The heartbroken [Yang Kenan] reached out to touch Guangzi's head. The people of Pucheng gathered at [Yang Kenan]'s doorstep, fear evident in their eyes. [Yang Kenan]'s wife limped out from another courtyard and, upon seeing Guangzi's body, tears welled up in her eyes.
0:51:26|0:51:34|The brother holding a single knife roared. Everyone hurried to stop the impulsive Zhang Wu, with Yang Kenan quickly following.
0:51:36|0:51:42|The one speaking looked at the scene in front of him, abruptly stopping, [Zhang Wu] looked up at [Cao Shaolin] in the prison with widened eyes.
0:51:42|0:51:53|Behind him, [Yang Kenan] frowned, only to see the white cloth already tied to the beam. [Cao Shaolin] looked at the people in front of him, then he smiled and stuck his head in, kicking away the stool beneath his feet.
0:51:53|0:52:6|At this moment, [Cao Shaolin], suspended in mid-air, kept kicking his feet, soon rolling his eyes and foaming at the mouth. [Yang Kenan] behind him was shocked, taking a few steps forward, while the curly-haired man beside him stared in astonishment.
0:52:6|0:52:15|The two henchmen stood still, unsure of what to do. At this moment, [Cao Shaolin]'s body tremors became smaller and smaller, with foam continuously spewing from his mouth, causing the curly-haired man to shout in panic.
0:52:32|0:52:39|Cao Shaolin, with foam at the corner of his mouth, finally came to his senses. He coughed hard and laughed heartily. The curly-haired man was so scared that he leaned against the wall, panting heavily.
0:52:39|0:52:46|[Cao Shaolin] spat out a mouthful of saliva and said with a smile.
0:53:2|0:53:8|Cao Shaolin, who was laughing and lying on the ground, slowly sat up and looked teasingly at Yang Kenan.
0:53:12|0:53:23|[Cao Shaolin] clapped his hands with a mouth full of foam, while the curly-haired man who had already sat on the ground, trembling, moved the clothes he used to hang himself to the side.
0:53:23|0:53:31|At this moment, [Ma Feng] arrives outside [Cao Shaolin]'s tent. Soon after, the soldier at the door enters the tent to report the situation.
0:53:35|0:53:43|[Zhang Wu] frowned and looked at the three eggs on the table. Then, he picked up one and played with it in his hand. At that moment, [Ma Feng] swaggered in from outside the tent.
0:53:43|0:53:45|As he was about to approach the long table, he stopped in his tracks.
0:53:45|0:53:53|[Zhang Wu] heard footsteps and slowly looked up. When they locked eyes, both of them showed a meaningful gaze. At that moment, [Zhang Wu] swung the egg in his hand.
0:53:53|0:54:1|Standing in place, [Ma Feng] raised his left hand and effortlessly caught it. He looked down at the egg in his hand, then looked up in confusion, only to be met with a stern glare from the other person.
0:54:1|0:54:9|At this moment, [Zhang Wu] suddenly stood up, and [Ma Feng] also walked towards him. As the two approached each other, [Zhang Wu] looked at [Ma Feng]'s face, and his eyes gradually softened.
0:54:9|0:54:13|On the other side, [Ma Feng] was unnaturally rolling his eyes and looking around.
0:54:13|0:54:19|Looking at the strange look in the other person's eyes, [Zhang Wu] raised his clenched fist, while [Ma Feng] squinted and wrinkled his face.
0:54:19|0:54:26|[Zhang Wu] was at a loss, gently pounding his chest.
0:54:27|0:54:34|After speaking, he touched his stubble and nodded, said [Zhang Wu].
0:54:44|0:54:53|[Ma Feng] picked up the wine jar and tapped it, while [Zhang Wu] chuckled lightly and said. He looked slightly surprised and continued.
0:56:6|0:56:9|[Ma Feng] is lying on the map, looking up at [Zhang Wu].
0:56:9|0:56:15|The person looked at him with a smile, placed the wine jar on the table, then pulled out a chair and sat down.
0:57:2|0:57:11|[Zhang Wu]'s words made [Ma Feng]'s eyes dim in an instant. He remained silent for a moment before turning to speak. The anger in [Zhang Wu]'s eyes showed no sign of diminishing.
0:57:11|0:57:14|Ma Feng's mind was now immersed in painful memories.
0:57:15|0:57:30|In the memory, a man was crazily wielding a knife towards [Ma Feng], while [Zhang Wu], also known as senior brother [Zhang Yi], was fighting with others holding a long spear. He used the spear as a pivot point, sweeping around and kicking away the bandits beside him one by one. [Ma Feng] kicked a bandit away and said.
0:57:56|0:58:6|Senior Brother [Zhang Yi] looked at the person on the ground and said coldly. At this moment, a box with the emblem of the escort agency fell down from behind, and a woman ran out crying and shouted.
0:58:18|0:58:22|At this moment, [Zhang Yi] forcefully shook off his hand and went to help the official.
0:58:22|0:58:29|The angry man lunged with his sword, only to be parried by [Zhang Yi]'s long spear. Seizing the opportunity, the official immediately raised his broadsword and thrust forward.
0:59:2|0:59:11|At this moment, the brothers around him all looked at him in silence. The couple killed by the corrupt official lay together on the side, and he still held the big knife in his hand, unwilling to put it down.
0:59:14|0:59:22|Unwilling [Ma Feng] was so angry that his face twitched, but when he thought that he might bring trouble to his innocent brothers in the escort agency, he had to suppress his anger and slowly put down the big knife in his hand.
0:59:22|0:59:31|Across from him, [Zhang Yi] saw him compromise and quickly put away his long spear. [Ma Feng] bowed his head in silence for a moment, then raised it and said bitterly.
0:59:31|0:59:41|He then walked to a distant hillside, and when he picked up the big knife with the dart bureau logo again, [Ma Feng]'s eyes were filled with resentment.
0:59:41|0:59:45|He slammed the knife heavily into the ground, then kicked it in half with one foot.
0:59:45|0:59:53|The short blade with a handle, grazed [Zhang Yi]'s face and plunged straight into the tree trunk, causing the two to part ways.
1:0:1|1:0:10|[Ma Feng] looked at his senior brother with a serious expression, gave a bitter smile, then picked up the egg in his hand and shook it at him, saying.
1:0:11|1:0:18|After speaking, he glared at [Zhang Yi] and turned to leave, only to hear shouting from behind. [Ma Feng] stopped in his tracks and turned around.
1:0:19|1:0:25|[Zhang Yi]’s words completely extinguished [Ma Feng]’s last hope. He didn’t respond, then turned and left the camp without looking back.
1:0:25|1:0:33|In the prison yard at night, [Cao Shaolin] is sitting inside with his eyes closed, leaning back as if half asleep, his chest rising and falling with each breath.
1:0:33|1:0:42|A familiar figure was seen swiftly leaping down from the roof. The sneaky Ma Feng looked towards Cao Shaolin inside, then leaned against the prison door and whispered.
1:0:48|1:0:50|[Cao Shaolin] cautiously watched the stranger who was picking the lock.
1:0:50|1:0:59|[Ma Feng] was seen holding a toothpick in his mouth, then taking out a small blade to insert into the lock. At this moment, [Cao Shaolin] revealed a sly smile of unknown meaning.
1:1:10|1:1:20|[Ma Feng] looked at him in this appearance and said.
1:1:24|1:1:31|[Ma Feng] leaned against the prison gate for a moment, then muttered in annoyance to himself.
1:1:33|1:1:41|He was thinking deeply when, feeling agitated, he looked up and saw Captain [Yang Kenan] standing behind him. Startled, [Ma Feng] widened his eyes as Captain [Yang Kenan] threw the key directly at him.
1:1:41|1:1:49|[Ma Feng] took the key and held it in his hand. Captain [Yang Kenan] nodded towards the door lock, indicating to open it. Puzzled, [Ma Feng] looked at him.
1:1:49|1:1:57|He then turned around and inserted the key to unlock the door. Inside, [Cao Shaolin] was sitting with one foot on the bench, smiling and shaking his head at him.
1:1:57|1:2:5|Turning towards Captain [Yang Kenan], he raised his chin. Seeing this, [Ma Feng] turned around and spoke.
1:2:6|1:2:13|After speaking, he tossed the key over. Captain [Yang Kenan] caught the key and said to [Ma Feng]. Then he walked towards the prison while speaking.
1:2:16|1:2:21|[Yang Kenan] stared at [Cao Shaolin] in the prison, getting closer step by step, with deeper meaning in his eyes.
1:2:44|1:2:50|[Yang Kenan] listened without changing his expression, while [Cao Shaolin] spoke to the back of [Ma Feng].
1:2:57|1:3:4|[Ma Feng] looked at [Cao Shaolin]'s disgusting attitude and showed a look of disgust, while [Yang Kenan] clenched his teeth in anger.
1:3:4|1:3:12|At this moment, the curly-haired man's back appeared at the entrance of Cheng Liqian Pawnshop. After the door opened, two henchmen stood on the left and right sides respectively.
1:3:12|1:3:19|A servant walked at the front, leading the way. Another large door opened, and the curly-haired man followed the servant up the stairs.
1:3:19|1:3:27|Upon entering, Bai Ling and the influential elders of Pucheng were gathered together. When the curly-haired man walked in, Bai Ling spoke up and asked.
1:3:30|1:3:34|In the dimly lit lakeside, footsteps could be heard as [Yang Kenan] looked around with a kerosene lamp in hand.
1:3:34|1:3:40|Seeing the old [Brother Liao] crouching on the bridge, he quickened his pace and walked over. The crouching old [Brother Liao] hugged his arms tightly in the cold wind.
1:3:40|1:3:43|But the inner restlessness made him unable to sit or stand still.
1:3:54|1:3:59|Watching the flustered expression of old Brother Liao, Yang Kenan was puzzled. Walking ahead, Brother Liao kept wiping the sweat off his forehead.
1:3:59|1:4:11|He then took out some food from his pocket and handed it over.
1:4:34|1:4:44|[Yang Kenan] didn't say anything, took a bite of the pastry in his hand. Then, he patted [Brother Liao] and asked.
1:4:59|1:5:4|[Yang Kenan] said to [Brother Liao] after listening. He took a bite of the biscuit and lowered his head.
1:6:38|1:6:43|Brother Liao's kneeling made Yang Kenan heartbroken.
1:6:43|1:6:53|For the future of the people of Pucheng, he still couldn't relent. Then, he stepped forward and lowered his head to say to [Brother Liao].
1:7:1|1:7:6|At this moment, [Yang Kenan]'s eyes were filled with tears as he continued to speak.
1:7:8|1:7:12|He looked up at the thick night sky, his eyes shining with determination.
1:7:12|1:7:20|He then spoke to the distance. He furrowed his brows, his gaze sharp, and then, he said helplessly.
1:7:30|1:7:36|He grabbed Brother Liao by the collar and lifted him up, saying.
1:7:42|1:7:56|Watching [Yang Kenan] with red eyes, [Brother Liao] nodded at him with tears streaming down his face. Under the suppression of evil forces and the pressure of bearing the lives of the entire city, after many years of brotherhood, he would rather sacrifice himself to protect Pucheng. At this moment, [Brother Liao] finally understood his persistence and his righteousness.
1:7:56|1:7:59|He gave Captain [Yang Kenan] a heavy pat on the shoulder and intended to leave.
1:8:1|1:8:7|Hearing the shout, Brother Liao turned his head in panic. He saw a group of people holding torches, marching aggressively towards the wooden bridge.
1:8:7|1:8:14|[Captain Yang Kenan] looked towards the other end of the bridge, unexpectedly, another group of people and horses appeared in front of him, with [Wang Weihu], the guardian of Boss Liu, leading the way.
1:8:14|1:8:21|He walked over arrogantly, with his henchmen behind him showing fierce expressions. Brother Liao took a deep breath and asked.
1:8:47|1:8:55|On both sides of the wooden bridge, the lake water made a strange sound, one bamboo plank after another rose from the lake surface continuously, extending all the way to the end of the bridge.
1:8:55|1:9:2|The sharp bamboo tips, illuminated by the torches, appeared even sharper. Rows of bamboo tips gradually emerged in the gap where the boat was stopped.
1:9:2|1:9:11|Watching the bamboo trap with no way out in front of him, Brother Liao's eyes transitioned from panic to determination. At that moment, a spear with a torch on it was suddenly thrust out by [Wang Weihu]'s henchman.
1:9:11|1:9:15|Brother Liao quickly opened his arms and shielded Captain [Yang Kenan] behind him.
1:9:16|1:9:23|Captain [Yang Kenan] was seen protecting Brother Liao with one hand, while throwing a long spear with flames on it with the other hand. The spear, with flames, clashed against the long whip, causing sparks to fly.
1:9:24|1:9:32|Faced with such a powerful opponent, the henchmen holding spears all took a few steps back. Brother Liao shouted loudly at [Yang Kenan], the team leader.
1:9:32|1:9:47|After speaking, old Brother Liao turned around to deal with the person behind him. He walked forward, picked up the kerosene lamp in his hand, knocked the spear with fire to the side, dodged the consecutive stabs of the spear by bending over, and directly kicked the person onto the bamboo board in the water. On the other side, Wang Weihu's henchman rushed over with a spear.
1:9:47|1:9:57|Captain [Yang Kenan] cracked his whip accurately, tightly entangling the upper body of the man. In the next moment, the younger brother's body soared into the air, and the next second the whole person fell straight onto the sharp bamboo tip on the side.
1:9:57|1:10:2|The three behind were dumbfounded, Captain [Yang Kenan] cracked his whip and entangled the spears of the three.
1:10:2|1:10:10|In an instant, sparks flew everywhere, and the long whip turned darker under the scorching flames. Old Brother Liao snatched the enemy's spear and fended off attacks from others on both sides.
1:10:10|1:10:14|Unexpectedly, a crescent-shaped scimitar was pressed directly against his waist at this moment.
1:10:14|1:10:22|Intense heat penetrated through the clothing and reached the skin. Old [Brother Liao] let out a painful howl. Then, the man actually lifted old [Brother Liao] up with a machete and threw him behind.
1:10:22|1:10:31|Lying on the ground, old [Brother Liao] was covered in blood, struggling to lift his head and watching Captain [Yang Kenan] fall into a trap with enemies on all sides, feeling extremely guilty in his heart.
1:10:31|1:10:38|At this moment, the henchmen holding spears said to him. After speaking, they turned and ran towards [Yang Kenan], the leader.
1:10:38|1:10:46|Sensing the danger, Captain [Yang Kenan] turned around, bent over, and cracked his whip, wrapping it around someone's ankle. Then he straightened the whip, placing his other hand on it as well.
1:10:46|1:10:48|The person was effortlessly thrown out.
1:10:48|1:11:0|Suddenly, someone rushed up from behind. [Yang Kenan] wrapped around the person's knee and pulled hard, making him kneel straight on the ground. Unexpectedly, at this moment a long spear appeared, [Yang Kenan] flew and stepped on it, walking up along the pole.
1:11:0|1:11:9|With another kick to the head of the man, seeing his henchmen almost half dead, [Wang Weihu] hiding behind finally couldn't hold back anymore. He shouted and charged forward with a crescent blade in hand.
1:11:9|1:11:18|[Yang Kenan] dodges the close-range attacks from left and right, trying to create distance for his whip. He takes a few steps back and then unleashes his skillful long whip, forcing [Wang Weihu] to retreat repeatedly.
1:11:19|1:11:25|The one-eyed henchman behind saw that the boss couldn't beat the opponent, so he immediately stepped forward to help. [Yang Kenan] gritted his teeth and blocked attack after attack.
1:11:25|1:11:31|At this moment, Brother Liao behind them stood up with a spear in hand, roaring angrily, and charged forward with the spear.
1:11:31|1:11:37|Brother Liao stabbed straight into the man blocking the way. Unexpectedly, Yang Kenan was cunningly attacked from behind by Wang Weihu.
1:11:40|1:11:45|[Yang Kenan], ignoring his wound, swung his whip backhandedly, and the long whip landed directly on the left side of [Wang Weihu]'s face, leaving a sudden blood mark.
1:11:46|1:11:50|He was then thrown to the ground by the domineering Hou Li, landing flat on his face.
1:11:50|1:11:56|Brother Liao stood in front of him, supporting his wound and standing up. [Wang Weihu] got up and looked at him fiercely.
1:11:56|1:12:4|He picked up the crescent blade, easily blocking Brother Liao's feeble attacks. Then, he split the spear in half, and forcefully thrust it into Brother Liao's chest.
1:12:4|1:12:13|Captain Yang saw this scene and shouted. Old [Brother Liao] spurted blood from his mouth, while [Wang Weihu] stared with eyes wide open, gritting his teeth and saying.
1:12:20|1:12:31|[Wang Weihu] gritted his teeth and forcefully pierced through old [Brother Liao]'s body. Old [Brother Liao] lost too much blood, looked up at the dark and lightless night sky, and finally fell straight back, landing on the wooden bridge.
1:12:32|1:12:37|On the other side, Captain Yang whipped his opponent onto the bamboo tip on the surface of the lake.
1:12:37|1:12:44|The henchmen behind saw the situation and fled with their spears. Later, Captain Yang turned around and slowly walked towards [Wang Weihu] with a long whip.
1:12:44|1:12:51|Feeling the murderous intent, [Wang Weihu] tightened the curved machete in his hand and shouted to prepare for an attack. Unexpectedly, Captain Yang flicked his whip and knocked his curved machete aside.
1:12:51|1:13:1|Later, his ankles were entwined with a long whip and pulled back. [Wang Weihu] defiantly knelt up, but Captain Yang immediately entwined his neck with the long whip.
1:13:1|1:13:9|He stepped on the back of [Wang Weihu] with one foot and pulled back forcefully with his other hand. At this moment, the face of the red-faced [Wang Weihu] reached out his hands, struggling frantically.
1:13:9|1:13:14|Captain Yang pulled back with force again, and soon the person kneeling on the ground fell silent.
1:13:14|1:13:22|After successfully avenging, Captain Yang threw away his whip, walked beside old [Brother Liao], and squatted down. Old [Brother Liao], with blood all over his mouth, struggled to lift his head and looked at Captain Yang.
1:13:22|1:13:30|He opened his mouth slightly, as if wanting to say something, but only a heavy hoarse sound came out of his throat. Captain Yang looked at the old [Brother Liao], holding back the tears in his eyes.
1:13:30|1:13:35|After a while, old Brother Liao gradually lost his breath, but his eyes still did not leave Captain Yang Kenan.
1:13:35|1:13:44|For many years, due to the loss of his comrade-in-arms, [Yang Kenan], the commander, was filled with guilt. He silently bent down and lifted the body of old [Brother Liao] onto his back.
1:13:44|1:13:55|At this moment, scattered bodies lay in front and behind the wooden bridge, and the boats by the lake, at some point, were also set ablaze by the flames of the spears. Captain [Yang Kenan] carried old [Brother Liao] and walked towards the lake shore in the firelight.
1:13:55|1:14:0|He firmly held Brother Liao's hands and legs, taking steady steps forward.
1:14:0|1:14:8|The death of old Brother Liao seemed to be the final straw that overwhelmed Captain Yang Kenan's heart, prompting him to question whether what he had done was right or wrong.
1:14:8|1:14:17|At this moment, a figure on horseback appeared on the misty shore, Captain [Yang Kenan] looked up and saw [Ma Feng] arriving slowly, standing silently in front of him.
1:14:17|1:14:23|[Ma Feng] looked at the scene in front of him with anger in his heart. But at this moment, the person he felt more sympathy for was Captain [Yang Kenan].
1:14:23|1:14:31|The lack of understanding from the people of Pucheng almost cost him his life, but his original intention was to protect all the people of Pucheng.
1:14:31|1:14:38|Late at night on the street, all the people of Pucheng hurriedly ran to the home of Captain [Yang Kenan], whispering and discussing in the courtyard.
1:14:38|1:14:42|The news of the death of Brother [Liao] quickly spread to everyone.
1:14:43|1:14:51|The people wept with worried faces, concerned about their future. Two subordinates ran out of the courtyard and persuaded the gathered people to leave.
1:14:52|1:14:57|Inside the house, [Zhang Wu] kept touching Brother Liao's face, tears already welling up in his eyes.
1:14:57|1:15:10|Next, he let out a regretful roar, while a brother beside him bowed his head and sighed in the corner, and another brother stood with his hands on his hips, looking slightly angry at the body lying in front of him. [Zhang Wu] took out a handkerchief and gently wiped the blood from Brother Liao's mouth.
1:15:10|1:15:19|At this moment, Captain [Yang Kenan], who narrowly escaped death, is tightly embracing his wife who is crying bitterly by the wall in the backyard. He is comforting her softly while patting her back.
1:15:19|1:15:31|At this moment, the tender care comforted his shattered heart, and he vowed to protect all the people in Pucheng. The one he cared most about was his own bedmate. Suddenly, someone inside the house shouted.
1:15:44|1:15:50|[Zhang Wu] and his brothers arrived outside the courtyard, only to find that the ordinary people of Pucheng were all standing outside Mr. Liu's door.
1:15:50|1:15:58|After hearing the noise, everyone turned to look at Zhang Wu and the others.
1:16:13|1:16:20|[Yang Kenan] the captain comforted [Zhang Wu] and then walked forward. Some people among the commoners, swayed by Boss Liu's slander, had already started to look at [Yang Kenan] the captain with cold eyes.
1:16:20|1:16:24|The women sobbed in fear, quietly lifting their sleeves to wipe away their tears.
1:16:24|1:16:32|At this moment, [Ma Feng] sat on the roof from a distance, observing the scene in front of him. Then, a woman spoke first.
1:17:3|1:17:11|After listening to everyone's dissuasion, Captain [Yang Kenan] looked at all the people around him. Everyone was waiting for an answer. He took a few steps forward and spoke.
1:17:25|1:17:37|After speaking, there was another round of murmurs in the crowd, with everyone expressing their inner worries to each other. Boss Liu and others stood in front of their own door, looking smugly at the pressured Captain [Yang Kenan]. His subordinates stood by silently.
1:17:37|1:17:42|One person had their mouth shut, suppressing their emotions.
1:18:13|1:18:18|Seeing the old man kneeling in front of Captain [Yang Kenan], the people behind him were praying and kneeling down one after another.
1:18:18|1:18:26|Seeing this scene, [Yang Kenan] the captain felt a mix of emotions in his heart. What he didn't expect was that his good intentions had now become a burden for the people.
1:18:26|1:18:35|[Yang Kenan]'s wife looked at the kneeling man, her eyes gradually becoming cold. [Yang Kenan], the captain, sighed softly as he stood in place. At this moment, Cao Shaolin stood inside the prison.
1:18:35|1:18:43|He looked up and laughed as the sky gradually brightened. [Ma Feng], who was sitting on the roof, saw this scene and felt uneasy.
1:18:43|1:18:47|At this moment, one of the subordinates standing next to Captain [Yang Kenan] shouted into the crowd.
1:19:3|1:19:9|The young man didn't say much more, and just knelt down straight. Captain [Yang Kenan] saw this scene and felt a little sad.
1:19:9|1:19:15|Unexpectedly, the subordinates of the security team behind them, one after another, knelt down, leaving the leader [Yang Kenan] alone with a heavy heart.
1:19:15|1:19:19|[Ma Feng] looked at [Yang Kenan]'s face, as if he had already sensed the loss in his heart.
1:19:20|1:19:26|[Yang Kenan] turned around, looking at the people kneeling in front of him, and then at the few henchmen standing beside him.
1:19:26|1:19:34|He couldn't help but reflect on his past persistence, which led to the deaths of Guangzi and Lao Liao. Now he was being forced by the people to release the killer demon.
1:19:34|1:19:40|Thinking the other way around, the people just want to live, they want their next generation to live in this ancestral homeland.
1:19:42|1:19:50|After much deliberation, [Yang Kenan] silently shook his head and then walked into the crowd, speaking.
1:20:25|1:20:30|[Yang Kenan] finished speaking and walked away. His wife watched his lonely figure, tears welling up in her eyes.
1:20:30|1:20:34|The people of Pucheng heard this and cried, bending down to the ground.
1:20:34|1:20:40|Perhaps only in this way can they alleviate the guilt they feel towards the Yang family for generations.
1:20:40|1:20:51|Seeing the people lying on the ground, [Ma Feng] also felt anxious. He could hardly imagine what Pu City would be like without [Yang Kenan]. Once the killer demon is released tomorrow,
1:20:51|1:21:0|Are these people kneeling on the ground still have a chance to survive? [Yang Kenan] walks towards the house while looking up at [Ma Feng]. At the same time, [Ma Feng] also looks at him with a hint of confusion.
1:21:0|1:21:7|As Yang Kenan's figure disappeared, he picked up the toothpick in his hand and put it in his mouth, frowning as he looked at the pitch-black sky.
1:21:14|1:21:19|[Yang Kenan] gently took down the family portrait painted by his daughter on the wall, while his wife stood behind him, silently watching.
1:21:19|1:21:24|Yang Kenan turned around to see his wife, with red eyes and a serious expression.
1:21:24|1:21:32|He then reached out his hand and handed over the neatly folded family photo, followed by embracing his wife tightly in his arms.
1:21:39|1:21:44|[Yang Kenan] paused for a moment and continued speaking.
1:21:45|1:21:51|At this moment, a round of morning sun gradually rises from the east, and [Mrs. Liu] rushes to the prison gate with everyone.
1:22:24|1:22:33|At this moment, [Yang Kenan] is playing with his daughter.
1:22:56|1:23:1|Satisfied [Yang Kenan] couldn't help but kiss his daughter's adorable face.
1:23:1|1:23:7|He then reached out and tightly embraced the little person in his arms, tears already starting to well up in his eyes.
1:23:7|1:23:11|He then reluctantly kissed the soft face.
1:23:11|1:23:20|At this moment, Bai Ling, still with her foot injury, came to the hall leaning on a long stick. Several henchmen carrying luggage followed behind her, and one of them stepped forward and spoke.
1:23:34|1:23:40|Yang Kenan's wife forced a smile in response. Everyone lowered their heads uncomfortably. Zhang Wu put down the burden and said.
1:23:51|1:24:0|After Zhang Wu finished speaking, his lips trembled uncontrollably. Yang Kenan looked at him and nodded silently. Everyone bent down to bow to the captain without prior arrangement.
1:24:2|1:24:11|Everyone stood up straight, looked at [Yang Kenan] with a serious expression, then slowly turned and walked out the door. [Yang Kenan] kept his head down, unable to look at the departing figure.
1:24:11|1:24:18|Seeing everyone walking further and further away, he looked up and glanced at his wife beside him. The wife, pretending to be strong, showed him a relieved smile.
1:24:18|1:24:22|Later, holding his daughter's hand, he walked out without looking back.
1:24:22|1:24:30|[Yang Kenan] stood still, watching the departing figures of his loved ones, feeling a sudden pain in his heart. His wife, who dared not look back, struck a deep chord in his heart.
1:24:30|1:24:33|At this moment, the daughter turned back and waved to [Yang Kenan].
1:24:33|1:24:42|He stiffly reached out his hand and weakly waved it. The figures of the mother and daughter became increasingly blurry, [Yang Kenan] turned around, put his fingers on his eyelids, and rubbed them hard.
1:24:42|1:24:50|[Yang Kenan], with his once straight back now curled up, tightly pressed his eyelids with his fingers, trying hard to control the collapse of his inner self.
1:24:50|1:24:55|After pausing for a moment in place, he dragged his heavy steps and took a few strides forward.
1:24:55|1:24:59|Afterwards, he opened his eyes and reached out to the warm table and chairs that remained.
1:25:18|1:25:25|[Yang Kenan] glanced at [Ma Feng], lowered his head and smiled helplessly, then he looked at [Ma Feng] and said.
1:25:29|1:25:36|[Ma Feng] was so surprised by [Yang Kenan]'s actions that he couldn't speak. He turned his head, pursed his lips, and then glanced at [Yang Kenan].
1:25:36|1:25:40|Without further persuasion, he turned and left the courtyard, walking towards the door.
1:25:40|1:25:48|[Yang Kenan] has been watching [Ma Feng] walking away. Perhaps, compared to the responsibilities on his shoulders, at this moment, he is also envious of [Ma Feng]'s carefree and casual attitude.
1:25:48|1:26:0|It is also because of this responsibility that he has become the guardian who lives up to the generations of the Yang family. At this moment, the bumpy carriage is crowded with children, all quietly waiting to go to another unfamiliar place.
1:26:0|1:26:5|[Ma Feng] rode at the front, with a carter standing at the intersection waving to them.
1:26:5|1:26:13|At this moment, the people of Pucheng stood on both sides of the road, and [Zhang Yi], riding a horse with several soldiers, aggressively entered the city gate.
1:26:13|1:26:23|He looked around at the people with a proud expression on his face, then headed straight for the courtyard of [Yang Kenan]. Inside the courtyard, [Yang Kenan] sat in the hall, watching the door while swinging the long whip in his hand.
1:26:23|1:26:29|The long whip spiraled in [Yang Kenan]'s hand as the soldiers lined up in the courtyard.
1:26:29|1:26:35|[Zhang Yi] dismounted and led his men into the courtyard. He glanced at [Yang Kenan] and then headed straight for the backyard.
1:26:35|1:26:40|At this moment, the long whip in [Yang Kenan]'s hand also happened to hit the ground.
1:26:41|1:26:50|A large group of soldiers with guns rushed into the backyard, causing the kneeling civilians to scatter in fear. [Zhang Yi] and another henchman behind him strode to the prison gate, where he bowed and spoke.
1:27:18|1:27:25|[Yang Kenan] walked out from the door facing the prison, and the soldiers around all turned to look. Inside the prison, [Cao Shaolin] smiled.
1:27:26|1:27:34|At this moment, the people of Pucheng looked at [Yang Kenan] with worry on their faces, but the current situation made everyone feel particularly embarrassed. [Yang Kenan] looked around.
1:27:34|1:27:40|The surrounding people dared not look directly into his eyes. He slowly walked towards the prison, turning the key in his hand.
1:27:41|1:27:48|He calmly walked up to [Zhang Yi] and then pushed away the henchman who had caused trouble at his home.
1:27:49|1:27:57|The henchman angrily shook his collar and gave a fierce glance at [Yang Kenan], while [Cao Shaolin] in the prison watched this scene with interest.
1:27:57|1:28:5|Yang Kenan walked to the door, unlocked the iron lock with a key, and stood at the doorway with a cold expression, looking at Cao Shaolin's smug face.
1:28:5|1:28:11|Next, [Cao Shaolin] stood up, smiled and walked out. He walked up to [Yang Kenan], staring provocatively into his eyes.
1:28:11|1:28:15|Then slowly turned his body around, revealing his hands handcuffed.
1:28:15|1:28:23|He turned to look at [Yang Kenan], then shook his hand. [Yang Kenan] had to pick up the keys again and personally unlock the handcuffs for him.
1:28:25|1:28:33|[Cao Shaolin] gestured with his hand and handed over a pistol to [Yang Kenan], saying.
1:28:49|1:28:52|[Yang Kenan] holds a knife and looks at the people standing around.
1:28:52|1:28:59|Everyone stared at him with anxious expressions, shaking their heads repeatedly. Mr. Liu on the side also silently shifted his gaze away, looking elsewhere.
1:28:59|1:29:4|[Yang Kenan] lowered his head in despair, sighed, and then let out a helpless laugh.
1:29:4|1:29:9|The laughter was filled with sadness and heroism, [Yang Kenan] thought for a moment, then looked up and said to [Cao Shaolin].
1:29:34|1:29:37|After speaking, [Cao Shaolin] turned his back and walked out of the courtyard.
1:29:38|1:29:43|The harsh laughter filled the entire courtyard, and [Zhang Yi] stood still with a serious expression.
1:30:6|1:30:10|Mrs. Liu, who was stabbed several times, spat out blood and fell headfirst on the dining table. Cao Shaolin took out a handkerchief,
1:30:10|1:30:16|He quietly wiped the blood off his hands. Then, he smiled and said to the others.
1:30:22|1:30:26|He quickly pulled out a gun and shot the two people who were moving chopsticks to death.
1:30:26|1:30:30|Soldiers standing at the door immediately opened fire at the remaining people in the Liu residence when they saw the young marshal walking out.
1:30:32|1:30:38|After the massacre, all the valuable items in the Liu Mansion were moved onto the carts of the Cao army. At this moment, the streets of Pucheng were filled with soldiers looting everywhere.
1:30:40|1:30:47|Helpless civilians knelt on the ground, crying and wailing. Some were taken to open spaces and immediately executed by firing squad, their screams echoing in every corner.
1:30:49|1:30:57|The slightly valuable belongings of poor families were looted clean, even the bracelets on women's wrists were forcibly taken away.
1:31:4|1:31:10|She smiled and nodded at her daughter, then continued speaking.
1:31:11|1:31:19|Seeing her daughter's obedient appearance, she couldn't help but reach out and hold her tightly in her arms, tears streaming down her face at that moment.
1:31:19|1:31:22|She herself didn't know if they would ever meet again after this parting.
1:31:22|1:31:29|[Zhang Wu] and the other senior brothers came to bid farewell at the graves of Brother Liao and Guangzai. They looked solemnly at the cold tombstone in front of them.
1:31:29|1:31:35|At this moment, the children of Shitoucheng have been sent to the school in the provincial capital. They are running towards their new teacher, crying.
1:31:36|1:31:43|[Ma Feng] stood at the door and spoke to the teacher.
1:31:45|1:31:51|He couldn't bear to look at the children and then turned and walked away.
1:32:8|1:32:14|[Ma Feng] said nothing more and got up to leave.
1:32:20|1:32:25|The boys looked at [Ma Feng] with worry on their faces, while the little girl beside them couldn't stop crying. On the other side,
1:32:25|1:32:37|The woman's subordinate, with a child, rides away on horseback. [Yang Kenan]'s wife stands in place, watching her daughter leave with a peaceful expression. Soon, her reluctance in her eyes is replaced by determination. She quickly mounts the horse,
1:32:44|1:32:55|The shouts of the brothers behind her, she immediately pulled the reins and stopped in place. Looking at the loyal brotherhood, [Yang Kenan]'s wife was filled with gratitude. Everyone willingly risked danger to come back and rescue others out of a sense of righteousness.
1:32:55|1:32:56|She also admired her greatly.
1:32:56|1:33:6|At this moment, a sound of horse hooves came from the woods opposite, and the figure of [Ma Feng] riding a horse gradually appeared in front of them. [Yang Kenan]'s wife looked at the familiar figure, feeling quite excited inside.
1:33:6|1:33:11|[Ma Feng] frowned and stopped in front of them, then looked around at the upright men nearby.
1:33:11|1:33:18|Captain Yang's wife fought back tears in her eyes, while the others looked friendly at [Ma Feng] who came to the rescue at this moment.
1:33:27|1:33:38|Captain Yang's wife looked at [Ma Feng] with a hint of admiration in her eyes. This stranger, who had only known her husband for a few months, now risked his life to return to the ancient city and save people with her.
1:33:38|1:33:49|She understood that it was the sense of inner justice that bound them together, no need for words of gratitude. They once again wielded their swords and rode on the bloody path out of the encirclement.
1:33:49|1:34:7|They knew how dangerous [Cao Shaolin] was, and understood that once they returned, there would be no turning back. But when they thought about the possibility of their husband being harmed, their elder brother who had been carefully taught for many years falling into the hands of thieves, a person filled with justice, being tortured to death by a despicable person, all of this seemed worth it.
1:34:7|1:34:14|In the backyard filled with wine barrels, several commoners in different outfits are struggling to lift the wine barrels and walk towards the inside.
1:34:14|1:34:24|Inside the room, Captain Yang, hanging upside down, had his entire upper body inserted straight into a wine barrel. He kept his eyes open, swaying his body from side to side, barely holding his breath, enduring inhuman torture.
1:34:24|1:34:31|[Cao Shaolin] saw this scene and walked over triumphantly, saying.
1:34:50|1:34:55|He then raised his hand again to give orders.
1:34:56|1:35:5|At this moment, there was chaos in Pucheng. Soldiers were still looting the belongings of the common people. [Ma Feng] rode up to the gate on horseback. The soldiers guarding the city immediately brandished their long spears as a warning.
1:35:29|1:35:34|He pretended to reach into his pocket, then said solemnly.
1:35:42|1:35:51|[Ma Feng] heard this and smiled triumphantly, then raised his hands in a gesture of surrender. At this moment, one of [Yang Kenan]'s men sneaked into the arsenal of the Cao army through the skylight.
1:35:51|1:35:59|The warehouse was filled with all kinds of rifles and a dazzling array of handguns. Another henchman squeezed through the cracks in the wooden beams and entered the gunpowder depot.
1:35:59|1:36:10|He cautiously glanced at the soldiers stationed outside the door, then stood up and picked up the explosives placed in front of him. At this moment, [Zhang Wu] arrived with another brother at the place where the Cao army was having their meal.
1:36:10|1:36:17|They secretly hid in the attic grain store, watching the situation below. The old lady downstairs who was pouring tea for the soldiers was so tired that she raised her hand to wipe the sweat.
1:36:17|1:36:25|Bai Ling happened to catch sight of the two hiding in the granary. She looked surprised. The person upstairs quickly made a quiet gesture and then pointed to the side at her.
1:36:25|1:36:32|The clever [Ma Dongmei] immediately understood, she quietly passed on the message to the person pouring water next to her, then walked back into the house.
1:36:32|1:36:43|A bag of white powder is poured into the water tank, and the old lady quickly scoops a few times with a ladle before pouring the water into a teapot. A young woman next to her is leaning against the door, keeping watch for the people inside.
1:36:43|1:37:0|The soldiers, who were blindfolded, were preparing everything in an orderly manner. They picked up the water bottle and poured it into the bowl, drinking it with satisfaction. Some even poured more into their own bowls, then drank it down contentedly. However, their bodies immediately had a strong reaction.
1:37:12|1:37:16|The soldiers, under the influence of drugs, lined up to use the toilet. At this moment, [Ma Feng] was taken to where Cao Shaolin was.
1:37:16|1:37:19|The person who suddenly led the way stopped and said.
1:37:19|1:37:27|The man quickly ran up the stairs to report, [Ma Feng] looked up and saw the body of Captain [Yang Kenan] being pulled out of the wine barrel again.
1:37:40|1:37:47|Zhang Yi, standing aside, turned his head and looked, his expression turning to one of shock.
1:37:48|1:37:57|[Ma Feng] impatiently glanced at the person pushing him from behind, then stepped on a pile of ancient artifacts bags nearby and flew to [Cao Shaolin]'s side.
1:37:57|1:38:6|He spoke while looking at Zhang Yi walking towards him. As they passed by each other, Zhang Yi looked at him and whispered.
1:38:8|1:38:14|[Ma Feng] didn't even look at him, chuckled indifferently, and then walked straight towards [Cao Shaolin].
1:38:37|1:38:45|With a bewildered look on his face, the henchman was grabbed by [Ma Feng] and pulled over. He took the opportunity to snatch the man's machete and then pushed him into the arms of [Cao Shaolin], who was firing a gun.
1:38:46|1:39:2|[Zhang Yi] immediately ran forward and pulled the young marshal up. [Ma Feng] immediately placed the rescued [Captain Yang] on the ground, while the furious [Cao Shaolin] picked up a gun and fired several shots. However, [Ma Feng] shielded his subordinates who had just been grappling with him until [Cao Shaolin] ran out of bullets.
1:39:21|1:39:31|[Cao Shaolin] smiled and glanced at [Zhang Yi], who looked angry. [Zhang Yi] picked up the long spear behind him and rushed out. [Ma Feng] raised one hand to block the person in front of him and threw him away.
1:39:31|1:39:35|Afterwards, leaping over the wine barrel, he held the big knife straight and chopped towards [Cao Shaolin].
1:39:35|1:39:42|The henchmen standing on both sides immediately stepped forward to protect, but were quickly taken care of in just a few moves. [Zhang Yi] realized it and rushed to stab [Ma Feng] in the back.
1:39:42|1:39:50|[Ma Feng] turned around to block with a big knife, then turned back, lifted his leg and pressed it on the long handle. Immediately after, he rushed towards [Cao Shaolin] in front of him and stabbed.
1:39:50|1:39:59|Who would have expected that [Cao Shaolin] would pull his henchmen over and stand in front. Outraged, [Ma Feng] kicked the dead body in front of him, along with [Cao Shaolin], into the courtyard filled with nine piles.
1:39:59|1:40:5|[Zhang Yi] picked up a long spear and engaged in battle with [Ma Feng] again, swiftly spinning his weapon in hand.
1:40:5|1:40:14|Following that, with extremely fast attacking speed, he repeatedly stabbed towards Ma Feng's chest. Ma Feng, who was slower in speed, barely managed to block a few moves with his knife, then quickly moved his body backwards.
1:40:14|1:40:25|[Zhang Yi] mercilessly pressed forward, chopping the wine barrels along with the stacked firewood into halves one by one. At this moment, the common people in the teahouse held clubs, hiding in the attic, quietly waiting for the commotion outside.
1:40:25|1:40:33|In the gunpowder depot, a flame is rapidly approaching the explosives package at the end of the fuse.
1:40:37|1:40:49|Soldiers patrolling the city saw the black smoke rising above the military camp and immediately went to investigate. At this moment, the main camp of the Cao army was already engulfed in artillery fire, with [Yang Kenan]'s subordinates vigorously throwing explosive packets inside.
1:40:49|1:40:54|The soldier standing guard outside the door didn't have time to dodge and was instantly blasted aside by the powerful explosion force.
1:40:56|1:41:4|The soldier who had just finished relieving himself looked bewildered at the chaos in front of him. Unexpectedly, a bomb fell from the sky, and in an instant, the thatched cottage behind him was leveled to the ground.
1:41:4|1:41:10|Lying on the ground, [Cao Shaolin] heard the sound of an explosion and looked up in terror. Firelight was flashing on Pucheng Street.
1:41:10|1:41:22|The sound of explosions rang out repeatedly, and the soldiers standing on both sides were blown into the air, flying back and forth in the sky. At this moment, when the time was ripe, [Zhang Wu] kicked open the door and led the civilians with weapons in hand rushing in.
1:41:22|1:41:31|He angrily picked up the short knife in his hand and took care of the soldier who had turned his head. Looking around, the young and old in Pucheng were either holding kitchen knives or long sticks.
1:41:31|1:41:34|Everyone ignored the danger and got entangled with the soldiers on the street.
1:41:34|1:41:40|The civilians chased after a person in groups of three or five, the soldier without a gun could only hold his head and run away in a panic.
1:41:40|1:41:44|In the crowd, [Zhang Wu] spotted the troublemaker who had caused a scene at the hospital before.
1:41:44|1:41:52|At this moment, the villain was wielding a big knife and attacking wildly. [Zhang Wu] took out a short knife, jumped up to confront him, but still found it difficult to get close.
1:41:52|1:41:56|At this moment, the people behind all pressed down on the villain together, forcing him to the ground.
1:41:57|1:42:9|Peasants working at the distillery worked together to lift Captain [Yang Kenan], who was lying on the side, onto a ladder. Just as the four young men standing outside were about to carry him out, they saw [Cao Shaolin]'s men rushing in with knives.
1:42:9|1:42:20|The moment they put down the ladder and ran back, the unconscious Captain [Yang Kenan] fell straight down the stairs. In unbearable pain, Captain [Yang Kenan] opened his eyes only to see someone wielding a shiny big knife charging towards him.
1:42:20|1:42:26|He grabbed the handle of the knife in the man's hand, flipped him to the ground, and cut his throat in one swift motion. Unexpectedly, someone else rushed over from behind.
1:42:26|1:42:33|He turned around, lifted his leg, hid the broadsword between his legs, and stabbed straight into the man's abdomen, cutting the hemp rope on his foot at the same time.
1:42:33|1:42:46|At this moment, [Cao Shaolin] ran in from the backyard. When he saw the chaos on the street, his expression became anxious. He cautiously bent down to check on Captain [Yang Kenan] lying on the ground. The Captain, pretending to be unconscious, immediately opened his eyes.
1:42:46|1:42:58|Swing the big knife. [Cao Shaolin] immediately stepped back to dodge. At this moment, in the backyard filled with wine barrels, [Ma Feng] was still in a stalemate with [Zhang Yi], as [Ma Feng] with dual knives tried hard to dodge the fast gunshots right in front of him. On the other side, [Zhang Yi] did not give any chance to relax.
1:42:58|1:43:9|He quickly spun the long spear and thrust it towards [Ma Feng]'s chest along the crisscrossing gaps. [Ma Feng] took a few steps back and threw the wine barrel under his feet. After [Zhang Yi] broke the long spear, he also took a few steps back.
1:43:20|1:43:27|After speaking, [Zhang Yi] once again, filled with anger, fiercely struck down towards [Ma Feng]. The sharp breaking wind made [Ma Feng] repeatedly retreat.
1:43:27|1:43:36|In order to avoid the terrifying consecutive attacks, [Ma Feng] turned around and took three steps back, preparing to climb up to the highest end of the wine barrel stack, with [Zhang Yi] closely following behind.
1:43:36|1:43:46|Ma Feng's feet stepped on a wine barrel, and the long spear behind him shattered the corresponding wine barrel. He secretly rejoiced in his heart that his speed was fast enough to withstand Zhang Yi's amazing strength on the wine barrel.
1:43:46|1:43:53|At this moment, [Ma Feng] suddenly stopped and said.
1:43:58|1:44:10|Watching [Ma Feng] acting nonchalantly, [Zhang Yi] felt the anger rising in his heart once again. The two stood on top of the wine barrel, engaging in battle once more. [Ma Feng] put away his usual unruly smile, and the speed of his sword swings gradually increased.
1:45:33|1:45:48|Ma Feng's foot was stuck in the gap between the wine barrels and couldn't be pulled out. Zhang Yi, who had walked away, turned back and saw this scene. He immediately dropped the long spear in his hand, ran forward, hugged Ma Feng's waist, pulled hard, and then threw him to a safe place. However, Zhang Yi couldn't escape and was hit directly in the face by the falling wine barrel.
1:45:48|1:45:59|Only hearing the wail of [Zhang Yi], gradually drowned out by the roaring sound of falling, followed by his entire person disappearing into the thousands of rolling wine barrels.
1:46:0|1:46:5|The sound of the wine barrel rolling gradually faded, [Ma Feng] could only lie on the ground, helplessly looking at the mess.
1:46:5|1:46:22|At this moment, [Yang Kenan]'s wife rode into Pucheng on a horse, holding a cane in her hand, she knocked down the soldiers who were bullying the people one by one. Then, she headed straight for [Mrs. Liu]'s courtyard. At that moment, [Cao Shaolin] rushed out in a panic from inside, ready to chase after her with a cane, but unexpectedly, [Yang Kenan] also came out from inside.
1:46:22|1:46:34|[Yang Kenan], ignoring his wife's dissuasion, went up the stairs in the direction where [Cao Shaolin] had escaped. At this moment, in the attic, [Cao Shaolin] opened a drawer filled with bullets and hurriedly loaded his gun.
1:46:34|1:46:39|He kept an eye on the direction of the door while speeding up his movements. At this moment, [Yang Kenan] burst in.
1:46:39|1:46:47|Ignoring the handgun picked up by [Cao Shaolin], he rushed towards him, while his wife, seeing this, picked up a cane and hooked his shoulder, pulling him back.
1:46:47|1:46:49|Unexpectedly, his own arm was hit by a bullet and injured.
1:46:49|1:47:0|Seeing [Cao Shaolin] approaching them, he reached out and lifted the round table in front of him, pushing it towards [Cao Shaolin], and finally, he broke through the round table and swung the knife. [Cao Shaolin] kicked [Yang Kenan] away.
1:47:0|1:47:6|Then he crouched down and loaded the bullets. Next, he pulled out the pistol again and aimed at [Yang Kenan], who was currently dodging.
1:47:6|1:47:15|[Zhang Wu], who was fighting with the soldiers, heard the gunshots coming from the attic. He immediately stepped on the stone lion at the door, broke in through the window, and saw the disheveled Captain [Yang Kenan] on the ground. He shouted out.
1:47:16|1:47:22|[Cao Shaolin] immediately fired in the direction of [Zhang Wu], who dodged while throwing out the short knife from his waist.
1:47:22|1:47:31|[Cao Shaolin] dodged smoothly by tilting his head. At this moment, two henchmen from their own gang broke in through the window again, wielding big knives to attack. With only a short knife in hand, [Zhang Wu] managed to barely defend himself.
1:47:31|1:47:35|Soon after, the three of them started fighting in between Captain [Cao Shaolin] and Captain [Yang Kenan].
1:47:36|1:47:42|The henchman blocking Captain [Yang Kenan] was shot dead by [Cao Shaolin]. Meanwhile, [Zhang Wu] easily took down another person.
1:47:42|1:47:50|Unexpectedly, [Cao Shaolin] fired again. [Zhang Wu], who was shot, fell down in pain, and [Cao Shaolin] let out a triumphant laugh once more.
1:47:50|1:47:59|Captain [Yang Kenan] slowly stood up and walked towards [Cao Shaolin]. [Cao Shaolin] held a gun and silently aimed it in his direction.
1:47:59|1:48:4|He then burst into another wild laughter.
1:48:4|1:48:13|Captain [Yang Kenan] finally stood still, smiling and looking at him without moving.
1:48:13|1:48:23|In the sinister laughter of [Cao Shaolin], Captain [Yang Kenan] slowly closed his eyes. Bullets flew towards Captain [Yang Kenan], and at that moment, he suddenly picked up a big knife and held it in front of him. Knocked down by the impact, Captain [Yang Kenan] sat on the ground.
1:48:23|1:48:34|On the side, his wife's eyes filled with tears. He slowly picked up the large knife in his hand, and on the blade, a bullet was embedded. [Cao Shaolin] smiled widely, preparing to shoot again, but [Yang Kenan] grabbed a knife.
1:48:34|1:48:43|A shot rang out from his own head, and a bullet sprayed out, hitting [Cao Shaolin] right in the forehead. [Cao Shaolin] hadn't reacted yet, but [Yang Kenan] was already wielding a big knife and charging towards him.
1:48:43|1:48:50|He dodged a knife by bending his body, but unexpectedly [Yang Kenan] immediately performed a backward somersault, lifted his leg and kicked him onto the French window.
1:48:50|1:48:55|Furious Cao Shaolin was about to shoot again, when Yang Kenan rushed over, kicked him and threw him off the building.
1:48:57|1:49:4|[Ma Feng] was seen falling straight down from the eaves, landing next to the stone lion at the door. [Ma Feng] lying on the ground, his mouth full of blood.
1:49:4|1:49:13|After a while, he suddenly smiled, then slowly got up from the ground. He struggled to stand up, turned around to look upstairs, and a terrifying bloodstain was left on his forehead from the bullet hole.
1:49:13|1:49:20|At this moment, exhausted [Yang Kenan] was leaning on the railing, staring at him. Then, [Cao Shaolin] smiled and said.
1:49:28|1:49:36|At this moment, the townspeople on the street holding weapons were slowly approaching. [Cao Shaolin], who sensed the threat, put away his smile and looked around.
1:49:36|1:49:41|Seeing these powerless people, his face was filled with confusion.
1:49:41|1:49:49|He then picked up the pistol and pressed the trigger. Unexpectedly, the magazine made a hollow sound. He took a few steps back slowly, then warned the people around him.
1:49:54|1:50:3|Before he could finish his sentence, he was struck hard from behind. [Cao Shaolin] turned around and saw an old man with white hair holding a hoe. The old man threw the gun over and said.
1:50:5|1:50:14|Unexpectedly, at this moment, [Cao Shaolin] was hit hard from behind. He turned around to see a sickle stuck in his back. Then, a middle-aged man walked up.
1:50:14|1:50:25|Stabbing him directly in the abdomen with a knife, then smiling as he stepped back. At this moment, all the people in the ancient city roared and ran towards [Cao Shaolin].
1:50:25|1:50:35|Everyone picked up their only weapons and vented their anger towards [Cao Shaolin]. Like a dog that had lost its home, [Cao Shaolin] was punched and kicked by people, gradually being engulfed in the crowd.
1:50:35|1:50:38|Captain [Yang Kenan], who saw this scene on the rooftop, finally felt relieved.
1:50:38|1:50:42|The exhausted body involuntarily fell backwards.
1:50:42|1:50:52|At this moment, in the backyard littered with broken wine barrels, [Ma Feng] is searching for [Zhang Yi]'s figure. As he moves aside a thick half of a broken barrel, [Zhang Yi]'s pale face emerges from the rubble.
1:51:21|1:51:30|In memory, [Zhang Yi] peeled an egg, smiled, then sighed deeply and said to [Ma Feng].
1:51:36|1:51:40|In his memory, the charming smile of [Zhang Yi] always appeared in [Ma Feng]'s mind.
1:51:41|1:51:47|But now, a living person lay in front of him, unconscious. Tears fell from [Ma Feng]'s eyes.
1:51:47|1:51:54|Years of friendship within the sect have now turned into this situation, and he himself doesn't know whether what he's doing is right or wrong.
1:51:54|1:51:59|However, it can be seen that in the future, they eventually went in different directions.
1:51:59|1:52:3|After a while, [Ma Feng] dragged his heavy footsteps onto the street.
1:52:3|1:52:11|At this moment, [Yang Kenan] was sitting on the steps holding his wife who had been shot. As he approached, he saw [Cao Shaolin] lying on the ground, covered in blood, already lifeless.
1:52:12|1:52:20|He slowly bent down, sat beside [Yang Kenan], and looked up to see the people around, still glaring angrily at the body of [Cao Shaolin] as if they hadn't vented their anger yet.
1:52:20|1:52:28|Some soldiers with red eyes wanted to go see the young marshal, but they were firmly suppressed by the people behind them. [Yang Kenan] turned around and said.
1:52:29|1:52:38|[Ma Feng] looked at [Yang Kenan] and said. He then turned to the people standing around and continued speaking.
1:52:40|1:52:46|Upon hearing this, the wife in his arms looked up at [Yang Kenan], who was now radiating the light of justice.
1:52:46|1:52:50|Yang Kenan sat there with a bruised face, looking at the body of Cao Shaolin on the ground.
1:52:50|1:52:57|At this point, still muttering that my father is Cao Ying's killer, he was actually a poor child who was indoctrinated with evil ideas from a young age.
1:52:57|1:53:0|The pitiful always have something despicable about them.
1:53:0|1:53:9|Thinking about the teacher and children who died unjustly in Shitoucheng, and those innocent people who were slaughtered in Pucheng, perhaps only his death can provide solace to those persecuted souls.
1:53:9|1:53:16|In the scene, a group of soldiers in military uniforms enter Pucheng.
1:53:26|1:53:33|On the distant mountain top, the family of [Yang Kenan] looked at the cheers of victory coming from Pucheng, while [Ma Feng] standing beside them lowered his head and said.
1:54:16|1:54:23|After a brief farewell, [Ma Feng] turned and walked towards Taiping. He watched as [Ma Feng] walked further and further away.
