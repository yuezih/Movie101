0:1:26|0:1:37|She pressed the record button and said. After hanging up the phone, [Xiao Xia] stepped out of the door.
0:1:39|0:1:55|At this moment, a plane from Cyprus to Beijing Airport was slowly landing. The departure hall was bustling with people, and among them was [Lao Cui], wearing a down jacket and carrying a large suitcase. Just as the plane landed, his phone rang, and [Lao Cui] quickly took out his phone to answer the call.
0:2:18|0:2:24|Lao Cui, who returned to his homeland to make a fortune, had to buy a ticket back home at the airport before he could leave.
0:2:40|0:2:44|The beautiful flight attendant can only conceal her surprise with a sweet smile.
0:2:44|0:2:48|Lao Cui swiftly stamped the boarding pass and stamped the title of the film on it.
0:2:48|0:2:52|Lao Cui, who returned to the country, unexpectedly made his first stop at the Civil Affairs Bureau.
0:2:52|0:3:0|The staff held the divorce certificate expressionlessly, took a deep breath before stamping it forcefully, and stamped it hard on top. [Lao Cui] and his wife sat quietly.
0:3:0|0:3:8|With the fresh divorce certificate settled, Lao Cui's pregnant ex-wife turned around at the door and returned the pendant to him.
0:3:10|0:3:23|[Lao Cui] looked up, only to see his wife getting into another man's car. He glanced at the rearview mirror and saw that it was his childhood friend. With wide eyes, [Lao Cui] said incredulously. After speaking, his wife got into the car.
0:3:25|0:3:40|[Lao Cui] looked at the pixiu pendant in his hand, feeling sad in his heart. Coming all the way back from a foreign country, he couldn't bring honor to his ancestors, and even his once warm family had fallen apart. The big man stood in the empty alley, on the verge of tears.
0:4:11|0:4:16|The beer in his belly also swept away the unhappiness for [Lao Cui].
0:4:57|0:5:4|In the nightclub, Lao Cui and Xiao Xia were dancing among a group of girls, the dazzling lights enhancing the passionate atmosphere.
0:5:4|0:5:12|After the end, [Lao Cui] walked alone with a box on the bustling streets of Beijing in winter, where the lights were bright and the traffic was constant.
0:5:12|0:5:21|The drunken [Lao Cui] staggered along the road, looking even more lonely and desolate. He glanced back reluctantly at the journey, perhaps reminiscing about his past.
0:5:21|0:5:29|After walking for who knows how long, Lao Cui's alcohol scent also dissipated. He raised his hand to hail a taxi. Inside the taxi, he looked gloomily at the neon lights outside the window.
0:5:29|0:5:38|The streetlight reflected on his slightly weathered face, and suddenly a girl rushed out onto the road, it was [Xiao Xia].
0:5:46|0:5:57|[Xiao Xia] in the car looked back nervously, and when she saw that the two men didn't chase after them, she breathed a sigh of relief and put down the knife.
0:6:21|0:6:27|Upon hearing this, [Xiao Xia] placed her hand on [Lao Cui]'s shoulder, leaned in close, and asked with a mouth full of alcohol.
0:6:52|0:6:59|[Lao Cui] threw the knife out while [Xiao Xia] was asleep, glanced guiltily at [Xiao Xia], and gently rolled up the car window.
0:6:59|0:7:7|Drunk [Xiao Xia] leaned on [Lao Cui]'s shoulder in a daze, naturally wrapping her arms around [Lao Cui], leaving [Lao Cui] to pay the price for his kindness.
0:7:9|0:7:24|The car slowly stopped at the entrance of the residential area, Xiao Xia felt nauseous and vomited on Lao Cui's chest.
0:8:8|0:8:14|Unlucky [Lao Cui] was left behind, supporting [Xiao Xia] like this.
0:8:14|0:8:22|Turning around, [Xiao Xia] pretended to vomit, and [Lao Cui] quickly stepped forward to pat her back. [Xiao Xia] sat on the ground with a thud.
0:8:40|0:8:46|Seeing the other party unmoved, [Lao Cui] also became troubled. He helplessly raised his hand to look at his watch, then glanced at [Xiao Xia] on the ground.
0:8:46|0:8:53|Hesitating for a moment, Lao Cui picked up the box and turned to leave. But just as he took two steps, Xiao Xia's phone suddenly rang.
0:8:59|0:9:9|Hearing the sound, [Lao Cui] turned around, pondered for a moment, and then reached into the pocket at his feet to search for his phone. Without much thought, he answered the call.
0:9:57|0:10:5|Lao Cui, who took the key, struggled to open the door for a while, but it was opened from the inside by someone. Inside the room, four fierce men were playing mahjong.
0:10:5|0:10:14|[Lao Cui] dared not speak, [Xiao Xia] pointed to another household, and the person there immediately closed the door.
0:10:14|0:10:21|Finally, he sent Xiao Xia home.
0:10:22|0:10:31|[Lao Cui] placed [Xiao Xia] on the sofa, making sure she was lying comfortably before realizing the vomit on his clothes. Frowning, he looked down at it, then glanced at the time.
0:10:31|0:10:37|Might as well start washing clothes here. In the bathroom, [Lao Cui] is wearing a tank top, facing the mirror and scrubbing the clothes.
0:10:37|0:10:45|Lost in his thoughts while bathing, he looked up and saw [Xiao Xia] passing by in the mirror. Perhaps still in a daze, [Xiao Xia] had forgotten about the presence of this outsider in the house.
0:10:45|0:10:58|[Lao Cui] saw [Xiao Xia] heading to the bathroom, so he quickly retreated outside and turned off the light. Shortly after, he saw [Xiao Xia] coming out of the bathroom. [Lao Cui] then returned to the bathroom with his clothes, checked the time, and continued to scrub the clothes with full concentration.
0:11:1|0:11:15|Xiao Xia noticed the problem and approached the mirror, staring at the unfamiliar fat man in confusion. She yanked open the door and pulled Lao Cui out of the bathroom. Before Lao Cui could react, she kicked him.
0:11:15|0:11:18|Lao Cui, with a bewildered look on his face, sadly stared at the door.
0:11:18|0:11:28|Winter in Beijing is not easy, especially with only a vest on. It was already 11:54 according to his watch, so he went up and knocked on the door.
0:12:7|0:12:9|[Lao Cui] was quite scared.
0:12:9|0:12:21|The fierce neighbor in a coat looked [Lao Cui] up and down, sneered disdainfully at his miserable appearance, and then went back into the house.
0:12:22|0:12:27|The neighbor rushed out again, pointing at the sound-controlled light, said [Lao Cui].
0:12:28|0:12:47|The neighbor cast a disdainful glance, [Lao Cui] simply went back to the room to continue playing cards. Seeing the door closed, [Lao Cui] then stealthily approached [Xiao Xia]'s door. Just as he was about to knock, he seemed to remember the fierce neighbor, so he sneakily glanced in that direction. He hugged his arms and leaned into the door, softly calling out.
0:12:55|0:13:8|The phone suddenly rang, and [Lao Cui] hurriedly searched his pockets, thinking it was his own phone, only to find [Xiao Xia]'s phone, and saw that it was the number that had just been broadcast.
0:13:9|0:13:24|In the corridor, Guangguang and Xiao Wu walked quickly. Lao Cui stepped forward and headed straight for Xiao Xia's door.
0:13:41|0:13:49|[Guangguang] stared fiercely at the neighbor, who looked a bit intimidated by the burly [Guangguang]. Lao Wu kept pounding on the door.
0:13:55|0:14:13|The neighbor went back into the house and brought out a beer bottle. Lao Wu snatched the bottle and smashed it on the neighbor's head. [Guangguang] pushed Lao Wu, causing the neighbor's forehead to bleed profusely. The card players instantly rushed out of the house.
0:14:17|0:14:25|[Lao Cui] hides behind the door frame as two groups of people fight. [Guangguang] watches, unable to take advantage.
0:14:29|0:14:35|Taking care of Lao Wu, who ran downstairs, several neighbors followed suit, and [Lao Cui] stepped forward to continue knocking on the door.
0:14:49|0:14:56|Suddenly, Lao Cui felt that something was not right with the atmosphere. When he turned around, he found that the four neighbors who had returned at some point had surrounded him.
0:15:0|0:15:8|This straight punch sent several people to the police station, the comical [Lao Cui] wearing a police uniform jacket, with a piece of paper stuffed in his nose, apparently bleeding a lot.
0:16:39|0:16:45|Childhood friend led [Lao Cui] out of the police station, and the phone rang.
0:17:31|0:17:44|The crew van of the Jing Ke's Secret Room drove away like that, while [Lao Cui] picked out a long official robe and walked on the road, naturally attracting the attention and whispers of passersby. People passing by all tried to stay away, afraid of getting involved with this lunatic.
0:17:44|0:17:46|[Lao Cui] ran all the way to [Xiao Xia]'s house.
0:17:47|0:17:51|On the stairs, he tiptoed carefully, afraid of provoking the tough guys from yesterday again.
0:17:51|0:17:59|Peeking around with his head for a while, seeing no one else, he then climbed the stairs and went upstairs. [Lao Cui] first went to the neighbor's house, leaned against the door and listened.
0:18:1|0:18:8|Faint opera music could be heard from inside, making [Lao Cui] instantly nervous as he cautiously walked towards [Xiao Xia]'s door.
0:18:22|0:18:31|At this moment, a phone in his pocket rang, and [Lao Cui] felt it was not his own phone. It turned out that he had accidentally taken [Xiao Xia]'s phone last night.
0:19:49|0:19:57|[Lao Cui] hung up the phone and went downstairs. In the corner, brothers Guangguang and Lao Wu were tailing him, silently following [Lao Cui].
0:19:58|0:20:4|In the bustling pedestrian overpass in the city, [Lao Cui] in official attire stands out, attracting extra attention from the crowd.
0:20:4|0:20:9|He, Lao Cui, just wanted to get his things back as soon as possible and end this nightmare.
0:20:9|0:20:24|The pedestrian bridge was bustling with people, but [Xiao Xia] was nowhere to be seen. Instead, two patrolling police officers approached from the front, causing [Lao Cui] to quickly turn his back, even the officers couldn't help but tease him.
0:20:24|0:20:28|Just then, the phone in [Lao Cui]'s pocket rang.
0:20:46|0:20:58|Lao Cui in a long robe and gown was jumping in place, looking terrified, which amused the passersby. He was jumping with all his might.
0:21:2|0:21:16|At this moment, a trendy girl with curly hair and wearing leather boots walked onto the overpass, it was [Xiao Xia]. She stopped her steps about ten meters away, while [Lao Cui] eagerly ran up to her.
0:21:47|0:21:59|After saying that, he ran away, and [Lao Cui] hurried to chase after him. In the bustling crowd on the overpass, [Xiao Xia] ran ahead, followed closely by [Lao Cui] in a long robe, with Guangguang and Lao Wu bringing up the rear.
0:21:59|0:22:6|The chase quickly moved from the overpass to the mall, and [Xiao Xia] was not blind, running wildly on the crowded elevator.
0:22:7|0:22:15|[Lao Cui]'s bulky figure may not be as agile as hers, but his stamina is good, keeping up closely. Guangguang and Da Bao are afraid of losing track, so they dare not slack off.
0:22:15|0:22:24|Several people's strange behaviors attracted a lot of attention. [Xiao Xia] ran into the first floor of the mall, saw the sign for the restroom, and headed straight for the women's restroom.
0:22:27|0:22:41|The young girl inside the cubicle just walked out and saw [Lao Cui], who was dressed strangely, couldn't help but scream. Just as she turned around, she saw [Guangguang] and [Juan Mao], and the group of them climbed out of the window of the women's restroom.
0:22:46|0:22:54|Lao Cui carefully climbed over the low wall with a few steel bars sticking out, and without hesitation, Xiao Xia followed suit.
0:22:54|0:22:59|The problem lies in the wide robe and big gown, which got caught by the steel bars behind the butt.
0:23:0|0:23:6|[Lao Cui] was hung on the wall, and when he lowered his head, he found a woman burning paper next to him.
0:23:6|0:23:15|The old lady mistook [Lao Cui] for a demon in ancient costume and ran away in fear.
0:23:15|0:23:23|In a fit of anger, [Lao Cui] struggled to take off his coat and jumped directly from the wall, bumping into the couple in the alley, including [Xiao Xia].
0:23:33|0:23:37|Poor Lao Cui, wearing a tank top and holding up his pants, was mistaken for a pervert.
0:23:37|0:23:46|Xiao Xia ran to the old iron gate and squeezed through the chains. Lao Cui struggled for a while, but due to his bulky figure, he had to climb over the gate.
0:23:46|0:23:53|Then, the round Guangguang rushed over, panting heavily. Xiao Xia had just taken a few steps when Lao Wu stopped her.
0:24:2|0:24:7|Guangguang looked pleased with himself. Lao Cui at the door could only watch anxiously, while Qun Tou, who took a detour to arrive, approached Xiao Xia menacingly.
0:24:7|0:24:13|[Xiao Xia] just turned around and was about to run.
0:24:44|0:24:48|Lao Cui, hanging on the door, watches as Xiao Xia is taken away by two people.
0:27:16|0:27:25|Guangguang turned around and forcefully threw the key out of the window.
0:28:2|0:28:14|In the office, Tang Jinshan suddenly stood up as he looked at the photos of several people, then turned around and asked his subordinates.
0:28:25|0:28:30|Tang Jinshan leaned back in the boss chair, pondering, and then slowly sat up.
0:29:4|0:29:15|[Lao Cui] pushed and found that the top of the iron ladder was broken. The two changed their plan and climbed up the ladder. They freed themselves by passing the handcuffs through the break.
0:29:16|0:29:23|The two of them climbed to the highest point, both struggling to lift their arms.
0:29:32|0:29:37|[Lao Cui] picked up the phone and the two of them shook the creaky wooden door.
0:30:13|0:30:31|[Xiao Xia] shook the handcuffs in her hand, sizing up [Lao Cui], with a mischievous idea in mind. [Lao Cui] couldn't help but feel nervous, the poor [Lao Cui] only had a vest left, unable to resist [Xiao Xia]'s sharp gaze.
0:30:33|0:30:39|Speaking, [Lao Cui] untied the belt around his waist, leaving only his long johns inside.
0:31:3|0:31:7|After some hesitation, [Xiao Xia] also started to whistle.
0:31:16|0:31:22|The two people who were originally close suddenly emitted this smell, causing [Xiao Xia] to cover her mouth and nose.
0:31:22|0:31:35|Fortunately, they found the steel bars. The two twisted the fence with their pants, and the hollow fence quickly bent over. After going through some hardships, the two finally made it out. [Xiao Xia] picked up the handcuff key.
0:31:37|0:31:43|Rushing home, [Xiao Xia] ran to the staircase and noticed that the door was open.
0:31:43|0:31:50|So she slowed down, glanced sideways at the situation inside the house, made sure there was no one around, and then ran up. [Lao Cui] followed behind, holding his arm.
0:31:52|0:32:0|In the cold winter of the north, Lao Cui and Xiao Xia entered the house one after the other, only to be shocked by the scene in front of them - the room was in a mess.
0:32:0|0:32:10|[Xiao Xia] ran quickly, as if looking for something. [Lao Cui] rushed towards his luggage, but the things in his pockets were missing.
0:32:10|0:32:18|[Lao Cui] panicked, while [Xiao Xia] found a wristband from a bathhouse in the bag. On the other side,
0:32:28|0:32:36|Even though the room was messy, [Xiao Xia] seemed not to care at all. She walked into the living room with a stuffed toy in her hand.
0:32:53|0:33:0|[Lao Cui], who was putting on his pants, suddenly felt a tightness in his heart and squatted down again.
0:34:24|0:34:34|The two sat down at the table, and [Xiao Xia] lowered her head and said affectionately.
0:35:16|0:35:24|The two brothers at the repair shop were ready for anything. Just as they said that, Guangguang, who had just thrown away his lunchbox, looked up and saw a group of people led by Tang Jinshan outside the window.
0:35:24|0:35:29|About six or seven of them, led by Lao Cui, Xiao Xia, Qun Tou, Da Bao, Guangguang, Juan Mao, Ex-wife, and Bathing Man, sneaked in with steel bars and hammers in hand.
0:35:29|0:35:34|Guangguang immediately hid behind a few large tires, stretching his neck to secretly observe.
0:35:34|0:35:41|Seeing several people approaching the repair shop, [Guangguang] quickly ran towards the back while looking around, and slipped out from the back door.
0:35:43|0:35:57|Unaware, Lao Wu was still squatting in the toilet, calling out for Guangguang. A figure quietly approached the door of the toilet, then a hand wrapped in bandages pulled back the curtain, revealing Tang Jinshan to Guangge and Lao Wu.
0:35:58|0:36:13|Tang Jinshan brought a water gun, and [Lao Wu] was lifted up and sprayed wet with a high-pressure water gun. Tang Jinshan used an electric fan to blow on him.
0:36:13|0:36:21|On the other side, Xiao Xia has already brought Lao Cui to the vicinity of the bathhouse. The two are hiding behind a car in the parking lot, with Xiao Xia cautioning Lao Cui.
0:36:30|0:36:37|Nervous Lao Cui enters the room holding his hand of cards and greets the door camp, asking about the hand bracelet whenever he meets someone.
0:36:40|0:36:46|For the first time at the bathhouse, [Lao Cui] was completely clueless about the process. With the help of the attendant, he was led to a seat on the sofa in the lobby.
0:36:47|0:36:55|He nervously changed into his slippers, but noticed the sign for the garden area.
0:37:3|0:37:10|The waiter talking on the phone covered the first letter of the sign for the non-member area, and [Lao Cui], who walked in directly, made a mistake with his first step.
0:37:10|0:37:19|In the non-member area, people come and go, mostly customers with bare arms and towels draped over them. Someone like [Lao Cui], dressed in a cotton jacket and scarf, stands out.
0:37:19|0:37:36|Before long, [Lao Cui] followed the directions on the sign and found locker 263. He walked in and examined the locker, pressing the bracelet hard against the lock on the door, but there was no response at all. The non-member area and the member area were naturally not the same place, so it was only natural that the lock wouldn't open.
0:37:36|0:37:45|Unaware, [Lao Cui] tried the lock and then the latch, but to no avail. He looked back at the cabinet door, confirming it was indeed 263.
0:37:45|0:37:51|So, once again, with force, the hand circled around the middle-aged man who had just finished bathing, looking up and down at [Lao Cui].
0:37:51|0:37:59|Lao Cui, who had been trying his best, had to restrain himself and pretended to imitate the other person naturally.
0:38:1|0:38:7|With a gentle push from the other side, the door opened, and [Lao Cui] muttered to himself as if explaining to others.
0:38:7|0:38:14|The uncle showed no interest in him at all and walked past him. [Lao Cui] watched him leave, then turned around and pressed his wristband forcefully.
0:38:14|0:38:24|The waiter walked over, and [Lao Cui] quickly stopped.
0:38:27|0:38:34|Fortunately, [Lao Cui] was not discovered. At the door, [Xiao Xia] was approached by someone. [Xiao Xia] turned around to see the person looking shifty.
0:38:56|0:39:4|Facing the wardrobe, [Lao Cui] punched and kicked the door opposite, exerting force to pull open the door lock, which then bounced back because of the excessive force.
0:39:4|0:39:11|[Lao Cui] stood there in a daze, and when he finally realized and looked over, the customer in the next corridor was peering at him with curiosity.
0:39:11|0:39:18|The commotion caused by [Lao Cui] made him quickly hide away. After a while, he cautiously stuck his head out, and seeing that everyone had left, he finally opened the door.
0:39:18|0:39:42|In the cabinet lies a bundle of cloth. [Lao Cui] is afraid of having nightmares, so he wraps the whole thing up in a hurry and stuffs it into his arms. Then he gently closes the broken cabinet door, peeks outside, sees no one, and quietly walks out. Just a few steps out, he runs into the onlookers who were watching the commotion earlier.
0:39:42|0:39:50|The guilty Lao Cui dare not look up, just lowering his head and quickening his pace, while the thug at the door presses the trigger, but flames shoot out, turns out it's a lighter.
0:39:51|0:39:57|Xiao Xia scared off the harasser with just one shout.
0:40:1|0:40:12|The two hurriedly left the troubled place with their package and went to a high-end restaurant instead, where the table was filled with delicious dishes like abalone and lobster. They ate heartily.
0:40:18|0:40:26|[Xiao Xia] gestured to the waiter to come over.
0:40:28|0:40:36|After finishing speaking, Lao Cui flipped open his own small bag. Having eaten and drunk his fill, he saw Xiao Xia take out various press credentials from her bag.
0:40:36|0:40:46|Even Lao Cui was scared when he saw the police identification. Xiao Xia searched around again after not finding the money, and this time she was completely stunned.
0:40:52|0:40:57|She showed the gun in her bag to [Lao Cui], which scared him into immediately standing up and sitting back down.
0:41:22|0:41:28|The two of them froze when they heard the price.
0:41:32|0:41:39|The two who couldn't afford the bill could only stall for time, with [Lao Cui] nervously saying to [Xiao Xia].
0:41:51|0:41:57|After speaking, [Lao Cui] started to search his pockets and pushed her hand away.
0:42:10|0:42:29|Under the gaze of the waiter and the lobby manager, [Lao Cui] picked up a hair from the dish, [Xiao Xia] looked solemnly at the manager, and [Xiao Xia] took out fake identification from her bag to start deceiving.
0:42:43|0:42:49|Impersonating the chief editor, [Lao Cui] calmly nodded as [Xiao Xia] tied up her hair with her mouth.
0:43:6|0:43:18|[Lao Cui] and [Xiao Xia] exchanged a glance, both of them sighed solemnly. Then, they walked out the door with their heads held high, took a few steps, suddenly quickened their pace and started to jog, afraid of being discovered.
0:43:52|0:44:1|In the roadside convenience store, the process of [Lao Cui] prying open the cabinet door happened to be playing on TV. Two people watched as [Lao Cui] walked out of the non-member area, with [Xiao Xia] gritting her teeth.
0:44:4|0:44:10|Lao Cui, as quiet as a cicada in winter, quickly turned his head and slipped away.
0:44:21|0:44:24|The two returned to Xiao Xia's house.
0:44:24|0:44:31|Through the crack in the door, many people can be seen busy inside, seemingly searching for something. [Xiao Xia] and [Lao Cui] cautiously approached.
0:44:31|0:44:38|But he didn't notice Tang Jinshan approaching quietly from the corridor behind him.
0:44:54|0:44:57|In the alley, [Xiao Xia] took the lead and led the way to escape.
0:44:57|0:45:4|[Lao Cui] still carried his suitcase and ran wildly, swinging his arms. Tang Jinshan's group was much more ruthless than Guangguang, naturally they chased relentlessly.
0:45:5|0:45:11|Soon, Xiao Xia ran past a temple on the mainland, where a prominent "南无阿弥陀佛" was printed on the wall.
0:45:11|0:45:20|But just as Tang Jinshan's group that had just chased after them began to retreat in the blink of an eye, a large group of people took small steps backward, losing the imposing manner they had just displayed.
0:45:20|0:45:26|It turned out that [Lao Cui] pulled out the gun and pressed Tang Jinshan closely, pointing at the wall.
0:45:52|0:46:0|[Xiao Xia] listens to the conversation outside.
0:46:0|0:46:2|And [Lao Cui] took the opportunity to turn his head and run.
0:46:3|0:46:17|After Tang Jinshan and the others regained their senses, they realized that [Lao Cui] was missing and that they had been tricked. They quickly chased after him, but couldn't determine the direction he had escaped. Tang Jinshan, the leader, chose a direction and gave the order to pursue.
0:46:17|0:46:25|The manhole cover on the ground moved, and it turned out that Lao Cui and Xiao Xia, knowing they were no match, had already slipped into the manhole.
0:46:25|0:46:37|The two of them said in unison. It was only then that they let down their guard and calmed their minds.
0:46:39|0:47:0|[Lao Cui] puts the gun back into the bag, holding the bag tightly against his chest. The key to the problem just now puzzled [Xiao Xia], who shook her head in confusion.
0:47:4|0:47:20|The two of them didn't know how long they had been waiting, until [Xiao Xia] finally brought [Lao Cui] to the residential building. [Xiao Xia] took out the key from the shoe cabinet and opened the door.
0:47:21|0:47:30|The room is a large open space, with the dining room, living room, and bedroom all in one.
0:48:30|0:48:33|The slow-witted Lao Cui finally figured it out,
0:48:33|0:48:43|Suddenly, Lao Cui had a bright idea. Qun Tou was drinking beer with the actress at home, with candles lit beside them.
0:48:44|0:48:52|He put down the wine glass and said solemnly.
0:49:0|0:49:9|At a critical moment, a phone call came in.
0:49:22|0:49:33|Once again he hung up the phone, creating a good atmosphere and holding hands with the actress, fingers interlocked.
0:49:33|0:49:35|The actress was very moved.
0:49:59|0:50:14|After finishing the call, Qun Tou hung up in a hurry and returned to the room. He gently lifted the quietly sobbing actress, his other hand touching her face. He lowered his head in contemplation for a moment before speaking.
0:50:14|0:50:18|[Xiao Xia] lay on the bed and spoke through the curtain.
0:50:33|0:50:41|[Lao Cui] lying on the sofa covered with a blanket, [Lao Cui] said somewhat melancholy.
0:51:30|0:51:36|[Xiao Xia] pondered for a moment.
0:51:43|0:51:52|[Lao Cui], just about to cheer them up, suddenly thought of something and sat up. He tentatively asked.
0:52:4|0:52:9|Upon hearing this, [Lao Cui] smiled reassuringly and lay back down.
0:52:18|0:52:21|[Xiao Xia] took out the passport from the pocket of his clothes.
0:52:21|0:52:25|After hesitating for a moment, she turned back again.
0:52:33|0:52:48|[Xiao Xia] seemed a little guilty. The next morning, the two of them sneakily arrived at a hotel corridor. [Lao Cui] changed into a denim outfit, looking particularly youthful. He gently knocked on the door.
0:52:55|0:53:5|He gave a false name in a hoarse voice, punched the door open, and [Lao Cui] rushed in only to be pushed out again.
0:53:13|0:53:18|The man in the dragon robe was thrown off, [Lao Cui] charged in again, but in a blink of an eye, he backed out on his own.
0:53:32|0:53:40|After an awkward exchange of pleasantries, the actress quickly slipped out the door, and [Lao Cui] then introduced Fist. Fist nodded quickly.
0:53:46|0:53:54|[Lao Cui] sat down awkwardly, and Qun Tou asked with a fist, Qun Tou put on a dragon robe and lit up.
0:54:12|0:54:24|Fist glanced at [Xiao Xia] beside him and pointed, saying. [Xiao Xia] vetoed him.
0:54:42|0:54:46|Disguised [Xiao Xia] and [Lao Cui] once again arrived at the entrance of the bathhouse.
0:54:46|0:54:52|[Lao Cui] instructs [Xiao Xia] as they enter, "There's a bathroom on the left as soon as you come in, it's best to put things there."
0:55:4|0:55:7|Xiao Xia walked nervously towards the bathhouse after finishing her business.
0:55:8|0:55:18|After seeing off Xiao Xia, Lao Cui turned around and saw a wanted poster on the nearby pillar with his own face on it. In a panic, he quickly tore the whole poster off.
0:55:21|0:55:30|Shortly after, wearing that pair of women's sunglasses, [Xiao Xia] nervously surveyed the surroundings. Meanwhile, [Lao Cui] had already entered the bathhouse, where a number of police officers had arrived in the lobby.
0:55:50|0:55:59|[Xiao Xia] turned around to leave, but saw the thug from last time. [Xiao Xia] stepped forward and switched the handguns.
0:56:20|0:56:38|Lao Cui, who secretly brought back the dropped bag, threw the pistol at the door. Lao Cui was still squatting on the ground by the roadside, tearing the wanted poster into pieces in disbelief. Xiao Xia quickly ran over, and Lao Cui picked up the pieces of paper and stood up.
0:56:50|0:56:58|The two took a detour and arrived at the back door of the bathhouse, only to see two police officers on the iron ladder at the back door.
0:57:36|0:57:41|After speaking, [Xiao Xia] turned and left, leaving [Lao Cui] to watch her back as he suddenly turned over and started crying.
0:57:42|0:57:49|[Xiao Xia] once again entered the lobby, but this time it was mostly filled with police officers coming and going.
0:57:51|0:57:59|She put her hands in her pockets, lowered her head, and prepared to bluff her way through.
0:58:2|0:58:8|At that moment, the thug lighting a cigarette pulled the trigger.
0:58:8|0:58:14|The hotel lobby was in chaos, and the hotel staff immediately ran around in panic.
0:58:19|0:58:25|He spoke, then pulled the trigger, and the bullet shot towards the ceiling. The police surrounded him, and [Xiao Xia] also found an opportunity.
0:58:26|0:58:32|Excited [Xiao Xia] danced with joy, venting all the frustration from the harassment that day.
0:58:32|0:58:45|Unimpeded, [Xiao Xia] smoothly entered the men's locker room. She opened a locker, rummaged through her bag, and found a thick envelope. Gently tearing it open, she pulled out the stacked US dollars inside, contentedly whistling to herself.
0:58:46|0:58:54|[Xiao Xia] returned home and sat at the dining table, completely focused on counting the US dollars.
0:59:13|0:59:34|[Lao Cui]'s expression suddenly changed, he solemnly examined the US dollars, then raised them up to look at them in the sunlight.
0:59:42|0:59:51|Xiao Xia listened with only partial understanding, so she also picked up the US dollars and looked at them like Lao Cui, who then exchanged for another bill, shaking it and examining it carefully.
0:59:55|1:0:1|Xiao Xia's face turned serious as she pondered about what happened on the day she received the money.
1:0:13|1:0:24|[Da Bao] struck Tang Jinshan's hand with an axe, and finally [Da Bao] opened the safe, took out a leather bag from inside, and checked the US dollars inside.
1:0:29|1:0:38|Guangguang and the other two left with the money, not long after, Tang Jinshan arrived with his men.
1:0:40|1:0:50|On the basement floor of the mall, Guangguang and the others were running frantically. However, after running out, Da Bao at the back turned around and ran in a different direction alone with the money.
1:0:51|1:0:56|Tang Jinshan covered the wound on his hand and chased after Lao Cui and his men relentlessly.
1:0:58|1:1:7|[Da Bao] ran and pushed aside the pedestrians on the road, running all the way to the bathhouse. He put his bag in the locker room, locked the door, and then went into the bathhouse.
1:1:10|1:1:15|Tang Jinshan was stopped, and [Da Bao] sneaked into the water at this moment.
1:1:15|1:1:24|However, as soon as he got into the water, two thick legs were thrust in, and [Da Bao] held his breath and looked outside, only to see the tattooed big brother coming in for a bath.
1:1:25|1:1:39|Tang Jinshan finally arrived, panting heavily as he surveyed the surroundings. In the water, Da Bao secretly observed the other side. Seeing Tang Jinshan and his men leaving after searching for a while, Da Bao stood up from the water.
1:1:39|1:1:45|The tattooed man in the bath was startled. Meanwhile, Guangguang couldn't get in touch with [Da Bao].
1:2:28|1:2:44|[Lao Cui] was secretly pleased, but [Xiao Xia] remained indifferent. After speaking, [Lao Cui] went to the bathroom, leaving [Xiao Xia] sitting there in a daze.
1:2:52|1:2:55|[Lao Cui] is still daydreaming about the future in the bathroom.
1:2:55|1:3:16|Having made up her mind, [Xiao Xia] walked out with the money. When [Lao Cui], who had just finished using the restroom, looked around the room, he couldn't find any trace of [Xiao Xia]. After scanning the area, he opened the door and called out her name, but there was no response in the empty hallway outside.
1:3:17|1:3:26|Reluctant, [Lao Cui] returned to the room only to find that the bag on the table was missing. He opened a drawer and seemed to be searching for something.
1:3:26|1:3:34|From the bedside table to the desk cabinet, he searched without missing a beat until he found the palm-sized phone book, where he found Guangguang's phone number.
1:3:34|1:3:38|Picked up the phone at home, dialed two numbers, and then put it back.
1:4:6|1:4:17|At the same time, Xiao Xia arrived at the hotel where she had agreed to meet Da Bao and knocked on the door. Da Bao picked up a bottle of wine from the table and went to open the door.
1:4:18|1:4:24|Upon hearing Xiao Xia's voice, he finally relaxed and unlocked the door latch, letting Xiao Xia in.
1:4:24|1:4:30|[Xiao Xia] entered the room, while [Da Bao] stood guard at the door, looking around vigilantly, afraid of being followed.
1:4:31|1:4:39|After locking the door, the long-separated couple embraced each other passionately, with [Da Bao] pressing [Xiao Xia] onto the bed and kissing her.
1:4:41|1:4:48|Upon hearing this, [Da Bao] suddenly stopped what he was doing, slowly stood up, and gazed at [Xiao Xia] in front of him.
1:5:3|1:5:15|[Da Bao] forcefully pushed away [Xiao Xia], took a few steps, turned his back, pondered for a moment, then walked aggressively back to [Xiao Xia]. [Xiao Xia] nervously looked at this familiar man.
1:5:19|1:5:39|[Da Bao] became suspicious, which startled [Xiao Xia], and at that moment, [Da Bao] dialed the home landline. [Xiao Xia] approached and tried to calm him down, but was slapped to the ground by [Da Bao].
1:5:46|1:5:52|After speaking, [Da Bao] dragged and pushed him out the door.
1:5:52|1:6:0|[Xiao Xia] clung tightly to the wall of the corridor. The door of the hotel was locked by [Da Bao], while at the same time, [Lao Cui] arrived at the familiar overpass with a bag in hand.
1:6:0|1:6:7|Compared to the last ridiculous outfit, this time [Lao Cui] lowered his hat brim, wrapped in a coat, calmly walked on the overpass.
1:6:7|1:6:13|The long-awaited Guangguang and Lao Wu smoked and looked at Lao Cui.
1:6:33|1:6:49|[Lao Cui] opened his bag without hesitation, showing it to the two of them. [Lao Wu] jokingly took out a piece of cardboard from his waist, on which the word "passport" was written in watercolor. [Guangguang] held up his homemade passport and walked forward.
1:6:49|1:6:59|[Lao Cui] handed over the briefcase, and suddenly a figure rushed out from the overpass and knocked the briefcase into the air. The briefcase fell from the sky and landed on a three-wheeled cart used for selling fruits.
1:7:40|1:7:48|[Lao Cui] failed to get the passport, knowing that the owner of the fruit stall, Lao Wu, got the briefcase. Dejected, [Lao Cui] returned home with his head down, looking like he had lost his spirit.
1:7:50|1:8:8|He slowly closed the door, only to find [Xiao Xia] sitting on the floor in front of the sofa, holding a whole bottle of red wine and drinking it in one gulp. As the wine went down her throat, she wiped the corners of her mouth, tears welling up in her eyes. [Lao Cui] turned back in disappointment.
1:8:10|1:8:16|However, what he didn't expect was that [Xiao Xia] actually took out her passport, causing [Lao Cui] to have a big change in attitude.
1:8:18|1:8:33|The expression on his face gradually changed from disappointment to anger. [Lao Cui] set down the box and snatched the passport, carefully flipping through it to confirm. Without a doubt, it was his own passport. He angrily threw it to the ground.
1:9:21|1:9:29|[Xiao Xia], who was already feeling aggrieved, now broke down emotionally.
1:10:16|1:10:24|Seeing [Xiao Xia] unable to stop crying, kind-hearted [Lao Cui] had to comfort her first. He put down the suitcase in his hand and brought [Xiao Xia] a cup of hot water.
1:10:24|1:10:34|Sitting on the sofa, [Xiao Xia]'s crying gradually subsided, as [Lao Cui] squatted in front of her with a cup in hand.
1:10:36|1:10:43|Xiao Xia didn't respond, Lao Cui immediately called for an ambulance.
1:10:43|1:10:53|In the carriage, under the care of medical staff, [Xiao Xia] was receiving IV fluids and oxygen, while [Lao Cui] was anxiously holding onto the handrail, watching [Xiao Xia] closely. Finally, [Xiao Xia] woke up.
1:11:20|1:11:31|[Lao Cui] stood there holding a bunch of medicine without saying a word.
1:11:39|1:11:47|[Lao Cui] blinked in confusion, interrupted, and then turned to leave.
1:11:52|1:12:0|[Xiao Xia] became anxious, [Lao Cui] blinked but didn't say anything. However, the clever [Xiao Xia] guessed what was going on, and [Lao Cui] said helplessly.
1:12:3|1:12:8|[Lao Cui] turned and walked away, [Xiao Xia] hesitated before catching up.
1:12:8|1:12:17|The two of them quietly turned the corner of the corridor, not saying another word. [Lao Cui] seemed to have seen something and turned back.
1:13:40|1:13:45|[Lao Cui] had a grim expression and quickened his pace. [Xiao Xia], on the other hand, was all smiles and soon arrived home.
1:13:47|1:13:55|The two got out of the car, one in front and one behind, and arrived at the entrance of the community where they first met. [Xiao Xia] walked quickly inside with a stern face, and [Lao Cui] called out to her.
1:14:5|1:14:16|[Lao Cui] thought for a moment and asked, [Xiao Xia] shook her head, [Lao Cui] pursed his lips, and finally understood.
1:14:18|1:14:24|He moved the box to his left hand, took out a stack of cash from his pocket, nodded, and handed it to [Xiao Xia].
1:14:34|1:14:42|[Lao Cui] put down the suitcase directly, and stuffed cash into [Xiao Xia]'s pocket with both hands. [Xiao Xia], who is tough on the outside but soft on the inside, was touched by this gesture.
1:14:58|1:15:9|[Lao Cui] looked at her and spoke. After speaking, just as he was about to leave, he was called back, and [Lao Cui] turned around slowly.
1:15:22|1:15:32|[Lao Cui] has left, and now it's time for [Xiao Xia] to return to her normal life. When she got back home, [Xiao Xia] took photos of herself with her new phone.
1:15:32|1:15:42|Posing in front of the camera with various cute poses, suddenly, a knocking sound is heard.
1:15:50|1:16:0|[Lao Cui] walked into the house with vegetables in hand, [Xiao Xia] couldn't contain her excitement.
1:16:12|1:16:20|Angry [Guangguang] slammed the tools on the table and smashed towards the makeshift toilet.
1:16:21|1:16:23|The fake US dollars he got made him particularly unhappy.
1:16:23|1:16:30|Lao Cui picked up Xiao Xia's phone on the table out of boredom, then pressed to the voice recording interface, and played the recording.
1:16:51|1:16:54|Guangguang quickly packed up the things on the table and left the room directly.
1:17:11|1:17:19|[Tang Jinshan] handed him the paper, while [Da Bao] was eating instant noodles in the hotel. [Guangguang] kicked the door open with one foot.
1:17:19|1:17:28|He frowned and looked at [Da Bao], sighing deeply. [Xiao Xia] was eating hotpot at home.
1:17:43|1:17:57|[Xiao Xia] said cheerfully. The rising steam from the hotpot set the atmosphere for their farewell, and [Xiao Xia] found her eyes turning red inexplicably. Without lifting her head, [Xiao Xia] spoke.
1:18:0|1:18:7|Lao Cui, with lowered brows, suddenly paused and looked up. Xiao Xia stared at him with red eyes. Lao Cui's gaze seemed evasive.
1:18:15|1:18:22|The speaker's unintentional words struck a chord with Lao Cui, bringing back sad memories.
1:18:57|1:19:7|Xiao Xia smiled and handed a new phone to Lao Cui, saying somewhat proudly.
1:19:11|1:19:17|[Lao Cui] really didn't expect it, feeling a bit touched in his heart, [Xiao Xia] bid farewell to [Lao Cui] after dinner.
1:19:34|1:19:43|[Xiao Xia] jokingly kicked [Lao Cui]'s butt, but couldn't reach it. They both felt a bit sentimental for a moment. [Xiao Xia] then grabbed [Lao Cui]'s hand and placed it on her shoulder.
1:19:45|1:19:53|[Lao Cui] looked at her somewhat timidly, still put down the box, pursed his lips, placed his other hand on her shoulder, and gently embraced her.
1:19:54|1:20:3|[Xiao Xia]'s beautiful eyes filled with mist, and [Lao Cui] blinked, holding back the tears. After a gentle embrace, [Xiao Xia] seemed a bit dissatisfied.
1:20:7|1:20:15|[Xiao Xia] didn't turn around, urging [Lao Cui], who bent down and approached [Xiao Xia]'s belly, saying.
1:20:42|1:20:47|[Xiao Xia] couldn't hold back anymore, reaching out to wipe away her tears fiercely.
1:20:47|1:20:56|Farewells must happen after a long journey, the sentimental [Lao Cui] also picks up his suitcase, takes a step and leaves. [Lao Cui] looks back, dragging the suitcase as he walks.
1:21:5|1:21:12|[Xiao Xia] walked quickly in anger, snatching the suitcase from his hand and pulling out the handle.
1:21:13|1:21:22|Simple-minded [Lao Cui] nodded in agreement, then dragged the suitcase towards the direction of the airport. [Xiao Xia] watched him, then suddenly turned away.
1:21:23|1:21:28|She walked towards the house with her hands in her coat pockets, tears streaming down her face.
1:21:28|1:21:30|And Lao Cui has also arrived at the airport.
1:21:31|1:21:50|In the waiting hall, he inserted the new SIM card into the new phone, put the battery in and closed the back cover carefully. Every move was cautious and steady. When he turned on the phone and saw the wallpaper with a cute cat, heard the lovely ringtone, and saw the beautiful face, it stirred up mixed feelings in [Lao Cui].
1:21:51|1:21:59|[Lao Cui] held the phone in his palm, the old man with a troubled destiny seemed indifferent for a moment, he sighed and looked blankly towards not far away.
1:21:59|1:22:5|Tears quickly filled the eyes, on the weathered face, a look of sorrow involuntarily appeared.
1:22:6|1:22:19|The brief and unexpected encounter carried rich and thrilling memories. Counting every moment, the two went from disdain to fighting side by side, and finally bidding a tearful farewell, tears streaming down [Lao Cui]'s face.
1:22:20|1:22:26|On the other side, Xiao Xia returned home, but as she looked up, a figure emerged from the shadows - it was her boyfriend, Da Bao.
1:22:27|1:22:37|[Xiao Xia] looked at him sideways. The grim-faced [Da Bao] remained silent, and suddenly the door was shut.
1:22:38|1:22:42|[Xiao Xia] suddenly turned around, only to find [Guangguang] hiding behind the door.
1:22:42|1:22:47|Guangguang glared at Xiao Xia, walked up menacingly, and slammed the fake US dollars from the bag on the table.
1:22:52|1:22:59|Lao Cui from the airport was pulling his luggage towards the corridor, his eyes devoid of light. Suddenly, the phone rang.
1:22:59|1:23:7|[Lao Cui], who had been holding his phone all along, glanced at it and immediately answered the call.
1:23:20|1:23:36|[Lao Cui] stood dumbfounded for a moment, then suddenly turned around, grabbed a box, and ran towards the exit against the crowd. The city wall looked somewhat eerie in the night, and [Lao Cui] also arrived at the corner tower. He frantically took out his phone.
1:25:2|1:25:9|[Lao Cui] roared and charged forward, only to be met by [Guangguang]'s dagger. The two of them hung [Lao Cui] upside down on the city wall, slowly lowering his legs.
1:25:28|1:25:34|Guangguang pushed Xiao Xia down, but suddenly a police siren sounded.
1:25:48|1:25:55|Xiao Xia couldn't hold back the bulky Lao Cui, Guangguang and Da Bao were caught by Tang Jinshan's men.
1:26:4|1:26:8|[Tang Jinshan] directed the driver to drive away the car.
1:26:8|1:26:25|The alarm on the city wall gradually faded, and the fist in the corner came out with a horn in a sneaky manner. He looked around and, seeing nothing unusual, accidentally pressed the horn button. He signaled to [Qun Tou].
1:26:35|1:26:42|Xiao Xia is almost unable to hold on, Qun Tou and others pull the person up together.
1:27:6|1:27:20|[Lao Cui] followed by kicking, sent the two into the secret room, then walked up to Tang Jinshan with a flattering smile, and Tang Jinshan had someone stuff [Lao Cui] in.
1:27:38|1:27:43|Back at home, Xiao Xia slumped on the sofa, with Lao Cui sitting next to her, showing concern.
1:27:46|1:27:53|[Lao Cui] was bored and absentmindedly shining a UV light on a dollar bill. [Lao Cui] didn't respond immediately, as if lost in thought.
1:27:55|1:28:13|After thinking for a while, [Lao Cui] still didn't know what to do. [Xiao Xia] slowly turned her head, her eyes empty. Suddenly, [Lao Cui] raised his head, blinked his eyes, as if calculating something, and put the counterfeit money detector back on the table.
1:28:14|1:28:23|[Xiao Xia] saw that he did not respond, looking a bit dejected. [Lao Cui] then let out a faint sigh, spoke slowly and weakly.
1:28:29|1:28:33|[Xiao Xia] gave him a strange look, feeling slightly dissatisfied.
1:28:33|1:28:42|But this was Lao Cui's biggest concession. He sat up with a pout, picked up the counterfeit money detector on the table, and couldn't help but smile as he shone it on the US dollars on the table.
1:28:42|1:28:49|The ultraviolet lamp in his hand shines here for a while, then shines there, like the footprints of the two people running around these days.
1:28:49|1:28:57|The weary Lao Cui slowly buried his head in the collar of his down jacket, while the attentive Xiao Xia suddenly noticed a clue on the US dollar.
1:29:12|1:29:31|The two spread the banknotes on the ground in order, a tedious process that nonetheless captivated them. [Lao Cui] checked the bills with a counterfeit detector light, while [Xiao Xia] kept changing their positions and order.
1:29:31|1:29:46|[Lao Cui] took a pencil and carefully traced the words on the banknotes, some of which even had strange lines on them. [Lao Cui] focused intently on the task. Time passed unnoticed, and eventually the banknotes on the table formed a picture.
1:29:46|1:29:51|The two sat cross-legged on the floor, carefully examining this strange and rare painting.
1:29:51|1:29:55|The crisscrossing dashed and solid lines form this huge map.
1:29:59|1:30:8|The two looked at each other in shock.
1:30:16|1:30:19|A group of henchmen rushed up and firmly restrained [Lao Cui].
1:30:19|1:30:23|[Lao Cui] fought back, but was no match, as his little brother shouted loudly.
1:30:42|1:30:52|The timely arrival of the police unexpectedly became the savior of the two.
1:30:52|1:30:58|A group of people were escorted downstairs, while the neighbor at the door, with bandages tied around him, gleefully cracked melon seeds.
1:30:58|1:31:2|[Xiao Xia], who was walking at the back, casually turned off the lights and locked the door.
1:31:4|1:31:9|Lao Cui looked back and met eyes with Xiao Xia.
1:31:9|1:31:12|[Xiao Xia] couldn't help but show a joyful expression on her face, smiling brightly.
1:31:12|1:31:22|[Lao Cui] quickly turned around, walked forward, and the neighbor suddenly became alert, stepping back. [Lao Cui] tightly held her hand and said.
1:31:44|1:31:46|In Tang Jinshan's company, the police heard a strange noise.
1:31:47|1:31:58|Several police comrades pulled open the clothes in the wardrobe and listened closely. Lao Wu in the dark room had already been beaten black and blue, even his clothes were stripped off.
1:31:58|1:32:0|He is banging his head against the wall.
1:32:31|1:32:45|[Lao Cui] dragged the suitcase and walked towards the boarding gate.
1:32:45|1:32:51|And when everything calmed down, [Xiao Xia] also walked home alone in a daze.
1:32:51|1:33:8|The quiet street was filled with traffic, but it had nothing to do with her. Just then, a police car stopped in front of her, and the window rolled down to reveal a familiar face in the back seat.
