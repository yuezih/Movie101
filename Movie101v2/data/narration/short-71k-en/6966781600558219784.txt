0:3:12|0:3:25|[Hu Bayi] threw stones into the tomb, triggering the mechanism. Burning arrows shot up like sparks from the ground, and the three of them dodged the arrows with shovels in hand.
0:3:43|0:4:12|[Shirley Yang] is hanging above the suspended coffin, preparing to install the hook for the coffin. [Wang Kaixuan] is manipulating the tombstone statues nearby, accidentally triggering a mechanism. Suddenly, the suspended coffin shoots out large crossbow arrows in all directions. Seeing the danger, [Wang Kaixuan] inadvertently breaks the rope in his hand, causing [Shirley Yang] to fall onto the suspended coffin.
0:4:12|0:4:17|On the other hand, [Wang Kaixuan] lost his balance while dodging arrows and was about to fall into the tomb.
0:4:17|0:4:46|[Hu Bayi] saw the situation was critical, he quickly threw out the Flying Tiger Claw. The three claws of the Flying Tiger Claw caught in the gap of the railing, catching the falling [Wang Kaixuan]. [Hu Bayi] quickly stabilized his stance, one hand hanging low at the abdomen, the other hand raised high over the shoulder, as if capturing an eagle, firmly holding [Wang Kaixuan]. The crisis passed, and the three continued to open the coffin. [Hu Bayi] and [Wang Kaixuan] held the rope at both ends.
0:4:46|0:5:9|The two of them struggled to pull up the rope, only to hear the bell on the coffin suddenly ringing. A strange dark purple flame suddenly spewed out from the hanging coffin, very eerie. When the eerie flame dispersed, the female corpse in the coffin was unexpectedly covered with a red veil. [Hu Bayi] climbed onto the coffin, and through the red veil, he discovered that the female corpse had skin like jade, seemingly not a dead person, all of a sudden.
0:5:9|0:5:18|In the tomb chamber, a chilling wind blows, causing the candlelight to change from red to green.
0:5:28|0:6:0|With a heavy heart, [Hu Bayi] sighed inwardly. He reached out and lifted the red veil from the woman's body, only to see the corpse suddenly open its eyes, as if trying to steal [Hu Bayi]'s soul. At that moment, the coffin creaked and cracked open, sending wood chips flying everywhere. Both he and the woman were thrown into the air, unexpectedly meeting like old friends. They reached out their arms towards each other, trying to touch, but were just a fingertip away.
0:6:0|0:6:8|[Hu Bayi] was unable to save the female corpse and could only watch as it fell, causing the surrounding graveyard to collapse.
0:6:10|0:6:26|The dream is here, waking up Hu Bayi leaning against the door frame. He looks pale, panting heavily. The trio of tomb raiders has already moved to New York, with Wang Kaixuan selling antiques on the street.
0:6:30|0:6:39|[Wang Kaixuan] enthusiastically shouted at the foreigners.
0:6:39|0:6:45|[Wang Kaixuan] looked disdainful,
0:6:45|0:6:52|He then patted his chest,
0:7:24|0:7:50|[Wang Kaixuan] pretended that someone was behind him, causing the foreigner to turn around. [Wang Kaixuan] accidentally bumped into piles of cardboard boxes.
0:7:51|0:8:13|[Hu Bayi] had just pulled [Wang Kaixuan] up and was about to continue running when [Shirley Yang] drove up in front of them. She pointed at [Hu Bayi], prompting [Wang Kaixuan] to stick his head out. Seeing Detective Du Han and his men chasing after them, [Hu Bayi] quickly opened the car door and got into [Shirley Yang]'s car, only to hear a loud roar.
0:8:13|0:8:31|[Shirley Yang] stepped on the gas pedal, turning the steering wheel with both hands to shake off the pursuit of the immigration officers. Looking down, the Chrysler Building sparkled in the sun, and suddenly the city was filled with swirling sand and dust. As the golden sand settled, the three words "Seeking the Dragon's Secret" appeared in the air.
0:8:33|0:9:19|[Shirley Yang] drove the two to under the bridge. Upon hearing this, [Hu Bayi] remained unusually indifferent. [Shirley Yang] hesitated in her tone.
0:10:6|0:10:14|[Hu Bayi] looked angry, then opened the car door and walked away in a huff, before standing alone by the river in a daze.
0:10:49|0:11:16|[Shirley Yang] listened to [Wang Kaixuan], but her attention was focused on [Hu Bayi]. [Wang Kaixuan] grabbed the touch gold talisman on [Hu Bayi]'s chest, feeling very resentful in his heart, and quickly walked to [Hu Bayi]'s side.
0:11:17|0:11:42|Unexpectedly, upon hearing this, [Hu Bayi] without even looking, swiftly pulled down the ghost-catching talisman, wrapped the rope around it, and walked briskly towards the riverbank. Without any hesitation, he tossed the talisman into the river, leaving [Wang Kaixuan] standing there in shock.
0:11:42|0:11:48|[Hu Bayi] just nodded and still chose to leave.
0:11:48|0:11:57|In the night of New York, as the lights came on, the whole city was brightly lit, [Da Jinya] unabashedly showing off his shiny gold tooth.
0:12:28|0:12:42|With great effort, the translation was being done diligently when suddenly, [Wang Kaixuan] pushed the door open.
0:15:3|0:15:30|The next day, the reflection of trees and houses was cast on the window of [Hu Bayi] by the sunlight. Anxious [Shirley Yang] came to his house looking for him. [Shirley Yang] searched the first floor but couldn't find him, so she quickly climbed the stairs to the second floor, only to see [Hu Bayi] sleeping in the tent.
0:15:48|0:16:27|[Hu Bayi] couldn't help but stop in his tracks. Upon hearing this, [Shirley Yang] quickly walked towards [Hu Bayi]. [Hu Bayi] continued to act dumb and walked down the stairs. As soon as [Shirley Yang] finished speaking, she threw the document bag in her hand to [Hu Bayi]. He took the bag, opened it, and found a videotape inside.
0:16:28|0:16:35|Shirley Yang just sneered in contempt.
0:17:12|0:17:26|[Shirley Yang] was curious when she first heard about [Ding Sitian], so she sat down next to [Hu Bayi].
0:17:26|0:17:34|At this point, [Hu Bayi] began to tell [Shirley Yang] the story about [Ding Sitian] from years ago.
0:18:28|0:19:7|The sun gradually dissipated, and the grassland was about to welcome the night. The pickup truck was driving on a bumpy road, and the young people in the car were unusually restless. The driver quickly got out of the car to check the situation, leaving the young people puzzled for a moment.
0:19:58|0:20:19|The young people looked puzzled, [Hu Bayi] took out a compass for exploration, and the compass needle spun wildly.
0:21:18|0:21:24|With the collapse of the stone statue, the young intellectuals were filled with momentum and continued to conquer other stone statues.
0:21:27|0:22:8|Hu Bayi quickly bent down and pressed his ear to the ground. The buzzing sound kept surging from the depths. After the stone statue was pushed over, a towering black pillar instantly rose from the remaining hole in the ground. The black pillar scattered in all directions, resembling a city shrouded in black clouds.
0:22:8|0:22:45|A young intellectual waved a shovel to drive away grasshoppers, but was still covered by them. When the grasshoppers dispersed, the young intellectual had become a dried corpse. The grasshoppers seemed to have not tasted human blood for many years, but now they were extremely ferocious after their first taste. Each young intellectual killed by the grasshoppers looked like a terrifying dried corpse. The pursuit of the grasshoppers continued, and [Wang Kaixuan] accidentally fell while trying to avoid them, but in doing so, he discovered a place of refuge.
0:22:45|0:23:16|Ding Sitian accidentally sprained her ankle and fell down. Seeing the grasshoppers approaching, [Hu Bayi] quickly carried the injured Ding Sitian to find shelter. [Hu Bayi] hurriedly used a piece of wood to block the door, while the young people took out their clothes to seal the gaps in the door. The sound of impacts was incessant, but the grasshoppers ultimately failed to break through.
0:23:17|0:23:50|When the grasshoppers dispersed, the educated youth in the shelter lit torches. Just as everyone was immersed in sorrow, a loud noise suddenly startled them all.
0:23:53|0:24:0|[Hu Bayi] quickly got up to comfort everyone.
0:24:2|0:24:42|[Hu Bayi] opened the door in [Wang Kaixuan]'s mouth. [Wang Kaixuan] held a torch but almost tripped. He walked up the iron staircase, stepping around with his feet. Little Ding led the female educated youth down the stairs, but the staircase, long neglected, collapsed upon touch, sending them falling heavily into the depths. The torch illuminated the side of [Hu Bayi]'s face as he pushed open another iron door.
0:24:43|0:25:10|But still couldn't find a way out. The educated youth were holding torches and searching everywhere for an exit, while Ding Sitian followed closely behind [Hu Bayi].
0:25:45|0:26:9|[Hu Bayi] extended the torch downwards and unexpectedly found an explosive package. He quickly moved the torch away. Meanwhile, [Wang Kaixuan] continued to hold the torch and led everyone to shuttle through the underground works, searching for a way out. He took the lead through the exposed steel reinforcement passage, with the others following behind, feeling somewhat scared. [Wang Kaixuan] looked up and spotted a scrapped mechanical device.
0:26:50|0:27:10|[Wang Kaixuan] exerted all his strength to turn the generator. As soon as the generator started successfully, he closed the circuit breaker. The light bulb, changing from dim to bright, signaled the arrival of electricity.
0:27:10|0:27:45|The female educated youth was startled by a skeleton at her feet, and [Hu Bayi] looked around at the situation of the underground construction upon seeing the dried corpse on the ground.
0:27:45|0:28:19|[Hu Bayi] looked into the distance and seemed to have discovered something. He raised his hand and pointed towards the distance, while the female educated youth stood on the high platform.
0:28:19|0:29:0|[Wang Kaixuan], [Hu Bayi], and [Ding Sitian] were exploring the underground construction site. [Hu Bayi] casually took out a knife, wiped it clean, and handed it to Ding. Seeing this, [Wang Kaixuan] picked up a military shovel, determined to protect Ding.
0:29:38|0:29:55|[Hu Bayi] chased after the educated youth, who completely ignored him and kept shouting slogans as they rushed deeper. When [Hu Bayi] caught up with them, he was stunned by the scene in front of him.
0:29:57|0:30:23|Suddenly, a purple light descended from above, and purple mist rose from the ground. [Hu Bayi] and the others couldn't bear the strong light and immediately raised their hands to shield their eyes. As the purple light gradually dissipated, large chunks of dust and debris floated down from the sky. [Hu Bayi] and the others lowered their arms and struggled to open their eyes.
0:30:23|0:30:37|As soon as the words fell, the male educated youth, Hu Bayi, suppressed his fear, holding a Type 38 rifle and firing two shots in a row. However, the zombie had long been dead, and the bullets couldn't harm it in the slightest.
0:30:37|0:31:0|With a slash of the samurai sword, [Hu Bayi]'s arm fell off, and the surrounding dried corpses were stimulated by the blood, their sunken eyes unexpectedly flashing with a bloody light. The tragic scene continued as the young intellectuals picked up various weapons and fought desperately against the advancing dried corpses. Seeing the situation turning dire, they fought their way out of the encirclement of the dried corpses.
0:31:1|0:31:27|[Hu Bayi] and [Wang Kaixuan] were eager to pull Ding Sitian away. Meanwhile, the mummy seized the opportunity to raise the samurai sword high and strike down. Seeing this, [Hu Bayi] seized the mummy's weapon, only to have it instantly turn into ashes when he swung it towards the mummy. [Hu Bayi] stood still in shock, as the mummy and he engaged in a struggle. Ding Sitian tried to step forward to rescue [Hu Bayi], but was instantly grabbed by the mummy by the collar.
0:31:27|0:31:57|[Hu Bayi] broke free from the dried corpse, leaped forward, kicked the dried corpse away, and then pounced towards [Wang Kaixuan]. [Wang Kaixuan] was unable to dodge and was knocked down by the dried corpse. Ding Sitian tried to seize the opportunity to pull [Wang Kaixuan] away, but unexpectedly, the kicked dried corpse fell on the detonator in the underground works. With a loud bang, a huge explosion occurred, accompanied by endless flames and smoke billowing out in an instant.
0:31:57|0:32:14|Countless dried corpses were instantly engulfed by flames. [Hu Bayi] quickly cleared a path, leading [Wang Kaixuan] and Ding Sitian to escape. Explosions were happening everywhere, and the passageway had already been taken over by flames and dust.
0:32:21|0:32:37|[Hu Bayi] and [Wang Kaixuan] escaped from the underground tunnel, sitting on the grass, watching the raging fire burning for a long time without dispersing.
0:32:37|0:33:9|Looking into the distance, the two of them saw the rising sun amidst the clouds, dyeing the sky red, a spectacular scene. [Hu Bayi] was lost in his own thoughts about what happened 20 years ago, pouring himself a glass of wine and offering it to the ancestral portrait on the altar. After toasting to the ancestral portrait, [Hu Bayi] stood there, lost in contemplation.
0:33:10|0:33:53|[Shirley Yang] looked at [Hu Bayi] for a long time, while [Hu Bayi] stood still, trying hard to recall his own firsthand experience 20 years ago. As he spoke, he walked to the window.
0:34:12|0:34:47|[Hu Bayi] sneered, his expression full of disdain for [Shirley Yang]'s words. He turned his head to look at [Shirley Yang], who immediately saw through [Hu Bayi]'s hidden agenda.
0:34:48|0:35:28|[Hu Bayi] answered nervously to [Shirley Yang], who gritted her teeth with anger. [Hu Bayi] left without looking back, and the closing door seemed to signal [Shirley Yang]'s complete departure.
0:35:28|0:35:56|Sitian's words fell, [Shirley Yang] stood still and gazed at [Hu Bayi], saying little before moving on to the lush grass. [Wang Kaixuan] couldn't help but recite a poem.
0:39:45|0:40:3|[Wang Kaixuan] saw the same scene as 20 years ago, recalling the moment when he saw the sunrise, while he himself was sitting on the ground crying uncontrollably.
0:40:4|0:40:43|[Wang Kaixuan] turned around and looked back. The distant mountain peaks still resembled the image in his memory. At this moment, an old open-top jeep was driving on the rugged grassland road, playing a melodious Mongolian folk song.
0:43:28|0:43:39|At this moment, the sound of the grassland folk song caught the attention of [Shirley Yang], but what caught [Shirley Yang]'s attention was a motorcycle next to the toy horse.
0:43:39|0:43:55|[Shirley Yang] couldn't help but feel anxious, quickly walked towards Aji, squatted in front of Aji, took out a toy from her pocket and placed it in front of Aji. At this moment, with the sun setting in the west, [Hu Bayi] rode a horse galloping on the grassland.
0:43:55|0:44:10|As the sound of the horn approached, [Shirley Yang] rode a motorcycle closely following [Hu Bayi]. When he turned his head, he was suddenly surprised to see [Shirley Yang]. She was driving the motorcycle carelessly and even waved provocatively at him.
0:44:52|0:45:31|[Wang Kaixuan] patrolled around the giant pit where the workers were working. Holding a rope, he slowly lowered a birdcage into the deep pit, trying to determine if the air underground was normal. Unaware that Mark's men were retrieving the signal receiver, [Wang Kaixuan] heard the conversation and couldn't help but look up at [Mark].
0:46:6|0:46:34|With a loud noise, the stone door opened, revealing a deep corridor behind it. Despite the light shining in, the darkness inside the corridor remained unclear. At this moment, [Hu Bayi] led two subordinates towards the stone door, only to hear a howling wind from inside. Shining the flashlight, they could only see a misty fog in the darkness.
0:46:35|0:47:6|It seems that a monster is rushing towards [Hu Bayi], instantly surrounding [Hu Bayi] and the other two. Unable to bear the fear, [Hu Bayi] and the others hurriedly retreat, waving their scabbards in the air.
0:47:22|0:48:0|[Da Jinya] looked at the exquisite murals in the corridor and felt that his life was more important. He quickly picked up the helmet and skillfully put it on his head, then followed [Wang Kaixuan] through the dim corridor into a spacious stone cave.
0:48:0|0:48:30|[Wang Kaixuan] was extremely disgusted by the horse-riding skeleton in [Da Jinya]'s mouth. Feeling at home, [Wang Kaixuan] took [Da Jinya] to a crevice to investigate. As he squeezed into the crevice, he found the top covered with cloth strips.
0:48:30|0:49:3|Below the cloth strip are tied with bells, [Wang Kaixuan] and [Da Jinya] walked past the cloth strip, while [Ying Caihong] was curious about the standing skeleton in the grotto, so she carefully approached to take a closer look. [Ma Dongmei] climbed onto the platform, climbed onto the horse, reached out to the skeleton's abdomen, and took the copper plate from the skeleton's abdomen.
0:49:3|0:49:25|Gently wiping off the dust on the copper plate, feeling quite pleased with himself, Hu Bayi then dismounted and wrapped the copper plate in white cloth. He handed the copper plate to Ying Caihong with almost a fawning manner. Ying Caihong took the white cloth and the copper plate, holding it in her hands and carefully examining the mystery of the copper plate. A sudden noise interrupted Ying Caihong's contemplation.
0:49:27|0:49:51|The stone base under the skeleton slowly rose, and the subordinates quickly protected [Ying Caihong] away from the base. Suddenly, the strange noises became more intense. [Ying Caihong] followed the sound and saw many sealed stone doors slowly opening in the stone cave. Suddenly, strong winds blew out from the opened stone doors. Seeing this, [Hu Bayi] quickly raised his arm high, trying to block the dust blowing towards him.
0:49:51|0:50:4|The skull has turned into ashes, penetrating everywhere. [Da Jinya] and [Wang Kaixuan] are completely unaware of what's happening outside, still searching in the stone crevices.
0:50:4|0:50:21|At this moment, [Hu Bayi], [Hu Bayi] advised the other two not to worry about the flying ashes at all, but the two of them kept coughing more and more violently, pounding their chests and stamping their feet in frustration.
0:50:21|0:50:30|Mark seemed to have a physical reaction as well. He stopped in his tracks and began to cough violently, his throat moving up and down as if trying to cough out his internal organs before finally stopping.
0:50:30|0:50:39|The bizarre actions of Mark and the others caused astonishment among [Ying Caihong] and the rest, who were eager to investigate their situation. The three of them continued to cough persistently.
0:50:39|0:51:15|Mark, seemingly unwilling, quickly tore open his sleeve, only to see the same dark veins appearing on his arm. [Ying Caihong] and the others were shocked by the scene before them, stopping to watch. Mark couldn't hide his fear and screamed out.
0:51:15|0:51:48|Yangzi waved the dagger in her hand, trying to end Mark and the other two. Wang Kaixuan explored back to the cave, and as he spoke, Mark, who had just been killed by Yangzi, stood up from the ground.
0:51:49|0:52:3|The crowd saw Mark stand up again, while his colleague on the ground let out a piercing scream, only to see dark blue veins like Mark's spreading all over his palm in an instant.
0:52:3|0:52:29|Yangzi quickly cut off the arm of the poisoned person, while [Wang Kaixuan] and [Da Jinya] panicked and fled into a crevice. Inside the cave, the attacks from the mummies did not stop. Despite everyone wielding batons to surround and attack the mummies, it was ineffective. Instead, the mummies, with their strange strength, easily knocked them to the ground.
0:52:30|0:53:6|At this moment, while [Wang Kaixuan] and [Da Jinya] were busy walking with their heads down, they unexpectedly ran to the edge of a crack in the ground. When [Wang Kaixuan] and the others stopped, with a command from [Wang Kaixuan], [Da Jinya] couldn't hide his fear and immediately ran off, wishing he had more pairs of legs. As soon as [Da Jinya] was the first to rush out of the crack, [Wang Kaixuan] quickly pulled out the black donkey hooves and started dancing.
0:53:6|0:53:37|[Wang Kaixuan] finished reciting the spell, then directly stuffed the black donkey hoof into Mark's mouth. Mark instantly stood still in place, not moving at all, his neighing becoming more piercing. He then took the black donkey hoof out of his mouth with ease.
0:53:37|0:54:16|The two clenched their teeth and pushed hard, knocking Mark to the ground. Suddenly, a monster rushed out and pushed [Wang Kaixuan] down. [Wang Kaixuan] used a military shovel to wrestle with the monster on the ground. Suddenly, a flying tiger claw flew from a distance and hooked onto the monster's clothes. Upon hearing [Wang Kaixuan] give a secret signal, [Hu Bayi] couldn't help but smile knowingly, but [Wang Kaixuan] was not pleased.
0:54:17|0:54:49|[Shirley Yang] speaks up for [Hu Bayi], who leaps across a deep crevice to knock down the monster. Meanwhile, [Wang Kaixuan] struggles in a fight with another creature. The three of them, along with [Shirley Yang], manage to escape after a fierce battle, but unfortunately, one of [Ying Caihong]'s men accidentally detonates a bomb on himself.
0:55:25|0:56:1|[Shirley Yang] and [Wang Kaixuan] wield their weapons, buying time for [Hu Bayi], while [Da Jinya] quickly legs it away.
0:56:1|0:56:35|Shirley Yang inadvertently got entangled by the surrounding monsters. At this moment, Hu Bayi led the remaining people in the stone cave to rush into the stone gate of the virtual dog. When everyone ran out of the passage and arrived on the stone platform, they found themselves in a desperate situation.
0:59:33|0:59:59|With a gunshot, [Da Jinya] stood frozen on the spot, looking incredulously at his feet. [Ying Caihong] smiled knowingly upon hearing it, on the wooden plank path along the cliff.
0:59:59|1:0:14|[Hu Bayi] led the way with a flashlight, while [Wang Kaixuan] carried [Da Jinya] who was shot in the leg. The three of them walked on the narrow plank path, and [Da Jinya] accidentally bumped his head.
1:0:22|1:0:55|[Hu Bayi] reached into his shoe and slowly pulled out a rope, with the other end tied to a touch gold talisman. [Wang Kaixuan] exclaimed when he saw it.
1:0:55|1:1:34|In this place, there is a huge underground space, but the broken tiles and ruins are scattered all over the ground. The bridge is a suspension bridge made of iron cables and wooden planks, guarded by two eerie stone pillars. As soon as they arrived, everyone began to survey the surroundings.
1:1:34|1:1:42|[Shirley Yang] cautiously stepped onto the iron cable bridge with a flashlight in hand, slowly lowering her body and extending a foot to test the safety of the bridge.
1:1:43|1:1:59|[Hu Bayi] saw that she was about to take a risk, so he quickly reached out to stop her, but ended up walking alone on the long-neglected iron cable bridge.
1:2:3|1:2:10|The group followed in the footsteps of [Hu Bayi] across the iron chain bridge, only to be greeted by a vast underground cavern.
1:2:30|1:2:58|Among the countless dark green stone pillars standing upright in the water, connected by iron rope bridges, at this moment, [Ying Caihong]'s two subordinates are eager to step onto the iron rope bridge. [Hu Bayi] quickly speaks out to stop them, but they ignore his advice and proceed. Seeing no danger on the iron rope bridge, they let down their guard, unaware of the eerie green ghost fire rising beneath their feet.
1:3:1|1:3:17|The two had never seen such a bizarre formation before. In a panic, they used both hands and feet to pat out the ghostly fire beneath them. However, the ghostly fire, as they patted it, grew more and more intense, spreading in an instant from their legs to engulf their entire bodies.
1:3:21|1:3:41|[Shirley Yang] took off the bracelet and threw it onto the bridge deck. As the bracelet passed by, green ghostly fire ignited in its wake. Upon hearing this, [Hu Bayi] turned his head and gave a disdainful look. [Shirley Yang] met his gaze provocatively, warning that the bridge deck would catch fire with just a touch.
1:3:43|1:3:53|[Hu Bayi] picked up a piece of cloth and wiped it on the bridge deck. With a crackling sound, the cloth in his hand ignited a dark green ghostly fire. [Hu Bayi] casually threw away the cloth.
1:4:35|1:4:42|[Hu Bayi] immediately took out the compass,
1:5:22|1:5:37|[Hu Bayi], [Wang Kaixuan], and [Shirley Yang] were the first to step onto the iron cable bridge. [Da Jinya] was worried, but the three of them paid no attention to his words, cautiously feeling their way forward on the bridge.
1:5:37|1:6:6|[Ying Caihong] and others on the shore watched as [Hu Bayi] and his group successfully crossed the iron cable bridge. Seeing [Hu Bayi] and the others pass safely, [Ying Caihong] and her group also stepped onto the iron cable bridge. [Hu Bayi] and his group, along with [Ying Caihong] and her team, stepped onto the maze-like iron cable bridge one after another, advancing in the underground ancient ruins where few people had been before. All around, only the sound of gurgling water and the swaying of people crossing the iron cable bridge could be heard.
1:6:6|1:6:11|The ancient ruins were crowded, yet still appeared very desolate.
1:6:16|1:6:31|As soon as [Hu Bayi] finished speaking, everyone left the eerie statue. [Ying Caihong] and her group approached, stepping onto the stone pillar. They carefully examined the statue sitting on the skull base here.
1:6:36|1:7:5|[Yangzi] received the order from [Ying Caihong], and immediately took the copper emblem from the sculpture's chest and handed it to [Ying Caihong] beside her. Before [Ying Caihong] could examine it closely, the sculpture suddenly underwent a transformation. A dark green ghostly fire emerged from the sculpture's eyes and mouth, startling [Ying Caihong] and her companions. The fire quickly intensified, spreading rapidly across the entire stone pillar. [Yangzi] quickly shielded [Ying Caihong] and the others, allowing them to escape. The dark green ghostly fire grew larger and more intense, seeming to have a spreading wildfire effect.
1:7:10|1:7:47|In the distance, Hu Bayi and his group noticed the abnormality of the stone pillar. The stone pillar was now unbearable under the burning flames, cracking and breaking apart. Da Jinya urged Wang Kaixuan and the others to escape quickly. As the stone seats collapsed one by one, Hu Bayi and his group immediately ran away. Da Jinya lay on Wang Kaixuan's back as they rushed towards the exit. Hu Bayi looked back and saw that Ying Caihong's group was still trapped on the iron cable bridge.
1:7:50|1:7:56|Da Jinya's helmet was ablaze, [Shirley Yang] acted quickly and slapped off Da Jinya's helmet.
1:8:1|1:8:10|[Hu Bayi] and the others made up their minds and headed towards the exit. Yangzi took out a fireproof asbestos suit and helped [Ying Caihong] put it on, marking the end of the fire crisis.
1:8:12|1:8:46|[Hu Bayi] and his companions turned around and arrived at a spacious underground square. The square was filled with scattered rocks and countless white mists floating on the ground. Before Da Jinya could finish speaking, [Wang Kaixuan] directly threw Da Jinya off his back onto the ground.
1:8:47|1:9:25|[Hu Bayi] turned around and looked at [Wang Kaixuan] sitting on a rock. [Wang Kaixuan] took out a cigarette, and [Hu Bayi] looked at the cigarette in his hand, his expression changing instantly. [Wang Kaixuan] raised his head and stared at [Hu Bayi] beside him, with [Shirley Yang] in between the two. [Wang Kaixuan] stood up.
1:9:25|1:9:50|With an angry expression, [Hu Bayi] walked towards [Wang Kaixuan]. Upon hearing this, [Hu Bayi] took strides towards [Wang Kaixuan], glaring at him with wide eyes. [Shirley Yang] seemed like a resentful young wife, with a face full of dejection, lost in thought. The two couldn't help but reminisce about the beautiful times 20 years ago, with herds of cattle and sheep running on the grassland under the setting sun.
1:9:50|1:10:24|[Hu Bayi] ignored [Wang Kaixuan]'s request, took a deep drag of his cigarette, and snatched the letter from [Wang Kaixuan]'s hand. [Wang Kaixuan] had written a love poem. As [Wang Kaixuan] grabbed [Hu Bayi] from behind, then released him, [Hu Bayi] finally began to carefully read the love poem in his hand.
1:10:24|1:11:7|[Wang Kaixuan] was feeling extremely awkward for a moment. [Hu Bayi] couldn't help but laugh as he read the contents of the love poem in his hand. He stared at [Wang Kaixuan] in front of him, while Ding Sitian gently fastened the military star badge that [Hu Bayi] had given her to her chest, her expression unusually awkward.
1:11:8|1:11:42|[Hu Bayi] gazed affectionately at Ding Sitian beside him. When Ding Sitian suddenly looked up and met his gaze, [Hu Bayi] quickly turned his head away. Ding Sitian didn't respond to his words, but looked at [Hu Bayi] with deep affection in her eyes, eagerly awaiting his next words.
1:12:17|1:12:22|Wang Kaixuan seems to have noticed something?
1:12:22|1:12:53|[Wang Kaixuan] stood still after speaking, and after finishing his words, he chuckled self-deprecatingly, looking up and down at [Hu Bayi] in front of him. [Wang Kaixuan] choked up as he spoke.
1:12:53|1:13:26|[Hu Bayi] stared at [Wang Kaixuan]. After [Wang Kaixuan] finished speaking, [Hu Bayi] suppressed the sadness in his heart. Adjusting his emotions, [Wang Kaixuan] looked [Hu Bayi] up and down. As the conversation reached this point, [Hu Bayi] recalled the cause of Ding's death 20 years ago. The accidental explosion of the mummified corpse triggered the underground explosives, causing a deafening explosion, echoing in their ears. Endless flames and smoke instantly surged into the air.
1:13:27|1:13:49|Explosions were happening everywhere inside the underground construction, with flames shooting up and smoke filling the air. Countless rocks were flying around due to the shockwaves from the explosions. The underground construction was exploding more intensely, and roaring flames were gushing out from all directions. [Wang Kaixuan] quickly pulled Ding Sitian into the elevator for cover.
1:13:49|1:14:19|[Hu Bayi] quickly started the elevator, which slowly ascended. The three of them thought they had escaped, but the flames chased after them along the elevator shaft. Suddenly, the elevator jammed, and Ding Sitian accidentally stepped through a wooden board and fell. [Hu Bayi] quickly bent down to grab Ding Sitian as she fell, shooting around frantically. Ding Sitian made up her mind and pulled out a knife.
1:14:19|1:14:28|Attempting to cut the wood with a knife, Ding Sitian accidentally drops the knife, leading to an explosion below. Ding Sitian is determined to go through with it.
1:14:29|1:14:52|With both hands breaking free from Hu Bayi's pull, Ding Sitian stood alone on the beam. Ignoring all advice, she listened to the shouts of Hu Bayi and Wang Kaixuan, extending her arm and leaping into the air. However, falling just short, Hu Bayi was unable to save Ding.
1:14:55|1:15:24|Ding Sitian accidentally fell into the fire below and was instantly engulfed by flames. With Ding Sitian's sacrifice, Hu Bayi and Wang Kaixuan managed to escape at the critical moment. Hu Bayi dragged the crying Wang Kaixuan to safety, but at the exit, flames shot up and thick smoke filled the air. Wang Kaixuan, struggling to accept Ding Sitian's sacrifice, was torn between wanting to rescue him from the fire and collapsing on the ground in tears.
1:15:24|1:15:39|[Hu Bayi] was also in great pain, only to see him holding back tears, standing still looking towards the raging fire, while [Wang Kaixuan] watched the incense burning quietly on the rock, feeling extremely heavy-hearted.
1:15:41|1:15:50|[Wang Kaixuan] lightly pursed his lips, calming his emotions.
1:15:50|1:16:27|Shirley Yang listened to what Wang Kaixuan said, for a moment at a loss for words. Wang Kaixuan felt full of resentment in his heart, leaving Shirley Yang speechless, standing there.
1:16:27|1:16:55|[Hu Bayi] contemplated for a long time before making up his mind. He turned around and walked slowly to [Wang Kaixuan]. With a smile, [Hu Bayi] looked at [Wang Kaixuan]. Upon hearing this, [Wang Kaixuan] was extremely excited, choked up and almost unable to speak. [Wang Kaixuan] patted [Hu Bayi] heavily on the shoulder.
1:16:55|1:17:19|To show that he didn't make a mistake, [Shirley Yang] beside him turned her head, saying so with her mouth, but her eyes were red, chewing gum quickly in her mouth. Her emotions were getting more and more excited, and it seemed like she was about to lose control.
1:18:32|1:19:7|[Hu Bayi] saw the compass on the ground acting strangely. [Wang Kaixuan] kicked him away, but [Hu Bayi] took the opportunity to kick back, making [Wang Kaixuan] retreat repeatedly. Suddenly, a cracking sound was heard. [Wang Kaixuan] stopped and looked down to see that he had crushed [Hu Bayi]'s compass. [Hu Bayi] watched in despair as his compass met this unfortunate fate.
1:19:7|1:19:32|Hu Bayi stood up quickly and walked forward to check the compass. He found that the compass had been broken into two pieces. He lifted his head, full of anger, and stared at Wang Kaixuan. Then he grabbed his collar. At this moment, a gunshot sounded in the distance, catching Hu Bayi's attention. He rushed to the source of the gunshot, but couldn't find Shirley Yang.
1:19:32|1:19:55|[Da Jinya] lay on the ground, unexpectedly [Ying Caihong] and her group appeared from all sides, surrounding the two. Before a word was spoken, [Wang Kaixuan] rushed out from the side.
1:19:55|1:20:11|[Hu Bayi] took the opportunity to join the battle, using his fists to knock down the enemies one by one. [Wang Kaixuan] was captured and hit by an enemy's stick on both arms. At this moment, [Hu Bayi] arrived in time, kicked the enemy, and rescued him.
1:20:11|1:20:23|[Yangzi] leaped down from the rocks with a mountaineering axe in both hands, soaring through the air to strike towards the side of [Hu Bayi]. Seeing the axe coming down, [Hu Bayi] quickly dodged to the side, and [Yangzi] smoothly changed her moves, twisting her body.
1:20:23|1:20:29|On the other hand, [Wang Kaixuan], though his arms were bound, gradually adapted. At this moment, [Hu Bayi] stood up.
1:20:29|1:20:35|[Yangzi] swung the ice axe, the two of them determined to fight again, [Yangzi] swung the axe horizontally.
1:20:35|1:20:58|[Hu Bayi] twisted his body and threw [Yangzi] to the ground. After rolling a few times and half getting up, [Yangzi] threw the axe at him. [Hu Bayi] reached out and grabbed [Yangzi]'s neck to subdue her, but unexpectedly, [Yangzi] bit his arm. Seizing the opportunity, she pulled out the dagger from [Hu Bayi]'s leg, turned around fiercely, broke free from [Hu Bayi], only to see [Wang Kaixuan] leaping high into the air and kicking towards him.
1:20:59|1:21:30|Pushing down [Yangzi] who was attacking with a knife ahead, [Ying Caihong] shouted to interrupt the fight. In her hands, [Hu Bayi], [Wang Kaixuan], and [Shirley Yang] were subdued by [Ying Caihong]'s men. Still filled with anger, [Yangzi] pulled out an axe from the rocks and ran to beat [Shirley Yang].
1:22:37|1:23:10|One of the men took out a damaged compass from [Hu Bayi]'s backpack, enraging [Ying Caihong] who brandished her sword and gun.
1:23:42|1:24:15|[Wang Kaixuan] and [Da Jinya], taking advantage of [Hu Bayi] attracting the enemy's attention, tried to cut the ropes on their bodies with rocks. Unexpectedly, many ancient artifacts fell from [Da Jinya]. Seeing the artifacts on the ground, [Wang Kaixuan] couldn't help but curse loudly.
1:24:15|1:24:32|[Da Jinya] quickly realized that he was exposed and hurriedly carried [Wang Kaixuan] to move aside.
1:24:40|1:25:6|[Wang Kaixuan] and [Da Jinya] accidentally triggered a mechanism during their fight, leading [Hu Bayi] and his team to a new underground palace.
1:25:6|1:25:22|In this scene, the rugged rocks surround a deep abyss with eerie purple mist drifting around. A suspension bridge connects to the distance, leading to the valley bottom. [Hu Bayi] and his team, holding flashlights, emerge from the passage.
1:25:41|1:25:48|[Shirley Yang] opened her mouth in astonishment,
1:25:57|1:26:9|Turning around with a sigh, he asked [Ying Caihong],
1:26:26|1:26:50|[Hu Bayi] and his team were forced by [Ying Caihong] to step onto the iron cable bridge. [Shirley Yang] took the lead, leading everyone cautiously onto the bridge. The bells on the bridge rang loudly as they walked. [Hu Bayi] shone his flashlight onto the bridge and saw patterns of the other shore flower imprinted on it. The rest of the team shone their flashlights outside the bridge, but the light was all blocked by the purple mist.
1:26:50|1:27:16|Ahead was still pitch black, not knowing when it would come to an end. [Da Jinya] felt a sense of horror at this place, and had no choice but to follow [Shirley Yang] ahead, [Shirley] held up a flashlight and walked at the front. Suddenly, she stopped in her tracks, only to see the purple mist in front gradually dissipating, revealing a circular passage.
1:27:17|1:27:33|Through the circular passage, a coffin resembling a flower bud can be seen in the distance. [Shirley Yang] and the others passed through the circular passage, stood on the stairs, and couldn't help but be amazed by the scene in front of them.
1:27:39|1:27:48|[Hu Bayi] and others strolled down the stairs and arrived at the huge circular platform where coffins were stored, exploring the dangers hidden in this place.
1:27:50|1:28:11|In the center of the circular platform, there was a huge coffin resembling a flower bud, with thick iron chains attached to it. The base was intricately carved with images of amaryllis flowers and skulls, surrounded by scattered rocks, giving it an eerie appearance. Upon arriving, Ying Caihong saw the indentation of a skull on the base of the coffin, which excited her and made her rub her hands together.
1:28:11|1:28:36|Hastily taking out the three bronze plaques collected in the underground palace, [Ying Caihong] spoke and her men threw [Hu Bayi]'s equipment in front of them. [Hu Bayi] took out a candle from the equipment, solemnly placed it in the southeast corner of the tomb chamber, and slowly lit it with a lighter.
1:28:37|1:28:41|[Hu Bayi] saw that the candle was unharmed, so he stood up and walked towards [Shirley Yang].
1:28:42|1:29:2|[Shirley Yang] took out the gold-seeking talisman from her chest and solemnly put it around her neck. Seeing this, [Hu Bayi] couldn't help but smile. [Shirley Yang] glanced at [Wang Kaixuan] beside her, who then blew on his own hair. The three of them stood in a triangular formation, extending their left hands to touch each other's fingertips.
1:29:6|1:29:10|After the three of them finished reciting the slogan, they stacked their thumbs on top of each other before finally calling it a day.
1:29:15|1:29:27|[Ying Caihong] couldn't help but show a smile when she saw the three of them. Then the three of them picked up the bronze emblems and walked towards the coffin. They stood at three different ends, surrounding the coffin in a triangular formation.
1:29:27|1:29:34|[Hu Bayi] stood in front of the skull at the base of the coffin, staring at the groove on top, his face filled with uneasiness.
1:29:35|1:29:57|[Wang Kaixuan] carefully examined the bronze emblem in his hand, while [Shirley Yang] held the touch gold talisman, looking anxious. Shortly after, the three of them stepped forward, one foot on the base of the coffin, one hand holding the bronze emblem. The three of them stood nervously in front of the coffin, causing [Ying Caihong] in the distance to become extremely anxious.
1:29:57|1:30:14|Hu Bayi nodded to the other two, Wang Kaixuan and Shirley Yang, who first placed the bronze emblem into the groove. Hu Bayi followed closely, placing his bronze emblem into the groove and slowly turning it.
1:30:15|1:30:38|The coffin suddenly made a loud noise, [Hu Bayi] couldn't help but look up at the coffin. [Hu Bayi] and the other two retreated from the base of the coffin, only to see the base slowly sinking. The bud-like coffin gradually opened as it rotated, revealing the corpse inside. The abnormal movement of the coffin made [Ying Caihong] and others unable to help but move forward to investigate, until the noise disappeared.
1:30:38|1:31:2|The coffin, resembling a flower bud, was completely opened, revealing the female corpse inside to everyone. The female corpse was dressed in a crimson silk butterfly skirt, holding a dark blue disc with blood-red patterns. Suddenly, the candle in the southeast corner flickered, changing from bright red to a ghostly green. Just as the three were about to flee, a loud noise was heard.
1:31:7|1:31:25|[Shirley Yang] tried to grab the rock wall but failed. Seeing the danger, [Hu Bayi] leaped down and caught [Shirley Yang] who was falling. Ignoring their intimate embrace, he roared and shot out the Flying Tiger Claw, then swiftly pulled out the Diamond Umbrella and stuck it into the cliff, anchoring themselves in place.
1:31:26|1:31:51|[Hu Bayi] and [Wang Kaixuan] managed to stabilize their falling bodies, but the Flying Tiger Claw dropped downwards. Using the Golden Umbrella, they were pinned to the cliff face, watching the Flying Tiger Claw plummeting below. [Hu Bayi] looked up at [Wang Kaixuan], only to see corpses scattered below. [Hu Bayi] gazed down below and muttered to himself, "..."
1:32:12|1:32:16|[Da Jinya] was hit back by [Yangzi] and directly fainted on the ground.
1:32:16|1:32:24|Seeing [Da Jinya] faint, [Ying Caihong] then propped up a ladder and stepped towards the coffin.
1:32:35|1:32:42|Not only did he quicken the pace of climbing, but it wasn't until all three of them were out of danger that [Hu Bayi] spoke up.
1:33:7|1:33:22|[Ying Caihong] sat in front of the coffin, becoming more and more excited as she spoke. At that moment, the disc in the hands of the female corpse was responding to [Ying Caihong]'s words.
1:33:30|1:33:57|The disc unexpectedly lit up with a glaring blood-red light, leaving everyone stunned in place. A towering blood-red pillar shot out from the disc, dyeing the entire underground palace in a bloody hue, appearing eerie from afar. The blood-red pillar pierced through the palace's dome, only to be absorbed by it and then burst out again. Startled by the scene before him, [Da Jinya] woke up.
1:34:3|1:34:22|Countless zombies holding swords were approaching [Da Jinya] and others. Seeing this, [Da Jinya] turned and ran. Meanwhile, [Ying Caihong] stood still, stunned. As [Ying Caihong] turned around, she saw Mark, who had long been dead.
1:34:29|1:34:44|[Ying Caihong] pulled out a gun and fired several shots at the approaching Mark, but to no avail. In desperation, [Ying Caihong] pressed a ring, and countless tiny powders flew out from the ring. Meanwhile, [Yangzi] was still locked in a fierce battle with the zombies.
1:35:10|1:35:18|[Ying Caihong] casually took off the wig on her head as she spoke, revealing the hideous scar on her head.
1:35:26|1:35:56|[Yangzi] was attracted by the abnormality of [Ying Caihong], and the monster swung its arms directly knocking [Yangzi] into the abyss. Beside the high platform, [Ying Caihong] watched [Yangzi] falling continuously with extreme sorrow in her heart. She then danced with the Kong Kong umbrella to clear the way for [Hu Bayi]. [Hu Bayi] immediately took out another Flying Tiger Claw and threw it towards the stone pillar. Standing on the stone pillar, [Hu Bayi] looked at the female corpse lying in the coffin and the disc in his hand with determination in his eyes.
1:35:56|1:36:14|[Hu Bayi] immediately pulled up the rope and swung towards the coffin, only to see numerous monsters leaping up from below, reaching out with their arms towards the disc in the hands of the female corpse. Unexpectedly, an arm extended from the disc, and the owner of the arm was the long-deceased Ding Sitian.
1:36:16|1:36:40|Upon hearing Hu Bayi's words, Ding Sitian felt a surge of strength in her heart. She tightly grabbed his arm as Hu Bayi exerted all his strength to save her. The two managed to escape just before the explosion, lying exhausted on the grass. Ding Sitian turned her head to look at Hu Bayi beside her.
1:36:47|1:37:1|Ding Sitian's face unconsciously lit up with a happy smile, and [Hu Bayi] couldn't help but hold Ding Sitian's hand. Ding Sitian shyly turned her head away, only to be captivated by a flower in front of her.
1:37:12|1:37:19|Ding Sitian reached out to pick the amaryllis flowers, but her hand was held by [Hu Bayi], who grasped Ding's hand.
1:37:22|1:37:34|Ding Sitian couldn't help but smile, and Hu Bayi was captivated by the badge on her chest, staring as if he had discovered a secret within.
1:37:40|1:38:9|[Hu Bayi] looked at the badge in front of him and Ding Sitian, feeling particularly unfamiliar. However, he noticed that Ding Sitian's smile at this moment seemed particularly eerie. Ding Sitian then stood up and walked towards the distance. [Hu Bayi] reached out his hand trying to hold Ding Sitian, but it seemed like there was an invisible wall between them, separating the two. [Hu Bayi] kept tapping on the invisible wall between them, but seeing no effect, he directly used his head to hit it.
1:38:9|1:38:36|With the sound of shattering, the space shattered as well, and [Hu Bayi] arrived in a blood-red chaotic space, where he also saw the true form of Ding Sitian, only to find it was the female corpse in the underground palace coffin. [Hu Bayi] desperately roared in the chaotic space, as soon as the female corpse finished speaking, the red-gold mask on her face dissolved, revealing Ding Sitian's face.
1:38:36|1:39:19|[Hu Bayi] calmed down instantly when he saw Ding Sitian's face. As Ding Sitian walked towards him, she spoke but received no response from [Hu Bayi]. He opened his hands and placed a round plate in the middle. However, his face was filled with a blank expression. He closed his eyes and pondered for a long time, as if making a decision in his heart. After listening to her words, [Hu Bayi] closed his eyes.
1:39:22|1:39:28|At this point, [Hu Bayi]'s eyes were red, tears already covering his face.
1:39:38|1:40:5|[Hu Bayi] quickly grabbed the disc in front of him, narrowly snatching it from the hands of the female corpse, and safely returned to his position using a rope. [Hu Bayi] steadied himself, raised his arm,
1:40:34|1:40:45|[Wang Kaixuan] listened to Xiaoding's words and conscientiously handed the round plate to Xiaoding. When [Wang Kaixuan] looked up, he found the plate in the hands of [Hu Bayi], and Xiaoding was nowhere to be seen.
1:40:45|1:40:53|Hu Bayi pondered for a long time before explaining the truth to Wang Kaixuan.
1:41:3|1:41:12|[Hu Bayi] spoke with tears in his eyes, tightly gripping the disc in his hands, and fiercely throwing it towards the base of the distant coffin.
1:41:12|1:41:22|The disc was slowly flying in the air, but then it was bounced off the base. Suddenly, it slowly cracked open from the center, leaving [Wang Kaixuan] stunned on the side.
1:41:27|1:41:44|As the cracking sound intensified, the cracks on the disc grew larger. At this moment, [Shirley Yang] was pinned to the wall by a monster, but suddenly exploded into powder, freeing [Shirley Yang]. The monsters attacking [Da Jinya] also exploded into powder.
1:41:44|1:41:50|Countless monsters around also turned into dust and disappeared as the disc was damaged.
1:41:51|1:42:20|Suddenly, the disc emitted a powerful suction force, transforming into a miniature black hole that swallowed up all the flying debris around it. As the debris was consumed, the disc could no longer hold together and shattered apart. [Hu Bayi] gazed at the shattered disc pieces, tears swirling in his eyes. The group watched the fragments of the disc, feeling a sense of unease in their hearts.
1:42:23|1:42:33|[Wang Kaixuan] shed tears directly, crying very sadly. At this moment, what did [Hu Bayi] seem to see? He hurried over.
1:42:36|1:42:58|Facing Shirley Yang's call, Da Jinya did not respond. At this moment, Hu Bayi quickened his pace and walked up to Shirley Yang, reaching out his hands to embrace her. Beside the coffin, Ying Caihong frantically picked up the broken pieces of the plate.
1:43:15|1:43:40|Accidentally, the newly found disc fragment was hung over the abyss. [Ying Caihong] possessed to reach for it, but ended up falling down herself. As the underground palace was about to collapse, countless stones fell from the dome and smashed towards the fleeing crowd, with [Wang Kaixuan] urging [Da Jinya] ahead.
1:43:41|1:43:50|As soon as they stepped onto the iron chain bridge, rocks fell and smashed the coffin, causing the broken bridge to rapidly slide and slam heavily against the cliff.
1:43:51|1:43:58|[Hu Bayi] and the others quickly stabilized their bodies and continued to climb upwards, as more and more rocks fell from the underground palace.
1:44:0|1:44:8|Seeing the situation was critical, [Hu Bayi] quickly called everyone to jump down. Several people immediately responded to [Hu Bayi]'s call and leaped down.
1:44:10|1:44:19|The group fell into the newly formed pool of water along with the falling rocks.
1:44:25|1:44:37|At this moment, Hu Bayi is singing folk songs by the lake on the grassland. He reaches into the lake, picks up a stone, and throws it vigorously towards the center of the lake. The stone spins rapidly on the surface of the lake, hitting four water floats before disappearing.
1:44:38|1:44:54|The originally calm lake surface suddenly produced a huge vortex, causing Hu Bayi to be greatly shocked. The vortex became more turbulent, and the hole formed under the vortex seemed bottomless, as if directly connected to the core of the earth, it seemed to be about to swallow the entire lake.
1:44:58|1:45:10|Aji hurried back home in a panic, unaware that it was Hu Bayi and his team at the bottom of the lake, the flowing water on the dome still continuing. Hu Bayi and the others still couldn't find a way out, while Da Jinya frantically thrashed his body next to Wang Kaixuan.
1:45:25|1:45:39|[Hu Bayi] and his team rowed towards the distant coffin. [Shirley Yang] inserted the diamond umbrella under the coffin lid, exerted all her strength to pry it open. [Wang Kaixuan] also successfully pried open the coffin lid and threw out the corpse inside.
1:45:42|1:46:3|Hu Bayi then turned and swam towards Shirley Yang. Seeing Hu Bayi approaching, Shirley Yang quickly reached out and pulled him into the coffin. At this moment, the surrounding rock walls could not withstand the immense water pressure and shattered, allowing water to rush in. Hu Bayi and the others quickly closed the coffin lid, and the coffin drifted around in the water.
1:46:16|1:46:25|A mouthful bit into Wang Kaixuan's arm, the coffin swayed incessantly with the water flow, making Hu Bayi and Shirley Yang hiding inside extremely uncomfortable.
1:46:25|1:46:54|After a long time, the coffin carrying [Hu Bayi] and [Shirley Yang] suddenly emerged from the water, no longer swaying. The two hidden inside seemed to sense something, as [Hu Bayi] lightly tapped the coffin as if they had reached the surface. [Hu Bayi] and [Shirley Yang] struggled to push open the coffin lid, only to find the familiar dome above their heads. They did not escape with the current. [Hu Bayi] looked at the stone wall above.
1:46:55|1:47:5|With faces full of disappointment, [Hu Bayi] and [Shirley Yang] sat dejectedly on the coffin, looking around.
1:47:13|1:47:42|[Hu Bayi], faced with such a dangerous situation, actually smiled and turned to look at [Shirley Yang]. Seeing this, [Shirley Yang] couldn't help but walk up and hug the dejected [Hu Bayi]. Upon hearing this, [Hu Bayi] couldn't help but feel sorrowful, holding [Shirley Yang] tighter with both hands.
1:47:42|1:48:3|For a long time, the two separated, [Hu Bayi] smiled as he looked at [Shirley Yang] in front of him, still tightly holding [Shirley Yang]'s hands. [Shirley Yang] smiled and shook her head at [Hu Bayi], who gazed affectionately at her, reaching out to touch her hair and face.
1:48:3|1:48:12|The two of them looked at each other, and suddenly he grabbed [Shirley Yang]'s hands and tied them up.
1:48:13|1:48:21|[Hu Bayi] pulled out the diamond umbrella and stuffed [Shirley Yang] into the coffin.
1:48:36|1:49:14|[Hu Bayi] waved the vajra umbrella and smashed the stone wall above his head, causing water to flow out. As [Shirley Yang] encouraged him, [Hu Bayi] became more vigorous in his chiseling. With [Hu Bayi]'s movements, the water instantly broke through the stone wall, and he was directly washed into the water. [Hu Bayi] floated aimlessly with the water flow, being ruthlessly battered by the scattered coffins around him.
1:49:14|1:49:18|But as the water flowed deeper and deeper, their figures gradually disappeared.
1:49:18|1:49:38|On the other hand, [Shirley Yang] was swaying in the coffin but not in any danger. The coffin gradually floated to the surface of the water. The calm lake suddenly revealed a coffin, and [Wang Kaixuan] struggled to open it from the inside, finally escaping from the underground palace. [Wang Kaixuan] could hardly bear the sight of [Da Jinya].
1:49:48|1:49:58|He knocked him out directly, and another coffin appeared next to [Wang Kaixuan]. [Wang Kaixuan] pulled the coffin closer and knocked on it a few times.
1:50:5|1:50:38|It was not the coffin that [Hu Bayi] was riding in. At this moment, a noise caught the attention of [Wang Kaixuan]. He turned around and saw a new coffin. [Wang Kaixuan] focused his gaze and found [Hu Bayi]'s Flying Tiger Claw tied to the coffin. With a big laugh, [Wang Kaixuan] opened the coffin in front of him, only to find [Shirley Yang] lying inside, with no trace of [Hu Bayi]. This discovery excited [Wang Kaixuan].
1:50:40|1:50:53|Faced with the inquiry from [Wang Kaixuan], [Shirley Yang] did not answer him. Upon hearing [Wang Kaixuan]'s words, [Shirley Yang], curled up in the coffin, cried even more sorrowfully. Seeing [Shirley Yang]'s expression, [Wang Kaixuan] couldn't help but guess what was going on.
1:50:53|1:50:56|The expression immediately turned sad.
1:50:57|1:51:30|[Wang Kaixuan] stood up, his emotions particularly agitated. As soon as [Wang Kaixuan] finished speaking, he leaped into the water, trying to search for [Hu Bayi]'s whereabouts, leaving behind [Shirley Yang] who was crying uncontrollably in the coffin and [Da Jinya] who was unconscious. After a while, there was a strange sound on the water surface. At this moment, [Shirley Yang] was not paying attention, but suddenly a figure swam towards the coffin and patted the crying [Shirley Yang].
1:51:32|1:51:49|[Shirley Yang] widened her eyes and watched as [Hu Bayi] with water plants hanging in front of him, couldn't help but slap him on the ear. [Shirley Yang] spoke,
1:51:58|1:52:8|[Wang Kaixuan] suddenly emerged from the water, looking extremely agitated.
1:52:32|1:52:46|[Hu Bayi] lightly brushed [Shirley Yang]'s ear with his hand, suddenly producing a ring, holding it between his fingers, and placing it in front of [Shirley Yang].
1:53:11|1:53:40|Da Jinya was pushed into the water by [Shirley Yang]. He thrashed about wildly in the water. [Shirley Yang] handed the ring she had taken from Da Jinya to [Hu Bayi], then gestured for him to put it on her finger. However, [Hu Bayi] hesitated at this moment, with a look of indignation on his face, gazing at [Shirley Yang]. He then put the ring on [Shirley Yang]'s hand and bent down to kiss her palm.
1:53:41|1:53:49|[Wang Kaixuan] is very disgusted by [Hu Bayi]'s show of affection, while Da Jinya floats on the water with a look of confusion on his face.
