0:1:58|0:2:3|On the way home, [Liang Xia] was confessed to by [Mao Liang], who had secretly admired her for a long time.
0:2:3|0:2:11|Amidst the cheers of the crowd, [Liang Xia] finally agreed to be his girlfriend, and the two entered into a passionate relationship, inseparable every day.
0:2:12|0:2:23|[Liang Xia] changed her usual style to make sure [Mao Liang]'s love for her doesn't expire. She dressed up exquisitely and avoided her favorite snacks, locking them all in a safe.
0:2:23|0:2:38|As time went by, [Mao Liang]'s career soared, and the busyness and pressure suddenly came without warning. The smooth and relaxed pace was abruptly cut off, and the obstacles of work came one after another. He was immersed in work every day, with no time to take care of [Liang Xia].
0:2:39|0:2:48|And at this moment, [Liang Xia] has already been consumed by emotions, sharpened by life, worn down by time to the point of giving up, and lost her ideals in the current situation.
0:2:48|0:2:59|She overly relies on [Mao Liang], losing herself and her original way of life, filled with fantasies of a happy life with [Mao Liang], eagerly anticipating walking hand in hand with him into the realm of marriage.
0:2:59|0:3:7|At this moment, a figure in a white dress catches the eye, with a slender waist, tall figure, and two long and fair arms exposed, pulling up the zipper behind.
0:3:8|0:3:14|After he finished adjusting his outfit, he casually picked up the lipstick on the table and applied it to his sexy lips.
0:3:14|0:3:23|Following that, he opened the perfume next to him, sprayed it on his wrist, then lifted his wrist to his nose, closed his eyes, and savored this unique charm.
0:3:23|0:3:30|He looked at the satisfactory number on the electronic scale, walked towards the mirror with light steps, and enjoyed it alone.
0:3:39|0:3:51|At that moment, a hand reached for the alarm clock and turned off the noisy sound, while [Liang Xia] stood by the pool, carefully rubbing the orange in her hand, and then cut the orange into several small pieces.
0:3:51|0:3:59|[Mao Liang] immediately got up, walked out of the bedroom, and looked at the tablet in his hand while walking. The tablet was playing the latest news of the day.
0:3:59|0:4:6|In the kitchen on the other side, [Liang Xia] was busy alone, preparing breakfast for them. The eggs were spread out in heart-shaped molds, sizzling non-stop.
0:4:12|0:4:25|After taking a shower, [Mao Liang] stretched lazily on the balcony. Then he walked into the closet, carefully selecting his clothes. The simple black shirt accentuated his tall figure, as he glanced at the prepared breakfast on the table.
0:4:33|0:4:37|[Liang Xia] shyly lowered her head and turned around to put the breakfast on the dining table.
0:4:37|0:4:43|Suddenly, [Mao Liang] was attracted by the voice from the tablet, turned around and picked up the tablet, walking towards the dining table.
0:4:43|0:4:47|The two sit facing each other, with [Liang Xia] propping up her chin with one hand, gazing affectionately at [Mao Liang].
0:4:51|0:4:55|[Mao Liang] looked at [Liang Xia] with a puzzled expression, then continued to eat breakfast.
0:4:55|0:5:10|Liang Xia couldn't contain her curiosity and immediately stood up, taking out a box with diamonds from his suit pocket, eagerly awaiting his response.
0:5:10|0:5:14|[Liang Xia] looked at him with a sense of loss, while he continued to speak absentmindedly.
0:5:21|0:5:29|[Liang Xia] slowly placed the box in the middle of the dining table, but in her mind, all she could see was the moment when [Mao Liang] confessed his feelings to her.
0:5:43|0:5:49|At this moment, [Liang Xia] sat in her original position, staring blankly at the table, while continuously nibbling on the bread in her hand.
0:5:49|0:5:54|Suddenly, the balloons on the door frame burst open, and the ribbons inside floated down.
0:5:54|0:6:0|Before long, [Liang Xia] rushed into the cloakroom, pushed aside the hanging clothes, and moved the safe out from inside.
0:6:0|0:6:10|Watching the sealed safe, he sighed deeply, tore off the seal, took out the key to open the safe, and took out all the snacks inside, placing them in the living room.
0:6:10|0:6:17|Later, he half lay in the middle of the sofa, stuffing snacks into his mouth, staring blankly at the TV.
0:6:17|0:6:19|Suddenly, the TV screen malfunctioned, displaying a distorted image.
0:7:9|0:7:17|[Liang Xia] successfully ordered magic chocolate, and the senior sister in the movie is 28 years old but still a minor, gradually unfolding under the influence of colors.
0:7:17|0:7:24|On the other side, Liang Xia, dressed in gorgeous attire, tightly closed her eyes, shaking the tortoiseshell in her hand, with the copper coins rolling inside incessantly.
0:7:24|0:7:36|Before long, she emptied all the copper coins and began counting on her fingers while chanting a spell.
0:7:36|0:7:39|Before [Liang Xia] could react, her best friend took out an ancient book.
0:8:12|0:8:14|Listening to what my best friend said.
0:8:14|0:8:16|[Liang Xia] was relieved but melancholy as she spoke.
0:8:29|0:8:33|The next day quickly arrived, and the guests arrived as scheduled, driving into the villa one by one.
0:8:33|0:8:41|And at this moment, [Liang Xia] was also in the convoy. Just as he was driving, suddenly a figure blocked his car.
0:8:41|0:8:50|[Liang Xia] stared in astonishment at the front, as the host gestured playfully. Then he walked to the window of the driver's seat and signaled for [Liang Xia] to roll down the window.
0:8:56|0:9:5|Liang Xia looked at him in disbelief as the gift box was handed to her, taking it and holding it close to inspect.
0:9:6|0:9:15|In short, he gestured with a smile, and when [Liang Xia] looked up, he had already disappeared.
0:9:15|0:9:18|[Liang Xia] looked around, trying to find his figure.
0:9:18|0:9:24|Following that, he tore open the outer packaging, opened the box, and each chocolate was individually wrapped and displayed in the gift box.
0:9:28|0:9:36|Let's congratulate the newlyweds Liang Xia and Mao Liang today, but they both look towards the empty seat in the audience.
0:9:36|0:9:43|Our groom has prepared a surprise for the bride.
0:9:43|0:9:49|Later, the groom took out a pure gold turtle shell encrusted with diamonds from the box presented by the best man.
0:9:49|0:9:51|The bride looked excitedly at the turtle shell and covered her mouth.
0:9:53|0:9:56|The groom expresses his love to the bride affectionately.
0:9:56|0:9:59|They then happily embraced and kissed each other.
0:9:59|0:10:1|[Liang Xia] stood behind the bride, deeply moved.
0:10:1|0:10:5|Seeing her best friend so happy, [Liang Xia] raised her hands and applauded for her.
0:10:5|0:10:11|Just then, [Mao Liang] quietly walked in, catching [Liang Xia]'s attention at once.
0:10:11|0:10:14|[Mao Liang] awkwardly made his way through the crowd towards his seat.
0:10:26|0:10:28|Under the bright spotlight, [Liang Xia] felt a wave of joy in her heart.
0:10:36|0:10:39|Just as he sat down, [Mao Liang] quickly stood up and walked towards the stage.
0:11:4|0:11:11|At this moment, it felt like the two of them were transported back to ten years ago, when [Mao Liang] confessed his feelings to [Liang Xia].
0:11:51|0:11:59|[Liang Xia] looked at [Mao Liang] expectantly, while [Mao Liang] forced a smile and then took the microphone.
0:12:7|0:12:14|After listening for a moment, the smile on his face disappeared instantly. He stared at [Liang Xia] seriously, but received no response.
0:12:14|0:12:17|[Mao Liang] lowered his head guiltily, not daring to look into his eyes.
0:12:17|0:12:25|Just then, [Mao Liang]'s phone suddenly rang, and he quickly took it out to check the incoming call display.
0:12:25|0:12:27|After speaking, he turned around and walked away while making a phone call.
0:12:30|0:12:38|At this moment, [Liang Xia] looked around in confusion, while his best friend looked at him with a heart full of pity. Then [Liang Xia] immediately put on his coat and chased after.
0:12:38|0:12:46|[Mao Liang] watched as the car drove past him, he stomped his feet in frustration, then ran towards his own car and quickly got in, immediately catching up.
0:12:46|0:12:55|Before long, he caught up with [Mao Liang], but despite being within arm's reach, he couldn't get [Mao Liang] to stop. So he called [Mao Liang], only to hear something unexpected on the other end of the line.
0:12:58|0:13:1|Seeing that [Mao Liang] didn't answer the phone, he anxiously redialed.
0:13:1|0:13:8|The phone kept vibrating, at this moment, [Mao Liang]'s car kept accelerating to overtake the cars in front, relentlessly chasing from behind.
0:13:8|0:13:13|Suddenly, the car in front tried to overtake, causing [Liang Xia] to slam on the brakes and honk the horn frantically.
0:13:13|0:13:17|After the car in front swerved away, he chased after it and scattered the chocolates along the way.
0:13:31|0:13:40|At this moment, [Mao Liang]'s car drove through the intersection, while [Liang Xia] was stopped by the red light. She watched the back of [Mao Liang]'s car, feeling a mix of emotions in her heart.
0:13:40|0:13:44|This time Mao Liang was completely disappointed, but Liang Xia just wanted a resolution with him.
0:13:44|0:13:53|As Liang Xia stared blankly ahead, rain started to fall from the sky, with a cold raindrop hitting the car window first.
0:13:53|0:14:0|The rain intensified suddenly, pouring down from the sky with rhythmic beats on the car body like a canopy.
0:14:0|0:14:6|In the car, [Liang Xia] could no longer hide the fragility in her heart, and burst into tears, feeling like the whole world was abandoning her.
0:14:6|0:14:10|In a panic, she looked around trying to find a shred of comfort.
0:14:10|0:14:15|Suddenly, she noticed the magic chocolate placed on the passenger seat and immediately grabbed one and stuffed it into her mouth.
0:14:16|0:14:34|He covered his mouth and cried uncontrollably, as a clap of thunder sounded in the overcast sky. Then a bolt of lightning streaked across the sky, and at that moment, the red light turned green. [Liang Xia] stopped crying under the urging of the person in the back seat, driving forward with a vacant look, the windshield wipers dutifully doing their job.
0:14:34|0:14:43|Again and again, [Liang Xia] wiped the rain off the windshield, but no one helped him wipe away his tears. Just then, the rain on the windshield miraculously flowed back.
0:14:44|0:14:50|The scene goes back to the eyes of [Liang Xia], where numerous nerve fibers emit a strange light.
0:14:50|0:14:54|Before long, the scene cuts back to [Liang Xia] sitting in the car.
0:14:54|0:14:59|She blinked her eyes, but didn't notice the turn signal of the vehicle in front, and crashed into it.
0:14:59|0:15:5|She slowly looked up ahead, everything in front of her appeared blurry, even the car opposite seemed to have double images.
0:15:6|0:15:15|Just as [Liang Xia] was feeling dizzy, the driver who hit her had already gotten out of the car and stood by the window, frantically banging on it and shouting for [Liang Xia] to come down.
0:15:15|0:15:21|[Liang Xia] looked at him in confusion, but could never see his face clearly. She had no choice but to open the car door and get out.
0:15:21|0:15:27|He stood by the car, still unable to hear what the driver was saying, but feeling that the sun was particularly dazzling today.
0:15:27|0:15:32|He squinted at the sun, but everything around him seemed incredibly unfamiliar. 
0:15:32|0:15:38|Turning his head to look at the car, Liang Xia unexpectedly caught a glimpse of his reflection on the car window.
0:15:38|0:15:41|He bent down in shock, carefully observing. 
0:15:41|0:15:50|Looking at this face that was both familiar and unfamiliar to him, suddenly, the driver beside him gave him a push, followed by saying.
0:15:50|0:15:53|[Liang Xia] turned her head to look at him with an innocent expression.
0:16:0|0:16:16|After speaking, the driver who was hit took out his phone and made a call, while [Liang Xia] continued to admire herself, playing with her earrings nonchalantly.
0:16:16|0:16:18|Upon hearing this, [Liang Xia] turned around and ran.
0:16:23|0:16:31|He ran away amidst curses, holding up his skirt as he ran. After finally passing through the vehicles, he found himself lost when he looked back.
0:16:31|0:16:37|He stood on the roadside, bending over and panting heavily, unexpectedly seeing on the screen across the street that the time for the European Cup was 2016.
0:16:50|0:17:12|Suddenly, the phone in [Liang Xia]'s pocket rang. She took out her phone and saw that it was a call from her best friend [Bai Xiaoning]. A smile appeared on her face, but she couldn't answer the call no matter what she tried. She anxiously searched for a way to connect the call.
0:17:41|0:17:52|The best friend covered her mouth in shock, then pinched [Liang Xia]'s face and looked at it from left to right. Recalling everything that had just happened, the best friend confidently said to [Liang Xia],
0:18:18|0:18:25|She opened her arms, imagining herself standing under the spotlight, while her best friend bit her finger and turned her head to the side.
0:18:48|0:18:51|Liang Xia looked at her best friend with a face full of grievances.
0:18:51|0:18:54|He furrowed his brow, unable to believe what he was hearing, and said,
0:19:17|0:19:21|The best friend kept shaking her head.
0:19:21|0:19:26|Liang Xia spread out her left hand and pointed with her fingers to the photo hanging on the wall.
0:19:26|0:19:32|[Liang Xia] sat at the head of the bed, but her hands were tapping on the tablet.
0:19:32|0:19:37|Startled, [Liang Xia] immediately withdrew her hand and looked at the tablet in confusion, while her best friend taught her how to use it.
0:19:46|0:19:51|Later, she brought the tablet to her chest, and her best friend then pulled her hand to place it on the start button.
0:20:1|0:20:7|Following that, [Liang Xia] took off her evening gown, changed into casual clothes, and combed her hair in front of the mirror.
0:20:7|0:20:15|Liang Xia, with her eyes covered, slowly turned around while leaning against the wall.
0:20:15|0:20:17|She picked up her tablet and backpack and walked away.
0:20:31|0:20:37|When the two of them were having a good time, [Mao Liang] opened the door and walked in, causing [Liang Xia] to slowly turn around with a smile.
0:20:37|0:20:41|Later, the two of them decided to have a good chat.
0:20:41|0:20:44|[Liang Xia] sat cross-legged across from [Mao Liang], watching him.
0:21:4|0:21:7|[Mao Liang] was a bit at a loss during the interview.
0:21:29|0:21:36|After speaking, [Liang Xia] stood up, with both hands resting on the table.
0:21:36|0:21:41|She then turned around and grabbed her bag before leaving.
0:21:41|0:21:48|[Mao Liang] furrowed his brows and looked in the direction where [Liang Xia] was leaving. Just then, her phone rang.
0:21:48|0:21:52|On the other side, Liang Xia, sitting in the taxi, was admiring the scenery along the road while combing her hair.
0:22:23|0:22:25|[Liang Xia] immediately turned to look at her best friend.
0:22:32|0:22:41|The strong classical music rendered the crowd, the entire venue shimmering with neon lights, people in different costumes standing in the dance floor, swaying their bodies to the music.
0:22:52|0:22:58|She then stood in front of the crowd, dancing non-stop to the music, and even inviting others to join in with her hands.
0:22:58|0:23:3|Soon, everyone else was drawn to her dance and involuntarily started moving along.
0:23:3|0:23:5|The best friend stood shyly on the side, feeling love-struck.
0:23:5|0:23:9|Before long, he joined in the dance with [Liang Xia].
0:23:9|0:23:15|The two mesmerizing dancers kept influencing the people around them, who were all learning the dance of Liang Xia and her best friend.
0:23:15|0:23:21|Before long, a small group of people learned to stand behind [Liang Xia] and move their bodies in dance.
0:23:21|0:23:29|And at this moment, [Liang Xia] was getting more and more excited as he danced, infecting everyone around him. He never expected that he would inspire so many people to dance to their club song together.
0:23:29|0:23:32|Soon, everyone present mastered the dance.
0:23:35|0:23:41|They followed the music and danced non-stop in the dance floor, although each of them was dressed in a unique outfit, they danced in perfect harmony.
0:23:43|0:23:56|At this moment, with the dynamic rhythm, Liang Xia and Mao Liang are dancing with light and brisk steps, blooming with brilliant smiles, exuding the vitality of youth all over, showcasing the beauty in sports, and experiencing the joy brought by dancing.
0:23:56|0:24:6|At 17, she is carefree and unconcerned about what others think of her, living the way she wants to be. With her guidance, her best friend also begins to break free and be themselves.
0:24:6|0:24:11|The two of them seemed to have returned to their youth, behaving recklessly and fearlessly. 
0:24:11|0:24:21|After the music ended, [Liang Xia] excitedly looked up and shouted towards the sky. Everyone present raised their hands and applauded for him, and he excitedly high-fived the people next to him.
0:24:21|0:24:32|On the other side, [Mao Liang] was constantly searching for something in the office, with his female colleague helping him look for it.
0:24:32|0:24:43|[Mao Liang] stood with hands on hips, furrowing his brows and sighing, while [Liang Xia] and her friends were enjoying themselves with drinks when suddenly her phone rang.
0:24:43|0:24:47|After hanging up the phone, [Mao Liang] inadvertently saw [Liang Xia]'s moments on social media.
0:24:47|0:25:4|In each photo, [Liang Xia] is pictured with newly made friends. She angrily shuts off her phone and throws it onto the nearby table.
0:25:4|0:25:6|[Liang Xia] took out a tablet from her bag and placed it in front of her chest.
0:25:12|0:25:19|Suddenly, the tablet was snatched by the blond man, and [Liang Xia] not only did not get angry, but was even happier.
0:25:19|0:25:29|Just after venting, [Liang Xia] became listless, with illusions appearing before her eyes. She stared blankly at the flickering lights above her head, with a buzzing sound in her ears.
0:25:29|0:25:32|Just then, her best friend suddenly appeared behind her.
0:25:45|0:25:57|[Liang Xia] looked around with a confused expression, and then her best friend started vomiting uncontrollably.
0:25:57|0:26:2|At this moment, [Liang Xia] looked even more puzzled, while her best friend realized belatedly.
0:26:2|0:26:8|She looked up, carefully observing Liang Xia, and pinched her face, saying.
0:26:21|0:26:25|The best friends danced and gestured to describe the battle.
0:26:43|0:26:50|Just then, Liang Xia's phone rang.
0:26:50|0:26:57|[Liang Xia] nervously answered the phone and put it to her ear.
0:27:6|0:27:10|Following that, [Liang Xia] emptied the contents of her bag onto the ground and searched frantically.
0:27:17|0:27:21|Liang Xia looked at her best friend in confusion, then walked towards her.
0:27:43|0:27:49|Confused by her best friend's words, the problem-solving Liang Xia was at a loss.
0:27:49|0:27:54|At this moment, the two of them sat in the taxi, with [Liang Xia] wearily shaking her head.
0:28:13|0:28:19|The driver grabbed [Liang Xia] and her best friend reluctantly argued with him, but he still took away a few of them.
0:28:19|0:28:28|In order to ensure the happiness of [Liang Xia], her best friend went all out, causing the taxi to urgently brake back and forth at the intersection, making the two people in the car lurch forward due to inertia.
0:28:28|0:28:33|After multiple experiments that left the two exhausted, [Bai Xiaoning] immediately propped up her chin when the car stopped.
0:28:46|0:28:56|A BMW car came speeding in, and it came to a steady stop right in front of the taxi.
0:28:56|0:29:1|[Bai Xiaoning] used a sweet tactic on her husband, and the two of them nodded vigorously.
0:29:6|0:29:9|The driver glanced at the money in her hand, then looked at the BMW in front of them.
0:29:21|0:29:27|Before the driver could count the money happily, a police car quickly stopped between the two cars.
0:29:51|0:29:57|The female police officer opened the door, and [Mao Liang] walked slowly into the interrogation room, looking helplessly at [Liang Xia].
0:29:57|0:30:2|[Liang Xia] lowered her head in embarrassment, her eyes turning red in an instant. The interrogating police officer, seeing this, stood up and left.
0:30:3|0:30:9|The police walked up to [Mao Liang] and gave him a special reminder. Seeing this, [Bai Xiaoning] also got up and left.
0:30:18|0:30:26|[Liang Xia] lowered her head, tears swirling in her eyes, then [Mao Liang] handed her a paper bag, and [Liang Xia] took what he had in his hand.
0:30:34|0:30:46|[Liang Xia] looked bewilderedly to the side, then reached into the bag in his arms and took out a chocolate from the box. He unwrapped it and put it into his mouth, chewing with a vacant stare.
0:30:49|0:30:56|At this moment, [Liang Xia]'s hand was trembling next to her mouth, her brows furrowed, and her eyelashes dampened by tears.
0:30:56|0:31:1|She almost collapsed emotionally and hugged [Mao Liang], afraid that he would leave in the next second.
0:31:1|0:31:3|[Mao Liang] patiently comforted her.
0:31:22|0:31:31|[Mao Liang] kept stroking his head to comfort [Liang Xia], who was still immersed in sadness, completely unaware that his body was quietly undergoing changes.
0:31:31|0:31:36|Tears struggled to well up in the eyes, flowing uncontrollably.
0:31:36|0:31:41|Suddenly, he opened his eyes and felt himself being held, then he pushed [Mao Liang] away.
0:31:46|0:31:57|After speaking, he walked towards the door and bumped [Mao Liang] hard on the way, before [Mao Liang] could react, his phone rang.
0:32:3|0:32:14|Shortly after, he turned and walked away with a smile. Enraged, [Mao Liang] immediately followed, while the friend hiding outside the door looked shocked at where [Liang Xia] had disappeared. Then, he walked straight into the interrogation room.
0:32:16|0:32:25|[Mao Liang] is searching for the tablet based on the positioning.
0:32:25|0:32:29|[Mao Liang] followed the navigation and, with one misstep, fell straight down.
0:32:29|0:32:35|He continued searching, but ended up in a pile of garbage, looking back at his phone in disbelief.
0:32:35|0:32:37|He looked up and saw the bag next to the beggar.
0:32:49|0:32:59|[Mao Liang] cleverly hides behind a tree to escape danger, then he empties his bag and carefully searches through everything.
0:32:59|0:33:7|He continued to search along the navigation, only to see [Mao Liang] vigorously chopping meat.
0:33:51|0:33:58|[Mao Liang] handed the money directly to the boss, afraid that he might regret it. But the boss took the money, deftly picked up a knife, and smashed the tablet with the handle.
0:34:1|0:34:7|The boss threw the tablet into [Mao Liang]'s arms. He carefully opened the tablet and stood there at a loss.
0:34:7|0:34:17|On the other side, [Liang Xia] with delicate makeup and a concise short hair, wearing a leopard print sweater coat and a studded collar, sat on the subway curiously looking around.
0:34:17|0:34:22|The young man next to him was playing with his phone. He quickly moved closer, but was rejected. He then smiled to himself.
0:34:22|0:34:25|As he looked around, two men walked onto the subway.
0:34:26|0:34:31|She caught a glimpse of the profile of one of the men with the corner of her eye, unexpectedly captivated.
0:34:31|0:34:37|Seeing the man turn his head, she immediately averted her gaze, shrinking in her chair and stealing glances.
0:34:37|0:34:48|17-year-old [Mao Liang] is experiencing her first crush, the face of the young man lingering in her mind. Determined to capture this moment, she takes out her makeup bag and sketchbook from her backpack.
0:34:48|0:34:53|After getting ready, Liang Xia secretly glanced at the man, memorizing his silhouette in her heart and sketching it in her notebook.
0:34:54|0:35:0|He sketched simply, with smooth strokes, and quickly, the outline of the man appeared on the paper.
0:35:0|0:35:9|Continuing, he applied eyeshadow to add color, but as he tried to observe further, he met her gaze, causing him to awkwardly bury his head in the sketchbook.
0:35:10|0:35:29|The man saw her looking shy, unconsciously smiling, eyes avoiding contact, trying hard to disguise his emotions. But her little actions had already been seen through by the companion beside her, who, unsurprised, shook his head helplessly. At this moment, [Liang Xia] pushed aside her bangs, glanced at her sideways, and the man also noticed [Mao Liang] looking at him from the corner of his eye.
0:35:29|0:35:43|Shyly turning her head to the other side, [Liang Xia] covered her mouth to control her emotions and continued painting. When she looked up again, the man was actually smiling happily, and [Liang Xia] responded with a smile as well.
0:35:43|0:35:48|At this moment, [Liang Xia] felt a dizzy spell in her head and immediately closed her eyes to ease it.
0:35:48|0:35:54|However, the man's companion took out a phone to snap photos of her, prompting the man to immediately reach out to intercept.
0:35:54|0:35:59|Liang Xia slowly opened her eyes, looking at the unfamiliar surroundings, feeling nervous.
0:36:0|0:36:6|Suddenly, he noticed his short hair in the mirror opposite, touching it in shock.
0:36:6|0:36:10|At this moment, the man noticed his unusual behavior and furrowed his brows to observe him.
0:36:10|0:36:17|After noticing the strange looks, Liang Xia took off the wig and chose to leave, with the sketchbook slipping off her lap onto the ground.
0:36:17|0:36:22|As he passed by the man, he was unexpectedly stopped. The man hinted at him, but he ignored and walked past.
0:36:22|0:36:40|On the side, Liang Xia's companion quickly picked up the fallen notebook and threw it to the man, but he was still too late. The subway doors closed abruptly. Wanting to call out to him, but not knowing his name, Liang Xia could only lean against the window and watch his departing figure. He looked disappointedly at his companion, then lowered his head and opened the notebook.
0:36:40|0:36:50|Inside is a complete portrait, with Liang Xia using colors to depict his dark side, making the whole picture more three-dimensional. He looks at the painting, and can't help but smile.
0:36:56|0:37:1|In the company, the superior was flipping through the design drawings on the broken tablet, with [Mao Liang] standing beside him with a dejected look.
0:37:3|0:37:4|After speaking, he took out his phone and started searching.
0:37:40|0:37:45|[Mao Liang] took the phone and scrolled through Weibo, unexpectedly coming across a photo of [Liang Xia], which made his eyes widen.
0:38:0|0:38:21|Mr. Gao retracted his hand and smiled at [Mao Liang], while at this moment, [Mao Liang] stood still in confusion.
0:38:21|0:38:28|When she walked into the interrogation room, the floor was a mess. She picked up a piece of chocolate wrapper from the ground and sniffed it in front of her nose.
0:38:49|0:38:57|Liang Xia looked at the chocolate in her best friend's hand with reluctance as her best friend spread her hands out on the table.
0:39:2|0:39:8|At this moment, Liang Xia's phone rang, and the caller ID made her instantly nervous.
0:39:11|0:39:17|In the restaurant, [Liang Xia] is fixing her stray hair with a makeup mirror, then she adjusts her earring and occasionally looks towards the door.
0:39:17|0:39:26|Not long after, [Mao Liang] slowly walked towards her. [Liang Xia] put away her makeup mirror, looked up and smiled, and [Mao Liang] greeted her without any grudges.
0:39:38|0:39:53|The two of them sat down one after another, but [Liang Xia] sitting across from them seemed restless, with her eyes wandering aimlessly.
0:39:53|0:39:56|[Mao Liang] immediately pulled up Weibo and placed the phone in front of [Liang Xia].
0:40:0|0:40:4|[Liang Xia] smiled awkwardly after seeing the content.
0:40:4|0:40:8|Afterwards, [Mao Liang], who was staring at him intently, opened the second photo.
0:40:8|0:40:13|At this moment, [Liang Xia] felt a chill in her heart and placed her phone upside down on the table.
0:40:13|0:40:16|He then buried his head in his arms and let out a deep sigh.
0:40:16|0:40:20|[Mao Liang] saw him so hesitant, and disappointedly spoke.
0:40:28|0:40:37|After speaking, [Mao Liang] prepared to eat, while [Liang Xia] lowered her head in silence, and the assistant then took out a document from the bag.
0:40:37|0:40:43|[Mao Liang] took the phone and started browsing, while at this moment, [Liang Xia]'s arm leaned on the table observing the two of them.
0:40:50|0:41:5|The assistant looked at [Mao Liang] expectantly, while [Liang Xia] knocked over the vinegar jar. He grabbed a handful of dried fruits from the plate and stuffed them into his mouth, feeling very wronged.
0:41:13|0:41:26|[Mao Liang] looked up at him in disbelief, furrowed his brows twice, then took out eyeshadow and eyebrow pencil from his bag, and spread a napkin flat on the table.
0:41:26|0:41:36|When he picked up the pen to start drawing, he found himself at a loss. He nervously stared at the blank paper, trying hard to calm his emotions, but he just couldn't bring himself to draw.
0:41:41|0:41:48|Speak up, [Liang Xia] picked up her handbag and walked quickly towards the restroom. Just as she entered the restroom, she encountered the cleaning lady.
0:41:48|0:41:52|Liang Xia responds half-heartedly while walking and takes out her phone.
0:41:52|0:41:56|She placed the bag on the sink and looked around to see if there was anyone else nearby.
0:41:56|0:42:0|After confirming everything was correct, she then opened the video recording function on her phone.
0:42:13|0:42:18|After speaking, he put his phone back in his bag, then took out a lipstick and wrote something on the mirror in front of him.
0:42:18|0:42:24|After doing all this, he took out a chocolate and placed it in front of him, hoping that it would help him turn the tide.
0:42:24|0:42:27|He then closed his eyes and stuffed the chocolate directly into his mouth.
0:42:28|0:42:33|At this moment, it is March 2nd, Wednesday, 7:32 PM.
0:42:33|0:42:37|After he swallowed the chocolate, he opened his eyes and looked at himself in the mirror.
0:42:37|0:42:44|At this moment, [Mao Liang] appeared behind him with his hair draped over his shoulders, slowly walking towards himself and leaning on him.
0:42:45|0:42:54|[Mao Liang] widened her eyes to admire herself in the mirror, but just as she happily twisted around, she found the words "stop looking at your phone" written on the mirror.
0:42:54|0:43:1|She reluctantly picked up the phone placed on the sink and opened the video.
0:43:1|0:43:8|Later, she swaggered over to the dining table, tossed her handbag to the side, and coolly sat on the chair.
0:43:8|0:43:12|[Mao Liang] looked at his assistant with a puzzled expression, then pulled out his phone to check Weibo.
0:43:13|0:43:24|[Liang Xia] took the phone and carefully observed, discovering the other party's name from the Weibo ID.
0:43:24|0:43:27|[Mao Liang] was left bewildered by her questions, while [Liang Xia] concealed her delight.
0:43:30|0:43:36|He ran out the door in a hurry, with [Mao Liang] closely following his back, but he never spoke.
0:43:36|0:43:45|The bustling city quieted down in the cold air, and the lights on the sides of the road seemed to be infected, emitting a faint glow, as [Liang Xia] raced on the road.
0:44:1|0:44:8|Shortly after, the two of them arrived at the construction site, where Yan Yan grabbed [Liang Xia] and ran inside.
0:44:8|0:44:15|Looking around, tall buildings stood majestically, under the night sky, the unfinished skyscrapers appeared particularly quiet and solemn. 
0:44:15|0:44:22|Yanyan covered Liang Xia's eyes from behind and they walked forward together, whispering in her ear as they walked.
0:44:25|0:44:31|At this moment, [Liang Xia] took small steps forward, nervously holding Yan Yan's arm while smiling expectantly.
0:44:31|0:44:36|Even if he steps on the ice, he is not afraid of falling, he knows [Liang Xia] will protect him.
0:44:36|0:44:49|Following that, [Liang Xia] released the hands covering his eyes, he cautiously opened them, but was greatly shocked at the moment he saw clearly, the entire cityscape came into view, with three spotlights swaying not far away.
0:44:54|0:45:0|Moved by [Mao Liang], Liang Xia turned her head to the side and looked at the city, smiling excitedly.
0:45:0|0:45:5|[Liang Xia] then indulgently held her in his arms, pressing his face against hers, enjoying the beautiful scenery together.
0:45:5|0:45:9|At this moment, [Mao Liang] is very uncomfortable, instinctively dodging.
0:45:9|0:45:13|Afterwards, [Liang Xia] confronted her face to face, but she was looking forward to [Liang Xia]'s next move.
0:45:16|0:45:27|Yanyan confessed affectionately, making [Mao Liang] ecstatic. She looked into Yanyan's eyes, but the next moment she shyly lowered her head. Then, the two embraced tightly, gazing at the beautiful scenery that belonged to them at that moment.
0:45:27|0:45:47|[Mao Liang] buried his face in her arms with a happy expression. Soon, Yan Yan stroked [Mao Liang]'s hair with both hands, while [Mao Liang] looked at her affectionately. Just as Yan Yan was about to kiss him, [Mao Liang] closed his eyes. Before the kiss could happen, a spotlight shone on their faces from below, causing both of them to frown.
0:45:47|0:45:49|Look towards the spotlight.
0:45:49|0:45:53|[Mao Liang] asked [Liang Xia] with wide eyes upon seeing the police car.
0:46:1|0:46:7|Shortly after, [Liang Xia] in the police station sat on a chair trembling, she wrapped her clothes tightly and observed everything around her.
0:46:7|0:46:11|Yanyan sat beside her, leaning against the wall, staring at her.
0:46:11|0:46:12|Suddenly, she spoke.
0:46:16|0:46:20|Yanyan leaned on her shoulder and shook her head.
0:46:20|0:46:29|[Liang Xia], despite receiving an affirmative answer, still felt worried as she paced back and forth anxiously.
0:46:35|0:46:47|[Liang Xia] was eager to open the door, but Yan Yan was not. She calmly walked towards [Liang Xia], pulled her towards the door, and kissed her without any reservation, repeatedly rubbing and kneading her lips.
0:46:47|0:46:54|[Liang Xia] was startled by the sudden kiss, but quickly accepted it. She closed her eyes and enjoyed the kiss.
0:46:54|0:47:0|At the moment when their hands touched, she held Yan Yan's hand tightly, and at that moment, the five-hour countdown ended.
0:47:6|0:47:14|After speaking, he looked at the clock hanging on the wall next to him. The time was 12:30.
0:47:14|0:47:17|[Liang Xia] nervously lowered her head, at this moment, [Bai Xiaoning] couldn't help but ask.
0:47:26|0:47:33|The police officer was about to tell [Mao Liang] the truth, but then saw the female officer approaching with [Liang Xia], she hesitated, and could only remind them once again.
0:47:38|0:47:44|After speaking, the two police officers wanted to leave, but [Mao Liang] still didn't understand the meaning behind the final advice given by the police.
0:47:44|0:47:48|He frowned and looked at [Liang Xia], and at this moment, Yan Yan also walked out.
0:47:48|0:47:51|He stood at the door, looking at the back of [Liang Xia], with many questions in his heart.
0:47:58|0:48:3|[Liang Xia] pulled her clothes up in self-blame until her entire head was wrapped inside.
0:48:18|0:48:25|After speaking, [Mao Liang] observed his actions through the rearview mirror, while [Liang Xia] in the back seat looked up at him in disbelief.
0:48:25|0:48:32|The next day, [Liang Xia] pulled out a box from under the bed with a joyful mood, then directly opened the lid and took out a sketchbook from inside.
0:48:33|0:48:37|The cover also has his exclusive signature and the year of painting, 2005.
0:48:37|0:48:50|He looked through his past paintings, each one a memory. His paintings are full of vitality, achieving a unity of realism and expressionism, meticulousness and freehand brushwork, elevating to a whole new level on paper.
0:48:51|0:48:55|In the end, his gaze fell on a page with a rose.
0:48:55|0:48:58|He watched for a long time and finally decided to pick up the paintbrush again.
0:48:58|0:49:2|Ready, he crossed his arms and stared intently at the canvas.
0:49:2|0:49:5|He then dipped the brush in paint and began sketching on the paper.
0:49:5|0:49:10|Before long, [Mao Liang] finished a painting and admired it satisfactorily.
0:49:10|0:49:13|After drawing several pictures in a row, Liang Xia seeks her best friend's appreciation.
0:49:13|0:49:16|The best friend carefully observed with a magnifying glass.
0:49:56|0:49:59|The best friend is also at a loss.
0:50:0|0:50:2|She placed her painting tools on the table.
0:50:49|0:50:56|Liang Xia, immersed in her fantasy, suddenly opens her eyes and takes out a bundle of hemp rope.
0:50:56|0:51:3|[Liang Xia] looked at the chocolate in her hand, sighed deeply, and then stuffed the chocolate into her mouth.
0:51:3|0:51:8|She looked at her best friend while chewing, and at this moment, her best friend also stared at her with a curious look on her face.
0:51:8|0:51:13|At that moment, a timer appeared in the top right corner of the screen, and the next second, Liang Xia was tied up on a chair.
0:51:14|0:51:16|Liang Xia was immediately interested in [Mao Liang].
0:51:43|0:51:53|The best friend realized it and tried to cover up the awkwardness with a smile, but [Liang Xia] was staring at her with a mischievous smile.
0:51:53|0:51:55|[Liang Xia] plucks the feather off the ornament.
0:52:17|0:52:21|Immediately, [Liang Xia] raised the feather in her hand.
0:52:21|0:52:31|Liang Xia's best friend closed her eyes tightly and turned her head to the other side. However, Liang Xia's actions at this moment shocked her friend greatly. Instead of continuing to torment her friend, Liang Xia actually loosened the restraints on her.
0:52:41|0:52:49|After speaking, the best friend stood up and walked towards the table. She immediately picked up the golden tortoise shell, ready to leave, but her thoughts were seen through by [Liang Xia] with just one glance.
0:52:49|0:53:7|[Liang Xia] excitedly stood up and slapped the stool, blocking in front of her. [Liang Xia] snatched the golden tortoise shell from her friend's hand. The friend, realizing what happened, immediately took it back. In the struggle, the tortoise shell flew out, and the copper coins and chocolates inside were thrown out. The two of them caught the scattered items respectively.
0:53:7|0:53:11|The best friend looked at the copper coin on the ground and said.
0:53:11|0:53:16|After speaking, she turned to see [Liang Xia] showing off a chocolate and then running out.
0:53:24|0:53:31|Returning home, [Liang Xia] searched everywhere for chocolate, scattering everything in the cupboard onto the floor.
0:53:31|0:53:39|She noticed a box in the oven, then walked over to pull open the oven door and took out the package. However, when she opened it, it was empty.
0:53:39|0:53:41|She then dialed the manufacturer's phone number.
0:53:52|0:53:57|He pressed 2 without hesitation, but there was no sound from the other side, so he repeatedly dialed.
0:54:8|0:54:17|[Liang Xia] lay on the sofa with a heart in turmoil, and at this moment, a timer appeared in the upper left corner again, showing 4 hours, 35 minutes, and 55 seconds.
0:54:17|0:54:20|She opened her eyes in a daze and fixed her gaze on the drinks in the refrigerator.
0:54:51|0:54:54|The two of them exchanged a glance and quickly arrived at the stadium.
0:54:54|0:55:3|Everyone is warming up, while President Gao answers a phone call first. However, the most eye-catching is President Gao's secretary, who showcases a graceful figure through stretching.
0:55:3|0:55:7|And at this moment, [Liang Xia] stood on the opposite side of him, looking at him disdainfully.
0:55:9|0:55:14|Shortly after, President Gao served the ball first, and [Mao Liang] promptly hit it back without any hesitation.
0:55:14|0:55:23|The secretary across didn't catch it. Everyone looked at him in shock, but when [Mao Liang] turned around, [Liang Xia] immediately wiped the smile off his face.
0:55:23|0:55:34|After speaking, President Gao prepared to serve again. [Mao Liang] awkwardly retreated to his position. This time, he did not show off. He lost several rounds in a row to the opponent, feeling less and less interested in the game. He sat on the side to rest.
0:55:47|0:56:0|Shortly after, [Mao Liang] picked up the drink next to him and took a sip, but at that moment, his phone rang.
0:56:24|0:56:29|At this moment, [Liang Xia] had no idea that Little Liang Xia had melted chocolate into the drink he had just taken a sip of.
0:56:49|0:56:55|Mao Liang angrily hung up the phone, but Gao Zong walked over.
0:56:55|0:56:57|Little [Mao Liang] looked him up and down disdainfully.
0:57:2|0:57:14|The on-screen battle values of the two characters appeared, with [Mao Liang] looking around anxiously. Then, little [Mao Liang] exerted all his strength to hit the ball over, scaring Gao Zong, causing his battle value to instantly decrease by 6. [Mao Liang] looked at little [Mao Liang] in disbelief.
0:57:17|0:57:26|Mr. Gao adjusted his posture and prepared to receive the serve, while in the rest area, Bai Xiaoning kept signaling to Liang Xia, but Liang Xia ignored her, sneered, and turned to serve the ball.
0:57:26|0:57:34|This time, Gao did not underestimate the situation. He caught the ball steadily, and the two of them played several rounds back and forth, but they couldn't determine the winner.
0:57:34|0:57:42|Mao Liang and his assistant looked on in shock as the ball swung back and forth, but the two players on the field became more and more intense, determined to determine the winner.
0:57:43|0:57:48|Little [Mao Liang] Xia didn't want to entangle anymore, so she made a big move, and the ball flew spinning towards the opposite side.
0:57:48|0:57:53|Mr. Gao rushed forward upon seeing the situation, but still failed to catch it, and fell heavily to the ground.
0:57:53|0:58:2|At this moment, the combat value has dropped to zero.
0:58:2|0:58:10|Mao Liang and his assistant, Bai Xiaoning, widened their eyes and immediately stepped forward to check.
0:58:14|0:58:22|At this moment, there were only the ball and the racket left on the opposite court.
0:58:22|0:58:27|On the other side, Yan Yan drove with little [Mao Liang] Xia and his friends speeding across the bridge.
0:58:34|0:58:48|Night falls, the stars twinkle, like many little lanterns decorating the monotonous night sky. As the stars gradually increase, the earth also merges into the night. People set up tents under the starry sky, chatting freely.
0:58:57|0:59:15|Yanyan slowly lifted Liang Xia's hand while holding it, she propped herself up and pressed Liang Xiaoning underneath her. Liang Xiaoning was at a loss and trembling, but Yanyan thought it was because Liang Xiaoning was shy. She continued her actions, but Liang Xiaoning pushed her away in disbelief.
0:59:15|0:59:21|Liang Xia turned her head to the side, avoiding Yan Yan's gaze. Seeing her aversion, Yan Yan sat up and asked.
0:59:22|0:59:33|Little [Liang Xia] saw that he had misunderstood, immediately sat up, frowned at him sternly, and after Little [Liang Xia] finished speaking, she withdrew her gaze, lowered her head, and stated her own reasons.
0:59:33|0:59:40|The tense expression relaxed, and then he gently placed his hands on Liang Xia's shoulders, kissing her cheek tenderly.
0:59:40|0:59:51|Little [Liang Xia] closed her eyes, trying to accept it. Mao Liang's hand, which was about to touch Little [Liang Xia]'s chest, was caught by her just in time, and she noticed the time on his watch.
0:59:52|1:0:0|Soon after, Liang Xia pushed him away with both hands, unzipped the tent, took a coat and walked out, leaving only Yan Yan sitting alone in the tent.
1:0:0|1:0:10|Liang Xia rushed to a secluded spot away from the crowd, panting heavily. She took out her phone, adjusted her breath, and then raised the phone to press the record button.
1:0:15|1:0:17|Little [Liang Xia] said shyly.
1:0:25|1:0:29|After speaking, she pressed the pause button and looked towards the camping direction.
1:0:29|1:0:35|At this moment, a countdown appeared in the lower left corner of the screen, with less than half a minute left of her own time.
1:0:35|1:0:39|Gradually, Liang Xia closed her tired, sleepy eyes and retreated into the background, disappearing.
1:0:39|1:0:47|[Liang Xia] took off her wig and returned to the tent. She slowly bent down and looked at Yan Yan lying inside.
1:0:47|1:0:51|Liang Xia ignored her and sat down on the sleeping bag inside the tent.
1:1:0|1:1:2|Yanyan looked affectionately at the profile of [Liang Xia].
1:1:30|1:1:34|[Liang Xia] was shocked by the sudden confession, and suddenly sat up and held her face.
1:1:34|1:1:38|After hesitating for a moment, [Liang Xia] closed his eyes tightly and kissed her on the cheek.
1:1:38|1:1:42|While Yan Yan was complacent, [Liang Xia] threw her coat in front of her.
1:1:44|1:1:49|Yanyan stood still in an instant, while [Liang Xia] had already walked out with her bag.
1:1:49|1:1:57|The next day, in order to prevent accidents, [Liang Xia] poured all the drinks in the refrigerator into the sink, and then threw the bottles into the trash can.
1:1:57|1:2:8|Next, Liang Xia took out a thick book from the bookshelf, opened it on her arm, revealing a hole inside the book filled with magical chocolates. Then Liang Xia walked out holding the book.
1:2:31|1:2:35|Little [Liang Xia] listened to the voice message while drawing, and soon completed a painting.
1:2:35|1:2:39|And the two women in the painting, arms crossed, back to back, just like them at this moment.
1:2:39|1:2:45|On the other side, while repairing the motorcycle, [Liang Xia] received a phone call. She took out her phone and saw that the caller was actually [Mao Liang].
1:3:13|1:3:18|[Liang Xia] hung up the phone with a disappointed look on her face, and at that moment, her companion came to find her.
1:3:28|1:3:33|The companion nodded uninterestingly and walked away, while [Liang Xia] continued with the task at hand.
1:3:33|1:3:38|On the other side, Liang Xia placed the words on Mao Liang's desk.
1:3:47|1:3:52|With only two hours left for Liang Xia, she turned back and smiled lightly before walking out.
1:3:52|1:3:58|Later, Liang Xia and Mao Liang arrived at the Haunted Hospital, where the lighting was extremely dim and the atmosphere exceptionally eerie.
1:3:58|1:4:9|Liang Xia immediately shook off her hand, Mao Liang looked at Liang Xia questioningly, but Liang Xia pushed her out. At this moment, a hand rested on her shoulder.
1:4:11|1:4:17|Suddenly, Scarface approached Liang Xia with a gaping mouth full of blood.
1:4:17|1:4:29|The scar-faced man pointed to the other side with his finger, and Liang Xia handed the prosthetic hand back to him and turned to leave. But when he opened the door, the people inside grinned and shouted at him, and he excitedly walked into the middle of the crowd.
1:4:42|1:4:45|He lay on the hospital bed, surrounded by everyone.
1:4:45|1:4:50|At this moment, a timer appears in the bottom right corner, only a few seconds left before [Mao Liang] returns.
1:4:50|1:4:55|Before long, [Mao Liang] opened his eyes and was terrified by the scene.
1:4:55|1:5:1|He quickly got up and kept dodging the zombies, grabbing medical supplies nearby and throwing them up.
1:5:9|1:5:18|The staff in the haunted house quickly ran outside, with [Liang Xia] chasing after them menacingly, but a iron gate blocked the staff's way.
1:5:18|1:5:34|Liang Xia, who was fighting against the ghosts outside, looked inside in shock, and then picked up something next to her and threw it at them.
1:5:47|1:5:56|[Liang Xia] calmly nibbled on a chicken wing, while the man opposite her, encouraged by his friends, raced to eat the wings. Yan Yan stood by, indulgently watching the young [Liang Xia].
1:5:56|1:6:7|Before long, the man couldn't hold on any longer and fell down in agony.
1:6:10|1:6:17|[Liang Xia] leisurely took a sip of her drink, then confidently ate a piece of magical chocolate and raised her sword in triumph.
1:6:17|1:6:31|At that moment, under the influence of the spicy food, Liang Xia suddenly felt a stomachache. She rushed to the toilet and opened the door, but the dilapidated condition of the toilet made her stop in her tracks. However, the pain in her stomach was unbearable.
1:6:31|1:6:56|Terrified, [Liang Xia] immediately closed the door and turned to open another one. She looked at the old toilet with helplessness, but at this moment, her stomach churned again. She could only endure the terrible environment and go to the bathroom. Meanwhile, [Bai Xiaoning] searched around for him.
1:6:56|1:6:58|Yan Yan reluctantly got on the motorcycle.
1:7:10|1:7:15|[Liang Xia], who was in the bathroom, heard the sound of a motorcycle outside the window and instantly panicked.
1:7:15|1:7:21|He was about to stand up and shout, but then a sharp pain struck his stomach. 
1:7:21|1:7:26|He could only sit down again in resignation, propping himself up with one hand on the partition to ease the discomfort.
1:7:26|1:7:28|Soon after, the two communicated using their voices.
1:7:29|1:7:36|With the help of Liang Xia, Mao Liang quickly completed all of Gao's requirements, and the two of them officially signed the contract.
1:8:1|1:8:12|[Bai Xiaoning] looked at him with relief, the two of them exchanged excited smiles, and President Gao said.
1:8:12|1:8:20|CEO tightly held Liang Xia's hand, giving hope to everyone. Liang Xia looked at Mao Liang relieved, he finally did it, also showing his own value.
1:8:20|1:8:24|Later, [Liang Xia] sat outside with her best friend, and the two of them laughed heartily in the private room.
1:8:26|1:8:28|[Liang Xia] also thought it was good, nodding in satisfaction.
1:8:28|1:8:30|Through the crack of the door, the best friend saw the figure of [Mao Liang], and the two immediately leaned against the door frame.
1:9:22|1:9:31|The two of them lowered their heads in disappointment, then returned home. He watched the video of [Mao Liang] confessing to him ten years ago.
1:10:29|1:10:34|At this moment, [Liang Xia] was already in tears, and then she rewound the video to the beginning.
1:10:38|1:10:48|While watching, the two of them kept stuffing snacks into their mouths. After finishing, he reached out to the pile of snacks beside him, mistakenly picked up the magic chocolate from the bag, and stuffed it into his mouth without even looking at it.
1:10:48|1:10:56|After a while, Liang Xia realized that the taste was off. He looked down at the packaging paper in his hand, then quickly bent over the trash can and started vomiting uncontrollably.
1:11:2|1:11:9|Suddenly, [Liang Xia] felt a moment of confusion. She abruptly lifted her head, swayed to her feet, with a buzzing sound still ringing in her ears.
1:11:9|1:11:17|At this moment, the timer appeared, and Liang Xia lifted her hair, looking confusedly at the messy ground.
1:11:32|1:11:39|At night, [Mao Liang] returned home from work. Just as he closed the door, he saw a card on the floor with the words "Take a good look" written on it.
1:11:39|1:11:42|Later, he opened the file bag on the table and took out the CD with [Mao Liang]'s confession video printed on it, and suddenly realized.
1:11:56|1:11:59|At this moment, he was also pulled back into memories from ten years ago.
1:11:59|1:12:5|The next day, [Liang Xia] and [Mao Liang] were wearing aprons for painting, holding a cloth in their left hand and a paintbrush in their right hand, lying in the middle of the studio.
1:12:5|1:12:12|Not long after, Liang Xia woke up groggily. As soon as he saw the painting on the wall clearly, he immediately became alert, got up, and admired the painting in front of him.
1:12:12|1:12:17|The scene is dominated by two teenage girls, but they are in completely different environments.
1:12:18|1:12:29|The girl on the left is full of vitality and vigor, surrounded by blooming flowers. The girl on the right is full of charm, sometimes shy and sometimes gentle like water, exuding the mature aura of a young woman.
1:12:29|1:12:40|The two approached each other, reaching out to try to accept each other, the painting of the two of them resembling them at this moment. They were completely absorbed in watching, when suddenly, he noticed a message left on the small drawing board.
1:12:44|1:12:50|He smiled with relief and lowered his head, inspired by [Liang Xia], he decided to start anew.
1:12:50|1:13:0|He put a new piece of paper on the small drawing board, fixed its four corners with pushpins, and squeezed the required colors onto the palette.
1:14:26|1:14:33|[Mao Liang] stopped the closing elevator door, and [Liang Xia] inside looked at him calmly, just as [Mao Liang] was about to speak.
1:14:34|1:14:47|The assistant calmly walked into the elevator, [Liang Xia] responded to her greeting with a smile, but quickly turned around and the smile disappeared. Soon, the elevator reached the first floor.
1:14:47|1:14:53|Shortly after, she quickly walked out of the elevator. Inside the mall, the cosmetics packaged with products from [Liang Xia] were well received by the public.
1:15:8|1:15:20|On the other side, [Liang Xia] sat in front of the mirror, just finished her makeup. The makeup artist was about to curl her hair with a curling iron.
1:15:20|1:15:22|At this moment, Liang Xia's best friend walked over with a tablet.
1:15:25|1:15:27|At this moment, the factory was shrouded in thick smoke.
1:16:0|1:16:5|The best friend paused the live stream, looking at [Liang Xia] with a worried expression.
1:16:5|1:16:8|At this moment, [Liang Xia] was also at a loss.
1:16:8|1:16:15|Continuing, the two sat in the car on their way to the art exhibition, and Liang Xia's best friend took out a chocolate and asked.
1:16:20|1:16:22|After speaking, [Liang Xia] looked confidently at her best friend.
1:16:22|1:16:28|The two of them exchanged smiles, and she took the magic chocolate from her best friend's hand, unwrapping the chocolate packaging.
1:16:28|1:16:33|She looked at the chocolate in her hand, looking forward to the arrival of little [Liang Xia], and then ate it in one bite.
1:16:33|1:16:42|With the luxury car slowly approaching, the surrounding reporters and fans excitedly expressed their admiration. Then the car door opened, revealing a pair of sneakers.
1:16:42|1:16:45|Liang Xia blew kisses in response to the enthusiasm of each fan.
1:16:48|1:16:56|The scale of this art exhibition is huge, with an entire wall filled with works by [Liang Xia], each painting captivating the viewers.
1:16:56|1:17:2|The bustling crowd came in waves to admire, everyone immersed in the artistic conception of the painting.
1:17:2|1:17:6|The art exhibition center has prepared a rich variety of food and drinks for everyone.
1:17:11|1:17:14|[Liang Xia] turned around and waved to the reporters behind her.
1:17:14|1:17:26|Finally, she lifted her skirt and walked onto the stage, taking out her phone and recording everyone from behind.
1:17:51|1:17:55|She turned around to face everyone, while [Mao Liang] looked thoughtfully at the ground.
1:18:11|1:18:17|Liang Xia, who was immersed in the joy of success, suddenly had a big change in her expression, and the smile on her face disappeared instantly.
1:18:17|1:18:25|The crowd began to gossip in private when they saw her acting so unusually.
1:18:25|1:18:27|The best friend quickly came out to help defuse the situation.
1:18:46|1:18:54|[Liang Xia] nervously walked down the stage, and her best friend's heart was also in knots at this moment, her eyes closely following [Liang Xia].
1:18:55|1:19:2|The crowd looked at [Liang Xia] with great anticipation, but at this moment, [Liang Xia] felt extremely nervous and didn't even dare to look up at President Gao.
1:19:3|1:19:8|After speaking, she walked through the crowd and left.
1:19:8|1:19:11|The crowd was talking excitedly, but she remained indifferent.
1:19:11|1:19:16|She then entered the bathroom and took out a magical chocolate, placing it by the sink.
1:19:16|1:19:22|After watching for a long time, she lifted her head and looked at herself in the mirror, with a hint of determination in her confused eyes.
1:19:22|1:19:26|Then, she slowly picked up her phone and pressed the record button to start recording.
1:19:30|1:19:37|After speaking, she smiled at the screen, then pressed the pause button. She looked at herself in the mirror, constantly cheering herself on.
1:19:37|1:19:42|With the help of Liang Xia, she decided to break through the current situation and rediscover her former self.
1:19:42|1:19:46|So, she returned to the art exhibition and walked into the crowd.
1:19:46|1:19:51|She raised her head and chest, and when she saw [Mao Liang] looking at her with a worried expression, she shyly lowered her head.
1:19:51|1:20:6|Approaching her best friend, Liang Xia stopped in her tracks, handed the magic chocolate in her hand to her, and gestured for her to look at him in surprise. Then, with confidence, Mao Liang walked up to the podium and stood directly in front of the easel.
1:20:6|1:20:14|He looked at the dimensions of the canvas, and in his mind involuntarily appeared what he wanted to express at this moment, with [Bai Xiaoning] standing by, smiling satisfactorily.
1:20:14|1:20:21|Liang Xia looked on with satisfaction, holding magical chocolate in her hand, as she watched Mao Liang pick up a paintbrush and delicately sketch on the paper.
1:20:23|1:20:31|He focused on the tip of the pen, oblivious to everything around him, only the sound of the pencil rubbing against the paper, reclaiming his world.
1:20:31|1:20:38|At this moment, [Liang Xia] unexpectedly caught the attention of [Mao Liang], making the assistant look at [Mao Liang] with jealousy.
1:20:38|1:20:43|Unconsciously, [Liang Xia] has started to add colors to the painting, enriching the details of the picture with different hues.
1:21:8|1:21:11|After the art exhibition, [Mao Liang] personally drove [Liang Xia] home.
1:21:11|1:21:16|And at this moment, [Liang Xia] sitting in the back seat, couldn't help but feel secretly delighted as she looked out the window.
1:21:16|1:21:20|Suddenly, [Mao Liang] put down the visor and looked at [Liang Xia] through the rearview mirror.
1:21:20|1:21:26|At this moment, [Liang Xia] was drawn by his actions, slowly turned to look at the rearview mirror, and then looked at him.
1:21:33|1:21:39|[Liang Xia] pursed his lips and looked out the window. He finally got [Mao Liang]'s explanation, but he had already let it go.
1:22:12|1:22:16|He finally took off all his disguises and faced the most authentic self.
1:22:16|1:22:22|Next, [Mao Liang] parked the car by the roadside, turned around in confusion, and looked at him sitting in the back.
1:22:22|1:22:26|[Liang Xia] calmly finished speaking, then turned and opened the car door to get out.
1:22:26|1:22:30|He closed the door and walked away from the car in the opposite direction without any nostalgia.
1:22:30|1:22:34|And at this moment, [Mao Liang] sitting in the car was feeling a mix of emotions.
1:22:34|1:22:38|Back home, [Liang Xia] sat in the studio watching all the videos of her interacting with little [Liang Xia].
1:23:16|1:23:21|Turn off the phone, a beautiful scene of young Liang Xia flashes in Liang Xia's mind.
1:23:21|1:23:29|She then looked up at the paintings covering the entire wall, all of which were the result of her and [Liang Xia]'s joint efforts, belonging to the beautiful memories of the two of them.
1:23:29|1:23:32|Suddenly, she remembered the words her best friend had reminded her of before.
1:23:35|1:23:50|So she shifted her gaze to the magic chocolate at the corner of the table, silently making a decision.
1:23:50|1:23:57|On the other side, Liang Xia's motorcycle team, led by Yan Yan, stopped by the roadside, playing and frolicking in groups of three or five.
1:23:57|1:24:4|[Bai Xiaoning] changed her usual style and leisurely walked towards them, but she suddenly saw a girl approaching Yan Yan, and the two of them seemed very intimate.
1:24:8|1:24:14|He stood there at a loss, and when he saw them approaching him, he immediately ran to the corner of the wall to secretly observe them.
1:24:19|1:24:29|A series of motorcycles sped forward, and when there was no sound, [Bai Xiaoning] slowly turned her head and stared intently at the back of the girl on the motorcycle.
1:24:29|1:24:36|Until the motorcycle team disappeared from view, she withdrew her gaze, her eyes vacant at this moment, allowing tears to slide down her cheeks.
1:24:36|1:24:40|Back home, Liang Xia curled up on the floor, surrounded by scattered snacks.
1:24:41|1:24:47|Before long, he stretched his body and saw the spiritual stone in front of him. He looked puzzled and slowly got up from the ground.
1:24:47|1:24:56|At the same time, he observed the messy ground, suddenly, he stared at the wall and walked forward, his hair disheveled, and his eye makeup smudged on his face.
1:24:56|1:25:6|At this moment, a earth-shattering change had already taken place on the opposite wall. The girl in the picture was pointing to her head with her fingers, tears streaming down her cheeks.
1:25:6|1:25:9|This painting vividly reflects the current mood of [Liang Xia].
1:25:16|1:25:26|Later, [Mao Liang] arrived at Yan Yan's club and saw Yan Yan and the girl sitting at the table, chatting and laughing.
1:25:58|1:26:3|Liang Xia stood there in confusion, watching his back as he wiped the water off his face.
1:26:7|1:26:18|Suddenly, a fist came towards Yan Yan.
1:26:18|1:26:24|Yan Yan, lying on the ground, raised her hand to signal her companions to stop, and then her companions started the motorcycle to help her.
1:26:33|1:26:37|The two quickly engaged in a fierce fight, with no clear advantage.
1:26:37|1:26:40|[Mao Liang] tightly hugged Yan Yan's waist and slammed her against the wall.
1:26:40|1:26:43|Yanyan kept using her elbows to hit his back.
1:26:43|1:26:53|Suddenly, [Mao Liang] picked up Yan Yan's clothes.
1:26:53|1:26:56|On the other side, Liang Xia arrived at her best friend's house.
1:26:58|1:27:2|[Liang Xia] stopped in the middle of the living room, let out a deep sigh, and turned to look at her best friend.
1:27:7|1:27:28|The best friend took the phone handed over by [Liang Xia], then [Liang Xia] swallowed the chocolate in one bite, and immediately after, little [Liang Xia] stared at the phone.
1:27:28|1:27:32|The best friend turned to Liang Xia and placed her hand on her arm to comfort her.
1:27:34|1:27:51|The best friend looked helpless as [Liang Xia] glared at her fiercely, causing her to immediately turn her head away in fear.
1:27:51|1:27:55|Finally, [Liang Xia] arrived at the Yan Yan Club and knocked fiercely on the door.
1:27:55|1:27:58|She saw Yan Yan open the door and immediately pushed her inside.
1:28:3|1:28:17|She was talking while taking off her clothes, and when she tried to take off Yan Yan's clothes, her hands were caught.
1:28:17|1:28:20|Liang Xia gently lifted her face.
1:28:30|1:28:40|The girl rushed forward and gave a slap to Liang Xia, finally pushing away Yan Yan's arm blocking in front of her.
1:28:40|1:28:45|Little [Liang Xia] suppressed the unwillingness in her heart.
1:28:45|1:28:50|Tears welled up in her eyes as she looked at Yan Yan, but Yan Yan avoided her gaze, so she turned and walked away.
1:29:17|1:29:23|The speechless Liang Xia looked at her best friend with a face full of grievances, while at this moment, her best friend was so angry that she couldn't say a word.
1:29:25|1:29:31|The anger in Liang Xia's heart was boiling, she tried hard to suppress it, but could only turn her head to the other side.
1:29:31|1:29:35|Little [Liang Xia] saw that she was unmoved, so she vented her anger on the bookshelf.
1:29:35|1:29:41|Suddenly, a book containing chocolates fell to the ground, and [Liang Xia] quickly went forward to pick it up.
1:29:47|1:30:0|The best friend tightly held the hand of Liang Xia to stop her, but at this moment, Liang Xia looked at her fiercely. The best friend looked at her with heartache in her eyes, tears stubbornly falling from the corner of her eyes. Afraid that she would do something excessive, she could only helplessly let go.
1:30:0|1:30:4|She slowly got up, but her eyes never left.
1:30:4|1:30:10|Little [Liang Xia], who got the chocolate, crazily stuffed it into her mouth, without even tearing off the wrapping paper on the outside.
1:30:14|1:30:19|Liang Xia's best friend looked at her current disheveled appearance, tears streaming down her face.
1:30:19|1:30:29|The next day, [Liang Xia] quickly ran into the train station, looking around for [Bai Xiaoning]'s figure. The scene of their meeting came to mind, everything felt like it was just yesterday.
1:30:46|1:30:53|Suddenly, [Liang Xia] saw [Bai Xiaoning] by the train.
1:31:9|1:31:14|The opposite [Bai Xiaoning] didn't hear her call, and continued to hold her girlfriend's hand and walk forward.
1:31:14|1:31:24|Shortly after, [Liang Xia] felt dizzy and her consciousness became blurred. Just as she was about to collapse, she managed to grab the handrail next to her in time, then knelt down on the ground and shouted with all her strength.
1:31:26|1:31:36|[Bai Xiaoning], who was being scanned, seemed to hear her voice. But when she turned around to search for her in the crowd, she didn't find her. Disappointed, [Bai Xiaoning] turned back and walked into the train.
1:31:36|1:31:45|Liang Xia, through the crowd, saw Bai Xiaoning unmoved, supported her own beliefs, and then collapsed instantly, her body heavily crashing to the ground.
1:31:45|1:31:49|At the moment of losing consciousness, [Liang Xia] seemed to have entered her own inner world.
1:31:50|1:31:56|Surrounded by thick smoke, it was only after breaking through the layers of smoke that the figure of [Liang Xia] was discovered.
1:31:56|1:32:1|She clung tightly to his thigh, curled up on the ground, still gasping for breath.
1:32:1|1:32:5|At this moment, her heart was filled with an immense sense of loneliness, like an abandoned child.
1:32:36|1:32:39|Upon hearing Liang Xia's call, Liang Xia slowly stood up.
1:32:39|1:32:45|[Liang Xia] breathed a sigh of relief when she found her.
1:32:45|1:32:48|Little [Liang Xia] stood still, already crying like a tearful person.
1:32:51|1:32:54|Her body was filled with various medical solutions by the doctor, her face extremely pale.
1:33:26|1:33:34|Empathetic [Liang Xia] patiently persuades little [Liang Xia], moving closer step by step and reaching out with open arms to welcome her return.
1:33:34|1:33:40|Little [Liang Xia] seemed to take her words to heart, clenched her fists, and slowly moved towards her.
1:33:40|1:33:48|Little [Liang Xia] reached out to touch, but just as the two were about to make contact, they were separated by a transparent wall.
1:33:48|1:33:50|Liang Xia touches the wall in surprise.
1:33:58|1:34:8|The nurse immediately injected adrenaline, and following the IV tube, you can see that [Liang Xia] at this moment seems to be immersed in the ocean.
1:34:8|1:34:11|[Liang Xia] urgently raised both hands and struck the transparent wall.
1:34:13|1:34:19|Suddenly, the transparent wall was struck and cracked, and [Liang Xia] used all her strength to hit it.
1:34:19|1:34:25|With the shattering of the transparent wall, [Liang Xia] in the hospital's heart stopped beating instantly, and the defibrillator emitted a piercing sound.
1:34:25|1:34:35|The doctor's hands overlapped, pressing firmly against the patient's chest using the strength of the upper body, while on the other side, the floating Liang Xia let the sea water carry her away.
1:34:36|1:34:40|He also reached out to [Liang Xia] at the same time, praying that he could save himself.
1:34:40|1:34:46|At this moment, [Liang Xia] exerted all her strength to swim towards little [Liang Xia], then she reached out her hands and tightly embraced her in her arms.
1:34:50|1:34:56|Just as the two were immersed in the joy of reunion, a subtle change occurred in little [Liang Xia]'s body.
1:34:56|1:34:59|She frowned as she watched the disintegrating hand.
1:34:59|1:35:7|At that moment, [Liang Xia] also noticed this phenomenon, she looked incredulously at little [Liang Xia], then lifted her face to examine carefully.
1:35:7|1:35:12|In the hospital bed, [Liang Xia] looked pale, without a trace of color in her face, with an oxygen tube inserted in her nose.
1:35:25|1:35:34|Little [Liang Xia] finished speaking, and [Liang Xia] looked at her with a touched expression. Just as she was about to disappear, Little [Liang Xia] used all her strength to push [Liang Xia] upwards.
1:35:34|1:35:44|At this moment, [Liang Xia] did not resist again. She knew that little [Liang Xia] had never left her from the beginning to the end. Instead, it was her own timidity that prevented her from facing reality and losing herself.
1:35:44|1:35:50|[Liang Xia] knew that this parting was a farewell forever. She stared at little [Liang Xia]'s face, watching her slowly disappear.
1:36:16|1:36:25|At this moment, [Liang Xia] floating in the water is surrounded by many bubbles, as if little [Liang Xia] has turned into small bubbles to protect her, carrying her towards the surface of the water.
1:36:25|1:36:29|In the hospital, [the doctor] saw that the heart resuscitation was ineffective and prepared to use electric shock to stimulate the heart.
1:36:33|1:36:43|At this moment, the words of a nurse drew the attention of everyone present to the bedside heart monitor, which no longer displayed a flat line and the heart rate was gradually increasing.
1:36:43|1:36:54|Liang Xia, lying on the hospital bed, had tears in the corners of her eyes. She struggled to open her eyes, still unable to recover from the pain of losing little Liang Xia. Tears rolled down her cheeks.
1:36:54|1:37:0|Following that, she closed her eyes and turned her head to the other side, but the overwhelming sadness could not be suppressed.
1:37:1|1:37:7|So, [Liang Xia] furrowed her brows, cried softly, and after a while, she slowly opened her eyes.
1:37:7|1:37:13|At this moment, she remembered what little [Liang Xia] had said, that she would never leave him.
1:37:13|1:37:16|Afterwards, she relaxed her furrowed brow and her emotions also eased a lot.
1:37:16|1:37:23|From this point on, [Liang Xia] regained her dream, finding back everything she had lost in the past ten years.
1:37:36|1:37:44|Several years later, [Liang Xia]'s artistic photos appeared on the covers of major magazines, and his design works were almost adopted by the entire industry.
1:37:44|1:37:48|From a shut-in to a renowned designer, his success is there for all to see.
1:37:49|1:37:55|Yanyan, passing by the street, inadvertently noticed on the big screen of the mall playing the magazine of [Liang Xia].
1:37:55|1:38:0|She stared thoughtfully at the big screen, then reluctantly put on her helmet and drove away.
1:38:18|1:38:21|[Liang Xia] looked back excitedly.
1:38:48|1:38:57|He leaned against the window and looked down, then [Mao Liang] shouted loudly.
1:39:5|1:39:18|After speaking, [Liang Xia] flipped her hair and glanced at him from the corner of her eye, then looked outside at [Mao Liang]. At this moment, [Mao Liang] still firmly held up the sign saying "I love you, [Liang Xia]" and stood in place waiting for his response.
1:39:18|1:39:25|Finally, the scene shows a message written by Liang Xia to Liang Xia against the backdrop of a watercolor painting.
