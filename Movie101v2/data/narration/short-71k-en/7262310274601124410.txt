0:0:26|0:0:31|The family consists of thirteen members, and today is the annual New Year's Day.
0:0:31|0:0:37|Uncle Cheng returned home after being away for half a year, filled with joy to reunite with his family.
0:0:37|0:0:47|The children and grandchildren didn't all return home until the first day of the lunar new year. They thought they could finally enjoy a happy reunion meal with the family, but one unpleasant incident after another occurred.
0:0:48|0:0:59|This year, [Father] and [Mother] also lost interest in celebrating the New Year. Everyone kept talking about money, and the reunion dinner that only happened once a year ended in embarrassment and awkwardness.
0:0:59|0:1:10|The scene of breaking up without spending money has always haunted [Father], so one day after the farce, he and his wife flew away, leaving the home where they had lived for a lifetime.
0:1:13|0:1:18|The [Big Brother] of the elderly couple admired Teacher Muna since he was young, but ended up with a fierce and domineering daughter-in-law.
0:1:18|0:1:23|[Second Sister's Husband] is a well-known official, but he can't seem to shake off his habit of being a womanizer.
0:1:23|0:1:32|There is Second Sister, who was once determined to marry a man of status, causing a lot of trouble at home. The couple now supports themselves and live a peaceful life.
0:1:33|0:1:46|But the worst was yet to come. Their [Younger Son] indulged in all kinds of pleasures without working, and even found a girlfriend who was also unemployed and famous for nothing. All she did was ask for money and seek enjoyment every day.
0:1:46|0:1:55|[Father] and [Mother] recalled the scene of last year's New Year's Eve dinner, with [Sister-in-law] angrily smashing a mirror, everyone else arguing loudly, and the dinner ending in discord.
0:1:56|0:2:3|Chinese families may be the most intriguing, a reality that people are reluctant to admit but have to face.
0:2:3|0:2:7|Once-a-year reunion dinner, also a mirror reflecting the Chinese-style family dynamics.
0:2:7|0:2:16|At the dinner table, behind the filial piety of [Father] and the love between brothers, is actually a group of relatives who have been estranged for generations.
0:2:16|0:2:19|Fortunately, not all families are like this.
0:2:19|0:2:25|After watching this movie, you will have a deeper understanding of the rural folk life in China after the reform and opening up.
0:2:26|0:2:35|Actress [Zhao Lirong] won the Best Actress award at the 4th Tokyo International Film Festival and the 15th Hundred Flowers Awards for this film.
0:2:35|0:2:40|Even though filmed in the 1990s, it still remains a classic today.
0:2:42|0:2:48|The story begins in a bustling market, where the crowd is noisy and filled with people shopping for the New Year.
0:2:48|0:2:55|A woman is rushing home, panting heavily, with a tired look on her face, dragging a cart full of meat and other New Year goods behind her.
0:2:55|0:2:59|She couldn't move it by herself, and there were enthusiastic children helping her push the New Year goods behind her.
0:3:8|0:3:14|The sound of bargaining in the market seemed out of place, with smiles on everyone's faces around.
0:3:16|0:3:28|The woman in this scene is [Mrs. Cheng], with the children following behind her, exerting all their strength to help her push the cart. She awkwardly opens her wallet while walking towards home.
0:3:28|0:3:33|[Mrs. Cheng] just arrived home, on the other side is the old [Father] of the [Cheng family], [Mrs. Cheng] is back.
0:3:34|0:3:38|He skis gracefully down the snow-covered mountain top with a hunched back.
0:3:38|0:3:41|This is his first time returning home after being away for over half a year.
0:3:41|0:3:47|This time back home, he bought a bunch of New Year goods with his homemade climbing pears, preparing to celebrate the New Year with his children.
0:3:47|0:3:53|Uncle Jiancheng stumbled down the high snow slope, and the two lanterns he was carrying swayed in the wind after he climbed up.
0:3:53|0:3:56|He cheered himself on as he descended the mountain.
0:4:3|0:4:10|Even though a shot was fired, he still burst into laughter. As he dragged [Father] towards home, they heard the sound of fast-paced wooden clappers coming from the courtyard.
0:4:28|0:4:50|It turned out that there were three or five comic actors trying to please the audience. I saw [Middle-aged Woman] reluctantly take out a five yuan note from her small cloth bag.
0:4:50|0:4:52|Mother took out a ten yuan note again.
0:5:8|0:5:15|He didn't know that [Uncle Cheng] was already at the doorstep, when a familiar voice could be heard not far away.
0:5:15|0:5:20|He turned around and all the wrinkles smoothed out instantly, it turned out to be [Uncle Cheng] who had returned.
0:5:34|0:5:37|Uncle Cheng raised his hand and put it back on him, his eyes full of indulgence.
0:5:37|0:5:47|Uncle Cheng takes out the prepared silver goods.
0:5:53|0:6:18|[Mrs. Cheng] asked in confusion. Then, [Mrs. Cheng] turned around and added another sentence. [Mr. Cheng] looked disdainful. He then packed up the New Year goods. He awkwardly unloaded a bicycle from the pear tree, his face filled with disappointment and anger, and asked.
0:6:27|0:6:32|[Mother] walked back home in a daze.
0:6:48|0:6:50|Welcome, [Father] and [Mother] made an appearance.
0:6:50|0:6:55|As the sky darkens, the table in the kitchen is set with the New Year's Eve dinner prepared by [Mrs. Cheng].
0:6:55|0:7:1|[Uncle Cheng] sat alone at the table, staring blankly ahead with his eyes lowered, showing no interest in the New Year's Eve dinner.
0:7:1|0:7:10|Cheng [Father] didn't start this New Year's Eve dinner by picking up chopsticks to taste it, but by picking up a bottle of wine, filling the glasses for the two of them as he spoke.
0:7:19|0:7:30|Chen [Father] was both surprised and delighted.
0:7:30|0:7:31|The couple smiled at each other.
0:7:43|0:7:50|After a moment, the atmosphere suddenly quieted down, and the faces of the elderly couple both darkened.
0:7:50|0:7:54|To ease the awkward silence, Cheng [Father] smiled and set aside the wine.
0:8:1|0:8:1|Cheng [Mother] looks shy on her face.
0:8:26|0:8:29|Mother Cheng had a sullen face, followed closely by Father Cheng's words.
0:8:32|0:8:35|In the darkness, Cheng [Father] finishes his drink once again.
0:8:35|0:8:39|The dishes on the table seemed untouched, but Father had already downed several glasses of alcohol.
0:8:39|0:8:42|Mother Cheng watched her husband drinking alone with a heavy expression.
0:8:52|0:8:55|The wine glass was placed down, and the two of them sat in silence facing each other.
0:8:55|0:8:59|Outside the window, the colorful fireworks contrasted with the desolation of this home.
0:8:59|0:9:4|Fireworks are blooming in the sky, while inside the house, there is a silent scene of the two elderly people looking at each other.
0:9:4|0:9:7|At this moment, [Uncle Cheng] covered his stomach and let out a cold laugh.
0:9:9|0:9:17|Opening the tightly wrapped package, they found several stacks of thick banknotes inside, totaling around one hundred thousand yuan.
0:9:17|0:9:24|He took out all the banknotes with a stern attitude, [Uncle Cheng] placed the banknotes on the table, one tower, two towers, three towers.
0:9:25|0:9:29|This is all his hard-earned money from the past half year, already occupying the entire table.
0:9:30|0:9:37|[Mrs. Cheng] looked terrified and puzzled, never having seen so much money before. She suddenly felt at a loss.
0:9:37|0:9:42|[Uncle Cheng] holds a stack of banknotes in his hand, with a contemptuous look, as if he doesn't consider the money as money.
0:9:42|0:9:50|He smiled warmly, and [Mrs. Cheng] remained silent beside him as he pushed all the money directly in front of her.
0:9:50|0:9:54|A pair of hands with calluses, showing the signs of years of weathering.
0:9:54|0:9:57|Father Cheng noticed the dilemma on his wife's face and spoke up.
0:10:0|0:10:12|This time, Cheng's [Mother] couldn't hold back anymore. Her brows furrowed tightly, and a tear suddenly flashed in her eyes. The skin, weathered by years of wind and sun, was lined with wrinkles, and her sagging cheeks formed distinct smile lines.
0:10:12|0:10:16|Facing this situation, she choked up and managed to squeeze out a few words.
0:10:26|0:10:31|As soon as the words fell, she began to cry loudly, wiping away a few tears with one hand covering her face.
0:10:31|0:10:37|Perhaps thinking of being alone in the house for most of the year, now finally seeing a glimmer of hope.
0:10:37|0:10:39|Seeing her like this, Cheng [Father] comforted her softly.
0:10:46|0:10:51|Mother Cheng's chin slightly tucked in at this moment, and her sense of grievance reached its peak in an instant.
0:11:1|0:11:5|The couple remained silent, but their hearts were as clear as a mirror.
0:11:5|0:11:12|Cheng [Father] took out a matchbox to light a cigarette, while the steam rising from the burning firewood behind him continued to surge in the dark.
0:11:12|0:11:20|With a flick and a puff, the smooth and continuous movements are no different from an old smoker, the drifting smoke rings floating in the air, [Mrs. Cheng]'s face slowly becoming blurred.
0:11:21|0:11:26|In the midst of the swirling smoke, tears streamed down [Mother Cheng]'s face, her brows furrowed in anguish.
0:11:26|0:11:27|Revealing pain and amnesia.
0:11:27|0:11:30|So, [Uncle Cheng] gestured for him to also take a sip.
0:11:30|0:11:33|[Mrs. Cheng] took the cigarette and skillfully blew out smoke rings.
0:11:33|0:11:38|Uncle Cheng asked, and Aunt Cheng nodded carefully.
0:11:44|0:11:48|He saw only a few circles of smoke lingering, and handed the cigarette back to [Uncle Cheng].
0:11:48|0:11:51|At this moment, [Uncle Cheng] appears profound and serene.
0:11:51|0:11:55|Before long, a sentence brought the two back from their fantasy to reality.
0:12:3|0:12:11|[Mrs. Cheng] looked fearful and conflicted, avoiding her husband's gaze, while [Mr. Cheng] remained silent, just taking a deep drag of his cigarette.
0:12:14|0:12:25|At this moment, firecrackers and the noise of children could be heard outside the window. In the rural northeast, they would also smash a bowl filled with coins, symbolizing peace and prosperity. The children would then rush to grab the coins.
0:12:25|0:12:37|However, the hustle and bustle outside the window seemed unrelated to [Father] and [Mother]. Inside their own home, [Big Brother] was helping [Sister-in-law] with cupping therapy. Perhaps due to the biting cold, [Sister-in-law]'s rheumatism acted up again, as she was seen wrapping her exposed body with a blanket.
0:12:38|0:12:44|[Big Brother] lit the cotton ball and quickly pulled the can out of his back, forming craters of various sizes in no time.
0:12:52|0:12:56|While speaking, he doesn't forget to tap the fire pot and check it.
0:12:57|0:13:8|[Sister-in-law]'s helpless response made [Big Brother] look even more guilty, after all, it was his departure that left all the heavy burden on [Sister-in-law] alone.
0:13:8|0:13:16|Perhaps due to the tacit understanding between husband and wife, [Sister-in-law] sensed his self-blame. He slightly turned his head to signal [Big Brother] that everything would be fine.
0:13:17|0:13:24|Shortly after, [Big Brother] covered [Sister-in-law] with a blanket, and the two of them affectionately leaned on each other, their eyes filled with tenderness and sorrow.
0:13:24|0:13:29|Big Brother's forehead was creased with lines, while outside the window, the festive atmosphere was strong.
0:13:29|0:13:35|[Big Brother] invited [Sister-in-law] to go out together, so [Sister-in-law] reluctantly walked out onto the street.
0:13:35|0:13:39|Everywhere you look, there are scenes of children happily playing with fireworks.
0:14:9|0:14:11|On the road, they encountered a young man selling fireworks.
0:14:43|0:14:49|A group of spirited children surrounded the open space, all waiting for the centerpiece firework to make its grand entrance.
0:14:49|0:14:55|[Father] stood in the center of the crowd, fireworks lighting up the sky, at this moment he was the most eye-catching.
0:14:55|0:14:58|Just as the fireworks were lit, the children all jumped up excitedly.
0:15:4|0:15:11|As the fireworks faded away and the children's cheers gradually dissipated, the next morning arrived in an instant.
0:15:11|0:15:24|The first light of dawn brought this small town closer and farther away, the sky no longer so clear, with a thin mist enveloping the ever-changing tree trunks. Through the cracks between the mist, the mountains, forests, and buildings only revealed a faint sunlight.
0:15:25|0:15:39|There was no festive atmosphere like during the New Year, no lively exchanges and heated arguments. Outside, a thick layer of ice had formed, serving as a natural refrigerator. At the entrance of the [Cheng Family], neatly arranged cured meat hung conspicuously.
0:15:39|0:15:48|In the house, [Mother] is busy making dumplings, rolling out the dough, preparing the ingredients, and mixing the meat filling. These complex operations and procedures require time to accumulate and settle.
0:15:48|0:16:0|The rolled dumpling skin is as thin as a cicada's wings, gently wrapping the meat filling inside. Use a little water on the edge of the dumpling skin to stick it together, carefully pinching with moderate force to form a beautiful round shape.
0:16:0|0:16:5|At this moment, [Father] was smoking a cigarette, watching [Mother] busy around tirelessly.
0:16:16|0:16:20|Uncle Cheng took a puff of his cigarette and chatted with his children.
0:16:54|0:17:3|Yes, as soon as you planned for me, the first figure returning home appeared on the hillside in front of the house.
0:17:3|0:17:7|Second Son [Cheng Yuan] and his new girlfriend [Tian Ge] were the first to return home.
0:17:7|0:17:12|[Cheng Yuan] was admitted to the graduate school in Beijing, and this time he brought his girlfriend home for the Chinese New Year.
0:17:12|0:17:20|On the wide ten-mile long street, [Father] and [Mother] sat behind the carriage, not far from the hillside, was the newly built villa of the [Cheng Family].
0:17:20|0:17:23|[Cheng Yuan] pointed in the direction of the house, smugly telling [Tian Ge].
0:17:36|0:17:44|[Tian Ge] is dressed very stylishly, wearing a mink fur hat and holding the latest model camera, taking photos of a villa not far away.
0:17:44|0:17:50|[Tian Ge] is full of smiles and anticipation, [Cheng Yuan] sees the newly renovated home, which is obviously more magnificent than before.
0:17:50|0:18:1|He couldn't wait to show his girlfriend around his new home, urging the coachman on. The horse galloped faster and faster, stumbling along the way, and soon the carriage arrived at the entrance of the new villa.
0:18:9|0:18:13|In the room at this moment, the silent elderly couple heard the voice of [Cheng Yuan].
0:18:16|0:18:21|Looking in the direction of the voice, [Uncle Cheng], who said not to come back, is more excited at this moment than anyone else.
0:18:21|0:18:25|[Mrs. Cheng] in her apron, immediately got up to greet the first son who came home.
0:18:45|0:18:54|Uncle Cheng turned his head to the side, with a look of resistance on his face, pursing his lips and looking a bit embarrassed. Tian Ge took a photo of them, then straightened his hat and paid New Year's respects to the elderly couple.
0:19:24|0:19:29|[Mrs. Cheng] enters the room with [Tian Ge], and [Mrs. Cheng] begins psychological negotiations.
0:20:2|0:20:3|The two walked down the hallway.
0:20:28|0:20:32|[Mrs. Cheng] is kind and gentle, but [Brother Tian] has been eyeing [Cheng Yun]'s family all along.
0:20:55|0:20:57|[Cheng Yuan] pulled Mother aside and asked quietly.
0:21:55|0:21:59|[Cheng Yuan] closed the door at this moment to prevent Father from hearing the conversation between the two.
0:22:25|0:22:40|Mrs. Cheng went back to the room, Mr. Cheng felt relieved. She knew that he must be going to persuade Mr. Cheng, so she turned around and hugged Brother Tian tightly.
0:22:40|0:22:49|[Mrs. Cheng] lit a pipe, only to have it extinguished by [Mr. Cheng], outside the door were the joyful voices of the young couple, while inside the house [the elderly Cheng couple] were filled with worries.
0:22:49|0:22:53|At that moment, [Tian Ge] walked into the room carrying a mattress, with a smile on his face.
0:23:16|0:23:18|[Tian Ge] helped [Cheng Yuan] lay out the mattress.
0:23:37|0:23:41|Saying that, [Father] helped him onto the bed and urged him.
0:23:41|0:23:44|[Uncle Cheng] leaned to one side, took a step, and lay down carefully.
0:23:48|0:23:58|[Susu's Mother]'s feeling penetrated deep into [Cheng Uncle]'s marrow. He stuck his head out and carefully observed this mattress. This wonderful feeling got him excited, and he chuckled with [Cheng Yuan].
0:24:55|0:25:2|[Cheng Yuan] shifted the gear to a higher position, catching [Mother] off guard and almost causing her to fall off the bed. Afterwards, [Mother] took out some snacks to treat [Tian Ge].
0:25:23|0:25:29|When it came to this point, [Father] took a puff of his cigarette, and smoke came out of his nose as he began to interrogate the young couple.
0:25:48|0:25:51|Uncle Cheng immediately showed confusion and puzzlement.
0:25:52|0:25:58|Upon hearing this, [Big Brother] felt a bit embarrassed, then shifted his gaze to [Cheng Yuan], talking about his own family.
0:26:25|0:26:25|When this was said,
0:26:25|0:26:39|The atmosphere instantly dropped to freezing point, [Sister-in-law] dared not speak, clearly looking towards [Big Brother], [Cheng Yuan]'s face was filled with tension and anticipation, while [Big Brother] could only casually flick the cigarette ash, everyone was waiting for him to speak.
0:26:39|0:26:44|He stood up, put out the cigarette, and as he left the kang, he didn't forget to kick [Cheng Yuan].
0:26:44|0:26:52|[Cheng Yuan] seemed to understand Father's intention, raised his head, and asked tentatively again. [Big Brother] impatiently replied, "What do you want?"
0:27:4|0:27:7|The Mother then ruthlessly closed the door.
0:27:7|0:27:11|At that time, [Big Sister] Cheng Rong's family was also preparing to set off.
0:27:11|0:27:21|[Second Sister's Husband] Ding Tu is a middle-aged bald man. Cheng Rong picks up a wig and puts it on Ding Tu's head. In the mirror, his wife's expression looks vague. Ding Tu scolds him.
0:27:21|0:27:33|Cheng Rong hesitated to speak, just continued combing his hair. Ding Tu glanced at him, Cheng Rong didn't answer, then forced a bitter smile, which made Ding Tu even more impatient.
0:27:40|0:27:44|Later, Cheng Rong and Ding Tu were stuck in heavy traffic on their way to [Father]'s house.
0:27:44|0:27:53|It turned out that they encountered a folk spontaneously formed drum team, a group of people dressed in various ancient costumes, waving fans, carrying lanterns, carrying burdens, and swinging hand frames.
0:27:53|0:28:0|The whole street was crowded with people, all common folks standing by to watch, after all, this was a rare lively scene of the year.
0:28:0|0:28:6|The gongs and drums are loud, firecrackers are popping, and [Father] and [Mother] are singing and dancing, along with a group of actors on stilts.
0:28:6|0:28:11|Stilt performers, each holding a fan, dance on the street after getting on stilts.
0:28:11|0:28:27|Not far away, Cheng Jia's [Big Brother] Cheng Zhi was also attracted over, along with his son [Younger Son] Nao Nao.
0:28:27|0:28:28|Cheng [Big Brother] happened to be out.
0:28:45|0:28:53|He saw [Nao Nao] and waved to him.
0:28:53|0:29:0|In the stilts team, it's really hard to find the other side. Facing the giants who are two to three meters tall, Cheng [Big Brother] still has to pass through them to find Nao Nao.
0:29:0|0:29:11|Cheng [Big Brother] could only pass through under the stilts, which were a pile of long wooden sticks. He even started dancing to the cheerful music, feeling no danger at all, just like a mischievous old child.
0:29:11|0:29:17|Finally reunited with Naonao after passing through the crowd, the doting Cheng [Big Brother] didn't forget to buy gifts for Naonao.
0:29:22|0:29:24|Nana leaned in close to his ear.
0:29:30|0:29:32|Sister-in-law spoke sincerely.
0:29:41|0:29:47|Turning around, at the back of the line is [Wang Mei], the wife of Cheng Zhi, a burly and fierce-looking woman.
0:29:47|0:29:51|Uncle Cheng lost interest all of a sudden, picked up his grandson, and walked back home across the bridge.
0:29:51|0:29:55|Nana sat on Father's shoulders, dancing to the rhythm of the Takahashi team.
0:29:55|0:29:59|The grandfather and grandson looked up and could see the makeup on the face of the actor Gao Qiao.
0:30:0|0:30:4|They immediately blended into the crowd and started swaying together.
0:30:4|0:30:9|The child who just said that his mother wouldn't let him go to his grandfather's house has now completely forgotten about it.
0:30:9|0:30:14|Uncle Cheng's face, which had always been stern, finally broke into a smile. Not far away, Cheng Yuan and [Mrs. Cheng] were standing.
0:30:15|0:30:22|Uncle Cheng is interacting with the actors, with a round and fair face, clear and bright eyes showing curiosity about things.
0:30:22|0:30:31|Grandfather and grandson were soon surrounded by the Takahashi team. [Mrs. Cheng] stood on the side, watching with great interest, hands clasped, brushing away the unhappiness of her children missing the New Year's appointment.
0:30:31|0:30:36|Tian Ge also joined them, casually picking up the camera and starting to operate it, while also picking up a fan to interact with them.
0:30:50|0:30:54|Cheng [Mother] covered her mouth, laughing heartily.
0:30:54|0:30:58|At this moment, the fierce and evil Wang Mei is planning to intercept Cheng Zhi on his way to visit the family.
0:30:58|0:31:5|He followed all the way and finally caught up with [Cheng Zhi].
0:31:18|0:31:23|Chengzhi and [Wang Mei] are riding their bicycles back.
0:31:23|0:31:25|At this moment, [Nao Nao] is learning to ride a bicycle.
0:31:44|0:31:52|[Mrs. Cheng] complained with a sense of grievance, but could only swallow her anger, because at this moment [Wang Mei] was approaching them.
0:32:10|0:32:22|[Madame Cheng] was disheveled in the wind, [Mr. Cheng] had long disappeared, and behind them, [Wang Mei] was staring at them intently, with a contemptuous and angry expression on her face, then she gave [Cheng Zhi] a shove.
0:32:27|0:32:33|After finishing speaking, [Cheng Zhi] could only timidly follow him and continue on the way to find his parents-in-law.
0:32:33|0:32:39|[Wang Mei] clung to [Cheng Zhi] all the way, while also being affectionate, which really puzzled people.
0:32:39|0:32:43|He came up behind [Second Brother and Second Sister-in-law], reluctantly speaking.
0:32:57|0:32:59|Nana mistakenly thought that it was [Wang Mei] who wanted to take her home.
0:33:29|0:33:32|As soon as the words fell, Father turned the car around and headed home without looking back.
0:33:32|0:33:35|Shortly after, [Big Brother] and his family arrived.
0:33:35|0:33:42|In the car, [Sister-in-law] was anxiously thinking about something, when her husband [Big Brother] spoke up.
0:33:42|0:33:46|Halfway, they met [Second Brother] and [Second Brother's Friend], and [Big Brother] immediately asked the driver to stop the car.
0:33:49|0:33:52|They got off the car and warmly greeted each other.
0:34:51|0:34:58|At the end of the conversation, [Big Brother] still held onto [Second Brother]'s hand for a long time, and only got on the car and left after being urged by [Second Brother's Friend].
0:35:7|0:35:21|While walking, he waved his hand, and after the hustle and bustle of the car passed, the film of [Big Brother]'s family, starring [Younger Son] Cheng Yong, had just ended. The staff were urging the last remaining audience members to leave.
0:35:21|0:35:26|That's Younger Son Cheng Yong and his girlfriend Younger Son's Girlfriend.
0:35:35|0:35:40|Coming out of the cinema, [Younger Son's Girlfriend] was still half asleep, in a daze.
0:35:40|0:35:43|Cheng Yong zips up his jacket while holding onto [Xiao Feng].
0:35:43|0:35:54|[Xiao Feng] yawned deeply and lazily leaned against Cheng Yong.
0:35:54|0:35:56|Cheng Yong took the hat and the two of them got into the car.
0:35:56|0:36:1|At the gate of the Cheng family, two women were shoveling snow into a snow pile, which is a natural refrigerator unique to Northeast China.
0:36:4|0:36:14|Mrs. Cheng patted her pants leg as she spoke, and [Wang Mei] wanted to help support her and continue to flatter her.
0:37:34|0:37:43|Mother's words struck Cheng Rong's heart, and his expression began to look aggrieved.
0:37:43|0:37:55|Entered the room, [Mother] led him back to the room to sit down, intending to question him thoroughly.
0:37:55|0:38:1|Mrs. Cheng put away the wine, only to find that Mr. Cheng's hands were unusually cold, which may be a sign of physical weakness.
0:38:27|0:38:33|[Wang Mei] seemed to know Ding Tu's secrets, making Ding Tu flustered. [Wang Mei]'s expression became even more animated.
0:38:42|0:38:49|[Mrs. Cheng] is inviting [Cheng Rong] to experience the massage parlor. She gestures for [Cheng Rong] to come closer, and [Cheng Rong] smiles and politely declines.
0:38:49|0:38:53|Unexpectedly, the conversation from the neighboring kitchen reached his ears.
0:40:0|0:40:17|Ding Tu gestured to [Cheng Rong] when he wasn't paying attention, signaling him not to speak out of turn.
0:40:17|0:40:23|Hearing this, [Wang Mei] felt jealous and started a fight with her husband [Cheng Zhi], snatching the book from his hand.
0:40:30|0:40:33|On the other side, [Uncle Cheng] and [Naonao] are skiing, having a great time.
0:40:50|0:40:54|The grandfather and grandson take big strides on the snowy ground, enjoying the sense of freedom between heaven and earth.
0:40:54|0:41:2|At this moment, [Cheng Yong] and [Xiao Feng] were dozing off in the car, which happened to be parked in front of the [Cheng family] house. They coincidentally met [Uncle Cheng] bringing [Nao Nao] home.
0:42:44|0:42:49|[Younger Son] Cheng Yong ignored advice, so [Mother Cheng] had to lean against the window and sneak a peek inside.
0:42:49|0:42:58|[Mrs. Cheng] couldn't resist [Younger Son]'s demands, stomping her feet in frustration, then massaging her back and stretching outside the door, perhaps triggered by an old ailment.
0:42:58|0:43:1|Before leaving, he couldn't help but sneak a glance at her in the net.
0:43:1|0:43:4|Before long, Nao Nao and [Father] also returned home.
0:44:49|0:44:54|Cheng Yong got up slowly and opened the door. [Father] immediately started scolding him harshly.
0:45:24|0:45:34|Saying that, Cheng Yong rolled up his clothes and quilt and walked out, looking defiant, and still reminding Xiao Feng.
0:45:34|0:45:40|Seeing Cheng Yong leaving the room, [Father] finally walked out with relief. Back in the living room, [Mother] cautiously grabbed his arm.
0:45:45|0:45:53|After the two entered, Wang Mei sneakily peeked at the door, then pulled Big Brother [Father] Cheng Yuan behind her to whisper.
0:45:55|0:45:58|[Mother] closed the door carefully and said softly.
0:46:19|0:46:26|[Mother] watched as [Father] sat silently beside her, perhaps realizing she had touched a nerve.
0:46:26|0:46:33|Both of them fell silent for a long time. [Mother] slowly took out a pack of cigarettes from her sleeve, pulled one out, and timidly handed it to him.
0:46:33|0:46:36|Father unexpectedly faced Mother's goodwill,
0:46:39|0:46:43|Big Brother hung his head dejectedly, creating an atmosphere that sent shivers down Sister-in-law's spine.
0:46:43|0:46:46|She took out matches and a lighter, talking to herself.
0:46:52|0:47:0|Cheng [Big Brother] finally looked up at Cheng [Sister-in-law], with a frown forming a 川 character on his forehead, but Cheng [Sister-in-law] continued to calmly light a cigarette for him.
0:47:0|0:47:9|Cheng [Big Brother] took the cigarette, his eyes lowered as if hiding something, his mouth slightly twitched, looking a bit at a loss. He took a deep drag on the cigarette and slowly uttered a few words.
0:47:17|0:47:20|Ding Tu gently closed the door and asked.
0:47:52|0:47:54|He is really a skilled technician.
0:49:4|0:49:9|Sister-in-law Cheng put down the vegetables in her hand and left, Big Brother Cheng poured a glass of wine, and Ding Tu continued speaking.
0:49:11|0:49:13|Ding Tu gestured as he spoke.
0:49:28|0:49:32|Cheng [Sister-in-law] turned back at the sound, and the three of them listened as if Ding was telling a story.
0:49:44|0:49:52|The scene shifts to Qian Dachuan and their second daughter [Cheng Ping] getting ready to return to her mother's home.
0:50:16|0:50:35|The members of the construction team insisted on giving money to the couple Da Chuan, unable to resist the group, [Cheng Ping] had to get on the car. As soon as he stepped in, everyone tacitly put on helmets and started the motorcycle. In a flash, they all disappeared without a trace. After a commotion, they returned to Cheng's house. At this time, Wang Mei was gathering firewood and gossiping with Ding Tu.
0:50:40|0:50:43|Ding Tu continued to help him support the wood.
0:51:8|0:51:12|Wang Mei lifted the sawn wood and made way for him, while Bingtu gave way.
0:51:14|0:51:19|Meanwhile, Second Daughter [Cheng Ping] and Qian Dachuan's motorcycle team also arrived late.
0:51:19|0:51:24|They drove on the wide road and then reached the snow-covered hillside.
0:51:24|0:51:28|The motorcycles numbered around fifty or sixty, their roaring exhaust sounds echoing throughout the entire village.
0:51:29|0:51:34|Suddenly, Qian Dachuan's motorcycle stopped on the flat ground not far away.
0:51:34|0:51:38|After the car came to a stop, he quickly extinguished the fire, and the boss's wife [Cheng Ping] also got out of the car.
0:51:38|0:51:41|Qian Dachuan turned around, raised his hand to take off his helmet, and said.
0:52:22|0:52:26|Cheng Zhi smiled perfunctorily and continued flipping through the book in his hand.
0:52:26|0:52:30|Mother stared with wide eyes, continuing to search through Cheng Zhi's hair.
0:52:30|0:52:33|Mother's expression and tone are full of tenderness.
0:52:33|0:52:34|She asked.
0:52:43|0:52:46|Cheng Zhi completely ignored the concern of Mother Cheng.
0:52:46|0:52:47|Mother Cheng asked again.
0:53:24|0:53:27|On the other side, the dominant Wang Mei was chatting with Cheng Rong.
0:53:55|0:54:5|Saying that, Wang Mei dropped the cloth in her hand and sat down next to Cheng Rong. She was shocked to find two scars on Cheng Rong's face, so she lifted his hair to take a closer look.
0:54:5|0:54:12|Cheng Rong quickly pushed her away.
0:54:12|0:54:16|Cheng Rong felt guilty and glanced at her, but Wang Mei continued talking to herself.
0:54:20|0:54:25|Just then, [Cheng Yuan] and [Tian Ge] returned, and exchanged greetings with [Wang Mei].
0:54:55|0:55:1|At the door of the [Cheng family], [Qian Dachuan] patted [Cheng Ping]'s head, signaling him not to continue the stalemate.
0:55:10|0:55:12|Suddenly, [Chengping] froze.
0:55:12|0:55:19|It turned out that [Father] walked out of the door with [Mother] slowly, and saw their second daughter. [Mother] couldn't hold back anymore.
0:55:19|0:55:22|She pursed her lips, feeling a bit absent-minded and walking unsteadily.
0:55:22|0:55:25|From a few meters away, tears streamed down [Father]'s face.
0:55:36|0:55:44|[Mother] tightly hugged her daughter, too overwhelmed with emotion to speak clearly, only managing to utter three words with a sobbing voice.
0:55:44|0:55:52|[Qian Dachuan] stood awkwardly on the side, watching as the mother and daughter were finally reunited. The usually tough man was now too scared to say a word.
0:55:52|0:55:54|[Mrs. Cheng] lifted [Cheng Ping]'s face, but he looked towards [Da Chuan].
0:56:14|0:56:28|[Cheng Rong] and others rushed over when they heard the sound.
0:56:33|0:56:40|Mrs. Cheng remained silent, [Cheng Ping] glanced at [Qian Dachuan], and Mr. Cheng must still be sulking.
0:56:40|0:56:44|At this moment, [Big Brother] Cheng Zhi stepped forward to break the awkward silence.
0:57:8|0:57:16|[Cheng Ping] said as he walked into the room.
0:57:16|0:57:22|Uncle Cheng didn't even look back when he heard the commotion. Nao Nao had never seen Grandpa so indifferent, so she could only weakly say a sentence.
0:57:24|0:57:42|Just then, [Father] walked to the door, followed closely by [Big Brother] and [Big Sister]. Seeing no response from [Mother], he straightened his clothes, stared at [Uncle Cheng] intently, and tentatively called out.
0:57:42|0:57:48|Saying that, [Father] walked into the room, followed by [Mother] and [Ding Tu], all staring at [Second Sister] with a look of unease.
0:57:51|0:58:1|Uncle Cheng remained silent, everyone waited outside the door for him to speak. The wrinkles on his face became more defined, and Sister Chengrong couldn't bear to watch anymore.
0:58:8|0:58:10|At this moment, [Middle-aged Woman] came to find her husband.
0:58:10|0:58:13|She walked into the room and glanced back at her children.
0:58:13|0:58:18|Uncle Cheng is stubborn and cares about his reputation, and Mother Cheng knows it best.
0:58:18|0:58:23|Worried that her daughter's self-esteem would be hurt, [Mother] Mrs. Cheng spoke up for her daughter first.
0:58:40|0:58:50|Cheng Ping's tone was mixed with pleading and helplessness.
0:58:50|0:58:52|At this moment, [Mother] Mrs. Cheng also spoke up for him.
0:59:3|0:59:4|Facing the persuasion of the children.
0:59:4|0:59:8|[Father] Uncle Cheng remained indifferent throughout, not even changing his posture.
0:59:8|0:59:12|At this moment, [Younger Son] Cheng Yong woke up and quickly ran to another room to wake up Xiao Feng.
0:59:19|0:59:28|Xiaofeng slowly got up in a daze, poking her head out from under the blanket. Then, Ding Tu walked into the room and took out something from his hand, intending to give it to Xiaofeng.
0:59:28|0:59:32|She sneaked in while Xiaofeng was combing her hair, took out two round boxes from the pocket of her suit.
0:59:36|0:59:43|Xiaofeng shook off the person and ran out in a hurry, while Bingtu secretly placed two round boxes on the table.
0:59:43|0:59:49|In the house, the innocent Nao Nao didn't know what had happened, so he quietly whispered in the ear of [Mother] Mrs. Cheng.
0:59:51|0:59:58|Mrs. Cheng looked up and saw a few tears sliding down Mr. Cheng's face, forming a clear boundary with his dry skin.
0:59:58|1:0:3|Uncle Cheng spoke, his tone mixed with shock, as Cheng Ping's expression changed.
1:0:3|1:0:11|The other family members were all extremely happy. Cheng Yuan was the first to run out to inform Father Qian, who had been standing outside for a long time and was frozen.
1:0:12|1:0:16|Cheng Yuan ran towards [Da Chuan] in a hurry.
1:0:16|1:0:19|[Da Chuan] threw his hat and quickly led the motorcycle into Chengjia.
1:0:19|1:0:24|He had been waiting for this moment for too long, and the heavy motorcycle now seemed incredibly light.
1:0:24|1:0:29|Cheng Yuan helped [Da Chuan] carry things, and when the car stopped, [Da Chuan] walked into Cheng's house.
1:0:41|1:0:44|Uncle Cheng heard the sound and walked out of the room.
1:0:44|1:0:48|The road wasn't long, but Father's steps became heavier.
1:0:48|1:0:52|He stood still for a moment, then walked into the crowd.
1:0:57|1:1:4|The moment the words fell, a lively firecracker sound suddenly came from the roof, turned out to be lit by [Father] and [Mother].
1:1:4|1:1:15|Uncle Cheng's emotional knot finally untied, the family then took a group photo in front of the chessboard. After the laughter and joy, everyone rushed to the wedding sedan chair, and they all embraced each other.
1:1:15|1:1:21|[Cheng Ping] and [Da Chuan] then took out a coat they had prepared in advance to give to [Mrs. Cheng], who felt a little embarrassed as she held the coat.
1:1:41|1:1:45|Everyone praised [Mother Cheng] for looking good in her outfit, and then [Father Chuan] took out two bottles of wine.
1:1:55|1:2:0|Later, [Father] took out two pieces of fine fabric.
1:2:48|1:2:51|Uncle Cheng slammed the table, leaving everyone stunned.
1:3:1|1:3:11|Everyone felt puzzled and dared not disobey his orders, so they could only retreat quietly. [Middle-aged Woman] was still worried, afraid that [Middle-aged Man] would scold the Second Daughter again.
1:3:11|1:3:29|Mrs. Cheng closed the door and stood outside, struggling to tiptoe. Unfortunately, the window was covered with paper, so she couldn't see or hear anything. She had to take off her coat and leave. Inside the house, Mr. Cheng spoke first. Cheng Ping and Da Chuan then walked to Mr. Cheng's left and right, sitting with their backs to him.
1:3:32|1:3:40|Glancing back from time to time, the expression on [Mother]'s face was solemn and fearful.
1:4:0|1:4:3|Uncle Cheng immediately asked.
1:4:3|1:4:14|Qian [Dachuan] answered confidently.
1:4:14|1:4:17|Outside the door, upon hearing this number, [Sister-in-law] couldn't help but exclaim in astonishment.
1:4:23|1:4:28|Although everyone was sitting in the living room, they all unconsciously paid attention to the conversation happening in the room.
1:4:28|1:4:37|[Da Chuan] raises his hand and places it on the table.
1:4:37|1:4:43|[Da Chuan] couldn't stand it anymore, he suppressed his anger and replied.
1:4:43|1:4:48|Chong [Uncle] lowered his head dejectedly.
1:4:54|1:5:9|This speech left [Father] speechless, and he nodded in self-reproach, pursing his lips and pulling a bitter smile.
1:5:9|1:5:12|Cheng [Uncle] looked skeptical.
1:5:20|1:5:22|Cheng [Uncle] stood with nothing to say, his back turned.
1:5:22|1:5:26|Had to call in reinforcements.
1:5:26|1:5:32|At this moment, [Father] is examining the small objects in the living room, then he stands up and walks solemnly towards the room.
1:5:42|1:5:48|Uncle Cheng was obviously dissatisfied with [Ding Tu]'s answer, his mouth moved slightly, indicating disappointment.
1:5:48|1:5:51|[Ding Tu] swaggered out with his hands in his pockets.
1:5:54|1:6:3|In the living room, [Mother] got up, Xiao Feng couldn't help but laugh on the side. Seeing no movement in the room, [Mother] shrugged off her coat and walked unsteadily into the room.
1:6:3|1:6:9|In the living room, no one paid attention, everyone was doing their own thing, but she called for [Ding Tu] and he followed her in.
1:6:9|1:6:15|Inside the house, [Father] sat cross-legged, while [Big Brother] looked curiously at the new son-in-law, a gentle smile on his face.
1:6:32|1:6:42|[Qian Dachuan] didn't hide his feelings, [Cheng Dashu] just smiled and didn't say anything, picking up the cigarette box on the table and shaking it.
1:6:48|1:6:53|Chen Ping took out a match, gently struck it against the flint, and [Uncle Chen] lit a cigarette.
1:6:53|1:7:2|Later, Chen Ping passed the lighter to [Big Chuan], [Uncle Chen] took a puff of smoke and started checking the household registration again.
1:7:2|1:7:5|Uncle Chen's face, covered in wrinkles, broke into a smile.
1:7:17|1:7:28|Da Chuan was relaxed, and a small figure appeared, it turned out to be [Nao Nao].
1:7:28|1:7:39|[Nao Nao] happily takes the toy and the scene shifts to Mrs. Cheng asking about Ding Tu [Da Chuan]'s true situation.
1:7:52|1:7:59|Ding Tu carried the New Year goods, draped in a British overcoat. Before he went far, he turned back and called out to Mother Cheng.
1:8:10|1:8:18|With the promise from his mother-in-law, Ding Tu finally felt at ease, walking confidently towards the outside, occasionally looking back at Sister-in-law Cheng.
1:8:18|1:8:22|In the snowy field, [Father] is diligently chopping firewood for tonight.
1:8:22|1:8:32|[Da Chuan], tall and strong, split the firewood into two pieces with one swing of the axe, while the women inside the house were eating fruit and admiring the robust figure of [Da Chuan] in front of them.
1:8:33|1:8:41|Unintentionally, a hint of fascination appeared on the faces of the women, while [Father], who was focused on chopping firewood, completely did not notice the few women standing by the window.
1:8:41|1:8:46|In the kitchen, Mother Cheng is preparing the annual reunion dinner for everyone.
1:8:53|1:9:1|Wang Mei offered to help, which was very comforting, until she saw something in Mrs. Cheng's hand. She took a closer look and saw it was a gold ring.
1:9:1|1:9:5|Wang Mei shook the water off her hands and pulled Mrs. Cheng's hand over.
1:9:22|1:9:28|Mom, this is great. [Wang Mei] is holding onto Sister-in-law Cheng without letting go. At this moment, Cheng Ping goes outside and calls out to Big Brother [Cheng Zhi].
1:9:32|1:9:36|[Big Brother] hurried away, leaving only Dachuan to handle all the meat.
1:9:36|1:9:45|The two figures grew smaller and smaller, as Da Chuan deftly packed all the meat into the basket. The scene then returned to the kitchen, where [Wang Mei] was trying hard to conceal the gleam in her eyes.
1:10:20|1:10:23|Chengzhi left dejectedly with his hands behind his back and his head bowed.
1:10:23|1:10:32|[Wang Mei] began to talk about the store in a secretive manner.
1:10:32|1:10:37|Chengrong and Chengping are next door, both understanding Wang Mei's intentions.
1:10:37|1:10:48|Upon hearing the voice of [Wang Mei], Cheng Ping couldn't sit still.
1:10:48|1:10:49|Chengrong also joined the conversation.
1:10:55|1:10:59|Xiaofeng and Cheng Yong leave the kitchen.
1:11:23|1:11:36|In the next room, Cheng Yong brought in a radio to interrupt the conversation between [Wang Mei]. Cheng Yong turned the music up to the maximum volume, causing both Cheng Yong and Xiao Feng to cover their ears and flee in the end.
1:11:36|1:11:48|In the snowy field, [Father] was still diligently chopping wood, [Mother] walked into the house and exchanged a few words with him.
1:11:48|1:11:51|In the gap of the conversation, [Cheng Ping] walked out of the door.
1:11:55|1:11:56|[Ding Tu] took two steps forward contemptuously.
1:12:15|1:12:27|[Ding Tu] looked disdainful, showing no intention of backing down.
1:12:27|1:12:31|[Ding Tu] finished speaking and turned to leave, but [Qian Da Chuan] grabbed his British-style overcoat.
1:12:36|1:12:40|[Qian Dachuan] exerted a little force, and [Ding Tu]'s skinny figure was pushed a meter away.
1:12:40|1:12:43|His defiant expression was seen by [Cheng Ping] not far away.
1:12:43|1:12:49|[Cheng Ping] carefully walked towards the snowy slope, [Ding Tu] still caring for him.
1:12:49|1:12:53|[Cheng Ping] ignored it and just glanced back before walking straight towards [Da Chuan].
1:13:13|1:13:23|[Da Chuan] walked home with [Cheng Ping] arm in arm, while [Wang Mei] was lying on the kang cracking melon seeds, as if lost in thought. She casually spat out the melon seed shells onto the ground after finishing.
1:13:23|1:13:26|Just then, [Cheng Ping] arrived by [Wang Mei]'s side.
1:13:32|1:13:36|[Wang Mei] helps [Cheng Ping] take off his shoes while smoothing out the bedding for him.
1:13:53|1:13:55|Every night before going to bed.
1:14:42|1:14:54|Welcome, [Wang Mei] gestured for [Cheng Ping] to lie down, slowly bending down with her ear gently pressed against [Cheng Ping]'s belly. Meanwhile, in the kitchen, [Da Chuan] quietly approached [Cheng Da Niang].
1:15:31|1:15:36|[Wang Mei] just said "sorry" a second ago, and the next second she opened the box, exclaiming in surprise.
1:15:58|1:16:15|[Qian Dachuan] had a big smile on his face, took off his clothes and put them on the chair. [Wang Mei] watched him walk out of the room, touched the gold ring that couldn't be taken off with her hand, then leaned over to [Cheng Ping] and whispered, giggling uncontrollably, even jokingly patted [Cheng Ping].
1:16:15|1:16:23|In the kitchen, [Father] appeared to be the image of a househusband, bustling around in an apron, tending to the stove and chopping vegetables.
1:16:23|1:16:24|Middle-aged Woman stood behind and asked, "..."
1:16:28|1:16:35|Mrs. Cheng cracked eggs while chatting with Mr. Qian Da Chuan.
1:16:35|1:16:44|[Mrs. Cheng] paused for a moment, then added.
1:17:23|1:17:27|The [Big Brother] in front is chatting without forgetting to chop vegetables.
1:17:27|1:17:31|He looked up, his face full of gratitude and sincerity.
1:17:31|1:17:35|In the living room, everyone was lively and bustling, more than just a festive atmosphere.
1:17:35|1:17:41|Nana and Xiaofeng hung lanterns together. After the adults set up the round table, an action by [Wang Mei] caught everyone's attention.
1:18:24|1:18:27|In the kitchen, [Big Brother] is stirring the pot over a high flame.
1:18:44|1:18:52|Mom, let's have a peaceful and harmonious year this year, and set off firecrackers outside, the grandfather and grandson are doing it together.
1:18:52|1:18:56|Cheng [Father] always has a friendly smile on his face when interacting with his children.
1:18:56|1:19:3|Before long, the family gathered around to welcome the arrival of the new year.
1:19:3|1:19:6|Before long, [Big Brother] brought his specialty dish to the table.
1:19:10|1:19:16|Xiao Feng led the applause, brought Da Chun to sit down, and finally everyone was present. Cheng [Father] leisurely lit a cigarette.
1:19:16|1:19:27|When Nao Nao was about to pick up the dishes, [Wang Mei] moved her hand away and quietly reminded her.
1:19:27|1:19:28|Naonao agilely jumped off the table to pay New Year's greetings.
1:20:20|1:20:31|[Cheng Yong] took out a set of small landlord's robes for him to put on, along with a cute little hat.
1:20:31|1:20:34|Nao Nao kowtowed to everyone for half a year.
1:20:52|1:20:59|Naonao stood on the kang with a proud look, causing everyone to burst into laughter. At this moment, [Cheng Yong] raised his glass.
1:21:10|1:21:15|He paused, pretending to be relaxed.
1:22:8|1:22:13|[Ugly Mother-in-law] had a flush on her face, raised her glass and drank it all in one gulp, then covered her mouth and chuckled.
1:22:13|1:22:14|The two elders' wine glasses were just emptied.
1:22:42|1:22:56|He poured wine for the elderly couple, amidst a mix of worries and lights, [Father] held up his wine glass hand slightly shaking, [Mother] with a kind smile, [Father] took over the conversation and opened up his heart.
1:23:12|1:23:20|[Mrs. Cheng] watched anxiously from the side as the adults drank and made a ruckus. She took a sip secretly, and then [Cheng Yong] spoke up.
1:23:44|1:23:48|At this moment, [Cheng Yong] gestured for Xiaofeng to go to the room and get something.
1:24:7|1:24:11|[Cheng Yong] jokes around with everyone while holding a box with a national flag and the words "donation" on it.
1:24:18|1:24:21|Unfortunately, no one responded, leaving [Cheng Yong] feeling embarrassed.
1:24:23|1:24:26|[Cheng Yong] pointed to the comical donation box while speaking.
1:24:33|1:24:38|It's [Wang Mei]'s turn.
1:24:38|1:24:47|Da Chuan shyly offers a toast, while [Wang Mei] flatteringly raises her glass to him.
1:24:47|1:24:50|The three of them looked at each other and [Wang Mei] wiped her mouth clean with her hand.
1:24:50|1:24:54|Just as Dad was about to say something, [Wang Mei] interrupted him.
1:25:0|1:25:7|Cheng Zhi was drinking alone, and Cheng Yuan also stood up.
1:25:21|1:25:30|As soon as these words were spoken, the crowd began to discuss it. [Uncle Cheng] seemed to perk up, slowly exhaling smoke, and asked disdainfully.
1:25:50|1:25:57|At this moment, [Big Brother] stepped forward.
1:25:57|1:25:59|Cheng Yuan defended himself indignantly.
1:26:45|1:26:48|The two brothers started to argue, with neither willing to give in to the other.
1:27:7|1:27:13|Big Brother's originally kind face darkened, and Ding Tong spoke.
1:27:13|1:27:14|Cheng Yuan looked defiant.
1:27:31|1:27:39|Father's words had just fallen, and Big Brother's eyes, which were lowered, showed a hint of sharpness. The smile on his originally sun-darkened face couldn't be sustained, only pursing his lips.
1:27:41|1:27:50|Cheng Ping echoed in agreement, the wrinkles on Father's face becoming more pronounced. Everyone remained silent, and Big Brother, sensing the situation was not right, stood up first.
1:28:14|1:28:19|Father was seen holding an empty plate, rummaging through the drawers in the room.
1:28:19|1:28:23|On the other side, everyone watched as [Younger Son] got drunk and fell asleep in a daze.
1:28:23|1:28:32|Before long, [Uncle Cheng] came out carrying a plate filled with banknotes, placing it right in the center of the table. Everyone stared in astonishment at the money.
1:28:40|1:28:44|[Uncle Cheng] sat down heavily, not answering his question.
1:28:44|1:28:46|Everyone looked at each other in silence, no one dared to speak.
1:28:46|1:28:50|Only [Wang Mei] was staring at the money, licking her lips and blinking.
1:28:57|1:29:1|Speak up, [Uncle Cheng] picked up the wine and filled his own cup.
1:29:1|1:29:6|At this moment, there was a noise outside the door. [Middle-aged Woman] pointed to the window, indicating for [Cheng Yong] to go and open the door.
1:29:6|1:29:12|In the dark night, an old woman is seen standing outside the door, holding a basket.
1:29:25|1:29:36|[Ding Tu] walked out in confusion.
1:29:36|1:29:41|[Cheng Rong] heard the noise, abandoned pity and walked to the door, with a look of pain and unease in his eyes.
1:29:41|1:29:47|At the door, he caught a glimpse of [Cheng Rong] hiding on the side eavesdropping, while the old lady still remained kneeling.
1:29:47|1:29:48|Cheng Rong saw the situation and quickly helped him up.
1:30:21|1:30:25|Cheng Rong looked at the New Year goods in the hands of [Middle-aged Woman], which turned out to be prepared by their own family.
1:30:25|1:30:37|His chest felt as if it were being crushed by an invisible boulder, his mouth trembling uncontrollably, trying to hold back tears as he ran into the house.
1:30:37|1:30:40|Cheng Rong closed the door with all his might, and [Middle-aged Woman] let out a heavy sigh.
1:30:40|1:30:45|Upon returning to the room, [Cheng Rongyi] collapsed on the sofa and burst into tears.
1:31:7|1:31:9|And at this moment, [Mother] stood outside the door, at a loss.
1:31:14|1:31:17|Cheng Yong couldn't swallow this anger and started fighting with [Ding Tu].
1:31:17|1:31:23|[Ding Tu] in his former days of being well-dressed, was directly pressed to the ground and rubbed in the snow, while [Xiao Feng] watched on the side.
1:31:31|1:31:39|[Little Feng], who doesn't mind getting involved in trouble, wanted to help Cheng Yong. Unexpectedly, he jumped up, lost his balance, and the three of them fell into the snow together.
1:31:39|1:31:51|[Ding Tu] took the opportunity to press Cheng Yong and [Xiao Feng] to the ground. [Xiao Feng] cried loudly, and the three of them formed a human pyramid. Cheng Yong at the bottom was pressed down and couldn't get up, so he had to use the snow at hand to hit [Ding Tu]'s eyes.
1:31:54|1:31:58|Upon hearing such a commotion outside the door, [Father] all rushed out.
1:31:58|1:32:3|Qian Dachuan first separated [Ding Tu] from the two, then [Cheng Ping] quickly pulled up Xiaofeng.
1:32:40|1:32:43|[Ding Tu] looked down at the wig that had been pulled off the ground.
1:32:56|1:33:16|When Teng Yong and [Ding Tu] were about to fight, [Uncle Cheng] walked out of the house. The sound of him closing the door made everyone freeze in place. The angry voices and persuasions all stopped abruptly, as if the world had been frozen. He slowly walked down the snowy slope, hands behind his back, and bent down to pick up [Ding Tu]'s wig.
1:33:16|1:33:20|His suit jacket also shook as he walked up to [Ding Tu], then said.
1:33:26|1:33:34|[Ding Tu] took the wig and coat with a look of regret, then left without looking back, leaving [Uncle Cheng] standing there with a puzzled expression.
1:33:34|1:33:39|Inside the house, [Cheng Ping] had already cried into a tearful mess.
1:33:39|1:33:52|He took a few breaths and looked at [Mother Cheng].
1:33:52|1:33:52|He pursed his lips.
1:34:12|1:34:18|[Cheng Ping] raised his absent-minded eyes and looked at [Mrs. Cheng], she didn't say anything, just hugged her daughter.
1:34:18|1:34:23|At this moment, Big Brother [Cheng Zhi] walked out unsteadily, holding a glass of white wine.
1:34:33|1:34:42|[Cheng Rong] leaned on [Cheng Danni]'s shoulder, crying. [Cheng Danni]'s eyes gradually became dull and cloudy.
1:34:42|1:34:50|[Cheng Zhi] finished the white wine in his hand in one gulp, about to approach [Cheng Rong] to say something, but hesitated and went back alone.
1:35:18|1:35:25|At this moment, [Cheng Zhi] sat at the table, looking at the dishes on the table, wiped his nose, feeling really uncomfortable.
1:35:33|1:35:37|Shortly after, [Cheng Rong] walked straight out of the house.
1:35:50|1:35:56|[Cheng Rong] pushed away the hands of [Cheng Yuan] and [Tian Ge], and walked out of the house on his own, while everyone tried to stop him.
1:35:56|1:35:59|[Cheng Rong] walks down the snowy slope, [Wang Mei] tries to link arms with him, but gets shrugged off.
1:35:59|1:36:4|[Cheng Yong] and [Cheng Ping] stood on either side, about to reach out and grab his hand, but were also pushed away.
1:36:4|1:36:9|[Cheng Yuan] and [Tian Ge] were worried about him walking alone, so they ran forward, ready to send him back.
1:36:9|1:36:16|The scene shifts, with [Father] still holding onto the bottle of alcohol. [Mother] feels uneasy and quickly snatches the bottle from his hand.
1:36:22|1:36:28|[Wang Mei] starts searching the house for the dish she just made.
1:36:28|1:36:35|Cheng Zhi grabbed [Wang Mei]'s collar.
1:36:35|1:36:41|Father and Mother from the Cheng family rushed over to grab Cheng Zhi.
1:36:41|1:36:46|Cheng Zhisheng fought with all his might, but [Wang Mei] looked smug as she casually adjusted her collar.
1:36:49|1:36:56|Cheng Zhi, who had always been obedient, unexpectedly started a fight this time and gave him a loud slap in the face.
1:36:56|1:37:6|One wave after another, just as things were calming down, how could [Wang Mei] bear this anger? She grabbed the dishes and bowls nearby, smashed them on the ground, and menacingly moved forward, aiming to grab Cheng Zhi's hair.
1:37:6|1:37:12|Cheng Yong stood in front, holding his hands, unexpectedly Cheng Zhi wanted to scratch [Wang Mei]'s face by himself, pushing Cheng Yong aside.
1:37:17|1:37:26|It was clear that the adults' chaotic voices were of no use, disturbing Nao Nao who was sleeping next to them. He simply rubbed his eyes and went back to sleep.
1:37:44|1:37:47|[Wang Mei] was thoroughly enraged and started smashing things again.
1:37:47|1:37:51|Tired from the beating, she sat down to catch her breath, and Cheng Yong continued to provoke her.
1:38:2|1:38:16|Wang Mei, like a clown being toyed with, really picked up a plate and, amidst screams, completely smashed the mirror that only had a crack, along with the table of reunion dinner, causing the exquisitely framed family portrait on the wall behind her to tilt and fall.
1:38:16|1:38:21|After the curtain falls, this farce comes to an end, and the families disperse amidst grumbling and complaints.
1:38:22|1:38:31|The only [Middle-aged Woman] left standing in this mess, the entire ground is no longer accessible, making it difficult to find a place to stand.
1:38:31|1:38:34|At this moment, [Father] and [Big Brother] brought brooms to clean up, but [Middle-aged Woman] said.
1:38:46|1:38:50|Hearing this, [Chengping] and [Dachuan] exchanged a glance, remaining silent.
1:38:50|1:38:56|[Madam Cheng] slowly swallowed, looking at the leftovers on the ground, while the lantern on the wall still emitted light.
1:38:56|1:39:6|The next morning, a figure appeared at the entrance of the [Chengjia] house. He kept walking towards the outside of the door, his figure getting smaller and smaller, until he gradually disappeared.
1:39:6|1:39:12|Early in the morning, the [Father and Mother] decided to leave home. Before they left, [Mother] tearfully said goodbye to [Big Brother].
1:39:17|1:39:26|[Mrs. Cheng] was still wearing the coat that [Mr. Cheng] had given her. The elderly couple both looked back at the small western-style building from the carriage, then [Mr. Cheng] instructed the coachman without looking back.
1:39:29|1:39:35|[Cheng Daniang] still leaned on the railing and looked into the distance, unable to shift her gaze away from the home where she had lived her whole life.
1:39:35|1:39:45|Uncle Cheng didn't even look back, the carriage's figure gradually disappeared in this snowy landscape, blocked by layers of trees, making it even harder to see the trace of the old couple.
1:39:45|1:39:50|The [Father and Mother] of the family swayed on the carriage, while the small western-style building was slowly covered by snow and ice.
1:39:51|1:40:0|The originally magnificent walls were wrapped in silver decorations, blending with the surroundings. In fact, what [Father and Mother] looked forward to the most was this day of the New Year.
1:40:0|1:40:9|Especially after the big fight last year, this year brings them more anticipation. No matter what each person's purpose is, today the whole family finally gathers together.
1:40:10|1:40:16|This is the happiest day for [Mother], but in the end, only [Younger Son] had a good New Year in the whole family.
1:40:16|1:40:24|This absurd farce ultimately ends with [Mr. and Mrs. Cheng] bravely laying down their burdens and pursuing their own happiness in old age.
1:40:24|1:40:29|Although the plot is somewhat exaggerated, it realistically makes people dare not face it.
1:40:29|1:40:32|At the end of the story, there is a conversation between the [Old Couple].
