0:0:51|0:0:55|On a rainy day, [Ke Jianming] is being criticized by the boss.
0:2:8|0:2:12|The boss looked at the back of [Ke Jianming] as he left, and asked the secretary.
0:2:12|0:2:20|The secretary nodded innocently, and [Ke Jianming], upon learning that his wife was dying, rushed home in a state of extreme anxiety.
0:2:20|0:2:23|Unfortunately, the weather didn't cooperate as it started to rain heavily outside.
0:2:23|0:2:28|Watching the pedestrians with umbrellas on the road, he stamped his feet in anxiety and turned to the security guard for help.
0:2:40|0:2:46|[Ke Jianming] could only grit his teeth and charge into the rain alone, the pouring rain causing the streets to be flooded everywhere.
0:2:46|0:2:52|He used his arm to shield from the rain and dodged puddles as he ran towards home, finally reaching the bottom of the residential building.
0:2:52|0:2:58|A speeding car splashed him with water, making his already makeshift suit even worse.
0:2:58|0:3:5|Wife [Wang Yue] is sitting in front of the dressing table at the moment, concentrating on applying makeup, dabbing lipstick on her lips to create full lips.
0:3:6|0:3:10|Open your eyes wide and use mascara to brush your eyelashes thick and long.
0:3:10|0:3:13|At this moment, [Ke Jianming] braved the heavy rain and finally ran back to the apartment.
0:3:19|0:3:26|Without waiting for an answer, he casually said a few words and then hurriedly ran towards the elevator, pressing the button repeatedly, but the elevator did not respond.
0:3:26|0:3:29|Upon closer inspection, the sign on the elevator door reads:
0:3:33|0:3:37|He rolled his eyes in resignation and ran towards the stairwell, starting to climb the stairs.
0:3:37|0:3:40|He grabbed the handrail of the stairs and took big strides upwards.
0:3:40|0:3:42|Before long, he sighed wearily, feeling exhausted.
0:3:46|0:3:49|To save his wife, he could only grit his teeth and persevere.
0:3:49|0:3:52|Upon reaching the floor, he was already exhausted and his limbs felt weak.
0:3:56|0:4:1|He walked to the door gasping for breath, urgently knocking on the door and shouting loudly inside.
0:7:0|0:7:4|[Wang Yue] gradually calmed down as she watched [Ke Jianming] walk away.
0:7:4|0:7:7|She looked at her watch and said disappointedly.
0:7:18|0:7:21|[Wang Yue] muttered to herself and closed the door.
0:7:21|0:7:32|At night, [Zhao Kexin] and her husband [Yu Bin] were sleeping soundly when a phone call came in. [Yu Bin] groggily answered the phone.
0:7:32|0:7:35|The crying on the phone puzzled her, so [Zhao Kexin] asked her about it.
0:9:21|0:9:37|Please don't hesitate to like, subscribe, share, and support the Mingjing and Diandian programs.
0:10:27|0:10:29|[Ke Jianming] returned to the company after leaving home.
0:10:29|0:10:32|He sat in the chair, looking at the newspaper, feeling extremely tired.
0:10:32|0:10:35|Secretary [Meili] walked in with a cup of coffee and knocked on the door, warmly greeting him.
0:10:53|0:11:11|Ke Jianming didn't think much and casually replied. [Zhao Kexin] placed the coffee on the table, took off her hairpin, let down her hair, slightly shook her head, making her hair look more lazy and charming. She gazed at Ke Jianming with a hint of ambiguity in her eyes, then unbuttoned her coat, slowly took it off, and caressed her right shoulder with her left hand.
0:11:11|0:11:16|Pulling down the collar, exposing the shoulder, pouting the lips, and looking at the other person with a bewildered expression.
0:11:16|0:11:20|Ke Jianming, upon seeing the situation, widened his eyes and quickly intervened with a look of surprise.
0:12:10|0:12:15|Ke Jianming saw Zhao Kexin's sinister intentions and quickly dodged, seizing the opportunity to start running away.
0:12:15|0:12:19|The two of them chase each other around the office desk, with various situations unfolding.
0:12:19|0:12:23|In the end, Ke Jianming was finally pushed down onto the sofa by [Zhao Kexin].
0:12:23|0:12:30|[Zhao Kexin] passionately embraces Ke Jianming and starts kissing him. Despite Ke Jianming's struggles, he eventually succumbs to the gentle embrace.
0:13:6|0:13:11|[Zhao Kexin] took the script and grabbed her bag, then walked towards the director.
0:13:27|0:13:30|Several models stepped onto the stage and began their showcase one by one.
0:13:54|0:14:1|Filming officially begins, with [Yu Bin] discussing shooting matters with the assistant.
0:14:1|0:14:4|The Four Masters did not notice that [Helen] was watching them.
0:14:4|0:14:9|[Helen] looked at [Yu Bin], who was working diligently, with a smug smile on her face.
0:14:9|0:14:12|He set down his coffee and elegantly walked towards [Yu Bin].
0:14:12|0:14:18|He stood quietly next to [Yu Bin], and at the right moment, he bent down and whispered gently in [Yu Bin]'s ear.
0:14:40|0:14:45|[Wang Yue] hinted that she had arrived at the agreed location with [Zhao Kexin].
0:14:45|0:14:53|[Wang Yue] tied her hair in a low ponytail, wearing a bulky cotton coat, carrying an old-fashioned handbag, and arrived at the agreed meeting place with [Zhao Kexin], "You must be Miss Zhao, right?"
0:15:26|0:15:36|Seeing [Wang Yue]'s sloppy appearance, [Zhao Kexin] couldn't help but say.
0:15:36|0:15:40|[Wang Yue] looked bewildered and awkwardly adjusted her glasses.
0:18:12|0:18:16|Later, [Zhao Kexin] took [Wang Yue] to the gym to lose weight.
0:18:16|0:18:22|She looked at [Wang Yue], who was running on the treadmill with a determined look and covered in sweat, and then raised an inner question.
0:19:43|0:19:50|Encouraged by [Zhao Kexin], [Wang Yue] felt extremely confident and was climbing rapidly on the treadmill, only to fall down the next second.
0:19:50|0:20:5|The intense training by Gao Qiang left [Wang Yue] exhausted. She dragged her sore legs towards the sofa, carefully climbed up and lay down with difficulty. The pain in her body made her unable to help but complain.
0:20:9|0:20:15|He gently tapped his thigh, the intense pain making him unable to help but howl in agony.
0:20:15|0:20:21|He reached out his arm and picked up the phone on the coffee table.
0:20:37|0:20:41|[Ke Jianming] listened to the snoring on the phone, feeling increasingly uneasy.
0:21:36|0:21:40|[Ke Jianming] listened to the beautiful words and was enchanted, unable to resist reaching out to hold her hand.
0:22:17|0:22:27|At this moment, [Zhao Kexin] is leisurely watching TV at home. She takes out a cucumber from the vegetable salad in her arms and starts eating it. After chewing for a few bites, she finds it tasteless and begins to complain.
0:22:31|0:22:36|He turned around and picked up the phone on the table, happily calling [Yu Bin].
0:22:36|0:22:42|Yu Bin, who was eating hotpot, heard the phone ringing and quickly picked up the phone on the table to answer the call.
0:22:56|0:23:0|[Zhao Kexin] hung up the phone contentedly, and [Yu Bin] stood up to explain to everyone.
0:23:20|0:23:25|Helen reluctantly bid farewell to [Yu Bin], watching his departing figure before turning to the others and asking.
0:23:49|0:23:55|Early the next morning, [Wang Yue] woke up from bed, habitually turned over and reached out to the pillow, only to find it empty.
0:23:55|0:24:6|She immediately sat up and checked the situation.
0:24:6|0:24:11|She lifted the covers and got out of bed, then walked into the living room and looked around.
0:24:21|0:24:26|[Wang Yue] angrily walked back to the bedroom, looking at the wedding photo on the wall, and said.
0:25:28|0:25:38|[Wang Yue] opened the door and saw [Zhao Kexin], who was dressed in a low-cut top, arrogantly walking into her house. She intentionally lowered her neckline, showing off her well-maintained figure, and provocatively locked eyes with her.
0:25:38|0:25:41|[Wang Yue] asked in confusion.
0:26:18|0:26:47|Get out of here, you shameless person! Ke Jianming, you are despicable. You are not my match. How dare you bring this woman to bully me. I don't want to live anymore. I don't want to live anymore. [Wang Yue] gently holds her injured arm, feeling heartbroken by the damage to her beauty.
0:26:47|0:26:50|On the other side, Meili is picking out bracelets with Ke Jianming in the store.
0:27:5|0:27:18|Ke Jianming smiled awkwardly when he heard this, but what Wang Yue was thinking in her beautiful heart was that the next morning, she arrived at the park for a run. Seeing this, an old lady next to her said to her husband.
0:27:24|0:27:27|The elderly couple watched [Wang Yue] running away with great concern.
0:27:27|0:27:35|[Wang Yue] is wearing sportswear, running in the park with a flushed face and sweating profusely, panting heavily. The high-intensity exercise makes her feel completely exhausted.
0:27:35|0:27:43|She ran on the grass, her steps gradually becoming ethereal, her body involuntarily falling down, straight to the ground.
0:27:43|0:27:47|She picked up the glasses dropped on the grass and put them on herself.
0:28:1|0:28:4|She lay on the grass, pulling out a figure of pain.
0:28:4|0:28:10|The bright sunlight is shining on the spacious soccer field, where a group of young handsome men and beautiful women are dancing street dance.
0:28:10|0:28:13|They formed a circle and swayed to the beat of the music.
0:28:13|0:28:20|A middle-aged woman in a bright top and a scarf was also standing among them, happily swaying her body.
0:28:20|0:28:23|Young men are showcasing their own impressive dance moves.
0:28:24|0:28:39|They danced to the rhythm of the music, with the beautiful girls joining in and swaying their bodies along with the music. Auntie was also happily dancing along, when suddenly a phone ringtone interrupted her dance.
0:29:9|0:29:14|[Zhao Kexin] picked up a magazine to cover her face, secretly observing Cao Lan who was styling her hair.
0:29:14|0:29:21|Stylist Jing Zhuang also introduced her, and the dancing auntie had arrived at the hair salon at this time, doing her hair while observing Cao Lan.
0:29:44|0:29:47|Cao Lan, with her hair done, is about to leave.
0:29:47|0:29:50|Turning around, [Zhao Kexin] caught a glimpse of herself peeking.
0:29:50|0:29:54|[Zhao Kexin] saw the situation and quickly picked up the magazine in her hand to cover her face.
0:29:54|0:30:1|Cao Lan left with a smile on her face.
0:30:1|0:30:7|Cao Lan glanced at Dong Niang, who was doing her hair, but ignored her and went straight to the cashier to settle the bill.
0:30:13|0:30:18|[Zhao Kexin] looked at the mirror, watching Cao Lan had already left, touching her face with both hands, lost in thought.
0:30:23|0:30:26|Mother-in-law Zhao Kexin was stunned when she saw her daughter-in-law Cao Lan had already left.
0:30:34|0:30:38|The mother-in-law followed Cao Lan to the clothing store.
0:30:39|0:30:44|Mother-in-law saw [Cao Lan] busy paying at the checkout counter, quietly entered the store and hid in the clothes.
0:30:44|0:30:48|She looked worried as she watched the pile of clothes selected by [Cao Lan], glancing at the prices.
0:30:51|0:30:55|After Cao Lan paid the money, it was delivered to the door by the waiter, and she left contentedly.
0:30:55|0:31:2|The mother-in-law hid behind the clothes, observing the whole process, sneering at her actions, then quickly picked up her bag and followed.
0:31:2|0:31:7|Ignoring the strange looks from the store clerks, she quickly walked to the door, but did not find any trace of Cao Lan.
0:31:7|0:31:10|She stood at the door, looking blankly at the empty street.
0:31:10|0:31:12|The atmosphere suddenly became tense.
0:31:20|0:31:26|At the award ceremony for the Best Advertisement Film at the 9th Guangdong Advertising Creative Awards.
0:32:23|0:32:31|Tao Lan returned to her empty bedroom, exhaustedly collapsing on the bed, as her phone rang with a familiar tone.
0:32:31|0:32:36|She sat up in bed, picked up her phone and glanced at the caller ID before answering the call.
0:33:22|0:33:28|At night, [Ke Jianming] finished a day's work and returned home. After a simple wash, he went to the bedroom to prepare for sleep.
0:33:28|0:33:35|At this moment, [Wang Yue] was sound asleep in bed, her long legs exposed piquing [Ke Jianming]'s interest.
0:33:35|0:33:43|He lay on the bed, looking at Wang Yue's smooth legs, swallowed hard, and eagerly lay beside her, holding her in his arms.
0:33:43|0:33:47|Unexpectedly, Wang Yue pushed away from his embrace and leaned back against him, not wanting to leave.
0:33:48|0:33:56|[Wang Yue] pushed him away again, looking impatient, which made [Ke Jianming] suspicious of his wife's behavior and he turned and walked away.
0:33:56|0:34:5|Sensing something amiss, [Wang Yue] groggily wakes up, looks at the empty bed, rubs her eyes, and gets up to check the situation.
0:35:23|0:35:33|[Ke Jianming] left without a care for [Wang Yue]'s feelings. The more she thought about it, the more she cried uncontrollably. She then called [Zhao Kexin] to pour out her heart.
0:36:0|0:36:2|[Wang Yue] threw away the phone and burst into tears.
0:36:2|0:36:5|[Zhao Kexin] heard her crying and became very worried, quickly comforting her.
0:36:54|0:37:5|[Wang Yue] tightly grabbed her own neck with both hands, the strong sense of suffocation made her roll her eyes uncontrollably. She slowly released her hands, adjusting her breathing.
0:37:5|0:37:12|She had a sudden inspiration, changed her target, rushed to the kitchen, took out a kitchen knife, and walked out, rolling up her sleeves to reveal her smooth wrists.
0:37:14|0:37:19|Closing her eyes, she raised the kitchen knife in her hand, hesitated for a moment, but still couldn't bring herself to strike.
0:37:19|0:37:35|She choked back tears as she looked at the kitchen knife in her hand, then glanced at her wrist. Silently, she turned the knife over and lightly tapped her wrist with the back of the blade. The sound of a doorbell ringing caught her attention.
0:37:35|0:37:41|Upon opening the door, the couple [Zhao Kexin] and [Yu Bin] saw the kitchen knife in [Wang Yue]'s hand, and they quickly backed away in fear.
0:38:6|0:38:10|[Zhao Kexin] looked at the angry [Wang Yue] and couldn't help but feel upset, [Yu Bin] quickly tried to comfort her.
0:39:5|0:39:10|[Zhao Kexin] and [Wang Yue] looked full of anger, wanting to beat up the unsuspecting [Zhao Gexin].
0:39:10|0:39:14|[Ke Jianming] left home and then met [Meili] at the hotel.
0:39:14|0:39:17|The two of them were deeply in love on the bed, reluctant to part.
0:39:17|0:39:21|[Zhao Kexin] lit a cigarette and handed it ambiguously to [Ke Jianming].
0:39:32|0:39:35|[Zhao Kexin] and [Yu Bin] stayed with [Wang Yue] all night, getting ready to leave.
0:39:47|0:39:55|Wang Yue bid farewell to the couple Zhao Kexin with a smile on her face, closed the door, lazily stretched, and walked slowly towards the sofa.
0:39:55|0:40:6|She stood in front of the coffee table, picked up the plump oranges from the fruit plate, and prepared to start peeling them with her fingers, slowly recalling the advice from [Zhao Kexin].
0:40:16|0:40:27|She lowered her head to look at her full figure, decisively put down the orange in her hand, took out two small apples from the fruit plate, and smiled happily.
0:40:27|0:40:31|Wang Yue contentedly nibbled on an apple and began her weight loss plan.
0:40:31|0:40:35|In the gym, she sweats profusely, persistently exercising.
0:40:35|0:40:39|In the park, she is dressed in sportswear, taking off her glasses and running energetically.
0:40:44|0:40:50|The sweat after exercise, the gradually clear collarbones, are all the results of her continuous efforts.
0:40:50|0:40:53|In the gym, all kinds of equipment are at her fingertips.
0:40:55|0:41:1|In the mint villa, [Dong Niang] is in the living room, holding two large green onions in her hands, eating and dancing at the same time.
0:41:1|0:41:4|After carefully dressing up, [Cao Lan] slowly walked downstairs with her bag.
0:41:4|0:41:8|When the mother-in-law heard the noise, she quickly stopped and turned to walk towards the stairs.
0:41:47|0:41:49|Yu Bin pretended to walk angrily towards the window, [Zhao Kexin] quickly got up and walked to his side, comforting him gently.
0:42:35|0:42:44|[Zhao Kexin] picked up her bag, turned around and left. Her colleagues all burst into laughter at their desks, mocking her as Yu Bin walked out with Xiao Qu.
0:42:56|0:43:0|Yu Bin showed no mercy and went back to the team directly, then left empty-handed.
0:43:0|0:43:5|After [Zhao Kexin] left the company, she secretly called [Wang Yue].
0:43:5|0:43:8|As soon as the phone connected, she began to speak.
0:43:31|0:43:41|[Wang Yue] hung up the phone with a happy face, [Ke Jianming] walked in, [Wang Yue] heard the movement, her smile gradually froze, but [Ke Jianming] approached her with a flattering look.
0:43:46|0:43:51|[Wang Yue] took the flowers he handed her, looking at him coldly, recalling [Zhao Kexin]'s words in her mind.
0:43:56|0:44:0|[Wang Yue] looked up and felt extremely sad when she saw [Ke Jianming].
0:44:0|0:44:4|His cold gaze gradually softened, and he couldn't help but cry.
0:44:4|0:44:9|He held flowers, looked at the sofa behind him, and tears welled up in his eyes.
0:44:9|0:44:13|He gently embraced himself as he looked at the charming and alluring flowers.
0:44:13|0:44:17|Ke Jianming on the side looked at Wang Yue with a smug smile.
0:45:42|0:45:58|[Ke Jianming] walked to the desk, took out pen and paper, and started writing a letter of repentance. [Wang Yue] watched carefully beside him. In response to [Wang Yue]'s request, [Ke Jianming] showed disdain, holding the pen with a smug expression as he began to write. He already had a plan in mind, while [Wang Yue] closely monitored his every move.
0:46:43|0:46:47|Model are shooting, [Yu Bin] stands aside observing their performance.
0:46:47|0:46:52|Two models walked out confidently.
0:47:59|0:48:7|[Zhao Kexin] eagerly took the repentance letter from [Wang Yue]'s hand, and was shocked when she opened it.
0:48:41|0:48:47|The two happily entered the beauty salon, changed into comfortable clothes and lay on the bed, where professional beauticians began to massage them.
0:48:47|0:48:51|[Zhao Kexin] looked up at the ceiling and whispered to [Wang Yue].
0:49:24|0:49:47|Can I do it? Of course you can't, you will definitely mess things up if you go, you don't have his skills and reflexes, you will only cause trouble. Suddenly, Cao Lan's remarks caught everyone's attention, [Zhao Kexin] sat up from the bed, staring at Cao Lan with a murderous look in her eyes.
0:49:47|0:49:56|Cao Lan, however, remained indifferent. The intense atmosphere between the two was evident in their eye contact, leaving [Wang Yue] feeling somewhat at a loss amidst the palpable tension.
0:50:40|0:50:45|[Zhao Kexin] and [Wang Yue], after getting makeovers, came to the restaurant with Cao Lan.
0:50:45|0:50:49|Watching Cao Lan chatting happily with [Wang Yue], [Zhao Kexin] looked at the two of them warily.
0:51:47|0:51:53|[Zhao Kexin]'s words hit Cao Lan's sore spot directly. She looked at [Zhao Kexin] sharply, but the other person looked smug.
0:51:53|0:51:58|[Wang Yue] smiled at the two's childish behavior, but then looked surprised.
0:52:8|0:52:15|[Zhao Kexin] slowly turned her head and saw [Yu Bin] with a long-haired beauty, and she was stunned.
0:52:15|0:52:21|A wisp of blue smoke rose from the top of the head, with anger raging inside, shouting angrily at [Yu Bin].
0:54:4|0:54:10|[Ke Jianming] pushed open the door after work, cautiously looked around the surroundings, and was drawn to the beauty behind the screen.
0:54:10|0:54:17|[Wang Yue] is wearing a sexy and hot pajama, dancing behind the screen, her graceful figure curves are fully displayed on the screen.
0:54:17|0:54:23|Ke Jianming couldn't take his eyes off the slender arms, sexy small waist, and alluring long legs.
0:54:23|0:54:29|He walked slowly towards [Wang Yue], carefully approaching to check, and said mysteriously to [Wang Yue] in the night.
0:54:48|0:54:53|[Wang Yue] didn't answer his question, dancing as she walked towards the living room.
0:54:53|0:54:57|The lazy curls, graceful figure, still captivate [Ke Jianming].
0:54:57|0:55:4|He took off his suit jacket and casually threw it on the sofa, staring intently at Wang Yue dancing.
0:55:4|0:55:8|Then, he loosened his tie and danced along with [Wang Yue].
0:55:8|0:55:12|In the midst of confusion and infatuation, [Wang Yue] picked up a bowl of porridge from the table and fed it to [Ke Jianming].
0:55:26|0:55:31|[Ke Jianming] took the porridge from [Wang Yue] without any hesitation and drank it all in one gulp.
0:55:31|0:55:35|He placed the bowl on the table and gently wrapped his arms around [Wang Yue]'s waist.
0:55:35|0:55:40|[Wang Yue] had long seen through his intentions and walked up behind him with a turn.
0:56:29|0:56:35|[Wang Yue] slowly stood up and embraced the sleepy [Ke Jianming].
0:56:35|0:56:40|Watching [Ke Jianming] slowly falling asleep, [Wang Yue] gently placed him on the sofa behind her.
0:56:42|0:56:50|At this moment, [Ke Jianming] showed no response to the call.
0:56:50|0:57:0|After confirming that [Ke Jianming] had fallen asleep, [Wang Yue] started to search through his suit jacket. As expected, she found a key in his pocket.
0:57:0|0:57:6|[Wang Yue] saw the key and couldn't contain her excitement. After taking off her clothes, she took the key and went to meet [Zhao Kexin].
0:57:22|0:57:40|[Wang Yue] and [Zhao Kexin] happily drove away. Early the next morning, [Zhao Kexin] disguised herself and hid in the car, staking out [Ke Jianming] at the hotel entrance. She checked her watch, furrowed her brow, and stared intently at the main entrance. The long wait made her impatient, she sighed, but then the rearview mirror instantly snapped her back to attention.
0:57:40|0:57:44|He carefully observed the condition of his skin in the mirror.
0:57:44|0:57:53|[Ke Jianming] also walked out of the hotel at this moment, [Zhao Kexin] watched his movements with big eyes, then quickly used a hat to cover her face, afraid of being discovered.
0:57:53|0:58:6|[Zhao Kexin] kept a close eye on [Ke Jianming]'s every move. When she saw him flag down a taxi on the roadside, she quickly started the engine, prepared to set off, loaded her gear, and then began to follow closely behind to track him.
0:58:6|0:58:13|On the spacious boulevard, [Zhao Kexin] stared intently at the taxi that [Ke Jianming] was riding in, keeping a close eye on the taxi's movements.
0:58:13|0:58:21|To avoid being noticed by [Ke Jianming], he deliberately kept a distance and followed closely. At this moment, [Ke Jianming] had no idea that he was being tracked.
0:58:21|0:58:30|Ke Jianming walked into the hotel with a large bouquet of flowers, [Zhao Kexin] parked the car and stood at the hotel entrance, looking at the name of the hotel with a sense of foreboding.
0:58:33|0:58:37|Ke Jianming entered the elevator confidently, holding a bouquet of flowers.
0:58:37|0:58:41|[Zhao Kexin] is fully armed, always keeping an eye on his whereabouts, closely following the weather.
0:58:41|0:58:44|The elevator door opens, and [Ke Jianming] enters the elevator first.
0:58:54|0:59:0|Zhao Kexin, dressed in a hat and sunglasses from head to toe, appeared as usual, but Ke Jianming didn't notice anything unusual.
0:59:0|0:59:10|The elevator door slowly opened, and the two entered the corridor one after another. [Zhao Kexin] looked at him holding flowers standing at the door ready to take out the key, pretending to be calm and walking to the side.
0:59:10|0:59:21|Until the sound of the door opening, [Zhao Kexin] turned around to check the situation. Ke Jianming closed the door, and he quickly came to the door of the room, slightly bent down and leaned against the door to eavesdrop on the situation inside the room.
0:59:22|0:59:28|At this moment, [Wang Yue] was still dancing at home with full concentration. The phone rang, and she reluctantly stopped her dance.
0:59:29|0:59:31|The smile on [Wang Yue]'s face froze instantly.
0:59:55|1:0:4|[Wang Yue] was instantly flustered upon learning the situation, while [Yu Bin] was alone at home, taking out an ice cream and sitting on the sofa to watch TV.
1:0:52|1:1:12|Helen's heartfelt words plunged [Yu Bin] into deep thought. Cao Lan paced back and forth in the living room absentmindedly, and her mother-in-law quickly asked what was wrong.
1:1:12|1:1:17|[Zhao Kexin] rang the doorbell with her backpack on her back, and Cao Lan, upon seeing her, opened the door with a smile on her face.
1:1:24|1:1:31|[Zhao Kexin]'s cold attitude did not affect Cao Lan, who warmly invited her.
1:1:31|1:1:36|The mother-in-law behind them was extremely reluctant to leave, very worried, and eager to find out the truth.
1:2:10|1:2:14|Mother-in-law was rejected at the door, but she didn't give up and started eavesdropping by lying on the door.
1:2:14|1:2:19|[Zhao Kexin] happily entered the room and the wedding photo on the wall caught her attention.
1:2:19|1:2:22|The smile on her face disappeared in an instant, as she pretended to speak calmly.
1:3:20|1:3:29|Outside the door, the mother-in-law was completely confused. Inside the house, [Zhao Kexin] slowly turned around and suddenly raised her right hand, gently slapping Cao Lan's face.
1:4:29|1:4:32|In the bar, [Yu Bin] is drinking with Helen.
1:4:32|1:4:35|His eyes were wandering and uncertain, showing a sense of confusion.
1:4:35|1:4:40|Helen across from him is looking at him affectionately and saying to him gently.
1:4:48|1:4:50|The two of them reached a consensus and raised their glasses together.
1:4:50|1:4:54|Helen drank the red wine and said to [Yu Bin].
1:5:16|1:5:19|[Zhao Kexin] was ready to leave with her bag when she was stopped by [Yu Bin].
1:5:52|1:5:59|Please don't hesitate to like, subscribe, share, and support the Mingjing and Diandian programs.
1:6:7|1:6:13|[Zhao Kexin] flatly rejected [Yu Bin]'s request, turned around and left the company without considering her feelings at all.
1:6:13|1:6:18|She drove to a lakeside, parked the car steadily, and then prepared to get out with her bag.
1:6:18|1:6:25|[Wang Yue] is waiting alone by the lake for her. When she gets out of the car, he warmly greets her.
1:7:21|1:7:26|[Zhao Kexin] nodded at him, affectionately placing her hand on his shoulder to comfort him silently.
1:7:26|1:7:29|[Yu Bin] came to a restaurant and was sitting at the bar drinking alone.
1:7:47|1:7:52|[Zhao Kexin] raised the wine glass in her hand and drank it all in one gulp, frowning and sighing.
1:7:52|1:7:55|[Wang Yue] and the two of them started to act after finishing the phone call.
1:8:18|1:8:25|[Wang Yue] watched nervously as he clutched his chest tightly, opened the door, while [Zhao Kexin] cautiously peeked in to assess the situation.
1:8:25|1:8:28|[Wang Yue] stood behind him, also looking eagerly into the room.
1:8:38|1:8:41|[Zhao Kexin] pulled [Wang Yue], who hesitated to move, into the room.
1:9:9|1:9:13|[Zhao Kexin] and [Wang Yue] heard the noise at the door and quickly hid on the balcony.
1:9:13|1:9:19|[Ke Jianming] and [Wang Yue] walked into the room, [Wang Yue] was shocked by [Ke Jianming]'s inappropriate behavior.
1:9:41|1:9:46|[Wang Yue] was itching with anger at the door, [Zhao Kexin] took out a video camera from her bag and gestured to [Wang Yue].
1:9:46|1:9:52|The two exchanged a glance, then [Zhao Kexin] opened the door and rushed into the room, starting a flurry of shots.
1:15:0|1:15:8|In the luxurious villa, [Zhao Kexin] is lying in bed asleep. She habitually turns to the side, only to find the space next to her pillow empty.
1:15:8|1:15:12|She woke up abruptly, touching the soft pillow, with a look of confusion on her face.
1:15:14|1:15:16|His face turned pale, feeling a sense of unease in his heart.
1:15:16|1:15:19|He lifted the covers and got out of bed, walking towards the living room.
1:15:19|1:15:23|Upon opening the door, [Yu Bin] was seen sleeping soundly on the sofa.
1:15:23|1:15:25|He angrily walked up and patted [Yu Bin]'s shoulder.
1:15:26|1:15:26|[Yu Bin] got up from the sofa and said coldly.
1:16:48|1:16:51|After [Yu Bin] finished speaking, he turned around arrogantly and left, leaving [Zhao Kexin] alone to reflect, unable to come back to her senses for a long time.
1:19:54|1:19:59|[Ke Jianming] looked at [Wang Yue], who was so firm in her attitude, and had to walk out of the house with his own clothes.
1:20:1|1:20:6|[Ke Jianming] heard a loud closing door, sighed thoughtfully, and then left.
1:20:6|1:20:13|[Wang Yue] leaned against the wall in a daze, tears streaming down her face as she heard no more movement outside the door.
1:20:13|1:20:24|[Zhao Kexin] entered the company and saw the employees whispering to each other. Curious, she approached to find out more, but the employees looked at her with guarded expressions.
1:20:24|1:20:28|Looking at everyone's strange behavior, she asked in confusion.
1:20:35|1:20:37|[Zhao Kexin] suddenly panicked and quickly asked.
1:20:39|1:20:42|At this moment, [Yu Bin] is leisurely drinking coffee at the bar.
1:20:42|1:20:45|He strode forward aggressively and asked [Yu Bin].
1:20:47|1:20:51|[Yu Bin] slowly stood up and looked at him with a serious expression.
1:21:1|1:21:4|Yu Bin turned around and left without any hesitation after speaking.
1:21:4|1:21:7|[Zhao Kexin] had the words on her lips, but didn't say them out loud.
1:21:7|1:21:13|After Yu Bin left the company, he arrived at the coast, where a huge cruise ship emitted a deafening roar.
1:21:13|1:21:16|A bell rang, and Yu Bin took out his phone to see a text message.
1:21:20|1:21:23|He put down his phone, furrowed his brow, lost in thought.
1:21:24|1:21:31|[Zhao Kexin] drove to a resort, parked the car steadily, opened the door, and began to search for Yu Bin with an expectant look on his face.
1:21:31|1:21:39|He jogged to the shore, looked around, but couldn't see Yu Bin's figure. He quickly started searching towards another part of the shore.
1:21:39|1:21:44|The setting sun's afterglow spilled over the sea, [Zhao Kexin] ran to the seaside, stood under a huge reef, carefully searching.
1:21:45|1:22:3|Yu Bin, who had been missing, was sitting on the fence by the sea, looking worriedly into the distance. A small car slowly approached the shore, catching his attention. He lifted his head expressionlessly and watched the direction of the car. The car came to a steady stop, and Zhao Kexin got out of the car.
1:22:3|1:22:14|He watched [Yu Bin] with a happy face, running all the way to his side. Seeing his lively figure, [Yu Bin] slightly smiled, turned his head to the side, while [Zhao Kexin] stared at [Yu Bin] intently and said.
1:22:14|1:22:15|[Zhao Kexin] was suddenly overjoyed, with a smile that she couldn't control spreading across her face, waiting for the answer.
1:22:45|1:22:48|His eyes darted around.
1:22:59|1:23:4|[Zhao Kexin] hesitated to speak, while [Yu Bin] stood up and prepared to leave.
1:23:7|1:23:9|[Zhao Kexin] finished speaking, my face blushed with shyness.
1:23:21|1:23:25|The misunderstanding between the two was finally resolved, and they embraced each other sweetly.
1:23:25|1:23:30|[Wang Yue] is wearing a sexy tight skirt, paired with black knee-high boots, getting ready to go out.
1:23:30|1:23:36|[Ke Jianming] was greatly shocked at the sight, then he excitedly ran towards [Wang Yue] with a bouquet of flowers.
1:25:15|1:25:18|The lively drumbeats made Zhao Kexin nod in excitement.
1:28:15|1:28:23|[Yu Bin] thoughtfully helped [Zhao Kexin] take off her coat, then joined everyone in the middle of the dance floor to dance happily.
