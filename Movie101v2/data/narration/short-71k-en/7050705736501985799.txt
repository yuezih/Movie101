0:1:0|0:1:14|In the northern ocean there is a fish known as [Kun], its size is unknown, perhaps thousands of miles. The scene is delicate as if made of silk, with chapters of the mythological tales from Zhuangzi's "Free and Easy Wandering" arranged on top, shining with scattered sunlight.
0:1:14|0:1:22|The outline of [Kun] is sketched on the silk circle, as if it is flying in the clouds and drifting in the deep sea.
0:2:42|0:2:55|With the voice filled with memories, the four characters of Big Fish & Begonia gradually appeared on the screen. The film officially begins.
0:3:51|0:4:21|This world has its own sun, moon, clouds, and rain, with picturesque mountains and rivers. The people living here are born with the ability to control different elements of nature, such as wind, rain, plants, water, mountains, fire, stones, as well as various animals and birds. The huge crane standing on one leg in the center of the lake helps protect the man with an extremely pale face below. On a rainy night with a clear sky, the sky and sea merge into one color, with a new moon hanging in the sky, and the Milky Way shining down.
0:4:21|0:4:26|The woman weaving by the shore laid satin on the lake, printing out the colorful stars of the world.
0:5:16|0:5:29|The two rode their horses swiftly, passing through the misty mountains together, crossing the crystal-clear lake, flowing through the lotus pond under the sky, and finally returning to the courtyard where they usually lived before the ceremony began.
0:5:33|0:5:39|The young children were playing and laughing, while the children participating in the coming-of-age ceremony lined up to enter the gatehouse.
0:5:50|0:6:9|Hearing his mother's call, [Chun] hurried over, while the boy [Qiu] who accompanied him had already leaped onto the top of the tower. Following [Qiu]'s gaze, they saw in the center of the tower, by the stone well, an old woman hunched over with a dragon-headed mask, performing a ritual.
0:6:41|0:7:13|With a loud shout from [Qiu] Granny, the water in the well boiled up suddenly. After a moment, a water dragon rushed out from it, flying around the building and then breaking through the thick clouds in the sky, disappearing without a trace. In the next moment, the water dragon burst out of the sky, with sparkling seawater converging into a ball and piercing through, getting closer to the building. The water ball became larger and larger, until it reached the edge of the building.
0:7:13|0:7:22|The colorful lights in the long corridor gradually lit up, reflecting off the edge of the water ball, shimmering like a dream.
0:7:39|0:7:46|Beside the well, [Qiu] Granny's hands holding the water ball were surrounded by twinkling lights.
0:7:54|0:8:18|Just as [Chun]'s mother Feng was still instructing her daughter, two little fairies appeared in the corridor carrying soup pots. They stopped in front of each household to offer the children participating in the coming-of-age ceremony a bowl of soup. Soon, the little fairies arrived at [Chun]'s doorstep. They pulled their arms out from their mother's embrace, and [Chun] took the bowl of shimmering soup spring and drank it down.
0:8:34|0:8:49|After saying goodbye, [Chun] walked to the edge of the corridor. She closed her eyes and slowly leaned her body into the water ball. Perhaps due to the influence of the hot spring, in the moment enveloped by the sea water, [Chun] took off her clothes and transformed into a dolphin as hot as flames.
0:9:0|0:9:23|Feng called back her daughter who was about to leave, choked up and continued to advise. Seeing her mother's tears turn into a dolphin, [Chun] stopped swimming and just floated slowly up to the sky with the water ball, back to the top of the building. [Qiu]'s voice slightly eased [Chun]'s inner worries.
0:9:23|0:9:32|When the water ball reconnects with the sky, [Chun] comes to the human world.
0:10:14|0:10:30|Upon hearing a noise, [Chun] turned back reluctantly, but it was just that one distant glance. She saw the siblings in the mountains not far away, saw the boy with small scars on his forehead and clear, gentle eyes.
0:11:0|0:11:18|The first light of dawn shines, the sea and sky merge into one, the siblings Chun and Qiu paddle in a boat under the dome of heaven, with ripples gently rocking the boat. The sound of the xun flute echoes like a song, attracting the dolphins of the human world to come and swim around the boat, causing the younger sister to exclaim in surprise. The older brother speaks,
0:11:19|0:11:40|Shortly after, [Chun] took a handful of fish bait and tossed it into the air. The dolphins, being spiritual creatures, leaped out of the water to compete for the food. Without saying a word, the boy took off his shirt and smeared the fish bait on himself. Instead of answering, the boy spoke,
0:11:42|0:12:11|Little sister reached out to her brother's eyes, settled her on the boat, the boy carried a bag of fish food to the bow and leaped lightly into the sea. He stretched out his arms and floated quietly, the dolphins, attracted by the scent of the fish bait, gathered around him. They gently pecked at the fish bait on the boy's body, and then called a large group of small fish to wrap him up, floating around him.
0:12:11|0:12:18|The boy gently stroked the small fish swimming next to the whale, and carefully scattered the fish bait from the bag.
0:12:19|0:12:36|On the boat, Chun excitedly watches the school of fish in the water while holding her dog. Under the water, Qiu waves a bag of fish bait, guiding the fish to swim and flip around them, until the bait is gone and the fish scatter.
0:12:36|0:12:50|The boy grabbed the dolphin's fins again and swam in the sea, feeling the dolphin twisting its body, creating numerous water currents around them. It felt like a gentle and long caress, making the boy feel extremely comfortable.
0:12:50|0:12:58|He kissed the dolphin lightly, feeling each other's cold lips, and suddenly the dolphin hurriedly swam away as if startled from this sea area.
0:12:58|0:13:11|The boy looked around with some confusion, and sure enough, a special dolphin that did not belong to this world was gazing at him from a distance, that was [Chun].
0:13:26|0:13:37|[Chun] tirelessly followed the boat of the siblings, gazing affectionately at the boy until the bright moon hung high in the sky, stars twinkling, and the sea water clear as a mirror, reflecting the scenery of the sky.
0:13:37|0:14:5|The so-called not knowing where the sky ends and the sea begins, the boat is filled with dreams pressing down on the galaxy. Inside the boat, the little sister lies on her brother's lap and falls asleep quietly. On the sea, [Chun] listens quietly as the boy plays the xun leaf, the sound lingering and circling the sea and sky. When the xun stops, [Chun], who was lost in a trance, finally snaps out of it. She senses that the sea around her seems to suddenly boil and churn incessantly.
0:14:5|0:14:33|Just now, thinking that the gate of the sea and sky will reopen tonight and she will return home, [Chun] reluctantly left the boy behind and rushed towards the vortex amidst the surging waves. Along the way, she saw many earthly dolphins entangled in fishing nets, wailing incessantly. [Chun] hurried forward to rescue them, but as a dolphin herself, she had lost her divine power and could only helplessly watch as those dolphins were hoisted into the air, leaving traces of blood in the seawater.
0:14:34|0:14:53|The cruelty just witnessed has left [Chun] in a state of panic. Ignoring everything, she swims towards the center of the whirlpool, only to collide with the protective net that separates the seawater from the vortex. The more she struggles, the tighter the ropes binding her body become. In despair, she can only howl helplessly.
0:15:8|0:15:37|Taking off his straw raincoat and bamboo hat, the boy took the short knife handed to him by his little sister, held it in his mouth, gently stroked her forehead, and then leaped into the sea, swimming towards the whirlpool. The chaotic sea wind caused the little sister's robe to wildly flutter, with torrential rain pouring down and waves surging beneath. On the cliff, the little sister gazed at her brother with bound [Chun], seeing the boy swimming towards her with all his might.
0:15:37|0:15:50|The dim moonlight made the short knife at the corner of his mouth appear extremely chilling. Startled, Chun began to twist her body and struggle frantically. She did not notice that with each swing of the boy's knife, a rope binding her would break.
0:15:52|0:16:19|Lifting [Chun]'s constantly twisting body from the sea, the boy peeked out and said, then he continued to wield the short knife, accidentally cutting [Chun] on the body. The sudden pain made [Chun]'s struggle more intense. The boy held his breath in the water, struggling to cut the last rope, but [Chun] broke free from the bondage first in the twisting motion, whipping the boy into the whirlpool with a flick of the tail fin.
0:16:23|0:16:35|In the almost tearful cry of Little Sister, the boy was swept away by the whirlpool, with water rushing past him like a raging wind. No matter how hard he swam, he could never escape from the whirlpool.
0:16:35|0:16:43|Not long after, the boy was sucked into the depths of the sea by a tremendous force and disappeared without a trace.
0:16:43|0:17:10|Upon regaining consciousness, [Chun] finally realized that the boy had just been trying to save her. She surfaced and looked towards the weeping little sister on the cliff in the distance. Then, she hurriedly dove back into the sea, following the whirlpool all the way to the seabed. The boy lay quietly on the cold giant rock, his hair swaying in the water, but he showed no sign of movement with his eyes closed. [Chun] hesitated for a moment, then slowly swam towards him, using her head.
0:17:10|0:17:20|Gently leaning on the boy, hoping to wake him up, but it was all in vain. [Chun] knew that she was the one who killed him.
0:17:20|0:17:26|This gentle boy. I don't know how long it has been, she picked up the ocarina that the boy usually blew, and swam out of the sea.
0:17:27|0:17:35|Little Sister frantically searched for her brother's trace on the rocks at the cliff edge. When she saw the dolphin carrying a xun flute, she cried out and shouted, [Chun], [Qiu], [Kun], [Ling Po], [Mouse Granny],
0:17:43|0:18:6|Watching the frail girl in front of her, tears streaming down her face, drenched in rain and seawater but completely forgetting about the cold, [Chun] felt her heart churn, her gaze dimming. It wasn't until the gate to the sea and sky was about to close that she returned to the watchtower with overwhelming guilt.
0:18:11|0:18:29|Wrapping her daughter in a towel, [Chun] brought her back home, but neither of [Chun]'s parents noticed the ocarina in her daughter's hand that didn't belong to the underwater world. Seeing [Chun] safely return to the courtyard, [Qiu] quietly left.
0:18:32|0:18:46|Early the next morning, [Chun] arrived at a dwelling in the mountains. Following the guidance of the phoenix on the treetops, she entered her grandfather's house. Picking up the beard that her grandfather had dropped on the floor, [Chun] asked, and her grandfather waved his hand.
0:19:24|0:19:56|The magpie gently placed Grandpa's long and neat beard back on the floor, the natural curves outlining the calm river in the underwater world, also indicating that he was about to embark on his journey home, bidding farewell to Grandpa. [Chun] arrived at the cliff closest to the sky like ascending stairs, sitting on the broken bridge, quietly blowing the clay flute, looking at the continuous mountains and the serene sea of clouds in front of him, recalling the boy in the human world who died in the sea to save a dolphin. The sigh at the corner of [Chun]'s mouth sounded even more mournful.
0:20:25|0:20:32|A walnut fell from the mouth of the Pixiu stone statue as it spoke,
0:20:42|0:21:6|Chun returned to the courtyard with hope. She lay on the bed, dressed neatly, and closed her eyes to feel the passage of time. As midnight approached, Chun got up, pushed open the window, and quietly stuck her head outside. The stars and moon of the night shone on her face like a light veil, making her look particularly serene.
0:21:6|0:21:13|[Chun] looked at the position of the moon to confirm the time, and saw dark clouds approaching, making a decision in her heart.
0:21:13|0:21:38|Closed the window, she took out the walnut from the dressing box, looked at herself in the mirror, [Chun] clenched her fist tightly, then extinguished the surrounding candles, left the room, carrying a lantern and a paper umbrella. [Chun] tiptoed down the stairs. She was responsible for giving camellia flowers to each household on ordinary days, and tonight she had found an excuse for herself to go out. The power on her arm was gentle and graceful.
0:21:38|0:21:45|Temporarily accelerating the growth of a crabapple tree, Chun picked up the flowerpot and prepared to leave, walking into the corridor.
0:21:45|0:21:55|In the quiet of the courtyard late at night, apart from the distant rumble of thunder, only the hurried footsteps of [Chun] remained. As for the words spoken by the pixiu today,
0:21:55|0:22:0|She was somewhat hesitant, but more of a mysterious anticipation.
0:22:0|0:22:6|Thinking of the boy who died because of him, [Chun]'s steps became more determined.
0:22:6|0:22:32|Dark clouds enveloped the hazy moon, dimming the night light. The fine rain gradually washed away the traces of [Chun]. Walking outside the courtyard, she opened a paper umbrella, hung a lantern on her arm, held a crabapple flower under the umbrella, and briskly walked towards the rising building in the dense rain. Without a word, she arrived at a corridor bridge, where [Chun] placed the paper umbrella at her feet and placed the flower pot on the railing.
0:22:32|0:22:49|After freeing up his hands, Chun quickly picked up an umbrella and carried a lantern as he ran towards the Risheng Building. As he walked along the small path between two enclosed buildings, the sky began to narrow, and rainwater flowed down the eaves in a delicate manner, making the rain here appear even more exquisite.
0:22:49|0:22:57|The windows of the two courtyard buildings were all dim, except for one room where a candle was still burning. That was [Qiu]'s room.
0:22:57|0:23:10|He was sitting by the window, enjoying the fruits in the flowerpot. He seemed to hear some noise, so he turned his head to look downstairs. When Chun passed by the window, he pushed the flowerpot in his hand out.
0:23:17|0:23:30|The sudden commotion made [Chun], who was already anxious, a bit annoyed. She glanced at [Qiu] by the window with displeasure, said nothing, and turned her head to continue on the road.
0:23:31|0:23:56|Watching his playmate, [Qiu], who was acting completely out of character, [Chun] felt a bit worried. He climbed through the window and hurriedly put on his clothes, then chased after him. Across the waist-deep fields, in the darkness, the lantern in [Chun]'s hand flickered faintly, drifting towards the deepest part of the mountain forest. [Qiu] silently followed behind him, stepping onto the long, ancient stone steps, crossing through the deep and lonely woods, all the way.
0:23:56|0:24:3|Arriving at the cliff top, the vegetation instinctively avoided this area where nothing grew, or rather
0:24:3|0:24:27|Avoiding the fierce stone statue at the edge of the cliff, there was only half of a broken bridge, with a small path sketched beside the mythical beast, but it did not add much liveliness. Encountering the misty rain tonight made it even more desolate. Holding a paper umbrella, [Chun] looked towards the other end of the bridge. Unlike the overlapping mountains in the morning, all that could be seen now was a sea of clouds.
0:24:27|0:24:51|As if recalling something, [Chun] shook the walnut in his hand. Before long, the pixiu beside him roared with laughter, and the stone eyeballs seemed to heat up like molten lava. In the darkness, it looked like neon lights from a distance, and the deep voice echoed through the entire mountain forest. The rustling of fallen leaves filled the air, and [Qiu], hiding in the bushes, couldn't help but cover his ears to resist the pain in his eardrums.
0:24:51|0:25:1|The mountains and rocks on this side are shaking constantly, while the other side of the cloud sea remains calm, as if separated by a broken bridge, each belonging to a different world.
0:25:1|0:25:14|When the sound waves dissipated, a small boat drifted slowly from the depths of the cloud sea overnight. The fairy rowing the boat was called Three Legs, with a third eye on her back, holding an oar in her hand. She heard laughter and welcomed the passing guests.
0:25:14|0:25:25|[Chun] didn't hesitate and stepped into the boat. Once she settled down, the boat, with three legs, traced out a path through the clouds and mist, drifting towards the edge of the sea of clouds.
0:25:25|0:25:31|On the cliff, [Qiu] stood alone in the rain, gazing up at the stone statue.
0:25:40|0:25:54|Through the thick haze in front of her, [Chun] arrived at a world she had never seen before. There was no ground here, the sea of clouds connected with the sky, appearing even more pure and rich.
0:25:54|0:26:20|It must have been when the celestial being was drunk and shattered the white clouds, with ink-black steeds weaving through them, creating layers of cloud waves. Before [Chun] could dodge, the clouds dissipated quietly like boiling snow. After who knows how long, the distant sea of clouds gradually thinned out. Under the sky illuminated by the hazy moon and shining stars, a pool of water, stirred by the wind, silently stood there like a rising tower.
0:26:21|0:26:37|The three-legged boat was moored at the shore, and when [Chun] stepped onto the stone steps, it disappeared into the clouds without a trace. As she arrived at the entrance resembling a rising tower, she only saw a lock on the weathered door, which turned out to be a fat pig snoring with a nose ring.
0:26:37|0:27:14|[Chun] shook the walnut in his hand, and the pig's head wrinkled his nose and woke up slowly. After opening the door, he fell back asleep. [Chun] took a step forward and entered, the room was dark, only the moonlight washed in. A slender figure, [Ling Po], carried a sedan chair and approached [Chun]. The person in the sedan chair half-opened the curtain and asked gloomily. Then [Chun] followed the sedan chair into a room. The person in the sedan chair opened the curtain and walked out. He was called [Ling Po], with a body like crimson blood.
0:27:14|0:27:38|Only one pupil, living alone in the northern sea, isolated like a guardian of the sky, [Ling Po] did not insist. She pushed open the box on the table, only to see bamboo worms wriggling inside. She reached in and pinched one out, took the worm's leg and held it to her mouth, lighting it as if it were a cigarette.
0:27:40|0:27:46|[Chun] thought for a moment before replying,
0:29:8|0:29:15|After listening to Chun's answer, Ling Po lowered her eyelids and pointed at the words on the book in front of her, as if searching for something.
0:29:30|0:29:37|After a brief exchange, Chun and Qiu prepared to head to the Tower of Heaven.
0:30:40|0:30:47|I remember his face, I don't know his name, I remember his eyes.
0:31:0|0:31:19|In the corner of the Tongtian Pavilion, [Chun] finally found a small fish with a small scar on its forehead, which was the boy's soul. In the secret room, [Ling Po] performed a spell, and a few strands of light flowed out of [Chun]'s forehead, turning into the appearance of a begonia flower. [Ling Po] said to her,
0:31:50|0:31:58|[Chun] pressed the fish tank against his forehead, as if trying hard to sense the boy's faint breath.
0:32:2|0:32:14|The next day, [Qiu] was holding the camellia left on the corridor by [Chun] last night, sleeping soundly, while the other [Chun] on the other side woke up early, holding the fish tank with a radiant look.
0:32:48|0:33:12|In a hushed voice, as a cold wind blew by, the flowers and plants that had just bloomed on the windowsill withered instantly. [Chun] quickly used her magical power to make them grow again. Ignoring him, [Chun] closed the window.
0:34:6|0:34:15|Looking at the place where the sea meets the sky, the tall figure, [Chun], softly called out the boy's name, then woke up in an unknowing smile, in the prime of life.
0:34:15|0:34:37|The girl entered adolescence, and after some time, the sky gradually darkened. Beside the phoenix, the mythical beast Bai Ze sensed something unusual when it tasted a drop of rain. Seeing this, the phoenix also drank the rainwater and exclaimed in surprise. After speaking, she stood by the window, leaning against the wall, gazing at the sky.
0:34:37|0:34:45|Revealing endless worries. As night falls, [Chun] lies on the armrest gazing at the fish tank with a vacant look, everything around him seems unusual.
0:34:45|0:34:54|She seemed not to care at all, her fingers flicking the surface of the water,
0:34:57|0:35:8|[Chun] gently played the pottery flute taken from the drawer, watching [Kun] swimming thoughtfully in the fish tank, creating ripples in the water.
0:35:14|0:35:49|Taking [Kun] out of the fish tank and holding him in her arms, they arrived at the corridor. [Chun] raised [Kun] towards the sky, and the small fish in her palm floated up and swam in the rain. Unable to contain her astonishment and joy, [Chun] crossed the fence and stood on the eaves of the second floor. It was late at night, with only the soft words of [Kun] breaking the silence. [Chun] danced in the wind and rain on the gravel, illuminated by the moonlight like a colorful lantern.
0:35:49|0:35:55|The raindrops fell on her delicate skin, creating splashes.
0:35:55|0:36:5|A pair of jade bi discs, winding with threads of divine power, beyond the sky, hearing the wailing of dolphins in the human world, [Chun] softly said to the [Kun] in her arms,
0:36:16|0:36:24|In the same late night, the same lonely person, [Qiu] waited for [Chun] to return to the room before leaving from the roof.
0:36:24|0:36:41|Day and night, [Qiu] hides secrets for [Chun], silently accompanying each other. As time passes, [Chun] and [Kun] grow up separately, waiting quietly for the reunion. One day, [Chun] excitedly opens the cabinet door, only to find the water in the bucket calm and [Kun] gone.
0:37:10|0:37:26|[Qiu] protected [Chun] from the attacking bats and they continued forward. They arrived at a large well, and together they pushed open the well cover. A strong, foul smell rushed out.
0:37:52|0:38:2|Many mice suddenly rushed out of the well, scaring [Chun] into shrinking back.
0:38:12|0:38:21|An elderly woman suddenly appeared, carefully sniffing the dirt-covered [Qiu].
0:39:6|0:39:16|In the corner, the mouse places the needle on the record, and the music starts playing on the phonograph. The old woman then dances with large strides on the ground, followed by [Qiu].
0:39:22|0:39:33|Finishing her words, she tore open the puppet's belly behind the curtain, and a swarm of mice rushed out towards the direction of the well.
0:39:40|0:39:45|The old woman remained silent, her withered fingers pointing towards the well, watching as [Kun] was brought up by the swarm of rats.
0:39:52|0:40:4|The puppet threaded the needle, sewing up the mouse that had just scurried back into its belly. Taking out a xun from her bosom, [Kun] weakly opened his eyes.
0:40:9|0:40:25|Silently facing each other, time surged and passed swiftly on the body of this fish from the human world. The little boy playing hide-and-seek is called Yin, the son of the Cloud Immortal.
0:40:28|0:40:48|Yin and his companions were playing around the courtyard, hearing about a play in the wilderness. They went to observe, hiding behind a broken wall and peeking out. They saw [Chun] and [Qiu] standing by the ancient well, looking unusual. Yin's curiosity was piqued, and he mischievously followed them. After the two left, he went to the well to investigate further, only to see [Kun] swimming and turning inside.
0:40:57|0:41:3|Leading everyone to the ancient well for inspection, they found it empty with nothing inside.
0:41:13|0:41:45|In the wilderness, [Chun] hurriedly carried a bucket with [Qiu] along the way. When they reached a pond, [Chun] looked around, stopped in his tracks, knelt down by the pond, took out the increasingly larger [Kun] from the bucket, and put it into the pond. [Qiu] noticed something behind him and shouted. [Chun] turned around and saw [Qiu] standing in front of an old coffin.
0:41:45|0:41:53|As soon as he stomped his foot, there was a hissing sound coming from the coffin, so [Qiu] stepped forward and pushed open the coffin, only to have a giant python suddenly dart out.
0:41:55|0:42:12|Before [Chun], the python rushed forward, and in the nick of time, [Kun] in the water leaped forward to knock the giant python away. [Qiu], fearing for [Chun]'s safety, threw himself at the python and began to struggle with it. The python, as thick as a bowl, twisted its body around [Qiu], who grasped the snake's head with both hands and fought back with all his might.
0:42:33|0:42:48|[Qiu] held the snake's tail, swung the body of the giant python, slammed it on the bluestone floor, killing it. However, as the blood surged, the snake venom had spread throughout the body. Eventually, exhausted, [Qiu] fell down. Seeing [Qiu] unconscious, [Chun] helped [Qiu] up on the back and then took [Kun] running wildly through the fields.
0:43:22|0:43:29|In the dead of night, as dawn broke, [Chun] brought [Qiu] to the Chaoyuan Building where Grandpa Pi resided.
0:43:53|0:44:18|Having sent her granddaughter away, [Chun] sat on a wicker chair, watching [Qiu] whose consciousness was becoming increasingly blurred. He untied his tightly bound hair, spread out his arms, and in an instant, a surge of divine power flowed through him. His clean long hair, like a torrent, lifted [Qiu]'s body up. A strand of hair wrapped around the wound on his calf, and the poison inside his body was drawn out, flowing onto the hair. Wherever the poison touched, it instantly lost its luster.
0:44:18|0:44:29|Soon, [Chun]'s body was completely eroded by the void, no longer as pure as before. The rescue continued until dusk, and [Qiu] finally woke up by the pond.
0:44:29|0:44:38|[Chun] sat still, watching the stone given to her by [Qiu]. Suddenly, a smooth light passed by, and the stone transformed into the likeness of [Qiu].
0:44:53|0:45:1|[Chun] stood on the building, looking at the joy of the two children from afar, and then came to the front of the Phoenix with endless fatigue, who was his deceased wife.
0:45:12|0:45:20|The next day, [Chun] pushed open the door of her grandfather's room after wading through the water.
0:46:21|0:46:42|Time passes slowly, as [Kun] grows up, the order gradually shatters, making this world more and more unusual. The god of spring, Ju Mang, looks at the snow falling from the sky, with infinite worries on his face.
0:46:43|0:46:50|On the top of the building, [Qiu] stood with ease, looking at the tightly wrapped [Chun].
0:47:45|0:48:0|Upon hearing the words of the old woman, which involved [Chun], [Qiu] did not hesitate and quickly made his way to Chao Yuan Tower. The pond in the garden was covered in snow and ice, yet the water around [Kun] showed no signs of freezing. Approaching the edge of the pond, [Qiu] looked at [Kun] who had just emerged and spoke.
0:48:2|0:48:11|After that, he picked up [Kun] and left. The cuckoos that originally lived here then entered the pond. He arrived at the back mountain and broke open the ice river, continuing to speak.
0:48:18|0:48:52|[Kun] naturally didn't want to harm [Chun], so he looked at [Qiu] with sorrow, then sneaked into the river. [Chun] staggered towards [Qiu] in the snowstorm and asked, pushing [Qiu] away. [Chun] walked towards the icy river, ignoring the cold. She took off the cloak on her body and jumped into the icy river. The water was dark underwater, before [Chun] could react, a dark current swept her into the depths of the icy river.
0:48:52|0:49:7|At this moment, a group of mice, coming from who knows where, held up Chun's clothes in their mouths and lifted her falling body. Watching the girl in front of her who was disregarding everything, Qiu finally realized that her good intentions had deeply hurt Chun.
0:49:7|0:49:33|He dived into the river in search of the missing trace, and kept searching until nightfall. On the other side of the frozen dark river, a group of mice led [Chun] to the old woman. This old woman, now known as [Mouse Granny], was banished to the mortal realm for violating the heavenly rules and was not allowed to exist in the bright sunlight. She now oversees the mice transformed from evil spirits in the human world. Any disobedience will result in self-immolation until death.
0:49:33|0:49:42|Guided by [Mouse Granny], the mouse took the ocarina from [Chun]'s arms and handed it to her.
0:49:46|0:50:2|After [Mouse Granny] left, [Kun] was finally released from the refrigerator and swam to the side of unconscious [Chun]. [Kun] gently nudged her with his mouth, and [Chun] finally woke up. She weakly caressed [Kun] and said, "..."
0:50:3|0:50:10|Watching the nearby group of mice swimming in the same direction, [Chun] continued to whisper while lying on the ice.
0:50:13|0:50:45|Following the group of mice ahead, one person and one fish swam slowly forward. The winter clothes were intricate, becoming heavier in the bone-chilling river water. Feeling the helplessness creeping on her body, even the hair of [Chun], frozen into ice crystals, [Kun] gazed with deep sorrow in his eyes in the river. The group of mice stopped on a cliff nurturing a young magnolia tree sapling. [Chun], on the brink of desperation, concentrated all her divine power on the palm of her left hand.
0:50:45|0:51:15|The radiant light emitted by the divine power almost made it impossible to see her palm. The young shoots in the stone crevices, influenced by the divine power, broke through the surrounding stones and soared into the sky. Four vines intertwined and entwined, quickly thickening to the size of a bowl. Growing continuously, in a blink of an eye, they appeared as if they were about to ascend to the heavens, breaking through obstacles and rushing straight out of the glacier. Another vine grew out, connecting heaven and earth, reaching down to the dark frozen currents and up to the snowy rivers. Rolling up [Chun] and [Kun].
0:51:15|0:51:17|Escape to survive together.
0:51:17|0:51:42|In the vast ice field, with desolate vegetation, a withered magnolia tree twists in the ice, its branches entangled like dead snakes. [Chun] uses her last bit of divine power to manipulate the branches, firmly tying herself and [Kun] to the tree. At the top of the hill, [Qiu] still searches with a lantern, faintly seeing a figure on the dried tree by the river. His face stiffens, and he quickly slides towards the water on the ice and snow.
0:51:42|0:51:50|Rescuing the unconscious [Kun] and [Chun] from the tree, [Qiu] carries them through the snowstorm, with miles of ice sealing the land.
0:51:50|0:52:20|In the desolate wilderness, [Qiu] had reached his limit. He gasped and roared like a release, the fluctuating divine power causing chaos in the surrounding snow and wind. A strong gust of cold wind knocked him over directly onto the ground, and he tumbled down the slope into the snow. [Qiu] struggled to get up, clumsily helping [Chun] into his arms. A walnut fell from [Chun]'s sleeve, which he secretly picked up and tucked into his own pocket. Then, supporting [Chun], he prepared to continue on their journey.
0:52:20|0:52:37|His bare feet were submerged in the ice and snow, the cold wind blowing his thin clothes. He wanted to leave quickly with [Chun] on his back, but kept turning back to look at [Kun], almost buried in the snow. He knew the origin of [Kun], and had witnessed [Chun]'s sacrifices and hysteria for this fish.
0:52:37|0:52:48|Hesitating for a long time, [Qiu] eventually took [Kun] with him, not for anything else, just to avoid [Chun] leaving him like today, facing each other with cold faces.
0:52:48|0:53:1|The sky was already dim, in an abandoned ancestral hall, [Qiu] placed [Kun] in the pool, lit a bonfire, then found some cotton clothes to wrap [Chun] in, sitting by her side, gently wiping away the ice crystals and dirt from [Chun]'s face with a handkerchief.
0:53:15|0:53:27|Glancing at the awakening [Kun] not far away in the pond, [Qiu] lowered his head and continued speaking.
0:53:37|0:54:0|It seemed that the heavens had heard his prayers. In the next moment of the ever-changing time, it switched to dusk. The winter snow stopped falling, the summer breeze gently moistened, the warm sun shone, illuminating the snow, shining brightly. [Chun] slowly woke up, but [Qiu], who had always been by his side, was nowhere to be seen, as if forgetting [Qiu]'s existence.
0:54:0|0:54:20|[Chun] turned her head to look outside the ancestral hall, strange sounds guiding her to walk out. A group of large fish resembling [Kun] were floating down from the sky, and the water [Kun] also seemed to sense something, leaping out and creating countless splashes, floating together with the group of large fish in the abandoned courtyard.
0:54:31|0:54:58|Unable to stop lingering on her face until [Kun] followed the big fish soaring towards the sky, she finally stopped and watched the fish that seemed to be going far away. Inside the courtyard, she called out foolishly as if she heard this shout. Upon hearing it, [Kun] bid farewell to the big fish beside him. They affectionately leaned their heads together, caressing each other's warm skin, expressing joy.
0:54:59|0:55:28|Then [Kun] bent down and floated towards the tower. Seeing [Kun] return, a smile filled [Chun]'s face once again. She continued to run towards [Kun] waiting for her at the end of the corridor. The tower was old, the corridor was in disrepair, and each of [Chun]'s steps shook the dust and snow. With fearless determination, she reached the end and looked at [Kun] floating in the air. [Kun] then gently lowered his head.
0:55:28|0:55:43|Let her climb on top of him, they closed their eyes and leaned on each other, feeling the warmth of each other's breath, twisting and dancing as they floated towards the ground. As the dream faded, [Chun] curled up in the blanket and looked towards the pool beside him.
0:55:50|0:56:18|[Qiu] leaned against the cold stone wall, listening to [Chun]'s whispers, then smiled and left, stepping over the stone steps that [Chun] had walked on, crossing the snow-covered forest, and arriving at the cliff guarded by the pixiu. [Qiu] clenched a walnut and roared, then saw a three-legged, oar-propelled boat coming to the edge of the cliff. The figure in the boat took off the hat, bowed to [Qiu] in front of him.
0:56:18|0:56:32|Facing the mysterious ferryman, [Qiu] did not appear too constrained. Sometimes she climbed onto the three-legged head, gazing at the boundless sea of clouds, and sometimes she bent down into the cabin, wiping away the dust and cobwebs left on the paper umbrella lantern by [Chun].
0:56:32|0:56:52|Soon after, he entered the room, where [Ling Po] was sitting at the mahjong table, touching the tiles and talking, and let [Qiu] in. As he walked into the room, [Qiu] spoke.
0:57:57|0:58:7|The words spoken were followed by actions. Just then, [Ling Po] transformed into a spirit cat and leaped down to vacate a seat for [Qiu], the old man who looked exactly like him across the table.
0:58:7|0:58:14|The other two old men must have been painted by the same spirit cat, for the amusement of [Ling Po].
0:58:18|0:58:34|Opening the cards, [Ling Po] chuckled and cast a spell, causing the cards and furniture around to transform into spirit cats and scatter away.
0:58:40|0:58:54|[Qiu] was slightly stunned upon hearing this, then reached out to look at the walnut in his palm. [Ling Po] also leaned in to whisper a few words by his ear, then chuckled and left, leaving [Qiu] alone in the room feeling desolate.
0:59:8|0:59:19|During their conversation inside and outside Ru Sheng Tower, they saw fireflies swirling in the unreachable sky, like the Milky Way drifting in the air, flowing directly into Ru Sheng Tower.
0:59:19|0:59:32|The scene shifts, and once again we see [Chun] sitting alone at the edge of the ancient well in the abandoned courtyard, quietly observing the alternation of day and night, the changing of the seasons, and the unpredictable fluctuations of time and space, while the figure of [Kun] has grown even larger.
0:59:32|0:59:43|[Kun], with a body of more than two zhang, has a horn growing on its forehead, its body like red blood, and its belly like a bright moon. [Chun] sits on its back, floating in the air, resting with closed eyes.
0:59:43|0:59:54|The gentle breeze and drizzle linger, with [Chun] stretching her body, swaying alongside [Kun], gentle as the wind, soft as the rain.
0:59:54|1:0:20|By the side of the building, [Qiu] strolled over, looked up, and saw [Chun] and [Kun] playing in mid-air, enjoying the spring rain without a care in the world. [Qiu] felt a sharp pain in his heart but couldn't find the words to express it. After gazing blankly for a long time, he suddenly left. In a daze, [Qiu] walked to the dark mountain and heard the sound of flowing water. Looking up, he saw a waterfall several feet high, reaching from the sky to the ground.
1:0:20|1:0:30|The majestic divine tree stands tall, with branches like fire, swaying in the wind. Its trunk hollowed out, a tavern hidden within, serving as the dwelling of the Deer God.
1:0:53|1:1:3|After a moment of hesitation, [Qiu] spoke up. The Deer God nodded without saying much, just nodded and placed a pot of wine on the table.
1:1:6|1:1:14|Suddenly, the sky roared with a strange change, and a thick mist and heavy clouds fell silent in the air. Between the mountains, a raging flood surged and swept in.
1:1:14|1:1:21|[Qiu] stood on the edge of the cliff, in front of the waterfall, roaring with drunkenness,
1:1:28|1:1:40|After saying that, he fell to the ground with a drunken and ragged look. Seeing the flood was overwhelming, the Earth God in the center opened her mouth and said, pausing for a moment before continuing.
1:1:55|1:2:1|Outside the building, [Ling Po] looked at the churning sea of clouds and whispered,
1:2:47|1:3:13|On the other side of the courtyard, someone hurriedly shouted. After learning about [Kun]'s whereabouts from [Mouse Granny], Hou Tu, along with deities like Ju Mang and Zhu Rong, led the remaining survivors to the abandoned courtyard to investigate. Zhu Rong used magic to knock [Kun] down from mid-air, and Feng spoke up,
1:3:22|1:3:47|Seeing the surging divine power in her mother's hands, [Chun] could do nothing but raise her hand to resist. The deep mother-daughter bond lasted only for a moment. The two stopped, but then heard Zhurong angrily saying, "Words are followed by actions." Two qilins appeared with a momentum of swallowing the sky and earth, rushing forward to bite the thorns and trees transformed by [Chun]'s divine power.
1:3:50|1:4:3|[Chun] and [Kun] were fleeing, but were intercepted by the divine power of Ju Mang. Just as the attack was about to take effect, a water dragon appeared and blocked the surging divine power.
1:4:22|1:4:29|With a loud shout, Chun's divine power surged towards the sky, causing the earth to split in two and the sea to pour down, creating a stunning scene.
1:4:57|1:5:15|Upon meeting [Chun], [Mouse Granny] flaunted the earthly ocarina in her hand with a sharp voice, then drifted away into the human world as she said. As she spoke, [Kun] struggled to fly and float within the water column, but could not make any progress.
1:5:15|1:5:30|When [Qiu]'s divine power dried up, the Dragon King mask fell from his face, the scepter shattered in his hand, and disappeared into the void. He was at a loss, and the gate of the sea and sky immediately lost control, with a mighty rush of water pouring down from the opening in the sky.
1:5:30|1:5:35|[Chun] and [Kun] were the first to be swept into the sea, drifting like withered leaves in the waves.
1:5:35|1:5:40|The gods present saw the situation and led the refugees to the high mountains in a hurry.
1:5:40|1:5:48|The camellia is lush, like a blazing fire, its roots entwined along the riverbank, standing alone in the apocalypse. When [Chun] is awake,
1:5:48|1:6:14|Before her eyes was such a scene, she was weak, lying on [Kun], and faintly said, looking up and seeing that [Qiu] had just cast a spell to open the gap in the sky, and the sea water poured into the human world, connecting this world and the other side. Wherever the eyes could reach, the old city, ancient roads, plains, forests, rivers, and low-lying areas were all flooded with seawater.
1:6:14|1:6:22|Only the mountains and autumn wind remain the same, [Chun] plucks herbs by his side to treat the wound for [Kun].
1:6:26|1:7:4|Just as [Chun] and [Kun] were embracing each other with tears in their eyes, a sudden thunderstorm broke out, lightning shattered the sky, and seawater poured down, forming countless water columns. The seawater poured back into the mortal world. [Mouse Granny] sat on the back of a crane, searching for survivors in the ocean. Seeing [Mouse Granny] coming to rescue, Tingmu in the water shouted, and the crane spread its wings, gliding over the water, picking up Tingmu's sister and flying towards the shore.
1:7:22|1:7:32|Amidst the rolling clouds, the water shimmered, occasionally breaking through the sky and pouring back seawater. Before long, the sky in this realm was riddled with holes.
1:7:37|1:7:42|Before the towering water column that connects the human world and the otherworldly realm, [Chun] said.
1:7:50|1:7:57|[Chun] couldn't help but urge, but saw [Kun] unmoved like a mountain, sitting in front of [Chun], taking on the surging waves for her.
1:8:8|1:8:27|Upon hearing this, Chisongzi's face showed reluctance, but she also deeply knew that what Zhurong said was not false. She then controlled the immortal crane and flew to the sky above the crabapple tree, while Zhurong condensed her divine power, turning it into several blazing flames that directly approached [Kun]. The flames galloped in the air like a divine dragon, causing the surrounding seawater to explode into layers of waves with each strike, creating endless ripples.
1:8:38|1:9:12|[Chun] looked up helplessly in the vast ocean, swam to the sea hibiscus tree, and slowly spoke, hands clinging to the roots. [Chun] continued to ask anxiously, deeply emotional. As if sensing the emotions, a violent storm suddenly broke out, causing hibiscus flowers and leaves to fall in the wind and rain. The tree trunk transformed into a blazing fire, starting from the roots, spreading to the crown, and enveloping the hibiscus in flames.
1:9:12|1:9:22|In an instant, amidst the sea and sky, only this place was ablaze with raging fire. In the blink of an eye, flames were seen blazing on the vast ocean, no longer resembling the appearance of cherry blossoms from before.
1:9:22|1:9:38|From a thousand miles away, a phoenix sees the fire like silk, riding the wind and waves to arrive under the tree in the blink of an eye, supporting [Chun] on its back, heading towards the airspace where [Kun] and Zhurong are located. At this moment, Zhurong pinches his hand as a seal, summoning three fire dragons to charge straight towards [Kun], who can no longer dodge.
1:9:39|1:9:53|At this critical moment, the phoenix finally arrived, closing its wings to resist the fire dragon. The phoenix, the king of birds, is transformed from fire essence and is not afraid of the scorching flames. Therefore, it used its divine body to shield [Kun] unharmed.
1:10:8|1:10:20|Hearing what Chi Songzi said, [Chun]'s grief was beyond words. At this moment, the sky couldn't bear the weight, bursting open a huge hole, and suddenly the sea water covered everything, stirring up countless huge waves.
1:10:28|1:10:50|The refugees joined forces to cast a spell, reaching out towards the towering mountain in front of them. They saw a shining divine power, transforming into countless vines of various sizes, spreading across to the opposite bank. Seeing the refugees in distress, the distant Chisongzi lost interest in the battle and controlled the immortal crane to return. Chun was also extremely worried, and thus said to Kun,
1:10:52|1:11:6|After speaking, the phoenix led [Chun] to fly towards the cliff. [Kun] hesitated for a long time, but eventually turned around and continued to float towards the sky. Upon seeing the return of the Red Pine Child on the cliff, the sister of the court shepherd ran up and asked,
1:11:13|1:11:27|Seen this, [Chun] was a little dazed, the day when [Kun] was patrolling, his little sister also called out like this, [Chun] spoke in confusion, their eyes met, tears already filled his mother's eyes.
1:11:28|1:11:36|Chun swung his divine power towards the vine. Seeing this, the remaining people glared angrily, and Hou Tu said,
1:11:40|1:12:6|[Chun] hid behind the phoenix and looked at her mother. She felt the rush of time passing by, seeing her mother looking tired and worn out. Her mother gazed at [Chun] from a distance, wiping away the tears, leaving only worries for her daughter. Unable to bear it any longer, [Chun] turned around and prepared to leave.
1:12:6|1:12:16|In the moment of hesitation, the sky shattered not far away, and the sea water rushed into the sky, falling into the water, stirring up huge waves one after another towards the cliff where the survivors were located.
1:12:20|1:12:48|Walking halfway, they saw giant waves like walls, blocking out the sky and coming towards them. There were no trees or rocks in sight, only the flowing water. Looking across the river, the destination seemed high, but not as high as these giant waves. The survivors were filled with shock and despair, with many feeling hopeless. They stopped on the vines, gazing out at the sea with sorrow. Seeing this, Red Pine led the survivors to resist with the help of those who possessed the power of water, delaying the arrival of the giant waves.
1:12:48|1:12:58|The vastness of divine power makes the laws of heaven and earth seem insignificant. On the day when the sky is collapsing, at the brink of survival or destruction for a clan,
1:12:58|1:13:6|[Chun] finally came to her senses. She wiped away her tears, controlled the phoenix to leave, and secretly made plans in her heart, silently reciting,
1:13:24|1:13:30|The narration stops here, [Chun] leaps off the back of the phoenix, burning all his divine power with a determination to die.
1:13:32|1:13:51|Grandma, transformed into a phoenix, hurriedly swooped down to rescue, only to see [Chun] enveloped in a different kind of divine power than before, shining with a brilliance as fragile as dried leaves, burning life as the cost, moving at a speed unmatched even by a phoenix.
1:13:51|1:14:14|[Chun] fell into the sea, the light on her body illuminating everything in the dark sea water. She swam towards the sea holly bouquet that had sunk to the bottom of the sea and turned into charred wood. Embracing the thickest roots of her grandfather, [Chun] unreservedly injected the surging divine power from her body into it, causing powerful vibrations that shook this world.
1:14:14|1:14:39|Even in the deep sea, the flames that can burn divine power are able to scorch the already damaged soul of [Chun], enduring the burning pain, [Chun] continues to continuously infuse divine power into the magnolia tree, until their own dilapidated body turns into vegetation and merges into the trunk. Sensing something, [Kun] turns towards where [Chun] is, only to see the magnolia flowers rejuvenated.
1:14:39|1:14:45|Suddenly, the heavens and the earth changed, and the dazzling sun pierced through the thick clouds, shining once again upon the world.
1:14:45|1:15:7|In the vast ocean, the roots of the begonia bouquet spread throughout this world, wherever there is a breath of water, whether it be birds, beasts, fish, or insects, there are begonia stems. Growing and ending under the begonia tree, [Chun]'s childhood playmate Tingmu is also among them, standing on the begonia tree.
1:15:13|1:15:30|At this moment of surviving a disaster, with all things lamenting, a woman's crying can be heard sorrowfully. It is Phoenix standing on the tree trunk, tears streaming like a spring for the deceased daughter. Looking up at the sky, wherever there are broken places, there are flourishing begonias, to mend the sky's imperfections.
1:15:30|1:15:43|At that time, in this world, the peony flower was the sky, the tree trunk was the pillar of the four poles, rejecting the vast ocean beyond the nine heavens, carrying the boat to the vast eight wilderness and four seas, holding up the sky.
1:15:43|1:15:52|Between heaven and earth, the begonias fall like fire, floating on the water's surface, drifting away with the waves, full of resentment and longing, tears and complaints.
1:15:52|1:16:4|[Kun] floated within the canopy of the begonia tree, emitting a mournful cry as it moved through the branches and leaves, searching for [Chun]'s whereabouts. Yet in doing so, [Kun] only added to the pain.
1:16:4|1:16:23|I still remember the past when [Chun] could dance on the corridor, breathe out fragrance, gentle as the wind, could sit on [Kun]'s back, wandering through the mountains and skies. But now, [Chun] has grown so much, like a pillar supporting the sky, while [Kun] can no longer nest in his arms.
1:16:23|1:16:47|Contemplating this, [Kun] plucks a half sea-buckthorn leaf, holds it in his mouth, and ascends the stairs, passing by the cliff bridge, the stone statues still standing. However, the once rolling mountains have now turned into vast oceans. On the boat, [Ling Po] seems prepared, reaching into her sleeve upon seeing [Kun] carrying the sea-buckthorn. She then speaks,
1:16:50|1:17:22|After speaking, a brocade pouch appeared in his hand. Opening it, a smooth strand emerged in the shape of a begonia flower, darting out and swimming to [Kun]'s side. It wrapped around the branch near [Kun]'s mouth, floated in the air to the broken bridge, then smoothly and subtly merged into the flower branch, twisting and turning to take on the appearance of [Chun]. As the sea breeze swept by, [Chun] woke up naked and unaware of the situation, only asking the approaching [Kun],
1:18:7|1:18:14|Upon hearing the words of [Ling Po], [Chun] sat on [Kun]'s back and spoke.
1:18:19|1:18:40|[Ling Po] whispered in a low voice, her lone eyeball on her face looking particularly eerie at this moment. Seeing [Chun] floating on the sea, getting ready to head to the Southern Ming Heavenly Pool, [Qiu] shouted,
1:18:48|1:19:9|Rescued [Qiu] from the water, the two sat on [Kun]'s back and traveled together. As night fell, the stars and moon shone brightly, casting their light on the riverbank. The two rested by a bonfire, with [Qiu] silently roasting a potato. [Chun] lay on a dry log, gazing at the endless starry sky, lost in thought.
1:19:52|1:20:7|[Chun] didn't answer, just stared blankly at the night sky. Seeing this, [Qiu] handed over the potatoes. Watching [Chun] chew the food, he gently said with his arms crossed,
1:20:28|1:20:48|Upon hearing [Chun]'s words, [Qiu] bent down, burying his face in his arms, leaving only a pair of eyes. The flames in front of him became sparser and sparser, until the scattered sparks extinguished, leaving only a wisp of faint and lingering blue smoke.
1:20:50|1:20:56|The two of them stood back to back, exchanging words. Suddenly, [Chun] said,
1:21:5|1:21:25|Upon hearing [Chun]'s words, [Qiu] tightly hugged his arms, trying hard to restrain his emotions from breaking loose. Tears welled up in his eyes for a moment, rolling down his tightly furrowed brows. [Qiu] trembled all over, each breath seeming to tug at his excited heart, until he finally crushed the lump in his throat.
1:21:25|1:21:52|He turned around, looking at the back of the girl he loved, admiring her delicacy and grace. Trembling, he reached out his arm slowly, getting closer, but stopped stiffly just before touching the girl's hair, as if time had frozen with him in this moment. As the morning light shone, Qiu ultimately couldn't confess his feelings, since the day he fell in love with Chun.
1:21:52|1:22:12|He is probably used to it, used to silently guarding by [Chun]'s side. He is a celestial being, barefoot with white hair, wearing summer clothes throughout autumn and winter, unafraid of the cold. But last night, he seemed to truly feel the most chilling cold, and the two continued on their way.
1:22:12|1:22:19|Standing at the edge of a bamboo forest, watching the floating [Kun] in front of her, [Chun] leaned her head on her arm, silently thinking to herself.
1:22:29|1:22:43|With such thoughts in mind, the group finally arrived at the Southern Ming Heavenly Pool. Here, boundless and vast, with only a cliff standing in the midst of the waters, witnessing the changes of the sun and moon, and the passage of time.
1:22:43|1:23:1|The current [Kun], though not as far as the ancient books say, is still a huge creature floating in the sea like a solitary island. [Chun] stands on the cliff, overlooking the boundless sky and sea from afar. The strong wind blows, sea birds circle around, making it appear extremely leisurely.
1:23:1|1:23:14|The sunset glow clustered on the dome, like fireworks, reflecting on [Chun] standing at the foot of the cliff, particularly charming. [Kun] leaped out of the sea and played, singing melodiously, stirring up countless waves and creating ripples.
1:23:14|1:23:25|The setting sun washes over the water, with stars twinkling and shining brightly. Watching [Kun] enjoying himself immensely, [Chun] cups his hands around his mouth and calls out,
1:23:27|1:23:56|[Kun] came over upon hearing the sound, leisurely swimming in the water while looking at the girl on the shore with teary eyes. [Chun] took a step forward, standing at the edge of the cliff, facing down towards [Kun], reaching out her arm, looking at his immensely huge body. Various past memories began to float before her eyes, [Chun] will not forget the joy when she first brought [Kun] back from Rousheng Tower, will not forget the happiness of dancing with [Kun] under the eaves in the rain, will not forget sitting on [Kun]'s back.
1:23:56|1:24:4|Through wind and rain, their souls intertwine in this life, their memories surge at this moment, making it hard to part.
1:24:4|1:24:47|Upon coming to her senses, [Chun] was already in tears, her hands held against her cheeks as she gently wiped away the tears. The sea breeze blew, carrying the teardrops from the corners of her eyes into the air, sparkling like translucent pearls. [Kun] leaped up from time to time, lightly brushing against [Chun]'s fingertips with his now gigantic body, perhaps wanting to feel her touch once more. [Qiu] stood silently as before, clutching the walnut in his hand, pondering the whispers of [Ling Po] by his side. After a moment, as if making a firm decision, he concentrated his divine power in his hands.
1:24:47|1:25:4|The shiny walnut suddenly shimmered, forming a yin-yang pattern, spinning in the air between [Qiu]'s palms. In an instant, a disturbance was felt in all directions, with the winds from Tianchi converging around [Qiu]'s left and right, causing clothes to flutter and autumn leaves to dance wildly.
1:25:4|1:25:19|Then the sea surged and roared, with a water dragon lurking along the coast, its body stretching thousands of feet with sea water, its whiskers made of waves and horns phosphorescent, its body resembling torn silk, eyes like the abyss, soaring straight towards the sky, opening the gate of the sea and sky once again.
1:25:19|1:25:52|[Kun], sensing something, swam quietly to beneath the Heavenly Gate. Its two fins transformed into wings, resembling the clouds in the sky, majestic and vast. It soared through the air, breaking through the waves, flying to the edge of the cliff. With a keen gaze, it looked at [Chun] in front of it. The day of parting had finally arrived. Although [Kun] had remained still, capable of accumulating water to three thousand feet and soaring ninety thousand miles, deep down it still harbored concerns and reluctance to leave. Looking at the girl on the cliff with a face full of sorrow, [Kun] with its huge eyes
1:25:52|1:26:0|Tears streaming down, [Chun] leaned against [Kun], stretching out her arms as if trying to embrace him once more.
1:26:0|1:26:29|After a long time, [Kun] finally turned around, flapped his huge wings, and flew towards the Gate of the Sea and Sky. As he entered the water column and approached the sky, [Chun] stood at the foot of the cliff, staring blankly, still unwilling to leave. Seeing [Chun] like this, [Qiu] couldn't bear to watch anymore. He clenched the walnut in his hand, determined in his heart, made a fist with both hands, split the walnut in half, only to find that there was no walnut kernel inside, but a smooth and shiny one.
1:26:29|1:26:43|Before her eyes, [Qiu] transformed his fist into a palm and swallowed that smooth object into his stomach. In an instant, [Qiu]'s body burned like fire, gradually turning into withered leaves drifting away. Enduring the pain of his internal organs burning, [Qiu] spoke,
1:27:4|1:27:13|Go to [Kun], aren't we going home together? I have redeemed your life from [Ling Po], and I will send you to live in the human world. [Chun] struggled to break free, but heard [Qiu] continue to say,
1:27:22|1:27:54|[Qiu] tears filled his eyes, finally spoke, and then he took [Chun] to the edge of the cliff. Holding her hands tightly, the cliff towered high, and the two fell into the air. [Qiu] took this opportunity to confess his love gently.
1:27:57|1:28:3|[Chun] heard what [Qiu] said, tears streaming down her face, and then heard [Qiu] softly say.
1:28:6|1:28:36|With that said, [Qiu] transformed into dry leaves, scattered by the wind and disappeared without a trace, leaving only [Chun] feeling sorrowful in secret. Moments later, where [Qiu] vanished, a few smooth and winding strands of light emerged, enveloping [Chun] within. The surging divine power forcibly transformed [Chun] into the appearance of a begonia flower, dragging the radiance towards the gate of the sea and sky. Flying around the water column, the divine power carrying the begonia flower rushed into the water column, instantly emitting dazzling light, blinding the eyes.
1:28:36|1:29:0|When the divine power dissipates, [Chun] unexpectedly transforms into a dolphin swimming in the water column. Neither belonging to the human world nor carrying any token, it can still transform into a dolphin to travel between the two realms. Only then did [Qiu] realize that it was the result of the confrontation with fate. The sunlight shines into the water column, guiding the way to the human world.
1:29:0|1:29:17|[Chun]'s eyes couldn't hide the longing, as if being drawn by that light, slowly floating upwards. When the water dragon returned to its nest and the gate of the sea and sky closed, the dark clouds above the Southern Ming Heavenly Pool dispersed, the water became calm like a mirror, reflecting the sea and sky, finally returning to its original state.
1:29:17|1:29:25|When everything returned to calm, [Chun] finally arrived in the human world as she had wished, and the scene gradually faded away.
1:30:7|1:30:32|In the deep waters of the human world, [Kun] transformed into the appearance of a boy and floated out to sea. He was gently pushed onto the shore by the waves. When he woke up, he struggled to get up from the water, as if his mouth and nose were choked by the seawater. After coughing and getting up, a small fish dropped from his mouth, wagging its tail, and left the sea before the boy noticed.
1:30:32|1:30:47|In the vast sea, with endless waters, not far away, the naked [Chun] walks towards the boy. As the girl gets closer and closer to the boy, his eyes are filled with confusion, but the girl smiles and approaches, paying no attention to the boy's bewilderment.
1:30:47|1:31:8|As the two approached, she reached out her arm towards the boy, the smile on her lips particularly charming. And at some point, the stone that had turned into [Qiu] inside the Chao Yuan Tower was tied around [Chun]'s neck. The sea breeze brushed over the stone, and a glimmer of sunset shone on [Qiu]'s temple.
1:31:16|1:31:24|The film is coming to an end here, thank you for listening. Stay tuned for a post-credits scene.
1:33:45|1:33:54|Now let's talk about the post-credits scene. As the camera pans up, the three-legged ferryman arrives by boat,
1:33:54|1:34:11|[Chun] handed a wrapped garment to [Ling Po], who held the bulging bag in both hands. Walking to the side of an ancient well, [Ling Po] opened the garment to reveal a variety of dried leaves piled on it, with [Qiu]'s jacket wrapped around them.
1:34:11|1:34:18|Shaking off the dry leaves onto the well cover, [Ling Po] then took out a sachet from her sleeve and spoke,
