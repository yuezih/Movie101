0:1:18|0:1:26|In the misty sky, the entire city was shrouded in darkness, with sporadic honking heard on the morning roads.
0:1:26|0:1:36|A woman in a military coat enters our view, pulling a dilapidated wooden cart. Loose screws indicate the worn-out condition of the cart, which is loaded with a stack of rough quality old cardboard.
0:1:37|0:1:42|Scattered mess piled on one side of the cart, with an abandoned plastic bottle pressed on top.
0:1:42|0:1:49|The woman used both hands to pull the cart, moving slowly forward, step by step, leaving deep snow pits on the ground.
0:1:49|0:1:57|The workers in the film, wrapped in thick scarves, walked along the road, diligently sweeping the ground with their heads down, causing dust to fly in the air.
0:1:57|0:2:3|The woman pushing the cart took a look, then continued on her way with a limp and a punch.
0:2:3|0:2:9|Approaching deep winter, the cold air tightly envelops this land, bringing a heavy snowfall to the city.
0:2:9|0:2:15|The woman's every step is on the snow, exhaling mist condensed by the cold.
0:2:15|0:2:24|The woman stopped in front of an old garbage bin, parked her car to the side, and half of her body leaned into the bin, trying to rummage through it to see if she could find anything valuable to sell.
0:2:28|0:2:32|At this moment, the cry of a baby caught the attention of the woman.
0:2:32|0:2:40|She looked around with a paper box in her hand, searching for the source of the sound.
0:2:40|0:2:48|The baby's crying grew closer and closer. The woman limped over to the side and found a tattered bamboo basket with a piece of cloth inside.
0:2:48|0:2:52|In front of the icy snow, the woman uncovered the cloth, revealing a baby on top.
0:3:19|0:3:25|Red Yan flew to the south, the sun was born from the horizon, the vast sky silently watched everything on the earth.
0:3:25|0:3:32|In the swirling snowflakes, the woman tremulously picked up the child in front of her, with a loving smile on her face.
0:3:32|0:3:41|The child, so young yet possessing such strong vitality, disregarded the wooden cart beside her and walked a few steps in the snow, cradling the child in her arms.
0:3:42|0:3:46|She looked around for a long time as if searching for the person who had lost this child.
0:3:46|0:3:52|The weather was so cold that every breath the woman exhaled turned into a mist in the air.
0:3:52|0:3:58|The child in his arms, however, was very sensible and did not struggle, perhaps due to the influence of the weather.
0:3:58|0:4:1|As far as the eye can see, there is only boundless snow and silent shadows of buildings.
0:4:1|0:4:6|Seeing that there was no one around, [Han Shaofen] decided to take the child home and take care of him herself.
0:4:6|0:4:23|In the run-down shack, [Han Shaofen] worked diligently while taking care of the child. She wrapped the child in a thick floral blanket, tied it to her back with a rope, wrung out the washed diapers with her hands, shook off the excess water, and then hung them in the yard in an orderly manner.
0:4:23|0:4:27|The child, always silently accompanying her on her back.
0:4:53|0:5:2|Even in the deserted late night, [Han Shaofen] tirelessly carries her child on her back, dragging a cart, searching through the garbage cans for usable items.
0:5:8|0:5:14|Outside, she used her own hands to slowly move as much scrap as possible, hoping to get a good price in exchange.
0:5:14|0:5:18|At home, [Han Shaofen] tirelessly took on all the responsibilities of raising the children.
0:5:18|0:5:22|Even though her legs are not convenient, she is still a person who works hard.
0:5:22|0:5:29|He lifted the child's blanket, held the child in his arms, and the child's little face twitched, looking very displeased.
0:5:29|0:5:33|He patted the child's head with his other hand, trying to calm the child down.
0:5:33|0:5:38|After a moment, he picked up the woolen hat on the bed and put it on the child's head.
0:5:38|0:5:46|The child gradually stopped crying. He lifted the child a little higher, picked up the bottle on the right side of the table, tested the temperature, and slowly fed the child.
0:5:46|0:5:55|Days passed by like this, with [Han Shaofen] not only taking care of the young children, but also bearing the weight of two people's lives with the age of several times.
0:5:55|0:5:59|During the day, [Han Shaofen] needs to meet the West Lake man who collects garbage regularly.
0:5:59|0:6:4|He dragged the heavy and massive scrap cardboard step by step into the landfill.
0:6:4|0:6:13|He stared intently at the propped-up balance, while the man with a humble attitude negotiated the price. [Han Shaofen] dragged her entwined legs, wandering through every corner of the recycling station.
0:6:13|0:6:22|The man seemed to understand her difficulties and patiently talked to her until she sold all the thick cardboard on the car and pulled her wooden cart back.
0:6:22|0:6:26|In this way, in the struggle of [Han Shaofen], the days passed by one by one.
0:6:26|0:6:31|On this day, a young beauty came to her home and played with the child in her arms.
0:6:48|0:6:54|The child with a knitted hat is held in the arms of the aunt with a disfigured face, looking at the grandmother with small eyes.
0:6:54|0:6:58|Grandma looked at the child's bright smile, and she smiled along.
0:6:58|0:7:2|She nodded slightly and gave a satisfied smile to the aunt with a disfigured face.
0:7:23|0:7:26|Grandma walked into the office unsteadily.
0:7:48|0:7:51|Grandma lowered her head for a moment, avoiding the gaze of the person in front of her.
0:7:54|0:7:58|Grandma lowered her head again, looking at the ground, and let out a long sigh.
0:8:35|0:8:46|The grandmother helplessly lowered her head and walked out with a cane, looking back frequently as if wanting to say something, but remained silent when she saw the staff arguing over the procedures.
0:8:46|0:8:56|Grandma once again leaned on her cane and entered an office that seemed to belong to a person in charge. She even refused to sit down, earnestly hoping that the person in front of her could help her.
0:8:56|0:9:4|Two people stood in front of the window, too far apart to hear their voices, only able to see the sunlight shining on their faces, the anxiety on [Grandma]'s face was evident.
0:9:5|0:9:9|It seems that even the person across from them has been touched, and the two of them seem to have reached some kind of consensus.
0:9:9|0:9:15|Grandma settled in a palace, only leaving the police station afterwards. She then continued to explain to the government officials.
0:12:9|0:12:12|Better understanding his feelings towards the children.
0:12:16|0:12:20|However, [Han Shaofen] is indeed facing difficulties.
0:12:41|0:12:48|The responsible woman took the water from the director's hand with a heavy heart, feeling uneasy, she put down the cup and spoke again.
0:13:34|0:13:36|The child arrived at the Children's Village.
0:13:42|0:13:45|Listen, [Ma Dongmei] hesitated and nodded.
0:13:45|0:13:48|That day, Grandma [Han Xue] and the little girl got up early in the morning.
0:13:48|0:13:55|The girl, carrying a brand new backpack, bounces around the room, occasionally flashing a smile at her grandmother, very happy.
0:13:55|0:14:0|However, [Grandma] was the only one standing by the window, staring tightly at the door outside.
0:14:0|0:14:5|The sunlight outlines the contours on [Grandma]'s face, as well as the unease and anxiety on her face.
0:14:5|0:14:9|The little girl is still bouncing around in the room, exuding an air of joy.
0:14:10|0:14:17|But he found that [Grandma] was still standing by the window, unwilling to move, so he ran up and grabbed her arm.
0:14:36|0:14:37|[Grandmother] and the girl hurriedly left the house.
0:15:10|0:15:19|Aunt Liu couldn't even look directly into Grandma's eyes at this moment. She held Grandma's arm and walked quickly to the side, taking three steps and sitting down two steps.
0:15:19|0:15:28|After helping Grandma sit down, [Liu Aiyi]'s lips trembled slightly. Despite Grandma's expectant gaze, she still didn't speak, then looked to the side.
0:16:51|0:16:55|The child is feeling very sad.
0:17:4|0:17:8|Facing the crucial question from the little girl, the uncle remained silent without saying a word.
0:17:8|0:17:11|He reached out his hand and gently touched the girl's head.
0:18:52|0:18:58|The problem now is, school has already started, how can we not delay [Han Xue] from going to school?
0:21:4|0:21:6|[Han Xue] and her grandmother held each other tightly, unable to hold back their emotions.
0:21:28|0:21:33|Seeing the deep bond between the grandmother and the girl, even the two staff members couldn't help but be moved.
0:21:33|0:21:39|So, the staff Auntie Liu returned to the leader's office and submitted the proposal for discussion.
0:21:39|0:21:44|The leader was seen carefully reading the document in front of him, making annotations with a pen.
0:21:52|0:21:56|Aunt Liu walked out of the office and then walked into the police station with the documents.
0:21:56|0:22:7|The police officer looked at the information provided by Aunt Liu, operated on the computer, and handed over a small book with the residents' household registration records written on it.
0:22:7|0:22:14|Looking at the thin booklet in her hand, [Liu Auntie] couldn't help but tighten her grip a little, a contented smile appearing on her face.
0:22:14|0:22:20|She returned to her grandmother's house, sat face to face with her grandmother, and handed the resident household registration book to her.
0:22:42|0:22:53|Upon hearing these words, [Han Grandma] felt a huge weight lifted off her heart. A look of confusion briefly flashed across her face, then she lowered her head slightly and revealed a relieved smile.
0:22:53|0:22:58|Red Yan flew south again, and autumn came once more. Another year passed in the blink of an eye.
0:22:58|0:23:4|That day, [Grandma Han] came to the supermarket, carefully choosing something, her eyes hesitantly wavering.
0:23:4|0:23:18|It seems hesitant about the price, and then the scene shifts to an elementary school, where [Grandma Han] and a large group of parents are standing at the door waiting for the children to finish school.
0:23:18|0:23:27|The security guard slowly pushed open the gate. Amid the bustling crowd of parents, in the eager and hopeful gazes of everyone, the children ran out with the vigor of youth.
0:24:14|0:24:22|[Han Xue] smiled, supporting her grandmother's arm with her hand, while her grandmother stubbornly held onto a cane, walking side by side with [Han Xue] towards home.
0:24:22|0:24:28|Back home, Grandma prepared a sumptuous dinner for [Han Xue], then took something out of the room.
0:24:34|0:24:39|Grandma opened the cloth bag and took out neatly stacked scarves from inside.
0:24:41|0:24:47|[Han Xue], who was eating ribs, was about to reach out but was stopped by her grandmother.
0:24:47|0:24:54|Saying that, Grandma took [Han Xue]'s hand, wiped off the oil on her own sleeve, and draped the handkerchief in her hand over [Han Xue].
0:24:54|0:24:56|Just then, the sound of the door opening could be heard.
0:25:25|0:25:32|Grandma took the clothes handed to her by Aunt Liu, her lips trembling slightly, as if unsure how to express her gratitude.
0:25:38|0:25:41|Grandma gently patted Aunt Liu's hand and nodded.
0:25:41|0:25:44|On this day, [Han Xue] is attending a music class at school.
0:26:27|0:26:34|In the evening at home, [Han Xue] sings and dances in the room, while [Grandma Han] smiles and claps along beside her.
0:26:34|0:26:43|In the dim room, only a desk lamp emits a warm light, which seems like a perfectly placed stage light, illuminating the movements of [Han Xue] as she dances.
0:26:44|0:26:49|[Han Granny] sits on the bed, her cane placed to the side, rhythmically tapping along to the beat for [Han Xue].
0:26:49|0:26:54|And [Han Xue] faced [Han Grandma], wanting to show the full picture of this song to [Han Grandma].
0:26:54|0:26:59|At the end of the performance, [Grandma Han] clapped her hands and couldn't stop laughing when she saw [Han Xue]'s wonderful performance.
0:26:59|0:27:3|Unexpectedly, [Han Xue] suddenly stood still in the room at this moment.
0:27:3|0:27:10|In the puzzled gaze of [Grandma Han], [Han Xue] was staring straight ahead, her eyes unfocused and filled with tears.
0:27:13|0:27:19|Upon hearing the inquiry from [Grandma Han], [Han Xue]'s emotions became even more painful, a tear slid from the corner of her eye, and [Grandma Han] quickly got up.
0:28:17|0:28:31|Saying that, [Grandma Han] pulled [Han Xue] into her arms and hugged her tightly.
0:28:31|0:28:37|Early the next morning, [Han Xue] went to school, and [Grandma Han] started rummaging through the cabinets at home looking for something.
0:28:37|0:28:40|She took out a huge bamboo box and fumbled underneath the clothes.
0:28:40|0:28:57|Grandma dug out a dirty cloth bundle from under the box, placed it heavily on the bed, then sat down and untied the knot on the top sideways. As she sorted through layers of old clothes stained with the marks of time, she searched for something, feeling around for a long time before pulling out a small silk satin bundle from the interlayer.
0:28:57|0:29:8|She carefully picked up the shiny little bag, and after opening it layer by layer, she found a pair of jade bracelets inside, in quite good condition. The jade bracelets in her old hands reflected a warm light.
0:29:9|0:29:29|Reflected in the hesitant and silent eyes of [Han Xue], ultimately no words slipped out from the grandmother. The jade bracelet could transcend the intense drama seen by anyone, but many years had passed, her face no longer bore the resemblance of a young girl. She recalled that distant afternoon when she sat in the dilapidated room, her mother carefully holding this satin pouch.
0:29:45|0:29:52|During the conversation, the old man carefully put the bracelet on [Han Shaofen]'s wrist.
0:29:52|0:30:3|[Han Shaofen] holds the bracelet and her mother's hand together, behind them is an elderly person in the twilight of life, filled with earnest expectations.
0:30:3|0:30:13|Looking at the pair of extraordinary bracelets in her hand, [Han Grandma] had a moment of confusion, but after some thought, she still took the bracelets and left the house.
0:30:14|0:30:16|Pedestrians come and go, while the traffic flows steadily.
0:30:16|0:30:19|Nanny Han arrived at the pawnshop's door, leaning on a cane.
0:30:19|0:30:24|The passersby hurried along, no one had time to stop and linger.
0:30:24|0:30:28|Under the four large characters of Shunhe Pawnshop, the individual appeared so small and helpless.
0:30:28|0:30:37|The character appears to be elderly, with the glass covered in densely packed service principles, like a deep abyss, devouring those troubled by stomach issues.
0:30:37|0:30:46|[Han Xue] stood at the door, leaning the crutch to one side, slowly took out a silk cloth pouch from her bosom, and carefully took out the bracelet from it.
0:30:46|0:30:51|Her hands were still wearing gloves, indicating the importance of the bracelet.
0:30:51|0:30:57|As [Han Xue] was about to walk towards the pawnshop, she hesitated and reluctance was clearly visible on her face.
0:30:57|0:31:7|At this moment, he has arrived here with no other choice, leaving only a dusty figure behind. His waist appears so alluring at this moment.
0:31:7|0:31:18|[Ma Dongmei] took slow and steady steps forward, using a cane to support himself on each step up the stairs before moving his leg up, and he walked into the pawnshop like this.
0:31:18|0:31:20|The next day, [Han Xue] returned home.
0:31:56|0:32:4|[Han Xue] continued to return to the center of the house, dancing gracefully to the music playing on the recorder, every step exuding joy.
0:32:37|0:32:42|Grandma looked at [Han Xue] with a loving gaze, her eyes full of care and affection.
0:32:42|0:32:47|Her lips curled slightly upwards, because of [Han Xue]'s performance, making her feel that everything was worth it.
0:32:47|0:32:52|After finishing the dance, little [Han Xue] walked slowly to the recorder, bent down, and rested her head on it.
0:33:21|0:33:31|That day in school, during a composition class that students were eagerly anticipating, the female teacher picked up the chalk on the platform and started writing on the blackboard stroke by stroke.
0:33:31|0:33:38|The sound of chalk colliding with the blackboard is clearly audible, accompanied by the female teacher's writing, leaving chalk dust on the blackboard.
0:33:38|0:33:45|Several seconds passed, as the children whispered to each other, the teacher finished writing six big characters. She turned around, looked at the children below the stage, and said.
0:34:3|0:34:8|The teacher threw the chalk back into the chalk box, stepped down from the platform, and urged the children to write their essays one by one.
0:34:10|0:34:16|The teacher walked around the classroom to supervise everyone, making sure that each person was writing properly.
0:34:16|0:34:19|The children all lowered their heads and racked their brains to write essays.
0:34:19|0:34:23|Some children are deeply absorbed in writing, not lifting their heads for half an hour.
0:34:23|0:34:27|Some children were chatting around, while others were writing for a while and playing for a while.
0:34:27|0:34:33|While [Han Xue] was lost in confusion at this moment, she leaned over her homework book with a bewildered look in her eyes.
0:34:33|0:34:39|While [Han Xue] was at a loss, the little boy beside her put down the pen in his hand and raised his hand upright.
0:34:46|0:34:53|At this moment, [Han Xue] was still holding a pen and working on the questions. There were only questions on the notebook in front of her, with no other traces.
0:34:53|0:34:55|The teacher noticed this anomaly.
0:35:29|0:35:35|[Han Xue] listened to the teacher's words, sat down slowly, clenched the pen in her hand, and a hint of melancholy in her eyes.
0:35:35|0:35:40|After class, [Han Xue] walked with the little boy she had just fought with earlier.
0:36:23|0:36:27|The little boy ran off happily.
0:36:27|0:36:36|The little boy lifted his leg and sat on the back seat of his mother's bicycle, then turned around and waved goodbye to the girl.
0:36:36|0:36:39|In [Han Xue]'s eyes, the boy and his mother were gradually drifting apart.
0:36:52|0:36:58|[Han Xue] gazed affectionately at the boy and his mother chatting and laughing, with a hint of longing in her eyes.
0:36:58|0:37:3|Watching, she seemed to be lost in a fantasy, as if she herself was sitting in the back seat of her mother's car.
0:37:34|0:37:47|In [Han Xue]'s imagination, her mother should be a woman with a delicate face and friendly demeanor. Not only does she pick her up from school every day, but she also takes her out to play. Her mother would hold her in her arms, and put on a hat woven with flowers for her.
0:37:51|0:37:54|The image of the mother is so vivid.
0:37:54|0:37:58|Thinking of this, [Han Xue] in real life couldn't help but smile.
0:38:11|0:38:13|The woman suddenly pressed the brake.
0:38:48|0:39:7|The woman suddenly recalled the distant project of snow sweeping. She stood with several coworkers, watching a woman with a limp, pushing a cart with one hand and carrying a child with the other.
0:39:7|0:39:12|The limping woman tightly holds her child in her arms under the gaze of the crowd.
0:39:15|0:39:22|The woman riding a bicycle finished reminiscing about [Han Xue]'s past with the child, patted the child's shoulder, and rode on towards home.
0:40:5|0:40:9|After listening to the words of [Han Shaofen]'s grandmother, Liu Ayun twisted her lower lip and nodded.
0:40:9|0:40:12|In the campus of the old days, children were playing in small groups, disturbing each other.
0:41:10|0:41:16|The boy moved his lips and told [Xiao Xue] everything he heard from his mother yesterday.
0:41:16|0:41:26|[Xiao Xue] stood still on the spot. At this moment, [Han Granny], who had just finished a busy day, stood in the dilapidated courtyard, looking up at the sky. The sky was very dark, like an unbroken swamp.
0:41:26|0:41:39|With a sense of an impending storm, she stood quietly at the door with a baton in her right hand, her eyes filled with indescribable emotions, her gaze unfocused as if pondering something.
0:41:39|0:41:45|She was dressed as if ready to go out, not knowing if the next moment she would leave here.
0:41:45|0:41:55|At the same time, in the school, [Xiao Xue] is sitting alone in a spacious classroom, with no one around, the room is empty, with only her figure.
0:41:56|0:42:7|The voices of the children in the distance came sporadically, blocked by the transparent window, appearing sparse and sparse, as if it was not the sound that was divided by the window, but two different worlds.
0:42:7|0:42:18|[Xiao Xue] sat in her own seat, leaning slightly forward as if slumped on the table, with her hair hanging down from the side of her face, a few strands partially covering her face, creating a scattered play of light and shadow.
0:42:19|0:42:30|Her tender right hand held a colored pen, doodling on a piece of white paper on the table. She had already drawn herself with greenish handwriting, standing alone on the side.
0:42:30|0:42:36|At this moment, as if feeling something in her heart, she shook her wrist and began to draw next to the figurine.
0:42:36|0:42:45|In her drawing, a long-haired figure gradually emerges, slightly taller than her. It is clear that the long-haired figure represents her mother.
0:43:7|0:43:14|By nightfall, the sky had darkened, like a night that would never see light, pressing down in large swathes.
0:43:14|0:43:18|[Han Xue] then, as usual, leaned on her crutch and made her way down the street with a punch and a limp.
0:43:18|0:43:24|On the other side, [Han Shaofen] had already left the school gate alone with a backpack, while [Han Xue] was still walking on the road.
0:43:58|0:44:7|After saying goodbye to Aunt Liu, [Han Xue] looked at the letter in her hand, then carefully put it in her bag and continued walking forward.
0:44:7|0:44:15|She walked slowly to the school gate, which was usually bustling with people but now closed and empty.
0:44:15|0:44:21|This made [Han Xue] curiously approach the door, and after a moment, she knocked on the door again, hoping to see if anyone was inside.
0:44:37|0:44:43|After listening to the security guard's words, [Han Xue]'s psychological doubts deepened, like dark vines entwining her heart.
0:44:43|0:44:47|Her expression froze, the wrinkles on her face deepening a few more lines.
0:44:47|0:44:52|After a while, she finally came to her senses, belatedly thanked the security guard, and turned to walk away.
0:44:53|0:44:55|Even forgot their own umbrella in the original place.
0:44:55|0:45:2|Night fell, and with the darkness came a heavy snowfall that had been brewing for half of the winter.
0:45:2|0:45:9|The snowflakes no longer danced lightly, but resembled a huge net, falling densely.
0:45:9|0:45:15|Xiaoxue buried herself deeply in her padded jacket, hunching her neck, walking in the swirling snow.
0:45:15|0:45:20|Her figure was obscured by the dense snowflakes, and her appearance was barely visible in the snow.
0:45:21|0:45:30|At the same time, the anxious [Grandma Han] was walking on the street with an uneasy look, looking around for any sign of Little Xue. Her cane even slipped on the road.
0:45:30|0:45:41|In the howling cold wind, she tried her best to loudly ask every passerby about the whereabouts of Xiao Xue, even though her voice was muffled in the wind and snow, and every bit of hope scattered like a faint light.
0:45:42|0:45:48|And she just tightened her scarf, shook off the snow on her shoulders, and continued to walk steadfastly.
0:45:48|0:45:52|The sound of the crutch tapping lightly echoed rhythmically along the long street.
0:45:52|0:45:57|The crisp and rhythmic sound plays the anxious inner voice of a woman.
0:45:57|0:46:0|Pedestrians hurried by as cars raced past on the street.
0:46:0|0:46:7|In the vast city, the figure of [Han Xue]'s grandmother is so small that it seems no one cares about this corner.
0:46:7|0:46:10|And at this moment, [Han Shaofen] had already struggled to walk to a large tree.
0:46:28|0:46:36|Aunt Liu was also searching in the woods by the road with a flashlight at this time, and finally found the crying [Han Shaofen] under a tree.
0:46:36|0:46:39|So, the aunt took [Han Shaofen] home to warm up.
0:46:54|0:46:59|At the same time, [Grandma] also slowly walked into the forest step by step.
0:46:59|0:47:9|Looking around in the gaps between towering trees, searching for the trace of [Han Shaofen], she waits patiently in the cold wind and snow, examining every trace of [Han Shaofen] in the woods.
0:47:43|0:47:50|At this moment, [Grandma] was still wandering outside, feeling melancholic. Her face was shrouded in shadows, dim and unclear.
0:47:50|0:47:59|Come on, Xue, [Han Shaofen] who was curled up in the blanket sat up, took the clothes handed by the aunt, and slowly draped them over her body.
0:48:2|0:48:8|Her life became even more difficult.
0:49:35|0:49:41|[Han Shaofen] sitting on the sofa slowly gets up, puts the blanket aside, and starts putting on her shoes.
0:49:41|0:49:44|Auntie [Liu] quickly stood up and supported Little Xue.
0:49:44|0:49:50|[Aunt Liu] held Little Snow's hand and walked step by step in the dark forest, with car lights flashing behind them.
0:49:50|0:49:53|Xiaoxue walked faster and faster, anxious to see her grandmother.
0:50:29|0:50:38|Grandma looked at Xiaoxue expectantly, stuffed the letter into Xiaoxue's arms, then extended her gloved right hand and looked at the letter in her hand together with Xiaoxue.
0:50:38|0:50:47|And [Aunt Liu] also saw this scene from a distance, as if she dared not approach or disturb, looking away, seemingly holding back tears from falling.
0:50:47|0:50:54|Early the next morning, [Xiao Xue] got up as usual and went to the kitchen alone, carrying a huge steamer, preparing breakfast.
0:50:55|0:51:12|He picked up the porcelain plate next to him, took out the freshly steamed bun and placed it on top. The bun was steaming hot, and he held the plate full of buns in one hand and a plate of freshly steamed meat in the other, swaying towards the table by the window. The morning sunlight outlined the figure of [Xiao Xue] who was sensible again.
0:51:13|0:51:34|Outlining the clear contours of the dishes, also scattered on the table, the [grandson] carefully arranged the main course and side dishes on the table that the grandmother brought back for him with a valuable record player. Then he turned around, smiling, and went to the kitchen to fetch water, then turned around and walked towards the grandmother who was still lying motionless in bed.
0:51:54|0:52:2|Xiao Xue hurriedly turned around and ran towards the window, picked up the nearby kettle, poured hot water into a porcelain bowl, and carried the bowl towards her grandmother.
0:52:4|0:52:10|He automatically held the bowl up to his grandmother's mouth, thinking that this way she could drink the hot water.
0:52:10|0:52:14|After trying for a long time, Grandma couldn't drink any water because she was unconscious.
0:52:14|0:52:19|So, [Han Xue] thought for a moment, then placed the bowl on the bedside and hurried to the kitchen.
0:52:19|0:52:26|She hesitated in the kitchen for a moment, then took out a small spoon and quickly ran back to the room with it.
0:52:26|0:52:28|She tiptoed to her grandmother's bedside.
0:52:29|0:52:45|Bend down, holding a bowl in one hand and a spoon in the other, slowly bringing the water to Grandma's lips.
0:52:47|0:52:52|[Han Xue] was suddenly panicked, placed the bowl on the table, and then turned to open the door and ran out.
0:52:53|0:52:58|The heavy snow outside continued to fall, accumulating a thick layer on the ground.
0:52:58|0:53:4|[Han Xue] braves the cold wind, running in the heavy snow, not caring even if she falls down.
0:53:15|0:53:17|But she continued to run aimlessly.
0:53:25|0:53:32|[Han Xue] is running desperately on the slippery stone road, tears on her face seem to be freezing, but she doesn't care.
0:53:54|0:53:58|Aunt Liu quickly put on her clothes and went out with [Han Xue] after hearing the words.
0:53:58|0:54:11|The two returned to [Han Xue]'s home, in a hurry, they took out the small cart that Han's grandmother used daily. They had Han's grandmother lie on her back on the cart, then one of them pulled the handle of the cart and rushed towards the hospital for several seconds.
0:54:11|0:54:17|Grandma remained unconscious even as the car bumped along, her brows slightly furrowed, showing no signs of waking up.
0:54:17|0:54:22|Upon arriving at the hospital, [Grandma] was quickly taken into the operating room and lay weakly on the hospital bed.
0:54:22|0:54:26|Aunt Liu and [Han Xue] walked towards the door, anxiously pacing back and forth.
0:54:26|0:54:28|In anxiety, the doctor walked out.
0:55:39|0:55:45|[Han Xue] nodded, glanced at the notice, and suddenly ran to the front of the window at the entrance of Jiangfei City.
0:56:35|0:56:37|Immediate surgery is needed.
0:56:47|0:56:50|Without stopping, the people accompanying the dean walked away in [Han Xue]'s gaze towards the distance.
0:57:14|0:57:19|During that week, [Han Xue] as Jiang Lü'er actually knelt down and crawled step by step towards Dean An.
0:58:49|0:58:55|The dean stood up straight, feeling his pockets while pushing the little girl towards the garden group.
0:58:55|0:58:58|The people around are wiping tears with their hands.
0:58:58|0:59:3|At this moment, the auntie from the consumption room also stood among the garden group, waiting for the director's decision.
0:59:26|0:59:31|In just a few seconds, [Han Shaofen] Auntie collected a large sum of money in her hands.
0:59:31|0:59:34|Finally, [Grandma] can have the surgery done right away.
0:59:43|0:59:56|After experiencing her grandmother's serious illness, [Han Xue] sat alone in the classroom, staring blankly at her previous words. The mother she had drawn with her own hands now appeared so glaring and painful in her eyes.
0:59:56|1:0:3|[Han Xue] slowly reached out her hand and tore the painting, which had once been filled with her countless love and effort, from the notebook and held it in her hand.
1:0:3|1:0:8|The torn edges of the paper seem to be indicating the bumpy road of [Han Xue]'s life.
1:0:8|1:0:14|She carefully examined the painting under the sunlight, tears already sliding down her cheeks.
1:0:14|1:0:19|[Han Xue] suddenly stood up, the piece of paper in her hand feeling so hot and irritating at this moment.
1:0:19|1:0:25|His face first showed sadness, then gradually evolved into a complex mix of anger.
1:0:25|1:0:29|He reached out and forcefully tore the paper in half, but it wasn't enough.
1:0:29|1:0:34|His hands moved faster and faster, as if venting his anger, tearing the painting in his hands into pieces.
1:0:34|1:0:38|Finally, the thin piece of paper in his hand was torn into a pile of fragments.
1:0:38|1:0:42|He walked to the window, pushed it open, and threw the debris in his hand outside.
1:0:42|1:0:45|Flurries flutter down like snow.
1:0:45|1:0:50|Later, [Han Xue] walked onto the playground and encountered the boy who had previously mocked her among the playing children.
1:1:6|1:1:13|[Han Xue] looked at the two boys in front of her bowing their heads in apology, couldn't help but show a faint smile, and then nodded.
1:1:13|1:1:19|Finally, the day arrived when [Han Xue] and these two boys went to the hospital entrance to pick up Grandma who was being discharged.
1:1:19|1:1:27|Grandma, who has just recovered from a serious illness, is still unsteady on her feet. Three children each hold one side of Grandma and slowly lead her towards the small swing car.
1:1:31|1:1:41|With the joint efforts of the three children, they managed to get Grandma onto the cart. They pulled the cart together while cheering each other on, heading towards home with [Han Xue].
1:1:44|1:1:51|In a cheerful atmosphere, the children walked away with [Han Xue], and their lives finally returned to normal.
1:1:51|1:1:56|From then on, every day on the way to school, [Han Xue] carried her own school bag and followed her grandmother pulling a cart.
1:1:56|1:2:1|[Han Xue] also held onto the armrest, hoping to relieve the pressure on her grandmother.
1:2:1|1:2:6|Sometimes when she comes across abandoned plastic bottles on the road, [Han Xue] picks them up first and puts them behind the cart.
1:2:8|1:2:17|In this way, [Han Xue] always accompanies her grandmother, sharing the burdens and hardships of her grandmother's life. She always smiles and runs around her grandmother.
1:2:17|1:2:23|With the help of [Han Xue], grandma's burden was significantly reduced, and her leg discomfort and physical weakness seemed less important.
1:2:24|1:2:28|Therefore, no matter how tough and difficult the days are, there is hope.
1:2:28|1:2:36|[Han Xue] will take her grandmother to the vacant lot piled with scrap, bid farewell to her grandmother, and then reluctantly carry her school bag to school.
1:2:36|1:2:41|In the evening, [Grandma] who had worked hard all day pushed open the gate and pulled the old cart back to the small courtyard.
1:2:41|1:2:48|The cart was heavy, with dozens of centimeters thick cardboard scattered loosely in the frame, tied with thin plastic ropes.
1:2:48|1:2:52|The gap next to it is still filled with many bottles and cans, looking very crowded.
1:2:52|1:3:5|[Han Xue] struggled to pull the car into the yard, took a deep breath, and then pushed the car from the middle of the yard to the corner of the shed.
1:3:5|1:3:7|For the grandmother who has just recovered from a serious illness,
1:3:7|1:3:10|The work that could be handled in the past has now become difficult at this moment.
1:3:11|1:3:18|She was already physically disabled and elderly, but unwilling to reduce her workload at this moment because she still needed to support this family.
1:3:18|1:3:22|After she put the cart down, her legs were already a little weak.
1:3:22|1:3:34|Continuing, as she adjusted her posture, the cane in her hand accidentally got tangled in the rope of the cart, and the cane happened to get stuck under her foot, causing the grandmother to lose her balance for a moment.
1:3:34|1:3:39|Fortunately, at this moment, [Han Shaofen] returned home from school and saw her grandmother falling down, so she hurried over.
1:3:47|1:3:50|Grandma looked into [Han Shaofen]'s eyes and nodded.
1:4:9|1:4:12|Grandma's eyes lit up with a hint of surprise, slightly leaning towards [Ma Dongmei].
1:4:12|1:4:15|After school, [Han Xue] and her classmates walked on the street.
1:4:42|1:4:50|In a quick cut, on a bustling street, a group of children gather together, each holding a small bunch of roses.
1:4:50|1:4:53|Pedestrians passing by actively greet each other, but few stop to linger.
1:5:3|1:5:18|At this moment, [Han Xue] caught up with a simple and honest man, who seemed to be saying something about selling. The man seemed to want to push the girl away strangely, but [Han Xue] kept chasing after him, handing the flowers to him. The man seemed to be finally persuaded and took one.
1:5:24|1:5:34|Facing the cheers and applause from the audience, the classmates, however, did not react much.
1:5:34|1:5:42|Thinking like this, the children gathered their courage once again, tidied up the flowers in their hands, wandered on the street, and tried to sell them to every passerby.
1:5:42|1:5:47|They intercepted the grandmother who was buying groceries halfway, and chased after the young couple carrying a bag next to her.
1:5:47|1:5:52|They just hope to sell a little more, but business is always disappointing.
1:6:22|1:6:32|The boy ran home to get his accordion, then went to the bustling street with [Han Xue], playing the accordion, singing, and selling flowers to passersby.
1:6:32|1:6:37|And this scene was also seen by two people on the overpass not far away.
1:6:52|1:6:59|Saying that, the man and woman on the rooftop smiled at each other, put away their devices, walked down the steps, and headed towards [Han Xue].
1:6:59|1:7:8|That night, [Han Shaofen] tidied up the room as usual, holding a wrinkled rag in her hand, cleaning up the things on the table under the dim light.
1:7:8|1:7:14|She brought the books on the table over, then wiped every corner with a cloth, tidying up until she reached [Han Xue]'s pencil case.
1:7:15|1:7:22|He casually opened the pencil case and unexpectedly found a large denomination bill underneath, pressed down by a pencil.
1:7:22|1:7:31|He held the crumpled banknote and looked at it under the dim desk lamp for a long time, a hint of anxiety and anger flashed across his face, and soon turned into an undisguised confusion.
1:7:31|1:7:34|So he came to the bedside of [Han Xue].
1:9:9|1:9:14|[Han Shaofen] reached out her hand and tightly embraced [Han Xue], carefully tucking the blanket around her.
1:9:14|1:9:20|The next day after school, the child, carrying his small backpack again, walked to a railing by the roadside.
1:9:20|1:9:24|[Han Xue] sat down slowly, furrowing her brows slightly, with a look of confusion on her face.
1:10:12|1:10:16|The air seemed to solidify, and upon hearing these words, [Han Xue] stood up abruptly.
1:10:59|1:11:2|Han Xue thought for a moment, then nodded slightly.
1:11:2|1:11:8|The next day, on the pedestrian bridge in the city center, [Han Xue] knelt on a cushion with grass stuck on her head, while her classmates stood behind her.
1:11:15|1:11:17|The little girl next to [Han Xue] seems to have made a gesture of gratitude towards her.
1:12:58|1:13:4|And at Aunt Liu's house, the aunt who was busy with housework suddenly heard a voice coming from the TV, "Hello, Madam."
1:13:44|1:13:52|The moment the woman finished speaking, [Grandma] froze on the spot, not even realizing that the glass bottle in her hand had slipped and fallen to the ground.
1:13:52|1:13:56|Seeing the familiar face after the woman took off her glasses, [Grandma] finally realized her mistake.
1:14:0|1:14:6|[Han Granny]'s expression on her face, from the previous confusion, gradually transforms into a kind of belated surprise.
1:14:6|1:14:10|She showed a sincere smile to [Han Xue]'s mother and quickly led her into the room.
1:14:10|1:14:21|[Han Xue]'s mother followed her grandmother's slow steps and entered this old dilapidated house, entering a residence where [Han Xue] had lived for nearly ten years since birth.
1:14:21|1:14:28|The room exudes a sense of antiquity and hardship, with the walls showing signs of decay and disrepair.
1:14:29|1:14:35|There are only two thousand rooms in total, and the only valuable thing might be the six pounds bought with a large sum of money, lying quietly on the table.
1:14:35|1:14:47|[Han Xue]'s mother looked around the room in confusion, the harsh environment leaving her feeling lost and unsure. Her gaze wandered aimlessly around the room.
1:14:47|1:14:48|[Grandma] limped.
1:14:52|1:15:3|[Han Xue]'s mother bent down, somewhat nervously, to take the water bowl handed to her by the grandmother. After placing it on the table in front of her, she sat down facing the grandmother.
1:15:3|1:15:8|The woman lowered her head to avoid Grandma's gaze.
1:15:15|1:15:25|Just then, Aunt Liu, who had been taking care of [Han Xue]'s family, pushed the door open and looked at [Han Xue]'s mother with a green-eyed gaze. Grandma quickly pulled her aside.
1:15:40|1:15:43|Aunt Liu grasped Grandma's arm and lowered her head in thought for a moment.
1:15:46|1:15:51|Aunt Liu pursed her lips, bypassed Grandma, and walked steadily towards [Han Xue]'s mother.
1:16:39|1:16:42|Both of them were stunned when they heard this.
1:16:42|1:16:44|After a moment, [Mrs. Liu] looked at him and spoke.
1:16:56|1:16:59|[Han Xue]'s mother holds her grandmother's hand, feeling extremely distressed.
1:18:0|1:18:21|[Han Xue]'s mother almost shed tears, her face filled with guilt as she looked down.
1:18:21|1:18:24|At this moment, the door of the room was pushed open again.
1:18:28|1:18:32|After hearing the journalist's accusations, [Han Xue]'s mother couldn't bear it anymore.
1:18:32|1:18:37|She pushed open the door without saying a word, and Liang Liang ran out from inside coughing.
1:19:14|1:19:18|Late at night, [Han Xue] murmurs to herself in her dream.
1:19:52|1:19:59|Grandma held [Han Xue] tightly, embracing her with aching heart, cupping her face in her hands and wiping away the tears on her face.
1:19:59|1:20:5|The next day, [Han Xue]'s mother sat in the office, holding a pen in her hand and writing something in a notebook.
1:20:45|1:20:47|The male journalist spoke earnestly.
1:20:47|1:20:50|The woman next to him turned to the man and gestured for him to follow.
1:21:18|1:21:21|Little [Han Xue]'s mother furrowed her brows and then turned around and left.
1:21:21|1:21:25|On the other side, little [Han Xue], Aunt Liu, and Grandma are walking on the road.
1:21:30|1:21:32|The aunt smiled and patted the head of little [Han Xue].
1:21:32|1:21:35|At the same time, [Han Xue]'s mother just left her workplace.
1:22:0|1:22:7|During the time when the secretary helped her read quotes to the media, [Han Xue]'s mother wandered aimlessly on the street.
1:22:14|1:22:18|Soon, my boyfriend met the daughter of a high-ranking official.
1:22:31|1:22:35|At this point, I had already had my identity for several months.
1:22:42|1:22:47|Saying that, little [Han Xue] was holding her grandmother and aunt's hands, spreading her feet and running forward.
1:22:47|1:22:51|And [Han Xue]'s mother made her way through the crowd, her steps quickening.
1:23:41|1:23:48|The two of them left the entrance of the city hall. At this moment, [Han Xue]'s mother walked through the crowd and arrived at a lush forest.
1:23:48|1:23:58|She briskly stepped over the scattered dry branches and fallen leaves on the ground, her shadow casting a lonely and slender shape behind her, her vacant gaze moving forward.
1:23:58|1:24:5|Silently all the way, she walked to the edge of the cliff, standing on the lonely strait looking out at the sea, leaving only a slender figure.
1:24:43|1:24:48|[Han Xue]’s mother lowered her eyes and walked step by step in the yellow grass.
1:24:48|1:24:53|She walked against the light, the shadows on her face constantly changing, as if contemplating her origins and destination.
1:24:53|1:24:59|In the end, she stood in front of that familiar garbage bin, the past and the present overlapping before her eyes.
1:24:59|1:25:5|The old, dilapidated trash can stood quietly as usual, with just a few more cracks from the rain.
1:25:5|1:25:11|He suddenly turned his head with a sense of realization, only to find [Han Xue] rushing out to look for him alone.
1:25:11|1:25:22|His body stiffened for a moment, the threads of fate converging before his eyes, collapsing and reappearing, discarded memories, past life, [Han Xue]'s fantasies, mother's guilt.
1:25:25|1:25:30|The earth-shattering call of recognition seemed to bring [Ma Dongmei] back from the clouds to the mortal world.
1:25:30|1:25:39|She staggered, her legs somewhat uncooperative, running towards [Han Xue], then reaching out her hand, embracing this familiar yet unfamiliar child in her arms.
1:25:39|1:25:59|In the faint light of dawn, in the approaching warmth of spring, in the exposure of Han Nai Nai and Liu Auntie's comfort and touch intertwined, this mother and daughter finally embraced each other. [Han Shaofen] embraced [Han Xue] by the waist, lifting her onto her shoulders. [Han Xue] buried her head in her mother's neck, her shoulders gently trembling.
1:25:59|1:26:1|Releasing pent-up emotions.
1:26:1|1:26:5|And at this moment, the soul of [Han Shaofen] barely returned to her body.
1:26:6|1:26:16|His bewildered expression vanished in an instant, his eyes unknowingly moistened at the corners, his entire face wrinkled with excitement, as if releasing the suppressed emotions of the past decade.
1:26:16|1:26:26|Aunt Liu and Grandma Han stood not far away, quietly watching this touching scene. They exchanged a glance in silence, both seeing comfort, peace, and love in each other's eyes.
1:26:27|1:26:34|At this moment, [Han Shaofen] closed her eyes, feeling the warmth of the person in her arms and the burning passion in her heart.
1:26:34|1:26:45|And [Han Xue] also gazed tightly at her mother's face, not knowing how long she had been holding her. Her mother finally put [Han Xue] down, took her hand, and walked slowly and firmly towards the aunt and grandmother.
1:27:3|1:27:10|In Han Nai Nai's shocked dream, [Han Shaofen] actually knelt down and looked up into Nai Nai's eyes.
1:27:27|1:27:30|Grandma pulled him up with all her strength.
