0:2:59|0:3:18|Xiaoyun paid no attention to what [Zhang Daichen] wanted to say, slammed the door shut with a bang, locked the security door, leaned her forehead and body against the door, stood there with dull eyes for a while, then turned around to look around the room, and lowered her head to look at the ground while counting and walking forward.
0:3:27|0:3:52|In the room, a woman with a ring on her ring finger lay in a pool of blood, Jiang Feng walked past her calmly, suddenly stopped, looked up at the clock on the wall, which showed 9:05, then turned and walked past another man's body into the room, she calmly dialed the phone.
0:3:53|0:4:0|The screen suddenly goes black, and the title "Memory Master" appears on the screen in four large characters, and the movie begins.
0:4:1|0:4:21|The male protagonist [Jiang Feng] got up in the middle of the night and walked to the closet alone. He stopped in front of a glass cabinet, lowered his head, pursed his lips, and entered the password in the dark to open the safe. [Jiang Feng] looked around and then secretly reached in and stuffed something inside.
0:4:21|0:4:33|He looked at the contents in the safe for a few seconds, sighed, then closed the safe and walked out. [Jiang Feng] passed by the bed silently where his wife was sleeping.
0:4:33|0:4:51|After he left the room, his wife [Zhang Daichen] slowly opened her eyes. The sky was getting brighter, and in a city in T country with tall buildings, a uniquely shaped building appeared on the screen. [Jiang Feng] was led by a staff member into an operating room.
0:4:57|0:5:3|[Jiang Feng] stood in front of a machine. He turned around and sat on the chair of the machine, slowly closing his eyes.
0:5:12|0:5:19|A circular metal device surrounds the head of [Jiang Feng], and the memory deletion surgery officially begins.
0:5:19|0:5:41|Scenes of black and white flash in Jiang Feng's mind, hands raising glasses in celebration, a divorce agreement, him colliding with his wife Zhang Daichen, papers scattering and floating in the air. He kneels down to pick up the papers, and Zhang Daichen helps him. They share a smile, and it ends with a shot of a page with the title "Night Rain".
0:5:41|0:5:47|The screen flickers and returns to reality. [Jiang Feng] opens his eyes.
0:5:47|0:6:3|The staff reached out and took out the memory chip from the device, [Jiang Feng] shook his head.
0:6:7|0:6:20|[Jiang Feng] raised his left hand, and a staff member drew a tube of blood from the inside of his wrist. [Jiang Feng] glanced at the staff member, who seemed somewhat dazed.
0:6:36|0:6:44|[Jiang Feng] took the metal box from the staff's hand.
0:6:57|0:7:4|[Jiang Feng] slowed down his pace and looked around as he walked out.
0:7:58|0:8:9|The scene was chaotic, with [Jiang Feng] and the female staff beside him crouching on the ground, motionless. The man gradually calmed down, gripping the woman's arm tightly and staring at her intently, then he spoke,
0:8:9|0:8:17|The woman's face was filled with fear as she looked at the man in front of her, who didn't say a word for a long time.
0:8:26|0:8:42|The man had a pleading look on his face, and the woman looked at him and spoke. The woman, with her long hair loose, took a deep breath and weakly said,
0:8:44|0:9:1|[Jiang Feng] looked at the man and woman not far away with a puzzled expression. The man hesitated for a few seconds, then hugged the woman tightly in the hall. Tears rolled down from the woman's eyes as the man held her and spoke,
0:9:7|0:9:32|The man raised his gun-holding right hand to his temple, closed his eyes tightly, and pulled the trigger. Bullets pierced through the temples of the two men, dropping to the ground. The two men embraced and fell down. People scattered in panic. Beside them, [Jiang Feng] seemed to be scared silly, gasping for breath and collapsing on the ground. A broken metal box hung beside him, with memory chips flashing. He then returned home, where his wife [Zhang Daichen] sat silently by the side.
0:10:45|0:11:1|[Jiang Feng] stood with his back to [Zhang Daichen], coldly recounting their past together. The couple stood in silence in the empty living room.
0:11:1|0:11:16|[Jiang Feng] returned to the memory master's operating room again. The operator stood aside manipulating the data. He closed his eyes tightly, lying on the seat of the instrument. The female staff member who had served him before placed the memory chip into the device, and then activated the instrument.
0:11:22|0:11:28|The machinery slowly operates, a drop of blue liquid falls from the device, landing in the right eye of [Jiang Feng].
0:11:28|0:11:35|The liquid disperses, and [Jiang Feng]'s pupils also turn blue. The surgery is over, and the scene shifts to the medical room.
0:12:27|0:12:53|[Jiang Feng] hesitated for a moment before speaking, but was interrupted by [Zhang Daichen] sitting next to him. As the night grew darker, [Jiang Feng] sat at the bedside staring at a bottle of sleeping pills in his hand. He expressionlessly caressed the bottle for a while, then unscrewed the cap and swallowed a pill dry.
0:12:53|0:13:8|Outside the window, the city lights were bright. [Jiang Feng] lay on the sofa in front of the French window and fell asleep deeply. In his dream, a black and white scene suddenly appeared, where he walked into a dilapidated village with dense weeds everywhere.
0:13:8|0:13:23|He walked to a wooden house, took out a key and opened the door. Inside, the woman heard the noise and hurriedly hung up the phone, then turned around to look at him. [Jiang Feng] closed the door and walked into the room, the woman smiled and walked towards him.
0:13:33|0:13:55|[Jiang Feng] finished speaking and walked past the woman to the telephone to make a call. The woman was stunned. After hanging up the phone, [Jiang Feng] raised the water glass in his hand and took a sip of water. Then he turned to the side, remained silent for a moment, and spoke.
0:14:2|0:14:12|The phone rang again, and Hui Lan quickly turned to look at the telephone. [Jiang Feng] lowered his head and walked away from the phone, drinking water while waiting for the other party to make a decision.
0:14:12|0:14:20|Huilan glanced at [Jiang Feng], then quickly stepped forward to unplug the phone line. Holding the phone, she looked up at [Jiang Feng] and spoke.
0:14:22|0:14:28|The scene changes, [Jiang Feng] pushes open the door with a stack of books in his arms, while Huilan is ready to go out with a backpack.
0:14:38|0:15:7|Huilan turned and left, [Jiang Feng] stood at the door blankly, looking a bit lost. The scene then cut to the bathroom, where a man faced the bathtub with his back to the camera, crouching down. Inside the bathtub, there was a person with one hand and one leg hanging outside. The scene switched back to the house entrance, [Jiang Feng] handed a stack of books and a key to Huilan. Huilan raised her hand to take the key, then turned to unlock the door and walked out. [Jiang Feng] stood aside, watching him leave expressionlessly.
0:15:10|0:15:19|The scene cuts again, [Jiang Feng] walks into the bathroom alone, squats beside the bathtub, bows his head to look at it, only to see the bathtub filled with water, inside lies a dead body.
0:15:19|0:15:34|The body was floating in the water, the face was not visible, only one arm and one leg were exposed. At this moment, Jiang Feng, who was sleeping, suddenly woke up from the nightmare. His eyes widened in fear, and after dawn, Jiang Feng returned to the hospital again.
0:16:13|0:16:20|[The doctor] looked at [Jiang Feng] with a disdainful smile, then stood up, leaning over the table with both hands.
0:17:18|0:17:43|[Jiang Feng] stood up instantly, his mind racing with images of Li Huilan's face. He suddenly pushed the [doctor] to the ground. Meanwhile, on the police station's big screen, three photos of Li Huilan covered in bruises were displayed, flashing back to her speaking on the hospital bed.
0:18:16|0:18:21|Officer Shen suddenly walked over, causing Officer Lei to quickly pick up the signed documents from Chen Shanshan and leave.
0:18:33|0:18:55|[Jiang Feng] suddenly appeared in the police station at this moment. He turned his head to look at Chen Shanshan and [Officer Shen] chatting, then saw a photo of Li Huilan on the table. He took a few quick steps forward, bent over to look at the photo on the table. In the photo, Li Huilan's eyes were tightly closed, forehead injured. As soon as Officer Lei turned around, he saw [Jiang Feng] staring blankly at the photo.
0:19:7|0:19:13|[Jiang Feng] took a few hesitant steps with a look of wanting to speak, then turned around to speak to Officer Lei's back.
0:20:7|0:20:13|Officer Shen looked at Jiang Feng without saying a word for a long time, then they entered the interrogation room.
0:20:21|0:20:33|[Jiang Feng] recalled his memories and narrated them, while Officer Lei sat aside taking notes and [Officer Shen] asked questions.
0:20:44|0:20:49|Officer Shen looked up at [Jiang Feng],
0:21:38|0:22:0|Officer Lei finished speaking and then left, closing the door behind him. In the empty interrogation room, two desk lamps were lit. [Jiang Feng] rubbed his eyes alone, and suddenly a new image appeared in his mind: a woman standing on the first floor making a phone call, while [Jiang Feng] stood on the second floor looking down at her.
0:22:20|0:22:43|A long-haired woman with a face full of injuries suddenly stood up from the sofa. Ignoring the attempts to stop her from [Jiang Feng] and her sister, she insisted on walking out. Outside the door, a man was kneeling on the ground, holding his hand, with one finger already chopped off, and the ground was covered in blood.
0:22:51|0:23:13|The woman with long hair stood aside with luggage, nodded by the middle-aged woman referred to as "mom" by the man. The woman moved her mouth but made no sound. The man stood up and spoke to the woman with long hair. He tried to take the bag from her hand, but the woman with long hair stepped back in fear. [Jiang Feng] on the side looked up at them. The man spoke to [Jiang Feng], and [Jiang Feng] looked back at him.
0:23:15|0:23:33|The man drove quickly on the highway with the long-haired woman and [Jiang Feng], who was sitting in the passenger seat. The long-haired woman, with tears in her eyes, trembled and glanced secretly at [Jiang Feng] through the rearview mirror. The man's severed finger was placed in a plastic bag filled with ice and water, but he did not slow down; instead, he accelerated.
0:23:44|0:24:5|A scene of a woman drowning suddenly flashes, followed by a man driving the car out of the alley to the dock, then slamming on the brakes, with half of the car suspended on a high platform. At this moment, the scene flashes again to [Jiang Feng] and a long-haired woman playing in the field. The man gets out of the car alone and goes crazy on the side, while the long-haired woman and [Jiang Feng] sit in the car without moving.
0:24:21|0:24:28|The man slammed the long-haired woman's head against the car, then grabbed her hair and angrily spoke out.
0:24:34|0:24:51|Sitting in the back, [Jiang Feng] was so scared that he wet his pants, still not daring to say a word. The image of a hand with a ring on the ring finger and a bleeding index finger, along with a drowned woman, suddenly appeared in [Jiang Feng]'s mind. He woke up abruptly in the interrogation room and sat there blankly. On the other side, Officer Shen took out a file from the archives and read it as he walked.
0:25:42|0:25:53|Officer Shen glanced at the old man, then handed the wallet to Officer Lei, who walked over to the old man, while Jiang Feng once again entered the interrogation room.
0:26:23|0:26:30|[Jiang Feng] furrowed his brow, trying hard to recall the numbers from his memory.
0:26:38|0:26:44|Officer Lei whispered something in Officer Shen's ear, leaving Jiang Feng looking confused and ready to leave.
0:26:51|0:27:1|The two turned their heads to look at [Officer Shen],
0:27:10|0:27:17|Officer Shen handed the documents to Jiang Feng as he took off his coat and walked out.
0:27:32|0:27:39|The police officer locked the door and left. [Jiang Feng] stood with his back to the door in the cell, with another prisoner in the corner.
0:27:44|0:27:54|[Jiang Feng] glanced at him without saying a word, the criminal next to him looked curious, [Jiang Feng] nodded at him.
0:28:55|0:29:0|The criminal had just sat down, but immediately stood up again, walking up to [Jiang Feng] and staring at him with wide eyes.
0:29:5|0:29:12|[Jiang Feng] sighed, then turned his head and walked to the side, while the criminal looked at him, sneered, and walked behind him.
0:29:16|0:29:27|In the police station, [Officer Shen] and Officer Lei are watching the video from the day of the shooting at the Memory Master Surgery Center on the surveillance footage.
0:29:34|0:29:41|[Jiang Feng] was crouching in front of a black-clad person wearing a hat, as if picking something up, while [Officer Shen] sat back against the table and blinked.
0:29:46|0:29:56|Officer Shen turned and left after speaking. Officer Lei looked at the surveillance footage again, and [Jiang Feng] in the prison once again fell into a black and white dream. Li Huilan opened the door, and [Jiang Feng] stood outside receiving a phone call.
0:30:13|0:30:21|[Jiang Feng] walked towards the house, [Zhang Daichen] hurriedly caught up with her, [Jiang Feng] looked at the wound on [Zhang Daichen]'s head and gently touched her hair.
0:30:21|0:30:33|[Li Huilan] knocked off [Jiang Feng]'s hand, the knocking on the door became more urgent. [Li Huilan] dragged [Jiang Feng] and pushed him upstairs.
0:30:40|0:30:56|[Jiang Feng] was pushed into the room on the second floor. He stood still in front of the door, seemingly listening to the movement downstairs. [Li Huilan] closed the door and went downstairs. She opened the security door, took a step back, and let her husband in. Her husband walked into the room and looked around.
0:30:57|0:31:12|After a moment of silence, Jiang Feng's husband turned around and staggered into the house. He leaned against the wall, glanced back at Jiang Feng, then continued to look around while walking inside, as if searching for something.
0:31:12|0:31:35|[Li Huilan] stood at the door, keeping still with her previous actions. After a few seconds of silence, [Li Huilan]'s husband suddenly went crazy. He violently slammed [Li Huilan] against the wall and she fell to the ground. She lay there in a sorry state, begging for mercy, while her husband grabbed her by the neck and roared.
0:31:40|0:32:6|[Li Huilan] struggled and kicked her husband hard, causing his head to hit the wall and pass out. Terrified, [Li Huilan] quickly ran upstairs. At that moment, [Jiang Feng] also came out of the house, patted [Li Huilan] on the shoulder, then went downstairs to squat beside [Li Huilan]'s husband. He silently reached out to check the man's breathing with his hand as his eyes remained tightly shut.
0:32:14|0:32:19|[Jiang Feng] ran to [Li Huilan]'s side, supporting her shoulder to comfort her. [Li Huilan] collapsed in [Jiang Feng]'s arms, wailing loudly.
0:32:29|0:32:36|[Li Huilan] leaned on [Jiang Feng]'s shoulder and shook her head, then backed out of his arms.
0:32:42|0:32:54|[Jiang Feng] watched as [Li Huilan] helplessly swallowed and then took out his phone from his pocket to make a call. Just as he was about to dial the number, [Li Huilan] shook her head and stopped him.
0:33:5|0:33:21|[Li Huilan] looked at [Jiang Feng] with a pleading expression, as [Jiang Feng] reached out to touch [Li Huilan]'s forehead.
0:33:42|0:34:5|[Jiang Feng] looked a bit sad, [Li Huilan] lowered her head to dodge, [Jiang Feng] didn't leave, but took a step forward to touch [Li Huilan]'s cheek again. Tears welled up in [Jiang Feng]'s eyes as [Li Huilan] looked at him with a helpless bitter smile.
0:34:14|0:34:26|[Li Huilan] pushed away [Jiang Feng]'s hand, [Jiang Feng] looked at her in disbelief, then raised his arm and forcefully pushed [Li Huilan] down the stairs.
0:34:26|0:34:36|[Li Huilan] rolled down the stairs to the first floor, clutching her head and groaning in pain as she lay on the ground. [Jiang Feng] stared at her for a moment, then slowly walked down from upstairs.
0:34:36|0:34:49|[Li Huilan] struggled to get up, her hands on the ground, she turned her head towards the stairs upon hearing [Jiang Feng]'s footsteps. However, she suddenly found her vision becoming blurry, and she crawled forward with effort, as if searching for something.
0:34:49|0:35:15|[Jiang Feng] put on white disposable plastic gloves as he walked downstairs. He approached [Li Huilan], bent down to pick up the wine bottle wrapped in a paper bag on the ground, then raised the bottle and forcefully struck it down towards [Li Huilan]'s head. [Li Huilan] screamed in pain and fell to the ground. [Jiang Feng]'s face was filled with indifference as he turned and walked over to [Li Huilan]'s unconscious husband, bending down to place the wine bottle on the ground.
0:35:15|0:35:26|[Li Huilan] struggled to sit up from the ground and glanced at [Jiang Feng], then with a face full of fear, she sobbed and crawled to the side, while [Jiang Feng] took a few steps forward slowly.
0:35:26|0:35:50|Then stopped in front of [Li Huilan], [Li Huilan] was lying on the ground, hands grabbing [Jiang Feng]'s ankles, looking at him pleadingly. However, [Jiang Feng]'s expression was terrifyingly cold. [Li Huilan] became even more frightened, she let go of his hands and crawled to the side faster. [Jiang Feng] bent down, grabbed [Li Huilan], and forcefully covered her nose and mouth. [Li Huilan] struggled desperately, kicking her legs on the ground and vigorously hitting [Jiang Feng]'s arms.
0:35:50|0:36:0|[Jiang Feng]'s gaze seemed to be lost in the distance, his hands becoming more forceful, [Li Huilan] gradually stopped struggling, her eyes losing their sparkle.
0:36:0|0:36:17|A few tears slid from [Jiang Feng]'s eyes, falling into [Li Huilan]'s eyes. [Li Huilan] slowly closed her eyes, a tear rolled down from the corner of her eye. [Jiang Feng] pressed his face against [Li Huilan]'s head, opened his mouth and cried silently. The scene cut back to the prison.
0:36:17|0:36:31|In reality, [Jiang Feng] had his eyes tightly closed, with a slight frown on his face and tears streaming down. He slowly opened his eyes as he curled up in a corner of the prison, then raised his hand to cover his slightly aching head, while another inmate squatted in front of him.
0:37:7|0:37:22|[Jiang Feng] stoops down to pick up something from the ground. Officer Shen sticks a photo on the glass wall, showing a black-clothed person wearing a hat.
0:38:28|0:38:47|[Jiang Feng] turned sharply to look at the prisoner next to him, his eyes sharp and terrifying. The prisoner was immediately scared into silence, with a frozen smile on his face. The sky outside the prison appeared somewhat misty. The streets were still bustling with traffic. [Officer Shen] stood in silence, lost in thought at Li Huilan's house, when Officer Lei walked over.
0:39:3|0:39:9|Officer Lei chuckled and shook his head.
0:39:14|0:39:28|Officer Shen pointed upstairs, and Officer Lei hurriedly ran upstairs. Officer Shen stood alone at the staircase, looking around. He glanced at the room, then turned and walked to the corner, leaning against the wall and silently watching downstairs.
0:39:28|0:39:41|Officer Lei walked into the second-floor room, opened a drawer and began searching for something. He turned around and looked around, took a step forward, walked to the desk, put his hands on the table, and then pulled out a book called "Silent Bird" from the bookshelf.
0:39:41|0:39:53|At the staircase outside the room, Officer Shen lay on the ground with his head parallel to the floor, looking down along the carpet. Suddenly, Officer Lei jumped in front of Officer Shen with the book he had just held.
0:40:2|0:40:30|Officer Shen was pushed and rolled down the stairs like Li Huilan. He struggled to get up, but as soon as he managed to sit up, he froze. Officer Shen pointed towards the steps while lying on the ground. Seeing this, [Officer Shen] also wiped the smile off his face, walked down the stairs, knelt on one knee, bent down, and picked up something from the gap in the stairs. He pinched it with his fingers, blew on it,
0:40:30|0:40:37|Then he picked up the book that had just rolled down with Officer Lei, the author of the book is [Jiang Feng].
0:40:37|0:40:51|Officer Shen picked up the invisible glasses lens, and Officer Lei knocked on the door next to him. A woman came out, and Officer Lei showed her his police badge, making the woman a little angry.
0:41:50|0:41:56|Mrs. Zhang and [Officer Shen] both turned their gaze to Officer Lei, who was applying ice to reduce the swelling and pain.
0:42:45|0:43:4|Mrs. Zhang sat on the sofa, talking animatedly. Meanwhile, in the prison, [Jiang Feng] was pacing anxiously, while another inmate sat idly by. [Jiang Feng] reached up to touch the back of his head, then sat down next to the inmate. After a moment of silence, he sighed and turned to look at the inmate beside him, hesitated for a moment, and then asked,
0:43:38|0:43:54|The criminal chuckled and shook his tattered work vest, thinking that [Jiang Feng] was joking. However, [Jiang Feng] remained expressionless, his face serious. He moved closer to the criminal, his eyes sharp, and raised his right hand to ask the criminal for something.
0:44:0|0:44:16|The night darkens, the scene shifts from the prison to outside the house, Officer Lei and [Officer Shen] sit in the car. Officer Lei checks the time, takes down the flashing warning light from the roof of the car, and then rolls down the window.
0:44:16|0:44:25|Officer Shen sat in the driver's seat, but instead of rolling down the window, he opened the door and got out. Seeing this, Jiang Feng sighed helplessly.
0:44:28|0:44:36|The scene cuts back to the prison, where a prisoner takes out a very thin blade from the worn-out pocket of his pants and hands it to [Jiang Feng].
0:44:54|0:45:8|[Jiang Feng] did not reply, but instead silently contemplated the blade wrapped in tape in his hand. After a moment, he turned around to face the criminal, held up the blade, and spoke earnestly.
0:45:18|0:45:39|The criminal tried to grab the blade, but [Jiang Feng] held it tightly. Seeing the situation was not going well, the criminal quickly called for help from the police. [Jiang Feng] forcefully shoved the blade into the criminal's mouth, swiftly covering his mouth with both hands. The criminal's face was filled with fear as he struggled desperately on the reclining chair.
0:45:42|0:45:45|Two prison guards ran over, with the criminal being firmly suppressed by [Jiang Feng], his mouth full of blood.
0:45:55|0:46:12|[Jiang Feng] took advantage of the chaos to run out, locking the prison gate behind him. He completely ignored the calls of the guards behind him, without hesitation he lowered his head and walked out. When he reached the office area outside the prison, no one felt anything wrong. As he was about to leave the police station, he suddenly saw his wife [Zhang Daichen].
0:46:34|0:46:37|Shanshan suddenly appeared from behind, hugged [Jiang Feng]'s neck, and knocked him to the ground.
0:47:18|0:47:24|Zhang Daichen had no choice but to give up, while [Jiang Feng] was once again handcuffed by the police in the transparent prison, and [Officer Shen] walked over alone.
0:48:22|0:48:32|[Jiang Feng] turned his head to the side and slowly calmed down. [Officer Shen] looked at him, then walked over to a bench, put his hands in his pockets, and sighed.
0:48:48|0:48:55|Outside the prison, [Zhang Daichen] arrives at the infirmary, where Officer Chen Shan Shan is helping him clean his wounds.
0:49:14|0:49:36|[Zhang Daichen] shook his head slightly, hesitated for a moment, nodded at Chen Shanshan, Officer Shen stood outside the prison cell looking at [Jiang Feng], [Jiang Feng] slowly turned around, he slowly turned his body to look at [Officer Shen],
0:49:48|0:49:52|[Jiang Feng] furrowed his brow, he gave a helpless bitter smile, then spoke,
0:50:8|0:50:25|Officer Shen turned and left the prison after speaking. Jiang Feng stared blankly at Officer Shen's back until the sound of the door closing. He then lay down. The lights in the cell went out, and Jiang Feng closed his eyes. In an instant, he was once again plunged into the black and white dream, back to the night when Li Huilan was murdered.
0:50:25|0:50:33|Li Huilan's husband was pinching her neck and questioning her. [Jiang Feng] was hiding on the second floor alone, afraid to make a sound.
0:50:47|0:50:54|Li Huilan's daughter Li Xiaoyun is waving at him at the door. He turns around and enters Li Xiaoyun's room.
0:51:2|0:51:28|He opened the door ready to go out, but was stopped by Li Xiaoyun shaking her head with tears on her face. [Jiang Feng] closed the door, supported Li Xiaoyun's shoulder, made her sit on the bed, looked into her eyes tenderly and comforted her. [Jiang Feng] put the earphones from Li Xiaoyun's neck onto her head, then stared into her eyes to comfort her, as if time suddenly stopped.
0:51:28|0:51:37|After a moment, [Jiang Feng] shifted his body and suddenly realized that there was another him on his right side staring at Li Xiaoyun.
0:51:40|0:52:1|He was completely stunned, eyes wide open and mouth agape, looking at everything in front of him with great astonishment. He approached the motionless other self and [Li Xiaoyun] sitting on the bed, reaching out to touch [Li Xiaoyun]'s hair, only to find that the hair was as stiff as metal. It turned out that everything in the room had already frozen in time.
0:52:1|0:52:28|[Jiang Feng] turned and left the room to go downstairs. He saw [Li Huilan] lying on the ground with a pool of blood in front of her. Another [Jiang Feng] stood on the side watching him. [Li Huilan]'s husband was in a corner leaning against the wall, his condition unknown. [Jiang Feng] took a few steps forward and a corridor appeared on the wall in an infinite loop. He looked down and the open book on the table also displayed interlocking characters, everything seemed very eerie.
0:52:28|0:52:52|The sound of the door closing, [Jiang Feng] immediately turned around. He saw [Li Xiaoyun] coming down from the second floor. The [Jiang Feng] who killed [Li Huilan] looked up at [Li Xiaoyun] with a blank expression, saying nothing. [Li Xiaoyun] walked down the steps, looking at her mother lying in a pool of blood and her father leaning against the wall in critical condition. She choked up and couldn't speak for a long time. The killer [Jiang Feng] remained silent.
0:52:52|0:52:58|[Jiang Feng] on the other side lowered his head silently. He looked up at [Li Xiaoyun].
0:52:59|0:53:33|[Li Xiaoyun] slowly spoke, with disheveled hair scattered on both sides of her temples. She looked up at [Jiang Feng] standing next to her mother's body and spoke again. The room was quiet, only the sound of the clock hands and [Li Xiaoyun]'s sobbing could be heard. She bent down next to her mother's body, her eyes filled with sadness. [Jiang Feng], the killer, still kept his head down in silence. Suddenly, he turned his head to look at [Zhang Daichen] standing beside him. After a few seconds of eye contact, he flashed a sinister smile at him.
0:53:33|0:53:56|[Jiang Feng] was startled, took a few steps back unsteadily, turned around and ran out. In the instant [Jiang Feng] turned around, the scene quickly switched to the seaside, where the long-haired woman with a face full of wounds that he had dreamed of before was standing in the water smiling at him. At this moment, the long-haired woman had no wounds on her face. She put her hand in the water and randomly picked up a small goldfish.
0:53:56|0:54:0|The goldfish floated in the air above her hands, looking very magical.
0:54:0|0:54:30|The goldfish danced in the air, flying from the hands of the woman with long hair to [Jiang Feng]. Suddenly, the woman's husband appeared and they started fighting. [Jiang Feng] rushed forward to intervene, but not only did he fail to stop the woman's husband's violence, he was also pushed underwater by the man. He struggled in the water, using all his strength to lift his head above the surface, but before he could even catch his breath, he was pushed back underwater again.
0:54:30|0:54:37|[Jiang Feng] struggled less and less, and just when his life was hanging by a thread, he suddenly left the water and stood up from the bathtub.
0:54:44|0:55:5|[Jiang Feng] was in a mess, gasping for breath as he looked around. He realized he was in the bathroom he had dreamed of before. Suddenly, he turned around and saw another himself standing in front of the bathtub, looking down at the body inside. Walking to the bathtub, he glanced at the motionless other [Jiang Feng] beside it, then lowered his head to look at the body in the bathtub.
0:55:5|0:55:12|Bending down, Jiang Feng reached out and touched the water in the bathtub, which was filled with white foam. The water turned into a solid, everything frozen in place.
0:55:12|0:55:34|He was a little scared and wanted to run out of the bathroom, but when he turned around, he saw the same bathroom with the same scene. Countless bathrooms, countless Jiang Fengs, countless bathtubs and bodies lined up there. He felt fear, running and shuttling in countless bathrooms. Suddenly, he stopped and walked to the mirror behind him, staring for a moment, raising his hand to wipe away the mist.
0:55:34|0:56:2|A terrifying scene unfolds as the mirror only reflects a dilapidated bathroom. [Jiang Feng], standing in front of the mirror, does not see himself and is startled. He quickly runs backward, and the scene starts spinning as a rapid knocking sound echoes in his ears.
0:56:6|0:56:17|Officer Shen anxiously pounded on the transparent glass of the cell, Jiang Feng woke up from a deep sleep, sweating profusely, obviously frightened by everything that happened in the dream.
0:56:17|0:56:21|He struggled to sit up on the bed and talked to [Officer Shen] about the scenes in his dream.
0:56:30|0:56:36|[Jiang Feng] was stunned for a moment,
0:57:29|0:57:36|Officer Shen looked somewhat puzzled, Jiang Feng sighed, then raised his hands to rub his eyes.
0:57:40|0:57:50|As the day broke, [Zhang Daichen] heard the doorbell and opened the door to find Officer Shen standing outside.
0:58:0|0:58:17|[Zhang Daichen] led Chen Shanshan into the room, then walked to the refrigerator with ointment in hand. She took out a bottle of drink from the refrigerator, and then turned around to get a cup.
0:58:34|0:58:42|Chen Shanshan placed the ticket on the table, then picked up a glass and took a sip of her drink.
0:59:0|0:59:8|As the sky darkens, Officer Shen and Officer Lei arrive at the library. Officer Lei bends down while walking, searching for Jiang Feng's figure.
0:59:19|0:59:26|Sitting on both sides of [Jiang Feng], [Zhang Daichen] and [Officer Shen] tried to engage in conversation, but [Jiang Feng] was too focused on his homework to respond.
1:0:20|1:0:37|The two officers left the library, eating and chatting. Officer Shen picked up some ketchup and added it to his food, while Officer Jiang Feng pondered over Officer Shen's question as he ate.
1:0:57|1:1:4|On the other side, [Zhang Daichen], who was staying at home, was sitting in the dining room talking on the phone with a lawyer.
1:1:8|1:1:15|[Zhang Daichen] hung up the phone and let out a sigh of relief. [Officer Shen] and Officer Lei returned to the police station, sitting in the interrogation room waiting.
1:1:24|1:1:57|Officer Shen crossed his legs and leaned back in the chair, as if someone was coming. A prison guard led in a man wearing gloves and ankle shackles, Li Hang, who ignored Officer Lei. Officer Lei knocked on the table, and Li Hang slowly raised his head.
1:2:28|1:2:39|[Li Hang] calmly answered Officer Lei's questions, leaving Officer Lei momentarily speechless. Officer Shen, sitting beside him, stared at [Li Hang] for a moment before sitting up straight and asking.
1:2:41|1:2:44|[Li Hang] sat at the table without saying a word, not answering Officer Shen's question.
1:2:44|1:3:10|Officer Shen waited for a while, then spoke again, but Li Hang still remained silent. Officer Lei, feeling impatient, saw Li Hang lower his head and blink his eyes, move his head slightly, but he still looked lifeless. Officer Lei, feeling helpless, covered his head, while Officer Shen lowered his head and tapped the table with a pen.
1:3:13|1:3:32|Officer Shen suddenly stopped his actions and asked, Jiang Feng slowly raised his head to look at Officer Shen, who was also looking at him. They stared at each other for a while. Jiang Feng moved his lips, widened his eyes, and then slowly spoke,
1:3:33|1:3:56|He blinked and stared at [Officer Shen] without blinking, then smirked. [Li Hang] and [Officer Shen] locked eyes for a moment, then turned away. His expression was numb and sad, with tears seemingly rolling in his eyes but not falling. The scene gradually darkened from color to black and white.
1:3:56|1:4:18|[Jiang Feng] and the long-haired woman from before were playing and chasing each other in the wheat field. However, happiness is always short-lived. The long-haired woman, who was laughing moments ago, suddenly lay in the bathtub with a face full of scars. Jiang Feng reached out to touch the wound at the corner of her eye, leaving a trace of blood on his hand. The faucet next to them kept dripping water, and tears also fell from the long-haired woman's right eye.
1:4:18|1:4:36|She sat in the bathtub in silence, constantly rubbing her thumb and index finger together, bloodstains on her hands. [Jiang Feng] walked to the cabinet upon hearing this, reaching out in an attempt to grab the medicine bottle on the top shelf. He tried many times but still couldn't reach it.
1:4:36|1:4:52|He bent down in frustration and moved the low stool next to the cabinet, stepping on it to reach for the medicine bottle. At this height, he could just reach it. He picked up a bottle of painkillers, looked at it, then put it back. He pushed something inside the cabinet, then picked up another bottle, which contained sleeping pills.
1:4:54|1:5:19|[Li Hang] walked into the bathroom with pills and a cup of water in his hand. He stood by the bathtub, looked down at the pills and water, pursed his lips, and then handed the pills and cup to the long-haired woman lying in the bathtub. The woman took the pills without hesitation, and [Jiang Feng] stood by, lips slightly parted, with a hesitant expression. Her breathing became more and more rapid. The long-haired woman raised her right hand and held [Jiang Feng]'s hand, signaling him to leave.
1:5:20|1:5:25|[Jiang Feng] held the hand of the woman with long hair for a while, then let go and slowly moved away step by step.
1:5:25|1:5:53|He walked to the door, looked back at the woman with long hair in the bathtub, then turned and closed the door. [Jiang Feng] did not completely close the door, but stood at the doorway, looking inside through a wide gap. Tears kept falling from the woman's face, she sighed, then closed her eyes and lay down in the bathtub to rest. With tears and bruises all over her body, she gradually fell asleep, her body slowly sinking down, and soon slipped into the bathtub filled with water.
1:5:53|1:6:16|[Jiang Feng] stood outside the door, watching everything happening in the bathroom. He saw with his own eyes the long-haired woman's head gradually being submerged by water. He stood outside the door, choked up, then quickly covered his mouth with his hand. The long-haired woman in the bathroom was completely lying in the water, and a few seconds later she began to struggle. Bubbles kept appearing from her mouth and nose as she desperately tried to break free from the water, but to no avail.
1:6:16|1:6:25|[Jiang Feng] outside the bathroom, covering his mouth in sorrow, watched helplessly as the long-haired woman struggled in the bathtub until there was no movement in the tub.
1:6:25|1:6:54|He then walked into the bathroom and approached the bathtub, where an arm and a leg were sticking out of the water. [Jiang Feng] looked sadly at the body of the woman with long hair sinking in the water. Drop by drop, blood slipped from his palm into the tub. He squatted beside it, arms on the edge of the tub, crying uncontrollably. In his mind flashed images of himself and the long-haired woman with a face full of wounds cuddling in a wheat field. The scene suddenly shifted between black and white dreams and reality.
1:6:54|1:7:9|Jiang Feng, who woke up from a dream, sat at his desk flipping through files desperately. He looked very focused as he examined photos of various female corpses scattered all over the desk and floor.
1:7:9|1:7:14|Officer Shen walked in with a teapot and stood in front of Jiang Feng, pouring tea as he spoke.
1:7:31|1:7:38|Officer Shen sat down and bent over, picking up a teacup to drink tea in front of Jiang Feng.
1:7:51|1:8:2|Officer Shen turned his body to the side and pondered for a moment, then turned to look at Jiang Feng.
1:8:6|1:8:12|[Jiang Feng] felt a headache and he leaned on the table.
1:8:56|1:9:3|Officer Shen snatched the documents.
1:9:11|1:9:33|[Jiang Feng] was taken out forcefully by the prison guard who walked in with a face full of anger, while on the other side, [Zhang Daichen], dressed up carefully, arrived at the music hall. Officer Shen ran a few steps to catch up with [Zhang Daichen] and patted him on the back. The two of them walked hand in hand upstairs to the police station office.
1:9:44|1:9:56|The scene returns to the music hall, where Chen Shanshan and [Zhang Daichen] found their seats and sat down. [Zhang Daichen] sighed, hesitated for a moment, looked around, then turned to Chen Shanshan and spoke.
1:10:7|1:10:15|Chen Shanshan agreed to Zhang Daichen's request, and Zhang Daichen smiled, looking a bit embarrassed.
1:10:32|1:10:43|Chen Shanshan smiled and glanced at [Zhang Daichen], who seemed hesitant to speak. However, [Zhang Daichen] turned his head at that moment and focused on the concert that had just begun.
1:10:45|1:10:55|On the other side, [Jiang Feng] was standing alone in the prison at this moment. He was facing the transparent glass wall of the cell, bowing his head in contemplation. The sound of the door opening could be heard.
1:10:55|1:11:4|A prison guard left, and [Jiang Feng] turned to look at him as the guard closed the gate, then walked to the workbench and bowed his head to record something. [Jiang Feng] watched him.
1:11:4|1:11:10|With his hands hanging down, [Jiang Feng] walked to the other side of the cell, then turned around and spoke to [Officer Shen].
1:11:11|1:11:25|The prison guard stopped his hand movement, turned his head to look, then reluctantly put down the pen in his hand, stood up and walked towards the office with the light on the side. The guard picked up a disposable paper cup to help [Jiang Feng] get some water.
1:11:25|1:11:34|[Jiang Feng] looked at the prison guard walking into the office and then glanced thoughtfully at the half blade wrapped in plastic tape that appeared out of nowhere in his hand.
1:11:34|1:11:47|Upon hearing the footsteps of the prison guard, he quickly put down the blade hidden in his hand. The guard opened a small window and handed him a cup of water. He took the cup and stepped back, then raised the blade in his hand in front of the guard.
1:11:47|1:12:18|The prison guard stared at him, his eyes widening in panic. [Jiang Feng] looked at the flustered guard expressionlessly, then slowly opened his mouth, putting the blade into his mouth in front of him. He raised his right hand holding a paper cup and took a sip of water. The guard, completely panicked, hurried to the password lock at the door of the cell and opened it. [Jiang Feng] forcefully swallowed the blade in his mouth, then suddenly bent over and knelt on the ground. He covered his chest, blood flowing from his mouth, his face filled with pain as he weakly collapsed to the ground.
1:12:27|1:12:36|[Jiang Feng] lay in the ambulance howling in pain, he saw a pair of medical scissors on the shelf. A police officer approached the ambulance humming a tune, as soon as he opened the door, he saw Li Hang holding a doctor hostage with the scissors.
1:12:51|1:13:4|[Jiang Feng] forcefully pressed the scissors against the doctor's neck, causing the police officer to surrender. The officer stood still for a few seconds, then threw his gun away and raised his hands, looking at [Jiang Feng].
1:13:10|1:13:18|The police officer nodded, took out handcuffs from behind and dangled them in front of [Jiang Feng], then handcuffed himself first, and then handcuffed himself to the doctor.
1:13:22|1:13:38|[Jiang Feng] forcefully stabbed the doctor's neck with the scissors, scaring [Doctor] to death. [Officer Shen] voluntarily extended his left arm, and [Doctor] tremblingly picked up the syringe and injected the needle into [Officer Shen]'s arm, pushing the medicine in.
1:13:41|1:14:4|[Jiang Feng] took out the doctor's phone from his pocket, took off his hat and ran backwards. The officer next to him tried to catch up, but the hand that was leaning against the doctor stopped him. He took out the key to unlock the handcuffs, but the sedative had clearly taken effect, and he couldn't open the handcuffs no matter how hard he tried. Frustrated, he threw away the key and gave up. In the blink of an eye, [Jiang Feng] had run far away.
1:14:4|1:14:28|While quietly enjoying the music with Chen Shanshan, [Zhang Daichen] took out her vibrating phone and glanced at it. She received a call from an unknown number. After hesitating for a few seconds, she looked around and put the phone to her ear, covering her mouth as she answered the call. It turned out to be a call from [Jiang Feng], who had just escaped to the overpass.
1:14:49|1:15:19|The phone was suddenly hung up, [Zhang Daichen] felt a bit puzzled. Chen Shanshan beside him heard the movement and spoke up. [Zhang Daichen] shook his head. She concealed the news from her husband. As the night grew darker, [Jiang Feng] walked unsteadily on the overpass, leaning on the railing. He took a few steps, then squatted on the ground and started retching. While retching, he forcefully dug at his throat, saliva mixed with blood dripping from his mouth onto the back of his hand. He painfully lowered his head and finally pulled the blade out of his throat.
1:15:19|1:15:26|The scene returns to the police station office, [Officer Shen] enters the room and finds Officer Lei watching the surveillance footage.
1:15:43|1:15:49|Officer Lei turned to look at [Officer Shen],
1:16:4|1:16:33|Officer Shen remained silent for a while, which made Officer Lei chuckle. There was another possible relationship between the suspect and the victim. He wrote a few words on a sticky note, tore it off, and stuck it on the glass. The note read "best friends." Officer Shen put his hands on his hips and took a few steps forward, staring at the sticky note on the glass. Before he could speak, the scene suddenly shifted from a photo of Li Huilan to a black and white past.
1:16:39|1:16:58|Chen Shanshan went from Li Huilan's house to the bathroom of the woman with long hair in the blink of an eye. Then she appeared in front of Li Xiaoyun, helping her put on headphones, and then comforting Li Huilan by hugging her.
1:17:0|1:17:7|Li Huilan cried in front of Chen Shanshan, then suddenly pushed her away.
1:17:18|1:17:41|Chen Shanshan pushed Li Huilan from the second floor, then put on a pair of white disposable plastic gloves. She was standing in front of the bathtub looking at the body of the woman with long hair one second, and the next second she was in Li Huilan's house picking up a bottle of alcohol to smash towards the other person. The scene returns to reality, [Jiang Feng] hides in the corridor waiting for his wife to arrive.
1:17:45|1:18:3|Chen Shanshan accompanied [Zhang Daichen] down the stairs towards the exit, while [Jiang Feng] hid behind a pillar watching them. He quietly took a few steps forward, then hid behind another pillar and took out his phone. He dialed a number he had seen at the police station from memory, which happened to be the number Li Huilan had called before her death.
1:18:3|1:18:12|The last call, coincidentally, was from Jiang Feng.
1:18:14|1:18:25|[Jiang Feng] immediately hung up the phone upon seeing this, Chen Shanshan put her phone back in her bag, [Jiang Feng] emerged from behind the pillar.
1:18:45|1:18:49|[Jiang Feng] grabbed his wife and ran outside. Chen Shanshan felt something was wrong and took out her phone to follow.
1:19:2|1:19:16|Chen Shanshan answered the phone that had just called, only to find that [Jiang Feng]'s phone was ringing. [Jiang Feng] continued to walk forward.
1:19:37|1:19:45|[Zhang Daichen] stood in front of Chen Shanshan, pushed away [Jiang Feng], and [Jiang Feng] menacingly interrogated his wife.
1:20:35|1:20:43|[Zhang Daichen] hid behind Chen Shanshan, almost crying out of fear, while [Jiang Feng] was being restrained by several security guards on the side, his expression filled with disbelief.
1:20:55|1:21:6|Officer Lei finished speaking and turned to leave, but after a few steps, he stopped. He turned back to look at [Zhang Daichen].
1:21:6|1:21:13|After a moment of contemplation, Officer Lei turned around and walked away.
1:21:15|1:21:21|[Zhang Daichen] sighed deeply, rubbed his neck, turned his head and sat down on the steps.
1:21:21|1:21:29|Chen Shanshan looked at the disheveled [Zhang Daichen] with a worried expression, reached out to adjust the backpack on her shoulder, and then squatted down beside her to offer comfort.
1:21:44|1:21:50|[Zhang Daichen], after a moment of contemplation, turned his head to look at the hopeful Chen Shanshan and refused.
1:21:54|1:22:1|[Jiang Feng] returned to the prison, sitting on a chair despondently, pondering something. [Officer Shen] opened the door and walked over to look at him.
1:22:15|1:22:23|Officer Shen nodded.
1:22:31|1:22:44|[Jiang Feng] questioned [Officer Shen] with anger, [Officer Shen] looked at him, then squatted down, rubbed his face with both hands, and looked up at [Jiang Feng].
1:22:49|1:23:7|Officer Shen remained crouched on the ground, looking at Jiang Feng. Jiang Feng raised his eyes and raised his eyebrows upon hearing Officer Shen's words, his eyes full of complexity. After a moment of hesitation, he spoke.
1:23:8|1:23:12|[Jiang Feng] closed his eyes, a tear rolling down from his left eye.
1:23:12|1:23:26|[Zhang Daichen] left the police station and returned home. She tied up her hair and stood in front of the transparent glass cabinet in the cloakroom for a few seconds, then suddenly turned around. She hesitated for a moment with her back facing the cabinet where the safe was placed, her mind lost in thought.
1:23:26|1:23:33|After a moment, she seemed to have figured it out, turned around, entered the password, and opened the safe.
1:23:39|1:23:55|She opened the small iron door of the safe, inside there was a letter and a DV player. The envelope was labeled with three words for [Jiang Feng]. [Zhang Daichen] took out the letter and DV from the cabinet and started watching them alone.
1:24:22|1:24:33|[Zhang Daichen] laughed while watching the DV, reminiscing about the past, as [Jiang Feng] and his wife held hands and looked at house loans.
1:25:49|1:25:53|[Zhang Daichen] sits on the bed giving herself an injection, while [Jiang Feng] stands behind her, holding her.
1:26:2|1:26:8|[Zhang Daichen] looked haggard, tears in her eyes, while [Jiang Feng] had a pained expression on his face.
1:26:14|1:26:22|Tears slid from [Zhang Daichen]'s eyes as [Jiang Feng] embraced her shoulder.
1:26:33|1:26:43|[Zhang Daichen] turned his head in astonishment and stared at [Jiang Feng], who was at a loss for words. The scene then switched to [Jiang Feng] sitting alone in front of the computer, writing a script, muttering something under his breath.
1:26:43|1:26:46|[Zhang Daichen] hummed a song as he walked up to the refrigerator,
1:26:51|1:27:7|[Zhang Daichen] opens the refrigerator, then turns to look at [Jiang Feng] sitting in front of the desk lamp. She grabs a drink and says to [Jiang Feng],
1:27:21|1:27:27|[Zhang Daichen] held up the book in front of [Jiang Feng], who seemed a little unhappy.
1:27:41|1:27:54|[Zhang Daichen] looked at [Jiang Feng] with his head tilted, but [Jiang Feng], sitting in front of the computer, remained silent. [Zhang Daichen] opened a bottle of red wine and raised the bottle, saying.
1:27:56|1:28:3|She lifted the wine bottle and took a big sip directly from the mouth of the bottle, then spoke intermittently.
1:28:6|1:28:24|She walked step by step to [Jiang Feng] and asked her, but [Jiang Feng] just looked at the computer in front of her, not even looking at her, still silent. After waiting for a few seconds, [Zhang Daichen] reached out and directly closed the laptop screen in front of her silent husband.
1:28:24|1:28:27|[Jiang Feng] did not stop his wife's actions.
1:28:42|1:29:7|[Zhang Daichen] had a smile on his face, but tears filled his eyes. Upon hearing his wife's question, [Jiang Feng] finally looked up at her. His expression was very complex, eyes wide open, lips moving, but he couldn't say a word, only a helpless sigh could be heard. The scene returned to reality, with [Jiang Feng] sitting alone in a transparent cell, staring blankly as the lights in the prison went out.
1:29:7|1:29:13|He still maintained his original posture, pondering something, sitting in the same position all night.
1:29:14|1:29:20|After daybreak, he left the cell and entered the office of the police station. A sketch artist was drawing a portrait based on his description.
1:29:30|1:29:52|After the sketch was completed, [Jiang Feng] got into the car with Officer Lei, while Officer Shen handed a document to [Jiang Feng] outside the car. Officer Lei gave a thumbs up to Officer Shen, who then smiled at [Jiang Feng]. [Jiang Feng] smiled back, but his expression appeared somewhat worried.
1:30:1|1:30:10|[Zhang Daichen] felt much better. However, Chen Shanshan seemed a bit hesitant.
1:31:0|1:31:8|[Zhang Daichen] looked serious, but Chen Shanshan seemed somewhat skeptical.
1:31:19|1:31:27|Chen Shanshan brought [Zhang Daichen] to the old house, where there was a large chandelier hanging from the ceiling and many things piled up on the floor.
1:31:36|1:32:1|Chen Shanshan just smiled and didn't say anything. [Zhang Daichen] stood alone in the living room. She saw a group photo, with the long-haired woman that [Jiang Feng] had dreamed of, along with her mother and sister. [Zhang Daichen] followed Chen Shanshan to the back of the old house, where there was a dense patch of weeds outside, and across the weeds was another old house.
1:32:1|1:32:14|And this house is the one that [Jiang Feng] initially dreamed of, where Li Huilan used to live. [Zhang Daichen] stood next to Chen Shanshan, oblivious, while [Jiang Feng] once again arrived at the Memory Master Surgery Center.
1:32:16|1:32:47|He lay on the machine just as the surgery was about to begin, and the black and white memories flashed in his mind once again. He dreamed of the long-haired woman drowning in the bathtub, and he dreamed of himself squatting beside the bathtub crying. He looked up and saw a little boy in the mirror next to the bathtub. [Jiang Feng] in front of the mirror looked surprised. He saw the man with the severed finger planning to take the long-haired woman away, while a little boy held onto him, not wanting him to leave. [Jiang Feng] saw the little boy standing on a stool, tears in his eyes, taking a bottle of medicine from the cabinet.
1:32:47|1:32:51|Seeing the long-haired woman drawing a goldfish on her hand to cheer up the boy,
1:32:53|1:33:9|He saw the long-haired woman being beaten by her husband, the boy trembling in the back seat, etc. [Jiang Feng] stopped the surgery and ran out of the operating room alone, [Officer Shen] stopped him in the corridor.
1:33:24|1:33:31|The scene shifts to the old house of Chen Shanshan. [Zhang Daichen] walks into a dilapidated room, with Chen Shanshan closing the door behind her.
1:33:48|1:33:55|Chen Shanshan snatched Zhang Daichen's phone, the call was terminated, Jiang Feng was completely panicked,
1:34:3|1:34:17|Officer Lei hung up the phone and looked for Jiang Feng, only to find that he had already disappeared. Chen Shanshan and Zhang Daichen turned their heads to look outside at the same time, while Jiang Feng had also gotten into a taxi at that moment.
1:35:0|1:35:8|Xiaoyun ignored Officer Lei's questions, got off the car and ran. Officer Lei hurriedly got off the car and ran around the elderly person in front of the car door to stop Xiaoyun.
1:35:21|1:35:43|The old man held up the portrait of the long-haired woman that Officer Shen had dropped on the ground and asked, as night fell, a white car sped down the road. In the blink of an eye, Jiang Feng arrived in the village where Chen Shanshan lived by taxi. Getting out of the car, Jiang Feng rushed inside, swiftly weaving through the village among the weeds. In no time, he arrived at the door of Chen Shanshan's old house.
1:35:43|1:36:5|A small house was lit up, while the adjacent big house was pitch black. [Jiang Feng] glanced at the door, then rushed into the big house. Inside, he saw [Officer Shen] sitting as if injured, with Chen Shanshan lying in the hay nearby in an unknown condition. Not finding his wife around, he immediately started questioning [Officer Shen].
1:36:53|1:36:58|[Jiang Feng] saw his wife lying motionless on the ground, and he completely lost it.
1:36:58|1:37:6|He snatched Officer Shen's gun, holding it with both hands pointed at Officer Shen, who was writhing on the ground holding his leg.
1:37:33|1:37:43|He chambered a round in the pistol, turned and aimed at Chen Shanshan lying on the ground. Just as [Jiang Feng] was about to pull the trigger, he suddenly realized something was wrong.
1:37:43|1:37:52|Officer Shen suddenly launched an attack on Jiang Feng, and the scene flashed back to Officer Shen sitting in the memory master's operating room for surgery, revealing that the black-clothed man in the surveillance footage was him.
1:38:6|1:38:21|Officer Shen intentionally had Chen Shanshan bring Zhang Daichen to the old house, and it was still him who pushed Li Huilan down the stairs and suffocated her to death.
1:38:21|1:38:40|He crouched on the ground tightly hugging Li Huilan, one hand wearing a white plastic glove tightly covering the other's mouth and nose. Li Huilan gradually stopped all resistance from intense struggling, losing consciousness gradually as her life slipped away. Large tears streamed from Officer Shen's eyes, dripping into Li Huilan's eyes.
1:38:40|1:38:47|Li Huilan slowly closed her eyes, a tear fell down, unable to tell whose tear it was anymore.
1:38:47|1:38:58|The scene returns to reality, with [Jiang Feng] and [Officer Shen] wrestling on the ground. After enduring a long period of being beaten unilaterally, [Jiang Feng] finally rises up to resist and is no longer at a disadvantage.
1:38:58|1:39:7|He picked up a wooden stick with a nail on the ground and fiercely hit Officer Shen's leg. Both of them fell to the ground, with scars on their faces and their clothes in tatters.
1:39:7|1:39:19|[Officer Shen] is lying on the ground, with [Jiang Feng] pressing on top of him, firmly pressing a wooden stick with nails and glass shards in his hand on his neck. [Officer Shen] is struggling desperately on the ground.
1:39:19|1:39:33|In the moment of life and death, memories of childhood suddenly flashed through [Officer Shen]'s mind. He saw a little boy crying incessantly, covering his mouth while standing aside crying, then squatting by the bathtub wailing loudly, and silently sobbing with tears streaming down his face.
1:39:33|1:39:38|[Officer Shen] stared with wide eyes, as if already immersed in memories, giving up resistance.
1:39:38|1:39:46|[Jiang Feng] looked at [Officer Shen], who was completely motionless and not struggling, gradually relaxed his actions, and then let out a sigh of relief.
1:39:46|1:39:50|Officer Shen's mind replayed the black and white footage.
1:39:50|1:39:59|The little boy who was crying just now is now playing and frolicking in the field with the long-haired woman. They then sit in the house chatting.
1:40:7|1:40:13|The long-haired woman helps the little boy clean the wound on his hand, but the boy is not happy. The woman gives the boy a glance.
1:40:17|1:40:25|The woman with long hair held the hand of the little boy in silence for a moment, then reached out to embrace his head. Their foreheads touched as they smiled, and the woman with long hair said,
1:40:32|1:40:48|Upon hearing the boy's words, the smile on the long-haired woman's face gradually disappeared. She slowly sat up, looking at the stern-faced little boy. The long-haired woman got up and left. The scene suddenly switched to the bathtub, where the little boy was crying and apologizing.
1:40:50|1:41:11|In the gradually overlapping memories and reality, the once lifeless Officer Shen suddenly opened his eyes wide. He silently reached out and picked up a wooden stick, smashing it towards Jiang Feng's head. Jiang Feng was instantly knocked unconscious, the screen suddenly turned black, as if everything had fallen into silence. After a long period of darkness, a dazzling light flashed by.
1:41:11|1:41:18|Chen Shanshan was shining a flashlight directly at [Jiang Feng], while [Zhang Daichen] also walked over from the side.
1:41:20|1:41:56|[Jiang Feng] lay on the ground, with Chen Shanshan and [Zhang Daichen] squatting beside him. [Jiang Feng] struggled to sit up, then excitedly embraced his wife. The couple sat on the ground hugging tightly. Chen Shanshan looked at Officer Shen at the door, his face full of worry. [Jiang Feng], covered in blood, turned to look at Officer Shen outside the door, who remained motionless.
1:41:56|1:42:4|Not long after, Officer Shen suddenly turned around and prepared to come in. Jiang Feng quickly put his hand on his wife's shoulder, stood in front of her, and comforted her.
1:42:5|1:42:16|Officer Shen walked in from the door, holding a gun in his right hand, his clothes stained with blood and dirt. He stood in the room, looking at the three people not far away, sighed, and then spoke,
1:42:26|1:42:36|[Officer Shen] is full of unwillingness between the lines.
1:43:14|1:43:18|[Zhang Daichen] pushed her husband behind her and stood up directly in front of Officer Shen's gun.
1:43:26|1:43:33|[Zhang Daichen] did not step aside, but took another step towards the barrel.
1:43:51|1:44:17|[Zhang Daichen] said nothing, just looked at [Officer Shen] with eyes filled with tears. [Officer Shen]'s hand was shaking, and he suddenly saw many images in his mind. He saw his manuscript being knocked away by [Zhang Daichen], with countless papers scattered everywhere. He squatted on the steps, looked up and locked eyes with [Zhang Daichen], as if love at first sight, as if timeless. He also saw [Zhang Daichen], who had been drinking, leaning on the table and questioning himself.
1:44:44|1:44:58|Officer Shen's mind was filled with memories of Jiang Feng, his hand holding the gun was trembling, tears welled up in his eyes. Suddenly, memories of himself and Li Huilan flashed through his mind.
1:45:9|1:45:17|After a gunshot, Officer Lei suddenly appeared at the door, with [Officer Shen] standing there holding his arm.
1:45:50|1:45:57|[Officer Shen] leaned against the wall with a look of regret and relief. He remained silent, his eyes fixed on something unknown.
1:45:57|1:46:5|It seems like he is still immersed in his own world. [Officer Shen] stands aside watching him, with a complex expression on his face, as the scene gradually darkens.
1:46:5|1:46:22|The ambulance swiftly navigated on the bridge, and [Jiang Feng] lying inside slowly woke up. He looked around and saw [Zhang Daichen] already asleep by the window on his left. He tried to move but accidentally made too much noise, waking the other person up.
1:46:22|1:46:32|[Zhang Daichen] heard the movement and woke up, she quickly got up and quietly helped [Jiang Feng] up.
1:46:41|1:47:6|[Jiang Feng] struggled to sit next to [Zhang Daichen], holding her hand and looking at her affectionately. He watched as his wife, with disheveled hair and blood on her face, raised her left hand to tidy up her hair. He looked at his slightly disheveled wife and apologized.
1:47:12|1:47:26|[Jiang Feng] looked apologetic, while [Zhang Daichen] gazed up at her husband with tenderness in her eyes. They shared a deep gaze, and then she suddenly spoke to her husband.
