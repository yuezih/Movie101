0:2:6|0:2:14|Yuan Shuai then staggered up the stairs on the side, a white beast appeared in the alley. He ran to the rooftop and crouched behind a large potted banana tree, holding his head.
0:2:14|0:2:19|He cautiously observed his surroundings while tiptoeing on the balcony filled with clothes.
0:2:19|0:2:26|The shadow of a beast is imprinted on the hanging sheets, [Yuan Shuai] suddenly quickens his pace, pushing aside the dense sheets on the rooftop and running forward.
0:2:26|0:2:37|He suddenly stopped in his tracks, eyes wide with fear, gritting his teeth as he turned back to try to grab the clothesline. To his surprise, the rope snapped, and he swung his arms, along with the miscellaneous items on the rooftop, falling off the rooftop.
0:3:8|0:3:14|As soon as the words fell, the neon sign "The Second Generation Fairy: Lucky to Have You in This Life" appeared on the top floor.
0:3:15|0:3:18|36 hours ago,
0:5:2|0:5:10|[Yuan Shuai] walked away quickly after speaking, and the rich woman threw a spoon at the back of [Yuan Shuai]'s head. He stopped, turned around, and the spoon, covered in cream, slid off his hair. He approached the rich woman.
0:5:18|0:5:24|The rich woman sat down in fear on the chair, [Yuan Shuai] raised the cream cake and glared at her fiercely, while other customers in the western restaurant were all watching them.
0:5:24|0:5:36|The scene shifts to the bustling metropolis, with landmarks such as the Shanghai Center, the Global Financial Center, the Golden Trade Building, and the Oriental Pearl Tower coming into view. [Yuan Shuai] is dressed in a sharp suit.
0:5:36|0:5:41|Carrying a cake, [Yuan Shuai] walked onto the overpass with heavy steps, brushing past hurried pedestrians.
0:5:41|0:5:48|In the center of Shanghai, skyscrapers stand tall, intertwined with old-fashioned small Western-style buildings full of local flavor.
0:5:50|0:5:53|[Yuan Shuai] walked into a bustling alley, where the atmosphere was filled with a strong sense of the common people.
0:5:53|0:6:1|Some people were eating at a snack stall, while others were tending to the plants in flower pots. When he passed by a wonton shop, [Yuan Shuai] stopped.
0:6:1|0:6:16|A girl in a white dress with long flowing hair sits on the windowsill of the second floor, one leg dangling outside, her gaze following [Yuan Shuai].
0:6:31|0:6:37|Along the way, he passed by Lion Mountain, walked onto a small bridge, and under the bridge, there was a huge golden koi swimming freely in the river.
0:6:37|0:6:44|After crossing the small bridge, he opened the door designated for staff only. As he walked on, it seemed like he heard some strange noises again.
0:6:44|0:6:46|He gradually stopped and looked back.
0:6:46|0:6:55|Just now, the girl in white appeared again, she was lying on the glass roof above his head, [Yuan Shuai] turned his head, and the girl quickly curled up and hid.
0:6:56|0:7:1|As the sky darkened, [Yuan Shuai] walked towards the house covered in vines, opened the iron gate, and walked in carrying a cake.
0:7:1|0:7:12|[Yuan Shuai] changed into work clothes, took a shovel and scooped up the feed from the ground and the pool into a cart, then pushed the cart filled with feed outside a iron fence where an elephant was kept, and poured the feed on the ground.
0:7:12|0:7:19|The elephant raised its trunk to signal to [Yuan Shuai], who also friendly chirped at the elephant and slowly walked away with the cart.
0:7:19|0:7:23|Just a few steps in, Yuan Shuai sensed something was amiss and turned his head back suspiciously.
0:7:23|0:7:30|He quickly rolled his eyes and then suddenly squatted down, looking into the half-pulled curtain door on the other side, but found nothing.
0:7:30|0:7:39|His phone suddenly rang, he took out the phone and wiped his fingers clean on his work clothes.
0:7:57|0:8:3|[Yuan Shuai] is tidying up in the shabby room, putting on a shirt and vest, and even tying a delicate bow tie.
0:8:3|0:8:9|At this moment, the father with snake phobia suddenly made a video call.
0:8:52|0:8:59|[Yuan Shuai] saw his father collapsing on the screen, being supported by a nurse. He furrowed his brows gradually, with a vacant expression, and slowly put down his phone.
0:8:59|0:9:4|After the phone call ended, the scene cuts to outside a coffee shop, with sunlight shining on the sign of the coffee shop.
0:9:5|0:9:10|[Yuan Shuai] arrived at the caf√© for a blind date as scheduled, enthusiastically taking photos of a Garfield cat.
0:9:10|0:9:20|In the shot, a pair of feet in slippers suddenly appeared, and a girl in a white dress stood outside the glass window, squatting down to look at a kitten. [Yuan Shuai]'s phone gradually moved up until he could see the girl's face clearly.
0:9:21|0:9:26|The girl glanced at him, and he absentmindedly recorded the girl's beauty on his phone.
0:9:26|0:9:40|The girl ran into the coffee shop, startling [Yuan Shuai] who was suddenly standing in front of her. She smiled at him while dipping her fingertips into the fish tank next to her, stirring the water clockwise.
0:9:48|0:9:52|Yuan Shuai was surprised to hear the girl knowing her own name.
0:9:52|0:9:58|[Yuan Shuai] glanced down at his phone, his blind date's last name was also Bai.
0:10:10|0:10:20|The girl picked up [Yuan Shuai]'s cup and drank it all in one gulp, then scooped up a cup of water from the fish tank, also caught a goldfish, drank it all in one breath, and then spit the goldfish back into the tank.
0:10:47|0:10:53|Hastily used a book to cover his face,
0:11:0|0:11:3|[Yuan Shuai] was completely not listening to what the girl was saying. A thug noticed him and patted his companion.
0:11:3|0:11:8|[Yuan Shuai] immediately got up and left, hiding in the bathroom. He tried to escape by climbing out the window, but couldn't open it.
0:11:8|0:11:14|In a moment of urgency, [Yuan Shuai] pushed open the door of one of the compartments. Just then, a group of thugs rushed in with meteor hammers.
0:11:28|0:11:36|The thug leader Zhi Gang in the compartment raised his hand, and [Yuan Shuai] had to hand over his resume.
0:12:1|0:12:5|A woman is secretly filming her. At that moment, [Yuan Shuai] is taken away.
0:12:11|0:12:15|[Yuan Shuai] The real blind date partner has arrived today, but he is wearing a neck brace and can only awkwardly greet her.
0:12:15|0:12:21|Bai Xianchu furrowed his brow in confusion.
0:12:48|0:13:3|A young man with silver hair, wearing a floral shirt, sat across from [Yuan Shuai], holding a knife in his hand. He stabbed the knife into a wooden board, then raised his hand and cut off his own pinky finger. He licked the severed finger and used the bloodied knife to make a cut on [Yuan Shuai]'s face.
0:13:11|0:13:28|Zhi Gang took out Yuan Shuai's wallet and counted the money inside. After speaking, he threw the wallet on the ground and gave him a contemptuous look. After they left, Yuan Shuai sat on the ground helplessly, lost in thought.
0:13:30|0:13:38|In the evening, [Yuan Shuai] returned to his run-down house. He sat on the sofa and took out his phone. As he lit up the screen, a pair of hands appeared.
0:13:38|0:13:43|Gently patting his shoulder, he was so scared that he turned around and sat on the floor.
0:13:44|0:13:50|Upon closer inspection, it turns out that Bai Xianchu emerged from behind the sofa from the box.
0:14:10|0:14:18|Xiao Bai pouted while talking and looked at [Yuan Shuai], but [Yuan Shuai] frowned and cursed, then rubbed his head and sat back on the sofa.
0:15:6|0:15:13|He recalled saving a white fox in his childhood.
0:15:49|0:16:0|Xiao Bai jumped up and down in place, then viciously pounced on [Yuan Shuai] again, repeated the action, but there was still no change.
0:16:5|0:16:26|[Yuan Shuai] pulled out a bottle of beer from under the seat and handed it to Bai Xianchu. Bai Xianchu took the beer, gulped it down, and Yuan Shuai was stunned to see that there was no change even after Bai Xianchu burped.
0:16:28|0:16:35|[Yuan Shuai] took out a bottle of liquor from the box again. After Bai Xianchu snatched the bottle, he threw the cap fiercely on the ground, ready to drink it all in one go.
0:16:36|0:16:47|In Yuan Shuai's surprise, Xiao Bai quickly finished the bottle of liquor and threw it on the ground.
0:17:3|0:17:8|[Yuan Shuai] tried to turn away to avoid it, but then sneakily looked back until he saw a change in Xiaobai's body, unable to speak in astonishment.
0:17:8|0:17:19|Bai Xianchu's eyes turned blood red, gradually growing white fur and a huge tail, bursting out of the clothes on his body, instantly transforming into a super large silver fox. [Yuan Shuai] was scared and sat paralyzed on the sofa, watching the silver fox.
0:17:19|0:17:20|Looking at him, [Yuan Shuai] licked his lips.
0:17:20|0:17:36|He was so scared that he ran with all his might, but the Silver Fox reached out its paw trying to grab him. In the process, it accidentally stripped off his clothes, leaving only a pair of flowery underpants on his legs, with two scratch marks. He got up and ran out of the house, slamming the big iron gate shut.
0:17:36|0:17:47|So back to the opening scene of the film, the silver-haired man and the man with glasses who were monitoring [Yuan Shuai] outside were a little surprised to see [Yuan Shuai] rushing out shirtless. Just then, Little Bai, who had transformed into a silver fox, crashed through the iron gate, and she
0:17:47|0:17:58|Drunk and leaning against the iron gate, [Yuan Shuai] staggered. The silver-haired man dragged the man with glasses who was screaming in fear and ran backwards. [Yuan Shuai] ran barefoot on the road in the zoo, with little Bai stumbling behind him.
0:17:58|0:18:6|Even the golden snub-nosed monkey was lying on the wire mesh watching Yuan Shuai. Little Bai, because of his huge size, jumped onto the wooden roof and fell down, hitting his head.
0:18:6|0:18:11|[Yuan Shuai] ran into the woods, but got his foot pierced by a branch, screaming in pain.
0:18:42|0:18:52|A man walks into a secret room and releases a bee-like small robot to the aunt before closing the door. The plaque in the magnificent secret room reads: Third Division of the Monster Management Bureau, Humans and Monsters Have Different Paths, Warning Bells Ringing.
0:18:52|0:19:0|He is the deputy director of the Monster Management Bureau, [Hong Sicong]. Several women descended from the sky and sat beside him, watching the big screen together.
0:19:5|0:19:14|On the screen, detailed information about Bai Xianchu is displayed. The scene then shifts to a street outside, where the injured Yuan Shuai grabs hold of an old lady pushing a tricycle.
0:19:31|0:19:42|Riding a tricycle selling watermelons, the man crashed into Xiaobai head-on. The watermelons and the tricycle were sent flying, with the watermelons falling from the sky and landing one by one at the feet of [Yuan Shuai]. He was scared and jumped around, while the tricycle happened to crash right in front of him, luckily leaving him unharmed.
0:19:42|0:19:46|[Yuan Shuai] clings to the railing and runs up a residential building.
0:19:48|0:20:0|He saw Bai Xianchu stumbling and wagging his tail as he walked in the narrow alley from upstairs. He casually opened a door that was not closed and hid inside. Bai Xianchu leaped onto the corridor, then used the corridor and the air conditioning unit of the building to jump onto the roof.
0:20:0|0:20:3|With a strong push from Bai Xianchu, the air conditioner outdoor unit fell to the ground.
0:20:3|0:20:16|In the narrow street, on the damp ground, several women in short skirts and high heels run towards the direction where the air conditioner is falling. In the middle is [Hong Sicong] from the Monster Management Bureau, he takes off his coat and gives it a strong shake towards the sky.
0:20:24|0:20:34|Several henchmen leaped over the small car in front of them, and [Hong Sicong], using a few of them as support, leaped onto the balcony filled with flowers.
0:20:34|0:20:43|On the other side, [Yuan Shuai] arrived at the rooftop, stealthily moving from the inside to the outside of the huge billboard. He was wearing embroidered shoes, carefully sticking to the billboard, moving very slowly.
0:20:43|0:20:56|At this moment, Xiao Bai also followed him to the rooftop. The position where [Yuan Shuai] was standing was only two body lengths away from the edge, a slight carelessness could lead to a fall. Suddenly, Xiao Bai launched an attack behind the billboard, revealing the face of international superstar Jia Bingbing on the poster.
0:20:56|0:21:12|Two large holes were torn in the upper part, [Yuan Shuai] had to slowly move to the other side of the billboard. He squatted down at the edge of the billboard and looked back, seeing nothing, he stood up and walked on the rooftop. At this moment, facing one side, Little Bai hiding in the gap of the billboard suddenly stuck out her tongue and licked his face in a circle.
0:21:12|0:21:21|[Yuan Shuai] was frightened and ran out again. He pushed aside layers of drying sheets and reached the edge of the roof. Luckily, he grabbed the birdcage next to him and didn't fall down.
0:21:21|0:21:31|When he turned back again, a sheet was already covering Little Bai's face, which had caught up to him. He held his head and slowly straightened his bent waist, carefully looking at the monster in front of him.
0:21:31|0:21:38|Bai Xianchu peeled off the sheet on his face, curled up his body, and his huge tail slapped on the ground as he looked at Yuan Shuai with big innocent eyes.
0:21:38|0:21:49|[Yuan Shuai] also became bolder, reaching out his hand to approach Little White, attempting to touch it. Little White closed its eyes, sniffed [Yuan Shuai]'s hand, then suddenly opened its mouth wide, startling [Yuan Shuai].
0:21:49|0:21:55|He dodged backwards, accidentally stepping on a bottle. As he lost his balance and leaned back, he grabbed onto a clothesline in a split second.
0:21:55|0:22:6|Who would have thought that the clothesline with a row of clothes, [Yuan Shuai], along with the birdcage, clothes hanger, and clothesline next to it, all fell down from the building. At this moment, [Hong Sicong] made a handsome appearance, using the clothesline rod between the buildings as a fulcrum, and leaped to rescue the falling objects.
0:22:6|0:22:15|Yuan Shuai is brought down, and a princess carry puts him flat on the ground.
0:22:16|0:22:22|[Hong Sicong] pressed the switch on his waist player, stood with his teammates, and they all made cute expressions, taking a group photo together.
0:22:22|0:22:26|The team members looked up and saw Bai Xianchu quickly running away on the roof.
0:22:29|0:22:38|The male secretary took out a briefcase, and after the female team member opened it, she took out a glass tube and threw it into the air, immediately producing many small insect-like machines.
0:22:38|0:22:42|The firefly quickly locked onto the human who had just witnessed the monster.
0:23:3|0:23:7|Bai Xianchu grabbed the flying insect heading towards Yuan Shuai with one hand.
0:23:20|0:23:28|Xiao Bai slapped [Hong Sicong] in the face, leaving his henchmen stunned beside him.
0:24:20|0:24:33|The subordinates applied ointment to the injured leg of [Yuan Shuai], and helped Xiao Bai onto the back of [Hong Sicong]. Just as [Hong Sicong] lifted Xiao Bai, he was immediately vomited on, leaving him stunned and motionless, while his subordinates looked on in shock.
0:24:38|0:24:42|After speaking, [Hong Sicong] flicked his bangs, and his men threw [Yuan Shuai] to the ground before walking away quickly.
0:24:43|0:24:50|[Yuan Shuai], wearing only his underwear, lay on the ground, feeling a ray of sunlight shining on his face. He slowly opened his eyes.
0:25:9|0:25:14|[Yuan Shuai] got up and ran, grabbing a skirt that someone had left outside, surprising the aunt reading the newspaper on the roadside.
0:25:14|0:25:22|[Yuan Shuai] is wearing a dress, walking in the alley with messy hair, covering her face with her hand. The old lady on the nearby stairs points and talks about her.
0:25:22|0:25:30|The streets of Shanghai are bustling with people coming and going, in a hurry, six hours later.
0:25:45|0:25:50|The man in the floral shirt with a knife walked up to [Yuan Shuai], while the chubby man set down a wooden table.
0:25:53|0:25:59|Hearing this, the stick in the glasses man's hand fell off in shock, and Zhi Gang awkwardly said,
0:26:16|0:26:23|[Yuan Shuai] sat on the floor, staring blankly at the ground.
0:26:27|0:26:42|The character in a floral shirt cut off his own little finger with a small knife, stood up, holding the finger and the knife in one hand, and licked the wound with blood in his mouth. He walked up to [Yuan Shuai], squatted down in front of him, and handed the severed little finger to him. [Yuan Shuai] then put the finger in his own mouth and licked it as well.
0:26:43|0:26:55|Several hooligans were stunned as [Yuan Shuai] suddenly looked up at the floral shirt. The floral shirt, at a loss, looked towards Brother Zhigang, and reached out a hand to reveal a prosthetic limb prop.
0:27:9|0:27:17|[Yuan Shuai] threw his fingers on the ground and rushed to Brother Zhigang. At this moment, Xiao Bai arrived and walked straight to [Yuan Shuai], asking fiercely,
0:27:42|0:27:48|Little Bai turned her head, and the fat guy was instantly thrown to the railing in the middle of the room, where he got stuck. [Yuan Shuai] was shocked and dropped his jaw on the spot.
0:28:14|0:28:21|[Yuan Shuai] stood in front of Bai Xianchu and roared, causing the thugs to step back one after another. They all stared behind [Yuan Shuai], their eyes widened in fear, and then they fled.
0:28:21|0:28:26|[Yuan Shuai] thought he had scared away the thugs by losing his temper, and smiled. But when he turned around, he saw...
0:28:27|0:28:34|[Yuan Shuai] quickly pushed open the large iron gate and fled outside, with Bai Xianchu's human body carrying a fox's head.
0:28:34|0:28:42|In the Monster Management Bureau, the big screen displays a Level Three alert: unauthorized shapeshifting by a Transformer, and there is also information about [Bai Xianchu] at the Unity Zoo.
0:28:42|0:28:46|[Hong Sicong] is surrounded by his subordinates, sitting on the sofa and watching the screen.
0:28:58|0:29:4|Male secretary asked [Hong Sicong], who handed the water glass to his subordinate next to him, stood up from the sofa and faced the male secretary.
0:29:11|0:29:22|The woman's henchman smirked behind him. Meanwhile, [Yuan Shuai] was running frantically in the alley, with a mosquito-like aircraft following behind. He lifted the sheet in front of him, only to have a hand cover his mouth and push him against the wall.
0:29:22|0:29:26|White, transformed into human form, slapped the mosquito onto the wall with one hand.
0:29:28|0:29:36|[Yuan Shuai] nodded as he watched her, and Bai Xianchu slowly removed the hand covering his mouth.
0:30:0|0:30:5|[Yuan Shuai] kept backing away, fell over a car frame, and flipped over it. Xiao Bai pinned him down, locking his neck.
0:30:55|0:31:3|He shifted his gaze to Bai Xianchu's chest, took a glance, but Bai Xianchu smiled sweetly at him. Suddenly, he pulled out a wooden stick from somewhere and said to Bai Xianchu,
0:31:8|0:31:22|Little Bai disappeared in a flash, [Yuan Shuai] took the opportunity to escape. Just as he turned around, Little Bai appeared in front of him with a stick in his mouth. Little Bai was still shaking his head and swaying, showing off, and looking at him, he handed the stick in his mouth to him.
0:31:22|0:31:27|[Yuan Shuai] caught the stick in surprise and embarrassment, giving a thumbs-up to Xiao Bai.
0:31:28|0:31:36|Xiao Bai smiled happily, [Yuan Shuai] threw the stick on the ground and picked up a stone.
0:31:40|0:31:45|After speaking, he used all his strength to throw the stone out, and Xiao Bai immediately flew out. [Yuan Shuai] took the opportunity to turn around and run.
0:31:45|0:31:51|On the other side, a few people in black suits suddenly barged in from the Monster Management Bureau, and [Hong Sicong]'s subordinates took a step back.
0:31:52|0:31:59|A man in a cloak stood in the center of the management bureau, with [Hong Sicong] sitting in a wheelchair, his feet bandaged, being pushed out by a woman subordinate.
0:32:39|0:32:44|Hong Sicong's male subordinate was knocked down by Yun Zhonghe's subordinate with a punch on the spot.
0:32:45|0:32:51|[Yun Zhonghe] looked serious as he watched the female subordinates next to him. Several beautiful female subordinates were frightened and frowned, stepping back.
0:32:51|0:33:1|He walked up behind [Hong Sicong], reached out his hands, and pressed them forcefully on [Hong Sicong]'s shoulders, causing [Hong Sicong]'s face to suddenly turn into a cat-like expression.
0:33:23|0:33:29|Director Yun pressed his index finger against [Hong Sicong]'s face.
0:33:52|0:34:6|And then a pair of huge vulture wings appeared, pulling the woman's subordinate into his arms. The woman's subordinate suddenly raised her head in pain, [Hong Sicong] stood up from the wheelchair and was swept away by [Yun Zhonghe]'s wings.
0:34:7|0:34:18|[Yun Zhonghe] released the woman's hand, and put away the syringe with a needle in his hand. The woman's limbs twisted instantly, walking unsteadily and leaning against the wall, knocking over a vase and a table.
0:34:18|0:34:25|Seeing this scene, Yuan Shuai's subordinates knelt on the ground, looking very scared. Her hands were covered in bloodshot veins, and she had scratched many marks on the carpet with her fingernails.
0:34:25|0:34:28|She grabbed her hair in pain, blood vessels gradually covering her body, and her eyes turned white.
0:34:30|0:34:43|In the moment she ran towards [Yun Zhonghe], one of [Yun Zhonghe]'s men pulled out a gun and shot the woman, turning her instantly into a small cat. The other henchmen of [Hong Sicong] were already kneeling on the ground trembling. [Yun Zhonghe] squatted down and stroked the little cat, saying,
0:34:56|0:35:4|[Yun Zhonghe] and [Hong Sicong] locked eyes, and the henchman who had just fired the gun took the kitten away.
0:35:5|0:35:8|[Yun Zhonghe] stood up and said to [Hong Sicong],
0:35:10|0:35:15|He put the vial-like small bottle in his hand into the open briefcase held by his subordinate, and then left with his subordinate.
0:35:15|0:35:24|On the other side, in a private kitchen, [Yuan Shuai] sat across from two women, one with long flowing hair and the other with stylish short hair. [Yuan Shuai] asked the woman with long hair,
0:36:47|0:36:59|Xiao Bai pursed her lips as [Yuan Shuai] pointed at her shoulder, pushing her aside and overturning the table next to them in front of the crowd. Glass cups, plates, and [Yuan Shuai]'s documents scattered all over the floor, with the restaurant customers looking at him and whispering to each other.
0:36:59|0:37:8|[Yuan Shuai] looked at the mess on the ground, while Little Bai suddenly disappeared. [Yuan Shuai] put on a suit jacket and walked alone in the dim alleyway.
0:37:8|0:37:12|The dim light in the alley made him look even more desolate.
0:37:14|0:37:20|[Yuan Shuai] stopped in his tracks as three men in black approached him, the leader wearing a black cloak.
0:39:20|0:39:26|[Yun Zhonghe] took out something like a syringe and gestured on his neck.
0:39:28|0:39:30|Yuan Shuai looked at the syringe in his hand and handed it to Yuan Shuai.
0:39:30|0:39:39|[Yun Zhonghe] smiled, and a henchman behind [Yuan Shuai] took out something and placed it behind him. When [Yuan Shuai] turned around, he saw two stacks of banknotes.
0:40:9|0:40:17|[Yuan Shuai] arrived at the amusement park and asked around at the restaurant. He sat on a bench and a girl carrying a huge plastic bag filled with plastic bottles approached him.
0:40:17|0:40:22|The girl viciously crushed the empty bottle under his feet, and [Yuan Shuai] looked up to see it was Little Bai.
0:40:48|0:40:55|[Yuan Shuai] walked away with red eyes, while Bai Xianchu walked to a nearby bench with scrap in hand, stepping on the seat and sitting on the backrest.
0:41:1|0:41:13|The screen displayed: "You have successfully paid 20,000 yuan, but still owe 80,000 yuan." He turned off his phone, and saw [Bai Xianchu] sitting beside him, absent-mindedly dragging his cheek. He slowly approached [Bai Xianchu], with one hand reaching into his pocket.
0:41:13|0:41:22|Took out the syringe given to him by [Yun Zhonghe]. The lively street and the two people full of concerns were out of place.
0:41:22|0:41:28|He slowly walked up behind [Bai Xianchu], glanced into the distance, and then put the syringe back into his pocket.
0:41:30|0:41:38|He raised his finger and pointed to a shining building in the distance, [Bai Xianchu] lifted his head and looked in the direction he was pointing.
0:41:50|0:41:59|[Yuan Shuai] turned his head and looked at [Bai Xianchu], sitting beside her.
0:42:26|0:42:33|[Bai Xianchu] squatted on the back of the chair, looking at [Yuan Shuai] and asked,
0:43:2|0:43:13|The fireworks above seemed to be blooming for the two of them. [Yuan Shuai] looked at [Bai Xianchu]'s clear and determined eyes following him, gradually stood up and revealed a content smile.
0:43:13|0:43:30|He turned around slowly, looking at the dazzling fireworks in the sky. He smiled from the bottom of his heart. But when he turned back, he found that [Bai Xianchu], who had been sitting on the bench, was gone.
0:43:30|0:43:35|[Yuan Shuai] nervously looked around, the amusement park crowded with people.
0:43:35|0:43:41|The scene shifts to a brightly lit nightclub, where [Bai Xianchu] arrives.
0:44:1|0:44:10|Two girls in short skirts uniforms walked in, with [Bai Xianchu] following behind. A man in sunglasses and a woman in glasses were sitting on the sofa in the middle.
0:44:21|0:44:24|[Bai Xianchu] rushed to President Chang's side the moment she saw the banknotes.
0:44:24|0:44:31|On the other side, [Yuan Shuai] also arrived at the nightclub. He saw a piece of clothing in the corridor and picked it up to examine it carefully.
0:44:45|0:44:51|In the private room, the woman with glasses walked to the side, casting a peculiar glance at [Bai Xianchu] who was singing, her eyes emitting a strange light, and she pushed her glasses with her hand.
0:44:51|0:44:55|Outside the private room, [Yuan Shuai] anxiously pushes open the door of a private room, where men and women are happily holding bottles of alcohol.
0:45:13|0:45:23|Outside the nightclub, an off-road vehicle stopped. A henchman opened the door for [Yun Zhonghe], who got out of the car and led his men into the nightclub. The female manager hurried over and said,
0:45:31|0:45:36|The female manager lifted the suit of her subordinate, revealing the gun at her waist. She waved her hand repeatedly, while [Yun Zhonghe] stared at her with a serious expression.
0:45:55|0:46:3|[Yuan Shuai] suddenly burst into the private room, everyone looked at him, and [Bai Xianchu] stood still upon seeing him. In the corridor of the nightclub, men and women were all lying on the ground, pretending.
0:46:3|0:46:11|As if the Buddha had died. The tray and the wine bottle were shattered on the ground, with some glowing mosquitoes flying around, [Yun Zhonghe] led his men into a private room.
0:46:36|0:46:42|[Yuan Shuai] took off his suit jacket while talking, and put it on [Bai Xianchu], revealing the shirt with one sleeve missing. He turned his back,
0:46:42|0:46:47|Taking out the syringe given by [Yun Zhonghe] from his pocket, he held it above his head to show Xiao Bai.
0:47:4|0:47:11|[Yuan Shuai] approached Xiao Bai while talking, Xiao Bai kept backing away, [Yuan Shuai] gestured with his hands to show how to poke her, but Xiao Bai suddenly moved forward.
0:47:27|0:47:40|Xiao Bai pointed at her own neck, looked into [Yuan Shuai]'s eyes and pressed him for an answer, but [Yuan Shuai] dared not meet her gaze.
0:47:43|0:47:50|After speaking, he turned around and took a few steps forward. Xiao Bai stood still and watched his back. He slowed down his pace and stole a glance at Xiao Bai with the corner of his eye.
0:47:50|0:47:59|Bai Xianchu slowly approached him, leaning her chin on his shoulder from behind, and holding his hand that was in the pocket with the syringe.
0:48:12|0:48:25|[Yuan Shuai] turned his head to look at Xiaobai's face, then lowered his head.
0:48:28|0:48:33|Xiao Bai stared fixedly at the profile of [Yuan Shuai], then slowly lifted her head.
0:48:36|0:48:40|Yuan Shuai exposed his snow-white neck to her and closed his eyes. He looked at Xiaobai's neck and then at her face.
0:48:40|0:48:52|Suddenly, a hand grabbed her neck and kissed her forcefully, scaring Xiaobai to open her eyes. [Yuan Shuai] held her tightly against his back, and Xiaobai was at a loss at first, until [Yuan Shuai] gently let her go.
0:48:52|0:48:56|She slowly took the initiative to kiss him and wrapped her arms around [Yuan Shuai]'s neck.
0:48:56|0:49:2|In the moonlight, the two temporarily forgot the differences between humans and demons, weaving the appearance of love.
0:49:2|0:49:9|The scene cuts to the run-down house where [Yuan Shuai] lives near the zoo.
0:49:12|0:49:19|[Bai Xianchu] suddenly appeared in front of [Yuan Shuai] with a kitchen knife, cut his own palm with the knife, and then forcibly cut [Yuan Shuai]'s palm before interlocking their fingers.
0:50:12|0:50:20|[Bai Xianchu] laughed and pushed [Yuan Shuai]'s chest with both hands, causing him to instantly fly backwards and fall onto the bed. Feathers floated in the air, and [Bai Xianchu] leaped into the air.
0:51:19|0:51:30|On the other side, Yun Zhonghe's subordinate reported to him the message they received, which read: "The demon has exceeded the contact limit, a group of glowing mosquitoes flew towards the woman with glasses."
0:51:50|0:51:58|[Yun Zhonghe] tore off the glasses of the woman, who was actually wearing a human skin mask of an orchid, and she instantly fell onto the sofa, revealing a pair of huge butterfly wings on her back.
0:52:27|0:52:39|On the other side, [Bai Xianchu] lay beside [Yuan Shuai] without falling asleep. When she heard the sound of the phone, she got up from the bed, took out [Yuan Shuai]'s phone from the pants on the floor, and saw a video call from her schizophrenic father on the screen.
0:53:14|0:53:29|She stabbed behind her at [Yun Zhonghe], but he, who was already on guard, grabbed her wrist with one hand and pressed her head with the other. [Yun Zhonghe] pulled her hair back and raised it, holding her hand to his neck, and blue blood gushed out instantly. The blue orchid quickly fell on the sofa.
0:53:29|0:53:41|[Yun Zhonghe] placed the dagger in Chang's hand, took out a handkerchief, wiped his hands, and finally covered the face of the butterfly orchid with the handkerchief. On the other side, [Yuan Shuai] was awakened and sat up from the bed, while [Bai Xianchu] changed into an old-fashioned outfit.
0:53:41|0:53:52|A man in uniform. A group of black-clad individuals with weapons arrive at the dilapidated house where [Bai Xianchu] and [Yuan Shuai] reside, and they open the door.
0:54:35|0:54:41|[Yun Zhonghe]'s black eyeballs suddenly turned orange-red, [Bai Xianchu] revealed sharp claws, and the black-clothed men around raised their guns.
0:54:41|0:54:51|All the people present were attracted by the singing, looking around and searching for the source of the sound. A figure in black leaped to the top of the pavilion and landed on all fours, [Yun Zhonghe].
0:54:51|0:54:59|Behind him, he raised his head and it was [Hong Sicong] from the Demon Control Bureau. With a player hanging from his waist, he approached [Yun Zhonghe] and turned off the button as he walked.
0:56:14|0:56:20|[Bai Xianchu] took the opportunity to pull [Yuan Shuai] away to escape, while [Hong Sicong] swiftly knocked down the weapons of Yun Zhonghe's men, preparing to chase after the two of them.
0:56:20|0:56:30|On the side, [Hong Sicong]'s men were all held back by [Yun Zhonghe]'s men. [Yun Zhonghe] aimed at [Hong Sicong] and fired, turning [Hong Sicong] into a small cat. [Bai Xianchu] pressed down on [Yuan Shuai]'s head, and a bullet passed through their heads.
0:56:30|0:56:41|The black-clothed person with an axe took the opportunity to attack them. [Bai Xianchu] pushed [Yuan Shuai] away and quickly dealt with a few rookie henchmen. Just as she held a weapon against the neck of a black-clothed person, [Yun Zhonghe] called out to her.
0:56:42|0:56:50|[Yun Zhonghe] holds a dagger against [Yuan Shuai]'s neck. [Bai Xianchu] puts down his weapon and walks towards [Yun Zhonghe], but the dagger in [Yun Zhonghe]'s hand gets even closer.
0:56:51|0:57:2|[Bai Xianchu] knelt on the ground, hands raised. A henchman approached from behind, pressing her head down and locking an electronic collar around her neck. [Yun Zhonghe] stared at her palms, furrowing his brow. If [Bai Xianchu] exerted any force, the collar would send an electric shock, causing her pain.
0:57:2|0:57:14|Reluctant to live. [Yun Zhonghe] was getting closer to examine the blade in [Bai Xianchu]'s palm when Zhi Gang and his three henchmen suddenly arrived. Everyone present turned their gaze towards Zhi Gang, and the man in glasses pushed aside the black-clothed person holding a weapon.
0:57:18|0:57:28|[Yun Zhonghe] looked at the four people in front of him in confusion, as the man with glasses snatched the gun from the person in black.
0:57:40|0:57:51|[Yun Zhonghe] slapped the face of the man in the floral shirt, [Bai Xianchu] took the opportunity to break free and ran out, but the man with glasses accidentally triggered the gun in his hand, hitting [Bai Xianchu].
0:57:51|0:57:52|[Bai Xianchu] was instantly revealed, transforming into a giant silver fox.
0:57:54|0:58:5|Several thugs were scared with wide eyes and open mouths. [Bai Xianchu] picked up [Yuan Shuai] and placed him on his back. The black-clothed person picked up a weapon and surrounded the huge monster in front of them, but no one dared to act rashly, and no one was willing to step forward.
0:58:5|0:58:6|Front interception.
0:58:6|0:58:10|They shot again with their guns, but were all evaded by this huge silver fox.
0:58:10|0:58:15|[Bai Xianchu] led [Yuan Shuai] forward, charging past numerous men in black and thugs.
0:58:15|0:58:29|They were frantically escaping on the rooftop, with the black-clothed men chasing closely behind. They were jumping around on the rooftop at high speed, occasionally shooting at them, shattering the building and scattering debris everywhere. [Yuan Shuai] could only stick close to [Bai Xianchu]'s back to avoid being hit.
0:58:30|0:58:36|[Bai Xianchu] leaped between the buildings, narrowly avoiding a huge gap between two buildings.
0:58:36|0:58:41|[Bai Xianchu] advances through the rain of bullets with determination, while [Yuan Shuai] looks back to check the position of the men in black.
0:58:42|0:58:54|The bullet passed by, [Bai Xianchu] agilely dodged obstacles and bullets, reaching the rooftop of a building by the street. He sprinted upwards and successfully landed on a higher rooftop. The men in black were blocked by the wide road, only able to raise their guns and shoot at the building across the street.
0:58:54|0:58:58|On the wall of the room, [Hong Sicong] watched helplessly as Xiao Bai and Yuan Shuai escaped.
0:58:58|0:59:6|They arrived at the rooftop of a high-rise building with a helipad. [Yuan Shuai] gently stroked the fur of the massive creature beneath him, unaware that danger was looming.
0:59:6|0:59:14|In the distance, [Yun Zhonghe] stood on the rooftop, aiming the electronic mothership at Xiaobai's body through the scope. A mothership loaded with a syringe was shot out.
0:59:14|0:59:24|At a very fast speed, Yuan Shuai flew towards Bai Xianchu. Bai Xianchu sensed something was wrong and cautiously ducked down. The mother ship seemed to be tracked, flying two circles in the sky before...
0:59:24|0:59:35|Flying towards Xiaobai at a very fast speed. Xiaobai, with [Yuan Shuai], rushed in panic, leaped into the air, luckily the arrow shot onto the rooftop.
0:59:35|0:59:40|[Yun Zhonghe] widened his different-colored pupils, sprouted huge vulture wings from behind, and soared into the sky.
0:59:41|0:59:46|The scene shifts to the Hengdian Ancient Costume Film and Television Shooting Base, where a large sign reads: "No entry for unauthorized personnel."
0:59:47|0:59:54|Xiao Bai, carrying [Yuan Shuai], appeared on the roof of a pavilion, then jumped from a side hall to the roof of the main hall, looking around in all directions.
0:59:54|0:59:57|[Yuan Shuai] lightly patted Xiao Bai and asked,
0:59:58|1:0:6|Little Bai, who was originally full of energy, suddenly lowered his head and licked his front hoof with narrowed eyes. At this moment, [Bai Xianchu]
1:0:6|1:0:14|A blue light suddenly appeared in the sky, and the flying poison arrow instantly pierced Bai Xianchu's back. Bai Xianchu jumped in pain, causing Yuan Shuai to be thrown back and lifted up.
1:0:14|1:0:23|Injured Bai Xianchu fled in all directions, and the two of them fell into the woods beside the palace. [Yun Zhonghe] flew over the palace to take a look.
1:0:30|1:0:37|[Yuan Shuai] took off his coat to cover her, took out his phone from his pocket and handed it to the weak Bai.
1:0:54|1:1:7|A camper stopped in front of the two, and [Jia Bingbing] in emperor's costume ran down from the vehicle.
1:1:31|1:1:50|[Jia Bingbing] applied ointment to the wound, and the once huge wound miraculously began to heal slowly. Meanwhile, [Yun Zhonghe]'s men were using flashlights to search for clues in the woods. [Yun Zhonghe] looked around, stopped in front of a flower, squatted down, touched the leaves, and felt some fresh blood.
1:1:50|1:1:54|He carefully examined the blood on his hands, his pupils emitting a strange light once again.
1:1:54|1:2:6|The scene shifts to Renai Spiritual Sanatorium, where a nurse is lying on the ground, surrounded by glowing mosquitoes flying around. At this moment, several men in black approach, with [Yuan Shuai]'s father standing with his back to the door.
1:2:6|1:2:12|Lying on the side on the bed, his eyes were rolling around, and several men in black walked straight to his sickbed.
1:2:12|1:2:18|The scene shifts to the inside of [Jia Bingbing]'s trailer.
1:2:35|1:2:43|[Jia Bingbing] lowered her head to think of a solution, while Xiao Bai pushed back her hair. [Jia Bingbing] took out a hair tie with a bull demon king design and threw it to [Yuan Shuai]. [Yuan Shuai] stared at her blankly.
1:2:44|1:2:48|The RV drove to the set, and the scene shifted to an indoor shooting location.
1:3:10|1:3:13|There are many extras in ancient costumes and dressed as monsters on the set.
1:3:13|1:3:20|[Yuan Shuai] held Bai Xianchu's hand and looked around, while [Yun Zhonghe] arrived at the set entrance with a strong presence.
1:4:3|1:4:15|Jia Bingbing had just stretched out her arm when she was interrupted by the director. She looked at the director, who got up from his seat with a megaphone in hand, looking helpless.
1:4:16|1:4:26|All eyes in the room followed the director's footsteps as he walked through a group of extras and approached a man in a golden robe with half a bun hairstyle, pulling his collar to the center of the set.
1:5:4|1:5:10|The director's voice caught the attention of [Yun Zhonghe], who stared at [Yuan Shuai] and [Bai Xianchu].
1:5:22|1:5:37|Jia Bingbing lowered her head to think of a solution. When she came to her senses, Jia Bingbing waved her arm, and Xiao Bai pulled [Yuan Shuai] to run wildly in the crowd.
1:6:40|1:6:47|[Yun Zhonghe] stared straight at Xiaobai in the crowd.
1:7:7|1:7:12|She glanced at Bai Xianchu, who furrowed his brow and reluctantly stepped down from the sedan chair.
1:7:30|1:7:44|The extras turned their heads and walked towards [Yun Zhonghe], facing him with dozens of henchmen with blue paint on their faces. Xiao Bai extended his claws and entered battle mode.
1:7:46|1:7:58|At a command, the human and demon forces clashed. Leading the charge, the extras wearing masks suddenly stopped in their tracks and seized [Yun Zhonghe] around the waist in the chaos. Xiao Bai engaged in battle with [Yuan Shuai] and the person holding a shield.
1:7:58|1:8:1|Yuan Shuai accidentally got pushed to the ground.
1:8:1|1:8:8|Xiao Bai, with anger in her eyes, bared her fangs and lunged at the neck of the person who pushed [Yuan Shuai] down.
1:8:8|1:8:16|[Yuan Shuai], in a state of shock, got up and grabbed a handful of sand from the ground, throwing it at the people. Xiao Bai quickly dealt with the obstacles around and pulled [Yuan Shuai] to run.
1:8:16|1:8:25|[Yun Zhonghe] saw the two trying to escape, spread his wings from his clothes, took off into the sky, trying to catch up. But in mid-air, he was grabbed by a leg and fell to the ground in the sand.
1:8:25|1:8:28|Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be [Zhi Gang].
1:8:38|1:8:44|[Yun Zhonghe] spread his wings, and Zhi Gang and his men were knocked down. On the other side, Bai Xianchu casually picked up a shield and threw it, hitting the black-clothed men chasing them.
1:8:46|1:8:52|Bai Xianchu pushes Yuan Shuai away, while Yuan Shuai struggles to run towards the door in the flying sand and dust.
1:9:6|1:9:16|Yun Zhonghe's two henchmen dragged Yuan Shuai's father's feet, causing Yuan Shuai to fall to his knees on the ground. Yun Zhonghe removed the old man's mask and stepped on his head.
1:9:28|1:9:37|[Yuan Shuai] shifted his gaze to the poison on the sand next to him. Meanwhile, Little Bai, who was busy killing everyone around while holding the neck of [Yun Zhonghe], noticed something behind him.
1:9:37|1:9:44|[Yuan Shuai] put down the body in her hands and walked towards [Yuan Shuai], revealing her terrifying fangs, glaring fiercely at [Yun Zhonghe].
1:9:45|1:9:49|Yun Zhonghe's two henchmen behind him were about to make a move, but they were stopped by Yun Zhonghe.
1:9:50|1:10:3|Xiao Bai looked at the elderly man with white hair writhing in pain on the ground, then glanced at the filial son [Yuan Shuai] kneeling beside him. Xiao Bai squatted down in front of him, slowly lifted [Yuan Shuai] with both hands and held the hand holding the poison.
1:10:12|1:10:20|Yuan Shuai stared in horror as the poison was injected into Bai Xianchu's neck during the struggle, unable to believe what he was seeing.
1:10:20|1:10:28|Bai Xianchu weakly said a sentence to Yuan Shuai as they locked eyes, a tear slowly sliding down from the corner of his eye.
1:10:31|1:10:36|Suddenly her body twisted, [Yuan Shuai] released the poison needle and retreated in fear.
1:10:36|1:10:46|[Yun Zhonghe] raised his head triumphantly and looked at the two people. Little Bai kept rolling on the ground, with one eyeball turning white.
1:10:46|1:10:54|[Yuan Shuai] knelt on the ground, holding his head in fear and regret. [Yuan's father] lay on the side, clutching the sand on the ground in agony.
1:10:54|1:11:1|Bai Xianchu gradually calmed down, but his neck was covered with deep red veins that extended all the way to his handsome face.
1:11:1|1:11:8|After who knows how long, only [Yuan Shuai] was left kneeling beside her, the extras dispersed and left from their side.
1:11:10|1:11:19|Three months later, [Yuan Shuai] lay alone on the bed, half-opening his eyes. He sat up blankly, then brushed his teeth blankly in front of the mirror.
1:11:45|1:11:53|Without waiting for the person on the phone to finish speaking, he hung up and went to the hospital.
1:12:41|1:12:46|As he was about to leave, he suddenly heard a familiar voice.
1:12:46|1:12:54|He turned around to find the source of the sound, coming from his dad's phone.
1:13:45|1:13:53|He took his dad's phone, watched the video call, and returned to the dilapidated house covered in vines in the zoo where they used to live.
1:13:53|1:14:1|The grass outside the door had turned golden, and the bird models and plants inside the house were entangled in spider webs.
1:14:1|1:14:15|He looked at everything familiar in the room, the mottled walls and various lifelike animal models, and slowly walked towards the lifelike fox placed in the corner of the wall. He took off the white clothes draped over it.
1:14:15|1:14:31|He opened the clothes, examined them carefully, then sat on the edge of the bed, gently stroking the garment in his hand. He lay on the messy bed, hugging the clothes tightly to his chest.
1:14:34|1:14:39|At this moment, the blanket behind him was suddenly lifted, revealing the head of a man.
1:14:40|1:14:46|With disheveled hair and smeared makeup, [Hong Sicong] sits up from the bed and grits his teeth, saying,
1:15:16|1:15:30|The two fought from the bed to the ground, with [Yuan Shuai] pulling a piece of cloth and covering his head, then picking up a wooden rack and hitting him on the head.
1:15:30|1:15:38|He stared at [Hong Sicong] in a daze, while [Hong Sicong] sat there crying uncontrollably. [Yuan Shuai], looking disheveled, also sat beside them. [Hong Sicong] took a leaf and stuffed it into his mouth.
1:15:50|1:15:59|[Hong Sicong] took out his phone from his pocket, turned on the screen, and threw it to [Yuan Shuai]. [Yuan Shuai] opened the news app for the demon world.
1:17:0|1:17:14|[Yuan Shuai] sat on the ground dejectedly, [Hong Sicong] slowly turned to look at [Yuan Shuai], and handed him the ointment made of leaves.
1:17:16|1:17:21|[Yuan Shuai] looked at the ointment, then looked at [Hong Sicong].
1:17:39|1:17:50|The two arrived at a small shop called A Bao Noodle House, where a fat man in a vest and hat stood up and walked to [Yuan Shuai]. The boss led them to the kitchen and closed the door behind them.
1:17:50|1:17:57|At the dish window. He kneaded the dough on the cutting board, then picked up a small porcelain bottle and poured the liquid from the bottle onto the dough.
1:18:14|1:18:20|The boss pasted the dough on [Yuan Shuai]'s face, pinched his face for a long time, shaping it into a pancake with two air holes left for his nostrils.
1:18:20|1:18:32|The dough on [Yuan Shuai]'s face began to glow and heat up, and he saw the boss's face distorted through the cracks in the dough. The boss then took out a wig and put it on his head. When he lifted the dough,
1:18:32|1:18:44|[Yuan Shuai]'s face has turned into that of [Yun Zhonghe]. The boss picked up a stainless steel basin and had [Yuan Shuai] take a look. The disguised [Yuan Shuai] as [Yun Zhonghe] and [Hong Sicong] walked into a dilapidated compartment, in front of which there was a huge freezer.
1:18:46|1:18:52|The boss threw each of them a flashy big cotton coat, and the two of them walked into the freezer holding the clothes.
1:19:0|1:19:9|As the freezer door closed, the two, along with the freezer, fell from the air and landed in a corridor. The freezer automatically tipped over, causing the two to fall inside in a disoriented manner.
1:19:10|1:19:22|The freezer grew four wheels, the engine spun rapidly, turning into a super fast launcher, accelerating forward in the tunnel. When it reached a sharp turn, the freezer crashed around in the tunnel.
1:19:23|1:19:32|The two were contorted in the refrigerator, even biting into an apple. The refrigerator arrived at Nanjing West Road.
1:19:40|1:19:45|They looked around, took off their heavy cotton coats, and walked towards a large iron gate.
1:19:46|1:19:53|[Yuan Shuai] pushed open a crack in the door, and both of them leaned in to observe secretly. He suddenly turned and ran, causing [Hong Sicong] to slip and fall to the ground in fright.
1:20:17|1:20:26|The two of them arrived at the top floor, slowly entered the lobby, observing the surroundings. A large poster of seven Calabash Brothers hung in the corridor.
1:20:45|1:20:50|The monsters playing poker took out weapons and shields and lined up, [Yuan Shuai] took a step back.
1:21:37|1:21:45|[Yuan Shuai] turned his head and glanced at [Hong Sicong]. With a single look from [Hong Sicong], he slapped the leader in the face. The female staff at the front desk and [Hong Sicong] were all startled.
1:21:47|1:21:53|[Yuan Shuai] blinked blankly and turned to look at [Hong Sicong].
1:21:55|1:22:2|Hong Sicong looked around and then glanced at the person in charge, asking,
1:22:37|1:23:0|The girl at the front desk extended a long and thick snake tail from above to take a card, and the manager swiped the card and led the two into the elevator. As the elevator doors opened, the manager led the way in front, while the two observed the interior of the prison. There were many bridges connecting the huge space here, with some eyeball-like things floating in the air.
1:23:18|1:23:23|After facial recognition, there was another door inside, and after opening it, it was all dark inside.
1:23:36|1:23:44|[Yuan Shuai] walked in alone, the door behind him closed, with a faint light inside. [Yuan Shuai] walked forward slowly.
1:23:58|1:24:8|He followed the huge iron chain at his feet and found a silver-haired woman sitting on the ground, holding her head, with her back to him.
1:24:10|1:24:26|He crouched down, and the woman turned her head to reveal white pupils. As he approached her, she hugged her knees and moved back. When a beam of light shone on her face, [Yuan Shuai] saw that Xiaobai's face was now covered with blood vessels, her eyeballs had no pupils, and sharp fangs were exposed.
1:24:26|1:24:32|He lunged towards [Yuan Shuai], knocking him to the ground, with both [Hong Sicong] and the leader outside the door hearing the commotion.
1:24:32|1:24:45|The supervisor nodded with a smile. At this moment, there was another commotion in the cell. The supervisor went to check, and [Hong Sicong] pulled out the electric baton from his waist and threw it on the ground.
1:25:5|1:25:22|The leader looked at him with a smile on his face, nodding and bowing. On the other side, [Yuan Shuai] approached Bai Xianchu, but Bai Xianchu looked at him with unfamiliarity. [Yuan Shuai] then tore off his own human skin mask.
1:25:35|1:25:42|[Yuan Shuai] reached out his hand to touch Xiaobai's face, but Xiaobai bit his wrist.
1:25:47|1:25:54|With a swift move of his paw, [Yuan Shuai] was sent flying by Little White Claws. His head slammed hard against the wall, and he reached up to touch his head.
1:25:54|1:26:0|Fingers stained with blood, with a few blood marks scratched on the face.
1:26:58|1:27:2|Xiao Bai kicked [Yuan Shuai] down with one foot, then grabbed the chain and roared at him.
1:27:3|1:27:11|[Yuan Shuai] knelt on the ground, clutching his abdomen in pain, raised his left hand and showed the palm to Bai Xianchu.
1:27:13|1:27:20|Bai Xianchu leaned in to look at the scar in Yuan Shuai's palm.
1:27:32|1:27:42|[Yuan Shuai] grabbed Bai Xianchu's hand and pressed it against his own face, frantically slapping it. Bai Xianchu, in agony, put his fingers into his mouth.
1:27:44|1:27:51|[Yuan Shuai] ignored Little Bai's terrifying appearance, hugged her and pulled her into his arms, then kissed her fiercely.
1:27:51|1:27:55|The door of the prison cell suddenly opened, and [Hong Sicong] walked in.
1:28:8|1:28:20|[Hong Sicong] throws the mask on the ground to [Yuan Shuai], who puts on the human skin mask of [Yun Zhonghe]. [Hong Sicong] leads Little Bai, who is bound and wearing a mask, out of the elevator under the guidance of the leader.
1:28:21|1:28:26|Walking into the hall, the group coincidentally ran into the real [Yun Zhonghe], dressed in a cloak, accompanied by a female journalist and dozens of henchmen wearing eagle masks.
1:28:28|1:28:39|The real and fake [Yun Zhonghe] meet face to face, [Yuan Shuai] raises his head, the leader and the reporter are dumbfounded, the real [Yun Zhonghe] carefully sizes up the person in front of him who looks exactly like himself.
1:28:39|1:28:44|Little [Bai Xianchu] suddenly became restless, and [Hong Sicong] comfortingly patted her shoulder.
1:28:44|1:28:51|The leader pulled out a weapon, and the Eagle Beak team also took out their weapons. Infrared light was aimed at [Yuan Shuai], who pointed at [Yun Zhonghe] and said,
1:29:14|1:29:21|The leader approached [Yuan Shuai] and was slapped in the face by him.
1:29:42|1:29:47|[Yun Zhonghe] unfastened the cloak around his neck, revealing his enormous wings.
1:30:6|1:30:15|[Yun Zhonghe] stared at [Yuan Shuai], folded his wings. A female journalist on the side was live streaming the scene with her phone, [Yuan Shuai] glared at the person in charge and walked towards him, forcing the person in charge to step back.
1:30:40|1:30:46|The female journalist on the side was live streaming the scene with her phone, as the clasp on [Bai Xianchu]'s back gradually came undone.
1:30:53|1:31:3|Struggling free, [Bai Xianchu] slapped [Yuan Shuai] in the face, causing his human skin mask to fall to the ground. With a smirk on his lips, [Yun Zhonghe] watched as two monster security guards dragged away [Bai Xianchu].
1:31:7|1:31:11|The monsters were discussing animatedly, while [Yuan Shuai] stood in place, awkwardly looking around.
1:31:23|1:31:27|Hong Sicong's face is covered with fur, his eyes turn into shadows of a cat, revealing fangs and sharp claws.
1:31:27|1:31:34|He was just about to approach [Yun Zhonghe] to scratch him, but was grabbed by the neck by [Yun Zhonghe], punched and sent flying into the wall, smashing the tiles to pieces.
1:32:18|1:32:22|Saying that, [Yun Zhonghe] took out a sharp knife and pressed it against [Yuan Shuai]'s neck. At this moment, a large hole was suddenly dug out on the ground.
1:32:22|1:32:29|Everyone was staring at the floor, from which a dirty figure emerged, throwing out a metal plate covered in dirt.
1:32:29|1:32:36|At this moment, [Yun Zhonghe] takes the knife away from [Yuan Shuai]'s neck and looks at the person climbing out of the pit, who turns out to be the small-time hoodlum with glasses.
1:32:36|1:32:45|Behind him crawled out two other hooligans and the gang leader Zhi Gang, all four of them wearing tattered prison uniforms huddled together.
1:32:45|1:32:52|Their faces and bodies were covered in dirt, and everyone was watching them like they were monkeys. The Demon Realm News Eye also broadcasted this incident live.
1:34:12|1:34:18|The man in glasses took the opportunity to climb to the switch of the prison, and the person in charge shouted anxiously,
1:34:42|1:34:55|The prison doors all opened, and the monsters inside walked out like zombies. Hong Sicong's henchmen and the noodle shop owner were watching the live broadcast, Yun Zhonghe gritted his teeth in anger, and the journalist was stunned holding a phone.
1:34:55|1:35:3|In the building of Lianjia Real Estate, several bird beasts flew out through the glass, and many monsters escaped from the prison to the hall, leaving the monster security guards completely helpless.
1:35:3|1:35:10|[Yuan Shuai] knelt on the ground, looking at everything in astonishment.
1:35:11|1:35:21|Yun Zhonghe's subordinates surrounded him. A monster who managed to escape even stepped on the player dropped by Hong Sicong on the ground, causing all the monsters to swarm in. Yuan Shuai took the opportunity to sneak attack the security guards beside him.
1:35:21|1:35:27|Taking advantage of the chaos, Yuan Shuai shielded Xiao Bai underneath him. The journalist opened his mouth in fear, and many monsters were shot.
1:35:28|1:35:43|Blue and green blood gushed from the thigh, the person in charge climbing up the curtain was kicked hard on the head by a monster, a journalist broadcasting live was carried on the shoulder by a monster, while [Yuan Shuai] and Bai Xianchu hid in the corner.
1:35:46|1:35:53|Xiao Bai covered her face and looked carefully at [Yuan Shuai]. When [Yuan Shuai] tried to reach out and touch her face, Xiao Bai dodged backwards.
1:35:56|1:36:10|At this moment, [Yun Zhonghe] spread his wings, flew in the center of the hall, holding a crossbow, and ruthlessly shot down the monsters. This scene was secretly captured by the journalists hiding in the underground passage.
1:36:22|1:36:24|The monsters watching the live broadcast were all very terrified.
1:36:25|1:36:34|[Hong Sicong] got up from the ground and followed him on all fours, gesturing towards [Yuan Shuai] on the other side with a "you guys go ahead, I'll take care of him" gesture. [Yuan Shuai] understood the meaning as "got it, you want me to go up".
1:36:45|1:36:52|[Yun Zhonghe] kept shooting at him in anger, but he blocked the arrows with a shield. [Hong Sicong] gestured to him again, "Didn't I tell you to leave?"
1:37:0|1:37:9|At this moment, [Hong Sicong] seized the opportunity to jump up, grabbed [Yun Zhonghe]'s thigh, pulled him down, and instantly [Yun Zhonghe] was beaten up by a group of monsters on the ground.
1:37:12|1:37:22|[Yuan Shuai] was knocked down by the monster rushing towards [Yun Zhonghe], and in the next moment, Little Bai was also knocked down by a monster that seemed to come out of nowhere. Various monsters swarmed in to attack, with [Hong Sicong] under the army of monsters.
1:37:22|1:37:30|Firmly holding onto [Yun Zhonghe], the demons went crazy pulling out his feathers, causing feathers to float in the air everywhere.
1:37:31|1:37:35|At night, many birds and beasts are flying around the building.
1:38:1|1:38:16|Injured [Yun Zhonghe] picked up the dagger from the ground and walked towards Xiaobai. Just as he was about to stab Xiaobai, [Yuan Shuai] rushed over and grabbed his wrist, but the tip of the knife slowly pierced [Yuan Shuai]'s heart. Xiaobai witnessed this scene with countless memories flooding into her mind.
1:39:20|1:39:28|[Yuan Shuai] looked back at Xiaobai while Xiaobai got up and hugged [Yuan Shuai]. Her white pupils returned to normal. She caressed [Yuan Shuai]'s face.
1:39:28|1:39:35|The pupils suddenly turned blood red, glaring angrily at [Yun Zhonghe]. She grabbed [Yun Zhonghe] by the neck and threw him out through the glass roof.
1:39:35|1:39:44|[Yun Zhonghe]'s wings, broken and unable to fly, let out a scream as colorful feathers scattered in the air. [Yuan Shuai] still had a dagger stuck in his chest.
1:39:44|1:39:50|Normal Bai, with a frown, kneels in front of [Yuan Shuai], holding onto [Yuan Shuai]'s face.
1:41:53|1:42:3|The subway's display screen is showing this major news from the demon realm. In the subway usually taken by humans, humans and demons are now sitting side by side peacefully.
1:42:5|1:42:19|Yuan Shuai and Bai Xianchu were on the subway looking at the marriage certificate they had just received, with three gift boxes placed beside them. Yuan Shuai suddenly tightly grasped one of the boxes.
1:42:32|1:42:44|Bai Xianchu leaned on Yuan Shuai's shoulder while talking, and a few scorpions crawled out of the bag beside them. Yuan Shuai squatted on the ground and caught the scorpions bare-handed.
