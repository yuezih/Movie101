0:0:53|0:1:4|Chubby [Sun Yue] is wearing a Fuwa headgear.
0:1:4|0:1:7|[Sun Yue] is lying on the sofa covered with a blanket.
0:1:7|0:1:13|She impatiently took off her helmet and glanced up and down.
0:1:13|0:1:17|[Guo Degang] stood at the corner of the stairs, peeking out with a book in his arms.
0:1:17|0:1:22|The characters, with their completely different personalities as described, have formed a new team.
0:1:22|0:1:24|The life of the comedians in "Happy Comedy Club" begins.
0:1:40|0:1:43|On the stage, [Tai Wei] slowly turns around.
0:1:52|0:1:59|Zhang Xiaofei sat on the sofa and casually pressed the button on the remote control.
0:3:1|0:3:8|After switching channels, [Zhang Xiaofei] and [Ai Lun] stood on both sides wearing magician costumes, while [Sun Yue] was trapped inside a cardboard box in the middle.
0:3:58|0:4:1|And borrowed some performance techniques from Southeast Asia.
0:7:3|0:7:7|The plane slowly descends, its wheels gliding slowly on the tarmac.
0:7:7|0:7:13|The team has just arrived in Macau and started their four-day-three-night trip.
0:7:13|0:7:16|The team just walked out of the airport in a cool and handsome manner, coordinated with the music.
0:7:16|0:7:22|The camera pans across, each of them walking confidently, all wearing sunglasses and pushing suitcases, each with their own style.
0:7:24|0:7:29|At this moment, two beauties walked towards them, both unable to help but glance at the beauties.
0:7:29|0:7:35|[Zhang Xiaofei] refused to admit defeat and competed with the beauties, while [Ai Lun] reluctantly followed the beauties as they left.
0:7:35|0:7:37|[Zhang Xiaofei] saw the situation and quickly pulled [Ai Lun] back.
0:7:39|0:7:47|The luxury sedan parked at the entrance of the chicken farm had been waiting for a long time. The driver, seeing them approaching, stepped forward to greet them and took their luggage.
0:7:47|0:7:51|Ai Lun's team just got on the car, and the car smoothly shuttled through the streets of Macau.
0:7:51|0:7:52|Approaching the luxurious hotel.
0:7:52|0:8:5|The team members in the car are enjoying luxury cars and fine wine, raising their glasses together in celebration.
0:9:10|0:9:12|At this moment, someone in the co-pilot seat is holding a camera.
0:9:39|0:9:42|The team members looked at the camera, each paying attention to their personal image. 
0:9:42|0:9:50|They put down their raised legs, pretended to be very harmonious as they clinked glasses to celebrate, and the sedan drove into the hotel, shuttling on the winding road.
0:9:50|0:9:53|The exterior of the hotel is both luxurious and imposing, standing proudly in the center of Macau.
0:10:24|0:10:28|At this moment, a hand is holding a phone and secretly taking photos.
0:10:28|0:10:32|The person who was squatting stood up, and it turned out to be the comedy master Mr. [Guo Degang].
0:10:32|0:10:36|He looked around with his phone held up, then suddenly turned to the just-formed crowd.
0:10:41|0:10:51|Fans noticed that Mr. [Guo Degang] excitedly turned and ran out.
0:10:51|0:11:2|The team members who just lined up were no exception. They all excitedly ran to take a photo with Mr. [Guo Degang], except for [Yue Yunpeng], who smiled and walked to the side of the master while dragging his luggage.
0:11:28|0:11:41|Guo Degang left the reporters he had filmed and turned to leave. The bustling streets of Macau were filled with people. In a magic shop, [Ai Lun] clumsily performed magic, pretending to mysteriously stuff a dove into his clothes and then pull it out again.
0:11:41|0:11:44|The clumsy magic trick seemed not very clever, and the boss gestured to [Ai Lun].
0:11:52|0:11:57|A handsome man is stretching his arms, showing off his physique.
0:11:57|0:12:5|[Zhang Xiaofei] took a glance back and unexpectedly saw a handsome guy showing off his muscles. He then lowered his sunglasses, hoping to see more clearly.
0:12:5|0:12:8|While [Yue Yunpeng] was eating the samples in the food section.
0:12:16|0:12:21|[Yue Yunpeng] looked at the salesperson with a face full of illusions, then took out a shopping list from his pocket.
0:12:21|0:12:26|He showed off a list of items that couldn't be found on camera to the clerk, who stared at him intently.
0:12:26|0:12:35|Mr. Bean, who arrived in Macau, was curious about everything. He picked up his phone and started snapping pictures, following the camera to the famous casino in Macau.
0:12:35|0:12:39|[Tai Wei] is showing off his skills, all of which are being secretly filmed by reporters.
0:12:52|0:12:59|On the other side, the shop owner did not teach Ai Lun how to do magic tricks, but instead tricked him into buying many expensive magic props.
0:12:59|0:13:6|In the hotel, [Guo Degang] suddenly noticed someone taking photos behind him. He stopped and cooperated, but Mr. Hando pushed him away.
0:13:6|0:13:16|In fact, he was shooting the exhibit behind [Guo Degang], who awkwardly covered his face with a hat.
0:13:31|0:13:38|The handsome man felt for his party stick and got up to leave, [Zhang Xiaofei] awkwardly pursed her lips, while [Guo Degang] was busy shopping like crazy.
0:13:38|0:13:48|In the casino, Zhang Taowei also lost all his chips. Inside the hotel, [Sun Yue] the journalist held up a camera to film Pan Binglou. They stared into each other's eyes, refusing to admit defeat.
0:13:48|0:13:51|At this moment, journalist [Sun Yue] took the initiative to break the meaningless confrontation.
0:14:1|0:14:3|[Sun Yue] the journalist quickly moved his neck.
0:14:12|0:14:20|[Pan Binlong] also took off his guard and slowly stood up, but due to not moving for too long, he directly knelt on both knees. So he simply crawled forward.
0:14:36|0:14:48|In the room, [Guo Degang] tears off a face mask and sticks it on the mirror, then writes on the mirror with his hand.
0:14:48|0:14:59|In the bar, two beautiful women are sitting on a sofa. The long-haired woman is waving at someone on her phone, while the short-haired woman next to her is looking around with a photo of [Guo Degang] in her hand.
0:16:54|0:17:2|At this moment, Mr. Bean nonchalantly walked in as the elevator doors opened.
0:17:2|0:17:5|[Guo Degang] signaled for help to Ai Lun, but Ai Lun gave him a thumbs up instead.
0:17:13|0:17:23|The beauties were very excited to see Mr. Bean. The long-haired beauty took out her phone and walked to Mr. Bean's side.
0:17:23|0:17:27|Soon after, a short-haired beauty took charge and grabbed [Guo Degang] firmly in place with both hands.
0:17:27|0:17:35|The long-haired beauty gets Mr. Bean's consent and they take a selfie together.
0:17:35|0:17:40|The beauties changed positions, the short-haired beauty stepped forward to take a photo with Mr. Bean, while the long-haired beauty held onto [Guo Degang].
0:17:56|0:18:5|At this moment, [Guo Degang] appeared to be taking a group photo with the three, but secretly pressed the elevator floor button. When the elevator doors opened, he threw away his phone and turned to run.
0:18:5|0:18:11|Guo Degang, who escaped from the elevator, breathed a sigh of relief. But as he turned around, he bumped into the journalist Sha Wukong back to back.
0:18:25|0:18:32|Sandy the journalist, with his professional instincts, noticed something was amiss and immediately turned on his video camera to secretly record it.
0:18:32|0:18:37|He changed various positions to record the video, leaning boredly on the sofa and dozing off.
0:18:37|0:18:43|Suddenly, a group of people walked up the stairs aggressively, with the man in white leading the way followed by many bodyguards.
0:18:44|0:18:51|Mr. Bean walked in front of them, but accidentally spilled the jelly beans all over the floor.
0:18:51|0:18:58|A group of people behind were blocked by Mr. Bean, [Ai Lun] was impatient and decided to take a detour.
0:18:58|0:19:3|But Mr. Bean seemed to be able to anticipate the man's actions, always managing to block him in advance.
0:19:3|0:19:8|[Ai Lun] casually gestured to the bodyguards, who obediently escorted Mr. Bean away.
0:19:8|0:19:17|And behind the man, followed by the two beautiful women who had just kidnapped [Guo Degang], the cornered journalist Sand Monk recorded everything with his camera.
0:19:44|0:19:49|At night, the hotel lights were bright, but under this beautiful light, there was a hint of danger.
0:20:26|0:20:27|[Guo Degang] is already so old,
0:21:45|0:21:49|After they left, [Zhang Xiaofei] immediately pressed the voice key on her phone and said:
0:22:18|0:22:40|[Yue Yunpeng] and [Pan Binlong] came to the massage parlor looking for [Guo Degang]. When [Yue Yunpeng] touched the massage bed, on the other side, [Zhang Xiaofei] went to the bathroom and stuffed all of [Guo Degang]'s face masks into her pocket. Then she picked up the expensive skincare products on the table and examined them carefully.
0:22:40|0:22:44|He then squeezed some onto his face, looking satisfied at his reflection in the mirror.
0:23:40|0:23:42|Pan [Pan Binlong] unleashed his imagination.
0:24:16|0:24:21|The beauty Mei Zhangwen fell to the ground, and another beauty was awakened and got up to check.
0:24:57|0:25:5|The male police officers went to check on the fainting beauty, while the female police officer drew her baton and knocked [Guo Degang] down on the chair with a blow, returning to reality under the female officer's reprimand.
0:26:19|0:26:28|[Ai Lun] got up excitedly and walked towards the bathroom, leaving the team members pondering why [Guo Degang] had disappeared. Little did they know that [Ai Lun] was actually taking a shower in the bathroom.
0:26:29|0:26:37|The water heater floats up, and then he notices the gradually appearing characters on the mirror, and then gets up to take a closer look.
0:26:42|0:26:45|He quickly called his teammates over for help.
0:26:58|0:26:59|[Zhang Xiaofei] realized that her reaction was inappropriate.
0:28:18|0:28:24|The team members gathered around, looking at the keys they had just found in silence.
0:28:24|0:28:26|Suddenly, [Ai Lun] slammed the table and said.
0:29:53|0:29:58|Seeing them getting up to leave, [Ai Lun] planned to follow, but [Zhang Xiaofei] pushed him back onto the sofa.
0:29:58|0:30:7|The flashing lights in the bar, the beautiful women singing on stage, and the strong sense of rhythm make everyone involuntarily move their bodies to the music.
0:30:7|0:30:13|Meanwhile, [Yue Yunpeng], [Pan Binlong], and [Zhang Taiwei] also arrived at the bar, feeling the joyful atmosphere inside.
0:31:24|0:31:27|[Pan Binlong] shook the money in his hand as the waiter looked around.
0:31:43|0:31:49|After receiving the clue from the waiter, [Ai Lun], [Zhang Xiaofei], [Pan Binlong], [Tai Wei], [Sun Yue], and [Guo Degang] swayed their bodies to the music and walked towards the dressing room.
0:32:45|0:32:55|[Guo Degang] and [Tai Wei], who were stopped by the security guard, were startled. [Tai Wei] turned around and knelt on the ground in fear. [Guo Degang] adjusted his mood, turned around and smiled, saying,
0:33:23|0:33:30|Later, the two of them split up, and while the chaos ensued, [Pan Binlong] sneaked into the dressing room to search for the corresponding locker for the key.
0:33:30|0:33:34|Just then, a voice suddenly sounded, causing him to quickly hide.
0:33:34|0:33:38|He slowly moved back against the wall, peeking out to see what was going on.
0:33:54|0:34:2|On the other side, [Yue Yunpeng], who was getting ready to use the restroom, kicked the toilet seat cover off and let out a sigh.
0:34:2|0:34:4|On stage, the performance by the beautiful female group comes to an end.
0:34:37|0:34:41|Zhang Xiaofei and the beauties followed the man to greet the boss.
0:35:25|0:35:30|Hu Zinan looked at [Tai Wei] with a serious expression. In the bar, the lights kept changing and flashing.
0:36:34|0:36:44|[Tai Wei] was having a great time at the bar. Meanwhile, [Pan Binlong] finally waited until everyone in the dressing room had left. He cautiously peeked out and looked around.
0:36:44|0:36:51|[Pan Binlong] made sure the surroundings were safe. He then checked the numbers on the keys and successfully found the corresponding locker.
0:36:51|0:36:58|He opened the cabinet and found a plan book, on which it was written prominently, "I said [Guo Degang]'s plan book."
0:37:3|0:37:13|[Pan Binlong] opened the plan book and saw the contents inside, he quickly took out his phone.
0:37:13|0:37:24|[Pan Binlong] carefully took photos of each page of the plan with his phone. On the last page, he found a suspicious receipt that read "Macau Chef School."
0:37:24|0:37:30|[Ai Lun], who was in the bathroom, took out his phone and wiped it. He then opened the photo sent by [Pan Binlong] and carefully looked at it.
0:37:42|0:37:46|Suddenly, [Pan Binlong] found himself surrounded by the people who had just left the dressing room.
0:38:52|0:38:55|[Yue Yunpeng] who dared to come also escaped death and was chased and beaten together.
0:39:39|0:40:1|[Yue Yunpeng] opens the fireworks machine, and the fireworks instantly spray out, scattering in the bar. The three of them quickly take advantage of the chaos to escape.
0:40:1|0:40:4|Pan Binlong, who escaped alone, picked up a bottle of mineral water from a roadside stall.
0:40:8|0:40:28|He ran while swinging the bottle of mineral water in his hand, [Yue Yunpeng] and [Zhang Xiaofei] hiding behind the stage took the opportunity to slip out and walk towards the middle of the dance floor.
0:40:28|0:40:36|They found Haige lying on the ground, and [Zhang Xiaofei] reached out to feel Haige's breath.
0:40:47|0:40:50|[Yue Yunpeng] kneels beside Haige, checking on his condition.
0:40:50|0:40:54|[Yue Yunpeng] grasped with both hands, took a deep breath, and bent down.
0:40:54|0:40:58|He did not kiss Haige with his mouth, just exhaled a breath.
0:41:34|0:41:38|They helped Haige up from the ground, and Haige put his hand on [Guo Degang]'s shoulder.
0:41:38|0:41:39|The next day, the weather in Macau was fine. In the restaurant, the team members were pondering over the receipt photo sent by [Pan Binlong] yesterday, which showed an amount of 56,000.
0:43:6|0:43:10|He has also come to Macau.
0:44:2|0:44:15|Pan Binlong was afraid that Tai Wei hadn't eaten enough, so he took another plate from the table.
0:44:15|0:44:16|The scene changes.
0:44:19|0:44:21|They heard a noise and began to disguise their identities.
0:44:30|0:44:33|[Zhang Xiaofei] and [Guo Degang] listened uneasily to the chef's words.
0:45:15|0:45:19|[Yue Yunpeng] pushed open the door and picked up a shovel from the table, pressing it against the chef's neck.
0:45:49|0:45:57|The chef, under the coercion of [Yue Yunpeng], moved to the side in fear, lifted the black cloth covering the cage, revealing two small piglets inside.
0:45:57|0:45:59|[Yue Yunpeng] froze in place for a moment.
0:46:39|0:46:44|The brothers threw vegetable leaves at [Zhang Xiaofei], who held back her anger and brushed off the leaves with her hand.
0:47:6|0:47:24|[Yue Yunpeng] had just finished speaking when he was also hit with vegetable leaves.
0:47:24|0:47:29|[Zhang Xiaofei] and [Guo Degang] were once again left with the vegetable leaves, and [Zhang Xiaofei]'s anger reached its peak.
0:47:39|0:47:45|[Zhang Xiaofei] fought with [Guo Degang] and the chefs, vegetable leaves flying in the kitchen. Just then, [Pan Binlong] arrived at the door.
0:47:45|0:47:51|[Zhang Xiaofei] performs a sweeping kick, knocking down a chef. Suddenly, a wok is thrown at her.
0:47:51|0:47:53|[Zhang Xiaofei] borrowed force to push back the blame directly.
0:47:57|0:48:10|On the other side, [Yue Yunpeng] was sprinkled with pepper. As he and the chef both coughed uncontrollably, the range hood sucked in all the dust, leaving them astonished. They looked at the range hood in surprise. Hearing the commotion, [Pan Binlong] quickly left.
0:48:10|0:48:20|A group of people dressed in suits, wearing masks with [Guo Degang]'s face printed on them, blocked [Pan Binlong]'s way. Walking out from the middle was the short-haired beauty.
0:48:20|0:48:23|In the kitchen, [Guo Degang] is constantly dodging the thrown vegetable leaves.
0:48:30|0:48:34|[Pan Binlong] was forced into a corner, and a short-haired beauty pushed him, then turned around and said.
0:48:34|0:48:39|The Masked Man is preparing to put a bag over [Pan Binlong].
0:48:39|0:48:41|[Pan Binlong] quickly stuffed himself into the bag.
0:48:48|0:48:56|Pan Binlong was still taken away, but his phone dropped on the ground. Meanwhile, Yue Yunpeng was still in the kitchen, engaging in a battle of wits.
0:48:56|0:49:3|He was cunning, and accidentally landed on the pig-killing table. His feet and hands were firmly locked by the iron clasps extended by the machine.
0:49:18|0:49:22|At this moment, the door is opened and a burly man walks out.
0:49:22|0:49:25|[Zhang Xiaofei] also noticed the arrival of the head chef.
0:49:25|0:49:28|The head chef slowly walked up to [Zhang Xiaofei] and said contemptuously.
0:49:34|0:49:38|[Zhang Xiaofei] replied without hesitation.
0:49:40|0:49:43|Speak up, with hands clasped together, ready to test the head chef's true skills.
0:49:45|0:49:50|Suddenly, the head chef's clothes were torn apart, revealing a golden belt tied around his waist.
0:49:50|0:49:58|[Zhang Xiaofei] kicked a table over, and the head chef also extended his fist to push another table, forming a rectangle with the tables pushed together.
0:49:58|0:50:8|At this moment, the two seemed to be in a boxing ring. [Zhang Xiaofei] took the initiative to attack first, but both his punches and kicks were blocked by the head chef, who then seized the opportunity to strike back.
0:50:9|0:50:12|The fist stopped just 10 centimeters in front of [Zhang Xiaofei]'s face.
0:50:12|0:50:29|Zhang Xiaofei, unwilling to show weakness, kicked the carrots on the ground with her foot, but was punched by the head chef and accidentally activated the machine.
0:50:29|0:50:31|Other chefs hurried over to help.
0:50:34|0:50:47|The sharp knife kept moving upward, [Yue Yunpeng] was in great danger, the chef alliance who bit the ear signaled to [Zhang Xiaofei] not to touch him.
0:50:47|0:50:53|The head chef pushed [Zhang Xiaofei] away and punched the machine, causing it to malfunction and finally stop.
0:50:57|0:51:6|Everyone cheered as the machine stopped, [Zhang Xiaofei] and the head chef also let go of their grudges and embraced each other, while the still-shaken [Guo Degang] slumped on the stage.
0:51:6|0:51:10|The door slowly opens, and [Zhang Xiaofei] and [Guo Degang] come out from inside.
0:51:46|0:51:58|[Zhang Xiaofei] and [Guo Degang] found the phone that had just fallen to the ground from [Pan Binlong].
0:51:58|0:52:1|The two realized something was wrong, and at this moment [Sun Yue] arrived in Macau.
0:52:43|0:52:53|Suddenly, a business van stopped by the side of the road, and the people who got off the car were also in suits, wearing masks with the image of [Guo Degang], with a long-haired beauty in the middle.
0:52:53|0:52:57|The beauty gestured for them to walk towards [Ai Lun], [Sun Yue], and [Tai Wei].
0:52:57|0:53:5|Sun Yue slowly turned his head and looked at where [Ai Lun] was pointing, her eyes widened in surprise as they stopped in front of the three people.
0:53:9|0:53:18|[Ai Lun] and Zhang Xiaofei pointed straight at Sun Yue on the opposite side, the masked men received the instructions and immediately went forward to take Sun Yue away.
0:53:18|0:53:22|[Ai Lun] and Zhang Xiaofei smoothly took over Sun Yue's suitcase and crutch, watching as Sun Yue lay down.
0:53:35|0:53:43|The masked men first carried away the person at the top.
0:53:43|0:53:47|The car started, and through the car window, [Guo Degang] could be seen wearing a mask.
0:53:47|0:53:52|The two of them lying on the ground looked around, then saw a bicycle being dragged not far away.
0:54:11|0:54:14|Ai Lun randomly stepped on the bicycle and stood up with all his strength.
0:54:40|0:54:52|But Zhang Xiaofei in the car was warned by the woman.
0:54:52|0:55:0|Suddenly, [Ai Lun] noticed the business car taking away Tai Wei driving past in front of him, so he quickly pedaled his bicycle and chased after it with all his might from behind.
0:55:4|0:55:9|Suddenly, the front wheel rose together, it turned out that the bicycle fell backwards because it was too heavy to bear.
0:55:9|0:55:12|Sun [Guo Degang] saw the situation and used his weight advantage to land the car steadily.
0:55:35|0:55:38|[Ai Lun] looked pained, but still pedaled the bicycle with all his might.
0:55:38|0:55:41|The coachman in the back seat and Sun [Yue] kept refueling for [Ai Lun].
0:55:41|0:55:51|On the other side, a black business van suddenly brakes, with an elderly couple in wheelchairs crossing the road.
0:55:51|0:55:56|The long-haired beauty in the car fiercely elbowed the talkative Zhang [Tai Wei].
0:55:56|0:55:59|The rearview mirror in the car reflects [Ai Lun] desperately chasing after them.
0:56:2|0:56:16|[Ai Lun] and Zhang Xiaofei observed the stopped business car.
0:56:16|0:56:20|Tai Wei slapped his own mouth hard for saying the wrong thing due to his own stupidity.
0:56:20|0:56:25|The driver shifted into reverse, turned the steering wheel, and headed towards the tricycle.
0:56:40|0:56:49|The business car accelerates forward, and at this moment, the camera slows down. [Ai Lun] faces the accelerating car, lifts the front wheels of the tricycle into the air, makes an emergency turn, and the car lands smoothly on the ground.
0:56:53|0:57:1|The commercial vehicle started chasing after [Ai Lun] and he had to continue pedaling the tricycle without stopping. The commercial vehicle did not slow down at all and headed straight towards the tricycle.
0:57:1|0:57:11|The tricycle was forced onto the steps out of control, and a brick on the road caused [Sun Yue] and the driver to flip off the back seat.
0:57:11|0:57:21|At this moment, the trunk and sunroof of the car opened together. The rickshaw driver who fell from the tricycle slid into the trunk, while [Sun Yue] landed accurately from the sunroof, dropping into the arms of [Zhang Xiaofei] inside the car.
0:57:25|0:57:30|[Zhang Xiaofei] in the car was crushed by [Sun Yue] who fell from above, with a grimace on her face.
0:57:30|0:57:42|[Sun Yue] awkwardly greeted the people in the car, and the driver fell out of the trunk.
0:57:42|0:57:50|[Ai Lun] knelt down helplessly and wailed in despair, while on the other side, the frustrated team members returned to the hotel, discussing together what to do next.
0:58:4|0:58:23|[Yue Yunpeng] picked up the golden retriever gallbladder from the ground, [Ai Lun] casually grabbed a vase, with [Zhang Xiaofei] hiding behind him, they cautiously stood up and walked out of the room.
0:58:23|0:58:29|[Yue Yunpeng] first stuck his head out, with [Ai Lun] and [Zhang Xiaofei] following closely behind. [Yue Yunpeng] gestured for [Ai Lun] to go ahead.
0:58:36|0:58:43|Timid [Yue Yunpeng] nervously drops the chicken feather into the innocent bathtub.
0:58:43|0:58:48|Three people cautiously crept forward to inspect the room, when suddenly there was a loud noise coming from the cabinet.
0:58:53|0:58:55|[Ai Lun] fearfully untied the rope on the cabinet.
0:58:55|0:58:58|[Yue Yunpeng] summoned up the courage and pulled open the cabinet door.
0:58:58|0:59:3|In the cabinet was journalist [Pan Binlong], with his hands and feet tied with ropes, and his mouth gagged with a towel.
0:59:6|0:59:13|The three of them watched as the rescued journalist [Pan Binlong] wolfed down the sandwiches on the plate.
0:59:18|0:59:22|[Ai Lun] cautiously approached the sandwich on the table.
0:59:40|0:59:43|[Zhang Xiaofei] and [Guo Degang] immediately stood up straight.
0:59:45|0:59:53|[Pan Binlong] the journalist opened his phone and showed the team the photos and videos of Chen Guokun looking for [Guo Degang].
1:0:50|1:0:51|The journalist widened his eyes.
1:0:58|1:1:2|The reporter nodded in agreement, while [Yue Yunpeng] was in front holding a phone, illuminating the surroundings.
1:1:2|1:1:8|[Ai Lun] and [Zhang Xiaofei] followed behind, while [Yue Yunpeng] checked his phone and found an address.
1:1:8|1:1:9|They quickened their pace.
1:1:13|1:1:16|[Yue Yunpeng] and [Zhang Xiaofei] are listening to [Ai Lun]'s words attentively.
1:1:16|1:1:17|Three people arrived at the door.
1:1:54|1:1:59|[Ai Lun] takes off the backpack and unzips it to search for something inside.
1:1:59|1:2:6|[Ai Lun] handed something to the two of them separately.
1:2:6|1:2:9|[Yue Yunpeng] grimaced, trying hard to pull the stockings over his head.
1:2:26|1:2:35|The security guard on duty is Chen Guokun, who is dressed in a Pharaoh costume. Three people work together to tie up Chen Guokun, and they sit him on the sofa, looking bewildered.
1:2:51|1:2:54|Chen Guokun tried to escape, [Yue Yunpeng] tripped him with his leg.
1:3:10|1:3:18|[Ai Lun] handed a big knife to [Yue Yunpeng], who was sharpening the knife on his jeans.
1:3:41|1:3:50|[Yue Yunpeng] threatened Chen Guokun with a knife, which scared him into quickly trying to please him.
1:3:50|1:3:59|Chen Guokun heard the news and closed his eyes in despair. [Yue Yunpeng] accidentally cut his tongue while licking the blade.
1:3:59|1:4:1|They looked in the direction of the sound.
1:4:16|1:4:22|Turning around, it was a male dressed as the Egyptian Queen Cleopatra, with heavy makeup.
1:4:22|1:4:29|[Yue Yunpeng], [Ai Lun], and [Zhang Xiaofei] were shocked, and this scene brought tears to their eyes one after another.
1:4:29|1:4:32|They stood still in shock, while the Egyptian queen on the opposite side suddenly covered her mouth.
1:4:35|1:4:40|Chen Guokun regretted his actions upon seeing the situation, and then they tied up the Egyptian queen.
1:5:12|1:5:17|[Yue Yunpeng] pushed them into the water, and their figures could be seen faintly outside the villa.
1:5:33|1:5:42|Yue Yunpeng is still torturing Chen Guokun and the Egyptian Queen.
1:5:42|1:5:54|[Yue Yunpeng] wiped his hands and answered the video call, it was the journalist Sha Wukong on the other end of the line.
1:5:54|1:5:57|The man across from the camera looks exactly like Chen Guokun.
1:6:30|1:6:35|Ai Lun suddenly clapped his hands in realization.
1:6:35|1:6:37|[Yue Yunpeng] quickly helped them float up from the water.
1:7:3|1:7:18|The two of them, Ai Lun and Zhang Xiaofei, who were soaked in water, felt relieved and then wearily fell into the water. The three who mistakenly caught the wrong person hurriedly fled.
1:7:22|1:7:24|Yue Yunpeng patted Ai Lun on the shoulder.
1:7:47|1:7:58|A pair of speeding jet skis broke the calm sea surface, gliding like a well-trained team in formation. The jet skis left water marks on the sea surface as they zoomed past.
1:7:58|1:8:10|[Zhang Xiaofei], Ai Lun, and [Guo Degang] were sitting on the back seats of a speedboat, the roaring engine creating a deafening noise as the boat raced across the sea. The splashing water beneath the speedboat hinted that things were far from calm.
1:8:15|1:8:17|They ran to the bushes for cover.
1:8:17|1:8:21|Ai Lun accidentally hit [Zhang Xiaofei] with his glasses while gesturing.
1:8:21|1:8:25|[Zhang Xiaofei] looked at Ai Lun, who was making chaotic hand gestures, and pushed him hard.
1:8:25|1:8:29|[Yue Yunpeng] arrived panting heavily at this moment, leaving under the protection of Haige.
1:8:29|1:8:39|[Zhang Xiaofei] and [Ai Lun] arrived at the entrance of the villa. They crouched down to check the surroundings. At this moment, the exhausted [Yue Yunpeng], supported by Haige, also arrived at the entrance of the villa.
1:8:39|1:8:45|[Ai Lun] signaled everyone to keep moving forward, suddenly, many people ran out of the villa, all dressed in neat suits and wearing sunglasses.
1:8:51|1:8:57|Hai Ge, a younger brother, stepped forward and engaged in a fight with the men in suits, with both sides evenly matched.
1:9:6|1:9:12|[Yue Yunpeng], [Zhang Xiaofei], and [Ai Lun] screamed and left.
1:9:12|1:9:19|Hai Ge coolly takes off his sunglasses and throws them aside. On the other side, [Zhang Xiaofei] and [Ai Lun] finally find the villa where [Guo Degang] is located.
1:9:29|1:9:41|[Zhang Xiaofei] cautiously observed the surroundings, while [Ai Lun] took off his backpack and surprisingly pulled out an ear scoop from inside.
1:9:55|1:9:58|Before long, [Zhang Xiaofei] was covered in all sorts of strange things.
1:10:4|1:10:12|The two beauties who kidnapped [Guo Degang] are now coming out of the villa, followed by two bodyguards.
1:10:16|1:10:21|[Zhang Xiaofei] overturned everything on her body and took down the bodyguards rushing towards her with kicks and sticks.
1:10:22|1:10:26|[Ai Lun] couldn't help but applaud as he watched [Zhang Xiaofei]'s impressive combat skills.
1:10:26|1:10:30|[Zhang Xiaofei] provocatively looks at the two beautiful women, and the women are not to be outdone, jumping off the steps.
1:10:30|1:10:36|They split up, with the long-haired one chasing after [Ai Lun], while the short-haired one stayed behind to fight with [Zhang Xiaofei].
1:10:36|1:10:41|[Zhang Xiaofei] and the short-haired beauty were evenly matched, unable to determine a clear winner.
1:10:41|1:10:44|[Ai Lun] next to him was forced to the front gate with no way out.
1:10:58|1:11:5|[Ai Lun] kept shuffling the cards in his hand, and the cards flew towards the long-haired beauty in order. The long-haired beauty impatiently swatted away the flying cards.
1:11:16|1:11:24|On the other side, [Zhang Xiaofei] and the short-haired beauty were still fighting, kicking each other's legs at the same time, and then tripping each other's upper bodies.
1:11:24|1:11:31|The short-haired girl took the initiative to attack, she first tripped [Zhang Xiaofei]'s leg, causing [Zhang Xiaofei] to flip over her back.
1:11:31|1:11:36|[Zhang Xiaofei] and the short-haired beauty both let go of each other at the same time, standing still, raising their fists to confront each other in battle.
1:11:45|1:11:49|The short-haired beauty shook her left hand.
1:11:49|1:11:53|[Zhang Xiaofei] felt the pain in her left leg with her right foot.
1:12:25|1:12:31|In the villa, a man who looks very much like Chen Guokun just walked down the stairs, and [Yue Yunpeng] suddenly grabbed him from behind.
1:12:31|1:12:39|[Yue Yunpeng] tightly covers, [Yue Yunpeng] covers the man's mouth again, the man can't speak.
1:12:39|1:12:48|The man patted [Guo Degang]'s hand on his mouth, indicating him to let go.
1:12:48|1:12:54|[Yue Yunpeng] covered the man's mouth again, at this moment [Zhang Xiaofei] and [Ai Lun] arrived in time and went forward to help.
1:13:5|1:13:12|Three people brought a man to a room, where the captured team members were lying on the bed. 
1:13:12|1:13:16|In front of a bed, someone with their back facing them, their body covered tightly.
1:13:16|1:13:19|[Yue Yunpeng] ran towards the person inside.
1:13:19|1:13:25|[Yue Yunpeng] kicked down the enemy, then ruthlessly kicked the enemy a few more times, looking sorrowfully at the three people lying on the ground.
1:13:29|1:13:31|Ai Lun, Zhang Xiaofei, and Pan Binlong woke up one after another while lying in bed.
1:13:31|1:13:32|Guo Degang slowly gets up from the ground.
1:14:21|1:14:32|[Guo Degang] sat on the chair, waving his hand wearily.
1:14:32|1:14:35|[Guo Degang] takes a deep breath and starts to reminisce.
1:14:35|1:14:38|In the villa, [Guo Degang] and Chen Guokun are sitting on the sofa.
1:14:38|1:14:39|[Guo Degang] angrily looks at Chen Guokun.
1:15:44|1:15:48|Later, Chen Guokun returned home to explain to his father.
1:15:52|1:15:53|Father responds.
1:15:58|1:16:0|Chen Guokun sighed and said.
1:16:3|1:16:4|Father said.
1:16:9|1:16:16|Hurry up and send the person back, [Guo Degang] stood outside the door and accidentally overheard the conversation between the father and son.
1:17:26|1:17:29|[Guo Degang] finally explained the misunderstanding, and the team members suddenly realized.
1:17:31|1:17:33|[Guo Degang] explained, handing a long spear to Chen Guokun.
1:17:58|1:18:8|Chen Guokun twirls a long spear, then thrusts it towards [Guo Degang], followed by [Guo Degang] pretending to be stabbed in the stomach.
1:18:21|1:18:23|The misunderstanding is finally resolved, and the truth is revealed.
1:18:23|1:18:34|At the party, cheerful music is playing, the girls are beautifully dressed in gorgeous gowns, guests are chatting happily on the grass, and the men are clasping their hands together to thank the guests.
1:18:34|1:18:37|Journalist Ai Lun is still upholding professional ethics, crouching down to secretly film.
1:18:41|1:18:45|Mr. Bean walked over wearing long socks.
1:18:45|1:18:49|[Guo Degang] gestures for [Mr. Bean] and [Yue Yunpeng] to learn Chinese.
1:19:10|1:19:15|[Mr. Bean] and [Guo Degang] waved goodbye, [Yue Yunpeng] walked up to him with ill intentions.
1:19:15|1:19:21|[Mr. Bean] shook his head.
1:19:35|1:19:40|Mr. Han looked puzzled and turned to [Guo Degang], who then blushed and said shyly.
1:19:53|1:19:59|Saying that, [Yue Yunpeng] then bent down and bowed to Mr. Han Dao, who affectionately patted his lowered head.
1:20:6|1:20:19|Mr. Han spread his hands, dancing with [Guo Degang], who disdainfully rejected his white hands.
1:20:19|1:20:26|Mr. Han Dao looked at [Yue Yunpeng] in confusion, then suddenly, as if remembering something, he fumbled around and actually pulled out a clapperboard from his pocket.
1:20:26|1:20:31|Following that, Mr. Han Dao proudly started to perform a fast-paced comic dialogue, with [Guo Degang] helplessly saying.
1:20:31|1:20:57|This is useless, you don't speak Chinese. Mr. Hanno in Huaying Mountain Town... ignores [Guo Degang]'s advice and continues to perform his fast-paced routine. However, the board unexpectedly slips from his hands and hits [Guo Degang] right in the chest.
1:20:57|1:20:59|Mr. Hanno saw the situation and ran away directly.
1:21:1|1:21:16|On the other side, [Zhang Xiaofei] seemed to have learned her lesson this time. She reached out her hand and waved it in front of the handsome guy in sunglasses.
1:21:16|1:21:22|The man slowly put down his glass, coolly took off his sunglasses, and asked.
1:21:22|1:21:29|[Zhang Xiaofei] was mesmerized by the handsome guy, but it's okay, [Zhang Xiaofei] awkwardly smiled, then he turned around and excitedly opened his mouth wide.
1:21:38|1:21:39|The handsome guy takes out his business card.
1:21:46|1:21:54|[Zhang Xiaofei] was about to take the business card when Mr. Handou suddenly snatched it away. [Zhang Xiaofei] had no choice but to chase after Mr. Handou with [Yue Yunpeng].
1:21:54|1:22:4|At this moment, [Ai Lun] next to him is watching the little boy in front of him perform magic. The boy makes the cloth in his hand disappear directly. [Ai Lun] is attracted by the boy's magic and can't help but clap his hands, even kneeling down and shouting.
1:22:34|1:22:41|Tai Wei and Sun Yue reached out to grab the camera from the journalist Sha Seng, Mr. Hano pushed Sun Yue from behind.
1:23:3|1:23:9|The team just disrupted the joyful atmosphere at the gathering.
1:23:9|1:23:11|The team members chased Han Dou and ran at the party.
1:23:33|1:23:51|[Guo Degang] and Manager Wang looked helplessly at the team members. Mr. Handan fell to the ground, and Yueyunpeng pressed down on him. The team members and the journalist Sha Seng also piled on top. Sun Yue, who was at the bottom, was pressed down the most by Yueyunpeng and kept shouting in pain. Zhang Xiaofei was the last one to be pressed on top. [Guo Degang] looked shocked at the mischievous team members.
1:23:51|1:23:58|Mr. Hando, who should have been at the bottom, ran to the front of the camera instead, smiling cunningly, and then turned around gracefully.
