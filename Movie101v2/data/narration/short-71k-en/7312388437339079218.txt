0:0:41|0:0:51|In the scene, a man in a shirt takes out a bunch of flowers from a luxury car and gives them to Qin Shunxin, the younger daughter of the mother in this film.
0:0:51|0:0:53|Qin Shunyi looked at the flowers and said with a smile.
0:1:3|0:1:6|Next, the producer [Li Mu Zi] brought a bouquet of flowers.
0:2:2|0:2:6|In a blink of an eye, elder brother [Qin Shunli] arrived at the home of [Mother] with his wife Qianzhu.
0:3:25|0:3:31|In the next scene, the eldest sister [Qin Shunyi] and her family of three are driving towards their mother's house.
0:3:53|0:3:57|[Qin Shunyi] smiled indulgently and soon arrived at [Mother]'s house.
0:4:15|0:4:21|Come on, [Mother] carefully examined Tongtong and said.
0:5:40|0:5:43|He looked at the two of them disdainfully, furrowing his brow and said.
0:6:40|0:6:48|In the meeting room, [Qin Shunxin] pushed the door open and [Li Muzi] immediately sat up straight, his voice no longer lazy.
0:7:3|0:7:5|[Qin Shunxin] sighed helplessly.
0:9:5|0:9:7|In the garden, [Qin Shunli] is tending to the flowers and plants.
0:9:27|0:9:29|[Father] humbly picked up the broken plate.
0:10:1|0:10:6|[Qin Shunli] proudly performed acrobatics again, but accidentally dropped the plate. Meanwhile, [Qin Shunyi] was making a phone call.
0:11:9|0:11:13|[Qin Shunxin] stood up and turned his back to Mr. Quan, hiding the needle in the seam of the paper.
0:11:55|0:11:59|In the next moment, he was pricked by the needle hidden in [Qin Shunxin]'s hand.
0:11:59|0:12:2|[Qin Shunxin] finished scolding and then stood up, walking towards the office desk.
0:12:2|0:12:5|Mr. Quan looked at her in disbelief.
0:12:22|0:12:22|The scene shifts to the home of [Qin Shunli].
0:13:13|0:13:15|In the blink of an eye, the young couple arrived at [Mother]'s house.
0:14:44|0:14:44|[Qin Shunli] stood up and spoke with a serious expression on his face.
0:15:28|0:15:31|On the other side, [Qin Shunxin], who had just arrived home, received a phone call from [Mother].
0:16:11|0:16:14|[Qin Shunxin] hung up the phone and walked into the conference room, where [Li Muzi] was sitting at the head of the table and spoke first.
0:16:14|0:16:16|The manager took the letter from [Qin Shunxin] and spoke.
0:17:15|0:17:19|Saying that, [Li Muzi] packed up and walked out of the meeting room, wanting to run all the way, and came to [Qin Shunxin]'s front.
0:19:18|0:19:20|[The mother] saw her husband say this.
0:19:20|0:19:24|Qin Shunli walked away with a cold snort of grievance, turned his back, and angrily pulled a tree leaf, saying.
0:20:1|0:20:2|[Qin Shunli's Mother] gave her a stern look and spoke.
0:20:2|0:20:4|[Qin Shunli] furrowed her brow and continued.
0:20:38|0:20:42|[Mother] turned around in anger and walked away, cursing as she left.
0:22:49|0:22:52|Upon hearing this, [Qin Shunyi] looked at her husband, lost in thought.
0:22:58|0:23:2|[The mother] had just changed the channel when [Qin Shunli] took the remote and changed it back.
0:23:2|0:23:4|Qin Shunyi, feeling pleased with herself, received the situation with a smug expression.
0:23:22|0:23:29|In a sports program, as the lively song played, [Qin Shunli] saw [his mother] tucking the remote control into her arms. He immediately stood up, walked to the TV, and turned it off.
0:23:42|0:23:50|His dad, look at your son, who has already entered dreamland, was called up. He turned around and looked at his son, then smiled.
0:24:21|0:24:31|[The mother] watched as the group of people trying to hold back their laughter walked away angrily, then walked over to her son and threw the remote control at him.
0:25:12|0:25:14|[Qin Shunxin] looked at the two of them and pointed at Lin Muzi, speaking.
0:25:51|0:25:54|The four of them closed the car doors and set off towards home.
0:25:54|0:25:56|In the car, [Qin Shunyi] spoke up and asked.
0:26:24|0:26:25|[Qin Shunli] as soon as this new army arrived.
0:26:41|0:26:50|This is [Mother] turning her head to see [Li Muzi] returning with her daughter. She carefully scrutinizes her from head to toe, then casts a look of disdain.
0:27:45|0:27:47|Their movements synchronized, their expressions turning sorrowful.
0:28:12|0:28:14|[Qin Shunyi] turned around and went back to the kitchen.
0:31:43|0:31:51|After [Li Muzi] finished speaking, the whole family was stunned.
0:32:11|0:32:15|[The mother] frowned and looked at [Qin Shunyi] accusingly.
0:32:40|0:32:44|Tong Tong looked at the two confronting figures and said to [Li Mu Zi].
0:33:41|0:33:48|Watching, drinking, and eating at the same time, they are very interesting.
0:34:9|0:34:11|[Father] arranged for [Li Muzi] to go out, [Qin Shunxin] looked at the two of them by the river and spoke.
0:34:30|0:34:36|After speaking, [Qin Shunyi] turned around, picked up her bag, and left. [Mother] sat angrily in the chair, then turned the artillery towards [Qin Shunyi] and began to reprimand her.
0:35:21|0:35:25|The person full of anger, [Qin Shunli], returned home dejectedly.
0:35:25|0:35:27|The building clutched its stomach and said to [Qin Shunli].
0:35:40|0:35:48|After speaking, Qianzhu stood up, poured wine for Qin Shunli, and Qin Shunli sat on the chair, drinking one cup after another in a gloomy mood.
0:35:59|0:36:5|On the other side, Zhu Wensheng, who returned home first, was anxiously pacing around at home, finally waiting for Qin Shunyi to return.
0:36:35|0:36:41|[Qin Shunli] raised his glass and drank it all, while [Qin Shunyi] took a sip and watched his younger brother disperse.
0:37:7|0:37:8|[Qin Shunyi] is lost in memories.
0:37:34|0:37:43|[Qin Shunyi] didn't expect that just by saying a few words, [Mother] would directly smash the plate on the ground. With a wry smile, [Qin Shunli] spoke up.
0:37:43|0:37:48|[Qin Shunli] was knitting on the sofa. Seeing this, [Qin Shunyi] walked up with a smile and said.
0:37:58|0:38:2|Qin Shunyi also picked up the wine glass and drank it all in one gulp.
0:38:32|0:38:35|He trembled as he picked up the wine glass and continued to pour.
0:38:36|0:38:39|On the other side, [Qin Shunyi] and [Li Muzi] walked out.
0:39:3|0:39:9|[Qin Shunyi] finished speaking and then turned and walked away, leaving [Li Muzi] standing alone on the street, holding the luggage blankly.
0:39:23|0:39:24|The next morning, [Qin Shunli] went fishing by the river.
0:39:47|0:39:50|[Qin Shunxin] slowly opened his eyes and looked at his [mother].
0:39:50|0:39:51|[Qin Shunli] heard this and walked to the vase, reluctant to say.
0:41:10|0:41:14|[Qin Shunyi] looked at [Mother] with a proud expression, feeling so happy that she could hardly stop smiling.
0:41:14|0:41:21|The receptionist watched as Manager Qin Shunli entered the company, and shortly after, Supervisor Qin Shunyi came out. The receptionist bowed and spoke.
0:41:21|0:41:25|The manager walked by, greeted by the front desk, but when it was [Li Muzi]'s turn to come out, there was only a cold snort.
0:41:25|0:41:26|At home, [Qin Shunxin] sat outside reading a magazine when the [Qin Shunyi] family arrived.
0:43:43|0:43:45|Shunyi has no choice but to go and cook first.
0:43:45|0:43:49|At the dining table, [Qin Shunyi] and Tongtong sat together gnawing on chicken legs.
0:43:49|0:43:50|[Mother] had just sat down when [Qin Shunyi] spoke.
0:44:26|0:44:28|Shunyi looked outside, hesitating to speak.
0:44:46|0:45:4|[Zhu Wensheng] was stunned when he heard this, not saying a word. Unable to bear it, [Mother] looked up and glared at [Qin Shunyi], who also refused to back down and immediately returned the glare. The two of them then began a silent confrontation. In the end, [Mother] was the one who gave in, bowing her head and quietly eating. Just as she took a bite and spat it out, about to speak,
0:45:4|0:45:6|Qin Shunyi, who also spat it out, spoke up.
0:45:46|0:46:13|I know you have been clever and likable since childhood, but don't forget that I, your sister who is only half an hour older than you, have already started to choke up when our parents were busy working. [Zhu Wensheng] looked at her with a heart full of pity, "I help you with laundry and take care of you, who told you to be so silly," [Qin Shunyi] took a sip of wine and said slowly, "This is called division of labor in society." "Alright," [Qin Shunyi] finished speaking and lowered her head.
0:46:13|0:46:14|[Qin Shunli's Mother] looked at [Qin Shunyi] with a face full of distress, and she didn't say anything to pick on while eating with her head down.
0:47:0|0:47:2|On the other side, the hostess said to [Qin Shunli],
0:47:14|0:47:16|Seeing the master leaning happily on [Qin Shunli], on the other side, [Qin Shunyi] looked at [Father] and said,
0:47:45|0:47:49|[Qin Shunyi] passed by from the side, bent over, just about to sit down, when [Qin Shunli] spoke up.
0:51:27|0:51:32|After speaking, [Mother] helped Qian Zhu walk away.
0:51:32|0:51:33|At this moment, [Qin Shunli] ran over and said.
0:52:25|0:52:27|On the other side of the table, [Qin Shunxin] watched the couple enjoying their meal with great pleasure.
0:53:29|0:53:32|[Qin Shunli's Mother] gave [Qin Shunyi] a stern look and said.
0:53:37|0:53:37|[Qin Shunyi] still had a nonchalant expression on his face and said.
0:55:53|0:55:58|After eating a meal that made [Ma Dongmei] sweat profusely, she wiped her sweat and looked around, saying.
0:55:58|0:56:2|Qin Shunyi suddenly felt a sharp pain, interrupting the conversation. Qin Shunli and Qin Shunyi quickly called an ambulance and took Qin Shunyi to the hospital.
0:56:22|0:56:25|[Mother] happened to walk to the door and overheard the conversation.
0:57:10|0:57:16|[Qin Shunli] listened to Qianzhu's words at the door, slowly lowered her head, and her eyes became moist.
0:58:52|0:59:3|After hearing this, [Father] sat down with a pale face, brought back by [Qin Shunyi], only to see the man speaking again.
0:59:3|0:59:8|Hearing this, [Father] nodded with his mouth open, while [Mother] turned pale.
1:0:3|1:0:11|In the company, [Li Muzi] arrived early at the empty meeting room.
1:0:11|1:0:14|He placed the documents one by one on the seat, rehearsing in advance.
1:0:17|1:0:21|The screen was looking down at the documents, completely unaware that his colleagues were coming up behind him one after another.
1:0:45|1:0:50|[Li Muzi] looked at the script attentively, completely unaware of the crowd behind him, and then spoke:
1:1:2|1:1:5|The scene shifts, [Qin Shunxin] accompanies [Mother] to the shopping mall.
1:2:4|1:2:9|At night, the mother and daughter were lying in bed when [the mother] suddenly spoke.
1:2:43|1:2:48|[Qin Shunyi] looked at the coat in his hand, didn't react for a moment, and then put it on.
1:3:23|1:3:26|[Qin Shunli] and [Qin Shunyi] opened the door and were thrilled to see their home beautifully renovated by the new tenant.
1:4:39|1:4:44|Early in the morning, [Mother] came to [Qin Shunyi]'s bedroom with flowers, threw the flowers away, and frowned.
1:5:2|1:5:4|In the evening, [Qin Shunyi] brought back another man.
1:5:4|1:5:7|He came to the sofa, took out a handkerchief, cleared his throat before sitting down.
1:5:10|1:5:11|[Qin Shunyi] is a clean and sensible person, you could say.
1:8:6|1:8:11|When Qin Shunli left, it felt like the world was in chaos.
1:10:59|1:11:10|In the company, the secretary placed a document in front of [Li Muzi] and said.
1:11:19|1:11:21|Li Muzi looked at everyone, shrugged helplessly.
1:11:21|1:11:25|On the other side, [Qin Shunli] and his group returned home panting, the three of them exhausted and sitting on the sofa.
1:11:50|1:11:59|Jianzhu supported his waist with one hand and took out a property certificate from his bag with the other hand.
1:11:59|1:12:3|The building glanced at [Qin Shunli], walked over and said with a smile.
1:12:44|1:12:50|[Qin Shunli] stopped halfway through what she was saying, furrowed her brow and let out a heavy sigh before continuing.
1:14:46|1:14:51|[Qin Shunli's Mother] grabbed [Qin Shunyi], who was about to leave, and whispered a few words in her ear.
1:15:6|1:15:10|At the dining table, people hurriedly picked up food with their chopsticks.
1:16:32|1:16:32|[Qin Shunyi] put down the chopsticks and left without looking back.
1:16:32|1:16:34|[The mother] looked at [Qin Shunyi] with a worried frown, snatched the wine glass from [the father's] hand, and drank it all in one gulp.
1:17:3|1:17:9|In the dance studio, a group of hot girls in tight clothes are swaying their waists, practicing the dance over and over again.
1:17:9|1:17:13|They all smiled and sweated as if they were tireless.
1:17:13|1:17:17|At this moment, [Mr. Quan] quietly entered through the back door.
1:17:17|1:17:21|She took off her sunglasses, looked up and down at the girls, and kept making clicking sounds with her mouth.
1:22:14|1:22:25|[Qin Shunyi] shed tears in grievance, rushed out the door, leaving [Mother] at a loss for a moment. In the blink of an eye, outside the restaurant, [Qin Shunli] helped the star walk out.
1:22:34|1:22:45|The two arrived at the first stop, a hair salon, where under the stylist's hands, [Qin Shunli]'s hair was styled in various ways, sometimes up, sometimes down, sometimes curled, changing into ten different hairstyles.
1:22:45|1:22:54|In the second stop, they arrived at a clothing store. [Mother] tried on more than ten outfits in one go, while [Qin Shunyi] patiently picked out each piece until they found clothes that both of them were satisfied with.
1:22:59|1:23:18|I arrived home, [Qin Shunyi] pushed the well-dressed [mother] in front of [father]. [Father] put down the newspaper and looked up slowly, his mouth hanging open in shock. [Mother] stood there looking pleased, while [father] stood up, walked around [mother], and couldn't stop exclaiming in amazement.
1:23:51|1:24:0|The scene shifts, and [Qin Shunyi][Zhu Wensheng] arrive at Xishan School in Fujian, where they see a large crowd of young spectators gathered on the school playground.
1:24:0|1:24:8|They were dressed in clean and tidy school uniforms, sitting neatly on small stools, watching the performance on stage attentively.
1:24:8|1:24:13|Tongtong on stage, dressed in a beautiful traditional costume, gracefully dancing the yangko dance.
1:24:13|1:24:18|She skillfully twirled the handkerchief in her hand, the fabric dancing as if alive.
1:24:19|1:24:27|In the next moment, [Qin Shunli] unleashed a powerful move, effortlessly performing a backflip that caused the audience to scream in excitement, with applause filling the room.
1:24:27|1:24:33|After the performance, Tongtong stood on the two corners of the stage, and the host presented her with a large trophy.
1:25:16|1:25:25|Tongtong, back home, stood in front of the timer, performing a hand-switching routine for everyone.
1:27:40|1:27:45|Time flies, and in the blink of an eye, we arrive at the Three Provinces of the Ming Dynasty. Fireworks are set off in every household, and the family of [Qin Shunyi] is also gathered together.
1:28:54|1:28:59|[Qin Shunyi] noticed something was wrong, turned around, and found [Qin Shunli] standing beside her.
