0:7:35|0:7:56|Li Jiang withdrew his gaze and silently smoked a cigarette. He looked at [Wu Lin] with a hint of doubt, only to see him take out an urn from his bag and place it heavily on the round table. Li Jiang took a puff of smoke, stood up woodenly, held the urn in his hands, slowly lifted his head, and cried silently with his forehead against the urn.
0:8:11|0:8:25|[Wu Lin] is doing a handstand on top of a crystal ashtray, sweat dripping continuously from his wet hairline. With legs clad in iron shoes spread out to both sides, Li Jiang watches him, lost in memories.
0:8:31|0:8:39|Young Li Jiang kneels on the ground, I, [Iron-leg Master], will never spare those who steal and rob.
0:9:0|0:9:25|Li Jiang, who is thin and weak, lies in the rain with visible scars all over his body. In a dark hall, various armors are displayed, and in a side hall, there is a huge iron cage where a tiger leisurely walks around. There is still half a piece of raw meat under the tiger's feet, but it pays no attention to it. Its eyes are fixed on the outside of the cage. Sitting beside the hall is an old man with white beard and hair, [Fomian].
0:9:25|0:9:34|Wearing round-framed sunglasses on the bridge of his nose, a mysterious figure with a cane sat on the central dragon chair, while a man with long hair knelt in the middle of the hall begging for mercy.
0:9:36|0:9:52|Sitting on the dragon throne with a top hat on his head is [Fomian], as the eight-faced star approaches.
0:9:56|0:10:15|White-bearded [Master] frowned, and the Bamian Shaxing next to him fired a shot at the person kneeling beside him. The person fell to the ground, and two bodyguards rushed forward, each grabbing a leg and dragging him to the iron cage in the side hall. A tiger in the cage was dozing, but as soon as it saw someone approaching the cage, it immediately pounced towards him.
0:10:15|0:10:43|On the undulating hills by the river, the cold city of Linjiang has erected a steel forest, with tall and dense buildings shrouded in the thin mist from the river. A fortress-like building with a tiger head emblem hangs above the entrance, and the high walls on both sides of the gate are inscribed with the words "loyal to its master, willing to sacrifice one's life" in eight large characters. Three luxury cars are parked in front of the gate. Li Jiang, wearing sunglasses, gets out of the car from the left side and walks around to stand beside [Wu Lin]. After [Wu Lin] gets out of the car and looks up at the tiger head emblem above.
0:10:43|0:11:3|Li Jiang put his arm around his shoulder and walked towards the door. The heavy King Kong door slowly opened from both sides, with two rows of black-clad bodyguards standing neatly on both sides of the passage. Li Jiang walked in front with his hands in his pockets, leading the way into the security checkpoint, where the laser array shone on [Wu Lin].
0:11:4|0:11:10|[Wu Lin] was stopped by the security guard for a check, and he and Li Jiang both looked down at the iron shoes on their feet.
0:11:10|0:11:44|[Wu Lin] looked up at [Li Jiang], who smiled at him and gestured to the bodyguards to let them pass. [Li Jiang] put his arm around [Wu Lin] and walked into the training ground. [Li Jiang] stood at the edge of zone A, watching the bodyguards in training following orders and punching in unison. A man with an O-shaped beard appeared, reminding [Li Jiang] that a client had arrived. He was [Fu Tou], [Li Jiang]'s assistant. [Li Jiang] kept pacing back and forth among the bodyguards in the training formation.
0:11:44|0:12:19|After observing for a while, [Li Jiang] calmly smiled and gestured for [Li Jiang] to look behind him. [Fu Tou] brought a person holding a stone tablet, with [Giant King Kong] followed by [Iron-head King Kong] and [Fighting King Kong] appearing behind him. [Giant King Kong] glared angrily, while [Iron-head King Kong] did a somersault and stood upside down on the stone tablet. [Giant King Kong] then smashed down on [Iron-head King Kong]'s feet, splitting the stone tablet in half instantly. [Fighting King Kong] continuously kicked at [Iron-head King Kong]'s abdomen, causing [Li Jiang] to look away in disgust.
0:12:19|0:12:27|The crowd heard the dog barking and turned back, only to see [Wu Lin] sitting on the wall of the dog cage, teasing the dog with a piece of bread tied to a rope.
0:13:8|0:13:22|[Wu Lin] calmly turned and walked away, while [Li Jiang] lowered his gaze, staring intently at the iron shoes on [Wu Lin]'s feet. His eyes twitched slightly as he sat with his hands on his shoulders in the luxurious box. After [Li Jiang] swallowed the pill, he asked him.
0:13:31|0:13:56|[Wu Lin] faintly smiled, looking out the window. The booming music in the nightclub was deafening, and the dazzling lights were dazzling. [Li Feifei] sat in a booth filled with bottles of alcohol, wearing a tight-fitting dress and heavy makeup on her face. She kept drinking without looking back, tearing up a photo of herself and her ex and throwing the pieces into the air.
0:14:3|0:14:29|[Li Jiang] always takes [Wu Lin] into this nightclub. He feels uncomfortable with the lights after taking off his glasses, so he can only squint and look around for his daughter. As [Li Jiang] and [Wu Lin] pass by the bar, they see a man in black carrying a woman. [Li Jiang] looks up and indeed it is [Li Feifei]. [Wu Lin] knocks down the bald leader with a left hook and then crushes the bottle thrown at them.
0:14:29|0:14:54|The young man was hit by [Wu Lin] and flew out, ending the dispute hastily. Inside the villa, [Li Jiang] always sat beside the sleeping [Li Feifei]. Soon, he picked up his bag and got into a luxury car. The first light of dawn pierced through the clouds as the sun rose from the horizon. The mist on the glass door of the bathroom reflected the graceful figure of [Li Feifei] as she walked out wrapped in a towel.
0:14:54|0:15:12|With damp long hair tied behind her head, [Li Feifei] let her hair down, with a few unique highlights in her black hair. She took out a bottle of tea from the fridge, and saw through the mirror on the fridge that the bottle fell from [Wu Lin]'s hand to the ground. Her towel also slipped off.
0:15:17|0:15:25|[Li Feifei] angrily threw her phone, tossed a stack of money on the coffee table, and sat down fiercely.
0:15:50|0:16:0|[Wu Lin] lowered his eyelids without saying a word, while [Li Feifei] stood up and paced back and forth, impatiently running her fingers through her hair. Suddenly, she had a moment of inspiration and sat back down next to [Wu Lin].
0:16:11|0:16:18|[Li Feifei] took the cushion and placed it on her lap.
0:17:3|0:17:30|[Li Feifei] stood up speechlessly and left. In a blink of an eye, she was driving and shouting, "You call yourself a bodyguard but can't even drive." She drove a Pontiac sports car and glanced at [Wu Lin]. [Wu Lin] looked at her, extended his hand pointing forward. [Li Feifei] turned her head and continued driving, her subtle expression hidden behind sunglasses. There were gropers in the square, and the gang leader kicked people around fiercely.
0:17:39|0:17:46|[Li Feifei] smiled charmingly and gave the leader a slap, then pointed to [Wu Lin] who was leaving gracefully behind her. [Wu Lin] explained.
0:17:49|0:18:13|[Li Feifei] ran frantically and quickly sought help from [Wu Lin]. [Li Feifei] complained that the thugs were chasing her from behind. She rushed down the spiral staircase and quickly turned back, realizing her mistake. [Li Feifei] fell on the stairs, while [Wu Lin] swiftly grabbed the leader by the neck.
0:18:27|0:18:40|[Wu Lin] held the leader up to the railing, the leader hanging in the air begging for mercy. The night on the riverbank was bustling, with towering buildings all around, and the shimmering lights creating a dazzling scene.
0:18:40|0:19:8|A stunning beauty with a tall figure walked towards [Wu Lin] in strappy high heels. She was wearing a low-cut dress, her hand first supporting her full chest, lifting the waves of her side face. [Wu Lin] looked at her with dull eyes as the beauty spun in front of him. Her circular necklace and tassel earrings seemed to shine even more. With a seductive look, she walked towards [Wu Lin], lifting the curls behind her head and swaying her waist slightly.
0:19:8|0:19:23|The beauty looked at [Wu Lin] with shiny eyes, approaching it like a little wild cat. This angle allowed [Wu Lin] to have a full view of her curves. The beauty climbed onto [Wu Lin]'s knees, continuing to sway her waist to show off her charm.
0:19:23|0:19:42|The beauty stood up and used her fingertips to touch [Wu Lin]'s face, then gently lifted his chin with her finger pads, making eye contact with him. When [Wu Lin] looked into her eyes, she turned around, slid her hands along the curve of her waist to his perky buttocks, and then sat on [Wu Lin]'s thigh.
0:19:42|0:20:7|The beauty suddenly froze, her eyes staring blankly at [Wu Lin]. [Wu Lin] had a hint of a mysterious smile at the corner of his mouth, looking at the beauty's hand reaching towards his crotch, slowly raising his eyes to watch the beauty's reaction like watching a show. The beauty's hand seemed to touch something, her eyes gradually changing from doubt to incredulity. She nervously swallowed, immediately stood up in a panic and rushed down the stairs.
0:20:7|0:20:20|[Wu Lin] smiled smugly, took out a copper scroll tube from his waist, and a beauty rushed down the corridor, panting, holding [Li Feifei]'s hand.
0:20:24|0:20:59|[Wu Lin] lurked in the yard of the villa, looking at the jungle stealthily. [Li Feifei] stood by the window, hands on hips, watching him. In the dead of night, all was quiet. [Wu Lin] as usual, floated into a dream state with a split in mid-air. A little girl in a white dress ran into the garden, while a man in a shirt and vest led a boy with a cloud tattoo on his inner arm towards the woods at the foot of the mountain. They reached the edge of a cliff, as the distance between them and the cliff shortened.
0:20:59|0:21:22|Wu Lin's sweat kept dripping, and in front of the glass door pushed open by the girl in a white dress on the balcony was a woman in a long dress hanging, at the cliff edge, the man also threw the boy into the abyss, Li Feifei and Wu Lin woke up from the dream at the same time, at this moment, several black-clothed men sneaked into the garden outside the villa, the only person wearing a white mask held his companion's shoulder.
0:21:22|0:21:27|He noticed the steel wire hanging in the air and gestured for everyone to retreat.
0:21:27|0:21:32|In the house, [Wu Lin] noticed the faint movement of the bell on the steel wire, in the dimly lit hall,
0:21:44|0:22:9|Standing aside, the fair-skinned old man said, "[Bamian Shaxing]," then continued, "[Fomian]" slowly stood up from in front of the iron cage, pointing a gun at the white beard. [Fomian]'s brow furrowed, the tiger in the cage leisurely chewing on sinewy meat, while the white-bearded old man lay in a pool of blood.
0:22:9|0:22:18|Bamian Shaxing glanced at Fomian and quickly looked away.
0:22:18|0:22:25|His pupils were trembling uncontrollably out of fear, and his jaw muscles were clenched.
0:22:25|0:22:50|In a star-rated restaurant in Lengcheng, a waiter in a white shirt and black bow tie smiled and bowed, but [Wu Lin] in front of him stared coldly without any gratitude. The waiter's mouth twitched awkwardly in response to [Wu Lin]. [Li Feifei] looked disdainfully at [Wu Lin] as he continued to enjoy his steak. A female waiter carrying red wine descended the stairs and approached [Li Feifei] with a tray.
0:22:50|0:22:56|Pouring a little red wine into his tall glass, [Wu Lin] suddenly pressed the waitress down on the table.
0:23:11|0:23:28|The manager took a sip from the wine glass, [Li Feifei] glanced at [Wu Lin], who looked at the year on the bottle and said, leaving the manager stunned. [Li Feifei] was so angry that she couldn't speak, glaring at [Wu Lin] for a few seconds before slamming the table and storming off, cursing loudly in the restroom.
0:23:48|0:24:2|Li Feifei accidentally fell from [Wu Lin], who quickly scanned around. Li Feifei sat on the ground crying and pleading.
0:24:12|0:24:40|[Wu Lin] was surrounded by a group of men, and Li Feifei quickly slipped away. The two waiters in the restaurant dragged Li Feifei into a car, and when they saw [Wu Lin] about to rush over, the men immediately grabbed him. [Wu Lin] punched those men into the fountain, and the cold-blooded female King Kong in leather ran over and delivered a spinning kick to [Wu Lin], then continuously slashed at him with a knife. [Wu Lin] threw her into the fountain, and by the time the cold-blooded King Kong got up, he had already run far away from the water pool.
0:24:40|0:25:6|[Wu Lin] jumped over the green belt and rushed onto the road to hijack Li Feifei's van. Coincidentally, the white masked man who visited the garden at night last time was sitting in the car. [Wu Lin] ran desperately behind the van, while two attendants tightly covered Li Feifei's mouth. The driver suddenly shifted gears and stepped on the gas pedal. Seeing this, [Wu Lin] ran up the overpass, and saw the van speeding under the bridge. Quickly crossing the bridge, [Wu Lin] leaped down from the railing.
0:25:6|0:25:27|Steadily landing on the roof of the car, unexpectedly there was a bridge tunnel with a height limit of two meters ahead. [Wu Lin] instantly lay flat as the car entered the tunnel, and as it emerged from the tunnel, immediately performed a carp stance lying on the roof of the car. The van drove into the crowded traffic, desperately swerving to shake off [Wu Lin], crazily changing lanes. Suddenly, the car turned into the non-motorized vehicle lane, recklessly cutting through traffic.
0:25:27|0:25:38|Directly hitting the road cones in the restricted area, [Wu Lin] still firmly clung to the roof of the car. The driver fiercely turned the steering wheel, and the van swayed from side to side as it moved forward on the road.
0:25:38|0:25:43|[Wu Lin] clung to the roof of the car, but his legs were flung around like windshield wipers in a storm.
0:25:50|0:26:16|[Wu Lin] quickly got up and chased after, the van rushed towards Lu Chuan, driving straight into the corridor of the commercial street. [Wu Lin] ran to the iron ladder outside the building, the van happened to pass below. He quickly jumped down from the iron ladder, flipped over the giant signboard outside the building, floated from the window to the cabinet on the third floor of the mall, safely landing with a somersault. [Wu Lin] followed the direction of the van, running and jumping all the way to the railing on the third-floor walkway.
0:26:16|0:26:34|The masked man in the car looked up, [Wu Lin] suddenly stopped and leaped from the third floor to the corridor on the second floor, then jumped from the second floor walkway to the top of the pavilion on the first floor. He flew over the pavilion, jumped down from the edge of the pavilion, and landed heavily on the table in the leisure area.
0:26:34|0:27:4|Seeing the van driving away, he smashed through the flower bed in the leisure area like an iron man, and chased after it. [Wu Lin] ran after the van as it rushed out of the open-air mall. The van returned to the road, suddenly slammed on the brakes and stopped. The masked man got out and fixed his gaze ahead. [Wu Lin] stood in the middle of the road with clenched fists. The driver lightly stepped on the gas pedal, sweat dripping from [Wu Lin]'s chin as he stared at the driver. The driver was also sweating profusely at that moment.
0:27:4|0:27:9|He suddenly stepped on the gas pedal, and [Wu Lin] fearlessly drove straight towards the van.
0:27:9|0:27:36|At the moment of the imminent collision, he flew up, legs together, and kicked through the windshield. [Wu Lin] crashed into the back seat, punched the masked man out of the windshield, and threw the two fake waiters out of the side windows. Holding [Li Feifei]'s hand, [Wu Lin] kicked open the trunk, helped [Li Feifei] jump out of the car, and then saw two more cars of reinforcements behind the masked man. He immediately grabbed [Li Feifei] and fled the scene.
0:27:41|0:27:51|[Li Feifei] ran on the road with 10-centimeter high heels along with [Wu Lin], while the masked men heard the sirens and had to put away their long knives and quickly retreat.
0:27:51|0:27:56|[Wu Lin] holds [Li Feifei] tightly and runs forward with all his strength, with the moon hanging high in the sky.
0:28:42|0:28:59|[Wu Lin] closed his mouth with dissatisfaction, got up and walked into the room, unaware that [Li Feifei] was smiling slyly with pursed lips as he left, like a young girl experiencing her first crush.
0:29:0|0:29:6|On the bedside table in the bedroom, there is a family photo with the father's face deliberately cut off.
0:29:6|0:29:32|Li Feifei, in a nightgown, holding a photo frame with tears in her eyes, used her fingertips to touch her mother's face in the photo. In the photo, her mother was holding her father's arm, and her father was holding a young Li Feifei. Looking up, Li Feifei's tears and snot were hanging on her face. In the cold financial building, Bamian Shaxing sat at the desk with his eyes closed, while Li Jiang sat on the sofa with a cigar.
0:29:32|0:29:55|You are the person Mr. Wu Lin respects the most in his life. I hope you won't disappoint him. Li Jiang exhaled two puffs of smoke from his nostrils after hearing this. Bamian Shaxing, with an unhappy expression, stood up from the leather chair and walked slowly to Li Jiang's side. He stared down at Li Jiang and warned him,
0:30:0|0:30:9|Bamian Shaxing walked back slowly, Li Jiang's eyes relaxed and then tightened, his hand holding the cigar moved away slightly, as if hesitating about something.
0:30:9|0:30:18|On the terrace of the villa, [Wu Lin] leaned on the railing with both hands, looking up at the starry night sky, memories flooding into his mind.
0:30:36|0:30:58|The bright and cold sky was vast and white, setting off the lonely and desolate figure of [Wu Lin]. From then on, he practiced day and night on the cliff where he fell in his childhood. The spot where [Wu Lin] practiced was only a step away from the cliff, with a narrow path at his feet that could make one step into the void.
0:30:58|0:31:8|Countless days and nights, under the lingering sunset glow above his head, surrounded by towering mountains, [Wu Lin] tirelessly practiced the 108 techniques.
0:31:8|0:31:31|Many years ago, [Master] saved him in the woods and took him as his disciple, using a branding iron to imprint a martial character on his left chest. Under the guidance of [Master], he and his senior brother practiced horse stance, lifted barbells, raised heavy objects with both arms, held sandbags on their chests, and the difficulty of training increased daily. When they did handstands, they had to jump up at any time to avoid [Master]'s cane.
0:31:32|0:31:46|The senior brothers have to carry the weight of [Master] while lifting a tree trunk. [Wu Lin] practices iron leg skills by hanging upside down, with legs together and head submerged in a water pool, holding breath for a long time before performing a split kick in the air and coming up to breathe.
0:31:46|0:32:7|[Wu Lin] chose to practice at the edge of a cliff and in the garden after reaching adulthood. As he finished his moves, a slight frown appeared on his forehead. He remembered the masked man in the van throwing punches at him. He wore a wolf head ring on his middle finger. When he reunited with [Li Jiang] in the cold city, Fu Tou, who was by [Li Jiang]'s side, also wore this ring.
0:32:9|0:32:39|[Wu Lin] suddenly opened his eyes and kicked towards the nearby orchid, but didn't touch a single leaf of it. After he left, the orchid unexpectedly broke off from the middle of the flower mirror. [Wu Lin] arrived at the steel factory where [Li Jiang] was waiting for him. [Li Jiang] answered with his hands on the railing of the terrace.
0:33:3|0:33:18|[Wu Lin], wearing polarized sunglasses, but his gaze never fell on [Li Jiang]. [Li Jiang] turned and asked him, "Have you fallen in love with that girl?" [Li Jiang] walked straight towards the factory building, with [Wu Lin] following closely after taking off his sunglasses.
0:34:0|0:34:22|His body leaned forward to attack [Wu Lin], who kept retreating step by step, leaning against the iron net like a beehive. [Li Jiang] threw a straight punch at [Wu Lin], but he dodged it, smashing through the factory's electrical box. [Li Jiang] abandoned his fist technique and kicked towards [Wu Lin]. He locked [Wu Lin]'s neck with both hands, continuously kneeing his abdomen, but was strictly defended against.
0:34:22|0:34:39|[Li Jiang] punched [Wu Lin] onto the iron net, [Wu Lin] half-knelt on the lime bag, his left foot slowly stretched out, his bangs covering one eye, unable to hide the fighting spirit in his eyes. [Wu Lin] flew towards [Li Jiang] on the iron net, his fists falling on [Li Jiang]'s chest like raindrops.
0:34:41|0:34:46|[Wu Lin] threw a heavy punch, [Li Jiang] dodged to the side, and they both knelt down facing each other for a few seconds.
0:34:46|0:34:53|[Li Jiang] grabbed [Wu Lin]'s arm and threw him to the side, followed by a fierce kick. [Wu Lin] slid to the wall and immediately got up.
0:34:53|0:34:57|Li Jiang's punches and kicks kept coming at him without stopping.
0:34:59|0:35:11|[Li Jiang] left a series of fist prints on the wall behind [Wu Lin]. [Wu Lin] landed a punch on [Li Jiang]'s waist, causing him to take three steps up the wall. After spinning in the air, [Wu Lin] kicked [Li Jiang] on the back of his head.
0:35:11|0:35:39|[Li Jiang] rolled several meters away, he quickly got up from the ground, his eyes full of anger. He suddenly tore off a corner of his shirt, [Wu Lin] looked at [Li Jiang] in surprise as he lowered his hands. After [Li Jiang] finished speaking, the muscles on his face twitched, and he stood unsteadily in a five-body posture. [Li Jiang] also stood up, and the two of them silently confronted each other for a while. [Li Jiang] left first.
0:35:39|0:36:10|There were still shreds of his torn clothes on the ground. [Wu Lin] sighed lightly as he watched his departing figure. [Li Feifei] drove [Wu Lin] through the dim tunnel, memories overlapping. Surprisingly, the words of his father and [Li Jiang] were strangely consistent. [Wu Lin] came to his senses and looked at [Li Feifei], shaking his head wordlessly. The Pontiac ran roaringly along the mountain road.
0:36:10|0:36:23|Driving into the distant towering mountains, the sea surface ripples with light and shadow. Not far from the bay, several fishing boats are anchored. [Wu Lin] stands on the terrace of the villa, hands in pockets, gazing at the sea view.
0:36:23|0:36:37|[Li Feifei] walked up to him in a silk tank top and chiffon skirt, asking,
0:36:48|0:36:58|The cold city is engulfed by the night, with towering buildings shining brightly and dazzling lights reflecting each other.
0:36:58|0:37:18|[Li Jiang] sat in a leather chair smoking a cigar, reminiscing about his experiences after leaving the mountain. He squatted next to a trash can, fighting with a dog for food. With a command from [Fu Tou], his men rushed towards the Li River with axes in hand. However, Li Jiang displayed his martial arts skills and quickly defeated the opponents with just a few simple moves.
0:37:18|0:37:45|[Li Jiang] threw someone into a foam box with an elbow strike, made someone fall heavily in place with a knee jump, then roared and lifted a person to slam him onto a wooden table, which broke instantly. Seeing this, [Fu Tou] got anxious and swung two axes wildly at [Li Jiang]. [Li Jiang] stepped back a few steps, then suddenly locked his neck, followed by a knee strike that flipped him backwards. [Fu Tou] then fiercely hit [Li Jiang]'s face, giving [Li Jiang] the chance to jump to an open space.
0:37:45|0:38:10|[Li Jiang] rushed forward and knocked him down with a cross of his fists. [Fu Tou] struggled to prop himself up in the rain. [Li Jiang] slowly approached him, picked up his axe, and [Fu Tou] closed his eyes resignedly. However, [Li Jiang] threw away the axe. At this moment, a glaring car light shone over, a Mercedes stopped in front of everyone. [Fomian] walked slowly with an umbrella and said to [Li Jiang].
0:38:19|0:38:34|[Fu Tou] and another henchman stood in front of [Li Jiang], trying to persuade him, and [Li Jiang] fell into contemplation.
0:38:34|0:38:43|[Li Feifei] was curious about [Wu Lin]'s shoes. She squatted down and touched the shoes.
0:38:51|0:39:6|Several seagulls skimmed over the water, with [Wu Lin] and [Li Feifei] standing in a shallow pool, practicing martial arts stances. [Li Feifei] imitated the boxing moves like a cat learning from a tiger, while [Wu Lin] helped adjust her posture step by step.
0:39:9|0:39:14|[Wu Lin] lay flat on the deck, while [Li Feifei] used her index finger to check his breathing.
0:39:30|0:39:45|The two of them spent time together by the sea, like newlyweds on their honeymoon. Li Feifei played with sand in her hands, while Wu Lin stood by and watched. Li Feifei taught Wu Lin how to drive, pushing his head away when he couldn't learn properly.
0:39:45|0:40:7|The two sat fishing by the side of the fishing boat, [Wu Lin] caught a white pomfret, and mischievously scared [Li Feifei], who dropped the crab in her hand. In a daze, [Li Feifei] seemed to have returned to her carefree childhood. [Wu Lin] hugged [Li Feifei] and rode a horse on the beach. [Li Feifei] wore a backless dress, her smile as bright as the clear sky. The two drove on the beach.
0:40:7|0:40:23|The wheels rolled up splashing water into the sky, the two ran on the colorful trestle bridge. The bridge extended from the beach into the sea, with two platforms at the end stretching out to the left and right. They stood on the platforms, feeling the lingering sunlight from the setting sun.
0:40:23|0:40:46|Li Feifei's long hair was blowing back in the sea breeze, with a gentle and serene expression. The halo of the setting sun enveloped the sea and fishing boats. Wu Lin and Li Feifei stood at the bow facing the sea breeze. Wu Lin looked around at the sea view, while Li Feifei, in a white dress, leaned against a post behind him. Both were silent, yet this scene was plain and heartwarming, with the spray of water splashing from the bow.
0:40:46|0:40:48|Gathered into a snowy white expanse at the bottom of the ship.
0:40:48|0:41:3|At night, [Li Feifei] sat on the swing chair lost in thought, while [Wu Lin] stood up and approached the bonfire, where the wood had long been deformed by the flames.
0:41:3|0:41:19|In the grand hall, a man in a black suit throws several pieces of paper into the brazier. On a nearby chair rests a dragon-headed cane. [Li Jiang] is being pushed into the hall by [Fu Tou]. He raises his handcuffed hands and points at the chair, speaking.
0:41:19|0:41:25|[Li Jiang] was constantly kicked down by [Fu Tou], and at that moment, he sat in the car at midnight, with the driver wearing a cap looking at the rearview mirror.
0:42:10|0:42:34|[Fomian] noticed [Li Jiang] hesitating, his eyes wandering, still silent. [Wu Lin] stood on a pile of broken stones by the sea, waves rushing towards the shore, crashing against the rocks, leaving behind strings of silvery white foam.
0:42:34|0:42:45|[Wu Lin] recalled what [Li Jiang] said when he chose him back then. That year, [Li Jiang] and Fomian appeared together in the woods behind the back mountain, followed by a group of people.
0:43:36|0:43:59|[Master]'s words struck [Wu Lin]'s heart. He stood on the rocky beach for a long time. In the arena, [Fu Tou] said, "Brother, they were found by the sea." [Li Jiang] stood in the arena smoking a cigar. The bodyguard in front of [Li Jiang] brandished a long knife, twirled it twice, and then swung it towards him.
0:43:59|0:44:11|[Li Jiang] flicked away the cigar in his hand, the blade narrowly missing his throat. He grabbed the bodyguard's arm and delivered a hook punch, causing the opponent to step back several paces, the blade grazing his neck.
0:44:11|0:44:36|Li Jiang landed a punch on the bodyguard's neck, followed by several more punches, causing the opponent to spit wildly. The opponents in front of Li Jiang kept changing, one was hit and sprayed water from the mouth, another was hit with a double punch and flew out of the fighting arena. A henchman standing outside the arena handed a huge shackle to Li Jiang, then stepped back to wait at the edge of the arena. Li Jiang spoke slowly.
0:44:47|0:45:8|On a stormy night, the bodyguards with machetes and masks arrived at the seaside. The lightning illuminated [Jade-faced King Kong] who led the way. The bodyguards approached the villa, where lights were on but the door was wide open. [Jade-faced King Kong] pulled back the curtains and shouted, while [Wu Lin] and [Li Feifei] escaped through the window. The bodyguards also climbed out of the window to chase after them.
0:45:8|0:45:32|[Wu Lin] is running through the jungle holding hands with [Li Feifei]. Several armed bodyguards block their way, [Wu Lin] fights off the approaching bodyguards while still holding [Li Feifei]'s hand. As two bodyguards charge at him, [Wu Lin] uses both hands to knock them down. One of them seizes [Li Feifei] and carries her away, [Wu Lin] swiftly twists the arm of the other bodyguard and kicks his knee, bending it.
0:45:32|0:45:58|[Wu Lin] pressed another person against a tree, twisting the opponent's neck, but he was still grabbed by several people at the legs. [Wu Lin] struck with both fists, causing the two people in front of him to fall down simultaneously. The last bodyguard was also kicked into the mud pit. When [Wu Lin] saw [Li Feifei] being carried away on the shoulders of the black-clothed men, he immediately chased after them. A large area of construction sites and factories was built here. [Wu Lin] followed the black-clothed men to a warehouse, where the lightning's light shone through the crack in the door.
0:45:58|0:46:20|[Wu Lin] was soaked through by the rain, alertly observing the surroundings. The lightning illuminated the lime on the warehouse, flickering. [Wu Lin] took steps inside, where the ground was covered with lime, pure white. [Wu Lin]'s eyes darted around, observing both sides of the warehouse. On the right side, there was a separated Yulu car and abandoned mechanical parts.
0:46:20|0:46:44|[Wu Lin] continued to walk inside, and a pair of feet appeared on the iron frame in the sky. Sensing something unusual, [Wu Lin] stopped and listened intently to the surroundings. It was silent all around, with only occasional thunder from outside. A drop of water fell on [Wu Lin]'s right hand, and he clenched his fist secretly. A man wearing a hammer ring also clenched the iron chain.
0:46:46|0:46:51|[Wu Lin]'s right foot stepped into the trap, and the shackle instantly locked around his ankle.
0:46:51|0:47:11|He squatted down to unlock the shackles, but heard a shout, [Fu Tou] jumped from above to the ground and pounced on [Wu Lin]. [Fu Tou] continuously attacked [Wu Lin] with his double axes, then spun around and threw the axes. [Wu Lin] grabbed the iron chain on the axes and pulled [Fu Tou] towards him, kicking him in the air and making him sit on the ground spitting blood, then the other King Kongs rushed over.
0:47:11|0:47:36|[Wu Lin] was just about to turn around when his hair was sliced off by his sword. [Jade-faced King Kong] swung his long knife towards [Wu Lin], who jumped up with the help of a wooden box and delivered a flying kick to [Jade-faced King Kong]'s head. [Fighting King Kong] quickly joined the fray, with [Wu Lin] blocking his leg and then feinting to make him defend, before kicking him down. [Fu Tou] and the other King Kongs rushed in, but [Wu Lin] managed to fend them off with kicks and hammer strikes, only to be lifted and slammed to the ground by [Fighting King Kong].
0:49:11|0:49:34|[Wu Lin] spun around to resist the attacks, but was unexpectedly grabbed by [Giant King Kong] and thrown into a wooden box nearby, which was smashed to pieces by him. Without giving [Wu Lin] a chance to catch his breath, [Giant King Kong] dragged him to the open space in the middle, where [Cold-blooded King Kong] attempted to stab [Wu Lin] with a knife, only to be kicked away by [Wu Lin]. Immediately, [Fighting King Kong] and [Iron-head King Kong] seized [Wu Lin] by his legs.
0:49:34|0:49:42|[Fighting King Kong] took the other shackle and locked it around his left foot, [Wu Lin] immediately lost the advantage and was suspended and beaten by the two of them.
0:49:42|0:50:7|Giant King Kong kicks Wu Lin, sending him flying with his face down on the ground. Smiling King Kong rushes in with a knife, but Wu Lin grabs the handle and punches him in the chest. Wu Lin then throws a right hook at Smiling King Kong, causing him to spit blood and collapse. Iron-head King Kong charges at Wu Lin, who twists his neck and delivers several heavy punches followed by an elbow and knee strike.
0:50:7|0:50:9|Iron-head King Kong also fell to the ground and couldn't get up.
0:50:11|0:50:38|[Wu Lin], with a sturdy head, took a kick from [Fighting King Kong], staggering a few steps outward. Before he could react, he was hit with a punch to the side of his face, causing instant ringing in his ears. In a daze, [Wu Lin] managed to block the continuous punches and kicks from [Fighting King Kong]. [Fighting King Kong] then lifted him up and swung him behind. [Wu Lin] spun in the air before being thrown back to the ground.
0:50:38|0:51:0|[Wu Lin] opened his eyes and prepared to get up, only to see a shocking scene. His eyes widened as he saw [Li Feifei] being tied up with a hemp rope, her hands hanging in the air. [Wu Lin] struggled to get up and stared at [Li Feifei]. The frail [Li Feifei] had her mouth gagged with a cloth and was struggling in pain in the air. [Wu Lin] shouted at her, completely unaware.
0:51:0|0:51:1|This is a trap.
0:51:1|0:51:17|[Giant King Kong] walked up to [Wu Lin], slapped him on the back of the head with one hand, and [Wu Lin] instantly crashed to the ground, howling in pain. [Giant King Kong] then lifted him up with both hands, turned him in a different direction, and threw him onto a giant tire.
0:51:17|0:51:27|[Wu Lin] was just lying on the ground when [Fu Tou] swung his twin axes and rushed towards him, wildly chopping and hacking away.
0:51:27|0:51:49|[Wu Lin] jumped in place, kicking [Fu Tou] away. [Fu Tou] crashed through the windshield and fell into the driver's seat. [Wu Lin] rushed towards [Fighting King Kong], raining punches on his chest. Ignoring the shackles on his feet, [Wu Lin] repeatedly lifted his knee to attack [Fighting King Kong]'s abdomen, then jumped in place and used his knee to knock out [Fighting King Kong]'s head. Immediately after, he punched towards his right face.
0:51:49|0:51:56|The opponent fell to the ground, and Cold-blooded King Kong emerged and swung his bayonet towards Wu Lin's upper body, but ended up stabbing Wu Lin's ankle chain.
0:51:56|0:52:22|Cold-blooded King Kong took the opportunity to kick him down, Giant King Kong stepped forward, lifted Wu Lin with his shackles, Fu Tou sat on the main frame of the car, threw the axe aside, Giant King Kong swung Wu Lin in a half circle onto the speeding car, Wu Lin lay on the hood of the car, Fu Tou stepped on the gas pedal, rushed towards the cement wall of the warehouse with a suicidal momentum, Li Feifei shook her head in despair.
0:52:25|0:52:46|The car carrying [Wu Lin] crashed through the wall, [Fu Tou] slammed on the brakes, and [Wu Lin] rolled off the hood. Outdoors, flashes of light flickered, thunder still rumbling, large raindrops hitting [Wu Lin]. He curled up in pain, [Cold-blooded King Kong] squeezed his face, inspected it, then handed him over to [Giant King Kong]. [Giant King Kong] picked up [Wu Lin]'s shackles.
0:52:46|0:52:59|Dragging him out of the factory, [Cold-blooded King Kong] and [Fu Tou] followed closely behind. [Wu Lin] was dragged across the grass by [Giant King Kong], his arms limp at his sides, his mouth opening and closing as if conscious yet at the mercy of others.
0:52:59|0:53:9|[Giant King Kong] dragged him forward without any emotion, [Fu Tou] followed with a look of disgust on his face, the rain poured down heavily, raindrops hitting [Wu Lin]'s face.
0:53:9|0:53:41|Giant King Kong suddenly released [Wu Lin]. [Wu Lin] tightly closed his eyes, tilted his head to one side, and painfully bent his legs. Under his feet was a deep pit big enough to bury ten people, with a dozen black-clad men holding shovels and hoes standing by. [Wu Lin] struggled to climb up from the muddy ground. [Li Feifei] was held in a lock by Cold-blooded King Kong, who opened a large black umbrella in front of him, under which was [Li Jiang]. [Wu Lin] was drenched in the pouring rain, trembling as he stood up.
0:53:41|0:53:59|Knocked down by a shovel from the person on the right, he stood up again only to be hit in the back by [Fu Tou] on the right, falling to the ground. [Li Jiang] silently smoked a cigar.
0:53:59|0:54:6|[Fu Tou] raised the iron shovel high and slammed it on [Wu Lin]'s back. [Wu Lin] howled in pain and fell face down into the mud.
0:54:6|0:54:10|[Li Jiang] slowly closed his eyes, recalling the days of martial arts training with [Wu Lin].
0:54:10|0:54:22|[Li Jiang] was practicing handstands in the courtyard, while [Wu Lin] took advantage of [Master] napping, secretly breaking off pieces of steamed buns to feed him. [Li Jiang] was expelled from the sect, carrying his luggage, he said to [Wu Lin],
0:54:25|0:54:50|I will definitely come back to pick you up and [Master]. The two embraced tightly in the pouring rain, [Li Jiang] opened his eyes to see the torrential rain just like that night, but in front of him, [Wu Lin] was covered in blood. He stared hard at [Li Jiang] through the wet hair, struggling to prop himself up from the ground, lifting one leg. [Li Jiang] walked towards [Wu Lin], gesturing for the bodyguard holding the umbrella to stay put, and then threw away the cigar in his hand.
0:54:50|0:54:55|[Wu Lin] staggered to his feet, blood and saliva mixed at the corner of his mouth.
0:54:55|0:55:16|[Li Jiang] walked into the rain, staring at [Wu Lin] intently. [Wu Lin] also looked at him, his chest heaving violently in the flashing white light. The area under [Li Jiang]'s eyes turned dark, and he approached [Wu Lin] like a fierce jackal. [Wu Lin] looked up at [Li Jiang], blood streaming down his forehead and left eye uncontrollably.
0:55:16|0:55:34|[Li Jiang] stared into [Wu Lin]'s eyes and suddenly became fierce. His fists smashed towards [Wu Lin]'s chest, causing him to fly backwards. [Wu Lin] looked at [Li Jiang] in disbelief, while shock spread in [Li Feifei]'s eyes in an instant.
0:55:36|0:56:1|[Wu Lin] fell backwards into the deep pit, with lightning illuminating [Li Jiang]'s face. He looked down at the pit without any emotion, while [Li Feifei] collapsed in despair. [Cold-blooded King Kong] held him tightly, as the man in black shoveled sand from the edge of the pit into it. [Li Jiang] slowly knelt beside the pit, watching as [Wu Lin] was covered by the sand. He couldn't bear to keep his eyes open.
0:56:4|0:56:36|Sand covered [Wu Lin]'s body, making his appearance and clothing indistinguishable. [Li Jiang] looked down at the pit again, where clay had plastered [Wu Lin]'s face. The rain pounded on his sandy body, causing him to lose consciousness. In the cold city, the financial center shone like a galaxy, being washed by the torrential rain. Dark clouds, accompanied by fierce winds and rain, suddenly flashed with lightning. Several white lights shot out from the dark night.
0:56:38|0:56:44|With lightning speed, Wu Lin swiftly cuts through the dark night and plunges into the thick black clouds.
0:56:44|0:56:51|The fierce tiger in the iron cage suddenly looked towards the window, while [Fomian] sitting on the throne in the hall still leaned on the dragon-headed cane.
0:56:54|0:57:10|The rain poured down outside, making the tiger in the cage restless. It paced and leaped around the cage as if its life was being threatened. [Fomian] calmly smoked a cigarette, seemingly in complete control of the situation.
0:57:10|0:57:20|[Wu Lin] seemed to be immersed in a clear pool of water, while a haze rose from the brim of [Fomian]'s hat.
0:57:25|0:57:50|In the blink of an eye, [Fomian] had already stood up sideways, tilting his head to exhale smoke. He walked to the iron cage with a cane, and the tiger rose to follow his steps. [Wu Lin], soaked in water, blew a bubble, and the rain-soaked ground suddenly loosened. [Fomian] paced back and forth by the iron cage, while the tiger inside sat down, exhaling a gust of wind with its mouth wide open.
0:57:51|0:58:1|[Wu Lin] swayed his head in the water, like a fierce tiger in a cage, suddenly widening his eyes as if sensing a life undergoing transformation and rebirth.
0:58:2|0:58:30|[Wu Lin] opened his eyes in the water, a thunderbolt struck down, an iron shoe kicked through the layers of soil and emerged from the ground, the tiger in the iron cage was shot and fell to the ground, [Fomian] slowly put down the gun in his hand, the sky seemed to be torn apart, thunder rolled, lightning surged, a hand reached out from the mud pit and clung tightly to the ground, the rain did not stop, [Wu Lin] climbed up the ground along the edge of the pit.
0:58:30|0:58:44|His whole body was wrapped in black mud, with only half of his mouth visible and his white teeth showing, [Wu Lin] supported his body with his arms, one leg propped on the edge of the pit, and the other leg lifted up from the pit.
0:58:45|0:59:10|[Wu Lin] crawled slowly out of the pit like a molting giant lizard, with the heavy shackles still hanging on his feet. [Wu Lin] half-knelt with one foot on the ground, his left hand resting on his knee, clenched his fist secretly. He pushed the ground with his right hand, but couldn't stand up. Fortunately, he used it to support the ground, allowing his right leg to also step on the ground.
0:59:10|0:59:34|[Wu Lin] was being pelted by the rain, with large and small chunks of mud falling off his body. His leather coat, which he always wore, was now soaked in mud, losing its original luster. His cheeks were also covered in black mud, resembling a motionless statue. He raised both hands high, looking up and shouting.
0:59:54|1:0:25|In a torrential rainstorm with flashing lightning, [Wu Lin] clenches his fist and raises it into the air. A bolt of lightning splits the sky, illuminating the night as bright as day. With wet hair and blood at the corner of his mouth, [Wu Lin] searches through [Li Jiashan]'s desk. He picks up a certificate, flips through it, then puts it back. He finds a transparent disc in a box, which contains a video clip.
1:1:3|1:1:33|[Wu Lin] saw countless faces flash before his eyes. He clenched his teeth, closed his eyes tightly, and hammered the iron shoes on the ground. A crack appeared at the shoe's vamp. Putting down the hammer, [Wu Lin] grimaced as he pried open the iron piece on the shoe, his foot tightly wrapped in strips of cloth, the whole foot soaked black with mud. [Wu Lin] grabbed his ankle, laboriously pulling out his foot from the iron shoe, the tip of his foot emerging from the layers of cloth strips, as if blood was about to seep out.
1:1:33|1:1:57|In the sink, a row of short hair fell down, [Wu Lin] personally cut the hair behind the neck, [Li Jiang] opened the box in front of him and found a pair of iron gloves inside. After the iron shoes in the room were cleaned and placed on the table against the wall in the entrance, suddenly the iron shoes crushed the tabletop.
1:2:1|1:2:12|The rivers and waves rolled, the sky changed, and the rising sun burst out from the billowing clouds, illuminating the entire city with dazzling light, making everything shine.
1:2:12|1:2:19|The Golden Gate of the bodyguard group suddenly heard a series of door-kicking sounds, the room inside was dark and empty.
1:2:27|1:2:40|Two King Kong gates collapsed one after another, raising a cloud of dust. [Wu Lin] clenched his fists and walked in. He looked sharp and capable after cutting his short hair, with polarized sunglasses covering his eyes, giving him a steady and cool demeanor.
1:2:40|1:3:5|[Wu Lin] strode into the corridor, stepping on the door panels. He was dressed in a high-quality suit and wore a pair of pointed leather shoes. Expressionless, [Wu Lin] walked towards the end of the corridor where the wall with a tiger head emblem was shining brightly, seemingly warning silently. He turned into the security checkpoint at the entrance without hesitation and walked under the laser array. [Wu Lin] paused for a long time in place, but this time the alarm did not sound.
1:3:6|1:3:35|The warning lights above the laser array silently flickered, [Wu Lin] walked along the safety line towards the training ground, his figure gradually disappearing into the darkness. After entering the training ground, [Wu Lin] stood still, and suddenly the overhead lights turned on. [Wu Lin] slowly took off his sunglasses, the light source above his head hiding his face in the shadows. He put the sunglasses into his shirt pocket and stared straight ahead, as the lights in the training ground lit up one by one.
1:3:35|1:3:57|Lurking in the darkness, the bodyguards revealed themselves, fully armed and lined up neatly in the open space. Most of them held sticks, while only the bodyguards in the front three rows were bare-handed. [Wu Lin] stood in front of this group of people with a serious expression, facing them quietly. Suddenly, the bodyguards started to throw punches and kicks.
1:4:0|1:4:29|[Wu Lin] bent forward and charged a few steps, facing over a hundred burly bodyguards who were now ferocious and charging towards [Wu Lin] like mad. [Wu Lin] jumped with one foot, spun in the air, and then kicked the bodyguard in the middle of the front row, sending him flying 10 meters away with tremendous force. The impact caused him to knock down a pile of people behind him. [Wu Lin] grabbed one person by the neck, executed a beautiful spinning kick in mid-air, hitting the person squarely in the face, and then landed steadily.
1:4:29|1:4:36|Surrounded by bodyguards, Wu Lin quickly performed a low sweep kick and knocked down a group in front of him.
1:4:36|1:4:42|[Wu Lin] kicked two people in a row, attracting a group of knife-wielding bodyguards who attacked him relentlessly.
1:4:42|1:5:7|[Wu Lin] stood up and grabbed the hand of one person holding a knife, pressing down on his back to jump into the air. After landing, [Wu Lin] quickly got up and kicked away the iron rods in the hands of several people. He swept up the stairs with one leg after another, kicking straight and sideways. The bodyguards who rushed up fell down one after another. Suddenly, a bodyguard holding an iron rod rushed forward and hit [Wu Lin] solidly on the back of his head.
1:5:7|1:5:18|Several iron rods came crashing down towards him, he blocked them with his elbows, his feet springing up one after another, his whirlwind kicks sweeping around, knocking down a circle of people with a flying kick.
1:5:19|1:5:28|[Wu Lin] continues to exert force, kicking one person down after another, attempting to get close to his bodyguards. The first wave of people all fall down, and the second layer of encirclement quickly closes in.
1:5:28|1:5:54|[Wu Lin], with sharp eyes like knives, kicked and sent flying the young man who rushed forward. Using both legs, he pushed away the two people in front of him, then performed a somersault to kick down the two people behind him. [Wu Lin] kicked another person's chin, sending him soaring into the air, spinning several times before crashing heavily to the ground. Two bodyguards swung their clubs towards him, but [Wu Lin] stepped on one person's chest, flipped in mid-air, and then kicked another person squarely in the face.
1:5:54|1:6:15|In the third wave of bodyguards flanking, [Wu Lin] seemed to activate instant movement and stepped on one person's leg with an arrow step. [Wu Lin] swiftly stepped on each person's calf or foot within the encirclement, causing the hit bodyguards to kneel down one after another. The last person took a hard kick and flew out directly, smashing through the brick wall of the training ground.
1:6:15|1:6:25|[Wu Lin] landed a heavy punch, looking around at the surrounding bodyguards with anger in his eyes. The bodyguards, having witnessed his power, were quite wary and retreated closely from each other.
1:6:25|1:6:49|Soon, another group of people with riot shields rushed out, forming a circle and binding [Wu Lin] in the middle. [Wu Lin] assumed a defensive stance, his eyes suddenly fierce. He kicked one of the guys along with the shield several meters away. The riot shield circle tightened immediately. As [Wu Lin] raised his hand to block, two men with knives charged towards him, stabbing directly at his abdomen.
1:6:49|1:7:11|[Wu Lin] grabbed the hand holding the knife and twisted it outward, causing both of them to fall heavily to the ground. [Wu Lin] then executed a flying kick in mid-air, stepping on the closely arranged riot shields around him, breaking up half of the encirclement. A row of riot shields rushed forward, but [Wu Lin] was hit by an offensive iron shield and sent flying. He quickly got up and tried to escape backwards, only to jump into the fighting arena enclosed by iron chains.
1:7:11|1:7:20|A person rushed in through the open iron gate, only to be kicked back by [Wu Lin] and forced to retreat, while several others climbed in by stepping on iron chains from the fence.
1:7:20|1:7:50|[Wu Lin] turned his head and exerted force continuously, his legs landing on the necks, waists, and chests of the approaching individuals, causing them to fall down one by one. At this moment, the riot shield team also rushed into the arena. [Wu Lin] stepped on the railing, suspended in the air and kicked down towards the back of a person's neck. Upon landing, he delivered a side kick, kicking the bodyguard who rushed in through the iron gate out of the arena. [Wu Lin] kept exerting force, kicking the face of a young man swinging a bat. Nearly 10 bodyguards holding riot shields and iron rods rushed towards him.
1:7:50|1:8:14|[Wu Lin] turned around and kicked a riot shield, bending it in half. Five or six iron shields were instantly scrapped, and the bodyguards with protective gear vomited blood and fell to the ground one by one. [Wu Lin] leaped into the air, legs together in a spinning kick. The three people hit by the kick were pushed back by the shockwave and crashed into the fence of the fighting arena. [Wu Lin] was in a state of extreme excitement, bordering on madness.
1:8:14|1:8:41|With an evil grin on his face, feeling the joy of battle, he suddenly turned around to look at the bodyguards behind him, [Wu Lin] shouted loudly, as if sounding the charge, those few people rushed towards him as if fighting to the death, [Wu Lin] let out a roar, like a tiger showing its might, causing the base of the mountain to kick up a bent explosion-proof shield spinning into the air, beads of sweat dripping from [Wu Lin]'s temples, he slowly raised his head,
1:8:41|1:9:5|Lying around him were the constantly wailing bodyguards, crisscrossing and covering the ground of the fighting arena. [Wu Lin] half-knelt among these people, calmly stood up and walked off the arena. Under the three steps outside the arena, bodyguards were still rolling in pain. [Wu Lin] stood under the steps for a few seconds, took big strides and left the training ground.
1:9:5|1:9:11|The field that was just occupied by a hundred bodyguards is now filled with the wounded and dying remnants.
1:9:12|1:9:35|In front of the Tiger Head Mechanical Gate stood a bodyguard holding a samurai sword. He was tall and had thick eyebrows and big eyes. He was none other than Jade-faced King Kong among the Eight King Kongs. In no time, Wu Lin unlocked the mechanical door lock with his fingers. Jade-faced King Kong was already unconscious and covered in blood. Wu Lin walked into the door, and the mechanical door closed automatically behind him.
1:9:37|1:10:6|He took a few steps forward, facing Cold-blooded King Kong sitting on the coffee table in front of him, with Fu Tou sitting next to the desk on her left. The heavy footsteps behind him were from Giant King Kong, clenching his fists tightly and staring at [Wu Lin]. The cold-blooded female King Kong made the first move, but was kicked to the wall by [Wu Lin], spitting out a mouthful of blood on the ground. Fu Tou and Giant King Kong beside them gritted their teeth, with Giant King Kong roaring and smashing a fist towards [Wu Lin].
1:10:6|1:10:9|Being kicked in the fist and knees by him in return.
1:10:9|1:10:36|Following, [Wu Lin] grabbed the hair on [Giant King Kong]'s forehead and inserted two fingers below his Adam's apple. As [Wu Lin] glanced to the right, [Fu Tou] flew up with a kick, hitting the iron display screen on the table. After dodging a few moves, [Wu Lin] raised both hands to catch the next blade, but also kicked [Fu Tou] out. [Fu Tou] propped himself up defiantly, climbing up from the ground with blood dripping from the corner of his mouth.
1:10:36|1:10:42|[Fu Tou] flew towards [Wu Lin], but got caught on [Wu Lin]'s raised leg.
1:10:42|1:11:13|[Wu Lin] once again acted ruthlessly, [Fu Tou] was thrown onto the wooden stake for training. [Wu Lin] walked up to the fallen [Fu Tou], squatted down and looked into his eyes for a while. Suddenly, [Wu Lin]'s eyelids lifted, and he arrived at a quaint iron gate. The gate opened automatically to both sides, and as [Wu Lin] entered, it slowly closed behind him. [Wu Lin] suddenly stopped in his tracks, [Li Feifei] and [Li Jiang] were locked in an iron cage.
1:11:27|1:11:34|[Fomian] furrowed his brow, stood up with his dragon-headed cane, and walked from the shadows to a place with side lighting.
1:11:37|1:11:45|[Fomian] twitched his eyebrows, and [Wu Lin] pulled up the sleeve of his left hand.
1:11:56|1:12:3|[Li Jiang] looked at [Wu Lin] and remembered the past. He comforted his wife by kissing the back of her hand in the car.
1:12:55|1:13:13|[Li Jiang] and [Fomian] hurriedly ran to the back mountain forest, where young [Wu Lin] was standing in front of [Li Feifei], facing off against a vicious wolf. [Fomian] looked on in horror as the wolf glanced at [Wu Lin], who stared back with a determined yet innocent gaze. The wolf began to retreat under his unwavering stare.
1:13:14|1:13:21|The evil wolf suddenly turned and fled.
1:13:58|1:14:16|At the edge of the cliff, [Fomian] released his grip on [Wu Lin]'s raised hands, causing [Wu Lin] to plummet down the cliff. Now, as [Fomian] sees [Wu Lin] again, he chuckles sinisterly.
1:14:33|1:14:40|[Fomian] sat back on the dragon throne, laughing heartily.
1:15:7|1:15:18|[Wu Lin] had sweat dripping down his face as [Bamian Shaxing] aimed a gun at him. [Wu Lin] stared fearlessly at the barrel.
1:15:20|1:15:25|Bamian Shaxing pulled the trigger, but was blocked by Li Jiang's iron fist. Li Jiang let go of his hand.
1:16:8|1:16:39|[Li Jiang] raised his right fist, but it was a left punch aimed straight at [Wu Lin]'s face. After taking a punch to the abdomen from [Li Jiang], [Wu Lin] slid back and quickly kicked back at [Li Jiang], using an iron fist to support the ground and stand firm. [Wu Lin] immediately rushed forward, unleashing a spiral kick that kicked [Li Jiang] to the wall. Then, lifting his foot, he unexpectedly kicked off the armrest of the nearby iron chair. [Li Jiang] threw a punch, but [Wu Lin] dodged it, smashing through the tabletop of the iron tea table. He lifted the tabletop and swung it towards [Wu Lin].
1:16:39|1:16:51|When [Wu Lin] was immediately kicked into pieces, [Wu Lin] made a sliding move, wrapping his legs around [Li Jiang]'s leg, [Li Jiang] flipped over and grabbed [Wu Lin]'s foot, swinging him into the air and slamming him heavily onto the iron floor.
1:16:51|1:17:2|[Wu Lin] glanced back at [Li Jiang], then clamped his legs around his waist, spun and threw him off, followed by a swift spinning roundhouse kick that sent [Li Jiang] crashing into the wall.
1:17:4|1:17:11|Li Jiang stood up with his hands pounding the ground, then turned to face Wu Lin. A sly smile appeared on the aged face of Fomian.
1:17:11|1:17:19|[Li Jiang] launched a heavy punch, smashing a iron stake towards [Wu Lin], then followed up with a right hook hitting his cheek.
1:17:19|1:17:31|[Wu Lin] didn't suffer at all, a spinning kick knocked [Li Jiang] unconscious, then a fierce stomp accidentally broke through a brick wall. [Li Jiang] tried all his moves to strike at [Wu Lin], but ended up hitting the wall behind him.
1:17:31|1:17:56|[Wu Lin] kicked [Li Jiang] away, both of them spitting blood, fighting fiercely. [Li Jiang] countered by grabbing [Wu Lin]'s left arm and forcefully pushing him into a hole in the wall. [Wu Lin] hooked [Li Jiang]'s leg with his foot, jumping back and slamming him onto the iron floor. Rolling to the side, [Wu Lin] then kicked [Li Jiang] in the abdomen, causing him to scream in pain as he crashed into the iron mannequin, with his feet landing crazily on [Li Jiang]'s elbow and shoulder.
1:17:56|1:18:22|[Wu Lin] grabbed [Li Jiang]'s fist, kicked into his left chest, all the bones in [Li Jiang]'s left chest shattered, his face turned red, his left cheek twitched violently, [Wu Lin] released his hand, he seemed to lose support, clutching his left shoulder and falling backwards, [Wu Lin] then swept towards [Li Jiang]'s left leg, his shin bone broke with a snap, [Li Jiang] fell to the ground and muttered to himself,
1:18:26|1:19:2|[Wu Lin]'s eyes revealed a hint of pity, [Li Jiang] buried his head in tears, years of grievances and unwillingness finally erupted. [Fomian] sat indifferently on the golden chair, [Bamian Shaxing] hit [Li Jiang]'s chest. [Wu Lin] quickly grabbed [Li Jiang]'s arm to steady his body, glaring angrily at [Fomian]. Blood flowed from [Li Jiang]'s mouth as he looked at [Wu Lin] indignantly and said,
1:19:11|1:19:41|[Wu Lin] silently grasped [Li Jiang]'s hand with the full set, he half helped [Li Jiang] up, [Li Jiang] stared straight at [Fomian], no ripple in [Fomian]'s eyes, [Li Jiang]'s eyes twitched, seemingly endless resentment towards [Fomian], he suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood, [Wu Lin] endured the pain and laid him flat on the ground, then stood up, baring his teeth fiercely at [Fomian],
1:19:58|1:20:11|[Wu Lin] clenched his fist tightly, then suddenly turned towards [Bamian Shaxing]. The opponent quickly raised his gun and shot a bullet through [Wu Lin]'s left chest, causing a stream of blood to spurt out from his back.
1:20:13|1:20:36|[Wu Lin] closed his eyes and fell backwards, [Bamian Shaxing] looked a bit flustered, [Li Feifei] despairingly covered her mouth in the iron cage, [Bamian Shaxing] squatted beside [Wu Lin], turning his head to look at [Fomian] for help. [Wu Lin]'s shirt was already soaked in blood, [Bamian Shaxing] slowly moved closer to his face.
1:20:39|1:21:3|[Wu Lin] suddenly opened his eyes and kicked him onto the iron chair against the wall. [Wu Lin] covered his left chest, stood up, and mockingly looked at [Fomian], with thick blood still lingering at the corner of his mouth. Like an immortal monster, he slowly walked up the steps, approaching [Fomian] step by step. [Fomian] fell back into the golden chair, and [Wu Lin] approached him, grabbing his neck.
1:21:3|1:21:10|[Wu Lin] raises his right hand and extends two fingers.
1:21:27|1:21:36|[Wu Lin] twisted his head in pain, and then [Fomian] continued,
1:21:39|1:22:20|[Wu Lin] raised his hand again, but he couldn't bring himself to strike. Trembling, he slowly lowered his clenched fist. Gritting his teeth, [Wu Lin] suppressed the bitterness and anguish in his heart as he looked at [Fomian] and said,
1:22:21|1:22:30|[Wu Lin] suddenly grinned, staggered and turned to walk down the steps, dropping a gold chain and iron lock on the ground.
1:22:52|1:23:8|Middle-aged Fomian slowly raised his head, looking at the fortune teller with a smile that was not quite a smile. As time passed and the situation changed, Li Feifei placed a white chrysanthemum in front of the tombstone.
1:23:19|1:23:35|[Li Feifei]'s graceful profile, even more charming in the light of the sky, with a dense cluster of cherry blossoms overlapping on the cliff edge. [Wu Lin] stands at the edge of the cliff, holding an urn in his left hand.
