0:3:4|0:3:12|After speaking, Xiaotian turned and ran, with [Liu Jinxi] angrily chasing after him. Outside the cowshed, in the kitchen, the woman packed the sliced bamboo shoots into a plate.
0:3:13|0:3:20|He then carried it towards the direction of the house. At this moment, the two brothers ran down from the second floor.
0:3:39|0:3:48|The man with braids pulled out Xiaotian's tooth with his hand, and then, stored it in a jar. The scene then shifted,
0:3:48|0:4:0|Four people are sitting around the table eating. The woman picked up a bowl of porridge from the table, and Xiaotian, who had just lost a tooth, kept touching his gums while drinking the porridge.
0:4:21|0:4:28|The older brother took a sip of porridge, then looked up and asked the woman.
0:4:34|0:4:38|Xiaotian smiled and patted the table, saying to his brother. After finishing the meal,
0:4:38|0:4:51|The man with braids put the cowhide cloth wrapped with a file into the bamboo basket, picked up his straw hat, and walked out of the bamboo house. The cow on the outdoor platform on the second floor let out a couple of low moos, as if saying goodbye to him.
0:4:51|0:4:59|Leaving home, Liu Jinxi walked through the bamboo forest, crossed the grassland, passed a small bridge, and arrived at a meadow.
0:4:59|0:5:10|He first crushed the straw with a bamboo pole, then placed it on a stone slab, and stood on a wooden stake, striking the straw up and down.
0:5:10|0:5:19|There are five or six more people. When the straw is almost beaten, someone will spread it out on the bamboo screen and sift it in the water.
0:5:19|0:5:22|Later, it was scooped out and dried to make paper.
0:5:41|0:5:49|[Liu Jinxi] used a file to scrape off the wood shavings on the window, then wiped it with his hand before gently pasting the paper on.
0:5:49|0:6:10|At this moment, Liu Jinxi and Xu Baijiu walked into the village with powerful strides. Both of them had a bag slung over their shoulders, with a handle-wrapped item inside. The children were not afraid of these two strangers and circled around them. They then entered a shop.
0:6:24|0:6:30|The waiter responded to the short man. The shop owner asked the two of them.
0:6:33|0:6:39|The two sitting by the window did not respond to the boss's words, so the boss spoke again.
0:6:49|0:6:56|The shop owner joked around with a smile at the counter.
0:6:56|0:7:2|The two of them still ignored him.
0:7:17|0:7:24|The waiter pointed in the direction across the street for Liu Jinxi.
0:7:40|0:7:42|The door that was originally open was closed by the short man.
0:7:42|0:7:47|The shopkeeper quickly put the silver on the table into his pocket when he saw this.
0:7:47|0:8:1|Liu Jinxi quietly picked up the stick from the counter and smashed it towards A Yu. The elderly shopkeeper was frail, and A Yu directly took the stick away. The man with short hair also kicked away the shop assistant who came to help.
0:8:6|0:8:13|The boss lady saw the shopkeeper being kicked hard by the short man, and hurried over to beg for mercy, but was directly grabbed by the hair by the short man.
0:8:13|0:8:17|Pushed towards the other end of the counter. No silver was found.
0:8:17|0:8:24|The man with short hair used a bamboo basket to knock down the pole supporting the window, then returned to the counter and kicked the shopkeeper fiercely.
0:8:24|0:8:32|The short man then pulled out the long knife behind him and waved it from left to right to intimidate the innkeeper.
0:8:33|0:8:40|Just as the man with short hair was about to kick the head of the shopkeeper again, [Liu Jinxi], who was hiding in the dark, took a deep breath and rushed out.
0:8:40|0:8:51|After realizing he was being held around the waist, the short-haired man elbowed Liu Jinxi's back fiercely. Seeing Liu Jinxi still not letting go, the short man raised his knife and swung it towards him.
0:8:51|0:8:56|But [Liu Jinxi] flipped upside down, kicked off the ground with force, and narrowly avoided hitting the ceiling.
0:8:58|0:9:6|The short-haired man who was mistakenly injured threw [Liu Jinxi] out by grabbing his waist directly, while the short man with a knife looked for an opportunity.
0:9:9|0:9:37|At this moment, [Liu Jinxi] once again embraced the short-haired man's waist and took a few steps, then was lifted by the short-haired man and slammed hard against the counter. The short man even wielded a knife towards him, but [Liu Jinxi] always managed to cleverly dodge before being struck. Bending over, he dragged the short-haired man to the window, but exerted too much force and ended up banging his forehead hard against the door frame. Seizing the opportunity, the short-haired man ruthlessly kneed [Liu Jinxi] in the stomach, then proceeded to elbow his back.
0:9:37|0:9:51|On the other side, the short man struggled to pull out the big knife stuck in the counter for a while, then he turned around and drew another knife, slashing horizontally towards [Liu Jinxi]. Helpless, [Liu Jinxi] lowered his body, causing the blade to cut off the left ear of the short-haired man.
0:9:51|0:10:4|Seeing the short man running towards him with a knife, the man with short hair screamed and then a swift kick sent him flying. Then, grabbing [Liu Jinxi] by the collar, he viciously threw him into the counter.
0:10:5|0:10:11|The shock caused the windows of the cabinet to close completely, and the villagers outside were scared and quickly left.
0:10:11|0:10:18|At this moment, seeing the short-haired man approaching again, [Liu Jinxi] quickly crawled towards the depths of the counter.
0:10:18|0:10:23|The short man leaped high with a knife in hand, clearing the counter and heading straight for [Liu Jinxi].
0:10:24|0:10:33|Just as the blade was about to pierce Liu Jinxi's body, the short man's head fiercely slammed into the cabinet edge. Seeing the short man die on the spot,
0:10:33|0:10:41|The man with short hair looked down at Liu Jinxi lying on the ground, then glanced at the knife. At this moment, he heard the sound of the fight stop.
0:10:41|0:10:54|The landlady hurriedly crawled towards the door, just as she was about to carefully stand up by holding onto the cabinet, she saw [Liu Jinxi] and the man with short hair struggling and pushing open the door. Soon after, the two of them fell into a shallow pond together.
0:10:54|0:10:57|The students in class next to them looked over.
0:10:58|0:11:7|Liu Jinxi's eldest son called out to him anxiously. At that moment, in the pond filled with water grass, the man with short hair kept smashing Liu Jinxi's head under the water, fist by fist.
0:11:7|0:11:25|[Liu Jinxi], after swallowing several times, continuously swung his fists towards the man with short hair. When one of the punches landed on the left side of the man's face, he suddenly froze, then staggered backwards and fell. At this moment, [Liu Jinxi] quickly walked from the pond towards the shore.
0:11:34|0:11:41|Seeing [Liu Jinxi] lying weakly on the shore, his eldest son quickly squatted down and touched him.
0:11:41|0:11:49|The man with short hair lay on the pond with his eyes open, drifting away slowly with the flowing water. If you look closely,
0:11:49|0:11:53|His left eye has completely turned black.
0:11:53|0:11:58|At this moment, a person lit a stick of incense and took out a small iron rod.
0:12:2|0:12:8|He turned out to be Liu Jinxi, who was examining the body.
0:12:14|0:12:22|Liu Jinxi's eldest son Fangzheng was interrupted by the police while kicking the corpse.
0:12:29|0:12:38|The young man walked while covering his mouth and nose with a handkerchief, then carefully stared at the two bodies after putting down his umbrella.
0:12:40|0:12:52|In the tavern, the waiter brought a plate of scallions, which the boss took and handed to the adult. The adult picked up two pieces and stuffed them into his mouth.
0:13:4|0:13:18|At this moment, Liu Jinxi squatted down beside the swollen corpse and began poking it with a small iron rod. Suddenly, he noticed a line tattooed below the right ear of the deceased, which read "Criminal Yan Dongsheng." Upon seeing this, Liu Jinxi widened his eyes in shock.
0:15:30|0:15:36|At this moment, [Xu Baijiu] tore open the seal and entered the cabinet, which remained exactly as it was at the time of the incident.
0:15:40|0:15:50|[Xu Baijiu] walked in from the main entrance, then approached the counter. While looking around, he suddenly noticed a small hole in a glass bottle of medicinal wine on the counter.
0:15:50|0:16:4|With doubts in his heart, he quickly discovered something at the bottom of the bottle. He then reached into the bottle and took out a tooth from below, examining it in front of his eyes. [Xu Baijiu] fell into contemplation.
0:16:6|0:16:15|After watching the cabinet, [Xu Baijiu] came to the edge of the pond, looking at the pond full of water plants.
0:16:15|0:16:24|He hurried towards the center. Soon he found the spot where [Yan Dongsheng] had choked to death, recalling the scene of the autopsy.
0:16:24|0:16:27|The eyes of the corpse all turned black.
0:16:27|0:16:36|The surroundings were filled with bloodshot eyes. So, [Xu Baijiu] scooped up a handful of water from the waist-high pond, took a sip, and then scooped up another handful.
0:16:36|0:16:42|Spitting it out, [Xu Baijiu] gazed at the calm and clear pond, lost in thought.
0:17:28|0:17:34|After getting this information from the innkeeper, [Xu Baijiu] went to the morgue.
0:17:34|0:17:46|After driving away the annoying flies, he lifted the cloth covering [Yan Dongsheng] and then picked up the kerosene lamp hanging on the wall and placed it next to [Yan Dongsheng]'s head. At this moment, something was found in [Yan Dongsheng]'s open mouth.
0:17:46|0:17:52|He is missing a tooth, and his eyes are bloodshot.
0:19:5|0:19:12|In the memory, Liu Jinxi came to the tavern. After sitting down, he saw something resembling small balls on the table.
0:19:44|0:19:50|[Xu Baijiu] rubbed his chin and pondered for a moment,
0:19:50|0:19:56|Later, he picked up a glass of wine from the table and drank it. At night, in the bathroom of Liu Jinxi's home,
0:19:56|0:20:5|A person is cleaning the fish maw in the basin one by one, it turns out to be [A Yu] wearing a bellyband.
0:20:6|0:20:11|At this moment, [Liu Jinxi] was buttoning up his shirt and walking into the restroom. He lowered his head and said to [A Yu].
0:20:25|0:20:37|Leaning against the door frame, [Liu Jinxi] smiled and spoke, then turned around and walked into the room. [A Yu] put on a coat and approached [Liu Jinxi] from behind.
0:20:55|0:21:3|[A Yu] squatted down and looked at [Liu Jinxi] sitting on his left, softly comforting him. [Liu Jinxi] then smiled and nodded.
0:21:38|0:21:51|At this moment, [Xu Baijiu] was sitting cross-legged on the bed in the inn, suddenly spitting out a mouthful of blood.
0:22:20|0:22:25|In the memory, [Xu Baijiu] sat paralyzed at the dining table, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth.
0:22:34|0:22:51|So [Xu Baijiu] aimed directly at the center of the sternum. A needle nearly 10 centimeters long was inserted halfway into the Tianzhu acupoint.
0:22:55|0:23:3|This is the doppelganger that [Xu Baijiu] had imagined.
0:23:3|0:23:11|At this moment, he was sitting across from [Xu Baijiu], looking at him coldly. The next morning, the sound of chopping vegetables could be heard outside a small house.
0:23:11|0:23:17|The camera zooms in, revealing that [A Yu] is preparing a meal, and she is startled by a cough.
0:23:17|0:23:23|Turning around, [Liu Jinxi] realized it was actually [Xu Baijiu]. [A Yu] smiled at him.
0:23:54|0:24:0|[A Yu], who was about to ladle porridge, suddenly stopped and then put down the lid.
0:24:7|0:24:13|In his memory, [Liu Jinxi] knelt before the clan leader, watching his name being inscribed into the clan genealogy.
0:24:22|0:24:27|Just as she straightened up, [A Yu] heard [Xu Baijiu] asking. And she found herself once again lost in memories.
0:24:27|0:24:33|She stood in the pond, scooping fish with a bamboo basket, then looked towards the shore.
0:24:54|0:24:55|[A Yu] shakes the lunch box.
0:24:55|0:25:3|[A Yu] blinked and said.
0:25:5|0:25:11|Seeing [A Yu] turning towards the stove, [Xu Baijiu] squinted and asked. After listening, [A Yu] turned back and glanced at him.
0:25:47|0:25:52|[ A Yu ] is talking while stirring the vegetables with a spoon.
0:25:55|0:26:1|Then [A Yu] picked up the vegetables on the stove,
0:26:1|0:26:7|After a moment of contemplation, he looked straight at [Xu Baijiu]. The scene shifted, and [Liu Jinxi] remained the same as usual.
0:26:7|0:26:15|After leaving home, he arrived at the grasslands, passed through the misty grasslands, and then entered the dense forest.
0:26:15|0:26:28|In the sunlight, wearing a straw hat, he walks through the rugged forest and finally arrives at the paper mill, where he pounds paper scraps up and down.
0:26:31|0:26:36|[Xu Baijiu] found [Liu Jinxi] and brought him to the cabinet shop.
0:27:1|0:27:21|From the perspective of [Xu Baijiu], [Liu Jinxi] first took a sharp elbow from Yan Dongsheng at the waist, then he jumped in place, exerted force, and kicked directly on the ceiling with both feet. At this moment, he happened to dodge a knife from the short man. The reason [Xu Baijiu] thought this way was because he looked up and saw some strange marks at the scene.
0:27:21|0:27:27|There are very clear footprints on the ceiling, door pillars, and rafters.
0:27:35|0:27:42|In Xu Baijiu's eyes, Liu Jinxi dodged Yan Dongsheng's attack, then grabbed his arm and forcefully smashed it down.
0:28:6|0:28:11|After listening to the statements of Liu Jinxi and the innkeeper, Xu Baijiu fell into contemplation.
0:28:11|0:28:27|In his view, when the short man was about to chop at [Liu Jinxi] from behind with a knife, [Liu Jinxi] dodged to the side and at the same time used his left palm to push Yan Dongsheng's head up. The short man, who didn't have time to retract his knife, directly cut off Yan Dongsheng's left ear.
0:28:42|0:28:54|In the landlady's memory, the short man leaped high with a knife from the hall, ready to jump into the counter, but accidentally hit the corner of the counter, and ended up hitting himself to death.
0:28:54|0:29:10|However, [Xu Baijiu] didn't see it that way. After Yan Dongsheng's ear was cut off, he quickly smashed [Liu Jinxi] towards the counter, but [Liu Jinxi] stood firm with internal strength.
0:29:17|0:29:33|At this moment, [Xu Baijiu] saw [Liu Jinxi] standing by the counter with a horse stance, arms open, then clenched his fists tightly after a moment of thought, looking towards Yan Dongsheng's direction. He noticed that [Liu Jinxi] seemed like a different person, while Yan Dongsheng was panting heavily with his mouth open.
0:29:33|0:29:55|At this moment, [Liu Jinxi] kicked the water scoop on the ground towards the window, and then the entire cabinet shop became sealed. Seeing [Liu Jinxi] like this, Yan Dongsheng and the short man walked towards him with small steps. Suddenly, Yan Dongsheng took the initiative to attack, smashing towards [Liu Jinxi] with fast and fierce punches. Unexpectedly, [Liu Jinxi] agilely dodged and even grabbed Yan Dongsheng's eyes with a claw.
0:29:55|0:30:1|After pushing away Liu Jinxi's hand, Yan Dongsheng angrily swung his fists at him again.
0:30:1|0:30:17|At this moment, [Liu Jinxi] used his left hand to press down Yan Dongsheng's arm and fist on his abdomen, then struck Yan Dongsheng's right elbow with his right hand. Following the clenched fist, Yan Dongsheng punched himself in the face, causing a tooth to be knocked out directly.
0:30:17|0:30:29|After puncturing the medicine wine bottle on the counter, it slowly fell into the bottom of the bottle. But Yan Dongsheng was not giving up, [Liu Jinxi] circled behind him, pressing his knee against the bend of his leg, waiting for Yan Dongsheng to just turn around.
0:30:29|0:30:46|[Liu Jinxi] has rushed up to him, then, with three fierce kicks, he kicks Yan Dongsheng's abdomen, causing Yan Dongsheng to spit blood, clutching his stomach and kneeling directly on the ground. Seeing this, the short man picks up a knife and tries to chop at [Liu Jinxi], but [Liu Jinxi] jumps onto the counter, dodging every swing of the knife.
0:30:46|0:30:55|When he reached the counter, [Liu Jinxi] did a backflip over the short man behind him, then hooked one foot on the beam. Looking at [Liu Jinxi] like this,
0:30:55|0:31:12|The short man hesitated for a moment, then took the knife and swung it towards Liu Jinxi. Liu Jinxi dodged, hanging upside down, with his index finger slightly bent, directly pointing at the left clavicle of the short man, causing his heart to stop abruptly through the blood vessel at that point.
0:31:20|0:31:31|Therefore, the short man fell to the ground with his eyes wide open, and after seeing him die, [Liu Jinxi] jumped down from the rafters.
0:31:44|0:31:50|Liu Jinxi pushed open the door of the cabinet and led Xu Baijiu to the edge of the pond.
0:31:52|0:31:58|[Xu Baijiu] looked at [Liu Jinxi] with an innocent face, and voiced his own doubts.
0:32:5|0:32:11|[Xu Baijiu] believes that [Liu Jinxi] is deliberately hiding in the pond to make others think he really doesn't know kung fu.
0:32:11|0:32:20|And hiding under the water, Liu Jinxi couldn't exert his strength against Yan Dongsheng, so he could only punch the water surface one punch at a time to waste energy.
0:32:20|0:32:31|Although [Liu Jinxi] demonstrated in front of [Xu Baijiu] how he struggled and resisted at that time, [Xu Baijiu] insisted that evil deeds come from those with strong martial arts skills.
0:32:31|0:32:40|His right hand formed a fist, using the thumb joint to fiercely strike Sect Leader's temple, causing Sect Leader's cheek to quickly swell up.
0:32:49|0:32:57|Therefore, [Yan Dongsheng] fell straight backwards.
0:34:19|0:34:25|The clan leader gathered at Liu Jinxi's home and, after informing A Yu of the good news, she directly shed tears of joy.
0:34:25|0:34:32|At this moment, [Liu Jinxi] is cutting bamboo in the bamboo forest. He supports the bamboo with one hand and wipes his sweat with his sleeve from time to time.
0:34:32|0:34:39|[Xu Baijiu] carefully observed his movements on the side.
0:34:54|0:34:58|[Liu Jinxi] ignored [Xu Baijiu] and walked across the stone bridge carrying bamboo.
0:35:6|0:35:12|[Xu Baijiu] suddenly grabbed the end of the bamboo and forcefully flung [Liu Jinxi] off the stone bridge.
0:35:26|0:35:32|Unexpectedly, the branch suddenly broke, and he fell headfirst into the turbulent river below.
0:35:33|0:35:40|[Xu Baijiu] stood at the edge of the bridge, lost in thought.
0:36:6|0:36:13|Seeing five or six workers helping [Liu Jinxi] walk from the riverbank, [Xu Baijiu] squatted by the bridge and asked with a smile.
0:36:13|0:36:21|[Liu Jinxi] shook his head first, then walked up and squatted in front of [Xu Baijiu].
0:37:0|0:37:10|[Liu Jinxi] wiped the water off his face with his hand, and when he saw [Xu Baijiu] looking at him seriously, he thought for a moment and then smiled and said.
0:37:21|0:37:36|After speaking, the smile on [Liu Jinxi]'s face gradually disappeared, but his eyes remained fixed on [Xu Baijiu]. After a moment of silence, [Xu Baijiu] spoke.
0:37:37|0:37:51|[Xu Baijiu] didn't speak again, but crossed his hands in front of his chest, looking excitedly at [Liu Jinxi].
0:37:51|0:38:3|The scene then shifts to the edge of the pond in the village, where the women are washing clothes here.
0:38:51|0:38:57|The man smoking a cigar walked past the pond with [Xu Baijiu].
0:38:57|0:39:4|After giving him a few words of advice, she left the village. As night fell, the [Liu Jinxi] family sat around the table enjoying hotpot.
0:39:4|0:39:9|But [A Yu] appeared very uneasy, as it turned out that [Xu Baijiu] was also present.
0:39:31|0:39:39|[Xu Baijiu] answered while eating vegetables.
0:40:34|0:40:41|[Xu Baijiu] chewed on some food, then pointed at Xiaotian and asked.
0:40:41|0:40:49|Xiaotian heard Xu Baijiu call his name, first looked up at him, then widened his eyes and looked at Liu Jinxi.
0:40:49|0:40:56|And [Liu Jinxi] did not answer, but instead picked up a piece of food from the hotpot and put it into Xiaotian's bowl.
0:41:12|0:41:22|Facing Xu Baijiu's questioning, Liu Jinxi put down his bowl, took a sip of wine, nodded and said.
0:41:28|0:41:34|[Liu Jinxi] put down his chopsticks, lowered his head to look at the table, while [A Yu] cautiously raised her eyes to look at him.
0:41:44|0:41:50|[Liu Jinxi] turned his head to the left while speaking, and glanced at [Xu Baijiu].
0:42:6|0:42:21|Finally, he turned around and looked at the boiling hotpot in front of him, lost in thought, and whispered.
0:42:21|0:42:23|After hearing this story, [Xu Baijiu] was stunned.
0:42:23|0:42:35|Liu Jinxi then took the initiative to lift the wine glass, gesturing to have a drink with him. Xu Baijiu, who had come to his senses, quickly picked up the wine glass next to him in response, but still squinted at him.
0:42:36|0:42:44|Xiaotian asked foolishly. [Liu Jinxi] looked at Xiaotian, smiled, and shook his head at him.
0:42:44|0:42:52|But when he looked up, he saw the worried face of [A Yu], so he grinned at [A Yu] to indicate that he was fine now.
0:42:53|0:43:2|Liu Jinxi then turned around and reminded [Xu Baijiu], who quickly took out his pocket watch.
0:43:10|0:43:17|At this moment, [Xu Baijiu] picked up the clothes on the chair, stood up from the dining table, walked straight to the door, and headed towards the direction of the second floor.
0:43:17|0:43:30|Late at night, he was squatting by the bed of the couple [Liu Jinxi], observing [Liu Jinxi], and then unsatisfiedly pressed his ear against [Liu Jinxi]'s nose.
0:43:40|0:43:46|Liu Jinxi looked at his hands and feet, then suddenly opened his eyes and collided head-on with Xu Baijiu.
0:43:47|0:43:54|He propped himself up and sat up. [Xu Baijiu] showed no sign of remorse.
0:43:54|0:44:4|Liu Jinxi sighed helplessly at this. Liu Jinxi propped himself up with his legs and sat up from the bed.
0:44:4|0:44:12|Then, he slowly walked towards the dining table. [Xu Baijiu] frowned and squatted by the bed, watching him leave.
0:44:29|0:44:34|In the center of the village, [Fang Zheng] heard his own name,
0:44:42|0:44:49|[Liu Jinxi] and his wife smiled as they helped [Fang Zheng] put on his robe. At that moment,
0:44:51|0:44:54|[Xu Baijiu] is sitting in the tavern, looking at the family of [Liu Jinxi].
0:44:56|0:45:3|[Fang Zheng] put on his outer robe, then after leaving [Liu Jinxi], he took a joss stick from the hands of a fellow clan member.
0:45:3|0:45:9|[Liu Jinxi] looked at the square figure and smiled, suddenly, he saw [Xu Baijiu] in the tavern not far away.
0:45:9|0:45:15|At this moment, [Sect Leader] led the boys holding incense, gathering in front of the line.
0:45:22|0:45:27|The boys then eagerly stepped up the stairs and inserted the incense into the censer.
0:45:28|0:45:41|On the other side, [Liu Jinxi] crossed the bustling crowd in the center of the village and entered the tavern. He then sat down next to [Xu Baijiu], let out a long sigh, and watched as he raised his glass and drank heartily.
0:45:43|0:45:50|[Xu Baijiu] froze in the middle of drinking, and after setting down the cup, he said.
0:46:24|0:46:32|[Xu Baijiu] gave a wry smile at [Liu Jinxi], who then pursed his lips and spoke.
0:46:32|0:46:41|Xu Baijiu, who was originally looking down at his wine glass, immediately looked up at Liu Jinxi after hearing. Liu Jinxi blinked, then gathered his courage to speak.
0:46:58|0:47:4|At this point, [Liu Jinxi] couldn't help but lower his head, fiercely closed his eyes, and then spoke again.
0:48:10|0:48:18|Liu Jinxi, who was originally bowing his head, suddenly stood up and looked at Xu Baijiu. Xu Baijiu thought for a moment and immediately exclaimed in shock without saying a word.
0:48:28|0:48:34|Originally, Xu Baijiu's initial intuition was correct, Liu Jinxi, this person, indeed has a problem.
0:48:43|0:48:50|[Liu Jinxi] lowered his eyes and prayed softly. While [Xu Baijiu] gasped for breath and stared at him.
0:49:11|0:49:15|Outside the house, he picked up Xiao Tian and supported his bottom with one hand.
0:49:15|0:49:24|Then, he turned back to look in the direction of [Xu Baijiu], locking eyes with him. [Xu Baijiu] gazed at the family of four and slowly stood up.
0:49:24|0:49:28|Following behind them, blending in with the crowd.
0:49:28|0:49:36|In the bustling market, villagers led cows and sheep through the crowd. The animals attracted many flies.
0:49:36|0:49:42|Some even climbed onto people's necks and shoulders. Suddenly, [Xu Baijiu] was shocked.
0:49:58|0:50:12|At this moment, the imaginary doppelganger created by [Xu Baijiu] appeared again. Therefore, [Xu Baijiu] grabbed a sickle and rushed behind [Liu Jinxi], catching him off guard and fiercely chopping towards his right shoulder.
0:50:12|0:50:22|A Yu, who was originally joking with Liu Jinxi, was startled by the sudden turn of events, and let out a scream on the spot. Fangzheng and Xiaotian also stood still, staring at Xu Baijiu with wide eyes.
0:50:22|0:50:31|[Liu Jinxi] was shocked and gritted his teeth, glancing at his shoulder before turning to look at him. Disheartened, [Xu Baijiu] returned to the inn.
0:50:31|0:50:40|Sitting on the edge of the bed, [Liu Jinxi] angrily threw the umbrella in his hand and then turned his head to kick hard at the imaginary doppelganger.
0:50:41|0:50:50|He then arrived at the tavern.
0:51:22|0:51:30|After being angrily scolded by the villagers, [Xu Baijiu] returned to the room. He looked at the tightly closed door, breathing heavily.
0:51:30|0:51:35|At this moment, a knocking sound is heard, and [Xu Baijiu] pursed his lips as he opened the door.
0:51:35|0:51:43|The man who was smoking a cigar earlier has arrived.
0:52:7|0:52:16|The identity of the man with the cigar turned out to be a spy.
0:52:50|0:52:56|[Xu Baijiu] recalled the scene of the crime and then said.
0:52:56|0:53:14|At this moment, the young [Liu Jinxi] stood in the butcher's house, surrounded by the carcasses of cows and sheep hanging all around, and the floor littered with dissected bodies, yet he remained calm, looking at everything here with composure.
0:53:26|0:53:42|In pouring rain, [Xu Baijiu] hurriedly walked with an umbrella towards the county town, only to meet [Liu Jinxi] on a village path. He was leading the villagers to shelter from the rain with an old cow, and their eyes met as they crossed paths.
0:53:44|0:53:52|The sudden thunder alerted [Xu Baijiu] to the true identity of [Liu Jinxi]. He stood frozen in place, looking at him happily laughing towards himself.
0:53:52|0:54:8|Later, the two of them sought shelter from the rain in a pavilion together. After [Xu Baijiu] closed the umbrella, he wiped his face with his sleeve, using this action to secretly observe [Liu Jinxi].
0:54:10|0:54:17|Liu Jinxi, who was originally hesitant to look at Xu Baijiu, immediately turned his head to look at him after hearing him out, and then spoke.
0:54:31|0:54:42|Then he opened his mouth, smiled, and looked at [Liu Jinxi]. At this moment, [Liu Jinxi] turned his head to glance at [Xu Baijiu], smiled, and then turned back to look into the distance.
0:54:42|0:54:51|And [Xu Baijiu] trembled and lowered his head.
0:54:54|0:55:5|After finishing speaking, without waiting for a response from [Xu Baijiu], [Liu Jinxi] put on his straw hat and walked out of the pavilion. The rain had stopped by now, and he had already entered the jungle with [Xu Baijiu].
0:55:5|0:55:11|Tall straight trees cast a misty veil over everything around. Passing by a tombstone, [Liu Jinxi]...
0:55:11|0:55:16|A chilling scream suddenly flowed into the ears.
0:55:18|0:55:24|[Liu Jinxi] walked ahead and whispered.
0:55:29|0:55:37|[Xu Baijiu] followed behind, watching [Liu Jinxi]'s back as he answered. Suddenly, [Liu Jinxi] stopped in his tracks.
0:55:37|0:55:43|Turning slowly, [Liu Jinxi] looked at [Xu Baijiu], who was five steps away, and spoke.
0:55:44|0:55:50|[Xu Baijiu] held his breath instantly, swallowed hard, and stared at [Liu Jinxi] without blinking.
0:55:50|0:55:57|At this moment, [Liu Jinxi] smiled at him, then turned around and continued walking forward.
0:55:57|0:56:6|When Liu Jinxi was ten steps away, Xu Baijiu took another step and followed behind, stopping every two steps.
0:56:6|0:56:13|Suddenly, [Liu Jinxi] stopped again, then he slowly turned around and smiled at [Xu Baijiu].
0:56:14|0:56:24|The two of them happened to walk to the front of the tombstone. After listening, [Xu Baijiu] took a small step back, then stood still, watching [Liu Jinxi] walking towards him.
0:56:24|0:56:31|At this moment, [Liu Jinxi] stood in front of [Xu Baijiu], and after looking at [Xu Baijiu], he suddenly reached out his right hand.
0:56:31|0:56:40|He had his arms around [Xu Baijiu]'s back, then he spoke.
0:56:41|0:56:50|[Xu Baijiu] glanced to the right, his left hand resting on [Liu Jinxi]'s waist without moving.
0:56:50|0:57:0|Liu Jinxi released his back, ending this brief embrace, and looked at him as he spoke.
0:57:1|0:57:8|[Xu Baijiu] quickly came to his senses, grinned at [Liu Jinxi], and then swayed past him.
0:57:8|0:57:14|In a moment of passing, [Liu Jinxi] slowly turned towards [Xu Baijiu], unmoving, staring at his back.
0:57:15|0:57:18|It seems like they can feel the pressure coming from behind.
0:57:18|0:57:36|[Xu Baijiu] closed his lips tightly, stiffened his neck and walked forward mechanically. Suddenly, he stopped in his tracks, then slowly looked back. At this moment, in the vast forest, there was no trace of [Liu Jinxi]. Everything around seemed to be sleeping in the fear of death.
0:57:36|0:57:44|So [Xu Baijiu] turned around and ran forward desperately, with tombstones standing everywhere in the woods and eerie screams filling the air.
0:57:44|0:57:50|It gave people the illusion of being in the underworld. Therefore, [Xu Baijiu] ran faster and faster.
0:57:50|0:57:58|Passing through narrow and winding forest paths, until exhausted.
0:58:0|0:58:8|The scene changes, [Xu Baijiu] arrives at a bathhouse.
0:58:47|0:58:56|Captain Hu Zi thought for a moment and then said.
0:59:11|0:59:16|[Xu Baijiu] saw Captain Hu turning and walking away, and angrily smashed the table.
0:59:16|0:59:23|In the bustling street at this moment, people are coming and going.
0:59:25|0:59:29|[Xu Baijiu] stood lifelessly in the crowd.
0:59:29|0:59:40|As the night fell, he arrived at a grand mansion and stood on the stone street in front of the hall, staring at the plaques on the platform in silence. The sound of servants passing by in the mansion...
0:59:40|0:59:49|Make him slowly come to his senses. Then, he looked up to the right and saw a woman in a cheongsam standing on the second-floor corridor, looking at him.
0:59:49|0:59:55|Later, the two sat in the hall, and the woman handed something to [Xu Baijiu].
0:59:56|1:0:3|The woman turned out to be his ex-wife, and it's obvious what he just gave her.
1:0:3|1:0:8|After receiving the money, [Xu Baijiu] quickly put it into the bag he carried with him.
1:0:8|1:0:18|He then pursed his lips and asked. His ex-wife lowered her head, hands clasped on her lap, and responded softly.
1:0:35|1:0:46|Seeing the sadness in his ex-wife's eyes, [Xu Baijiu] asked her. She suddenly looked up and glanced at [Xu Baijiu],
1:0:46|1:0:54|After thinking for a moment, [Liu Jinxi] lowered his head and said.
1:1:15|1:1:35|Liu Jinxi's ex-wife's tears were swirling in her eyes, and [Xu Baijiu] looked at her like this, blinked, shook his head, and then spoke. After speaking, he lowered his head.
1:1:47|1:1:54|Although [Xu Baijiu] kept his head down, his ex-wife still stared at him intently. They had now arrived at a bustling street.
1:1:54|1:2:1|[Xu Baijiu] sat on the horse, deep in thought.
1:2:1|1:2:7|[Xu Baijiu] and his colleagues slowly made their way through the bustling crowd, walking forward with determination.
1:2:22|1:2:36|[Xu Baijiu] exchanged silver tickets for playing cards, first went to the foreman to complain, and then went to his ex-wife's house. In the hall, he took off his hat, bowed deeply to his ex-father-in-law's tablet.
1:2:36|1:2:39|The scene suddenly changes.
1:3:2|1:3:9|Captain Hu said to [Sect Leader].
1:3:13|1:3:19|Captain Hu turned back to look at [Xu Kun], then he shrunk his neck and looked up at [Sect Leader].
1:3:20|1:3:27|Surrounded by strong henchmen, General Hu with a long beard trembled and said fearfully.
1:4:2|1:4:10|[Xu Kun] lifted the bearded officer up and held him in front of him.
1:4:20|1:4:27|With that, [Sect Leader] clenched his right fist and fiercely smashed his thumb knuckle towards the temple of General Hu.
1:4:28|1:4:33|In an instant, General Beard's eyes were bloodshot, then he slumped down diagonally.
1:4:34|1:4:40|In the warehouse, not a single person dared to respond.
1:4:54|1:5:1|In the warehouse, a woman in armor listened to Xu Baijiu's words,
1:5:1|1:5:8|Squinting his eyes, [Liu Jinxi] found himself back in the village, where the old folks sat around a pile of grass, wearing grasshopper hats.
1:5:9|1:5:25|After forcefully breaking off the head of a live grasshopper, thread a thin stick through the tail of the grasshopper, then pull the body of the grasshopper down, and continue threading another live one. On the other side, in the center of the village, the children have all put on their costumes and are ready to perform a play.
1:5:32|1:5:39|Beside the haystack, a burly man lifted a hoe and vigorously turned over the soil in the ground, muttering something from time to time.
1:5:39|1:5:46|At this moment, [Xu Baijiu] and a group of colleagues rode slowly on horses, then he asked the person next to him.
1:5:57|1:6:5|The colleague glanced at the villagers working and then explained to [Xu Baijiu].
1:6:5|1:6:11|Suddenly, a few people riding horses, wearing armor and holding torches, arrived in the village.
1:6:11|1:6:19|When passing through a villager's house, he directly threw the torch in. And all the villagers were in the center of the village, watching the children sing opera.
1:6:19|1:6:26|The drums and gongs were lively, but no one noticed anything unusual. Soon, the village was set on fire by those people everywhere.
1:6:53|1:7:6|As soon as the words fell, [Xu Baijiu] descended from the roof, a woman in armor stepped over the line and jumped to the ground. After scanning the villagers with narrowed eyes, she turned around and walked towards [Liu Jinxi].
1:7:8|1:7:15|Liu Jinxi remained indifferent as Thirteen Sister delivered a slap. Then she pointed fiercely at Liu Jinxi.
1:7:17|1:7:25|[Liu Jinxi] squinted his eyes and looked at Thirteen Sister. Suddenly, Thirteen Sister kicked [Liu Jinxi] in the abdomen.
1:7:26|1:7:33|Pushing [Liu Jinxi] hard, [A Yu] then stepped on his chest, causing him to spit out blood on the spot.
1:7:36|1:7:40|[A Yu] covered his square mouth, looking worriedly at [Liu Jinxi] lying on the ground.
1:7:40|1:7:49|Seeing [Liu Jinxi] showing no intention to fight back, Thirteen Sister retracted her foot and shouted loudly at the people around her.
1:7:57|1:8:2|The villagers were instantly scared and backed away, while [A Yu] quickly covered Fangzheng and Xiaotian's eyes.
1:8:3|1:8:12|Thirteen Sister stood in front of the crowd, holding a short knife, glaring angrily at [Liu Jinxi]. Suddenly, she grabbed a villager and was about to strike down.
1:8:12|1:8:17|[Liu Jinxi] finally made his move, grabbing a table and throwing it towards Thirteen Sister.
1:8:17|1:8:24|Thirteen Sister immediately turned the blade around, forcefully stabbing it into the table, then with a swing of her hand, she split the table in half.
1:8:24|1:8:30|At this moment, [Liu Jinxi] has arrived in front of Thirteen Sister, and he fiercely kicks towards her.
1:8:30|1:8:36|Thirteen Sister, despite using her arms to block, was still sent flying by the force of [Liu Jinxi].
1:8:37|1:8:41|Seeing [Liu Jinxi] finally getting a response, Thirteen Sister's lips curved slightly.
1:8:41|1:8:49|Next, [Liu Jinxi] stood with his feet apart, his fists moving like meteors from his chest to his waist, ultimately stretching out like a bow.
1:8:49|1:8:58|With a stylish and handsome posture, Xiao Tian widened his eyes on the spot. Seeing this, [Xu Baijiu] also struck the same pose and attacked [Liu Jinxi].
1:8:58|1:9:6|Four fists clashed in the air, with Thirteen Sister pulling out a short knife and waving her dual blades towards [Liu Jinxi].
1:9:6|1:9:11|Liu Jinxi maneuvered between the two, using his elbow to strike hard at the foot that Thirteen Sister kicked towards him.
1:9:12|1:9:19|Shortly after, a divine dragon-like kick was aimed at [Xu Baijiu]'s neck. [Xu Baijiu] was sent flying directly to the side of a chair by the kick.
1:9:19|1:9:24|Then, taking advantage of Thirteen Sister's unpreparedness, he grabbed her waist and viciously threw her into the air.
1:9:24|1:9:35|At this moment, [Xu Baijiu] has already gotten up from the ground, steadied himself, and charged towards [Liu Jinxi] once again. [Liu Jinxi] lowered his center of gravity and delivered a series of punches to [Xu Baijiu]'s abdomen.
1:9:35|1:9:42|He then jumped in place and fiercely kneed Xu Baijiu in the temple. Then he ruthlessly struck Xu Baijiu's chest as if venting his anger.
1:9:42|1:9:47|During the action, the table with the mahjong tiles was shaken down.
1:9:48|1:9:57|[Liu Jinxi] listened and instantly became alert. When he turned his head, he found that the villagers around him had already left. [A Yu] was staring at him in a daze.
1:10:0|1:10:6|The villagers not far away just realized that their houses were on fire, so they all rushed back home in a panic.
1:10:6|1:10:12|[Liu Jinxi] glanced at [A Yu] holding two children, then turned and ran towards the direction outside the village.
1:10:12|1:10:19|Passing by a villager's house, [Liu Jinxi] swiftly took a shortcut by flipping over and stepping on the roof tiles to make a quick exit.
1:10:19|1:10:23|Thirteen Sister took a look at the mother and son, then immediately turned around and caught up with [Liu Jinxi].
1:10:23|1:10:30|At this moment, [Liu Jinxi] is running ahead, stepping on roof tiles, while Thirteen Sister is closely following behind, wielding a pair of knives.
1:10:30|1:10:38|[A Yu] and two children stood still, watching [Liu Jinxi] getting farther and farther away from them. Gradually, [Liu Jinxi]'s figure,
1:10:38|1:10:41|Disappeared from sight. The scene shifts,
1:10:41|1:10:47|[Liu Jinxi] jumped down from a three-meter high roof, rolled to cushion the impact, and then continued to accelerate forward.
1:10:47|1:10:53|When he reached the eaves, he lightly supported himself with both hands, then leaped up effortlessly, easily overcoming the obstacle.
1:10:53|1:10:58|Unexpectedly, the roof gave way and [Liu Jinxi] fell straight into the cowshed.
1:10:58|1:11:4|Seeing Thirteen Sister following closely behind, he quickly grabbed the iron chain on the eaves and kicked towards her.
1:11:5|1:11:10|Liu Jinxi looked at Thirteen Sister standing up and said.
1:11:14|1:11:20|Liu Jinxi tiptoed, raised his arm, and tightly pinched Thirteen Sister with his right hand.
1:11:20|1:11:29|Thirteen Sister took the lead in launching an attack, her wrists flipping with dual knives. [Liu Jinxi]'s clothes and sleeves were instantly slashed by the blade.
1:11:29|1:11:42|Then he chased [Liu Jinxi] into the fence, crouched down and stabbed the knife directly into [Liu Jinxi]'s left thigh, followed by kicking his cheek with his foot, causing [Liu Jinxi] to crash through the fence and fall into the corner.
1:11:42|1:11:48|Thirteen Sister pursued aggressively, wielding her dual blades towards [Liu Jinxi]. Unexpectedly, he rolled forward with a somersault.
1:11:48|1:11:54|Watching [Liu Jinxi] stand up again, hands raised in front of his chest, fingers slightly bent in a ready stance.
1:11:54|1:12:2|Thirteen Sister wielded her dual blades, twisting her body and slashing towards him alternately. Just as it seemed about to hit Liu Jinxi's head,
1:12:2|1:12:10|But he was hit back with a punch on the inside of his forearm. Relentless Thirteen Niang, with eyes full of killing intent, continuously flashed her twin blades from both sides of [Liu Jinxi].
1:12:10|1:12:14|Grabbing the handle of the knife, he thrust it upwards towards his abdomen.
1:12:14|1:12:19|As a result, [Liu Jinxi] extended his arms and casually inserted the knife into the wooden stake.
1:12:19|1:12:27|Later, [Liu Jinxi] pried open Thirteen Sister's hand holding the knife handle, spreading her five fingers apart, and ruthlessly bent her fingers downwards.
1:12:27|1:12:40|Taking advantage of Thirteen Sister's distraction, he repeatedly punched her neck with both fists, causing her to step back continuously. Then, [Liu Jinxi] kicked away the knife thrown by Thirteen Sister, grabbed her waist, and ruthlessly smashed her towards the feeding trough.
1:12:40|1:12:49|Seeing that she still refused to give up, [Liu Jinxi] leaped in front of Thirteen Sister, his two fingers slightly bent and aimed straight at her eyes, but he hesitated to strike.
1:12:50|1:12:57|Suddenly, Thirteen Sister swung the wall up, was thrown to the corner by [Liu Jinxi], and then pulled out a short knife and ruthlessly stabbed into the back of the cow.
1:12:57|1:13:1|The startled bull lifted its front hooves and charged towards [Liu Jinxi].
1:13:1|1:13:17|Seeing that they were about to collide, [Liu Jinxi] grabbed the cow's foot with one hand, flipped and jumped, using his leg to hook onto the beam. Meanwhile, Thirteen Sister, who was sitting on the ground, was surrounded by four cows before she could get up, and in the chaos, she was directly trampled on her abdomen by the cows.
1:13:17|1:13:25|Suddenly, a cow burst out of the cowshed and [Liu Jinxi] quickly jumped down from the beam after seeing it.
1:13:25|1:13:42|At this moment, Thirteen Sister was thrown out of the cowshed by the bull's horns, and to everyone's shock, outside the cowshed was a raging river, with a waterfall nearly 40 meters high in the distance. After the bull fell into the river, it was swiftly carried towards the waterfall by the rushing water.
1:13:42|1:13:49|The waterfall is about as wide as a truck, and the river looks like an angry dragon, making a thunderous sound.
1:13:50|1:14:3|At this moment, [Liu Jinxi] clung to the edge of the cowshed with one hand and grabbed Thirteen Sister hanging over the river with the other hand. Thirteen Sister, spitting out blood, looked at [Liu Jinxi] and laughed.
1:14:3|1:14:19|[Liu Jinxi] finally couldn't hold on any longer. The hands of the two gradually separated, and in the end, Thirteen Sister fell into the river, then was washed down a nearly 40-meter waterfall by the rushing river.
1:14:19|1:14:25|[Liu Jinxi] maintained a tense posture, staring fixedly at the distant waterfall, and silently lowered his head.
1:14:25|1:14:28|On the small road by the river outside the village,
1:14:28|1:14:37|A group of men in armor riding horses quickly approach the village. Inside the village, at the home of Liu Jinxi, A Yu is busy packing up with the children.
1:14:37|1:14:42|After bowing to the memorial tablets, [Liu Jinxi] carefully placed them into the bundle.
1:14:43|1:14:51|At this moment, she saw someone approaching out of the corner of her eye, stood up straight and turned around, only to find that the person was actually Liu Jinxi.
1:14:51|1:14:57|[A Yu] hesitated for a moment, then hurried to the door, supporting him and helping him into the house.
1:14:57|1:15:9|After speaking, [A Yu] walked towards the room, while [Liu Jinxi] slowly half-knelt down, bowing his head to look at the scattered luggage in the room.
1:15:47|1:15:52|Liu Jinxi looked at A Yu squatting in front of him, with disheveled hair, and spoke with difficulty.
1:15:52|1:15:58|[A Yu] immediately stood up after hearing this, turned around, and walked towards the main gate while sobbing.
1:15:58|1:16:8|She gently closed the door as she arrived at the entrance, then used her head to support the door panel, and lifted her hand to securely hang the door latch above.
1:16:8|1:16:13|After a moment of calm, [A Yu] continued to insert the second bolt into the door lock.
1:16:13|1:16:27|After inserting the two bolts, she seemed to have used up all her strength, so she did not return to the father and son for a long time. Instead, she kept hitting the door with her head, crying uncontrollably.
1:16:27|1:16:34|[Liu Jinxi] just pursed his lips and made no response upon hearing this. At that moment, [A Yu] stopped crying.
1:16:34|1:16:41|Looking back, Liu Jinxi and Xu Baijiu, who were packing their bags, shed a silent tear and whispered.
1:16:43|1:16:52|[A Yu] looked at the back of [Liu Jinxi], sniffed, lowered her head and asked again.
1:16:54|1:16:59|Then she tightly grasped the door frame, tears continuously dripping down her cheeks.
1:17:0|1:17:6|Upon hearing the question, [Liu Jinxi] did not respond, but just blinked his eyes and remained silent.
1:17:6|1:17:13|Seeing [Liu Jinxi] like this, [A Yu] seemed to know the answer to the question, so she turned around, leaned against the door frame, and burst into tears.
1:17:13|1:17:27|It was late at night, [Liu Jinxi] sat by Xiaotian's bed, staring at him motionlessly. Watching Xiaotian sleeping soundly, [Liu Jinxi] unconsciously swallowed and then fell into memories.
1:17:27|1:17:34|In the butcher's house, a man lifted a child in each hand and placed them by the door.
1:17:35|1:17:49|The butcher knelt in front of [Liu Jinxi], also known as Tang Long, continuously kowtowing and begging for mercy.
1:17:49|1:17:56|[Liu Jinxi] looked up at the two crying children by the door, then lowered the big knife on his shoulder.
1:17:56|1:18:2|His men pushed a man under the guillotine, and the cries stopped.
1:18:2|1:18:10|In the butcher's house, several people lay scattered around, while his men squatted down, flipping through them one by one.
1:18:12|1:18:16|A young boy placed under the guillotine softly calls out for [Liu Jinxi].
1:18:16|1:18:25|Upon hearing the sound, [Liu Jinxi] slowly walked towards the guillotine from the center of the room. The young boy widened his eyes and looked up at him.
1:18:27|1:18:35|The child, who looks to be only five or six years old, is being held up on the gate knife, with his feet not even reaching the ground.
1:18:35|1:18:43|But looking at the handsome face of [Liu Jinxi], the young boy still cried out for help. And [Liu Jinxi] just stared blankly.
1:18:43|1:18:51|Then he walked step by step towards the little boy. The scene cut back to Liu Jinxi sitting by Xiaotian's bed, covering his eyes and sobbing softly.
1:18:51|1:18:58|He then slowly put down his hand, wiped his face, and looked straight at the sleeping Xiao Tian.
1:18:58|1:19:5|But tears burst out again at this moment, [Liu Jinxi] shook his head while struggling to speak.
1:19:7|1:19:14|After speaking, he bit his lip, slowly lowered his head, and Xiao Tian, who was sleeping soundly, moved the corners of his mouth.
1:19:15|1:19:33|And [Liu Jinxi] once again covered his eyes with his hands, crying continuously. Suddenly, Xiaotian raised his little hand, touched [Liu Jinxi]'s cheek, and then pulled his hand into his own embrace. [Liu Jinxi] instantly stopped crying, holding Xiaotian with one hand and leaning his forehead against his.
1:19:33|1:19:39|The scene shifts to the side of the wooden pavilion in the village, where villagers are kneeling around a wooden table.
1:19:40|1:19:45|The mage, holding a candle, performed a ritual over the arrangement on the wooden table.
1:19:45|1:19:49|An old man is dressing the bodies lined up in a row with cloth socks.
1:19:49|1:19:53|Then neatly place them one by one into the bamboo basket.
1:19:54|1:20:4|At this moment, [Xu Baijiu] rode into the village on horseback and remarked upon seeing ashes everywhere.
1:20:6|1:20:13|His colleague looked around and replied. The air was filled with the choking residue of burnt cotton.
1:20:13|1:20:22|In the village, collapsed bricks and tiles are everywhere. At this moment, [Xu Baijiu] passes by a wooden pavilion and sees women kneeling by the bamboo baskets, crying sorrowfully.
1:20:22|1:20:27|Even saw the bodies charred by the fire in the bamboo basket.
1:20:45|1:20:51|Xu Baijiu's colleague asked impatiently. Suddenly, Liu Jinxi appeared in front of them.
1:20:51|1:20:57|[Xu Baijiu] stared at [Liu Jinxi] and said loudly.
1:20:57|1:21:2|Shortly after, [Liu Jinxi] limped towards [Xu Baijiu].
1:21:2|1:21:11|[Xu Baijiu] saw the situation, gently swayed his body, and then tightened the reins in his hand. At this moment, [Liu Jinxi] had already walked up to him.
1:21:11|1:21:17|Xu Baijiu cleared his throat and didn't say anything.
1:21:18|1:21:23|Xu Baijiu's colleague sat on the horse, asking in surprise.
1:21:41|1:21:50|With a large group of people leaving the village, only [Xu Baijiu] and [Liu Jinxi] remained in the blink of an eye. [Liu Jinxi] kept staring at [Xu Baijiu].
1:21:50|1:21:57|[Xu Baijiu] smiled awkwardly. On the other side, the villagers in the whole village were carrying hoes and bundles on their backs.
1:21:57|1:22:5|Slowly moving towards Tianzhai. In the crowd, [A Yu] and Fang Zheng are pulling Xiaotian up the steps one by one, following the main force.
1:22:5|1:22:16|[Liu Jinxi] and [Xu Baijiu] arrived at the riverbank. [Xu Baijiu] sat on the ground, burning paper and asking questions.
1:22:18|1:22:23|[Liu Jinxi] lowered his head, looked at the flames, and calmly replied.
1:22:23|1:22:31|[Xu Baijiu] sneered at [Liu Jinxi], only to find his expression very serious, and then [Liu Jinxi] nodded.
1:22:32|1:22:40|In an instant, [Xu Baijiu] widened his eyes and stared straight at him.
1:22:50|1:22:58|[Xu Baijiu] stopped burning the paper, looked at [Liu Jinxi] disapprovingly, then picked up a branch and started drawing on the ground.
1:23:7|1:23:17|Xu Baijiu was drawing the structure of the human body on the ground, describing his entire plan for Liu Jinxi.
1:24:5|1:24:11|At this moment, the villagers have arrived at Tianzhai, but the people of the Seventy-Two Earth Fiends have also arrived.
1:24:22|1:24:28|Members of the Seventy-Two Demons rode horses with long swords on their backs, crossing over a hill.
1:24:28|1:24:33|The hooves of the horse skimmed over the mud on the slope, kicking up clouds of dust.
1:24:33|1:24:39|And right in front of them, [Xu Baijiu] is pushing a cart with his colleagues, moving forward.
1:24:39|1:24:45|Seeing the opponent getting closer and closer, he lifted the cloth on the handcart and pressed it hard against [Liu Jinxi]'s neck.
1:24:45|1:24:50|Sensing the danger, the colleagues who were originally following [Xu Baijiu] quickly rode away on horses.
1:24:50|1:24:57|At this moment, [Sect Leader] and his seventy-two followers surrounded [Xu Baijiu] and the flatbed truck, trapping them in the middle.
1:24:57|1:25:6|Seeing nearly twenty people surrounding him, [Xu Baijiu] furrowed his brow and said,
1:25:6|1:25:11|The Sect Leader ignored his words and instead stared intently at Liu Jinxi under the cloth on the flatbed truck.
1:25:12|1:25:16|He then dismounted and walked straight to [Xu Baijiu].
1:25:16|1:25:23|With a forceful lift of the cloth, [Xu Kun] discovered that it was indeed [Liu Jinxi], and his hand holding the cloth trembled slightly.
1:25:23|1:25:29|He then covered his neck with his palm, as if verifying whether Liu Jinxi was truly dead.
1:25:29|1:25:32|In the end, he closed his eyes tightly.
1:25:34|1:25:44|Saying that, [Liu Jinxi] glared angrily at [Xu Baijiu], pointing at him fiercely with his hand. Seeing this, the colleague who was originally pulling the cart immediately abandoned [Xu Baijiu] and ran away.
1:25:44|1:25:55|At this moment, [Xu Kun] leaped onto the flatbed cart and squatted down. He lowered his head, staring intently at [Liu Jinxi]'s face, then began to sing, as a way to mourn for [Liu Jinxi].
1:26:44|1:26:49|In the cold cave, the villagers huddled against the cave wall, gazing at him.
1:26:50|1:26:55|[Sect Leader] leisurely surveyed the faces of each villager, then spoke again.
1:27:1|1:27:7|Xiaotian looked curiously at the back of [Sect Leader] upon hearing his own name. [A Yu] didn't have time to stop him.
1:27:7|1:27:13|Suddenly, [Sect Leader] turned around. On the other side, the mourning of [Xu Baijiu] continued.
1:27:13|1:27:21|After finishing the song, he scattered a handful of rice into the air. Then, the seventy-two Earth Fiends repeated the same action.
1:27:21|1:27:29|They showered rice around [Liu Jinxi]. Just as the watch was about to reach its peak, [Xu Baijiu] flipped and jumped onto the flatbed truck.
1:27:29|1:27:35|First, he delivered a heavy blow to [Liu Jinxi]'s chest, then proceeded to grab his neck.
1:27:35|1:27:45|At this moment, [Liu Jinxi]'s eyelids had already swollen, and he lay flat on his back heavily. So [Xu Baijiu] repeated the action of hitting his chest again.
1:27:45|1:27:54|The fight intensified, with [Xu Baijiu] straddling [Liu Jinxi]'s legs and pummeling him with both fists, but the man beneath him showed no reaction.
1:27:54|1:28:6|[Xu Baijiu] slumped back weakly, sitting on the flatbed cart, then stood back up on the ground amidst the astonished gazes of all seventy-two Earthly Fiends.
1:28:6|1:28:22|Suddenly, [Liu Jinxi] took a deep breath, then coughed forcefully, twisting his body into a ball on the flatbed to ease the repeated heavy blows to his chest. [Xu Baijiu] saw [Liu Jinxi] waking up and grinned happily.
1:28:22|1:28:27|At this moment, [Liu Jinxi] propped himself up with both arms and sat up unsteadily.
1:28:27|1:28:32|Liu Jinxi saw Xu Baijiu in front of him, breathing heavily and smiling at him with joy.
1:28:32|1:28:38|Xu Kun, who was originally five steps away from [Liu Jinxi], saw this and hurriedly rode his horse to his side.
1:28:39|1:28:47|[Liu Jinxi] then noticed the scene around him. Facing the sunlight, he saw the familiar faces of the former seventy-two Earth Fiends.
1:28:47|1:28:53|Xu Baijiu bent down to examine Liu Jinxi, then joyfully howled to the sky.
1:28:53|1:29:0|The people around also showed joyful expressions. Hearing the laughter of [Xu Baijiu], [Liu Jinxi] also smiled.
1:29:0|1:29:7|Turning slowly, he locked eyes with him. Suddenly, the smile on [Liu Jinxi]'s face vanished.
1:29:7|1:29:17|After lowering his eyes and turning his head, he forcefully tapped his left shoulder, pulled out Xu Baijiu's broadsword, stood up, and chopped off his left arm.
1:29:17|1:29:22|The sudden move left [Xu Baijiu] and the constable Xu stunned on the spot.
1:29:22|1:29:31|And [Liu Jinxi], due to blood loss and prolonged unconsciousness, knelt on the flatbed truck.
1:29:33|1:29:40|[Liu Jinxi] faced [Xu Baijiu] with a trembling body.
1:29:40|1:29:41|Shortly after, [Liu Jinxi] collapsed directly onto the armrest.
1:29:43|1:29:51|Xu Baijiu quickly stepped forward to embrace his body, looked around, and hurriedly picked up the cloth to wrap around his exposed left shoulder.
1:29:57|1:30:5|Watching [Liu Jinxi] self-harming, [Xu Baijiu] angrily shouted at him.
1:30:14|1:30:21|Soon after, [Xu Baijiu] bent down and said to [Liu Jinxi].
1:30:28|1:30:33|After saying that, [Xu Baijiu] quickly rode away with the seventy-two Earth Fiends.
1:30:33|1:30:44|Upon hearing the news, [Liu Jinxi] furrowed his brow and widened his eyes in an instant. With the help of [Xu Baijiu], he then struggled to stand up from the flatbed truck.
1:30:45|1:30:53|The scene shifts, [Liu Jinxi] is slowly walking through the woods towards home, his left shoulder, which is wrapped up, still oozing blood.
1:31:47|1:31:52|Xiaotian sat in the arms of [Sect Leader], and when he saw [Liu Jinxi] come to the dining table, he joyfully called out.
1:31:52|1:32:3|The Sect Leader, who was originally looking down at Xiao Tian, looked up ahead and saw Liu Jinxi with a severed arm, holding a big knife sitting across from him.
1:32:5|1:32:13|The Sect Leader extended two fingers, pointing at Liu Jinxi's left shoulder. The loud voice made Xiaotian sitting in front of him quickly cover his ears.
1:32:13|1:32:21|Shortly after, [Liu Jinxi] said. Upon hearing this, [Sect Leader] slowly lowered the two fingers pointing at [Liu Jinxi].
1:32:21|1:32:31|The muscles on his face, which were trembling with anger, gradually calmed down. Then he looked at [A Yu] and Fang Zheng, nodded, and said.
1:32:56|1:33:10|The Sect Leader picked up a piece of food for Xiaotian in his arms, then pursed his lips and asked A Yu straightly. A Yu trembled and nodded. After listening, A Yu quickly lowered his head, almost crying.
1:33:55|1:34:2|[Sect Leader] kicked [A Yu] directly, sending him flying into the corner, while [Liu Jinxi] tightly gripped the handle of the knife.
1:34:2|1:34:19|The Sect Leader held Xiaotian in front of him, swinging his small body in the air, then pressed the back of his head against his shoulder, looked at Liu Jinxi, and said with a lowered head.
1:34:48|1:34:53|[Sect Leader] Although he was speaking to Xiaotian, he kept staring at [Liu Jinxi],
1:34:53|1:35:4|At the same time, Xiaotian was firmly held in his arms. Remembering the days gone by, the [Sect Leader] burst into laughter. [Liu Jinxi] gripped the handle of the knife in his right hand, looking at the laughing [Sect Leader].
1:35:4|1:35:9|The corners of his mouth twitched, but the tip of the knife was firmly embedded in the ground.
1:35:9|1:35:16|At this moment, [Sect Leader]'s smile turned sinister, with his features even squeezed together, then he continued speaking.
1:35:42|1:35:48|[Sect Leader] stared at [Liu Jinxi] with gritted teeth, tears swirling in his eyes.
1:35:48|1:35:55|But [Liu Jinxi] remained unmoved, looking straight at him. The [Sect Leader] was stunned,
1:35:55|1:36:2|The Sect Leader then slowly looked at Liu Jinxi's left shoulder. After listening, he trembled and averted his gaze.
1:36:2|1:36:6|Then slowly lowered his head and looked at Xiaotian in his arms.
1:36:6|1:36:10|At this moment, [Liu Jinxi] looked at [Sect Leader] with determination in his eyes.
1:36:11|1:36:17|Rainwater dripped from the roof, hitting [Liu Jinxi] on the wrist holding the knife handle.
1:36:21|1:36:30|Realizing what it meant, [Liu Jinxi] widened his eyes.
1:36:38|1:36:42|After roaring, [Sect Leader] grabbed Xiaotian by the waist with one hand and lifted him into the air.
1:36:42|1:36:48|Seeing [Liu Jinxi] pulling out a big knife and charging towards him, he twisted his wrist and forcefully threw Xiaotian head down.
1:36:49|1:36:56|Just before hitting the ground, [Liu Jinxi] used the back of the knife to catch the falling forearm of [Sect Leader], leaving Xiaotian hanging upside down in mid-air.
1:36:57|1:37:6|Soon after, he flicked his wrist and with a quick slash, [Sect Leader] immediately shook off Xiao Tian. [A Yu] hurriedly caught him and rolled into a corner.
1:37:6|1:37:14|At this moment, [Liu Jinxi] slashed horizontally towards [Sect Leader]. After he dodged it, [Liu Jinxi] used the knife to push him into the bedroom on the side.
1:37:14|1:37:20|Then he knelt on one leg on the dining table, wielding a large knife to strike towards [Sect Leader] from left to right.
1:37:20|1:37:26|Unexpectedly, not a single blow landed, instead [Sect Leader] was able to support himself with one hand and deliver a direct kick to the neck.
1:37:26|1:37:34|After smashing the dining table, [Liu Jinxi] quickly stood up, wielding a big knife, and forced [Sect Leader] to the front door. What shocked everyone was,
1:37:34|1:37:40|After the blade struck the arm of [Sect Leader] completely, not only was he unharmed, but he also sent [Liu Jinxi] flying out.
1:37:41|1:37:45|At this moment, [Xu Baijiu] braved the heavy rain and quietly arrived near [Liu Jinxi]'s house.
1:37:45|1:37:51|In the room, after sending Liu Jinxi flying, Sect Leader opened his arms wide and smiled at him.
1:37:51|1:37:55|[Liu Jinxi] was panting heavily, with the big knife held horizontally in front of his chest.
1:37:55|1:38:1|At this moment, [Xu Baijiu] arrived outside the kitchen, and upon seeing the cellar, he lifted the wooden board and went down.
1:38:1|1:38:9|In the room, [Liu Jinxi] once again swung his big knife towards [Sect Leader]. Suddenly, he crouched down, the blade slanting upwards, hitting [Sect Leader] directly on the side waist.
1:38:10|1:38:18|Just like last time, not only did he not hurt him at all, but he was also fiercely flicked away by [Sect Leader] with a wave of his hand.
1:38:18|1:38:27|[Liu Jinxi] refused to believe in superstition, this time aiming the target at the throat of [Sect Leader]. Unexpectedly, when [Sect Leader] lowered his head, the blade was firmly wedged between his neck and chin.
1:38:27|1:38:32|Then, he swung the machete with one hand and fiercely punched Liu Jinxi's abdomen with the other hand.
1:38:33|1:38:40|At this moment, [Xu Baijiu] was watching from below through the wooden boards, and then he took out a needle.
1:38:40|1:38:46|On the other side, the hand of [Sect Leader] with many rings clenched tightly, then a fist fiercely smashed onto the cheek of [Liu Jinxi].
1:38:47|1:38:54|Continuing, [Liu Jinxi] was struck in the chest, causing him to crash through two door panels in succession, falling to the ground with the knife.
1:38:54|1:39:1|[Xu Baijiu] seized the opportunity and, through a gap in the wooden boards, a needle pierced directly into the bare foot of [Sect Leader].
1:39:2|1:39:6|The Sect Leader broke the wooden board bare-handed and pulled Xu Baijiu up by grabbing him with both hands.
1:39:8|1:39:15|Next, [Xu Baijiu] took the opportunity to insert three needles into the neck of [Sect Leader], and was then grabbed by the neck and thrown out of the room.
1:39:16|1:39:24|Then [Sect Leader] slowly turned around, looking at [Xu Baijiu] lying on the ground, with a strong push of his shoulder, he directly shook the needle flying out.
1:39:26|1:39:34|At this moment, [A Yu] hurriedly carried the frightened Xiaotian to the second floor. Hearing the sound of footsteps on the stairs, [Sect Leader] shifted his gaze to the rear.
1:39:34|1:39:40|[A Yu] had just locked the door and turned to carry Xiao Tian into the house when he was grabbed by [Sect Leader] through the door panel.
1:39:40|1:39:46|Seeing Xiaotian grabbing onto Liu Jinxi's clothes and not letting go, [A Yu] quickly hugged the child and stepped back.
1:39:47|1:39:50|The Sect Leader directly pulled the two and tore the door panel apart.
1:39:50|1:39:53|[A Yu] fell into a coma on the spot while protecting Xiaotian.
1:39:54|1:40:0|Finally, [Liu Jinxi] regained his senses, picked up the big knife and leaped forward, flying to the front of [Sect Leader].
1:40:0|1:40:8|In the narrow corridor that only allowed one person to pass through, he kept swinging the big knife, forcing [Sect Leader] away from the mother and son.
1:40:8|1:40:15|At this moment, the blade of [Liu Jinxi] scraped across the dragon-shaped necklace on the chest of [Sect Leader], leaving the first drop of blood in their fight.
1:40:15|1:40:21|Feeling the pain, he looked down at his chest and then raised his fists, facing [Liu Jinxi].
1:40:22|1:40:28|[Liu Jinxi] swung the knife, but it was caught by his opponent who then stomped on his wrist and kicked the knife away.
1:40:28|1:40:32|Continuing, a kick in mid-air, [Liu Jinxi] could only step back repeatedly.
1:40:33|1:40:38|Later, the two separated on either side of the corridor, assuming the same posture and attacking each other.
1:40:38|1:40:46|[Liu Jinxi] slightly bent his fingers and swiftly attacked the head and abdomen of [Sect Leader], but a single fist was no match for two palms.
1:40:46|1:40:52|[Sect Leader] separated Liu Jinxi's arm with his left hand, clenched his right hand into a fist, and swung it directly at his face.
1:40:52|1:40:59|Next, [Liu Jinxi] lowered his body and lunged towards [Sect Leader], but not only did he fail, he was also flipped over and struck hard on his left shoulder.
1:41:0|1:41:9|The Sect Leader then opened his palm and firmly grasped Liu Jinxi's severed arm, the pain causing him to immediately buckle his knees and slowly bend over.
1:41:9|1:41:12|But even so, [Sect Leader] still didn't let go of his hand.
1:41:12|1:41:19|Thick blood was continuously flowing from the wound. In the end, Sect Leader let go of him.
1:41:19|1:41:27|Continuing to relentlessly attack Liu Jinxi's neck, then kicking him away.
1:41:39|1:41:44|After speaking, [Sect Leader] lifted his foot and kicked [Liu Jinxi] onto the platform on the second floor.
1:41:44|1:41:48|The heavy rain hit Liu Jinxi's face, wiping away the blood at the corner of his mouth.
1:41:49|1:41:55|Seeing [Liu Jinxi] struggling to get up, [Sect Leader] bent down and stepped onto the platform from the house.
1:41:55|1:42:2|After walking up to him, she kicked him hard in the face, causing [Liu Jinxi] to fall directly into the vegetable garden on the first floor.
1:42:22|1:42:31|Just as [Sect Leader] was about to use his thumb joint to strike at the temple of [Liu Jinxi], [Xu Baijiu] jumped onto him and jabbed a needle into his neck.
1:42:31|1:42:36|Therefore, the punch that was originally meant for [Liu Jinxi] was delivered straight to [Xu Baijiu].
1:42:36|1:42:41|A sudden bolt of lightning struck down from the sky, heading straight towards [Sect Leader].
1:42:42|1:42:50|The person who was laughing suddenly had his head blown open, falling forward horizontally, landing directly in front of [Liu Jinxi].
1:42:51|1:42:59|[Liu Jinxi] looked up at him, who was smoking, then suddenly lost strength, leaned his head against the muddy ground, and closed his eyes.
1:42:59|1:43:18|On the other side, Xu Baijiu, who was flung away by the Sect Leader, lay paralyzed next to a sack in front of the house. He tugged at the corner of his mouth and followed his gaze. The Sect Leader had a clearly visible iron needle on the burnt sole of his foot, in addition to the needle just on his neck, which explained why he was struck by lightning.
1:43:19|1:43:26|At this moment, [Xu Baijiu] turned his head again and looked at [Liu Jinxi], the two of them smiled at each other, finally letting go of their worries.
1:43:26|1:43:28|The heavy rain is still pouring down,
1:43:28|1:43:36|They paid no attention to their soaked bodies, simply closed their eyes slowly. Then [Xu Baijiu] slowly turned his head back.
1:43:37|1:43:44|In front of him appeared the doppelganger. The doppelganger was holding an umbrella, dressed neatly, and looking down at him.
1:43:45|1:43:53|Suddenly, [Xu Baijiu] felt a sweet and fishy sensation in his throat, and in an instant, a sticky fresh blood flowed from the corner of his mouth.
1:43:53|1:44:0|It was only now that it became clear that blood was continuously gushing out from the lung area of his originally clean clothes.
1:44:1|1:44:10|With the rhythm of his breathing, blood was flowing continuously from the corners of his mouth, staining his clothes in front of him.
1:44:16|1:44:21|The case finally came to light, and [Xu Baijiu] thought to himself.
1:44:21|1:44:26|Liu Jinxi stood in front of Xu Baijiu with an umbrella, tears silently streaming down his face.
1:44:26|1:44:35|After sniffing, he smiled and nodded at him. Then [Xu Baijiu] slowly closed his eyes that had been forcefully propped open.
1:44:35|1:44:44|The glasses were gradually blurred by the rain, and seeing him like this, [Liu Jinxi] forcefully opened his eyes wet with rain.
1:44:44|1:44:51|Then he closed his eyes weakly. And so, accompanied by heavy rain, [Sect Leader], [Liu Jinxi], and [Xu Baijiu],
1:44:51|1:44:55|Maintained the posture of lying down, lying on one's side, and leaning against for a long time.
1:44:56|1:45:18|The scene shifts, and at this moment, the mosquito coil from the beginning of the film reappears. After the mosquito coil burns through the rope, the sound of the small iron ball dropping at the other end of the rope awakens [Liu Jinxi]. Following this, [Liu Jinxi] finishes washing up, picks up a jug of wine, pours three cups in front of the altar, and facing the flickering candlelight, he raises his right hand to his chest and bows deeply.
1:45:18|1:45:26|He then went to the tool room, took the file out of the water basin, and shook off the water. Xiaotian hurried over and unfolded the towel.
1:45:26|1:45:34|Then, [Liu Jinxi] wrapped the file with both hands and dried it, finally, he inserted the knife into the cowhide.
1:45:41|1:45:47|Seeing Xiaotian devouring his food, [A Yu] whispered a reminder. After the meal,
1:45:47|1:45:53|[Liu Jinxi] picked up the cowhide cloth with a file in it, put it in his backpack, and walked towards the woods.
1:45:53|1:45:58|Upon seeing [A Yu], who was originally washing dishes in the kitchen, she hurriedly caught up with him and called out to him.
1:45:59|1:46:6|[Liu Jinxi] turned around upon hearing this, blinked at [A Yu], and then [A Yu] cleared his throat and said.
1:46:7|1:46:16|After speaking, [A Yu] stared straight into the eyes of [Liu Jinxi]. Upon hearing this, [Liu Jinxi] was first stunned, then glanced at Xiao Tian playing in the vegetable garden behind her.
1:46:17|1:46:26|Then he pursed his lips, blinked his eyes, smiled at her, turned around, picked up his straw hat, and walked towards the depths of the forest.
