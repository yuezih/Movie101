0:0:49|0:0:56|At the beginning of the film, in an upscale Western restaurant, a lady casually twirls the noodles on her plate with a fork.
0:1:11|0:1:18|The head chef nodded, and the lady invited him to taste. The chef picked up a piece of smoked sausage with a fork and put it into his mouth, while the lady continued to ask.
0:1:22|0:1:25|The woman questioned, turning to the few people dining with her.
0:2:9|0:2:14|The lady proudly took a deep breath and then looked up at the chandelier not far above.
0:2:19|0:2:21|Everyone looked up.
0:2:33|0:2:40|The head chef personally instructs the waiter beside him.
0:2:40|0:2:42|The waiter brought a ladder and climbed up carefully.
0:3:6|0:3:7|Everyone shook their heads.
0:3:9|0:3:14|The light spots reflected on the plate disappeared as it tilted forward and backward.
0:3:14|0:3:16|The head chef suddenly realized.
0:3:28|0:3:32|Li Meiling waves her hand nonchalantly.
0:3:32|0:3:35|The head chef bowed and left, leaving [Li Meiling] sitting proudly.
0:4:9|0:4:13|[Cheng Yumeng] smiled sweetly, and after the meal, everyone prepared to leave.
0:4:22|0:4:23|A luxury business car pulls up.
0:4:27|0:4:29|Cheng Yumeng elegantly got into the car.
0:4:32|0:4:44|In the business car, Cheng Yumeng turned her head to look at the people outside the restaurant getting further and further away. She then wearily closed her eyes and leaned back in her seat to rest.
0:4:56|0:5:0|[Cheng Yumeng] opens her wallet, inside there are only a few hundred yuan.
0:5:3|0:5:11|He hands the money to the driver.
0:5:11|0:5:16|He leaned back in his seat again, closed his eyes to rest, but his heart felt as if it were being crushed by a stone.
0:5:18|0:5:26|Before long, he opened his eyes and looked out the window. The colorful lights of the city at night reflected on his face in patches.
0:5:26|0:5:34|In the subway station, [Cheng Yumeng] inserted a few coins to purchase a subway ticket, and her backpack slowly passed through the luggage security machine.
0:5:34|0:5:43|He took his backpack, checked his ticket, and walked up the stairs to the waiting area.
0:5:43|0:5:44|A train pulls into the station.
0:5:47|0:5:58|He stepped into the less crowded late-night subway, sat down expressionless, and the doors closed.
0:5:58|0:6:4|After getting off the subway, he arrived at the convenience store and bought a few skewers of oden with a dozen coins.
0:6:4|0:6:14|Later, he walked slowly and wearily back home, the high heels tapping on the pavement. There were few vehicles on the road, and under the dim lights, only [Cheng Yumeng] was seen.
0:6:16|0:6:23|Under the residential building, the dark alley is lined with bicycles, and someone is pushing a bicycle away.
0:6:23|0:6:37|He walked into the residential building, passed through layer after layer of dim staircases, walked past the hearth by the corridor, and returned to his own room.
0:6:37|0:6:40|Turn on the light, take out the key, and close the door.
0:7:18|0:7:21|The chief editor stopped directing the staff to shoot and walked forward.
0:7:21|0:7:23|The editor-in-chief glared at the employee eating instant noodles.
0:7:23|0:7:27|A boy is handing breakfast to a girl, and the editor-in-chief lifts their office desk slightly.
0:7:44|0:7:49|Upon entering the editor-in-chief's office, the editor first flipped over the first sheet of paper on the whiteboard, revealing many photos recorded on it.
0:7:49|0:7:51|Looking at these photos, [Cheng Yumeng] let out a smile.
0:8:48|0:9:3|You suddenly tell me to go to Nepal. Even if you describe the place so well, isn't the gap too big? The editor-in-chief, expressionless, looked at Cheng Yumeng, then put down the biscuit in his hand and stood up.
0:10:3|0:10:13|The editor pointed to the four big characters on the whiteboard, "I am very happy," and then walked to the table and opened a can of Red Bull.
0:10:18|0:10:21|He took a sip of Red Bull and continued speaking.
0:11:3|0:11:14|[Cheng Yumeng] gave a sweet smile to the editor-in-chief, but the next second she put away the smile, showing a sense of loss and helplessness, turning around to look at the four big words "I am very happy".
0:11:14|0:11:19|The day of departure has arrived. Inside the airport terminal, several older sisters from the tour group are eating oranges and chattering.
0:11:31|0:11:35|Cheng Yumeng walked to the airport bookstore with disgust and picked up a book to read.
0:11:35|0:11:39|At the airport exit, the tour group leader pointed at the sign for the "Journey of Happiness" and waited.
0:11:39|0:11:46|[Wang Can] pushed his luggage out, looking drunk, shaking his phone and greeted the team leader.
0:11:50|0:11:55|The older sisters placed their luggage in the trunk of the tour bus and then hurriedly got on board.
0:11:55|0:12:5|When Naji got into the car and pushed the door, she accidentally pinched the foot of [Wang Can] who was lying on the seat, causing him to wake up groggily.
0:12:5|0:12:13|[Wang Can] casually grabbed a short-haired girl who had just gotten on the car.
0:12:13|0:12:17|The girl took out a towel from her bag, got off the car, and poured the mineral water in her hand onto the towel.
0:12:55|0:12:58|[Cheng Yumeng] glanced at everyone, showing displeasure towards [Wang Can].
0:12:58|0:13:9|The enthusiastic [Restaurant Girl] kept her head down, looking at her phone. Inside were photos of Nepal, with captions like serene and profound, temple spiritual power, and Buddha light enveloping.
0:13:9|0:13:12|The look in [Restaurant Girl]'s eyes reveals her anticipation for this journey.
0:13:13|0:13:19|During the bus ride to transfer to the plane, [Restaurant Girl] kept browsing everything about Nepal on her phone.
0:13:19|0:13:34|In the blink of an eye, they had arrived at Kathmandu International Airport.
0:13:34|0:13:37|The tour guide Laxin kept waving a piece of paper with "Happy Journey" written on it.
0:13:42|0:13:49|The journey of happiness begins here, as [Cheng Yumeng] opens her QQ space and writes in her post.
0:15:12|0:15:20|[Wang Can] walked out of the shop that the two had just passed, he looked at the two walking ahead with a disdainful expression, then turned and walked in the opposite direction.
0:15:24|0:15:30|Tour guide La Xing stood in front of a statue at Duba Square.
0:15:30|0:15:35|The elder sisters played with hundreds of pigeons in the square, while Cheng Yumeng led the tour group, explaining as they walked.
0:15:41|0:15:48|Li Meiling takes photos with her phone, capturing the monks, foreign tourists, and Buddha statues that make up this place.
0:15:48|0:15:55|Photography enthusiasts in the tour group aimed their DSLR cameras at local children and various unique features, snapping away frantically.
0:15:55|0:15:57|Cheng Yumeng wrote in the unreliable travel companion group.
0:16:5|0:16:9|Everyone visited local jewelry stores, clothing stores, and street vendors.
0:16:9|0:16:20|[Cheng Yumeng] walked on the street, watching the people coming and going, when an old man passed by and locked eyes with him.
0:16:44|0:16:57|The next day, the journey continued. [Wang Can] tried on various gloves, while [Cheng Yumeng] stood in the middle of the street holding a map, frowning as he watched the traffic and people passing by. He sighed and put down the map, then looked up at the sky.
0:16:57|0:17:3|In the afternoon, Cheng Yumeng led everyone to a hotel courtyard, where they left their shoes and luggage on the entrance carpet.
0:17:18|0:17:26|[Wang Can] also arrived at the entrance. He didn't take off his shoes and just stepped over everyone's shoes and luggage.
0:17:26|0:17:31|Everyone sat down on the cushions one by one, crossing their legs, occasionally making the sound of bones folding.
0:18:0|0:18:5|La sat cross-legged next to the master, translating for everyone.
0:18:21|0:18:23|[Cheng Yumeng] is absent-minded.
0:18:34|0:18:44|Laxin leaned in and whispered to the Zen master, who nodded with a slight smile.
0:18:44|0:18:46|Laxin puts his hands together.
0:18:48|0:18:52|Cheng Yumeng nonchalantly pursed her lips, while the Zen master noticed Wang Can.
0:19:29|0:19:33|In the memory, [Wang Can]'s father and his friends reached an agreement at the golf course.
0:19:59|0:20:1|[Wang Can] walks in the yard while talking.
0:20:11|0:20:18|He placed both hands on the monk's shoulders, with only one thing in mind, to pull his heart and move his hands away.
0:20:51|0:20:59|Laxin pushed [Wang Can] back to the cushion and sat down, then hurried back to the side of the Zen master, clasped his hands together, bowed, and then knelt down to continue translating for the Zen master.
0:21:4|0:21:13|In the memory, at Wang Can's wedding, the bride is entering with her father. The invitation reads, "Whoever comes is a true friend."
0:21:13|0:21:24|The flower girl joyfully scattered petals in front, but as the bride entered, she saw [Wang Can]'s ex-girlfriends all dressed in black, sitting in a row, glaring at her.
0:21:24|0:21:30|The bride looked displeased, just as [Wang Can] reached out a hand, the bride stopped and whispered to her father.
0:21:35|0:21:40|The choir members were also in a panic, at a loss, and the bride and father left like this.
0:22:13|0:22:18|At this moment, [Wang Can] sat down next to the Zen master and grabbed his hand.
0:22:51|0:23:2|The monk angrily pulled away his hand caught by [Wang Can], and demonstrated by placing his hand on his knee, then clasping his hands together.
0:23:22|0:23:36|[Wang Can] listened intently, by now the sky had darkened, a gust of wind blew out half of the candles placed in the courtyard, leaving only a few flickering. It was only then that [Wang Can] came back to his senses, and the next day they continued their happy journey under the guidance of Laxin.
0:23:42|0:23:45|It's the temple where the living goddess is worshipped in Nepal.
0:24:12|0:24:17|The chosen girl at the end made everyone worship.
0:24:17|0:24:20|During the holidays, they will even invite her out for a parade.
0:24:24|0:24:27|The origin of the goddess is presented in the animation on the screen.
0:24:27|0:24:34|When the little goddess grows up, her term will end, she will be given a sum of money, and then sent back to the mortal world.
0:24:40|0:24:43|But the goddess only accepts worship from Hindus.
0:25:24|0:25:31|It's [Wang Can]'s turn to look inside the house, and he turns to find Laxin.
0:25:31|0:25:42|[Cheng Yumeng] was also curious and frowned slightly as he overheard the conversation between [Wang Can] and Laxin.
0:25:42|0:25:47|Laxin and [Wang Can] suddenly started fighting in the courtyard, and members of the tour group rushed forward to stop them.
0:25:50|0:25:55|Everyone thought La Xing was bullying someone, so they helped [Wang Can] fight back, and [Cheng Yumeng] ran over quickly.
0:25:55|0:26:0|The two did not stop, the scene was chaotic.
0:26:0|0:26:3|Wang Can wanted to step forward, but Cheng Yumeng stood in front of La Xing.
0:26:12|0:26:15|Li Rexue was anxious on the side, and everyone looked at [Wang Can].
0:26:15|0:26:22|[Wang Can] was momentarily at a loss for how to respond. He walked to the side to calm himself down, then walked back and pointed at La Xing.
0:26:25|0:26:30|La Xing endured a breath and did not step forward. [Wang Can] walked to the side indignantly and sat down.
0:26:32|0:26:35|[Wang Can] tidied his hair, while the others looked at [Cheng Yumeng] in confusion.
0:26:39|0:26:49|Everyone turned in shock to look at [Wang Can], who still had a defiant look on his face.
0:26:49|0:26:57|Laxing's eye sockets were already red, but he still endured, trying hard to keep his expression dignified, gradually easing his anger.
0:26:57|0:27:1|He walked slowly towards the front.
0:27:1|0:27:4|La Xing looked at [Wang Can], then turned to look at the people in the tour group.
0:27:7|0:27:12|He slowly began to speak.
0:27:15|0:27:20|Everyone stood still, feeling embarrassed about their impulsive actions.
0:27:20|0:27:24|La Xing feels helpless about everyone's misunderstanding.
0:27:24|0:27:30|He turned around, stood up straight with his feet together, straightened his clothes, and then knelt down in front of the goddess temple.
0:27:32|0:27:41|Several people in the tour group looked ashamed, with Cheng Yumeng and Wang Can clasping their hands together, silently reciting something, and then one by one starting to kowtow.
0:27:41|0:27:55|[Wang Can] thought that La Xing's behavior was a bit exaggerated. Everyone felt helpless. Na Jie gestured to the people around her, and gradually everyone dispersed, leaving only [Li Meiling] looking at La Xing with reluctance, while [Cheng Yumeng] glared angrily at [Wang Can].
0:28:5|0:28:17|Laxin kept bowing repeatedly, slowly and forcefully, as if apologizing to the goddess for the commotion in the courtyard just now. This is the devout faith of Nepal, which tolerates no blasphemy.
0:28:18|0:28:23|The journey continues, with everyone sitting on the bus, their spirits not particularly high.
0:28:23|0:28:25|Outside the car, people holding flags can be seen marching.
0:28:25|0:28:27|The broadcast plays in the car.
0:28:39|0:28:45|The tour group climbed a long flight of stairs to reach the Monkey Temple on the western hilltop of Kathmandu, where monkeys were everywhere.
0:29:8|0:29:12|Many people were burning incense and praying, [Cheng Yumeng] and [Li Meiling] were resting on a high platform.
0:29:22|0:29:24|[Cheng Yumeng] smiled slightly.
0:29:34|0:29:37|[Cheng Yumeng] nodded, listening attentively.
0:29:41|0:29:43|Seeing the bag of blood raised by [Li Meiling], her boyfriend almost couldn't stand steady.
0:30:52|0:30:55|Innocent and passionate, guessed by [Cheng Yumeng].
0:31:2|0:31:5|But he still needs time to digest this.
0:31:6|0:31:9|Cheng Yumeng nodded with a worried expression.
0:31:32|0:31:40|Li Meiling stared at Cheng Yumeng with innocent eyes, while Cheng Yumeng gazed into the distance as if contemplating something, as if she had already seen through everything in her heart.
0:31:47|0:31:55|In the distance, densely packed buildings nestle at the foot of the mountain, and the temples around echo with the evening bells.
0:31:55|0:32:3|Behind them is a pagoda with a white tower body and a golden tower top, with four Buddha eyes on the tower body overlooking all sentient beings.
0:32:3|0:32:15|The pagoda is surrounded by a row of prayer wheels, with monks turning the prayer wheels clockwise while chanting blessings. Devout followers also gently touch the pagoda with their foreheads.
0:32:17|0:32:23|A bus is driving on a rural road, traveling from Kathmandu to Chitwan, a five-hour journey.
0:32:23|0:32:27|The car was crowded with passengers, and some seats were still occupied by luggage.
0:32:27|0:32:36|The camera pans up to the top of the bus, where many pieces of luggage are placed. Several people are sitting on the roof, holding onto the railings on both sides, including [Cheng Yumeng].
0:32:36|0:32:42|He stared blankly ahead as the bus swayed and bumped along the mountain road, the roof shaking violently.
0:32:43|0:32:48|Cheng Yumeng turned around and frowned at the woman sitting next to her, holding a child.
0:32:48|0:32:51|The woman who was originally lost in thought noticed her and smiled at her.
0:32:51|0:32:54|[Cheng Yumeng] also responded with a gentle smile.
0:32:54|0:33:5|After watching the boy being tightly embraced by his mother for a while, [Cheng Yumeng] gradually felt melancholic as memories flooded back.
0:33:30|0:33:35|At that moment, watching another family gathering in the restaurant, [Cheng Yumeng] couldn't hide her longing.
0:33:44|0:33:51|On the roadside, Cheng Yumeng was still lost in thought.
0:33:51|0:34:1|[Cheng Yumeng] gradually came to her senses, looked up at the distant sky, glanced at her watch, and saw a motorcycle approaching her from afar.
0:34:17|0:34:25|Cheng Yumeng arrived at the hotel, frowning at the animal specimens soaked in formalin in the lobby, which also displayed decorations such as rhinos and crocodiles.
0:34:25|0:34:32|[Cheng Yumeng] walked up to the second floor, looked down from the window, and saw an outdoor swimming pool below. At this moment, [Cheng Yumeng] was deeply troubled.
0:34:33|0:34:39|At night, the ceiling fan in the room is slowly spinning. [Cheng Yumeng] is on the phone with the editor, sitting on the edge of the bed and opening her laptop.
0:34:41|0:34:42|The editor-in-chief is attending a party in a formal dress.
0:38:14|0:38:19|Here, [Cheng Yumeng] sits on the bed, staring blankly at the title of the manuscript on the computer, shouting at the center of the world, I am so happy.
0:38:38|0:38:44|Suddenly, all the lights went out, leaving only the computer screen lit up, with darkness outside the room.
0:38:44|0:38:51|In the hole in the wall, the flames of two candles flickered as the wind blew. [Cheng Yumeng] cautiously walked towards the door with a flashlight.
0:38:51|0:38:53|She leaned out and shouted loudly.
0:39:0|0:39:3|"The surroundings were too quiet, and any movement was magnified."
0:39:4|0:39:18|He swept around with a flashlight, and in the distance, a toad was slowly hopping on a stone pillar. [Cheng Yumeng] cautiously moved forward, occasionally startled by noises from the trees, holding up the flashlight to inspect.
0:39:18|0:39:23|The surroundings were shrouded in darkness, enveloped by thick fog.
0:39:23|0:39:29|He walked timidly and nervously along the edge of the pool.
0:39:29|0:39:33|He closely watched the surrounding environment, his eyes filled with fear.
0:39:35|0:39:40|Suddenly, several toads jumped to his feet.
0:39:40|0:39:43|He took a few steps back.
0:39:43|0:39:49|He then noticed that along this road, by the pond at the edge of the swimming pool, there were frogs everywhere.
0:39:49|0:39:54|Some are lying on the ground, some are jumping around.
0:39:54|0:39:58|He dodged the toads and quickly ran towards the hotel lobby.
0:40:2|0:40:10|He observed the interior through the glass window from outside the hotel lobby, then walked to the door.
0:40:10|0:40:17|He tried to push the door open, but it was chained from the inside.
0:40:17|0:40:23|He kept calling for the tour guide, but no one answered. He stomped his feet in frustration and left.
0:40:23|0:40:27|[Cheng Yumeng] was scared and helpless, walking around the nearby alley in a daze.
0:40:29|0:40:34|Suddenly, he saw someone in a room lighting candles with a lighter, and then closing the curtains.
0:40:37|0:40:40|He ran to the door of this room and spoke from inside the room.
0:40:49|0:40:51|The people in the room looked at him with a candle in hand, then pulled the curtain closed.
0:41:10|0:41:22|He slowly turned around, helplessly crouching at the door, tightly gripping a flashlight.
0:41:58|0:42:3|While filling out the transfer form, I cried.
0:42:48|0:42:53|Shanghai is especially bright, with light everywhere.
0:43:25|0:43:28|She turned around and stood up again.
0:43:49|0:44:0|He poured out all his grievances here, when suddenly a bell caught his attention.
0:44:0|0:44:5|He turned around to look in the direction where the bell sound was coming from.
0:44:5|0:44:12|He walked into the woods, bowing his head to avoid the tangled branches and leaves.
0:44:12|0:44:16|He saw a row of copper bells hanging on the branches, swaying in the wind.
0:44:19|0:44:30|Under the tree branch, there is a small Buddha statue with five candles lit in front of it.
0:44:30|0:44:35|He looked at the statue of Buddha, tears falling down one by one.
0:44:35|0:44:41|The sound coming from afar startled [Cheng Yumeng].
0:44:41|0:44:44|A baby elephant emerged from the forest and slowly walked towards him.
0:44:47|0:44:55|This small elephant is not very big, a little taller than [Cheng Yumeng], with painted patterns on its forehead.
0:44:55|0:45:4|It stood still, staring closely at the baby elephant.
0:45:4|0:45:10|The little elephant slowly came to a stop in front of him.
0:45:10|0:45:17|He reached out and touched the baby elephant's forehead, then leaned his own head against it, gently touching the baby elephant's forehead.
0:45:26|0:45:40|At this moment, he gradually eased his fear, and in the darkness, the little elephant quietly stayed by his side.
0:45:40|0:45:49|The next morning, the owner of the baby elephant rode in front controlling the baby elephant, with [Cheng Yumeng] sitting in the structure on the back of the baby elephant, while KC walked on the ground.
0:45:51|0:45:57|They walked through the wilderness, passing by students on their way to school, and finally arrived at the riverside.
0:45:57|0:46:2|The baby elephant lies in the river, splashing water with its trunk and playing with [Cheng Yumeng].
0:46:4|0:46:10|[Wang Can] slipped from the elephant's back into the water, then scooped up water and splashed it onto the elephant.
0:46:10|0:46:15|Wang Can's hair was wet and shiny, she was as happy as a child.
0:46:15|0:46:19|Several local women washing clothes by the river also laughed at the scene.
0:46:19|0:46:29|She and Cheng Yumeng were playing with water by the river, then gently cuddling with the baby elephant, caressing the elephant's trunk.
0:46:29|0:46:34|At the entrance of the hotel lobby, tourists on a minibus are unloading their luggage in preparation for check-in.
0:46:38|0:46:50|[Wang Can] covered in mud, was dragged back to the hotel entrance by the alley.
0:46:50|0:46:57|The vehicles on the roadside kicked up dust as a red convertible drove towards the hotel.
0:46:57|0:47:3|A person stood in the back seat of the sedan, dust flying towards him, he turned his head to avoid it.
0:47:3|0:47:6|The sports car drove into the hotel through the swirling dust.
0:47:9|0:47:14|The man was lying on the back seat, slowly sat up, his head full of dust.
0:47:14|0:47:19|It turns out that this person is [Wang Can].
0:47:19|0:47:31|He jumped out of the car, took off his sunglasses, stomped his feet, and patted the back of his head.
0:47:31|0:47:38|[Cheng Yumeng] came out of the hotel lobby and saw [Wang Can] hesitate for a moment. [Wang Can] sneered and casually approached him.
0:48:11|0:48:17|During the day, they went into the forest to have tea, drink water, take a shower, and at night, when the host rang the bell, they all went home.
0:48:36|0:48:39|[Cheng Yumeng] was speechless and stopped in her tracks.
0:48:44|0:48:48|Cheng Yumeng glared at him and continued walking forward.
0:48:48|0:48:50|Wang Can laughed.
0:48:53|0:49:0|[Wang Can] angrily glanced at the group of water buffaloes being driven by the owner behind him, and then continued to follow them.
0:49:0|0:49:5|At sunset, Cheng Yumeng was always hurrying home with her water buffalo.
0:49:7|0:49:14|Next to two straw sheds, people lit a bonfire, musicians played local folk songs, and a peacock was displaying its feathers.
0:49:19|0:49:25|Local residents and tourists formed a circle, with a bonfire, musicians, and a peacock inside.
0:49:25|0:49:35|Some people were waving sticks, while the locals were playing flutes and drums, and everyone was moving their bodies to the rhythm.
0:49:35|0:49:40|[Cheng Yumeng] and [Wang Can] also joined in, and everyone showed a bright smile.
0:49:49|0:50:1|Night falls, a straw shed turned into a small bar, with a circular bar surrounded by tourists drinking and chatting. [Cheng Yumeng] is also sitting alone here, drinking and lost in thought.
0:50:1|0:50:8|[Wang Can] came over with a glass of wine and sat down next to [Cheng Yumeng], while KC on the other side of the bar asked everyone to pass their passports to the two of them.
0:50:21|0:50:29|The two of them picked up the wrong passports. [Wang Can] couldn't stop laughing when he saw the name on Cheng Yumeng's passport, leaving foreign tourists puzzled. Cheng Yumeng caught up with [Wang Can].
0:50:33|0:50:40|Cheng Yumeng snatched back the Edo-style umbrella and sat back at the bar, with Wang Can laughing and covering his stomach as he followed her.
0:51:0|0:51:8|I warn you, Cheng Yumeng angrily leaves the bar, sits down at a table in the grass, with Wang Can sitting next to her.
0:52:14|0:52:16|[Wang Can] looks proud.
0:52:17|0:52:21|Cheng Yumeng kicked over Wang Can's chair, pinning him underneath.
0:52:42|0:52:45|[Cheng Yumeng] stood on a stool and glared at him fiercely.
0:53:24|0:53:29|Cheng Yumeng stomped on a stool before finally releasing her foot and sitting down on the side.
0:53:29|0:53:40|[Wang Can] moved the chair away from him and sat up with a displeased look on his face, pointing at [Cheng Yumeng] with his finger, but not knowing what to say.
0:54:0|0:54:7|Cheng Yumeng still had tears on her face, Wang Can supported his waist and was about to leave, but then turned back.
0:55:27|0:55:30|At that moment, [Li Meiling] overturned things on the table.
0:55:36|0:55:38|She tore off the information on the wall.
0:55:51|0:55:54|Cheng Yumeng is a kind of monster in the Classic of Mountains and Seas.
0:55:54|0:55:59|It has the appearance of a human, but with a pair of very short wings.
0:56:5|0:56:9|[Cheng Yumeng] lives in [Cheng Yumin Country] Ridge, which is next to the mountain.
0:56:54|0:56:59|Cheng Yumeng, with tears in her eyes, slowly turned around and stood up, looking at [Wang Can].
0:57:16|0:57:18|After speaking, Cheng Yumeng left.
0:57:18|0:57:20|[Wang Can] stood still and watched him leave.
0:57:23|0:57:28|On the way back, there was a very narrow bridge over the river, surrounded by darkness.
0:57:28|0:57:33|[Cheng Yumeng] strides ahead, with [Wang Can] closely following behind with a backpack.
0:57:33|0:57:38|After crossing the bridge, they heard the sound of the bell on the water buffalo as they walked back along the same road.
0:57:38|0:57:41|Cheng Yumeng stopped in his tracks, and Wang Can noticed a water buffalo.
0:57:45|0:57:51|The night sky was filled with twinkling stars.
0:57:51|0:58:0|Cheng Yumeng seems to have lost her way, just like a water buffalo.
0:58:0|0:58:7|On the other side, [Wang Can] sat by the campfire, playing with a peacock feather in his hand, lost in thought.
0:58:12|0:58:21|In the hotel room, [Cheng Yumeng] kept looking at herself in the mirror.
0:58:21|0:58:24|She sat on the edge of the bed for a while, then turned off the light and went to sleep.
0:58:32|0:58:46|Before long, there was singing outside the house. In the darkness, [Cheng Yumeng] checked the time on her phone. It was 1 a.m. She turned on the light, got up, walked to the door, and pulled back the curtain, squinting sleepily as she looked outside.
0:58:46|0:58:55|After finding the source of the music, she opened the door, leaned out, and with one hand on her hip, spoke outwards.
0:59:3|0:59:12|In the swimming pool, a few people are playing in the snow. Two women by the pool are dancing to the music, and as they get closer, he calls out to these Indians again.
0:59:13|0:59:15|Finally, these Indians stopped and looked at her.
0:59:15|0:59:17|[Cheng Yumeng] politely asked.
0:59:19|0:59:21|The woman didn't understand, [Cheng Yumeng] added.
0:59:22|0:59:30|The woman still didn't understand why the man in the pool, and the man didn't understand either, as the old man sitting on the lounge chair lowered his voice.
0:59:30|0:59:35|[Cheng Yumeng] then turned and left. She returned to her room, drew the curtains, lay down, and covered herself with a blanket.
0:59:37|0:59:46|Just two seconds later, the music was turned up again, and the group of people cheered and celebrated, making even more noise.
0:59:46|0:59:53|[Cheng Yumeng] couldn't fall asleep with her face covered, so she reluctantly lifted the blanket off her face.
0:59:53|0:59:56|He angrily pulled back the curtain and came back to them again.
1:0:6|1:0:10|Others also mocked him, and he angrily walked away.
1:0:10|1:0:15|On the way, he saw [Wang Can] pause for a moment, then continued walking back to the room.
1:0:15|1:0:22|[Wang Can] also looked like he hadn't slept well, staggering towards the pool and bumping his head on a children's clothing hanging from the eaves.
1:0:24|1:0:27|Cheng Yumeng pulls down the curtain in a huff.
1:0:27|1:0:29|Wang Can arrived at the poolside.
1:0:29|1:0:31|The man in the water said.
1:0:34|1:0:39|Hearing a noise, [Cheng Yumeng] lifted the curtain and looked outside.
1:0:39|1:0:46|[Wang Can] walked past the woman who looked down on him, while a few Indians were still enjoying themselves.
1:0:46|1:0:51|At this moment, [Wang Can] strolled over pushing a cart.
1:0:51|1:0:54|The car was filled with piles of steaming cow dung.
1:0:56|1:1:0|The woman dodged the car with disdain.
1:1:0|1:1:8|Wang Can pushed the cow dung into the pool along with the car.
1:1:8|1:1:11|The man in the water quickly climbed up, and Wang Can turned around and walked back.
1:1:11|1:1:16|The Indian man was very angry, and [Wang Can] ignored them.
1:1:16|1:1:20|On the way back, [Wang Can] saw [Cheng Yumeng] staring at them in the room.
1:2:0|1:2:6|KC helped [Cheng Yumeng] put the luggage in [Wang Can]'s sports car.
1:2:6|1:2:12|[Wang Can] lay on the back seat, with his feet resting on the car body. [Cheng Yumeng] pushed his feet down.
1:2:12|1:2:15|Wang Can sat up, while Cheng Yumeng got into the car and sat in the back seat.
1:2:19|1:2:26|[Wang Can] continued to lie down, with his feet propped up behind [Cheng Yumeng].
1:2:26|1:2:28|[Cheng Yumeng] waved goodbye to KC.
1:2:28|1:2:39|Next to the street, the shops have closed. Someone is riding a motorcycle with a flag inserted at the back. Motorcycles are passing by them one after another, while [Cheng Yumeng] rests with his head supported by his hand, eyes closed.
1:3:48|1:3:52|I'll have Xiao Lin from the advertising department cover for you.
1:4:26|1:4:36|Xiao Chen, stop asking me for a sense of security all the time. Hang up the phone. [Chen Yumeng] looks particularly melancholy, driving the sports car on the road next to the farmland, where a long line of cars is already blocked ahead.
1:5:6|1:5:11|[Wang Can] struggled to sit up, then jumped out of the car from the side.
1:5:11|1:5:14|He furrowed his brow and looked curiously into the distance.
1:5:18|1:5:26|Many people were shouting and waving flags, men stood on tractors holding up flags, and women surrounded them or stood behind them.
1:5:26|1:5:32|Wang Can also came to them, stood in a higher position, raised his phone to shoot, and shouted along with them.
1:5:32|1:5:40|In the car, [Cheng Yumeng] put on headphones to listen to music, she opened her computer to start writing, with a serious expression.
1:5:40|1:5:43|She looked up in thought, but was distracted by a voice from the side.
1:5:47|1:5:58|In the side field, there is a bamboo swing set up, with two children happily swinging on it, while several girls are playing soccer in the field.
1:5:58|1:6:10|Watching the innocent children, [Cheng Yumeng] gradually smiled, but immediately fell into sadness.
1:6:10|1:6:12|She shook her head and continued to focus on writing.
1:6:19|1:6:25|On the other side, Wang Can was still having a great time in the crowd, taking selfies with many people using his phone.
1:6:25|1:6:34|At this moment, Cheng Yumeng's computer flashed a low battery warning and randomly went black. She became anxious and frustrated, hitting the computer and pulling off her headphones, looking into the distance.
1:6:34|1:6:43|She stood up on the car and a motorcycle with chess pieces drove past her.
1:6:43|1:6:46|On the distant bridge, vehicles were stuck in a traffic jam and unable to move forward.
1:6:49|1:6:55|Some women and children grew weary as they waited.
1:6:55|1:6:58|[Wang Can] and the driver returned, and [Cheng Yumeng] walked up.
1:7:4|1:7:11|[Cheng Yumeng] turned around and walked to the back of the car to open the trunk, preparing to take the luggage down, but was stopped by [Wang Can].
1:7:35|1:7:39|[Cheng Yumeng] frowned and turned around to look at [Wang Can] helplessly.
1:7:52|1:8:1|They then drove away from the traffic jam caused by the protest and took another route to go to Bokala.
1:8:1|1:8:5|At night, they lit a bonfire in the wilderness to rest.
1:8:10|1:8:14|There is no one in the desolate outskirts at night.
1:8:21|1:8:28|[Wang Can] used two suitcases opened and propped together to form a tent-like structure, then carefully crawled inside and lay down, with [Cheng Yumeng] wrapping a shawl around him.
1:8:44|1:8:47|[Wang Can] looked up at him defiantly, then slumped back down.
1:8:47|1:8:54|[Cheng Yumeng] sat by the tree, opened the suitcase covering her legs, and stared at the bonfire.
1:9:17|1:9:33|Wang Can turned to look at the sky, lost in thought. He opened the luggage placed together and then sat down next to [Cheng Yumeng].
1:10:35|1:10:40|[Cheng Yumeng] was speechless, leaning back against the tree with her eyes closed.
1:10:40|1:10:41|Wang Can could only leave uninterestingly.
1:10:44|1:10:54|At this moment, [Wang Can] put on a snake-shaped glove, hid behind the luggage and extended a hand, gesturing and speaking in sync.
1:11:9|1:11:11|He hid behind the suitcase again.
1:12:14|1:12:23|[Cheng Yumeng] couldn't help but lower his head and smirk on the suitcase, while Wang Can was energetically singing and dancing in front of him.
1:12:23|1:12:31|The night sky in Nepal is clean and clear, with stars shining densely above, and [Cheng Yumeng]'s tense nerves finally relax a bit.
1:12:39|1:12:54|The next day they continued on their journey, with Wang Can still singing loudly in the mountains.
1:13:16|1:13:20|At this point, they have bypassed the congested area and are only forty kilometers away from Bokara.
1:13:26|1:13:31|Outside of Bokala City, a long line of cars is stuck on the road between rural terraced fields.
1:13:31|1:13:36|The police are standing in formation in the far distance, armed with guns and shields.
1:13:36|1:13:43|Protesters also lined up in formation, holding signs and banners, shouting the words on the banners loudly, fighting for their dreams and securing their livelihoods.
1:13:46|1:13:51|[Cheng Yumeng] and [Wang Can] have successfully met up with the tour group and are also stuck here.
1:13:51|1:13:54|The photography enthusiasts in the group have been busy taking pictures to document.
1:13:54|1:13:59|Cheng Yumeng stops Laxin as he rushes back from a distance.
1:14:24|1:14:28|On the hillside in the distance, the older sisters in the tour group have been watching the protest scene in the distance.
1:14:30|1:14:35|Protesters are getting closer to the police, who are prepared with determined looks in their eyes.
1:14:38|1:14:42|[Wang Can] sat on the hilltop, looking out, and Laxin handed a can of Red Bull to [Wang Can].
1:14:42|1:14:49|Cheng Yumeng sat under the pavilion behind [Wang Can], and [Li Meiling] handed him a Red Bull.
1:14:49|1:14:53|Cheng Yumeng smiled and took over, with Li Meiling sitting next to him.
1:14:53|1:14:56|Suddenly, a group of people chanting slogans approached them.
1:14:56|1:15:1|[Li Meiling] quickly stood up and used her phone to record as this group of people handed out a small piece of paper to each person in the tour group.
1:15:10|1:15:14|Above is printed in English "Fighting for Dreams, Ensuring Life".
1:16:10|1:16:22|With Cheng Yumeng glaring at him with furrowed brows, the protesters have been shouting loudly in protest.
1:16:22|1:16:26|On a platform below the protest scene, children are happily kicking a soccer ball.
1:16:55|1:16:59|Cheng Yumeng's eyes were already red, and Li Meiling listened quietly, feeling a bit downcast.
1:17:32|1:17:44|At this point, the protesters became more agitated. Several men brought many rubber tires, lit them on fire in the middle, and threw them at the police.
1:17:44|1:17:48|The members of the tour group became tense, focusing on the distant protest scene.
1:17:52|1:18:2|Protesters pushed aside the iron wire barriers set up by the police and charged forward. The front row of police officers stood shoulder to shoulder, holding long sticks to block the protesters, while some confronted the police officers holding shields.
1:18:2|1:18:9|At this moment, two police officers knelt on one knee and fired smoke bombs into the sky, causing the protesters to retreat.
1:18:9|1:18:15|A group of protesters holding signs and banners passed by the tour group and ran towards the protest site.
1:18:15|1:18:17|[Wang Can] kept staring at them.
1:18:19|1:18:26|At this moment, the protest scene descended into chaos as protesters began to clash with the police.
1:18:26|1:18:35|Watching this scene, [Wang Can] crushes the Red Bull can in his hand, making the situation even more chaotic.
1:18:35|1:18:41|Wang Can angrily threw the can on the ground and then walked towards Cheng Yumeng.
1:18:49|1:18:53|[Wang Can] smiled, turned around, and took off his shirt, leaving only the vest inside.
1:18:53|1:18:59|He picked up a thick wooden stick from the ground and tied the shirt to one end of the stick, puzzling Cheng Yumeng.
1:19:7|1:19:10|[Wang Can] smiled slightly, then lit the shirt on the stick.
1:19:13|1:19:16|He raised the lit torch.
1:19:24|1:19:27|He turned and ran away.
1:19:36|1:19:38|Cheng Yumeng hands the bag to La Xin.
1:19:39|1:19:41|Following closely behind, [Li Meiling] excitedly ran forward.
1:19:49|1:19:53|Li Meiling also followed up.
1:19:53|1:20:0|Najie and the rest of the tour group didn't know what to do, and [Wang Can] had already rushed to the protest site with a torch.
1:20:0|1:20:7|The protester picked up fruits from the ground and threw them at the police before turning and running away. Some police officers subdued the protester, while [Wang Can] fiercely threw a torch towards the scene.
1:20:10|1:20:22|The police chased the protesters as panic spread around, and in the midst of it all, Cheng Yumeng hurried over to help a protester break free with Wang Can.
1:20:22|1:20:31|[Li Meiling] followed closely behind, a protester fell to the ground, clutching his waist in pain. [Li Meiling] ran through the crowd and squatted beside him, asking if he was okay.
1:20:33|1:20:40|Na Jie and the rest of the tour group arrived here one after another. They ran forward in the direction opposite to the police chase and made way for the protesters.
1:20:40|1:20:45|The man in front is stopping the police, while the woman in the back is helping the injured protester.
1:20:45|1:20:52|[Li Meiling] and La Xing helped the protester who had fallen to the ground, the banner dropped to the ground, and pairs of feet stepped on it.
1:20:52|1:20:57|Na Jie and others ran with the injured protester, with [Wang Can] running to the front.
1:21:0|1:21:5|The protester being supported was crying out in pain, and the scene was in chaos.
1:21:5|1:21:11|At this moment, the tour bus arrived at the scene, and the crowd watching the scene made way for the bus.
1:21:11|1:21:19|[Cheng Yumeng] stood at the door of the tour bus, leaning out with a Chinese national flag in hand, reaching towards the outside. The members of the tour group ran towards the bus.
1:21:26|1:21:35|Reluctant to leave, [Li Meiling] was carried by the men in the group to the bus, with Lala following behind. The bus slowly drove away.
1:21:35|1:21:41|[Cheng Yumeng] held up the flag while pulling Xin and [Li Meiling] leaned out of the window.
1:21:41|1:21:48|The protester ran past the car holding a flag, while [Wang Can] struggled to block between the police and the protesters.
1:21:48|1:21:53|Some tourists ran and climbed up the ladder at the back of the bus, leaving together.
1:21:55|1:22:0|Reporters on the scene were carrying cameras to record everything.
1:22:0|1:22:11|The bus pulled up next to [Wang Can].
1:22:11|1:22:14|[Wang Can] and everyone in the tour group boarded the bus.
1:22:14|1:22:17|The bus drove through the crowded crowd.
1:22:17|1:22:19|La Xing closed the door of the bus.
1:22:19|1:22:22|Some foreign tourists climbed onto the roof of the car.
1:22:22|1:22:24|Foreign tourists who didn't make it up followed the bus and ran.
1:22:27|1:22:34|In the evening, the news reported that today a few Chinese people led a group of foreign tourists safely through the protest demonstration site.
1:22:50|1:22:51|Everyone raised their glasses in celebration.
1:22:57|1:23:6|[Wang Can] came to the side of the drunken [Laxin], putting his arm around her shoulder.
1:23:6|1:23:10|Lily smiles shyly.
1:23:10|1:23:12|Li Meiling sits on the side editing information.
1:23:21|1:23:22|Na Jie walked into the middle of the crowd.
1:23:34|1:23:41|After clinking glasses and finishing the drink, [Wang Can] left the group and approached [Cheng Yumeng], who was sitting alone at another table, lost in thought.
1:23:41|1:23:44|[Cheng Yumeng] noticed him, and [Wang Can] put down his glass and sat down.
1:24:27|1:24:30|[Cheng Yumeng] smiled helplessly.
1:24:35|1:24:39|At this moment, Cheng Yumeng and Wang Can sat down at their table and started singing.
1:24:39|1:24:46|[Wang Can] drank the glass of wine, and the two of them looked at the older sisters. Na Jie stared at [Cheng Yumeng] singing happily.
1:24:46|1:24:51|[Cheng Yumeng] smiled and then Na Jie invited the men at the table to sing together.
1:25:3|1:25:11|When it was just getting light, the tour group, drunk and arm in arm, left the bar singing and making a commotion.
1:25:26|1:25:39|A row of houses sit by the side of Lake Feiwa, with the snow-capped mountains behind them appearing magnificent and beautiful in the light of the rising sun. The lake reflects the beautiful mountains, creating a stunning picture of the lake and mountains.
1:25:46|1:26:7|The snow-capped mountains were shining golden in the sunlight, as the sun gradually rose from behind the mountains. [Wang Can], carrying a large bag, ran to the outside of [Cheng Yumeng]'s room.
1:26:7|1:26:11|[Cheng Yumeng] opens the door outward, and [Wang Can] takes a few steps back.
1:26:23|1:26:28|[Cheng Yumeng] closed the door again.
1:26:28|1:26:38|[Cheng Yumeng] sat wearily on the bed, staring at the door with a look of disgust. He closed his eyes and lay down on the bed, but then got up to brush his teeth.
1:26:46|1:26:50|He put down his phone, opened the computer, and downloaded Xiaolin's manuscript.
1:26:50|1:26:56|The cover of the manuscript is the largest stupa in Nepal, still titled "Crying out at the center of the world, I am so happy".
1:27:0|1:27:15|Before long, two off-road vehicles were driving through the mountains. One of the vehicles had equipment on the roof. The vehicles first traveled on the main road, then turned onto a small mountain path, climbing uphill. The journey was bumpy, passing through the woods, and finally arrived at a flat plateau at the mountaintop and stopped.
1:28:6|1:28:10|Cheng Yumeng is helpless, while Wang Can looks aggrieved.
1:28:10|1:28:15|A foreigner placed their paragliding equipment next to [Wang Can], who then sat down on it.
1:28:18|1:28:25|He looked up at [Cheng Yumeng] in confusion, then gradually became despondent, and [Cheng Yumeng] couldn't help but grit his teeth.
1:28:31|1:28:34|Wang Can smiled broadly.
1:28:34|1:28:39|He stood up and shouldered his gear, looking at [Cheng Yumeng] who nodded at him. [Cheng Yumeng] smiled and followed him.
1:28:45|1:28:55|Arriving at the mountaintop for paragliding takeoff, [Cheng Yumeng] cautiously stands at the edge of the cliff, looking down towards the steep cliff bottom with a fearful expression on her face.
1:28:55|1:29:3|The foreigner helped [Wang Can] open the parachute and then shook hands and walked away.
1:29:3|1:29:8|Cheng Yumeng ran to his side.
1:29:9|1:29:20|[Wang Can] has already fastened the safety rope around his body. [Cheng Yumeng] turned around and took a few steps, looking into the distance, jumping a bit to relax his body.
1:29:20|1:29:30|[Wang Can] helps [Cheng Yumeng] put on the equipment, securing each connection of the safety ropes.
1:29:30|1:29:33|Cheng Yumeng held the safety rope in front of his crotch and looked down.
1:30:3|1:30:6|He turned to look at [Wang Can] sitting on the railing beside him.
1:30:9|1:30:11|Wang Can looked at him nonchalantly.
1:30:21|1:30:26|Cheng Yumeng is still nervous, while Wang Can looks at the wind vane beside him without moving.
1:30:33|1:30:38|Cheng Yumeng stood there blankly, with many images flashing through her mind.
1:30:38|1:30:44|The bustling and busy Shanghai, the white-collar workers rushing for work, the sleepless skyscrapers and streets at night.
1:30:44|1:30:50|The remaining balance on the bank card is dwindling, and the numbers on the meter are jumping up in frustration.
1:30:50|1:30:54|The pages of the calendar flip by, and the days pass by in repetition.
1:30:56|1:31:13|[Cheng Yumeng] gradually closed her eyes, the bustling and restless scene of the big city contrasting sharply with the tranquility of the mountain top beside her.
1:31:13|1:31:17|As the last page of the calendar falls, everything seems to return to calm.
1:31:22|1:31:27|The surroundings were silent, as if time had stood still.
1:31:27|1:31:33|[Cheng Yumeng] slowly opened her eyes and quietly looked at everything in front of her.
1:31:33|1:31:50|She let go of the tightly held safety rope, all fear had dissipated.
1:31:50|1:32:11|In the tranquil mountains, the small trees and wheat fields swayed gently. [Cheng Yumeng] looked up at the sky, and the camera slowly moved to behind her, showing only her hair being slowly blown by the wind.
1:32:17|1:32:31|The ripples appeared on the lake surface, the wind vane began to sway, the wheat swayed with the wind, the wind horse rode with the wind, and the wind grew stronger.
1:32:31|1:32:43|[Wang Can] looked at the wind vane, [Li Meiling] also gazed happily at the wind vane, with traces of wind blowing everywhere, and eagles soaring in the wind.
1:32:46|1:33:5|[Wang Can] and [Cheng Yumeng] ran forward with a tandem paraglider, the wind blowing the canopy open. They leaped into the air, with many paragliders soaring up. Below them were snow-capped mountains, rivers, valleys, and farmland.
1:33:5|1:33:10|The mountains and forests of my hometown exude a tranquil atmosphere.
1:33:27|1:33:38|At this moment, the scene shows people dancing around the bonfire, with happy children by their side, capturing the everyday life of the locals in Nepal and their innocent smiles.
1:33:43|1:33:51|Buffaloes lie in groups across the small river, while elephants and hippos stay quietly.
1:33:51|1:34:2|The most ordinary life of Nepalese residents is happiness.
1:34:10|1:34:16|The trip is over, [Cheng Yumeng] returns to her home country, dragging her luggage through the airport terminal.
1:34:17|1:34:22|[Cheng Yumeng] stopped, turned around, and [Wang Can] walked towards her from a distance.
1:34:22|1:34:28|[Wang Can] shook the cloth bag in his hand and then threw it to [Cheng Yumeng].
1:34:28|1:34:32|[Cheng Yumeng] caught it and looked at the cloth bag, then glanced at [Wang Can] with a puzzled expression.
1:34:33|1:34:36|[Wang Can] just waved his hand and turned away.
1:34:37|1:34:51|Cheng Yumeng looked at the bag, smiled, and then left.
1:34:51|1:34:57|Back at the residential building, she carried her heavy luggage up flight after flight of stairs.
1:34:57|1:34:59|Next to the stove in the aisle, the neighbor is cooking.
1:35:6|1:35:20|He opened the door, carried the luggage in, and then took out the key to lock the door.
1:35:20|1:35:27|He placed his luggage on the bed, ready to unpack, and noticed the cloth bag given by [Wang Can]. He picked it up and looked at it curiously.
1:35:33|1:35:43|Later, he came to the balcony, stood on a stool to hang something, and then walked into the room, quietly looking up at the balcony.
1:35:43|1:35:53|It turns out that the bell [Wang Can] gave him was a copper bell to guide the water buffalo home.
1:35:53|1:36:2|Looking at this bronze bell, [Cheng Yumeng] gradually smiled, as if this bronze bell would guide him in the right direction and he would never get lost again.
1:36:12|1:36:22|In the Western Xia era, herds of water buffalo roamed the wild, lounged by the creek, and followed the sound of bells towards home.
