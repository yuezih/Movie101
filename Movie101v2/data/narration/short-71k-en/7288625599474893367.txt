0:0:22|0:0:26|In the distance, a group of Japanese soldiers with sharp knives are slowly advancing through the muddy country road towards the distant village.
0:0:26|0:0:34|A military officer in boots stopped in front of a pile of soil, squatted down, picked up some dirt, and smelled it in front of his nose.
0:0:34|0:0:38|Looking thoughtfully towards the village not far away.
0:0:42|0:0:48|The men who received the order held long spears and knives, continuing to approach the village with malicious intent.
0:1:1|0:1:11|Qin Gui helped his brother up from the haystack, and his injured brother sat down inside it, tremblingly taking out a map of the attack from his arms.
0:1:11|0:1:11|In the distance, 
0:1:50|0:1:54|The Japanese soldiers have entered the village.
0:1:54|0:2:0|Erzhu put his injured brother in a basket and hung it on the beam to hide him.
0:2:10|0:2:30|A skinny younger brother accidentally hung himself on the beam, and the invaders in the village were closing in on them. The invaders who received orders quickly took action. A young invader came to the door, pushed it open, only to be greeted by a flock of sheep rushing out, knocking down several invaders.
0:2:48|0:2:50|The little [Japanese soldiers] who heard the shout were indeed tricked.
0:3:1|0:3:9|The [Japanese soldiers] fell for the trick of luring the tiger out of the mountain set by the two pillars, searching everywhere for him. However, the older brother from the Eighth Route Army, who was hidden by him, successfully evaded the capture of the [Japanese soldiers].
0:3:9|0:3:13|The scene shifts, and a neatly dressed man arrives at the headquarters of [Qin Gui].
0:3:20|0:3:26|Zuo Zuomu stepped in long boots, with a long sickle hanging from his waist, and walked slowly towards the commanding officer.
0:4:16|0:4:22|Silently, Qin Gui took off the musical instrument hanging from his waist and slowly placed each piece on the table.
0:4:22|0:4:30|Commander looked at the table full of musical instruments, then glanced at [Zuo Zuomu] Ichiro who kept taking out instruments from his body, shook his head, and felt so angry that he wanted to break the scythe in his hand.
0:4:30|0:4:38|With a loud roar, Commander Qin Gui forcefully twisted the long sickle in his hand, but the sickle remained undamaged. Upon hearing the sound, Zuo Zuomu suddenly looked up.
0:4:39|0:4:43|Commander awkwardly looked at him, waiting for his next move.
0:4:43|0:4:47|Unexpectedly, the next moment, he took out a musical instrument from his bag.
0:4:47|0:4:49|Commander finally sighed helplessly and said: 
0:5:0|0:5:6|Upon receiving the order, [Zuo Zuomu] turned around and left. The commander watched his departing figure, shaking his head helplessly.
0:5:6|0:5:16|In a house decorated with the character for "happiness", a neatly dressed man [Qin Gui] is meticulously sewing a pair of adorable tiger-head shoes, with slow and meticulous movements.
0:5:54|0:5:59|In the house, the couple heard the movement outside the door and looked up together towards the door.
0:5:59|0:6:8|[Qin Gui] released his wife [Ayin] and walked towards the door.
0:6:8|0:6:18|[Qin Gui] awkwardly smiled and said to the shopkeeper.
0:6:52|0:6:54|Qin Gui looked at the shopkeeper in horror.
0:7:53|0:7:59|Qin Gui, the fourth brother, sent someone to Da Wang the day before.
0:8:9|0:8:11|Qin Gui turned his head nervously and said.
0:8:13|0:8:19|After finishing speaking, he quickly walked to the cabinet and put the gun hidden in the Jianghuai River into the cabinet, then turned to [Ah Ying] and said.
0:8:27|0:8:32|Qin Gui, who forgot where the book was placed, nervously started rummaging through the cabinet.
0:8:55|0:9:1|With a tight grip on his right fist, he swings it fiercely, hitting the jaw near the ear.
0:9:18|0:9:25|Qin Gui, who was beaten into a daze, mumbled.
0:9:25|0:9:30|At this moment in front of the train station, [Qin Gui] with a determined look on his face is surveying the surroundings.
0:9:34|0:9:40|With a poker face, Qin Gui pretended to casually observe the surroundings.
0:9:40|0:9:50|[Qin Gui] arrived at the train station and, upon seeing the man on the street, spoke mysteriously.
0:9:50|0:9:53|Looking at the unresponsive man, he turned his head in confusion and patted his shoulder.
0:10:9|0:10:18|On the other side, the two men in the village who were talking about cotton were also looking for Qin Gui.
0:11:8|0:11:14|[Qin Gui] hit [Uncle Shunzi] on the head with the cotton bale on his back, causing [Uncle Shunzi] to curse and follow behind [Qin Gui] while holding his head.
0:11:14|0:11:21|In the blink of an eye, the two who were just looking for the Eighth Route Army with ulterior motives have now thrown themselves into the dangerous business of picking cotton.
0:11:21|0:11:30|One of them, with cotton stuck all over his head and a smile on his face, was bouncing the cotton happily, while the other stood on a rock, stepping on the cotton and swaying his hips to the rhythm of the bouncing cotton.
0:11:30|0:11:32|At the train station, [Qin Gui] is still repeating the code word over and over.
0:11:36|0:11:40|[Qin Gui] finished the password and could only smile awkwardly at the silly old man.
0:11:40|0:11:43|On the other side, Qin Gui and Zuo Zuomu arrived at a teahouse.
0:11:44|0:11:48|After Mr. Zhu defeated the Jin army.
0:12:32|0:12:43|After finishing speaking, Mr. [Uncle Shunzi] took out a book from the package, carefully opened it, picked up the instrument in front of him, and started playing. The two people in the audience cracked melon seeds, watching with great interest on their faces.
0:12:55|0:13:0|At the train station, [Qin Gui] is still searching for people on the street, walking up to a man and carefully sizing him up.
0:13:0|0:13:4|Seeing the man smile at him, [Qin Gui] quickly squatted down and said.
0:13:13|0:13:14|In the teahouse.
0:13:19|0:13:25|The storyteller pointed to the sky, and a loud rumbling sound was heard.
0:13:55|0:14:0|He opened his mouth and showed the small props inside to everyone, and then everyone finally relaxed.
0:15:17|0:15:25|The youngest sibling thought the storyteller's voice was impressive, so he stepped forward and gave a thumbs-up. Seeing this, the storyteller, feeling scared, spoke.
0:15:28|0:15:31|The crowd looked at each other in fear.
0:15:50|0:15:54|The old demon and [Uncle Shunzi] ran through the crowd, picked up something and ran towards the door.
0:15:54|0:15:57|As soon as he stepped out the door, he collided with the arriving Qin Gui.
0:15:57|0:16:0|Qin Gui, who was knocked down, weakly raised his head and said.
0:16:26|0:16:37|Uncle Shunzi got up and leaned against the door, looking out, and immediately saw the Japanese soldiers not far away. He was so scared that he quickly closed the door, turned his back to it, gasping heavily, and gesturing frantically.
0:16:49|0:17:1|During the conversation, the Japanese soldiers could no longer find the whereabouts of the crowded people. A Japanese soldier with a long spear entered the teahouse, walked towards the inner hall, and the crowded people hiding behind the table luckily escaped unharmed, crouching there without daring to make a sound.
0:17:4|0:17:11|Uncle Shunzi handed the club to the old monster, indicating tactics through sign language, as hiding here was not a solution.
0:17:11|0:17:16|Uncle Shunzi gestured to join them, then made the sound of a bomber flying over.
0:17:21|0:17:32|[Uncle Shunzi], [Qin Gui], and [Zuo Zuomu] saw the Japanese soldiers being fooled and lying on the ground. They stood up and let out a roar, grabbing nearby household items and charging towards the Japanese soldiers. In no time, they smashed the gun in the hands of the Japanese soldiers.
0:17:32|0:17:40|Qin Gui, Zuo Zuomu, and Uncle Shunzi started playing "Capture the King around the Pillar" with the Japanese soldiers who had lost their guns. Dodging and weaving around the pillar, they moved left and right, creating a momentary stalemate.
0:17:41|0:17:45|Suddenly, the Japanese soldier made a feint and ran towards the wall, passing the three of them.
0:17:45|0:17:49|Fortunately, [Uncle Shunzi] was quick-witted and ran over to open the door for the invaders.
0:17:49|0:17:55|On the other side, Mr. [Storyteller] tenderly touched the musical instrument that had been knocked onto the table.
0:18:1|0:18:4|The Storyteller responded with a sound and ran towards Uncle Shunzi.
0:18:25|0:18:36|The Storyteller, running around frantically, was panting heavily and looked around before saying.
0:18:36|0:18:49|Uncle Shunzi continued to fight with the Japanese soldiers across from him after finishing speaking. He blocked and pushed with a wooden board, causing a Japanese soldier to punch the board and cry out in pain. Just as he was about to swing his knife at Uncle Shunzi, he was knocked down by Uncle Shunzi in the next second.
0:18:58|0:19:4|The moment after [Qin Gui], who had just finished speaking harshly, threw the club out, it hit the head of the Japanese soldier who was fighting with [Uncle Shunzi].
0:19:13|0:19:24|The Japanese soldiers in front of [Lao Yao] suddenly ran out, only to be slapped by [Uncle Shunzi] and landed straight on one end of the bench, pushing up the other end where another soldier was hanging on a hook on the ceiling.
0:19:24|0:19:29|The three of them looked at the bizarre scene in front of them, their mouths wide open in astonishment.
0:19:34|0:19:40|Uncle Shunzi, wearing a Japanese soldier's hat, stood with his back to the board and waved his hand. Seeing this, the Japanese soldier turned and walked outside. [Ma Dongmei] turned to Uncle Shunzi and said.
0:19:49|0:19:56|Uncle Shunzi grumbled and reluctantly stood up.
0:19:56|0:20:9|Uncle Shunzi had no choice but to walk to the window, looked up, and found that he was too short to see anything. He looked around and saw the Japanese soldier lying under the stool at his feet. He kicked him away and stood on the stool to look outside.
0:20:9|0:20:17|[Qin Gui], Uncle Shunzi said, unexpectedly, the Japanese hanging from the roof suddenly fell down.
0:20:23|0:20:29|The newly arrived Qin Gui was deceived by Uncle Shunzi again, sitting on the ground waving his hands constantly, not daring to rest for a moment.
0:20:29|0:20:45|And over here, [Uncle Shunzi] is still hanging on the roof.
0:20:45|0:20:49|Seeing Uncle Shunzi falling down, Qin Gui not only did not reach out a hand, but also covered his eyes.
0:21:21|0:21:27|Qin Gui, weakly leaning against the wall, gasping for breath, struggled to speak.
0:21:37|0:21:45|Ah, there are enemies everywhere outside. Uncle Shunzi looked at Erzhu leaning in his arms, and spoke with a determined expression.
0:22:0|0:22:9|The storyteller glanced at Erzhu and then at [Lao Yao], and began to speak.
0:22:9|0:22:15|After the storyteller finished speaking, he handed the two pillars in his arms to Uncle Shunzi and turned to walk away.
0:23:3|0:23:8|[Qin Gui] and [Uncle Shunzi] had just left the house when they were chased by bandits.
0:23:8|0:23:12|The two of them ran to the corner and temporarily shook off the pursuit of the ghost thieves.
0:23:43|0:23:47|The two of them fled clumsily and frantically with two guns in their arms.
0:23:47|0:23:51|The Japanese soldiers behind them kept shooting, as if the two were invincible.
0:23:51|0:23:57|In the hail of bullets, the two of them were unscathed, as each bullet was blocked by the wooden board carried by [Uncle Shunzi].
0:23:57|0:24:0|The Japanese soldiers watched helplessly as the wooden board was struck, sparking with fire.
0:24:43|0:24:48|The [youngest brother], who had escaped the pursuit, had his location exposed by a sudden shout from [Uncle Shunzi].
0:24:48|0:24:57|The Japs heard the sound and rushed over. [Uncle Shunzi] and the alliance ran down the path, followed by a swarm of Japs.
0:24:57|0:25:6|On the other side, Uncle Shunzi finally managed to shake off the person, just breathed a sigh of relief, but unexpectedly, around the corner, he ran into a Japanese soldier head-on, walking right into trouble himself.
0:25:6|0:25:9|The Japanese soldier looks at [Uncle Shunzi].
0:25:18|0:25:24|Uncle Shunzi pointed casually, only to find that he had just pointed to the arriving Qin Gui.
0:25:24|0:25:28|The enemy immediately raised his gun, and the next second he was knocked down by [Uncle Shunzi] with a punch.
0:25:38|0:25:45|The two of them successfully escaped in the carriage, while on the other side, Zuo Zuomu was still observing with a telescope.
0:25:56|0:26:1|A Japanese devil came from a distance, carrying a young man who was picking cotton on his back.
0:26:1|0:26:6|Zuo Zuomu hurried forward when he saw the huge creature in front of him.
0:26:6|0:26:12|Approaching Zuo Zuomu, Qin Gui looked left and right, and even tried a few moves himself.
0:26:50|0:26:58|[Qin Gui] quickly turned his head to look at the ground, and gave a cold glance at [Uncle Shunzi].
0:26:58|0:27:6|[Uncle Shunzi] suddenly jerked the whip, causing [Qin Gui] to lose his balance and fall off.
0:27:6|0:27:8|Uncle Shunzi finished speaking and then chased after him while holding his butt.
0:27:8|0:27:15|In the blink of an eye, the two arrived at the train station. In the bustling crowd, only [Uncle Shunzi] and [Youngest Brother] were wandering around like flies.
0:27:23|0:27:25|[Qin Gui] suddenly appeared behind the two.
0:28:2|0:28:11|[Qin Gui] had just finished speaking when he turned his head and saw [Uncle Shunzi] hurrying over. After sizing him up, he spoke.
0:28:20|0:28:23|Qin Gui excitedly rushed to the Storyteller.
0:29:10|0:29:20|The invaders stormed into the train station carrying artillery, initiating a continuous bombardment towards the crowd. The civilians were thrown into chaos by the shelling, scrambling to grab their luggage and flee for their lives.
0:29:20|0:29:32|In the midst of the gunfire-filled train station, [Qin Gui] ran while taking off his long robe, dodging the flying shells, panting heavily as he chased after [Uncle Shunzi] ahead. On the other side, [Zuo Zuomu] ordered the attack on the crowd.
0:29:52|0:29:58|The explosion sounded, the soil on the ground splashed, and smoke filled the air, then dissipated.
0:29:58|0:30:1|Uncle Shunzi and Zuo Zuomu appeared, their faces covered in dirt from the bombardment.
0:30:1|0:30:11|Uncle Shunzi turned his head and looked at Mr. Zuo Zuomu, who had already dodged the bomb and was running into the distance. He pointed with his finger and said.
0:30:21|0:30:38|Upon hearing Zuo Zuomu's command, the two invaders quickly loaded ammunition in preparation to shoot, but to their surprise, the next moment they made a mistake and the bomb fell straight down towards themselves. On the other side, Qin Gui and Uncle Shunzi climbed up the terraced fields with great difficulty, panting heavily from exhaustion, finally catching sight of the storyteller who was drinking water.
0:30:41|0:30:45|Upon hearing the sound, Mr. [Uncle Shunzi] turned around and spat a mouthful of water directly onto [Lao Yao]'s face.
0:31:7|0:31:18|The three people who were talking suddenly heard the buzzing sound of an airplane. [Qin Gui] pinched open the mouth of [Uncle Shunzi] to see if it was him making the sound.
0:31:25|0:31:27|[Qin Gui] walked up to [Uncle Shunzi] with his head held high.
0:31:48|0:31:54|In the next moment, a shell landed not far from the two of them, but they managed to escape in time by lying down.
0:31:54|0:32:0|Before the two could catch their breath, another shell streaked across the sky, and the group of people covering their ears waited for the shell to land.
0:32:0|0:32:7|After a loud noise, it turned out that what fell was not a shell. Mr. [Uncle Shunzi] in the house turned his head and looked outside the door.
0:32:16|0:32:22|Crouching outside the door, [Qin Gui] and [Uncle Shunzi] moved in unison, kneeling on the ground, slowly stepping back.
0:32:22|0:32:25|And behind them, arriving late, is [Qin Gui].
0:32:25|0:32:32|[Qin Gui] came running over, panting heavily, and stopped in front of the two people who were crawling backwards with their buttocks raised.
0:32:53|0:33:3|The storyteller inside the house was shaking the window hard trying to get out, while Qin Gui was also imitating Uncle Shunzi and Little Yao's movements, lying on the ground, sticking his butt out and stepping back step by step.
0:33:3|0:33:8|Stepping back to a certain distance, the three of them looked at the bomb in the distance and slowly stood up.
0:33:8|0:33:16|Qin Gui touched his pants and pulled out a gun from the pocket, aiming it forward. Uncle Shunzi turned his head and quickly knocked the gun away.
0:33:28|0:33:36|The old demon and Qin Gui, who were cursing each other as traitors, were pulling each other's ears. Seeing the two fighting, [Uncle Shunzi] picked up the gun on the ground.
0:34:12|0:34:19|Just as [Uncle Shunzi] rescued [Uncle Shunzi], he suddenly smelled smoke and looked up at the shells, laughing.
0:35:2|0:35:10|Seeing the densely packed devils below the mountain, Lao Yao finally reacted, shouting and running up the mountain. Nan [Qin Gui] glanced down and shouted.
0:35:26|0:35:38|With a deafening roar, the shells exploded down the mountain, engulfing the Japanese soldiers in a cloud of dust and debris, leaving them covered in soot and dirt.
0:35:38|0:35:40|Zuo Zuomu looked up and shouted.
0:35:44|0:35:49|At the command, the little devils below the mountain picked up their weapons and continued to launch an attack towards the mountain.
0:35:49|0:35:53|The old demon and his companions, without any weapons, were chased and fled in panic.
0:35:53|0:36:0|At this moment, [Uncle Shunzi] turned around, making machine gun noises with his mouth, wrapping the gun in his clothes and aiming at the Japanese soldiers.
0:36:0|0:36:9|After a burst of gunfire, he bundled up his clothes again, imitated the sound of a hand grenade, and threw the clothes at the Japanese soldiers. His actions were as fierce as a tiger, leaving [Qin Gui] speechless with astonishment.
0:36:21|0:36:29|However, Uncle Shunzi was also waving the gun around, but didn't manage to fire a single shot. In the next second, he casually threw it and hit Zuo Zuomu.
0:36:32|0:36:49|Zuo Zuomu, who was hit in the foot, held his foot and spun around. Seeing this, Qin Gui suddenly realized, quickly squatted down to pick up the gun, and threw it straight ahead. It hit another Japanese soldier's foot directly, now two people were spinning around holding their feet.
0:36:49|0:36:53|Even when everyone had run away and no one was holding a gun, he turned around and picked up the gun.
0:36:57|0:37:1|[Aying], who was a step behind, failed to keep up with the others and ran in the wrong direction.
0:37:20|0:37:24|Uncle Shunzi opened his mouth wide in shock, then quickly lay down, but as he did, he happened to lie right next to the hand grenade.
0:37:44|0:37:53|The Japanese soldiers went to chase the old demon and the others, while [Uncle Shunzi] remained crouched in place, staring at the hand grenade beside him with his mouth open. When the Japanese soldiers moved away, he slowly inched forward.
0:37:53|0:38:7|On the other side, the three of them had already run into the village. Qin Gui and Uncle Shunzi knocked on the door desperately, then ran towards the haystack on the side to find a place to hide.
0:38:7|0:38:9|Qin Gui and Zuo Zuomu followed, but they did not see the old demon's figure.
0:38:12|0:38:18|Finally, Mr. [Uncle Shunzi] walked over and saw that both of them had fallen into the cellar together.
0:38:55|0:39:0|The Japanese soldier was knocked unconscious by the Storyteller coming down the stairs with a rifle butt.
0:39:25|0:39:29|In the cellar, the old demon suddenly pointed a gun at [Qin Gui] and said.
0:39:42|0:39:49|Shh, the [Storyteller] stopped the two of them and slowly walked towards the cellar, looking up and observing. The old demon spoke.
0:40:5|0:40:11|Above the cellar, two Japanese soldiers are playing around a haystack, chasing a chicken at the cellar entrance.
0:40:11|0:40:14|In the cellar, the three people looked at the Japanese soldiers above, trembling in fear.
0:40:14|0:40:17|Fortunately, at a critical moment, the Japanese soldiers were called back for dinner.
0:40:17|0:40:25|The three in the cellar breathed a sigh of relief as they saw the Japanese soldiers leave. Feeling the crisis had passed, [Uncle Shunzi], who had just been holding onto [Qin Gui]'s old waist, pushed him away.
0:40:25|0:40:29|[Qin Gui] also disdainfully patted the shoulder that had just been touched by the old waist.
0:40:29|0:40:30|The Storyteller spoke.
0:40:59|0:41:2|Upon hearing this, Qin Gui and Zuo Zuomu coldly let go of each other's hands.
0:41:2|0:41:5|The old demon touched his ear and sat down by the wall, looking aggrieved.
0:41:5|0:41:7|The storyteller spoke up and asked.
0:41:33|0:41:41|In a moment of emotional turmoil, [Qin Gui] held the small shoe in his hand, thinking of his wife at home with a face full of sorrow, slowly raising his head to look into the distance.
0:42:45|0:42:58|I haven't counted, but there are definitely Japanese people. The scene shifts, and the village is surrounded by villagers. In the cellar on the other side, [Qin Gui], with grass shavings on his head, lies on the ladder, his big eyes focused intently on the situation outside.
0:43:30|0:43:44|The falling Japanese soldier was blocked by a sneaky elbow from [Qin Gui].
0:43:44|0:43:48|Qin Gui immediately stopped and turned around to look around when he heard the old demon speaking.
0:43:52|0:43:57|The scene shifts, and [Qin Gui] has changed into the clothes of the Japanese soldiers, struggling to emerge from the cellar.
0:43:57|0:44:4|Then, he carefully observed the surroundings and saw that there were no Japanese soldiers around the cellar, so he slowly climbed out.
0:44:4|0:44:7|He stood up and looked around from left to right.
0:44:7|0:44:11|The next moment, when he looked down, he found that his pants were not fastened properly, and [Qin Gui] turned around to adjust his clothes.
0:44:28|0:44:34|The falling Japanese soldier was immediately pinned to the ground.
0:44:34|0:44:39|On the other side, [Qin Gui] carried a bundle of firewood and walked forward nervously.
0:44:48|0:44:53|[Qin Gui] took the chicken handed to him by [Zuo Zuomu] and started eating it mouthful by mouthful.
0:44:53|0:45:1|After finishing eating, Qin Gui wiped his oily mouth and raised his arm, then answered.
0:45:1|0:45:3|The [youngest sibling] who changed clothes was called over by the two.
0:45:11|0:45:21|[Qin Gui] stuffed the chicken into [Uncle Shunzi]'s mouth while talking, and [Uncle Shunzi] walked away with the chicken in his mouth looking bewildered.
0:45:21|0:45:26|Upon hearing Zuo Zuomu calling his name, Qin Gui reluctantly glanced at Uncle Shunzi and slowly walked in.
0:45:49|0:45:53|On the other side, the shopkeeper Chen [Qin Gui] was not at home, quietly crouching at his doorstep.
0:45:53|0:45:57|[Qin Gui] opened the door, and the shopkeeper who was leaning against it fell straight to the ground.
0:46:12|0:46:18|[Aying] knocked her down with one punch, causing the door frame to weep.
0:46:39|0:46:45|[Aying] looked into the distance with tears streaming down her face.
0:46:45|0:46:51|In the distance, [Qin Gui] seemed to have a reaction and sneezed twice.
0:46:51|0:46:55|He muttered [Aying]'s name and looked towards home.
0:47:0|0:47:9|Upon hearing Qin Gui calling out to herself, Zuo Zuomu snapped back to reality. On the other side, Uncle Shunzi finished packing up, walked out the door, locked it, wiped away the tears on his face, and set off.
0:47:9|0:47:21|The fugitive trio arrived at a trench made entirely of soil. [Qin Gui] picked up a stone from the ground and followed behind the storyteller. He raised the stone in his hand, about to throw it, but was spotted by [Uncle Shunzi].
0:47:23|0:47:27|Qin Gui, with a gun pointed at his back, immediately dropped the stone in his hand.
0:47:57|0:48:4|A group of villagers holding shovels appeared on the hilltop. The three looked up and heard someone in the crowd shout.
0:49:1|0:49:8|Uncle Shunzi walked towards the three with his back turned, and said.
0:50:0|0:50:6|Zuo Zuomu held the young master of Sandalwood Cotton in his arms, bowing his head in contemplation.
0:50:21|0:50:26|Speaking of this, [Zuo Zuomu] Ichiro looked at the sandalwood prince in his hand and said to the person beside him.
0:50:38|0:50:47|Zuo Zuomu's eyes became more determined as he spoke, but suddenly, a harsh sound interrupted him. Looking up, he saw that the record in the phonograph had broken.
0:50:47|0:50:50|The other three looked at the messy scene in front of them.
0:52:24|0:52:32|Watching the Storyteller walk away, Qin Gui knelt down with a thud and said to the Storyteller.
0:53:25|0:53:30|[Qin Gui] sobbed uncontrollably, pleading with [Storyteller], tears rolling down his face in big drops.
0:53:30|0:53:34|The Storyteller helps Qin Gui, who is kneeling on the ground.
0:54:16|0:54:17|After listening, [Storyteller] felt his pocket and realized that the attack map was not on him. He became flustered and hesitated before speaking.
0:54:41|0:54:59|Listen, several people took a deep breath together, in the village, the Japanese soldiers were still patrolling in an orderly manner. They stuck their heads out and looked at the dark crowd of Japanese soldiers, exclaiming in shock.
0:55:41|0:55:51|The three agreed [Qin Gui] once again disguised as Japanese soldiers, swaggering into the enemy camp with the bound [Uncle Shunzi].
0:55:51|0:55:54|The group of people who successfully infiltrated are searching for the cellar in the crowd.
0:56:12|0:56:33|Suddenly, a Japanese soldier stopped them, walked up to [Uncle Shunzi], and said.
0:56:33|0:56:37|Uncle Shunzi breathed a sigh of relief as he watched the Japanese soldiers leave, then turned his head to look at [Ah Ying].
0:56:49|0:56:55|[Qin Gui] finished speaking, his eyes filled with determination, carrying a fearless courage, he strode forward confidently.
0:56:55|0:57:0|At this moment, [Zuo Zuomu] Ichiro was still cleaning his wounds.
0:57:0|0:57:7|[Qin Gui], [Uncle Shunzi], and the others were still standing in the corner, watching [Zuo Zuomu] Ichiro writhing in pain ahead. Finally, they gathered their courage and took a few steps forward.
0:57:10|0:57:16|[Uncle Shunzi] had only taken a few steps when he was suddenly startled by a loud shout from [Zuo Zuomu] Ichiro.
0:57:40|0:57:47|Zuo Zuomu listened, picked up the wooden stick beside him, and struggled to stand up. He then hobbled out the door, leaning on the stick with each step.
0:57:47|0:57:54|Standing at the door, Qin Gui looked at the Japanese soldiers outside the fire and waved his hand.
0:58:32|0:58:35|The named [Uncle Shunzi] was so scared that he was trembling.
0:59:2|0:59:6|The slip of the tongue by [Qin Gui] caused [Uncle Shunzi] to gasp in shock, sweating profusely.
0:59:6|0:59:11|At this moment, the clueless Uncle Shunzi crawled out of the cellar.
0:59:11|0:59:18|The Storyteller took out his props and immediately imitated the roaring sound of an airplane when he saw Qin Gui.
0:59:22|0:59:25|The Japanese soldiers heard it and quickly lay down on the ground, while Uncle Shunzi pulled up Qin Gui from the ground.
0:59:28|0:59:31|On the other side, [Uncle Shunzi] also successfully climbed over the wall and jumped onto a car to escape.
0:59:44|0:59:46|Uncle Shunzi swiftly knocked him out with a punch.
0:59:47|0:59:50|The driverless car also crashed into the haystack on the other side.
0:59:50|0:59:57|After a loud noise, [Uncle Shunzi], covered in straw, crawled out from the haystack, looked around, and immediately ran off.
0:59:57|1:0:12|Unexpectedly, the next moment, a car appeared in front of him, scaring him so much that he turned and ran.
1:0:12|1:0:15|The person in the car grabbed Uncle Shunzi by the collar and pulled him into the car.
1:0:22|1:0:26|Upon hearing these words, [Uncle Shunzi] finally calmed down and turned around to see that it was actually [Qin Gui].
1:1:17|1:1:25|After the sound of gunfire, the car drove into a ditch, and the group of people inadvertently missed a military vehicle full of ghosts and bandits due to this mishap.
1:1:25|1:1:29|The military vehicle drove along a small road to the mountain pass, where the bandits lying in ambush here were ordered by Qin Gui.
1:2:38|1:3:2|Having successfully escaped danger, the group arrived in front of a temple. Suddenly, [Qin Gui] raised his gun and spoke to the other three.
1:3:2|1:3:5|[Qin Gui] looked at [Uncle Shunzi], who only raised one hand, and asked.
1:3:9|1:3:17|Wearing a Japanese military uniform, [Qin Gui] raised his gun towards the three people with their hands up, looked around and saw no one nearby, then searched [Uncle Shunzi]'s body.
1:3:17|1:3:24|With a few quick moves, they found the attack plan hidden on [Uncle Shunzi], and the three of them looked at [Qin Gui] with a face full of resentment.
1:3:35|1:3:41|Uncle Shunzi looked at Qin Gui with a face full of disbelief as he raised his hand.
1:3:41|1:3:52|Qin Gui slowly raised his hand and walked towards Uncle Shunzi, who quickly covered his face with both hands.
1:3:52|1:3:55|Qin Gui slapped the Storyteller across the face.
1:4:2|1:4:6|Uncle Shunzi pushed Qin Gui aside and ran out when he saw the Japanese soldiers coming out.
1:4:6|1:4:12|The three of them watched as [Uncle Shunzi] ran away, speechless, and the next second they were taken to the temple.
1:4:12|1:4:16|In the temple, [Qin Gui] is bowing his head, reporting to the Japanese leader.
1:4:46|1:4:52|[Uncle Shunzi] snorted coldly, rolled his eyes, and suddenly saw something next to him, walking over in a daze.
1:4:53|1:5:4|[Uncle Shunzi] pushed aside the curtain, and his beloved son Qin Gui appeared before him, as if meeting a long-lost friend. He tenderly touched her face, and Zuo Zuomu stood up at the sight.
1:5:32|1:5:35|Zuo Zuomu admires Uncle Shunzi.
1:6:51|1:7:2|[Uncle Shunzi] thought for a moment and watched as [Zuo Zuomu] Ichiro plucked the bowstring.
1:7:2|1:7:8|Zuo Zuomu gave the order, and the invaders picked up the cushions at hand and knelt down in rows.
1:7:8|1:7:13|Qin Gui, sitting cross-legged, quickly changed his sitting posture upon noticing the difference between himself and the Japanese soldiers.
1:7:13|1:7:16|Zuo Zuomu, who had just sat down, turned his head and said to Qin Gui.
1:7:38|1:7:42|[Qin Gui] cleared his throat and picked up the Cotton Gentleman seriously.
1:7:54|1:7:59|She stood on the high mountain, calling out to her beloved.
1:8:21|1:8:31|Qin Gui, who was about to transform, looked at Uncle Shunzi with a worried expression on his face.
1:8:31|1:8:37|[Qin Gui] breathed a sigh of relief, but the next second, [Zuo Zuomu] Ichiro pointed to the wooden board and asked, "What is the name of that instrument?"
1:8:52|1:8:56|Qin Gui asked incredulously.
1:8:56|1:9:7|Outside the temple, [Uncle Shunzi] hides behind a pillar, looking towards the temple and listening to the voices inside, then starts cursing.
1:9:7|1:9:17|In the temple, [Qin Gui] kept the rhythm while exchanging glances with [Uncle Shunzi] who was playing the cotton bow. Then [Zuo Zuomu] Ichiro spoke up.
1:11:4|1:11:11|Zuo Zuomu bows to Qin Gui and hands the wooden board in his hand to the storyteller, walking over with a flattering expression.
1:11:14|1:11:16|[Qin Gui] widened his eyes, swallowed hard, and said.
1:11:30|1:11:34|Zuo Zuomu nodded and turned to the Japanese soldiers behind him, saying.
1:11:37|1:11:42|With an incredulous look on his face, Qin Gui raised his head outside the temple, Uncle Shunzi said to the person beside him.
1:11:42|1:11:44|In the temple, Zuo Zuomu conducts the choir.
1:12:16|1:12:22|Outside the temple, [Aying] with a bundle on her back, heard the distant singing and walked towards the temple.
1:12:22|1:12:25|In the temple, Zuo Zuomu looks at Qin Gui blankly and says.
1:12:32|1:12:36|[Qin Gui] stood up trembling, eyes wide with fear, looking around nervously before singing in a quivering voice.
1:13:40|1:13:43|Unexpectedly, [Qin Gui] actually appeared at the entrance of the temple.
1:13:44|1:13:44|Zuo Zuomu sighed at the sight.
1:14:59|1:15:8|Qin Gui looked at Zuo Zuomu's departing figure with lingering fear. But the next moment, when he lowered his head and checked, he found that the attack map he had stuffed into Zuo Zuomu's package had actually fallen on the ground.
1:15:8|1:15:18|Qin Gui squatted down carefully, picked up the map, and was about to tuck it into his arms when Zuo Zuomu shouted from behind.
1:15:41|1:15:45|The Japanese soldiers singing in the temple widened their eyes when they heard footsteps outside.
1:15:58|1:16:6|Zuo Zuomu listens to the commotion outside the temple and exclaims in disbelief.
1:16:6|1:16:15|Outside the temple, the villagers on the hill waved their hoes and marched towards the temple in a grand manner.
1:16:15|1:16:19|Qin Gui, who was about to flee, was stopped by Zuo Zuomu's order.
1:16:21|1:16:27|In the next moment, Zuo Zuomu was riding on the shoulders of [Qin Gui].
1:16:27|1:16:33|Zuo Zuomu, riding on Qin Gui's shoulders, was carried by the reckless Qin Gui and crashed into the ceiling beam, falling straight backwards.
1:16:33|1:16:38|Qin Gui continued to run unknowingly, but as he ran, only two boots were left on Qin Gui's body.
1:16:46|1:16:57|In the temple, [Uncle Shunzi] spoke to the Buddha statue,
1:16:57|1:17:2|Uncle Shunzi hurriedly informed the villagers as he watched the Japanese soldiers fleeing from the back door.
1:17:2|1:17:8|The villagers who had just arrived at the temple gate happened to encounter two people running out of the temple, one of whom spoke, [Uncle Shunzi].
1:17:53|1:18:1|On the other side, the fleeing Japanese soldiers had already arrived in the city by car, and Zuo Zuomu shouted at the people in the car to speak up.
1:18:12|1:18:17|Approaching the door, Qin Gui, who was about to slip away, was spotted by the sharp-eyed Zuo Zuomu beside him.
1:18:17|1:18:23|Watching the Japanese soldiers following behind him, [Qin Gui] could only reluctantly shuffle his feet and slowly walk inside.
1:18:23|1:18:35|At this moment, the Japanese soldiers are conducting a thorough search of the people entering the city at the city gate.
1:18:35|1:18:38|[Uncle Shunzi] and the other two arrived at the city gate, watched by [Storyteller].
1:18:45|1:18:53|[Aying] had just walked into her own front gate when she brushed past the three people entering the city.
1:18:53|1:19:0|Three people aimlessly arrived at the entrance of a courtyard, and the Storyteller spoke first.
1:19:0|1:19:3|As soon as they entered the courtyard, they were chased out by the dogs in the courtyard.
1:19:7|1:19:12|[Uncle Shunzi] is at the door, the lecherous shopkeeper is knocking again, [Uncle Shunzi] opens the door.
1:19:12|1:19:13|[Aying] raised his fist.
1:19:26|1:19:34|The shouting shopkeeper was suddenly pointed at by a sharp knife. The shopkeeper quickly raised his hands and slowly turned around, while [Qin Gui] heard the sound and looked outside.
1:19:34|1:19:39|The next moment, the shopkeeper appeared at the door, causing [Qin Gui] to gasp in shock.
1:19:48|1:19:52|The shopkeeper nodded, [Qin Gui] was about to slip out the door.
1:19:55|1:20:2|Qin Gui stood sideways with his back to the shopkeeper, slowly walking while taking off his hat to cover his face.
1:20:2|1:20:3|The shopkeeper looked at him in confusion from behind.
1:20:10|1:20:15|Qin Gui took the photo, exclaimed in shock, and used it to cover his face.
1:20:15|1:20:20|Ichiro Zuo stood up in confusion, using his hand to move the photo blocking Qin Gui's face.
1:20:20|1:20:22|Qin Gui, feeling guilty, smiled nervously at the sight.
1:20:22|1:20:28|Zuo Zuomu compared Qin Gui with the photo on his left and right, and Qin Gui was so scared that he held the photo in front of his face again.
1:20:33|1:20:40|Qin Gui patted Qin Gui and took out a package.
1:21:7|1:21:21|Qin Gui, reciting a mantra silently, knocked down Zuo Zuomu with a punch, sending him flying and hanging upside down on a cabinet. Meanwhile, the escaped Qin Gui passed by Uncle Shunzi and the other two brothers. Suddenly, Uncle Shunzi noticed Qin Gui.
1:21:31|1:21:45|Suddenly, the youngest three covered [Qin Gui]'s mouth and dragged him away.
1:21:45|1:21:50|The youngest brother who walked to the door was hugged by [Zuo Zuomu], while [Qin Gui] who had his mouth covered anxiously looked at the mistaken [Zuo Zuomu].
1:22:18|1:22:41|Three people followed [Qin Gui] into the courtyard. The ugly man, [Ah Ying] and [Qin Gui] with the package, were blocked by [Uncle Shunzi] and two others.
1:22:54|1:23:1|Qin Gui looked at Zuo Zuomu as he took out an identical small package, his eyes widening.
1:23:1|1:23:7|[Qin Gui] walked towards the three of them step by step with a package in his hands. He solemnly handed the package to [Uncle Shunzi] and began to speak.
1:23:11|1:23:17|Suddenly, a member of the Eighth Route Army walked over, pointing a gun at them.
1:23:17|1:23:21|Erzhu walked towards Uncle Shunzi excitedly, looking at the package in his hands.
1:23:43|1:23:50|On the other side, the Eighth Route Army opened the package, and [Qin Gui] looked at the attack map, speaking with a puzzled expression.
1:24:11|1:24:14|[Zuo Zuomu] stopped and lowered his head nervously.
1:24:14|1:24:20|[Zuo Zuomu] lowered his eyes and, before leaving, did not forget the songbook on the table that he cherished.
1:24:20|1:24:29|Turning around for a moment, Qin Gui quietly picked up the songbook behind him, tucked it into his arms, and walked towards the door with a cane, taking one step at a time.
1:24:29|1:24:35|Thus, the battle between the common people and the Japanese army ended with the victory of the common people.
