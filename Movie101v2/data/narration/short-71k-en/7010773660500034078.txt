0:2:32|0:2:43|[Ye Wen] lives with his wife and younger son in the United States after sending his eldest son there. At this moment, a man appears at the half-open door on the fifth floor.
0:2:47|0:2:52|[Ye Wen] was trimming flowers when he heard a man approaching. He turned around to look.
0:3:8|0:3:38|Li Xiaolong patted his muscular chest and answered confidently. Ye Wen put down the scissors and turned to Li Xiaolong, saying, "Just as he finished speaking, Li Xiaolong clenched his right fist to his chest, left hand at his side in a stance. Seeing this, Ye Wen sat on a stool, took out a cigarette from the pack, put it in his mouth, and lit a match with force."
0:3:38|0:3:47|Standing to the left of [Ye Wen], [Li Xiaolong] lifted his leg and kicked the matchstick near his mouth. [Ye Wen] skillfully dodged it and successfully lit the cigarette.
0:3:47|0:4:3|So [Li Xiaolong] came to his front, lifted his leg again to sweep towards his face, but [Ye Wen] stood still like a mountain, then flicked the cigarette in his hand out forcefully. [Ye Wen] picked up the cigarette box, took out one by one, and flicked them in different directions.
0:4:5|0:4:13|[Journalist Li] saw the sudden challenge and didn't panic. He immediately kicked away all the bullets with his legs.
0:4:13|0:4:28|Following that, [Ye Wen] flicked out three cigarettes at once. With the difficulty greatly increased, [Li Xiaolong] accurately jumped in place and kicked them away with the sole of his right foot. The force was so strong that upon hitting the wall and floor, each cigarette broke in half from the middle.
0:4:28|0:4:38|At this moment, [Ye Wen] picked up the teacup and splashed water towards [Li Xiaolong]. Without hesitation, [Li Xiaolong] raised his right leg again and chopped towards the tea water coming from directly in front.
0:4:47|0:5:3|Li Xiaolong touched his face after listening, wiped off the water stains, gritted his teeth and lowered his head unwillingly. Suddenly, Ye Wen's figure disappeared from the seat. The scene shifted, and he had already walked to the side of the door. He opened the door, stood aside, and glanced in Li Xiaolong's direction.
0:5:3|0:5:16|Bruce Lee pursed his lips, then vigorously rubbed the tip of his nose with his thumb, walked angrily towards Ye Wen, intentionally stopped in front of Ye Wen, smiled, and quickly passed through the door and left the room.
0:5:16|0:5:24|[Ye Wen] smiled and slowly closed the door. The scene then shifted to a bustling street.
0:5:24|0:5:54|At the end of the street is [Zhang Tianzhi] Elementary School. The school bell for the end of class rang, and children in neat school uniforms happily ran out from different teaching buildings. They then gathered by the outdoor stairs, where two boys stood facing each other in a small path next to the stairs. After speaking, these two boys in martial arts poses fiercely attacked each other.
0:5:54|0:6:0|The shorter [Ye Wen] is getting a bruised right eye, then he strikes back hard and bruises the left eye of [Zhang Yongcheng].
0:6:1|0:6:6|Just as the two were grappling, a woman with long hair ran over.
0:8:20|0:8:40|[Ye Wen] finished speaking, picked up a piece of fish and put it in [Mrs. Ye]'s bowl. After a hearty dinner, [Mrs. Ye] was washing dishes in the kitchen with an apron on, while [Ye Wen] walked towards the wooden dummy indoors. [Zhang Yongcheng] was practicing in front of the dummy, and [Ye Wen] sat obediently on the side watching [Zhang Yongcheng].
0:8:48|0:9:14|Smiling [Ye Wen] heard the knock on the door. The door opened, and a bearded man stood at the doorway. [Zhang Yongcheng]'s father walked in with a serious expression, glancing around [Ye Wen]'s luxuriously decorated home as he walked. [Zhang Yongcheng] ran over after listening.
0:10:5|0:10:11|Shortly after, [Zhang Yongcheng] and his son walked out of [Ye Wen]'s house.
0:10:33|0:10:45|[Zhang Yongcheng]'s father pulled up the yellow taxi outside the building.
0:10:58|0:11:34|At this moment in the black market, a slick-haired man is dancing on the gambling table. Amidst the crowd's cheers, [Zhang Yongcheng]'s father, also known as [Zhang Tianzhi], ties a cloth strip on his forehead. Then a muscular man clenches his fist and charges towards him. [Zhang Tianzhi] responds with straight punches and a series of palm strikes, followed by a kick that sends the man flying out. Just then, the door of the black market opens, and a woman in a cheongsam and a bald foreigner holding a little girl walk in.
0:11:47|0:12:15|After Jingsheng called out to [Zhang Tianzhi], he jumped off the gambling table and walked towards the direction of the boss. It turned out that the bald foreigner was the boss of the Black Fist Market. The boss sent the little girl to the side of the cheongsam woman, instructed her to wait there for a while, and then took Jingsheng up the stairs behind the cheongsam woman to the office.
0:12:24|0:12:31|Jingsheng took out a thick bag of money from the safe, and after the boss flipped through it, he praised Jingsheng for doing a good job.
0:12:47|0:13:0|Jingsheng gritted his teeth and agreed to the boss's request. The boss emphasized once again the importance of the school. At this moment, the boss saw Zhang Tianzhi through the window, using his martial arts skills to knock down the muscular man on the boxing ring.
0:13:5|0:13:17|The muscular man on the boxing ring has collapsed against the edge of the platform. [Zhang Tianzhi] did not choose mercy, but instead kicked him in the head. Seeing the opponent completely fall down, the boss nodded at [Zhang Tianzhi].
0:14:56|0:15:2|In the dance hall, [Mrs. Ye] angrily hung up the phone on the table and then danced with her male partner.
0:15:19|0:15:24|In this way, [Ye Wen] and many martial artists took a group photo.
0:16:55|0:17:3|Between the two of them talking, the school bell for the end of class rang, and the children ran out of the teaching building one after another.
0:17:17|0:17:24|At this moment, Brother Sheng, accompanied by two henchmen, walked past [Ye Wen] and his son, heading towards the school.
0:18:11|0:18:20|Ma Jingsheng dragged the principal's head and knocked it on the table, then pressed his hand on the deed, followed by punching the principal's hand.
0:18:23|0:18:31|At this moment, [Ye Wen] arrived and pushed Brother Sheng out two meters, then overturned those two henchmen.
0:18:36|0:18:51|After speaking, Brother Sheng swung his arms towards [Ye Wen]. Before he could get close, he was pressed against the edge of the bed by him. [Ye Wen] pressed Brother Sheng with his left arm, picked up the phone next to him with his right hand, and dialed out.
0:20:9|0:20:18|Later, [Sir Bo] left the school with his colleagues. Watching their departing figures, [Ye Wen] let out a deep sigh.
0:20:40|0:20:53|Early the next morning, the neighbors found that the school gate was unexpectedly sealed off. [Teacher Huang] stood in front of the gate, shouting.
0:21:0|0:21:15|[Ye Wen] looked at the sealed gate and came up with a solution. The disciples of the martial arts school took axes to cut the chains on the gate and together moved the wooden boards aside.
0:21:17|0:21:23|[Ye] is holding [Ye Wen]'s hand and saying, "Teacher Huang is thanking Ah Li."
0:21:46|0:21:53|Teacher Huang and Xu Li smiled as they watched the children, while not far away, Brother Sheng's men were keeping an eye on the school.
0:22:3|0:22:31|[Xu Li] smiled and turned to walk towards his brothers. Unlike [Xu Li]'s optimism, [Ye Wen] frowned as he watched the direction Ma Jingsheng's men were leaving. On the lively street outside the school at night, with the shops all closed, [Ye Wen] and [Xu Li] were still inside the school, sitting on the railing. [Ye Wen] took out a cigarette box from his pocket but then put it back, seeming to think that smoking in school was not appropriate.
0:22:31|0:22:37|[Xu Li] is guarding outside the teaching building on the steps.
0:23:36|0:23:46|As soon as the principal finished speaking, someone cut off the lock on the back door of the school, and then a group of people rushed in carrying iron buckets.
0:23:49|0:24:2|At this moment, a crowd of people with sticks rushed in from outside the school. Soon, [Xu Li] and his brothers started fighting with them. When they saw the thugs running towards [Teacher Huang], [Ye Wen] quickly dealt with them with three punches and two kicks.
0:24:4|0:24:23|On the other side, the person carrying the iron bucket rushed into the teaching building, then spread the contents of the bucket on the desks and chairs. Outside the door, [Xu Li] and others were held back by a large group of thugs, so the people inside the teaching building lit torches and threw them at the desks and chairs. It turned out that the iron bucket contained gasoline. At this moment, the unprotected principal was covered, protected by [Teacher Huang].
0:24:25|0:24:33|After speaking, [Ye Wen] rushed towards the direction where the principal was taken away, effortlessly dealing with the hooligans by the railing.
0:24:33|0:25:4|Then, as he reached the stairs, facing the opponents coming at him with sticks, [Ye Wen] delivered a series of rapid punches smashing straight into their chests, or viciously kicked towards their knees. When [Xu Li] reached the top of the stairs, [Ye Wen] saw over a dozen more people rushing up from the bottom of the stairs. Eager to save the principal, [Ye Wen] didn't linger on the steps, leaping onto the handrail and landing at the bottom of the stairs, once again delivering a flurry of punches to the thugs' chests.
0:25:8|0:25:16|[Zhang Tianzhi] happened to be passing by in a yellow taxi when he saw the injustice. He rushed towards the principal and kicked down three people with a flying kick.
0:25:16|0:25:25|A heavy punch landed on the temple of a thug, causing him to immediately pass out. The principal took advantage of the chaos and slipped back with the sack.
0:25:25|0:25:35|The gang leader picked up a wooden stick and smashed it towards [Zhang Tianzhi], but he dodged it and then kicked the gang leader hard in the chest, causing him to fall backwards.
0:25:35|0:25:43|Shortly after, [Zhang Tianzhi] used his elbow to smash the ribs and chests of the thugs, instantly adding two more painful opponents on the ground.
0:25:43|0:26:1|At this moment, [Ye Wen] finished dealing with some people and saw [Zhang Tianzhi] on the steps. [Zhang Tianzhi] was holding a thug's wrist with his left hand and delivering a powerful blow to his armpit with his right hand, sending him flying off the ground. Meanwhile, [Ye Wen] was punching the thugs' throats, finally arriving at the school gate.
0:26:1|0:26:25|Suddenly, a thug wielding an axe swung towards [Zhang Tianzhi]. He bent down to the left to dodge and then struck the thug's chest fiercely. He then lifted his foot and kicked another thug towards a nearby shop. Nearly a hundred people clutched their chests and fell to the ground. The thug leader, in fear, shouted to retreat. On the school stairs, as well as on the street outside, the thugs quickly got up.
0:26:25|0:26:32|Supported by [Ye Wen] and [Zhang Tianzhi], they left with assistance, and automatically kept their distance out of fear as they passed by.
0:27:3|0:27:7|[Zhang Tianzhi] returned to the side of the yellow taxi in despair, picked up the money on the ground,
0:27:26|0:27:32|Then [Zhang Tianzhi] pulled Teacher Huang into a taxi and ran out of the bustling street.
0:28:12|0:28:29|Ye Wen, who had just changed the light bulb, awkwardly turned off the light after hearing the embarrassing news. Oops, sorry, sorry.
0:28:32|0:28:39|The scene shifts, and outside a small house, [Zhang Tianzhi] and his son are greeted by a chubby woman.
0:29:31|0:29:38|[Zhang Tianzhi] ignored the fat landlord's sarcasm and instead smiled as he led [Zhang Yongcheng] away.
0:30:14|0:30:22|Sir Bo was then asked to roll out of his office, and he had no choice but to come out. The scene shifted to the street outside the school.
0:30:26|0:30:33|[Xu Li] is playing games with children in the school at this time, while [Ye Wen] is sitting in the breakfast shop outside the main gate.
0:30:57|0:31:15|On the other side, [Mrs. Ye] walked out of the bathroom holding a basin. As she reached the living room, she suddenly clutched her abdomen, sat down on a nearby chair, unable to bear the pain. Gasping for breath, she rested her hands on her thighs for a while, then bent down to support her forehead.
0:31:30|0:31:39|[Ye Wen] sat in the breakfast shop holding an empty cup, staring blankly ahead. At this moment, [Tian Aoshan] ran over with an umbrella.
0:32:46|0:32:54|On the other side, [Sir Bo] arrived at the entrance of the primary school, watching the playing children with a pensive expression.
0:34:34|0:34:41|Suddenly, [Ma Jingsheng] pulled out a small knife and stabbed towards [Tian Aoshan], but was promptly stopped by [Ye Wen].
0:34:58|0:35:5|At the command, everyone in the shipyard picked up knives and charged forward.
0:35:26|0:35:42|[Sir Bo] pulled out a gun and roared: then he dragged Brother Sheng from under [Ye Wen]'s hands, pushing him directly in front of himself.
0:36:6|0:36:18|Sir Bo took a step back, raised his pistol, and pointed it forcefully at Brother Sheng's forehead. Brother Sheng could only keep retreating, shaking his head fiercely while glaring at Sir Bo, Ye Wen, and Master Tian.
0:37:43|0:37:48|[Ye Wen]'s profound words left [Sir Bo] speechless.
0:37:48|0:37:58|In a moment of panic, [Sir Bo] accidentally knocked over the water glass while trying to take a sip. Feeling the pressure from the two masters' gaze, he eventually took out a cigarette and started smoking slowly.
0:37:58|0:38:22|At night, [Ye Wen] quietly opened the door of the house with a key, gently closed it, and walked to the outside of the bedroom door. After opening a crack, he found Mrs. Ye and Ye Zheng sleeping soundly in each other's arms. Looking at the mother and son, [Ye Wen] stood outside the bedroom and smiled happily. Then [Ye Wen] went to the dining room and found a torn calendar paper under a bowl pressed by Mrs. Ye.
0:38:22|0:38:31|On top it says: Pour it out if you don't drink it. After taking a sip, [Ye Wen] picked up the paper and carefully examined it, then smiled gently.
0:38:31|0:38:42|He then draped the gown over the chair next to the table, placed a torn calendar paper underneath the bowl, put a button on top of the paper, and turned off the room's light.
0:38:42|0:38:57|The next morning, Mrs. Ye opened the bedroom door and saw [Ye Wen] sleeping on the rocking chair in the living room. As she approached, she noticed the note under the bowl on the table, which read "Please nail up the twist pins," and then
0:39:29|0:39:40|Taking the piece of paper in his hand, he sat back down. The paper was the one he tore off casually last night, with a button sewn tightly onto it. The scene then shifted to the gynecological examination room.
0:39:57|0:40:18|Upon hearing this, [Ye Wen]'s wife sat in her seat in a daze, then drooped her arms and walked out of the clinic. After leaving the hospital, although burdened with heavy thoughts, [Ye Wen]'s wife still carried on as usual, walking through the bustling streets to pick up Ye from school. Suddenly, she stopped in her tracks.
0:40:36|0:40:50|In the dark underground fight club at night, [Zhang Tianzhi] landed a direct punch to his opponent's face, followed by an upward flying kick that sent the opponent flying in the air and crashing hard onto the ground. [Ma Jingsheng] nodded in approval as he watched from the side.
0:41:42|0:41:54|[Zhang Tianzhi] lowered his head for a moment, then looked up and said, [Ma Jingsheng] sneered, then walked past him towards the gambling table behind.
0:42:5|0:42:22|[Ma Jingsheng] smiled satisfactorily upon hearing this, then took out a thick stack of money and waved it at [Zhang Tianzhi]. The scene shifted, showing [Tian Aoshan] wearing glasses and fixing umbrellas in his own shop with the lights on, outside the house.
0:42:32|0:42:47|Upon hearing the noise, [Tian Aoshan] closed the umbrella in his hand and looked towards the entrance of the shop. [Zhang Tianzhi] slowly turned around, glaring fiercely at [Tian Aoshan]. They then started fighting in the narrow aisle that could only accommodate two people.
0:42:47|0:43:10|[Zhang Tianzhi] jumped onto the table in the shop, kicked towards the chest of [Tian Aoshan], then without waiting for him to stabilize, he got up again and kicked the other side of the table, scattering it. At this moment, [Tian Aoshan] also stepped on the table and jumped with force, grabbing the bamboo pole on the ceiling and kicking towards [Zhang Tianzhi]'s chest. Unexpectedly, [Zhang Tianzhi] grabbed his ankle and pulled hard, causing both of them, along with the ceiling, to crash to the ground.
0:43:10|0:43:24|Tian Aoshan then pushed aside the bamboo pole, picked up an umbrella and stabbed towards Zhang Tianzhi, but he used the umbrella to hook around his neck and smashed it towards his chest, causing his head to hit the cupboard, and his right arm was also severely smashed and broken by Zhang Tianzhi.
0:43:24|0:43:34|Arriving at [Ye Wen]'s home, just as he picked up the keys from the shoe cabinet to open the door and go out, the bedroom door in the room opened.
0:43:37|0:43:43|After listening, [Ye Wen] closed the door and walked back into the room with a smile, feeling awakened.
0:43:57|0:44:4|Just as [Ye Wen]'s wife hesitated whether to speak out, the phone in the room suddenly rang.
0:44:21|0:44:34|Jingsheng leaned on the nurse station with one hand, smiling at the nurse and then gesturing to his men. Meanwhile, Xu Li was teaching children boxing in the flower bed of the primary school.
0:44:38|0:44:50|On the other side, Ye Wen, who received a phone call, hurried to the hospital. After finding the ward, he discovered Tian Aoshan with his entire right arm in a cast. Ye Wen then poured him a glass of water.
0:45:27|0:45:40|Seeing Jingsheng locking Ye Wen [Zhang Tianzhi] in the car, Xu Li stepped forward and smashed the chests of Jingsheng's men, but outnumbered, Xu Li was hit on the back of the head by an opponent wielding a stick and fell to the ground.
0:45:49|0:46:4|Tian Aoshan shook his head earnestly while lying on the hospital bed. At that moment, Mrs. Ye, who was resting on a bamboo chair in the living room, heard a knock on the door. Xu Li, with a bruised face, asked.
0:46:24|0:46:52|Outside the school on the street, [Teacher Huang] anxiously said to [Ye Wen]: [Teacher Huang] listened and hurriedly ran towards the street. Now at the shipyard, the fifteen workers holding sticks stepped back step by step. It turned out that [Ye Wen] was walking in with a ten-meter long bamboo pole from outside the gate with great momentum. Then [Ye Wen] passed these fifteen people and turned towards the depths of the shipyard. The workers here were different from those at the gate.
0:46:52|0:47:4|They held wrenches and axes in their hands, staring fiercely at the figure of [Ye Wen]. Ignoring these intense gazes, [Ye Wen] crossed over nearly thirty people and arrived at an open space.
0:47:22|0:47:28|His henchmen knocked on the cage behind him,
0:47:36|0:47:44|Upon hearing the order, the henchmen dragged [Ye Wen] out of the cage.
0:48:10|0:48:38|[Ye Wen] looked at [Ye Zheng], who was being threatened with a fruit knife, and forcefully slammed the bamboo pole to the ground. Hearing [Ye Zheng]'s cries, [Ye Wen] knelt down with a sigh, closed his eyes slowly, then propped himself up with his hands on the ground, bent down, and knocked his head. The workers around laughed. At this moment, [Zhang Tianzhi] pushed through the crowd and stepped forward.
0:49:0|0:49:18|[Zhang Tianzhi] was released and quickly walked down the stairs from the shelf. Upon seeing this, [Zhang Tianzhi] hurriedly stepped onto the steps, touched [Zhang Tianzhi]'s head, and helped him down the stairs. He paused as he passed by [Ye Wen], then left with [Zhang Tianzhi].
0:49:34|0:49:40|After finishing speaking, Brother Sheng put the apple pierced by the blade into his mouth, then looked at [Ye Wen] he was holding.
0:49:40|0:49:51|At this time, under Brother Sheng's signal, eleven fighters with cloth strips on their heads and bandages on their hands ran from all directions of the shipyard, waving their fists as they ran to warm up.
0:49:51|0:50:22|Ye Wen slowly stood up. At this point, 11 people gathered and formed a circle, surrounding Ye Wen in the middle. Ye Wen then assumed a horse stance, with his left fist placed at his ribs and his right hand in front of his chest. As a punch came from the side, Ye Wen stayed in place and swung his elbow back. Unexpectedly, three people pushed Ye Wen towards a wooden post on the side, while another person kicked towards Ye Wen's waist in the chaos, causing him to fall onto the wooden frame. As he looked up and saw Ye Zheng crying, Ye Wen propped up his upper body.
0:50:22|0:50:31|He then turned around and ran up the wooden structure. Zhang Feng, who had just walked out of the shipyard, stopped in his tracks.
0:50:31|0:50:40|Ye Wen tugged at Zhang Tianzhi's vest, looked up at him, Zhang Tianzhi frowned and thought for a moment, then hugged Zhang Feng's shoulder and walked forward again.
0:50:40|0:50:53|At this moment, a group of thugs chased after [Ye Wen] onto the wooden boat suspended in the air. [Ye Wen], who was entangled by four people at the bow of the boat, hurriedly ran to the center of the boat on a wooden plank, only to be successfully ambushed by someone climbing up from the side of the boat.
0:50:53|0:51:13|[Ye Wen] was thrown hard onto the boat's frame, but he quickly propped himself up on it. With a swift move, he firmly stood in the middle of the boat again, facing the eleven attackers. [Ye Wen] used his fists and knees calmly to push them back. Suddenly, [Zhang Tianzhi] made his way through the crowd and stepped onto the platform, approaching Brother Sheng.
0:51:16|0:51:26|As soon as the words fell, [Zhang Tianzhi] threw a punch directly at Brother Sang's face, causing him to fall back and hit the armrest, leaving a nosebleed. He then grabbed the hand of the henchman holding Ye Zheng's right hand and broke his thumb.
0:51:45|0:52:9|Causing his arm to break on the spot, at this moment, Brother Sheng regained consciousness and picked up a fruit knife to stab [Zhang Tianzhi]. [Zhang Tianzhi] first dodged, then fiercely smashed Brother Sheng's collarbone with his elbow, and finally pounded his chest with both fists in succession. Meanwhile, [Ye Wen], after using a shoulder throw to flip a thug to the ground, turned around to see [Zhang Tianzhi] coming to help on the shelf.
0:52:9|0:52:36|He ran out of the ship, jumped onto the ground on the scaffolding, and workers then wielded wrenches and wooden sticks towards [Ye Wen]. He dodged them and took away two wooden sticks. Seeing this, Brother Sheng quickly picked up Ye who was standing by the cage and twisted his body to walk down the stairs. On the ground, as many as fifty people held sticks, trembling and pointing them at [Ye Wen]. Seeing Ye being dragged into the factory, [Ye Wen] swung the wooden sticks twice and quickly chased after.
0:52:36|0:52:57|At this moment, [Ma Jingsheng] carried [Ye Zheng] and a group of henchmen into the factory, climbed onto the knee-high wooden frame. Seeing [Ye Wen] chasing in, the henchmen on both sides attacked, more and more henchmen on the ground. [Ye Wen] hurriedly ran to the frame, waving the twin sticks to strike the heads, waists, and chests of the incoming attackers.
0:53:0|0:53:14|At this moment, [Ma Jingsheng] had [Ye Zheng]'s neck sandwiched in front of him, raising his right hand in threat. With a command, [Ye Zheng] fiercely bit down, then took the opportunity to slip away from him and jumped to the ground.
0:53:15|0:53:47|[Ye Wen] hurriedly said: [Ye Zheng] listened and ran outside the factory, while [Ye Wen] was entangled and unable to help. [Ye Zheng] quickly climbed into the wooden ladder, [Ye Wen] rushed to stand by, and saw someone sticking their head into the wooden ladder. [Ye Wen] struck the person on the head with a stick, then stood by the ladder and fought one against one, and two against one. At this moment, a person suddenly drilled in from the bottom of the wooden ladder, [Ye Zheng] hurriedly ran out.
0:53:55|0:54:9|At this moment, [Ma Jingsheng] saw [Ye Zheng] climbing up the wooden ladder, so he immediately ordered his men to climb up as well. In a panic, [Ye Zheng] kicked off a shoe, and as he was about to be caught, he shouted desperately, "[Ye Wen]!"
0:54:9|0:54:20|Shortly after, [Ye Wen] chased down to the wooden ladder, struck a blow on the back of his opponent, who fell to the ground on the spot. With [Ye Wen] guarding him, [Ye Zheng] climbed to the very top of the wooden ladder.
0:54:24|0:54:44|[Ma Jingsheng] gritted his teeth and roared at Da Wei, causing Da Wei to clutch his stomach and climb up the ladder from the other side. Ye Zheng, who was climbing forward, immediately turned back when he saw it. Suddenly, another person climbed up from behind. Ye Wen quickly stepped on the ladder and jumped up, smashing one of them to the ground. Ye Zheng, seeing this, hurriedly grabbed Ye Wen's waist.
0:54:46|0:54:54|Da Wei saw this scene and quickly jumped down from the ladder by himself, while [Zhang Tianzhi] stood firmly next to the cage outside.
0:55:8|0:55:19|Seeing the police surrounding the shipyard, [Ma Jingsheng] hurried to escape. [Ye Wen] saw this and swung a stick at his back, then he got up and kicked open the window of the factory building.
0:55:47|0:56:22|At this moment, [Sir Bo] raised his head and raised his eyebrows at [Ye Wen], while [Zhang Tianzhi] was handcuffed by the police. [Mrs. Ye] sat at the dining table anxiously holding her head and praying. The mother and son quickly hugged each other and cried out in sorrow. [Ye Wen] walked slowly towards them, unbuttoning the buttons on his coat collar as he walked. He then sat slowly on the chair opposite the mother and son, and after a moment of thought, he spoke.
0:56:33|0:56:44|[Mrs. Ye] let go of [Ye Zheng], slapped [Ye Wen], and [Ye Wen] grabbed [Mrs. Ye]'s hand, comforting her with a touch.
0:56:53|0:57:16|[Mrs. Ye] looked up at [Ye Wen], then withdrew her hand from his, turned around, and went back into the bedroom. Seeing this, [Ye Wen] walked over, embraced [Mrs. Ye]'s neck, and rested his head on her shoulder. After sending [Ye Zheng] away, [Ye Wen] looked guiltily at [Mrs. Ye]'s figure, then stood up and walked towards the direction of the bedroom.
0:57:16|0:57:33|At this moment, [Mrs. Ye] sat on the edge of the bed, crying softly with her chin resting on her left hand. [Ye Wen] first gently touched [Mrs. Ye]'s head, then sat beside her, watching her cry uncontrollably. [Ye Wen] had no choice but to put his arm around her shoulder and rest her head on his shoulder.
0:57:48|0:58:7|[Ye Wen] stopped the gentle patting motion, slowly moved [Mrs. Ye]'s head away from his shoulder, touched her face and asked. [Mrs. Ye] slid her hand down from [Ye Wen]'s chest, took a deep breath, glanced at him, then lowered her head and replied,
0:58:16|0:58:32|[Ye Wen] widened his eyes in shock after hearing it, unable to find words to comfort [Mrs. Ye] for a while. Then [Mrs. Ye] buried her head in [Ye Wen]'s arms, and the two held each other tightly, but [Ye Wen] still couldn't believe this reality.
0:58:40|0:58:52|At this moment, the couple sat across from the [doctor] and listened to the diagnosis. [Ye Wen] first swallowed, then reached out and tightly held [Mrs. Ye]'s hand, the two holding hands firmly.
0:59:10|0:59:33|After hearing the news, the couple walked out of the clinic. [Ye Wen] held [Mrs. Ye]'s hand and firmly placed it on his arm. They then supported each other as they walked out of the hospital. The scene shifted back to their home, where the family of three was sitting around the dining table. Seeing [Mrs. Ye] looking troubled, [Ye Wen] picked up a dish and handed it to her.
0:59:34|1:0:3|Then he picked up his bowl and started eating heartily, [Mrs. Ye] looked at the food in the bowl and then at [Ye Wen]. At this moment, [Ye Wen] slowly put down his chopsticks and turned to look at [Ye Zheng], who was eating happily without noticing anything unusual. [Mrs. Ye] then smiled and reached out her right hand towards [Ye Wen], who also smiled and picked up his bowl to hand it over.
1:0:4|1:0:20|In the past, [Mrs. Ye] took the bowl with a smile on her face, then slowly stood up and walked towards the kitchen behind her. Remembering that the smile on [Mrs. Ye]'s face was obviously forced, [Ye Wen] looked at her figure walking towards the kitchen, lost in thought.
1:0:20|1:0:28|After dinner, [Ye Wen] sat in the living room helping [Ye Zheng] with his homework, while [Mrs. Ye] was washing dishes in the kitchen. As the night grew late,
1:0:28|1:0:53|[Ye Wen] first came to [Ye Zheng]'s room and saw him sleeping soundly. He bent down and gently touched his forehead, then walked out, slowly closed the door, and left [Ye Zheng]'s room. [Ye Wen] returned to the master bedroom, where he was lying in bed with [Mrs. Ye], his left arm passing under [Mrs. Ye]'s neck and tightly holding [Mrs. Ye]'s right hand placed in front of her chest. He lowered his head and looked at [Mrs. Ye].
1:0:53|1:1:9|[Ye Wen] gently shook the hands of the two people, then reached out his right hand from behind, tightly wrapping around [Mrs. Ye]'s shoulder. With eyes wide open until dawn, the scene shifted to the underground black fist market, where two men were practicing kicking.
1:1:49|1:1:55|Sir Bo's superior walked out of the office at this moment.
1:2:11|1:2:26|In a fit of anger, Ferenc knocked [Ma Jingsheng] out of the ring with a punch. Jingsheng, just getting up, heard Ferenc cursing at him to disappear immediately. Jingsheng then left the underground fight market, holding his waist and swaying with protective gear in hand.
1:2:30|1:2:36|The Thai man, after hearing the request, put his hands together and bowed, indicating his understanding. The scene then shifted to the pharmacy.
1:2:36|1:3:2|An elderly lady walked out after picking up her medicine bag. Behind the shop, [Ye Wen] was taking [Mrs. Ye]'s pulse. The couple then walked hand in hand out of the pharmacy, crossed the corridor, and arrived at the elevator to press the button. When the elevator reached the 5th floor, [Ye Wen] opened the elevator door, then pushed open the rolling shutter door. After [Mrs. Ye] entered, [Ye Wen] followed and closed the rolling shutter door.
1:3:2|1:3:29|As the two were about to get on the elevator to go downstairs, a strong hand suddenly blocked the closing elevator door. The camera then panned up, revealing that the owner of this hand was a Thai man. He gave a fierce look at [Ye Wen and his wife] inside the elevator before walking in and turning to face the elevator doors. [Ye Wen] realized the man's hostile intentions and immediately stood in front of him to protect [Mrs. Ye] on his right side.
1:3:29|1:3:50|At this moment, the Thai man first kicked off his slippers, then twisted his neck forcefully. Just as [Ye Wen] handed the medicine packet to [Mrs. Ye] behind him, the Thai man swung his leg back and reached out to kick [Ye Wen]. While using punches and elbows to counter the opponent's attacks, [Ye Wen] also positioned himself to firmly protect [Mrs. Ye] behind him, seeing the opponent suddenly lunge towards [Mrs. Ye].
1:3:50|1:4:0|[Ye Wen] stood up and struck the Thai man's ribs and neck, but the Thai man skillfully dodged and then punched straight towards [Mrs. Ye] again.
1:4:0|1:4:24|[Ye Wen] grabbed the Thai man's forearm, seeing [Mrs. Ye] dropping the medicine bag in fear. [Ye Wen] used his leg to fiercely push against the Thai man's knee. At this moment, the elevator stopped on the third floor. He kicked open the rolling shutter door with one foot and kicked the Thai man into the third-floor corridor. Then [Ye Wen] slowly walked out of the elevator, closing the rolling shutter door and elevator door completely with his hands as he walked.
1:4:25|1:4:51|[Mrs. Ye] looked through the glass on the elevator door at [Ye Wen], frowning, with a worried expression on her face. She then clenched her hands tightly in front of her and sat down in the elevator. Meanwhile, outside the elevator on the third floor, [Ye Wen] used his elbow and lower leg to block the Thai man's frenzied punches and kicks. The Thai man then kicked [Ye Wen] forcefully into the stairwell next to the elevator, as he saw the Thai man lunging towards him.
1:4:51|1:5:19|[Ye Wen] positioned his feet in a pigeon-toed stance, then forcefully punched towards the opponent's collarbone, followed by grabbing his ankle and pulling hard, throwing him to the corner of the stairs. Unexpectedly, the Thai man stood up and pushed [Ye Wen] to the second-floor staircase. [Ye Wen], steadying himself, dodged as the Thai man kicked and shattered the lights of the second-floor TV station. [Ye Wen] gradually retreated step by step until the Thai man reached the second-floor staircase. Seizing the opportunity, he kicked the opponent flying back to the corner of the stairs.
1:5:19|1:5:44|The Thai man refused to stay down and got up again. The two then circled each other on the first-floor staircase, exchanging punches. At this moment, [Ye Wen] grabbed the Thai man's arm, kicked his knee with the other foot, stomped on his foot, and finally hooked his hand and leg, causing the Thai man to fall backwards outside the first-floor elevator door. The opponent got up again, and [Ye Wen] once again used the same move to make the Thai man fall to the ground.
1:5:44|1:6:10|Shortly after, [Ye Wen] looked at the elevator, the Thai man struggled to get up while holding his chest, then limped barefoot out of the corridor. After watching the Thai man walk away, [Ye Wen] slowly turned back. At this moment, the elevator only had its light on. When it stopped, [Ye Wen] opened the elevator door and smiled at Mrs. Ye inside. Mrs. Ye breathed a sigh of relief when she saw that it was [Ye Wen].
1:6:10|1:6:19|Then [Ye Wen] pulled up the curtain and bent down to pick up the medicine packet that had fallen on the ground, then slowly walked out of the elevator holding Mrs. Ye's hand.
1:6:19|1:6:27|At this moment, the camera zooms in on Mrs. Ye tightly holding [Ye Wen]'s left hand, then slowly walking towards the stairs outside, the scene changes.
1:6:27|1:6:34|Sir Bo looked up at the newcomer,
1:6:43|1:7:17|[Ye Wen] sat across from [Sir Bo], nodded after listening, indicating that he understood. Then he smiled at [Sir Bo], who picked up a teacup and took a sip. [Ye Wen] stood up, turned around with a serious expression, and left. At that moment, a qipao-clad woman at the entrance of the Black Fist Market was watching a little girl riding a bike. It turned out that [Ye Wen] had opened the door and walked in.
1:7:17|1:7:40|He first looked down at the little girl, then noticed Frankie practicing boxing in the office next to the stairs. He then walked towards the stairs, unaware that Frankie was punching the boxing target hanging above his head with great force and speed, his biceps as thick as elephant legs, training without blinking an eye.
1:7:42|1:7:50|[Ye Wen] stood behind [Frank] and said seriously. After [Frank] finished listening, he walked towards [Ye Wen].
1:8:26|1:8:44|Then [Ferenc] bowed his head fiercely to pay his respects to [Ye Wen], and placed the alarm clock on the desk. Seeing [Ye Wen] adopting an attacking stance, [Ferenc] clenched his fists and raised them in front of his chest, moving his fists up and down before suddenly thrusting a right punch towards [Ye Wen]'s chest.
1:8:44|1:9:12|[Ye Wen], although using his elbow to block the attack, was still pushed from his original position towards the office desk by the force. Seeing [Frank] coming at him with a fist again, [Ye Wen] jumped directly onto the desk following the opponent's force. Unexpectedly, when he kicked towards [Frank], his ankle was grabbed, and then [Frank] used the momentum to throw [Ye Wen] to the ground. Taking advantage of [Ye Wen] not yet standing firm, [Frank] landed a heavy punch on his ribs, followed by a fierce punch to his cheek.
1:9:12|1:9:34|As [Ye Wen] rose up against [Frank], a sweeping kick fiercely kicked his chest. Both sides, who suffered losses, did not easily throw punches at each other at this moment. Instead, they circled around the sandbag. It was [Frank] who initiated the attack first, throwing a heavy punch towards [Ye Wen]. However, it landed on the sandbag. Then, he forced [Ye Wen] to fight while punching the office glass to pieces.
1:9:39|1:10:3|At this moment, [Ye Wen] was hit repeatedly with heavy punches and caught off guard. He was directly punched in the stomach by [Frank], flying about five meters away. [Ye Wen] took a deep breath, quickly stabilized his body, crossed his hands in front of him, then swept his hands from his waist to the back, palms down, exerting force. Seeing [Ye Wen] with bruises, swollen face, and blood at the corner of his mouth, [Frank] smiled and made a neck-slitting gesture with his index finger.
1:10:3|1:10:13|In this scene, as [Ye Wen] changes his move, he squats down, supporting his body with his right leg while extending his left leg straight and reaching out with both hands, one in front and one behind.
1:11:17|1:11:35|After being hit by [Frank]'s right fist due to lifting it too high, then struck in the stomach and crashing into another piece of glass with a left fist, [Ye Wen] propped up the window and jumped up, kicking [Frank] in the chest with one foot, then extending a kick to the right, sweeping across [Frank]'s right eye, while raising his right leg high and aiming straight for his crotch.
1:11:35|1:11:43|Due to the alarm clock ringing, [Ye Wen] and [Frank] both stopped their attacks, and the little girl also looked towards the office upon hearing the sound.
1:11:43|1:12:11|Therefore, [Ferenc] remembered his promise, could only give up the attack, turned towards the desk, turned off the alarm clock, then with one hand on the desk edge and the other hand on his waist, looked at [Ye Wen]. After locking eyes with him, [Ye Wen] turned around, clenched his fist, and slowly walked out of the office. Although there was no clear winner, [Ferenc] still smiled, watching [Ye Wen] slowly descending the stairs. [Ferenc] also walked to the other side of the stairs.
1:12:25|1:12:32|Then he comforted the little girl by shaking her gently, and while they were talking, [Ye Wen] had already walked down the stairs.
1:12:32|1:12:37|Ye Wen walked out of the black market. The camera then cuts to...
1:13:15|1:13:22|[Zhang Tianzhi] was lost in thought while holding a newspaper in the shop he had been eyeing earlier.
1:13:30|1:13:38|[Ye Wen] showed great power and courageously saved the child, while [Zhang Tianzhi] sat opposite [Journalist Li].
1:14:2|1:14:29|When [Zhang Tianzhi] furrowed his brows, [Journalist Li] returned the newspaper and money to the other party, then picked up a pen and started writing in his notebook. Suddenly, [Zhang Tianzhi] looked up and saw a martial artist entering the teahouse. He then asked [Journalist Li], and upon receiving a positive response, [Zhang Tianzhi] stood up from his seat. Wing Chun [Zhang Tianzhi] wants to exchange pointers with you.
1:14:32|1:14:39|After knocking down his disciple with a single punch, [Zhang Tianzhi] immediately engaged in a confrontation with his master, Ye Wen.
1:14:42|1:15:7|In front of a group of spectators, [Zhang Tianzhi] stood in place and fiercely hammered Master Huang's chest, then slapped him on the chin. Seeing Master Huang attacking him again, [Zhang Tianzhi] lifted his knee and angrily hit his cheek, sending him flying out. He then kicked Master Huang's head towards the wall. With that, [Zhang Tianzhi] gathered his momentum. Just a few days after defeating the first master, [Zhang Tianzhi] began to challenge the second master.
1:15:7|1:15:19|In the teahouse, [Zhang Tianzhi] struck the master's head with his elbow, punched the master's chest, and then pushed the master towards the dining table with his palm. Seeing the master trying to hit him with a ceramic teapot, [Zhang Tianzhi] snatched it and fiercely smashed it towards the master.
1:15:21|1:15:32|A few days later, [Zhang Tianzhi] had a showdown with the third master in the teahouse. With one palm, he sent him flying and then pressed his arm against his chest, exerting force to push him onto the glass table.
1:15:32|1:15:58|On the last day at the teahouse, [Zhang Tianzhi] kicked the fourth master in the chest with his right foot, then kicked him in the head with his left foot. Finally, he smashed the glass table by punching the master's head, accompanied by the loud sound of firecrackers. The Wing Chun martial arts hall officially opened. Journalist Li said to [Zhang Tianzhi] in a silk robe, "..."
1:16:54|1:17:4|Zhang Tianzhi then lifted the cloth covering the plaque next to Teacher Huang, revealing the words "Authentic Wing Chun" written on it.
1:17:9|1:17:19|At this moment, [Ye Wen] sat in the waiting area outside the pharmacy, flipping through a newspaper. He saw [Zhang Tianzhi] openly challenging [Ye Wen] to see whose Wing Chun was more authentic.
1:17:19|1:17:30|Sitting next to him, Mrs. Liu looked worriedly at Ye Wen after reading this article.
1:18:4|1:18:24|[Ye Wen] flipped through the newspaper in his hand and answered with a smile. The scene then shifted to the two of them in the movie theater, looking at [Mrs. Ye] sitting beside them. [Mrs. Ye] smiled sweetly, then linked arms with [Ye Wen]. A few days later, the two of them arrived at the hospital hand in hand. [Ye Wen] handed the paper in his hand to the nurse.
1:18:43|1:18:50|Back at home, the couple sat side by side at the head of the bed. [Mrs. Ye] held a book and spoke to [Ye Wen].
1:18:57|1:19:4|[Zhang Tianzhi] stood with his hands behind his back, giving instructions to the apprentices in the grand martial arts hall under renovation.
1:19:6|1:19:20|[Zhang Tianzhi] embraced [Zhang Feng], leading the apprentices to the teahouse, then pointed to Master Ye's table, while [Ye Wen] walked through the corridor to a ballroom where a man was dancing passionately.
1:19:56|1:20:0|Li Xiaolong lowered his head for a moment, then raised his thumb and turned on the sound system.
1:20:0|1:20:5|The calendar flips to the 15th day, inside [Zhang Tianzhi]'s martial arts school,
1:20:44|1:21:3|[Ye Wen] extended his right hand with a smile on his face, [Mrs. Ye] blushed and then placed her left hand on [Ye Wen]'s right hand. Under the gaze of everyone, the couple held hands and happily danced in the center of the ballroom. They then changed positions, facing each other with a back-and-forth movement, smiling happily to the music.
1:21:3|1:21:28|On the other side, the chair belonging to [Ye Wen] in [Zhang Tianzhi]'s martial arts school was still empty. The clock on the stool showed that it was almost 3 o'clock, unlike the anxious [Sir Bo] and [Tian Aoshan] in the school. [Ye Wen] was dancing happily with [Mrs. Ye], swaying his hands back and forth after spinning in place at the beginning of the excitement, with his head held high, amusing [Mrs. Ye].
1:22:4|1:22:18|Journalist Li stood in front of many reporters holding a notebook and asked, as Zhang Tianzhi stepped forward.
1:23:6|1:23:32|It was not [Tian Aoshan] who rushed to stop it, fearing that he would have to fight with [Xu Li] and others. On this side of the dance hall, [Ye Wen] seemed to have no intention of fighting, but was smiling happily with his eyes half closed and mouth open. Little did he know that Mrs. [Ye], who was also smiling happily, suddenly closed her eyes and fell forward. [Ye Wen] took a quick step to catch her, but Mrs. [Ye] did not open her eyes.
1:23:37|1:23:54|[Ye Wen] held her upper body, helplessly shouting at the people in the ballroom. After the doctor informed [Ye Wen] in the hospital corridor, he turned and left.
1:23:54|1:24:3|Mrs. Ye, who had fainted in the ward, weakly opened her eyes and woke up, but then turned her head and fell back asleep. Outside the ward, [Ye Wen]
1:24:3|1:24:7|After listening to the doctor's advice, [Ye Wen] sat blankly in the chair.
1:24:7|1:24:15|In the empty corridor, [Ye Wen] stared out of the window at the sun without moving for a long time. [Ye Wen] entered the hospital room.
1:24:15|1:24:22|Supporting himself on the bedside, Ye Wen smiled and asked Mrs. Ye while touching her forehead.
1:24:31|1:24:45|Lying on the hospital bed, Mrs. Ye blinked her eyes and looked at [Ye Wen], nodding slightly. [Ye Wen] moved his hand to Mrs. Ye's head, touched her hair, and managed to force a smile.
1:24:45|1:24:50|Furrowing his brow, Zhang Tianzhi looks at Mrs. Ye who has fallen asleep. Days pass by one by one.
1:24:50|1:24:55|[Ye Wen] comes to the hospital every day with a thermos to bring food to Mrs. Ye.
1:24:55|1:25:4|At this moment in the kitchen at home, [Ye Wen] is cooking soup in a clay pot, tasting it for seasoning before ladling it into a thermal container.
1:25:4|1:25:10|Ye Wen then came to the ward, sat across from Mrs. Ye, and fed her the soup one spoonful at a time.
1:25:11|1:25:33|A few days later, [Ye Wen] walked into the hospital room holding hands with Ye Zheng who had just finished school, carrying a thermos in one hand. Inside the room, [Mrs. Ye] was holding Ye Zheng with one hand and helping him with his homework with the other. When father and son were not by her side at night, [Mrs. Ye] took out an envelope and wrote a letter addressed to [Zhang Tianzhi].
1:25:51|1:26:1|[Mrs. Ye] was rolling in pain on the hospital bed, covered in sweat on her forehead. [Ye Wen] looked at his weak [Mrs. Ye] and blew on the soup in the bowl.
1:26:8|1:26:36|[Mrs. Ye] took a sip with a spoon and choked on it. Seeing this, [Ye Wen] quickly picked up a handkerchief to wipe [Mrs. Ye]'s mouth, then placed the bowl on the table next to the sickbed. Finally, he tightly held [Mrs. Ye]'s left hand resting on the blanket. At this moment, [Mrs. Ye] took a deep breath, drooping her eyelids, and said to [Ye Wen]. After speaking, [Mrs. Ye] continued to gasp for air.
1:26:36|1:26:43|The rise and fall of the chest could not be eased. [Ye Wen] heard such a request and stared tightly at the face of [Mrs. Ye].
1:26:43|1:27:7|When he saw [Mrs. Ye] force a smile with the corners of her mouth, he couldn't help but sniff, then clenched his teeth, blinked, lowered his head to control his emotions, looked at [Mrs. Ye] again, [Ye Wen] finally couldn't hold back, trembling chin, quietly cried. At this moment, his emotions completely collapsed, pinching the bridge of his nose with his hand.
1:27:7|1:27:10|Then he shook his head forcefully and tears streamed down his face.
1:27:10|1:27:16|On the day of the shoot, with lipstick on her lips, [Mrs. Ye] had her left arm around Ye Zheng, with [Ye Wen] standing behind them.
1:27:16|1:27:24|A family of three smiled happily at the camera in the studio. Then it was [Mrs. Ye]'s turn for a solo shoot.
1:27:24|1:27:30|Watching her sitting on the pillar chair trying to cheer up, [Ye Wen] stood next to the camera and pursed his lips.
1:27:30|1:27:44|After leaving the film studio, [Mrs. Ye] and [Ye Wen] arrived at the fifth-floor room seen at the beginning of the movie. At this moment, [Mrs. Ye] was staring intently at the wooden dummy in the depths of the room, as this was where [Ye Wen] taught at his martial arts school.
1:28:34|1:28:48|[Mrs. Ye] leaned on the table with her right elbow, turned her head to [Ye Wen], and whispered softly. Then her chest heaved up and down, she closed her eyes, and started breathing heavily.
1:28:52|1:29:0|[Ye Wen] thought for a moment and then earnestly said to [Mrs. Ye], bending slightly at the waist. [Mrs. Ye] smiled and replied,
1:29:5|1:29:37|[Mrs. Ye] stared at [Ye Wen] intently, asking the question she had in her heart. [Ye Wen] didn't answer immediately. He first looked into [Mrs. Ye]'s eyes, then lowered his head and sighed deeply. After that, [Ye Wen] raised his head, blinked hard, glanced at the ceiling, and spoke. Then he turned his head to look at [Mrs. Ye] seriously. Smiling, [Mrs. Ye] said to [Ye Wen],
1:29:43|1:29:54|[Ye Wen] did not show much reaction to the challenge, still gazing affectionately at [Mrs. Ye]. [Mrs. Ye] glanced at the wooden dummy opposite her, then spoke,
1:30:6|1:30:26|[Mrs. Ye] first rubbed [Ye Wen]'s hand against her cheek, then slowly raised her left hand to hold his. After [Ye Wen] pinched [Mrs. Ye]'s chin, he stood up from the chair and walked towards the wooden dummy behind him. He then struck a pose and entered practice mode. Watching [Ye Wen] punching, [Mrs. Ye] once again showed a happy smile.
1:30:26|1:30:40|At this moment, [Ye Wen] extends his arms towards the wooden dummy at his own height, attacking the two upper arms, one lower arm, and a leg on the dummy, perfectly simulating the enemy's four limb structure.
1:30:40|1:30:46|Under the gaze of [Mrs. Ye], [Ye Wen] alternates between using his palms and arms to strike these positions.
1:30:46|1:31:0|At this moment, [Ye Wen] stopped his attacking movements, placed his arms on the two wooden posts, clenched his fists tightly, gritted his teeth, then stood up straight and repeated the same movements as before.
1:31:0|1:31:22|The setting sun shone through the window, with only the sound of [Ye Wen] hitting the wooden dummy echoing in the martial arts hall where the couple was present. In the environment of moldy walls and peeling paint, only the wooden dummy was exceptionally shiny. Sitting on a stool, [Mrs. Ye] bent over in pain, but still managed to support her body and look up at [Ye Wen] who was punching.
1:31:22|1:31:26|The two of them stayed in the martial arts school until the sun went down.
1:31:26|1:31:43|On a stormy night, [Ye Wen] arrived at the entrance of [Zhang Tianzhi]'s martial arts school with an umbrella and Mrs. Ye. He closed the umbrella at the half-open gate and then walked into the school with Mrs. Ye. The plaques on both sides of the school gate read,
1:31:43|1:31:49|The true kung fu passed down through the ages, upholding martial arts to strengthen the spirit of China. At this moment,
1:31:49|1:32:8|[Ye Wen] brought Mrs. Ye to a screen, had her sit on a chair, tidied her wet hair blown by the rain, leaned the umbrella against the table, then looked inside through the screen. [Zhang Tianzhi] picked up three incense sticks, lit them with the lamp wick, extended his arm straight, and held them parallel to his brow.
1:32:8|1:32:34|Facing him are three plaques, with the largest one in the middle bearing the title of the ancestral shrine of past masters. Looking at [Zhang Tianzhi] who claims to be the authentic Wing Chun successor, [Ye Wen] gently pats Mrs. Ye's hand. At this moment, [Zhang Tianzhi] closes his eyes, holds up incense, bows to the shrine, then inserts the incense into the censer. On the other side, [Ye Wen] neatly folds the removed gown and hands it to Mrs. Ye.
1:32:34|1:32:43|Walking towards [Zhang Tianzhi] with her concerns, at this moment [Zhang Tianzhi] heard a voice and turned around from the memorial tablet.
1:32:43|1:33:11|Seeing [Ye Wen] slowly walking in from the main entrance, [Zhang Tianzhi] also walked towards him, raising his arm as he walked, rolling up the sleeve of his robe. [Ye Wen] did the same, and after both had finished adjusting their sleeves, they stood face to face in the center of the martial arts hall. [Zhang Tianzhi] clasped his hands in front of him and [Ye Wen] returned the gesture in the same manner.
1:33:13|1:33:23|Mrs. Ye, sitting with her back against the screen, listened to their greetings, staring blankly ahead, then touched the overcoat on her lap.
1:33:24|1:33:37|At this moment, [Ye Wen] and [Zhang Tianzhi] each held a stick about three meters long, facing each other. They then kicked the bottom of the sticks together, and with a single hand turning into both hands, they swung them horizontally.
1:33:37|1:34:5|[Zhang Tianzhi] slammed the tip of the stick on the ground, bounced it up towards [Ye Wen], with [Ye Wen] holding the stick horizontally in front of his chest, dragging the lower end with his right hand and pointing the upper end towards [Zhang Tianzhi] with his left hand. [Zhang Tianzhi] initiated the attack first, stabbing directly at [Ye Wen]'s head with the stick tip. After being blocked by [Ye Wen] with a side hit, the two spun around each other in the center of the martial arts hall, exchanging attacks. As the fight intensified, [Ye Wen] pierced a wooden pillar behind [Zhang Tianzhi] with a strike.
1:34:6|1:34:27|[Zhang Tianzhi] showed no weakness, with a strong swing he split open a crack in the cement wall under the wooden pillar, then the two of them took a few steps to the tea table. [Ye Wen] dodged [Zhang Tianzhi]'s incoming strike and then turned around to strike his stick, shattering the tea table below. Neither side gained an advantage, and they faced off again with their sticks raised.
1:34:27|1:34:42|At this moment, [Ye Wen] launched an attack, but each strike was countered by [Zhang Tianzhi]. The two of them then exerted all their strength to swing at each other, causing their sticks to break into two pieces. [Mrs. Ye] slowly closed her eyes.
