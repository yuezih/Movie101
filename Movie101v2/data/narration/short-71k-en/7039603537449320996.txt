0:1:29|0:1:38|[Sun Wukong] nibbled on a crispy peach in his hand, then tossed it out. The peach spun rapidly and hit Li Tianwang.
0:1:38|0:1:46|Li Tianwang was knocked into the air and somersaulted. The giant spirit god, as tall as the sky, rose up with a bang.
0:1:46|0:1:54|Swinging his divine axe, he struck towards [Sun Wukong], but when he looked closely, he saw no trace of [Sun Wukong].
0:1:54|0:2:1|He was just about to lift his head when he was kicked down by [Sun Wukong] descending from the sky, [Sun Wukong] spiraled up into the air.
0:2:2|0:2:7|Nezha aimed his Red Tassel Spear directly at [Sun Wukong], but only grazed the Golden Cudgel and his armor.
0:2:7|0:2:15|Nezha rides the Wind Fire Wheels, holding the Red Tassel Spear, fighting against [Sun Wukong] in the air, while the Heavenly King of Chi Guo plays the pipa with a flick of his finger.
0:2:15|0:2:20|[Sun Wukong] was immediately knocked back by the sound waves. The Great Sage Equal to Heaven released the green snake coiled around him,
0:2:20|0:2:31|The giant snake opened its bloody mouth and lunged towards [Sun Wukong], only to be thrown off the cloud by him. Erlang Shen, seeing this, drew his bow and shot a golden arrow into the sky, causing an instant explosion, but [Sun Wukong] leaped down from the clouds.
0:2:31|0:2:43|Transformed into a red fish. Erlang Shen immediately raised his commanding finger, waved his arms, transformed into a white-browed eagle, flew past several heavenly kings, plunged into the sea of clouds, and grabbed towards the red fish with his two eagle claws.
0:2:43|0:2:49|The red fish leaped out of the clouds, transformed into a swallow, and narrowly escaped from the eagle's claws.
0:2:50|0:3:0|General Li Tianwang gave the order, and thousands of arrows shot through the clouds, aiming at [Sun Wukong]. [Sun Wukong]'s pupils contracted sharply, turning into a ball of fire that exploded, defeating the heavenly soldiers and generals in the clouds.
0:3:0|0:3:8|[Sun Wukong] grabbed Li Tianwang's beard and threw him down to the mortal world.
0:3:10|0:3:20|Buddhist scripture seals the wrist of [Sun Wukong], and he is struck down from the Heavenly Palace by the palm of the Tathagata.
0:3:33|0:3:40|The mother bent down to kiss the baby in her arms, while the father stood up and looked at the convoy.
0:3:52|0:4:0|On the steep mountain road, there is a continuous line of vehicles. The wooden cart carrying the baby hits a rock, almost falling off the cliff.
0:4:0|0:4:9|The mother held the baby tightly. A mountain demon climbed down.
0:4:13|0:4:15|The mountain demon pushed the people off the cliff. The mother held the baby and the cart driver turned back along the original path.
0:4:16|0:4:25|Unexpectedly, another mountain demon jumped down from the mountain on the opposite side. The mother screamed and protected the child in her arms, while the father's attention was drawn away by the child's crying.
0:4:25|0:4:33|The mountain demon took advantage of his unpreparedness, pounced fiercely, the father raised his sword to meet it, slashing through the chest of the mountain demon, but was knocked down by the successive attacks of the mountain demon.
0:4:34|0:4:41|The mother was about to run, but a mountain demon slowly rose in front of her, leaving her helpless and sitting paralyzed on the ground.
0:4:41|0:4:49|The mountain demon gathered from all directions, the child in her arms looked at her innocently, holding a puppet of [Sun Wukong]. The mother looked up.
0:4:49|0:5:3|The father has died on the mountain road. With a frown on her face, she suddenly grabbed the child and ran to the edge of the cliff, then leaped off. The mountain demons hurriedly reached out but caught nothing, and the mother and child fell into the misty bottom of the cliff.
0:5:3|0:5:16|In a valley, lush with vegetation, a river flows quietly between two mountains. Wearing a bamboo hat and long white beard, [Fa Ming] scoops up a handful of water by the river. Suddenly, he hears the cry of a baby.
0:5:16|0:5:21|Broken pieces of wood drifted on the river surface.
0:5:23|0:5:29|[Fa Ming] hurriedly walked into the river and picked up the baby in the basket.
0:5:31|0:5:44|The baby's spit and snot sprayed all over [Fa Ming], who then held the baby in his arms.
0:5:45|0:5:48|[Fa Ming] carries the child ashore,
0:5:48|0:5:54|Glancing back towards the source of the river, he walked into the deep and beautiful valley once again. The camera panned up.
0:5:56|0:6:4|Above the valley is a clear and calm sky, with the title "The Monkey King: The Hero is Back" appearing in the air.
0:6:4|0:6:14|[Fa Ming] arrived at a mountain stronghold, holding up a baby to the guards on the gate tower for inquiry. After they shook their heads, he carried the baby on his back, leaned on a cane, and traversed mountains and rivers.
0:6:14|0:6:17|On a stormy night, [Fa Ming] takes refuge in a cave with a baby.
0:6:19|0:6:25|He lit a fire in the cave, feeding the baby with water from the iron pot next to him using his fingers. A blizzard arrived.
0:6:25|0:6:32|[Fa Ming], carrying a baby on his back, walks laboriously on the snowy mountain, facing the raging snowflakes.
0:6:32|0:6:39|It's all a vast expanse of white. A winding river flows through the boundless fields.
0:6:42|0:6:54|The child joyfully welcomes the breeze, arms wide open. In the dense jungle, the child follows [Fa Ming] unsteadily, accidentally falling into the grass. [Fa Ming] quickly turns around to help him up.
0:6:54|0:6:59|The child got up on his own and continued to walk unsteadily step by step.
0:6:59|0:7:10|Several years later, a shadow play of [Sun Wukong] battling the Four Great Heavenly Kings is being performed on a white screen.
0:7:32|0:7:39|[Jiang Liuer] breaks free from the shadow puppeteer and quickly slips away.
0:7:39|0:7:54|In the evening in Chang'an City, as the lights gradually brighten and peach blossoms bloom on the branches, [Jiang Liuer] paints Sun Wukong's face on the eaves and jumps around recklessly. He steps on a stone that hits the uncle, causing his dentures to fly out and fall into the soup.
0:7:57|0:8:6|[Jiang Liuer] wielded his staff, pointing it at a small yellow dog on the ground. He ran around with the staff in hand, but accidentally bumped into [Fa Ming].
0:8:12|0:8:17|[Jiang Liuer] raised the bowl in her hand and the passerby cooperatively tossed a copper coin into it.
0:8:51|0:8:58|[Fa Ming] is dressed in tattered clothes, with a hole in his worn-out shoes.
0:9:42|0:9:46|A sudden thunderstorm arrived, and it started to rain heavily in the city like drumbeats.
0:9:46|0:9:52|[Fa Ming] walked down the stone bridge with a cane, while [Jiang Liuer] looked up at the sky, rainwater running down his face.
0:9:52|0:9:58|Sliding into the neck. The leaves after the rain were shining, with water droplets beating on the leaves and falling quickly.
0:9:58|0:10:8|Insects chirped as they fluttered their wings, leaves weighed down branches and pierced the calm river surface, and a giant claw shattered the tranquility of the moment.
0:10:12|0:10:19|A volley of arrows fell from the sky, all stuck in the hillside not far away, with the leading female mountain demon giving orders.
0:10:22|0:10:28|The mountain demons around her rushed out instantly, knocking her left and right. The demons attacked the city wall.
0:10:28|0:10:34|Toppling the archer behind, the other archer was slapped away by the mountain demon, crashing through the roof of a household.
0:10:34|0:10:43|The parents in the house held their child tightly, and then the mountain demon burst in.
0:10:56|0:11:1|A mountain demon runs from the roof, holding a little girl in her left hand.
0:11:2|0:11:8|He was suddenly hit by a flowerpot, before he could react, he was hit by a pot of cactus.
0:11:8|0:11:14|The [Mountain Demon] saw Jiang Liuer upstairs and was about to pounce, but was stunned by a door slamming shut.
0:11:17|0:11:24|[Fa Ming] was hit by Jiang Liuer's water bucket and fell to the ground, just as the little girl thrown by the Mountain Demon landed on him.
0:11:34|0:11:42|A large group of [Mountain Demons] followed behind them. The [Mountain Demons] jumped off the roof and climbed onto a stone lion, but Jiang Liuer and the others were nowhere to be seen.
0:11:42|0:11:48|The stone ball that the lion stepped on turned into a trembling bald head. [Mountain Demon] looked around.
0:11:48|0:11:55|Discovering another stone lion with three balls underneath, [Fa Ming] pushed over the stone lion when Jiang Liuer was exposed.
0:12:3|0:12:12|Jiang Liuer fled with the little girl in her arms, but several Mountain Demons crawled in front of them. She hurriedly turned into a narrow alley, where a Mountain Demon jumped down from above, only to fall into a bamboo basket.
0:12:12|0:12:28|Jiang Liuer ran on the flying bamboo raft, dodging the attacking [Mountain Demon], but then jumped down from the high bamboo basket above. He landed on the tile roof below, slid down from the roof, and stopped at the eaves, with a deep valley beneath his feet.
0:12:28|0:12:39|The female [Mountain Demon] slid down, lifted up Jiang Liuer and the little girl, but the other [Mountain Demons] behind her didn't stop in time, knocking her off the roof. Suddenly, a tree barrel flew out of the valley.
0:12:39|0:12:54|[Jiang Liuer] is holding a little girl, sliding down the barren village at the bottom of the valley on a tree bucket. The mountain demon also rolls down from the hillside, grabbing the clothesline in the middle of the house and sliding all the way, covered by a bright bedsheet, and then crashing into a household.
0:12:54|0:13:7|The branches tore through the mountain demon's bedsheet-like clothing, leaving him looking like he was wearing a bikini. The demon tumbled to the ground, knocking over several bamboo baskets, one of which landed on [Jiang Liuer]'s head. Seizing the opportunity, the demon snatched the little girl and flung her away.
0:13:7|0:13:13|[Jiang Liuer] slid into the air on a tree bucket, caught the little girl in a bamboo basket, and then fell into a deeper valley.
0:13:13|0:13:24|Jiang Liuer continued to slide down the dark valley in the tree barrel, with the mountain demons still in hot pursuit. [Jiang Liuer] stepped on the tree barrel and made a sharp turn at the edge of the cliff, catching a mountain demon off guard as it flew out of the cliff.
0:13:24|0:13:32|The towering stone pillars bounced around unexpectedly, knocking [Jiang Liuer] and the female mountain demon behind her, both falling into the abyss.
0:13:33|0:13:41|The mountain demon handed over a bamboo basket, but inside was a beehive.
0:13:43|0:13:52|The female mountain demon angrily smashed her subordinates with a beehive, and they were immediately surrounded by bees, causing the two demons to flee in panic.
0:13:52|0:14:0|The faint glow of fireflies flew out, illuminating the huge stone under the tree roots, where a side-lying stone statue face was located.
0:14:0|0:14:9|A firefly fluttered its wings and flew out of the valley, heading towards the distant mountains shaped like five fingers. [Fa Ming] looked around in the white mist.
0:14:14|0:14:18|The valley is tranquil, with lush vegetation.
0:14:18|0:14:24|A butterfly flutters away from a leaf. A ground deity resembling a squirrel with white beard emerges from the ground.
0:14:24|0:14:35|He looked up at the stone wall, five or six earth gods following [Jiang Liuer] as she climbed up. [Jiang Liuer] struggled to carry the little girl up the hill, and the earth gods saw him coming up.
0:14:35|0:14:40|[Jiang Liuer] jumped forward. She looked up and saw a huge peach tree in front of her.
0:14:40|0:14:51|The tree is full of peaches. While looking, [Jiang Liuer] noticed a peach on the ground, so she picked it up and put it in her basket. There were peaches all over the ground, and [Jiang Liuer] couldn't pick them all up.
0:14:51|0:14:59|Several land deities carried peaches to him. Behind him, three land deities carried three peaches but couldn't stand steadily, clumsily falling to the ground.
0:14:59|0:15:12|Beside him, the Land God threw the peaches towards his basket but missed, and the peaches rolled into a puddle, which turned out to be the footprint of a mountain demon. [Jiang Liuer] was so scared that she dropped the peaches in her arms and rolled away.
0:15:12|0:15:17|Hundun hides on the ground under the tree roots. The tree canopy not far away starts to shake.
0:15:20|0:15:27|A mountain demon flew out from the tree, and [Jiang Liuer] quickly climbed up the peach tree. Peaches fell down one after another, blocking the demon's eyes.
0:15:27|0:15:36|[Jiang Liuer] climbed up along the peach tree, slipped into a stone cave next to the tree trunk, turned back to pick up the lost shoe, only to have his hand pierced by the mountain demon's claw.
0:15:36|0:15:44|Watching the mountain demon at the cave entrance, unable to enter due to its ferocity, [Jiang Liuer] hurriedly put on her shoes and ran towards the depths of the cave.
0:15:44|0:15:49|[Jiang Liuer] is carrying a little girl on her back, walking slowly in the cave.
0:15:49|0:15:56|The blood on his hand back dripped onto the ground, shining a ring of blood light, spreading out in the cave.
0:15:59|0:16:8|[Jiang Liuer] suddenly stepped into a hole and slipped down. He shakily stood up, squinted ahead, and took two more steps forward.
0:16:8|0:16:19|In front of them is a huge stone pillar emitting a dazzling cold light, with its surface uneven and bound by iron chains all around.
0:16:19|0:16:33|In the cave, the stone walls are covered with Buddha statues. [Jiang Liuer] sticks a stone flower on it, takes a few steps back, and bumps into the palm print protruding from the stone pillar. The entire stone pillar is covered with scattered palm prints, and he aligns his hand with one of the prints.
0:16:33|0:16:41|With a muffled sound, [Jiang Liuer] pulled back his hand and turned to walk forward.
0:16:41|0:16:55|The palm print cracked, spreading upwards and across the entire pillar. [Jiang Liuer] clasped her hands together in prayer before the Buddha statue, unaware that the pillar behind her was about to collapse.
0:16:55|0:17:4|Cracks rapidly spread across the surrounding Buddha statues, a iron chain breaks and falls down, [Jiang Liuer] falls down, narrowly escaping, and the stone pillar instantly explodes.
0:17:10|0:17:24|Rocks kept collapsing, [Jiang Liuer] held the little girl and hid to the side, but soon they were buried by stones, everything fell silent. The cave was filled with dust, and rocks and debris were everywhere.
0:17:24|0:17:40|[Jiang Liuer] slowly got up, spitting out saliva, and noticed the little girl in front of him. He quickly lifted the bamboo basket containing the little girl out of the rocks. [Jiang Liuer] turned his head and saw several mountain demons crawling out of the cracks in the cave.
0:17:40|0:17:47|He grabbed the bamboo basket and ran, while the female mountain demon hurriedly chased after him.
0:17:47|0:17:58|[Jiang Liuer] ran to the place where the stone pillar exploded, jumped onto the iron chain, and climbed upwards. The iron chain swayed in the air, almost colliding with the mountain demon chasing from behind. Suddenly, a stone slab stood up from the pile of rocks.
0:17:58|0:18:5|The mountain demon crashed heavily onto the stone slab, rolled three times, and then fell to the ground unable to get up.
0:18:5|0:18:8|A hairy hand suddenly emerged from the pile of rocks.
0:18:8|0:18:19|Mao grabbed a rock, propped himself up, and [Sun Wukong] climbed out of the pile of stones in tattered clothes. He stretched his neck, noticing the mountain demons around him.
0:18:23|0:18:36|[Sun Wukong] watched as the mountain demon pounced towards him, swiftly dodged to the side, and the demon crashed into a rock. [Sun Wukong] realized that his hands were still chained, and he was momentarily dumbfounded.
0:18:36|0:18:37|The female mountain demon rushed over quickly.
0:18:38|0:18:48|[Sun Wukong] kicked the stones off his body, causing the female mountain demon to be hit and spit flying everywhere. He jumped up and spun rapidly in the air, swinging his iron chain at the surrounding mountain demons.
0:18:48|0:18:53|The iron chains lifted the stones, and the mountain demons were all knocked into the stone wall.
0:18:53|0:19:7|[Sun Wukong] grinned and looked around, then turned to stare at [Jiang Liuer]. [Jiang Liuer] gripped the iron chain tightly, looking at him in fear, with snot running down her face. [Sun Wukong] was drawn to [Jiang Liuer]'s snot.
0:19:7|0:19:16|[Jiang Liuer] found that snot had dripped onto her mouth, so she quickly sucked it back in. The little girl climbed out of the basket on her back and patted [Sun Wukong]'s monkey head.
0:19:17|0:19:22|[Sun Wukong] turned around and walked away, raising his hand to retrieve the iron chain, but was hit in the face by the iron chain.
0:19:22|0:19:29|Jiang Liuer's snot dripped down and landed right in the mouth of the mountain demon, who then licked around their mouth with their tongue.
0:19:29|0:19:34|[Jiang Liuer] hurriedly carried the little girl on her back and ran away from the cave.
0:19:34|0:19:46|[Sun Wukong] is jumping around in the forest as if reborn. He slides on tree trunks, grabs branches to loop in the air, then instantly shoots out and flies towards the tallest tree in the jungle.
0:19:56|0:20:5|He looked proudly over the scenery of the entire valley, gazed at the dazzling sun in the distance, took a few running steps, and dashed towards the sky.
0:20:5|0:20:9|Sun Wukong's right hand suddenly glowed with a seal.
0:20:9|0:20:20|He fell from the sky. [Sun Wukong] rolled all the way and landed by a pond.
0:20:20|0:20:29|He held down his glowing right hand, lifted a stone, and smashed it towards the seal on his right hand, but the seal remained unaffected.
0:20:29|0:20:33|[Sun Wukong] was furious, crazily smashing the rocks with his right hand, sparks flying everywhere.
0:20:33|0:20:43|[Jiang Liuer] heard a noise and hid nearby to observe [Sun Wukong]. [Sun Wukong] saw the reflection on [Fa Ming]'s body and realized that behind him was a statue of the Buddha.
0:20:43|0:20:50|He stood up with a cold smile.
0:21:19|0:21:24|[Jiang Liuer] hurried to catch up, but didn't know which direction [Sun Wukong] had gone.
0:21:24|0:21:31|A land god with a cherry in his mouth winked at him, and [Jiang Liuer] turned around and bowed.
0:21:32|0:21:44|The Earth God looked at the back of [Jiang Liuer] as she left, measured the land with his feet, then jumped up and disappeared into the underworld, leaving behind a cloud of white smoke. [Jiang Liuer] followed closely behind.
0:21:46|0:21:53|He struggled to climb over the moss-covered tree stump, [Sun Wukong] saw this and quickly hid behind a big tree, chuckling to himself.
0:21:53|0:22:2|[Sun Wukong] looks at [Jiang Liuer], who is carrying a little girl on her back with two small braids on her head.
0:22:3|0:22:9|[Jiang Liuer] and [Sun Wukong] walked side by side, holding onto the back rope, and asked,
0:22:15|0:22:24|[Sun Wukong] quickly jumped onto the small hill behind him. [Jiang Liuer] looked around.
0:22:27|0:22:33|[Sun Wukong] looked around the road in surprise.
0:23:1|0:23:8|[Sun Wukong] listened contentedly, with his hands folded behind his head.
0:23:40|0:23:49|[Sun Wukong] loses control and punches down the big tree next to him.
0:24:8|0:24:15|Suddenly, behind the two, came the sound of rocks rolling down the mountain, followed by a violent shaking of the earth.
0:24:15|0:24:28|[Sun Wukong] stared at the woods behind him, clenched his fists. A huge and incomparable stone man leaped into the air,
0:24:29|0:24:33|His roar echoed through the valley, startling a group of forest birds.
0:25:10|0:25:23|[Mountain God] descended from the sky, blocking his way, leaping up from the ground, and delivering a heavy blow to him. [Sun Wukong] agilely leaped around, but was punched into a giant rock by [Mountain God], who then swung his fist down.
0:25:23|0:25:28|[Sun Wukong] jumped onto the head of [Mountain God] and delivered a flashy kick that sent him rolling far away.
0:25:28|0:25:37|[Sun Wukong] clenched his fist in excitement, while [Fa Ming] suddenly emitted a bright light and fell to the ground in pain. A huge rock fell from the canyon, narrowly missing [Jiang Liuer].
0:25:38|0:25:47|He ran behind the rocks next to [Sun Wukong] to hide. The stones on the ground rolled and gathered on the right fist of [Mountain God].
0:25:47|0:25:59|[Mountain God] lifted the huge rock that had just fallen down. [Sun Wukong] looked at the sky-blocking rock in confusion, but luckily dodged in time. He somersaulted backwards to avoid [Mountain God]'s left fist.
0:26:0|0:26:9|He was hit by the Mountain God in mid-air and rolled tens of meters away. Sun Wukong grabbed a nearby rock, stood up, and shook off the dust from his body.
0:26:12|0:26:23|The Mountain God pushed aside the blocking stones and charged towards Sun Wukong like a hungry beast. Sun Wukong quickly leaped left and right among the rocks in the canyon, then jumped back to the ground, using all four limbs.
0:26:23|0:26:30|Running forward. Ahead is a cliff, [Sun Wukong] leaps down.
0:26:30|0:26:35|He hooked the thick branches on the cliff edge with an iron chain, broke the branches, and then leaped into the air.
0:26:35|0:26:49|[Sun Wukong] sat on the back of the [Mountain God]. Suddenly, the [Mountain God] became agitated, turned around, and ran towards a steep cliff. He slammed his back against the rock wall, [Sun Wukong] agilely jumped away. The [Mountain God] caught up and pushed him to the edge of the cliff.
0:26:49|0:26:57|[Sun Wukong] uses both hands to block the right fist of [Mountain God]. [Jiang Liuer] sees the talisman fluttering behind [Mountain God] in the wind.
0:26:57|0:27:9|He took off the bamboo basket carrying the little girl on his back, instructing [Jiang Liuer] to run all the way, jump onto the back of the [Mountain God], and reach out to grab the talisman within reach.
0:27:9|0:27:16|[Mountain God] noticed a little something on his body and turned to look at it. Seeing the opportunity, [Sun Wukong] immediately released his hands.
0:27:17|0:27:28|The Mountain God and Jiang Liuer fell off the cliff together. Sun Wukong was about to leave, but was pulled down by an iron chain. The Mountain God climbed up with Sun Wukong's iron chain, while Sun Wukong was only holding onto a vine.
0:27:28|0:27:35|Hanging on the edge of a cliff, [Mountain God] suddenly twisted uneasily, and [Jiang Liuer] climbed up his back.
0:27:37|0:27:44|[Jiang Liuer] held up the freshly torn talisman, causing the entire body of [Mountain God] to tremble violently.
0:27:47|0:27:56|The Mountain God exploded into countless pieces of rubble, falling into the abyss, and Jiang Liuer also fell down the deep cliff. In the rugged valley,
0:27:56|0:28:8|The wind and snow are raging, with the cold wind howling. The mountain tunnel leads to a huge and incomparable cave, where four bruised and swollen mountain demons are lying on the huge tree roots that pierce through the rocks, standing in front of them.
0:28:8|0:28:15|It's the demon king [Hundun].
0:28:30|0:28:37|Hundun waved his sleeve, and the reflections of two mountain demons on the rock wall turned into a man and a woman.
0:28:38|0:28:51|[Jiang Liuer] woke up coughing, grabbing the two sharp teeth of the unknown creature in front of him with both hands. He opened his eyes and was scared away by the big mouth in front of him. It turned out to be a big fish being roasted over the fire.
0:29:21|0:29:36|[Jiang Liuer] leaned against the giant rock, [Sun Wukong] winced in pain and quickly tore off a piece of fish to chew, trying to distract himself. He noticed [Jiang Liuer] looking at him, so he handed the meat over to her.
0:29:58|0:30:7|[Sun Wukong]'s foot swelled twice its size. [Jiang Liuer] kicked away the pebbles at his feet, sending them bouncing far across the lake. He kicked another one, and that pebble,
0:30:7|0:30:15|Sun Wukong approached, and with a quick move, the boulder smashed down on his foot again.
0:30:17|0:30:24|[Jiang Liuer] smashed a fist into the giant rock, causing [Sun Wukong] to jump up in pain, only able to tremble and ask while lying on the stone,
0:30:34|0:30:46|The little girl climbed onto the roasted fish's belly, [Jiang Liuer] stepped on the branch holding the vine, a huge rock fell to the ground, [Sun Wukong] was bounced into the air and then fell heavily, hanging on the tree trunk.
0:30:54|0:31:5|Suddenly, a figure flashed behind [Jiang Liuer]. He turned at the sound, carefully weaving through the tree trunks, and discovered a temple built on a stone platform.
0:31:7|0:31:11|[Sun Wukong] grimaced in pain as he covered his ears. [Jiang Liuer] pushed open the temple gate.
0:31:11|0:31:24|In the temple, the cobwebs were dense. Curiously, he walked in, his small feet stirring up the dust on the ground. The light shone through the cracks in the roof, illuminating the smoke in the air. The colorful statues in the temple were fierce and lifelike.
0:31:24|0:31:34|Looking at the ground, it seems like staring at the suddenly intruding [Jiang Liuer]. [Jiang Liuer] looks up at the statue above with awe, accidentally knocking over the candlestick on the ground.
0:31:34|0:31:42|He picked up the candlestick and walked towards the offering table in front of him. On the table was a Maitreya Buddha with one hand making a gesture of respect. [Jiang Liuer] placed the candlestick next to the Buddha statue.
0:31:42|0:31:54|Seeing that the offering table was covered in dust, [Sun Wukong] blew on it, causing dust to fly everywhere. Suddenly, the Buddha statue showed signs of movement, and Maitreya Buddha burst out of the door.
0:32:2|0:32:9|Maitreya Buddha's eyes rolled around, and he decided to fight fire with fire, chanting a spell to engage [Sun Wukong].
0:32:14|0:32:21|After Maitreya Buddha finished chanting the mantra, there was no movement. Suddenly, the eyeballs of the fish he was roasting jumped out, and the little girl popped out.
0:32:21|0:32:29|Maitreya Buddha was so scared that he fell down, and the little girl dropped on him and laughed even more joyfully. [Jiang Liuer] approached, only to find Maitreya Buddha.
0:32:29|0:32:40|He turned into a pig's nose, then pig ears popped out of his head, completely transforming into a pig demon wearing a little vest. When he saw the grilled fish, he immediately pounced on it and devoured it ravenously.
0:33:5|0:33:14|Sun Wukong looked at Marshal Tianpeng [Zhu Bajie] with a disdainful expression. [Zhu Bajie] jumped in place, slapped his knees vigorously, landed and struck a pose, then said,
0:33:16|0:33:31|Just as he approached Sun Wukong, his nostrils were pinched by Sun Wukong's two fingers. Sun Wukong hooked his nose and swung half a circle towards the big tree. Zhu Bajie's memory was instantly awakened, and history always has astonishing similarities.
0:33:31|0:33:40|Back then, he transformed into Li Tianwang and was struck down to the mortal world by Sun Wukong, falling into a pigsty in the mountain village, turning into a little piglet, allowing the big pig to nudge him around.
0:33:57|0:34:12|Sun Wukong looked at the snot on his hand, [Zhu Bajie] covered his nose in horror. Seeing Sun Wukong leaving, he looked back a few times, [Zhu Bajie] shouted loudly, while [Jiang Liuer] stared at him with wide eyes. The scene was awkward for a moment.
0:35:4|0:35:15|The pointed-eared, round-faced fat cat is running in the woods, with [Jiang Liuer] panting behind it carrying a little girl on her back. Despite its chubby appearance, the fat cat runs in a way that makes it difficult for [Jiang Liuer] to catch up.
0:35:15|0:35:24|It occasionally glanced back at [Jiang Liuer], suddenly made a sharp turn at the edge of a bush, the fat cat panting with its tongue out from exhaustion, but quickly resumed its sniffing state.
0:35:24|0:35:34|It ran a few steps, lifted its leg to urinate by a tree root, but saw Sun Wukong's back ahead, the fat cat quickly dodged, and the urine splashed on [Jiang Liuer]'s feet.
0:35:34|0:35:41|The fat cat tried to slip away, but was pulled back by [Jiang Liuer].
0:35:46|0:35:51|[Jiang Liuer] is holding a tree branch in her hand.
0:36:26|0:36:32|Sun Wukong couldn't bear to look at the strange-eyed Jiang Liuer who appeared out of thin air, covering his eyes and shaking his head.
0:36:32|0:36:38|[Jiang Liuer] poked the big belly of this new companion.
0:36:39|0:36:47|Jiang Liuer, with a big belly, transformed into Zhu Bajie with a breath, and was bounced away by him, rolling all the way to the edge of a cliff.
0:36:49|0:36:55|He suddenly sensed something was wrong, looked back in fear, and saw a white dragon hovering in the air, staring at him.
0:36:58|0:37:11|The dragon perched on the mountaintop, with a horse head, deer antlers, fish scales, and snake body. Sun Wukong saw the dragon diving towards Jiang Liuer, he pounced fiercely, pushed the dragon's head, and the white dragon was knocked over several times.
0:37:12|0:37:20|The white dragon slowly raised its body, circled around [Sun Wukong], and then looked down on [Sun Wukong] with unparalleled dominance.
0:37:20|0:37:28|[Jiang Liuer] and [Zhu Bajie] ran over, [Sun Wukong] hurriedly stopped them, the White Dragon stared at [Sun Wukong], suddenly a dragon roar sounded,
0:37:28|0:37:34|A squid leg slapped [Sun Wukong]'s face, a starfish stuck to [Zhu Bajie]'s head. The white dragon turned its head towards [Jiang Liuer],
0:37:37|0:37:49|Helping [Zhu Bajie] pull the starfish, [Jiang Liuer] stood still immediately. The white dragon's huge claws shattered the ground, sending rocks flying everywhere. It stared at [Sun Wukong] for a moment, then suddenly turned around and flew towards the valley.
0:37:57|0:38:7|[Jiang Liuer] fearfully covered her face with her arms, tears streaming down. Upon seeing this, [Sun Wukong] immediately turned to [Zhu Bajie].
0:38:25|0:38:32|In the midst of speaking, the White Dragon rushed out of the valley, circled in the air for a moment, and then flew out of the valley like a fish swimming in water.
0:38:38|0:38:42|[Sun Wukong] left [Zhu Bajie] and followed [Jiang Liuer].
0:38:42|0:38:50|[Zhu Bajie] sat there with a disdainful look on his face, while [Jiang Liuer] climbed up the hill by the sea with a little girl on her back, looking into the distance.
0:41:5|0:41:9|[Fa Ming] faced the setting sun, dragging the crocodile that was tightly biting onto him, moving forward with difficulty.
0:41:9|0:41:26|[Sun Wukong] and the group walked out of the woods, [Jiang Liuer] marching forward. Suddenly, she spotted a house ahead and ran towards it. [Zhu Bajie] was excited for food and followed along. [Sun Wukong] stood still, quietly turned back the way they came, and took a bite of the peach in his hand.
0:41:46|0:41:53|The [Boss Lady] with a fairy bun hairstyle lifted the kitchen door curtain and walked towards the front door. She smoothed her hair and adjusted her chest before heading out.
0:42:6|0:42:12|[Zhu Bajie] rushed into the kitchen in a hurry, and the waiter quickly plunged into the water tank. [Zhu Bajie] lifted his butt and sat right on the tank opening.
0:42:16|0:42:37|[Sun Wukong] jumped onto the door panel, pressing down [Boss Lady] who was about to speak. He then leaped onto the table, took the teapot, and jumped onto the railing on the second floor. With a swift move, he caught the teapot lid just as it was about to fall. [Zhu Bajie] walked out of the kitchen looking content, then hurried over to the chili peppers hanging on the wall. In the kitchen's water tank, the waiter emerged with a lump of feces on his head.
0:42:37|0:42:44|[Jiang Liuer] heard the voice and asked, the shopkeeper lifted the door curtain and walked out, [Jiang Liuer] asked,
0:43:22|0:43:30|[Sun Wukong] jumps down from upstairs and stands in front of [Boss Lady], while [Zhu Bajie] on the side rolls on the ground in pain from eating chili peppers, licking the floor tiles.
0:43:54|0:44:4|[Zhu Bajie] stared at [Boss Lady], his eyes wide open. [Sun Wukong] deliberately threw the teapot to [Zhu Bajie].
0:44:8|0:44:10|[Sun Wukong] steps on [Zhu Bajie]'s back and jumps to the second floor.
0:44:10|0:44:22|When [Jiang Liuer] walked away, [Boss Lady] looked at the little girl maliciously, but suddenly [Sun Wukong] blocked her view.
0:44:22|0:44:32|[Boss Lady] exited the guest room. Upon seeing her, [Zhu Bajie] quickly sucked in his belly and made way. [Boss Lady] climbed down the ladder and accidentally bumped into the waiter.
0:44:39|0:44:45|[Zhu Bajie] made all kinds of funny faces at the little girl, but she kept crying uncontrollably. [Zhu Bajie] furrowed his brow.
0:44:45|0:44:54|Stretched out his tongue to lick his own nostrils, but was pulled away by [Sun Wukong]. [Jiang Liuer] took out a puppet.
0:44:59|0:45:16|The little girl entered dreamland with a smile, [Zhu Bajie] and [Jiang Liuer] both yawning, while [Sun Wukong] nibbled on a peach and leaped onto the window of the room. One eye peeked through the hole in the wooden door to spy inside the room, a fly flew in, and [Sun Wukong] threw a clay pot hitting it, also hitting the shop assistant peeking outside.
0:45:23|0:45:33|The shopkeeper was hanging upside down on the railing on the second floor, and [Boss Lady] looked very disdainful. [Boss Lady] walked into the courtyard, tiptoed to the door of another wooden house, which stood tall.
0:45:33|0:45:39|On the roof, there is a thick pile of hay. In the guest room, [Sun Wukong] leans against the window with his hands behind his head, lost in thought.
0:45:39|0:45:46|In bed, [Jiang Liuer] turned over, opened her eyes, and saw [Sun Wukong] shaking his leg boredly by the window.
0:46:28|0:46:36|[Jiang Liuer] sat dejectedly on the edge of the bed.
0:46:38|0:46:42|[Zhu Bajie] immediately felt greedy and licked his lips eagerly.
0:46:53|0:47:2|[Sun Wukong] was speaking when he raised his hand and saw the seal on his wrist, instantly quieting down.
0:47:28|0:47:37|[Jiang Liuer] on the bed has fallen asleep soundly. He gently averted his gaze, then looked back at his dharma seal, feeling helpless as he gazed up at the sky.
0:47:41|0:47:47|The door of the guest room quietly opens and closes again, with [Sun Wukong] at the window, arms crossed and head down.
0:47:47|0:47:57|Seems to have fallen into a deep sleep. [Zhu Bajie] crawled out of the room, quickly wriggled to the stairs, and as his pig hoof stepped on the ladder, it broke the rung.
0:47:58|0:48:3|Sitting on the ground, perking up his ears, looking around, and then happily running off.
0:48:3|0:48:9|Unexpectedly, the shopkeeper stood in the dark with a pitchfork. [Zhu Bajie] squeezed into the kitchen, sniffing around with his nose.
0:48:9|0:48:20|He came to the bottles and jars placed against the wall, opened the lids one by one to check, and finally found some chestnuts in the jar in the middle.
0:48:20|0:48:24|He stuck out his tongue, trying to grab the chestnuts, but got stuck in the bottle neck.
0:48:24|0:48:38|The waiter raised his rake behind him, [Zhu Bajie] suddenly saw [Boss Lady] passing by the window, in a hurry he pulled out his tongue and knocked the waiter unconscious on the ground. [Boss Lady] pushed open the door, and there was no one in the kitchen.
0:48:38|0:48:46|She walked quickly into the room, and behind the door, [Zhu Bajie] was ready to slip away. The [Boss Lady] suddenly turned around, but [Zhu Bajie] had already transformed into a waiter.
0:48:48|0:48:55|[Boss Lady] closed the door, and the real shop assistant fell down. [Boss Lady] looked suspiciously at [Zhu Bajie].
0:49:0|0:49:9|[Boss Lady] walked towards the hall, [Zhu Bajie] tried to slip away. [Zhu Bajie] quickly stood in front of the waiter, perfectly imitating his tongue-sticking-out gesture.
0:49:12|0:49:18|[Boss Lady] tried to take away [Zhu Bajie], but ended up grabbing the hand of the waiter and dragging him forward without looking back.
0:49:18|0:49:23|[Zhu Bajie] wanted to slip away, but turned back and followed along. He kicked the waiter away and sat down next to [Boss Lady].
0:49:45|0:49:52|[Zhu Bajie] walked towards the door covering his mouth, but as soon as he lifted the curtain, he was pulled back by [Boss Lady].
0:49:55|0:50:2|[Zhu Bajie] tried to shake off [Boss Lady] and leave, but she pulled him back.
0:50:2|0:50:10|[Boss Lady] held [Zhu Bajie]'s face, and that human face turned into a pig face.
0:50:11|0:50:32|Outside the door, a monkey's foot flew in, kicking [Boss Lady] out of the inn's door. [Sun Wukong] was about to step forward, but found the ground covered in moonlight. Looking up, he saw the roof had been lifted, with [Hundun] standing on the central wooden pole of the inn, a huge vortex engulfing the sky.
0:50:32|0:50:39|Around the inn, multiple formations appeared, and dozens of mountain demons were transported over, heading towards [Sun Wukong]. [Jiang Liuer] stepped out of the guest room.
0:50:41|0:50:48|[Jiang Liuer] quickly returned to her room and closed the door. The mountain demon rushing towards her was knocked unconscious by [Sun Wukong] with a kick on the stairs.
0:50:48|0:50:56|[Sun Wukong] swings and throws a mountain demon, [Zhu Bajie] sees the demon flying towards him, immediately transforms into a fly. Just as he narrowly escapes one disaster, he is then swallowed by the demon.
0:50:58|0:51:8|The mountain demon burped, spitting out flies, and the flies buzzed and turned into [Zhu Bajie], knocking over the wooden table. The bruised [Boss Lady] sneaked into the room and hid behind a pillar.
0:51:8|0:51:19|Observing in secret. Taking advantage of the intense battle in the hall, she quietly climbed upstairs and was about to move towards the guest room when two mountain demons that had been knocked flying pierced through the second-floor floor and got stuck under her feet. Inside the guest room,
0:51:19|0:51:26|[Jiang Liuer] leaned against the door, breathing heavily, while the little girl lay on a bamboo mat, holding a doll of [Sun Wukong] and sound asleep.
0:51:26|0:51:46|[Boss Lady] with a murderous look in her eyes lunged forward, [Jiang Liuer] held the little girl and hid under the table, kicking and struggling against [Boss Lady]. [Boss Lady] lifted the table, and [Jiang Liuer] smashed the table leg onto her foot. Upon hearing the screams, [Sun Wukong] immediately shook off the mountain demon and leaped to the second floor.
0:51:46|0:51:49|Another mountain demon pounced on him, only to be struck against the wall by him.
0:51:49|0:52:0|[Sun Wukong] leaped in the hall, grabbed a pillar and swung it around, kicking away the mountain demon that pounced on him, sending it crashing into a pile of mountain demons in the corner like a bowling ball. [Sun Wukong] then jumped up to the second floor.
0:52:0|0:52:13|Being knocked down by the mountain demon again, he shouted towards [Zhu Bajie], [Sun Wukong] smashed the mountain demon on him, [Zhu Bajie] spun and flew towards the second floor, but got stuck on the railing, a mountain demon pounced on his buttocks.
0:52:14|0:52:25|In the guest room, [Jiang Liuer] took advantage of [Boss Lady] lifting the table and quickly carried the little girl out from between her legs. Just as [Boss Lady] chased out the door, she was knocked over by [Zhu Bajie] sliding over, crashing through the outer wall and flying out of the inn.
0:52:26|0:52:31|[Sun Wukong] was pinned to the corner by the mountain demon, and the surrounding mountain demons swarmed in.
0:52:34|0:52:44|[Jiang Liuer] is worried about [Sun Wukong], but two mountain monsters climb up in front of him. He runs with the little girl to the hole in the wall smashed by [Boss Lady]. [Zhu Bajie] sees the mountain monsters climbing up behind him.
0:52:44|0:52:54|Rushing towards the wall opening in a panic, [Jiang Liuer] was also knocked out. The group fell onto the roof and were bounced off, coincidentally knocking down [Boss Lady] who had just stood up to assert her authority.
0:52:54|0:53:1|[Zhu Bajie] couldn't get up and could only roll away. In the inn, [Sun Wukong] was still being pressed to the ground by a group of mountain demons.
0:53:1|0:53:7|With a roar, he blew up all the mountain demons on his body, causing the entire inn to collapse with a bang.
0:53:8|0:53:13|[Sun Wukong] leaped onto the back of the mountain demon, easily jumped a few times, and escaped from the inn.
0:53:15|0:53:18|[Hundun] stood on a wooden pole, looking down at [Sun Wukong].
0:53:18|0:53:40|He appeared to be a delicate-looking young man with a double-winged black gauze hat on his head. Gathering a ball of light between his hands, he suddenly rushed towards the ground, blasting the surrounding dust away. [Sun Wukong] roared as he jumped onto the old wooden boat moored by the shore, pulled down the sail in a second, and the dust from the ruins suddenly spread outwards. A mutated mountain demon burst out of the ground.
0:53:40|0:54:2|[Sun Wukong] scanned the boat, grabbed the bamboo pole used to prop up the boat, jumped onto the sail, waved the pole in his right hand, leaped into the air, and gradually lit up with a spell. [Sun Wukong] shouted in pain as he smashed a pole towards the mountain demon pouncing towards him. The low growl of the mountain demon crossed over him, blocking [Zhu Bajie] and [Jiang Liuer]. These mountain demons were all jet black, but their backs were glowing like flowing magma.
0:54:2|0:54:22|[Sun Wukong] swung a bamboo pole to knock the mountain demons flying, then inserted the pole into the ground, leaped into the air, and performed a spinning flying kick. He danced with the bamboo pole in the air, and with a swing of the spinning pole, knocked over a pile of mountain demons. One demon was knocked flying to the side of a wooden boat, [Zhu Bajie] performed a Taishan pressing down from above, and the demon shattered into small pieces like charcoal.
0:54:22|0:54:27|[Jiang Liuer] saw the mountain demon approaching the boat, so she handed the little girl to [Zhu Bajie].
0:54:28|0:54:34|He lifted the gangplank onto the boat, just in time to block the mountain demon that was lunging towards him.
0:54:34|0:54:43|[Sun Wukong] pushed away a group of mountain demons with a bamboo pole, stepped on the pole, bounced out, then reached out to catch the pole bouncing back, and smashed the mountain demons on the boat with one strike.
0:54:43|0:54:48|He paused for a moment, then turned and threw a bamboo pole, which pierced through the mountain demon attacking [Jiang Liuer].
0:54:51|0:54:59|[Jiang Liuer] grabbed [Sun Wukong]'s arm nervously as the seal on his body burst into flames. The wooden boat drifted away from the riverbank, with mountain demons gathering on the shore.
0:55:0|0:55:8|In the valley not far away, as the rosy clouds illuminated the sky, [Sun Wukong] sensed something amiss. He turned around and saw a glowing sphere flying straight towards them.
0:55:8|0:55:19|After a huge explosion, a pair of feet resembling eagle claws slowly landed on the boat. He kicked [Zhu Bajie] away and used his magic power to gently catch the little girl.
0:55:21|0:55:27|[Hundun] held the little girl with one hand, reached out to take the [Sun Wukong] doll from her hand, and glanced at it.
0:55:34|0:55:41|Hundun suddenly looked down, Jiang Liuer clung to his clothes tightly, and was then bounced by the air current onto a pillar.
0:55:44|0:55:55|[Hundun] raised his palm towards [Jiang Liuer], [Sun Wukong] quickly grabbed a bamboo pole and struck at him. The two clashed with their powers, [Sun Wukong] was thrown into a pile of debris after just a few seconds of resistance, [Hundun]
0:55:55|0:56:3|One foot stepped on [Sun Wukong]'s head.
0:56:3|0:56:14|[Hundun] pushed [Sun Wukong] into the deck, and as they ascended, he casually dropped a fireball, engulfing the entire wooden ship in flames. [Hundun] grabbed the little girl and landed back on the shore.
0:56:14|0:56:21|With a flick of his sleeve, the mountain demon beside him turned into ashes, and he laughed wildly as he spun away.
0:56:21|0:56:39|On the shore, [Zhu Bajie] lay flat on the ground, continuously spitting out water. [Jiang Liuer] also lay on a rock, coughing lightly. [Sun Wukong], who was lying near the jungle, moved his fingers, struggled to support his waist with both hands on the ground, and then stood up unsteadily.
0:56:39|0:56:47|He glanced back at [Jiang Liuer] silently, then lowered his head and walked towards the jungle, with [Jiang Liuer] quickly catching up.
0:57:4|0:57:10|[Sun Wukong] saw [Jiang Liuer] standing aside and lowered his fist that was about to punch [Zhu Bajie].
0:57:14|0:57:20|[Sun Wukong] turned his head to the side, closed his eyes, and [Jiang Liuer] shook her head in disbelief and stepped back.
0:57:29|0:57:47|[Jiang Liuer] ran into the jungle with tears in his eyes. He ran with his head down, tripped by a stone and fell far away, then got up and continued crying. He ran all the way to the river, shivering as he waded through the small river.
0:57:47|0:57:57|[Jiang Liuer] leaned against the giant rock on the river bank, slumping down on the stone. His small hands were red from the cold, and the two patches of highland red on his cheeks had deepened.
0:57:57|0:58:4|The fragmented golden sunlight filtered through the leaves as [Jiang Liuer] rubbed her eyes with her small hands, sighing wearily.
0:58:5|0:58:10|He stood up, propped up his knees, leaned against the giant rock, and was about to leave.
0:58:10|0:58:17|Two mountain demons crawled over, and [Jiang Liuer] cowered in fear behind a giant rock.
0:58:19|0:58:28|Upon hearing the news, [Jiang Liuer] thought for a moment, gritted her teeth, and followed along.
0:58:33|0:58:53|On the edge of the jungle, [Sun Wukong] angrily smashed the seal on the rock with his right hand, accidentally injuring [Zhu Bajie] who was standing nearby. Suddenly, [Zhu Bajie] floated into the air, while chunks of rocks floated around [Sun Wukong]'s right hand. The light on his hand exploded instantly, and [Sun Wukong] collapsed as if he had exhausted all his strength, his body floating in the shallow pool.
0:58:53|0:59:3|In the quiet jungle, [Jiang Liuer] took small steps cautiously, stopping from time to time. He carefully pushed aside the leaves on both sides, when suddenly a tree trunk carrying a mountain demon swept over his head.
0:59:3|0:59:13|[Jiang Liuer] was so scared that her features went out of control. She quickly looked in the direction where the bucket was flying towards the tree. A vine dropped from the cliff and extended all the way to the distant clouds.
0:59:28|0:59:49|[Sun Wukong] opens his eyes in the water, watching [Jiang Liuer] holding a puppet gradually disappear in front of him. Only the puppet remains floating in the water as [Sun Wukong] pushes away the small fish around it, deeply immersed in memories.
1:0:18|1:0:39|[Sun Wukong] recalled the scene of causing havoc in the Heavenly Palace years ago. He passed through ten thousand arrows and turned into a ball of fire. Standing on the peak of the cloud, he confronted a hundred thousand heavenly soldiers. His bright and dazzling cloak was swept up by the wind and snow in the sky.
1:0:39|1:0:52|[Sun Wukong] suddenly emerged from the water, breaking free from his memories. He lay gasping for breath on the shallow bank, glanced at the puppet in his hand, and clenched it tightly.
1:0:54|1:1:2|[Zhu Bajie] eyes lit up and nodded vigorously.
1:1:35|1:1:52|In the cave, the mountain demons all howled for [Hundun], but one of them discovered a small tree stump with a ghost face sneaking into a small cave in the rock wall. He hurried to catch up, only to find three stone caves in front of him.
1:1:52|1:2:0|[Jiang Liuer] is on a stalactite above his head, slipping and almost falling down. The mountain demon looks at the cave and raises its claw.
1:2:8|1:2:16|The mountain demon, hit by the stalactite broken by [Jiang Liuer], suddenly woke up and happily ran into the cave pointed by the stalactite.
1:2:17|1:2:21|[Jiang Liuer] falls from the rock and gets stuck in the hanging wooden board.
1:2:21|1:2:29|The female mountain demon dragged the mountain demon who had just left back to [Jiang Liuer], only to be punched in return.
1:2:36|1:2:52|The female mountain demon suddenly took a hit, half of her sharp teeth fell out. [Fa Ming] wielded the flower staff with one hand and flung the staff, knocking out the female mountain demon who then dragged the mountain demon next to her and fell into the cave entrance, plunging into Hundun's iron furnace.
1:3:5|1:3:13|[Fa Ming] tried to pull [Jiang Liuer] out, but they both fell down.
1:3:13|1:3:22|[Jiang Liuer] grabs the spherical wooden cage hanging in mid-air.
1:3:24|1:3:39|The spherical wooden cage, resembling a large pendulum, is hanging from ropes, knocking over the mountain demons watching around the cave. [Hundun] is extremely displeased, and the mountain demons behind [Hundun] panic and jump down from the stone platform.
1:3:39|1:3:50|The glowing iron furnace smashed down, and [Hundun] hurriedly used his hands to block it. Just as he let go, a wooden cage flew towards him, hitting the stone platform hard. [Hundun] propped himself up, gritting his teeth in anger.
1:3:50|1:3:55|The iron furnace and wooden cage rolled out of the cave along the stone platform one after another.
1:3:58|1:4:19|The wooden cage flew out of the demon cave and was blocked by a bird-shaped fence on a circular altar protruding from the cliff. The iron furnace was also stuck at the entrance of the wooden bridge leading to the altar, which stood lonely in the middle of the vast sea of clouds. Three sides of the cliff were surrounded by mountains, with temples hanging on the cliff walls. A pale-faced [Jiang Liuer] rushed towards her master.
1:4:21|1:4:40|The little girl looked up at the sky, a black disc slowly approaching the sun, casting a shadow over the cliff, and mountain demons gathering on the peak. [Hundun] pinched the mouth of the mountain demon.
1:4:41|1:4:48|[Hundun] uses his magical powers to teleport and charges towards [Jiang Liuer].
1:5:4|1:5:12|[Jiang Liuer] was choked until his eyes rolled back, struggling to breathe. He watched the hawk soaring in the sky and gradually closed his eyes.
1:5:12|1:5:26|At the bottom of the cliff, a vortex appeared in the white mist, and a white dragon suddenly rushed up. It knocked over [Hundun], took away [Jiang Liuer], and when [Hundun] took a closer look, there were still two people sitting on the white dragon.
1:5:26|1:5:33|The white dragon danced in the air, turned around, and dove straight down towards [Hundun].
1:5:33|1:5:40|A white dragon swiftly darted into the demon cave on the cliff, and a dragon eye appeared in the mist.
1:5:43|1:5:47|The White Dragon bit the shocked female mountain demon under its feet and flung her into the sky.
1:5:48|1:6:1|Flying up into the air again, he grabbed her in his mouth, swaying his tail as he drilled into the clouds. [Jiang Liuer] lay on the ground, struggling to lift her head. A dense smoke emerged from the cave entrance, with a human-shaped black shadow.
1:6:2|1:6:8|Quietly appearing, [Sun Wukong] emerges from the smoke and squints at the altar.
1:6:10|1:6:24|A group of mountain demons crowded behind the rocks watching, [Hundun] stood up and cursed,
1:6:32|1:6:45|[Zhu Bajie] held a rake, his body swelling piece by piece, his figure multiplied several times. He swung the rake towards [Hundun], but unexpectedly got hit by Hundun's magic ball, instantly transforming into a little piglet.
1:6:45|1:6:56|Rolling all the way to the feet of [Jiang Liuer]. [Zhu Bajie] saw his pig hooves shrink and was immediately confused. [Sun Wukong] hid the stone behind him, jumped tens of feet high in an instant, threw the stone, and knocked away [Hundun]'s magic ball.
1:6:56|1:7:2|A group of mountain demons were knocked off a cliff by a magic ball. [Sun Wukong] flew up and threw a punch, which was blocked by [Hundun] with one hand.
1:7:2|1:7:8|[Hundun] grabbed him, spun him around, and kicked him into the monster cave, smashing through several walls in a row.
1:7:11|1:7:18|[Hundun] rushed towards the altar, but was pushed aside by flying rocks, his black gauze hat blown off, his hair scattered.
1:7:20|1:7:32|[Sun Wukong] flew up and kicked out two huge rocks, [Hundun] lifted his foot to kick one piece, leaned back to dodge another, shook off the flying mountain demon, soared into the sky, and reached out to grab [Sun Wukong], who was hit head-on by [Hundun].
1:7:32|1:7:41|Before he could react, [Hundun] appeared behind him and kicked him off the roof. [Hundun] then flew ahead and kicked [Sun Wukong] back to the ground.
1:7:41|1:7:48|[Hundun] gathered energy and unleashed a fireball, which hit [Sun Wukong] directly, causing a mushroom cloud to rise from the altar.
1:7:52|1:8:11|[Hundun] fell heavily back to the ground, gasping as he stood up, looking at the motionless [Sun Wukong] lying flat on the ground. He took a step towards him, and suddenly his ankle was grabbed by [Sun Wukong].
1:8:18|1:8:29|[Sun Wukong] was shining all over, and with one punch, he sent [Hundun] flying into the sky. The mountain demon who was watching the excitement also cheered, and [Hundun], looking around at the little demons, resentfully threw out a magic ball.
1:8:29|1:8:40|[Sun Wukong] withstood the attack of the magic ball, using all four limbs, running at the speed of light to dodge [Hundun]'s magical pursuit. [Hundun] released light blades resembling boomerangs, [Sun Wukong] somersaulted continuously to evade the attack, then leaped into the air.
1:8:40|1:8:45|Jumping onto the temple in mid-air. He ran and dodged on the eaves, then rushed towards [Hundun] facing the light blade.
1:8:46|1:8:57|[Hundun] brought a huge rock to block the way, but it was shattered by [Sun Wukong] with a palm strike. [Hundun] tumbled several times, and before he could steady himself, he was pushed off the cliff by [Sun Wukong]. The two fought on the wooden platform under the bridge.
1:8:57|1:9:1|[Sun Wukong] was thrown to the bridge by [Hundun], then bounced back by pulling the rope.
1:9:4|1:9:13|[Hundun] releases a tracking spell ball, [Sun Wukong] spins and jumps in the middle of the wooden frame, avoiding the crazy impacts of the spell ball. [Sun Wukong] then punches [Hundun] in the face.
1:9:14|1:9:26|The iron furnace on the bridge was about to collapse, [Sun Wukong] immediately rushed towards [Hundun]. The two of them collided and broke the wooden frame of the bridge tower. [Hundun] threw a magic ball which was hit away by [Sun Wukong], and the magic ball hit the wooden frame next to the iron furnace.
1:9:26|1:9:36|The iron furnace rolled down the bridge platform layer by layer, and the two fought in the flying debris. [Hundun] seemed to have exhausted his strength, and [Sun Wukong] quickly embraced him from behind.
1:9:37|1:9:55|Hundun's body gradually swelled, his face turned from white to black, his mouth tore open, revealing sharp teeth, and the iron furnace came crashing down. Below the altar, the wooden bridge half hidden in thick fog creaked, and Hundun roared as he fell into the deep valley. Sun Wukong climbed up the broken end of the wooden board with his hands.
1:10:5|1:10:14|[Jiang Liuer] joyfully catches the puppet thrown by [Sun Wukong], just as the sun is blocked by a black disc, and a total solar eclipse occurs.
1:10:14|1:10:25|The wooden bridge seemed to be violently shaken, and Zhu Bajie was knocked against the railing. A muffled thunder sounded from the abyss, causing great fear among the mountain demons.
1:10:25|1:10:41|The wooden bridge suddenly stopped swaying, and [Jiang Liuer] who was holding onto the cage stood up and ran to the edge of the bridge. Looking down, a four-fingered giant claw reached out from the abyss's white mist and slapped the stone pillar supporting the altar. A monster with a huge bloody mouth stood up in the white mist.
1:10:41|1:10:50|The monster, which looks like a giant flesh worm, climbed up the altar along the wooden frame, causing [Jiang Liuer] standing at the cliff edge to widen her eyes in fear.
1:11:1|1:11:9|The monster has no ears, eyes, or nose, with a body full of wrinkles and six legs, this is the true form of the ancient fierce beast [Hundun].
1:11:9|1:11:21|[Hundun] pressed against the cliff, crawling towards [Jiang Liuer] and the others. He opened his huge mouth, howled to the sky, and pounced on the wooden cage containing young boys and girls. [Jiang Liuer] quickly dodged, leaving the empty wooden cage behind.
1:11:21|1:11:31|Rolled down into the deep valley. As the dust settled, the little girl clung to [Jiang Liuer]'s clothes, hanging on to him. [Fa Ming] and the children were right beside them, standing on a protrusion on the cliff.
1:11:31|1:11:38|Hundun climbed up and approached Jiang Liuer, only to be hit on the head by a falling rock as they stood on the edge of a cliff.
1:11:38|1:11:45|[Sun Wukong] leaped and broke the hard stones sticking out of the cliff, which fell onto [Hundun] and sent it sliding down to the bottom of the valley.
1:11:45|1:11:53|[Hundun] shot out a beam of light from his mouth, hitting [Sun Wukong], causing him to fall from the sky as if he had lost his soul.
1:11:53|1:11:59|[Hundun] lifted his huge claw and slammed [Sun Wukong] into the cliff, while [Jiang Liuer] and [Fa Ming] took the child and temporarily hid on the plank road.
1:11:59|1:12:7|Hundun lifted a large rock and blocked the entrance where Sun Wukong was, Jiang Liuer ran to the edge of the plank with a little girl in her arms, then anxiously turned back.
1:12:18|1:12:21|[Jiang Liuer] smiled and agreed, then ran towards [Hundun].
1:12:23|1:12:34|He climbed up to the cave entrance along the cracks in the rocks, [Hundun] was still in place, using his claws to push the boulder into the cave, [Jiang Liuer] climbed up to the entrance, [Sun Wukong] was being pressed against the stone wall by the boulder.
1:13:0|1:13:14|[Jiang Liuer] pulled out a wooden stick from the pile of rocks, the stick flew out and got stuck between the two sharp teeth of [Hundun]. [Jiang Liuer] stood still, stunned, and sniffed her nose.
1:13:14|1:13:22|[Hundun] raised its huge claw, [Jiang Liuer] dodged Hundun's heavy blow, but was swept under the bridge by the powerful airflow.
1:13:22|1:13:39|He stood up and shouted at the roaring [Hundun]. After shouting at [Jiang Liuer], he turned and ran, successfully provoking [Hundun]. [Hundun] fiercely slammed his two front paws towards him, only to hit the rocks behind him.
1:13:39|1:13:48|[Hundun] roared and lunged towards [Jiang Liuer]. Inside the stone cave, [Sun Wukong] exerted all his strength to push open the solid rock.
1:13:48|1:13:54|The solid rock was blasted open by his brute force, and the light burst from the seal on his right hand.
1:13:54|1:14:5|[Jiang Liuer] jumped down the broken stone layer and stood firm. In front of her was a narrow stone bridge. [Hundun] broke through the stone wall behind him, and [Jiang Liuer] quickly ran onto the stone bridge.
1:14:5|1:14:14|His palm broke half of the bridge, luckily [Jiang Liuer] had already run to the other side, and [Hundun] opened his mouth and pounced towards [Jiang Liuer].
1:14:25|1:14:31|[Sun Wukong] broke through the clouds and jumped onto [Hundun]'s back.
1:14:34|1:14:42|[Jiang Liuer] fearfully covered her head, then peeked at [Hundun] with one eye. [Sun Wukong] jumped down from Hundun's head, and [Jiang Liuer] raised her hands high to greet him.
