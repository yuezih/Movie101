0:2:2|0:2:5|The large gem in the middle sparkled brightly.
0:2:5|0:2:13|The middle gem, the diamonds on both sides, and the pendant below were divided into three parts, followed by the appearance of the film title.
0:2:13|0:2:16|The following is a description of the main feature.
0:2:16|0:2:25|The mastermind of the theft case, [Zhang Dan], was released after serving 5 years in prison, in a desolate countryside. The French FrÃªnes Prison is located here.
0:2:25|0:2:37|A black-clad prison guard opens a drawer expressionlessly, inside are cigarettes, a wallet, a cellphone, and a Guanyin pendant. The glass reflects the figure of [Zhang Dan], who silently takes the items away.
0:2:37|0:2:44|The prison guard pressed a button, and the prison gate slowly opened, allowing sunlight to instantly shine into the dark prison.
0:2:44|0:2:52|Detective [Pierre] stood straight outside the prison gate, while [Zhang Dan] walked out and put the pendant around her neck.
0:2:52|0:2:54|[Pierre] stepped forward and said, "You seem to be in good shape."
0:3:6|0:3:28|[Pierre] joked: [Zhang Dan] let out a sigh and said, [Zhang Dan] nodded in agreement, but then looked up provocatively and said, before patting the displeased [Pierre] on the face and leaving straight away.
0:3:30|0:3:42|Pierre then took out the walkie-talkie from the car and said, staring straight at Zhang Dan's back. Zhang Dan hid himself with the hat on his clothes and walked gracefully on the road in the field.
0:3:43|0:4:6|Next to a gas station, a car followed [Zhang Dan], with an undercover policewoman sitting inside. [Zhang Dan] sat by the window of the convenience store, drinking a beverage and watching the children playing outside. Suddenly, a stranger called, and the policewoman in the car took out a camera and zoomed in to take a picture of [Zhang Dan]. Then a car drove past the window, and [Zhang Dan] disappeared.
0:4:6|0:4:16|The policewoman hesitated for a moment, realizing something was wrong. She immediately put down the camera, got off the car, and saw a helicopter rising up from behind the gas station and flying away.
0:4:16|0:4:39|The female police officer chased after but found it was too late. A cigarette box was thrown down from the plane. The officer's face turned ugly as she stood in place watching the plane leave. A police car stopped next to an antique shop, and [Pierre] got out of the car. Police tape was set up around the antique shop, and an officer was taking photos of the crime scene. [Pierre] walked in and said to the man being held hostage in the room:
0:4:57|0:5:4|He pointed to the necklace on the suspect's neck and said,
0:5:16|0:5:22|[Pierre] looked around skeptically, then picked up an antique cup and handed it to the man, saying,
0:5:32|0:5:55|As soon as the voice fell, on the other side, a helicopter flew across the sky, below was an endless ocean. [Lao Mo] piloted the aircraft, with [Zhang Dan] sitting behind. They flew all the way to Cannes, France. The helicopter landed on the outskirts of the city, [Zhang Dan] opened the cabin door and locked eyes with [Lao Mo]. [Lao Mo] turned his head and gave him a thumbs up. [Zhang Dan] then slowly stood up, holding onto the cabin door, looking down at the sea where groups of...
0:5:55|0:6:4|The ship in the distance looked as small as a sesame seed. [Zhang Dan], wearing a flight suit, stuck her whole body out and seized the opportunity to leap down.
0:6:4|0:6:20|He spread his arms, his body bouncing with the airflow, flying towards the coast, below him was the boundless sea, in the distance were endless mountain peaks, connecting with the sky in a line, [Zhang Dan] glided rapidly against the wind, searching for the destination where he would soon land.
0:6:20|0:6:33|He then opened the parachute behind him, slowing down instantly. He gradually began to descend, choosing a pier surrounded by several fishing boats. He got closer and closer to the ground, and soon landed steadily on the ground.
0:6:36|0:7:1|[Xiao Bao] disguised himself as a foreigner with a headgear and wig, and arrived at the entrance of the luxurious Cannes Grand Hotel. The hotel was magnificent, with service staff bustling around to carry luggage for guests. There were many security guards inside and outside the entrance, along with a security checkpoint. [Xiao Bao] walked straight in, threw his backpack to the security officer, and stood at the security gate waiting for inspection. His disguise successfully fooled the computer and security guards, allowing him to pass through the security check smoothly.
0:7:1|0:7:12|He took the backpack from the security guard, walked through the hotel lobby, and a group of people in uniforms approached. [Xiao Bao] glanced at them, then turned and walked into a small door that was not easy to spot after they had walked away.
0:7:17|0:7:25|At this moment, [Zhang Dan] still had his gear on as he ran towards the lighthouse not far away, while [Xiao Bao] walked through the dim corridor to the innermost part.
0:7:25|0:7:42|He took out a computer from his bag and placed it on a table, then plugged in a network cable from the wall. Meanwhile, [Zhang Dan] rode a motorcycle out from the lighthouse and changed into a sharp suit. He raced along the coastal road, determination shining through his helmet.
0:7:42|0:7:56|At this moment, [Xiao Bao] was leisurely peeking at the hotel's internal network information. He skillfully found the list of hotel inspectors, and Zhang Dan's photo suddenly appeared on it. Unable to resist, Xiao Bao teased Zhang Dan.
0:8:3|0:8:7|[Xiao Bao] chuckled and pressed the delete key, erasing all of [Zhang Dan]'s information.
0:8:7|0:8:30|[Zhang Dan] rode his motorcycle into the city, overtaking all the cars. [Xiao Bao] was also packing up to leave. At that moment, the hotel entrance was covered with a red carpet and surrounded by fences. A group of people held up signs and shouted. Reporters and photographers swarmed in, snapping photos of the people walking on the red carpet. Among them was a woman in a gorgeous gown, wearing a diamond-studded necklace.
0:8:30|0:8:40|Posing for the photographer, [Zhang Dan] walked past from the side, making a fake move to deceive the man in front of her, stealing the invitation letter from his pocket. The voice of [Zhang Dan] echoed in [Xiao Bao]'s ears.
0:8:43|0:9:3|[Xiao Bao] returned: [Zhang Dan] walked into the hotel and pretended to be familiar with the security guard, smiling at him. With a stolen invitation, she successfully deceived the guard. [Xiao Bao] slipped into another room. [Zhang Dan] walked through the crowd and entered the elevator. She said to [Xiao Bao], who raised his arm to look at his watch. In a bar, a group of people cheered and shouted.
0:9:4|0:9:18|In the crowd, [Ye Hong] dressed in a studded leather jacket, with a neat short hair and smoky makeup, she won a wrist wrestling match against a man and said to the people around her: She walked out of the bar, put a mini communicator in her ear, and greeted with a nod.
0:9:31|0:9:37|[Ye Hong] sneered and rolled her eyes.
0:10:16|0:10:22|[Ye Hong] swaggered down the street, chewing on a lollipop. Before long, she hopped into a car and spoke again.
0:10:56|0:11:0|She shouted along with the crowd while observing her surroundings.
0:11:9|0:11:20|The item was sold for two hundred thousand euros. [Zhang Dan] followed the crowd, clapping, and entered the venue. The auctioneer thanked the buyer and had a servant remove a painting from the stage.
0:11:26|0:11:34|Amidst the applause, the spotlight followed [Tingting] as she walked onto the stage slowly. The auctioneer then continued:
0:11:48|0:12:0|[Zhang Dan] took out her phone and took a picture of the Wings of Destiny on stage. The screen displayed: Target locked. Meanwhile, on the other side, [Xiao Bao]'s computer successfully received the information sent by [Zhang Dan]. After putting down her phone,
0:12:6|0:12:22|At this moment, a car stopped at the hotel entrance. [Pierre] got out of the car, [Ye Hong] noticed something unusual, furrowed her brows, took out her phone, and sent a photo of [Pierre] to [Xiao Bao].
0:12:51|0:13:18|He sought help from his accomplice [Lao Mo], who was flying a helicopter at the time. Meanwhile, [Pierre] followed the security guards into the control room. With sharp eyes, he scanned the row of screens in front of him and soon spotted [Zhang Dan] in the hall. Applause thundered in the hall as the bidding price reached six million. The auctioneer's hammer was about to fall, and everyone held their breath as the hammer hit the table with a resounding thud, signaling the successful sale of the necklace.
0:13:33|0:13:48|The applause at the auction house was continuous, and Miss [Tingting] also showed a satisfied smile. [Zhang Dan] said, "With instructions received, [Ye Hong] is ready to go, shouting loudly:"
0:13:54|0:14:6|[Ye Hong]'s words instantly ignited the protest team, and she led everyone to break through the barricades and rush into the hotel crazily. The security guards were completely unprepared for this sudden riot, desperately trying to stop them, but to no avail.
0:14:9|0:14:24|[Ye Hong] once again incited everyone to attack the auction house, and the hotel lobby instantly fell into chaos. At this moment, [Pierre] was still in the control room observing [Zhang Dan]'s every move, muttering to himself: [Zhang Dan] provocatively stared at the camera, smiled, and got up to leave.
0:14:24|0:14:38|The crowd finally noticed the rioting mob, and the head of security quickly instructed his subordinates to transport the auction items back to the vault and lead the guests to the VIP room. The security guards in the venue responded promptly and efficiently arranged for the safe evacuation of the guests.
0:14:44|0:15:2|The protesters had already rushed into the auction venue and were stopped by security guards at the staircase. [Xiao Bao] held a detector in his hand, clearly marking the movement of the Wing of Destiny on it. He took off his suit and began preparing the equipment needed for the theft. The security guards couldn't stop the protesters who were demonstrating in front of a large crowd, and the defense line was eventually broken through.
0:15:2|0:15:13|[Tingting] furrowed her brows, quickly walked away under the protection of a group of security guards, while protesters had taken over the entire venue, and guests scattered to escape.
0:15:13|0:15:28|[Pierre] hurried to the scene, only to see [Zhang Dan] standing in the distance looking at him with a smug smile. [Xiao Bao] followed the detector to search for the location of the Wing of Destiny. [Pierre] showed his police badge to the hotel security, informing them that someone was attempting a robbery.
0:15:34|0:15:37|A security guard couldn't help but ask, but [Pierre] interrupted him without hesitation, instructing him to inform the captain immediately.
0:15:37|0:15:55|At this moment, [Xiao Bao] followed the blinking light on the detector into a cluttered room. He put the detector in his pocket, moved a cabinet aside, revealing a wall. With confidence, he said, "On the other side, the guests have already been placed in the VIP room."
0:15:55|0:16:0|[Zhang Dan] saw [Tingting] through the glass and put on a friendly smile before pushing the door open.
0:16:11|0:16:31|At this moment, [Xiao Bao] took out a high-tech weapon from his bag. He carefully approached the wall, squatted down, and aimed the head of the weapon at the wall. After aiming, he pressed a button on the back. The wall immediately shattered into pieces under tremendous force. Before long, the shattered wall pieces began to fall off, revealing the steel bars underneath.
0:16:31|0:16:38|On the other side, the security team captain arrived late. [Pierre] instructed him to immediately open the safe and informed him that someone was stealing the Wings of Destiny.
0:16:51|0:17:14|[Pierre] stepped forward and stared at him, telling him that this was a waste of time. At this moment, the thick wall was finally chiseled open by [Xiao Bao], who pushed hard and caused large chunks of cement bricks to fall down. Worried about exposure, he reached out to catch them. The head of security compromised, making excuses to dismiss his subordinates. Meanwhile, [Xiao Bao] had already entered the safe deposit room, holding a detector to locate the Wings of Destiny.
0:17:14|0:17:29|He had just found out that the head of the security team outside had already arranged for his men to open the door of the safe. In this way, [Xiao Bao] was only a wall away from the security guards and police, but he was unaware that he was already in danger, as he continued to observe the safe on his own.
0:17:30|0:17:36|At this moment, the door of the safe vault rattled, and the [security guard] was unlocking it outside, only then did [Xiao Bao] react.
0:17:37|0:17:43|He quickly took out the lock-picking tool and inserted it into the lock of the safe, with a progress bar displayed on the screen.
0:17:43|0:18:6|[Pierre] stood at the door anxiously waiting, but the lock on the warehouse was unusually complex. [Xiao Bao], however, remained calm, risking being caught as he waited for the safe to be unlocked. The progress bar for [Xiao Bao] had only reached over 70%, while the security guard at the door was still struggling with the lock. [Pierre] was becoming impatient, but at that moment, [Xiao Bao]'s progress bar quickly reached 100%.
0:18:6|0:18:17|He and [Security Guard] almost simultaneously unlocked the lock. When the warehouse door opened and the lights came on, [Pierre] and [Security Guard] rushed in, only to see a hole in the wall and the open safe.
0:18:31|0:18:38|[Lao Mo] disguised as a waiter, carrying a wine glass towards Miss [Tingting], but deliberately spilled the wine. [Zhang Dan] then stepped forward and handed a handkerchief to [Tingting].
0:18:45|0:18:56|At this moment, [Xiao Bao] escaped to the underground parking lot with the Wing of Destiny. [Ye Hong] parked her car next to [Xiao Bao], and they drove away together. Meanwhile, [Zhang Dan] was still chatting up [Tingting].
0:19:4|0:19:31|[Zhang Dan] quietly threw a smoke bomb under his feet, filling the whole room with white smoke. The guests screamed and chaos ensued, but [Zhang Dan] remained calm, with a determined look in his eyes. Meanwhile, [Xiao Bao] and [Ye Hong] drove out of the parking lot, only to encounter [Pierre] blocking their way. Startled, [Xiao Bao] shouted, "Ye Hong!" Ye Hong stepped on the gas, crashing through the barrier at the entrance of the parking lot and speeding away.
0:19:33|0:19:57|The police were also scared and kept retreating. [Pierre] had to stop a passing car. At that moment, [Tingting] was escorted by security guards to escape from the back door. Suddenly, her assistant exclaimed, "Oh no!" [Tingting] then realized that her necklace was missing, while the culprit [Zhang Dan] was still lingering in the hotel. [Ye Hong] was speeding through the city, completely ignoring the public facilities around her.
0:19:57|0:20:10|And [Pierre] continued to pursue relentlessly. Passing by a construction site, [Pierre] made a sharp turn to avoid it, while [Ye Hong] accelerated and crashed into it. The dirt from the excavator was poured all over [Ye Hong]'s car, making it dirty and messy.
0:20:10|0:20:21|When driving down a one-way street, [Ye Hong] left [Pierre], who was almost catching up, behind. However, shortly after, [Pierre] aggressively steered the wheel and rushed forward, about to shout for [Ye Hong] to stop the car.
0:20:22|0:20:56|[Ye Hong] turned a deaf ear and took a turn onto another road. [Pierre] hurried to catch up. Unable to hold back, [Ye Hong] said, "[Pierre] had to reverse due to circumstances." They drove recklessly, swerving and crashing into things. Two vans appeared in front of them, and [Pierre] couldn't avoid them, so he had to veer towards a nearby shop. Pedestrians scattered in fear. Finally, at an intersection, [Pierre] blocked [Ye Hong]'s path.
0:20:56|0:21:21|[Ye Hong] didn't stop, gritted her teeth and rushed forward. A passerby was scared and shouted, but [Pierre] followed [Ye Hong] all the way. [Ye Hong] couldn't shake off this tailgater. The two of them raced swiftly on the mountain road, with [Pierre] looking for opportunities to overtake along the way, but [Ye Hong] easily blocked him every time. [Xiao Bao] in the passenger seat couldn't take it anymore.
0:21:21|0:21:39|After a long period of high-speed driving, he felt dizzy and nauseous. As the car entered a tunnel, [Xiao Bao] resisted the urge to vomit, his face turning red with the effort. He turned around in the back seat, grabbed his suitcase, and took out the weapons inside.
0:21:39|0:22:1|He turned to look at [Ye Hong], who anxiously pointed behind him, urging him to hurry. [Xiao Bao] climbed out of the skylight and aimed at [Pierre]. Seeing this, [Pierre] hurriedly pulled out his gun, ready to take the first shot. Unexpectedly, his bullet missed, but [Xiao Bao] accurately hit [Pierre]'s car. In an instant, [Pierre]'s car flipped over, its roof hitting the ground, sparking as it moved forward several meters.
0:22:2|0:22:8|[Xiao Bao] returned to the car, and [Ye Hong] couldn't help but exclaim:
0:22:15|0:22:25|[Xiao Bao] weakly said, leaning his head back on the seat and closing his eyes, while [Ye Hong] gradually slowed down and leisurely moved forward on the winding mountain road.
0:22:49|0:23:11|[Lao Mo] watched as [Zhang Dan] walked away without saying a word. Meanwhile, [Ye Hong] and [Xiao Bao] had already arrived at the agreed location, waiting boredly for [Zhang Dan]. Finally, [Zhang Dan] arrived on a motorcycle, and as soon as [Xiao Bao] saw her, he got off the bike with a big smile. [Zhang Dan] opened her arms with a smile, and [Xiao Bao] ran up to hug her, both of them excitedly shouting.
0:23:42|0:24:2|[Ye Hong] snatched the motorcycle key that [Zhang Dan] handed to [Xiao Bao], gave a smug look to [Xiao Bao], walked towards the motorcycle, mounted it with a confident stride, excitedly inserted the key, started the motorcycle, held a helmet with one hand, leaned forward, twisted the motorcycle handle, feeling the braking of the motorcycle.
0:24:2|0:24:22|Suddenly, a helicopter flew in from behind. [Ye Hong] stopped in her tracks and stood still. She saw [Zhang Dan] sitting in the pilot's seat, smiling at her. Beside her, [Xiao Bao] made a heart gesture towards [Ye Hong]. Angered, [Ye Hong] made a disdainful gesture towards the two. The helicopter soon took off, leaving [Ye Hong] behind.
0:24:22|0:24:28|Shortly after, the news began to report a car accident that happened during the day, and the police closed off the tunnel.
0:25:39|0:25:43|[Pierre] showed a helpless expression, got up from the chair, and walked out the door.
0:25:45|0:25:53|In the museum, [Zhang Dan]'s ex-girlfriend [Amber] pointed a laser at an ancient painting and said:
0:26:25|0:26:34|[Amber] left the museum, only to find [Pierre] waiting at the entrance. He showed his police badge, greeted [Amber], and identified himself.
0:26:49|0:26:55|[Pierre] asked [Amber] if she knew [Zhang Dan], [Amber] glanced at the photo and said, "She asked if it was stolen by [Zhang Dan]."
0:27:51|0:28:18|Night falls, a street lamp illuminates the dark street. [Amber] walks into her house, turns on the hallway light, and casually throws the keys on the table. She then enters the kitchen, looking exhausted, and sets down her backpack. The room is dimly lit, making [Amber] appear lonely. She opens the fridge, takes out a nearly empty bottle of red wine, and closes the fridge door.
0:28:18|0:28:38|On the other side, [Pierre], with a worried look on his face, poured himself a glass of wine and drank it without hesitation. The wine choked him, causing him to frown. As he lowered his head, he saw a small spider on the table. He used the glass to trap the spider on the table and imagined the spider as [Zhang Dan], muttering to himself:
0:28:40|0:28:59|Later, [Amber] nodded and poured the last of the red wine from the bottle into a glass. Her lonely expression was reflected in the window. She placed the empty bottle on the floor, and as the camera pulled back, countless empty bottles covering the floor came into view.
0:28:59|0:29:13|[Amber] sat on the floor, staring out of the window in a daze. Then she took out the business card of [Pierre] from her pocket, gazing at it for a long time, struggling internally. She then continued to look out the window, lost in thought.
0:29:13|0:29:22|On the other side, [Pierre] was still playing with the spider when his phone rang. He answered the call, and [Amber] said on the other end:
0:29:33|0:29:41|Pierre did not answer, but simply moved the glass on the table and let the little spider go.
0:29:48|0:29:53|At this moment, Zhang Dan and Xiao Bao have arrived in Prague, Czech Republic, ready to proceed with their next plan.
0:29:53|0:30:18|At dusk, a bus drove through the bustling streets of Prague, stopping at a platform where waiting passengers crowded on. [Zhang Dan] and [Xiao Bao] slowly got off the bus from the back door and headed straight to a Chinese restaurant named Purple Qi Coming. An old man with a white beard walked out of the restaurant, quickly locking eyes with [Zhang Dan], then hurriedly left.
0:30:18|0:30:24|At this moment, [King Kong] revealed his muscular arms, polishing a stick with a machine.
0:30:28|0:30:42|[Zhang Dan] and [Xiao Bao] arrived at a night market, where a man approached them and told them that Uncle Gang was waiting for them. They entered a room and saw a tightly locked door. They knocked on it, and the person inside opened a small window on the door, looked at them coldly, and then opened the door for them to enter.
0:30:43|0:30:51|[King Kong] stopped his work, turned around and walked towards [Zhang Dan], giving him a big hug.
0:30:54|0:31:15|[Zhang Dan] gestured to [Xiao Bao] behind him, who handed over a cloth bag. [King Kong] opened the bag and took out the Wing of Destiny. Satisfied, [King Kong] put away the Wing of Destiny, then turned and walked towards the safe. [Zhang Dan] picked up the Russian nesting dolls on [King Kong]'s desk and asked:
0:31:30|0:31:35|The two exchanged pleasantries, [King Kong] took an envelope from the safe and locked the door.
0:31:48|0:32:3|[Zhang Dan] took the envelope and pulled out the check to take a look. Perplexed, he showed the amount to [King Kong], realizing it was a bit short. [King Kong] handed [Zhang Dan] a set of Russian nesting dolls.
0:32:21|0:32:25|[Zhang Dan] opens the Matryoshka doll, inside which a person's tongue is preserved in a glass bottle.
0:32:44|0:32:54|[King Kong] pretended to be mysterious, took off his glasses and said:
0:33:7|0:33:22|[Zhang Dan] looked shocked, leaned back in the chair, then smirked with red eyes. [Zhang Dan] regained composure, with a fierce look in his eyes.
0:33:39|0:33:46|[Zhang Dan] lowered her eyes and furrowed her brows, while [King Kong] turned his head and fiddled with the nesting dolls on the table.
0:34:2|0:34:20|[King Kong] smiled, [Zhang Dan] said: [Zhang Dan] was still immersed in sorrow and anger, his voice choked. After leaving, [Zhang Dan] and [Xiao Bao] walked on the street.
0:34:37|0:34:44|[Zhang Dan] turned his head and saw a person wrapped up tightly following them on the street.
0:34:51|0:35:19|The two of them reached a fork in the road and split up instinctively. [Zhang Dan] jogged to a bus stop, where he joined the crowd waiting and boarded the bus. The crowded bus had people standing in the aisle, but [Zhang Dan] made his way in and found a seat with fewer people. Leaning against a handrail, the bus started moving unsteadily. [Zhang Dan] glanced at the rearview mirror and noticed the pursuer had also boarded the bus.
0:35:19|0:35:28|The tracker approached [Zhang Dan], and when [Zhang Dan] took a closer look, he realized it was actually [Amber]. He smiled with joy.
0:35:50|0:36:10|During the conversation, [Amber] secretly placed a chip on [Zhang Dan]'s phone. [Zhang Dan]'s eyes gradually moistened as he solemnly said, "Amber's words hurt him." His expression instantly turned cold, and he turned and left.
0:36:10|0:36:15|Car. [Amber] stood still, stunned by the back of [Zhang Dan].
0:36:15|0:36:30|Tears welled up in her eyes as a car parked under the street lamp. [Pierre] and [Amber] were hacking into [Zhang Dan]'s phone on a laptop. [Pierre] opened the photo album, revealing pictures of [Amber] and [Zhang Dan] in love.
0:36:31|0:36:50|[Pierre] glanced at [Amber], made a witty remark, [Amber] awkwardly rolled her eyes, [Pierre] looked at the photos and surprisingly enjoyed them, [Amber] quickly interrupted him and asked him to try another folder, [Pierre] tactfully stopped and [Amber] pulled a chair over and sat down.
0:36:50|0:36:58|[Pierre] found a dynamic image of GAIA in the folder and blurted out, to which [Amber] nodded and said:
0:37:2|0:37:10|At the same time, Zhang Dan discovered the chip on the phone.
0:37:23|0:37:43|[Xiao Bao] had just finished speaking when a motorcycle approached at the end of the tunnel. The headlights shone on Xiao Bao's puzzled face. [Ye Hong] stopped in front of them, took off her helmet, and shook her long hair confidently. Xiao Bao couldn't help but show a silly smile at Ye Hong, only coming to his senses under [Zhang Dan]'s gaze.
0:37:43|0:37:50|The next day, Zhang Dan, Ye Hong, and Amber drove past a field of sunflowers, the sunlight shining down beautifully.
0:37:50|0:38:12|[Zhang Dan] parked the car on the side of the road, turned around and stretched, saying to [Xiao Bao] behind him. He pushed open the car door, got out of the car, walked into the sunflower field, pushed aside the sunflowers as tall as a person and walked towards the depths. Inside the car, [Xiao Bao] leaned forward and said to the absent-minded [Ye Hong]. [Xiao Bao] took off his sunglasses and said:
0:38:18|0:38:30|[Ye Hong] rolled her eyes and looked at [Xiao Bao]. [Xiao Bao] mysteriously took out a small urination device from his bag and handed it to [Ye Hong]. [Ye Hong] looked puzzled and asked:
0:38:42|0:38:48|She rolled her eyes and turned her body to the other side, just then [Zhang Dan] came back.
0:38:56|0:39:24|[Ye Hong] snatched the tool from [Xiao Bao]'s hand and threw it out of the window in one swift motion, disappearing in the blink of an eye. Afterwards, the three of them drove the car to a quiet forest. [Zhang Dan] was the first to get out of the car. He squatted down in front of an open space, picked up the binoculars hanging around his neck, and observed the front. [Xiao Bao] and [Ye Hong] followed closely behind, approaching to look in the direction of [Zhang Dan]'s gaze.
0:39:24|0:39:41|[Xiao Bao] took out a box containing a high-tech aerial drone and monitor. He handed the monitor to [Zhang Dan], then threw the round aerial drone into the air. The drone unfolded three propellers in the air and flew off into the distance.
0:39:41|0:39:48|From the aerial view of a drone, a castle is nestled among the trees, beautiful and mysterious.
0:39:48|0:39:59|[Xiao Bao] returned to [Zhang Dan] and [Ye Hong], squatting down beside them. The three of them stared at the monitor screen together, with [Zhang Dan] controlling the direction of the drone. Finally, they captured the figure of the owner at the entrance of the castle.
0:40:6|0:40:31|[Ye Hong] confidently agreed, [Zhang Dan] gave her a thumbs up, and the three of them split up. [Ye Hong] returned to the car and took out a handbag from the back seat. [Zhang Dan] ran all the way to the castle, hiding in the bushes to observe the surroundings. [Xiao Bao] stayed in place, continuing to use the drone to survey the area around the castle. After a thorough scan, the monitor displayed a dense array of surveillance cameras.
0:40:31|0:40:44|In the setting around the castle, [Ye Hong] put on a pair of black-framed glasses at this moment. She pulled down the collar of her dress, revealing a side of her fragrant shoulder, and walked towards the castle calmly and confidently.
0:40:44|0:40:50|On the other side, [Zhang Dan] was using binoculars to observe the castle at close range and also noticed the tight surveillance.
0:40:51|0:41:13|The owner of the castle, [Charlie], dressed in sportswear, jogged into the woods surrounded by bodyguards. [Ye Hong] took a small dog out of her bag and walked towards [Charlie] and his group. [Charlie] was holding a big black dog and when he saw [Ye Hong], he shouted at her. [Charlie] quickly grabbed the leash, and [Ye Hong] deliberately made a scared expression.
0:41:13|0:41:21|While soothing the small dog in her arms, she turned and walked away. [Charlie]'s gaze, however, stayed fixed on her.
0:41:37|0:41:47|[Zhang Dan] and [Ye Hong] got on the car, leaving [Xiao Bao] standing alone in a daze. Later, [Pierre] arrived at [Charlie]'s company and approached to stop [Charlie] who was about to enter the company.
0:41:52|0:42:12|[Charlie] nodded, [Pierre] said: [Charlie] glanced at the person beside him and sneered, [Pierre] reminded him that these people were not ordinary thieves, and told him that they had already obtained the other two parts of GAIA, leaving only the Spring of Spirits. [Charlie] was extremely arrogant.
0:42:22|0:42:46|[Charlie] bid farewell to [Pierre], arrogantly put on sunglasses and turned away. [Pierre] muttered helplessly, then [Charlie] arrived at his own vineyard, where various distinguished guests were gathered. Accompanied by two bodyguards, [Charlie] walked in and clinked glasses with every guest he passed. As he turned a corner, he suddenly stopped and looked back.
0:42:47|0:43:8|[Ye Hong] was holding a glass of red wine in the dark, carefully tasting the wine. [Charlie] looked at her affectionately and walked up to her, saying, "[Ye Hong]" showed a charming smile. [Charlie] looked at her admiringly, but [Ye Hong] showed a displeased expression towards the wine in the glass.
0:44:3|0:44:12|[Charlie] smiled broadly, mysteriously pulled out his phone from his pocket, and then opened a music app.
0:44:24|0:44:41|[Charlie] looked expectantly, [Ye Hong] pouted and after a moment of serious consideration, said: [Ye Hong] turned around and left gracefully, leaving [Charlie] behind feeling pleased with himself.
0:44:41|0:44:56|In a luxury suite of a hotel, [Zhang Dan] is tirelessly studying the castle, with three monitors displaying formulas next to a notebook. [Ye Hong] is leisurely lying on the sofa with a face mask on, while [Xiao Bao] asks:
0:45:12|0:45:16|As soon as the words fell, a text message came from [Charlie], followed by a phone call. [Ye Hong] looked smugly at [Xiao Bao].
0:45:34|0:45:41|[Zhang Dan] hurriedly came over and made an OK gesture to [Ye Hong],
0:46:6|0:46:10|Facing the innocent Xiao Bao, Zhang Dan couldn't help but laugh and stood up to pat his shoulder.
0:46:12|0:46:25|On the agreed date, a small car drove on the mountain road, with the castle on the mountaintop towering majestically among the trees, looking grand and magnificent from afar.
0:46:25|0:46:31|The small car stopped in the woods near the castle, with [Pierre] and [Amber] sitting inside.
0:46:43|0:46:51|After saying that, both of them laughed. [Pierre] took out a telescope and observed ahead, while [Amber] asked expressionlessly:
0:47:2|0:47:32|Pierre's emotions were suddenly ignited. He pushed open the car door, got out of the car, leaned against the front of the car to continue observing the movement of the castle. [Amber] also got out of the car closely behind him. After closing the car door, she put her hands in the pockets of her trench coat, slowly walked to Pierre's side, and finally said: Pierre put down the binoculars, calmed his emotions, sighed, and said:
0:47:45|0:48:11|Pierre was lost in memories, his barely conscious face reflected in the shattered rearview mirror. Suddenly, [Zhang Dan] appeared and slowly climbed into the overturned and scrapped police car. With all his strength, Zhang Dan shouted as he dragged the unconscious Pierre out. He moved Pierre's heavy body to a safer distance, and soon after, the police car exploded.
0:48:14|0:48:31|[Zhang Dan] was knocked out and flew out, with broken stones scattered all over the ground. He staggered to his feet, only to be knocked down by a mysterious person riding a motorcycle, and he passed out. After getting what he wanted, the person did not leave but instead stopped and took the Forest Eye from [Zhang Dan]'s pocket.
0:48:31|0:48:38|He spat on the unconscious Zhang Dan with a patterned tongue, then rode away on a motorcycle.
0:48:40|0:48:51|Several police cars arrived late, completely unaware of the motorcycle. Pierre woke up at the sound of the sirens, with Zhang Dan lying on the ground beside the shattered car.
0:49:6|0:49:14|Pierre finished speaking, then turned to look at [Amber] with eyes filled with anger and determination.
0:49:14|0:49:20|[Amber] understood Pierre's determination and nodded knowingly. As she came to her senses,
0:49:20|0:49:31|Pierre picked up the binoculars and saw a car approaching in front of the castle. A man opened the back door, and out came Ye Hong. Pierre recognized her at a glance.
0:49:36|0:49:56|[Ye Hong] followed the bodyguard into the castle, wearing glasses with a recording function. She then adjusted the angle of the surveillance and asked [Zhang Dan], adjusting her glasses frame. [Zhang Dan] and [Xiao Bao] in the hotel could see everything [Ye Hong] could see through the monitor clearly.
0:49:56|0:50:4|The two carefully observed the structure of the castle, with [Ye Hong] slowing down her pace and not missing a single detail.
0:50:12|0:50:31|Before long, [Ye Hong] arrived at [Charlie]'s office, where a servant brought out exquisite tea set to entertain [Ye Hong]. The office was decorated in a classical and luxurious style, and the two sat facing each other across the desk. [Zhang Dan] and [Xiao Bao] listened attentively at the other end.
0:51:27|0:51:33|Charlie was stunned, but he was completely unguarded against Ye Hong and blurted out without much thought.
0:52:20|0:52:28|[Charlie] aimed a remote control at a stone statue and pressed a button, the door of the secret room creaked open.
0:52:32|0:52:40|[Ye Hong] held a machine ball in the hand behind her.
0:52:50|0:52:57|A large black dog suddenly appears,
0:53:4|0:53:8|[Ye Hong] adjusted her glasses and smiled patiently.
0:53:16|0:53:29|[Ye Hong] took out a camera from her bag, while [Charlie] proudly stood next to the Fountain of Spirits, striking various poses.
0:53:34|0:53:40|[Charlie] always obliges [Ye Hong], turning around to press his hand against the glass. Only the fingerprints of all ten fingers can open the glass door.
0:54:5|0:54:13|[Ye Hong] turned and walked to the door, looked up at the surveillance camera above, and stood on the ladder.
0:54:39|0:54:50|However, the figure of [Charlie], who was no longer in the camera, successfully captured the panoramic view of the secret room.
0:55:1|0:55:11|[Ye Hong] walked out of the castle, while a tour guide was explaining the story of the castle to the tourists. Meanwhile, [Pierre], who was lurking in the woods, finally got his prey and was ready to make his move.
0:55:13|0:55:34|He glanced at the crowd of tourists beside him, then looked towards where [Ye Hong] was, only to find that she had already walked far away. He quickly put down the binoculars and ran towards the castle, pushing through the crowded people and rushing into the castle. [Ye Hong] immediately spotted [Pierre] from afar, cleverly blending in with the tourists and successfully slipping away from under Pierre's eyes.
0:55:34|0:55:38|[Pierre] stood still, looking around helplessly,
0:55:40|0:56:4|Defeated once again, [Pierre] came to the shooting range to vent his emotions, hitting the bullseye with every shot. Just as he took off his earmuffs to reload, a shot hit [Pierre]'s target next to him. [Pierre] shouted: The person greeted him with a familiar voice, [Pierre] immediately became alert, turned around and pointed the gun at him, saying:
0:56:45|0:56:54|The security guard broke in, [Pierre] turned around, and [Zhang Dan] disappeared without a trace.
0:56:54|0:56:59|In the cafe, [Pierre] took a sip of water and said to [Amber]:
0:57:1|0:57:8|[Amber] glanced at the necklace on the table and said:
0:57:17|0:57:24|Amber shook her head with a smile, but Pierre continued:
0:57:32|0:57:40|[Pierre] looked out the window, memories flooding back.
0:57:48|0:58:6|[Pierre] pretended to be relaxed, but his eyes turned red as the scene of his father being arrested flashed before him. The glass reflected a fourteen-year-old [Pierre] and his disappointed face.
0:58:15|0:58:21|[Pierre] turned to look at [Amber], who asked with moist eyes:
0:58:38|0:58:47|[Pierre] regained his composure and said, "[Amber] is feeling down." He then changed the subject and asked:
0:58:47|0:58:55|At this moment, [Amber] had let her guard down against [Pierre] and after some contemplation, she slowly spoke:
0:59:30|0:59:38|At this moment, [Pierre] received an invitation letter. He opened it and said:
0:59:48|0:59:55|At this moment, [Ye Hong] and [Xiao Bao] have already taken action. They arrived at a run-down warehouse, where [Ye Hong] walked down the stairs and said:
1:0:5|1:0:24|Xiao Bao lay on the skateboard, slid out from under the car, still holding the repair tools in his hand. He put down the wrench, took off his gloves, and walked towards Ye Hong. Ye Hong had her back to him. Xiao Bao approached and helped her fasten the fingerprint scanner around her waist. Suddenly, his expression turned gloomy.
1:0:51|1:1:5|[Ye Hong] frowned and said, "[Xiao Bao], in a hurry, loosened the rope and carefully helped her tie it. After securing the scanner, [Xiao Bao] turned and walked towards the computer desk, skillfully activating the device."
1:1:5|1:1:40|[Ye Hong] put on her clothes, adjusted her suspenders, and said to [Xiao Bao]. [Xiao Bao] walked behind [Ye Hong], put his hands around her waist, and looked back at the computer screen. Unexpectedly, it showed a scanning failure. [Ye Hong] turned around, grabbed [Xiao Bao]'s hand, and said. [Ye Hong] looked up at him, their eyes met. [Xiao Bao]'s hand was held tightly by [Ye Hong], pressing against her waist. [Xiao Bao] swallowed nervously, lifted his head without daring to look at her. [Ye Hong] glanced at the monitor and saw that the scan was successful.
1:2:7|1:2:15|He placed the model truck on a small road, accompanied by the explanation from [Zhang Dan], ready to start the operation.
1:2:15|1:2:28|In the truck compartment are [Xiao Bao] and [Zhang Dan]. [Xiao Bao] looks at the large wine barrel beside him with a furrowed brow. The gatekeeper at the winery opens the gate upon seeing the driver's proof.
1:2:30|1:2:39|[Lao Mo] rolled two huge wine barrels down the hallway of the winery.
1:2:50|1:3:4|He picked up a model figure and showed it to Xiao Bao, then threw it into the model tunnel on the table. Xiao Bao slid down to the ground along the ladder steadily, while Zhang Dan searched for an exit in the winery alone.
1:3:7|1:3:19|[Xiao Bao] slowly approaches the control room. A group of security guards are celebrating a colleague's birthday, but the next moment they are all knocked out by tranquilizers. [Xiao Bao] appears at the door holding a tranquilizer gun, takes out everyone, and quickly locks the door.
1:3:24|1:3:39|[Zhang Dan] agilely shuttles on the outer wall of the castle, while [Xiao Bao] is tapping on the keyboard in the control room, changing the timestamps of all the cameras. Soon, one by one, the people on the surveillance screens all disappeared.
1:3:40|1:4:10|[Zhang Dan] received the signal, leaped down from the outer wall, and landed smoothly on the grass. He quickly ran towards the castle, looked up at the observation tower tens of meters high, then pressed a mechanism on his backpack. A rope shot out with an eagle claw tightly grabbing the top of the observation tower. He pressed a button and leaped up, then climbed onto a platform. With his back against the castle wall, he pressed another mechanism, and four small wheels instantly popped out of his backpack.
1:4:10|1:4:26|At this moment, [Xiao Bao] in the control room was staring at the screen intently, urgently helping [Zhang Dan] deactivate the mechanisms inside the castle. [Zhang Dan] slid along the wall smoothly and reached the top of the observation tower. He carefully opened the door to the observation room and walked in.
1:4:26|1:4:57|In the center of the room, there is a round lid that can be opened. [Xiao Bao] snapped his fingers and confidently said, "Let's rewind time a few days back." On the day when [Ye Hong] followed [Charlie] into the secret room, she took the opportunity to throw the machine ball in her hand to the side, where it adhered to the underside of a nearby table. Meanwhile, [Zhang Dan] had already opened the lid in the room, revealing the path to the secret room.
1:4:57|1:5:0|However, it was filled with intricate and complex laser beams.
1:5:0|1:5:4|Laser. In the control room, [Xiao Bao] is operating the computer non-stop.
1:5:4|1:5:26|Before long, the defense system was deactivated. [Zhang Dan] looked up at the ceiling and formulated a plan. She took off her eye mask, and [Xiao Bao] breathed a sigh of relief as he relaxed his hands behind his head. In the ballroom, a band played dance music. The guests at the banquet were all dressed up, men and women paired off, dancing gracefully to the music.
1:5:26|1:5:29|Charlie was dancing with a female partner when [Ye Hong] appeared.
1:5:31|1:5:46|She changed into an elegant and beautiful gown, standing at the door smiling at Charlie. Then she walked in with her skirt held up, Charlie was already captivated, slowly walking towards [Ye Hong] as if under a spell, with a smile in his eyes, saying:
1:5:55|1:6:21|Charlie reached out his left hand to [Ye Hong]. [Ye Hong] placed her hand on his, and the two walked into the ballroom. Meanwhile, [Zhang Dan] had already hung himself upside down in the center of the atrium, carefully observing his surroundings. His gaze finally landed on a hole in the floor, and he slowly slid down the rope, discovering that in each room on every floor, there was a similar hole in the same position.
1:6:21|1:6:36|At the end of the tunnel is Charlie's secret room. At this moment, a security guard in the control room gradually wakes up. He opens his eyes and reaches behind him. Xiao Bao, staring at the screen, is unaware, and is grabbed by the shoulder from behind by the security guard and pushed to the side.
1:6:38|1:6:46|The security guard hurriedly stepped forward to restart the laser net. [Xiao Bao] got up and wrestled with him, while [Zhang Dan], just one step away from the destination, was blocked by the restarted laser net.
1:6:46|1:7:3|[Xiao Bao] fought with the security guard, but was punched and sent flying due to the difference in strength. [Zhang Dan] quickly climbed up using a rope to avoid the lasers chasing from behind. Thinking quickly, [Xiao Bao] grabbed the keyboard from the table and smashed it towards the security guard, then lunged towards the computer, trying to turn the situation around.
1:7:4|1:7:30|The security guard quickly counterattacked, grabbing [Xiao Bao] from behind. Seizing the opportunity, [Xiao Bao] picked up the tranquilizer gun on the table. The guard reached out to grab it, but [Xiao Bao] used all his strength to twist the gun towards the guard's thigh. The guard, who was hit twice, immediately lost consciousness and fell heavily on top of [Xiao Bao]. [Xiao Bao] exerted all his strength to push him away, enduring the pain and quickly getting up.
1:7:30|1:7:47|At this moment, [Zhang Dan]'s clothes have been burned off, and just as the situation hangs by a thread, the laser net is finally shut down. [Zhang Dan] breathes a sigh of relief and looks down. Despite everything returning to calm, he dares not act rashly. [Xiao Bao] gasps for breath and explains:
1:7:55|1:8:9|After understanding the situation, [Zhang Dan] slid into the secret room with relief, skillfully untying the ropes, while Charlie was still intoxicated in the tenderness of [Ye Hong].
1:8:16|1:8:31|[Ye Hong] took the opportunity to hold Charlie's hand and slowly pulled it towards her waist where the fingerprint collector was hidden. Just then, the band switched to a tango dance music, and Charlie followed the strong beat, twisting and turning.
1:8:31|1:8:36|[Xiao Bao] in the control room, saw everything and helplessly reported the situation.
1:8:36|1:8:54|[Ye Hong] couldn't help but roll her eyes, took a deep breath, and attacked again. She placed her hand on [Charlie]'s shoulder, forcing him to turn around, then forcefully pulled his hand and placed it on her waist. [Xiao Bao] couldn't sit still, feeling jealous, and stared intently at the screen.
1:8:57|1:9:5|[Charlie] took the opportunity to touch [Ye Hong]'s thigh, but she quickly grabbed his hand and placed it back on his waist.
1:9:12|1:9:35|[Xiao Bao] couldn't wait and called a halt. [Ye Hong] stopped and turned away from [Charlie]'s reluctant gaze. She then took out a remote control and transmitted the fingerprint information to [Xiao Bao]. At this moment, [Zhang Dan] also arrived at the entrance of the secret room. Leaning against the wall, he reported the situation to his teammates. [Xiao Bao] took out a remote control, pressed the switch, and said:
1:9:38|1:10:9|[Zhang Dan] anxiously waited at the door. The machine ball hidden under the table by [Ye Hong] received a signal and was ready to go. Soon, the machine ball was successfully activated, transforming into an eight-legged machine spider. [Xiao Bao] turned on the camera on the spider's head to observe the environment in the secret room. After confirming it was safe, [Xiao Bao] controlled the spider to start moving. Before long, the spider crawled down from the stone pillar along the wall to the ground, carefully making its way towards the door. Outside the door, [Zhang Dan] was extremely worried.
1:10:9|1:10:14|Constantly checking the time on his watch, just then [Charlie]'s big black dog suddenly appeared,
1:10:23|1:10:54|The spider struggled desperately as the big black dog bit off one of its legs. [Xiao Bao], feeling sorry, pressed the button on the remote control. The big black dog was fiercely shocked by the spider and hastily fled, leaving the spider behind. The spider quickly got up, transformed into a small ball, and rolled forward. Before long, the mechanical ball rolled to the door of the secret room and transformed back into an eight-legged spider. It climbed up the door while shooting a laser beam, searching for the location of the door lock.
1:10:54|1:11:7|The gate, under the scanning of the laser, seemed to turn into a transparent door. Before long, the spider found the keyhole, lifted a leg and turned it into a welding torch, instantly sparking a blaze.
1:11:7|1:11:13|Charlie is still waiting for Ye Hong in the banquet hall. The servant approached and said:
1:11:15|1:11:36|[Charlie] followed the servant's gaze and saw [Pierre] approaching hurriedly to greet him. Meanwhile, on the other side, Little Spider was still busy picking the lock, and [Ye Hong] was completely unaware of [Pierre]'s arrival. She was searching for [Charlie] among the guests immersed in dancing, but unexpectedly spotted [Pierre]. She quickly reported the situation to [Zhang Dan].
1:11:41|1:12:8|Everyone was waiting for [Xiao Bao], who remained calm and composed, controlling the small spider without any hurry. His movements unconsciously quickened, and soon the spider penetrated the gate, causing a flicker of electricity. At that moment, [Charlie], who had just learned the truth from [Pierre], turned back with a red-eyed gaze, locking eyes with [Ye Hong] at the entrance of the banquet hall. Realizing she had been exposed, [Ye Hong] looked guilty, while [Pierre] stood by, teasingly watching the two.
1:12:8|1:12:17|At this moment, Spider successfully unlocked it, the stone statue at the door lit up green, and then the door opened, allowing the big black dog to leisurely run out.
1:12:17|1:12:29|The unsuspecting big black dog thought its owner had arrived, wagging its tail and running out to meet [Zhang Dan], while [Xiao Bao] was still immersed in the joy of victory, only to see the situation in the banquet hall the next second.
1:12:29|1:12:39|[Ye Hong] wanted to escape, but was surrounded by police and security guards who came from all directions, and was locked in the banquet hall by [Pierre]. [Zhang Dan] ran into a secret room, with [Xiao Bao]'s voice ringing in his ears.
1:12:40|1:12:52|[Zhang Dan] stood still, frowning in silence, then looked towards the Fountain of Spirits in front of him, made up his mind, took off his gloves, and [Xiao Bao] had to compromise.
1:12:57|1:13:4|[Pierre] reminded [Charlie] and he took out his phone to see through the surveillance camera that everything in the secret room was normal.
1:13:4|1:13:12|At this moment, the big black dog that should have been in the secret room suddenly appeared, and [Pierre] said, "[Charlie], now you finally realize."
1:13:14|1:13:32|[Charlie] hurriedly led the people to the secret room, [Pierre] subdued [Ye Hong] and handcuffed her to the piano. [Charlie] and a group of security guards were running frantically in the hallway, [Zhang Dan] put on special gloves, anxiously waiting for the progress bar above, and finally received the fingerprint information in the nick of time.
1:13:34|1:13:42|[Charlie] and his group climbed the stairs. [Zhang Dan] had successfully opened the glass cabinet of the Fountain of Spirits, and she took the Fountain of Spirits in one go.
1:13:44|1:13:55|[Xiao Bao] hesitated with a furrowed brow, concerned about [Ye Hong]'s safety. At this moment, [Charlie] and the security guards finally arrived at the secret room. Upon seeing the empty glass cabinet, [Charlie] said coldly:
1:13:58|1:14:16|At that moment, security guards all over Chenbao received instructions and armed themselves, preparing to move out. [Ye Hong], who was being held in the banquet hall, had resigned herself to her fate, biting her lip and giving up struggling. Suddenly, [Xiao Bao] burst in, shooting down the police guarding [Ye Hong] with a tranquilizer gun. He then unlocked her handcuffs. Perplexed, [Ye Hong] asked:
1:14:20|1:14:37|The security guards were fully armed, wearing helmets and riding motorcycles, leaving the castle and chasing towards the direction of the woods. [Zhang Dan] disguised himself as a security guard and hid in the team. Once out of the castle, he took another route, and the security guards were completely unaware, allowing him to escape right under their noses.
1:14:37|1:14:43|At this moment, [Pierre] drove to the castle with [Amber] to search for [Zhang Dan].
1:14:43|1:15:12|[Xiao Bao] missed the best time to escape in order to save [Ye Hong]. The two left the castle at great risk, but were already being watched by security guards behind them. Meanwhile, [Zhang Dan] thought he had shaken off the pursuers, but [Pierre] and [Amber] had already found him. [Ye Hong], wearing a cumbersome gown, ran with [Xiao Bao] through the woods. Soon, they were surrounded by the approaching security guards. They had to change direction, and one guard fired a shot at [Ye Hong], but the bullet narrowly missed and hit a tree instead.
1:15:13|1:15:31|The road in the forest was rugged, making it difficult for [Ye Hong] to run with her skirt held up. At this moment, [Xiao Bao] lifted a large piece of grass covering the ground, revealing a hidden beach motorcycle underneath. This sight left [Ye Hong] speechless. The security team, not to be underestimated, quickly rode their motorcycles to catch up.
1:15:31|1:15:58|On the mountain road, [Zhang Dan] rode his motorcycle rapidly, evading the pursuit of [Pierre] and [Amber]. Desperate, he drove into a construction site with several trucks coming in and out. [Pierre] chased closely behind, leaving him no way out. On the side, [Amber] looked worried. Meanwhile, [Xiao Bao] and [Ye Hong] were also being closely followed by security guards on motorcycles. [Zhang Dan] tried to take a shortcut and rushed into the construction site.
1:15:58|1:16:16|Who knew [Pierre] was the first to reach the end of the road. [Zhang Dan] accelerated and rushed past, once again leaving [Pierre] behind. Seeing [Pierre] pull out a gun, [Amber] hurriedly stopped him. [Pierre] assured that he wouldn't take his life. [Pierre] fired repeatedly at [Zhang Dan], although avoiding hitting his body, he successfully disrupted him.
1:16:16|1:16:39|At this moment, [Xiao Bao] is riding a beach motorcycle with [Ye Hong], the two of them weaving through the trees. The security guards show no mercy towards the unarmed duo, as they run and dodge the hail of bullets behind them. The road on the mountain is under construction, and [Zhang Dan] encounters several large trucks shortly after, but he doesn't slow down. Instead, he accelerates and swerves sharply just before the collision.
1:16:39|1:16:52|He crossed over the large rocks by the roadside, trying to take a shortcut to shake off Pierre. Xiao Bao and Ye Hong had already escaped from the woods and arrived at a clearing. Without any cover, their situation became even more dangerous.
1:16:52|1:17:2|[Zhang Dan] tried all his tricks but couldn't shake off [Pierre]. Instead, he ended up covered in dirt, running forward like a headless fly, only to find there was no way ahead.
1:17:2|1:17:3|[Pierre] made a tough decision,
1:17:8|1:17:21|In the same desperate situation, [Xiao Bao] and [Ye Hong] arrived at the riverbank. Instead of stopping the car, [Xiao Bao] drove into the water. He pressed a button on the front of the car, and the tires on both sides instantly started spinning, transforming the car into a speedboat.
1:17:21|1:17:30|The security guards stood on the shore watching helplessly as the two people left. [Zhang Dan] was shot and fell to the ground in pain, rolling around, and the motorcycle was flung out.
1:17:31|1:17:39|[Pierre] stopped the car, pointed a gun at [Zhang Dan], got out of the car, and walked towards him with big steps, shouting:
1:17:42|1:17:46|[Zhang Dan] struggled to get up, threw his helmet to the ground, and shouted at [Pierre]:
1:17:46|1:18:0|[Pierre] sneered, but [Zhang Dan] remained indifferent, turning towards the motorcycle. A shot fired by [Pierre] landed near [Zhang Dan]'s feet, forcing her to stop.
1:18:9|1:18:29|Sitting in the car, [Amber] looked at the coerced [Zhang Dan] with a heartbroken expression. [Pierre] pointed a gun at [Zhang Dan]'s head, trying to force him to surrender. Suddenly, a car rushed towards them. Unable to dodge in time, [Pierre] fell to the ground. He did not expect that [Amber] would actually switch sides at the critical moment and betray him.
1:18:29|1:18:36|[Pierre] stood up, looking in the direction where the two were running away, standing still in a daze, unable to come back to his senses for a long time.
1:18:36|1:18:42|[Amber] and [Zhang Dan] raced all the way, soon escaping onto the highway, both remaining silent along the way.
1:18:44|1:18:50|[Zhang Dan] sat in the passenger seat, stealing glances at [Amber] from time to time, but unsure of how to break the silence.
1:18:50|1:18:56|He pondered for a long time, couldn't help but turn his head and stare at [Amber], hesitated to speak, and [Amber] reproached him:
1:19:32|1:19:55|After five years, [Zhang Dan] finally revealed his secret to [Amber]. As [Amber] turned around and saw [Zhang Dan] bleeding from his arm, she softly said, "[Zhang Dan], despite the pain from your wound." [Zhang Dan] joked with a smile, ignoring the pain, and [Amber] couldn't help but laugh. The two reconciled and let go of their past grievances.
1:20:32|1:20:37|[King Kong] suddenly appeared, leading a group of people walking out from the nearby woods.
1:20:37|1:21:9|[Zhang Dan], along with the others, stood still in their tracks, dropping their parachutes. Two groups faced each other at the edge of the cliff, with [King Kong] staring at [Zhang Dan] with a smile on his face. The smile on [King Kong]'s face twitched slightly as he reached out to the side, and his men quickly pulled out their guns and aimed at them.
1:21:18|1:21:41|[Zhang Dan] reached for the gun behind him, only to be snatched away by [Ye Hong]. [Ye Hong] pointed the gun at [Zhang Dan], while [King Kong] looked at [Ye Hong] with a satisfied smile. [Zhang Dan] with red eyes, smiled at [Ye Hong], the muscles on his face twitching.
1:21:44|1:21:53|[Ye Hong] pointed a gun at [Amber] and led her to walk behind [King Kong], while [King Kong] proudly waved the Spring of Spirits in front of [Zhang Dan].
1:21:53|1:22:0|At the same time, [Pierre] led a large number of police cars along the mountain road to come and arrest Zhang Dan and his group.
1:22:0|1:22:9|[Ye Hong] quickly boarded the plane with [King Kong]'s men and took [Amber] with her. [Zhang Dan] looked on helplessly at everything happening before her.
1:22:9|1:22:13|King Kong threatened Zhang Dan even after boarding the plane.
1:22:16|1:22:34|The helicopter slowly took off, with Zhang Dan shouting: Xiao Bao finally reacted and quickly took out a spider to throw towards the helicopter. The spider successfully stuck to the bottom of the helicopter and slowly disappeared from their sight as it went further away.
1:22:34|1:22:48|At this moment, a large group of police officers arrived at the mountaintop. The two turned around and found themselves surrounded. One of the police officers, holding a megaphone, shouted loudly:
1:22:49|1:22:54|[Pierre] stepped out of the car, glaring angrily at [Zhang Dan].
1:23:0|1:23:17|Watching the approaching police force, [Xiao Bao] no longer hesitated. He turned around and jumped off the cliff. Dozens of heavily armed police officers swarmed from all directions, closing in on [Zhang Dan]. [Zhang Dan] gave up resistance, slowly raised his hands above his head, waiting to be captured.
1:23:17|1:23:30|In the police station, two police officers stood guard at the door of the interrogation room, watching over Zhang Dan. He sat at the table with his head down, handcuffed. A chubby officer paced beside him and asked:
1:23:33|1:23:38|[Zhang Dan]'s archenemy [Pierre] appeared at the door, and the chubby policeman opened the door and said:
1:23:40|1:23:45|[Pierre] cut to the chase and asked:
1:23:52|1:23:58|[Pierre] pulled up a chair and sat down, asking about the whereabouts of [Zhang Dan] and [King Kong]. [Zhang Dan] shook her head and replied,
1:24:7|1:24:16|[Zhang Dan] calmly glanced at the camera in the room, then leaned in towards [Pierre] and said:
1:24:42|1:25:5|[Zhang Dan] nodded firmly, [Pierre] let down his guard and took out the key to unlock the handcuffs for him. [Pierre] looked at [Zhang Dan] without a word. This time, he chose to trust his opponent. Meanwhile, [King Kong] had already escaped to Kiev, Ukraine with a group of people. Outside an inconspicuous unfinished building, surrounded by overgrown weeds, two cars were parked downstairs.
1:25:5|1:25:22|Several people were loitering around the car, surreptitiously keeping an eye on their surroundings. Inside the abandoned building, [Amber] was tied to a chair, with a few people watching over her. [King Kong] carried a briefcase down the stairs, then placed it on a table next to [Amber].
1:25:22|1:25:31|He looked at [Amber] with a sneer, then smugly opened the box to reveal three necklaces that formed the complete GAIA.
1:25:32|1:26:3|[Ye Hong] sat on a wooden crate, expressionless, watching [King Kong]. Suddenly, she noticed a spider quietly moving in the corner. As [King Kong] picked up the crate to leave, [Ye Hong] stopped him. Meanwhile, [Zhang Dan] and [Xiao Bao] had followed them to the vicinity of the abandoned building. Sitting in the car, they stared at the computer screen. With the spider under surveillance, they knew everything happening inside.
1:26:13|1:26:32|[Zhang Dan] smiled and said, "[Zhang Dan] ignored [Xiao Bao]'s doubts, turned around and carefully opened the car door to walk out. At that moment, the monitor screen suddenly went blank, the spider lost signal. [Xiao Bao] quickly raised the remote control to search for the signal, but it was of no use."
1:26:32|1:26:46|[Zhang Dan] has a small bag tied around his waist, holding a gun in his right hand as he moves through the bushes and small trees. He cautiously approaches the abandoned building, while [Xiao Bao] opens the car door to check the signal receiver on the roof.
1:27:1|1:27:17|[Xiao Bao] looked at [Ye Hong] with a look of helplessness and confusion in his eyes. By this time, [Zhang Dan] had already climbed up the unfinished building. The entire building was in a state of disrepair, devoid of any vitality, with dangers lurking everywhere. The walls and windows had collapsed, exposing everything inside the building.
1:27:17|1:27:46|[Zhang Dan] entered the room where [King Kong] and his group were. He cautiously peeked his head out, holding a gun in his hands to observe the surroundings. Quickly running in, he hid behind a wall. After confirming it was safe, he rushed into the room with his gun raised. Surprisingly, the room was empty, with only a Russian nesting doll on the table, featuring a portrait of [Zhang Dan]. Perplexed, [Zhang Dan] slowly approached and stared at the nesting doll, lost in thought. Then, he slowly bent down.
1:27:46|1:28:4|He gently opened the nesting dolls, revealing a portrait of [Amber] in the first layer, followed by [Xiao Bao], and the final layer contained [Ye Hong]. Puzzled, he reached for the last layer, only to discover a timed bomb inside.
1:28:4|1:28:10|He was startled, quickly pulled his hand away, slowly stood up, and as the countdown reached zero, [King Kong] appeared.
1:28:31|1:28:46|Xiao Bao was also escorted over by King Kong's men at this time, with Ye Hong standing at the back, silent.
1:29:2|1:29:27|[Zhang Dan] stared fiercely at [King Kong], with a low and fierce look in his eyes. [King Kong] smiled and gestured for his men to push [Amber] and [Xiao Bao] towards [Zhang Dan], then turned to [Ye Hong] and said:
1:29:37|1:29:47|[King Kong] glanced at the strange-looking [Ye Hong], reached out and patted her shoulder, then turned to look at [Zhang Dan], squinting his eyes in a threatening manner, and with his henchmen behind him, he turned and walked downstairs.
1:29:47|1:30:12|Xiao Bao's eyes never left Ye Hong, filled with anger and disappointment. Ye Hong's eyes were moist and dazed, but soon she snapped out of it and pointed a gun at Zhang Dan. King Kong arrived with his men at a dark factory, where he shook hands with an old man with a white beard.
1:31:6|1:31:17|[King Kong] handed the box to him with a mix of belief and doubt. The appraiser next to him took the box. Inside the unfinished building, [Ye Hong] sat on a stool with a gun in hand, crossing her legs.
1:31:46|1:32:0|[Ye Hong] coldly raised the gun and aimed it at [Zhang Dan]. At the same time, Yurick's appraiser opened the box, put on gloves, and gently took out GAIA to examine.
1:32:3|1:32:10|In the distance, a gunshot suddenly rang out, prompting Yuri's men to immediately draw their weapons and point them at [King Kong].
1:32:17|1:32:29|King Kong's subordinates were still wary, holding their guns until Yuri spoke and they finally put them down. King Kong pretended to be relaxed and let them continue, while the appraiser continued to work busily.
1:32:29|1:32:36|Yurick stared at the person opposite him intently. The appraiser looked up and nodded at Yurick, who then instructed his men to proceed with the transaction.
1:32:37|1:32:54|[King Kong] had a big smile on his face, looking smug. He turned his back and stood to the side as one of his men walked up to the table. The appraiser opened the computer and gestured for him to enter the bank account number. The silence was broken by [Zhang Dan]'s voice.
1:32:56|1:33:23|[Zhang Dan] pointed a gun at the back of [Ye Hong]'s head, slowly descending the stairs from the side. A hint of doubt flashed across [King Kong]'s face, then turned into anger. He pulled out a gun from behind and without hesitation, shot [Ye Hong] in the chest. [Ye Hong] fell in front of [Zhang Dan], who immediately squatted down to check the situation. He turned his head in disbelief and said, "His men translated their conversation for Yurik."
1:34:51|1:34:57|[Ye Hong] suddenly stood up and shot down [King Kong]'s weapon.
1:34:58|1:35:23|[Ye Hong] unzipped the jacket and said, "There's a bulletproof vest inside." [King Kong] glared in anger, but was held at gunpoint by [Zhang Dan]. [Zhang Dan] loaded the gun, memories flooding back, memories of the old man with a white beard passing a message to [Zhang Dan] in prison.
1:35:23|1:35:53|He hired the Eastern European guy, stole your Forest Eye, and as the explosion of the police car in his memory sounded, [Zhang Dan]'s thoughts were pulled back to reality. He gritted his teeth fiercely, wishing to shoot [King Kong] dead on the spot. At this moment, [Xiao Bao]'s spider appeared in the corner, pointing a gun at the people inside the house. [Xiao Bao] and [Amber] were hiding in the dark, anxiously controlling the spider's movements.
1:35:53|1:35:58|Another spider also emerged from the shadows, extending a gun barrel from its abdomen.
1:35:58|1:36:5|[Zhang Dan] hesitated for a moment, reached out to lock the safety, and slowly moved the gun away from [King Kong]'s forehead.
1:36:5|1:36:16|[King Kong] stared fiercely at [Zhang Dan], showing no fear. [Zhang Dan] turned to Yuri and said, and Yuri accepted with pleasure.
1:36:16|1:36:28|The old man with a white beard translated his words to [King Kong], and Yurick slowly said, "[King Kong], think about the machine just now."
1:36:28|1:36:37|The lips couldn't help but tremble, [Xiao Bao] was ready to take action.
1:36:41|1:36:48|One of the spiders hanging from the ceiling exploded itself, prompting everyone to pick up weapons and engage in a gunfight.
1:36:48|1:37:15|In the chaos, [Ye Hong] covered [Zhang Dan] and managed to steal the GAIA from the table. This did not escape the eyes of [King Kong], who quickly got up and chased after them with a machine gun. [Zhang Dan] and [Ye Hong] escaped from the gunfire, but to their surprise, [King Kong] caught up with them. He started shooting, forcing the two into a corner.
1:37:18|1:37:26|The two of them hid behind a huge steel plate, with [Zhang Dan] occasionally firing back, but ultimately unable to withstand the machine gun in the hands of [King Kong].
1:37:26|1:37:48|At this moment, [King Kong] was furious and shooting wildly. [Zhang Dan] and [Ye Hong] exchanged a glance, knowing that this stalemate was not the solution. [Zhang Dan] then threw the briefcase containing GAIA out. Seeing this, [King Kong] immediately dropped his gun, grabbed the briefcase, and ran outside. His men brought the car to the entrance as [King Kong] ran while keeping an eye on his back.
1:37:49|1:38:1|After getting on the car, the two cars in front and back immediately fled, with [Amber] and [Xiao Bao] hiding in the corner observing secretly. When they saw [King Kong] and his group escaping, the two quickly pushed open the door and chased after them.
1:38:1|1:38:7|At this moment, [King Kong], who narrowly escaped death and obtained the treasure, showed a smug smile.
1:38:7|1:38:20|He suddenly heard some movement in the box, his face darkened as he opened it and exclaimed, "There's a Matryoshka bomb in the box, showing a distance of nine hundred and ninety-eight meters."
1:38:24|1:38:32|The distance immediately turned into one kilometer. [Zhang Dan] and the other three stood on the overpass, watching the thick smoke from the explosion not far away, sighing.
1:38:42|1:38:48|[Zhang Dan] remained expressionless as he took out GAIA from his pocket and placed it in front of [Xiao Bao].
1:38:50|1:39:0|When they were being chased by King Kong just now, Zhang Dan had already secretly switched GAIA with the bomb.
1:39:14|1:39:33|Without waiting for [Amber] to respond, [Zhang Dan] kissed her, and then the two of them kissed as if no one else was around. [Xiao Bao] stared at them, [Zhang Dan] gave him a wink with eyes wide open, and [Xiao Bao] instantly understood. He looked affectionately at [Ye Hong] and pouted his lips as he leaned in.
1:39:34|1:39:43|Who knew [Ye Hong] would slap [Xiao Bao] and roll her eyes at him, causing [Zhang Dan] to burst out laughing. [Xiao Bao] felt extremely embarrassed and said:
1:39:55|1:40:9|[Zhang Dan]'s words made four people burst into laughter, everyone laughing heartily. The thrilling day came to an end. Everything settled, and the source of all evil, [King Kong], has reaped what he sowed.
1:40:9|1:40:14|[Zhang Dan] and his girlfriend [Amber] have also resolved their misunderstandings of many years and reconciled.
1:40:14|1:40:31|At this moment, [Pierre] was enjoying the morning sun at home, holding a newspaper in his hand. A piece of news caught his eye, with the headline: "GAIA returned to its original owner, donor's identity in question." [Pierre] smiled approvingly and nodded.
1:40:31|1:40:36|There was a sudden knock on the door, and [Pierre] quickly placed the newspaper on the coffee table and got up to answer it.
1:40:39|1:40:41|The delivery man greeted [Pierre] with a "good morning" and handed him a paper box.
1:40:41|1:41:6|[Pierre] thanked as he took the paper box and then slowly opened it with a small knife. He looked inside and couldn't help but freeze for a moment. He took out a delicate box from it, a smile hidden in his eyes. Opening the lid, he saw a pair of Baoding balls engraved with dragon patterns. He took out the Baoding balls and played with them, showing his deep affection.
1:41:6|1:41:16|[Zhang Dan] drove a luxury sports car through the fields, with [Amber] sitting beside him. [Amber] ran her fingers through her wind-blown hair, cheering happily.
1:41:16|1:41:29|In the back row, [Xiao Bao] wearing sunglasses, coolly follows the rhythm of the music, while [Ye Hong] excitedly opens her arms with a lollipop in her mouth. The four of them laugh heartily, exuding an air of winners in life.
1:41:29|1:41:37|The film is about to say goodbye to you here. Thank you for listening. Now let me tell you about the post-credits scene.
1:41:37|1:41:46|By the side of the road in the wilderness, [Zhang Dan] and [Xiao Bao] are standing under a tree relieving themselves, while [Ye Hong] is standing not far away, using [Xiao Bao]'s urination device.
