0:2:20|0:2:27|After filming, Wu Fuchun sat across from Jing Ruyi, looking at her.
0:3:10|0:3:21|[Jing Ruyi] glanced disdainfully at [Wu Fuchun], ignoring his outstretched hand. Seeing this, [Wu Fuchun] awkwardly withdrew his hand, leaning back in his chair, staring thoughtfully at [Jing Ruyi].
0:3:55|0:3:59|[Wu Fuchun] smugly looked at [Jing Ruyi], then followed her gaze to the window.
0:4:1|0:4:9|[Wu Fuchun] quickly took out a DSLR camera from his bag and started snapping away at the penguins outside the window.
0:4:35|0:4:42|At this moment, a thick fog rolled in, reducing visibility. The control tower called out to the pilots, warning them of a massive cyclone forming ahead.
0:5:4|0:5:8|The plane jolted heavily again, and [Wu Fuchun] immediately dropped the camera, hurriedly fastening the seat belt in a panic.
0:5:8|0:5:13|The plane slowly entered a dark cloud layer, with a dense black mass inside the cloud, occasionally lit up by flashes of lightning.
0:5:31|0:5:39|[Jing Ruyi] and Natasha ignored him, holding each other's hands tightly. Seeing this, [Wu Fuchun] became even more anxious, tightening the seat belt as much as possible. At this moment, the control tower issued another warning.
0:5:42|0:5:50|The pilot flew the plane past lightning, with very low visibility in the foggy clouds, relying solely on experience to continue flying forward.
0:5:50|0:6:1|[Wu Fuchun] looked out the window with a gloomy expression, almost on the verge of tears. It wasn't until the plane narrowly avoided a mountain peak that there was time to resume contact with the control tower. At this moment
0:6:1|0:6:8|The plane has encountered severe icing and needs to make an emergency landing. The cockpit instruments are flashing uncontrollably, causing [Wu Fuchun] to panic.
0:6:10|0:6:21|The pilot tried his best to control the plane, but couldn't prevent it from shaking. The luggage compartments were shaking more and more violently, and suddenly the plane seemed to be suspended in mid-air as if someone had pressed the pause button.
0:6:21|0:6:39|Natasha then fell uncontrollably, like a withered leaf being blown away by the wind. At this moment, Wu Fuchun and [Jing Ruyi] screamed in confusion, while [Jing Ruyi] grabbed onto the handrail, closed her eyes tightly, her face pale. The plane continued to flip uncontrollably, making everyone extremely uncomfortable.
0:6:39|0:6:45|The boxes on the luggage rack also fell down one after another, scattering the items inside all over the cabin.
0:6:45|0:6:50|Even more deadly, a thermos flew up and smashed onto the pilot's head.
0:6:50|0:6:58|The pilot crashed stiffly onto the control stick, and the plane headed straight towards the mountain ahead, scraping its belly as it surged up between the mountains.
0:6:58|0:7:10|The left engine hit a rock, instantly igniting a fire. The propeller, due to inertia, swung back again and directly stirred into the cabin. The rapidly rotating propeller blade brushed against the hem of [Jing Ruyi]'s clothes.
0:7:10|0:7:19|In an instant, her glasses were shattered, causing a loss of pressure in the cabin and a large number of items to fly out, including the crucial latitude and longitude detector.
0:7:19|0:7:28|The plane is now completely out of control, intentionally skimming the mountainside and sliding down, flipping and crashing repeatedly, with the pilot and seat scraped out.
0:7:28|0:7:37|After skimming over the mountain, the plane did not stop, but continued to dive forward along its inertia, crashing headfirst onto the ice.
0:7:39|0:7:48|At this moment, the three people in the cabin are unconscious, their fate unknown. The film begins with this plane crash.
0:7:52|0:8:5|After an unknown period of time, [Wu Fuchun] finally opened his eyes. His mind was still spinning, and for a moment he couldn't figure out where he was. He could see half of his head buried in the snow.
0:8:5|0:8:9|After a moment of daze, [Wu Fuchun] finally rolled his eyes and struggled to get up.
0:8:9|0:8:16|Originally, [Wu Fuchun] was knocked down with a chair in a snowy field, and he quickly unfastened the safety buckle around his waist.
0:8:16|0:8:27|Wu Fuchun fell off the chair, blinked hard to try to wake himself up, then stood up. At this moment, there was nothing else except for vast glaciers and chairs.
0:8:27|0:8:38|He took a few weak steps, clutching his neck, before collapsing on the ground. His eyes were unfocused as he turned his head slightly and was stunned by the sight on the other side.
0:8:38|0:8:53|Only to see the wreckage of the plane everywhere, scattered all over the ground, the tail of the plane was lifted up under the huge impact. Only the cabin barely remained intact. [Wu Fuchun] looked fearfully at everything in front of him, a little hesitant to face it.
0:8:53|0:9:4|Suddenly he panicked, touching his face, then looking at his hands to make sure they were intact before nervously [Wu Fuchun] pinched his thighs, calves, and knees.
0:9:4|0:9:12|After confirming that he was not injured, the sudden noise made [Wu Fuchun] look back at the wreckage of the plane.
0:9:13|0:9:24|He welled up with tears in an instant, pacing aimlessly in place. At this moment, [Jing Ruyi] was still lying in the cabin of the plane, her head hitting a cabinet.
0:9:24|0:9:35|Blood kept flowing down her forehead, and after a while she slowly opened her eyes. Suddenly, she felt liquid dripping from above her head, so she sluggishly lifted her head.
0:9:35|0:9:46|Natascha, sitting next to her, was hanging upside down with blood continuously flowing from her mouth. [Jing Ruyi] was too preoccupied to care about Natascha at the moment, wiping the blood off her face.
0:9:46|0:9:57|Struggling to sit up with her upper body, she found it difficult to free her legs as there was a huge steel plate pressing down on her lower leg.
0:9:57|0:10:4|[Jing Ruyi] pushed the steel plate on her leg with anger and frustration, but even with all her strength, she couldn't move the plate an inch.
0:10:5|0:10:21|At this moment, Natasha finally regained consciousness, furrowing her brow and opening her eyes. [Jing Ruyi] frantically tapped on the airplane window to seek help, and [Wu Fuchun] rushed into the cabin upon hearing the noise, only to be shocked by the scene before him.
0:10:22|0:10:28|[Wu Fuchun] carefully looked at the position of the iron plate on the ground, then glanced at the weakly breathing Natasha.
0:10:30|0:10:40|[Wu Fuchun] trembled as he nodded, taking the lead in lifting Natasha and trying to get her off the overturned seat. What he didn't see was a piece of metal had already pierced Natasha.
0:10:40|0:10:51|[Wu Fuchun] unbuckled Natasha's seatbelt, carried her out of the cabin, while [Jing Ruyi] was pinned under a piece of metal, unable to move, watching helplessly as [Wu Fuchun] and Natasha left the cabin.
0:10:51|0:10:57|At this moment, Wu Fuchun is experiencing a mix of emotions, with each passing second feeling like a torment to her.
0:10:58|0:11:5|After settling Natasha down, [Wu Fuchun] quickly returned to the cabin, giving [Jing Ruyi] a renewed sense of hope for survival.
0:11:14|0:11:30|The sudden turbulence of the plane caused [Wu Fuchun] to fall down. By now, the ice had already cracked open, and the cabin was rapidly sinking, allowing seawater to rush in. Seeing this, [Wu Fuchun] quickly picked up the backpack and prepared to rush outwards.
0:11:30|0:11:43|He glanced apologetically at [Jing Ruyi], then rushed out without looking back. Facing the desertion of his teammates, [Jing Ruyi] felt both pain and despair as the seawater continued to spread upwards.
0:11:43|0:11:55|[Jing Ruyi] could only sit up straight, trying her best to lift the steel plate on her leg. As self-rescue proved futile, [Jing Ruyi] finally burst into tears. Suddenly, [Wu Fuchun] appeared at the cabin door.
0:11:55|0:12:4|He clung to the door frame of the cabin, watching as [Jing Ruyi] cried and struggled to lift the steel plate. When [Jing Ruyi] saw [Wu Fuchun], a hint of pleading smile appeared on her face.
0:12:4|0:12:14|Little did [Wu Fuchun] know, her gaze was actually fixed on the black suitcase behind her. She grabbed a fire extinguisher and placed it under the steel plate, then forcefully pulled up [Jing Ruyi]'s upper body.
0:12:18|0:12:25|[Wu Fuchun] quickly dropped [Jing Ruyi] and knelt in front of the steel plate, trying to pull out her foot, but the non-slip boot was firmly stuck under the steel plate.
0:12:25|0:12:28|It is impossible to retrieve it with the strength of the two.
0:12:28|0:12:35|[Wu Fuchun] could only pull [Jing Ruyi]'s foot out of the shoe, grabbing her arm and dragging her out with all his might.
0:12:35|0:12:39|The two people escaped from the cabin, but the 10-meter ice couldn't support them anymore.
0:12:39|0:12:46|The wreckage of the plane slowly sank in front of them, in the chaos [Wu Fuchun] fell to the ground but dared not to pause for a moment.
0:12:46|0:12:52|Dragging [Jing Ruyi]'s clothes, [Wu Fuchun] climbed further away, while [Wu Fuchun] moved backwards using both hands and feet.
0:12:52|0:12:59|He didn't stop until he felt safe, and soon the plane disappeared completely into the ice hole.
0:12:59|0:13:4|Now there were only the three of them on the ice, with [Wu Fuchun] and [Jing Ruyi] gazing at everything before them.
0:13:4|0:13:16|Wu Fuchun, who was the first to regain his strength, couldn't calm down for a long time. He propped up his feet and held up his phone to search for a signal everywhere, while Jing Ruyi sat beside Natasha, reaching out to touch her carotid artery.
0:13:16|0:13:24|After a while, [Jing Ruyi] slowly withdrew her hand, and [Wu Fuchun] looked at the phone with "No Service" displayed in the top left corner, his brows furrowed in silence.
0:13:24|0:13:34|[Jing Ruyi] covered Natasha's eyes with her hands, tears streaming down uncontrollably. [Wu Fuchun] squatted silently in front of [Jing Ruyi], not saying a word for a long time.
0:13:34|0:13:41|After giving [Jing Ruyi] some time to calm down, Wu Fuchun couldn't hold back any longer and took a few steps forward.
0:13:43|0:13:49|[Jing Ruyi] sat on the side absentmindedly, as if not hearing a word of what [Wu Fuchun] was saying.
0:13:59|0:14:4|[Wu Fuchun] furrowed his brow in thought, then lifted his head to look at [Jing Ruyi].
0:14:4|0:14:12|[Jing Ruyi] raised her wrist to check the time, only to find that her watch face had been shattered.
0:14:25|0:14:30|The confident words of the high-altitude physicist hit [Wu Fuchun] like a hammer to the chest.
0:14:30|0:14:36|He sat weakly on the ice, looking around at the vast white glaciers in silence.
0:14:36|0:14:44|Wu Fuchun quickly picked himself up and began to reorganize the remaining supplies.
0:14:50|0:15:2|[Jing Ruyi] ignores [Wu Fuchun], she picks up a handful of snow and applies it to her wound. [Wu Fuchun] looks disdainfully at [Jing Ruyi], continues to consolidate the resources around him, and empties the suitcase.
0:15:2|0:15:8|Have [Jing Ruyi] sit down and watch Natasha's body without moving.
0:15:14|0:15:23|[Jing Ruyi] lowered her head to look at the body next to her, then turned to [Wu Fuchun] imploringly, the only male currently with a sound and pain-free body.
0:15:23|0:15:29|The tycoon [Wu Fuchun] deservedly turned into a laborer, tying one end of the rope to the suitcase.
0:15:29|0:15:50|On the other end, dragging it laboriously forward with it over the shoulder, one side of the suitcase contained Natasha's body, while the other side held the injured [Jing Ruyi]. [Jing Ruyi] clutched onto the remaining supplies, as [Wu Fuchun] stopped in his tracks, looking around in confusion.
0:15:58|0:16:9|[Wu Fuchun] looked around in confusion, then obediently picked up the rope and walked forward with determination. Soon they arrived at a wide ridge that they needed to climb over.
0:16:9|0:16:16|It will take a long time, and the weather here has become very harsh.
0:16:34|0:16:41|Ruyi hurriedly took out a pickaxe from her backpack and threw it to [Wu Fuchun], who then desperately started digging up the ground.
0:16:45|0:16:48|[Wu Fuchun] looks ferocious, never daring to stop for a moment.
0:16:48|0:16:53|And not far away, heavy snow mixed with a storm, roaring towards them like the end of the world.
0:16:53|0:17:3|Ruyi struggled out of the suitcase and crawled towards [Wu Fuchun]. The snowstorm grew stronger, and soon a layer of frost formed on Natasha's face.
0:17:3|0:17:10|[Wu Fuchun] frantically dug through the snow, quickly uncovering a hole half a meter deep, while Ruyi lay on the other side of the snow pit.
0:17:10|0:17:15|Continuously pushing the snow out, the storm is getting closer and closer, pressing down overwhelmingly.
0:17:15|0:17:21|At the critical moment, they finally dug a snow pit big enough for two people to squeeze into.
0:17:21|0:17:31|Natascha's body and backpack were left outside the pit, and the fierce blizzard kept sweeping over her. The sky above Antarctica was gloomy at this moment.
0:17:31|0:17:38|The sky was covered with gray murky clouds, and the storm raged over the glacier like sharp swords.
0:17:38|0:17:46|Finally, the snow stopped, and through the crack in the luggage compartment, the sky was gradually getting brighter, and the howling wind disappeared.
0:17:46|0:17:57|The two in the pit were close together, with [Jing Ruyi] slowly opening her eyes. [Wu Fuchun], on the other hand, was sleeping soundly leaning against [Jing Ruyi], seeming to sense the movement beside him, frowning.
0:17:57|0:18:5|Opening his eyes, he shook his head and looked at [Jing Ruyi] beside him with confusion, clearly not fully awake.
0:18:6|0:18:14|[Wu Fuchun] raised his arm and pushed the corner of the overhead luggage compartment with force, the sudden light surrounded [Jing Ruyi] who couldn't open her eyes.
0:18:22|0:18:30|[Jing Ruyi] looked at [Wu Fuchun] as if he were an idiot, then lowered her head to examine her own calf.
0:18:47|0:18:51|[Jing Ruyi]'s eyes were filled with suppressed resentment.
0:19:4|0:19:13|Wu Fuchun then vented his frustration by pushing the suitcase aside, and struggled to climb out of the snow pit. He picked up his handbag and walked forward without looking back.
0:19:17|0:19:22|Without the burden of Natasha and [Jing Ruyi], [Wu Fuchun] quickly reached the top of the ridge.
0:19:22|0:19:28|From a distance, the yellow fur moved slowly, like a proud rooster.
0:19:28|0:19:35|He first walked slowly on a snowy slope, then suddenly, with a burst of energy from who knows where, he started running.
0:19:35|0:19:46|[Wu Fuchun] ran and climbed to the top of the mountain, then continued walking along this line. Upon reaching the final vantage point, [Wu Fuchun] threw the handbag up there.
0:19:46|0:19:58|Then [Wu Fuchun] used both hands and feet to climb up the rocks. Obviously, this wealthy young man is not a fan of sports, but he managed to climb up here out of sheer survival instinct and unwillingness to give up, standing at the highest point of the mountain ridge.
0:19:58|0:20:0|He staggered forward for several steps.
0:20:0|0:20:11|[Wu Fuchun] gritted his teeth, quickly pulled out his phone from his pocket, and raised it high again, trying to find a signal, which was his last glimmer of hope in his eyes.
0:20:11|0:20:22|On the other side, the sound of birds caught [Jing Ruyi], who was still in the snow pit, off guard. She seemed to have realized something, her expression changing from initial surprise to undisguised fear.
0:20:22|0:20:34|[Jing Ruyi] cautiously peeks out half of her head, only to see a group of Antarctic skuas feasting voraciously on Natasha's body. [Jing Ruyi] looks ahead in disbelief, unsure of how to shift her gaze away.
0:20:34|0:20:46|At this moment, [Wu Fuchun] is still standing at the highest point of the mountain ridge, holding up his phone to search for a signal. [Wu Fuchun] looks at the screen in frustration, and eventually his hand helplessly drops down.
0:20:52|0:21:4|[Wu Fuchun] was so angry that he picked up a stone and threw it into the distance. However, he exerted too much force, slipped under his feet, and rolled down the hillside. He quickly grabbed onto the snow to stop himself.
0:21:4|0:21:14|Exhausted, Wu Fuchun finally managed to stop himself. He lay motionless on the ground, using all his strength to barely prop up his upper body with his arms.
0:21:14|0:21:37|The first thing that [Wu Fuchun] did was to search for the fallen phone. He hurried to the phone and was about to pick it up, but coincidentally saw something exciting. Below the snow slope stood a small wooden house covered with snow. On the other side, more and more seagulls came to search for food. [Jing Ruyi] tightly hugged a thermos cup, curled up in a snow pit, and closed her eyes tightly.
0:21:37|0:21:44|Trembling in fear, the agile seagull followed the sound and mercilessly pecked at [Jing Ruyi] when it saw her.
0:21:44|0:21:55|Ruyi waved the thermos cup in fear, but couldn't drive it away. Suddenly, a hand accurately grabbed the seagull by the neck and threw it far away. After driving away the seagull, [Wu Fuchun] appeared.
0:22:0|0:22:8|[Wu Fuchun] emptied everything from his backpack onto the ground, picked up a pair of sunglasses and put them in his pocket, then casually picked up a piece of underwear.
0:22:8|0:22:17|After identifying what it was, [Wu Fuchun] impatiently threw it to the ground, then stuffed the thermos into the other side of the backpack and tucked a stack of dollars into her fur pocket.
0:22:17|0:22:28|After finishing all this, he threw the iron pickaxe at his feet and walked forward. [Wu Fuchun] walked up to Natasha, knelt down slowly in front of her, frowned, and finally reached out his hand.
0:22:28|0:22:31|Took off Natasha's knitted hat.
0:22:31|0:22:41|Ruyi didn't say anything after seeing this scene, just lowered her head sadly. [Wu Fuchun] put the hat on his own head and started shoveling snow onto Natasha.
0:22:41|0:22:44|A tomb made of snow was quickly built.
0:22:47|0:22:58|Ruyi still sat in place, lowering her head in confusion. Soon, the two of them set off again, with [Wu Fuchun] carrying the injured Ruyi towards the small wooden house that represented their last hope.
0:22:58|0:23:6|They walked on the plain at times, and climbed up the hill at other times. The snow in Antarctica was deep up to their calves, and [Wu Fuchun] found it very difficult to take each step.
0:23:15|0:23:23|Ruyi's leg kept rubbing against the bloody surface, while [Wu Fuchun] carried her on his back, climbing up the rocks with great effort.
0:23:24|0:23:33|[Wu Fuchun] took a deep breath, then dragged [Jing Ruyi] up a bit. Exhausted, [Wu Fuchun] collapsed at the top of the slope, with [Jing Ruyi] falling to the side.
0:23:45|0:23:51|Confronted with the paralyzed [Jing Ruyi], [Wu Fuchun] immediately lifted her onto his shoulders without hesitation.
0:23:51|0:24:2|He staggered forward two steps, then his knees gave way and he tumbled down with [Jing Ruyi]. The snow slope was long, with no cover around, and the two of them rolled for a long time before coming to a stop.
0:24:2|0:24:10|[Wu Fuchun], stabilizing his body, immediately crawled towards [Jing Ruyi] in front, while [Jing Ruyi], under the dual torment of physical pain and mental anguish, eventually passed out.
0:24:12|0:24:22|After an unknown period of time, [Jing Ruyi] finally opened her eyes, only to see the dim wooden furniture in front of her. She saw [Wu Fuchun] leaning on the wooden table beside her.
0:24:25|0:24:37|Upon hearing the knocking, [Wu Fuchun] opened his eyes to find that [Jing Ruyi] had already woken up. [Wu Fuchun] hurried to [Jing Ruyi]'s bedside, while [Jing Ruyi] struggled to prop up half of her body with tears of pain in her eyes.
0:25:2|0:25:14|[Jing Ruyi] looked at [Wu Fuchun] with tears in her eyes, calmly. [Wu Fuchun] stood with his hands crossed in front of his chest, not saying a word. In the end, [Wu Fuchun] took on this heavy responsibility, steadying [Jing Ruyi]'s foot with one hand.
0:25:14|0:25:21|Wu Fuchun carefully unzipped the zipper on her pants leg, but every move brought pain to Jing Ruyi.
0:25:22|0:25:28|Suddenly, [Jing Ruyi] grabbed [Wu Fuchun]'s arm.
0:25:31|0:25:37|[Wu Fuchun] nodded in silence for a moment, then turned and walked towards the door to wait.
0:25:38|0:25:44|[Wu Fuchun] stopped in his tracks, turned around in astonishment, only to see [Jing Ruyi] with tears streaming down her face.
0:25:44|0:25:53|[Jing Ruyi] is currently trampling on her self-esteem, unable to lift her head in sadness, while [Wu Fuchun] purses his lips, showing sympathy tinged with a hint of heartache.
0:25:53|0:25:56|He folded back and sat next to [Jing Ruyi].
0:25:56|0:26:7|As Wu Fuchun reached out his hand, Jing Ruyi quickly grabbed the blanket beside him and covered his lower body. He felt embarrassed, sniffled, and tremblingly reached his hand into the blanket.
0:26:7|0:26:14|Unbuckling his belt, [Wu Fuchun] pursed his lips and looked expressionlessly to the side, preserving [Jing Ruyi]'s last trace of dignity.
0:26:15|0:26:24|Shortly after, [Jing Ruyi] tearfully untied the belt around her waist, pulled down her pants from her hips, but once the pants reached her thighs, she couldn't exert any more force.
0:26:24|0:26:35|[Wu Fuchun] awkwardly reaches into the blanket, finds the waistband of the pants, and slowly pulls them down. As [Wu Fuchun] moves, [Jing Ruyi] tightly grips the blanket with both hands.
0:26:35|0:26:42|Tears of pain streamed down as a large, purplish-black swelling on the middle of the left calf was visible, a sight that was truly shocking.
0:26:43|0:26:51|[Jing Ruyi] gritted her teeth and nodded, while [Wu Fuchun] placed one hand on her knee and the other hand on her leg, slowly bending it to the left.
0:26:51|0:27:0|[Wu Fuchun] glanced at [Jing Ruyi], not daring to stop for a moment. The immense pain made [Jing Ruyi] unable to hold on any longer, and she fainted directly.
0:27:4|0:27:25|Fuchun was at a loss for a moment, standing by the bed not knowing what to do. Outside, the cold wind continued to blow fiercely, and snowflakes blew into the wooden house through the cracks in the ice wall day and night. Exhausted, Fuchun lay on the upper bunk, pursing his lips unwilling to wake up. He furrowed his brow, squinted his eyes, turned over in confusion, and looked towards Jing Ruyi on the lower bunk.
0:27:25|0:27:33|[Jing Ruyi], with a helpless look on her face, furrowed her brow and remained silent, holding a blanket.
0:27:33|0:27:40|Fuchun lay on the edge of the bed for a while without any response, impatiently lay back, and [Jing Ruyi] knocked on the floor again.
0:27:49|0:27:59|After saying this, she dared not look at Fuchun again. Then Fuchun sawed a big hole in the bed board, while [Jing Ruyi] curled up in the corner of the lower bunk.
0:27:59|0:28:10|Her head weakly rested on the edge of the bed, her heart already as lifeless as ashes. Soon, Wu Fuchun chiseled a large hole in the bed board, placed a copper basin under the hole, and then walked away.
0:28:11|0:28:21|After everything was done, Wu Fuchun walked to the door without looking back. Jing Ruyi remained motionless, only the shadow of her profile silently expressing the torment in her heart.
0:28:21|0:28:28|Outside the door, the snowstorm continued, Wu Fuchun opened the wooden door and walked out wearing only a down jacket.
0:28:28|0:28:34|Wu Fuchun then staggered down the steps in the wind and snow, shivering with arms crossed.
0:28:34|0:28:47|He looked around for a target, and suddenly his gaze was caught by a yellow oil tank. He bent down and pondered for a while, then squatted in front of the oil tank, carefully wiping the scale in front of him.
0:28:47|0:28:54|Upon realizing what it was, [Wu Fuchun] immediately rushed towards the cabinet in the corner where a generator was placed.
0:28:54|0:29:5|[Wu Fuchun] opened the cabinet door and pressed the red button on the left, then he searched around the generator for something. Upon seeing the pull cord on the right, [Wu Fuchun] grabbed it without hesitation and began to pull with all his strength.
0:29:8|0:29:20|At this moment, [Jing Ruyi] sat on the bed, dealing with her need to relieve herself with shame and despair. Suddenly, the chandelier above the table emitted a dim yellow light, and the electric heater in the center of the room also lit up.
0:29:20|0:29:32|[Jing Ruyi] couldn't help but look up, staring fixedly at the glowing electric heater in front of her. Outside, it was still a world of ice and snow, a place of despair, while this room was like a faint flicker of flame.
0:29:47|0:29:59|[Wu Fuchun] flipped through the items on the shelf and reported them to [Jing Ruyi], while [Jing Ruyi] carefully recorded the information of these items in her notebook.
0:30:23|0:30:30|[Jing Ruyi] frowned, looking at the can thrown on the bed, then picked it up and examined it carefully.
0:31:44|0:31:53|[Wu Fuchun] couldn't calm the anger in his heart. He stood up and walked to the window, hands on his hips, looking outside with an unprecedented determination in his eyes.
0:31:55|0:32:3|[Jing Ruyi] took out a marker pen and began writing down all the known information on a poster hanging on the wall.
0:32:3|0:32:11|She first listed the numbers 1 to 75 and drew simple directional coordinates.
0:32:11|0:32:16|[Jing Ruyi] stared at the information on the poster and crossed out the numbers 1 to 3 with a red pen.
0:32:31|0:32:35|The diesel generator was working methodically.
0:32:35|0:32:46|This is an important device for the two to survive. The room is gradually warming up, and the electric heater has been moved closer to the bed. [Wu Fuchun] is sleeping unattractively on the upper bunk.
0:32:48|0:32:59|While [Jing Ruyi] on the lower bunk kept her eyes wide open, [Wu Fuchun] soon put on [Jing Ruyi]'s ski suit and started preparing for departure. He poured the clear porridge into an aluminum lunch box and a thermos cup respectively.
0:32:59|0:33:11|[Jing Ruyi] was still sitting on the lower bunk, earnestly drawing on a poster. [Wu Fuchun] picked up the pot of porridge, tilted his head back and drank every drop of the clear porridge inside. Then he carefully inspected the lunch box and thermos.
0:33:11|0:33:24|He glanced at [Jing Ruyi] again, and when he confirmed that [Jing Ruyi] was not looking in this direction, he quietly poured some clear porridge from the lunch box into the thermos. [Jing Ruyi] did not notice [Wu Fuchun]'s little move.
0:33:24|0:33:29|Wu Fuchun handed the lunch box to Jing Ruyi while still looking at the poster attentively.
0:33:30|0:33:38|[Wu Fuchun] immediately started to search through various pockets, and sure enough, he pulled out a few candies from the left pocket and handed them to [Jing Ruyi].
0:33:46|0:33:50|[Wu Fuchun] put the candy back into his pocket, then took down his fur coat from the upper bunk.
0:33:56|0:34:3|[Wu Fuchun] stuffed the thermos cup containing porridge into the side pocket of the backpack, and then put on a knitted hat on his head.
0:35:36|0:35:42|[Jing Ruyi] points in the completely opposite direction of [Wu Fuchun]'s line of sight.
0:35:44|0:35:49|[Jing Ruyi] sat silently on the lower bunk, but still lifted his head to see him off.
0:35:49|0:35:58|[Wu Fuchun] pushed open the door and walked out, but he was confused by the scene in front of him, so he helplessly walked in a circle.
0:36:0|0:36:12|[Wu Fuchun] stood at the door muttering to himself, shouted towards the wooden house, then turned around helplessly. He looked around and finally tentatively chose a direction, gritted his teeth and walked forward.
0:36:46|0:36:57|The tiny [Wu Fuchun] moved slowly on the vast snowy plain for nearly 10 hours, while [Jing Ruyi] who stayed in the cabin carefully circled the number 4 in red on the lower bunk.
0:37:30|0:37:41|Every day's journey consumes a great deal of energy for [Wu Fuchun]. Usually, after returning, he falls into a deep sleep, and in the blink of an eye, the numbers 5 and 6 on the poster are also crossed out.
0:37:41|0:37:51|Day after day, [Wu Fuchun] remained away for a long time, while the two of them searched for their last hope. Occasionally, he would also come across some interesting little things.
0:37:51|0:37:58|The seal looked confused, tilting its head to one side.
0:37:59|0:38:6|The little seal glanced at [Wu Fuchun], then lazily lay down on the ground.
0:38:6|0:38:12|[Wu Fuchun] helplessly waved his hand and continued to walk forward, soon arriving at a glacier.
0:38:12|0:38:32|Here not only is there a vast expanse of sea, but also adorable and simple penguins standing in groups of three or four. [Wu Fuchun] is crawling on the ground, taking out his phone to take a close-up photo with himself and the penguins, then joining their group. He opens his arms and kneels on the ground, imitating the penguins as he waddles forward.
0:38:32|0:38:40|At this moment, he seemed to have forgotten the predicament he was in, standing at the top of a slope and throwing his backpack directly down.
0:38:40|0:38:46|At the same time, [Wu Fuchun] also opened his arms and lay on the ground, sliding down the snow slope, having a great time.
0:38:46|0:38:57|Perhaps this was the happiest day for him since he set foot on Antarctica. After sliding to the bottom of the slope, [Wu Fuchun] lay in the snow, reluctant to leave, enjoying this rare moment of tranquility.
0:39:3|0:39:9|Wu Fuchun, with a scruffy beard, wearing sunglasses, squats on the ground, staring at the seagulls in front of him.
0:39:19|0:39:28|Suddenly, a loud noise in the distance, the seabirds flew away at the sound. [Wu Fuchun] alertly raised his head, only to see a large glacier suddenly cracking open.
0:39:28|0:39:37|He went straight towards the ice where he was, hurriedly stood up, grabbed his backpack and ran forward. The rolling ice blocks quickly caught up with [Wu Fuchun].
0:39:37|0:39:45|Poor [Wu Fuchun] was running for his life while trying to pull up his pants in a hurry. He couldn't help but glance back, so scared that he couldn't even hold onto the cigar in his mouth.
0:39:45|0:39:56|The avalanche behind him was powerful, he grabbed his belt with one hand and his backpack with the other. Just as he ran to a huge rock, he was swept down by the avalanche along with his backpack.
0:39:56|0:40:2|He could only cower behind the giant rock, trembling in fear, praying to safely survive this disaster.
0:40:23|0:40:40|Ten days passed quickly. [Wu Fuchun] walked towards the window while chewing on a can of food. The scene outside the window made his face turn serious - the sky was filled with howling winds and snow, with extremely low visibility.
0:40:52|0:40:58|[Wu Fuchun] helplessly sealed the can, frowning as he looked at [Jing Ruyi].
0:41:0|0:41:12|[Wu Fuchun] sat in front of the wooden table, staring at the drawings and writings on the poster of [Jing Ruyi]. [Jing Ruyi] turned around and looked quietly at [Wu Fuchun], with a hint of grievance and sadness in her eyes. [Wu Fuchun] dared not face such a gaze.
0:41:20|0:41:27|[Wu Fuchun] walked over in three or two steps, knelt beside the lower bunk, took the pen from [Jing Ruyi]'s hand, and reached over her body.
0:41:27|0:41:33|An arrow was drawn towards the east of the seal, and [Jing Ruyi] watched his movements intently.
0:41:50|0:41:59|[Jing Ruyi] uncovered the blanket and looked at her left leg, which had been set askew, speechless for a long time, and the number on the poster had already reached fifteen.
0:41:59|0:42:16|On that day, [Wu Fuchun] went as usual to search for the supply station. He climbed up the last hill in the direction he had previously locked onto, only to see the vast sea and endless glaciers in front of him. Looking down, he saw a desolate and uninhabited area with not a single soul in sight.
0:42:16|0:42:25|He took out a thermos cup from his backpack, carefully poured some porridge onto the lid, tilted his head back and poured it into his mouth. This was his two days' ration.
0:42:25|0:42:37|After filling his stomach with a simple meal, [Wu Fuchun] took out a notebook and a pen. His fingers were already frozen in the cold weather as he carefully drew the detailed location where he was currently at in the notebook.
0:42:37|0:42:46|After finishing the recording, [Wu Fuchun] wiped his nose, subconsciously looked around, and below the mountain hollow, he saw a human skeleton.
0:43:12|0:43:19|[Jing Ruyi] took a sip with a skeptical look.
0:43:32|0:43:37|The strong fishy smell of the thief's soup forced [Wu Fuchun] to vomit all the bones and soup.
0:43:37|0:43:45|It has been 17 days so far.
0:43:59|0:44:8|He walked up to [Jing Ruyi] and gently grabbed her calf, placing it softly on the bed.
0:44:26|0:44:34|[Wu Fuchun] sneered at [Jing Ruyi], covered her with a blanket, and another day passed. [Jing Ruyi] drew a red circle on 18.
0:46:7|0:46:37|[Wu Fuchun] set off again, this time throwing his backpack to the side, sticking his butt up and lying on the ice. He then took out a fishing rod, attached a piece of bait, carefully extended the rod, and cast it into the ice hole. As time passed, [Wu Fuchun] changed his posture from sitting to lying down, resting his head on the backpack, looking helplessly at the sky, tightly holding the fishing rod in his hand. Suddenly, the fishing rod moved, and the pulling sensation became more and more obvious.
0:46:37|0:46:49|[Wu Fuchun] knelt on the ground, desperately pulling up a fish of two or three decimeters from the ice hole in Weixian County. [Wu Fuchun] ecstatically pounced on it, holding the fish and examining it non-stop.
0:46:51|0:46:58|[Wu Fuchun] caught a slippery sea fish, the smile on his face couldn't be hidden, and soon he returned with a full load.
0:46:58|0:47:4|Suddenly there was a loud noise around him, and soon his smile froze on his face. 
0:47:4|0:47:9|Suddenly, a two-meter-wide crack opened up beneath him, and he fell down without any warning.
0:47:9|0:47:16|[Wu Fuchun] kept sinking, he clumsily crashed into the rocks, and finally fell heavily onto a platform.
0:47:16|0:47:29|[Wu Fuchun] lay on the snow on his side, completely unconscious. The snow slowly slid down his temple, and on the other side of the platform was a bottomless abyss, just like what he was facing now, with no end in sight.
0:47:29|0:47:40|After an unknown period of time, [Wu Fuchun] finally regained some consciousness. His eyelids trembled slightly, then suddenly shook violently as if in a nightmare. Finally, [Wu Fuchun] woke up.
0:47:40|0:47:46|He tried to prop himself up and stand up, causing the accumulated snow on his body to shake off with his movements.
0:47:46|0:48:7|It is obvious that he has been unconscious for a long time. He found himself sitting on the ground in front of a deep cliff, scared. After a while, he realized that the platform he was on was at least a dozen meters away from the ground where he fell. But [Wu Fuchun] did not give up completely. He gritted his teeth, stood up, and looked around for a way out.
0:48:7|0:48:17|The platform was not large. [Wu Fuchun] easily found the only passage, but his previous injury had not healed. He could only limp in, hugging his body.
0:48:17|0:48:47|In the crevice, every step is unknown. The passage he is in can only accommodate one person at a time, and beyond the passage is a wide platform. Without hesitation, [Wu Fuchun] continues forward to the next passage, moving through it with both hands and feet. He is shocked by the sight before him, finding himself in a hollow area with an extension of a platform of only 10 square meters at the mouth of the cave, resembling the cold and eerie atmosphere of the Spider Cave in Journey to the West.
0:48:47|0:48:54|This is an unknown space that he has never encountered before, in front of him is a natural glacial cave.
0:48:54|0:49:5|[Wu Fuchun] trembled forward two steps, stood at the edge, mustered up the courage to look down at the abyss below, so dark that the camera couldn't capture it.
0:49:5|0:49:28|The external world is still in a snowstorm, and the wooden house appears particularly small on the vast Antarctic wilderness. [Jing Ruyi] wrapped in fur shivered and lay on the bed watching the electric heater in the study, which she never turned on when alone. At this moment, [Wu Fuchun] walked deeper and deeper, and the light became darker. He squeezed through a strange hollow with his body tilted.
0:49:28|0:49:37|Wu Fuchun sighed as he found himself at a dead end, looked around, then retraced his steps to search for the next exit.
0:49:37|0:49:48|Twenty-eight days have passed in the blink of an eye, and the temperature inside the wooden house has remained at -5 degrees Celsius. At this moment, [Wu Fuchun] still hasn't found a way out, and no sunlight can penetrate the dim ice cracks.
0:49:48|0:49:59|Mental and physical exhaustion forced him to lie on the ground, but he knew the consequences would be unbearable if he continued like this. Thinking of this, [Wu Fuchun] summoned up his spirits and tried to sit up.
0:49:59|0:50:3|He leaned against the ice wall with his legs crossed.
0:50:6|0:50:12|[Wu Fuchun] crossed his legs and stared fiercely ahead for a long time, then pointed to the fishing rod beside him.
0:50:25|0:50:34|[Wu Fuchun] stared at the fishing rod in silence for a long time, then looked up at the faint light shining through the ice.
0:50:38|0:50:50|In this isolated corner, the response [Wu Fuchun] desires is not forthcoming. [Wu Fuchun] purses his lips, watching the sunlight filtering through the ice, then lowers his head in contemplation. Suddenly, a sound behind him catches his attention.
0:50:50|0:51:4|[Wu Fuchun] turned his head alertly and saw a huge hole above. He quickly stood up and, upon seeing the full extent of the hole, couldn't help but open his mouth in shock. On the other side, [Jing Ruyi] was lying on the bed covered in fur, clearly sleeping restlessly.
0:52:54|0:53:13|Outside, the blizzard was raging, causing the wooden door to creak and the chandeliers inside the house to sway constantly. The small rods of the generator outside finally gave way and flew out, breaking the wires that connected to the wooden house. The generator stopped working in an instant, as time passed by slowly.
0:53:13|0:53:45|At this moment, a silence fell, the sound of heartbeats clear and strong. [Wu Fuchun] was pinned under thick snow, unable to speak. After a long time, he finally managed to push open a weak space around him, allowing him to move his body slightly. In this pitch-black depth where he couldn't see his own hand in front of his face, he instinctively took out a lighter. The faint light from the lighter gave [Wu Fuchun] a glimmer of hope. With one hand holding the lighter and the other constantly climbing forward, his backpack on his feet was difficult to drag through the snow.
0:53:46|0:53:58|The lighter suddenly went out, [Wu Fuchun] frantically rubbed the lighter. The more anxious he was, the harder it was to light the lighter. After a while, the lighter finally lit up, and [Wu Fuchun] continued to crawl forward anxiously.
0:53:58|0:54:11|However, as soon as he made a slightly larger movement, the accumulated snow would fall continuously, extinguishing the flames again. In this way, [Wu Fuchun] kept lighting and extinguishing the lighter, switching back and forth between climbing forward.
0:54:11|0:54:23|At this moment, [Wu Fuchun] held up his right hand in the hope of creating hope for himself with his left hand. Thick frost clung to the tips of his hair and eyelashes, and every time the lighter went out, it brought him great fear.
0:54:23|0:54:29|[Jing Ruyi] lay on the bed, holding the Guanyin pendant solemnly in the palm of her hand.
0:54:42|0:54:48|[Wu Fuchun] lit the lighter again, holding a pickaxe and continuously poking the accumulated snow in front.
0:54:48|0:55:0|Every action brought him infinite hope, yet filled with unknown despair. Later, he voluntarily extinguished the lighter, and used both hands to pick up the pickaxe, continuously shoveling the accumulated snow in front.
0:55:0|0:55:6|The snow in front of him had long since turned into ice, and no matter how much he shoveled, very few fragments fell down.
0:55:6|0:55:17|[Wu Fuchun] finally couldn't resist the anxiety in his heart, he lit the lighter again. Holding the lighter in his right hand, his speed of chiseling the ice with one hand slowed down a lot, and the flame went out again.
0:55:17|0:55:29|[Wu Fuchun] shed tears of despair, his hands frozen in place. He then dropped the lighter and began chiseling desperately with a pickaxe. Through the ice, a faint glimmer could now be seen.
0:55:29|0:55:39|The temperature in the small wooden house remains at minus 5 degrees Celsius. [Jing Ruyi], with her lower body exposed, drags her weary legs towards the shelf against the wall where canned goods are placed.
0:55:39|0:55:50|[Jing Ruyi], holding her breath, supporting herself with her left hand on the ground and grabbing onto a piece of floorboard with her right hand, trying hard to stand up. However, the floorboard, which has been neglected for many years, is unable to withstand the strength of an adult.
0:55:50|0:55:57|[Jing Ruyi] stood up and immediately tumbled over, cans rolling all over the floor. [Jing Ruyi] fell to the ground again.
0:55:57|0:56:3|Outside the window, the snow continued to fall without any sign of stopping, [Jing Ruyi] leaned against the shelf with her legs stretched out.
0:56:4|0:56:10|Crying and eating canned food, [Wu Fuchun] looked nothing like his usual self.
0:56:10|0:56:23|[Jing Ruyi]'s food fell out of her mouth as she cried, with no sign of the weather improving outside. The snow on the roof had already exceeded half a meter in thickness, and the sound of frost forming on the windows was unusually clear.
0:56:23|0:56:30|[Jing Ruyi] turned around in confusion, only to see the frost on the glass getting thicker and thicker, making it impossible to see the outside of the house.
0:56:30|0:56:36|She crawled out of the wooden house with her legs dragging behind, the temperature inside and outside was incomparable.
0:56:36|0:56:42|[Jing Ruyi] crawled through the snow with bare legs, mustering all her strength to make her way towards the generator.
0:56:42|0:56:48|When [Jing Ruyi] finally reached it, she found the rope and pulled it out with the last bit of her strength.
0:56:53|0:57:3|[Jing Ruyi] is too weak to ignite the generator. She grasps the rope with both hands, grits her teeth, and pulls hard outward. The rope is unexpectedly torn apart.
0:57:3|0:57:8|She was thrown to the ground by a huge force, still holding a rope that had been pulled and broken in half.
0:57:8|0:57:19|On the other side, a pickaxe emerged from the snow, and [Wu Fuchun] finally crawled out from the crevice. He turned around and, with his last bit of strength, pulled his backpack out from under his feet.
0:57:19|0:57:30|The big storm has stopped, the sunlight is shining unobstructed on the ground, [Jing Ruyi] leans against the generator, looking up at the sky in a calm yet despairing manner.
0:57:30|0:57:37|After a long time, she looked at the discarded tin cans on the wooden box, the sharp cans opening their mouths recklessly.
0:57:37|0:57:48|She stared blankly at the can lid, a different idea forming in her mind. Before long, [Jing Ruyi]'s arm went limp and dropped down, still holding the sharp can lid.
0:57:48|0:58:7|After completing all this, [Jing Ruyi] leaned against the wall with her head tilted, gently closed her eyes, and her other hand lay paralyzed on the ground. The absence of [Wu Fuchun] made her completely desperate, and her failed attempt at self-rescue left her with no courage to live on. She didn't know that she was now the only hope left in [Wu Fuchun]'s heart.
0:58:7|0:58:22|Once out of the ice crack, [Wu Fuchun] rushed back without stopping for a moment, not daring to pause until he joyfully burst into the open doorway, only to find no trace of [Jing Ruyi]. He immediately ran towards the generator and saw the figure that haunted his dreams.
0:58:22|0:58:28|At this moment, [Jing Ruyi]'s face was unusually tranquil, leaning quietly to one side with her body askew.
0:58:28|0:58:37|[Wu Fuchun] rolled and crawled to her side, then lifted her wrist to see the bloody wound that had been cut open.
0:58:39|0:58:50|In the hopeful gaze of [Wu Fuchun], [Jing Ruyi] slowly opened her eyes. Upon seeing [Wu Fuchun]'s face, she revealed a faintly relieved yet weak smile.
0:58:54|0:59:5|[Wu Fuchun] listened to these words and was so sad that he was about to cry. He bent his back and held [Jing Ruyi] tightly in his arms, refusing to let go. From this moment on, their hearts were tightly entwined.
0:59:5|0:59:7|Leaned against each other, never wanting to be separated again.
0:59:7|0:59:16|[Wu Fuchun] fixed the generator and cooked a pot of soup with a small electric stove, while [Jing Ruyi] wrapped herself in a blanket and fur coat and sat back on the lower bunk.
0:59:16|0:59:23|[Wu Fuchun] withdrew her gaze and carefully carried the packed lunch box to the bedside, sitting on the stool next to the bed.
0:59:27|0:59:38|After the robbery, [Jing Ruyi] who was reborn seemed not joyful. She lowered her eyes, her face filled with disappointment. After a long time, she slowly reached out her hands to take the fish soup.
0:59:38|0:59:49|She stared blankly at the lunchbox in her hand, without any desire to eat. Finally, she averted her gaze and slowly placed the fish soup on her lap, [Wu Fuchun] looked up with a sense of grievance.
0:59:52|1:0:1|She chuckled self-deprecatingly with her head down again, and [Jing Ruyi]'s eyes finally focused in this moment as she lifted her head to gaze steadily at [Wu Fuchun].
1:0:2|1:0:8|[Wu Fuchun] looked at [Jing Ruyi] earnestly, with a hint of tears in his eyes.
1:0:10|1:0:19|At this moment, [Jing Ruyi] was already in tears, unable to look into the eyes of [Wu Fuchun]. [Wu Fuchun] held back his tears, his eyes filled with determination and refusal to give up.
1:0:19|1:0:26|The snowstorm finally stopped, the dark clouds slowly dispersed, and in front of the wooden house came the long-awaited calm.
1:0:27|1:0:37|[Wu Fuchun] packed his bags again and prepared to leave. He looked back at the bed uneasily, while [Jing Ruyi] lay motionless on the side facing the wall.
1:0:37|1:0:48|[Wu Fuchun] knew she was still upset about his late return. Thinking about this, [Wu Fuchun] placed his backpack on the table and sat by it, staring expressionlessly at the figure in front of him.
1:1:1|1:1:9|After saying these words, [Wu Fuchun] quietly waited for [Jing Ruyi]'s response. [Jing Ruyi] remained motionless, slowly opening her eyes.
1:1:9|1:1:20|[Wu Fuchun] walked out of the house without looking back after picking up his backpack, while [Jing Ruyi] silently pondered every word he had said, imagining everything [Wu Fuchun] had experienced that day.
1:1:20|1:1:31|All that was done for the survival of the two of them.
1:1:31|1:1:40|Wu Fuchun, who narrowly escaped death, returned to the wooden house. He carefully inventoried all the remaining supplies in the house while also taking care of the weakened Jing Ruyi.
1:1:54|1:2:1|The thirty-fourth number on the wall has also been marked, and time is running out for them on the shoe stool.
1:2:1|1:2:12|[Wu Fuchun] walks in the snow, viewed from above, only a small black dot can be seen. His nose, without a mask, has turned bright red from the cold, and his eyes are showing signs of discomfort.
1:2:12|1:2:22|Wu Fuchun blinked hard, trying to ease the discomfort, then squinted and looked around. Holding a pickaxe, Wu Fuchun walked forward slowly.
1:2:22|1:2:33|His discomfort in the eyes grew stronger, eventually forcing Wu Fuchun to stop and squint hard. His eyes continued to ignore the light, and upon closer inspection, one could see that his eyelids were red.
1:2:33|1:2:44|Conjunctival congestion, in order to relieve the pain, he grabbed two clumps of snow and pressed them against his eyes in an attempt to alleviate it. When he put down the snowballs, his eyes could hardly open.
1:2:44|1:2:56|He tried to squint his eyes, only to find his vision blurred, unable to see clearly, tears streaming down uncontrollably. He stared ahead in confusion, realizing after a while that he couldn't even recognize the direction.
1:2:56|1:3:7|Thinking of this, [Wu Fuchun] immediately crouched on the ground in a panic, searching for the pickaxe. In front of him was a downhill road, but [Wu Fuchun] was completely unaware. He slipped and rolled down directly.
1:3:7|1:3:15|At this moment without a pickaxe, he could only let inertia take him downhill, the heavy backpack made [Wu Fuchun] stand up after half a day.
1:3:15|1:3:30|Antarctica has extremely high visibility on sunny days. From the small wooden house, [Wu Fuchun] can clearly see that he hasn't left the house for long. Anxious to return, he stands in place for a while, lost in thought.
1:3:30|1:3:54|Finally identifying a direction, [Wu Fuchun] cautiously took a step forward, extending one leg tentatively. After confirming the stability of this step, he dared to tremble and step out with the other leg. He widened his eyes trying to discern the general direction of the wooden house, looking around in confusion and uncertainty, although the wooden house should have been within his sight.
1:3:54|1:4:4|He couldn't find his way home, with the red thread on his woolen hat swaying back and forth, coupled with this tearless expression, he looked like a child who couldn't find his way home.
1:4:40|1:4:52|The response was like a beam of light, and he suddenly turned around and ran wildly in the direction of the sound.
1:5:13|1:5:23|[Wu Fuchun] finally let go of all his fears at this moment. He reached out and held [Jing Ruyi]'s hand, kneeling on the stairs by the wooden door, slowly moving closer to her.
1:5:23|1:5:33|[Jing Ruyi] reached out and cupped [Wu Fuchun]'s face in her hands. She looked at his wind-chapped cheeks and stared into his lifeless eyes for a long time.
1:5:33|1:5:42|In the end, she gently embraced him, [Wu Fuchun] leaning on [Jing Ruyi]'s shoulder like a child.
1:5:42|1:5:50|[Wu Fuchun] The pain and grievances of this period finally burst out unabashedly at this moment.
1:5:58|1:6:5|She wrapped a snowball in gauze and gently pressed it against [Wu Fuchun]'s eyes.
1:6:14|1:6:22|[Wu Fuchun] has been exhausted recently. He closed his eyes and fell asleep right after speaking.
1:6:25|1:6:32|[Jing Ruyi] looked at [Wu Fuchun]'s face and gently stroked his hair.
1:6:32|1:6:39|The former flamboyance and emotions have been worn away in this disaster, but life still goes on.
1:6:39|1:6:44|That day, [Wu Fuchun] used the snow on the spot and poured it into the pot used for cooking rice.
1:6:49|1:6:54|[Wu Fuchun] obediently turned a corner, bypassed the pillar in front, and continued walking forward.
1:6:56|1:7:1|[Wu Fuchun] followed the command, changed direction again, and continued walking while kicking.
1:7:4|1:7:14|[Wu Fuchun] poured all the hot water from the pot into the basin in front of [Jing Ruyi], then placed the basin on the wooden table nearby and leaned against the table corner to rest.
1:7:23|1:7:29|[Wu Fuchun] glared indignantly at [Jing Ruyi] before turning around and striding forward with quick steps.
1:7:31|1:7:42|[Jing Ruyi] watched as [Wu Fuchun] clumsily moved, a small smile involuntarily appearing on his lips. Then, without hesitation, he picked up a small pair of scissors and cut off his own hair.
1:7:42|1:7:51|For [Jing Ruyi] and [Wu Fuchun], it was a new beginning. She picked up the jar and poured the hot water from the basin over her head, then closed her eyes lightly.
1:7:51|1:8:1|Feeling the warmth left by the hot water. After washing her hair, she squeezed out the water, then sat on the bench with her legs bent, wiping her shins with a towel.
1:8:1|1:8:9|She secretly glanced at [Wu Fuchun], only to see [Wu Fuchun] obediently squatting at the door with his back to her, which made her feel a hint of unusual emotion.
1:8:9|1:8:19|After discovering some red spots on the inside of his arm, [Jing Ruyi] had [Wu Fuchun] sit back on the bench after a quick bath, and carefully trimmed his beard.
1:8:33|1:8:45|[Jing Ruyi] stopped her movements, looking gently into [Wu Fuchun]'s eyes, unaware that [Wu Fuchun] could already see her eyes clearly through the gauze strip. A smile appeared on his face.
1:8:45|1:8:54|Infected, [Jing Ruyi] also smiled. [Wu Fuchun] carefully touched [Jing Ruyi]'s face, pushed aside her stray hair, and nervously swallowed saliva.
1:8:54|1:8:59|Bending down slowly, [Wu Fuchun] held the face of [Jing Ruyi], who furrowed her brows.
1:9:2|1:9:6|[Jing Ruyi] felt embarrassed and plunged headfirst into [Wu Fuchun]'s chest.
1:9:9|1:9:16|On that day, Wu Fuchun, who had lost his sunglasses, acquired a new piece of equipment, which was Jing Ruyi's underwear.
1:9:16|1:9:25|[Wu Fuchun] fastened the underwear over his eyes.
1:9:28|1:9:36|Ruyi chuckled indulgently, then lowered her head to earnestly write and draw on the notebook.
1:9:47|1:9:59|Ruyi raised her head in surprise, only to find Wu Fuchun's gaze fixed on her chest. She quickly sat up straight and covered her open collar, but in fact Wu Fuchun was not looking at her chest.
1:9:59|1:10:10|With a solemn expression, he knelt down with his body straight, hands clasped together in front of him, devoutly closed his eyes, only to realize that [Wu Fuchun] was looking at the Guanyin pendant hanging on her neck.
1:10:10|1:10:15|She was moved as she looked at the man in front of her who was devoutly worshiping, holding the pendant in her hand.
1:10:15|1:10:19|She composed herself and solemnly held up the pendant in front of [Wu Fuchun].
1:10:19|1:10:37|[Wu Fuchun], after getting enough rest, packed up his belongings and headed towards the door. At this moment, a snowstorm was raging outside. Suddenly, [Wu Fuchun] reached out towards the door latch but hesitated and pulled back his hand. He took a few steps back and ended up standing where Ruyi could see him. Ruyi was sitting on the bed, looking towards [Wu Fuchun].
1:10:39|1:10:48|[Wu Fuchun] stood at the door without saying a word, but the words were like a shot of adrenaline, lodging in his heart. He opened the door without hesitation, and the strong wind and snow immediately blew the wooden door open.
1:10:56|1:11:7|[Wu Fuchun] stood in front, braving the snow as he walked out of the wooden house. He buttoned his undershirt over his eyes, acting as sunglasses, and [Wu Fuchun] looked around, getting used to the environment in front of him.
1:11:7|1:11:18|Heading in the planned direction, with less and less time left for them, he had to seize every opportunity to go out. This time, [Wu Fuchun] was much slower.
1:11:18|1:11:30|He walked cautiously in the snow, not knowing how long had passed. The seabirds around caught the attention of [Wu Fuchun]. He saw the seabirds circling briefly on the mountain peak before flying further away.
1:11:30|1:11:41|[Wu Fuchun] continued to walk in the direction where the seabirds flew, basking in the warm sun. As he climbed a hill and looked down, he spotted a round-headed seal, which showed no fear of humans.
1:11:41|1:11:52|Even when seeing [Wu Fuchun], he just lazily pats his tail [Wu Fuchun], sits down next to the seal, lifts his eye mask and blinks hard, then lazily lies down in the snow.
1:12:30|1:12:37|[Wu Fuchun] looked affectionately at the seal twisting and turning beside him, holding onto his gloves.
1:12:42|1:13:0|The seal seemed to understand Wu Fuchun's muttering, raised its head and gave him a disdainful look. Inside the wooden house, Jing Ruyi was sitting on the bed, holding a small mirror and carefully examining herself. Her lips were already dry and peeling, and the dark circles under her eyes were getting worse, even so.
1:13:0|1:13:8|She still tried to raise a smile, while [Wu Fuchun] curiously looked at the fish swimming under the ice with his buttocks sticking out.
1:13:8|1:13:19|In order to see more clearly, he crouched quite low, these sea fish were ready-made food in the eyes of [Wu Fuchun], but when he saw a giant whale swimming close to the ice surface.
1:13:19|1:13:33|His face turned ashen in an instant, [Wu Fuchun] remained motionless, quietly lying on the ice waiting for the departure of this massive creature. The ice, already cracked, shattered under the tail swipe of a giant whale.
1:13:33|1:13:42|[Wu Fuchun] didn't have time to escape at all. He sat on the ground, nervously shuffling backwards a few steps, and then fell directly into the water. The sea water was turbulent and unfathomable.
1:13:42|1:13:51|The eye-protecting bra and knitted hat were washed away, and to make matters worse, [Wu Fuchun]'s shoe also fell into the deep sea and disappeared without a trace.
1:13:51|1:14:8|But at this moment, [Wu Fuchun] was too preoccupied to care about these. He exerted all his strength to swim to the uppermost level, but due to the refraction of light causing visual distortion, he brushed past the ice cave and collided with the ice layer. Helpless, he had to swim to another place to continue searching for an exit.
1:14:8|1:14:20|However, no matter how many times he tried, he could only hit the ice surface and couldn't see the exit clearly. [Wu Fuchun] had never been so desperate, and the prolonged apnea caused his brain to lack oxygen.
1:14:20|1:14:28|He exhaled his last breath, [Wu Fuchun] helplessly staring with his eyes wide open, hands still raised above his head, slowly sinking towards the seabed.
1:14:28|1:14:36|Suddenly, some magical creatures resembling torpedoes swiftly entered the seabed, swimming agilely. They circled around [Wu Fuchun] in a circle.
1:14:36|1:14:44|Lying on his body rushing towards the ground, he looked up in confusion to see these penguins all rushing in the same direction.
1:14:44|1:15:7|That was the exit, [Wu Fuchun] seemed to see the hope of life, desperately swinging his arms towards the direction of the penguins, holding his breath, he managed to swing his limbs with sheer willpower, swimming upstream. These little penguins easily leaped out of the ice, waddling forward, and with their help, [Wu Fuchun] finally clung to the ice, panting for several breaths.
1:15:7|1:15:16|Still struggling to climb out, [Wu Fuchun] curled up on the ice, shivering with arms crossed, with his hat, backpack, and shoes all gone.
1:15:16|1:15:43|It has become extremely difficult for [Wu Fuchun] to survive here. He is seen stumbling forward barefoot, holding his arms. He hurriedly opens his coat pocket and takes out a few fruit candies. [Wu Fuchun]'s hands are already frozen, unable to open the candy wrappers. Accidentally, he drops the candy on the ground. He struggles to kneel down, picks up the candy, and tremblingly puts it into his mouth to chew. These fruit candies are his only source of energy at the moment.
1:15:43|1:15:52|In the blink of an eye, amidst the wind and snow in Antarctica, [Wu Fuchun] had no idea how long he had been walking, and once again crossed a hill to walk onto a plain.
1:15:52|1:16:0|Without the protection of anti-slip boots, [Wu Fuchun]'s right foot has already frozen stiff, and his clothes have been frozen into a block by the wind and snow.
1:16:0|1:16:18|With frost on his eyebrows and eyelashes, his face stiff and eyes unfocused, [Wu Fuchun] relied on sheer willpower to subconsciously sway his body. He knew he couldn't collapse, as someone was waiting for him to come home. And so, [Wu Fuchun] braved the biting cold wind, step by step, making his way home.
1:16:19|1:16:28|At this moment, [Jing Ruyi] was lying on the bed pretending to sleep, suddenly awakened by the sound of the generator outside. She opened her eyes and looked at the electric stove.
1:16:30|1:16:46|[Wu Fuchun] trembled as he walked into the room, closing the door and leaning on the shelf. Limping through the entrance, [Wu Fuchun]'s face had turned a dark purple from the cold. Upon seeing [Jing Ruyi] safe and sound, he could no longer hold on and collapsed straight to the ground.
1:16:55|1:17:8|[Jing Ruyi] knelt beside [Wu Fuchun], immediately helping him remove his clothes and gloves as he lay unconscious on the ground. Allowing [Jing Ruyi] to manipulate him, [Jing Ruyi] propped up [Wu Fuchun]'s upper body and threw off the ski suit frozen into an ice shell.
1:17:8|1:17:19|On the other side, she pulled off the damp down jacket from inside, then she untied [Wu Fuchun]'s shoes, took off his socks, and his right foot, without a shoe, had already frozen into a dark purple color.
1:17:19|1:17:31|At this moment, [Jing Ruyi] looked at [Wu Fuchun] with worry and fear in her eyes. She calmly took off her coat, realizing that the only way to save him at this moment might be to keep each other warm.
1:17:32|1:17:50|[Wu Fuchun] changed like this for himself. [Jing Ruyi] stripped off all her clothes, pressed her naked body against [Wu Fuchun]'s red chest that was frozen, leaned her head on his chest, slowly transferring her body temperature to him. [Jing Ruyi] closed her eyes, hugged [Wu Fuchun] tightly, and fell asleep.
1:17:50|1:18:4|The snow stopped, the dark clouds dispersed, and the sun once again hung high in the sky over the Antarctic. The wooden cabin was bathed in warm sunlight, and the electric heater was still glowing. [Jing Ruyi] and [Wu Fuchun] lay on the floor next to the square table, still asleep.
1:18:4|1:18:17|[Jing Ruyi] carefully laid a blanket on the ground and covered both of them with it. At this moment, the chill on [Wu Fuchun]'s body had faded away, returning his skin to its normal color. He opened his eyes in confusion and stared blankly for a moment.
1:18:17|1:18:29|After confirming that he was still alive, [Wu Fuchun] took a deep breath and stared blankly at the ceiling. In these few short seconds, he had already replayed everything that had happened in his mind.
1:18:29|1:18:39|Without moving his body, he quietly turned his head to look at the girl lying naked next to him, still sound asleep. [Wu Fuchun] abandoned his usual arrogant demeanor.
1:18:39|1:18:52|Indulgently gazing at the sleeping face of [Jing Ruyi], he couldn't help but smile slightly, then nervously swallowed his saliva, inching his head closer to [Jing Ruyi], but just as [Wu Fuchun] was about to kiss [Jing Ruyi].
1:18:52|1:19:4|Suddenly smelling an unknown odor, Wu Fuchun rushed up to the ski suit next to the electric heater. He hugged the ski suit into his arms and saw a large hole burned on the shoulder.
1:19:4|1:19:15|Through this big hole, he saw the awakened [Jing Ruyi]. [Wu Fuchun] looked at the hole that had already started to fly away with a heartache, responding to [Jing Ruyi] with an puzzled look, after [Jing Ruyi] turned her head away as if avoiding suspicion.
1:19:15|1:19:33|He understood the look in [Jing Ruyi]'s eyes just now, quickly covering his lower body with clothes. The two looked at each other in silence. With his ski suit torn, [Wu Fuchun] could only wrap himself in a thick blanket. On that day, he kept digging in the snow with a shovel. Gradually, a black sole of a shoe emerged. [Wu Fuchun] stopped moving.
1:19:38|1:19:44|[Wu Fuchun] carefully used both hands to cover Natasha's feet with snow again.
1:19:44|1:19:53|And Natasha's boots were taken off by [Wu Fuchun] and put on his own feet, a pair of inconspicuous non-slip boots that were crucial for their survival.
1:19:55|1:20:14|The sudden knock on the door startled [Wu Fuchun], who immediately stood up in alarm and rushed to the door, leaving his lunchbox behind. [Jing Ruyi] also stood up anxiously. As [Wu Fuchun] opened the wooden door, he was instantly chilled to the bone. He carefully scanned the surroundings but found nothing.
1:20:14|1:20:18|[Jing Ruyi] looked worriedly at the door, leaning against the table.
1:20:18|1:20:30|While [Wu Fuchun] stood at the door looking around for a long time, he didn't see a single soul. He was wearing a sweater that couldn't withstand the cold wind at the door, and after a moment, he slowly closed the door.
1:20:31|1:20:38|[Jing Ruyi] anxiously shifted her gaze from the doorway to the window.
1:20:42|1:20:54|Ruyi furrowed her brows and suddenly remembered the shoes of the little deer.
1:20:56|1:21:6|The two of them stared at the door without blinking, but when the wooden door was blown open, they were so scared that they lost their wits. [Wu Fuchun] jumped onto the table and curled up into a ball.
1:21:6|1:21:18|Ruyi pulled [Wu Fuchun] and buried her head tightly in his arms. [Wu Fuchun] then picked up the lunchbox beside him and held it above his head, bravely staring at the door without blinking. At this moment, their nerves were stretched like bowstrings.
1:21:18|1:21:29|At any moment it could break, a gray figure can be seen through the frame, passing through the entrance, walking towards the room, a chubby little penguin appears in front of the two.
1:21:29|1:21:50|[Wu Fuchun] and Ruyi burst into laughter when they see the little penguin, who shows no fear at all. As the humans wobble towards the center and look around, the penguin walks around the room. [Wu Fuchun] quickly jumps off the table, picks up the clothes on the table, and carefully approaches the penguin, who is curiously observing.
1:22:5|1:22:12|Wu Fuchun looked at the chubby penguin in front of him unwillingly, then glanced at Jing Ruyi.
1:22:12|1:22:29|Dejectedly throwing the clothes on the ground, sitting at the end of the bed in a huff, the silly penguin curiously looked at the clothes in front of it, stretched its neck and stuck its head in. [Wu Fuchun] looked eagerly at the little penguin covered with clothes, unable to help but blink his eyes.
1:22:34|1:22:41|The little penguin hit a pillar and fell down in a mess, [Wu Fuchun] looked at the penguin helplessly.
1:22:51|1:23:2|[Wu Fuchun] frowned and looked disapprovingly at Ruyi, then shifted his gaze to the penguin. The little penguin stood obediently in front of [Wu Fuchun], who looked back at Ruyi with a face full of coquettish and pleading expressions.
1:23:26|1:23:33|[Wu Fuchun] tried to reach out and touch the chubby one, but got pecked instead. However, it hopped over to [Jing Ruyi] and let her pat its head.
1:23:36|1:24:0|[Wu Fuchun] looked at the chattering bird and person with a smile on his face. Time waits for no one. [Wu Fuchun] once again set out to find the Antarctic research station. [Jing Ruyi]'s leg had improved after a long period of rest. In his spare time, [Wu Fuchun] even made a simple crutch for him to use. The chubby penguin successfully joined the family and mischievously wandered around while [Wu Fuchun] cooked.
1:24:0|1:24:12|Pecking at his legs, a game that the two of them often play with great joy. Every time they are at home together, they will find a direction and redefine it. [Wu Fuchun] will also offer some constructive suggestions based on experience.
1:24:12|1:24:24|[Wu Fuchun] still slept on the upper bunk, and every time [Jing Ruyi] woke up, the look in his eyes towards the upper bunk was no longer cold and indifferent, but filled with tenderness. He reached out his hand and quietly touched the fingertips of [Wu Fuchun] hanging down.
1:24:24|1:24:35|Time flies, [Jing Ruyi] can finally stand steady with a cane. With the help of [Wu Fuchun], [Jing Ruyi] took a few steps with the cane, and 48 days passed in the blink of an eye.
1:24:35|1:24:44|[Wu Fuchun] stood on the mountaintop, looking out. He brought a sled and had [Jing Ruyi] sit on it, pushing her quickly up the slope towards the peak.
1:24:59|1:25:7|Xiao Pang still likes to peck [Wu Fuchun]'s butt while he is cooking, during this time the two are not fixated on finding the research station.
1:25:7|1:25:15|And willing to spend a lot of time with each other, [Wu Fuchun] picked up the fish and threw it far away, watching the chubby one wobble in a unique way.
1:25:15|1:25:19|55 days have passed, and the food is getting scarcer.
1:25:19|1:25:25|[Wu Fuchun] silently left the canned food for [Jing Ruyi].
1:25:26|1:25:38|[Wu Fuchun] puts the fish back into [Jing Ruyi]'s bowl, using a diminished tone to disguise his care. After the meal, [Wu Fuchun] gathers all the empty cans and bottles into a box and throws them outside the wooden house.
1:25:38|1:25:48|On the diesel tank beside, the clear scale shows that there is not much diesel left. [Wu Fuchun] occasionally pushes the sled, taking [Jing Ruyi] to the nearby hillside to relax.
1:25:48|1:26:0|That day, the two sat side by side at the edge of the snowy cliff, when suddenly [Jing Ruyi] started bleeding from her nostrils. [Jing Ruyi] understood what this meant.
1:26:0|1:26:6|Leaning slowly on [Wu Fuchun]'s shoulder, [Wu Fuchun] smiled and put his arm around [Jing Ruyi]'s shoulder, holding her tighter.
1:26:6|1:26:12|The poster has been painted full of [Jing Ruyi] now, she divided the south into 30 directions.
1:26:12|1:26:22|[Wu Fuchun] searched for a full 60 days, but still found nothing. On this day, after [Wu Fuchun] left the house, he stood in the snow holding a black stone, carefully examining it.
1:27:24|1:27:30|[Wu Fuchun] handed the stone to [Jing Ruyi] as if presenting a treasure, and [Jing Ruyi] looked at the stone for a long time.
1:27:40|1:27:47|Suddenly, it seemed as if a stone at the bottom had melted and sunk in, and [Wu Fuchun] couldn't help but lean in to smell it.
1:28:10|1:28:30|[Wu Fuchun]’s ecstatic smile suddenly froze on his face, [Jing Ruyi] realized and quickly covered her nose, but the blood kept flowing out. She lowered her head, frantically wiping the nosebleed. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t clean it up. Looking at [Wu Fuchun] with a hint of sadness in her eyes, she still mustered up the courage to smile reassuringly at him.
1:28:31|1:28:39|[Wu Fuchun] lies facing the wall, while [Jing Ruyi] faces inside the room with a hint of confusion in her eyes.
1:30:21|1:30:32|[Wu Fuchun] lay on his back, covering his eyes with his arm, trying hard to hold back tears. After saying these words, [Jing Ruyi] also sadly buried her head into the pillow.
1:30:32|1:30:45|Suddenly, [Wu Fuchun] seemed to have made a decision. He climbed down from above, lit a candlestick and placed it on a wooden table. Behind the candlestick was a statue of the Virgin Mary. [Wu Fuchun] knelt in front of [Jing Ruyi] with one knee.
1:31:23|1:31:31|[Jing Ruyi] looked at [Wu Fuchun] in front of her, choked up and unable to speak. [Wu Fuchun] made a gesture of holding a ring box in the air and raised it in front of her.
1:31:44|1:31:49|[Wu Fuchun] carefully took out the imaginary ring from the box and held it up in front of [Jing Ruyi].
1:32:54|1:33:1|[Jing Ruyi] cried uncontrollably, unable to bear looking at [Wu Fuchun] in front of her, and couldn't help but throw herself into his arms.
1:33:1|1:33:11|[Wu Fuchun] firmly embraced [Jing Ruyi], unwilling to let go anymore. At this moment, they no longer needed to hide their emotions, and cried their hearts out, which was a cathartic experience for them.
1:33:11|1:33:22|Time is incredibly cruel. In the blink of an eye, 75 days have passed. The diesel is running out, and the light of the electric heater is gradually dimming, until it finally disappears completely.
1:33:22|1:33:30|Outdoors, the wind and snow picked up again, the temperature dropped sharply, and the generator without diesel lost power. After a few stalls, it slowly came to a stop.
1:33:30|1:33:43|The cruel issue of survival hung over the two like the sword of Damocles once again, as the wind and snow raged outside. [Wu Fuchun] could no longer stay safely at home, they must burn their bridges and find a way out.
1:33:44|1:33:53|In the room, [Jing Ruyi] packs up the luggage for [Wu Fuchun], then takes out a book from her pocket.
1:33:53|1:33:59|[Wu Fuchun] looked at [Jing Ruyi] for a while, then slowly reached out his hand to take the booklet she handed him.
1:34:8|1:34:20|Fuchun looked at [Jing Ruyi] with eyes so gentle they could squeeze out water. Then, under [Jing Ruyi]'s expectant gaze, he opened the book, which was a collection of poems with many annotations in the blank spaces by [Jing Ruyi].
1:34:40|1:34:50|Time cannot be wasted for a moment, Wu Fuchun once again embarked on the journey to find the research station.
1:35:14|1:35:23|[Jing Ruyi]'s teeth have started to fall out.
1:35:48|1:36:3|He took off his shoes, endured the intense pain, and moved his already blackened toes, hoping to persevere a little longer. Exhausted from searching for a way, he sat on a rock and watched the waves crashing against the giant rocks ahead.
1:36:11|1:36:16|Wu Fuchun discovered a huge whale skeleton and stood next to it.
1:36:18|1:36:25|Wu Fuchun couldn't contain the despair in his heart, looking at the skeleton with a sense of hopelessness, then turning to face the turbulent sea.
1:36:25|1:36:30|The waves kept crashing onto the beach, repeating endlessly.
1:36:31|1:36:43|The hollow eye sockets of the skeleton gazed calmly at him, the wind blowing through the bones, making a rustling sound. Fuchun closed his eyes, trying to feel his most genuine thoughts deep inside.
1:36:43|1:37:7|He quickly found the answer, took out a shovel and began to dig the snow under his feet with force. At this moment, the sky over Antarctica was clear, but the glaring sunlight couldn't warm his chest. Soon a large pit was dug, this was the final resting place in Fuchun's heart. He calmly lay in the pit, later Fuchun carried [Jing Ruyi] back to the seaside, [Jing Ruyi] leaned tightly against Fuchun.
1:37:7|1:37:10|Both Wu Fuchun and Jing Ruyi looked at the sea in the distance, neither of them said a word.
1:37:15|1:37:21|Ruyi looked ahead with a melancholy expression, and [Wu Fuchun] pursed his lips and pondered for a while before speaking.
1:37:42|1:37:50|Ruyi greedily gazes at the sky and glaciers in front of her.
1:38:4|1:38:10|[Wu Fuchun] tears streamed down his face, trembling as he forcibly held back from crying out loud.
1:38:36|1:38:40|Ruyi leaned against [Wu Fuchun]'s shoulder, enjoying their final moments together with contentment.
1:38:40|1:38:47|70 days ago, [Wu Fuchun] gave her a reason to live, and now it's her turn to bring the final belief to [Wu Fuchun].
1:38:47|1:38:58|In the end, [Wu Fuchun] listened to her advice. He walked forward with a backpack on his back, braving the wind and snow step by step. Suddenly, he stopped in his tracks, hesitated, and turned around.
1:38:58|1:39:5|Looking back, not far behind him is the cabin, and standing at the door of the cabin is the person he loves the most.
1:39:5|1:39:16|[Wu Fuchun] pursed his lips, lowered his eyes, and couldn't help but glance deeply at Ruyi before turning away in pain. The injury on his right foot was getting worse, so [Wu Fuchun] could only limp forward.
1:39:16|1:39:29|Ruyi didn't return to the house until she couldn't see the figure of [Wu Fuchun]. She glanced at the stove that had never been lit again, limped back to the wooden house, and [Wu Fuchun]'s will to survive was not as strong as before.
1:39:29|1:39:36|Ruyi's physical condition was the biggest blow to him, and he knew Ruyi didn't want to become his burden at the last moment.
1:39:36|1:39:47|Wu Fuchun walked in the snow, occasionally looking back, unaware that [Jing Ruyi] was sitting in the wooden house, never taking his eyes off the place where he disappeared.
1:39:47|1:40:9|During this time alone, [Jing Ruyi] tears down the poster and places it by the seat, repeatedly caressing the areas she had drawn, the numbers marked by arrows. His mouth corners have cracked open in several places, his spirits not as high as before. Meanwhile, [Wu Fuchun] faces the wind and snow, searching for the final way out in this countdown.
1:40:9|1:40:28|The weather in Antarctica turned bad again, [Wu Fuchun] dragged his backpack against the fierce storm, struggling to move forward. The bone-chilling ice shards cut like blades on his face, and the clothes wrapped around his body could only be piled up around his neck. The strong wind made it impossible for him to move forward, and the backpack in his hand was blown away without a trace.
1:40:28|1:40:38|He propped himself up with his hands, crawling forward bit by bit into the storm. In these over 70 days, [Wu Fuchun] had never encountered such harsh weather.
1:40:38|1:40:42|The fierce wind wrapped in snow was mercilessly beating against his face.
1:40:45|1:40:51|The strong wind blew [Wu Fuchun] up and sent him flying backwards.
1:40:51|1:40:54|He instinctively reached out in all directions and finally collapsed on the ground.
1:40:54|1:41:2|At this moment, [Wu Fuchun] couldn't even open his eyes. He gritted his teeth, stepped into the snow with his feet, and then lay down, trying to stick as close to the ground as possible.
1:41:2|1:41:9|The blizzard continued, and soon the visibility around was almost zero, [Wu Fuchun] could no longer be seen.
1:41:9|1:41:18|After who knows how long, the blizzard finally stopped. [Wu Fuchun] was almost completely covered by snow, with only half of his head exposed.
1:41:19|1:41:26|The piercing scream and the icy touch gave Wu Fuchun a sense of awareness.
1:41:26|1:41:35|His eyelashes trembled slightly as a penguin stood in front of him, tilting its head curiously to look at him.
1:41:36|1:41:46|The penguin called out twice to [Wu Fuchun], seemingly indicating for him to move forward. Then it turned around, swaying unsteadily as it walked ahead, revealing the wind vane behind it.
1:41:46|1:41:48|[Wu Fuchun] stood there in a daze for a while.
1:41:48|1:41:58|Hastily propping up his arm and crawling forward, wanting to see clearly, the penguin walked and stopped intermittently, occasionally turning its head to look, as if confirming whether Wu Fuchun was following it.
1:41:58|1:42:9|He brought [Wu Fuchun] to the wind vane, looked at [Wu Fuchun], and gestured for him to look down. Following the penguin's gaze, they saw several colorful steel houses.
1:42:9|1:42:15|The penguin accompanied [Wu Fuchun] for a long time, realizing that it had completed its mission, and then wobbled away.
1:42:15|1:42:27|The penguin waddled forward, swaying its head from side to side. Suddenly, it stopped in its tracks, as if sensing the gaze of Wu Fuchun. It turned its head to look at Wu Fuchun, leaving behind a trail of tiny footprints like maple leaves.
1:42:36|1:42:53|[Wu Fuchun] could only muster enough strength to make it to the nearest house. He collapsed weakly next to the seven of clubs, frustratedly hitting his own legs. He bent down to pick up a stone and began to desperately strike the paint bucket behind him, trying to get the examiner's attention.
1:43:6|1:43:11|[Wu Fuchun] collapsed on the ground, then looked unwillingly towards the nearby colored steel house.
1:43:40|1:43:57|In the moment of despair for [Wu Fuchun], a group of people in orange ski suits ran towards him. He turned his head stiffly and looked sideways in confusion. In that moment, tears filled [Wu Fuchun]'s eyes, along with a glimmer of hope. It wasn't just himself, but also [Jing Ruyi], who was saved.
1:43:57|1:44:4|Four researchers hurriedly took [Wu Fuchun] on a heavy snow vehicle to the small wooden house, with [Wu Fuchun] sitting inside.
1:44:4|1:44:22|At the thought of seeing [Jing Ruyi] soon, his mouth couldn't help but curl up, the snowmobile raced at full speed, sometimes driving by the sea, sometimes heading towards the snowfield, the vehicle rushed towards the wooden house without stopping, suddenly the driver slammed on the brakes, causing everyone to stumble.
1:44:22|1:44:29|In front of them, an avalanche occurred in the snowy mountains, with snow blocks making a thunderous noise as they rolled down overwhelmingly.
1:44:29|1:44:33|And the wooden house is just a few kilometers away from the foot of the mountain.
1:44:33|1:44:40|The inspector had no time to think about a rapid retreat, and it was only then that [Wu Fuchun] saw the illusion behind through the car window.
1:44:40|1:44:44|The snowmobile raced forward at a speed matching that of the avalanche,
1:44:47|1:45:5|[Wu Fuchun] opened the car door and tried to rush out, but was firmly grabbed by two members of the scientific expedition team. At this moment, all he could see was a vast expanse of white, and he could no longer see the shadow of the wooden house. [Wu Fuchun] stood still, staring ahead blankly. He thought of the people in the wooden house waiting for him to come home, and he recklessly wanted to rush down.
1:45:6|1:45:14|Two expedition members quickly grabbed [Wu Fuchun]'s shoulders and dragged him back, knowing better than anyone the terror of an avalanche.
1:45:18|1:45:28|[Wu Fuchun] lay by the car door, wailing in despair towards the direction of the avalanche.
1:45:28|1:45:34|Several members of the scientific expedition team could only hold on tightly to [Wu Fuchun] and take him away from this dangerous place.
1:45:34|1:46:0|In [Wu Fuchun]'s dream, this scene kept appearing. That day, he carefully placed the candlestick on the wooden table, illuminating the face of the Virgin Mary. Inside the small wooden house, he knelt down on one knee, gently took her hand, and devoutly put the imaginary ring on [Jing Ruyi]'s ring finger. After putting on the ring, [Wu Fuchun] raised his hand to lift the white veil covering [Jing Ruyi]'s head. [Jing Ruyi] then obediently lowered her head to look into [Wu Fuchun]'s eyes.
1:46:0|1:46:4|After completing everything with the shy little girl, [Wu Fuchun] also looked affectionately at [Jing Ruyi].
1:46:6|1:46:21|At this moment, their eyes were only on each other. Then [Wu Fuchun] slowly leaned towards [Jing Ruyi] and gently brushed her lips. [Wu Fuchun] lay on the hospital bed, opening his eyes blankly. The room was dark, but occasionally a streak of light would pass over his cheeks.
1:46:21|1:46:32|[Wu Fuchun] turned his head to look out the window, at this moment the white day in Antarctica had completely passed, and polar night had arrived. The aurora floated lightly, sometimes dim, sometimes bright.
1:46:32|1:46:43|A deep blue-green light emanated, and [Wu Fuchun] seemed to grasp the truth that [Jing Ruyi] had been studying at this moment. He stared fixedly at the magnificent aurora outside the window.
1:46:43|1:46:54|The brilliant light illuminated the eyes of [Wu Fuchun], revealing not only the shock of beauty, but also his endless yearning. He leaned towards the edge of the bed, yet his eyes were reluctant to move away from the aurora.
1:46:54|1:47:6|Because [Jing Ruyi] has deeply engraved the aurora in his heart, thinking of this, [Wu Fuchun] sadly lowers his eyes, drifting to the other side, that is the ski suit he is wearing, also [Jing Ruyi]'s ski suit.
1:47:6|1:47:13|[Wu Fuchun] gently stroked the ski suit and then pulled out the survival guide for Antarctica that [Jing Ruyi] had given him from the outer pocket.
1:47:13|1:47:19|[Wu Fuchun] flipped through a few pages, carefully drawing two red lines on each note.
1:47:19|1:47:40|At this moment, [Wu Fuchun] trembled as he held the survival manual, unable to control his emotions and bent down to cry. He held back his tears and turned a few more pages, only to find the Guanyin pendant that [Jing Ruyi] always wore around her neck lying quietly in the manual. He took the jade pendant out of the manual and held it in his hand, examining it carefully.
1:47:40|1:47:46|Suddenly he remembered the day when [Jing Ruyi] saved him with her body temperature, and he made the most sincere promise to Guanyin.
1:47:46|1:47:53|[Wu Fuchun] looked out the window and saw a familiar sight, one that [Jing Ruyi] loved dearly.
1:47:53|1:47:56|He didn't believe that [Jing Ruyi] would sit idly by in the cabin.
1:47:56|1:48:4|So [Wu Fuchun] escaped and rode a snowmobile, speeding towards a snowy slope. [Wu Fuchun] quickly arrived at the foot of a snowy hill.
1:48:4|1:48:16|The road here is rugged and often has protruding rocks. Despite increasing the horsepower, the snow keeps flipping out from under the wheels without any progress. [Wu Fuchun] limps up the hill towards the slope.
1:48:16|1:48:24|This is the place he and [Jing Ruyi] agreed upon.
1:48:34|1:48:42|[Wu Fuchun] knelt down in front of the snow pit and saw [Jing Ruyi] lying inside as if asleep.
1:48:50|1:48:55|[Wu Fuchun] held [Jing Ruyi]'s hand and looked into her eyes with deep affection.
