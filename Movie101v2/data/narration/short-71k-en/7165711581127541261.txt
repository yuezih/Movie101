0:1:7|0:1:16|Under the cover of night, the deserted courtyard was shrouded in smoke, and the crackling sound of unburnt incense filled the air, creating a stark contrast in the quiet darkness.
0:1:17|0:1:27|Thick smoke drifted to the front of the dilapidated door, where two men with numerous wounds stood. One was lying at the doorway, while the other leaned against the wall not far away.
0:1:27|0:1:29|The two of them remained motionless, as if they had stopped breathing.
0:1:30|0:1:36|At the east gate of the city, several armed Japanese soldiers walked to the corner of the wall and turned around.
0:1:36|0:1:42|Following behind are several members of the pseudo army band, kicking their legs high and blowing horns and beating drums.
0:1:42|0:1:46|Later, the members stopped in front to play military music to welcome the Japanese army into the city.
0:1:47|0:1:55|In front of the notice board, a small translator with a big hat and a pistol bag slung diagonally across his chest walked over, [Zhao Yangren].
0:1:55|0:2:3|After stopping, He Hua pretentiously straightened his standard traitorous attire, listening to the music while surveying the common people around him.
0:2:3|0:2:14|After the performance, [Zhao Yangren] approached the Japanese captain with a flattering smile, received a nod of approval, then turned towards the civilians. Clearing his throat, he began to speak.
0:2:16|0:2:17|He Hua hurriedly returned to the Japanese army.
0:2:46|0:2:53|He Hua looked expectantly at the people, but no one congratulated him. After a moment, the fake smile on his face disappeared.
0:2:53|0:3:4|After scanning the entire room with a bright gaze, he turned and walked towards the salted fish vendor on the left. Seeing the vendor leaning lazily with his head, he smiled maliciously and spoke.
0:3:7|0:3:13|Before the other side had agreed, the pseudo army behind came up and checked the number of shoes.
0:3:15|0:3:23|Approaching the next vendor, He Hua carefully examined the stall before speaking.
0:3:23|0:3:29|After speaking, he lowered his head to look at the fish in front of the old man, but a pungent smell made him furrow his brow.
0:3:41|0:3:45|At this moment, the Japanese captain stopped and aimed the trigger at the old man.
0:3:45|0:3:55|After the old man fell to the ground, blood gushed from his chest. [Hu Shuisheng] grabbed a knife and tried to charge at the Japanese soldiers, but his companion quickly stopped him, putting a sack over [Hu Shuisheng]'s head and dragging him away from the scene.
0:3:58|0:4:1|After speaking, [Yu Mancang] plunged into the nearby lake and swam further and further away.
0:4:27|0:4:35|On the other side, the young soldier handed the telegram to Commander Zhou, who had a pistol holster around his waist. After reading it, he relaxed his brows and let out a slight sigh.
0:5:10|0:5:14|The political commissar nodded in approval, and [Commander Zhou] turned back to continue speaking.
0:5:35|0:5:39|After listening to the political commissar, Chou Rong once again climbed onto Commander Zhou's face.
0:6:9|0:6:19|On the clear lake surface, a small boat is slowly moving forward. The girl [He Hua], dressed in bright clothes, sits quietly at the bow, her bright eyes revealing her love for this world.
0:6:19|0:6:25|A gust of wind blows, causing lotus leaves to dance gracefully on the lake, as the girl [He Hua] navigates her small boat through them.
0:6:25|0:6:32|As the sky darkened, [He Hua] came ashore and arrived at the uncle's house. She sat on a wooden stool, looking at the uncle opposite with a troubled expression.
0:6:40|0:6:44|The middle-aged man with a blue face shook his head as he listened to [He Hua]'s persuasion.
0:7:29|0:7:31|As the silver light of the lotus faded, [Hu Shuisheng] walked in.
0:7:31|0:7:36|He complained while grabbing food and throwing it at [Hu Shuisheng].
0:8:9|0:8:12|[He Hua] said, and then she was about to go out to chase the sound of water that had just left.
0:8:12|0:8:16|The uncle hurriedly stopped him, his thin face filled with confusion.
0:8:16|0:8:24|After hesitating for a moment, he turned and walked towards the dining table, picked up the cooked corn on the table, and handed it to [He Hua].
0:8:27|0:8:38|The uncle's gaze followed He Hua until she disappeared in the direction of the departing water sound. In the sky covered with dark clouds, a glimpse of the moon gradually appeared.
0:8:38|0:8:47|[He Hua] saw Hu Shuisheng standing alone by the side of the boat, and she walked towards him quietly. At that moment, the despair in Hu Shuisheng's eyes surged like a raging tide.
0:8:51|0:8:58|Sensing He Hua's worried look, she suppressed her inner distress, adjusted her state, and explained to He Hua.
0:8:58|0:9:9|The Sand Lake guerrilla team was ambushed by the Japanese devils, and [He Hua] couldn't hide her sorrowful expression. After a moment of silence, she spoke.
0:9:12|0:9:16|The sadness in their eyes was impossible to hide.
0:9:21|0:9:28|After Shuisheng finished speaking, he closed his eyes in despair, leaving He Hua at a loss for words on how to comfort him.
0:9:32|0:9:38|She handed the corn to [Hu Shuisheng], who shook his head and sighed, indicating no appetite.
0:9:38|0:9:45|[He Hua] is well aware of the troubles in [Hu Shuisheng]'s heart. After pondering for a moment with his head in his hands, he speaks up to offer advice.
0:9:59|0:10:8|The moonlight was dim, reflecting on the shimmering lake. The flags by the lake were blown so hard that they couldn't stand straight, still stubbornly struggling.
0:10:18|0:10:22|[Hu Shuisheng] didn't know why he was being asked, so he could only nod helplessly.
0:10:54|0:11:1|Watching He Hua's eyes filled with determination, Hu Shuisheng slowly rid himself of his hesitation.
0:11:1|0:11:4|After a moment of contemplation, he sighed deeply with a lowered gaze.
0:11:19|0:11:30|After receiving affirmation from [He Hua], [Hu Shuisheng]'s previously despondent expression vanished, and he gazed at this woman who brought him hope with determination.
0:11:30|0:11:39|The faint light pierced through the thin mist, shining the first rays of dawn on two vibrant young men chatting about the future.
0:12:8|0:12:13|Facing Ban Tian's praise, [Zhao Yangren] showed a flattering smile, exchanged pleasantries, and then finished his drink in one gulp.
0:13:4|0:13:12|Outside the courtyard, the searchlight on the makeshift cannon tower sweeps around, while two Japanese soldiers with rifles on their backs take turns patrolling the area.
0:13:12|0:13:28|Under the reed marsh by the wall, [He Hua] moved swiftly with a harpoon in hand, advancing with a bow on his back. With agile movements, he maneuvered under the watchful eyes of the Japanese soldiers, reaching the closest point to them. He then took out a slingshot and aimed at the kerosene lamp nailed to the wood.
0:13:28|0:13:36|The collision of stones and wood startled the Japanese soldiers, and [Yu Mancang] angrily threw a harpoon at them before fleeing.
0:13:36|0:13:45|In the early morning, [Yu Man Cang] arrived at the assembly point with a sullen expression. Thinking about the failure of the water blockade and ambush yesterday, he once again vented his anger on the reed fluff in his hand.
0:13:46|0:13:59|Catching the gaze of everyone's attention, he did not feel guilty for being late. He walked towards the bamboo pavilion, sat down in front of everyone without any courtesy, and started speaking as soon as He Hua took his seat, with Hu Shuisheng adjusting his tone.
0:14:25|0:14:33|Jian [Yu Mancang] is still angry because of his own obstruction yesterday, and [Hu Shuisheng] doesn't want to explain anymore.
0:14:33|0:14:40|[He Hua] saw [Hu Shuisheng] in a difficult situation, stood up and moved closer to her, then slowly spoke.
0:15:40|0:15:43|The guerrilla fighters waited with puzzled expressions for an answer.
0:16:18|0:16:24|Night falls, the anti-Japanese team rowed a boat closer to the Japanese army's garrison.
0:16:24|0:16:31|To avoid the searchlights of the Japanese army, [Hu Shuisheng] and others crowded together in the cabin, not daring to move.
0:16:31|0:16:36|Near the camp, several people slowly stood up and climbed up the reed bank to observe the movements of the Japanese guards.
0:16:41|0:16:55|Several people quietly moved under the eyes of the Japanese army, and when they reached the bottom of the Japanese army's defensive wall, a tense atmosphere arose. The glaring searchlights kept sweeping back and forth, as [He Hua] crawled under the wall, ready to take action at any moment.
0:16:55|0:17:4|The Japanese soldiers stationed on the wall did not notice any abnormalities around them and were still in a relaxed state of alert. Below the wall, the anti-Japanese team anxiously waited for the right moment.
0:17:5|0:17:9|At this moment, a Japanese soldier walked down the wall to relieve himself.
0:17:9|0:17:18|Under the cover of night, the Japanese troops above remained completely unaware, relying on their well-trained patience to remain motionless even as the scent of incense wafted down from above.
0:17:18|0:17:24|Just as the other party was about to leave, [He Hua] leaped up and pulled down the Japanese soldier by the ankle.
0:17:26|0:17:48|The Japanese soldiers slid into the sack in Hu Shuisheng's hands like a ball. He Hua, with her agile and strong physique, picked up the sack and ran in the opposite direction. Commander Zhou quickly picked up the enemy's dropped rifle as well.
0:18:9|0:18:21|[Ban Tian] was furious upon learning that the soldier was missing. After the soldier who took the blame left, he turned around and looked at [Translator Liang], who had never dared to look him in the eye. He walked towards him thoughtfully and asked.
0:18:37|0:18:43|Upon seeing He Hua suddenly smile, all anger dissipated, Translator Liang quickly followed suit with a smile.
0:18:56|0:19:2|[Hu Shuisheng] and [Yu Mancang], along with [Hu Bingkun], throw the sack containing Japanese soldiers' bodies into the lake.
0:19:31|0:19:36|Commander Zhou is furious as he is completely unaware of the enemy's situation.
0:19:36|0:19:39|His silent and timid appearance scared his subordinates into silence. 
0:21:35|0:21:54|Speak up, as the crowd dispersed, turned around, [Yu Man Cang] led the new team members to the bottom of the city wall. The three of them followed the wall, knocking and feeling behind the soldiers. They gagged the soldiers without mouths, picked up their guns, and cooperated tacitly. In the blink of an eye, the Japanese sentry was knocked unconscious and carried away. Together with [Hu Shuisheng] leading another team, they closely watched for isolated enemies in the reed marsh.
0:21:55|0:22:11|He rushed forward to grab the rifle, while the team members put sacks on the Japanese soldiers, carried the sacks on their shoulders, applied oil on the soles of their feet, and [Hu Shuisheng] led the third team to sneak out from the corner, cautiously approaching the Japanese sentries. Skillfully, they put sacks on the sentries and then withdrew.
0:22:11|0:22:20|The three squads put all the captured Japanese soldiers onto the small boat, each tied up in a sack with a lotus flower attached, and threw them into the center of the lake. They quickly disappeared into the water.
0:22:23|0:22:31|The ripples in the lake quickly returned to calm, and a few seconds later, the beautiful He Hua emerged from the water, breaking free from the sack.
0:23:14|0:23:20|[Zhao Yangren] stood in front of the table, carefully observing the other person's expression. After a while, he suddenly stood up, slammed the table, and shouted.
0:23:23|0:23:26|A Japanese patrol team in the lake carefully inspects the machine gun set up at the bow of the boat.
0:23:53|0:24:1|[Zhao Yangren] led the puppet army squad to set up an ambush on the shore, while the anti-Japanese team sailed in a small boat in the lake, always maintaining a state of combat readiness.
0:24:1|0:24:4|On the other side, Commander Zhou quickly walked towards the political commissar studying the map.
0:25:26|0:25:30|He Hua is being harassed by a member of the pseudo army, and Zhao Yangren speaks out to reprimand them.
0:26:33|0:26:37|Translator Liang approached Zhao Yangren unhurriedly and asked after getting closer.
0:27:12|0:27:23|After Translator Liang left, Zhao Yangren put away the smile of Fengcheng Temple, furrowed his brows, and walked thoughtfully towards the entrance of the command post, his mind filled with thoughts of the fish-selling girl.
0:27:23|0:27:35|He suddenly turned around, his fierce eyes staring in the direction where He Hua had left, and then he gave instructions to his followers.
0:27:35|0:27:38|The assistant immediately set out to find He Hua upon hearing the order.
0:27:39|0:27:47|Seeing them following behind, he pondered for a moment, put away his malicious expression, turned around and walked into the command post.
0:27:47|0:27:53|On their way home, [He Hua] and [Hu Shuisheng] noticed they were being followed, so they immediately lowered their heads and quickened their pace.
0:27:53|0:27:59|However, He Hua and Hu Shuisheng were caught off guard by the unexpected appearance of [Yu Mancang] taking a shortcut.
0:27:59|0:28:7|[Zhao Yangren] quickly walked to the front of the Ban Tian house, stopped in front of the door, kept stretching his neck to look at Li, hesitated for a long time, and called out softly.
0:28:12|0:28:20|Upon hearing his voice, Ban Tian turned around, casting a contemptuous glance at him, and stepped out of the threshold to stand in front of the house.
0:28:20|0:28:25|[Zhao Yangren] quickly put on a smile and stood behind him, waiting to be questioned.
0:29:54|0:29:59|This is [the yoga woman].
0:30:7|0:30:9|He looked at it excitedly for a long time.
0:31:14|0:31:21|After [Zhao Yangren] left, he spent half a day pondering over everything that had happened, and the appearance of [He Hua] left him puzzled.
0:31:29|0:31:37|Translator Liang walked down from the temple's arched bridge, caught sight of Zhao Yangren's men who were sent to track him, ignored them, and quickly walked away.
0:31:37|0:31:47|On the other side, [He Hua] suddenly stopped and bowed her head.
0:31:47|0:31:54|After speaking, the two turned their heads, dropped their bags, and walked towards their entourage.
0:31:54|0:31:58|Seeing the situation, the follower wanted to turn around and run, but unexpectedly turned around and bumped into a full load of carrying poles.
0:32:1|0:32:4|Upon seeing this scene, [Hu Shuisheng] and the other person turned and left.
0:32:4|0:32:11|After shaking off the tail, He Hua and Hu Shuisheng walked listlessly in the reed marsh, feeling a bit lost in their hearts.
0:32:44|0:32:54|[He Hua], dressed up as a peasant woman in a rice field, carrying a bamboo basket, looked around to make sure there was no one following her, and then headed towards the main hall of the temple.
0:32:55|0:33:10|In the middle of the hall, a man is kneeling and praying, with a nun standing beside him reciting scriptures in a low voice. [He Hua] walks quietly towards the front, sets down the bamboo basket on the side, then kneels beside the man, clasping her hands together in prayer.
0:33:10|0:33:15|After a moment, she opened her eyes and looked at the man beside her, then spoke slowly.
0:34:5|0:34:12|After the conversation, Translator Liang closed his eyes tightly and continued to pray, while He Hua devoutly kowtowed to the idol.
0:34:12|0:34:15|He Hua stood up and walked towards the nun on the side.
0:34:19|0:34:24|The two walked slowly along the pillars beside the fence of the Buddha statue towards the main hall.
0:34:24|0:34:33|At the end of the inner room, there is a back door that leads out of the main hall. [He Hua] followed the nun's footsteps and stepped out of the back door, quickly returning to the gathering place of the team.
0:34:42|0:34:47|Seeing no one responding, she looked around for a few figures.
0:34:55|0:34:57|The uncle came out from the inner room.
0:35:40|0:35:43|[He Hua] answered ambiguously, leaving the old man completely puzzled.
0:35:43|0:35:47|Seeing his anxious expression, [Hu Shuisheng] felt a hint of unease in his heart.
0:35:47|0:35:52|After He Hua left, Uncle hesitated for a moment, then quietly rolled up his cigarette and followed.
0:35:52|0:35:57|The last ray of sunlight was wiped away by the night, and the evening wind fiercely shuttled through the reeds.
0:35:57|0:36:5|[He Hua] hurriedly went to the Sand Lake Town where [Hu Shuisheng] and others were ambushed, completely unaware of the uncle closely following behind.
0:36:5|0:36:9|On the other side, [Hu Shuisheng] led Xiulian and others to ambush near the Japanese outpost.
0:36:14|0:36:22|[Hu Shuisheng] carefully observed the movements of the Hong Kong young hero soldiers, while Xiulian, seeing that he remained unmoved, urged impatiently once again.
0:36:31|0:36:37|[Hu Shuisheng] rolled up his sleeves and prepared for battle, accidentally brushing his right hand against [Hu Shuisheng]'s forearm.
0:36:37|0:36:44|Feeling something soft, [Hu Shuisheng] looked down and saw a mosquito sucking blood on his forearm.
0:36:44|0:36:48|He was scared and wanted to scream, [Hu Shuisheng] promptly covered his mouth.
0:36:55|0:36:59|Upon hearing Commander Zhou urging him as well, Hu Shuisheng hesitated for a moment before speaking.
0:37:21|0:37:29|Although He Hua felt unwilling, she could only wait in place due to orders, as the two of them stealthily approached the Japanese position hand in hand.
0:37:29|0:37:36|At the signal from Hu Shuisheng, He Hua shot at the sentry with a slingshot, but the sentry showed no response, prompting him to prepare for action.
0:37:36|0:37:43|At the critical moment when the military was about to open fire, [He Hua] arrived in time to hold back the two men, using the muzzle to command the enemy to turn off the searchlight.
0:37:43|0:37:46|[Yu Man Cang] at the meeting, drew the bowstring, aimed at the light bulb, and hit it with one shot.
0:37:59|0:38:6|After Xiulian counterattacked and retreated, [Hu Shuisheng] was scared by the gunfire and hugged his head in the corner of the room.
0:38:6|0:38:10|The three of them, seeing the situation, were forced to join the battle and began to fight back.
0:38:28|0:38:37|In order to protect the injured team member, [Hu Shuisheng] and another person lured the enemy into a dense reed marsh, and [Commander Zhou] personally led the team to capture them.
0:38:44|0:38:45|No one emerged from the reeds.
0:38:47|0:38:52|Monkey Mao is cunning and familiar with [Mrs. Liu].
0:39:21|0:39:35|After receiving the order, a soldier started a fire from the base of the reeds, while another soldier threw his torch directly into the lush reed bed. Now, flames could be seen rolling and thick smoke filled the entire reed bed.
0:39:35|0:39:43|The rocket wind grew stronger and soon reached the hiding place of the two, forcing them to constantly dodge the fire while fleeing.
0:39:48|0:39:54|Shuisheng forcibly dragged He Hua forward, and He Hua stopped after exhausting all her energy.
0:40:20|0:40:26|[Hu Shuisheng] carries [He Hua] on his back and continues to run, while on the other side, [Commander Zhou] looks on coldly as the fire spreads.
0:40:26|0:40:34|At the same time, [Hu Shuisheng] and another person used hollow reed poles to sneak into the water, taking advantage of the lake water to successfully escape from the encirclement of the Japanese army.
0:40:41|0:40:52|[Hu Shuisheng] plunged into the water, and when he resurfaced, he had a handful of mud in his hand, which he then evenly smeared on the faces of [He Hua] and himself.
0:40:52|0:40:55|After the scorching heat subsided, the two swam towards the shore.
0:40:55|0:41:4|In the Japanese army headquarters, everyone returned empty-handed. [Sakata] was burning with anger, followed closely by [Translator Liang], subordinate officers, and [Zhao Yangren] who were all on edge.
0:41:5|0:41:23|He angrily threw the gloves onto the conference table, sat down immediately, suppressed the anger in his heart, and glared at [Zhao Yangren].
0:41:23|0:41:26|The three of them quickly lowered their heads and retreated in fear.
0:41:28|0:41:33|Commander Zhou and the members of the anti-Japanese squad are all waiting for the return of Hu Shuisheng and Hu Bingkun.
0:41:33|0:41:39|[Yu Man Cang] was in a stalemate, snatching back and forth, sometimes glancing at the team flag, sometimes looking towards the path leading to [Commander Zhou].
0:41:39|0:41:44|After waiting for a long time without seeing their figures, [Yu Mancang] hesitated for a moment.
0:41:58|0:42:3|In the county town, [Zhao Yangren] walked down the street with his head down, wearing sunglasses and a serious expression.
0:42:3|0:42:11|On the other side of the street, He Hua, who brought Xiulian to town to gather information, noticed Zhao Yangren strolling alone by chance while looking around.
0:42:11|0:42:16|He pulled Xiulian and hurried to the roadside stall, pretending to be a customer, watching the other party getting closer and closer to him.
0:42:17|0:42:20|The two quickly lowered their heads to avoid being noticed by each other.
0:42:20|0:42:27|[Zhao Yangren] stopped at the entrance of the alley, looked around but didn't notice anything unusual, then turned and walked into the narrow lane.
0:42:27|0:42:44|[Yu Man Cang] saw someone disappear at the end of the alley, hurriedly pulled the embroidered curtain and chased after, with half of his head sticking out behind the wall, staring intently at [Zhao Yangren]. The embroidered curtain cautiously looked behind, and when they saw that the other party had not noticed, they continued to follow. After [Zhao Yangren] passed by, he stuck his head out from the top of the wall and continued to stare intently.
0:42:44|0:42:48|The lush reeds grow out of the water, resembling an ocean.
0:42:48|0:42:53|[He Hua] and [Hu Shuisheng] hung their myopic coats on the reeds, lying on the ground basking in the sun.
0:43:29|0:43:36|When it comes to happy memories of the past, [He Hua] suddenly got up and looked towards the water with a joyful expression.
0:44:2|0:44:8|After speaking, [He Hua] immersed herself in memories, and [Hu Shuisheng] casually noticed the necklace around her neck.
0:44:8|0:44:12|After the shock, [Hu Shuisheng] relaxed his brows and asked with a smile in his eyes.
0:44:14|0:44:19|[He Hua] lowered her head to look at the necklace, lost in thought for a moment before speaking.
0:44:42|0:44:52|The two locked eyes, the atmosphere becoming increasingly intense, and [Hu Shuisheng] quickly shifted the conversation shyly.
0:44:52|0:45:2|In the alley, [Yu Mancang] crouched on the wall, in front of the banquet hall, Xiulian anxiously asked below.
0:45:2|0:45:7|In the room, [Zhao Yangren], who has just finished enjoying the rain, stands up and leisurely buttons up his shirt.
0:45:10|0:45:28|Upon hearing the woman's whimper, he turned around and burst into laughter.
0:45:33|0:45:42|Wash up at night, [Yu Mancang] on the wall, aiming at [Zhao Yangren] just stepping out of the house.
0:45:42|0:45:46|Zhao Yangren wailed in pain, scaring He Hua and Hu Shuisheng into quickly retreating.
0:45:46|0:45:48|In the bamboo pavilion, the resistance team holds a meeting.
0:47:26|0:47:31|The sound of water grew louder, and they quickly shouted to stop them and guide them forward.
0:47:31|0:47:33|[Yu Mancang] turned around reluctantly.
0:48:4|0:48:18|After listening to Shuisheng, he also realized his mistake. After a brief exchange of eye contact and sleeve signals, [He Hua], follow the command.
0:48:53|0:49:6|[He Hua] arrived and found the temple courtyard empty. Instead of entering the main hall directly, she hid behind a stone pillar, carefully observing her surroundings. After confirming there was no apparent danger, she pondered for a moment before walking towards the main hall.
0:49:6|0:49:13|During the process, she remained vigilant and, as she was about to step over the threshold, she ran into [Ban Tian] who had just come out of the hall.
0:49:13|0:49:19|[Ban Tian] glanced at [He Hua] who dared not look up beside him, hesitated briefly, and then walked towards the monk below the steps.
0:49:20|0:49:26|[He Hua], who narrowly escaped, did not leave immediately but instead hid under a tree, closely watching the two men.
0:49:26|0:49:32|Seeing the two standing in front of the pavilion hesitantly, [He Hua] felt a surge of doubt and unease in her heart.
0:49:32|0:49:37|Not long after, [Itada] put his hands together, bowed to the monk in gratitude, and then turned and left.
0:49:38|0:49:44|Waiting for [Itada] to completely disappear from her sight, [He Hua] finally entered the main hall.
0:49:44|0:49:49|Skillfully looking around in all directions, He Hua walked through the Buddha statues and proceeded towards the main hall with a calm demeanor.
0:49:49|0:49:55|As they were approaching their destination, she couldn't help but look back to see if there were any suspicious individuals following them.
0:49:55|0:50:0|After making sure there was no one else in the hall, [He Hua] quickly walked to the altar.
0:50:0|0:50:4|Feigning humility and giving thanks, while observing for any unfamiliar individuals in the surroundings.
0:50:6|0:50:22|[He Hua]'s vigilant behavior caught the attention of the monks in the courtyard. One of them suspiciously crouched by the window, peering through the gap in the glass to monitor him. He pushed up the incense burner with his left hand, reached in with his right hand to take out a piece of paper, and quickly left the temple.
0:50:22|0:50:30|Approaching the bridge pier by the river, He Hua looked around and made sure no one was paying attention to him before swiftly slipping into the archway.
0:50:30|0:50:33|Putting down the bamboo basket of love, He Hua took out the note from the cuff and opened it to read.
0:50:41|0:50:52|[He Hua] immediately tore up the intelligence left by [Yu Man Cang] after reading it, bent down to take out a student uniform from the bamboo basket on the ground, quickly changed into it, and then turned back towards the temple.
0:50:52|0:50:59|Returning, [He Hua] happened to run into the monk who had spoken with [Ban Tian], sneaking around the altar looking for something.
0:50:59|0:51:4|After a moment of contemplation, she turned and walked away, heading to the lakeside where [Yu Man Cang], who had been waiting for her arrival, was stationed.
0:51:5|0:51:14|Seeing him emerge from the dense reeds, He Hua immediately stood up, steadied the swaying boat, and helped him onto the small boat. As the two got on board, the boatman began to row.
0:51:54|0:51:58|In the command post, [Zhao Yangren], with his arm bandaged, looked timidly towards [Ban Tian].
0:52:1|0:52:10|Seeing the other person feeling down, [Ban Tian] slowly walked to his side, placed his left hand on his right shoulder, and [Zhao Yangren] immediately lowered his head and stood up.
0:52:37|0:52:51|At these words, [Zhao Yangren] instantly felt a chill in his heart, seeking help with his eyes towards [Bankfield].
0:53:48|0:53:52|[He Hua] listened to [Hu Shuisheng]'s suggestion, pondered for a moment, and then spoke.
0:54:41|0:54:46|Alright, the three of them quickly agreed and immediately split up to take action.
0:54:46|0:54:49|[He Hua] returns to the base, while [Hu Shuisheng] and [Hu Bingkun] head to the temple.
0:54:49|0:54:51|A meeting is held by the Japanese army.
0:55:1|0:55:3|[Tanaka] only touched the map once.
0:56:46|0:56:50|[Ban Tian] fell into contemplation and turned to look at [Zhao Yangren].
0:56:50|0:56:58|In the temple, [Yu Mancang] peeks in and observes the situation inside the hall, then sneaks into the main hall furtively, while [Hu Shuisheng] stays at the door to keep watch for him.
0:56:58|0:57:3|Approaching the incense burner cautiously after making sure it was safe, he walked towards it with great attention.
0:57:3|0:57:8|Arriving at the altar, he carefully pushed the note into the bottom of the incense burner, then pretended to leave.
0:57:9|0:57:22|When the store was empty, the monk who had been peeking through the cracks came to the altar and looked around. He then took out a piece of paper and immediately opened it to read. All of his actions were observed by [Yu Mancang], who was hiding behind a pillar in the store.
0:58:29|0:58:48|At the bamboo pavilion, the preparations are being carried out in an orderly and tense manner. Team members are fully focused on making their own weapons, and the modified landmines are handed to [He Hua] for inspection.
0:58:48|0:58:57|[He Hua] returned the landmine to his teammate, then turned and walked over to Xiulian, who was laying straw on the top of the triangular guard post, and helped fill it up with straw.
0:59:15|0:59:26|At the city gate, the Japanese army is setting off to support Zhushan. The puppet army squad is clearing the way ahead, while [Zhao Yangren] sneaks into the heavy weapons infantry column and advances together.
0:59:26|0:59:29|The whole troop, only Ban Tian rode a war horse, particularly conspicuous.
0:59:30|0:59:38|Ban Cang kept observing the large Japanese army that had just left the city gate from behind a tree. After a rough estimate, he turned and ran into the reeds.
0:59:38|0:59:47|This unit is well-equipped, with not only the most common Type 38 rifles used by the Japanese army, but also two Type 89 grenade launchers and a Type 92 heavy machine gun.
0:59:47|0:59:53|Ban Cang ran forward quickly, with the march of [Sakata] not far ahead.
0:59:53|1:0:10|Relying on the advantage of the terrain, he shuttled through the little-known paths in the reeds. Riding on horseback with a broad view of the paddy fields, and remaining highly vigilant upon entering the reed marsh, [He Hua] led the guerrillas to ambush the troops on the essential route through the paddy fields.
1:0:10|1:0:21|Without a deep understanding of the enemy and with a significant gap in equipment between the two sides, even though hiding in the dark, the team members had to focus all their attention on the direction from which the enemy forces were coming.
1:0:22|1:0:37|He Hua was getting anxious as the enemy was nowhere to be seen. After carefully observing her surroundings and finding no trace of the enemy, she quietly moved towards the sound of water to lead another ambush team. Upon reaching the water's edge, He Hua crouched down.
1:1:9|1:1:14|The Japanese troops did not notice the guerrilla fighters who had long been lying in ambush in the nearby reeds.
1:1:32|1:1:36|Seeing the enemy so close at hand and still unaware, the guerrilla fighters couldn't help but feel a bit restless.
1:1:40|1:1:48|[He Hua] calmly restrained her restless teammates, who could only watch as the enemy troops passed by them.
1:1:48|1:1:58|Seeing [He Hua] so calm, everyone could only obey orders and wait for the Japanese troops to arrive at the location full of landmines.
1:2:8|1:2:13|After Ban Tian fell off the horse without injury, [He Hua] immediately issued the evacuation order.
1:2:36|1:2:41|Zhao Yangren, though unwilling, dared not disobey the order, so he could only look at his subordinates.
1:3:7|1:3:10|The sound of gunshots frightened [Zhao Yangren], causing him to quickly run back.
1:3:36|1:3:48|The guerrilla fighters dodged shells while the puppet army squad began to search for Lu Weicong.
1:3:48|1:3:51|[Zhao Yangren] bravely shouted out loud.
1:4:44|1:4:57|[He Hua] quickly ran past [Hu Shuisheng] with two teammates towards the direction where they could intercept the [Bankfield] troops. The hurried [Bankfield] was suddenly stopped by [Zhao Yangren].
1:5:19|1:5:28|Having no interest in the guerrilla harassment at first, Commander Zhou immediately became intrigued upon hearing the name of [He Hua], and promptly ordered an investigation of the reed marsh.
1:5:28|1:5:31|Commander Zhou of the New Fourth Army issued orders immediately upon receiving intelligence from He Hua.
1:5:48|1:5:56|After receiving the order, the New Fourth Army quickly assembled to support the guerrilla team. Under the leadership of [Yu Mancang], the troops ran forward in an orderly manner.
1:5:56|1:6:0|[Hu Shuisheng] and others were suddenly stopped while dodging Japanese artillery shells.
1:7:19|1:7:25|The Japanese army led by [Ban Tian] and the puppet army squad led by [Zhao Yangren] are still searching for [He Hua] in the reed marshes.
1:7:25|1:7:40|He Hua, who couldn't find anyone after wandering around for a while, became very angry and accidentally fell to the ground while walking through the reeds.
1:7:40|1:7:45|After standing up, he ruthlessly pushed away [Zhao Yangren] who was supporting him, and turned to command his subordinates.
1:8:56|1:9:0|Ban Tian hesitated for a moment, then swung his knife towards [Zhao Yangren].
1:9:0|1:9:4|In an instant, blood splattered on the reed leaves nearby.
1:9:22|1:9:24|[He Hua] and another team member helped the wounded soldier move forward with difficulty.
1:9:34|1:9:42|He Hua settled the wounded in a hidden patch of reeds, then turned away from them and ran onto the road without any reed cover.
1:9:42|1:9:51|Seeing the approaching Japanese soldiers chasing after him, He Hua, who was hiding the wounded in the bushes, had no choice but to stop and fire his gun to distract the enemy.
1:10:3|1:10:16|[He Hua] fell to the ground and struggled to crawl forward with her injured left leg.
1:10:16|1:10:22|After firing the last bullet, she turned around and threw the gun in her hand into the lake, then continued crawling forward.
1:10:22|1:10:25|The pain in the left leg was unbearable, and a sense of weakness quickly spread throughout the body.
1:10:35|1:10:45|With only the strength left in his hands, he used the muddy grass on the shallow bank as a support point, exerting force to move his immobile body.
1:10:55|1:11:6|He Hua, who was lying unconscious on the ground, was rudely flipped over by two soldiers. They then dragged her forward by her arms, with her legs sliding on the shallow beach.
1:11:6|1:11:12|As dusk fell, the reeds that had been battling the strong wind all day had exhausted their energy and could only drift with the wind.
1:11:12|1:11:17|After successfully capturing He Hua, the Japanese soldiers, they continued to move towards the direction of the mountains.
1:11:17|1:11:20|Seeing the troops showing no signs of stopping, Translator Liang hurriedly ran towards Commander Zhou.
1:12:14|1:12:21|The Japanese communication officer ran over quickly and handed the map to [Sakata].
1:12:21|1:12:24|The two translators stepped forward to help unfold, and the two immediately started studying.
1:12:32|1:12:37|Hearing footsteps in the grass, the team members raised their rifles.
1:12:37|1:12:43|The guerrilla fighter hidden in the grass immediately let down his guard upon seeing his own people.
1:12:45|1:12:49|The New Fourth Army is running non-stop on their way to provide support.
1:12:49|1:13:2|In a thatched cottage, He Hua, bound on a stretcher, is still unconscious. Soldiers stand guard beside her. Commander Zhou and Translator Liang enter from the door. Seeing He Hua still not awake, Translator Liang says to Commander Zhou.
1:13:24|1:13:27|Upon hearing that [He Hua] was arrested, [Hu Shuisheng] completely lost his mind.
1:14:24|1:14:29|Speak up, Uncle He Hua untied the gourd wine flask from his waist and opened the spout.
1:14:29|1:14:36|After taking a lonely sip, He Hua poured the remaining wine in the lake evenly all over his body.
1:14:36|1:14:54|Look, hehe, [Translator Liang] followed [Ban Tian] into the main house and gave instructions to the guard at the door.
1:14:54|1:15:0|[Ban Tian] placed the military knife in his hand on the table and sat down smoothly, also gesturing for [Translator Liang] to sit across from him.
1:15:21|1:15:31|In the midst of confusion, a villager walked in from outside, holding a bowl of vegetables mixed with white rice, and gently placed it on the nearby table.
1:16:31|1:16:45|The uncle pretending to be drunk successfully fooled the fake soldiers guarding outside, continued to stagger towards the courtyard, then climbed lightly onto the window and looked inside.
1:16:45|1:16:59|The room full of resting Japanese soldiers startled the old man, who quickly walked towards another room. Inside the main room, [Sakata], who couldn't sleep, stared at the moon in a daze, sighed deeply, and then spoke.
1:17:16|1:17:23|Translator Liang left after receiving the order, and Yu Man Cang arrived with the New Fourth Army to meet up with Hu Shuisheng.
1:17:42|1:17:47|The uncle arrived at the house with two doorbells, and looked inside through the crack of the door.
1:17:47|1:17:54|Through the crack of the door, carefully looking for [He Hua], suddenly, a gun barrel is pressed against the back of his head.
1:18:7|1:18:11|The communication officer received the order and turned away.
1:18:11|1:18:21|The soldier guarding He Hua in the thatched cottage immediately perked up upon seeing Translator Liang.
1:18:21|1:18:26|After questioning the soldier, [Translator Liang] turned around and walked towards [He Hua], who was still groggy and strapped to a stretcher.
1:18:28|1:18:36|He slowly approached to check on He Hua's condition, seeing that she still showed no signs of waking up, he could only stand by her side and wait patiently.
1:18:36|1:18:47|The stuffy room made him fidget with his tie, and after looking around absentmindedly, he suddenly heard a sound coming from [He Hua] lying on the ground.
1:19:0|1:19:11|[He Hua] tightly closed her eyes, furrowing her brows in pain, as the soldier quickly returned with water.
1:19:11|1:19:18|Seeing the soldier squatting down to feed water to [He Hua], [Translator Liang] turned around, put away his serious expression, and walked away with some distress.
1:19:19|1:19:29|At this moment, his heart was in great turmoil. Comrades were captured by the Japanese army, and he had no idea about the movements of the reinforcements. He could only carefully protect [He Hua] in this small house.
1:19:34|1:19:43|Upon hearing [He Hua] coughing from being choked by water, he immediately turned his head to check, and after a moment realizing his inappropriate behavior, he turned back to continue fiddling with the candlestick.
1:19:43|1:19:53|He Hua understood that he had almost exposed himself due to his subconscious actions just now, so he took down the wine pot from the wall and poured alcohol into the bowl to divert attention.
1:19:53|1:20:2|With the alcohol pouring out of the bottle, his thoughts once again shifted to He Hua, who was coughing slightly on the ground, completely forgetting that his right hand was still pouring the wine.
1:20:7|1:20:16|Before he could react, the wine had already spilled onto the ground along with the moss and salt.
1:20:47|1:20:55|The soldier who was spat on by [He Hua] was about to step forward to reprimand, but was stopped by [Translator Liang] raising his hand, so he had to give up and stand back in place.
1:20:55|1:21:2|Upon seeing that [He Hua] has understood her own intentions, before leaving, [Translator Liang] once again reminded the guard soldiers.
1:21:44|1:21:44|Birds chirping.
1:21:44|1:21:45|Birds chirping.
1:21:45|1:21:45|Birds chirping.
1:21:45|1:21:46|Birds chirping.
1:21:46|1:21:47|Birds chirping.
1:22:41|1:22:43|Soldiers in the courtyard light torches.
1:22:58|1:23:2|[Tanaka] briefly pondered before expressing his thoughts.
1:23:2|1:23:7|When the troops left, [Translator Liang] was the last to board the truck.
1:23:44|1:24:3|Under the intense gunfire, the Japanese soldiers were scattered and fleeing, only [Itada] and two soldiers were able to barely fight back.
1:24:3|1:24:7|Under the suppression of machine gun fire, many Japanese soldiers fell before even stepping out of the courtyard.
1:25:2|1:25:21|In the thatched cottage, under the machine gun fire, [Translator Liang] saw that the enemy was too busy to notice him at the moment. After hesitating for a moment, he quietly slipped out from behind him.
1:25:21|1:25:29|He did not leave immediately, but instead drew his gun, turned back to make sure that Commander Zhou did not notice, and then went to find He Hua.
1:25:29|1:25:31|After being rescued by the guards, He Hua quickly untied Uncle Hu.
1:25:38|1:25:53|The two of them lifted the stretcher and walked towards the house. Just as they took a few steps, they were suddenly stopped by He Hua's voice. They saw her aiming at a wooden stake, exerting all her strength and kicking at one corner.
1:25:53|1:25:57|The three quickly evacuated, and the house was instantly ignited after the alcohol-filled candle bowl fell.
1:26:0|1:26:8|Commander Zhou picked up the binoculars and carefully observed, only to see the lights on in the thatched cottage, with thick smoke rising from the roof.
1:26:34|1:26:41|The commando completely disregarded the machine gun fire from the opposite side, quickly climbed onto the roof, set up the machine gun, and provided cover for his teammates.
1:26:41|1:26:48|Amid the shouts of the charge, countless members of the Third Squad, under the pouring rain of bullets, lifted up thatched grass for a countercharge.
1:26:48|1:26:52|Seeing the New Fourth Army soldiers falling one after another, [Hu Shuisheng] quickly leads his resistance team to fill in the gaps.
1:26:54|1:27:9|The group managed to tear open a gap in the fire net formed by the Japanese machine guns, placing thatched grass on the almost extinguished spark to reignite the fire.
1:27:9|1:27:17|The Japanese soldiers, forced out of the backyard by the fire, ran into the New Fourth Army as soon as they stepped out, turning into several bodies resembling a hornet's nest in an instant.
1:27:18|1:27:26|Ban Tian was preparing to support the soldiers when he caught sight of Translator Liang evacuating.
1:27:26|1:27:28|Batian, hit by a bullet, could only retreat back into the house.
1:27:41|1:27:51|The bugle sounded, and Commander Zhou led everyone to leap up. The escort team launched the final attack, with cannons roaring, smoke filling the air, and bullets flying.
1:27:51|1:27:58|A few minutes later, the gunfire stopped, with Japanese soldiers lying dead everywhere.
1:27:58|1:28:5|Seeing [Hu Shuisheng] leading everyone to kick open the door, Bandit Ban throws away the machine gun and retreats repeatedly, the sound of water growing louder, pressing closer step by step.
1:28:7|1:28:18|He Hua glared at Ban Tian with a murderous look in his eyes. Seeing no remorse from the other party, he took a step forward and shouted angrily.
1:28:18|1:28:30|[Ban Tian] picked up the military knife, made a drawing sword posture, and when the opponent drew the sword and charged, [Hu Shuisheng] decisively opened fire. Looking at the fallen enemy, he spoke.
1:28:31|1:28:34|[Yu Man Cang] opened his mouth and threw the sack over [Ban Tian].
1:28:34|1:28:38|Under the sunlight, the swaying reeds glistened with a radiant light.
1:28:38|1:28:55|Commander Zhou, who had finished organizing the battlefield, found Hu Shuisheng.
1:28:55|1:28:59|After hearing Hu Shuisheng's promise, Commander Zhou turned around to face the villagers.
1:29:18|1:29:25|[He Hua] is lying on a stretcher, being carried over by team members, with [Translator Liang] following closely behind with simple bandages.
1:29:25|1:29:28|Commander Zhou approached anxiously and inquired of the military doctor.
1:30:2|1:30:7|Under the command of [Commander Zhou], the New Fourth Army and the anti-Japanese guerrilla forces quickly saluted and departed.
1:30:14|1:30:20|The military medical team gradually moved away under the watchful eyes of everyone.
