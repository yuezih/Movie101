0:1:2|0:1:8|The sky was gray, and several robust Hex Maniacs flew into the valley, where thousands of monsters had gathered on the ground.
0:1:10|0:1:18|The scene fades out, entering a quiet forest.
0:1:27|0:1:33|The Old Demon Queen looked around in the bushes.
0:1:40|0:1:53|The short and fat [Pawnshop Mistress] and two followers heard a low growl, immediately stopped in their tracks. One follower said, "[Pawnshop Mistress] is fleeing in panic." The two followers glanced at each other and charged towards the two giant blood demons behind them.
0:1:53|0:1:58|One servant was thrown against a tree trunk by the Blood Demon and instantly fainted, while another was pinched unconscious on the spot.
0:1:58|0:2:4|The [Old Demon Queen] hides behind a tree, peeking out, as the Blood Demon kicks towards the follower, who cries out in pain.
0:2:4|0:2:14|[Song Tianyin] fled in a panic and stopped, facing a tall tree. She didn't know where to go. The blood demon descended from the sky, staring at [Song Tianyin], spreading its wings and making a furious roar.
0:2:14|0:2:20|[The Demon Queen] fearfully used two tentacles to block in front of her, while the little demon dragonflies flew around watching from a distance.
0:2:20|0:2:25|The [Demon Queen] was scared by the Blood Demon's roar and turned to run, but before she could take a few steps, she was caught by the Blood Demon.
0:2:26|0:2:32|The four ears of the Blood Demon shook, shooting the [Demon Queen] towards the ground, scaring the onlookers into the ground in an instant.
0:2:32|0:2:47|The demon queen was caught by the blood monster and couldn't move. She begged him and then said, "Zhu Gao suddenly appeared and pounced on the blood demon's head, tearing at the upper eyelid of the blood demon. The blood demon was furious, gritting his teeth, and reaching out with his huge palm but couldn't hit him."
0:2:52|0:2:56|Round and plump [Pang Ying] hit the Blood Demon on the head, causing the Blood Demon to be firmly smashed to the ground.
0:2:56|0:3:2|The Blood Demon shook its head and regained consciousness. Huo Xiaolan warned the Queen to be careful, and Huo Xiaolan and Pang Ying quickly fled with the Demon Queen.
0:3:2|0:3:11|The blood demon crashed into a tree and caught up. The demon queen collapsed to the ground, clutching her stomach, and gasped. The blood demon let out a triumphant roar but froze in place.
0:3:11|0:3:14|[Pang Ying] licked her lips, tossed her hair, and blew a string of kisses.
0:3:15|0:3:21|The blood demon suddenly spurted nosebleed, [Zhu Gao] saw [Pang Ying] and the blood demon flirting, immediately launched a heavy punch at the blood demon.
0:3:23|0:3:28|He said that [Zhu Gao] was bouncing to attack the Blood Demon, but was caught by the Blood Demon.
0:3:29|0:3:45|[Zhu Gao] used his four arms to forcefully hold open the blood demon's huge palm. Not far behind the blood demon were four narrow-spaced trees. [Pang Ying] spun rapidly and rammed into the blood demon's belly. The blood demon grunted and fell backwards, getting stuck perfectly between the four trees.
0:3:47|0:3:51|[Zhu Gao] hurriedly protected the demon queen and fled, while the blood demon was trapped in the tree and unable to escape.
0:3:51|0:3:56|Above the forest, the little demon [Bamboo Dragonfly] furrowed its brow and flew off into the distance.
0:4:0|0:4:8|The green tentacles on the ground form the characters of the movie title "Monster Hunt". [Huo Xiaolan] slowly gets up from the ground.
0:4:8|0:4:19|Four trees beside have collapsed, with their roots exposed, the scene cuts to Yongyun Village.
0:4:56|0:4:58|Xiao Wu was also thrown out by Aunt Li.
0:5:7|0:5:15|As they were talking, a pile of clothes was thrown onto the two of them, and inside the house, [Song Tianyin] and [Xiao Wu] happily folded the clothes.
0:5:20|0:5:27|[Song Tianyin] adjusted the brace on his right leg and limped into the inner room.
0:5:50|0:5:56|He blocked the sticks with a carrying pole.
0:6:57|0:7:15|After [Grandma] left, [Song Tianyin] immediately turned around and slammed the door in frustration. In the center of the ancient city, a towering square pagoda-style building stood out conspicuously, with a magnificent and intricate structure, appearing mysterious and solemn. [Ge Qianhu] touched his eyebrows in front of a bronze mirror and smiled with satisfaction.
0:7:15|0:7:22|The little demon dragonfly by the side immediately flew away.
0:7:31|0:7:36|A small copper chair followed [Ge Qianhu] obediently, stopping when signaled.
0:7:55|0:8:2|The maid served the standing chefs with wine glasses. The chefs nodded in thanks, but [Ge Qianhu] felt a bit uncomfortable sitting in the chair.
0:8:2|0:8:10|He pursed his lips, turned his head, and glared, and the chair immediately rose significantly upon receiving the command.
0:8:34|0:8:43|The chefs were drinking, [Ge Qianhu] looked around at everyone. By the green river, [Song Tianyin] was boredly throwing stones into the water.
0:8:50|0:9:4|Transformed into human form, [Pang Ying] saw [Song Tianyin], dressed in pink sand, holding a daisy as she walked towards [Song Tianyin], getting close to his chest and intoxicatedly sniffing it.
0:9:6|0:9:12|[Pang Ying] glanced at [Song Tianyin] and walked around him in a circle.
0:10:5|0:10:26|Not far away, the bamboo dragonfly wanted to catch up with them. The three of them walked into [Song Tianyin]'s small house. [Song Tianyin] tied [Zhu Gao]'s donkey to the door pillar outside the house. [Zhu Gao], behind [Pang Ying], struggled to carry the basket. [Zhu Gao] quickly moved aside with the basket, not allowing [Song Tianyin] to help.
0:10:29|0:10:34|[Huo Xiaolan] walked in with a fierce look, staring straight at [Pang Ying] and the others.
0:10:34|0:10:40|[Zhu Gao]'s face twitched quickly, and [Huo Xiaolan] stared at the two of them, lifting his robe and sitting down boldly.
0:10:41|0:10:47|He had two copper coins strung together with red thread hanging on his chest, and [Pang Ying] looked away disdainfully.
0:10:47|0:11:6|Song Tianyin walked in with a teapot at this moment, nodded and smiled at Huo Xiaolan. Pang Ying and Huo Xiaolan were stunned, while Huo Xiaolan looked at them calmly. Pang Ying and Zhu Gao exchanged glances.
0:11:6|0:11:10|At this moment, [Song Tianyin] suddenly clapped his hands.
0:11:12|0:11:16|[Huo Xiaolan] looked at [Song Tianyin] as if he were a fool, [Song Tianyin] smiled awkwardly, while [Zhu Gao] chuckled without saying a word.
0:11:24|0:11:32|[Zhu Gao] threw the slingshot in his hand, and it flew around the house, closing all the windows and doors.
0:11:45|0:11:51|Huo Xiaolan flew straight towards [Huo Xiaolan]. [Huo Xiaolan] dodged, and then [Pang Ying] and [Huo Xiaolan] began to fight fiercely.
0:11:59|0:12:3|[Pang Ying] stood on the roof with her hands in a claw-like position, her bones creaking.
0:12:3|0:12:12|[Huo Xiaolan] whipped the whip and firmly tied up [Pang Ying], who fell heavily to the ground.
0:12:12|0:12:17|[Zhu Gao] quickly took out the chopsticks from the chopstick tube and threw them at [Huo Xiaolan]. [Huo Xiaolan] easily blocked them.
0:12:20|0:12:29|[Huo Xiaolan] flew around a pillar, threw out a whip tied to [Zhu Gao], and [Zhu Gao] could only swing along with it.
0:12:31|0:12:37|[Zhu Gao] was stabbed and fell to the ground in pain, while [Song Tianyin] fled in panic.
0:12:46|0:12:54|[Zhu Gao] bumped [Huo Xiaolan], making her step back several times. He smirked slyly, took off his human skin, revealing his true form of a tall and skinny green leaf.
0:13:2|0:13:10|[Pang Ying] also shed her human skin, instantly transforming back into the short and chubby Pang Ying, with red leaves in her hair, looking adorable and naive.
0:13:27|0:13:35|[Zhu Gao] suddenly kisses [Pang Ying], seeing this, [Huo Xiaolan] turns her head and uses a whip to separate the two demons.
0:13:43|0:13:58|[Huo Xiaolan] was knocked back, [Zhu Gao] rapidly struck [Huo Xiaolan], [Huo Xiaolan] then lunged forward and kicked down [Zhu Gao].
0:14:5|0:14:20|Then carefully sniffing the scent on Song Tianyin, seeming curious about him, Song Tianyin, however, dared not move at all, while Zhu Gao firmly pressed down on Huo Xiaolan.
0:14:25|0:14:37|He was immobilized, [Pang Ying] lunged at [Huo Xiaolan] but she dodged, and [Pang Ying] took away the talisman.
0:14:49|0:14:58|[Song Tianyin] raised his hands above his head and slowly walked out, with the demon queen holding a stick behind him. [Luo Gang] suddenly attacked the demon queen, and [Huo Xiaolan] immediately blocked him.
0:14:58|0:15:3|The demon queen sprayed [Song Tianyin] in the face with water before breaking through the door and escaping.
0:15:12|0:15:18|[Song Tianyin] cautiously lifted the stool closer to [Huo Xiaolan].
0:15:44|0:16:4|[Huo Xiaolan] turned to look at him with a sly smile, reaching towards her neck with her left hand as if to peel off someone's skin. She forcefully kicked her legs, signaling to [Song Tianyin] to put down the stool, and [Song Tianyin] obediently complied.
0:16:19|0:16:27|[Song Tianyin] was frightened and staggered away silently, while [Huo Xiaolan] brandished a knife and threatened. [Song Tianyin], with a fearful expression, nodded vigorously and limped away.
0:16:34|0:16:41|[Huo Xiaolan] looked at herself in the mirror with satisfaction, while smoke still rose from the village at night. Inside the house, [Huo Xiaolan] slurped the noodles in her bowl.
0:16:58|0:17:8|[Huo Xiaolan] looked up at [Song Tianyin], who quickly suppressed his smile. [Huo Xiaolan] continued to eat her noodles with her head down, while [Song Tianyin] sat down disheartenedly and watched her.
0:17:22|0:17:29|[Song Tianyin] was startled and picked up his chopsticks to pick up some food. [Huo Xiaolan] slammed the table and warned him with her eyes not to touch it.
0:17:31|0:17:43|[Song Tianyin] got up with a sense of grievance and left. [Huo Xiaolan] raised her eyes, supported her chin with her hand, and looked at him with a smile.
0:17:52|0:18:4|Night falls over the village, inside the house, [Song Tianyin] tries to touch [Huo Xiaolan] but is slapped away.
0:18:4|0:18:12|[Huo Xiaolan] pushes [Song Tianyin] down, [Song Tianyin] shyly tries to undo his clothes, but his hands are tied by [Huo Xiaolan], who smirks and wraps a rope around [Song Tianyin]'s wrists.
0:18:14|0:18:22|[Song Tianyin] watched [Huo Xiaolan] eagerly twisting to the side with a shy smile, but unexpectedly his feet were tightly bound.
0:18:22|0:18:29|The upper room of the bed has already set up a net with bells attached, [Huo Xiaolan] is bending over and laughing foolishly next to the door.
0:18:33|0:18:38|[Huo Xiaolan] suddenly turned fierce, then quickly put on a smile, pouting as if she was going to kiss him.
0:18:38|0:18:43|She quickly wiped [Song Tianyin]'s mouth, which had been firmly sealed by her.
0:18:53|0:18:57|[Huo Xiaolan] explained and then turned over to sleep, ignoring him.
0:18:57|0:19:9|[Song Tianyin] struggled to look at his toes, realizing he was tied up tightly. Under the ancient tree, a person was resting against a rock, with a pile of bonfire in front of them.
0:19:9|0:19:13|[Luo Gang] untied the cloth bundle and picked up the piece of dry food inside, gazing at it.
0:19:15|0:19:20|After some thought, he broke the dry rations into two pieces, which made Pang Ying and Zhu Gao beside him drool with desire.
0:19:20|0:19:26|[Luo Gang] looked at the dry rations, put half of them in his pocket, and started enjoying the other half.
0:19:26|0:19:37|He watched the two little demons while chewing, and the two little demons suddenly sang out loud in frustration with their heads down.
0:22:9|0:22:17|In [Song Tianyin]'s small house, two people were sleeping soundly. A small knife was quietly sawing the wooden board under [Song Tianyin] while he was asleep, seemingly disturbing [Huo Xiaolan].
0:22:17|0:22:22|She turned over with a frown, crossing her arms to go back to sleep.
0:22:23|0:22:38|The knife paused for a moment before resuming work. [Song Tianyin] leaned over and bumped into the knife, instantly waking up. He looked sideways and observed behind him. The knife suddenly accelerated wildly, as he tried to wake up [Huo Xiaolan], but the bed beneath him began to sink.
0:22:39|0:22:48|[Huo Xiaolan] rubbed her face with her arm, but she didn't wake up. [Song Tianyin] sank to the bottom, staring with wide eyes but unable to make a sound, only to be dragged into the darkness.
0:22:50|0:22:57|The light gradually came in, [Song Tianyin] was being dragged forward.
0:22:57|0:23:2|The demon queen dragged it out of the cave entrance, and [Song Tianyin] opened his eyes to observe the surroundings.
0:23:2|0:23:12|He looked around blankly with his mouth closed, as the demon queen pushed him against the tree trunk and used her claws to remove the curse on his mouth. [Song Tianyin] quickly opened his mouth wide to breathe in the air.
0:23:14|0:23:23|The demon queen held his hand, caressing her own swollen belly slowly and raised her eyes to say:
0:23:32|0:23:48|While the demon queen was talking, she used her claws to cut open the belly, causing [Song Tianyin] to lose control of his expression in fear. Reluctantly, the demon queen extended her tentacles to open his mouth, glanced at the dragon egg, and then stuffed the egg into his mouth.
0:23:48|0:23:57|Song Tianyin's belly quickly swelled, and the usually gentle demon queen suddenly showed her fangs.
0:23:57|0:24:12|Behind the tree, there is a huge blood demon, roaring low and swinging its giant fists. The demon queen shows no fear, snarls back, then bravely rushes forward, crazily scratching the blood demon, only to be knocked away, falling to the ground along with Song Tianyin.
0:24:13|0:24:19|The blood demon leaped into the air, about to deliver a heavy blow to the two, but [Huo Xiaolan] used a spell to confuse the blood demon.
0:24:21|0:24:27|[Huo Xiaolan] ran forward and delivered a beautiful flying kick, causing the Blood Demon to stagger back, then she took out two talismans.
0:24:29|0:24:41|The blood demon's forelimbs were restrained, [Huo Xiaolan] raised her eyebrows triumphantly. The blood demon violently swung its huge tail, almost hitting [Huo Xiaolan]. Its forelimbs broke free from the spell and viciously pounced towards [Huo Xiaolan].
0:24:41|0:24:47|[Huo Xiaolan] tied the big tree with a whip, dodging attacks agilely. She leaped under the tree, making the Blood Demon very angry.
0:24:48|0:24:55|The blood demon wanted to leave, but was caught by a whip flying in, [Huo Xiaolan] used a tree trunk to fix the whip and made the blood demon fall flat on the ground.
0:24:58|0:25:7|The demon queen cut the rope on [Song Tianyin]'s hand, held his hand, and let him gently stroke her belly.
0:25:11|0:25:16|After the witch queen lost her strength and hung her head, [Song Tianyin] shook her vigorously but received no response.
0:25:16|0:25:34|At this moment, [Huo Xiaolan] was being beaten by the blood demon and struggling to catch her breath. [Song Tianyin] quickly picked up the whip from the ground to throw it to her, but it got tangled around his neck. [Huo Xiaolan] shouted and fiercely stabbed the blood demon's head with her hand, and the blood demon swung its fist.
0:25:34|0:25:40|[Huo Xiaolan] landed in agony after hitting a tree trunk hard, as the Blood Demon closed in on [Song Tianyin], knocking him down with a slap.
0:25:40|0:25:51|[Huo Xiaolan] pulled out a knife, swept away the demon, and grabbed [Song Tianyin]'s leg, lifting him into the air. [Song Tianyin] screamed in terror: [Huo Xiaolan] rushed forward and fiercely stabbed the knife into the blood demon's tail.
0:25:52|0:25:57|[Song Tianyin] fell to the ground, and Blood Demon quickly checked his tail. When he turned back, the two had already escaped.
0:25:58|0:26:2|They rushed towards the entrance they had just come from, slipping in just before the blood demon pounced.
0:26:3|0:26:10|The Blood Demon's head was stuck in the cave entrance and couldn't get out. He reached out to scratch an itch, but accidentally touched the wound on his tail, helplessly lying paralyzed on the ground.
0:26:10|0:26:24|In the village, everyone is busy and peaceful. [Ge Qianhu] rides a white horse, grandly entering the village with a few chefs following behind. The villagers curiously watch.
0:26:26|0:26:32|Xiao Wu looked around, not knowing the identity of the person. As night fell, Song Tianyin and Luo Gang crawled out of the bed cave exhausted.
0:26:32|0:26:40|[Song Tianyin] approached [Huo Xiaolan] with a big belly and asked. [Huo Xiaolan] leaned in to listen to his belly, furrowing her brow.
0:27:7|0:27:15|[Huo Xiaolan] brought a straw shoe to his mouth, [Song Tianyin] bit the shoe head in confusion, and [Huo Xiaolan] drew a knife towards his neck.
0:27:41|0:27:45|Song Tianyin struggled to get up with her belly, while Huo Xiaolan satisfactorily sheathed the knife.
0:27:52|0:28:1|[Huo Xiaolan] just stepped in and triggered the mechanism on the floor. Darts flew all over the room. She quickly dodged the darts, but before she could steady herself, she was caught in a big net and lifted up to the ceiling.
0:28:5|0:28:12|[Huo Xiaolan] grinned as she pulled the net.
0:28:25|0:28:30|[Song Tianyin] left alone with the sack, leaving [Huo Xiaolan] hanging in mid-air, gasping for breath.
0:28:47|0:28:54|The door slowly opens, the camera moves down, and a green little demon looks at her.
0:29:8|0:29:18|Chef Tian Shi suddenly appeared with a hammer in hand and knocked down Xiao Wu. He used an electric hammer to strike Xiao Wu heavily, sending him flying into the air before crashing back down.
0:29:18|0:29:25|[Song Tianyin] hides behind the wooden frame, peeking and feeling guilty as his eyes meet Xiao Wu's.
0:29:29|0:29:34|Chef Tian Shi approached [Xiao Wu] and carefully examined him, while [Song Tianyin] took the opportunity to leave quietly.
0:29:35|0:29:42|In the room, [Huo Xiaolan] is chanting in the net, and a red paper doll like a window flower emerges from under her body.
0:29:42|0:29:47|The paper figures called out to their friends and climbed up the big net together.
0:29:47|0:29:56|They giggled like children as they climbed to the top of the big net.
0:29:57|0:30:11|The scene cuts to outside the house, with [Song Tianyin] peeking behind the wall at the gathered villagers, while [Ge Qianhu] sighs in front of the villagers.
0:31:20|0:31:30|[Ge Qianhu] pointed the sword handle at the monster. The Pawnshop Mistress smiled and said. A fart popped out of the mistress's mouth, letting out a loud, smoky fart.
0:31:30|0:31:36|She, already transformed into a demon, burst into laughter, and the villagers all laughed heartily.
0:31:36|0:31:45|Ge Qianhu's henchman released a yellow and black beetle, and the scorpion crawled up the villager's pointed head along his fingertips.
0:31:47|0:31:52|The Fire Beetle pierced the villager's temple with its pincers, causing the villager to fall to the ground, with half of his head already transformed into a demon.
0:31:52|0:31:59|The fire beetle crawled slowly out of the wound on his head, and when Song Tianyin exclaimed, Huo Xiaolan covered his mouth.
0:32:10|0:32:14|His henchmen approached the villagers with weapons, and they used torches to set fire to the plaques and beams in the village.
0:32:20|0:32:36|[Song Tianyin] and [Xiao Wu] watched from the shadows as the villagers were taken away by the celestial masters. [Xiao Wu] fell behind the group and was kicked by Fire Celestial Master for slowing down.
0:33:4|0:33:12|[Song Tianyin], with a big belly and carrying heavy luggage, limped behind [Huo Xiaolan] as they walked out of the village where he was born and raised.
0:33:18|0:33:26|After crossing the river, he stood at the bridgehead, looked back at the houses in the village still emitting smoke, and then turned away.
0:33:26|0:33:52|The scene shows a map-like view, with two people walking side by side on a mountain road among towering mountains. After trekking through mountains and rivers, the two arrive at an inn to rest, and a high empty bowl is placed in front of [Song Tianyin].
0:33:56|0:34:4|The shopkeeper picked up a bowl of noodles and walked over.
0:34:11|0:34:20|[Huo Xiaolan] awkwardly smiled at the shopkeeper, but then widened her eyes as she turned her head. Outside the inn, [Luo Gang] was leisurely strolling over, while [Song Tianyin] looked at [Huo Xiaolan] in shock.
0:34:26|0:34:41|[Song Tianyin] buried himself in eating, [Huo Xiaolan] gave him a hard pat, and he left with his mouth full of noodles. [Huo Xiaolan] gestured for him to go left, and he picked up his luggage and squatted to leave. [Luo Gang] walked into the shop, glanced at [Huo Xiaolan], was about to turn and rush out of the shop, but was stopped by [Huo Xiaolan].
0:35:28|0:35:39|[Huo Xiaolan] decisively leaves, [Luo Gang] can only sit down at the table, but he notices a stack of empty bowls on the table. Mocking [Song Tianyin]'s belly.
0:35:39|0:35:47|But he still just kept eating, [Huo Xiaolan] ran over to see [Song Tianyin], and angrily patted his back.
0:36:5|0:36:13|[Huo Xiaolan] pulled [Song Tianyin] away in a hurry, with [Luo Gang] following closely with a wicked smile. [Luo Gang] threw the axe towards the two, causing the wooden pole inside the house to collapse.
0:36:14|0:36:18|The crowd began to scatter in panic, [Huo Xiaolan] turned around to see [Luo Gang] holding an axe to [Song Tianyin]'s neck.
0:36:19|0:36:23|At this moment, [Huo Xiaolan] flew up and kicked, causing [Luo Gang] to hold his leg and howl in pain.
0:36:23|0:36:33|Luo Gang soared up to fight with Huo Xiaolan, while Song Tianyin, caught in between the two, was repeatedly injured.
0:36:46|0:36:50|[Luo Gang] turned his head, [Huo Xiaolan] took the opportunity to hit him, but he saw through her plan, and [Song Tianyin] quickly covered her.
0:36:50|0:36:56|[Huo Xiaolan] kicked [Luo Gang] away, then helped [Song Tianyin] up and shielded him behind her.
0:37:0|0:37:5|The rooftop blood demon landed with a bang, aiming to attack [Luo Gang], who was kicked away and crashed through the courtyard wall.
0:37:5|0:37:14|[Huo Xiaolan] was swinging a whip to attack the blood demon, but he threw her aside and broke the table. [Luo Gang] woke up in the mess and saw the blood demon approaching [Huo Xiaolan].
0:37:15|0:37:38|[Song Tianyin] rushed forward and used his foot to resist the Blood Demon's giant palm. Veins popped on his face, and the protective gear on his leg was shattered by brute force. [Huo Xiaolan] quickly got up and exerted force together. Turning to [Luo Gang] for help, he said, "With one strong push from the Blood Demon, the two instantly collapsed." [Luo Gang] broke through the roof and landed behind the Blood Demon, using a net to control its head.
0:37:38|0:37:53|[Huo Xiaolan] supported [Song Tianyin] and staggered backward, saying directly: She pulled [Song Tianyin] and fled towards the courtyard.
0:37:58|0:38:21|[Huo Xiaolan] turned around and, after speaking, dragged [Song Tianyin] away. The Blood Demon was jumping around in the courtyard, causing chaos everywhere. [Luo Gang] shouted in anger: the Blood Demon was beaten up, with a swollen nose and bruised face, teeth scattered on the ground. He covered his face with his claws, whimpering as he moved away. When he saw [Luo Gang] raising an axe, he immediately flapped and fled.
0:38:21|0:38:34|And the camera turns to the front of [Luo Gang], half of his face swollen high, as he slowly lowers the axe and collapses with a bang.
0:38:34|0:38:41|The sun was glaring in the mountains and fields, with [Song Tianyin] and [Huo Xiaolan] sitting on the carriage like a married couple.
0:38:41|0:38:49|[Song Tianyin] was whistling while sewing clothes when suddenly he had a morning sickness reaction, [Huo Xiaolan] quickly patted his back.
0:38:49|0:39:1|The flock of sheep suddenly appeared not far away at this moment, the scenery in the mountain night was pleasant, and the map suddenly appeared, the next stop is Shuntian Mansion.
0:39:12|0:39:18|In the hall, after [Pang Ying] and [Zhu Gao] withdrew their gazes, they smiled at each other.
0:39:34|0:39:40|[Huo Xiaolan] walked out of the room gracefully, while [Song Tianyin] leaned against the bed, rubbing his stomach.
0:39:42|0:39:49|[Huo Xiaolan] sat down in the lobby and said to the waiter: "A cute little kid suddenly appeared,"
0:40:47|0:40:58|[Huo Xiaolan] looked around at the chefs surrounding her, each adorned with many copper coins. Silently, [Huo Xiaolan] put away the only two copper coins she had on her, while [Song Tianyin] lay on the side inside the room.
0:40:58|0:41:4|Moaning and clutching his stomach, he rolled over and immediately [Pang Ying] and [Zhu Gao] behind him hid away.
0:41:4|0:41:8|Song Tianyin writhed in pain, while Pang Ying and the others approached with joy on their faces.
0:41:8|0:41:15|[Song Tianyin] was shocked to see the two of them, [Zhu Gao] knocked [Song Tianyin] unconscious with a slap, and the two of them were about to carry him out the door.
0:41:21|0:41:23|[Huo Xiaolan] stood at the door and swiftly used a talisman to immobilize the two of them.
0:41:24|0:41:38|[Huo Xiaolan] locked the two of them in the cabinet, quickly waking up [Song Tianyin]. [Huo Xiaolan] vigilantly looked outside the door, while [Song Tianyin] struggled to sit up, only to be hit by a wave of pain that made him grit his teeth and groan.
0:41:57|0:42:4|Song Tianyin struggled to prop himself up in pain, while Huo Xiaolan rushed to the door but then turned back.
0:42:8|0:42:16|[Huo Xiaolan] was so anxious that she scratched her head, while the demon egg in her belly was tossing and turning, making [Song Tianyin] roll back and forth in distress.
0:42:25|0:42:30|[Huo Xiaolan] brought hot water and a bundle of scissors, professionally wiping the sweat off [Song Tianyin].
0:42:48|0:42:55|[Song Tianyin] winced in pain, his features all scrunched up.
0:42:55|0:43:1|[Huo Xiaolan] knelt at the foot of the bed, supporting [Song Tianyin]'s legs and unbuttoning his pants.
0:43:9|0:43:17|[Huo Xiaolan] approached [Song Tianyin] but couldn't bear to look directly at him, she squinted again under the burlap to search.
0:43:30|0:43:35|[Huo Xiaolan] buried her head in the blanket, holding the scissors close to herself.
0:43:44|0:43:48|[Song Tianyin] suddenly took a deep breath and bit his finger hard.
0:43:56|0:44:3|[Zheng Tao] and Mrs. Zheng, holding Niu Niu, arrived at the door.
0:44:15|0:44:20|Mrs. Zheng pushed the door open a crack.
0:44:55|0:45:1|[Song Tianyin] tilted his head back and spat out an egg-shaped object from his mouth, while [Huo Xiaolan] knocked out Mrs. Zheng who was about to speak with a single palm strike.
0:45:1|0:45:5|The egg-shaped object bounces in four places inside the house.
0:45:5|0:45:14|It dodged Huo Xiaolan, who was waiting under the chair, then popped out its little legs and tail, ran towards the door but was knocked down.
0:45:14|0:45:18|[Huo Xiaolan] lifted its tail and observed it carefully.
0:45:18|0:45:24|A egg-shaped object with four tentacles and a baby-like head covered in green leaves emerges.
0:45:26|0:45:34|[Huo Xiaolan] carried it into the room with one hand, the cute little demon king blinked its eyes innocently.
0:45:34|0:45:48|Tianyin turned to ask [Huo Xiaolan], and [Huo Xiaolan] reluctantly said, "[Huo Xiaolan] tentatively reached out with her index finger to touch the little demon king's hand."
0:45:48|0:45:53|The little demon king suddenly spat water on her shoulder.
0:45:54|0:45:57|Outside the door, the inquiries made [Song Tianyin] and the other person look at each other.
0:46:50|0:46:57|[Song Tianyin] quickly learned two cries of a baby and called for [Zhu Gao] to be dragged into the room.
0:47:4|0:47:11|At this moment, [Niu Jieshi] is squatting in the house playing with the little demon king.
0:47:11|0:47:20|He suddenly slapped towards the little demon king, [Song Tianyin] rushed up to quickly grab [Niu Jieshi], then turned around, and the little demon king had disappeared without a trace.
0:47:21|0:47:29|[Niu Jieshi] lay on his back, tightly holding onto the tail of the Little Demon King as he was dragged around, while [Song Tianyin] crawled closely behind but was bumped into the bed frame.
0:47:30|0:47:40|[Niu Jieshi] was stopped by [Song Tianyin] as he picked up the scissors. In the struggle, the scissors were accidentally flung and landed right on [Pang Ying]'s right shoulder.
0:47:40|0:47:49|[Zhu Gao] was heartbroken when he saw it, his face twitching. He didn't expect [Song Tianyin] to immediately throw a pair of scissors that stabbed into his chest.
0:47:51|0:47:58|The little demon king dragged [Niu Jieshi] up to the roof beam, [Song Tianyin] panicked, and [Zheng Tao] smiled reassuringly.
0:47:58|0:48:7|[Song Tianyin] placed a chair on the table and climbed onto the roof beam. [Niu Jieshi] threw the little demon king onto a distant beam, then walked alone to the middle of the roof beam.
0:48:8|0:48:17|Outside the house, [Zheng Tao] stared at the dark figure climbing on the rafters.
0:48:18|0:48:22|[Huo Xiaolan] immediately used acupressure to make her faint.
0:48:25|0:48:30|[Song Tianyin] accidentally slipped from the beam, and [Niu Jieshi] intercepted the little demon king on the beam.
0:48:30|0:48:39|The frightened little demon king ran back and forth on the beams, accidentally stepping on Song Tianyin's arm and bumping into Luo Gang's leg.
0:48:39|0:48:51|[Song Tianyin] climbed back onto the rafters with effort, [Niu Jieshi] bounced on the rafters, gradually moving towards the center beam. [Song Tianyin] stealthily approached him.
0:48:51|0:48:57|[Niu Jieshi] suddenly slipped and fell, [Song Tianyin] quickly grabbed him, and the two of them were hanging upside down on the beam.
0:48:58|0:49:6|Song Tianyin's feet were cushioned by a sturdy cowhide as he fell to the ground, Zheng Tao rushed towards the door upon hearing the noise.
0:49:7|0:49:12|[Song Tianyin] quickly handed [Niu Jieshi] to him and closed the door, while [Huo Xiaolan] watched as [Zheng Tao] carried [Niu Jieshi] away.
0:49:13|0:49:21|[Song Tianyin] sat panting next to the door, and the little demon king ran over to lean against him, creating a warm scene.
0:49:21|0:49:30|By the sheep pen at night, people were whispering to each other.
0:49:40|0:49:53|[Pang Ying] and [Zhu Gao] blinked crazily. [Song Tianyin] and [Huo Xiaolan] continued on their journey with their luggage, arriving at an abandoned stone house where [Huo Xiaolan] pushed open the door.
0:49:54|0:50:8|Sunlight streamed into the room, illuminating the deity on the stone wall. [Song Tianyin] opened the swaddle, revealing the little demon king in his arms with tightly closed eyes.
0:50:9|0:50:15|He hurriedly ran towards [Huo Xiaolan], who took the little demon king and touched its forehead.
0:50:17|0:50:24|Song Tianyin hurriedly pulled out a piece of blue cloth from the luggage and handed it over.
0:50:26|0:50:38|He hurried to the water pool inside and fetched water, putting a wet cloth on the head of [Xiao Yaowang], immediately steam rose up.
0:50:38|0:50:51|Song Tianyin paced back and forth between the pool and the bed, while Huo Xiaolan wrung out the linen to apply to the little demon king's head. The little demon king suddenly spat saliva on it.
0:50:54|0:51:0|The little demon king slowly opened his eyes, and [Huo Xiaolan] smiled with relief.
0:51:2|0:51:9|[Song Tianyin] sat next to the weak little demon king and made a funny face at it.
0:51:14|0:51:20|Song Tianyin's squinted eyes made the little demon king giggle, while Huo Xiaolan looked at the playful Song Tianyin thoughtfully.
0:51:20|0:51:29|At this moment, the little demon king was drowsy, and [Huo Xiaolan] gestured to [Song Tianyin] to stop making any noise. Soon, the little demon king fell into a deep sleep.
0:51:29|0:51:31|[Song Tianyin] and [Huo Xiaolan] gazed quietly at it.
0:51:32|0:51:40|Outside the house, two horses were basking lazily in the sun, while inside the house, the little demon king was making gestures at the edge of the bed in his sleep.
0:51:40|0:51:50|Three little paper-cut figures were sitting at the foot of the bed, and the little demon king accidentally fell off the bed.
0:51:50|0:51:56|[Song Tianyin] rushed over and hugged it, while [Huo Xiaolan] touched its head and said:
0:52:39|0:52:53|[Huo Xiaolan] took the little demon king and held him in her arms, taking a deep breath. [Song Tianyin] turned around and smiled with relief.
0:52:53|0:53:2|[Huo Xiaolan] saw the window paper-cut figures crowding around and ordered them to disperse, [Huo Xiaolan] frowned in worry.
0:53:2|0:53:8|Suddenly, her eyes lit up with an idea, and she turned around and said:
0:53:22|0:53:33|She suddenly opened [Song Tianyin]'s clothes, allowing the little demon king to suck blood, and the screams of [Song Tianyin] could be heard outside the house. Mrs. Zheng sat in the moving sedan chair, with a vacant look in her eyes, saying:
0:53:58|0:54:15|He saw [Luo Gang] with four broken copper coins hanging from his chest, a slight smile on his lips. The midday sun shone through the leaves as [Song Tianyin] picked wild fruits in the woods, tasting them as he picked.
0:54:18|0:54:24|The camera cuts to two horses falling to the ground, with [Huo Xiaolan] standing with crossed arms on the side saying:
0:54:27|0:54:50|The little demon king turned his tentacles to please and accompany with a smile. [Song Tianyin] and [Huo Xiaolan] both glared at it angrily. It took small steps forward in a pitiful manner. [Song Tianyin] patiently crouched down and instructed it, "The little demon king pouted and curled up into an egg shape on the spot."
0:55:22|0:55:35|The little demon obediently ate the wild fruit, looking very happy. It happily ate the second fruit, as [Song Tianyin] looked at the horse and said.
0:55:37|0:55:45|[Song Tianyin] kept feeding the little demon king wild fruits, causing the little demon king's cheeks to puff up. [Song Tianyin] watched with a big smile on his face.
0:55:45|0:55:52|It suddenly shot a wild fruit from its mouth, hitting a hole in the pillar on the lawn.
0:55:54|0:56:3|Its mouth sprayed wild fruits like a machine gun, [Song Tianyin] hid beside [Huo Xiaolan], and the thatched pavilion collapsed with a bang.
0:56:3|0:56:14|[Huo Xiaolan] stood with hands on hips, looking at [Song Tianyin]. [Song Tianyin] quietly withdrew his hand as the little demon king laughed heartily. The two of them gazed at it in silence.
0:56:14|0:56:20|Upon entering the stone cave, Huo Xiaolan danced and played with the little demon king and the window flower little people.
0:56:20|0:56:28|[Huo Xiaolan] is wiping the peach-shaped object on the stone table. The peach is yellow all over with branch-like patterns on its surface.
0:56:28|0:56:34|[Song Tianyin] curiously walked up to her and sat down.
0:57:2|0:57:9|The mischievous little demon king suddenly stopped playing and looked at [Huo Xiaolan]. [Song Tianyin] recalled:
0:57:34|0:57:45|The little demon king quickly stole a piece of cloth from the table. [Huo Xiaolan] noticed and scolded it, while [Song Tianyin] pointed at the peach heart and reached out his hand.
0:57:46|0:57:54|[Huo Xiaolan] handed it to him with half belief, and [Song Tianyin] took the peach heart and blew on it.
0:57:55|0:58:6|The little demon king trembling in the corner is absolutely adorable when he needs to relieve himself.
0:58:44|0:58:52|The little demon king still refused to eat the pear fed to him by [Song Tianyin]. [Huo Xiaolan] brought [Song Tianyin]'s hand to its mouth, and just as it was about to bite, it saw [Song Tianyin]'s expression and closed its mouth.
0:59:38|0:59:44|The little demon king slept between [Song Tianyin] and [Huo Xiaolan], lifting [Huo Xiaolan]'s hand and covering it with [Song Tianyin]'s hand.
0:59:45|0:59:49|The night was quiet in the valley.
0:59:49|0:59:54|The river in Shuntian Mansion twists and turns, with houses and buildings lined up in order.
1:0:0|1:0:9|In front of the Hongyun Teahouse, bustling with noise and excitement, a parade is passing by, with a person carrying a huge horn and wearing a painted mask.
1:0:9|1:0:17|The person dressed in fringe all over the body as a crane, walking on stilts and waving his arms, while the little demon king in the basket watches them through the cracks.
1:0:18|1:0:26|[Huo Xiaolan] and [Song Tianyin] walked beside the team, looking around. They walked one after the other in the market.
1:0:26|1:0:34|[Song Tianyin] walked by and saw the children sitting at a roadside stall, showing off as they ate sugar paintings.
1:0:34|1:0:41|He thought for a moment and couldn't help but look at the little demon king in the basket. [Huo Xiaolan] patted [Song Tianyin] and gestured for him to hurry.
1:1:5|1:1:18|The Pawnshop Mistress looked under the table again, but the bald men were swapping cards on the table. She picked up a card, saw the pattern on it, and smugly added it to her own hand.
1:1:19|1:1:24|Three bald men are celebrating, while [Huo Xiaolan] and [Song Tianyin] are watching on the side.
1:1:25|1:1:32|The Pawnshop Mistress noticed the bald men avoiding eye contact and went to check the cards on the table.
1:1:35|1:1:40|All three bald men extended their hands, each holding up four hands with mahjong tiles hanging from their sleeves on the table.
1:1:42|1:1:48|Three bald men with ankle chains were reluctant to go upstairs, [Huo Xiaolan] deliberately coughed.
1:1:52|1:1:57|The Pawnshop Mistress raised her eyebrows and turned around to see the two copper coins on Huo Xiaolan's chest, instantly a smile appeared on her face.
1:1:57|1:2:6|[Song Tianyin] placed the little demon king in front of the Pawnshop Mistress.
1:2:8|1:2:24|The Pawnshop Mistress opened the wanted poster which described the features of the demon fetus: round head, pointed ears, golden eyes, covered with moss on top, and so on.
1:2:24|1:2:30|[Song Tianyin] smiled and picked up the little demon king, but the Pawnshop Mistress hurriedly stopped him.
1:2:36|1:2:54|The pawnshop mistress looked at him in disbelief, then casually said: She used a fan to mark a spot, then walked out of the room and closed the iron door. Huo Xiaolan extended her arms to Song Tianyin.
1:2:58|1:3:1|She rolled her eyes and put down her arms.
1:3:1|1:3:10|Song Tianyin looked at the little demon king in his arms and said regretfully. Huo Xiaolan lowered her eyes and stretched out her arms.
1:3:11|1:3:19|Huo Xiaolan deftly turned around as the little demon king reached out his tentacles to hug her, and Song Tianyin carefully placed the little demon king on the ground.
1:3:32|1:3:44|[Huo Xiaolan] remained silent as [Song Tianyin] took a deep breath and said, "[Song Tianyin] rushed towards the cage, the little demon king chased after him, shaking his body in front of him, seeking praise."
1:3:50|1:4:1|[Song Tianyin] demonstrated to the little demon king by squeezing his whole body into the cage, but unexpectedly got locked inside by the little demon king. [Huo Xiaolan] almost burst out laughing.
1:4:1|1:4:19|[Song Tianyin] squatted by the cage again and said, "I didn't expect [Huo Xiaolan] to kick it into the cage with one foot, quickly close the door, and sit in the cage with the little demon king looking aggrieved."
1:4:25|1:4:36|[Huo Xiaolan] took a few steps and then stopped, [Song Tianyin] glanced at the cage and said, "Turn around, the little demon in the cage is full of energy."
1:4:37|1:4:46|[Huo Xiaolan] chuckled lightly and quickly suppressed her smile.
1:5:19|1:5:36|The pawnshop mistress pasted a talisman on the cage. She handed the heavy silver to [Huo Xiaolan], who glanced at [Song Tianyin]. He took the silver, and [Song Tianyin] looked back at the cage.
1:5:39|1:5:46|The little demon king rushed forward, only to be shocked by the cage and smoke. [Song Tianyin] was about to step forward but was stopped by the Pawnshop Mistress.
1:5:52|1:5:58|[Huo Xiaolan] turned decisively and walked away, while [Song Tianyin] also picked up his luggage to leave.
1:5:59|1:6:10|The little demon king hurriedly tried to catch the cage, but was shocked and powerless. [Song Tianyin] walked to the door and then turned back.
1:6:10|1:6:20|The little demon king seemed to see hope, [Song Tianyin] frowned and left, the little demon king burst into laughter, wailing and crying.
1:6:30|1:6:36|In the restaurant, a sumptuous meal was laid out in front of [Song Tianyin] and [Huo Xiaolan].
1:6:38|1:6:51|[Song Tianyin] looked at the child eating with his parents at the next table and suddenly said, "[Huo Xiaolan]" lowered her head and remained silent, and neither of them touched their chopsticks.
1:6:53|1:6:59|The bright moonlight shines through the window of the pawnshop, illuminating the room as Huo Xiaolan sits alone in a cage.
1:6:59|1:7:9|Looking up at the window outside, [Huo Xiaolan] slowly embraced herself again, staying quietly in the cage alone.
1:7:9|1:7:18|The dark night couldn't hide the sadness on [Huo Xiaolan]'s face. The next day,
1:7:18|1:7:25|The sky was getting bright, and the [Pawnshop Mistress] approached the cage of Huoba and revealed two cards.
1:7:26|1:7:35|Huo Ba hesitantly tapped the mahjong tiles with his tentacles, awkwardly smiling, while Pawnshop Mistress looked on in disbelief, pursing her lips.
1:7:35|1:7:45|The market was crowded with people, and monkey vendors were shouting as monkeys, squirrels, and small dogs were locked in cages.
1:7:45|1:7:54|[Song Tianyin] and [Huo Xiaolan] walked through the market, where stalls were densely packed with slaughtered animals.
1:7:54|1:8:12|[Huo Xiaolan] suddenly noticed a piece of torn cloth hanging on the back basket. He pulled out the cloth and unfolded it. The camera then shifted to the past when Huba was gnawing on this torn cloth in the corner, revealing a hollow pattern of a family of three.
1:8:12|1:8:21|[Huo Xiaolan] and [Song Tianyin] looked at each other with embarrassment as a vendor sliced white radishes on the cutting board, each cut making them tremble with emotion.
1:8:43|1:8:52|[Huo Xiaolan] and the Pawnshop Mistress wait anxiously.
1:9:12|1:9:20|The majestic Mountaineering Tower is guarded by two small attendants at the front. As the camera moves up, the building is a complex pattern of yellow and green.
1:9:26|1:9:36|In the building, the five big characters of "Exterminate Demons First" are prominently displayed, and the chefs are busy. The corner is filled with cages, and two children are watching from inside the cages.
1:9:53|1:10:0|Huo Xiaolan also puffed up her cheeks like her. A chef opened the cages of two children.
1:10:9|1:10:22|Chef Tian Shi from Dengxian Building walked over confidently, combing his hair in front of the mirror.
1:10:52|1:10:58|Chef Tian Shi took the double knives and spun them in the air before stopping.
1:12:9|1:12:20|The scalding hot oil pan made Huoba feel scared, and the chef let it slip into the oil pan.
1:12:23|1:12:31|On the street, [Zhu Gao] and [Pang Ying] exchange glances with each other, strutting confidently towards the De Xian Tower.
1:12:38|1:12:41|Two people happily enter the building.
1:12:43|1:12:50|In the kitchen, [Chef Tian Shi] and the chefs looked at the oil pot in confusion as Hu Ba slowly floated up from the center of the oil pot.
1:12:50|1:12:57|He suddenly spat out a mouthful of oil and laughed as he splashed around in the oil pan.
1:12:57|1:13:3|Huo Xiaolan happily swims in the oil pot, and several chefs are scalded by splashing oil droplets.
1:13:22|1:13:29|[Luo Gang] carried a dog over to Pang Ying.
1:13:50|1:13:59|[Huo Xiaolan] and [Song Tianyin] peeked out from behind the wall, carefully observing. [Huo Xiaolan] signaled for [Song Tianyin] to move out, and the two of them cautiously approached a wall.
1:14:0|1:14:4|On the wall, there is a demon face with numbers inscribed on a hand-held ring.
1:14:5|1:14:13|[Song Tianyin] tentatively knocked on the door knocker, then suddenly inserted her two fingers into the closed demon eye.
1:14:26|1:14:31|Slowly rotating, it points to three numbers in turn: 438.
1:14:33|1:14:41|[Song Tianyin] and the other person entered cautiously, and the wall slowly closed behind them.
1:14:42|1:14:51|The master chef, with his burn properly bandaged, looked proudly at the smoking pot in front of him.
1:14:52|1:14:55|Master suddenly felt something was wrong, and the jar exploded instantly.
1:14:58|1:15:2|Inflated Huba flew around the room like a deflating balloon.
1:15:2|1:15:8|The chefs were covered in shards of jars, and the head chef was lying on the ground shaking his legs.
1:16:7|1:16:12|The master washed his hands and picked up two knives.
1:16:14|1:16:32|Huo Ba saw the sharp knife and immediately curled up into a ball. [Pawnshop Mistress] confidently closed her eyes and chopped away at the cutting board with Huo Ba on it. Huo Ba was chopped into a scallion pancake.
1:16:33|1:16:43|Huo Ba is put into a steamer, [Pang Ying] hurries over to meet with [Zhu Gao] cautiously, the two look around carefully and leave.
1:16:43|1:16:56|Unexpectedly, [Luo Gang] was holding a dog and following closely behind them, while the unrecognizable [Pawnshop Mistress] and others were guarding the steaming pot.
1:16:58|1:17:8|The Pawnshop Mistress stepped forward to take a look, only to see Hu Ba sticking out his tongue and jumping around.
1:17:16|1:17:22|Huo Ba sprayed out a puff of steam, leaving [Pawnshop Mistress] covered in flour on her face.
1:17:28|1:17:33|The two young demons with childlike appearances are still being pickled.
1:17:33|1:17:41|They found 4 sneaking away with the pickling pot.
1:17:51|1:17:58|The two chefs looked at each other, Hu Ba was stuck on the special food cart for raw demon brains.
1:17:58|1:18:4|[Song Tianyin] and [Huo Xiaolan] carefully sneaked into the kitchen.
1:18:4|1:18:9|The room was dim and eerie, with slaughtered demons hanging everywhere.
1:18:14|1:18:21|[Song Tianyin] suddenly saw a demon hanging on the ceiling, and he walked forward with sadness in his eyes.
1:18:25|1:18:27|[Song Tianyin] immediately rushed into the kitchen,
1:18:29|1:18:38|[Song Tianyin] saw Xiao Wu was still alive, immediately grabbed a big shovel to drive away the henchmen, and joyfully unlocked Xiao Wu's chains.
1:18:46|1:19:0|A flying noodle bowl aimed at Song Tianyin, who dodged it by crouching down. Chef Tian Shi appeared, swinging the noodle bowl at Song Tianyin, who struggled to defend against Chef Tian Shi's attacks.
1:19:3|1:19:7|Chef Tian Shi dodged the copper incense burner thrown by Song Tianyin.
1:19:7|1:19:12|At this moment, Xiao Wu grabbed Chef Tian Shi's leg, and Aunt Li knocked him down with a fierce push.
1:19:23|1:19:29|[Song Tianyin] tried to turn around to argue, but accidentally stepped on a wooden stick on the ground, causing him to lose balance and lunge towards [Huo Xiaolan].
1:19:29|1:19:33|Their lips met, their eyes locked.
1:19:33|1:19:40|[Huo Xiaolan] quickly withdrew the hand resting on [Song Tianyin]'s shoulder, and the two innocently blinked their eyes as they slowly moved apart.
1:19:40|1:19:49|[Huo Xiaolan] seemed to not have realized yet when [Song Tianyin] sweetly smiled and turned away.
1:19:49|1:19:55|In the kitchen, [Aunt Li] and [Song Tianyin] are no match for [Chef Tian Shi]. [Huo Xiaolan] rushes over and grabs the hammer with a whip.
1:20:6|1:20:13|[Huo Xiaolan] was kicked down by [Chef Tian Shi], and [Song Tianyin] took the opportunity to knock out [Chef Tian Shi].
1:20:13|1:20:22|One kick sent him crashing into the fruit and vegetable stand. [Song Tianyin] crawled towards [Huo Xiaolan] on all fours, while Xiao Wu helped Aunt Li to leave slowly.
1:21:7|1:21:12|The firewood in the stove gradually rose into the air, transforming into a large fireball with sparks flying.
1:21:16|1:21:26|Chef Tian Shi manipulated fireballs to chase Song Tianyin and Huo Xiaolan. The fireballs, like a giant beast's gaping maw, roared and knocked over the braziers at the door.
1:21:27|1:21:36|[Song Tianyin] and [Huo Xiaolan] split up after running into the prison cell. [Song Tianyin] decisively chased after [Huo Xiaolan] and cornered him against the wall, but he managed to dodge and escape in a panic.
1:21:40|1:21:47|[Huo Xiaolan] discovered the fire talisman on [Song Tianyin]'s back and immediately removed it, throwing it onto Chef Tian Shi who happened to arrive just in time.
1:21:54|1:22:2|Chef Tian Shi was knocked down by a fireball, Huo Xiaolan took the opportunity to grab the key from him, and opened the cell door of the Pawnshop Mistress in the prison.
1:22:4|1:22:12|[Song Tianyin] solemnly handed the key to [Pawnshop Mistress], who watched them leave.
1:22:14|1:22:22|The cart with Hu Ba locked inside was sent into the chute, and the chef helped to push the gate.
1:22:22|1:22:25|Huo Xiaolan rose slowly with the elevator.
1:22:27|1:22:40|[Zhu Gao] and [Pang Ying] cautiously walk in the corridor, they open the door of the elevator. The cargo box is slowly rising in the aisle, and the two smile at each other.
1:22:41|1:22:49|At this moment, [Song Tianyin] and [Huo Xiaolan] were sneaking into the kitchen. [Pang Ying] and the two of them transformed back into their demon forms, slowly climbing up to the attic.
1:22:52|1:23:1|Two demons saw Hu Ba, their faces lit up with joy, and they grabbed the bottom of the ladder compartment.
1:23:1|1:23:10|[Luo Gang] discovered the human skin left behind by [Pang Ying], put down the little dog in his arms, and stood on the escalator looking down.
1:23:15|1:23:24|He leaped down, landing heavily in the stairwell, and Zhu Gao peeked out and saw Luo Gang.
1:23:25|1:23:40|[Luo Gang] pulled the rope to the two monsters, [Luo Gang] swung his knife towards [Zhu Gao], and the ladder compartment moved accordingly.
1:23:42|1:23:48|[Zhu Gao] climbed with [Pang Ying] on his back, only to find [Luo Gang] right above them.
1:23:48|1:23:55|[Roger] is being attacked in turns, using his legs to hold onto the wall and prevent himself from falling down.
1:23:55|1:23:59|And at this moment, the elevator arrived, and Hu Ba was pulled out by a maid.
1:24:2|1:24:10|[Luo Gang] was no match for [Zhu Gao] and [Pang Ying], as the two demons coordinated perfectly, pushing him back step by step. [Pang Ying] sat on [Luo Gang]'s shoulders, pounding him.
1:24:10|1:24:28|Jumping to a high place, giving him a fierce push, they were fighting and suddenly all three fell in the straight ladder passage. Two of them saw the box ladder falling and jumped out of the passage, but unexpectedly [Luo Gang] was still in the passage.
1:24:34|1:24:53|At the critical moment, the two demons dragged out [Luo Gang], who was rescued and showed a smile. Meanwhile, not far away, Chef Tian Shi woke up and used a big hammer to strike [Zhu Gao].
1:24:54|1:24:58|[Luo Gang] took the axe from [Zhu Gao] and assumed a fighting stance.
1:25:1|1:25:11|Luo Gang fights with Chef Tian Shi, while the two demons take turns joining the battle nearby, showing excellent coordination.
1:25:11|1:25:20|They were fighting on one side, while on the other side, a maid pushed a food cart slowly bringing in [Huo Ba].
1:25:54|1:26:4|On the other side, Song Tianyin and Luo Gang arrived at the kitchen and found some movement in the vegetable basket.
1:26:4|1:26:10|Two people helped [Grandma] out of the basket.
1:27:22|1:27:27|A bug crawled on top of [Huo Xiaolan]'s head, followed by a group of window flower fairies flying into the shop.
1:27:27|1:27:33|After they stood in front of [Huo Ba], they threw the live beetle into the air and beat it up.
1:27:34|1:27:42|But unexpectedly, Chef Tian Shi waved his fan and sent them flying. Huo Xiaolan and Luo Gang rushed into the hall, she used a hook to pull back Hu Ba.
1:27:43|1:27:48|The attack from behind was blocked.
1:27:49|1:28:3|[Huo Xiaolan] rushed to the dining table and fought with [Chef Tian Shi] in three steps, [Song Tianyin] patted [Huba]'s face, who was already drunk and incoherent.
1:28:3|1:28:13|[Song Tianyin] first unfastened the buckle of the food cart and picked up [Huo Xiaolan], while [Huo Xiaolan] was kicked and sent flying to the ground.
1:28:23|1:28:43|[Huo Xiaolan] threw a smoke bomb, causing everyone to lose their direction in the smoke. Suddenly, [Chef Tian Shi] was pulled back and stumbled, but he quickly retaliated. [Huo Xiaolan] was unable to move in the swirling wind, but [Ge Qianhu] laughed and said:
1:29:39|1:29:52|[Grandma] recited a spell with her mouth and made a move with her hand, causing the utensils on the table to float in mid-air. After a few seconds, all the utensils fell down, and [Chef Tian Shi] waved at her.
1:30:41|1:30:47|[Song Tianyin] slowly walked out, covering [Huo Ba]'s mouth.
1:30:56|1:30:59|[Song Tianyin] looked at [Grandma] and [Huo Xiaolan], both of them gazing at [Song Tianyin] with difficulty.
1:31:1|1:31:18|[Song Tianyin] suddenly smiled and said, uncovering [Huo Xiaolan]'s mouth, which was shooting fruits like a machine gun. [Grandma] and [Huo Xiaolan] landed safely, while [Chef Tian Shi] and the guests scattered to avoid the fruit barrage.
1:31:19|1:31:25|[Huo Xiaolan] spits out fruit while making a face and high-speedly rushes forward, propelling [Song Tianyin] to soar parallel to the ground.
1:31:25|1:31:34|Song Tianyin attacks while holding onto Huba and sliding on the back of a chair. Grandma and Huo Xiaolan both cover their heads and crouch down, as Chef Tian Shi leaps onto the second floor.
1:31:35|1:31:44|Just as he reached the second floor, he was hit in the face by a durian and fell to the ground. [Song Tianyin] instructed Hu Ba to continue eating fruit as ammunition, and shortly after, he came out again to fire.
1:31:44|1:31:51|Ge Qianhu's hat was knocked off by a fruit, and he spun into the air and landed on the table.
1:31:51|1:32:1|Huo Ba stuck out his tongue, exhausted, taunted by [Ge Qianhu]. A cut suddenly appeared on his left cheek.
1:32:1|1:32:8|[Ge Qianhu] touched his face in disbelief, about to erupt, a blood mark appearing on his right cheek.
1:32:11|1:32:21|[Song Tianyin] looked at him puzzled, and everyone stood up to watch. At that moment, [Ge Qianhu]'s face twitched and began to change wildly.
1:32:21|1:32:29|One by one, the faces slapped on his face popped out, and after he put out five faces in a row, he weakly fell down.
1:32:34|1:32:38|[Ge Qianhu] turned into a gray-skinned creature covered in mushrooms.
1:32:38|1:32:44|He shrank timidly and then suddenly expanded.
1:32:51|1:32:58|Song Tianyin shattered the stone pillar.
1:33:0|1:33:9|He overturned the banquet, causing [Song Tianyin] and others to fall heavily to the ground. [Chef Tian Shi], holding a musical instrument, gathered together and launched a sonic attack against [Ge Qianhu].
1:33:10|1:33:20|He roared and smashed the long table, throwing all the [Chef Tian Shi] out.
1:33:22|1:33:29|[Grandma] rushed up and fiercely stomped on [Ge Qianhu]'s foot, then stood with hands on hips glaring at him. [Ge Qianhu] slapped her, sending her flying.
1:33:29|1:33:32|[Grandma] broke through the fence.
1:33:32|1:33:39|Flying, who usually follows [Ge Qianhu] around, was immediately scared away by his madness.
1:33:40|1:33:47|[Huo Xiaolan] used a whip to tie [Ge Qianhu]'s neck to a stone in an attempt to control him.
1:33:51|1:33:54|The stone pillar was unexpectedly shattered by [Ge Qianhu]'s brute force.
1:33:54|1:34:0|Song Tianyin hit him with the pipa, but ended up breaking the pipa in half.
1:34:0|1:34:9|Threw a banana that landed in [Ge Qianhu]'s nostril, causing [Ge Qianhu] to sneeze out the banana, which unexpectedly knocked [Song Tianyin] flying.
1:34:10|1:34:19|[Ge Qianhu] grabbed four [Chef Tian Shi], exerted force to slam them against the wall, while [Grandma] approached [Song Tianyin] with a sword.
1:34:28|1:34:32|Tianyin looked at the bustling Ge Qianhu.
1:34:33|1:34:38|He jumped onto the roof beam, spun around, and kicked Chef Tian Shi flying.
1:34:38|1:34:45|Tianyin, holding a rusty sword, was about to strike at [Ge Qianhu], but Ge Qianhu held the sword with both hands, rendering him unable to move.
1:34:45|1:34:54|He immediately punched him against the pillar, causing Tianyin to groan in pain. Huo Xiaolan rubbed his face in confusion, while Ge Qianhu began laughing hysterically.
1:34:56|1:35:2|The sword struck Song Tianyin's chest directly.
1:35:48|1:36:5|[Huo Xiaolan] could no longer contain her hatred. [Huo Ba] cautiously approached Tianyin and, seeing the sword stuck in his body, trembled as she climbed onto him.
1:36:5|1:36:11|[Huo Xiaolan] cautiously walked over and stood firmly on Song Tianyin.
1:36:11|1:36:20|Using its tender limbs, the rusted sword is pulled out, leaving a wound on the tentacle.
1:36:21|1:36:27|The sword was finally pulled out, and [Huo Xiaolan]'s blood was spilled all over the ground.
1:36:27|1:36:33|Tianyin's meridians suddenly surged, revealing a faint golden glow.
1:36:33|1:36:37|The sword on the ground absorbed the blood of [Huo Xiaolan], and all the rust disappeared.
1:36:37|1:36:47|In an instant, the light shone anew, and the bloodstains on the ground sprouted tender grass sparsely. [Song Tianyin] suddenly jerked awake.
1:36:47|1:36:56|Mrs. Zheng protected Zheng Tao underneath her, holding up a wooden board to warn Ge Qianhu. In the chaos, she unexpectedly released a hidden weapon that shot into Ge Qianhu's eye.
1:36:57|1:37:4|[Huo Xiaolan] leaped into the air and stabbed towards [Ge Qianhu]'s eyes with a dagger, but he threw her heavily to the ground.
1:37:8|1:37:14|At a critical moment, [Song Tianyin] slashed with a sword and pierced its claw, while [Ge Qianhu] jumped and grabbed its foot.
1:37:17|1:37:21|[Song Tianyin] immediately displayed his moves, completing the entire Song Family's Ten Strokes.
1:37:22|1:37:34|The sword immediately glowed red, as if it had just been forged, and [Song Tianyin] rushed towards [Ge Qianhu] with the sword.
1:37:34|1:37:41|The sword pierced straight into the belly of [Ge Qianhu] amidst the blazing flames.
1:37:42|1:37:49|[Song Tianyin] kicked up his feet, kicking [Ge Qianhu] in the belly and drew out his sword.
1:37:50|1:37:59|Ge Qianhu's belly was burned bright red, he howled and crashed into the pillar, falling heavily to the ground. Huo Xiaolan helped Song Tianyin up.
1:38:0|1:38:7|With that, [Ge Qianhu] took his last breath.
1:38:7|1:38:16|In the prison cell, [Luo Gang] and the others worked together to trap Chef Tian Shi in a cage. Exhausted, [Luo Gang] sat on the ground, while [Pang Ying] and [Zhu Gao] approached.
1:38:17|1:38:28|The two demons exchanged a glance and kissed Luo Gang's cheek together.
1:38:32|1:38:38|[Luo Gang] smiled foolishly as he watched the two demons disappear from sight.
1:38:39|1:38:47|And at this moment, the store was in a mess, with [Song Tianyin] and [Huo Xiaolan] helping up [Grandma].
1:38:50|1:38:58|[Huo Xiaolan] pointed silently at [Song Tianyin], leaving [Grandma] feeling awkward.
1:39:28|1:39:35|The little demon was startled and quickly flew away. [Grandma] pulled back the intricate patterned curtains and leaped down.
1:39:39|1:39:42|[Huo Xiaolan] and [Song Tianyin] looked at each other and smiled as they watched [Grandma] walk away.
1:39:43|1:39:50|In the Lantern Tower, the lanterns are askew, and the hall filled with guests is littered with bodies. [Pang Ying] and [Zhu Gao] see the mess in the dining car.
1:39:56|1:40:3|[Pang Ying] and [Zhu Gao] embraced each other, crying in pain.
1:40:5|1:40:15|The villagers of Yongning Village in the valley stood at the intersection, looking at Song Tianyin and Huo Xiaolan.
1:40:21|1:40:28|Xiao Wu and two older ladies stood at the front of the line, [Huo Ba] blinked and turned to [Song Tianyin].
1:40:54|1:41:11|[Huo Xiaolan] disappeared in an instant, and [Huo Xiaolan] popped out from behind [Song Tianyin], happily spinning in circles. [Song Tianyin] smiled and then patted its shoulder.
1:41:22|1:41:30|[Huo Ba] heard his name and extended his tentacles, shaking his body. [Song Tianyin] stood up slowly and said:
1:41:41|1:41:59|[Huo Ba], who reached out his tentacles wanting a hug, was immediately frightened by [Song Tianyin]. [Song Tianyin] drew a circle of flames with his sword, forcing [Huo Ba] to leave him.
1:42:7|1:42:14|Memories resurface, the way his father drove him away years ago, mirroring the current situation with [Song Tianyin].
1:42:16|1:42:29|[Huo Ba] stretched out its tentacles to wipe away the tears, then turned around and silently walked away. At the corner leading into the mountains, it quietly glanced back at [Song Tianyin], wiped away its tears, and left.
1:42:29|1:42:33|[Huo Xiaolan] walked up to [Song Tianyin] and looked at [Huba], saying:
1:43:3|1:43:9|[Huo Xiaolan] struggled with the luggage on her back, swinging her arms and sighing:
1:43:25|1:43:34|[Huo Xiaolan] grabbed [Song Tianyin]'s arm as if to bite him, then playfully let go.
1:43:43|1:43:50|Huo Xiaolan and Aunt Li are walking together on the grass, with Aunt Li saying in the distance:
1:45:16|1:45:26|A group of little trumpet monsters dance neatly in the valley.
