0:0:39|0:0:46|The door was opened by a young man wearing a beret. After a brief eye contact, the man with glasses entered the newspaper office carrying a basket.
0:0:46|0:0:55|Inside the newspaper office, numerous staff members are busy at their respective positions, with newspapers being printed and reporting on the current anti-Japanese war situation.
0:2:8|0:2:13|On the yellow soil along the coast, [Lin Xiang] is still explaining radio knowledge to the soldiers.
0:2:13|0:2:19|On the other side, sitting on the rooftop terrace, [Lan Fang] was drawing a children's collaborative painting.
0:2:19|0:2:24|Suddenly, he seemed to know something and stood up, walking towards the edge of the rooftop.
0:2:24|0:2:29|[Qin Fengwu] closed the sketchbook, leaned against the railing at the edge, and looked down at the alley below.
0:2:35|0:2:40|In the narrow alley, several military trucks suddenly appeared.
0:2:40|0:2:48|Japanese soldiers on the truck, each holding a rifle, suddenly dispersed and surrounded the gate of the Fanzhong Daily News without warning.
0:3:20|0:3:27|Outside the house, Japanese soldiers have started throwing grenades to surround it, and the officer insists on not negotiating.
0:3:27|0:3:35|At this moment, the leader of the Japanese army walked into the dilapidated Shanghai Minsheng Daily office, illuminating the stairs to the second floor, pointing upwards, and shouting loudly:
0:3:38|0:3:50|A young man with a gun in his hand rushed from the corner of the second floor and aimed at the Japanese junior officer downstairs in the secret radio room, using a large cabinet to block the door.
0:3:50|0:4:7|The two men holding important radio parts have quietly arrived on the rooftop of the newspaper office, ready to split up. The young man who had just fought with the Japanese army inside the newspaper office was now lying at the stairway with a face full of blood. He watched as a large number of Japanese soldiers headed towards the second floor, and in his dying moments, he detonated a hand grenade.
0:4:12|0:4:30|The huge impact sent the Japanese soldiers flying out. The newspaper office had become a mess. At this moment, the man in the beret tightly held a small package and ran to the street. The Japanese military trucks drove into the alleys of the island, and the street vendors' stalls were also brought into the mainland for bullying, whether it was the ordinary people strolling on the street or the small vendors.
0:4:30|0:4:45|Everyone was scared and quickly hid in all directions. The man in the beret slung the package diagonally across his body and then ran frantically towards the safe zone. A big truck chased closely behind him in the narrow alley, knocking down all the thatched huts on both sides.
0:4:45|0:5:0|On the other side, the man with glasses who escaped from the newspaper office with the beret man arrived at a relatively safe street. He quickly ran into the World Savings Bank on the side of the street, adjusted his cramped state, put his hands in his pockets, and calmly walked into the house.
0:5:0|0:5:5|Approaching is a woman dressed in Japanese military uniform, [Masako Akiyama].
0:5:5|0:5:7|She walked with her head held high and a blank expression.
0:5:7|0:5:13|Who knew, as she passed by the man in glasses, suddenly a high kick came towards him.
0:5:13|0:5:17|The man in glasses was caught off guard by the situation, but quickly launched a counterattack.
0:5:17|0:5:32|Immediately, the two of them started fighting bare-handed. The scene then shifts to Lin Xiang's side, as he quickly runs towards the bridge with swift steps, closely followed by a large group of Japanese soldiers carrying long rifles. Lin Xiang runs towards the center of the bridge.
0:5:32|0:5:41|Unexpectedly, a group of Japanese soldiers also ran towards them. Surrounded by the two enemy forces, the brave man named [Liang Dong] didn't hesitate to run towards the edge of the bridge, leaped into the air, and landed on the bridge.
0:5:41|0:5:56|He fell into the water and swam towards the deep part of the river. The Japanese soldiers on the bridge started shooting at him, but the polite man in the river was shot with a gun standing upright. The river was filled with blood, and the important documents wrapped in the package slowly sank to the bottom of the river with his death.
0:5:56|0:6:12|Inside the Bank of Nations, the fight between the man with glasses and the Japanese female officer [Masako Akiyama] is coming to an end. The two are fighting on the second floor of the bank. [Masako Akiyama] lands several high side kicks on the man with glasses, leaving him dizzy. Then, she delivers a flying kick, sending him crashing into the central chandelier in the room.
0:6:12|0:6:17|And the important radio components wrapped inside it also fell to the ground in the bank hall.
0:6:17|0:6:25|In the newspaper office, [Guan Shuzhang] pressed his body against the iron door of the radio station. Unexpectedly, a hand grenade blew him out, and he struggled to get up from the ground.
0:6:31|0:6:36|[Qin Fengwu], dressed in a straight suit, holding an umbrella with a skull handle, walked in from the door.
0:6:36|0:6:48|She first used an umbrella to poke at the radio that had been blown to pieces, then placed the umbrella on the table, picked up a sharp knife and stabbed towards Director Guan, and then threw Director Guan out of the second-floor window.
0:6:48|0:6:53|Thus, the underground Communist Party radio station in Shanghai was completely destroyed by the Japanese army.
0:7:6|0:7:14|Japanese soldiers not only destroyed our underground secret radio station, but also cruelly killed many of our comrades who were defending the station.
0:7:14|0:7:26|[Lin Xiang], after receiving the order from his superiors to rebuild the radio station, stood alone on the desolate loess plateau. He looked down upon the numerous hills in front of him, his gaze determined and courageous, as if no challenge could daunt him.
0:7:27|0:7:35|But in all the hills, it seems so small, a radio intelligence battle is about to begin.
0:7:35|0:7:50|"The remake of 'Counterattack' is based on the classic film 'Eternal Waves'. Behind the release of this film, the scriptwriting alone took three years, during which it went through four changes of screenwriters and six revisions of the art design. The screenwriters also delved into a large amount of historical records and made certain innovations."
0:7:50|0:8:4|The film is a spy action movie produced by Nanhai Film "Fenggu Culture", directed by Zhong Shaoxiong, starring [Aaron Kwok], [Zhao Liying], [Zhang Han], [Zhang Lanxin], [Zhu Yilong], [Yu Xiaoguang], [Li Bin], [Cao Cao].
0:8:4|0:8:14|The film tells the story of Lin Xiang, an underground worker who was sent to the perilous Shanghai after the Songhu Battle to rebuild the underground resistance against the Japanese invaders.
0:8:14|0:8:30|Here, he meets the simple yet righteous [Lan Fang], and the two temporarily pose as a fake couple. This underground party couple, one representing justice and the other evil, join hands to confront the dangers of war, facing off against Japanese invaders and spies from the puppet government in a thrilling life-and-death struggle.
0:8:30|0:8:42|In the streets of Shanghai, Japanese flags are hanging everywhere, and Japanese troops are marching with flags held high. Military trucks are driving behind them, and even the civilians are standing on the side of the street holding Japanese flags.
0:8:42|0:8:45|At this moment, the superior is giving orders to [Masako Akiyama].
0:9:14|0:9:17|This is a completely different world from Yan'an, filled with a sense of gloom in the air.
0:9:46|0:9:48|Radio political commissar [Lin Xiang] also arrived in Shanghai at this time.
0:9:48|0:9:55|He stood on the street, blending into the crowd, watching the large Japanese army entering Shanghai, feeling very uneasy.
0:9:55|0:10:3|He then arrived at his residence, placed his luggage on the table, roughly inspected the room, opened the window, and looked out at the scenery outside.
0:10:14|0:10:20|After Masako Akiyama left, Qin Fengwu snorted fiercely. In the textile factory on the other side of the Hua Realm, a young man exclaimed excitedly,
0:11:12|0:11:19|Watching as her colleagues all talked about the tasks they had received, only the textile factory worker [Lan Fang] did not receive any task.
0:11:19|0:11:25|She sat in her seat looking a bit lonely, not even interested in the sunflower seeds she usually enjoys.
0:11:25|0:11:31|[Lan Fang] looked around at her colleagues, then lowered her head expressionlessly, her thoughts unknown.
0:11:32|0:11:40|Early the next morning, the underground Communist Party intelligence officer [Big Cat] had a pipe in his mouth and a camera in his hand, taking photos of [Lin Xiang]'s residence.
0:11:40|0:11:50|[Lin Xiang] walked out of the house and looked up at his residence on the second floor. He saw that [Big Cat] had already stopped fooling around and was putting up wooden boards on the roof of [Lin Xiang]'s place.
0:11:50|0:11:54|After a busy period, he walked up to the second-floor corridor and reached up to change the light bulb above his head.
0:11:55|0:12:2|The flowers and plants at the door were placed on the wooden board he had just installed, while [Lin Xiang] stood downstairs watching it all.
0:12:2|0:12:9|After Big Cat finished packing up and left, he walked to the corridor on the second floor, first looking up at the light bulbs that had already been replaced.
0:12:9|0:12:15|Ryukyu reached out and unscrewed the light bulb, then took out the piece of paper between the light bulb and the lampshade.
0:12:16|0:12:26|Shortly after, [Lin Xiang] squatted down and took out a light bulb from the toolbox next to his feet, replaced it, then stood up and pulled the nearby rope, and the light bulb immediately lit up.
0:12:26|0:12:38|After all this was done, he came to the stage downstairs to have tea, while [Big Cat] stood below the stage, with a cigarette in his mouth, facing away from [Lin Xiang], picked up the camera and took a selfie of the two.
0:12:38|0:12:54|The sky was very gray. An old man with a hunchback was pulling a small cart and walking in a narrow alley. He slowly made his way to the defeated Shanghai Longsheng Newspaper Office, looked up at the sign, and then unsteadily walked in.
0:12:54|0:13:0|The room was already in ruins, with the blown-up tables, chairs, and benches all charred black, unrecognizable from their previous appearance.
0:13:0|0:13:17|On the day of the incident, with the Japanese troops reinforcing Shanghai and the newspaper reporting the defeat of the Nationalist Army burnt beyond recognition, the old man looked up at the building, then pushed the cart to the room where the secret radio station was previously stored. He walked to a table, picked up a round piece with a hollow center with his hand.
0:13:17|0:13:26|Carefully examining it, he then blew on it with his mouth, before picking up the long-handled button for the transmitter and putting it into the pocket at his waist.
0:13:26|0:13:29|Finally, the old man walked into the innermost room.
0:13:32|0:13:36|The old man glanced at him, paid no attention, and continued walking inside.
0:13:41|0:13:48|He stood up as if unwilling to give up, poking the old man with the umbrella, causing the old man to fearfully retreat.
0:13:52|0:13:55|The old man took the biscuit and started eating it voraciously.
0:13:55|0:13:58|Qin Fengwu's body gradually leaned towards the old man.
0:13:58|0:14:4|To everyone's surprise, the crumbs sprayed out by the old man eating too quickly landed straight on Qin Fengwu's head.
0:14:4|0:14:33|Qin Fengwu was so angry that he knocked down the old man with an umbrella. At this moment, Masako Akiyama arrived in the room with a few henchmen. The old man got up from the ground, looking at Qin Fengwu with a gaze that was both angry and sharp. Qin Fengwu, standing in front of the mirror, suddenly walked towards the old man, feeling around his body until he touched a hard object around his waist. Qin Fengwu smirked. Seeing this, the old man picked up a sharp object nearby and pressed it against Qin Fengwu's neck. Cen Zimo quickly aimed a gun at the old man. Qin Fengwu raised the umbrella in front of him and shouted loudly.
0:14:35|0:14:43|Masako Akiyama did not care about her companion Qin Fengwu. The old man took advantage of the chaos to push Qin Fengwu forward, and then he ran out of the window.
0:14:47|0:15:18|Masako Akiyama pushed Qin Fengwu away in a hurry and chased after the old man escaping. The old man jumped from the window and lay straight on the barrier-free passage by the stairs, sliding down following gravity. Masako Akiyama jumped right next to the stair railing, and as she saw the old man sliding through several turns, without hesitation, she jumped directly to a lower railing. After a few rounds, Masako Akiyama finally caught up with the old man, without saying a word, she lifted her foot and kicked towards him. It was clear that the old man was also skilled.
0:15:18|0:15:19|Easily dodged it.
0:15:19|0:15:33|During the fight between the two, a man with sunglasses suddenly appeared on the second-floor corridor. He could see the two fighting, quickly hid by the wall, then looked up at the large barrel on the roof and ran up quickly.
0:15:33|0:15:52|The man in sunglasses used a crowbar to smash the barrel towards the fighting area, but it had no effect twice in a row. He smashed the barrel towards the ground again, successfully separating the two. The old man took advantage of the distraction and ran away, while [Masako Akiyama] angrily looked towards the rooftop. The man in sunglasses quickly turned and left.
0:15:52|0:15:59|The old man escaped and ran wildly on the street, with the [Japanese soldiers] chasing closely behind, shouting for him to stop, and ordering the surrounding crowd to disperse.
0:16:2|0:16:8|The old man fled to a gathering place of beggars and quickly found a safe place to hide.
0:16:8|0:16:16|Japanese soldiers quickly caught up with guns in hand. They destroyed the thatched hut made by beggars in search of someone, and indiscriminately shot and killed innocent beggars.
0:16:16|0:16:20|[Masako Akiyama] watched the scene in front of her on the second floor, not daring to act rashly.
0:16:20|0:16:27|The soldiers downstairs were still burning, killing, and looting wantonly. After searching for a while and not finding anyone, they soon left.
0:16:28|0:16:38|[Mo Jingnan] came downstairs and watched as the beggars cleaned up the tents destroyed by the Japanese army. He looked around and didn't find the person he wanted to see, so he began shouting loudly.
0:16:48|0:16:55|The old man hiding in the shadows pulled off the mask on his face, revealing that he was actually [Lin Xiang] in disguise.
0:17:28|0:17:32|Originally, the identity of the man in sunglasses was the underground member of the Communist Party of China, [Cen Zimo].
0:17:32|0:17:43|The meaning of what he shouted is, I am a probationary party member [Cen Zimo], a subordinate of the official society chief. When the newspaper office had an accident, I was out on a mission, but lost contact with the organization. Now I request to return to the team.
0:17:43|0:17:49|[Lin Xiang] did not immediately believe in these words after hearing them, but instead remained silent in the shadows.
0:17:49|0:17:55|[Lin Xiang] tidied himself up, glanced at [Cen Zimo] on the second floor, then left the place and returned to his own residence.
0:17:55|0:18:6|He sat at the table and made a simple radio by himself, lifting the movable wooden board on the ground, fixing the radio on top of it, and then flipping it back.
0:18:6|0:18:9|On a rainy night, [Lin Xiang] walks down the street holding an umbrella.
0:18:20|0:18:30|When he walked into a narrow alley, the two Japanese people behind him called out to him. [Masako Akiyama] turned around and locked eyes with them, the rain seemed to have gotten heavier than before.
0:18:30|0:18:38|The patrol of the Fa Clan, [Liang Dong], wearing a cloak, rode a bicycle to a secluded place, where a man wearing wooden clogs reported to him.
0:18:49|0:18:56|[Liang Dong] struck a match, lit the cigarette in his mouth, and walked towards the scene of the incident.
0:18:56|0:18:59|The patrol officer in the middle of the road saw him and quickly greeted him.
0:18:59|0:19:6|[Liang Dong] walked slowly towards the body, only to see a Japanese man lying on the ground face up, with the handle of an umbrella inserted in his chest.
0:19:6|0:19:14|In a flash, the Japanese man charged at [Lin Xiang] with a sword, and [Lin Xiang] blocked it with an umbrella, which was then sliced in half.
0:19:21|0:19:26|Another Japanese man was stabbed in the abdomen by [Lin Xiang] before his death.
0:20:10|0:20:16|Colonel Yamazaki suddenly slammed the table and stared at [Liang Dong], asking what was going on.
0:20:16|0:20:24|Liang Dong immediately knelt down in fear to answer.
0:20:24|0:20:29|[Colonel Yamazaki], after hearing these words, slammed the table in anger.
0:20:44|0:20:56|Colonel Yamazaki slapped him in the face in anger, and the dancer beside him brought out a bottle of wine, telling Liang Dong, "If you finish it, I'll give you another three days," then smiled.
0:20:56|0:20:59|[Liang Dong] looked up at [Colonel Yamazaki] and also smiled.
0:20:59|0:21:5|Without saying a word, he picked up the bottle and poured it into his mouth, drinking until the bottle was empty, his face covered in wine stains.
0:21:5|0:21:12|Colonel Yamazaki picked up a stack of banknotes from the table, smiling as he placed the banknotes horizontally on Liang Dong's head.
0:21:13|0:21:16|At this moment, [Liang Dong] showed no signs of anger, but instead grinned and laughed out loud.
0:21:19|0:21:25|After beating [Colonel Yamazaki], he stuffed the money into [Liang Dong]'s chest and then shouted at him to get lost.
0:21:27|0:21:34|Kneeling on the ground, [Liang Dong] slightly raised his body and walked towards the door, but before he could take two steps, he collapsed on the ground.
0:21:34|0:21:40|He picked up the banknotes at hand, then stood up and stuffed them into his chest, laughing as he walked towards the door.
0:22:5|0:22:8|Rijun carried [Lan Fang] on his shoulders and brought her into the Yiji Hall.
0:22:16|0:22:23|The Japanese soldiers took [Lan Fang] into a room, threw her violently to the ground, and then closed the door with a smile on their faces.
0:22:23|0:22:28|[Lan Fang] stood up and overturned the table in front of her, attracting the attention of [Liang Dong] in the restroom.
0:22:28|0:22:36|Liang Dong listened to the sound and slowly approached the house. He walked to the outside of the house and, through the crack in the door, saw the Japanese soldiers pressing Lan Fang underneath them.
0:22:36|0:22:42|[Liang Dong] saw this scene, tears filled his eyes, he pushed the door open wide gap, wanting to go forward to save people.
0:22:43|0:22:52|But when Li Zhi pulled him back, he just watched quietly as [Lan Fang] went through her ordeal, and at that moment, [Lan Fang] also saw [Liang Dong] standing indifferently outside the door.
0:22:52|0:23:2|[Liang Dong] saw the look in his eyes, and suddenly flashed back to a scene from his childhood when he locked eyes with a little girl. Just as he was about to open the door to stop them, [Helan Fang]'s companion had already rushed in and loudly intervened.
0:23:9|0:23:17|Immediately, [Lan Fang]'s companions were wrestling with the Japanese soldiers, and [Liang Dong] saw someone coming to help and slammed the door shut heavily.
0:23:17|0:23:30|[Lan Fang] slowly got up from the ground and picked up a bottle to smash at the Japanese soldiers.
0:23:36|0:23:48|Several people ran onto the main street, and the man with a beard at the door quickly picked up a camera. The Japanese soldiers also ran out, and [Lan Fang] and the others pushed the cart next to them, crashing into the Japanese soldiers.
0:23:48|0:23:57|Lan Fang and his companions left this place of controversy, while the man with a beard at the door was still holding a camera and taking pictures in their direction as they left.
0:23:57|0:24:5|At night, [Liang Dong] leisurely rides his bicycle to a stop in front of his house. He brings the things from the bike inside and lays out the items he bought on the table.
0:24:13|0:24:16|He then threw the chicken on the table onto the ground.
0:24:29|0:24:41|[Liang Dong] was kicked out of the house by his mother with a broom. He walked to the alley, feeling restless and unable to find relief, then picked up a gun and shattered an empty glass bottle.
0:24:41|0:24:43|At this moment, the resident on the second floor opened the window and started cursing loudly.
0:24:49|0:24:52|Liang Dong, who was being scolded to his face, felt even worse.
0:24:52|0:24:58|He flicked half of the cigarette in his mouth onto the ground with his hand, then sat on the platform by the artificial pond.
0:24:58|0:25:3|He took out a cigarette case only to find there were no cigarettes inside, then he threw the cigarette case away.
0:25:3|0:25:8|At this moment, [Cen Zimo] sat down beside him and handed him the cigarette box.
0:25:8|0:25:10|[Liang Dong] took a cigarette and spoke.
0:25:19|0:25:31|[Liang Dong] fell silent after hearing [Cen Zimo]'s response. Tears welled up in his eyes as he took a deep drag on his cigarette, exhaling smoke as if trying to calm his troubled mind, before finally speaking.
0:26:0|0:26:10|He watched as [Cen Zimo] spoke again, then both [Liang Dong] turned and left. [Cen Zimo] sat by the pond, quietly watching his figure disappear.
0:26:10|0:26:16|The next day, the streets were bustling with people, with vendors setting up stalls on both sides of the street.
0:26:16|0:26:30|[Lin Xiang] came to a vendor selling various parts. He picked and chose in front of the goods, took out a part and listened to it by his ear. After feeling that it was what he wanted, he handed a few pieces of silver to the boss, turned around with a long pancake umbrella, and left.
0:26:31|0:26:34|Returning to his residence, [Lin Xiang] sat at the table, busy with something.
0:26:34|0:26:42|He tightened the screws of the radio with a screwdriver, then picked up a palm-sized object resembling an oxygen cylinder and installed it on the radio.
0:26:42|0:26:47|Next, he picked up the connecting wire on the table and inserted it into the radio, starting the installation.
0:26:47|0:26:51|By nightfall, [Lin Xiang] finally finished producing the radio program.
0:26:51|0:26:57|He put on his headphones, turned on the desk lamp, plugged in the radio, and then transmitted information to the outside world.
0:27:15|0:27:19|The leader stood up to take the telegram and, looking at its contents, began to speak.
0:27:27|0:27:31|[Liang Dong] wearing sunglasses, holding a file, approached [Masako Akiyama] and gestured for her to take a look.
0:27:31|0:27:33|Masako Akiyama told him,
0:27:36|0:27:40|[Liang Dong] and [Masako Akiyama] arrived at a shop, where the shopkeeper greeted them.
0:27:46|0:27:51|The shopkeeper took out an ID card for them to check, but [Masako Akiyama] said it wasn't hers at all.
0:27:51|0:27:58|[Liang Dong] and [Masako Akiyama] came out of the shop, and he happened to see someone looking at them from the window on the second floor.
0:27:58|0:28:3|Lin Xiang, who was discovered, quickly pulled down the curtains, and Liang Dong immediately prepared to go upstairs to ask him.
0:28:4|0:28:8|[Lin Xiang] agilely escapes from the complex rooftop.
0:28:8|0:28:12|[Liang Dong] threw the documents aside and got up to chase after him.
0:28:12|0:28:19|[Lin Xiang] is shuttling across various rooftops, while [Liang Dong] is watching his escape direction and chasing through various residential houses.
0:28:19|0:28:27|[Lin Xiang] takes a big step from one rooftop to another, with [Liang Dong] closely following suit, causing [Masako Akiyama] to spill her meal.
0:28:27|0:28:30|He didn't stop and quickly caught up.
0:28:30|0:28:49|Lin Xiang performed a front somersault on the roof, then ran forward expressionlessly. Liang Dong walked past the wooden planks connecting the house and the corridor, opened one room door, then walked to another room and opened it. He rushed up the stairs. Lin Xiang jumped down from a distance, and then Liang Dong opened a door beside him.
0:28:49|0:29:7|[Liang Dong] watched as [Lin Xiang] ran ahead, but he caught up with him. The distance between the two was getting shorter and shorter. At that moment, [Liang Dong] jumped onto a wooden board, but it couldn't bear his weight and broke. [Liang Dong] fell down from the board and watched as [Lin Xiang] ran past him. He angrily threw his sunglasses aside.
0:29:8|0:29:14|He stood up, looked in the direction of [Lin Xiang], angrily kicked open the door in front of him and chased after.
0:29:14|0:29:20|[Lin Xiang] swiftly shuttled between rooftops, with [Liang Dong] hot on his heels.
0:29:20|0:29:25|He arrived at a corridor, watching [Lin Xiang] who had just leaped over, but he didn't dare to take the risk of jumping over himself.
0:29:25|0:29:32|He picked up the ladder next to him, placed it in the center between two buildings, and then slid his body along the ladder.
0:29:32|0:29:40|[Lin Xiang] ran very fast, after passing through several houses, he found a hiding room, entered directly through the window, and then turned around to close the window.
0:29:41|0:29:54|[Liang Dong] followed closely and arrived at this place, only to find no sign of [Lin Xiang]. He cautiously took out a gun from his pocket and approached the door of a room, noticing a large lock hanging on it. He then proceeded to another door in the vicinity.
0:29:54|0:30:13|Little did he know, all his actions were being watched by [Lin Xiang] hiding in the shadows, while [Liang Dong] searched with a gun in hand. Suddenly, a noise caught his attention, leading him to the source of the sound. As he prepared to break in, [Lin Xiang] was already inside the house, observing [Liang Dong]'s gun through a crack, then turning to pick up a sharp knife from a bamboo basket.
0:30:13|0:30:15|Prepare to fight at any time.
0:30:15|0:30:18|One person is inside the house holding a knife, while another is outside holding a gun.
0:30:18|0:30:25|[Liang Dong] slowly approached the door, while [Lin Xiang] held a sharp knife in his hand, his eyes sharp and ready to take a life at any moment.
0:30:25|0:30:28|Just as Liang Dong was about to break open the door, someone downstairs suddenly started calling out to him.
0:30:40|0:30:42|[Liang Dong] immediately ran downstairs.
0:31:3|0:31:8|Inside the house, [Lin Xiang] watched as [Liang Dong] walked away, slowly putting down the sharp knife in his hand.
0:31:8|0:31:13|[Liang Dong] rushed to the police station, running through the hall and bumping into many colleagues along the way.
0:31:13|0:31:21|As he reached the stairs wanting to go down, the bearded man who was taking photos at the entrance of Yiji Hall that day called out to him.
0:31:33|0:31:38|[Liang Dong] held a photo and found that all the figures on it were [Lan Fang] and her companions.
0:31:38|0:31:43|He furrowed his brows, stared fiercely at the bearded man with his eyes, and then looked away.
0:32:1|0:32:8|In another part of the lobby, Qin Fengwu and his family of three sat at a table on the second floor, with his son drawing with a pencil and muttering to himself.
0:32:15|0:32:21|The son is drawing himself and his father [Qin Fengwu] on the paper, and also writes "Me and my dear dad".
0:32:21|0:32:26|[Qin Fengwu] smiled and took the lollipop to the chocolate fountain on the table, then handed it to his son.
0:32:29|0:32:35|While the mother, dressed up on the side, had her attention on [Cen Zimo] playing the piano on the first floor.
0:32:35|0:32:38|Her captivating gaze met [Cen Zimo] with a smile.
0:32:38|0:32:44|[Cen Zimo] then noticed the woman looking at him, and he lowered his head expressionlessly to continue playing the piano.
0:32:44|0:32:49|The woman showed no sign of dissatisfaction and instead shifted her gaze back to her son.
0:33:7|0:33:15|[Cen Zimo] first widened his eyes, paused for a moment, then his eye sockets gradually turned red, and then he grinned at [Lin Xiang].
0:33:15|0:33:18|From now on, [Cen Zimo] finally returned to the organization.
0:33:18|0:33:26|On the other side, in the dark prison cell, [Liang Dong] strode ahead, followed by Colonel Yamazaki and a group of Japanese soldiers.
0:33:26|0:33:36|They arrived at a prison cell, where [Lan Fang] and her companions were locked up. They were kneeling on the ground, with their hands tied behind their backs. They looked up at the person entering the cell with a calm and dignified expression.
0:33:37|0:33:45|[Liang Dong] glanced at [Helan Fang], who was kneeling on the ground with wide eyes, then withdrew his gaze and respectfully handed the photo to Captain Yamazaki.
0:33:45|0:33:49|Colonel Yamazaki started comparing photos, then looked at a boy.
0:33:52|0:33:58|The henchmen immediately dragged the young man out, and Colonel Yamazaki opened another photo, ordering to take away a girl.
0:34:35|0:34:45|The soldiers dragged the two of them out directly, while [Liang Dong] stood by indifferently watching everything. Meanwhile, [Helan Fang] who was kneeling on the ground, was already in tears.
0:34:45|0:35:2|Colonel Yamazaki picked up another photo and flipped through it. The Japanese soldiers pulled up the only remaining [Lan Fang] from the cell. Colonel Yamazaki compared the photos in front of him one by one. Standing aside, [Liang Dong] suddenly laughed. He walked slowly towards [Lan Fang] and slapped him directly, his gaze fierce as he spoke.
0:35:13|0:35:19|[Liang Dong] finished speaking, then gave [He Lan Fang] a hard push, and the Japanese soldiers caught her and took her away.
0:35:19|0:35:28|At this moment, only Liang Dong and Colonel Yamazaki were left in the cell. Liang Dong bowed deeply to him, but Colonel Yamazaki ignored him and left directly.
0:35:28|0:35:43|[Liang Dong] stood up straight, looking thoughtful as he watched him walk away. [Lan Fang] emerged alone from the patrol room, her hands clenched into fists and held against her chest. Her clothes were soaked with blood, and large scabs clung to the corners of her mouth. She walked aimlessly down the street, her eyes devoid of expression.
0:35:43|0:35:52|At this moment, a military truck drove past her, and [Lan Fang] looked towards it, only to see her comrades being crushed by the Japanese soldiers on top.
0:35:52|0:35:59|Companions knelt on the car, three Japanese soldiers pointing guns at them. [Lan Fang] couldn't bear it anymore, tears streaming down her face as she chased after the truck and shouted.
0:36:9|0:36:16|[Lan Fang] was shouting and chasing after the truck on the street, while her companions on the truck, who were covered in wounds, looked at her in despair.
0:36:16|0:36:26|She watched as her companions shed tears of self-blame. The root cause of the incident was herself, and now that she was saved, she had to let her companions die in her place. Guilt tormented her heart.
0:36:27|0:36:30|[Lan Fang] ran quickly, but still couldn't catch up with the truck.
0:36:30|0:36:37|At this moment, Liang Dong also emerged from the patrol station and quickly ran towards Lan Fang, embracing her tightly.
0:36:37|0:36:45|The truck slowly disappeared from [Lan Fang]'s sight, [Lan Fang] suddenly broke free from [Liang Dong]'s embrace, and the two looked at each other in silence.
0:36:45|0:36:49|Next, [Lan Fang] gave [Liang Dong] a hard slap and yelled at him.
0:36:54|0:36:58|[Lan Fang] finished cursing and then chased after the truck.
0:36:58|0:37:3|And Liang Dong, upon hearing these words, seemed to be frozen in place, unable to recover for a long time.
0:37:3|0:37:8|Originally, even if he saved [Lan Fang], he couldn't change the image of himself in her heart.
0:37:8|0:37:12|After a while, tears filled his eyes, but stubbornly refused to fall.
0:37:12|0:37:18|[Liang Dong] slowly opened his pursed lips, exhaling heavily as if trying to calm his emotions.
0:37:18|0:37:25|The next day, on the deserted street, the man gave instructions to [Lan Fang], and a comrade sent by the superior arrived.
0:37:34|0:37:42|[Lan Fang], who received the task, changed into an elegant long coat, drawing her eyebrows in front of the mirror and applying lipstick to her lips.
0:37:42|0:37:50|[Lan Fang] finished her makeup, picked up a note that read, "5:00 PM, Morning Light Photo Studio, No. 4, Fangbin Middle Road, Lane 48."
0:37:50|0:37:59|She memorized the content, then picked up the teapot, threw the note into the fireplace, and grabbed a handbag from the table, getting ready to leave.
0:37:59|0:38:2|As soon as the door opened, [Liang Dong] stood in front of the door holding flowers.
0:38:5|0:38:18|[Lan Fang] took the flower wall from [Liang Dong] and threw it on the ground. She lifted her leg to leave, but [Liang Dong] grabbed her wrist. [Lan Fang] tried to break free, and the two arrived in front of some weeds. [Liang Dong] spoke.
0:38:18|0:38:36|They were all captured by the Japanese, and no one could save them. In a flash, there was a scene where [Liang Dong] tore up a photo of [Lan Fang]. [Lan Fang] stood in front of his companions' makeshift tent, with their previous words echoing in his ears.
0:38:51|0:38:58|[Lan Fang] took the flowers from Liang Dong's hands, squatted down and placed them in front of the tombstone, a tear rolling down her face.
0:39:5|0:39:14|After saying that, [Lan Fang] turned around and left, leaving [Liang Dong] standing alone in the desolate and deserted grassland, with only a tree full of leaves standing beside him.
0:39:14|0:39:24|[Lan Fang] arrived at the Morning Light Photography Studio as agreed. She looked at the sign on the street, then walked to the door and knocked. After knocking for a while, no one came to open the door.
0:39:24|0:39:31|She cautiously pushed open the door and walked in, then casually closed the door behind her. The things inside the room were arranged in a highly artistic manner.
0:40:41|0:40:48|[Lan Fang] was pushed down to sit by [Big Cat], she took a deep breath and quietly watched the next move of [Big Cat].
0:41:7|0:41:19|[Lan Fang] nervously tidied her hair and clothes, [Lin Xiang] took out a ring from his pocket, pulled [Lan Fang]'s hand, and put the ring on her ring finger. [Big Cat] looked on and smiled knowingly.
0:41:30|0:41:35|Big Cat looked at Lan Fang's expression in the camera frame, which was very dull, and couldn't help but quip.
0:41:53|0:42:2|Unfortunately, when the photo came out, [Lan Fang] was still sitting expressionless and dull, while [Lin Xiang] next to her was smiling, looking quite cheerful.
0:42:2|0:42:16|The two arrived at [Lin Xiang]'s residence. [Lin Xiang] was tidying up the bed when he turned to look at [He Lan Fang]. At that moment, [He Lan Fang] picked up the just-poured glass of water and was about to turn around, but as soon as she turned, she saw [Lin Xiang]. Upon seeing this, [Lin Xiang] softly spoke.
0:42:28|0:42:42|After speaking, [Lin Xiang] stopped and walked towards the desk. He picked up a small wooden radio-like device and held it close to his chest. Then he pushed open the door of the room, looked around, and gestured to [He Lan Fang] to be quiet.
0:42:44|0:42:50|Following that, [Lin Xiang] walked out of the room, took off his slippers at the doorway, and walked barefoot up to the attic.
0:42:50|0:42:54|He walked halfway and then turned to look at [Lan Fang], nodding at her.
0:42:55|0:43:0|[Lan Fang] watched him walk up the attic stairs, then turned back into the room and closed the door.
0:43:0|0:43:6|Back in the room, [Lan Fang] sat on the bed, took off her coat, tidied it up, and placed it at the foot of the bed.
0:43:6|0:43:14|In the attic, [Lin Xiang] with headphones connected to the radio, holding a paper full of words, began to transmit messages to the outside world.
0:43:14|0:43:18|And so, the two of them disguised as a married couple spent their first peaceful night together.
0:43:19|0:43:24|Early the next morning, [Lin Xiang] came down from the attic and returned to the house.
0:43:24|0:43:27|Lan Fang, who was sleeping in bed, heard a noise and quickly got up.
0:43:27|0:43:33|Even after a nap, [He Lanfang] still neatly wears the lining inside the coat.
0:43:33|0:43:41|[Lin Xiang] placed the small wooden radio on the table, looked out the window, then walked to the bed, with [Lan Fang] watching his face.
0:43:44|0:43:49|At this moment, [Lin Xiang] pointed to the pillow on the bed and asked.
0:43:57|0:44:3|[Lin Xiang] walked to another part of the room with a pillow, while [Lan Fang] lay back on the bed after watching him leave.
0:44:3|0:44:7|After a nap, [Lin Xiang] looks much more refreshed.
0:44:7|0:44:12|He was preparing a meal by the window, when [Lan Fang], attracted by the aroma, walked over and asked.
0:44:15|0:44:20|[Lan Fang] picked up the chopsticks, picked up a vegetable from the pot, and put it into her mouth.
0:45:45|0:45:51|[Lin Xiang] taught [Lan Fang] and then went to the attic to teach [Cen Zimo] how to send telegrams.
0:45:57|0:46:0|[Big Cat] arrived at a clinic and asked the [doctor] to examine him.
0:46:0|0:46:4|[The doctor] finished writing the prescription, stamped it, and handed it to [Big Cat].
0:46:4|0:46:13|[Big Cat] looked at the prescription for a while, then turned his head to the neatly arranged rows of medicine cabinets, each with a numbered label on top.
0:46:13|0:46:17|It compared the medicinal herbs on the prescription with the positions of the cabinets, and obtained a series of numbers.
0:46:18|0:46:24|After returning to the residence, [Big Cat] wrote down these numbers on paper and cross-referenced them with a book to extract information.
0:46:24|0:46:33|She wrote the extracted information on paper, put it in an envelope with the words "Morning Light Photo Studio," and then burned the paper with numbers on it.
0:46:33|0:46:36|Next, she returned to the Morning Light Photo Studio.
0:46:39|0:46:42|Big Cat said to Lan Fang, who came to pick up the photos,
0:46:45|0:46:53|[Lan Fang] left with an envelope containing photos, walking briskly down the street, unaware that [Liang Dong] was following her from behind.
0:46:53|0:47:6|[Lan Fang] got into a yellow cab, while [Liang Dong] was trying to catch up. Unexpectedly, the seemingly drunk [Big Cat] intercepted her.
0:47:6|0:47:9|In the midst of their entanglement, [He Lan Fang] had already boarded the car and left.
0:47:12|0:47:15|Big Cat, thrown to the ground by Liang Dong, complains.
0:47:32|0:47:38|On the street, a group of young people are holding flags and handing out flyers to the passersby.
0:47:38|0:47:44|With a whistle blowing, a group of law enforcement officers rushed out from various streets to stop the parade.
0:47:44|0:47:48|Three female comrades encountered Liang Dong when they were fleeing to a street.
0:47:48|0:47:57|[Liang Dong] stretched out his arm, gesturing for them to come this way, then threw away the flags in their hands to ensure they wouldn't be caught before letting them go.
0:48:1|0:48:7|Several law enforcement officers arrived late, and [Liang Dong] impatiently pointed them in the opposite direction.
0:48:7|0:48:20|After they left, [Big Cat] sitting on the steps of the second-floor window gave him a thumbs-up. [Liang Dong] saw it and took off his sunglasses with a knowing smile. Amid the sound of firecrackers, the tailor shop officially opened.
0:48:20|0:48:25|[Liang Dong] sat in the audience, silently watching [He Lan Fang], with [Big Cat] sitting next to him.
0:48:28|0:48:31|[Liang Dong] turned his head and looked at [Big Cat] without saying a word.
0:48:34|0:48:39|Saying that, [Big Cat] handed half of his youtiao to [Liang Dong].
0:48:39|0:48:45|[Liang Dong] took a youtiao and stuffed it into his mouth, then the scene shifted to a magnificent hall.
0:48:45|0:48:58|On stage, two women in revealing outfits strike poses, with [Masako Akiyama] seated in the second-floor box, while [Qin Fengwu] and her family sit in the adjacent box. [Qin Fengwu] turns her head, squeezes out a smile, and greets [Masako Akiyama].
0:48:59|0:49:7|[Lan Fang] and several other mistresses also arrived here. They sat in the audience seats below the stage, and one of the mistresses spoke up.
0:49:39|0:49:45|[Lan Fang] turned to look at the girl selling snacks, who turned out to be her friend, [Wan Bin].
0:49:55|0:50:4|He [Lan Fang] lowered her head in resignation and touched her hair. Wan Bin glanced at her and finally placed a bag of snacks in her hand.
0:50:4|0:50:8|He Lanfang looked at Wan Bin, wanting to speak but hesitated.
0:50:12|0:50:17|After speaking, the two of them let go of each other's hands as Wan Bin left.
0:50:17|0:50:21|He Lan Fang watched his departing figure, tears gradually welling up in her eyes.
0:50:21|0:50:27|He [Lan Fang] lowered her head, opened the snack package in her hand, took out a sunflower seed, and started cracking it in her mouth.
0:50:27|0:50:33|She paused for a moment, using slow breaths to suppress the unease in her heart.
0:50:33|0:50:37|At that moment, Wan Bin, who was just selling snacks, rushed to the stage and shouted loudly.
0:51:13|0:51:19|In pouring rain, Lan Fang walked out of the auditorium and walked on the deserted street, getting drenched.
0:51:19|0:51:25|She remembered the scene where Wan Bin was shot dead on stage, covering her face with her hands in pain.
0:51:25|0:51:34|She bent over and cried out loud without any reservation, scenes of working together with Wan Bin in the past flashed back in front of her eyes.
0:51:48|0:51:52|When Wan Bin died, he didn't even close his eyes.
0:51:52|0:51:56|[Lan Fang] can no longer hold on, her body falls to the ground.
0:51:56|0:52:2|In the heavy rain, [Lan Fang] knelt on the ground, covering her mouth to breathe.
0:52:2|0:52:5|[Lin Xiang] sat on the sofa in his residence, reading the newspaper.
0:52:5|0:52:9|[Lan Fang] appeared in front of her with her hair scattered and tears on her face.
0:52:9|0:52:12|[Lin Xiang] quickly stepped forward to inquire upon seeing the situation.
0:53:59|0:54:2|[Lan Fang] throws the bag and jewelry on the ground.
0:54:14|0:54:19|[Lan Fang] bent down and picked up the leaflet from her bag, unfolding it in front of [Lin Xiang].
0:54:22|0:54:32|[Lin Xiang] took the flyer from [Lan Fang] and looked down at it for a moment before turning his gaze to the excited [Lan Fang].
0:55:23|0:55:29|Lin Xiang looked at [Lan Fang], and his heart calmed down a bit. He whispered to her.
0:55:32|0:55:41|After speaking, he lowered his head, folded the flyer in his hand, and placed it in [Lan Fang]'s hand. Then he bent down to pick up the scattered bags and jewelry on the ground.
0:55:41|0:55:46|[Lan Fang] held a flyer in her hand, and her mood gradually calmed down.
0:55:46|0:55:50|Late at night, [He Lan Fang] arrived at the attic at the agreed time with [Lin Xiang].
0:55:50|0:55:54|After she closed the door to the attic, she walked deeper into the room.
0:55:54|0:55:58|After bending down to pass through a low doorway, [Lan Fang] quietly sat down next to Lin Xiang.
0:56:0|0:56:5|Even though it was already 2 a.m., [Lin Xiang] was still working diligently.
0:56:5|0:56:13|He wore headphones, with a paper filled with words in front of him, his eyes fixed ahead, his right hand tirelessly pressing the buttons on the radio.
0:56:14|0:56:24|Lan Fang watched the complex and dilapidated machine on the table, as well as Lin Xiang working diligently beside it, she lowered her head, lost in thought.
0:56:24|0:56:42|On this day, [Lan Fang] walked on the bustling street. Along the way, she ran into [Big Cat], who solemnly talked to her about the organization's discipline. [Lan Fang] held a small mirror to see if anyone was following her.
0:57:1|0:57:6|[Lan Fang] plays mahjong with Mrs. Fu during the day and spends the night in the attic with [Lin Xiang].
0:57:26|0:57:31|[Lin Xiang] took the water cup and patiently watched [He Lan Fang] familiarize herself with the basic principles of the radio station.
0:57:31|0:57:37|Originally unfamiliar with each other, the two gradually became familiar and intimate in their daily lives.
0:57:55|0:58:9|On a rainy night, pedestrians hurried along the road. A man wearing a raincoat rode his bicycle quickly and stopped in front of the Morning Light Photo Studio. He threw down his bike and walked quickly into the house, taking out two rolls of film and saying to [Big Cat].
0:58:44|0:58:49|Masako Akiyama kicked Lin Xiang to the ground when she saw him wearing the Nan without saying a word.
0:58:49|0:59:3|On the other side, [Big Cat] held two stacks of overlapping film rolls, recording the information he obtained in numbers, then he opened a book to find the corresponding Chinese characters.
0:59:3|0:59:7|Yu Pinan spat out blood, and [Masako Akiyama] ordered her men to torture him.
0:59:10|0:59:16|Two Japanese soldiers tied Lan Fang to a long bench, and Qin Fengwu slowly walked up to her.
0:59:16|0:59:22|Upon entering the photo studio, Lin Xiang accidentally stepped on an envelope with the words "Morning Light Photo Studio" printed on it.
0:59:22|0:59:26|After Qin Fengwu took off the shoes with the feather cloak, he turned to Masako Akiyama and said.
0:59:30|0:59:44|On the other side, [Big Cat] finally pieced together the information. After staring blankly for a few seconds, he quickly struck a match, set fire to the paper in front of him, and his panicked face was reflected in the flames.
0:59:44|0:59:57|The door of the Morning Light Photo Studio was suddenly kicked open, and [Qin Fengwu] rushed in. After entering, he looked around, then picked up the trash can from the floor and placed it on the table. Seeing the burnt marks on the paper inside, he drew a conclusion.
1:0:9|1:0:16|[Lan Fang] watched the anxious figure of [Big Cat] and felt a sense of foreboding in her heart.
1:0:16|1:0:23|Big Cat came to the restaurant to find Lin Xiang, when suddenly a large group of men in black rushed in from outside.
1:0:23|1:0:26|[Big Cat] ran away, while [Qin Fengwu] shouted loudly from behind.
1:0:29|1:0:37|[Big Cat] ran frantically in the stairwell, pushing open a door to find a place to hide, but the men in black didn't give him the chance.
1:0:37|1:0:43|The scene shifts, [Lin Xiang] is still reminding a wealthy lady [Liang Dong], when [Lan Fang] arrives at the restaurant.
1:0:48|1:0:53|[Big Cat] ran into the lobby of the restaurant, only to be surrounded by men in black holding guns.
1:0:53|1:0:57|After fending off several people with his phone, he jumped directly from the second floor to the lobby on the first floor.
1:0:57|1:1:2|Cen Zimo, who was playing the piano in the lobby, stood up to observe when he heard a noise.
1:1:2|1:1:8|Seeing his companion being surrounded, he quickly stepped forward, but was deterred by the gaze of [Big Cat].
1:1:8|1:1:12|Several men in black clothes pinned [Big Cat] to the ground, with the muzzles of their guns pointed at his chest.
1:1:12|1:1:15|[Big Cat] grabbed the pistol and pulled the trigger at one of them.
1:1:18|1:1:21|A loud noise startled [Lan Fang] and [Lin Xiang].
1:1:21|1:1:27|In the hotel lobby, the crowd was in chaos, with [Big Cat] lying on the ground after wrestling with the weightlifting cart.
1:1:35|1:1:41|[Big Cat], despite being seriously injured, still picked up a gun and fought with them as everyone ran towards the door.
1:1:41|1:1:46|[Lan Fang] walked against the crowd towards the lobby, while [Lin Xiang] was approaching the source of the sound.
1:1:46|1:1:52|After shooting down a man, [Big Cat] covered the wound on his abdomen and encountered [Lin Xiang] at the corner of the stairs.
1:1:52|1:1:57|She looked at [Lin Xiang] and shook her head silently, while [Lin Xiang] nodded with red eyes.
1:2:4|1:2:9|As soon as the words fell, he started grappling with the pursuing [Masako Akiyama].
1:2:9|1:2:20|[Lin Xiang] said to [He Lan Fang] who had just arrived, [Masako Akiyama] kicked towards [Big Cat], then struck her leg heavily on her shoulder, giving her no time to catch her breath, and kicked her directly in the face.
1:2:20|1:2:26|Big Cat fell from the second floor to the first floor, leaving Lin Xiang and Lan Fang in shock as they watched the scene.
1:2:32|1:2:39|[Liang Dong] swaggered into the lobby, pointing his gun towards the second floor, smiling as he nodded towards [Masako Akiyama].
1:2:54|1:3:1|Big Cat slowly stood up in response, while [Masako Akiyama] and [Qin Fengwu] on the second floor watched with great interest.
1:3:1|1:3:8|[Liang Dong] stared sharply at Big Cat, who was weakly unable to stand up straight.
1:3:8|1:3:12|Big Cat asks [Liang Dong] to shoot, but [Liang Dong] remains silent.
1:3:12|1:3:14|Big Cat looks at the scene.
1:3:24|1:3:28|[Liang Dong] was forced by him until his eyes were bloodshot, but he didn't pull the trigger of the gun.
1:3:28|1:3:33|Suddenly, Big Cat, with his hands covered in blood, pulled Liang Dong's gun to his own chest.
1:3:33|1:3:38|He then smiled at [Lin Xiang] and [Lan Fang], and pulled the trigger of the pistol.
1:3:40|1:3:49|In an instant, blood splattered onto Liang Dong's face, Lin Xiang quickly covered Lan Fang's eyes with his hands, leaving everyone present in shock.
1:3:49|1:3:57|Big Cat's body gradually lost its vitality, falling backwards with his face splattered with blood, while Liang Dong was still in shock.
1:3:57|1:4:1|He looked at the fallen Big Cat, the handgun in his hand had slipped to the ground.
1:4:2|1:4:7|In the lobby, the huge fish tank suddenly shattered, splashing water onto Big Cat's body.
1:4:7|1:4:13|[Lin Xiang] watched this scene, gritting his teeth, the atmosphere making him tremble all over, his eyes bloodshot.
1:4:13|1:4:18|But in order to conceal his identity, he had to watch helplessly as his companions sacrificed themselves.
1:4:18|1:4:25|The eyes of [Lan Fang], who were covered, even without seeing the bloodiest scene, just hearing the gunshots was enough for him to know the final outcome.
1:4:26|1:4:32|His hand rested on [Lin Xiang]'s hand, and his silent weeping made his whole body tremble.
1:4:32|1:4:37|[Cen Zimo] frowned helplessly.
1:4:37|1:4:42|At night, heavy rain fell from the sky, and there were no pedestrians on the streets.
1:4:42|1:4:50|At the entrance of the restaurant, staff members carried out bodies one by one and loaded them onto a truck, with Big Cat's body among them.
1:4:50|1:4:52|[Lin Xiang] stood in the dark, holding an umbrella, observing their movements.
1:4:53|1:5:2|After the staff finished playing the corpse, they covered the back of the truck and drove to a dilapidated and deserted building.
1:5:2|1:5:8|They stood on the truck and casually threw the bodies onto the ground, gradually forming a small hill of corpses.
1:5:9|1:5:13|[Liang Dong] returned home and washed his face in the water tank at home.
1:5:13|1:5:21|He recalled the scene from earlier in the day, feeling a deep sense of guilt welling up inside, causing him to vomit uncontrollably.
1:5:21|1:5:26|After hearing the sound, Liang Dong turned to the mother and asked,
1:6:8|1:6:14|Liang Dong couldn't help but hug his mother's thigh and cried out loudly as he listened to what she said.
1:6:14|1:6:20|On the other side, [Lin Xiang] followed the truck to a place with many bodies, where [Big Cat] was lying on top of many corpses.
1:6:20|1:6:25|[Lin Xiang] put down the umbrella, stood in the pouring rain, and walked slowly to the body.
1:6:25|1:6:30|He remembered the scene today when [Big Cat] sacrificed himself and his companions were unwilling to help him.
1:6:30|1:6:32|[Lin Xiang] slowly squatted down, looking at the body of [Big Cat].
1:6:33|1:6:39|Rolling around on [Big Cat]'s body, eventually finding a piece of cloth in the pocket on the chest.
1:6:39|1:6:44|He tightly gripped the cloth strip, his hands trembling as he looked at the face of [Big Cat], who would never wake up again.
1:6:44|1:6:51|After a while, [Lin Xiang], in order not to miss any information, continued to search on [Big Cat] for clues.
1:6:51|1:6:57|While searching, [Lin Xiang] suddenly lost control of his emotions, lying on [Big Cat]'s body, unable to recover for a long time.
1:6:58|1:7:3|After making sure no clues were missed, she returned to her residence with a heavy heart.
1:7:3|1:7:10|She changed her clothes, then took a basin of clean water and washed the cloth strips found in the body.
1:7:10|1:7:15|[Lin Xiang] tears streaming down his face, cleans the cloth strip, on which is printed the words "East Wind Rain, Pearl Class".
1:7:16|1:7:27|He recalled the scene of his first encounter with [Big Cat], and the memories of [Big Cat] playing mahjong with [He Lanfang], everything was so clear, as if it happened just yesterday.
1:7:27|1:7:36|[Lan Fang] sat in front of the sewing machine, staring blankly. On top of it was the sweater she knitted for [Big Cat], but unfortunately, [Big Cat] would never have the chance to wear it again.
1:7:36|1:7:42|[Lin Xiang] looked at the terrified [Lan Fang], then whispered to her,
1:7:50|1:7:54|[Lan Fang] didn't give a firm answer, but walked out of the room directly.
1:7:54|1:7:59|Cen Zimo glanced at [Lin Xiang], then followed [Lan Fang] out.
1:7:59|1:8:6|On the street, a Japanese military radio signal vehicle is driving, while [Lin Xiang] has arrived at the attic.
1:8:6|1:8:12|He put on the headphones, turned on the radio, and then, referring to the note, passed on the information he had obtained to the outside world.
1:8:31|1:8:41|As soon as the words fell, Masako Akiyama saw the city in front of her being divided into blackout zones, with Lin Xiang trying to make a phone call and Liang Dong lying at home, both unaware of what was happening.
1:8:41|1:8:54|After a while, the power came back on. Sensing trouble, [Liang Dong] got up, grabbed his clothes, and left the room. Meanwhile, [Lin Xiang] was passing on intelligence in the attic. The indicator lights on the radio were flashing rapidly, indicating an unusually urgent situation.
1:8:55|1:9:2|The Japanese army's mobile radio signal vehicle is patrolling every street, with Japanese soldiers conducting urgent searches on the vehicle.
1:9:2|1:9:6|[Lin Xiang] felt uneasy and pretended to be calm as he sent a telegram on the attic.
1:9:41|1:9:49|[Masako Akiyama] smirked evilly and ordered her subordinates to pass on the message that the underground radio station had appeared in the rental area, calling for other units to cross-locate.
1:9:49|1:9:55|A large number of Japanese soldiers rushed to the residence of [Lin Xiang], while [Lin Xiang] was still passing on important information in the attic.
1:9:55|1:9:59|Our soldiers in the distance saluted the commander.
1:10:8|1:10:11|Qian Zimo and [Lan Fang] looked at the beams of light in the residence.
1:10:13|1:10:16|[Cen Zimo] finished speaking and hurried to the tailor's shop.
1:10:16|1:10:18|[Lan Fang] followed behind.
1:10:18|1:10:23|At this moment, several military trucks have arrived at the entrance of the tailor shop heading north.
1:10:23|1:10:29|The Japanese soldiers above turned on a huge spotlight, illuminating the face of [Lin Xiang] through the window.
1:10:29|1:10:32|A large number of Japanese soldiers with guns stormed into the tailor shop.
1:10:32|1:10:35|[Cen Zimo] and [Lan Fang] are running wildly on the street.
1:10:35|1:10:40|[Lin Xiang] finished sending the last telegram in the attic, then burned the paper in a small cup.
1:10:45|1:10:51|The leader held the telegram handed over by the soldier, which read, "Comrade, goodbye," signed by [Liu Yang].
1:10:51|1:10:56|All the soldiers around stood up in mourning, and the whole room was filled with sadness.
1:10:56|1:11:3|The Japanese army was ransacking the tailor shop, while [Lan Fang] and [Cen Zimo] stood at a distance, watching the scene with heartache.
1:11:3|1:11:8|[Lin Xiang] poured the ashes of burnt paper into water and then drank it.
1:11:8|1:11:11|Next, he dismantled the parts of the radio.
1:11:37|1:11:40|The Japanese soldiers handed over the captured radio transmitter to their leader.
1:11:40|1:11:45|[Lin Xiang] saw that things had come to this point, his eyes became even more determined.
1:11:45|1:11:50|[Liang Dong] rushed to [Lan Fang]'s tailor shop, only to find that the storefront had been sealed with a closure notice.
1:11:50|1:11:53|He stood at the door, hesitating, lost in thought.
1:11:54|1:12:0|Inside the Japanese Navy Special Marine Corps Headquarters, there are two rows of Japanese soldiers standing in the courtyard.
1:12:0|1:12:6|In the room, [Lin Xiang] is shirtless, his body suspended in the air, with his hands hanging on the iron cushion.
1:12:6|1:12:14|The Japanese soldiers picked up two long electrified steel pipes and pressed them against [Lin Xiang].
1:12:14|1:12:16|[Lin Xiang] was shocked and trembling, crying out.
1:12:18|1:12:26|When [Lin Xiang] didn't tell the truth, the Japanese soldiers picked up a cushion and started hitting him, while [Qin Fengwu] fearlessly held a box.
1:12:57|1:13:0|[Qin Fengwu] placed the box on the torture table and then opened it.
1:13:0|1:13:6|After opening it, there were rolls of linen inside, rubbing a lotus-shaped iron handle.
1:13:6|1:13:14|He picked up the lotus handle and slowly walked to [Lin Xiang]'s front, then scratched the iron-made petal tip on [Lin Xiang]'s body, one after another.
1:13:15|1:13:18|Lin Xiang's body is now a bloody mess.
1:13:18|1:13:27|Next, [Qin Fengwu] casually threw the lotus handle into the box, then picked up the white granules and sprinkled them on [Lin Xiang]'s body, the white granules adhering to the flesh.
1:13:27|1:13:34|At this moment, [Qin Fengwu] picked up a piece of burlap and placed it on [Lin Xiang]'s wound, then used the lotus handle to stick the wound and burlap together.
1:13:34|1:13:37|Lin Xiang was panting heavily due to the pain.
1:13:37|1:13:39|Qin Fengwu spoke up when he saw that he was still being stubborn.
1:13:45|1:13:48|Lin Xiang also passed out temporarily because he couldn't hold on any longer.
1:13:48|1:13:55|On the other side, because Lin Xiang was captured by the Japanese army, Cen Zimo lamented to [Lan Fang].
1:14:3|1:14:5|Cen Zimo ran into Liang Dong when he went out.
1:14:5|1:14:6|Cen Zimo stared with wide eyes and asked [Liang Dong].
1:14:37|1:14:44|[Lan Fang] ran past two people and rushed out, only to encounter a car on the way. Chen Zimo quickly stepped forward and asked.
1:14:54|1:14:59|Learning that the woman laughing in the car is the confidante of [Qin Fengwu].
1:14:59|1:15:3|[Cen Zimo] turned his head and gestured to [Liang Dong], who smiled and stepped forward.
1:15:13|1:15:19|[Cen Zimo] imitated [Lin Xiang]'s Morse code in a hidden room, and the Japanese army also detected the signal.
1:15:40|1:15:48|The Japanese radio station commander bluntly stated that they had captured the wrong person, and [Masako Akiyama] shouted, "It must be him."
1:15:48|1:15:52|[Lan Fang] came to [Masako Akiyama]'s office in gorgeous attire.
1:15:59|1:16:2|Masako Akiyama took the note handed to her by Lan Fang without saying a word.
1:16:17|1:16:22|[Lan Fang] picked up the cigarette on the table, lit it, and started blowing smoke rings as soon as it entered her mouth.
1:16:22|1:16:27|Masako Akiyama stood up from her seat and walked around the table to Lan Fang's side.
1:16:27|1:16:30|[Lan Fang] took a puff of her cigarette and turned to her.
1:16:44|1:16:56|Zhu Zong, Tong You, Shengqi, [He Lan Fang] finished speaking and blew a smoke ring, [Masako Akiyama] took her to the prison cell.
1:16:56|1:17:5|[Lan Fang] saw from a distance that [Lin Xiang] was hanging in the center of the cell. She ran up excitedly, but was startled when she saw the injuries on [Lin Xiang].
1:17:5|1:17:9|She calmed down for a moment, then whispered to [Lin Xiang].
1:17:16|1:17:23|[Lan Fang] said excitedly, and [Qin Fengwu] stepped forward, holding her arms with both hands, trying to calm her down.
1:17:23|1:17:27|He [Lan Fang] looked at her with tears in his eyes, glaring fiercely.
1:17:27|1:17:31|Next, [Qin Fengwu] took a cup of water and splashed it on the still unconscious [Lin Xiang].
1:17:31|1:17:34|She stared at [Lin Xiang] intently and then whispered.
1:17:43|1:17:52|Qin Fengwu uncovered the wet linen on Lin Xiang's body, causing Lan Fang to scream in terror.
1:17:52|1:17:59|[Lin Xiang] looked [Qin Fengwu] firmly in the eyes. Seeing that he still refused to speak, [Qin Fengwu] reached out and removed all the remaining sackcloth from [Lin Xiang].
1:18:2|1:18:6|[Lin Xiang] grimaced in pain, sweat covering his entire face.
1:18:6|1:18:10|He [Lan Fang] shed tears as she looked at his restrained expression.
1:18:21|1:18:38|Please [Qin Fengwu] rolled his eyes, turned around and looked behind him with an impatient expression on his face. He threw the piece of cloth in his hand to the ground, then turned around and uncovered the pieces of cloth on [Lin Xiang]'s body one by one. [Lan Fang] immediately stopped him.
1:18:38|1:18:45|The Japanese army stated that they have connected to the Taigong Pier and handed the phone to [Masako Akiyama]. [Lan Fang] quickly stepped forward and spoke through the phone.
1:18:51|1:18:53|Masako Akiyama snatched the phone again.
1:19:3|1:19:9|Qin Fengwu tears off a piece of burlap from [Lin Xiang], and [Lan Fang] quickly catches it.
1:19:15|1:19:27|Masako Akiyama interrupted him, then looked at the dying Lin Xiang, who was tortured beyond recognition, his eyes unfocused. Everyone's gaze was on him at this moment, as he uttered a few numbers.
1:19:52|1:19:56|Qin Fengwu turned around and walked to the table, shaking the telephone in front of her.
1:20:13|1:20:19|Upon hearing the cries for help, Qin Fengwu appeared visibly flustered, holding the phone as she continued to listen to what Liang Dong was saying.
1:20:25|1:20:30|Qin Fengwu turned to look at [Lin Xiang], who met his gaze with a determined look.
1:20:30|1:20:35|On the other side, after Liang Dong finished speaking on the phone, Qin Fengwu's concubine also stopped screaming.
1:20:35|1:20:40|Outside the door, [Cen Zimo] and a foreigner are eating with Qin Feng's dancing son.
1:20:40|1:20:49|Qin Fengwu stood in the cell, lost in thought. Before long, he walked towards [Lin Xiang] and started to curse loudly.
1:21:15|1:21:20|After Masako Akiyama finished speaking, both Qin Fengwu and [Helan Fang] showed different thoughts.
1:21:20|1:21:26|A large number of Japanese soldiers arrived at the dock to search for goods, Masako Akiyama and others stood on the second-floor platform.
1:21:26|1:21:32|At this moment, [Qin Fengwu] and [He Lanfang] were very nervous, as the Japanese soldiers searched for a while but found nothing.
1:21:32|1:21:35|Masako Akiyama asked in a deep voice.
1:21:35|1:21:41|Qin Fengwu's expression was indescribable, Masako Akiyama was feeling unwell, and the sword was held against Lan Fang's neck.
1:21:50|1:21:51|Downstairs, the Japanese soldiers shouted loudly.
1:21:53|1:22:14|Masako Akiyama put down the long knife, then walked downstairs towards the direction of the goods, followed closely by Qin Fengwu and Lan Fang. The Japanese soldiers opened a can of gasoline, Masako Akiyama held the long knife and stabbed it into the opening of the oil drum, then pulled out the knife and lit it. The knife was instantly engulfed in flames. At this moment, Lan Fang spoke.
1:22:14|1:22:18|Masako Akiyama glanced at Lan Fang, then turned to Qin Fengwu and said.
1:22:25|1:22:29|Masako Akiyama turned and left the dock after giving the order.
1:22:29|1:22:36|At night, on a narrow country road, [Cen Zimo] was driving a small truck carrying goods slowly.
1:22:36|1:22:41|[Lin Xiang] lay weakly in the car, while [Lan Fang] held a water bottle for him to drink.
1:22:41|1:22:44|[Lin Xiang] gazed affectionately at [Helan Fang] and said,
1:23:6|1:23:10|The two of them looked deeply into each other's eyes with unspeakable affection.
1:23:10|1:23:15|[Lin Xiang] slightly raised his left hand, and [Lan Fang] quickly used her hand to hold him down.
1:23:15|1:23:19|Her bright eyes fixed on [Lin Xiang], then slowly lay down beside him.
1:23:19|1:23:25|At this moment, their eyes never left each other, while the car continued to move slowly.
1:23:25|1:23:29|After gazing deeply at each other, [Lin Xiang] slowly spoke.
1:23:51|1:23:57|[Masako Akiyama], sitting in the chair, was so angry that her face twisted upon hearing these words.
1:24:13|1:24:17|In the hail of bullets, the car is riddled with bullet holes.
1:24:17|1:24:23|[Qin Fengwu] lay on the side with wide open eyes, no longer breathing, and her son was nowhere to be found.
1:24:24|1:24:30|The beautiful scenery by the roadside is peaceful at this moment, as if nothing has ever happened.
1:24:30|1:24:36|In Shanghai, the Japanese army posted wanted posters of [Lin Xiang] and [Lan Fang] on the streets.
1:24:54|1:25:7|Lin Xiang looked at Liang Dong, who was speaking, without answering.
1:25:7|1:25:10|After Liang Dong finished speaking, he lowered his head and fell into contemplation.
1:25:10|1:25:13|Lin Xiang looked at his expression and slowly asked.
1:25:37|1:25:42|[Liang Dong] listened to these words, then turned his gaze subtly towards [Lin Xiang].
1:25:42|1:25:45|The scene shifts to a beautiful lakeside.
1:26:13|1:26:16|In the photo is a man who is as thin as a rake.
1:26:16|1:26:18|The head of the Nanjing puppet government.
1:26:19|1:26:23|Huizi risked her life to take a picture of this man with a camera.
1:26:23|1:26:26|[Lin Xiang] turned around and entered a room.
1:26:56|1:27:0|[Lin Xiang] is inside the house, passing on the intelligence to the superior.
1:27:0|1:27:5|In the city of Shanghai, many pieces of paper scattered in the sky, slowly falling into the hands of [Liang Dong].
1:27:5|1:27:9|The paper was printed with a photo of Wang Jingwei on the sickle, resembling a devil.
1:27:9|1:27:10|The following is written:
1:27:14|1:27:19|[Masako Akiyama] lay on the luxurious sofa, puffing on a long cigarette holder.
1:27:19|1:27:21|The latest news is being broadcast on the radio.
1:27:51|1:27:55|In the bustling street, the Japanese army is inspecting the passing civilians.
1:27:55|1:27:59|Next to the big truck, there are many Japanese soldiers ready to be on standby.
1:27:59|1:28:5|The streets are covered with many wanted posters, and all the shops on the street are closed.
1:28:5|1:28:10|A foreigner drove a large truck filled with big iron barrels slowly approaching.
1:28:10|1:28:15|After driving the car to a checkpoint, the Japanese soldiers raised their hands to stop the vehicle, then approached and asked.
1:28:22|1:28:29|With a wave of the Japanese commander's hand, a group of men stabbed the wine barrels on the car with knives, causing [Qin Fengwu], who was hiding inside the barrel, to scream.
1:28:37|1:28:43|The foreigner saw the situation and immediately pulled the handbrake, started the truck, and crashed through the fence.
1:28:50|1:29:8|The truck is speeding down the street, pedestrians around are dodging. [Lin Xiang] and [Cen Zimo], who are hiding in a barrel, come out. Japanese soldiers start shooting at them. [Lin Xiang] and [Cen Zimo] push the barrels off the truck, and the barrels roll down the ground towards the Japanese soldier riding a motorcycle.
1:29:8|1:29:15|The Japanese soldiers were thrown into chaos by this incident, as the truck carrying several Japanese officers crashed into the iron barrel on the side of the street.
1:29:31|1:29:35|Masako Akiyama, who received the message, immediately set off for the outskirts.
1:29:35|1:29:38|Lin Xiang and the others arrived at the abandoned factory, where the foreigner opened the iron gate.
1:30:2|1:30:8|Several people are inspecting the plane, unaware that [Masako Akiyama] is approaching with someone.
1:30:8|1:30:8|[Lin Xiang] asks the foreigner.
1:30:17|1:30:22|[Lin Xiang] looked at the drunken foreigner, pondered for a moment, and then turned away.
1:30:41|1:31:0|After speaking, [Lin Xiang] stood on the plane and reached out his hand to [Lan Fang]. Tears welled up in [Lan Fang]'s eyes as she looked at [Lin Xiang] for a long time without saying a word. Then she nodded slightly, held [Lin Xiang]'s hand, and the two female comrades finally boarded the plane as a large number of Japanese soldiers stormed through the abandoned factory, smashing the gate to pieces.
1:31:0|1:31:14|[Lin Xiang] held [Lan Fang]'s hand and rubbed it, the two looked at each other, their eyes showing reluctance. [Lan Fang] nodded slightly at [Lin Xiang], after a moment of tenderness, [Lin Xiang] no longer hesitated, but turned and left.
1:31:14|1:31:17|Lan Fang's eyes followed Lin Xiang, eventually shedding tears.
1:31:19|1:31:26|The plane is about to start, [Lin Xiang] and [Cen Zimo] open the front door, and the foreigner starts the plane in reverse.
1:31:26|1:31:31|At this moment, [Masako Akiyama] led a large number of Japanese soldiers to surround them.
1:31:31|1:31:36|The plane slowly drove onto the abandoned street and suddenly turned into a large Japanese military truck.
1:31:40|1:31:44|[Lin Xiang] and [Cen Zimo] were about to leave, but they ran into the Japanese army right after they walked out of the factory.
1:31:44|1:31:50|Bullets rained down on them, with explosions going off one after another.
1:31:50|1:31:54|[Lin Xiang] and [Cen Zimo] narrowly escaped danger with their agile skills.
1:31:54|1:32:0|On the other side, the Japanese army mounted a heavy machine gun on a truck, crazily shooting at the planes flying towards the camp.
1:32:0|1:32:5|Just as the two of them were about to collide, the plane suddenly made a turn and veered onto another street.
1:32:6|1:32:10|The Japanese soldiers were following closely behind, continuously shooting at them.
1:32:10|1:32:16|With no way out in front, the foreigner piloting the plane remained calm and flew straight into the wall.
1:32:16|1:32:23|Masako Akiyama looked at the scene in front of her, directly kicked her own driver out, and sat in the driver's seat to drive.
1:32:28|1:32:34|[Masako Akiyama] drove the car expressionlessly and quickly towards the plane, the vehicle hitting the rear wheel of the aircraft.
1:32:34|1:32:39|[Lan Fang] and Hui Zi turned to look at the already insane [Masako Akiyama], feeling a sense of impending doom.
1:32:39|1:32:47|After several impacts, the bumper of the vehicle driven by [Masako Akiyama] hooked onto the metal piece at the back of the plane.
1:32:50|1:33:0|[Masako Akiyama] stepped on the brake, and the vehicle came to a stop, causing the plane behind to also stop due to being hooked from the rear.
1:33:17|1:33:22|Pierre, the pilot, happily agreed upon hearing this, then ran towards the Japanese military vehicle, sat in the driver's seat, stepped on the gas pedal to start the vehicle. Lan Fang and Huizi, seeing this, quickly sat down in the plane.
1:33:30|1:33:33|[Lin Xiang] is driving a vehicle, pushing the plane forward.
1:33:33|1:33:37|Masako Akiyama quickly ran to the vehicle after getting up from the ground.
1:33:37|1:33:40|Stepping forward with one leg, [Lin Xiang] climbed onto the car.
1:33:40|1:33:43|Then he grabbed [Lin Xiang]'s neck with both hands.
1:33:43|1:33:47|[Lan Fang] turned her head to look at the scene, her eyes filled with worry.
1:33:47|1:33:50|[Lin Xiang] held the steering wheel with one hand and picked up the sharp knife from the cushion with the other.
1:33:51|1:33:58|He jammed the dagger on the throttle, a copper blade leaped up and tripped behind [Masako Akiyama].
1:33:58|1:34:6|The two [Lin Xiang] and [Lan Fang] were competing at the back of the vehicle. As the vehicle moved, the front wheel of the plane gradually lifted up, looking like it could take off at any moment.
1:34:7|1:34:16|Masako Akiyama quickly removed the dagger stuck in the accelerator, causing the vehicle to slow down gradually, and the front wheel of the plane also landed slowly on the ground.
1:34:16|1:34:22|[Lin Xiang] stepped on the accelerator after breaking the sharp knife, and the vehicle continued to move forward.
1:34:23|1:34:31|Masako Akiyama and Lin Xiang were fighting fiercely, and a large number of Japanese troops gathered here from elsewhere, preparing to ambush the aircraft.
1:34:31|1:34:37|[Cen Zimo] also ran over from another street, his eyes shining brightly as he thought about what to do.
1:34:38|1:34:41|At this moment, an enemy's large truck drove over.
1:34:41|1:34:47|[Cen Zimo] didn't hesitate, climbed onto the truck directly, and kicked the Japanese soldier holding the machine gun away.
1:34:52|1:34:54|[Liang Dong] rode over on a motorcycle to clear the way in front of the plane.
1:34:56|1:34:59|He took out his gun and took down all the Japanese soldiers coming towards him.
1:34:59|1:35:5|The motorcycle became uncontrollable due to being shot at, and [Liang Dong] eventually jumped off.
1:35:5|1:35:11|On the other side, after [Cen Zimo] took out the two people in the driver's cabin of the car, he also jumped out of the car to save his life.
1:35:11|1:35:13|Masako Akiyama is fighting with Lin Xiang with a knife.
1:35:14|1:35:20|Lin Xiang bent down to dodge, then was kicked and knocked unconscious against the glass of the vehicle.
1:35:20|1:35:27|Masako Akiyama kicked the glass to continue to kick him, Lin Xiang seized the opportunity and tightly grabbed his leg.
1:35:27|1:35:33|At this moment, the plane slowly lifts off the ground, gradually disconnecting from the vehicles, and then flies towards the sky.
1:35:34|1:35:42|Lin Xiang watched as the vehicle was about to crash into the wall, so he bent Masako Akiyama's leg and then jumped out of the car and rolled to the ground.
1:35:42|1:35:48|Masako Akiyama with a broken leg didn't react in time, and was hit by the vehicle into the wall, then fell into the sea.
1:35:56|1:36:2|The three of them watched as the plane slowly disappeared from view, supporting each other and feeling the relaxed sense of surviving a disaster.
1:36:2|1:36:6|In the reflection of the setting sun, the silhouettes of the three figures appeared particularly majestic.
1:36:6|1:36:11|On September 2, 1945, Japan was signing the instrument of surrender unconditionally, and the screen gradually darkened.
1:36:11|1:36:17|When the lights came on, [Lin Xiang] sat in a simple room, pulling the curtains closed, casting a dim light over the entire room.
1:36:17|1:36:24|Only the lamp on the table behind [Lin Xiang] is lit. He sits at the table, wearing headphones, fingers pressing the radio, sending a telegram to [He Lan Fang].
1:36:51|1:37:10|The camera slowly pulls towards the window, the room that was originally covered by curtains suddenly becomes bright. Looking out through the window, the people on the street are all setting off firecrackers to celebrate. This scene is dedicated to the unknown heroes on the hidden front line, as well as all those who have fought for a new life.
