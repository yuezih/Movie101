0:1:32|0:1:38|As the night deepens, [Ma Shanglai] in tattered clothes chats via video with a friend on the computer screen.
0:1:38|0:1:41|The camera slowly pans down as the friend clears his throat.
0:2:30|0:2:34|The scene shifts, and the ringing of the phone inside the house catches the attention of the teenager.
0:2:34|0:2:43|He stopped exercising and walked from the balcony filled with green plants into the living room, picking up the phone while also grabbing an apple.
0:2:47|0:2:59|With the words barely spoken, [Ma Shanglai] had already put on his shirt, pulled the key off the cabinet with his right hand, picked up a long-handled umbrella, and used the curved end of the umbrella to hook the helmet on the coat rack. He then went downstairs, got on his motorcycle, and rode off in a cloud of dust.
0:3:21|0:3:30|[Ma Shanglai] turned his head to look at the villain, [Ma Shanglai] knocked on the window by the road, and the person inside the house opened the window, accidentally knocking down the villain.
0:3:30|0:3:43|The female victim arrived and kicked the thug fiercely twice. At this moment, a young mother was walking with her baby, completely focused on her phone and unaware of the basketball flying towards her. A figure swiftly passed by, and [Ma Shanglai] who was passing by caught the basketball steadily.
0:3:43|0:3:48|On the zebra crossing, [Ma Shanglai] passing by covered a manhole with a car tire, which happened to help a blind person passing by.
0:3:49|0:3:55|The scene shifts, with people coming and going on the peaceful street. Inside a small house by the road, a couple is having a quarrel.
0:3:55|0:3:59|The Quarrel Queen threw a transparent water cup, piercing through the glass and across the street.
0:3:59|0:4:3|The five characters of "Ma Shanglai" appear slowly on the screen as the camera moves.
0:4:4|0:4:10|The water glass continued to move and burst open beside the man brushing his teeth on the other side of the street.
0:4:10|0:4:16|The man was startled, spraying mouthwash all over the wall, and he turned his head to look.
0:4:16|0:4:17|He walked across the street.
0:4:24|0:4:41|As soon as the words fell, Ma Shanglai rode his motorcycle past, Yupeng took away the wig of the man brushing his teeth, and he became bald.
0:4:41|0:4:45|The bald man closely follows [Ma Shanglai].
0:4:45|0:4:50|The neighbors gathered around, eagerly anticipating Ma Shanglai's next move.
0:4:57|0:5:1|The wolf [Ma Shanglai] opens the door and quickly dodges.
0:5:1|0:5:11|Brooms, brooms, iron pots, one item after another flying out, and the sound of each item landing causing a stir among the neighbors.
0:5:11|0:5:20|The wolf [Ma Shanglai] turned his head to enter the door, only to have a bowl of noodles fly out and land right on his head, drawing mocking glances from the onlookers.
0:5:20|0:5:23|Ma Shanglai, with noodles hanging on his face, turned his head slowly and said.
0:5:28|0:5:36|The neighbors burst into laughter at the words, and [Ma Shanglai] also entered the house to mediate.
0:5:36|0:5:39|The scene slowly zooms out and freezes, with [Ma Shanglai] walking into the frame from off-screen.
0:5:59|0:6:4|The young couple pushed the door open, and when the woman saw the noodles on [Ma Shanglai]'s head, she immediately tidied up.
0:6:17|0:6:29|[Ma Shanglai]'s banter escalated into a big fight, and the scene shifted to two gangs carrying weapons with fierce expressions walking towards each other.
0:6:29|0:6:39|[Ma Shanglai] squeezed towards the middle.
0:6:39|0:6:40|Two groups of people were intimidated and driven away by [Ma Shanglai].
0:6:56|0:6:59|The two groups immediately started fighting.
0:6:59|0:7:4|On the narrow bridge, the two sides were engaged in a fierce battle, with [Ma Shanglai] weaving through the crowd with a crouched posture.
0:7:4|0:7:8|The melee continues, with both sides using tactics to attack each other.
0:7:9|0:7:17|[Ma Shanglai] was pushed to the edge of the bridge by the crowd, and suddenly fell into the water. While the leaders of both sides were fighting, an old man noticed [Ma Shanglai] struggling in the water.
0:7:27|0:7:34|Ma Shanglai's hat floated on the water, but he was nowhere to be seen.
0:7:34|0:7:41|After the boss spoke, he immediately jumped into the water, followed closely by his henchmen, filling the water surface like dumplings one by one.
0:7:41|0:7:43|On the other side, [Ma Shanglai] relied on his pipe to move forward underwater.
0:8:7|0:8:12|The scene cuts to a woman with her makeup ruined standing on top of a tall building.
0:8:12|0:8:33|36G is a good thing, just say it now. I used the tactic of luring the tiger out of the mountain. [Ma Shanglai] slowly approaches, scaring the woman. A gun falls from the high building, and [Ma Shanglai] immediately rushes out, grabbing the woman's hand. The two of them hang on the balcony like this.
0:8:33|0:8:38|Downstairs, the onlookers looked up, discussing animatedly, while the firefighters were making urgent rescue preparations.
0:8:40|0:8:48|Amid a series of screams, [Ma Shanglai] finally couldn't hold on any longer and fell from a height of tens of meters along with the woman. The safety air cushion securely caught the two of them.
0:9:6|0:9:12|On the commercial street, a girl in a long dress is not shy about twisting her waist, full of youthful vigor.
0:10:8|0:10:11|[Ma Shanglai] turned and walked away, with the bald man closely following.
0:10:12|0:10:16|The young couple on stage, dancing along with the music band, looked very happy.
0:10:16|0:10:25|As the night fell, [Ma Shanglai] returned home and prepared a basin of foot-washing water. He carried the wooden tub to the balcony where [Ma Shanglai's Wife] was enjoying the view.
0:10:26|0:10:32|Before they even started, [Ma Shanglai's Wife] switched places with [Ma Shanglai] and began to wash his feet for him.
0:10:36|0:10:38|[Ma Shanglai] immediately understood upon hearing this.
0:10:38|0:10:43|[Ma Shanglai] is enjoying a foot washing service from [Ma Shanglai's Wife].
0:11:4|0:11:20|[Ma Shanglai's Wife] smiled knowingly at the words, walked towards [Ma Shanglai], her feet flying down like water, and in an instant, [Ma Shanglai] turned into a braised chicken.
0:11:20|0:11:20|The next day,
0:11:31|0:11:35|On the path by the river, [Ma Shanglai's Apprentice] just lifted the billboard with his hands and chased after [Ma Shanglai] speeding on his motorcycle.
0:11:53|0:12:7|In the classroom, Ma Shanglai's Wife is packing up books.
0:12:7|0:12:11|Ma Shanglai's Wife looked solemn, Fei Pinxiao understood.
0:12:23|0:12:38|The old [Ma Shanglai's Wife] continued to bargain, and Fei Pin stopped his actions, feeling the seriousness of the other party, he continued to probe.
0:12:38|0:12:43|Fei Pinxiao seemed to have hit the jackpot, his fingers nervously fidgeting, unable to believe all of this.
0:12:47|0:12:54|Ma Shanglai's Wife sent out another pillow.
0:12:59|0:13:4|Ma Shanglai's Wife's straightforwardness stunned her son, leaving him at a loss for words, while Fei Pinxiao returned home with a full load.
0:13:5|0:13:9|They returned to the tricycle laughing all the way.
0:13:9|0:13:12|He was sorting through the collected scrap materials.
0:13:12|0:13:18|The mother and son in the house ran out anxiously at this moment.
0:14:3|0:14:11|The neighbors applauded, the dance team danced every day, and [Ma Shanglai] and his friends took selfies together.
0:14:11|0:14:14|In the barbershop, [Ma Shanglai]'s son is accompanying his mother to get a perm.
0:14:14|0:14:15|The son is holding a cellphone.
0:14:15|0:14:18|Son, pass the phone to [Ma Shanglai's Wife].
0:14:28|0:14:38|Entering the palace, [Ma Shanglai] was about to speak.
0:14:38|0:14:48|Ma Shanglai, who was speaking, was interrupted by a song. The girls in long skirts surrounded Ma Shanglai and started dancing, leaving him somewhat bewildered.
0:14:48|0:14:55|He chuckled a few times to ease the awkwardness, and had to go along with the dance performance, while his apprentices below the stage were getting anxious.
0:15:1|0:15:9|The black girl in the audience responded.
0:15:9|0:15:14|The fake wife is teasing [Ma Shanglai] on stage, while [Ma Shanglai's Wife] watches everything from below.
0:15:14|0:15:15|The man in a suit responded promptly.
0:15:42|0:15:44|[Mao Xuewang] shows the business license to everyone.
0:15:50|0:15:52|[Ma Shanglai's Wife] stepped forward at this moment.
0:16:15|0:16:17|Ma Shanglai's Wife throws away the plaque.
0:16:23|0:16:24|A short scene.
0:17:6|0:17:13|[Mao Xuewang] was furious after watching the video, a charming and graceful woman left the scene with a smile, the camera then shifted to [Ma Shanglai]'s office.
0:18:1|0:18:5|The street director looked disdainfully at [Ma Shanglai], and the scene shifted to the doorway.
0:18:27|0:18:30|Mao Xuewang said angrily in the car.
0:18:30|0:18:40|In a luxurious villa, [Jiang Bian] dressed in a suit stood by the French window admiring the scenery. His son, sitting on the stairs, wiped away tears, hugged the aerial drone, and walked down. [Jiang Bian] looked melancholic.
0:18:42|0:18:50|[Jiang Bian] turned back in response, reaching out to his son.
0:18:50|0:18:51|[Ma Shanglai] and his group appear.
0:19:1|0:19:2|[Jiang Bian] always looks towards his son.
0:19:6|0:19:7|The nanny takes the son out of the living room.
0:19:35|0:19:36|Mao Xuewang suddenly appears.
0:20:23|0:20:25|Ma Shanglai's son said helplessly.
0:20:45|0:20:47|Outside the door, [Ma Shanglai] had no choice but to continue speaking.
0:20:51|0:20:52|The door suddenly bursts open.
0:20:57|0:20:59|The gates closed with a loud bang.
0:21:12|0:21:20|[Ma Shanglai] gradually became serious in tone, knowing that all his hard work had been completely ruined, he seemed to have lost his soul.
0:21:20|0:21:26|In the parking lot, [Jin Zhen] driving the car answered the phone with one hand.
0:21:38|0:21:43|A sudden screeching of brakes came from the other end of the phone.
0:21:44|0:21:47|The scene changes, and two apprentices arrive.
0:21:47|0:21:49|[Ma Shanglai] is dragging a suitcase.
0:22:20|0:22:26|With the persuasion of his apprentice, [Ma Shanglai] finally made up his mind to carefully pack his suitcase.
0:22:26|0:22:32|In the underground garage, the fat man lies on the ground, his eyes drifting towards the upper corner.
0:23:13|0:23:15|The fat man's smile quickly disappeared.
0:24:27|0:24:32|In the old Ma Shanglai's wife's home, his wife is meditating on a chair while their son is doing sit-ups on the floor.
0:24:32|0:24:39|The room was eerily quiet.
0:24:39|0:24:43|The son spoke up to break the silence, but the mother remained silent.
0:24:43|0:24:48|On the other side, Ma Shanglai, who finished chatting, opened the bedroom door and staggered towards the bathroom.
0:24:50|0:24:53|[Ma Shanglai] was startled and curled up in the corner.
0:25:5|0:25:8|Qingzhen walked out of the bathroom with a face mask on and wrapped in a towel.
0:25:22|0:25:26|The phone rings, and [Jin Zhen] answers the call.
0:25:32|0:25:36|Suddenly, she realized that [Ma Shanglai] was present and immediately ran into the bedroom.
0:25:58|0:26:2|[Mao Xuewang] looked at [Ma Shanglai], then turned to [Jin Zhen].
0:26:4|0:26:5|He burst into the room.
0:26:10|0:26:12|[Ma Shanglai's Wife] sat on the rattan chair, confidently speaking to her son.
0:26:39|0:26:43|[Ma Shanglai] looked at [Mao Xuewang], staring straight at [Jin Zhen], as [Mao Xuewang] advised.
0:26:59|0:27:0|Mao Xuewang doted on Ma Shanglai.
0:27:37|0:27:41|[Ma Shanglai] rides a bike at high speed.
0:27:41|0:27:47|[Mao Xuewang] opened the door, while [Ma Shanglai] carried a suitcase and walked in behind him, looking around the room.
0:28:20|0:28:28|The night was already late, with several night lights on in the room. [Ma Shanglai] lay on the leather sofa, trying to fall asleep but constantly being interrupted.
0:28:28|0:28:37|He opened his eyes and listened carefully, only to realize that it was the snoring sound of [Mao Xuewang], constantly coming from the room.
0:28:37|0:28:43|The penetrating voice made [Ma Shanglai] sit up, and he picked up the pillow next to him and threw it at [Mao Xuewang].
0:28:48|0:28:52|[Mao Xuewang] was knocked over, but still asleep.
0:28:52|0:28:54|Fortunately, the snoring stopped as a result.
0:28:54|0:28:58|[Ma Shanglai] immediately covered himself with a blanket, ready to go back to sleep.
0:28:58|0:29:7|But who knew that as soon as he closed his eyes, a louder snoring sound came, this time waking up [Mao Xuewang].
0:29:7|0:29:10|[Mao Xuewang] looked at [Ma Shanglai] and anxiously tapped his own forehead.
0:29:13|0:29:21|The snoring grew louder and louder, [Mao Xuewang] patted his startled heart and was about to lie down.
0:29:21|0:29:31|The sudden snoring once again startled Mao Xuewang, who got up from the bed and stared at Ma Shanglai, who was snoring loudly, with a very pained expression.
0:29:31|0:29:38|Finally, the continuous snoring broke through Mao Xuewang's defense line, and he couldn't help but gasp on the bed.
0:29:38|0:29:42|In the morning, [Ma Shanglai]'s son rushed to the toilet holding his stomach.
0:30:36|0:30:46|Jiang Bian handed the cue stick to [Ma Shanglai], who stepped forward to catch it, assuming a highly unorthodox stance and vigorously swinging with his left hand in a backhand motion.
0:30:48|0:30:52|The golf ball flew towards the hole and landed steadily inside.
0:30:52|0:30:56|[Ma Shanglai] jumped up happily when he saw it.
0:30:56|0:30:59|Mr. Jiang was surprised.
0:31:44|0:31:45|Mao Xuewang took out a photo of Little Green.
0:32:2|0:32:4|Xiaoli was getting a little anxious.
0:32:4|0:32:10|She quickly stirred the coffee cup, [Mao Xuewang] saw that communication was impossible, and then left.
0:32:25|0:32:28|[Ma Shanglai's Wife] scolds her son at home.
0:32:28|0:32:30|On the other side.
0:32:43|0:32:45|Gangzi joked.
0:32:45|0:32:47|Lulu is determined to take action after hearing this.
0:32:47|0:32:49|Lulu starts to drive people away.
0:33:5|0:33:11|[Jin Zhen] waved his hand to signal, and Gangzi also followed him as he left.
0:33:11|0:33:14|As soon as Gangzi left, [Jin Zhen] immediately waved and called for her friend [Lulu].
0:33:31|0:33:36|Outside the company, the secretary pushed the door open and walked towards [Ma Shanglai] and his two apprentices.
0:33:56|0:34:1|The secretary, after listening, looked persistently at [Ma Shanglai] and then turned and left.
0:34:4|0:34:9|On the other side, in [Mao Xuewang]'s luxurious room, fruits and vegetables were flying everywhere, creating a mess.
0:34:26|0:34:40|The couple from the bungalow unexpectedly arrived at [Mao Xuewang]'s house.
0:34:40|0:34:47|[Mao Xuewang] wanted to open the door, but was stopped by [Ma Shanglai].
0:34:47|0:34:51|[Mao Xuewang] opened the door, only to see Jia Ling shooting the vase in her hand straight out.
0:34:51|0:34:55|Mao Xuewang dodges and seizes the vase with his right hand.
0:34:56|0:35:4|He continued to bend down, grabbing the Tang Dynasty tri-color pottery with his left hand. Little did he know, a bigger sculpture was still to come.
0:35:4|0:35:8|Mao Xuewang jumped in fright, landing steadily with his legs clamped around the relic.
0:35:8|0:35:15|He looked at himself in disbelief, and [Ma Shanglai's Wife] also exclaimed.
0:35:19|0:35:25|As soon as the words fell, a bowl of cold noodles flew out, Mao Xuewang couldn't avoid it and was hit directly on the head by the noodles.
0:35:25|0:35:31|He glanced at [Ma Shanglai] with anger in his eyes, and [Ma Shanglai] looked a bit embarrassed, explaining.
0:35:34|0:35:41|[Ma Shanglai] finished speaking and walked into the room, with Mao Xuewang following closely behind him, staring at him as if he were a wooden puppet.
0:35:52|0:36:8|Jia Ling laughed after hearing it. Mao Xuewang was about to enter the door when the door suddenly opened, hitting Mao Xuewang outside. With no one around, [Ma Shanglai's Wife] waved her hand to urge the couple to leave quickly. At this moment, Jia Ling patted his shoulder and said, "Get married anytime, let's go."
0:36:14|0:36:18|[Ma Shanglai's Wife] was kicked out of the house by Mao Xuewang.
0:36:20|0:36:23|[Jin Zhen] arrived just in time.
0:36:46|0:36:54|Mao Xuewang pushed Ma Shanglai's Wife aside, pulled Ma Shanglai over, and then turned and left.
0:36:54|0:37:5|[Mao Xuewang] was furious. He gathered his strength and kicked [Ma Shanglai]'s luggage with his heel, then returned home to carefully clean up the aftermath.
0:37:5|0:37:7|Ma Shanglai's son walked in carrying a skateboard as soon as he looked up.
0:37:17|0:37:21|Ma Shanglai's son turned around.
0:37:21|0:37:29|In a plastic surgery hospital, [Ma Shanglai] followed [Jin Zhen] to Professor Guo's side, looking around nervously at everything.
0:37:29|0:37:34|Professor Guo spoke to [Jin Zhen].
0:37:34|0:37:38|[Jin Zhen] looked at [Ma Shanglai] and then [Ma Shanglai] turned and walked towards Professor Guo.
0:37:41|0:37:44|Professor Guo asked incredulously.
0:37:44|0:37:48|Ma Shanglai is sizing up the approaching figure.
0:38:0|0:38:7|[Ma Shanglai] looks serious and gazes at [Jin Zhen].
0:38:7|0:38:9|[Ma Shanglai] remained silent, while [Jin Zhen] laughed even more happily.
0:38:14|0:38:16|[Jin Zhen] is very shy.
0:38:16|0:38:20|Professor Guo waved his hand for [Ma Shanglai] to come closer.
0:38:20|0:38:26|[Ma Shanglai] leaned in close to Professor Guo, only to hear him whisper something quietly.
0:38:26|0:38:29|[Ma Shanglai] stared at the other person, but [Jin Zhen] became even more shy after hearing that.
0:38:41|0:38:50|[Jin Zhen] took out a photo, and the person in the photo, General Jiang, caught Professor Guo's attention.
0:38:50|0:38:57|Professor Guo looked at [Jin Zhen], in the room, [Jin Zhen] threw out a photo, it turned out to be Jiang Zong's appearance before plastic surgery.
0:39:5|0:39:9|Mr. Jiang sneered and slowly leaned back on the sofa after listening.
0:39:48|0:39:52|[Ma Shanglai] finished speaking and left with [Jin Zhen].
0:40:6|0:40:7|The younger brother left and returned.
0:40:11|0:40:29|Outside the parking lot, [Ma Shanglai] and his apprentices are waiting. When the target appears, [Ma Shanglai] starts his performance, and the female secretary walks past him.
0:41:0|0:41:2|The female secretary listened and forcefully closed the car door.
0:41:2|0:41:3|[Ma Shanglai] turned around and left the luxurious villa.
0:41:27|0:41:35|[Mao Xuewang] kept persuading Xiaoli, whose expression was somewhat sad. She picked up the divorce agreement on the table and made up her mind to sign her name on it.
0:41:39|0:41:43|The brush strokes slowly across the paper as Xiao Li throws the agreement away.
0:41:43|0:41:51|[Mao Xuewang] signaled with his eyes for his assistant to quickly put away the agreement, then a triumphant smile appeared on his face.
0:41:51|0:41:58|Xiaoli was about to leave gracefully when suddenly, a beautifully decorated family portrait in front of her caught her attention and made her slow down.
0:42:12|0:42:16|Xiaoli looked at her husband, disappointedly shaking her head at their son.
0:42:24|0:42:26|Xiao Li took a deep breath.
0:42:32|0:42:35|Middle-aged man appears, followed by [Ma Shanglai] and [Jin Zhen].
0:42:35|0:42:37|Ma Shanglai's Wife quickly got up.
0:42:38|0:42:39|Ma Shanglai's Wife is in a panic.
0:42:40|0:42:43|The father raised his hand and slapped.
0:42:43|0:42:45|Everyone was shocked.
0:43:3|0:43:5|Jin Zhen pulled the old man to sit down.
0:43:13|0:43:15|[Ma Shanglai] nodded repeatedly.
0:43:17|0:43:18|Everyone looked at the old man.
0:43:23|0:43:29|Everyone was shocked by the speech just now. The old man looked at his crying grandson and continued speaking.
0:43:43|0:43:48|The farce came to an end, and then [Ma Shanglai's Wife] took out a wad of money from the drawer.
0:43:48|0:43:57|Mao Xuewang greedily looked at the large sum of money in front of him, only to see Ma Shanglai throw a small bundle to him, and then he collected the money.
0:44:13|0:44:13|Mao Xuewang hesitated to speak.
0:44:13|0:44:14|The younger brother looked at Mao Xuewang.
0:44:14|0:44:15|On the other side, Ma Shanglai's Wife is video chatting.
0:44:15|0:44:16|The bald man looked surprised.
0:44:16|0:44:16|[Ma Shanglai] felt a little scared afterwards.
0:44:45|0:44:49|In Mao Xuewang's home, [Jin Zhen] is busy in the kitchen.
0:45:6|0:45:15|[Ma Shanglai] walked to the dining table, picked up [Jin Zhen]'s phone, chuckled lightly after seeing the incoming call information, and Mao Xuewang on the other end of the phone was furious in the car.
0:45:25|0:45:31|Mao Xuewang was startled by Ma Shanglai's voice, and then he picked up the phone and asked.
0:45:37|0:45:40|Mao Xuewang anxiously said.
0:45:40|0:45:44|After speaking, [Mao Xuewang] quickly rushed home.
0:45:44|0:45:52|He carried flowers and a cake, looking forward eagerly.
0:45:52|0:45:58|He put down the flowers and then looked towards the dining table.
0:46:8|0:46:10|Mao Xuewang is very distressed.
0:46:17|0:46:23|Seeing the extremely painful Mao Xuewang, Ma Shanglai realized the preciousness of the red wine and immediately poured out the remaining liquid.
0:46:23|0:46:24|Mao Xuewang rushes towards Ma Shanglai.
0:46:41|0:46:45|The expensive red wine shattered with a sound, while Ma Shanglai's Wife sat in a daze in the living room.
0:46:55|0:47:1|[Mao Xuewang] sent a photo of [Ma Shanglai] and [Jin Zhen] to [Ma Shanglai]'s son, and the scene shifted to [Ma Shanglai]'s home.
0:47:3|0:47:5|Ma Shanglai's son peeks out from the toilet.
0:47:7|0:47:14|He was taking a bath at this moment, and his mother picked up the phone and scrolled through it. Unexpectedly, his expression changed when he saw the content.
0:47:14|0:47:20|Mao Xuewang sent a photo of Ma Shanglai and Jin Zhen, in which they looked very sweet together.
0:47:20|0:47:23|In Mao Xuewang's office, Ma Shanglai's Wife stood silently with her hands crossed, seemingly lost in thought.
0:47:31|0:47:36|[Ma Shanglai]'s son placed the cup on the table, and the scene shifted to Mao Xuewang's house.
0:47:36|0:47:40|[Jin Zhen] is busy in the kitchen, [Ma Shanglai] walks past her from behind.
0:47:40|0:47:49|[Jin Zhen] turned around in fright, and he immediately explained.
0:47:49|0:47:56|[Ma Shanglai] turned his head, [Jin Zhen] smiled with a twinkle in his eye, and [Jin Zhen] placed the soup on the table, adding, "..."
0:48:6|0:48:19|[Jin Zhen] seemed lost in thought. He untied his apron and saw [Ma Shanglai] shaving his teeth in the mirror, so he immediately approached.
0:48:19|0:48:27|When the two were entangled, [Ma Shanglai's Wife] arrived with their son, interrupting their actions. [Ma Shanglai] said happily.
0:48:27|0:48:32|I came at the wrong time, Mao Xuewang is hiding behind the door, peeking.
0:48:34|0:48:36|[Ma Shanglai's Wife] walked slowly towards [Jin Zhen].
0:48:41|0:48:42|She then walked towards the liquor shelf.
0:48:48|0:48:50|[Mao Xuewang] covered his head in pain.
0:48:56|0:48:57|[Ma Shanglai's Wife] looks serious.
0:49:2|0:49:6|He suddenly lifted the tablecloth, then pushed down [Ma Shanglai], and walked away.
0:49:11|0:49:12|Before he could say much, he was slapped in the face.
0:49:13|0:49:23|[Ma Shanglai] stood up in a hurry. At this moment, [Ma Shanglai's Wife] stared at [Jin Zhen] as if she was about to devour him, but [Jin Zhen] simply picked up his bag and left.
0:49:23|0:49:27|[Ma Shanglai] chased a few steps and stopped beside [Ma Shanglai's Wife].
0:49:27|0:49:39|[Mao Xuewang] hurriedly chased out, leaving everyone in the house. [Ma Shanglai's Wife] looked rational, staring at the floor in silence for a long time. Then [Ma Shanglai] asked, and [Ma Shanglai's Wife] could not bear it anymore.
0:49:42|0:49:46|He turned around and pushed [Ma Shanglai] hard, then rushed out the door.
0:49:46|0:49:51|Ma Shanglai's son, sensing the danger, immediately chased after him. Suddenly, there was a flash of lightning and thunder outside, and heavy rain poured down.
0:50:7|0:50:18|At this moment, [Mao Xuewang] was nowhere to be found, shouting helplessly in the rain. [Ma Shanglai's Wife] also ran in the rain, tears mixing with raindrops, with [Ma Shanglai's Son] closely following with a bag in hand.
0:50:18|0:50:24|Soaked [Mao Xuewang] returned home and looked at [Ma Shanglai], who was passed out on the sofa, with great anger.
0:50:55|0:51:1|[Mao Xuewang] forgot he was driving on the road, the sound from the car radio interrupted his thoughts.
0:51:19|0:51:24|In the ruins, only one house remains un-demolished, with a struggling woman with a child at the doorstep.
0:51:52|0:52:1|With the demolition workers raising their hands to signal, an excavator lifted the shed up, with the contractor sitting inside. He waved to the women and smugly said.
0:52:6|0:52:7|The woman threw the bamboo pole in her hand at him.
0:52:10|0:52:14|The foreman was hit and fell from the scaffolding inside the silkworm shed.
0:52:14|0:52:17|In the car, [Mao Xuewang] hands over the contract.
0:52:27|0:52:31|Chai Qian's tone towards the boss changed, slowly took off his sunglasses and threatened.
0:52:33|0:52:38|[Mao Xuewang]’s face changed, and the scene shifted to the underground parking lot.
0:52:46|0:52:49|Skinny, speak up while lying on [Fatty].
0:52:58|0:52:59|The skinny man stood up with a smile.
0:53:13|0:53:17|At the command of the car owner, six strong men stepped out of the car.
0:53:17|0:53:21|The "Fat Guy" who had been lying on the ground all along saw the situation was not good, so he covered his face with his clothes.
0:53:21|0:53:22|The skinny man standing there said.
0:53:28|0:53:33|After speaking, the skinny guy started his performance and danced in front of everyone.
0:53:33|0:53:38|He said with a smile.
0:53:39|0:53:41|The strong men kicked the skinny man to the ground and fiercely hammered his brother.
0:53:46|0:53:56|The burly man grabbed [Fatty] and threw him onto the hood of the car. As he rolled to the ground, he crawled under the car, while the skinny man took the opportunity to climb into the car.
0:53:56|0:54:4|The back door of the car opens, the skinny guy is dragged out, and the [fat guy] crawling under the car is also blocked. He wanted to retreat, but was grabbed by two strong men.
0:54:4|0:54:9|Soon, the two of them were firmly trapped by the wheels of the car, enduring punches and kicks from the crowd.
0:54:9|0:54:12|In a critical moment, [Ma Shanglai] arrives on a motorcycle just in time.
0:54:13|0:54:18|The burly man was beating everyone up, sizing up [Ma Shanglai], who faced the crowd without any fear.
0:54:26|0:54:46|The car owner pointed at [Ma Shanglai], and the strong man behind him immediately rushed over, throwing punches. [Ma Shanglai] remained calm, dodging each one. Seeing this, the scamming brothers grabbed weapons at hand, but [Ma Shanglai] swung his bag and knocked the strong man down. The scamming brothers were stunned, then [Ma Shanglai] threw the bag and stepped back.
0:54:47|0:54:56|Striking the enemy's vital point behind him with ease, as the leg sweep comes, [Ma Shanglai] bends down to dodge, then uses the enemy's back to perform a backflip, followed by a kick to the enemy's vital point.
0:55:18|0:55:20|The crowd scattered and fled.
0:55:20|0:55:26|Previously arrogant, [Ma Shanglai] no longer had that demeanor. At this moment, he turned his head to look at the scamming brothers hiding in the corner.
0:55:44|0:55:56|[Ma Shanglai] helplessly turned his head and then said to them.
0:55:56|0:56:0|The fat man turned his head to look at the skinny man, as if seeking his opinion.
0:56:0|0:56:4|The two of them smiled and bowed to each other.
0:56:4|0:56:14|[Ma Shanglai] deciphered the hidden meaning in the words. The next day, at the entrance of the residential area, the fat guy in a security guard uniform was munching on a cucumber, while the skinny guy stood aside playing with his phone.
0:56:14|0:56:21|The fat man glanced disdainfully at the other person, and then noticed a homeowner entering the room. He immediately stood up and raised his hand to stop the car.
0:56:21|0:56:27|The skinny guy also stepped forward and gave a standard salute when he saw [Ma Shanglai], and the car window rolled down slowly.
0:56:27|0:56:34|[Mao Xuewang] poked his head out, and the two brothers also recognized [Mao Xuewang].
0:56:47|0:56:49|The three of them chatted happily.
0:56:53|0:56:55|The fat man looks down on it.
0:57:20|0:57:22|[Ma Shanglai] instructs his apprentices.
0:57:22|0:57:32|With a glance, [Mao Xuewang] came into view, followed by a skinny guy and a fat guy. Seeing his persuading target turning into an opponent, [Ma Shanglai] sneered.
0:57:32|0:57:38|[Mao Xuewang] also noticed the other party. He took off his sunglasses and watched as [Ma Shanglai] and his two apprentices walked towards him.
0:57:53|0:57:56|[Mao Xuewang] looked puzzled, and [Ma Shanglai] realized he had spoken inadvertently.
0:57:58|0:57:59|He said to [Jin Zhen].
0:57:59|0:58:1|He then turned around and walked away.
0:58:1|0:58:3|Lulu also clenched her fists to warn Mao Xuewang.
0:58:3|0:58:7|In Sun Erxiang's home, Mao Xuewang said.
0:58:24|0:58:25|Sun Erxiang's face changed.
0:58:32|0:58:34|Fat Yu stabilized his center of gravity.
0:58:36|0:58:37|[Ma Shanglai] replied.
0:58:40|0:58:42|The setting sun, in front of [Ma Shanglai's Wife]'s house.
0:58:54|0:58:59|The door opens, and [Ma Shanglai's Wife] is taken aback to see that it's [Jin Zhen] who has come knocking.
0:59:14|0:59:17|[Jin Zhen] finished speaking and walked away without giving any chance.
0:59:17|0:59:19|Ma Shanglai's Wife scolded with her head down.
0:59:33|0:59:34|Mao Xuewang goes home.
0:59:36|0:59:40|The old [Ma Shanglai's Son] came to inform [Ma Shanglai], then turned and left.
0:59:42|0:59:44|[Ma Shanglai] quickly added.
0:59:55|0:59:56|Sun Erxiang's home.
0:59:56|1:0:0|Can't stay at home anymore, [Mao Xuewang] is still trying to persuade.
1:0:4|1:0:9|[Sun Erxiang] ruthlessly threw the bank card on the table, and [Mao Xuewang] stood up slowly.
1:0:9|1:0:13|He threatened.
1:0:20|1:0:22|[Mao Xuewang] finished speaking and left without looking back.
1:0:22|1:0:26|Outside the house, [Ma Shanglai] is picking up steel bars and happens to overhear [Mao Xuewang] chatting.
1:0:28|1:0:38|[Mao Xuewang] looked around and gestured for his younger brother to lower his head.
1:0:38|1:0:42|[Ma Shanglai] nearby eavesdropping.
1:0:42|1:0:49|[Mao Xuewang] left after giving instructions, the fat guy and the skinny guy stood still as if they didn't understand, looking at each other in confusion.
1:0:49|1:0:52|On the bridge over the river, [Ma Shanglai] is riding a motorcycle at high speed.
1:1:9|1:1:16|[Ma Shanglai], who received the message, rushed all the way. As the sky darkened, he suddenly remembered his promise to his wife, so he dialed the phone.
1:1:16|1:1:24|On the other end of the phone, in the quiet private room filled with guests, [Ma Shanglai's Wife] looked at her phone in silence, everyone was waiting for [Ma Shanglai].
1:1:24|1:1:30|But Ma Shanglai's Wife did not answer the phone, her chest heaving, huge emotions brewing.
1:1:30|1:1:33|In Sun Erxiang's home, Ma Shanglai stands on the balcony with his apprentice.
1:1:38|1:1:50|The scene shifts, two puppet bears appear, they flip through the window and enter, while the third puppet keeps watch outside.
1:1:56|1:2:0|The headgear is removed, revealing that it is [Ma Shanglai's Wife] and [Ma Shanglai's Apprentice].
1:2:2|1:2:7|[Mao Xuewang] did not give any orders, so they put on their hoods and headed upstairs.
1:2:7|1:2:14|The firecrackers tied around his waist were already prepared, and they laid them on the stairs. At this moment, [Ma Shanglai] also slowly arrived.
1:2:14|1:2:19|[Skinny] took out a lighter, just lit the firecracker, and a long-haired female ghost rushed out from the second floor door.
1:2:19|1:2:23|[Ma Shanglai's Wife] and [Ma Shanglai's Apprentice] were startled and tumbled down the stairs.
1:2:23|1:2:27|Mao Xuewang behind him saw the situation was not good and immediately slipped away.
1:2:27|1:2:34|When they just rushed to the gate, the grim reaper-like ghost suddenly appeared, causing [Ma Shanglai's Wife] and [Ma Shanglai's Apprentice] to have to turn back.
1:2:34|1:2:41|On the other side, a ghostly figure resembling Bai Wuchang appeared behind [Mao Xuewang], spitting fire from his mouth like a demon reaping souls in hell.
1:2:41|1:2:44|Mao Xuewang was caught on the second floor and collided with the little brothers.
1:2:46|1:2:56|They had no time to react before a huge log came flying through the air, knocking [Mao Xuewang] and two others, who fell into the water pit outside.
1:2:56|1:3:1|The successful [Ma Shanglai] and his group rushed over, mocking the drenched [Mao Xuewang] on the balcony.
1:3:2|1:3:6|[Mao Xuewang] quickly got up and led his apprentices to escape the disaster.
1:3:6|1:3:12|The farce came to a temporary end, and [Ma Shanglai] and his group moved to the edge of the balcony, remaining on guard.
1:3:12|1:3:18|Indoors, [Sun Erxiang] was attracted and opened the window to observe, which startled him.
1:3:18|1:3:25|[Ma Shanglai] and his group immediately took off their masks, the failed fat and thin duo peeked out, looking into the distance.
1:3:34|1:3:40|The huge launcher fell to the ground with a loud noise, and after the skinny guy adjusted the angle, he lit the fuse.
1:3:40|1:3:52|[Ma Shanglai]'s apprentice was completely unaware, playing a game, when the pear blossoms poured out, instantly lighting up the sky. Lulu and Gangzi were unable to react in time, like startled little rabbits.
1:3:52|1:4:1|Sun Erxiang was awakened by the sound of an explosion, opened the door and looked outside. The fireworks were still going on, and the lonely house became the only target. Ma Shanglai arrived just in time.
1:4:19|1:4:22|The cannonball was shot with precision.
1:4:22|1:4:24|Feng Xiong brother was hit, leaving only a miserable scream.
1:4:37|1:4:38|Back to reality.
1:4:51|1:4:57|[Jin Zhen] rushed over and handed [Ma Shanglai] a vintage-looking pen.
1:4:57|1:5:3|[Ma Shanglai] stared at the pen, the gate of memory quietly opened, and he finally recognized the [Jin Zhen] in front of him.
1:5:17|1:5:20|Seriously injured, the driver fled.
1:5:34|1:5:38|In the memory, [Ma Shanglai] handed a pen to [Jin Zhen].
1:5:38|1:5:46|The slow-motion flashback comes to an end, [Ma Shanglai] stares at the pen from years ago, then suddenly looks at [Jin Zhen].
1:5:46|1:5:52|[Jin Zhen] remained silent, looking tenderly at [Ma Shanglai], the once helpless little girl who had now grown up.
1:5:59|1:6:14|At night, outside Sun Erxiang's house, Ma Shanglai sits alone on the balcony. He picks up the phone beside him and gently presses a button. On the screen is a family photo of three. Feeling lonely in the house, he regrets not fulfilling the promise he made to his wife.
1:6:14|1:6:23|On the other side, the old [Ma Shanglai's Wife] was also quietly looking out of the window on the balcony at home. On the screen of her phone, there was also a family photo of three people.
1:6:23|1:6:26|After looking at the group photo for a while, he put away his phone and took a deep breath.
1:6:46|1:6:53|Mao Xuewang waved goodbye, the younger brothers turned and left, and collided head-on with the middle-aged man coming towards them.
1:6:53|1:7:2|After watching his younger brother leave, the middle-aged man walked forward and knocked on the office door, looking at [Mao Xuewang] inside.
1:7:47|1:7:51|Sun Erxiang in the palace silently watched Ma Shanglai.
1:8:35|1:8:36|Sun Erxiang opens up her heart.
1:8:38|1:8:40|[Ma Shanglai] remained silent.
1:8:50|1:8:53|Ma Shanglai was listening and thinking at this hotpot restaurant.
1:9:1|1:9:11|At this moment, [Ma Shanglai] became the only listener, sitting on the steps fanning himself.
1:9:13|1:9:16|[Sun Erxiang] eased the tension and continued speaking.
1:9:20|1:9:30|She opens her heart and voluntarily shares the stories buried deep inside, appearing tough on the surface like a nail householder, yet with a gentle side behind her.
1:9:33|1:9:35|Facing her deceased husband.
1:9:41|1:9:51|Sun Erxiang's choice is to protect the shared dream of the husband and wife, to keep the hotpot restaurant intact, and not be infringed upon by anyone.
1:9:51|1:9:58|[Ma Shanglai] turned his head to look.
1:9:58|1:10:0|Sun Erxiang was amazed at the sight of the orange tree.
1:10:9|1:10:14|Sun Erxiang's stubbornness and persistence turned into tears silently streaming down her face.
1:10:21|1:10:26|The next morning, Sun Erxiang strolled through the ruins, the exhaustion of the night had already worn down Ma Shanglai.
1:10:26|1:10:30|He used to sleep, and the footsteps did not disturb him at all.
1:10:30|1:10:33|Sun Erxiang slowly squatted down upon seeing this.
1:10:33|1:10:38|He invited [Ma Shanglai] to his home and poured him a glass of wine.
1:10:51|1:10:58|[Ma Shanglai] was a little stunned after hearing this, not expecting the other party to make a decision so quickly.
1:11:7|1:11:15|[Sun Erxiang] faced [Ma Shanglai], raising her cup with both hands. After a moment of hesitation, [Ma Shanglai] clinked glasses with her, and it seemed like their promises were hidden in that cup of wine.
1:11:27|1:11:34|Soon, [Sun Erxiang] began to move out, holding her husband [Li Yixiang] in her arms, slowly leaving under the gaze of the demolition workers.
1:11:34|1:11:43|[Ma Shanglai] and his group followed like bodyguards, while his apprentice [Lulu] helped hold [Sun Erxiang]'s child. Gangzi was holding the signboard of the hotpot restaurant.
1:11:43|1:11:49|As soon as the group left, the demolition team quickly started working, taking away the orange tree that [Sun Erxiang] cherished the most.
1:11:49|1:11:59|[Ma Shanglai] quickly stopped and with his apprentices moved the orange tree to a safe place. Meanwhile, [Mao Xuewang]'s son was demanding his own compensation from the boss during the demolition.
1:12:16|1:12:19|[Mao Xuewang] angrily left and turned to the office.
1:12:38|1:12:40|For the sake of his child, Ma Shanglai arrived at the bank.
1:12:46|1:12:49|[Guoyuan] borrowed a bank card and started to handle the transaction.
1:12:49|1:12:56|In a cybercafe, the internet-addicted son is battling in front of the computer. Suddenly feeling very uncomfortable, he stops the game and starts rubbing his forehead.
1:12:56|1:13:4|Suddenly, he slammed his head straight into the keyboard and passed out, his female companion beside him noticing something was wrong.
1:13:4|1:13:7|He helped the man up, whose face was very pale.
1:14:5|1:14:9|The fat and thin brothers heard the sound and ran out of the toilet, with their pants still hanging in mid-air.
1:14:42|1:14:45|The phone rings, and [Ma Shanglai's Wife] answers the call.
1:14:45|1:14:52|[Mao Xuewang] drove the oil tanker out of the small road, crashed through the roadblock onto the main road, while on the other side, [Ma Shanglai] was nervously pacing.
1:14:52|1:14:54|The oil tanker raced all the way towards the city.
1:15:5|1:15:16|[Ma Shanglai] drives a motorcycle to chase after [Mao Xuewang], while inside the car, [Mao Xuewang] observes the traffic. The middle-aged man crawls towards the window and fiercely folds it, causing the glass in the driver's cabin to shatter.
1:15:16|1:15:23|The two are fighting together, while on the other side, racing to the hospital, [Jin Zhen] is still unconscious and in danger at any time.
1:15:25|1:15:32|The struggle inside the oil tanker continues, with the middle-aged man gaining the upper hand and grabbing the steering wheel.
1:15:32|1:15:37|On the road, [Ma Shanglai] is riding a motorcycle, speeding towards the back of the oil tanker.
1:15:37|1:15:41|Mao Xuewang in the co-pilot seat tries to grab the steering wheel, while Ma Shanglai is overpowered by the middle-aged man.
1:15:44|1:15:56|The speed of the oil tanker did not decrease, and the motorcycle tried every way to keep up with it. Suddenly, the motorcycle's engine speed soared, quickly coming to the right side of the oil tanker. Mao Xuewang on the passenger seat seemed to see a savior, tapping on the window for help.
1:16:4|1:16:16|After Zhongyan finished speaking, he sharply turned the steering wheel to the right, with the motorcycle squeezed behind. [Ma Shanglai] maintained the speed, keeping pace with the oil tanker. Then, he stood up on the motorcycle, leaped forward, and landed at the rear of the oil tanker.
1:16:16|1:16:25|Zhongyan looked into the rearview mirror and realized the camera was off. Then he accidentally stepped on the accelerator, causing [Ma Shanglai] on the roof to lose balance and be thrown out, narrowly escaping a disaster.
1:16:26|1:16:39|He hooked his hand onto the roof rail to stabilize himself, intending to pull himself up. However, the blood, the oil tanker was too slippery to find a foothold. As the speed of the car gradually increased, he found himself in danger. After several attempts, he finally made it back to the roof of the car.
1:16:41|1:16:44|Looking up at the TV news broadcast.
1:16:58|1:17:8|The scene returns to the oil tanker, with [Ma Shanglai] back on the roof walking towards the front connection. He takes off his helmet and joyfully leaps into the driver's cabin, firmly grabbing the door frame with both hands.
1:17:17|1:17:28|Echoes came from behind, [Ma Shanglai] turned his head and saw that the police had arrived.
1:17:44|1:17:49|On the right side of the carriage is a large electronic screen.
1:17:49|1:17:58|The promotional vehicle is broadcasting a surgery, with a middle-aged man's son lying on the operating table.
1:17:58|1:18:7|The middle-aged man stepped on the brake, but the speed did not decrease at all.
1:18:7|1:18:8|[Ma Shanglai] flips into the driver's seat.
1:18:14|1:18:23|Mao Xuewang seizes the opportunity to move forward and helps the middle-aged man to safety.
1:18:23|1:18:30|Mao [Ma] had no choice but to continue driving the car forward as there were no other people on the road, luckily it was an unfinished bridge.
1:18:53|1:18:56|Everyone ran towards the falling location.
1:18:56|1:19:6|[Ma Shanglai] is in a critical condition, but Mao Xuewang is stopped by the police when trying to take a closer look.
1:19:6|1:19:16|[Jin Zhen] hurried over, looking at the oil tanker sinking gradually in the river, with an excited expression.
1:19:20|1:19:31|Junzhen could not believe everything in front of her. The support in her heart seemed to collapse at this moment, and the river surface returned to calmness. The fall of the oil tanker only caused a brief ripple.
1:19:31|1:19:41|Mao [Xuewang] hung his head in frustration, while the middle-aged man was in tears, filled with regret in his eyes.
1:19:41|1:19:43|Suddenly, a figure emerged from the water tank by the bridge.
1:19:45|1:19:49|[Ma Shanglai] poked his head out, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief.
1:19:49|1:19:52|The reporter quickly stepped forward and handed the microphone to [Ma Shanglai], asking a question.
1:19:55|1:19:56|[Ma Shanglai] moved with difficulty.
1:20:1|1:20:4|Ma Shanglai's Wife pushes Mao Xuewang away.
1:20:4|1:20:8|Lulu hugged Steel by her side, while Ma Shanglai's Wife stayed close to the TV.
1:20:13|1:20:17|The stone hanging in his heart slowly fell as Ma Shanglai was rescued.
1:20:17|1:20:25|Night falls, the rescued [Ma Shanglai] walks alone on the street, while two skateboarders quietly appear behind him.
1:20:25|1:20:27|They passed by [Ma Shanglai] and snatched his bag away.
1:20:39|1:20:46|[Ma Shanglai] swung his arms, years of running around to mediate between parties had invisibly strengthened his body.
1:20:46|1:20:59|At this moment, he got his reward, the lights on the road were bright, and soon he arrived at a downhill slope, about to catch up with [Ma Shanglai]. However, at this moment, the gap between them widened, using the slope as a skateboard boost, they slid quickly towards the bottom of the slope.
1:20:59|1:21:7|[Ma Shanglai] continued to pursue, the skateboarder glided past the restaurant on the street, showing off by lifting his crotch bag, catching [Ma Shanglai]'s attention.
1:21:8|1:21:12|They then took the escalator and arrived at an open space.
1:21:12|1:21:18|[Ma Shanglai] is no longer a young man, his physical strength has reached its limit, and the skateboard boy is gradually left behind.
1:21:18|1:21:23|He came to the square helplessly, only to unexpectedly find [Ma Shanglai's Wife] standing under the Guanyin Bridge.
1:21:23|1:21:26|The drone carrying the crossbow slowly flew towards [Ma Shanglai's Wife].
1:21:26|1:21:32|Suddenly, a beam of light shone on the face of [Ma Shanglai's Wife], time had settled [Ma Shanglai's Wife]'s temperament.
1:21:32|1:21:36|At this moment, she was like a ripe fruit, exuding a charming fragrance, leaving [Ma Shanglai] stunned.
1:21:38|1:21:41|Ma Shanglai, seeing no response, turned his head in frustration and prepared to leave.
1:21:41|1:21:44|At this moment, the big screen above suddenly lit up.
1:23:3|1:23:12|[Ma Shanglai] finally revealed the words hidden in his heart under the influence of alcohol, and at this moment, his wife, who had been misunderstanding him all along, finally understood his true feelings.

1:23:19|1:23:22|On the big screen, the figure of [Mao Xuewang] suddenly appears.
