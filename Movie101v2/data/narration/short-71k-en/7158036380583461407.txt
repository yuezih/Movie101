0:2:21|0:2:40|[Du Ziteng] drove a pickup truck, listening to the radio as he passed through the streets and alleys, arriving at a bungalow. After getting out of the car with gifts in hand, he looked at himself in the rearview mirror, tidied his hair with one hand, squeezed out a smile, and cautiously opened the iron gate after looking around.
0:2:53|0:3:5|[Du Ziteng] was startled by the sudden appearance of a big dog, and slowly got up to walk over.
0:3:5|0:3:11|[Du Ziteng] heard the sound, turned his head and waved his hand.
0:3:20|0:3:28|[Lao Song] turned around, lifted the door curtain, and walked into the house, leaving [Du Ziteng] standing in the courtyard with a gift box in hand. The first shot appeared, showing the Old Du Restaurant.
0:4:28|0:4:41|Du Ziteng stumbled and hit the wall, then turned around to see a glamorous woman standing by the door, her arm slowly retracting in mid-air.
0:4:41|0:4:49|Lost in memories, she was carrying a hemp sack when she passed by the entrance of the restaurant hall, and heard a series of rapid breaths.
0:4:49|0:4:55|She took a few steps back, lifted the door curtain, and saw a glamorous woman being held in the arms of a man.
0:4:55|0:5:1|One careless move, the balloon in [Du Ziteng]'s hand slipped and flew away, and she suddenly snapped back to reality.
0:6:2|0:6:18|Fan Huahua got into the car but couldn't start it, and was mocked by [Du Ziteng].
0:6:26|0:6:35|[Du Ziteng] held a brick he had just picked up at the door, pointing forward as Fan Huahua drove away from Lao Du's restaurant in flames.
0:6:35|0:6:49|[Du Ziteng] was about to walk back, but stopped and looked towards the stage. The actor immediately started singing, and he waved the fly swatter, dancing along with the music on stage. Seeing this, the Nanfu staff who was watching the excitement at the door returned to the shop.
0:6:49|0:6:52|A large truck drove past the street outside the restaurant.
0:6:53|0:7:0|Fan Huahua, driving and talking on the phone, completely failed to notice the van coming from the opposite direction.
0:7:0|0:7:6|Raising her head, she was so scared that she quickly turned the steering wheel, stepped on the brake, and the car stopped by the roadside.
0:7:6|0:7:21|The scene shifts to a large courtyard in Shanxi, where a dozen men in black clothes form a square. One man is kneeling in the center, while another man sitting on a chair in front of him takes off his sunglasses, hands them to the bodyguard behind him, and picks up the teacup on the table to take a sip.
0:7:34|0:7:43|Hung up the phone on [Fan Huahua], Qin Shousheng punched the man kneeling on the ground and knocked him down, then returned to Old Du's restaurant.
0:7:43|0:7:45|Police officer [Chun Ge] walked into the store and asked.
0:8:16|0:8:23|[Du Ziteng], looking towards the hall, [Chun Ge] turned his head.
0:8:23|0:8:26|[Chun Ge] turned around and walked towards the hall.
0:8:26|0:8:30|He pushed aside the door curtain and glanced at the guests inside who were having their meal.
0:8:30|0:8:34|At this moment, Qin Shousheng arrived at Fan Huahua's place, got out of the car and asked.
0:8:57|0:9:2|Qin Shousheng stopped by the car and pointed to Fan Huahua's car, saying to the bodyguard.
0:9:2|0:9:5|Before long, he drove to the restaurant of [Du Ziteng].
0:9:5|0:9:10|The scene cuts to the store, where a suitcase full of money is placed on the table.
0:9:10|0:9:13|[Qin Shousheng] took a deep breath with a tower in his hand, then put it down and closed the file.
0:10:6|0:10:9|He took out the divorce agreement.
0:10:9|0:10:13|[Du Ziteng] extended his arm and made a pinky promise.
0:10:13|0:10:19|[Qin Shousheng] looked at [Du Ziteng] retracting his hand.
0:10:19|0:10:21|[Du Ziteng] looked at him without saying a word.
0:10:33|0:10:41|[Qin Shousheng] provocatively popped a balloon.
0:10:41|0:10:42|He quickly pulled up [Fan Huahua].
0:10:47|0:10:55|Leaving [Du Ziteng] alone in the shop, he looks at the suitcase full of money on the table, recalling the scene of the two being forced together.
0:10:55|0:11:6|Notice that [Fan Huahua] quickly straightened his clothes, pushed [Yin Cha] away, and [Yin Cha] then turned his head in the direction of [Fan Huahua]'s gaze.
0:11:6|0:11:10|[Du Ziteng] stood still, his body trembling slightly, blinking his eyes.
0:11:11|0:11:19|That night, he pushed open a big door, carrying a suitcase in his hand, and looked around the courtyard as he walked.
0:11:19|0:11:27|Under the eaves of the Shanxi courtyard hung lanterns. [Du Ziteng] walked to the middle of the courtyard, set down the suitcase, and crossed his hands behind his back.
0:12:33|0:12:40|[Du Ziteng] kicked the suitcase that had just been picked up and put down, straightened the hem of his clothes, turned around and walked out.
0:12:40|0:12:47|Driving the car, [Du Ziteng] passed by a park where aunts were waving fans and dancing square dance.
0:12:47|0:12:51|She slowly stopped the car, looked around, and suddenly started waving her hands.
0:13:3|0:13:22|After a silent burst of laughter, [Du Ziteng] started the car, passing by a shopping center. His phone rang, so he pulled over to answer the call.
0:13:22|0:13:28|[Du Ziteng] drove back to the restaurant, and the light next to the sign was broken, turning it into an old-fashioned restaurant.
0:13:30|0:13:39|Song Yujiao, wearing a down jacket and high heels, got out of the car together with Du Ziteng, who opened the door.
0:13:39|0:13:44|[Song Yujiao] followed behind her and walked in after lifting the door curtain.
0:13:44|0:13:53|The crowd looked around in the shop, and suddenly the lights came on. The hall was surrounded by round tables with light bulbs, and there were fruits and cakes on top.
0:13:53|0:13:57|[Song Yujiao] was surprised to see her own poster hanging on the wall in front of her.
0:14:1|0:14:6|Du Ziteng picked up a heart-shaped balloon from the ground and smiled slightly.
0:14:6|0:14:14|[Du Ziteng] walked out from the kitchen at this moment, holding two glasses of red wine in his hands and a bottle of red wine tucked under his arm. He played a song on his phone.
0:14:14|0:14:19|Yujiao turned around at the sound, leaning against the door frame was [Du Ziteng].
0:14:19|0:14:24|Yujiao looked at Du Ziteng with a face full of affection and smiled happily. Du Ziteng walked to the table.
0:14:37|0:14:51|Watching [Song Yujiao] slam her hands on the table, [Du Ziteng] went to get white wine and two bowls, poured some into one and handed it to [Song Yujiao].
0:14:51|0:14:53|Once seated, [Song Yujiao] immediately started clinking glasses with others.
0:14:55|0:15:0|[Song Yujiao] smiled gently as she picked up her bowl.
0:15:10|0:15:14|[Du Ziteng] picked up the overturned red wine glass and poured in the wine.
0:15:14|0:15:17|[Song Yujiao] rested her chin on one hand and raised a glass of wine with the other.
0:16:1|0:16:12|Standing aside, [Du Ziteng] pursed his lips, then suddenly knelt down, holding a ring in his hand. [Song Yujiao] was stunned.
0:17:29|0:17:43|He took out the divorce agreement and spread it out on the table.
0:17:43|0:17:46|Excited, the ring fell to the ground.
0:17:46|0:17:51|[Du Ziteng] hurriedly bent down to pick it up, but Yu Jia was amused, and [Du Ziteng] laughed along.
0:18:2|0:18:9|The two stood up and laughed, but as Song Yujiao turned around, she jumped up and hugged Du Ziteng, their eyes met, and they couldn't control their feelings.
0:18:37|0:18:45|[Du Ziteng] walked out of the inner hall, while putting on the vest that had just been half-pulled off by [Song Yujiao], zipping it all the way up to his chin.
0:18:45|0:18:56|He pushed aside the door curtain and walked into the hall, with [Song Yujiao] following him out of the inner hall, one hand on the door frame looking around, and then slowly walked out.
0:18:56|0:19:0|[Du Ziteng] unlocked the door, looked outside, and then walked out.
0:19:4|0:19:12|On a cold night, the wind made him shiver. Just as he was about to turn back, he noticed a large package on the ground.
0:19:12|0:19:22|[Du Ziteng] walked forward, bent down to take a look, glanced around to make sure no one was nearby, then immediately squatted down and unzipped the bag.
0:19:22|0:19:25|Just as Du Ziteng identified it as a pottery jar, a gunshot suddenly rang out.
0:19:28|0:19:33|[Du Ziteng] was so scared that he sat down on the ground and quickly stumbled into the house.
0:19:33|0:19:39|A truck drives by on the highway, [Du Ziteng] crouches down and reaches for the door frame.
0:19:44|0:19:52|He carefully moved to the glass window next to the signature dish, stooped down slightly and pushed open the gauze window a little, observing the activity outside.
0:19:52|0:20:0|[Song Yujiao] squatted and ran behind him. The screen quickly turned black and moved to the second chapter, "Knife-Cut Noodles".
0:20:0|0:20:8|In a noodle shop, as the perspective carrying two bowls of noodles moves, [Fan Huahua] is sitting across from [Leng Housheng], with [Leng Housheng] picking up a chopstick of noodles.
0:20:24|0:20:27|[Leng Housheng] takes off his sunglasses.
0:20:56|0:21:1|The scene shifts to an underground basement, where nine tables are set up and people are playing mahjong at the table in the middle.
0:21:16|0:21:23|Please have [Qin Shousheng] walk up in a suit.
0:21:23|0:21:29|Next, [Song Siyuan] signed the IOU, then locked eyes with [Qin Shousheng] and the short bald man behind him.
0:21:35|0:21:44|The man across the table pushed down the mahjong tiles, and [Song Yujiao] casually picked up one, touched it, and smiled.
0:21:44|0:21:52|The person opposite touched the Nine of Characters, which beat [Song Gongzi]'s Six of Characters.
0:21:52|0:21:56|The scene cuts to the office, where [Song Yujiao] is drinking tea and pursing his lips.
0:22:8|0:22:11|Celebrates taking over the IOU from [Leng Housheng].
0:22:35|0:22:39|Leng Housheng walked over expressionlessly, lifted Song Siyuan up, and pressed him onto the table.
0:23:5|0:23:26|The two walked out, with [Leng Housheng] remembering to take the IOU, and the scene shifted to the [Song family].
0:23:26|0:23:36|[Lao Song] leaned on his cane with both hands, silent. He caught [Song Siyuan]'s gaze, turned his head slightly, and signaled to [Leng Housheng] to open the folder and step forward.
0:23:36|0:23:39|The two looked at each other, and [Qin Shousheng] put on his sunglasses.
0:24:6|0:24:9|[Qin Shousheng] stood up, opened his mouth stiffly, and then sat back down.
0:24:28|0:24:34|In the house, [Fan Huahua] who is playing on her phone comes out to help her father, [Qin Shousheng], who stops her and turns back.
0:24:45|0:24:52|[Qin Shousheng] walked out while giving [Leng Housheng] a kick, and [Fan Huahua] spoke up.
0:24:52|0:24:54|[Song Siyuan] stepped forward, pointing with his index finger.
0:25:18|0:25:30|[Fan Huahua] pushed [Lao Song] down again.
0:25:30|0:25:38|[Lao Song] picked up the teacup on the table and threw it to the ground, then spoke while leaning on his cane.
0:25:38|0:25:43|[Song Siyuan] turned and left, then walked into a restaurant where two beautiful women were sitting beside him.
0:25:58|0:26:5|[Qin Shousheng] across the way raised his hand and gave [Leng Housheng] a hit on the head.
0:26:14|0:26:18|Leng Housheng holds down both sides of Leng Housheng and Yin Cha.
0:27:10|0:27:22|The scene shifts to a dilapidated courtyard with a group of men forming a circle. In the center, three workers have already dug a deep pit and are continuing to dig with shovels.
0:27:22|0:27:39|Two workers with hoes stood at the edge of the pit, while [Song Siyuan], leaning forward, looked into the pit with his hands in his pockets, rolling a clod of dirt under his feet. He glanced at the people on both sides, took a few steps, then turned back and said.
0:27:41|0:27:48|He climbed up two steps.
0:28:20|0:28:21|He took the jar still covered in soil.
0:28:39|0:28:43|Soon, Du Ziteng looked at the jar.
0:28:43|0:28:46|The expert put down the jar and said.
0:29:41|0:29:45|The expert turned around, and [Qin Shousheng] handed over the file bag.
0:29:49|0:29:50|After the eye expert left.
0:30:10|0:30:18|[Qin Shousheng] quickly grabbed a piece of cloth to wrap up the jar that had just almost fallen and scared everyone.
0:30:18|0:30:20|Leng Housheng pointed blankly towards the door.
0:30:25|0:30:29|The two of them changed to a wrapped cloth bag, and [Qin Shousheng] stuffed the jar into the cabinet.
0:31:20|0:31:23|[Yellow Hair], a famous killer from Hong Kong.
0:31:36|0:31:43|The scene shifts to a sharp and decisive action by a killer, with the sound of beasts roaring.
0:31:43|0:31:57|On a street, after a pair of feet appear and stand firm, a motorcycle is approaching in the direction they are facing. [Yellow Hair], with a backpack on his back and wearing a jacket, extends his arms towards the motorcycle.
0:31:57|0:32:6|The motorcycle slowed down and stopped, his eyes squinted slightly behind the sunglasses. The two locked eyes, and he walked towards the motorcycle owner.
0:32:6|0:32:14|On the other side, a police car is parked on a stone bridge. An officer walks to the edge of the bridge, raises a camera, and prepares to take a photo.
0:32:14|0:32:25|Under the bridge, several police officers were busy. One officer taking photos found a pair of glasses, put them in a bag, and handed them to the captain.
0:32:25|0:32:27|The captain took a look and handed it to the person next to him.
0:32:29|0:32:38|At this moment, two masked men tiptoed into Qin Shousheng's room, one of them holding a large suitcase and looking towards the door.
0:32:38|0:32:44|The two crouched down, opened the cabinet where the jars were stored, and took out a jar to fill the plum bag.
0:32:44|0:32:47|The screen goes black, a short-haired woman looking into the mirror.
0:33:51|0:33:55|The scene returns to the courtyard of [Song Yujiao]'s home, where [Fan Huahua] is on the phone.
0:34:42|0:34:46|This is [Qin Shousheng] carrying a briefcase with 500,000 for old [Du Ziteng].
0:34:46|0:34:54|At 10 o'clock in the evening, the door next to the window was opened, and the long-haired woman in front was suddenly pushed against the wall by the fur-coated man behind her.
0:35:9|0:35:15|The indoor lights suddenly came on, and the man in fur coat complained.
0:35:15|0:35:28|[Qin Shousheng] and several henchmen are sitting on the heated brick bed.
0:35:28|0:35:31|The man in fur coat wanted to run, but was blocked and forced back by [Qin Shousheng] standing up.
0:35:39|0:35:49|Qin Shousheng knocked down the fur-coated man with a punch and walked up to the long-haired woman.
0:35:49|0:35:59|Leng Housheng immediately stepped forward, holding a knife close to the long-haired woman's neck, and the long-haired woman spoke.
0:36:0|0:36:19|The woman with long hair took out her phone, dared not lower her head, and could only dial the number with her eyes downcast. A gloomy voice came through.
0:36:19|0:36:21|[Qin Shousheng] thought for a moment and then kicked the fur-coated man on the ground.
0:36:32|0:36:37|He turned back and squatted down in front of the man in fur.
0:36:37|0:36:45|He took out the wallet of Du Ziteng and lifted up his fur coat.
0:37:4|0:37:13|A few people were heading towards the old man's restaurant. As they approached the corner near the intersection, [Leng Housheng] spoke up.
0:37:13|0:37:27|The van came to a slow stop, with its front facing a pile of dirt on the side of the road. [Du Ziteng] got out of the car and walked over to the passenger seat, giving a pat on the head of the person sitting there. [Leng Housheng] asked, "What's going on?"
0:37:27|0:37:30|[Qin Shousheng] reached out two fingers to feel his breath.
0:37:46|0:37:48|[Qin Shousheng] instructs the henchmen in the van.
0:38:0|0:38:19|Just like that, [Qin Shousheng] followed by [Leng Housheng], with six henchmen behind them, arrived menacingly at the entrance of Old Du's restaurant. [Qin Shousheng] suddenly stopped and looked back, the people behind also quickly stopped and looked back. Suddenly, [Qin Shousheng] turned around and ran back, with the others following quickly.
0:38:19|0:38:32|After the screen turns black, we come to the third chapter. By a twist of fate, the monk in Yuanzhao Temple is bumping into the bell. Looking down from above, next door is the courtyard where [Yin Cha] is making animal noises and digging a pit, as if there is only a wall separating the two languages.
0:38:32|0:38:45|A man and a woman walk into the temple, with the girl kneeling in front of the Buddha statue.
0:38:45|0:38:52|In the courtyard, the man with a duckbill cap on his head smiled as he watched the girl kneeling in worship, clasping his hands together and pursing his lips.
0:38:52|0:38:54|At this moment, voices could be heard coming from the neighboring courtyard.
0:39:7|0:39:12|Originally, Du Ziteng's gaze had been focused on the altar.
0:39:12|0:39:22|Even when [Qin Shousheng] was placing the jar, he was also observing from outside the window. The scene shifts to the street, where a man wearing a duckbill cap walks into a black sister's jelly noodle shop.
0:39:25|0:39:30|The owner of the cold noodle shop is the girl who kneels and prays in the temple.
0:39:30|0:39:31|She brought over some cold noodles.
0:40:3|0:40:10|The girl returned to the front desk, locked eyes with the man in the baseball cap, then turned to look at the jade necklace advertisement on the TV.
0:40:10|0:40:15|A man speaks.
0:40:17|0:40:20|The man in the duckbill cap takes a sip and continues to eat noodles with his head down.
0:40:20|0:40:25|After eating, he went to the street and started stuffing flyers into car door handles.
0:40:25|0:40:36|Outside a teahouse window, he seemed to notice something, suddenly turned his head, and looked at a man and a woman inside the shop, with [Du Ziteng] pulling her hand away from her boyfriend.
0:40:36|0:40:39|The man in the duckbill cap quickly answered the phone.
0:40:55|0:41:4|The scene shifts to the two masked men stealing the jar. As they get the jar and drive away, they take off their masks, revealing themselves to be [Yin Cha] and [Yang Cu].
0:41:14|0:41:38|Leaving the restaurant of [Lao Song], [Fan Huahua] came face to face, frightening [Yang Cuo] who abruptly turned the steering wheel.
0:41:38|0:41:39|Two people walk into the restaurant.
0:41:47|0:41:50|The two walked into the restaurant of [Lao Song], and [Du Ziteng] greeted them.
0:41:55|0:42:7|The two men scanned the room, only to see [Yellow Hair] eating in the hall. Then they lifted the door curtain and entered the hall.
0:42:24|0:42:29|Chun Ge turned his head and asked in confusion.
0:42:29|0:42:34|[Yin Cha] twitched the corner of his mouth, and [Yang Cuo] watched him close his mouth tightly.
0:42:34|0:42:39|As just happened, [Chun Ge] cautiously walked into the hall.
0:42:39|0:42:52|His gaze fell on the table where [Yin Cha] dropped the glass, [Yang Cuo] who had his back turned was already sweating, discreetly keeping an eye on it, then pushing his luggage bag under the table.
0:42:52|0:42:53|Neither of them dared to look up.
0:43:4|0:43:11|[Yin Cha] hurried to his feet.
0:43:11|0:43:13|The two quickly left and got into the car.
0:43:13|0:43:18|[Yang Cuo] had just taken a sip of mineral water when it was snatched away by [Yin Cha].
0:43:18|0:43:21|[Yang Cuo], who was about to start the car, froze.
0:43:45|0:43:51|[Yin Cha] slapped [Yang Cuo] repeatedly, and finally grabbed his collar to deliver a stern warning.
0:43:51|0:43:58|At this moment, [Chun Ge] drove the police car over, and the two of them dodged backwards together. When the police car drove away, they stood up straight again.
0:44:0|0:44:6|Unexpectedly, the beastly singing car that came to pick up [Fan Huahua] drove by again, scaring [Yin Cha] to fall down.
0:44:22|0:44:26|The scene shifts to the counter of the Jade Palace, where [Yang Cuo] is leaning on the glass counter and looking around.
0:44:30|0:44:43|He took out his phone and checked the balance, 31210. The scene shifts to Black Sister's Cold Noodle Shop, where the girl is wiping the table. [Yang Cuo] arrives at the door, and the girl greets him to come in. After he walks in, he hands the paper bag to the girl.
0:44:50|0:44:54|After saying that, he left. In the evening, he started to act with Yingcha.
0:46:19|0:46:24|The van stopped in front of the dirt pile, and two people collided as they fought.
0:46:24|0:46:29|[Yang Cuo] pushed Yin Cha, only to see him fall on the dashboard, with no response.
0:46:34|0:46:42|Yang Cuo reached out to touch his nose and took a deep breath of cool air.
0:46:42|0:46:52|He lifted up Yin Cha and shook it, as if suddenly thinking of something, hesitated for a moment, then took out his wallet from the Yin Cha pocket, put it in his own pocket, and then knocked over Yin Cha.
0:47:0|0:47:15|Then he put on his hat and got off the car by himself, walked around the pile of soil, glanced at the nearby Old Du Restaurant, and noticed that the lights were still on inside. He quietly approached the window and saw Du Ziteng proposing to Song Yujiao, with Du Ziteng on one knee.
0:47:26|0:47:33|He peeked his head out and saw the luggage bag still under the table, so he crouched and walked along the wall to the backyard.
0:47:33|0:47:38|Arriving at the back door, he picked up the lock, tilted his head and poked it twice, and the lock opened.
0:47:38|0:47:46|He walked slowly into the shop, gently lifting the curtain as he passed through the rolling door, paying attention to the situation of the two people.
0:47:46|0:47:49|The two of them were cuddling against the wall at this moment.
0:47:49|0:47:54|[Yang Cuo] smoothly arrived at the table, picked up the luggage bag, but bumped into the chair.
0:47:59|0:48:17|After saying that, [Du Ziteng] kissed again, [Yang Cuo] held the luggage bag in place, found no danger, and prepared to leave. He opened the front door, placed the luggage bag first, just as he reached out to pick it up, a shot flew in, scaring him away in a hurry.
0:48:17|0:48:18|The scene shifts to Chapter Four, featuring [Gao Shou].
0:48:21|0:48:34|A motorcycle rode over a puddle, splashing mud everywhere. The person on the bike was [Yellow Hair], wearing a knitted hat and oversized glasses, riding the motorcycle onto the mountain road.
0:48:34|0:48:40|Suddenly, he realized something was wrong, his expression changed, and the motorcycle wobbled a few times before tipping over to the side.
0:48:41|0:48:44|Yellow Hair fell to the ground on his own.
0:48:44|0:48:49|After getting up, he walked around to the side of the motorcycle and saw the scattered nails on the ground.
0:48:49|0:48:53|Breathing heavily, he looked around and could only push the motorcycle to start walking.
0:48:53|0:48:56|Notice a repair shop every few steps.
0:48:56|0:49:2|He pushed the cart to the side of the road with great effort and walked forward.
0:49:15|0:49:21|The man on Tang Yi's side put on sunglasses, and the four brothers pulled out their pistols.
0:49:21|0:49:23|The man gestured towards [Tang Yi].
0:49:23|0:49:26|Uncle Wu came over and patted him on the back.
0:49:40|0:49:49|[Yellow Hair] put away his smile and looked at [Uncle Wu] who took off his sunglasses.
0:49:49|0:49:53|He clasped his hands in a fist, nodded, and then turned and left the auto repair shop.
0:49:53|0:49:58|Every two steps, the phone rings, answering the call with a wolf-like voice.
0:50:6|0:50:10|After hanging up the phone, he pursed his lips and ran on the street.
0:50:10|0:50:16|Soon, a car pulled up behind them and slowly came to a stop, asking.
0:50:16|0:50:23|The person driving the car is [Fur Coat Man].
0:50:38|0:50:44|[Leather Jacket Man] drove down a small road to a deserted area and hit the brakes.
0:51:5|0:51:10|[The man in fur coat] gets off the car and runs towards the mud wall in front of him.
0:51:10|0:51:13|Crossing over the dilapidated low mud wall, the figure disappeared.
0:51:13|0:51:20|[Yellow Hair] looked out the window, waited left and right but didn't see him coming back, couldn't help but open the car door.
0:51:26|0:51:34|He walked towards the direction where the man in fur coat ran, climbed up the earthen wall, looked down but didn't see anyone.
0:51:34|0:51:45|At this moment, the sound of a car starting came from below, and [Yellow Hair] quickly ran down.
0:51:45|0:51:50|Only Du Ziteng could watch as the leather-clad man drove the car away, walking desolately on the road.
0:52:2|0:52:6|He looks at his phone.
0:52:6|0:52:11|He looked around and put his phone in his pocket.
0:52:11|0:52:13|Not far away is the Langdu Hotel.
0:52:13|0:52:16|Just around the corner of the dirt pile, [Fan Huahua] drove over.
0:52:24|0:52:28|Yellow Hair is sitting by the roadside.
0:52:28|0:52:35|He struggled to stand up, looked at his palm, and then flipped the middle finger in the direction where [Fan Huahua] had left.
0:52:35|0:52:41|Turning around and clapping his hands, he noticed the old Du restaurant across the street and walked in.
0:53:11|0:53:15|Du Ziteng, blowing up a balloon, gestured to the male waiter to give it to Yellow Hair.
0:53:15|0:53:17|Just as the phone was charged, the waitress brought the dishes.
0:53:20|0:53:25|The waitress said to him.
0:53:25|0:53:35|Looking at the unfamiliar food in front of him, [Yellow Hair] touched his mouth, blinked, picked up the rice cake, shook it, and then put it into his mouth.
0:53:35|0:53:37|At this moment, [Chun Ge] walked over.
0:54:9|0:54:24|[Yellow Hair] put down the money he took out from his woolen hat and got up to leave, [Du Ziteng] caught up with him.
0:54:24|0:54:29|[Du Ziteng] turned around and looked at the tables in the shop, then turned back to look at the departing [Yellow Hair].
0:54:29|0:54:32|By the roadside, [Yellow Hair] gets off the truck driven by the driver.
0:54:36|0:54:57|Walking along the road while looking at the fully charged phone, the aunt selling meatballs and beef steaks on the side of the road is calling out.
0:54:57|0:55:1|She turned around and noticed something, then quickly rushed to [Lao Gen]'s side.
0:55:11|0:55:16|Yellow Hair looked helplessly at Lao Gen and Auntie, ready to grab the bag and leave.
0:55:16|0:55:21|Unexpectedly, [Lao Gen] yanked off his woolen hat, causing it to fall to the ground.
0:55:21|0:55:26|[Lao Gen] raised the stick in his hand and hit [Yellow Hair]'s arm, then struck towards his body.
0:55:26|0:55:44|[Yellow Hair] kept backing away, the scene shifted to [Fan Huahua], who was tearing off a face mask in front of a mirror. After taking off the mask, she seemed to hear something, looked outside, then unfolded the mask and continued applying it in front of the mirror.
0:55:44|0:55:49|Another sound rang out, she turned her head, patted her face mask, and got up to walk towards the door.
0:55:52|0:56:8|In the corridor, a kitten is by the window sill.
0:56:8|0:56:14|Turning around, it was covered by [Yellow Hair], and at this moment, [Du Ziteng] arrived in the courtyard carrying a suitcase.
0:56:48|0:56:58|Watching [Du Ziteng] leave, [Yellow Hair] said.
0:56:58|0:57:14|Yellow Hair knocked out Fan Huahua with a punch, then walked into the courtyard, picked up the briefcase left by Du Ziteng containing five hundred thousand, tapped it, reached out to wipe off the dust inside the house, then raised the corners of his mouth, walked towards the door, sidestepped out from the door crack, and closed the door.
0:57:22|0:57:34|It turns out to be [Uncle Wu], [Yellow Hair] lying on the ground, the screen goes black, and we arrive at Chapter Five. [Uncle Wu], he is walking out of the detention center.
0:57:34|0:57:39|[Uncle Wu] walked forward with his hands in his pockets, while the four brothers over there were waiting for him by the car.
0:57:40|0:57:43|No one said a word as Uncle Wu walked with his toes pointing outwards.
0:57:43|0:57:51|Until [Uncle Wu] came forward, the bald brother extended his arm to invite him into the car, and then the other four people all got into the car.
0:57:51|0:57:56|In the blink of an eye, the five of them drove to a bathhouse to take a bath.
0:57:56|0:58:2|The four brothers sat together, with an ashtray on the table in front of them. [Uncle Wu] emerged from the water tank.
0:58:3|0:58:13|With his arm stretched out, he then took a towel and covered his head with it, turned his head, picked up a cigarette next to the ashtray, and then lit it with a lighter.
0:58:13|0:58:20|Turning back, his body slowly slid down, took a deep drag of the cigarette, and as he exhaled the smoke, he fell into a reverie.
0:58:29|0:58:38|Uncle Wu stood in the middle of the casino, reached out his hand, and then turned to look at the small window behind him.
0:58:38|0:58:42|He recalled [Qin Shousheng]'s words in the detention center.
0:58:54|0:59:2|Saying that, he reached out his hand towards [Uncle Wu], then bent his fingers to bid farewell.
0:59:2|0:59:10|At the end of the flashback, [Uncle Wu] had a cigarette hanging from his mouth, tilting his head back. The bald brother leaned towards him and started massaging his back.
0:59:34|0:59:38|Uncle Wu flicks the cigarette away, bald brother.
0:59:38|0:59:46|The big brother across the way picked up the cigarette butt and threw it outside the pool, [Uncle Wu] reached out his arm and stopped the bald brother.
0:59:52|0:59:57|The scene shifts, and five people arrive at a dimly lit massage parlor, with the masseur stepping forward.
1:0:29|1:0:34|Uncle Wu sat up and crawled to the front of the priest.
1:0:37|1:0:41|The technician turns out to be the girlfriend of Yin Cha, [Yi Meng].
1:0:41|1:0:44|Uncle Wu watched him walk away, then slowly turned back and spoke.
1:0:46|1:0:50|And at this moment, [Qin Shousheng] is at the scene digging a pit.
1:0:54|1:0:58|Uncle Wu moves his body forward, squinting his eyes.
1:0:58|1:1:4|After the massage, he brought his four brothers to the "Rabbit Head Hall" and stopped at the door.
1:1:6|1:1:9|This time, his call was answered.
1:1:9|1:1:14|Uncle Wu leans in to look at the phone.
1:1:14|1:1:18|This is the time when the beasts hide their jars.
1:1:21|1:1:23|Several people walked into the [Rabbit Head Inn].
1:1:23|1:1:26|On a kang, several people are eating [Rabbit Head].
1:1:26|1:1:27|Uncle Wu is holding a rabbit's head.
1:1:33|1:1:38|Uncle Wu paused with the rabbit head in his hand, about to take a bite.
1:1:38|1:1:44|At this moment, it was [Qin Shousheng] who answered the phone at Lao Du's restaurant.
1:1:44|1:1:48|[Du Ziteng] and [Fan Huahua] are sitting down, he turns his back to pick up.
1:1:59|1:2:6|[Qin Shousheng] hung up the phone, and the bald brother looked at his phone. The big brother sitting across from him spoke up.
1:2:10|1:2:16|[Uncle Wu] pinched the rabbit's head, his eyes downcast as he tugged at the corner of his mouth, lost in memories.
1:2:16|1:2:20|When he was arrested, he looked towards the small window, negotiating with [Qin Shousheng].
1:2:36|1:2:37|Soon after.
1:2:50|1:3:0|Later, several people arrived at Heimei's Cold Noodle Shop. After finishing a bowl of cold noodles, [Uncle Wu] took out two pieces of paper to wipe his mouth, then threw them on the table and looked towards the door.
1:3:4|1:3:12|[Uncle Wu] rolled his tongue in his mouth, then took out his phone, unlocked it, opened the album, clicked on the photo of Yellow Hair, and turned to ask the landlady.
1:3:17|1:3:21|The landlady [Soft Girl] glanced forward and shook her head.
1:3:51|1:4:10|At this moment, [Yellow Hair] was still riding a motorcycle when a young man emerged from the roadside weeds and picked up a walkie-talkie.
1:4:15|1:4:20|Bald Brother also emerged, took out nails from his waist bag, and scattered them on the road.
1:4:20|1:4:26|Just like before, [Yellow Hair] fell down, and Bald Brother spoke.
1:4:26|1:4:33|As happened before, [Uncle Wu] watched as [Yellow Hair] approached.
1:4:33|1:4:35|The bald brother grabbed Yellow Hair's bag.
1:4:49|1:4:54|[Yellow Hair] turned around, clasping his hands in a fist, showing respect for [Uncle Wu]'s righteousness.
1:4:54|1:4:58|Watching him leave, [Uncle Wu] took out a cigarette and put it in his mouth.
1:4:58|1:5:2|The four brothers picked up their pistols, pulled the triggers, only to find out they were all lighters.
1:5:26|1:5:32|In the evening, [Uncle Wu] went to [Qin Shousheng]'s house and met [Yellow Hair] who had just come out at the door.
1:5:32|1:5:42|Swinging a stick, after [Yellow Hair] fell to the ground, he squatted down and opened the dropped briefcase, seeing that it was full of money. Then he looked back at [Yellow Hair].
1:5:55|1:6:0|After entering the door, he walked into the courtyard carrying a suitcase, and then stood still and shouted into the house.
1:6:5|1:6:9|Hearing the sound of water splashing in the room, he smiled.
1:6:39|1:6:50|[Fan Huahua], tied to a chair with her mouth gagged by [Yellow Hair], is struggling as [Uncle Wu] walks out and squats down.
1:6:50|1:6:55|After speaking to Yellow Hair lying on the ground, he stood up, looked around, and then left.
1:7:2|1:7:9|His index finger and thumb pinched the cigarette butt, flicked it and threw it on the ground, then he strode into the square dance group.
1:7:9|1:7:15|He held a suitcase in his hands, spinning in the middle of the crowd, then joined the aunties waving fans.
1:7:15|1:7:35|With a big smile on his face, he walked to the side of the road. Just as he stepped onto the road, his feet were still stepping on scraps of cloth when the car lights shone on his face. He turned his head and saw a car coming towards him. [Uncle Wu] widened his eyes and mouth, then he was knocked down by the car, with money scattered around. The screen went black, and we arrived at Chapter Six, "A Dream of Red Mansions".
1:7:35|1:7:36|Du Ziteng is putting on makeup.
1:8:31|1:8:38|[Yin Cha] pursed his lips, while on the other side, the leather-jacketed man behind the dirt pile was squatting and tying his shoelaces.
1:8:49|1:8:58|He climbed up the dirt pile, saw Uncle Wu and Yellow Hair, turned and ran to the car, put on sunglasses, and stood up the sign of the empty car.
1:8:58|1:9:2|Sure enough, not long after, [Yellow Hair] who was running was caught up with.
1:9:2|1:9:9|He slowly stopped the car, lowered his sunglasses, and leaned over to ask.
1:9:9|1:9:12|He who had previously used the excuse of going to the bathroom hid on the side to observe.
1:9:14|1:9:20|See [Yellow Hair] get off the car and immediately rush back.
1:9:20|1:9:24|He confirmed through the rearview mirror that he had already left [Yellow Hair] behind.
1:9:24|1:9:29|Driving to the main road, they stopped next to a building.
1:9:29|1:9:34|He unbuckled his seatbelt and took Yellow Hair's bag from the back seat.
1:9:34|1:9:37|Found a wallet inside, sure enough, there was a stack of money.
1:9:37|1:9:42|He continued to search excitedly, but his expression changed when he took out a gun.
1:9:46|1:9:57|Startled, he took a look and saw it was [Lao Gen], so he rolled down the window.
1:9:57|1:10:8|The man in the leather jacket suddenly remembered something and reached into his inner pocket.
1:10:8|1:10:10|He thought of something and his eyes rolled.
1:10:12|1:10:16|[Lao Gen] turned around, and the man in the leather jacket walked down with [Yellow Hair]'s bag.
1:10:16|1:10:21|After a while, in the massage parlor, [Yi Meng]'s phone showed an incoming call from [Huang Liang].
1:10:21|1:10:24|After speaking, [Yi Meng] walked into the corridor and went downstairs.
1:10:40|1:10:49|After looking at the phone, he wanted to run to the corner of the wall, still checking if anyone was coming over, then smiled and dialed the phone.
1:10:59|1:11:5|After hanging up the phone, [Huang Liang] rested one arm on the car and dialed another number.
1:11:8|1:11:15|The scene shifts to inside a teahouse, where [Huang Liang], dressed in fur, is holding a rose by the window.
1:11:15|1:11:20|Sitting across from her is [Yi Meng], and outside is the car she rented.
1:11:20|1:11:23|She smelled the rose and headed towards [Yi Meng].
1:11:54|1:11:59|[Huang Liang] held [Yi Meng]'s hand and pulled down the sunglasses.
1:11:59|1:12:3|Next, they are going to reach out to [Yi Meng]'s hand.
1:12:9|1:12:14|Yang Zuo, who happened to see this scene, quickly received a phone call and left.
1:12:14|1:12:25|In the evening, [Yi Meng] took [Huang Liang] home, but as soon as they entered the door, [Huang Liang] pulled [Yi Meng].
1:12:25|1:12:30|[Yi Meng] pulled him inside, holding a doll, and [Leng Housheng] was stunned when he saw the two entering the room.
1:13:0|1:13:5|After Qin Shousheng left, Yi Meng closed the door and leaned against the wall, asking Huang Liang who was lying on the ground.
1:13:38|1:13:42|[Yi Meng] squatted in front of [Yellow Bird], the two of them locking eyes.
1:13:42|1:13:46|The screen goes black, leading to the grand finale, the secret formula.
1:13:46|1:13:52|At the entrance of Lao Du's restaurant, [Yang Cuo] was scared away by a gunshot and hid behind the truck used for the performance.
1:13:52|1:13:56|[Yin Cha] and the others across the way once again peeked their heads out.
1:13:56|1:14:4|Du Ziteng emerged, and as he approached the luggage, Yin Cha had already raised his gun.
1:14:4|1:14:30|Seeing [Du Ziteng] return to the hall, [Yin Cha] commanded! Several people ran across the street to the outside of the store, where [Yang Cuo] was startled by a sudden group of people and began to observe. Inside the store, [Du Ziteng] was crawling on the ground towards the window. [Qin Shousheng] was holding a gun, while [Leng Housheng] bent down to pick up a luggage bag. [Yang Cuo] was standing aside, breathing heavily and gritting his teeth.
1:14:38|1:14:43|Unexpectedly, [Yang Cuo] flew over.
1:14:43|1:14:48|The beastly sound of gunfire rang out, but there were no bullets left.
1:14:48|1:14:52|Only a few people reacted before [Song Yujiao] saw [Du Ziteng] turning around.
1:15:16|1:15:23|[Song Yujiao] had tears in her eyes, [Du Ziteng] ran out of the door, secretly forgetting, and picked up a brick from the ground.
1:15:31|1:15:34|The scene shifts to the street, with [Yi Meng] asking Huang Liang.
1:16:0|1:16:5|Silently, [Huang Liang], who was choked, dropped his head again, and [Yi Meng] continued to ask him.
1:16:43|1:16:46|At this moment, [Song Siyuan] regains consciousness after the car accident.
1:16:46|1:16:51|[Yi Meng] answered the phone and turned on the speakerphone.
1:17:17|1:17:23|In the car, the two locked eyes.
1:17:23|1:17:30|Uncle Wu, who had just stepped onto the road, was hit and sent flying, with hundred yuan bills fluttering to the ground.
1:17:30|1:17:34|Uncle Wu rolled on the ground for several circles, leaving a pool of blood on the ground.
1:17:37|1:17:45|[Huang Liang] and [Yi Meng] were both startled by the sudden scene, took a deep breath, and it was [Huang Liang] who got off the car first.
1:17:45|1:17:53|First, the screen is filled with scattered banknotes, followed by [Song Siyuan] lying on the ground and a suitcase in the distance.
1:17:53|1:18:1|At this moment, [Yi Meng] also got out of the car, looking at the scene in front of them. The two slowly turned to look at each other, and [Huang Liang] thought for a moment before saying.
1:18:28|1:18:32|[Yi Meng] hung up the phone on Yin Cha and looked at [Huang Liang].
1:18:32|1:18:43|Before long, the two drove away, leaving only [Uncle Wu] lying on the ground with a hundred yuan bill pressed under his face, watching the departing car.
1:18:43|1:18:57|At the same time, [Yellow Hair], who was knocked down by [Uncle Wu], regained consciousness. He quickly sat up, adjusted his glasses, looked around, and propped up one leg while catching his breath.
1:19:6|1:19:16|With a headache, she held her head and walked slowly to the entrance of Heimei's Cold Noodle Shop, looked up, and walked in.
1:19:31|1:19:36|Yellow Hair sat down at the table next to him, while Soft Girl walked into the kitchen.
1:19:36|1:19:41|Before long, as Yellow Hair was taking off his gloves, Soft Girl walked over with a bowl of jelly noodles.
1:19:41|1:19:45|[Yellow Hair] picked up the cold noodles, took a sniff, and started eating with chopsticks.
1:19:45|1:19:48|[Soft Girl] glanced at him and returned to the front desk.
1:19:48|1:19:55|Thinking of the daytime agreement, Du Ziteng took out the jewelry box from the bag and opened it, revealing a jade necklace that shone like the television.
1:19:56|1:20:3|He took out the necklace with surprise, and [Yellow Hair] turned his head and noticed the necklace.
1:20:10|1:20:17|He was about to step back and leave, but he was hit with a stick.
1:20:27|1:20:35|He put the necklace back on the table.
1:20:35|1:20:39|In this way, [Yellow Hair] was beaten by [Lao Gen] and fled in panic.
1:20:39|1:20:46|At this moment, Sakura Tea regains consciousness after the car accident.
1:20:46|1:20:52|Yingcha suddenly noticed the van next to him, looked around, and opened the car door.
1:20:52|1:20:55|The van driver noticed the noise and also opened the door.
1:20:56|1:21:2|After getting off the car, gently closing the door, preparing to walk around to the back to see the situation.
1:21:2|1:21:7|Unexpectedly, [Yin Cha] came around from the front and raised his hand to deliver a knife strike.
1:21:7|1:21:12|[Yin Cha] helped the unconscious driver up and put him into the van by opening the door.
1:21:12|1:21:14|At this moment, someone was heard running over.
1:21:15|1:21:25|[Yin Cha] hid beside the car, while [Yang Cuo] who ran over was peering into the car. He was knocked down by [Yin Cha] with a single knife hand and then placed in the car.
1:21:25|1:21:31|At this moment, Du Ziteng and others caught up.
1:21:34|1:21:39|[Qin Shousheng] and the others immediately caught up, then [Du Ziteng] also caught up.
1:21:49|1:21:53|[Qin Shousheng] had already run ahead, while [Lao Song] was just left lying on the ground.
1:21:53|1:22:0|At this moment, on the brightly lit street, [Yellow Hair] is slowly pedaling his bicycle.
1:22:0|1:22:6|As a result, the police car in front turned on its lights, and [Chun Ge] and a team of police officers stopped on the main road.
1:22:6|1:22:10|Yellow Hair stopped the bike and walked up, Chun Ge asked.
1:22:42|1:22:56|Yellow Hair, who had just turned around, realized something was wrong. Chun Ge said to his subordinates behind him.
1:22:56|1:23:3|Two police officers handcuff [Yellow Hair] and take him away, as the sky changes from dark to light.
1:23:3|1:23:10|In the woods in the countryside, the sunlight shines through, with [Yin Cha] running ahead carrying a luggage bag.
1:23:10|1:23:16|[Qin Shousheng] and his men are in the back, with [Du Ziteng] still chasing after them.
1:23:16|1:23:21|[Yin Cha] stopped to catch his breath, while [Qin Shousheng] also slowed down his pace.
1:23:21|1:23:30|The sunlight was glaring at this moment, with [Leng Housheng] and another henchman supporting each other to move forward.
1:23:30|1:23:37|[Du Ziteng] stopped swinging his arms and looked at the sun, the mist he exhaled was very obvious in the early morning.
1:23:37|1:23:39|They ran through the woods and arrived at the reed field.
1:23:42|1:23:43|Running on one side.
1:23:46|1:24:8|The subordinates couldn't hold on any longer, falling in the reeds one by one. [Du Ziteng] caught up and surpassed them.
1:24:8|1:24:10|They ran through the reed field and then ran onto the loess land.
1:24:12|1:24:18|Under the sunlight, the dust and flying hair reflected the light.
1:24:18|1:24:25|They ran across the loess land and arrived at a grassy field.
1:24:25|1:24:32|Finally, after crossing the grassland, Yin Cha stopped in front of a small mound of soil, tears pooling on the ground.
1:24:32|1:24:37|[Du Ziteng] propped up his knees and pointed a gun at him.
1:26:9|1:26:14|[Du Ziteng] was startled, [Qin Shousheng] raised his gun and swung it towards [Yin Cha]'s head.
1:26:14|1:26:21|[Yingcha] fell to the ground, he picked up the luggage bag and waved the gun.
1:26:21|1:26:36|He was about to leave with his luggage, [Du Ziteng] looked at him. He reached out his hand weakly, watching [Qin Shousheng] run away. Then he turned around, struggled to stand up, and staggered over.
1:26:36|1:26:39|Looking at the person lying on the ground, he was ready to turn around and leave.
1:26:41|1:26:59|And at this moment, in the reed field, [Leng Housheng] is searching.
1:26:59|1:27:5|On the other side, [Yi Meng] looked happily at the suitcase and then turned around.
1:27:24|1:27:30|[Yin Cha] ran with a luggage bag clamped under one arm and a gun in the other hand. Suddenly, he stopped and unzipped the bag.
1:27:40|1:27:55|He tucked the luggage bag back between his arms, but slipped down after taking two steps forward.
1:27:55|1:28:0|Yin Cha, who couldn't stop his steps due to inertia, collided with the car driven by Huang Liang, and the luggage flew out.
1:28:43|1:28:48|[Qin Shousheng] crawled towards the luggage bag, while [Yi Meng] and Huang Liang looked around in the car.
1:28:48|1:28:58|[Qin Shousheng] hugged the luggage bag, and two people got off the car. He quickly pulled out a gun.
1:28:58|1:29:1|At this moment, [Qin Shousheng] still had no idea.
1:29:4|1:29:5|The expert is holding a jar.
1:29:9|1:29:16|He unzipped the bag, and the jar inside had already shattered into pieces.
1:29:35|1:29:59|He took out a piece of debris, looked at it, threw it on the ground, then took out a large piece of debris, tilted his head back, opened his mouth wide, and closed his eyes.

1:32:43|1:32:52|[Lao Song] smiled at the top of his head, but with his hand he touched his forehead, and [Song Yujiao]'s eyes became moist as she smiled.
1:32:52|1:32:59|[Du Ziteng] nodded with a smile, it turned out that the secret recipe of [Lao Song] was his daughter [Song Yujiao].
