0:0:38|0:0:49|A photographer with a DSLR camera looks into the distance, picks up the camera to capture the hardworking moments of the stone miners.
0:0:49|0:0:54|The men who quarry the stone are swinging hammers, driving the stone nails one by one into the rocks.
0:0:56|0:1:3|On the other side, two women splashed water at each other and played around, standing on the stones in the stream washing clothes together.
0:1:3|0:1:12|The photographer aimed the camera at the colored stone craftsmen, quickly pressed the shutter button, and then turned and walked into the woods.
0:1:12|0:1:21|The sounds of women laughing and chatting while doing laundry could be heard from a distance. The photographer quickly approached, wanting to capture the scene of women washing clothes.
0:1:25|0:1:33|On the other side, the men who were stepping on stones were sweating profusely under the scorching sun as they vigorously swung hammers and used crowbars to pry open the large stone slabs.
0:1:33|0:1:37|The photographer by the river couldn't help but take a few more photos of the woman with a bright smile.
0:1:58|0:2:3|A large rock on the mountain slid down the slope and heavily hit the ground.
0:2:3|0:2:7|The photographer and the women heard a noise and immediately looked towards the hillside.
0:2:7|0:2:13|The woman washing clothes quickly got up, threw down the clothes, pushed aside the person next to her, and ran towards the hillside.
0:2:13|0:2:17|The woman behind also caught up immediately.
0:2:17|0:2:22|[Wu Zheng] saw the woman looking nervous, and quickly raised his camera to capture this moment.
0:2:22|0:2:26|Other women heard the shout and also ran towards the mountain.
0:2:27|0:2:34|The woman at the front ran into the mountains in one breath, rushing anxiously towards the scene of the accident.
0:2:34|0:2:45|Unexpectedly, this moment was also captured by [Wu Zheng], frozen in the photo, as the camera slowly zoomed out.
0:2:49|0:2:51|Everyone came to visit [Wu Zheng]'s home one after another.
0:3:44|0:3:47|[Wu Zheng] picked up the woman's photo and said with a lowered head.
0:3:55|0:3:58|The camera then pans to the English woman in the photo.
0:4:2|0:4:5|Due to her husband's injury, she found [Feng Laoqing] at the factory.
0:4:5|0:4:7|[Feng Laoqing] leisurely took a sip of tea.
0:4:40|0:4:42|Feng Laoqing is getting anxious now.
0:5:9|0:5:10|Shui Xiu couldn't answer for a moment.
0:5:12|0:5:14|At this moment, a woman walked in carrying a teacup.
0:5:15|0:5:17|The woman put down the teacup and turned to [Feng Laoqing].
0:5:47|0:5:49|Shui Xiu walked forward upon hearing this.
0:5:53|0:5:55|After speaking, [Shui Xiu] left quietly.
0:6:1|0:6:9|In the courtyard, a man with long legs sat on a bench, struggling to peel corn, with a pair of crutches beside him.
0:6:9|0:6:18|[Shui Xiu] walked into the courtyard with a basket of vegetables, saw the man and smiled, then placed the basket on the table and turned to look at the man.
0:6:41|0:6:48|[Shui Xiu] listened to the man's words, picked up a basket of corn, and squatted in front of the man.
0:6:48|0:6:54|The man, upon hearing Shui Xiu's words, worked angrily, venting the doubts in his heart.
0:7:3|0:7:9|The camera cuts to an old man sitting at a table in the courtyard, as a girl walks over carrying dishes.
0:8:0|0:8:6|The girl heard the voice of [Shui Xiu] and got up to greet her.
0:8:6|0:8:12|[Shui Xiu] sat down at the table and took out a piece of paper from her pocket, handing it to [Feng Laoqing].
0:8:12|0:8:15|The girl looked at the paper on the table, then glanced at [Shui Xiu] with confusion.
0:9:22|0:9:25|[Feng Laoqing] suddenly pushed aside the documents on the table.
0:9:26|0:9:28|[Shui Xiu] angrily gets up, takes the evidence, and leaves.
0:9:37|0:9:41|Night fell in the blink of an eye, and the village was filled with a sense of peace and harmony.
0:9:41|0:9:46|In the courtyard, the dilapidated adobe house is the family's small kitchen, where [Shui Xiu] is preparing Chinese medicine for [Feng Laoqing].
0:9:47|0:9:53|She blew on the steaming Chinese medicine while carefully pouring it out.
0:9:53|0:9:56|Following that, [Shui Xiu] carried Chinese medicine and walked into the room.
0:9:56|0:10:3|The furniture in the room looks old, with only an old TV and some simple tables, chairs, and sofas.
0:10:3|0:10:6|[Feng Yucheng] is sitting on the sofa reading a book.
0:10:12|0:10:15|[Shui Xiu] finished giving instructions and then turned to start organizing the clothes piled on the chair.
0:10:23|0:10:27|He picked up the clothes and started to tidy them up on the table, one by one.
0:11:10|0:11:13|After speaking, [Shui Xiu] walked out of the room.
0:11:13|0:11:19|[Feng Yucheng] struggled to stand up with the support of his crutches.
0:11:20|0:11:23|Shui Xiu hurriedly turned around to help her.
0:11:58|0:12:5|Feng Yucheng struggled to move his lower body and continued, "I can't give you anything."
0:12:10|0:12:16|Shui Xiu stepped forward, bent down, and hugged Feng Laoqing with great tenderness.
0:12:36|0:12:48|In the blink of an eye, it was the next morning. [Shui Xiu] was about to wash clothes with a basin in hand when [Liu Yuhai]'s wife stopped her. She took out a bulging handkerchief from her pocket.
0:13:7|0:13:13|After speaking, [Shui Xiu] decisively walked past [Feng Laoqing].
0:13:13|0:13:15|[Feng Laoqing] hurriedly stopped [Shui Xiu].
0:13:20|0:13:23|After saying that, [Shui Xiu] picked up the basin and left without looking back.
0:13:23|0:13:26|The scene changes, with [Wu Zheng] making a phone call on the roadside.
0:13:33|0:13:42|But don't forget, when she heard the word "law", [Shui Xiu] paused for a moment, but then decided to walk away.
0:13:42|0:13:46|[Wu Zheng] turned around and, upon seeing the figure of [Shui Xiu], quickly called out to him.
0:13:50|0:13:53|Shui Xiu turned around, and Wu Zheng immediately recognized him.
0:13:54|0:13:57|[Shui Xiu] looked at [Wu Zheng] with a puzzled expression and asked.
0:14:4|0:14:6|[Shui Xiu] brings [Wu Zheng] back home.
0:14:23|0:14:25|[Feng Yucheng] warmly greeted [Wu Zheng] to sit down.
0:14:42|0:14:48|[Wu Zheng] took out money from his pocket and handed it to [Feng Yucheng], while [Shui Xiu] looked at the two of them, a smile appearing on her face.
0:14:48|0:14:54|From then on, [Wu Zheng] stayed at [Shui Xiu]'s house. One night, [Shui Xiu] knocked on [Wu Zheng]'s door.
0:15:1|0:15:4|[Shui Xiu] looked at [Wu Zheng], wanting to say something but hesitating.
0:15:12|0:15:17|Upon hearing Wu Zheng's words, Shui Xiu shyly sat down at the table.
0:16:11|0:16:15|Shui Xiu listened to Wu Zheng's words thoughtfully.
0:16:18|0:16:22|[Wu Zheng] turned around, searching for something in the bag.
0:16:29|0:16:32|[Wu Zheng] stood still holding the envelope.
0:16:32|0:16:41|The scene shifts, a man playing cards in the car sees [Shui Xiu] pushing a bicycle and immediately walks up to her.
0:16:41|0:16:49|The man looked down at [Shui Xiu].
0:16:49|0:16:50|[Shui Xiu] glanced at him.
0:17:25|0:17:29|Erniuzi watched as [Shui Xiu] walked away, feeling so anxious that he was pulling his ears.
0:17:29|0:17:38|On the other side, [Shui Xiu] rode a bicycle across a long stone bridge, the winding mountain road was very tortuous, and the magnificent mountains made [Shui Xiu] appear very small.
0:17:38|0:17:43|The wind blowing by the river lifted [Shui Xiu]'s mood, and she felt no fatigue at all riding her bike.
0:17:46|0:17:53|A large truck whizzed past [Shui Xiu] on the road, and she rode her bike all the way to the countryside.
0:17:53|0:18:0|She pushed her bicycle into a courtyard, and after entering the courtyard, she looked around in all directions.
0:18:0|0:18:2|Shui Xiu found Director Liu.
0:19:0|0:19:4|[Shui Xiu], ignoring Director Liu's attempts to stop her, picked up her bag and walked out calmly.
0:19:4|0:19:11|Ren Ping ignored all calls and continued riding her bike to the entrance of the county government. A security guard stepped forward to stop her.
0:19:19|0:19:22|Upon hearing the security guard's words, [Shui Xiu] turned her head to look.
0:19:22|0:19:27|After speaking, [Shui Xiu] helplessly turned the bicycle around and headed towards the direction of the petition bureau.
0:19:27|0:19:31|Suddenly, strong winds swept through the sky, accompanied by flashes of lightning and thunder.
0:19:31|0:19:37|[Feng Yucheng] came to the yard at home with a cane, looking worriedly at the dark sky.
0:19:37|0:19:40|Suddenly, a loud thunderclap, followed by a torrential downpour from the sky.
0:19:42|0:19:50|He anxiously leaned on his cane, came to the stone table, afraid that the corn would get wet, quickly lifted one cane, and covered the corn with plastic film.
0:19:50|0:19:56|At this moment, [Wu Zheng] happened to return home and saw [Feng Yucheng] accidentally falling down.
0:19:56|0:20:1|Another loud thunder, the rain pouring down harder. [Wu Zheng] quickly helped [Feng Yucheng] lay out the plastic sheet.
0:20:3|0:20:10|Then she pulled him up from the ground, wrapped her arms around his waist, and staggered quickly towards the house.
0:20:10|0:20:15|On the other side, [Shui Xiu] pushed her bicycle and hurriedly arrived at a bus stop sign to take shelter from the rain.
0:20:15|0:20:21|Holding a cloth bag, he could only watch helplessly as the storm with heavy rain and strong winds approached him.
0:20:21|0:20:25|Under the cover of night, the entire street was accompanied only by a small bus stop sign.
0:20:27|0:20:32|Upon seeing this, [Shui Xiu] took a deep breath, pushed her bicycle forward and continued riding in the rain.
0:20:32|0:20:39|Finally finding an inn, [Shui Xiu] quickly ran inside after parking her bicycle.
0:20:39|0:20:41|The female boss looked at [Shui Xiu] and asked:
0:20:52|0:20:56|The female boss cracked melon seeds and said impatiently,
0:20:57|0:21:5|[Shui Xiu] picked up her bag and walked out of the guesthouse. She glanced at the sky outside, gritted her teeth, and pushed her bicycle into the heavy rain.
0:21:5|0:21:11|The rain poured harder and harder, [Shui Xiu] quickly lifted the front of the car and started running in the rain.
0:21:11|0:21:15|At this moment, [Feng Yucheng] and [Wu Zheng] at home prepared food and started drinking.
0:21:15|0:21:16|[Feng Yucheng] looked at [Wu Zheng] and said,
0:22:7|0:22:10|After Feng Yucheng finished speaking, tears welled up in his eyes.
0:22:10|0:22:22|[Shui Xiu] pushed his bicycle to the entrance of the petition office in the pouring rain. He crouched down at the entrance, looking very small and vulnerable.
0:22:22|0:22:29|On the other side, Feng Yucheng thought of his tragic experience, unable to help but hold his head in pain, tears streaming down his face.
0:22:45|0:22:51|[Shui Xiu] squatted at the entrance of the petition office, holding her bag, with the cold rain beating down on her face.
0:22:51|0:22:54|Accompanied by the nightfall, [Shui Xiu] wearily closed her eyes.
0:22:57|0:23:3|The next day in the early morning, [Shui Xiu] fell asleep squatting at the entrance of the petition office, hugging her bag.
0:23:3|0:23:10|The bright sunlight made [Shui Xiu] slowly open her eyes, she looked around and ran her hand through her hair.
0:23:10|0:23:17|Before long, the staff from the petition office walked over and opened the door from the hall.
0:23:17|0:23:22|[Shui Xiu] quickly got up and rubbed her stiff legs that had been sitting on the ground for a long time.
0:23:22|0:23:24|She tidied up her clothes again and combed her hair.
0:23:26|0:23:32|Carrying the bag in her hand, [Shui Xiu] followed the staff into the gate of the petition office.
0:23:32|0:23:37|After leaving the petition bureau, [Shui Xiu] rode her bike on the way home.
0:23:37|0:23:41|The experience of hitting a wall everywhere yesterday made her unable to help but shed tears.
0:23:41|0:23:45|After a day and night of exhausting travel, she was already worn out.
0:23:45|0:23:49|When riding across the same stone bridge as yesterday, [Shui Xiu] struggled to pedal the bike.
0:23:51|0:23:56|But in the end, he was physically exhausted and had to get off the car to push it slowly forward.
0:23:56|0:24:1|The beautiful scenery, however, did not lift the weary spirits of [Shui Xiu].
0:24:1|0:24:5|His steps gradually slowed down, as if all his strength had been exhausted.
0:24:6|0:24:11|[Shui Xiu] stopped the car, panting heavily, feeling dizzy from not having eaten.
0:24:11|0:24:21|Afterwards, she wiped the sweat off her forehead, adjusted her breathing continuously, and once again looked towards the direction of home with a determined gaze. 
0:24:21|0:24:27|[Shui Xiu] rode her bicycle, continuing along the winding and rugged mountain road.
0:24:27|0:24:32|She came to a section of uphill stone road, and the bicycle seemed to have turned into a thousand pounds.
0:24:35|0:24:39|She was panting heavily, her gaze no longer firm.
0:24:39|0:24:46|Suddenly, everything went black and [Shui Xiu] collapsed on the road due to exhaustion.
0:24:46|0:24:52|When she opened her eyes again, a group of people surrounded her.
0:24:52|0:24:58|Amid the crowd's shouts, [Shui Xiu] finally saw [Feng Yucheng] and the girl in front of him.
0:24:58|0:25:1|She leaned weakly against the pillow and said.
0:25:27|0:25:33|Village chief [Feng Laoqing] learned that [Shui Xiu] had fainted, and he also rushed over panting heavily.
0:25:37|0:25:38|[Shui Xiu] sat up abruptly.
0:27:7|0:27:9|[Feng Laoqing] picked up the sausage in his hand.
0:27:13|0:27:17|After speaking, [Feng Laoqing] threw the book down and walked away without looking back.
0:27:17|0:27:24|Shui Xiu angrily looked at the sausage at the end of the bed, bent down suddenly, picked it up and took a big bite.
0:27:24|0:27:27|The sight of [Feng Laoqing] eating voraciously directly amused everyone.
0:27:28|0:27:33|[Shui Xiu] was so angry that she even amused herself.
0:27:33|0:27:36|On the other side, Er Niu took the initiative to find [Liu Yuhai].
0:28:21|0:28:25|The scene changes, [Wu Zheng] takes out a photo and hands it to [Shui Xiu].
0:28:25|0:28:28|The photo shows a scene of [Shui Xiu] and the girl washing clothes.
0:29:9|0:29:12|After speaking, [Wu Zheng] quickly took out a follow-up letter from his pocket.
0:30:7|0:30:13|Due to the network being down, [Shui Xiu] is experiencing the beauty of nature with the girl and [Wu Zheng].
0:30:13|0:30:20|The three of them walked side by side towards the depths of the forest, surrounded by rolling mountains and lush trees.
0:30:20|0:30:23|The villagers' houses appear very small in front of the mountains.
0:30:35|0:30:41|Upon returning to the village, [Wu Zheng] gazed at the distant mountains, seemingly lost in thought.
0:30:44|0:30:48|The warrior slowly regained consciousness.
0:31:34|0:31:44|Early the next morning, a cry was heard in the village as a group of people carried a stretcher and walked in.
0:31:59|0:32:10|[Shui Xiu] heard a sound and approached to investigate.
0:32:10|0:32:12|Upon hearing the man's words, [Shui Xiu] was overwhelmed with sadness.
0:32:14|0:32:19|On the other side, [Feng Yucheng]'s wife gathered all the women in the village together.
0:32:50|0:32:56|After speaking, [Feng Yucheng]'s wife led everyone to pick up hoes and headed to the slate factory.
0:32:56|0:33:4|The workers at the slate factory heard the noise and immediately stepped forward to stop the women.
0:33:4|0:33:6|The person in charge of the slate factory also hurried out.
0:33:9|0:33:11|Suddenly, [Shui Xiu] ran through the crowd.
0:33:11|0:33:13|[Shui Xiu] looked breathlessly at the impulsive crowd.
0:33:46|0:33:48|Meifeng listened with a pensive expression.
0:34:33|0:34:35|[Shui Xiu] finally smiled.
0:34:47|0:34:51|[Shui Xiu] looked helpless as she entered the village chief's office.
0:34:51|0:34:58|[Feng Laoqing] took a sip of tea, put down the teacup, and spoke to his daughter.
0:37:25|0:37:30|The first phase of their plan was successfully completed, and the girl happily ran out of Liu Yuhai's house.
0:37:35|0:37:39|In Shui Xiu's home, the girl carried the food and walked towards the small shop.
0:37:45|0:37:52|Come on, everyone was just about to start eating when Er Niuzi climbed up the low wall of [Shui Xiu]'s house.
0:38:41|0:38:46|[Feng Yucheng] was hurt by Erniuzi's words and drank one glass after another.
0:38:54|0:38:58|[Feng Yucheng] continued to drink silently without saying a word.
0:39:9|0:39:16|Come, night falls in the blink of an eye, and [Feng Yucheng] recalls what Erniu said, his mind racing and unable to fall asleep.
0:39:16|0:39:21|[Shui Xiu] lay on the side, quietly looking at his profile, full of heartache in his eyes.
0:39:30|0:39:35|On the side, [Shui Xiu] seemed to sense [Feng Yucheng]'s sadness and comforted him softly.
0:39:46|0:39:53|[Feng Yucheng] rested his head on his arm in silence, feeling deeply saddened by his own experiences.
0:40:2|0:40:5|His heart is filled with both resignation and unwillingness.
0:40:5|0:40:15|[Feng Yucheng] turned his head to look at [Shui Xiu], then squeezed towards [Shui Xiu], and the two of them hugged tightly together.
0:40:15|0:40:22|In the quiet night, [Feng Yucheng] suddenly sat up from the bed, sighing helplessly.
0:40:22|0:40:24|Shui Xiu watched Feng Laoqing with concern.
0:40:32|0:40:38|[Feng Yucheng] angrily held the bed with his hands, and [Shui Xiu] quickly calmed him down.
0:40:53|0:41:0|Later, under the comfort of [Shui Xiu], [Feng Yucheng] finally lay down slowly, and she carefully covered him with a blanket.
0:41:0|0:41:10|After Feng Yucheng fell asleep, Shui Xiu gently opened the door, carefully walked out of the room, and then quietly closed the door.
0:41:10|0:41:15|Shui Xiu remembered Feng Yucheng's ordeal and sadly turned and walked into the courtyard.
0:41:15|0:41:20|Under the moonlight, his sorrowful expression is filled with bitterness and grievances.
0:41:20|0:41:28|He walked slowly forward, reminiscing about past experiences, and as he looked up, he saw a person standing not far away. 
0:41:29|0:41:31|[Wu Zheng] slowly turned his head around.
0:41:32|0:41:37|[Shui Xiu] walked up to [Wu Zheng] and he looked at her in surprise.
0:41:53|0:41:59|[Shui Xiu] hugged her arms, took two steps forward with her head down, and then said sorrowfully.
0:41:59|0:42:18|Your heart is kind, but as the night wind blows, bringing a chill, [Wu Zheng] looks at [Shui Xiu] in thin clothing and quickly takes off his coat for her.
0:42:18|0:42:21|[Shui Xiu] took the coat and turned to look at [Wu Zheng].
0:42:52|0:42:56|[Shui Xiu] nodded and smiled after listening to [Wu Zheng]'s words.
0:43:13|0:43:18|After speaking, [Wu Zheng] turned around and went back into the house, leaving only [Shui Xiu] standing alone in the courtyard.
0:43:21|0:43:27|The next moment, he turned around and found [Feng Yucheng] standing at the door, staring at him intently.
0:43:27|0:43:34|Seeing [Shui Xiu] turn around, [Feng Laoqing] angrily slammed the door with his cane and then got up to return to his room.
0:43:34|0:43:42|Looking at his departing figure, [Shui Xiu] suddenly remembered that she was still wearing the coat of non-struggle, so she quickly took it off.
0:43:42|0:43:47|He looked down at the coat in his hand, then glanced uneasily at the door that had been slammed shut.
0:43:49|0:43:55|The next morning, [Shui Xiu] prepared breakfast early.
0:43:55|0:44:3|Seeing [Feng Yucheng] struggling to walk with a cane, [Shui Xiu] quickly approached and carefully helped him to sit at the table before continuing to set the tableware.
0:44:8|0:44:14|[Shui Xiu] saw that [Wu Zheng] didn't respond, so she turned around and looked at his room with a puzzled expression.
0:44:14|0:44:18|On ordinary days, [Wu Zheng] doesn't like to sleep in and will get up early.
0:44:18|0:44:21|[Shui Xiu] turned around and walked towards [Wu Zheng]'s door.
0:44:28|0:44:32|[Shui Xiu] knocked on the door again, but there was no response from [Wu Zheng]'s room.
0:44:32|0:44:41|[Shui Xiu] carefully pushed open the door and walked in. She looked around, finding no one inside. The room had been tidied up neatly by [Wu Zheng].
0:44:41|0:44:50|[Shui Xiu] looked around the empty room in confusion, staring at the neatly made bed, recalling the scenes of [Wu Zheng] in the room.
0:44:50|0:44:53|With a turn, Shui Xiu found another note left by Wu Zheng on the desk.
0:44:57|0:45:4|He walked to the desk and slowly picked up the note on the table, reading it carefully.
0:45:18|0:45:25|After reading the note left by [Wu Zheng], [Shui Xiu] seemed lost in thought, while on the other side, [Wu Zheng] had already driven back to the city.
0:45:25|0:45:31|It is unfortunate to make a woman as pure and kind as [Shui Xiu] bear the pressure that she should not bear.
0:45:43|0:45:46|The car sped across the bridge, on the other side,
0:46:2|0:46:5|Uncle Feng Laoqing handed the gift letter to Shui Xiu.
0:46:48|0:46:50|Er Niu said anxiously.
0:47:8|0:47:11|The two people looked at each other with furrowed brows.
0:47:11|0:47:14|Lou [Liu Yuhai] took a deep breath and came up with a solution.
0:47:14|0:47:15|Er Niu Zi asked in confusion.
0:48:13|0:48:17|Upon hearing the news, Shui Xiu immediately went out to inform the villagers.
0:48:17|0:48:24|[Liu Yuhai] angrily threw the notification document on the ground, muttering to himself in frustration.
0:48:24|0:48:30|In the afternoon, Meifeng arrived home.
0:49:5|0:49:16|[Shui Xiu] and the girl just returned home.
0:49:16|0:49:19|She walked up and greeted Meifeng generously.
0:49:19|0:49:23|Yu Cheng saw [Shui Xiu] and immediately turned back into the house in anger.
0:49:23|0:49:25|[Shui Xiu] turned around and said to Mei Feng.
0:49:28|0:49:30|[Shui Xiu]'s furrowed brow gradually relaxed.
0:49:39|0:49:41|Shui Xiu looked helpless after hearing it.
0:49:59|0:50:3|[Shui Xiu] took the project proposal from the girl with a strong turn.
0:50:33|0:50:40|After speaking, Meifeng left with a strong momentum, and the scene shifted to the election meeting in Yinghancun.
0:52:29|0:52:32|Meifeng sat below and gave Liu Yuhai a sideways glance.
0:52:36|0:52:40|The villagers were excited and clapped their hands when they heard they could make money.
0:52:44|0:52:47|When Shui Xiu started speaking, Er Niu deliberately squeezed next to the money sign.
0:54:56|0:54:59|After speaking, the two of them smiled at each other.
0:55:5|0:55:9|Liu Yuhai covered his neck with a towel and nodded at Er Niuzi.
0:55:31|0:55:34|Liu Yuhai nodded in satisfaction after listening.
0:55:34|0:55:42|Erniuzi saw the situation, smiled and squatted down, one hand resting on the sofa. He saw Shui Xiu staring at him and stood up happily.
0:55:42|0:55:43|Liu Yuhai looked up.
0:55:54|0:55:58|After speaking, he couldn't help but cough, and Er Niu was serving in the alliance.
0:56:28|0:56:39|[Shui Xiu] and Yao Yao arrived at the village chief's office. [Liu Yuhai] impatiently picked up a teacup, took a sip, and then put the proposal into the drawer.
0:56:40|0:56:42|Shui Xiu and Yao Yao looked at him in confusion.
0:56:59|0:57:4|As long as it can be promoted, Yao Yao from Yupeng also nodded.
0:57:24|0:57:25|Yao Yao shook her head, said [Liu Yuhai].
0:57:42|0:57:46|Liu Yuhai was shocked by Shui Xiu's words and stood up, turning around.
0:57:46|0:57:51|[Shui Xiu] angrily took Yang Yao's hand and decisively turned away.
0:57:51|0:57:55|Liu Yuhai watched the two figures walk away, humming a song with his hands behind his back.
0:58:2|0:58:6|[Shui Xiu] placed something wrapped in a newspaper on the table, as [Wu Zheng] looked on.
0:58:11|0:58:15|[Yao Yao] stared with wide eyes at [Wu Zheng], then at [Shui Xiu].
0:58:29|0:58:33|[Yao Yao] and [Shui Xiu] exchanged a smile, with [Shui Xiu] saying.
0:58:39|0:58:41|[Wu Zheng] nodded with a smile.
0:58:42|0:58:46|Shui Xiu and Yao Yao found Liu Yuhai with the money.
0:58:46|0:58:50|Liu Yuhai put down the money and walked to the two of them with a smile.
0:58:51|0:58:53|He nodded at [Shui Xiu].
0:58:54|0:58:55|Yao Yao replied to this.
1:0:17|1:0:19|Shui Xiu finally smiled.
1:0:20|1:0:22|Erniuzi suddenly spoke up.
1:0:39|1:0:42|Erniuzi happily jumped off the chair.
1:0:59|1:1:1|[Yao Yao] walked towards the crowd with a file in hand.
1:1:20|1:1:22|At this moment, Er Niuzi spoke again.
1:1:31|1:1:34|[Shui Xiu]'s high emotional intelligence answer made everyone laugh.
1:1:34|1:1:37|A few days later, [Shui Xiu] opened a restaurant at home.
1:1:37|1:1:41|Er Niu stood on a ladder to help hang the signboard, taking unauthorized photos to document the scene.
1:1:41|1:1:47|Upon seeing the restaurant open, [Shui Xiu] looked at everyone and joyfully exclaimed.
1:1:54|1:1:59|Firecrackers sounded, Sun Ming and the tourists rushed into the courtyard one after another.
1:1:59|1:2:3|The small courtyard of [Shui Xiu]'s home was crowded with people, creating a lively scene.
1:2:3|1:2:8|[Yao Yao] and Er Niuzi were busy serving dishes to the guests, shuttling back and forth in the courtyard.
1:2:8|1:2:14|[Feng Yucheng] sat on the chair, seeing the lively scene in front of him, feeling both gratified and happy, couldn't help but exclaim in surprise.
1:2:25|1:2:38|After a while, the tourists finished eating and left one after another. [Shui Xiu] and Yao Yao warmly bid farewell to everyone.
1:2:43|1:2:48|The tourists dispersed, and [Shui Xiu] smiled.
1:2:48|1:2:53|Er Niu helped move a chair for [Feng Yucheng] in the Lotus Gang.
1:2:53|1:3:0|Yao Yao carefully calculated the accounts, while Shui Xiu and the others looked on with anticipation.
1:3:14|1:3:21|Suddenly, the voice of Meifeng came, holding a chicken and leading a group of people.
1:3:38|1:3:59|On the other side, [Liu Yuhai]'s slate factory only has a few workers.
1:3:59|1:4:2|Shan Tao is carefully counting the number of slate stones.
1:4:2|1:4:5|[Liu Yuhai] looked around at the slate factory and walked up to Shui Xiu's side at Shantao Mountain, saying.
1:4:10|1:4:12|Shan Tao sighed.
1:4:21|1:4:24|[Liu Yuhai] was so angry that he didn't know what to say for a moment.
1:4:25|1:4:25|Shan Tao quickly comforted [Shui Xiu].
1:4:45|1:4:46|[Liu Yuhai] was stunned for a moment.
1:4:47|1:4:47|Then she furrowed her brows and shook her head.
1:5:6|1:5:10|Glancing at the workers in front of them, [Shui Xiu] and [Feng Laoqing] both sighed at the same time.
1:5:29|1:5:36|At this moment, Er Niu arrived at the slate factory, and Shui Xiu gave a fierce look.
1:5:38|1:5:42|Erniu walked up to [Liu Yuhai], who warmly grabbed his hand.
1:6:27|1:6:29|Liu Yuhai pulled Er Niu Zi over.
1:6:50|1:6:57|[Liu Yuhai] immediately stood up and leaned in, [Liu Yuhai] sighed and thought with his eyes.
1:7:25|1:7:32|He turned around and saw [Niu Jieshi] pointing at the office.
1:7:32|1:7:43|On the other side, [Feng Yucheng] came to [Wu Zheng]'s room, leaning on a cane and wiping the coffee table. Then he turned around and slowly walked towards the desk, helping him tidy up the table, which was cluttered with many books of [Wu Zheng].
1:7:45|1:7:53|He picked up the books on the table, neatly arranged them one by one, and then carefully wiped the entire desk with a cloth.
1:7:53|1:7:57|Then, [Feng Yucheng] came to the bedside with a cane, struggling.
1:7:57|1:8:2|He fumbled like a crutch, with one hand free to tidy up the clothes on the bed.
1:8:3|1:8:15|He picked up the clothes that [Wu Zheng] had thrown around one by one, neatly placed them on the pillow. When he was about to pick up the last piece of clothing, many photos suddenly fell out from it.
1:8:15|1:8:22|He curiously picked up the scattered photos on the bed, and upon closer inspection, he found that the protagonist in the photo was none other than his wife, [Shui Xiu].
1:8:23|1:8:30|[Feng Yucheng] flipped through the photos one by one, recalling the rumors in the village, and angrily threw the photos away.
1:8:30|1:8:37|The next day, [Feng Yucheng] leaned against a big tree, watching [Shui Xiu], while Er Niu greeted the tourists warmly.
1:8:44|1:8:51|Er Niu Jieshi saw Feng Yucheng leaning against a tree, feeling suspicious in his heart. He walked up with a sly smile, approached Feng Yucheng and said.
1:9:24|1:9:27|Help [Feng Yucheng] realize his dream of starting a tourism business.
1:9:29|1:9:33|Liu Yuhai's smile gradually stiffened, and his face also became ugly.
1:9:33|1:9:36|Er Niu Zi continued to embellish the story.
1:10:1|1:10:5|[Feng Yucheng] couldn't bear it anymore, he picked up the pipe and was about to hit Er Niuzi.
1:10:5|1:10:13|Even though I didn't say anything, Er Niu still ran off without looking back, and in the evening, [Shui Xiu] brought the meal into the house.
1:10:33|1:10:34|Shui Xiu looks at Feng Laoqing.
1:11:4|1:11:6|[Shui Xiu] stands up angrily.
1:11:16|1:11:22|[Feng Yucheng] raised his hand and slapped [Shui Xiu], who looked at him in shock before turning and running out of the house.
1:11:24|1:11:33|[Feng Yucheng] watched as [Shui Xiu] walked away, unable to contain his anger any longer. He angrily swept all the food on the table to the floor and knocked over the chair.
1:11:33|1:11:44|He gasped heavily, his eyes fixed on the photo of Shui Xiu and Feng Laoqing hanging on the wall. He grabbed the glass on the table and fiercely threw it towards the photo, shattering the glass outside the photo.
1:11:47|1:11:49|[Feng Yucheng] roared angrily.
1:11:49|1:11:56|On the other side, [Shui Xiu] kept running along the path, the night was dark, but her footsteps never stopped.
1:11:56|1:12:2|[Shui Xiu] ran down the stairs and arrived at a stone door, leaning against the wall, panting heavily.
1:12:2|1:12:9|Her eyes were vacant, leaning against the wall, lost in thought as she recalled the experience just now.
1:12:9|1:12:16|She raised her hand and touched her face, which had just been slapped by [Feng Yucheng], her mind in turmoil, tears constantly swirling in her eyes.
1:12:17|1:12:24|In the end, she couldn't help but burst into tears, feeling very wronged in the face of Feng Yucheng's misunderstanding and the rumors in the village.
1:12:31|1:12:35|He leaned on a cane and clumsily bumped into the door frame.
1:12:35|1:12:39|After making numerous adjustments, [Shui Xiu] finally managed to walk out of the house with great difficulty.
1:12:39|1:12:43|He carefully walked down the steps and quickly crossed the yard.
1:12:43|1:12:46|Then, shouting as she went, [Shui Xiu] walked to the front gate.
1:12:46|1:12:51|The stone steps at the entrance were very steep, and he could only slowly descend the stairs with the help of a cane.
1:12:51|1:12:53|But his heart was filled with anxiety.
1:12:53|1:13:1|[Feng Yucheng] walked out of the house, shouting loudly. He arrived at the place where [Shui Xiu] had just run past, but did not see [Shui Xiu]'s figure.
1:13:3|1:13:8|He stopped in his tracks, anxiously looking ahead.
1:13:8|1:13:13|But no matter how he called, he couldn't get a response from [Shui Xiu].
1:13:13|1:13:17|Next, [Feng Yucheng] turned around and walked towards a downhill road.
1:13:17|1:13:21|The uneven stone path was exceptionally difficult for him.
1:13:24|1:13:28|Without paying attention, [Shui Xiu] slipped and fell heavily to the ground.
1:13:32|1:13:49|He sat on the ground looking around, then he picked up a crutch from the ground, and picked up another one next to him, put the two under his arms together, trying hard to stand up, but failed several times.
1:13:49|1:13:56|[Feng Yucheng] struggled to stand up with the support of a cane, using his arms to prop up his body unsteadily.
1:13:56|1:14:0|He walked towards the steps with a cane, and the steps were very steep.
1:14:0|1:14:4|Feng Laoqing's cane slipped, and he rolled down the steps directly.
1:14:5|1:14:12|On the other side, [Shui Xiu] heard [Feng Yucheng]'s shout and quickly turned around to run over, heading swiftly towards her home.
1:14:12|1:14:20|In the dim light of the night, she swiftly navigated through the narrow alleyways, rushing into the courtyard with quick steps, searching for the figure of [Feng Yucheng] inside the house.
1:14:22|1:14:30|[Shui Xiu] was stunned as soon as she entered the room, seeing broken tableware scattered all over the floor, creating a chaotic scene.
1:14:30|1:14:35|She looked at the broken photo hanging on the wall, stunned.
1:14:35|1:14:40|Shui Xiu's eyes were filled with sadness, tears kept rolling in her eyes.
1:14:40|1:14:44|She thought for a moment, then immediately turned around and rushed into the courtyard to look for [Feng Yucheng].
1:14:44|1:14:47|She looked around the courtyard and shouted loudly.
1:14:50|1:14:53|[Shui Xiu] searched everywhere in the house but couldn't find [Feng Yucheng].
1:14:53|1:14:56|Coincidentally, at the door, [Wu Zheng] meets [Shui Xiu] who has just returned home.
1:15:9|1:15:10|The two of them ran all the way, searching for [Feng Yucheng].
1:15:19|1:15:21|They arrived at the stone path that [Feng Yucheng] had just walked on.
1:15:29|1:15:34|At the bottom of the stairs, [Shui Xiu] found a cane.
1:15:34|1:15:39|She hurried forward to pick it up, recognizing at a glance that it was [Feng Yucheng]'s cane.
1:15:39|1:15:43|Looking ahead, [Feng Yucheng] was found lying on the ground.
1:15:43|1:15:51|[Wu Zheng] hurriedly carried [Feng Yucheng] to the hospital.
1:15:51|1:15:54|In the office, [Liu Yuhai] patted Er Niu Zi's shoulder and said.
1:15:58|1:16:6|Er Niu Zi showed a flattering smile, [Liu Yuhai] turned around and approached him, saying.
1:16:13|1:16:17|At the hospital, [Shui Xiu] fell asleep on [Feng Laoqing]'s hospital bed.
1:16:17|1:16:21|[Feng Yucheng] woke up and gently stroked [Shui Xiu]'s hair with his hand.
1:16:21|1:16:23|[Shui Xiu] opened her eyes and immediately covered [Feng Yucheng] with a blanket.
1:16:27|1:16:31|[Feng Yucheng] let out a long sigh and said.
1:16:31|1:16:40|[Shui Xiu], after speaking, turned her face away in despair.
1:16:55|1:16:59|[Feng Yucheng] turned to [Shui Xiu] and said.
1:17:39|1:17:43|After speaking, [Feng Yucheng] started crying sadly, and [Shui Xiu] helplessly said.
1:18:2|1:18:6|[Feng Yucheng] turned his head and looked at [Shui Xiu], letting out a long sigh.
1:18:30|1:18:45|He tightly held [Shui Xiu]'s hand and sighed.
1:18:45|1:18:47|Tears started flowing uncontrollably as she spoke.
1:19:10|1:19:21|[Shui Xiu] finished speaking, then gently wrapped her arms around [Feng Yucheng], resting her head against his chest.
1:19:37|1:19:42|[Feng Yucheng] cried sadly after listening to [Shui Xiu]'s words.
1:19:42|1:19:46|In the village chief's office, [Liu Yuhai] gathered the villagers together.
1:20:4|1:20:7|Yao Yao stood up angrily after listening, saying.
1:20:14|1:20:15|Liu Yuhai angrily widened his eyes.
1:20:26|1:20:30|Shui Xiu and Feng Laoqing looked at each other angrily.
1:20:47|1:20:52|[Yao Yao] listened, gave her a sidelong glance, and then shifted her gaze elsewhere.
1:20:52|1:20:58|Then, [Liu Yuhai] turned around, sat on the chair, and said.
1:21:17|1:21:20|Yang Yao looked at him and couldn't help but sneer.
1:21:35|1:21:39|The next day, several buses stopped at the entrance of Yingkan Village.
1:22:2|1:22:7|[Shui Xiu] gathers the villagers together, and everyone joyfully welcomes the arrival of Minister Yang.
1:22:7|1:22:11|The village of Yingtan is filled with the lively sounds of drums and gongs.
1:23:53|1:23:57|The leader and tourists are all enjoying the beautiful scenery in Yingtan Village.
1:23:57|1:24:1|A few days later, [Shui Xiu] and [Yao Yao] saw [Wu Zheng] off.
1:24:23|1:24:29|[Shui Xiu] smiled and responded to [Wu Zheng]'s words.
1:24:33|1:24:44|[Wu Zheng] waved goodbye to [Yao Yao], then she turned and walked to the car, opened the door, but instead of getting in right away, she turned her head and looked at [Shui Xiu].
1:24:44|1:24:51|[Yao Yao] saw [Wu Zheng] turn around and waved enthusiastically, while [Shui Xiu] stood aside, lowering her head sadly.
1:24:51|1:24:58|[Wu Zheng] looked at [Shui Xiu] and smiled, then turned around and got into the car. With a bang, as if hitting [Shui Xiu]'s heart.
1:24:58|1:25:5|His eyes filled with tears, staring fixedly at the car of [Wu Zheng], as [Wu Zheng] stepped on the gas and drove away.
1:25:5|1:25:15|Yao Yao was still happily waving towards the direction Wu Zheng left, she turned her head to look at Shui Xiu, only to see Shui Xiu frowning with a deeply saddened expression.
1:25:15|1:25:17|On the other side, Wu Zheng's car drove over the stone bridge.
1:25:44|1:25:48|The unlicensed car turned on the bridge and gradually disappeared into the distance.
1:25:48|1:25:52|In the morning, [Shui Xiu] is helping [Feng Laoqing] walk on the stone path.
1:25:52|1:25:57|[Shui Xiu] was seen supporting his other arm as he leaned on a cane.
1:25:57|1:26:0|Every step he took was exceptionally difficult. 
1:26:0|1:26:2|He hadn't walked far before he started panting heavily.
1:26:12|1:26:17|Shui Xiu and Feng Laoqing frowned upon hearing it, and the leaders gathered in the government office for a meeting.
1:26:20|1:26:30|The illegal use of explosives in the quarry, tearing open the colored stones, led to casualties and triggered a more serious mass incident.
1:26:33|1:26:38|A comprehensive safety inspection of all the colored stone factories in the county was simultaneously conducted.
1:27:6|1:27:11|On the other side, the dining table at [Shui Xiu]'s home was filled with tempting dishes.
1:27:15|1:27:17|Upon entering the room, Shui Xiu was shocked by the delicious food in front of her.
1:27:44|1:27:52|[Feng Yucheng] didn't want [Shui Xiu] to support him. The two exchanged smiles, and [Shui Xiu] shed tears of excitement.
1:28:0|1:28:4|[Shui Xiu] laughed happily, tears of emotion hanging on her cheeks.
1:28:4|1:28:7|Later, [Yao Yao] and Er Niu became tour guides in Yingtan Village.
1:29:7|1:29:21|A familiar voice, familiar words came from behind [Shui Xiu], and the person in front of her revealed a big smile.
