0:2:26|0:2:47|In the luxury mansion, [Mr. Fan] leaned back on the bed, holding the remote control and pressing a button by the window. The curtains slowly opened, and he shook a bell from the bedside, prompting his female secretary to enter.
0:3:3|0:3:13|The secretary led the way, with [Mr. Fan] leisurely following behind, tying his bathrobe belt as they walked through the luxurious reception hall and corridors to the dining room.
0:3:13|0:3:18|The secretary made a brief introduction.
0:3:40|0:3:49|Mr. Fan walked to the front of the restaurant and cracked open an egg.
0:3:52|0:3:58|The secretary quickly stepped forward to pull out a chair for [Qin Fen], while [Mr. Fan] peeled an egg and spoke.
0:4:46|0:4:59|Mr. Fan, who was attracted, wiped his hands and listened carefully. Mr. Fan tried to change his hand position himself.
0:5:1|0:5:19|[Qin Fen] stood up and picked up the safe, placing it on the table. He took out a blue cylindrical container with a hollow middle and two handles.
0:5:43|0:5:54|Both of them put their hands into the tube at both ends and conducted an experiment.
0:5:59|0:6:9|[Qin Fen] finished speaking and looked at the secretary in the corner, who also looked at [Qin Fen] and clapped while biting her lip.
0:7:11|0:7:23|[Qin Fen] received the 2 million pounds and went to a caf√©, editing his dating profile on a website.
0:9:30|0:9:42|After Qin Fen's marriage proposal was posted online, he arranged to meet the first applicant at a high-end restaurant.
0:9:42|0:9:47|[Qin Fen] had been waiting on the second floor of the restaurant for this blind date.
0:9:48|0:9:56|The scene follows a short-haired woman dressed in a fashionable and sexy manner entering a high-end restaurant.
0:9:56|0:10:7|The restaurant is quiet, elegant, spacious, and bright, not tacky. The waiters are meticulous in their work. The short-haired woman is standing in front of a mirror on the first floor.
0:10:7|0:10:17|After taking a quick look and tidying up her hair, [Liang Xiaoxiao] walked up to the second floor. The waiter in the corridor of the second floor also warmly welcomed her.
0:10:18|0:10:36|The woman also nodded politely in response. [Qin Fen], who had been waiting on the second floor, never took his eyes off her when he saw her. He thought she was Jasmine, the blind date partner for today. As the woman passed by [Qin Fen], she greeted the people at the table behind him.
0:10:37|0:10:45|Qin Fen only looked away when the short-haired woman sat down. Qin Fen returned to his designated seat with a slight sense of regret.
0:10:46|0:10:50|Periodically, his gaze also turned to the first floor.
0:10:50|0:11:0|[Qin Fen] sat back down at his seat. At this moment, a man wearing sunglasses and a tight T-shirt also sat down.
0:11:24|0:11:31|[Qin Jianguo] took off the women's sunglasses and placed them on the table, [Qin Fen] stood up and shook hands with [Jianguo].
0:11:59|0:12:5|Qin Fen leaned back and looked at Jianguo with a puzzled expression.
0:12:24|0:12:27|Jianguo shyly glanced at [Qin Fen].
0:12:30|0:12:40|Qin Fen looked at him thoughtfully as Jianguo pointed to him.
0:13:20|0:13:31|[Qin Fen] quickly interrupted Jianguo's words and said after some thought,
0:14:42|0:14:50|Jianguo grinned and called out "brother" without a smile, and [Qin Fen] responded straightforwardly.
0:14:56|0:15:2|[Qin Fen] and the second applicant arranged to meet at a picturesque park for their blind date.
0:15:2|0:15:7|The second applicant is a pretty girl in a black short-sleeved shirt.
0:17:24|0:17:38|[Qin Fen] stared at the girl who was earnestly selling cemetery plots without saying a word. The girl stared back with her big round eyes and nodded at [Qin Fen]. When [Qin Fen] snapped out of it, he turned around and left first.
0:17:38|0:17:54|The third location is a high-end coffee shop, where a woman in a white shirt and black skirt, with outstanding looks, sits by the window, feeling low and expressionless, waiting for [Qin Fen].
0:17:55|0:18:6|After looking around for a moment, [Qin Fen] slowly walked towards the window. Taking off his sunglasses, [Qin Fen] asked,
0:18:19|0:18:27|After sitting down, [Qin Fen] politely smiled at [Liang Xiaoxiao], and [Qin Fen] looked [Liang Xiaoxiao] up and down.
0:18:29|0:18:40|[Liang Xiaoxiao] looked uneasily towards the window, then smiled at [Qin Fen]. [Qin Fen], captivated by her beauty, was speechless for a while.
0:18:56|0:19:26|[Qin Fen] nodded, stood up and placed the backpack he was carrying aside. He then sat upright in the middle of the sofa, looking at [Liang Xiaoxiao] with a smile on her face, and asked. [Liang Xiaoxiao] pondered for a moment, lowered her head and remained silent.
0:20:11|0:20:17|[Liang Xiaoxiao] smiled and then quickly regained control.
0:20:24|0:20:35|Qin Fen leaned back on the sofa smugly.
0:22:1|0:22:7|With that, [Qin Fen] picked up his bag and stood up, ready to leave.
0:22:48|0:22:55|[Qin Fen] walked out of the coffee shop, followed by [Liang Xiaoxiao].
0:23:22|0:23:43|After that, the two of them arrived at a quiet bar. In the bar, they ordered some food and a bottle of white wine. [Liang Xiaoxiao] raised her glass to signal [Qin Fen] to drink. Seeing [Qin Fen] raise his glass, [Liang Xiaoxiao] drank it all in one gulp. When [Qin Fen] only took a small sip and put down the glass, [Liang Xiaoxiao] noticed.
0:23:43|0:23:46|Liang Xiaoxiao looked disappointed and said,
0:24:38|0:24:47|The two fell silent for a moment, each lost in their own thoughts.
0:25:32|0:25:39|After Qin Fen finished speaking, he leaned back and looked at Liang Xiaoxiao. Liang Xiaoxiao took a deep breath, lowered her head, and smiled, saying,
0:25:58|0:26:9|Understanding Qin Fen stepped forward and looked at Liang Xiaoxiao, saying,
0:26:18|0:26:37|Tears welled up in [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s eyes, but did not fall. [Liang Xiaoxiao] sighed and said, then after a few drinks, she spoke candidly,
0:27:21|0:27:25|[Qin Fen] leaned back in his chair and watched [Liang Xiaoxiao] sigh helplessly.
0:27:50|0:28:6|[Qin Fen] stared blankly at [Liang Xiaoxiao], then went to the restroom. He washed his hands in the restroom, sighed in front of the mirror, dried his hands, and returned to his seat.
0:28:6|0:28:15|Looking at the already dizzy [Liang Xiaoxiao], she asked,
0:28:19|0:28:25|[Qin Fen] takes off his hat, raises the glass on the table and drinks it all in one gulp, then refills the glasses for the other two.
0:28:29|0:28:39|[Liang Xiaoxiao] looked at [Qin Fen] pouring wine, her face lit up again.
0:30:52|0:31:9|[Liang Xiaoxiao] picked up the wine glass and took a sip, disdainfully asking, then [Liang Xiaoxiao] finished the rest in one gulp. [Qin Fen] solemnly picked up the wine glass and poured himself another full glass.
0:31:53|0:32:36|[Qin Fen] eyes reddened, choked up with words at the corner of his mouth that he couldn't say, emotions gradually out of control, lips trembling slightly, hands covering his face sobbing.
0:33:58|0:34:5|After speaking, he raised his glass again, filled it with wine, and drank it all in one gulp.
0:34:11|0:34:22|Liang Xiaoxiao looked straight at him without saying a word.
0:34:28|0:34:44|[Liang Xiaoxiao] watched as [Qin Fen] paused for a moment before getting up and leaving, leaving [Qin Fen] alone sitting at the table.
0:34:45|0:34:51|After some time, [Qin Fen] embarked on his matchmaking journey again.
0:34:57|0:35:7|A girl in Miao costume nodded, shaking the silver ornaments on her head. [Qin Fen] played badminton while reminiscing about his blind date process.
0:35:15|0:35:22|[Qin Fen] glanced at the woman who was taking notes, then he and another woman played badminton in the gym.
0:36:33|0:36:46|After several failed blind dates, [Qin Fen] flew to Hainan to relax with a friend. The friend drove to the airport and picked up [Qin Fen].
0:37:15|0:37:32|[Qin Fen] met the woman introduced by his friend during the vacation. He looked at her somewhat puzzled.
0:37:56|0:38:5|[Qin Fen] furrowed his brow and pondered for a moment before saying,
0:39:54|0:40:16|[Qin Fen] looked at her expectantly, only to see the woman slowly extend a finger. [Qin Fen] lowered his head in disappointment, covering his face. The woman bent down and said to [Qin Fen],
0:40:34|0:40:44|[Qin Fen] looked at the scenery with a helpless expression, while the woman leaned back in her chair, looking puzzled and disheartened, asking,
0:40:47|0:40:55|Both of them rested their chins on their hands and turned their heads in different directions.
0:40:55|0:41:4|No more words were spoken. [Qin Fen] ended his blind date in Hainan in failure, and after the trip to Hainan, he rushed to the airport to go back.
0:41:4|0:41:19|While smoking outside the station, Qin Fen overheard a middle-aged man next to him making a phone call. Upon hearing Liang Xiaoxiao's name, Qin Fen turned around and listened for a few sentences.
0:42:0|0:42:39|[Liang Xiaoxiao] angrily hung up the phone with her lover Wang Xin, tightly gripping her phone. After calming down, [Liang Xiaoxiao] walked towards the cabin, where she greeted passengers at the door as usual. At that moment, [Qin Fen] took off his sunglasses, looked down at [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s name tag, but she didn't respond.
0:43:0|0:43:33|At work, [Liang Xiaoxiao] looked at him without saying a word, and Wang Xin reluctantly walked to his seat. Coincidentally, Wang Xin's wife and [Qin Fen] were sitting together. [Qin Fen] enthusiastically helped Mrs. Wang put away her luggage, while Wang Xin sat in another row. At this moment, [Liang Xiaoxiao] was organizing the luggage compartment in the aisle. Wang Xin watched [Liang Xiaoxiao] pass by without acknowledging him, so he prepared to close his eyes and rest.
0:43:33|0:43:41|Liang Xiaoxiao came to Mrs. Wang while performing cabin service.
0:44:30|0:44:41|Madam Wang nodded in agreement, while the lover looked at [Qin Fen] with a puzzled expression and asked,
0:44:57|0:45:4|Wang Xin glanced at [Qin Fen], stood up helplessly and walked to his wife's side, Mrs. Wang also stood up and thanked [Qin Fen].
0:45:20|0:45:36|The plane slowly takes off, [Liang Xiaoxiao] sits low-spirited in her seat, while [Qin Fen] sitting across notices that [Liang Xiaoxiao] hasn't fastened her seatbelt. He presses the call button, and when [Liang Xiaoxiao] sees the light on, she walks over to [Qin Fen].
0:45:49|0:46:7|[Liang Xiaoxiao] said nothing, turned and walked towards her seat, fastened her seatbelt, then glanced at [Qin Fen]. Seeing [Qin Fen] chin in hand, smiling at her, she rolled her eyes and turned her head away.
0:46:14|0:46:20|Married Man's Wife is reading a book in the cabin, while Married Man next to her is wearing an eye mask and turned his head to the other side, falling asleep.
0:46:23|0:46:46|[Qin Fen] said to [Liang Xiaoxiao] in the operating room, but [Liang Xiaoxiao], who was absent-mindedly preparing drinks, did not pay attention to him. After finishing, she continued to work at the operating table without saying anything extra to [Qin Fen]. Seeing this, [Qin Fen] walked over slowly and said,
0:46:55|0:47:3|After speaking, [Qin Fen] went back to his seat. [Liang Xiaoxiao] remained focused on her work, ignoring him the whole time.
0:47:3|0:47:9|After he left, [Liang Xiaoxiao] lowered her head in contemplation. In the blink of an eye, they arrived at the picturesque West Lake in Hangzhou.
0:47:10|0:47:16|[Qin Fen] is on a boat on the lake, with a young girl next to him explaining the history.
0:50:10|0:50:23|Liang Xiaoxiao took a car to the teahouse, where a man and a woman were performing Suzhou Pingtan with a pipa and erhu.
0:50:29|0:50:39|At this moment, [Liang Xiaoxiao] walked past the two of them and entered the teahouse. The teahouse was bustling with activity, with groups of three to five people at each table, leisurely enjoying tea and chatting.
0:50:39|0:50:46|[Liang Xiaoxiao] wandered around before finally finding [Qin Fen] who was on a blind date, she casually sat at an empty table.
0:51:18|0:51:25|Qin Fen couldn't help but smile and waved his hand.
0:52:44|0:52:49|After listening to the Taiwanese girl excitedly grabbing [Qin Fen]'s hand,
0:53:46|0:53:51|[Qin Fen] avoided the girl's gaze and leaned back in his chair.
0:54:42|0:54:50|The girl looked pitiful and aggrieved, lowered her head and looked to the side without saying a word.
0:55:1|0:55:21|[Liang Xiaoxiao] frowned and watched the two of them, the Taiwanese girl got up and left the teahouse in disappointment. [Liang Xiaoxiao] sitting at another table finished watching and then walked over with her tea.
0:56:9|0:56:27|Xiaoxiao wanted to argue but couldn't find the words. Qin Fen glanced at her and then said,
0:57:13|0:57:18|Liang Xiaoxiao stood up and walked out of the teahouse.
0:57:18|0:57:24|Although Qin Fen said he wouldn't go, he eventually compromised.
0:57:24|0:57:29|They walked towards Wang Xin's club, one in front and one behind.
0:57:29|0:57:43|In the clubhouse, the tea artist meticulously brewed tea according to the craft, while Wang Xin drank tea expressionlessly and silently.
0:57:43|0:58:16|Wang Xingang picked up the cup to drink, only to see [Liang Xiaoxiao] and another person walking over. [Liang Xiaoxiao] sat down in front of Wang Xin at a small square table, with [Qin Fen] sitting on his right. The tea artist smiled and nodded before walking out.
0:59:32|0:59:41|Wang Xin stared at [Liang Xiaoxiao] without blinking.
0:59:46|0:59:54|Wang Xin's face was solemn, with his head down as if he was contemplating something.
0:59:58|1:0:9|[Qin Fen] turned around, sat down and listened attentively. [Qin Fen] nodded earnestly.
1:0:34|1:0:38|[Liang Xiaoxiao] lowered her head, and none of the three spoke.
1:0:40|1:0:47|Qin Fen hesitated for a moment and said,
1:0:51|1:1:7|He finished speaking and stood up to leave, but was stopped by [Qin Fen] when Wang Xin tried to get up.
1:1:9|1:1:17|After Qin Fen finished speaking, he turned and left. Liang Xiaoxiao looked aggrieved and angry as she glanced at Wang Xin.
1:1:18|1:1:38|Seeing Wang Xin remained silent, Qin Fen stood up and poured himself a glass of wine at the liquor cabinet. Liang Xiaoxiao stood in front of the liquor cabinet with her back to Wang Xin. Wang Xin looked at her, then turned around and lowered his head without saying a word.
1:1:55|1:2:35|Wang Xin stood up and snatched the wine from [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s hand. He pulled [Liang Xiaoxiao] over and grabbed the wine glass from her hand. [Liang Xiaoxiao] got angry and tried to hit Wang Xin. Wang Xin tried to hug [Liang Xiaoxiao], but she resisted fiercely and pushed him away. After being pushed, Wang Xin calmed down, while [Liang Xiaoxiao] angrily beat him. Wang Xin lowered his head and let her vent. [Liang Xiaoxiao] cried in anger, but Wang Xin remained silent with his head down.
1:2:35|1:2:38|The sky darkens as the two of them cuddle in the small boat.
1:2:39|1:2:47|The boat was slowly sailing on West Lake, with the setting sun blending the lake, sky, trees, and water into one.
1:3:2|1:3:8|Wang Xin held [Liang Xiaoxiao] in his arms, but remained silent.
1:3:51|1:4:16|During a break, [Qin Fen], who was wiping sweat, received a text message. He put down the towel, opened his phone, and saw that the message was from Xiaoxiao. The message read, and then [Qin Fen] called Xiaoxiao back and left a message.
1:4:43|1:4:50|The next day, [Qin Fen] arrived at a small pavilion by the lake and began his blind date journey.
1:6:58|1:7:16|[Qin Fen] turned around to look for [Liang Xiaoxiao], the blind date woman also looked at her. [Qin Fen] hung up the phone, took off his sunglasses and self-deprecatingly said,
1:7:44|1:7:51|After speaking, the two stood up and shook hands politely.
1:7:55|1:8:8|Blind date over, [Qin Fen] came to the small pub where [Liang Xiaoxiao] was also present. [Qin Fen] stood at the door watching [Liang Xiaoxiao] lost in thought while drinking, then walked over and tapped her. [Liang Xiaoxiao] snapped out of it and looked at [Qin Fen].
1:8:38|1:8:53|[Liang Xiaoxiao] looked at him seriously, [Qin Fen] finished the watermelon and looked at her with confusion. The two of them remained silent for a while, and then [Qin Fen] wiped his hands and said,
1:10:51|1:11:19|Two people met and smiled at each other, then they took the same car to Hokkaido. At a remote seaside in Hokkaido, the train carrying [Qin Fen] and [Liang Xiaoxiao] slowly pulled into the station. The train stopped at the sparsely populated station, and after it came to a halt, the two of them got off with their luggage. [Qin Fen]'s old friend [Wu Sang] was already waiting for them on the platform, and he walked up to them as they got off.
1:11:25|1:11:32|After embracing each other, [Qin Fen] looked at [Wu Sang] intently.
1:11:52|1:12:6|[Wu Sang] took the suitcase and the three of them walked towards the car. They drove along the rural roads of Hokkaido.
1:12:6|1:12:24|Scenes of the landscape outside the window reflected on Liang Xiaoxiao's face as she half-opened the car window and gazed absentmindedly outside.
1:12:31|1:12:41|[Qin Fen] didn't hear a response for half a day, so he turned around and woke her up.
1:13:29|1:13:52|The car stopped at the temple gate, [Qin Fen] got out. After speaking, [Qin Fen] walked towards the temple, followed by [Wu Sang] driving the car.
1:14:2|1:14:10|Wu Sang approached after finishing the conversation with the monk in the temple and said,
1:14:50|1:14:54|After speaking, [Wu Sang] walked towards the temple.
1:15:3|1:15:11|After persuading the monk, the three of them arrived at the entrance of the hall, took off their shoes, and then opened the door to go in.
1:15:14|1:15:21|At the entrance, a Japanese person in a kimono conducted a body search on them.
1:15:34|1:15:50|In the hall, the monks are chanting, and dozens of Japanese people in kimonos are kneeling neatly below. [Qin Fen] and two others are kneeling at the back. [Qin Fen] keeps looking around at the bodyguards on the side, and the bodyguards are also watching him.
1:15:58|1:16:6|After the worship, the three of them left.
1:16:7|1:16:17|In the car, [Wu Sang] said to [Qin Fen],
1:16:55|1:17:0|Qin Fen turned around and grabbed her hand.
1:17:2|1:17:16|[Liang Xiaoxiao] smiled and pushed his hand away. The car drove along the winding road.
1:17:16|1:17:34|As they drove into the city, the sky darkened and it started to rain. Not knowing the way, [Wu Sang] got off the car to ask a passerby for the location of the hotel.
1:17:44|1:18:4|On the lightbox are four beautiful young women in kimonos, and the group drives towards the hotel after finding the way.
1:18:9|1:18:22|The car stopped at the entrance of the hotel, and three people got out one after another. [Qin Fen] and [Wu Sang] whispered to each other as they took their luggage from the trunk.
1:18:44|1:18:57|Pack up the luggage, settle in a picturesque and spacious hotel room, the attendant leaves after placing clothes in [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s room.
1:19:5|1:19:26|A person in the room, [Liang Xiaoxiao], looked at the sea outside the window, not only reminding her of the time spent with Wang Xin in Hokkaido, but also immersing herself in deep memories, flashing happy moments with Wang Xin in Hokkaido in her mind.
1:19:26|1:19:50|During dinner, Wu Sang cracked a raw egg into the rice, mixed it with caviar, and handed it to Qin Fen. Qin Fen scooped up a spoonful and put it in his mouth, then grimaced at Wu Sang and said,
1:21:36|1:21:44|[Qin Fen] put down his chopsticks and hugged [Liang Xiaoxiao], whispering in her ear,
1:22:11|1:22:20|Liang Xiaoxiao angrily pushed him away, Qin Fen and Liang Xiaoxiao locked eyes for a moment before glancing at Wu Sang, then turned to Liang Xiaoxiao and said,
1:22:50|1:23:23|After listening, [Liang Xiaoxiao] angrily walked out of the restaurant. [Qin Fen] stopped [Wu Sang] who was about to follow, clinked glasses, saw [Liang Xiaoxiao] come back and stand at the door looking at [Qin Fen]. [Qin Fen] waved at [Liang Xiaoxiao] to come over. [Liang Xiaoxiao] walked over, but did not sit down. Instead, she took the clothes on the back of the chair and left.
1:23:23|1:23:33|Wu Sang stood up again after seeing it. Back at the hotel, Liang Xiaoxiao soaked in the hot spring alone.
1:23:33|1:23:49|Night fell quietly, with only a hint of the sun's afterglow hanging in the sky. Dressed, [Liang Xiaoxiao] stood at the pier, gazing towards the distant sea, her figure the only one on the pier.
1:23:57|1:24:14|On the other side, after finishing their meal, [Qin Fen] and [Wu Sang] drove to the downtown area. After getting out of the car, the two of them walked and talked.
1:25:35|1:25:41|Wu Sang, with a puzzled look on his face, hadn't reacted yet,
1:27:1|1:27:24|After a while, [Liang Xiaoxiao] got out of the taxi and stopped outside the izakaya. She then walked into the izakaya.
1:27:27|1:27:41|The atmosphere in the room was filled with joy at this moment. [Wu Sang] held Xia Dai's hand and sang on the stage, while Xue Jiang danced beside them.
1:27:42|1:27:54|And [Qin Fen] wore a funny headgear that looked like a Japanese man's head, twisting the switch on his nose to make his eyebrows move up and down.
1:27:56|1:28:8|[Qin Fen] saw [Liang Xiaoxiao] at the door while fiddling with the headgear switch. Dressed up comically, [Qin Fen] ran to [Liang Xiaoxiao] and twisted his head, making [Liang Xiaoxiao] couldn't help but laugh.
1:28:9|1:28:26|[Qin Fen] held hands with [Liang Xiaoxiao] and started playing with everyone. After a joyful night at the izakaya,
1:28:26|1:28:42|The next day, the three of them drove to the church in the suburbs. This time, [Qin Fen] and [Liang Xiaoxiao] were both in the back seat, with [Qin Fen] and [Wu Sang] humming local songs in the car.
1:29:6|1:29:18|Beside him, [Liang Xiaoxiao] stifled a laugh and said,
1:31:1|1:31:10|Vehicles pass through a large expanse of sunflower fields, contrasting with the distant brownish-yellow mountains and forests, creating a golden world under the setting sun.
1:31:10|1:31:21|Not long after, the car stopped on the road, with no one around for miles. A two-story small house stood out on the vast grassland.
1:32:7|1:32:13|Wu Sang then led Qin Fen into the church. After a brief conversation with the priest, Wu Sang walked out of the church, leaving Qin Fen alone.
1:32:30|1:32:35|[Qin Fen] walked over and knelt in front of the godfather, placing his hands on the Bible.
1:32:40|1:32:52|After the godfather completed the basic confession ceremony, he said to [Qin Fen], "Let's begin."
1:33:16|1:33:24|Wu Sang, waiting outside the church, came out of the car and handed a cup of water to Liang Xiaoxiao. Liang Xiaoxiao smiled and took it, and the two started chatting.
1:33:56|1:33:59|After listening, [Liang Xiaoxiao] thought for a moment and said,
1:34:21|1:34:28|[Liang Xiaoxiao] turned around, looking at the scenery without saying a word.
1:34:59|1:35:3|[Wu Sang] listened and then walked to the other side of the car, took out a cigarette and lit it up.
1:35:38|1:36:2|The time on the clock has passed more than two hours, [Qin Fen] is still kneeling in front of the godfather confessing quietly. The godfather with gray hair stood up, sweating profusely, physically and mentally exhausted, unable to stand any longer. He helplessly found a chair to sit down and massaged his legs.
1:36:2|1:36:10|The setting sun shines on Liang Xiaoxiao's face as she lowers her head to look at the watch on her wrist.
1:37:40|1:37:45|Time passes by minute by minute, and even the sun is about to set soon.
1:37:52|1:38:3|Wu Sang and Liang Xiaoxiao, who had been waiting outside, also fell asleep in the car. The frustrated godfather couldn't take it anymore and ran out to wake them up.
1:38:52|1:39:3|[Qin Fen] was still talking excitedly. As the three of them were driving in the car, [Wu Sang] joked,
1:39:47|1:39:57|The vehicle continued to drive on the road, and by the time the three of them arrived at the island, it was already evening. So after resting for a night, they boarded the small island the next day.
1:39:57|1:40:4|The island has beautiful surroundings, surrounded by the sea.
1:40:4|1:40:17|The vegetation is lush, the air is fresh, but [Liang Xiaoxiao] looks restless. [Wu Sang] and [Qin Fen] find a hot spring,
1:40:29|1:40:32|After listening, [Qin Fen] looked around for [Liang Xiaoxiao].
1:40:33|1:40:48|At this moment, [Liang Xiaoxiao] stood still with a blank expression, tears visible on her face. Worried, [Qin Fen] ran over and pulled [Liang Xiaoxiao] away.
1:41:10|1:41:29|Two backpack-carrying hikers approached, and [Wu Sang] stepped forward to ask. One of the hikers, looking flustered, said,
1:41:42|1:41:46|The hiker burst into laughter after seeing the expression on [Qin Fen]'s face.
1:41:57|1:42:13|[Qin Fen], along with two others and the tourists on the island, started playing a game called "Here Comes the Bear". [Qin Fen] dressed up in a bear costume to play the bear. The rules of the game were that everyone had to lie on the ground, and if the bear managed to flip someone over, that person had to immediately return to their original position. The game began.
1:42:13|1:42:39|Xiong approached [Liang Xiaoxiao], flipped her over, patted her with his paw, sniffed her with his nose, and occasionally made low growling sounds, like a real bear.
1:42:58|1:43:4|[Qin Fen] lay on his side next to [Liang Xiaoxiao], placing his hand on her belly, and whispered softly,
1:43:6|1:43:14|Liang Xiaoxiao placed her hand on Qin Fen's bear paw.
1:43:43|1:44:2|After the game, [Qin Fen] and [Liang Xiaoxiao] arrived at the seaside. The sea breeze felt particularly cold on the vast cliff edge. [Liang Xiaoxiao] nodded, and seeing that she didn't want to walk, [Qin Fen] took off his coat and put it on her.
1:44:12|1:44:23|Liang Xiaoxiao saw Qin Fen trying to light a cigarette but couldn't.
1:44:24|1:44:38|[Qin Fen] declined, glanced at [Liang Xiaoxiao], and then handed her the cigarette case and lighter. [Liang Xiaoxiao] lowered her head to light the cigarette, while [Qin Fen] cooperatively used his jacket to block the wind.
1:44:41|1:44:50|After lighting a cigarette, [Liang Xiaoxiao] took a puff and passed the cigarette to [Qin Fen]. [Qin Fen] took the cigarette, glanced at it, and then smoked while looking at the sea.
1:44:50|1:45:14|[Liang Xiaoxiao] leaned her head on [Qin Fen]'s shoulder. [Qin Fen] turned his head to look at [Liang Xiaoxiao] and then turned back. The two of them snuggled up to each other in silence. After a while, [Liang Xiaoxiao] spoke up.
1:45:29|1:45:44|[Liang Xiaoxiao] nodded and replied, [Liang Xiaoxiao] turned her head.
1:45:44|1:45:52|Looking up slightly towards the distance, she asked [Qin Fen],
1:46:2|1:46:23|[Liang Xiaoxiao] looked at [Qin Fen] with a determined gaze without blinking. After listening, [Liang Xiaoxiao] leaned on [Qin Fen]'s shoulder with her eyes closed, recalling the scene of her and Wang Xin at this place.
1:46:25|1:46:35|She was lying on Wang Xin's chest and asked,
1:47:23|1:47:31|Back in reality, [Liang Xiaoxiao] went alone to the hot spring in the woods. She took off her clothes and placed them on a nearby rock before walking down.
1:47:33|1:47:44|In the vast forest, she was the only one soaking in the hot spring. Back at the hotel, Liang Xiaoxiao wrote a letter to Qin Fen in her own room.
1:49:11|1:49:16|[Liang Xiaoxiao] slipped the written letter through the crack in the door.
1:49:20|1:49:28|After Liang Xiaoxiao left, Qin Fen came to the cliff where she used to promise to marry her.
1:49:34|1:49:43|From the hillside to the cliff edge, there was not a hint of expression on [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s face, and one could not sense any hesitation in her firm and steady steps.
1:49:54|1:49:59|[Liang Xiaoxiao] stepped over the low fence and stood at the closest point to the edge of the cliff.
1:50:2|1:50:21|She looked out at the calm ocean in the distance, her eyes unusually dim. After a moment, she leaped down and fell into the sea.
1:50:26|1:50:40|In the sea, [Liang Xiaoxiao] remained calm, with her eyes closed and mouth slightly open. Bubbles occasionally emerged from her mouth and nostrils, her body relaxed without any sign of struggle.
1:50:40|1:50:48|The hair and scarf swayed gently in the water as the sea flowed.
1:51:8|1:51:17|The next day, Qin Fen and Wu Sang, who had just woken up, drove to the seaside after seeing the letter. The two of them did not speak a word all the way.
1:51:18|1:51:45|At the seaside, Qin Fen met the police officer who was dealing with the matter. Qin Fen sat on the railing with his hands in his pockets, watching Liang Xiaoxiao jump into the sea. The weeds beside Qin Fen swayed gently in the sea breeze.
1:51:45|1:51:51|After Wu Sang and the police understood the situation, he said to Qin Fen,
1:51:55|1:52:5|[Qin Fen] looked down at the sea, taking a long time to come back to his senses.
1:52:16|1:52:29|After finishing speaking, the two stood up and headed to the hospital. Inside the hospital, a nurse drew back the curtain.
1:52:30|1:52:39|The two saw [Liang Xiaoxiao] lying on the hospital bed, with bandages wrapped around her arms and legs, sucking on the oxygen machine without moving.
1:52:39|1:52:56|[Qin Fen] walked to the bedside, looking at the rosy eyes of [Liang Xiaoxiao], with a very dull look in his eyes. Sitting down, [Qin Fen] sighed, touched [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s hand and said,
1:53:2|1:53:23|At this moment, a tear rolled down the corner of [Liang Xiaoxiao]'s eye, and [Qin Fen] stood up to wipe it away for her.
1:53:26|1:53:35|Outside the hospital, [Wu Sang] was smoking, and the two of them remained silent for a long time.
1:53:37|1:53:45|After a moment of silence, [Wu Sang] and [Qin Fen] bid farewell.
1:54:2|1:54:12|[Qin Fen] took out an envelope of money from his pocket,
1:54:20|1:54:30|After speaking, [Wu Sang] handed the money to [Qin Fen], who then placed the envelope in the car.
1:55:1|1:55:14|[Wu Sang] watched [Qin Fen] from the car, as [Qin Fen] wiped away a tear with one hand and waved with the other. On their separate ways back, [Wu Sang] and [Qin Fen] sang a Japanese song about cherishing friendship.
1:56:35|1:57:24|[Wu Sang] cried while pulling over the car, then calmly continued driving. The car gradually disappeared from view as it went further down the road. Some time later, [Liang Xiaoxiao] recovered from her injuries and left the hospital with [Qin Fen].
1:57:24|1:57:40|Liang Xiaoxiao, who has not fully recovered, sits in a wheelchair while Qin Fen pushes her from behind on a cruise ship, preparing to return to their country. On the huge cruise ship, Qin Fen pushes Liang Xiaoxiao out onto the deck to get some fresh air.
1:57:55|1:57:59|[Liang Xiaoxiao] took the phone and dialed Wang Xin's number.
1:58:48|1:58:54|[Qin Fen] understood what [Liang Xiaoxiao] said and kissed her.
1:59:5|1:59:13|[Qin Fen] stopped and looked towards the other side after hearing these words, while [Mr. Fan] was selling the divisive terminal machine by the pool.
2:0:18|2:1:1|[Mr. Fan] was wearing a disposable bathrobe and slippers, holding a divergence terminal in despair as he walked step by step towards the edge of the boat. Once at the edge, [Mr. Fan] raised the divergence terminal high, ready to throw it away. Just then, a voice came from behind. [Mr. Fan] slowly turned around, and with a trembling voice, he said,
2:1:3|2:1:21|[Qin Fen] watched as he nodded earnestly, while [Mr. Fan] continued to hold up the terminal device in tears. [Qin Fen] wiped away his tears and embraced him.
