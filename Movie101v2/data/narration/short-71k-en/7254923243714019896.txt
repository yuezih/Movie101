0:0:49|0:0:56|At Yan Zhao Agricultural University, classmates walked into the teaching building together, but the boy ran in the opposite direction and stopped the girls to ask.
0:1:12|0:1:17|At this moment, the girl behind him quietly left.
0:1:17|0:1:29|In the girls' dormitory, the fixed beds look neat and tidy. The dormitory is simple yet cozy, and everyone is busy packing their luggage. Suddenly, the girl at the back sits on the bed and sighs.
0:2:9|0:2:19|The girl sitting on the bed opposite seemed to have touched upon [Shan Xing's Dad]'s innermost thoughts with a single sentence. She sat on the edge of the bed holding clothes, lost in thought, staring blankly ahead.
0:3:2|0:3:14|The scene shifts to four years ago, in the peaceful village, a man walks briskly into the courtyard, while the middle-aged man who is repairing the car pays no attention at all.
0:3:14|0:3:27|[Zhishu] strides ahead, with the middle-aged man following closely behind.
0:4:17|0:4:22|[Zhishu] carefully examined the acceptance letter in his hand and then confidently spoke.
0:5:4|0:5:7|[Shan Xing's Dad] and [Zhishu] stood in place, watching as [Zhishu] left.
0:5:7|0:5:13|Later, [Shan Xing's Dad] looked at his wife beside him, but at this moment, his wife also didn't know what to do.
0:5:28|0:5:33|The old man dangled his pipe, staring thoughtfully at the back of [Zhishu].
0:5:42|0:5:51|[Shan Xing]'s home. [Shan Xing] is walking into the courtyard with a hoe, wiping the sweat off her forehead as she walks. Seeing water in the tub, she bends down to scoop some up.
0:5:51|0:6:2|After a busy day, she didn't even have time to put down the hoe. She picked up a ladle with one hand and started drinking. After quenching her thirst, she finally walked to the corner of the wall, put down the hoe, and shouted towards the inner room.
0:6:3|0:6:7|Hearing her daughter's call, the mother walked towards the table expressionlessly.
0:6:8|0:6:13|He ignored [Shan Xing] standing in front of him, picked up the admission letter on the table and handed it to [Shan Xing].
0:6:13|0:6:18|The father sat on a nearby bench, propping up his head with one hand, staring fixedly at the ground.
0:6:18|0:6:25|But when [Shan Xing] took the acceptance letter and read it carefully, [Shan Xing's Mom] turned her head to the side, not knowing how to face this matter.
0:6:26|0:6:30|Upon seeing that she was accepted, [Shan Xing] showed a joyful expression.
0:6:30|0:6:36|However, as she continued to read down, she was shocked to find out that the tuition fee for enrollment was as high as 6500 yuan.
0:6:36|0:6:42|Her face froze in an instant, staring incredulously at the acceptance letter.
0:6:42|0:6:47|Later, she put the admission letter back on the table and walked out.
0:6:47|0:6:55|Standing at the door, [Zhishu] suppressed her inner resentment, staring blankly ahead. Then, she walked out the door with heavy steps.
0:6:55|0:7:15|Facing the silence of her parents, she deeply understands the pain within. Unconsciously, she finds herself on the bridge.
0:7:44|0:7:52|Perhaps some people already know that the words of [Zhishu] made everyone present lower their heads in silence.
0:9:3|0:9:10|Zhishu warned everyone on the street, and the woman beside him quickly covered her mouth and nose, afraid that she might cry out loud.
0:10:11|0:10:13|Let's go, everyone can go their separate ways.
0:10:13|0:10:18|On the other side, [Shan Xing] sat alone at the desk, staring fixedly at the tabletop.
0:10:18|0:10:21|At this moment, the neighbors all turned off their lights and went to rest.
0:10:21|0:10:28|Although the mother had gone to bed early, she couldn't sleep all night, thinking about everything that had happened during the day.
0:10:32|0:10:37|She increasingly couldn't control her emotions and could only turn her body inward.
0:10:37|0:10:40|At the same time, next door, [Shan Xing's Dad] was already in tears.
0:10:41|0:10:44|He stared intently at the neatly arranged money on the table.
0:11:23|0:11:37|The money is arranged from small to large, with a shot of his acceptance letter placed in front of him. This is his only chance, a series of tears silently stream down his sorrowful face, without a sound, letting the tears flow continuously.
0:11:37|0:11:45|Unknowingly, he fell asleep on the table, tears streaking his cheeks. The next morning, Xier, heading out away from home.
0:12:12|0:12:19|The young man from the same village stared intently at the door of [Shan Xing]'s house, while the girl quietly followed him as he walked ahead, tidying his clothes.
0:12:34|0:12:37|See [Shan Xing] open the door, and the person outside immediately walks up.
0:12:53|0:12:58|Everyone walked towards the village entrance together, unaware that the villagers were already waiting there.
0:12:58|0:13:2|Upon seeing [Shan Xing], people of all ages stood up to bid farewell.
0:13:17|0:13:24|After speaking, Xiaoduo's eyes were filled with tears as she reluctantly stepped back, while [Shan Xing] continued to move forward under the crowd's escort.
0:14:8|0:14:12|[Shan Xing] held the food in his hands, feeling grateful inside.
0:14:12|0:14:15|She looked at the villagers standing halfway up the mountain.
0:14:27|0:14:31|With a deep bow from [Shan Xing], the villagers waved goodbye to him.
0:14:31|0:14:35|At the same time, [Zhishu] packed the full bundle of cloth into the Sonali.
0:14:35|0:14:39|When the sound of the saxophone echoed, the entire air was filled with the scent of farewell.
0:15:38|0:15:49|After listening, [Shan Xing] looked at the ticket collector in shock, then he pretended to be calm and took out some change from his pocket. However, he couldn't bear to spend the money that the villagers had worked so hard to put together.
0:15:49|0:15:55|He casually folded Lv Shun's money back up, tightly gripped it in his hand, put the money into his pocket, and looked at the driver.
0:16:17|0:16:23|After getting off the car with her, a car zoomed past. She picked up the heavy backpack again and lifted the luggage in her right hand.
0:16:23|0:16:29|Although the school bag was heavy and the journey was long, compared to [Shan Xing]'s future, it was nothing at all.
0:16:48|0:16:50|Suddenly, someone outside the window shouted.
0:16:53|0:16:56|The roommate hurried back inside from the balcony to inform him.
0:16:58|0:17:13|[Shan Xing] listened and quickly put down the clothes in his hands, got up and went downstairs to the appointment. When he saw [Zhishu], he quickened his pace and walked up to him, while [Zhishu] was waiting quietly on the garden path, with something hidden behind his back.
0:17:18|0:17:20|[Shan Xing] looked closely and found it was actually an employment contract.
0:18:36|0:18:40|[Shan Xing] took the phone in disbelief and looked at [Wu Yiliang] in confusion.
0:18:40|0:18:47|But at this moment, [Zhishu] lowered his head shyly, knowing [Shan Xing's Dad]'s unfairness and not wanting to trouble him further.
0:19:20|0:19:27|[Wu Yiliang] may have deep feelings for [Shan Xing], but he cannot stop her from doing what she wants.
0:19:27|0:19:33|After bidding farewell to each other, [Shan Xing] embarked on his journey back home, this time opting to take the bus.
0:19:33|0:19:43|He stood by the window, watching the passing scenery, feeling a mix of emotions in his heart. The car snaked up the steep mountain road, and at the mountaintop, he saw many apricot blossoms in full bloom on the branches.
0:19:44|0:19:54|Upon returning to the street, as the bus approached the village entrance and the driver parked the bus, [Shan Xing] immediately got off the bus. Seeing everything familiar, he was filled with mixed emotions.
0:19:54|0:20:6|He hurriedly walked to the side of the small road, taking in the changes around him. Just then, Xiaoduo, who was pedaling hard on his bicycle behind the car, recognized him and quickly stopped to say hello.
0:21:53|0:21:58|After speaking, [Shan Xing] looked worried, furrowing her brow and gazing elsewhere.
0:22:16|0:22:21|Xiao Duo used a bicycle to carry the luggage for [Shan Xing], and the two walked towards the village together.
0:22:21|0:22:25|Shortly after, [Shan Xing] pushed open the door of his house and looked at [Shan Xing's Mom] sitting by the kang.
0:23:50|0:23:54|[Shan Xing] looked at [Shan Xing's Mom], who was working so hard, with tears in her eyes.
0:26:24|0:26:28|To work hard for education.
0:26:39|0:26:50|Facing the selfless dedication of his family, [Shan Xing] is full of heartache. He looks helplessly at [Shan Xing's Dad] resting by the kang, silently vowing to ensure that his family will have a good life.
0:26:50|0:26:54|In the evening, the whole family gathered on the heated brick bed to enjoy a reunion dinner.
0:28:21|0:28:24|The next morning, [Shan Xing] got up early to help her mother tidy up the house.
0:29:0|0:29:13|Upon hearing these words, [Shan Xing] immediately felt a sense of crisis, and then he came up with a good solution.
0:29:13|0:29:16|On the other side, [Zhishu] is also struggling with this matter.
0:32:41|0:32:55|After speaking, [Shan Xing] ran towards the bicycle parked in the courtyard, pushed the bike and started to ride out. His eyes were fixed ahead, his feet alternately pushing down on the pedals with force, the bicycle getting faster and faster, the wind whistling in his ears.
0:32:56|0:33:4|The country road was still rough with gravel, and the bumpy surface made [Shan Xing] unconsciously tighten his hands on the handlebars.
0:33:4|0:33:11|The two little girls happily walked hand in hand, not at all disturbed by the car speeding past [Shan Xing].
0:33:11|0:33:22|Approaching dusk, [Shan Xing] finally arrived at the Fuyangzhai Restaurant in the county. He hurriedly parked his bicycle at the entrance and then ran inside. He stood in the lobby, looking around in confusion.
0:34:13|0:34:19|In the private room, the secretary poured wine for [Zhishu] and the village chief, while Manager Zhang took the opportunity to bring out the prepared herbal tea and cash.
0:34:51|0:35:0|At the same time, [Shan Xing] peered through the crack in the door and saw everything that was happening.
0:37:53|0:37:57|Manager Zhang took out a pile of cash and placed it in front of [Zhishu].
0:37:57|0:38:2|At this moment, [Shan Xing] outside the door had already disguised himself as a waiter, sticking close to the door crack, listening to their conversation.
0:41:32|0:41:39|[Shan Xing] immediately stood up, picked up the cash placed next to [Zhishu], and held the thirty thousand yuan in his hand, shining it back and forth.
0:41:39|0:41:47|The next moment, he looked at the village chief with suspicion in his heart, watching Manager Zhang's eager look, he sarcastically smiled and decisively carried out his plan.
0:43:19|0:43:30|[Shan Xing] placed the contract in front of Manager Zhang, watched him press his fingerprint, and then turned to look at the village chief beside him.
0:43:30|0:43:35|Seeing them all finish putting their fingerprints, [Shan Xing] picked up the contract satisfiedly, looked at it, and sighed with a smile.
0:44:11|0:44:16|Ji Shu pretended to cry and reminded them, and the village chief stood up belatedly.
0:44:18|0:44:27|Let's trick this girl, [Shan Xing] quickly ran out of the restaurant, headed straight for the bicycle at the entrance, and without looking back, he rode off on the bicycle.
0:44:35|0:44:54|At this moment, as the sky darkened, [Shan Xing] accelerated on his bike along the mountain road. Everything around him seemed to want to swallow him up, with endless darkness ahead. He dared not even take a deep breath, his heart pounding in his throat, sweat dripping from his forehead. Suddenly, he faintly heard the long-lost sound of a suona coming from up ahead.
0:45:35|0:45:41|Shortly after, [Shan Xing] got on the car, with Xiaoduo following closely behind, seizing the opportunity to sit steadily in the seat.
0:45:41|0:45:44|The next day, [Shan Xing] was decorating the village's blackboard.
0:48:58|0:49:4|[Shan Xing] turned around with a book in hand, skillfully writing on the blackboard with chalk, while [Zhishu] maintained order on the side.
0:49:4|0:49:7|The villagers sat below, listening attentively.
0:49:7|0:49:11|Back home, [Shan Xing] quietly buried herself in hard work in the family warehouse.
0:49:11|0:49:15|She inserted the apricot branches into different bottles and observed their changes.
0:49:15|0:49:19|The mother brought her dinner with a look of concern on her face.
0:49:42|0:49:47|But after the mother left, [Shan Xing] picked up the bottle next to him and observed the apricot tree branches inside.
0:49:47|0:49:50|Sparse leaves on the slender tree trunk.
0:49:50|0:49:55|She scrutinized the growth of the branches, propping up her chin with one hand, her brow furrowed.
0:49:55|0:50:0|Early the next morning, [Shan Xing] took a magnifying glass and observed the budding apricot trees in the apricot orchard.
0:50:0|0:50:6|[Ma Dongmei] is responsible for recording data on the side.
0:50:13|0:50:17|Just then, [Wu Yiliang] suddenly appeared behind him.
0:51:25|0:51:37|Hey, [Zhishu], don't underestimate [Shan Xing's Mom]. Who knows, one day, hmph. Upon hearing this, [Shan Xing's Mom] turned around and left in anger.
0:52:36|0:52:44|[Wu Yiliang] lowered his head in embarrassment, then [Shan Xing's Mom] and Xiaomei pushed the millstone together to grind beans at the doorstep.
0:53:19|0:53:22|Although it has a certain effect on preserving the freshness of the crab.
0:54:38|0:54:42|The two of them walked and chatted, unconsciously walking to the riverside.
0:55:55|0:55:57|Upon returning to the village.
0:56:0|0:56:3|Zhishu and Shan Xing's Dad have had another bountiful harvest after several years.
0:57:8|0:57:11|After [Shan Xing's Mom] left, [Zhishu] stood in place and let out a deep sigh.
0:57:11|0:57:16|Although he supports [Shan Xing's Mom]'s actions, he is also worried about her.
0:57:16|0:57:20|Shortly after, [Zhishu] led a road construction mobilization meeting with [Shan Xing].
0:59:9|0:59:28|Speak up, [Zhishu] casually took out a cigarette from the side of his clothes, lit it, flipped the cigarette box up, then sniffed the cigarette at the pen, and finally looked at the mountain path, saying.
0:59:28|0:59:35|[Zhishu] helplessly put the cigarette back into the pack.
0:59:48|0:59:52|[Zhishu] had just walked out of the shed when he was stopped at the door by the villagers questioning him.
1:0:41|1:0:54|Xuanxin looked at the hands of the villagers covered in scars, he tightly furrowed his brows, holding back tears, and said with a guilty look on his face.
1:1:8|1:1:19|After the villagers left, [Shan Xing] lowered her head in shame, the successive blows causing her to deeply doubt herself.
1:1:19|1:1:22|When [Shan Xing] returned home, [Shan Xing's Mom] walked up to him and showed concern.
1:1:40|1:1:43|[Shan Xing] picked up the water glass on the table and drank it down in one gulp.
1:2:25|1:2:31|The mother watched her daughter toil day and night, her eyes full of heartache, then she reluctantly turned and left.
1:2:31|1:2:45|[Shan Xing] looked at her mother's back, suddenly feeling a wave of sadness. The light reflected her mother's frail body, with the years leaving deep marks on her face. Thinking about her own situation, she felt sorry for them, afraid of letting them down.
1:3:43|1:3:58|Shan Xing's Mom stepped on air and fell down the hill.
1:3:58|1:4:1|On the other side, [Shan Xing] is having a meeting with the village committee in the shed.
1:5:33|1:5:37|The boy had just run out when he was knocked down by [Wu Yiliang], who came to visit [Shan Xing].
1:5:37|1:5:41|He ignored his own injuries and quickly got up to look for [Shan Xing].
1:5:41|1:5:46|Upon finding that there was no one at the Zhu family's house, [Zhishu] quickly ran to the Yuan family's house.
1:5:46|1:5:50|At the same time, they quickly lifted [Shan Xing's Mom] up, preparing to take her to the hospital.
1:5:58|1:6:6|At this moment, [Shan Xing] is still in the shed attending a meeting, unaware of what has happened at home.
1:7:41|1:7:46|Zhishu noticed Shan Xing's firm attitude towards his surname, and he furrowed his brows deep in thought.
1:8:8|1:8:21|Shan Xing rushed home without asking questions, while at the same time, neighbors carried Shan Xing's Mom to the village entrance.
1:8:21|1:8:30|Shortly after everyone left the village, [Shan Xing] ran back and pushed open the door, calling out for her mother. However, she received no response, and her voice echoed throughout the entire courtyard.
1:8:34|1:8:38|She pushed open the door and looked around, but [Shan Xing's Mom] was nowhere to be seen.
1:8:38|1:8:45|The empty room made her regretful, and suddenly, she noticed a missing door, instantly realizing the seriousness of the situation.
1:9:1|1:9:7|Running quickly on a narrow path, the surface of the road is uneven, paved with stones of different sizes.
1:9:13|1:9:35|Shan Xing's Mom, who is in a coma, keeps calling out Shan Xing's name. Shan Xing is rushing over with all her might. Halfway there, Shan Xing trips over a stone. Despite the pain, she gets up and continues running.
1:9:35|1:9:41|[Shan Xing's Mom] furrowed her brows, nodded slightly, while her brother quickly looked towards the small path behind, trying to find his sister's figure.
1:9:48|1:9:52|[Shan Xing's Mom] slowly lifted her head to look at her husband, who quickly comforted her.
1:10:17|1:10:21|The younger brother intended to catch the thumbs-up gesture from [Shan Xing's Mom], but ended up grabbing nothing.
1:10:59|1:11:2|Suddenly, [Shan Xing] was tripped by a stone, tears welling up in her eyes as she crawled towards [Shan Xing's Mom].
1:12:39|1:12:52|Since [Shan Xing's Mom] left, the house became empty and deserted. The low-roofed tile house was devoid of sunlight for a long time, dim and damp. The damaged walls became uneven, neglected and unattended, allowing free roaming inside the house.
1:12:52|1:12:58|On the other side, [Wu Yiliang] held the apricot blossoms in his hands and slowly approached the grave of [Shan Xing's Mom], kneeling down to brush away the dust on the tombstone.
1:12:59|1:13:12|Later, as the apricot blossoms were set down, at the same time, the nearby [Shan Xing] tree swayed in the wind, petals fluttering in the air. One by one, the petals spun and drifted down from the sky, resembling a butterfly floating, and suddenly came flying towards them.
1:13:12|1:13:17|He stared at the tombstone, slowly stood up, with a heavy heart, and lowered his head.
1:13:18|1:13:24|[Wu Yiliang] never expected that such a tragic incident would happen during his first visit to [Shan Xing's Dad]'s mother.
1:13:24|1:13:28|He sighed deeply, feeling sorry for [Shan Xing].
1:13:28|1:13:33|Later, with a look of helplessness, [Shan Xing's Dad] turned and walked away. [Shan Xing], who was hiding nearby, saw everything he had done.
1:13:34|1:13:37|Watching his lonely figure, my heart is in turmoil.
1:13:37|1:13:42|[Wu Yiliang] has been silently giving his support from behind, but he lacks the courage to respond to this matter.
1:13:42|1:13:46|A few days later, the village committee posted a notice, which read:
1:15:12|1:15:23|The members of the Central Pavilion team, dressed in deliberately colorful silk, lined up in neat formation, lightly stepping to the drumbeat, skillfully and methodically leading the way, the entire square enveloped in a cheerful atmosphere.
1:15:23|1:15:34|As more and more people gathered to watch, the Yangge team began to reach one climax after another, with the trumpet player blowing his best. People from the Yangge team were performing freely and unrestrainedly.
1:15:48|1:15:54|At this moment, the villagers had already crowded in front of the village committee.
1:17:28|1:17:34|Day after day, year after year, the farmers' faces gradually became thinner, with the calluses on their hands clearly visible.
1:17:34|1:17:49|No matter how difficult the conditions are, farmers will persist in their work. Only through labor can they escape poverty, and better days are just around the corner.
1:18:26|1:18:29|The tricycle drove away swiftly.
1:18:54|1:19:2|On this day, a luxury car drove towards Xinghua Gou village, with the big boss sitting in the back seat looking around at the surroundings.
1:19:15|1:19:19|Unconsciously, the luxury car has arrived at the entrance of Xinghua Gou Village.
1:19:19|1:19:29|Due to the unpaved cement road leading into the village, the car was moving very slowly until it finally came to a stop, and then the big boss got out of the car.
1:19:29|1:19:33|At this moment, the driver did not get out of the car, but instead opened the window, waiting quietly for the big boss's instructions.
1:19:41|1:19:44|The boss walked along a small path and unexpectedly entered the apricot forest.
1:21:14|1:21:18|[Shan Xing] then turned his head to the side and after a moment of thought, spoke.
1:22:45|1:22:49|The two sisters smiled at each other, their long efforts finally being recognized.
1:22:49|1:22:57|From a distance, the orchard of [Shan Xing] looked like an ocean of flowers, with clusters of apricot blossoms dazzling the eyes and overwhelming the senses.
1:22:57|1:23:0|They walked hand in hand, playing in the apricot grove, unable to help but sigh.
1:23:41|1:23:48|[Shan Xing's Mom] pulled Xiaomei towards the nearby apricot tree, where every branch was covered with clusters of blossoms, creating a beautiful scene.
1:23:48|1:23:51|She picked a flower and put it on Xiaomei's head.
1:24:1|1:24:7|Immediately, she turned around and picked a flower, joyfully putting it on [Shan Xing's Mom].
1:24:7|1:24:10|At the same time, [Shan Xing's Dad] looked at her and shook his head.
1:24:26|1:24:31|As night fell, the two sisters quickly ran down the hill, followed by the sound of children playing games.
1:25:19|1:25:26|The children facing each other are laughing happily, while on the other side, [Shan Xing] is quickly caught up by Xiao Mei, panting as she chases after her.
1:25:39|1:25:46|Xiaomei hurriedly ran up the hill, hoping for [Shan Xing] to catch up, but at that moment, [Shan Xing] fell down while climbing the slope.
1:25:46|1:25:53|She staggered up the hill, struggling to stand up, suddenly feeling dizzy and disoriented, everything becoming blurry.
1:25:53|1:26:2|In a dizzying moment, she almost stumbled and touched her forehead, looking up at the sky. The trees in front of her kept spinning, even creating multiple images.
1:26:3|1:26:14|The mind was like a stagnant pool in the dark night, with no ripples, everything around seemed unrelated to her, like a rotten wood falling down effortlessly.
1:26:14|1:26:20|At the same time, [Ma Dongmei], who was running ahead, suddenly stopped, clutching her chest and gasping for breath.
1:26:20|1:26:25|When she heard no sound behind her, she turned around and shouted with a worried look on her face.
1:26:44|1:26:59|The villagers hurried to the apricot forest, and together they lifted [Shan Xing] onto the van. The van then sped down the road at the fastest speed.
1:26:59|1:27:13|At this moment, [Shan Xing] looked haggard, with pale lips, lying weakly in Xiaomei's arms. His father and brother sat on either side with furrowed brows, anxiously calling out to [Shan Xing], afraid that he might fall asleep. The driver could only rush to the hospital at the fastest speed.
1:28:22|1:28:31|[Zhishu] comforted [Shan Xing] with a smile, although feeling heartbroken inside. He covered [Shan Xing]'s hand with a blanket, and at the same time, [Wu Yiliang] rushed over upon hearing the news.
1:28:45|1:28:47|The two finally let go of the burden in their hearts.
1:29:31|1:29:35|[Zhishu] furrowed his brows.
1:29:35|1:29:47|Wu Yiliang regretted his decision, nodding continuously and holding back tears as he looked at [Shan Xing].
1:29:51|1:29:57|[Shan Xing] withdrew her gaze in disappointment, while [Zhishu] glared angrily at Wu Yiliang beside her.
1:29:57|1:30:3|Seeing [Shan Xing] about to lie down, Zhishu quickly supported [Shan Xing]'s head and helped her to a comfortable position.
1:30:3|1:30:5|Wu Yiliang got up to leave as soon as he saw the situation.
1:30:5|1:30:12|In front of the door, he reluctantly looked back at [Shan Xing], but she did not try to stop him, instead turning her head to the other side.
1:30:12|1:30:16|He didn't look towards the door until he heard the sound of it closing.
1:30:20|1:30:23|The gap between the two is significant and not something that can be bridged in a short time.
1:30:26|1:30:34|Wu Yiliang walked out of the hospital with one hand in his pocket, his back looking somewhat desolate, and he left without looking back.
1:31:6|1:31:9|Satisfied with Xiaomei's answer, [Shan Xing's Dad] lowered his head.
