0:1:18|0:1:27|At this moment, the TV is broadcasting the news of the successful resolution of the shocking child abduction case that has rocked society.
0:1:27|0:1:36|Under the scorching sun, a car roared past, and on the counter of the wheat department, a sleeping face gradually moved into the screen.
0:1:36|0:1:40|[Chen Xuesong] rests his head on his arms, tightly closing his eyes, while the bangs behind his ears sway with the breeze from the fan.
0:1:42|0:1:48|At this moment, the sound of the TV grew louder and louder, with the children's cries and the alarming sirens blending together.
0:1:57|0:2:1|Turning his head to the other side, he was deeply attracted by the news on the TV.
0:2:1|0:2:4|At this moment, the television is detailing the specifics of this kidnapping case.
0:2:10|0:2:14|Yuchengbao has gradually become familiar with the police officers.
0:2:38|0:2:44|[Wu Yanjun] walked into the supermarket wearing a floral shirt, smiling brightly, and took out his wallet from his pocket as he walked.
0:2:44|0:2:50|[Chen Xuesong] nonchalantly lowered his head and found the all-too-familiar 300 yuan in change in the drawer.
0:2:50|0:2:53|[Wu Yanjun] took out money from his pocket, but his eyes never left [Chen Xuesong]'s face.
0:2:54|0:3:4|[Chen Xuesong] handed over some change, turned his head to look at the TV. At this moment, the other person handed him a bill, which he glanced at before accepting. He then turned around and handed over a pack of cigarettes.
0:3:33|0:3:35|But he looked around nervously.
0:3:40|0:3:47|The emperor, upon hearing these words, [Chen Xuesong] rolled his eyes, while [Wu Yanjun] grinned from ear to ear.
0:3:52|0:3:58|The romantic atmosphere was suddenly interrupted, [Wu Yanjun] awkwardly smiled, stood up and bid farewell.
0:3:58|0:4:3|[Wu Yanjun] walked away, but his eyes were fixed on the woman in front of him.
0:4:3|0:4:7|[Chen Xuesong] looked at [Wu Yanjun] defiantly until the latter got into a taxi.
0:4:7|0:4:13|At this moment, [Cai Weihang] brought a Chongqing boss to the abandoned pasture.
0:4:13|0:4:15|Boss Lin walked in, looked around with his head held high.
0:4:53|0:4:58|Cai Weihang looked down at the bright line and smiled as the car of his old classmate drove off in a cloud of dust.
0:5:26|0:5:29|At the same time, [Chen Xuesong] arrived at the school gate to wait for his daughter to finish school.
0:5:29|0:5:32|He touched his head, but didn't see the figure of his daughter.
0:5:32|0:5:34|Other children were taken away one by one.
0:5:34|0:5:35|He grabbed a child and asked.
0:5:48|0:5:58|This sentence scared [Cai Weihang] quite a bit, she immediately took out her phone from her bag and made a call, looking around anxiously.
0:5:58|0:6:1|Upon learning that her husband did not pick up their daughter, [Chen Xuesong] immediately turned around and headed home.
0:6:3|0:6:6|He was so anxious that he kept calling his daughter's name all the way.
0:6:6|0:6:11|The passing old lady carrying a child, Cai Weihang always looks back anxiously, wondering if it is his daughter.
0:6:11|0:6:15|In a panic, [Cai Weihang] ran through the corridor and arrived at the front door of his house, sweating profusely.
0:6:15|0:6:20|He was ready to push the door open, only to find that the door of his own home was still locked.
0:6:20|0:6:25|[Chen Xuesong] frowned and looked around the house.
0:6:29|0:6:33|The street was bustling with people and the mixed sounds of vehicles.
0:6:33|0:6:40|Chen Xuesong's heart gradually fell into fear, thinking about the news of child abduction a few days ago, her legs were getting weak.
0:6:40|0:6:45|There is only one last hope now, she hurriedly walked through the streets.
0:6:45|0:6:49|Simultaneously, he kept looking around to see if there was any sign of his daughter.
0:6:49|0:6:52|The sound of the tattooed voice in his ear, he quickened his pace to find his daughter.
0:6:52|0:6:57|Before long, she arrived at a military camp building and could hear the sound of mahjong and ping pong from a distance.
0:6:57|0:7:10|She glanced roughly at the door, about to go out, and caught a glimpse of a figure in a daze. She turned back to confirm again, only to find that it was her daughter.
0:7:10|0:7:16|Watching Yuan Yuan and her mother-in-law eating together, Cai Weihang finally let go of the burden in her heart, but she couldn't help feeling a bit angry inside.
0:7:19|0:7:30|He smiled in response to the neighbor's greeting, sat on the bench next to him at a loss, and turned to look at the harmonious scene of the grandfather and grandson.
0:7:30|0:7:35|Suddenly, for some reason, [Chen Xuesong]'s face turned dark, and he immediately stood up and walked out the door.
0:7:35|0:7:41|On the other side, Grandma is lighting the candles on the cake, and [Yuan Yuan] points at the candles and counts, saying to Grandma.
0:7:42|0:7:47|Grandma chuckled and patted [Yuan Yuan]'s head.
0:7:47|0:7:50|Finally, the two of them blew out the candle with puffed cheeks.
0:7:50|0:7:53|At this moment, [Chen Xuesong] arrived at his mother-in-law's residence.
0:8:1|0:8:7|He, who didn't want to talk, turned his head to look outside the main gate, then walked up the stairs and sat down on the chair outside the house.
0:8:7|0:8:12|After all the running around, [Chen Xuesong] was sweating profusely and his hair was soaked.
0:8:12|0:8:15|He glanced at the bag on the table, then opened it and started searching inside.
0:8:17|0:8:23|Following that, she took out a small fan from inside and blew it fiercely towards herself after opening the cover.
0:8:23|0:8:27|At this moment, the phone rang, but she, feeling comfortable, was unwilling to answer.
0:8:27|0:8:36|Reluctantly, she turned off the fan and took out her phone from her bag only when the phone rang again.
0:8:46|0:8:58|Before [Chen Xuesong] could finish speaking, the person on the other end of the phone had already hung up. He glared angrily, threw the phone down, and then slammed it shut.
0:9:5|0:9:12|The old man didn't say anything after listening, quietly took the key to open the door, and the angry [Chen Xuesong] pushed open the door holding his daughter.
0:9:26|0:9:32|Seeing his daughter in Eva's arms, [Cai Weihang]'s anger gradually turned into grievance, tears welled up in his eyes.
0:9:32|0:9:34|She held back her tears and said.
0:10:4|0:10:9|[Cai Weihang] walked in and glanced down at the cake on the table, only then did he remember that today was his mother's birthday.
0:10:9|0:10:15|He glanced somewhat guiltily at his mother, then placed his helmet and messenger bag on either side of the cake.
0:10:15|0:10:18|[Chen Xuesong] walked over to the side and started to tidy up her bag.
0:10:25|0:10:30|[Cai Weihang] looked at his wife's aggressive and hostile expression, then turned away, unwilling to engage with her.
0:10:30|0:10:35|[Chen Xuesong] watched as her husband, [Cai Weihang], showed no concern, so she turned and took her daughter's hand and walked out.
0:10:35|0:10:40|Cai Weihang, who had not even warmed the chair, sighed helplessly, not knowing how to face his mother.
0:10:40|0:10:46|At this moment, [Chen Xuesong] had already walked to the street corner with his daughter, when they heard the sound of a motorcycle coming from behind.
0:10:48|0:10:52|Still angry, [Chen Xuesong] glanced at her husband and continued to walk forward with her head down.
0:10:52|0:10:57|The daughter looked up at her mother, then let go of her hand and climbed onto the back seat of the motorcycle.
0:10:57|0:11:1|[Chen Xuesong] had no choice but to help his daughter onto the ride reluctantly.
0:11:1|0:11:4|[Cai Weihang] started the motorcycle by twisting the throttle expressionlessly.
0:11:4|0:11:9|Cai Weihang's round little hands tightly held onto her father, while sitting in the back, Wu Yanjun recalled everything that had happened today.
0:11:10|0:11:27|Feeling exhausted both physically and mentally, constantly hearing the sound of air leaking, [Chen Xuesong] gradually pulled himself back from his thoughts. He slightly perked up, looked ahead on the road, but soon, like a deflated ball, he slumped with Ma Dongmei in the middle, sandwiched between them, too afraid to speak.
0:11:28|0:11:42|Later, she turned to look at the residential buildings in the two sheds that were constantly retreating, as if since getting married, her days had been filled with mundane chores, and the simple life seemed to be nothing but a mess, as if there was no time to look up and see the beautiful scenery of this mountain city.
0:11:42|0:11:52|At night, [Chen Xuesong] finished washing up and went to the room. Seeing his daughter already asleep, he gently took the toy from her hand and then patted his husband on the shoulder.
0:11:52|0:11:57|After speaking, she took her daughter's leg off her husband's leg, [Cai Weihang] frowned and slowly helped lift the numb leg.
0:12:0|0:12:3|[Cai Weihang] rolled his eyes and looked at [Chen Xuesong].
0:12:7|0:12:10|[Chen Xuesong] felt guilty after hearing it, but he still didn't let up with his words.
0:12:13|0:12:14|[Cai Weihang] heard him say that.
0:12:14|0:12:16|Turned his head and closed his eyes.
0:12:22|0:12:24|[Chen Xuesong] began to complain incessantly.
0:12:58|0:13:17|Cai Weihang, who was full of anger, couldn't help but speak. Hearing her husband's impatient tone, Chen Xuesong opened her mouth in anger and then immediately retorted. After speaking, she turned her head and went to sleep next to her daughter. Cai Weihang was completely provoked by this sentence, she shook the blanket heavily and then sat up.
0:13:17|0:13:35|Lying next to her, [Chen Xuesong] looked at her like that, also with a displeased expression. Then she spoke up. Cai Weihang, who was still angry, didn't want to talk to her. [Chen Xuesong] sat up again. She gently pushed her husband's shoulder, but he ignored her completely and pushed her hand away without any consideration.
0:13:35|0:13:45|[Chen Xuesong], who knew he was in the wrong, didn't know how to face it. [Cai Weihang], who was silently digesting, lowered his head and closed his eyes, taking a deep breath.
0:13:45|0:13:56|Early the next morning, [Chen Xuesong] opened the supermarket's rolling shutter door, but her mind was still troubled by the argument from yesterday. She looked into the distance, where he seemed to be struggling with something, then leaned against the counter, deep in thought.
0:13:56|0:14:1|He furrowed his brow, repeatedly fumbling with the key in his hand, then sighed helplessly.
0:14:1|0:14:4|After much thought, [Cai Weihang] raised his head, pulled down the curtain, and turned around to leave.
0:14:8|0:14:11|The back of [Chen Xuesong] gradually disappeared at the corner of the street.
0:14:11|0:14:15|After a while, he pushed open a door and walked into the room.
0:14:15|0:14:20|The grandmother was sitting on the bed preparing to administer the medicine. He walked over, put down the bag, and then helped roll up the sleeves.
0:14:20|0:14:24|The harmonious coexistence made both [Cai Weihang] and [Wu Yanjun] seem a little uncomfortable.
0:14:24|0:14:26|The old lady gently tugged at the sleeve and said a few words.
0:14:28|0:14:34|Seeing the stubborn look of the old lady, [Chen Xuesong] didn't say anything, just kept rolling up his sleeves that were gradually slipping down.
0:14:34|0:14:37|Upon seeing the bottles and jars on the table, he couldn't help but say,
0:14:44|0:14:50|Seeing the old lady still sulking, [Chen Xuesong] helplessly turned around and sighed, then immediately spoke,
0:15:16|0:15:22|After listening to his daughter-in-law's difficulties, Cai Weihang's mother rubbed her hands nervously, lowered her head, unsure of what to say.
0:15:22|0:15:30|At this moment, [Chen Xuesong] picked up the bag beside him, took out several one hundred bills from the wallet, placed them on the edge of the bed, and then put the wallet back.
0:15:30|0:15:32|The old lady glanced and said, [Ma Dongmei].
0:15:39|0:15:45|Seeing the old lady's stubborn look, [Cai Weihang] felt helpless and didn't want to say anything more.
0:15:45|0:15:53|After a while, [Chen Xuesong] returned to the store and, exhausted both physically and mentally, he once again collapsed on the counter, completely unaware of his surroundings.
0:15:53|0:15:59|While [Wu Yanjun] in a floral shirt was sitting in front of the counter, he tilted his head to look at the sleeping face of the other person.
0:15:59|0:16:3|Later, he tucked the money under his arm, but [Chen Xuesong] was still fast asleep.
0:16:6|0:16:10|[Wu Yanjun]'s knocking on the counter glass scared [Chen Xuesong] into jumping up immediately.
0:16:10|0:16:15|He squinted for a moment, then picked up the money on the counter, opened the drawer and searched for change inside.
0:16:15|0:16:19|[Wu Yanjun] deliberately extended his arm, but [Chen Xuesong] lowered his head and asked.
0:16:37|0:16:41|He looked incredulous, but the other person kept staring at him and said.
0:16:43|0:16:46|A hint of confusion flickered in his eyes.
0:16:46|0:16:53|Later, he lowered his head and rummaged through the drawer for change, but his eyes were still fixed on the pine tree tattoo on [Wu Yanjun]'s arm.
0:17:14|0:17:19|[Chen Xuesong] glanced at the smiling [Wu Yanjun] across from him, then counted the change in his hand.
0:17:23|0:17:26|[Wu Yanjun] is still joking around in a non-serious manner.
0:17:26|0:17:31|[Chen Xuesong] picked up the newspaper next to him, slapped his arm with it, and then used it to fan himself.
0:17:31|0:17:35|He appeared angry on the surface, but a shy expression showed on his face.
0:17:35|0:17:38|The sky gradually darkens, while the temperature remains hot.
0:17:38|0:17:43|[Chen Xuesong] sat alone in front of the counter, his face and neck already wet with sweat.
0:17:43|0:17:47|The bread was piled up on half of the counter, with [Chen Xuesong] skillfully picking them up one by one and throwing them to the other side.
0:17:48|0:17:56|For some reason, [Cai Weihang] let out a soft sigh, then he started tapping on the calculator with his pen, calculating today's accounts.
0:17:56|0:18:4|The deafening sound of the motorcycle filled the air, at this moment, [Cai Weihang] dressed in a Chinese tunic and wearing a helmet, was riding the motorcycle forward.
0:18:4|0:18:8|The night scene on the street kept moving backwards as the car sped through one street after another.
0:18:8|0:18:10|Stopped in front of a large chess and card market.
0:18:12|0:18:15|In the distance, the sound of playing cards and singing opera could be heard.
0:18:15|0:18:22|He parked the car, took out a cigarette and put it in his mouth, then leisurely walked in.
0:18:22|0:18:25|The boss stood up from the chair and stopped him for his ID.
0:18:41|0:18:42|[Cai Weihang] took a puff of his cigarette and said to the boss.
0:18:55|0:18:58|After speaking, the boss pointed outside, indicating him to go back and get it.
0:18:58|0:19:8|[Cai Weihang] looked at the other person in disbelief, with the cigarette in his mouth. He then took out his wallet from his pocket, pulled out his ID card, and slammed it heavily on the boss's desk.
0:19:8|0:19:15|Seeing the angry face of [Cai Weihang], the boss smiled helplessly and shook his head, while [Cai Weihang] turned and went in search of a seat.
0:19:15|0:19:18|Before long, [Cai Weihang] was sitting in front of the computer screen with headphones on.
0:19:20|0:19:38|The words on the screen kept changing with the tapping of fingers. [Cai Weihang] was smoking, typing on the Tieba message board. The screen read, "Brother who lost his job, seeking maintenance. Brother's demands are not high, easier to take care of than a pretty boy, just asking for three meals a day, a monthly salary of eight thousand, with car pick-up and drop-off, of course not refusing."
0:19:38|0:19:54|Not long after posting, [Cai Weihang] received a very frivolous reply, which made him unable to help but laugh. He then took a drag on his cigarette, smiled broadly, and started typing on the keyboard again. Shortly after, he closed his own post and began browsing through the comments on other forums.
0:19:54|0:20:2|At this moment, a familiar name appeared in a post, titled "The woman who the real estate tycoon had the deepest feelings for in the past, [Chen Xuesong]".
0:20:2|0:20:7|[Cai Weihang] immediately clicked on it, wanting to see who this person with the same name and surname as his wife was.
0:20:7|0:20:13|The half-cut photo inside made him even more curious, and as he scrolled, his pupils gradually dilated.
0:20:14|0:20:21|This [Chen Xuesong] is not someone with the same name and surname. The woman with a youthful smile in the photo is his wife, [Chen Xuesong].
0:20:21|0:20:30|[Cai Weihang]'s face gradually turned serious. He immediately took the cigarette out of his mouth, looked around vigilantly at the people nearby, and his chest couldn't help but heave up and down.
0:20:33|0:20:39|At this moment, [Chen Xuesong] is sitting on the sofa watching TV, with knitting work in hand.
0:20:39|0:20:49|After a while, he seemed to hear footsteps, turned his head to look outside the door, and then [Chen Xuesong] put down what he was holding and walked to the corridor, coincidentally running into [Cai Weihang] walking in with a helmet in his hand.
0:20:49|0:20:54|She took the helmet and bag, turned around, and placed the helmet on the table.
0:20:54|0:20:57|[Cai Weihang] then took off his coat and entered the bathroom.
0:20:57|0:21:2|[Chen Xuesong] turned around, took out his phone from his bag, and glanced at [Cai Weihang] who was washing up.
0:21:2|0:21:8|She quickly flipped through the information inside, occasionally glancing back towards the direction of the restroom.
0:21:8|0:21:14|Looking at the phone with no suspicious messages, [Chen Xuesong] glanced at her husband who was brushing his teeth, then sat back on the sofa.
0:21:15|0:21:20|He then casually tossed his phone aside and ran his hand through his hair.
0:21:20|0:21:32|[Cai Weihang] took off his pants and threw them on the sofa. [Chen Xuesong] immediately reached out, took the clothes, laid them on the skin, and then took out his wallet from the pocket, took out his ID card and looked at it front and back.
0:21:32|0:21:37|While [Cai Weihang] was not out yet, he quickly tucked his ID card into his pocket and placed his wallet next to his phone.
0:21:39|0:21:42|After a while, [Cai Weihang] came out and sat on the sofa.
0:21:42|0:21:46|[Chen Xuesong] awkwardly looked up at the clock on the wall and said.
0:21:51|0:21:54|Cai Weihang picked up the remote control and turned on the TV again.
0:22:13|0:22:31|After speaking, [Chen Xuesong] turned and walked into the room. [Cai Weihang] lit a cigarette, took a deep drag, then picked up a magazine next to him. As he fanned the smoke and watched TV, he recalled the post he saw in the internet cafe, feeling extremely frustrated. Suddenly, [Cai Weihang] caught sight of his wife's phone on the sofa, causing him to pause.
0:22:31|0:22:42|Then he turned his head to look around the room, got up and took his phone, then turned his head to confirm again. He kept flipping through all the information inside, not knowing what he saw, and suddenly put down the magazine in his hand.
0:22:43|0:22:56|After staring at the phone screen for a long time, he turned his head to look around the room, then silently put the phone back in place and continued to fan himself with a magazine, still smoking incessantly.
0:22:56|0:23:3|The next morning, the patrol boat by the lake hummed, and there were scattered figures under the residential buildings.
0:23:3|0:23:8|In the house, [Chen Xuesong] is pouring milk, with a bowl of bread in front of him.
0:23:11|0:23:12|[Cai Weihang] sat down with a dissatisfied look on his face.
0:23:17|0:23:22|[Cai Weihang] didn't want to say anything more after listening, he tore open the plastic wrap of the bread and took a big bite.
0:23:22|0:23:29|[Chen Xuesong] sat on the side, supporting his head with his hand, smiling at [Cai Weihang], who furrowed his brows and struggled to swallow.
0:23:56|0:24:2|[Cai Weihang] glanced coldly at the bread before tossing it aside, then stood up and picked up his helmet.
0:24:2|0:24:8|[Chen Xuesong] looked puzzled with a mouthful of bread, as the other person walked away without even looking back.
0:24:8|0:24:11|He gave a disgruntled look and continued chewing on the bread in his mouth.
0:24:11|0:24:15|[Cai Weihang] walked out with his helmet and headed towards his motorcycle.
0:24:15|0:24:20|Not long after, her figure riding a motorcycle appeared on the bustling street.
0:24:20|0:24:24|[Cai Weihang] aimlessly looked at the streets on both sides, not knowing where to go.
0:24:24|0:24:29|At this moment, the scene shifts to the riverside, where the noisy sounds fill the entire dock.
0:24:29|0:24:37|[Cai Weihang] sat on a stool by the small pond, chewing on a youtiao. Suddenly, a girl hurriedly ran in front of his motorcycle.
0:25:0|0:25:11|[Cai Weihang] looked at the girl in surprise, then drove towards the direction of the old dock with her. He passed through the line of motorcycle drivers on both sides of the road and stopped in an empty space on the side. After the girl got off the car, she handed over five yuan.
0:25:20|0:25:26|After speaking, the girl ran over excitedly and pulled the boy standing aside away.
0:25:26|0:25:31|Suddenly, a group of motorcyclists started their engines and surrounded [Cai Weihang], who was standing still.
0:25:31|0:25:34|He, with a puzzled look, stared around with suspicious eyes.
0:25:34|0:25:38|At this moment, the leading driver stopped in front of him and issued a warning.
0:25:50|0:25:59|[Cai Weihang], with a cigarette in his mouth, glared fiercely at the person he was talking to. Suddenly, the sound of a roaring engine was heard, as he rode his motorcycle towards the person and started fighting with him.
0:25:59|0:26:13|The scene then shifts to a hospital, where [Cai Weihang], with an injured elbow, sits in a chair. Across from him, a female doctor is wrapping his wound with gauze and then securing it with tape. [Cai Weihang] is holding his arm and following the doctor's movements.
0:26:17|0:26:23|He bent his arm to pick up the helmet on his leg, then stood up, holding the toll receipt in his other hand, and walked out.
0:26:23|0:26:29|Upon arriving at the corridor, he carefully flipped through the old medical records, and then tucked the invoice inside.
0:26:29|0:26:31|In the shop at this moment, a couple is shopping.
0:26:53|0:26:56|[Chen Xuesong] sighed and picked up the newspaper on the counter.
0:26:56|0:27:0|She glanced at the news today and sighed.
0:27:29|0:27:32|The couple walked away without saying a word.
0:27:32|0:27:37|[Chen Xuesong] glanced back, only to catch a glimpse of [Wu Yanjun] touching his boot.
0:27:49|0:27:53|At this moment, [Cai Weihang] walked into the store, and [Wu Yanjun] came down from the counter to greet him.
0:27:56|0:28:0|[Wu Yanjun] finished speaking and turned towards the taxi, while [Cai Weihang] shouted at him.
0:28:21|0:28:37|[Cai Weihang] ignored his injured arm, raised it and pulled down the rolling shutter door. [Chen Xuesong] was also frightened by her furious husband and dared not move.
0:28:37|0:28:47|[Cai Weihang], who was in a bad mood, turned his back with his hands on his hips. The two of them stood still for a long time, then the couple closed the door and rode their motorcycle to the street.
0:28:47|0:28:55|[Cai Weihang] expressionlessly drives along the road, with [Wu Yanjun] sitting behind him, holding onto the back seat of the motorcycle and looking at the scenery on the road.
0:28:55|0:29:1|At the intersection, [Cai Weihang] seemed to have a purpose as he turned into a unfamiliar street.
0:29:7|0:29:12|[Cai Weihang] did not answer, with a serious face still looking straight ahead, and once again increased the force on the door.
0:29:14|0:29:17|The figures of [Cai Weihang] and [Wu Yanjun] grew smaller and smaller as the wheels kicked up more and more yellow dust.
0:29:17|0:29:22|After a while, [Cai Weihang] rode a motorcycle to a huge billboard.
0:29:22|0:29:24|Surrounding the area is a building under construction.
0:29:24|0:29:27|Before the car even came to a stop, [Chen Xuesong] was thrown out.
0:29:54|0:30:2|[Cai Weihang] was thoroughly enraged after hearing it.
0:30:2|0:30:7|[Chen Xuesong] shouted and cursed, [Cai Weihang] gritted his teeth and pushed [Chen Xuesong] into the garbage shed.
0:30:16|0:30:21|[Cai Weihang] withdrew one hand from his pants and used the other hand to lift up [Chen Xuesong]'s skirt and press down on it.
0:30:25|0:30:29|[Chen Xuesong] opened his mouth in pain, but no sound came out of his throat.
0:30:29|0:30:34|He gradually gave up struggling, allowing [Cai Weihang] to vent his anger on him.
0:30:34|0:30:40|After a while, [Chen Xuesong] let out a sigh, looked up at the sky, with a look of desolation and despair in his eyes.
0:30:40|0:30:47|At this moment, [Cai Weihang] gradually calmed down, his actions no longer as violent, but [Chen Xuesong] felt that his body had lost all sensation.
0:30:53|0:31:3|Not long after, the figure of [Chen Xuesong] appeared on the dusty road, he lowered his head and slowly walked forward, his two arms moving with his steps, swinging weakly.
0:31:3|0:31:10|At this moment, [Cai Weihang] rode up on a motorcycle and stopped beside him, but [Chen Xuesong] bypassed him and continued to walk forward with his head down.
0:31:10|0:31:16|[Cai Weihang] saw the situation, turned his head without saying a word, stayed in place for a while, then twisted the throttle and left alone.
0:31:17|0:31:29|The crane on the construction site is rotating and operating, with a few construction workers standing nearby. [Cai Weihang] rides a motorcycle and gradually disappears at the intersection, leaving only the disheveled [Chen Xuesong] walking alone on this deserted road.
0:31:31|0:31:39|[Chen Xuesong] didn't know how long he had been walking. The sweat marks on his neck had dried up, and the collar of his clothes was soaked with sweat.
0:31:39|0:31:43|He walked with his head down, silently passing through the cold underground passage.
0:31:43|0:31:47|A gust of wind blew in, making the wet clothes even colder.
0:31:47|0:31:51|[Chen Xuesong] couldn't help but rub his arms and continued to walk forward with his head down.
0:32:8|0:32:17|As a mother, [Chen Xuesong] arrived at the school gate on time, despite feeling distressed. She had already tidied up her hair and sat quietly in front of the flower bed.
0:32:17|0:32:21|At this moment, [Cai Weihang] rode his motorcycle to a stop in front of the school.
0:32:21|0:32:24|He looked around with a wandering gaze, occasionally observing his wife's expression. 
0:32:24|0:32:26|After much hesitation, he slowly walked over.
0:32:26|0:32:29|[Chen Xuesong] immediately stood up and walked away in the opposite direction.
0:32:29|0:32:33|[Cai Weihang] sighed helplessly as he watched him leave angrily.
0:32:33|0:32:35|Later, [Cai Weihang] took his daughter to a restaurant.
0:32:35|0:32:38|At this moment, he is on the phone with Boss Lin.
0:33:7|0:33:13|[Cai Weihang] was picking up food for his daughter while talking, but his daughter still crossed her arms and pouted, refusing to eat.
0:33:13|0:33:16|He then set down the plate in his hand and said to his daughter.
0:33:36|0:33:40|[Cai Weihang] turned his head at the sound, only to see [Chen Xuesong] walking up the stairs.
0:33:40|0:33:44|He glanced at the food on the table, put his bag aside, and sat down.
0:33:44|0:33:49|Yuan Yuan happily watched her mother sitting opposite, constantly stuffing food into her own mouth.
0:33:49|0:33:54|At this moment, [Cai Weihang] brought over a bowl of rice and considerately placed the chopsticks on top.
0:33:54|0:33:57|[Chen Xuesong] glanced at the rice, picked up the chopsticks and started eating.
0:33:58|0:34:3|The guilty [Cai Weihang] didn't know what to say, he just lowered his head and quietly ate his food.
0:34:3|0:34:10|He occasionally lifted his eyelids and secretly glanced at [Chen Xuesong], but the other party remained expressionless, as if nothing had happened.
0:34:10|0:34:17|[Chen Xuesong] had long noticed the stealing glances from [Cai Weihang], he held his breath, still unwilling to look him in the eye.
0:34:17|0:34:22|Later, [Chen Xuesong] scooped a mouthful of rice from the bowl and chewed slowly, but only he knew what was on his mind.
0:34:24|0:34:30|Early the next morning, as [Chen Xuesong] walked to the intersection, he heard the sound of a horn behind him.
0:34:30|0:34:35|He glanced back and continued walking forward, but was stopped by [Wu Yanjun].
0:34:35|0:34:41|[Wu Yanjun] sat in the car, smiling at him. [Chen Xuesong] hesitated for a moment, then walked towards the stopped taxi.
0:34:41|0:34:48|He didn't care about the eyes of others on the roadside, took the bag off his shoulder while walking, opened the passenger door, and sat in.
0:34:48|0:34:52|[Wu Yanjun] was also very surprised by his unusual behavior.
0:34:52|0:34:56|On the road, [Chen Xuesong] was feeling hot, so he rolled up the window and turned to [Wu Yanjun].
0:35:2|0:35:6|[Chen Xuesong] glanced down at his arm, showing a dissatisfied expression.
0:35:8|0:35:13|[Chen Xuesong] stared ahead, furrowing his brow, not saying a word.
0:35:16|0:35:22|[Chen Xuesong] still looked straight ahead, nodding at [Wu Yanjun].
0:35:22|0:35:25|Chen Xuesong gave him a glance and said.
0:35:27|0:35:31|Before long, [Wu Yanjun] arrived at the mysterious place he had mentioned, driving a taxi.
0:35:31|0:35:40|The sign by the roadside reads "Baisha Republic Style Street", with dilapidated billboards standing on the rooftops and the glass of the houses long shattered.
0:35:40|0:35:47|[Wu Yanjun] parked the car at the next turn, while [Chen Xuesong] looked out of the window with excitement. As they walked, [Wu Yanjun] turned and asked.
0:35:53|0:36:1|After speaking, [Chen Xuesong] looked elsewhere. A phone rang, and [Wu Yanjun] took out his phone from his pocket, glanced at it, and immediately hung up.
0:36:9|0:36:15|Seeing [Wu Yanjun] walking aimlessly, [Chen Xuesong] let out a soft sigh and continued walking ahead on his own.
0:36:15|0:36:17|Walking behind, [Wu Yanjun] smiled and caught up.
0:36:17|0:36:21|The surrounding Republican-style houses deeply attracted the gaze of [Chen Xuesong].
0:36:21|0:36:32|When they saw the sign of the grand theater, both Cai Weihang and Wu Yanjun stopped in their tracks involuntarily.
0:36:32|0:36:36|Facing the complaints from the delivery guy, [Cai Weihang] immediately walked up and opened the door.
0:36:39|0:36:44|The young man carried a box of beer into the store, Cai Weihang put away the keys and moved another box inside.
0:36:44|0:36:50|He then took out his phone, dialed [Chen Xuesong]'s number, and looked around with his eyes.
0:36:50|0:36:52|After realizing the call failed, he dialed again.
0:36:52|0:36:59|[Chen Xuesong], who was taking a walk at the moment, heard a phone ringing in his bag. He raised his hand, took out his phone and glanced at it, then silently pressed the hang-up button.
0:37:0|0:37:18|Before long, the phone rang again. Without hesitation, he hung up once more. Hearing [Chen Xuesong]'s phone ringing incessantly, [Wu Yanjun] took a few steps away and turned back to see [Chen Xuesong] holding the phone and looking into the distance, showing no intention of answering the call. [Chen Xuesong] gripped the phone tightly, turned his head away, and let the phone ring.
0:37:19|0:37:25|After a while, feeling agitated, he opened his phone and pressed the power button to turn it off, then stuffed it back into his bag.
0:37:25|0:37:29|[Wu Yanjun] looked at the angry [Chen Xuesong], feeling puzzled inside.
0:37:29|0:37:35|Ke Jing couldn't help but chuckle at the cute way [Chen Xuesong] was throwing a tantrum.
0:37:35|0:37:40|Later, the two walked into the abandoned grand theater, and the desolate scene inside was truly astonishing.
0:37:41|0:37:45|The concrete floor cracked in all directions, with the tiles on the roof appearing to be at risk of falling off at any moment.
0:37:45|0:37:51|On the dirty and messy stage, reflecting a ray of sunlight from outside the window, [Chen Xuesong] looked around with interest.
0:37:51|0:37:56|At this moment, [Wu Yanjun] quietly took [Chen Xuesong]'s hand and showed a shy smile.
0:38:1|0:38:11|After speaking, he moved [Wu Yanjun]'s hand away, turned his head to look out the window. [Wu Yanjun] looked a bit disappointed, glanced at him, then walked silently to the front.
0:38:11|0:38:22|[Chen Xuesong] looked at him in confusion, only to see [Wu Yanjun] speed up and take a few steps, then high-kick onto the stage. After standing up, he clapped his hands, then bent down to pick up a tree branch and slowly walked towards the center of the stage.
0:39:11|0:39:20|[Wu Yanjun] stood in the center of the stage, holding a branch and singing a heartfelt song. [Chen Xuesong] in the audience looked at him, tears welling up in his eyes for some unknown reason.
0:39:20|0:39:25|Perhaps he never expected that the romance he longed for would be given by a scruffy kid.
0:39:31|0:39:35|In the distance, the mountain peaks gradually emerge from the thick fog, with houses scattered across the slopes.
0:39:35|0:39:43|On the way back, [Cai Weihang] happily looked out the window, and the emotions that had been suppressed in his heart for the past few days seemed to have been relieved.
0:39:43|0:39:48|He occasionally turned his head to look at the driver, [Wu Yanjun], and quickly averted his gaze when caught.
0:39:48|0:39:55|[Wu Yanjun] looked at him and couldn't help but smile, while [Chen Xuesong] arrogantly stared straight ahead, but the corners of his mouth still revealed an uncontrollable smile.
0:39:57|0:40:3|At this moment, [Cai Weihang] is standing at the school gate waiting for his daughter to finish school. He was about to make a phone call, but stood frozen in place.
0:40:3|0:40:14|He looked into the distance with his neck stretched, his face instantly darkened. He saw [Chen Xuesong] open the door and get out of the car, while [Wu Yanjun] stood with both hands on the opposite car roof, waving and smiling.
0:40:24|0:40:29|Seeing her husband's cold and indifferent look, [Chen Xuesong] was furious.
0:40:52|0:41:0|The angry roar attracted the parents nearby, but [Chen Xuesong] pretended not to hear, [Cai Weihang] gave a disdainful glance, and walked off in the opposite direction in a huff.
0:41:13|0:41:22|[Cai Weihang] hesitated, but he had already boarded the bus bound for Chongqing. He leaned back against the seat, looking out the window with a sense of helplessness.
0:41:22|0:41:29|The urgent ringing of the phone in his pocket kept interrupting, but [Cai Weihang] stubbornly stared at the receding scenery without paying any attention.
0:41:29|0:41:35|Not long after, the scenery outside the window had changed from layers of baskets to an endless sky.
0:41:35|0:41:44|At this moment, [Cai Weihang] had already boarded the light rail to his destination. Despite his phone ringing constantly, he was captivated by the city scenery and paid no attention to it.
0:41:47|0:41:57|In the distance, skyscrapers stand tall, the streets are bustling with traffic, and the crowded people flow like tides. A crisp female voice from the light rail's broadcast reminds every passenger on board.
0:41:57|0:42:4|[Cai Weihang] regained his composure, glanced down at his phone, quickly pressed the end call button, and then turned his head to look out the window again.
0:42:4|0:42:13|The night gradually unfolds, with neon lights in the city intertwining with each other. [Cai Weihang] sits in a seat by the window, holding his head with his hand, quietly looking outside.
0:42:14|0:42:19|In his eyes at this moment, there was no longer a sense of novelty, only weariness left.
0:42:19|0:42:29|After getting off the train at the station, [Cai Weihang] took the escalator to the exit. As soon as he got down, he saw a homeless man lying on the ground, curled up and sleeping soundly while holding his legs.
0:42:29|0:42:39|Next to the trash can, an elderly man with mobility issues is struggling to dig out a bottle from it, while a farmer worker sits on the ground guarding a suitcase, nibbling on a pear in his hand, looking around blankly.
0:42:40|0:42:44|[Cai Weihang] walked out while observing everything around him.
0:42:44|0:42:51|A couple spread a newspaper on the ground and sat down, with the woman leaning against the man's chest, frowning and complaining to him from time to time.
0:42:51|0:42:56|The middle-aged aunt next to him is sitting on a wooden stool, earnestly shining shoes for people.
0:42:56|0:43:8|After a while, [Cai Weihang] got on the elevator heading to the destination. The elevator in the mall was transparent and spacious. [Cai Weihang] stood inside looking around, then turned around and grabbed the handrail, looking around everywhere.
0:43:8|0:43:14|Upon reaching the designated floor, as the elevator doors opened, [Cai Weihang] stepped out and was immediately captivated by the intricate carvings on the ceiling of the corridor.
0:43:28|0:43:34|Lin's furniture store is filled with furniture of various styles. When [Cai Weihang] sees it, his eyes light up.
0:43:34|0:43:39|He lovingly caressed the patterns on the chair, then sat down on the soft sample bed.
0:43:39|0:43:43|After sitting for a while, Cai Weihang was soon captivated by the intricate patterns at the foot of the bed.
0:43:43|0:43:48|He touched it with his fingers, then opened his palm and made a rough gesture.
0:43:48|0:43:54|The two then arrived at the nightclub, where the hostess across from them rested her head on [Boss Lin]'s shoulder, revealing a charming smile.
0:43:59|0:44:16|[Mr. Lin] handed over a book with elegant European style to [Cai Weihang], who put away the cigarette in his hand and flipped through it.
0:44:32|0:44:37|At this moment, [Chen Xuesong] was still constantly calling [Cai Weihang], but the other party still didn't answer.
0:44:37|0:44:43|Beside, the daughter had fallen asleep, [Chen Xuesong] was extremely worried and decided to look around nearby.
0:44:43|0:44:49|Most of the shops on the street have already closed, with a few shop owners packing up and getting ready to close their stores.
0:44:53|0:44:57|[Chen Xuesong] left disappointed after hearing, then continued to walk elsewhere.
0:44:57|0:45:3|Before long, the tea plantation also closed for the day, shutting its gates, and the lights on the road grew dimmer and dimmer.
0:45:3|0:45:8|The dimly lit night road made him feel scared, [Chen Xuesong] occasionally looked back at the empty space behind him.
0:45:10|0:45:18|Not long after, he arrived at the factory where [Cai Weihang] used to work, with a large iron padlock hanging on the gate, but with a gap large enough for one person to pass through.
0:45:18|0:45:24|[Chen Xuesong] sneaked in with a hunched back. Just as he approached the doorway, he heard the clattering sound of mahjong tiles inside.
0:45:24|0:45:32|[Chen Xuesong] walked inside and found that the seal on the door had been torn off. There were many cardboard boxes on the floor, each with a seal on it.
0:45:32|0:45:36|He stood outside and looked around, then followed the sound into the house.
0:45:37|0:45:41|Upon entering, [Chen Xuesong] immediately walked over to the big sister who was opening the door and asked, "Cai Weihang, Wu Yanjun, how are you?"
0:46:0|0:46:8|The neighbor's joke, though, sounded particularly harsh to [Chen Xuesong], who turned around and looked at the tables next door, but did not see her husband.
0:46:8|0:46:14|At this moment, [Cai Weihang] in Chongqing hurriedly ran into the rear hall.
0:46:14|0:46:23|[Cai Weihang] helplessly glanced at the ticket seller, picked up the bag in his hand and walked out, then turned back to look at the departure time table on the wall.
0:46:23|0:46:43|Opening her phone to check the time, [Cai Weihang] instead finds 19 missed calls from [Chen Xuesong]. She hesitates for a moment before putting the phone back with a stern face, then quickly walks towards the ticket office.
0:46:43|0:46:49|[Cai Weihang] lowered his head and quickly passed by the advertisements for the aunties' guesthouse, arriving at the deserted street.
0:46:49|0:46:54|[Cai Weihang] hurriedly walked up the stairs, slinging the bag behind her back as she walked away into the distance.
0:46:54|0:47:8|On the street, a few taxis with illuminated signs were still waiting. After a while, she dragged her tired body into a hotel and inquired at the front desk.
0:47:8|0:47:17|The girl at the front desk nervously flipped through the documents in her hand, [Cai Weihang] placed the bag on the counter, freeing up his hands to take out his wallet from his pocket.
0:47:17|0:47:24|She searched inside, but couldn't find her ID card. She raised her hand and touched the pockets on both sides, but still nothing.
0:47:24|0:47:27|She immediately picked up her phone in a fit of anger and dialed a number.
0:47:43|0:47:47|[Cai Weihang] angrily hung up the phone, firming his decision not to go back home.
0:47:47|0:47:50|He turned around and walked towards the stage, awkwardly rubbing his hands.
0:47:56|0:48:0|She suppressed her anger, helplessly put away the wallet, took the bag and turned to walk outside.
0:48:10|0:48:18|[Cai Weihang] turned his head to look at the sofa in the hall, hesitated for a moment, but soon he was already lying on the sofa, making a lot of noise.
0:48:18|0:48:27|[Cai Weihang] was seen with one hand resting on the sofa, covered with a thin sheet, ending a day of exhaustion in a disheveled manner.
0:48:27|0:48:33|Early the next morning, he returned home with a backpack. Sitting on the bed, [Chen Xuesong] saw his figure in the mirror and immediately looked towards the door.
0:48:34|0:48:37|[Cai Weihang] stood at the door, paused for a moment, and then walked in.
0:48:37|0:48:45|[Chen Xuesong] stared at him intently, but he pretended not to see and threw the bag onto the bed. He took off his shirt and lay down.
0:48:45|0:48:48|Chen Xuesong looked at his tired appearance and asked, "[Cai Weihang], are you okay?"
0:49:2|0:49:6|[Cai Weihang] finished speaking and took out his wallet from his pocket, looking annoyed.
0:49:6|0:49:10|He took out the remaining money and threw it at [Chen Xuesong].
0:49:10|0:49:13|After speaking, he stood up and sat on the edge of the bed with his back turned.
0:49:13|0:49:17|[Chen Xuesong] gave an angry glance and then picked up the money on the bed to count.
0:49:17|0:49:24|At this moment, Cai Weihang's phone rings.
0:49:32|0:49:40|[Chen Xuesong] was still in doubt at this moment. Before long, [Cai Weihang] appeared among the shimmering wine glasses, reaching out to offer a cigarette.
0:49:56|0:50:2|Beside him, his brothers spoke kindly to him. [Cai Weihang] smiled and clinked glasses with them, then frowned as he drank it down.
0:50:2|0:50:4|At this moment, the factory manager said to [Cai Weihang].
0:51:5|0:51:14|Master, [Cai Weihang] heard what the factory director said, his face instantly changed. He helplessly lowered his head and threw the crumpled paper in his hand onto the table.
0:51:14|0:51:19|Speechless, the drunken [Cai Weihang] was supported out by his colleagues, and he angrily cursed.
0:51:26|0:51:31|[Chen Xuesong] hurried over and stopped [Cai Weihang].
0:51:49|0:51:53|[Cai Weihang] shook off [Chen Xuesong] and ran towards home like crazy.
0:51:53|0:51:58|[Chen Xuesong] steadied himself and followed, only to see [Cai Weihang] rushing out with a kitchen knife.
0:52:5|0:52:9|[Chen Xuesong] peeked out anxiously and then quickly locked the door before catching up.
0:52:17|0:52:17|Chang Chang has already returned to her son's home in Chongqing.
0:52:18|0:52:20|Cai Weihang from the movie "Three-Nine Wind" shouted and waved a kitchen knife wildly.
0:52:31|0:52:33|[Cai Weihang] picked up a kitchen knife and chopped at the tree trunk.
0:53:2|0:53:12|[Chen Xuesong], who had not slept all night, sat in the shop the next morning with swollen eyes. He furrowed his brow as if pondering something, occasionally looking down at the phone beside him, his face filled with indecision.
0:53:12|0:53:22|After a while, [Chen Xuesong]'s eyes suddenly became determined. He took out his phone from the drawer, dialed a number, and stared at the screen, hesitating to make the call.
0:53:23|0:53:28|Later, [Chen Xuesong] glanced around before pressing the dial button and putting the phone to his ear.
0:53:33|0:53:38|After waiting for a few seconds, he held the phone in one hand and anxiously searched for a pen and paper with the other.
0:53:38|0:53:43|In a moment of urgency, he picked up the newspaper beside him and started recording the information from the phone call incessantly.
0:53:44|0:53:50|Later, [Chen Xuesong] walked quietly along the back of the shelves, holding a phone number written on a newspaper.
0:53:50|0:53:56|He kept looking back, made sure no one was around, and immediately dialed the phone number of Ji Jiang Real Estate Company.
0:54:21|0:54:26|After finishing the call, [Chen Xuesong] hung up the phone with a sense of relief, but for some reason, he felt guilty.
0:54:26|0:54:35|In the afternoon, [Chen Xuesong] walked into a real estate company. He had long hair and was wearing a floral dress he used to wear when he was young, a stark contrast to his usual attire.
0:54:35|0:54:43|He smoothed his hair and slowly walked up the stairs, the anxiety in [Chen Xuesong]'s heart growing stronger with each step.
0:54:59|0:55:3|After speaking, he took off his gloves for playing ball and sat opposite [Chen Xuesong].
0:55:16|0:55:25|[Chen Xuesong] said nothing, kept looking at [Yang Jiucheng], opened his mouth but didn't know how to speak, then looked embarrassed and lowered his head.
0:55:25|0:55:32|In the evening, [Chen Xuesong] sat at the table, calmly picking up the newspaper placed on the table, only to see a dozen neatly arranged banknotes scattered in front of him.
0:55:49|0:55:54|Watching [Chen Xuesong] pretending to be relaxed, [Cai Weihang] remained silent and quietly lowered his head.
0:55:54|0:56:0|He never expected that his wife would actually go to borrow money from their old fellow villager for herself.
0:56:0|0:56:7|Cai Weihang knows in his heart that his wife's humble request for money from Yang Jiu Cheng is for the sake of his own business.
0:56:7|0:56:12|But the thought that he had once humiliated his wife because of Yang Jiucheng made him feel even worse.
0:56:13|0:56:17|At night, [Chen Xuesong] lay on the bed, unable to sleep, thinking about the events of the day.
0:56:17|0:56:24|At this moment, [Cai Weihang], who was sleeping on the other side, gently put down the legs of his daughter resting on his body, and then slowly turned over.
0:56:24|0:56:27|[Chen Xuesong] heard movement behind him and immediately closed his eyes to pretend to be asleep.
0:56:33|0:56:39|He persistently patted [Chen Xuesong]'s shoulder, but the other person turned his whole body away, unwilling to pay attention to him.
0:56:39|0:56:45|[Cai Weihang] paused with his hand in midair, unsure of how to ease the grievances in his wife's heart.
0:56:45|0:56:52|At this moment, [Chen Xuesong] felt a mess in his head, recalling the embarrassment of borrowing money and feeling both helpless and ashamed.
0:56:52|0:56:58|At this moment, [Cai Weihang] sat up and moved his sleeping daughter aside, then lay down slowly next to his wife.
0:57:4|0:57:8|The tension between the couple in recent days seems to have thawed at this moment. [Cai Weihang] and [Wu Yanjun].
0:57:8|0:57:12|[Chen Xuesong] sighed deeply, tears welled up in his eyes.
0:57:12|0:57:16|Early the next morning, [Cai Weihang] arrived at his sister's printing shop.
0:57:32|0:57:36|The younger sister took a sip of water and put down the cup.
0:57:36|0:57:42|Seeing his sister's indifferent attitude, [Cai Weihang] said discontentedly.
0:57:42|0:57:44|Little sister gave a disdainful look and said.
0:57:58|0:58:1|[Cai Weihang] angrily slammed the pen on the table after being hit in a sore spot.
0:58:1|0:58:5|The younger sister stood up and said to the [waiter] next to her.
0:58:5|0:58:8|[Buddy] Upon hearing these words, immediately got up and walked out.
0:58:8|0:58:12|[Cai Weihang] sat there with a dark expression, wondering what tricks his sister was up to.
0:58:12|0:58:17|The younger sister walked to the door, pulled a chair and sat next to [Cai Weihang].
0:58:17|0:58:19|She leaned on the table and said earnestly.
0:58:34|0:58:40|[Cai Weihang] picked up a lighter, lit the cigarette in his mouth, and then twisted his head to the other side.
0:58:44|0:58:49|Upon hearing this, [Cai Weihang], who was originally indifferent, stared at his sister with wide eyes.
0:58:49|0:58:53|He looked at his sister incredulously, but started to doubt in his heart.
0:58:53|0:59:1|After leaving the store, [Cai Weihang] rode a motorcycle alone to a housing area right next to the train station. He held a cigarette in his hand, but had no mood to smoke.
0:59:1|0:59:6|The train roared past him, but [Cai Weihang]'s mind was still on the words his sister had said.
0:59:6|0:59:10|After returning home, [Cai Weihang] was completely devastated.
0:59:10|0:59:16|He sat in front of the table with messy hair, staring blankly at the 150,000 cash in front of him.
0:59:16|0:59:21|The next morning, the opening ceremony of [Cai Weihang] went smoothly, and everyone gathered together in the hotel.
0:59:25|0:59:28|[Chen Xuesong] smiled and handed a few pieces of candy to Yuan Yuan.
0:59:28|0:59:32|At this moment, several people suddenly entered from outside the door, holding a signboard.
0:59:32|0:59:35|He stood up with a smile and looked at the plaque with the four prosperous characters on it.
0:59:38|0:59:40|His face changed instantly.
0:59:40|0:59:43|[Chen Xuesong] sat down with a bewildered look, his expression becoming increasingly nervous.
0:59:44|0:59:48|He secretly glanced around at the people, feeling extremely uneasy.
0:59:48|0:59:51|Not long after, he stood up and quickly walked towards the direction of the restroom.
0:59:51|0:59:59|[Cai Weihang] turned his head and listened as his colleague at the next table complained bitterly to his friend.
0:59:59|1:0:2|[Cai Weihang] took a cigarette and walked outside.
1:0:2|1:0:9|A worker moving things on the side greeted cheerfully, as Yuan Yuan pulled [Chen Xuesong] to the flower basket and turned around.
1:0:32|1:0:40|Cai Weihang stood in the distance, looking at the round and cute face, then looked up at [Chen Xuesong].
1:0:44|1:0:48|Yuan Yuan, with a naive and innocent look, held a small flower in her hand and couldn't help but smell it.
1:0:48|1:0:52|Cai Weihang stared at Yuanyuan for a long time, feeling more and more uneasy as he looked.
1:0:52|1:1:1|He turned around, touched his face and nose, and remembered what his sister had said. He couldn't help but start to doubt whether Yuan Yuan was his biological daughter.
1:1:2|1:1:8|At night, [Wu Yanjun] is waiting outside a health club, while his friends are busy washing cars on the side.
1:1:8|1:1:11|At this moment, a car drove up and stopped in front of the health care center.
1:1:11|1:1:18|Driven by curiosity, he turned to look at the person getting off the car, only to see that it was Cai Weihang who stepped out after the door opened.
1:1:21|1:1:25|Wu Yanjun looked at Cai Weihang, who was beaming with joy, with a hint of disbelief.
1:1:25|1:1:29|He turned back uncertainly and took another look to confirm that he wasn't mistaken.
1:1:29|1:1:34|Wu Yanjun took a puff of the cigarette in his hand, his expression turning serious as if contemplating something.
1:1:34|1:1:38|Later, he took out his phone from his pocket and his fingers kept tapping on the screen.
1:1:38|1:1:43|After hesitating for a few seconds, he pressed the dial button and put the phone to his ear, waiting for the call to be answered.
1:1:48|1:1:52|[Chen Xuesong] walked in, glanced around the surroundings, and sat down on a chair in the lobby.
1:1:52|1:2:0|He kept turning his head to look down the corridor, hoping to catch a glimpse of [Cai Weihang].
1:2:3|1:2:9|At this moment, a girl in a strapless dress walked in despite the security guard's obstruction, with a look of anger on her face.
1:2:9|1:2:13|[Chen Xuesong] curiously looked at the girl sitting next to him, only to be given a cold glance by her.
1:2:13|1:2:18|Later, the two leaned back in their chairs, waiting for their target individuals.
1:2:18|1:2:24|At this moment, [Cai Weihang] was led out by a beautiful woman. He walked out while pushing away the woman's hand.
1:2:24|1:2:29|Boss Lin smiled and stuck close to the beauty, following behind him.
1:2:38|1:2:43|[Chen Xuesong] looked at [Cai Weihang] heading to the checkout counter, and his mind buzzed.
1:2:43|1:2:47|At this moment, the girl in suspenders rushed up and threw punches at Boss Lin.
1:3:2|1:3:7|The disheveled Cai Weihang was about to go out to check on Boss Lin's situation, but turned around to see Chen Xuesong standing still.
1:3:13|1:3:19|Cai Weihang left Chen Xuesong behind and ran out alone, only to see Boss Lin walking away with the girl in suspenders.
1:3:19|1:3:23|[Cai Weihang] stood there with a vacant look in his eyes, starting to worry about his business.
1:3:23|1:3:28|He turned around and looked at [Chen Xuesong] in the hall with a displeased expression, putting his hands in his pockets.
1:3:28|1:3:36|Not long after, [Chen Xuesong] walked out with his wallet. He stared at [Cai Weihang] at the door for a long time, then turned around and walked silently towards the street.
1:3:36|1:3:40|His face was pale, expressionless, as if his heart had turned into a stagnant pool.
1:3:41|1:3:48|Cai Weihang felt that his wife was being unreasonable at the moment, he glanced irritably at the meddling [Chen Xuesong], and then followed up to complain.
1:4:7|1:4:13|Seeing her husband's self-righteous look, [Chen Xuesong] looked at him with big eyes, tears welling up in her eyes. She turned her head and said angrily.
1:4:15|1:4:18|Cai Weihang hurriedly caught up with her and explained when he saw her like this.
1:4:35|1:4:41|[Chen Xuesong] listened to these words, glared at Cai Weihang, angrily ran to the side of the road, closed his eyes tightly, and let out a long sigh.
1:4:41|1:4:52|Shortly after, [Chen Xuesong] looked around and suddenly saw Wu Yanjun's car parked not far away. He quickly ran to the car and both of them didn't say a word after getting in.
1:4:59|1:5:6|Seeing the distressed look on [Chen Xuesong], Wu Yanjun couldn't help but blame himself. He looked at [Chen Xuesong] with heartache, not knowing how to comfort her.
1:5:6|1:5:8|He then asked.
1:5:8|1:5:12|[Chen Xuesong] stared straight ahead and thought for a moment before answering.
1:5:12|1:5:27|Next, the two of them arrived at an internet cafe. Wu Yanjun found the post about [Chen Xuesong] and Yang Jiucheng on Tieba, with a photo of himself sitting next to Yang Jiucheng. [Chen Xuesong] stared at the so-called verification photo in the post, Wu Yanjun couldn't bear to watch and immediately shut down the computer.
1:5:28|1:5:42|Later, the two of them returned to the car, with [Chen Xuesong] sitting silently in the passenger seat.
1:5:45|1:5:51|As a mother, leaving her daughter alone at home, she feels deeply helpless and self-blaming.
1:5:51|1:5:56|The pent-up grievances in the heart burst out at this moment, and tears gushed out like digging into the ground.
1:5:57|1:6:1|Seeing [Chen Xuesong] in tears, [Wu Yanjun] felt at a loss.
1:6:1|1:6:6|He gently patted [Chen Xuesong]'s shoulder, but unexpectedly, the latter cried even harder.
1:6:6|1:6:10|Later, he reached out his hand and pulled [Chen Xuesong] into his arms.
1:6:10|1:6:16|[Chen Xuesong]'s fragile heart found solace in this moment, as he leaned on [Wu Yanjun]'s shoulder and burst into tears without reservation.
1:6:22|1:6:29|[Wu Yanjun] gently reached out and touched his shoulder, while [Chen Xuesong] tried hard to control his emotions but couldn't help but sob softly.
1:6:29|1:6:37|After a while, [Cai Weihang] wiped away his tears, sat up, lowered his head, calmed down, and looked out the car window with tears in his eyes.
1:6:37|1:6:40|At this moment, he suddenly stopped sobbing and silently looked outside.
1:6:40|1:6:46|[Wu Yanjun] also turned his head and saw [Cai Weihang] walking briskly towards home with a key in his hand.
1:6:46|1:6:51|Chen Xuesong's heart was filled with anger again as he glared fiercely at Cai Weihang's back.
1:6:51|1:6:53|[Wu Yanjun] was also watching with indignation.
1:6:53|1:6:57|At this moment, [Chen Xuesong] suddenly turned around and cupped his face.
1:6:57|1:7:2|Unprepared, [Wu Yanjun] was suddenly kissed by [Chen Xuesong] before he could react.
1:7:2|1:7:6|[Chen Xuesong] clung tightly to [Wu Yanjun]'s neck, as if venting the anger in his heart.
1:7:6|1:7:9|[Wu Yanjun] reached out his arm and tightly embraced his back.
1:7:10|1:7:15|Suddenly, [Chen Xuesong] cried and pushed away the reluctant [Wu Yanjun], then immediately got off the car.
1:7:15|1:7:18|Sitting in the car, [Wu Yanjun] stared blankly at the departing figure of [Chen Xuesong].
1:7:28|1:7:40|At this moment, [Cai Weihang] came to the hotel alone and opened a room. She sat dejectedly on the bed, recalling everything that had happened today - her husband's lack of understanding and trust, becoming a thorn in [Cai Weihang]'s heart.
1:7:40|1:7:46|What's even more disappointing to her is that, even if she swallowed her pride to borrow money from Yang Jiu Cheng, this is the result she got.
1:7:53|1:7:58|Yuan Yuan was already sound asleep on the sofa, while [Cai Weihang] gently stroked her little feet.
1:7:58|1:8:7|At this moment, the TV is playing the wedding video of her and [Chen Xuesong]. Sitting on the sofa, [Cai Weihang] smiles as she enjoys the beautiful memories of the past, her eyes inexplicably moistening.
1:8:9|1:8:14|In the video tape, [Chen Xuesong] in a wedding dress is filled with a happy smile.
1:8:32|1:8:36|Early the next morning, [Wu Yanjun] was in a taxi, wiping the rearview mirror with a cloth.
1:8:37|1:8:44|Suddenly, the car door was opened, and he turned around in confusion, only to see [Cai Weihang] sitting angrily in the passenger seat.
1:8:48|1:8:59|Cai Weihang and Wu Yanjun arrived at a remote path, where a cement truck rumbled past their taxi. The already muddy road was further crushed by the wheels, sinking deep into the mud and water.
1:8:59|1:9:3|In front of them, the lake was shrouded in a thin mist, and [Wu Yanjun] parked the car by the shore.
1:9:3|1:9:9|After getting out of the car driven by [Cai Weihang], who was sitting in the passenger seat, he walked to the other side, opened the door, and then headed towards the lake.
1:9:9|1:9:13|Sitting in the car, [Wu Yanjun] looked puzzled at the unusual behavior of [Cai Weihang].
1:9:13|1:9:17|He got out of the car slowly and closed the door heavily.
1:9:17|1:9:19|He then strode towards the back of Cai Weihang.
1:9:47|1:9:58|Seeing [Wu Yanjun] looking indifferent, [Cai Weihang] instantly got angry. He walked over, glared at [Wu Yanjun], and gritted his teeth, saying.
1:9:58|1:10:6|Seeing [Wu Yanjun] showing no signs of backing down, [Cai Weihang] was momentarily stunned, but soon after, more anger kept surging into his heart.
1:10:6|1:10:8|He looked [Wu Yanjun] up and down and said.
1:10:26|1:10:29|[Cai Weihang] grabbed [Wu Yanjun] by the collar and pushed him backwards.
1:10:29|1:10:33|[Wu Yanjun] stood still, with a provocative expression on his face.
1:10:33|1:10:37|Suddenly, [Cai Weihang] reached out and began to slap himself wildly.
1:10:37|1:10:39|He fans himself as he walks away.
1:10:39|1:10:45|He then collapsed, kneeling helplessly on the ground, fists clenched tightly, pounding the ground heavily.
1:10:45|1:10:49|The inner discontent and pain are fiercely tormenting the already humble heart.
1:10:58|1:11:3|Cai Weihang's wailing echoed in the ears, while [Wu Yanjun]'s eyes became even more determined.
1:11:3|1:11:7|Upon returning home, [Cai Weihang] was cooking when a knock on the door was heard.
1:11:26|1:11:32|[Cai Weihang] hid behind the door frame, watching the back of the police officer, his mind also starting to wonder what [Chen Xuesong] had done.
1:11:53|1:12:0|At this moment, [Cai Weihang] ran out of breath and stood outside the door.
1:12:0|1:12:7|[Cai Weihang] glanced determinedly at the police officer, then turned to look at [Chen Xuesong] sitting inside, before excitedly turning away.
1:12:17|1:12:25|After the two came out of the police station, [Cai Weihang] became more suspicious, while [Chen Xuesong] remained silent and walked ahead. Unable to hold back, [Cai Weihang] asked,
1:12:35|1:12:40|Listening to the skeptical tone of [Cai Weihang], [Chen Xuesong] didn't want to explain anymore. He immediately said,
1:12:48|1:12:53|[Cai Weihang] glanced at the sarcastic [Chen Xuesong], then turned his head to the other side and left in anger.
1:12:53|1:12:57|He walked halfway, then turned back to stand in front of [Chen Xuesong].
1:13:15|1:13:20|[Chen Xuesong] can no longer bear [Cai Weihang]'s suspicions and is forced to speak sarcastically.
1:13:20|1:13:25|He stared defiantly at [Cai Weihang], his eyes flashing with an uncontrollable anger.
1:13:25|1:13:30|[Cai Weihang] looked at [Chen Xuesong]'s stubborn look and didn't want to say anything more, then turned around and left immediately.
1:13:31|1:13:36|Behind him, [Chen Xuesong] watched her husband walk away, tears flowing uncontrollably.
1:13:36|1:13:42|Early the next morning, [Chen Xuesong] sat at the supermarket entrance knitting a sweater, when suddenly he heard the sound of a car door closing next to him.
1:13:42|1:13:45|She turned her head and saw [Wu Yanjun] walking towards her.
1:13:45|1:13:48|[Chen Xuesong] ignored it and continued knitting the sweater.
1:13:48|1:13:53|[Wu Yanjun] walked over and sat on the bench next to him. She bent down and stared straight at [Chen Xuesong].
1:13:57|1:14:3|[Chen Xuesong] looked up when he heard it, waiting for [Wu Yanjun] to announce today's news, but the latter just stared at her without saying a word.
1:14:4|1:14:6|After speaking, he started sewing again with the needle and thread in his hand.
1:14:9|1:14:18|Upon hearing this, [Chen Xuesong]'s hands paused in knitting, he didn't know what [Wu Yanjun] meant by "showing cards", nor did he know what [Cai Weihang] had told him.
1:14:18|1:14:21|He then looked at [Wu Yanjun] in confusion.
1:14:22|1:14:28|After hearing this sentence, [Chen Xuesong] suddenly understood something, but he was unwilling to believe it, thinking that [Wu Yanjun] was joking.
1:14:29|1:14:35|After rejecting [Wu Yanjun], he no longer had the mood to knit. He tidied up the needles and threads in his arms, then walked towards the counter.
1:14:41|1:14:44|[Wu Yanjun] placed both hands on the counter, waiting for an answer.
1:14:44|1:14:50|[Chen Xuesong] lowered his head without saying a word, silently shook his head, and when he saw the other person still not leaving, he shook his head again.
1:14:53|1:14:57|[Chen Xuesong] still dared not look up, nor did he want to give an answer.
1:14:57|1:15:3|[Wu Yanjun]'s sudden temper scared [Chen Xuesong], who furrowed his brow and raised his head, unsure how to deal with it.
1:15:6|1:15:14|After being rejected once again, [Wu Yanjun]'s face instantly changed. The affectionate eyes that were only for [Chen Xuesong] now turned as cold as an ice cellar.
1:15:14|1:15:17|He looked angrily at [Chen Xuesong], and then felt ridiculous himself.
1:15:18|1:15:30|[Wu Yanjun] slowly bent down, propping his arms on the counter, recalling the passionate kiss with [Chen Xuesong] in the car that day. At this moment, he finally realized that it was all just his own wishful thinking.
1:15:30|1:15:35|[Cai Weihang] saw [Wu Yanjun] get into the car without looking back, stepped on the gas pedal, and drove away in the taxi.
1:15:39|1:15:44|[Chen Xuesong] stood still with his head down, listening to the sound of [Wu Yanjun] driving away.
1:15:44|1:15:48|The restrained [Chen Xuesong] finally burst into tears, but quickly stopped himself.
1:15:48|1:15:52|In the afternoon, [Cai Weihang] waited for her daughter at the kindergarten gate as usual.
1:16:3|1:16:18|[Chen Xuesong] smiled and bid farewell to the teacher, then immediately took out his phone to call [Cai Weihang]. Just as he was about to speak, the call was abruptly ended by the other party. Perplexed, he looked at his phone, not knowing what antics [Cai Weihang] was up to. Helpless, [Chen Xuesong] stood at the school gate.
1:16:20|1:16:24|At this moment, [Cai Weihang] sat expressionless on a bus.
1:16:24|1:16:28|Beside him, [Wu Yanjun] excitedly looks out the window at the scenery, revealing a sweet smile.
1:16:28|1:16:32|[Cai Weihang], with a heavy heart, closed his eyes and fell into a deep sleep on the back of the chair.
1:16:32|1:16:36|Before long, [Cai Weihang] was already holding Yuanyuan, sitting in the lobby of a hospital.
1:16:36|1:16:40|The family of three sitting on the chair next to him caught the attention of [Cai Weihang].
1:16:43|1:16:48|[Cai Weihang] glanced at the number ticket in his hand, then picked up the briefcase next to him and took out his wallet from it.
1:16:48|1:16:54|He then stood up and walked over, sitting on the chair at the consultation desk.
1:17:4|1:17:9|[Cai Weihang] took the list from the nurse and stood up to pay, but his eyes were fixed anxiously on [Yuanyuan].
1:17:9|1:17:12|[Yuanyuan] sat on the chair, turning her big eyes to look at her father.
1:17:12|1:17:16|After dad walked away, [Yuan Yuan] immediately took out her phone from her bag.
1:17:16|1:17:22|She skillfully found her mother's phone number, then put the phone to her ear, waiting quietly. 
1:17:38|1:17:40|Soon after, [Cai Weihang] and [Wu Yanjun] arrived at the paternity testing center.
1:17:40|1:17:44|[Cai Weihang] with his head tilted appeared in the lens of the camera.
1:17:44|1:17:46|Beside, [Wu Yanjun] sat obediently on the chair.
1:17:46|1:17:50|After the photo shoot, [Cai Weihang] walked to the blood collection center holding Round's hand.
1:17:50|1:17:54|The nurse, wearing gloves, is disinfecting the round fingers.
1:17:54|1:17:57|[Cai Weihang] couldn't help but worry as he looked at the cotton swab in the nurse's hand.
1:18:4|1:18:8|Seeing his daughter's frightened look, [Cai Weihang]'s heart suddenly ached.
1:18:8|1:18:13|When he turned back to look at the nurse again, he suddenly pulled his round hand back.
1:18:16|1:18:19|[Cai Weihang] lowered his head, looking at Yuanyuan with a heartache.
1:18:19|1:18:25|At this moment, [Cai Weihang] is sitting on the sofa at home, waiting.
1:18:25|1:18:30|Yuan Yuan ran into the room, tightly hugged [Chen Xuesong]'s neck, and then took out the doll in her hand.
1:18:34|1:18:40|[Chen Xuesong] patted the round head, at this moment [Cai Weihang] walked in cautiously and looked at [Chen Xuesong].
1:18:44|1:18:49|Yuan Yuan looked at her mother's unhappy expression, pouted, but still obediently put down the doll and ran out.
1:18:50|1:18:55|Cai Weihang walked in with his head down, like a child who had done something wrong, not daring to look directly at [Chen Xuesong].
1:18:55|1:18:59|He bent down to put down what he was holding and sat on the sofa, his eyes darting around.
1:18:59|1:19:4|After a while, he looked up at [Chen Xuesong] with a somewhat nervous expression.
1:19:4|1:19:8|[Chen Xuesong] supported his hands on his legs, turned his head to the other side, and said.
1:19:11|1:19:15|[Chen Xuesong] finished speaking with a pretense of calmness, then turned his face to the other side.
1:19:15|1:19:18|Cai Weihang's eyes widened instantly upon hearing these words.
1:19:18|1:19:21|He looked at [Chen Xuesong] in a panic, regretting in his heart.
1:19:26|1:19:33|Sitting across from him, [Chen Xuesong] did not respond. He slowly picked up the bag on the table, pulled up the luggage that had been prepared long ago, and got up to walk out.
1:19:52|1:20:7|[Chen Xuesong] repeatedly tried to snatch the suitcase from [Cai Weihang], but was blocked by [Cai Weihang] each time. Unable to retrieve the suitcase, he stubbornly shook off [Cai Weihang]'s hand, then dropped the suitcase and walked out, leaving the small house where the couple had lived for many years.
1:20:7|1:20:11|Soon, his figure disappeared at the end of the corridor.
1:20:11|1:20:15|[Cai Weihang] paused for a moment in place, immediately dropped the suitcase in his hand, and quickly chased after.
