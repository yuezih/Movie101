0:1:4|0:1:6|The morning sun shines on the lake, sparkling on the water.
0:1:7|0:1:12|A swordsman appears above the valley, his fingers lightly gripping the sword handle.
0:1:12|0:1:18|Facing him stood a swordsman, with narrow eyes that seemed melancholic, yet the killing intent in his eyes was particularly evident.
0:1:18|0:1:22|Both [Ouyang Feng] and [Murong Yan] drew their swords at the same time, and the valley was instantly filled with swirling dust.
0:1:22|0:1:31|Their figures moved like wandering dragons, with only the sounds of fighting in their ears but no visible actions, their speed was extremely fast, and a round ended quickly.
0:1:31|0:1:44|At this moment, the swordsman has sheathed his weapon, and the warrior he was facing slowly opens his narrowed eyes. The red-faced river at the foot of the mountain continues to flow, shimmering as if nothing has happened.
0:1:44|0:1:51|The scene shifts, and a swordsman is seen holding a long sword, with several figures flashing past him, a contemptuous smile playing on his lips.
0:2:7|0:2:24|Seeing the swordsman fighting vigorously, the old man beside him was full of anger. Another wave of assassins rushed forward, attacking while secretly releasing hidden weapons. Despite being surrounded, the swordsman still handled the situation with ease, dodging close-range attacks, blocking the hidden weapons with his sword, and swiftly turning around.
0:2:24|0:2:32|The assassins blocking the way suddenly dodged, as a sword sheath swiftly flashed and plunged into the body of one of the assassins, nailing him to a nearby wooden stake.
0:2:33|0:2:43|One person tried to sneak attack from behind, but the swordsman raised his sword to block it. Surrounded by a large number of opponents attacking from all directions, he remained focused and calm as he swung his sword again.
0:2:43|0:2:49|At this moment, the old man suddenly jumped up, tightly gripped his cane and chopped it down towards the ground, causing the scattered wooden sticks to instantly bounce up.
0:2:51|0:3:6|Swords clashed as the swordsman leaped into the air, a palm strike burst out from his dantian, and a wooden stick shot out in the opposite direction, hitting the old man in the lower body. In his pain, the swordsman took advantage of the situation and intentionally stabbed off target. The old man collapsed to the ground, and the swordsman turned and walked away, his desolate figure gradually fading into the distance.
0:3:8|0:3:16|The scene shifts to the desert, a group of horse bandits wearing straw hats gallop towards the camera, with a mysterious figure standing at the edge of a sand dune.
0:3:16|0:3:22|Soon, the leader of the bandits noticed a suspicious figure, and the entire team immediately came to a halt.
0:3:22|0:3:28|The camera zooms in, and the person standing in front is the [Blind Swordsman] who previously fought with the swordsman.
0:3:28|0:3:31|The leader lowered his mask and looked at the person blocking the way in confusion.
0:3:32|0:3:39|The other side was still unaware of what was happening, but [Ouyang Feng] had already glared angrily, raised his long sword, and slashed towards the group.
0:3:39|0:3:43|The sword energy roared and shook, like a thunderous sound.
0:3:43|0:3:48|In an instant, the sky was filled with swirling sand and dust, causing the entire band of horse bandits to fall into chaos.
0:3:48|0:3:53|[Ouyang Feng]'s internal energy surged, stirring up a layer of sand waves, causing some horses to lose their balance and fall straight down.
0:3:53|0:3:58|The man on the horse fell down, and after a moment, only [Blind Swordsman] rode away gracefully on a horse.
0:4:16|0:4:18|So many years later,
0:4:21|0:4:25|The silhouette of [Blind Swordsman] fades into the distance and disappears completely on the horizon.
0:4:34|0:4:37|After [Ouyang Feng] finished speaking, he revealed a meaningful smile.
0:5:7|0:5:8|After speaking, he stared straight at the other person.
0:5:48|0:5:55|The scene shifts, and [Ouyang Feng] is seen wiping a wine bottle as a figure on horseback appears in the desert.
0:6:1|0:6:4|His name is [Huang Yaoshi].
0:6:13|0:6:19|The night gradually enveloped the sky, [Huang Yaoshi] led his horse to where [Ouyang Feng] lived.
0:6:19|0:6:21|He sat at the table and spoke.
0:6:26|0:6:29|He then got up and sat on the other side, picking up a bottle of wine.
0:6:31|0:6:31|After drinking.
0:6:44|0:6:47|[Huang Yaoshi] carefully observes while leaning on the table.
0:7:2|0:7:9|[Ouyang Feng] behind him did not answer, but looked up at the sky.
0:7:9|0:7:13|[Huang Yaoshi] lovingly caressed the bottle neck.
0:7:13|0:7:17|He smiled at the wine in front of him.
0:7:17|0:7:23|He glanced at [Ouyang Feng] and tore the wind paper with his hand.
0:7:23|0:7:26|[Ouyang Feng] picked up the wine and took a sniff.
0:7:29|0:7:32|He put down the wine cup and pondered for a moment.
0:7:36|0:7:40|Since that night, [Huang Yaoshi] forgot many things.
0:7:40|0:7:44|Seeing [Huang Yaoshi] gradually waking up in the corner, [Ouyang Feng] looked at him and asked.
0:7:48|0:7:54|[Ouyang Feng] crossed his arms and looked at [Huang Yaoshi] sitting on the ground, furrowing his brow as he continued to ask.
0:8:5|0:8:7|The two fell silent as they watched the birdcage.
0:8:7|0:8:15|At night, [Huang Yaoshi] once again drank himself into a stupor, his whole body sprawled on the table, but one of his hands tightly gripped the accessory placed on the table.
0:8:17|0:8:25|In a simple hut, the flickering candlelight cast a faint glow, and apart from the trembling flames, everything else was as silent as death.
0:8:25|0:8:44|At this moment, a delicate hand suddenly appeared beside [Huang Yaoshi]'s face, gently tidying up the scattered hair on his forehead. The gentle fingertips lightly brushed across his cheek, but couldn't help but linger on his firm nose tip, then turned to tidy up the scattered hair around him. This time, the hands did not stop.
0:8:44|0:8:48|Soon, a figure flashed by, decisively leaving.
0:8:48|0:8:57|Lying on the table, [Huang Yaoshi] quickly opened his eyes and looked up, only to see the figure of a woman.
0:9:13|0:9:18|Standing in front of the door, [Ouyang Feng] lightly touched his cheek and watched [Huang Yaoshi] leave.
0:9:18|0:9:22|The scene shifts, with the light shining through the branches casting mottled patterns on both banks.
0:9:22|0:9:24|One month later,
0:9:29|0:9:32|[Huang Yaoshi] smiled as he watched the woman with her back to him.
0:9:45|0:9:53|The girl's hair was disheveled, dressed in coarse clothes. Tears welled up in her eyes when she heard the noise behind her.
0:9:55|0:9:59|After a moment, she tidied the hair piled beside her face and stood up.
0:9:59|0:10:9|She stood with her back to the person behind her, trying hard to control her emotions. Then she took a deep breath, but the mixed emotions still surged up in her heart.
0:10:9|0:10:14|She lifted her head, restraining the tears that wanted to rush out, and forcefully swallowed the grievances in her heart.
0:10:15|0:10:21|The girl quickly regained her composure and turned to look as if nothing had happened.
0:10:21|0:10:30|[Huang Yaoshi] was sitting on a horse, silently watching her. The woman stared at him from a distance for a long time, but soon her eyes became extremely cold.
0:10:30|0:10:39|She turned around, her eyes fixed on [Huang Yaoshi], but without lingering, she immediately turned her head and led the horse forward.
0:10:39|0:10:44|She stubbornly pulled the reins, forcefully dragging the motionless steed, striding in the opposite direction.
0:10:46|0:10:51|In the quiet night, the girl is seen riding on a horse, constantly stroking the horse's neck.
0:10:51|0:10:54|Her eyes were unfocused, revealing a faint smile.
0:10:54|0:11:0|Her legs were placed next to the horse's belly for a moment, then slowly lifted up, repeating this motion continuously.
0:11:0|0:11:2|The girl buried her delicate face in the horse's mane.
0:11:3|0:11:17|Her mouth slightly open, her eyes gazing at the horse with fascination, her slender legs graceful and smooth, the moonlight shining on her body, making her look particularly graceful and charming, as if one is placed in a beautiful painting.
0:11:17|0:11:29|After a while, the woman's tense body suddenly relaxed, one hand weakly hanging down to the side, and her calf slowly lowered. But soon after, she lifted her leg again, pressing tightly against the horse's belly.
0:11:30|0:11:39|At this moment, his body is tense, with his calves slightly bent, muscles slightly bulging, and his hands circling and caressing the strong body of the horse.
0:11:39|0:11:51|After a moment, he raised his hand to tuck the stray hair behind his ear, revealing his face, breathing heavily. Then he buried his head deeply into the horse's neck, crossing his hands in front and embracing the horse's neck.
0:11:55|0:12:2|Huang Yaoshi's pouring action came to a sudden stop, only to see the person opposite him picking up the water pitcher and pouring it into his own bowl.
0:12:2|0:12:14|[Huang Yaoshi], who had lost, moved the wine bottle away and watched quietly as the water in the opponent's bowl kept pouring in. As soon as the person put down the pot, he immediately picked up the bowl filled with water and drank it all in one gulp.
0:12:14|0:12:17|[Huang Yaoshi] looked at the extraordinary warrior in front of him and said.
0:12:19|0:12:21|The warrior looked ahead with indifference and responded.
0:12:24|0:12:38|After speaking, he looked quietly at [Huang Yaoshi] sitting opposite him, with no expression on his face.
0:12:54|0:12:57|The hero lowered his head and chewed on the side dish, making no response.
0:12:57|0:13:5|He furrowed his brow and asked [Huang Yaoshi] in return. Seeing that the other party did not speak, the warrior answered on his own, and after finishing, he picked up the bowl again and drank it all in one gulp.
0:13:5|0:13:6|After that, he wiped the water stains from the corner of his mouth with his sleeve and then left with his sword.
0:13:42|0:13:48|A drinker slammed the table and stood up, only to see the person sitting across from him immediately overturn the table.
0:13:51|0:14:4|Miss [Murong Yan], how dare you offend me like this. Miss [Murong Yan]'s sword was already half drawn, but suddenly pushed back into the scabbard.
0:14:4|0:14:7|[Huang Yaoshi] gently held her hand and persuaded her.
0:14:10|0:14:20|The opponent coldly watched as [Ouyang Feng] stopped his movements. Seeing this, [Ouyang Feng] slowly withdrew his hand, but Miss [Murong Yan] quickly drew her dagger and swung it forcefully.
0:14:20|0:14:27|The wild cat in the shop was startled by the sudden commotion, and [Huang Yaoshi] weakly clung to the pillar, his hands covered in blood.
0:14:27|0:14:33|He squinted at the other person, intending to escape quickly, but his body uncontrollably fell backwards.
0:14:34|0:14:53|At this moment, Miss [Murong Yan] still maintained her sword-wielding posture without moving. [Ouyang Feng], who was injured, had sweat beading on his face as he looked down at the bleeding wound on his abdomen. He extended his fingers, already stained with blood, to examine it repeatedly, revealing a bitter smile. As if resigning herself, she slowly leaned her head against the pillar.
0:15:11|0:15:23|In the scene, Miss [Murong Yan] smiles with satisfaction.
0:15:58|0:16:9|The other party shook his head uncontrollably after hearing it, but in an instant his expression turned sinister.
0:16:9|0:16:13|After the two of them talked, [Ouyang Feng] learned the ins and outs of the matter.
0:16:35|0:16:50|The scene goes back to the night when [Huang Yaoshi] and [Murong Yan] were drinking and chatting. Both were intoxicated, and [Murong Yan], feeling shy, looked at [Huang Yaoshi] intentionally or unintentionally. She pretended to be calm as she raised her hand to drink another bowl, looking at him with a proud expression.
0:16:50|0:16:54|Huang Yaoshi also lifted the wine cup upon seeing this, staring at the other's face and drinking it all in one gulp.
0:16:56|0:17:5|With the help of alcohol, [Ouyang Feng] saw [Murong Yan]'s face become even more beautiful, making him unable to help but stare at her a few more times.
0:17:5|0:17:10|Finally, [Huang Yaoshi] couldn't help but reach out and touch her cheek, his eyes gentle as water.
0:17:16|0:17:27|After speaking, [Huang Yaoshi] withdrew his hand. [Murong Yan] turned her face away without looking at him. Unintentionally, [Murong Yan] knocked a chopstick off the table. She bent down to pick it up, her expression becoming awkward.
0:17:43|0:17:45|Later, the two of them set a date.
0:17:49|0:17:57|On the day of the appointment, the woman who looks exactly like [Murong Yan] waited for a long time, but [Huang Yaoshi]'s figure had not yet appeared.
0:17:57|0:18:6|He anxiously looked around, but there was only the sound of the wind next to Gor. His inner hope quickly turned into disappointment, followed by a surge of anger.
0:18:8|0:18:14|The dejected woman stumbled towards the tree.
0:18:14|0:18:21|She leaned her whole body against the tree trunk, frowning and shedding tears silently, her stubborn self-esteem shattered at this moment.
0:18:31|0:18:36|The woman shouted out the pain suppressed in her heart, but inside, it hurt like a knife stabbing.
0:18:36|0:18:42|She tightly closed her eyes, clenched her teeth, and her delicate face was momentarily clouded with sorrow.
0:18:42|0:18:49|Before the eyes, the endless desert stretches with countless folds of sand and stones, extending all the way to the distant horizon.
0:20:1|0:20:6|The woman left after bursts of laughter, leaving [Ouyang Feng] looking at her back in confusion.
0:20:6|0:20:9|The next day, [Murong Yan] made an appointment to meet [Ouyang Feng].
0:20:28|0:20:32|Immediately, he turned his head and looked towards [Murong Yan] beside him.
0:20:33|0:20:37|The other party pondered for a moment after hearing this, and their eyes instantly became sharp.
0:20:51|0:20:57|At dusk, a figure quietly appeared in the home of [Ouyang Feng], and the visitor was none other than the sister of [Murong Yan].
0:20:57|0:21:5|She walked slowly through the dim corridor, holding a birdcage in her hand. Just as she was about to enter, a hint of vigilance flashed in her eyes.
0:21:5|0:21:12|Soon, the woman no longer hesitated and walked in, her back facing [Ouyang Feng].
0:21:12|0:21:15|The woven birdcage spins in front of the woman, its reflection shining on her face.
0:21:19|0:21:23|[Ouyang Feng] looked at the woman's back and stirred the food in his mouth.
0:21:25|0:21:27|He approached while speaking.
0:21:36|0:21:41|After speaking, he walked to the table on the side and picked up a cup, pouring some water onto his hand.
0:22:54|0:23:1|The woman remained silent, walking to the side of the birdcage and slowly sitting down, [Ouyang Feng] turned to look at her.
0:23:1|0:23:9|Night falls, the woman leaves with a birdcage.
0:23:9|0:23:12|Before long, a birdcage appeared at the door of [Ouyang Feng].
0:23:12|0:23:18|He walked out the door and carefully observed, then turned to look behind him. The woman upstairs immediately hid back into the room.
0:23:20|0:23:29|The woman turned her back tightly against the wall, her body trembling uncontrollably. She occasionally looked back towards the door, then quickly turned her head away.
0:23:29|0:23:34|She clung tightly to the wall with both hands, her body desperately shrinking inward.
0:23:34|0:23:38|At this moment, [Ouyang Feng] slowly approached, standing behind her.
0:23:45|0:23:49|The woman, in an emotional outburst, then turned and threw herself into [Ouyang Feng]'s arms.
0:23:57|0:24:6|A few days after giving her some wine, [Murong Yan] came to see [Ouyang Feng] and started questioning him as soon as she sat down.
0:24:44|0:24:47|Murong Yan's eyes shimmered with a cold light that traversed back and forth.
0:24:47|0:24:49|Ouyang Feng walked up to the birdcage.
0:24:51|0:24:51|Ouyang Feng asked in return.
0:24:51|0:24:52|He didn't rush to answer, but walked quietly to the other side of the birdcage, lowered his head in thought before speaking.
0:25:12|0:25:15|After saying that, he lowered his head as if nothing had happened.
0:25:28|0:25:31|There is a wounded person hiding.
0:25:35|0:25:39|Murong Yan threw the wine bowl and looked up at the night sky.
0:25:41|0:25:42|After speaking, she turned her head to one side.
0:25:42|0:25:46|Wearing men's clothing, [Murong Yan] was half drunk and half awake, after pondering for a while, she turned to look at the person she was talking to, only seeing a blurry silhouette in the night.
0:26:18|0:26:21|[Murong Yan] speaks while touching her own neck.
0:26:44|0:26:47|She buried her head in her arms, waiting for the other person to answer.
0:26:47|0:26:55|After saying those words while drunk, [Murong Yan] lifted her head and the moonlight shone on her face.
0:27:15|0:27:21|She lowered her head in pain, tears swirling in her eyes.
0:27:23|0:27:31|[Murong Yan]'s narrow phoenix eyes were suddenly filled with jealousy, as if a fiery killing intent was emanating from her.
0:27:42|0:27:53|After speaking, a hint of a pleased smile appeared on her face, then she gently raised her hand to touch her own face.
0:27:53|0:28:0|She looked at the moonlight outside the window, gently closed her eyes, and slowly spoke.
0:28:0|0:28:3|At this moment, [Murong Yan] suddenly turned around.
0:28:13|0:28:20|After speaking, she couldn't help but get angry, turned around and leaned against the window, tightly covering her mouth.
0:28:20|0:28:23|[Ouyang Feng] stood in the shadows, quietly watching her.
0:28:23|0:28:26|That night seemed particularly long.
0:28:36|0:28:40|Time passed in the blink of an eye, and the dark sky gradually returned to brightness.
0:28:40|0:28:47|[Murong Yan] leaned against the wall, looking ahead listlessly, as [Ouyang Feng] approached.
0:28:47|0:28:52|Murong Yan listened but showed no reaction.
0:28:52|0:29:0|At this moment, she finally reacted.
0:29:0|0:29:5|[Ouyang Feng] looked at the weary figure in front of him and answered after a moment of contemplation.
0:29:17|0:29:24|The night gradually envelops the earth, a suspicious figure suddenly appears, quietly moving along the wall.
0:29:24|0:29:29|The moonlight outside the window shines into the room, casting his figure in and out of shadows.
0:29:29|0:29:33|[Ouyang Feng], who had already rested, lay on the bed sleeping soundly.
0:29:38|0:29:41|The delicate profile paused in the moonlight, the person who came was [Murong Yan].
0:29:41|0:29:46|Ouyang Feng, in a deep sleep, slightly closed his eyes and breathed lightly.
0:29:46|0:29:55|At this moment, a slender hand slowly approached her cheek. It was [Murong Yan] sitting behind her, gazing affectionately at the reclining [Ouyang Feng].
0:29:56|0:30:3|At this moment, whether he is Ouyang Feng or Murong Yan, he has already deeply fallen into this unattainable love.
0:30:3|0:30:9|He greedily caressed Ouyang Feng's cheek, then slid gently down his neck to his arm.
0:30:9|0:30:16|His hand quickly slid more wantonly towards [Ouyang Feng]'s thigh, but his eyes were fixed on his profile.
0:30:17|0:30:21|[Ouyang Feng] kept his eyes tightly shut, as if completely unaware.
0:30:21|0:30:31|Murong Yan's fingers were as soft as willow branches, wandering around Ouyang Feng's thighs, with the shadows of the moving fingers reflected on the wall.
0:30:31|0:30:41|The scene shifts, [Ouyang Feng] has opened his eyes, and at this moment, the hand slowly pushes aside his clothes, slipping into his chest, but he closes his eyes again.
0:30:42|0:30:50|At this moment, the person behind him also underwent a change in heart along with him, and that person was not [Murong Yan], but another beautiful woman.
0:30:50|0:31:0|The enchanting hand of [Ouyang Feng] slid around his waist, its movements becoming more unrestrained, yet the eyes gazed at her with infatuation.
0:31:0|0:31:1|Murong Yan's hand slowly moved up across her chest.
0:31:17|0:31:22|In her eyes, the person lying in front of her is not [Ouyang Feng], but [Huang Yaoshi].
0:31:22|0:31:28|She gently touched the sharp contours of her memory's face, arranging the scattered hair on both sides.
0:31:28|0:31:33|Day after day, [Murong Yan] would come to [Ouyang Feng]'s residence every night.
0:31:33|0:31:37|She either tied up her hair or let it fall loosely down her back.
0:31:37|0:31:43|Unfortunately, she lay as usual beside [Ouyang Feng], constantly caressing his solid chest.
0:31:45|0:31:50|When the love went deep, he couldn't help but fall into this beautiful fantasy.
0:31:50|0:31:58|He, dressed in a long robe, with hair flowing like a waterfall, leaned against the wall, his cheeks showing a hint of charm.
0:31:58|0:32:8|Shortly after, he walked to a withered tree outside the door, leaning his whole body against the trunk. He gently swayed, responding to the uncontrollable desires in his heart.
0:32:8|0:32:12|His hands tightly gripped the branches on both sides, occasionally making a sound.
0:32:29|0:32:32|The wind rustled through the leaves.
0:32:32|0:32:34|That day began.
0:32:37|0:32:43|Years later, a strange swordsman appeared in the martial world, and no one knew his origins.
0:32:46|0:32:49|He has a very special name, called [Ouyang Feng].
0:32:50|0:32:55|From then on, [Murong Yan] adopted the alias Lone Swordsmen and became a renowned swordsman in the martial arts world.
0:32:55|0:33:2|She spends her days practicing swordsmanship by the lake, either dressed in a white dress or in a long robe with her hair tied up in a crown.
0:33:2|0:33:7|The steel sword danced in his hands, stirring up majestic sword energy and creating waves of splashes.
0:33:7|0:33:14|Dozens of meters high waves cascaded down like a waterfall, with [Murong Yan] holding a sword in her left hand pointing straight ahead.
0:33:14|0:33:18|Her eyes were cold, like a glacier, making people hesitate.
0:33:19|0:33:27|The figure moved as light as [Tao Hua], graceful and elegant, displaying a sense of elegance in the flowing movements. Amidst the heroic and spirited demeanor, a set of sword techniques had been perfected.
0:33:27|0:33:36|He stood in place, still holding his sword, and couldn't help but shout out loud.
0:33:36|0:33:45|The misty lake water gently swayed, like a piece of dancing silk in the wind. The sky was reflected in the lake, making it hard to distinguish between heaven and earth.
0:33:47|0:33:56|The undulating mountains, embedded in the sky, [Murong Yan] walks on the opposite side of the lake, only able to see his silhouette, but not his face.
0:33:56|0:34:2|The dawn slowly unfolds, a woman stands with her back to the door of [Ouyang Feng].
0:34:3|0:34:5|The woman had a melancholy expression as she raised her head slightly.
0:34:10|0:34:13|The woman furrowed her brow and said slowly.
0:34:25|0:34:28|Ouyang Feng walked towards the woman after hearing.
0:34:29|0:34:32|After speaking, he crossed his arms and looked at the woman.
0:34:38|0:34:40|[Ouyang Feng] nodded slightly and then asked.
0:34:42|0:34:45|The woman lowered her head even further, holding a basket of eggs in her hands.
0:34:45|0:34:47|[Ouyang Feng] stood still, silently watching the woman.
0:34:47|0:34:48|He looked up and down, shook his head, and let out a long sigh.
0:34:48|0:34:48|He furrowed his brow and tried to persuade the woman.
0:34:48|0:34:48|[Ouyang Feng] looks serious.
0:35:17|0:35:19|The woman adjusted her long hair, covering her cheeks.
0:35:19|0:35:20|After speaking, Ouyang Feng stared at her intently.
0:35:20|0:35:21|The woman tilted her head slightly after hearing it.
0:35:50|0:35:58|At dusk, a woman's figure appeared on the hilltop. She gazed at [Ouyang Feng]'s residence for a long time, then turned and led the donkey away.
0:36:12|0:36:16|The next morning, [Ouyang Feng] stood high and looked at the woman.
0:36:19|0:36:30|The scene shifts, and [Ouyang Feng]'s elder sister-in-law is combing her hair in front of the mirror. Her complexion is crystal clear, with a radiant glow like snow. Delicate and gentle, her eyebrows are like a painting, exuding an indescribable charm and delicacy.
0:36:30|0:36:38|She raised her slender jade hand, lifted the embroidered hair on the side, but the smile on her face gradually disappeared, replaced by a hint of melancholy in her eyes.
0:36:38|0:36:44|The room was empty except for her. She sat on the blanket, looking at herself in the mirror.
0:36:44|0:36:48|Unexpected melancholy came over her, the prelude of which she did not know when it began, as she arrived at her new house.
0:37:2|0:37:17|In the dream, [Ouyang Feng] seemed to be back at the White Ostrich Mountain, the familiar lake was clear and transparent, as calm as a mirror, about to merge with the sky. But in an instant, the person accompanying him rode away, leaving [Ouyang Feng] alone by the lake.
0:37:18|0:37:27|At that moment, he woke up, opened his eyes and looked outside the door. An endless desert came into view, with rolling hills in the distance.
0:37:27|0:37:43|At this moment, a pair of bright and piercing eyes appeared on the screen. Under the sunlight, he slowly closed his eyes. At that moment, the sun quietly hid behind the clouds, and the earth momentarily darkened. [Ouyang Feng] walked out from the house, cautiously observing the stranger in front of him.
0:37:45|0:37:48|The man slowly opened his eyes, [Ouyang Feng] glanced at the corpses, and asked.
0:37:48|0:37:51|The man opened his chapped lips and then turned around to ask.
0:38:18|0:38:21|[Ouyang Feng] wipes his hands with a book of poetry and history.
0:38:21|0:38:23|A few months ago.
0:38:38|0:38:43|Not far away, a woman crouched by the road waiting, while a man stood with his back to [Ouyang Feng].
0:38:46|0:38:48|The duel between the man and the Blind Swordsman quickly begins, with him standing in place, head lowered.
0:39:6|0:39:9|The quick swordsman gripped the knife in his hand without any hesitation.
0:39:9|0:39:15|On the side of the mountain peak, a figure sat quietly at the top, observing the situation of the two.
0:39:15|0:39:17|The man is [Ouyang Feng].
0:39:17|0:39:25|The man lifted his head, his gaze as if lifting, staring fixedly at the setting sun, but the intense beam of light made him unable to help closing his eyes.
0:39:25|0:39:31|The quick-handed [Blind Swordsman] charged towards the man. At a critical moment, the man moved swiftly, dodging the long knife and striking back with all his might.
0:39:42|0:39:46|As soon as the words fell, the quick swordsman fell straight down.
0:39:46|0:39:56|In the evening, a gentle breeze blew in, causing the window curtains to flutter. A man led a horse back to [Ouyang Feng]'s residence.
0:39:56|0:40:1|The man seemed as if he hadn't heard anything, brushed past the woman, and then walked on by himself.
0:40:11|0:40:19|As the sun set, the man chewed on his food, but his eyes were fixed on the outside.
0:40:19|0:40:25|The woman sat on the ground leaning against a wooden stake, with a donkey standing behind her and a basket of eggs beside her.
0:40:25|0:40:33|After a while, the woman stood up again and took a few steps. She looked up at the sun overhead, opened the handkerchief in her hand, and covered her face.
0:40:33|0:40:37|The man was standing outside the door, gazing at the woman.
0:40:37|0:40:39|[Ouyang Feng] was puzzled, the man's lips were pale, he took a deep breath.
0:40:48|0:40:56|Seeing the man not responding, [Ouyang Feng] walked up to him and placed both hands on the wooden fence.
0:40:56|0:41:3|At this moment, the woman that [Huang Yaoshi] once searched for appears on the screen.
0:41:3|0:41:10|After the man finished speaking, [Ouyang Feng] did not respond anymore, and the two remained silent for a long time.
0:41:10|0:41:12|[Ouyang Feng] ponders for a moment before answering before leaving.
0:41:14|0:41:16|Finally, the man looked into the distance.
0:41:23|0:41:27|Day and night alternate, and the days pass by one after another.
0:41:27|0:41:36|The man sat on the steps in front of the door all day, sometimes looking up at the setting sun, but soon lowering his head to stare blankly into the distance.
0:41:36|0:41:41|After a few more days, the bandits still did not arrive. The man went to a distant hilltop and waited in silence.
0:41:53|0:41:59|His desolate figure sat at the peak of the mountain, inserting the long sword he carried with him into the soil.
0:42:5|0:42:9|In the room, the man slowly extends the torch in his hand towards the wick.
0:42:9|0:42:17|After a while, the wick was lit, his face illuminated by the candlelight, but his eyes remained tightly shut.
0:42:17|0:42:23|Outside the door, the woman still sat on the ground, with a donkey poking its head around her from side to side, the desert night wind was inevitably a bit cold.
0:42:24|0:42:29|The woman tightly hugged herself with both hands, burying her head deeply in the crook of her arm.
0:42:29|0:42:34|Her face showed no emotion, but was filled with exhaustion.
0:42:38|0:42:44|Upon hearing the question from the other party, the man lowered his head and fell silent.
0:42:44|0:42:48|Upon hearing the words "hometown," the man seemed to recall something.
0:42:48|0:42:53|His hands trembled slightly, he grabbed his collar and wiped the sweat off his mouth, leaning back against the wall.
0:43:11|0:43:15|The woman holding the egg asked the question and stared at him intently, waiting for his answer.
0:43:15|0:43:19|After a while, the woman turned around and left the room, walking quietly towards the outside.
0:43:19|0:43:23|Her steps were unsteady, with tears faintly visible on her face.
0:43:23|0:43:27|Perhaps, she herself didn't expect that the man would reject her.
0:43:27|0:43:30|The woman's self-esteem shatters at this moment.
0:43:30|0:43:32|She frowned, gripping the pillar tightly.
0:43:32|0:43:36|[Ouyang Feng] is drinking in the courtyard, a bowl is placed in front of him.
0:43:38|0:43:45|She took a bite of the food in her mouth, looked up, then picked up the wine vessel on the table and poured it into the bowl.
0:43:45|0:43:50|The man watched quietly as the wine poured slowly, then picked up the wine bowl and drank it all in one gulp.
0:43:52|0:43:57|The man casually placed the wine cup on the table, rolled up his sleeves, and wiped his mouth.
0:43:59|0:44:6|Her face showed a sense of determination, [Ouyang Feng] looked straight at her, then quickly shifted his gaze elsewhere.
0:44:8|0:44:9|The man stopped in his tracks and replied.
0:44:43|0:44:48|[Ouyang Feng] stared at him with wide eyes, but the man left without looking back.
0:44:48|0:44:51|An hour later, the man led the horse and prepared to set off.
0:44:51|0:44:57|When passing the intersection, he paused in front of the woman holding the eggs for a moment, but quickly turned and left.
0:44:57|0:45:1|He took a few steps and then stopped again, bowing his head in contemplation.
0:45:2|0:45:6|The woman behind is standing still with a basket of eggs.
0:45:6|0:45:12|At this moment, the man suddenly turned around, inserted the sword into the sand, and tightly embraced the woman, steadying himself.
0:45:12|0:45:16|The woman's face was full of resistance, using all her strength to push the other person away.
0:45:16|0:45:20|The man immediately turned around at this moment, sheathed his long sword, and left.
0:45:20|0:45:27|The woman, feeling angry, squatted down, grabbed a handful of sand and threw it at his back, then walked back and leaned against a wooden stake.
0:45:27|0:45:29|At this moment, the man furrowed his brow.
0:45:38|0:45:47|The woman who was forcibly kissed broke down emotionally, squatting on the ground holding her head and crying in pain, with most of the eggs in the basket beside her already smashed.
0:45:47|0:45:50|She cried as she picked up the broken eggs one by one and put them back into the basket.
0:45:55|0:46:2|The man was thinking about the woman in his hometown, but little did he know that at this moment, the woman in his hometown was tightly holding onto his clothes.
0:46:2|0:46:17|He walked forward expressionlessly, his eyes filled with determination. Beads of sweat glistened on his face, and his eyes appeared even deeper in the dimly lit corridor. The battle against the bandits was not only a fierce fight, but also a daring gamble with fate.
0:46:17|0:46:21|No one knows if he will ever see the hometown's [Tao Hua] again after he leaves.
0:46:23|0:46:25|A pair of horse thieves are galloping towards us, exchanging whips.
0:46:54|0:47:1|Not far away, a man is sitting in an abandoned wooden house, waiting. He closes his eyes and concentrates, waiting for a storm to come.
0:47:1|0:47:11|The woman holding the eggs is still standing at the intersection next to [Ouyang Feng]'s residence, but this time, she doesn't have any eggs in her hands, only the remaining donkey still standing beside her.
0:47:11|0:47:17|She squatted helplessly on the ground, grabbed a handful of sand and threw it out as if still in a fit of anger.
0:47:18|0:47:24|On the other side, the man picked up a jar of wine on the table and drank it all, wiping his mouth with his sleeve.
0:47:24|0:47:30|The bandit group with straw hats watched him quietly, their eyes extremely fierce.
0:47:30|0:47:34|In this moment, the bandits rushed forward with their swords in a chaotic manner.
0:47:38|0:47:42|At that moment, flames burst out and ignited the clothes of the person at the forefront.
0:47:44|0:47:47|He drew his sword in the chaos and fought fiercely against the bandits on horseback.
0:47:47|0:47:52|After a few moves, the bandits suffered numerous casualties, while the man remained unscathed.
0:47:52|0:47:58|The others, seeing the situation, did not dare to rush forward to their deaths, only holding their knives and glaring at the man with fierce eyes.
0:47:58|0:48:2|The seemingly harmonious scene did not last long, and the two sides started fighting again.
0:48:2|0:48:4|At this moment, another group of people and horses arrived outside.
0:48:6|0:48:15|More and more opponents appeared, the man swung his sword left and right to remove the obstacles in front of him, and then leaped through the thatched roof to stand on the earthen wall.
0:48:15|0:48:26|At this moment, the woman was still standing at the intersection, leaning on a wooden stake on the side. She was wiping the sweat off her neck with a handkerchief, then fully unfolding it, neatly folding it up. The donkey behind her occasionally flicked its ears.
0:48:30|0:48:49|The sky, originally bathed in the bright moonlight, was suddenly covered by dark clouds. The man looked up, then turned his gaze to the densely packed bandits surrounding him. Each of them held a knife with a fierce look on their faces. The man furrowed his brow, raised his long sword high, and slowly approached the people in front of him. However, the people behind him also began to slowly close in step by step.
0:48:49|0:48:54|The man's sharp eyes were filled with killing intent as he observed the movements of the people around him.
0:48:58|0:49:5|A furious shout broke through the battlefield, the man's sword swinging faster, with the sound of wailing constantly echoing in his ears.
0:49:5|0:49:17|A large group of bandits, like vicious dogs, attacked the lone man one after another. He wielded his sword to defend against the attacks, seizing the opportunity to strike accurately when the opponents were off guard.
0:49:17|0:49:22|The injured bandit on the ground stirred up the dust and let out a painful roar.
0:49:22|0:49:33|At this moment, the man was still wielding his sword methodically, the sky gradually darkening. Some fearless desperados in the bandit group once again approached.
0:49:33|0:49:42|The brave and skilled man is determined to confront him, but at this moment, another wave of enemies is attacking. They are riding horses quickly towards the man's location.
0:49:45|0:49:51|But as the man dealt with the opponents in front of him, the group of people and horses had already reached the hillside 100 meters away from him.
0:49:51|0:50:1|At this moment, another group of people with big knives in hand were running down the hill behind him, shouting.
0:50:12|0:50:16|He quickly ran forward, ready to face the enemy head-on.
0:50:16|0:50:21|The horse thief who rushed to the front was almost not yet clean, and was killed by a man with a single knife.
0:50:21|0:50:25|Others rushed forward, swords flashing and clashing.
0:50:25|0:50:28|The harsh sound of metal clashing echoed continuously.
0:50:28|0:50:34|Most of the horse thieves were no match for the men, only leaving behind a painful scream before meeting their demise.
0:50:34|0:50:39|As the men were killing with great gusto, a figure on horseback was slowly approaching.
0:50:40|0:50:48|The man sensed danger and turned around, when suddenly a figure descended from the sky and struck heavily down on the man's neck.
0:50:48|0:50:53|In the woods of his hometown at this moment, the birds were fleeing like evil spirits.
0:51:5|0:51:12|The man who suffered a fatal blow silently lowered his head, and this difficult duel ultimately ended in failure.
0:51:12|0:51:19|At the moment when the blade cut across the neck, he seemed to see the woman from his longed-for hometown again.
0:51:19|0:51:25|And on that day, [Huang Yaoshi] was still waiting at [Ouyang Feng]'s residence for the man to return.
0:51:25|0:51:28|He sat on the stool and took a sip from the wine bowl on the table.
0:51:49|0:51:57|Two days later, a duel took place at the lake, with the person on horseback being caught off guard by the surprise attack from the Barefooted Hero lurking in the water.
0:51:57|0:52:2|A companion on the side saw the Barefooted Hero reveal his true identity and immediately rushed up to chop down with a knife.
0:52:3|0:52:7|The barefoot hero did a backflip and kicked the man away with one foot.
0:52:7|0:52:11|The final member of the team rode a fast horse and galloped over.
0:52:11|0:52:18|His moves were fierce and swift, while the Barefoot Hero countered each move and found the opportunity to stab towards his abdomen.
0:52:18|0:52:22|The opponent let out a painful cry, staring at him with wide eyes.
0:53:48|0:53:52|Sitting in the corner, [Tao Hua] chewed on the food in her mouth and looked at [Ouyang Feng].
0:53:52|0:53:57|The scene shifts, a group of people and horses are marching in an orderly manner towards the depths of the desert.
0:53:57|0:54:4|They rode on horseback one by one, wearing helmets and making constant metallic clashing sounds, appearing particularly imposing.
0:54:4|0:54:6|Murong Yan has not been here for long.
0:54:18|0:54:22|Sitting among a group of swordsmen, [Hong Qi] constantly tidied his shoes.
0:54:22|0:54:26|[Ouyang Feng] sits in front of the villagers with an umbrella.
0:54:29|0:54:33|Wiping the sweat flowing down his chest with a handkerchief.
0:54:41|0:54:44|After speaking, he looked arrogantly at the villagers.
0:54:49|0:54:54|Seeing no one responding on the other side, [Ouyang Feng] sighed helplessly.
0:54:54|0:55:5|He then raised his hand to wipe the sweat off both sides of his cheeks.
0:55:5|0:55:9|[Ouyang Feng] watched the reactions of the people around him without moving.
0:55:23|0:55:26|He cunningly looked at the villagers standing up.
0:55:34|0:55:37|A few days ago, he ambushed horse thieves here.
0:55:40|0:55:42|Who knows that he died himself.
0:56:1|0:56:5|[Ouyang Feng] took off his dust mask and spoke earnestly.
0:56:7|0:56:13|Pay attention to one person, and once he finishes speaking, he turns and leaves.
0:56:35|0:56:41|The midday desert exuded a hint of heat, with a faint and lingering heat wave in the air.
0:56:41|0:56:49|At this moment, the bandits' figures appeared on the sand dunes, holding red flags and camels that had been waiting for a long time, quietly observing the movements of the group.
0:56:49|0:56:53|As the bandits were about to approach, a sudden gust of wind swept through the desert.
0:56:53|0:56:57|The sand and dust filled the air, making everything around unclear.
0:56:57|0:57:1|The horse thief riding on the horse was also forced to retreat repeatedly by the sudden sandstorm.
0:57:2|0:57:8|They had to dismount and lead the horses by the reins, struggling to move forward.
0:57:8|0:57:16|The horse was blown to the side by the wind, and the horse thief quickly caught up, pulled it back, and continued to walk towards the direction where the wind was strongest.
0:57:16|0:57:21|Seeing the bandits in chaos, [Hong Qi] seized the opportunity to draw his sword and quickly rushed towards the group.
0:57:21|0:57:26|Unexpectedly, the bandit's reaction was also extremely quick, immediately raising his sword to block the attack.
0:57:26|0:57:34|Hong Qi's power was immense, and he quickly took care of him in just a few moves, also killing a few companions who tried to help.
0:57:34|0:57:40|At this moment, other bandits rushed over one after another, [Hong Qi] swiftly wielded his knife, killing each one he encountered.
0:57:40|0:57:47|He keeps his eyes on all directions and ears open to all sounds, able to handle any situation whether it's a direct confrontation or a surprise attack from behind with ease.
0:57:48|0:58:6|At this moment, a masked man drew his sword with his left hand ready to attack. [Hong Qi] quickly stepped in front of him, picked up a long sword and swung it upwards. Accompanied by a painful scream, a bloody arm flew into the sky. The other bandits were furious, mounted their horses, brandished their swords, and charged towards [Hong Qi], plunging the scene into chaos once again.
0:58:7|0:58:11|Even the frightened horses were planning to escape in groups.
0:58:11|0:58:22|Killing the horse thief who wielded the knife in his left hand, [Hong Qi] gained a great advantage. In just a few hours, he had eliminated all the remaining horse thieves, and the horses on the sand dunes were set free, still running forward with all their might.
0:58:23|0:58:30|From a distance, Ouyang Feng, who was watching everything, couldn't help but smile, then quickly put on his mask and silently left.
0:58:30|0:58:41|Looking around, the desert is littered with the bodies of bandits, their clothes covered in sand and half buried by the wind. Yet the bloodstains on their bodies remain particularly prominent.
0:58:41|0:58:46|Under the dark sky, a thick fog gathered and drifted towards the distance.
0:58:59|0:59:5|[Murong Yan] lies on the hammock, carefully counting the money in her hand, then tucks it into her waist, remembering it firmly.
0:59:15|0:59:18|[Hong Qi], he's gone.
0:59:28|0:59:31|He turned silently and looked at the distant desert.
0:59:31|0:59:35|[Ouyang Feng] paused for a moment, strolled over, and stood in front of him.
0:59:35|0:59:40|He looked up and down at the woman in front of him, her face full of stubbornness, leaning forward.
0:59:42|0:59:51|The woman stubbornly turned her head to look into the distance. From that day on, she would come to the vicinity every day, waiting and keeping an eye on the movements of the camel at the door.
1:0:3|1:0:8|The woman looked at the camel with a sense of grievance, the corners of her mouth involuntarily turning downwards.
1:0:8|1:0:12|Once a beautiful face, now dirtied by the wind and sand.
1:0:12|1:0:16|The next day, [Ouyang Feng] stood at the door observing the commotion below.
1:0:24|1:0:26|The woman lowered her head and did not look at him.
1:0:28|1:0:33|Seeing that he still didn't move, [Murong Yan] stepped forward and gave him a push, the woman turned her head and shouted in dissatisfaction.
1:0:40|1:0:46|The woman, forced by circumstances, had no choice but to turn around and take step by step forward.
1:0:46|1:0:52|[Hong Qi] stood still, watching the woman's back. Seeing that she didn't turn around, he didn't urge her again.
1:0:52|1:0:58|The camel on the side turned its head, looking at the two people, then nonchalantly started chewing on the licorice in its mouth.
1:0:58|1:1:2|A few days later, [Ouyang Feng] found the woman who had been driven away by [Hong Qi] again.
1:1:13|1:1:24|Who says it can't be done? After [Ouyang Feng] said that, he gave a bitter smile, crossed his arms in front of his chest, as if recalling something.
1:1:31|1:1:34|His brows furrowed and his eyes suddenly turned cold.
1:1:45|1:1:51|That night, the woman with the eggs came to ask for help again, and [Ouyang Feng] squatted at the door, staring at her.
1:2:1|1:2:4|The woman holding the basket tightened her grip involuntarily.
1:2:15|1:2:17|After saying that, he stood up and went back into the house.
1:2:17|1:2:24|After a while, [Ouyang Feng] stood at the door with an umbrella, looking from a distance at the woman he had rejected.
1:2:24|1:2:32|The vast desert stretches as far as the eye can see, with misty smoke and waves. The figure of the [Girl] appears particularly small, in the treacherous world of the martial arts, where human hearts are hard to fathom.
1:2:32|1:2:36|[Ouyang Feng], as a middleman, prefers not to get involved in disputes, and no one can blame him.
1:2:37|1:2:42|[Girl] leaned against a wooden stake at the end of the road, exuding a sense of powerlessness all over her body.
1:2:42|1:2:48|Her face was pale, but her eyes were firmly fixed on the other end, where [Hong Qi] was staring at her.
1:2:59|1:3:10|The rain-dodging swordsman wiped the rain off his face. At this moment, [Hong Qi] strode in with a knife in hand. The surrounding swordsmen looked at him, their eyes filled with doubt and caution.
1:3:10|1:3:15|The leading swordsman took a step forward and everyone rushed forward to compete with [Hong Qi].
1:3:16|1:3:25|Countless swords flashed before him, but he didn't pay attention and was kicked by one of them, causing his hat to be split in half.
1:3:25|1:3:34|Shortly after, [Hong Qi] immediately leaped from the table and flew towards the person on the empty ground, delivering a powerful strike. A deep wound appeared on the person's waist.
1:3:34|1:3:37|Seeing that [Hong Qi] was difficult to deal with, the leading fat swordsman took advantage of the chaos to launch a sneak attack.
1:3:38|1:3:43|[Hong Qi] was unable to dodge in time, and half of his finger was forcibly cut off.
1:3:43|1:3:47|She glared at the swordsman with a sword in her hand, enduring the intense pain from her injuries.
1:3:47|1:3:53|Injured [Tao Hua] was filled with anger in her heart, and her movements became faster.
1:3:53|1:3:55|She quickly turned around, blocking attacks from all directions.
1:3:56|1:4:4|One of the swordsmen couldn't resist the relentless attacks from [Hong Qi], and was kicked down the stairs, falling onto the stove.
1:4:4|1:4:12|Shortly after, [Hong Qi] leaped down from upstairs. The fat swordsman took the initiative to confront him, but before he could react, the intense pain in his ear made him cry out involuntarily.
1:4:13|1:4:16|Anger surged in the swordsman's heart for a moment.
1:4:16|1:4:22|Unexpectedly, [Tao Hua]'s movements were even faster, and in a flash, the other ear was swiftly cut off.
1:4:22|1:4:26|After enduring repeated attacks, the swordsman was covered in wounds.
1:4:26|1:4:32|[Tao Hua] suddenly pulled the knife out from the opponent's abdomen, causing him to spurt out a mouthful of blood and then fall straight down.
1:4:44|1:4:50|Hong Qi, who had already been bandaged, lay on the bed, turning his head to look at Ouyang Feng playing with eggs.
1:4:59|1:5:4|Hong Qi opened his eyes and looked at the ceiling, then turned to Ouyang Feng beside him.
1:5:41|1:5:43|[Ouyang Feng] put down the hand holding the egg, showing a smile, then tossed the egg up and played with it casually.
1:6:27|1:6:35|Upon hearing [Hong Qi]'s contemptuous laughter, [Ouyang Feng]'s face instantly turned sinister, the anger in his eyes barely concealed.
1:6:35|1:6:39|When he turned back to [Hong Qi], his emotions seemed to have suddenly disappeared.
1:6:42|1:6:48|[Ouyang Feng]'s eating motion froze at that moment, the woman shed a tear and bowed her head deeply.
1:7:7|1:7:14|After speaking, he took a sip of water from the wooden ladle, then threw the ladle into the water tank, creating small ripples.
1:7:14|1:7:18|Ouyang Feng wiped his mouth and then stood behind the woman.
1:7:37|1:7:39|He smugly leaned close to the woman's embroidered hair.
1:7:52|1:8:1|With a sly gleam in his eyes, he then turned around coldly and left with his hands behind his back.
1:8:1|1:8:4|In the room, the dying Ouyang Feng slowly grasped the hand of Murong Yan.
1:8:4|1:8:6|[Hong Qi] tried to comfort the heartbroken woman with a heavy heart.
1:8:31|1:8:37|Hong Qi, weakly, lifted his head and looked at the woman in front of him who dared not raise her head because of guilt.
1:8:51|1:8:58|The woman cried bitterly in front of [Hong Qi], while [Hong Qi] lying beside her tried hard to move her body, staying close to her head.
1:8:58|1:9:9|As the day just began to break, [Hong Qi]'s wife sat on the hilltop, humming a tune, a smile playing on her face, her hands busy with needlework without pause.
1:9:9|1:9:18|She carefully examined the straw shoes in her hand, starting from each stitch, carefully checking every detail. Her white teeth were bright on her dark face.
1:9:19|1:9:25|A few days later, [Hong Qi] returned home and lay on a hammock, casually placing his hand above his head.
1:9:25|1:9:32|His wife sat in the opposite hanging chair, scooped out a spoonful of rice from the bowl, sang a song, and handed it to him.
1:9:32|1:9:35|[Hong Qi] raised his head and finished the rice in one go.
1:9:35|1:9:41|Turning his head, closing his eyes, chewing slowly, the swing beneath him swayed even more vigorously.
1:9:41|1:9:44|On the other side, the woman holding the eggs left with a donkey.
1:9:46|1:9:50|The figure of the woman and the donkey gradually disappeared into the night.
1:9:50|1:9:55|The scene shifts to a right hand wrapped in burlap, struggling to chop wood with the index finger.
1:9:55|1:9:58|He then turned the machete towards his left hand.
1:9:58|1:10:0|Soon, the firewood was split open.
1:10:3|1:10:8|[Ouyang Feng], who was eating watermelon, stopped and spat out the watermelon seeds in his mouth, licking his lips.
1:10:34|1:10:37|Shortly after, [Ouyang Feng] got up and walked outside.
1:10:58|1:11:6|A few days later, [Ouyang Feng] arrived at the intersection with a heavy expression on his face, looking serious as he gazed at the red paint about to be left behind.
1:11:13|1:11:14|He turned around and pulled up the road.
1:11:44|1:11:49|In the scene, [Hong Qi] is leading a camel through the desert, with his wife sitting on the camel's hump.
1:11:49|1:11:53|[Ouyang Feng] stood on a high place, looking at their departing figures from afar.
1:11:53|1:11:58|Hong Qi and the other person gradually walked away, soon reaching a shady spot under a tree.
1:11:58|1:12:3|But they did not stop at all, but continued to move forward on the unknown path.
1:12:3|1:12:13|At this moment, [Ouyang Feng] still stood in place, his hair being blown even more disorderly by the high winds sweeping through. The tattered flag above his head also swayed freely with the powerful gusts.
1:12:14|1:12:18|He then turned around and looked back for a moment before returning.
1:12:18|1:12:25|A large dark cloud was rapidly approaching the clear sky, and the fierce wind in the desert was even stronger than on the mountain tops.
1:12:25|1:12:32|At this moment, [Hong Qi]'s figure was shrouded in the sandstorm, he frowned and looked back at the place he had lived for a long time.
1:12:45|1:12:51|[Hong Qi] and his wife gradually walked away, their figures appearing particularly small in the vast desert.
1:12:51|1:12:57|Even if there is a violent gale blocking their way ahead, they will not stop their steps against the wind.
1:13:26|1:13:45|In the scene, a woman stands alone on a high mountain ridge. The time goes back to the night of her wedding day. The woman is dressed in a wedding gown, holding a candle as she quietly approaches a house. Just before entering, she adjusts her hair, then without hesitation, she pushes open the door and takes a peek inside.
1:13:46|1:13:53|He looked left and right through the crack in the door, then closed it after a while. The woman stood in front of the door for a moment, then turned back.
1:13:53|1:14:2|As he was about to leave, he suddenly stopped and glanced back quietly. He saw the woman's eyes rolling rapidly, her mind also racing in deep thought.
1:14:2|1:14:5|He then quickly crossed the corridor with a candle in hand.
1:14:6|1:14:15|Before long, the woman arrived at another corridor. She moved lightly and swiftly, turning at the corner while keeping her eyes fixed on the ground below.
1:14:15|1:14:23|Soon, she arrived at the staircase, where she was seen holding onto the handrail with one hand and carrying a bamboo stool with the other, swiftly moving her legs downstairs.
1:14:23|1:14:37|Halfway there, the woman suddenly stopped, raised the hand holding the bamboo platform forward, roughly observing the surrounding environment. The young [Ouyang Feng] hid in the shadows, quietly watching the woman's every move. The woman turned back and went upstairs again, preparing to leave.
1:14:37|1:14:44|[Ouyang Feng] looked at her, and couldn't help but think of the night of their wedding.
1:15:5|1:15:13|The woman resisted [Ouyang Feng]'s rough behavior, and the bamboo tray in her hand was also thrown out, falling to the ground upstairs, making a clattering sound.
1:15:13|1:15:18|At this moment, a man is seen washing a handkerchief in the water by the lake.
1:15:18|1:15:27|Previously, the woman that [Huang Yaoshi] went to find was looking at that person from a distance. The camera gradually moved up, only to see that the person washing the handkerchief was [Ouyang Feng].
1:15:27|1:15:31|He noticed the girl staring at him, then walked calmly in front of her.
1:15:42|1:15:56|[Ouyang Feng] hesitated for a moment after hearing this, not knowing how to respond. It turned out that the person standing in front of him was the wife of the man who died in the desert. The woman's face appeared and disappeared in the moonlight, her eyes fixed on the gold ingot in [Ouyang Feng]'s hand.
1:15:56|1:16:2|She then turned around and lay on the horse's belly, twisting her head towards the side without light.
1:16:4|1:16:7|Ouyang Feng, after listening, walked beside him and handed over the Han gold.
1:16:16|1:16:21|The woman did not look back, silently took the handkerchief from him and wiped away her tears.
1:16:21|1:16:24|He tightly clenched the Han gold, his fingers constantly grinding and shrinking.
1:16:24|1:16:27|After a moment, he lowered his head, preparing to leave.
1:16:30|1:16:36|The woman's face showed not sorrow but numbness, with her hair casually falling on her face.
1:16:38|1:16:43|There were no peach blossoms in this place to begin with. "Peach Blossom" is just a woman's name.
1:16:43|1:16:48|The calm lake surface is covered with a thin layer of cool mist, like a faint blue sand.
1:16:48|1:16:54|After returning home, the woman named Tao Hua tightly hugged the horse's neck, releasing the pain in her heart.
1:17:19|1:17:23|The rolling waves are surging towards the endless horizon in the scene.
1:17:41|1:17:44|A child squats by the shore, quietly gazing at the sea.
1:17:44|1:17:48|At this moment, [Ouyang Feng]'s sister-in-law leaned her upper body against the window, staring straight outside.
1:18:3|1:18:4|Huang Yaoshi was peeling while talking.
1:18:38|1:18:43|Ouyang Feng's sister-in-law turned around and lightly tapped her fingers on the windowsill.
1:19:5|1:19:9|His face showed a proud and aloof expression, but his eyes were moist.
1:19:37|1:19:43|[Huang Yaoshi] opened his mouth and took a bite of the freshly peeled pear, but his eyes were fixed on [Ouyang Feng]'s sister-in-law.
1:19:43|1:19:47|The sunlight outside the window shines on her, making her look particularly gentle.
1:21:9|1:21:18|His eyes were clear and beautiful, gazing at the distant scenery. There was a hint of melancholy on his elegant and graceful face, and the flower in his hand was already in a sorry state.
1:21:50|1:22:5|If one could start over, transcending the mundane and not seeking pleasure, often one cannot regret after the fact. The time that has passed is like irretrievable water, disappearing in the blink of an eye at the fingertips. Now he understands that some emotions, once missed, are lost for a lifetime.
1:22:5|1:22:12|He leaned lightly against the window frame, his eyes dimmed, then couldn't help but let out a deep sigh.
1:22:13|1:22:30|Not long after, he turned his head to the other side, his hand holding the wilted flower weakly hanging by his side. Then he stood up, took heavy steps towards the nearby carpet. On the table, there was a mirror placed. He slowly knelt down and then collapsed to sit on the side.
1:22:30|1:22:33|He then started tidying up his messy hair in front of the mirror.
1:22:35|1:22:42|He raised his hand, tucked a strand of hair behind his ear, and gently pushed the loose hair back into his hairline.
1:22:42|1:22:47|He then slightly turned sideways and began to tidy up the stray hairs on the other side.
1:23:3|1:23:8|He was puzzled for a few seconds, then turned back and smiled.
1:23:12|1:23:19|He wanted to say something more, but helplessly turned his head, tears streaming uncontrollably.
1:23:19|1:23:26|He regretfully scratched his messy hair with his hands, eyes closed, remorseful for everything he had done in the past.
1:23:26|1:23:34|The silent pain weighed heavily on him, leaving him exhausted. He shook his head heavily, and tears rolled down his cheeks.
1:23:34|1:23:39|The tears are filled with complex emotions, a mix of sadness and a sense of helplessness at the hands of fate.
1:23:58|1:24:19|The lake water flows day after day, and time passes by. [Ouyang Feng]'s sister-in-law still leans by the window as usual, but this time she is holding a beautiful flower. Her face is delicately made up, but it cannot hide her exhaustion. Her eyes have lost their sparkle.
1:24:19|1:24:26|Her eyes lost their former color, like a ruin worn down by time, and finally she slowly closed her eyes.
1:24:57|1:25:3|In the scene, [Ouyang Feng]'s sister-in-law closes her eyes tightly, with a hint of resignation on her lips.
1:25:3|1:25:7|After that day, [Huang Yaoshi] also left this place.
1:25:49|1:25:52|After the spring, it soon came to Jing Shi.
1:25:52|1:25:56|Every year at this time, a friend comes to visit me.
1:25:59|1:26:11|[Ouyang Feng] stood at the door, wiping the alcohol smell off his hands with a handkerchief. He then took a deep breath and continued to wipe, but his eyes kept glancing towards the other side of the desert.
1:26:11|1:26:21|He stood there waiting until nightfall, but his friend never came. Time passed like sand blown away by the wind, silently slipping away.
1:28:13|1:28:20|In his youth, Ouyang Feng may have already destined the tragedy of this love when he left White Camel Mountain.
1:30:29|1:30:33|Before leaving, [Ouyang Feng] set fire to his own inn.
1:30:33|1:30:37|The flames released by the roaring fire were like a phoenix breaking through the clouds.
1:30:37|1:30:47|The crazy waves of fire, one after another, burning everything here recklessly.
1:31:10|1:31:16|Endless sandy soil spreads across this boundless land, with bare sand and gravel everywhere.
1:31:16|1:31:29|The sky was filled with white mist, obscuring everything from view, only the outlines of layers of trees could be seen in the distance. That touch of vitality, different from the desert, injected life into the originally silent sand sea.
1:31:29|1:31:38|[Murong Yan] returned to the lakeside where he once met him, but there was only his lonely reflection in the lake. It was at this moment that he truly felt the essence of loneliness.
1:31:39|1:31:47|Years later, [Ouyang Feng] encountered a group of adventurers, led by a man whose weapon was different from others - a dog-beating staff.
1:31:47|1:31:53|After several rounds, [Ouyang Feng] remained unscathed, the man looked up with a look of astonishment.
1:32:1|1:32:17|At the same time, a swordsman with an oiled-paper umbrella flew in, holding a sword in one hand and the umbrella handle in the other as he descended from the sky. In an instant, blood splattered everywhere, and the person in male attire was none other than [Murong Yan].
1:32:17|1:32:26|The scene shifts, and [Murong Yan] is seen sitting in a pile of chili peppers in a long dress, completely immersed in a frenzied state. She looks up at the sky with a melancholic expression in her eyes.
1:32:30|1:32:43|Years later, [Ouyang Feng] achieved great success through rigorous martial arts training. He showed no mercy when facing enemies and was willing to pay any price to achieve his goals. He was one of the top martial artists in the world and was known as the Western Venom by people in the martial arts community.
