0:1:56|0:2:1|At this moment, a handsome man and a beautiful woman are flirting in a high-end restaurant.
0:2:4|0:2:21|The man politely took the menu from the waiter's hand and flipped through a few pages with ease.
0:2:21|0:2:31|He closed the menu and looked at the girl opposite with concern, while the girl rested her chin on her hand and nodded admiringly.
0:2:35|0:2:44|The man evenly sprinkled pepper into the soup, then carefully added a few drops of fish sauce, while the girl still propped up her chin, looking at the man with a smile.
0:2:47|0:2:49|The man smiled and scooped a spoonful of soup, handing it to her.
0:2:54|0:2:59|After the girl took a sip, the man took back the spoon and finished the rest of the soup.
0:2:59|0:3:5|Soon after, the two drove on the road, with the girl sitting in the passenger seat, leaning easily on the man's shoulder.
0:3:5|0:3:13|When the man's hand skillfully moved towards the girl's thigh, the girl did not dodge, and even shyly threw herself into the man's arms.
0:3:13|0:3:20|At this moment, as the red light came on, the vehicles all stopped at the intersection, and the two of them took the opportunity to embrace and kiss as if no one else was around.
0:3:20|0:3:23|Suddenly, the jarring sound of brakes screeching filled the air, prompting the man to curiously stick his head out.
0:3:25|0:3:30|A crowd of people formed a circle not far away.
0:3:30|0:3:33|The man regained consciousness and drove forward.
0:3:33|0:3:40|In the circle surrounded by pedestrians, vegetables scattered on the ground, a catfish fell out of a plastic bag, emitting a silent gasp.
0:3:40|0:3:45|The woman surrounded by the group lies on the ground, her elegant skirt already soaked through with blood.
0:3:45|0:3:49|At this moment, Chen Jiaqiao and Yanzi arrived at a temple on the mountain.
0:3:49|0:3:53|The girl held three sticks of incense in her hand, raised them to her forehead, and bowed devoutly with her eyes closed.
0:4:25|0:4:37|The girl couldn't find Chen Jiaqiao's figure in the temple, she shook her arms in frustration and left the temple helplessly.
0:4:37|0:4:43|The girl's hand holding the phone slipped weakly, looking out at the night outside the window with melancholy.
0:4:45|0:4:53|Late at night, the girl in a flight attendant uniform hurriedly pulls a suitcase and rushes out of the departure hall. After exiting, she anxiously looks around.
0:5:7|0:5:12|At this moment, [Chen Jiaqiao] mischievously crouched behind the girl.
0:5:12|0:5:17|Suddenly, Chen Jiaqiao embraced Yanzi as she anxiously searched, and passionately kissed her.
0:5:19|0:5:32|On the way home, the girl clung to [Chen Jiaqiao] tightly like a koala, occasionally leaning towards his cheek. [Chen Jiaqiao] held the steering wheel without looking away, but easily brushed against her lips in response.
0:5:32|0:5:37|Soon, the door was opened and [Chen Jiaqiao] covered the girl's eyes with one hand, leading her inside.
0:5:42|0:5:51|After stopping, [Chen Jiaqiao] smiled and put down his hand, seeing the girl with a hat in the room open her eyes in joy and curiously looking into each room.
0:5:51|0:6:5|She turned around, sweetly kissed [Chen Jiaqiao], mischievously put her own empty city hat on his face, and then bounced away to open the balcony French window.
0:6:5|0:6:9|The man affectionately kissed the girl's cheek and then took out a property deed from his pocket.
0:6:13|0:6:18|The girl looking at the property deed was stunned, and after a long time, she looked up at [Luo Yi].
0:6:49|0:6:55|Looking at the girl pouting with a face full of grievances, the man helplessly pinched her chin.
0:6:55|0:6:59|In the late night, the girl was immersed in her dreams, letting out a restless sigh.
0:7:0|0:7:6|In the blink of an eye, another late night. The [flight attendants] walked out of the airport lobby in groups, pulling their suitcases.
0:7:6|0:7:15|A [flight attendant]'s boyfriend considerately carried the luggage and got on the car with his girlfriend, while the other staff members walked out chatting and laughing.
0:7:16|0:7:21|The girl stood alone at the door of the hall, pulling the suitcase without moving.
0:7:21|0:7:30|Obviously, the man did not come to pick her up this time. Just as she was about to leave alone with her head down, the [flight attendant] who had been taken away by her boyfriend returned once again.
0:7:34|0:7:40|[COCO] raised the wine glass and finished it in one gulp.
0:7:40|0:7:46|[COCO] raised the wine glass and drank it all in one gulp.
0:7:46|0:7:54|[COCO] raised the wine glass and drank it all in one gulp.
0:7:54|0:8:1|[COCO] raised the wine glass and finished it in one gulp.
0:8:18|0:8:24|At this moment, [COCO] was already half drunk, and excitedly lifted the wine glass again, taking a big sip.
0:8:24|0:8:29|In the early morning, the door of [COCO]'s room was opened, and someone walked in sleepily.
0:8:29|0:8:33|However, all of this did not wake up the hungover [COCO].
0:8:33|0:8:35|The first chapter of the film, setting the stage.
0:8:35|0:8:45|At this moment, [COCO] is still sound asleep, looking pure and serene. The person who came in seems reluctant to wake him up, half kneeling on the ground, picking up the scattered clothes of [COCO] one by one.
0:9:20|0:9:27|[Chen Jiaqiao] did not answer, but kept kissing [COCO]'s forehead repeatedly.
0:9:27|0:9:36|[Chen Jiaqiao] remained silent, easily approaching [COCO], only to be impatiently avoided by the other party.
0:9:40|0:9:44|[Chen Jiaqiao] turned around wearily and silently placed his hand over his eyes.
0:9:44|0:9:52|The next moment, [COCO] rushed into the kitchen, clumsily cracking eggs into the pot and haphazardly sprinkling seasonings inside.
0:9:53|0:9:58|[Chen Jiaqiao] lay on the sofa in the living room, looking very annoyed when he heard the phone ringing.
0:9:58|0:10:5|In the end, he took out his phone from his pocket, glanced at the caller ID, and then threw it onto the coffee table.
0:10:5|0:10:12|On the screen, the words "Yanzi calling" appeared. On the other side, COCO walked out of the kitchen with a freshly cooked instant noodle, smiling.
0:10:31|0:10:43|Please like, subscribe, share, and support the Mingjing and Diandian programs. [COCO] was about to step forward to check the incoming call display when suddenly enraged [Chen Jiaqiao] startled her.
0:10:43|0:10:51|[Chen Jiaqiao] slammed his face onto the ground, grabbed the phone on the table without hesitation, and shook off [COCO]'s hand to leave.
0:10:51|0:10:54|[COCO] was left sobbing helplessly.
0:10:54|0:11:0|After a long time, [COCO] knelt on the ground, slowly wiping away the soup and water with a towel and brush.
0:11:0|0:11:6|However, every time she wiped, she couldn't help but recall the scene just now, and she collapsed, lowering her head.
0:11:6|0:11:9|Suddenly, the sound outside the door caught the attention of [COCO].
0:11:9|0:11:12|However, when he looked up, he saw nothing at all.
0:11:12|0:11:17|[COCO] lowered her eyes and vigorously wiped the floor again.
0:11:17|0:11:21|However, the unidentified noise outside the house once again caught her attention.
0:11:21|0:11:26|Looking up again this time, Chen Jiaqiao still didn't see anything unusual.
0:11:33|0:11:39|[COCO] hurriedly walked towards the door, without seeing Jiaqiao's figure.
0:11:39|0:11:43|As she walked back in disappointment, she was startled by the sudden appearance of a woman.
0:11:43|0:11:47|[COCO] gave a perfunctory smile and was about to close the door.
0:12:7|0:12:12|The woman's pleading, full of affection, made [COCO] unable to refuse, so she had to let her in the house.
0:12:12|0:12:18|After the woman entered, she placed the thermos on the table and took a few steps forward at a steady pace.
0:12:18|0:12:24|She turned her head slightly to illuminate the bedroom for a moment, then casually observed the furnishings in the living room.
0:12:34|0:12:40|The woman knelt down without saying a word and skillfully wiped the floor with a rag.
0:12:40|0:12:44|[COCO] was at a loss, squatting on the side, only able to wash the detergent on the ground.
0:12:44|0:12:48|Suddenly, the woman stopped and picked up a photo of [COCO] and the two of them.
0:12:54|0:12:59|[COCO] frowned, took the photo frame from the woman's hand and placed it on the table, then continued to scrub the floor with her head down.
0:13:2|0:13:15|[COCO] said nothing, but the reddened eye sockets and tightly clenched lips spoke volumes.
0:13:15|0:13:18|The woman took out a tissue from her bag and gently wiped away [COCO]'s tears.
0:13:23|0:13:27|In the next moment, [COCO] was holding a thermos of soup and drinking it heartily.
0:14:5|0:14:9|The woman slowly straightened up and approached [COCO].
0:14:55|0:15:2|Gu Xiaofan and [COCO] hit it off at first sight and even went shopping together at the supermarket.
0:15:2|0:15:6|COCO handed a flower plate to [Gu Xiaofan].
0:15:6|0:15:12|Gu Xiaofan shook his head and put the plate back on the shelf, but COCO seemed reluctant and picked it up again.
0:15:21|0:15:30|[COCO] ultimately placed the floral plate back on the shelf.
0:15:30|0:15:34|That day, Chen Jiaqiao parked the car in front of the airport departure hall, anxiously looking around.
0:15:35|0:15:43|Upon seeing [COCO] come out, he immediately honked the horn, but [COCO] ignored him and continued to walk forward with the suitcase.
0:15:43|0:15:48|Jiaqiao quickly stopped the car and reached out his hands to block COCO's way.
0:16:0|0:16:4|[COCO] may have a frown on her face, but she can't hide the smile on her face.
0:16:4|0:16:10|As soon as they entered the house, they couldn't contain the passion in their hearts and kissed each other.
0:16:10|0:16:15|She threw away the hat in her hand, constantly rubbing Chen Jiaqiao's face, expressing her longing.
0:16:15|0:16:19|Suddenly, COCO pushed Chen Jiaqiao away as if she remembered something.
0:16:23|0:16:29|[COCO] pecked Chen Jiaqiao's lips like a dragonfly touching the water, then hurriedly slipped to the side and clumsily put on high heels.
0:16:44|0:17:3|[COCO] under the guidance of [Chen Jiaqiao], went to the supermarket and bought two large bags of ingredients. Excitedly, she ran back home. Taking advantage of the time when [Yanzi] was taking a shower, [COCO] rushed into the kitchen, put on an apron, took out several bowls and plates from the cupboard, then grabbed the cutting board from the table, and went to the outdoor sink.
0:17:3|0:17:4|She returned to the kitchen once again.
0:17:5|0:17:9|Take out the draining basket, quickly wash the vegetables clean, and take them out.
0:17:9|0:17:26|For the first time, [COCO] cooked a meal seriously for her boyfriend, making him both excited and nervous. He skillfully cut the onions into large pieces, prepared a series of seasonings such as ginger and garlic, carried the seasoning bowl back to the kitchen, closed the kitchen door tightly, and quietly dialed a phone number on his phone.
0:17:35|0:17:40|COCO blushed and pushed Chen Jiaqiao out of the kitchen, then closed the door again.
0:17:42|0:17:48|[Chen Jiaqiao] stood outside the kitchen like a mischievous child, holding a necklace in her hand.
0:17:48|0:17:55|Just as [COCO] was in a panic, he sneaked into the kitchen, wrapped his arms around [COCO], and carefully put the necklace on for the other person.
0:18:3|0:18:16|[COCO] kissed [Chen Jiaqiao] to comfort him, then playfully pushed him out of the kitchen again.
0:18:16|0:18:24|[COCO] was in a panic and accidentally cut herself several times with the scissors while rushing.
0:18:24|0:18:32|The thick soup in the clay pot is about to overflow. After lifting the lid, the lamb soup stewed with burnt sauce is appetizing.
0:18:32|0:18:41|At the dining table, Chen Jiaqiao picked up the clay pot and drank all the soup inside without leaving a drop, then looked at COCO coquettishly.
0:18:41|0:18:49|[Chen Jiaqiao] shook his head and rubbed against [COCO]'s chest, then lifted [COCO] up, with his legs still around his waist.
0:18:50|0:19:1|[COCO] lay delicately with a slender waist, [Chen Jiaqiao] effortlessly carried her into the bedroom, kissing each other along the way, filling the room with the scent of shadows.
0:19:1|0:19:9|Chen Jiaqiao's first dish is called Peppered Lamb Chops Treasure, not only delicious but also with aphrodisiac effects.
0:19:9|0:19:14|Chen Jiaqiao placed [COCO] on the bed and quickly took off his own clothes.
0:19:14|0:19:18|While the two were enjoying themselves, Jiaqiao's phone rang again.
0:19:20|0:19:26|At the same time, a strange woman holding a bowl of soup hung up the unanswered phone call.
0:19:26|0:19:32|The next day, in a bustling teahouse, a woman was skillfully brewing the tea in front of her.
0:19:32|0:19:40|Later, she lifted the teapot, raised and lowered it to pour water, repeating the motion three times, exactly like the memory of the phoenix nodding three times.
0:19:40|0:19:44|The tea maker is actually [Gu Xiaofan], who handed a handbag to [Coco] with force.
0:19:59|0:20:4|At the persuasion of [Gu Xiaofan], [COCO] went to the bathroom with her to change into a new dress.
0:20:4|0:20:12|The dark suspender dress set off [COCO]'s skin even whiter, and she twirled satisfactorily in front of the mirror.
0:20:12|0:20:16|[Chen Jiaqiao] had one hand on [COCO]'s chest and the other around her shoulder.
0:20:27|0:20:33|Since then, [COCO]'s first action upon returning home was to turn on the gas stove and cook a delicious dish according to the recipe.
0:21:27|0:21:34|[COCO] is unaware that the unfamiliar woman is carrying a pot of soup that bears a striking resemblance to Gu Xiaofan.
0:21:34|0:21:39|[COCO] failed to have an epiphany and return home, and ended up falling asleep on the dining table.
0:21:39|0:21:47|Chen Jiaqiao, who returned home late, tiptoed over and glanced at COCO, who was still half asleep, and then started to enjoy the feast in front of him.
0:21:47|0:21:50|Chen Jiaqiao took a spoonful of warm flowers and stuffed them into his mouth.
0:21:51|0:22:2|COCO, who was awakened by the crisp sound of dishes and chopsticks clinking in front of him, looked at his boyfriend [Luo Yi] happily eating in front of him, and he smiled contentedly.
0:22:15|0:22:33|At this moment, [Yanzi]'s home remains quiet and silent, with only a lamp on the stove still lit. The soft light shines on the boiling pot, and in the middle of the night, Jiaqiao seems to be awakened by the thunder, picking up a glass of water and drinking it quickly, while [COCO] remains sound asleep.
0:22:33|0:22:39|One day, [COCO] was tidying up the dishes and chopsticks when a sudden vibration of the phone made him stop his movements.
0:22:39|0:22:47|[COCO] touched the coat draped over the chair, confirmed that the sound came from his pocket, and carefully took out the phone from inside.
0:22:48|0:22:56|He glanced at the incoming call display, then turned back to [Chen Jiaqiao] who was sound asleep, and answered the phone.
0:22:56|0:23:10|The other party not only did not respond, but also hung up the phone. Curious, [COCO] glanced at [Chen Jiaqiao] and then redialed the number.
0:23:10|0:23:17|The lonely telephone rings in the empty room, with no one answering it. Helpless [COCO] has no choice but to hang up the phone.
0:23:23|0:23:29|COCO, who had just finished work, didn't have time to change into her flight attendant uniform, so she hurriedly made an appointment with Gu Xiaofan to pick up a food box.
0:23:29|0:23:32|This is the third dish prepared for [Chen Jiaqiao] - steamed hairy crabs.
0:23:32|0:23:36|The meat of hairy crabs is fat, fresh, and delicious, tonifying the channels and collaterals, consolidating essence, clearing heat, and detoxifying.
0:23:36|0:23:41|[COCO] quickly took the delicious food out of the lunch box and placed it on the plate, then hurriedly hid the lunch box in the cupboard.
0:23:57|0:24:1|That day, [Chen Jiaqiao] and [Yanzi] were playing doubles tennis in the gym.
0:24:1|0:24:6|[COCO] and [Chen Jiaqiao] cooperate seamlessly, and soon they shout loudly.
0:24:6|0:24:11|Jiaqiao watched as COCO caught the ball attentively, then playfully used the racket to pat COCO's bottom.
0:24:11|0:24:15|Jiaqiao suddenly changed her expression, trembling as she crouched down.
0:24:28|0:24:33|Chen Jiaqiao lifted his head in pain, for a moment not knowing where he was, feeling only a dizzying sensation of the world spinning around him.
0:24:33|0:24:37|[COCO] suddenly realized something was wrong and quickly hugged him.
0:24:37|0:24:55|[COCO] was about to answer the phone, but was still blocked by Chen Jiaqiao's frowning.
0:25:5|0:25:10|Jiaqiao intended to comfort [COCO] with a kiss, but was avoided by the other party discontentedly.
0:25:10|0:25:16|Chen Jiaqiao didn't insist anymore, picked up the tennis bag and walked towards the door, leaving only [COCO] behind.
0:25:16|0:25:25|And [COCO], like a little girl, quickly put aside the negative emotions and happily went shopping with Gu Xiaofan in a few supermarkets.
0:25:25|0:25:29|Gu Xiaofan pointed at the fish in the water tank, smiling with a deep meaning.
0:25:29|0:25:31|Back home, the hyperactive fish flopped onto the ground.
0:25:32|0:25:35|[COCO] was so scared that she jumped up and almost fell down.
0:25:35|0:25:40|Gu Xiaofan was lying on the ground desperately grabbing, and the two of them laughed heartily.
0:25:40|0:25:51|Gu Xiaofan is obviously an experienced cook. He slices the shredded potatoes quickly and evenly, carefully removes the seeds from the bell peppers, and even cuts the scallions into different shapes according to their different uses.
0:25:51|0:25:58|After seasoning the fish, Chen Jiaqiao skillfully cut it into beautiful flower patterns, and then evenly spread the beaten egg mixture on the fish.
0:25:58|0:26:3|After the oil in the pot reached a certain temperature, she slid the fish in along the edge of the pot.
0:26:3|0:26:11|This is the fourth dish, stewed catfish with sea cucumber, sweet in taste and warm in nature, nourishing the middle and benefiting yang.
0:26:13|0:26:18|[COCO] immediately dropped the kitchen utensils and ran out of the kitchen with a big smile on her face.
0:26:32|0:26:42|In the gap while waiting for the elevator, the two of them kissed as if no one else was around, while at home Gu Xiaofan calmly poured the fermented black beans all over himself, and neatly brought it to the dining table.
0:26:42|0:26:42|After entering the elevator, [Chen Jiaqiao], [Yanzi], COCO, and [Luo Yi]...
0:26:54|0:27:2|At the same time, Chen Jiaqiao calmly tidied up the dining table, even pouring two cups of white wine, looking every bit like a hostess.
0:27:2|0:27:8|Jiaqiao and [COCO] passionately kissed until the elevator's arrival signal interrupted their passion.
0:27:8|0:27:15|[COCO] took the lead out of the elevator, tossing her hair back seductively and effortlessly putting the glasses back on Chen Jiaqiao.
0:27:28|0:27:32|[COCO] excitedly ducked into the kitchen, only to find that Chen Jiaqiao was nowhere to be seen.
0:27:32|0:27:39|She picked up the apron and pouted, unable to resist dialing the phone.
0:28:1|0:28:7|[COCO] hung up the phone with a smile, as if remembering something joyful, and left a message to slip out of the kitchen.
0:28:7|0:28:13|At this moment, Gu Xiaofan, with a cold expression, walked out of the elevator, completely different from her usual gentle smile.
0:28:17|0:28:21|Chen Jiaqiao immediately lifted the heavy oven and walked towards the kitchen.
0:28:21|0:28:24|As soon as [Chen Jiaqiao] entered the kitchen, an unexpected incident occurred.
0:28:34|0:28:39|Later, Chen Jiaqiao was taken to the hospital and underwent various tests with different instruments.
0:28:39|0:28:45|From CT scans to MRI, every possible area that can be checked has been meticulously examined.
0:29:8|0:29:19|[COCO] carefully studied the recipe, occasionally lifting the lid to check the status of the stew.
0:29:22|0:29:25|Chen Jiaqiao rubbed his eyes listlessly, looking like he couldn't wake up.
0:29:25|0:29:36|[COCO] placed the soup in front of him, affectionately kissing his forehead, while [Chen Jiaqiao] only took a few sips before furrowing his brow and absentmindedly pushing the food around in his mouth.
0:29:38|0:29:44|[COCO] approached in confusion, with a few broken strands of hair floating on the tip of the spoon.
0:29:44|0:29:48|He looked at [Chen Jiaqiao] again, and was instantly shocked.
0:29:51|0:30:6|[Jiaqiao] touched his eyebrows, only to find that they easily fell off. In a panic, he couldn't listen to any of [Coco]'s comforting words. He stood up and rushed into the bathroom. Almost pressing his face against the mirror, he stared at himself for a long time before couldn't help but reach out and pull at his right eyebrow.
0:30:7|0:30:15|Before he even exerted any force, a clump of hair was plucked from between his fingers. He stubbornly tugged at the left eyebrow, twisting the hair around his finger in an instant.
0:30:15|0:30:22|Even more terrifying, when [Chen Jiaqiao] was taking a bath, she found that the amount of hair falling in the bathtub seemed as if it had been cut by someone.
0:30:22|0:30:30|He incredulously scooped out the hair, grabbed a handful on his head, and [Chen Jiaqiao] couldn't help but tremble, leaning weakly against the wall with his hands full of hair.
0:30:30|0:30:34|He frantically splashed water on his head and kept rubbing it.
0:30:34|0:30:44|After the breakdown, [Chen Jiaqiao] hugged her head, dried off the water droplets on the mirror after showering, ran her fingers through her hair again, as expected, her hand was full once more.
0:30:44|0:30:48|[COCO] couldn't help but walk in when she saw the mirror covered with hair.
0:30:59|0:31:5|Jiaqiao weakly leaned on [COCO] as if clinging to the last straw for help.
0:31:5|0:31:9|Upon hearing the nurse's call, [Chen Jiaqiao] walked into the examination room dejectedly.
0:31:9|0:31:12|A male doctor uses tweezers to continuously pluck out Jiaqiao's hair.
0:31:23|0:31:26|Extract several active hair follicles from the patient's subcutaneous tissue.
0:31:38|0:31:39|The inflammation runs deep.
0:31:49|0:31:59|At this moment, [Yanzi] is still guarding the lonely stove.
0:31:59|0:32:2|After lifting the lid, a thick steam rushed out.
0:32:2|0:32:9|[COCO] stood in her own kitchen, pondered for half an hour, then took out her phone and dialed a number.
0:32:53|0:33:2|Later, the Chinese doctor had Jiaqiao lie on the bed and applied several fire cups to his back to detoxify, followed by acupuncture treatment.
0:33:2|0:33:6|Before long, thin and long needles were inserted into the head, like a hedgehog.
0:33:6|0:33:10|Suddenly, a stream of blood flowed down the forehead, making [Chen Jiaqiao] both shocked and scared.
0:33:39|0:33:49|[Chen Jiaqiao] rushed out of the traditional Chinese medicine shop, pushing away [COCO]'s arm, and walked down the stairs without looking back, leaving her standing there alone feeling wronged.
0:34:9|0:34:14|Gu Xiaofan handed a freshly brewed cup of tea to [COCO] with a smile.
0:34:40|0:34:46|Gu Xiaofan smiled meaningfully and gently pushed the stone box towards [COCO].
0:34:46|0:34:49|After the conversation, Gu Xiaofan left again on the light rail.
0:34:49|0:34:57|Before the vehicle started, he waved to [COCO], but [COCO] seemed to still be immersed in the struggle with [Chen Jiaqiao], a little distracted.
0:34:57|0:34:58|Soon.
0:35:0|0:35:11|[COCO] carried a huge stone box on her arm, walking casually. Suddenly, she stopped in front of a bookstore, furrowing her brow in hesitation for a few seconds before absentmindedly stepping into the shop.
0:35:11|0:35:18|After a search, she pulled out a copy of "Daily Gourmet" edited by Gu Xiaofan from the bookshelf corner in the living cooking area.
0:35:19|0:35:29|However, at the moment when flipping through the pages, [COCO] was stunned to see a photo of Gu Xiaofan in the book, realizing that the Gu Xiaofan he had recently been in contact with was not the same person.
0:35:36|0:35:43|[COCO] unbelievably flipped through the cover's name, then flipped the page again to look at the photo.
0:36:15|0:36:23|At this moment, a chill shot straight to his forehead, causing him to weakly lower his hand and slowly squat down against the wall of 1308.
0:36:23|0:36:33|At the same time, another family was energetically changing windows, and what was chilling was that Gu Xiaofan's stove and clay pot appeared in this family.
0:36:33|0:36:38|The person who has been pretending to be Gu Xiaofan is none other than Chen Jiaqiao's wife, [Yanzi].
0:36:38|0:36:43|At this moment, [Chen Jiaqiao] on the side is dressed in a casual home outfit, stretching lazily.
0:36:59|0:37:9|Upon seeing [Chen Jiaqiao] pick up the medicine bottle, [Yanzi] immediately set down the ingredients in her hand, grabbed a glass and went to fetch water. As [Chen Jiaqiao] reached out, the glass of water was smoothly placed into his hand.
0:37:13|0:37:19|[Chen Jiaqiao] finished the medicine, weakly coughed, and then impatiently glanced out the window.
0:37:19|0:37:26|On the other side, [COCO] kept flipping through two "Daily Gourmet" magazines, trying to find a clue.
0:37:26|0:37:32|[Yanzi] gently supports her chin with one hand, looking at [Chen Jiaqiao] in front of her, then picks up the chopsticks to prepare to pick up some food as well.
0:37:32|0:37:40|Suddenly, [Chen Jiaqiao] put down the chopsticks in her hand, took out a delicate velvet jewelry box from under the table, opened it, and handed it to [Yanzi].
0:37:46|0:37:55|[Yanzi] ignored [Chen Jiaqiao]'s fake smile, staring expressionlessly at the necklace in front of him before reaching out to take it after a long pause.
0:37:55|0:38:4|[Chen Jiaqiao] smiled and lowered her head, took a few bites of rice, while [Yanzi] slowly took out a necklace from the box, but hesitated to put it on.
0:38:4|0:38:14|[Chen Jiaqiao] stood up again after seeing the situation, walked around behind [Yanzi], took the necklace from her hands, carefully unfastened the clasp, and gently put it around [Yanzi]'s neck.
0:38:14|0:38:19|But [Yanzi]'s expression remained indifferent, showing no signs of joy.
0:38:19|0:38:25|Yanzi finally showed a hint of a smile when Chen Jiaqiao pulled her into his arms and kissed her.
0:38:25|0:38:28|[Jiaqiao] gently pressed her shoulder to comfort her, then sat back in her seat.
0:38:29|0:38:38|[Yanzi] caressed the pendant on her collarbone, still lost in thought with an expressionless face, then the two continued to peacefully have lunch.
0:38:45|0:38:57|[Yanzi] focused on peeling the shrimp in her hand, as if it was just a casual remark. [Chen Jiaqiao] paused for a moment, then set down her chopsticks, took out a tissue, wiped her mouth leisurely, and leaned towards [Yanzi].
0:39:2|0:39:19|[Yanzi] still showed no emotion, but instead dipped the peeled shrimp in sauce and handed it to [Chen Jiaqiao]'s mouth.
0:39:19|0:39:27|[Chen Jiaqiao] opened his mouth without hesitation, swallowed the shrimp, and also touched [Yanzi]'s fingers.
0:39:27|0:39:29|[Yanzi] carefully helps [Chen Jiaqiao] put on his coat.
0:39:40|0:39:45|[Yanzi], like every virtuous wife, helps her husband tie his tie.
0:39:45|0:39:48|After tidying up her clothes neatly, [Chen Jiaqiao] watched her walk out of the door.
0:39:51|0:40:0|On the other side, [COCO] was not as leisurely, he kept staring at the computer screen without a moment's rest, searching for all the information about Gu Xiaofan.
0:40:0|0:40:5|However, no matter how he searched, the Gu Xiaofan on the food website was not the one he knew.
0:40:5|0:40:8|He tried his best to walk forward and stand up, even greeting his colleagues was very difficult for him.
0:40:31|0:40:41|[Chen Jiaqiao], wearing sunglasses, making it hard to see his expression. However, his complexion reveals a hint of illness, barely holding up. At this moment, the secretary also steps forward.
0:40:45|0:40:49|[Chen Jiaqiao] impatiently took the documents from the secretary and flipped through them as he walked.
0:40:49|0:40:59|Suddenly, he felt a dizzy spell and everything spinning around him. He stopped in his tracks, his eyes rolling uncontrollably upwards, and then he collapsed to the ground.
0:40:59|0:41:6|[Chen Jiaqiao] fell to the ground, foaming at the mouth and convulsing, with scattered documents all over the floor. The next moment, he was rushed to the hospital.
0:41:6|0:41:12|At this moment, [Chen Jiaqiao] on the emergency bed has long been unconscious, with traces of vomit still not cleaned up at the corner of his mouth.
0:41:13|0:41:22|The surgical lights in the operating room all lit up, and [Doctor] skillfully opened [Chen Jiaqiao]'s eyelids to observe the condition of the pupils, and the surgery proceeded in an orderly manner.
0:41:49|0:41:56|On screen, as a fan of [Luo Yi], [Yanzi] and [COCO] are tightly hugging each other, sending a chill down [COCO]'s spine.
0:42:58|0:43:1|[Yanzi] looked at [Chen Jiaqiao] lying on the sickbed, with a mocking smile on her face.
0:43:32|0:43:40|[Yanzi] looked at the attending physician of [Chen Jiaqiao], the sarcasm in her eyes vanished, replaced by deep concern and heaviness.
0:43:40|0:43:52|With an excellent professional background, [Yanzi] effortlessly took [Chen Jiaqiao] out of the hospital. [Yanzi] had her hair tied in a simple ponytail, wearing a chiffon shirt with partially exposed sleeves, showcasing her sexy shoulders.
0:43:53|0:43:58|His smile was satisfied and gloomy, and he wheeled [Chen Jiaqiao] out of the hospital with just one wheelchair.
0:43:58|0:44:3|At this moment, even though it's not yet autumn, [Chen Jiaqiao] is already wrapped in the coat of autumn.
0:44:3|0:44:8|He tilted his head, dozing off weakly, unaware of where he was.
0:44:8|0:44:14|And [Yanzi], seemingly tireless, pushed him out of the hospital and crossed numerous streets to reach the riverside.
0:44:15|0:44:21|Under the meticulous planning of [Yanzi], the man in front of her could no longer escape from her control.
0:44:21|0:44:26|And at this moment, [Chen Jiaqiao] was still unaware, still treating [Yanzi] as a lifesaving straw.
0:44:26|0:44:31|[Chen Jiaqiao] regained consciousness after boarding the boat, weakly holding the hand resting on their shoulder.
0:44:35|0:44:42|[Yanzi] squatted down and lightly rubbed her forehead against the side of [Chen Jiaqiao]'s face, as if none of this had ever happened.
0:44:42|0:44:46|Now, [Chen Jiaqiao] doesn't even have the strength to bathe himself.
0:44:46|0:44:49|He sat paralyzed in the bathtub, letting [Yanzi] wipe him.
0:45:4|0:45:17|Watching his wife tuck him in, [Chen Jiaqiao] couldn't help but move closer to her embrace. [Yanzi] gently stroked her husband's blanket and whispered softly in his ear.
0:45:55|0:45:58|Chen Jiaqiao and Monk Yan tightly hold Yanzi's hands.
0:46:2|0:46:7|[Yanzi] freed up one hand and brought the soup bowl, which had already been placed on the edge of the bathtub, in front of [Chen Jiaqiao].
0:46:7|0:46:11|[Chen Jiaqiao] showed no resistance, picked up the bowl of soup and started drinking heartily.
0:46:35|0:46:45|[COCO] did not bring the stone box, but hurriedly walked to the roadside, hailed a taxi, and immediately told the driver where she wanted to go.
0:46:45|0:46:51|[Yanzi] arrived at the old teahouse without suspecting anything.
0:46:59|0:47:4|[Yanzi] smiled and hung up the phone, without lingering in the teahouse, she got up and left directly.
0:47:4|0:47:9|Little did they know, [COCO] was sitting in the café downstairs, secretly watching her.
0:47:9|0:47:17|[Yanzi] saw [COCO] leaving her seat, lost in thought. Just as she turned to look outside the door, she saw [Luo Yi] walking towards the cafe.
0:47:17|0:47:21|[COCO] was immediately scared out of a cold sweat, and quickly pressed against the wall, covering her chest.
0:47:22|0:47:27|Fortunately, [Yanzi] just turned at the door and walked forward calmly.
0:47:27|0:47:36|[COCO] sat at the table, calmed down, confirmed that [Yanzi] had walked away, picked up the phone on the table, and sneakily slipped out of the café.
0:47:36|0:47:37|At this moment, she still didn't know,
0:47:37|0:47:44|This seemingly flawless tracking plan was completely exposed by [Yanzi] with just one phone call.
0:47:56|0:48:6|Yanzi, who hung up the phone, breathed a sigh of relief and glanced at the rearview mirror, only to see a taxi following her closely, while COCO was unaware that she had been discovered.
0:48:10|0:48:16|The taxi driver, true to his word, continued to follow [COCO] and eventually brought her to an underground parking garage.
0:48:16|0:48:20|[Yanzi] locked the car door and walked into the passage calmly.
0:48:20|0:48:24|Even slowed down, [COCO] disappeared just as Chen Jiaqiao got off the car.
0:48:24|0:48:29|[COCO] quickly ran into the passage after confirming that the car parked next to it was [Yanzi]'s car.
0:48:29|0:48:31|Arrived at the floor where [Yanzi] is located.
0:48:31|0:48:35|Even though the aisle was paved with understated luxury marble, she had no time to spare.
0:48:36|0:48:46|The door of Room 5201 on the right was not closed, but slightly ajar with a gap the width of a palm. [COCO] cautiously approached and peered through the gap, shining a light inside.
0:48:46|0:48:51|Suddenly, the door opened and [Yanzi] stood unabashedly at the doorway, smiling and greeting [COCO].
0:48:56|0:49:4|Faced with the invitation from [Yanzi], [COCO] hesitated greatly, but curiosity ultimately prevailed, leading her into the room.
0:49:4|0:49:11|After passing through the dim foyer, there was a wall-mounted open bookshelf, filled with photos of [Yanzi] and [Chen Jiaqiao].
0:49:11|0:49:16|[COCO] felt a chill run down her spine, unable to help but hug her arms tightly, echoing back with a sharp and probing question.
0:49:20|0:49:27|[Yanzi] stared at [Coco], explaining calmly, while [Coco] sat slumped at the dining table, looking incredulous.
0:49:50|0:50:2|At this moment, [Chen Jiaqiao] was leaning against the bedroom door, eavesdropping on the conversation between the two.
0:50:2|0:50:11|[COCO] looked pitiful in the face of adversity, only to be replaced by an expression of disbelief immediately.
0:50:11|0:50:16|[Yanzi] always had a smile on her face as she casually pushed a recipe book in front of [COCO].
0:50:50|0:50:55|Speak up, [Yanzi] has turned to the third page of the recipe again.
0:50:56|0:51:6|[COCO] looked at the recipe, lost in thought, vaguely remembering the steamed crab, the brightly colored stir-fried mushrooms, and feeding them to [Chen Jiaqiao] personally.
0:51:14|0:51:19|At the sight of this recipe, [COCO] immediately remembered the day when [Yanzi] came to help her cook fish at home.
0:51:19|0:51:28|The delicious catfish was placed on the family dining table, while the conflicting pig liver soup was also served on another table.
0:51:28|0:51:33|Chen Jiaqiao behind the door looked terrified, tightly covering his mouth to prevent making any noise.
0:52:24|0:52:32|The scene shifts to a supermarket, where the pregnant belly of [Yanzi] is prominently displayed, with the fetus clearly visible on the screen.
0:52:32|0:52:36|The nurses surrounded [Yanzi] with smiles, joyfully celebrating this young life.
0:52:37|0:52:42|[Yanzi] is beaming with a happy smile as she props herself up to feel the heartbeat of her child.
0:52:42|0:52:52|After the prenatal examination, she went to the market as usual, bought a catfish that [Chen Jiaqiao] loved to eat, picked some side dishes, and soon her hands were full.
0:52:53|0:53:0|However, as they were crossing the street and waiting for the traffic light, an unexpected sight appeared - the familiar vehicle was not far away.
0:53:0|0:53:6|After the car came to a stop, Chen Jiaqiao's pregnant wife witnessed with her own eyes the scene of her husband kissing another woman.
0:53:6|0:53:11|[Yanzi] was furious, staring fixedly at her own vehicle, and quickly walked towards the middle of the road.
0:53:11|0:53:16|However, at this moment, a truck came rushing in and knocked [Yanzi] down to the ground.
0:53:17|0:53:23|Surrounded by onlookers, even [Chen Jiaqiao] leaned out of the car window curiously to join the excitement.
0:53:23|0:53:27|The people around dared not move the pregnant woman easily, so they could only call and wait for the paramedics.
0:53:44|0:53:52|[Yanzi] lowered her eyes and quietly finished telling [COCO] everything, but when she looked up, her eyes were empty and lifeless.
0:53:58|0:54:12|[COCO] turned away from [Yanzi], tightly closed her eyes, letting tears slide down her cheeks, while Chen Jiaqiao sat on the ground, holding her head in regret.
0:54:12|0:54:19|Yanzi then invited COCO to visit another room. As COCO pushed the door open and entered, she fell into deep thought.
0:54:20|0:54:31|This is clearly a carefully arranged nursery, with wind chimes swaying at the door and butterfly decorations in the center, all showing Yanzi's expectations for this child.
0:54:31|0:54:49|[COCO], with red eyes, kept lighting up various toys prepared for the baby in the room, while [Yanzi] calmly leaned against the door, showing no intention of going in. When [COCO] picked up a pair of soft shoes, tears couldn't help but fall from her eyes, while [Yanzi], strong and with a hint of smile on her face.
0:55:7|0:55:11|[Yanzi] did not answer, but instead led her to the door at the entrance.
0:55:11|0:55:18|[COCO] kept her head down, lagging three or four steps behind [Yanzi], as if hesitating whether to take one last look at Chen Jiaqiao.
0:55:18|0:55:29|[Yanzi] glanced back at [COCO], then opened the door and left. As the door opened, [COCO] instinctively took a few steps forward, wanting to catch another glimpse of the person who had been on their mind day and night.
0:56:11|0:56:15|[COCO]'s confused steps came to a halt because of these words.
0:56:15|0:56:20|She looked at [Yanzi] in disbelief, then turned angrily and walked away.
0:56:20|0:56:24|Chen Jiaqiao still sat on the bed, tears streaming down silently.
0:56:24|0:56:27|[COCO] came out of [Yanzi]'s house and immediately went to get drunk with her best friend.
0:56:27|0:56:31|The two sat in front of the food stall, with seven or eight empty beer bottles on the table.
0:56:32|0:56:37|However, the emotionally unstable [COCO] had no intention of drinking, only focusing on eating and crying in pain.
0:56:37|0:56:45|The best friend did not dissuade, quietly drinking beer alone, accompanying [COCO].
0:56:45|0:56:51|After some time, the surrounding guests left one after another, and even the food stalls pulled down their shutters to prepare for rest.
0:56:51|0:56:58|At this moment, there were over a dozen bottles of alcohol on the table. While her friend [COCO] remained modestly sober, [COCO] had already passed out on the table.
0:57:20|0:57:28|The moment her best friend, [Yanzi], sensed something was wrong, she panicked. And when [COCO] woke up again, she found herself lying on a hospital bed.
0:57:28|0:57:40|Seeing [COCO] waking up, [Yanzi] breathed a sigh of relief, gently stroked her forehead and smiled.
0:57:40|0:57:42|At this moment, [Yanzi] is happily playing with a hamster.
0:57:45|0:57:51|The mischievous hamster is locked in a wheel, as he runs, the wheel spins rapidly.
0:57:51|0:57:59|[Chen Jiaqiao] sat quietly on the side, suppressing the fear in his heart, holding [Yanzi]'s hand tightly, discussing with the kind-hearted.
0:57:59|0:58:5|Yanzi's smile froze on her face, ignoring Chen Jiaqiao, who couldn't help but move closer.
0:58:9|0:58:17|[Yanzi] still ignored him, focusing on the hamster in front of her, occasionally playing with the cage to make the hamster run faster.
0:58:30|0:58:41|After a long time, [Yanzi]'s gaze finally left the hamster in front of her. She slowly raised her head, looked at the serious [Chen Jiaqiao], and smiled gently, making one's whole body feel fuzzy.
0:58:45|0:58:50|[Yanzi] stared fixedly at [Chen Jiaqiao], causing [Chen Jiaqiao] to involuntarily take a step back in fear.
0:58:50|0:58:58|Sensing the other's emotions, [Yanzi] smiled and held his hand back in an attempt to comfort him, but a tear silently slid down her cheek.
0:59:1|0:59:10|[Yanzi] spoke gently but firmly, holding a bowl of soup in her right hand and gripping [Chen Jiaqiao]'s chin with her left hand, then poured the soup directly into his mouth.
0:59:10|0:59:15|At this moment, [Chen Jiaqiao] was like a hamster trapped in a wheel, at the mercy of [Yanzi].
0:59:16|0:59:25|That day, [Chen Jiaqiao] lay naked and confused in the bathtub, covering his face with both hands, seemingly unable to accept this state of life.
0:59:25|0:59:30|With both hands slowly dropping down, his gaze focused on the wedding ring on the ring finger of his left hand.
0:59:30|0:59:36|[Chen Jiaqiao] took it off, held it up to the top of his head and stared at it for a long time, with a timid anger in his eyes.
0:59:36|0:59:40|In the end, he released his fingers and let the wedding ring fall into the water.
0:59:46|0:59:56|At this moment, [Yanzi] was standing in front of the stove as usual, making porridge. When she saw the incoming call on her phone, she rolled her eyes lightly and impatiently answered the call.
1:0:11|1:0:14|[Yanzi] looked up, as if pondering something.
1:0:14|1:0:21|[Chen Jiaqiao] now leads a reclusive life, pulling the curtains tightly shut to shroud the living room in darkness.
1:0:21|1:0:30|Chen Jiaqiao lay on the sofa, weakly reaching out to pick up the telephone receiver. However, after putting it to his ear and listening for a moment, there was no sound at all.
1:0:30|1:0:38|[Chen Jiaqiao] only then realized that all the telephone lines had been cut by [Yanzi]. He reached out and wound the telephone line around a few times, pulling it down to the ground with force.
1:0:48|1:0:54|COCO remained silent for a long time, and Yanzi looked up at him calmly.
1:1:35|1:1:40|Chen Jiaqiao angrily pulled open the curtains, and the glaring sunlight immediately flooded the entire room.
1:1:40|1:1:46|He tried to open the window, undoubtedly failed, and the phone he was holding had already had its battery removed by [Yanzi].
1:1:46|1:1:51|He raised his arm in resignation and symbolically tapped the glass a few times in a struggle.
1:1:52|1:1:56|Upon entering the room, there was originally only a door lock, but now an additional password lock has been added.
1:1:56|1:2:0|Now he doesn't even have the strength to walk to the door.
1:2:0|1:2:5|He sat in a wheelchair, desperately hitting the door, but it had no effect.
1:2:5|1:2:10|He had no choice but to turn the wheelchair around and slide towards the living room.
1:2:10|1:2:15|Chen Jiaqiao is seen spinning in circles in the small area of the living room in his wheelchair.
1:2:25|1:2:36|Chen Jiaqiao mustered up the last bit of strength to stand up, lifting the wheelchair with all his might and smashing it against the window. However, the window had been replaced with bulletproof glass, unmoved by his efforts.
1:2:36|1:2:42|[COCO] was crying sadly when suddenly her expression changed.
1:2:42|1:2:53|At the moment when he ran towards the toilet, covering his mouth and retching, a crack finally appeared on the usually calm face of [Yanzi].
1:3:8|1:3:14|At this moment, [COCO] finally realized the true identity of [Yanzi] and couldn't help but widen her eyes.
1:3:14|1:3:24|At this moment, [Chen Jiaqiao] was squatting by the edge of the bathtub, lost in thought. He stared motionlessly at the ventilation opening on the window, which was almost his only way out.
1:3:24|1:3:33|He immediately gathered up the white paper scattered on the living room floor. Without a pen, he could only bite his finger in distress and write the final life-saving message with blood.
1:3:34|1:3:39|Before long, the words "help 5201" were written on several pieces of white paper.
1:3:39|1:3:47|The blood on his fingers dried up, and he bit down even harder, not daring to stop even with a mouth full of blood.
1:3:47|1:3:57|[Chen Jiaqiao] seemed to see the hope of freedom. After writing on all the white papers, he carefully folded them into paper airplanes and then stuffed them out through the gaps between the fan blades of the ventilation duct.
1:3:58|1:4:8|At this moment, [Chen Jiaqiao]'s heart was swaying more severely than the paper airplane in the air. He pressed himself against the glass window, trying hard to observe the trajectory of the plane's descent.
1:4:8|1:4:13|At this moment, the children playing downstairs seemed to have discovered a new continent, all gathering towards a vacant lot.
1:4:18|1:4:27|Unfortunately, [Yanzi]'s car happened to pass by here. She looked at the group of children holding paper airplanes, rolled down the window, and a hint of coldness appeared in her eyes.
1:4:27|1:4:32|Later, [Yanzi] carried the skirt and stone box that [COCO] had returned, and walked back home.
1:4:32|1:4:37|She remained calm, and even the floor cleaner didn't notice anything unusual.
1:4:37|1:4:42|At this moment, [Chen Jiaqiao] crouched by the gate, and upon hearing the sound of the door opening, she decisively lifted her head.
1:5:13|1:5:22|[Yanzi] calmly explained everything, staring at Baojie with a cautious look, while getting up and dragging [Chen Jiaqiao] by the legs into the room.
1:5:22|1:5:28|P&G also didn't want to cause trouble, glanced around and quickly retreated around the corner, continuing to work hard dragging the corridor.
1:5:28|1:5:33|After closing the door, [Yanzi] quickly turned both locks and set a new passcode.
1:5:35|1:5:46|In the dimly lit living room, [Chen Jiaqiao] sat in a wheelchair, his arms securely tied to the armrests. He choked back tears, trying to break free, but the ropes remained unmoved. At that moment, [Yanzi] slowly squatted in front of him.
1:5:54|1:5:59|[Chen Jiaqiao] let out a sigh, looking at his wife who had turned into a demon in front of him, feeling like crying but unable to shed tears.
1:5:59|1:6:5|[Yanzi] clasped [Chen Jiaqiao]'s hand devoutly, slipping the wedding ring she had long abandoned back onto her left ring finger.
1:6:5|1:6:8|Now, [Chen Jiaqiao] has long given up struggling.
1:6:8|1:6:9|Chapter Two: Trap.
1:6:12|1:6:20|The elevator doors opened, revealing [COCO] with a slight bulge in her abdomen. She had a handbag slung over her right shoulder and was holding a suitcase with her left hand, looking exhausted as she leaned against the inside wall in a daze.
1:6:20|1:6:25|After coming to her senses, she forced herself to stand up, holding back the tears welling up in her eyes, and walked towards the elevator. 
1:6:31|1:6:38|[COCO] picked up the phone, stared at the caller ID, remained silent for a while, and then continued to walk forward with heavy steps.
1:6:38|1:6:43|However, the other party had no intention of hanging up the phone, the annoying ringing continued to echo in the ears.
1:6:43|1:6:47|[COCO] took a few more steps and finally stopped in a dejected manner.
1:7:50|1:7:53|[COCO] closed her eyes tightly, letting tears flow down.
1:7:53|1:7:57|This man always manages to break through his inner defenses in the fastest way.
1:7:57|1:8:1|He cried uncontrollably, only able to support his forehead to ease his emotions.
1:8:1|1:8:4|In the end, [COCO] chose to go see [Chen Jiaqiao] one last time.
1:8:4|1:8:10|In the taxi on the way to the other party's home, [COCO] took out her phone, found her friend Zhang Qing's number, and dialed it.
1:8:10|1:8:17|However, at this moment, Chen Jiaqiao and her police boyfriend are on a date at the cinema, happily snuggled together eating popcorn.
1:8:17|1:8:20|Completely oblivious to this life-saving call.
1:8:20|1:8:32|The phone call went unanswered, leaving [COCO] feeling uneasy. After sending a text message, he hurriedly rushed to the doorstep of [Chen Jiaqiao]'s house. Just like last time, the door was still half open, but inside was eerily quiet.
1:8:33|1:8:40|[Coco] stood at the door calling tentatively, and after receiving no response, took a few steps forward.
1:8:40|1:8:47|[COCO] cautiously pushed open the door, but still did not see the figure that haunted her dreams.
1:8:47|1:8:52|She couldn't hide the worry on her face and took a few steps back inside.
1:8:52|1:8:59|At this moment, [COCO] stood by the living room, shining around looking for [Chen Jiaqiao]'s figure, but still found nothing.
1:9:4|1:9:9|[COCO] stood by the wall, feeling that something was not quite right.
1:9:9|1:9:13|However, without waiting for him to react, [Yanzi] covered [Coco]'s mouth and nose with a towel from behind.
1:9:13|1:9:14|Jiaqiao looked expressionlessly at the unconscious COCO in the distance.
1:9:38|1:9:46|[COCO] suddenly woke up at this moment.
1:9:46|1:9:50|[Yanzi] crossed her arms and leisurely approached Chen Jiaqiao.
1:9:58|1:10:9|[Yanzi] held Chen Jiaqiao's face and roared wildly, a scene that sent shivers down COCO's spine. She scrambled to her feet and ran towards the door in a panic, with [Yanzi] in the living room hearing the commotion and quickly following suit.
1:10:9|1:10:15|Chen Jiaqiao took this opportunity to break free from the ropes binding him, took a big step forward, and tackled Yanzi to the ground.
1:10:15|1:10:21|While the couple [Chen Jiaqiao] and [Yanzi] were fighting, [COCO] hurriedly knocked on the door for help, but no one answered.
1:10:21|1:10:30|At this moment, [Yanzi] has taken out a stun gun from her bag and Chen Jiaqiao desperately dodges, preventing the weapon from hitting her.
1:10:30|1:10:34|Just as the two were struggling, the stun gun was thrown to the wall below [COCO].
1:10:34|1:10:40|At this moment, [COCO] was at a loss, watching as [Chen Jiaqiao] rode onto [Yanzi] and tightly gripped her neck with both hands.
1:10:40|1:10:43|It's obvious that Chen Jiaqiao is determined this time.
1:10:43|1:10:46|Not long after, [Yanzi] had much less strength to struggle.
1:10:47|1:10:54|In the end, [COCO] picked up the electric motor at his feet and pressed it directly against [Chen Jiaqiao]'s neck, allowing [Yanzi] to break free.
1:10:54|1:11:2|[Chen Jiaqiao] was once again tied to a wheelchair, but this time, unlike before, not only his arms, but his whole body was wrapped in ropes.
1:11:2|1:11:12|COCO nervously raises the electric drill and aims it at Yanzi's face.
1:11:12|1:11:14|[Yanzi] approached fearlessly, smiling as she took a few steps forward.
1:11:17|1:11:26|Looking at the girl in front of her with a determined look of returning at all costs, [Yanzi] shook her head helplessly.
1:11:44|1:11:48|[Yanzi] appears calm on the surface, but her eyes are filled with stubbornness and madness.
1:11:48|1:11:53|[COCO] was stunned by this sharp gaze and couldn't move for a moment.
1:11:53|1:11:59|[Yanzi] smiled slightly at the scene, calmly took the electric shaver from her hand, and gently ran it over her hair ends.
1:11:59|1:12:8|[COCO] desperately pounded on the door and called out, but still received no response.
1:12:14|1:12:19|[COCO], who gave up struggling, slumped against the door with lifeless eyes.
1:12:19|1:12:25|At this moment, [Yanzi] pushed a medical cart over, equipped with surgical instruments, medical gloves, and everything needed for the operation.
1:12:25|1:12:31|The medical tools emitted a chilling metallic sheen, causing [COCO] to involuntarily shrink back.
1:12:31|1:12:36|[Yanzi] paid no attention to [COCO]'s little movements, and gently squatted down in front of her.
1:12:49|1:12:55|At this moment, as the movie theater just started, [Chen Jiaqiao] took out her phone to check the messages.
1:13:29|1:13:35|After dealing with the company's affairs, [Yanzi] sat in Chen Jiaqiao's office chair, waiting for the secretary to tidy up the documents.
1:13:40|1:13:44|[Yanzi] stared coldly at the cabinet in the distance without moving a muscle.
1:13:44|1:13:50|At the same time, [Zhang Qing] arrived at the Hekeying State 5201 as mentioned by [COCO] with her police boyfriend.
1:13:50|1:13:59|After receiving a signal from her boyfriend, [Zhang Qing] softly approached and knocked on the door.
1:13:59|1:14:3|When [Chen Jiaqiao] knocked on the door, her boyfriend also felt something was wrong and looked around suspiciously.
1:14:7|1:14:18|At this moment, [COCO] was tied up and thrown into the nursery. Upon hearing his friend's call, he quickly got up and ran towards the door.
1:14:18|1:14:28|[Yanzi] obviously anticipated this, as she had already locked the door to the nursery, while [Chen Jiaqiao] in the living room was tightly bound to a wheelchair, unable to move, with his mouth taped shut, unable to make a sound.
1:14:28|1:14:33|Suddenly, Chen Jiaqiao's police boyfriend took two steps forward and looked thoughtfully at the three locks on the door of the room.
1:14:58|1:15:6|Faced with [Yanzi]'s questioning, [Chen Jiaqiao] pursed his lips, lowered his head, and remained silent, which completely annoyed [Yanzi].
1:15:6|1:15:14|[Yanzi] turned her head and stared straight at [Chen Jiaqiao], who still had a slight look of timidity on his face, but remained silent with pursed lips.
1:15:30|1:15:36|Upon hearing these words, a crack finally appeared on the fearless face of [Chen Jiaqiao], immediately noticed by [Yanzi].
1:15:46|1:15:52|The safe door was popped open, and [Yanzi] reached in and pulled out only an envelope.
1:15:52|1:16:1|[Yanzi] poured out the contents of the envelope in front of the three people, her eyes widening involuntarily, while [Chen Jiaqiao] rested his head on his hands, clearly not wanting to face it.
1:16:1|1:16:8|In the thick stack of photos, [Yanzi] spread them out and found that they were all pictures of [Chen Jiaqiao] with different women.
1:16:9|1:16:15|In the photo, some are kissing, some are hugging, directly showing the intimate relationship between [Chen Jiaqiao] and [Yanzi].
1:16:15|1:16:19|Some of the photos even had a string of text written on the back.
1:16:19|1:16:22|[Yanzi] flipped through the pages and pulled out one to read aloud.
1:16:48|1:16:57|[Chen Jiaqiao] clasped his hands together and closed his eyes tightly, while [Yanzi] glanced at him and then picked up a photo, flipping it over to read aloud from the back.
1:17:10|1:17:18|The girl in the photo is very young, with her hands around [Chen Jiaqiao]'s neck, her bright face filled with a beautiful smile.
1:17:18|1:17:24|[Yanzi] tearfully puts down the photo in her hand, then picks up the next one in a self-torturing manner.
1:17:54|1:17:59|[Chen Jiaqiao] calmly opens his eyes, leaning forward as if seeking the right answer.
1:17:59|1:18:9|Facing the intense gaze from [Yanzi], [Chen Jiaqiao] showed no fear, even managing to smile back at her. He then tried to adjust to a more comfortable position.
1:18:44|1:18:54|At this moment, [COCO] finally realized that the joyful nest in her heart was nothing but a gilded cage in the eyes of [Chen Jiaqiao].
1:18:54|1:18:57|He gave Chen Jiaqiao a disdainful look and got up to leave the living room.
1:18:58|1:19:8|[Yanzi] finally couldn't contain the anger in her heart. As [COCO] rushed into the bedroom, she took three or four steps to [Chen Jiaqiao] and slapped him hard.
1:19:8|1:19:14|Jiaqiao had anticipated this, he looked like a naughty child, opening his mouth wide and staring at [Yanzi] with an innocent expression.
1:19:19|1:19:24|The table full of photos scattered, silently accusing Chen Jiaqiao's misdeeds.
1:19:24|1:19:25|Epilogue, liberation.
1:19:25|1:19:37|The kitchen belongs to [Yanzi], where the green shrimp is poured into the oil pan and visibly changes color, tomatoes are sliced thinly, radishes are neatly lined up, and the soup made from fish balls is fresh and translucent.
1:19:38|1:19:56|The oil in the pot kept rolling, the color of the food was mouth-watering. The zucchini was shredded to remove the soft core in the middle, and the bitter melon was sliced with precision, each slice of consistent thickness. Soon, more than a dozen dishes were brought to the table. Chen Jiaqiao sat in the middle and unceremoniously picked up the braised prawns.
1:20:0|1:20:9|Chen Jiaqiao shook his head and ate a few mouthfuls of rice, then picked up the soup bowl and drank it until the bowl was empty, as Yanzi said from the right side.
1:20:13|1:20:29|Finally, he picked up the shrimp from the pot on the left, eating and spitting out the shells.
1:20:41|1:20:45|Jiaqiao impartially also served a bowl of vegetables to [Yanzi] on the left.
1:21:18|1:21:22|He frowned and drank up the wine in one gulp.
1:21:22|1:21:31|Two women sit facing each other on either side, always bowing their heads in silence.
1:21:36|1:21:41|Chen Jiaqiao stared at the food on the table for a long time, then slapped his thigh and got up to leave.
1:21:41|1:21:47|[Yanzi] didn't raise her head slightly to look at the dim light until Chen Jiaqiao left.
1:21:47|1:21:51|Chen Jiaqiao came to the bathroom and stood in front of the mirror, revealing a perfect smile.
1:21:51|1:21:56|She moved closer, carefully illuminating her own face.
1:21:56|1:22:1|In [Yanzi]'s silent recipe, her eyebrows are almost gone.
1:22:1|1:22:4|Chen Jiaqiao took a deep breath and picked up an eyebrow pencil to draw her eyebrows.
1:22:5|1:22:12|He furrowed his brow for a long time, until he was satisfied with the left side, then switched the pen to his right hand and started drawing the right eyebrow.
1:22:12|1:22:19|Outlining eyebrows is not an easy task. Before long, Chen Jiaqiao became a bit irritable, even her breathing became heavier.
1:22:19|1:22:26|Finally, after drawing the eyebrow shape to her satisfaction, [Chen Jiaqiao] raised the corners of her mouth, took a picture with her eyebrows in a smooth arc, and then put down the eyebrow pencil.
1:22:26|1:22:38|However, in the next scene, something unbelievable unfolds. Chen Jiaqiao picks up another cosmetic product and firmly presses the foundation onto the powder puff, then skillfully pats it onto his own face.
1:22:38|1:22:44|At this moment, the two women in the restaurant still had no idea what had happened, and they remained silent, looking at each other.
1:22:44|1:22:47|[Chen Jiaqiao] stared at his reflection in the mirror, smiling in a very eerie way.
1:22:47|1:22:55|He lit up the dressing table again, finally picking up a lipstick. She hesitated and twisted it out, aiming at her lips in the mirror.
1:22:55|1:23:0|With each vigorous stroke of lipstick, [Chen Jiaqiao]'s mouth instantly became a vibrant canvas.
1:23:4|1:23:13|After all this was done, [Chen Jiaqiao] sighed, looking at the mirror. The person in the mirror had broad eyebrows, bright eyes, and fair complexion. It was herself, yet not herself.
1:23:13|1:23:21|[Chen Jiaqiao] slowly approached the mirror and left a lip print on it, perhaps this was the last thing he wanted to leave in this world.
1:23:23|1:23:32|Finally, after opening the mirror, Chen Jiaqiao took out all five bottles of vitamin C from the storage cabinet, and then remembered to close the cabinet door.
1:23:32|1:23:41|[Chen Jiaqiao] sits by the bathtub, neatly lining up the medications. As he fills the bathtub with water, he pours vitamin C into his palm and takes it to his mouth.
1:23:42|1:23:47|Continuing, she directly opened the medicine bottle and poured it into her mouth, as if chewing candy beans.
1:23:47|1:23:56|[Yanzi] finally reacted first. She slowly raised her head and looked towards the bathroom. Suddenly her face changed, while [COCO] was still leaning on the table immersed in sadness.
1:23:58|1:24:2|The water in the bathtub kept overflowing, flowing down the steps.
1:24:2|1:24:7|Next to the bathtub, there are pills scattered all over, and the medicine bottle is about to fall under the impact of the water flow.
1:24:7|1:24:15|When [Yanzi] opened the door, the scene she saw was [Chen Jiaqiao] fully clothed lying in the bathtub, with his whole body already submerged in water.
1:24:15|1:24:19|Her expression was unprecedentedly calm, obviously already devoid of breath.
1:24:20|1:24:25|[Yanzi] was momentarily unable to accept everything in front of her, relying solely on instinct to move forward.
1:24:25|1:24:35|Upon hearing the noise, [COCO] came over and saw the scene, taking a few steps back to lean against the door frame. She didn't know how to calm herself down, so she could only breathe heavily.
1:24:35|1:24:41|Until standing at the edge of the bathtub, [Yanzi]'s expression finally changed, she lay down on the ground, staring straight at the water surface.
1:24:42|1:24:50|[Chen Jiaqiao], a man who is hailed as a successful gentleman in society, ultimately pays the price for his insatiable greed.
1:24:50|1:25:1|At the dining table, the shrimp and high doses of vitamin C can produce trimethylamine and P cream, leading to death. [Chen Jiaqiao] is determined to completely free himself, even if it means drowning in the water tank.
1:25:1|1:25:4|Is it self-liberation or escaping from everything, no one can say for sure.
1:25:5|1:25:20|Early the next morning, [Chen Jiaqiao] sat in a wheelchair, pushed out by [Yanzi]. She was dressed in a sharp pinstripe suit with a colorful tie, her tightly closed eyes and bruised face silently reminding everyone that she had left this world.
1:25:21|1:25:27|[COCO] wearily sat up and was almost scared out of her wits when she saw this scene.
1:25:27|1:25:35|While [Yanzi] disagreed, she was wearing a clean white shirt, with her hair neatly arranged, pushing the wheelchair to the window.
1:25:35|1:25:42|[Yanzi] squatted down, carefully adjusting [Chen Jiaqiao]'s tie, then straightened her collar, affectionately stroking her chin.
1:25:47|1:25:52|[COCO] saw this scene and was so scared that she didn't even dare to breathe, trembling all over.
1:25:52|1:25:59|Yanzi carefully picked up the already prepared porridge again, stirring it attentively, afraid of scalding the person in front of her.
1:26:10|1:26:15|No matter how deep [Yanzi]'s affection is, [Chen Jiaqiao] in front of her gives her no response.
1:26:15|1:26:20|[Yanzi] was indifferent to this, still spooning porridge into [Chen Jiaqiao]'s mouth.
1:26:20|1:26:26|The body that has lost its physiological functions naturally cannot swallow, and the porridge slowly flows from the corner of [Chen Jiaqiao]'s mouth.
1:26:26|1:26:31|[Yanzi] gently wipes with a handkerchief, as if taking care of a child.
1:26:31|1:26:33|Later, she pushed [Chen Jiaqiao] to the balcony.
1:26:52|1:26:57|[Yanzi] turned the wheelchair towards the outside, enjoying the familiar scenery together with Chen Jiaqiao.
1:26:57|1:27:2|The scene shows a bustling city with tall buildings as far as the eye can see.
1:27:2|1:27:7|The cross-river cable car is like a small square box, sliding down the cableway all the way, disappearing among the buildings.
1:27:8|1:27:14|The river is filled with boats of all sizes, with everyone busy and bustling for their livelihood.
1:27:14|1:27:22|Suddenly, [COCO] looked towards the door, only to see a group of police officers rushing into the house with guns, led by Zhang Qing, her boyfriend.
1:27:22|1:27:29|The police carefully searched every corner of the house until they saw [COCO] was safe and sound, then they finally relaxed.
1:27:29|1:27:37|At this moment, [COCO] had no strength to speak and silently looked towards the balcony. Following this clue, the police successfully found [Yanzi] and [Chen Jiaqiao].
1:27:38|1:27:47|At this moment, [Yanzi] quietly looked at the beautiful scenery below the balcony. Even when she sensed the police approaching, she showed no signs of panic, as if she had anticipated everything.
1:28:9|1:28:15|The expensive jewelry in the Jinjian store emits a dazzling light, but all of this cannot overshadow the brilliant smile of [Yanzi].
1:28:15|1:28:24|They crossed the bridge over the river and arrived at a rooftop. [Chen Jiaqiao] bent down and held Princess [Yanzi] in his arms.
1:28:32|1:28:36|Upon hearing these words, [Chen Jiaqiao] set [Yanzi] down and wrapped his arms around her waist.
1:28:50|1:28:57|After a heartfelt vow, [Chen Jiaqiao] kissed [Yanzi], who held him tightly around the neck, responding passionately.
1:28:57|1:29:6|Perhaps only at this moment, [Chen Jiaqiao] is sincere. Everyone talks about the seven-year itch, but [Chen Jiaqiao] has been completely disloyal in these six years.
1:29:6|1:29:13|[Yanzi] disguised herself as Gu Xiaofan, and the reason for getting close to the stingy seems to have an explanation, with a large amount of news about Gu Xiaofan's marital status being exposed.
1:29:14|1:29:21|Chen Jiaqiao's husband had a secret meeting with a mysterious woman at a nightclub, and Chen Jiaqiao's phone was turned off, refusing interviews.
1:29:21|1:29:26|Subsequently, Chen Jiaqiao's husband was found dead on the street, suspected of being poisoned, and the police intervened in the investigation.
1:29:26|1:29:30|Later on, Gu Xiaofan fell from the building, and the police determined it as a suicide.
1:29:30|1:29:38|The last piece of news is the suicide note left by Gu Xiaofan, with only one sentence: "I am utterly disappointed in marriage."
1:29:38|1:29:43|The unbearable marriage crushed this successful woman, even causing her fans to imitate the same.
1:29:53|1:29:58|[COCO] is walking along the riverbank, pushing a baby stroller, wearing a floral dress.
1:29:58|1:30:9|[Chen Jiaqiao], as a participant, let go due to helplessness towards love and self-feelings, leaving life to continue, allowing the originally closed three-person relationship to ripple in the passage of time.
1:30:10|1:30:20|But in fact, the most desperate thing in life is not ending life, not running out of time, but that life is far from over, and you have no possibility at all.
