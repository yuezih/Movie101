0:0:46|0:0:50|That day, Prince Bei was rushing to the Divine Mechanism Camp in great haste.
0:0:59|0:1:5|Prince Bei, trusted by Empress Dowager Cixi, wielded great power at the time. He promoted the construction of railways and factories, as well as the establishment of a modernized army.
0:1:27|0:1:33|Prince Bei hurriedly ran in the palace, followed by four maids holding the Six Harmonies Unified Hat.
0:1:35|0:1:41|Following closely behind. Just as they turned the corner, a large, peculiar-looking mechanical aircraft flew past the prince's head.
0:1:41|0:1:50|The flying machine passed by, with an extremely domineering presence. Its mortise and tenon structure seamlessly integrated with steel bars, but the most eye-catching feature was its flamboyant wings that resembled a phoenix.
0:2:3|0:2:11|Prince Bei looked at the imposing aura of the sky like a dominant force, with a slight smile on his lips, filling his heart with confidence.
0:2:11|0:2:17|He stopped his hurried pace and carefully observed the majestic wings soaring freely above the Forbidden City.
0:2:26|0:2:36|Outside the village of [Chenjia Gou], in the distance, on the war machine Troy that had already been destroyed, there lay a groom in a silk jacket and a six-harmony hat.
0:2:36|0:2:42|Alone lying on the ruins on this joyous day, this person is not simple.
0:3:55|0:4:2|Yang Luchan, who fell from the ruins, rushed to the hall non-stop to attend the wedding with Chen Yuniang.
0:4:2|0:4:14|On the left and right of the main hall sat the elders of Chen Family Village, while seated at the top of the hall were Chen Yuniang's father Chen Changxing and the highly respected San Shuzu. However, at this solemn wedding ceremony, Yang Luchan, who was naturally a bit foolish, looked around in confusion.
0:4:15|0:4:22|Even with the reminder from the disciples of the [Chen Family], he remembered to kneel before the two elders.
0:4:37|0:4:46|The distant shout shattered the original peace, and everyone looked over to see two figures outside the door, wearing masks and straw hats, slowly walking towards the hall.
0:4:46|0:4:56|Halfway through, the man suddenly flung his bamboo hat back into the hall. In the instant the hat left the man's hand, it spun at high speed like a flying knife, as if it could cut through everything.
0:4:56|0:5:3|As the groomsman [Chen Youzhi] saw the situation, he took the lead and kicked the hat from the roof into the copper bell below.
0:5:4|0:5:10|Chen Youzhi finished speaking and swiftly flew out of the hall, leaping into the air at the steps and arriving in front of the man.
0:5:10|0:5:19|[Chen Youzhi] saw the man who remained unfazed with his head down, so he naturally didn't hold back and threw a punch directly at his face. Strangely, the man seemed to know [Chen's] moves inside out.
0:5:19|0:5:36|Chen Youzhi had not yet made his next move when he used his right foot as a pivot to lean back and avoid the attack. He then blocked Chen Youzhi's arms with both hands and said,
0:5:36|0:5:42|[Chen Yuniang] heard her elder brother and then tore off the red veil and ran out.
0:5:48|0:6:2|Chen Zaiyang, the eldest son of the Chen family, saw San Shuzu who had come specially. His eyes gradually moistened, and he couldn't care about catching up with his siblings. He walked through the crowd, went straight to San Shuzu, clasped his hands in front of him, bowed deeply, and paid his respects.
0:6:5|0:6:11|After bowing to [San Shuzu], [Chen Zaiyang] slowly shifted his gaze to his father, who was still sitting grim-faced at the head of the hall.
0:6:11|0:6:20|The elders in the hall were all discussing when they saw Chen Zaiyang, but Chen Changxing, upon seeing his long-lost eldest son, showed no signs of joy or reunion, instead maintaining a stern expression.
0:6:20|0:6:28|[Chen Zaiyang] had a thousand words to say, but now, seeing his stern father, he didn't know where to start. After staring at each other for a long time,
0:6:28|0:6:37|[Chen Changxing] turned and walked towards the room. Faced with this situation, [Chen Zaiyang] obviously did not expect it, standing still in confusion. At this moment, outside the door, [Brother Tofu] shouted,
0:6:46|0:6:58|Just after the little incident, the groom [Yang Luchan] has already finished off the roast chicken on the table. At night, the Chen family's valley was brightly lit, with fireworks going off, as lively as the New Year.
0:6:58|0:7:7|At the banquet, [San Shuzu] warmly entertained everyone.
0:7:46|0:7:55|It seems that [Chen Zaiyang] and his wife noticed each other's unusual behavior, while on the rooftop, [Chen Changxing] and [Chen Yuniang] were watching [Yang Luchan] inside the house.
0:8:44|0:8:52|Chen Changxing sighed as he looked at his strong-willed daughter, and said very tactfully,
0:9:51|0:10:3|[Chen Changxing] finished speaking, then gracefully leaped down from the high eaves like walking on water. Following that, [Chen Yuniang] entered the room, snatched the leaves from [Yang Luchan]'s hand, and tapped his head, but [Yang Luchan] just laughed out loud.
0:10:14|0:10:20|[Yang Luchan], although looking puzzled, obediently knelt in front of [Chen Yuniang], who then established the family rules.
0:11:7|0:11:16|Just as [Chen Zaiyang] was pondering with his head down, he suddenly sensed movement outside the door. Before [Chen Zaiyang] could even get up, [Jin Yuner] had already silently arrived at the window like a ghost.
0:11:32|0:11:42|After seeing that there was no danger, he slowly closed the window. But at that moment, a dark figure flashed outside. Seeing this figure, [Jin Yuner] immediately hid behind the door pillar and drew the Indian soft sword hidden in his sleeve.
0:11:46|0:11:57|Upon hearing it was [Chen Youzhi], [Chen Zaiyang] lightly patted [Jin Yuner]'s shoulder to signal her to stay calm, then opened the door.
0:12:9|0:12:16|Upon [Chen Youzhi]'s late-night visit, [Chen Zaiyang], after much contemplation, decided to explain the reasons to him.
0:12:43|0:12:52|The tenth ancestor [Chen Suole], although old with gray hair, effortlessly sent the young and strong Zhou Bin of the Tiger Claw Sect flying several meters away.
0:13:48|0:13:58|The crazy monk, with his qi gathered in his dantian, stood in front of the door, a scar on his head emitting a golden light. His Buddha energy surrounded him like a golden bell, and with just this move, he severely injured several disciples of the Chen family.
0:15:55|0:16:3|[Chen Zaiyang] remained silent after hearing this, his serious expression making [Chen Youzhi] nervous.
0:16:58|0:17:5|[Chen Zaiyang] looked at the eager [Yang Luchan] who was seeking martial arts guidance, and said as if he had a plan,
0:17:12|0:17:22|[Chen Zaiyang] is seen performing large and exaggerated movements, standing on one leg with his body almost parallel to the ground.
0:17:24|0:17:30|After speaking, [Chen Zaiyang] continued to demonstrate, his two legs standing on the ground like wooden stakes.
0:17:31|0:17:38|Above the knees, he swayed like a dragon. After the demonstration, [Yang Luchan] exclaimed in admiration,
0:18:2|0:18:10|At this moment, [Chen Zaiyang] slowly walked up to [Yang Luchan], but instead of helping him, he just picked up [Yang Luchan]'s hat and put it back on his head.
0:18:12|0:18:14|Later, [Chen Zaiyang] turned away contemptuously and left.
0:18:14|0:18:24|At this moment, [Yang Luchan], with his arms captured and kneeling on one knee, had a fierce look in his eyes, filled with anger.
0:18:25|0:18:34|In the hall, [Chen Ersao] is showing [Jin Yuner] around the Chen family disciples practicing boxing. [Jin Yuner] gestures and asks [Chen Ersao] why she doesn't learn boxing.
0:18:40|0:18:47|Looking up at the bronze bell above the hall again, [Chen Ersao] saw it and explained,
0:19:3|0:19:13|In the narrow path of Chen Family Valley, [Yang Luchan] broke through a thick stone wall in pursuit of the three who had just captured him. Although [Chen Youzhi] managed to avoid [Yang Luchan]'s attacks, the momentum of [Yang Luchan] continued to shake him.
0:19:13|0:19:19|At the same time, [Jin Yuner] in the hall, seeing no one around, leaped clean and landed neatly on the bronze bell.
0:19:19|0:19:25|In the alley, [Chen Youzhi] was so intimidated by [Yang Luchan]'s momentum that he lost all his fighting spirit and turned to run.
0:19:25|0:19:35|Back in the hall, just as the bronze bell was still swaying, a figure with hands behind slowly walked out from the room. Meanwhile in the village, Yang Luchan didn't catch up with Chen Youzhi, but managed to catch Brother Tofu.
0:19:36|0:19:46|After a brief exchange, Yang Luchan kicked Brother Tofu to the ground, but instead of finishing him off, Yang Luchan let out a roar and chased after the mahjong sister ahead.
0:19:46|0:19:53|[Yang Luchan] was arrogant and unreasonable all the way, causing chaos wherever he went, and finally found the fleeing Mahjong Sister in the market.
0:19:53|0:20:6|Seeing the situation, [Ma Jiangjie] quickly picked up a wine jar from the side and used internal force to smash towards [Yang Luchan]. However, all of this couldn't stop [Yang Luchan]'s steps. Just as [Yang Luchan] was about to punch [Ma Jiangjie], a villager with a wooden stick in hand viciously struck him from behind.
0:20:8|0:20:15|The strike did not take down Yang Luchan, instead putting himself in danger. Yang Luchan lifted the villagers high, glaring angrily at the surrounding crowd.
0:20:17|0:20:25|Just as [Yang Luchan] was about to lose his mind and throw the villagers down heavily, a dazzling light shone into his eyes.
0:20:25|0:20:38|Just at that moment, the Three Flowers on Top malfunctioned, and [Yang Luchan] slowly closed his eyes. His nostrils still sprayed two streams of blood as before, and then he fainted on the ground. The villagers in his hands were lucky to escape unharmed.
0:20:39|0:20:45|On the other side, in a bustling street outside the north gate of Tianjin, many workers were moving goods of all sizes.
0:20:45|0:20:52|The coming and going merchants were endless, of course, there were also soldiers patrolling in line. On this outer street, a tall building stood out prominently.
0:20:52|0:20:58|Although sealed off, it is by no means a place to come and go casually based solely on its momentum.
0:20:58|0:21:5|At this moment, a man in front of the gate blatantly ignored the law, tore off the seal, then pried open the chain and pushed the door open.
0:21:5|0:21:16|Upon closer inspection, the man is none other than the engineer [Fang Zijing] who led the invasion of Chenjiagou with the Trojan army in the previous installment. With a face full of wounds, [Fang Zijing] turned around only to be shocked by the majestic wings hovering above the factory.
0:21:16|0:21:20|The Tianwei Wing may be broken now, but its momentum still sends shivers down one's spine.
0:21:21|0:21:29|[Fang Zijing] approached slowly, his gaze never leaving Tianwei Yi from the moment he entered the room. He looked at the incredible figure in front of him and muttered to himself,
0:22:2|0:22:7|At this moment, the door was suddenly opened by several foreigners.
0:22:12|0:22:16|Facing the shouting of the soldiers, the leading foreigner did not speak, but calmly walked forward.
0:22:16|0:22:25|At this moment, the captain of the soldiers said to his subordinates,
0:22:39|0:22:45|Seeing someone supporting him, [Fang Zijing] quickly regained his composure from the previous embarrassment, his face filled with pride.
0:22:45|0:22:49|After being taken away by Fei Linming, Fang Zijing said to him on the carriage,
0:23:0|0:23:6|After speaking, he threw the account book to [Fang Zijing].
0:23:33|0:23:41|After saying that, [Fei Linming] showed an incredibly eerie smile to [Fang Zijing].
0:23:41|0:23:46|[Fang Zijing] is now absent-minded, looking at the account book with different quantities of money written on it, feeling very uneasy.
0:23:47|0:23:56|In the pharmacy of Chen Family Valley, several people who were injured by Yang Luchan endured the pain and took medicine, while Yang Luchan, who was unconscious, had his hands tied and handcuffed to the cabinet.
0:23:56|0:24:2|After this outbreak, the three flowers on the top of [Yang Luchan]'s head have deepened in color.
0:24:25|0:24:31|[Chen Zaiyang] widened his eyes in disbelief after hearing it, pondered for a moment, and then slowly said,
0:24:42|0:24:51|After listening to the words of his elder brother [Chen Zaiyang], [Chen Yuniang] also wavered in her heart. She came alone to the top of the hill at the village entrance, gazing at the only path leading into the village.
0:24:51|0:25:6|A few months ago, [Fang Zijing] drove this huge machine to flatten the village. In order to cut ties with [Fang Zijing] for the sake of the village, [Chen Yuniang] still had lingering feelings for him from their childhood. As she thought about it, tears filled her eyes.
0:25:8|0:25:16|[Chen Yuniang], who has always been thinking about love between men and women, is still practicing with [Yang Luchan] in a perfunctory manner. Her martial arts moves are all based on muscle memory, with her mind elsewhere.
0:25:30|0:25:42|[Chen Yuniang] had lost interest in teaching, turned around and left. At this moment, [Chen Changxing] shouted from a distance, and [Yang Luchan] turned around to see the sect leader hanging upside down on a tree, so he hurried over.
0:26:40|0:26:48|[Chen Changxing] listened and suddenly widened his eyes in surprise. After carefully examining [Yang Luchan] for a moment, he glanced at his Three Flower Gathering on Top.
0:26:53|0:27:15|Later, [Chen Changxing] walked away contentedly, leaving [Yang Luchan] behind. Yang did not become conceited after receiving praise, but instead, the alleviation of the backlash from the Three Flowers Gathering at the Top allowed him to use his mind more flexibly and to feel life more delicately. Watching the villagers picking herbs, their movements integrated with the Chen-style boxing, he had a deeper understanding of the Chen-style boxing in an instant.
0:27:15|0:27:25|At the same time, a wall with a foreign atmosphere was built on a barren land on the outskirts of Tianjin, with graves of various sizes arranged inside the courtyard.
0:27:27|0:27:36|The English inscription on a tombstone in one of the cemeteries reads: "This is my lifelong love," and the signature below the sorrowful words is [Fang Zijing], who blew himself up with his girlfriend Troy.
0:27:36|0:27:41|[Fang Zijing] leaned against the tombstone, with empty and lifeless eyes.
0:27:41|0:27:46|Whenever he thinks of Claire, he comes to this place, and stays here for several hours.
0:27:46|0:27:51|At this moment, Fang Zijing saw Duke Fei Linming approaching him from the corner of his eye, and said,
0:29:2|0:29:20|Fei Linming still looked back at Fang Zijing disdainfully, but when he saw the determined and ambitious look in Fang Zijing's eyes, his expression gradually became serious. At night, only a few households in Chen Family Gully still had lights on. Yang Luchan stood on the roof, diligently practicing as usual.
0:29:20|0:29:27|[Yang Luchan] practiced boxing while gaining insights, as if entering a state of forgetfulness. By the window, [Chen Yuniang], still pondering about love and family, suddenly heard movement outside the door.
0:29:27|0:29:35|[Chen Yuniang] rushed out of the house without hesitation to find out what was going on. She looked in the direction of the sound and saw [Chen Changxing] sitting on a chair outside the door.
0:29:41|0:29:46|[Chen Changxing] said nothing, but instead intricately carved and opened the elaborate wooden mechanism in his hand.
0:30:2|0:30:9|[Chen Yuniang] hadn't finished speaking when the sound of a bronze bell came from the village. Sitting beside her, [Chen Changxing] calmly said,
0:30:12|0:30:19|The next day arrived in the blink of an eye, with sudden changes in the weather and the sky darkening.
0:30:19|0:30:27|As soon as the day broke, the villagers rushed to the hall, with Yang Luchan following closely behind Chen Yuniang.
0:30:28|0:30:39|When the two entered the hall, they were shocked and speechless by the scene before them. They saw a massive bronze bell, weighing thousands of kilograms, spinning rapidly as if driven by some unknown divine force.
0:30:39|0:30:46|The early arrival of several senior elders saw the situation and knelt down to kowtow under the bronze bell, as if praying for the forgiveness of the gods.
0:31:13|0:31:21|Facing the malicious words from the people of [Chen Village], [Yang Luchan] was unable to argue back, while his wife [Chen Yuniang] wanted to silence them with her actions.
0:31:22|0:31:33|[Chen Yuniang] was about to step forward to stop the bronze bell, but her shoulder was held down by a hand. Before she could react, [Chen Zaiyang] leaped up and landed in front of the bronze bell. The bronze bell was originally as heavy as a thousand catties and could not be moved.
0:31:33|0:31:42|The increased rotational force of the high-speed spinning is now difficult to estimate. Faced with this awe-inspiring behemoth, [Chen Zaiyang] remains incredibly calm, as he channels his energy to his dantian and delivers a palm strike.
0:31:59|0:32:5|Chen Zaiyang finished demonstrating the most basic techniques of the Chen family fist around him, returned to his original position, and gathered his energy again.
0:32:11|0:32:22|Chen Zaiyang seized the opportunity, gathered all his strength into his palms, and struck the bronze bell. The bell, weighing thousands of pounds, rolled in the air for two rounds before landing steadily. After dealing with the bronze bell,
0:32:22|0:32:30|[Chen Zaiyang] turned around with a hint of pride, standing in front of everyone. After witnessing it with their own eyes, everyone present was impressed by [Chen Zaiyang]'s skill.
0:32:31|0:32:40|And besides what everyone saw on the scene, this scene was also closely observed by Jin Yuner hidden on the rooftop.
0:32:40|0:32:52|At this moment, a figure quietly flew from the other end of the roof. [Jin Yuner], under the sunlight, was indistinguishable as friend or foe, so she quickly drew her sword. But as soon as the sword was drawn, she was kicked away. [Jin Yuner] immediately regained her composure and stabbed towards the man with her flexible sword, which was soft and hard at the same time.
0:32:52|0:33:0|Unpredictable and elusive, his swordsmanship is truly hard to grasp. The man who was almost injured leaped into the air and then stood on the eaves, slowly turning around.
0:33:11|0:33:22|[Jin Yuner] saw [Chen Changxing], she truthfully confessed: at that time, she was hidden inside the bronze bell, fixed the base of the instrument on the top of the bronze bell, just gently swayed, and the three iron balls hanging on the instrument would spin rapidly.
0:33:22|0:33:29|After finishing her instructions, [Jin Yuner] flew off the eaves. At this moment, inside the hall, [San Shuzu] announced,
0:33:50|0:33:59|[Chen Zaiyang] seemed to be playing with his little sister on the side, but in fact, he listened attentively to every word everyone said. He turned slowly, with a look of melancholy on his face, and walked up to [San Shuzu].
0:34:8|0:34:15|After [Chen Zaiyang] politely declined, he never expected that no one would persuade him again. Seeing this situation, he could only say again,
0:34:40|0:34:51|As soon as the words fell, [Chen Changxing], who had been observing for a long time, stepped on the roof and fell into the house. Upon seeing his father's sudden arrival, [Chen Zaiyang] became nervous.
0:35:12|0:35:22|Seeing [Chen Zaiyang] remaining silent, [Chen Changxing] took out a letter from his sleeve and stood it in front of him.
0:36:11|0:36:23|[Yang Luchan] looked nervously at [Chen Yuniang], while on the other side, [Chen Zaiyang] was pressured by [San Shuzu]. Under the heavy pressure, [Chen Zaiyang], seeing the confident [San Shuzu] beside him, reluctantly moved forward.
0:36:23|0:36:33|Standing opposite, [Yang Luchan] could only grit his teeth and walk to the front. At this moment, the two stood in front of the hall in full view of everyone, but their desire to fight was not high. On the side, [Chen Changxing] watched.
0:36:33|0:36:37|Reluctant to make a move, [Yang Luchan] was then instructed by words.
0:36:39|0:36:55|[Yang Luchan] followed orders and assumed a stance, with a stable lower body, left arm straight, left hand in a hook shape, and right palm blocking in front. As this move was executed, the momentum was completely different from before. [Chen Changxing] saw [Chen Zaiyang] starting his move and continued to say,
0:36:56|0:37:8|As soon as the two started, they found that [Chen Zaiyang]'s previous skills were full of loopholes. At this moment, [Yang Luchan] lifted his right foot in front of [Chen Zaiyang] without exerting force, and [Chen Changxing] realized that [Yang Luchan] was intentionally holding back.
0:37:10|0:37:15|The force of the paper ball pushed [Chen Zaiyang] back several meters, at this moment, [Chen Zaiyang] did not have the same strength as when he struck the bell.
0:37:20|0:37:27|Upon hearing Chen Yuniang's confusion, Chen Changxing did not explain. Chen Zaiyang's punches were all deflected, and his body gradually stiffened, unable to fight back.
0:37:27|0:37:30|At this moment, [Yang Luchan] executed a high probing horse move, throwing [Chen Zaiyang] into the air.
0:37:31|0:37:39|After the reversal, seizing the opportunity, he crowned it with all his strength to deliver the final double push hands. Struck by this move, [Chen Zaiyang] was sent flying into the air.
0:37:39|0:37:45|The robe was also shattered by the internal strength of [Yang Luchan]. But at this moment, to everyone's surprise, they found that besides the robe being shattered,
0:37:45|0:37:54|Flying out with it were many mechanical parts. Everyone present, except for [Chen Changxing], hung their heads in sigh, all deeply moved by the scene.
0:37:54|0:38:21|Originally, the profound skills displayed by [Chen Zaiyang] were all enhanced by the machine he developed. His solid foundation was achieved by inserting nails into the ground through his shoes. The reason that triggered [Yang Luchan]'s outburst was not because he couldn't bear the humiliation, but because when [Chen Zaiyang] put a hat on him, he inserted a silver needle into his corner. As a father, [Chen Changxing] looked at the sky full of parts and gears still spinning, falling into memories of Zaiyang's childhood.
0:38:21|0:38:27|One afternoon many years ago, [Chen Changxing] happily accompanied [Chen Yuniang] as they swung on a swing.
0:38:28|0:38:34|At this moment, [Chen Zaiyang] ran up to his father with his younger brothers and said,
0:38:36|0:38:44|Shortly after, [Chen Changxing] sat up with a smile on his face, eagerly awaiting [Chen Zaiyang]'s boxing technique. His younger brothers and sisters also sat on the side, ready to learn.
0:38:44|0:38:53|[Chen Zaiyang], after preparing, turned to face [Chen Changxing], performing the Diamond Pounder followed by the Cross Hands, a set of movements flowing smoothly and with great momentum.
0:38:53|0:39:1|[Chen Changxing] watched as [Chen Zaiyang] made rapid progress, nodding in approval. His younger siblings were even more fascinated, admiring him endlessly.
0:39:1|0:39:6|After seeing everyone's satisfied expressions, [Chen Zaiyang] leaped high into the air, followed by a move resembling a white crane spreading its wings, pushing the atmosphere to a climax.
0:39:9|0:39:17|At this moment, [Chen Changxing] had already put away his smile, and instead looked at [Chen Zaiyang] with a serious expression, as if he was gradually discovering clues from Chen Zaiyang's movements.
0:39:17|0:39:30|At this moment, as [Chen Zaiyang] continued to spin and kick high, he gradually lost control. His movements became stiff, the kicking became mechanical, and his body spun faster and faster. He tried hard to regain control, but faced with the powerful mechanical force, his efforts were in vain.
0:39:32|0:39:43|Chen Changxing quickly followed the direction of rotation and grabbed Chen Zaiyang's right hand, pulling him into his arms. At this moment, the machine also exceeded its load, and countless parts popped out of the clothes, scattering all over the ground.
0:39:43|0:39:51|Chen Changxing was stunned to see the mechanical vest covered with gears on Zaiyang's chest, unable to speak for a long time.
0:39:51|0:40:3|He angrily threw [Chen Zaiyang] on the ground, [Chen Changxing] sighed with disappointment, then turned and walked towards the house. Seeing this, his younger siblings hurried forward to help their older brother. Now, a scene in the hall.
0:40:3|0:40:13|Just like many years ago. [Chen Changxing] had tears in his eyes and sighed, saying,
0:40:14|0:40:20|He finished speaking, without even looking at [Chen Zaiyang], he walked straight towards the door. Seeing this, [Chen Zaiyang] felt even more wronged.
0:40:20|0:40:40|At this moment, [Chen Yuniang] noticed the distress of [Chen Zaiyang] and persuaded him. After hearing this, [Chen Zaiyang] burst into tears, broke free from the support of the crowd, and shouted. Although [Chen Changxing] did not turn around, he slowed down his pace. After wiping away his tears, [Chen Zaiyang] sat on the ground and continued speaking.
0:41:10|0:41:19|San Shuzu, after hearing the truth, hung his head in frustration like iron unable to turn into steel.
0:41:23|0:41:33|The brothers and sisters around him were all very angry after hearing this, but looking at the eldest brother in front of them full of helplessness and grievances, even with all the resentment, they became understandable in the face of family affection.
0:41:33|0:41:43|[Chen Zaiyang] finished speaking, his eyes moist as he glanced at the deceived [Yang Luchan], after a long while, a tear of regret rolled down, but he said nothing more, slowly stood up and looked towards [San Shuzu].
0:41:43|0:41:50|San Shuzu looked at Chen Zaiyang, who almost caused a disaster for himself, without any sense of regret, and then turned and walked away.
0:41:52|0:41:59|The elders were like grass on the wall, speaking ill of [Chen Zaiyang], but these harsh words had little effect on the eldest son of the sect leader.
0:41:59|0:42:11|For Chen Zaiyang, who doesn't love practicing martial arts, it seems like he has long been tired of hearing it. Dragging his disheveled body, he dejectedly walks towards the gate, without a moment's pause after changing his outfit.
0:42:11|0:42:16|With his wife [Jin Yuner], [Chen Changxing] left [Chen Village]. At this moment, [Chen Yuniang] and [Yang Luchan] caught up on horseback.
0:42:16|0:42:27|After being called, [Chen Zaiyang] turned around and looked somewhat surprised at the two dismounting figures. [Chen Yuniang] ran up to her elder brother with a embroidered cloth bag in her hands and said,
0:42:28|0:42:34|[Chen Zaiyang] pulled out a wooden box from the cloth bag with a puzzled expression, and exclaimed in surprise after opening it,
0:42:43|0:42:50|Chen Zaiyang suddenly understood after hearing this, that although his father was strict in every way, he still cared for him in his heart at all times.
0:42:52|0:43:1|At this moment, Yang Luchan handed the reins of the horse to his big brother with a reluctant expression, Chen Zaiyang took the reins and looked at the simple and honest young man in front of him, saying,
0:43:3|0:43:11|Just as Chen Zaiyang's tears seemed about to fall, he turned around and left Chenjiagou with his wife on horseback. What Zaiyang didn't know was,
0:43:11|0:43:24|This time, not only [Chen Yuniang] and [Chen Changxing] came to see them off. [Chen Changxing], who had long been hidden on the Trojan, had moist eyes, enduring the pain of separation, watching his son gradually leave. Perhaps this is the strict father's way of expressing love.
0:43:26|0:43:35|On the night when [Chen Zaiyang] and his wife left [Chen Family Valley], [Jiang Yanhao], the governor of Henan Province, played music on a phonograph in his warehouse filled with embezzled goods.
0:43:35|0:43:47|Accompanied by cheerful music, [Jiang Yanhao] proudly looked at the wall full of national treasure-level antique vases. After hesitating for a moment, he picked up his favorite flambe glazed plum vase and examined it carefully. But just then...
0:43:47|0:43:48|Indian cavalry forced their way in,
0:43:48|0:44:1|The sudden sound in the theater startled [Jiang Yanhao], causing the enamel bottle to slip from his hand, but luckily it fell onto his foot and did not break. By the time he reacted, several Indian soldiers with rifles had surrounded him, and [Jiang Yanhao] pretended to
0:44:3|0:44:9|Shouting loudly, but the soldiers showed no fear on their faces after hearing it, still holding their rifles high and aiming at [Jiang Yanhao].
0:44:9|0:44:22|At this moment, an official dressed in a catcher's uniform and wearing a lotus flower on his head slowly picked up the enamel bottle that had fallen to the ground. Because he held the bottle in front of him, [Jiang Yanhao] could not see his face clearly and dared not act rashly. However, he soon realized that the person was none other than [Fang Zijing].
0:44:25|0:44:32|As soon as Jiang Yanhao finished speaking, Fang Zijing smashed the priceless Ruby Red Plum Vase on the ground.
0:45:0|0:45:13|[Fang Zijing] listened without any change in his gloomy face, walked slowly to [Jiang Yanhao]'s front, and looked at the timid [Jiang Yanhao] as he whispered,
0:45:26|0:45:30|Under Fang Zijing's command, the soldiers escorted the corrupt official Jiang Yanhao out.
0:45:30|0:45:40|The room full of gold and silver treasures, antiques and famous paintings did not interest [Fang Zijing] at all. He didn't even spare a glance at them, instead he walked over to the phonograph and started enjoying the music.
0:45:41|0:45:47|Late at night, in Chen Family Valley, Chen Yuniang turned over in the middle of the night only to find that Yang Luchan on the bedroll was already gone.
0:45:47|0:45:59|She knew [Yang Luchan]'s habits well, so she put on her clothes and leaped onto the roof to ask,
0:46:7|0:46:26|The next morning, the market in Tianjin was already filled with vendors. When Jin Yuner saw the patrolling soldiers approaching, she signaled Chen Zaiyang to avoid them. Chen Zaiyang, quick-witted, grabbed Jin Yuner and ran to a steamed bun shop, pretending to be customers. Chen Zaiyang kept an eye on the soldiers as they left and then hurriedly departed.
0:46:28|0:46:38|At this point, the two of them no longer had the leisurely elegance of their previous walk, walking quickly with their heads slightly lowered along the bustling street. When they arrived at their factory, they found that the seal and iron chain on the gate had not been touched.
0:46:45|0:46:49|[Chen Zaiyang] ran forward in three steps and two steps, looking impatiently at the seal, ready to tear it off.
0:46:49|0:46:56|After some persuasion, [Chen Zaiyang] followed [Jin Yuner]'s advice and arrived at the back window of the factory. [Chen Zaiyang] gestured to [Jin Yuner], and then...
0:46:56|0:47:4|He climbed up the boxes stacked by the back window alone, taking just three or four steps to reach the top. Then, [Chen Zaiyang] did not rush to push open the window and enter.
0:47:4|0:47:13|Instead, he cautiously peeked inside through the slits of the blinds to check the situation. After confirming that there was no one in the factory, [Chen Zaiyang] climbed in.
0:47:13|0:47:19|Accidentally, Chen Zaiyang took a tumble, which seemed quite painful for someone who never practiced martial arts.
0:47:19|0:47:33|He endured the pain, slowly opened his eyes, only to find that the former glory of the factory had long disappeared, replaced by the scene of rats everywhere, like a ruin. But when he saw the parts on the ground, he ignored the pain and quickly got up to pick them up.
0:47:33|0:47:41|Watching his hard work being thrown on the ground like scrap metal, Chen Changxing felt a myriad of emotions in his heart, and his eyes gradually became moist.
0:47:41|0:47:53|After a moment, he looked up at the sky, only the framework of the Tianwei Wing remained, although it was broken, it still made Chen Zaiyang feel extremely proud. He fantasized about himself flying freely in the sky, driving the perfect Tianwei Wing, soaring and flying at will.
0:47:53|0:48:2|When he came to his senses, he still stared at Tianweiyi closely. But just as he choked up, the factory door slowly opened. Chen Zaiyang thought it was Jin Yuner and said,
0:48:4|0:48:11|When [Chen Zaiyang] turned around, he found that [Jin Yuner] had already been captured by the ambushed soldiers. Four soldiers surrounded [Jin Yuner] with their blades at her neck.
0:48:11|0:48:20|The two of them, Chen Changxing and Yang Luchan, were brought back to the yamen out of helplessness. But after they knelt in the hall, Fang Zijing, a fourth-ranking official, slowly walked towards the front of the hall.
0:48:20|0:48:30|[Fang Zijing] was dressed in a mandarin square patch robe, with a red tassel hat on his head, sitting in the hall. His imposing manner was even more majestic under the blessing of the turquoise stone at the top of the tassel hat.
0:48:32|0:48:39|[Chen Zaiyang] heard the voice and found it somewhat familiar. He slowly raised his head and looked up, never expecting that it was indeed [Fang Zijing], the Taoist master.
0:48:40|0:48:47|[Chen Zaiyang] sat cross-legged on the ground casually when he saw that it was someone he knew, and then said,
0:48:49|0:48:56|[Fang Zijing]'s words made [Chen Zaiyang] extremely embarrassed, but due to the huge disparity in status now, he had no choice but to kneel down again on the spot.
0:49:15|0:49:22|[Fang Zijing] saw [Chen Zaiyang] pretending to be silent, so he viciously said to his subordinates,
0:50:43|0:50:52|[Chen Zaiyang] tearfully watched [Fang Zijing] walk away, choked up as he confirmed with him once again,
0:51:6|0:51:15|At this moment, in the mountains and forests of Chen Family Valley, [Chen Changxing] and [Yang Luchan] were hanging upside down on a thick tree branch together. After a moment, [Yang Luchan] asked in confusion,
0:51:27|0:51:32|[Yang Luchan] followed suit after hearing it.
0:51:43|0:51:58|[Chen Changxing] lazily yawned and then turned to look at [Yang Luchan], who was breathing deeply and slowly. After just a few rounds, [Yang Luchan] suddenly opened his eyes as if he had an epiphany and said, then recalled the scene of [Chen Yuniang] practicing with a low mood.
0:52:2|0:52:8|[Chen Changxing] listened and finally showed a relieved expression on his face, then came down from the tree branch and was about to leave.
0:52:15|0:52:22|[Chen Changxing] said, then waved his hand and walked out of the woods, leaving only [Yang Luchan] still hanging upside down on a tree, experiencing the state of mind of watching with the heart.
0:52:22|0:52:26|At noon, in the village, [Chen Yuniang] was fetching water from the well, preparing to cook.
0:52:26|0:52:33|[Chen Yuniang] still had a distracted look on her face. Just then, the sound of iron being struck could be heard coming from the village entrance.
0:52:37|0:52:44|Distracted by the sound, Chen Yuniang accidentally knocked over the water bucket she had just fetched. Moments later, many villagers rushed to the village entrance upon hearing the commotion.
0:52:47|0:52:56|Yang Luchan was seen frantically striking inside the damaged Troy, with villagers listening to the deafening sound of each blow and applauding.
0:52:58|0:53:7|[Yang Luchan], although unarmed, still shattered the ironclad Trojan into pieces. At this moment, [Chen Yuniang] rushed over and stood on top of the Trojan.
0:53:7|0:53:23|Watching the crazy-looking fool in front of him, [Yang Luchan] replied and continued to strike.
0:53:23|0:53:29|And at this moment, [Chen Yuniang], upon hearing such sincere words, tears quietly welled up in her eyes.
0:53:29|0:53:38|She neither approved nor stopped, but jumped off Troy and walked slowly towards the village. As [Chen Yuniang] walked further and further, tears gathered more and more in her eyes.
0:53:38|0:53:55|Just as she was about to speak, she stopped in her tracks and called out to [Yang Luchan]. After [Chen Yuniang] finished speaking, a relieved smile appeared on her face. Upon hearing this, [Yang Luchan] also stopped and walked over to [Chen Yuniang], saying,
0:53:59|0:54:10|As soon as the crowd dispersed, a screw in the Trojan suddenly loosened, and then the entire massive steel fortress could no longer withstand the collapse caused by the profound internal force of [Yang Luchan].
0:54:10|0:54:19|Several days later, the Governor of Zhili Province, along with various officials, arrived at an observation platform on the outskirts. At this moment, the three mighty and domineering cannons below the platform were already poised and ready to fire.
0:54:21|0:54:28|Suddenly, a flash of fire appeared on the land thousands of meters away.
0:55:21|0:55:37|The implication in these words was naturally understood by [Fang Zijing], who then took out the prepared ten thousand taels of silver notes from the book and handed them over with both hands. Seeing the silver notes, the governor immediately relaxed and said,
0:56:6|0:56:14|[Fang Zijing] eyes rolled and he immediately had an idea.
0:56:16|0:56:23|On that night, [Chen Zaiyang] suddenly woke up from his sleep, gasping for breath. He turned to his wife who was by his side and said,
0:56:28|0:56:36|Shortly after, he immediately got up, lifted the mattress, and a protruding nail appeared on the bed board. He pulled out the nail, and a millennium huai yam popped out from the mechanism.
0:56:42|0:56:50|Upon finishing speaking, he then pulled the rope tied to the blueprint, slowly unfolding it. [Jin Yuner] saw that the blueprint was intricately drawn with detailed parts of the Heavenly Wing.
0:57:1|0:57:11|Late at night, after a day of practicing martial arts, [Yang Luchan] returned to his room exhausted as usual after taking a shower.
0:57:12|0:57:22|After closing the door, he casually put on his pajamas, without saying a word, and dove into the bed he had been sleeping on for days. As he lay down, he saw Chen Yuniang standing by the window with a heavy heart.
0:57:22|0:57:26|But [Yang Luchan], who didn't understand women, did not offer any comfort, only saying,
0:57:27|0:57:39|[Chen Yuniang] turned around and looked at this somewhat silly but extremely innocent young man. Thinking of how he had fought for her today, she closed the window and said to him,
0:57:42|0:57:49|[Chen Yuniang] finished speaking and walked towards the embroidered bed, but when she turned around, she found [Yang Luchan] at a loss on the floor.
0:57:50|0:57:59|After receiving the instructions again, [Yang Luchan] finally felt relieved and crawled out of bed to lie down. [Chen Yuniang] on the bed had her back to [Yang Luchan], and after a moment, she realized that [Yang Luchan] was not moving.
0:57:59|0:58:9|So she shyly turned around, but when [Chen Yuniang] turned back, all she saw were the feet of [Yang Luchan].
0:58:9|0:58:17|Obviously not understanding the meaning of [Chen Yuniang]'s words, [Yang Luchan] turned around and said,
0:58:19|0:58:25|[Chen Yuniang] took off her hairpin and used it to extinguish the lantern in the room.
0:58:32|0:58:37|Shortly after, [Chen Yuniang] took the initiative to throw herself onto [Yang Luchan], and the two of them began the marital affair that should have happened long ago.
0:58:37|0:58:46|In the next room, [Chen Changxing], who was sound asleep, suddenly opened his eyes wide upon hearing some noise, looking somewhat uncertainly towards the dark room of [Chen Yuniang].
0:58:46|0:58:52|After this night, Chen Yuniang and Yang Luchan became even more spiritually connected through their martial arts practice.
0:59:3|0:59:14|In the days that followed their conversation in the same room, [Chen Yuniang] finally emerged from her feelings for [Fang Zijing] and wholeheartedly gave her love to [Yang Luchan].
0:59:14|0:59:20|[Chen Yuniang] accompanies [Yang Luchan] day and night to practice martial arts, in order to help him better understand the essence of the Chen family boxing.
0:59:23|0:59:31|While observing the two from the shadows, [Chen Changxing] noticed that [Yang Luchan]'s martial arts skills were improving day by day, and the relationship between the couple was getting closer day by day.
0:59:31|0:59:38|He happily placed the record into the phonograph to listen to the music. While under the careful guidance and yin-yang harmonization of [Yang Luchan] by [Chen Yuniang],
0:59:38|0:59:45|His skills have also made great progress, although his boxing skills are not as good as the sect leader [Chen Changxing], he is now invincible in the village.
0:59:45|0:59:57|Just as [Yang Luchan] was still diligently trying to comprehend the essence of Chen Family Boxing, no one expected that the disaster in Chen Family Valley was quietly approaching. One morning, in the deep and secluded gorge leading to Chen Family Valley,
0:59:57|1:0:2|[Fang Zijing] is leading a large army. [Fang Zijing] is dressed in a fourth-rank official uniform, riding on a horse.
1:0:2|1:0:11|His face was dark and his eyes were filled with endless resentment. Behind him followed dozens of fully armed cavalry soldiers from the Divine Machine Camp.
1:0:11|1:0:19|Passing through the cavalry camp, you can see the three tall and majestic, domineering German Krupp cannons. This heavy cannon, weighing as much as a thousand catties.
1:0:19|1:0:23|It took a full effort from 12 people to slowly push it.
1:0:23|1:0:31|An hour later, a large number of troops had already assembled at the entrance of Chen Village, with three heavy cannons lined up in front of the formation. Meanwhile, the villagers of Chen Gou were still.
1:0:31|1:0:40|Still immersed in a deep sleep, completely unaware. After all preparations were completed, the captain of the Divine Machine Battalion asked [Fang Zijing],
1:0:51|1:1:2|Three cannonballs were seen flying out with a loud noise. Due to the high temperature propulsion, the cannonballs drew three parabolic curves in the air before landing accurately in the village. After each round of firing, the cannon operator would make slight adjustments to the cannon.
1:1:2|1:1:6|Reload the cannonballs again to ensure that each bomb hits a different target.
1:1:6|1:1:25|In this way, the villagers of [Chen Family Village] were subjected to indiscriminate bombing, and the once beautiful and peaceful [Chen Family Village] was instantly reduced to ruins, with houses collapsing. Although the villagers were all skilled in the Chen Family Fist, at this moment, they could only flee. As [Chen Yuniang] and her husband evacuated the crowd to escape, they noticed [Chen Changxing] standing on top of a several-meter-high archway.
1:1:33|1:1:42|[Yang Luchan] remained calm after hearing this, instead, he smiled and leaped high, kicking several times on the pillar before standing on the archway. Once [Yang Luchan] stabilized himself,
1:1:42|1:1:48|[Chen Changxing] suddenly realized that the three flowers on top of his head had completely disappeared.
1:1:49|1:1:55|[Chen Changxing] nodded in satisfaction, then looked towards the village being destroyed and asked [Yang Luchan],
1:2:8|1:2:20|At this moment, the captain of the Shenji Camp outside the village looked at the devastated Chen Family Valley and asked,
1:2:28|1:2:42|The once ruined Chen Family Valley is about to be destroyed under the vengeful heart of [Fang Zijing]. The captain of the Divine Machine Camp rode to the village entrance and shouted,
1:2:47|1:3:0|In this moment of extreme danger, [Chen Changxing] and [Yang Luchan] were calmly having breakfast. At this time, [Chen Youzhi] rushed in and said,
1:3:9|1:3:19|After Chen Youzhi left, Chen Changxing remained calm and composed, not rushing to give orders, but leisurely finished the food in his bowl.
1:3:19|1:3:25|Later, he looked at the two of them and slowly said,
1:3:57|1:4:5|After saying that, [Chen Changxing] slammed the table, with such speed and power that his outer garment still maintained its human shape, standing on the table.
1:4:6|1:4:12|The two stood up and walked to their father, bowing with their hands clasped together.
1:4:18|1:4:28|[Chen Changxing] finished speaking, then handed a token shaped like a Bagua mirror to [Yang Luchan]. After exchanging a glance with each other, the two of them, along with [Chen Changxing], walked towards the village entrance.
1:4:28|1:4:35|As the three of them walked out of the house, the previous dining table was shattered by the shells, and the house collapsed under the successive bombardment.
1:4:35|1:4:51|After a moment, the village gate slowly opened, and three people walked side by side like shooting stars. Their calm faces and majestic aura made thousands of enemy soldiers hold their breath and break out in a cold sweat. The three did not stop at all, walking straight towards the front of the army.
1:4:51|1:5:7|[Fang Zijing] saw the three approaching closer and closer, a sense of unease rising within him. He then ordered dozens of soldiers in front of the formation to aim their rifles at the three and slowly advance. Even the cavalry in soft armor beside [Fang Zijing] followed closely behind, intending to block the three a hundred meters away.
1:5:7|1:5:20|After a moment, the three were surrounded by dozens of muskets pointed at their heads. The soldiers, though armed with muskets, did not dare to slack off in the slightest in the face of the three in front of them. They were all fully focused, fingers on the triggers, ready to fire at any moment.
1:5:20|1:5:32|The encirclement seemed too tight for Chen Changxing to see Fang Zijing on horseback, so he gently pushed aside the musket in front of him. However, the soldiers showed no mercy and pressed the musket against his face.
1:6:34|1:6:40|As soon as [Fang Zijing] finished speaking, the three of them rushed out of the encirclement of the musketeers like lightning.
1:6:42|1:6:51|At the moment before the gunfire, the three of them leaped up from the ground, and the cavalry fell down in response. After the husband and wife exchanged a smile and gave instructions to each other, they separated. At this moment, the remaining cavalry soldiers held sharp blades.
1:6:51|1:6:58|With a fierce expression, he charged towards the three of them. Despite their imposing stature, they seemed to have the momentum to conquer all, but their agility was extremely poor.
1:6:58|1:7:4|[Chen Changxing] seized the opportunity, dodging the attack like gliding on the ground, and struck the horse's belly with his fingers, causing the cavalry to fall one after another.
1:7:4|1:7:28|At this moment, the cavalry formation is in chaos, and Yang Luchan and his wife swiftly deal with the remaining cavalry from the edge. Seeing the situation turning bad, Fang Zijing shouts out. The cavalry captain, upon receiving the order, draws his sword and charges towards Chen Changxing. Chen Changxing agilely dodges, then lifts the horse's mouth with one hand, causing the warhorse to raise its front hoof. Seizing the opportunity, he strikes the horse's belly again, sending the captain flying several meters away.
1:7:30|1:7:40|[Fang Zijing] gave the order, and thousands of soldiers armed with spears and blades surged towards [Chen Changxing]. After a series of pushes, [Chen Changxing] knocked down the vanguard soldiers, but faced with more soldiers charging towards him relentlessly.
1:7:40|1:7:47|He could only escape from the ground and jump onto the cannon. Meanwhile, the couple [Yang Luchan] who were still on the ground were engaged in a fierce battle.
1:7:47|1:7:58|The two of them, one fist each, were no match for four hands. In no time, they found themselves surrounded by enemy troops. [Chen Changxing], in order to help them out of the predicament, leaped from the cannon and crossed over the soldiers.
1:7:58|1:7:59|Arrived in front of [Fang Zijing].
1:7:59|1:8:9|The soldiers reacted quickly, holding their spears and thrusting them towards [Chen Changxing]. [Chen Changxing] immediately grabbed [Fang Zijing]'s collar and spun in place, kicking away all the spears thrust at him.
1:8:9|1:8:19|When the soldiers were caught off guard, [Chen Changxing] swiftly incapacitated the closest row of soldiers and maneuvered his spear through the gaps in their bodies. At that moment, [Fang Zijing] broke out in a cold sweat.
1:8:19|1:8:30|As he found that this row of soldiers not only couldn't move, but also blocked a large number of reinforcements behind them, this open space seemed to become a duel ground for the two at this moment. Just as [Fang Zijing] nervously paced back and forth,
1:8:30|1:8:33|The couple flew into the encirclement from outside the crowd.
1:8:35|1:8:46|[Chen Changxing] finished speaking and then delivered several punches in succession. [Fang Zijing] stood like a wooden stake, allowing himself to be beaten. Immediately after, [Chen Changxing] exerted all his strength and with one punch, sent [Fang Zijing] flying out of the crowd.
1:8:53|1:9:1|The officials and soldiers who broke out of the encirclement rushed towards the three like fierce beasts, but in the eyes of the three, such attacks seemed fierce but full of flaws.
1:9:1|1:9:13|The three of them easily broke through the encirclement with their agile pushing hands. However, even with this amazing skill, they found themselves in a tough battle against spears attacking from all directions. After half a day of rest, Fang Zijing also recovered.
1:9:16|1:9:20|He snatched the musket from the soldier's hand, stood on a high place, aimed at [Chen Yuniang] in the crowd,
1:9:20|1:9:29|After all, they were former lovers, so he couldn't bring himself to attack. After hesitating for a moment, he aimed the gun at Yang Luchan again. Chen Changxing saw this and quickly shouted,
1:9:30|1:9:39|Just as [Fang Zijing] was about to pull the trigger, a loud roar of engines came from the sky, before anyone could see clearly, several shells fell from the air.
1:9:40|1:10:2|Yes, it was [Chen Zaiyang] who drove the Tianwei Wing to come to the rescue. The shells projected by Tianwei Wing exploded the soldiers into disarray, causing a large number of them to fall down. The remaining soldiers were also in a panic, not knowing what to do. The soldiers on the ground were no longer interested in fighting the three individuals, but kept looking up at the sky. Attracting everyone's attention, the Tianwei Wing soared into the sky and disappeared from people's sight.
1:10:2|1:10:8|Just when people thought it was over, Tianweiyi unexpectedly circled back from behind and launched a counterattack.
1:10:18|1:10:25|After a round of shooting that didn't harm Tianwei Yi at all, [Fang Zijing] angrily threw away the musket and said to the artillery,
1:10:26|1:10:36|The artillerymen, following orders, quickly climbed onto the cannon to load the shells. [Chen Zaiyang] saw the enemy setting up the cannon, so he turned the handle and fired out the homemade bullets.
1:10:36|1:10:43|The soldiers holding long spears were like lambs to the slaughter, powerless to fight back and falling down at the slightest resistance.
1:10:43|1:10:53|At this moment, [Chen Changxing] looked at the sky where the Tianwei Wings freely soared, unable to speak for a long time. Meanwhile, [Chen Zaiyang] continued to bombard downwards to cover the retreat of the three.
1:10:54|1:11:10|[Fang Zijing] saw the Heavenly Wing swiftly flying past the crowd, then commanded the artillery again. When [Chen Changxing] saw the Heavenly Wing diving towards the crowd, he shouted loudly,
1:11:12|1:11:21|At this moment, the cannon has turned around and adjusted its height to aim at Tianwei Wing. Fortunately, Chen Zaiyang agilely dodged and avoided the cannonball. After dealing with the soldiers in front of him, Chen Changxing turned to his husband.
1:11:23|1:11:28|The two wives said that they seized the opportunity and rushed towards the weakest point of the defense of the soldiers.
1:11:31|1:11:34|At this moment, the Tianwei Wing in the sky suddenly changed its flying posture to a side-wing flight.
1:11:34|1:11:47|The huge wings glided along the ground. In a moment, they arrived behind the two, and as the wings slid between [Yang Luchan] and [Chen Yuniang], the two leaped precisely and firmly grabbed the wings. The numerous soldiers could only watch helplessly as the two flew past them.
1:11:47|1:11:55|Unable to leave, [Fang Zijing] was furious at the sight. He did not allow such a thing to happen, so he shouted to his men,
1:11:56|1:12:11|[Fang Zijing] took the gun and aimed at several people. However, [Chen Zaiyang] loudly taunted, and then threw the final customized shell made for [Fang Zijing], which, after flipping in the air for several rounds, landed accurately in front of [Fang Zijing].
1:12:11|1:12:20|When he realized he wanted to run, it was too late. [Fang Zijing], who was blown away, fell to the ground unconscious, while the three people on the Tianwei Wing soared in the sky, flying further and further.
1:12:20|1:12:25|Chen Changxing breathed a sigh of relief after seeing the three of them escape.
1:12:25|1:12:30|Facing the remaining few remnants of the enemy, if he were to escape at this moment, no one could stop him.
1:12:30|1:12:35|For the sake of the villagers in the village, he chose not to resist and was captured and brought to justice.
1:12:35|1:12:48|At this moment, the couple [Yang Luchan] on the wing is also facing difficulties, as the strong airflow from high-speed flight makes it difficult for them to move. Just then, the Tianwei Wing, which was flying steadily just now, suddenly became unstable.
1:12:48|1:12:54|[Chen Zaiyang] discovered the anomaly of the Tianwei Wing, and then used the mechanical armor to support himself, keeping it balanced.
1:12:54|1:13:3|The two on the wing also seized the opportunity, tightly gripping the railing, as the Tianwei Wing seemed to reach its limit.
1:13:3|1:13:12|[Chen Zaiyang] looked at the frequent mechanical issues and shouted loudly,
1:13:22|1:13:32|After speaking, [Chen Zaiyang] unexpectedly leaped without hesitation and plunged down from the Tianwei Wing. Falling from this kilometer-high altitude, even a great immortal would not be able to escape death.
1:13:33|1:13:39|Just as the two looked on in despair at the sacrifice of their eldest brother, [Chen Zaiyang] forcefully pulled off the iron ring from his chest.
1:13:39|1:13:50|A large parachute suddenly rose up. [Chen Zaiyang] managed to save his life, but dozens of soldiers were already waiting for his landing below. After landing, [Chen Zaiyang] faced the encirclement. Just as he was about to adopt a fighting stance,
1:13:50|1:14:0|Covered by the parachute on his head, the officials rushed forward and started punching and kicking [Chen Zaiyang]. Meanwhile, in the government office in the capital city, foreigners were taking photos of Prince Bei.
1:14:1|1:14:12|The flash of the camera was so bright that it made the prince unable to open his eyes. The foreigner noticed that the prince's eyes were closed in the photo, so he said to the prince's men,
1:14:23|1:14:32|After pondering for a moment, Prince Bei not only did not get angry, but burst into laughter.
1:14:45|1:14:54|At this moment, a minister hurriedly walked up to [Chen Youzhi] and whispered something in his ear.
1:15:5|1:15:17|After sending off the minister, [Chen Youzhi] turned to [Prince Bei] and humorously remarked that both he and Master Li closed their eyes together.
1:15:18|1:15:23|Returning to Chen Family Valley once again, after [Chen Changxing] was taken away, Duke [Fei Linming] also arrived in a carriage.
1:15:24|1:15:37|Duke [Fei Linming] walked into a simple wooden shed under the guidance of the soldiers. [Fang Zijing], covered in wounds, lay gasping for breath on a bench. Despite his tattered official attire and disheveled appearance, his expression remained full of anger.
1:15:52|1:15:58|At the same time, in the neighboring village, Tianweiyi fell on the roof, while [Yang Luchan] and [Chen Yuniang] hid in the stable on the side.
1:16:1|1:16:10|Upon hearing Chen Yuniang's question, Yang Luchan couldn't come up with a good solution for a moment. Just then, a horse stuck its head out in front of the two, and after glancing at the horse, Yang Luchan smirked mischievously at Chen Yuniang.
1:16:12|1:16:17|So [Yang Luchan] mounted his horse and, with [Chen Yuniang], galloped non-stop towards the capital city.
1:16:17|1:16:27|The two of them, burdened with heavy responsibilities, never stopped working tirelessly, knowing that they were the hope of the whole village. In the evening, in the prison,
1:16:27|1:16:30|The prison guard pushed [Chen Zaiyang] in.
1:16:44|1:16:54|After being pushed to the ground, [Chen Zaiyang] got up and shouted angrily. As he turned around to finish his sentence, he saw his father [Chen Changxing] meditating with his eyes closed, in deep concentration.
1:16:54|1:17:2|[Chen Zaiyang] saw his father and instinctively lowered his head, moving to the corner with fear and guilt. At this moment, [Chen Changxing] spoke up,
1:17:6|1:17:14|[Chen Zaiyang], who was already accustomed to such lessons, said,
1:17:30|1:17:39|[Chen Zaiyang] looked at his father in disbelief as he heard these words. [Chen Changxing] said sincerely,
1:18:32|1:18:50|Chen Changxing angrily threw the torn paper on the ground, the words "Heavenly Wing" still visible on the broken paper. Chen Zaiyang tremblingly picked up the debris from the ground, slowly stood up, and looked at Chen Changxing with a heart as lifeless as ashes.
1:18:53|1:19:2|[Chen Zaiyang] looked at the person who ruined his own dream, retreated while saying, then he roared and ran towards the courtyard.
1:19:2|1:19:8|[Chen Changxing] realized that his words were too harsh, as he watched his son's figure walking away, he also felt a bit at a loss for a moment.
1:19:8|1:19:17|Chen Changxing, who has always been strict, did not catch up. In the prison, Chen Changxing said from the bottom of his heart,
1:19:22|1:19:33|He looked at his tearful son in front of him and called out softly. After that, [Chen Changxing] slowly reached out his hands towards his son, and [Chen Zaiyang] happily rushed forward to hold them.
1:19:34|1:19:46|At the moment when their hands touched, [Chen Zaiyang] could no longer hide the grievance in his heart. He sobbed loudly on his father's chest, after so many years of effort and perseverance, finally gaining his father's approval in this moment.
1:19:47|1:19:52|At this moment, even the stern Chen Changxing couldn't help but shed tears in his eyes after decades of severity.
1:19:55|1:20:5|In the bustling capital city, the streets and alleys are full of prosperity, with numerous shops of all sizes and a constant stream of customers. [Chen Changxing] carries a heavy responsibility,
1:20:6|1:20:12|But seeing this scene, [Chen Changxing] couldn't help but look around. At this moment, a large crowd gathered in front of the billboard in front of him.
1:20:12|1:20:19|[Chen Changxing] also curiously approached to take a look, but when he got closer, he found that the wanted poster of the couple was posted on the bulletin board.
1:20:19|1:20:31|Seeing this situation, [Chen Changxing] knew that time was running out. Following previous instructions, he arrived at the luxurious and exquisite clock shop of the Bagua Sect's head of the Dui palm, [Chen Changxing] paused for a moment in front of the shop before walking in.
1:20:31|1:20:41|At this moment, the shopkeeper was concentrating on repairing the pocket watch in the quiet upstairs. Soon, the waiter who learned about the couple's intentions hurriedly ran up.
1:20:51|1:20:57|After speaking, the shopkeeper handed over the token entrusted to Chen Changxing to Yang Luchan. Seeing this token, the shopkeeper immediately put down the tools in his hands.
1:20:57|1:21:6|Walking downstairs with the waiter, [Chen Changxing] said,
1:21:19|1:21:26|[Yang Luchan] finished speaking and assumed a stance. He was about to spar with [Chen Changxing], ready to strike at any moment. As the leader of the Duizi style, he naturally possessed profound skills and had been through numerous battles.
1:21:26|1:21:32|Just from the calm and composed posture of [Yang Luchan], one can tell that he is not an ordinary person.
1:21:32|1:21:40|He hesitated to make a move for a long time, but after observing for a while, he struck with a palm strike. However, [Yang Luchan] instantly dodged and counterattacked by hitting his ribs, pushing the master away.
1:21:40|1:21:57|Unexpectedly, before the sect leader could stabilize, he swiftly struck towards the chest of [Yang Luchan]. Unable to dodge in time, [Yang Luchan] leaned back and used the internal strength of [Chen Family Fist] to dissipate the force of the blow. Following that, he immediately countered with a strike leveraging the force, pushing the leader of the Duizhang sect back several meters. With the exchange between masters reaching this point, the outcome had already been determined.
1:22:9|1:22:21|As the head of the Duizi sect said, the Bagua sect has eight sect leaders. In addition to the Duizi sect leader, there are also seven other sect leaders, namely Qianzi, Kanzi, Genzi, Zhenzi, Xunzi, Lizi, and Kunzi.
1:22:21|1:22:29|Following the guidance of the head of the Duizi sect, [Yang Luchan] went to seek advice with the Bagua disc in hand, in order to meet the Grand Master [Master Li].
1:22:29|1:22:35|After the other seven sect leaders learned of Yang Luchan's purpose, they all displayed their unique skills and treated him with respect.
1:22:35|1:22:43|These eight sect leaders, although from the same school, have vastly different martial arts techniques, ranging from extreme yin to extreme yang, each unique in their own way. Some are extremely domineering, while others hide a knife behind a smile.
1:22:45|1:22:52|Even so, in the face of the [Chen Family Fist] that [Yang Luchan] comprehended with great care, these ever-changing moves were like child's play. After a round of sparring, these accomplished leaders who could stand on their own.
1:22:54|1:22:58|Not only did [Yang Luchan] not get hurt at all, but he was also spared by him everywhere.
1:22:58|1:23:6|[Yang Luchan] also demonstrated the essence of Chinese martial arts to the fullest, impressing the onlookers who applauded enthusiastically.
1:23:6|1:23:19|After defeating the head of the Kanzi sect, [Yang Luchan] successfully passed the seventh level. At this moment, in the kitchen of Prince Bei's mansion, soldiers sent by [Master Li] to observe secretly came to report, while [Master Li] was supervising the kitchen with his back to the door.
1:23:50|1:23:57|When Master Liu was about to fall heavily from the second floor, [Yang Luchan] quickly supported him.
1:24:1|1:24:5|After Headmaster Liu finished speaking, he took [Yang Luchan] and his wife to Prince Bei's mansion.
1:24:5|1:24:10|Master Li led the two of them all the way to the kitchen and said to them,
1:24:32|1:24:39|In the midst of the conversation, a chef turned around with a plate, and [Master Li] instantly dodged to the side and agilely stepped in front of him.
1:24:57|1:25:4|[Master Li] continued to move forward without saying a word. Although he was a prominent figure by the prince's side, the matter at hand was of great importance, making it difficult for him to influence the situation.
1:25:4|1:25:9|[Yang Luchan] and [Chen Yuniang] saw [Master Li] shuttling back and forth in the kitchen, so they knelt down anxiously and greeted him with clasped hands.
1:25:9|1:25:17|When they looked up, they found that [Master Li] was kneeling on the ground in the same posture, but the person he was kneeling to was Prince Bei on the second floor.
1:25:17|1:25:23|Upon seeing the prince come out, [Master Li] confidently said,
1:25:32|1:25:40|Prince Bei did not immediately respond after hearing this, but slowly raised his noble hand, palm facing upwards, lightly flicked his four fingers, and said,
1:25:40|1:25:46|Upon hearing the prince's voice, everyone in the kitchen immediately bowed and stood up straight.
1:26:35|1:26:44|[Yang Luchan] just with a bow, quietly took the sesame cake on the table in front of everyone. The prince was very satisfied with this response and said,
1:27:1|1:27:16|Training is not a problem, but [Chen Yuniang] looked at the compactly arranged kitchen with boilers and tables and chairs, feeling puzzled. After looking around, she asked in confusion, while [Yang Luchan] had just turned around to follow [Li Qiankun], [Chen Yuniang] anxiously grabbed his wrist.
1:27:25|1:27:29|Li Qiankun walked towards the stairs as he spoke, and his hands were covered in white flour at the corner.
1:27:29|1:27:37|When he reached the middle of the stairs, he suddenly jumped onto the handrail, using his top-notch lightness skill to step on the wooden screen between the boilers. The screen was originally used to separate the boilers.
1:27:37|1:27:43|Its width is only a little over three fingers, which makes it difficult for ordinary people to stand upright, let alone compete here.
1:27:43|1:27:49|In just a moment, [Yang Luchan] had quietly eaten up all the stolen sesame cakes without anyone noticing.
1:27:49|1:27:52|Upon seeing [Li Qiankun] assume a stance, he also stepped onto the screen.
1:27:52|1:28:2|Yang Luchan's light work is on par with Li Qiankun's, with slight swaying under his feet, but his upper body remains motionless, as steady as Mount Tai. In the blink of an eye, he circles around Li Qiankun on the screen,
1:28:4|1:28:13|Standing in front and assuming a stance, [Li Qiankun] looked at [Yang Luchan]'s skills with great satisfaction. Just as he was about to make a move, he found that there was no movement under his feet. Dozens of chefs all looked up and turned their attention to the two.
1:28:28|1:28:33|After staring at each other for a long time, [Li Qiankun] couldn't hold back and made the first move.
1:28:33|1:28:44|Interlocking his hands in front of him to feint an attack, the next second he swiftly kicked [Yang Luchan] on the shoulder. Seeing [Yang Luchan] withstand his kick and still stand on the screen, [Li Qiankun] immediately followed up with a direct strike to the face, continuing the assault.
1:29:4|1:29:15|After a moment, the two of them seized the opportunity and each struck a palm towards the other's chest, causing both of them to fly backwards. After flying back to their original positions and circulating their qi in the dantian, this first round of probing finally came to an end.
1:29:19|1:29:28|The prince upstairs praised, "Li Qiankun has changed his posture and is making another move." Li Qiankun, who had previously gained some insights from Chen Ersao's boxing, intends to use Chen-style boxing against Yang Luchan.
1:29:28|1:29:40|The two's body movements, techniques, attacks, and defenses are completely identical, making it difficult to distinguish between them for a moment. Both of them have also comprehended the principles of Chen Family Fist and the integration with natural life. Just like the fish simmering in the oil pan at this moment,
1:29:40|1:29:47|The two on the screen are spinning and making their moves again. [Li Qiankun], an outsider, has only had a few exchanges and already grasped the essence of the [Chen Family Fist].
1:29:47|1:29:52|Although [Yang Luchan] was not injured, his attacks were all deftly neutralized by [Li Qiankun].
1:29:52|1:30:2|[Yang Luchan]'s hand-covering fist was easily resolved by [Li Qiankun]'s pushing hand, and immediately followed by a single whip. Before [Yang Luchan] could finish defending, [Li Qiankun] swept in with a white crane spreading its wings.
1:30:2|1:30:9|[Yang Luchan] managed to dodge in time, but was still caught off guard. Just as [Li Qiankun] made his move, [Yang Luchan] was able to seize the opportunity.
1:30:9|1:30:13|A whirlwind kick almost kicked Li Qiankun off the screen.
1:30:13|1:30:18|Fortunately, with Li Qiankun's lower body firmly rooted, he effortlessly extended his legs back onto the screen.
1:30:19|1:30:27|The two then exchanged palm strikes again and flew backwards. In the midst of the skilled martial artists in the capital city, [Li Qiankun], who was firmly seated in the leading position, fought several rounds.
1:30:27|1:30:37|Although neither was at a disadvantage nor gained any advantage. Just as the two separated to gather their energy, the sweet and sour carp under their feet happened to be ready, filling the entire kitchen with its tempting aroma.
1:30:38|1:30:45|[Yang Luchan] couldn't help but swallow after hearing it, and after being reprimanded by [Chen Yuniang], [Yang Luchan] refocused all his attention on the martial arts competition.
1:30:45|1:30:51|At this moment, it seems that he has grasped the principle of the interdependence of all things. In the eyes of others, he appears to be standing still.
1:30:51|1:30:55|Only he himself could see the scene of the two of them fighting next with his heart.
1:30:55|1:31:3|After several rounds of fighting, [Li Qiankun]'s moves were mostly seen through by [Yang Luchan]. After a moment, he finally saw a way to defeat [Li Qiankun].
1:31:4|1:31:10|Upstairs, Prince Bei watched the two who hesitated to make a move with suspicion, but as a spectator, he did not speak out to disturb them.
1:31:10|1:31:17|After a moment, the integrated [Yang Luchan] stood on one foot on the screen, transforming into a wedge shape with the moves of the Vajra Pound.
1:31:18|1:31:26|[Li Qiankun] saw the opponent changing moves, and he also prepared a countermeasure. This time, [Yang Luchan] took the lead and rushed towards [Li Qiankun]. Just as he was about to make a move, [Yang Luchan] suddenly changed direction,
1:31:28|1:31:39|Flying to the left side behind [Li Qiankun], a swift airborne kick directly hits [Li Qiankun]'s face, catching him off guard. Without panic, [Li Qiankun] dodges and counters with a cloud hand strike to the vital point.
1:31:39|1:31:51|[Yang Luchan] did not evade this move, spinning several times in the air. But as soon as he landed, he was caught off guard by the experienced [Li Qiankun], who delivered a hammer strike to his ear. [Li Qiankun] thought this strike would surely hit, but to his surprise, [Yang Luchan] suddenly moved like water.
1:31:51|1:31:59|Like a carp, agile and flexible, easily dodging attacks with a soft waist. In the moment of surprise for [Li Qiankun], [Yang Luchan] strikes towards his abdomen.
1:31:59|1:32:5|Li Qiankun realized that he could no longer avoid it. Unexpectedly, Yang Luchan suddenly stopped and then used the momentum to spin in the air.
1:32:5|1:32:17|During the reversal, [Yang Luchan] got his hands covered with the flour imprint on his chest and struck [Li Qiankun] on the chest. The enlightened [Yang Luchan] then became unstoppable, countering every move with ease, neutralizing all of [Li Qiankun]'s attacks.
1:32:17|1:32:24|Instead, [Yang Luchan] began to hold back again. After [Yang Luchan] lightly pushed a palm, the two of them regained their strength. At this moment, the sound of bells rang under their feet.
1:33:50|1:33:59|The prince asked Yang Luchan after hearing this.
1:34:18|1:34:26|Having defeated [Li Qiankun] and gained the approval of [Prince Bei], the happy couple embraced each other excitedly.
1:34:53|1:35:6|Father and son walked up the mountain in tattered clothes to [Chen Family Valley], and the people who had received the news had already gathered at the mountaintop to welcome them. Seeing their father and elder brother safe and sound despite their disheveled appearance, the children couldn't hide their joy.
1:35:6|1:35:11|[Chen Changxing] saw his children and elders again, his eyes becoming moist.
1:35:11|1:35:19|The loving couple [Chen Zaiyang] embraced each other in tears. Just as the whole family was immersed in the atmosphere of reunion, the little girl shouted to everyone,
