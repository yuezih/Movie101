0:3:51|0:4:13|The voice gradually lowered, [Li Zhongzhi] arrived at a gift shop, approached a display case, then picked up a silver bracelet on the glass counter, wrapped it in a paper bag, and then went to a restaurant where his daughter was sitting across from him.
0:4:14|0:4:23|After Li Yongzhi finished speaking, she continued to lower her head and play with her phone, looking very unnatural. Just as Li Yongzhi was about to speak, a boy walked in from the restaurant aisle.
0:4:27|0:4:38|Henry sat next to [Li Yongzhi], with [Li Zhongzhi] staring at Henry. Seeing the interaction between the two, [Li Zhongzhi] sighed and asked Henry,
0:5:16|0:5:30|[Li Yongzhi] looked earnestly, seeing his daughter tearfully expressing her desire to have a child. [Li Zhongzhi] clenched his teeth and stared at him with determination, not saying a word for a long time. The scene then shifted to an ultrasound image showing a baby.
0:5:37|0:5:46|The couple smiled happily, and the scene shifted to a very romantic restaurant. At this moment, the husband and wife heard the middle-aged man across from them asking if they had chosen a name for the child.
0:6:43|0:7:2|The scene shifts, [Li Yongzhi] arrives in Pattaya, Thailand. She is walking slowly along a seawall in Pattaya, the weather is gloomy, and her expression is very dark. Suddenly, a man with his face covered approaches [Li Yongzhi] from behind and covers her mouth and nose with a towel.
0:7:3|0:7:10|And dragged her into a vehicle parked by the riverbank. The vehicle, with [Li Yongzhi] abducted, drove along an empty path.
0:7:11|0:7:24|The latter slowly opened her eyes as the car swayed, reaching into her bag for her phone while lying in the back seat. Before she could press any keys, the car stopped in front of a secluded bamboo house, the door.
0:7:24|0:7:49|The scene opens with [Li Yongzhi] hurriedly stuffing his phone into the carpet and closing his eyes. The scene shifts to a secret room where [Li Yongzhi] is shackled with handcuffs and leg irons, crying and sweating as he screams towards the end, seemingly calling for his father. Fortunately, this is just a nightmare of [Li Zhongzhi]. Startled, he gets up from the bed and walks into the kitchen to make juice with a blender.
0:7:50|0:8:2|The phone placed on the dining table kept vibrating, so he walked over with the freshly made juice, took a sip, made a face, and then answered the phone.
0:8:6|0:8:33|Upon hearing this, [Li Zhongzhi] stopped chewing on his fruit bits, immediately hung up the phone, and then arrived in Thailand. The weather on this day was as gloomy as when [Li Yongzhi] was abducted. In the bustling streets of Thailand, a taxi slowly pulled up in front of a hotel. After the car came to a stop, [Li Zhongzhi] got out of the back seat carrying a bag. A girl who was originally waiting at the hotel entrance came forward to greet him.
0:8:35|0:8:41|He turned out to be a friend of [Li Yongzhi], Jenny. [Li Zhongzhi] put his arm around her shoulder and they walked into the hotel together.
0:8:41|0:8:55|The waiter opened a door, and [Li Zhongzhi] and Jenny rushed in. After throwing down the bag, [Li Zhongzhi] glanced at the door and windows, shook them hard, and then took two steps back. He then walked towards the small desk by the window.
0:8:55|0:9:14|Beside the desk, [Li Zhongzhi] first picked up a book and flipped through it, finding nothing. Then he noticed a piece of paper with a butterfly print on the side, followed by a photo that seemed casually taken. Finally, he picked up a small booklet with only promotional graphics printed on it, containing no useful information.
0:9:14|0:9:25|After leaving the desk, he came to the dressing table, pulled out a suitcase from below, couldn't unlock it, so he forcefully twisted it, opened the latch, flipped out a camera from inside, and then there was nothing left.
0:9:26|0:9:40|Li Zhongzhi, who had found nothing, dropped the box and opened his sleeves, sitting firmly on a stool observing the room. On the other side, a car drove up the small road and stopped at the hotel entrance. The people next to the police car immediately tried to be friendly towards him.
0:9:40|0:9:48|The pregnant woman's husband, Li Zhongzhi, wearing sunglasses, got out of the car and walked into the hotel.
0:10:15|0:10:28|[Cui Jie] looked into the room, where [Li Zhongzhi] was sitting by the window lost in thought. She then walked slowly into the room, glanced at the hotel bed, picked up the broken lock from the suitcase, looked around, and then heard a noise.
0:10:34|0:10:41|[Li Zhongzhi] stood up from the window, [Cui Jie] walked to his side. After listening, [Cui Jie] reached out his right hand.
0:10:54|0:11:2|[Cui Jie] walked out the door, nodded to [Li Zhongzhi], and then followed. Jenny waited at the door and [Li Zhongzhi] arrived at the police station with Jenny.
0:11:54|0:12:10|The scene shifts to the restaurant where Li Zhongzhi had previously given his daughter a birthday gift. He pulls back the curtain, exits the restroom, and returns to his seat. Sitting down, he stares intensely at Henry and swallows hard. At this moment, a man and a woman approach their table.
0:12:46|0:13:1|[Li Zhongzhi] shook his head in resignation and replied, [Cui Jie] glanced at the other party, then handed over the transcript. Instead of taking it, [Li Zhongzhi] asked,
0:13:12|0:13:31|[Li Zhongzhi] sat up straight after listening, signed his name with his right hand a few times, then walked out of the room. As he passed by the gate, police officer Ade was escorting a male prisoner in. [Li Zhongzhi] sat on a chair by the door, waiting for [Cui Jie]'s response. Suddenly, the prisoner turned around and knocked Ade's sunglasses off, landing them at [Li Zhongzhi]'s feet.
0:13:31|0:13:35|Ade lifted his knee and pressed towards the male prisoner's legs.
0:13:41|0:13:55|Seeing the sunglasses drop at his feet, [Li Zhongzhi] picked them up and handed them back to Ade, who patted his shoulder in thanks. Suddenly, images of [Cui Jie] with a bleeding head appeared in his mind. Ade then walked into the room and saw [Cui Jie] making a copy of [Li Zhongzhi]'s passport, and asked him.
0:14:22|0:14:39|After patting Ade's shoulder, he walked towards the waiting area outside the door, and then returned the original passports to Jenny and [Li Zhongzhi] who were there to record statements. After being given permission to leave, [Li Zhongzhi] followed Jenny to the tattoo shop where her boyfriend worked.
0:14:40|0:14:46|Jenny handed a piece of paper to [Li Zhongzhi] sitting on the bench.
0:15:10|0:15:25|Seeing Li Yongzhi's determination, Jenny turned on the machine and started working on the design. It was a little painful. Li Yongzhi shifted her gaze from the tattoo to look out the window. As the memories faded, Li Zhongzhi sat on the stool and spoke to Jenny.
0:15:26|0:15:31|Then he returned the tattoo paper to her and turned back to look at the chair where [Li Yongzhi] had been lying when getting the tattoo.
0:15:42|0:15:53|The scene shifts to the lounge, where [Aziz] is still adjusting the pronunciation of the script. At this moment, his aide [Zheng Hanshou] corrects him, saying that everyone should believe that the emphasis should be placed on themselves.
0:15:53|0:15:56|Instead of everyone going up, [Aziz] stood up straight and read it again.
0:16:10|0:16:22|Aziz was re-elected as the next mayor. As Zheng Hanshou corrected the lighting position at the press conference, he suddenly heard from the walkie-talkie his subordinate saying,
0:16:25|0:16:49|[Zheng Hanshou] hurriedly came down from the stage, walking and making a phone call to notify the doctor that [Aziz] would arrive soon and they needed to be prepared for treatment. After hanging up the phone, he saw a stack of chairs in the corner and came up with a plan. Opening the door, he quickly walked past the reporters and arrived at the room where [Aziz] had fainted. He first asked if the latter had taken any medication, then reached past the mayor's wife to hold [Aziz]'s hand.
0:16:49|0:16:54|He then unbuttoned his shirt and instructed his henchman [Arnold] to block the staff passage.
0:17:1|0:17:26|The chairs that were stacked in the press conference hall were now pushed out from the room, with the inner side of the chairs facing the reporters. [Aziz] was conveniently blocked by the backrest of a chair. Upon reaching the artificial passage, a wheelchair was brought by [Zheng Hanshou]. After placing [Aziz] on it, he pressed the emergency button, instructed [Arnold] to inform the reporters to cancel today's press conference, and then pushed [Aziz] towards the depths of the staff passage.
0:17:36|0:17:41|Under the command of [Zheng Hanshou], [Aziz] was smoothly taken to a private hospital on the other side.
0:18:2|0:18:9|He said that [Aziz] needs to undergo a heart transplant surgery, but there is no need to worry, as the latter will definitely be re-elected as mayor smoothly. After gaining the approval of General Long, [Zheng Hanshou] thanked him.
0:18:12|0:18:18|He hung up the phone and put it in the pocket of his suit, then started making a plan while looking out the window of the ward.
0:18:20|0:18:33|At this moment on the streets of Thailand, [Cui Jie] and [Li Zhongzhi] arrived at the last known location of [Li Yongzhi]'s phone based on the clues.
0:18:45|0:19:4|[Li Zhongzhi] looked hopefully at the camera, with [Cui Jie] standing on his left and [Zheng Hanshou] on his right, they fast-forwarded through the video footage on the computer at the store, then moved on to the next one. They entered a coffee shop, where [Cui Jie] once again displayed his police badge and requested to view the surveillance footage. However, even after fast-forwarding through the footage, they still found nothing.
0:19:4|0:19:8|The two of them went from one street to another, asking at each house, until it was late at night.
0:19:38|0:20:11|Then [Li Zhongzhi] asked the girl next to Xiao Man and received a negative answer, so he slowly left. In another convenience store, [Cui Jie] was on the phone comforting [Sang Er]. Suddenly, [Li Zhongzhi] noticed on the monitor that [Li Yongzhi] walked in from outside, and also spotted a suspicious man who had been following her. He approached the screen to take a closer look, and the monitor showed [Li Yongzhi] picking things from the shelf while the suspicious man in a baseball cap pretended to be shopping.
0:20:11|0:20:21|When Li Yongzhi walked out of the convenience store after making a purchase, the suspicious man immediately followed her from behind. Li Zhongzhi moved the mouse and brought up two images, saying,
0:20:26|0:20:44|[Cui Jie] pressed his right hand on the chair, his left hand on the table, and watched the surveillance video with [Li Zhongzhi] carefully. After discovering something, he immediately rushed out towards the door. Following [Cui Jie], [Li Zhongzhi] also ran out. The two of them looked around on the street, then headed towards the direction where [Li Yongzhi] had left, which was to the left front of the convenience store.
0:20:45|0:21:3|Just ahead, there was a surveillance camera under the eaves of a storefront. They immediately walked inside and checked the footage. The suspicious man happened to take off his hat in front of the camera, revealing his face. [Cui Jie] drove with [Li Zhongzhi] and parked in front of the billiard hall.
0:21:5|0:21:12|After Cui Jie finished speaking, he opened the car door, got out, closed the door, looked around, and then slowly walked into the billiard hall from the main entrance.
0:21:12|0:21:37|At this moment, [Li Zhongzhi] sitting in the car glanced around, suddenly a man wearing a baseball cap walked from the sidewalk in front of the car. As the man approached the vehicle and his face became clearer, [Li Zhongzhi] confirmed that he was the suspicious man. The man then walked into the side door of the billiard hall, urgently looking for the whereabouts of [Li Yongzhi]. Without waiting any longer, [Li Zhongzhi] immediately opened the door, got out of the car, and headed towards the billiard hall.
0:21:37|0:22:4|At this moment, the man came to the bar and asked the waitress for a bottle of beer, eyeing her up and down. Then, [Li Zhongzhi] walked up to him and stared at him without moving. The man, feeling threatened, was about to grab the beer and leave, but was stopped by a hand on his shoulder from behind. He tried to swing the beer bottle at [Li Zhongzhi], but was punched and sent flying. Seeing the man's friend stepping in to stop [Li Zhongzhi], he grabbed the man and used his whole body to crash into his friend.
0:22:5|0:22:28|After knocking the man down, she performed a shoulder throw and then kicked fiercely at the man's chest. The sound of the fight caught the attention of [Cui Jie], who walked over from the main entrance. Seeing the suspicious man about to run, he immediately flipped over the bar and chased after him. The two of them ran out of the billiard hall, weaving through the alley, and then one after the other flipped over the roadside railing.
0:22:28|0:22:41|In the billiard room, after knocking down the last two people, [Li Zhongzhi] also followed them out immediately. At this time, [Cui Jie] and the suspicious man arrived on the street, then ran a distance, crossed the street, and entered a motorcycle parking lot.
0:22:41|0:23:10|The two of them jumped off the motorcycle seats like playing whack-a-mole. After flipping over about 10 motorcycles, they ran onto the main road filled with cars, one in front of the other. On the other side, [Li Zhongzhi] ran out from an alley, looked around, and quickly chased after the two figures. The three of them ran in a straight line, with the man in the front suddenly turning and darting through the traffic. [Li Zhongzhi] also immediately ran towards the traffic and jumped in.
0:23:10|0:23:14|After flying over the body of a car, crashing through the front windshield of another car, he got up and continued running.
0:23:15|0:23:31|At this moment, the man sneaked into a game hall, bumped into a delivery worker, slipped and fell out. [Cui Jie] used his foot brake to grab the man's collar, who shook him off and ran forward again. The camera then shifted to the tourist area of the game hall, watching as the man was about to jump into the sea to escape.
0:23:33|0:23:51|[Cui Jie] climbed over the railing and grabbed the man tightly around the waist, pulling him into the sea. By the railing, [Li Zhongzhi] and a group of people looked down. The man was taken to the police station, where [A Bin] was questioning him about why he was following [Li Yongzhi]. He claimed he was innocent.
0:24:2|0:24:26|After listening to Cui Jie unlock the phone and show some photos from the album, Li Zhongzhi took it and immediately froze. The phone displayed images of Li Yongzhi's legs and skirt, clearly taken from a voyeuristic angle. Li Zhongzhi quickly stood up, scrolled through the phone, then handed it back to Cui Jie. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath.
0:24:27|0:24:46|[Cui Jie] wanted to comfort him behind his back, but couldn't find the right words. Then [Li Zhongzhi] suddenly opened his eyes, turned around, pushed open the door of the police station, picked up the ceramic cup on the table, and hit the man on the head. Seeing him losing control of his emotions, [Cui Jie] and Ade pulled him out of the door from both sides.
0:24:46|0:25:14|Yes, after waiting for a while, [Li Zhongzhi] slowly calmed down and caught his breath. The two people holding him gradually released their hands from his shoulders. On the other side, the man who was beaten was restrained by A Bin, ordered not to move. Seeing this, [Li Zhongzhi] gritted his teeth, caught his breath, ran his fingers through his hair, and walked out of the police station with empty eyes. Behind him, [Cui Jie] stood with his hands on his hips, looking worriedly at [Li Zhongzhi]'s figure.
0:25:15|0:25:19|And Adi suddenly touched the talisman on his body and found it had fallen off.
0:25:21|0:25:27|The scene cuts to [Cui Jie] entering Ad's office and sitting down at his desk.
0:25:44|0:25:51|As he walked, he took off the handcuffs from his own wrist and then had [Cui Jie] extend his hand to put them on the other person's wrist.
0:25:59|0:26:6|After Adi gave away the bracelet on his hand and walked out of the office, [Cui Jie] lowered his head and looked at the bracelet on his right hand.
0:26:24|0:26:30|Later, the car drove into the control room, while on the other side of the factory, workers were orderly disassembling, packaging, and transporting the pigs.
0:26:32|0:26:43|At this moment, the two entered the control room. [Zheng Hanshou] heard the mention of the price and immediately handed over the thick paper bag in his hand, instructing the other party to meet his demands.
0:27:17|0:27:37|The bearded foreigner quickly drank the equivalent of two people's worth of alcohol, then took the sign from [Zheng Hanshou] in the control room and walked out. Passing by the operating meat grinder, he threw the sign on top of the grinder, then walked through the row of pigs hanging upside down. The scene fades to black, and in the darkness, a person is seen drawing blood with a syringe from the skin.
0:27:37|0:27:50|After being selected, this person fell down. The sunlight shone on her face through the cracks. It turned out to be [Li Yongzhi]. As the camera pulled back, it revealed that [Li Yongzhi] was tied up on the ground with her hands and feet shackled to the door and window. There were many others around her.
0:27:51|0:27:59|After the phlebotomist finished his work, he walked up the stairs and closed the door. On the other side, on the streets of Thailand at night, the prostitute [Xiao Man] was drinking with her companions in front of a bar.
0:28:0|0:28:20|A car drove up and stopped beside her. Then [Xiao Man] walked around the front of the car towards the driver's seat. The driver called out to [Xiao Man], who awkwardly grinned and then walked around to the passenger seat. At this moment, she saw the driver's face - it turned out to be the police officer [A Bin] from the police station.
0:28:20|0:28:26|On the hot morning of the next day, [Cui Jie] brought [Li Zhongzhi] to the temple to inquire if they had seen [Li Yongzhi].
0:28:32|0:28:38|Then he slowly walked forward, staring at the Buddha statue lost in memories,
0:28:51|0:29:16|Outside the operating room, [Li Zhongzhi] sat on a chair with his elbows on his knees, looking towards the door with a serious expression. As he finished reminiscing, he now had his hands clasped together, eyes closed, furrowing his brows, praying towards a Buddha statue. Suddenly, he heard the phone ringing next to him. Using his right hand with a bracelet on, he answered the call attentively. Then, he looked towards the direction where [Li Zhongzhi] was praying, and spoke into the phone, saying they would hurry over.
0:29:21|0:29:26|Cui Jie squinted at Li Zhongzhi and the latter's upturned mouth, which had been praying, immediately drooped.
0:29:28|0:29:48|At this moment, [Cui Jie] was driving with [Li Zhongzhi] towards their destination. As they turned and passed through an intersection, they caught sight of the sea in the distance. As they approached, they saw a large crowd ahead, along with TV reporters conducting interviews. Seeing the flashing police cars, [Cui Jie] gradually pulled the car to the side of the road and came to a stop.
0:29:48|0:29:54|Li Zhongzhi got out of the car before it had even stopped, slammed the door shut, and walked towards the police cordon.
0:29:56|0:30:19|Behind, [Cui Jie] hurriedly put on the police uniform and caught up with him. After showing the police badge, he led [Li Zhongzhi] into the cordon. With wide eyes, [Li Zhongzhi] looked around like a headless fly. After asking about the direction of the body, [Cui Jie] quickly led him towards the bottom of the embankment. Seeing [Li Zhongzhi] breaking through the cordon, a police officer stopped him, but he was signaled to let him pass by [Cui Jie]. Then the two hurried to the stairs next to the body.
0:30:21|0:30:31|A Bin stood under the stairs and pointed to the body for [Cui Jie], who slowly walked to the side of the body. [Li Zhongzhi] stood on the stairs, staring blankly and panting heavily, then shifted his gaze to the side.
0:30:31|0:30:37|What did he suddenly discover next? He took another look at the body and found that the feet of the corpse were very thick.
0:30:37|0:30:57|Standing next to the corpse, [Cui Jie] turned around and looked at [Li Zhongzhi] with a pained expression. The latter finally made up his mind at this moment, gritted his teeth, glanced upward to the side, then pursed his lips and rushed down the stairs. Squatting beside the body immersed in water, he directly lifted the white cloth covering her head for a quick glance, then instantly restored the cloth to its original state.
0:30:58|0:31:20|Then his whole body gradually calmed down, gritting his teeth, tears streaming down the left cheek of [Li Zhongzhi]. He first wiped the tears on his left shoulder's shirt, then rolled his eyes, quickly turned and walked up the stairs, taking out his phone from his pants pocket as he walked. He showed the photo of [Li Yongzhi] to the journalists who were taking pictures, indicating that his daughter had been missing for 6 days.
0:31:31|0:31:37|Behind him, [Cui Jie] saw [Li Yongzhi], realizing that she might not be in danger yet, which relieved him a bit. The two of them then got back into the car.
0:31:53|0:31:59|The latter took the medicine bottle and finally showed a slight smile on his face. At this moment, [Cui Jie]'s phone rang, and he answered it with a smile.
0:32:46|0:32:52|Crying, [Sang Er] slowly placed the phone receiver next to her belly.
0:33:59|0:34:7|In the corridor outside the emergency room, [Li Zhongzhi], with his face cut by glass, sat on a bench holding his daughter, quietly sobbing as he pressed his lips together in response to her questioning.
0:34:7|0:34:23|At this moment, [Li Zhongzhi] arrived outside the ward, his mouth turned down as he stared straight at the hospital bed. On the bed, [Sang Er] tightly held [Cui Jie]'s hand, the latter sitting beside her, occasionally touching her belly. Seeing this, [Li Zhongzhi] slowly stepped back, eventually turned around and walked out of the hospital.
0:34:34|0:34:44|[Cui Jie] stood up, clasped his hands together in gratitude towards the doctor, then kissed [Sang Er]'s forehead.
0:34:47|0:34:50|Upon learning that her baby is safe and sound, [Sang Er] holds [Cui Jie]'s hand and cries, expressing relief.
0:34:50|0:35:9|On the other side, [Zheng Hanshou] brought [Sang Er]'s father to the door of the mayor's mansion-like house. The two saw the mayor's wife walking by the fountain and quickly bowed with their hands together. Then [Zheng Hanshou] led [Sang Er]'s father into the hall, where there were staff preparing for the mayor's re-election everywhere. Passing by these people, [Zheng Hanshou] told [Sang Er]'s father that the mayor often mentioned him.
0:35:11|0:35:28|The latter indicated that there were some aggressive reports attacking the mayor's health outside, but in his opinion, it shouldn't be a big problem. Then the two walked through the lounge to a closed door. Before opening the door, [Zheng Hanshou] turned back and smiled at [Sang Er]'s father, then he grabbed the handle and slowly pushed the door open and walked in.
0:35:28|0:35:38|[Sang Er]'s father closely followed [Zheng Hanshou], then saw [Aziz] lying on the bed to the left of the door, unconscious with an oxygen mask on, realizing that his health was indeed as reported by the outside world.
0:36:10|0:36:12|Hope his son-in-law [Cui Jie] doesn't take things too seriously.
0:36:12|0:36:28|After saying that, [Zheng Hanshou] paused and glanced at [Sang Er]'s father behind him, indicating that she was about to become a grandfather, surely not wanting anything to happen to her loved ones. Then he completely turned around, winked at [Sang Er]'s father, patted his shoulder, and walked back into the house.
0:36:28|0:36:32|[Sang Er]'s father turned to look at [Zheng Hanshou] as he slowly walked away, then turned back to look at the document in his hand, lost in thought.
0:36:51|0:37:1|At this moment, a taxi driver, Li Zhongzhi, who was eating in his car, also saw the news on his phone, then checked his dashcam footage. The camera then switched to the entrance of the bar.
0:37:1|0:37:14|The prostitute [Xiao Man], with a swollen face, staggered over carrying a bag, recalling what happened after [A Bin] left. Can I have the money first? As soon as [Xiao Man] entered the room, she was pulled over by [A Bin], who then punched her in the left eye.
0:37:14|0:37:35|He pushed her onto the bed, she struggled to get up but was pressed down by him, her hands were handcuffed behind her back, then [A Bin] used a belt to gag her mouth, fastening the belt securely behind her head, and occasionally slapped her buttocks with his hand. When everything was over, [A Bin] even stood with his legs apart next to her head and urinated on her face.
0:37:35|0:37:55|Sad [Xiao Man] suddenly saw that [Li Zhongzhi] was still searching for [Yongzhi] on the street. After hearing from a passerby that they hadn't seen her, [Li Zhongzhi] thanked the person and then asked a woman selling snacks nearby. The woman selling snacks also said she hadn't seen her. Seeing [Li Zhongzhi] so persistent, [Xiao Man] pursed her lips in grievance, then caught up with him and said,
0:37:57|0:38:20|[Li Zhongzhi] immediately turned around and saw the anxious [Xiao Man]. Upon hearing about money, [Li Zhongzhi] glanced at her sideways, then turned back and continued walking forward. [Xiao Man] caught up with him, but [Li Zhongzhi] still didn't look back. She followed him all the way to the utility pole, where a startled [Xiao Man] leaned against it, gasping for breath. Meanwhile, [Li Zhongzhi] left with a look of anger on his face.
0:38:20|0:38:43|Watching the figure leaving in front of her, [Xiao Man] slowly lowered her head, then suddenly covered her chest and bent over because her body had not fully recovered from the torment by [A Bin] earlier. Leaning against the utility pole for a while, [Xiao Man] straightened up again, furrowed her brows, gasped for breath, and started crying softly. At this moment, [Li Zhongzhi] turned back and walked slowly towards [Xiao Man], who gasped again upon seeing him.
0:38:43|0:38:51|Then [Li Zhongzhi] walked up to her and said, staring firmly at [Xiao Man] leaning against the utility pole.
0:38:59|0:39:7|Xiao Man was sitting in the back of the truck hugging a customer, and happened to be facing A Bin, who was dragging Yongzhi away, so she saw the whole kidnapping process clearly.
0:39:9|0:39:13|Upon hearing this, [Li Zhongzhi] quickly stepped forward and asked [Xiao Man] seriously, who just choked back tears and smiled at him.
0:39:15|0:39:24|The next morning, [Li Zhongzhi] arrived at an intersection. Standing at the intersection, he had his hands in his pockets, furrowing his brow. Then, after seeing something, he took a step forward and walked towards it.
0:39:24|0:39:30|At this moment, a car turned out from the police station, and [Li Zhongzhi] raised his hand to stop the car, approaching to inquire.
0:39:32|0:39:46|The person driving the car is [A Bin], he smiled at the front passenger and gestured for him to sit in the front seat. [Li Zhongzhi] handed his phone to [A Bin], which had a map on it. After looking at it, [A Bin] turned to [Li Zhongzhi] and asked,
0:39:49|0:40:10|On the other side, [Cui Jie], who was still in the hospital, took out his laptop and browsed the internal network of the police station. There were dashcam videos uploaded by citizens after hearing the missing person notice. He opened one of them and found a scene where one person was dragging another person to the trunk by the seaside. As the faces became clearer in the video, the computer suddenly prompted that the video no longer existed.
0:40:10|0:40:20|After pressing twice with no response, [Cui Jie] picked up the computer and left the hospital. The camera then switched to [A Bin]'s car arriving at the location on the map. After pulling the handbrake, he said:
0:40:20|0:40:27|Then he glanced at [Li Zhongzhi], quickly turned back to the steering wheel in his hand, which ignored him and turned to look at the sea on the other side.
0:40:32|0:40:53|Someone told me that my daughter was taken away here. After hearing this, [Li Zhongzhi] slowly turned his head and stared motionlessly at [A Bin], who suggested to him. At this moment, [A Bin]'s facial expression looked very gentle, behaving like a normal police officer. However, [Li Zhongzhi]'s intense gaze made people feel uneasy. Unable to bear this kind of scrutiny, [A Bin] turned his head, only to find [Li Zhongzhi] still staring at him.
0:40:54|0:41:8|[A Bin] asked again with concern, [Li Zhongzhi] still staring at him intently. He then exhaled, causing [A Bin] to blink and, seeing that [Li Zhongzhi] still didn't get out of the car or speak, he touched the steering wheel, rubbed it twice, and avoided the latter's direct gaze.
0:41:9|0:41:33|After waiting for a while and realizing that the other party was still staring at him intently, [A Bin] straightened up and couldn't help but speak up. However, even so, [Li Zhongzhi] still didn't answer, continuing to stare at him with his eyes fixed. Finally, under [Li Zhongzhi]'s prolonged silence, [A Bin] couldn't resist anymore and blurted out. After speaking, he realized something was wrong and quickly turned his head to look ahead. At this moment, [Xiao Man] limped over from the side of the road to the front of the car. Immediately, [A Bin] turned back and shouted, about to fasten [Li Zhongzhi]'s seatbelt buckle.
0:41:35|0:41:45|Before they even made contact, the latter was pushed towards the car window by the former. Then, Li Zhongzhi wrapped the seatbelt around A Bin's neck, making him lean against his own legs, and then fiercely struck his temple with his elbow.
0:41:46|0:41:57|On the other side, [Cui Jie] hurriedly walked into the police station's tech room with a computer in hand, pulled up a chair next to the tech personnel, and asked why the video she had just watched was showing as non-existent after opening the computer.
0:42:10|0:42:27|The technicians quickly found the information as promised, so [Cui Jie] rushed out to his car with the address in hand. He opened the car door, placed the computer inside, and was about to leave when the car suddenly wouldn't start. In a panic, he pounded on the steering wheel. At that moment, [Aziz] drove up in his car from the outside. [Cui Jie] quickly got out of his car and stood in front of the vehicle, clasping his hands together in a plea for help.
0:42:27|0:42:40|Driving with [Cui Jie], [Adel] turned the car into a narrow alley after hearing the former say to turn left at the intersection. The car slowly came to a stop, and [Cui Jie] got out of the car, apologized to [Adel], and then walked deeper into the alley.
0:42:42|0:43:6|Looking around at the tall residential buildings according to the address provided by the technicians, at this moment, three men came up from the corridor of the building. After stopping in front of door 57, the foreign man with a big beard who had already traded with [Zheng Hanshou] at the pork processing plant knocked on the door. Outside the box, [Ad] helped [Cui Jie] get out of the car and reversed it. Suddenly, the car stalled, so he had to stop, get out of the car, and open the hood to fix it.
0:43:7|0:43:26|On the other side, [Cui Jie] continued to walk towards the depths of the alley. After passing by a fruit stall and a laundry shop, he arrived at the entrance of a 7-story residential building, Building 2. The door of unit 57 was open. The taxi driver from earlier asked the bearded foreign man if he needed anything, but the latter kicked him into the house, knocked over the computer, and demanded that he find the video he had previously uploaded to the police.
0:43:27|0:43:31|The driver, Li Zhongzhi, with blood coming out of his mouth, frantically searched through the boxes, whimpering in fear.
0:43:31|0:43:52|At this moment, [Cui Jie] walked up the stairs and turned into the hallway on this floor. He looked up at the door plates of each door. If he didn't find the right one, he would continue walking forward. After checking one by one, he suddenly saw a little bearded man behind a cabinet in front of him, chewing on corn. After looking at him, [Cui Jie] looked up and found that the door plate on the left of the cabinet was the address he was looking for.
0:43:52|0:44:10|He ignored the man with a small beard, turned around and walked to the door, knocked on it and asked if anyone was inside. The driver was copying the video and shouting for help. Then, [Cui Jie] immediately pulled out a gun from his waist, but the man with a small beard suddenly pushed a cabinet against his back. The door opened, and the man with long hair tightly hugged his neck and dragged him towards the window.
0:44:10|0:44:14|The bearded foreign man saw that the video was copied successfully, picked up a bottle of mineral water, and poured it on the power source.
0:44:43|0:45:7|Then he fiercely smashed towards the right arm of the man holding the gun, and then forcefully knocked the gun-holding hand against the glass. Seeing that the gun hadn't fallen, the bearded foreign man grabbed [Cui Jie]'s right hand and fiercely threw it out. The gun happened to fall in front of [Ad], who picked it up and looked up. At this moment, [Cui Jie] pushed off the wall and moved away from the window, pinning down the bearded man. The foreign man was heavily slammed on the table by an elbow strike to the waist, then got up and fiercely punched the armpit of the young bearded man.
0:45:7|0:45:27|Then he jumped up and used his knee to hit the opponent's throat, turned his head and hugged the man with long hair's neck and pressed down, lifted his knee heavily to hit his face, pulled him up and threw him towards the bearded foreign man. Subsequently, [Cui Jie] once again fought with the bearded man, their skills were evenly matched, exchanging punches and kicks. Outside the door, [Aziz] ran into the corridor holding a gun.
0:45:28|0:45:49|The bearded foreign man was punched by [Cui Jie] to the door, then hurriedly ran out sideways. As soon as he stepped out, he ran into [Aziz] holding a gun. The latter was about to shoot but had his magazine removed by him. Seeing this, [Ad] immediately kicked the bearded man away. Just as the foreign man was about to enter the door to help [Cui Jie] fight two other people, he heard [Cui Jie] say "catch him", and then [Ad] immediately ran towards the direction he was escaping and fired a shot.
0:45:49|0:46:5|Due to the clutter in the aisle, after [Ad] ran out of bullets without hitting him, the bearded foreign man hurried towards the stairs. Just as he was about to go down the stairs, he found that the gate was locked. After shaking it a few times without opening it, he was immediately caught up by [Ad].
0:46:5|0:46:18|In the chaos, the bearded foreign man stepped on the armrest and flipped into the aisle, trying to go to the rooftop from the outside stairs. Just as he stepped on the stairs, he was grabbed by the ankle from behind by [Adi], and then [Adi] kicked him in the chest with one hand on the ground.
0:46:18|0:46:24|[Cui Jie] lifted the legs of the man with a small beard and then threw him fiercely onto the man with long hair.
0:46:24|0:46:50|Two of them saw the boss running away, quickly got up and ran towards the door. Outside the door, three people were fighting, then they ran down the aisle together. On the other side, the bearded foreign man who was kicked ran to the flower bed on the rooftop, [Ade] picked up a flower pot and kicked it towards the former. After being kicked down, the former got up again and started fighting with [Ade]. By this time, the two men had already run down from the building, and then they stumbled into the vegetable market in the alleyway.
0:46:50|0:47:14|Two people entered the market and randomly scattered items on both sides to stop [Cui Jie] who was closely following behind. Despite the attempt, he couldn't shake him off. The man with a little monkey behind him pushed a cart and bumped into him, then turned and ran. However, [Cui Jie] directly crossed over the cart and kicked him to the ground with one foot. He then handcuffed his right hand and pushed down the man with long hair, handcuffing his left hand with the other. Inside the building, [Aziz] kept hitting the bearded foreign man's shoulders and waist with his elbows and wrists.
0:47:15|0:47:38|A group of curious boys gathered around as one of them, [Ad], jumped up and clamped his legs around the neck of the bearded foreign man. With a powerful twist of his waist, he slammed the man heavily to the ground. The man got up, grabbed a large parasol nearby, and wielded the sharp ribs of the umbrella to attack [Ad]. [Ad] quickly retreated, then braced himself with his left hand on the ground, executed a 360-degree flip, and viciously kicked towards the man's neck with his left leg.
0:47:38|0:48:1|Seeing the bearded foreign man still able to get up, [Adi] extended his right leg this time, kicking him directly into the resident's house behind him. The man, feeling dizzy, stood up and found [Adi], then clenched his teeth and threw a punch at him again, only to be kicked by [Adi] towards another resident's house. Seeing the bearded foreign man still struggling, [Adi] kicked him in the air twice in a row, finally kicking him out of the residential building onto the terrace.
0:48:1|0:48:20|The bearded foreign man, unwilling to give up, climbed up holding his chest and threw another punch at [Ade], only to be kicked towards the railing on the right by the latter. As he flew towards the railing on the left, it seemed like he was about to fall headfirst from the rooftop. In a hurry, [Ade] rushed forward and grabbed his waist, then with one hand holding his leg and the other hand pulling up his pants with force.
0:48:20|0:48:37|The bearded foreign man hanging upside down outside the building glanced at the scene below and urgently called for help from [Ad], who then reached out his right hand to him. The bearded foreign man quickly grabbed onto it, and the boys watching on the side cheered happily as they saw both of them on the balcony.
0:48:37|0:48:55|After the bearded foreign man was rescued, he gestured to [Adi] to handcuff him or loosen his collar. Suddenly, an accident occurred, and the bearded foreign man lifted a little boy behind him and threw him towards [Adi]. Seeing [Adi] catch the boy, the bearded foreign man lifted another boy and, despite [Adi] trying to stop him, he directly threw the boy in his hands out of the building.
0:48:57|0:49:20|[Ade] rushed over, leaped over the railing, grabbed the little boy and threw him back onto the rooftop. Then, gripping the edge of the rooftop with both hands, [Ade] managed to pull himself up after his right hand slipped. Just as he was about to jump over the railing onto the rooftop, he heard the bearded foreign man shouting "Go to hell!" and was then kicked in the chest, falling backwards.
0:49:20|0:49:32|During the fall, after hitting the elastic cable, he adjusted his direction and grabbed the TV antenna disc outside the building with both hands. However, the screws on the disc suddenly loosened, so Li Zhongzhi, who was holding onto him, accelerated towards the ground and flipped over, falling down.
0:49:38|0:49:47|Then he remembered how [Adel] had given him the bracelet for safety in the office before, but now the person who gave him the bracelet was lying on the cement floor with blood flowing from his head, unable to move for a long time.
0:50:1|0:50:22|Madam thanked [Zheng Hanshou] and then looked worriedly at [Aziz] again. In the hospital corridor, [Arno] reported to [Zheng Hanshou] that he had found the information they were looking for. Upon hearing this, the former said they would proceed with the surgery tonight. Meanwhile, in a run-down old building, [Li Zhongzhi] was on his knees, pushing against someone. The camera zoomed in as [Li Zhongzhi] panted heavily with sweat on his face and fresh blood on the back of his hand.
0:50:23|0:50:35|Exhausted, he suddenly knelt on the ground and forcefully smashed the iron wire mesh on the wall. Upon closer inspection, the person bound to the wire mesh was [A Bin], with his entire face completely covered in blood.
0:50:35|0:50:41|His left eye couldn't even open, he could only sit on the ground gasping for air carefully. At this moment, [Li Zhongzhi] approached him and asked,
0:50:43|0:50:49|The face of [A Bin], already swollen from the beating, blinked hard, blood trickling down his head onto his collar and chest.
0:50:49|0:50:59|Li Zhongzhi then took out his phone from his pocket and, with a pained expression, held up a photo of Li Yongzhi to Zheng Hanshou.
0:51:22|0:51:44|With empty eyes staring at the wire mesh, reminiscing about the childhood memories of [Li Yongzhi], he saw her smiling and waving at the camera. Then [Li Zhongzhi] lowered his head to look at the current photo of Yongzhi on his phone, made up his mind. Hearing a strange sound, [A Bin] widened his right eye and saw [Li Zhongzhi] dragging something over, frantically kicking the cement floor with his legs.
0:51:51|0:52:5|After tying up, Li Zhongzhi immediately picked up a large sledgehammer and swung it towards the direction where A Bin was sitting. Xiao Man was standing on the side, watching nervously on a gasoline drum. Li Zhongzhi hammered down one by one, hitting A Bin's head each time, until finally striking his chest.
0:52:12|0:52:16|He then put down the large sledgehammer and pulled his shirt down from his eyes.
0:52:21|0:52:36|After dispersing the crowd, the car drove towards the hospital. At this moment, a car sped past on the road. [A Bin], who was tied to the passenger seat, said to [Li Zhongzhi],
0:52:36|0:52:44|On the other side, [Zheng Hanshou] taped a girl's mouth and put her in the trunk. As he closed the door, his face was reflected on the transparent glass. It turned out to be Yongzhi.
0:52:44|0:53:3|Shortly after [Zheng Hanshou] took off his suit, opened the car door and sat in the driver's seat, fastened the seat belt, started the vehicle, [Li Zhongzhi] was sweating profusely, anxiously gripping the steering wheel and asking [A Bin]. By this time, [Zheng Hanshou] had already driven the car out, then turned into a small road in a field. He kept accelerating forward on the deserted street.
0:53:3|0:53:28|[Li Zhongzhi] was also anxiously revving the engine towards the direction of the cabin, wiping off the sweat that kept dripping down his face. In his haste to find Yongzhi, he ran a red light and collided head-on with a car driven by [Cui Jie]. The tires screeched against the ground as they spun wildly, but he managed to regain control of the vehicle. Yongzhi's phone, hidden in the back seat, accidentally slid out from under the carpet. At that moment, an ambulance rushed past the intersection, closely followed by [Cui Jie] driving Ad's car.
0:53:28|0:53:43|He observed a traffic accident at the intersection from the rearview mirror, then accelerated away. On one side, the two people whose cars collided had no intention of getting out of the car. [Zheng Hanshou] had Li Yongzhi, who was unconscious, in the trunk, while [Li Zhongzhi] had [A Bin] tied up with a rope in the passenger seat.
0:53:43|0:54:2|The latter, covered in blood and looking at the situation quite grimly, [Li Zhongzhi] sat in the driver's seat staring firmly in the direction of the rear of [Zheng Hanshou]'s car, gripping the steering wheel tightly and breathing heavily. On the other side, [Zheng Hanshou] saw [Li Zhongzhi], who had crashed into his car, still not getting out, also gripping the steering wheel anxiously. He then raised his left hand and pushed his glasses up.
0:54:2|0:54:20|Glancing at the left rearview mirror, [Li Zhongzhi] continued to grip the steering wheel with both hands. At this moment, he saw [A Bin] spitting out blood, just as he was about to take action, he suddenly heard the sound of a police car coming from his right front. The police car then stopped behind [Zheng Hanshou]'s vehicle, who took a deep breath at that moment, tightened his grip on the steering wheel, and then looked through the right rearview mirror.
0:54:20|0:54:23|Two police officers got out of the front of the police car, one on the left and one on the right.
0:54:23|0:54:40|Turning his head to look at the left rearview mirror again, [Li Zhongzhi] clenched the steering wheel, his eyes turning red. He saw two police officers about to walk over to the intersection to question him. He quickly reversed, turned around, and drove back. The police officers noticed he was trying to escape, so they shouted to stop him, then quickly got back into their police car and chased after him.
0:54:40|0:54:45|On the other side, seeing the police leave, [Zheng Hanshou] shrugged his shoulders and quickly started the vehicle to leave the intersection.
0:54:58|0:55:6|Li Zhongzhi is now hiding in the tall reeds with his car. He carefully starts the vehicle after seeing the police car drive away on the small road, and sets off towards the destination again.
0:55:6|0:55:15|Finally, the vehicle passed through a dense forest and turned into an open-air parking lot. [Li Zhongzhi] quickly hit the brakes, unbuckled his seatbelt, got out of the car, and walked towards [A Bin].
0:55:15|0:55:30|Seeing the latter already unconscious in the co-pilot seat, he forcefully pulled him down from the seat. And so, [A Bin] was tied behind his back, lying on the cement floor covered in blood. [Li Zhongzhi] kicked him in the chest and then in the stomach, venting his resentment.
0:55:30|0:55:56|He then turned his head and ran towards the small house in front of him. Inside the cluttered small house was a door. [Li Zhongzhi] quickly approached, pulled open the door, and walked in. Inside the door were two shabby shelves and a sofa. On the floor in front of the sofa was a rope, and looking down, [Li Zhongzhi] saw a pull ring attached to the rope. He pulled the ring hard, stepped on the wooden stairs below, and quickly went down to the bottom of the stairs. After seeing the scene around him, he was stunned.
0:55:56|0:56:17|In a space of less than ten square meters, there were many obviously used blankets on the floor. Seeing that there was no one here, he turned around and walked towards the stairs. Just as he stepped on a step, he saw the situation under his feet through the sunlight. The birthday gift he had given to [Li Yongzhi], the bracelet, appeared at the bottom of the handrail. [Li Zhongzhi] held it in his palm, tears in his eyes, stared at it for a while, then clenched his fist, quickly lifted his leg upstairs.
0:56:18|0:56:29|At this moment, a police car parked outside the door next to [Li Zhongzhi]'s car. The two police officers who got out of the front seat with their guns, found [A Bin] lying face up on the ground. They squatted down and shook his body.
0:56:34|0:56:54|Shouting loudly, [Li Zhongzhi] ordered the latter to raise his hands high. After [Li Zhongzhi] did so, one of the police officers turned his body and tried to handcuff him. However, [Li Zhongzhi] swiftly evaded the handcuffs, then quickly grabbed the gun pointing at him from another police officer and pushed him away. He then kicked the police officer holding the handcuffs into the bushes, immediately turned around and ran towards the reeds behind the cabin.
0:56:54|0:57:12|Two policemen quickly got up and raised their guns to chase after Li Zhongzhi, who was running in the direction. They ran through the reeds, and Li Zhongzhi arrived in a small forest full of tree trunks. He ran around the tree trunks, with the two policemen still closely following. At this moment, Li Zhongzhi once again disappeared into a dense reed bed.
0:57:15|0:57:19|The two police officers ran while pushing aside the branches of the surrounding reeds, then shouted loudly ahead to stop immediately, or they would open fire.
0:57:19|0:57:39|Seeing [Li Zhongzhi] ignoring the warning, the two police officers kept pulling the trigger forward, but all the shots hit the tree trunk beside him. Finally, he ran out of the reeds, and in front of [Li Zhongzhi] appeared a small river. He ran across the river on a tree trunk lying on the water. The two police officers behind also arrived at the riverbank, continuously shooting towards the other side, but the tree trunk on the water blocked their view.
0:57:39|0:58:3|Adding to that, [Li Zhongzhi] quickly ran up the hill and then swiftly turned to run towards the back slope. The two police officers could only watch as he ran away in the direction of the riverbank, slowly lowering their handguns. Meanwhile, [Li Zhongzhi] had already run far away from the woods. On the other side, [Cui Jie] sat on a chair outside the emergency room of the hospital, weakly pulling his hair. At this moment, a man in a suit walked up to him, taught him something, and [Cui Jie] quickly stood up and called him "Director", who turned out to be [Sang Er]'s father.
0:58:3|0:58:15|He hadn't had a chance to answer the other party about Ad's current situation when he heard the doctor open the door and walk out of the emergency room, saying that he had done his best. Due to the severe bleeding in Ad's brain, he had passed away. The family could start making arrangements.
0:58:16|0:58:39|After the doctor finished speaking, he turned and opened the door to the emergency room. [Cui Jie] couldn't accept the news, blinked and looked up at the ceiling, then turned and walked to the hospital wall, forcefully hitting it. With tears in his eyes and trembling body, a police officer walked up to the Director and said that colleagues had chased a hit-and-run vehicle, and found Officer [A Bin] unconscious next to the vehicle.
0:58:39|0:58:58|After the investigation, it was determined that the suspect came from Hong Kong. [Cui Jie], who was originally leaning against the wall with his arms, heard this news and immediately turned and walked out of the hospital. He then arrived at the cabin where [Li Zhongzhi] had previously posted the video, bending down to come down the stairs. [Cui Jie] turned his head to survey the cramped space, then squatted down to pick up something from the ground.
0:58:58|0:59:4|It turned out to be a shackle tied to a pillar. He looked down at the shackle for a moment, then put down the things and walked outside.
0:59:5|0:59:26|At this moment, three police officers are taking photos of the car driven by [Li Zhongzhi]. One of the officers approaches [Cui Jie] and informs him that a cellphone was found in the car. Cui Jie takes the phone, goes back to his own car to charge it, and unlocks the screen. On the screen is a selfie of [Li Yongzhi]. Meanwhile, [Zheng Hanshou] appears on the screen with a frown, surrounded by many blood-stained plastic clothes.
0:59:26|0:59:44|After pacing back and forth, he stopped and looked ahead, his lips slightly parted. In the next shot, [Li Zhongzhi] emerged from the reeds by the small path. By this time, the sun was slowly setting, the sky darkening. The path was deserted, so he quickened his pace, running towards the end of the path to continue searching for [Li Yongzhi].
0:59:53|1:0:10|At the door of Aziz's ward, despite hearing from colleagues that he had not woken up yet, Li Zhongzhi still turned the handle and walked to Aziz's bedside. There, he saw Aziz, with a bruised face and wearing an oxygen mask, lying unconscious. Cui Jie stood nearby with hands on hips, pacing anxiously. At that moment, the TV was reporting that a police officer had been severely beaten and was lying in the hospital for treatment.
1:0:25|1:0:30|After finding no useful information, he turned to the call records. [Li Zhongzhi] asked [Xiao Man] seriously,
1:0:40|1:0:46|After the call was disconnected, [Xiao Man] held her phone and dialed again, hearing the other party say hello. [Xiao Man] repeated the same words as before.
1:0:53|1:1:0|[Li Zhongzhi] held up the phone to [Xiao Man], who then picked up the phone and pressed the keys one by one. After connecting, there was no answer from the other party, so [Xiao Man] spoke first, saying that she needed a kidney.
1:1:4|1:1:10|A foreigner speaking English asked who made the introduction? Upon hearing this, [Li Zhongzhi] widened his eyes, [Xiao Man] looked up at him, and then told the person on the phone that it was introduced by [Aziz].
1:1:11|1:1:27|The person on the phone didn't speak and hung up directly. It turned out that the person who was speaking was the bearded foreign man. At this moment, [Xiao Man] raised her phone, and the name of this bearded foreign man was displayed on [Xiao Man]'s phone as xx.
1:1:27|1:1:47|After listening to Li Zhongzhi, he quickly flipped through Aziz's phone album, searched for a while, and then held it up to Xiao Man. She glanced at the phone, nodded at Li Zhongzhi, and in the photo, Aziz had a cigar in his left hand and his arm around Sha Cha's neck, looking very close. At this moment, a car with its headlights on slowly stopped downstairs at the hospital.
1:1:47|1:2:12|The back door opened and a man got off the car holding a briefcase in his left hand, who turned out to be the [Director]. After getting off the car, he turned to the back seat, where [Zheng Hanshou] was sitting, with his hands clasped together and smiling at him. After returning the gesture, he slowly closed the car door, then looked towards the hospital gate, paused for a moment, and walked slowly towards it. Turning into the corridor, the [Director] walked with the briefcase in his hands. At the end of the corridor were the guards [Aziz] and [Cui Jie].
1:2:12|1:2:27|The guard saw Director approaching and wanted to salute, but was gestured not to by the latter. Director walked lightly towards Cui Jie sitting on a chair, then sat down next to him with a file bag in hand. The sound of sitting down startled the dozing Cui Jie, who quickly straightened up, propping himself against the back of the chair.
1:2:45|1:2:53|The latter had a date with [Sang Er] tonight. Could it be that he forgot about it because he was here guarding [Aziz]? At this moment, [Cui Jie] just remembered that there was indeed such a thing and was about to say something.
1:2:53|1:3:7|Seeing the gaze from [Director], he smiled awkwardly, and the scene shifted back to the romantic restaurant. [Director] sat across from the couple, asking if they had chosen a name for their child. [Sang Er] smiled awkwardly at [Cui Jie] and replied that they hadn't decided yet.
1:3:7|1:3:19|Then [Director] took out a piece of paper from the pocket of his suit jacket, on which were written five names. He hoped they could refer to it later, but it was fine if they didn't like it. The couple could make their own decision. Looking carefully at the paper, [Sang Er] smiled at [Director].
1:3:36|1:3:47|Then he pulled [Cui Jie]'s arm to signal that he was going on stage to sing, and she looked at him tenderly. At this moment, a person wearing plastic gloves inserted a syringe into another person's arm. After the injection, the person in disheveled clothes who turned and left was none other than [A Bin].
1:4:8|1:4:18|Then Cui Jie's phone rang, he glanced at the caller ID, answered the call and put it to his ear. Across from him, the Director turned his head and squinted at Cui Jie. After hearing something, Cui Jie's left hand holding the phone dropped weakly.
1:5:11|1:5:30|In this country, everyone is at risk of disappearing at any time, including [Cui Jie]. After hearing this shocking news, she widened her eyes and leaned weakly against the back of the chair, then looked towards the direction of the [Director], who shook his head helplessly. Back at the hospital, [Zheng Hanshou] handed a file bag to the [Director] in the car. After opening it, the [Director] saw [Sha Cha]'s personal information. After carefully examining it, he heard [Zheng Hanshou] saying that he and his men were all dead.
1:6:21|1:6:37|Everyone followed his orders, [Cui Jie] snapped out of his daze only after hearing the command for everyone to obey. Then the Director recalled another order given to him by [Zheng Hanshou] in the car, to make [Li Zhongzhi] disappear once found. The Director looked at [Zheng Hanshou] smiling at him, and could only purse his lips and lower his head.
1:6:37|1:6:58|On the other side of the dark street, [Cui Jie] lit two candles and burned paper money. The camera zoomed in, revealing that this place was where [Ade] fell from. In the drizzle, [Cui Jie] prayed silently while burning the paper, holding the bracelet given to him by [Ade]. He squatted down, bowed his head, tightly squeezed the bracelet, and then left after the burning was complete. The scene shifted to a large car parked in the middle of a small alley next to the gatehouse.
1:6:58|1:7:18|Inside the car, all surveillance computers, [Cui Jie] sat next to the door and video-called with [Director] and colleagues. Meanwhile, [Sha Cha] rode a small motorcycle and stopped in front of the elevator at the pork processing plant. He then entered the plant, parked another electric bike in front of the control room, looked down at his phone, and walked into the control room, muttering a lyric, "I will embrace you tonight, I will meet you tonight."
1:7:21|1:7:30|Then, on the other side, fully armed police officers with masks sat down. They reported to [Cui Jie] that they were ready, and he pressed the microphone in the car, indicating to start the operation in 30 seconds, while checking his watch.
1:7:30|1:7:53|At this moment, [Li Zhongzhi] entered the frame and looked around. It turned out he had also arrived at the processing plant. [Cui Jie] saw this on the monitor and quickly called off the operation. The Director, through a video call, said to ignore it and told [Cui Jie] that [Li Zhongzhi] must also die. Seeing himself being ordered to obey, [Cui Jie] angrily closed the video call with a fierce look in his eyes, staring at [Li Zhongzhi] on the monitor. He lowered his head, feeling very confused. At this moment, [Li Zhongzhi] arrived at the gate of the pork processing plant.
1:7:53|1:8:9|After looking at the sign on the wall, [Li Zhongzhi] lifted the door curtain next to it and walked in. Frowning, he walked a short distance before turning into a corridor. On the right side of the corridor, there was a room. He walked slowly towards it, tried to pull the door but it didn't open. Then, he walked while tiptoeing and looked inside through the glass on the door.
1:8:9|1:8:28|At this moment, someone heard a voice asking [Li Zhongzhi] what he was up to. Li replied that he was looking for the restroom but was refused. He then grabbed the person's elbow and twisted it fiercely, pulled him towards his right fist and smashed it into his nose. The person fell to the ground and Li kicked his face with his right foot. He then walked towards the deeper end of the corridor. Another person saw his fallen companion and wanted to go forward to teach [Li Zhongzhi] a lesson.
1:8:28|1:8:41|Li Zhongzhi was pushed against the wall by the latter, and at this moment, a door appeared in the depths of the corridor. Li Zhongzhi glanced at his opponent who had fainted, pulled the access card from his neck, and then walked step by step towards the direction of the door with the access card in hand.
1:8:41|1:9:1|Arriving at the door, [Li Zhongzhi] lowered his head and swiped the access card. At this moment, [Sha Cha] casually glanced at the surveillance and noticed [Li Zhongzhi] walking towards the processing plant. Passing by an intersection, a man leaning against the wall playing with his phone noticed [Li Zhongzhi] and shouted at him. [Li Zhongzhi] turned around and threw a punch at the man, then followed up with a flurry of punches to his face. The man fell to the ground, face up, after being hit repeatedly. Watching the whole process through the surveillance, [Sha Cha] exclaimed how formidable [Li Zhongzhi] was.
1:9:5|1:9:13|Hearing the voice, [Li Zhongzhi] turned around to see a man with a walkie-talkie attached to his pants. Then [Li Zhongzhi] looked up towards the camera, walked over to the man, pulled off the walkie-talkie, and pressed the button to ask [Sha Cha] where [Li Yongzhi] was. [Sha Cha] responded.
1:9:16|1:9:25|It's a game to play with Li Zhongzhi. If the latter can find himself, then let Li Zhongzhi see his daughter. Then Sha Cha said he was on the right side, just walk over to Li Zhongzhi.
1:9:25|1:9:36|Putting down the walkie-talkie from his mouth, [Li Zhongzhi] passed through a glass room full of thugs. The thugs inside the room heard [Sha Cha] saying through the walkie-talkie that they must catch [Li Zhongzhi], then turned around and all rushed towards [Li Zhongzhi]'s direction.
1:9:36|1:9:48|The first person who ran towards [Li Zhongzhi] was about to throw a punch but was dodged by the latter and hit in the face. The second person kicked towards [Li Zhongzhi]'s stomach, but he grabbed the leg and pressed it to the ground, then jumped up and stomped on the opponent's legs spread apart.
1:9:48|1:10:8|At this moment, the third person approached [Li Zhongzhi], who struck him in the neck with a punch. Seeing his companion fall to the ground, the fourth person also ran over. Before he could land a punch on [Li Zhongzhi], he was hit in the temple and fell to the ground. After dealing with the people, [Li Zhongzhi] observed his surroundings and walked forward, lifting another curtain. [Li Zhongzhi] entered the freight corridor of the processing plant, where many people holding knives appeared ahead.
1:10:8|1:10:14|[Li Zhongzhi] walked towards the fifth person, who was holding a machete and swung it at him. Li Zhongzhi countered with a shoulder throw and then stabbed the knife into him.
1:10:14|1:10:33|The sixth person shouted and ran towards [Li Zhongzhi]. He bent down to dodge the machete, then grabbed the person's leg and pulled him down. He dodged the seventh person, slid on the ground and kicked down the eighth person. He grabbed the ninth person's leg, flipped him over and broke it. When he saw the seventh person pouncing again, [Li Zhongzhi] smashed his temple with his elbow, then turned around and kicked the eighth person in the chest, sending him flying out.
1:10:33|1:10:52|Then he saw another curtain in the corridor, so he lifted it and walked in. It was the pork cold storage room, where two men with machetes were waiting at the door. Seeing the two men charging towards him, [Li Zhongzhi] quickly hid behind a row of pork. He first knocked out the tenth man who came after him with two punches, then flipped him over and pinned him to the ground. After securing one hand, he kicked towards his head with his foot.
1:10:52|1:11:8|Bu then grabbed the machete and slid towards the eleventh person standing on the table. After the person fell down, Bu used the knife to fiercely hit his temple. With that, the person was taken care of. [Li Zhongzhi] walked out of the cold storage room filled with pigs, holding the machete, and entered the assembly line workshop. Looking around, [Li Zhongzhi] picked up the walkie-talkie hanging on his waist and pressed the button to ask where [Sha Cha] was.
1:11:10|1:11:28|In the control room, [Li Zhongzhi] saw that [Sha Cha] had actually come to his right front. [Sha Cha] walked out of the control room and shouted at [Li Zhongzhi] as if he were a wild boar. Then he stared at [Li Zhongzhi] and even imitated the sound of a wild boar. Seeing [Sha Cha] in person, [Li Zhongzhi] put down the walkie-talkie in his hand and slowly turned to face him. The latter ordered his three henchmen behind him, who were holding machetes, to cut [Li Zhongzhi] into.
1:11:30|1:11:40|In two halves, [Li Yongzhi] shouted and asked where [Yongzhi] was, then smashed the walkie-talkie to the side. Three people on this side ran over with machetes, one wearing a jacket, one wearing a shirt, and one wearing a hat, their skills completely different from the previous ones.
1:11:40|1:11:57|They took turns swinging knives in the workshop, forcing [Li Zhongzhi] to step back. With both hands holding a machete, he blocked the man in the cap's attack. [Li Zhongzhi] quickly moved around a cement pillar, but the man in the cap blocked his way, slashing at him. Two others joined the fight, pushing [Li Zhongzhi] to the side of the station control panel.
1:11:57|1:12:11|The man in the cap took the opportunity to raise the knife and slash at his right arm. After being cut, [Li Zhongzhi] quickly kicked off the ground and flipped over from the knife-wielding platform. The man in the cap grabbed another iron rod and chased after him. [Niu Jieshi] inserted the machete into the pillar next to [Li Zhongzhi]'s head, who immediately grabbed his right hand and threw him out with a somersault.
1:12:11|1:12:23|On the other side, a small car quickly pulled up from the dark alley. The door opened, and [Director] frowned as he got out of the car. He then yanked open the door of the commanding car, pointed at [Cui Jie], and asked what he was up to. He then walked over to Ma Feng and said he was Director Cai.
1:12:32|1:12:52|After receiving a positive response, [Cui Jie] punched Director Cai in the right eye, then kicked open the door of the command vehicle and ran towards the pig processing plant. Director Cai sat on a stool, sighed, and pressed his forehead. Inside the processing plant, Hat Man and Shirt Man stood one after the other in the direction of [Li Zhongzhi]. After catching his breath, Shirt Man once again rushed towards him with a machete. [Li Zhongzhi] quickly engaged in a struggle with him, blocking the arm wielding the knife aimed at his abdomen.
1:12:52|1:12:58|He locked the man's arms with both hands and pushed him backwards, then kicked him to the ground with force.
1:13:0|1:13:4|At this moment, the man in the hat and the man in the hat shirt slashed from the side, coordinating with each other. The latter jumped up and cut Li Zhongzhi's left thigh.
1:13:4|1:13:9|The man in the shirt kicked him to the ground after joining, and [Li Zhongzhi] was cut on the left chest by the man in the hat after getting up.
1:13:9|1:13:23|At this moment, [Sha Cha] was singing while driving his electric bike, passing by on the right side of [Li Zhongzhi]. Then the three people on the opposite side continued to attack [Li Zhongzhi], slashing him twice on the waist and back. He then lay on the conveyor belt, using his hands and feet to attack the three people before flipping over and standing on the ground.
1:13:23|1:13:38|The man in the hat, upon seeing this, lifted his leg high from the right and kicked [Li Zhongzhi] in the left face. He was directly kicked flying onto another operating table. [Sha Cha] leisurely picked up a curved hook with an electric car, aimed at the kneeling [Li Zhongzhi] on the operating table, and swung it over. The hook firmly pierced into the latter's calf, then [Sha Cha] pulled hard, and [Li Zhongzhi] fell to the ground.
1:13:41|1:13:47|At this moment, [Sha Cha] accelerated and dragged [Li Zhongzhi] through the factory, passing by a cement pillar. The latter hurriedly grabbed onto it, trying to stop.
1:13:47|1:13:58|Seeing this, [Sha Cha] accelerated fiercely, the tires rubbing against the ground at high speed, causing smoke to rise. The blood from [Li Zhongzhi]'s calf kept flowing as a result of the confrontation. After accelerating once again, [Li Zhongzhi] finally let go due to the pain.
1:13:58|1:14:10|At this moment, [Cui Jie] burst in with a gun, only to find [Sha Cha] dragging [Li Zhongzhi]. He quickly fired several shots towards [Sha Cha] and then swiftly flipped over the control panel to shoot at the other three henchmen. [Sha Cha] hurriedly abandoned the electric bike and took cover behind a cement pillar.
1:14:10|1:14:22|At this moment, [Cui Jie] hurriedly arrived by [Li Zhongzhi]'s side, helped him sit up, and dragged him to lean against a wall. Seeing the curved hook on Li Zhongzhi's leg, she wanted to remove it, but was quickly stopped by him.
1:14:22|1:14:43|At this moment in the command vehicle, [Director] pressed the microphone to notify the team to act immediately. Soon, many armed police officers wearing masks came running from all directions of the alley. The man with the hat in the pork processing plant was slowly approaching [Li Zhongzhi] with a machete. [Cui Jie] finally pulled out the grappling hook, and as the man with the hat heard the sound and raised his knife to strike, he quickly picked up the gun and shot him in the chest.
1:14:45|1:14:53|The man in the cap then approached [Cui Jie], who took the knife from [Li Zhongzhi] and confronted him, kicking him over with one foot. The man in the shirt then flipped over the operating table and ran over.
1:15:7|1:15:24|Then [Sha Cha] turned over the operating table, roaring towards [Cui Jie], who picked up a machete to meet him. The two machetes and kitchen knives clashed in the air continuously as they circled each other. Seizing an opportunity, [Cui Jie] slashed [Sha Cha]'s chest. Gritting his teeth, [Sha Cha] exerted force and saw [Cui Jie] turn around and slash his back.
1:15:24|1:15:37|The two gasping individuals stared at each other, then [Sha Cha] once again swung at [Cui Jie], scratching his chest. After [Cui Jie] scratched [Sha Cha]'s arm, he knocked off the latter's hat, then grabbed one of his hands and knocked a cleaver out of it.
1:15:37|1:16:2|[Sha Cha] quickly grabbed [Cui Jie]'s shoulder, turned him around with his head, and then raised the cleaver to chop down. The latter dodged with a strong flip and kicked [Sha Cha] away. As [Sha Cha] got up, he kicked towards [Cui Jie]'s chest, and then the two fought again. At this moment, something broke the glass of the workshop and was thrown in - it turned out to be tear gas. Soon, under the effect of tear gas, the entire factory was slowly covered by thick smoke. [Cui Jie] and [Sha Cha] continued to fight fiercely.
1:16:3|1:16:12|On the other side, the police officers walked in from the corridor with infrared beams, shooting directly when they saw someone. Meanwhile, inside the workshop, tear gas canisters were still being thrown in.
1:16:12|1:16:18|[Li Zhongzhi] covered his mouth and nose with one hand, and tried to stand up by holding onto the railing with the other. In the aisle, the police continued to shoot at anyone they saw.
1:16:18|1:16:36|Continuing after dealing with one opponent, [Li Zhongzhi] proceeds towards the interior of the factory. In the other aisle, the henchmen knocked down by him struggle on the ground, covering their mouths and noses. In the workshop, [Cui Jie] and [Sha Cha] have to stop fighting due to tear gas, coughing uncontrollably. At this moment, the police have already turned into the goods passage, while [Li Zhongzhi] looks towards the fighting [Cui Jie] with his mouth and nose covered.
1:16:36|1:16:57|Earlier, the henchmen who were knocked down by [Li Zhongzhi] helped each other into the pork cold storage room. During the fight between [Cui Jie] and [Sha Cha], the henchmen entered the workshop one after another through the cold storage room. At this time, the police who had already chased to the door of the cold storage room saw someone ahead firing again. Subsequently, a large number of police officers rushed into the workshop and opened fire at anyone standing, causing the henchmen who had just run in to fall to the ground instantly.
1:16:57|1:17:14|Facing away from the door, [Sha Cha] was also hit in the shoulder. Then another wave of police officers stopped at the door, continuing to shoot inside. The man in the cap sitting on the ground hadn't had time to run yet and was shot in the chest by stray bullets. His henchman hiding behind a cement pillar wanted to find another place to hide, but was shot in the back after running a few steps. Seeing this, another henchman also wanted to escape.
1:17:14|1:17:30|Having been hit in the shoulder as well, with the people at the door almost cleared out, the police entered the workshop and continued shooting underground. A shot accidentally hit the railing next to Li Zhongzhi's head, causing him to quickly lie down on the ground. Cui Jie noticed this and quickly flipped over to Li Zhongzhi's side, lifting one of his arms and placing him on his shoulder.
1:17:30|1:17:43|Struggling to move forward, the police kept firing their guns. [Cui Jie] quickly helped [Li Zhongzhi] to move inside, opened a door and left the workshop. As the door was about to close, a hand from inside gently grabbed the handle and closed it.
1:17:43|1:17:50|At this moment, the police in the workshop no longer attack as fiercely as before, but cautiously grope around, occasionally kicking the people lying on the ground with their feet.
1:17:50|1:18:4|Inside the door, [Cui Jie] supported [Li Zhongzhi] as he opened the door curtain and walked in unsteadily. After placing the latter on a swivel chair, he kept coughing. [Li Zhongzhi], who was sitting with his head down on the swivel chair, slowly looked around and noticed medicine bottles and bloodstains everywhere. Gasping for breath, [Cui Jie] said, "They came here."
1:18:5|1:18:12|Even if it means destroying this place, I will take your life. [Li Zhongzhi] is sweating profusely as he sways and leans on the swivel chair, observing.
1:18:14|1:18:17|After catching his breath, [Li Zhongzhi] heard [Cui Jie] say to him,
1:18:36|1:18:45|After turning his head, Li Zhongzhi shook vigorously, squinted his eyes, trembled his lips, then swallowed hard and said softly.
1:18:46|1:19:4|[Li Zhongzhi] shook his head again, gasping for breath, then looked at the plastic door curtain in front of him stained with blood. He took a step forward and fell to the ground. Upon hearing this, [Cui Jie] immediately turned around to help him, but [Li Zhongzhi] pushed him away. He then propped his elbow on the swivel chair and slowly lifted his upper body onto the seat.
1:20:37|1:20:55|Then both sides continued to strike with their fists, [Cui Jie] hit [Sha Cha]'s arm in one attack, then struck the latter's temple with one hand and kicked him onto a small treatment cart. The cart was knocked over and an oxygen tank and a large pack of cotton swabs fell out from inside. [Cui Jie] approached [Sha Cha] from above, trying to pull him up, but suddenly the latter picked up the oxygen tank and viciously smashed it down.
1:20:55|1:20:56|Add to the temples.
1:20:56|1:21:18|Then [Sha Cha] sprayed towards [Cui Jie]'s face, the latter was hit on the temple again, falling to the ground. [Sha Cha] also knelt on the ground due to exhaustion. Both of them unconsciously spat at each other, lacking the strength to continue fighting. Seeing this, [Sha Cha] relaxed and lay down in front of the large freezer. [Li Zhongzhi] was opening the doors of the freezers one by one, finding several empty ones. Finally, he pulled open one freezer door and inside,
1:21:18|1:21:40|Li Zhongzhi finally found something inside, so he pulled the cart tray below and slowly moved it out. On the tray was a piece of cloth dipped in blood. Li Zhongzhi lowered his head to look at the cloth, slowly lowered his right hand from the freezer door, then tightly held the cloth on both sides and slowly lifted it open. Underneath revealed black short hair and a pair of eyebrows. At this moment, Li Zhongzhi's sweat gathered on his chin and dripped down.
1:21:40|1:22:2|Then he widened his bloodshot eyes, his eyeballs swaying from side to side. Tears rolled down from the sides of his cheeks. He lowered his head to look towards his left front, his lips trembling as he opened his mouth. He then shifted his gaze downwards, slowly moving the white cloth to his neck. The person's face was pale, with many bloodstains on the cheeks. Seeing this, [Li Zhongzhi]'s mouth trembled violently.
1:22:2|1:22:11|Tears, snot, and sweat then flowed down his cheeks, and after gritting his teeth, he opened his mouth wide, closed his eyes, and roared at the ceiling.
1:22:11|1:22:30|At this moment, from the side, the person lying on the tray was finally seen clearly. He was [Li Zhongzhi]'s daughter [Li Yongzhi]. After roaring towards the sky for several times, [Li Zhongzhi] turned his gaze back to [Li Yongzhi]'s face. His saliva mixed with tears kept dripping on the ground. Then he slowly closed his eyes, sniffed, and swallowed a few mouthfuls of saliva.
1:22:30|1:22:54|With his hand on [Li Yongzhi]'s neck, [Li Zhongzhi] slowly leaned his forehead against hers. As he cried, he unconsciously rubbed his cheek against [Li Yongzhi]'s hair. Then he kept shaking his head, as if unwilling to believe that his precious daughter was lying there. Finally, he swallowed hard and said in a low voice,
1:22:55|1:23:0|Li Zhongzhi's forehead slowly left Li Yongzhi's, then he released his hands and knelt weakly on the ground.
1:23:0|1:23:9|For days, Li Zhongzhi had not shaved in his search for his daughter. His face, now wet with sweat and tears, he looked helplessly at the ground, breathing heavily, trying to calm his emotions.
1:23:9|1:23:35|The cold air in the freezer kept rushing towards [Li Zhongzhi]. He slowly lifted his head to look at the bottom of the tray, then tilted his head back to gaze up at the top of [Li Yongzhi]'s head. After taking a deep breath, he slowly raised his right hand to grab the tray, then placed his left hand on it, pulling himself up from the ground. As he stood up bent over, [Li Zhongzhi] kept staring at [Li Yongzhi]'s face, tears continuously dripping from his cheeks. His lips trembled unconsciously, then he slowly raised his hands and placed them on [Li Yongzhi]'s face.
1:23:36|1:23:50|[Li Zhongzhi] carefully wiped away the still wet bloodstains on [Li Yongzhi]'s face, touched her cheek, then placed his hands on her head, slowly smoothing her messy short hair behind her ears. After finishing, [Li Zhongzhi] looked at [Li Yongzhi], then withdrew his right hand and took something out of his pocket.
1:23:50|1:23:56|To the left of Li Yongzhi, who was digging as he walked, he gently took out the left wrist of the latter from the pocket.
1:23:56|1:24:14|Originally in Li Zhongzhi's pocket was the bracelet he had previously given to Li Yongzhi. Carefully, he rewrapped the bracelet around her wrist, but due to his trembling hands, he couldn't fasten the clasp. Finally, Li Zhongzhi hung the bracelet on Li Yongzhi's wrist, then he picked up her small hand and placed it near his lips.
1:24:14|1:24:24|He swallowed his saliva lightly, sniffed, then looked again at the lying Li Yongzhi. He closed his eyes tightly, gritted his teeth, shook his head, and slowly put Li Yongzhi's left hand back.
1:24:24|1:24:48|Li Zhongzhi took a few deep breaths, tears, snot, and sweat mixed together once again, dripping down. He gritted his teeth, trembling chin fiercely opened his eyes, staring at Li Yongzhi. He swallowed hard, then in the corridor outside, Cui Jie was still lying on the ground motionless. Sha Cha picked up a 20-centimeter long steel knife from the console and crawled towards Cui Jie. At this moment, Li Zhongzhi grabbed Sha Cha from behind and then with his left hand
1:24:48|1:25:11|His right wrist holding the knife, his right hand pulling the opponent's arm, dragging it backwards while aligning the sharp blade of the knife with [Sha Cha]'s neck. [Cui Jie] could only lie on the ground watching [Li Zhongzhi] exerting force, as [Sha Cha] tried to pull [Li Zhongzhi]'s hands to move the blade away from his neck. Seeing the opponent almost breaking free, [Li Zhongzhi] suddenly lowered his head and fiercely bit down on [Sha Cha]'s right ear. The latter, due to the sudden pain, kept kicking the ground with both feet.
1:25:11|1:25:24|Li Zhongzhi then turned his whole body forcefully to the right, the blade piercing Sha Cha's neck. Blood sprayed onto Li Zhongzhi's left wrist like a fountain, then he exerted force again, throwing Sha Cha directly to the ground, the steel knife also flung out.
1:25:24|1:25:33|[Sha Cha] died, [Li Zhongzhi] sat leaning against the console, gasping for breath, blood trickling from his mouth, but he just stared at the lifeless [Sha Cha].
1:25:33|1:25:47|At this moment, [Cui Jie] supported his upper body with both hands, glanced at [Li Zhongzhi] sitting down, then looked at [Sha Cha]. At the same time, Director Cai pursed his lips, furrowed his brow, and slowly walked in from the aisle wearing a bulletproof vest. His gaze was fixed on [Li Zhongzhi] beside him.
1:25:47|1:26:8|Then Director Cai aimed the gun at the latter's forehead. Seeing this, Cui Jie shouted while lying on the ground that they were the police. Director Cai turned to look at Cui Jie, narrowed his eyes, gently shook the gun, then turned back to see the defiant look in Li Zhongzhi's eyes. Director Cai took a deep breath, lowered the gun, and then looked back at Cui Jie lying on the ground, squinted his eyes, and took out a cellphone from his pants pocket.
1:26:8|1:26:37|After taking it out, he pressed the screen again, and then heard a woman's scream. Director Cai aimed the phone screen at Cui Jie, who immediately crawled over with all limbs and snatched the phone. After looking at it, Cui Jie suddenly started gasping for breath, then couldn't help but cry out. It turned out that inside was Sang Er, who was sitting in a hospital gown on a chair, with both hands tied to the chair and mouth tightly taped shut. Li Zhongzhi, sitting next to him, also saw this scene. Hearing Sang Er's continuous cries for help, he gasped and tightly closed his eyes.
1:26:37|1:26:46|After thinking for a moment, Li Zhongzhi furrowed his brow, swallowed hard, and turned his head to the side to speak.
1:26:47|1:27:5|Hearing this, [Cui Jie], who was crying, turned to look at [Li Zhongzhi]. He gasped and looked at [Li Zhongzhi] as if asking how to save the situation. At this moment, [Li Zhongzhi] opened his eyes. The scene shifted to a car driving with its headlights on in complete darkness. As the headlights illuminated the surroundings, the tall trees appeared, and an empty path lay ahead.
1:27:6|1:27:18|[Cui Jie] drove silently, with [Li Zhongzhi] sitting next to him staring out the window. Suddenly, [Li Zhongzhi] pursed his lips, pulled the handbrake of the car, and then handcuffed himself to the steering wheel using the handcuffs that were hanging on [Cui Jie]'s pants.
1:27:18|1:27:40|At the same time, [Li Zhongzhi] snatched the pistol carried by [Cui Jie], took a look at the latter, turned off the car lights and walked down, swaying and stumbling forward. He threw down the car keys and handcuff keys of [Cui Jie], stepped over the well-groomed lawn, and slowly walked towards the destination. At this moment, a palace-like house appeared, it turned out to be [Aziz]'s home. He was lying on a hospital bed inhaling oxygen. [Zheng Hanshou] was complaining about...
1:27:56|1:28:0|After the explanation, [Zheng Hanshou] said to [Aziz] that all he needed to do now was to rest well. Upon hearing this, the latter slowly closed his eyes and fell asleep.
1:28:0|1:28:13|A dark figure is slowly making its way through the high trees, and through the dim light ahead, it is discovered that the person limping and walking crookedly is [Li Zhongzhi]. Slowly, he walks onto a vast lawn, with warm light shining through the windows ahead.
1:28:13|1:28:38|Walking across the lawn, [Li Zhongzhi] arrived at the path outside the window. The warm light inside the window cast a serious look on his face. He looked inside and saw a birthday party going on, with a dozen people sitting around the dining table chatting. A group of children were running around the table, making the scene lively. [Li Zhongzhi], who was walking and looking around, turned his head back and walked forward blankly. On the floor next to the dining table, there were gift boxes piled half a person high, and the cameras and flashes kept flickering.
1:28:38|1:28:44|The children happily ran and jumped with lollipops in their hands, while outside the house, [Li Zhongzhi] gritted his teeth, took out a gun from his pocket, and continued to walk forward in a crooked manner.
1:28:47|1:29:8|Then the camera cuts back to the room, where the photographer is taking a family photo of four people, while another person is filming three kids playing. Finally, Li Zhongzhi, who was walking forward absentmindedly, crosses the restaurant and stops by a tree with lights. From there, he sees Zheng Hanshou's figure through the window. The latter gives some instructions to the standing nurse and then heads towards the restaurant.
1:29:8|1:29:13|After watching the direction the nurse left and then looking at [Zheng Hanshou], [Li Zhongzhi] gritted his teeth and continued to walk forward.
1:29:14|1:29:34|At this moment, [Zheng Hanshou] has arrived at the entrance of the restaurant. The restaurant is filled with cute balloons. After another round of photos, there was a warm round of applause inside the room. The applause passed through the window and reached the ears of [Li Zhongzhi] outside. He slowly stopped in his tracks, turned his head towards the house, then his eyes shifted to the left front, pursed his lips, and took slow steps forward.
1:29:34|1:29:41|On the other side of the screen, the scene returns to the restaurant, with [Zheng Hanshou] squatting next to a little girl in a skirt, wishing her a happy birthday, Jiajia.
1:29:46|1:30:9|Then he picked up the lollipop on the table and handed it over. Jiajia was about to pick it up but was told by the latter that she had to smile before she could have it. So Jiajia had to grin before she could get the lollipop from [Zheng Hanshou]. After grinning, she quickly lowered her head. Outside the house, [Li Zhongzhi] climbed the steps, tried to pull a door behind which he couldn't open, then he continued to walk towards the front door in a crooked manner. When he reached the door, he paused for a moment, then tried to pull the door with his left hand.
1:30:9|1:30:32|The door unexpectedly opened, the movement of the door caused the curtains to sway. Then [Li Zhongzhi] stepped into the room. The nurse who was just sitting next to [Aziz] taking care of him saw [Li Zhongzhi] and took a deep breath. The latter then locked her in the compartment. At this moment, [Zheng Hanshou] had his back to the restaurant door, and [Li Zhongzhi] happened to walk past from the opposite side. The former turned around to look, but didn't notice anything unusual, then turned back to the restaurant and smiled at everyone.
1:30:33|1:30:57|At this moment, [Aziz] was quietly sleeping on the hospital bed while inhaling oxygen. A family photo was placed on the table next to him. Seeing this, [Li Zhongzhi] walked over in a crooked manner and stood by [Aziz]. He stared fixedly at the position on Aziz's chest, then placed the hand holding the gun on the edge of the bed. Slowly bending down, he pressed his right ear against Aziz's chest, hearing the sound of his heartbeat through the thick blanket.
1:30:58|1:31:18|With each heartbeat he heard, his eyeballs would twitch, [Li Zhongzhi] leaned against [Aziz]'s chest in an almost trance-like state, listening to the strong heartbeat. He couldn't help but shed tears, tears gradually welled up at the corners of his eyes, and then the head pressed against [Aziz]'s chest began to tremble continuously. Finally, tears fell from the corners of [Li Zhongzhi]'s eyes.
1:31:18|1:31:30|He gasped against [Aziz]'s chest, hearing the heartbeat getting louder. He could no longer control his emotions, furrowing his brows, flaring his nostrils, trembling lips slowly closing his eyes, as if he could still feel [Li Yongzhi] in this world.
1:31:30|1:31:39|And greeted himself. Upon hearing the sound, [Li Zhongzhi] instantly opened his eyes and saw [Zheng Hanshou] standing by the door.
1:31:40|1:31:58|At this moment, [Li Zhongzhi] stared fiercely, slowly moved his right ear away from [Aziz]'s chest, stood up straight, took a deep breath, held a gun, and walked step by step towards [Zheng Hanshou]. As he approached, [Li Zhongzhi] slowly walked from the door towards the room. Then, with tears in his eyes, [Li Zhongzhi] asked [Zheng Hanshou] a serious question.
1:32:6|1:32:12|In the meantime, [Li Zhongzhi] had already stood at the door, while [Zheng Hanshou] came to the right front of [Aziz] and stared straight at [Li Zhongzhi].
1:32:18|1:32:24|Hearing [Zheng Hanshou] compare the issue to a natural disaster, [Li Zhongzhi] gritted his teeth and then listened further.
1:32:27|1:32:45|[Zheng Hanshou] explained with red eyes, [Li Zhongzhi] first sniffed, then gritted his teeth, turned around and didn't want to look at [Zheng Hanshou] again. Suddenly, he saw a group of people walking from the restaurant through the door. It turned out to be Jiajia holding a birthday cake and a whole bunch of people walking towards this room.
1:32:46|1:33:9|Shortly after [Li Zhongzhi] cleared his throat and glanced at [Zheng Hanshou], he slowly moved towards the door. Arriving at the door, he saw a large family had already walked out of the restaurant across the street and was walking towards this side. Jiajia was at the front of the line, holding a cake and smiling happily. [Li Zhongzhi] used his left hand to slowly close the door.
1:33:12|1:33:36|The door was completely closed by him, then [Zheng Hanshou] nodded at him, and [Li Zhongzhi] turned around, raised his hand and fired a shot at [Zheng Hanshou]'s forehead. The gunshot echoed throughout the room, and [Aziz] inside the room instantly opened his eyes and woke up. Jiajia and her family outside the room also stopped in their tracks, looking towards the direction of the door. Then the camera focused on [Zheng Hanshou], with a hole right in the center of his forehead. He fell backwards on the ground, his eyes still open.
1:33:36|1:33:47|After taking down Zheng Hanshou with one shot, Li Zhongzhi slowly lowered his raised gun hand, then looked at Aziz to his right with red eyes. Aziz looked back at him, smiled, and then drifted into his memories.
1:33:47|1:33:53|In the scene, [Li Zhongzhi] is sitting in the car, staring blankly at his phone, then smiles at the screen.
1:33:56|1:34:4|It turns out to be a selfie video of [Li Yongzhi], which was taken during a walk by the sea.
1:34:15|1:34:22|[Li Yongzhi] looked at the sea and raised her hand to touch the bracelet on her left wrist.
1:34:38|1:34:53|Then she sat on the embankment with her backpack, lowered her head to tighten the bracelet, smiled, and spoke to her phone. After that, she raised her arm, held up the bracelet in front of the phone, took a deep breath, and slowly finished taking a selfie.
1:34:53|1:35:17|At this moment, [Li Zhongzhi] thought of the photo of the family of three again. He sat on the slide, holding [Li Yongzhi] and Xue'er, smiling happily at the camera. As the memory faded, he smiled again in the direction of [Aziz], then raised the gun and pressed it against his own temple. After taking a deep breath and furrowing his brow, [Li Zhongzhi] smiled at [Aziz] with red eyes. The scene then shifted to outside the house, where [Aziz]'s home was surrounded by warm lights.
1:35:17|1:35:29|A gunshot shattered the warmth, at this moment, a hand cuffed to the steering wheel, belonging to [Cui Jie], looked towards the direction of the gunshot. Then he lowered his head, bent over, gasping for air heavily. Finally, unable to hold back, he tightly closed his eyes and tears streamed down his face.
1:35:29|1:35:54|After a moment of calm, he looked up again towards the front of the car as if he had made up his mind. Then the screen went black, and the image of [Cui Jie] appeared. He sat with his hands crossed on a bench in the corridor, as a nurse slowly walked past in the background. On the other side, [Sang Er] lay on the operating table with a surgical cap on, while a doctor guided her to exert force and cheered her on. [Sang Er] cried and pushed hard, then she looked down and smiled.
