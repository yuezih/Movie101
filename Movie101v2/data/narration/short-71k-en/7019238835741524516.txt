0:1:57|0:2:5|The guy on the phone hung up without saying a word, leaving the helpless young man staring into the pitch-black corridor. Despite his fear, he had no choice but to move forward. Facing the eerie corridor, the young man...
0:2:5|0:2:28|Still, he plucked up the courage and walked in. In the dimly lit corridor, the delivery guy shouted out, and the motion sensor lights responded by illuminating the hallway. With the brief light, he nervously surveyed the surroundings, finding nothing unusual. Despite his fear, the delivery guy bravely climbed the stairs to the second floor. He pushed open the door to the stairwell and entered the hallway of the residents.
0:2:28|0:2:50|The corridor in front of him was narrow and dark, with only a flickering light at the end. His fear had reached its peak, and he dared not take a step forward, staring ahead. Then he remembered there were motion sensor lights in the hallway. He stomped his foot, and the hallway instantly lit up. But in the next second, the light went out, revealing a red-clothed female ghost standing at the end of the corridor.
0:2:50|0:3:18|The young man, frightened, quickly shouted to turn on the sound-controlled light, but the light went out again in an instant. This time, the red-clothed female ghost appeared in front of him in an instant. As the ghost slowly lifted her head, the light once again flickered on and off. However, this time, the female ghost did not reappear. The young man, trembling with fear, slowly opened his eyes. When he confirmed that the ghost was gone, he breathed a sigh of relief. But just then, he suddenly turned his head.
0:3:19|0:3:37|The red-dressed female ghost had a pale face, with her mouth cracked from the corners to her cheeks, blood dripping, and a gaping mouth standing behind the young man. The terrified delivery guy, screaming in fear, grabbed the box and ran for his life. At this moment, the full appearance of [Zhao Dianpao] slowly became apparent, revealing that high-rise buildings surrounded the eerie and terrifying run-down neighborhood.
0:3:37|0:3:42|Contrastingly, the Moe Guifang on top of this deep pit appears extremely abrupt and eerie.
0:3:42|0:3:59|After scaring away the delivery guy, the terrifying red-dressed female ghost continued to linger in the hallway. Just then, the two-wheeled electric balance scooter under her feet issued a warning of low battery. The scooter malfunctioned and moved back and forth awkwardly, while the ghost standing on it swayed in a comical manner.
0:3:59|0:4:16|The terrifying female ghost just now was actually portrayed by [Zhao Dianpao]. As [Zhao Dianpao] was speaking, he stumbled and fell to the ground. After getting up in a sorry state, [Zhao Dianpao] returned to the alley. The sudden appearance of [Zhao Dianpao] frightened his partner [Zhang Yonggan], who was eating noodles in the room, causing him to be in a state of panic.
0:4:51|0:4:56|Suddenly, special effects gave Xu Tianyu a beautiful long hair on his head. The two of them stifled their laughter and quickly changed the subject.
0:5:35|0:5:54|[Jiding] rode the elevator alone to the 4th floor. As the elevator door slowly opened, [Jiding] was faced with an equally chilling corridor, with the lights flickering eerily. Faced with such a terrifying scene, [Jiding] calmly closed the elevator door after just a glance. But just as the elevator door was about to close, a pair of horrifying hands suddenly reached in through the gap.
0:6:5|0:6:11|After A Ping finished her live stream, [Zhao Dianpao] appeared above her head dressed as a female ghost.
0:7:28|0:7:46|After hearing the boss's deadly order, [Zhao Dianpao] leaned his head on [Zhang Yonggan]'s shoulder in despair. Looking at the homemade elimination plan on the wall, [Zhang Yonggan] also felt his eyes moisten, as he knew the difficulty of this mission. Late that night, seven people gathered on the rooftop to discuss strategies for dealing with recent supernatural events. At that moment, [A Ping] sitting at the table spoke first.
0:10:1|0:10:8|[A Ping] finished speaking, and the group agreed to invite [Sister Ling] to Menggui Fang. The seven of them stood in the courtyard, waiting for the arrival of this savior [Sister Ling].
0:10:8|0:10:15|After waiting for a long time, [Wang Baojian] looked at his watch with some concern and said,
0:10:19|0:10:43|Several people cast their hopeful gazes towards the entrance, only to see [Sister Ling] riding a tricycle filled with various tools for exorcism, swaying along the path. As she approached, it was noticed that [Sister Ling] had an extremely flamboyant appearance. In the deep night, she was wearing a leopard print sun hat and sunglasses, lacking the dignified aura of a Taoist priest. Afterwards, [Sister Ling] stopped in front of the group, took off her sunglasses, and looked at everyone with a proud expression on her face.
0:10:43|0:10:52|After a moment of silence, [A Ren] spoke out frankly,
0:11:3|0:11:11|[Sister Ling] just intimidated a few people, but the next second she was embarrassedly hooked by the hook on the tricycle and her stockings were torn.
0:11:13|0:11:20|During the conversation, [Sister Ling] opened a photo album of herself with world-famous stars, but all these photos were actually forged.
0:11:46|0:11:52|[A Ping] ran up and handed the red envelope to [Sister Ling],
0:12:54|0:13:0|Upon hearing his words, [Sister Ling] looked somewhat flustered in the direction of [Wang Baojian]'s gaze.
0:13:8|0:13:33|Following Sister Ling's lead, the group arrived in the haunted corridor. Sister Ling held a talisman stick in her left hand and a ghost-seeking compass in her right hand, walking forward with a solemn expression. As she walked, she kept chanting spells. Suddenly, the compass needle pointed towards the room of Jin San and his wife. Just as Sister Ling opened the door, A Ming shouted and kicked the door with such force that he tumbled into the room.
0:13:33|0:13:42|Sister Ling happened to fall in front of the red liquid oozing out from the gap of the bathroom door. Upon seeing the blood-like liquid on the floor, she was not afraid. Instead, she walked up and dipped her fingers in it, saying:
0:13:49|0:14:4|Upon finishing speaking, [Sister Ling] pushed the door open and walked in, only to be hit by a strange smell. Inside the small bathroom, clutter filled every corner, with mold covering the tiles on the walls and floor. However, the most striking sight was the splattered blood everywhere.
0:14:4|0:14:16|The crowd outside looked at Sister Ling with confusion as she chanted spells and danced. Just then, Sister Ling walked out.
0:15:8|0:15:28|At this moment, [Wang Baojian] slowly raised his hand. Seeing that this relative was not easy to fool, [Sister Ling] took out her special skills. She laid out numerous items for exorcism on the table. After preparing, she confidently put on the talisman she had stolen from the crew, then lit three sticks of incense and placed them in the censer. Just as she was about to perform the ritual, she was startled by the figure in a long skirt, [Wang Baojian].
0:15:32|0:15:50|But this little incident did not affect [Sister Ling]. She lit a talisman, then skillfully soaked it in the wine and drank it in one gulp before quickly turning around and spraying it on everyone's faces. Then [Sister Ling] lit the smoke cakes in everyone's bowls one by one.
0:16:8|0:16:15|The room was shrouded in thick smoke as they spoke. What was bright just moments ago was now barely visible, with visibility less than half a meter. [Sister Ling], under the cover of the smoke, was reciting incantations confidently while packing up to escape.
0:16:17|0:16:28|While the people inside the house were still being tormented by the thick smoke, [Sister Ling] had already arrived outside. Instead of immediately fleeing, she lit another smoke bomb at the door and threw it in, listening to the cries of the people inside.
0:16:45|0:16:55|In the midst of chaos, the bowl containing the tobacco leaves in Li Juhua's hands shattered on the ground, causing panic among the crowd. Just as Li Juhua was afraid and took a step back, she suddenly felt someone pressing closely against her back.
0:16:55|0:17:10|[Juhua Li] gathered up her courage and slowly turned around, only to see a figure in a red dress with long hair standing in the midst of smoke. Just as [Juhua Li] screamed in shock, the figure turned around, revealing that the ghost that had startled [Juhua Li] was actually [Wang Baojian].
0:17:38|0:17:51|With just a touch of makeup, [A Ping] fixed her appearance. But just as [A Ping] was admiring herself, she saw a round, slightly reflective ball with some hair around it moving in the mirror. [A Ping] turned around and screamed when she saw it.
0:17:53|0:18:0|What A Ping saw was actually A Ren squatting on the ground searching for a wig. A Ren, holding his Mediterranean hairstyle, roared loudly.
0:18:35|0:18:44|Upon hearing the eerie eighth sound, everyone couldn't help but tremble. At this moment, [Wang Baojian] smiled and said,
0:19:44|0:19:52|At the end of the line, [A Ming] slowly turned around. At this moment, [Zhao Dianpao] put on the previous disguise and joined them. Everyone saw this and ran towards the door as if their lives depended on it, but only the sick [A Ming] pretended with his hand to be a walkie-talkie and said,
0:20:14|0:20:20|Just as everyone was still looking for A Ming, they saw A Ming carrying the ghostly Zhao Dianpao on his back running towards them in the corridor.
0:20:25|0:20:35|Coincidentally, at this moment, [Wang Baojian] pushed open the corridor door and entered. When he saw the long-haired female ghost, he mistook her for his wife and tried to rush towards her. Seeing [A Ming] approaching with the female ghost on his back, the others quickly pushed [Wang Baojian] out.
0:20:41|0:20:52|[A Ming], who was determined to save people, also followed out. But when he was about to enter the elevator, [Zhao Dianpao]'s head got stuck in the door frame.
0:21:18|0:21:27|Sister Ling shuttles back and forth between the second and third floor corridors, with Zhao Dianpao escaping one moment and being carried by Wang Baojian the next, the scene is extremely comical.
0:21:49|0:22:4|Sister Ling looked at the piggy bank filled with hundreds of coins and said, Sister Ling slowly stood up with the piggy bank in hand, her eyes filled with determination as she gazed at the building behind her.
0:22:17|0:22:40|While the others were still guessing, [Sister Ling] had already draped the hemp rope net from the tricycle over her body, then took out the peach wood sword. Drawing the sword blade, [Sister Ling] did not expect this seemingly old wooden sword to emit a dazzling light. Moments later, [Zhao Dianpao] was surrounded by several people holding various red furniture. Before [Zhao Dianpao] could figure out how to escape, [Sister Ling] dropped a large net from the second floor to cover him. At this moment, [Zhao Dianpao] crouched on the ground, covering his face in confusion.
0:22:51|0:23:13|Just now, the few who had just gathered their courage scattered in the face of this situation. But at this moment, [Sister Ling] stepped forward, raising the peach wood sword to drive away evil, shouting loudly as she charged towards the terrifying ghost in front of her. And facing a wooden sword, [Zhang Yonggan] naturally showed no fear, engaging in a direct confrontation. In an instant, the two figures intertwined, with just one round, the sword in [Sister Ling]'s hand was cut into two pieces, and [Zhang Yonggan] then immediately wielded a samurai sword to strike towards [Wang Baojian] in front of the female ghost.
0:23:13|0:23:18|At this moment, [A Ming] stepped forward and effortlessly held the sharp blade in the air with just one hand.
0:23:34|0:23:46|Angry [Zhang Yonggan] forcefully drew his samurai sword, blood gushed from [A Ming]'s palm, after [A Ren] dragged the two people in front of the female ghost away, [Zhang Yonggan] swiftly cut off the red net on [Zhao Dianpao]'s body.
0:23:50|0:24:1|[Zhang Yonggan] paid no attention, but solemnly placed the samurai sword in front of him, protecting [Zhao Dianpao] as they retreated step by step into the building. When the two returned to the alley, [Zhao Dianpao] abandoned the grimace with a look of grievance and said,
0:25:17|0:25:38|Shortly after, [Sister Ling] collided with the two in the dim corridor. In a hurry, [Zhang Yonggan] covered [Sister Ling]'s mouth. Desperate to break free, [Sister Ling] fiercely bit [Zhang Yonggan]'s hand. In the intense pain, [Zhang Yonggan] lost his rationality and exerted all his strength to shake off [Sister Ling]. However, the force was too strong, and [Sister Ling] was thrown downstairs. After rolling several times on the hard cement steps, she lay motionless on the ground. The two were tense for a long time.
0:25:40|0:25:45|Trembling, Sister Ling walked up to take a closer look at the situation.
0:26:23|0:26:27|Soon after, Sister Ling and Xu Dafu turned around and started looking for a saw, but as soon as they turned back, they found that their legs had disappeared.
0:26:31|0:26:35|[Zhang Yonggan] bravely inspected the situation and said to the trembling [Zhao Dianpao],
0:27:11|0:27:26|While the two were busy searching for materials, Sister Ling slowly emerged from the trash can. It turned out that Sister Ling had fallen down without any major injuries, just briefly losing consciousness. While the two were collecting flammable materials in the corner with their backs turned, Sister Ling had already quietly climbed out of the bin. Just then, Zhang Yonggan inadvertently turned his head.
0:27:40|0:27:48|After the two calmed down, they joined forces to put Sister Ling back into the bucket and locked it.
0:28:13|0:28:20|The barrel is already several meters away from them. The two of them hugged each other in panic, and [Zhang Yonggan] tried hard to explain.
0:28:23|0:28:31|Just before they started talking, the trash can suddenly moved in front of the two of them. When they saw this scene, they were so scared that their legs went weak, but [Zhang Yonggan] tried to comfort them as much as possible.
0:28:34|0:28:43|The trash can turned a corner without hesitation and walked towards the deep end of the corridor. [Zhang Yonggan] looked at the trash can and said,
0:28:49|0:29:10|The deafening thunder outside the window completely shattered the psychological defense of the two, unable to restrain the fear in their hearts any longer, they ran out of Menggui Fang without looking back. Just as the two had just run onto the small road, a dazzling light shone on their faces. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be the boss [Xu Tianyu] driving a luxury car and happened to arrive. After getting out of the car, [Xu Tianyu] looked very angry at the two trying to escape.
0:29:10|0:29:21|Approaching the two of them with his black bodyguard, [Xu Dafu] questioned aggressively,
0:29:55|0:30:1|[Xu Tianyu] finished speaking and immediately turned to the black bodyguard, making a terrifying face that he thought was scary. Then he whispered,
0:30:38|0:30:53|Before long, the three disguised individuals returned to Menggui Fang. Leading the way was [Xu Tianyu] in a vampire costume, while [Zhang Yonggan] and [Zhao Dianpao] were dressed as Qing Dynasty zombies, following closely behind. At that moment, [Xu Tianyu] turned around and said,
0:31:0|0:31:11|[Xu Tianyu] felt a sense of unease, but still slowly turned around. Suddenly, [Sister Ling] appeared in a costume resembling an ancient old lady, standing silently under the flickering lights in the hallway.
0:31:11|0:31:17|[Xu Tianyu] saw the two people behind him trembling in fear, and casually said,
0:32:56|0:33:9|[Zhang Yonggan] finished speaking, then imitated the appearance of Qing Dynasty zombies, quickly bouncing away. Surprisingly, [Xu Tianyu], who is a vampire, also panicked and followed suit. When the three of them arrived at the elevator, the still frightened [Xu Tianyu] continued to bounce as he pressed the elevator button.
0:33:14|0:33:31|The elevator door slowly opened at this moment, and the three of them rushed into the elevator one after another. When the last person entered, [Zhang Yonggan] quickly pressed the close button. Several people watched the elevator door slowly closing as if they had been given a new lease on life, but at that moment, [Sister Ling]'s head suddenly appeared between the elevator doors, causing the three of them to panic.
0:33:40|0:33:50|[Sister Ling] slowly walked into the elevator, step by step approaching the three people. When she reached [Zhang Yonggan], she clenched her teeth, and the sweat on her forehead kept dripping like flowing water.
0:33:55|0:34:9|[Zhang Yonggan] thought for a moment and then explained, while [Sister Ling] listened without further questions and turned to [Zhao Dianpao], who was also sweating profusely.
0:34:14|0:34:21|The three of them looked at Xu Tianyu, who was crying in the corner, unable to come up with an excuse. Xu Tianyu helplessly said,
0:34:39|0:34:59|At this moment, the elevator doors slowly opened, and [A Ping] looked at the people inside the elevator in confusion. By the time she realized what was happening, she had forgotten to escape and could only scream loudly. The three people inside the elevator, who were already panicking, took this opportunity to quickly escape and pushed the screaming [A Ping] back inside. However, once the elevator doors closed, the two of them burst into laughter.
0:34:59|0:35:8|After Sister Ling slipped away in the trash can, she revealed the truth to the residents. Sister Ling and the others then planned to deal with the three half-ghosts in the same way.
0:35:8|0:35:19|In the elevator, [Sister Ling] and [A Ping] took out flashlights prepared in advance, swinging them around in the elevator. The three outside the elevator looked through the gap at the eerie light, their hair standing on end in fear.
0:35:19|0:35:33|At this moment, the elevator door suddenly opened. The two who were dancing just now froze instantly. Fortunately, [Sister Ling] reacted in time and pretended to be a ghost. Just as [Sister Ling] was about to bite her neck with an open mouth, the elevator door closed automatically once again.
0:35:33|0:35:41|When the elevator doors opened again, [Sister Ling] was seen covered in blood, gnawing on [A Ping]'s body. The three of them were so horrified by the scene that they couldn't make a sound.
0:35:46|0:36:0|The three of them looked at the seemingly still beating heart, the fear in their hearts had reached its peak, and they ran back like headless flies. After [A Ping] helped [Sister Ling] remove the ice pack, [Sister Ling] took out her phone and said to the others,
0:36:0|0:36:20|Three people were running desperately in the corridor. At that moment, Zhao Dianpao, who was at the back, collided with the suddenly opened iron door and then fainted on the ground. Zhao Dianpao was dragged into the room, and in the next moment, Zhang Yonggan was also knocked unconscious by the opened iron door. Xu Tianyu, filled with fear, quickened his pace and ran out of Menggui Fang without looking back.
0:36:20|0:36:23|The residents gathered together afterwards, celebrating joyously.
0:36:24|0:36:35|Everyone finished the aged medicinal liquor in one gulp. Although there was no sumptuous dinner on the table, only some scattered melon seeds and peanuts, everyone couldn't contain their joy.
0:38:38|0:38:51|As Wang Baojian spoke, his nose tingled and his eyes became moist, he turned his head back. Hearing such genuine emotions, the silent Jin San also began to tell his story.
0:39:57|0:40:4|[A Ping] finished speaking with a sobbing voice, and deeply touched, [A Ren] immediately said,
0:40:13|0:40:20|After embracing each other, they all looked towards Sister Ling who was eating canned food greedily on the side.
0:41:8|0:41:14|Everyone looked down with sadness on their faces after hearing that, wanting to offer comfort but not knowing how to start.
0:41:21|0:41:27|Slowly took out a pair of vintage sunglasses that transcended eras,
0:42:18|0:42:24|The solemn crowd looked at [Sister Ling], and at this moment, [A Ren] spoke,
0:42:36|0:42:55|Suddenly, Sister Ling's phone broke the silence. She walked towards the door while Wang Baojian inside the room spread his hands to show that he had nothing. But A Ren didn't believe it, and he picked up the last can of meat from Wang Baojian and put it in his pocket, while the others were still playing around.
0:42:55|0:43:18|[Sister Ling] who answered the phone frowned, her face darkened, as if sensing an ominous aura between the buildings of Menggui Fang. At the same time, [Jiding] in the room also noticed something unusual. He walked to the table and saw the water in the cup shaking constantly. Even the lights in the corridor were flickering more intensely than usual. At this moment, a large number of ragged zombies inexplicably appeared in the courtyard of Menggui Fang. Upon seeing this, [A Ming] on the balcony angrily rushed in.
0:44:12|0:44:40|As soon as the voice fell, the wooden door behind the young man creaked, and the irritable [A Ming] saw an outsider intruding and angrily rushed out with a knife. Just as he pushed the door, he saw a severely decayed zombie with a big mouth full of blood rushing to knock [A Ming] down. Seeing this, [A Ren] was about to raise his hand to chop the zombie, but was scared by its harmful appearance and kept retreating. Just as it was about to bite [A Ming], [Sister Ling] held the zombie's jaw with both hands and rescued [A Ming]. However, the outnumbered [Sister Ling] was also bitten on the arm by the zombie.
0:44:42|0:45:1|The young man finished speaking and ran away, leaving only [A Ming] and [A Ren] struggling to control the zombies. The two of them managed to trap the zombies in the elevator and quickly asked [Sister Ling] for help. When [Sister Ling] rolled up her sleeves, two rows of blood were clearly visible. However, before they could tend to their wounds, they saw a large group of zombies limping towards them through the crack in the door. Just then, the delivery guy who had just escaped pushed open the corridor in a panic.
0:45:3|0:45:23|As the door burst open, the neighbors who heard the cries just stuck their heads out to see what was happening. Suddenly, a large group of zombies pounced on the young man like hungry dogs, ruthlessly devouring him. After a moment, a zombie with a twisted face and rotting features stood up, still holding a piece of flesh. Fortunately, by then everyone had already hidden in the room.
0:45:40|0:45:43|The journalist who had just finished the interview was also surrounded by zombies.
0:45:45|0:46:0|The few people in front of the TV watched the scene so realistically, trembling in fear, while a large number of zombies smelling blood rushed into the corridor. Just now, the three formidable [Sister Ling] could only hold onto the overhead wires in the corridor to support themselves.
0:46:0|0:46:21|Coincidentally, in this moment of extreme crisis, Sister Ling's sausage slipped from her waist and was about to fall onto the zombie's head. Fortunately, Sister Ling quickly caught the sausage. Just as she breathed a sigh of relief, the can of fish in her pocket also fell down. A Ren, although complaining, managed to catch the can of fish in a close call. At this moment, Li Juhua in the room expressed her concern.
0:46:26|0:46:37|Before anyone else could come up with a plan, [A Ping] opened the door, attracting the aimless zombies. They rushed into the house frantically, but luckily, [Wang Baojian] quickly closed the door in time.
0:46:43|0:46:55|At this moment, [A Ping] suddenly remembered the two people tied up in the room, [Zhang Yonggan] and [Zhao Dianpao]. After struggling to untie the ropes, [A Ping] didn't have time to explain much to them. They immediately joined forces to push against the door.
0:47:0|0:47:20|At this moment, the three people outside holding the wires were about to collapse. Just then, Sister Ling and A Ming's canned food fell on the zombie's head, waking them up. The zombies immediately lunged towards the three people on the wires. Fortunately, the three were positioned high enough that the zombies couldn't reach them. However, as the three's strength drained, their bodies began to slide downward.
0:47:20|0:47:36|At this moment, everyone in the room rushed out with torches and candles in hand, forcing the zombies at the door to retreat step by step under the flames. Seeing this, the zombies slowly moved towards [Sister Ling] and the other two. Just then, a zombie suddenly bumped into the toy fire pot in [Jin San]'s hand.
0:47:39|0:47:55|The zombies suddenly became agitated, and the group's escape route could be engulfed at any moment. Upon seeing this, [Wang Baojian] hastened to rescue the three people on the wire, just as the flames were about to extinguish. Seeing this, the group rushed towards the stairwell with all their might. [Zhang Yonggan] and [Zhao Dianpao] bravely held up the door at the rear.
0:47:57|0:48:10|At this moment, the zombies broke through the window and dragged the two people blocking the door out. In an instant, the two were overwhelmed by the tide of corpses. Seeing no way out, everyone hurried to the rooftop, only to find the door locked.
0:48:39|0:48:45|With the zombies getting closer and closer, [A Ren] fumbled for what seemed like an eternity to insert the key into the lock, in just a few short seconds.
0:48:51|0:48:56|The crowd also rushed up to the rooftop, and with the combined effort of the three men, they barely managed to put the bolt on the door.
0:49:1|0:49:10|The group crossed the small bridge built on the rooftop and arrived at another building. However, they still had no strategy to deal with the zombies that could break in at any moment from behind.
0:49:16|0:49:37|[Sister Ling] looked at the dead end in front of her, unable to come up with an answer for a moment. Just as she was racking her brains, her arm that had been bitten suddenly started twitching uncontrollably. Before Sister Ling could react, her hand slapped her own face repeatedly. Everyone was horrified and backed away. Suddenly, [A Ming] rushed forward, grabbed Sister Ling's arm, and shouted,
0:49:52|0:50:8|[Sister Ling] relied on her strong will to extend her right arm, but the next moment her right hand clenched into a fist and struck directly at the opponent's face. Determined, [Sister Ling] once again raised the sickle high, ready to strike with force. However, the sickle was blocked at a vital point, and at this moment, her right hand forcefully pulled at her own face. Helplessly, [Sister Ling] grabbed her right wrist and said,
0:50:10|0:50:17|Hardly had the words fallen from his lips when his right hand broke free from control and grabbed Sister Ling's chest with force.
0:50:46|0:50:54|Soon after, the group joined forces to lift the pillar ladder and slowly pushed it towards the opposite building. Several people tried to build an escape passage between the two floors using the ladder.
0:50:59|0:51:24|Shortly after, several people actually listened to the unreliable advice of [Sister Ling]. They saw [A Ming] take a firm stance, channeling his energy to his lower abdomen and vertically propping up the long ladder at the edge of the roof. Without a word, [A Ren] began climbing step by step towards the top of the ladder. The others ran to [A Ming]'s side to help secure the ladder. After a moment, [A Ren] tremblingly reached the top. Even in such a high place, not even a gangster could bear to feel afraid.
0:51:32|0:51:47|This is [A Ming] shouting loudly. As soon as the words fell, [A Ming] burst out with all his strength, stepping on the edge of the wall. Without any hesitation, he leaned forward and, with the ladder, fell vertically towards the building opposite. With the concerted efforts of everyone, [A Ren] was able to firmly grasp the opposite wall.
0:51:47|0:52:10|At this moment, as the zombies outside broke the window, [Wang Baojian] tied [Jiding] behind his back with a cloth strip. Gritting his teeth, he climbed the ladder with difficulty. Every step forward was a huge burden on the bodies of [A Ming] and [A Ren]. However, just at this moment, the usually calm and composed [Jiding] suddenly burst into tears and struggled.
0:52:43|0:52:48|Wang Baojian, who had just started speaking, suddenly realized that his son was speaking. He stopped in disbelief.
0:52:56|0:53:0|Satisfied [Wang Baojian], after hearing his son's words, climbed forward with renewed vigor.
0:53:36|0:53:45|At this moment, the crossbeam grabbed by [Jin San] suddenly broke, leaving half of his body hanging in the air. Fortunately, [Li Juhua] stood by him and pulled [Jin San] up to the top of the ladder.
0:53:52|0:54:0|At this moment, Sister Ling kept twitching, suddenly she turned her head violently, only to see Sister Ling with a grim expression, bloodshot eyes in her right eye.
0:54:23|0:54:49|After shouting, [A Ping] gained great courage and soon arrived at [A Ren]'s side. At that moment, the tireless zombie unexpectedly knocked open the lotus leaves above the iron gate. Seeing the gate on the verge of collapse, [Sister Ling] decisively tied the rope from the ladder around herself and used her body to secure the ladder, forcing [A Ming] to climb forward. However, just as [A Ming] was climbing, the ladder suddenly broke.
0:54:49|0:54:55|But [A Ming], relying on his physical fitness, stubbornly grabbed the two ends of the ladder and shouted loudly,
0:55:37|0:55:59|At this moment, the iron gate of the rooftop collapsed with a loud noise, and [Sister Ling] watched as zombies kept pouring out from the narrow door, her eyes showing no fear but rather a strong determination. She still tightly held the rope in her hands, using her own body to buy more time for [A Ming] hanging in mid-air. On the opposite building, the onlookers could only wail helplessly as the zombies drew closer and closer to [Sister Ling].
0:55:59|0:56:21|As [Sister Ling] had already been regarded as family by the neighbors, it was a cruel twist of fate that she was engulfed by the horde of zombies in the next moment. With no strength left, [Sister Ling] helplessly let go of the rope in her hand. Meanwhile, [A Ming], who was hanging in mid-air, crashed heavily into the wall. The survivors watched this scene with deep sorrow. Although saving [Sister Ling] had become impossible,
0:56:33|0:56:42|Amidst the continuous shouting of the crowd, [A Ming] gradually woke up. Upon waking up, [A Ming] seemed to have a relapse. He stood up and kept looking around.
0:57:19|0:57:38|During the conversation, the strong spotlight on the rooftop suddenly turned on, illuminating the entire neighborhood. The previously disorganized zombies now formed a neat formation and started running towards the group. Just as everyone was puzzled, the zombie formation had already lined up in an orderly manner. At that moment, the delivery guy pulled Zhang Yonggan and Zhao Dianpao over.
0:57:48|0:58:0|As the words fell, the zombie formation automatically split from the middle, forming a path. At the end of the formation, the real estate speculator [Xu Dafu] dressed in finery, leaning on a cane, slowly walked towards the group under the protection of four handsome bodyguards.
0:58:1|0:58:10|[Xu Dafu] hypocritically said with a tearful voice,
0:58:38|0:58:41|[Jin San] saw [Xu Dafu] acting shamelessly, pointed at him for a while before angrily saying,
0:59:6|0:59:21|[Xu Dafu] transformed into the director and shuttled back and forth among the consumers in zombie makeup. As he gradually got into character, [Xu Dafu] limped and fell to the ground. After immersing himself in the performance, [Xu Dafu] was still unsatisfied with the consumers' acting, so he personally demonstrated it.
1:3:10|1:3:16|[Sister Ling] was speechless after hearing this, and at this moment, [Xu Dafu], who had calmed down, said softly,
1:3:23|1:3:31|Sister Ling, who was reluctant to believe, was pushed away by the bodyguard.
1:3:37|1:3:51|[Xu Dafu] finished speaking majestically, and the spotlights on the rooftop immediately went out. Instead, two moving spotlights appeared above the heads of the crowd. [Xu Dafu] stood in front of the formation, leading the consumers who looked like zombies, and they unexpectedly started dancing the zombie dance along with the music.
1:3:51|1:4:0|This eerie dance, combined with everyone's realistic zombie costumes, surprisingly doesn't feel out of place at all. This dance seems to symbolize their victory in the struggle against the nail households.
1:4:0|1:4:10|With a provocative glance from [Xu Dafu] towards Sister Ling, this dance comes to an end. The once constantly screaming and thrilling Menggui Fang is now unusually quiet.
1:4:10|1:4:20|Sister Ling, who was kicked out of Menggui Fang, has returned to her previous life of street vending. Unlike before, this time Sister Ling is not shouting, but watching as her neighbors gather gifts for her, lost in memories.
1:4:53|1:5:2|Thinking of all this, [Sister Ling] let out a sigh of resignation. But as she set down the watch and picked up a gold tooth, tears welled up in her eyes as she began to reminisce.
1:5:7|1:5:20|Wang Baojian's bloodstains at the corner of his mouth had not been wiped off yet when he said, and everyone present couldn't help but gasp in shock. At this moment, Sister Ling at the stall looked at the gold tooth and the gifts from everyone with a heart full of apology.
1:5:20|1:5:25|Early the next morning, Xu Dafu's bodyguard rushed in with a computer in hand, anxiously.
1:6:46|1:6:57|Even the sick A Ming refused to accept help from Sister Ling, so Sister Ling went to the haunted house to find A Ping. After a scream, the ghostly A Ping in the haunted house recognized Sister Ling.
1:7:39|1:7:46|The news about Sister Ling in Menggui Fang is being reported by major media outlets. In the billiard room, A Ming and A Ren are watching.
1:8:0|1:8:20|At night, [Sister Ling] sat wearily outside the tent, propping up her head with one hand. She accidentally dozed off, but quickly woke up and took out a bottle of medicated oil to apply on her nose, forcing herself to stay awake. Suddenly, she noticed [Jiding] approaching her slowly, holding a photo frame.
1:8:42|1:8:49|[Jiding] sighed in frustration after listening, then reached out to take back the photo frame. Looking at the disappointed [Jiding], Sister Ling kindly said,
1:9:22|1:9:27|The slender [Jiding] is still far shorter than the tallest sword even when standing on tiptoes.
1:10:6|1:10:16|[Sister Ling] looked at the adorable [Jiding] in front of her, feeling immense self-blame, but she didn't want to pass on the sadness to [Jiding], so she continued to play with him.
1:10:22|1:10:48|After that, [Sister Ling] and [Jiding] burst into laughter. Despite their efforts over the past few days, only [Jiding] had forgiven them. Nevertheless, [Sister Ling] was deeply comforted by this. She embraced [Jiding], looking at the child whose fate resembled her own with eyes full of love. Meanwhile, [Wang Baojian], who had been hiding in the building, saw this motherly scene and tears welled up in his eyes. [Jin San] reached out and patted [Wang Baojian] on the shoulder before they walked out together.
1:11:35|1:11:53|Hearing everyone still believing in themselves so much, [Sister Ling] shed tears of joy and laughed with everyone. At this moment, all barriers disappeared. The next day, everyone gathered around, with [Sister Ling] taking the lead in formulating a detailed plan. They planned to kidnap [Xu Dafu] and take him to a pre-arranged location to force him to confess.
1:12:16|1:12:27|After finalizing the plan, [A Ren] and [A Ming] spared no effort in their training. On the day of the operation, they effortlessly defeated all of [Xu Dafu]'s bodyguards.
1:12:34|1:12:49|After saying that, [Sister Ling] shoved [Xu Dafu]'s head into the toilet. As the filthy water almost made [Xu Dafu] faint from choking, [Jin San], who was well prepared, took out the successfully developed anesthetic from his pocket and injected it all into [Xu Dafu] without mercy.
1:12:52|1:12:59|When [Xu Dafu] woke up again, he found himself imprisoned in a wooden cage, with no one around and occasional wisps of smoke rising.
1:13:33|1:13:40|In the midst of the conversation, Sister Ling led Xu Dafu into the city gate, where three large characters "Ghost Gate Pass" were prominently written on the city wall.
1:13:59|1:14:12|At this moment, the executioner cut off the tongues of three people on the execution ground one by one. In fact, the three people being cut were portrayed by [A Ping] and others, but it still scared [Xu Dafu], who had no idea about it, to the point of trembling in fear.
1:14:24|1:14:29|Subsequently, [Xu Dafu] knelt in front of the King of Hell, played by [Sister Ling], under the coercion of the Ox-Head and Horse-Face.
1:15:21|1:15:27|Just as everyone looked on with anticipation, [Xu Dafu], who had just been trembling with fear, suddenly revealed a smug smirk.
1:15:31|1:15:40|Seeing the plan exposed, [Sister Ling] and [Li Juhua] locked eyes, both at a loss for a moment.
1:16:16|1:16:20|Sister Ling looked at Xu Dafu's disdainful face and suddenly had a brilliant idea.
1:16:48|1:16:50|[Xu Tianyu] saw [Xu Dafu] beside him, stunned for a moment,
1:17:24|1:17:29|[Xu Dafu] suppressed the anger in his heart and explained,
1:18:6|1:18:10|[Xu Dafu] quickly covered [Xu Tianyu]'s mouth.
1:19:7|1:19:10|After [Xu Tianyu] truthfully confessed, he said to [Sister Ling],
1:19:20|1:19:30|Xu Tianyu stood up at this moment and walked slowly to Sister Ling's side, earnestly pleading with her.
1:19:37|1:20:3|[Xu Tianyu] looked at [Very Wong] in surprise as he took out his phone. Just as he was still very astonished, the demons and monsters such as the ox-headed and horse-faced beings all revealed their true forms. It turned out that the entire interrogation process of the two was secretly live-streamed by [A Ping] through her phone. The number of viewers in the live stream was as high as millions. With a delayed reaction, [Xu Tianyu] slowly turned his head to look at [Xu Dafu], who was still kneeling on the ground.
1:20:17|1:20:26|[Xu Dafu] looked at his son, who was full of grievances, and did not blame him, but instead pleaded with [Sister Ling],
1:21:12|1:21:31|The extraordinary [A Ren] and [A Ming] serve as the lobby security guards at the hotel. As they watch [A Ming] standing tall and saluting guests, [A Ming] jokes that he is still the same as before, occasionally pretending to be sick. However, [A Ren] seems to be more tolerant of him.
1:21:31|1:21:36|Formerly disguised as ghosts, [Zhang Yonggan] and [Zhao Dianpao] are also working as waiters.
1:22:41|1:22:54|[Sister Ling] put on gloves, picked up a brush, and cleaned the dirty toilet spotlessly. She waited professionally until it was completely clean before leaving. After finishing cleaning the toilet, she walked into the room and said to [Jiding],
1:23:20|1:23:44|Looking down from the neighboring high-rise, the once dilapidated Menggui Fang has disappeared, replaced by a luxurious hotel resembling a palace. The large pit that was used for isolation has now been filled and leveled, with greenery planted. Surprisingly, there is a huge Ferris wheel in the courtyard. The neighbors who once shared hardships and considered each other as family now live together forever as if their wishes have come true.
