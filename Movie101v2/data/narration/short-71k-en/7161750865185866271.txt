0:1:54|0:2:2|In the scene, Lan Tian's lonely figure walks through the ice and snow, the sun shining brightly overhead, with two wolves quietly following behind.
0:2:2|0:2:5|The scene changes, and the film officially begins.
0:2:5|0:2:14|Here is Jieshandaban, with an altitude of 5248 meters, located at the starting point of the three-way intersection along the southern Kunlun Mountains, crossing the uninhabited area of Qiangtang.
0:2:15|0:2:31|Gently falling snow covers the mountaintop, a small tent stands in the vast wilderness, [Lan Tian] lies in the tent, next to him the kettle is boiling, steam filling the air around his face, he coughs incessantly, his eyes vacant, lost in thought.
0:2:31|0:2:34|After a while, a figure appeared outside the tent.
0:2:35|0:2:39|A figure peered outside for a moment, then walked towards the exit of the tent.
0:2:39|0:2:44|[Yang Liusong] sat up, alertly scanning the surroundings, then unzipped the tent.
0:2:44|0:2:47|In front of us is a soldier in camouflage military uniform.
0:3:6|0:3:11|The soldier solemnly looked [Yang Liusong] up and down, making [Yang Liusong] feel a bit embarrassed.
0:3:21|0:3:28|[Xiao Qiao] took the medicine and ran to hand it to the soldier. The soldier took it and passed it to [Yang Liusong], who looked at him gratefully.
0:3:43|0:3:59|After saluting and shaking hands, the soldiers got into the car and drove towards the vast horizon. The yellow earth was covered with snow, and wisps of green clouds floated in the blue sky, blending with the horizon. Several wild geese spread their wings and flew in the distance.
0:3:59|0:4:8|[Yang Liusong] walked to the side of the road with a worried expression, watching the car gradually disappear. He turned around, behind him was still the endless desert and the dry, cold sunlight.
0:4:9|0:4:12|Unpredictable unknown dangers surrounded him.
0:4:12|0:4:20|After a moment of contemplation and hesitation, Lan Tian packed up the tent and gear, pushed his bicycle, and decided to continue the journey.
0:4:24|0:4:27|Crossing alone on foot.
0:4:27|0:4:36|Eighty days, no human habitation, no reinforcements.
0:4:42|0:4:46|Wearing gloves, adjusting the hat, looking up with determination.
0:4:46|0:4:56|He took a deep breath, pushed the car, and struggled to pass through a vertically spanning ravine, then walked forward with big steps.
0:4:56|0:5:1|The camera gradually pulls back, along the vast desert, only traces left by the wheels.
0:5:2|0:5:8|The ground beneath their feet was covered with hard soil, stones, and sand grains densely embedded within.
0:5:8|0:5:16|In the distance, the horizon stretches endlessly, with the silhouette of a sheep appearing lonely and small yet remarkably resolute.
0:5:21|0:5:33|The vast plateau desert meets the sky, with clouds hanging low and illuminated by the faint sunlight. Through the telescope, [Yang Liusong]'s figure slowly moves along the boundary line.
0:5:45|0:5:50|Depending on the road conditions, he sometimes walks forward and sometimes rides in the car.
0:5:50|0:5:54|In the vast flatlands, he left behind his resolute figure without hesitation.
0:5:54|0:5:59|The vastness of nature is magnified to the extreme at this moment, reflecting the insignificance of humanity.
0:5:59|0:6:2|Every step taken by [Yang Liusong] is precisely because of this.
0:6:5|0:6:12|Every step taken by [Yang Liusong] seems more like a declaration of bravery and resilience for humanity, knowing it is impossible.
0:6:12|0:6:20|Slowly, he walked to a lake in the desert, quenching his thirst with the lake water, which was clear and rippled with the white clouds in the sky.
0:6:20|0:6:26|He walked across the gradually melting glacier, raising his camera to capture the melting snow, which gathered into a river.
0:6:26|0:6:36|The gentle ripples in the river flow slowly, the clouds gradually lower and darken the sky as time passes.
0:6:36|0:6:42|Under the dark clouds, strong winds howled, dust filled the air, making Lan Tian's advance extremely difficult.
0:6:42|0:6:52|He propped up a large umbrella, tied it to the back of his bicycle to resist the wind, and rode towards the direction it was blowing, advancing towards the rugged and undulating mountains.
0:6:53|0:6:57|[Yang Liusong] is urgent in his heart, his body leaps into the air and kicks quickly.
0:6:57|0:7:2|The rocky terrain on the head caused it to lose balance quickly.
0:7:2|0:7:8|It fell off the car, but quickly picked itself up and continued moving forward.
0:7:8|0:7:11|The wind clears the sky, dispersing the clouds.
0:7:11|0:7:16|[Yang Liusong] arrived at a grassland, not far away were herds of Tibetan antelopes.
0:7:16|0:7:20|He got off the car and walked, watching the sheep running past.
0:7:30|0:7:36|The scene shifts, with the sky slightly darkening, he pushes a cart over a hill and arrives at a lake.
0:7:36|0:7:41|The setting sun illuminated the lake surface, creating a shimmering reflection.
0:7:41|0:7:47|On the grassy field beside, two squirrels faced the sunset, poking their heads out and looking around.
0:7:47|0:7:51|Yang Liusong unloads his gear by the lake and sets up a tent, this will be tonight's campsite.
0:7:53|0:8:2|[Yang Liusong] was completely blackened. Inside the tent, [Yang Liusong] used a portable air pump to light the stove, set up a small pot, scooped out a few spoonfuls of protein powder, and put it into the pot.
0:8:38|0:8:42|April 20, 2010, Su Camp at an altitude of 4658 meters.
0:8:55|0:9:1|[Yang Liusong] was lost in memories. It was his first day arriving at Jieshan to play table tennis, and he hitched a ride on a truck carrying sheep.
0:9:8|0:9:21|The truck stopped at the entrance of the mountain road, and [Yang Liusong] stood up from a group of sheep behind the truck, throwing the luggage down one by one. Finally, he lifted the bicycle and walked through the sheep, placing the bike down from above.
0:9:21|0:9:25|He got off the car and waved to the driver who was about to leave to express his gratitude.
0:9:25|0:9:30|On the plateau, going through this simple procedure has left him a bit out of breath.
0:9:31|0:9:34|He was panting heavily as he packed up.
0:9:34|0:9:40|The truck slowly drove away, he lowered his head and scanned around, as if feeling that something was missing.
0:9:40|0:9:44|Suddenly realizing that he had dropped two important packages.
0:9:44|0:9:47|He panicked and dropped the bike he was holding onto, chasing after the truck.
0:9:55|0:10:5|But the driver did not hear [Yang Liusong]'s shout, the car drove further and further away, [Yang Liusong] rode his bicycle to chase, [Yang Liusong] pedaled hard, but the distance kept increasing.
0:10:5|0:10:12|Gradually, [Yang Liusong] felt out of breath and had to stop, gasping for air with his mouth wide open.
0:10:12|0:10:22|Two years of careful preparation couldn't compare to a twist of fate. Two headlamps were left on the truck, so they had to return to Lhasa to replenish their supplies.
0:10:23|0:10:33|The scene shifts to the city of Lhasa, with low-rise buildings surrounded by mountains, the Potala Palace standing tall among them, clustered around the mountains, grand and majestic.
0:10:33|0:10:44|Circling up the branch-shaped stairs, one can see the White Palace supported by the edge of the horse wall, while the Red Palace sits on the mountaintop, revealing ancient and mysterious majesty.
0:10:44|0:10:47|In a narrow alley, the female lead [Lan Tian] is fixing a flat tire under the car.
0:10:55|0:11:5|He struggled to climb out from under the car, gasping for breath as he leaned against the body of the car, unzipping his jacket and using his hands to adjust his two numb and limp legs.
0:11:5|0:11:8|After wiping off the sweat, they continued to prepare to remove the tire.
0:11:8|0:11:11|Coincidentally, [Yang Liusong] rode by on his bicycle at that moment.
0:11:14|0:11:18|Lan Tian was pinned down by the tire without being supported properly.
0:11:18|0:11:22|He tried hard to move the tire with his waist and fingers.
0:11:22|0:11:25|Seeing this scene, [Yang Liusong] quickly got out of the car and helped him lift up the tire.
0:11:32|0:11:40|Pushing aside [Yang Liusong], Lan Tian struggled to put the tire on. Yang Liusong was a bit puzzled, but seeing the other's firm and stubborn appearance, he still pushed the car away.
0:11:40|0:11:46|Turning the corner, he looked back and saw the wheelchair. It turned out that [Lan Tian] was disabled.
0:11:46|0:11:49|Later, [Yang Liusong] arrived at the home of [Veteran Captain].
0:11:56|0:11:58|The Veteran Captain said to Yang Liusong.
0:12:4|0:12:8|At this moment, [Lan Tian] wheeled in.
0:12:38|0:12:39|Ice and snow storm.
0:13:3|0:13:6|The Veteran Captain nodded helplessly.
0:13:33|0:13:36|Lan Tian, in a wheelchair, left Xie.
0:13:36|0:13:39|[Yang Liusong] looked at the photos on the wall of the inn in surprise.
0:13:39|0:13:45|In the photo, [Lan Tian] stands gracefully on the plateau, with a happy smile on her face.
0:13:45|0:13:49|A song rang out, and [Yang Liusong] followed the sound into the inn.
0:13:49|0:13:53|It turned out that [Lan Tian] was playing the guitar, singing for the guests staying at the hotel.
0:14:53|0:14:58|After the performance, Lan Tian started teaching life skills to the disabled.
0:14:58|0:15:2|Following the music, Lan Tian happily sways and dances in the wheelchair.
0:15:37|0:15:42|[Yang Liusong] sets up an easel on the side, sketching a map of the desolate area of Qiangtang.
0:15:42|0:15:47|[Lan Tian] enthusiastically worked together with the disabled people, then turned towards [Yang Liusong], gazing intently at the picture.
0:15:49|0:15:57|The crowd dispersed, and in the quiet of the night, [Lan Tian] wheeled himself to the map alone.
0:16:11|0:16:16|He took out a pen and drew a question mark after the eighty days written by [Yang Liusong].
0:16:16|0:16:24|In the early morning, sunlight shines into the room, and the dog [Xiao Lang] jumps off the windowsill and runs away. The camera moves into the room.
0:16:24|0:16:29|[Lan Tian] sat up from the bed, picked up a thermos cup and drank a large glass of water, with a urine bag beside him.
0:16:30|0:16:36|He sat in a wheelchair, using his hands to lift his legs to his chest for stretching, and then struggled to put on his shoes.
0:16:36|0:16:44|On the other side, [Yang Liusong] also woke up. He furrowed his brow, lay flat on the bed for a while, and then suddenly sat up.
0:16:44|0:16:55|Carrying luggage, Lan Tian rode a bicycle to the notice board outside the inn courtyard. The board was covered with sticky notes, each with information about finding companions, carpooling, and tour guides.
0:16:56|0:17:16|[Yang Liusong] also posted a piece of paper with the words "Aliqiu Dai, [Yang Liusong], 13910093013" on it. Then, he walked to the map and looked at the question mark marked by [Lan Tian]. After a moment of contemplation, he decisively crossed out the question mark and drew an arrow pointing to the east.
0:17:16|0:17:20|In the next scene, in the courtyard, [Lan Tian] is being interviewed by a journalist.
0:18:4|0:18:7|[Yang Liusong] silently came to the rooftop and looked down at [Lan Tian].
0:18:7|0:18:18|[Lan Tian] sent off the journalists, picked up a book, and quietly started reading. Inside the book was a photo of himself, and he gently touched the smiling face in the photo.
0:18:20|0:18:33|A wave of loss and pain hit him, he suddenly threw the book away, turned and walked into the room, where he saw the arrow left by [Yang Liusong] on the map. He froze for a moment, then a faint smile appeared at the corner of his mouth.
0:18:33|0:18:37|On the other side, [Yang Liusong] in the room, recalling what [Veteran Captain] said.
0:18:50|0:18:53|The thought of these things made [Yang Liusong]'s expression even more serious.
0:18:53|0:18:58|Meanwhile, Lan Tian was sitting alone quietly on the rooftop.
0:18:58|0:19:8|He looked up at the sky, then at the distant rooftops and mountains, feeling an overwhelming sense of melancholy and sadness for those unattainable aspirations in this lifetime.
0:19:26|0:19:46|At night, [Lan Tian] wheeled himself into the courtyard of the inn. Passing by his own photo on the wall, he stopped. He looked at the free, happy, and complete self in the photo, gazing at the magnificent mountains and rivers behind him. A bold decision ignited in his heart, and a smile slowly appeared on his face.
0:19:48|0:19:57|The next morning, [Lan Tian] packed up his belongings, placed the room key next to the sleeping [Veteran Captain], and left the inn in a wheelchair.
0:19:57|0:20:9|He drove towards the mountains, and when the car reached a fork in the road, a familiar figure appeared ahead. A man pushing a bicycle was flagging down passing cars.
0:20:9|0:20:14|[Lan Tian] carefully observed and realized it was a sheep, so he stopped beside the sheep.
0:20:15|0:20:18|The memory stops, and time goes back to this moment.
0:20:18|0:20:23|Today is the second day, at an altitude of 4568 meters.
0:20:23|0:20:26|[Yang Liusong] stood by the lake, gazing into the distance.
0:20:26|0:20:30|The sky was getting light, the lake water was surging, and he set off again.
0:20:30|0:20:37|This time on the long journey, spare equipment such as sunglasses, hats, and gloves that were lost were all brought along.
0:20:42|0:20:44|The solar panel placed on the front of the car.
0:20:58|0:21:3|Time flies, and it's now the fifth day, at an altitude of 4998 meters.
0:21:3|0:21:7|[Yang Liusong] rode his bike rapidly down a hill.
0:21:7|0:21:15|Later, he pushed the cart and walked between several small hills, when suddenly a loud and strange noise came from behind.
0:21:15|0:21:22|He turned around and saw dust flying, with a sandstorm rapidly approaching him.
0:21:22|0:21:24|He exclaimed and hurriedly pushed the cart forward.
0:21:45|0:21:50|The sandstorm was fierce, swirling rapidly, creating a moment of chaos in the sky and on the ground.
0:21:50|0:21:58|[Yang Liusong] ran forward with his back against the wind, but the sandstorm closed in from all directions in the next moment, leaving him with no way out.
0:21:58|0:22:4|His eyes were also blinded by the sand, and the rolling red sand quickly engulfed him.
0:22:5|0:22:17|[Yang Liusong] could no longer distinguish the direction. He wrapped a scarf around his mouth and nose, struggling to move forward in the fierce wind. However, when he reached a slope, he lost his balance and fell to the ground.
0:22:17|0:22:23|The smoke and sand are still surging, [Yang Liusong] kneels on the ground, curling up, burying his head in his hands.
0:22:23|0:22:27|After a long time, the storm finally passed, and the world suddenly quieted down.
0:22:28|0:22:47|The yellow sand dispersed, the view became clear, and [Yang Liusong] lying on the ground was covered in sand. He slowly lifted his head, the sun was shining brightly in the sky, the intense ultraviolet rays made it difficult for him to open his eyes. He pulled down the sandcloth covering his mouth, spat out a mouthful of dust, and panted as he scanned the surroundings.
0:22:47|0:22:51|The scene cuts to [Yang Liusong] sitting in a tent, wiping the dust off his face in front of a mirror.
0:22:53|0:22:58|Afterwards, [Yang Liusong] opened the tent, and amber shimmered in the lingering light of the setting sun.
0:22:58|0:23:6|[Yang Liusong] stepped out of the tent and felt the biting cold, so he started running in circles to keep warm.
0:23:6|0:23:9|At night, [Yang Liusong] took out his camera and aimed it at [Lan Tian].
0:23:35|0:23:45|The scene returns to before the departure, at this moment, [Yang Liusong] has already caught a ride with [Lan Tian] on the winding mountain road.
0:23:45|0:23:53|The two remained silent as they traveled, with Lan Tian's face showing a hint of blue. Yang Liusong noticed that Lan Tian's brakes and accelerator had been modified due to his disability.
0:23:54|0:23:59|And the note left by Lan Tian is inserted in the sun visor of the car.
0:23:59|0:24:6|[Yang Liusong] looked at [Lan Tian] with confusion. [Lan Tian] noticed [Yang Liusong]'s gaze, but pretended nothing was wrong and continued driving.
0:24:6|0:24:13|The car arrived at Namtso Lake, one of the three sacred lakes in Tibet, with an altitude of 4441 meters, where Yang Liusong got out of the car.
0:24:15|0:24:20|The lake is surrounded by mountains, with calm and vast water, clear and tranquil blue.
0:24:20|0:24:25|[Lan Tian] took two photos, stretched his hand out of the car window, feeling extremely exhilarated.
0:24:36|0:24:40|[Lan Tian] rolled down the car window, and the two of them descended from the mountain and arrived in the city.
0:24:40|0:24:43|[Yang Liusong] is asking a driver for a ride.
0:25:7|0:25:10|Yang turned around and saw Lan Tian in front of a noodle shop across the street.
0:25:12|0:25:18|Lan Tian was pacing back and forth, calling out for the boss, when he was blocked by several steps in front of the shop.
0:25:18|0:25:31|Yang hurriedly crossed the road and ran over to help.
0:25:31|0:25:39|Yang carefully grabbed the handles of the wheelchair from behind, slowly pulling [Lan Tian] up the steps and through the somewhat narrow door.
0:25:42|0:25:49|Lan Tian, who had disinfected the tableware in hot water, noticed Yang's restlessness while dining in the noodle shop.
0:26:3|0:26:7|Yang glanced at [Lan Tian], then turned to look out the window and put down his chopsticks.
0:26:17|0:26:25|Watching [Lan Tian] calmly eating noodles, although Yang was a bit worried, he still decisively picked up his backpack and left in a hurry.
0:26:25|0:26:36|He ran onto the road, but the hitchhiking car had already driven away. He looked solemnly in the direction the car left, unconsciously took a few steps forward, and almost collided with a carriage.
0:26:36|0:26:40|Yang had no choice but to get into Lan Tian's car again.
0:26:40|0:26:46|The modified car was moving slowly, and Yang began to lose patience, so he tentatively asked [Lan Tian].
0:26:59|0:27:5|At a loss for a moment, [Yang Liusong] finally opened the car door after seeing the determined look on [Lan Tian]'s face.
0:27:15|0:27:22|[Lan Tian] said nothing, he rubbed his nose in annoyance and gave [Yang Liusong] a meaningful and icy glare.
0:27:22|0:27:26|It seems like there was some hesitation, but in the end, she acquiesced.
0:27:50|0:27:53|[Lan Tian] looked ahead and remained silent.
0:28:0|0:28:10|[Lan Tian] took a big gulp of water, nodded, and efficiently opened the car door. He took out the wheelchair parts from the back one by one and assembled them.
0:28:10|0:28:21|He supported the seat, skillfully moved onto the wheelchair from the car, then took the toiletry bag and a clean down jacket, lifted the wheel lock and slid into the bathhouse.
0:28:21|0:28:28|In the narrow alley, the sound of vendors and barking dogs never ceased, the intense sunlight shone on the car body, reflecting a dazzling light.
0:28:36|0:28:41|Time returns to the journey again, this is the tenth day at the Hengchuan Gun Altar for [Yang Liusong], at an altitude of 5,112 meters.
0:28:43|0:28:50|He arrived at a desert, with barren surroundings and no vegetation in sight. The extreme lack of oxygen made him feel dizzy.
0:28:50|0:28:54|Before my eyes, a vague black shadow appeared.
0:28:54|0:28:59|He covered one eye with his hand, while the other one focused hard on the dark figure.
0:28:59|0:29:3|He saw clearly, and saw a strong wild yak charging straight towards him.
0:29:9|0:29:19|With the warning voice of [Veteran Captain] ringing in his ears, the yaks were getting closer and closer, fear causing [Yang Liusong] to completely lose any thoughts of self-rescue, standing still in place.
0:29:19|0:29:26|The next moment, the yak suddenly stopped its charge just before hitting the person, staring straight at the human in front of it.
0:29:27|0:29:32|[Yang Liusong] was scared out of his wits, trembling and gasping with his eyes tightly shut.
0:29:32|0:29:35|A few seconds later, the yak turned and walked away.
0:29:35|0:29:39|Watching his back, [Yang Liusong] felt weak in the legs and collapsed to the ground.
0:29:39|0:29:48|Suddenly, the yak made another sudden charge, turning around and running towards [Yang Liusong] again.
0:29:48|0:29:55|[Yang Liusong] repented, quickly stood up and pushed onto the car, fleeing in panic, running to a slope, and slid down brightly and sharply.
0:30:10|0:30:16|Arriving at the slope, [Yang Liusong] found animal carcasses scattered around every few steps.
0:30:16|0:30:23|The bones have various shapes, seemingly from different species, almost all crumbling at a touch.
0:30:23|0:30:31|In the distance, there are still a few oil drums and bottles scattered around, these are traces left by humans, so are there humans among these bones as well?
0:30:32|0:30:49|Lan Tian looked down in astonishment, observing the scene in front of him. He then stood up and walked around the oil drum, while in the distance, it seemed like a pair of eyes were watching his every move, ready to strike at any moment. A sense of danger loomed in the air.
0:30:55|0:31:4|At night, with the bright moon hanging high in the sky, [Yang Liusong] sits in the tent wearing a headlamp, writing in his diary to document his journey.
0:31:4|0:31:19|Suddenly, a sharp howl of a wolf came, and he stopped writing.
0:31:19|0:31:22|He turned off the light and listened carefully to the sounds outside.
0:31:22|0:31:27|The wind was mixed with a few sharp sounds cutting through the tent.
0:31:27|0:31:29|A few seconds later, the sound gradually fades away.
0:31:29|0:31:35|[Yang Liusong] turned on the light again and continued writing.
0:31:35|0:31:40|On the twelfth day, at an altitude of 5,112 meters.
0:31:40|0:31:44|[Yang Liusong] passed by a theodolite inserted into the ground.
0:31:44|0:31:48|He parked the car on the side and looked up at the rare human traces.
0:32:1|0:32:6|[Yang Liusong] kept pacing around the measuring instrument, taking photos, drinking water, sitting down, and then standing up.
0:32:6|0:32:13|The scene returns to before the departure, with Lan Tian's car parked at Zhu Feng's gas station.
0:32:17|0:32:31|Master Lan Tian walked up to the car window and peered in, saying.
0:32:31|0:32:36|[Lan Tian] leaned half of his body out of the car window, looked back with a worried expression on his face.
0:32:36|0:32:43|Afterwards, he turned his head, pondered for a moment, sighed heavily, and reluctantly fastened his seatbelt before starting the car.
0:32:47|0:32:56|The car stopped at a high ground near the Jiaula Pass, at an altitude of 8848 meters, with Mount Everest in full view.
0:33:17|0:33:25|Not far away, one after another, the mountain peaks stretch endlessly, with snow still lingering at the top, creating a vast expanse of white.
0:33:25|0:33:33|[Lan Tian] sat in a wheelchair, facing the surrounding mountains with excitement, while a sheep quietly watched him.
0:33:33|0:33:41|Lan Tian shed tears after a long time, facing the mountains and rivers, finally feeling that his life is free and unrestrained.
0:33:54|0:34:2|Watching Lan Tian gasping for breath, Yang Liusong silently walked behind him, the gentle breeze rustling their clothes, the sky clear and pure.
0:34:2|0:34:16|Lan Tian noticed Yang Liusong behind him. He turned around and cheerfully handed the camera to him, asking for help to take a photo. Then he took off his hat, unzipped his jacket, fixed his hair, sat up straight, and revealed a brilliant smile.
0:34:17|0:34:26|[Yang Liusong] took a few steps back, squatted down and prepared to press the shutter button, but was noticed by [Lan Tian] that he hadn't removed the lens cap. [Lan Tian] smiled and reminded him.
0:34:53|0:35:12|At this moment, [Yang Liusong] stood on the theodolite, with [Lan Tian] facing the sun, her warm and pure smile shining in front of him.
0:35:54|0:36:1|At an altitude of 5117 meters, [Yang Liusong] spent the night in a vast expanse of white snow.
0:36:1|0:36:11|In the early morning, Lan Tian put a spoonful of protein powder, some cheese, and seasonings in the boiling pot, then carried it outside and looked into the distance while eating.
0:36:12|0:36:23|White clouds hang low, leading into the horizon. On the snowy ground, herds of cattle and sheep form a line, slowly moving eastward. [Yang Liusong] stands quietly, gazing for a long time.
0:36:35|0:36:43|After a while, he continued on his way, but not long after, the wind and snow descended once again, fiercely sweeping across this desolate wilderness.
0:36:43|0:36:53|[Yang Liusong] pushed his bicycle, the rapidly descending ice and snow cutting across his body like sharp blades, making each step incredibly difficult for him. Finally, the snow stopped.
0:36:53|0:36:59|Yang walked to a glacier where the ice and snow had melted, leaving behind a meandering river.
0:37:11|0:37:17|At night, [Lan Tian] lay in the tent, looking weak and in pain. He closed his eyes, breathing heavily.
0:37:17|0:37:23|In the morning, Lan Tian suddenly sat up from the ground.
0:37:30|0:37:34|[Yang Liusong] raises a small pot, cooking and keeping warm at the same time.
0:37:34|0:37:40|Slowly, he fell into contemplation, feeling worried and confused by the discomfort in his body.
0:37:43|0:37:47|Lifting his head, a shadow of an animal suddenly appeared outside the tent.
0:37:47|0:37:52|[Yang Liusong] was shocked and looked outside the tent, where a wolf was staring at him.
0:37:52|0:37:57|He quickly zipped up one side of the tent, but on the other side, the wolf was already standing there.
0:38:8|0:38:12|The sheep held a small pot and continuously resisted the wolves trying to approach.
0:38:12|0:38:19|The wolf took a few steps back, and the sheep tried to zip up the zipper, but the next second, the wolf barked and charged forward again.
0:38:19|0:38:22|After several rounds of counterattacks, [Big Wolf] finally retreated temporarily.
0:38:22|0:38:28|Yang hurriedly zipped up the tent, holding a pot nervously and alertly inside.
0:38:28|0:38:30|Suddenly, the shadow of [Big Wolf] appeared outside the tent.
0:38:34|0:38:42|[Big Wolf] kept trying to enter the tent, fear almost drove Lan Tian to lose his mind, he kept hitting the shadow outside with a pot.
0:38:54|0:38:59|Yang Liusong, exhausted, lay in the tent gasping in pain, unable to calm down for a long time.
0:38:59|0:39:6|Outside, two [wolves] are still using their claws to constantly scratch the tent, sniffing around with their noses.
0:39:6|0:39:9|One of them approached the tent corner, stuck out its tongue and licked the tent.
0:39:10|0:39:21|After a long silence, the [Big Wolf] started digging a hole in place, while the sheep inside couldn't hide its panic at this moment, it put the pot on its head and closed its eyes.
0:39:21|0:39:25|Two [big wolves] are constantly prowling outside, showing no signs of leaving.
0:39:26|0:39:33|Today's time was wasted, trapped by the [Big Wolf], the sheep could only sit in the tent all day, waiting until nightfall.
0:39:33|0:39:44|He lay on his side, listening carefully to the outside movement. After confirming there was no sound, he turned on the overhead light cautiously, half sitting up without making any noise.
0:39:44|0:39:53|The tension made him even more dry-mouthed, he picked up the thermos next to him and poured it into his mouth, but the cup was already empty, not a drop of water.
0:39:54|0:39:58|[Yang Liusong] sat up restlessly, shooting glances around the tent.
0:39:58|0:40:8|Currently, in a depression in front of the tent, there is some unidentified standing water that has caught Lan Tian's attention. He stares straight at the puddle on the ground.
0:40:8|0:40:14|Without hesitation, [Lan Tian] crawled over and swiftly drank the water on the ground in one gulp.
0:40:33|0:40:44|After drinking the water, [Yang Liusong] slowly approached the zipper, carefully assessing the situation outside with a tense look in his weary eyes.
0:40:44|0:40:55|After confirming there was no movement, [Yang Liusong] put on his assault jacket, holding a pot in one hand and a thermos cup in the other, carefully unzipping a gap and reaching out with the thermos cup.
0:41:15|0:41:21|[Yang Liusong] lay weakly, with a vacant look in his eyes, as the sound of mournful wolf howls drifted in from outside the tent.
0:41:37|0:41:52|[Yang Liusong] turned off the overhead light, and the tent was instantly plunged into darkness. The howling of wolves continued outside, and the icy despair and collapse swept over him crazily. He rested his arm on his eyes, clenched his fist, and gasped quietly.
0:41:52|0:42:3|In the scene before departure, back in the sandy area, [Yang Liusong] is helping [Lan Tian] push the car out of the sand pit.
0:42:17|0:42:24|The car was pushed out of the pit, [Lan Tian] stopped and [Yang Liusong] walked over, leaning against the car.
0:42:24|0:42:29|He took the mineral water handed to him by [Lan Tian] from the car and gulped it down in big mouthfuls.
0:42:29|0:42:41|On the side, [Lan Tian] also opened the thermos cup and drank heartily.
0:42:41|0:42:42|Lan Tian asked with concern.
0:43:59|0:44:3|[Yang Liusong] realized he had said the wrong thing and looked apologetically at [Lan Tian].
0:44:3|0:44:8|[Lan Tian] took off the small whistle tied to the rearview mirror in the car and handed it to [Yang Liusong].
0:44:16|0:44:24|The scene cuts back to this moment, with [Yang Liusong] in the tent, recalling [Lan Tian]'s words, his gaze shifting to the whistle hanging on his backpack.
0:44:24|0:44:34|He took a moment to take out the whistle, held it in his hand and examined it carefully, suddenly realizing something. At this moment, the whistle might save his life just like it once saved Lan Tian.
0:44:35|0:45:0|He rallied, sat up and looked back. He wasn't sure if blowing the whistle would bring good or bad consequences, but at the moment it seemed he had to give it his all. Finally, he summoned up the courage and blew the whistle.
0:45:0|0:45:16|It seemed to work, and there was suddenly no sound outside. The next day at dawn, [Yang Liusong] wrapped himself in the tent, only sticking his head out of the zipper to look at the road, and hurriedly fled with his bicycle.
0:45:16|0:45:23|He walked down the hillside cautiously, and when he looked back, two wolves were staring at him from the top of the slope.
0:45:23|0:45:33|Things are not looking good. [Yang Liusong] hurriedly bent over and started running. After a few steps, he suddenly stopped and looked up, only to see two wolves still following his movements.
0:45:44|0:45:49|The blinding sun cast its light down from the hilltop, enveloping their poised figures.
0:45:49|0:45:54|The tension and fear made Lan Tian's forehead covered with beads of sweat.
0:45:54|0:45:58|It uses a tent as cover, keeping the wolves at bay for the time being.
0:46:2|0:46:5|He rides his bike, starting a rapid escape.
0:46:18|0:46:21|Erlang, strong and sturdy, ran towards [Yang Liusong] from the top of the slope.
0:46:21|0:46:26|In extreme panic, [Yang Liusong] fell from the hill and tumbled down, causing chaos.
0:46:26|0:46:32|He rolled all the way to the ground, without pausing for a breath, and looked up to see two wolves on the hill.
0:46:32|0:46:40|He hurriedly pushed the cart to continue fleeing, while the not-so-low hill trapped the two wolves for a moment, causing them to linger in place.
0:46:40|0:46:44|Jianlang failed to catch up, [Yang Liusong] relaxed and continued on the normal route.
0:46:52|0:47:0|He pushed the cart onto a bumpy stone road, and suddenly there was a strange noise coming from the hillside.
0:47:0|0:47:7|He stopped and looked up, only to see a crow flying frantically overhead, with some rocks on the mountain suddenly falling.
0:47:15|0:47:27|Sensing the danger, [Yang Liusong] hurriedly sped up and walked forward, but the lack of [Yang Liusong] forced it to open its mouth to breathe, and the commotion on the hill was caused by the two wolves being lured over.
0:47:27|0:47:34|The next moment, they surrounded [Yang Liusong] one after another.
0:47:34|0:47:39|Looking at the fierce and ferocious wolf with sharp fangs in front of him, [Yang Liusong] tremblingly took out a dagger.
0:47:51|0:48:0|After a few tentative barks, two wolves suddenly ran towards [Yang Liusong], one in front and one behind. The rugged rocks caused the panicked [Yang Liusong] to fall to the ground.
0:48:0|0:48:3|It lay on the ground, waving the knife frantically at the wolves rushing towards it.
0:48:10|0:48:19|The unstoppable [Yang Liusong] crouched on the ground holding his head, but strangely, the wolf suddenly stopped its attack, glanced back a few times, and then left happily.
0:48:19|0:48:37|A heavy sound of footsteps rang in the ears, [Yang Liusong] sat up, looking around in confusion. A large black bear suddenly appeared in front of him, causing him to retreat in fear. However, the bear just passed by him and, after walking ahead, turned back to look at him before quickly leaving.
0:48:38|0:48:43|In the midst of the dusty ground, Lan Tian watched the black bear's receding figure, feeling incredulous.
0:48:48|0:48:54|Its suspended heart finally landed, lying on the ground, and it let out a long sigh of relief.
0:48:54|0:48:59|The scene cuts to Lan Tian arriving at a corner of a hill, unpacking and setting up a tent.
0:49:55|0:50:0|The cold wind was still howling, Lan Tian lifted his head, his eyes unfocused and weary.
0:50:0|0:50:12|The clouds drifted and dissipated over time, gradually disappearing to fully expose the sunlight, shining fiercely on the rocks of the bell tower and on Lan Tian.
0:50:12|0:50:17|[Yang] sat still, with the wolf beside him also lying down, closely watching every move [Yang] made.
0:50:31|0:50:36|Er Lang, alert, sat up and stared guardedly at [Yang].
0:50:36|0:50:41|[Yang] took a bite of the cake and then threw it towards Lan Tian.
0:50:51|0:50:55|[Yang] threw the cake in front of the wolf, but the wolf showed no reaction.
0:50:55|0:51:1|[Yang] helplessly took out another piece of jerky, chewed on it, and then threw it towards the wolf.
0:51:1|0:51:6|The two wolves were finally lured in this time, running up to pick them up and eat them.
0:51:6|0:51:10|[Yang Liusong] immediately got up and ran away.
0:51:10|0:51:15|In a daze, she had a hallucination that two wolves seemed to turn into giant creatures, relentlessly chasing her from behind.
0:51:22|0:51:27|He ran into the tent at full speed, zipped it up, picked up the knife, and stared outside in terror.
0:51:43|0:51:53|Gradually, Lan Tian felt a sudden intense dizziness, exhaustion and fear making his face pale, feeling all the objects in front of him floating and swaying.
0:51:53|0:52:0|Outside the tent, as the sun sets in the west, an old eagle hovers low, and the sky quickly darkens.
0:52:0|0:52:7|Before long, Yang fell asleep and woke up the next morning, startled to find a dagger still stuck in the ground beside him.
0:52:8|0:52:14|He carefully opened the tent and peeked outside, the wolf seemed to have disappeared without a trace.
0:52:14|0:52:24|He slowly walked out of the tent, carefully searched around, and confirmed that the two wolves had left before he relaxed, packed up his things, and continued on the road.
0:52:35|0:52:39|It was the 38th day, at an altitude of 4986 meters.
0:52:39|0:52:45|[Yang Liusong] walked into a vast and flat desert, surrounded by intense sunlight, completely dried up.
0:52:45|0:52:49|The body is sending signals, [Yang Liusong] urgently needs a water source.
0:52:49|0:52:52|He picked up the binoculars to explore the surroundings and search for the lake.
0:52:53|0:53:0|After no results, he took out a handheld GPS device and carefully observed the geological information displayed on it.
0:53:0|0:53:5|He then drove towards the coordinates of the water source shown on the GPS.
0:53:5|0:53:11|After a long trek, [Yang Liusong] finally arrived, only to be greeted by a desolate desert landscape.
0:53:12|0:53:17|[Yang Liusong] no longer had hesitation in his eyes, but rather silent anger.
0:53:17|0:53:22|This seems to be a divine joke on him, a test to completely break him down.
0:53:22|0:53:29|Unfortunately, [Yang Liusong] had to move on to the next location indicated by the GPS, but the result was the same.
0:53:29|0:53:33|When [Yang Liusong] arrived, all he saw was the barren sandy soil scorched by the sun.
0:53:40|0:53:47|[Yang Liusong] took out a cup from his backpack, glanced at the little water left inside, hesitated for a moment, and slowly took a sip.
0:53:47|0:53:52|Later, he looked at the cup again, with only the last sip left inside.
0:53:52|0:53:58|He really wanted to hold onto the last glimmer of hope, but he was just too thirsty, which was the most irresistible temptation for him at the moment.
0:53:59|0:54:2|He closed his eyes and took the final sip.
0:54:2|0:54:9|Suddenly, the movement beside him caught his attention. He looked up and saw the two wolves again.
0:54:9|0:54:13|They walked towards him again, staring at the sheep on the hill not far away.
0:54:13|0:54:16|Yang Liusong didn't dare to stay, quickly got on the car and left.
0:54:30|0:54:36|He walked through the dry and desolate desert, arriving near the next lake as indicated by the GPS.
0:54:36|0:54:45|He stopped by a small mound, unloaded his luggage and left it there. Then he took a water bottle and a small pot, setting off to search around.
0:54:45|0:54:51|Hard work pays off, the soil here is moist, marked by the erosion of water.
0:54:51|0:54:56|He continued forward, and finally a shallow water area appeared ahead.
0:54:56|0:54:59|[Yang Liusong] ran over excitedly and threw the things on the ground.
0:55:2|0:55:8|Reaching into the water eagerly, Lan Tian scooped up a mouthful and put it in his mouth, but the next second, he spat it out.
0:55:21|0:55:32|Yang Liusong returned to the place where the luggage was placed, looking aimlessly at the desolate and uninhabited plain in front of him, feeling helpless and disappointed.
0:55:32|0:55:39|He then walked towards the fallen bicycle, dropped what he was holding, and slowly sat down, gasping for breath.
0:55:40|0:55:47|The fatigue in his legs and the weariness in his body both hit him at once, leaning back against his luggage, he tilted his head back and didn't want to move anymore.
0:55:47|0:55:52|At this moment, a plane flew across the sky, leaving behind two white trails.
0:55:52|0:56:2|[Yang Liusong] lowered his head in thought for a moment, then lifted his bicycle again and walked towards the unknown ahead. The boundless plain seemed to merge with the sky.
0:56:2|0:56:5|[Yang Liusong] pushing his bicycle appeared particularly small.
0:56:6|0:56:14|The rugged coastal area is full of bumps and holes, and the parts on the bicycle make a metallic clashing sound due to constant shaking.
0:56:14|0:56:24|Unconsciously, it was already noon. The scorching heat from the sun above intensified, and the two wolves could be seen following the sheep from a distance.
0:56:24|0:56:32|At this moment, Lan Tian pushed his bicycle forward with his head down, bending his upper body to grip the handlebars, completely ignoring the situation behind him.
0:56:33|0:56:37|He took a few more steps forward, then suddenly looked up at the sky and stopped.
0:56:37|0:56:42|Yang Liusong turned his head and looked back wearily.
0:56:42|0:56:46|Two wolves stopped and observed him as he stood still.
0:56:52|0:57:3|Feeling down, Lan Tian looked helplessly at the endless barrel of the gun in the no man's land. A wolf watched his fading figure and quickly moved its feet to follow.
0:57:3|0:57:17|Not long after they set off, Lan Tian stopped again, turned back to look at his stunned companion, and then let out a warning howl. Soon, two wolves ran side by side behind the sheep, while the ground along the coast gradually melted away.
0:57:18|0:57:22|The sparkling water surface reflects the figure of Lan Tian gazing ahead with wolf-like eyes.
0:57:22|0:57:30|At this moment, Lan Tian, pushing his bicycle, felt the road ahead becoming increasingly blurry, and his feet felt like stepping on cotton, unable to exert any force.
0:57:30|0:57:37|Soon, the water under Lan Tian's feet became deeper and deeper, and every step he took in the water would splash water droplets.
0:57:37|0:57:41|The pant legs couldn't escape the washing of the splashes, and the soaked area was getting larger and larger.
0:57:42|0:57:48|While [Yang Liusong] himself didn't care at all, he pushed his bicycle and walked away slowly as if nothing had happened.
0:57:48|0:57:59|The sunlight shining down on the water, like soft halos floating on the lake, at this moment, the salt lake looks like a flawless jade shimmering with beautiful luster.
0:57:59|0:58:3|In the distance, the vast white lake merges with the sky.
0:58:4|0:58:6|It's almost impossible to tell whether it's water or sky.
0:58:6|0:58:24|At this moment, [Yang Liusong] is riding a bicycle floating in this shallow water, with the wheels creating a sparkling wave behind him. The clear sky above is cloudless for miles, as if washed by clear water, only the boundary at the intersection of the water fields, with a few acres of pure white clouds remaining.
0:58:24|0:58:33|[Yang Liusong] rode his bike further and further away, the empty lake surface showing no ripples, like a mirror reflecting the beautiful colors of the sky.
0:58:34|0:58:40|A few drifting white clouds are scattered along the horizon.
0:58:56|0:59:3|The light from the setting sun was no longer as intense, but it illuminated the path ahead even more brightly.
0:59:3|0:59:7|At this moment, the scene shifts back to the memories before the departure.
0:59:7|0:59:10|At this moment, Yang is riding a bicycle, pulling Lan Tian sitting in a wheelchair.
0:59:21|0:59:30|[Lan Tian] dragged the luggage placed on the car seat by [Yang Liusong], the two of them leisurely shouting on the empty road, revealing genuine smiles from the heart.
0:59:30|0:59:36|At this moment, [Lan Tian] deliberately turned the wheelchair to the right, and [Yang Liusong]'s bicycle almost rode into the ravine.
0:59:40|0:59:50|After speaking, [Lan Tian] forcefully spun the wheelchair's wheels with his hands, leaning his body forward, while [Yang Liusong] effortlessly rode his bicycle past him.
0:59:50|1:0:5|Upon reaching the top of the road, [Yang Liusong] stopped and looked ahead, at which point the smile on [Lan Tian]'s face gradually disappeared. He then stubbornly turned his wheelchair, the frequency increasing with each turn, silently watching him pass by his side.
1:0:6|1:0:11|At this moment, [Lan Tian] holds the handle and lets the wheelchair slide freely downhill.
1:0:11|1:0:15|Not long after, he let go of her hand and opened his arms wide.
1:0:15|1:0:21|[Lan Tian] sat in a wheelchair, enjoying the gentle breeze on her face, revealing a beautiful smile involuntarily.
1:0:21|1:0:28|At this moment, his hands no longer need to exert force to turn, yet they can easily wander on this incredibly wide road.
1:0:29|1:0:34|[Lan Tian] leaned back, closed his eyes, and savored the moment of pleasure.
1:0:34|1:0:37|[Yang Liusong] watched his back and smiled along.
1:0:37|1:0:43|Soon, his expression turned serious, then he mounted his bicycle and quickly rode towards [Lan Tian].
1:0:43|1:0:51|And at this moment, [Lan Tian] still had his eyes closed and arms outstretched, as [Yang Liusong] caught up and rode in front of [Lan Tian], blocking the wheelchair.
1:0:51|1:0:54|Lan Tian was thrown out before he could react.
1:0:54|1:0:57|[Yang Liusong] opened his arms and embraced her, and the two fell to the ground together.
1:0:59|1:1:7|[Yang Liusong] tried to sit up and help [Lan Tian], but she suddenly got angry and pushed away [Yang Liusong]'s hand, struggling to crawl towards the wheelchair.
1:1:7|1:1:12|[Yang Liusong] once again tried to hug him, but was coldly rejected by [Lan Tian].
1:1:12|1:1:19|Sulking Lan Tian raised his hand, took off his hat and threw it on the ground, grabbed the wheels of the wheelchair, moved his arms slowly and climbed forward.
1:1:26|1:1:30|Suddenly, she buried her head in her arms and started crying.
1:1:30|1:1:33|The sheep behind her looked at her, feeling uneasy.
1:2:0|1:2:5|[Yang Liusong] slowly lifted [Lan Tian] up from the ground, and this time he didn't struggle anymore.
1:2:5|1:2:9|[Lan Tian] sat up, tears in his eyes as he looked at [Yang Liusong].
1:3:24|1:3:32|Looking at Lan Tian, who was crying loudly, Yang Liusong reached out his hands and held him tightly in his arms, gently patting his back.
1:3:32|1:3:43|The scene returns to the desolate desert, this is the fortieth day of [Yang Liusong] crossing the barrel, at an altitude of 4991 meters.
1:3:43|1:3:53|[Yang Liusong] dug a deep hole in the ground with a small shovel, then scooped out the soil that fell into it. He placed a small basin in the hole and quickly covered it with a raincoat from the side.
1:3:54|1:4:4|[Yang Liusong] firmly pressed the raincoat with both hands, picked up a stone that had been prepared earlier, and sprinkled a handful of sand on it, afraid that there would be the slightest gap left.
1:4:4|1:4:19|Finally, he carefully checked the four corners of the package hole to ensure no air leakage. Then, he picked up a stone and broke it in half, gently placing the smaller piece in the middle. After completing all the preparations, [Yang Liusong] clasped his hands together, closed his eyes, and began to pray.
1:4:19|1:4:41|Soon, he returned to the tent, carrying a sleeping bag and a small bag, walking towards the distance. Several weathered but still standing ruins stood tall, while Lan Tian walked in the desert, his steps becoming heavier. The sun above his head became more intense, like a burning flame, the air so hot it was suffocating. Lan Tian walked in the desert,
1:4:41|1:4:47|As if about to evaporate, it moved forward while looking around into the distance.
1:4:47|1:4:53|At this moment, Lan Tian, exhausted, began to feel weak in its legs and started to walk unsteadily.
1:4:53|1:5:0|After walking to the shade behind the ruins, Lan Tian couldn't hold on any longer, threw away what was in his hands, and lay down on the beach.
1:5:0|1:5:8|As time passed, the sun slowly shifted towards where [Yang Liusong] was sleeping, and the surrounding air became hotter. The heat woke up the sheep lying on the ground.
1:5:9|1:5:15|He took off the clothes on his face, squinted his eyes, turned sideways, propped up his arms, and climbed up from the ground.
1:5:15|1:5:19|Yang looked around in a daze, his mind gradually becoming clearer.
1:5:19|1:5:24|Soon, he had returned to the place where the tents were set up along the original path.
1:5:24|1:5:29|Yang looked up at the vast sky, then gradually lowered his head in disappointment.
1:5:29|1:5:33|The extreme thirst and fatigue pressed on Lan Tian's shoulders like two heavy stones.
1:5:34|1:5:39|At this moment, he seemed to remember something and strode towards the tent.
1:5:39|1:5:44|Slowly, he started to run, as if using all his strength.
1:5:44|1:5:48|He ran over panting, tightly holding his own water bottle in his hand.
1:5:49|1:5:53|Lan Tian sat on the ground in a dignified manner, and he lifted the raincoat that was covering the entrance of the cave.
1:5:53|1:6:3|At that moment, he stood still, slowly picked up the small basin in the pit, looking at the empty cup, [Yang Liusong] feeling like a deflated balloon.
1:6:3|1:6:10|He lowered his head, sighed deeply, looked helplessly towards the distant sunset, and then dropped the cup in his hand.
1:6:10|1:6:15|The last rays of the setting sun cast a warm glow, turning the sky above into a blazing fire.
1:6:15|1:6:26|[Yang Liusong]'s back appeared in the frame, holding a cup to urinate into, collecting the urine in the cup, then raising the cup to look at it before lifting it to drink.
1:6:26|1:6:31|[Yang Liusong] didn't dare to drink too much at once, just took a small sip and stopped.
1:6:31|1:6:39|At night, [Yang Liusong] sat in the tent, turned on a flashlight, and rummaged through his backpack, but there was no surprising discovery inside.
1:6:39|1:6:43|[Yang Liusong] picked up the wallet placed aside and took out a 100 yuan bill.
1:6:43|1:6:54|In the dim light of the flashlight, [Yang Liusong] carefully examined the money, wondering if he was starting to regret not taking more money to buy some food.
1:6:54|1:7:0|Now, this essential item that everyone must have has become the most useless thing on the journey.
1:7:0|1:7:4|[Yang Liusong] raised his head and pondered for a moment, looking up at the sky with wide eyes.
1:7:12|1:7:22|He gazed with eager eyes, as if waiting for an answer from the heavens. But apart from the howling cold wind, silence quickly returned by his side.
1:7:23|1:7:29|Early the next morning, a [big wolf] quietly entered the tent and stared intently at the sleeping sheep.
1:7:29|1:7:36|Just then, Lan Tian woke up, its lips pale, staring at the huge creature in front of it.
1:7:36|1:7:41|[Big Wolf] turned its head away when it woke up, but its body remained very close.
1:7:41|1:7:44|Yang Liusong knew in his heart that even if he wanted to run now, it was already too late.
1:7:45|1:7:57|So he just lay there motionless, watching the [Big Wolf] in front of him. After a while, the [Big Wolf] showed no intention of attacking, but instead panted with its tongue out like a dog beside him.
1:7:57|1:8:3|He turned around and locked eyes with Lan Tian, then leisurely walked out of the tent.
1:8:3|1:8:13|Yang watched as [Lan Tian] walked away with his tail wagging, feeling a mix of emotions. Perhaps after spending many days together, they had transformed from being enemies to relying on each other as friends.
1:8:14|1:8:22|Or perhaps these wolves sensed his current hunger and cold, unwilling to miss out on the only meal on the desert.
1:8:22|1:8:28|The wolf's figure gradually faded into the distance, while the sheep inside the tent still lay there quietly.
1:8:28|1:8:35|Wearing a black knitted hat, his dark complexion formed a huge contrast with the pale and cracked lips at that moment.
1:8:35|1:8:37|The scene now returns to before the journey.
1:9:2|1:9:9|Sitting on the side, [Yang Liusong] immediately sat up straight, looking at her with concern.
1:9:9|1:9:13|Seeing the smile on [Lan Tian]'s face, [Yang Liusong] also smiled as he took the bottle of wine from her hand.
1:9:18|1:9:22|[Lan Tian] sighed softly after listening, and adjusted the blanket on his legs.
1:9:41|1:9:42|[Lan Tian] turns his head to the other side.
1:10:55|1:11:4|[Lan Tian] tilted his head, looked into [Yang Liusong]'s sincere eyes, nodded silently, and a large tear gathered in the corner of his eye, on the verge of falling.
1:11:37|1:11:46|Yang tilted his head back to drink from the cup, only to be choked and furrowed his brow.
1:11:46|1:11:47|The two sit by the lake.
1:11:55|1:12:2|The lake shimmered with a beautiful luster under the warm sunlight, like a flawless piece of jade.
1:12:26|1:12:30|[Yang Liusong] lowered his head without saying a word, while [Lan Tian] turned to look at him, her eyes filled with reluctance.
1:12:30|1:12:36|When Lan Tian saw Yang turn his head, he immediately looked away, unwilling to show his vulnerability.
1:12:36|1:12:40|Seeing the determined smile on [Lan Tian]'s face, [Yang Liusong] decided not to say anything more.
1:12:40|1:12:45|He unbuckled his seatbelt and got out of the car, taking out his own bicycle and luggage from the trunk.
1:12:46|1:12:53|Sitting in the car, [Lan Tian] listened to the movement behind the car, involuntarily observing every move of [Yang Liusong] from the rearview mirror.
1:12:53|1:13:0|Later, he bent down to fasten his safety belt, and at this moment, [Yang Liusong] had already ridden his bicycle to the window.
1:13:0|1:13:4|After staring at each other for a long time, [Lan Tian] raised his thumb and smiled at [Yang Liusong].
1:13:5|1:13:10|A gust of cold wind blew in, and the emotions of parting gradually welled up in their hearts.
1:13:10|1:13:15|Yang looked up, gazing into the distance, then turned to look at Lan Tian sitting in the car.
1:13:15|1:13:22|Later, he resolutely pushed his bicycle towards another fork in the road, immediately lifted his foot and sat on it, riding towards the path he had chosen.
1:13:23|1:13:31|Lan Tian caught a glimpse of the sheep gradually moving further away from him out of the corner of his eye, and then he dared to turn his head to watch his figure disappear.
1:13:31|1:13:39|Afterwards, he started the car and drove towards another opposite road, but his eyes were unwilling to move away from the back of the sheep even for a second.
1:13:39|1:13:46|Afterwards, [Lan Tian] simply parked the car by the roadside and silently watched the figure of Yang Liusong riding a bicycle.
1:13:46|1:13:51|The desolate mountain peaks are covered by sand and dust, with only the mountain top still retaining a patch of white snow.
1:13:52|1:13:58|On the wide road, Lan Tian lowered his head and pedaled his bicycle hard, his breath visible in the cold air.
1:13:58|1:14:4|He looked up at the road ahead, but his mind was already in a mess.
1:14:4|1:14:10|At this moment, Yang couldn't help but look back, only to see Lan Tian's car parked in place, unmoving.
1:14:10|1:14:19|In the car, [Lan Tian] saw the way Yang turned back and smiled with relief, but soon, the pain of parting swept over [Lan Tian]'s whole body.
1:14:19|1:14:26|He lowered his head, placed his hands on the steering wheel, and reminisced about the days they had spent together over the past few days.
1:14:35|1:14:39|[Lan Tian] couldn't help but start sobbing as she thought about it.
1:14:39|1:14:43|But at this moment, a knocking sound suddenly came from the car window.
1:14:43|1:14:46|He suddenly lifted his head and found [Yang Liusong] standing outside.
1:14:47|1:14:52|Immediately, he rolled down the car window and looked in astonishment at the panting [Yang Liusong].
1:14:52|1:14:59|The sunlight above the head pierced through the mountain peaks, illuminating the dark and damp mountain slope, with a faint light floating in the air.
1:14:59|1:15:3|At this moment, [Yang Liusong] appeared on the hillside with [Lan Tian] on his back.
1:15:3|1:15:9|At this moment, [Lan Tian] obediently lay on [Yang Liusong]'s back, wearing a knitted hat and tightly hugging his neck.
1:15:9|1:15:13|[Yang Liusong] carefully watched the deer beneath his feet, exhaling puffs of hot air.
1:15:23|1:15:42|[Yang Liusong] bent down and moved [Lan Tian], who was about to slip, upwards. He then continued to walk forward, panting heavily. After only a few steps, [Yang Liusong] stopped again, deliberately let out a long sigh. This made [Lan Tian] on his back laugh, and he raised his arms and cheered loudly, expressing his joy.
1:15:42|1:16:3|Yang had to bend down again, adjusted his posture, and then shouted towards the hillside. Soon, the two arrived at the best spot on the hillside, with [Lan Tian] sitting in front of the tent waving a prayer flag, while [Yang Liusong] was squatting on the ground adjusting the camera. In the evening, the silhouettes of the two sitting side by side appeared on the hillside.
1:16:3|1:16:9|They looked up at the twinkling stars in the sky, enjoying the warmth of each other's company at this moment.
1:16:9|1:16:17|The flashback ended, [Yang Liusong] turned on the light revealing a dark face, then quickly turned it off, with the voice of [Lan Tian] echoing in his ears.
1:16:39|1:16:58|[Yang Liusong] woke up in a daze once again, it was already the next morning. His face, weathered by wind and sun, had started to peel in large patches. His severely dehydrated lips were covered with dry skin. Slowly, he picked up the cup beside him and stared at the sparse urine inside, lost in thought.
1:17:5|1:17:16|The extreme lack of water in the body quickly dispelled any wandering thoughts. [Yang Liusong] took out the clip that had fallen into his mouth, but at this moment, his inner struggle began again.
1:17:16|1:17:20|Soon, his eyes suddenly lit up as if he had remembered something.
1:17:20|1:17:24|He then struggled to sit up, gazing at the water cup with a lizard-like intensity.
1:17:24|1:17:29|The strong desire to survive broke his last bit of stubbornness.
1:17:29|1:17:34|[Yang Liusong] stared at the water source that could save his life with a dull and intense look.
1:17:34|1:17:38|At this moment, he reached out without any hesitation and grabbed the cup lid.
1:17:38|1:17:42|With the movement of the fingers, the lid of the cup also starts to turn and is soon opened.
1:17:43|1:17:55|Looking at the small amount of urine in the cup, [Yang Liusong] felt the fire in his throat and couldn't help but salivate. He brought the cup closer to his lips, but the strange smell caused discomfort in his body.
1:17:55|1:18:12|After a bout of retching, [Yang Liusong] struggled to swallow the acidic water rising in his stomach. Taking a deep breath, he gradually calmed his rapid breathing. Looking at the urine in the cup, a strong odor hit him. With no choice, he held his breath and immediately drank it down.
1:18:21|1:18:28|[Yang Liusong]'s most cherished source of water was unexpectedly vomited out due to uncontrollable factors.
1:18:28|1:18:34|He had just closed his eyes to take a break, but the blood on the ground instantly woke him up.
1:18:34|1:18:38|[Yang Liusong] turned his head and looked around, unable to believe his eyes for a moment.
1:19:12|1:19:19|Looking around at the snow-covered plains and mountains, the flame of hope that had been extinguished was once again ignited.
1:19:44|1:19:53|At this moment, [Yang Liusong] felt his whole body filled with vitality, riding his bicycle in the snow, shouting with joy.
1:19:53|1:20:6|In the distance, the deer grazing in fear, constantly moving their ears to observe. As far as the eye can see, there is an endless expanse of snow, with sparse patches of grass only revealing themselves at this moment.
1:20:6|1:20:14|[Yang Liusong] has packed up his belongings, climbed onto the road that cuts through the barrel, and the bicycle tires left crooked marks on the ground.
1:20:14|1:20:17|The back view of [Yang Liusong] riding a bicycle has become more heroic.
1:20:17|1:20:23|In front, the short white snow-capped peaks pierce the sky, with precious treasures like blue sand lingering in the air.
1:20:23|1:20:28|These days of hardship have left [Yang Liusong] with a feeling of having a second chance at life.
1:20:57|1:21:18|Time flies, today marks the fifty-fifth day in Hengchuan Qiangtang. Lan Tian is currently at an altitude of 4,998 meters. He shakes his wet clothes a couple of times and hangs them on the ground nearby. Then he sits down, rolls up his pants, and suddenly a stream of water rushes down from above.
1:21:18|1:21:21|Yang Liusong, with his back turned, paid no attention at all.
1:21:21|1:21:31|The water flow became faster and faster, until it reached [Yang Liusong]'s feet. He suddenly stood up, quickly turned around, and threw the luggage that had already been soaked in water to the other side.
1:21:32|1:21:51|On the side, the bicycle was still lying on the ground. [Yang Liusong] strode over to the bicycle, and caught sight of the tent soaking in the water. He immediately turned around, picked up the tent, and threw it onto the dry ground. Then, he ran back to the bicycle and lifted it up from the ground.
1:21:51|1:21:55|Immediately grab the handrail and walk towards the relatively dry bank.
1:21:55|1:22:2|Thinking everything was fine, [Yang Liusong] lowered his head to look around and realized that the clothes he had just hung out to dry were wet again.
1:22:17|1:22:22|The flood on the Gobi Desert spread particularly fast, with no shelter around.
1:22:22|1:22:28|[Yang Jingwo] took a difficult step forward on his bicycle, with the water already up to his waist.
1:22:28|1:22:35|He tried hard to lift the bicycle and move forward, but his body couldn't move against the resistance of the water.
1:22:35|1:22:41|[Yang] leaned forward stubbornly, pushed hard, and his legs gave way, causing him to fall backwards.
1:22:41|1:22:48|The bicycle, with luggage attached, also fell down. [Yang] had to drag the bicycle with great effort, struggling towards the shore.
1:22:56|1:23:6|The overflowing melted snow turned the vast desert into a rushing river, and the helpless [Yang] was rapidly retreating in the direction of the flowing river.
1:23:6|1:23:15|At this moment, the water has already passed his shoulders, [Yang] had to stretch his hand upwards with effort, dragging the car to accelerate towards the shore.
1:23:15|1:23:21|Hard work pays off, and a few hours later, [Yang] finally arrived at a place where the water flow was relatively calm.
1:23:22|1:23:28|He sat exhausted on the wheel of his bicycle, looking up and taking a deep breath.
1:23:28|1:23:34|After a short rest, Lan Tian stood up, struggled to lift his bicycle, and slowly walked towards the shore.
1:23:34|1:23:45|Not long after, he safely reached the river bank. Exhausted, [Yang] casually pushed his bicycle aside and collapsed, lying flat on the shore. However, cries for help from wolf cubs could be heard from across the river.
1:23:58|1:24:12|Yang turned around and saw the pitiful look of Lan Tian, the big wolf, feeling a bit sorry for him. He got up and looked at the rushing water around him, feeling even more headache. At night, a bright moon hung in the sky, emitting a cold and eerie light.
1:24:12|1:24:21|Curled up in the tent, Lan Tian had a small kerosene lamp lit at his feet. He kept rubbing his feet and legs with his hands, shivering all over.
1:24:21|1:24:28|The emergency light above emitted a faint glow, looking up ahead as if pondering something.
1:24:28|1:24:33|He then turned his eyes to the windproof bag on the side, which contained half a bag of blood.
1:24:33|1:24:37|He couldn't help but reach out and pick it up, slowly moving it to his side.
1:24:54|1:25:1|[Yang Liusong] opened the wind pocket and glanced inside, then looked ahead and stopped his hand movements.
1:25:1|1:25:7|After much contemplation, the last line of defense in his heart was finally defeated by the trivialities of the day.
1:25:7|1:25:13|Lan Tian slowly reached into the bag, carefully grabbed a small handful of blood, and opened his mouth to eat it.
1:25:24|1:25:41|After eating a bite, Lan Tian gradually lost control, reaching out to grab handfuls after handfuls, continuously stuffing them into his mouth.
1:25:41|1:26:4|Despite being choked and coughing continuously, the sheep's mouth kept chewing. The pleasure of eating brought the sheep an unprecedented satisfaction, but soon, its eyes gradually dimmed, and the chewing slowed down. It gradually realized a serious problem.
1:26:4|1:26:9|The next morning, [Yang Liusong] was in the tent, holding a compressed biscuit in his hand.
1:26:10|1:26:25|Bowing his head and quickly devouring the food, eating voraciously, even licking the crumbs in his hand clean, but soon, his expression changed, raising his hand to fan his mouth.
1:26:25|1:26:28|[Yang Liusong] sat in place, full of regret, but unable to control his body.
1:26:34|1:26:39|Outside the tent, the flood surged with a menacing warning sound.
1:26:39|1:26:49|In the highland Gobi where [Yang Liusong] is located, there is only a small space left for setting up tents. If they stay in place without moving, they will soon face the risk of being washed away.
1:26:49|1:27:1|[Yang Liusong] squatted on the side for a while, immediately took off his pants, carried the big and small bags, and slowly walked towards the rolling river. He was seen holding two trekking poles, stepping cautiously and carefully with each step.
1:27:2|1:27:11|In the middle of the river, the water flow became more and more turbulent. [Yang Liusong]'s lower body was completely soaked in the water, and the backpacks on his body were all destined to be submerged by the water.
1:27:12|1:27:19|Every step in the water was exceptionally difficult, and [Yang Liusong]'s expression began to look fierce due to exerting too much force.
1:27:19|1:27:24|The next moment, it was washed back by the water flow because it didn't stand firm.
1:27:24|1:27:33|A few hours later, [Yang Liusong]'s figure reappeared in the waves, with the front of the bike on his shoulder, striding forward against the current.
1:27:39|1:27:53|At this moment, [Yang Liusong], who successfully reached the opposite bank, put on a down jacket and anxiously rubbed his exposed thighs with his hands, unable to stop moving in place, while [Big Wolf] let out a lonely whimper in the original spot.
1:27:53|1:27:59|[Yang Liusong] took a glance at the [Big Wolf] that had been with him for days, sighed, gritted his teeth, and took off his down jacket again.
1:28:10|1:28:15|Soon, [Yang Liusong] had packed up his belongings and was walking on the high ground untouched by the flood.
1:28:15|1:28:18|The Big Wolf obediently followed behind him.
1:28:18|1:28:24|At this moment, [Yang Liusong] suddenly turned and looked at [Big Wolf].
1:28:24|1:28:28|The Big Wolf took a few steps back in fear after hearing it, but still kept staring at him.
1:28:28|1:28:33|[Yang Liusong] gave him a white look, then turned around and pushed his bicycle forward.
1:28:33|1:28:36|The naive little wolf slowed down and secretly followed behind him.
1:28:37|1:28:43|[Yang Liusong] quickened his pace and the wolf cub following behind also hurried to speed up.
1:28:43|1:28:46|Suddenly, a dark shadow swept over [Yang Liusong]'s head.
1:28:46|1:28:52|Yang Liusong looked up in confusion and saw an eagle circling in the sky.
1:28:52|1:28:56|It looked back at [Xiao Lang], but at that moment, an eagle swooped down.
1:28:56|1:29:0|Sensing the danger, [Little Wolf] hurriedly ran back.
1:29:0|1:29:3|Yang pushed the car and quickly picked up a few stones to throw at the eagle.
1:29:11|1:29:17|The eagle was scared away, and the sheep looked at the frightened [wolf cub] with some sympathy.
1:29:17|1:29:23|[Little Wolf] saw it stop and no longer felt afraid, obediently lying down on the ground, tilting its head to look at it.
1:29:23|1:29:26|Time passes by in the blink of an eye, it goes fast and comes fast too.
1:29:26|1:29:33|Today marks the sixty-fourth day of Lan Tian's expedition into the uninhabited area, with an altitude of 4,997 meters.
1:29:33|1:29:38|At this moment, [Xiao Lang] is running around the sheep, biting the straps of its backpack and playing foolishly.
1:29:50|1:29:58|With a worried look on his face, [Yang Liusong] plays with his son, [Little Wolf], who sensibly walks away. He then walks alone to the nearby grassland, occasionally looking into the distance.
1:29:59|1:30:12|A mole suddenly popped out of the hole on the side, timid Lan Tian immediately ran backwards. The two moles on the ground hugged each other in a stalemate, even stood up together, trying to show their abilities.
1:30:12|1:30:17|Both of them were holding each other's napes tightly, not daring to relax at all.
1:30:17|1:30:25|[Little Wolf] wanted to watch the excitement, but ended up being scared of the groundhog peeking out. He had to quickly run back towards the tent set up by [Yang Liusong] with a mix of excitement.
1:30:25|1:30:28|At this moment, [Yang Liusong] sat on the ground, gazing ahead.
1:31:2|1:31:13|[Yang Liusong] pushes a bicycle loaded with stuff, while [Little Wolf] obediently stays in the backpack with just a little head peeking out. In the distance, a group of camels curiously stare at the passing [Yang Liusong].
1:31:13|1:31:22|In the vast desert, variously shaped mounds and small hills stand tall, giving the barren land a sense of vast and magnificent beauty when viewed from above.
1:31:22|1:31:24|Yang Liusong's figure is enveloped in this picturesque scenery.
1:31:25|1:31:31|Slowly moving forward, the path is littered with the corpses of yaks, which is quite frightening.
1:31:31|1:31:37|Today is the 65th day of the journey, and the altitude is 4987 meters.
1:31:37|1:31:47|[Yang Liusong] knelt by the shore, gently scooping up a cup of water, but it still looked murky. He frowned, his face showing a hint of blue. At that moment, [Lan Tian] on the side suddenly howled.
1:31:52|1:32:7|[Yang Liusong] felt something was wrong, he looked up at the sea, and what he saw made his pupils dilate gradually. A wall of dark clouds connected the sky and the earth, and a spiral water column rose from the sea. At this moment, the tornado's speed of movement became faster and faster, heading straight towards the coast.
1:32:8|1:32:20|[Yang Liusong] stood still, his eyes following the direction of the tornado as it moved. A huge rotating funnel formed by the water waves was roaring towards the center, sweeping up the sand and wind from the shore.
1:32:20|1:32:39|[Yang Liusong] stood still, watching the incredibly destructive force of the massive tornado. Suddenly, he remembered his tent and bicycle behind him being blown away in an instant. However, the tornado had already come upon him like a bolt from the blue. Frantically, [Yang Liusong] tried to speed up, but he could only watch helplessly as his belongings were sucked into the vortex.
1:32:40|1:32:45|Before he could react, the massive tornado rushed towards [Yang Liusong] in a frenzy.
1:32:48|1:32:55|Despite the sandstorm raised by Lan Tian obscuring his vision, Yang Liusong still exerted all his efforts and ran forward with all his might.
1:32:55|1:33:1|Soon, [Yang Liusong] was engulfed by the swirling yellow sandstorm.
1:33:1|1:33:6|[Yang Liusong] loses consciousness, at this moment, it's as if he's falling into the deep sea, slowly sinking to the bottom.
1:33:7|1:33:15|The faint light above his head gradually dimmed, and at that moment, he subconsciously recalled the day he bid farewell to Lan Tian.
1:33:15|1:33:23|Sitting in the car, [Lan Tian] rolled down the window and smiled at him. The setting sun in front of them shone brightly, reflecting on his handsome face.
1:33:23|1:33:30|[Yang Liusong] stood in front of the car window, looking at her with reluctance, but his throat seemed to be blocked and he couldn't say a word.
1:33:30|1:33:38|[Lan Tian] stared at her for a long time, then picked up the camera next to her and dropped it, while [Yang Liusong] looked down at the camera in silence.
1:33:44|1:33:48|[Yang Liusong] holds the camera in his hands, with guidance from [Lan Tian].
1:33:51|1:33:56|[Lan Tian] expressed her concern in a gentle way, causing a warm feeling to surge in [Yang Liusong]'s heart.
1:33:56|1:34:1|He smiled at Lan Tian and then rode his bike towards the direction of the shooting range.
1:34:1|1:34:6|Sitting in the car, [Lan Tian] clasped her hands together, closing her eyes in worry as she prayed.
1:34:6|1:34:12|[Yang Liusong] gradually moved further and further away, as [Lan Tian] watched his back and squeezed out a smile.
1:34:24|1:34:29|At this moment, the sheep about to fall into the sea seemed to hear the call from [Lan Tian]'s heart.
1:34:29|1:34:35|It stretches its arms vigorously, swimming upwards continuously towards the bright spot above its head with all its might.
1:34:35|1:34:41|The scene shifts back to the real world, the familiar vast desert reappears before their eyes.
1:34:41|1:34:44|Yang Liusong lay face down, motionless in the sand.
1:34:44|1:34:52|After a while, Lan Tian gradually regained consciousness, rolled over and got up from the ground, with sand constantly spilling out from his clothes and backpack.
1:34:53|1:34:58|He squinted and turned to look back, only to see Lan Tian not far away, staring at him intently.
1:35:8|1:35:16|As dusk approached, the sky suddenly darkened, and a group of wild horses in the distance seemed to be constantly running forward as if being chased.
1:35:16|1:35:22|Outside the continuous hills, a group of yaks are queuing up to move towards another higher hill.
1:35:22|1:35:26|The eyes are filled with golden sand everywhere you look.
1:35:27|1:35:38|Countless folds of sand and stones surged up like frozen waves, extending all the way to the distant horizon where they met the sky, making it impossible to imagine where the end of the sand was.
1:35:38|1:35:42|Without change, Lan Tian still closely follows behind the sheep.
1:35:57|1:36:15|The wild geese call out as they fly through the sky, heading towards the distant freedom. Exhausted, Lan Tian lies on the ground, looking at the vast sky. The surrounding area, washed away by the flood, has turned into a muddy swamp. Lan Tian's eyes are hollow, unsure if she can still walk out of this desolate land.
1:36:15|1:36:19|His face became even darker and rougher due to the blowing of the wind and sand.
1:36:19|1:36:23|Only one trekking pole left, tightly gripped in his hand.
1:36:23|1:36:27|At this moment, the hungry [sheep] began to feel their heartbeats quicken.
1:36:30|1:36:31|The scene then shifts to the inn.
1:36:32|1:36:41|[Lan Tian] sat in a wheelchair, looking at a map with a route crossing through Qiangtang, estimating it would take around 80 days.
1:36:41|1:36:48|[Yang Liusong] is going through something at this moment, and [Lan Tian] has no idea. All he can do is silently pray for the day when [Yang Liusong] returns safely.
1:36:54|1:37:1|Today is the 69th day of crossing through Qiangtang, at an altitude of 5428 meters.
1:37:1|1:37:12|[Yang] appeared at the edge of the sandy cliff, leaning on a trekking pole and limping. The cliff revealed neat horizontal stripes, showcasing the incredible craftsmanship of nature.
1:37:13|1:37:17|The big wolf cub then revealed its head, staring at Lan Tian behind Yang.
1:37:17|1:37:21|Under the thin ice on the river, several fish were swimming around freely.
1:37:21|1:37:30|[Yang] lay on the side, holding a stone in his hand, pounding the ice surface again and again.
1:37:30|1:37:35|The faint thumping sound sent the fish in the sea scattering in fear.
1:37:35|1:37:42|[Yang Liusong] still maintained his original posture, continuously striking the ice surface, paying no attention to the ice chips splashing all over his face.
1:37:54|1:37:59|[Yang Liusong] was so exhausted that he had no strength left to lift the stone.
1:37:59|1:38:6|He tried to clear away the falling ice debris with his hands, only to find that his efforts were futile against the thick ice layer.
1:38:6|1:38:10|[Little Wolf] stood aside, whimpering pitifully.
1:38:10|1:38:18|Reluctantly, [Yang Liusong] had to set off again with [Xiao Lang], only to be greeted by an even steeper downhill slope after climbing over the hill.
1:38:18|1:38:23|[Yang Liusong] leaned on his trekking pole, moving his feet slowly to the side.
1:38:23|1:38:29|The wolf cub stayed peacefully in the backpack, swaying back and forth with Lan Tian's trembling body.
1:38:29|1:38:34|[Yang Liusong], who hadn't eaten for days, felt like he was walking on cotton and couldn't muster any strength in his feet.
1:38:34|1:38:40|It stumbled for a moment and then clumsily tumbled down the hillside.
1:38:40|1:38:42|The scene before their eyes once again brought despair.
1:38:43|1:38:48|The endless desert, as far as the eye can see, reappeared as if copied and pasted.
1:38:48|1:38:58|On the seventy-fourth day of crossing through Qiangtang, at an altitude of 4557 meters, [Yang Liusong] squinted his eyes and looked ahead with his dry mouth open.
1:38:58|1:39:4|It could no longer hold on, and knelt down on the ground. [Big Wolf] stuck out its tongue and panted, also silently stopping.
1:39:4|1:39:9|A gust of cold wind blew by, making the hair scattered on both sides even more disheveled.
1:39:9|1:39:19|[Yang Liusong] licked his chapped lips and occasionally lifted his heavy eyelids to look ahead, while the cute little wolf cub rubbed against his sleeve coquettishly.
1:39:19|1:39:23|[Yang Liusong] reached out and held him in his arms, gently embracing him.
1:39:24|1:39:28|The wolf cub happily licked the lamb's wrist, stuck out its tongue, and panted with hot breath.
1:39:28|1:39:36|Yang Liusong lowered his head to look at the wolf cub, his eyes suddenly becoming unusually determined, with layers of sand flows scattered in the boundless desert.
1:39:36|1:39:41|With their strong perseverance, they manage to survive in the harsh desert environment where their roots are deeply embedded in the sandy soil.
1:39:42|1:39:47|[Yang Liusong] no longer hesitated, stood up with his trekking pole, and set off again.
1:39:47|1:39:54|The darkness wiped away the last trace of the setting sun, and the night fell like a curtain in a theater.
1:39:54|1:40:4|[Yang Liusong] used an electric baton to ignite a patch of willows. In the flickering firelight, his face became alternately bright and dark. From a distance, [Big Wolf] watched the burning willows with a hint of curiosity.
1:40:5|1:40:15|For days of starvation had left him dizzy and disoriented, as he turned to look at the young wolf in front of the fire, a terrible desire arose within him.
1:40:15|1:40:23|On the seventy-fifth day, [Lan Tian] was leaning on a trekking pole, slowly making his way towards the towering sand dunes.
1:40:23|1:40:28|He was exhausted, his legs gave out and he knelt on the sandy ground, gasping for breath.
1:40:28|1:40:35|[Little Wolf] saw it and immediately ran over, making a whimpering sound of distress, but [Lan Tian] picked up a climbing stick and hit him.
1:40:57|1:41:4|A gust of cold wind blew, lifting the fine sand on the ground. [Lan Tian] continued to support herself with the trekking pole, trembling as she walked forward.
1:41:4|1:41:9|[Lan Tian] ignored its violent obstruction and continued to follow closely behind.
1:41:9|1:41:17|As the sun sets, countless sand and stones surge up, the folds resembling solidified waves, extending all the way to the distant horizon.
1:41:17|1:41:20|At this moment, the shadows of a pack of wolves appeared on the mountain peaks behind them.
1:41:40|1:41:48|Yang, hungry for days and nights, dragged his almost falling apart body slower and slower, with the [Big Wolf] silently following beside him.
1:41:48|1:41:59|On the 76th day of the journey, at an altitude of 4550 meters, Lan Tian could no longer hold on. He collapsed with his head down, gradually losing consciousness.
1:41:59|1:42:2|Twinkling stars of the Milky Way appear in Lan Tian's mind.
1:42:3|1:42:12|At this moment, he felt a warmth in his hand, and he opened his eyes drowsily to see a slender hand gently interlocking fingers with his index finger.
1:42:12|1:42:21|Yang couldn't help but turn his head and look to the side, only to find Lan Tian holding his hand and lying beside him, with a warm smile on her face.
1:42:21|1:42:27|Lying on the side, Lan Tian looked at the familiar face with a trance, at this moment, he felt choked up and couldn't say a word.
1:42:28|1:42:36|[Lan Tian], dressed in unusual attire, smiled at her and then turned to look at the Milky Way scattered across the sky.
1:42:36|1:42:42|Soon, her eyes became extremely sorrowful, then she took a deep breath and said.
1:43:46|1:43:51|[Lan Tian]'s eyes were shining when speaking, with a gaze that exuded a longing for freedom.
1:43:51|1:43:57|He looked up at the starry sky above, then a smile of relief appeared at the corner of his mouth.
1:44:1|1:44:6|He then closed his eyes contentedly, accompanied by the warmth in his hands.
1:44:6|1:44:10|Lan Tian on the side opened his arms, with a happy smile on his face.
1:44:10|1:44:25|The two figures holding hands lying under the brilliant Milky Way gradually became farther and farther away, and the scene gradually plunged into darkness.
1:44:25|1:44:34|In just a moment, dark clouds covered the sky, lightning bolts struck from the sky, as if there was a momentum to devour the heavens and the earth.
1:44:34|1:44:38|[Little Wolf] was awakened by the rumbling thunder, then quickly tilted his head and fell back asleep.
1:44:45|1:44:54|A group of wolves ran towards them like mad, while the sheep lying on the ground remained motionless.
1:44:54|1:45:0|Sensing something unusual, Lan Tian immediately woke up, but Yang Liusong, holding the whistle, still had no response.
1:45:0|1:45:3|He ran to the sheep in a hurry, trying to wake it up.
1:45:35|1:45:41|In the early morning, the sand dunes remained silent as usual under the sunlight, vast and endless.
1:45:41|1:46:2|After billions of years of precipitation and tribulations, he calmly watched all the changes and the flow of narratives, transcending the world, as the grains of sand under the scorching sun emitted a hint of heat. He also looked out, as if the yellow sand beneath his feet was drifting with a faint and continuous heat wave, the struggle against the harsh cold and hunger in the desert for seventy-seven days.
1:46:2|1:46:9|Before stepping into this unpredictable land, he had no idea if this would be a journey of no return.
1:46:10|1:46:14|In front of the inn, [Lan Tian] sat in a wheelchair, as if she had been waiting for a long time.
1:46:14|1:46:25|He was dressed in a straightjacket, stood up from the wheelchair, walked out of the door and stood on the steps. The sunlight shone on his bright face, but he couldn't help but raise his hand to shield it.
1:46:25|1:46:31|As the camera zooms in, he slowly reaches out his other hand, bends down, and reveals a sweet smile.
1:46:32|1:46:46|The sunlight gradually warms up, touching everything in the world, and the wind in the sky also starts to become gentle, no longer carrying the infinite chill as it brushes past, and [Lan Tian]'s face gradually disappears under the brilliance of the sun.
1:46:46|1:46:54|In the lingering sunset glow, the figure of [Lan Tian] leaping and bounding gradually emerges, with [Yang Liusong] watching him, leaning on a trekking pole and jumping backwards.
1:46:55|1:47:2|His flowing medium-length hair was blown behind his ears, and the sand dust on the ground kept rising with his every step.
1:47:2|1:47:9|Later, he lay on the sandy ground covered with willow bushes, holding [Xiao Lang] in his arms, pouting his mouth, pretending to howl.
1:47:9|1:47:20|[Little Wolf] at this moment became interested, vigorously lifting his head and opening his mouth wide, letting out a heart-wrenching howl, a howl filled with sorrow, while [Yang Liusong] had a look of relief on his face.
1:47:21|1:47:27|In 2010, [Yang Liusong] attempted to hike the uninhabited Hengchuan Qiangtang area for the first time.
1:47:27|1:47:34|In 2014, [Li Congming] went missing while in the Hengchuan Qiangtang uninhabited area, during the Keke Xili music and dance pot event.
1:47:34|1:47:40|In 2016, Lan Tian completed the Hengchuan route in the Qiangtang Wilderness for the first time in 52 days.
1:47:41|1:47:46|One person, one bicycle, one tent, crossing the Qiangtang Plateau for seventy-seven days.
