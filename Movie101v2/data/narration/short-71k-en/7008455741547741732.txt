0:1:16|0:1:24|[Chen Jing]'s daughter [Chen Xiaoxin] walked towards the restaurant in her school uniform. The mother and daughter sat at the table, with [Chen Jing] pouring milk for her daughter while talking.
0:1:28|0:1:35|The daughter finished breakfast and was about to leave. After a few steps, she returned and took a bag from the coffee table.
0:1:44|0:2:6|[Chen Jing]'s conversation with her daughter could be heard through the poorly soundproofed wall by [Shi Hong]. After finishing washing up in the bathroom, he calmly dressed in front of the mirror. When the voices from the next room disappeared, [Shi Hong] chuckled lightly, then opened the door and walked out. The old residential building was crowded with people, with red bricks exposed and wrinkled walls covered in various small advertisements.
0:2:6|0:2:29|[Shi Hong], with a single-shoulder bag on his left shoulder, walked down the stairs of the residential building, heading towards the backlight. He left the sparsely populated alley and walked onto the main street, then descended the circular staircase on the overpass. Under the overpass, pedestrians were coming and going, with a few breakfast stalls parked on the side. [Shi Hong] walked forward expressionlessly, with a white-haired beggar sitting on the roadside steps.
0:2:29|0:2:35|A man in a suit bends down and puts coins into the beggar's bowl.
0:2:37|0:2:43|The beggar thanked the man in the suit while extending his bowl towards [Shi Hong] who was approaching, but [Shi Hong] completely ignored him and walked away.
0:2:43|0:2:51|On the other side of the bridge, two vagrants are sitting by the edge counting garbage. Walking out of the bridge tunnel, [Shi Hong] arrives at the Xinxin Snack Bar, where [Chen Jing] is serving customers.
0:3:1|0:3:25|[Chen Jing] turned around to get the meal set, [Shi Hong] lowered his head to take the bag and walked away, his gaze somewhat evasive. [Chen Jing] looked at the back of [Shi Hong] thoughtfully, [Shi Hong] carried the fast food slowly towards Jiangbei Yucai Middle School, surrounded by students in school uniforms. He slightly hunched his back, stood facing the students at the platform, writing on the blackboard and reading aloud.
0:3:25|0:3:31|The students below were chattering and playing around, but no one paid any attention to them.
0:3:32|0:3:42|[Shi Hong] The classroom where [Chen Jing] teaches is noisy, while [Chen Xiaoxin], [Chen Jing]'s daughter, is currently in a music classroom at another school, leading her classmates in playing the oboe under the conductor's guidance.
0:3:46|0:4:5|Outside the snack shop, [Chen Jing] is receiving a delivery. She takes the delivery slip from the delivery guy, signs it with thanks, then picks up the goods on the ground and walks into the shop. Not far away, a man with medium-length hair stands on the steps, hands in his pockets, staring intently at [Chen Jing] moving the goods. As night falls, the whole residential building appears very quiet.
0:4:5|0:4:32|In the corridor, the incandescent light brought a small piece of brightness to the dark night. After work, [Shi Hong] was sitting by the desk lamp writing something. He flipped through the papers in his hand, the table was covered with books, and the blackboard next to it was filled with dense mathematical formulas. Next door, [Chen Jing] was ironing clothes at home. Just then, the man with medium-length hair who had been watching [Chen Jing] during the day arrived at [Chen Jing]'s doorstep, stood still, and rang the doorbell.
0:4:35|0:4:43|[Shi Hong] put down the pen and listened to the movement next door.
0:4:49|0:5:12|The man with medium-length hair remained silent, continuously pressing the doorbell. [Chen Jing] hesitated for a moment inside the house, then raised her hand to open the door. On the other side, [Shi Hong] seemed lost in thought, looking down at a draft paper in his hand. The equations on the paper suddenly split into letters and symbols, darting around chaotically. The camera rapidly zoomed into the paper, and suddenly a blood-red "x" appeared in the center.
0:5:12|0:5:17|The title "The Devotion of Suspect X" appears on the screen.
0:5:17|0:5:23|As the day breaks, Associate Professor Tang Chuan, the senior consultant of the Provincial Public Security Department, is giving a lecture in the staircase classroom of the Jiangbei Police Academy.
0:5:46|0:6:0|The people listening to the lecture started whispering to each other. At this moment, two male assistants pushed two machines onto the stage. The machine on the left was full of small holes, while the one on the right had a piece of glass on top. With a push of a switch by the assistants, the glass vibrated a few times and then shattered on the ground.
0:6:1|0:6:9|The audience in the class started to stir, [Tang Chuan] nodded to his assistant to push away the two machines, then pointed with his left hand at the screen and began to explain.
0:6:27|0:6:33|The animation on the screen begins to demonstrate the car crash process just described by [Tang Chuan].
0:6:49|0:6:55|After class, [Tang Chuan] walked out with his bag, followed closely by the detective [Luo Miao].
0:7:43|0:8:6|[罗淼] glanced at his phone, handed the sandwich to him, then turned and ran. [Tang Chuan] picked up the sandwich, looked at it, smiled helplessly, and then left. The embankment under the bridge was crowded with people. Following their directions, a fence was seen erected along the riverbank. Two forensic doctors and several police officers were standing inside, with a naked body lying in the middle. Not far away, a bald man was being questioned by [Luo Miao].
0:8:39|0:8:49|The captain, accompanied by [Luo Miao] and another young detective, arrived at the body. [Dr. Niu] turned the body over, which was severely decomposed and unrecognizable. The young detective couldn't help but retch.
0:9:30|0:9:49|Captain Tang Chuan stood with his hands behind his back, contemplating for a few seconds over the body on the ground. He then turned and walked away. Luo Miao looked back at the captain as he left, then frowned at the body. Not long after, he and several police officers, along with a police dog, found a fallen bicycle under a bridge not far away.
0:11:0|0:11:17|[Luo Miao] picked up the file of [Chen Jing] and then took the young detective to [Chen Jing]'s house. [Chen Jing] quickly opened the door, [Luo Miao] showed his credentials, and then walked around [Chen Jing]'s house to observe. [Chen Jing] closed the door and turned around, asking,
0:11:53|0:12:4|[Chen Xiaoxin] walked out with her head down, poured a glass of water, then walked back without looking up. [Chen Jing] kept her eyes on her daughter, while [Luo Miao] glanced at [Chen Xiaoxin] before shifting her focus back to [Chen Jing].
0:12:43|0:13:4|Chen Jing put down her bag, took out a small booklet from the nearby small bamboo basket, walked to Luo Miao's side, handed the booklet to him. Luo Miao stood up, took the booklet, and found it was a promotional booklet for a cartoon movie. He casually flipped through it, only to discover two movie ticket stubs inside. Luo Miao glanced at the detective next to him, then bid farewell and left.
0:13:5|0:13:15|They were about to leave when they saw [Shi Hong] coming back from work. They watched as he walked past them with a slight hunch, head down and body slightly turned. [Luo Miao] and the detective next to her both stopped and turned to look at [Shi Hong].
0:13:46|0:14:5|As soon as the words fell, [Shi Hong] ignored the police officer next to him, turned and walked into the room. [Luo Miao] and the police officer beside him had to leave. The light in the next room was dim, [Chen Jing] was wiping the table, the two glasses of water previously poured were still there. Her expression was hidden in the messy hair, somewhat unclear, but the whole person seemed to be burdened with heavy thoughts.
0:14:5|0:14:20|In the late night alley, with only a few passersby, [Shi Hong], who had just entered the house not long ago, came down from upstairs. He walked to the public telephone, picked up the receiver with his left hand, inserted the phone card with his right hand, dialed a number, and it was unclear who he was calling.
0:14:20|0:14:37|The sun slowly rose, and [Tang Chuan] arrived at the Jiangbei Police Academy's Criminal Science and Technology Laboratory early in the morning with a handbag. After greeting the students, [Tang Chuan] walked into the laboratory and saw [Luo Miao] observing the ultrasonic generator on the table.
0:16:14|0:16:21|[Tang Chuan] operated the experimental equipment while talking to [Luo Miao]. After a moment of silence, [Luo Miao] suddenly walked towards a courier.
0:16:32|0:16:43|Upon hearing Luo Miao's words, Tang Chuan held a coffee cup with a look of surprise on his face. His mind immediately went back to his childhood, with a young Tang Chuan and the rest of the students finishing the exam, tidying up their stationery, and getting ready to leave.
0:16:49|0:16:58|The invigilator teacher raised a test paper with a colorful map on it in anger, the students looked at each other in astonishment. Suddenly, the teacher pointed to the corner where a boy was writing something with his head down and scolded,
0:17:5|0:17:15|The young [Shi Hong] looked expressionless at the teacher and then lowered his head. Nearby, [Tang Chuan] smiled as he watched him. After class, [Tang Chuan] walked up to [Shi Hong] and said,
0:17:50|0:18:14|[Shi Hong] finished speaking and then lowered his head again. [Tang Chuan] took the notebook from [Shi Hong] and started reading, becoming more and more fascinated. With a pen in his right hand in a writing position, [Shi Hong] glanced at the engrossed [Tang Chuan], his smile growing bigger. [Tang Chuan] also looked at him, and the two young men smiled at each other. The scene froze, then returned to reality. Now an associate professor, [Tang Chuan] stood alone at [Shi Hong]'s doorstep waiting for him to return.
0:18:14|0:18:40|Not long after, [Shi Hong] saw his old friend carrying a single-shoulder bag walking down the stairs. He looked at him in front of the door, paused for a moment, and then led him into the house. [Shi Hong] reached out to turn on the light, which was dim and not very bright. [Tang Chuan] placed the bag in his hand on the table by the door, then turned to look at [Shi Hong] who was sorting books on the sofa, with a big smile on his face.
0:18:40|0:18:52|[Shi Hong] cleaned up the sofa, took off his jacket, and muttered to himself. He opened the refrigerator door covered with notes and found it empty. Then he closed the refrigerator door and said:
0:19:27|0:19:42|[Tang Chuan] raised his glass and clinked it with [Shi Hong], then spoke again. [Tang Chuan] nodded slightly.
0:19:57|0:20:7|The two exchanged a smile, as if they were back to their childhood days. The air seemed much less unfamiliar.
0:20:27|0:20:55|[Tang Chuan] kept staring at [Shi Hong]. [Shi Hong] blinked slightly when their eyes met, looking somewhat puzzled. [Tang Chuan] turned his head and took the briefcase, talking as he pulled out a file folder from it. [Shi Hong] glanced at [Tang Chuan], then at the file folder in his hand, not sure what the other party meant. With soothing music playing, time flowed back to their student days. In an empty classroom, [Tang Chuan] played with a small toy to show [Shi Hong].
0:21:11|0:21:45|[Shi Hong] lowered his head without saying a word, while [Tang Chuan] had a confident look on his face. After hearing, [Shi Hong] looked up at him, put down the pen in his hand, and walked to the platform without saying a word. He picked up a chalk and drew three rows of small dots on the blackboard. While drawing, he said, "[Shi Hong]" After finishing the drawing, he turned around and looked at [Tang Chuan]. [Tang Chuan] smiled confidently, stood up from his desk, quickly walked to the blackboard, and connected the nine dots with four continuous straight lines. Then he looked up at [Shi Hong].
0:21:48|0:22:5|Upon hearing Shi Hong's words, Tang Chuan put away his smile, turned around, and started writing questions on the blackboard. The scene darkened, and time returned to reality. Shi Hong opened a file bag and took out a not-so-thick book from it.
0:22:13|0:22:32|[Tang Chuan] raised an eyebrow as he spoke, while [Shi Hong] seemed to be lost in his book, turning silently to take out a piece of draft paper and a pen to start calculating. [Tang Chuan] watched [Shi Hong] with a slow smile, while on the other side, [Luo Miao] and the young detective arrived at the nightclub.
0:22:51|0:23:6|The landlady cursed [Chen Jing]'s ex-husband while smoking, and told the police everything she knew. Early in the morning, [Tang Chuan] stood by the desk flipping through a notebook filled with formulas, as [Shi Hong] slowly got up from the desk and glanced at him.
0:23:58|0:24:19|[Tang Chuan] did not reply, but instead turned his head to look around. The two of them then left under the bridge and arrived at the entrance of the Xinxin Snack Bar. [Tang Chuan] glanced at the snack bar, then bid farewell and left.
0:24:20|0:24:26|[Shi Hong] watched the other person walk away, then turned and walked into the snack bar, as usual taking money out of his pocket and handing it to the front desk [Chen Jing].
0:24:32|0:24:39|[Shi Hong] left the snack shop with a takeout meal in hand, while not far away [Luo Miao] and a young detective were sitting in a car, jotting down notes in a notebook.
0:25:52|0:26:6|The young detective placed a map and a pen in front of [Chen Jing], waiting for her response. [Luo Miao] and the young detective then arrived at the area marked by [Chen Jing] to begin their investigation.
0:26:6|0:26:14|A young detective walked into a hot dry noodles shop, while [Luo Miao] entered a clothing store. They observed their surroundings while showing their credentials to the waiter.
0:26:20|0:26:27|They each showed a photo of [Chen Jing] to the waiter and received shaking heads as replies. Later, [Luo Miao] found a camera in the clothing store.
0:26:41|0:26:49|[Luo Miao] and the young detective returned to the police station, drawing a timeline while watching the surveillance footage.
0:26:54|0:27:11|The surveillance footage at 9:50 shows that [Chen Jing] was indeed looking at clothes with her daughter in the clothing store. [Luo Miao] frowned and leaned back, then went to the lab to ask for help from [Tang Chuan]. Upon seeing [Luo Miao], [Tang Chuan] gestured for the assistant to leave.
0:27:13|0:27:21|[Luo Miao] walked to the experimental equipment and handed a gun to [Tang Chuan]. [Tang Chuan] took the gun and walked to the recorder to start shooting the experiment.
0:27:24|0:27:29|After the first experiment, Tang Chuan and Luo Miao took off their noise-canceling headphones to change the equipment. While moving things around, Luo Miao turned around and asked,
0:27:38|0:27:45|[Tang Chuan] glanced at [Luo Miao], who stopped what he was doing and walked over to [Tang Chuan], saying,
0:27:51|0:28:4|[Tang Chuan] said nothing, but put on his headphones again to prepare for the second experiment. [Luo Miao] sighed and also put on his headphones. [Luo Miao] took off his headphones to work on the experimental equipment again, while [Tang Chuan] glanced at him sideways.
0:28:10|0:28:33|[Tang Chuan] lowered his head to adjust the instrument while speaking. After finishing, he put on his headphones again and walked to the side of the instrument, preparing for the third experiment. [Luo Miao] glanced at him and also put on headphones. After the experiment, [Tang Chuan] sat at the desk analyzing the results. [Luo Miao] walked over to him and said,
0:28:41|0:28:49|[Tang Chuan] had a serious expression on his face, and after speaking, he lowered his head to continue looking at the materials. [Luo Miao] stood in place, glanced at him, then turned and walked away.
0:28:49|0:28:53|[Tang Chuan] remains in the original position without any change, but his expression seems thoughtful.
0:28:53|0:28:58|The sun was shining outside the house, [Tang Chuan] invited [Shi Hong] to go to the gym to play badminton.
0:29:4|0:29:22|The two of them were engaged in a fierce back-and-forth, with [Tang Chuan] launching strong attacks and [Shi Hong] running around the court to return the ball. Their breathing grew heavier with each exchange, and after several rounds, [Shi Hong] began to retreat step by step, eventually having to smile wryly and shake his head in defeat. After the workout, they both headed to the locker room to quickly tidy up.
0:29:22|0:29:49|[Shi Hong] took off his watch and placed it on the shelf, then stood aside to wash his hands. [Tang Chuan] walked over to the mirror and started fixing his hair. [Shi Hong] watched him with a somewhat envious expression. [Tang Chuan] smiled as he buttoned up his shirt collar and then glanced at the watch on the shelf. Without saying a word, [Shi Hong] turned around to pack his bag.
0:29:51|0:29:57|[Shi Hong] hadn't even had a chance to speak when [Tang Chuan] had already taken the watch, leaving [Shi Hong] standing there in a daze for half a day without reacting.
0:29:57|0:30:4|[Tang Chuan] returned to the laboratory and started conducting experiments with the equipment. A student in a white lab coat walked in.
0:30:12|0:30:30|The student nodded, turned and walked out of the laboratory. [Tang Chuan] turned back to look at the data on the computer again, his expression becoming more and more serious, as if he had something on his mind. After a while, he stood up straight, took out his phone from his pocket, walked to the side and started making a call. The call was answered shortly after it was dialed.
0:30:36|0:30:59|Before long, [Tang Chuan] received the criminal investigation file of the murder and disposal of the body on the riverbank in Jiangbei City Public Security Bureau. Various photos and information covered the table. He looked at them, outlined the key points with a pen, and carefully analyzed the suspect's profile. The report stated that antisocial personality disorder is more accurate than borderline personality disorder, and the two are very similar. It also listed various related behaviors, such as those beyond oneself.
0:30:59|0:31:24|When faced with extreme indifference, he placed the report, physical evidence from the crime scene, and photos of the victim together for examination. Suddenly, the image of [Shi Hong] wielding a hammer and committing murder by the embankment flashed through his mind. [Tang Chuan] leaned back in his chair with relevant documents, closed his eyes with a serious expression, let out a heavy sigh, and threw the documents onto the table. Seeing this, [Luo Miao], who had been waiting in the corner for a while, slowly sat up straight.
0:31:32|0:31:39|[Tang Chuan] remained in the same position as before, his expression very serious. After a long silence, he finally spoke,
0:32:7|0:32:22|[Tang Chuan] stood up from the chair, and [Luo Miao] continued his words.
0:32:59|0:33:6|[Tang Chuan]'s expression became more and more serious. Under the cover of night, the residential buildings were reflected in the roadside puddles, appearing particularly desolate.
0:33:7|0:33:39|At this moment, [Chen Jing] is at home packing clothes. Suddenly, she seems to hear something, then she stops holding the clothes and stands still. After a moment of contemplation, she slowly turns her head to look outside the window. Time quickly goes back to the day when the movie started. A man with medium-length hair, who is [Chen Jing]'s ex-husband [Fu Jian], keeps ringing the doorbell outside. The door of [Chen Jing]'s house is frosted glass, with no peephole to see the outside. After hesitating for a moment, she opens the door, only to find her ex-husband [Fu Jian] outside. Seeing this, [Chen Jing] desperately tries to close the door.
0:33:39|0:33:49|Unable to match the strength of the two, [Fu Jian] exerted force and pushed [Chen Jing] backwards, causing her to fall to the ground at the edge of the table. [Fu Jian] took the opportunity to sneak into the room.
0:34:15|0:34:21|[Chen Jing] is arguing with [Fu Jian], when their daughter [Chen Xiaoxin] suddenly pushes the door open and enters. [Chen Jing] quickly walks over to protect her.
0:34:42|0:34:48|[Fu Jian] pushed [Chen Jing] down and then desperately went to knock on [Chen Xiaoxin]'s door.
0:35:25|0:35:41|[Fu Jian] was unfastening his belt while leaning over [Chen Jing] and kissing her wildly. [Chen Jing] struggled desperately but couldn't break free. [Chen Xiaoxin] couldn't sit still anymore. She looked around, picked up a trophy, and rushed out of the bedroom. She struck [Fu Jian] on the head with the trophy, instantly stunning him.
0:35:42|0:35:52|[Chen Jing] quickly got up and hugged her daughter to comfort her. [Chen Jing] struggled to stand up, but was pushed to the ground by [Chen Jing], who then grabbed [Chen Xiaoxin] by the hair and started beating her up.
0:36:8|0:36:17|[Chen Jing] stood in the middle of the living room in a daze, looking around. Then she yanked the iron wire down and looped it around [Fu Jian]'s neck from behind, pulling it back forcefully.
0:36:17|0:36:30|[Fu Jian] fell backwards without realizing it, his head lying on the coffee table, his neck against the edge of the table, desperately reaching out to grab the power cord, trying to resist, his face showing a very painful and ferocious expression. [Chen Jing] fell too hard on the other side of the coffee table, her hands still...
0:36:30|0:36:41|Tightly holding onto the wire, [Chen Xiaoxin] quickly got up next to stop [Fu Jian] from struggling by biting his hand, [Chen Jing] gritted her teeth and continued to pull the rope with force, while [Fu Jian] kept kicking his legs in a struggle, but the movements were getting smaller and smaller.
0:36:41|0:37:0|During the confrontation, a small clock on the table fell from the coffee table, with its plastic casing landing aside. The hands were still rotating regularly. Every sound in the room was clearly transmitted to the ears of [Shi Hong] next door. He stopped what he was doing and listened carefully to the movements in [Chen Jing]'s house. After a while, [Tang Chuan] stared with wide eyes, mouth slightly open, completely unresponsive.
0:37:0|0:37:7|Chen Xiaoxin, with disheveled hair, knelt to the side panting heavily. As she looked up, she was startled by the appearance of [Fu Jian], taking a step back and collapsing on the ground.
0:37:7|0:37:24|Chen Jing came to her senses, looked down at the already dead Fu Jian, and was so scared that she let go of the wire in her hand. Fu Jian's body slid off the coffee table, Chen Jing's face was full of horror. Chen Xiaoxin knelt and crawled to her mother's side, the mother and daughter hugged tightly, trembling and gasping for breath.
0:37:32|0:37:39|[Chen Jing] and her daughter were startled by the doorbell, and they both turned abruptly to look towards the front door.
0:37:42|0:38:8|Chen Jing immediately pulled her daughter up from the ground and pushed her into the house, then picked up the cloth on the sofa to cover Fu Jian's body. She got up in a panic, breathing heavily, while tidying her hair and clothes. After a moment, she adjusted her emotions, walked to the door and stopped, asking in a steady voice. Chen Jing seemed to breathe a sigh of relief, hesitated for a moment, and then reached out to open the door.
0:38:9|0:38:18|She opened the door a crack, only to see [Shi Hong] standing outside, saying to her,
0:38:26|0:38:35|[Chen Jing] finally breathed a sigh of relief, then lowered her head and slowly spoke.
0:38:37|0:38:58|[Chen Jing] stood in the room, [Shi Hong] stood outside the door, the two of them faced each other in silence. After a moment, [Shi Hong] nodded at [Chen Jing]. She glanced at him, slowly closed the door. As soon as the door closed, [Chen Jing] immediately slumped against it, saying she needed to get her phone. Suddenly, her daughter rushed out to stop her.
0:39:13|0:39:21|The mother and daughter were startled by the doorbell again. [Chen Jing] opened the door slightly, only to see [Shi Hong] standing outside expressionless, and he coldly said,
0:39:43|0:39:58|[Chen Jing] kept her head down without saying a word. [Shi Hong] then walked into the room, turned around and closed the door. He glanced at the position of the body, took out a pair of black gloves from his pocket, put them on, squatted beside the coffee table, and lifted the cloth covering the body.
0:40:31|0:40:40|[Shi Hong] turned to look at the mother and daughter behind him, [Chen Jing] and her daughter's faces were filled with helplessness.
0:41:2|0:41:32|[Shi Hong] stopped his movements, turned his head to look at [Chen Jing]. His expression was indifferent, but his eyes revealed determination. The scene shifted, back to the present. [Chen Jing] stood by the table, lost in thought. She then opened a drawer, placing the neatly folded clothes into the wardrobe one by one. On the other side, [Shi Hong] walked to the public telephone below the residential building, glanced around, and finally made the call.
0:41:32|0:41:40|[Chen Jing] heard the landline ringing at home, she turned around and took a few steps to pick up the phone, it was [Shi Hong] on the other end.
0:42:0|0:42:14|[Shi Hong] paused for a moment, nodded, and there was suddenly silence on the phone, with neither of them speaking. Upstairs, [Chen Jing] was losing control of her emotions, her eyes turning red as she spoke.
0:42:31|0:42:40|[Chen Jing] couldn't help but cry, tears streaming down her face.
0:42:48|0:43:9|She sobbed while wiping her tears, then hung up the phone. [Shi Hong] listened to the crying and the sound of the phone being hung up coming from the receiver, stunned for a moment. He raised his hand to put the receiver back in place, staring blankly at the public phone on the wall, his expression hesitant, as if contemplating something.
0:43:9|0:43:15|He swallowed hard, looked around, then turned and walked off to his right.
0:43:15|0:43:22|The next day, Tang Chuan arrived at the crime scene by the embankment and looked around. Luo Miao walked towards him and started speaking.
0:43:24|0:43:30|He pointed behind him and then pointed in front of him.
0:44:57|0:45:17|After he finished speaking, he continued to walk forward. Behind him, [Luo Miao] and the young detective exchanged a glance and then lifted their legs to catch up with him. Pedestrians were coming and going on the main street in the city center. [Chen Jing] took her daughter [Chen Xiaoxin] to the supermarket to buy groceries. [Chen Jing] pushed the cart, which was already filled with many daily necessities. [Chen Xiaoxin] reached out and grabbed a bottle of sauce to put in the cart. The mother and daughter strolled along as they shopped.
0:45:17|0:45:44|Unexpectedly, [Chen Xiaoxin] suddenly bumped into [Shi Hong] at the corner. [Chen Jing] looked a bit out of control, quickly turned around to comfort her daughter. Seeing this, [Shi Hong] also appeared somewhat unnatural in expression. He turned around, looked at the fruit stall, picked up an orange and smelled it. [Chen Jing] pushed the cart to [Shi Hong]'s side, only to see him putting one orange after another into the bag. [Chen Jing] stared at him for a while, then moved the cart aside and slowly walked up to him.
0:45:44|0:45:52|Gently picking up the orange, [Tang Chuan] lowered his head and said to him,
0:45:55|0:46:26|[Chen Jing] handed the orange in her hand to [Shi Hong]. [Shi Hong] slowly reached out his hand to take the orange from [Chen Jing], hesitated for a moment, then put the orange into the bag. As [Chen Jing] picked oranges and asked a question, [Shi Hong] kept his head down. He remained silent for a while, just about to answer when their conversation was interrupted by a passerby. After the passerby finished shopping, they left. [Chen Jing] and [Shi Hong] stood still. [Chen Jing] looked up at him, then picked up another orange and handed it to him again.
0:46:26|0:46:35|[Shi Hong] still didn't dare to look up, silently took the orange from her, and finally spoke to her,
0:46:40|0:46:47|He said these words, then lowered his eyes, bowed his head, picked up a bag of oranges next to him, and turned to the left to leave.
0:46:47|0:47:13|[Chen Jing] stood there, holding an orange in her hand and slowly turned her head. She watched as [Shi Hong] gradually walked away, as if pondering something. Her face revealed a hint of gratitude and complexity. Another day passed, [Shi Hong] changed into a new jacket and, as usual, carried a single-shoulder bag. He walked alone into the Xinxin Snack Bar. As he approached the counter, he saw [Chen Jing] smiling at him. She spoke as he began to talk.
0:47:14|0:47:26|[Shi Hong] nodded slowly, and [Chen Jing] smiled as she bent down to retrieve a pre-packaged white bag from under the counter and handed it to him. He looked up at [Chen Jing] somewhat dazed, quickly lowered his head to accept the bag and thanked her.
0:47:27|0:47:32|[Shi Hong] took the bag and turned to leave, while [Chen Jing] gazed at his back for a long time without coming back to her senses.
0:47:32|0:47:51|During lunchtime, all the teachers went out to eat, leaving [Shi Hong] alone in the office. Sitting in front of the computer, [Shi Hong] picked up a white takeout bag from the side, took out the meal and placed it on the desk. As he was about to put the bag down, he found a note inside that read: "Remember to eat on time, take care of yourself. Thank you for everything you've done for us."
0:47:51|0:48:12|[Shi Hong] looked at the note in his hand, a smile appearing on his face. As night fell, [Shi Hong] carried a box of garbage outside. Carefully supporting the box, he slowly walked to the garbage station. A nearby resident had just finished throwing away trash and was walking out. [Shi Hong] carefully avoided him, walked to the trash can, lifted the lid, and threw the box in.
0:48:12|0:48:22|Coincidentally, [Chen Xiaoxin] also came to dump the garbage at this time. When she saw [Shi Hong], she wanted to hide, but still walked up to him and called out to him.
0:48:23|0:48:30|[Shi Hong] glanced at her and quickly looked away. [Chen Xiaoxin] walked up to him, throwing away trash as she spoke.
0:48:49|0:49:25|[Shi Hong] looked up at her, with a comforting look in his eyes. [Chen Xiaoxin] turned around to go home, then quickly turned back and said something. [Shi Hong] looked at [Chen Xiaoxin] with surprise, nodded at her, and the two stood side by side next to the trash can, looking at each other and smiling. Afterwards, [Chen Xiaoxin] turned around and went home, while [Shi Hong] watched her leave and then lowered his head again.
0:49:26|0:49:49|[Chen Xiaoxin] returned home and stayed alone in her bedroom practicing the clarinet. [Shi Hong] sat at the desk, grading papers, while enjoying the music coming from next door, with a look of pure enjoyment on his face.
0:49:57|0:50:13|In the laboratory, [Tang Chuan] picked up [Shi Hong]'s watch thoughtfully. Outside, [Luo Miao] and the young detective sat in the car keeping watch. In the Xinxin Snack Bar, [Chen Jing] was cleaning. A man in a suit walked in carrying a briefcase, and [Chen Jing] looked surprised when she saw him.
0:50:15|0:50:30|Kun Ge walked towards [Chen Jing] with a smile on his face, stood in front of her without saying a word for a long time, then the scene switched back to inside the residential building. [Chen Xiaoxin] was still practicing the double reed diligently, [Shi Hong] got up from the desk and walked to the wall, gently tapping it a few times.
0:50:32|0:50:47|[Chen Xiaoxin] listened to the tapping sound while searching Morse code online. After translating it, all the tapping sounds formed a word, "beautiful." It turned out that [Shi Hong] was praising her for playing the flute so well. A happy smile appeared on [Chen Xiaoxin]'s face. Then the scene shifted to the restaurant.
0:52:2|0:52:12|Kun ge picked up a shrimp with chopsticks and handed it to [Chen Jing]. [Chen Jing] smiled and was about to eat it when suddenly it started pouring rain outside. [Chen Jing] turned her head to look out the window, appearing somewhat worried.
0:52:15|0:52:39|The rain was getting heavier, [Chen Jing] sat in Kun Ge's car and spoke to him. [Chen Jing] glanced at Kun Ge, then turned her head away. The two remained silent, the sound of thunder rang out. [Chen Jing] secretly hung up the phone. Downstairs in the residential building, [Shi Hong] stood in front of the public telephone, staring blankly as he put down the receiver.
0:52:42|0:52:56|The rain was getting heavier. Without reaching anyone on the phone, [Shi Hong] glanced back and quietly opened his umbrella, ready to go home. There were only a few pedestrians occasionally passing by on the rain-soaked street. [Shi Hong] had just entered the entrance of the building, folding up his umbrella and preparing to go upstairs.
0:52:56|0:53:28|Not far away, a car drove over. Kun Ge parked the car in front of the residential building, opened the umbrella to help [Chen Jing] get out of the car. [Chen Jing] got down from the passenger seat with one hand holding the bag on her shoulder. Kun Ge handed the umbrella to [Chen Jing] while talking, then quickly ran to the driver's seat and drove away in the blink of an eye. [Chen Jing] stood in place watching him leave, then looked up to see [Shi Hong] watching her from upstairs.
0:53:28|0:53:35|She suddenly stood there in a daze, unsure of how to react. [Shi Hong] glanced at her for a moment, then left the railing and headed back home.
0:53:35|0:54:15|[Chen Jing] looked at the back of [Shi Hong] in a daze. Not far away, [Luo Miao] and the young detective were sitting in the car watching everything that was happening at the moment. [Chen Jing] stood in the rain holding an umbrella, motionless for a long time. [Shi Hong] quickly walked into the house and closed the door. He bent over in front of the door, panting heavily. Suddenly, his body went limp and he collapsed against the wall as if he had been shocked by something. The umbrella was leaning to the side next to him, and raindrops kept dripping on the ground.
0:54:15|0:54:22|He slowly got up and walked to the desk by the window, sat down on the chair weakly, looking completely dispirited.
0:54:22|0:54:28|He lowered his head as if pondering, or perhaps writing something, while the pouring rain continued.
0:54:28|0:54:44|Next door, [Chen Jing] returned home to change out of her rain-soaked clothes. She tied up her hair and put on some home clothes. The living room was dimly lit, with only a floor lamp emitting a dim yellow light. She sat at the dining table, cutting fruits while watching TV, her expression revealing a sense of distraction.
0:54:44|0:54:50|Daughter [Chen Xiaoxin] was sitting on the sofa hugging a pillow, completely unaware of her mother's unusual behavior while watching TV dramas.
0:54:50|0:55:2|As the night quietly passed, the next day at dawn, [Chen Jing] arrived alone at the men's clothing store. She picked out a jacket, and as the salesperson folded the clothes, they chatted with her.
0:55:7|0:55:20|The salesperson placed the neatly folded coat on the counter, bent down to grab a shopping bag. [Chen Jing] caressed the coat in front of her, a smile gradually appearing on her face. The scene darkened, [Tang Chuan] stood outside the gate of Jiangbei Yucai Elementary School, waiting for [Shi Hong] to finish class.
0:55:24|0:55:39|The bell rang, and [Shi Hong] walked out with the crowd. As he reached the school gate, he saw [Tang Chuan] leaning against the wall, who turned his head and said,
0:55:42|0:55:46|[Shi Hong] shook his head, then raised his chin and pointed forward, indicating him to follow.
0:55:46|0:56:12|Chen Jing and Shi Hong walked into the Xinxin Snack Bar, with Chen Jing bending down to pick up a clothing bag under the counter when she saw Shi Hong. Shi Hong quickly spoke up to stop her, causing Chen Jing to pause before putting the bag back in place. She glanced at Shi Hong, then at Tang Chuan, creating a slightly awkward atmosphere. Shi Hong turned to look at Tang Chuan, who smiled and said something. Chen Jing forced a smile in response.
0:56:25|0:56:33|[Tang Chuan] picked up his phone and glanced at it before stepping aside to answer the call.
0:56:47|0:56:56|[Chen Jing] refused Kun Ge verbally, while handing the ticket to [Shi Hong]. Meanwhile, [Tang Chuan] answered the phone and observed [Shi Hong]'s reaction in the mirror on the wall.
0:56:58|0:57:16|[Chen Jing] turned around and handed the packed bag to [Shi Hong]. Kun ge continued to smile and chat with [Chen Jing]. [Shi Hong] took the bag and turned to leave. [Tang Chuan] glanced at [Chen Jing] and followed her out. After walking out of the snack shop, he said to [Shi Hong],
0:57:32|0:57:56|After exchanging a few seconds of eye contact with Tang Chuan and Shi Hong, Shi Hong hesitated for a moment before following Tang Chuan as they walked forward. They arrived at the office, where Tang Chuan stood by the sink, lowering his head to make coffee. Occasionally, he glanced up at Shi Hong, who was busy cleaning up the leftover trash from their meal. As Shi Hong cleaned, he looked up at a mechanical diagram drawn on the blackboard next to him.
0:57:56|0:58:0|Then [Tang Chuan] walked towards the trash can with the garbage in hand and threw the takeout box into it.
0:58:17|0:58:31|[Shi Hong] refused the coffee offered by [Tang Chuan], took out a tissue and started wiping the table. As he wiped, he asked a question. [Tang Chuan] glanced at him after hearing the question.
0:58:47|0:58:58|[Shi Hong] came to the rack to observe the instruments on top. [Tang Chuan] walked up behind him and asked. [Shi Hong] glanced at him and calmly replied.
0:59:51|1:0:5|[Shi Hong] nodded to [Tang Chuan], then prepared to leave. [Tang Chuan] put his hands in his pockets and walked out to see [Shi Hong] off. The two walked through the long corridor, one in front and one behind, in silence. When they reached the corner of the stairs, [Tang Chuan] suddenly spoke,
1:0:28|1:0:52|After Shi Hong finished speaking, he turned and left alone. Tang Chuan stood on the steps, watching Shi Hong's back with a serious expression. In the classroom, a student intentionally threw a large paper ball at Shi Hong's back. Shi Hong put down the chalk and slowly turned around.
1:0:55|1:1:2|Shi Hong's voice was very stern. Outside the classroom, Luo Miao and the young detective happened to pass by. They saw Shi Hong shouting loudly at a student.
1:1:12|1:1:18|After class, [Luo Miao] came to the office and placed an attendance book in front of [Shi Hong], asking,
1:1:43|1:1:50|[Luo Miao] put away the attendance book, and a detective pushed a notebook and a pen in front of [Shi Hong]. [Shi Hong] looked up at the two of them.
1:2:38|1:2:58|After finishing speaking, [Luo Miao] opened the door and sat in the driver's seat, while the young detective opened the door and sat in the passenger seat. They drove away together. As the sky darkened, [Shi Hong] parked a black car by the roadside. His eyes kept scanning outside, as if observing something or waiting for someone to appear. Suddenly, [Shi Hong] raised his heavy camera and started taking pictures outside.
1:2:58|1:3:18|Following the direction of the camera, we see Kun Ge walking out of a building. He is dressed in a shirt and suit as usual, carrying a briefcase in his right hand. He walks towards the outside, raising his left hand with a watch on to check the time. Completely unaware that someone is secretly filming him, he walks from the street into an indoor parking lot, then drives off towards his destination.
1:3:18|1:3:41|[Shi Hong] stepped on the gas and turned the steering wheel. Following closely behind, through the rearview mirror in front of the car, [Shi Hong]'s emotionless eyes could be seen. He drove along with Kun Ge through several streets. Kun Ge made a right turn and parked the car in a parking space by the roadside. Seeing this, [Shi Hong] immediately parked his car in an empty space not far away. He watched Kun Ge get out of the car, raised his hand to lock the car door with the key.
1:3:41|1:4:6|Then he walked into the nearby restaurant, [Shi Hong] sat in the car and took out his camera again to secretly take photos. From the lens, we can see [Chen Jing] suddenly appearing behind Kun Ge. [Shi Hong]'s hand hesitated for a moment, he put down the camera and looked at the restaurant for a while, then raised the camera again. With the guidance of the restaurant waiter, [Chen Jing] followed Kun Ge and sat in the empty seat next to the floor-to-ceiling glass. Through the glass window, [Shi Hong] could clearly see their every move.
1:4:6|1:4:15|He saw [Chen Jing] placing her bag on the right side, while Kun Ge across the table was flipping through the menu and talking to [Chen Jing] with great enthusiasm.
1:4:30|1:4:38|[Chen Jing] smiled slightly, without giving a reply to Kun Ge. [Shi Hong], who was squatting outside the restaurant, then returned home alone. He looked through photos while writing something.
1:4:55|1:5:6|[Shi Hong] puts the printed photos and letter into [Chen Jing]'s mailbox. When [Chen Jing] sees it, she explodes in anger, pounding the wall in the living room and then throwing the clothes she bought for [Shi Hong] into the trash can.
1:5:9|1:5:17|The next day, [Shi Hong] followed Kun Ge to the place where they discussed business. He glanced at Kun Ge, then ducked into a phone booth to make a call.
1:5:27|1:5:48|[Shi Hong] hung up the phone directly. Ambulances and police cars were dispatched at the same time, heading towards the location mentioned by [Shi Hong]. On the other side, Kun Ge, who had just finished his business, walked into the parking lot. He was about to get into his car when he was attacked by a man with a stick. He quickly dodged, and shortly after, the police car arrived. The man was taken back to the police station by the police.
1:6:14|1:6:26|[Luo Miao] placed several photos in front of [Chen Jing], which were the ones secretly taken by [Shi Hong]. [Chen Jing] hesitated for a moment before speaking. Upon hearing her words, [Luo Miao] looked up and shook her head towards [Tang Chuan] not far away. A look of helplessness appeared on [Tang Chuan]'s face as well.
1:6:43|1:6:58|[Luo Miao] angrily pounded the table, while a room full of police officers sat in the office unsure of what to do. Just then, [Tang Chuan]'s phone rang with a notification sound. He took out his phone and saw that it was a message from [Shi Hong], asking if he wanted to go mountain climbing together tomorrow.
1:6:58|1:7:19|The next morning, a bus drove along a forest road and stopped next to a sign. [Tang Chuan] got off the bus with a backpack and saw [Shi Hong] in mountaineering gear standing with hands in pockets by the roadside, next to a large mountaineering bag. Clearly, [Shi Hong] had been waiting for a while. When [Tang Chuan] walked up to him, [Shi Hong] took his hands out of his pockets.
1:7:19|1:7:28|Bending down to pick up the backpack next to him and putting it on his back, [Tang Chuan] glanced at him and said,
1:7:31|1:7:40|[Shi Hong] replied while packing his bag, fastening the bag to his chest and then turned to walk up the mountain. [Tang Chuan] stood still for a few seconds before following.
1:7:40|1:7:51|Two people walked in the woods, one in front and one behind. The woods were filled with fog, no sun, the ground was damp, covered with dry branches, rotten leaves, and weeds. [Shi Hong] walked in the front, not looking back, and said,
1:7:59|1:8:10|[Tang Chuan] did not respond to his words, but followed his footsteps into the depths of the forest. The path became increasingly difficult, with tree branches extending everywhere, posing a risk of getting scratched if one wasn't careful.
1:8:10|1:8:29|[Tang Chuan] took each step very carefully and difficultly, while [Shi Hong] seemed to be back in his comfort zone. He easily jumped on the almost flat slope and walked on the stones in the middle of the stream as if walking on flat ground, effortlessly reaching the other side. Meanwhile, [Tang Chuan] almost stumbled downhill, stepping into the water with every two steps, struggling to even stand steadily.
1:8:29|1:8:35|[Shi Hong] climbed over a steep slope, glanced back at the disheveled [Tang Chuan], then turned back and continued walking forward.
1:8:35|1:9:5|[Tang Chuan] carefully steadied his steps, wading through the water to the other side and continued to follow. After walking for a long time, they stopped next to a huge fallen tree. [Shi Hong] placed his backpack to the side and then gestured for [Tang Chuan] to wait here. [Tang Chuan] lifted his leg over the fallen tree, adjusted his clothes, and sat down. He glanced at the bag left by [Shi Hong] and saw a bundle of thick rope sticking out from the side. It seemed like he realized something. Meanwhile, not far away, [Shi Hong] walked uphill and entered a small wooden house.
1:9:5|1:9:9|Open the door, take out an axe from the table at the door, and walk towards [Tang Chuan].
1:9:9|1:9:18|[Tang Chuan] saw [Shi Hong] approaching him with an axe, and he was so scared that he stood up directly from the dead wood. He nervously watched [Shi Hong] getting closer and closer, unsure of how to react.
1:9:18|1:9:51|Shi Hong's face still showed no expression as he calmly walked up to Tang Chuan and said, "Shi Hong took a small step forward, tossed the axe up, and handed it to Tang Chuan. Tang Chuan glanced at a stack of firewood next to the small cabin, then breathed a sigh of relief as he took the axe from Shi Hong. Shi Hong then started a fire by the stream, while Tang Chuan sat down and spoke:
1:9:58|1:10:7|[Shi Hong] finished speaking and then turned his body in another direction. Beside him, [Tang Chuan] turned his head to look at him.
1:10:59|1:11:7|[Shi Hong] recalled the past while sitting alone at home, with the blackboard covered in formulas.
1:11:16|1:11:33|He wrote and erased on the blackboard repeatedly, sitting at the desk calculating desperately. He spread out sheets of parchment, filled them with writing, then crumpled them up and threw them into the wastebasket on the floor. He repeated this action over and over again.
1:11:33|1:11:42|Next to the trash can was already filled with draft paper, he was despairingly lying on the table gasping for breath, as if the whole person had already sunk into a state of collapse.
1:11:42|1:11:47|He brought a chair over and slowly stepped on it, pulling down the rope hanging from the beam, preparing to hang himself.
1:11:47|1:12:7|However, as he hesitated when he put his neck into the rope, [Shi Hong] seemed to fall back into the despair he had experienced before, unable to extricate himself for a long time. He stared blankly at the stream in front of him, where a whole dried leaf floated on the water, accompanying the flow of the stream, then hitting a nearby rock and spinning in circles incessantly.
1:12:15|1:12:25|[Shi Hong] let out a soft sigh, then smiled bitterly and said:
1:12:30|1:12:57|[Shi Hong] stared into [Tang Chuan]'s eyes as if making a decision. After a moment, [Shi Hong] suddenly looked away, glanced at the fire beside him, then turned and bent down to pick up a container for the soup. [Tang Chuan] watched his movements, then looked around with a sigh before speaking,
1:13:3|1:13:10|[Shi Hong] handed the container of hot soup to [Tang Chuan]. [Tang Chuan] took the soup, blew on it gently, and then took a sip.
1:13:42|1:13:58|[Tang Chuan] stared at [Shi Hong]'s eyes while speaking, but [Shi Hong] did not look away. They locked eyes with each other. After a couple of dried leaves spun in the stream and drifted away, [Shi Hong] spoke up:
1:14:10|1:14:32|Shi Hong fell silent after speaking, and Tang Chuan didn't say anything either. The two of them quietly looked at the scenery in front of them without speaking. Meanwhile, Chen Jing was in the living room tidying up the dining table, and Chen Xiaoxin was getting ready to leave with a backpack on her back. The band was going to participate in a competition today. Chen Jing didn't respond, she picked up the plates to wash them. Just as she reached the window, she was startled by a figure outside.
1:14:33|1:14:47|[Chen Jing] suddenly walked to her daughter and reminded her: [Chen Jing] touched her daughter's hair, opened the door to see her off, and then went to Xin Xin Snack Bar after making sure everything was in order.
1:14:49|1:14:55|Chen Jing stood behind the counter, staring blankly at a mother and daughter eating in the shop.
1:14:58|1:15:24|[Chen Jing] was startled by the voice of [Shi Hong] as soon as she answered the phone. Sitting in the driver's seat of the car, [Shi Hong] slowly took the phone from beside his ear with a cold and indifferent expression. After hanging up the phone, [Chen Jing] ran back home, sprinting to the mailbox to retrieve a letter. Inside was a white paper with the words: "You ruined everything for me, now I will take everything from you." Under the white paper were several photos of [Chen Xiaoxin] taken secretly.
1:15:24|1:15:33|[Chen Jing] instantly broke down emotionally, trembling as she took out her phone from her bag. She cried while dialing a number.
1:15:42|1:15:48|She leaned weakly against the railing with one hand, squatting on the ground for help. [Luo Miao] received a call and then ran outside with the young detective.
1:15:53|1:16:19|Two people quickly got into the car and drove towards their destination. On the other side, [Tang Chuan] walked into the laboratory as usual, carrying his briefcase. He reached the door, took out his keys to open it, only to find it already unlocked. [Tang Chuan] briskly entered the laboratory, but found it empty. As he walked to the table and just set down his bag and keys, he sensed something was wrong. The directional sound wave generator in the lab was missing, while at that moment in the car, [Shi Hong] sat next to the driver's seat with the lost device.
1:16:19|1:16:28|[Shi Hong] started the car and drove off, pressing down on the gas pedal and turning the steering wheel to move forward. His expressionless face remained the same, yet there seemed to be a hint of madness in his eyes.
1:16:28|1:16:35|In the laboratory, [Tang Chuan] is running out while talking on the phone to [Luo Miao].
1:16:55|1:17:4|[Tang Chuan] was on the phone with [Luo Miao] while running towards the office building. He quickly got into the car, stepped on the gas pedal, and started speeding down the narrow road, completely ignoring the issue of overspeeding.
1:17:4|1:17:15|He took a shortcut by driving against the traffic on a one-way street, narrowly avoiding a collision with another car. The scene then shifts to the main road, where the school bus of Jiangbei Experimental First Middle School is moving forward on the street.
1:17:18|1:17:35|Students were singing under the guidance of the teacher, but [Chen Xiaoxin] in the back row by the window was looking outside without saying a word. Meanwhile, [Luo Miao] who was running wildly and the young detective were blocked at the intersection.
1:17:44|1:18:3|The teacher stood in the middle of the car, but his phone was placed in the clothes on the seat, so he naturally couldn't hear the phone vibrating. [Luo Miao] was a bit anxious and turned to drive towards the side road. [Tang Chuan] was also desperately accelerating to catch up. However, [Shi Hong], who caused all this panic, was driving calmly without any hurry.
1:18:3|1:18:29|After a long chase, the young detective finally spotted the school bus of Jiangbei Experimental First Middle School at a bend. He quickly pointed it out to [Luo Miao], who saw the bus and immediately sounded the siren, speeding up towards the bus. By this time, the bus had already entered the elevated bridge. [Luo Miao] drove closely behind, about to catch up.
1:18:33|1:18:54|Luo Miao chased after the car while honking the horn to signal the driver to stop. Inside the car, the students also heard the commotion outside and looked out simultaneously. The driver glanced down as Luo Miao and the young detective pointed ahead to signal him to stop. Several other police cars caught up and surrounded the bus. The young detective handed the phone to Chen Xiaoxin and asked her to.
1:18:54|1:19:1|She reported her safety to [Chen Jing], and [Chen Xiaoxin] returned the phone to the young detective.
1:19:32|1:19:54|[Luo Miao] finished speaking and ran off, with the young detective following him towards the car. Meanwhile, [Tang Chuan] continued driving frantically, passing the section of road where the bus had previously traveled. [Shi Hong], who had been waiting on the side, also followed suit. [Luo Miao] returned to the car and drove in the direction from which he had just come. He steered with his left hand, picked up his phone with his right hand, paying attention to traffic while calling [Tang Chuan].
1:19:54|1:20:2|However, despite dialing multiple times, nobody answered. [Luo Miao] was getting anxious, but [Tang Chuan] was solely focused on driving and completely oblivious to the vibrating phone.
1:20:8|1:20:24|[Luo Miao] could only sit in the car anxiously, speeding towards [Tang Chuan]. However, [Tang Chuan] himself was completely unaware of the impending danger, as [Shi Hong] behind him slowly began to accelerate to overtake, gradually reaching a parallel driving state with [Tang Chuan].
1:20:24|1:20:45|At the critical moment, while rushing to the destination, [Tang Chuan] finally answered the phone call from [Luo Miao]. As he turned his head, he saw the directional sound wave generator charging towards him, activated by [Shi Hong]. A faint headache started to bother [Tang Chuan], making it impossible for him to control the steering wheel.
1:21:6|1:21:35|He parked the car on the side and ran towards [Tang Chuan]. The scene gradually darkened, and a few days later, [Tang Chuan] sat alone on a bench outside the hospital ward, staring straight ahead with a neck brace on and his right hand resting on the backrest. It was unclear what he was thinking. Soon after, [Luo Miao] walked over and sat next to [Tang Chuan], looking at the hospital scenery while speaking to him.
1:21:46|1:21:53|[Tang Chuan] stood up straight after hearing it, glanced sideways at [Luo Miao], rolled his eyes at him, and then asked:
1:23:7|1:23:12|[Tang Chuan] said nothing, as if lost in thought.
1:23:19|1:23:46|[Chen Jing]'s family's TV was showing the scene of [Shi Hong] being arrested. [Chen Xiaoxin] raised the remote control to turn off the TV and asked, [Chen Xiaoxin] walked behind her mother, with a serious expression on her young face.
1:23:46|1:23:57|[Chen Jing] did not speak after hearing her daughter's words. Instead, she slowly turned around to look at her daughter, then embraced her tightly, tears in her eyes, without saying a word.
1:23:57|1:24:10|The next day, [Tang Chuan] was alone in the laboratory, organizing documents at his desk. Suddenly, [Luo Miao] walked in, with his hands in his pockets, silently watching the busy [Tang Chuan], seeming a bit gloomy.
1:24:10|1:24:16|[Tang Chuan] looked up at him, tidying up while asking,
1:24:31|1:24:39|[Luo Miao] handed a stack of documents to [Tang Chuan], who set them aside.
1:24:49|1:25:9|[Tang Chuan] pondered for a moment, nodded, and then turned to draw nine dots in a 3x3 grid on the blackboard. [Luo Miao] looked at the nine dots, crossed his hands, seemingly puzzled.
1:25:30|1:25:36|[Tang Chuan] recalled what [Shi Hong] had said, and a series of case files he had seen flashed through his mind.
1:26:10|1:26:26|[Tang Chuan] leaned forward, hands on the desk, eyes reddened and teary, as if struck by something. It seemed like he suddenly remembered something, then turned and ran out. Behind him, [Luo Miao] looked confused, standing still, watching him run out of the laboratory door.
1:26:26|1:26:44|The next morning, [Tang Chuan] changed into a new outfit and ran desperately under the bridge where [Shi Hong] passed by every day. Sweat soaked his clothes as he gasped for breath and sprinted. Pedestrians passed by constantly, including young men in suits carrying briefcases and female white-collar workers in formal attire and high heels.
1:26:44|1:26:55|There are students in school uniforms carrying backpacks, elderly couples taking a stroll, and young lovers sitting by the roadside cuddling together. They are intimately chatting and laughing, with sweet smiles on their faces.
1:26:55|1:27:8|[Tang Chuan] sprinted through the crowd, but as he ran, it seemed like he was running out of energy. He slowed down, gradually came to a stop, bent his legs, placed his hands on his knees, bent over to catch his breath, and then continued running forward.
1:27:8|1:27:30|He ran while looking at the crowds coming and going on the roadside, the small stalls selling grilled cold noodles and fried skewers, the middle-aged man buying snacks for children, the smiling aunties dancing in the square, the grandpas playing chess together, the old grandpa sitting in the corner boiling water, and the homeless man collecting scrap. He suddenly stopped in his tracks, staring blankly at these people, standing still and lost in thought, tears seemingly welling up in his eyes but not falling.
1:27:30|1:27:35|After a moment, [Tang Chuan] turned around again and ran along the road under the bridge.
1:27:35|1:27:59|After exercising, [Tang Chuan] changed into a suit and walked into the Xinxin Snack Bar with a briefcase. [Chen Jing] was busy serving dishes behind the counter. When she turned around, she saw [Tang Chuan]. He walked a few steps forward and said to her, "[Chen Jing]," nodded at him. Then the two of them walked outside and sat on a bench by the road, chatting.
1:28:42|1:28:51|[Tang Chuan] watched as [Chen Jing] revealed her deduction to her. There was a hint of uncertainty in [Chen Jing]'s eyes, she neither moved nor spoke.
1:29:7|1:29:33|[Tang Chuan] stopped halfway through his words, just staring straight ahead without moving, sitting in a chair. Beside him, [Chen Jing] suddenly turned her head to look at him, her eyes filled with confusion. [Tang Chuan] didn't continue speaking, instead turning his head to the side. After a moment, the scene suddenly shifted to a prison cell, where [Shi Hong] lay on the bunk in a Jiangkan 319 prison uniform, staring blankly at the ceiling.
1:29:33|1:29:51|He suddenly saw many geometric shapes in front of his eyes, with a slight smile on his lips, seeming somewhat happy. Hearing someone calling his name, [Shi Hong] slowly came back to his senses, glanced in the direction of the door, then calmly sat up on the edge of the bed, lost in thought.
1:29:51|1:30:3|After a while, the prison guard handcuffed him and took him to the interrogation room. [Tang Chuan] had been waiting inside for a long time. The guard opened the door, watched [Shi Hong] walk in, and then closed the door.
1:30:3|1:30:33|[Tang Chuan] glanced at [Shi Hong] with his head tilted, then looked up at the monitor and said, "[Shi Hong], sit up straight." [Shi Hong] bent over in his chair and looked up at [Tang Chuan], who then said, "[Shi Hong], you're smiling."
1:34:16|1:34:23|[Shi Hong] suddenly flashed back to the scene of himself standing on a bridge one night, throwing something into the water. After a moment of silence, he spoke:
1:34:48|1:35:17|[Shi Hong] clenched his fists on the table, bent down to lock eyes with [Tang Chuan] for a few seconds, then walked towards the door. [Tang Chuan] watched him and suddenly spoke: "Stop, [Shi Hong]." [Shi Hong] didn't reply, but instead slowly walked to the door and knocked.
1:35:24|1:35:49|The scene suddenly cuts back to the day when [Shi Hong] was emotionally breaking down, with formulas repeatedly erased and rewritten on the blackboard, crumpled draft papers in the wastebasket. He was engulfed in despair, preparing to end his life by hanging. Just as he was about to let go, the doorbell interrupted him. [Shi Hong] opened the door, the glaring sunlight making it hard for him to keep his eyes open.
1:36:7|1:36:16|[Shi Hong] nodded at them for a moment, then gently closed the door and went back into the room to get a book. The mother and daughter smiled at each other and waited outside the door.
1:36:37|1:36:42|The mother and daughter bid farewell and left, [Shi Hong] closed the door and walked into the house.
1:36:44|1:37:7|He stood in front of the door, looking down at the small gift in his hand. It was a greeting card with a butterfly bow tied at the top. The upper part of the card had a cute smiley face drawn on it, with "Thank you for your kindness" written in the middle. At the bottom, a line of small words read: Jiangbei City First Experimental Middle School. He stared at the card for a while, then looked up at the rope on the roof, as if he had figured something out.
1:38:42|1:39:5|[Shi Hong] flashed through many scenes in his mind, including the scenes of [Chen Jing] and [Chen Xiaoxin] moving in and tidying up the house, the scene of [Chen Jing] receiving a threatening letter, and the scene of him with Kun Ge. With a relieved expression, he walked towards the prison cell, only to unexpectedly see [Chen Jing] on the way. A female police officer stood on her right, pulling her arm, while [Luo Miao] stood on her left. Upon seeing [Shi Hong], [Chen Jing] immediately knelt down.
1:40:8|1:40:21|[Chen Jing] knelt on the ground, apologizing and crying, while [Shi Hong] stood behind her with a heavy heart, shedding tears. [Luo Miao] stood quietly behind them, watching everything in front of her. Not far away, [Tang Chuan] had his back turned to them, unable to bear watching.
1:40:39|1:40:57|Chen Jing and Shi Hong were taken away by the police, their cries echoing in the prison, lingering for a long time. Tang Chuan did not look back at the sound behind him, and walked out alone.
1:40:57|1:41:8|Three months later, above the sparkling sea, a few seagulls were flying low in the sky. A gentle breeze brushed by, and the dim yellow sunlight shone in the middle of the water, appearing somewhat dazzling.
1:41:8|1:41:20|In the laboratory, [Tang Chuan] sat alone at the desk, with only a desk lamp lit in the spacious and tidy room. He flipped through the experiment report in front of him, then suddenly got up and walked towards the bookshelf at the side.
1:41:20|1:41:44|[Tang Chuan] walked up to the densely packed bookshelf filled with professional books, quickly found the information he wanted to read, just as he pulled out half of it, he suddenly stopped his hand movement, and casually pulled out another piece of information not far away. The cover of the parchment paper read: Proof of the Riemann Hypothesis. He opened the information, inside was a notebook sandwiched in between, the originally semi-transparent draft paper was filled with dense formulas. [Tang Chuan] flipped through two pages, then closed the information and put it back on the bookshelf.
1:41:44|1:41:52|The next day, [Tang Chuan] came to the court alone, sat on a bench, and flipped through a book.
1:41:58|1:42:5|[Luo Miao] walked out of the room while talking on the phone. As soon as he looked up, he saw [Tang Chuan]. He hung up the phone, walked over to [Tang Chuan], sat down next to him, and said:
