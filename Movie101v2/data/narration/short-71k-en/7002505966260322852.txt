0:3:10|0:3:20|[Zhang Zaishan] nodded and closed the trunk. Instead of getting into the car immediately, he peeked through the rear window and saw [Hong Jibiao] attaching a small timed bomb underneath the taxi.
0:3:20|0:3:23|Then he closed the trunk and drove away.
0:3:23|0:3:34|Three taxis drove out of the abandoned car park one after another. They seemed ordinary, but now they were all mobile bombs. Only [Zhang Zaishan] returned to the Honda car. At this moment, the police headquarters received a phone call.
0:3:48|0:3:53|Three cars turned into the alley and started changing their license plates.
0:4:10|0:4:18|Officer Yin Xiaofeng hands the note to Governor Jiang. Meanwhile, Zhang Zaishan is putting the bomb-making tools one by one into the car. After closing the car door, he drives to meet the boss.
0:4:18|0:4:28|Before long, the car stopped in the wilderness. Inside the car, [Zhang Zaishan] was bored playing a mobile game. The phone contained a police tracking chip used to track and protect the undercover [Zhang Zaishan].
0:4:28|0:4:37|At this moment, an off-road vehicle arrived, and the person getting off the car was none other than the boss [Hong Jipeng], with his medium-length curly hair, round face, and prominent jawline.
0:4:37|0:4:42|After getting off the car, he picked up a bottle of wine and drank it, then saw [Zhang Zaishan], handed over the wine pot casually, and [Zhang Zaishan] took it and drank it.
0:4:44|0:4:50|Another henchman poured gasoline on the Honda car, causing an explosion that destroyed all the production evidence.
0:4:50|0:4:56|The car raced forward, with the driver's henchman dismantling a cellphone into parts with one hand, and [Zhang Zaishan] followed suit.
0:4:56|0:5:2|All the cellphones were stuffed into the drawer, while on the police side.
0:5:5|0:5:14|Governor Jiang is extremely anxious. At night, a SUV stops by the roadside, with henchmen, Zhang Zaishan, and Hong Jipeng putting on clown masks, then stepping on the gas pedal.
0:5:15|0:5:31|In the security room's surveillance footage, an off-road vehicle crashed through the iron gate, and the security guard who ran out was shot at by another off-road vehicle from behind. In this violent manner, the two cars forcefully broke into the underground parking garage of the bank. After a brief stop, another accomplice jumped out and caused chaos in the parking lot.
0:5:33|0:5:37|On the other side, the off-road vehicle crashed into the rolling shutter gate, and the security guard who didn't have time to react was swept by the submachine gun fire.
0:5:41|0:5:47|Gunfire erupted from the car window, the security guard was powerless to defend himself, and the group quickly stormed up to the second floor.
0:5:48|0:5:57|The security guard who blocked the stairs didn't have time to react and died on the spot. The robbers on the first floor expressed their arrogance with guns, and the defenseless security guard died on the spot.
0:5:57|0:6:4|His single-shot shotgun was completely suppressed. In the corridor, with just a quick reload, the robber could stick out and wildly spray bullets.
0:6:4|0:6:8|The fallen security guard shattered the glass. And at this moment, the police station responded immediately.
0:6:21|0:6:25|At the entrance of the bank vault, the robbers are covering their leader.
0:6:25|0:6:34|[Hong Jipeng] attached two bombs to the locks, several people quickly stood aside, their bodies pressed against the wall, then [Hong Jipeng] pressed the remote control.
0:6:34|0:6:44|The lock was blown away, [Hong Jipeng] struggled to open the gate, while his men were pulling a cart ready to transport the cash.
0:6:46|0:6:50|Saying that, he quickly pulled open the henchman who was preparing to load the money, and soon, the two of them threw the packaged cash into the car.
0:6:50|0:6:56|In the parking lot, the accomplices calculated the time. At this moment, in the bank vault, cars were being pushed out carrying cash.
0:6:56|0:7:2|The car stopped in front of the emergency slide, and the robbers quickly threw the bundled cash down the slide.
0:7:2|0:7:7|At the other end of the slide, the accomplice holding a travel bag for support was already in position.
0:7:8|0:7:18|[Hong Jipeng] sniffed the cash fiercely, then threw it out forcefully. The robbers who had finished unloading the cash jumped onto the slide and slid down to the first floor, celebrating with screams as they lifted the last travel bag onto the off-road vehicle.
0:7:18|0:7:26|The off-road vehicle sped out, slowing down as it reached the entrance of the parking lot. The back door opened, and the accomplice waiting to escape seized the opportunity and leaped into the car.
0:7:26|0:7:30|At the same time, the police car arrived at the scene, and the officers got out of the car with their guns drawn, ready to face the enemy.
0:7:32|0:7:40|The barrier in the parking lot was raised, and the ruthless bandits crashed into the police car, using the raised barrier as a stepping stone for the off-road vehicle to easily pass over.
0:7:40|0:7:50|The robbers in the car took off their masks one after another, already immersed in excitement, and then the police cars that arrived later launched a encirclement and interception against them.
0:7:50|0:7:59|Suddenly, a prison van rushed in from the side, attempting to intercept the robbers. At a critical moment, the robbers violently turned the steering wheel, maneuvered around, and successfully broke through the encirclement.
0:8:2|0:8:7|Governor Jiang received the order and accelerated from behind, driving side by side with the off-road vehicle.
0:8:7|0:8:12|Facing the collision with the police car, the robbers in the off-road vehicle shouted excitedly, enjoying the thrill of escape.
0:8:15|0:8:19|[Hong Jibiao] excitedly directed the driver to collide, causing the police car to lose control and only able to stop at the side of the road.
0:8:19|0:8:28|Another police car took advantage of the situation and got sandwiched between two off-road vehicles, being hit from both front and back, and crashed onto the road.
0:8:36|0:8:47|[Hong Jibiao] took out his phone, and [Zhang Zaishan] finally noticed the taxi outside the window. A number was dialed, and the taxi instantly exploded, overturning the prison van that had rushed over.
0:8:47|0:8:54|The blazing prison van blocked the road, preventing the police from pursuing.
0:9:4|0:9:14|In this situation, police cars are continuously driving onto the pedestrian crossing. On the narrow pedestrian crossing, the police cars are in hot pursuit, with the chief on the car looking anxious. One police car after another drives over the green belt.
0:9:14|0:9:20|Back to the street. At this moment, the bandits' off-road vehicle turns into an open-air parking lot.
0:9:22|0:9:30|The police chief's orders came over the radio, and the police car quickly turned, drifting to a stop. The off-road vehicle, without any pursuers, accelerated through the parking lot.
0:9:30|0:9:37|The detouring prison van was suddenly blocked by a small bus that pulled out in front. The prison van quickly swerved to avoid it, but the police car behind crashed into it.
0:9:37|0:9:41|In the car, [Hong Jibiao] took out his phone, ready to detonate.
0:9:48|0:9:56|The police car quickly circled around and headed towards the exit of the parking lot. [Hong Jibiao] tried to pick up the phone, but was stopped by [Zhang Zaishan], and finally managed to grab the phone.
0:10:0|0:10:8|Two cars were blown up instantly and crashed onto the prison van. A police car rushed towards the exit of the parking lot, with the off-road vehicle narrowly avoiding it.
0:10:9|0:10:19|[Zhang Zaishan] shot the driver in the arm, and the police car took the opportunity to ram into it, trapping the car. [Hong Jipeng] in the front car looked on in despair as his brother's car was stuck, while the police car made him unable to linger.
0:10:50|0:10:55|At that moment, the bandits in the other car had lost their previous arrogance and just wanted to escape smoothly.
0:11:0|0:11:6|Governor Jiang cursed under his breath in the car. The police car and the prisoner transport were chasing closely behind, the off-road vehicle smoothly turned into the tunnel, while the prisoner transport was in trouble.
0:11:7|0:11:12|The tunnel's height limit trapped it in place, unable to move, with only the sedan left to pursue.
0:11:12|0:11:15|[Hong Jipeng] suddenly pressed the remote control.
0:11:16|0:11:24|The bomb stuck to the top of the tunnel exploded, causing the ground to collapse and burying the car under rocks instantly. At the same time, a deep trench was also blasted out of the ground.
0:11:24|0:11:29|The surrounding police cars had to give up. [Governor Jiang] got out of the car safely, but not without a scare.
0:11:29|0:11:34|Just as he closed the car door, he saw an off-road vehicle coming out of the next intersection.
0:11:41|0:11:44|He smashed the car door in rage, then squatted on the ground in pain.
0:11:46|0:11:49|The losses were so heavy, yet they couldn't catch the mastermind or protect the property, leaving him feeling defeated.
0:11:49|0:11:59|The police officer shouted as he opened the trunk. It has to be said that these robbers are ruthless, even setting up a timed bomb in their own car. [Zhang Zaishan] walked slowly towards them.
0:11:59|0:12:15|Bundles of detonators, attached with timers and flashing indicator lights, were seen. After the crowd dispersed, [Zhang Zaishan] in heavy protective gear, carrying a toolbox, stepped forward. At this moment, he was a lone warrior, protecting lives with his own, a bomb disposal expert. The title of the movie then appeared on the screen.
0:12:15|0:12:26|Six months later, at the Hong Kong Inspectorate Headquarters, police cars slowly drove out as officers walked towards the building. Inside the building, the explosives handling class was about to begin.
0:14:5|0:14:11|In a bar at night, young people sway their bodies, exuding hormones, as the resident performers take the stage.
0:14:11|0:14:18|At the bar, [Zhang Zaishan] lights the foreign liquor in the glass, tilts his head back and drinks it down. The foreign beauty next to him flirts subtly.
0:14:38|0:14:44|Drunk [Jia Wen] gazed at [Zhang Zaishan] with a hazy look of rare admiration in her eyes, then turned and walked onto the stage.
0:14:58|0:15:2|After causing trouble on stage, [Jia Wen] finished and went to the roadside to vomit.
0:15:2|0:15:13|[Zhang Zaishan] happened to pass by and saw this scene. He reached out to stop a taxi. Just as he got into the car and before the driver started, the door on the other side of the back seat opened, and [Jia Wen] got in.
0:15:13|0:15:19|She closed the car door, gazed at [Zhang Zaishan] with a dazed expression, and then collapsed into his arms.
0:15:21|0:15:28|In the lounge, [Jia Wen] lay on the sofa, her knee-length skirt highlighting her elegant temperament, with her long legs particularly eye-catching.
0:15:48|0:15:52|The policewoman placed the file in front of [Officer Zhang], who opened it to check.
0:15:52|0:15:58|[Officer Zhang] remembered the address and workplace. On that day, in the parking lot,
0:15:58|0:16:10|[Zhang Zaishan] opened the trunk, receiving an urgent mission. He quickly took off his coat, slung the equipment from the trunk, added a small bag, and picked up his leather boots. On the construction site, he measured the size of the bomb.
0:16:43|0:16:54|[Zhang Zaishan]'s fearless look in the face of death impressed his partner [A Bin] on the spot. He picked up his tools and headed towards the most dangerous direction without hesitation. Outside the construction site, police officers blocked reporters and dispersed the crowd.
0:16:54|0:17:3|In a construction site separated by a wall, [Zhang Zaishan] carried a box, wore a helmet, and began his task. He squatted in a deep pit, took off his gloves, and gently scraped this ancient bomb with a small knife.
0:17:3|0:17:6|The rust at the very front falls off quickly and cleanly.
0:17:6|0:17:15|Colleagues from the Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit could only watch from afar through binoculars. One of them held a utility knife and gently carved a cross along the ruler on the bomb's head.
0:17:15|0:17:20|Then he compared the scale on the ruler with the drill bit, and finally pulled out a piece of special tape to wrap around the bottom of the drill bit.
0:17:26|0:17:33|Control the length of the drill bit, [Zhang Zaishan] is concentrating on drilling the fuse hole. As the drill bit rotates, the soil beneath the bomb starts to fall.
0:17:33|0:17:39|[Zhang Zaishan] stopped the drill with a piercing gaze, causing his colleagues in the distance to hold their breath.
0:17:39|0:17:45|Through the telescope, they stared at Zhang Zaishan, who had stopped moving in the deep pit. Zhang Zaishan tentatively pressed the drill bit.
0:17:45|0:17:54|Sure enough, the surrounding soil blocks slid down again. He seemed determined to test his luck against the heavens. [A Bin] tightly held the binoculars, sweating on his behalf.
0:17:54|0:18:16|The drill finally stopped, [Zhang Zaishan] took out a cloth and wiped the bullet head. Then, he inserted the prepared hose into the cross, tightly wrapped the metal head at the front end of the hose, and the other end connected to the hose was a hydraulic pot. The viscous liquid in the pot was a solidifying agent, the purpose of which was to transport the solidifying agent into the detonator through the hose in a flowing manner, solidifying the detonator and preventing the explosives from being detonated.
0:18:17|0:18:24|[Zhang Zaishan] speaks through the walkie-talkie.
0:18:28|0:18:34|In the distance, [A Bin] entrusted all trust to [Zhang Zaishan], only to see him pick up a wrench, tighten the warhead, and slowly twist it.
0:18:34|0:18:42|The thick bullet of the water bottle slowly slides out as it rotates. The wrench twists round and round, as if it's not the bullet being twisted, but everyone's hearts.
0:18:42|0:18:51|Finally, the threaded part has been turned completely. Next, all that needs to be done is to pull it out to consider it a success. [Zhang Zaishan] moves his hands to relax his muscles and tendons as much as possible.
0:18:51|0:19:3|The bomb, which has been buried for a long time and covered in rust, may cause the fuse to no longer be straight. It's not easy to pull it out. A slight mistake could detonate the bomb, leaving no remains.
0:19:3|0:19:7|[Zhang Zaishan] squatted down, one hand holding the front end of the bomb, slowly pulling out the fuse with the other hand.
0:19:7|0:19:13|The rust and the bullet casing metal rubbed slowly against each other, and finally, the fuse was completely pulled out.
0:19:13|0:19:21|[Zhang Zaishan] carefully examined the uneven and rusty detonator in his hand, heaved a sigh of relief, and a relaxed smile appeared on his face. The detonator was then placed into the iron box.
0:19:21|0:19:26|[A Bin] was startled.
0:20:49|0:20:56|After saying that, she looked at [Zhang Zaishan] apologetically. After a moment of eye contact, [Jia Wen] looked out the window and spoke.
0:21:12|0:21:17|[Zhang Zaishan] vetoed it immediately and looked at [Jia Wen]. [Jia Wen] looked at him with some surprise. [Zhang Zaishan] awkwardly smiled.
0:21:20|0:21:24|The car drove towards the bridge, and the relationship between the two people began to change from here.
0:21:24|0:21:35|A year later on the Thai-Myanmar border, several military off-road vehicles drove along the small road, while mercenaries at the outpost waited with AK47s. A team approached and began the trade, unloading wooden crates from the vehicles.
0:21:35|0:21:46|The room was filled with explosives. The other party in the deal was [Hong Jipeng], who wore sunglasses. He took out two stacks of US dollars from his travel bag and sniffed them with satisfaction.
0:21:46|0:21:50|On the wall, old newspapers printed with the news of his brother's arrest serve as a reminder to him.
0:22:6|0:22:11|After more than a year of accumulation, he began to wage war against the police.
0:22:23|0:22:30|After reaching an agreement, the wealthy businessman waved goodbye as he left on the boat.
0:22:32|0:22:39|Amidst enthusiastic applause, [Zhang Zaishan] strode confidently onto the stage in a smart uniform. The host on stage pinned a medal to his chest.
0:22:39|0:22:44|[Zhang Zaishan] turned around and saluted, winning rounds of applause.
0:22:46|0:22:53|He pointed to [Officer Zhou], who gave him a thumbs up, and then pointed to [Governor Jiang]. The governor praised him with gestures.
0:24:11|0:24:18|The awards ceremony ended with applause, and at the subsequent reception, [Zhang Zaishan] stood tall in front of [Jia Wen].
0:25:11|0:25:16|Turning around, [Zhang Zaishan] took [Jia Wen]'s hand and they walked side by side, looking into each other's eyes with smiles.
0:25:16|0:25:19|Officer Zhou also started the car, but unexpectedly.
0:25:21|0:25:29|[Jia Wen] was frightened and quickly hid in the arms of [Zhang Zaishan]. The explosion was from [Officer Zhou]'s car, and other officers rushed to the scene.
0:25:32|0:25:42|Officer Zhou's car was engulfed in flames, with Jia Wen clinging to Zhang Zaishan in fear. Meanwhile, a camera in the shadows was aimed at the couple, capturing a photo.
0:25:42|0:25:50|In the hospital morgue, the [doctor] opens the metal cabinet, standing beside it are [Zhang Zaishan] and the spouse of [Officer Zhou].
0:25:50|0:25:56|[Doctor] slowly pushes out the body bag and unzips it. [Zhang Zaishan] looks serious, frowning.
0:25:56|0:26:0|Seeing Officer Zhou in such a state, his lover couldn't help but burst into tears.
0:26:6|0:26:14|In the corridor, Governor Jiang stood in front of the window like still water. When Zhang Zaishan walked out, he handed him a report and said heavily.
0:27:19|0:27:24|In front of the courthouse building, there is a landmark platform with a large cardboard box on it, on which is written, "Caution: Bomb."
0:27:44|0:27:51|The door of the bomb disposal unit's carriage opens, lowering a tracked remote control mechanical arm.
0:27:51|0:27:57|[A Bin] remotely controls the mechanical arm to move forward, heading towards the direction of the bomb. [Zhang Zaishan] looks around the perimeter of the cordon.
0:27:57|0:28:2|Outside the cordon, Governor Jiang nervously watched the situation on the scene. The mechanical arm slowly ascended the steps.
0:28:2|0:28:8|[Zhang Zaishan] approached [A Bin] to observe the operation. He saw the mechanical arm extend and lift the lid of the cardboard box.
0:28:8|0:28:18|The simple cardboard box is opened, revealing an electric rice cooker inside. Watching the ordinary rice cooker through the surveillance footage, [A Bin] controls the camera to get a closer look.
0:28:42|0:28:51|[Zhang Zaishan] turned around and looked at the bomb not far away. Soon his colleagues took out the prepared protective suit and first put it on his legs. [Zhang Zaishan] put on the headgear that only exposed his face, and then,
0:28:51|0:28:58|Two officers carried over a heavy coat together, and [Zhang Zaishan] put it on, making him look extremely bulky, like he was wearing a spacesuit.
0:29:2|0:29:9|[Zhang Zaishan] handed the walkie-talkie to [A Bin]. His colleague helped him put on the explosion-proof helmet, while [A Bin] secured the thick neck protection pad for him.
0:29:14|0:29:22|[A Bin] said, putting the bomb disposal tools into the small bag on [Zhang Zaishan]'s chest. After finishing all this, the two encouraged each other with gestures, [A Bin] patted his shoulder to signal the departure.
0:29:25|0:29:37|[Zhang Zaishan], wearing a heavy protective suit, strides steadily towards the bomb as onlookers watch. Outside the cordon, [Governor Jiang] nervously looks at his back, with sunlight streaming through the city's high-rise buildings.
0:29:37|0:29:48|And not far away, on another building, a telescope is set up by the window, monitoring every move of [Zhang Zaishan]. Yes, this person is [Hong Jipeng], with a fierce look on his face.
0:29:48|0:29:58|And here, before the rice cooker bomb, [Zhang Zaishan] knelt down and reached out his hands towards the mercury U-tube, which was wrapped with a large piece of chewing gum to cover the tube.
0:30:1|0:30:7|At the same time, once the chewing gum is taken, [Zhang Zaishan]'s gloves will be stuck. In the hotel lobby, [Hong Jipeng] is secretly observing.
0:30:11|0:30:16|[Zhang Zaishan] took off the gloves with gum stuck on them, flexed his fingers, and carefully peeled off another piece of gum.
0:30:16|0:30:21|And the hand that took off the mask gently pressed on the top of the rice cooker to ensure its stability.
0:30:22|0:30:34|Another piece of gum was torn off, and then he took off his gloves and checked the time, watching as the drops of mercury fell one by one from the U-shaped tube.
0:31:0|0:31:5|Someone climbed onto the flower bed across the building. Governor Jiang spotted them.
0:31:9|0:31:13|[Zhang Zaishan] had to put down his work as the dropping mercury reminded him of the urgency of time.
0:31:14|0:31:21|[Hong Jipeng] smiled and said. At this moment, he was still monitoring the movements of [Zhang Zaishan].
0:31:32|0:31:41|[A Bin] gestured and said. The caterpillar track is the mechanical arm, which also brought liquid nitrogen at this time. [Zhang Zaishan] gently took it and then turned the valve to its nozzle.
0:31:41|0:31:56|Take aim at the U-shaped tube. Soon, liquid nitrogen will completely freeze the U-shaped tube. [Zhang Zaishan] took out a folding pliers from the pocket in front of his chest.
0:31:56|0:32:7|Upon opening it, he took a deep breath and knocked towards the U-shaped tube. The empty glass tube on one side shattered, while on the other side filled with mercury, he chose to clamp it off with pliers. In front of the tall building, [Hong Jipeng] spoke.
0:32:9|0:32:17|[Zhang Zaishan] breathed a sigh of relief. [A Bin] also perked up.
0:32:22|0:32:33|Governor Jiang cheers excitedly. In the hotel building, Hong Jipeng packs up his things, slings his bag over his shoulder, and strides out the door, preparing for the next step of his plan. Zhang Zaishan takes off his protective suit.
0:32:43|0:32:50|The officer handed over the coffee. At this moment, a remote-controlled small truck drove through the blind alley.
0:32:50|0:32:57|[A Bin] and his colleagues stepped forward to inspect. The small package on the truck's cargo bed fell off due to the bumps.
0:33:10|0:33:16|At the courthouse entrance, [Governor Jiang] rushes over. [Zhang Zaishan] stops him. As he speaks, he squats down, getting a closer look.
0:33:43|0:33:46|Governor Jiang picked up the bomb and ran to the car. Zhang Zaishan was going to defuse the bomb, while Governor Jiang was in charge of driving. With a reverse gear, the car shot out onto the street.
0:33:46|0:33:58|Following that, the accelerator was pressed to the floor, roaring forward. Disregarding traffic rules on the road, [Governor Jiang] sharply turned the steering wheel, causing the car to drift sideways, sliding into a curve, then turning into another street, starting to drive against traffic to avoid oncoming vehicles. Holding a bomb, [Zhang Zaishan]
0:34:15|0:34:24|The car rushed out of the tunnel and onto the sidewalk, performing a sharp drift to a stop. [Governor Jiang] grabbed the bomb and dashed out of the car.
0:34:31|0:34:38|[Zhang Zaishan] takes a photo of the bomb.
0:34:42|0:34:46|Governor Jiang desperately threw the bomb in the final second before the explosion.
0:34:47|0:34:53|An explosion sent up a huge splash of water, instantly soaking the two. They wiped the water off their faces.
0:34:55|0:34:58|[Zhang Zaishan] took out his phone and looked at the photo.
0:35:36|0:35:41|In the early morning, [Zhang Zaishan] lay in bed, holding [Jia Wen], gently playing with her hair, staring out the window in a daze.
0:35:41|0:35:48|[Jia Wen] slowly turned around and looked at the man who was walking on the edge of life and death. She extended her arms and nestled into the man's embrace.
0:35:48|0:35:54|Every time he goes on a mission, [Jia Wen] is always on edge, and the two of them embrace each other in bed like this.
0:35:54|0:36:4|[Zhang Zaishan] rested his face against [Jia Wen]'s forehead, as if pondering something. [Jia Wen] anxiously asked.
0:36:6|0:36:11|[Zhang Zaishan] was absent-mindedly staring into space. [Jia Wen] gently brushed his face and said. He nodded slightly.
0:36:16|0:36:21|[Zhang Zaishan] responded softly, then slowly lowered his head. [Jia Wen] timely brought her lips close,
0:36:21|0:36:31|The two embraced and kissed. After a while of affection, [Jia Wen] went to the kitchen to prepare breakfast. She was wearing pajamas and opened the refrigerator.
0:36:32|0:36:41|Reaching out for a box of eggs, closing the refrigerator door, walking to the microwave, placing the eggs down, and then pulling open the upper cabinet.
0:36:42|0:36:50|Just as he opened the takeout box, [Zhang Zaishan] saw [Zhang Zaishan] approaching. [Zhang Zaishan] shook his head at the words.
0:36:56|0:37:2|[Jia Wen] chuckled lightly. [Zhang Zaishan] opened the stove and lifted the pot to check the fire.
0:37:2|0:37:11|Zhang Zaishan then picked up the oil bottle, opened the lid and poured it into the hot pot. Jia Wen, who was beside him, looked at him tenderly. Zhang Zaishan then took two eggs and put them in a plate.
0:37:11|0:37:16|[Jia Wen] looked at him and said. [Zhang Zaishan] smiled and gestured with a chicken egg.
0:37:19|0:37:26|After saying that, both of them laughed. [Zhang Zaishan] shook the oil in the hot pot lightly, while [Jia Wen] took a sip of water and said.
0:38:15|0:38:18|[Jia Wen] looked up at [Zhang Zaishan] deeply and shook her head gently.
0:38:18|0:38:27|In the bedroom, two pairs of slippers lay quietly in front of the bed, next to them, there were the untidy meal plates. On the bed, [Zhang Zaishan] hugged [Jia Wen] from behind.
0:38:27|0:38:34|The two of them guarded each other tacitly, showing their affection in the end. Disarming the bomb, such a high-risk job requires a resilient heart.
0:39:7|0:39:12|Two pairs of characters launched attacks. [Huang Tiannuo] suddenly made a move, jumping up to deliver a smashing kill.
0:39:46|0:39:48|The traffic is flowing heavily at this moment.
0:39:48|0:40:0|As one of the busiest tunnels in Hong Kong and even the world, there is no shortage of traffic even at night. A large truck drove by, suddenly opening its back door and pouring out a box full of ping pong balls.
0:40:8|0:40:17|The floor covered with ping pong balls severely affected the driving of cars. The two-way Red Survey Tunnel has now become one-way, causing an immediate traffic jam on the road.
0:40:17|0:40:27|Road management personnel on site are organizing traffic flow, with only the other lane still operational, clearly indicating deliberate sabotage. On the tourist bus, the tour guide is informing the passengers.
0:41:8|0:41:15|The tourist bus slowly entered the tunnel. On the other side, at the entrance and exit of the Red Survey Undersea Tunnel on Hong Kong Island, the traffic flow was much less compared to before.
0:41:15|0:41:21|At this moment, a box truck drives into the tunnel. The driver speaks into the walkie-talkie, saying they have arrived at the location. The person who responds to him is [Hong Jipeng].
0:41:30|0:41:38|The truck driver turned the direction and blocked the road, obstructing the passing vehicles. At the other end of the tunnel, another truck did the same.
0:41:38|0:41:44|Suddenly turning around, causing a chain collision of cars in the tunnel.
0:41:47|0:41:51|Mercenaries emerged from the truck compartment, frightening the passengers on the bus.
0:42:18|0:42:23|At this moment, the tunnel is in chaos. The tour guide takes the opportunity to get off the bus and check the situation, but unexpectedly.
0:43:9|0:43:18|Mercenaries are controlling the scene. On the other side, the police who received a call from the tunnel center immediately responded. Police cars, motorcycles, and prisoner transport vehicles were dispatched one after another, sirens blaring and alarm lights flashing.
0:43:59|0:44:2|Mercenaries upload photos to the Robin Hood operation on the computer.
0:44:2|0:44:10|This is a well-organized and disciplined terrorist attack. Mercenaries are placing bombs on the escape door, with the fuse tied to the door handle.
0:44:13|0:44:16|The surveillance footage captured this scene.
0:44:16|0:44:24|As the mercenaries opened fire, the surveillance cameras were destroyed one by one. The people in the tunnel center became even more panicked, and the tunnel was plunged into paralysis.
0:44:49|0:44:56|In the police car command room, everyone speculates about the attack. Before long, the police cars arriving at the scene have already formed a line, and [Governor Jiang] gets out of the car.
0:45:6|0:45:12|Governor Jiang decisively gave orders to the person in charge of the tunnel center. At this moment, the vehicle from the bomb disposal unit slowly came to a stop.
0:45:12|0:45:16|[Zhang Zaishan] got off the car and spoke to the soldiers behind him.
0:45:18|0:45:28|He turned and ran towards the center of the tunnel. At this moment, there were no vehicles passing through the tunnel entrance, instead, there were police cars and armed police officers.
0:45:29|0:45:37|Media reporters were also on site, ready for live broadcast. In the tunnel, mercenaries hid behind the car doors with guns, and the two sides were facing off.
0:45:48|0:45:55|In front of the monitoring screen at the orbit center, everyone stared intently. Zhang Zaishan said.
0:45:58|0:46:4|The scene slowly advances, [Zhang Zaishan] recognizes [Huo Bao], who is [Hong Jipeng]. He is holding a gun.
0:46:6|0:46:12|After speaking, [Zhang Zaishan] glanced at [Governor Jiang]. [Governor Jiang] also bent down and carefully examined it.
0:46:53|0:47:1|At the scene in the tunnel, maintenance workers wearing helmets and vests run towards the police car.
0:47:2|0:47:7|A burst of gunfire, mercenaries hit two people, and the police immediately returned fire.
0:47:7|0:47:15|Journalists and media personnel panicked and fled in confusion. In the tunnel, mercenaries shouted at the hostages.
0:47:20|0:47:29|At the entrance of the tunnel, both sides were hiding behind cars and engaging in continuous gunfire. Bullets grazed the car, sparking flames, and in the blink of an eye, the car serving as cover was riddled with bullet holes.
0:47:29|0:47:36|At this moment, [Governor Jiang] rushed to the front of the car, and the mercenaries, well-prepared, had firepower that was no less than that of the fully equipped police officers.
0:47:36|0:47:42|Governor Jiang took the opportunity to slip into the car, starting the sedan and driving through the roadblock towards the tunnel.
0:47:45|0:47:51|The director of the action department in the rear gives orders. In the car, [Governor Jiang] drives with one hand on the steering wheel and the other hand shooting continuously.
0:47:51|0:48:0|The suicidal act was quickly thwarted by smashing the car window. [Governor Jiang] took the opportunity to jump out of the car and hide in a medium-sized sedan. He started the car again and drove towards the injured maintenance worker.
0:48:0|0:48:7|The car that crashed into the tunnel entrance earlier briefly drew fire, and Governor Jiang, seizing the opportunity, has already arrived by the maintenance personnel.
0:48:7|0:48:11|Mercenaries increased manpower and firepower, preventing [Governor Jiang] from getting off the car to rescue people.
0:48:12|0:48:15|[A Bin] is now driving the car, preparing to help Governor Jiang break through the encirclement.
0:48:26|0:48:33|[A Bin] quickly started the car, while [Huo Bao] threw a grenade. The previous car was instantly destroyed by the explosion.
0:48:35|0:48:41|The raging fire engulfed the car with only the iron frame left. [Huo Bao] dialed the public phone in the tunnel.
0:49:6|0:49:17|[Jia Wen] saw the TV report and sent a text message to [Zhang Zaishan].
0:49:27|0:49:39|She remembered the story of a superhero, then picked up her phone to continue editing. As [Zhang Zaishan], who was about to go out for negotiations, heard the phone ring, he took it out and saw that it was [Jia Wen] who sent four words: "I trust you."
0:49:39|0:49:45|[Zhang Zaishan] put away his phone, opened the door, and walked out quickly. [Governor Jiang] patted him on the back, signaling him to be careful.
0:49:45|0:49:55|[Zhang Zaishan] walked towards the tunnel empty-handed, not even wearing a bulletproof vest. The less than a hundred meters distance seemed unusually long due to the standoff between the two sides.
0:49:55|0:50:13|In the concerned gaze of the police officers, he remained resolute and stepped into the most dangerous place. The mercenaries on the steps were particularly vigilant as the bomb disposal expert approached, with the gun pointed at him all the time. [Zhang Zaishan] looked around but was unexpectedly attacked from behind by a mercenary, who pushed him hard.
0:50:16|0:50:23|Immediately after that, being firmly pressed to the ground, another mercenary stepped forward to search him, and [Huo Bao] was not in a good mood.
0:50:23|0:50:35|He kicked Zhang Zaishan hard on the head, then squatted down in front of him, pinching his chin to lift it up. The kick just now made Zhang Zaishan's brow bleed profusely, and he was slowly dragged up.
0:51:8|0:51:13|On the bus, Director Chen was dragged off and the mercenaries took him to [Huo Bao].
0:51:15|0:51:22|Huo Bao handed the gun to Zhang Zaishan as he spoke.
0:51:22|0:51:26|After taking the pistol, [Huo Bao] glanced at General Chen.
0:51:39|0:51:44|[Huo Bao] sprayed the car with bullets, frightening the hostages inside.
0:52:45|0:52:52|Upon hearing this, [Zhang Zaishan] closed his eyes in agony.
0:52:52|0:52:58|The hostage who was just killed in the gunfire, he saw it with his own eyes. [Huo Bao] is unreasonable, there is no other way but to compromise.
0:53:1|0:53:11|Huo Bao lowered his head in thought for a moment, patting Zhang Zaishan on the shoulder.
0:53:23|0:53:29|[Huo Bao] gritted his teeth. [Zhang Zaishan] listened with a vacant look in his eyes.
0:53:30|0:53:36|[Huo Bao] pushed [Zhang Zaishan] aside, glaring at him fiercely until he turned and walked towards the exit of the tunnel.
0:53:49|0:53:54|After cleaning up the wound, [Zhang Zaishan] returned to the command center and interrupted the engineer.
0:55:0|0:55:7|The brightly lit harbor, with fishing boats still sailing, a helicopter flew across the night sky towards the helipad on a distant high-rise building.
0:55:36|0:55:39|The prison guard handed the file to [Governor Jiang], while [Zhang Zaishan] listened on the side.
0:55:39|0:55:46|[Hong Jibiao] was brought over in handcuffs and leg irons, his gaze fixed on [Zhang Zaishan] who was surprisingly gentle as he escorted him into the prison.
0:55:47|0:55:53|[Zhang Zaishan] gave a glance. The two officers escorted him into the car, time waits for no one, and the prisoner van headed straight for the Red Tunnel.
0:55:53|0:55:59|The atmosphere in the car was quite heavy. [Zhang Zaishan] turned around and said. Upon hearing this, [Hong Jibiao] was stunned on the spot.
0:56:9|0:56:14|[Hong Jibiao] suddenly struggled, and the prison guard immediately pressed him down. [Zhang Zaishan] and [Governor Jiang] turned around to stare at him.
0:56:58|0:57:6|The large truck rushing out of the intersection overturned the prison van on the spot.
0:57:14|0:57:20|Sitting by the phone in the tunnel, [Hong Jipeng] calmly picked up the receiver, lazily saying.
0:57:26|0:57:33|[Yin Xiaofeng] helplessly hung up the phone, noticing that it was already 11:51 PM, leaving little time for the police.
0:57:33|0:57:40|The phone rang again in the tunnel, and [Huo Bao] calmly answered the call.
0:57:53|0:57:57|Impatient [Huo Bao] is smashing the phone booth with a receiver, while over here.
0:58:4|0:58:9|Yin Xiaofeng hurried to the monitoring station.
0:58:19|0:58:24|In the tunnel, [Huo Bao] raised his AK and aimed at him. At exactly 12 o'clock, a gunshot rang out, and the hostage fell to the ground.
0:58:24|0:58:31|The phone rang in the command center, and [Yin Xiaofeng] answered. [Huo Bao] hung up the phone.
0:58:33|0:58:39|On the tour bus, everyone was shocked to see this scene. [Zhang Zaishan]'s phone rang, and the caller was [Yin Xiaofeng].
0:58:42|0:58:45|[Zhang Zaishan] looked up and saw [Hong Jibiao] wearing an oxygen mask inside the ambulance.
0:58:45|0:58:49|Poor [Hong Jibiao] was seriously injured and was fixed on a stretcher.
0:59:2|0:59:11|After finishing the call, [Huo Bao] immediately hung up. He walked onto the bus, selecting his next target, moving slowly down the aisle, with each step causing fear and trepidation among the passengers.
0:59:11|0:59:23|He stopped in front of a young woman, who looked at him timidly. [Huo Bao] raised his submachine gun, aimed it at the woman's face, and checked the time with his hand.
0:59:23|0:59:35|Time passes second by second, and the woman is getting closer to death. In the command center, everyone watches the electronic clock, hoping to save one more life. Only a few seconds left.
0:59:35|0:59:43|Huo Bao's index finger is already on the trigger.
0:59:45|0:59:48|The tour guide answered the phone.
0:59:52|0:59:56|The woman looked at [Huo Bao] without daring to relax, while [Huo Bao] smirked and slowly revealed a smile.
0:59:56|1:0:3|He moved the gun away, got out of the car, and the woman finally breathed a sigh of relief. In front of the police car, [Zhang Zaishan] picked up the megaphone.
1:0:20|1:0:26|The tour guide raised both hands and shouted as he approached, seemingly holding something in his hands, making [Zhang Zaishan] nervous. When the tour guide walked in,
1:0:26|1:0:32|[Zhang Zaishan] signaled for him to stop, the tour guide looked a bit flustered and handed over his phone. After a brief inspection.
1:0:38|1:0:45|The tour guide walked towards the ambulance with a phone in hand, followed by [Zhang Zaishan] and [Governor Jiang]. The guide approached the stretcher shakily, slowly crouching down.
1:0:45|1:0:53|Lifted up the phone to record. With only his eyes bandaged, [Hong Jibiao] looked puzzled at the tour guide, while on the other end of the video, [Huo Bao] recognized that it was his younger brother.
1:0:53|1:1:0|After confirming, the tour guide got out of the ambulance, and [Huo Bao] felt relieved when he saw his younger brother. [Zhang Zaishan] shouted to [Huo Bao] through the video.
1:1:50|1:2:0|[Zhang Zaishan] heard this and shoved the megaphone into the car. Immediately, medical personnel slowly pushed [Hong Jibiao]'s stretcher out of the car, with [Zhang Zaishan] pushing the stretcher alone, walking towards the inside.
1:2:3|1:2:11|[Huo Bao] gave the order, and the guys rushed to help carry the stretcher. The cars blocking the road hindered the stretcher's progress, so they had to carry it through the steps on the side of the tunnel.
1:2:26|1:2:35|When the younger brother returned, [Huo Bao]'s temper softened a lot. He immediately ordered his men to release the hostages, then walked over to [Zhang Zaishan] and handed him a phone.
1:2:38|1:2:42|[Zhang Zaishan] took the phone when he heard the words, glanced at [Hong Jibiao], and turned away.
1:3:10|1:3:19|[Huang Tiannuo] looked determined, and his father beside him pulled him back. He gently patted his father's hand, got out of the car, only to drop his work ID on the ground.
1:3:20|1:3:25|The mercenary was stunned, closed the car door and bent down to pick up the items, while the father and uncles in the car were extremely nervous.
1:3:25|1:3:31|The mercenary slammed the documents hard onto [Huang Tiannuo]'s face, carefully comparing the photo on the documents before raising his gun.
1:3:51|1:3:58|The escaped hostages, under the arrangement of the police, boarded the prepared bus one after another.
1:3:58|1:4:4|The police officers at the entrance of the bus are counting one by one, while [Zhang Zaishan] sits exhausted and in pain on the steps by the roadside.
1:4:16|1:4:24|[Huang Tiannuo] walked over with a bomb strapped to him. [Zhang Zaishan] quickly got up and rushed over.
1:4:27|1:4:33|The people in the command center frowned as they watched the surveillance footage.
1:4:33|1:4:38|[Huang Tiannuo] raised his hands nervously and breathed heavily, [Zhang Zaishan] walked quickly towards him and introduced himself.
1:4:38|1:4:45|He gestured for [Huang Tiannuo] to raise his hand, and he did so.
1:4:56|1:5:1|[Zhang Zaishan] bent over and circled around behind [Huang Tiannuo], checked the route, and then circled back to the front.
1:5:8|1:5:14|The inquiring officer immediately responded, carrying the box and heading towards [Zhang Zaishan].
1:5:33|1:5:38|[Zhang Zaishan] turned on the flashlight and approached to observe carefully.
1:5:38|1:5:44|He reached out and fiddled with the complex lines around [Huang Tiannuo]'s waist, making [Huang Tiannuo] extremely nervous. He took a deep breath and looked up.
1:5:44|1:5:50|[Zhang Zaishan] is squatting, circling around him to find the route, he says with his head held high.
1:5:52|1:5:59|Huang Tiannuo's lips trembled, trying to remain calm. Just as he was about to cut the wire, Huang Tiannuo grabbed Zhang Zaishan's hand.
1:5:59|1:6:2|[Zhang Zaishan] patted his back to signal him to calm down.
1:6:2|1:6:8|Huang Tiannuo slowly released his hand, raised it again, and only then did Zhang Zaishan feel reassured to continue working.
1:6:8|1:6:17|He quickly cut the two wires cleanly without any explosion, giving Huang Tiannuo some confidence. [Zhang Zaishan] did not dare to slack off at all, and quickly circled around to his side.
1:6:25|1:6:28|The father in the car anxiously waited by the window.
1:6:28|1:6:35|Huo Bao, hiding in the shadows, secretly pressed the remote control.
1:7:22|1:7:25|[Zhang Zaishan] was struck by these words and stopped what he was doing.
1:7:25|1:7:36|With one minute left on the clock, [Zhang Zaishan] calmly watches the countdown.
1:7:36|1:7:41|Rising slowly, the two locked eyes, with [Zhang Zaishan] gripping his wrist.
1:8:43|1:8:51|The explosion's shockwave instantly shattered the car windows and sent [Zhang Zaishan] flying, he was harshly thrown onto the windshield and then back to the ground.
1:8:52|1:8:58|The car closer to the explosion was also flipped upside down. Inside the tunnel at this moment,
1:8:58|1:9:7|Huang Tiannuo's father and uncles stared with wide eyes, unable to calm down for a long time. The father in the passenger seat started crying first, everything happened too quickly.
1:9:7|1:9:15|In the command center, a female police officer covers her mouth and cries in pain.
1:9:15|1:9:22|Governor Jiang on the scene squatted down uncomfortably, while the officers on the second floor guardrail helplessly tapped on the railing.
1:9:22|1:9:29|The media reporters who used to love watching the excitement couldn't help but shed tears at this moment, touching everyone present.
1:9:29|1:9:35|The old father leaned against the car window, touching the watch that his son had just given him, heartbroken and tears streaming down his face.
1:9:35|1:9:43|[Zhang Zaishan] sat on the ground with a dirty face, leaning against the wheels of the bus, when his phone rang.
1:9:50|1:9:57|After speaking, [Hong Jipeng] in the tunnel hung up the phone.
1:9:57|1:10:4|After planning for so long, he finally let out a sigh of relief today, while [Zhang Zaishan] on the other end of the phone stared intently into the tunnel.
1:10:4|1:10:18|The pain climbed all over his face at this moment, he frowned tightly, stared, and watched the young life pass away in front of him, causing his facial expression to distort as if being suffocated, even though he was sitting, there was a feeling of breathlessness at this moment.
1:10:18|1:10:25|His chest heaved violently, filled with both unwillingness and helplessness, [Huang Tiannuo]'s police badge still intact.
1:10:25|1:10:38|In the photo, the young man with a sunny smile, the tunnel crisis coming to an end, at the command center table, [Zhang Zaishan] with red eyes, using a disinfectant wipe to clean the wound, [Governor Jiang] resting one hand on the table.
1:10:48|1:10:56|Governor Jiang, who almost came to blows, was firmly stopped by Zhang Zaishan.
1:10:57|1:11:3|He walked out quickly.
1:11:3|1:11:12|His heart on the verge of collapse, he howled in agony outside the door, causing [A Bin] at the command center to turn pale with trembling lips.
1:11:13|1:11:22|[Zhang Zaishan] pushed the door open and entered the safe passage. He held onto the handrail and walked down slowly, arriving next to Governor Jiang. Governor Jiang turned to look at him and said.
1:11:23|1:11:32|Tears welled up in his eyes as he spoke, and [Zhang Zaishan] sat down slowly beside him to offer comfort.
1:11:46|1:11:54|The bomb attack has become a nightmare for Governor Jiang, who covered his face and started crying again, worried about losing control of his emotions, then quickly wiped away the tears.
1:11:54|1:12:1|He took a deep breath to adjust his state, then turned his head and said. [Zhang Zaishan] stared at him in silence.
1:12:4|1:12:12|Governor Jiang urged him unwillingly, while Zhang Zaishan simply turned his head away, wiped away a tear, and then reached out to put his hand on Governor Jiang's shoulder.
1:12:12|1:12:20|The two brothers remained silent, just patting each other on the back for encouragement as the bus drove back home.
1:12:29|1:12:38|Another passenger grabbed the police officer from behind, and a wire cut into the officer's neck, drawing blood.
1:13:59|1:14:2|An armed helicopter slowly ascended into the air and flew towards the direction of the tunnel.
1:14:2|1:14:8|At dawn, the ferry on the sea started working, while the tunnel remained in a mess.
1:14:8|1:14:19|On top of the carriage, two mercenaries lay in wait, facing off against hundreds of fully armed officers. On the police side, after nearly a night of fighting, they had started to arrange shifts and rest for the personnel.
1:14:27|1:14:34|The bandits threw food into the car window, and [Huang Tiannuo]'s father was just about to have an outburst but was stopped. The hostage situation in Hong Tunnel has been going on for over 10 hours with no signs of resolution yet.
1:15:30|1:15:36|Mr. Yan and [Governor Jiang] engage in a confrontation.
1:16:30|1:16:37|In the tunnel, [Huo Bao] finished watching the news and felt great, handing a bottle of mineral water to the child in the car.
1:16:37|1:16:44|The mother nervously took the mineral water from the child's hand. Soon, [Huo Bao] arrived at [Huang Tiannuo]'s father's car.
1:16:44|1:16:51|He reached out and touched the watch on his father's wrist, glanced at the old man, and then said. The old man explained with wide eyes.
1:17:2|1:17:10|The old man, filled with grief over the loss of his son, hands the birthday gift from his son to the enemy. After receiving the watch, [Huo Bao] smiles and turns around.
1:17:10|1:17:16|The old man reluctantly watched his back as he left.
1:17:44|1:17:50|[Hong Jibiao] closed his eyes and pleaded.
1:19:21|1:19:28|He answered the call from [Huo Bao].
1:19:40|1:19:51|At night, the entrance of the tunnel was still guarded by police officers armed with live ammunition. They all wore bulletproof helmets and bulletproof vests. At the front of the formation were officers holding riot shields.
1:19:51|1:19:53|[Huo Bao] is definitely not able to break out by force.
1:20:7|1:20:15|[Zhang Zaishan] leaned against the guardrail on the side of the road, [Jia Wen]'s phone call didn't go through, but he didn't think much of it.
1:20:15|1:20:23|Ke Gang got up, and the phone rang again. This time, it was the phone left by [Hong Jipeng]. [Zhang Zaishan] picked up the phone to check the number.
1:20:23|1:20:29|After hesitating for a moment, [Zhang Zaishan] answered the phone. However, there was a long pause before any sound came from the other end of the line.
1:21:18|1:21:23|The phone call ended, [Zhang Zaishan] put down his phone and pondered, the clue might be the license plate number from that year.
1:21:23|1:21:31|He began to recall the scene of planting the bomb together, at the abandoned car recycling station, where he personally opened the trunk.
1:21:31|1:21:40|[Zhang Zaishan] furrowed his brow, closed his eyes, and tried hard to remember.
1:21:45|1:21:52|The police quickly launched a search, with an officer riding a motorcycle arriving at a gas station.
1:22:5|1:22:22|[Zhang Zaishan] got out of the car and strode towards the taxi. He first bent down to look through the car window, inspected the interior, found nothing unusual, then went to the trunk. He leaned over and pressed his ear against the trunk to make sure there was no ticking bomb, and then pried it open. Inside the car was [Jia Wen], who was tied up.
1:22:47|1:22:54|Jia Wen, who was crying anxiously, shook her head in fear, as Zhang Zaishan urged, "Jia Wen," she nodded with tears in her eyes.
1:22:54|1:22:59|[Zhang Zaishan] saw the situation and slowly inserted the pliers near the lock, then cut it with force.
1:22:59|1:23:10|The lock strap broke, but [Jia Wen] in the trunk was terrified. Then he cut the lock strap at her ankle, lifted [Jia Wen] up, and held her hand, saying.
1:23:16|1:23:24|After saying that, [Zhang Zaishan] let go of [Jia Wen]'s hand, causing her hands to tremble due to the excessive force. [Jia Wen] then switched to holding the grenade with one hand.
1:23:24|1:23:30|At the same time, he tightly wrapped the grenade and his hand together with tape, then said.
1:23:34|1:23:37|[Jia Wen] nodded tearfully. Outside the gas station at this moment, workers were pushing carts to bring sandbags.
1:23:37|1:23:45|With the joint efforts of five or six workers, sandbags were formed into a circle and continuously piled higher. The bomb disposal team's vehicle was also in position.
1:23:56|1:24:3|Jia Wen, whose emotions gradually calmed down, shook her head as she looked at Zhang Zaishan.
1:24:5|1:24:18|[Zhang Zaishan] walked towards the sandbag formation holding [Jia Wen]'s hand, just like the story he told at that time, the story about the girl's hand and the hand grenade. [Zhang Zaishan] looked at [Jia Wen] with a determined gaze as tears welled up in her eyes.
1:24:26|1:24:33|[Jia Wen] fixed her gaze on [Zhang Zaishan], waiting for those words to come out of his mouth.
1:24:33|1:24:39|Zhang Zaishan led her to the sandbag formation, holding Jia Wen's hand and slowly lifting it up.
1:24:46|1:24:48|[Jia Wen] nodded with tears in her eyes, not daring to take it lightly.
1:24:49|1:24:53|The tape was torn open, and [Zhang Zaishan] peeled it off layer by layer in circles.
1:24:55|1:25:3|Finally, as the duct tape was completely removed, [Zhang Zaishan] held her hand and approached the sandbag formation.
1:25:9|1:25:15|The moment the hand grenade was released, it exploded. [Zhang Zaishan] hugged her and ran towards the street.
1:25:15|1:25:25|The explosion's shockwave knocked the two down. Startled, [Jia Wen] burrowed into [Zhang Zaishan]'s arms. [Zhang Zaishan] held her tightly as they turned around to look at the sandbag barrier that had been blown up.
1:25:25|1:25:32|The clouds roll and the clouds disperse, another night has passed. At the entrance of the tunnel in the early morning, the officers are still holding their ground. The overturned car on the road,
1:25:32|1:25:38|Exhausted mercenaries in the tunnel were all silently hoping for the bomb crisis to end quickly.
1:25:44|1:25:48|After reaching a consensus, the old men with graying temples paid attention to the movements outside the car.
1:26:44|1:26:53|In the tunnel, [Hong Jipeng] makes a phone call. Meanwhile, in [Jia Wen]'s bedroom, [Zhang Zaishan] watches her sleeping.
1:26:53|1:26:58|He reached out to tidy up [Jia Wen]'s hair, then gently pushed her.
1:27:2|1:27:8|[Zhang Zaishan] had just stood up when he was embraced by [Jia Wen], who buried her head deeply in his shoulder. [Zhang Zaishan] also held her tightly.
1:27:9|1:27:19|[Zhang Zaishan] patted her back and answered softly. With the affirmative response, [Jia Wen] finally showed a natural smile on her face.
1:27:19|1:27:28|Jia Wen then reached into the bedside bag again, took out a small seal, and gently stamped it on Zhang Zaishan's hand back. The pattern was a thumbs-up gesture.
1:27:29|1:27:33|[Zhang Zaishan] was amused by her playful actions.
1:27:34|1:27:38|[Zhang Zaishan] just got up and left, then immediately turned back to kiss [Jia Wen] on the lips.
1:27:38|1:27:45|The kiss was deep and intense, as if trying to dispel all the previous unhappiness. After the kiss,
1:27:45|1:27:51|[Zhang Zaishan] got up and left, with a look of happiness on [Jia Wen]'s face. As he reached the door, [Zhang Zaishan] said to the officer.
1:27:53|1:28:10|Shortly after [Zhang Zaishan] walked through the foyer, he pressed the elevator button and waited. As he waited for the elevator, he took out his phone from his pocket and sent a text message to [Jia Wen], "Be happy if you can." The elevator arrived.
1:28:10|1:28:16|[Zhang Zaishan] walked into the elevator while looking at his phone, continuing to edit his text message. The elevator doors slowly closed.
1:28:16|1:28:23|[Zhang Zaishan] walked into the office and came face to face with [Yin Xiaofeng] and [Governor Jiang].
1:28:31|1:28:37|On the other side, [Yan Guorong] led a group of bodyguards downstairs. Just as the bodyguards opened the car door, an off-road vehicle rushed towards them.
1:28:46|1:28:50|Several bodyguards helped [Yan Guorong] quickly escape towards the building, but the criminals would not let him get away so easily.
1:28:50|1:29:1|Faced with a group of armed bandits, even though the bodyguards were armed, they were still firmly suppressed. Yan Guorong from Jinchuan had never seen such a scene before. The sound of gunfire and smoke filled the air, leaving him at a loss.
1:29:1|1:29:6|Yan Guorong, who had no one to help him, fell into the fountain pool as his bodyguards fell one after another.
1:29:10|1:29:16|The bandits took [Yan Guorong] into the car, the Mercedes quickly drove down the stairs and made a U-turn, stepping on the gas and leaving in a cloud of dust.
1:29:16|1:29:22|In a secret room, [Yan Guorong] sat on the ground with a gun pointed at his head.
1:29:41|1:29:48|The henchmen reported to [Hong Jipeng] over the phone. After completing the mission, they locked [Yan Guorong] in the truck compartment.
1:29:55|1:30:2|Once the bandits had completely left, they detonated the bomb on the truck and began [Hong Jipeng]'s helicopter rescue plan.
1:30:18|1:30:25|Dr. Niu opened the van door and bent down in front of his younger brother, who would then be picked up by someone.
1:30:27|1:30:34|The younger brother opened his mouth but couldn't speak. On the other side, [Zhang Zaishan] received a phone call.
1:31:13|1:31:19|[Zhang Zaishan] would not sit idly by, he arrived at the explosives warehouse, while [Hong Jipeng]'s helicopter was already heading towards the Red Tunnel.
1:31:19|1:31:30|Two planes flicker red lights in the night sky, surrounded by police at the scene of the red tunnel. [Zhang Zaishan] chooses to negotiate alone with [Hong Jipeng]. Governor Jiang at the tunnel entrance is holding his breath.
1:31:30|1:31:34|He preferred to confront head-on, then picked up the walkie-talkie by his collar.
1:31:38|1:31:48|In the tunnel, [Hong Jipeng] led the way, with mercenaries pushing [Hong Jibiao] closely behind, heading towards the tunnel entrance.
1:31:48|1:31:56|In the command room, [Yin Xiaofeng] watches [Zhang Zaishan] on the monitor. At this moment, he is striding towards the tunnel, with [Zhang Zaishan] walking confidently and quickly.
1:31:56|1:32:3|Facing the warning from the mercenaries, he raised his hand and shot one down.
1:32:23|1:32:35|The mercenaries surrounded him with guns, but dared not take a step forward. The atmosphere dropped to freezing point. Even a group of ruthless bandits who killed without blinking an eye were particularly nervous when their lives were at stake, except for [Hong Jipeng].
1:32:43|1:32:48|The mercenaries became nervous first, raising their guns one after another, ready to shoot [Zhang Zaishan] at any moment.
1:32:48|1:32:52|[Zhang Zaishan] looked at the mercenaries with a determined and fierce gaze.
1:33:3|1:33:10|Straightforwardly, they came for the money, not to lose their lives. Just as the three were about to leave, [Hong Jipeng] fired his gun first. [Zhang Zaishan] hid behind the car and shot [Hong Jipeng] in the thigh. Inside the tunnel, special police suddenly parachuted down.
1:33:10|1:33:21|Outside the tunnel, at the command of [Governor Jiang], the police officers immediately sprang into action. Meanwhile, police officers from Hong Kong Island rushed towards the tunnel from the other end, where three elderly men were trapped in a car.
1:33:21|1:33:32|[Huang Tiannuo]'s father, who had been waiting for a long time, made up his mind to die with his empty wrist. The special police suppressed with rifle firepower, while [Hong Jipeng], who got the money, just wanted to leave safely.
1:33:45|1:33:52|With only his henchman pushing the stretcher of [Hong Jibiao], [Zhang Zaishan] shouted towards the passengers inside the car.
1:33:53|1:34:0|Well-trained officers lined up and ran in the tunnel, while the hired mercenaries, who were already trapped, were still fighting back.
1:34:10|1:34:14|He directed the evacuation of hostages, while the special police were responsible for the main suppression, and the mercenaries fought back while retreating, with the battle space continuously shrinking.
1:34:18|1:34:29|On the bus, the hostages rushed off in panic. [Hong Jipeng]'s henchman hid behind the car and opened fire, but all the bullets were blocked by the bulletproof shield. [Zhang Zaishan], who was hiding behind the car, glanced at his watch, realizing that he didn't have much time left.
1:34:29|1:34:39|After evacuating the hostages, Governor Jiang led his team to catch up. At the entrance of the Hung Hom Tunnel, a helicopter arrived to pick up Hong Jipeng. As the military helicopter hovered above, the pilot immediately raised his hands in surrender.
1:34:39|1:34:45|As the helicopter from Jiulongkou landed, it was immediately surrounded by police officers, with special forces holding rifles and shouting commands.
1:34:49|1:34:57|The foreign driver surrendered before getting off the plane. Inside the Hong Tunnel, chaos ensued as cars were stuck on the main road, with hostages fleeing in panic between the vehicles.
1:34:57|1:35:2|On this side near Kowloon, the special police and officers are suppressing firepower while steadily advancing.
1:35:2|1:35:8|The hostages, fleeing in panic, screamed in terror, while the mercenaries attempting to escape fell one after another in the gunfire.
1:35:8|1:35:11|Governor Jiang evacuates the remaining hostages.
1:35:11|1:35:15|[Zhang Zaishan], who was slowly approaching the car, finally found [Hong Jipeng] through the glass.
1:35:15|1:35:26|A gunshot rang out, [Hong Jipeng] shattered the glass obstructing [Zhang Zaishan]'s line of sight. In the chaos, the younger brothers had no time to attend to [Hong Jibiao] on the stretcher, while the old men hiding in the car waited for the opportunity to drive away.
1:35:26|1:35:37|In the face of disaster, [Hong Jibiao], who was unable to act, was left in the middle of the road. Suddenly, a bullet hit his body, causing blood to spray everywhere. The fleeing mercenaries even collided with the stretcher, causing it to spin on the road.
1:35:37|1:35:41|The mercenary opened the car door as cover, and [Governor Jiang] shot him dead.
1:35:41|1:35:49|The mercenaries who were escaping arrived at the car door, and the old men had clear division of labor, then they directed the hostages in the car to escape.
1:35:49|1:35:55|One person locks the throat from the car, another person seizes the gun, while another person attacks head-on.
1:35:55|1:36:0|The fleeing hostage hastily pulled open the escape door, only to inadvertently trigger the fuse and be engulfed by the explosion.
1:36:8|1:36:18|[A Bin], who was leading the charge, suddenly ran out of bullets. He then jumped onto a car, tackled two enemies to the ground, seized a handgun, and ended their lives.
1:36:24|1:36:35|The gangsters also targeted Governor Jiang, sneaking up to the second floor of the bus from the other staircase. Not seeing Governor Jiang, they headed towards the hostages.
1:36:37|1:36:46|Arriving at the scene, [Governor Jiang] opened fire, hitting the criminals, who then crashed through the bus window and fell down. After that, [Governor Jiang] continued to shoot down at the criminals from a high vantage point.
1:36:46|1:36:50|On the other side, [Zhang Zaishan], who was quietly approaching, suddenly got shot in the leg.
1:36:50|1:36:57|In the car, [Hong Jipeng] shouted loudly.
1:36:59|1:37:15|[Zhang Zaishan] and [Hong Jipeng] were shooting at each other from behind several cars. Seeing it was difficult to effectively suppress the enemy, [Zhang Zaishan] got into the car and stepped on the gas pedal. As the car moved forward, he continued shooting. In the congested tunnel, cars quickly collided one after another, eventually blocking [Hong Jipeng]'s car door.
1:37:15|1:37:23|Then he removed the bomb from his chest and threw it towards [Hong Jipeng]. Both of them hurriedly reversed their cars, knocking over the vehicles blocking the road.
1:37:23|1:37:30|Suddenly, [Zhang Zaishan] charged forward instead of retreating, holding the detonator as he ran towards [Hong Jipeng]. When he reached halfway, he pressed the detonator.
1:37:30|1:37:34|The explosion cleared the vehicles on the road.
1:37:34|1:37:41|[Hong Jipeng] felt played and angrily drove the car forward, firing wildly, while [Zhang Zaishan] risked his life, roaring and shooting.
1:37:41|1:37:48|Two cars came head-on towards each other, accelerating until the bullets ran out before stepping on the gas pedal bravely, resulting in a collision with the same car.
1:38:8|1:38:12|[Hong Jipeng] took out a detonator to show [Zhang Zaishan], then detonated it in front of him.
1:38:12|1:38:23|[Zhang Zaishan] was furious, stepped on the gas pedal, causing the tires to rub against the ground, creating a sudden burst of smoke. In this way, two cars squeezed the middle car, and the middle car, under uneven force, began to spin.
1:38:23|1:38:34|Until three cars were lined up side by side, [Zhang Zaishan] smashed [Hong Jipeng]'s rearview mirror first, only to find out in astonishment that the bullets had run out. As he was changing the magazine inside the car, [Hong Jipeng] reached out through the window.
1:38:34|1:38:39|Climbing onto the middle of the car, [Zhang Zaishan] wanted to make a move, but found the smoke too thick, blocking his view.
1:38:39|1:38:44|As he sat up and leaned closer, [Hong Jipeng] had already pointed the submachine gun out of the car window at his forehead.
1:38:44|1:38:52|Suddenly a car crashed into the rear of [Hong Jipeng]'s car at high speed, causing his car to be thrown out on the spot, and his arm holding the gun was crushed as a result.
1:39:14|1:39:21|[Hong Jipeng] was pressed on the roof of the car by the armed police, but he let out a twisted laugh. His younger brother [Hong Jibiao] lay on a stretcher, shot multiple times and became a casualty of the battle.
1:39:36|1:39:50|In the long tunnel, he is the figure going against the flow, passing through the crowded people. This time, without any assistance, he goes alone, hoping to snatch back a few more lives from the hands of death. A shot in the calf makes him run stumbling, while the hostages run towards the nearest exit door, no longer in a panic.
1:40:3|1:40:11|Police officers maintained order, pointed the way, endured nearly 72 hours of hardship, and when they stepped out of the tunnel, the world in each person's heart lit up.
1:40:11|1:40:19|[A Bin] came to the front of the truck, pushed open the door, jumped onto the carriage, and turned on a flashlight to discover that the carriage was filled with explosives and detonators.
1:40:30|1:40:32|In the carriage, [A Bin] opens the floor.
1:40:32|1:40:40|What came into view was a dense tangle of fuses, with clusters of fuses twisted and intertwined together, speculated [A Bin].
1:40:40|1:40:48|After speaking, he quickly jumped off the train carriage.
1:40:50|1:40:54|Under the car, [A Bin] turns on a flashlight, pries open the iron cover, and advises his colleague beside him.
1:41:8|1:41:16|He crouched down, supporting his legs, and pounced towards the truck. The wound on his calf was bleeding profusely, but he paid no attention to it. He pushed open the truck door, losing too much blood, which left him physically exhausted.
1:41:17|1:41:25|He almost rolled and crawled into the carriage. When he struggled to stand up holding onto the cardboard box, he realized something was missing.
1:42:14|1:42:18|Outside the tunnel, people dare not linger and quickly run away.
1:42:18|1:42:26|After a thorough search, Zhang Zaishan found the detonator. Gently moving aside the casing, the countdown time of the detonator caught his eye, with only 3 minutes and over 50 seconds remaining.
1:42:26|1:42:31|Tick-tock, time passed by as Zhang Zaishan came up with a plan.
1:43:5|1:43:13|A few words seemed to exhaust all his strength, outside the tunnel.
1:43:24|1:43:30|[Zhang Zaishan] stared with his handsome eyes. He paused and said.
1:43:40|1:43:47|Taking a deep breath, [Zhang Zaishan] clenched his teeth and said these words.
1:43:47|1:43:53|He gasped for breath as the motor oil dripped down onto his cheeks.
1:43:53|1:43:58|The timer has only over two minutes left, with only two wires connected to it.
1:43:58|1:44:4|Outside the tunnel, fire trucks, police cars, and command vehicles all sounded their alarms to evacuate the scene urgently.
1:44:4|1:44:12|The alarm sounds one after another, and the last few police cars also leave one after another. With a grimy face, [Zhang Zaishan] presses the walkie-talkie.
1:44:50|1:44:57|Long-time partner [A Bin] knows the outcome well.
1:44:59|1:45:1|He could only grit his teeth and give a positive answer.
1:45:1|1:45:4|[Zhang Zaishan] gently pushed aside the red string with his hand.
1:45:4|1:45:8|The left fingertip touches the yellow line, while the right hand slowly approaches with the pliers held.
1:45:8|1:45:15|His dirty right hand was wrapped in sweat, blood, and engine oil, with the most eye-catching being a scar printed on the back of his hand.
1:45:15|1:45:38|The engine oil slid from the cheek to the ear, [Zhang Zaishan] closed his eyes again. Also tonight, [Jia Wen] sat at the head of the bed in the bedroom. Suddenly she thought of something, picked up the phone on the bedside table, unlocked it, and looked at the text message on the phone. It was the same message as last time, "Be happy, you can do it." At this moment, [Zhang Zaishan] picked up the walkie-talkie again and said.
1:45:41|1:45:55|[A Bin] is under the car wearing a helmet, sweating profusely, frowning, waiting for news.
1:45:56|1:46:11|[Zhang Zaishan] clenched his right hand to cut the yellow wire. In the bedroom, [Jia Wen] looked at the text message and smiled. She noticed a large blank space in the message, then continued to scroll down boredly. Suddenly, three words stopped in front of her eyes: I love you.
1:47:13|1:47:19|With sobs, her shoulders heaving, she repeatedly slid her fingertips down, tears streaming down her face.
1:47:19|1:47:29|The sentence she had been waiting for, [Zhang Zaishan] had already said. She repeatedly looked through the text messages, tears streaming down her face. The last sentence of the message was, "I said it."
1:47:30|1:47:40|The time froze at 3:11 in the afternoon, and everything seemed too late. If I could have seen it earlier, understood his intentions sooner, that would have been satisfying.
1:47:40|1:47:51|[Jia Wen], with red eyes, tried hard to control her emotions. Tears fell instinctively. At the scene of the underwater tunnel, most of the police cars and fire trucks that retreated in time were unharmed.
1:47:51|1:48:1|At the entrance of the tunnel, smoke and dust filled the air, creating a desolate scene. The officers pushed [A Bin] on a stretcher to the ambulance, and together they lifted him onto it.
1:48:1|1:48:10|The policewoman sitting on the roadside was sobbing with [Governor Jiang].
1:48:30|1:48:37|Sadness filled the hearts of every police officer. The Hong Kong cemetery. The coffins of the officers were neatly arranged next to a deep pit.
1:48:37|1:48:46|The music of sorrow and joy plays, all the police officers stand on the lawn, their expressions solemn, all dressed in formal attire. In the front three rows, the family members hold the deceased's photos in their hands against their chests.
1:48:46|1:48:55|[Jia Wen] stood in the center, holding a photo of [Zhang Zaishan]. In the photo, he appeared serious and did not smile, exuding a dignified and handsome charm.
1:48:55|1:49:2|Amidst sorrow and joy, everyone present bowed their heads in a moment of silence.
