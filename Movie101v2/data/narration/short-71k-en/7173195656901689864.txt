0:0:26|0:0:38|A Western-style wedding scene unfolds before us, with the bride slowly walking towards the stage under the gaze of the crowd. Behind her, flower girls continuously scatter petals into the air, while the bride's face is filled with a happy smile.
0:0:38|0:0:52|Before long, she came to the stage, where the groom took a few steps forward to lead the bride up. Then, the bride turned to stand side by side with the groom, and the guests below burst into applause. At this moment, the emcee on stage spoke.
0:2:12|0:2:27|The screen gradually shows several butterflies, and soon the butterflies fly away slowly, revealing the title of the film "Love Across Nine Lifetimes". Then the scene shifts, a city gradually emerges in front of the eyes, with tall buildings neatly arranged in the city, and the scene slowly stops in front of a building.

0:5:13|0:5:23|Speak. Walking down the company corridor, [Cao Aiai] suddenly stopped in her tracks and looked across, only to see [Yan Lang] slowly approaching. [Cao Aiai] then hugged the files to her chest, lowered her head, and walked forward slowly.
0:5:24|0:5:32|In a moment of passing by, [Cao Aiai] suddenly turned around and fell down. [Yan Lang] on the side caught her, only to see her eyes closed slightly and her lips pouted.
0:5:32|0:5:37|At this moment, [Cao Aiai] saw a mental image of [Yan Lang] with his eyes closed, slowly approaching her.
0:5:37|0:5:41|Suddenly, she opened her eyes wide and quickly got up to stand straight.
0:5:41|0:5:44|Yan Lang then turned around and picked up the file on the ground to hand it to her.
0:6:6|0:6:8|After speaking, Yan Lang turned around and left.
0:6:8|0:6:12|[Cao Aiai] watched Yan Lang's back, tapping her forehead in frustration before turning and walking away.
0:6:12|0:6:17|The scene then shifts to a coffee shop, followed by a photo of a man appearing.
0:6:17|0:6:22|[Cao Aiai] was seen carefully examining a photo at this moment, occasionally glancing across the room.
0:10:8|0:10:10|[Cao Aiai] immediately spoke in English.
0:10:12|0:10:16|The other person sighed and turned around, taking out something to hand to him.
0:10:16|0:10:21|He took the item and saw the three words "Speak English" written on the ID card in his hand.
0:12:6|0:12:19|[Cao Aiai] finished speaking and quickly ran out of the coffee shop. Meanwhile, [Zhan Shaoang] slowly appeared on the elevator, pulling a suitcase as he descended. He then walked away briskly and soon arrived on the street.
0:12:35|0:12:39|[Zhan Shaoang] immediately reached for his pocket.
0:12:39|0:12:41|[Zhan Shaoang] immediately turned around and chased after the monk.
0:12:41|0:12:48|Before long, he stopped slowly by the roadside, looking around but not seeing the monk. Then he angrily slammed the suitcase down.
0:14:31|0:14:46|The scene then shifts to a meeting room, as the camera continues to push in, the faces of Cao Aiai and Hu Jingjing appear, both with a blue expression, looking at the man in front of them.
0:14:46|0:14:55|[Hu Jingjing] quickly gestured with her hands, and the man in front of her stood up and left. Another man immediately sat down, and then the scene continued to repeat in this way.
0:15:4|0:15:8|The scene then shifts, showing the two of them walking slowly down the street.
0:16:7|0:16:11|On the other side, [Zhan Shaoang] was walking on the road, raising his hand to check the time on his watch.
0:16:23|0:16:26|On the other side, [Zhan Shaoang] was still walking on the street at this time.
0:16:26|0:16:31|He walked while looking around, then suddenly stopped and looked ahead.
0:16:31|0:16:38|The scene cuts to a candle shop, where [Zhan Shaoang] looks down at himself, then raises his arm, revealing his watch.
0:16:38|0:16:43|He looked down at his watch, then glanced up ahead from time to time, before walking forward.
0:16:59|0:17:4|Accompanied by the screams of the two, the car quickly drove past, leaving only a suitcase by the roadside.
0:17:4|0:17:7|The scene shifts, and a heart monitor slowly appears.
0:17:7|0:17:15|Shortly after, [Zhan Shaoang] lay in bed wearing hospital clothes, with [Cao Aiai] and [Hu Jingjing] standing beside the bed.
0:17:52|0:17:59|[Zhan Shaoang] was lying on the hospital bed at this moment, pressing his temple with his hand, then closing his eyes with a furrowed brow.
0:17:59|0:18:2|[Wu Jinkin] saw the situation and pulled [Cao Aiai] aside, speaking up.
0:19:6|0:19:14|[Zhan Shaoang] on the bed still frowning with his temples.
0:19:18|0:19:21|[Hu Jingjing] then looked towards the sickbed and turned back to speak.
0:19:24|0:19:34|The scene then cuts to [Cao Aiai], who is seen walking into the corridor and stopping in front of a door, with [Zhan Shaoang] also stopping and looking at her.
0:19:34|0:19:48|[Cao Aiai] finished speaking, turned to look back at [Zhan Shaoang], then jumped up, reaching out to touch the door frame. She then bent down, and soon opened the door. After glancing at [Zhan Shaoang], she walked into the room, turned on the light, and then began to speak.
0:19:48|0:19:53|After the two entered the room, [Cao Aiai] casually closed the door and changed shoes while speaking again.
0:19:54|0:20:2|[Zhan Shaoang] listened and slowly walked into the living room. As he sat down on the sofa, [Cao Aiai] behind him suddenly bent over and picked up the clothes on the sofa.
0:20:2|0:20:7|[Zhan Shaoang] glanced at the sofa, then got up slightly, and only then did [Cao Aiai] take off her clothes.
0:20:7|0:20:16|The two were in an awkward situation, with a piece of underwear on the table. [Cao Aiai] picked up the underwear on the table and hurriedly ran away.
0:20:16|0:20:18|Not long after, he walked out again.
0:20:52|0:20:54|[Zhan Shaoang] slowly spoke after listening.
0:21:12|0:21:19|[Cao Aiai] immediately lowered her head, took out a piece of paper from her bag, stood up, looked at the paper in her hand, and spoke.
0:21:30|0:21:38|[Cao Aiai] rolled her eyes and then placed her hands on her hips, saying.
0:22:6|0:22:8|[Zhan Shaoang] nodded at this moment.
0:22:51|0:23:6|[Cao Aiai] finished speaking, looked at the back of [Zhan Shaoang], then turned slowly. She walked quickly to the sofa and sat down, the atmosphere heavy. The scene then shifted to a plane flying in the air. As the camera zoomed in, the face of [Zhan Shaoang]'s father appeared in front of the plane window.
0:23:43|0:23:54|Then the scene shifts, [Cao Aiai] is sitting at the table looking at the computer. At this moment, [Zhan Shaoang] walks out wrapped in a bathrobe, with his upper body bare, drying his hair as he walks.
0:24:39|0:24:44|[Cao Aiai] walked to the table, threw the bathrobe on it, and then sat down angrily to look at the computer.
0:24:44|0:24:47|Before long, [Zhan Shaoang] was seen wrapping himself in a blanket.
0:25:34|0:25:42|The scene then shifts, with the moon in the sky big and round again. Inside the house, [Cao Aiai] is now sleeping on the sofa, tossing and turning.
0:25:42|0:25:52|Before long, she suddenly sat up, then slowly got up from the sofa. She staggered past the potted plants in the living room, turned and walked towards the bathroom door.
0:25:52|0:25:56|Then he pushed open the door and walked in, casually closing the door behind him.
0:25:56|0:26:4|After a while, he pushed open the door and walked out, then closed the door, slowly turned around to face the other side, and then opened the door and walked in.
0:26:4|0:26:11|He walked slowly to the bedside, then lay down, with Zhan Shaoang sleeping soundly beside him.
0:26:11|0:26:17|The scene fades to black, and when it lights up again, we see [Cao Aiai] lying on [Zhan Shaoang]'s chest.
0:26:17|0:26:21|He relaxed his photography, then slowly opened his eyes and looked up at [Zhan Shaoang] beside him.
0:30:26|0:30:41|Lazy Pig, I'm in a good mood today. I made breakfast in the kitchen, you have to finish it all. [Zhan Shaoang] is sitting on the sofa at this moment, contentedly enjoying his breakfast.
0:30:41|0:30:49|The scene shifts to the Jersey Era Company, where [Cao Aiai] is sitting at her desk working, when suddenly [Pei Lengcui] strides over with an imposing manner.

0:33:49|0:33:58|After speaking, [Zhan Shaoang] picked up the cloth on the ground and bent down to wipe the floor. The scene then shifted to the pool, where [Hu Jingjing] and [Cao Aiai] were slowly swimming towards the edge of the pool.
0:38:15|0:38:27|[Cao Aiai] was leaning against the table at this moment, with a pensive look in his eyes, followed by a smile. He then turned around, walked slowly to [Zhan Shaoang]'s side, and spoke.
0:39:37|0:39:44|[Cao Aiai] turned angrily to the side and spoke.
0:43:41|0:43:45|The scene then cuts to two people sitting on a bench in front of a fountain.
0:44:24|0:44:35|Zhan Shaoang looked at [Cao Aiai] beside him, then smiled and lowered his head. The scene then shifted to a villa, where a person was seen walking inside.
0:46:2|0:46:9|This property was launched in the context of tightening regulations in the national real estate market and increasing competition within the industry.
0:46:56|0:47:2|[Cao Aiai] watched as the two of them walked away, then she squatted down to pick up the cup on the ground, looking at it with frustration.
0:47:3|0:47:19|Shortly after, she left the meeting room looking aggrieved. In the blink of an eye, it was nighttime. [Cao Aiai] was seen sitting at the table in her home, focused on the computer screen. As the clock struck midnight, the scene faded away, revealing a pair of hands typing on the keyboard.
0:47:33|0:47:45|Walking to [Cao Aiai]'s workstation, he glanced around, then sat down on [Cao Aiai]'s chair when he saw no one around. He plugged the USB drive into the computer and smirked mischievously.
0:47:49|0:47:53|[Cao Aiai] sat down immediately, but didn't sit steadily and almost fell down.
0:47:53|0:47:57|Then she shifted her body, sat down, and casually adjusted her bangs.
0:48:39|0:48:50|[Cao Aiai] then slowly got up and left. She returned to her desk, threw the documents on the table, and rested her head on her hand in frustration, before casually flipping through the papers in front of her.
0:49:15|0:49:22|[Cao Aiai] angrily looked around, then sat down in frustration, resting her head on the table.
0:49:22|0:49:34|The scene changes, the clock on the wall shows it's twelve o'clock. [Cao Aiai] is sitting on a chair in front of the table, with her legs propped up on the table, yawning slowly, then looking at the computer. [Zhan Shaoang] then walks out slowly.
0:49:34|0:49:39|She placed the cup in her hand on the table and walked behind [Cao Aiai], speaking.
0:51:22|0:51:34|[Cao Aiai] listened thoughtfully, looked at [Zhan Shaoang] and nodded, then clapped her hands. The scene shifted to a meeting room, where [Yan Lang] turned around and walked to the conference table, speaking.
0:52:49|0:52:53|The scene then shifts, showing two people on the treadmill in the gym.
0:53:9|0:53:13|[Cao Aiai] listened, turned her head and thought for a moment, then slowly spoke.
0:53:23|0:53:32|The scene fades away, then cuts to [Cao Aiai]'s home.
0:53:32|0:53:36|[Zhan Shaoang] finished speaking and then turned his head to the side, remaining silent.
0:53:36|0:53:38|[Cao Aiai] said again at this moment.
0:54:55|0:55:0|[Cao Aiai] looked at the silent [Zhan Shaoang], then turned her head and slowly spoke.
0:55:6|0:55:16|In a precise shot, we see [Zhan Shaoang] wearing a suit and glasses, appearing on the screen. Behind him, not far away, are two spotlights set up, and next to him is a reflector board.
0:55:16|0:55:23|[Zhan Shaoang] looked up ahead, and soon he changed into a different dress, wearing a wig, standing helplessly with his head tilted back.
0:55:23|0:55:27|Later, she changed into another floral dress, holding a cigarette, standing with her hands on her hips.
0:55:27|0:55:33|His head was adorned with permed curls, with a mole at the corner of his mouth, giving him a sinister appearance.
0:55:33|0:55:38|He kept changing his movements, while [Hu Jingjing] on the side kept giving him instructions back and forth.
0:55:38|0:55:44|[Cao Aiai] was laughing uncontrollably on the side at this moment, and then the scene cut to a meeting room when the screen lit up again.
0:57:5|0:57:10|At this moment, the scene shifts to [Su Man] walking in the airport lobby with a suitcase.
0:57:10|0:57:24|She looked around and soon left slowly through the door.
0:57:24|0:57:27|Zhang Jie then took the things and handed them to the two children, and one of the children said.
0:57:47|0:57:51|After seeing this on Weibo, [Cao Aiai] sends us money every month.
0:57:58|0:58:7|The scene shifts, and we see [Su Man] sitting face to face with someone, then she starts speaking.
0:58:7|0:58:18|[Su Man] listened and then immediately placed a check on the table. The man glanced at the check, and then his pipe fell to the ground from his mouth.
0:58:18|0:58:21|At the same time, [Cao Aiai] pushed the door open and returned home.
1:0:49|1:1:2|Accompanied by the sound of a camera, a person is seen taking out a photo and placing it on the table. The camera then slowly moves, while [Su Man] picks up the photo and looks through it one by one. She then furrows her brows, sets down the photo, and slowly begins to speak.
1:1:12|1:1:23|With a determined look in his eyes, the scene then shifts to inside the Jersey Era Company, where [Yan Lang] is slowly walking. He stops at [Cao Aiai]'s workstation and speaks.
1:2:7|1:2:16|Shortly after, [Cao Aiai] hung up the phone, smiled and looked ahead. She then adjusted her bag, tidied her hair, and turned around with a smile before leaving.
1:2:16|1:2:27|The scene then fades to [Zhan Shaoang], who slowly appears sitting on the sofa, staring blankly ahead. She scratches her head, looks down at her watch, then picks up the clothes on the sofa and stands up to leave.
1:2:29|1:2:34|At this moment, a figure flashed outside the restaurant, and [Cao Aiai] turned her head to look out the window.
1:2:34|1:2:39|[Cao Aiai] turned around slowly, as if lost in thought, and then looked at [Yan Lang] before speaking.
1:4:33|1:4:39|[Yan Lang] picked up the water glass on the table at this moment and took a sip, then spoke slowly.
1:4:51|1:4:55|[Yan Lang] then turned and left, while [Cao Aiai] slowly sat down.
1:5:23|1:5:29|In the distance, a person carrying a bag slowly approaches.
1:5:29|1:5:36|This person is [Su Man], after speaking, she sat on the stool, and [Cao Aiai] turned to look at her and said.
1:5:36|1:5:42|On the other side, [Yan Lang] is washing her hands in the bathroom. At this moment, someone walks up to her, and that person is [Zhan Shaoang].
1:6:3|1:6:4|[Cao Aiai] is such a good girl.
1:6:11|1:6:14|The house is a mess, like a garbage dump. As soon as she starts cleaning, she runs to the bathroom.
1:6:31|1:6:34|He is lazy and loves to eat snacks endlessly.
1:7:24|1:7:30|[Cao Aiai] listened, then turned to look around, lowered her head in thought for a moment, and then spoke to [Su Man].
1:8:46|1:8:52|[Cao Aiai] finished speaking, then picked up her bag and left quickly, leaving [Su Man] alone sitting at the table.
1:8:52|1:8:57|Before long, [Yan Lang] walked over and saw [Su Man], then slowly spoke.
1:8:57|1:9:2|Su Man did not reply to him. At this moment, Cao Aiai suddenly walked back quickly.
1:9:2|1:9:7|She picked up her phone, then raised a glass, and [Yan Lang] was splashed with wine.
1:9:9|1:9:19|At this moment, [Zhan Shaoang] slowly walked over.
1:9:19|1:9:25|[Zhan Shaoang] finished speaking, then he pulled [Su Man] by the arm, while [Su Man] slowly picked up her bag and stood up.
1:9:25|1:9:29|Shortly after, the two of them turned and left, leaving [Yan Lang] standing in place.
1:10:8|1:10:15|Then, the scene shifts to the street, with [Su Man] finishing her sentence, [Zhan Shaoang] turns around to look at [Su Man] and takes the photo from her hand.
1:11:0|1:11:5|Then the scene shifts, and [Zhan Shaoang] is seen entering through the door.
1:11:6|1:11:11|Then she walked to the living room and then went to the window to look at [Cao Aiai].
1:13:22|1:13:27|Then the scene shifts, showing [Yan Lang] walking in the company with two police officers following behind him.
1:13:27|1:13:34|Before long, the three of them arrived at the workstation of [Cao Aiai]. At that moment, [Cao Aiai], who was working, turned her head and looked at the three of them with a puzzled expression.
1:13:55|1:14:2|And the relevant documents were found in the recycle bin on your computer.
1:14:48|1:14:52|At the same time, [Zhan Shaoang] paces back and forth at home with a heavy heart.
1:14:52|1:14:58|Not long after, he stopped in his tracks, turned around, picked up the phone on the table, and then placed it next to his ear.
1:14:58|1:15:1|At this moment, his brow furrowed, his eyes wandering and unfocused.
1:15:1|1:15:7|Before long, he took the phone away from his ear again and looked down at it.
1:15:28|1:15:35|[Zhan Shaoang] hung up the phone immediately, and then the scene shifted to a tall building, followed by the appearance of [Zhan Shaoang]'s father in the frame.
1:16:42|1:16:45|[Zhan Shaoang] is holding [Su Man]'s arms and walking in, speaking slowly.
1:16:51|1:16:53|After Su Man finished speaking, she slowly sat down on the sofa.
1:16:57|1:16:59|Su Man immediately turned around and spoke.
1:18:49|1:18:50|This is the villain [Pei Lengcui].
1:18:54|1:18:55|This led to his bankruptcy in the stock market.
1:19:1|1:19:2|The police are currently searching for him.
1:19:54|1:20:0|[Zhan Shaoang] smiled and looked at [Cao Aiai], who suddenly approached him and spoke.
1:20:8|1:20:14|Pei Lengcui drove the vehicle with deep affection and seriousness, frequently looking back, while the police car behind was in hot pursuit.
1:20:43|1:20:46|[Cao Aiai] finished speaking and then turned and ran away, while [Zhan Shaoang] continued speaking.
1:20:52|1:20:57|On the other side, the police car is still chasing Pei Lengcui.
1:20:57|1:21:7|[Zhan Shaoang] immediately pushed [Cao Aiai] aside, but he was hit and thrown by a car. Inside the car, [Pei Lengcui] looked out in horror, while [Cao Aiai] sat on the ground with a blank expression.
1:21:30|1:21:47|[Cao Aiai], ignoring the calls from [Hu Jingjing] behind her, kept running forward. The scene shifted, showing her hurriedly entering the Postal Savings Bank, then quickly coming out of the Bank of China, and rushing into the Agricultural Bank. Her hurried figure shuttled back and forth between the banks, constantly inserting her bank card into the ATM.
1:21:47|1:21:56|Entering the password on the keypad, she then took out the cash. As she walked, she took out her phone, walked to the outside of the bank, placed the phone to her ear, and started talking.
1:25:1|1:25:6|The scene cuts to [Zhan Shaoang], with bandages wrapped around his head, lying on a hospital bed, slowly opening his eyes.
1:25:8|1:25:12|[Zhan Shaoang] then turned his head to the side and spoke.
1:25:12|1:25:15|Then the scene shifts to a villa.
1:25:15|1:25:16|Su Man pushed Zhan Shaoang out at this moment.
1:25:28|1:25:32|At this moment, [Zhan Shaoang] in the wheelchair suddenly spoke slowly.
1:25:32|1:25:37|[Su Man] immediately stepped forward and squatted down, placing her hand on [Zhan Shaoang]'s hand, looking at him as she spoke.
1:25:38|1:25:47|[Zhan Shaoang] listened, then slowly released [Su Man]'s hand, turned to the side without speaking, and then the scene shifted, only to see a film playing on the screen inside the room.
1:25:47|1:25:49|[Zhan Shaoang] is sitting on the sofa eating potato chips at the moment.
1:26:11|1:26:24|Then he picked up a potato chip and handed it to [Su Man]. The scene then shifted to a pool, where a person in front of the pool slowly picked up a toothbrush and put it in their mouth. This person was none other than [Zhan Shaoang], who suddenly stopped his actions while looking at the words in the mirror.
1:26:26|1:26:33|[Zhan Shaoang] at this moment slowly lowered his head, gazing at the faucet as if lost in thought, then looked up at the mirror and spoke slowly.
1:26:34|1:26:41|The scene shifts to a man and a woman sitting at a table, with shelves full of liquor bottles in front of them.
1:27:6|1:27:10|At this moment, a person slowly walked over and sat down next to [Zhan Shaoang].
1:27:31|1:27:37|On the other side, [Zhan Shaoang] was sitting in a chair looking at the computer, when someone walked up to him and spoke.
1:27:46|1:27:54|[Zhan Shaoang] then sat up and looked at the computer. On the screen was a photo with the words "Zhan Shaoang" written on it, and the person in the photo was himself.
1:27:54|1:28:5|[Zhan Shaoang] immediately frowned, flipped through several pages backwards, until he came across a photo of [Cao Aiai] on the computer screen, where he stopped. Below the photo were the words "the planner of this advertising project."
1:28:5|1:28:8|The scene then shifts, showing [Cao Aiai] sitting in a chair in the office.
1:28:14|1:28:17|[Cao Aiai] immediately picked up the phone on the table.
1:28:24|1:28:29|The scene shifts to a movie theater, where [Cao Aiai] and [Hu Jingjing] are seen walking in slowly.
1:28:52|1:28:59|[Cao Aiai] then looked around, and suddenly the lights around her went out.
1:29:4|1:29:10|Then, the screen in the middle suddenly lit up, and a silhouette of a man in a suit gradually appeared on the screen.
1:29:10|1:29:16|[Cao Aiai] was attracted by the lit-up screen, turned around slowly to look ahead, and soon, voices could be heard around her.
1:29:36|1:30:3|At this moment, [Cao Aiai] in the seat had tears in her eyes, staring blankly at the screen in front of her. The screen gradually zoomed in, showing [Zhan Shaoang] arriving at the entrance of the hospital outpatient building. He slowly looked up at the building, then walked into the hospital and entered the outpatient hall. He gradually slowed down his pace, looking around the surroundings.
1:30:3|1:30:5|The screen fades to a still image.
1:30:5|1:30:11|Later, [Zhan Shaoang] arrived at the hospital corridor, holding something in his hand, and asked the nurse nearby.
1:30:11|1:30:17|The nurse shook her head after looking and then pushed the cart away, leaving only [Zhan Shaoang] standing in place.
1:30:17|1:30:27|In the next scene, [Zhan Shaoang] walks onto the street, looking down as he slowly moves forward. Then he looks around and sees the figures of himself and [Cao Aiai] beside him.
1:30:28|1:30:38|Not long after, the two figures disappeared again, while [Zhan Shaoang] stood on the street, his eyes wandering, looking around in confusion.
1:30:38|1:30:45|Before long, [Zhan Shaoang] arrived at another corridor. He slowly approached the door, but in his mind, he could only see the image of [Cao Aiai] jumping up to grab the keys.
1:30:46|1:30:49|He then reached out and picked up the key on the door frame.
