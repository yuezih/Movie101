0:1:45|0:1:50|The [Hei Yu] tribe lives in the city of Tian Du.
0:2:18|0:2:25|In the city of Tiandu, the young [Ni Kongkong] is hiding in a narrow cave, using a fence to block the entrance, nervously looking out.
0:2:42|0:2:47|An older child, a few years older than the others, shooed everyone away and spoke to [Ni Kongkong].
0:3:9|0:3:17|[Ni Kongkong] slowly moved away from the fence, looking timidly at the unfamiliar big child in front of the cave.
0:3:17|0:3:21|The older child managed to trick [Ni Kongkong] out.
0:3:21|0:3:26|At this moment, a child unexpectedly pulled out a dagger and slid it towards the glowing palm of [Ni Kongkong].
0:3:29|0:3:40|One afternoon many years later, the adult Ni Kongkong sat on the eaves of Tian Du City, looking at the still glowing palm of his hand, reminiscing about the painful memories of his childhood.
0:3:40|0:3:47|At this moment, his pet Ouka hopped around him, gesturing excitedly. [Ni Kongkong] glanced over and said helplessly.
0:3:57|0:4:3|[Ni Kongkong] said, then with Ou Ka, leaped off the roof and arrived at the busiest street in Tiandu City.
0:4:3|0:4:13|The wide street was crowded with people coming and going, and the merchants along the street were doing brisk business. Traders who had heard of it wandered between the various shops.
0:4:55|0:5:4|At this moment, [Ni Kongkong] threw a piece of gold to him.
0:5:4|0:5:8|As soon as the boss turned around, [Ni Kongkong] deftly stole the gold back.
0:5:26|0:5:33|[Ni Kongkong] instantly recalled his son's ordeal, pulled out a dagger, and stabbed the burly man to the ground.
0:5:33|0:5:37|Upon standing up, he found himself surrounded by several thugs wielding machetes.
0:5:37|0:5:45|In the jianghu for many years, [Ni Kongkong] remained calm and composed. He threw an iron chain to the ground, and Ouka immediately grabbed the chain, curling up into a ball.
0:5:46|0:5:49|[Ni Kongkong] actually scattered a few people from the Ouka.
0:5:49|0:5:56|The hard-shelled Ni Kongkong is not suitable for any weapon, like a hammer mercilessly knocking down several people to the ground.
0:5:59|0:6:2|[Ni Kongkong] saw the situation was not good, so he released a mist bomb and prepared to escape.
0:6:2|0:6:7|Ni Kongkong was still blocked by the King in the sky.
0:6:7|0:6:12|After tying up [Ni Kongkong], the thug's boss walked up to him with the fake goods in hand.
0:6:50|0:6:55|Ni Kongkong had no choice but to take a risk.
0:7:19|0:7:27|When night fell, [Ni Kongkong] used lightness skills to arrive on the rooftop of the Prince's mansion, searching for the right moment.
0:7:40|0:7:48|At this moment, the Prince's Mansion was already filled with ice sculptures, and the courtyard was full of rare treasures beyond count. Even top-grade jade and agate were nothing special here.
0:7:48|0:7:51|At this moment, the chief steward in the mansion shouted to everyone,
0:8:31|0:8:40|The prince stepped down and saw a seahorse emitting a strange light in the crystal stone, with a head resembling a dragon's head and two pairs of wings behind it.
0:8:40|0:8:46|Although the city of Tian Du is full of rare treasures, there is no second one like this in the world.
0:8:46|0:8:56|While the Prince was still basking in the admiring gazes of the crowd, completely unaware, [Ni Kongkong] and Ou Ka had already stealthily arrived at the underground palace in the Prince's mansion where treasures were stored.
0:8:57|0:9:1|Ni Kongkong looked at the countless treasures in front of her, her heart blooming with joy.
0:9:1|0:9:6|But upon hearing the footsteps of the guards patrolling, he quickly hid Ou Ka in the rafters.
0:9:6|0:9:9|But the guard with a keen sense of smell still sensed something unusual.
0:9:14|0:9:19|The guard thought he had misheard and didn't pay attention, then turned around to leave.
0:9:19|0:9:25|Unexpectedly, as soon as he turned around, he was pierced in the head by the assassin [Hei Yu] with a dagger resembling a bat's face.
0:9:25|0:9:32|Immediately, the more terrifying [Lei Bao] wielded a huge iron axe and split the surrounding guards in half one by one.
0:9:32|0:9:36|But as soon as they stepped into the entrance of the underground palace, they were instantly dealt with by the powerful [Feng Xiao].
0:9:44|0:9:50|The dying guard lunged at [Feng Xiao] while [He Ying] simultaneously threw a dart towards him.
0:10:45|0:10:50|The smell of Eurcoffee's fart gradually spread from the rafters to below.
0:11:0|0:11:4|At this moment, the lanterns in the Prince's Mansion were mysteriously blown out by the wind.
0:11:4|0:11:6|[He Ying] saw the situation and smiled charmingly.
0:11:12|0:11:15|[Ni Kongkong] followed the group out after seeing them leave.
0:11:15|0:11:17|The queen at noon spoke to [Prince].
0:11:19|0:11:22|[Prince] continues to introduce while holding the Eye of the Sky.
0:11:42|0:11:52|The master of the language family [Xue Lie] had just finished speaking when he suddenly appeared in front of the [Prince]. At this moment, the three of [Feng Xiao] also arrived in time, and the playful [Prince] chuckled at the scene.
0:12:1|0:12:6|[Xue Lie] sneered coldly, then suddenly extended six damaged bones from his back.
0:12:6|0:12:12|Soon after, [Hei Yu] also began to transform from his bones, revealing a pair of incredibly large wings in front of everyone.
0:12:12|0:12:17|Unexpectedly, [Xue Lie] is using the shoulder bone on his wings to stab the guests in the abdomen.
0:12:17|0:12:22|In an instant, the guests desperately scattered and fled, but the ruthless [Xue Lie] stabbed each of them to death.
0:12:23|0:12:31|At this moment, [Prince] crawled on the ground with the treasure in hand, ready to escape. Unexpectedly, [Xue Lie] suddenly swung and threw the queen's body in front of him.
0:12:31|0:12:36|[Prince] Although cynical, he stood up in anger as he watched his lover die in front of him.
0:12:36|0:12:44|Unfortunately, the power gap between the two was too great. [Xue Lie] pierced the [Prince]â€™s scapula with bone spurs and firmly pinned him to the wall.
0:12:44|0:12:47|[Xue Lie] reached out and took the Sky Eye from the hands of the Prince, saying.
0:13:2|0:13:8|The next morning, the general who learned of the matter hurriedly rode through the bustling streets and headed straight to the palace of the [Emperor].
0:13:8|0:13:11|The [Emperor] is seen near the palace, towering a hundred meters high.
0:13:11|0:13:14|Set against the backdrop of the mountain peaks, the momentum appears particularly extravagant.
0:13:14|0:13:21|The general entered the city, waving flags on a fast horse, walking alone through the small path, then taking a wind ladder like an elevator to finally arrive in front of the [Emperor].
0:14:15|0:14:21|[Yang Zhenhu] heard the order, listened to his subordinates, and pushed open the gates of the Prince's mansion, only to see corpses scattered everywhere.
0:14:21|0:14:24|At this moment, the henchmen noticed that [Hei Yu] was quietly following.
0:14:40|0:14:46|Facing the push from Tiger Tooth, [Fei Long] naturally didn't say a word, and with a few moves, he put his own people on the shrimp ground.
0:15:20|0:15:27|At the same time, [Ni Kongkong], who learned the news in the underground palace that day, had already arrived at the Spirit Mountain with Ou Ka ahead of time.
0:15:27|0:15:32|On this eerie mountain stands a huge stone sculpture, with a cave at its feet.
0:15:42|0:15:55|Afterwards, [Ni Kongkong] opened the stone door of the secret passage and turned the switch forcefully. A bronze mirror slowly appeared on the stone wall, reflecting the sunlight deep into the bottom of the cave.
0:15:55|0:15:59|After Okka climbed onto him, [Ni Kongkong] grabbed the rope and slowly descended towards the bottom of the cave.
0:15:59|0:16:4|Halfway down the slide, [Ni Kongkong]'s right hand with the strange crack suddenly stung.
0:16:37|0:16:42|After the interactive dust settled, a carefully excavated cave was revealed behind the stone wall.
0:16:42|0:16:47|The walls of the cave are covered with valuable fluorescent stones.
0:16:47|0:16:48|[Ni Kongkong] excitedly exclaimed with a bow and arrow.
0:16:53|0:17:0|Hei Yu took out the hook lock and hung it on the wall, then excitedly took down the fluorescent stones on the wall one by one and put them into a cloth bag.
0:17:0|0:17:4|While he was enjoying the joy of getting rich, he suddenly felt a sharp pain in his right hand.
0:17:4|0:17:9|After taking off his gloves, he found that the light shining from the cracks on his right hand was unusually dazzling.
0:17:9|0:17:16|At this moment, he didn't even care about stealing the fluorescent stone. After staring at the crack for a long time, he seemed to sense a mysterious power.
0:17:16|0:17:20|He looked up at the waterfall in front of him, then held out his palm towards the direction of the waterfall.
0:17:21|0:17:27|At this moment, a light similar to the crack in the palm also emanated from behind the waterfall.
0:17:27|0:17:35|[Ni Kongkong] saw the situation and raised his palm over his head with force. Unexpectedly, he was instantly sucked into the mysterious light behind the waterfall.
0:17:35|0:17:43|Only after passing through the waterfall did they see the mysterious light that could resonate with [Ni Kongkong]'s palm, emanating from an iron box on a column.
0:17:43|0:17:46|The closer she got to the iron box, [Ni Kongkong] could feel the mysterious power more and more.
0:17:48|0:17:53|He clenched his teeth and exerted all his strength to hold the iron box tightly in his palm in order to uncover the secret hidden in the palm.
0:17:53|0:17:59|Miraculously, the light on the iron box was absorbed by [Ni Kongkong] after coming into contact with the cracks in the palm.
0:17:59|0:18:3|But he still didn't find out the truth about the crack and the iron box.
0:18:3|0:18:12|At this moment, [Feng Xiao] arrived at the bottom of the cave with two feathered guards, while completely unaware, [Ni Kongkong] was still desperately trying to smash open the iron box with a stone.
0:18:23|0:18:31|Ni Kongkong dodged two crossbow arrows shot directly at him, as Feng Xiao walked over slowly and said.
0:18:31|0:18:34|[Ni Kongkong] is clever, placing the box on the ground and kicking it towards [Feng Xiao].
0:18:34|0:18:37|At this moment, Ouka ran to [Ni Kongkong]'s side.
0:18:57|0:19:3|[Ni Kongkong] took advantage of the enemy's confusion, quickly threw a European coffee, knocking out the guards, then grabbed a sword crossbow and shot at [Feng Xiao].
0:19:3|0:19:6|Unexpectedly, [Feng Xiao] actually rebounded the crossbow back.
0:19:6|0:19:9|At this moment, [Hei Yu] suddenly appeared and saved [Ni Kongkong].
0:19:32|0:19:40|[Ni Kongkong] suddenly launched an attack, kicking Okka towards [Feng Xiao], followed by a punch straight to the face, but such tricks were ineffective in front of [Feng Xiao].
0:19:40|0:19:43|He knocked [Ni Kongkong] down with a backhand move.
0:19:43|0:19:48|Just as [Feng Xiao] swung his sword towards [Ni Kongkong], [Hei Yu] timely blocked his attack.
0:19:48|0:19:55|Rescued [Ni Kongkong] quickly took Ou Ka to a corner, watching the siblings fight fiercely, but after a few moves, [Hei Yu] was no match for [Feng Xiao].
0:19:57|0:20:2|Just as [Feng Xiao] was about to leave with the box, Ou Ka rushed over and casually snatched the box away.
0:20:2|0:20:8|Feng Xiao, feeling helpless, forcefully flung Ou Ka to the side, and the iron box happened to land in front of Hei Yu.
0:20:24|0:20:29|Wuliang, the box instantly released the maximum energy, sending the two flying and bouncing next to [Ni Kongkong].
0:20:57|0:21:0|The Tiger Teeth scattered, forming a encirclement.
0:21:0|0:21:14|Mr. Ni Kongkong, seeing the situation, tried to run, but was blocked by [Yang Zhenhu].
0:21:32|0:21:44|At this moment, [Feng Xiao] broke free from two pursuers and fled swiftly.
0:21:44|0:21:52|As for who [Ni Kongkong] is, [Hei Yu] doesn't care. Instead, he walks up to [Ni Kongkong], reaches into his clothes and takes out an iron box, saying to [Yang Zhenhu].
0:22:5|0:22:11|Amidst the laughter of the crowd, [Hei Yu] and [Ni Kongkong] were locked in a labor vehicle by the tiger teeth and escorted back to the city.
0:22:11|0:22:14|[Yang Zhenhu] holds a high position among the common people.
0:22:14|0:22:19|The once bustling and crowded street became quiet in an instant as the troops of [Yang Zhenhu] arrived.
0:22:19|0:22:23|People retreated to the sides with great respect, bowing to the troops.
0:22:23|0:22:28|In the labor camp, [Ni Kongkong] looked at the people with a smile, and then said to [Hei Yu].
0:23:28|0:23:42|Not long after, the two were thrown into the dungeon and chained together with the same iron chain.
0:23:42|0:23:51|Yang Zhenhu and He Ying were too busy discussing and didn't notice that the key to the prison door had been stolen. The dungeon was too narrow, and the two of them were very close to each other.
0:23:51|0:23:55|Ni Kongkong looked at the familiar face of Hei Yu and said softly.
0:24:6|0:24:17|During the fight between Ni Kongkong and Hei Yu, the prince of Tian Du City, He Li, opened the door and jumped in.
0:24:34|0:24:38|The fight between Hei Yu and Ni Kongkong left Ni Kongkong in excruciating pain.
0:24:38|0:24:41|He saw the two fighting endlessly in the water, with the sea calm and peaceful.
0:25:17|0:25:19|[Ni Kongkong] looked at [He Ying]'s jade pendant and said.
0:25:57|0:26:0|Soon after, [Ni Kongkong] whispered his perfect plan to the two of them.
0:26:0|0:26:7|At the same time, deep in the mountains outside the Tian Du City, Xue Lie looked at the Eye of the Sky and said to the never-failing [Feng Xiao].
0:27:27|0:27:32|Ouka dug a small hole in the dungeon wall and stole the box, handing it to [Ni Kongkong].
0:27:32|0:27:37|[Ni Kongkong] watches [Hei Yu] getting injured and wants to stop the bleeding for him.
0:27:42|0:27:44|Knowing Ni Kongkong's intentions, Hei Yu also let go.
0:27:44|0:27:49|He just woke up and looked at the already opened iron chains, feeling somewhat incredulous.
0:27:49|0:27:55|At this moment, [Ni Kongkong] sat on the ground, took off his boots, and took out a hemostatic medicine from the boots, preparing to apply it to [Hei Yu].
0:27:55|0:28:1|As soon as he reached out, [Hei Yu] struck him again.
0:28:8|0:28:15|[Ni Kongkong] sniffed the medicine pouch, frowned, then sniffed his own boots and awkwardly chuckled.
0:28:15|0:28:22|[Hei Yu] may talk disgustingly, but the blood constantly oozing out forced him to take [Ni Kongkong]'s hemostatic medicine.
0:28:22|0:28:30|[Ni Kongkong] applied medicine and bandaged [Hei Yu]'s wound, but his curious hands opened [Hei Yu]'s clothes, revealing the puncture marks where wings were about to grow on the feathered man.
0:28:40|0:28:44|[Ni Kongkong] sat on the side and threw the empty medicine packet on the ground unhappily.
0:28:44|0:28:47|[Hei Yu] ignored him and closed his eyes to rest.
0:28:47|0:28:51|At this moment, [Ni Kongkong] turned to [Hei Yu] and asked.
0:29:16|0:29:22|The two of them locked eyes for a long time, [Hei Yu] looked at [Ni Kongkong] with a particularly determined gaze, and then said to her.
0:29:49|0:29:53|Hei Yu attacked two prisoners and stripped off their clothes, throwing them to the two men.
0:29:53|0:29:58|Hei Yu disguised himself as Huya, swaggering out of the prison with two prisoners in tow.
0:30:32|0:30:38|At this moment, Xue Lie's subordinates disguised as Tiger Fangs, escorted Lei Bao and others into the Zhenhu Office.
0:31:8|0:31:12|Just as they turned the corner into the dungeon, [Lei Bao] and his group ran into [Ni Kongkong] and her three companions head-on.
0:31:29|0:31:34|The two groups of people are getting closer, because they are all disguised, and there is some fear in their hearts.
0:31:34|0:31:39|Walking ahead, [Ni Kongkong] and [Hei Yu] were lowering their heads in a guilty manner.
0:31:39|0:31:47|[Ni Kongkong] caught a glimpse of the extremely ugly [Lei Bao] among the prisoners, triggering memories of that night at the Prince's mansion.
0:31:47|0:31:51|[Ni Kongkong] was not happy in his heart, but in order not to expose himself, he still apologized to the other party.
0:32:0|0:32:3|[Ni Kongkong] kept looking back from time to time.
0:32:13|0:32:18|[Hei Yu] saw Yang Zhenhu walking down the steps from the front and reached out to stop [Ni Kongkong].
0:32:48|0:32:54|Due to the sudden appearance of Yang Zhenhu, the three who were almost at the door were forced to turn around and choose the small path to move forward.
0:32:54|0:33:3|At the same time, the group of [Lei Bao] who infiltrated the Zhenhu Temple had turned the administrative office upside down.
0:33:16|0:33:21|The progress of Ni Kongkong, Hei Yu, and Xue Lie on the small path was also not smooth, as they encountered a large number of guards ahead.
0:33:26|0:33:30|[Hei Yu] shook his head, and [Ni Kongkong], seeing this, pondered for a moment before speaking.
0:33:54|0:33:59|[Ni Kongkong] The perfect plan turned out to be using herself to lure away the guards on the wind stairs, thus covering for the escape of the two.
0:33:59|0:34:7|The two of them saw dozens of guards chasing after [Ni Kongkong] together, so they couldn't waste the opportunity and rushed towards the wind ladder after making eye contact.
0:34:7|0:34:15|The reinforcements arrived just in time, and a guard shot off He Li's helmet with an arrow. Luckily, [Hei Yu] was quick and took care of him in a few moves.
0:34:24|0:34:30|The guard struck the alarm gong in time, and [Yang Zhenhu] also arrived at the scene.
0:34:30|0:34:39|At this moment, in the government office, hearing the gong sound, they quickly reported to [Lei Bao].
0:34:39|0:34:44|[Lei Bao] woke up and immediately took out his iron chain giant axe, looking solemnly at the gate.
0:34:44|0:34:48|The henchmen stopped flipping their staffs and each took out their weapons to wait along the formation.
0:34:51|0:35:2|The gate was pushed open by Ni Kongkong with great force, and Lei Bao, seeing only one unarmed person approaching, felt quite puzzled.
0:35:2|0:35:8|After a moment, dozens of guards rushed to the government office. When they arrived at the door, they were also startled by [Lei Bao] and his companions.
0:35:18|0:35:32|[Lei Bao] didn't hesitate to summon a giant tiger, and the iron chain also came out of the axe handle. [Ni Kongkong] swiftly leaped up and shot a flying rope from his sleeve, avoiding this deadly blow. However, the three guards behind him were not so lucky, as they were all swept away by the giant tiger.
0:35:34|0:35:38|With the active attack from [Lei Bao], the battle between the two groups has officially begun.
0:35:38|0:35:44|Suddenly, the office seemed to have turned into a battlefield, with various documents and letters in the cabinet flying everywhere.
0:35:44|0:35:49|[Lei Bao] relied on a giant axe to almost slaughter the battle-hardened warriors.
0:35:49|0:35:51|[Ni Kongkong] also joins the battle.
0:35:51|0:35:56|Just as he was fighting fiercely, the box in his arms accidentally fell from the second floor to the ground.
0:35:56|0:35:59|The crisp voice made [Lei Bao] look towards the box.
0:35:59|0:36:2|He was about to pounce on the box when [Ni Kongkong] picked it up first.
0:36:7|0:36:11|[Lei Bao] threw a huge axe, knocking [Ni Kongkong] down from the stairs.
0:36:11|0:36:14|And at this moment, [Yang Zhenhu] arrived just in time with a long-handled knife in hand.
0:36:17|0:36:21|[Yang Zhenhu] rushed forward with the guards as soon as he gave the order.
0:36:21|0:36:25|[Yang Zhenhu]'s martial arts skills are superb. The moment he joined, he turned the situation around.
0:36:25|0:36:35|Just now, the arrogant and domineering feathered man was slashed one by one by [Yang Zhenhu], while [Lei Bao] completely disregarded the lives of his subordinates, only chasing after [Ni Kongkong], trying to snatch back what was given to him.
0:36:36|0:36:41|[Ni Kongkong] was closely pursued by [Lei Bao], from the second floor to the first floor, and then from the first floor to the corridor.
0:36:41|0:36:47|[Ni Kongkong] can only rely on the hooks on his body, struggling to shuttle up and down the corridor, trying to shake off [Lei Bao].
0:36:47|0:36:53|[Yang Zhenhu] joined the battle and quickly wiped out a soldier, then headed straight for [Lei Bao].
0:36:53|0:37:0|Panting heavily, [Ni Kongkong] saw [Yang Zhenhu] approaching and immediately perked up, shedding the previous embarrassed look and provocatively staring at [Lei Bao].
0:37:0|0:37:8|[Lei Bao], true to his name, had a particularly violent temper. Seeing [Ni Kongkong] mocking him like that, he swung his axe and aimed a blow at [Ni Kongkong]'s head.
0:37:8|0:37:13|Fortunately, [Yang Zhenhu] acted in time and dragged [Ni Kongkong] aside with the hilt of the knife.
0:37:13|0:37:16|The massive axe blow also split open a crack in the stone wall.
0:37:16|0:37:20|[Yang Zhenhu] saw that [Lei Bao] had such great strength, and did not dare to underestimate him.
0:37:20|0:37:39|Taking a fighting stance, [Lei Bao] was naturally fearless, greeting whoever came with a giant axe. At that moment, the box in [Ni Kongkong]'s arms fell to the ground, catching [Lei Bao]'s eyes. Instantly losing the will to fight, he was only thinking about how to get the box in his hands, engaging in a simple exchange of moves with [Yang Zhenhu].
0:37:39|0:37:56|Possessing the desire to pick up the box, [Yang Zhenhu] seized the opportunity and kicked [Lei Bao]'s head against the wall. The box that was just within reach flew out again, but was intercepted by [Yang Zhenhu] with a knife. Unexpectedly, [Ni Kongkong] suddenly snatched the box and dashed out of the corridor. Seeing this, [Lei Bao] immediately got up to chase after, but [Yang Zhenhu] relentlessly pursued.
0:37:56|0:38:3|So, after [Lei Bao] walked out of the corridor, he turned back and chopped off the stone pillar, trapping [Yang Zhenhu] with the falling boulder.
0:38:3|0:38:9|On the other side, [Hei Yu] and the other person printed the closed guards on the ground one by one, [He Ying] stepped onto the sealed ladder and said urgently.
0:38:45|0:38:56|[Hei Yu] had just finished speaking when, suddenly, [Lei Bao]'s flying axe smashed in from the top of the ladder, firmly hooking onto it. [Lei Bao] then used an iron chain to continuously rotate the ladder downwards.
0:38:57|0:39:3|[Hei Yu] spoke, and the three of them climbed to the top of the sealed ladder. [Hei Yu] saw [Ni Kongkong] and He Li, and grabbed the ascending rope tightly.
0:39:3|0:39:9|The mutated knife cut it off, without the tether's traction, [Ou Xi] instantly walked towards [Lei Bao].
0:39:9|0:39:19|[Ou Xi] fell from high altitude, directly submerging [Lei Bao], and the three quickly arrived at the top of Zhenhu Si.
0:39:19|0:39:22|Three people slid rapidly from one high building to another using iron hooks on a zip line.
0:39:33|0:39:42|Outside the Zhenhu Temple, after seeing Ni Kongkong and the other two escaping, Hei Yu climbed down from the wall and joined the crowd in chasing after them.
0:39:42|0:39:49|At this moment, [Yang Zhenhu], who had been rescued, led the team to arrive late. He looked at the three who had already escaped and shouted angrily.
0:39:52|0:39:57|After escaping, they stole a boat from the shore and headed towards the direction of the underground cave in the night.
0:39:57|0:40:0|The next morning, the three of them had already drifted to the outskirts of the underground cave.
0:40:0|0:40:5|On the peaks here, giant monster stone sculptures are everywhere, sending shivers down one's spine.
0:42:12|0:42:17|Night fell in the blink of an eye, and the small boat carrying three people continued to move slowly in the river.
0:42:17|0:42:20|[Hei Yu] couldn't sleep, standing alone at the bow of the ship, lost in thought while looking at the necklace.
0:42:20|0:42:23|At this moment, [Ni Kongkong] walked out of the cabin and asked.
0:42:45|0:42:48|[Hei Yu] anxiously grabbed the necklace back and directly took action.
0:42:48|0:43:3|[Ni Kongkong] jumped onto the sail, without hesitation, [Hei Yu] immediately pounced on him.
0:43:3|0:43:13|During the fight, [Hei Yu] pulls off [Ni Kongkong]'s gloves, revealing the secret of his hands. Enraged and embarrassed, [Ni Kongkong] walks towards [Hei Yu].
0:43:19|0:43:29|[Ni Kongkong] first wanted to snatch back the boxing gloves, then changed his cute image from earlier, and his punches and kicks became heavier. He lifted [Hei Yu] with force and threw him onto the boat.
0:43:29|0:43:37|Helpless, [Hei Yu] was stronger than him, he was kicked in the neck and thrown out, [Ni Kongkong] angrily threw the necklace onto the boat when he got up again.
0:43:40|0:43:45|Unexpectedly, the necklace was broken, [Hei Yu], strong and instantly furious, no longer joined forces.
0:43:45|0:43:48|With a leap, Jade Horn almost kicked [Ni Kongkong] off the ship's cabin.
0:43:53|0:43:59|[Hei Yu] rushed towards the necklace, and at that moment, the necklace emitted a tremendous amount of energy, rising into the air.
0:44:4|0:44:12|The necklace, rising halfway into the air, emitted a dazzling pollen like the Milky Way from the broken part, surrounding it.
0:44:12|0:44:18|[Ni Kongkong] tightly gripped the edge of the boat with both hands, struggling to climb aboard, but [Hei Yu] paid no attention to him at all.
0:44:18|0:44:24|At that moment, the suspended star stream pollen instantly surrounded [Hei Yu] and drilled into his wing orifice.
0:44:24|0:44:28|A surge of immense energy rushed in, causing [Hei Yu] to instantly collapse on the ground.
0:44:28|0:44:33|[Ni Kongkong] saw the situation and hurried forward.
0:44:33|0:44:35|The necklace lost its power and fell on the boat.
0:44:35|0:44:43|[Ni Kongkong] turned around and picked it up, but when he turned around again, the unconscious [Hei Yu] was rising vertically into the air under the effect of star stream pollen.
0:44:43|0:44:47|[Ni Kongkong] held onto his ankle, but a powerful force sent them both flying.
0:45:1|0:45:9|[Fei Long] followed Wu Ka's gaze and saw the two of them already floating tens of meters above the ground.
0:45:20|0:45:26|As they ascended higher and higher, [Ni Kongkong] tightly wrapped her arms around [Hei Yu]'s legs, wailing continuously.
0:45:26|0:45:32|At this moment, the star stream pollen completely merged with [Hei Yu], and a pair of large wings extended from [Hei Yu]'s back.
0:45:32|0:45:35|[Ni Kongkong] was so shocked that she was speechless.
0:45:35|0:45:43|After a moment, [Hei Yu] also gradually regained consciousness. When he opened his eyes, he found himself suspended in mid-air at a height of a hundred meters, instantly panicking.
0:45:43|0:45:47|Seeing the wings behind him, he was even more puzzled.
0:45:47|0:45:54|He panicked as he tried to control his wings, but it was his first time flying and he couldn't coordinate the flapping of both wings at the same frequency in his panic.
0:45:59|0:46:15|Both of them were falling rapidly. In a moment of panic, [Ni Kongkong] found a way and struggled to slide towards [Hei Yu]. After many twists and turns, he finally managed to lie on [Hei Yu]'s back. With both hands tightly gripping [Hei Yu]'s wings, [Ni Kongkong] exerted all his strength to swing backwards, finally helping [Hei Yu] successfully spread his wings.
0:46:16|0:46:18|And he was also shaken away by the wings.
0:46:18|0:46:24|Fortunately, when falling, [Ni Kongkong] timely shot out a grappling hook, tethering himself to [Hei Yu]'s ankle.
0:46:24|0:46:29|After this move, the two have fallen from the clouds to the canyon below.
0:46:29|0:46:33|[Hei Yu], who had just gained control of his wings, was still practicing flying diligently.
0:46:34|0:46:54|Ni Kongkong was completely unaware that she was already in the midst of a hallucinatory and dangerous jungle. The jungle was extremely fantastical, filled with colorful bubbles everywhere. After passing through the jungle, Hei Yu suddenly realized that she was about to crash into the mountaintop, prompting her to fly up, but she still ended up crashing into a tree on the mountaintop. Fortunately, both of them were unharmed. After a fantastical night.
0:46:54|0:46:56|[Ni Kongkong] looks exhausted.
0:46:56|0:47:1|He set up a fire pit to rest on the side, while the newly grown wings of [Hei Yu] looked particularly spirited.
0:47:1|0:47:6|After a brief rest, they continued practicing flying in the air.
0:47:22|0:47:32|[Hei Yu] witnessed, grabbed the wine jug, took a big gulp and choked on it.
0:47:33|0:47:37|[Hei Yu] was so overwhelmed by the strong liquor that he couldn't speak for a long time.
0:47:37|0:47:40|He wiped his mouth and sat down on a rock next to [Ni Kongkong].
0:47:40|0:47:48|At this moment, [Ni Kongkong] also approached and took out the broken necklace from his pocket to hand it to [Hei Yu].
0:48:54|0:49:1|Ni Kongkong took out the box and shook it in his palm. Every time the box passed through the cracks in his palm, it would shine brightly.
0:49:59|0:50:5|[Hei Yu] hooked onto the belt of [Ni Kongkong] with a grappling hook, before he could react, he was already flying towards the cattle boat.
0:50:5|0:50:11|The next morning, [He Ying] asked [Ni Kongkong], where did those two fly off to again?
0:50:24|0:50:34|Just as [Ni Kongkong] was about to get angry, she was teased and signaled [He Ying] to be alive. A graceful figure with fluttering wings landed on the boat.
0:50:34|0:50:37|Originally, [Hei Yu] went to investigate and introduced the two of them.
0:50:44|0:50:47|Unknowingly, the small boat sailed into a mysterious cave.
0:50:47|0:50:52|The river flows through the narrow mountain cave, and the knight Ni Kongkong emerges from the cave with a strange wind.
0:50:52|0:50:58|As the group approached, they discovered a small island in the cave, where the people were living in peace and harmony, seemingly without any joy.
0:50:58|0:51:6|Simple instruments play lively music, the bonfire flickers, the beauty twists her waist, the strong men enjoy fine wine, people from all walks of life gather here.
0:51:12|0:51:14|Suddenly someone fell down the stairs.
0:51:45|0:51:48|The three of them started to act separately.
0:51:48|0:51:50|On the other side, inside the residence of [Jiang Chengzi].
0:51:54|0:51:57|[Hei Yu] took away a treasure.
0:52:8|0:52:19|At the same time, the underground casino was bustling with noise and excitement, but danger was quietly approaching.
0:52:19|0:52:22|The [Hei Yu] clan sent numerous [Fei Long] to cross the mountain caves and tunnels.
0:52:22|0:52:26|Ni Kongkong went straight to the underground cave at night.
0:52:26|0:52:30|The gamblers in the casino were cheering wildly, completely unaware of the impending threat.
0:52:37|0:52:41|The hot host of the casino announced the results of the gambling.
0:52:47|0:52:52|[Ni Kongkong], holding a glass of wine, somehow joined in as well.
0:52:52|0:52:56|[Ni Kongkong] saw the evil dragon through the stone window.
0:52:56|0:52:58|He was just teasing, but he was pulled back by someone.
0:53:1|0:53:4|After speaking, he looked up and shouted loudly.
0:53:4|0:53:7|Facing He Lu's questioning, [Hei Yu] turned around to leave.
0:53:25|0:53:34|Hei Yu kicked He Li away on the spot, He Li, unwilling to accept it, rushed up to fight back, but was kicked down again by Hei Yu. Ni Kongkong rushed over to stop He Li.
0:53:49|0:53:59|In the crowd, a beggar saw this scene, walked towards the outside, came to the corridor bridge, took out the cloth bag around his waist, and was pressed down by [Hei Yu] before he could open it.
0:53:59|0:54:8|[Hei Yu] snatched the cloth bag, and the pangolin knocked over the beggar. Then [Ni Kongkong] followed up with a stick, smashing him off the bridge.
0:54:8|0:54:11|Hei Yu walks over and steps on the beggar's chest.
0:54:11|0:54:15|[Hei Yu] leaped off the bridge and rolled up the beggar's sleeve, revealing strange tattoos inside.
0:54:23|0:54:27|Hei Yu finished speaking, stood up disdainfully.
0:54:27|0:54:29|[Ni Kongkong] walked over and separated the two confronting individuals.
0:54:31|0:54:39|Defiant [Ge Li] could only give up.
0:54:39|0:54:46|Behind the casino, there was a dark and damp dungeon with vines and rubble scattered around.
0:54:46|0:54:49|The monster's roar frightened [Hei Yu].
0:54:49|0:54:57|Three people moved forward and found that the prisoners were all chained to the hollowed-out stones.
0:54:57|0:54:58|The crowd moved forward.
0:55:2|0:55:6|[Hei Yu] hurriedly squatted down and gently patted Lao Yuan.
0:55:6|0:55:13|Lao Yuan threw a nine-grid, the smell was indescribable.
0:55:13|0:55:16|Three of them were about to open the iron chain when an accident occurred.
0:55:16|0:55:20|The soldier of Tianqian dodged the giant tiger horizontally, lifted by [Ni Kongkong].
0:55:20|0:55:26|The soldier rushed towards [Ge Li], but [Hei Yu] leaped and kicked the enemy against the wall, as [Ni Kongkong] charged forward.
0:55:31|0:55:36|Another enemy came from behind, and was subdued by a scissors kick.
0:55:36|0:55:50|The enemies preparing to ambush were knocked down by Ouka. As more enemies approached, [Fei Long] immediately picked up the sword on the ground, using the techniques "Immortal's Guidance" and "Looking Back at the Moon" to defeat the enemies. The remaining defeated soldiers took the opportunity to regroup and fight back.
0:55:50|0:55:56|In the crowd, a bald figure in a long robe with strange tattoos on his head walks forward.
0:56:1|0:56:7|The bald monster shouted and threw off his long robe, dancing with a ridiculous gait to [Hei Yu].
0:56:7|0:56:11|[Hei Yu] immediately drew his sword as [Ni Kongkong] approached.
0:56:22|0:56:23|[Ni Kongkong] gets closer and closer.
0:56:29|0:56:34|The bald man pushed Ni Kongkong again.
0:56:52|0:56:54|[Ni Kongkong] was just starting out when he was pushed away by the bald man.
0:56:56|0:56:59|The bald man turned around and walked up to [Hei Yu] with a serious expression on his face.
0:57:42|0:57:45|[Ni Kongkong] and [Hei Yu] both turned to Ge Li at the same time.
0:57:45|0:57:48|Hei Yu was stunned, spreading out her hands.
0:57:48|0:57:55|[Hei Yu] and [Ni Kongkong] nodded at each other.
0:58:2|0:58:4|Speak up, [Guangtou] and his men are leaving.
0:58:4|0:58:9|Ni Kongkong turned around and came to Hei Yu's front, shaking his head and swaying.
0:58:11|0:58:16|[Hei Yu] looked bored.
0:58:16|0:58:23|On the other side, the bald man is holding a glass of wine and a teammate, a little pig.
0:58:23|0:58:27|Speak up, he looked up as usual, but was pushed down from behind.
0:58:27|0:58:34|The bald man turned around angrily, only to see [Hei Yu] in a charming long dress.
0:59:1|0:59:7|[Hei Yu] angrily washed the dishes, causing the bald man underneath to tremble, before realizing after a while that this was his own territory.
0:59:8|0:59:17|So [Ni Kongkong] stood up, pulled up his pants, picked up the wine jug to pour wine, only to find that the jug had been emptied at some point.
0:59:17|0:59:26|[Ni Kongkong] stood up to pour wine, [Hei Yu] turned back anxiously to look at [Ni Kongkong], the two exchanged glances, but were caught by [Guangtou] on the spot.
0:59:34|0:59:44|[Ni Kongkong] was about to step forward, but was stopped by [Hei Yu] twisting his wrist.
0:59:44|0:59:49|The henchman who was about to help was shouted back by [Ni Kongkong], who then awkwardly rubbed his head and smiled at [Hei Yu].
0:59:49|0:59:52|His subordinates, seeing the situation, lowered their guard and retreated.
0:59:52|0:59:54|[The bald man] confronted the cold and aloof [Hei Yu] with words.
1:0:16|1:0:22|Hei Yu untied the cloth bag, and a strange bug with a look of emotion flew out, flapping its wings a few times before flying away immediately.
1:0:22|1:0:27|Hei Yu, feeling guilty for what she had done, returned to the room to find her teammates, looking around anxiously, afraid of being discovered.
1:0:27|1:0:34|Seeing [Ni Kongkong] still standing in place, [Hei Yu] quietly sat down by himself, while [Baldy] had already been tricked into drinking several pots of green wine.
1:0:39|1:0:42|[Ni Kongkong] pushed another wine pot hard into [Hei Yu]'s arms.
1:0:48|1:0:50|Ni Kongkong in front of the table was getting anxious.
1:0:50|1:0:55|The bald man looked at the enchanting figure, the swaying wine pot, and excitedly hummed a song.
1:0:55|1:1:4|[Hei Yu] finished it in one breath, smashed the wine pot, and vomited when doing things.
1:1:4|1:1:6|[Hei Yu] flees, with Ni Kongkong in hot pursuit.
1:1:15|1:1:18|Baldy became even angrier instantly.
1:1:18|1:1:29|Hei Yu's men behind him were once again driven back by a shout. Hei Yu sat on a rock, staring at the complete jade pendant, unaware that the bald man was quietly approaching. The bald man's eyes were drawn to the jade pendant.
1:1:29|1:1:30|Hei Yu was startled by the sudden turn.
1:1:33|1:1:37|On the other side, [Hei Yu], supported by [Ni Kongkong], is helping a rabbit by the wall.
1:2:34|1:2:36|Later on, he was dismissed from his position due to his lust and greed.
1:2:46|1:2:56|On the other side, drunk [Hei Yu] went crazy and wanted to fight with the bald guy, but [Ni Kongkong] couldn't stop him.
1:2:56|1:3:0|A soldier took the opportunity to make a move, [Ni Kongkong] quickly shielded [Hei Yu] and blocked a blow.
1:3:3|1:3:7|Fei Long's actions were like a fuse, igniting the entire Earth dance party.
1:3:7|1:3:12|The various factions settle their scores, but [Ni Kongkong] keeps [He Ying] at bay.
1:3:12|1:3:14|[Fei Long] rushes over.
1:3:24|1:3:31|Ni Kongkong knelt on the ground, holding Hei Yu tightly, the atmosphere suddenly tense, Hei Yu thought he had broken through the defense of the two.
1:3:31|1:3:37|[Hei Yu] smiled to ease the tension, while [Ni Kongkong] took the opportunity to stand up.
1:3:37|1:3:43|[Ni Kongkong] blocks [Hei Yu]'s eyes.
1:3:43|1:3:48|The guards arrived late on the mountain, facing [Ni Kongkong] and [Hei Yu] with their swords drawn.
1:3:55|1:3:58|[Jiang Chengzi] stepped forward and patted his shoulder.
1:4:13|1:4:16|[Jiang Chengzi] turned around as he was about to leave, then suddenly turned back to start explaining.
1:4:20|1:4:22|[Hei Yu] was so frightened that her face turned pale, and she fainted on the spot.
1:4:22|1:4:26|[Jiang Chengzi] didn't say much and was the first to leave.
1:4:26|1:4:28|[Ni Kongkong] asked in disbelief.
1:4:33|1:4:40|[Ni Kongkong] is somewhat afraid to look directly at Hei Yu.
1:4:40|1:4:42|Hei Li stepped forward, about to reach out and put his hand on [Ni Kongkong]'s shoulder.
1:4:46|1:4:47|[Ni Kongkong] quickly dodged.
1:4:51|1:4:53|After speaking, [Hei Yu] dragged the drunken [Hei Yu] and ran away.
1:4:53|1:4:57|Liu Xiahe stood there in a daze.
1:4:57|1:5:0|Lao Yuan was awakened by a bucket of water and sighed discontentedly.
1:5:5|1:5:7|[Hei Yu], dressed in new clothes, ran over.
1:5:14|1:5:19|[Ni Kongkong] squatted down and took out the treasure.
1:5:19|1:5:27|Lao Yuan straightened up, took the treasure box, carefully examined it in his hand, and looked at the patterns on it with some familiarity.
1:5:27|1:5:32|A group of people followed Lao Yuan to the residence, which was intricately designed inside.
1:5:37|1:5:40|Several people leaped into the depths of the cave and discovered a hidden paradise.
1:6:24|1:6:33|[Ni Kongkong] decisively opened the huge ancient book, causing a cloud of dust to rise, as several people gathered around to read the parchment book.
1:6:43|1:6:56|Lao Yuan inserted it into the bottom of the treasure chest and gently turned it. The mechanism of the treasure chest was triggered, and the light ball inside evoked neon-like memories.
1:7:9|1:7:27|During the war between humans and giants, [Hei Yu] slaughtered the Jiao tribe, obtaining the Jiao Pearl and the golden disc, which could open the Eye of the Sky and summon thousands of dark and terrifying flying demons.
1:7:39|1:7:44|The Emperor dispatched a warrior to infiltrate the Sky City.
1:7:44|1:7:52|When the gel bead once again emitted light, the warrior risked his life to seize it.
1:7:52|1:7:58|The human army, together with the benevolent feathered people, took advantage of the situation and defeated [Emperor Feather].
1:7:58|1:8:2|The hero was sealed, and that warrior disappeared from then on.
1:8:29|1:8:35|Every time my hand gets close, Lao Yuan grabs [Ni Kongkong]'s hand just as I'm about to examine it.
1:8:35|1:8:37|Suddenly, there was a commotion outside the stone cave.
1:8:39|1:8:48|[Hei Yu] pulled out a dagger and stabbed it directly into the gel bead, but the gel bead, along with the box, shook violently, breaking the dagger in [Hei Yu]'s hand.
1:8:48|1:8:51|[Hei Yu] can only close the box first and prepare to deal with the enemy.
1:9:0|1:9:1|Hei Yu looked excited.
1:9:7|1:9:11|A gust of cold wind extinguished the sparks in the cave.
1:9:11|1:9:15|With long hair and armor, [Feng Xiao] descends from the sky, looking down on the crowd.
1:9:15|1:9:16|[Hei Yu] exclaimed in surprise.
1:9:28|1:9:29|Taunting Xue Lie.
1:9:40|1:9:42|[Xue Lie] immediately drew his sword and prepared to learn a lesson.
1:9:42|1:9:45|[Xue Lie] grabbed the sword blade and kicked it away.
1:9:45|1:9:48|Feng's dual blades struck down, but were blocked by [Jiang Chengzi].
1:9:48|1:9:50|Feng turns around and kicks [Jiang Chengzi] away.
1:9:50|1:9:55|[Xue Lie] headed straight for [Hei Yu], [Ni Kongkong] quickly threw a smoke bomb and took [Hei Yu] away.
1:9:55|1:10:1|On the other side, Hei Yu was locked in a fierce battle, while Ni Kongkong fainted. Not long after escaping, Xue Lie with flapping wings blocked their way.
1:10:3|1:10:15|Ni Kongkong flew to kick, but was knocked back by Xue Lie's punch, Hei Yu thrust his sword, but was skillfully caught by Xue Lie, then punched in the abdomen and flew out, Emperor ran over to hold Xue Lie.
1:10:15|1:10:29|[Lao Yuan] kicked the whole pot into the stone cave mechanism, giving [Hei Yu] and others a chance to escape. [Xue Lie] was about to pounce on [Lao Yuan] and kick him away, but [Lao Yuan] took the opportunity to escape through the hole. At the same time, [Feng Xiao] didn't gain any advantage under [He Ying]'s hands, and when he saw [Xue Lie] approaching, he stepped forward to take the lead.
1:10:33|1:10:39|Here, [Hei Yu] and [Ni Kongkong] arrived at a stone well through a mechanism.
1:10:39|1:10:45|[Ni Kongkong] shot the grappling hook into the air, [Hei Yu] flapped his wings and took off, and the two of them escaped from the predicament.
1:10:45|1:10:50|Shirley made a move and knocked down Jiang Chengzi's henchmen with three punches and two kicks.
1:10:50|1:10:52|Hei Yu and [Jiang Chengzi] arrived late.
1:11:2|1:11:13|Hei Yu wielded his sword and charged forward, Xue Lie leaped up, dodged and then sneaked into Hei Yu's wrist, kicked him away with one foot, turning into a steel field, and was kicked into the air by Xue Lie.
1:11:13|1:11:26|[Feng Xiao] kicked [Hei Yu] with both feet, then turned and kicked the crossbeam, causing it to hit the wooden top of the cave. The top immediately revealed his whereabouts, hanging on the hook of the wind on the cave, causing [Ni Kongkong] to fall into the top of the cave without a sound.
1:11:29|1:11:34|In the new episode, [Hei Yu] flew over [Feng Xiao]'s attack and arrived at the top of the cave.
1:11:50|1:11:54|[Feng Xiao] leaped towards [Hei Yu] for a kick, but unexpectedly, [Hei Yu] spread his wings and flew away.
1:11:54|1:12:3|[Feng Xiao] refused to give up, leaping onto the stone gate, then throwing himself down from the gate, grabbing [Hei Yu] mid-flight and dragging him to the ground, choking him.
1:12:5|1:12:9|[Hei Yu] counterattacks with a swing, [Feng Xiao] is caught off guard, striking fiercely at [Hei Yu]'s wing orifice.
1:12:36|1:12:42|[Hei Yu] and [Feng Xiao] embraced each other as they leaped off the cliff, falling into the lake below together.
1:12:42|1:12:46|[Feng Xiao] struggled to return to the surface, but [Hei Yu] was determined not to yield.
1:12:46|1:12:53|Soon, the two arrived at the top of the lake. [Feng Xiao] quickly grabbed the swaying hemp rope next to him and reached out to wrap it around [Hei Yu]'s neck.
1:12:54|1:12:56|[Hei Yu] incredulously widened his eyes.
1:12:56|1:13:3|[Feng Xiao] tightened the hemp rope in his hand, [Hei Yu] gradually couldn't hold on anymore, opened his mouth, and the lake water immediately poured in.
1:13:3|1:13:7|The rope around the neck was pulled tight by [Feng Xiao], causing [Hei Yu] to close his eyes and faint.
1:13:7|1:13:12|[Feng Xiao] searched [Hei Yu] and pulled out a box from him.
1:13:12|1:13:16|[Feng Xiao] walked away after getting the box, ignoring the unconscious [Hei Yu].
1:13:21|1:13:26|[Xue Lie] held [Hei Yu] by the neck with one hand until he lost consciousness.
1:13:26|1:13:30|With another hand gathering strength, [Hei Yu] was hit and sent flying, crashing into a stone pillar.
1:13:30|1:13:35|The rocks collapsed, and the insects swarmed directly towards [Hei Yu], landing on his body.
1:13:35|1:13:41|The giant rock lifted up clouds of dust, and [Xue Lie] watched the scene calmly.
1:13:51|1:13:56|[Xue Lie] smiled satisfactorily, while [Hei Yu] sank to the bottom of the lake, completely losing consciousness.
1:13:56|1:14:1|He closed his eyes tightly, and there was no expression on his once lively face.
1:14:6|1:14:15|Hei Yu swam down with all his strength, just to save the most important person in his life.
1:14:15|1:14:21|[Ni Kongkong] gently tapped [Hei Yu]'s cheek on the shore.
1:14:21|1:14:27|[Hei Yu], who had lost consciousness, suddenly coughed up some stagnant water from the vicious spear.
1:14:27|1:14:28|[Hei Yu] slowly opened his eyes.
1:14:37|1:14:46|Upon hearing this, [Hei Yu] immediately struggled to get up. [Ni Kongkong] looked at [Hei Yu] in surprise. [Hei Yu] leaped up, ready to fly, but fell down before spreading his wings.
1:14:59|1:15:6|Hei Yu was struggling to move Jiang Chengzi out from under the pile of rocks, and the heavily injured Jiang Chengzi seemed to be at his limit.
1:15:6|1:15:8|Hei Yu anxiously stepped forward.
1:15:18|1:15:23|[Ni Kongkong] and [Hei Yu] rushed over upon hearing the sound, and He Li investigated the situation of [Jiang Chengzi].
1:15:23|1:15:28|The angry [Ni Kongkong] grabbed Hei Yu by the neck and pressed him in front of Jiang Chengzi's body.
1:16:29|1:16:32|Ge Li picked up the sword to leave, but was stopped by [Ni Kongkong].
1:16:38|1:16:41|[Hei Yu] was dissatisfied with the passive attitude of [Ni Kongkong].
1:16:41|1:16:44|[Ni Kongkong] dared not meet [Hei Yu]'s gaze, hesitated for a moment and said.
1:16:49|1:16:51|The companion on the side was somewhat surprised to hear this.
1:18:1|1:18:11|Hei Yu grimaced and reluctantly stepped back, while [Ni Kongkong] turned around, looking at the mess on the ground, feeling endless sorrow in her heart. The so-called friendship had turned into a bubble.
1:18:11|1:18:16|The night was dark and windy, with a small boat drifting on the river, its lantern flickering. Hei Yu on the boat was struggling to pull the sail.
1:18:18|1:18:23|[Hei Yu] came to the side of the boat, and Ge Li saw [Hei Yu] approaching, unconsciously stopping the movement in her hands.
1:18:23|1:18:27|The two of them locked eyes, and He Li immediately went back to work.
1:18:27|1:18:33|[Hei Yu] walked forward and kicked a small water bottle, which was carried by [Ni Kongkong].
1:18:33|1:18:38|[Hei Yu] hesitated for a moment, then bent down to pick it up, while [Jiang Chengzi] brushed past [Hei Yu]'s black hair.
1:18:38|1:18:43|And [Hei Yu] secured the sails of the boat, looking back at the distant grottoes.
1:18:43|1:18:44|The heart couldn't help but think of Ni Kongkong.
1:18:47|1:18:56|[Jiang Chengzi] drifted downstream, getting farther and farther away, facing the black rain that blocked the way, standing alone at the bow without daring to look back, afraid of disturbing the melancholy in his heart.
1:18:56|1:19:3|And so, the night quickly passed, with the bird songs welcoming the long-lost dawn, and the morning mist rising on the great river.
1:19:4|1:19:11|[Hei Yu] finished washing up, paying great attention to his appearance. He brushed off the dust on his body and straightened his collar.
1:19:11|1:19:14|After tidying up, [Ni Kongkong] noticed the swaying wind chimes.
1:19:14|1:19:18|He gently held the wind chime with both hands, silencing it.
1:19:18|1:19:24|After stabilizing himself, he caught a glimpse of three [Fei Long] flying towards the small boat in the distance in the corner of his eye.
1:19:24|1:19:25|He shouted loudly in a hurry.
1:19:43|1:19:47|[Hei Yu] listened and then turned his gaze to the person riding the dragon.
1:19:47|1:19:53|As Fei Long flew closer, Hei Yu and Ni Kongkong gradually saw that the person riding the dragon was none other than the famous Emperor.
1:20:29|1:20:32|[Ni Kongkong] landed [Fei Long] on the shore and spoke to the two of them.
1:20:54|1:20:59|[Ni Kongkong] stared intently at [Hei Yu], but [Hei Yu] deliberately ignored him, then he spoke.
1:21:3|1:21:5|[Fei Long] immediately became extremely obedient.
1:21:5|1:21:8|[Fei Long] immediately became extremely obedient.
1:21:8|1:21:9|[Fei Long] immediately became extremely obedient.
1:21:9|1:21:11|[Fei Long] immediately became extremely obedient.
1:21:11|1:21:12|[Fei Long] immediately became extremely obedient.
1:21:33|1:21:38|[Hei Yu] said, "Mount [Fei Long] and go ahead first, with [Ni Kongkong] following closely behind."
1:21:45|1:21:49|And so, the three of them rode on [Fei Long] soaring in the clouds, shouting excitedly.
1:22:27|1:22:31|Ni Kongkong made a face at Hei Yu with a straight face and said.
1:22:52|1:22:59|The night in Tian Du City was brightly lit, from the palace to the streets, everyone was watching lanterns and various performances.
1:22:59|1:23:5|The Emperor absentmindedly watched the enchanting dance with the others, and after a moment, he whispered.
1:23:23|1:23:27|In the streets, festive lanterns were hung in front of every household.
1:23:27|1:23:31|The people on both sides of the street excitedly watched the floats of the performance show.
1:23:31|1:23:36|The strong men pounded the big drum with all their might, and everyone was immersed in the joy of the festival at that moment.
1:23:36|1:23:43|The parade of performance floats is very large, in addition to the floats, there are also acrobatics, dances, and more behind.
1:23:43|1:23:48|But the most mysterious were a group of people wearing festive clothes and masks.
1:23:48|1:23:52|They neither sing nor dance, just follow the team and look around as they move forward.
1:23:52|1:23:57|Following the departure, they arrived at the city gate of the [Emperor].
1:23:57|1:24:1|At the same time, a mysterious ritual was taking place in the palace of [Xue Lie].
1:24:1|1:24:5|After the witch finished chanting the spell, the baby girl started moving in a creepy manner.
1:24:5|1:24:8|[Xue Lie] gathered all his subordinates together and spoke to them.
1:24:26|1:24:40|[Jiang Chengzi] said, and in the blink of an eye, they flew to the sky above Tiandu City.
1:24:40|1:24:44|After exchanging a smile with the mysterious person in the team, he flew towards the palace full of determination.
1:24:44|1:24:49|The mysterious figure who received instructions took off the mask and revealed weapons, it turned out to be [Feng Xiao] and his subordinates.
1:24:52|1:24:55|When the soldier with a gun in hand was discovered, it was already too late.
1:24:55|1:25:0|[Feng Xiao] wields two knives, effortlessly taking down the approaching soldiers one by one as if cutting vegetables.
1:25:0|1:25:5|He shows no desire for battle, after dealing with the soldiers in front of him, he stands still at the city gate with his spear.
1:25:5|1:25:13|The powerful [Feng Xiao] astonishingly pushed open the city gate with his own strength, leading many feathered people to charge into the city.
1:25:16|1:25:29|At the same time, the palace was also in turmoil. Taking advantage of the parade performance, the elite assassination team had already climbed up the city wall from the side with hooks, easily dealt with the guards, and quietly made their way to the main hall.
1:25:29|1:25:42|At this moment, chaos erupted in the imperial city. The guards rushed towards the palace to rescue the Emperor. Just as the troops stepped onto the iron rope bridge, [Xue Lie] ignited the giant stone protecting the city, smashing the bridge directly and causing the rescue troops to fall down.
1:25:42|1:25:47|On the grand hall, only a dozen of the Emperor's personal guards are struggling to hold on.
1:25:47|1:25:54|The situation is indeed critical, the Emperor himself had to draw his sword and join the battle with the other generals.
1:26:37|1:26:41|Excited [Ni Kongkong] rushed forward to engage in a battle with the other.
1:26:41|1:26:45|At the same time, [Yang Zhenhu], [Feng Xiao], and a few others arrived at the secret chamber of the palace.
1:26:47|1:26:59|[Xue Lie] flew to the front of the secret chamber door, retracted his wings behind him, then took out the stolen key, inserted it into the mechanism of the door, the heavy stone door slowly rose, [Xue Lie] and others with eager faces greeted the dream.
1:26:59|1:27:8|Just then, two cold arrows shot from behind [Xue Lie], [Xue Lie] quickly blocked them and rebounded the arrows back, [Yang Zhenhu] arrived with his men in time.
1:27:15|1:27:25|[Xue Lie] said, leading a few guards to walk elegantly towards the secret room, leaving [Feng Xiao] team and [Yang Zhenhu] to engage in a fierce battle, during which the shadow warriors shot darts at the [Emperor].
1:27:30|1:27:35|At this moment, [Xue Lie] has already passed through the winding corridors of the secret chamber and arrived at the main hall.
1:27:35|1:27:44|The grand hall was extremely dark, just like [Ni Kongkong], but the decorations around were exceptionally exquisite, indicating the former glory of this place from the fine craftsmanship of various stone carvings.
1:27:44|1:27:54|[Xue Lie] seems very familiar with this place. He spread his wings and leaped to the stone pillar in the center of the hall, then embedded the Sky Eye he snatched from Prince Jun Lake into the pillar.
1:27:54|1:27:59|In an instant, above the stone pillar, the true Eye of the Sky did not appear.
1:27:59|1:28:5|At this moment, Neon Palace and [Hei Yu] also arrived at the door of the secret room, leaping down from [Fei Long] to join the battle.
1:28:5|1:28:8|The arrival of the two inadvertently gave wings to the wild tiger of [Yang Zhenhu]'s army.
1:28:8|1:28:13|At this moment, Shadi's [Feng Xiao] saw [Hei Yu] and gritted his teeth, saying.
1:28:34|1:28:39|[Yang Zhenhu] was completely puzzled, but seeing Ni Honghong's anxious look, he followed him into the secret room.
1:28:39|1:28:42|As soon as the two of them walked into the alley, they were ambushed by the enemy.
1:28:55|1:28:59|The two of them defeated the enemies in front of them and prepared to walk towards the main hall.
1:28:59|1:29:9|At this moment, dozens of feathered people suddenly appeared and surrounded the two. [Ni Kongkong] saw the situation and quickly told [Hei Yu] to hold his breath. Then, [Hei Yu] let out a fart, causing many feathered people to faint directly from the stench.
1:29:9|1:29:13|Outside the door, the greatly improved [Hei Yu] and [Feng Xiao] were locked in a fierce battle.
1:29:13|1:29:20|After a dozen exchanges, [Hei Yu] unexpectedly gained the upper hand, forcing [Feng Xiao] to defend himself and even pushing him to the edge of the city wall.
1:29:20|1:29:23|In the palace, with the help of He Li, the situation was successfully turned around.
1:29:24|1:29:29|After eliminating the Feather Tribe soldiers, Hei Yu and the Emperor worked together to capture [He Ying] alive.
1:29:29|1:29:31|[He Ying] was forced to throw away her weapon and surrender.
1:29:31|1:29:36|On the other side, [Hei Yu] accidentally kicked [Feng Xiao] onto the spikes on the city wall.
1:30:6|1:30:13|In the secret room, [Xue Lie] is preparing to open the fusion of the gel beads and the Eye of the Sky.
1:30:16|1:30:21|Ni Kongkong puzzled Xue Lie with a move, and quickly snatched the glue bead from his hand.
1:30:21|1:30:25|Xue Lie, seeing the situation, chased after Ou Ka, and Yang Zhenhu struck with a sword.
1:30:25|1:30:28|Xue Lie dodged an attack by leaning to the side, then kicked and pushed the opponent back.
1:30:28|1:30:35|[Yang Zhenhu] was shocked by the power of Xue Lie. Although he found it hard to believe, in the face of the urgent situation, he had no choice but to fully engage in the battle.
1:30:36|1:30:44|Xue Lie easily dodged all of Yang Zhenhu's powerful attacks and even pierced through Yang Zhenhu's shoulder armor with bone spurs.
1:30:47|1:30:51|Okka hung from the rubber beads and started to run, but no matter how fast he ran, he couldn't outrun the flying Xue Lie.
1:30:55|1:31:0|[Ni Kongkong] caught the glue bead and turned to run, but was caught up by Xue Lie after just a few steps.
1:31:0|1:31:6|He tried to resist, but Xue Lie's heavy punch sent Ni Kongkong flying several seconds away.
1:31:6|1:31:11|He struggled to climb up with gritted teeth, but as soon as he looked up, he saw bone spikes coming towards him.
1:31:12|1:31:18|Just as Bone Spike was about to pierce him, Ni Kongkong suddenly pushed open the spray, but he was stabbed.
1:31:18|1:31:23|Xue Lie retracted his bone spurs, and Okka fell to the ground instantly, lifeless.
1:31:30|1:31:34|Xue Lie opened the box of Jiao Zhu and placed it in front of [He Ying].
1:31:34|1:31:37|After a moment, Jiao Zhu was sucked into the [Sky Shadow].
1:31:37|1:31:41|At the moment of their combination, Jiao Zhu unleashes tremendous power.
1:31:41|1:31:46|At this moment, Ni Kongkong couldn't care less about where Jiaozhu would go or what he would do. She held Okka and cried out.
1:32:22|1:32:32|Jiaozhu and [Ni Kongkong] merged briefly, and Jiaozhu's energy was fully activated, as a huge energy fluctuation gathered through [Ni Kongkong].
1:32:32|1:32:39|The next moment, all the energy turned into beams of light shooting into the sky, as if the huge energy of the gel beads tore open a hole in the sky.
1:32:39|1:32:50|Throughout the scene, everyone looked up in astonishment at the sky, except for [Ni Kongkong], who paid no attention. He slowly placed the okra on the ground and finally turned all his anger into strength, rushing towards the snow.
1:32:51|1:32:58|Ni Kongkong, after all, is just a physical body. Despite a shot of anger, in the face of absolute strength, it appears insignificant.
1:32:58|1:33:11|Xue Lie's ordinary punch sent Ni Kongkong flying again, at this moment, [Hei Yu] rushed over with the guards.
1:33:11|1:33:20|Two guards obeyed the order and dared not to be negligent. They reached out to try to take down the Jiao Zhu directly, but unexpectedly, they were instantly annihilated by the energy of the Jiao Zhu.
1:33:30|1:33:34|Through the windows of the great hall, [Ni Kongkong] looked eagerly at the cracks in the sky.
1:33:34|1:33:42|The cracks became more dazzling, and as energy was injected, dozens of splashes flew out of the cracks and scattered to various corners of Tian Du City.
1:33:42|1:33:45|The flying creature has a bird-like body, but with a strange shape.
1:33:45|1:33:51|The body has three pairs of small wings on both sides, the body is semi-transparent, and the mouth on the face is very sharp.
1:33:51|1:33:59|The people had never seen foam before and were very curious. A man stared intently at the foam beside him, even wanting to touch it with his hand.
1:33:59|1:34:2|The next moment, the spray suddenly attacked, directly drilling into the man's body.
1:34:3|1:34:21|Before the man could react, splashes burst out from his heart. Instantly, the people in the city scattered like a pot boiling over, while hundreds of splashes in the city kept chasing after them, continuously drilling into the bodies of the people. Even more terrifying, from the cracks in the sky, a dense swarm of splashes flew out.
1:34:21|1:34:26|Like a waterfall rushing towards the Heavenly Capital, the spray quickly descended onto the streets of the city.
1:34:27|1:34:35|Its destructive power is like a locust plague, causing grass to grow in an instant. With a small and agile body, it moves at an extremely fast speed. With such formidable characteristics combined, the [Emperor] issued the order upon seeing this.
1:35:4|1:35:8|The Emperor was about to give orders when he saw Hei Yu riding Fei Long into the sky.
1:35:32|1:35:38|Xue Lie said, with a fierce expression, drew out his own sword and rushed towards [Hei Yu], who drew his sword to defend.
1:35:38|1:35:45|Black Feather, who has grown wings, and the powerful Xue Lie fought fiercely for a short period of time, leaving Xue Lie surprised by the evenly matched battle.
1:35:45|1:35:52|[Hei Yu] seized the surprised sword move of Xue Lie, chopping off the armor on Xue Lie's left arm with a sword, but at the same time, he was kicked and sent flying.
1:35:52|1:35:57|[Hei Yu] ignored the pain and quickly got up from the ground to continue the fight.
1:35:57|1:36:10|Just then, as [Hei Yu] was getting the upper hand, [Ni Kongkong] slowly walked up to Jiao Zhu. After looking at the crack in the palm of his hand, he reached out directly to try to take the Jiao Zhu.
1:36:10|1:36:17|[Ni Kongkong], who could resonate with the Focus Bead, was not engulfed by its energy, but instead getting closer and closer to the Focus Bead.
1:36:19|1:36:23|Xue Lie cut off his wings, flew to [Ni Kongkong]'s side, and stabbed towards his chest with a sword.
1:36:30|1:36:35|Ni Kongkong was kicked away by Xue Lie, while [Hei Yu] flew to Xue Lie's chest to attack.
1:36:35|1:36:41|At this moment, [Feng Xiao] suddenly appeared and threw himself forward, shooting an arrow into the back of Xue Lie.
1:36:41|1:36:48|Xue Lie, injured, temporarily withdrew from the battle. Hei Yu and Feng Xiao quickly helped Ni Kongkong up.
1:36:55|1:37:12|Impatient [Hei Yu] had just finished speaking when he swung his sword towards Xue Lie once again. Meanwhile, [Ni Kongkong] knew his mission was to retrieve the gel bead. He leaped joyfully, reaching out towards the bead with all his might, trying to bring his palm closer to it. At that moment, the evil forces also joined the battle, helping [Ni Kongkong] buy time along with [Hei Yu].
1:37:12|1:37:30|The Snowsplit Sword unleashed its full power, first kicking the Evil Force unconscious, then forcing [Hei Yu] to retreat step by step. At the same time, the Heavenly City was already riddled with holes under the piercing spray, with cracks in the sky continuously spewing out the spray. Even the heavy city towers could not withstand the spray's attack and collapsed.
1:37:30|1:37:43|In the secret room, [Hei Yu] and Ge Li, although being repeatedly repelled by Xue Lie, did not hesitate at all to stand up time and time again in order to fight for time, stop Xue Lie's conspiracy, and protect the people of Tian Du City.
1:37:43|1:37:50|Although not a match for Xue Lie, even if they could fight for just one more second, they would rush up without hesitation.
1:37:50|1:37:57|After Xue Lie repelled two people, he leaped forward and shot an arrow straight towards [Ni Kongkong], with Fei Yu and Ge Li flying over trying to stop him.
1:37:57|1:38:3|Just as the arrow mark of Xue Lie was about to hit [Ni Kongkong], he successfully took the gel bead from the Eye of the Sky.
1:38:3|1:38:7|In an instant, a huge energy fluctuation sent everyone present flying.
1:38:7|1:38:17|The splashes raging in the city were shattered, without the surrendered energy, the cracks in the sky gradually closed, and the remaining splashes were sucked back by [Jing Shu].
1:38:17|1:38:24|After a night of battle, the first rays of morning sun once again greeted the Heavenly City, but [Hei Yu] lay motionless on the ground in the secret chamber.
1:38:41|1:38:46|Hei Yu placed his fingers in front of Ni Kongkong's nostrils and found that Ni Kongkong had no breath.
1:39:8|1:39:12|When [Hei Yu] was crying heartbreakingly, [Ni Kongkong] suddenly spoke up.
1:39:32|1:39:38|[Hei Yu] lightly punched [Ni Kongkong]'s chest, and [Ni Kongkong] grabbed his hand in response.
1:39:38|1:39:43|This time, [Hei Yu] did not refuse, but instead hooked fingers with [Ni Kongkong].
1:39:43|1:39:47|At this moment, [Ni Kongkong] became the indispensable person in [Hei Yu]'s heart.
1:39:47|1:39:48|Several days later, inside the palace.
1:39:57|1:40:14|The Emperor picked up the crown belonging to the Crown Prince from the tray and personally placed it on He Li's head. The shining gel beads were also sealed by [Yang Zhenhu] in the most secure chamber of the Zhenhu Bureau.
1:40:15|1:40:21|The Heavenly Capital has regained its former prosperity, and [Ni Kongkong] and the others found Lao Yuan with Ou Ka.
1:40:21|1:40:23|Lao Yuan took out the life-saving medicine and said.
1:40:26|1:40:36|She has been able to survive until now because [Xue Lie] released the Jiaozhu energy when she happened to be nearby.
1:41:26|1:41:33|Just as the few people were chatting and laughing, Okka's fingers moved lightly, and his palm glowed like [Ni Kongkong].
1:41:33|1:41:42|He finally showed signs of life, after experiencing a lot of black rain in the afternoon. Sitting on the edge of the cliff, he looked down at the rebuilt Tian Du City, contemplating life.
1:41:42|1:41:49|At this moment, [Ni Kongkong] walked up from behind and sat down next to [Hei Yu] gently. After exchanging a shy glance, the two of them.
1:41:49|1:41:51|[Ni Kongkong] took the initiative to ask.
1:42:26|1:42:35|[Ni Kongkong] hadn't finished speaking when [Hei Yu] grabbed his hand and jumped off the cliff, then spread his wings and flew, holding [Ni Kongkong] tightly in his arms.
1:42:35|1:42:41|[Ni Kongkong] also tightly held onto [Hei Yu] and didn't dare to let go. The two of them shuttled between the valleys for a while, and then flew into the clouds.
1:42:44|1:42:50|[Ni Kongkong] gradually stopped being afraid, looking at [Hei Yu] gently and happily.
1:42:50|1:43:5|At this moment, [Hei Yu] seemed to have noticed his gaze. The two of them looked deeply into each other's eyes, and suddenly, [Hei Yu] flew vertically upwards, carrying [Ni Kongkong] through the clouds and stopping in mid-air. Finally, the two of them settled deeply together.
1:43:5|1:43:12|[Ni Kongkong] touched [Hei Yu] with her sincerity and bravery, and the two of them lived together in harmony for the rest of their lives.
1:43:13|1:43:24|With Ni Kongkong having found a beautiful love, the fantasy journey is also coming to an end.
