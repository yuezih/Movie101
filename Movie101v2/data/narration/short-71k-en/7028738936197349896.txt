0:3:6|0:3:20|[Wan Xing] hadn't reacted yet when she was pushed forward by [Shifen], and [Shimiao] ran into the lone figure of [Wan Xing] on the escalator. At that moment, [Shimiao]'s best friend [Miao Miaomiao] was standing at the bookstore entrance flipping through a magazine.
0:3:46|0:3:53|[Miao Miaomiao] smiled and took out a hundred yuan bill to hand to the shop assistant, [Shimiao] looked at [Miao Miaomiao] gratefully, and blew her a kiss from a distance.
0:4:23|0:4:41|[Shifen] took out a small turtle. [Shimiao] looked at the cute turtle, her expression suddenly changing from cloudy to sunny. She released the hand on [Shifen] and carefully brought the small turtle in front of her. [Shimiao] touched the small turtle.
0:4:44|0:4:49|The scene cuts to the roadside, where a vendor is selling turtles with a sign that reads "Only 5 yuan".
0:4:49|0:4:54|Shimiao realized that she had been deceived. Her thoughts were pulled back to reality.
0:5:0|0:5:8|[Miao Miaomiao] immediately widened her eyes, looking at [Shimiao] with a face full of surprise and anticipation, as if there were stars twinkling in her eyes, followed by the appearance of the movie title.
0:5:8|0:5:24|With the sound of the bell signaling the start of class, [Zhen Kaixin] appeared outside the classroom carrying a stack of books. She struggled to walk into the classroom surrounded by a group of girls, sat down next to [Shifen], and [Wan Xing] next to her pulled on the dinosaur toy on [Shifen]'s body. [Zhen Kaixin] took out a stack of comic books and said.
0:5:29|0:5:36|[Zhen Kaixin] glanced at the empty bench, and [Shifen] turned around and gave a shy smile.
0:5:54|0:6:0|[Shimiao] picked up her phone, turned off the alarm, only to find that her hair was tied to the bedpost with ribbons.
0:6:1|0:6:5|She picked up the mirror and found her head full of small braids.
0:6:7|0:6:27|After washing her hair, she opened the cabinet and took out a relatively clean towel. Then, as she dried her hair, she pushed open the door to the balcony. Walking to the mirror, she adjusted the stray hairs on her forehead and casually picked up the hairdryer on the table. As soon as she turned it on, she was sprayed in the face with flour, causing her to cough uncontrollably. The scene then shifted to her opening the fridge, only to find it empty.
0:6:27|0:6:33|A sticky note reads: "Losing weight requires support, don't thank me too much."
0:6:39|0:6:46|[Shimiao] helplessly closed the bedroom door and ran anxiously towards the door. The moment she opened it, she saw the backpack that her brother [Shifen] had forgotten.
0:6:46|0:6:54|She closed the door and left with determination, but after a few steps, she felt reluctant and turned back.
0:6:54|0:7:2|She angrily picked up Shifen's backpack and left, slamming the door. Shimiao ran down the stairs from one floor to another, pushing aside the clothes and blankets hanging on the roadside.
0:7:2|0:7:14|Passing by the uncles and aunties exercising downstairs, she arrived at the bottom of a long staircase and struggled to run up. At the top of the stairs was the road, where [Shimiao] finally reached.
0:7:22|0:7:28|[Shifen] was leaning on the table playing with a jigsaw puzzle, [Wan Sui] handed her the phone, and [Shifen] took it with a mischievous smile.
0:7:28|0:7:37|On the bus, [Shimiao] was squeezed against the window when suddenly she received a message from [Shifen], who said, "My dear sister, where is my bag?"
0:7:37|0:7:45|[Shimiao] finished reading the message and couldn't help but roll her eyes. Running at the speed of a 100-meter dash, she hurried towards the school gate as she was about to be late.
0:7:48|0:7:56|Shifen sent another message saying, "Dear sister, brother's bag is not important at all, just make sure you're not late, love you." Shimiao angrily put down her phone and ran forward, panting heavily.
0:8:10|0:8:14|She parked the car in the middle of the closing gate and waved at [Shimiao].
0:8:14|0:8:26|Shimiao had her arm around Miao Miaomiao's shoulder as they stood on the back seat of the electric bike, driving into the campus. They passed through the lush tree-lined path, with sunlight shining through the leaves' gaps, both of them laughing happily.
0:8:26|0:8:33|Shimiao excitedly raised her hand above her head, and Shifen sent a message: "The bell for preparation is ringing, quickly bring the bag to Brother."
0:8:55|0:9:1|Shimiao stood still in disbelief upon hearing Miao Miaomiao's words, feeling deflated instantly.
0:9:3|0:9:11|Shimiao turned her head in confusion. The teacher threw the phone on the table.
0:9:30|0:9:38|After reaching an agreement, [Shimiao] decided to help [Shifen] cover up the lie. While the teacher was checking the phone, [Shifen] turned to [Shimiao] and pretended to be angry.
0:9:39|0:9:41|Expresses disapproval of her risky behavior at this moment.
0:9:47|0:9:54|The plan was successful, the two of them exchanged a knowing smile, and at that moment the teacher picked up their contact books and began to compare them.
0:9:54|0:9:56|No abnormalities were found afterwards.
0:10:17|0:10:26|[Shifen] was momentarily speechless, [Shimiao] stared in disbelief, then spoke.
0:11:11|0:11:30|[Wan Sui] held a test paper with a score of 99, smirked in a pretentious manner, looked satisfied at the paper. Beside him, [Zhen Kaixin] held a test paper with a score of 90, eyes shining with joy, laughing like a fool. [Shimiao] walked out of the office with red eyes, crying, and turned the corner expressionless.
0:12:13|0:12:18|On the way home from school, [Shimiao] handed three grilled sausages to [Shifen], who took them and took a bite of each one.
0:12:28|0:12:32|[Shifen] pouted and furrowed her brows, looking at [Shimiao] with a look of grievance.
0:12:32|0:12:37|Shimiao deliberately looked away, but hesitated for a moment and said,
0:12:37|0:12:44|[Shifen] nodded, and [Shimiao] handed the grilled sausage to her mouth. [Shifen] opened her mouth wide, but missed it.
0:12:53|0:12:58|Shimiao didn't notice the sneak attack from Shifen behind her as she spoke, and in the blink of an eye, both sausages were taken away.
0:12:58|0:13:2|[Shifen] was twisting around smugly while biting on a sausage.
0:13:11|0:13:18|Shimiao choked on a sausage and said incoherently,
0:13:31|0:13:39|Watching [Shifen] acting smugly, [Shimiao] screamed in anger and ran towards her, scolding as she ran. [Shifen] ran very fast and soon disappeared from sight.
0:13:39|0:13:45|[Shimiao] chased into a dark tunnel, where strange items were piled up.
0:13:47|0:14:0|Shimiao shouted loudly but no one responded to her. Eerie dripping sounds echoed in the empty tunnel. Shimiao stood at the entrance of the tunnel, hesitating to move. She took out her phone from her bag, turned on the flashlight, and frowned as she shone it around.
0:14:0|0:14:3|Fear gradually surged in her heart.
0:14:6|0:14:24|At this moment, [Shimiao] was startled by a doll hanging upside down without arms on the top of the tunnel. The tattered cloth around was blowing in the wind, creating a creepy atmosphere. [Shimiao] looked around in fear, but still took slow steps forward. She walked cautiously, while the small lamp on the wall flickered eerily.
0:14:59|0:15:4|[Shifen] suddenly appeared from behind, causing [Shimiao] to scream in fright, standing frozen in place.
0:15:5|0:15:13|Shimiao picked up the school bag and smashed it on Shifen's body, and Shifen laughed and ran away.
0:16:34|0:16:38|Mom comforted the aggrieved [Shimiao], then turned and gave [Shifen] a big eye roll.
0:16:38|0:16:42|Shimiao watched her mother leave in a hurry, standing in place sadly.
0:16:58|0:17:8|The father sitting on the sofa suddenly stood up, roared angrily at the siblings who were playing, then walked towards the door. After a slamming sound of the door, only the two siblings were left in the room.
0:17:46|0:17:52|On the phone, [Miao Miaomiao] didn't pay attention, only focusing on the updates of her idol.
0:17:59|0:18:10|[Shimiao] was still feeling down, but she was interrupted by a call from her best friend, so she put down her phone in disappointment. [Shifen] was sitting on the bed in the bedroom, playing a voice-controlled game, howling excitedly at the phone.
0:18:10|0:18:33|[Shifen] was feeling full of resentment with nowhere to vent, but when she saw [Shimiao] dancing around, her anger erupted. She stormed into the room littered with scraps of paper, glaring fiercely at [Shifen] as she shouted at her. Ignoring her sister's scolding, [Shifen] continued playing her game without even looking up. Feeling helpless, [Shimiao] pondered for a moment before picking up the Iron Man action figure on the table.
0:18:33|0:18:43|She then moved a nearby stool and stood on it. She leaned over the edge of the upper bunk, looking expressionless at [Shifen] on the bed, slowly raising her hand as if to break the figurine.
0:19:6|0:19:18|She snatched the phone from [Shifen]'s hand and threw it away, then caught it with her hand in front of [Shifen]. [Shifen] was immersed in the game, yelling loudly at the phone. In a fit of anger, [Shimiao] took the phone away, forcibly interrupting the game.
0:19:31|0:19:39|[Shifen] gives [Shimiao] another bag of puffed food, while also scaring her. [Shimiao] glares fiercely at [Shifen] and throws the snack bag at her.
0:19:39|0:20:6|Shifen glanced back at Shimiao vigilantly, then turned and walked out humming a song. Shimiao, feeling annoyed, stomped on the snacks that had fallen on the ground in frustration. After venting her anger, she suddenly noticed a flyer on the table. Upon picking it up, she saw it was a promotional flyer for her brother Shifen's trading card event. Shimiao pushed aside the snacks covering the table and saw a nearly completed puzzle. She looked up in shock.
0:20:9|0:20:33|She held up the flyer in front of her eyes, looking at the grand prize on it and getting lost in a daydream. In the daydream, the whole family of [Shimiao] won the grand prize, surrounded by applause and cheers. The family of four dressed in clothes just like the cartoon characters on the flyer, with horns on their heads. [Shimiao] couldn't help but smile, her mouth curling up like a fool as she imagined it.
0:20:33|0:21:2|Shifen walked out of the bathroom and was startled by Shimiao in front of her. Shimiao was holding a laundry basket and looking at Shifen with a flattering expression. Shifen looked at the unusual Shimiao as if she was looking at a monster, threw the changed clothes into the laundry basket, wiped her wet hair, turned around and walked upstairs. Shimiao immediately put down the laundry basket in her hand, turned around and ran outside. She quickly ran up the stairs and arrived upstairs before Shifen.
0:21:2|0:21:38|She stole a glance at the movement of [Shifen], took advantage of her not coming up yet, stood by the mirror and raised the hairdryer. When [Shifen] walked in, [Shimiao] shivered and took a step back, quite scared. [Shimiao], however, smiled and handed the hairdryer to her. Worried that [Shimiao] might play a trick, [Shifen] turned on the hairdryer and aimed it at [Shimiao]'s face, but nothing happened. [Shifen] looked even more scared at [Shimiao]'s smile, puzzled, she scratched her head and walked towards the door.
0:21:38|0:21:47|She was worried that [Shimiao] would sneak up on her, so she couldn't help but turn her head to look at her. [Shimiao] responded with a pair of innocent eyes, and [Shifen] left uneasily.
0:21:47|0:22:4|Upon seeing [Shimiao] walk out, [Shifen] immediately turned around and ran downstairs. Just as [Shifen] reached the living room after coming down the stairs, she sat on the sofa and suddenly a hand next to her placed a glass of juice in front of her, causing her to shrink into a ball and widen her eyes in shock.
0:22:28|0:22:35|Shimiao said, taking out Shifen's puzzle from the side and saying,
0:22:50|0:23:15|[Shimiao] nodded obediently and handed the puzzle to [Shifen]. [Shifen] reached out carefully to take it, but [Shimiao] refused to let go. [Shifen] pulled with all her might, while [Shimiao] looked at her with a smile on her face. Suddenly, she let go of the puzzle, and [Shimiao] made a victorious gesture towards [Shifen], who was still in shock from the scare, sitting motionless holding the puzzle.
0:23:15|0:23:22|Shimiao walked to the staircase, suddenly turned around and looked at Shifen, saying,
0:23:23|0:23:40|[Shifen] turned to look at the affected [Shimiao], grimacing in pain. [Shimiao] skipped upstairs, excitedly rushing to her own bed. Then she shouted from behind, as [Shifen] slowly made her way upstairs and reluctantly pressed the switch on the wall.
0:23:40|0:24:0|The next day, [Shimiao] and [Shifen] arrived at a convenience store where several boxes of puffed snacks were placed in front of them. [Shifen] glanced disapprovingly at the shopkeeper, while [Shimiao] turned her head indifferently and sighed before saying,
0:24:56|0:25:13|Working [Shimiao]'s mother turned her head and looked over, seeing the flowers in front of her with a puzzled expression. She picked up the card on the bouquet, opened it, and fell silent upon reading it, her face turning very unpleasant. Meanwhile, the customers and children beside her were laughing happily.
0:25:13|0:25:27|After a busy day at work, as the sky darkened, [Shimiao]'s mother stood by the window, staring blankly at the outside scenery, feeling low. Then, with red eyes, she turned around and looked at the bouquet behind her, picked it up and walked out.
0:25:27|0:25:31|Returning home, [Ma Dongmei] threw the flowers in front of [Ba Ba].
0:25:38|0:25:53|[Shifen] walked over, picked up the card on the flowers and said, "Dad roared angrily, Mom got even angrier, grabbed the flowers and was about to throw them out."
0:26:3|0:26:20|[Shimiao] suddenly rushed over and hugged her mother, calming her anger. Her mother then turned around, tenderly held [Shimiao]'s face, and kissed her on the cheek before embracing her. Meanwhile, her brother [Shifen] stood by with a cold expression. [Shimiao] had a happy smile on her face, but little did she know that her mother would decisively leave the next moment.
0:26:20|0:26:44|[Shimiao] watched her mother leave, the smile on her face slowly fading away. She stood there in a daze, realizing that her carefully planned scheme had failed. Tears welled up in [Shimiao]'s eyes as she felt wronged. Just as she was about to get angry, she saw [Shifen] putting flowers on her head and making a funny gesture. [Shimiao] burst into laughter through her tears.
0:27:9|0:27:16|Shimiao looked at Miao Miaomiao with an urgent gaze and said after a moment of thought, Shimiao was shocked by her bad idea.
0:27:20|0:27:29|[Shimiao] was at a loss for words for a moment, so she could only cry with a sad face. Suddenly, she received a text message, and the dark clouds on her face disappeared instantly.
0:27:48|0:27:55|[Shimiao] pulled [Miao Miaomiao] with excitement and joy, laughing heartily. Then she walked alone to the entrance of the ice cream shop.
0:27:55|0:28:5|But [Zhen Kaixin] didn't show up, only a text message from [Shifen] came. The message said, "Sis, no one is asking you out for ice cream, I made a mistake."
0:28:5|0:28:15|If you're already there, just grab me an ice cream on your way back, [Shimiao] angrily closed her phone, took a few steps, then turned back to kick the toy at the door before leaving.
0:28:18|0:28:45|[Shimiao] was alone, leaning on the railing of the bridge, eating ice cream. With a frown and pouting lips, [Shimiao] looked around at the children playing and laughing nearby. Several children were waving toys in the company of their parents, who were indulgently smiling and blowing bubbles for them. [Shimiao] cast an envious glance at them.
0:28:51|0:29:20|She felt very wronged, stared at her phone blankly, then put it down and looked at the river under the bridge. The reflection of the opposite building on the water surface was particularly beautiful in the sunset. [Shimiao] seemed to remember something suddenly, picked up her phone and dialed home. She hoped her father would answer, but there was no one at home. Her father, dressed in a suit and carrying a briefcase, was lying drunk at the doorstep, snoring unconsciously, with even the keys dropped on the ground beside him.
0:29:20|0:29:26|The phone rang for a long time without anyone answering, [Shimiao] hung up disappointedly, muttering to herself.
0:29:33|0:30:3|She expressed her emotions word by word on her phone, seeming to be in a fit of anger. After saying these words fiercely, she calmed down and looked across. A figure caught her attention, it was [Shimiao]'s mother walking along the riverbank with a strange man. Recognizing her mother, [Shimiao] quickly turned around and prepared to find a way to the other side.
0:30:4|0:30:31|The sun quickly set, and the riverside became brightly lit with lights, reflecting the twinkling lights in the water. [Shimiao] still held the unfinished ice cream jar in her hand as she found where her mother was. She saw her mother walking towards her with a stranger, so [Shimiao] quickly hid and observed from the side. When she saw the two of them enter a restaurant, she stuck her head out and hurriedly followed. She hid outside the restaurant, peering in.
0:30:36|0:30:46|Unexpectedly, [Shimiao] found her brother [Shifen] also appeared in the restaurant. The scene in front of her greatly shocked [Shimiao], and she desperately wanted to know what they were talking about, but she couldn't hear clearly.
0:30:47|0:30:53|She turned around to look for the window on the other side of the restaurant, and then she saw three people chatting harmoniously.
0:31:8|0:31:36|Seeing the three of them chatting and laughing, seeing the radiant smile on her brother's face, [Shimiao] understood everything. In an instant, her eyes became moist, and she coldly looked at the three in front of her, slowly turned around and left. She felt her world collapsing, never expecting that the person closest to her had been deceiving her all along, shattering all the hopes she had carefully maintained.
0:31:37|0:31:58|She ignored a clown waving at her beside her, walking on the road like a zombie, still tightly holding the melted ice cream in her hand. [Shimiao] walked for a long time, finally stopping in front of a dilapidated old ship. She looked up at the ship in contemplation, disappointment evident in her eyes. At this moment, an old man picking up trash appeared beside her.
0:31:59|0:32:13|The old man, dressed in tattered clothes with messy hair under his hat, was asked by [Shimiao], "What are you doing?" as he picked up bottles and replied,
0:32:22|0:32:26|Shimiao looked up again and watched the steamboat sink into contemplation.
0:32:26|0:32:48|She couldn't help but walk into the cabin, wanting to see the memories of her childhood. The cabin was pitch black, with only a beam of light shining in from outside, barely illuminating the surroundings. [Shimiao] walked down the stairs, and several pigeons lurking here scattered away when they heard the noise. She looked at the desolation in front of her, with a lonely expression. The happy memories of her childhood suddenly rushed into her heart.
0:33:6|0:33:34|In the memory, the family celebrated [Shimiao]'s birthday when she was a child. Her brother [Shifen] sat beside her, while their parents sat opposite each other, showing affection as always. The family sang a birthday song for Shimiao, creating a harmonious atmosphere. As the scene shifts back to reality, Shimiao finds the table from her memory and leans on it, tears streaming down her face uncontrollably. At that moment, [Shifen] appears outside the ferry in school uniform, wearing a helmet and riding a new electric bike.
0:33:34|0:33:40|Before long, [Shimiao] rode her electric bike into the cabin, and the headlights illuminated the dark restaurant.
0:33:40|0:34:7|On the side, a pigeon suddenly flew up, startling [Shifen] who quickly stopped. [Shimiao] remained silent, just staring at [Shifen]'s electric bike. Unaware of [Shifen]'s low mood, [Shimiao] continued to inspect the surroundings on her own. She pressed a hidden switch in the corner, and the ship was instantly enveloped in light.
0:34:23|0:34:29|[Shifen] excitedly twists and turns in the seat,
0:34:59|0:35:8|[Shifen] took out her phone and turned the screen towards [Shimiao], revealing a virtual animated candle.
0:35:42|0:35:55|As the candle went out, the birthday song sung by [Shifen] for [Shimiao] played on the phone. Following that, the smoke from the candle enveloped the entire city, and [Shimiao] appeared in the classroom.
0:35:59|0:36:16|In a drowsy state, [Shimiao] was pulled up from the desk by [Miao Miaomiao] and hurriedly left the classroom. The two arrived at the basketball court, where an exciting and tense basketball game was taking place. The stands were full, with everyone holding cheer sticks and shouting support for their school.
0:36:16|0:36:24|The cheerleaders below the stage were also not to be outdone, shouting in unison. [Shifen], wearing the number 23 jersey, appeared in the center of the field, becoming the focus.
0:36:25|0:36:48|She skillfully maneuvered the ball around and smoothly scored with a fake move, prompting cheers from the sidelines. [Miaomiao] shouted [Shifen]'s name, excitedly embracing [Shimiao] next to her. [Shimiao] looked puzzled at [Miaomiao], as [Shifen] scored two points for the school. Celebrating with teammates on the sidelines, [Miaomiao] in the stands mirrored their celebratory gestures.
0:37:3|0:37:23|[Miao Miaomiao] excitedly shouted, while [Shimiao] next to her had a gloomy face and put her phone in her pocket. At this moment, [Shifen] jumped up to shoot, but was knocked down by the opponent. After falling to the ground, [Shifen] fainted. [Miao Miaomiao] immediately turned around to look for an exit, while [Shimiao] directly climbed over the railing and ran straight towards the court.
0:37:23|0:38:4|She checked on Shifen's condition, Shimiao rushed aggressively towards the player who committed a foul, knocking him down. Miaomiao shouted for her brother as she ran over from the side. Suddenly, Shifen woke up. Miaomiao was startled and angrily patted Shimiao. The two stood still for a moment before heading to the medical room. As usual, Shifen teased her sister, but this time it was Miao Miaomiao.
0:38:14|0:38:22|She suddenly noticed a list on the table next to her, picked it up and saw the name [Shifen] written on it.
0:38:37|0:38:42|Miao Miaomiao stood still, looking puzzled, and asked,
0:39:16|0:39:22|Shimiao looked up at Wan Sui, who felt uneasy under her gaze and quickly averted his eyes before hurriedly leaving.
0:40:12|0:40:20|[Shifen] gave [Miao Miaomiao] a hard pinch from behind.
0:40:26|0:40:41|[Shimiao] hid at the doorway, taking everything in. She couldn't accept this outrageous fact. After school, [Shifen] and [Miao Miaomiao] frolicked all the way, with [Shimiao] following behind. She watched the two intimate friends and felt extremely wronged.
0:40:49|0:40:57|After suppressing her emotions all the way, [Shimiao] finally couldn't hold it anymore. [Miao Miaomiao] and [Shifen] turned to look at her. After a moment of contemplation, [Shimiao] spoke,
0:41:4|0:41:12|Facing Shimiao's question, the two of them nodded in unison, and Shimiao analyzed seriously,
0:42:28|0:42:49|In the wardrobe, there were no clothes of [Shimiao] left, even her daily necessities had disappeared. [Shimiao] stood still, realizing the seriousness of the situation. She returned to her room and found that even the spare change in the piggy bank had miraculously returned. Looking around, the stickers and posters on the walls had all turned into things she liked.
0:42:49|0:43:4|The entire house no longer had a trace of the existence of the brother [Shifen]. At this moment, the mother called, and [Shimiao] eagerly answered the phone. The living room's photo wall also no longer had the figure of [Shifen].
0:43:12|0:43:38|[Shimiao] replied while looking around incredulously. Once again, she noticed that she was the only one left on the height markings on the living room pillar. Even the restaurant in her memory had not closed down. Opening the fridge, [Shimiao] saw a variety of snacks inside and couldn't help but laugh. She casually took out two pieces of bread, staring at the fridge filled with food in a daze. In disbelief, she muttered to herself,
0:43:38|0:43:55|She became more and more excited as she watched, and all of [Shimiao]'s confusion was washed away by the joy of enjoying the meal alone.
0:43:55|0:44:15|She sat on the sofa holding an ice cream, carefully scooping out a small piece with a spoon. When the taste of the ice cream touched her tongue, she instantly showed an incredibly happy expression. Unable to resist, she ate it heartily, feeling her soul being uplifted.
0:44:15|0:44:22|Shimiao dismissed her brother Shifen's disappearance from her mind and became the only child as she had wished.
0:44:22|0:44:26|She then changed into new clothes and tied up her hair, and arrived at the restaurant that was supposed to have closed down.
0:44:27|0:44:40|The ship was surrounded by colorful lights, just like in childhood, it became lively and extraordinary. From a distance, it looked like a grand party was being held. [Shimiao] slowly walked up and lingered around the ship.
0:44:40|0:44:48|She then walked into the cabin and immediately saw her parents dressed up. When her mother saw [Shimiao], she waved affectionately at her, signaling her to come over.
0:44:48|0:44:53|[Shimiao] almost ran over, looking at her parents, she instantly burst into a smile.
0:45:8|0:45:23|Mom touched [Shimiao]'s face, and [Shimiao] took both of their hands and put them together, saying. Dad smiled kindly and said,
0:45:34|0:45:40|Mom touched Shimiao's heart, not wanting to embarrass her. The three looked up at the romantic lights around them, and Dad said,
0:45:43|0:46:7|Dad stood up as he spoke, and before Mom could react, he pulled her towards the dance floor. The two of them danced to the beautiful music, occasionally casting indulgent smiles at [Shimiao]. Watching the graceful dance of their parents, [Miaomiao] couldn't stop smiling, as if she were in a beautiful dream, back at home enjoying the exclusive love of her parents, freely skating around the house.
0:46:7|0:46:18|Dad sat at the desk in the study working, while Mom sat on the sofa in the living room looking at her phone. However, what Shimiao didn't notice was the bottle of alcohol hidden under the desk by Dad, and the disappearing smile on Mom's face.
0:46:19|0:46:27|At night, [Shimiao] lay on the bed and habitually called out, she just closed her eyes and suddenly realized that [Shifen] was no longer at home.
0:46:30|0:46:46|A hint of disappointment flashed across her face, but it was soon overshadowed by the emotions of [Zhen Kaixin]. She smiled and called out again, as her father walked up the stairs, looking at [Shimiao] affectionately and said,
0:46:50|0:47:9|After turning off the lights, Dad turned his head and made a scissor gesture towards [Shimiao]. The next day, [Shimiao] proudly rode an electric bike in her school uniform past the bus stop. She wore headphones, with a satisfied smile on her face, calmly walking on her way to school. She felt extremely happy that she no longer had to squeeze onto the bus or worry about being late.
0:47:9|0:47:14|At this moment, she encountered [Miao Miaomiao] running wildly on the road.
0:48:3|0:48:10|[Miao Miaomiao] clasped her hands together in a gesture of grievance, furrowing her brow and looking up at [Shimiao] with innocent, wide eyes.
0:48:23|0:48:41|Kaixin smiled and said to Wan Xing. Wan Xing looked at Kaixin coldly without saying a word, while Shimiao beside her showed a silly smile. Miaomiao was hanging in the air, screaming in terror at the monster puppet beside her.
0:48:59|0:49:14|The scene cuts to [Miao Miaomiao] at home with a floor full of lunch boxes, while frantically serving rice on the side. When [Shimiao] walks in, she is stunned by this spectacular sight and laughs, saying,
0:49:36|0:49:53|[Shifen] walked in with a bunch of screaming chickens hanging on him. He swaggered in, swaying his hips, holding a screaming chicken in his hand instead of answering for himself to [Miao Miaomiao]. [Shimiao] sat down on the ground and couldn't help but stare at him.
0:50:11|0:50:18|Miao Miaomiao rushed forward to grab it as soon as she noticed it.
0:50:32|0:50:37|[Shifen] opened a bottle of drink next to him and started drinking. [Miao Miaomiao] realized and asked,
0:50:48|0:51:4|[Shimiao] sat on the ground watching the two playfully fighting, suddenly feeling like an outsider, she couldn't help but feel sad. She recalled the bits and pieces of her childhood with [Shifen], but the main characters of the story had now become [Shifen] and [Miao Miaomiao].
0:51:4|0:51:30|In her memories, [Shifen] snatched her sister's ice cream and even blocked the door, not letting her in. [Shimiao] returned to the empty house, every corner reminding her of [Shifen]. At this moment, [Shifen] was on the street looking for her drunken father, when her mother suddenly called. [Shifen] glanced at the phone, pondered for a moment, and then hung up.
0:51:30|0:51:52|Father lay on the roadside railing, drunk and unconscious. [Shifen] looked at him helplessly and sighed, then walked over and squatted down. He stared at his father for a while, then snapped out of it, stood up and squatted beside his father. He took out a cigarette, put it in his father's mouth, and carefully lit it with a lighter. Father was sleeping too soundly, with no reaction at all.
0:51:53|0:52:2|[Shifen] sat on the ground waiting for her father to wake up. A considerate aunt passed by and picked up a small stool, saying to [Shifen],
0:52:3|0:52:21|Shifen nodded, smiled politely, waved to the aunt, and the father beside her started coughing from the smoke. Shifen quickly took out the cigarette, saw that her father was still unconscious, put the cigarette back into his mouth, and then waited quietly on the side, staring blankly at the sky with boredom.
0:52:21|0:52:36|In the late night with no one around, [Shifen] finally carried his father on his back to go home. His face was cold and expressionless, completely different from the cheerful [Shifen] during the day. With his frail body, he carried his father and took heavy steps forward.
0:52:41|0:52:52|The next day, [Miao Miaomiao] stood by the school fence buying a hot dog. [Shifen] walked by from the side, signaling to his friends, sneaking up and hiding in the crowd.
0:52:52|0:53:5|Miao Miaomiao bought a sausage and walked back while smelling the fragrance, completely unaware of Shifen in the crowd. Zhen Kaixin deliberately waved to Miao Miaomiao to attract her attention, while Shifen sneaked up from behind and took a bite, biting off Miao Miaomiao's sausage.
0:53:38|0:54:0|[Shifen] grabbed [Kaixin]'s water bottle and took a sip. When he got home, [Wan Xing] opened the fridge and took out a drink. Just as he was about to open the bottle cap to drink, [Wan Sui] suddenly appeared, snatched [Wan Xing]'s water bottle, took a sip, and then handed it back to him. [Wan Xing] stood still, watching [Wan Sui] walk away, lost in thought.
0:54:0|0:54:16|But the next morning, when [Wan Sui] left for school, he found the bottle of drink on the dining table. He picked it up and saw his name on the bottle. Opening the fridge, [Wan Sui] discovered that everything was labeled with the names of [Wan Sui] and [Wan Xing].
0:54:17|0:54:40|At this moment, [Shimiao] and [Miao Miaomiao] are browsing through the fan merchandise store. However, [Miao Miaomiao] is feeling down, staying silent and reluctantly pursing her lips. [Shimiao] rolls her eyes and suddenly [Shifen] runs over.
0:55:50|0:55:57|[Shimiao] grabbed [Shifen]'s school bag and the puzzle pieces inside scattered all over the floor, but she was unrepentant.
0:56:15|0:56:21|[Shifen] complained to [Zhen Kaixin] and [Wan Sui],
0:56:35|0:56:40|Shifen, Zhen Kaixin, and Wan Sui were squatting by the roadside, searching for rare cards in puffed snacks.
0:57:4|0:57:16|[Shifen] quickly turned around and saw a child buying a pack of instant noodles, taking out the rare card that [Shifen] had been longing for. [Shifen] revealed a hungry wolf-like look in the eyes.
0:57:40|0:57:45|[Shimiao] and [Miao Miaomiao] are watching the little rabbits by the roadside.
0:57:54|0:58:6|[Shifen] panicked and blurted out incoherently, [Shimiao] and [Miao Miaomiao] noticed the situation here. Just as [Shifen] was about to turn and run, more people came from behind.
0:58:18|0:58:43|[Shimiao] let [Miao Miaomiao] call the police, and then chased after them without hesitation. [Shifen] and the other two were chased by the gangsters and ran straight to the escalator ahead. Several gangsters followed closely behind, with one of them cleverly running towards the adjacent elevator, trying to intercept [Shifen] and the others halfway. The three of them ran forward in a very embarrassed manner, with the people behind them shouting not to run and chasing after them relentlessly.
0:58:44|0:59:5|At this moment, [Shimiao] rushed over and saw the chaotic scene upstairs. She hurriedly chased after them. Several thugs were already panting as they ran away, but they refused to give up. [Shifen] and the other two panicked and ran up the stairs without thinking. Unconsciously, they reached the top floor. The three of them looked dumbfounded at the dead-end rooftop. The young thugs behind them also caught up. [Shifen] had a sudden inspiration and threw herself into the corner of the rooftop.
0:59:7|0:59:25|He picked up several umbrellas and threw them to [Zhen Kaixin] and [Wan Sui] as weapons. The few hooligans gasped for breath and also began to search for handy weapons near the rooftop. [Shifen] and the other two opened the umbrellas, ready to face the upcoming battle.
0:59:25|0:59:35|Suddenly, [Shimiao] standing beside, jumped up on a nearby stool, delivered a flying kick to knock down a thug, and then coolly tossed the backpack aside.
0:59:41|0:59:45|Shimiao's eyes were filled with killing intent as she unzipped her coat.
0:59:51|1:0:1|Several hooligans rushed towards [Shifen] and the lone [Shimiao], [Shimiao] showed amazing fighting skills, knocking down the hooligans one by one.
1:0:6|1:0:32|The three of them cooperated tacitly, cornering a burly thug. At this moment, the police suddenly arrived. [Miao Miaomiao] dragged [Shifen] and the other two away, leaving [Shimiao] and several thugs behind, who were clueless. [Shimiao] looked around in confusion, and the police pointed at [Shimiao], pausing when they saw the words on [Shimiao]'s clothes.
1:0:42|1:0:57|Shimiao squatted down, holding her head, and when she turned her head, she saw Shifen. Shifen sneaked back and squatted next to Shimiao, raising her eyebrows at her. Later, several people were taken to the police station, a few hooligans squatted in a row, Miao Miaomiao and Shifen squatted across from them.
1:0:57|1:1:6|[Shimiao] stared fiercely at the group of people in front of her, and the thugs also stared back at [Shimiao] without backing down. When [Shifen] saw the police walking in, she immediately straightened up.
1:1:10|1:1:34|Shimiao smiled at the praise from the police uncle, but was startled by his sudden loud reprimand, which scared off a few young delinquents across the street. The police uncle then dragged a chair over to the desk and sat in front of Shifen and Shimiao, asking sternly. Shimiao hesitated for a moment before speaking. Shimiao glanced at Shifen.
1:1:59|1:2:17|The two immediately panicked, blaming each other. The police simply handed the phone to [Shimiao], who took it with tears in her eyes and looked to [Shifen] for help. However, [Shifen] helplessly furrowed his brow. [Shimiao] knew there was no choice but to compromise, so she dialed the number, but no one answered.
1:2:57|1:3:5|[Shimiao] was confused by the words, unable to distinguish between truth and falsehood for a moment. [Shifen] became more and more excited as she spoke, choking up.
1:3:16|1:3:22|[Shifen] looked at [Shimiao] with red eyes, while [Shimiao] looked at him in shock, immersed in his words.
1:3:42|1:4:1|And so, [Shifen] and [Shimiao] successfully left the police station. The two of them walked back slowly in the night. [Shimiao] suddenly stopped, and [Shifen] looked at her in confusion, reaching out to pat her head. It was then that [Shimiao] snapped out of it, giving [Shifen] a punch with a smile.
1:4:12|1:4:19|Shimiao hadn't finished speaking when Shifen immediately changed the subject, interrupting her and speeding up to run ahead.
1:4:20|1:4:36|The two walked around a corner, and [Shifen] jumped up to pat the light bulb hanging on the wall. The light flickered on [Shimiao]'s face, bringing her back to childhood memories. [Shifen] stood on the stairs at this corner, holding a blade of grass, crying sadly.
1:5:1|1:5:26|Shimiao picked up the ice cream with tears in her eyes and ate it without any hesitation. Then she looked up at [Shifen] with a smile through her tears. [Shimiao] shook her head, returning to reality. [Shifen] took the lead up the stairs, walking along the roadside with arms outstretched. [Shimiao] ran to catch up. Looking ahead at the tunnel, [Shifen] asked [Shimiao] with a lowered head, and [Shimiao] replied.
1:6:42|1:7:7|[Shifen] crazily applied makeup to [Shimiao], who nodded affirmatively to [Miao Miaomiao]. After hesitating for a moment, [Shimiao] nodded in agreement. [Shifen] and [Miao Miaomiao] playfully ran down the stairs and returned home. [Shifen] came out with a pot and placed it on the dining table.
1:7:37|1:7:46|On the side, [Shimiao] was very supportive, scooping up a lot into her own bowl with a spoon. To the astonishment of both, she voraciously dug into [Shifen]'s dark cuisine.
1:8:24|1:8:38|The drunken father started to act crazy, and [Shifen] quickly went up to cover his mouth, afraid of being heard by [Miao Miaomiao]. Meanwhile, [Miao Miaomiao] and [Shimiao] were in the bedroom, with [Shimiao] holding a cheering light stick and staring blankly.
1:8:52|1:9:8|Shimiao was startled by Miao Miaomiao and let out a burp, widening her eyes. At this moment, Shifen and his father were chatting on the street, with his father sitting at the front of the car drinking. His father couldn't help but ask,
1:9:34|1:9:49|The father and son both had red eyes and fell silent. [Shimiao], who was hiding in the dark, also showed a look of sadness. Afterwards, she left [Miao Miaomiao]'s house and returned home with a heavy heart. She never expected that [Shifen], who seemed carefree in her memory, had so many hidden worries.
1:9:49|1:10:0|The next day, [Shimiao] was walking to school when she suddenly ran into the sneaky [Miao Miaomiao]. [Miao Miaomiao] emerged from the corner, and [Shimiao] asked in surprise,
1:10:17|1:10:33|[Shimiao] started to search for [Shifen]'s whereabouts in order to help [Miao Miaomiao]. She went to a street stall and saw boys in school uniforms, approaching them to confirm if they were [Shifen]. She didn't miss any opportunity, even checking the arcade machines and fruit shops one by one, in search of [Shifen]'s figure.
1:10:33|1:10:39|And at this moment, [Shifen] was sitting in a mahjong parlor, engrossed in playing mobile games on her phone, completely forgetting everything else.
1:10:40|1:10:46|Shimiao walked by and saw Shifen from the side. She immediately stormed in with a frown on her face and questioned,
1:11:2|1:11:14|Shimiao turned and left as she spoke, Shifen immediately panicked. She hurriedly caught up and whispered as she looked around,
1:11:26|1:11:32|[Shifen] carefully picked up the grilled sausage, [Shimiao] shook her head,
1:12:12|1:12:32|It turns out that [Shifen] had misunderstood before. It wasn't the case that Dad had gone out at that time, but [Shifen] had actually carried his drunken father back home in advance, hiding him under the blanket to create the illusion of Dad not being at home.
1:12:41|1:12:49|Shifen thought for a moment and smiled helplessly, saying
1:13:37|1:14:0|[Miao Miaomiao] snatched two sausages, handed one to [Shimiao], who took it, but [Shifen] bit off the other sausage in [Miao Miaomiao]'s hand and ran away. Enraged, [Miao Miaomiao] chased after [Shifen], shouting, while [Shifen] deliberately spun around in place, teasing [Miao Miaomiao] with the sausage in its mouth.
1:14:0|1:14:8|Miao Miaomiao was about to catch up, but immediately turned around and ran away. Shimiao, on the other hand, followed behind the two with a dejected look, holding a sausage in her hand and staring into space.
1:14:8|1:14:23|She walked to a familiar intersection, looked up at the two-story pedestrian bridge, and suddenly recalled the memory of [Shimiao] hiding next to the railing of the bridge, playing hide-and-seek with [Shifen]. She waited for a long time but [Shifen] did not show up, so she got up to look for her.
1:14:23|1:14:49|She passed by a roadside stall and went straight to the arcade machine on the side of the road. There, [Shifen] was sitting in front of the machine, playing the airplane shooting game frantically. [Shimiao] gritted her teeth as she watched [Shifen], who had a provocative expression on his face. The scene shifted to the school, where [Miao Miaomiao] was walking alone on the campus. [Shifen] walked with his hands in his pockets behind her, and he caught a glimpse of [Miao Miaomiao]'s back. He immediately straightened up and cautiously approached [Miao Miaomiao].
1:14:49|1:15:5|He skillfully patted his sister's right shoulder, then took a bite of her sausage from the left side. As they locked eyes, [Shifen] realized that the person in front of her was [Shimiao], and the atmosphere became awkward. [Shifen] took the sausage out of her mouth and slowly put it back on the skewer.
1:16:7|1:16:15|Shimiao nodded after some thought.
1:16:34|1:16:50|At that moment, [Miao Miaomiao] walked into the classroom humming a song. The conversation between [Shimiao] and [Wan Xing] came to a sudden halt as they both looked at [Miao Miaomiao]. She walked to her seat, picked up her backpack, waved to [Shimiao] and [Wan Xing], then turned and left.
1:16:59|1:17:20|[Shimiao] fell into contemplation, she didn't know if she was worried about [Miao Miaomiao] or missing [Shifen]. [Shimiao] turned her eyes and suddenly saw [Shifen] passing by outside the window. [Shifen] was walking on the road just fine, then suddenly looked terrified, rushed to the corner of the wall in panic. Seeing this, [Shimiao] walked to the window in confusion, secretly observing [Shifen]'s strange behavior.
1:17:21|1:17:30|Miao Miaomiao appeared in Shimiao's sight, focusing on playing with her phone. Shifen quickly ran up the stairs, hiding in a corner waiting for Miao Miaomiao to leave.
1:17:30|1:17:55|Miao Miaomiao completely ignored Shifen and walked straight ahead. Shifen immediately got up and ran in the opposite direction. Shimiao, seeing this, picked up her backpack, and directly climbed out of the classroom window on the first floor. Shifen's strange behavior aroused suspicion from Shimiao, who quickly grabbed her backpack and followed her. She followed Shifen out of the campus, unaware of the tail behind her, walking briskly ahead.
1:17:55|1:17:58|He did not walk towards home, but took a unfamiliar route.
1:18:1|1:18:27|Passing through an intersection, [Miao Miaomiao] saw a poster of her idol concert on the roadside. [Shifen] stopped to take a look, then continued walking forward. Unbeknownst to him, [Shimiao] had been following him all along. As they reached the bottom of a building, [Miao Miaomiao]'s mother was standing by the road. Seeing this, [Shifen] walked up to her. The mother, as if waiting for a long time, shouted coldly,
1:18:27|1:18:36|The mother came to her senses and looked behind [Shifen].
1:18:46|1:18:54|The mother fell into silence, not knowing how to respond. After a moment of contemplation, she asked,
1:19:25|1:19:33|[Shifen] A series of questions made [Shimiao], who was hiding in the corner, shocked. She immediately turned around, hopped on her electric bike, and rushed to [Miao Miaomiao]'s house without hesitation.
1:19:34|1:19:48|At this moment, [Miao Miaomiao] is choosing her outfit in the bedroom, standing in front of the mirror and twisting around. [Shimiao] rushes all the way and arrives just in time as [Miao Miaomiao] is about to leave.
1:20:24|1:20:29|Miao Miaomiao turned away angrily, and Shimiao stepped forward to snatch the lantern from Miao Miaomiao's hand.
1:20:50|1:20:56|[Miao Miaomiao] angrily kicked [Shimiao], tears swirling in her eyes. [Shimiao] stood there in a daze.
1:21:24|1:21:40|After saying that, she left without looking back, while [Shifen] kept watching them from a distance. [Miao Miaomiao] ignored the presence of [Shifen], who looked at the departing [Miao Miaomiao] and walked over helplessly. [Shimiao] stood in place with moist eyes, not understanding what she had done wrong.
1:21:41|1:21:46|[Shifen] walked straight to the roadside, picked up the sign on the ground, and dusted it off.
1:21:47|1:21:56|He ignored Shimiao and chased after Miaomiao with the lantern in hand. That night, Shimiao sulkily pushed around the steak on the plate.
1:22:52|1:23:0|Dad and Mom both froze, shocked, and looked at each other. Dad put down his fork and said with a hint of reproach,
1:23:21|1:23:30|The two of them froze again. The mother dropped the knife and fork in her hand, looked at the father in confusion, and [Shimiao] sighed.
1:24:18|1:24:40|Mom shook her head with red eyes, [Shimiao] recalled every moment with [Shifen], stood up resolutely and left. Dad shouted behind her, but [Shimiao] walked away without looking back, wiping tears as she left the restaurant.
1:24:40|1:25:7|At this moment, [Miao Miaomiao] is sleeping soundly at home with headphones on, while [Shifen] is quietly packing his belongings next to her. He carefully places his beloved figurines from the shelf into a cardboard box, then takes out a piece of paper with a transfer application written on it. The reason stated is that his parents are divorcing and he needs to move back to his father's hometown. After staring at the transfer application for a long time, [Shifen] silently moves the packed items to the table by the door.
1:25:7|1:25:36|At this moment, [Shimiao] is walking on the street, feeling low. The street lights are on as she passes rows of shops and roadside stalls with her head down. When she looks up, she meets [Shifen] who is slowly walking towards her carrying a cardboard box. [Shifen] stops at the entrance of a shop, sees [Shimiao] approaching, and smiles. Placing the box on the shop's table, [Shifen] takes something out while saying to [Shimiao],
1:25:40|1:25:45|[Shimiao] said, [Shimiao] raised her head and turned her eyes to ask,
1:26:10|1:26:19|Shimiao came to her senses, looked at the things cherished by Shifen in front of her, widened her eyes and asked,
1:27:5|1:27:23|[Shifen] lowered her head in silence, calmed her emotions, and then answered casually. [Shimiao] widened her eyes in disbelief and couldn't say a word. Then the two of them walked towards home.
1:27:43|1:27:49|He patted [Shimiao]'s head, pretending to smile casually. [Shimiao] took a step and turned to go up the stairs.
1:27:49|1:28:1|[Shifen] stood in place and watched as [Shimiao] walked away. As she continued walking, [Shimiao] slowed down her pace, unable to resist stopping and turning her head to take a glance, only to find the intersection empty.
1:28:1|1:28:25|She walked downstairs, habitually took out her phone to use as a flashlight. Suddenly, she saw a beam of light shining from the side, only to see [Shifen] standing on the overpass, using a flashlight to light up [Shimiao]. [Shifen] raised the flashlight and grinned, while [Shimiao] turned and went up the stairs. The steps became clear under the light, and [Shimiao] walked up step by step, looking back at [Shifen].
1:28:25|1:28:34|[Shifen] followed [Shimiao]'s figure with the light in her hand, accompanying [Shimiao] up the stairs layer by layer, until [Shimiao] returned home.
1:28:35|1:28:45|[Shimiao] stood on the rooftop of the house, stretched her head down to look for [Shifen]'s figure. After realizing that [Shifen] was no longer there, [Shimiao] turned around in disappointment and left.
1:28:45|1:28:58|She came to the other end of the rooftop, looking around boredly. In the center of the rooftop, there was a swing, with green plants placed next to the railing, looking especially beautiful in the quiet night.
1:28:58|1:29:21|[Shimiao] sat on the swing with a lonely expression. She looked around at the night scene, called [Wan Xing], who responded quickly. After a pause, [Shimiao] looked up at the sky and said after a moment of thought,
1:29:23|1:29:34|On the other end of the phone, [Wan Xing] hung up and turned to look at [Wan Sui] who was lounging on the sofa with his legs crossed, watching TV. He seemed to have seen something amusing as he burst into laughter.
1:30:12|1:30:17|Shimiao was stunned, slowly raised her head to look at Miao Miaomiao. Wan Xing then stuck a post-it note again.
1:30:17|1:30:48|Shimiao turned her head and glared fiercely at Wan Xing after watching. After class, Shimiao stood in the corridor with two bottles of drinks, waiting for something. A poster on the roadside advertised an event where rare cards could be caught in a real-life doll machine at the mall. Shimiao then went to the mall, where she was slowly lowered while hanging in the air. When she reached the ground, she anxiously picked up a snack bag from the floor, imitated Shifen's actions by shaking it near her ear, listening for the sound of the rare card.
1:30:48|1:31:7|She picked up one pack after another, while Kaixin waited happily on the sidelines for the staff to find Shimiao. When the round ended and Shimiao hadn't found the rare card, she was unwilling to give up and lined up again. Kaixin tentatively asked,
1:31:18|1:31:21|Shimiao's face was pale, with sweat sticking her disheveled hair to her cheeks.
1:31:21|1:31:30|After she finished speaking, she turned to look at the team ahead, unwilling to rest for a moment. [Kaixin] looked at [Shimiao] with concern, then took off her own coat.
1:31:31|1:31:35|He squatted down and tied the coat around [Shimiao]'s waist, saying,
1:31:38|1:31:43|Shimiao glanced at the coat around her waist, then looked up at Zhen Kaixin, finally revealing a slight smile.
1:31:44|1:31:49|It's [Shimiao]'s turn to go on stage. She dives into the pile of snacks, shaking each one next to her ear.
1:32:18|1:32:29|[Zhen Kaixin] hurriedly lifted [Shimiao] up, and [Shimiao] excitedly danced in the air. She couldn't wait to unwrap the package, only to find a piece of puzzle fragment instead of a rare card.
1:32:29|1:32:40|[Shimiao] couldn't believe what she saw, she shook the bag desperately, but there was nothing left. On the sidelines, [Zhen Kaixin] watched [Shimiao], realizing she didn't catch anything, and the smile on her face gradually disappeared.
1:32:40|1:32:45|Shimiao landed, and the staff came forward to take the bag, saying,
1:32:51|1:33:16|Applause erupted from the sidelines. [Shimiao] snapped out of it, looking incredulously at the rare card in the staff's hand. Before she could react, [Zhen Kaixin] walked over, lifted [Shimiao] up in a bear hug, and handed her the rare card. The two then left together. The staff shouted, but [Kaixin] left without looking back, carrying [Shimiao] with one arm around her neck.
1:33:16|1:33:35|With a rare card in her hand, she stared at [Kaixin], her eyes shining brightly. For a moment, she was lost in thought. At this moment, [Kaixin] seemed like a hero, saving the experienced [Shimiao] from danger. The scene then shifted to [Miao Miaomiao]'s bedroom, where [Shimiao] was holding the rare card, smiling foolishly.
1:33:57|1:34:6|Miao Miaomiao's eyes turned red in an instant, and she choked up, unable to speak clearly.
1:34:17|1:34:25|Shimiao blurted out these words in a moment of impatience, Miaomiao remained silent with her head down. Shimiao realized and wanted to explain afterwards.
1:34:57|1:35:20|After opening up to each other, the two smiled at each other. The sunlight streamed into the room, shining on the photo of [Shifen] on the table. After returning home, [Shimiao] opened the calendar and calculated the date. She circled the 9th lunar month, then quickly found her next lunar birthday date. Using a watercolor pen, she wrote the word "birthday" in the blank space, and then fell into contemplation.
1:35:20|1:35:42|Outside the window, the sound of a horn suddenly rang out. [Shimiao] snapped out of her daze, placed the watercolor brush on the coffee table, and walked out of the room to the edge of the rooftop. Peering out, she saw [Shifen] wearing a denim jacket and a helmet, riding a brand new electric bike. [Shifen] waved at [Shimiao], who smiled back, then turned and went downstairs. [Shifen] slowly reversed the electric bike to the stairwell, waiting for [Shimiao].
1:35:42|1:35:49|Shimiao ran down the stairs with a look of surprise on her face, while Shifen sat in a chair twisting around, showing off her new electric car.
1:35:49|1:36:11|[Shimiao] suddenly remembered the day of her birthday, when [Shifen] also flaunted her new car in front of her. She couldn't help but feel distracted, with a vacant expression on her face. After a moment of contemplation, [Shimiao] spoke.
1:36:16|1:36:22|[Shifen] raised an eyebrow at [Shimiao],
1:36:52|1:36:55|Shimiao, as she spoke, tears welled up in her eyes.
1:37:24|1:37:38|But she couldn't say it. She didn't know how to respond, just staring at [Shifen]. [Shifen] was startled, her expression gradually becoming serious.
1:37:38|1:38:4|The sky gradually darkened, with [Shifen] riding an electric bike and [Shimiao] sitting behind him. They were ready to help [Shimiao] find her lost brother. Passing through a dim alley and over a footbridge, they arrived near the ship restaurant. [Shifen] looked up at the ship, parked the bike on the side, and [Shimiao] took off her helmet. They walked up the deck along the steps. Perhaps because it was night, there were not many customers on the ship.
1:38:4|1:38:19|The waiter was busy clearing the dining table, while [Shifen] and [Shimiao] wandered around the boat on their own. [Shifen] stopped, looked down in disbelief, and asked, leaving [Shimiao] momentarily speechless, unsure how to explain to [Shifen], and could only nod.
1:38:21|1:38:28|The two walked into the cabin, the restaurant was empty, the tables were all cleaned up, only a few dim lights were still on.
1:38:59|1:39:5|Her tears couldn't help but fall, and [Shimiao] reached out to wipe them away.
1:39:34|1:39:48|[Shifen] suddenly looked up and glanced at the clock beside her, quickly saying, "[Shifen], push [Shimiao] onto the table and turn on the virtual candle on the phone."
1:40:16|1:40:34|[Shimiao] blew out the candle, and the lights on the boat went out at the same time. Suddenly, a huge wheel-shaped moon appeared in the night sky, slowly passing through the city. Unable to find her brother, [Shimiao] fell into despair. The two of them had to ride the electric bike back the same way, with [Shifen] trying to make [Shimiao] laugh along the way.
1:40:34|1:40:39|When passing over a speed bump, [Shifen] habitually reaches out to hold onto [Shimiao] behind her.
1:40:39|1:40:45|Shimiao looked up at Shifen with tears in her eyes, not knowing that Shifen was also feeling the same way.
1:40:45|1:40:51|At Shimiao's home downstairs, Shimiao took off the helmet and handed it to Shifen.
1:41:12|1:41:36|[Shimiao] twisted his arm, making [Shifen] wince in pain. [Shifen] opened his mouth wide, patted [Shimiao] with his other hand as a sign of surrender. [Shimiao] released his grip, placed the helmet on the back seat of the electric bike, nodded at [Shifen]. Despite [Shifen] trying to force a smile, [Shimiao] could only awkwardly smile back before quickly turning away.
1:41:38|1:41:56|She walked to the stairs, and the broken voice-activated light above suddenly lit up. Although she found it strange, she did not suspect anything and slowly walked up the stairs. Just as she took two steps, she seemed to remember something, turned around and looked at [Shifen]. [Shifen] was still standing in place, smiling foolishly. After a moment of thought, [Shimiao] said,
1:41:58|1:42:20|[Shifen] immediately nodded obediently, keeping a smile as she looked at [Shimiao]. After [Shimiao] finished speaking, she awkwardly turned around and ran up the stairs. The voice-activated lights on the second floor lit up accordingly. Suddenly, [Shimiao] popped her head out, and [Shifen] also looked up at her. [Shifen] continued to smile and waved at [Shimiao], who waved back reluctantly.
1:42:21|1:42:28|Shimiao returned home, but Uncle Hu suddenly appeared, and Mom walked over.
1:43:5|1:43:29|After turning on the light, [Shimiao] found that [Shifen]'s room had miraculously returned, but only the furniture remained, all the items were gone. Looking around, [Shimiao] saw the familiar bed and table, as well as the small sofa by the window. She looked up and saw the basketball net on the wall. She hurried to open the cabinet and found that [Shifen]'s towel was also missing.
1:43:29|1:43:42|She then opened the wardrobe and found a small note stuck on the clothes rail. She moved aside the hangers and took the note down, which read, "My darling, I've taken everything with me, not leaving a single thing for you."
1:43:42|1:44:2|Shimiao then came to the bedside in the bedroom and found several large characters on the wall, saying "Cowards have to rely on themselves in the future," with a big arrow at the end pointing to a rope. There were also a few messages posted at the head of the bed, saying "Stop at the red light," "Eat less spicy food and more vegetables."
1:44:2|1:44:12|"Do not believe what boys say," "Violence cannot solve problems." There is also an electric bike key on the table, with a card next to it that reads:
1:44:12|1:44:21|"Sister, happy 17th birthday," [Shimiao] picked up the rope, gently pulled it, and the light went out. Pulling it again, it lit up.
1:44:21|1:44:40|[Shimiao] repeated this action, her eyes gradually moistening, the figure of [Shifen] appearing in her mind. The scene shifted back to a moment ago, with [Shifen] standing by [Shimiao]'s bed, everything prepared perfectly. She looked at her masterpiece with satisfaction, feeling she could leave with peace of mind.
1:44:40|1:44:56|He lay on [Shimiao]'s bed, trying the pull switch he had modified. As the lights flickered on and off, time rewound to the present moment. [Shimiao] kept pulling the rope, tears shimmering in his eyes, sadness evident on his face.
1:44:56|1:45:6|The scene cuts back to daytime, with [Shifen] standing on a ladder repairing the voice-controlled lights in the hallway. After fixing it, he smiles with satisfaction and leaves contentedly.
1:45:6|1:45:33|[Shimiao] was immersed in memories and couldn't help but cry while pulling the light string. When the light turned on, [Shimiao] lowered her head, unable to control herself any longer. Tears slowly fell from the corners of her eyes, and then [Shimiao] couldn't hold back anymore. She turned around and ran out frantically. Seeing this, her mother hurriedly shouted, and [Shimiao] quickly rushed out of the room, closed the door, ran down the stairs, and rode away on an electric bike.
1:45:34|1:45:42|The scene shifts back to a month ago, the night when Mom and Uncle Hu took [Shifen] out for dinner.
1:46:24|1:46:32|Mom lowered her head and couldn't speak, Uncle Hu also adjusted his glasses, [Shifen] said firmly,
1:46:48|1:46:58|Uncle Hu's eyes were also red, patting Mom's back soothingly. At this moment, [Shimiao] was driving an electric bike rapidly on the road.
1:47:54|1:48:16|[Miao Miaomiao] was driving on the road, tears uncontrollably streaming down her face. She had always thought that [Shifen] was petty, selfish, and carefree, only knowing how to tease her brother. It wasn't until she discovered the secret hidden in [Shifen]'s heart and he disappeared from her life one after another, that [Shimiao] realized how good her brother really was.
1:48:16|1:48:23|In front of the dining table, [Shifen] paused for a moment, then continued,
1:48:25|1:48:39|[Shifen] kept staring at her mother with a silly smile after speaking, tears shimmering in her eyes. Feeling deeply guilty, her mother lowered her head, covering her mouth with her hand as tears streamed down her face.
1:49:4|1:49:31|[Shimiao] pointed at the passing electric car and asked her brother, then the two ran hand in hand on the steps, opening their arms and laughing happily. The scene at that moment was so beautiful, even the flying strands of hair carried joy. Sunlight spilled on the pillars in the living room, where the siblings' growth was recorded with chalk. Finally, [Shimiao] arrived at the train station. Even in the late night, it was still bustling with people.
1:49:31|1:49:36|Shimiao parked the electric bike next to the stall at the entrance and ran towards the lobby.
1:49:41|1:49:58|Shimiao arrived at the platform, running and looking for Shifen's figure. The platform was crowded with passengers carrying bags of all sizes, waiting for the approaching train. A train passed in front of Shimiao, and then she saw Shifen on the other side of the tracks.
1:49:59|1:50:21|[Shimiao] excitedly shouted, while [Shifen] was packing her luggage with her back towards her. He couldn't believe his ears, slowly turned his head, and looked at [Shimiao] in shock. [Shimiao] shouted again, and [Shifen] turned around to look at the several large bags behind her, but found nothing unusual. She then turned around, took off the backpack behind her, and said,
1:50:33|1:50:55|Shimiao cried out, tears streaming down her face, while Shifen stood frozen in place, his mouth twitching. The siblings locked eyes, conveying their reluctance to part through silent tears. Shifen's tears fell like beads off a broken string, continuously dropping. After a long while, he slowly lowered his raised arm, unable to speak through his sobs.
1:50:55|1:51:1|He wanted to face Shimiao as usual, with tears streaming down his face and a big smile.
1:51:1|1:51:11|The clock next to the station chimed, reminding everyone that the train was about to arrive. [Shimiao] looked up and realized it was almost 12 o'clock.
1:51:11|1:51:26|She suddenly realized, hurriedly took out her phone, opened the virtual candle, solemnly made a wish, [Shimiao] stared at [Shifen] opposite, shed a tear, and finally blew out the candle when the clock struck.
1:51:26|1:51:42|The film is about to say goodbye to you here. Thank you for listening. The end of the film will bring you a post-credits scene.
1:52:16|1:52:27|In this post-credits scene, two mall employees are lying in a pile of snacks. One of them says:
1:52:27|1:52:34|The monster doll on the side also joined in, indicating that it should also have a share.
