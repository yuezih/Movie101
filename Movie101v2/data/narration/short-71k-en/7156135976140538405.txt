0:0:49|0:0:53|In the beautiful mountain environment, the sound of a horn echoed through every corner of the village.
0:1:40|0:1:55|The village echoed with the sound of the horn, [Yang Yinghua] wearing a straw hat, stood by the terraced fields filled with water, waving his hands to throw the seedlings into the terraced fields. Then he walked into the pond, bent down, and skillfully planted the seedlings neatly in the mud and water.
0:1:57|0:2:9|Suddenly, a bird's chirping echoed through the terraced fields. Accompanied by a man's singing, a phoenix bird flapped its wings and flew over from above the terraced fields, its sharp cry causing [Yang Yinghua] to look up from the terraced fields.
0:2:12|0:2:22|In the sky covered by dark clouds for thousands of miles, a colorful phoenix soared with its wings spread out. The scene moved until it flew to overlap with the sun, then slowly disappeared.
0:2:22|0:2:30|Next to the terraced fields, there were several towering trees, forming a beautiful picture with [Yang Yinghua] who was working in the terraced fields.
0:2:30|0:2:38|[Yang Yinghua]'s wife [Ma Mei] slowly walks over with a little girl, and at this moment, the name of the film appears on the screen - Eighteen Buildings Village.
0:2:38|0:2:57|[Yang Yinghua] saw his wife approaching, so he put down what he was doing and walked forward. He wiped his hands on his pants, then squatted down to pick up the little girl. He used his hands to wipe the girl's runny nose. [Ma Mei], who was standing beside him, took off the basket on her back, lifted the cloth covering it, shook it to the side, and then spread it on the ground.
0:2:57|0:3:2|Then, one by one, the meals were carried out from the stele tower and placed on the prepared cloth.
0:3:2|0:3:8|[Yang Yinghua] picked up the little girl, handed her to his wife, and then picked up the food on the ground to start eating.
0:3:8|0:3:14|He took a bite of chili and rice, then turned his head to the other side as if he had something on his mind, gazing at the American side.
0:3:16|0:3:25|Elsewhere, a man is beating a large drum in front of him, accompanied by a group of middle-aged women in ethnic costumes dancing and drumming along.
0:3:25|0:3:28|The scene shifts, a car drives through a tunnel.
0:3:28|0:3:37|Driving past Highway No. 1, they arrived at a large bridge spanning two mountains, and finally slowly drove along the winding path.
0:3:37|0:3:57|In a bustling market, a man with braids wandered aimlessly through the crowd. A small truck honked wildly as it passed by, catching the attention of the man with braids. He looked uncertainly at the two people inside the truck, but before he could say anything, the truck started up and drove away. The man with braids turned around.
0:3:57|0:4:4|Gazing in the direction the truck left, after a moment, he seemed to realize something and quickly turned his head and ran towards home.
0:4:5|0:4:12|On the winding and rugged mountain road, a three-wheeled electric vehicle is driving, with Dumb Brother standing in the back of the vehicle looking out.
0:4:12|0:4:24|At this moment, the car behind drove directly past, splashing dust onto Braided Man's face. He raised his hand in disgust and waved it away, while the small car continued to move along the narrow mountain road.
0:4:26|0:4:40|In front, a pile of stones blocked the passing vehicles, forcing a sedan to stop. A man wearing glasses got out of the car, walked up to inspect the road conditions, and then asked an old man herding cattle passing by.
0:4:49|0:4:58|The man in glasses was incredulous for a moment, then looked towards the direction the old man had left in, mouth agape in surprise, before finally turning his head in resignation and walking towards the stone blocking the way.
0:4:59|0:5:4|On another overgrown hill, a pig was running around in the bushes.
0:5:4|0:5:9|Not far away, [Yang Yinghua] and [Yang Lan] were searching for the lost pig with determined expressions on their faces.
0:5:9|0:5:15|At this moment, the pig accidentally ran to the edge of the cliff and fell down, emitting a tragic scream.
0:5:15|0:5:19|The two of them heard a noise and screamed as they ran towards the edge of the cliff.
0:5:19|0:5:22|After arriving, the two of them leaned over to look down the cliff.
0:5:22|0:5:29|In the moment when [Yang Yinghua] was in a daze, the old man took off the hat made of a long cloth strip on his head and untied it, wrapping it around his waist.
0:5:31|0:5:50|The old man handed the other end of the long cloth strip to the young man without saying a word, then he climbed down the cliff directly. [Yang Yinghua] was pulling the long cloth strip from above, his face showing a fierce and terrified expression, eyes tightly closed in fear, but still holding onto the long cloth strip handed to him by the old man. After rescuing the pig, the two of them went straight back to the village.
0:5:51|0:6:6|On the other side, the man with glasses walked into the village with a large bag on his back. The people washing clothes at the village entrance looked at him curiously, but he didn't stop. He walked up the stairs quickly, and the woman washing clothes greeted him when she saw him.
0:6:6|0:6:13|The old man in the village led the cow down the stairs, the man with glasses stepped aside to make way for the old man, and then walked towards the village.
0:6:14|0:6:21|The scene cuts to Ma Mei riding a tricycle to the village entrance, where they are blocked by rocks and unable to proceed.
0:6:21|0:6:30|He then leaped off the car with one swift movement, took a few steps, glanced at the small sedan parked in front of him, and then ran towards the village without looking back.
0:6:30|0:6:42|The man with glasses arrived at the village committee of Building 18, where many tied-up quilts were hanging on the house. He looked up at the environment inside the house, and at that moment, a villager came over to greet him.
0:7:17|0:7:21|On the other side, the man with braids shouted loudly in the village.
0:7:21|0:7:27|With his shouting, a crowd also gathered behind him.
0:7:37|0:7:41|The man with braids led the crowd, step by step, towards the highest point in the village.
0:7:41|0:7:47|After walking for a while, he and the people behind him quickened their pace, taking big steps up the stairs.
0:7:54|0:8:1|The two in the room were tying up the pig they had just rescued from the cliff, when they heard someone calling their English League song, they got up and walked towards the door.
0:8:10|0:8:19|[Yang Yinghua] frowned after listening, then pulled out a sickle from the side firewood and ran out.
0:8:19|0:8:25|In the house, after finishing tying the beads, [Yang Lan] came out and saw this scene, eyes wide open in disbelief.
0:8:31|0:8:37|The man with braids chased after [Yang Yinghua] to a corner, where he met [Ma Mei] who had just finished delivering food to her husband.
0:8:37|0:8:48|After listening to the words of the man with braids, she immediately picked up the little girl next to her and ran towards her husband.
0:8:48|0:8:51|[Yang Yingjun] immediately dropped the door curtain and ran outside.
0:8:51|0:8:54|People in the neighborhood committee heard the shouting and quickly ran out.
0:8:59|0:9:7|[Dumb Brother] ran with a sickle held high in his hand, while the villagers chased after him along the village road.
0:9:7|0:9:12|[Yang Yinghua], who rushed over from the field, met Dumb Brother at a bend and grabbed his wrist holding the sickle.
0:9:31|0:9:43|After speaking, [Yang Yinghua] pulled Dumb Brother away, and the male teacher who had just been saved by Dumb Brother immediately fainted in the crowd.
0:9:43|0:9:46|[Yang Yinghua] and Dumb Brother rode a tricycle to the market.
0:10:5|0:10:10|Yang Weiwei heard the shouting, turned her head to look at the newcomer, and immediately spoke to the man beside her.
0:10:26|0:10:32|Ling Lian Ge quickly walked towards the two, picked up something nearby, and smashed it towards the person on the right.
0:10:32|0:10:36|Daughter Yang Weiwei squeezed from behind and couldn't put an end to this farce.
0:11:2|0:11:8|Ma Mei first pointed at Shi Youcheng across the street, then gestured something in sign language.
0:11:8|0:11:12|The police were puzzled on the side, then turned to [Yang Yinghua] sitting next to them and asked.
0:11:53|0:11:57|[Yang Yinghua] warned Dumb Brother and then reached out to wipe his forehead.
0:12:20|0:12:30|The police officers shook their heads slightly upon hearing this. Shi Youcheng handed the money to Xiao Weiwei and then tugged at her arm, indicating for her to give it to Brother Yinglian.
0:12:30|0:12:37|Yang Weiwei slowly got up from her seat and walked to her father's side, then handed him the money.
0:13:27|0:13:34|After [Weiwei] finished speaking, she bowed to her father and [Yang Yinghua], then was pulled away by Shi Youcheng.
0:13:34|0:13:38|With tears in his eyes, Ma Mei and [Yang Yinghua] sat silently in their seats as requested by Brother Lin.
0:13:39|0:13:43|They both got on the open-air tricycle back to the village.
0:13:43|0:13:47|After returning home, [Ma Mei] sat at the dining table and advised Yingling Brother.
0:14:10|0:14:16|Elian Ge couldn't help but choke up as he listened to [Ma Mei], then wiped away his tears with his sleeve.
0:14:16|0:14:21|[Yang Yingjun] sat silently on the side, then picked up the glass of water on the table and took a sip.
0:14:23|0:14:28|The little girl is riding a plastic pony near the door.
0:14:28|0:14:33|At this moment, the man with braids leisurely walks into the room from outside.
0:14:33|0:14:37|He carefully pulled out the chair at the dining table and sat down.
0:14:37|0:14:46|Looking at the three silent figures, he nervously rubbed his hands together between his legs and then spoke.
0:14:47|0:14:48|[Yang Yinghua] started to criticize him.
0:15:7|0:15:11|The man with braids looked at the three people at the dining table, then said to [Ma Mei].
0:15:15|0:15:21|[Ma Mei] got up and walked towards the kitchen after hearing that, the man with braids looked at her back and spoke.
0:15:23|0:15:29|Before long, [Ma Mei] handed her a pair of chopsticks and then used a bowl to ladle soup for her.
0:15:29|0:15:33|The man with braids picked up the chopsticks and said to Brother Yinglian and [Yang Yingjun].
0:15:36|0:15:42|After speaking, the man with braids picked up the chopsticks and started eating, then he spoke.
0:15:46|0:15:50|[Yang Yingjun] shouted loudly after hearing these words.
0:15:50|0:15:55|After [Yang Yingjun] finished speaking, the dining table fell into silence.
0:16:49|0:16:53|Braided Man mentioned the atmosphere was off, threw the chopsticks and turned his head to the side.
0:16:53|0:16:57|Ma Mei quickly came out to mediate the situation when she saw this scene.
0:16:57|0:17:5|At night, [Yang Yinghua] alone entered a room, using his hands to push aside the wheat in front of him, revealing a porcelain vessel containing something.
0:17:6|0:17:12|He then lifted the porcelain with one hand, while holding onto the ladder with the other, slowly descending from the second floor.
0:17:12|0:17:22|[Yang Yingjun] sat down on a chair, then he opened the lid of the porcelain in his arms, took out something wrapped in cloth from inside, and placed the porcelain on the side of the chair.
0:17:22|0:17:27|He then opened the cloth, removed the cards and certificates on top, and picked up the one at the bottom.
0:17:28|0:17:45|Daughter's graduation certificate, with a few hundred yuan bills tucked inside. [Yang Yinghua] held the bills in his hand, gazing at his daughter's photo on the certificate. He then folded the certificate neatly, smoothed out the bills in his hand and placed them on his lap, before taking out more money from his shirt pocket.
0:17:45|0:17:55|Putting the one hundred yuan bill that her daughter gave her during the day together with the previous one hundred yuan bill, she then neatly arranged the remaining change and put it together with the one hundred yuan bill.
0:17:56|0:18:3|He was sorting out the banknotes while choking back tears. Unable to hold it in any longer, he burst into tears.
0:18:3|0:18:14|After a while, [Yang Yinghua] finished organizing the money, put everything back into the porcelain jar, then climbed to the second floor and buried it in the wheat.
0:18:14|0:18:18|On the other side, [Yang Yinghua] arrived at the village committee that was already full of people.
0:18:18|0:18:21|Before long, [Braided Man] walked over and sat down next to him.
0:18:21|0:18:23|At this moment, someone spoke up.
0:19:43|0:19:51|[Braided Man] listened and happily patted [Yang Yinghua] on the shoulder, while [Yang Yinghua] walked out with a face full of anger, always hard to please, and quickly followed.
0:20:16|0:20:17|[Yang Yingjun] refuses to listen to advice.
0:20:17|0:20:23|Ma Mei pushed Dumb Brother aside and walked away, leaving Dumb Brother looking helplessly at his back.
0:20:23|0:20:41|[Yang Yinghua] left the drama committee and arrived in the field. He bent over, splashing in the water, his mind returning to his desire for a crowded life with his wife. In front of him were his son, daughter-in-law, and sick granddaughter. His son looked blank, while his daughter-in-law couldn't bear to look and turned her head away.
0:20:41|0:20:50|[Yang Yingjun] and his wife stood aside, at a loss. The scene then shifted to him holding his granddaughter in his arms, boarding the bus with his wife.
0:20:50|0:21:5|The two of them sat in the car in silence, their thoughts unknown. [Yang Yinghua]'s skillful hands gradually stopped, holding seedlings in his hands. He slowly straightened up, breathing heavily, making him appear less calm.
0:21:5|0:21:11|[Yang Yingjun] stared blankly ahead, and before long, he returned home alone.
0:21:11|0:21:20|[Yang Yinghua] stood in the hall for a long time unable to calm down, took a moment to relax, and then walked towards the dining table, picked up the glass of water on it and took a sip.
0:21:20|0:21:28|[Ma Mei] watched her granddaughter sleeping in the room. Hearing a noise outside the door, she reached out to pinch her granddaughter's feet and then got up to walk towards the door.
0:21:29|0:21:35|The creak of the door opening made the granddaughter turn her head, luckily it didn't wake the child.
0:21:35|0:21:42|After Ma Mei walked out, she slowly closed the door and then came to the dining table.
0:22:27|0:22:34|[Yang Yinghua] hands the water cup to Ma Mei, who takes it and walks away.
0:22:44|0:22:59|[Yang Yinghua] blocked the grain in the man's hand, then put the lid of the wooden barrel down. The two of them came to a small wooden barrel on the side. Ma Mei opened the lid of the wooden barrel, inside of which was half a barrel of rice. She then opened several other wooden barrels nearby, each containing peanuts and duck eggs.
0:23:0|0:23:8|Next, he didn't open the ceramic jar at home first. Inside were liquor, cigarettes, salted vegetables, dried fish, and the remaining few chili peppers.
0:23:8|0:23:13|[Yang Yinghua] opens the unplugged refrigerator at home, only to find it empty.
0:23:13|0:23:18|He reached into the second layer of the partition and pulled out a small tiger plush toy from inside.
0:23:19|0:23:25|After squeezing it in his hand, he placed it above the refrigerator and then closed the refrigerator door.
0:23:25|0:23:28|[Yang Yingjun] saw this scene and helplessly turned away.
0:23:28|0:23:35|[Ma Mei] is standing by, her eyes following him, and the two of them are silent in tacit understanding.
0:23:35|0:23:45|[Yang Yinghua] walked to the wall, looked at the photos on the wall, sighed helplessly, pinched his brow, then sat down on the chair and asked.
0:23:49|0:23:52|[Yang Yinghua] turned his head and looked at [Ma Mei], saying,
0:24:13|0:24:24|[Ma Mei] looked at [Yang Yinghua]'s face in surprise, then straightened up and carefully examined the accounts on the table. After that, she turned to her husband and said,
0:24:28|0:24:32|[Yang Yinghua], after listening to [Ma Mei]'s words, thought for a moment and then said thoughtfully,
0:24:50|0:24:57|[Yang Yinghua] sat aside watching him, only to see [Ma Mei] licking her fingers, then flipping through the account book. After finding the answer, she said,
0:25:22|0:25:26|[Yang Yinghua] silently looked at [Ma Mei] and after a while said,
0:25:38|0:25:42|[Yang Yingjun] sighed helplessly, then said persistently,
0:26:33|0:26:37|[Yang Yingjun] remained silent with his head down, but [Ma Mei] suddenly exclaimed with joy,
0:26:37|0:26:39|[Ma Mei] nodded after listening, [Yang Yinghua] cleared his throat and continued,
0:26:39|0:26:40|Ma Mei looked at her husband's desolate appearance.
0:27:2|0:27:5|He turned to [Yang Yinghua] and comforted him.
0:27:31|0:27:40|[Yang Yinghua] finished speaking, turned his head and took a deep breath. Ma Mei looked at his expression, sighed, and then closed the account book on the table, speaking with great emphasis.
0:28:3|0:28:8|On the other side, a group of people were having a meeting in the village committee, with the leader sitting in the main seat speaking.
0:28:24|0:28:30|Everyone sat around the table, listening attentively to him speak, nodding in agreement.
0:28:30|0:28:35|Outside, the rain was drizzling down, and most of the people had already left the village committee.
0:28:35|0:28:44|The teacher looked up at the blanket above the room, then lay straight on the back of the chair with his arms crossed in front of his chest.
0:28:44|0:28:50|The teacher, [Wang Shen], who came from the city, turned his head to look at him and spoke at this moment.
0:28:55|0:28:55|Seeing that Wang Shen did not interrupt, the male teacher glanced at him as he was organizing the materials, and then continued speaking.
0:30:15|0:30:20|The teacher looked gloomy, and after a moment of contemplation, Little Wang spoke.
0:30:26|0:30:30|After listening to Xiao Wang's words, Teacher Nan sighed and said.
0:30:33|0:30:36|After speaking, Teacher Nan stood up and left the village committee.
0:30:36|0:30:42|Wang Shen held the documents in his hand, but his eyes were fixed on the back of the departing teacher.
0:30:42|0:30:46|Before long, he shifted his gaze back to the documents in his hands.
0:30:46|0:30:50|Early the next morning, the rooster in the village stood on the high platform and crowed.
0:30:50|0:30:56|He shook his body, tidied the fur in front of him with his mouth, and then walked back and forth on the platform.
0:30:56|0:30:59|The breeze blew, and his feathers danced in the air.
0:30:59|0:31:1|A new day is about to begin.
0:31:2|0:31:15|[Ma Mei] sat barefoot in front of her own door, she combed her hair, wrapped the headscarf around her forehead in circles, and then washed clothes in the yard, while her granddaughter sat on the side looking up at the sky.
0:31:15|0:31:26|The entire village gradually woke up after a quiet night, with villagers starting to head to the fields one after another. Children carried their school bags and happily went to school.
0:31:27|0:31:30|[Yang Yingjun] is throwing seedlings into the field by the terraced fields.
0:31:30|0:31:38|The male teacher held the precise poverty alleviation, impoverished households, and paired assistance roster, and nailed it to the door of [Yang Yinghua].
0:31:38|0:31:40|Wang Shen is handing him nails from behind.
0:31:40|0:31:44|[Ma Mei] heard some noise and quickly took her granddaughter out to check on the side.
0:31:45|0:31:53|The teacher teased the little girl with nails, while Wang Shen looked at the silly look on the little girl's face, pondering about something.
0:31:53|0:32:1|But after the two left, [Ma Mei] took her granddaughter to the field to find her husband.
0:32:1|0:32:6|[Ma Mei] looked nervously up and [Yang Yinghua] asked.
0:32:8|0:32:15|Sensing that something was amiss in the atmosphere, Yang Lan, who was working nearby, looked up at [Yang Yinghua] and then at [Ma Mei].
0:32:15|0:32:18|[Ma Mei] chirped about what had happened.
0:32:18|0:32:24|[Yang Yingjun] was furious after hearing this, he immediately put down the farm work in his hands and rushed back home to investigate.
0:32:24|0:32:31|He walked up to his own door, his eyes fixed on the poverty alleviation loan card, and tore it off angrily.
0:32:31|0:32:34|[Ma Mei] arrived with her granddaughter and witnessed the scene.
0:32:38|0:32:42|Several people from the village committee hurried to Yang Yinghua's house upon hearing the news.
0:32:42|0:32:53|Before even entering the room, [Yang Yinghua] was pushed out of the door by [Ma Mei].
0:32:53|0:32:59|Yang Yinghua brushed past several people from the village committee without waiting for them to finish speaking, and walked outside.
0:32:59|0:33:0|They saw the situation and quickly caught up to persuade.
0:33:2|0:33:13|[Ma Mei] clung to the door, watching the departing crowd. Her mouth was wide open, her eyes staring straight in the direction her husband left, as if she was stunned by the scene.
0:33:13|0:33:20|Before long, it started to rain heavily, with the raindrops falling on the stacked old tiles, making a pitter-patter sound.
0:33:20|0:33:26|[Ma Mei] stood beside the window in her house, her hands resting on the edge of the window, her eyes gazing into the distance.
0:33:28|0:33:41|The sound of her granddaughter's babbling came into her ears, [Ma Mei] slowly turned her head and looked at the little girl playing on the eaves, her thoughts returning to the day her granddaughter was diagnosed.
0:33:41|0:33:47|[Yang Yingjun] carries his granddaughter still wrapped in a bundle, with [Ma Mei] carrying a stone tablet on her back, walking through the mountains.
0:33:47|0:33:55|While walking, a light rain suddenly started falling. They took shelter by the rocks with their granddaughter, thinking about what the doctor had just said.
0:33:57|0:34:3|Dad is seriously ill, and the two of them were stunned when they heard the doctor's words.
0:34:3|0:34:7|[Ma Mei] looked at her husband and comforted him.
0:34:45|0:34:49|[Ma Mei] touched her husband's arm when she saw him not responding.
0:34:58|0:35:3|[Yang Yingjun] spoke with a serious expression, while [Ma Mei] stood by with a smiling face.
0:35:3|0:35:12|Before long, [Ma Mei] unfolded the rouge fish wrapped in leaves on the porridge, and then took out a five-kilogram liquid in a plastic bucket to treat her granddaughter.
0:35:13|0:35:22|In this way, [Ma Mei] carries her granddaughter in a bamboo basket every day, with a radio hanging on the basket, trekking through mountains and rivers to the clinic for treatment.
0:35:22|0:35:29|No matter wind or rain, or extreme cold or heat, [Ma Mei] takes her granddaughter to see a doctor day after day, year after year.
0:35:32|0:35:40|As time passed, the granddaughter no longer needed to be wrapped in blankets. [Ma Mei] still carried her in a bamboo basket to see the doctor.
0:35:40|0:35:49|The granddaughter is growing up gradually and learning to walk on her own. The expression on [Ma Mei]'s face has changed from serious to a smile.
0:35:50|0:36:0|On the way to see a doctor, the granddaughter tried to walk alone, with [Ma Mei] guarding her from behind. When the granddaughter was about to fall, [Ma Mei] quickly stepped forward to protect her.
0:36:0|0:36:4|Some time passed, and the granddaughter was able to walk by herself along the edge.
0:36:4|0:36:15|She tilted her head up to the sky, with her tongue awkwardly twisted at the corner of her mouth, sitting on the doorstep babbling, and then playing with a plastic toy horse in the room.
0:36:15|0:36:18|[Yang Yinghua] and his wife were happily watching from the side,
0:36:53|0:37:3|The memory ends, [Ma Mei] smiles as she watches Little Pumpkin play by the window, then she walks up to him and gives him some water.
0:37:3|0:37:11|At night, the atmosphere in the village committee was unusually tense. Everyone sat in a circle, all eyes unconsciously fixed on [Dumb Brother].
0:37:11|0:37:14|Wang Shen sat next to him, blinked his eyes without saying a word.
0:37:14|0:37:16|Suddenly, the male teacher spoke up,
0:37:19|0:37:27|After the teacher, with a blank expression, announced the decision, everyone around turned to look at him, but no one said a word.
0:37:27|0:37:32|One day, the clouds filled the hills and terraces, like a beautiful painting.
0:37:32|0:37:40|Before the villagers had even started working, [Yang Yinghua] had already left Eighteen Buildings Village, carrying a backpack and dragging a suitcase step by step.
0:37:46|0:37:49|[Ma Mei] is washing clothes at the village entrance with Little Pumpkin.
0:37:49|0:37:58|At this moment, a big woman carrying a basin of clothes came down the stairs. She squatted next to [Ma Mei] and took out a piece of clothing from the basin to start beating it.
0:37:58|0:38:3|The old lady looked at [Ma Mei] beside her and spoke.
0:38:12|0:38:19|[Ma Mei] was shocked by what the old lady said, she immediately raised her head, forgetting to even continue beating the clothes in her hands.
0:38:19|0:38:29|She then quickly ran to the field with Little Pumpkin on her back to find her husband.
0:38:29|0:38:36|[Yang Yinghua] learned about the situation through [Ma Mei], immediately stopped what he was doing, and ran towards the direction where Xiao Long had left.
0:38:36|0:38:48|He hurriedly climbed the steps, and after running for a while, finally saw Xiaolong, who was carrying a large bag and pulling a suitcase, ready to leave by the roadside at the edge of the village.
0:38:48|0:38:52|[Yang Yingjun] quickly walked up to him and began to explain.
0:39:48|0:39:58|After Xiaolong finished speaking, he disappeared dramatically into the bustling street, leaving [Yang Yinghua] standing alone in the busy street.
0:39:58|0:40:3|He was wearing Tibetan clothes for fieldwork, which made him stand out in this city.
0:40:27|0:40:30|[Yang Yingjun] took off his straw hat and remained silent.
0:40:30|0:40:34|He waved his hand, signaling his comrades to enter the room for further discussion.
0:40:34|0:40:37|Comrades understand each other's intentions and follow closely.
0:40:37|0:40:38|[Yang Yinghua] spoke up.
0:41:22|0:41:23|The golden dress is torn.
0:42:19|0:42:21|Later, everyone went to work in the countryside.
0:42:27|0:42:32|[Yang Yingjun] listened to his comrades without saying a word, deeply exhaling a sigh.
0:42:32|0:42:36|Comrades looked at [Yang Yinghua] quietly without saying a word.
0:42:36|0:42:47|Later, [Yang Yinghua] sat on the small truck returning to the village, driving on the road surrounded by terraced fields, looking at the rice seedlings planted on both sides.
0:42:47|0:42:54|Thoughts returned to the moment when Ma Mei and Wang Shen were separated in the crowded train station, with Ma Mei calling out her name in desperation.
0:43:3|0:43:9|Due to the large crowd, the wife reached out at the station but couldn't catch him no matter how hard she tried.
0:43:9|0:43:18|[Yang Yingjun] sat in the car, watching the large trucks and logistics vehicles passing by on the overpass in the distance. After a while, he withdrew his gaze.
0:43:18|0:43:25|In my mind, a scene appears with a family of three sitting at the table eating. [Ma Mei] shares her rice with her son, then speaks to [Yang Yinghua].
0:43:37|0:43:57|Soon, it was time for [Ma Mei] to go out to work. The station was filled with people carrying large and small bags, their bodies pressed against each other as they slowly made their way to the train. The platform was already packed with people, and the train staff could not maintain order. Large groups of people squeezed onto the train.
0:43:57|0:44:4|More daringly, some people climbed onto the train directly from outside the window, with [Ma Mei] among them, one of her feet hanging outside as she shouted loudly.
0:44:12|0:44:17|[Yang Yinghua] struggled to help her up onto the train from outside, and finally [Ma Mei] successfully entered the carriage.
0:44:49|0:44:54|[Yang Yingjun] sat on the small truck returning to the village, recalling his wife's encounter at the station.
0:44:54|0:45:0|He sat with his legs curled up, wearing a straw hat and looking down with pursed lips, lost in thought.
0:45:0|0:45:4|At the end of the station, the hand extended by [Ma Mei] was finally grabbed by [Yang Yinghua].
0:45:8|0:45:13|[Yang Yinghua] held [Ma Mei]'s hand and walked against the crowd at the crowded station.
0:45:13|0:45:19|He shielded his wife behind him, pushed through the crowd, and firmly led her away from the station.
0:45:19|0:45:23|[Ma Mei] walked behind him with a furrowed brow, gritting her teeth and lowering her head.
0:45:24|0:45:29|Everyone was walking towards the direction of the train, only [Yang Yinghua] and [Ma Mei] were walking out.
0:45:29|0:45:33|In the crowd, the two of them stood out like a sore thumb.
0:45:33|0:45:38|After coming out of the train station, Wang Shen and Ma Mei walked on the mountain road back to the village.
0:45:38|0:45:45|[Yang Yinghua] looked back in plain clothes, walking with [Ma Mei] in bright attire, hands swinging.
0:45:45|0:45:48|The two smiled at each other, but couldn't feel joy in returning home together.
0:45:50|0:45:59|After reminiscing, [Yang Yinghua] still sat in the small truck heading home, his expressionless face pondering over the various events that had occurred earlier. Doubts had already begun to creep into his mind.
0:46:1|0:46:10|After a day of trivial matters, as the sun gradually began to set, the sunlight sprinkled on the terraced fields, creating a warm and cozy atmosphere.
0:46:10|0:46:20|[Yang Yingjun] returned to the field to continue working. He bent over with a straw hat, planting seedlings in the muddy water. His clothes were covered in mud, but he paid no attention to it at all.
0:46:22|0:46:37|After a busy period, [Yang Yinghua] squatted by the terraced fields to wash his hands. He thought about how his resignation due to poverty had caused Little Long to suffer. His comrades had all become wealthy, while he was labeled as a poor household, which made him choke with emotion.
0:46:37|0:46:45|He turned his head towards the direction of the sun, slowly straightened his body, and looked at the seedlings that had already been planted in front of him, feeling a mix of emotions in his heart.
0:46:47|0:47:0|[Yang Yingjun] faced the sun, standing by the terraced fields. The setting sun shone on his face, his brows furrowed, trembling as he pursed his lips. Tears welled up in his eyes, showing a deep sense of bitterness and vicissitudes.
0:47:18|0:47:32|[Yang Yingjun] stood still in the mud, his back reflected in the water. After a moment of calm, as if accepting his failure, he lifted the empty bamboo basket hanging on the shoulder pole and left.
0:47:35|0:47:44|The gentle breeze swayed the slender seedlings in the mud, and the beautiful scenery seemed particularly heavy because of [Yang Yinghua]'s mood.
0:47:44|0:47:51|After returning home, a makeshift living platform was set up on the open space. [Ma Mei] squatted on the ground, using her mouth to blow into a bamboo tube for daily living.
0:47:51|0:47:59|Then she put down the bamboo tube, used her hands to push the firewood towards the center, and the smoke from daily life made a coughing sound like that of the little pumpkin.
0:48:1|0:48:9|She slowly stood up with her hands on her legs as support, then looked back at [Yang Yinghua].
0:48:9|0:48:16|At the dining table, all the dishes have been set out. [Yang Yinghua] holds a bowl, with chopsticks in hand resting on his leg.
0:48:16|0:48:21|The body was already leaning against the back of the chair, head lowered and asleep.
0:48:21|0:48:28|[Ma Mei] saw [Yang Yinghua] exhausted and asleep on the chair, so she walked slowly to her and sat down opposite her, staring at her quietly.
0:48:30|0:48:35|[Yang Yingjun] remained in the same position, motionless.
0:48:35|0:48:40|The two of them sat here quietly.
0:48:40|0:48:46|At night, the man with braids was shirtless, wiping his body at the place where clothes were washed at the village entrance.
0:48:46|0:48:50|Before long, Wang Shen came down the steps with a basin and toiletries in hand.
0:48:59|0:49:3|After Braided Man finished speaking, he turned around and put on his clothes with his back facing him.
0:49:3|0:49:8|Wang Shen squatted behind, looking at the back of Dumb Brother, who had two thick and long scars.
0:49:8|0:49:14|He immediately stood up in shock, the man with braids finished putting on his clothes, turned around and looked at him, explaining.
0:49:29|0:49:32|Little [Wang Shen] listened and then squatted down to start working again.
0:49:32|0:49:38|He heard someone crying, looked around, and saw Dumb Brother talking while putting on his jacket.
0:50:28|0:50:31|It's difficult to finish the transformation, so [Ma Mei] stood up, picked up the bucket, and wanted to leave.
0:50:31|0:50:36|Little [Wang Shen] looked at the well next to him and asked.
0:51:16|0:51:31|Little [Wang Shen] watched as the man with braids walked away, lost in thought. The structure of the well was carved into the stone, surrounded on both sides and at the back by rocks. A stone was placed on top of the rocks, leaving only one side of the well open.
0:51:31|0:51:36|Little [Wang Shen] sat on the stone platform next to the well for a while, then turned his head towards the well.
0:51:39|0:51:44|Seeing the bowls placed above the well, he couldn't help but stand up and walk towards the well.
0:51:44|0:51:53|Little [Wang Shen] lowered his head and looked at the clear spring water flowing slowly in front of him. He picked up the bowl above and scooped a bowl of water from the spring, holding it against his chest.
0:51:53|0:52:0|He lowered his head, took a sip to taste, and finally held the bowl with both hands, tilting his head back to finish drinking.
0:52:0|0:52:3|After tasting the sweet spring water, [Ma Mei] smacked his lips.
0:52:6|0:52:14|Early the next morning, the women in the village were washing their dirty clothes by the well, with [Ma Mei] and Little Pumpkin among them.
0:52:14|0:52:21|Little Pumpkin was playing with toys in his hands, standing on the pillar on the side, while [Ma Mei] squatted on the ground washing clothes.
0:52:21|0:52:26|Next to them, an old man carrying a bamboo basket on his back is leading a cow up the steps, as a new day is about to begin.
0:52:30|0:52:39|[Yang Yingjun] walked towards the field carrying a basket full of seedlings. At this moment, in the vast mountains, his figure appeared so lonely.
0:52:39|0:52:45|Down the mountain, the smoke from cooking rises, adding a touch of liveliness to the scene.
0:52:45|0:52:53|He stood by the terraced fields, tossing the seedlings from the bamboo basket into the mud, took a deep breath, and then started planting the seedlings.
0:52:58|0:53:11|[Yang Yinghua] was working in the field, when [Wang Shen] walked over from a distance. Seeing the busy [Yang Yinghua], he didn't hesitate to wade into the mud, walking towards him and speaking at the same time.
0:53:16|0:53:26|[Yang Yinghua] stood up straight and was stunned after hearing this, while [Wang Shen] didn't offer any explanation. He skillfully picked up the seedlings, bent over, and started planting them on the side.
0:53:28|0:53:34|[Yang Yingjun] stood still and looked at him quietly. After a while, he spoke up and asked.
0:54:23|0:54:26|The two of them chatted until dusk.
0:54:26|0:54:31|[Yang Yingjun] walked ahead, with [Wang Shen] following behind carrying a shoulder pole.
0:54:31|0:54:36|They walked slowly towards the home of [Yang Yinghua], one in front and one behind.
0:54:36|0:54:41|Upon entering the house, Little Pumpkin sat on the plastic horse, staring blankly at the newcomers.
0:54:41|0:54:45|The walls of the house are covered with photos of the [Yang Yinghua] family.
0:54:45|0:54:47|[Wang Shen] entered the room and stood by the wall to watch.
0:54:50|0:54:56|[Yang Yinghua] served three fish, a bowl of chili, and chili powder on the dining table.
0:54:56|0:54:59|[Wang Shen] held a bowl of rice and ate heartily.
0:54:59|0:55:1|[Yang Yinghua] stared at him and said.
0:55:4|0:55:9|[Wang Shen] paused for a moment after hearing it, then looked towards [Yang Yinghua].
0:55:9|0:55:14|[Yang Yinghua] took a sip of wine from the bowl and then set it down.
0:55:14|0:55:18|Wang Shen also put down the bowl in his hand and stared straight at him.
0:55:20|0:55:20|The end.
0:56:23|0:56:34|[Yang Yinghua] picked up the bowl and took a sip of wine, then [Ma Mei] continued.
0:56:34|0:56:44|[Yang Yinghua] and Wang Shen remained silent after hearing this. Ma Mei squatted on the ground to start a fire with a bamboo tube, then placed the bamboo tube on the ground before sitting down on a nearby chair.
0:56:58|0:57:5|[Yang Yinghua] glanced at Wang Shen, then reached out to pick up the bowl on the table.
0:57:5|0:57:11|Little Wang listened to [Yang Yinghua]'s slightly mocking words, staring at him with his eyes fixed.
0:57:11|0:57:24|Liang Jiu stood up on one leg, took out his car key from his pocket, placed it on the table in front of [Yang Yinghua], then picked up a bowl of wine and handed it to [Yang Yinghua], and swallowed it in one gulp.
0:57:24|0:57:29|[Yang Yinghua] and Ma Mei stared at him without saying a word.
0:57:29|0:57:33|One day, [Yang Yinghua] was working in the field.
0:57:33|0:57:36|Wang Shen ran over from a distance in a hurry, shouting loudly.
0:57:38|0:57:40|He ran up to [Yang Yinghua] and smiled.
0:58:26|0:58:32|[Yang Yinghua] was planting seedlings in the field, and after a moment of contemplation, he said to Xiao Long.
0:58:37|0:58:43|[Ma Mei] is frying chili noodles in the kitchen, while Xiaonan hangs at the door, watching a basket of chicks.
0:58:43|0:58:50|[Yang Yinghua] returned home from the field, hung his straw hat on the bamboo basket, and then sat on the steps.
0:59:7|0:59:10|Little Pumpkin sat on the floor in the room playing with toys.
0:59:10|0:59:14|[Yang Yingjun] walked in and squatted beside him, using his hand to wipe his nose.
0:59:14|0:59:19|He then got up and sat at the dining table, and complained to [Ma Mei].
0:59:41|0:59:44|He picked up the glass on the table and took a sip.
0:59:44|0:59:51|At night, several members of the Yang family received a notice to gather at [Yang Yinghua]'s house.
0:59:51|0:59:55|On the other side, Xiao Wang is reporting to the leader in the village committee.
1:0:43|1:0:49|Little Wang nodded in agreement, while on the other side, [Yang Yinghua] talked to his family.
1:2:30|1:2:41|It's not time to drink water yet. Yang Yinglian is humming aside, using sign language to tell [Yang Yingjun] to go and call Xiao Long back. I want him to come back.
1:2:52|1:3:0|Yang Yinglian continued to gesture and write with a pen in front of Dumb Brother, "You don't go out to work, just wandering around all day, drinking until you're drunk."
1:3:2|1:3:5|The man with braids then coldly turned around and said with a sneer.
1:3:23|1:3:37|[Yang Yinghua] realized as he spoke that he was about to lose his temper. He quickly took the water cup from [Ma Mei], took a sip, let out a deep breath, calmed himself down, and then continued speaking.
1:4:27|1:4:35|Ma Mei is giving him ideas on the side.
1:4:35|1:4:38|Yang Yinglian lowered her head upon hearing these words.
1:4:40|1:4:47|[Ma Mei] quickly handed the water cup to [Yang Yinghua], who took a sip.
1:4:47|1:4:49|Braided Man [Yang Lan] looked at the person in front of him and said.
1:4:49|1:4:50|[Yang Lan] stood up and wanted to leave.
1:5:22|1:5:26|Ma Mei immediately handed the water cup to her husband when she saw him angry.
1:5:26|1:5:34|Unexpectedly, [Yang Yinghua] was so angry that he grabbed the water cup and smashed it, scaring [Yang Lan] and [Yang Weiwei] to run out quickly.
1:5:34|1:5:38|Ma Mei stood up in shock, and Wang Shen quickly ran out when he saw this scene.
1:5:40|1:5:48|It was pouring rain outside. After running out of Yang Yinghua's house, Ma Mei, Wang Shen, and Dumb Brother didn't care about anything else and immediately ran towards their own homes.
1:5:48|1:5:55|[Yang Yingjun] was furious in the room, his eyes staring at a spot, breathing heavily.
1:5:55|1:6:0|He turned his head and blinked his eyes, then lowered his head, lost in thought.
1:6:0|1:6:8|[Ma Mei] slowly walked forward with a water cup in her hand. Instead of comforting her husband who looked helpless, she stood aside quietly watching him.
1:6:10|1:6:15|Early the next morning, the villagers wearing hats and carrying sickles arrived at the village committee.
1:6:15|1:6:19|The young man washing at the door quickly caught up.
1:7:32|1:7:40|Okay, Xiao Wang brought his team to [Yang Yinghua]'s house.
1:7:46|1:7:48|[Yang Yingjun] looked at the people behind him.
1:8:4|1:8:11|Villager [Yang Yinghua] immediately told Xiao Wang that he needed to return to the forest as soon as he heard he was being asked to fight, then turned around and left.
1:8:11|1:8:22|Wang Shen stood in place, watching as he walked away, then turned to glance at [Yang Yinghua]'s figure. He then held a straw hat in his hand and ran towards Yang Yanlian's house.
1:8:22|1:8:30|Yang Yinglian handed her daughter's graduation certificate to Wang Shen, who opened it and took a look before heading to Yang Jinsan's house.
1:8:30|1:8:33|[Yang Jinsan] sat on the doorstep of his house.
1:8:37|1:8:45|[Yang Jinsan] looked at him self-deprecatingly, then lowered his head. Seeing this, Wang Shen directly stepped over the threshold and walked into the room.
1:8:45|1:8:54|In the dim and damp room, two slightly older little girls, one standing at the table picking vegetables, the other squatting on the ground.
1:8:54|1:8:59|On the ground cushion sat a child whose face was unclear, while Xiao Wang looked towards another direction.
1:9:0|1:9:5|There is a little girl doing her homework at the table, she walks to the door and asks [Yang Jinsan].
1:9:36|1:9:43|[Yang Jinsan] listened to his words, with a puzzled expression, asked, while Little Wang was so angry with his actions that he didn't know what to say, and could only stand by in a mess.
1:9:46|1:9:55|Then he arrived at the home of [Yang Lan], only to find [Yang Lan] with his legs crossed, leaning back in a chair fast asleep.
1:9:55|1:10:3|[Yang Lan] was awakened by Xiao Wang's voice. He opened his eyes and glanced around, his gaze following Xiao Wang's movements.
1:10:3|1:10:13|Wang Shen first looked inside through the door curtain of the adjacent room, then he looked around the whole house, and said to [Yang Lan].
1:10:32|1:10:35|[Yang Lan] finished speaking and then lay down on the rocking chair and fell asleep.
1:10:35|1:10:41|Wang Shen looked at him helplessly and had to help clean the house for him.
1:10:41|1:10:45|He was cleaning the dust on the floor with a mop, and [Yang Lan] woke up at this moment.
1:11:26|1:11:33|During the encounter, Wang Shen and the Yang family were all in the house of [Yang Yinghua], with Ma Mei handing a glass of water to [Yang Yinghua].
1:11:45|1:11:47|[Yang Yingjun] heard this and happily turned to his wife, saying.
1:12:37|1:12:41|Yingying brought everyone to her own field.
1:12:41|1:12:43|He walked to the center of two terraces and spoke to the crowd, only knowing that one field belonged to [Ma Mei].
1:13:29|1:13:32|[Yang Yinghua] looked at him in surprise and asked.
1:14:1|1:14:7|After Yang Yinghua finished speaking, everyone looked at this piece of land, and [Wang Shen] was the first to speak.
1:14:38|1:14:41|[Yang Yinghua] turned around and looked at him in confusion.
1:14:46|1:14:49|Everyone returned to Yang Yinghua's home and pretended to sit together for a meal.
1:14:49|1:14:53|After [Yang Yinghua] finished speaking, everyone at the table looked at Xiao Wang.
1:15:21|1:15:27|[Yang Yingjun] shook his head, and after listening, Little Wang couldn't come up with a specific solution either.
1:15:27|1:15:31|Ma Mei was cleaning up the dishes while saying.
1:15:43|1:15:51|Ma Mei took a step back to get the rice, [Yang Yinghua] took a sip of water and continued speaking.
1:16:43|1:16:52|Ma Mei put a bag of rice into the bamboo basket, then carried a bucket of wine, and finally took out some pickled fish from the earthen jar, asking her husband to take them to [Yang Yinghua].
1:16:54|1:17:6|In the evening, a group of young people assisting in poverty alleviation sat around the village committee, each holding a large amount of information and discussing with others, all working to help the villagers out of poverty.
1:17:6|1:17:13|Wang Shen sat on the side checking the computer, and the map information of Shiba Village appeared on the screen.
1:17:13|1:17:43|On the other side, [Yang Yinghua] squatted next to his own field with a plastic bucket in hand, using a ladle to scoop small fish from the bucket and put them into the muddy water where the seedlings were planted.
1:17:43|1:17:48|[Yang Yingjun] looked up with a puzzled expression, but decided to go with him to take a look.
1:17:48|1:17:56|Wang Shen drove his small car with [Yang Yinghua] sitting beside him, passing through the narrow mountain road and a nearby mine.
1:17:59|1:18:10|The car made a final turn and drove onto the empty ground next to the street. It slowly came to a stop in the center of the open space, with the body of the car covered in mud.
1:18:10|1:18:13|The two got off the car to take a look, and [Yang Yinghua] sighed.
1:19:19|1:19:27|Next, he stood up with the ore in his hand, extended his left arm straight, and then opened his hand to let the ore scatter on the ground.
1:19:27|1:19:34|He shook his hands, scattering all the ore, then glanced at Ma Mei beside him, clapped his hands and left.
1:19:35|1:19:42|Wang Shen watched his departing figure, hands on hips, unsure of what to say. After hesitating for a while, he also left.
1:19:42|1:19:48|On the other side, several villagers climbed up the mountain road, looking at several wooden sticks lying across the road.
1:20:31|1:20:35|[Yang Yinghua] gestured with his hand, indicating [Yang Lan] to give her opinion.
1:20:35|1:20:37|[Yang Yinglan] said helplessly.
1:20:46|1:20:50|[Yang Yinglan] looked at him, then licked his lips and said.
1:20:55|1:21:18|Lushui River, where there are many people, [Yang Lan] hesitated for a few seconds, turned her eyes and thought for a while, then shook her head and said firmly.
1:21:18|1:21:25|[Yang Yinglan] stood up and left after speaking, [Yang Yinglian] watched him leave, then pursed her lips and got up without saying a word.
1:21:27|1:21:35|After the two left, a group of people in the neighborhood committee became lifeless like wilted eggplants, all immersed in silence.
1:21:35|1:21:42|At this moment, the [Grandpa] sitting on the side suggested.
1:21:42|1:21:43|The uncle said.
1:21:48|1:21:55|They arrived at the doorstep of [Yang Yinglan]'s house, led by the opinionated [Dumb Brother], staring at [Yang Yinglan] sitting against the door lintel.
1:21:57|1:22:1|[Yang Yinglan] closed her eyes tightly, clearly not wanting to see the newcomer.
1:22:1|1:22:3|At this moment, [Grandpa] spoke up.
1:22:21|1:22:26|As soon as the words fell, [Grandpa Gao] standing on the side also sternly shouted.
1:22:28|1:22:37|[Yang Yinglan] looked at the three [uncles] in front of her, then turned her head to look ahead.
1:22:37|1:22:41|Liang Jiu, standing on the side, was also speaking, said [Short Song Grandpa].
1:22:45|1:22:51|[Yang Yinglan] straightened up after hearing it, she looked at the expressions of the three [uncles] in front of her, and then nodded slightly.
1:22:54|1:23:1|After a while, [Yang Yinghua] spoke up.
1:23:1|1:23:14|The sky suddenly thundered, the wind howled, and the attacking feathers fluttered in the wind. [Wang Shen] drove with [Yang Yinghua] on the road in the mountains, and soon they returned to the village.
1:23:14|1:23:20|[Ma Mei] scoops from the wine jar into the bowl, while [Dumb Brother] plays with a plastic toy car in the room.
1:23:22|1:23:38|Outside the house, with heavy rain pouring down, [Yang Yinghua] stood at the doorway with his arms crossed, staring silently at a spot outside, lost in his thoughts. Not even [Dumb Brother] pressing against him could distract him.
1:23:38|1:23:41|[Ma Mei] pours the wine from the bowl into a plastic bucket.
1:23:41|1:23:49|At night, the rain finally stopped. [Yang Yinghua] carried a plastic bucket with a painted mouth filled with wine, walking with Yang Yinnian on the village road.
1:23:52|1:23:59|They walked through winding paths and finally arrived at the home of [Yang Yinglan].
1:23:59|1:24:8|At this moment, [Yang Yinglan] is watching TV, lying on a worn-out single sofa. The two people walk directly into her room, and she does not speak first.
1:24:8|1:24:13|[Ma Dongmei] carried a wine barrel and said to [Yang Lan].
1:24:13|1:24:16|[Yang Yinglan] walked to the table with a helpless expression on her face after hearing that.
1:24:19|1:24:27|Next, he took out two bowls from elsewhere and placed them on top, saying.
1:24:27|1:24:31|After speaking, he turned off the TV and sat on the chair next to it.
1:24:31|1:24:35|[Yang Yinghua] saw the situation and placed the wine barrel on the table, saying.
1:24:42|1:24:49|[Yang Yingjun] tied [Yang Lan] to a chair and roared like a pig being slaughtered, attracting Little Wang on the street.
1:25:6|1:25:11|[Yang Yingnian] stuffed a wad of paper into [Yang Yinglan]'s mouth, then stood panting heavily on the side.
1:25:11|1:25:19|After finishing their task, the two were about to leave when they unexpectedly encountered little [Wang Shen] drawn to them by a call from outside the door.
1:25:19|1:25:21|[Yang Yinghua] looked at him and drew a line with his hand.
1:25:29|1:25:41|Little [Wang Shen] watched the two leave without saying a word. He stood outside the door for a long time before finally walking towards the house of [Yang Yinglan]. What greeted his eyes was [Yang Yinglan] tied to a chair.
1:25:41|1:25:48|Little [Wang Shen] walked up to her, feeling a bit sorry for her current situation.
1:25:48|1:25:55|And [Yang Yinghua] turned her head to the side, angry and unwilling to look at her.
1:25:55|1:25:57|Little [Wang Shen] remained silent for a moment, then spoke.
1:26:19|1:26:28|Little [Wang Shen] earnestly tried to persuade, but [Yang Yinghua] listened to him, staring at him angrily, wanting to say something viciously.
1:26:28|1:26:34|The scar on his mouth makes it impossible for him to speak a complete sentence.
1:26:34|1:26:39|On the other side, as [Yang Yinghua] just returned home, his wife [Ma Mei] approached and asked.
1:26:41|1:26:45|[Yang Yingjun] sat on the stool, tapping a doll in his hand and said.
1:27:0|1:27:3|The scene shifts to the home of [Yang Yinghua].
1:27:3|1:27:6|At this moment, the scar in his mouth was removed.
1:27:6|1:27:9|Wang Shen fed him a sip of wine.
1:27:21|1:27:27|Wang Shen stood still holding a bowl, then he put down the wine bowl and picked up a porcelain pipe.
1:27:38|1:27:54|After speaking, his eyes were shining with tears, and his mouth was trembling slightly.
1:27:54|1:28:1|[Yang Yinghua] tearfully expressed her inner fear, sitting on a stool and breathing heavily, stubbornly turning her head to the side.
1:28:5|1:28:14|Xiao Wang, seeing the situation, did not continue his previous actions. He lowered his head for a moment, then picked up the wine bowl on the table and held it to Yang Yinghua's mouth.
1:28:20|1:28:25|[Yang Yinghua] took a sip of wine and lowered his head. It was already late at night, and the village had fallen into silence.
1:28:27|1:28:34|Early the next morning, [Yang Yingjun] set off from home and arrived at the house of [Yang Yinghua].
1:28:34|1:28:38|[Yang Yinghua] is still tied to the chair just like last night.
1:28:38|1:28:43|At this moment, both [Wang Shen] and [Ma Mei] were sound asleep in their chairs.
1:28:43|1:28:48|[Yang Yingjun] stepped forward to untie Yang Lan, the faint movement causing Yang Lan to hum in her sleep.
1:28:52|1:29:6|The sound woke up [Wang Shen] who was sleeping on the side. He saw [Yang Yinghua]'s actions and was scared. He kicked away the wine barrel and immediately stood up to stop [Yang Yinghua].
1:29:23|1:29:29|[Ma Dongjun] released him and walked out of the room, leaving [Wang Shen] standing there looking bewildered.
1:29:33|1:29:54|The mist gradually enveloped the sky above the Eighteen Buildings Village. A group of villagers stood in an open space, with a table in the center. On the table, there was a jar of wine, several small bowls for wine, and three wooden sticks in front of the table. Hanging from the sticks was a chicken, and above it was a round, rusty iron object.
1:29:54|1:29:57|The villagers all looked in the same direction, waiting for the arrival of [Yang Yinghua].
1:29:58|1:30:6|Two Jiu, an old man looked at the watch on his wrist, then happily said.
1:30:11|1:30:20|With these words, happy smiles appeared on the faces of the surrounding villagers, and they cheered with joy.
1:30:20|1:30:23|On the other side, Wang Shen and his two companions drove to the enclave they visited last time.
1:30:26|1:30:33|The vehicle stopped in the center of the enclave, and [Yang Yinghua] immediately got out of the car and shouted.
1:30:33|1:30:40|Wang Wensheng immediately got out of the car, while [Yang Yinghua] stumbled down from the car.
1:30:40|1:30:45|He struggled to close the car door, but before he could take a few steps, he collapsed on the hood of the car.
1:30:45|1:30:48|[Yang Yinghua] walked up to him.
1:31:29|1:31:35|Just now, [Yang Yinghua], who was still in a daze, immediately woke up when he saw the open space around him.
1:31:35|1:31:43|She didn't listen to [Yang Yinghua]'s words, but pushed aside the little Wang standing in front of her, slowly walking forward while looking at the surrounding environment.
1:31:47|1:31:51|The other two couldn't make head or tail of his bewildered look.
1:31:51|1:31:56|[Yang Yingjun] walked aimlessly forward and finally stopped at a place.
1:31:56|1:31:59|He knelt on the ground, bent over, and cupped a pile of ore slag in his hands.
1:32:29|1:32:34|[Yang Yinghua] lay on the ground, regretting deeply, waiting in agony.
1:32:42|1:32:53|[Yang Yinghua] and Xiaolong did not stop when they saw it, [Yang Yinghua] continued to shout.
1:32:53|1:32:57|He choked in pain, punched the ground, and shouted.
1:32:57|1:33:0|[Yang Yinglan] was lying on the ground with her head pressed against the floor, crying out in pain.
1:33:13|1:33:23|He propped himself up and knelt on the ground, with [Yang Yinghua] and Wang Shen standing behind him, silently watching everything.
1:33:23|1:33:33|On the ground, [Yang Yinghua] held up the slag in his hands, looked around at the vast wasteland, and then loudly spoke about his current situation today.
1:34:12|1:34:15|[Yang Yinglan] shouted loudly on the slag heap.
1:34:15|1:34:19|Soon after, the three of them drove along the road in the mountains.
1:34:19|1:34:23|Wang Shen sat in the driver's seat, with [Yang Yinghua] sitting in the passenger seat.
1:34:23|1:34:27|[Yang Yinglan] is behind, staring ahead with eyes like an eagle.
1:34:27|1:34:30|Suddenly, she patted [Yang Yinghua] in front of her and shouted.
1:34:43|1:34:49|Shi Youcheng walked ahead of his fellow workers. As soon as he saw someone approaching, he quickly turned around and ran back.
1:34:49|1:34:57|Little [Wang Shen] and the other two quickly caught up, while the other workers stood still, watching from the side.
1:34:57|1:35:2|The four of them chased each other along a road with the words "Well of Eternal Light" written on the periphery.
1:35:2|1:35:9|Due to his age, [Yang Yinghua] fell behind, and Shi Youcheng couldn't run anymore, so he stood still and raised his hand to surrender.
1:35:9|1:35:12|[Yang Yinglan] reached out and grabbed his shoulder.
1:35:26|1:35:35|[Yang Yingjun] panted from behind, as the scene shifted, the sky was gradually darkening, and little [Wang Shen]'s car was driving on the narrow mountain road back to the village.
1:35:37|1:35:43|[Yang Yinglian] squats at home, blowing into a bamboo tube in her hand, and a thick smoke rises instantly.
1:35:43|1:35:52|Unknown to her, her daughter, little [Yang Weiwei], was standing at the door watching. Then she timidly called out.
1:35:52|1:36:0|[Yang Yinglian] heard a sound, paused for a moment, stopped what she was doing, and turned her head to look towards the door.
1:36:0|1:36:3|Little [Yang Weiwei] leaned against the door frame with a backpack on her back, looking out.
1:36:4|1:36:9|Shi Youcheng is holding two buckets of wine in his hands as he walks to the door.
1:36:10|1:36:17|[Yang Yinglian] stared straight at the two of them, not saying a word, with the slightly trembling corners of her mouth indicating the unrest in her heart at this moment.
1:36:20|1:36:23|The two children stood at the door, too scared to go in.
1:36:23|1:36:26|[Yang Yinglian] looked at it, tears welled up in her eyes.
1:36:26|1:36:31|At this moment, little [Yang Weiwei] walked in from the door, and [Yang Yinghua] burst into tears of joy.
1:36:57|1:37:1|Shi Youcheng enters the room with wine and drinks with [Yang Yinglian].
1:37:1|1:37:10|At night, the villagers all gathered at [Yang Yinglian]'s house, sitting around the table with drinks in hand, each with a smile on their faces.
1:37:10|1:37:17|Shi Youcheng held a wine barrel, while little [Yang Weiwei] carried a water jar to refill everyone's drinks, filling the room with a joyful atmosphere.
1:37:23|1:37:30|The lively sound reached the village committee, a group of young men curiously looked towards the source of the noise at the door.
1:37:30|1:37:32|Two Jiu, a young man said.
1:38:3|1:38:9|The Yang family's home is still lively, with everyone opening up their hearts, singing and drinking.
1:38:9|1:38:13|On the other side, [Yang Yinghua] sat in his own chair, humming a tune.
1:38:32|1:38:43|[Ma Mei] sat at the door, heard a noise, turned to smile at her husband, and then looked into the distance, her thoughts returning to when her son left home.
1:38:43|1:38:45|At that time, she looked at the stool on the beam and said.
1:39:9|1:39:13|[Ma Mei] looked awkwardly at her husband, while her son looked up and said.
1:39:30|1:39:38|The son expressionlessly expressed his thoughts, and [Ma Mei], upon hearing this, looked at him with a blank stare, but ultimately said nothing.
1:39:42|1:39:55|Father and son carried a ladder to remove the stool on the beam. [Ma Mei] sat in the dark, watching silently. Tears glistened in her eyes, her face illuminated and darkened by the firelight.
1:39:55|1:40:3|[Ma Dongjun] took the stool down and wiped it with a cloth, while her son sat in front of her silently watching. Several certificates were still hanging on the wall behind them.
1:40:7|1:40:12|[Ma Mei] watched this scene, feeling really uncomfortable in her heart, tears streaming down from her eyes.
1:40:12|1:40:21|She stood aside, crying silently, wiping the three neatly arranged stools.
1:40:21|1:40:28|The next morning came quickly, and the son left the village carrying three tied-up stools.
1:40:28|1:40:29|He walks on a small path in the mountains.
1:40:31|1:40:37|[Yang Yinghua] is draped in plastic sheeting, wearing a straw hat, standing in the background.
1:40:37|1:40:50|His eyes fixed on the direction his son left, the expression on his face could no longer be contained, tears shimmering in his eyes, and in the end, he couldn't even say a word to his son.
1:40:50|1:40:58|The scene cuts back to reality, with [Yang Yinghua] sitting in a chair in a trance, his eyes staring blankly at a spot, lost in his own thoughts.
1:41:2|1:41:9|Late at night, the villagers all came out of [Yang Yinghua]'s house and headed towards their own homes.
1:41:9|1:41:15|The room was still lit, with [Yang Weiwei] sitting inside, giving instructions to Shi Youcheng.
1:42:3|1:42:8|The next morning, Shi Youcheng scooped up a bowl of water to drink from the well at the village entrance.
1:42:8|1:42:10|[Yang Yingjun] expresses.
1:42:28|1:42:36|[Ma Weiwei] talked about her thoughts, and both [Yang Yinghua] and his wife showed relieved smiles.
1:42:36|1:42:39|At this moment, Ma Mei suddenly rushed over and hugged Wang Shen.
1:42:39|1:42:42|Ma Mei quickly stepped forward to pick up Little Pumpkin.
1:42:54|1:42:59|[Ma Mei] smiled and answered Little Weiwei's question while holding Little Pumpkin.
1:42:59|1:43:4|[Yang Yingjun] sat on the side, arms crossed in front of his chest, nodding in agreement.
1:43:4|1:43:15|The people in the room nodded and smiled at these words, except for [Yang Yinghua] who sat with a bitter expression, creating an awkward atmosphere in the room.
1:43:15|1:43:18|Finally, [Ma Mei] indulgently tapped the tip of Little Pumpkin's nose with her finger.
1:43:21|1:43:30|The [Yang family] arrived at the slag heap, wearing straw hats and carrying baskets of soil on their backs to fill the land.
1:43:30|1:43:44|[Yang Jinsan] poured the soil from the basket onto the ground, looking at the empty mining land with a sigh.
1:43:44|1:43:51|[Yang Yinghua] joked that in the home of [Yang Jinsan], a little girl sat at the door reading aloud from a book.
1:44:9|1:44:12|The daughters all looked at her in astonishment when they heard this.
1:44:12|1:44:17|On the mountain road, a tricycle is carrying a woman with a smile on her face.
1:44:47|1:44:49|[Yang Jinshan] has now arrived at the doorstep of his home.
1:44:49|1:44:55|Yang Jinshan's wife has returned from outside and brought gifts for their four daughters.
1:45:10|1:45:24|She watched her husband happily as he wielded the hoe, feeling genuinely pleased in her heart. Finally, she no longer had to work outside to support the family.
1:45:24|1:45:39|The men of the [Yang family] placed the bamboo baskets on the ground, holding hoes and shovels to fill the baskets with soil. Then they carried the baskets filled with soil to the side of a small truck, emptied the soil into the back of the truck, and repeated this process back and forth until the truck was full.
1:45:43|1:45:47|The group sat in a car filled with soil, driving towards the slag heap.
1:45:47|1:45:55|They looked at the scenery along the way without any communication, but their faces showed a content and peaceful expression.
1:45:55|1:46:1|Upon reaching the destination, everyone got off the car and filled the soil on the slag field, then returned to the original location.
1:46:1|1:46:8|At night, [Yang Yinghua], along with two others, went to the well at the village entrance, scooping up the accumulated water to wash away the fatigue of the day.
1:46:14|1:46:21|One day, [Ma Mei] carried a bamboo basket with a little pumpkin inside, climbed up the long steps, and arrived at the home of [Yang Yinghua].
1:46:21|1:46:25|She processed each small fish and put them into a wooden barrel.
1:46:25|1:46:27|Little [Weiwei] is standing aside.
1:46:44|1:46:50|Little Pumpkin was wandering around outside with a bamboo basket, and [Ma Mei] felt relieved when she saw him.
1:46:50|1:46:52|Yang Weiwei is up next.
1:47:13|1:47:20|Little [Weiwei] was stunned after hearing this, she looked at [Ma Mei] with an uncomfortable feeling in her heart.
1:47:20|1:47:25|The little pumpkin in the other room has already crossed the threshold alone.
1:47:25|1:47:32|She opened her arms and skipped through the room where adults were present, then walked alone into the depths of the woods.
1:47:32|1:47:37|While [Ma Mei] and little [Weiwei] were busy in the room, they didn't notice where Little Pumpkin had gone.
1:47:42|1:47:46|The two put the cooked fish into a clay pot.
1:47:58|1:48:6|In another room, there was no sound at all, [Ma Mei] suddenly felt something was wrong and quickly went out to check.
1:48:6|1:48:9|The room was empty without Little Pumpkin's figure.
1:48:19|1:48:32|Yang Weiwei first stabilized Ma Mei, then ran to the back of the house to check, only to find no sign of Little Pumpkin anywhere, causing her to panic.
1:48:32|1:48:36|[Ma Mei] went down the stairs to go home, while little [Weiwei] went up the stairs to look for a phone.
1:48:42|1:48:55|Ma Mei stumbled all the way to the house. She crossed the threshold of the door, pushed open the door of the room with both hands, walked silently into the room, looked at every corner of the room with her eyes, but still did not see the declaration of Little Magnolia.
1:48:55|1:48:59|She hurriedly turned back, ran to the door, and put her hands on the door frame.
1:49:7|1:49:14|And at this moment, Little Pumpkin had already happily bounced into an environment surrounded by bushes and tall trees.
1:49:14|1:49:20|It watched the small insects flying in front of it, running to chase after them while using its hands to catch them.
1:49:20|1:49:22|Walking along, they arrived at the edge of a 100-meter-high cliff.
1:49:24|1:49:29|Little Pumpkin was completely unaware of the danger, just blindly following the little bug.
1:49:29|1:49:33|He stopped at the edge of the cliff, reaching out his hands towards the insects around him.
1:49:33|1:49:38|He happily bounced around, all his attention focused on catching bugs.
1:49:38|1:49:40|Having fun, they joyfully shouted out loud.
1:50:18|1:50:26|[Yang Weiwei] and [Ma Mei] were shouting Little Pumpkin's name loudly in the woods, and the villagers all started helping them search.
1:50:26|1:50:38|[Ma Mei] searched and searched, feeling a wave of despair in her heart. She looked up at the sun and continued her search.
1:50:38|1:50:52|[Yang Weiwei] was sweating profusely under the sunlight, anxiously searching for Xiaonangua's figure. Suddenly, she heard a faint sound behind her, and she quickly turned around to see Xiaonangua's figure in the bushes.
1:50:52|1:50:56|He bent over, watching Little Pumpkin standing at the edge of the cliff, his heart racing.
1:51:1|1:51:4|[Yang Weiwei] stared with wide eyes, as if frozen in place.
1:51:4|1:51:8|At this moment, [Ma Mei] and the villagers appeared behind her.
1:51:8|1:51:11|[Ma Mei] saw this dangerous situation and immediately moved forward.
1:51:11|1:51:19|[Yang Weiwei] directly opened her arms to block her, then placed her right index finger near her lips, making a gesture of silence.
1:51:19|1:51:24|The two held hands and slowly walked towards Little Pumpkin.
1:51:24|1:51:26|The villagers followed behind them slowly.
1:51:33|1:51:40|They tried to make as little noise as possible as they walked lightly towards the edge of the cliff.
1:51:40|1:51:48|Little Pumpkin was still playing happily there, [Ma Mei] and Weiwei grabbed Little Pumpkin's body and fell backwards.
1:52:38|1:52:42|Under the drizzle, Little Pumpkin was brought back home by [Ma Mei].
1:52:42|1:52:50|[Yang Yinghua] sat at the door holding her granddaughter, facing [Ma Mei], both talking to Little Pumpkin about their inner thoughts.
1:52:50|1:52:52|Little Pumpkin laughed happily after hearing it.
1:52:55|1:52:59|The scene shifts, with Wang Shen and the men from the Yang family working in the fields.
1:52:59|1:53:7|Their clothes were covered in mud, but not a single person stopped their hands from digging into the soil without a moment's pause.
1:53:7|1:53:13|Yang Yinglian and her son-in-law Shi Youcheng, holding a shovel, are scooping soil into the bamboo basket.
1:53:13|1:53:16|Yang Yinglan and Yang Jinsan are also working hard.
1:53:16|1:53:19|Wang Shen continued to bend over and wave the shovel while working.
1:53:21|1:53:29|After filling multiple bamboo baskets, they poured the soil onto the cart, and several people sat on the cart with dirty faces.
1:53:29|1:53:33|After arriving at the location, they got off the car and poured the soil onto the slag heap.
1:53:33|1:53:40|In the evening, Wang Shen followed [Yang Yinghua] back home, and the two sat at the table eating and chatting.
1:55:24|1:55:30|[Yang Yingjun] looked at Wang Shen in surprise, but Wang Shen didn't pay attention and continued speaking.
1:56:32|1:56:34|Wang Shen finished speaking and lowered his head. He picked up the wine bowl on the table and took a sip.
1:56:34|1:56:35|[Yang Yinghua] and [Ma Mei] sat across from each other, silently watching him.
1:57:42|1:57:56|In a simple and persistent manner, Xiao Wang confides his and his father's story to [Yang Yinghua].
1:57:56|1:58:2|Until now, he finally understood his father's good intentions and regretted not being able to rush back to see him one last time.
1:58:4|1:58:10|Warm tears flowed from his eyes, and he lifted his glasses to wipe the tears from his face.
1:58:10|1:58:16|[Ma Mei] was infected by him, silently wiping away tears on the side.
1:58:16|1:58:20|Time passed slowly and dusk arrived.
1:58:20|1:58:23|[Yang Yingjun] sat on the chair and sighed.
1:58:55|1:59:0|[Ma Mei] handed a cup of water to [Yang Yinghua], who took it and smiled at Xiao Wang.
1:59:19|1:59:26|[Yang Yingjun] looked at the stool on the beam while speaking, and [Ma Mei] followed his gaze.
1:59:26|1:59:29|One morning, the village's broadcast began to play a message.
2:0:41|2:0:50|[Ma Mei] is making small fish at home. She puts the finished product into a clay pot, adds salted chili peppers, and then adds water.
2:0:50|2:0:54|After finishing, put the lid on and then added a basin of water around the lid.
2:1:6|2:1:14|[Poverty Alleviation Leader] stood between the blackboards in the village committee house, explaining the future development plan of the village to the few villagers.
2:1:14|2:1:22|The room was bustling with people coming and going. Staff members took down quilts from the rafters and handed them to the young people returning to the village.
2:1:22|2:1:28|Some villagers stood beside the old lady weaving and embroidering, while the children played and frolicked in the room.
2:1:33|2:1:39|In the village, a meeting is being held, with women holding drumsticks to beat the drum.
2:1:39|2:1:43|Villagers from other villages came to Shibaodong Village, dressed up in their best clothes.
2:1:43|2:1:47|[Yang Yinghua] stood at the lively gathering, watching as someone approached.
2:1:47|2:1:52|At this moment, a woman was talking to her friend as she walked past them.
2:1:52|2:1:55|Yang Yinghua's eyes immediately followed her.
2:1:55|2:1:58|When the woman walked out of her sight, she remembered to go after her.
2:2:0|2:2:5|In the bustling village, a large number of outsiders crowded the streets, making it difficult to move.
2:2:5|2:2:10|[Yang Yinghua] approached, searching for the woman's figure, but couldn't find her no matter how hard he tried.
2:2:10|2:2:17|She anxiously looked around in the crowd, and suddenly caught sight of the woman she fell in love with at first sight.
2:2:17|2:2:21|She quietly approached behind the woman and tapped her foot with the tip of her own.
2:2:21|2:2:25|The woman turned back and met eyes with [Yang Yinghua], and they both shyly smiled at each other.
2:2:32|2:2:42|A small passenger van drove up, with three stools tied on top of the vehicle, indicating that the [Yang Yinghua] family was about to reunite.
