0:0:48|0:0:59|As soon as the words fell, the workers who were about to start work in the old factory outside the river suddenly ran away. At this moment, a muffled thunder resounded through the sky, and fist-sized raindrops immediately hit the heavy cotton jackets.
0:1:1|0:1:8|In the crowded crowd, a young woman with a mushroom hairstyle is shaking off the rainwater from her body under the eaves.
0:1:8|0:1:19|With another glance up, a tall man brushed past her.
0:1:19|0:1:23|In the studio, a young woman put down her pen and looked up as a voice came from across the room.
0:1:23|0:1:27|Shortly after, the tall man stooped down and peered in from the doorway.
0:1:33|0:1:40|The tall man handed the key to the young man sitting across the table, nodded and then turned to walk outside.
0:1:40|0:1:47|The young woman, who had originally smiled at him, had no choice but to pick up the documents on the table and walk towards the workshop.
0:1:47|0:1:52|In the scene, three men are gathered together.
0:2:2|0:2:8|And not far from Old Zhang, a tall man was squatting on the ground, twisting the screws on the machine.
0:2:8|0:2:11|At last, it's time to get off work.
0:2:11|0:2:15|Outside the factory, people crowded towards the bus that had just arrived at the station.
0:2:15|0:2:24|The young woman in the queue was about to board the bus when, in the next second, she was forcefully cut in front of by someone from a diagonal angle and stepped onto the last available spot on the bus step.
0:2:26|0:2:31|The woman took a closer look and realized that the person was none other than the tall man.
0:2:31|0:2:42|Whether intentional or coincidental, in the days that followed, the young woman would always brush past the tall man in various corners of the factory.
0:2:42|0:2:47|In the deep winter, a tram slowly stops on the desolate old streets of Shanghai.
0:2:47|0:2:51|Even though wearing heavy cotton coats, the passengers were still bent over by the cold wind blowing in their faces.
0:2:53|0:2:56|Another new passenger boards the tram, and the tram starts again.
0:3:4|0:3:6|One day, Gu Manzhen, Xu Shuhui, Shi Cuizhi, and Zhang Yujin were all present.
0:3:8|0:3:14|The speaker is the tall man, sitting on the tram, looking towards the back of the car, lost in memories.
0:3:35|0:3:42|In a bustling restaurant, a young woman rests her chin on her hands, calmly listening to the conversation between the owner and her son.
0:3:42|0:3:48|Then she rubbed her hands together through the gloves and stared blankly at the cup in front of her.
0:3:53|0:3:58|After Gu Manzhen finished speaking, Xu Shuhui didn't seem angry, and then lifted the teapot.
0:4:24|0:4:31|[Gu Manzhen] then slightly stood up and pulled out three pairs of chopsticks from the chopstick holder in the middle of the table.
0:4:34|0:4:39|Then, [Gu Manzhen] placed the end of the chopsticks that could be eaten into the cup that had just been filled with tea.
0:5:20|0:5:25|The obscure [Shen Shijun] did not make a move, but instead lifted the cup with both hands.
0:5:45|0:5:52|[Shen Shijun], who had just poured the wine, smiled awkwardly, then picked up his chopsticks and shyly tasted the dishes on the table.
0:5:52|0:5:55|After dinner, the three of them walked into the rare winter sunshine.
0:6:25|0:6:31|Seeing [Gu Manzhen] smiling as she wiped away the dirt on her face, [Shen Shijun] suddenly felt at a loss.
0:6:53|0:7:1|Pass the camera to Shi Jun, said by Gu Manzhen.
0:7:1|0:7:4|Gu Manzhen could only bow her head and rummage through her bag for a comb.
0:7:14|0:7:27|Later, the three of them left a photo against the light.
0:7:27|0:7:30|Gu Manzhen pulled Xu Shuhui's arm and brought her in front of her.
0:7:52|0:7:58|[Shi Cuizhi] took a drag on her cigarette, took the camera from [Zhu Hongcai]'s hand, and gestured for him to come over.
0:8:14|0:8:19|[Shi Cuizhi] pressed the shutter twice.
0:8:19|0:8:25|Just as Gu Manzhen was feeling regretful, a drop of cold water fell on her face.
0:8:25|0:8:37|[Zhu Hongcai] first lowered his head to look at Manzhen's profile, then turned to look at the sky. The fine snowflakes began to dance, disturbing [Zhu Hongcai]'s heart and causing it to fluctuate gradually.
0:8:37|0:8:41|The letter that was supposed to be written was filled with Manzhen's name everywhere.
0:8:42|0:8:45|On the other side of the room, [Shi Cuizhi] slowly spoke.
0:9:13|0:9:17|Shi Cuizhi turns and walks towards the outside of the house.
0:9:17|0:9:20|Upon hearing Gu Manzhen's name, Shen Shijun unconsciously followed along.
0:9:45|0:9:49|[Shen Shijun] returned to the desk just before the book club was discovered.
0:10:8|0:10:12|In the middle of the night, a beam of light pierced through the trees and shone straight onto the path.
0:10:12|0:10:18|Approaching closer, a tall and thin figure was leaning forward searching for something on the roadside.
0:10:18|0:10:23|It turned out that [Shen Shijun] came to look for gloves after hearing the news.
0:10:23|0:10:29|Although wearing a coat and a scarf, the cold wind in Shanghai still made [Gu Manzhen] couldn't help but sneeze several times.
0:10:35|0:10:41|The next morning, [Shen Shijun] sat awkwardly in the book club with a newspaper in his hand.
0:10:41|0:10:47|And right in front of him was [Gu Manzhen], who called yesterday to say she had lost her gloves.
0:10:55|0:11:1|Shuhui didn't have time to think about why [Shen Shijun] was sitting in his seat, he picked up the pen on the table and walked out.
0:11:4|0:11:20|[Gu Manzhen] interrupted [Shen Shijun] as he was reaching into his pocket with a single sentence.
0:11:20|0:11:27|Gu Manzhen was about to drape a sweater with one shoulder missing over Shi Cuizhi's back when her action was interrupted, so she had to stop.
0:11:30|0:11:36|Unexpectedly, when Manzhen returned, [Shi Jun] was still sitting in the position of the book club.
0:11:46|0:11:49|[Shi Jun] gave Gu Manzhen an awkward smile and then turned around and left.
0:11:52|0:12:0|Shuhui asked the blind colleague for a glass of water, while Manzhen leaned against the table, smiling as she watched Yujin walk away.
0:12:32|0:12:39|In front of the mirror, a woman with thick lips and blush on her cheeks is adjusting her earrings.
0:12:39|0:12:45|Upon closer inspection, there is a slight resemblance between the young lady's features and [Gu Manzhen].
0:12:45|0:12:50|Gu Manzhen was lying on the bed, looking pale and sickly.
0:12:50|0:12:52|It turns out the young lady is actually Gu Manzhen's sister.
0:12:53|0:13:9|She first touched Gu Manzhen's forehead, then gently moved her hand to her cheek.
0:13:9|0:13:18|[Gu Manzhen] leaned against the bed with one hand, and slowly extinguished the cigarette at her lips with the other.
0:13:39|0:13:50|The sister, who was puffing on a cigarette, heard Gu Manzhen's complaint, first swayed to get up, then propped her chin with her left hand, lightly flicked with her right hand, and flicked the cigarette ash into her palm.
0:13:54|0:13:59|Sister stood by the desk, smoking, looking at the photo pressed under the glass, and asked.
0:14:55|0:15:0|A few days later, [Gu Manzhen] returned to the restaurant with the unfinished sweater to meet Shijun again.
0:15:0|0:15:3|Not in a hurry to pick up the dishes, but took the lead in speaking.
0:16:57|0:17:2|[Gu Manzhen] smiled as she looked at the dishes just served on the table, and then started eating with great relish.
0:17:2|0:17:17|After a satisfying meal, [Gu Manzhen] stepped into the alley in front of her home.
0:17:24|0:17:27|It turns out that the person who came as a guest is [Zhu Hongcai].
0:17:32|0:17:37|Xu Shuhui's hair appeared exceptionally prominent under the strong light on the roof.
0:18:7|0:18:13|Manlu angrily slammed the phone against the wall, then quickly walked downstairs and rushed towards [Zhu Hongcai].
0:18:54|0:18:58|Halfway through, she put down the water glass, touched her face, and rushed to the dressing table.
0:19:10|0:19:14|[Zhu Hongcai] walked slowly up behind [Gu Manzhen], bending at the waist.
0:19:20|0:19:26|At this moment, [Gu Manzhen] yawned, holding a plate, and turned into the corridor from the narrow streets of the small town.
0:19:34|0:19:44|[Gu Manzhen] sat on the edge of the bed holding a plate of snacks, taking a bite.
0:19:44|0:19:49|Mom glanced disapprovingly at [Gu Manzhen], then continued to unpack the bedding.
0:20:31|0:20:34|Wan Lu stopped chewing, looking despondent.
0:20:47|0:20:50|Outside of a gunshot, [Gu Manlu] slowly opened her eyes on the bed.
0:21:0|0:21:3|Gu Manzhen lowered her gaze, her chest rising and falling unevenly.
0:21:10|0:21:19|Gu Manzhen tightened her lips and stood up, walking towards the door slowly. However, memories of her past with Zhang Yujin still lingered in her mind.
0:21:19|0:21:25|Late at night, Gu Manzhen helped Zhang Yujin walk towards the depths of the alley slowly, but the next second she was pushed away.
0:21:29|0:21:33|In the moonlight, [Gu Manzhen]'s delicate skin could be pierced by a gentle touch, tears welling up in her eyes.
0:21:40|0:21:44|The diseased long hair trembled slightly with the fluctuation of emotions.
0:21:44|0:21:46|Finally, she took a deep breath and said.
0:21:48|0:21:55|Watching [Zhang Yujin] sulking on the edge of the stage, [Gu Manzhen] held back her tears, turned around without looking back, and left.
0:21:56|0:22:3|[Zhang Yujin] reluctantly took off her glasses, the still wet bloodstains dripping down her shaved chin.
0:22:3|0:22:7|As for the farewell to [Gu Manzhen], in the end, not a single word was spoken.
0:22:7|0:22:11|The memory ended, [Gu Manlu] slowly detached herself from the past.
0:22:12|0:22:17|To the sound of drums, melodious singing voices drifted out from elegantly decorated private rooms.
0:22:17|0:22:24|The boss was already sitting in a corner of the sofa, lightly tapping his thigh along with the melody.
0:22:24|0:22:31|At this moment, [Zhu Hongcai] opens the door in the corridor.
0:22:34|0:22:41|Just as she entered the private room, her lips, which had been slightly upturned, suddenly twitched slightly. She pretended not to see the woman in the room and sat on the sofa, swaying her skirt.
0:22:50|0:22:57|Being called out by Manager [Wang] in the middle of writing a letter, [Zhu Hongcai] had to bow and sit back at the table.
0:22:57|0:23:4|At this moment, the dancer next to [Mr. Wang] laughed and leaned on his shoulder, while [Gu Manzhen] stood up.
0:23:4|0:23:9|As soon as [Mr. Wang] saw [Gu Manzhen], the smile on his face disappeared.
0:23:24|0:23:28|[Gu Manzhen]'s hand holding the teacup awkwardly fell in the air.
0:23:28|0:23:31|Zhu Hongcai has been keeping an eye on Gu Manlu.
0:23:46|0:24:3|Seeing that [Mr. Wang] completely ignored her, [Gu Manzhen] stood up and left in a huff.
0:24:3|0:24:6|[Gu Manzhen] draped the fur coat over her shoulders and sat back heavily next to [Mr. Wang].
0:24:8|0:24:17|Late at night, in the quiet and desolate alley, two yellow cabs slowly turned into the intersection, with dim lights shining on the drivers.
0:24:17|0:24:26|In front of an iron gate, the two of them stopped in their tracks.
0:24:26|0:24:30|[Gu Manzhen] stood by the door and called out to [Xu Shuhui] who was about to leave.
0:24:37|0:24:43|Shijun stood behind [Gu Manzhen] quietly, watching her.
0:25:1|0:25:8|Shi Cuizhi came to the iron gate with a smile, took out the key, and slowly unwound the chain in circles.
0:25:8|0:25:15|[Gu Manzhen] didn't deliberately turn around, her hands that were originally placed in front of her also gently dropped after Shi Baibai opened the door.
0:25:15|0:25:21|Unable to resist any longer, Gu Manzhen took a few steps and finally turned back to look behind her.
0:25:33|0:25:48|A few days later, late at night, the wealthy lady complained while watering the flowers in the attic, while [Xu Shuhui] hurriedly ran down the stairs with gloves in hand.
0:26:43|0:26:51|Beside her, Xu Shuhui was busy as soon as Gu Manzhen entered the room. Upon hearing Shuhui's mother's instructions, she led her to her own room.
0:26:57|0:27:0|Shijun picked up a cup of hot water from the bedside and walked towards [Gu Manzhen].
0:27:12|0:27:14|The next day, Shijun returned to the station on the train.
0:27:33|0:27:43|[Gu Manzhen] was arranging the snacks she brought, while Shijun leaned in, intentionally or unintentionally, close to her ear.
0:27:43|0:27:52|This ambiguous situation momentarily left [Gu Manzhen] at a loss, so she had to speak up to break the tension.
0:28:6|0:28:10|Manzhen casually put the clothes that Shuhongcai had piled on the bed into the suitcase.
0:28:10|0:28:15|[Zhu Hongcai] gazed softly at his profile and sat down slowly on the edge of the bed.
0:28:15|0:28:24|Yesterday's memories ended, [Zhu Hongcai] sat in the yellow carriage with his packed luggage and Shuhui, heading towards home.
0:28:24|0:28:27|Walking through the narrow and bustling morning market, the two stopped in front of the house.
0:28:45|0:28:54|[Shi Jun] greeted and hurried back into the lobby.
0:29:7|0:29:10|In the evening, a large family sat around the table.
0:29:31|0:29:34|[Shi Cuizhi] took a few more glances at Shuhui, who looked somewhat out of place.
0:30:4|0:30:8|After dinner, [Zhu Hongcai] and [Shi Cuizhi] went out together as arranged by their mother.
0:30:15|0:30:21|Sitting together in the back of the carriage, they accidentally bumped shoulders and both awkwardly shrunk back.
0:30:21|0:30:26|Shuhui sat side by side with the coachman, holding the reins on one side.
0:30:26|0:30:32|After passing through an archway, the carriage headed towards an exquisite Western-style mansion.
0:30:32|0:30:39|The carved window was illuminated by the round glass lamp, reflecting a warm light.
0:30:39|0:30:41|Hearing the sound, the butler quickly stepped out.
0:30:54|0:31:8|Shuhui bid farewell to [Shi Cuizhi], but as soon as she entered, she couldn't help but tease Shijun.
0:31:8|0:31:23|Xu Shuhui looked up at the exquisite small building in front of her, laughed and sat in the back of the carriage. The next day, the three of them walked side by side in the winter park.
0:31:23|0:31:34|Shuhui walked between Gu Manzhen and Yujin, holding chestnuts, but the next moment one was taken by Cuizhi.
0:31:34|0:31:38|As they spoke, the two men gradually stood side by side, ending up behind [Shi Cuizhi].
0:31:38|0:31:40|They then stopped in front of the wooden boat by the lake.
0:31:50|0:31:55|Swaying unsteadily, [Shi Cuizhi] had just turned around when she hunched down into a ball.
0:32:18|0:32:28|As the only person who did not board the ship, Shijun turned around without saying a word and ran towards the park, and Shuhui had to help [Shi Cuizhi] into the cabin.
0:32:28|0:32:36|The winter park was somewhat deserted, and the trees planted by the lake were covered in thick frost in the rainy weather.
0:32:36|0:32:39|On the lake, there were only Xu Shuhui rowing with both oars and Shi Cuizhi sitting opposite her.
0:32:41|0:32:48|Perhaps the long silence made [Shi Cuizhi] feel a bit awkward, so she raised her hand and pointed to the distance.
0:32:55|0:32:58|[Xu Shuhui] smiled and then lifted both feet.
0:33:4|0:33:9|Seeing [Shi Cuizhi] shyly lower her head, [Xu Shuhui] quickly rummaged through his pockets.
0:33:10|0:33:17|First, she placed the uneaten chestnuts on the side, then lit another cigarette and put it in her mouth.
0:33:17|0:33:23|Sitting across from her, [Shi Cuizhi] leaned forward and took the bag of chestnuts into her hands.
0:33:23|0:33:29|Xu Shuhui intended to pass it over, but was a step too slow, so she awkwardly pulled back the hand holding the cigarette pack.
0:33:31|0:33:44|[Shi Cuizhi] peeled chestnuts while teasingly looking at [Xu Shuhui], who kept searching for a lighter in her pockets. She searched through pockets of all sizes, but still couldn't find it.
0:33:44|0:33:54|[Xu Shuhui] sneakily glanced at [Shi Cuizhi], then put the cigarette back into the box, and casually turned his head to look into the distance.
0:33:54|0:33:59|Shi Cuizhi smiled knowingly, about to continue shelling, when she heard a crisp whistle.
0:34:10|0:34:15|Every two days, Gu Hongcai and Xu Shuhui boarded the train to the Hui Xiang Tower.
0:34:15|0:34:21|In the bumpy carriage, [Zhu Hongcai] took out his wallet and pulled out the photo of him and [Gu Manzhen] in the park, looking at it over and over again.
0:34:47|0:34:51|Zhao Hongcai prepared a few small gifts and sent them to Gu Manzhen's home.
0:35:6|0:35:11|Gu Manzhen's mother hurriedly swept the floor.
0:35:37|0:35:43|[Zhu Hongcai] bowed to [Gu Manzhen]'s mother in gratitude, then walked straight to [Gu Manzhen]'s room.
0:35:43|0:35:47|The warm night light on the desk led Gu Manzhen to approach unconsciously.
0:35:47|0:35:54|He first looked down at the photo frame on the table, then picked up a sketchbook and flipped through it casually.
0:35:54|0:36:4|Continuing to put down the album, he was about to walk towards the other side of the bookshelf, but the moonlight outside the window stopped his steps.
0:36:4|0:36:6|With a turn of her head, [Gu Manzhen] walked into the room.
0:37:28|0:37:36|Gu Manzhen's two younger brothers stood by the stove with a mischievous smile on their faces, then dug out half a piece of salt and melted it into the soup, stirring it casually.
0:37:43|0:37:49|Manzhen's mother was completely unaware of the children's mischief and let [Shen Shijun] drink that bowl of soup.
0:37:49|0:37:55|[Shen Shijun]'s originally raised corners of the mouth started to tremble uncontrollably after taking a big sip.
0:38:1|0:38:7|[Shen Shijun] smiled faintly as he held the bowl, not exposing the children's prank.
0:38:7|0:38:10|After dinner, he and Gu Manzhen walked to the bustling street.
0:38:19|0:38:26|Manzhen tightened the scarf around her waist upon hearing this, then couldn't help but burst into laughter, followed by a glance at [Shen Shijun].
0:38:35|0:38:44|Shi Jun stood still and grabbed Gu Manzhen's left hand wrapped in a scarf, raised it to his chest, gently pinched it, and then took another step forward.
0:38:44|0:38:52|Gu Manzhen looked back nervously towards her home, then allowed Shuhui to lead her slowly forward.
0:38:52|0:39:3|At this moment, Xu Shuhui spoke as the two strolled leisurely under the moonlight.
0:39:7|0:39:13|Manzhen looked up at [Shen Shijun] and smiled before speaking playfully.
0:39:13|0:39:18|Shijun tightly held the intertwined hands of the two, lowered his head and looked deeply at [Gu Manzhen].
0:39:35|0:39:40|In front of the dim courtyard, Gu Manzhen stopped in her tracks, but Shijun didn't let go.
0:39:41|0:39:47|Saying that, Shijun turned on his heel and pulled [Gu Manzhen] back onto the path they had come.
0:39:47|0:39:50|Trailing by half a body length, [Gu Manzhen] softly spoke.
0:40:11|0:40:22|Gu Manzhen looked down at Shijun's wrist, about to turn back towards home, but her left hand was still tightly held in front of her by Shijun.
0:40:22|0:40:28|The two stood facing each other, then Shijun let go of Manzhen's hand and took out two books from his pocket to hand to [Gu Manzhen].
0:40:29|0:40:34|[Gu Manzhen] took it with a smile and then quickly ran towards home.
0:40:34|0:40:48|Shi Jun, without a mind of his own, followed [Gu Manzhen] closely, reluctant to part with her. It was only when she entered the room that he shifted his gaze, and the faint sorrow suddenly washed over Shi Jun's heart as he could no longer see her figure.
0:40:48|0:40:57|Standing in front of the gate of Gu Manzhen's house, he looked at his shadow projected on the wall for a few seconds, then turned and walked towards the depths of the alley.
0:40:58|0:41:5|The dim alley was quiet, reflecting the happiness of the two just now, as if it were a dream.
0:41:5|0:41:9|The bustling intersection was not far away.
0:41:9|0:41:15|Outside the house hung with lanterns, a wealthy family was gathered together, listening to the melodious opera.
0:41:15|0:41:19|The melody drifted into [Zhu Hongcai]'s ears, once again arousing his joyful mood.
0:41:21|0:41:31|Even on a cold winter night with chilling winds, recalling the moments just now, [Shen Shijun] couldn't help but stop in his tracks, leaning against the wall with his eyes closed, savoring the memories.
0:41:31|0:41:39|The dim light shone on his perfectly groomed hair, and his sword-like eyebrows appeared even more beautiful due to the gentle and exceptional demeanor.
0:41:39|0:41:43|Suddenly, the sound of a tram came from the end of the alley.
0:41:43|0:41:49|Sitting by the window, [Shen Shijun] turned back to look at the place where he had once lingered, his heart heavy as he lowered his head.
0:41:51|0:41:59|Years have passed, the once handsome young man now wears glasses, a sharp suit paired with a knee-length coat, highlighting his tall figure.
0:42:18|0:42:25|[Gu Manzhen] is led by the servant Ah Bao into a garden villa, and then into [Gu Manlu]'s bedroom.
0:43:4|0:43:7|A girl who looks about eight years old is skipping rope at the door.
0:43:39|0:43:45|Ma Dongmei sat up from the bed and carefully put the cheongsam into the bag.
0:44:11|0:44:14|[Zhao Hongcai] angrily walks up the stairs.
0:44:15|0:44:18|[Gu Manzhen] was about to go downstairs when she bumped into him.
0:44:36|0:44:39|Zhao Hongcai caught a cold and warmly invited Gu Manzhen.
0:45:4|0:45:7|[Zhu Hongcai] lay on the bed with a cigarette in hand.
0:46:15|0:46:21|[Zhu Hongcai] suddenly stood up, pushed [Gu Manlu] onto the bed, and then locked the door before leaving.
0:46:21|0:46:28|[Gu Manzhen] seemed to have lost all her strength, lying there with her head resting on her arm, staring wide-eyed in disbelief.
0:46:28|0:46:36|In the alley, [Gu Manzhen] carried the clean clothes and walked towards the rooftop, occasionally poking out half of her body as if she was anticipating something.
0:46:52|0:46:57|Ignoring the teasing from the neighbors, [Gu Manzhen] went to the rooftop to hang up the clothes.
0:47:16|0:47:20|Shijun stood eagerly by [Gu Manzhen]'s side.
0:47:33|0:47:36|Shijun handed the clothes hanger hanging on the cotton rope to [Gu Manzhen].
0:47:50|0:48:0|Wanting to confirm his words to the guard, the soldier intended to hang the socks on the hanger, but accidentally flung it to the ground.
0:48:0|0:48:3|[Gu Manzhen] smiled as she took the clothes hanger from the servant's hand.
0:48:28|0:48:32|Gu Manzhen remembered all the times when the Su family came to propose marriage.
0:48:32|0:48:38|It was still that autumn and winter, when Zhang Yujin turned into the alley of Gu Manzhen's home in the pouring rain.
0:48:38|0:48:40|Looking up, she just bumped into [Gu Manzhen] walking into the room.
0:48:44|0:48:47|Staring at the radiant and harmonious appearance of [Gu Manzhen], Zhang Yujing stood still in the distance.
0:49:27|0:49:32|Anyway, Manlu has already gotten married, so her room is now empty.
0:49:57|0:50:7|Although Zhang Yujin and [Gu Manzhen]'s mother chatted casually, when it came to [Gu Manlu], she couldn't help but lower her head, tightly gripping the teacup in her hand, lifting the corners of her mouth slightly, almost smiling.
0:50:7|0:50:14|The heavy rain outside the window kept falling, as if her emotions were being covered by a thick layer of sand.
0:50:14|0:50:19|Unable to avoid the enthusiasm of [Gu Manzhen]'s mother, Zhang Yujin nervously walked towards [Gu Manlu]'s former room.
0:50:20|0:50:28|Inside the room, there was only a dim table lamp, and a cool breeze blew in from the window, casting light on the neatly made bed.
0:50:44|0:50:47|Due to the dim light in the room, Zhang Yujin approached the corridor with a book in hand.
0:50:50|0:50:55|Grandma Manzhen, sitting in the living room picking beans, gently touched [Gu Manzhen]'s mother.
0:52:20|0:52:27|Seeing the evasive response from [Gu Manzhen]'s family, Shijun had no choice but to turn around and walk downstairs.
0:52:27|0:52:32|As Ke Gang turned the corner on the first floor, a casual glance made his face change drastically.
0:52:32|0:52:37|With the door wide open, [Gu Manzhen], assisted by [Zhang Yujin], is installing light bulbs on the roof.
0:52:37|0:52:42|Shi Jun saw this and rushed out the door directly.
0:52:42|0:52:46|Unaware, Gu Manzhen clapped her hands and stood back on the ground.
0:52:53|0:53:3|Gu Manzhen turned and walked towards the door upon hearing this.
0:53:3|0:53:7|Saying that, [Zhang Yujin] also walked to Manzhen's side.
0:53:7|0:53:11|At this moment, [Zhu Hongcai] braved the heavy rain and suddenly walked back into the house.
0:53:57|0:54:7|[Zhao Hongcai] accidentally knocked over the cup on the table, but noticed that Manzhen did not pick up her handkerchief after spilling the water, so he grabbed his umbrella and bid farewell to the two of them.
0:54:7|0:54:11|Passing by the room in the alley, [Gu Manzhen] couldn't help but take a peek inside.
0:54:29|0:54:33|In the store, Manzhen picked up the gloves and walked towards [Zhang Yujin].
0:54:48|0:54:51|The shop owner picked up a new pair and handed it to [Gu Manzhen].
0:55:55|0:56:0|Manzhen gave a wry smile to [Zhang Yujin], then turned and walked out of the store.
0:56:13|0:56:15|[Gu Manlu] sat on the sofa, smoking, and asked.
0:57:4|0:57:9|[Gu Manlu] threw down the cigarette, stood up angrily, and leaned against the window.
0:57:46|0:57:51|On the other side, [Zhang Yujin], who had just returned from the store, was packing her luggage in the room.
0:57:51|0:57:55|The book that Gu Manzhen had sent to her to pass the time before was neatly placed in the box.
0:57:58|0:58:7|Without paying attention, the coin fell to the ground. [Zhang Yujin] was about to pick it up when she caught a glimpse of [Gu Manzhen] hurrying in from the doorway.
0:58:33|0:58:48|In the midst of conversation, the two had already stood in front of the bed where the luggage was placed, and [Gu Manzhen] picked up a book from it.
0:58:59|0:59:3|Seeing [Gu Manzhen] sitting on the bed with a book in hand, [Zhang Yujin] responded softly.
0:59:19|0:59:31|[Gu Manzhen], upon hearing these words, instantly bent down, tremblingly withdrew her hand that was reaching for the coin. Tears silently streamed down her face in a direction unseen by [Zhang Yujin].
0:59:31|0:59:38|[Zhang Yujin] only took a few glances at her back before turning around to continue packing up the luggage on the bed.
0:59:43|0:59:52|Night fell, [Gu Manzhen] stood on the corridor of the small attic, staring blankly, holding the gloves she bought in the afternoon in her hands.
1:0:21|1:0:26|In a small restaurant, [Xu Shuhui] watched as [Gu Manzhen] fiddled with her gloves, softly inquiring.
1:0:26|1:0:30|At work, at noon, [Shen Shijun] came to find [Xu Shuhui].
1:0:44|1:0:56|Shuhui teased Gu Manzhen by giving her an orange, and watched as she walked away angrily.
1:0:56|1:1:6|[Shi Jun] returned to the workshop and happened to see [Gu Manzhen] distributing a box of snacks.
1:1:6|1:1:12|Coincidentally, at this moment, [Gu Manzhen] looked up and saw [Shi Jun] walking towards her with his hands in his pockets.
1:1:13|1:1:16|Later, the two returned to [Gu Manzhen]'s office.
1:2:5|1:2:12|Gu Manzhen stood anxiously in the corridor, then smiled and hurried down the stairs the next second.
1:2:31|1:2:49|The joy of the reunion was quickly dispelled by the sudden news, but [Gu Manzhen] soon adjusted her mindset, raised the corners of her mouth, and walked back into the alley with [Shi Jun]. [Shi Jun] was carrying a hastily packed handbag, walking step by step beside him.
1:2:49|1:2:59|Soon, the two of them passed through the iron gate and arrived at the crowded corner. Seeing the worried look on Shi Jun's face, Gu Manzhen paused and hesitantly spoke.
1:3:2|1:3:21|The wind blew across [Shi Jun]'s thin face, leaving him speechless for a moment.
1:3:21|1:3:26|Every two steps, [Zhang Yujin] leisurely stopped, turned around, and looked down at [Gu Manzhen].
1:3:48|1:3:49|Shen Shijun is speaking while writing.
1:4:5|1:4:9|Shi Jun put away the pen, sequentially grabbed Gu Manzhen's hand and held it in front of his chest.
1:4:18|1:4:23|Shi Jun intended to say something more, but caught sight of the yellow cart on the side of the road and quickly walked towards it.
1:4:27|1:4:39|Picking up the suitcase again, [Shi Cuizhi] took three steps back and looked back at Gu Manzhen, then turned around resolutely and gradually left on a crowded and bustling small road by taking a yellow carriage.
1:4:39|1:4:49|[Gu Manzhen] unconsciously waved her hand and took a few steps forward until she saw the yellow cart disappear at the end of the road. Then she turned desolately and walked towards home.
1:4:50|1:4:55|At this moment, the bustling stalls on both sides of the street seemed completely unrelated to him.
1:4:55|1:5:0|In the winter night, only one figure stood out in the crowd, looking somewhat lonely.
1:5:0|1:5:10|The night was hazy, at the other end of the city, a loud rumble sounded, the locomotive emitted thick smoke, pulling away from the station with a string of carriages.
1:5:10|1:5:13|And as Gu Manzhen said, she seemed to express her feelings through her writing.
1:5:32|1:5:41|On the tangled railway tracks, two trains swiftly pass each other inside a tunnel, as a figure full of longing heads towards the factory.
1:5:41|1:5:52|Quietly bypassing the office door, Shijun tiptoed to put down the briefcase in his hand, then came behind [Gu Manzhen], peeked at the apricot branches on his desk, and scared [Gu Manzhen] who was sitting quietly into a big scream.
1:6:8|1:6:12|The assassin picked up the letter and played with it in circles, teasing [Gu Manzhen].
1:6:13|1:6:16|Shijun stood still, pinched [Gu Manzhen]'s arms, and brought her to the small restaurant.
1:6:40|1:6:45|It's strange, Dad's illness suddenly took a turn for the better.
1:6:46|1:6:49|The two sat at the table, looking at each other in silence.
1:6:49|1:6:57|[Gu Manzhen] was stunned by the sudden news, her limbs frozen, her mouth opening and closing several times without saying a word.
1:6:57|1:7:0|When Xu Shuhui made the decision to stay in Nanjing.
1:7:13|1:7:25|And I also promised to go back to Nanjing with him to meet his parents. On a sunny morning, [Gu Manzhen] accompanied Jun and Shuhui to Nanjing.
1:7:26|1:7:31|Ah, [Gu Manzhen] grumbled while packing her luggage.
1:8:28|1:8:33|Wearing an oiled head and sporting a goatee, the man quickly took [Shi Cuizhi] in his arms and said.
1:8:51|1:8:55|[Shi Cuizhi] listened to this, her eyes shifting back and forth between Xu Shuhui and [Gu Manzhen].
1:9:8|1:9:12|Shuhui and Yipeng greeted Gu Hongcai and continued to climb towards the artificial hill.
1:9:12|1:9:17|[Zhu Hongcai] smiled faintly and quickly walked back to Manzhen's side.
1:9:17|1:9:21|Shi Cuizhi's friend fell behind with her at the end of the line.
1:9:37|1:9:38|Shi Cuizhi is dressed in brown and joking around.
1:10:3|1:10:10|Walking along the long street towards the pavilion, Wan Zhen smiled defiantly, then took Zhu Hongcai's hand and continued walking up the mountain.
1:10:10|1:10:17|Not far from them, Xu Shuhui and [Shi Cuizhi] were sitting next to her brother's stone platform by the artificial hillside.
1:10:17|1:10:21|After tidying up, Shuhui gestured to the two of them to continue moving forward.
1:10:22|1:10:30|Seeing [Shi Cuizhi] slightly tired, bending over, Xu Shuhui gallantly lowered his right hand and led her up the long stone steps.
1:10:30|1:10:35|Shi Cuizhi hesitated for a moment, then smiled and got up to follow her pace.
1:10:35|1:10:44|In the park in the afternoon, with few people around, the warm sun shone on the two of them, dispelling a hint of goodwill.
1:10:44|1:10:47|On the other side, [Shen Shijun] pulled Manzhen to the high platform.
1:12:8|1:12:13|Yi Peng embraced [Shi Cuizhi]'s friend Wenxian, and they walked out of the gate of the Shijun's house together.
1:12:13|1:12:14|Xu Shuhui didn't say anything.
1:12:14|1:12:17|It was just a late night glance back at the two of them.
1:12:17|1:12:23|Xu Shuhui didn't turn around to head towards the attic until they disappeared in the courtyard.
1:12:23|1:12:28|She arrived at the second floor, paused her steps, and was about to rush downstairs but stopped herself.
1:12:28|1:12:34|Facing the window, a hint of moonlight suddenly flashed across [Xu Shuhui]'s face, upon closer inspection, it turned out to be a tear.
1:12:45|1:12:55|In the deep of the building, [Shen Shijun]'s mother pushed the door open and smiled at Shuhui, who had her back to her, inviting her to follow her into the room, then brought out a cup of tea.
1:13:30|1:13:36|Gu Manzhen happened to be carrying a teapot as she walked up from the first floor, and coincidentally overheard the gossip about herself.
1:13:45|1:13:49|In the room, without saying a word, [Gu Manzhen] took off the suit and draped it over Manzhen's shoulders.
1:13:52|1:14:1|Then, [Shen Shijun] took off the scarf from himself and carefully wrapped it around [Gu Manzhen]'s neck, then firmly held her shoulders from behind.
1:14:9|1:14:15|[Gu Manzhen] turned around and looked at [Shen Shijun] kneeling on one knee, holding out a gemstone ring.
1:14:15|1:14:19|[Gu Manzhen] saw this and carefully pinched it between her fingertips.
1:15:2|1:15:3|[Gu Manzhen] has already gotten up.
1:15:11|1:15:15|[Gu Manzhen] walked into the living room carrying a water kettle.
1:15:15|1:15:19|Seeing [Gu Manzhen] wake up, her grandmother took care of [Shen Shijun] and led him into the room to sit down.
1:15:24|1:15:32|Before long, [Gu Manzhen] returned to the room.
1:15:32|1:15:34|[Shen Shijun] stood by the small balcony, rubbing his coat.
1:15:36|1:15:40|The chair in front of the desk where Gu Manzhen sat was facing Shen Shijun.
1:15:49|1:15:52|[Gu Manzhen] adjusted her hair in front of the mirror.
1:15:54|1:15:58|[Shen Shijun] leaned against the door frame with his hands in his pockets.
1:16:2|1:16:7|[Gu Manzhen] lightly rubbed her fingers and then looked up at [Shen Shijun].
1:16:7|1:16:8|[Shen Shijun] turned his head.
1:16:15|1:16:18|[Shen Shijun] strode into the room and sat on the bed.
1:16:35|1:16:39|[Gu Manzhen] stood up with a smile and walked slowly to the bookshelf.
1:16:46|1:16:48|[Shen Shijun] came to sit down behind [Gu Manzhen].
1:17:4|1:17:10|Bending slightly, [Zhu Hongcai] rested his hands on his knees, rubbing them together quietly in response to [Zhang Yujin].
1:17:33|1:17:36|Before [Gu Manzhen] could finish speaking, [Shen Shijun] had already left the spot.
1:17:58|1:18:12|Gu Manzhen finally managed to dig out the glove from the box, but then she put it back heavily. She sat back on the edge of the bed, took off the ring from her left hand, and handed it to Shi Shijun beside her.
1:18:12|1:18:18|Perhaps holding her breath, [Gu Manzhen]'s left hand, extended, rose and fell with her breathing.
1:18:18|1:18:26|Shen Shijun, who was two punches away from him, was also incredulous for a moment, gripping the edge of the bed tightly with both hands, then turning his head in astonishment to look at Manzhen.
1:18:27|1:18:36|Taking a deep breath, [Shen Shijun] slowly raised his hand, took the ring handed by Manzhen, and tightly held it with both hands, bowing his head with a solemn expression.
1:18:36|1:18:41|The next moment, he placed the ring back on the bed, picked up his coat, and without looking back, left the room.
1:18:41|1:18:41|On the other side, the home of [Gu Manzhen].
1:18:57|1:19:0|Gu Manzhen and her mother were led to Manlu's bedside by the servant.
1:20:17|1:20:18|Not only was Mom and Manlu talking, Manzhen gritted her teeth, stood up, and angrily stormed out of the room.
1:20:18|1:20:19|After a while, [Gu Manzhen]'s mother came out and, just as she turned the corner, she saw [Gu Manzhen] sitting at the door.
1:21:11|1:21:18|Seeing Gu Manzhen nod slightly, Gu Manzhen's mother hugged her body, supported her waist with one hand, and sighed as she walked out of the door.
1:21:18|1:21:25|Gu Manzhen stood up, tightened the hands that were unconsciously pushed away, and then walked towards the window.
1:21:25|1:21:30|Although the weather hasn't warmed up yet, the scenery in the small garden outside the window is well taken care of.
1:21:31|1:21:37|The two sisters who had quarreled remained at an impasse until nightfall.
1:21:37|1:21:42|Manlu was sitting on the small sofa smoking, when she heard the sound of a car stopping outside the window.
1:21:44|1:21:48|He stood up abruptly and leaned against the window, staring fixedly at the person outside the house.
1:21:53|1:21:58|Through the smoke, it seemed as if his once gentle gaze was gradually turning fierce.
1:21:58|1:22:6|Before long, [Zhu Hongcai] staggered in with his hat askew, leaning against the wall.
1:22:6|1:22:7|Then he patted the birdcage.
1:22:13|1:22:24|Next, he rudely tore open the door of the birdcage, and the parrot, named Jianzi, hopped onto the fence, flapped its wings, bumped into his hand, and then fell back to the bottom of the cage. It then suddenly darted out of the birdcage and escaped.
1:22:26|1:22:34|At this moment, [Gu Manlu] approached [Zhu Hongcai], glanced at the room where [Gu Manzhen] was upstairs, frowned, and a cold light flashed in her eyes.
1:22:34|1:22:46|And [Zhu Hongcai], as if receiving some instructions, excitedly rushed towards [Gu Manzhen]'s room like a raging river, twisting his body and grabbing the handrail of the stairs.
1:22:46|1:23:1|[Gu Manzhen], who was originally sound asleep, suddenly woke up at this moment. The moonlight dimmed, and in her struggle with [Zhu Hongcai], she accidentally shattered the glass by the window. Clearly not as strong as a man, the next moment, [Gu Manzhen] found her hands being held and someone mounting her from behind.
1:23:1|1:23:7|Wearing a long nightgown made it even easier for the person behind to rudely push her.
1:23:7|1:23:18|Downstairs, the parrots fluttered their wings in panic, flying around the enclosed circular staircase like headless flies. [Gu Manlu] remained indifferent, only lifting her head to look towards [Gu Manzhen]'s room.
1:23:20|1:23:28|Before long, the sounds of the scuffle upstairs gradually faded away, and [Gu Manzhen] spent the cold night like this, finally welcoming the arrival of the second day.
1:24:13|1:24:18|[Gu Hongcai] smiled instantly, came to the dressing table and used a tissue to wipe the wound.
1:24:26|1:24:28|After hearing these words, [Zhu Hongcai] tightened his robe and squatted beside [Gu Manlu].
1:24:28|1:24:31|[Zhu Hongcai] leaned over [Gu Manlu]'s knees with one hand, and ate the porridge she handed him in big mouthfuls.
1:24:31|1:24:32|On the other side, [Gu Manzhen] curled up into a ball, absentmindedly hugging herself.
1:25:33|1:25:35|Manlu takes the broken glass from [Gu Manzhen]'s hand.
1:25:53|1:26:5|Gu Manzhen suddenly waved her hand, pushing Gu Manlu and Shen Shijun towards the tea table behind.
1:26:5|1:26:8|Hearing the noise, the maid quickly entered the room.
1:26:17|1:26:29|Manzhen was speechless for a moment, and as soon as she saw the door open, she rushed towards it, but the next second she was overturned by [Gu Manlu] to the ground.
1:26:29|1:26:36|[Gu Manzhen] pointed fiercely at Manzhen, then turned and walked out of the room with the maid. Manzhen scrambled to the door.
1:26:53|1:26:57|On the other side, [Zhu Hongcai], who had parted ways with Gu Manzhen, returned to Nanjing.
1:26:57|1:27:3|Sitting on the edge of the bed, Gu Manzhen looked at her seriously ill father leaning against her mother, and lost her focus.
1:27:3|1:27:10|Then I saw my father struggling, using his last bit of consciousness to gesture with his hands, as if he was trying to convey something.
1:27:10|1:27:14|In the blink of an eye, the night sky was scattered with a few ice crystals falling gently.
1:27:30|1:27:37|At the desk, [Zhu Hongcai] slowly capped the pen and looked at the fluttering snow outside the window, his thoughts drifting far away.
1:27:37|1:27:45|In the villa at this moment, Gu Manzhen sat helplessly at the head of the bed, unconsciously feeling the ring on her right ring finger.
1:27:45|1:27:54|The previously broken window has been firmly nailed shut, and outside the window, although the sun was shining warmly, it could not brighten Manzhen's gloomy heart.
1:27:54|1:27:56|At this moment, the maid walked in carrying the food.
1:28:26|1:28:32|Gu Manzhen forcefully stuffed the ring in her hand into the maid's hand, and then pushed it out of the room.
1:28:32|1:28:47|The maid, holding the ring, had just walked down the stairs for a few steps when she caught sight of the open door ahead. She turned around, raised a smile, and quickly walked into the room.
1:28:57|1:29:3|The Shi family pushed their father in a wheelchair onto the street.
1:29:3|1:29:10|Fu Xia tightened the blanket around her father, while the Market Military Alliance arrived at the telephone booth outside the Manzhen family's home.
1:29:15|1:29:35|Everyone is carrying their luggage and saying goodbye in the alley. Upstairs, the phone keeps ringing on the wall. Manzhen's mother is about to go upstairs to answer it, but is interrupted the next second.
1:29:35|1:29:39|The door was completely closed, and [Gu Manzhen]'s family moved away from the original place like this.
1:29:40|1:29:53|Long-unseen light seeped through the cracks of the alley door, now covered in moss. In the dim and damp environment, the paint on the wooden house's exterior had long peeled off. The only place in the square courtyard that could see light was the small path beneath the empty well.
1:29:53|1:29:59|Walking into the cabin, the first thing that catches the eye is the cluttered wooden shelves and a few wooden basins that have not been cleaned up.
1:29:59|1:30:6|In the alley outside the house, [Shi Jun] paced back and forth with his hands in front of him, and the next second, an old man approached.
1:30:19|1:30:34|After the old man finished speaking, he slowly walked out of the alley with the vegetables in hand. [Shi Jun], who had been waiting anxiously beside him, also put his hands back into his coat pockets, then leaned back against the wall, looking up at the place he had visited many times before.
1:30:34|1:30:37|On the other side, [Zhu Hongcai] walked into the room with a bowl.
1:30:40|1:30:48|Placing the box in his hand on the ground, he smiled and handed the bowl to [Gu Manzhen] sitting by the window.
1:30:48|1:30:54|Gu Manzhen just sat on the lounge chair, looking out the window, ignoring his words.
1:30:54|1:31:2|Mr. Zhu pursed his lips at this, turned around and gently placed the bowl on the bedside table, then carefully spoke.
1:31:6|1:31:13|Then he slowly took a few steps back, only to stop at the door before turning his gaze and walking out of the room.
1:31:39|1:31:50|Shen Shijun sat on the sofa, greeting [Gu Manzhen].
1:31:51|1:31:58|Shen Shijun took out a handkerchief, handed something to Shi Jun, and slowly lit a cigarette from the table.
1:32:24|1:32:29|[Gu Manlu] lowered her head so that Shijun couldn't see her evasive eyes.
1:32:29|1:32:38|Upstairs, [Gu Manzhen] slowly opened the box that had just been closed. Among the stacked luggage of coats, a pair of gloves that had not been given away stood out conspicuously.
1:32:38|1:32:49|She first gently touched it, then carefully held it in her hand. Her breathing, which was originally calm, suddenly became rapid. Her knees weakened, and she fell back, sitting on the edge of the bed.
1:32:50|1:32:59|And what he didn't know was that, in just a few short seconds, [Shi Jun] had already put on his coat, bid farewell to [Manlu], and walked into the small garden.
1:32:59|1:33:11|If [Gu Manzhen] were to glance out the window at this moment, even just a blurry figure, she would recognize that it is the lover she has longed for, her only hope.
1:33:11|1:33:13|Fate played a joke on this couple like this.
1:33:15|1:33:21|While Gu Manzhen was secretly feeling sad, Shi Cuizhi completely walked out of the garden, leaving this place of heartbreak.
1:33:21|1:33:27|On a cold and damp morning, a small boat cut through the thick fog and moved forward.
1:33:27|1:33:31|The boatman at the bow was strenuously pushing a bamboo pole to determine the direction.
1:33:31|1:33:43|A coffin covered with cotton cloth stood in the middle of the cabin, the cold wind blowing from the river causing its tail to sway uncontrollably. [Shi Jun]'s mother had to firmly hold on to both sides, reluctantly separating from the servant.
1:33:44|1:34:4|[Gu Manzhen] stood silently by the side of the boat, staring straight at the churning river water. Then she suddenly raised the handkerchief she had been holding tightly to her chest, took a moment to think, and slowly pulled out the ring from it. She lowered her head to examine it closely, then, as if gathering courage, she looked towards the river just within reach.
1:34:4|1:34:7|She threw the ring down without any hesitation.
1:34:10|1:34:14|In the blink of an eye, the once cherished token of love disappeared without a trace.
1:34:14|1:34:21|Shi Jun's face appeared very calm, but the trembling of his throat exposed his true feelings.
1:34:21|1:34:28|Finally, he returned to his family without any attachment, using one hand to support the coffin as it slowly drifted down the river.
1:34:29|1:34:35|By the river, layers of withered reed leaves swayed freely in the wind and frost.
1:34:35|1:34:44|A gust of cold wind blew in, tearing the thick fog that had obscured everything into many pieces, but as the small boat passed by, it all gathered back together.
1:34:44|1:34:48|Time passes, and an old man with a face full of wrinkles limps into the alleyway.
1:35:8|1:35:15|The man who entered the cabin is the husband of [Jin Fang].
1:36:2|1:36:26|Gu Manzhen finally gave birth to a child. Dressed in a sharp suit, Xu Shuhui posed for photos with the newlyweds in the luxurious Golden Beauty Hotel.
1:36:26|1:36:27|Discovered a heartbroken person when she turned around.
1:36:48|1:36:57|With his back to the crowd, Shuhui handed a handkerchief to the sobbing [Shi Cuizhi], while Manzhen took out a piece of paper in the dimly lit room and wrote down the name Shuhui stroke by stroke.
1:37:13|1:37:18|Before long, the letter carrying [Gu Manzhen]'s inner thoughts drifted to [Shen Shijun]'s house.
1:37:26|1:37:31|[Shen Shijun]'s mother picked up the letter spread out on the table, looked at it for a moment, and then threw it back down.
1:37:34|1:37:43|[Xu Shuhui] nodded in agreement, then picked up the letter and envelope, turned around, and threw them into the fireplace at her feet.
1:37:43|1:37:50|Filled with endless thoughts of longing, after the last glimmer passed by, they also disappeared along with the ashes.
1:37:50|1:37:53|The long-awaited happy day for [Shen Shijun] and [Shi Cuizhi] has arrived.
1:38:46|1:38:53|[Zhu Hongcai] forced a smile, put down the satisfied wine glass, then grabbed [Shi Cuizhi]'s hand and firmly placed it on [Shen Shijun]'s hand.
1:38:53|1:38:57|[Shi Cuizhi] looked at him in astonishment, but eventually her eyes avoided his gaze and she lowered her head.
1:38:59|1:39:19|At the banquet, [Zhang Yujin] changed out of her half-male attire and walked in the cold rainy night. The cigarette burning at her fingertips became the only source of light on the street. The alcohol she had consumed now soaked her whole body. Her legs mechanically moved forward, staggering to avoid the oncoming carriage, which helped her regain a slight sense of sobriety.
1:39:19|1:39:26|She flicked the cigarette away, gathered the scattered hair hanging in front of the goose with both hands, then raised her eyes again, transforming back into the appearance of a dashing young man.
1:39:30|1:39:38|At the same time, [Gu Manzhen], after taking care of her body, walked into the alley of [Xu Shuhui]'s house with a scarf around her neck and a bag of pastries.
1:39:38|1:39:46|Approaching the destination, she suddenly stopped in front of the warm light on the steps, took a deep breath, and then continued walking forward.
1:40:14|1:40:18|Returning to [Gu Manzhen], she stopped her needlework and asked softly.
1:41:4|1:41:5|Shen Shijun said.
1:41:12|1:41:18|Shuhui's parents, realizing their mistake, saw Gu Manzhen holding back her emotions and quickly called her to eat vegetables.
1:41:18|1:41:22|After bidding farewell, [Gu Manzhen] went into the cinema alone.
1:41:22|1:41:26|On the screen, the exaggerated actions of the men and women dominated the audience.
1:41:26|1:41:33|[Gu Manlu] stared ahead without blinking, with mist swirling in her eyes, gradually unable to see the scene in front of her.
1:41:33|1:41:37|The next moment, she suddenly raised the corners of her mouth, tears sliding down her face like broken beads.
1:41:38|1:41:43|Organizing her emotions, [Gu Manlu] strode to the alley where she used to live.
1:41:43|1:41:48|The once tidy alley, now after some demolition, has become impassable.
1:41:48|1:41:55|The bricks, stones, and tiles casually discarded by the roadside unexpectedly became a place for people to gather around and chat by the fire.
1:41:55|1:41:59|Pushing through the crowd, [Gu Manzhen] caught a glimpse of a sharply dressed man and hurried to catch up with him.
1:42:32|1:42:39|The moment of joy was blown away, [Gu Manzhen] walked out of the alley with her head down in the sudden snowstorm.
1:43:21|1:43:26|Autumn comes and winter goes, another year has passed. Now, [Gu Manzhen] has become a teacher.
1:43:26|1:43:34|[Gu Manzhen] has changed her previous decadent appearance. Although dressed very simply, when teaching, her whole person shines with radiance.
1:43:34|1:43:39|Back in the simple dormitory, [Gu Manzhen] was boiling water.
1:43:39|1:43:44|He was originally using pliers to turn the stove, but stopped when he saw the newcomer.
1:43:50|1:43:54|[Gu Manlu] walked slowly with the support of two maids.
1:43:54|1:44:6|Although it was winter, she wore much thicker clothes than adults, and after brushing past [Gu Manzhen] with drooping eyelids, she leaned against the head of the bed with the help of the maid, as if she had shed tears.
1:44:9|1:44:14|During this time, [Gu Manzhen] was busy tending to the stove.
1:44:28|1:44:37|Gu Manzhen turned around, walked to the table, took out a cup and poured a glass of water, then she took out a photo.
1:44:58|1:45:2|Manzhen didn't look at the photo handed over slowly by [Gu Manlu].
1:45:2|1:45:7|After pouring another glass of water, she sat down next to [Gu Manzhen] with two cups in hand.
1:45:7|1:45:11|[Gu Manlu] took a look and then took the water handed to her the next second.
1:45:11|1:45:14|Then Gu Manzhen watched as the photo was taken away, lowering her head to take a look.
1:45:42|1:45:47|Holding the photo in her hand again, [Gu Manlu] took a sip of water and couldn't help but start coughing.
1:45:48|1:46:5|Manzhen immediately stood up when she saw this, took the water glass, then took the towel and squatted in front of [Gu Manlu], patting her back and wiping the water off her chest.
1:46:5|1:46:11|[Gu Manlu] pulled the bracelet from her wrist and struggled to sit up, leaning against Manzhen.
1:46:11|1:46:14|Seeing her so determined, [Gu Manzhen] also softened her attitude.
1:46:15|1:46:23|Following the address provided by [Gu Manzhen], Manzhen took a pedicab and turned into a narrow alley.
1:46:23|1:46:26|The old servant had been waiting at the door.
1:46:42|1:46:46|The old servant led [Gu Manzhen] to an open room on the second floor.
1:46:52|1:46:55|[Gu Manzhen] saw [Shi Cuizhi] working on her homework at the table.
1:46:55|1:47:5|Guided by [Shi Cuizhi], she took a step towards the depths of the room, where a bed occupied a third of the space, with a little boy hiding his face in the blanket.
1:47:27|1:47:30|The old servant placed the herbal medicine by the bedside and then left the room.
1:47:30|1:47:38|Although it was the first time [Gu Manzhen] met Rong Bao, she couldn't help but move her hand out of the covers and reach towards [Gu Manzhen].
1:47:38|1:47:40|Before long, [Zhu Hongcai] returned with vegetables.
1:47:42|1:47:48|Placing the basket on the wooden table by the door, she turned around and stood still.
1:47:48|1:47:59|[Gu Manzhen] wrung the towel dry from the basin and walked to Rongbao's bedside.
1:47:59|1:48:4|[Gu Manzhen] wiped the table without paying much attention.
1:48:4|1:48:9|Zhu Hongcai played with the water glass in Gu Manzhen's hand, so she had to quickly walk over to Rong Bao's side.
1:48:12|1:48:16|Mr. Zhu awkwardly spoke up as he looked at the uncomfortable Rongbao.
1:48:16|1:48:25|Gu Manzhen, however, paid no attention and went to the table with the photos of Manlu, continuing to tidy up.
1:48:25|1:48:28|Mr. Zhu had to walk out of the room and stood in the corridor, holding chopsticks and a bowl to detain them.
1:48:37|1:48:46|Before the fire was lit, Emperor Zhao picked up the bowl and gulped it down. Manzhen sat calmly on the side, glanced at him, and whispered to Shu Hui beside her.
1:48:46|1:48:51|Then she picked up a piece of meat with chopsticks and put it into Emperor Zhao's bowl.
1:48:51|1:49:0|Zhu Hongcai, who has been paying attention to Gu Manzhen, slowly puts down the chopsticks in his hand, picks up a spoon from the table, and scoops a spoonful of meat into Gu Manzhen's bowl.
1:49:3|1:49:10|Seeing Gu Hongcai's indifferent look, Manzhen hesitated for a moment, then continued to eat in small bites.
1:49:10|1:49:20|After dinner, Gu Manzhen found a corner to curl up and fall asleep on a lounge chair, while Xu Shuhui lay beside Rongbao, staring blankly at his sleeping face.
1:49:20|1:49:27|It was unbearable. Zhu Hongcai, wrapped in a coat, shivered as he got up and changed into another coat to put on.
1:49:30|1:49:34|But the noise soon woke up the already sick [Shen Shijun].
1:49:34|1:49:39|Gu Manzhen quickly picked up the towel next to the pillow and gently wiped his forehead.
1:49:39|1:49:44|Hearing the noise, [Zhu Hongcai] carefully lit the candle and hurried over to the two of them, holding his shoes.
1:49:44|1:49:45|[Zhu Hongcai] breathed a sigh of relief, bent down and placed the candle on the bedside table.
1:50:10|1:50:21|The cold wind blew through the cracks in the window into the room. In the flickering light, Gu Manzhen's sparse hair was particularly noticeable, but she just turned her head slightly after listening, lost in her own thoughts.
1:50:23|1:50:27|The next morning, the sunlight streamed through the window onto the bed.
1:50:33|1:50:39|Turning around immediately after realizing the sofa in the distance was gone the next second.
1:50:39|1:50:45|After putting on her shoes while sitting on the bed, Gu Manzhen looked up and noticed something unusual.
1:50:46|1:50:56|With narrowed eyes, [Gu Manzhen] glanced out the window, then stood up with her hands on the edge of the bed and slowly walked towards the dining table not far away.
1:50:56|1:51:8|On the shining dining table, there are stacked fried dough sticks and fried doughnuts in the plates, while a porcelain bowl is filled with soy milk. To keep it warm, a plate is even placed upside down on top at night.
1:51:30|1:51:35|Without refusing this kind gesture, [Gu Manzhen] picked up the fried dough sticks and soy milk and started eating.
1:51:35|1:51:39|Years have passed in the blink of an eye, and a busy dock is now lined with a ship.
1:51:51|1:52:4|[Xu Shuhui] was wearing a leather jacket, chewing gum, carrying a suitcase, and walked out of the crowded ship onto a small path. She stopped at the staircase, looked down, as if searching for someone.
1:52:30|1:52:41|[Shi Cuizhi] sent her daughter and younger son to [Xu Shuhui]'s parents, and then the five of them anxiously waited at the dock.
1:52:41|1:52:47|In the crowded hallway after class, Xu Shuhui's parents spotted the neatly dressed Shuhui from afar at a glance.
1:53:9|1:53:18|Bowing his head to see Da Bao and Er Bao holding balloons, [Zhu Hongcai] smiled and handed the luggage to Shi Jun, then picked up the two children, each taking one.
1:53:18|1:53:25|Laughing and joking, [Gu Manzhen], under her mother's pull, left the crowded crowd and strode towards the pier.
1:53:25|1:53:34|Behind the mother and son, not far away, [Zhu Hongcai]'s father and Shi Jun each held one of the bouncing twins, while [Shi Cuizhi] walked alone beside the eldest child.
1:53:36|1:53:41|Some time later, Gu Manzhen rummaged through the study, searching through boxes and cabinets.
1:53:41|1:53:46|The precious desk made of black wood is cluttered with various books.
1:53:46|1:53:52|The desk lamp cast a soft glow, with the wedding photo of [Shen Shijun] and [Shi Cuizhi] hanging high on the wall facing the door.
1:53:52|1:53:59|While Gu Manzhen was rummaging through the drawer, Shi Cuizhi led him to move the plants in the attic.
1:53:59|1:54:3|Suddenly, an envelope fell from the bottom of a thick book.
1:54:4|1:54:10|[Shen Shijun] picked it up and casually placed it on the desk.
1:54:21|1:54:25|[Shi Cuizhi] then turned around, walked into the bedroom, and took out a coat.
1:54:35|1:54:41|[Shi Cuizhi] rolled her eyes and then turned back to the bedroom.
1:54:41|1:54:43|[Shen Shijun] could only pocket the envelope and went downstairs.
1:55:4|1:55:14|Outside the two-story small western-style building, Gu Manzhen and Xu Shuhui are playing with the dog.
1:55:14|1:55:24|Watching the dog wagging its tail happily under his feeding, Dabao looked up and pleaded with [Shi Cuizhi] standing on the second-floor balcony.
1:55:24|1:55:30|And once [Shen Shijun] boarded the tram after leaving the house, he finally had the time to take out the letter from his coat pocket and read it carefully.
1:56:11|1:56:16|It turns out that this long-lost letter is from [Gu Manzhen].
1:56:16|1:56:25|After many years, seeing the familiar handwriting again, [Shen Shijun] was momentarily stunned, unconsciously finding himself dragging his heavy steps to the vicinity of the Shu family's bookstore.
1:56:26|1:56:30|Moonlight filtered through the sparse leaves, casting dappled patterns on the weathered stone wall.
1:56:30|1:56:35|Shen Shijun slowly sneaked into the alley, his gaze following the lush rockery towards the garden on the second floor of the Shuhui family.
1:56:37|1:56:43|He then walked through the gatehouse and headed towards the stairs. To his surprise, when he looked up, he saw Gu Manzhen coming down.
1:56:43|1:56:55|At that time, in the eyes of [Shen Shijun], [Gu Manzhen] seemed to have only one difference from her youth, which was the curly ends of her hair at the back of her neck, adding a touch of charm.
1:56:55|1:57:1|[Gu Manzhen] casually clenched her hands and walked up to [Shen Shijun] with a smile on her face.
1:57:12|1:57:13|The two turned and left, arriving at a restaurant.
1:57:28|1:57:35|As Shen Shijun entered, the waiter warmly greeted him and led them deeper inside.
1:57:35|1:57:41|Separated from the noisy lobby, the two entered a relatively quiet private room.
1:57:41|1:57:47|Shi Jun followed behind [Gu Manzhen], smiling and thanking the shopkeeper, then he took off his coat.
1:57:49|1:57:53|Then she walked around him and hung the clothes on the coat rack in the corner.
1:57:53|1:57:59|Next, Shi Jun took off his hat and scarf, gently draping them on top.
1:57:59|1:58:3|[Gu Manzhen] stood aside, silently watching everything.
1:58:3|1:58:6|The next moment, [Zhang Yujin] slowly turned around and walked towards him.
1:58:6|1:58:15|At this moment, [Gu Manzhen] could no longer suppress her emotions, burying her head into Shi Jun's shoulder and tightly wrapping her arms around him.
1:58:15|1:58:17|Shi Jun also took [Gu Manzhen] into his arms.
1:58:19|1:58:24|[Gu Manzhen] took a step back and raised her hand to touch Shi Shijun's cheek.
1:58:24|1:58:30|Shijun held Gu Manzhen's hand as if it were a precious treasure, pulling her close to his chest.
1:58:30|1:58:34|[Gu Manzhen] had a long scar on her wrist, catching Shijun's attention.
1:58:43|1:58:47|Gu Manzhen was about to continue speaking when she was interrupted by an incoming phone call.
1:58:47|1:58:52|At this moment, Gu Manzhen seemed to have lost the will to continue, she turned around and pulled out a chair to sit at the table.
1:59:4|1:59:8|[Xu Shuhui] raised his glass, while [Shi Cuizhi] took a sip beside him.
1:59:34|1:59:42|[Xu Shuhui] glanced at [Shi Cuizhi] sitting diagonally across from him, said nothing, just swirled the ice cubes in his glass, then [Shi Cuizhi] poured him another drink.
1:59:52|2:0:10|In the midst of conversation, [Xu Shuhui] raised the corners of his mouth, suddenly leaned in close to [Shi Cuizhi]'s forehead, then lifted his wine glass with a smile and stood up, slowly walking to the window.
2:0:30|2:0:35|[Xu Shuhui] unconsciously turned around and leaned against the edge of [Shi Cuizhi]'s sofa.
2:0:38|2:0:46|Looking up and to the side, [Shi Cuizhi] had a smile on her face as she leaned back against the back of the sofa.
2:0:46|2:0:48|[Xu Shuhui] took a deep breath and leaned in close to her.
2:0:50|2:0:53|With just a fist's distance between them, their foreheads were about to touch.
2:1:0|2:1:7|Xu Shuhui took a deep breath, propped herself up on the armrest of the sofa, stood up, and then sat back in her original position.
2:1:7|2:1:15|On one side, Shi Cuizhi raised her glass again, while in the restaurant across the street, Zhu Hongcai struck a match, lit a cigarette, and took a deep drag.
2:2:1|2:2:9|The food on the table had long gone cold, and [Shi Cuizhi], who knew the truth, sat there in silence, smoking her cigarette one after another.
2:2:9|2:2:14|The sound of footsteps going upstairs could be heard at the door of the stairs as they spoke.
2:2:28|2:2:37|The former small restaurant has now expanded its storefront, and the two silent figures seem to see some blooming flowers.
2:2:49|2:2:54|[Shen Shijun] adjusted his glasses and looked up at [Gu Manzhen] deeply.
2:3:13|2:3:21|Gu Manzhen stared blankly ahead after hearing these words, her thoughts seemingly drifting towards beautiful promises.
2:3:21|2:3:24|At this moment, [Shen Shijun] reached for her hand under the table.
2:3:37|2:3:52|[Gu Manzhen] took a deep breath and pulled her hand back from [Zhu Hongcai], as if this action had taken all her courage. She no longer had the strength to even turn her head to look at [Zhu Hongcai], only able to slowly calm herself by breathing slowly and steadily.
2:3:54|2:4:3|Watching the disappearing touch in her hand, [Shi Cuizhi] subconsciously rubbed it, then clasped her hands on the edge of the table and slowly lowered her head.
2:4:3|2:4:11|Thus, the two of them maintained their respective actions, unaware of how long they had been waiting, as the lively moments outside formed a stark contrast with them.
2:4:11|2:4:18|The reunion after many years should have been endless joy, but now there is an inexplicable heartache.
2:4:18|2:4:40|After a long silence, [Zhu Hongcai] suddenly remembered his past self. He recalled the first time he took a photo with [Gu Manzhen], at a place that left a deep impression on him after a brief encounter during the day. When he heard that [Gu Manzhen] had lost her glove, he braved the cold, holding a flashlight, searching all over the park.
2:4:40|2:4:48|Crossing the Yangcheng alley and passing through the bushes, [Shen Shijun] finally found the lonely glove in a corner of the pavilion.
