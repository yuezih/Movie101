0:2:2|0:2:10|[Liu Yue'e] suddenly placed the sign tube on the ground, and a wooden sign popped out, flying into the air.
0:2:10|0:2:14|She raised her head and grabbed a wooden stick, and the group walked out of the shop.
0:2:33|0:2:42|The title "My Family Has a River East Lion" appears on the screen.
0:3:52|0:4:5|Chen Jichang watched the five girls leave thoughtfully. The scene shifted to [Liu Yue'e] and her brother meeting a burly man with two twisted braids at a restaurant.
0:4:32|0:4:40|The two pushed the cup with force, spilling the wine.
0:5:1|0:5:7|[Liu Yue'e] also exerted force to spill the wine, and the two of them drank it all in one gulp. Yun Feiyang smiled and said,
0:6:29|0:6:40|[Liu Yue'e] turned around and glared at Yun Feiyang. The two locked eyes coldly, creating a tense atmosphere in the tavern. Suddenly, the eldest brother raised his glass in an attempt to ease the tension.
0:6:46|0:6:55|[Liu Yue'e] knocked Yun Feiyang down, left the restaurant, and then jumped on Yun Feiyang's back and beat him hard.
0:7:0|0:7:5|At the entrance of the tavern, chaos ensued as Liu Yue'e was lifted over the head by Yun Feiyang.
0:7:20|0:7:45|Yun Feiyang threw [Liu Yue'e] into the small river, but unexpectedly she landed on a small boat in the river. Yun Feiyang and his guards jumped into the river to continue the pursuit, while [Liu Yue'e] looked around. She picked up a washboard and threw it into the river, then leaped onto it, swiftly gliding forward by paddling with her right foot.
0:7:45|0:7:54|The spectators around the tavern applauded, [Liu Yue'e] waved to acknowledge them, while Yun Feiyang and other guards behind her were struggling to keep up.
0:7:54|0:8:3|But the two were moving at vastly different speeds. This water chase extended from the side of the restaurant all the way to the Three-Arch Bridge.
0:8:3|0:8:12|The surrounding audience cheered and clapped continuously. [Liu Yue'e] stepped on the washboard with her feet, about to glide out from the middle bridge tunnel.
0:8:14|0:8:23|Suddenly, a guard emerged from the river in front of her. [Liu Yue'e] swiftly flipped and jumped onto the stone bridge, using the washboard to strike sideways. The guard rushing towards her was hit and fell into the water.
0:8:24|0:8:31|[Liu Yue'e] chuckled lightly a few times, and the other guards continued to chase after her. She lifted the hem of her skirt and ran towards the bridge.
0:8:38|0:8:58|With a wicked smile, he lifted the lamp post and charged towards the guards. Swinging the lamp post horizontally, he knocked down many guards. [Liu Yue'e]'s elder brother and his servants arrived at the scene, drew their blades and swung them. Yun Feiyang came from behind and captured the elder brother.
0:9:12|0:9:19|After some consideration, Yun Feiyang took his big brother and headed towards [Liu Yue'e], holding him hostage.
0:9:27|0:9:35|He chopped at his older brother's arm, blood continuously spurting out. [Chen Jichang] walked over to watch the commotion.
0:9:45|0:9:50|[Liu Yue'e] picked up the lamp post and angrily rushed onto the stone bridge, causing everyone to dodge out of the way.
0:10:27|0:10:33|[Chen Jichang] opened the fan to fan himself, suddenly heard a creaking sound behind him, and quickly turned around to look.
0:10:44|0:10:53|Chen Jichang suddenly fell down, [Liu Yue'e] threw the lamp post aside, reached out with both hands to catch Chen Jichang steadily, while spinning and pulling him into her arms, the two looked into each other's eyes, full of tenderness.
0:10:55|0:11:3|Liu Yue'e looked Chen Jichang up and down with a pleased expression, and Chen Jichang fell into her arms accordingly.
0:11:3|0:11:13|At this moment, time seemed to stand still, like a dream. The two turned their heads and looked.
0:11:13|0:11:17|Yun Feiyang chopped towards his big brother's other arm, causing blood to flow out.
0:13:23|0:13:29|Chen Jichang bid farewell and left, while [Liu Yue'e] showed a joyful expression, gazing deeply at his departing figure.
0:13:29|0:13:35|The cool evening breeze brushed through the heat, and a recitation event by [Su Yongbang] is about to be held in the palace.
0:14:2|0:14:16|Amidst the crowd, [Liu Yue'e] entered the event venue carrying her nanny. As night fell and the lights came on, under the weeping willows, [Emperor] sat in the main seat, waiting for the event to begin.
0:14:35|0:14:47|The event begins, the host dances and runs, goes on stage, waves and gestures for the audience to keep quiet.
0:15:0|0:15:14|Accompanied by the bustling voices on the sidelines, numerous war drums resounded as they were pounded by strong men. On the wooden bridge, graceful and charming young girls, dressed in red with red drums around their waists, opened the scene stunningly.
0:15:14|0:15:26|Amid the cheers of the fans, [Su Yongbang] in a white robe quietly appeared on stage.
0:15:31|0:15:37|Making a grand entrance, [Chen Jichang] greeted in different directions, causing a stir.
0:18:31|0:18:45|The Emperor also threw a stone, hitting Chen Jichang on the forehead. Dongpo stopped Chen Jichang, turned and ran towards the backstage, while Chen Jichang awkwardly started to perform.
0:19:37|0:19:46|[Chen Jichang] focused his gaze on the only person interacting with him below the stage, [Liu Yue'e], ignoring the complaints of other audience members below. In his eyes, there was only [Liu Yue'e].
0:19:48|0:19:53|Chen Jichang was slightly moved, with tears shimmering in his eyes. He nodded slightly and began to sing slowly,
0:20:11|0:20:22|[Chen Jichang] also stood in the front, forgetting to sing.
0:20:34|0:20:52|The scene shifts to the victory banquet, where the [Emperor], Dongpo, and many officials are toasting and mingling. [Chen Jichang] sits slightly apart from the group, and [Liu Yue'e] walks over to him. They nod to each other and awkwardly find a topic to talk about.
0:21:17|0:21:23|Liu Yue'e seemed to sense his desolation, and after a moment of contemplation, sincerely said,
0:21:37|0:21:42|Chen Jichang looked at Liu Yue'e and smiled gratefully, casting a thankful glance.
0:22:15|0:22:20|Just as Chen Jichang embraced Liu Yue'e's neck and launched the final attack, a voice sounded,
0:22:45|0:23:3|[Liu Yue'e] thought for a moment, with a slight smile on her lips, she looked up and said, "I am Liu Yue'e." As the suona music started playing, the two of them changed into wedding attire that evening and held a wedding ceremony. Under the escort of the guards, they walked to the wedding venue and paid their respects to the [Emperor] and the dignitaries.
0:23:3|0:23:8|They sat in the main seats as if watching the excitement, receiving the bows one by one.
0:23:8|0:23:17|[Chen Jichang] had a pained expression on his face, tears streaming down, while [Liu Yue'e] had a radiant smile, looking very happy.
0:23:17|0:23:22|In the bridal chamber, one person is filled with joy, while the other sits dazedly at the edge of the bed.
0:23:22|0:23:23|The next day,
0:23:39|0:23:50|Elder brother, cousin, and others were all stunned, looking at each other, while [Liu Yue'e] blushed and ran away shyly.
0:25:12|0:25:20|Liu Yue'e fell down stiffly with bandages wrapped all over her body.
0:25:25|0:25:35|[Chen Jichang] returned home with a group of people, when suddenly three women ran up and dragged [Chen Jichang] away.
0:25:52|0:26:3|[Liu Yue'e] angrily grabbed a person's headpiece and threw them into the courtyard behind her, while the other two screamed and ran away. Glancing at the stunned [Chen Jichang], [Liu Yue'e] stormed into the courtyard.
0:27:20|0:27:25|Chen Jichang's mouth dropped open in astonishment,
0:28:8|0:28:15|In the market, [Chen Jichang] and his wife, Dongpo, along with a group of friends, sit together drinking and chatting.
0:28:23|0:28:28|[Liu Yue'e] looked at [Chen Jichang], and [Chen Jichang] immediately restrained his expression.
0:29:36|0:29:50|Dongpo handed the feather fan to [Chen Jichang], pushing him towards [Liu Yue'e]. [Chen Jichang] timidly approached her. He looked back at Dongpo, who gave him a nod to proceed.
0:29:51|0:29:56|[Chen Jichang] seemed to gather all his courage and gently tapped [Liu Yue'e] with a feather fan.
0:30:3|0:30:8|Dongpo dragged [Chen Jichang] away, then turned around and gave [Chen Jichang] a slap, saying,
0:31:5|0:31:10|[Liu Yue'e] walked through the market with a subtle expression, as if pondering something, while [Chen Jichang] and the others continued to enjoy themselves in the tavern, chatting and laughing.
0:31:10|0:31:31|The scene shifts to the Su residence, where [Liu Yue'e] kicks open the door. That evening, Su Dongpo arrives at the doorstep of [Chen Jichang]'s house.
0:31:44|0:31:51|The steward opened the door first and asked, [Chen Jichang] jumped out and said,
0:32:1|0:32:13|Dongpo stepped aside, with the Su family members behind him, all bound with bandages and bloodstains, standing unsteadily. [Chen Jichang] stood still, his brows slightly furrowed, scanning the people in front of him back and forth.
0:32:13|0:32:18|He took slightly heavy steps as he passed Dongpo and walked towards the crowd.
0:32:21|0:32:28|The Su family members were constantly moaning and crying in pain, and some fell to the ground due to exhaustion.
0:32:28|0:32:36|Chen Jichang walked over one by one, carefully examining their injuries, extending his hand with a touch of apology to gently caress the wounded areas.
0:32:36|0:32:45|With the young girl's broken arm cradled in his arms, [Chen Jichang] gently pats her back. Family members are either wrapped in bandages or carrying bamboo chairs on their heads.
0:32:45|0:32:53|But without exception, everyone had varying degrees of swelling and bruising on their bodies, with some even suffering from broken legs and being carried on stretchers.
0:32:53|0:33:2|He hurriedly took two steps forward, supported the person and placed him on the stretcher.
0:33:5|0:33:10|A chubby little boy with his head wrapped in bandages stood there looking aggrieved.
0:33:10|0:33:15|Jichang held him in his arms, feeling sorry and tender, gently comforting him.
0:33:15|0:33:22|Suddenly turning his head, he saw his childhood pet dog, Cuihua, also wrapped in bandages from being beaten.
0:33:24|0:33:30|He could no longer control his emotions, tears streaming down his face.
0:33:52|0:34:4|Su Dongpo handed a vine to Chen Jichang, who held it in his hand and walked into the room. Inside, Chen Jichang looked at Liu Yue'e with sorrow, waving the vine in his hand with force.
0:34:28|0:34:32|Accidentally hitting [Liu Yue'e], Chen Jichang was so scared that he kept backing away.
0:34:50|0:34:53|[Liu Yue'e] raised a cane and chased [Chen Jichang] out of the house.
0:36:28|0:36:36|Later, she began to recall the morning's experience, when in the chaos of the morning, [Liu Yue'e] overturned the dining table on the ground.
0:36:42|0:36:50|The crowd pointed fingers at the real culprit, while [Liu Yue'e] could only watch the chaos at the door helplessly and walked away.
0:37:20|0:37:40|[Chen Jichang] took the knife handed to him, his lips trembling, and said with a sorrowful expression. Then he picked up the knife, jumped to the side of the bamboo mat, and accidentally threw it in front of [Liu Yue'e]. [Liu Yue'e] picked up the knife, split the bamboo mat with one stroke, and also tore open Aunt Nine's clothes.
0:37:41|0:37:49|Liu Yue'e, with a clever look in her eyes, turned around and saw everyone picking up their belongings and fleeing.
0:38:4|0:38:11|Chen Jichang picked up the cane helplessly, raised it above his head, and Liu Yue'e took the cane and prepared to strike.
0:38:42|0:38:45|The steward closed the door, finally bringing the matter to a close.
0:38:46|0:38:52|In the bright daylight, [Chen Jichang], who was under house arrest, picked up his brush again to start creating.
0:38:52|0:38:58|Wearing a bandage with the words "inspiration" on his head, but still unable to come up with any inspiration to write.
0:38:59|0:39:6|Under the moonlight, [Chen Jichang] couldn't suppress the urge to go out, howling at the moon.
0:39:6|0:39:22|Liu Yue'e walked over with the dog after hearing it, Chen Jichang pretended to say,
0:39:28|0:39:32|Liu Yue'e joyfully spoke to the dog,
0:39:36|0:39:51|In the room, [Liu Yue'e] took the stack of books handed over by the servant, and in a blink of an eye, she fell asleep hugging the books. [Chen Jichang] came over and said to his wife,
0:39:56|0:40:2|[Chen Jichang] placed his wife on the bed, covered her with blankets, and laughed maniacally in a low voice.
0:40:2|0:40:8|He sneaked out of the room, closed the door quietly, and ran towards the outside of the house.
0:40:31|0:40:39|Chen Jichang embraces the steward,
0:41:7|0:41:28|[Chen Jichang] ran out of the mansion, while the steward went to the room to release the smoke. He aimed the blowpipe with his mouth to release the smoke, but ended up fainting himself on the ground. The Arabian Night was in full swing, with dazzling fireworks, women in Arabian attire coming and going, creating a lively scene.
0:41:28|0:41:36|[Chen Jichang] walked through the crowd with a smile on his face, greeting the passing ladies. Suddenly, someone tapped him on the shoulder from behind.
0:42:50|0:42:55|Among the wildflowers, [Liu Yue'e] wanders through, searching for [Chen Jichang].
0:42:55|0:43:0|At the table of wine and amidst the crowd, an Arabian girl dressed in exotic attire dances with her belly exposed.
0:43:0|0:43:6|[Liu Yue'e] looked at the Arabian girl among the crowd, with a puzzled and disdainful expression on her face.
0:43:6|0:43:11|Amidst the music and dance, the bustling noise and laughter, it was truly a lively scene.
0:43:11|0:43:19|Passing by the Arab girl dancing in the room, [Liu Yue'e] who couldn't find what she was looking for, turned back into the room with a slightly angry face, knocked the girl to the ground, and changed into exotic Arab clothing.
0:44:1|0:44:18|He happened to push [Liu Yue'e], who was wearing a veil, into [Chen Jichang], and [Liu Yue'e] pretended to be an Arabian girl, dancing in front of him.
0:44:38|0:44:55|The crowd scattered again, with [Chen Jichang] hiding under the table in fear. He cautiously peeked out and looked around before sitting back in his chair.
0:45:2|0:45:9|Chen Jichang drank up the wine in the bottle, suppressed his shock, while Liu Yue'e smiled with a displeased look.
0:45:9|0:45:16|Turning his head, [Chen Jichang], who was completely drunk and unconscious, was supported by two servants as he walked into the guest room of the tavern.
0:45:16|0:45:24|[Liu Yue'e] swayed her waist and followed into the room, [Chen Jichang] was helped onto the bed, muttering to himself,
0:45:43|0:45:51|Liu Yue'e stopped helplessly upon hearing this.
0:46:27|0:46:36|Liu Yue'e placed her leg on Chen Jichang's body, gently massaging his temples for him.
0:47:3|0:47:15|[Chen Jichang] frowned slightly, persistently speaking drunken words, while [Liu Yue'e] smiled at the corner of her eyes, gently stroking [Chen Jichang]'s head, then also leaned her head against [Chen Jichang]'s head, gently closing her eyes.
0:47:15|0:47:24|The next morning, the servants at home were cleaning the courtyard in an orderly manner. [Chen Jichang] rushed out of the house in a panic and ran towards the steward stumbling.
0:47:35|0:47:45|Liu Yue'e walked by, Chen Jichang quickly hid behind the steward, his eyes almost popping out in fear.
0:48:7|0:48:13|[Chen Jichang] hurriedly climbed the pillar and tried to escape outside the room. [Liu Yue'e] laughed at his silly appearance, and [Chen Jichang] quickly dodged away.
0:48:22|0:48:30|The steward handed over the cane.
0:49:22|0:49:29|In the palace, an [Imperial Physician] has selected soldiers to test the medicine. [Emperor], the experiment report has been completed.
0:49:53|0:49:56|Adi placed the tea eggs in front of Afu,
0:50:30|0:50:35|Su Yongbang, dressed in a purple robe, walked alongside the Emperor while fanning himself.
0:51:9|0:51:15|[Liu Yue'e] took the big knife and just set off, but with just one word from [Chen Jichang], [Liu Yue'e] was asked to abandon the knife and return.
0:51:22|0:51:28|[Liu Yue'e] turned around angrily, while her elder brother and his servants timidly turned back into the house.
0:51:57|0:52:10|[Liu Yue'e] placed her protective jade on the ground, lifted a brick, and smashed it down. The protective jade was directly crushed into powder, scattered by the wind, while the brick split in half and fell to the ground.
0:52:10|0:52:18|One person holding half, the other holding the other half of the brick, they laughed foolishly.
0:52:27|0:52:36|[Liu Yue'e] turned and ran towards the carriage, while [Chen Jichang] held the brick against his chest, watching her leave.
0:52:41|0:52:48|[Chen Jichang] sits in the study, penning the title of his novel. He strokes his chin, deep in thought.
0:52:49|0:52:55|At this moment, it was late at night, with no one outside, only the occasional chirping of cicadas. Inside the house,
0:52:55|0:53:0|[Chen Jichang] was immersed in his creation when suddenly a gust of demon wind blew in, causing the papers beside him to rustle loudly.
0:53:0|0:53:7|The window suddenly blew open, scattering the items on the table. [Chen Jichang] collected himself and neatly rearranged the objects.
0:53:7|0:53:16|He bent down to pick up the scattered manuscript on the ground, only to be surprised by a rabbit with its right foot injured and stained with blood in front of him.
0:53:16|0:53:24|He gently picked up the rabbit, carefully examining its injured foot, then slowly looked up. After a moment of contemplation, he suddenly looked around.
0:53:24|0:53:54|As if suddenly remembering something, he suddenly shouted loudly, Chen Jichang called Dongpo over, Su Yongbang walked in, picked up the rabbit, set up the tableware on the dining table, and a Taoist priest lit straw with yellow talisman paper.
0:54:7|0:54:19|[Chen Jichang] went out to catch a rabbit, only to find the hemp rope on the ground had been broken free. He was very surprised, when suddenly a figure in white appeared behind him.
0:54:20|0:54:29|[Chen Jichang] turned back nervously and saw a woman with long hair covering her face, with both ears, and a injured right foot appearing behind him.
0:54:29|0:54:35|He suddenly thought of the injured rabbit's foot, quickly looked up and down, and stared carefully.
0:54:35|0:54:39|Suddenly, his brows furrowed and a look of distress appeared on his face.
0:54:53|0:54:57|Several people were about to go out to search, but they collided with the rabbit demon at the door and hurried back into the house.
0:54:57|0:55:2|The rabbit demon appeared again in front of them, and the group panicked and fled into a corner.
0:55:12|0:55:18|The Taoist priest entered the room alone through the window, while the others stood at the door looking into the room.
0:55:18|0:55:26|The rabbit demon appeared behind the group again, but they were completely unaware. The Taoist inside the house saw it and quickly turned and ran away.
0:55:26|0:55:33|The rest of them, seeing the Taoist's reaction, nervously turned their heads to look behind them.
0:55:42|0:55:46|[Chen Jichang] shivered and huddled in the corner of the bed, as the rabbit demon approached the bedside.
0:56:21|0:56:29|Chen Jichang looked somewhat reluctantly at the crying rabbit demon with tearful eyes.
0:57:5|0:57:11|[Chen Jichang] stared blankly at the rabbit demon approaching closer and closer, until she pressed against his chest and lay down on the bed.
0:57:18|0:57:26|The next morning, the sky was bright, birds were chirping. Light gauze and shoes and socks were scattered on the floor of the study, and two figures were lying flat on the bed.
0:57:26|0:57:30|[Chen Jichang] suddenly woke up.
0:58:5|0:58:15|Princess Ping'an, dressed in exquisite attire after changing clothes, walked slowly out of the house. Chen Jichang was stunned to see the courtyard full of guards, his jaw dropping in surprise.
0:58:42|0:58:53|During the break, the four guards kept watch outside the house. The princess bent down, picked up a basin of wild flowers, and walked over to [Chen Jichang], handing it to him, saying,
0:59:6|0:59:9|Princess Ping'an turned away with a sorrowful expression.
0:59:9|0:59:17|[Chen Jichang] puts on his clothes in the room, picks up the half piece of stone, and heads back home, leaving a pot of wildflowers on the desk.
0:59:22|0:59:33|[Chen Jichang] walked to the doorstep with a backpack on his back, tidying his clothes as he walked, sniffing to see if there was anyone else's scent on him.
0:59:41|0:59:49|[Liu Yue'e] took off her bamboo hat, her face full of smiles, [Chen Jichang] looked at her affectionately and couldn't help but take two steps forward.
1:0:31|1:0:35|As they walked towards the house, they were stopped by the steward holding wildflowers.
1:0:35|1:0:41|Outside the house, [Princess Ping'an] and her servant stood waiting. [Liu Yue'e] was full of doubt.
1:1:12|1:1:17|Chen Jichang calmly replied,
1:1:49|1:1:54|Chen Jichang remained silent, bowing his head as the answer was about to be revealed.
1:1:56|1:2:8|Suddenly, the gate of the Chen family was kicked open by the guards of [Princess Ping'an]. [Princess Ping'an] walked in, but [Liu Yue'e] seemed to have not heard anything, with only red eyes, looking at the man she deeply loved in front of her.
1:2:15|1:2:24|It seemed unbelievable, as if unwilling to accept, and deeply disappointing. [Liu Yue'e] gave [Chen Jichang] a deep look, then turned around and struck towards [Princess Ping'an].
1:2:24|1:2:32|The guard grabbed [Liu Yue'e]'s arm, and [Princess Ping'an] took the opportunity to retreat back into the courtyard. However, due to the difference in strength, [Liu Yue'e] used a few moves to retreat back into the courtyard.
1:2:32|1:2:40|She steadied herself and looked at her husband, but [Chen Jichang] did not speak up for his wife, just holding his head with both hands, motionless.
1:2:40|1:2:52|Disappointed [Liu Yue'e] turned around and glared at [Princess Ping'an] in the distance. [Princess Ping'an] seemed a bit aggrieved, standing among the guards. The two of them stared at each other from a distance, creating a tense atmosphere.
1:2:53|1:3:7|The elder brother saw his sister being bullied, picked up the broom nearby, and flew towards [Princess Ping'an] to strike, but was kicked aside by a guard and hit his head on the stone steps, passing out.
1:3:9|1:3:16|Upon seeing her elder brother injured, [Liu Yue'e] was immediately grabbed by the guard by the collar and thrown backwards out of the courtyard, kicking up a cloud of dust.
1:3:18|1:3:23|Outside the courtyard, [Liu Yue'e] stood up shakily, looking disheveled.
1:3:23|1:3:30|She walked heavily, step by step, looking at [Chen Jichang]. Anger, unwillingness, disappointment.
1:3:30|1:3:36|Tears welled up in his eyes. Just as he was about to enter, he was stopped by the guards at the door.
1:3:36|1:3:43|Chen Jichang seemed to want to escape from everything, just whimpering, squatting down, covering his ears, and staying out of it.
1:3:43|1:3:52|Furious [Liu Yue'e] clenched her hands tightly in front of the wall-like guards, veins bulging, sighed deeply, and suddenly threw a punch.
1:3:52|1:3:58|Four guards made their move at the same time, leaving [Liu Yue'e] outnumbered and forced onto the street.
1:3:58|1:4:11|Looking at the wall of people in front of her, she steadied herself, took a few steps forward, approached the guards, suddenly moved her feet quickly, stared straight at the courtyard, hoping to find a breakthrough and return to her own home.
1:4:11|1:4:18|She suddenly made a move, exchanging blows with four guards. Just as she managed to break through, she was stopped by the guards.
1:4:18|1:4:22|The two fists were no match for the eight hands, and [Liu Yue'e] was narrowly defeated.
1:4:22|1:4:30|In a series of fights, [Liu Yue'e] is feeling a bit exhausted, leaning against a lamp post and panting heavily, while the street is crowded with onlookers.
1:4:30|1:4:38|[Liu Yue'e] looked at the guards in the distance, then glanced at the lamp post beside her. That confident [Liu Yue'e] seemed to have returned.
1:4:38|1:4:44|She raised her eyebrows lightly, bent down to embrace the lamp post, and exerted force to pull it out, holding it in front of her as she rushed forward.
1:4:47|1:5:1|Two guards flew onto the lamp post and kept spinning. [Liu Yue'e], being a woman, gradually lost control of the lamp post and was thrown out herself. The guards then put the lamp post back in its original position.
1:5:1|1:5:9|The other two guards acted together to capture [Liu Yue'e], rendering her unable to move, with a loss of spirit in her eyes.
1:5:12|1:5:19|In the prison cell, the disheveled [Liu Yue'e] sat on the ground, with sunken eye sockets, looking extremely miserable.
1:5:19|1:5:26|Next to him, a fellow inmate asked,
1:5:56|1:6:3|Liu Yue'e turned around and asked softly,
1:6:16|1:6:27|Deep in the palace, heavily guarded, a eunuch hurried over in the imperial garden and whispered something in the ear of the [Emperor]. After hearing it, the [Emperor] slowly stood up, looking slightly surprised.
1:6:27|1:6:44|The scene shifts to the entrance of the Golden Luang Palace of the [Emperor], with imperial guards in armor and carrying precious swords visible everywhere from the palace passageway to the outer square. They stand on both sides, all the way to the side of the [Emperor], exuding an imposing aura.
1:6:45|1:6:52|Walking through the gate and arriving at the square in front of the palace, the weary [Liu Yue'e] stood in the center, looking around with a tired expression on her face.
1:6:52|1:7:1|The Emperor and Empress sat on the main seats, with maids and eunuchs standing by their sides. On both sides of the square, the Imperial Physician's cousin anxiously looked towards Liu Yue'e.
1:7:1|1:7:8|[Chen Jichang], the eldest brother, stood slightly calm on the side. [Princess Ping'an] took the teacup and stood by the square, looking towards [Liu Yue'e].
1:7:8|1:7:16|Dongpo stepped forward and said,
1:7:34|1:7:43|Princess Ping'an came to offer tea, and Dongpo quietly instructed,
1:7:45|1:7:53|Princess Ping'an looked at Liu Yue'e with a smug smile. Under everyone's gaze, Liu Yue'e knocked over the teacup with a backhand.
1:7:53|1:8:2|Princess Ping'an looked disdainfully at the broken teacup on the ground, then angrily walked back to the Emperor's side.
1:8:2|1:8:10|The Emperor looked on coldly at everything happening, then gestured for the Empress to speak.
1:8:37|1:8:43|Dongpo turned to look at [Chen Jichang], and the [Emperor] replied,
1:9:8|1:9:17|[Liu Yue'e] was on the verge of tears, sniffing slightly.
1:10:6|1:10:14|Suddenly, with yellow sand filling the sky, all the officials bowed down, and [Chen Jichang] was pulled down to the ground by Dongpo.
1:10:17|1:10:38|[Liu Yue'e] stared defiantly at the [Emperor], only calming down after being comforted by the Empress. [Princess Ping'an] also offered consolation on the side, while the officials cautiously observed and waited for the storm to pass.
1:10:40|1:10:47|Everyone stood up, only [Chen Jichang] remained kneeling on the ground.
1:10:47|1:10:53|Liu Yue'e continued to stare straight at the Emperor, who was taken aback, and the atmosphere became tense again.
1:10:53|1:11:7|Dongpo saw [Liu Yue'e] in the square and exclaimed. Suddenly, a strong wind rose, sand and stones flew, and the entire hall was filled with sand and dust.
1:11:7|1:11:16|Surrounded by all the Imperial Guards holding weapons, [Liu Yue'e] stood in the middle with clenched fists, looking up to the sky and letting out a long roar.
1:11:18|1:11:24|Chen Jichang just buried his head in the ground. In the raging wind, Liu Yue'e looked as if she were going mad.
1:11:24|1:11:29|Her hair danced in the wind, and none of the imperial guards dared to approach and capture her.
1:11:30|1:11:45|The howling wind swept up dry branches, and fallen leaves danced in the air. [Emperor] had to squint his eyes, while the royal umbrella beside him was blown down to the ground. [Liu Yue'e] became even more frantic, tearing at her hair with both hands, as if trying to release all her grievances, tears streaming down her face.
1:11:45|1:11:53|Slowly he stayed behind. The roar drifted in the wind, gradually fading away.
1:11:54|1:12:3|[Chen Jichang] buried his head even lower, as if he could no longer face [Liu Yue'e]. The square gradually returned to calm.
1:12:3|1:12:13|[Liu Yue'e] sobbed and curled up, looking even more fragile. Her eyes were filled with tears.
1:12:13|1:12:21|Full of desolation, she no longer holds any hope for Chen Jichang.
1:12:52|1:13:11|[Chen Jichang] blended a thousand regrets into this sentence, leaving [Liu Yue'e] speechless and choked with tears streaming down her face.
1:13:27|1:13:35|Cousin [Imperial Physician] couldn't bear it in his heart, so he spoke up,
1:13:42|1:13:55|[Liu Yue'e] stood still, with a look of sorrow and indignation. A maid held a tray and brought the Forgetfulness Water, pouring it into a cup. From afar, her elder brother shouted to her,
1:14:7|1:14:13|Liu Yue'e slowly closed her eyes, as if she had made a firm decision.
1:14:13|1:14:21|Glancing at the Forgetfulness Water, she held it in her hand. Like a final farewell, she looked towards [Chen Jichang].
1:15:43|1:15:50|[Chen Jichang] had a complex expression on his face, with a furrowed brow, but he raised his head firmly and said,
1:16:55|1:17:0|The eldest brother sat on the steps holding the dog, while the nanny leaned against the pillar, wiping away tears with a handkerchief.
1:17:1|1:17:10|Outside the courtyard, flowers are blooming in competition. The scene shifts to the room of [Liu Yue'e], who slowly wakes up and sits up from under the covers.
1:17:10|1:17:17|Probably not fully awake yet, he sat on the edge of the bed. A gentle breeze blew outside the window.
1:17:19|1:17:27|She stretched comfortably with her hands behind her back. Perhaps the Forgetfulness Potion had taken effect, as she looked around with a hint of confusion.
1:17:27|1:17:36|After getting dressed, [Chen Jichang] walked out of the room and saw his elder brother sitting dejectedly in a chair, lost in thought. His elder brother was surprised and snapped out of it.
1:17:37|1:17:50|Everyone looked at her in surprise, and a crowd quickly gathered around her. She asked in confusion,
1:18:2|1:18:9|Upon opening the door, everyone's faces were filled with anger, except for [Liu Yue'e] who remained calm. [Chen Jichang] was seen standing at the doorway.
1:18:10|1:18:21|Liu Yue'e awkwardly patted the wet nurse, and a look of reminiscence appeared in her eyes when she heard the call.
1:18:21|1:18:31|[Chen Jichang] anxiously looked at Liu Yue'e, then took out the half brick from behind and handed it over, eyes full of anticipation, a smile on his lips, hoping to awaken her.
1:18:31|1:18:38|Yue'e. Liu Yue'e seemed to remember something, she lightly stepped forward towards Chen Jichang.
1:18:38|1:18:44|Taking the half brick, [Liu Yue'e] carefully examined it. However, she suddenly smashed it towards [Chen Jichang].
1:18:47|1:18:54|Mr. Dongpo hurried over to support him.
1:19:14|1:19:20|Liu Yue'e seemed to have truly forgotten, casually throwing the brick on the ground, splitting it in half.
1:19:20|1:19:28|[Chen Jichang] rubbed his forehead, picked up the broken brick, walked towards the tightly closed gate, and then helplessly turned back.
1:19:28|1:19:35|The crowd looked anxiously at the rejected Chen Jichang, but he suddenly had a bright idea and turned to place the ladder against the courtyard wall.
1:19:40|1:19:50|He hurried in with quick steps, climbing in through the ladder in just a few steps. As soon as he entered the courtyard, his elder brother led the family guards, brandishing weapons and surrounding him in the middle.
1:19:55|1:19:59|The courtyard door slowly opened, and [Chen Jichang] walked out with a dejected look.
1:19:59|1:20:7|Dongpo and his friends watched as [Chen Jichang] turned and ran away. Soon after, [Chen Jichang] joyfully swung his flying claws.
1:20:7|1:20:10|Then he threw it into the courtyard, trying to climb into the yard.
1:20:11|1:20:18|He tugged on the rope to make sure it was secure, but to his surprise, the flying claw fell off, with his big brother's wig still attached to it.
1:20:18|1:20:25|Big Brother came out of the main gate, blushing and angry, and walked towards [Chen Jichang], snatching the wig from his hand.
1:20:26|1:20:31|Big Brother Mang hurried back to the courtyard, and a group of people including Dongpo gathered around.
1:20:55|1:21:11|The crowd spread out mats at the entrance of the escort agency, sitting on the ground and taking out roast duck and wine they brought, chatting and laughing. [Chen Jichang] looked at the tightly closed gate of the escort agency, sat down slowly, looking very aloof among the crowd.
1:21:11|1:21:15|He was determined to wait here no matter what.
1:21:16|1:21:22|After an unknown amount of time, the gate of the escort agency slowly opened, and a maid walked out and said,
1:21:26|1:21:39|[Chen Jichang] stood up in surprise among the crowd of people, while servants stood around in the living room. [Chen Jichang] and [Liu Yue'e] sat facing each other.
1:22:13|1:22:18|Elder Brother greeted them with a smile as they walked out the door.
1:22:32|1:23:7|[Liu Yue'e] walked away disdainfully, [Chen Jichang] rushed towards Master Tian, but fell down when stepping off the stairs. Even his maid Xiaohu and the dog Beibei turned to the elder brother. [Chen Jichang] stood up abruptly, [Liu Yue'e] smiled politely, the elder brother grabbed Master Tian and walked inside.
1:23:16|1:23:25|The group awkwardly left the escort agency. In the evening, accompanied by the distant chirping of cicadas, all the troubles seemed to have passed.
1:23:25|1:23:31|Only the cane on [Liu Yue'e]'s bed remembers the story that once happened.
1:23:31|1:23:48|Wearing a red wedding dress, [Liu Yue'e] leaned against the window, looking outside, then turned back into the room, facing her reflection in the water basin, gently touching her cheek, carefully examining herself. The next day, the sun was shining brightly, and a gentle breeze was blowing.
1:23:48|1:23:56|On the street, a group of people in red wedding attire, holding red silk, attracting a crowd of onlookers who eagerly join in the festive atmosphere.
1:23:57|1:24:4|The bridal sedan chair is being carried, positioned in the center of the procession, and moving towards the destination with drums and gongs.
1:24:4|1:24:14|In a room, the [Imperial Physician] is sitting in a wooden tub being bathed. [Chen Jichang] and his group, with their faces covered, arrive behind him.
1:24:16|1:24:21|The maid on the side was also scared and ran away.
1:24:23|1:24:32|Amidst the sound of firecrackers, the wedding procession arrived at its destination, with [Su Yongbang] and his family standing outside the courtyard, beaming with joy.
1:24:32|1:24:42|As the curtains of the bridal sedan chair were lifted, the bride stepped out, with [Liu Yue'e], [Chen Jichang], and others hiding in the distance, stealing glances.
1:24:42|1:24:56|[Chen Jichang] and the bailiffs in official uniforms arrived at the sedan chair. The crowd hurriedly knelt down to receive the decree. On the side, [Liu Yue'e] pushed her friend, who was disguised as a matchmaker, forward.
1:24:56|1:24:59|He came to the bride, holding his throat,
1:25:1|1:25:10|Turning around and carrying the bride on his back, avoiding the gaze of the crowd, [Chen Jichang] walked unsteadily into the courtyard. Seeing the plan proceeding smoothly, he breathed a sigh of relief.
1:25:10|1:25:19|In the courtyard, after someone set down the bride, they immediately released smoke to make her faint. Outside the courtyard, Su Yongbang asked,
1:25:26|1:25:32|Young Master Tian nodded helplessly and continued to bow his head, only to see [Chen Jichang] running over with a plate of razor clams.
1:26:15|1:26:32|Chen Jichang hurriedly ran to the Grand National Temple, trying to make Liu Yue'e drink the antidote. However, he tripped on the way, causing the antidote to slip out of his hand. Chen Jichang looked on in despair as the medicine spilled on the ground.
1:26:38|1:26:46|[Chen Jichang] hurriedly got up and ran towards the Grand Xiangguo Temple, clinging to the last glimmer of hope. The others followed, leaving [Imperial Physician] alone on the bridge.
1:26:46|1:27:1|They had just arrived at the Daxiangguo Temple, but were stopped outside by the guards. [Liu Yue'e] carefully identified them through the gauze window, and then recognized them.
1:27:48|1:27:55|The crowd started to fight, almost overturning the registration desk. [Chen Jichang] took advantage of the chaos to grab a registration sign and ran towards the preparation area.
1:27:55|1:27:58|But this scene of powerful martial arts and numerous people shocked them.
1:28:3|1:28:9|Participants entered one after another, with only Chen Jichang climbing using both hands and feet.
1:28:20|1:28:27|Watching the figures in the field with their tiger-like backs and bear-like waists, wielding various weapons such as knives, spears, sticks, axes, and hooks, [Chen Jichang] clearly felt uncomfortable and fearful.
1:28:27|1:28:35|He clumsily waved a short wooden stick, but dropped it several times. As the bell rang, the elder brother announced the rules of the competition.
1:28:54|1:29:2|The rules of the competition have been changed at the last minute, clearly targeting [Chen Jichang].
1:29:2|1:29:10|The group fight for marriage proposal has officially begun, with everyone on the field fighting together.
1:29:11|1:29:19|[Chen Jichang] shouted and rushed towards a muscular man, but accidentally dropped his short stick, and could only wave his hands around in a panic.
1:29:19|1:29:25|The man rubbed his wrist, knocked down [Chen Jichang] to the ground, and punched him unconscious.
1:29:28|1:29:35|[Chen Jichang] staggered to his feet, his head feeling heavy and dizzy from the heavy blow.
1:29:35|1:29:45|He looked around at the chaotic scene, weapons showing no mercy, one after another falling down. He picked up the fallen circular double-edged blade in front of him and attacked like a madman.
1:29:45|1:29:56|The saying goes, "brave wins when meeting on a narrow road." At this moment, [Chen Jichang] seems to have no fear, charging and knocking down one after another on the stage.
1:29:59|1:30:7|Suddenly stopping, he looked back at everyone. The scene was very quiet, and the others slowly stood up, glaring angrily at Chen Jichang.
1:30:7|1:30:12|They suddenly realized that there were scars all over their bodies, faces, and even on their buttocks.
1:30:12|1:30:28|Calm down, [Chen Jichang] once again felt fear, [Chen Jichang] turned to look at [Liu Yue'e], and sang,
1:30:36|1:30:50|In the arena, someone gave a punch to [Chen Jichang], followed by a double team attack that knocked him down. Surrounded by the crowd, [Chen Jichang] completely lost the ability to fight back, his eyes wide open, seeming somewhat unwilling.
1:30:50|1:30:55|He was unwilling to stop at the last moment, and even more unwilling to give up on [Liu Yue'e].
1:31:4|1:31:16|Dongpo and the steward saw the beaten [Chen Jichang], calling out to him, but [Chen Jichang] seemed to not hear, slowly bowing his body and tremblingly standing up again.
1:31:16|1:31:25|The surrounding crowd saw it, but then a few hooks knocked him down to the ground.
1:31:25|1:31:39|This time, even his willpower couldn't support him to stand up again. A chubby man in white was applying makeup while speaking, and then the chaos in the scene erupted again.
1:31:39|1:31:50|Liu Yue'e suddenly stood up and walked towards the side of the arena, looking at Chen Jichang on the stage. In the distance, the Imperial Physician and the general rode to the scene, and Princess Ping'an spoke up.
1:32:3|1:32:9|After hearing this, everyone quickly jumped off the stage, and Dongpo walked over to [Imperial Physician].
1:32:26|1:32:35|Perhaps it was Chen Jichang who touched his elder brother, and at this moment, his elder brother also helped him. Liu Yue'e and the crowd below the stage looked at Chen Jichang in the arena.
1:32:36|1:32:44|He slowly got up, still looking like a weak scholar, but his clothes were disheveled, with blood on his face, as his elder brother began the countdown.
1:32:44|1:32:59|He recalled the day when [Liu Yue'e] picked up the cane, and it seemed like [Liu Yue'e] also remembered that night, turning her head to reminisce.
1:32:59|1:33:2|Chen Jichang walks on the stage listlessly.
1:33:2|1:33:12|Memories of the past come flooding back. Even back at the storytelling event, the two of them were already enjoying each other's company.
1:33:17|1:33:22|From that day on, the two seemed to have found the most compatible souls.
1:33:22|1:33:29|Despite the unexpected events in life and the stark differences in personalities, there is no doubt about the future of the two.
1:33:29|1:33:37|Intertwined deeply for a long time, they are hard to separate. With a weak constitution and intense physical activity, injuries have taken a toll on them.
1:33:37|1:33:46|Chen Jichang took a step towards Liu Yue'e, his eyes almost unable to stay open, relying solely on his determination to keep going.
1:33:46|1:33:53|The elder brother, the nanny, and the maid all shed tears, hoping that [Liu Yue'e] can return to her original appearance.
1:33:53|1:33:59|Yue'e gazed at [Chen Jichang] with a longing look, as if the frozen memories were gradually unfolding.
1:33:59|1:34:10|Suddenly, exhausted [Chen Jichang] knelt down on the ground, using the last of his strength to speak the words deep in his heart to Yue'e.
1:35:10|1:35:26|The memories of the past came to mind, and he chuckled at the silly look of [Chen Jichang].
1:35:37|1:35:56|[Chen Jichang] had red eyes, tears welling up as he looked at Liu Yue'e. Hearing those words, tears streamed down Liu Yue'e's face.
1:36:3|1:36:10|With these words, [Liu Yue'e] cried uncontrollably, and the resentment in her heart slowly dissipated.
1:36:29|1:36:36|Liu Yue'e rushed to the stage eagerly and embraced the fainted Chen Jichang in her arms.
1:37:10|1:37:16|Dongpo turned his head and asked the [Imperial Physician].
