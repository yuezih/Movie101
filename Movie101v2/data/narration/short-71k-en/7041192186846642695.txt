0:3:28|0:3:37|[Chen Xiang] came to the front of the case to register her name, and the chief eunuch standing behind her flicked her ear.
0:3:39|0:3:48|[Chen Xiang] trembled as he turned around, looking up. [Chen Xiang] dared not meet his eyes directly, lowering her head.
0:3:59|0:4:9|Chen Xiang's voice had just fallen, and the palace gate slowly opened. The selected young palace maids stood at the door, curiously peering inside.
0:4:34|0:4:46|Accompanied by the chief eunuch, Chen Xiang followed the team all the way to the depths of the palace. As the team climbed the steps, Chen Xiang touched his ear and shouted loudly.
0:4:47|0:4:55|[Chen Xiang] chased after the steadily falling beads, running further and further away.
0:4:57|0:5:10|[Chen Xiang] picked up the beads and looked up, in front of her was a desolate palace. She had no idea where she was, but curiosity drove her to step into the courtyard.
0:5:10|0:5:23|The palace was in ruins, with weeds growing in the courtyard. [Chen Xiang] cautiously walked inside, feeling a sudden chill in the air. As she continued, the feeling of unease grew, causing her to slow down and stop.
0:5:23|0:5:32|She turned and ran towards the door, but suddenly heard a strange sound behind her. [Chen Xiang] turned around and met the gaze of an eye peeking through the crack in the door.
0:5:32|0:5:49|At this moment, the chief eunuch approached and slapped [Chen Xiang] across the face, causing her earring to fly out.
0:5:53|0:5:59|A group of eunuchs suddenly burst in from outside the door, shouting "Thirteenth Prince".
0:5:59|0:6:5|The chief eunuch carried [Chen Xiang] on his shoulders and walked out, [Chen Xiang] couldn't help but look back.
0:6:6|0:6:13|The closed shop door was opened, and a noble-looking young man walked out, who was the thirteenth prince [Yin Xiang].
0:6:13|0:6:28|A large group of crows flew out of the palace, frightening the eunuchs into chaos. [Yin Xiang] stood at the door, with a cold and indifferent look hiding a hint of sadness. An old eunuch rushed forward to throw himself at [Yin Xiang], only to be pushed away by him.
0:6:28|0:6:40|A large group of eunuchs rushed forward from behind, with [Yin Xiang] roaring and struggling against them, but he was firmly pressed to the ground by them, with his hands and feet bound, unable to move.
0:6:40|0:6:51|And behind them in the shop hung a huge golden cage, [Chen Xiang] widened his eyes, looking at everything happening in front of him with a pensive expression.
0:6:54|0:6:58|The cold cage emits light, slowly transforming into a young master, followed by the appearance of the film title.
0:6:58|0:7:1|The following is the main part of the movie.
0:7:13|0:7:27|After finishing her scolding, [Chen Xiang] looked around and slowly turned to leave. The young palace maids stood in two rows, all bowing their heads and not daring to look at her. After [Chen Xiang] left, everyone breathed a sigh of relief and started laughing and joking.
0:7:27|0:7:36|An older palace maid, [Chen Xiang], bullies her way into the young maids' dormitory.
0:7:36|0:7:45|[Chen Xiang] stood by the bed and took out a bag of snacks, attracting the attention of the old palace maids. They approached and surrounded [Chen Xiang], who was still smiling foolishly.
0:7:59|0:8:6|Tearing apart, the snack fell on the ground, and [Chen Xiang] with red eyes was slapped by the old palace maid.
0:8:10|0:8:16|[Chen Xiang] shrank into a ball, surrounded by eerie laughter.
0:8:24|0:8:37|Outside the window stood a long-haired female ghost. The palace maids screamed in fear, leaving only [Chen Xiang] in the room, who had to curl up in the corner.
0:8:38|0:8:48|The female ghost floated in from the doorway and headed straight for [Chen Xiang]. [Chen Xiang] was so scared that she covered her eyes. Through the gaps between her fingers, she saw the ghost's hand, which appeared no different from a human's, so she slowly lowered her hand.
0:8:48|0:8:58|The female ghost pushed aside her hair, revealing a young palace maid about the same age as [Chen Xiang]. The maid sat on the bed and started eating [Chen Xiang]'s pastries.
0:9:18|0:9:26|The two were attracted by a song and sneaked out.
0:9:29|0:9:44|The two held hands and walked through a long corridor following the sound of music, where a beautiful woman was dancing.
0:10:39|0:10:48|In the icy and snowy landscape, the woman jumps with great effort, like a celestial being in the sky, as beautiful as a painting.
0:11:11|0:11:16|Next to the aunt is the dancing woman, who is now frozen into a snowman.
0:11:16|0:11:27|[Chen Xiang] couldn't help but look back at the team. Several eunuchs lifted the dancer's body, but one of them slipped and fell from the bridge, landing heavily on the ground.
0:11:36|0:11:44|[Liu Li] picked up his bowl and exchanged a smile with [Chen Xiang] across the table.
0:11:46|0:11:57|At night, [Liu Li] mysteriously took out an egg and handed it to [Chen Xiang]. The two of them lay together, playing around as if no one else was around, bringing a touch of warmth to the cold palace.
0:11:57|0:12:5|Things slowly fell into place, with [Liu Li] and [Chen Xiang] both adapting well to palace life, their hairstyles neat and tidy.
0:12:14|0:12:20|The maids each held a round watermelon and angrily threw them to the ground, shattering them into pieces.
0:12:21|0:12:37|The days passed by, repeating themselves, and the young palace maids who entered the palace years ago gradually lost their youthful innocence to the passage of time. The once naive girls have grown into graceful young ladies, with [Liu Li] and [Chen Xiang] relying on each other in the palace, spending a long 7 years together.
0:13:40|0:13:46|[Liu Li] is eager to track down the whereabouts of the princes in [Chun Shou]'s hands, but [Chen Xiang] on the side remains indifferent.
0:14:6|0:14:13|[Liu Li] held the sachet containing the whereabouts of the Ninth Prince tightly in her hand, approaching [Chen Xiang].
0:14:51|0:15:1|The aunt shouted outside the door, and the two finally stopped. The next day, the Ruyi Pavilion was in chaos.
0:15:18|0:15:39|[Chen Xiang] sat in front of a table staring at a painting, [Liu Li] waved at her from the second floor, and she reluctantly put down the painting. Looking at the center of the hall, there hung a portrait, exactly the same as the one [Chen Xiang] had just seen, depicting a man in armor riding a war horse, with a handsome face and captivating eyes.
0:16:0|0:16:27|[Chun Shou]'s vivid description made [Chen Xiang] feel as if she were there. She saw the Thirteenth Prince galloping on a horse from a distance, followed by a group of black panthers. One of the black panthers seized [Yin Xiang] and knocked him to the ground, while the others pounced on him one after another. In a blink of an eye, [Yin Xiang]'s armor was torn to pieces, covered with numerous horrifying claw marks.
0:16:28|0:16:45|He roared and stood up to send several black panthers flying. For a moment, the panthers dared not approach. [Yin Xiang] took the advantage, striking from left and right, kicking away two panthers. Then he jumped up in place and swiftly dealt with one in front of him with a slash, before turning around to chop down another one attempting to sneak up from behind.
0:16:45|0:16:51|He agilely dodges the attacks of the black panther, wielding only a small dagger in his hand.
0:16:52|0:17:0|Before long, the ground beside them was covered with the bodies of black panthers. [Chen Xiang] was so engrossed in the story that she was startled into a scream.
0:17:6|0:17:11|[Chen Xiang] shyly covers her blushing face and runs to the side.
0:17:11|0:17:25|The portrait of the Thirteenth Prince on the table was blown out of the window by a gust of wind. [Chen Xiang] hurriedly chased after it, walking down the steps further and further away.
0:17:36|0:17:50|[Chen Xiang] chased the portrait all the way into the corridor. She stared at the portrait and jumped in place, finally firmly grasping the portrait in her hand. Before she could even feel happy, her gaze was attracted by the man in luxurious clothes in the archway.
0:17:50|0:18:1|Thirteenth Prince [Yin Xiang] and Fourth Prince [Yin Xi] walked through the corridor from the archway. [Yin Xiang] turned his head with a smile, and his gaze met the absent-minded [Chen Xiang] who was looking at him.
0:18:1|0:18:8|[Chen Xiang] came to his senses, turned around in a panic trying to escape, but accidentally fell down.
0:18:8|0:18:14|[Yin Xiang] reached out his hand to help her, but [Chen Xiang] looked up and knew he couldn't overstep, so she quickly got up.
0:18:20|0:18:30|Fourth Prince [Yin Xi] spoke coldly, [Chen Xiang] turned pale with fright, lowering her head even further in extreme fear, [Yin Xiang] couldn't bear it in his heart and helped her out.
0:18:35|0:18:40|The two princes turned and left, leaving [Chen Xiang] standing alone in place. She watched them go with the corner of her eye.
0:18:41|0:18:48|After the two of them walked away, she finally breathed a sigh of relief and couldn't help but laugh at the thought of Thirteenth Prince.
0:18:48|0:18:57|She hurriedly took out the painting in her hand, only to find that the paper had been crumpled into a ball by herself. She returned to the previous hall.
0:19:59|0:20:13|[Liu Li] stuffed a handkerchief into [Chen Xiang]'s hand and ran away. At night, darkness spread and enveloped the entire imperial garden. Ninth Prince [Yin Xi] hurriedly passed by a rockery.
0:20:15|0:20:21|Suddenly a bucket of water was poured over him evenly, he turned his head with a cold face to look.
0:20:36|0:20:44|[Yin Xi] remained silent, and [Liu Li] got up on her own, tentatively walked towards him, reaching out to help him with the laundry.
0:20:44|0:20:51|[Yin Xi] looked down at [Liu Li] and smiled with satisfaction, while [Liu Li] hurriedly explained.
0:20:55|0:21:8|[Yin Xi] said nothing, just smiled at her. Seeing Ninth Prince remain silent, [Liu Li] had to give up.
0:21:9|0:21:17|[Liu Li] stopped in his tracks, his eyes red with nervousness. On the other side, [Chen Xiang] sat at the entrance of the study room, struggling to fight off sleepiness.
0:21:18|0:21:27|In the dim candlelight, a butterfly flew past her, briefly pausing on her shoulder before flying off into the distance.
0:21:27|0:21:31|[Chen Xiang] suddenly became playful and ran forward following the guidance of a butterfly.
0:21:31|0:21:36|Just as he ran a few steps, he suddenly remembered something, took out a handkerchief from his pocket and covered his face with it.
0:21:36|0:21:41|She ran and jumped all the way to a desolate palace.
0:21:41|0:21:48|Isn't this the palace I saw when I was a child? [Chen Xiang] retreated in horror.
0:21:48|0:21:52|A hand patted [Chen Xiang]'s shoulder, and [Chen Xiang] screamed and ran away.
0:21:54|0:22:0|She ran into the courtyard and hid behind an incense burner. When there was no movement around, she slowly stuck her head out.
0:22:1|0:22:6|She tiptoed out while nervously looking around.
0:22:24|0:22:34|[Yin Xiang] paid no attention to her response, his gaze already drawn to several butterflies flying overhead. Upon seeing this, [Chen Xiang] lit the lamps in the courtyard.
0:22:54|0:22:59|[Chen Xiang] held the candle and shook her head in confusion, while [Yin Xiang] fell into memories and spoke slowly.
0:23:37|0:23:51|[Yin Xiang] recalled the scene when his mother was taken away, closing his eyes in pain. Suddenly, [Chen Xiang] took out a jar behind him and handed it mysteriously to [Yin Xiang].
0:23:51|0:24:5|[Yin Xiang] was startled, but [Chen Xiang] smiled and took out a brush to tap on the jar. [Chen Xiang] dipped the brush in the liquid inside the jar and wrote and drew on the ground. [Yin Xiang] thought [Chen Xiang] was fooling around, so he smiled and looked away.
0:24:5|0:24:13|Who knew a butterfly would suddenly fly in front of them, [Yin Xiang] couldn't help but widen his eyes, staring incredulously at the butterfly.
0:24:13|0:24:21|The butterfly flapped its wings and slowly flew towards the direction where [Chen Xiang] was, but [Chen Xiang] didn't notice and continued to write with his head down.
0:24:21|0:24:28|When she saw the butterfly, she was not surprised, just reached out and caught it, saying.
0:24:28|0:24:40|Before long, a large group of butterflies flew over from a distance. Beside him, [Yin Xiang] was stunned, his eyes shining with astonishment, unable to close his mouth at the sight of the beautiful scene.
0:24:40|0:24:45|[Chen Xiang] stood beside [Yin Xiang], her eyes forming crescent moons as she waved at the butterflies.
0:24:45|0:24:51|The butterflies fluttered around and landed on the ground, forming the character "寿". [Yin Xiang] exclaimed in amazement.
0:24:54|0:25:2|[Chen Xiang] poked [Yin Xiang]'s mouth with a brush, and [Yin Xiang] quickly covered his mouth, suddenly realizing.
0:25:18|0:25:24|[Yin Xiang] realized that he had lost control and quickly let go of her, [Chen Xiang] turned around and ran away.
0:25:26|0:25:37|[Chen Xiang] was extremely shy and wanted to change the subject. She turned and ran towards the door of the palace, causing the smile on [Yin Xiang]'s face to suddenly disappear.
0:25:38|0:25:43|[Yin Xiang] remembered the girl he had seen when he was a child.
0:25:44|0:25:56|[Chen Xiang] was also stunned, seeing a glimpse of [Yin Xiang]'s childhood in front of her, she involuntarily walked towards [Yin Xiang], looking into his eyes.
0:25:58|0:26:4|He wanted to remove the handkerchief covering [Chen Xiang]'s face, but [Chen Xiang] was frightened by his actions and ran away.
0:26:4|0:26:8|The handkerchief accidentally fell on the ground, and was picked up by [Yin Xiang].
0:26:10|0:26:16|[Yin Xiang] looked up, and [Chen Xiang]'s figure had already disappeared, but he had already made up his mind.
0:26:25|0:26:36|[Chen Xiang] returned to the bedroom and lay down. [Liu Li] was still awake but had her back to [Chen Xiang], ignoring her calls. In her mind, scenes of the intimate moments with the Ninth Prince not long ago flashed back.
0:26:36|0:26:45|The two of them were lying on a pavilion in an empty hall, with all their clothes stripped off, naked and entwined together.
0:26:45|0:26:57|Liu Li's watery eyes were half-closed at this moment, feeling like she had finally made it through. Chen Xiang beside her remembered the encounter with the Thirteenth Prince tonight and couldn't help but smile.
0:27:8|0:27:16|In the Chu Xiu Palace, Empress De took a sip of water, and the servant beside her was holding the handkerchief that [Liu Li] used to cover [Chen Xiang]'s face on a tray.
0:27:17|0:27:24|Empress Dowager finished rinsing her mouth and continued,
0:27:47|0:27:54|Yin Xiang's expression darkened, he quickly knelt down, but remained silent, with no hint of wanting to admit his mistake on his face.
0:28:5|0:28:13|In the imperial garden, the palace maids hurried back and forth, [Liu Li] hid behind a tree with anticipation on her face, while [Yin Xi] walked over humming a tune.
0:28:51|0:29:6|[Liu Li] collapsed to the ground, grabbing onto Ninth Prince's leg as he kicked [Liu Li] away and walked away quickly. [Liu Li] walked back to the palace, tears streaming down her face.
0:29:21|0:29:27|At just one glance, [Liu Li] immediately recognized her own embroidery work, her heart stopping.
0:29:28|0:29:43|After finishing cleaning in the Ruyi Pavilion, [Chen Xiang] did not leave with everyone else. She looked around, carefully put down the broom, and with all her strength, moved the barrier in front of the painting in the center of the main hall. Underneath was the portrait of [Yin Xiang].
0:29:43|0:29:56|[Chen Xiang] gazed at the person in the painting with a silly smile, as if hearing the sound of warhorses in his ears. Just then, someone walked in behind him, and [Chen Xiang] slowly turned around.
0:29:56|0:30:2|Unexpectedly, the person who came turned out to be the Thirteenth Prince [Yin Xiang], leaving [Chen Xiang] stunned.
0:30:2|0:30:8|[Yin Xiang] seemed to be glowing from behind, looking at [Chen Xiang] with a smile in his eyes, so gentle that it could almost melt a person.
0:30:8|0:30:21|[Chen Xiang] stepped forward and embraced [Yin Xiang] around the waist, while [Yin Xiang] also embraced [Chen Xiang] around the waist. The two danced in place, looking into each other's eyes, bathed in a warm light, with smiles on their faces.
0:30:21|0:30:29|[Chen Xiang] closed her eyes and enjoyed the moment of joy. When she opened her eyes again, the person in front of her had turned into [Chun Shou].
0:31:34|0:31:39|Seeing [Chen Xiang], [Liu Li]'s expression became uneasy, and she walked out from the crowd.
0:31:39|0:31:45|[Chen Xiang] looked at [Liu Li] in disbelief with a cold face, and [Chun Shou] beside her did the same.
0:31:45|0:31:51|Back in the room, [Liu Li] knelt down in front of [Chen Xiang] with a thud.
0:32:40|0:32:49|The two embraced each other and wept bitterly. [Chen Xiang] thus handed over her position to others.
0:32:49|0:33:10|Only when the night is quiet can [Liu Li] sit alone at the edge of the bed until the sky turns silver, watching the busy servants for herself, with a satisfied smile on her face.
0:33:20|0:33:27|[Liu Li], dressed up, was escorted by [Chen Xiang] to meet the Empress Dowager, but [Yin Xiang] intercepted her on the way.
0:33:36|0:33:53|[Yin Xiang] noticed something unusual about [Liu Li], a hint of surprise flickering in his eyes, but he didn't suspect anything. Inside the main hall of Chuxiu Palace, [Liu Li] followed a group of concubines in a flustered manner, bowing and kneeling nervously.
0:33:59|0:34:4|[Liu Li]'s awkward and stiff movements drew laughter from the concubines, and Empress De slowly spoke.
0:34:28|0:34:34|The concubines' eyes were full of jealousy and disdain.
0:34:36|0:34:39|[Liu Li] was flattered but accidentally fell down, causing laughter.
0:35:5|0:35:20|The mentor aunt pressed the heavy hair accessory onto [Liu Li]'s head, while [Chen Xiang] stood by, her eyes full of pity.
0:35:20|0:35:37|Before long, [Liu Li] was dressed up as a noblewoman. After seeing [Liu Li], [Chen Xiang] pushed the door open, only to find the Thirteenth Prince standing at the doorway. She quickly turned and left.
0:36:14|0:36:21|[Chen Xiang] just wants to escape, but [Yin Xiang] doesn't give [Chen Xiang] the chance to leave.
0:36:23|0:36:33|[Chen Xiang] reluctantly walked up to the Thirteenth Prince with her head down, and had to sit down obediently. [Yin Xiang] handed her a piece of pastry.
0:36:34|0:36:43|Seeing [Chen Xiang] hesitating, [Yin Xiang] sternly said. Only then did [Chen Xiang] take the snack and took a big bite.
0:36:43|0:36:52|[Yin Xiang] is as happy as a child.
0:36:54|0:36:57|[Yin Xiang] looked at [Chen Xiang] with anticipation on his face.
0:38:15|0:38:23|Chun Shou speaks up for Chen Xiang, who sighs but doesn't want to ask for anything more. The next day, Chen Xiang is taken to the horse ranch by a eunuch.
0:38:25|0:38:33|The eunuch lowered his head and said nothing, then turned and quickly walked away. However, the sound of horse hooves could be heard behind [Chen Xiang].
0:38:34|0:38:46|Chen Xiang turned around and saw Thirteenth Prince riding a horse had already arrived in front of her, and with one hand, he lifted Chen Xiang up and placed her in front of him, causing Chen Xiang to scream in fright.
0:38:59|0:39:6|[Chen Xiang] turned and ran to the side, and [Yin Xiang] also came forward and squatted down.
0:40:6|0:40:11|[Yin Xiang] fixedly looked at [Chen Xiang].
0:40:12|0:40:24|[Chen Xiang] was stunned, but [Yin Xiang]'s face was getting closer and closer. [Chen Xiang] couldn't help but close her eyes.
0:41:6|0:41:13|At night, [Liu Li] sat in the bathtub with her eyes closed when the door suddenly pushed open.
0:41:46|0:41:54|[Yin Xiang] chuckled lightly and pulled out a silver token from behind.
0:42:26|0:42:29|Hearing Yin Xi's description, Liu Li immediately understood.
0:42:29|0:42:43|Not long after, [Chen Xiang] returned from the horse ranch. She ran back like a teenage girl in love, and when she entered her room, she saw [Liu Li] sitting at the table, smiling at her.
0:42:46|0:42:52|[Liu Li] stepped forward and said, placing a hand on [Chen Xiang]'s shoulder.
0:43:53|0:44:2|[Liu Li] left with a big smile, [Chen Xiang] couldn't believe that [Liu Li] had changed like this, and could only cover her mouth and cry silently.
0:44:2|0:44:9|In the corridor, [Yin Xiang] suddenly jumps out to play a prank.
0:44:35|0:44:38|[Liu Li] pursed her lips and smiled shallowly, feeling extremely pleased inside.
0:44:38|0:44:46|She now holds all the glory and wealth she desires in the palm of her hand, but all of these were taken from [Chen Xiang].
0:44:47|0:44:54|Winter arrived, and heavy snow covered the entire palace.
0:45:23|0:45:29|[Yin Xiang] is trying to mediate on the side, while [Liu Li] kneels down by the bed, looking troubled.
0:46:13|0:46:22|After Yin Xiang left, Liu Li's expression changed and she glared fiercely at Chen Xiang. That night, Yin Xi and Liu Li entwined on the bed.
0:46:24|0:46:33|[Liu Li] grabbed [Yin Xi]'s hand but was immediately pushed away.
0:46:52|0:46:59|[Chen Xiang] suddenly pushed the door open and saw [Liu Li] sitting on the bed, wearing only a bra.
0:46:59|0:47:9|[Liu Li] pretended to be calm, while also blocking her own wrist, [Yin Xi] broke out of the window, leaving [Chen Xiang] in shock.
0:47:29|0:47:42|The next day, [Yin Xiang] suddenly received a wind chime with words on it, while [Chen Xiang] was sitting at the table writing quickly.
0:48:36|0:48:43|After Yin Xiang walked away, Liu Li took a deep breath and gritted her teeth.
0:48:55|0:49:2|[Liu Li] turned around to look at [Chen Xiang].
0:49:16|0:49:21|[Liu Li] walked to the table, picked up the teacup, and then smashed it heavily on the ground.
0:50:6|0:50:15|[Chen Xiang] closed her eyes, trying hard to control her emotions, but her eyelashes kept trembling. When she opened her eyes again, hatred had filled them.
0:50:15|0:50:22|But at this moment, she was powerless to resist. The winter night came fast and chilling.
0:50:22|0:50:25|The Forbidden City has turned into a city of ice and snow glass.
0:50:25|0:50:39|[Chen Xiang] stood on the side of the road, covered in a thick layer of snow, shivering. Suddenly, there was a noise behind her. She turned around to see Yin Xiang, the thirteenth prince, and then she turned and ran frantically.
0:50:44|0:50:51|Chen Xiang's face was pale from the cold, with red eye sockets and tiny ice crystals forming on her eyelashes, evoking sympathy.
0:51:8|0:51:14|[Chen Xiang] felt like her heart was being twisted, but then she let out a sigh of relief. Just as she was about to leave, she suddenly turned around and hugged [Yin Xiang], saying, "..."
0:51:15|0:51:23|Chen Xiang's face was pressed against Yin Xiang's warm chest, and then reluctantly let go.
0:51:23|0:51:28|[Yin Xiang] lowered his head and looked at the close [Chen Xiang], a wave of emotion rising in his eyes.
0:51:28|0:51:35|[Chen Xiang] took a step back, a bright teardrop rolling down her face, then she flew away like a bird.
0:51:35|0:51:40|[Yin Xiang] stood still, feeling a strange sensation welling up in his heart.
0:51:41|0:51:48|On their wedding night, [Chen Xiang] shut out all mocking voices and turned to [Chun Shou].
0:52:44|0:52:51|[Chun Shou] cried helplessly, with bruises covering his face and body, a heartbreaking sight.
0:52:51|0:52:59|Chen Xiang is adding hot water for him on the side.
0:53:5|0:53:9|[Chun Shou] cried even harder at the words. [Chen Xiang] squatted by the water basin,
0:53:9|0:53:16|Although she didn't say a word, [Chen Xiang] couldn't help but cover her mouth and start sobbing, her body shaking uncontrollably.
0:53:53|0:54:2|The Emperor's eyes finally showed a hint of comfort, as he slowly stood up and walked towards [Yin Xiang], raising his hand.
0:54:10|0:54:20|The other brothers knelt on the ground, not daring to move.
0:54:20|0:54:27|Fourth Prince's face was dark, and the Crown Prince was even more indignant. The capital was bustling during the day, with the Crown Prince walking alone in the crowd.
0:54:31|0:54:36|Complaining on one side, while throwing money into the beggar's bowl beside him.
0:54:37|0:54:53|Suddenly attracted by the opera music nearby, [Yin Xi] took off his opera costume, handed it to the old man, and then bid farewell with a bow.
0:54:53|0:55:2|[Yin Xiang] looked puzzled outside the door, unable to contain his curiosity and sneaked in to take a peek, only to be discovered by the old man by coincidence.
0:55:16|0:55:20|[Yin Xiang] looked around for a moment, then poured a bag of gold ingots onto the table.
0:55:21|0:55:28|The old man was taken aback, [Yin Xiang] stared at him and said.
0:55:51|0:56:14|As soon as the emperor finished speaking, the surroundings became noisy with the sound of gongs and drums. A group of eunuchs carrying lanterns quickly walked over from the side steps and stood in two rows. Several people in opera costumes holding flags rushed out, with [Yin Xiang] standing in the middle. He was dressed as Sun Wukong and sang in a spirited manner.
0:56:51|0:56:57|[Yin Xiang] knelt on the ground in confusion, until he saw the triumphant look in [Yin Xi]'s eyes beside him and realized that he had been tricked.
0:57:8|0:57:15|[Yin Xi] frowned at the words and placed the chess piece in his hand.
0:58:7|0:58:18|[Yin Xiang] was shocked when he heard the words, turned his back to the silver needle, panic filling his face. Then, as if making a decision, he suddenly turned around and spoke.
0:58:27|0:58:34|The night in the Forbidden City was eerily quiet, [Chen Xiang] stood in the courtyard lost in thought, and quickly hid when she heard footsteps approaching.
0:58:35|0:58:45|[Yin Xiang] approached the palace gate step by step but did not enter, muttering to himself with a heart full of concerns.
0:58:54|0:59:2|Late at night, [Liu Li] followed [Yin Xiang]'s instructions and hid in the dark corners of the imperial garden. She carefully moved through the bushes, afraid of being discovered by the patrolling palace guards.
0:59:58|1:0:7|After listening to Yin Xiang's words, Chen Xiang was stunned. Yin Xiang then turned around and left.
1:0:8|1:0:15|After leaving the Yanxi Palace, [Chen Xiang] walked heavily along the corridor, lost in thought, when suddenly she heard whispers coming from nearby.
1:0:15|1:0:23|She followed the sound and quietly arrived at the Moon Gate cave, looking up to see [Liu Li] and [Yin Xi].
1:0:35|1:0:39|The two turned their heads at the sound and saw the slender figure fleeing in a panic, [Liu Li] exclaimed.
1:0:42|1:0:48|[Chen Xiang] didn't dare to hesitate at all, running frantically along the palace corridor, searching for the figure of the thirteenth prince.
1:0:48|1:0:59|She ran outside the palace and found that the Thirteenth Prince was no longer there. She quickly turned back and finally saw [Yin Xiang] in a corridor. Without hesitation, [Chen Xiang] chased after him.
1:1:0|1:1:10|At this moment, as Empress Yi's colorful canopy passed by, the palace maids had to step aside and bow. [Chen Xiang] retreated to the side, but her eyes were fixed firmly on the Thirteenth Prince.
1:1:11|1:1:17|However, when [Chen Xiang] caught up again, the Thirteenth Prince had already left the palace gates, and [Chen Xiang] was stopped by the guards.
1:1:17|1:1:26|She had a sudden inspiration and climbed up to the nearby high building. She shouted towards the distance, but a strong hand covered [Chen Xiang]'s mouth and dragged her away.
1:1:26|1:1:32|[Yin Xiang] turned his head at the sound, thinking he was hearing things, and then left.
1:1:56|1:2:10|The emperor put on a helmet and mask made of gold, while [Yin Xiang] and [Yin Xi] wore silver helmets. The father and son rode horses galloping on the hunting ground, followed by a large group of attendants. Several roe deer startled and ran past, [Yin Xiang] raised his bow and arrow and shouted.
1:2:22|1:2:27|[Yin Xi] heard the words and led a group of followers to sneak into the nearby jungle, their figures gradually disappearing.
1:2:27|1:2:32|[Yin Xiang] glanced sideways slightly, looking at the empty space beside him, feeling that this was a rare opportunity that comes once in a thousand years.
1:2:33|1:2:38|He pretended to be calm, secretly broke away from the team, letting the emperor chase after him like a wild horse.
1:2:38|1:2:45|Four men in black riding horses are approaching from a distance, each holding a weapon and carrying a quiver, heading towards the depths of the forest.
1:2:45|1:2:51|The emperor shook off his attendants and chased after the roe deer alone, unaware that he had fallen into a trap.
1:2:52|1:2:59|At the moment he shot the arrow, four black-clothed men had already surrounded him.
1:3:6|1:3:18|Before the words could finish, the black-clothed men around were shot down by arrows from a distance. In an instant, the soldiers ambushed around surrounded [Yin Xiang] and others, leaving no way out. The Emperor appeared among the soldiers with a cold expression on his face.
1:3:19|1:3:30|[Yin Xiang] looked at him in horror and shock, before he could react, the fake emperor in front of him shot an arrow to shatter his mask, causing him to black out. The fake emperor took off the mask, revealing himself to be [Yin Xi].
1:3:41|1:3:48|[Yin Xiang] was escorted by the guards, his eyes covered and his clothes dirty.
1:4:18|1:4:29|Yin Xi's face turned ugly, wanting to get angry but unable to do so, allowing Liu Li to gloat. Seeing Yin Xi in a daze, Liu Li suddenly stepped forward and fiercely bit his lips.
1:4:29|1:4:36|[Yin Xi] struggled to push away [Liu Li], blood already oozing from his mouth.
1:4:38|1:4:42|[Yin Xi] wiped the blood off his mouth and smiled sinisterly.
1:4:43|1:4:49|In the Yanxi Palace, the Emperor stood in the main hall, staring blankly at the rusty golden cage in front of him.
1:4:50|1:4:54|Before my eyes appeared the graceful demeanor of the late Empress Min.
1:5:6|1:5:19|Empress Min stood by the lake with her maid, unaware of the Emperor behind her. She smiled and reached out her hand, as both wrists lightly turned, a golden dragon appeared and spiraled up into the night sky.
1:5:19|1:5:24|The emperor and the attendants around him all widened their eyes in fear, and they were so scared that they knelt down on the ground.
1:5:54|1:6:0|The emperor, enduring the pain, made up his mind, and the guards picked up the cold spears and stabbed into the body of Concubine Min.
1:6:7|1:6:15|The Emperor's face turned pale suddenly, filled with deep regret.
1:6:15|1:6:35|Long-sealed memories suddenly opened, the emperor couldn't help but shed tears again. Empress Dowager unexpectedly appeared behind the emperor, her eyes full of tenderness. The emperor looked at her, wanting to say something, but it turned into a long sigh. A bucket of ice water poured down on [Chen Xiang]'s head.
1:6:48|1:6:55|[Liu Li] pushes [Chen Xiang] to the ground, glaring fiercely.
1:6:58|1:7:3|[Liu Li] crouched down, grabbing [Chen Xiang]'s collar, his eyes filled with intense hatred.
1:7:3|1:7:9|She gasped for breath, her beautiful face contorted into a fierce expression, raising her hand to touch [Chen Xiang]'s cheek and said.
1:7:22|1:7:29|[Chen Xiang] looked up at the unfamiliar [Liu Li] with sadness in her eyes, overshadowing the fear. The two of them arrived at the door.
1:7:38|1:7:51|In front of the gate, the long corridor was covered with burning hot black charcoal, crackling. [Chen Xiang] remained calm, bending down to take off his shoes and socks, revealing his bare feet without hesitation as he stepped into the piercingly cold snow.
1:7:51|1:7:57|[Liu Li] stared at the back of [Chen Xiang], with the palace maids and nannies behind her standing in a row, not daring to make a sound.
1:7:58|1:8:10|[Chen Xiang] stopped in front of the charcoal fire, [Liu Li] turned her head disdainfully, thinking she wouldn't dare to approach. But then she saw [Chen Xiang] slowly lift her snow-covered foot and step onto the charcoal fire, bit by bit.
1:8:10|1:8:22|[Liu Li] took a quick glance and was shocked by [Chen Xiang]'s actions, showing an expression of disbelief. [Chen Xiang] opened his mouth in pain, but could only make a hoarse hissing sound, gritting his teeth and staggering forward.
1:8:22|1:8:27|The attendants behind [Liu Li] all looked up at [Chen Xiang], frowning and unable to meet her gaze.
1:8:28|1:8:34|[Chun Shou] stood in the distance, looking at everything with a heart full of pain and tears streaming down his face, but hating himself for being powerless.
1:8:34|1:8:40|Watching [Chen Xiang] walk to the other side of the corridor, [Liu Li] had slightly red eyes, filled with more than just hatred.
1:8:40|1:8:45|[Chen Xiang] sat on the ground with a pale face.
1:8:57|1:9:4|[Chun Shou] bribed the guard of the Zongren Mansion, taking care of everything for [Chen Xiang]. The Zongren Mansion was desolate in the winter.
1:9:4|1:9:13|The withered branches are covered with snow, and crows are cawing nearby. [Chen Xiang] limps into the courtyard with a frail body.
1:9:14|1:9:22|Bare feet stepped on the snow as if they had lost all sensation. She leaned against the stone pillar and took small steps forward.
1:9:23|1:9:28|Having forgotten the pain in his body, Chen Xiang's heart and eyes were filled with concern for the Thirteenth Prince.
1:9:29|1:9:43|She walked into the shop and looked around, [Yin Xiang] suddenly emerged from the shadows. [Chen Xiang] turned her head in response and found [Yin Xiang] lying despondently on the bed.
1:9:55|1:10:12|[Yin Xiang] stood still, although blind, his eyes were shining. He got off the bed and ran towards [Chen Xiang]. [Chen Xiang] hurried forward to support the stumbling [Yin Xiang], and then he was tightly embraced by him. [Yin Xiang] caressed [Chen Xiang]'s face.
1:10:19|1:10:29|[Yin Xiang] couldn't help but hug [Chen Xiang] again.
1:10:52|1:10:57|[Chen Xiang] didn't know whether to be happy or sad, just nodded silently.
1:10:57|1:11:6|[Yin Xiang] smiled and embraced her, and [Chen Xiang] agreed haphazardly, without considering the consequences, as long as Thirteenth Prince was happy.
1:11:6|1:11:12|After returning, [Chen Xiang] enthusiastically started preparing various foods to bring to the thirteenth prince.
1:11:12|1:11:27|[Chen Xiang] has already gotten up and started to busy herself. [Chun Shou] follows behind her, drooling with desire. [Chun Shou] picks up a piece of cabbage and puts it into her mouth.
1:11:28|1:11:38|[Chen Xiang] was anxious and hopping mad, while [Chun Shou] continued to eat leisurely.
1:11:55|1:12:3|The guards at the Zongren Mansion suddenly changed their attitude, refusing to let Chen Xiang in no matter what. They pushed her, causing her to fall in the rain, with the food in her lunch box scattered all over the ground.
1:12:4|1:12:13|[Chen Xiang] felt heartbroken and cried in despair. Just then, a royal physician walked out from the ancestral mansion. [Chen Xiang] eyes lit up and she got up to follow him.
1:12:52|1:13:9|The imperial physician led [Chen Xiang] into a dark passage, pushing open one secret door after another. In [Chen Xiang]'s resolute eyes, a hint of fear towards the unknown could not be concealed, surrounded by moving copper walls and iron barriers. The imperial physician pushed open the final door, revealing a secret chamber.
1:13:36|1:13:42|In front of them, the statue suddenly transformed into a door that slowly opened, revealing a huge pool of water.
1:13:43|1:13:50|The dragon heads on both sides of the pool kept spouting water, making the liquid in the pool extremely murky.
1:13:51|1:13:55|The imperial physician stood behind her, urging her on with a cold and indifferent expression.
1:13:55|1:14:2|[Chen Xiang] closed his eyes tightly, the smile of the Thirteenth Prince appearing in his mind, which inspired him.
1:14:5|1:14:13|[Liu Li] suddenly appeared at the door, walked quickly to [Chen Xiang]'s front, and [Chen Xiang] turned her head in confusion.
1:14:37|1:14:43|[Chen Xiang] looked at [Liu Li], tears streaming down her face, reminiscing about the intimate years they once shared.
1:14:43|1:14:49|While being moved, [Liu Li] let out a cold laugh, and his facial expression gradually twisted.
1:14:50|1:15:6|[Chen Xiang] immediately looked down in a hurry, only to find [Liu Li] holding a curved knife about to stab her. To her surprise, she was not stabbed as expected, but instead floated to the surface, surrounded by deformed specimens crawling around the pool. It turned out that it was all an illusion.
1:15:8|1:15:15|In the evening, the night market in the capital city is still bustling, with a mysterious man weaving through the crowded streets.
1:15:15|1:15:20|In a flustered manner, Chen Xiang hurriedly ran to a table next to a snack stall.
1:15:21|1:15:27|He leaned in close to [Yin Xi]'s ear and whispered something, but [Yin Xi] remained calm and continued to drink his soup.
1:15:27|1:15:39|Before long, [Yin Xi] felt his way to a theater, where eerie puppets hung in the room, looking very frightening. Although finding it strange, [Yin Xi] did not retreat, but carefully observed his surroundings.
1:15:40|1:15:45|Suddenly, the hat on top of his head was pulled away by an invisible force, leaving [Yin Xi] shocked.
1:15:46|1:15:52|An old man appeared in the corner holding a white hat.
1:16:20|1:16:36|The surrounding puppets have started talking, their voices echoing in the room. [Yin Xi] showed no fear and couldn't help but burst into laughter. Late at night, [Chen Xiang], who had been tormented, finally broke free and headed straight to the ancestral mansion. [Yin Xiang], however, remained hidden in the darkness.
1:16:48|1:16:55|[Chen Xiang] turned around to leave, but [Yin Xiang] pulled her back.
1:17:11|1:17:19|[Chen Xiang] was extremely scared, pushing away the already crazed [Yin Xiang], and frantically adjusting her own collar.
1:17:19|1:17:26|Chen Xiang's fierce resistance seemed to pour cold water on Yin Xiang, who turned around and knelt on the ground, sobbing in pain.
1:17:38|1:17:50|[Chen Xiang] came to her senses and saw the pitiful Thirteenth Prince looking like a trapped animal, her heart ached. She couldn't help but rush forward, bend down, and whispered softly in [Yin Xiang]'s ear.
1:17:51|1:18:6|[Yin Xiang], with red eyes, was about to lift his head when [Chen Xiang]'s warm and moist lips gently landed on his cheek. [Yin Xiang]'s breath hitched, but soon he took control of the situation. With a cry of surprise from [Chen Xiang], [Yin Xiang] pinned her down beneath him. As the snowstorm passed, the sky gradually brightened.
1:18:38|1:18:47|Seeing [Yin Xiang] smiling sweetly, [Yin Xi]'s expression changed. He let out a long sigh and said.
1:18:49|1:18:54|Not long after, [Chen Xiang] walked into the ancestral mansion as usual with a food box in her arms, but her smile was particularly bright.
1:19:33|1:19:38|[Yin Xiang] slowly felt his way out of the door. [Chen Xiang] wanted to explain but didn't know where to start.
1:19:49|1:19:57|Chen Xiang was hurt by these words and couldn't help but slap Yin Xiang.
1:20:29|1:20:53|[Yin Xiang]'s cold and ruthless tone pierced [Chen Xiang]'s heart like a knife. She felt completely hopeless, nodding blankly. A big tear fell from her right eye as she looked up at [Yin Xiang]'s face, then quickly averted her gaze and hurriedly left as if escaping. [Yin Xiang] stood still in place. He thought he would feel relieved, but instead he couldn't help but feel heartache.
1:20:53|1:21:1|Night falls, and the imperial physician rushes out of the Qianqing Palace, accidentally falling to the ground, then quickly getting up and running up the stairs ahead.
1:21:4|1:21:8|[Yin Xi] in full armor, reached out and interrupted the imperial physician's words.
1:21:9|1:21:14|He turned around with a cold laugh, and the soldiers behind him immediately understood, getting ready for action.
1:21:15|1:21:20|The imperial physician was dumbfounded, too scared to move as he watched a large group of soldiers about to rush into the Qianqing Palace gates.
1:21:21|1:21:30|The army marched in a mighty manner under the leadership of the Ninth Prince, determined to seize the throne. Soon, the palace gates were successfully opened.
1:21:32|1:21:36|The soldiers behind locked the palace gate, and [Yin Xi] led a team straight to the main hall.
1:21:37|1:21:45|At this moment, the Fourth Prince [Yin Xi] sat in the hall calmly playing the qin, facing a crisis but remaining composed as he spoke slowly.
1:22:22|1:22:34|Upon hearing this, everyone stopped in their tracks and looked at each other, hesitating to move forward. The soldiers outside the palace, unaware of the situation inside, were quickly surrounded and panicked.
1:23:51|1:23:58|Outside the palace, there is continuous gunfire, but inside, no one dares to move.
1:23:58|1:24:6|[Yin Xi] angrily drew his sword towards [Yin Xiang], and the Emperor on the dragon throne suddenly sat up straight.
1:24:29|1:24:36|The Emperor was manipulated like a puppet, with a figure swaying behind him. Before he could finish speaking, he collapsed onto the bed.
1:25:9|1:25:17|As soon as the words fell, the doors of Ganqing Palace slowly opened, and [Yin Xi] turned his head to realize that the situation was already lost, closing his eyes in despair.
1:25:55|1:26:4|The lamas played their instruments and left the Ganqing Palace, restoring silence in an instant.
1:26:5|1:26:11|[Yin Xi] stood under the spotlight in front of the dragon throne, his gloomy face exuding unquestionable dignity.
1:26:11|1:26:18|In the year 1722 AD, the Qing Emperor Kangxi passed away, and his fourth son [Yin Zhen] ascended the throne, with the reign title Yongzheng.
1:26:18|1:26:26|With a pair of aged hands holding the imperial seal, the new emperor's coronation ceremony began as the last stroke of the edict was pressed down.
1:26:26|1:26:37|Following the command of the official, Emperor [Yongzheng] walked out of the hall in a dragon robe, and the courtiers began to perform the three kneels and nine kowtows ceremony.
1:26:58|1:27:7|[Yongzheng] ascended the throne and immediately conferred the title of Prince Yi on the Thirteenth Prince. The hereditary title was passed down,
1:27:7|1:27:25|The once desolate and bleak Zongren Mansion is now bustling with activity, filled with attendants. The imperial physician is busy administering acupuncture to [Yin Xiang] on the bed, with a sense of trepidation. The Emperor stands calmly by the side, waiting. After the treatment, the physician removes the cloth from [Yin Xiang]'s eyes, then nods to the Emperor.
1:27:25|1:27:31|[Yin Xiang] frowned, avoiding the sunlight streaming in through the window, slowly opening his eyes.
1:27:32|1:27:40|He staggered to his feet, his vision gradually clearing from a blur to a focus, finally recognizing the person in front of him, [Yin Xiang] exclaimed.
1:27:41|1:27:56|The emperor was overjoyed, unable to contain his laughter. With everything settled, the cold winter gradually faded away, making room for the spring flowers blooming in the palace.
1:27:56|1:28:8|Under the trees of Qianqing Palace, a group of palace maids were playing and laughing merrily, but [Chen Xiang] sat by the window lost in thought, while [Chun Shou] hurried over to deliver a message.
1:28:38|1:28:44|[Chun Shou]'s words seemed to pour salt on [Chen Xiang]'s wound, and [Chen Xiang] didn't want to hear anymore, turning and fleeing.
1:28:44|1:28:58|She walked onto a small bridge and saw [Yin Xiang] in gorgeous attire approaching confidently. As usual, [Chen Xiang] dared not look directly at him and quickly avoided him.
1:29:16|1:29:24|The Emperor leaned down and lifted [Liu Li]'s chin, his eyes becoming even colder. [Liu Li] trembled in fear and spoke.
1:29:26|1:29:30|The emperor couldn't help but sneer.
1:29:30|1:29:36|He turned and left, leaving [Liu Li] alone kneeling in the side hall, his wide eyes filled with fear.
1:29:36|1:29:49|[Liu Li] knew that there was no hope left and wanted to escape from the palace. She mingled with the group leaving the palace, but the guards behind her were very alert.
1:29:59|1:30:7|Yin Xiang's expression was complex. After dismissing the guards, he looked at Liu Li kneeling on the ground. Liu Li remained silent, showing no fear.
1:30:25|1:30:32|[Yin Xiang] thought she was just sulking, and lowered her head to say with great restraint,
1:31:6|1:31:14|At this moment, [Liu Li] disregarded everything, even if it meant sacrificing everything for the greater good.
1:31:14|1:31:21|[Yin Xiang] slowly released his fingers, despite being furious, he felt helpless.
1:31:34|1:31:41|Liu Li's face was covered in tears, suddenly turned to look at Yin Xiang, and put on a charming smile.
1:32:5|1:32:12|[Liu Li] pushed [Yin Xiang] away with all her strength, laughed triumphantly, and then turned around and jumped onto the horse.
1:32:12|1:32:29|Despite the fierce smile, [Liu Li] still had a hint of unwilling tears in her eyes. She spurred her horse and galloped away, the outside world within reach. Suddenly, the city tower was filled with imperial guards, arrows shot simultaneously, and in an instant, [Liu Li] was turned into a hedgehog, the light in her eyes disappearing instantly.
1:32:29|1:32:38|She fell heavily from the horse and landed on the ground. Beside her, [Yin Xiang] was shocked, and turned around to see the Emperor standing on the city tower, indifferent to what was happening in front of him.
1:32:38|1:32:50|[Yin Xiang] ran up and helped the bloodied [Liu Li] up from the ground, as [Liu Li] coughed up blood with weak breath.
1:32:51|1:32:57|As soon as the words fell, [Liu Li]'s energy was drained away, but her big eyes remained wide open.
1:32:57|1:33:5|Scheming to the end, but ultimately losing the trust of others, even at the cost of one's life, that was the brief life of [Liu Li].
1:33:5|1:33:11|At night, the fire flickered in the corner at the end of the corridor.
1:33:26|1:33:32|[Chen Xiang] puts the paper money into the incense burner, and [Chun Shou] suddenly exclaims as he looks at the distant sky.
1:33:34|1:33:40|[Chen Xiang] was startled and quickly turned his head, only to be attracted by something floating in the night sky.
1:33:40|1:33:50|The two of them, Chen Xiang and Yin Xiang, didn't care about burning the paper money, and chased after each other all the way to the bottom of the wall. Looking up, they saw a sky lantern slowly rising into the sky.
1:33:50|1:34:6|In the imperial garden, [Yin Xiang] stood by the lake as several palace maids busily released one sky lantern after another into the sky. Each lantern was adorned with a written scroll, creating a dazzling display of lights reflecting on the water surface.
1:34:35|1:34:40|[Chen Xiang] had a hint of a smile in her eyes, and hope reignited in her heart.
1:34:40|1:34:49|She turned and ran away, while [Chun Shou] stood still with a desolate look. [Chen Xiang] made up her mind and decided to be brave, returning to the room to start grooming and dressing up.
1:34:58|1:35:9|[Chen Xiang] put the single earring into the box, took a deep breath nervously. She touched the hair accessory on her head, looking radiant.
1:35:9|1:35:18|On her face was the shy and hopeful look of a young girl in love. [Chun Shou] raised her hand to help him tidy his hair, with a gentle look in her eyes, genuinely happy for her from the bottom of her heart.
1:35:18|1:35:25|Four palace maids stood outside the door, holding lanterns.
1:35:27|1:35:35|[Chen Xiang] froze, nervously swallowed, hesitant to ask more despite her confusion. She arrived at the Qianqing Palace, kneeling anxiously on the ground.
1:37:10|1:37:25|The Emperor turned and left, [Chen Xiang] knelt in the hall, her delicate and petite body trembling slightly, tears silently falling to the ground.
1:37:48|1:37:59|In the imperial garden, [Yin Xiang] clasped his hands together in prayer, eagerly anticipating the reunion with his beloved.
1:38:2|1:38:7|Chen Xiang's heart seemed to be tortured inch by inch, silent tears gradually turning into loud wails.
1:38:8|1:38:13|She bit her lip tightly, tears streaming down her face, soaking her cheeks.
1:38:13|1:38:24|Recalling that night at the Zongren Mansion, the two of them were tightly nestled together, the warmth of that moment seemed within reach, but now it was gradually slipping away with Chen Xiang's tears.
1:38:24|1:38:34|The long night has passed, and as the dawn breaks into the hall, [Chen Xiang]'s tears have dried up, leaving her eyes devoid of any color.
1:38:34|1:38:40|At this moment, [Yin Xiang] still maintained the gesture of clasping his hands together, but the hope in his eyes was gradually fading.
1:39:33|1:39:42|[Chen Xiang] nodded and lowered her eyes, no longer speaking. [Chen Xiang] distributed the gold to everyone.
1:39:52|1:39:57|When the aunt arrived, everyone scattered in a panic, leaving only a dozen gold ingots in [Chen Xiang]'s hands.
1:40:0|1:40:18|Aunt refused to accept the gold ingot from [Chen Xiang], a few words made [Chen Xiang] tearful eyes smile and nod. Aunt, as usual, was serious and indifferent, even her eyes turned red as she walked away. [Chen Xiang] turned and went to [Chun Shou]'s side.
1:40:48|1:40:55|Chen Xiang is still unable to let go of the relationship with Yin Xiang, which is so fateful.
1:40:56|1:41:2|In the late night, the Zongren Mansion was dark and cold, with only a faint moonlight shining into the courtyard.
1:41:2|1:41:8|[Chen Xiang] changed into civilian clothes and quietly walked in with a dim lantern in hand.
1:41:9|1:41:15|She stepped into the room where [Yin Xiang] had lived, looking around at the furnishings that were almost identical to those in her memories.
1:41:16|1:41:25|The dusty memories were gradually opened up as far as the eye could see, and the once shared happy moments were now vividly displayed like a dream.
1:41:57|1:42:4|The scenes and events that unfolded along the way in this deep palace all flooded her mind, causing her immense heartache. 
1:42:4|1:42:23|At this moment, a familiar voice suddenly came from behind. [Chen Xiang] trembled, almost dropping the lantern in his hand. He turned around and looked towards the figure that was faintly visible in the darkness. It wasn't until then that [Chen Xiang] realized it was not an illusion and asked, "Who's there?"
1:42:46|1:42:52|[Yin Xiang]'s heartfelt confession fell into [Chen Xiang]'s ears, turning into strings of tears sliding down her face.
1:42:52|1:42:59|However, she became timid again, dropped the lantern and ran towards the door, determined to escape.
1:43:0|1:43:6|[Yin Xiang] took [Chen Xiang] into his arms before tearing off the cloth in front of him.
1:43:38|1:43:45|Chen Xiang, despite being nervous, was charmed by Yin Xiang's gentleness, and couldn't help but lower her head and smile lightly. Yin Xiang asked.
1:43:48|1:43:59|In the blink of an eye, the two held hands tightly, passed through the archway, and ran through the corridor. [Yin Xiang] pulled [Chen Xiang] forward, with a childlike smile on his face, occasionally looking back at her affectionately.
1:43:59|1:44:5|[Chen Xiang] smiled like a flower, her eyes fixed on [Yin Xiang] and unwilling to move away.
1:44:5|1:44:13|Before long, the two arrived at the entrance of the Yanxi Palace, with [Yin Xiang] continuing to speak with a smile.
