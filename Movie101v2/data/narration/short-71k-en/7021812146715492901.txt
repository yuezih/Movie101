0:2:2|0:2:8|He then exerted force to prop up his upper body and sat up. He then walked outside.
0:2:21|0:2:29|Looking at the calm lake, the man looked up at the sky and lit a cigarette. With this, the movie "Extraordinary Mission" officially begins.
0:2:29|0:2:34|The scene cuts to [Lin Kai] washing his face, then he hears a noise.
0:2:36|0:2:43|He is actually called [Lin Kai], staring at the dirty mirror, gazing at himself. In the dimly lit room, the man with a beard,
0:2:43|0:2:51|Took out several packages of things resembling flour from the cabinet, and handed the list in his hand to the young man opposite.
0:2:52|0:3:0|The young man quickly put away the powdery small package and paper into his backpack, then bowed to the bearded man.
0:3:0|0:3:2|Then turned around and left the room.
0:3:2|0:3:7|It looks like he is one of the henchmen of the bearded man.
0:3:17|0:3:24|Lin Kai's henchman, carrying a bag, walked through the narrow passage towards them.
0:3:42|0:3:49|[Lin Kai] takes the list from Bin Ge's hands.
0:3:50|0:3:56|Seeing [Lin Kai] putting the powdery substance into his backpack, [Li Jianguo] ordered.
0:3:58|0:4:6|[Li Jianguo] smiled and watched as the others left, then walked over to [Lin Kai] who was packing up the trunk.
0:4:6|0:4:8|After speaking, [Lin Kai] walked around to the driver's seat and got into the car.
0:4:10|0:4:18|On the other side, the bearded man sat on the boss chair, took out a phone from his pocket, put it to his ear, and spoke softly.
0:4:19|0:4:24|On the rugged and dark mountain road, only the cars of [Li Jianguo] and [Lin Kai] were driving one after the other.
0:4:24|0:4:33|[Li Jianguo] took a drag of his cigarette, casually glanced at the rearview mirror, then stuck his hand out of the window to signal [Lin Kai] to split up at the upcoming fork in the road.
0:4:34|0:4:43|So [Lin Kai] made a sharp turn and headed downhill. [Li Jianguo] glanced at the rearview mirror, took a puff of smoke, and said.
0:5:3|0:5:9|Glancing in the rearview mirror, [Lin Kai] suddenly turned around and saw the police car approaching him.
0:5:9|0:5:17|He was about to step on the gas and drive away, but he saw a temporary roadblock at the bridge ahead. So he had no choice but to drive forward with determination.
0:5:33|0:5:42|[Lin Kai] raised his hands, turned around and lay on the car. The police searched him, while others checked the trunk and found a tire.
0:5:44|0:5:50|At this moment, the black bag leaked out, and one of the police officers walked towards [Lin Kai] holding something.
0:5:57|0:6:2|After speaking, the police officer took out the handcuffs.
0:6:2|0:6:6|At that moment, [Lin Kai] suddenly turned around, swiftly threw a punch, and knocked the opponent to the ground.
0:6:6|0:6:13|Lin Kai then jogged to the car, swiftly shifted gears, and started drifting in place.
0:6:16|0:6:22|[Lin Kai] took advantage of the chaos, pushed open the car door, bent down to pick up the small bag, accelerated to crash through the roadblock, and immediately rushed forward.
0:6:22|0:6:27|The police first fired a warning shot upon seeing the situation, then chased after them in a car.
0:6:27|0:6:32|On the narrow and pitch-black mountain road, [Lin Kai] drove while keeping an eye on the rearview mirror.
0:6:32|0:6:38|At this moment, a police car accelerated and arrived on his right side, while another one ruthlessly crashed into the back of the car.
0:6:38|0:6:46|Three cars maintained the appearance of encirclement and drove forward at high speed. Suddenly, the police car on the right forcefully rammed to the left.
0:6:46|0:6:49|In an instant, [Lin Kai]'s car was fiercely rammed into the roadside curb.
0:6:50|0:6:58|The police pursued aggressively, once again exerting force, and the left side of [Lin Kai]'s car was lifted directly, resting on the concrete guardrail, continuing to move forward.
0:6:58|0:7:5|As he was about to fall off the cliff, [Lin Kai] forcefully turned the steering wheel to the right, stepped on the gas pedal hard, and broke free from the restraints.
0:7:6|0:7:13|Who knew, just as he entered the curve, his car was rammed on the left side by a police car, and then, he was directly pushed towards the edge of the road.
0:7:13|0:7:17|In the end, [Lin Kai], along with the car, uncontrollably rolled off the cliff.
0:7:17|0:7:29|After a cloud of dust settled, the night returned to tranquility. Subsequently, several police officers holding flashlights cautiously slid down the hillside and approached the car of [Lin Kai].
0:7:33|0:7:39|The driver's seat was unexpectedly empty. The scene then shifted to a dimly lit lumber mill.
0:7:39|0:7:45|At this moment, two men are standing on the open ground.
0:7:55|0:8:2|The man with short hair is shouting angrily at the man with a beard.
0:8:17|0:8:24|The man with short hair, also known as the leader, listened and then squinted at the man with a beard, before turning away disdainfully.
0:8:24|0:8:38|After gently pursing his lips, [Lin Kai] spoke. The spotlight shone on the luxurious car behind the leader, and the man with a beard lowered his head in contemplation.
0:8:38|0:8:43|Stomping his foot in place, he then turned around and walked into the narrow passage behind him.
0:8:43|0:8:58|Shortly after, he walked out carrying a leather bag, slowly approaching the leader. He unzipped it and showed him the contents inside. After seeing it, the leader took a step back.
0:9:1|0:9:6|The scene cuts back to the dimly lit room, where [Li Jianguo] is knocked over by a stool.
0:9:15|0:9:24|The man with a beard gritted his teeth and cursed angrily. Yi Ge, also known as the man with a beard, squatted down.
0:9:39|0:9:41|[Li Jianguo] quickly got up, opened the door, and fled in panic.
0:9:41|0:9:43|Late at night, Lin Kai, Laoying, Li Jianguo, and Qingshui were gathered around a table.
0:9:43|0:9:52|Yige gently opened the door and returned home, then dragged his weary body up to the second floor. His wife was sitting on the sofa.
0:9:52|0:9:53|He looked at him in pain.
0:9:55|0:10:3|Yige first looked puzzled towards the room on the left, where he found his daughter sleeping soundly, then turned his head and looked at his wife in confusion.
0:10:6|0:10:11|Suddenly he stopped, at the end of the corridor, [Lin Kai] was devouring noodles hungrily.
0:10:12|0:10:20|Seeing [Li Jianguo] finally recognizing himself, [Lin Kai] slowly put down the bowl, then picked up the pistol from the table and played with it slowly.
0:10:20|0:10:25|Lin Kai relaxed and leaned back on the sofa, staring intently at the other person.
0:10:25|0:10:34|Seeing [Lin Kai]'s casual demeanor, [Li Jianguo] cautiously moved his feet and came to the deep end of the corridor, sitting on a chair a few steps away from him.
0:10:58|0:11:4|He then slowly sat up from the sofa, leaning slightly forward.
0:11:6|0:11:14|Next, [Lin Kai] put down the gun in his hand and picked up the small bag next to him, throwing it over.
0:11:14|0:11:22|Li Jianguo caught it and took a look inside. It was not something else, but exactly the powdery substance that Bin had given Lin Kai before.
0:11:22|0:11:31|It seems like drugs now. He looked up in astonishment at this point, then smirked at [Lin Kai].
0:11:31|0:11:38|The scene changes, it's getting dark. In an abandoned building complex filled with garbage and construction materials, a sedan,
0:11:38|0:11:45|Stopped in front of one of the dilapidated buildings. Then, a man wearing glasses got out of the driver's seat,
0:11:46|0:11:55|After looking around, [Lin Kai] walked towards the direction of the building. Inside the spacious and damp building, the ground was covered with puddles and potholes.
0:11:56|0:12:4|At this moment, rain was pouring down from the sky, passing through the abandoned building and directly hitting Lin Kai. As he looked around,
0:12:4|0:12:13|A small stone was thrown to his feet. It turned out to be thrown down by [Lin Kai] squatting on the second floor, and [Lin Kai] came to the opposite of the man with glasses.
0:12:33|0:12:49|[Lin Kai] sat on a rock, took out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, flicked the lighter, lit one, held it in his mouth, took a deep drag, and then stared blankly ahead. Seeing this, [Laoying] slowly squatted down beside him.
0:12:50|0:13:2|After speaking, [Lin Kai] glanced at the man in glasses, who nodded thoughtfully.
0:13:7|0:13:12|He then got into the car of the man with glasses and stopped in front of a shantytown.
0:13:13|0:13:20|After looking around, he bent down, opened the car door and got out, while the man with glasses was lost in memories.
0:13:29|0:13:37|Wearing a police uniform, [Lin Kai] stood opposite him, with a resolute and determined expression.
0:13:53|0:13:56|The flashback ends, [Lin Kai] has disappeared at the end of the road.
0:13:56|0:14:8|The camera cuts to Cheng Yi leading [Lin Kai] into a narrow corridor, arriving at the entrance of a mahjong room. A man inside notices them and walks over.
0:14:8|0:14:16|Yingjie got up from the card table and walked over to the two of them.
0:14:20|0:14:26|On the other side, Yang Bin and his friends were sitting in the car, chatting and laughing. Suddenly, gunshots were heard not far away.
0:14:26|0:14:31|He immediately opened the door and ran.
0:14:33|0:14:40|Cheng Yi then led [Lin Kai] into a vegetable market.
0:14:42|0:14:48|He pointed at the vendor.
0:14:51|0:14:57|Yang Bin turned into an alley at this moment, saw the police aiming their guns and fired, but was instantly surrounded and shot in the heart.
0:14:58|0:15:4|Cheng Yi led [Lin Kai] towards the depths of the alley, with his subordinates occasionally handing him cigarettes along the way.
0:15:5|0:15:12|On the side, the police officer touched Yang Bin's neck, repeatedly confirming whether he was dead.
0:15:29|0:15:34|Cheng Yi was actually walking around with [Lin Kai] to familiarize with the heads of various major strongholds, announcing his official takeover from Yang Bin.
0:15:36|0:15:44|Soon after, Lin Kai and Laoying arrived at a factory where neatly dressed workers were methodically separating drugs.
0:15:55|0:16:3|The two indulged in revelry in the nightclub.
0:16:8|0:16:15|[Lin Kai] walked away after receiving the cash, then returned to the factory and carefully inspected the packaged goods. He heard [Li Jianguo] calling his name.
0:16:17|0:16:26|Following him, [Lin Kai] walked towards the depths of the factory. As night fell, a car slowly drove by the riverbank.
0:16:42|0:16:45|[Lin Kai] leaned back on the back seat of the car, talking to the man with glasses.
0:16:45|0:16:53|Hearing this, Lin Kai fell into contemplation. Suddenly, the pained face of his comrade and a tombstone with the name Zhang Haitao,
0:16:53|0:16:59|Entering his mind, but soon, these images disappeared.
0:17:7|0:17:13|[Lin Kai] and his men are eating, drinking, and smoking.
0:17:16|0:17:22|It's as if consciousness has detached. After three rounds of drinks, people gradually go crazy, with someone throwing a large amount of RMB into the air.
0:17:22|0:17:32|In the house, a rain of banknotes fell. However, [Lin Kai] sat at the edge of the bed with a lonely expression, looking at the smoke-filled light and the continuously falling Renminbi.
0:17:34|0:17:43|He numbly drank alcohol and smoked one cigarette after another, the surrounding excitement seemed to have nothing to do with him.
0:17:43|0:17:50|For a long time, the drunken people were sleeping in all sorts of positions, some lying on the ground, some slumped in chairs.
0:17:50|0:17:57|The only similarity is that they both have a lot of cash in their hands. [Lin Kai] fell asleep.
0:17:57|0:18:6|However, he was gasping in pain. In his sleep, a young woman curled up with her legs drawn up, leaning against a chair.
0:18:6|0:18:11|After gritting his teeth, Lin Kai injected the drugs into his arm through a syringe.
0:18:11|0:18:20|Suddenly, she began to convulse uncontrollably, her breathing becoming very rapid. Accidentally knocking over the table lamp beside her onto the ground.
0:18:20|0:18:28|At this moment, a young boy hides behind the cabinet, quietly watching the scene in the room, not daring to make a sound.
0:18:29|0:18:38|Seeing the woman suddenly stiffen in her chair, not moving at all, he bit his lip, shuffled his feet, and when he reached her side, he couldn't help but cry.
0:18:40|0:18:45|The woman turned out to be [Qingshui].
0:18:45|0:18:53|[Ma Dongmei] is the mother of the boy. The phone rings urgently.
0:18:53|0:19:1|[Lin Kai] opened his eyes in an instant, and the little boy in the dream disappeared. It turned out to be his childhood.
0:19:2|0:19:14|Next, [Lin Kai] turned and picked up the phone beside him. After listening, [Lin Kai] quickly got up and opened a door slightly.
0:19:14|0:19:28|Seeing [Cheng Yi] standing at the door, looking at him seriously, Lin Kai shouted. [Cheng Yi] did not respond directly.
0:19:28|0:19:36|Instead, driving with [Lin Kai], arrived at a waste paper compactor station. Slowly, the car stopped in front of a large shovel.
0:19:36|0:19:43|The workers saw this and hurried forward. Soon after, [Cheng Yi] and [Lin Kai] got out of the car.
0:19:50|0:19:57|Lin Kai opened the trunk and suddenly froze, inside were bundles of US dollars.
0:19:57|0:20:3|Seeing the workers skillfully carrying away the money, he stood still and quietly observed. 
0:20:3|0:20:8|[Cheng Yi] stood in front of the car, looking at the workers, holding the money towards the depths of the compression station.
0:20:8|0:20:9|At this moment, Lin Kai, Laoying, Li Jianguo, and Qingshui were all standing on the edge of the cliff, looking down at the raging river below.
0:20:9|0:20:18|A person approached the machine, tapped on the screen a few times, and the conveyor belt immediately started. The forklift first put the waste paper on the conveyor belt.
0:20:18|0:20:22|Several workers then threw bundles of US dollars into the pile of paper.
0:20:25|0:20:30|Soon, the two of them disappeared at the end of the machine together with the conveyor belt.
0:20:30|0:20:36|After a while, an enormous block of garbage emerged from the machine's outlet.
0:20:36|0:20:43|[Lin Kai] took a step forward, staring at everything intently, then turned his head and smiled at [Cheng Yi].
0:20:43|0:20:52|At this moment, the machine was still running steadily, while the forklift quietly transported the compressed garbage blocks.
0:20:52|0:21:4|Suddenly, [Cheng Yi]'s phone rang. He glanced down at it, then turned and walked towards the narrow and dimly lit passage behind. With no one around, he answered.
0:21:6|0:21:14|Hanging up the phone, [Lin Kai] looked around cautiously, then sent out the words "good weather" via text message.
0:21:14|0:21:20|Then quickly walked out of the corridor.
0:21:21|0:21:31|After giving instructions to the workers, [Cheng Yi] waved to [Lin Kai]. Then, he led two trucks away from the waste paper compactor station.
0:21:31|0:21:38|In the car, [Cheng Yi] looked at [Lin Kai] with a tense expression, smiled, and then asked him.
0:21:50|0:21:56|[Cheng Yi] let out a sigh after listening, then turned his head to look at [Lin Kai], smiling with satisfaction.
0:21:56|0:22:13|At this moment, the convoy arrived at the railway transportation transfer station. Among the densely packed goods piles, [Cheng Yi] found a vacant space and slowly parked the car there. The two large trucks behind them stopped not far away.
0:22:13|0:22:18|Cheng Yi finished speaking to [Lin Kai] who followed him, and then walked towards the small building inside the transfer station.
0:22:19|0:22:27|[Lin Kai] then lowered his head and lit a cigarette, standing in place to survey the area. At this moment, Cheng Yi arrived at the warehouse door and peered inside.
0:22:27|0:22:36|Not long after, there was a noise behind them. Two cars and a truck drove through the containers towards the two of them.
0:22:36|0:22:42|The police are ambushing from a vantage point, which is shocking.
0:22:43|0:22:50|In a boxcar at the transfer station, the leader from earlier was deploying the operation with a walkie-talkie.
0:22:52|0:23:0|Looking at the real-time monitoring on the screen, the leader saw the three cars pass by Cheng Yi and [Lin Kai], and parked directly in front of the warehouse.
0:23:0|0:23:9|Soon after, the leading car, a man wearing a headscarf and a gloomy expression, opened the door and got out first.
0:23:9|0:23:18|Cheng Yi, upon seeing the situation, hurried forward, bent at the waist, and warmly greeted him.
0:23:19|0:23:26|Upon seeing General Luo getting out of the car, [Lin Kai] furrowed his brow and stared at him intently.
0:23:26|0:23:36|Cheng Yi quickly put on a smile and explained to him.
0:23:52|0:24:1|After Mr. Luo finished listening, he nodded to one of his subordinates, indicating something. Then, [Lin Kai] led the subordinates to the side of the large truck.
0:24:1|0:24:8|Then a person used a cutting machine to cut off a corner of the garbage block, revealing a bundle of US dollars.
0:24:8|0:24:16|Not far away, the police camera captured the entire process of the transaction between the two parties and the stolen money clearly.
0:24:17|0:24:26|Hearing that there are 28 packs of US dollars, [Luo Zong] signaled to his subordinates again. Subsequently, his group of subordinates uncovered the plastic sheet on the big truck.
0:24:29|0:24:37|At this moment, several huge logs appeared in the carriage, and a henchman used an electric saw to cut a rectangular opening from above.
0:24:37|0:24:43|After moving away the cut wooden blocks, neatly packaged drugs were unexpectedly arranged inside.
0:24:44|0:24:53|At this moment, his subordinate took out a package and threw it to [Lin Kai] standing by the car. After looking at it in his hand, [Lin Kai] immediately walked towards Cheng Yi.
0:24:53|0:24:56|Then, he was handed over.
0:24:58|0:25:6|Cheng Yi joyfully reached out his right hand, and the leader at this moment picked up the walkie-talkie.
0:25:7|0:25:15|In the boxcar, the police officers leaped up and rushed out. The sirens blared, and their subordinates were scared and fled in all directions.
0:25:15|0:25:23|Mr. Luo quickly got into the car under the cover of his subordinates. Taking advantage of the fight between [Lin Kai] and his subordinates, Mr. Luo and Cheng Yi hurriedly escaped.
0:25:23|0:25:26|At this moment, the police stopped the large truck.
0:25:27|0:25:32|As soon as [Lin Kai] drove out of the exit, he found himself surrounded by police cars in the front and back.
0:25:33|0:25:42|On the other side, Cheng Yi, upon seeing the police approaching in the opposite direction, suddenly turned the steering wheel and abandoned the car, then disappeared into the container group.
0:25:42|0:25:51|The police immediately opened fire and chased after them. [Lin Kai] was wrestling with his subordinates, and when he saw the police, he immediately dove under the police car.
0:26:35|0:26:44|After knocking down one of the police officers, he immediately dodged. Unexpectedly, just as he passed through an intersection, he ran into four police officers head-on.
0:26:44|0:26:52|Reluctantly, he could only turn around and hide in the crevice. Then he took out the hand grenade he carried with him and threw it under the police's feet.
0:26:52|0:27:3|The deafening explosion and dazzling fire immediately caught the attention of [Lin Kai]. However, during the chaos, Luo was hit in the right calf while trying to escape.
0:27:3|0:27:12|Shortly after, he threw another grenade at the police. At this moment, [Lin Kai] followed the explosion's light and hurriedly approached Luo Zong, saying.
0:27:14|0:27:18|After identifying the newcomer, [Luo Zong] put away the gun and immediately got into the back seat of the car.
0:27:18|0:27:26|Shortly after, [Lin Kai] accelerated out of the pile of goods, unfortunately, the police car behind was still in hot pursuit.
0:27:26|0:27:31|At this moment, another police car turned into the intersection ahead.
0:27:31|0:27:36|Seeing that he was about to be surrounded, [Lin Kai] suddenly turned the steering wheel and drove into the warehouse.
0:27:36|0:27:43|In the chaos, the vehicles knocked down the goods along the way, while the police kept shooting from behind.
0:27:46|0:27:53|Soon, [Lin Kai] drove the vehicle crashing through the gate, and after landing on the railway, he wobbled forward and drove away.
0:27:53|0:28:1|The leader, who appeared out of nowhere, was wearing a police cap at this moment, looking in the direction where [Lin Kai] was running away, and let out a deep sigh.
0:28:1|0:28:8|In the car, Luo Zong pointed a gun at the back of Lin Kai's head while treating the wound.
0:28:10|0:28:16|[Lin Kai] disdainfully glared at Manager Luo. Manager Luo ignored him.
0:28:17|0:28:25|Taking off the scarf around his neck, [Lin Kai] tightly wrapped it around his calf. After pausing for a moment, he then took out his phone from his pocket and made a call.
0:28:27|0:28:35|Upon answering the call, Lin Kai shouted at the other party to come pick him up by the river after the accident. Soon, they arrived at the riverside.
0:28:35|0:28:42|[Lin Kai] followed the instructions and stopped the car. As he got out of the car and stood still, he turned around and saw,
0:28:42|0:28:52|Luo Zong leaned against the door, still pointing the gun at himself. Staring at the loaded gun, [Lin Kai] felt helpless and could only comply.
0:28:52|0:29:1|Lin Kai slowly walked towards the riverbank. Mr. Luo, seeing this, limped behind him with a gun in hand.
0:29:1|0:29:3|Maintaining a distance of three steps from him.
0:29:3|0:29:13|At this moment, the sky is already bright. In the murky river water, Luo Zong is holding [Lin Kai] hostage, making him carry him on his back and swim to the other side.
0:29:14|0:29:24|He held a gun in one hand and tightly wrapped his other arm around [Lin Kai]'s neck, putting all his weight on top of him. Finally, the two of them swam to the shore.
0:29:24|0:29:27|Mr. Luo groaned in pain because of the wound.
0:29:27|0:29:34|Threatened, [Lin Kai] supported him and walked into the dense jungle on the side. Then, both of them collapsed to the ground.
0:29:35|0:29:43|During a moment of catching his breath, a rustling sound could be heard. As [Lin Kai] just opened his eyes, he saw a person approaching him with a gun.
0:29:43|0:29:46|Before he could even get up, he was knocked unconscious.
0:29:46|0:29:53|Soon after, a group of people arrived at the notorious Golden Triangle region.
0:29:53|0:29:57|[Lin Kai] was blindfolded, hands and feet tied, and thrown into the back seat of a vehicle.
0:29:57|0:30:7|In the front row, a woman wearing sunglasses occasionally looked back at him, then picked up a walkie-talkie and made a call.
0:30:14|0:30:23|After a brief response from Sunglasses Woman's father, he hung up the phone. The camera then pulled back to reveal that he was actually sitting in a room that looked like a prison.
0:30:24|0:30:27|On the exquisite mahogany table, neatly arranged tea sets are placed.
0:30:27|0:30:35|He picked up a bowl of hot water and drank it all in one gulp. At this moment, the group led by the woman in sunglasses arrived at the lumber mill deep in the forest.
0:30:35|0:30:44|[Lin Kai] was blindfolded and thrown to the ground. Soon, two cars slowly drove up the narrow path from deep within the forest.
0:30:47|0:30:53|Shortly after, the car stopped in front of the gate of the lumber factory. Seeing this, the subordinates all stood up straight to welcome them.
0:30:53|0:31:1|Mr. Luo sat on a wooden stake, smoking a cigarette and wiping his gun. At this moment, his fully armed henchmen respectfully opened the car door.
0:31:1|0:31:10|A middle-aged man wearing a straw hat got off the car, waving a handkerchief. The woman in sunglasses stood up straight and walked towards him.
0:31:10|0:31:16|It turns out that he is the father of the woman in sunglasses. Without paying attention to [Li Jianguo] who approached.
0:31:16|0:31:24|He walked towards Lin Kai while playing with the matches in his hand, and then sat directly on the chair opposite Lin Kai.
0:31:24|0:31:30|Two henchmen stood obediently behind him.
0:31:48|0:31:55|The father of [Mo Jing Woman] reached back and took the gun.
0:32:9|0:32:16|The father of the woman in sunglasses aimed a gun at [Lin Kai], seemingly contemplating something. Then, he slowly stood up.
0:32:16|0:32:22|Two subordinates immediately grabbed [Lin Kai] and pushed him in front of the scene.
0:32:27|0:32:33|As soon as the words fell, the father of the woman in sunglasses emptied the bullets in the gun, leaving only one.
0:32:41|0:32:48|The trigger was pulled, but nothing happened the next second. Watching [Lin Kai] curl up into a ball,
0:32:48|0:32:56|The father of [Mo Jing] raised his eyebrows and honked several times in a row.
0:32:57|0:33:3|The father of the woman in sunglasses asked with a smile. [Lin Kai] gritted his teeth in response.
0:33:7|0:33:16|Shortly after, the father of the woman in sunglasses signaled to the henchmen holding [Lin Kai]'s hand. [Lin Kai] was dragged down directly. Seeing this, Mr. Luo...
0:33:16|0:33:23|Throwing away the cigarette in his mouth, dragging his injured leg, Lin Kai limped towards the father of the woman in sunglasses.
0:33:36|0:33:41|The woman in sunglasses, also known as [Qingshui],
0:33:41|0:33:50|After listening, Lin Kai nodded and glanced cautiously at Luo Dongfang. Seeing this, Qingshui's father vigorously wiped Luo Dongfang's neck with a handkerchief.
0:33:50|0:33:55|Shortly after, [Lin Kai] turned and left. Before the sun set,
0:33:55|0:34:1|[Lin Kai] was forced into a car by [Qingshui] and Luo Dongfang, and immediately drove towards the Chinese border.
0:34:1|0:34:8|On a refreshing morning in Yunlai City, a large number of police and journalists gathered inside the factory.
0:34:27|0:34:33|The leader who has a secret deal with Cheng Yi is now standing in front of the public, speaking with righteousness.
0:34:33|0:34:42|Subordinates lit torches in front of the reporters to destroy the drugs. Looking at the leader on the stage, [Lin Kai].
0:34:42|0:34:50|The man in glasses whispered instructions to his colleague. At this moment, [Lin Kai] and the other two arrived at the entrance of a vegetable market by car.
0:35:0|0:35:6|Later, looking at the expressions of [Qingshui] and [Lin Dongfang], he proposed this plan.
0:35:8|0:35:18|Sitting in the back seat, [Luo Dongfang] listened and then leaned forward to threaten him. However, [Lin Kai] ignored him and got out of the car, walking straight into the market.
0:35:18|0:35:35|At this moment, the man wearing a hat was trading with a vegetable vendor, exchanging drugs for money. After receiving the drug funds, he took out a notebook he carried with him and started jotting something down. Just as he put the notebook back into his bag, he turned around and saw [Lin Kai].
0:35:36|0:35:44|[Lin Kai] ignored it and took the notebook. Then, he tore out a page.
0:36:11|0:36:17|[Lin Kai] just slipped a note into Xiaobei's shirt pocket and secretly took his phone.
0:36:17|0:36:26|At this moment in the police station, Lin Kai's phone rang. He abruptly pulled open a drawer, revealing the least used emergency phone.
0:36:33|0:36:38|[Lin Kai] didn't wait for the phone to be answered, he pushed Xiaobei to the ground and returned the phone in one swift motion.
0:36:55|0:37:0|On the narrow road, [Cheng Yi] driving a luxury car, suddenly received a phone call.
0:37:0|0:37:7|Hearing the continuous ringing, he lowered his head to pick up the phone from his seat, took a glance at it, and answered the call.
0:37:11|0:37:16|As soon as the words fell, the rear of Lin Kai's car was violently hit by Laoying.
0:37:16|0:37:24|Next, Laoying's henchman with a gun arrived at Lin Kai's car and forcefully pulled him out of the driver's seat.
0:37:25|0:37:34|[Luo Dongfang] took his phone from the seat. Seeing [Cheng Yi] pinned in the back seat of his car, [Lin Kai] stepped on the gas pedal and accelerated out.
0:37:35|0:37:42|Listening to the frightened gasps of [Cheng Yi], [Luo Dongfang] sitting beside him spoke.
0:38:9|0:38:17|Qingshui listened and then dialed Wang Bo's number, and then handed the phone to Cheng Yi.
0:38:24|0:38:27|[Cheng Yi], with a gun pointed at his forehead, could only comply.
0:38:27|0:38:36|The scene cuts to an abandoned building. [Cheng Yi] and [Wang Bo] are hanging, with broken glass beneath their feet.
0:39:34|0:39:42|[Luo Dongfang] suddenly raised his hand and shot towards [Cheng Yi]'s thigh. Then, he walked up to [Wang Bo] with a phone in hand and pressed the play button.
0:39:56|0:40:2|Upon finishing speaking, [Lin Kai] slowly raised the muzzle of the gun, aiming at the side of [Wang Bo]'s face.
0:40:12|0:40:23|[Luo Dongfang] retracted the gun, turned around, and looked at [Cheng Yi] who was coughing. [Cheng Yi] answered cautiously.
0:40:24|0:40:29|Lin Kai continued to fire, and Laoying fell silent in an instant.
0:40:29|0:40:38|At this moment, one of Luo Dongfang's henchmen quietly approached [Lin Kai] from behind. Wang Bo had just let out a sigh of relief.
0:40:38|0:40:46|Just saw Luo Dongfang speaking towards [Lin Kai]. His henchman immediately raised his gun and approached to confront [Lin Kai].
0:40:47|0:40:52|Who knew, [Lin Kai] dodged and used his body to block Luo Dongfang's shots.
0:40:52|0:40:57|After that, they quickly took care of the others with a few moves and hid behind a cement pillar.
0:40:57|0:41:3|At this moment, Luo Dongfang, who was hiding behind a cement pillar, signaled to [Qingshui] with his eyes.
0:41:3|0:41:9|Lin Kai was asked to step forward while Qingshui took a shot from the other side.
0:41:9|0:41:15|In coordination with the fight, the two walked out from behind the pillar, one in front and one behind, striding towards [Lin Kai].
0:41:16|0:41:24|Seeing Luo Dongfang getting closer to the cement pillar where [Lin Kai] was hiding, suddenly, [Lin Kai] noticed several gas tanks on the open space diagonally ahead.
0:41:25|0:41:34|After several shots, multiple leaking gas tanks spun and flew towards the corner where [Lin Kai] was standing. Seeing this, he crouched down and fired again.
0:41:34|0:41:37|The explosion's shockwave sent Lin Kai flying out directly.
0:41:37|0:41:43|Lin Kai continued to pursue, shooting him in the shoulder while he was unable to get up in time.
0:41:43|0:41:48|Shortly after, [Laoying] approached [Qingshui] from behind and disarmed her of her pistol.
0:41:51|0:41:59|[Luo Dongfang] lay on the ground, clutching his wound. [Lin Kai] threatened [Qingshui] with a gun.
0:42:0|0:42:5|[Lin Kai] did not answer, but just pushed the muzzle forward with force.
0:42:5|0:42:15|Qingshui had no choice but to take out his phone, dial the number, and hand it to Lin Kai behind him. Qingshui's father's voice came through the phone.
0:42:32|0:42:41|He then calmly agreed to Lin Kai's conditions and hung up the phone first. Inside the building,
0:42:41|0:42:50|[Luo Dongfang] covered his injured shoulder, sweating profusely. Then, under the coercion of [Lin Kai], the three of them left the place. The scene shifted,
0:42:50|0:42:55|A man is eating instant noodles in the dormitory.
0:42:58|0:43:2|After the man with glasses and a few police officers stripped him naked, they carefully searched his personal belongings.
0:43:24|0:43:35|After taking the note, Lin Kai found only a scribbled "wait" on it, so he nodded knowingly. On the other side,
0:43:39|0:43:46|He held a gun against Lin Dongfang's head, forcing him to drive obediently, while observing the surroundings.
0:43:46|0:43:53|Upon entering a dense forest, Lin Kai suddenly realized that his phone had completely lost signal, so he looked out the window.
0:43:53|0:44:2|It turns out that there are many signal jammers covered with leaves not far away. At this moment, [Qingshui]'s father waved a handkerchief and walked into the lumber factory.
0:44:2|0:44:11|There are many henchmen holding guns behind. [Lin Kai] is pointing a gun at [Laoying], looking at him quietly.
0:44:12|0:44:19|[Qingshui]'s father stood opposite [Lin Kai], casually waving the handkerchief in his hand, gently creating a breeze.
0:44:27|0:44:33|Qingshui's father lowered his head and smiled.
0:44:42|0:44:47|[Lin Kai] held a gun against [Laoying] as a threat, then smiled and looked towards [Qingshui]'s father.
0:44:47|0:44:53|[Luo Dongfang] hung his head in guilt.
0:45:6|0:45:13|Qingshui's father listened, one hand supporting the chair, the other using a handkerchief to cover his nose and sniffed, then said.
0:45:42|0:45:53|At this moment, [Lin Kai] suddenly smirked, turned the gun around, pointed it at [Qingshui]'s father, then, with a loosened grip of his right hand, handed the gun over.
0:45:53|0:46:2|After [Qingshui]'s father took the gun, he aimed straight at Lin Dongfang's forehead and then walked over to [Qingshui].
0:46:8|0:46:15|After explaining with tears in his eyes, he turned around and returned to [Lin Kai], then slapped him hard, knocking him to the ground.
0:46:15|0:46:23|The scene shifts to the hospital. Lin Kai, accompanied by a few henchmen, walks through the corridor and enters Wang Bo's hospital room.
0:46:26|0:46:31|Then he showed his police officer badge to him. It turned out that his name was [Li Jianguo].
0:46:34|0:46:41|On the other side, [Qingshui]'s father, accompanied by two henchmen, arrived at the second floor of the lumber factory, then walked up to [Lin Kai].
0:46:42|0:46:51|At this moment, [Lin Kai] was tied to a chair, his limbs bound, his head hanging low, his skin torn and bleeding. Then, [Qingshui]'s father raised his hand to signal.
0:46:51|0:47:3|Lin Kai was immediately doused with a bucket of water by his henchmen. The extra stimulation woke him up immediately, and he lifted his head, swaying weakly.
0:47:4|0:47:13|Qingshui's father sat across and asked. Water kept flowing down Lin Kai's injured cheek.
0:47:13|0:47:16|But he only spat out a mouthful of water without saying a word.
0:47:17|0:47:23|Shortly after, [Qingshui]'s father gestured again, and one of his men immediately brought a piece of cloth to cover [Lin Kai]'s face.
0:47:23|0:47:27|Another person poured the wine into his mouth and nose.
0:47:27|0:47:34|After the blanket was removed, [Lin Kai] kept vomiting alcohol outward.
0:47:34|0:47:42|Qingshui's father leaned forward, fanned himself with a handkerchief, and then spoke again.
0:48:18|0:48:26|Qingshui's father gritted his teeth and finished speaking, then turned and walked away. His men then swarmed in, once again covering Lin Kai with a cloth and pouring alcohol over him.
0:48:26|0:48:34|[Lin Kai] kept struggling, but his hands and feet were firmly held down. [Qingshui] looked on with pity.
0:48:35|0:48:44|At this moment, [Qingshui]'s father knelt in front of the Buddha hall. Looking at the portrait of the woman in the Buddha hall, he said contentedly.
0:48:45|0:48:50|The scene shifts to a wooden house by the river. [Lin Kai] is lying unconscious on the floor.
0:48:51|0:49:0|In a haze, he seemed to see an old man walking towards him. The person squatted down next to Lin Kai, holding a tray, and placed things on the ground.
0:49:0|0:49:11|Lift up [Lin Kai]'s arm, tie on the rubber tube. Tap lightly a few times, find the vein, then pull out the syringe and inject the medicine into his arm.
0:49:12|0:49:17|The scene before him became chaotic, and [Lin Kai] was lost in memories.
0:49:30|0:49:36|Training scenes as a police officer.
0:49:38|0:49:44|Multiple images intertwined constantly, [Lin Kai] passed out in pain. When he woke up again, it was already night.
0:49:44|0:49:49|Inside the room, the fan continued to sway from side to side. [Lin Kai] lay quietly on the ground.
0:49:50|0:49:55|A little girl first helps him remove the gauze on his arm and clean the wound.
0:49:55|0:49:59|Then, his arm was rebandaged with new gauze.
0:50:0|0:50:7|After the old man propped him up, the girl held a bowl and slowly fed [Lin Kai]. Meanwhile,
0:50:7|0:50:18|[Qingshui]'s father is sitting in a room that has been renovated to look like a prison cell, smoking a cigarette. Next to a warm table lamp, a prominent photo of him kissing a beautiful woman when he was young.
0:50:19|0:50:27|Upon closer inspection, the latter is the woman in the Buddha hall he referred to as Yunan.
0:50:27|0:50:39|On the other side, seeing [Lin Kai] passing out again, the old man tied his arms with a rubber tube and then scooped a spoonful of powdered substance from a large jar to mix into the medicine.
0:50:39|0:50:44|Continuing, he withdrew the syringe and slowly pushed it into his arm.
0:50:44|0:50:50|[Lin Kai] seemed to realize something, he furrowed his brow and slowly opened his eyes.
0:50:51|0:50:59|But he just mechanically blinked his eyes, with a dull and vacant look, then he tilted his head and fell into a deep sleep.
0:51:0|0:51:6|Daylight broke in the blink of an eye.
0:51:19|0:51:26|Seeing that [Lin Kai] had regained consciousness and the car parked on the other side of the river, the old man helped him onto the boat and sat him down.
0:51:26|0:51:31|Taking him to the other side, [Lin Kai] observed the surroundings from left to right.
0:51:31|0:51:36|But soon, he was grabbed by two men on the shoulders and pulled off the boat.
0:51:36|0:51:45|Qingshui, who was originally sitting in the car, saw Lin Kai approaching, immediately opened the door and got out of the car, circled behind him, and blindfolded his eyes with a cloth.
0:51:46|0:51:54|After leaving the riverbank, the car arrived at a bustling market, passing through the crowded crowd and continuing to drive forward.
0:51:56|0:52:1|Informants planted by [Qingshui]'s father are stationed all over the market, silently watching the movement of this car.
0:52:2|0:52:10|Blindfolded Lin Kai can only rely on his hearing to sense the surrounding noise, while Qingshui sits next to him expressionless.
0:52:10|0:52:16|The car then arrived at the outskirts and slowly turned into a school. Inside the empty classroom,
0:52:16|0:52:20|[Qingshui]'s father is loudly asking the children who wants to play with him.
0:52:38|0:52:47|As [Qingshui] led [Lin Kai] in, the children cheered and surrounded [Qingshui]. [Qingshui]'s father sat nonchalantly in a chair.
0:52:47|0:52:54|Swinging his handkerchief back and forth, [Laoying] watched everything intently. Then, the three of them walked into the school cafeteria together.
0:52:54|0:53:4|The children immediately stopped their cleaning work when they saw the leader [Qingshui], and approached her. [Qingshui]'s father then boastfully said to [Lin Kai].
0:53:4|0:53:14|Lin Kai gestured for Li Jianguo to sit across from him.
0:53:42|0:53:46|[Lin Kai] suddenly yawned heavily.
0:53:46|0:53:50|Qingshui's father took a deep breath with a handkerchief.
0:53:58|0:54:4|Qingshui's father listened with great interest and looked at him.
0:54:4|0:54:11|And [Lin Kai] couldn't help but yawn at this moment.
0:54:26|0:54:34|At this moment, [Lin Kai] uncomfortably moved his shoulder. Seeing this, [Qingshui]'s father reached out his right hand to him, and as soon as they shook hands,
0:54:34|0:54:41|He forcefully pulled [Lin Kai] towards himself. Then, he gazed into his eyes and said lightly.
0:54:46|0:54:51|[Lin Kai] listened, his eyes widening in shock, his breathing becoming more rapid.
0:54:52|0:54:58|Later, he remembered the scene where the old man injected himself with a syringe in the wooden house by the river.
0:55:6|0:55:15|[Lin Kai] looked at the object in his hand, his whole face starting to tremble uncontrollably. Meanwhile, [Qingshui]'s father nonchalantly turned and walked away.
0:55:16|0:55:24|In order to stop his desire to take drugs, [Lin Kai] frantically hit his own head, accidentally flinging the drugs away.
0:55:24|0:55:29|He then tightly gripped the table with both hands, trying hard to control himself.
0:55:29|0:55:36|But the next second, he was like an unconscious puppet, standing up and searching for the drugs he had thrown out.
0:55:36|0:55:45|In a flurry of movement, the chairs in the canteen and the tableware on the table were left in disarray by him. It was late at night,
0:55:45|0:55:48|The dormitory was quiet, and the children were all sleeping soundly.
0:55:48|0:55:53|In the next room, [Lin Kai] is holding a piece of paper, sitting at the table and drawing something.
0:55:53|0:55:57|Drawing while sniffing, forcing himself to sink into thought.
0:55:59|0:56:12|On the way to school, Lin Kai kept tapping and counting with his hands and feet, and based on this, he drew a map on paper. However, the drug addiction made him breathe rapidly, and even the muscles on his face twitched.
0:56:12|0:56:17|Therefore, he could only cover his head with his hands, forcing himself to concentrate.
0:56:17|0:56:25|At this moment, the paper in front of them became increasingly blurred, as if the words and patterns were walking down from above.
0:56:25|0:56:32|[Lin Kai] clenched his fists tightly, trying hard to keep himself calm, but he couldn't hold back.
0:56:32|0:56:39|On the bedside table, the package of drugs given by [Qingshui]'s father seemed to be magnified, allowing him to lock onto it accurately with just a turn of his head.
0:56:40|0:56:45|But he forced himself to turn back, trembling as he took out two cigarettes and put them in his mouth.
0:56:45|0:56:52|Just after taking a few puffs, he looked back at the small packet of drugs, and finally, he turned around and clenched the stuff in his hand.
0:56:53|0:57:0|Staring at his fist for a moment, he then tapped his head again, and finally, he threw the drugs on the ground with a flick of his hand.
0:57:1|0:57:8|Then, he suddenly stood up, picked up the water pitcher and poured water into the cup. After finishing it in one gulp, he paced anxiously in the room.
0:57:10|0:57:19|At this moment, he saw a bundle of hemp rope, so he immediately used it to tie his hands and secure them to the head of the bed.
0:57:19|0:57:26|In a daze, he curled up in bed and saw, not far away on the wall, a stick figure drawn in chalk walking down.
0:57:28|0:57:40|Then floating in the air, it suddenly transformed into the appearance of [Qingshui]'s father. [Lin Kai] was startled and shivered, then saw him waving a handkerchief and walking towards him.
0:57:49|0:57:58|Turning his head, [Lin Kai] saw [Li Jianguo] again, and then his mother appeared. Seeing his mother, he couldn't help but burst into tears.
0:57:58|0:58:5|And the mother then smiled, slowly approached, and sat down beside him.
0:58:15|0:58:23|Looking at the suffering Lin Kai, his mother gently pats his back, then slowly nestles her head into his neck.
0:58:23|0:58:31|[Lin Kai] cried like a child.
0:58:31|0:58:40|But all of this is just a fantasy of Lin Kai's, the person holding him is not his mother, but Qingshui.
0:58:41|0:58:46|Seeing [Lin Kai] release himself, [Qingshui] unscrewed the medicine bottle and dripped a few drops of medicine by his lips.
0:58:46|0:58:57|Continuing, she gently wiped his forehead with a towel. Soon, [Lin Kai] stopped struggling and held onto her arms.
0:58:58|0:59:1|Upon seeing this, [Qingshui] wiped away the tears of pain from [Lin Kai]'s eyes.
0:59:2|0:59:11|It was as if she really thought of herself as his mother, gently caressing and patting him. Finally, [Lin Kai] fell into a deep sleep.
0:59:11|0:59:15|And [Qingshui] sat by his side, accompanying him through the whole night.
0:59:15|0:59:20|The next day, [Lin Kai] woke up covered in sweat.
0:59:20|0:59:30|He blinked in confusion, turned his head, and found the hemp rope used to tie himself up last night lying next to the pillow. Then he looked towards the head of the bed.
0:59:30|0:59:39|After discovering that the drugs were still there, he sighed. At the desk, [Qingshui] was tidying up the brushes on the table.
0:59:39|0:59:48|[Lin Kai] then slowly approached her, asking in confusion. [Qingshui] stopped what she was doing, without answering the question.
0:59:48|0:59:56|Instead, she stood up and walked past him towards the stairs. [Lin Kai] kept his eyes fixed on her, then turned to look at her back.
0:59:57|1:0:5|After walking a distance, [Qingshui] suddenly stopped in his tracks, then took out a crumpled piece of paper from his pants pocket.
1:0:5|1:0:12|Turning around, [Laoying] walked up to Lin Kai, holding up a crumpled piece of paper.
1:0:13|1:0:20|After handing it to [Lin Kai], he left without looking back. Watching [Qingshui] walking away,
1:0:20|1:0:25|[Lin Kai] opens the paper ball and is surprised to find that it is the map he drew himself.
1:0:25|1:0:31|At noon, two cars drove through the winding forest road.
1:0:31|1:0:38|[Lin Kai] sat in the back seat of the second car, with [Qingshui] sitting next to him, looking out the window expressionlessly.
1:0:38|1:0:43|At this moment, [Lin Kai] noticed that the GPS on the car kept showing malfunction.
1:0:43|1:0:48|The convoy drove for a long time and finally entered a hidden factory.
1:0:48|1:0:52|[Lin Kai] looked out through the window calmly without making a sound.
1:0:52|1:0:59|At this moment, on the first floor of the factory, the workers are processing the raw materials for making drugs in an orderly manner.
1:1:0|1:1:7|[Qingshui] led [Lin Kai] through the crowd to the second floor. After pulling back the door curtain, [Lin Kai] was instantly stunned.
1:1:8|1:1:17|In front of them appeared a three-story high greenhouse cultivation frame, growing on the frame was the raw material of drugs, poppy flowers.
1:1:17|1:1:24|Next to the flowers are not only a humidifier and a detector, but also guards with guns patrolling the aisle.
1:1:33|1:1:40|[Qingshui]'s father walked up to [Lin Kai] and showed off. [Lin Kai] leaned on the railing and responded.
1:1:52|1:2:0|The two then exchanged a smile, but soon after, [Qingshui]'s father looked back at the training frame, and the smile on his face disappeared in an instant.
1:2:0|1:2:7|The scene shifts back to Yunlai City, where [Lin Kai] is driving a car, with [Qingshui] sitting beside him. In the background,
1:2:7|1:2:15|Qingshui's younger brother drove the second car closely following. Suddenly, Lin Kai noticed from the rearview mirror.
1:2:15|1:2:23|[Qingshui] looked back and saw a small car attempting to overtake his younger brother's car. He then took out a cigarette and put it in his mouth.
1:2:23|1:2:31|Continuing, he took out a lighter and lit it. [Qingshui] in the passenger seat next to him, impatiently rolled down the window.
1:2:32|1:2:42|[Lin Kai] noticed behind him and also closed the window on his side. Then, he casually rested the hand holding the cigarette on the car door outside.
1:2:44|1:3:0|It turned out that in the car was [Li Jianguo], who took off his glasses, took out binoculars to observe carefully, and then discovered that [Lin Kai] was hiding and systematically tapping the car body. [Li Jianguo] immediately instructed his colleagues.
1:3:2|1:3:7|Then he casually glanced back. At this moment, the car accelerated and brushed past [Lin Kai].
1:3:7|1:3:18|[Li Jianguo] inadvertently lowered the car window as he paralleled with him. In the warehouse, a truck filled with logs slowly started up and drove forward.
1:3:18|1:3:26|In the hotel, [Wang Bo] curled up on the bed, his hands handcuffed. Soon after, plainclothes police officers woke him up.
1:3:26|1:3:34|After unlocking the handcuffs, he led him out of the room. On the other side, [Lin Kai] took [Qingshui] to a dilapidated building.
1:3:34|1:3:40|Through the winding and narrow corridor, finally came across [Wang Bo] holding a file bag.
1:3:41|1:3:49|At the border crossing, [Lin Kai] and [Qingshui] were stopped with a large truck loaded with logs.
1:3:50|1:3:58|But when the armed police saw the permit, they immediately stamped it and let it pass. Afterwards, the convoy arrived at a wood processing factory.
1:3:58|1:4:4|Workers are continuously extracting drugs with the Double Eagle logo from the logs.
1:4:5|1:4:10|On the other side, [Qingshui] was watching as the workers loaded bundles of US dollars onto the truck.
1:4:10|1:4:16|Then, he opened the box next to him and counted the number of gold bars inside.
1:4:17|1:4:25|A few days later, [Lin Kai] once again brought the convoy to Yunlai City. This time, he made an appointment with Xiaobei, just like last time.
1:4:25|1:4:29|First, use a truck to transport drugs, then bring back cash to the Golden Triangle.
1:4:30|1:4:35|After exchanging the truck keys, [Lin Kai] left with his men first.
1:4:35|1:4:43|Immediately, [Li Jianguo] slowly walked out from deep inside the factory, glanced at Xiaobei, and took out his phone from his pocket.
1:4:44|1:4:53|In the hotel, [Lin Kai] and two others quickly ate instant noodles and went to sleep. In the middle of the night, while he was sleeping soundly, he suddenly broke out in a cold sweat.
1:4:53|1:4:57|The face twitched unnaturally. Obviously, [Lin Kai] was in pain.
1:4:57|1:4:58|This is a relapse of drug addiction.
1:4:59|1:5:5|So, with rapid breaths, he slowly woke up from deep sleep. Just as he opened his groggy eyes,
1:5:5|1:5:15|I saw smoke billowing in from under the hotel door crack. Before I could react, I fell asleep again.
1:5:15|1:5:21|Suddenly, the door was gently pushed open, and then two people found [Lin Kai] and carried him out.
1:5:21|1:5:26|In the room, all the people including [Qingshui] were completely unaware of this.
1:5:26|1:5:35|At this moment, [Lin Kai]'s head was pushed into the water tank, the suffocation quickly brought him back to his senses. Then, he suddenly lifted his head.
1:5:35|1:5:44|Surprised to hear words of concern, [Lin Kai] suddenly turned around, only to find [Li Jianguo] standing beside him.
1:5:45|1:5:55|After that, he took the towel thrown to him and casually wiped his wet hair. Upon hearing this, [Lin Kai] stopped the action of drying his hair.
1:6:8|1:6:12|In a fit of rage, [Lin Kai] slammed the towel hard onto the ground.
1:6:12|1:6:21|Water flowed into his eyes along his wet hairline, but he didn't care at all, glaring fiercely at [Li Jianguo]. Seeing this,
1:6:21|1:6:27|[Li Jianguo] bent down slowly, picked up the towel, and threw it back into [Lin Kai]'s hands.
1:6:29|1:6:39|After speaking, [Lin Kai] ran his hand through his hair, took big strides past [Li Jianguo], and walked to the edge of the rooftop. Then, [Li Jianguo] stepped forward and stood shoulder to shoulder with him.
1:7:14|1:7:16|[Li Jianguo] furrowed his brow, looking extremely shocked.
1:7:16|1:7:23|Sighing, explained to [Lin Kai].
1:7:47|1:7:54|In the woods, the car suddenly overturned, and [Li Jianguo] was thrown out directly.
1:7:57|1:8:3|In the car, his comrade [Zhang Haitao] hadn't climbed out yet when the whole car exploded.
1:8:4|1:8:10|Looking at the grieving and indignant [Li Jianguo], [Lin Kai] took a step forward and asked solemnly.
1:8:16|1:8:30|After pondering for a while, [Li Jianguo] put on his glasses and spoke again.
1:8:40|1:8:50|[Lin Kai] sniffed, responded solemnly, then glanced at [Li Jianguo] before quickly leaving the rooftop. With everything settled, he returned to the Golden Triangle.
1:8:50|1:8:59|[Lin Kai] was sitting outside the solemn temple, smoking one cigarette after another. Then, he was led into the temple by [Qingshui].
1:8:59|1:9:7|At this moment, the monk begins to pray. May the Buddha transform misfortune and eliminate illness.
1:9:17|1:9:25|To obtain longevity, beauty, happiness, and health. At this moment, the monk clasps his hands together and bows deeply to the Buddha statue.
1:9:27|1:9:31|Turning around, [Lin Kai] gestured to everyone that they could now present the flower garland.
1:9:31|1:9:36|The crowd first bowed to the father of [Qingshui] who was standing at the front of the line.
1:9:36|1:9:45|Following that, they gradually left the Buddha hall. [Qingshui], without saying a word, walked to the front of the Buddha statue and gazed at the jade image beside the floral wreath.
1:9:45|1:9:53|She looked deeply, then clasped her hands together, closed her eyes, and bowed sincerely. [Lin Kai] stood curiously behind.
1:9:55|1:10:7|At this moment, [Qingshui]'s father came to his side, looking at the memorial tablet, and slowly spoke. Looking at the photo of Yunan on the tablet, he smiled gently.
1:10:8|1:10:15|Turning around, his eyes fixed on [Lin Kai].
1:10:17|1:10:35|[Qingshui]'s father listened, moved his burned left ear, then turned to look at Yunan again. He curled his lips, smiled inexplicably, and slowly walked towards the outside of the Buddha hall.
1:10:35|1:10:44|[Lin Kai] looked at his back, lost in thought. At night, he followed [Qingshui] to a spiral stone staircase.
1:10:44|1:10:51|Continuing on, slowly walking down. Through the dim light on the wall, [Lin Kai] discovers,
1:10:51|1:11:1|This is an underground base built with rocks. At this moment, [Qingshui] opens a door, and the two enter a place that resembles a dungeon.
1:11:1|1:11:8|Next, [Qingshui] stopped in front of a gun-wielding guard, nodded gently, and another door was pulled open.
1:11:10|1:11:15|Dad [Qingshui], dressed in a suit, is sitting at the head of the long table, drinking red wine.
1:11:15|1:11:22|After [Lin Kai] entered the room, the iron door behind him immediately closed.
1:11:34|1:11:40|Lin Kai looked at the inquisitive gaze of the elders.
1:11:40|1:11:50|After calmly meeting his gaze, he nodded politely. Then, [Qingshui]'s father wiped his mouth with a napkin.
1:11:50|1:11:56|He then got up and walked towards [Lin Kai].
1:12:6|1:12:13|Lin Kai, with his shoulder embraced by Qingshui's father, looked meaningfully at him. And the elders listened,
1:12:13|1:12:19|Laughter erupted in the audience. It turned out that the "Laoying" mentioned by "Li Jianguo" was actually Qingshui's father. At this moment,
1:12:19|1:12:26|He turned around and pulled out a chair for [Lin Kai], letting him sit down, and personally poured a glass of red wine that had already been prepared.
1:12:52|1:13:0|[Laoying] swayed the wine glass, walked to the table, and then took out a small bag of powder to show to the elders.
1:13:34|1:13:43|The elder in a suit unexpectedly refused directly. [Laoying], after swallowing a piece of pizza with interest, leisurely made his way back to his seat.
1:14:14|1:14:20|[Laoying] interrupted him, stood up, and used a fork to put the vegetables into the plate in front of him.
1:14:20|1:14:30|Lin Kai carefully placed the napkin on his lap, lowered his head, and started eating quietly. Soon after, the dinner table fell into a dead silence.
1:14:32|1:14:38|The scene shifts, and the birds lose their direction due to the interference of the solar disruptor. Afterwards, [Lin Kai]...
1:14:38|1:14:44|Lin Kai, dressed in a suit, braved the scorching sun and arrived at a rooftop in the town.
1:14:47|1:14:52|Laoying, seemingly oblivious, picked up the poppies drying in the bamboo basket and sniffed them.
1:14:52|1:14:56|[Lin Kai] followed [Qingshui] through the corridor and arrived at the hallway on the second floor.
1:14:59|1:15:5|Just as he was about to go upstairs, he saw the elder in a suit falling headfirst onto the terrace.
1:15:5|1:15:12|After a burst of intense gunfire, he fell down on the spot. [Qingshui] watched and urged [Lin Kai].
1:15:13|1:15:19|[Laoying] stood at the edge of the rooftop, looking at the body, and wiped his face with a handkerchief. [Qingshui] called out to [Laoying].
1:15:24|1:15:31|[Laoying] turned around and pointed at [Lin Kai]. After speaking, [Laoying] gestured for [Lin Kai] to come forward.
1:15:48|1:15:58|Laoying flicks his handkerchief, gesturing for Lin Kai to come to his side.
1:16:10|1:16:14|After speaking, he paused for a moment and then turned around, his gaze fixed on the distant town.
1:16:23|1:16:31|[Laoying] said firmly. [Laoying] looked up at the sky, then covered his eyes with a handkerchief.
1:16:32|1:16:41|After giving orders to [Lin Kai], [Qingshui] walked straight past him and down the rooftop. [Lin Kai] turned around in confusion, only to see the hurried figure of [Laoying] leaving.
1:16:42|1:16:47|So he had to follow and then arrived at the underground base. 
1:16:47|1:16:59|At this moment, [Laoying] stood in front of a prison cell door. After making the guard leave, he decisively pulled down the small window on the door. The half-naked man inside immediately shrank into the corner upon hearing the noise.
1:17:0|1:17:10|His hair was all gone, covered in burns, [Lin Kai] looked inside unbelievably.
1:17:32|1:17:45|In the memory, [Li Jianguo], [Laoying], and the pregnant Yunan were busy in the drug manufacturing factory. After the explosion, half of the factory wall was blown up, and fully armed police quickly rushed in.
1:17:45|1:17:53|Laoying hurried to support his wife and ran towards the door with the escort of two drug dealers. They were about to get in the car and leave.
1:17:53|1:18:1|The voice of warning from [Li Jianguo] came from behind. The couple was shocked.
1:18:1|1:18:5|Then, Lin Kai and Laoying turned around and stared at him intently.
1:18:6|1:18:11|[Li Jianguo] took out two drug dealers first, then landed a blow on the right shoulder of [Laoying].
1:18:11|1:18:16|Unexpectedly, Yanan immediately counterattacked and hit his left arm.
1:18:16|1:18:25|At this moment, [Li Jianguo] lost his balance and fell backwards, accidentally pulling the trigger, and the bullet instantly pierced through Yunan's chest.
1:18:25|1:18:35|[Laoying] dropped the gun and ran to Yunan's side. With trembling hands, he reached towards her swollen belly, then bowed his head.
1:18:36|1:18:41|Buried into her neck. At this moment, Zhang Haitao quickly pulled [Li Jianguo] up.
1:18:43|1:18:52|Soon after, the two looked ahead together, with [Laoying] kneeling weakly beside Yunan, surrounded by special police officers aiming their guns at him.
1:18:52|1:19:1|He slowly straightened up, turned his head, and stared gloomily at [Li Jianguo]. Everything seemed to have settled.
1:19:4|1:19:11|Two cars drove out of the factory, one in front of the other. In the back seat of the leading car, [Li Jianguo] and Zhang Haitao sat on either side of [Laoying].
1:19:11|1:19:19|Soon after, the convoy turned into a grove of trees, when suddenly, an off-road vehicle caught up from a side road. A drug dealer leaned out and opened fire continuously.
1:19:21|1:19:30|The special police in the rear car quickly counterattacked, with a shot hitting the drug dealer's heart in the driver's cab. At this moment, a second off-road vehicle appeared.
1:19:31|1:19:35|A drug dealer directly used a rocket launcher to blow up the special police vehicle.
1:19:35|1:19:41|Li Jianguo looked back in shock, while Zhang Haitao firmly held onto Laoying's body.
1:19:43|1:19:47|Suddenly, a sharp turn, the vehicle lost balance and rolled out.
1:19:47|1:19:54|[Laoying] looked in horror at the leaking car, while Zhang Haitao was pinned under the seat, also in a daze.
1:19:54|1:20:4|Shortly after, the drug dealers hurriedly got off the car and were the first to carry [Laoying] out from the already burning vehicle.
1:20:6|1:20:14|[Laoying] almost frantically had his men drag out Zhang Haitao. And in the midst of this, the car finally couldn't take it anymore.
1:20:26|1:20:30|The flashback ends, and [Lin Kai] looks back into the cell.
1:20:30|1:20:38|Zhang Haitao was leaning against the slippery wall, shivering.
1:20:52|1:21:2|Then [Laoying] looked steadily at Lin Kai. At this moment, [Laoying] picked up a handkerchief and vigorously wiped his burnt left ear.
1:21:2|1:21:9|In the pitch-black forest, two cars were driving forward one after the other.
1:21:12|1:21:17|Sitting in the passenger seat, with his eyes covered, [Lin Kai] curiously asks [Qingshui] who is driving.
1:21:48|1:21:56|Shortly after, [Qingshui] furrowed his brow, recalling the words spoken by a man.
1:22:6|1:22:11|Next, a tear rolled down [Qingshui]'s eyes, leaving a straight trail.
1:22:11|1:22:18|But the vehicle still drove into the darkness. The scene shifted to a gloomy afternoon,
1:22:18|1:22:24|[Lin Kai] drove to the entrance of a KTV with someone. In an indoor basketball court not far away,
1:22:26|1:22:35|[Li Jianguo] and several plainclothes police officers are watching through the monitor. Then, he sits down on a chair, puts on the listening earphones, and places them near his ear.
1:22:35|1:22:43|At this moment, [Lin Kai] led the group into the KTV. In the spacious place, there was only a cleaning lady tidying up and [Wang Bo].
1:22:43|1:22:53|Taking a deep breath, [Lin Kai] relaxedly leaned back on the fabric sofa next to [Wang Bo].
1:22:53|1:22:58|[Wang Bo] lit a cigarette. [Li Jianguo] was instantly stunned.
1:23:15|1:23:27|[Lin Kai] stood up after listening, put his arm around [Wang Bo]'s shoulder, sat beside him, and said seriously.
1:23:33|1:23:37|Li Jianguo, who was listening in, incredulously pressed down on his headphones.
1:23:46|1:23:53|At this moment, the burning vehicle and Zhang Haitao's concern immediately rushed into [Li Jianguo]'s mind.
1:23:55|1:24:3|Everything made his heart ache. Then, he furrowed his brow and slowly took off the headphones from his head.
1:24:3|1:24:6|The process seemed to have slowed down,
1:24:6|1:24:17|It seems like he could exert all his strength in the next second. Then, he stood up straight, suddenly roared loudly, and fiercely picked up his chair, throwing himself forward.
1:24:18|1:24:24|Colleagues were all looking sideways. The sun rises in the east and sets in the west, and time quickly passes by.
1:24:25|1:24:33|In the gloomy weather, [Lin Kai] drove the car and stopped by the side of the road with [Qingshui], then a sedan slowly approached.
1:24:33|1:24:37|[Wang Bo] opens the back door and approaches [Lin Kai].
1:24:38|1:24:45|Qingshui, sitting in the passenger seat, listened attentively and then lowered his eyes thoughtfully.
1:25:19|1:25:25|[Li Jianguo] stood in the indoor gym, decisively ending the call with the director.
1:25:25|1:25:31|He then took off his glasses, left without looking back, and his footsteps did not hesitate at all.
1:25:32|1:25:41|Soon, he followed [Lin Kai] to a hotel room where he was searched by three drug dealers in a row. After confirming his identity, the two of them walked in.
1:25:42|1:25:50|Upon hearing the sound, [Qingshui], who was originally sitting at the table, immediately stood up and kept his eyes on [Li Jianguo]. Then Wang Bo spoke.
1:26:7|1:26:12|[Li Jianguo] stopped him, while [Qingshui] lowered his head and dialed [Laoying]'s phone number.
1:26:16|1:26:26|Li Jianguo glanced at Qingshui, then took a deep breath, took the phone from her hand, and put it to his ear.
1:26:30|1:26:35|[Laoying] stood in the prison cell, with the barely conscious Zhang Haitao behind him. He answered with joy.
1:26:42|1:26:50|He then turned around, pulled the phone away, and when his subordinate understood, he picked up a stick and swung it towards Zhang Haitao.
1:26:50|1:26:57|The painful groans were transmitted through the receiver to the other end of the phone. [Li Jianguo] couldn't bear to close his eyes.
1:26:57|1:27:6|Shortly after, [Laoying] hung up the phone.
1:27:6|1:27:14|Upon hearing Li Jianguo's request, Laoying suddenly trembled, then remembered his deceased wife and children.
1:27:17|1:27:23|Tears welled up in the eyes as words were exchanged.
1:27:25|1:27:33|Li Jianguo was about to hang up the phone when he heard a voice.
1:27:34|1:27:42|Li Jianguo immediately looked at Lin Kai.
1:27:45|1:28:0|[Qingshui] had just answered the phone when [Li Jianguo] pulled out a handgun from his waist. He then turned around and kicked [Lin Kai] in the chest, quickly fired the gun, causing [Lin Kai] to fall headfirst out of the window from the second floor.
1:28:1|1:28:7|After speaking, [Li Jianguo] stepped over [Qingshui] and walked out of the door first. Wang Bo also followed out.
1:28:7|1:28:13|But he was stopped by a drug dealer pointing a gun at his forehead.
1:28:13|1:28:17|Shortly after, the group quickly got on the car and swiftly left the hotel.
1:28:17|1:28:25|Passing through the intersection, [Qingshui] looked sorrowfully in the direction where [Lin Kai] had fallen until he completely disappeared, then turned his gaze away.
1:28:25|1:28:30|At this moment, the plainclothes police officers quickly arrived. [Lin Kai], who was lying on top of the van, suddenly opened his eyes.
1:28:30|1:28:42|Staring in the direction that [Li Jianguo] left, breathing heavily in frustration. At this moment, [Li Jianguo] sitting in the back seat of the vehicle, had his eyes covered.
1:28:42|1:28:50|The special police officer is using the watch on his wrist to track his location. Then, the vehicle crosses the paddy fields and enters a dense forest.
1:28:52|1:28:59|The car was swaying, with [Qingshui] sitting next to [Li Jianguo], keeping his eyes lowered the whole time.
1:28:59|1:29:10|A ray of sunlight suddenly shone into the car, she looked out the window, and then, remembered the past. [Laoying] pulled the trigger.
1:29:13|1:29:18|Little [Qingshui] hid under the floor, peeking through the cracks, and saw his father being shot by [Laoying] himself.
1:29:18|1:29:25|When [Laoying] left, [Li Jianguo] suddenly noticed through a crack that little [Qingshui] was tightly hugging a doll.
1:29:25|1:29:29|At this moment, [Laoying] is standing devoutly on the rooftop worshipping.
1:29:41|1:29:49|On the other side, on the quiet mountain road, [Lin Kai] is driving a motorcycle speeding past. Meanwhile, [Li Jianguo] is being grabbed by the drug trafficker, pulled off the car.
1:29:49|1:29:56|Later, they walked towards a small building. [Qingshui] stood by the car, looking at his back with a complex expression in his eyes.
1:29:58|1:30:6|On the rooftop, the birds that were originally circling around the jammer flew away, and then [Li Jianguo] had the cloth removed from his eyes and walked over.
1:30:7|1:30:16|Laoying, who was originally worshipping, turned around and, upon seeing him, immediately walked up to him, with his eyes fixed on him.
1:30:16|1:30:29|Li Jianguo kept looking back. At this moment, [Laoying] stopped not far from Li Jianguo.
1:30:29|1:30:41|Then, like an old friend, he smiled and said, [Li Jianguo] interrupted his reminiscing.
1:30:46|1:30:56|Laoying's upturned mouth froze, he glanced at Li Jianguo, then moved his mouth slightly. Next, he raised his left hand and bent his fingers.
1:30:57|1:31:2|Immediately, a drug dealer pressed down on [Zhang Haitao] and walked towards the two of them.
1:31:2|1:31:6|Then, the drug dealer forcefully kicked his knees and ripped off his hat.
1:31:7|1:31:14|The disfigured [Zhang Haitao] looked up and saw [Li Jianguo], instantly covering his face with his hands, but helplessly, his arms were pulled apart by the drug trafficker.
1:31:15|1:31:22|[Li Jianguo] wanted to step forward, but was firmly held back by the drug dealer behind him.
1:31:35|1:31:42|Continuing, he raised his right hand, and the drug dealer behind him immediately handed him a revolver.
1:31:42|1:31:51|Afterward, he unloaded all the bullets from the gun, picked out two, reloaded them into the magazine, and then walked slowly to [Zhang Haitao]'s front, squatting down.
1:32:4|1:32:10|[Zhang Haitao] instantly widened his eyes.
1:32:26|1:32:31|Zhang Haitao listened and his eyes welled up with tears. He looked at [Li Jianguo] helplessly, trembling.
1:32:31|1:32:42|Next, his right hand was forcibly stuffed into the gun by [Laoying]. At this moment, the drug dealer released Zhang Haitao's arms, and he lowered his head to look at the gun in his hand, his right hand trembling uncontrollably.
1:32:43|1:32:55|Laoying was about to burst into laughter, but unexpectedly Zhang Haitao suddenly pressed against his own chin, and Laoying shot Li Jianguo in the left foot.
1:32:57|1:33:12|The drug dealer dragged Zhang Haitao in front of [Li Jianguo], forcing him to point the gun at the other's head, but he refused to shoot. [Laoying] pointed a gun at Zhang Haitao to threaten him.
1:33:14|1:33:18|In desperation, he tightened his index finger, trembling, and pulled the trigger.
1:33:18|1:33:24|At the critical moment, [Lin Kai] used a rocket launcher to shoot down the signal jammer one after another.
1:33:24|1:33:32|Taking advantage of everyone's attention being drawn away, [Li Jianguo] and Zhang Haitao stood up at the same time. [Li Jianguo] first drew the drug dealer's knife and slit the throats of two people.
1:33:33|1:33:38|Zhang Haitao then rolled over and used his gun to take care of the other two.
1:33:39|1:33:44|At this moment, the special police joyfully discovered that [Li Jianguo]'s location had reappeared on the map.
1:33:44|1:33:50|[Lin Kai] threw away the rocket launcher and arrived at the rooftop of another building, aiming his gun at the drug dealers and opening fire.
1:33:50|1:33:57|At this moment, [Laoying] took advantage of the chaos and stabbed [Li Jianguo] in the left shoulder, but was then shot in the right knee by him.
1:33:58|1:34:6|The drug dealer lying in ambush on the rooftop immediately opened fire at [Li Jianguo], causing him to crouch down and then drag [Zhang Haitao] as they ran downstairs.
1:34:7|1:34:14|Watching as [Laoying] picked up a gun and chased after him, [Lin Kai] immediately aimed and fired wildly, hitting him in the left shoulder.
1:34:15|1:34:25|So [Laoying] ran to the door and turned around to shoot, seeing [Lin Kai] hiding behind the wall. At the same time, with the drug dealer coming to help, he immediately chose not to fight, turned around, and left the rooftop.
1:34:26|1:34:31|At this moment, [Li Jianguo] and the other person arrived at a wall and saw [Lin Kai] on the other side, exchanging a glance.
1:34:31|1:34:39|Then, he first pulled out the knife inserted in his left shoulder, and then, pulling up [Zhang Haitao], leaped into the air, stomped on the roof, and fell into the bungalow.
1:34:43|1:34:48|Two drug dealers who were just shot at from above were picked off one by one by [Lin Kai] on the opposite rooftop.
1:35:2|1:35:6|After bumping into [Qingshui] head-on, he asked her to take away Yanan's urn.
1:35:7|1:35:13|In the factory, groups of drug dealers take out various weapons from the cabinets.
1:35:14|1:35:20|[Lin Kai] then found a rope on the rooftop, so he tied it to a wooden pole and made a tight knot.
1:35:20|1:35:31|Then he jumped off the rope and landed on the street. On the other side, [Li Jianguo] raised his hand and took out a drug dealer.
1:35:32|1:35:40|Handing the pistol to Zhang Haitao behind him, Lin Kai picked up the drug dealer's submachine gun and arrived at an alley. The two aimed around, walking back to back.
1:35:40|1:35:43|Shortly after, they stopped in front of a door connected to the street.
1:35:43|1:35:50|Through the small hole in the door, [Li Jianguo] saw [Laoying] leading a large group of drug dealers carrying submachine guns, charging forward.
1:35:50|1:35:54|The residents in the town saw the situation and hurriedly took refuge in their homes.
1:35:55|1:36:3|Shortly after, Zhang Haitao opened the car door and walked out first. Then, [Li Jianguo] led him, walking along the road, and continued forward.
1:37:7|1:37:14|Facing the rain of bullets, [Lin Kai] arrived at the rear of the team. Then, effortlessly took out a few drug dealers with precise shots.
1:37:14|1:37:18|Finally, the drug dealers in the team were almost eliminated.
1:37:20|1:37:35|He took a slight aim, and the bullet shot out from the muzzle, piercing through the shoulders of two drug dealers in succession, then straight into the left shoulder of [Laoying]. But [Laoying], as if possessing an invincible body, did not stop the shooting action at all.
1:37:36|1:37:48|Suddenly, a car drove up to the intersection ahead, and the drug dealers inside crazily shot at [Lin Kai]. Seeing an opportunity to catch their breath, [Li Jianguo] quickly pushed Zhang Haitao and darted into the small alley on the right front.
1:38:3|1:38:10|[Li Jianguo] and [Lin Kai] arrived at a path filled with potted plants, even with pursuers behind them, they quickly split up on both sides of the low wall.
1:38:10|1:38:17|The drug dealer was shot dead by [Li Jianguo] as soon as he showed up. Then, Zhang Haitao smoothly took care of the second person who followed closely.
1:38:18|1:38:29|Upon discovering only two drug dealers, [Li Jianguo] quickly picked up the submachine gun on the ground. Suddenly, a gunshot came from behind, as [Lin Kai] had shot the attacker. Then he ran over.
1:38:34|1:38:39|Zhang Haitao nodded. Then, the three of them walked towards the intersection together.
1:38:40|1:38:44|As soon as he showed up, he was shot at by the drug dealer on a motorcycle and forced back against the wall.
1:38:45|1:38:53|Seeing another sedan approaching, [Lin Kai] shot the driver in the heart and then turned around to take out the two people on the motorcycle.
1:38:56|1:39:0|Li Jianguo saw the situation and shouted loudly, causing Zhang Haitao to cover his head and run towards the direction of the car.
1:39:1|1:39:9|After opening the car door, he forcefully dragged the drug dealer on the driver's seat to the ground. [Li Jianguo] and [Lin Kai] stood back to back, clearing the drug dealers in front of them.
1:39:10|1:39:18|Suddenly, [Laoying]'s car violently crashed into the rear of Zhang Haitao's car. The two who were originally in front of the car each jumped into the alleys on both sides.
1:39:18|1:39:25|Laoying kept suppressing the enemy with firepower. At this moment, Lin Kai and Li Jianguo locked eyes and swiftly rushed towards the intersection.
1:39:25|1:39:29|In an instant, two drug dealers were killed as their figures overlapped.
1:39:30|1:39:35|Taking advantage of [Laoying] being pinned down by the dead drug dealer, [Li Jianguo] quickly climbed into the driver's seat.
1:39:36|1:39:41|[Lin Kai] saw that the vehicle was not starting, so he placed the gun on the car and pushed the back of the car with force.
1:39:42|1:39:50|At this moment, [Laoying] forcefully lifted the body, picked up the gun, and shot towards [Lin Kai]. Unfortunately, being injured by the gunshot, he missed the target.
1:39:50|1:39:56|He then turned around, got into the car, stepped on the gas pedal and accelerated towards the direction of the three people.
1:39:57|1:40:4|The massive impact provided the momentum for [Li Jianguo] to start the vehicle, so he quickly shifted gears and drove forward.
1:40:4|1:40:12|Lin Kai quickly dodged into the roadside ditch, and as he saw them accelerating away, he leaped onto a passing motorcycle and closely followed behind.
1:40:13|1:40:17|Zhang Haitao struggled to raise his gun, aiming at the car in front of him, ready to take down the drug trafficker approaching from the front at any moment.
1:40:20|1:40:27|[Laoying] stepped on the gas pedal fiercely, trying to overtake, but when it didn't work out as planned, he could only irritably use his hand to cover his left shoulder, which was constantly oozing blood.
1:40:28|1:40:39|At this moment, [Lin Kai] was chasing after them and arrived at the intersection. Just as he was about to turn, he ran into the drug dealers who came to reinforce. So he changed direction, drove into the nearby alley, lifted the front of the car, and drove upwards.
1:40:44|1:40:49|Temporarily shaking off a group of gun-wielding thugs, he rode his motorcycle into a kitchen.
1:40:49|1:40:56|Turning his head, Lin Kai saw the gas tank on the ground. He kicked the valve with his foot, then lifted the front of the car to smash the window, flying towards the opposite side.
1:40:58|1:41:5|As if he had eyes on his back, he suddenly pulled out a gun and shot the gas tank behind him.
1:41:5|1:41:11|As a result, the drug dealers who had just entered the kitchen were immediately blown up beyond recognition.
1:41:12|1:41:16|At this moment, he was hit by the explosion and crashed straight into the coffee table in the opposite hotel.
1:41:16|1:41:24|After clutching his stomach for a moment, he quickly got up, mounted the motorcycle, smashed through the door panel, and drove towards the corridor.
1:41:25|1:41:34|Lin Kai was about to go downstairs when suddenly a group of drug dealers rushed up. He stepped on the gas pedal and drove up the stairs to the rooftop.
1:41:35|1:41:41|Looking around, before he could decide which way to go, the drug dealer on the opposite rooftop spotted him.
1:41:42|1:41:46|So he had no choice but to grit his teeth and dash forward.
1:41:46|1:41:51|The drug dealer on the opposite rooftop, upon seeing the situation, immediately started shooting and spraying towards them.
1:41:51|1:41:59|Helpless, the bullets always grazed past him. Finally, the drug dealer was provoked.
1:41:59|1:42:4|One person mounted the rocket launcher on his shoulder, aimed in the direction of [Lin Kai], and fired.
1:42:4|1:42:12|The shell grazed the rear of Lin Kai's car, hitting the water tank beside him accurately, and the entire rooftop was quickly engulfed by flames and rushing water.
1:42:13|1:42:20|Taking advantage of the drug dealer's vision being blocked by the explosion, [Lin Kai] stepped on the gas pedal again, flew off the rooftop, and landed on the rooftop of another building.
1:42:22|1:42:29|Bowing his head, [Lin Kai] quickly chased after [Li Jianguo] and [Laoying] who were speeding away in a car.
1:42:29|1:42:35|At this moment, the two cars were driving one after the other and crashed into the market. All the fruits on the stalls were swept to the ground.
1:44:30|1:44:40|Seeing Laoying's car turning the corner and still closely following Li Jianguo, Lin Kai accelerated towards the car on the side of the road and leaped into the air with the help of the force. Then, with a powerful leap, he grabbed onto the roof of Laoying's car.
1:44:42|1:44:51|Sensing someone above, [Laoying] suddenly turned the steering wheel, throwing [Lin Kai] straight onto the hood of the car. The drug dealer in the back seat quickly opened fire.
1:44:51|1:44:55|Unexpectedly, after being grabbed by [Lin Kai] and clinging to the car door, he raised his hand and struck his chest.
1:44:55|1:45:2|Laoying shuddered all over, immediately steering the car towards the truck on the side of the road. Lin Kai, who was hanging on the side door, had just climbed onto the roof.
1:45:2|1:45:11|He was hit by a sudden brake and crashed into the wall in front of him. Then, [Laoying] quickly reversed, leaving [Lin Kai] on the ground, and then stepped on the gas pedal to hit him again.
1:45:12|1:45:20|Fortunately, [Lin Kai] quickly flipped over and managed to hide just below the wall and the front of the car.
1:45:20|1:45:29|Unfortunately, he was stuck right at the front wheel. [Laoying] angrily gripped the gun and forcefully opened the driver's door, getting out of the car.
1:45:30|1:45:39|[Li Jianguo] kept looking at the rearview mirror, observing if there were any vehicles following. At this moment, [Laoying] roared at [Lin Kai].
1:45:41|1:45:45|Raising the submachine gun in his hand, he aimed it at his head.
1:45:45|1:45:52|While about to pull the trigger, [Lin Kai] was hit by the speeding vehicle driven by [Li Jianguo], sending him flying into the air.
1:45:52|1:46:6|Next, [Li Jianguo] kicked open the car door, aimed the gun at the eagle lying on the ground first, then quickly approached [Lin Kai]. Without listening, [Li Jianguo] immediately opened the car door.
1:46:6|1:46:11|Upon entering the driver's seat, Lin Kai was immediately struck from behind by the drug trafficker driving towards him.
1:46:12|1:46:17|At this moment, the vehicle moved away and [Lin Kai] quickly ran to his side.
1:46:20|1:46:28|The drug dealer driving towards them crazily shoots at the car blocking the road, while [Li Jianguo] hides behind the car and demands [Lin Kai] to leave.
1:46:28|1:46:31|So, he had to quickly evacuate with [Zhang Haitao].
1:46:32|1:46:39|Driving a distance, [Lin Kai] saw through the rearview mirror that [Li Jianguo] was firmly guarding the back of the car and shooting forward.
1:46:40|1:46:47|[Zhang Haitao] turned around and watched as his figure gradually disappeared from sight.
1:46:47|1:46:54|At this moment, [Li Jianguo] shoots the drug dealer in the driver's seat in the head, then crouches down and quietly takes out the approaching drug dealer.
1:47:45|1:47:51|At this moment, a drug dealer aimed at [Lin Kai] and fired a stray bullet, which happened to hit the vehicle in front.
1:47:52|1:48:3|But [Lin Kai] showed no fear in the face of the explosion. The blazing car pushed through the vehicles at the intersection, and the drug dealers who followed hastily got into their car and accelerated to chase after [Lin Kai].
1:48:6|1:48:13|Back in the town, [Li Jianguo] was lying on the ground, clutching his chest, continuously spitting out blood.
1:48:13|1:48:31|Lying on the ground, [Laoying] suddenly woke up, struggled to lift his head and looked around. He found a submachine gun not far from himself, and also noticed [Li Jianguo] eyeing the submachine gun. So the two faced each other and scrambled towards the submachine gun.
1:48:31|1:48:40|Unfortunately, the gun was closest to [Laoying], so when he got hold of it, he shot [Li Jianguo] directly in the left shoulder.
1:48:40|1:48:45|Looking at the suffering Li Jianguo, the bloodied Laoying excitedly asked.
1:49:8|1:49:14|[Laoying] listened, widened his eyes, propped his left hand on the ground, but slowly raised the muzzle with his right hand.
1:49:14|1:49:22|Next, aiming at [Li Jianguo]'s chest, a shot was fired. Seeing [Laoying] pointing the gun at himself again,
1:49:22|1:49:27|[Qingshui] pulled the trigger without hesitation, only to have the bullet pass through his own chest.
1:49:27|1:49:36|In an instant, the urn slipped from her hands and she fell backwards on the road. At that moment, a gust of wind blew by.
1:49:36|1:49:44|Laoying, spitting blood from his mouth, saw the ashes being thrown into the air and desperately moved his head and hands.
1:49:44|1:49:50|Watching the ashes being blown away bit by bit, his eyes were red and he kept sobbing in his mouth.
1:49:50|1:49:56|Trying every possible means, Lin Kai headed towards the direction of the urn, wanting to touch and leave his own mark for Yunan to find later.
1:49:58|1:50:12|Suddenly, [Li Jianguo] opened his eyes again and looked at [Laoying], who had already crawled to his feet. He took out a short knife from behind, knelt down, and plunged it straight into [Laoying]'s back.
1:50:12|1:50:19|[Qingshui] looked at [Li Jianguo] like this, and remembered the scene of hiding under the boards as a child, watching his father being shot.
1:50:19|1:50:27|Li Jianguo gently patted her.
1:50:36|1:50:45|After speaking, [Li Jianguo] removed his hand from the corner of her mouth, then booped her nose, smiled, and finally, bent down and left from under the wooden board.
1:50:45|1:50:51|Now, seeing the man who once couldn't bear to kill himself, covered in blood.
1:50:52|1:50:57|[Qingshui] slowly closed his eyes, tears streaming down from the corners of his eyes.
1:51:12|1:51:16|The sun was setting in the west, and the three of them lay on the ground for a long time.
1:51:16|1:51:25|On the other side, [Lin Kai] drove quickly through a field of knee-high rice paddies, even though the dust kicked up blocked the view of the drug dealers behind.
1:51:25|1:51:34|But the bullets fired wildly by the opponent made him still not dare to take it lightly. At this moment, the vehicle drove through the paddy fields and arrived in the woods.
1:51:34|1:51:41|After twisting and turning, he drilled deeper. But suddenly, [Lin Kai] noticed that Zhang Haitao was no longer making any noise.
1:51:51|1:51:59|After speaking, [Lin Kai] stepped on the gas pedal fiercely, passing through another bend, while the drug trafficker behind him mounted a machine gun and chased relentlessly.
1:51:59|1:52:7|At this moment, [Lin Kai] stretched his neck and looked up at the sky. After observing the direction in which the leaves were swaying, he took out a signal gun from his pocket.
1:52:7|1:52:14|Next, a signal flare with a special marking bloomed above the river.
1:52:20|1:52:24|In the helicopter, the pilot quickly reported the direction upon seeing the signal flare.
1:52:25|1:52:29|The special police officers rushing to the river drove the airship towards the target location.
1:52:29|1:52:38|At this moment, [Lin Kai] emerged from the woods, under the crazy gunfire of the drug traffickers, he stepped on the gas pedal hard and drove straight towards the river.
1:52:38|1:52:48|Before falling into the water, [Lin Kai] threw himself towards [Zhang Haitao], using his body to block most of the impact from the rushing water, and then pushed him out of the car with all his strength.
1:52:49|1:52:54|At this moment, [Zhang Haitao] used both hands and feet to emerge from the water, taking big breaths of fresh air.
1:52:54|1:53:0|Lin Kai was not seen surfacing for a long time, as his shoelace got tangled in the clutch.
1:53:0|1:53:7|He gritted his teeth, bent down and fumbled. Finally, before running out of breath, he successfully surfaced.
1:53:7|1:53:18|The two figures were quickly captured by the armed police on the airship. Before the drug dealers could shoot at them, they continued to suppress the firepower on the shore.
1:53:19|1:53:24|Seeing the reinforcements arriving, the drug dealers quickly retreated and slipped into the car, preparing to make a quick getaway.
1:53:25|1:53:29|But the special police had already locked down all of [Laoying]'s strongholds in the small town.
1:53:29|1:53:34|The drug manufacturing plant and the transportation line were all wiped out by a large number of armed forces.
1:53:34|1:53:44|Next, [Lin Kai] and Zhang Haitao were pulled onto the airship, escorted by multiple helicopters, turned a corner, facing the setting sun, and headed towards China.
1:54:14|1:54:22|[Lin Kai] in police uniform, arrived at the cemetery.
1:54:33|1:54:41|As soon as Director Lin finished speaking, nearly 50 police officers holding their police caps solemnly saluted.
1:54:43|1:54:49|Standing on both sides of Chief Lin were [Lin Kai] and Zhang Haitao, looking at the tombstone of [Li Jianguo], unwilling to lower their right hands from the salute for a long time.
1:55:11|1:55:16|At this moment, [Lin Kai] recalled the instructions given to him by the director in the office.
1:55:16|1:55:24|Finally, unable to hold back the tears, [Lin Kai] wept. Meanwhile, [Laoying] sat in a wheelchair, gazing at his 36-year-old comrade.
