0:0:31|0:0:37|The dark night seemed to be painted with thick ink on the horizon, not even a trace of starlight could be seen.
0:0:37|0:0:42|In the woods, a group of fairies disguised as humans, singing and dancing, creating a lively atmosphere.
0:1:9|0:1:15|In this first part of the movie, after parting ways with [Huo Ba], [Song Tianyin] sets out on a journey to find her father with [Huo Xiaolan].
0:1:15|0:1:22|With the help of [Yun Qing], the two learned about the fox demon's scheme of [Song Tianyin]'s father, and [Huo Ba] who returned to Yongning Village was once again chased by the demon king.
0:2:6|0:2:11|Little [Huo Xiaolan] looked at everyone panting and jumping around, extremely happy.
0:2:11|0:2:17|At this moment, half of the Blood Demon's head emerged from the ground.
0:2:23|0:2:32|Before everyone could react, a huge and muscular blood demon burst out of the ground and charged towards [Huo Ba]. Seeing this, [Pang Ying] quickly picked up [Huo Ba] and fled towards the outskirts of the village.
0:2:39|0:2:46|Cornered by three blood demons, the desperate couple [Pang Ying] and [Hu Ba] held on to each other. Just as the group was at a loss, the ground beneath their feet suddenly cracked open.
0:2:46|0:2:50|A larger four-winged demon leaped from the ground and sent everyone flying several yards away.
0:2:50|0:2:58|[Zhu Gao] saw that [Hu Ba] was about to fall into the hands of Xiaoyao, so he shouted "Pang Ying" and ran. Then, Pang Ying forcefully threw the slender [Zhu Gao] away.
0:2:58|0:3:5|At the critical moment, [Tu Sigu] caught [Huo Xiaolan] in the air, and the blood demon who was surrounding them hurried to intercept. [Tu Sigu] then quickly threw [Huo Xiaolan] towards Xiao Wu.
0:3:5|0:3:12|At this moment, the four blood demons rushed towards the fleeing Xiaowu like mad. [Tu Sigu] and others also chased after them, with [Tu Sigu] devising a battle plan.
0:3:18|0:3:22|The group of people formed a moving formation, passing [Huo Xiaolan] to each other in perfect coordination.
0:3:22|0:3:29|At this moment, a desperate blood demon failed to dodge in time and crashed into a tree, followed by another blood demon pouncing towards Xiao Wu.
0:3:35|0:3:42|Tu Sigu jumped up and slammed Huo Xiaolan onto a tree trunk, just as several villagers lifted a tree trunk together to smash the two blood demons flying towards them.
0:3:43|0:3:50|The blood demon fell to the ground, paralyzed, at this moment [Huo Xiaolan] also slowly descended from the tree, while the four-winged demon on the side angrily roared at the sky.
0:3:51|0:3:56|Tu Sigu then used his strong tail to throw everyone away one after another, and then looked ferociously at little Hu Ba, who looked like a baby.
0:3:56|0:4:4|Using the same method, after tossing [Huo Xiaolan] into the air, the Four-Winged Demon firmly catches her and, without any hesitation, spreads its wings and flies into the sky to complete the mission.
0:4:4|0:4:16|At this moment, two villagers suddenly grabbed its feet. Tu Sigu turned around and saw three villagers flying from the ground, firmly holding onto it, preventing it from flying away. The villagers tightly held onto the ankles of the person in front, dragging the Four-Winged Demon like a chain.
0:4:20|0:4:29|After that, [Tu Sigu] and Pang Ying climbed up the human ladder formed by the villagers, and when they reached the top of the Four-Winged Demon, the two of them leaped high together and then heavily slammed down on the Four-Winged Demon.
0:4:29|0:4:34|The tall figure of [Tu Sigu] was stunned to the ground by the crowd, but the little Hu Ba in its hand accidentally rolled into the river nearby.
0:4:34|0:4:43|At this moment, [Pang Ying] and [Zhu Gao] had just stood up when they were knocked down by the tail of [Tu Sigu]. Worriedly, [Pang Ying] asked:
0:5:26|0:5:45|A gust of demon wind swept up the golden sand on the ground in the cave, and the sand intertwined in the air to form the title of the film "Monster Hunt 2". Poor little Huba drifted in the river all night, and the sudden waterfall made Huba widen his eyes, while the water flow also rapidly increased.
0:5:47|0:5:51|Huo Ba was caught off guard and swept down to a waterfall nearly a hundred meters high.
0:5:51|0:6:0|At the moment when Huba fell off the cliff, [Huo Xiaolan] at the inn furrowed her brows and caught a glimpse of the swift water flow.
0:6:2|0:6:8|After listening, Doctor Tu Sigu checked Xiaolan's pulse and said to his assistant:
0:7:8|0:7:24|The doctor beckoned, and [Song Tianyin] approached. He pinched his nose and shook it, saying, "8528 Assistant saw the doctor's gesture and picked up a piece of white cloth, took some soil from the flowerpot nearby, and placed it on the table."
0:7:24|0:7:30|As she was about to pack up, Tu Sigu was stopped by the doctor. The doctor extended his finger, stuck it in the soil, and then tasted it.
0:7:30|0:7:37|The assistant then packed it up and handed it to [Huo Xiaolan].
0:8:1|0:8:6|[Huo Xiaolan] hurriedly pulled [Song Tianyin] away, and the people who came for treatment lined up in a long queue.
0:8:6|0:8:12|[Huo Xiaolan] looked tenderly at the baby in a mother's arms, feeling a surge of longing for Huba.
0:8:13|0:8:29|Xiaolan then walked to the side and said to [Song Tianyin]: At this moment, a pregnant woman with a big belly rushed towards Xiaolan. Feeling something strange, Xiaolan pushed hard and ended up bouncing herself out of the window.
0:8:29|0:8:35|Xiaolan questioned fiercely, asking with a pregnant woman unharmed.
0:8:37|0:8:45|Huo Xiaolan swiftly pasted the talisman on her forehead, and the pregnant woman could no longer move.
0:8:45|0:8:53|It turned out to be a demon. While she was still basking in the applause, six demons wearing human skins appeared on the roof.
0:8:53|0:9:1|The six demons leaped down and landed beside Boss Zhu, who had just been immobilized. One of them tore off the talisman on his forehead, and then the seven demons growled lowly, assuming a fighting stance.
0:9:1|0:9:11|Xiaolan, seeing the situation turning against her, kicked over the bamboo basket and ran into the crowd. With a command from the boss, the monsters chased after her while making strange noises, causing the townspeople to flee in a panic.
0:9:11|0:9:20|Although the demon was wearing human skin, when chasing people, it still used both hands and feet, crawling on the ground. Upon seeing this, [Song Tianyin] on the second floor also jumped down and immediately chased after them.
0:9:21|0:9:28|At this moment, Huo Xiaolan, who was running, was almost knocked down by the approaching monster. She dared not slack off at all, and could only run desperately in the face of the monster.
0:9:28|0:9:35|Just then, a monster suddenly leaped out from the front path, blocking Xiaolan's way. Surrounded, Xiaolan quickly drew out her magic rope and leaped up.
0:9:36|0:9:44|A whip knocked down the monster blocking the way, while [Song Tianyin] behind calmed the elderly man who was hit, and then entrusted the luggage to him.
0:9:50|0:9:55|Facing the attacks of the monsters, [Huo Xiaolan], who was struggling, swung the magic rope towards the top of the city wall, preparing to escape.
0:9:55|0:9:58|Looking at [Huo Xiaolan] in the air, the demon seemed to have not given up.
0:9:58|0:10:8|With a strong leap, [Tu Sigu] grabbed her. At this moment, other monsters rushed over, and a running monster collided with a mother holding a baby on the road, causing the baby in her arms to be thrown far away.
0:10:8|0:10:17|[Song Tianyin] saw the baby in the air and leaped without hesitation, catching him securely in his arms, only to crash heavily into the wall the next second.
0:10:17|0:10:20|Song Tianyin, who had just regained consciousness, breathed a sigh of relief as he looked at the baby in his arms.
0:10:20|0:10:26|On the other side, [Huo Xiaolan], who was lying on the ground, struggled hard with the rope, looking at the almost bitten-through rope, she managed to free herself from the restraint.
0:10:26|0:10:34|As Ke Gang stood up, he was immediately hit hard on the head, causing him to feel dizzy. Facing the encirclement of the powerful demon, [Huo Xiaolan] could only force herself to stay standing and not collapse.
0:10:35|0:10:43|At this moment, as long as they all move forward to firmly control her, the boss leaps into the air and smashes down towards [Huo Xiaolan], but suddenly the boss in the air is pulled away by a magic rope.
0:10:43|0:10:48|Before the others could react, the other six demons were also dragged away and placed on the city wall.
0:10:48|0:10:51|When [Huo Xiaolan] looked up along the rope.
0:10:51|0:10:55|A man in Daoist robes with a furry tail flew over from the top and landed steadily on the high platform.
0:10:55|0:11:5|After locking eyes with Tu Sigu, Huo Xiaolan almost immediately guessed the man's identity. The common people, who only realized it later, watched the demon-hunting celestial master with such skill as if they had seen a hero, clapping excitedly.
0:11:5|0:11:14|Both as a celestial master, [Huo Xiaolan] looked at him with a hint of dissatisfaction, while the man turned back and smiled and waved at [Huo Xiaolan].
0:11:42|0:11:54|[Huo Xiaolan] shook her head, and [Song Tianyin] asked after seeing the man's waist badge. The man didn't answer in a hurry, but walked up and took the leaves off [Song Tianyin]'s body, asking back:
0:12:6|0:12:14|After saying that, [Yun Qing] left gracefully. Walking among the crowd, [Yun Qing] was constantly praised by the people with thumbs up. Walking on the street, [Huo Xiaolan] pondered and said:
0:12:27|0:12:43|The two had just taken a few steps when they heard the distant thunder. [Huo Xiaolan] looked at the dark clouds and said, "At this moment, [Huo Xiaolan] noticed a doll made of cloth that looked like a Hu Ba model made by [Song Tianyin]."
0:13:1|0:13:7|Huo Xiaolan, who was knocked unconscious by the waterfall, drifted along the water on the lake at the same time.
0:13:7|0:13:12|After waking up, Tu Sigu walked to the shore and shook off the water from his body like a puppy.
0:13:12|0:13:20|It stood on a dry tree trunk, staring with big eyes at the unfamiliar forest, feeling a bit lost for a moment, then wandering aimlessly through the woods.
0:13:20|0:13:27|Tu Sigu didn't brighten up until he walked in front of [Yun Qing], who swallowed [Yun Qing] without any hesitation, but spat it out after just a few bites.
0:13:30|0:13:35|Hu Ba looked up at the sky following the dancing dandelions, the shape of the clouds resembling a family of three holding hands.
0:13:36|0:13:44|Watching [Yun Qing] in the film, Tu Sigu also recalled the happy times with [Huo Xiaolan]. At this moment, a roar interrupted Tu Sigu's reminiscence.
0:13:44|0:13:53|Tu Sigu quickly hid behind a tree upon hearing the noise. Before he could catch his breath, he saw a child in a monster costume appear behind him.
0:13:53|0:14:1|Hu Ba turned around and burst into laughter at the extremely ugly stitched clothing.
0:14:8|0:14:16|At this moment, the friends all rushed over and stared blankly at Huba. One of them approached and said:
0:14:24|0:14:43|A group of children were chasing Huba through the woods, they were in the mountains next to Qingshui Town. At this moment, the shouting broke the original peace and tranquility of Jinshui Town.
0:14:43|0:14:57|One of the children fell while chasing Hu Ba into the bustling town, which made Hu Ba, hidden in the lion head mask, laugh out loud.
0:14:57|0:15:3|Everyone followed the laughter and looked at Tu Sigu in unison. Seeing something was wrong, Tu Sigu jumped out of the lion's head and ran away.
0:15:3|0:15:10|Tu Sigu sneaked behind a carriage through the streets and alleys.
0:15:10|0:15:14|Just as he was about to turn around and look at the pursuers, a monster's big hand grabbed him and pulled him away.
0:15:27|0:15:34|At this moment, the monster Tu Sigu, who can turn invisible in the car, slowly appears while holding Huo Xiaolan.
0:15:35|0:15:44|Before [Tu Sigu] could even laugh, the child who heard the noise opened the car door again. Fortunately, [Tu Sigu] reacted quickly and immediately hid when the car door opened.
0:15:45|0:15:50|Later, everyone gathered at the car door and confirmed once again before saying:
0:15:57|0:16:9|After the children walked away, [Tu Sigu] slowly appeared. The big and round [Tu Sigu] placed [Huo Xiaolan] on the seat, touched its head, and made funny faces to amuse [Huo Xiaolan].
0:16:9|0:16:17|[Huo Ba] happily pulled [Benben]'s head, although it hurt, [Benben] didn't get angry, he rubbed his head and asked [Huo Ba] where he came from.
0:16:18|0:16:24|[Huo Ba] jumped off the seat, walked to the wooden door and paused for a moment, then used his teeth to bite out the shape of the cloud he had just seen on the wooden board.
0:16:26|0:16:35|Benny suddenly realized when he saw Tu Sigu, and there was a commotion coming from the courtyard wall next to the carriage.
0:16:35|0:16:38|Entering the courtyard following the sound, it turned out to be the gambling den in Qingshui Town.
0:16:44|0:16:50|The casino is divided into 3 levels, with a total of 10 gambling tables. The decor is luxurious, with one gambling table for big and small games on the 2nd floor.
0:16:50|0:16:58|Wearing a suit of golden armor, [Tu Sigu] pressed several hundred taels of silver onto the table.
0:17:20|0:17:27|[Tu Sigu] followed the sound and saw a graceful and sexy beauty coming down the stairs. The beauty walked slowly to the opposite side of [Tu Sigu] and after a moment of eye contact, she said,
0:17:48|0:18:3|Tu Sigu pushed all the silver ingots to the middle of the table. Then he picked up three dice and placed them in front of the beautiful woman. After blowing into the dice cup, he threw the dice in one by one, shaking them a few times before slamming them heavily on the table.
0:18:5|0:18:11|And at this moment, the little monster hidden in the dice cup quickly adjusted all the dice to show 6.
0:18:12|0:18:20|[Tu Sigu] was not convinced by the beauty, so he slid the wine cup from the table to the beauty's hand. The beauty caught the wine cup steadily and then calmly took off the sleeve of her right arm.
0:18:20|0:18:26|Tu Sigu then picked up the dice cup, skillfully scooped up the dice on the table, and then shook them at lightning speed.
0:18:26|0:18:29|A simple pause made the little monster in the colored cup dizzy.
0:18:30|0:18:40|When everyone was eagerly waiting for the dice to be rolled, the beautiful woman threw the dice cup into the air, crossed her arms to catch it, let the dice cup roll from high to low to the other arm's elbow, then she suddenly raised her elbow and threw the dice cup into the air again.
0:18:40|0:18:50|The beautiful woman spun around to the astonishment of everyone, then, using a color bowl, forcefully slammed it on the table. She glanced at [Tu Sigu] before suddenly lifting the color bowl.
0:18:50|0:18:56|After hearing a burst of hissing, [Huo Xiaolan] looked incredulously at the three ones on the table, and at that moment, a little monster in the colored cup spat out.
0:19:27|0:19:30|Tu Sigu saw the situation was not good and ran downstairs.
0:19:30|0:19:39|Not long after taking a few steps, they were blocked by thugs. The thugs rushed forward to grab them, but unexpectedly, [Tu Sigu] slipped under the table like a cicada shedding its skin. Taking advantage of the chaos, the little monsters also quietly slipped away.
0:19:39|0:19:44|Tu Sigu under the table took off his fake beard and sneaked out in the chaos, shouting "Catch the thief!" pointing downstairs.
0:19:53|0:19:59|Facing the pursuit of the crowd, he hurriedly ran up to the third floor. Passing by the gambling table, he scattered the silver coins on the table to the people behind him.
0:19:59|0:20:7|As chaos ensued, [Tu Sigu] slid down a pillar from the third floor to the first floor, escaped the encirclement, and shouted loudly after breaking through the casino door:
0:20:12|0:20:26|Tu Sigu saw Benben stick out two legs from under the car, drove the car to him, and after Tu Sigu got in and fastened his seatbelt, Benben ran forward recklessly in the car. When the car reached a stone arch bridge, Tu Sigu took a deep breath, and their wooden cart soared into the sky along the ramp.
0:20:34|0:20:41|When Benben reacted, the wooden cart fell heavily from a height of several meters, but fortunately the cart was sturdy and did not fall apart.
0:20:41|0:20:49|Just as [Tu Sigu] regained consciousness, he quickly controlled the direction of the car to avoid obstacles. The car drifted into a narrow alley, speeding away but still unable to shake off the pursuers behind.
0:20:49|0:21:6|[Tu Sigu] was still worried about the pursuers when another group of people and horses appeared ahead. Seeing this, [Tu Sigu] urgently hit the brakes, patted the carriage, and shouted loudly. Hearing this, the person named Beng Beng quickly turned around and ran towards a tunnel.
0:21:8|0:21:12|The notorious Tu Sigu is wanted even by the elderly with white hair.
0:21:13|0:21:20|When about to be caught up, the car drove out of the tunnel, pulling down the wooden curtain in passing, causing the pursuers to fall to the ground.
0:21:21|0:21:23|Upon hearing the command, [Tu Sigu] turned around and ran.
0:21:23|0:21:30|When [Tu Sigu] turned into a small alley, he looked around and pressed the switch on the car.
0:21:30|0:21:38|The curtain, which was as thick as the wall, quickly dropped down.
0:21:44|0:21:52|The awakened thug rushed out of the curtain and continued to chase. Just as he was about to hit the extremely narrow alley, [Tu Sigu] took a deep breath, and the car seemed to slim down as if inhaling.
0:21:52|0:21:57|Through narrow alleyways, [Tu Sigu] weaved through the streets, turning left and right.
0:21:57|0:22:4|Even so, [Tu Sigu] couldn't shake off the pursuers. He then went through the alley and used the same trick again, creating another cloth curtain.
0:22:4|0:22:13|The thugs, upon seeing this, rushed out without thinking, only to find themselves falling into a pond ahead that they couldn't stop in time.
0:22:14|0:22:22|[Tu Sigu] looked back at the people who fell into the water, leisurely walking from the town to the woods. In the evening, the little monster was angry and said,
0:23:48|0:23:56|Then he kicked it into the woods, and Tu Sigu cursed when he saw it:
0:24:5|0:24:11|While speaking, [Tu Sigu] picked up the freshly made porridge by [Benben] and took a sip.
0:24:43|0:24:48|[Tu Sigu] turned around and looked at [Huo Xiaolan], grabbing her hair and lifting her up after she finished her porridge.
0:24:58|0:25:7|After saying that, Tu Sigu kicked Huo Xiaolan into the woods with one kick. But as he turned around, he was knocked unconscious by a punch from the man in black.
0:25:10|0:25:25|The next morning, [Huo Xiaolan] and [Song Tianyin] arrived at the Tian Shi Tang as planned. The Tian Shi Tang was built on the peak of the highest mountain next to Qing Shui Town. The magnificent architecture of Tian Shi Tang, built near the mountain, was enough to make all the demons retreat just by its momentum.
0:25:26|0:25:33|[Huo Xiaolan] and Tu Sigu arrived just in time for the distribution of provisions at the Tian Shi Tang. As they passed through the huge main gate, they were stunned into silence by the majestic decoration of the main hall.
0:25:33|0:25:40|In front of the eyes are eight giant bronze chandeliers hanging from the constellation of Taurus, with a lifelike giant bronze qilin placed on each side of the main entrance.
0:25:41|0:25:46|The grand hall was illuminated by hundreds of small lamps, shining brightly and magnificently.
0:25:46|0:26:6|At this moment, the two saw a monster hiding and sneaking around. They were puzzled when they heard the Taoist priest on the second floor shouting with a weapon in hand, rushing towards the main entrance to stab the monster. They were blocked by [Huo Xiaolan] who was recording, and in a moment of urgency, the monster revealed its spikes and scared the two away. Three Taoist priests with weapons followed closely behind, and [Huo Xiaolan] couldn't bear to say,
0:26:16|0:26:22|[Song Tianyin] looked at the piles of gold and silver and sighed.
0:26:34|0:26:46|[Huo Xiaolan] taunted [Song Tianyin] and then walked upstairs. [Song Tianyin] was used to it and didn't pay much attention, following closely behind up the stairs of the Celestial Master's Hall. When they reached the open door of the Demon Hunting Court, which was empty, the two of them stopped in their tracks.
0:26:46|0:26:52|This place, although called the Demon-catching Pavilion, is more like a miscellaneous room. The two of them walked in curiously, looking at the tools of various shapes.
0:26:52|0:27:0|Approaching, they found the room messy but well-equipped, and [Song Tianyin] couldn't help but curiously touch things.
0:27:0|0:27:3|Voices could be heard from behind the curtain at this moment.
0:28:50|0:28:54|After saying that, [Huo Xiaolan] caught up with [Song Tianyin] who was leaving in anger and mischievously asked.
0:29:14|0:29:18|In the magnificent Zhenjin Bank, the moneylender Boss Zhu, dressed in a black robe, enters the hall.
0:29:18|0:29:25|When Boss Zhu sat down, his henchman walked up to the bound Tu Sigu, dipped his hand in a bowl of water, and then smashed it hard against the unconscious Tu Sigu.
0:29:25|0:29:36|Tu Sigu, who was awakened, looked around in panic and then fixed his gaze on the familiar Boss Zhu in the hall.
0:29:52|0:29:55|After speaking, [Huo Xiaolan] walked up to Tu Sigu and asked aggressively.
0:29:56|0:30:1|Then he took out the contract signed by [Tu Sigu].
0:30:36|0:30:42|Boss Zhu moves Tu Sigu's chair to the back.
0:30:42|0:30:48|Eight tall and strikingly beautiful women slowly walked down the stairs from behind, said [Boss Zhu].
0:30:50|0:30:57|Tu Sigu looked at the fans with words written on them in their hands, knowing that this was not a beauty pageant, and then asked Boss Zhu with a look of melancholy.
0:31:3|0:31:7|Tu Sigu watched as Boss Zhu wrote the words "marriage" on the fan, and decided to make a choice. So Boss Zhu unlocked Tu Sigu's handcuffs.
0:31:7|0:31:14|In front of Tu Sigu, each of the 8 beauties across from him holds a ribbon, with the ribbons crisscrossing in front of him, making it difficult to distinguish.
0:31:14|0:31:20|[Tu Sigu] tried to be clever, picked up a ribbon and shook it, but when he saw 8 ribbons trembling together, [Tu Sigu] casually pulled one off.
0:31:30|0:31:41|When Tu Sigu looked back at the beauty, he saw her holding a wolf's teeth club, with countless sharp spikes on his scalp, causing unbearable pain.
0:32:2|0:32:9|Shortly after [Tu Sigu] had his shoes removed and was secured to a chair, he was puzzled as a beautiful woman began tickling his feet with a feather.
0:32:28|0:32:35|At this moment, the henchman walked up to [Boss Zhu] and said.
0:32:40|0:32:50|After listening, Boss Zhu came to the award recipient with Huba's portrait. The first person who claimed the prize took out a human-shaped radish and placed it in front of Boss Zhu.
0:32:50|0:33:0|The second one is a small dog with grass tied on its head, and the third one, most exaggeratedly, is an adult pretending to be Hu Ba by carrying their own child.
0:33:10|0:33:17|Boss Zhu approached Tu Sigu, who had a pale face, and said to the beautiful women:
0:33:43|0:34:2|After listening, Tu Sigu nodded vigorously at Boss Zhu. Back at the Tian Shi Tang, Huo Xiaolan and Song Tianyin were fooling around, inadvertently arriving at the door of a particularly solemn room. The plaque on the door read "Wu Yao Ting" in big characters. The two, still full of curiosity, walked in. Sunlight shone through the bagua-shaped window onto the table inside the room, where neatly arranged spirit tablets were placed.
0:34:2|0:34:6|Seeing the many memorial tablets, the two not only did not avoid them, but instead seemed more interested.
0:34:6|0:34:9|[Song Tianyin] put down the backpack and walked to the middle of the row along the steps.
0:34:10|0:34:14|He immediately saw his father Song Daitian's tablet placed right in the center.
0:34:14|0:34:24|So [Song Tianyin] climbed onto the table to check the rankings, while [Huo Xiaolan] shouted.
0:34:40|0:34:50|Amidst the astonishment of everyone, [Yun Qing] arrived with the team.
0:36:36|0:36:42|In the courtyard, the three of them stood in the middle of the circle. [Yun Qing] saw the confusion on the faces of the other two, so she introduced them:
0:37:10|0:37:25|After being struck by a stick, the Mother Thorn Demon voluntarily lay on the disc of the Sands of Longing. As soon as she spoke, the disc slowly descended, and then she spat out a large amount of gravel from the dragon's mouth in front.
0:37:26|0:37:33|The fine gravel, under the shining sun, unexpectedly emitted a slightly dazzling light. When the sand reached a certain amount, Longzui stopped spitting sand.
0:37:33|0:37:41|Instead, in place of it was a portion of fine sand from the vast sand pit intertwining and floating in the air, momentarily forming the appearance of a small thorn demon.
0:37:41|0:37:49|This scene left the first-time viewers [Song Tianyin] and [Huo Xiaolan] stunned, even the mischievous little paper man of [Huo Xiaolan] was drawn out to take a look.
0:37:49|0:37:52|The transformed Little Thorn Demon is dancing in the air at this moment.
0:37:52|0:37:56|Although made of gravel, the body movements and expressions are so vividly recreated that even Tu Sigu couldn't help but call out to the demon mother.
0:38:0|0:38:9|The mother of the demon looked tenderly at her son's figure, tears swirling in her eyes, but at this moment the sand changed into the shape of a mountain peak near the Celestial Masters Sect.
0:38:17|0:38:25|After [Yun Qing] agreed to [Huo Xiaolan]'s request, in the blink of an eye, the group of celestial masters arrived at the foot of the Heavenly Book Cliff. The celestial masters split into two teams and searched for the little thorn demon in the woods.
0:38:25|0:38:29|Huo Xiaolan did not make a fuss after discovering the claw marks left by the Little Four Demons on the tree trunk.
0:38:29|0:38:41|[Song Tianyin] suddenly shouted, and after hearing his mother, the little thorn demon appeared from behind the tree trunk. [Song Tianyin] turned around and looked at the little thorn demon.
0:38:41|0:38:58|Before his smile could linger for long, Tu Sigu was knocked down by Xiaociyao. Xiaociyao asked, and at that moment, a celestial master threw a dart at Xiaociyao.
0:38:58|0:39:4|After the Little Thorn Demon agilely dodged, it quickly escaped into the woods, and the nearby Taoists rushed over to support upon hearing the commotion.
0:39:4|0:39:9|The little thorn demon was fleeing everywhere, but was suddenly knocked down by a hammer from the side by [Song Tianyin].
0:39:9|0:39:16|A celestial master swung a long axe towards the little thorn demon, but was stopped by Song Tianyin with a sword.
0:39:23|0:39:30|At this moment, [Yun Qing] leaped from a distance, stepping on the shoulders of the two, performing a neat backflip and landing next to [Song Tianyin], with [Huo Xiaolan] hurrying over.
0:39:53|0:39:55|Huo Xiaolan then took the lead in squatting at the entrance where the little thorn demon drilled in.
0:39:56|0:40:3|Through the narrow opening, [Huo Xiaolan] saw the little thorn demon trembling, curled up in the corner, and said gently.
0:40:18|0:40:21|After listening to Xiao Ciyao's words, [Song Tianyin] looked at the Taoists with a gaze full of blame.
0:40:21|0:40:30|At this moment, [Huo Xiaolan] noticed the wound of the little thorn demon.
0:40:32|0:40:41|Song Tianyin looked happily at the Little Thorn Demon again after hearing it, and Huo Xiaolan at the cave entrance suddenly said to it sadly.
0:40:49|0:40:58|Upon hearing these words, Little Thorn Demon couldn't contain her longing for her mother, and started to cry in the cave. [Huo Xiaolan] looked gently at Little Thorn Demon, and was reminded of Huba in a trance.
0:41:8|0:41:14|Although facing the Stinger 1 at this moment, the words spoken are more like a true expression of feelings towards [Huo Xiaolan].
0:41:15|0:41:24|Huo Xiaolan recalled the joys and sorrows with Hu Ba, and remembered the scene when they separated. [Huo Xiaolan] stood from a mother's perspective and spoke to the Little Thorn Demon about the world.
0:41:49|0:42:4|Upon hearing the agreement from Little Thorn Demon, [Yun Qing] showed a relieved smile, while [Song Tianyin] gently comforted the distressed [Huo Xiaolan]. Afterwards, Little Thorn Demon took the initiative to leave the cave and walked towards the Celestial Master's Mansion with the others.
0:42:4|0:42:10|On the other side, in order to repay the debt, [Tu Sigu] brought Benben back to the woods where they kicked Hu Ba last night.
0:42:58|0:43:8|Tu Sigu finished speaking and continued to search for Benben who was scolded, walking unhappily in the other direction. Unexpectedly, as soon as he turned around, he bumped into Hu Ba. Hu Ba happily opened his arms to hug Benben.
0:43:10|0:43:16|Just as Beng Beng was about to pick up Huba, he cleverly hid upon hearing the voice of [Tu Sigu].
0:43:22|0:43:28|Knowing about Tu Sigu's invisibility ability, he turned slowly towards the direction of the faint laughter after hearing it.
0:43:28|0:43:36|Tu Sigu, who knows Bumbum very well, kicks the stone in front of him.
0:43:50|0:43:58|After that, [Tu Sigu] and Benben walked to the car with Xiaohuba. They were each enjoying a corn, but Benben's corn suddenly fell on the ground.
0:44:22|0:44:30|The mother walked through the bars of the cell, holding her son's hand to comfort him, then reached out to play with the little thorn demon.
0:44:58|0:45:7|Turning around, [Huo Xiaolan] went to the shelf behind to look for the key. Seeing the key locked on the shelf, she didn't hesitate to pick up an iron rod and started smashing it.
0:45:7|0:45:16|The jarring knocking sound attracted the patrolling celestial master to the door. Just as the celestial master was about to push the door open, he was pushed back by [Song Tianyin] inside the room.
0:45:16|0:45:24|Upon seeing the situation, the celestial master exerted all his strength to open the door. He looked in astonishment as the demon mother and child emerged from the cage, when suddenly [Huo Xiaolan] struck a blow.
0:45:25|0:45:32|[Song Tianyin] stealthily jumped over from the Tian Shi and looked puzzledly at [Huo Xiaolan], who suddenly realized.
0:45:34|0:45:36|After speaking, Tu Sigu disguised the celestial master as if he were drunk.
0:45:37|0:45:44|The Taoist priest looked at the key and the bottle of wine in his hand with a puzzled expression.
0:45:57|0:46:5|In the money house, the beautiful women are dressing up for [Boss Zhu], who scolds the women and then mutters to himself in front of the mirror.
0:46:7|0:46:18|Returning to the Celestial Master Temple once again, after releasing the little demon, [Huo Xiaolan] was taking a bath in the room, while [Song Tianyin] struggled to use his psychic power to fill the bathtub with water for [Huo Xiaolan], as the water ladle wobbled and flew unsteadily from above the screen.
0:46:18|0:46:23|With the change of gestures by [Song Tianyin], the water scoop tilted and poured water on [Huo Xiaolan].
0:46:23|0:46:30|Song Tianyin scooped up another ladle of water with a gourd.
0:46:33|0:46:38|But this time, distracted [Song Tianyin] poured the water directly on [Huo Xiaolan]'s head.
0:46:46|0:46:52|Eating dried fruits nervously while sitting on the table, [Tu Sigu] talks to [Huo Xiaolan].
0:47:11|0:47:15|Tu Sigu and Boss Zhu were waiting in the money house at this time.
0:47:16|0:47:21|Shortly after, [Boss Zhu] appeared in luxurious attire and exquisite makeup, escorted by eight beautiful women.
0:47:22|0:47:31|At this moment, [Boss Zhu] moved the fan in front of him aside, revealing an exceptionally delicate makeup.
0:48:4|0:48:10|Just then, Tu Sigu made a funny face to scare Huo Xiaolan.
0:48:56|0:49:2|On the other side, [Huo Xiaolan] pouted and waited for [Song Tianyin] to approach in order to make it up to him. [Song Tianyin] also pouted and moved closer.
0:50:6|0:50:12|In the room, [Huo Xiaolan] pouted again. [Song Tianyin], who had been hit twice, looked at [Huo Xiaolan] with lingering fear and dared not approach.
0:50:13|0:50:19|Just as [Song Tianyin] was trying to get closer little by little, [Clumsy] scared [Huo Xiaolan] again.
0:50:19|0:50:26|Huo Xiaolan's expression was off, and Song Tianyin cleverly dodged backwards. At this moment, Boss Zhu's big face appeared in front of the two.
0:50:26|0:50:35|Huo Xiaolan, afraid, throws a dart forward, while Tu Sigu raises his hand to strike forward.
0:50:35|0:50:42|But when he came to his senses and looked at [Boss Zhu], he then proceeded to support her shoulder.
0:50:44|0:50:51|At this moment, a dart sliced through Song Tianyin's belt, causing his pants to fall to the ground in front of Huo Xiaolan.
0:51:4|0:51:12|Tu Sigu, who walked out of the gate, found Benben laughing heartily.
0:51:29|0:51:38|Huo Xiaolan then showed him around.
0:51:38|0:51:44|Tu Sigu, who knows the truth, was filled with evil thoughts.
0:51:46|0:51:54|Boss Zhu, followed by two henchmen, chased after them. Upon seeing this, Tu Sigu hurried forward to speak.
0:52:8|0:52:17|Tu Sigu unexpectedly grabbed Boss Zhu's hand and placed it on his chest, saying affectionately.
0:52:19|0:52:26|The two attendants shook their heads desperately, while [Boss Zhu], who was deeply involved, nodded affectionately.
0:52:38|0:52:45|[Tu Sigu] stamped his own handprint, and just as he was about to give it to [Boss Zhu], he romantically took out a handful of gold powder.
0:52:45|0:52:51|He evenly sprinkled gold powder on the large "love" character, then blew off the excess powder, and handed it to [Boss Zhu] with a satisfied look on his face.
0:52:51|0:52:58|Boss Zhu took the oath and looked happily at the words above. Then Tu Sigu gestured for his men to hand over the silver to him.
0:52:58|0:53:4|Seeing his subordinates unwilling, [Tu Sigu] forcefully snatched the silver and then said to [Boss Zhu].
0:53:4|0:53:13|Seeing Boss Zhu nodding happily, Tu Sigu got on the wooden cart and left with a flourish, not forgetting to wave to Boss Zhu along the way.
0:53:13|0:53:23|Watching the receding figure of [Tu Sigu], his subordinate sighed.
0:53:39|0:53:47|Boss Zhu took a deep breath helplessly after watching, and asked his henchman next to him. The henchman then took out a loan record.
0:53:48|0:53:56|Boss Zhu took the record sheet filled with characters, sighed, and said.
0:54:18|0:54:25|Outside the casino, three children angrily posted a notice on the wall, with crooked writing that read:
0:54:59|0:55:16|Song Tianyin looked at Huo Xiaolan without saying a word, and the scene shifted to the casino. Tu Sigu, disguised with a wig, was playing mahjong with his invisible companions Benben and Huba. The three people sitting across from him had no idea that Tu Sigu could see all their cards.
0:55:36|0:55:40|At this moment, a tall and obese woman walked over.
0:55:53|0:56:1|[Cui] did not recognize [Tu Sigu] across from her. She nibbled on corn while feeling the cards. [Tu Sigu] looked at [Cui], whose face was covered with corn kernels, with disdain.
0:56:2|0:56:9|Tu Sigu showed no sign of disgust at all. It kept looking at the fragrant corn, licking its lips and making a sound.
0:56:19|0:56:27|After a sudden realization, [Song Tianyin] helped [Huo Xiaolan] onto the bed. Thinking that [Huo Xiaolan] was sick, [Song Tianyin] placed a damp towel on her forehead.
0:56:30|0:56:36|Tu Sigu, who hasn't won a hand in half a day, coughs twice to remind Benben.
0:56:36|0:56:45|After receiving the signal, Tu Sigu moved Huo Xiaolan to the other side to continue playing cards. Coincidentally, Xiao Cui sneezed in Tu Sigu's direction after brewing for a long time.
0:56:46|0:56:51|The corn kernel in Xiaocui's mouth sprayed all over [Tu Sigu] when she sneezed.
0:56:51|0:56:58|With Hu Ba's loud shout, Tu Sigu quickly dodged, accidentally pulling off half of the fake beard stuck on him. Tu Sigu hurriedly made up a lie, saying,
0:57:8|0:57:13|As Xiaocui stood up, she grabbed [Tu Sigu] and pulled him in front of her, then yanked off his fake nose.
0:57:31|0:57:39|Clumsy Tu Sigu jumped from the second floor holding Hu Ba, and rolled to the front of the bronze mirror where Hu Ba screamed.
0:57:47|0:57:54|[Tu Sigu] immediately pulled off his beard and ran towards the gate, but when he rushed out, he saw more thugs ahead, so he had to run towards the eaves on the side.
0:58:6|0:58:14|Beng Beng, facing the pursuers, kicked down two people and struggled to climb onto the roof. In front, Tu Sigu easily reached the neighboring roof through the wooden planks between the two sides.
0:58:17|0:58:23|Tu Sigu was soon caught up by the pursuers, and he cleverly jumped over and kicked off the wooden board. The thugs without the board couldn't dodge in time and fell off the roof.
0:58:23|0:58:26|Running towards the car after shaking off the thugs.
0:58:32|0:58:36|When they were about to catch Tu Sigu, the two teams coincidentally met and collided with each other.
0:58:36|0:58:42|Tu Sigu, who got the opportunity, hurried out of the alley. After looking at the crowded street, he decisively chose the theater behind him.
0:58:42|0:58:51|After lifting the door curtain and taking a look around with Tu Sigu, they sneaked in together. At this moment, the belated thugs looked at the crowded street and lost their direction.
0:59:9|0:59:12|[Tu Sigu] saw a few thugs looking for him at the door through a crack.
0:59:12|0:59:21|So he had a sudden inspiration and secretly took the paint on the table to smear in the corner, Hu Ba and Benben also curiously gathered around.
0:59:22|0:59:31|Before long, the theater was brightly lit and decorated, with various performances entertaining the guests. The audience kept applauding and cheering for the acts on stage.
1:0:23|1:0:30|The burly man swung down his hammer, but the large stone on [Tu Sigu]'s chest remained intact. Seeing this awkward situation, [Tu Sigu] muttered quietly.
1:0:37|1:0:43|After the rock split, another heavy hammer smashed into Tu Sigu's chest, and the strong man looked at Tu Sigu spitting blood from his mouth.
1:0:52|1:0:59|Shortly after [Tu Sigu] was helped to the audience and saluted unsteadily, who knew that [Tu Sigu], who had just stepped off the stage, was pulled back up.
1:1:4|1:1:7|Before [Tu Sigu] could speak, he was pushed into a wooden box.
1:1:7|1:1:15|The wooden box was placed on the stage, after the burly man showed off the sword to the audience, his partner opened the top of the wooden box.
1:1:29|1:1:35|Sigu thrusts the sword down from the wooden box.
1:1:37|1:1:46|Soon the wooden box was filled with swords.
1:1:47|1:1:54|At this moment, [Huo Xiaolan] on the side looked on with worry as the lying [Tu Sigu] spoke to the burly man.
1:2:12|1:2:20|The audience held their breath, watching nervously as the saw blade slowly descended. As the saw blade finally dropped completely, [Tu Sigu] also closed his eyes.
1:2:21|1:2:27|[Huo Ba] watched this scene and cried heartbreakingly.
1:2:28|1:2:34|The audience who were cheering just now quieted down, and the strong man slowly moved the wooden box that had been cut in half at the waist.
1:2:34|1:2:38|Swinging his arms in the middle, indicating to the audience that there is no connection.
1:2:38|1:2:46|Little [Huo Xiaolan] cried even harder after watching, then the strong man slowly closed the broken wooden box.
1:2:46|1:3:5|Seeing [Huo Xiaolan] cry more and more sadly, the clumsy An comforted her by saying, "That's not real." At this moment, the strong man opened the box, and inside the box, [Tu Sigu] woke up unharmed. The audience, which had been silent just now, burst into thunderous applause.
1:3:5|1:3:10|Tu Sigu, with a bewildered look on his face, was helped up and then walked off the stage to show the audience.
1:3:10|1:3:16|Tu Sigu, exhausted, takes off the tiger costume in the dressing room and casually throws the tiger gloves behind him.
1:3:16|1:3:24|This is Bubu turning towards Tu Sigu, who is sobbing in his arms.
1:3:24|1:3:31|Dad [Hu Ba] saw [Tu Sigu], who was still alive, and joyfully pounced on him, rubbing against him repeatedly.
1:3:34|1:3:41|[Tu Sigu] placed [Huo Ba] on the ground and looked at this little monster who was crying uncontrollably because of him, feeling a slight ripple in his heart at that moment.
1:3:42|1:3:49|Tu Sigu watched Huo Xiaolan jumping around as if watching his own child.
1:3:49|1:3:57|Even the silly Benshan showed a relieved smile on the side, the extremely joyful [Huo Ba] bounced out of the door, and [Tu Sigu] followed closely behind after seeing it.
1:3:57|1:4:5|Halfway through, seeing her own appearance, she casually picked up a blanket and draped it over herself. [Huo Xiaolan] had just stepped out the door when she heard the voices of several children not far away.
1:4:12|1:4:21|Upon hearing this, the children all ran towards [Huo Xiaolan]. Just as [Tu Sigu] was about to help, the thugs happened to arrive at the door.
1:4:26|1:4:32|[Huo Xiaolan], standing on the pillar in confusion, agilely jumps onto the back of the clumsy after seeing it waving at her.
1:4:34|1:4:49|As the three of them gathered, a new round of escape began. [Tu Sigu], who ran out of the alley first, happened to look up and noticed the hot air balloon suspended in the air, while on the other side, [Boss Zhu], determined to find [Huo Xiaolan], was packing his luggage.
1:6:0|1:6:5|Angry [Huo Xiaolan] pushed away [Song Tianyin] and stormed out of the door.
1:6:5|1:6:14|Realizing that he had said the wrong thing, [Song Tianyin] slapped himself on the mouth. Angry in the middle of the night, [Huo Xiaolan] walked for a while, then suddenly turned around to see that [Song Tianyin] had not caught up.
1:6:14|1:6:20|[Huo Xiaolan] sighed and sat down dejectedly on a withered tree nearby. After sitting down, [Huo Xiaolan] released the paper figure that had been hanging at her waist.
1:6:20|1:6:27|The paper figures popped out one by one, and [Huo Xiaolan] asked them with a hint of confusion.
1:6:56|1:7:8|The paper dolls covered their faces in fear after hearing it. [Huo Xiaolan] left, and [Song Tianyin] walked out of the room alone. Lost in thought, he leaned on the railing, pondering [Huo Xiaolan]'s words and remembering the mother and child Thorny Demons in the cage.
1:7:10|1:7:17|After a moment of contemplation, [Song Tianyin] looked up, and at that moment, his belief that humans and demons could not coexist was also shaken.
1:7:17|1:7:25|In the late night, on the hot air balloon, Huba was sleeping in the arms of [Tu Sigu]. [Tu Sigu] wiped the drool from Huba's mouth and said,
1:7:42|1:7:47|Tu Sigu listened in silence, furrowing his brow, then comfortingly patted the little [Huo Ba] lying in his arms.
1:7:48|1:7:56|The thugs passing under the hot air balloon were still searching desperately, and Tu Sigu, who stuck his head out, looked at the thugs helplessly.
1:7:56|1:8:5|After speaking, Tu Sigu leaned back and covered the two sleeping figures with a blanket.
1:8:5|1:8:16|Later, [Tu Sigu] also leaned on the shoulder and fell asleep, while [Tu Sigu], who was not asleep, slowly opened his eyes and looked at the silly person beside him. Finally, he shared some of the blanket with the silly person before falling asleep peacefully.
1:8:16|1:8:20|In the darkness of the night, [Tu Sigu] and [Huo Ba] snuggled up together, sleeping peacefully.
1:8:20|1:8:29|After a night of rushing around, they quickly entered the realm of dreams. As the hot air balloon moved slowly, the sleeping Tu Sigu, Huo Xiaolan, and Song Tianyin looked like a family, very warm and cozy.
1:8:29|1:8:35|At the same time, the words of [Huo Xiaolan] kept lingering in [Song Tianyin]'s mind. Unable to fall asleep, [Song Tianyin] wrapped in a blanket and walked into the Demon-Seeking Pavilion.
1:8:38|1:8:44|After experiencing the magic of the Sands of Time during the day, the whimsical Song Tianyin paced back and forth around the disc. Eventually, he sat down on it.
1:8:44|1:8:56|After a moment, the disc descended and the Sandworm was activated. Just like during the day, as the disc descended, a large amount of fine sand was spit out from the dragon's mouth directly ahead.
1:8:56|1:9:3|The same fine sand rose into the air in succession, just as [Song Tianyin] watched with anticipation.
1:9:3|1:9:18|The fine sand failed to transform into any shape and suddenly collapsed, scattering back into the sand pool. Watching the scattered grains of sand, [Song Tianyin], who seemed to know where the problem lay, took a deep breath, closed his eyes, adjusted his sitting posture, and tightly clenched his hands with a furrowed brow, as if his whole body was exerting itself in deep contemplation.
1:9:19|1:9:26|The feeling of longing awakened the Memory Dune once again, as the fine sand slowly rose into the air and gradually intertwined.
1:9:26|1:9:36|In the blink of an eye, the outline of Hu Ba appeared, but just as [Song Tianyin] watched the sand continue to change, the sand scattered back into the sand pool.
1:9:36|1:9:44|Continuously failing, [Song Tianyin] sat dejectedly on the round platform. Hearing footsteps, [Song Tianyin] turned around and saw [Huo Xiaolan] appearing behind him.
1:9:46|1:9:54|[Huo Xiaolan] reached out her hand to [Song Tianyin], and [Song Tianyin] walked over holding the doll made by [Huo Xiaolan] that looked like a Hu Ba, and held his hand.
1:9:54|1:9:57|The two of them smiled at each other with their eyes meeting.
1:9:57|1:10:0|[Huo Xiaolan] looked at the doll in her hand and pondered for a moment before saying to [Song Tianyin].
1:10:2|1:10:4|After speaking, [Song Tianyin] glanced to the side.
1:10:4|1:10:12|Huo Xiaolan was sitting next to Tu Sigu, leaning against him on the sand dune, both closing their eyes and quietly thinking about what Huba looks like.
1:10:12|1:10:23|At this moment, the swirling sand rising into the air emitted a golden light, illuminating the grand hall in a magnificent golden color. The two slowly opened their eyes upon hearing the movement of the sand, only to see the sand transforming into the appearance of Hu Ba.
1:10:23|1:10:30|Dancing in the air, their movements lifelike, tears in their eyes as they recall the happy times spent with [Huo Xiaolan].
1:10:31|1:10:37|Huo Ba happily spits water towards [Huo Xiaolan], the two of them coax Huo Ba to sleep and amuse him, these memories are vivid in their minds.
1:10:37|1:10:41|Even the small paper man around [Huo Xiaolan]'s waist emerged, quietly watching.
1:10:41|1:10:47|The golden light kept flashing on the faces of the two, and the light reflected in their eyes made the tears even more moving.
1:10:47|1:10:54|While Tu Sigu and Huo Xiaolan were still watching the dance, lost in memories, the sand suddenly scattered and turned into the shape of a hot air balloon.
1:10:54|1:11:3|Huo Xiaolan looked at the familiar hot air balloon.
1:11:5|1:11:13|After learning about the location of Huba, the next morning the two of them set off, but before heading there, they first went to the Demon-capturing Pavilion to retrieve their repaired weapons.
1:11:26|1:11:34|After kissing Song Tianyin, Huo Xiaolan ran inside and saw the host, who had been waiting for a long time, sitting on a wooden cart with his back to her. The host spoke after hearing the noise.
1:12:7|1:12:9|After the innkeeper finished speaking, Tu Sigu pulled down the prepared mechanism.
1:12:13|1:12:22|As the mechanism was triggered, two large cannons hidden behind the door were simultaneously activated, shooting a dense barrage of popcorn into the air, gently falling down like snowflakes.
1:12:22|1:12:27|The romantic gesture, like artificial snowfall, was successfully carried out as planned.
1:12:27|1:12:32|Although [Huo Xiaolan] fell for it, her attention was completely drawn to the popcorn falling in front of her.
1:12:33|1:12:40|When [Huo Xiaolan] was focused on watching, the pavilion owner opened the paper umbrella prepared in advance, everything here was within the pavilion owner's plan.
1:12:40|1:12:47|He approached [Huo Xiaolan] step by step with an umbrella, just about to kiss her, when [Song Tianyin] burst in from the door.
1:12:47|1:12:52|Upon seeing [Song Tianyin], [Huo Xiaolan] quickly got up. The approaching innkeeper also missed, almost falling down.
1:13:19|1:13:27|Next to him, [Song Tianyin] let go of his hand and took out a small bucket that matched the wooden bucket.
1:13:28|1:13:37|The shopkeeper took a wooden barrel and demonstrated to the two by placing a small barrel on top of it.
1:13:58|1:14:1|The two in a hurry to leave quickly dealt with the innkeeper before turning around and running away.
1:14:2|1:14:9|Watching the backs of the two, the innkeeper muttered to himself in confusion.
1:14:9|1:14:12|After bidding farewell to the pavilion master, [Tu Sigu] and [Huo Xiaolan] rushed non-stop towards the hot air balloon in the market.
1:14:15|1:14:19|Upon seeing the hot air balloon in the sky, [Huo Xiaolan] joyfully searched everywhere for a place to board.
1:14:19|1:14:24|Just then, Tu Sigu, who had just woken up, raised his head to observe the tracks of the thugs below.
1:14:24|1:14:30|After looking around and not finding any thugs, [Tu Sigu] woke up Benben and Huba to prepare to leave.
1:14:30|1:14:35|And below, Huo Xiaolan and Song Tianyin were still wandering around without finding a way to go up.
1:14:35|1:14:40|As they looked around, [Tu Sigu] climbed down the stage behind them along the railing.
1:14:42|1:14:45|After passing by each other like that, Benben also climbed down with Huba in his arms.
1:14:45|1:14:53|After coming down, [Tu Sigu] and his group still cautiously peeked out first, looking around, only daring to walk on the street after confirming that there were no thugs around.
1:15:6|1:15:10|Tu Sigu gave a glare to Benben and continued walking towards the small path.
1:15:10|1:15:15|As Huo Xiaolan and Tu Sigu walked past one end of the corridor, Tu Sigu's group sneaked past from the other end.
1:15:17|1:15:24|[Huo Xiaolan] caught a glimpse of a figure on the other side and then pulled [Song Tianyin] over in just a moment.
1:15:26|1:15:33|Huo Xiaolan, feeling a bit disheartened, asked Song Tianyin while glancing at Tu Sigu.
1:15:34|1:15:43|Tu Sigu then put Huba in his arms on the ground. Huba, who came down, shyly ran behind a pillar in the corner. It seemed that Huba, who had been holding his urine all night, took a long time to pee.
1:15:43|1:15:50|To wait for Huba, Benben and [Tu Sigu] sat wearily on the chairs, when [Huo Xiaolan] and [Song Tianyin] walked towards them.
1:15:50|1:15:59|The pillar in the corner blocked Hu Ba perfectly, so he didn't notice Hu Ba, but [Huo Xiaolan] looked at [Tu Sigu]'s face with a sense of familiarity, then walked past without paying much attention.
1:15:59|1:16:5|Tu Sigu and his group walked out just after passing by Huba, then they headed in the opposite direction of Huo Xiaolan.
1:16:5|1:16:10|The two groups of people passed each other once again, heading in opposite directions on the deserted street.
1:16:11|1:16:20|As they walked, Tu Sigu and [Huo Xiaolan] suddenly stopped in unison, as if they had a telepathic connection or their hearts were resonating with each other, and they both turned around at the same time.
1:16:23|1:16:28|Seeing their long-lost loved ones within reach, they both joyfully ran towards each other.
1:16:28|1:16:32|Hu Ba excitedly jumped on the two of them, coquettishly.
1:16:33|1:16:40|After enduring countless hardships and longing day and night, the family finally reunited. [Song Tianyin]'s eyes were filled with tears of excitement.
1:16:40|1:16:48|Huo Xiaolan in his arms stopped frolicking at this moment, and instead a mixture of longing and grievance surged in his heart.
1:16:48|1:16:57|[Song Tianyin] couldn't hold back the tears in his eyes as he watched Huba cry uncontrollably.
1:16:58|1:17:4|Beng Beng couldn't help but shed tears as he watched this touching scene.
1:17:7|1:17:14|[Huo Xiaolan] took Huba and held it tightly in her arms, blaming herself.
1:17:31|1:17:36|Just as the family was enjoying the joy of reunion, [Tu Sigu] rushed over and snatched Huba away.
1:17:36|1:17:44|Seeing Huba being snatched away, the couple [Huo Xiaolan] hurried forward to fight for it. Little Huba was passed back and forth between [Tu Sigu] and Benben like a ball.
1:18:43|1:18:49|After hesitating for a moment, Tu Sigu looked at the Hu Ba in his hand and agreed without hesitation.
1:18:54|1:19:0|Tu Sigu then carried Huba and followed Huo Xiaolan and her husband, along with the casino thugs, all the way to the Tian Shi Tang.
1:19:0|1:19:9|A group of people waited in the main hall of the Celestial Master's Palace. Under the leadership of [Yun Qing], all the celestial masters of the Celestial Master's Palace rushed to the main hall after hearing that Huba had been captured.
1:19:9|1:19:16|Yun Qing appeared in a new outfit, wearing a cloak over his shoulders and armor, with two terrifying belts crisscrossing and piercing through his chest.
1:19:16|1:19:22|[Yun Qing], who exudes an evil aura all over his body, walked up to [Tu Sigu], who was holding Huba, and asked.
1:19:29|1:19:33|Yun Qing nodded after listening to the instructions from his subordinates.
1:19:35|1:19:42|Two boxes of silver ingots were brought out and placed in front of [Tu Sigu] by his men.
1:19:42|1:19:46|When the box was opened in front of him, it revealed neatly arranged shining silver ingots.
1:19:46|1:19:49|Tu Sigu looked at Huba in his arms after watching the front.
1:19:49|1:19:55|After watching for a while, [Tu Sigu] finally handed Huba over to [Yun Qing], leaving Benben sighing sadly.
1:19:56|1:19:58|[Tu Sigu] picked up the box and walked towards the door.
1:20:8|1:20:16|He looked at the lost Benben with some astonishment.
1:20:16|1:20:25|Although carrying a heavy burden, [Tu Sigu] still hoped that [Tu Sigu] would persuade her to stay, but she didn't expect [Tu Sigu] to remain silent for a long time before speaking to her.
1:20:30|1:20:36|With that, [Tu Sigu] left amidst the sighs of the crowd.
1:20:36|1:20:43|As Bem Bem turned around tearfully to watch Tu Sigu walk away, Huo Xiaolan gratefully said to Yun Qing.
1:20:52|1:21:0|[Huo Xiaolan] was knocked down by a single palm strike.
1:21:3|1:21:10|The couple [Huo Xiaolan] who were about to get up and chase were surrounded by [Yun Qing]'s men. Several of them quickly formed a circle with their hands and threw specially made wooden sticks at their feet.
1:21:10|1:21:17|A thick smoke enveloped the three of them in an instant, and when the smoke cleared, they were nowhere to be seen. [Song Tianyin] hurriedly said to [Huo Xiaolan].
1:21:26|1:21:30|At this moment, [Tu Sigu] was walking on the street with money in hand.
1:21:33|1:21:37|After learning this news, the three children who had previously posted the notice also came aggressively to demand payment.
1:21:39|1:21:50|The three children happily walked away after receiving the three silver ingots given by [Tu Sigu].
1:21:50|1:21:54|After [Tu Sigu] repaid all the money owed to the people, he leaned against the car in a daze.
1:21:55|1:22:2|After a deep sigh, [Tu Sigu] picked up the remaining silver ingots in the box and pondered.
1:22:14|1:22:23|On the other side, [Yun Qing] led Huba into the cave. Suddenly, Huba farted, and [Yun Qing] grabbed the grass on his head and asked.
1:22:35|1:22:40|Huo Xiaolan couldn't hold it in and peed all over Yun Qing.
1:22:48|1:23:3|On the other side in the demon realm, the couple [Huo Xiaolan] sat on a wooden cart borrowed from the innkeeper, with Benben pulling the cart frantically ahead. The two of them closed their eyes tightly as they raced along the rugged mountain road.
1:23:3|1:23:14|The master of the Tian Shi Tang was eating popcorn alone.
1:23:17|1:23:21|The innkeeper, who had already fallen deeply in love, looked at the sky full of popcorn and talked to the doll.
1:23:23|1:23:31|On the other side, after a period of rushing around, Benben led the two to a cave in the mountains, where [Yun Qing] was washing clothes.
1:23:31|1:23:39|After washing a few times and smelling it, he found that there was still a smell, so he continued to scrub. After repeating this several times, he angrily said to [Huo Xiaolan] next to him.
1:23:48|1:23:56|This is the entrance to the demon realm. After leading the way through the narrow passage, Tu Sigu arrived at an open space and saw [Huo Xiaolan].
1:25:1|1:25:17|While [Huo Xiaolan] was still in the air, the clumsy Benben grabbed [Huo Xiaolan] from the side, only to be forcefully pulled and slammed against the wall. As [Yun Qing] smugly looked at [Huo Xiaolan], she used a rope to pull herself out of [Yun Qing]'s grasp. Seeing this, [Yun Qing] quickly tightened the rope in her hand, at this moment.
1:25:18|1:25:22|Tianyin is going to untie the rope on [Huo Xiaolan], and Yun Qing swings his arm, causing [Huo Xiaolan] to be lifted up along with the rope.
1:25:22|1:25:30|At this moment, [Song Tianyin] in the middle could only keep jumping. Just as he was about to catch her, [Yun Qing] gave a strong swing, and [Huo Xiaolan] fell heavily on [Song Tianyin].
1:25:30|1:25:38|Huo Xiaolan was then dragged to the ground by Tu Sigu. Yun Qing, seeing the two fall to the ground, led the almost fainting Hu Ba towards the entrance of the demon realm. The two hurriedly followed after seeing this.
1:25:44|1:25:47|When they could run out of the cave, [Yun Qing] was nowhere to be seen.
1:25:48|1:25:52|Just as the few were still puzzled, seven Taoists from the Tian Shi Tang walked out of a small cave nearby.
1:25:52|1:26:1|[Huo Xiaolan] took two steps back in fear, only to see seven people walking calmly towards the two of them. They formed two lines and suddenly struck a pose like monsters.
1:26:14|1:26:19|Just as the monsters were approaching, [Huo Xiaolan] leaped up and fiercely knocked down the leading monster.
1:26:19|1:26:26|[Huo Xiaolan] slid towards the center, buying time for [Song Tianyin] to study the weapon box.
1:26:26|1:26:34|When a monster was about to pounce on Song Tianyin, Boss Zhu quickly pressed down the monster's fairy claw and said, "Don't panic." Startled, Song Tianyin immediately lowered his head to study it.
1:26:34|1:26:43|Just upgraded her magic weapon, [Huo Xiaolan] wielded the magic rope like a divine aid, facing multiple enemies without falling into a disadvantage. Meanwhile, [Song Tianyin] successfully opened the weapon box on the side.
1:26:43|1:26:53|After the paper dolls saw it, they jumped in and put on very mini equipment. On the other side, [Huo Xiaolan], who was still fighting hard, had just kicked away a monster when she was accidentally knocked into a cave by a monster from the side.
1:26:53|1:26:57|Just as the monster was about to attack again, eight small paper figures flew towards it.
1:26:57|1:27:14|The inconspicuous little paper man, empowered by swords and knives, unexpectedly defeated the huge monster, leaving it in a sorry state. After providing the little paper man with a good weapon, [Song Tianyin] was still studying his own weapon. At this moment, Benben was still engaging in a battle of wits with the previous monster, buying time for [Song Tianyin], but progress on [Song Tianyin]'s side seemed to be not going smoothly.
1:27:14|1:27:21|Confused, he fumbled with the weapon switch and hurried out of the cave after [Huo Xiaolan] took care of the last pregnant demon, searching for [Song Tianyin] and Bimbo.
1:27:21|1:27:29|Just as [Song Tianyin], who had just finished studying the weapons, met up with [Huo Xiaolan] and Bem Bem, a dozen powerful blood demons flew in from the sky.
1:27:30|1:27:38|[Huo Xiaolan] quickly jumped down from the edge of the cliff below, followed closely by Tu Sigu. Song Tianyin, who was a bit slow, also jumped down at the last moment with his weapon.
1:27:46|1:27:55|One by one, the blood demons piled up like a stack of Arhats, and in the blink of an eye, about ten of them were pressed into the shape of a small mountain peak. After a moment, there was no movement.
1:27:58|1:28:1|Tu Sigu cautiously opened a gap with his four wings and peered through, only to see a smiling talisman flying in and sticking on its forehead.
1:28:1|1:28:9|As it laughed heartily while clutching its stomach, the blood demons that had just piled up like mountains were being bounced off one by one, only to see the [Huo Xiaolan] couple standing up with weapons in their arms.
1:28:10|1:28:13|A large number of blood demons rushed towards them at this moment.
1:28:13|1:28:20|The two of them, Tu Sigu and Huo Xiaolan, back to back without time to speak, shot a large number of talismans at the blood demons in all directions. When an itching talisman hit the demon's forehead, the demon went crazy scratching its whole body.
1:28:22|1:28:27|Completely ignoring the attacks from the two, they swiftly changed directions and accurately shot towards the blood demon in the air.
1:28:27|1:28:35|Tu Sigu caused them to fall in place, while those affected by the laughter spell started laughing heartily in the air.
1:28:43|1:28:48|Seeing the situation turning bad, [Yun Qing] mounted the huge four-winged demon to escape.
1:28:51|1:28:54|The two of them chased after the blood demon while shooting talismans along the way.
1:28:54|1:29:1|Song Tianyin was about to chase after Yun Qing when he prepared to drive towards her, but just as he aimed the launcher, he was whipped to the ground.
1:29:1|1:29:5|At this moment, [Huo Xiaolan] was jumping on the back of a blood demon with a rope, tying up the legs of [Yun Qing]'s mount.
1:29:5|1:29:10|The massive mount was not greatly affected by this, but instead dragged [Huo Xiaolan] forward and flew away.
1:29:15|1:29:18|After that, [Song Tianyin] and [Tu Sigu] quickly jumped up from the nearby high ground.
1:29:18|1:29:25|Even so, it did not affect the speed of the mounts flying, dragging them between the towering cliffs.
1:29:25|1:29:32|Seeing that they couldn't shake off the pursuers, the mount suddenly flew vertically into the air, continued flying for dozens of meters, then suddenly changed direction and flew straight down.
1:29:34|1:29:44|[Song Tianyin], who was in danger himself, shouted at [Boss Zhu]. With lightning speed, he blew [Boss Zhu]'s mouth out of shape.
1:29:44|1:29:53|Just as they were about to land, [Yun Qing] suddenly pulled the rope on the neck of the mount and went into a level flight again. Seeing that they hadn't shaken off their pursuers yet, they flew towards a narrow valley.
1:29:53|1:29:56|The back and forth shaking caused [Song Tianyin] to accidentally drop the sword.
1:29:56|1:30:3|Fortunately, Tu Sigu reacted quickly behind and grabbed the sword with his foot, then he played with it in a smug manner.
1:30:6|1:30:12|But accidentally the sword fell into the abyss of ten thousand feet deep, as they were about to pass by a mountain peak, Benben quickly grabbed onto the mountain.
1:30:12|1:30:16|[Huo Xiaolan] also quickly loosened the rope, thus ending a forced flight.
1:30:16|1:30:19|At this moment, [Yun Qing] slipped and Huba fell into the abyss.
1:30:20|1:30:27|Under the pull of the law rope, Yongqing's human skin was also torn off, revealing his monster true form. Unexpectedly, he turned out to be the Red Sky Tyrant sent by the Demon King.
1:30:27|1:30:35|The furious Chi Tianba pushed his mount towards the peak where [Huo Xiaolan] was located. As the peak shook violently, several people couldn't stand firm and fell off the cliff together.
1:30:45|1:30:50|Facing the terrifying Chi Tianba, [Huo Xiaolan] bravely took out the law rope, just as she finished speaking.
1:30:51|1:30:57|[Huo Xiaolan] used a rope to tie up Tu Sigu's hands, but the powerful Tu Sigu easily threw [Huo Xiaolan] against the wall with just a lift of his hand.
1:30:57|1:31:1|After kicking Huo Xiaolan again, Tu Sigu was about to launch an attack on the fallen Huo Xiaolan when a spell was uttered.
1:31:3|1:31:24|Song Tianyin used telekinesis to hurl a large rock towards Tu Sigu. At that moment, Huo Xiaolan tried to snatch the tiger skin from behind, but Tu Sigu dodged and Huo Xiaolan fell to the ground. Enraged, Tu Sigu emitted a large amount of poisonous gas from the hole behind him, causing everyone to cover their mouths and noses with their sleeves in a hurry. Just as they were about to faint, a group of little demon wings dispersed the thick fog.
1:31:24|1:31:30|The person who sat on the monster immediately snatched Huba away. When Chi Tianba took a closer look, he realized that the person was [Tu Sigu].
1:31:47|1:31:52|After listening, the little monster hidden in the colored cup crawled under [Tu Sigu], and the monster's head stretched into the mouth.
1:31:52|1:31:58|Tu Sigu jumps down and returns the sword he picked up to Song Tianyin.
1:32:16|1:32:23|Chi Tianba released more poison gas with force.
1:32:23|1:32:28|Tu Sigu, who came up with a solution at this moment, said to the little monster woman.
1:32:30|1:32:38|The flower bud on Tu Sigu's head slowly opened its petals, and Tu Sigu sprinkled the nectar all the way into the hole where Chitian Ba was spewing poisonous gas.
1:32:39|1:32:47|Before the group of people covering their noses could react, a swarm of bees caught the scent and swarmed over.
1:32:48|1:32:56|At this moment, the small paper figures around Xiaolan's waist also jumped out, wielding weapons and riding on bees, landing on Tu Sigu's back like celestial warriors.
1:32:56|1:33:2|Several small paper figures each had their own clear division of labor, drilling into the holes behind [Boss Chi Tian], and soon everyone saw the poison gas slowly dissipating.
1:33:2|1:33:8|Just now the mighty and domineering [Tu Sigu] is now struggling in pain on the ground, despite his large stature.
1:33:8|1:33:12|But faced with such a small creature, there was no way but to let it have its way.
1:33:12|1:33:16|After Bem Bem returned to the group, [Tu Sigu] teased.
1:33:25|1:33:27|The group of people who were about to leave turned back to look when they heard the noise.
1:33:28|1:33:34|Tu Sigu, on the verge of death, crawled to his mount and opened his mouth wide, slowly swallowing it whole.
1:33:34|1:33:38|After swallowing everything, a gas in the body sprayed the paper man and the bees out of the hole.
1:33:39|1:33:42|As the mount was rapidly digested inside, the size of [Chi Tianba] also increased several times compared to before.
1:33:53|1:33:59|At this moment, [Huo Xiaolan] fearlessly walked towards [Tu Sigu], who was seen stuffing small stones along the way into its mouth.
1:34:2|1:34:8|Huo Xiaolan pouted and forcefully spat the pebble in her mouth towards Tu Sigu.
1:34:11|1:34:24|Huo Xiaolan's attack proved ineffective, Tu Sigu quickly stepped forward to carry away Hu Ba, while Song Tianyin brandished his sword and questioned, unwilling to waste words, Chi Tianba raised his hand and struck towards everyone.
1:34:26|1:34:29|Several people, agile in dodging the attacks, were also forced into a corner.
1:34:29|1:34:35|Several people only knew how to avoid, but they didn't realize that in front of them was a cliff. At the edge of the cliff, everyone looked fearfully at Tu Sigu.
1:34:35|1:34:44|The fist hit the ground heavily, causing the weakest part of the cliff edge to break, and everyone fell down together, with Tu Sigu poking his head out to look down.
1:34:44|1:34:52|Discovering that the group of people did not fall to the bottom of the cliff, but were actually on a ledge below, [Tu Sigu] and the others were all safe and sound, with only the clumsy and overweight Bens falling at the edge of the cliff.
1:34:52|1:34:55|The three of them then worked together to pull Benben up.
1:34:56|1:34:59|Just then, a big hand from Tu Sigu swung over.
1:35:34|1:35:39|Huo Xiaolan instructed Boss Zhu before returning with Song Tianyin and Tu Sigu back to the bottom of the cliff through the small path.
1:35:39|1:35:46|Facing the huge Red Sky Tyrant, Tu Sigu, Huo Xiaolan, Song Tianyin, and Boss Zhu showed no fear this time. Following the plan, the four of them ran towards the four sides of the Red Sky Tyrant.
1:35:46|1:35:53|[Tu Sigu] held Bubu and hid in a cave, waiting for an opportunity. Seeing Chitian Ba chasing after [Boss Zhu], [Huo Xiaolan] used a rope to tie its arms.
1:35:55|1:36:5|On the side, [Song Tianyin] was chanting spells, controlling the sword to constantly interfere. At this moment, [Tu Sigu] ran out and shouted loudly, causing Benben to lie down decisively on the ground.
1:36:8|1:36:16|[Tu Sigu] held Huba, using his clumsy big belly as a springboard, flew in front of Chitianba, who spat on him, feeling insulted. Chitianba attacked everyone in anger.
1:36:16|1:36:28|After knocking down several people with just a few moves, Tu Sigu reached out and grabbed Huo Xiaolan who was standing. When everyone saw Huo Xiaolan being tightly held by Tu Sigu's big hand, they rushed towards Tu Sigu without hesitation.
1:36:29|1:36:34|Tu Sigu and Benben were desperately hitting at the feet of Chi Tianba, but Chi Tianba didn't feel any pain at all.
1:36:36|1:36:41|Desperate to save Hu Ba, [Huo Xiaolan] once again tied Chi Tianba's hands with a rope, prompting [Song Tianyin] to think that the sword could enlarge.
1:36:43|1:36:52|As soon as the spell was cast, [Huo Xiaolan] was thrown towards the cliff.
1:36:54|1:37:0|At this moment, the sword also shrinks to the size of a person. Even when Huo Xiaolan is about to fall, Song Tianyin steps on the flying sword and catches her steadily.
1:37:0|1:37:4|Benny, who was still constantly hitting the Red Sky Tyrant, had [Tu Sigu] caught in his hands.
1:37:4|1:37:18|The couple [Huo Xiaolan] and [Tu Sigu], who were standing on the sword, had just adjusted their positions and were ready to launch an attack when suddenly, a tail from the Red Sky Tyrant caught them off guard and threw them off the ship. Fortunately, [Song Tianyin] was very skilled in his magic, and he used his mind to control the sword and catch the two of them.
1:37:19|1:37:28|The two of them who had just stepped on the sword agilely dodged the palm of Chitian Ba flying towards the cave, and then shouted towards Hu Ba after flying out again.
1:37:40|1:37:47|The sword, under the control of [Song Tianyin], flew straight towards Chitian Ba's head, and just before impact, Huba stopped yelling.
1:37:47|1:37:54|Huo Xiaolan, who could be seen, hurriedly jumped to the side with Song Tianyin. But before he could react, the ruthless Tu Sigu was pierced through the head by a swiftly approaching sword.
1:37:54|1:37:57|Later, Benben and [Tu Sigu] were also thrown to the ground.
1:37:57|1:38:3|The crowd just realized what was happening, and they saw the massive Red Sky Tyrant slowly moving towards Hu Ba.
1:38:5|1:38:13|At the critical moment, [Huo Xiaolan] throws the rope towards Hu Ba.
1:38:13|1:38:20|When they retrieved it, Tu Sigu collapsed to the ground in despair without seeing Huba's trace.
1:38:21|1:38:30|Everyone thought that Huba would always fall under the body of Chitian Ba, but at this moment, there was a connection between [Song Tianyin] and the sword.
1:38:30|1:38:49|Huo Xiaolan sat on the sword, flew back to everyone with a happy face, and was quickly embraced by Song Tianyin.
1:38:49|1:38:59|Huba once again leaned against [Huo Xiaolan] in her arms, as the sun gradually set, and the group of people arrived in front of the body of Chitianba.
1:38:59|1:39:8|The crowd did not celebrate happily as they looked at its body, but fell silent collectively for a long time. After a while, [Song Tianyin] found the skin worn by the Red Sky Tyrant.
1:39:8|1:39:12|Stacking it under the sunlight, [Tu Sigu] sighed.
1:40:34|1:40:41|Bengbeng and Huba were both filled with tears, looking at each other, Bengbeng couldn't help but sob a few times.
1:40:44|1:40:57|Huo Xiaolan and her husband then held Huba and prepared to leave, with Huba waving goodbye to Tu Sigu and Benben in the middle. After the Huba family walked away, Benben looked at the tearful Tu Sigu and said,
1:41:12|1:41:18|Recalling the events of today, [Song Tianyin] asked with a hint of confusion.
1:41:37|1:41:45|After a moment of happy playfulness, [Song Tianyin] put his arms around [Huo Xiaolan] and Hu Ba.
1:41:56|1:42:4|Tu Sigu, who lingered, lay on the ground watching the sunset with Xiaolan. Tu Sigu said to Xiaolan.
