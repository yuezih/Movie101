0:0:53|0:0:58|At the beginning of the film, [Brother Cheng]'s son-in-law [Sir Wan] is smoking on the overpass waiting for others.
0:0:58|0:1:5|Before long, the man, along with his wife and daughter, took a taxi to the overpass where they had arranged to meet [Sir Wan] in advance.
0:1:5|0:1:9|After getting off the car, Sir Wan lovingly carried his daughter out and spoke to her tenderly.
0:1:32|0:1:36|As soon as the man turned around, he saw the assassin holding a gun standing not far away.
0:1:36|0:1:38|With a flicker, Sir Wan pulled the trigger.
0:1:41|0:1:44|The shot was precise, hitting the daughter directly.
0:1:44|0:1:48|The man didn't have time to care about his daughter's injuries, so he could only take the opportunity to escape.
0:1:48|0:1:51|After the man climbed over the bushes, he found himself on an empty road.
0:1:51|0:1:55|In this environment, he didn't run far before being shot by the assassin and fell in a pool of blood.
0:1:55|0:2:0|Upon hearing the commotion, [Sir Wan] decisively jumped down from the overpass and pulled out his gun to fight back against the assassins.
0:2:0|0:2:7|The assassin started to flee down a small path upon seeing the situation, with [Sir Wan] closely following his trail and shouting at him:
0:2:9|0:2:12|It's fine if you don't shout, but once you do, you'll be met with the killer's counterattack.
0:2:12|0:2:14|[Sir Wan] saw the situation and already knew in his heart.
0:2:17|0:2:23|So he kept looking for the right moment to shoot, and the gunshots alerted two patrolling police officers.
0:2:35|0:2:41|While the two police officers were talking, the killer had already crossed the highway and ran to an abandoned overpass.
0:2:41|0:2:49|Although there were many fast cars on the highway, it didn't pose a challenge for the experienced [Sir Wan], who quickly caught up with the killer.
0:2:49|0:2:56|On the overpass, as the distance between [Sir Wan] and the assassin grew, just as the assassin was about to succeed, police officers arrived at the other end of the overpass.
0:2:59|0:3:3|The assassin, seeing no way out, fired a shot at the police officer and then jumped off the bridge.
0:3:3|0:3:7|Sir Wan quickly fired his gun, but unfortunately ran out of bullets at a critical moment.
0:3:7|0:3:11|When the assassin jumped off the overpass, he landed right into a garbage truck.
0:3:11|0:3:14|At this moment, the police officer decisively fired his gun and killed the assassin.
0:3:34|0:3:35|Today is [Zu'er]'s birthday.
0:3:44|0:3:49|[Zu'er]'s friend climbed up to the peephole eagerly, but immediately lost interest and said.
0:4:22|0:4:27|[Zu'er] eagerly unwrapped the gift, only to find a pair of headphones, he said disappointedly.
0:4:49|0:4:52|Zu'er is clumsy, said Sir Wan.
0:4:56|0:4:58|Zu'er exclaimed in surprise upon seeing the gift.
0:5:21|0:5:33|The father, after listening, did not continue to respond to the two jokingly. Instead, he changed his smiling face from earlier, picked up the photo next to him, then took out his reading glasses. After carefully looking at it, he said to Zu'er with a worried expression.
0:5:52|0:5:55|[Zu'er] with moist eyes, hugged her father.
0:5:59|0:6:13|At the same time, Zu'er's brother [A Hua] was driving a convertible sports car through the bustling city, purposefully pulling up in front of a well-known jewelry store. He then parked the car on the street and walked into the store without looking back.
0:6:13|0:6:19|The handsome [A Hua] didn't forget to exchange flirtatious glances with the passing beauties, attracting the attention of the nearby traffic police as well.
0:6:28|0:6:33|Shortly after, [A Hua] took the ticket and politely thanked the police officer.
0:6:33|0:6:37|Sir Wan jumped into the convertible car gracefully and drove towards home.
0:6:37|0:6:40|At the same time, [Sir Wan] walked out with a cake.
0:6:54|0:7:0|[Zu'er] made a wish and then blew out the candle with a whip.
0:7:0|0:7:3|Zu'er's friend grabbed the cake directly and stuffed it into his mouth.
0:7:50|0:8:7|[Sir Wan] said, then got up to open the door for [A Hua]. The two greeted each other briefly. When [Da Sha] saw [A Hua], he also got up happily to greet him.
0:8:18|0:8:21|While speaking, she put the pearl necklace around [Da Sha]'s neck.
0:8:23|0:8:28|After the birthday party, father and [A Hua] talked in the basement.
0:8:53|0:8:57|After that, [A Hua] started up his convertible sports car.
0:8:57|0:9:6|The next day, the [Colleagues] at the police station were demonstrating how to interrogate.
0:9:16|0:9:18|This is when the policewoman caught a group of dancers.
0:9:42|0:9:55|Sir Wan, the cock-eyed policeman, was about to make a move when he was unexpectedly kicked to the ground by a woman. She even shoved a half-eaten popsicle into his mouth, and then efficiently knocked down all the approaching policemen.
0:10:11|0:10:20|The police chief called [Sir Wan] and the woman into the office. The woman had a smug look on her face, while [Sir Wan] was very unhappy with her behavior.
0:10:20|0:10:22|At this moment, the leader introduced the two of them.
0:10:22|0:10:23|Sir Wan reluctantly shook hands with him.
0:10:54|0:10:58|Tan Ling said, and then placed the prepared file bag on the table.
0:10:58|0:11:3|Wang Yongqiang took the file bag and glanced at the name of the investigation company before saying to the leader.
0:11:30|0:11:34|Shortly after, [Sir Wan] and [Zu'er] drove to the company entrance to collect evidence.
0:12:20|0:12:25|As soon as Wang Yongqiang finished speaking, a rather ostentatious luxury car slowly pulled up in front of the building.
0:12:25|0:12:32|After the car came to a stop, the younger brother in the passenger seat got out first, then opened the door for the boss [Da Sha] sitting in the back.
0:12:34|0:12:43|[Sir Wan] quickly hid himself by lying on Tan Lin's legs when he saw [Da Sha].
0:12:43|0:12:50|And at that moment, [Zu'er] saw this scene, he angrily threw things into the car and walked away.
0:12:50|0:12:53|Sir Wan quickly climbed out of the skylight to explain when he saw Zu'er.
0:12:57|0:13:3|In response to Sir Wan's call, Zu'er didn't stop at all, but instead walked faster in a trend of anger.
0:13:39|0:13:43|After Sir Wan left the Red Robe Group, Da Sha also led his little brother into the building.
0:13:43|0:13:47|Shortly after, the drug smuggler also arrived at [Da Sha]'s office.
0:13:47|0:13:53|Boss Cao, dressed in a suit and sunglasses, politely clasped his hands together and slightly bowed to [Da Sha] as a sign of respect.
0:13:53|0:13:56|Da Sha said nothing, just gestured for him to sit down.
0:13:56|0:14:1|Boss Cao's henchman on the side took out a sample prepared in advance and threw it in front of [Da Sha].
0:14:1|0:14:5|A Hua, standing aside, took the drugs and tasted it, then nodded towards Da Sha.
0:14:8|0:14:14|Da Sha turned his head to look at A Hua, who walked up to Boss Cao with a smile on his face.
0:15:6|0:15:22|On the other side, [Zu'er], a gymnastics coach, dressed in a tight gymnastics suit, is watching the students training in the classroom attentively. Some are practicing on the rings, some on the parallel bars. However, [Sir Wan] notices that two students are sitting in the corner, so he walks over and asks.
0:15:28|0:15:31|[Zu'er] turned to look at the young man outside the door.
0:15:50|0:15:58|Zu'er's father, Brother Cheng, happened to witness the scene where the boy fell down.
0:17:6|0:17:10|Father let out a sigh, then pinched his brow with a worried expression on his face.
0:17:41|0:17:52|At the same time, outside the building, after disguising herself, Tan Ling obtained some information about the company in the building, and rushed to report to [Sir Wan], who also bought his favorite ice cream waiting for him.
0:18:43|0:18:50|After discussing, Tan Ling disguised herself as Miss Wu, a wealthy woman, and successfully approached [A Hua]'s company with a large sum of money.
0:18:50|0:18:54|A Hua was also shocked when he saw the amount that Tan Ling wanted to handle, and he said.
0:19:56|0:20:4|After Tan Ling almost walked past the person next to her, she continued to collect evidence in the company, while [A Hua] immediately went to find [Da Sha], who had just rudely intruded, to inquire about the situation.
0:20:4|0:20:10|At this moment, only Sir Wan is left in the office, she keeps searching on the desk, but finds nothing of value.
0:20:10|0:20:16|She picked up the photo of [A Hua] and her sister casually, just as [A Hua] walked in.
0:20:39|0:20:45|Shortly after, [Sir Wan] and [Zu'er] arrived at a western restaurant downstairs from the company. The two of them had a pleasant conversation while dining.
0:20:45|0:20:48|When the meal was almost finished, Tan Ling excused herself to go to the restroom and reported the situation.
0:20:51|0:20:55|And at this moment, it was [Zu'er] who had come to find [A Hua] that witnessed it.
0:20:55|0:21:0|Zu'er sat down at the dining table and greeted her brother as soon as Tan Ling left.
0:21:8|0:21:14|[A Hua] took the application form from the community center and looked at it carefully, while Zu'er asked eagerly.
0:21:35|0:21:40|The waiter accidentally knocked over A Hua's pen while clearing the dishes.
0:21:40|0:21:53|Zu'er suddenly remembered and said after picking up the pen.
0:21:53|0:21:58|Upon hearing this, [A Hua] suddenly panicked, quickly signed the document, and sent Zu'er away.
0:22:1|0:22:8|After Zu'er left, A Hua's eyes suddenly turned fierce, then he took out his phone to arrange a plan with Da Sha and his men.
0:22:8|0:22:14|And at this moment, Tan Ling, who was reporting to Sir Wan in the restroom, was still unaware that danger had quietly arrived.
0:22:14|0:22:18|Upon learning about Tan Ling's identity, [A Hua] did not expose her, but proceeded with the process as usual.
0:22:38|0:22:46|[A Hua] directly played along with the plan and brought him directly to the drug trafficking den, soon arriving at the shipping yard. The little brother in charge of the barges hurriedly came forward.
0:22:47|0:22:56|After A Hua got off the car, his younger brother quickly parked the car. A Hua then went to Tan Long's side to show him the way, and the two of them walked towards the ferry, one in front and one behind.
0:22:56|0:23:3|The two climbed up the escalator and arrived at the ship's bridge, where they could see the entire view of the shipyard at a glance.
0:23:17|0:23:27|As soon as Sir Wan heard this, he immediately became flustered. After a moment, he cleverly responded.
0:23:27|0:23:43|Upon realizing his identity had been exposed, [Tan Lin] instinctively retreated towards the cabin door, with [A Hua] also wearing a serious expression as he closed in step by step. Looking outside, [Tan Lin] saw several thugs approaching from all directions, but as an international police officer, [Tan Lin] naturally wouldn't just sit back and do nothing, facing the towering and burly thugs.
0:23:43|0:23:48|He easily dealt with it, but more and more thugs arrived, and [Tan Lin] had to fight and retreat.
0:23:48|0:23:51|[A Hua] saw that his men were no match for [Tan Lin], so he personally took action.
0:23:51|0:23:58|[A Hua], who appears to be gentle and refined on the surface, is decisive in his actions. With just a few moves, he knocks down the police officer [Tan Lin] to the ground.
0:23:58|0:24:6|At this moment, the thugs took advantage of the situation and rushed in. [Tan Lin] saw this, did a carp stand up from the ground, then knocked down the thugs with two punches, and ran towards the top of the boat.
0:24:6|0:24:10|The thugs hurried to chase, and soon, five or six thugs gathered on the narrow deck of the boat.
0:24:11|0:24:24|Bare-handed [Tan Ling] was unable to break through and was soon injured by the thugs. However, [Tan Ling] did not give up easily, vowing to fight the criminals to the end. But at this moment, [Tan Ling] was already at the end of her strength, with both physical and endurance reaching their limits.
0:24:24|0:24:40|At this moment, [A Hua] slowly climbed up from the ladder, he saw [Tan Ling] fighting with the thugs but did not intervene. It wasn't until [Tan Lin] was knocked down that he walked over, grabbed [Tan Lin], and shouted at her mercilessly before delivering a powerful punch, leaving the exhausted [Tan Lin] completely unable to resist.
0:24:40|0:24:57|Shortly after, he picked up the nearby rope, looped it around Tan Lin's neck, and then kicked Tan Lin off the deck. As Tan Lin was halfway falling, [A Hua] suddenly stepped on the rope. And so, a brave and skilled international female detective sacrificed her precious life. That night, [Sir Wan] expressed his confusion.
0:25:34|0:25:40|[Sir Wan] nodded, walked towards the leader's office, and knocked on the door with determination.
0:26:19|0:26:28|[Sir Wan] walked out of the office with a grimy face after being scolded by the leader, while at the same time, [Zu'er] led the people from the community to visit the ship.
0:26:57|0:27:2|The teacher led the group out of the lounge, but two students secretly hid themselves, wanting to continue the tour.
0:27:16|0:27:26|After taking photos, they continued to tour the boat. Meanwhile, disregarding their family relationship, Sir Wan angrily stormed into A Hua's office.
0:27:26|0:27:32|[A Hua] saw [Sir Wan] approaching and, knowing the reason, [Sir Wan] took out a photo of Tan Lin and asked.
0:28:34|0:28:38|[A Hua]'s seamless acting successfully deceived [Sir Wan].
0:28:38|0:28:40|After he came out of the building, his subordinates eagerly asked.
0:28:46|0:28:47|Confirmed that the two of them had dinner together before.
0:28:49|0:28:52|Sir Wan and the others left the building and went to another place.
0:28:52|0:28:57|In the afternoon, after the students finished visiting the shipyard, they returned to the classroom and continued their training.
0:28:57|0:29:0|At this moment, male classmate Huang Zhiqiang handed the washed photos to [Zu'er].
0:29:7|0:29:12|After the community event in the afternoon, [Zu'er] returned home with documents and photos.
0:29:12|0:29:21|As soon as the door was pushed open, [Zu'er] was choked by the smoke in the room. He looked into the living room and found [Sir Wan] sitting alone in the corner, smoking, with documents scattered all over the floor.
0:29:21|0:29:26|Zu'er, seeing the situation, quickly put down what was in her hands and approached Sir Wan.
0:29:37|0:29:41|[Sir Wan] listlessly extinguished the cigarette and said to [Zu'er] in great frustration.
0:29:46|0:29:53|[Zu'er] picked up the information about Tan Ling on the ground, looked at the photo on it, and said to [Sir Wan].
0:30:2|0:30:6|[Zu'er], after being splashed with cold water by [Sir Wan], helplessly got up and left.
0:30:6|0:30:12|[Sir Wan] still looked dejected, staring at the documents in his hand, constantly pondering where Tang Ling might have gone.
0:30:12|0:30:19|After a while, [Zu'er] finished showering and found [Sir Wan] still in the living room, smoking with a listless look on his face.
0:30:19|0:30:23|Zu'er couldn't help but worry about Sir Wan's health after watching, so she walked over and said.
0:30:23|0:30:28|Honey, you go take a shower first. [Sir Wan] impatiently writes the report without saying a word.
0:30:37|0:30:42|[Sir Wan] once again poured cold water on [Zu'er]'s concern, making [Zu'er] angrily walk towards the bedroom.
0:30:42|0:30:51|[Sir Wan] looked at the back of [Zu'er] and felt that he had gone too far, but he was tormented by the case and had no extra energy to comfort [Zu'er].
0:30:51|0:30:57|[Zu'er] returned to the room, vigorously threw the towel on the bed, and sat alone on the edge of the bed, sulking.
0:30:57|0:31:3|He was extremely dissatisfied with [Sir Wan]'s attitude, and thinking about [Sir Wan]'s previous intimate contact with Tan Ling, he couldn't help but feel jealous.
0:31:4|0:31:8|At this moment, [Zu'er] suddenly remembered the photos that the students gave her in the afternoon.
0:31:8|0:31:12|Zu'er, with nothing to do, picked up the photos and looked through them one by one.
0:31:12|0:31:18|Flipping through the photos, he suddenly saw that in the group photo of students in front of the cold storage, Tan Ling's body was in the corner.
0:31:18|0:31:22|The next morning, [Zu'er] went to her father's house and found her brother [A Hua].
0:31:22|0:31:24|At this moment, the father and [A Hua] are having breakfast.
0:31:35|0:31:38|Drag A Hua out into the courtyard, said Sir Wan.
0:32:5|0:32:11|[A Hua] was suddenly at a loss for words, but the matter was of great importance, and [Zu'er] urged impatiently.
0:32:11|0:32:29|Later, [A Hua] and [Zu'er] arrived at the shipyard together. [A Hua] opened the door of the ship and let [Zu'er] search freely. Despite searching from the kitchen to the dormitory, [Zu'er] found nothing. He then asked [A Hua] to take him to the cold storage in the cabin to search, unaware that the body had already been moved. [A Hua] calmly opened the door of the cold storage and said.
0:32:34|0:32:38|After searching around, [Zu'er] left the cabin with a mixture of belief and doubt.
0:32:38|0:32:44|He came to the office to call student Huang Zhiqiang, ready to retrieve the film.
0:32:56|0:33:5|A Hua, who heard everything clearly outside the door, immediately picked up the phone after seeing Zu'er leave. He informed his men of the address of Huang Zhiqiang, ready to snatch the film in advance.
0:33:5|0:33:16|In a hurry to go on vacation, Sir Wan wanted to leave early, so he discussed it with his girlfriend at home.
0:33:16|0:33:19|At this moment, the deliveryman who came to pick up the package rang the doorbell.
0:33:22|0:33:25|Saying that, Huang Zhiqiang put the film into an envelope and handed it to the courier.
0:33:25|0:33:33|And his girlfriend, in order to inform [Zu'er] of their whereabouts, wrote a note with the destination and stuck it outside the door.
0:33:33|0:33:36|[Zu'er] drove over in a hurry, but he was still one step too late.
0:33:36|0:33:41|As they crossed the road from the apartment gate, the taxi that [Zu'er] was riding in pulled up downstairs.
0:33:41|0:33:44|Just like that, they passed by each other as if by chance.
0:33:45|0:33:51|Upon getting out of the car, Sol quickly walked into the apartment. At the same time, A Hua's henchmen had already taken the elevator up the building.
0:34:1|0:34:7|Shortly after, the two of them walked towards the elevator entrance, while another henchman took out his phone to call [A Hua] and report the current situation.
0:34:28|0:34:45|At this moment, Sir Wan and his friends also arrived at the vacation house.
0:34:45|0:34:49|And at this moment, [Da Sha] and [A Hua] arrived here with their men.
0:34:49|0:34:51|[Huang Zhiqiang] and his girlfriend pulled back the curtains and saw them.
0:35:6|0:35:18|Just as the group was at a loss, [A Hua] and [Da Sha] had already walked in with their men from the front door, and the boy thought they were the landlord and spoke up.
0:35:46|0:35:56|Da Sha directly threw Huang Diqiang to his subordinates, who lifted Huang Diqiang and rushed into the current tank. [A Hua] asked the girl next to him.
0:35:56|0:35:59|The girl had just shaken her head when she was sent flying by [A Hua].
0:36:8|0:36:12|Da Sha slapped his face with a fierce look.
0:36:12|0:36:16|Da Sha delivered a powerful punch, leaving the boy in excruciating pain, then he looked towards Sir Wan's girlfriend.
0:36:20|0:36:37|Da Sha, after hearing this, looked sharply at A Hua beside him. A Hua furrowed his brows upon hearing it, and after a discussion between the two, they prepared to ask Zu'er for the negatives. Little did they know, Zu'er's taxi had already arrived near the resort. Da Sha pulled out a gun, ready to deal with the five students inside the house, when suddenly,
0:36:49|0:36:53|Tie them all up. Meanwhile, Zu'er is still at the resort, searching for the whereabouts of the group.
0:36:53|0:37:0|Inside the house, [A Hua] thought he would let some students go, but little did they know he was making a bomb with gas and circuits.
0:37:0|0:37:3|After [A Hua] finished making the bomb, he walked towards the outside of the house.
0:37:3|0:37:6|Before long, they encountered a few children playing and frolicking around.
0:37:6|0:37:12|The children felt very scared when they saw a group of adults in suits walking towards them.
0:37:17|0:37:19|A Hua bent down and said in a calm tone.
0:37:24|0:37:26|The little girl and Xiao Ming on the side said.
0:37:50|0:38:6|Indeed, the vacation home is already filled with gas, and once the short-circuited doorbell is touched, it will ignite all the gas, triggering an explosion.
0:38:6|0:38:13|Inside the room, the five students were tied up and unable to move, with their mouths taped shut. They had no way to seek help from the outside world.
0:38:14|0:38:17|Can only squirm desperately, hoping for a miracle to happen.
0:38:17|0:38:22|Before the children returned to the apartment, [Zu'er] had already arrived outside the house.
0:38:22|0:38:30|He lingered outside the house for a long time, feeling that something was amiss. The vacation home, which should have been lively, was now eerily quiet, making [Zu'er] doubt if he had taken a wrong turn.
0:38:32|0:38:49|After confirming the room number was correct, [Zu'er] still pressed the doorbell. With a loud bang, the room was instantly engulfed in flames, and [Zu'er] was thrown several meters away by the shockwave of the explosion, fainting on the roadside. The commotion alarmed nearby residents, and [Zu'er] was then taken to the hospital for emergency treatment.
0:38:49|0:38:58|Upon receiving the news, [Sir Wan] immediately put down his work and rushed to the hospital to take care of [Zu'er]. Although Zu'er's illness was not serious, she was still lying unconscious in the hospital bed.
0:38:58|0:39:1|[Sir Wan] looked at the unconscious [Zu'er], tears welling up in his eyes.
0:39:1|0:39:5|At this moment, [Zu'er]'s father hurriedly arrived at the ward.
0:39:5|0:39:10|Father wanted to ask about the situation, but was afraid of disturbing his daughter's rest, so he didn't ask too much.
0:39:10|0:39:15|At this moment, [Zu'er] slowly opened her eyes and hugged [Sir Wan] with a look of great grievance.
0:39:19|0:39:23|[Sir Wan] gently comforts [Zu'er] as he slowly lays him down on the bed.
0:39:23|0:39:27|After [Zu'er] lay down, she asked with a hint of tears in her voice.
0:39:35|0:39:39|Sir Wan kissed Zu'er on the forehead and Zu'er continued to ask.
0:40:11|0:40:15|Sir Wan affectionately kissed Zu'er's hand before getting up to investigate the case.
0:40:15|0:40:20|As they reached the door, [Sir Wan] couldn't help but remind [Zu'er] anxiously.
0:40:20|0:40:24|After seeing Zu'er nod, Sir Wan led the group back to the resort.
0:40:24|0:40:35|At this moment, Xiao Ming is playing with his friends.
0:40:35|0:40:42|Xiao Ming, realizing the situation, knew he couldn't play anymore, so he quickly ate the ice cream in his hand and climbed out of the dried-up swimming pool.
0:40:47|0:40:54|At this moment, [Sir Wan] happened to pass by, followed by the [colleague] wearing [Wang Yongqiang]'s clothes.
0:41:53|0:42:1|[Sir Wan] then left the resort and rushed back to the police station to have the evidence tested, before heading non-stop to the hospital where [Zu'er] was located.
0:42:1|0:42:9|[Zu'er] was scratched on the face by the fragments of the explosion, her once beautiful face now wrapped in thick bandages, which deeply saddened [Sir Wan].
0:42:9|0:42:14|[Sir Wan] saw that [Zu'er] was still sleeping, so he didn't wake him up, but sat quietly beside him to accompany him.
0:42:18|0:42:25|At this moment, Sir Wan's phone suddenly rang, the ringtone woke up Zu'er.
0:43:4|0:43:9|After hanging up the phone, Sir Wan spoke to Zu'er with a serious tone.
0:43:14|0:43:18|Upon hearing this news, [Zu'er]'s last glimmer of hope was shattered.
0:43:18|0:43:20|Tears kept flowing from his eyes.
0:43:20|0:43:22|Sir Wan comforted Zu'er, saying,
0:43:25|0:43:28|At this moment, the nurse also walked in and spoke to [Sir Wan].
0:43:41|0:43:45|[Zu'er] nodded understandingly to her husband [Sir Wan], even though he was feeling a bit downcast.
0:43:45|0:43:50|Shortly after, [Sir Wan] gently kissed his forehead and left the hospital.
0:43:50|0:43:54|After Sir Wan left, Zu'er cried even more sorrowfully than before.
0:43:54|0:44:3|He looked at the pen in his hand, recalling the scene of cutting the pen for his brother in the restaurant. He concluded that it was his brother [A Hua] who killed his student.
0:44:3|0:44:7|On one hand, there is love, on the other hand, there is justice, which puts [Zu'er] in a dilemma.
0:44:7|0:44:10|When [Zu'er] returned to the ward after finishing the examination, the nurse said.
0:44:16|0:44:22|At the end of the story, [Zu'er] looked towards the man by the window, only to find that it was [A Hua].
0:44:25|0:44:27|[Zu'er] angrily threw the flowers in his face.
0:45:6|0:45:6|A Hua says.
0:45:6|0:45:15|He took out a stack of checks from his suit pocket, flipped to the page that had been prepared in advance, and deliberately walked up to [Zu'er] to sign his name.
0:45:15|0:45:23|Upon closer inspection, the check is worth millions of dollars, and [A Hua] plans to use this method to intimidate others.
0:45:47|0:45:53|A Hua, who was chased out of the ward, collided head-on with Sir Wan who had just arrived. The nurse and Sir Wan hurriedly inquired about Zu'er's condition.
0:45:56|0:46:5|After the events of the day, [A Hua] was restless at night, so he called [Da Sha] to discuss.
0:46:32|0:46:34|Sir Wan arrived at his father's house.
0:47:0|0:47:2|Indeed, A Hua has also returned home.
0:47:19|0:47:24|He always loses his temper, his father remains silent while drinking tea, and [Sir Wan] continues to ask.
0:48:0|0:48:1|The next day at the seaside.
0:48:29|0:48:36|The serious crime unit, led by [Sir Wan], came to inspect the body found at sea to see if it was Tan Lin.
0:48:36|0:48:42|At this moment, Sir Wan arrived just in time. Without even locking his car, he hurriedly ran towards the seaside.
0:48:42|0:48:44|He saw [Colleague] and asked.
0:49:10|0:49:14|[Zu'er] was discharged from the hospital with some injuries still on her face, but her mental state has improved a lot.
0:49:14|0:49:19|After finishing the housework, [Zu'er] fiddled with the decorations at home, waiting for her husband to come back.
0:49:19|0:49:21|Just then, the doorbell at home suddenly rang.
0:49:24|0:49:30|[Zu'er] heard the doorbell and thought it was [Sir Wan] coming back, so she immediately put down the decoration in her hand and opened the door with a smile.
0:49:30|0:49:34|To his surprise, the person who came was his brother [A Hua].
0:49:34|0:49:38|Even more unexpectedly, [A Hua] also brought [Da Sha] and three henchmen with him.
0:49:38|0:49:44|[A Hua] saw [Zu'er] without saying a word, while [Da Sha] and his men barged into Brother Cheng's room and started searching.
0:49:45|0:49:50|[A Hua] skillfully pulled the curtains closed, at this moment, [Sir Wan] and his father arrived at the underground garage.
0:50:2|0:50:13|[Zu'er] was pushed aside heavily by his subordinates, then quickly rummaged through the cabinet. Although [Zu'er] was [A Hua]'s sister, his subordinates showed no mercy. So [Zu'er] found [A Hua] and spoke to him.
0:50:38|0:50:45|The two people on the left didn't say a word, and one of them picked up the phone to make a call. Just as his hand reached the phone, he was fiercely jabbed by [Da Sha]'s cigarette butt.
0:51:17|0:51:21|[A Hua] stopped [Da Sha] and bent down beside Zu'er.
0:51:53|0:52:4|[A Hua] hugged [Da Sha] from behind, but [Da Sha] kicked [Zu'er] and sent her flying into the fish tank. In an instant, the water in the fish tank mixed with the electric wires, and Zu'er was electrocuted on the spot.
0:52:4|0:52:7|[A Hua] looked at Zu'er with a vacant and bewildered expression.
0:52:10|0:52:15|Several people found themselves in big trouble, so they had no time to look for the negatives and hurriedly left Zuo'er's house.
0:52:15|0:52:18|They didn't even dare to take the elevator, but walked towards the nearby fire escape.
0:52:18|0:52:24|Just then, the father who had taken the lead stepped out of the elevator and returned home to witness this scene.
0:52:26|0:52:33|Father Wan, ignoring the danger, rushed to Zu'er's side to help him up, but a huge electric current instantly threw him out.
0:52:41|0:52:44|[A Hua] drove away from the parking garage after shaking off [Da Sha]'s entanglement.
0:52:44|0:52:53|Fortunately, as Sir Wan's father was also a gangster when he was young, he had a strong physique. After being shocked, he didn't have too many problems and quickly got up and ran towards the basement.
0:52:53|0:52:56|At this moment, [Da Sha] also brought his little brothers and got on the car, ready to leave.
0:52:56|0:53:4|Father flips and jumps in the stairwell, reaching the next floor in a few seconds, while [Da Sha] is stuck in traffic, impatiently urging his younger brother.
0:53:8|0:53:10|At this moment, Sir Wan also returned home.
0:53:23|0:53:45|Because [Da Sha]'s car kept honking impatiently, the car in front accelerated and caused an accident at the intersection.
0:53:51|0:53:54|Two henchmen got out of the car aggressively and walked towards the car owner.
0:53:54|0:53:58|With the help of two henchmen, the driver quickly turned the situation around.
0:53:58|0:54:1|But these two car owners are also tough guys, even though they were beaten, they still refuse to admit defeat.
0:54:1|0:54:4|The battle between two and three has reached a stalemate for a moment.
0:54:9|0:54:27|Da Sha, who was trying to escape in a car, had just gotten out and taken a few steps when Brother Cheng kicked him flying with a powerful kick, sending him several meters away. In a sorry state, he even knocked over a handstand as he tried to get up. Brother Cheng then grabbed him by the collar, delivering two heavy blows to his head followed by two explosive punches, before slamming him hard against the wall. Da Sha was left sprawled on the ground, his teeth scattered from the repeated heavy punches.
0:54:27|0:54:31|But Brother Cheng did not give up easily, and continued to prepare to beat up Da Sha.
0:54:31|0:54:38|But as soon as he stepped forward, he was struck by the shovel wielded by the oncoming henchman. [Brother Cheng] fought back while retreating, constantly dodging the shovel attacks.
0:54:38|0:54:42|At this moment, the other two henchmen also finished dealing with the car owner in the car and attacked [Brother Cheng] together.
0:54:43|0:54:49|Brother Cheng quickly adjusted his position, knocked out one of the henchmen to use as a shield, while the rest of the henchmen hesitated and were knocked down one by one by Brother Cheng.
0:54:49|0:54:54|After getting up, [Brother Cheng] did not hesitate, but went straight after [Da Sha] with a clear goal in mind.
0:54:54|0:54:58|Brother Cheng grabbed a cement-filled cart and charged towards Da Sha with all his might.
0:54:58|0:55:1|[Da Sha] hurriedly flipped over the car, avoiding the impact of the stroller.
0:55:1|0:55:4|Brother Cheng, seeing the situation, picked up the fire axe nearby and swung it towards Da Sha.
0:55:4|0:55:10|Brother Cheng knocked down Da Sha, then raised the axe high above his head, preparing to deliver a fatal blow to Da Sha.
0:55:10|0:55:16|Unexpectedly, when the axe fell, it first hit the fire sprinkler, and [Da Sha] took the opportunity to slip away. At this time, all the younger brothers surrounded them.
0:55:16|0:55:19|Brother Cheng did not use an axe to strike the little brothers back.
0:55:19|0:55:23|Da Sha ran desperately all the way, from the underground parking lot to the main street.
0:55:23|0:55:27|Brother Cheng is glaring angrily, holding an axe in the back, desperately chasing after.
0:55:27|0:55:33|The henchmen who came to block the way were knocked down one by one by [Brother Cheng], and the group walked through the street without fear of passing vehicles.
0:55:33|0:55:38|Da Sha buried his head and ran desperately for a while, then turned back to find that he still couldn't shake off Brother Cheng.
0:55:38|0:55:40|Da Sha ran towards the crowded sidewalk.
0:55:40|0:55:44|Da Sha, whose speed slowed down, was chopped in the back by Brother Cheng with an axe.
0:55:44|0:55:47|At this moment, the enthusiastic citizens quickly found the patrol officer to explain the situation.
0:55:50|0:56:0|The police officer arrived just in time to see [Brother Cheng] wielding an axe and rushing towards Da Sha.
0:56:0|0:56:9|Brother Cheng took the opportunity to heavily strike Da Sha with an axe again. The patrol officer fired a warning shot into the air, but Chen Ge, who had lost his daughter in old age, had already disregarded life and death, paying no attention to the police.
0:56:9|0:56:14|The policeman reluctantly shot Chen Ge in the leg, finally calming down the chase.
0:56:14|0:56:18|Sir Wan rushed to the police station to inquire about the situation after receiving the news.
0:56:29|0:56:31|According to Sir Wan.
0:56:31|0:56:34|That guy appeared at the scene of the murder, and leader Sir Wan rushed over.
0:57:5|0:57:9|Sir Wan ignored the lawyer and walked straight to the leader's office.
0:57:14|0:57:18|Shortly after, [Da Sha] walked towards the door with a look of defiance on his face, accompanied by the lawyer.
0:57:39|0:57:41|He is a key figure in this murder case.
0:58:1|0:58:4|[Sir Wan] shouted "Yeah!" to express his dissatisfaction.
0:58:4|0:58:7|In just a few days, [Da Sha], who had bribed the witness, was acquitted.
0:58:7|0:58:12|Outside the courthouse, reporters crowded around.
0:58:12|0:58:17|[Da Sha] remained silent in the face of the reporter's questions, swaggering down the steps of the courthouse.
0:58:17|0:58:21|At this moment, [Sir Wan] walked up from the other side of the stairs.
0:58:21|0:58:23|Da Sha stopped in his tracks when he saw Sir Wan.
0:58:23|0:58:24|Sir Wan.
0:58:42|0:58:52|Sir Wan reluctantly took a step back.
0:58:52|0:58:56|Persuaded by his [colleagues], [Sir Wan] reluctantly left, just at that moment.
0:59:0|0:59:1|[A Hua] rushes forward.
0:59:5|0:59:12|[A Hua] was still angry. He looked at [Da Sha], who was covering his nose, ready to make another move, but was forcefully knocked down to the ground by the bodyguards beside him.
0:59:12|0:59:15|Later, they pinned [A Hua] down in the car, and [Da Sha] said to him.
0:59:39|0:59:43|In the evening, [Da Sha] and others were drinking in the private room of Mr. Ye's club.
0:59:43|0:59:47|Female police officer [Ami] disguised herself as a waitress and installed a bug under the guise of delivering a fruit bowl.
1:0:5|1:0:11|At this moment, [Sir Wan] was standing outside the meeting room, eavesdropping on every move inside.
1:0:55|1:1:0|After listening to Boss Cao's words, [A Hua] and [Da Sha] exchanged a glance and knew that they could not delay this matter any longer.
1:1:0|1:1:5|Although the police are watching him now, under the temptation of money, [A Hua] still agreed.
1:1:18|1:1:26|Although they overheard the conversation of several people, how could the group of people who have been in the rivers and lakes for many years openly discuss drugs in a nightclub like this?
1:1:26|1:1:32|The police officer with a bug installed didn't manage to obtain crucial evidence until [Da Sha] and his group left.
1:1:32|1:1:41|Sir Wan, who was forced to take a vacation, sat alone in the empty house. He looked at the room where he had lived with Zu'er for many years, and a sense of sadness surrounded him.
1:1:46|1:1:50|As a police officer, [Sir Wan] has never felt so powerless.
1:1:50|1:1:54|At this moment, the doorbell rang, and [Sir Wan] slowly opened the door like a zombie.
1:1:58|1:2:7|[Sir Wan] signed the document wearily and closed the door. He couldn't get over the fact that [Zu'er] had passed away. He didn't want to communicate with the outside world, so he didn't say a word to the delivery man.
1:2:7|1:2:17|After he opened the envelope, it was the film that [Zu'er] refused to hand over even in death. Feeling frustrated, [Sir Wan] didn't have the mood to look at it, but the police intuition made him feel that this roll of film was not simple.
1:2:18|1:2:27|[Sir Wan] looked at the dark film, but couldn't directly see the content of the photo, so he went out and came to the printing shop to print out the photo.
1:2:27|1:2:33|As he flipped through them one by one, he happened to see the photo of Tan Lin's body taken by Huang Zhiqiang in the cabin.
1:2:33|1:2:40|He immediately took off his sunglasses and looked carefully. After confirming the content, he went to the prison to visit his father, who comforted him when he saw him.
1:3:31|1:3:39|[Sir Wan] handed the prepared photo to his father when he noticed him lost in thought, and then continued to analyze in front of his father.
1:4:52|1:4:56|Coincidentally, just as the father was pondering, [A Hua] also came to visit him.
1:4:56|1:5:3|[Sir Wan] saw [A Hua] coming and knew that his visiting time was up, so he tactfully walked out on his own.
1:5:4|1:5:10|[Sir Wan] ignored [A Hua] and stood outside the door, watching [A Hua]'s every move with moist eyes.
1:6:23|1:6:24|The next day in the prison cell.
1:6:47|1:6:48|Sir Wan quickly resolved the situation.
1:7:9|1:7:14|Brother Cheng is Sir Wan's brother in the Jianghu, and they are planning to stage a fake injury scheme together.
1:7:14|1:7:30|Just as [Brother Cheng] was taking a shower, three henchmen suddenly rushed in from outside. One used a towel to strangle [Brother Cheng]'s neck, while the other two used toothbrushes as weapons to stab him. Caught off guard by the surprise attack, the seasoned [Brother Cheng] was unable to fight back and was quickly knocked unconscious. Fortunately, a fellow inmate called the prison guard for help.
1:7:37|1:7:42|Soon, the seriously injured [Brother Cheng] was urgently transported to the hospital by the prison vehicle for treatment.
1:7:42|1:7:52|Brother Cheng, lying on a stretcher with an oxygen mask, fell into a coma. The doctor accompanying him kept a close eye on his condition, while the prison guard in the car carelessly started to doze off.
1:7:52|1:7:54|When the car drove to the outskirts, [Brother Cheng] suddenly woke up and started shaking.
1:7:59|1:8:5|At this moment, [Brother Cheng] suddenly took off the oxygen mask, got up and knocked the doctor unconscious to the side.
1:8:5|1:8:10|The awakened prison guard had just opened his eyes and before he could figure out the situation, he was kicked out of the car by [Brother Cheng].
1:8:10|1:8:18|The poor prison guard was rolling on the ground, but luckily not in danger of losing his life. [Brother Cheng] also took the opportunity to jump out of the police car and escape into the nearby woods.
1:8:18|1:8:22|Soon, Sir Wan heard the news of his father's jailbreak on TV.
1:8:36|1:8:41|Upon hearing this, Wang Yongqiang lowered his head in contemplation. At this moment, the leader in the police station spoke during the meeting,
1:8:47|1:8:49|The first thing he does when he comes out is to look for [Da Sha].
1:9:0|1:9:8|Captain Chen, at night, after [Da Sha] returned home, he saw a police car at the door and immediately asked without any courtesy.
1:9:26|1:9:30|After [Da Sha] smugly taunted, he instructed his henchman to step on the gas and drive into the luxury mansion.
1:9:30|1:9:34|The police officer at the door was very unhappy with [Da Sha], but could only swallow his anger.
1:9:34|1:9:41|After driving the car to the entrance, [Da Sha] proudly got out of the car, with two young girls clinging to him.
1:10:3|1:10:21|At that moment, the wooden door of the room was instantly shattered by a shotgun, and [Brother Cheng] kicked the door, aiming a shot at [Da Sha]. However, [Da Sha] reacted quickly, leaping and crashing through the glass to escape the room. The henchmen pulled out their guns to retaliate, but before they could aim properly, [Brother Cheng] took them all out with a single shot each. [Brother Cheng] continued the pursuit.
1:10:25|1:10:34|But the police were all colleagues of [Sir Wan], and they didn't immediately shoot when they saw [Brother Cheng]. [Brother Cheng] was well aware of this, so he ignored them and chased after [Da Sha] who was running away.
1:10:34|1:10:42|[Da Sha] ran all the way to the edge of the swimming pool, seeing no way out in front of him, he jumped directly into the pool. At this moment, a large number of special police officers who had received the notification also arrived outside the mansion.
1:10:48|1:10:51|[Da Sha] held his breath, hiding at the bottom of the pool, afraid to show his head.
1:10:51|1:10:55|Brother Cheng angrily fired shots at the water, when the special police arrived.
1:10:58|1:11:7|Brother Cheng, in a hurry, fired underwater without hesitation. After two shots, he found the gun was out of bullets. At this moment, the special police also started firing at Brother Cheng.
1:11:7|1:11:21|Brother Cheng quickly hid in the woods when he saw the situation. Fortunately, with the cover of the night, the special police did not hit Brother Cheng. Sir Wan's colleagues also arrived in time to rescue Da Sha.
1:11:21|1:11:25|Brother Cheng saw [Da Sha] preparing to continue shooting with a handgun, but he was suddenly taken away by a masked man.
1:11:31|1:11:35|Afterwards, Sir Wan's colleagues quietly searched for Brother Cheng's whereabouts in the woods.
1:11:35|1:11:41|At the same time, Brother Cheng has been taken to a safe place by the masked man on a motorcycle.
1:11:41|1:11:45|But after the two entered the room, they discovered that the masked man was actually [Sir Wan].
1:11:45|1:11:49|He cautiously closed the door, drew the curtains, and then turned around to ask.
1:13:2|1:13:15|[Sir Wan] slowly stood up and walked to his father's side, gently placing his hand on his shoulder, comforting him.
1:13:15|1:13:19|Just then, the doorbell suddenly rang.
1:13:27|1:13:32|[Sir Wan] saw his father entering the bedroom, he peeped through the peephole and confirmed it was his colleague before opening the door.
1:13:46|1:13:52|Brother Wang sat nervously in the bedroom, looking around helplessly, then he heard several people discussing in the living room.
1:14:4|1:14:9|At this moment, [Ah Min] took out a black box and handed it to [Sir Wan], saying to him.
1:14:30|1:14:33|After listening to the content of the recording, everyone present fell silent.
1:14:33|1:14:37|In the bedroom, after hearing this, [Brother Cheng] was even more exhausted.
1:14:54|1:14:59|Sir Wan was not in the mood to joke with his colleague at the moment, Zu'er remarked.
1:15:5|1:15:11|[Ami] was cleaning up the room when she accidentally saw a newspaper with the headline "123 Clean Hong Kong Grand Action".
1:15:19|1:15:26|The father overheard the conversation of several people clearly, and the next day, [A Hua] and others contacted Boss Cao.
1:15:26|1:15:32|[Da Sha] and [A Hua], along with a few others, disguised themselves as elementary school teachers. They casually got off the bus with a relaxed demeanor.
1:16:28|1:16:34|Boss Cao and [Da Sha] watched with satisfaction as the elementary school students diligently picked up all the drugs and put them into the trash bags.
1:16:34|1:16:38|Little did they know, Sir Wan had already sent people to secretly observe them.
1:16:38|1:16:47|Innocent elementary school students and teachers, unaware that they have become tools.
1:16:58|1:17:9|At this moment, Wang Yongqiang inadvertently saw Brother Cheng holding a handgun, also lurking on the side.
1:17:9|1:17:14|When the colleagues were still puzzled, Wang Yongqiang had already arrived in front of Brother Cheng.
1:17:30|1:17:43|Faced with the obstruction from his son-in-law, [Brother Cheng] hesitated. Unexpectedly, just as [Brother Cheng] hesitated, Wang Yongqiang suddenly made a move against his father. He first snatched the father's gun, then ruthlessly knocked him down, followed by a blow that rendered his father unconscious.
1:17:45|1:17:48|Wang Yongqiang put handcuffs on his father, Sir Wan.
1:17:48|1:17:55|On the other side, in order to make his performance more realistic, [Da Sha] even prepared ice cream and drinks for the students.
1:18:2|1:18:7|After collecting the drugs, the henchmen brought the drugs in front of Da Sha and A Hua.
1:18:7|1:18:12|[A Hua] nodded in satisfaction after watching, indicating the success of their transaction.
1:18:12|1:18:18|Meanwhile, Brother Cheng, who was knocked unconscious by Sir Wan, gradually regained consciousness, but the handcuffs on his hands restrained him.
1:18:18|1:18:24|At this moment, [Da Sha] and Mr. Cao and others came to the table, each opening a bottle of drink, and started celebrating in advance.
1:18:30|1:18:33|Just then, Sir Wan's colleague suddenly arrived.
1:18:55|1:19:3|The police officer immediately opened the boxes held by several henchmen, only to find brand new hundred-dollar bills inside, and quickly reported to [Sir Wan].
1:19:24|1:19:27|Sir Wan rushed to the beach to check the situation as soon as Lao Ye spoke.
1:19:27|1:19:34|He watched as the elementary school students dragged bag after bag of garbage towards the recycling point, without noticing any clues for a moment.
1:19:34|1:19:41|As a veteran detective, Sir Wan knew that this case was far from simple. However, as he looked at the various types of garbage bags on the beach, he also found himself at a loss for a moment.
1:19:41|1:19:48|At this moment, some fine powder was exposed in a primary school student's garbage bag. Lao Ye pinched a bit and found out it was drugs.
1:19:48|1:20:1|He was about to report when he was unexpectedly shot in the arm. The peaceful and cheerful beach just now turned into a battlefield with bullets flying everywhere. Upon seeing this, [Sir Wan] quickly shouted.
1:20:1|1:20:17|Da Sha kicked over the dining table, took out the machine gun that was placed behind the table in advance, and his men started shooting wildly after grabbing their guns. Sir Wan and his team quickly fought back, but at this moment, the beach was filled with fleeing students, teachers, and tourists. Sir Wan quickly shouted to the other police officers.
1:20:25|1:20:34|The henchmen threw a lot of cash into the air. The tourists who were just scared and covering their heads a moment ago, upon seeing the money, were no longer afraid of the robbers shooting and all rushed forward.
1:20:34|1:20:39|At this moment, all they could see in their eyes were banknotes. In the blink of an eye, the road had been completely blocked.
1:20:48|1:21:6|[Sir Wan] led the team to continue chasing after the thugs. As they got closer, the thugs turned around and started shooting indiscriminately. [Sir Wan] quickly commanded the team to fire back, and the henchmen started shooting at [Sir Wan]. He reacted swiftly by lying on the ground and then turned around to kill two henchmen. Meanwhile, [A Hua] and Xiao Wang caught up with Boss Cao on the other side.
1:21:8|1:21:13|Sir Wan and Zu'er fired their guns, killing the henchman holding the money box. The bandit, enraged, retaliated by shooting back.
1:21:13|1:21:15|Xiao Wang immediately tackled [Ah Min], but he was also hit.
1:21:20|1:21:38|After Boss Cao shook off the police, Jimang and his henchman ran towards a nearby sedan. [Ah Min] scrambled away, and Jimang adjusted his posture and shot at the two, but they were too agile and managed to get into the car. Even so, [Ah Min] did not give up. He ran directly towards a side alley, where the two men's vehicle happened to break down.
1:21:39|1:21:55|[Da Sha] disregarded the danger and jumped directly onto the roof of the car. However, the smooth roof provided no grip, and soon he slipped off the roof. Just as he was about to fall off the car, [Da Sha] grabbed onto the rear bumper of the vehicle, with his body being dragged along by the car. Shortly after, he was flung off by the driver using a fuel tank in the front, but [Da Sha] ignored the chest pain.
1:21:55|1:22:5|Rising quickly and shooting, a precise shot blew up the car's fuel tank, causing the car to burst into flames instantly. After driving for a few seconds, it suddenly exploded, leaving Boss Cao and his henchman trapped in the car.
1:22:5|1:22:12|On the other side, [Sir Wan] chased [Da Sha] and [A Hua] into an abandoned building, where they ran and shot at each other, but neither side hit the other.
1:22:12|1:22:14|Brother Cheng also sneaked into the building at this time.
1:22:16|1:22:23|[A Hua] quickly reached out and climbed upstairs after hearing, while [Da Sha] hid in the room, observing [Sir Wan] through the window.
1:22:23|1:22:31|Da Sha happened to enter the room where Brother Cheng was hiding. When he saw Da Sha coming, Brother Cheng, who was unarmed, quietly hid behind the wooden board.
1:22:31|1:22:38|[Da Sha] smashed the glass, extended the machine gun out of the window, aiming towards [Sir Wan], while [Brother Cheng] held his breath, slowly moving his body inch by inch.
1:22:39|1:22:45|With his left hand pinned against the water pipe by Sir Wan, Brother Cheng had to be careful of the sound coming from the handcuffs.
1:22:45|1:22:54|At this moment, [Da Sha] saw [Sir Wan] and immediately opened fire. [Sir Wan], who was agile, dodged the attack first, then took advantage of [Da Sha]'s momentary distraction to fly to the other side.
1:22:54|1:23:2|Unexpectedly, [A Hua] on the roof suddenly opened fire at him. In order to break free from the handcuffs, [Brother Cheng] endured the intense pain and prepared to forcibly remove the handcuffs.
1:23:2|1:23:5|But the sound of handcuffs rubbing against bones was still heard by [Da Sha].
1:23:6|1:23:10|[Da Sha] cautiously walked towards [Brother Cheng] with a machine gun in hand.
1:23:10|1:23:13|At this moment, [Brother Cheng]'s hand was already handcuffed and bloodied.
1:23:13|1:23:20|At this critical moment of life and death, [Brother Cheng] roared loudly, broke free from the handcuffs, then quickly smashed through the wooden board and tackled [Da Sha] to the ground.
1:23:20|1:23:30|At this moment, outside the building, [Sir Wan] heard the commotion and quietly changed his position. Just as he moved to the window where [Da Sha] was, preparing to shoot, he suddenly saw [Brother Cheng] beating up [Da Sha].
1:23:30|1:23:33|He accidentally injured Brother Cheng and then ran into the building with the gun.
1:23:33|1:23:36|Just as they entered the building, a fierce gun battle broke out with [A Hua].
1:23:36|1:23:41|A Hua, holding a submachine gun, still couldn't suppress the anger burning inside Sir Wan.
1:23:41|1:23:50|A Hua, after a burst of firepower suppression, hurriedly ran into the corridor. When he chased [Sir Yongqiang] around the corner into the corridor, he found it empty.
1:23:50|1:23:57|Sir Wan instantly became more alert when he couldn't see anyone, holding a handgun and slowly feeling his way forward. There are dozens of windows on both sides of the corridor.
1:23:57|1:24:4|Sir Wan looked around carefully, checking his surroundings nervously. Just as he was conducting a tense search, A Hua had already quietly extended a submachine gun upstairs and aimed it at him.
1:24:4|1:24:13|A Hua ruthlessly pulled the trigger, luckily Sir Wan reacted in time, quickly dodged and counterattacked, fortunately the bullet only hit Sir Wan's arm.
1:24:13|1:24:29|In the building, [Da Sha] was kicked away by [Brother Cheng], who immediately rushed over to continue the beating. However, at this moment, [Da Sha] picked up a brick, turned around and pushed [Brother Cheng] aside. [Da Sha] quickly crawled out, grabbed a machine gun and started shooting wildly. [Brother Cheng] then flew over, knocked down the machine gun, and kicked [Da Sha], causing him to spit out blood.
1:24:29|1:24:31|But [Brother Cheng] was also hit in the leg by machine gun fire.
1:24:32|1:24:36|[Brother Cheng], relying on his strong willpower, propped himself up against the wall and walked towards [Da Sha].
1:24:36|1:24:40|On the other side, [Sir Wan] who was chasing A Hua also found himself in a passive situation.
1:24:40|1:24:45|He chased all the way until he walked into a dark room, with only a few small windows around letting in faint light.
1:24:45|1:24:47|At that moment, he didn't dare to chase recklessly.
1:24:48|1:25:4|At that moment, [A Hua], who was hiding in the dark, suddenly emerged from the haystack and started shooting in the direction of [Sir Wan]. [Sir Wan] rolled forward and hid in the corner of the room, then seized the opportunity to aim and shoot, hitting [A Hua] directly in the abdomen in one swift motion.
1:25:4|1:25:17|Shortly after, [Sir Wan] cleverly hid behind the wall, ready to strike at any moment. When there was no sound for a while, he decisively followed out. A beam of light shone in, revealing a passage leading straight to the roof. Without hesitation, [Sir Wan] went straight up to the roof.
1:25:23|1:25:28|On the other side, due to Brother Cheng's arms and legs being severely injured, the battle advantage has shifted heavily towards Da Sha.
1:25:28|1:25:36|[Da Sha] kept hitting [Brother Cheng] with a thick wooden stake, while [Brother Cheng], unable to move freely, could only bear each heavy blow with his body.
1:25:36|1:25:47|Finally, [Brother Cheng] seized the opportunity when [Da Sha] attacked, and tightly bound [Da Sha]'s waist. Unable to fully utilize the wooden stake in his hand, [Da Sha] threw it away and started using his elbow to strike [Brother Cheng]'s back.
1:25:47|1:25:52|Brother Cheng, although not strong in physical strength, opened his mouth and fiercely bit Da Sha's belly.
1:25:52|1:25:57|Da Sha screamed in pain, hurriedly threw Brother Cheng against the wall, which forced Brother Cheng to release his mouth.
1:25:58|1:26:13|After Sir Wan reached the rooftop, he didn't find any trace of A Hua. He cautiously moved along the rooftop towards the possible path A Hua might have taken, trying his best to make no sound. However, what he didn't expect was that A Hua was hiding just below the roof.
1:26:14|1:26:23|[A Hua] heard the noise and immediately started shooting at the roof. [Sir Wan] hurriedly dodged, but accidentally fell off the roof and landed right into a pigeon coop.
1:26:23|1:26:30|The pigeons, startled, flapped around in the cage, with countless pigeons and feathers making it impossible for [Sir Wan] to see the situation outside.
1:26:31|1:26:41|He fumbled in the cage, trying to find the door to get out, while Brother Cheng was already beaten by Da Sha, barely holding on with the anger of avenging his daughter.
1:26:41|1:26:46|At this moment, [Da Sha] picked up the rope on the ground and put it around [Brother Cheng]'s neck, preparing to strangle him.
1:26:46|1:26:55|[Sir Wan] happened to see this scene at the edge of the cage, so he made a flying leap, crashed into the cage, rolled from the top floor to the ground, and fired two shots at [Da Sha], directly killing him.
1:26:56|1:27:10|At this moment, [A Hua] behind [Sir Wan] shot his gun-holding hand.
1:27:10|1:27:14|[A Hua] ruthlessly fired the gun, hitting all four limbs of [Sir Wan] in succession.
1:27:14|1:27:21|Just as A Hua was about to shoot Sir Wan, a tearing pain in his abdomen made him look incredulously at his father.
1:27:25|1:27:30|In this way, Brother Cheng, in order to save Sir Wan, personally fired the gun to end the crimes of Zu'er's son, A Hua.
1:27:30|1:27:40|Watching [A Hua] fall from the roof, [Brother Cheng] felt immense pain in his heart. He kept muttering [A Hua]'s name, but the overwhelming emotions made his throat unable to produce any sound.
1:27:43|1:27:51|Although suffering a great loss, [Brother Cheng] and son-in-law [Sir Wan] successfully dismantled the drug trafficking group in Hong Kong, finally avenging their daughter themselves.
