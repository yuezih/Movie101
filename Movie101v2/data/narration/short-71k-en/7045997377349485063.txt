0:1:27|0:1:49|The battlefield is covered in yellow sand, with both sides of the army facing each other for a long time. On one side are the heavily armored Qing dynasty soldiers, and on the other side are a group of fearless warriors with white headscarves. They are the followers of the Tianli Sect, who now possess tens of thousands of divine soldiers, dominating the regions around Beijing and Shandong. Among these divine soldiers, there is a strange character who will later become a grandmaster of martial arts.
0:1:49|0:2:0|Describing him as a weirdo is not an exaggeration at all. While the battlefield is filled with smoke, he remains standing in place, engrossed in watching ants building their nests. Suddenly, a comrade throws a long spear towards the weirdo.
0:2:6|0:2:26|The eccentric [Yang Luchan] excitedly took the pellet gun and aimed it at the battlefield, striking a handsome pose. With a loud shout, he swiftly charged into the battlefield, heading towards the area with the most Qing soldiers. Seeing the menacing figure, the Qing soldiers swept their swords towards his lower body, but [Yang Luchan] leaped up, dodging the attack and swiftly knocked down two soldiers with his spear.
0:2:26|0:2:45|He then skillfully maneuvered his weapon, swiftly defeating the surrounding soldiers. At that moment, the leader of the Tianli Sect was observing the battlefield through a monocular telescope and immediately spotted the Qing cavalry, brandishing their long spears as they charged towards the battlefield.
0:2:54|0:3:11|A Nan rode into the battlefield and knocked [Yang Luchan] to the ground. He lifted his headscarf and delivered a punch to the right temple of [Yang Luchan]. Instantly, veins bulged on [Yang Luchan]'s forehead, his eye sockets were only left with red and white, his messy long hair moved without wind, and most terrifyingly, his face became fierce, showing signs of going berserk.
0:3:11|0:3:40|As for why [Yang Luchan] turned out like this, we have to start from his birth. The story took place 18 years ago in Guangping Prefecture, Hebei. On this night, the Yang family's mansion was brightly lit. Amidst the lightning and thunder, the young master of the Yang family was born. Different from ordinary babies, this young master flew from the delivery bed into the hands of the wet nurse. He sucked his fingers without crying or fussing, but there was a strange thing growing above his right temple. The weak smile of the newly delivered Yang family mistress named him [Yang Luchan], after the observation of the physician.
0:3:40|0:3:54|Discovering a lump on his forehead, but [Yang's Mother] paid no attention to it. She firmly believed that her son would achieve great things and showered all her love on [Yang Luchan]. [Yang Luchan] was naturally dull-witted and stubborn, coupled with the lump on his forehead, which led to him never being valued by [Yang's Father].
0:3:55|0:4:11|That day, [Yang's Mother] put a delicate melon hat on [Yang Luchan] and eagerly gestured to her husband to look at their presentable son. However, [Yang's Father], busy with his abacus, didn't even look up. Unwilling to give up, [Yang's Mother] made the request again, but [Yang's Father] coldly shook off her hand and left. At that moment, young [Yang Luchan] had already eaten the fruits on the tree.
0:4:11|0:4:21|Facing the scolding from [Yang's Mom], little [Yang Luchan] just pitifully said he was hungry. [Yang's Mom], who grew up in the martial arts world, believed that human nature is inherently evil and one must rely on oneself. She had to make plans for herself and [Yang Luchan].
0:4:21|0:4:29|Yang's Mom caught her husband red-handed in the study with the account books. As the seasons changed, Yang Luchan grew day by day. One day, he bought a string of candied haws on the street.
0:4:29|0:4:41|The founder of the family troupe, [Old Zhao], happened to be performing on the street with his apprentice, while [Yang Luchan] excitedly pushed through the crowd with a candied fruit stick in hand to watch the show. Suddenly, [Old Zhao] performed a carp jump and instantly received a round of applause.
0:4:41|0:4:48|[Yang Luchan] used both hands and feet to imitate the movements of [Old Zhao], completely unaware that he had already caught the attention of the chubby boy next to him.
0:4:48|0:5:8|The chubby boy took advantage of [Yang Luchan]'s inattention to snatch the candied hawthorn from his hand, then ran off. When caught up by [Yang Luchan], the chubby boy remained very arrogant, even taking a bite of the candied hawthorn in front of him. Angered, [Yang Luchan] rushed forward to snatch it back, only to have his hat knocked off by the chubby boy's companion. Seeing the flesh horn on [Yang Luchan]'s forehead, the chubby boy burst into laughter and even reached out to poke it hard.
0:5:8|0:5:13|The child, who was still lively and jumping around, unexpectedly fell straight down after being hit.
0:5:13|0:5:32|The chubby boy and his gang were scared silly, even the adults watching the acrobatics gathered around. Seeing the audience dispersing, [Old Zhao] was also at a loss and couldn't help but join in the fun. [Yang Luchan] had his eyes tightly closed, his young face quickly covered with veins. Suddenly, he clenched his fist, performed a carp jump and stood up, shouting loudly, and rushed towards those people.
0:5:32|0:5:44|Surprisingly, this move is exactly the same as the one [Old Zhao] used before. With one punch, [Yang Luchan] sent the big kid in front flying three meters away. Then, with another punch, the chubby kid also flew up and smashed the plaque behind him into two halves.
0:5:44|0:6:4|[Old Zhao] stepped forward to pull [Yang Luchan], who was about to start a fight with a group of kids. However, [Yang Luchan] hit back with a punch, causing [Old Zhao] to step back several steps. While stepping back, [Old Zhao] couldn't help but marvel at the strength of [Yang Luchan]. After this punch, [Yang Luchan] seemed to lose his strength, rolling his eyes and staggering backwards. Suddenly, two streams of nosebleed gushed out from his nose.
0:6:4|0:6:15|[Yang Luchan] fainted with his eyes closed. At the same time, [Yang's Mom] was caught red-handed stealing money. She was kneeling in the hall, and [Yang's Father] threw a pile of account books at her face, demanding to know how much money she had stolen.
0:6:17|0:6:27|[Yang's Mom] calmly said she was making plans for [Yang Luchan], [Yang's Father] heard this and angrily kicked towards her, but was bitten on the calf in return. Enraged, [Yang's Father] ordered the servants to kill [Yang's Mom], who angrily retorted, "Who dares?"
0:6:27|0:6:29|No one dared to approach the servants of the Yang family.
0:6:29|0:6:53|[Yang's Mother] choked back tears as she accused [Yang's Father] of being despicable. She said there was no need for servants to do the dirty work, and then she went straight to a nearby pillar and slammed her head against it. In an instant, all she could see was a sea of red. By this time, [Yang Luchan] had already regained consciousness. He grabbed a pancake and started walking home, with [Old Zhao] and his disciple following closely behind. The disciple couldn't understand why they were following [Yang Luchan], but [Old Zhao] simply explained that this child was very important.
0:6:53|0:7:0|As the three of them arrived at the entrance of Yang's residence, they saw several servants dragging the unconscious Yang's Mother and throwing her onto a side path.
0:7:0|0:7:5|[Yang Luchan] stood still for a moment, threw away the pancake in his hand, and pounced on [Yang's Mom], shouting "Mother!"
0:7:5|0:7:11|In the blink of an eye, with the wind and snow raging, [Yang's Mother] weakly leaned against a withered tree, regretting that she could no longer take care of [Yang Luchan].
0:7:11|0:7:17|[Old Zhao] hurriedly stepped forward and introduced himself as Zhao Kanping. He pulled [Yang Luchan] over and pointed to the piece of meat, explaining,
0:7:17|0:7:26|This is actually the Three Flowers Gathering at the Top. Most people can't reach this level even after decades of practice. He praised [Yang Luchan] as a genius with unlimited potential.
0:7:26|0:7:37|Yang's mother, with a weak smile, agreed after a moment of thought and immediately asked Yang Luchan to kneel down to Old Zhao, saying that as long as she trusted him, she would let him take care of Yang Luchan.
0:7:37|0:7:45|In this world, besides himself, only [Old Zhao] recognized [Yang Luchan] as a genius, and at the same time she advised [Yang Luchan] to do this one thing well in his life.
0:7:45|0:7:54|[Yang Luchan] looked at his mother with a silly smile after paying respects to his master. [Yang's Mom], with tears in her eyes, lied to him that she wanted to take a nap, and then peacefully passed away leaning against a tree.
0:7:54|0:8:3|Yang Luchan, penniless, buried his mother with the help of Old Zhao and his disciples. Afterwards, the young child tearfully kowtowed three times in front of his mother's grave.
0:8:3|0:8:11|Old Zhao followed the new master and left. He recognized the three flowers on the top of the head as a sign and insisted on supporting Yang Luchan, which clearly had a hidden agenda.
0:8:11|0:8:24|This is the tragic childhood experience of the eccentric [Yang Luchan]. The original noble son of the Ya Mansion could only accompany the battlefield of the Yellow Sand in the end. In the blink of an eye, 10 years have passed, and [Yang Luchan] has become a divine soldier, the strongest weapon used by the Tianli Sect to deal with the Qing army.
0:8:24|0:8:33|And [Old Zhao] is the head of the Tianli Sect. Back then, he pretended to be a street performer, but in reality, he was recruiting soldiers and challenging the ruling authorities.
0:8:41|0:8:52|The memory flashback ends, the scene returns to the battlefield, only to see [A Nan] dismounting and knocking down [Yang Luchan], while delivering a punch to the flesh corner of his right temple. By the time [Yang Luchan] gets up, he has already returned to his violent state.
0:8:52|0:9:6|He caught two long spears thrown by the Qing soldiers barehanded, then rushed forward and knocked the two soldiers away. Later, [Yang Luchan] smashed another soldier into the air and caught the man's helmet, throwing it towards the soldiers nearby. Any object around [Yang Luchan] could become a weapon in his hands.
0:9:6|0:9:20|He then lifted a shield, held it above his head to catch the blades swung by the soldiers, and instantly flipped them all over. At this moment, he was like a human killing machine that no one dared to approach. However, when he stopped, nosebleed sprayed out again.
0:9:22|0:9:33|The battle ended quickly, with [A Nan] riding his horse swiftly into the camp. [Yang Luchan] lay unconscious on the horse's back, while [A Nan] riding the horse looked extremely anxious.
0:9:35|0:9:41|[A Nan] stopped in front of a tent treating wounded soldiers and pulled [Yang Luchan] off his horse. Inside the tent, there were wounded soldiers missing arms and legs everywhere.
0:9:41|0:9:45|A physician is stitching up a soldier's wound with a needle.
0:9:45|0:10:0|[A Nan] rushed into the tent with the unconscious [Yang Luchan] on his back, carefully laying him on the bed in front of the physician. He leaned in close to whisper something to the physician, while [Dong Ye] nonchalantly puffed on his long pipe, blowing smoke rings with a casual air.
0:10:6|0:10:20|[Dong Ye] opened his eyes, spat out some tobacco leaves, tapped [Yang Luchan]'s head with his pipe to signal him to turn around. Then he leaned over [Yang Luchan]'s head for a while before sitting back in his chair and picking up some tobacco residue.
0:11:53|0:12:9|Old Zhao threw a punch straight at Dong Ye's abdomen as he spoke. Dong Ye sucked in his stomach to dodge the punch, then pushed his belly forward to force Old Zhao back several steps. Refusing to back down, Old Zhao grabbed Dong Ye's neck, but Dong Ye used his pipe as a weapon to strike Old Zhao's arm. When Old Zhao let go, Dong Ye grabbed his opponent's robe and pulled it up.
0:12:12|0:12:29|Old Zhao, who was furious, stood up and performed a sweeping leg kick towards Dong Ye. Dong Ye stepped on his foot and blocked Old Zhao's fist. Failing in his first attempt, Old Zhao then pushed Dong Ye away and delivered a flying kick. Dong Ye kneeled down, grabbed Old Zhao's kicking leg, and used internal force to send him flying.
0:12:34|0:12:40|With a disdainful look at Old Zhao lying on the straw mat, Dong Ye picked up his pipe and turned away.
0:12:40|0:12:48|Leaving only a back view for the stunned followers of the Tianli Sect. At night, while the soldiers were already asleep, only [Yang Luchan] stayed awake all night, staring with wide eyes.
0:13:4|0:13:12|While [Yang Luchan] tossed and turned in his sleepless state, a single telescope quietly observed the camp of the Tianli Sect.
0:13:21|0:13:36|[Yang Luchan] rushed out of the tent in a panic, only to see flames soaring outside. The Qing army and the Tianli Sect were fighting fiercely. The physician [Dong Ye] was shot through by arrows from the Qing army. [Yang Luchan] hurried to support [Dong Ye], but they both fell to the ground together.
0:13:55|0:14:3|[Dong Ye] left in this way. The Heavenly Way Sect was just a group of untrained individuals, quickly defeated by the well-trained Qing army and scattered in all directions.
0:14:18|0:14:29|[A Nan], engulfed in flames, was burned beyond recognition. He mustered his last bit of strength to kick open the collapsed watchtower and bury himself underneath it. [Yang Luchan] looked on in confusion at everything before ultimately gritting his teeth and escaping.
0:14:29|0:14:38|The Tianli Sect's camp turned into a sea of fire, burning for a long time, leaving only bare frames of the tents. The victorious Qing army, after slaughtering all the sect members,
0:14:38|0:14:44|The army flag was raised high and departed. With this, our film Tai Chi 1: Starting from Zero officially begins.
0:14:44|0:15:1|This film is the first 3D martial arts movie in which Eddie Peng starred. In addition to his first appearance in period costume drama, it is also the first time in his 10-year career that he played a villain. The protagonist of the film, portrayed by Yuan Xiaochao, is not a professional actor but a martial arts expert who won the national stick fighting championship in 2007.
0:15:1|0:15:10|He won the men's long fist championship at the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games, and starring in Tai Chi 1 made him the most expensive newcomer in Huayi's history.
0:15:10|0:15:20|The character he played, [Yang Luchan], is a real historical figure who founded the Yang-style Tai Chi. He was the first martial artist in Chinese history to promote Tai Chi.
0:15:20|0:15:31|Yang's Tai Chi, modified by the Yang family for non-martial arts purposes, is easy to learn, making it the most popular Chinese martial art in the world today with the largest number of practitioners.
0:15:32|0:15:38|The story goes back to the moment when [Yang Luchan], who narrowly escaped death, followed the advice of [Dong Ye] and embarked on a journey to [Chen Village].
0:15:41|0:15:47|Several children stood on a hill, looking down at [Yang Luchan] at the foot of the mountain.
0:15:53|0:16:13|The child pointed behind him simultaneously, only to see a towering mountain shrouded in mist, reaching straight into the sky. [Yang Luchan] is a person of great determination, the seemingly endless mountain in front of him did not instill any fear in him. Without a moment of hesitation, he immediately set foot on the road to [Chen Family Valley]. The mountain was extremely steep, almost a 70-degree slope.
0:16:13|0:16:21|[Yang Luchan] carefully stepped on the rocks as he climbed upwards, with broken rocks falling beneath his feet. After climbing for who knows how long, he finally could see the mountaintop.
0:16:21|0:16:33|[Yang Luchan] climbed up the last rock and stood on the top of the mountain. The long climb left him panting heavily. As he gasped for air, he looked down and suddenly a smile couldn't help but appear at the corner of his mouth.
0:16:33|0:16:48|In the next second, [Yang Luchan] has already started running forward, with many weeds on the mountaintop, but they cannot stop his pace. He uses both hands and feet to cross over the rocks to the other end of the mountain top. In front of him, the mountains still stretch endlessly, but at the foot of the mountain is a village, not very large in scale, standing alone.
0:16:48|0:17:0|It seems like forgotten, the Chen Family Valley is just ahead, and the test that [Yang Luchan] is about to face begins at this moment. [Yang Luchan] strides with a cheerful pace, running through a patch of grassland, unaware of
0:17:0|0:17:12|Just passing by a big tree, a person with a bamboo hat hanging upside down with a hook, suspending himself on the tree. Quietly observing him, soon [Yang Luchan] arrived in front of a stone wall with three strong and powerful characters carved on it: Chen Family Valley.
0:17:23|0:17:28|[Yang Luchan] looked confused for a moment, then ran towards a mahjong table.
0:17:33|0:18:2|Suddenly, a steam car appeared at the village entrance, driving recklessly and unsteadily. The driver seemed unfamiliar with the controls, causing the car to swerve all the way. Villagers panicked and dodged as the steering wheel was abruptly turned, sending the car spinning out sideways. [Yang Luchan] was just turning around when this massive object came crashing towards him. Unable to avoid it, he was directly hit and sent flying. The car then went on to knock over a steamed bun stall and a watermelon stand before finally coming to a shaky stop.
0:18:2|0:18:23|A woman hurriedly ran off the car and headed straight for [Yang Luchan]. She squatted down anxiously and asked, the woman was the only daughter of the head of the Chen family, [Chen Yuniang]. [Yang Luchan] sat up dazedly, his eyes lit up when he saw the scattered steamed buns around him. Ignoring [Chen Yuniang], he picked up a steamed bun and gobbled it up hungrily.
0:18:26|0:18:32|Fang Zijing, wearing a top hat, gets off the car and elegantly buttons up his suit.
0:19:0|0:19:6|[Yang Luchan] kept his mouth half open, stuffed with a steamed bun, unable to close it for a long time. The steam car started again.
0:19:6|0:19:20|[Fang Zijing] drove towards the village with a touch of aloofness and pride, while [Chen Yuniang] sat in the passenger seat, laughing happily. It was only then that [Yang Luchan] reacted, turned around and ran towards the car, but his legs were no match for the speed of the wheels, and the car drove further and further away.
0:19:20|0:19:30|[Yang Luchan] stopped in his tracks and gazed ahead foolishly. The car entered the first gate, and facing him was a stone arch bridge. Only by passing through here could one truly enter Chen Family Village.
0:19:32|0:19:42|The village, though small, embodies the saying that even a small sparrow has all five internal organs. Right next to the stone bridge are the archway and teahouse, with the market and post office located in the center of the village. The villagers rarely see this peculiarly shaped iron box.
0:19:42|0:19:54|The steam car was stopped by curious villagers wherever it went. Further in was the Qingfeng Ridge, at the foot of which sat the [Chen Family Ancestral Hall], also the gathering place for the entire [Chen Family Valley].
0:19:54|0:20:10|[Ancestral Hall] Next door is an ear room, which also serves as a utility room. At this moment, the ear room is bustling with activity. [Chen Youzhi] is vigorously pedaling, driving a large wheel to spin rapidly. The wires at the bottom of the wheel are connected to the light bulb on the nearby table.
0:20:10|0:20:16|Chen Gengyun stared at the light bulb seriously for a long time. When it didn't respond, he couldn't help but complain,
0:20:48|0:21:5|Chen Gengyun quietly twisted the knob next to him, and the wheel immediately spun rapidly. However, the clueless Chen Youzhi did not notice his elder brother's small action and instead pedaled even harder. Unexpectedly, the machine was very fragile. It suddenly broke a wire and stopped spinning under high speed.
0:21:7|0:21:13|At night, the [Chen Family Ancestral Hall] became lively, with the old men walking inside in groups of three or four.
0:21:20|0:21:25|In the ancestral hall, [Fang Zijing] nervously peeks through a small gap in the door curtain.
0:21:36|0:21:42|[Fang Zijing] ignored [Chen Yuniang] and turned around to pick up the letter on the table, walking to the sand table to read it.
0:21:55|0:22:13|Uncle Sanzu nodded in acknowledgment, greeted his own people, and sat in the main seat with the support of [Chen Yuniang]. Then he pointed to the chair beside him and asked, after saying that, [Chen Yuniang] looked at the villagers gathered in the hall.
0:22:29|0:22:47|The villagers looked at each other, even Old Zhao furrowed his brows. Chen Yuniang, seeing this, could only cast her gaze on her second brother. Chen Gengyun helplessly rolled his eyes at his sister, clapping half-heartedly. At this moment, Fang Zijing pushed out the sand table he had prepared earlier. Old Zhao couldn't help but sit up straight and take a look at the sand table.
0:23:27|0:23:34|Chen Er's wife just raised her hand and was stared back by [Chen Gengyun].
0:23:47|0:24:7|[Fang Zijing] walked towards the machine that had been prepared in advance. After [Chen Yuniang] extinguished all the candlesticks in the hall, [Fang Zijing] pulled down the switch. The large wheel, which had only turned when [Chen Youzhi] pedaled, suddenly began to spin rapidly, and the light bulbs hanging from the beams in the ancestral hall lit up one by one.
0:24:9|0:24:36|As soon as [Fang Zijing] finished speaking, the light bulb lit up abnormally. The broken connection sparked, the pointer on the instrument panel jumped to the maximum, and then the light bulbs burst one after another in the sound of electricity. Wires with sparks fell from the ceiling, sweeping off the candles on the altar, instantly igniting a flame. [Chen's two sons] rushed to the altar to put out the fire.
0:24:36|0:24:44|In the end, it was the tea brought by [Chen Yuniang] that saved the day. The other villagers had already fled the ancestral hall, with no one left interested in [Fang Zijing]'s foreign technology.
0:24:44|0:24:53|In the worried expression of [Chen Yuniang], she pursed her lips and slowly lowered her head, dishearteningly taking off the courtesy on her head, while Third Uncle walked behind [Fang Zijing] with a cold face.
0:25:1|0:25:21|In the ancestral hall, everyone left, leaving only [Fang Zijing] and the reluctant [Chen Yuniang]. [Fang Zijing] watched the receding crowd with a cold look in his eyes, the original frustration had long disappeared in the contemptuous hatred. He then put on his hat again and walked out without saying a word.
0:25:21|0:25:40|That day's chaos had long been forgotten by the simple villagers, and a new day began. The village was filled with the smell of fireworks, mothers were eating fresh fried dough sticks with their children by the roadside, and a shepherd boy was leading a donkey through the market. The main hall in the center of the market, the ancestral pharmacy of the [Chen family], was also open. It is now managed by [Chen Yuniang].
0:25:40|0:25:51|In the corner of the pharmacy, there is a shelf resembling a tree trunk, with trays full of medicinal herbs on the deep branches. [Chen Yuniang] glanced at the prescription, then firmly planted her feet and, with the strength of "four ounces moving a thousand pounds," began to move the wooden frame.
0:25:51|0:26:0|Accurately grabbing the herbs needed from the rotating tray and throwing them into the mortar, [Yang Luchan] suddenly burst into the pharmacy. Startled, [Chen Yuniang] turned around.
0:26:3|0:26:9|Chen Yuniang saw Yang Luchan looking clueless, took out a stack of copper coins from her waist pouch and placed them on the table.
0:26:40|0:27:0|[Chen Yuniang] pulled a piece of hemp rope from the top of the wheel above her head to prepare bandages for medicine. With a hint of inexplicable smile, she turned back and gestured for [Yang Luchan] to follow, pointing to the road directly opposite the medicine shop.
0:27:40|0:27:46|[Chen Yuniang] poured a cup of coffee and elegantly took a small sip.
0:27:58|0:28:9|Yang Luchan reached out his hand trying to grab Chen Yuniang, but Chen Yuniang agilely turned and stepped back, causing Yang Luchan to miss. After steadying her stance, she immediately performed the classic Chen-style Tai Chi move, "Reverse Rollback Arm."
0:28:9|0:28:18|[Yang Luchan] immediately assumed a defensive stance upon seeing the situation, striking out with a palm from a single hand. As [Chen Yuniang] retreated, she deflected [Yang Luchan]'s attacks skillfully, not allowing him to lay a finger on her.
0:28:18|0:28:28|Following that, [Chen Yuniang] took advantage of [Yang Luchan]'s swaying movement and elbowed him back to the edge of the terrace. Feeling unwilling to accept defeat, [Yang Luchan] charged forward again and grabbed [Chen Yuniang]'s arms, only to be countered by [Chen Yuniang] locking his vital acupoint.
0:28:44|0:28:52|Chen Yuniang didn't expect Yang Luchan to fall straight down without any resistance. However, when she looked down, Yang Luchan had disappeared without a trace.
0:28:52|0:29:7|In the village of Chenjiagou, there is a river with an inconspicuous bridge tunnel by the river, with a simple wooden door. When [Yang Luchan] opened his eyes, he found himself hanging upside down on the beam, with a bowl of nosebleed below, and a man with small glasses sitting in front of him.
0:29:23|0:29:29|Yang Luchan had no idea that the person wearing the small glasses at the entrance of Chen's village was the one carrying the bamboo hat.
0:29:51|0:30:15|Upon hearing these words, [Old Zhao] furrowed his brow and stared at [Yang Luchan] in front of him. He then tapped the hammer in his hand and approached, causing [Yang Luchan] to shiver in fear. [Old Zhao] pursed his lips disapprovingly, rolled his eyes, patted [Yang Luchan] on the shoulder, gave him a look of no chance, and walked towards the cave.
0:30:19|0:30:32|Old Zhao didn't look up, just busy with the things in his hands. Yang Luchan's face instantly dimmed, he hung his head and rubbed his headscarf without speaking for a long time.
0:30:32|0:30:39|[Old Zhao] hesitated for a moment, but eventually got up again and patted [Yang Luchan] on the shoulder, wiping away the fresh blood from his nose.
0:31:4|0:31:8|Old Zhao paid no attention to Yang Luchan's shouts. After exiting the bridge tunnel, he unexpectedly walked up the steep slope in a vertical manner. At night.
0:31:8|0:31:28|[Fang Zijing], dressed in Western-style formal wear, walked out of the ancestral hall with a melancholic expression. Behind him, [Chen Yuniang] wheeled out a phonograph. Ignoring her actions, [Fang Zijing] looked around in confusion before sitting on the steps at the door. [Chen Yuniang], wearing a plain Western-style dress, smilingly placed the needle on the record and sat down next to [Fang Zijing], lifting her skirt.
0:32:47|0:32:53|Fang Zijing, with nowhere to vent his anger, suddenly picked up the phonograph and smashed it to pieces. Then he walked down the steps and mocked himself.
0:33:2|0:33:22|After mocking Chen Yuniang, Fang Zijing disdainfully smirked, turned around without looking back, and walked out of the ancestral hall courtyard. Chen Yuniang stared blankly at the suddenly unfamiliar man in front of her, tears starting to well up in her eyes. Inside the ancestral hall, someone quietly hung themselves behind the big clock, silently watching this scene unfold. If Yang Luchan were here at this moment, he would surely be greatly shocked.
0:33:22|0:33:31|Because the man with the hanging golden hook officially saved [Old Zhao].
0:33:49|0:33:56|A discordant voice interrupted the hesitant [Chen Yuniang] as [Yang Luchan] fearlessly stood before him once again.
0:34:2|0:34:17|The moment the postman heard this, he immediately stuck his head out of the window, while the woman beside him hurriedly covered the child's eyes. The next second, [Yang Luchan] flew out of the post office without any warning.
0:34:25|0:34:34|Chen Yuniang blocked Yang Luchan's fist with her right arm, calmly pressed down on his arms with one hand, and chopped at his neck with the other hand.
0:34:34|0:34:46|Yang Luchan had no choice but to dodge and was then sent flying by Chen Yuniang's palm. Old Zhao, hiding in the crowd, frowned at the scene before him. Yang Luchan immediately stood up straight and stubbornly rushed towards Chen Yuniang again.
0:35:3|0:35:26|Taking a defensive stance cautiously, [Chen Yuniang] remained composed, suddenly catching [Yang Luchan]'s fist, then using a double push to make [Yang Luchan] stumble. With palms pressing straight towards [Chen Yuniang]'s vital point, [Chen Yuniang] smoothly grasped [Yang Luchan]'s hand, pulled back and twisted it, pushing him out. As [Yang Luchan] was still staggering backwards, [Chen Yuniang] leaped up, executing a solid ground kick towards [Yang Luchan]'s chest in a cross pattern.
0:36:30|0:36:42|Under the escort of two well-trained foreign soldiers, a young Western-looking woman walked into the yamen. With a cold smile on her face, she walked straight to [Magistrate Dao].
0:36:44|0:36:51|[Dong Ye] stood up with a hint of scrutiny in his eyes, fearless of the orders from the master.
0:37:19|0:37:31|Hearing what [Fang Zijing] pointed out, [Dong Ye] took small steps up the wooden stairs to a lookout tower, wanting to witness firsthand the power of the industrial revolution as he described.
0:37:31|0:37:41|[Fang Zijing] stood behind [Dong Ye] with confidence, his face showing the satisfaction of impending revenge. Meanwhile, [Clara] from the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution couldn't hide her inner pride and arrogance.
0:37:41|0:37:49|A huge object soon appeared in front of [Lord Dao Tai], towering two stories high with walls of bronze and iron, powered by a steam engine.
0:37:49|0:37:57|It's just like a moving castle. The scene shifts to outside the entrance of Chenjiagou Village, where it is pouring rain. Villagers are hurriedly packing up their stalls, wearing raincoats.
0:37:57|0:38:20|Yang Luchan squatted under a cart, hugging his knees in distress, while Old Zhao leaned against the door of a thatched cottage, puffing on a pipe and contemplating him. Chen Yuniang, holding an umbrella, came to observe the villagers' activities, and upon seeing Yang Luchan, she slowly stopped in her tracks. Yang Luchan, unaware of Chen Yuniang's arrival, shivered from the cold, only able to hug himself tightly and seek comfort in the bellyband embroidered by his mother.
0:38:27|0:38:47|[Yang Luchan] looked at the embroidered picture and secretly made up his mind. He quickly formulated a plan to enter the village, and the first step of entering the village was to break through the village entrance. At this time, the stalls outside the village entrance were bustling. Not far away, a pile of small grass stacks was neatly arranged. Suddenly, one of the grass stacks started to move mysteriously, slowly moving towards the village entrance. [Yang Luchan] thought no one noticed.
0:38:47|0:39:14|Moving towards the village with a haystack on his head, the middle-aged man sitting on the eaves at the village entrance, [Qinbo], was staring intently at the moving haystack. Just as [Yang Luchan] thought he had deceived everyone, [Qinbo] suddenly kicked the haystack, scattering it and sending [Yang Luchan] flying. He landed directly in a pile of hay at the village entrance. Refusing to back down, [Yang Luchan] raised his fist towards [Qinbo], but [Qinbo] grabbed his arm, pulled him back, and simultaneously pushed him out while headbutting his stomach. As [Yang Luchan] flew out, the winner was already clear.
0:39:14|0:39:45|The next day, [Yang Luchan] avoided the village entrance and circled around to approach the market from the side. Unexpectedly, a young warrior had been waiting there for a long time. Seeing the girl with twin ponytails standing in front of him, only reaching his chest, [Yang Luchan] felt a bit tongue-tied. The girl made the first move, grabbing [Yang Luchan]'s collar with both hands. However, [Yang Luchan] didn't want to engage and grabbed her arms, pulling her behind him. Strangely, no matter how hard [Yang Luchan] tried to break free, the girl could always grab onto his clothes. As [Yang Luchan] turned to leave, the girl caught him again. [Yang Luchan] kicked straight towards the girl's forehead, causing her to flinch in panic.
0:39:45|0:39:56|Taking advantage of [Yang Luchan]'s moment of hesitation, the girl kicked him directly in the chest, causing him to step back several steps. [Yang Luchan] held his chest for a while, unable to recover, while [Old Zhao] stood by with a pipe in his mouth, looking amused.
0:39:56|0:40:19|Seeing the girl lift a half-head-sized stone with one foot, she aimed sharply at [Yang Luchan]'s knee pit. [Yang Luchan] was hit and immediately bent one knee, lowering himself by half. Seizing the opportunity, the girl leaped up and stood directly on his shoulder. She used her ankle to clamp [Yang Luchan]'s head, forcing him to rotate continuously. Just as [Yang Luchan] was getting dizzy, she leaped up again, reversed 360 degrees, and kicked straight at [Yang Luchan]'s forehead, sending him flying once more.
0:40:20|0:40:31|After the girl landed lightly on the ground, she smiled and put away her moves. In fact, in the past 120 years, a total of 87 boxers have come to Chen Family Valley, of which 63 people heard that Chen Family Boxing is not passed on.
0:40:31|0:40:50|Automatically leaving, but 11 people were defeated at the village entrance, 5 people were knocked out at the market. However, [Yang Luchan] seemed like an indestructible cockroach, quickly planning his third round. The location of the third round was chosen at the archway, with the gatekeeper being Mahjong Sister. Mahjong Sister set up the table seriously, suddenly she threw the tiles down, flipped the table, and all the mahjong tiles flew towards [Yang Luchan].
0:40:51|0:41:2|[Yang Luchan] had no power to fight back against this blow and screamed as he flew out again. Except for those people from before, everyone else stopped at the archway. Now, besides the eight-fingered [Dong Ye] who sneaked into the village to do odd jobs,
0:41:2|0:41:13|Only [Yang Luchan] was left. At this moment, [Yang Luchan] lay on the warm grass, then sat up in the sunlight, excitedly demonstrating the martial arts he had learned during these days. Unbeknownst to him, [Old Zhao] appeared behind him.
0:42:4|0:42:7|[Old Zhao] woke up the dreamer with a single sentence, making [Yang Luchan] suddenly enlightened.
0:42:7|0:42:30|Villagers crowded around when [Yang Luchan] challenged Tofu Brother. The challenge took place in the city center, where Tofu Brother, the 12th generation of the Chen family's martial arts, demonstrated his skill by cutting a piece of tofu with a knife and catching it effortlessly with a piece of gauze. He then gestured towards [Yang Luchan] with the tofu in his hand.
0:42:32|0:42:47|[Yang Luchan] smiled kindly, then clenched his fist with one hand and aimed straight at the tofu. Tofu Brother dodged the attack by sidestepping, holding the tofu with one hand and blocking [Yang Luchan]'s arm with the other. Then, he took a few steps back, and using his scapula to directly hit [Yang Luchan]'s chest, sending him flying seven to eight meters away.
0:42:48|0:43:9|On the second-floor terrace, [Chen Yuniang] couldn't help but step forward to watch. [Yang Luchan] lifted his leg to kick at Tofu Brother's facade, only to be split open by Tofu Brother's palm. He then dismantled [Yang Luchan]'s moves in three or two moves, pushing him back several steps with a palm strike. When [Yang Luchan] came at him with a straight punch again, Tofu Brother caught his wrists with both hands, propping up the tofu with his right hand and using his left hand to turn [Yang Luchan]'s head, followed by a kick to his buttocks.
0:43:9|0:43:16|Old Zhao, who couldn't bear to watch any longer, quietly called out to [Yang Luchan], then knocked on the donkey's head with a smoking pipe. Upon hearing the sound, [Yang Luchan] immediately raised his head.
0:43:23|0:43:45|Old Zhao's words appeared, making [Yang Luchan] instantly confident. He raised the corners of his mouth and made a gesture as if offering fruits like a monkey. The old lady sitting nearby couldn't sit still anymore. As soon as the old lady's voice fell, she saw [Yang Luchan] quickly step back, then suddenly turned around with a palm pushing motion directly towards Tofu Brother. Tofu Brother was caught off guard by the sudden attack of the Chen family's boxing technique.
0:43:45|0:44:11|[Yang Luchan] was unable to use any follow-up moves after his hands and feet were restrained. Tofu was seen spinning rapidly in the palms of both, making it difficult to determine a clear winner. [Yang Luchan] employed the techniques previously used by Tofu Brother to resolve the crisis at hand, even using his scapula to press against Tofu Brother's cheek. Following Mahjong Sister's advice, [Yang Luchan] managed to break free from Tofu Brother's grasp with a lazy tie of his clothes. As Tofu Brother reached out to grab the tofu and simultaneously locked [Yang Luchan]'s neck with his knee.
0:44:11|0:44:33|Yang Luchan was overwhelmed and kicked in the stomach. He flipped in the air and fell to the ground. As he was getting up to counterattack, someone suddenly kicked him in the spine. Before Yang Luchan could react, he lunged towards Tofu Brother. Tofu Brother was hit and fell to the ground, dropping the tofu from his hands. Yang Luchan looked puzzled for a while, then picked up the tofu from the ground and placed it back in Tofu Brother's hands.
0:44:33|0:44:39|He then stood up and grinned, saying,
0:44:42|0:45:4|The tofu seller straightened up and couldn't help but laugh when he looked at the tofu in his hand. The chatter around gradually brought [Yang Luchan] back to reality, and he excitedly pushed through the crowd and ran off.
0:45:22|0:45:29|[Yang Luchan] ran to the big tree in the middle of the village, looked up at the watchtower built on top, and climbed up without hesitation.
0:45:38|0:45:45|He agilely climbed to the top of the wooden frame and anxiously looked down at the street below.
0:45:45|0:45:51|And [Chen Yuniang] looked up thoughtfully at him.
0:45:52|0:46:15|Below, [Old Zhao] seemed to be regretfully patting the wooden frame next to him, then he lowered his hat and sneakily ran away. Meanwhile, [Yang Luchan] with a nosebleed, his eyes also becoming unfocused, swayed and leaned against the wooden frame. He weakly closed his eyes, and the gushing nosebleed made him unable to stay conscious. He then fainted on the small watchtower.
0:46:28|0:46:47|[Old Zhao] knew he couldn't deceive [Chen Yuniang], so he arrogantly flipped his braid and walked away. At this moment, there was a commotion in the village. With the ground shaking, the tofu on the tofu stand trembled, birds fluttered anxiously in their cages, even the porcelain on the shelves was shaken down and smashed. The villagers screamed in panic.
0:46:47|0:47:12|Before [Chen Yuniang] could react, the monster mentioned by the villagers had already arrived at the village gorge. This was the Trojan brought by Claire, a fortress almost two stories high. The Trojan moved very slowly, but the metallic sheen emanating from it was extremely intimidating. Its kinetic energy all came from coal, so it was constantly shrouded in black smoke. Passing through layers of copper walls and iron barriers, one could see that the interior space was not small, with over a dozen operators working inside.
0:47:14|0:47:21|The foreign military officer shouted at the workers to increase their horsepower, while two workers were diligently pushing two iron rails onto the conveyor belt.
0:47:21|0:47:33|Unexpectedly, this guy can lay down tracks while moving. Soon, the foreign military officer received a message that they had arrived at Chen Family Valley. The puzzled and wary villagers approached without hiding their confusion.
0:47:33|0:47:56|Cautiously looking around, while Claire sat in the driver's seat with a cold face showing disdain and contempt, at this moment [Chen Yuniang] finally squeezed to the front of the crowd, looking at Troy with confusion. Although it temporarily stopped, the internal cooperation did not pause for a moment. Under the constant urging of the officer, the workers desperately sent coal into the boiler. As two soldiers skillfully turned the valve, the internal machinery started running again.
0:48:0|0:48:20|With ample energy provided by the burning coal, the gauge pointer moved to a very impressive position. Claire sneered and shifted the gear directly to the lowest, causing thick smoke to instantly spew out from the external steam hole. She disregarded the villagers surrounding Troy, tightly gripped the steering wheel, and continued to move forward. The villagers were greatly frightened by the sudden start of this monster.
0:48:22|0:48:36|Desperately running towards the village, [Chen Yuniang] decisively stayed behind to cover the retreat of the villagers. She maintained the evacuation route while keeping a close eye on the approaching Trojan. Fortunately, the Trojan was not very fast, and the villagers quickly escaped into the village. It stopped again a few yards away from the village gate.
0:48:36|0:48:54|Under the cover of white smoke, the lid on top of Troy suddenly opened to reveal a platform, and [Fang Zijing] stood on it, slowly appearing before everyone's eyes. He did not see [Chen Yuniang] at the foot of Troy, but instead looked down at the villagers hiding in the village, with a hint of restrained satisfaction as he opened the notice in his hand.
0:49:17|0:49:32|Facing the taunts of [Chen Youzhi], [Fang Zijing] sneered disdainfully. Suddenly, Clara moved the rightmost panel down, and as a row of lights above her head lit up, she confidently nodded to the soldier beside her. The soldier took the order and began to turn the massive gears behind the cockpit with force.
0:49:32|0:49:59|With a loud noise, the semicircular gates on both sides of Troy were opened, and the huge mechanical arm, filled with iron chains and gears, extended out. As the mechanical arm fully stretched out, what came into view for everyone was a giant steel monster, with a shovel in its left hand and an iron claw in its right hand, glaring at the villagers of Chenjiagou. [Chen Yuniang] stood calmly at the village gate, staring at Troy in front of her. Under the control of [Clare], Troy slowly rotated its body, extending the shovel towards the simple wooden village gate, and then...
0:49:59|0:50:9|With a sudden force, the wooden door shattered instantly. She didn't hide her arrogance at all, and with a cold smile, she flicked another switch, slowly raising the iron claw in her right hand, hanging directly above the house.
0:50:9|0:50:18|With Clara's manipulation again, the iron claws opened, piercing through the roof and grabbing a piece of debris. Faced with this massive machine, the villagers were powerless.
0:50:18|0:50:27|Can only scream and flee around. [Fang Zijing] looked disdainfully at everything in front of him, feeling extremely pleased. Until [Clara] was not satisfied with just destroying the house, and reached out his iron claws in front of [Yuniang],
0:50:27|0:50:33|He was flustered.
0:50:35|0:50:55|[Fang Zijing]'s attempt to stop [Claire] did not make her stop, while [Yuniang] glared and stood at the village entrance without giving way. [Claire] provocatively loosened her iron claws and threw all the rubble in front of [Yuniang], raising a cloud of dust. [Yuniang] raised her hand to shield her eyes, and after the dust settled, she looked at [Fang Zijing] without hesitation and rebuked him angrily.
0:50:56|0:51:12|[Fang Zijing] seemed to be moved, he lowered his eyes and hesitated with [Chen Yuniang] for a while, but in the end, he turned around and unbuttoned a button next to him. Then the platform he was standing on slowly descended, and the hooks on both sides of Troy were also retracted.
0:51:12|0:51:35|[Chen Yuniang] looked at the back of [Fang Zijing] as he walked away, feeling a mix of emotions. The villagers stood behind [Chen Yuniang], looking in awe at the strange creature before them. Even the slightest movement from Troy could send a shiver down the villagers' spines. The village entrance had been leveled, with only the ruins and a lingering notice haunting everyone's minds. In the next moment, [Chen Yuniang] rushed non-stop to the Chen family ancestral hall. Pushing open the doors, she found it already filled with distinguished guests.
0:51:35|0:51:42|However, these esteemed elders all lowered their heads in silence, with Third Uncle sitting upright and breathing deeply.
0:52:11|0:52:23|[Chen Yuniang] expressed her thoughts sternly, then walked out without looking back. The group of old men remained silent, looking like a bunch of sculptures, each with an indifferent expression. And the so-called leader who couldn't bear the responsibility in their mouths.
0:52:23|0:52:34|Old Zhao was still nowhere to be seen, only hanging upside down on the beams of the ancestral hall, quietly watching the scene. The construction of the railway began in full swing, with Troy guarding the village entrance.
0:52:34|0:52:42|The villagers dare not slack off at all, and the foreign soldiers stationed here are even more bored, taking pleasure in frightening the villagers on weekdays.
0:52:44|0:53:3|At this moment, the workers were disloyally moving explosives into Troy, then using roller skates to hoist them to the second floor. [Clara] vigilantly watched the workers until everything was done correctly, then turned to walk towards [Fang Zijing], who was directing the soldiers driving Troy, asking them to increase the horsepower to 340. Upon hearing this, [Clara] smiled and said that she had already given instructions for this matter.
0:53:11|0:53:19|[Clara] paused for a moment, then turned around with a smile to look at [Fang Zijing].
0:54:10|0:54:37|[Clara] picked up a thick operation manual from the office chair and handed it to [Fang Zijing]. Without looking back, she went downstairs. Meanwhile, by the bridge tunnel near the river, [Old Zhao] skillfully played with a phonograph, adjusting the needle onto the record. He teased while enjoying the music, closing his eyes deeply after taking a puff from his pipe. [Yang Luchan] lay on the bed beside, only waking up slowly upon hearing the music.
0:55:41|0:55:46|[Old Zhao] hurriedly got up and stopped [Yang Luchan] who was about to rush out, gesturing for him to sit back down.
0:55:55|0:56:1|Chen Yuniang smiled with a plan in mind. She first placed a piece of white paper in front of Yang Luchan.
0:56:2|0:56:18|He picked up a teapot and placed it on the paper again, using it to symbolize the Trojan guarding the village entrance. He lined up several chess pieces in front of the teapot to represent the foreign soldiers. The workers' bathing area was very rudimentary, just a large pot set up on the ground with some hot water heated up.
0:56:57|0:57:15|Yang Luchan, living up to expectations, successfully sneaked into the heart of Troy. At this moment, he is squatting in a corner, sketching the structures he observed on paper. Meanwhile, Fang Zijing, dressed in plain clothes, is carrying a thick manual as he walks towards the tent. And at this moment, Claire is holding a photo frame containing a picture of her and Fang Zijing, gazing quietly with a hint of unusual affection in her eyes.
0:57:22|0:57:39|[Clara] immediately tucked the photo frame into her clothes, then hastily closed the suitcase and stood up. Upon seeing the suitcase at her feet, [Fang Zijing] had a pleading look on his face, hoping she wouldn't leave. Little did they know that [Chen Yuniang] was observing their every move from atop the tent. [Clara] had no intention of staying.
0:57:45|0:57:52|Facing [Fang Zijing]'s plea once again, [Claire] smiled sadly. She knew her worth to [Fang Zijing] was just two cold iron rails.
0:57:57|0:58:10|At this moment, [Chen Yuniang]'s expression froze on her face, [Clare] also looked incredulous, several thoughts flashed through her mind. This sudden confession may be just a momentary impulse of [Fang Zijing], or it could be a long-standing secret crush.
0:58:28|0:58:34|He turned his head eagerly to look at [Clara], because everything changed after meeting [Clara], and he also experienced a feeling he had never felt before.
0:58:36|0:58:59|[Clara] stared blankly at the man who made her unable to control her emotions, especially when [Fang Zijing] said "You changed me." [Clara] couldn't help but grab his hand, they looked deeply into each other's eyes, their gaze gradually shifting from their faces to their lips. [Chen Yuniang] lay on the top of the tent with tears in her eyes, watching helplessly as the two below drew closer and closer, finally embracing and kissing passionately, even as tears streamed down [Chen Yuniang]'s cheeks.
0:58:59|0:59:6|She also kept her composure because there were more important things waiting for her to do, and then she leaped into the tent.
0:59:6|0:59:16|Upon hearing a strange noise, [Fang Zijing] alertly turned around and was stunned to see [Chen Yuniang]. With tears in her eyes, [Chen Yuniang] silently moved to the table and took the manual.
0:59:28|0:59:51|Old Zhao didn't manage to catch up in the end. The next day arrived quickly, with heavy rain pouring down and the sky dark and gloomy. Only a few people on the street hurried back to their houses, including the post office director. He was seen holding an oil-paper umbrella and a food box, walking quickly into the post office. As he wiped the water off and headed inside, a hand suddenly reached out from somewhere and locked the outer door.
0:59:51|0:59:55|Chen Yuniang strides forward and slams the manual in front of him.
1:0:8|1:0:18|Faced with the naked warning from [Chen Yuniang], the post and telecommunications director wiped a cold sweat helplessly, tremblingly opened the manual of Troy, and the first sentence that caught his eye was a warning for operation and use.
1:0:18|1:0:29|At the same time, under the bridge, [Old Zhao] with glasses carefully examined the homemade internal structure diagram of [Yang Luchan]'s Trojan. However, no matter how many times he turned the drawing around, he couldn't figure out which side was the correct direction.
1:0:35|1:0:44|[Yang Luchan] assists [Old Zhao] in flipping the drawing over, then takes out a stack of papers from his pocket and unfolds them.
1:0:52|1:0:57|After [Old Zhao] arranged the pattern in the correct order, the three-dimensional structure of Troy quickly formed in his mind.
1:1:2|1:1:7|He pinned one of the pictures on the stove frame, pointing to a vacant space ahead, saying to [Yang Luchan],
1:1:35|1:1:42|At this moment, [Yang Luchan] felt as if he were in the heart of Troy. He hurried through the passage, only to be scalded by the steam jetting out from the side, causing him to dance in pain.
1:1:55|1:2:4|[Old Changgong] used the blueprints posted everywhere and an empty space to build a simulated Troy in front of [Yang Luchan], and then led him around the so-called soldiers.
1:2:38|1:2:43|[Yang Luchan] held a iron rod and looked at the gears on the entire wall in confusion, feeling somewhat at a loss.
1:2:43|1:2:49|However, upon discovering that the two gears beneath his feet were turning, he raised the corners of his mouth and directly inserted the iron rod into the gap between the two gears.
1:3:0|1:3:28|The development of the situation ultimately matched [Yang Luchan]'s speculation. The gears rolled away the iron rod and continued to turn. The soldiers, who had disappeared, suddenly appeared, their spears pointing directly at [Yang Luchan]. [Yang Luchan] dodged the sticks of two soldiers, leaped up using the sticks as leverage, landed behind a soldier, and then pushed away the soldiers who had just rushed down the stairs. He demonstrated a move of flying over the eaves and walls, stepping on the surrounding gears to climb up. However, soldiers kept pouring in from upstairs and downstairs.
1:3:30|1:3:45|Upon seeing [Yang Luchan], he rushed forward. [Yang Luchan] kicked away the box at his feet in an attempt to stop the soldiers, but when the box was knocked open by the soldiers, a large amount of explosives spilled out. [Yang Luchan] grabbed a kerosene lamp and hurled it towards the nearby soldiers, but one of them split it in half with a stick, causing the lamp to fall to the ground and instantly ignite into flames.
1:3:45|1:4:4|After dealing with the last soldier, [Yang Luchan] cautiously observed his surroundings. Unexpectedly, an arm reached out from behind and grabbed [Yang Luchan] by the neck, dragging him backwards. The bare-chested Caucasian giant was a head taller than [Yang Luchan], with a robust and powerful physique. [Yang Luchan] managed to break free by twisting his pinky finger, then landed several punches on the giant's chest, but the giant remained unfazed.
1:4:4|1:4:29|Shortly after, the big man grabbed [Yang Luchan]'s fist, turned him upside down 180 degrees, and kicked him out. Before [Yang Luchan] could even cry out in pain, he struggled to pick up a wrench next to him and smashed it towards the big man's leg. Unexpectedly, the big man grabbed the wrench, lifted [Yang Luchan] by the collar, and slammed him around. With his eyes blurred, [Yang Luchan] weakly awaited the big man's final blow. Suddenly, an arrow accurately hit the steam pipe, releasing a large amount of hot steam towards both sides of the big man.
1:4:29|1:4:38|He covered his eyes in pain and kept retreating, [Yang Luchan] took the opportunity to use the carp stance to kick the big man out several steps, the big man with unsteady steps staggered for a few steps,
1:4:38|1:4:45|Plunging into the bottom of the boiler, he died instantly. [Yang Luchan] had no time to spare for anything else, joyfully greeted [Chen Yuniang] who saved him from danger.
1:4:56|1:5:7|The detailed shape of the hidden lock is depicted on the blueprint, at the same time, the little girl Zhao Di also came to Troy in front of [Yang Luchan] and [Chen Yuniang] acted separately to find the hidden lock.
1:5:9|1:5:34|[Yang Luchan] absentmindedly rubbed his head, and inadvertently lowered his head to discover something extraordinary. The fearless Zhaodi, like a newborn calf not fearing the tiger, picked up a large stone and threw it towards Troy. The window in front of Troy opened, emitting two strong beams of light that resembled eyes. [Yang Luchan] was completely puzzled and could only try to flip one of the switches. Suddenly, Troy lit up all over, with its claws raised abruptly.
1:5:37|1:5:49|[Yang Luchan] is having a great time at the moment, trying different ways to flip the switches inside, accidentally mimicking the exact Tai Chi gestures of the maid outside, which is quite comical.
1:5:49|1:6:1|On the other side, Fang Zijing ultimately failed to keep Claire, only able to carry her luggage to the door and wait with her for the carriage. The carriage soon arrived and stopped in front of them. Fang Zijing gallantly took Claire's hand and helped her into the carriage.
1:6:1|1:6:7|Fang Zijing felt very reluctant in the face of Claire's silence, and looked at her affectionately, saying that he would definitely go to her hometown to find her after the railway was built.
1:6:9|1:6:18|Clara could not hide her inner sadness, she glanced quietly at Fang Zijing beside her, and silently lowered her head, indicating that if Fang Zijing truly cared about their future together, he should walk with her.
1:6:19|1:6:31|While Fang Zijing and Claire were still entangled in their emotions, [Chen Yuniang] had already searched through the interior of Troy. She held up the blueprint and compared it over and over again, finally finding the exact same hidden lock in the center of the second floor.
1:6:31|1:6:42|However, a sudden turn of events disrupted their plan. A soldier struggled to crawl to the emergency button and pressed it with his last bit of strength. Troy instantly began to shimmer with a dazzling light.
1:6:43|1:6:52|Yang Luchan in the cockpit immediately rushed over upon hearing the sound, and together with Chen Yuniang, they checked the blueprint. After confirming it was correct, Chen Yuniang reached out her hand and turned the mechanism in the direction indicated on the blueprint.
1:6:52|1:7:4|With Chen Yuniang's movements, the buckles merged step by step according to the blueprint. When the last switch was merged, the gate suddenly opened, and the dense gears came into view, it seemed that this was the central system of Troy.
1:7:17|1:7:29|[Chen Yuniang] gritted her teeth and inserted the iron rod in her hand into the still rotating gears. As the gears jammed, the dial instantly reached its limit.
1:7:29|1:7:38|A large amount of steam gushed out, causing even the ground to tremble, and the scattered dynamite was terrifying. [Fang Zijing] knew it was bad, so he grabbed [Clara] and ran out.
1:7:38|1:7:50|At the same time, [Chen Yuniang] dragged [Yang Luchan] in another direction and ran, while [Fang Zijing] chose to go downstairs from the second floor to the ground floor through the back door. However, the explosives were lying in the cargo hold on the ground floor, already ignited by the trembling flames.
1:7:50|1:7:56|There could be an explosion at any time. [Chen Yuniang] is pulling [Yang Luchan] towards the top cockpit, planning to escape through the cabin door.
1:7:56|1:8:8|The fuse quickly burned to the end, and the bombs started to explode one after another, with dazzling sparks everywhere. [Yang Luchan] and [Chen Yuniang] fearlessly rushed forward, but [Clara] was not so lucky, as the strong impact from the explosion
1:8:8|1:8:16|Fang Zijing flung her to the side with a pole. He quickly turned around and helped the injured Claire limp outside.
1:8:16|1:8:24|At this moment, inside Troy, there were flames, thick smoke, and steam everywhere. At this rate, its own explosion was only a matter of time.
1:8:24|1:8:31|[Chen Yuniang] rushed into the cockpit with [Yang Luchan] to find the location of the cabin door, while the flames behind them kept reaching out, trying to engulf them.
1:8:31|1:8:43|[Fang Zijing] and Claire were the first to find the exit, but hesitated whether to jump down. [Chen Yuniang] and [Yang Luchan] had already been forced to jump down by the flames in the cockpit. As [Yang Luchan] and [Chen Yuniang] landed at the same time, the outer shell of Troy kept expanding.
1:8:43|1:8:54|Several rivets were sprayed out. Finally, unable to withstand the high temperature pressure, the internal core exploded first. [Yang Luchan] and [Chen Yuniang] desperately ran out, and on the way, they even remembered to pick up the provocative maid who was challenging Troy.
1:8:54|1:9:13|At one moment, metal parts scattered everywhere, and Troy exploded completely. The three were knocked down by the huge impact, and iron claws also descended from the sky, encircling them in the center until the last moment when [Fang Zijing] and Claire managed to escape, falling weakly to the ground. The final glory of Troy disappeared along with the splashing sparks, leaving only a pile of metal parts.
1:9:13|1:9:37|Under the iron claws, the kind-hearted [Yang Luchan] immediately protected the young Zhao Di, looking dirty and disheveled as he smiled sincerely at the unharmed Zhao Di. However, [Chen Yuniang] was knocked unconscious by the explosion's aftermath. [Yang Luchan] then lifted [Chen Yuniang]'s body and strode towards the village with Zhao Di. On the other side, [Fang Zijing] struggled to prop himself up, looking at the unprecedented confusion revealed in the ruins around him, as he tried to get up.
1:9:37|1:9:55|Knocked down again by the aftermath of the explosion, [Fang Zijing] stared with wide eyes at the repeated explosions of Troy in front of him, but he had no way to stop it. He knelt forward and took a few steps, looking at the remains of Troy, a hint of tears in his eyes. This was his only hope, ultimately destroyed in this accident.
1:10:0|1:10:19|Clara tried to get up but couldn't support her body. She weakly reached out to [Fang Zijing], who then realized her presence and rushed over to hold her in his arms.
1:10:19|1:10:25|However, Claire's chest was already soaked with blood, [Fang Zijing] was overwhelmed with grief, trembling as he covered her wound.
1:10:27|1:10:37|Clara weakly lifted her head and looked affectionately at [Fang Zijing], who tried to force a smile to comfort Clara.
1:10:37|1:10:56|After hearing the satisfactory answer, Claire joyfully held his hand and affectionately rubbed her cheek against his, [Fang Zijing] also looked at Claire in his arms with unprecedented tenderness. Claire's movements became slower and slower, and finally she tilted her head and fell into his arms. [Fang Zijing] panicked, trembling as he shook Claire's body but received no response.
1:11:1|1:11:20|After the roar, [Fang Zijing] once again fell into deep powerlessness. Now the only thing he could do was to hold the still-warm body of Claire tightly in his arms. On the other side, the door of [Chen Yuniang]'s house was opened, and several elders filed out. At this moment, no one knew what had happened, they could only watch alertly towards the village entrance.
1:12:12|1:12:17|A man in a white robe walked out of the ancestral hall and went straight to [Yang Luchan].
1:12:17|1:12:20|This is the uncle laborer mentioned by [Yang Luchan].
1:13:19|1:13:35|The group prepared for the battle, with [Chen Changxing] standing on the steps, looking solemnly at everyone. The villagers always followed the orders of the sect leader first, so they immediately began to prepare. They silently packed their bags, lined up, and left the village. However, the children, who did not understand what was happening, were reluctant to leave home and cried loudly.
1:13:46|1:13:53|At this moment, [Chen Village] showed an extraordinary unity, and the steamed bun shop had already prepared and distributed food to the villagers in an orderly manner.
1:14:19|1:14:39|Soon the villagers created some special weapons. They mixed coal ash, tea leaves, cow dung, and camphor with water, stewed them into a paste over a high flame, poured them into molds, dried them, wrapped them in tobacco leaves, lit them on fire, and thick white smoke instantly filled the air. The smoke contained arsenic trioxide, which, when inhaled, would cause slight dizziness and blurred sense of direction, and in severe cases, hallucinations.
1:14:39|1:14:47|Villagers covered their mouths and noses, walking around with burning smoke blocks. Soon the entire village was shrouded in thick smoke, making it impossible to see the road.
1:14:47|1:14:51|This is the first tactic employed by [Chen Changxing], using feints to disrupt the opponent's strategy.
1:14:51|1:15:1|Soon, [Fang Zijing] led the Qing soldiers to break into [Chen Family Valley]. He slowly led his horse towards the ruins of Troy not far away, a moment that reminded him of his hatred towards [Chen Family Valley].
1:15:1|1:15:10|[Chen Gengyun] stood on the top of the watchtower, quietly observing the movements of the Qing soldiers below. He saw them holding long spears, walking cautiously in a row of four towards the street.
1:15:10|1:15:12|Half of the streets and alleys are already filled with Qing soldiers in the blink of an eye.
1:15:12|1:15:25|Chen Changxing saw that the time was right, so he threw the stones in his hand towards the wind vane. As the wind vane turned, Tofu Brother, who received the signal, leaped lightly onto the roof holding a bunch of luohan fruits. The smoke began to take effect, and Fang Zijing instinctively covered his mouth and nose.
1:15:26|1:15:47|The smoke made the visibility extremely low, and although the soldiers were vigilant and looking around, they still couldn't see that the doors and windows on both sides of the streets and alleys had quietly opened. This was the second strategy: using yin to control yang. Suddenly, countless watermelons, mangoes, and other fruits attacked from all directions, causing the soldiers to panic. While the fruits were not lethal, their impact was not to be underestimated. Some soldiers even lost their front teeth.
1:15:47|1:15:58|The triplet sisters held lotus seeds on the second-floor terrace and squeezed them out, shooting them in unison at the soldiers below. The soldiers were bombarded by the lotus seeds and were momentarily at a loss on how to dodge them. After the lotus seeds were shot out, ...
1:15:58|1:16:18|Villagers immediately threw prepared corn, radishes, and other items at the soldiers. Before the soldiers could react, Tofu Brother unleashed a powerful move, lifting his leg and flinging the tree branch in his hand towards the soldiers' legs, causing the loquat fruits on it to shoot out and knock down a group of soldiers. Meanwhile, Chen Yuniang's skills were even more amazing, as she created a slingshot as tall as a person and exerted all her strength to pull the bowstring taut.
1:16:18|1:16:30|At the moment she released the bowstring, three pumpkins shot out like thunder, knocking down a group of soldiers. The villager who had just thrown the fruits agilely flipped over the wall, picked up a nearby stool, and smashed it towards the soldiers.
1:16:30|1:16:41|The dual attack of smoke and fruits hit the soldiers hard, leaving them dizzy and unable to resist. [Chen Youzhi]'s moves made it even worse for the soldiers, as she skillfully used her techniques.
1:16:41|1:16:52|Casually flicking the eggs in the basket, the fresh eggs instantly smeared the face of the soldier, making it impossible for him to even open his eyes. And with the Chen-style martial arts, Brother Tofu easily knocked down several soldiers in just a few moves.
1:16:52|1:17:5|Villagers standing on the grass platform picked up the fruits in the baskets and threw them down continuously, but for the first time, they didn't hit anyone. The general in golden armor stood cold-faced, dodging the thrown fruits, and then drew his long sword to chop the flying fruits into pieces.
1:17:8|1:17:21|The soldier who received the order immediately calmed down and started shooting around. The villagers were forced to flee as the fruits were no match for real weapons. Unfortunately, one villager failed to escape and was shot directly.
1:17:23|1:17:30|Chen Changxing didn't hesitate, he rushed straight down from the watchtower, and before Old Zhao fell off the high platform, he grabbed the back of his neck and pulled him back.
1:17:31|1:17:37|Fang Zijing suppressed his hatred and gritted his teeth as he rode forward on his horse while soldiers filled the gaps with bullets.
1:18:3|1:18:23|[Chen Yuniang] remained calm in the face of danger, with her hands on her hips blocking the entrance to the ancestral hall. Even when the soldier's long spear was already at her neck, she did not back down. Meanwhile, [Fang Zijing] had nothing but anger in his eyes, no longer showing the warmth of the past. Just as the soldiers were about to leave after subduing [Chen Yuniang], she took the initiative to grab the spear at her neck and directly hit the soldier's forehead, then swiftly dealt with the surrounding people using her unique Tai Chi martial arts.
1:18:23|1:18:42|Only [Yang Luchan] silently observed the movements around [Chen Yuniang]. He leaped down from the watchtower, landing directly on the shoulders of two soldiers. Unable to bear the weight, the soldiers fell to one side. [Yang Luchan] then deftly opened the soldier's long spear upon landing, demonstrating the formidable Chen family boxing techniques, instantly defeating a group of opponents.
1:18:42|1:18:53|On the other side, [Chen Yuniang] acted decisively, and the soldiers couldn't get close for half a day. Seeing this, the general snatched a soldier's long spear and aimed it at [Chen Yuniang].
1:18:56|1:19:5|[Yang Luchan] only had time to open his arms to shield [Chen Yuniang], but was shot through the left shoulder, leaving a bloody wound.
1:19:10|1:19:19|The dark muzzles lined up in a row, all aimed at [Chen Yuniang] and [Yang Luchan]. At this moment, Chen Changxing flew down and threw a string of corn forward, instantly blocking all the bullets.
1:19:20|1:19:28|Third Uncle quickly hid behind the wall and also turned [Chen Youzhi], who was standing foolishly, around. Chen Changxing then made the final move: the unity of heaven and man, only to see [Fang Zijing] wave his hand.
1:19:30|1:19:43|The soldiers were ordered to stab Chen Changxing with their guns, but Chen Changxing grabbed the gun with one hand, slid his hand to the end of the gun, and then elbowed a soldier down. He stepped out a Tai Chi Bagua formation, skillfully turned the long spear with mysterious techniques, and knocked down the crowd again with the butt of the gun.
1:19:43|1:19:53|For Old Zhao and others like him, dealing with a group of unruly soldiers is as easy as pie, but his true purpose is not in killing, but in protecting a pure land.
1:19:53|1:20:2|The soldiers couldn't keep up with the ghostly speed of [Chen Youzhi]. Wherever his shadow passed, all they could see were fallen soldiers. Before the soldiers could even load their bullets, the guns had already slipped from their hands.
1:20:2|1:20:9|[Chen Youzhi], unarmed, effortlessly maneuvered between the army with his own strength, sweeping through thousands of soldiers wherever he went.
1:20:9|1:20:16|The soldiers held their long spears nervously on guard, but no one knew who [Chen Youzhi] would appear next to in the next second.
1:20:16|1:20:28|Facing the long spears thrusting towards him by three soldiers simultaneously, [Chen Youzhi] calmly extended his hand and deftly flicked the weapons away, while delivering a series of palm strikes that sent the three men flying. Before long, the courtyard in front of the ancestral hall was filled with soldiers lying on the ground, clutching their heads and wailing.
1:20:28|1:20:39|Without a trace of blood, [Chen Youzhi] raised two long spears and used internal force to deeply break and throw them out. Then he leaped up with force and directly pressured the general, who had not yet had time to raise his long sword.
1:20:39|1:20:50|[Chen Youzhi] was kicked off the horse by a kick. In the end, [Chen Youzhi] locked his gaze on [Fang Zijing], the result of this battle caught [Fang Zijing] off guard, facing [Chen Youzhi] at this moment made him extremely uneasy.
1:20:52|1:21:2|[Chen Youzhi] once again leaped up, directly mounting [Fang Zijing]'s horse and facing him. [Fang Zijing] was so scared that he kept leaning back. By this time, the Qing soldiers were already exhausted, with no more room for resistance.
1:21:2|1:21:9|The villagers took the opportunity to rush forward and drive the soldiers out. Facing the cold and frosty Chen Youzhi, Fang Zijing became more and more flustered and pretended to be calm as he spoke.
1:21:10|1:21:20|[Chen Youzhi] paid no attention to [Fang Zijing]'s feeble explanation. He grabbed the hem of [Fang Zijing]'s waist and threw him back, causing [Fang Zijing] to fly out in a sorry state.
1:21:20|1:21:31|After landing, he slid forward for a long distance, and finally the Qing soldiers helped [Fang Zijing] out of the village like a bereaved dog. Led by [Chen Youzhi], the villagers walked out with victorious steps.
1:21:31|1:21:41|Everyone's face was filled with a happy smile, [Yang Luchan] propped up his body to watch the whole process. After everything settled down, he couldn't hold on any longer and fainted with his head tilted to one side.
1:21:42|1:21:48|The poison of the Three Flowers Gathering on the top, combined with the consecutive fights and the wound piercing through the shoulder, puts [Yang Luchan] in a critical condition.
1:21:49|1:21:56|The village has returned to its former tranquility, with [Yang Luchan] bound on a stretcher in the Chen family ancestral hall, his slightly rising chest reminding everyone that he is still alive.
1:22:28|1:22:35|Third Uncle Zhao frowned and looked at Chen Changxing beside him. Chen Changxing stood up and looked at the family members in the room with his hands behind his back.
1:22:50|1:22:57|Third Uncle Zhao looked sternly at the clan members, then glanced at [Yang Luchan] who was tied up like a rice dumpling.
1:23:35|1:23:45|Third Uncle was furious when he heard this.
1:23:54|1:24:0|Chen Changxing made a bow to the offerings in front of the table.
1:24:1|1:24:5|He turned around and looked at Third Uncle with a pleading expression.
1:24:56|1:25:6|Chen Yuniang was shocked and quickly walked up to Chen Changxing, whispering to him.
1:25:11|1:25:31|Seeing that You Zhi had taken out the ancestral treasure sword, [Chen Yuniang] understood her father's intention in a flash. She stood at the door, looking into the breeze, and listened to [Yang Luchan]'s painful gasps, lost in thought. Waves of memories flooded back, filling [Chen Yuniang]'s heart to the brim. After a long while, she turned around and looked at the unconscious [Yang Luchan].
1:25:31|1:25:42|Upon their first meeting, [Yang Luchan] was knocked over by [Fang Zijing]'s terrible driving skills. While [Yang Luchan] was dizzy and disoriented, [Fang Zijing] remained indifferent. Later, out of impatience with [Yang Luchan]'s inquiries about the Chen family's martial arts, she casually pointed in a random direction.
1:25:42|1:25:46|Attempting to break free, [Yang Luchan] showed his most innocent smile to himself at that moment.
1:25:46|1:25:50|Later, [Yang Luchan] realized he had been deceived and ran to the teahouse to question.
1:25:50|1:26:2|He had to reluctantly make a move, more than once leaving [Yang Luchan] in a sorry state, but he always kept his original intention without backing down. At that time, [Fang Zijing] angrily smashed the phonograph on the spot, cutting off the last bond between them, as [Fang Zijing] disregarded their past friendship.
1:26:2|1:26:13|During the destruction of the village by Troy, it was [Yang Luchan] who fought alongside her to save the villagers. And now, [Yang Luchan] lies here on the brink of death, all because he took a fatal bullet for [Fang Zijing].
1:26:13|1:26:23|At this moment, Third Uncle drew his precious sword, pointing it directly at [Yang Luchan], while the unconscious [Yang Luchan] was unaware that his fate had already been decided. With this in mind, [Chen Yuniang]'s expression became extremely resolute as she looked at [Yang Luchan],
1:26:23|1:26:32|There was a hint of unusual affection in his eyes.
1:26:37|1:26:42|[Chen Youzhi] closed his eyes and let out a sigh, with a faint smile appearing at the corner of his mouth.
1:26:43|1:26:51|The room was filled with people who dared not make a sound, quietly watching this father and daughter.
1:26:52|1:27:15|[Chen Youzhi] lifted his foot and walked out, after [Chen Yuniang] decisively settled the matter, she also followed [Chen Youzhi] out of the ancestral hall, leaving everyone in the room stunned. Third Uncle looked outside in shock, unable to come to his senses for a while. Eventually, he sighed with a furrowed brow and put the precious sword back on the altar. In this way, [Yang Luchan] not only learned the Chen family boxing to save his own life, but also unexpectedly won the beauty.
1:27:15|1:27:23|Chen Yuniang hurriedly rushed out of the ancestral hall, but suddenly stopped in her tracks, then she turned back again to calm her emotions at the moment. Meanwhile,
1:27:23|1:27:30|In front of Lord Dao Tai, there is an apparatus with internal gears rotating and driving a pointer to swing regularly.
1:28:5|1:28:12|And [Fang Zijing] paid no attention to the scolding from the magistrate, only clenching his fists tightly.
1:28:14|1:28:26|At this moment, Chenjiagou is very lively, with the streets hung with festive lanterns. The procession, carrying the wedding flags high, joyfully passes through the market center, while villagers gather on both sides of the road curiously looking on.
1:28:26|1:28:33|Everyone's face was filled with joyful smiles, while [Chen Yuniang] was dressed in a gorgeous wedding gown, covered with a green veil sitting in the middle of the sedan chair procession.
1:28:33|1:28:37|Mischievous [Zhao] couldn't help but lift the sedan curtain.
1:28:39|1:28:57|Chen's second sister-in-law hurriedly pulled Zhao Di aside, then sneakily glanced at [Chen Yuniang], lowered the curtain, and through the veil vaguely saw [Chen Yuniang] with her eyes downcast, showing no joy on her wedding day. At the village entrance, lanterns were hung and even on the remnants of Troy, there were red strings symbolizing happiness.
1:28:57|1:29:2|Uncle Qin was as usual guarding the village entrance, but unexpectedly, two uninvited guests arrived at this moment.
1:29:2|1:29:10|The leading man wore a bamboo hat that covered most of his face, only revealing his slightly pursed lips. His robe was casually draped over his shoulders, giving him a disheveled look.
1:29:10|1:29:22|The woman's face was hidden under a black veil, with delicate features and a cold demeanor. Qingbo was originally playing mahjong, but as soon as he sensed the presence of the two, he immediately put away his smile and turned his head to look sideways.
1:29:22|1:29:26|The next moment, [Old Zhao] was already standing with his hands behind his back, blocking the way for the two at the village gate.
1:29:26|1:29:33|However, they continued to move forward calmly until they were only two meters away from [Old Zhao] before stopping.
1:29:42|1:29:55|The man's lips curled up without any retreat, [Old Zhao] saw this and showed a polite smile, but there was no slack in his heart. He immediately opened his posture and made the starting gesture of the Chen Family Fist.
1:29:55|1:30:4|The man also took two steps back, slowly sinking down with his hands on his knees, forming a sturdy horse stance. The woman remained standing quietly on the side, without any movement.
1:30:4|1:30:14|Suddenly the man lifted both feet, brought his legs together, pushed his hands back, and with a leap of force flew towards [Old Zhao]. [Old Zhao] immediately leaned back to dodge, narrowly avoiding being grazed by the man's shoe sole on his cheek.
