0:0:30|0:0:41|In the early 1940s, in a remote village in southwestern China, there was a secluded village called Changshou, where people lived long lives and had their own rules, named after the emperor of the Qing Dynasty.
0:0:41|0:0:47|The villagers have long lived under the 72 ancestral rules, suppressed but orderly.
0:0:47|0:1:2|Ever since the appearance of [Niu Jieshi], there have been earth-shaking changes in the village. On the dusty mountain road, a four-wheeled carriage is speeding forward, the bumpy road causing the chain hanging from the back of the carriage to constantly collide. Several big men standing on the carriage, wearing black masks,
0:1:2|0:1:14|Holding a stick, Niu Jieshi fiercely strikes the sack hanging in the center. At this moment, a motorcycle honks its horn as it approaches from the corner, the driver continuously screaming, while the man sitting beside him lowers his head and tightly grips the handle.
0:1:15|0:1:21|Also afraid, he shouted loudly, and the people on the cart looked in confusion towards the direction the motorcycle was heading.
0:1:21|0:1:40|Following that, the cart stopped by the roadside, and four people on the cart lifted the sack to the edge of the cliff and threw it forward with force. At that moment, a scream came from the sack, followed by a rapid roll down the hillside. The four individuals glanced back, then turned and walked away. Meanwhile, an out-of-control motorcycle came straight down, with no time to evade.
0:1:40|0:1:42|It happened to hit the sack falling on the road.
0:1:43|0:1:47|The motorcycle didn't stop, but instead rushed towards the cliff.
0:1:47|0:1:54|At the last moment, the half-broken wheel of the carriage finally stopped at the edge of the cliff, and the two of them took a deep breath with their mouths wide open.
0:1:54|0:2:2|The man got off the motorcycle first, looked back, then bent down to pick up a stone, and cautiously approached the moving sack.
0:2:2|0:2:5|The motorcycle driver stood far away, carefully observing the situation.
0:2:6|0:2:16|The man slowly bent down to untie the sack, revealing a person with cotton stuffed in their mouth. The person pushed the sack open and knelt up, emitting muffled groans.
0:2:55|0:3:7|Following that, [Niu Jieshi] stood up and walked towards the edge of the cliff. The intense pain under his feet contorted his entire face, and he bit the hemp rope tied to his wrist. The man stood up, dropped the stone, and turned to look.
0:3:9|0:3:13|After saying that, he spread his arms and ran down the side path in a swaying manner.
0:3:13|0:3:17|The man grinned and looked at this strange person.
0:3:17|0:3:23|At this moment, [Niu Jieshi], like a monkey out of the mountains, even on the rugged path, still bouncing, rushing down the mountain.
0:3:24|0:3:27|After a while, he arrived at a hill not far from the village.
0:3:27|0:3:35|[Niu Jieshi] stood in place, overlooking the familiar surroundings, with houses of varying heights surrounded by mountains on all sides.
0:3:35|0:3:39|He then bent down, picked up a stone by his foot, and threw it down with force.
0:3:39|0:3:47|After a while, [Niu Jieshi] swaggered down the mayor's path, and the villagers carrying water buckets saw him and ran back home as if they had seen a ghost.
0:3:50|0:3:56|The painter on the high place heard Niu Jieshi's voice and immediately grabbed the rope to climb to the roof.
0:3:56|0:3:59|At this moment, [Niu Jieshi] hummed a tune as he strolled through the streets of the small town.
0:3:59|0:4:3|The villagers immediately picked up the child and closed the door when they saw him.
0:4:28|0:4:31|The old man in bed kept reaching out towards the bedside.
0:4:58|0:5:6|Niu Jieshi walked into the courtyard, and when the neighbors saw him, they all hurriedly hid in their homes. However, a group of young people came over aggressively.
0:5:28|0:5:33|Niu Jieshi was kicked out and fell into the arms of the person opposite, then grabbed a stone.
0:6:25|0:6:33|Four people lifted [Niu Jieshi] to leave, and at this moment, the ground began to tremble more and more violently, causing the onlookers hiding around to look around in alarm.
0:6:33|0:6:41|[Niu Jieshi] looked up and saw a huge crack suddenly appear on the peak of the distant mountain. The flying rocks kept hitting every part of the town.
0:6:41|0:6:44|Villagers screamed and ran around holding their heads.
0:6:44|0:6:48|At this moment, the giant rock on the mountaintop also started rolling towards the town.
0:6:48|0:6:53|The young man standing in place was about to escape, but was pulled to the ground by [Niu Jieshi] lying on the ground.
0:6:53|0:7:2|He crawled over and pressed the young man tightly.
0:7:6|0:7:19|After speaking, [Niu Jieshi] turned to look around, and a giant rock from the mountaintop came rushing towards them menacingly. The screen instantly plunged into darkness, with only a cloud of dust rising. The words "Killing Lives" gradually appeared on the screen.
0:7:25|0:7:38|The man who had a chance encounter with [Niu Jieshi] before, was now walking hurriedly on the road. He kept wiping his hands covered in blood with a piece of paper, then quickly ran into a yard and pushed open a door.
0:8:1|0:8:10|The dean gestured to the person who was serving on the side to bathe, and saw that person reluctantly came to a dusty signboard and blew on it, then he continued speaking.
0:8:30|0:8:40|Several days later, the man's figure appeared on the rugged mountain road. He was seen carrying a large bundle in his hands and a bulging luggage on his back, carefully moving along the top of the mountain, clinging to the rocks.
0:8:40|0:8:59|When he saw the nearby Changshou Town, Niu Jieshi smiled and whistled involuntarily. At this moment, the sound of a music box suddenly came from the valley, a hint of doubt flashed in his eyes. He followed the sound down, and what came into view was a crudely made coffin with a music box on top that kept spinning.
0:8:59|0:9:5|He slowly placed the large bundle in his hand aside and squatted down carefully, looking at [Niu Jieshi] lying inside with half-open eyes.
0:9:5|0:9:9|Next, he patted Niu Jieshi's face with the back of his hand and shouted.
0:9:10|0:9:15|Lying inside, [Niu Jieshi] still had his eyes half open, but his face slowly turned away.
0:9:15|0:9:20|The man shrank back in fear, then reached out to push his face back into place.
0:9:20|0:9:26|When he set foot on the road to Changshou Town again, there was an extra burden on his back, [Niu Jieshi].
0:9:26|0:9:32|Before leaving, he looked back at the huge rock supported by pillars behind him, then continued on towards Changshou Town.
0:9:32|0:9:35|Not long after, the man arrived at a courtyard carrying [Niu Jieshi] on his back.
0:9:36|0:9:44|Inside are many goat skulls hanging, with two pots standing on the ground, various animal skulls either soaking in the pots or drying on wooden boards nearby.
0:9:44|0:9:51|At the entrance, a cow skull is boiling in the water, and the interior structure is peculiar, filled with narrow staircases.
0:9:51|0:9:54|The man walked through the aisle with heavy footsteps.
0:9:58|0:10:2|The surroundings were silent, and the man had to carry [Niu Jieshi] down the stairs.
0:10:2|0:10:8|Due to the dark lighting, he missed a step and fell down the stairs, landing on the second floor landing.
0:10:8|0:10:18|[Niu Jieshi], hanging on the stairs, remained motionless in the corner. An old man who heard the noise walked over, looked up, and saw [Niu Jieshi] with half-open eyes staring straight at him.
0:11:4|0:11:11|After understanding the situation, the man carried [Niu Jieshi] on his back, opened the door and walked out. Not long after walking, he heard the sound of bells nearby.
0:11:11|0:11:18|While passing through another small path, a stone fell from behind. The man turned back to look and continued walking forward.
0:11:18|0:11:23|The entire Changshou Town was quiet, with men wandering through the alleys.
0:11:23|0:11:36|At this moment, the familiar sound of a bell rang from above. The man looked up at the roof, then continued to carry Niu Jieshi forward. A faint light shone through the dim stone passage, and the man turned to look at the person on his back, his face full of doubt.
0:11:36|0:11:41|Not long after, Niu Jieshi arrived at the open space in front of the ancestral hall. He looked around and shouted:
0:11:48|0:11:55|The man looked towards the voice coming from the crack of the door, and a figure flashed by from inside. He immediately carried [Niu Jieshi] on his back and walked to the door.
0:12:2|0:12:6|The Doctor looked down at the iron chain and lock hanging on the door after hearing the young man's words.
0:12:6|0:12:15|He picked it up and looked at the keyhole, and a key appeared before his eyes, which was actually fished out from [Niu Jieshi]'s neck, and the two matched perfectly.
0:12:15|0:12:19|He then opened the door and placed [Niu Jieshi] on the counter.
0:12:19|0:12:25|Next, the [Doctor] knelt beside and placed his hands together, pressing hard on [Niu Jieshi]'s abdomen.
0:12:30|0:12:37|The doctor moved his folded hands up and pressed them down again, his eyes fixed on Niu Jieshi's pale face.
0:12:37|0:12:40|At this moment, the key around the neck caught the attention of [Doctor].
0:12:40|0:12:45|At the same time, a group of people wearing cloaks and carrying torches were hurrying along the road.
0:12:45|0:12:49|[Doctor] hung the key around his neck and sat on the ground with his butt.
0:12:54|0:12:58|Niu Jieshi, with a pale face, still half-opened his eyes, showing no signs of life.
0:12:58|0:13:3|At this moment, a bell rang outside the ancestral hall, and [Doctor] immediately stood up and ran out.
0:13:3|0:13:12|Seeing the [Mayor] outside the ancestral hall, he paused for a moment, then walked down the stairs. The figure in a cloak holding a torch stood at the door, quietly observing the unfamiliar man in front of him.
0:13:20|0:13:26|[Mayor] walked forward expressionless, took a few steps, and [Doctor] approached him, getting close to his reddened right eye, and took a look.
0:14:5|0:14:25|You must carry him back. That night, the [Doctor] brought [Niu Jieshi] to the valley. The spring water in the valley flowed continuously towards the distance. [Niu Jieshi] lay on a large rock with his belly exposed. The [Doctor] was wiping his abdomen, then turned to take out a small curved knife from his bag, looking at it for a long time.
0:14:25|0:14:38|His eyes showed determination as he turned on the overhead light and squatted down to pat Niu Jieshi's face. The small curved knife slowly approached and pierced Niu Jieshi's abdomen, sliding straight down.
0:14:38|0:14:53|The doctor propped one hand on his belly, carefully watching the path of the curved knife, which extended from the abdomen to the navel. Then he stretched out his hands and forcefully pulled the belly apart. The torchlight reflected on the doctor's face, but little did he know what was just nearby.
0:14:53|0:15:1|A stranger in a coat is silently observing everything, holding a pocket watch in his hand.
0:15:1|0:15:12|Early the next morning, [Doctor] threw a fishing line onto the outer wall of Changshou Town, then he struggled to climb up by pulling the rope. Sitting on the wall, he panted heavily and silently observed the situation in Changshou Town.
0:15:12|0:15:18|A group of people wearing long cloaks were seen heading towards the same place, not far away.
0:15:29|0:15:33|The person in a cloak is discussing about Niu Jieshi.
0:15:33|0:15:38|At this moment, the [Doctor] hiding behind the wall cautiously peeks out, observing their movements carefully.
0:15:38|0:15:46|Hearing a noise behind him, [Doctor] looked back in panic, only to see the person wearing a military cap and armor immediately turn and run.
0:15:46|0:15:50|The doctor hurriedly followed and caught up with the person, then arrived at a small door.
0:16:0|0:16:14|The boy pointed and laughed at the key on [Doctor]'s chest. [Doctor] smiled, raised his hand, took off the key and held it in front of the child. The child reached out to grab it, and he leaned back and retreated.
0:16:14|0:16:17|The boy, angry after hearing this, started a fight but was captured by [Doctor].
0:16:25|0:16:30|He smiled, turned around, unzipped the backpack behind him, and pulled out a small collapsible stand.
0:16:30|0:16:37|Then, he picked up the stethoscope from the top layer, brought it to the boy's ear, and placed the other end on his own chest.
0:16:49|0:16:54|Upon hearing this, [Niu Jieshi] wiped the silly grin off his face and immediately turned serious.
0:16:54|0:17:0|He then slowly raised his hand and pointed towards the window inside the house, turning around to look in the direction he was pointing.
0:17:0|0:17:12|With the camera moving, gradually extending from the window to the entire appearance of Changshou Town, grey stone buildings cover every corner, and everyone in the town is doing their own thing in an orderly manner.
0:17:12|0:17:22|At the same time, all the women in the town were standing on the rooftops drying their clothes, banging their bamboo tubes to walk through every alley, reminding the surrounding residents.
0:17:28|0:17:39|Residents standing next to the wooden barrels lined up one by one to fetch water. The mountain spring water in the ditch never stopped flowing, continuously sent to various places through the dark and narrow passage.
0:17:39|0:17:47|The flow diverges and converges again, the memories of youth also rewind with the direction of the water, the spring water at that time was as clear and transparent as a mirror.
0:17:48|0:18:4|Flowing from the underground stone passage to various places for residents to use, the water gradually becomes calm. A graceful reflection appears on the water surface, and the scene shifts indoors. A woman with long hair, wrapped in a towel around her lower body, water droplets slowly sliding down from her hair onto her soft abdomen.
0:18:4|0:18:12|She slowly poured the essential oil onto her hands and rubbed it onto her back, squinting her eyes to enjoy the fragrant smell that enveloped her body.
0:18:12|0:18:17|Rubbing his hands gently, completely unaware that someone had already stopped behind him.
0:18:24|0:18:29|[Niu Jieshi] was puzzled and turned to look, only to see the woman seizing the opportunity to escape, but he quickly caught her and held her in his arms.
0:19:8|0:19:17|[Niu Jieshi] quietly slipped into the old man's bedside during the chaos. He held a bottle of wine close to the old man's nose, then pulled out the night pot from the side and poured the wine from the bottle into it.
0:19:17|0:19:25|He then smiled and picked up the other end of the opium pipe, gently placing it into the old man's mouth. The old man took a few puffs and soon stopped breathing.
0:19:31|0:19:35|The old man's premature peeking while drinking caused anger among all the people in Longevity Town.
0:19:35|0:19:50|[Niu Jieshi], as the instigator of this incident, was chased and cursed by the entire town. He could be seen running frantically through the alleys, hands clutching his head, with angry residents wielding cages closely behind him. The long sticks were about to strike him from behind.
0:19:50|0:19:54|[Niu Jieshi] picked up a stick, turned around and shouted, and [Painter] emerged from the other end.
0:19:59|0:20:4|[The Painter] was frightened, but the young man behind him was not afraid at all, and he chased after him with determination.
0:20:4|0:20:11|[Niu Jieshi] was scared and ran up the stairs again. He opened the door, turned around, picked up a wooden stick and swung it wildly a few times, then jumped out.
0:20:11|0:20:23|Seeing [Niu Jieshi] about to escape, the young men pushed the door open and chased after him. However, they immediately fell down below the high wall, as it turned out there was nothing behind the door. The people behind them, unaware of the situation, continued to push forward.
0:20:23|0:20:26|And [Niu Jieshi] took advantage of the chaos, grabbing the rope by the wall and climbing to the highest point.
0:20:52|0:20:53|Hearing what the [Mayor] said.
0:20:53|0:21:0|Everyone lowered their heads, no longer displaying their previous arrogance. Then, the camera passed through a narrow underground passage.
0:21:0|0:21:2|Arrived at a door.
0:21:24|0:21:40|At this moment, [Blacksmith] was lost in memories. In the pouring rain, [Niu Jieshi] stood bare-chested, wearing only a pair of shorts to cover himself. He was seen playfully splashing water from a ladle onto the girls around him under the umbrella, causing them to scream in surprise.
0:21:40|0:21:44|The blacksmith recalled this scene with such hatred that he broke the wooden stick in his hand.
0:21:44|0:21:50|In his memory, he walked up behind [Niu Jieshi] in unbearable anger, and then forcefully pushed [Niu Jieshi]'s head into the water tank.
0:21:53|0:21:58|Immediately, he lifted [Niu Jieshi] with one hand and threw him onto the stone slab, delivering a fierce blow to his abdomen.
0:21:58|0:22:6|[Niu Jieshi] hadn't reacted yet, only to see the blacksmith as strong as an ox, pulling his hair and repeatedly hitting the wall.
0:22:23|0:22:28|The butcher [Niu Boss] cut the meat with a knife, lost in memories of [Niu Jieshi].
0:23:4|0:23:9|[Niu Jieshi] raised the axe and looked at the plaque of the Niu ancestors, which made [Widow Ma] extremely frightened.
0:23:53|0:24:13|The [Painter] looked into the distance with a pensive expression, slowly raising his hand.
0:24:13|0:24:17|The wife placed her legs on the shoulders of [Painter], but he suddenly stopped.
0:24:33|0:24:34|At this moment, [Niu Jieshi] lifts up the floorboards.
0:24:45|0:24:50|The painter jabbed the floor with an iron rod, while his wife shouted angrily holding an axe.
0:25:4|0:25:10|The painter quickly ran up the wooden ladder, trying to intercept Niu Jieshi.
0:25:10|0:25:18|[Niu Jieshi] ran forward quickly as if his feet were oiled, and [Painter] leaped down from the high wall and quickly caught up with him.
0:25:18|0:25:26|But at this moment, a big knife suddenly appeared above his head. He looked up in fear and saw [Niu Jieshi] jumping directly in front of him, approaching step by step.
0:25:45|0:25:52|After speaking, [Niu Jieshi] put away the big knife at the feet of the [Painter]. The [Painter], who had lifted his leg, was so scared that he took a sharp breath, and his body couldn't help but sway.
0:25:52|0:25:59|[Niu Jieshi] turned around, revealing a fierce gaze. [Painter] quickly restrained himself from moving. Then, [Niu Jieshi] walked away with a knife.
0:26:30|0:26:38|At this moment, a group of residents wearing cloaks were squatting by the waterway, wetting their cloths to wipe their faces. [Niu Jieshi] had a piece of grass in his mouth, getting ready to go down the mountain.
0:26:38|0:26:43|He saw from a distance that a ceremony was being held in the town, with a group of residents wearing cloaks.
0:26:46|0:26:54|Several strong men, bare-chested, swinging their arms and slapping their thighs, the old man who shifted the blame lay on the wooden boat, with the mute [Widow Ma] sitting beside him.
0:26:54|0:27:2|[Mayor] walked solemnly at the front of the wooden boat, while [Widow Ma] sat on the boat, looking calmly ahead with a hint of despair in her eyes.
0:27:2|0:27:12|The people behind the wooden boat lined up in a queue, raising and lowering their hands in a repetitive motion. They slowly moved forward, each person with a sad expression on their face.
0:27:14|0:27:23|[Niu Jieshi] was full of curiosity, sitting on the hilltop, observing their every move. But just as he was about to reach his limit, everyone suddenly stopped in their tracks, pounding their chests and shouting towards the sky.
0:27:50|0:28:5|Widow Ma put on the cloak and hat, a few shirtless men pushed the wooden boat to the center of the lake. The people on the shore silently watched the body and Widow Ma's disappearing figure. The Mayor on the shore shouted again.
0:28:8|0:28:14|After hearing the command, everyone put their hands together in front of their chests, bowed, and knelt down.
0:28:14|0:28:20|At this moment, the figure of [Widow Ma] on the distant wooden boat gradually drifted away and slowly sank into the lake.
0:28:24|0:28:31|[Widow Ma] silently looked at the deep, bottomless lake, then slowly closed her eyes, waiting for the arrival of death.
0:28:31|0:28:33|The people on the shore still bowed their heads in prayer.
0:28:40|0:28:51|The painter's wife widened her eyes when she saw it, grabbed the mayor who was kneeling in front of her, only to see Niu Jieshi emerging from the water, shaking his wet hair, with Widow Ma still in his hands.
0:28:51|0:29:2|[Mayor] saw this scene and widened his eyes in surprise. [Niu Jieshi] struggled to swim and dragged [Widow Ma] to the shore. Then, he panted heavily as he carried [Widow Ma] and walked in front of [Mayor].
0:29:14|0:29:20|[Mayor] lowered his head as he watched [Niu Jieshi] walk away, and the others didn't know what to say.
0:29:20|0:29:25|Early the next morning, the cloak and bellyband of [Widow Ma] were fluttering in the wind above the ancestral hall.
0:29:25|0:29:33|In a state of unconsciousness, [Widow Ma] lay on a blanket, exposing her smooth back. Suddenly, she furrowed her brow, slightly opened her eyes, and then rolled over.
0:29:33|0:29:37|At this moment, she realized that she was in a strange environment.
0:29:38|0:29:48|Suddenly, a suspicious sound reached his ears, and he immediately sat up. He then wrapped the thin blanket around himself and listened carefully to the movements outside.
0:29:48|0:29:57|He then picked up a small axe next to the bed and walked out slowly. There, a man with bare arms was hiding behind the water tank, constantly making painful gasping sounds.
0:29:58|0:30:12|[Widow Ma] slowly approached, but the man stood up with both hands covered in blood. He was so scared that he raised the axe. At that moment, the man turned around, and when he saw [Niu Jieshi] with half of his face covered in blood, he was so scared that he threw the axe away and then fainted on the ground.
0:30:12|0:30:16|[Niu Jieshi] held a knife in one hand and a bowl in the other, smiling as he glanced at the fainting [Widow Ma].
0:30:17|0:30:22|He then dropped the knife in his hand and wiped the remaining blood on the winding path.
0:30:22|0:30:28|At this moment, the residents stood in place, watching Widow Ma's clothes fluttering above the ancestral hall.
0:30:28|0:30:31|People gathered in small groups, whispering about Widow Ma.
0:30:31|0:30:41|After a while, the frightened [Widow Ma] regained consciousness. She turned her head and saw [Niu Jieshi] sleeping beside her, with dried bloodstains still visible at the corner of her mouth.
0:30:41|0:30:49|[Niu Jieshi] lay in bed fast asleep, while [Widow Ma] wrapped in a thin cloth slowly opened the door and walked out. She walked down the stairs barefoot, unaware.
0:30:49|0:30:51|Several pairs of eyes had been watching her for a while.
0:30:51|0:31:1|As they entered the alley, [Widow Ma] was followed by several women who gathered together, whispering. [Widow Ma] glanced back and then continued walking forward.
0:31:1|0:31:10|Arriving at the corner, the painter's wife, with hands on her hips, stood in the middle of the alley, Widow Ma lowered her head and walked to the left, and the other person followed suit.
0:31:10|0:31:13|She then moved to the other side, and the other person followed suit.
0:31:16|0:31:23|At this moment, the [Painter]'s wife suddenly walked up to him, sniffing at his lips and neck incessantly.
0:31:23|0:31:32|[Widow Ma] inexplicably leaned her body backwards, only to see the other person staring at her fiercely, then glanced down below, followed by a punch to her abdomen.
0:31:32|0:31:38|The painter's wife grabbed Widow Ma's chin, but got blood on the corner of her mouth. She rubbed her fingers.
0:32:1|0:32:11|Upon hearing the instructions from the [Painter]'s wife, everyone immediately stopped arguing. [Widow Ma] knelt on the ground, sobbing softly, and then the [Painter]'s wife took out a packet of medicine.
0:32:11|0:32:20|Widow Ma glanced at the package, then looked up at the painter's wife. At that moment, her face revealed the marks of a struggle, and her eyes were filled with resentment.
0:32:20|0:32:27|Widow Ma slowly approached the painter's wife, staring straight at her, then stood still and tore off the cloth on her body.
0:32:28|0:32:36|The women beside her lowered their heads unwilling to look at him, especially when the daughter-in-law approached with gritted teeth, but [Widow Ma] held her head high without any fear.
0:32:36|0:32:42|After they left, [Widow Ma] finally put away her strong facade, a hint of sadness showing in her eyes.
0:32:55|0:33:11|At night, [Niu Jieshi] walked alone on the street, carrying a few sausages in his hand. He saw an old man playing the drum on the roadside. He walked up with a smile, placed the sausages on the drum, and then followed the rhythm, hanging the sausages around his neck. He danced with his arms swinging up and down to the beat.
0:33:11|0:33:13|He then walked through the underground passage.
0:33:13|0:33:19|Looking at the fresh sausage in his hand, Niu Jieshi couldn't help but smile happily, completely unaware that there were several people with straw hats behind him.
0:33:19|0:33:22|At the door, he stuck out his butt and looked through the crack.
0:33:24|0:33:30|At this moment, someone made a cross on his buttocks and inserted a long needle tube diligently.
0:33:34|0:33:43|The group of people wearing straw hats continued to chase after [Niu Jieshi], who was frightened and ran in all directions. No matter which alley he turned into, the people with straw hats would always appear.
0:33:43|0:33:52|[Niu Jieshi] kept cursing non-stop, but his legs never stopped moving. The needles stuck in his buttocks were flung to the ground by him, and then his movements gradually slowed down.
0:33:53|0:34:6|Following that, Niu Jieshi knelt on the ground, his eyes starting to lose focus, then suddenly passed out. The crowd took off their hats and stood around. It turned out that the demon god was carrying out a plan.
0:34:6|0:34:12|At this moment, the man in a military cap walked over with a syringe, the fool nodded with a silly smile, and [Widow Ma] spoke.
0:34:14|0:34:48|Several women worked together to turn [Niu Jieshi] over. They pulled down [Niu Jieshi]'s pants and upon seeing it, they all closed their eyes. [Widow Ma] widened her eyes, took a closer look, and then grabbed a knife heading towards the man. Unexpectedly, [Niu Jieshi] struggled and sat up. The women pushed [Niu Jieshi] towards the needle in the fool's hand.
0:34:53|0:34:56|The woman with torn trousers screamed and left, followed by the idiot.
0:34:56|0:35:6|On the other side, [Niu Jieshi] lay on the ground, constantly reaching out to tug at the woman's skirt, frightening her away.
0:35:6|0:35:10|[Widow Ma] grabbed [Niu Jieshi] by the collar, but [Niu Jieshi] turned around and lifted him up directly.
0:35:38|0:35:52|The scene returns to reality, a withered tree on the cliff swaying in the cold wind. At this moment, [Niu Jieshi] lies peacefully in the cave. Suddenly, the entire mountain starts shaking uncontrollably, with [Widow Ma] sitting on the side expressionless, frowning.
0:35:52|0:36:3|Next, lying directly beside [Niu Jieshi], he stared blankly at the swaying cliff, then turned to look at the pale [Niu Jieshi] beside him, once again falling into the memories the young man had mentioned.
0:36:45|0:37:1|The scene returns to the beginning of the movie, with Niu Jieshi being carried in a sack due to the polluted water. They hang Niu Jieshi in the carriage, beating him with sticks. The out-of-control Doctor passes by the carriage, hitting the sack that was thrown down, preventing it from falling off the cliff.
0:37:6|0:37:11|From this point on, [Niu Jieshi] began his revenge plan.
0:37:11|0:37:16|The dynamite barrel was pulled out by [Niu Jieshi] and thrown at the feet of the blacksmith hiding behind the rocks.
0:37:16|0:37:20|[Mayor] is in the toilet when the wooden board is torn apart by a rope.
0:37:23|0:37:29|Half Immortal, whose glasses were stolen, squinted as he opened the door, only to find a huge beehive above his head.
0:37:29|0:37:34|With a loud explosion, the blacksmith and [Painter] were coughing in the dust.
0:37:34|0:37:39|The blacksmith in his sleep heard the sound of sharpening knives and immediately opened his eyes and sat up.
0:37:39|0:37:47|[Niu Jieshi] walked along the wall with an iron saw, while the blacksmith listened to the sound all the way, crawling from the foot of the bed to the head of the bed, only to hear the sound coming from all directions outside the house.
0:37:48|0:37:52|The blacksmith held up a spear against the roof, but still got a hole smashed through by [Niu Jieshi].
0:37:52|0:37:56|To control Niu Jieshi's erratic behavior, Doctor Niu actually injected medication into the cured meat.
0:38:12|0:38:18|Everyone in the town couldn't bear [Niu Jieshi]'s harassment and tried various ways to teach him a lesson.
0:38:18|0:38:24|[Niu Jieshi], however, stood side by side with a group of children and urinated on the wall.
0:38:36|0:38:40|Yu Qi slowly put his wife on the bed and pressed down anxiously.
0:38:40|0:38:58|As the two were getting into it, the demon suddenly saw a bright light in front of him. The wooden boards on the roof had been lifted, and [Doctor Niu] turned to look. The demon let out a howl.
0:38:58|0:39:2|After speaking, the fool put down the plank and [Niu Jieshi] left with a smile.
0:39:25|0:39:28|Banshen looked at [Doctor Niu] holding a syringe, and was so scared that he immediately went upstairs.
0:39:28|0:39:33|Doctor Niu tapped the empty syringe twice, then looked to the side with a wicked smile on his face.
0:39:33|0:39:41|Before long, Banxian, who heard the commotion, ran downstairs and saw a donkey lying on the needle of [Widow Ma].
0:39:41|0:39:43|Banshen saw this scene and collapsed on the ground.
0:39:50|0:39:56|Next, Doctor Niu slowly sprinkled the aphrodisiac powder into the water at the upstream entrance.
0:39:56|0:40:4|Under the continuous flow of water, the aphrodisiac powder had already merged with it, and then the water flowed through different pipes to every corner of Changshou Town.
0:40:4|0:40:16|In the village, the rushing river at this moment is also like a gust of wind, continuously transporting towards the distance, causing layers of embossed patterns to be built inside the uneven pipes, and the crisscrossing waterways are scattered throughout the entire town.
0:40:16|0:40:21|Before long, the water gradually became calm, gently flowing through the smooth pipes.
0:40:21|0:40:22|Flowing slowly forward.
0:40:22|0:40:30|At this moment, the residents downstream are either rinsing rice with water or washing vegetables. The women are chatting as usual.
0:40:31|0:40:49|Yao Shen took a sip of tea, when suddenly, [Painter] blew at his feet, causing his body to react inexplicably. The semi-immortal lay on the chair, leisurely drinking from the gourd in his hand. [Painter] boldly picked up a bottle of wine and poured it into his mouth. Each person in the village drank water containing aphrodisiac powder at different times.
0:40:58|0:41:6|The farce came to a halt, with clothes scattered all over the streets of Changshou Town. Inside the house, [Mayor]'s people gathered, their faces showing signs of distress.
0:41:19|0:41:37|At this moment, [Niu Jieshi] climbed onto the roof, came down the wooden ladder, opened a door and walked in. The blacksmith stood not far away, watching the disappearing figure of [Niu Jieshi]. Inside the house, [Widow Ma] lay on the bed tossing and turning, unable to resist the strong reactions in her body. She grabbed the sheet with one hand, closed her eyes, mouth slightly open, breathing heavily.
0:41:37|0:41:44|At this moment, a hand appeared at [Widow Ma]'s waist. In confusion, she grabbed hold of this warm hand, but instantly became clear-headed again.
0:41:46|0:41:52|[Widow Ma] struggled to sit up, exerting all her strength to break free from the embrace, only to see that the person who had burst into the room was [Niu Jieshi].
0:41:52|0:41:59|[Niu Jieshi] laughed and looked at the dumbfounded [Widow Ma], then immediately got up and pushed her down onto the bed.
0:41:59|0:42:7|After speaking, she leaned in and kissed [Widow Ma] on the face, but the latter immediately dodged. [Widow Ma] pushed her away and scrambled to escape in a panic.
0:42:7|0:42:10|[Niu Jieshi] grabbed her waist and [Widow Ma] pushed him away in fright.
0:42:40|0:42:46|Seeing [Niu Jieshi]'s unruly expression, [Widow Ma] raised her hand and gently slapped him.
0:42:46|0:42:52|After speaking, [Niu Jieshi] once again pinned [Widow Ma] down, and at this moment, Widow Ma's eyes had become unfocused.
0:42:52|0:42:57|Before long, the two in the sand tent were immersed in the joy of spring night.
0:42:57|0:43:3|The blacksmith, Niu Jieshi, who witnessed everything, sat dejectedly on the ground. He slapped his forehead in frustration and started crying helplessly.
0:43:8|0:43:22|Lying on the lap of [Niu Jieshi], [Widow Ma] immediately sat up when she heard a sound, only to find that it was coming from inside the quilt. She lay back down and stuck her head in, only to see [Niu Jieshi] holding a music box and extending his arm outside, with [Widow Ma] following suit and crawling out.
0:43:23|0:43:29|He reached out to grab the music box from [Niu Jieshi]'s hand, but she just smiled and switched it to the other hand.
0:43:29|0:43:34|Widow Ma disregarded everything and pressed on Niu Jieshi's chest, taking this strange gadget.
0:43:34|0:43:40|He tightly held the music box, constantly winding it up, his eyes fixed on [Niu Jieshi] lying beside him.
0:43:40|0:43:43|At this moment, [Niu Jieshi] squinted his eyes, stretched out his arms, and grinned with his mouth open.
0:43:48|0:44:4|Early the next morning, there was a commotion in the sky above Changshou Town. A man was seen chasing out of his house with a stick, while a woman in front of him ran away in fear. Not far away, another woman was holding a corn cob and throwing it at the shirtless man. Some young men and women couldn't help but get intimate during the day.
0:44:4|0:44:11|Middle-aged men were wrestling, while the women were pulling and scolding. Upon seeing all this, the [Mayor] couldn't help but sigh.
0:44:22|0:44:26|[Mayor] opened his cloak, looked into the distance, and then spoke.
0:44:28|0:44:45|As soon as the words fell, a young man with glasses sat in the passenger seat of the truck, using his gloved hand to wipe the dusty rearview mirror. Several people wearing cloaks sat silently in the back of the truck, as dust flew up from the yellow earth. The truck headed towards Changshou Town, and then the scene shifted.
0:44:45|0:44:48|The camera lingers on a house in Changshou Town.
0:44:56|0:45:3|[Doctor Niu] wrote the four characters of "New Youjinsheng" and hung them on the wooden plaque, then turned around, a hint of cunning in his eyes.
0:45:42|0:45:55|The scene shifts, with the young man bringing [Doctor] to the place where they used to hold meetings.
0:45:55|0:45:59|The boy smiled at [Doctor] and then quickly ran out.
0:45:59|0:46:7|[Doctor] approached to observe the furnishings in the room, then turned to look at the cushions and stools across from him, recalling once again what the young man had said.
0:46:9|0:46:15|At this moment, the people in the room are engaged in a heated discussion, especially [Widow Ma] who is gesturing wildly.
0:46:15|0:46:19|The butcher [Niu Jieshi] on the side kept pointing and arguing back.
0:46:19|0:46:22|Doctor Niu glanced at the pocket watch in his hand and then at the people who were still discussing.
0:46:41|0:46:54|At this moment, [Niu Jieshi] joyfully rides his bicycle through the alleys of Changshou Town. He looks up excitedly at the rapidly retreating sky, but as he reaches the downhill road, the bicycle suddenly becomes uncontrollable.
0:46:54|0:47:1|In the alley, people were scared and dodging, [Niu Jieshi] hurriedly pressed the brakes, but the bicycle still didn't stop, and he couldn't help but scream in fear.
0:47:3|0:47:13|[Niu Jieshi] crashed through the door and fell in a room, then stumbled out from the side door, only to collapse on the ground after a few steps, grimacing in pain.
0:47:35|0:47:40|The butcher Niu Jieshi boss happily smiled and chopped the pork on the cutting board with a knife.
0:47:40|0:47:44|[Niu Jieshi] continued to walk forward, and a girl saw him and quickly hid to the side.
0:47:44|0:47:45|He grabbed the girl and asked.
0:47:50|0:47:54|The girl turned her head to look at [Niu Jieshi], one of her eyes red and terrifying.
0:47:54|0:48:0|Then, he dropped the basket and slapped his grabbed arm before running back home in a panic.
0:48:0|0:48:6|[Niu Jieshi] walked past the chicken stall with a basket in hand. The owner's hand shook, causing the knife to fall into the iron basin.
0:48:6|0:48:8|He turned his head, and the boss explained in a fluster.
0:48:34|0:48:38|He squatted down and turned to look at the mother and daughter, but the [Midwife] pulled out a strand of his hair.
0:48:57|0:49:3|The midwife did not answer, but directly put the tuft of hair into the stove, and the flames suddenly became vigorous.
0:49:3|0:49:10|At this moment, the scene shifts to [Doctor], who is seen cutting a piece of paper from the ashes, then carefully examining it in front of his eyes for a long time.
0:49:10|0:49:19|He widened his eyes, leaned in to take a closer look, then took out the charred wooden frame and placed the remaining pieces of paper on it, gesturing.
0:49:19|0:49:29|Next, [Doctor] sat in front of a bronze mirror, seen him using his fingers to open his eyes, looking at himself in the reflection of the mirror, then opened his mouth, touched his chin and neck.
0:49:34|0:49:38|The fool burst into laughter at the words of [Doctor], who grinned with his mouth open and eyes squinted.
0:49:38|0:49:41|The scene then cuts back to a flashback about [Niu Jieshi].
0:49:48|0:49:55|[Niu Jieshi] gritted her teeth, gripping the girl's chin tightly. The old man tugged at her hand, and as she let go, the two of them quickly left.
0:50:9|0:50:12|Widow Ma's ridicule made [Niu Jieshi] start to doubt again.
0:50:12|0:50:17|He walked to the water's edge, bent down to look at his face in the reflection, but a streak of blood appeared in the water.
0:50:17|0:50:20|He stood up in surprise and found someone standing behind him.
0:50:20|0:50:28|The man glanced at [Niu Jieshi], said nothing, and then ran off with the meat on his shoulder.
0:50:28|0:50:34|After cursing, he immediately took a shortcut to intercept the man.
0:50:34|0:50:36|The other party was so scared that they threw the meat onto Niu Jieshi's back.
0:50:45|0:50:55|At this moment, two people arrived and carried the meat downstairs.
0:50:55|0:51:0|Niu Jieshi, who is confused and muddle-headed, turned to look at the man who had just carried the meat.
0:51:13|0:51:21|[Niu Jieshi] arrived at the competition scene, refusing to give up.
0:51:21|0:51:26|The child across the street gestured with his finger, and [Niu Jieshi] sat down in front of him tirelessly. The two began to compete in arm wrestling.
0:51:36|0:51:41|After the match, [Niu Jieshi] looked dejected, a girl walked silently past him and he glanced at her.
0:52:3|0:52:9|He turned back and pulled the head rope off Widow Ma.
0:52:9|0:52:15|[Niu Jieshi] walked along the road with a head rope in his hand, tying it around his wrist as he walked forward. However, he was stopped by [Doctor Niu].
0:52:36|0:52:40|He played with the head rope while looking at the meat on the cutting board, carefully selecting from left to right.
0:52:43|0:52:52|[Niu Jieshi] inserted the head rope into the opening of the meat strip, picked up two pieces of meat, compared their sizes, and [Doctor Niu] stared closely at the two pieces of meat.
0:53:2|0:53:5|He smiled and threw back a piece of meat before turning and leaving.
0:53:5|0:53:10|[Doctor Niu] picked up the meat, examined it carefully, and then hung it on the wooden board behind.
0:53:10|0:53:16|Not long after, the piece of meat hung up by [Doctor Niu] started oozing out a puddle of medicine.
0:53:16|0:53:19|The large stone supported by a wooden stick stands tall on the mountain top.
0:53:19|0:53:22|At this moment, [Niu Jieshi] sat on Widow Ma's bed, recalling recent events.
0:53:37|0:53:43|Then, he took off his shirt, revealing his arms, still looking puzzled. [Widow Ma] reached out and hooked her hand around his neck.
0:53:43|0:53:51|[Niu Jieshi] lay down on [Widow Ma] and before long, he lost interest and called it quits.
0:53:51|0:53:56|Widow Ma, who didn't have enough fun, pouted and kissed him, but he frowned tightly, with no response.
0:53:58|0:54:4|After speaking, he turned over and lay down beside [Widow Ma], letting out a deep sigh.
0:54:4|0:54:17|Seeing Niu Jieshi in distress, Widow Ma thought for a moment, then turned around. She raised her hand to touch Niu Jieshi's face, then kissed his head. However, Niu Jieshi stared blankly at the ceiling, his mind consumed by doubts.
0:54:17|0:54:19|At this moment, a photo of an elderly couple appears on the screen.
0:54:20|0:54:24|Next to the stone wall hangs photos of [Doctor Niu] from childhood to adulthood.
0:54:24|0:54:29|The doctor looked up at the wall, and then the scene froze on a recent photo of Doctor Niu.
0:54:29|0:54:36|During the observation, he discovered [Doctor Niu]'s graduation photo and alma mater, only to find out that [Doctor Niu] and himself graduated from the same school.
0:54:36|0:54:40|Later, he noticed the few lines of text on the old couple's photo, which read,
0:54:48|0:55:8|The scene shifts, only to see young [Niu Jieshi] leaning on the wall. He opens a small window and extends a long stick inside. As he approaches the cured meat on the wall, he moves the pliers on the end of the stick to cut the line. Just as he is about to succeed, he is discovered by Doctor Niu's grandfather. After a long standoff, [Niu Jieshi] still manages to snatch it away.
0:55:8|0:55:16|Niu Wa, also known as [Doctor Niu] when he was young, was seen stuffing the entire window with wood, then nervously tapping it with a hammer.
0:55:47|0:55:51|The boy held a photo frame in his hands and then stood up to hand it to [Doctor].
0:55:51|0:55:55|He took out a frame and looked at it, inside was an X-ray photo.
0:55:55|0:55:58|He then picked up the file bag underneath.
0:56:1|0:56:6|The name "Niu Jieshi" was written on the file bag, and the person examining the patient was [Doctor Niu].
0:56:6|0:56:11|[Doctor] flipped through the records in the file bag, recalling the morning when he arrived in Changshou Town.
0:56:14|0:56:23|In the morning, after he came out from the dean's office holding something, a group of people in cloaks were carrying something inside. He was so attracted that he accidentally bumped into someone.
0:56:23|0:56:28|At this moment, he finally realized that the person he collided with was [Doctor Niu].
0:56:28|0:56:38|Shortly after, he smiled and put the cloak's hat on his head. Then, the figure of [Doctor] appeared in the alley. The person in the cloak passed by him, and he immediately turned around and quietly followed behind.
0:56:38|0:56:53|The person in front reached out and shook the bell, the [Doctor] in a cloak followed suit. When they arrived, the [Doctor] quietly stopped, then pushed open the door next to them, carrying a box and walking in. Inside the innermost room came a noisy bell sound, and the [Doctor] walked over with the bag on their back.
0:56:54|0:57:0|Upon seeing someone inside, he stood at the doorway and looked around, only to see bells hanging on the threads of the loom.
0:57:0|0:57:5|[Doctor Niu] was sitting inside, working quickly and paying no attention to the [Doctor] standing in the doorway.
0:57:5|0:57:15|At this moment, the [Doctor] was whistling and humming the melody from the music box of [Niu Jieshi]. Upon hearing the sound, [Doctor Niu] slowly stopped the loom, with an unusually cold expression.
0:57:35|0:57:42|The Doctor walked over with a smile, grabbed the bell on the loom, and the smile on Doctor Niu's face suddenly disappeared.
0:58:31|0:58:55|After speaking, he picked up the bell in his hand, and a melody of bells rang out. A young man was seen squatting at the highest point of the 10th floor, waving his hand. Following that, everyone relied on the bell to pass on information. [Niu Jieshi] appeared at the alley entrance riding a bicycle, with a cloth bag hanging around his neck.
0:58:55|0:59:0|He continued to ride his bicycle forward, but was stopped by a nervous big man.
0:59:11|0:59:20|[Niu Jieshi] pushed away the big man, the women beside him chuckled, but the baby in his arms was wailing loudly.
0:59:20|0:59:27|After cursing, [Niu Jieshi] rode away on his bicycle. The big man then turned his head, revealing a meaningful smile.
0:59:27|0:59:31|At night, [Niu Jieshi] walked alone through the dark underground passage, wearing a cloak.
0:59:31|0:59:33|From a distance, a lively noise could be heard.
0:59:33|0:59:40|He quickly walked up the stairs, crossed the narrow wooden bridge to the wedding banquet, and [Niu Jieshi] alone did not recognize him, so she called out to him.
0:59:48|1:0:5|In this scene, [Niu Jieshi] emerges from the ancestral grave of the Niu family, looking disheveled and holding a silver bracelet in his hand.
1:0:10|1:0:15|Chased to fight, but was stopped by everyone, while [Niu Jieshi] slipped away and ran to the roof.
1:0:51|1:0:54|After speaking, Niu Jieshi raised his glass and drank it all in one gulp.
1:0:54|1:0:58|[Niu Jieshi] looked around and then picked up the bowl to drink heartily.
1:0:58|1:1:0|At this moment, everyone was observing his reaction.
1:1:19|1:1:37|[Niu Jieshi] immersed in a peaceful atmosphere, happily lifted the wine bowl. The residents beside him shook the bell with their hands behind their backs. The girl next to him immediately stood up to toast. After drinking a few bowls, [Niu Jieshi] showed a drunken look, with wine uncontrollably flowing out of his mouth. In disbelief, she looked to the side and saw everyone drinking merrily.
1:1:37|1:1:55|She turned her head to the other side and saw the septuagenarian man pouring wine into his mouth. The woman drank a big bowl, which drew cheers from the others. Refusing to be outdone, [Niu Jieshi] gritted his teeth and started drinking as well. The young man helping to pour the wine looked at [Niu Jieshi].
1:1:55|1:2:12|The people drinking next to him were also quietly watching [Niu Jieshi]'s reaction. By now, [Niu Jieshi] had already drunk until his face was flushed and his eyes were swollen. He watched the bottle of wine moving back and forth on each table, but everyone else was still in high spirits, no one else was as uncomfortable as him. At this moment, the demon suddenly shouted.
1:2:45|1:3:2|After speaking, he lifted the wine bowl again. He struggled to turn his head, opened his mouth to find the salt in the bowl, and continued to drink. However, the wine in his mouth uncontrollably flowed out. His eyes blurred, he furrowed his brow and looked around. After a short while, he collapsed on the ground. The people beside him dared not speak as they watched Niu Jieshi fall to the ground.
1:3:2|1:3:4|Yi Qijiang led [Demon God] forward.
1:3:28|1:3:30|[Widow Ma] witnessed all of this from a distance.
1:3:30|1:3:35|The next morning, [Niu Jieshi] picked up a bronze mirror and carefully examined his face.
1:3:35|1:3:38|He opened his eyelids and looked, then touched his own neck.
1:3:38|1:3:44|At this moment, the sound of a child crying outside reached his ears, anger surged in his heart, and he rushed out.
1:3:44|1:3:49|When [Niu Jieshi] appeared, the children fell silent instantly.
1:4:6|1:4:10|The children were so scared that they cried, but they still obediently urinated with him.
1:4:10|1:4:14|[Niu Jieshi] is straining hard, his face twisted in a knot, but still unable to urinate.
1:4:14|1:4:18|The wolfhound on the side growled, turning its head to glare at him menacingly.
1:4:18|1:4:21|At this moment, the young man climbed up the wall.
1:4:33|1:4:37|One hand grabbed the boy's foot, pulled him down, and then he was locked in the room.
1:4:45|1:4:53|Doctor Niu instructed Niu Jieshi to leave.
1:4:53|1:4:57|[Niu Jieshi] smiled and took out the largest piece of meat in the shop, placing it on the cutting board.
1:4:57|1:5:2|[Doctor Niu] looked up at the meat hanging on the wall and chose a lean piece.
1:5:2|1:5:8|[Niu Jieshi] turned around with a smile, hesitating for a long time as he looked at the piece of meat on the wall that was supposed to be given to [Niu Jieshi] before.
1:5:10|1:5:14|[Doctor Niu] stared at [Niu Jieshi] and pointed again to the piece of meat on the wall.
1:5:14|1:5:30|In the afternoon, [Niu Jieshi] rode a bicycle alone on the roof, circling around.
1:5:30|1:5:33|[Widow Ma] heard the neighbors talking while hanging out the laundry.
1:5:42|1:5:50|[Widow Ma] turned around and hung up her clothes again, only to be startled by the person behind her. She saw the blacksmith staring straight at her belly.
1:5:50|1:5:55|[Widow Ma] immediately turned around and left, but when she was about to go downstairs, she ran into the demon who was going upstairs.
1:5:55|1:5:59|The demon walked proudly in front of Widow Ma, then stopped to look at her belly.
1:5:59|1:6:3|She then looked helplessly at [Widow Ma] and turned away, holding up her skirt.
1:6:3|1:6:8|Widow Ma stood in place and let out a sigh of relief without further trouble from the demon.
1:6:8|1:6:12|At night, [Niu Jieshi] arrived at Widow Ma's house, uncovered the steamer and took out the steamed buns.
1:6:16|1:6:20|Doctor Niu was eating a steamed bun when he caught Widow Ma's evasive gaze.
1:6:20|1:6:23|At this moment, he slowly reached out and pulled back a piece of white cloth.
1:6:23|1:6:25|[Niu Jieshi] felt something was wrong and walked over.
1:6:25|1:6:26|Widow Ma turns her back.
1:6:39|1:6:45|[Widow Ma] hurriedly used clothes to cover her already swollen belly, but she was still seen by [Niu Jieshi].
1:6:45|1:6:54|[Widow Ma] sighed and pushed [Niu Jieshi] sitting on the bed in front of her. Curious, [Niu Jieshi] walked over and stared at [Widow Ma]'s belly, then squatted down in front of her.
1:6:54|1:7:0|Later, [Widow Ma] slowly lifted the corners of her clothes, revealing her swollen belly in front of [Niu Jieshi].
1:7:0|1:7:7|[Niu Jieshi] widened his eyes and looked at the scene in front of him. He reached out and gently touched his belly, only to see Widow Ma's belly trembling slightly.
1:7:7|1:7:12|Immediately, [Widow Ma] firmly held [Niu Jieshi]'s hand, and the excited [Niu Jieshi] looked up at [Widow Ma].
1:7:13|1:7:22|[Widow Ma] glanced at [Doctor Niu], then [Doctor Niu] lowered his head to look at her belly, tilted his head, and gently pressed his ear against [Widow Ma]'s belly.
1:7:22|1:7:24|Seeing this scene, [Widow Ma] couldn't help but burst into laughter.
1:7:24|1:7:28|At this moment, [Doctor Niu] tightly held his stomach, excitement shining in his eyes.
1:7:28|1:7:36|However, at this moment, [Widow Ma] suddenly stopped smiling. She closed her eyes tightly, and all that flashed through her mind were the looks of the people in cloaks staring at her, including [Mayor].
1:7:37|1:7:43|Some people have desire in their eyes, some have anger, and others have fleeting compassion.
1:7:43|1:7:57|At this moment, Widow Ma lying on the bed pushed away Doctor Niu's hand touching her belly. Then she sat up, picked up the music box beside the bed. Doctor Niu looked at Widow Ma in confusion, only to see her pointing outside while standing by the bed. Doctor Niu asked in puzzlement.
1:7:57|1:8:1|Widow Ma hurriedly walked to the other side and pulled Doctor Niu, who was lying on the bed.
1:8:3|1:8:8|Widow Ma took out the music box given by Niu Jieshi and stuffed it into Niu Jieshi's hand.
1:8:8|1:8:15|Carrying a music box, [Niu Jieshi] was puzzled, while [Widow Ma] frowned and pushed [Niu Jieshi] out the door, finally slamming the door shut.
1:8:15|1:8:18|[Niu Jieshi] stood outside the door, with a mournful expression on his face.
1:8:18|1:8:25|After a while, she quickly ran to the Mayor's ancestral hall, squeezed in through a crack, and then locked the door from the inside with a twist of her hand.
1:8:25|1:8:30|She then took the key off and hung it around her neck, and then slammed the door shut heavily.
1:8:30|1:8:36|In the early hours of the next day, the sky was densely covered with dark clouds, and the heavy rain fell incessantly like beads off a broken string.
1:8:36|1:8:39|At this moment, [Niu Jieshi] is leaning against his body, sitting in front of the ancestral tablet.
1:8:54|1:9:9|[Niu Jieshi] looked out through the crack in the door and saw the young men of the town, led by the [Mayor], dancing shirtless in the rain. The [Mayor] stood nearby observing, while inside, [Niu Jieshi] couldn't resist the urge to join them. He took off his own shirt and then squeezed through the crack to join the dance.
1:9:22|1:9:29|[Niu Jieshi], with only a pair of large underpants left, ran into the crowd with his hands raised, shouting and pushing aside a few young men blocking the way.
1:9:29|1:9:34|Running along, he deliberately used his body to collide with others, as if venting the anger in his heart.
1:9:34|1:9:43|Seeing Niu Jieshi acting so crazy, the young man beside him was puzzled. But soon, the surrounding young men scattered and fled, leaving only Niu Jieshi dancing joyfully in the rain.
1:9:43|1:9:49|Seeing that there was no one around, [Niu Jieshi] shivered, and when he woke up again, there were already many people standing around him.
1:10:14|1:10:32|Soon, [Niu Jieshi] was quickly carried to the home of [Doctor Niu] by the crowd. A strange electric device slowly approached [Niu Jieshi]'s chest, emitting an eerie light. The sound of the machine's electric current entered [Niu Jieshi]'s ears, leaving him bewildered as he lay there. At that moment, [Doctor Niu] opened the door and walked in, then drew back the bed curtain.
1:10:38|1:10:54|Later, he left with a file bag, [Niu Jieshi] watched [Doctor Niu] closely with his brother and the boss, only to see [Doctor Niu] sitting on the other side quietly discussing with the demon and others, he raised the X-ray photo he had just taken and pointed to it.
1:10:54|1:11:3|The demon god frowned as he looked at the light film, while the anxious Niu Jieshi propped up his neck to look at them, then he couldn't help but cough, and the hand covering his mouth began to tremble.
1:11:4|1:11:8|Next, he lay on the frame and was carried out by someone.
1:11:8|1:11:12|[Niu Jieshi] looked at the pitch-black cave wall with a sense of powerlessness in his eyes.
1:11:12|1:11:17|Tears streamed down his cheeks the moment he stepped out of the corridor.
1:11:17|1:11:21|The clouds in the sky changed rapidly, and soon, [Niu Jieshi] was sent back to the ancestral hall.
1:11:21|1:11:26|Niu Jieshi is placed in the center, surrounded by white candles.
1:11:26|1:11:30|They then walked in a line according to the direction of the candles.
1:11:30|1:11:34|[Niu Jieshi] turned his head and found his other hand was tied with a rope by someone.
1:11:35|1:11:41|He slowly propped himself up on the crutch and sat up, only to see his father's will in front of him.
1:11:41|1:11:44|He looked at the photo and remembered the day of his father's funeral.
1:11:44|1:11:50|At that time, Father lay on the coffin board, his eyes not even closed, and the people around whispered softly.
1:12:3|1:12:12|The memory comes to an end here. At this moment, [Doctor Niu] turned around, holding a piece of film and placing it on the projector, with a rustling sound coming from inside.
1:12:40|1:12:58|The Doctor turned to look at Doctor Niu with a blank expression. At that moment, a flash of the Doctor performing surgery appeared, and standing in the distance was Doctor Niu holding a pocket watch. The Doctor raised his hands covered in blood, frowning as he looked at Niu Jieshi. The scene returned to reality, and at that moment, several burly men in cloaks entered from outside.
1:12:58|1:13:4|Soon, they surrounded [Doctor] in a circle, he pretended to be calm, staring at [Doctor Niu] sitting not far away.
1:13:9|1:13:15|After speaking, he looked around and signaled to the people nearby. The crowd then rushed forward and subdued [Doctor].
1:13:15|1:13:28|During the struggle, the cloak's hat was torn apart. But at that moment, the ground began to shake continuously. Everyone temporarily stopped and looked at the dust leaking from the ceiling in panic. However, [Doctor Niu] remained seated calmly in the chair.
1:13:39|1:13:43|Soon, Doctor left Changshou Town and came to live temporarily on the mountain.
1:13:43|1:13:49|At this moment, he was shirtless, washing himself under the small waterfall with a towel, and then drying his body.
1:13:49|1:13:58|At this moment, there were sounds coming from the side. He walked out with a towel and saw a group of people in cloaks lining up and walking towards the distance.
1:14:1|1:14:8|After a while, the figure of [Doctor] squatting on the mountainside appeared in the frame, while the group of people in cloaks were walking forward at the foot of the mountain.
1:14:11|1:14:19|Halfway there, [Doctor] was attracted by the sound of a horse neighing. He cautiously leaned out and found a mare giving birth at the foot of the mountain.
1:14:19|1:14:24|A little foal has just been born, wobbling on its legs but manages to stand up quickly.
1:14:24|1:14:32|At this moment, several young people are guarding around the house on the hill. The group of people in cloaks walk out from the door and line up to walk down the mountain.
1:14:32|1:14:35|[Doctor] quietly stood on the roof and took a quick glance, then immediately turned back.
1:14:36|1:14:55|At this moment, a pair of leather shoes appeared at the skylight. [Doctor] propped up his body and jumped directly from the skylight. Hearing the sound behind him, he turned around, bent down to observe the baby in the cradle. Then, [Doctor] reached out his finger and played with the baby's hand.
1:14:55|1:15:5|[Widow Ma] was standing behind him at some point, [Doctor] was startled, and [Widow Ma] stared at the stranger in front of her. [Doctor] pursed his lips and then explained to [Widow Ma].
1:15:14|1:15:21|Upon hearing the words of [Doctor], the look in [Widow Ma]'s eyes instantly turned desolate, replaced by a gaze filled with hatred.
1:15:21|1:15:25|At this moment, the scene cuts back to the large stone supported by several wooden sticks.
1:15:25|1:15:37|At this moment, in Changshou Town, [Niu Jieshi] is standing by the wall with a few brothers, holding sticks in their hands. The [Doctor] who is leaning against the wall quietly takes a step back, only to see a bicycle on the roof not far away.
1:15:43|1:15:49|The doctor rode his bicycle quickly past, and Niu Jieshi and the others wanted to intercept but were powerless.
1:15:59|1:16:7|After speaking, he fell down from a high stone step, and the person in a cloak beside him looked at him curiously, while the horsemen and the demon walked past.
1:16:23|1:16:34|Next, an X-ray film appeared on the screen, and a hand slowly put it down, revealing [Mayor] lying on the bed with an IV drip.
1:16:34|1:16:35|Hearing what [Doctor] said.
1:16:35|1:16:37|[Mayor] is lost in memories.
1:16:43|1:16:52|The scene cuts back to the arm wrestling scene, revealing a stone hanging under the child's elbow. Below the table, a fat man pulls the pendulum with the tied string forcefully.
1:17:2|1:17:9|Only Niu Jieshi passed out on the spot because he drank strong liquor.
1:17:37|1:17:44|The young people taking a bath in the hot spring are not the same group, but take turns to immerse themselves in the icy water.
1:17:44|1:17:50|In the corridor, a group of women holding towels and hot tea are receiving the shivering young men.
1:17:50|1:18:0|However, at this moment, the gate of the ancestral hall remained tightly closed. From a distance, the [Mayor] saw that [Niu Jieshi] had not yet emerged. Ignoring the attempts of the [Midwife] to stop him, he took off his own clothes and walked directly into the crowd.
1:18:0|1:18:5|[Niu Jieshi] saw the [Mayor] standing in the rain with his arms raised, then quickly took off his own coat and ran out.
1:18:23|1:18:28|After speaking, the [Mayor] kept staring at the ceiling beam, [Doctor] turned to look, and then walked a few steps towards the inner room.
1:18:28|1:18:30|The wine pot was hidden on the glass-behind ceiling beam.
1:18:46|1:18:49|[Doctor] held the wine pot in his hand and looked around.
1:18:49|1:18:53|[Mayor] took out the wine glass hidden behind the pillow, and then raised it shakily.
1:18:53|1:18:57|He smiled when he saw it, then poured a glass for [Mayor].
1:19:13|1:19:17|The scene shifts, at this moment [Mayor] grabs the wine jug pulled up by the old man.
1:19:39|1:19:43|Niu Jieshi remembered sneaking a drink when he was a child, only to be scolded by [the old man].
1:19:43|1:19:47|Seeing [Old Master] so happy drinking now, I couldn't help but start laughing too.
1:20:1|1:20:4|The Widow Ma, kept in a pen, constantly struggles to break free.
1:20:4|1:20:9|Niu Jieshi took away Balfour's horse, actually to release it, and also to let the mare grind the wine!
1:20:32|1:20:37|[Niu Jieshi] found the locked-up teenager and then took out the key to unlock the chains.
1:20:37|1:20:43|At this moment, Doctor raised his glass, smiled and clinked it with Mayor, then they both raised their glasses and drank it all in one go.
1:20:43|1:20:49|Widow Ma is shown holding an IV tube, while Niu Jieshi lies beside her with a cut on his head.
1:20:57|1:21:2|Later, the scene cuts to the day when [Niu Jieshi] is going to the wedding banquet, [Widow Ma] stands in the corner, grabbing him and asking him not to go.
1:21:21|1:21:25|Widow Ma had the blacksmith watch over Niu Jieshi the night she asked him to leave.
1:21:32|1:21:37|[Widow Ma] covered her mouth and turned away.
1:21:37|1:21:39|Widow Ma turned around, tears in her eyes.
1:21:39|1:21:45|She walked into the Niu Jieshi market, raised her hand to touch her face, but was pushed out again.
1:21:45|1:21:49|Niu Jieshi refused to go out to the market, so Widow Ma knelt down in front of her directly.
1:21:49|1:21:54|[Niu Jieshi] Street Market paused for a moment, then [Widow Ma] looked up at [Niu Jieshi] Street Market and slowly closed the door.
1:21:55|1:22:9|More and more things became unclear to him, [Niu Jieshi] couldn't find a way to vent his emotions in the market. He rode his bicycle, lifted his head, and circled around the roof of the ancestral hall again and again, the sky above his head spinning along with his eyes.
1:22:9|1:22:21|At this moment, the scene cuts to the Mayor lying on the bed, reaching out his hand to pull the Doctor Niu towards him.
1:22:21|1:22:23|[Doctor] turned to look at [Mayor] and grinned.
1:22:25|1:22:40|The Doctor said no more. He straightened up, turned his back to the door frame, looked around, leaned against the door, then turned his head and smiled at the Mayor lying on the bed, who turned silently and spoke.
1:22:50|1:22:54|[Mayor] pondered for a moment, slowly opened his eyes and looked out the window.
1:22:54|1:22:57|At this moment, the camera shows the face of Niu Jieshi Street.
1:22:57|1:23:2|He lay on the bed, smiling, recalling the day when aphrodisiac was sprinkled into the river from upstream.
1:23:2|1:23:6|At that time, bubbles of various sizes floated in the alleys of Changshou Town.
1:23:6|1:23:11|Everyone walked out of the house, with happy smiles on their faces.
1:23:11|1:23:17|Some people try to catch the dancing bubbles with their hands, while others embrace tightly regardless of others' gazes.
1:23:17|1:23:23|[Painter] and the demon are standing on the swing, tightly pressed together, constantly blowing bubbles with their mouths.
1:23:23|1:23:27|Everyone looked up, enjoying this unbridled beauty.
1:23:27|1:23:40|When everyone was immersed in this rare romance, as an outsider, [Niu Jieshi] stood in the aisle, looking puzzled at these unusual proofs, even the butcher Niu boss found his own love.
1:23:40|1:23:44|People no longer fear Niu Jieshi as they did in the past, even showing him gentle smiles.
1:23:44|1:23:54|[Niu Jieshi] opened his mouth, looking incredulous, with a frown on his face as he gazed at the bubbles around him, deeply suspicious of the different attitudes others had towards him.
1:23:54|1:24:3|The scene cuts back to reality, where [Niu Jieshi] is lying quietly in the coffin. The young man places the stethoscope on his heart, but hears no sound.
1:24:3|1:24:7|The doctor smiled as he picked up the stethoscope and placed it on the chest of the young man.
1:24:7|1:24:11|Hearing the heartbeat coming from inside, Niu Jieshi smiled happily.
1:24:11|1:24:19|The doctor then placed the music box that had always been by Niu Jieshi's side into the coffin, followed by picking up a stone slab to cover his entire body.
1:24:20|1:24:29|The scene cuts to [Doctor Niu]'s room, where he takes out the piece of meat given to him by the cattle boss, slices it thinly, and then grabs it to eat.
1:24:29|1:24:33|At this moment, the Doctor walked over and turned off the film projector playing the music.
1:24:52|1:25:1|The doctor smelled the meat slices, put down the bowl, turned his head and smiled at [Doctor Niu].
1:26:1|1:26:14|The doctor turned and smiled at [Doctor Niu]. At that moment, the scene shifted to a baby's smile. Widow Ma, standing in the doorway, took a step back in fright, watching the doctor crouched on the ground.
1:26:14|1:26:22|[Widow Ma] raised her finger and pointed outside, not daring to make a sound. At this moment, [Doctor Niu] appeared in the scene, holding a bag of medicine and angrily questioning everyone.
1:26:27|1:26:29|[Mayor] and Banxian sat on the side, not saying a word.
1:26:29|1:26:33|Doctor Niu walked down the stairs again with his medical bag, looking at the crowd standing below.
1:27:10|1:27:15|Doctor Niu angrily threw away the medicine bag, the young man quietly squeezed into the crowd, and then immediately ran away.
1:27:15|1:27:19|Doctor Niu went upstairs and pointed at the people outside wearing cloaks.
1:27:32|1:27:38|The painter crouching on the rooftop was startled by the crazed Doctor Niu, who then turned around and knelt in front of the Mayor.
1:27:48|1:27:58|At this moment, Widow Ma, hidden in the crowd, pulled down the hood of her cloak, raised her head, stared resentfully at Doctor Niu kneeling there, and then slowly walked to the other side.
1:27:58|1:28:4|The person standing on the side tried to stop her, but seeing the fierce look in [Widow Ma]'s eyes, they silently stepped aside.
1:28:4|1:28:9|Widow Ma then turned her head and looked around, her expression blank as she scrutinized everyone involved.
1:28:9|1:28:12|She then walked to the middle, holding her belly with both hands.
1:28:12|1:28:15|Doctor Niu stood up from the ground and looked down at the street below.
1:28:15|1:28:19|[Widow Ma] also looked up, staring straight at the culprit in front of her.
1:28:19|1:28:22|He then picked up the bag of medicine that had been thrown underneath.
1:28:22|1:28:26|At this moment, the young man ran breathlessly into the ancestral hall where [Niu Jieshi] lived.
1:28:47|1:28:58|[Doctor Niu] was stunned for a moment after hearing this, then immediately grabbed a knife and rushed over, with the young man closely following by his side.
1:28:58|1:29:17|Upon hearing the news, the crowd immediately scattered. Before long, a big knife pierced through the curtain, and the fool inside pointed outside. Then, [Niu Jieshi] appeared in the corridor, carrying the big knife on his shoulder, followed by a young man and a group of children holding sticks or kitchen utensils, shouting incessantly.
1:29:17|1:29:22|[Niu Jieshi] looked around and then saw a big knife chopping directly at a wooden door.
1:29:22|1:29:27|He then kicked open the wooden door with one swift motion, leading the children inside.
1:29:27|1:29:31|The leading child went in and immediately started throwing things around in [Doctor Niu]'s medicine box.
1:29:31|1:29:36|Other children following behind picked up things in Doctor Niu's house and threw them directly to the ground.
1:29:36|1:29:46|[Niu Jieshi] pulled back the curtain and walked in. He looked at the things inside, and in anger, he immediately waved the big knife in his hand, smashing the glass cabinet next to him into pieces.
1:29:46|1:29:57|At this moment, the fool shouted loudly while holding up a framed X-ray, "Key, key." [Niu Jieshi] heard it and walked out, taking the X-ray from the fool's hand and examining it carefully.
1:29:57|1:30:6|The fool standing behind walked over, pointed to the shadow of the key, then picked up the key around [Niu Jieshi]'s neck and compared it, finding them identical.
1:30:6|1:30:12|It suddenly dawned on [Niu Jieshi] that on the day when [Doctor Niu] examined him, his key was right in front of his chest.
1:30:12|1:30:18|After learning the truth, [Niu Jieshi] felt both wronged and angry, but his eyes became even more fierce.
1:30:54|1:31:3|[Widow Ma] stared straight at [Niu Jieshi], only to see [Niu Jieshi]'s face contort into a grimace, reaching out to slap [Widow Ma].
1:31:3|1:31:16|Niu Jieshi, feeling indignant, picked up the jar and prepared to hit Widow Ma. However, when she saw Widow Ma's tearful eyes staring back at her, Niu Jieshi's eyes also welled up with tears. Her lips quivered with anger, but she still didn't put down the jar.
1:31:16|1:31:24|[Widow Ma] turned around, leaning on the stairs, heard the sound of a bell, [Niu Jieshi] pushed [Widow Ma] up the stairs, walked to the roof, only to see her kick open the door with one foot, shouting loudly.
1:31:33|1:31:40|[Niu Jieshi] roared like a wild beast in anger, but soon he returned to the Widow Ma's house, only to find it empty.
1:31:40|1:31:44|He went downstairs and searched around, but there was still no sound in the house.
1:31:44|1:31:47|[Niu Jieshi] paced back and forth anxiously, as if on the verge of tears.
1:31:48|1:32:0|A pair of hands appeared on the railing of the second floor, [Niu Jieshi] looked up and saw [Widow Ma] sitting there quietly watching him. He looked at [Niu Jieshi] with a gentle smile, then gestured with his hands.
1:32:1|1:32:7|[Niu Jieshi] looked up at him with a furrowed brow, his eyes filled with both heartache and reluctance.
1:32:7|1:32:11|[Widow Ma] looked at him, shook her head sadly, and saw [Niu Jieshi] take a few quick steps, getting ready to go upstairs.
1:32:11|1:32:13|Widow Ma, upon seeing the situation, immediately clung to the railing, intending to jump down.
1:33:6|1:33:19|Following that, he bit open the abortion pills in his hand, and [Widow Ma] stared at him with wide eyes. [Niu Jieshi] cried as he tore the pills into pieces and stuffed them directly into his mouth. His hands trembled in fear, tears swirling in his eyes.
1:34:17|1:34:24|Back at the ancestral hall, [Niu Jieshi] burns the X-ray film in the stove. He sits quietly in front of the deity, lost in thought.
1:34:24|1:34:29|At this moment, [Niu Jieshi]'s face turned extremely haggard, and his lips became pale and shriveled.
1:34:29|1:34:42|Early the next morning, a few rays of sunlight shone through the cracks in the door, [Niu Jieshi] still sat motionless in place, the fire in the iron basin had already extinguished, the entire Changshou Town was still as quiet as usual, with no one in the alley.
1:34:42|1:34:49|At this moment, Widow Ma appears on the screen, clutching her stomach in pain, rolling on the bed and sweating profusely.
1:34:49|1:34:55|In a daze, she felt a hand on her belly, and immediately sat up and looked back, only to find no one there.
1:34:56|1:35:3|[Niu Jieshi] looked at the coffin behind him, then turned around, his eyes turning a steely gray. He looked helplessly into the distance and let out a deep sigh.
1:35:3|1:35:12|Before long, [Niu Jieshi] walked out from inside, locked the door of the ancestral hall, and then hung the key around his neck. His hair was disheveled, and his eye sockets were deeply sunken.
1:35:12|1:35:19|[Niu Jieshi] opened his mouth as if to say something, then draped a piece of cloth diagonally across his body and looked around.
1:35:31|1:35:39|In the empty courtyard, there was no response. [Niu Jieshi] smiled bitterly, pulling the makeshift coffin, laboriously taking each step forward.
1:35:39|1:35:43|After a while, he placed a jar and glasses on the stone steps.
1:35:50|1:35:54|[Niu Jieshi] looked at the tightly closed door, disappointedly lowering his head.
1:35:54|1:35:58|But after he left, the old man in the room quietly opened the wooden door.
1:36:14|1:36:21|After speaking, he looked up at the window upstairs, then slowly lowered his head, grabbed the coffin made by [Painter], and walked forward again.
1:36:27|1:36:44|[Niu Jieshi] carried his coffin board and the things he had stolen before, going from house to house to deliver them to each household. However, he received no response from anyone. They always waited until [Niu Jieshi] left before coming out from their doors, silently watching his departing figure.
1:36:44|1:36:53|[Niu Jieshi] understood that the people in the town didn't like him, so without any greetings, he quietly placed those things in front of the door, then left with the coffin board.
1:36:53|1:37:3|Inwardly desperate, [Niu Jieshi] quickly arrived at the exit of Changshou Town, with his head down, pulling the heavy coffin board with all his might, feeling as if his strength had been drained.
1:37:4|1:37:9|[Niu Jieshi] felt like every step was walking on nails, the pain piercing straight into his heart.
1:37:9|1:37:18|At this moment, he was unaware that a group of people was following behind him. [Niu Jieshi] vaguely heard the murmurs and stood still, hesitating to turn around.
1:37:18|1:37:29|After a while, he made up his mind, took a deep breath, slowly turned around, only to find everyone standing behind him silently looking at him. [Niu Jieshi] looked at everyone in front of him, and saw their throats move slightly.
1:37:31|1:37:45|Afterwards, he swallowed again, nodded silently, stopped bending down, and knelt directly on the ground.
1:37:45|1:38:2|In the country of Valou, [Niu Jieshi] looked at everyone in front of him with pleading eyes, then slowly reached out his hands and placed them on the uneven stone road, banging his head heavily on the ground. The sound of a woman crying could be heard from the crowd.
1:38:2|1:38:6|The woman standing across pursed her lips, tears shimmering in her eyes.
1:38:6|1:38:10|[Niu Jieshi] looked up at everyone, then bowed his head again and knocked it on the ground.
1:38:12|1:38:23|The sound of crying in the crowd grew louder. [Niu Jieshi] got up from the ground, his dry and pale lips pursed, his brows furrowed almost pleadingly as he looked at everyone standing in front of him.
1:38:27|1:38:38|[Niu Jieshi] trembled as he finished speaking, then he used his hands to support himself as he unsteadily stood up, unable to bear looking at the place where he had once lived and the neighbors he had teased before.
1:38:38|1:38:42|After pausing for a moment, he waved his hand as if nothing had happened.
1:38:46|1:38:50|After speaking, [Niu Jieshi] turned his head, afraid of being seen through the vulnerability in his heart.
1:38:50|1:38:56|The morning sun cast a light on his head, but it couldn't conceal the gloom that hung over him.
1:38:56|1:39:1|He walked firmly with determination in his eyes, but his legs seemed uncontrollably about to give way.
1:39:1|1:39:5|The short distance seemed to have drained all his strength.
1:39:5|1:39:10|Before long, [Niu Jieshi] had already dragged the coffin halfway up the mountain.
1:39:10|1:39:13|Suddenly, a baby's cry was heard in Changshou Town.
1:39:14|1:39:17|He suddenly stopped in his tracks and looked in the familiar direction.
1:39:17|1:39:24|He gazed foolishly for a long time, but soon he turned around, shouldered the coffin board, and continued to walk up the mountain.
1:39:29|1:39:32|The scene changes, and the camera shows the face of Doctor Niu.
1:39:32|1:39:35|He looked shocked, with a trickle of nosebleed slowly flowing out.
1:39:35|1:39:39|He stuck out his tongue and licked it, causing a panic to spread through him.
1:39:39|1:39:43|Immediately, he took off his gloves and then covered his nose with his hand.
1:39:43|1:39:51|He used his hand to staunch the continuously flowing nosebleed, tears mixed in with it, half of his face smeared with blood everywhere.
1:40:10|1:40:13|A few days later, [Doctor] came to Widow Ma's house again.
1:40:13|1:40:21|He stood on the roof, secretly watching the cloaked figure leaving. At the end of the line, a person with a basket turned around, and that person was [Widow Ma].
1:40:21|1:40:26|He looked at [Doctor], made a thank-you gesture with his hand, then immediately turned around and followed at the end of the line.
1:40:27|1:40:31|The fulfilled [Doctor] lay on the bed with a satisfied smile.
1:40:31|1:40:42|The scene shifts to the market where Niu Jieshi lives, leaving the town of Chengshou. He drags the coffin to a recessed cliff bottom, panting heavily, his lips already turning pale.
1:40:42|1:40:58|Following that, he tidied up his clothes a bit, the dryness in his throat made [Niu Jieshi] involuntarily lick his lips. After a while, he struggled to climb into the coffin, casting a lingering look towards Longevity Town. Then, he took out the music box he had once given to [Widow Ma].
1:40:58|1:41:3|[Niu Jieshi] blew off the dust on top and then placed it on his own coffin.
1:41:3|1:41:17|Accompanied by music and sounds, he slightly opened his eyes and gazed blankly at the sky. The camera followed the direction of [Niu Jieshi]'s gaze, gradually passing through the branches on the cliff, the clear sky above his head, which at this moment also turned into a vast ocean.
1:41:17|1:41:27|[Niu Jieshi] imagined himself as a little fish at the bottom of the sea. Unwilling to swim with the school of fish, he quietly swam in the opposite direction, determined to carve out his own world.
1:41:28|1:41:43|At this moment, with the yellow dust filling the screen, a motorcycle is speeding away into the distance. [Widow Ma], wearing a cloak, gets off the motorcycle and takes off her hat, letting out a sigh of relief. The driver of the motorcycle beside her looks at her and starts to smile, and then [Widow Ma] also smiles happily.
1:41:43|1:41:49|Afterwards, she turned around, picked up the child, and walked silently towards the distance. When she left, the motorcycle driver also turned around and left.
1:41:50|1:41:53|At this moment, the screen once again shows the smiling face of [Doctor].
1:41:53|1:41:59|[Niu Jieshi] seemed to see the image of [Widow Ma] holding the child, lying in the coffin with a contented smile.
1:41:59|1:42:4|Widow Ma, who successfully left, smiled from the heart as she held her child in her arms.
1:42:4|1:42:10|In the glow of the setting sun, she stood up straight, looking ahead, and slowly took a step forward.
1:42:10|1:42:13|[Widow Ma] holds her head high, savoring the hard-won freedom.
1:42:13|1:42:20|His eyes became determined, then he gently cradled the child's head and resolutely walked towards the unfettered distance.
1:42:20|1:42:27|A few days later, the [Doctor] returned to the place where [Niu Jieshi] was buried. By now, the cliff was covered with blooming flowers.
1:42:27|1:42:35|[Doctor] turned around with a smile, looking at the town of Changshou at the foot of the mountain, then looked up at the mountain top, where an old kite was hanging on a tree branch.
1:42:35|1:42:42|He whistled towards the sky, and the echo came back from the valley. Before long, the melody of the music box could be heard.
1:42:43|1:42:48|The Doctor turned around and looked at the grave of Niu Jieshi, which was covered with bananas and apples.
1:42:48|1:42:55|Afterwards, [Doctor] looked towards the town of Changshou at the foot of the mountain again, his face expressionless but his eyes as cold as an ice cellar.
1:42:55|1:43:4|In the town of Changshou, a group of people wearing black cloaks are lined up for a ceremony. The person lying on the wooden boat this time is the [Mayor], with people in front of him holding school rods.
1:43:5|1:43:15|At this moment, the crowd behind wearing cloaks suddenly stopped, tilted their heads up, and shouted towards the sky. Someone opened their mouth wide, with a fierce expression, and screamed at the sky with all their might.
1:43:15|1:43:29|The [Doctor] stood quietly on the top of the mountain, watching them. Suddenly, a large rock from a distant hilltop dropped many stone fragments, followed by a rumbling sound from the mountain. Soon, rocks of all sizes rolled down the slope rapidly.
1:43:30|1:43:44|The wooden stakes supporting the giant rock gradually couldn't hold up. At this moment, the huge rock at the top has slid to the edge of falling, and the inside stakes are bearing more and more weight until they can't support it and break, leaving only the outer stakes still holding strong.
1:43:44|1:43:55|Before long, the aged boulder rolled forward again, shattering the wooden beam underneath into pieces. Unable to hold on any longer, it finally plummeted from the mountain towards this ancient town.
