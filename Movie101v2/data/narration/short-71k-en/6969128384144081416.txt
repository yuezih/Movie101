0:1:59|0:2:8|The racing car, speeding along the forest road, roared loudly as [Xu Tailang], guided by the navigator, smoothly passed through one dangerous curve after another.
0:2:16|0:2:27|[Xu Tailang] wore a heavy helmet, staring ahead earnestly. The staff on the field were busy directing, with data updating constantly on the computer. [Xu Tailang] remained unaffected by the people around him.
0:2:27|0:2:34|Eyes fixed on the screen. The speeding race car kicked up a cloud of dust and gravel, inside the car, [Xu Tailang] focused on the road ahead.
0:2:34|0:2:39|Skillfully drifting through every massive curve in the race track, [Xu Tailang] showed no sign of hesitation in his movements.
0:2:39|0:3:2|With the changing road conditions, deftly switching between the brake and the accelerator, the race car quickly drove down the mountain road and entered a track filled with sand and rocks. The blue Subaru race car raced on this extremely rough mountain road, with the scenery on both sides quickly receding backwards. The mountain road was rugged and steep, and even a small mistake could lead to the race car veering off the narrow road and falling off the cliff.
0:3:2|0:3:19|Even in such thrilling road conditions, [Xu Tailang] drove the race car without slowing down at all. The car was tossed left and right by the gravel, the rapidly spinning wheels kicked up a cloud of dust, making the sun less glaring. The car continued to race on the sandy road among the bushes.
0:3:19|0:3:25|The road under the wheels is constantly changing, sometimes smooth asphalt, sometimes gravel road.
0:3:25|0:3:34|Sometimes he would also appear in the grass field. [Xu Tailang] looked ahead firmly, as colorful fireworks burst at the finish line of the racetrack.
0:3:34|0:3:43|[Xu Tailang]â€™s racing car crossed the finish line, and the team members were all smiles, expressing their inner joy and happiness by clapping and fist bumping.
0:3:44|0:3:54|The racing car drove through the cheering crowd on both sides and stopped. With people crowded around the car door, [Xu Tailang] took off his helmet, cheered, got out of the car, and hugged his teammates.
0:3:54|0:3:59|The reporter's microphone was promptly handed to [Xu Tailang] at this moment.
0:5:6|0:5:20|Amidst the cheers of the crowd, the father covered his mouth and turned away, while [Xu Tailang] also raised his hands in joy and looked at the people around him celebrating together. He stood excitedly on the roof of the car, savoring the victory that belonged to him at this moment.
0:5:20|0:5:28|After the hustle and bustle, [Xu Tailang] walked towards his father on the terrace, who was about to light a cigarette but stopped the motion.
0:5:29|0:5:37|Father then saw a streamer hanging on his shoulder, he took it off and stuffed it into his pocket.
0:6:7|0:6:14|The father paused and took the cigarette out of his mouth.
0:6:15|0:6:20|[Xu Tailang] drove the race car out of the parking lot.
0:6:20|0:6:32|In the middle of the road, [Xu Tailang] twisted his mouth, watching the speeding race car about to crash into him, he remained motionless, until the car made an emergency brake in front of him, he couldn't help but stagger.
0:6:32|0:6:36|[Xu Tailang] knocked on the car window and made a gesture to signal his father to get in.
0:6:37|0:6:44|The racing car speeds along a gravel road, with [Xu Zhengtai] wearing a helmet inside, looking very nervous.
0:6:46|0:7:1|[Xu Tailang] sneered at his nervous father, ignoring his pleas. He drifted around a sharp turn, kicking up a cloud of dust as the vehicle continued down a rural road. The mud and water did not slow down [Xu Tailang] at all, while [Xu Zhengtai] kept his eyes closed, feeling uncomfortable.
0:7:5|0:7:12|[Xu Tailang] fiercely turned the steering wheel, causing the race car to make a sharp turn again. With a half-smile on his face, [Xu Tailang] looked at his father in pain.
0:7:12|0:7:23|He skillfully operated every button, the speed of the car getting faster and faster. The race car flew towards the center of the tracks, and at that moment, a speeding train came towards him. [Xu Tailang] blacked out.
0:7:24|0:7:33|When [Xu Tailang] opened his eyes, he saw a doctor continuously patting himself, and it seemed like he was saying something.
0:7:44|0:7:49|At this moment, every detail of Xu Tailang's life flashes through his mind.
0:7:49|0:8:12|At the age of two, Xu Tailang first met his father in the visiting room of the prison. His father tried to reach the milk bottle through the barrier to feed his son. When the visiting time was up, his father left. At the age of five, at home, his father kicked over the neatly stacked building blocks made by Tailang, looking at Xu Tailang with a face full of disappointment, saying, "Playing with these every day, what future can you have?" After saying that, he staggered out.
0:8:12|0:8:18|At the age of 10, the teacher questioned the father, "Did you sign the paper?"
0:8:18|0:8:27|Father kicked Xu Tailang mercilessly, then kicked Xu Tailang again as he watched the car race, saying, "What are you, a child, watching a car race?"
0:8:27|0:8:32|[Xu Tailang] picked up a photo frame, the woman's face on it was blurry, and he held the album and called out "mom".
0:8:32|0:8:38|At the age of 18, at the skating rink, a girl skated towards [Xu Tailang], and he smiled and said, "Alang, I love you."
0:8:38|0:8:45|Before long, the girl sat in the back seat and apologized to [Xu Tailang], saying, "I'm sorry, I've fallen in love with someone else."
0:8:45|0:9:0|Watching the motorcycle ride away, [Xu Tailang] threw the rose in his hand onto the road. Injured, he arrived at a hair salon filled with a sensual atmosphere. After a passionate encounter, the landlady sat by the bed and gently asked [Xu Tailang], "How do you feel?"
0:9:0|0:9:22|At the age of 23 at the racing scene, [Xu Tailang] hung up the gear and told the coach that he felt nervous for the first time. The coach gestured outside the car to start the countdown. However, after the start, [Xu Tailang] drove the car into a ditch. The navigator angrily threw a glove and said, "Are you stupid? How can you drive into a ditch on a straight line? I will never be your navigator again." The sponsor pointed at [Xu Tailang]'s nose and said, "You will never have another chance."
0:9:22|0:9:28|The person in charge of the repair shop only gave him one word: Get lost.
0:9:31|0:9:50|Father opened the car door for [Xu Tailang] to get in, then the ambulance overturned. [Xu Tailang] called 120, "Hello, this is the ambulance, we need an ambulance." Father stood outside the clinic, angrily with his hands on his hips. He couldn't help but step forward and slapped [Xu Tailang]. Only the boss lady from the hair salon comforted him, saying, "Don't be sad."
0:9:50|0:9:56|Late at night, [Xu Tailang] was waving a bottle on the rooftop, slipped and fell. The next day,
0:9:56|0:10:5|[Xu Tailang] lay on the hospital bed, with the owner of the hair salon sitting on a chair beside him. He said while peeling a banana, "Drink less and go drive for my big brother."
0:10:5|0:10:9|That day, Big Brother ran up to the car panting and instructed [Xu Tailang].
0:10:9|0:10:16|The elder brother was closely followed by a group of people holding sticks, and [Xu Tailang] skillfully reversed the car, never being caught up by those people.
0:10:16|0:10:24|Seeing that the group of people could no longer catch up with the car, the big brother in the back seat looked relieved and said, "The car is driving well."
0:10:24|0:10:42|The eldest brother pointed proudly at a white sports car behind him, while [Xu Tailang] was doing sit-ups on the bed, with posters of beautiful women and race cars flashing before his eyes. [Xu Tailang] appeared again at the race track to participate in the competition. During the race, the navigator encouraged him to stay steady until he reached the finish line.
0:10:43|0:10:52|[Xu Tailang], who crossed the finish line, was surrounded by the crowd. Amidst the flashlights and flower garlands, [Xu Tailang] received the first championship trophy. He kissed the trophy deeply.
0:10:53|0:10:59|He then placed the trophy in front of his mother [Zhang Suzhen]'s grave, sharing the joy of his championship.
0:10:59|0:11:6|Returning to the scene of the accident, the racing car soared into the air, about to fly over the train tracks, the scene slowed down countless times.
0:11:6|0:11:29|When Xu Tailang's racing car flew into the center of the tracks, he turned his head and watched as the train approached step by step, while his father sitting in the passenger seat also stared in shock at the oncoming train. With a strong impact, the racing car spun two circles in the air.
0:11:29|0:11:34|With the car flipping over, it crashed heavily onto the side of the road and rolled over several times.
0:11:39|0:11:54|The unbearable weight caused the car window to shatter, scattering around the car body. The father and son inside the car tightly closed their eyes, secured by the seat belts, as the car kept flipping. The tremendous impact left them unable to make any protective moves.
0:11:54|0:12:1|The champagne inside the car was shattered in the impact. The trophy also fell down.
0:12:2|0:12:10|A fragment grazed Xu Tailang's cheek, leaving a long bloodstain. The car was thrown several tens of meters away when it was hit.
0:12:10|0:12:17|Xu Tailang slammed into the wall heavily before finally coming to a stop. Despite the car being in a terrible state,
0:12:17|0:12:22|However, the high-intensity crash beams inside the professional racing car kept the cockpit relatively intact.
0:12:22|0:12:30|The two unconscious people in the car were rescued in time. [Xu Tailang] wearing a respirator mask, opened his eyes in confusion.
0:12:30|0:12:38|He had already recalled his entire life. Through the eyes of [Xu Tailang], he seemed to see the blue sky and white clouds.
0:12:38|0:12:57|In his eyes, it seemed as if he was slowly rising into the air, passing through the thin mist to reach the thick clouds. The white clouds constantly changed colors under the sunlight, and as he navigated through the dense clouds, the words "riding the wind and breaking the waves" slowly appeared on the screen.
0:12:57|0:13:4|[Xu Tailang] pushed open a wooden door and walked out, looking around curiously.
0:13:4|0:13:13|The street here is filled with the quaintness of the 90s. Even though it's night time, the huge neon signs of the beloved KTV light up the whole street brightly.
0:13:13|0:13:18|[Xu Tailang] looked a bit confused, looking around at the passing pedestrians and streets.
0:13:18|0:13:26|He looked very unfamiliar and full of doubts at all this seemingly familiar. [Xu Tailang] suddenly saw a familiar figure.
0:13:26|0:13:32|At this moment, a middle-aged woman with a simple dress and long ponytail looked at him.
0:13:53|0:14:6|At this moment, hearing someone shouting, [Xu Tailang] didn't hesitate to chase after, closely following the thief without letting go. The thief agilely turned through one alley after another, but still couldn't shake off [Xu Tailang].
0:14:6|0:14:13|Watching as [Xu Tailang] was about to catch up to the thief, the thief suddenly stopped and turned around. It was then revealed that the thief pulled out a dagger from his leg.
0:14:13|0:14:20|Just now, [Xu Tailang], who was still aggressive, immediately backed down, turned around and started walking back. After a few steps, he suddenly muttered to himself.
0:14:21|0:14:32|[Xu Tailang] turned around and faced the thief charging at him with a knife, remaining calm. Suddenly, a motorcycle drove straight through the two of them.
0:14:32|0:14:39|A masked man in a black cloak descends from the sky, with two swords inserted behind his back.
0:14:40|0:14:48|The masked man casually threw off his cloak, while the thief cautiously watched him and pulled out another dagger, pointing it at [Xu Tailang].
0:14:49|0:14:56|The three individuals stared at each other for a long time, and the masked man slowly drew two one-meter-long swords from behind him, pointing them at the thief.
0:14:59|0:15:2|The thief looked at the small dagger in his hand and said.
0:15:4|0:15:25|After saying that, the thief threw away the dagger in his hand. The masked man also threw his long sword on the ground. Taking advantage of their distraction, the thief quickly picked up both swords. With a swing of one sword, [Xu Tailang] hurriedly grabbed the thief from behind. The masked man quickly kicked the thief down. The thief struggled to escape but was held by [Xu Tailang], who dragged him to the ground by his leg. He kicked [Xu Tailang] away, only to be knocked down again by the masked man.
0:15:35|0:15:46|After tying up the thief, the masked man stood up. He took off his helmet, pulled down his mask, revealing his true face. Xu Tailang was stunned, staring at the masked man in shock as he shouted.
0:15:49|0:15:54|The masked man said in confusion, "The two of them lost their belts, and their pants fell to the ground, when the police arrived."
0:16:3|0:16:12|[Xu Zhengtai] picked up the long sword on the ground and walked forward without looking back. Later, [Xu Tailang] was taken back to the police station by the police.
0:16:37|0:16:43|[Xu Tailang] looked at the 1998 calendar on the table, while the two police officers stared at him expressionlessly.
0:17:14|0:17:19|[Xiao Hua] sighed and drew the final stroke of the character "æ­£" on top of [Xu Zhengtai]'s head.
0:17:20|0:17:28|With a serious expression on his face, [Liu Yi] was playing cards and laughing. Suddenly, as if he saw something, he put down his pager and jumped into the river next to him.
0:17:28|0:17:37|[Xiao Hua] and [Xu Zhengtai] looked at [Liu Yi] in the river with puzzled expressions.
0:18:9|0:18:15|[Xu Zhengtai] saw [Xu Tailang] next to Director Jin, and Director Jin asked again.
0:18:17|0:18:25|[Xu Zhengtai] looked puzzled, [Xu Tailang] quickly gave him a signal with his eyes, and the two of them simultaneously said, causing Director Jin to roll his eyes at them.
0:18:56|0:19:4|[Xu Tailang] quickly came up with a clever idea and said.
0:19:36|0:19:42|Director Jin and police officer Xiao Sun immediately went upstairs to investigate.
0:19:55|0:19:58|[Xu Tailang] was stunned, trying hard to remember.
0:20:0|0:20:7|Director Jin shouted towards Sun Xiaos upstairs.
0:20:15|0:20:24|Xu Tailang put away his smile, and then Jin left. After confirming that the police had left, [Xu Zhengtai] turned around and looked at [Xu Tailang].
0:20:26|0:20:42|[Xu Zhengtai] picked up the walkie-talkie on the table and walked towards the second-floor terrace, with [Xu Tailang] following closely behind, looking around with joy and curiosity at everything. Standing next to the terrace, [Xu Zhengtai] looked at the curious [Xu Tailang] and asked seriously.
0:20:45|0:21:1|[Xu Tailang] was somewhat speechless. He glanced into the distance and, feeling powerless to explain, he obediently said.
0:21:7|0:21:20|[Xu Tailang] looked at [Xu Zhengtai], who was laughing, with a hint of helplessness. He turned around and sighed towards the distance.
0:21:22|0:21:30|[Xu Tailang] suddenly realized and muttered to himself.
0:22:7|0:22:14|[Xu Tailang] readily agreed without hesitation.
0:22:55|0:23:1|Zhengtai grabbed Liu Yi.
0:23:3|0:23:12|The exhausted group of four then arrived at the riverside road, shouting weakly. Upon hearing the barking of a dog, [Xu Zhengtai] immediately made a gesture for everyone to stop.
0:23:12|0:23:15|He identified the direction and chased after them, with three people following closely behind.
0:23:16|0:23:23|Four people struggled to climb onto the roof, hiding under the eaves and looking down. [Liu Yi] looked at the puppy tied to the car and said.
0:23:50|0:23:55|Seeing [Luo Li] walking towards them, the four of them instinctively ducked their heads back in unison.
0:24:0|0:24:7|Xiao Hua left, leaving the remaining three to discuss.
0:24:9|0:24:18|Later, at Xu Zhengtai's home, Xiao Hua was cooking in the kitchen.
0:24:19|0:24:26|[Xu Tailang] looked at the kitchen with anticipation on his face. [Xiao Hua] turned around and walked back.
0:24:33|0:24:39|The elder sister-in-law [Xiao Hua] lifted the door curtain and came out with a fish. [Xiao Hua] has a good appearance and looks very delicate.
0:26:27|0:26:36|[Xu Tailang] turned his head with a smile.
0:26:40|0:26:48|[Xiao Hua] continued to look towards the kitchen, while [Xu Tailang] calmly served [Xiao Hua] some dishes.
0:27:4|0:27:10|[Xu Tailang] smiled contentedly, then turned to [Xu Zhengtai] in the kitchen.
0:27:13|0:27:22|[Xu Tailang] waved goodbye to [Xiao Hua] and headed home. On a rainy night, [Luo Li]'s car swayed on the side of the road, and another car crashed into it.
0:27:22|0:27:31|The huge impact interrupted the intimacy of the couple [Luo Li]. He looked impatiently out the window.
0:27:32|0:27:40|Luo Li angrily got out of the car and cursed, feeling guilty when he saw the culprit.
0:28:2|0:28:10|[Luo Li] turned around and saw the high heels in front of the glass window. He took off the high heels and carefully put them on his wife's feet.
0:28:16|0:28:23|On the other side, Xu Tailang stood straight at the bridge wearing a white floral shirt, with a rose in his mouth.
0:28:23|0:28:31|[Xu Tailang] slowly turned around to find not only [Xiao Hua], but also [Xu Zhengtai] and [Liu Yi] approaching. Seeing this scene, the rose in his mouth withered.
0:28:31|0:28:41|[Xu Tailang] sat at the front of the motorcycle with a look of despair, while [Xu Zhengtai] rode the motorcycle confidently with a flower in his mouth. [Xiao Hua] hugged [Xu Zhengtai]'s waist, looking very happy.
0:28:41|0:28:48|They were followed closely by Liu Yi's motorcycle. Liu Yi was focused on the road ahead, with his goddess Jia Yi sitting behind him.
0:28:48|0:28:56|Jia Yi really enjoys the feeling of riding a motorcycle. [Liu Yi] couldn't help but smile when he took his goddess for a ride.
0:28:56|0:29:6|The group quickly arrived at the entrance of the cinema, locked the car, and then watched a tense and exciting Hong Kong movie at the cinema.
0:29:12|0:29:21|[Xiao Hua] brought back several bags of snacks to share with everyone.
0:29:50|0:29:57|[Liu Yi] sneaked out of the screening room and picked a rose from a rose bed.
0:30:15|0:30:24|Liu Yi, who was still unaware of the situation, ran over and asked, only to discover that the rose petals had already been squeezed out.
0:30:26|0:30:32|Jia Yi looked at the infatuated [Liu Yi] and refused. Jia Yi glanced at her watch.
0:30:49|0:31:0|[Xu Tailang] waved his hand and pulled [Liu Yi] over, looking at the dejected [Liu Yi] and comforting him. [Xu Zhengtai] sat back in his chair and said.
0:31:12|0:31:20|[Xu Zhengtai] took out a ring and presented it to [Xiao Hua]. [Xiao Hua] smiled and accepted the ring.
0:31:21|0:31:28|[Xiao Hua] puts the ring on her ring finger.
0:31:29|0:31:36|[Xu Zhengtai] joyfully embraces [Xiao Hua], while [Xu Tailang] pounds on the chair beside them, looking somewhat frustrated.
0:31:37|0:31:43|Early in the morning, Xu Zhengtai, Xu Tailang, and Liu Yi sat at a noodle stall.
0:31:46|0:31:52|The noodle master spat twice into his hands and vigorously kneaded the dough.
0:32:39|0:32:47|[Xu Zhengtai] quickly picked up the noodles that the master had placed on the book.
0:33:12|0:33:26|At night, the three of them arrived at the Beloved Song and Dance Hall, with [Xu Tailang] following [Xu Zhengtai] and [Liu Yi] inside.
0:34:47|0:34:54|Jiayi looked puzzled, but still followed her sisters out. [Xu Tailang] talked about negotiation skills.
0:35:30|0:35:43|Xu Tailang pointed at Xu Zhengtai's crossed hands, while Xu Tailang also crossed his hands. They gestured opening and closing their fingers a few times, and the three of them synchronously performed the same opening and closing movements. They then intuitively intertwined their fingers with each other.
0:35:44|0:35:50|At this moment, [Luo Li] stormed in with three henchmen, one of whom harassed Jia Yi outside the door.
0:36:1|0:36:8|[Luo Li] sneered disdainfully.
0:36:9|0:36:15|[Liu Yi] walked up to [Luo Li] with a fierce look after listening, muttering something under his breath without saying a word.
0:36:15|0:36:20|Luo Li, not hearing any sound, impatiently flashed a slap over.
0:36:22|0:36:32|[Luo Li] pulled out a gun to signal the two to sit back, then [Luo Li] sat on the sofa on the other side.
0:37:8|0:37:16|Tailang sat down next to [Luo Li] when he saw the situation.
0:37:35|0:37:45|After speaking, [Luo Li] stood up with a sneer and walked away under the gaze of Xu Zhengtai's group.
0:37:47|0:38:8|[Xu Zhengtai] smashed the glasses on the table with one kick, [Xu Tailang] followed up without hesitation with another kick, and [Liu Yi] also stepped on them. On the other side, [Luo Li] pulled the eye mask over Xiao Hua's eyes.
0:38:12|0:38:27|Xiao Ma was tied to a chair and unable to move. [Luo Li] squatted in front of him, feeding him spoonful by spoonful. [Luo Li]'s henchmen watched in disbelief, forgetting to eat their own food.
0:38:30|0:38:40|Luo Li and Xiao Hua locked eyes, placed the food basin on Xiao Hua's legs, and walked over to his subordinate for analysis. Then he glanced at Xiao Hua again.
0:39:14|0:39:20|Seeing Xiao Ma's reaction, [Luo Li] realized and covered his face, saying.
0:39:22|0:39:30|[Luo Li] looked at his henchman who had just suggested tearing up the tickets in frustration, and pulled out a gun.
0:39:33|0:39:42|The henchmen cowered in the corner in fear. After scaring them fiercely, [Luo Li]'s anger subsided a lot.
0:39:42|0:39:51|He furrowed his brow, scratched his head, and slammed the gun on the table. The gun suddenly went off, startling everyone.
0:39:51|0:40:6|[Luo Li] looked around in a panic, then pretended to calm down and straightened his clothes. Meanwhile, his subordinate pointed the muzzle of the gun on the table towards [Luo Li].
0:40:53|0:41:8|[Luo Li] looked thoughtfully at his subordinate, while on the other side, [Xu Zhengtai] led [Xu Tailang] and [Liu Yi] into his recording studio. [Xu Tailang] looked around curiously.
0:41:22|0:41:28|He then took [Xu Zhengtai]'s sunglasses and put them on, following [Xu Tailang] out of the recording studio.
0:42:28|0:42:33|[Xu Zhengtai] and [Liu Yi] quickly ran towards the restroom, while [Xu Tailang] lazily followed behind, leaning against the wall.
0:42:44|0:43:13|Xu Tailang's sack on his head was taken off, and he found himself in a car. Gritting his teeth, Xu Tailang shook off his sunglasses. He calmly observed the situation around him, then suddenly stretched his foot to hook the handbrake. The car made a sharp turn without warning. Xu Tailang took the opportunity to punch the kidnapper next to him, then opened the door and kicked him out. He stepped on the driver's right leg, causing the car to start swerving wildly.
0:43:17|0:43:28|[Xu Tailang] stepped on the driver's hand on the steering wheel with another foot, turned the steering wheel with his foot, then rushed forward to give the driver an elbow strike, and threw him out of the car. [Xu Tailang] quickly climbed into the driver's seat and took control of the car.
0:43:28|0:43:36|[Xu Zhengtai] stepped on the throttle of the motorcycle, [Xu Tailang] parked the bike in front of him.
0:43:46|0:43:56|Two people drove away in a car, at this moment Jin Suozhang and Xiao Sun walked out of a warehouse. They were about to ride a motorcycle when they were splashed all over by the car driven by [Xu Zhengtai].
0:43:57|0:44:1|Director Jin hurriedly sat on the sidecar motorcycle.
0:44:5|0:44:14|At this moment, [Luo Li] is on a date with his wife Matsuko. It is very quiet here, with a scenic picture of Mount Fuji in the background, and a table full of delicious Japanese cuisine.
0:44:53|0:44:56|Matsuko looked affectionately at [Luo Li] and raised her glass.
0:44:58|0:45:19|After speaking, she took the initiative to touch [Luo Li]'s wine glass and drank it all in one gulp. Feeling embarrassed, [Luo Li] lowered his head and also finished it in one go. After putting down the glass, he said to his wife.
0:46:14|0:46:22|[Xu Tailang] was outnumbered and knocked down to the ground. Just as [Xu Zhengtai] stood up, he was pushed onto the sofa by his henchman, and the two started grappling. [Xu Zhengtai] quickly dealt with the lackey beneath him with a punch, when suddenly another henchman swung an iron rod towards him.
0:46:40|0:46:48|Blindfolded and tied to a chair, [Xiao Ma] helplessly listened to the intense fighting around him, feeling completely lost.
0:46:48|0:46:57|Before long, [Luo Li]'s henchmen were knocked down by the two of them working together. While they were still groaning in pain, [Xu Tailang] did not hesitate, and decisively rushed to Xiao Ma's side.
0:46:57|0:47:6|He shouted for Xu Zhengtai, and the two of them carried Xiao Ma out with the chair, until Luo Li in the nearby warehouse received the message.
0:47:7|0:47:16|Xiao Ma, who was tied up, sat in the trunk in fear. The two of them rushed out without even closing the trunk door, while Director Jin and Xiao Sun were still squatting outside the warehouse door.
0:47:17|0:47:24|[Xu Zhengtai] drove out of the gate in a swift manner, leaving Director Jin shocked at the scene in front of him. He quickly instructed Xiao Sun to chase after.
0:47:24|0:47:37|Xiao Sun stepped on the gas pedal with all his might, but the motorcycle didn't start for a long time. Just then, [Luo Li] angrily ran out of the gate with a gun in hand, and Xiao Sun quickly crouched behind the motorcycle. [Luo Li] turned around and saw the police officer standing awkwardly in place.
0:47:37|0:47:44|On the ground, at night, Xu Zhengtai celebrates in front of the hot pot.
0:49:31|0:49:38|[Xu Tailang] stood up, feeling a bit at a loss for a moment.
0:50:47|0:50:51|[Liu Yi] pointed at [Xu Zhengtai] as if remembering something, then quickly ran to the second-floor terrace.
0:50:52|0:50:57|Upon reaching the terrace, [Liu Yi] leaned forward with hands on knees and shouted loudly into the distance.
0:51:18|0:51:21|[Xu Tailang] encouragedly patted Xiao Ma's shoulder, and Xiao Ma seemed lost in thought.
0:51:21|0:51:35|On the terrace, [Xu Zhengtai] handed a cigarette to [Liu Yi], comforting him by patting his head. [Liu Yi] took a deep drag, then choked and leaned against [Xu Zhengtai]. In the early morning, four people were sprawled out on the terrace in a tangled mess.
0:51:37|0:51:45|The next day, Xu Tailang went to Xiao Hua's house. Xiao Hua was sitting on the bed watching TV with her head in her hands when Tailang opened the door and walked in.
0:51:49|0:51:58|[Xu Tailang] answered with a sound, then he squatted down next to the TV and tried to press the switch, but the TV turned on just fine.
0:51:59|0:52:7|[Xu Tailang] couldn't help but glance at [Xiao Hua], trying to figure out what she meant. [Xu Tailang] squatted on the ground, stood up slowly, lost in thought.
0:52:8|0:52:13|After getting up, he looked around somewhat uncomfortably, and finally sat awkwardly on the TV cabinet, keeping a deliberate distance.
0:52:33|0:52:40|[Xu Tailang] stood with his hands on his hips, looking at [Xiao Hua] on the bed, and then slowly walked over while muttering to himself.
0:52:53|0:53:8|[Xu Tailang] sat on the edge of the bed and awkwardly touched his neck. [Xiao Hua] opened the window, letting the breeze brush through her hair, causing the side strands to sway in the wind. The sunlight gently sprinkled on [Xiao Hua]'s face, making her look particularly charming. She turned around and slowly sat down next to [Xu Tailang].
0:53:10|0:53:15|[Xu Tailang] leaned back slightly, supporting his body with both hands, looking at [Xiao Hua] with a smile that was not quite a smile.
0:53:15|0:53:24|[Xiao Hua] took off her hairband, and her hair gently brushed across [Xu Tailang]'s face. [Xu Tailang], who was teased, looked affectionately at [Xiao Hua] beside him. [Xiao Hua] whispered.
0:53:27|0:53:36|[Xu Tailang] stiffly turned his body to find the remote control, his hand gently brushing over [Xiao Hua]'s translucent coat as he switched TV channels.
0:53:40|0:53:53|With [Xiao Hua]'s hand already placed on [Xu Tailang]'s thigh, [Xu Tailang] gazed affectionately at [Xiao Hua], the remote control slipping from his hand involuntarily. He gently placed [Xiao Hua]'s head on the bed.
0:53:57|0:54:2|[Xiao Hua] calmly closed her eyes as [Xu Tailang] gently brushed the hair beside her cheek.
0:54:6|0:54:13|[Xu Tailang] kept playing with the hair beside [Xiao Hua]'s cheek repeatedly.
0:54:26|0:54:35|He took off his shirt while listening to Xiao Hua, who kept her eyes closed and continued speaking.
0:54:35|0:54:44|[Xu Tailang] closed his eyes and kissed slowly.
0:54:49|0:54:59|In the next second, just as he was about to kiss [Xiao Hua], [Xu Tailang] abruptly stopped his movement, contorting to support his body, and stood still for several seconds before coming to his senses.
0:54:59|0:55:3|He hurriedly got up and retreated to lean against the window.
0:56:7|0:56:17|[Xu Zhengtai] walked over and patted his shoulder, then [Xu Tailang] hesitated and said.
0:56:31|0:56:49|On the other side, the cabinet suddenly opened, [Liu Yi] climbed out with a gloomy face. He looked around with a sense of loss, and his gaze finally landed on [Xu Zhengtai]'s face. Wiping away tears, he slammed the door and left.
0:56:50|0:56:56|[Xu Zhengtai] chased out and found [Liu Yi] on a rooftop.
0:57:15|0:57:23|Zhengtai stood with his hands on his hips, looking at Liu Yi with his head down, and said somewhat helplessly.
0:57:25|0:57:31|Zhengtai looked at [Liu Yi], touched the back of his neck, and said thoughtfully.
0:57:38|0:57:45|Xu Zhengtai scratched his head for a long time after listening, frowned helplessly, turned away to deal with him. Liu Yi then turned to Xu Tailang.
0:57:49|0:57:55|[Xu Tailang] looked coldly into the distance without saying a word.
0:58:0|0:58:4|In the distance, fireworks suddenly burst into the sky, and three people watched the fireworks quietly.
0:58:4|0:58:11|[Xu Tailang]'s expression also became a little happier. At this moment, [Liu Yi] looked at the two silent figures and said to [Xu Zhengtai].
0:58:27|0:58:38|[Xu Tailang] looked into the distance as [Xu Zhengtai] walked over. Watching the fireworks, he asked without knowing the reason.
0:59:24|0:59:32|[Xu Tailang] turned back to look at [Xu Zhengtai] for a long time, then rushed to [Xiao Hua]'s home, but did not find her figure.
0:59:32|0:59:41|Looking at the empty house, [Xu Tailang] seemed a little at a loss. Then [Xu Tailang] ran along the river path, passing through one small alley after another.
0:59:41|0:59:50|Xu Tailang looked around searching for Xiao Hua's figure. He almost ran through every building, every corner of the town, not even the most remote place was missed.
0:59:52|0:59:56|The sun gradually moved towards the west, casting its light on the water surface.
0:59:56|1:0:1|The gentle breeze rustled the branches, bringing tranquility to the peaceful town. [Xu Tailang] found nothing.
1:0:1|1:0:7|He stood in the middle of the bridge with a heavy heart, looking around unwillingly. The sky had turned dark.
1:0:7|1:0:12|[Xu Zhengtai] is still on the rooftop, pacing back and forth with one hand in his pocket.
1:0:12|1:0:17|He took a deep drag on his cigarette, looked into the distance, and faithfully waited for [Xu Tailang].
1:0:17|1:0:24|[Xu Tailang] sat on the bus, leaning against the window, unconsciously falling asleep, with a look of exhaustion and loss on his face.
1:0:24|1:0:37|The night grew late, [Xu Zhengtai] blending into the darkness, yet he remained standing on the rooftop. In the deep night, the small town was quiet, while [Xu Tailang] sat wearily and helplessly by the wooden wall, watching the passersby.
1:0:37|1:0:42|After a day of running around, he was so exhausted that he buried his head deeply into his knees.
1:0:42|1:0:50|The next morning, [Xiao Hua] woke up [Xu Tailang] who was sleeping on the roadside.
1:1:50|1:2:0|[Xu Tailang] reminisced about his childhood experiences while [Xiao Hua] nodded gently, showing that she could relate.
1:2:13|1:2:22|[Xiao Hua] looked up at the sky, and [Xu Tailang] followed [Xiao Hua]'s gaze to the sky.
1:2:22|1:2:32|After gazing at the sky for a moment with anticipation, [Xu Tailang] spoke.
1:2:40|1:2:49|She comfortingly patted Xu Tailang's cheek, as Xu Tailang stared intently at Xiao Hua.
1:2:57|1:3:5|[Xu Zhengtai] took a sip from the bottle of wine and walked shoulder to shoulder with [Xu Tailang] to the riverside. Without responding, [Xu Tailang] spoke with a serious expression on his face.
1:3:56|1:4:5|[Xu Tailang] took the bottle of wine and took a sip while looking into the distance.
1:4:12|1:4:25|In the distance, a black smoke rose up. As the fireboat was on its way, Xu Zhengtai ran ahead, leaving Xu Tailang and the fireboat far behind.
1:4:25|1:4:33|Xu Tailang and Xu Zhengtai ran to the door of Xu Zhengtai's house, one in front and one behind. They stopped and looked closely, only to see that the raging fire inside had already lit up the entire house.
1:4:33|1:4:37|[Xu Zhengtai] rushed in without hesitation, [Xu Tailang] hesitated for a moment, then quickly followed.
1:4:37|1:4:41|[Xu Zhengtai] pulled open the security door, kicked open the wooden door inside fiercely, and squeezed into the raging fire.
1:4:42|1:4:47|[Xu Tailang] covered his mouth and nose in a panic, covered his head with his clothes, and rushed in.
1:4:47|1:4:56|The roaring flames filled the entire room, and the thick smoke could be seen even in the farthest part of the small town. Two figures in black clothes, holding black umbrellas, watched the thick smoke in the distance before turning and leaving.
1:4:57|1:5:5|[Xu Zhengtai] and [Xu Tailang] are leaning against the bridge with a portrait and an urn in their arms, their faces covered in soot.
1:5:41|1:5:52|[Xu Zhengtai] turned the frame in his hand to the back, opened the back panel, and inside were neatly arranged banknotes of different denominations.
1:6:11|1:6:19|[Xu Zhengtai] [Xu Tailang] and [Liu Yi] walked to a small alley, and when [Xu Tailang] noticed that there was no one around, he stopped and said to the other two.
1:6:27|1:6:35|[Xu Tailang] resisted the urge to roll his eyes and pulled out a chopstick from the nearby window.
1:6:37|1:6:41|[Xu Tailang] exerted force to break the chopsticks, but they didn't budge until he used all his strength to snap them.
1:6:41|1:6:45|[Xu Tailang] is holding a pair of chopsticks that have been broken into two pieces.
1:6:46|1:6:52|[Xu Tailang] pulled out three chopsticks from the window again.
1:6:54|1:7:6|[Liu Yi] took the chopsticks in confusion and gently broke them apart. [Liu Yi] looked at [Xu Zhengtai], then at [Xu Tailang]. [Xu Tailang] embraced the two of them.
1:7:22|1:7:29|The man in front of them turned his back and lit a cigarette.
1:7:40|1:7:43|The man stood with one hand in his pocket, flicking the cigarette butt onto the ground.
1:8:58|1:9:4|The man lifted his head and slowly turned around, [Xu Tailang] couldn't help but move forward and stared at the man.
1:9:40|1:9:53|The thug swung the stick fiercely towards Xu Zhengtai's leg, causing his face to contort in pain, unable to speak. Xu Tailang lay on the ground unconscious.
1:10:13|1:10:21|[Xu Tailang] couldn't help but stand up, and somewhat dazedly pulled over [Xiao Hua], who was standing to the side looking somewhat annoyed.
1:11:44|1:11:52|At this moment, [Xiao Hua] was already looking out the window on the train.
1:14:12|1:14:18|The couple ignored the argument between [Xu Tailang] and the photographer, and kissed intimately. Xiao Hua sat on the train.
1:14:23|1:14:28|The train shuttles through a dense forest towards the distance.
1:14:31|1:14:38|Today is the wedding day of [Xu Zhengtai], and the wedding ceremony is held at the beloved KTV, with a very romantic decoration.
1:14:38|1:14:43|The guests were all seated, lively and bustling. Even those without seats were standing and eating without any complaints.
1:14:43|1:14:50|Occasionally, there were girls accompanying the guests, but the couple was discussing in the corridor.
1:15:6|1:15:17|Xu Zhengtai furrowed his brow, while Xu Tailang anxiously scanned the crowd still eating.
1:15:24|1:15:32|At this moment, [Liu Yi], who was still at home, put on the suspenders that [Xu Zhengtai] wore when he caught the thief.
1:15:32|1:15:40|After adjusting the tightness, he inserted two long swords into it. [Liu Yi] rarely had such a serious expression, and walked out with a resounding and powerful stride.
1:15:40|1:15:51|Carrying a bundle of rope in his hand, wearing a white tank top that revealed the tattoos on his arms, and empowered by the twin swords, [Liu Yi] strode aggressively down the hallway filled with elderly people.
1:15:51|1:16:9|He stood on a rooftop, looking expressionless towards the distance. He secured one end of a rope, and threw the other end down from the rooftop. After putting on gloves, he stood at the edge of the rooftop, holding onto the rope and looking down. The towering building made [Liu Yi], who exuded a strong aura, involuntarily gasp for breath, then he leaped down.
1:17:57|1:18:2|Huang Zhiqiang is discussing work with the lawyer in the office, while [Liu Yi] is hanging in mid-air, desperately hitting the office window.
1:18:4|1:18:12|The bodyguard immediately put down the newspaper and brought [Liu Yi] to the front of Huang Zhiqiang.
1:18:49|1:18:55|After saying that, [Liu Yi] prepared to draw his sword and make a big move, but it took him a long time to finally pull out the sword.
1:19:2|1:19:14|Huang Zhiqiang quickly pulled out an umbrella as Liu Yi rushed over. Xiao Hua and Xu Zhengtai stood hand in hand in front of the stage, while Xu Tailang danced joyfully on the side.
1:19:40|1:19:46|On the other side, [Liu Yi] glared with a ferocious expression as Huang Zhiqiang's umbrella plunged straight into his heart.
1:19:48|1:19:53|[Liu Yi] still stubbornly raised his head and said.
1:20:25|1:20:32|The body of [Liu Yi] lay on the ground, surrounded by bodyguards who seemed accustomed to such scenes.
1:20:34|1:20:42|[Xu Zhengtai] danced excitedly on the stage, gave a big hug to [Xu Tailang], and then tightly embraced the couple.
1:20:42|1:20:51|[Xu Tailang] held onto [Xiao Hua] unwilling to let go, [Xiao Hua] and [Xu Zhengtai] affectionately patted [Xu Tailang] on the back. The scene then cut back to the office.
1:20:51|1:21:0|The body of [Liu Yi] lay on the cold floor with eyes wide open. Later, the body was taken to the morgue.
1:21:1|1:21:6|[Jia Yi] wore a black dress and went to the morgue to see [Liu Yi] for the last time.
1:21:6|1:21:38|In the pouring rain, the golden retriever Mumu sat at the entrance of the morgue unwilling to leave for a long time. It seemed to see the confident Liu Yi under the street lamp, the Liu Yi who admired Chow Yun-fat in the movie, the Liu Yi who boasted at the dinner table, the Liu Yi who carefully touched Xu Zhengtai's motorcycle, and the Liu Yi who rode the motorcycle into the cinema with a twist of the throttle.
1:21:41|1:21:50|The one who is working hard to train by hitting the sandbag upside down is aiming to fight the world together with [Xu Zhengtai] and [Liu Yi].
1:21:50|1:22:0|The one who was being chased and miraculously found his big brother, [Liu Yi], happily took [Jiayi] for a ride on a motorcycle.
1:22:4|1:22:29|[In the scene, Liu Yi, who was demonstrating the secret code with his brothers, froze in that moment. Back in reality, Xu Zhengtai and Xu Tailang arrived at the morgue, with Xu Zhengtai squatting on the ground crying loudly. That night, Xu Zhengtai squatted at the door and burned paper money for Liu Yi.]
1:22:30|1:22:41|He took a cigarette from behind his ear, looked at it, and gently threw it into the fire. [Xu Zhengtai] stood up, exchanged a glance with [Xu Tailang] beside him, and the two of them confidently left, straightening their collars.
1:22:41|1:22:47|The next day, Xu Tailang and Xu Zhengtai, with suppressed anger, arrived at the office.
1:22:47|1:23:0|Xu Zhengtai and Xu Tailang burst into Huang Zhiqiang's office, which was in a mess and already deserted. Apart from scattered blueprints on the floor, they found nothing.
1:23:0|1:23:8|The two ran outside, where two cars belonging to Huang Zhiqiang were sealed off at the door. [Xu Zhengtai] casually opened the door of one of the cars.
1:23:20|1:23:31|[Xu Tailang] smiled without saying a word, opened the car door. The two of them searched around in the car, but couldn't find any trace of the keys.
1:23:32|1:23:35|Suddenly a hand holding a key reached out from the window.
1:23:36|1:23:43|[Xu Tailang] looked at [Luo Li] in confusion, then glanced at [Xu Zhengtai]. Seeing that [Luo Li] meant no harm, [Xu Tailang] hesitated for a moment before accepting the key.
1:23:50|1:23:56|[Xu Zhengtai] took the note and silently read the address, then glanced at [Luo Li]. He pretended to be calm and said.
1:24:15|1:24:26|[Luo Li] stared blankly as the racing car swiftly drifted through two corners and disappeared from sight. He remained silent.
1:24:26|1:24:34|[Xu Zhengtai] was scared by Taro's speed, his eyes widened as he was thrown against the glass by the inertia of the drift.
1:24:34|1:24:39|Another sharp turn, the wheels kicking up dust as they scraped past the roadside in an instant.
1:24:39|1:24:47|The car sped through bridges, riversides, and town streets, maneuvering through the narrow streets of the small town with various road conditions calmly handled by [Xu Tailang].
1:24:49|1:24:59|After being directed the wrong way by [Xu Zhengtai], [Xu Tailang] quickly turned the car around. At that moment, a Suzuki Alto was approaching head-on, and [Xu Tailang] actually lifted half of the car sideways, scraping past a nearby bus with the chassis.
1:25:1|1:25:11|[Xu Tailang] raised the corners of his mouth and continued to drive the car, swiftly shuttling through the streets. In the narrow alley where only one small car could pass through, [Xu Tailang] was actually speeding along.
1:25:11|1:25:21|[Xu Zhengtai] cautiously glanced at [Xu Tailang]'s skillful operation, then quietly looked away. After crossing the last street, the car made a sharp turn and stopped in front of an alley. The two got out of the car.
1:25:21|1:25:28|At this moment, Huang Zhiqiang casually walked out with two bodyguards, while Xu Zhengtai and Xu Tailang aggressively blocked the alleyway.
1:25:28|1:25:36|Upon seeing Huang Zhiqiang, Xu Tailang and Xu Zhengtai rolled up their sleeves and walked into the alley, with the bodyguard rushing over upon seeing the situation.
1:25:37|1:25:46|[Xu Tailang] picked up the washboard next to him, and [Xu Zhengtai] quickly knocked Huang Zhiqiang's bodyguard to the side. Unexpectedly, more thugs appeared in the corridor on the second floor, instantly enveloping the two of them.
1:25:47|1:25:53|[Xu Zhengtai] and [Xu Tailang] charged forward without showing any weakness, the two of them fighting their way from one end of the alley to the other as if completing a level in a video game.
1:25:54|1:26:0|[Xu Zhengtai] grabbed a bamboo basket and smashed it forward, while [Xu Tailang] threw over his shoulder and knocked down the four thugs behind.
1:26:0|1:26:7|Xu Tailang picked up a window and smashed it on the thug's head, then turned around and squatted down to face the enemy behind him.
1:26:7|1:26:15|[Xu Zhengtai] blocked the people in front, while [Xu Tailang] stopped the people behind. The two of them, in perfect coordination, were not harmed in the slightest even though there were many enemies.
1:26:15|1:26:25|[Xu Zhengtai] asked [Xu Tailang] to quickly go after Huang Zhiqiang, attempting to stop the group alone. Soon, [Xu Zhengtai] was outnumbered and fell to the ground, surrounded by the group who started punching and kicking him.
1:26:25|1:26:30|He seized the opportunity to struggle to get up, hiding in a room and tightly blocking the door.
1:26:30|1:26:36|On the other side, [Xu Tailang] shuttles through various alleys, searching for the whereabouts of Huang Zhiqiang.
1:26:40|1:26:45|[Xu Zhengtai] limped up the stairs, only to be kicked down by a foot coming towards him.
1:26:45|1:26:50|In the narrow corridor, the thug ran towards [Xu Zhengtai] and Xu Zhengtai quickly dodged backwards.
1:26:50|1:26:58|[Xu Tailang] was surrounded by several thugs, using a plastic basin to resist desperately, but was still kicked hard to the ground.
1:26:58|1:27:5|[Xu Zhengtai] is also having a tough time here, he is cornered in the kitchen and the fierce attacks from the opponent leave [Xu Zhengtai] powerless to fight back.
1:27:5|1:27:13|Suddenly, [Xu Zhengtai] grabbed a piece of meat from the ground, seized the opportunity, and fiercely slapped the thug's face, causing him to stumble and fall to the ground.
1:27:13|1:27:21|[Xu Zhengtai] used a piece of meat to tightly strangle the thug's neck, making him gasp for air. [Xu Tailang] grabbed a wet mop.
1:27:22|1:27:27|He knocked down three people with a slap in the face. On the other side, the thug was choked unconscious by [Xu Zhengtai].
1:27:27|1:27:36|Angry [Xu Zhengtai] stopped himself just as he was about to punch the unconscious thug. After hesitating for a moment, he got up and ran out to continue searching for Huang Zhiqiang.
1:27:36|1:27:41|The thug who was choked unconscious slowly got up and chased after [Xu Zhengtai].
1:27:41|1:27:50|[Xu Zhengtai] ran to a corridor, with several thugs chasing closely behind. [Xu Zhengtai] agilely flipped over a railing and casually threw a flower pot at the thugs' faces.
1:27:50|1:27:54|[Xu Zhengtai] kicked away another thug and hurriedly ran through this corridor.
1:27:54|1:28:0|[Xu Tailang] desperately climbed up the stairs, but was grabbed by the thugs from behind, who caught his ankle.
1:28:0|1:28:6|Two people were wrestling on the ground, with [Xu Tailang] gaining the upper hand only to be kicked off balance by a thug.
1:28:6|1:28:12|Xu Tailang, who hadn't even stood firm, picked up a chair and smashed it over, while the thug kicked towards Xu Tailang at the same time. Xu Tailang unexpectedly flipped over the railing.
1:28:12|1:28:19|[Xu Tailang] hung in mid-air, holding onto the railing tightly with both hands. At this moment, Huang Zhiqiang appeared, taking out a beer bottle from the side.
1:28:19|1:28:28|He walked slowly to [Xu Tailang] and forcefully smashed his hand.
1:28:28|1:28:36|Huang Zhiqiang frowned as [Xu Tailang] desperately clung to the railing, his fingers covered in shards of glass. Just as Huang Zhiqiang was about to stab [Xu Tailang] with the broken bottle neck,
1:28:36|1:28:43|[Xu Zhengtai] arrived just in time and was pierced by wooden spikes. Huang Zhiqiang pulled [Xu Zhengtai] and flipped him off the bridge.
1:28:45|1:28:54|[Xu Tailang] couldn't hold on to the railing and let go.
1:28:54|1:29:1|Fortunately, [Xu Zhengtai] and Hao Zaiqi fell onto the middle platform, while Huang Zhiqiang fell to the bottom layer, completely losing all vitality.
1:29:1|1:29:8|The two people struggled and recovered after a brief rest.
1:29:15|1:29:24|Two people covered in blood leaned against the railing.
1:30:18|1:30:28|At this moment, the roar of the plane came from above, [Xiao Hua] looked up, three planes flew past overhead, leaving long trails in the sky.
1:30:28|1:30:36|Her eyes welled up with tears, she held back the tears and helped [Xu Zhengtai] back. A few days later, a black umbrella floated away with the water.
1:30:48|1:30:54|After Xu Zhengtai was sentenced by the court, the screen flashed with precious memories of Xu Zhengtai.
1:30:54|1:31:8|On the nostalgic rooftop, they rode motorcycles together, went to the cinema. In the cinema, [Xiao Hua] and [Xu Tailang] slept beside him, while only [Xu Zhengtai] stared intently at the Hong Kong film.
1:31:11|1:31:19|On the bed, the box was opened, filled with Xu Zhengtai's stash of pagers. In the video hall, they ultimately couldn't keep it open.
1:31:25|1:31:32|Without the coaxing of [Xu Zhengtai], the beloved KTV also had its sign taken down. Inside, the unemployed hostess stood silently at the door.
1:31:32|1:31:40|[Xu Tailang] anxiously paced outside the hospital delivery room, looking forward to facing his younger self. Several hours later, the child was born.
1:31:40|1:31:47|[Xu Tailang] squatted in front of the child, and looked at the weak [Xiao Hua] again. [Xiao Hua] closed her eyes, with a tear still lingering at the corner of her eye.
1:31:47|1:31:56|[Xu Tailang] timidly grabbed the flailing little hand in the swaddle. The hospital corridor rapidly tilted backwards, as if a time machine.
1:31:56|1:32:2|Walking through the long corridor, a beam of light at the end was so bright that it made it hard to open one's eyes.
1:32:5|1:32:11|In the next moment, [Xu Tailang] slowly opened his eyes while lying on the hospital bed, and he struggled to turn to the other side.
1:32:11|1:32:17|The father Xu Tailang sat hunched over on another sickbed, eating his meal. There were four playing cards on the table.
1:32:17|1:32:27|Sensing his son's gaze, [Xu Zhengtai] turned to look at him. Seeing his son wake up, [Xu Zhengtai] smiled slightly with satisfaction as he looked at him.
1:32:28|1:32:36|The son lying down, tears in his eyes, looked at his father with white hair beside him, trying hard to open his mouth but unable to make a sound.
1:32:36|1:32:44|Xu Tailang then struggled to raise his hands, his ten weak fingers interlocking as he looked towards his father.
1:32:44|1:32:48|He gently grasped and then released it, repeating the action twice.
1:32:48|1:32:51|The two of them gazed at each other slowly.
1:32:52|1:33:1|[Xu Zhengtai] saw this movement seemed to trigger some memories. After a moment of daze, he tugged at the corner of his mouth and slowly stretched out his hands to make the same movement.
1:33:2|1:33:9|The scene cuts back to Xu Tailang traveling back to 1998, driving through the woods with a young Xu Zhengtai.
1:33:9|1:33:16|After witnessing Tailang's driving skills in the car, [Xu Zhengtai] remarked.
1:33:33|1:33:41|The film is about to say goodbye to you here. Thank you for listening. The final part of the film will bring you a post-credits scene.
1:33:41|1:34:2|Now I will tell you about the post-credits scene. [Xu Tailang] travels back to before the two got married, but with some changes. In the KTV, [Xu Zhengtai] and [Tailang] watch as the hostess sings, with [Tailang] holding the microphone and [Zhengtai] tapping along to the beat.
