0:4:0|0:4:7|[Li Tianran] and senior sister saw [Zhu Qianlong] take out a land deed from his bosom.
0:4:37|0:4:49|[Zhu Qianlong] bowed with his fists, then suddenly drew a gun and shot the master in the forehead. With another shot, the master fell to the ground.
0:4:58|0:5:20|[Zhu Qianlong] approached [Li Tianran], who was so scared that he knelt on the ground. The gun slowly approached, but [Li Tianran] managed to dodge four shots. As he chased [Li Tianran] out of the house, [Li Tianran] fell to the ground in response.
0:5:27|0:5:41|The raging fire immediately ignited on the body, engulfing the house. Under the cover of night, the two escaped from the manor. Two figures swiftly ran down the hillside, quickly getting into the car and driving away into the desolate snowy landscape.
0:5:43|0:6:3|Unexpectedly, another car turned at the intersection, and the two cars nearly collided. The person in the car, [Doctor Hendler], angrily criticized their driving skills. As he turned around, [Doctor Hendler] noticed the fire on the mountaintop. He quickly slammed on the brakes and looked over, only to see a figure with flames behind them, shouting as they ran down the hillside.
0:6:4|0:6:11|Doctor Hendler looked in horror at the newcomer, none other than Li Tianran who had narrowly escaped death. He clung to the front of the car, screaming in agony.
0:6:15|0:6:19|The title "Evil Forces" is introduced by the sound of four gunshots.
0:6:19|0:6:27|American doctor [Doctor Hendler] adopted [Li Tianran] and kept him in San Francisco to protect him. Fifteen years later,
0:6:27|0:6:49|[Li Tianran] practices shooting in the jungle with a gun in each hand. On the training ground, [Li Tianran] wields a knife to chop off wooden stakes, runs long distances on the road. Through repeated shooting and chopping, day after day, he hones his skills, developing strong arms, agile movements, and precise marksmanship with unwavering determination.
0:6:49|0:6:55|In the jungle, Li Tianran runs easily across the log, then steps up to the obstacle net and climbs up with all his strength.
0:6:59|0:7:6|The car brought him to the manor. In the office, the chief approved Li Tianran's application. Li Tianran was very excited, finally able to return to Beijing.
0:8:37|0:8:45|[Li Tianran] imitated it once and asked how to continue the next line. The officer patted his forehead twice with the back of his hand, and [Li Tianran] followed suit.
0:8:54|0:9:9|The sound of the train whistle pierced the sky, the cold of the snow-covered Beiping was intense, and the branches on both sides of the railway were covered with ice chips. The eaves of the drum tower were also covered with thick snow, everything looked like a silver world.
0:9:9|0:9:17|On the train, [Li Tianran] looked at the appearance of Beiping like this, expressing a deep longing for his hometown as an outsider.
0:9:17|0:9:24|Will the justice that [Li Tianran] yearns for in his heart be able to prevail before long on this land soon to be engulfed in flames?
0:9:24|0:9:48|The train slowed down, the front of the train emitted hot air, the insignificant hot air also tried to melt the chill that enveloped the sky over Beiping. A figure came against the railway tracks, a middle-aged man wearing a top hat and a neat overcoat, staring at the train's windows as he walked slowly. [Li Tianran] was carrying two large suitcases to greet his father who was approaching, this middle-aged man was none other than [Doctor Hendler].
0:11:45|0:11:57|The car slowly stopped at the door, [Lan Qingfeng] was pushing his bicycle out, greeted the two, the father closed the car door, [Lan Qingfeng] pushed the bike closer to [Li Tianran].
0:12:37|0:12:45|[Lan Qingfeng] hummed a song as he rode away on his bicycle.
0:13:47|0:14:0|[Zhu Qianlong] and [Lan Qingfeng] stepped back together, with [Lan Qingfeng] signaling that they could begin. The two of them knelt down slowly, then prostrated themselves on the ground, kowtowing. The portrait of Zhu Yuanzhang on the wall was gently shaken by the kowtowing, but the two of them showed no intention of stopping.
0:14:1|0:14:20|After performing the kowtow three times, the two finally stood up. [Zhu Qianlong] rubbed his eyes, tears seemed to be hanging at the corners of his eyes. He walked slowly towards the portrait, and the [Zhu Qianlong] next to the portrait mimicked the same posture.
0:16:29|0:16:41|[Lan Qingfeng] took a puff of his cigar, smiling as he looked at [Zhu Qianlong]. [Zhu Qianlong]'s expression changed immediately, realizing that the other party was not joking.
0:17:13|0:17:19|When they were in high spirits, the two clinked glasses and drank happily.
0:19:32|0:19:42|Approaching, the subordinate whispered a few words, [Zhu Qianlong] had just picked up a dumpling, but then he put it back on the plate.
0:21:35|0:21:58|[Li Tianran] stared at his father's eyes intently, and his father met his gaze without flinching. The car drove out of the back door of the [Lan family] at night, and [Lan Qingfeng] at the door smiled as he watched [Zhu Qianlong]'s car leave. Not long after the car drove away, a figure leaped onto the roof with a push of his hands, quietly following the car on the roof without anyone noticing. Meanwhile, [Doctor Hendler] paid a visit to [Lan Qingfeng].
0:22:10|0:22:32|Cars drove by on the street, while a figure chased relentlessly on the snow-covered eaves. The agile figure was none other than Li Tianran, who was eager for revenge. The car turned into an alley, Li Tianran made a turn and leaped over the roof, while on the other side, Doctor Hendler was visibly emotional.
0:23:7|0:23:25|On the roof, [Li Tianran] leaped into the courtyard with arms outstretched. After he entered the house and closed the door with a muttered curse, he turned on the light, took off his mask, and leaned back on the bed, looking at himself in the mirror. Breathing heavily, [Li Tianran] took a nut from the small table.
0:26:2|0:26:16|[Li Tianran] took the opportunity to blend in with the doctors who were being driven out and left. He walked through the corridor, turned onto a small path and went upstairs. Passing through several room doors, he arrived in front of the mirror in the injection room. He took off his mask and washed his face.
0:26:20|0:26:42|Suddenly, the sound of the door opening was heard, and [Li Tianran] immediately became alert. He gently turned off the tap and walked slowly towards it. Upon reaching the curtain, a well-dressed woman's figure was reflected in it. Seeing this, [Li Tianran] slowly put on his mask. Unexpectedly, the curtain was suddenly pulled open by the other party, revealing a charming beauty who claimed to be looking for [Doctor Hendler].
0:27:14|0:27:27|[Li Tianran] walked out of the curtain in a daze, and a beautiful woman in a cheongsam was splitting her legs. As [Li Tianran] looked over, lace panties were hanging on the screen. He lifted the cheongsam and used alcohol cotton to wipe the woman's crotch.
0:27:44|0:27:57|[Tang Fengyi] pushed away [Zhu Qianlong] who was about to kiss her on the butt. [Zhu Qianlong] opened the door and left, at this moment [Li Tianran] came out from behind the curtain holding a syringe. [Li Tianran] readily agreed to his request.
0:27:58|0:28:5|After a simple disinfection, the needle was immediately inserted, and as the syringe advanced, [Tang Fengyi] showed a look of enjoyment.
0:28:17|0:28:22|On the other side, in the hospital, [Tang Fengyi] was flirting with [Li Tianran] in high spirits.
0:28:32|0:28:45|Later, he took out a tip and a business card, letting [Li Tianran] choose. After a moment of hesitation, [Li Tianran] took the tip. [Tang Fengyi], displeased, glanced at him and then picked up her coat from the hanger and walked straight out the door. [Li Tianran] turned around, and the underwear left on the screen swayed in the wind.
0:28:47|0:28:51|[Li Tianran] hurried to the window and watched as the car drove out of the hospital below.
0:28:52|0:29:1|He guessed that the person in the car was most likely [Zhu Qianlong] who had just left. [Li Tianran] put on his coat and quickly walked out, then jumped from the window of the stairs to the roof.
0:29:1|0:29:26|He used both hands and feet to climb quickly to the highest point of the roof, and with a push of his arms, he vaulted over. Then he quickly arrived at a poplar tree, realizing he had to cross the road to catch up. So, [Li Tianran] stepped on the power line and slowly passed over the road. In front of him was a vast expanse of roofs, densely packed and orderly. For [Li Tianran], who had trained for many years, it was like walking on flat ground. His figure moved lightly and swiftly.
0:29:26|0:29:33|Li Tianran easily crossed over the eaves one by one, swiftly climbed up the beams, as if this place was his home turf.
0:29:33|0:29:45|Outside the city, the car raced away, kicking up clouds of yellow dust. [Li Tianran], who was running desperately, was blocked by a moat. In a hurry, he had to detour through the woods to catch up, while the car was almost reaching its destination.
0:29:45|0:29:49|[Zhu Qianlong] walked into the execution ground.
0:30:13|0:30:21|[Zhu Qianlong] shot dead Chinese people, but he gained the support and admiration of the people, and he climbed onto a car waving his hand in a majestic manner.
0:33:42|0:34:10|On this sunny day, Li Tianran stepped out of the house in the early morning, walking through the streets and alleys bathed in sunlight. The cold winter had already passed, with the sound of cicadas everywhere, and the bustling alleys of Beiping were filled with constant shouts of vendors. Li Tianran dodged the cars and crossed to the other side of the road, jumping to burst a pig bladder, and approached a thin man.
0:34:30|0:34:50|[Li Tianran] finally caught up, but the smoker had already run away for a while. [Li Tianran] trained day and night to improve his running, naturally surpassing the smoker. The smoker often hangs around this area, using his familiarity with the environment to navigate alleys and streets. [Li Tianran] relentlessly pursued him to the front of a bookstore, where the smoker was injecting himself with drugs.
0:35:50|0:36:14|[Li Tianran] peeked through the door curtain of the bookstore, feeling triumphant. Behind the curtain, [Guan Qiaohong] leaned on a cane and swayed as she walked through the alley and left. After [Li Tianran] who had just been injected stood up, he was now in an excited state, feeling refreshed. [Li Tianran] walked briskly into the alley ahead, heading towards the tailor shop at the end of the alley. He saw a motorcycle parked in front of the tailor shop.
0:36:14|0:36:26|Approaching, he found a figure in a windbreaker squatting to repair a motorcycle. [Li Tianran] walked up and twisted the throttle, pretending to be cleverly asking:
0:39:54|0:40:3|A silver dollar flies in, [Li Tianran] holds a teacup and listens to the sound to determine the location, catches it in mid-air, and takes a closer look.
0:41:29|0:41:42|Li Tianran remembered the secret code the commander gave him before leaving, then disappeared on the rooftop, only to return again.
0:41:46|0:42:7|On the eaves, [Li Tianran] moves swiftly, leaping into the air and taking several steps before landing on the rafters. He identifies the direction, then moves like a monkey, climbing up and down. Sometimes he runs like a gazelle on the narrow rafters, which seem to be his playground. [Li Tianran] alternates between quick steps, somersaults, and jumps.
0:42:7|0:42:12|His clean and neat movements are full of beauty, effortlessly scaling walls and roofs.
0:42:12|0:42:24|After crossing a roof eave, [Li Tianran] frowned and walked slowly forward. Through the gap in the trees, [Li Tianran] saw a small flag in the yard not far away, with four big characters reflected on it saying "Genben Ichiro's Book House".
0:42:24|0:42:31|In the courtyard, young people are playing around, with [Li Tianran] lying on the eaves, carefully observing the situation in the courtyard.
0:42:31|0:42:39|The sound of pages flipping is heard as [Li Tianran] slides down from the roof and vaults over to the other side.
0:43:25|0:43:33|[Li Tianran] tiptoed through the corridor, seeing that no one noticed him.
0:43:58|0:44:3|Returning home, [Li Tianran] entered the inner room and leaped to hide the samurai sword in the ceiling beam. Next,
0:44:3|0:44:8|He lay on the bed, took out a seal, sighed, and stamped it on his hand. The scene shifted.
0:44:8|0:44:15|[Li Tianran] was playing with a seal, but when he ran into his father's room, he found it empty. He noticed the fabric on the sofa and was extremely delighted.
0:46:2|0:46:8|Tang Fengyi sensually lay on the bed, revealing her hot figure, and injected the medication for Li Tianran, suddenly,
0:47:2|0:47:5|[Tang Fengyi] gasped as she crossed the living room and answered the phone.
0:48:42|0:48:56|On the other side, Genben Ichiro met Lan Qingfeng at dusk on the city wall. After confirming their identities by shouting to each other from a distance, they both walked slowly up the city wall.
0:49:47|0:49:57|As the sky darkens, [Lan Qingfeng] quickly walks down the city wall. Not far away, a neatly dressed yellow carriage driver is waiting. [Lan Qingfeng] hurries onto the carriage.
0:50:8|0:50:34|That day, [Li Tianran] wore shorts and rode his bicycle onto the archway. The pedals of the bicycle were obviously modified differently from regular bicycles. [Li Tianran] rode the bike freely on the rooftop, like an acrobat, sometimes falling from high rooftops and sometimes climbing up from low eaves. His shadow under the sunlight reflected on the well-arranged rooftops, giving a unique taste of summer.
0:50:35|0:50:46|The bicycle slowly enters the tailor shop on the second floor where [Guan Qiaohong] is standing with tea in hand, watching as [Li Tianran] rides the bicycle in before coming downstairs.
0:52:9|0:52:28|In the blink of an eye, it was the day to bid farewell to Doctor Hendler. A luxury car drove into the embassy district in the eastern suburbs, and the soldiers at the gate quickly let it through when they saw the license plate. The embassy district was filled with heavy European-style buildings, and three luxury cars approached from different directions, each driving into the Six Nations Hotel one after another.
0:54:47|0:55:4|Doctor Hendler leaned on the table, staring intensely at [Zhu Qianlong], the atmosphere suddenly dropped to freezing point. The people in front of the table had different expressions, [Zhu Qianlong] stared fiercely at Doctor Hendler, [Lan Qingfeng] lowered his head and smoked a cigar, [Tang Fengyi] didn't look elsewhere, [Genben Ichiro] watched the two, waiting to see how it would end.
0:55:18|0:55:26|[Zhu Qianlong] slapped [Tang Fengyi] hard across the face.
0:56:15|0:56:21|Tang Fengyi sat down, while Zhu Qianlong rubbed his own cheeks.
0:56:48|0:56:55|The doctor [Doctor Hendler], who was pretending to be crazy, jumped onto a chair and took off his pants.
0:57:12|0:57:18|Li Tianran, dressed as a bartender, reluctantly picked up the ice bucket and walked out.
0:57:52|0:58:10|In front of the table, [Zhu Qianlong] vigorously shakes the champagne, while in the distance, a thin piece of ice is held between the fingertips, aiming towards the dining table. At the moment the champagne is opened, the ice in the hands of [Li Tianran] swiftly shoots out, and in an instant, the thin ice slices through [Zhu Qianlong]'s eyelid.
1:0:18|1:0:24|Doctor Hendler was pushed off the city wall by Lan Qingfeng.
1:3:36|1:3:47|Daughter [Lan Lan] came out to put a hood on [Li Tianran]. After driving for who knows how long, when his hood was removed, he found himself sitting on the clock tower.
1:4:9|1:4:25|[Lan Qingfeng] attracted a pigeon to land in his hand, [Lan Qingfeng] held the pigeon.
1:5:22|1:5:46|As the car stops in front of the Lan's house, several secret agents rush out from the door. [Lan Qingfeng] and his daughter get out of the car. The agents hang the police signboard at the Lan's house. Lan's daughter quickly walks towards the house. [Zhu Qianlong] dismisses his subordinates, who then run into the house.
1:7:35|1:8:3|At the entrance of the tailor shop, [Guan Qiaohong] vigorously pedals her bicycle in place. In the cool night, [Li Tianran] approaches. He swiftly arrives in front of [Guan Qiaohong], who stops her bicycle and looks up at [Li Tianran].
1:8:28|1:8:38|[Li Tianran] brought his tear-streaked face close to [Guan Qiaohong],
1:9:44|1:9:54|[Li Tianran] walked away on the high beam, while [Guan Qiaohong] stood on the roof watching [Li Tianran] disappear into the distance. [Guan Qiaohong] realized that it was Mr. Lan who prevented [Li Tianran] from returning home.
1:9:54|1:10:9|Early in the morning, [Guan Qiaohong] arrived at the Lan family's house with clothes she had made for [Li Tianran]. She saw a police station sign hanging on the gate of the Lan family. At the same time, [Li Tianran] crossed the archway and arrived at the tailor's shop, where he found that the wooden support for [Guan Qiaohong]'s bicycle had been broken.
1:11:59|1:12:11|Tang Fengyi's face turned pale, Li Tianran got up from the bed, while on the other side Guan Qiaohong returned to the tailor shop.
1:13:54|1:14:7|[Li Tianran] let out a cry, shook off the water on his face and walked out of the shower. He gently picked up a women's nightgown. When [Tang Fengyi] returned, the bathroom was empty, with only the curtains swaying in the wind.
1:14:15|1:14:31|[Li Tianran] dashed down from the archway in his pajamas, his bare bottom exposed. With agile movements, he leaped and jumped over several houses with just a few swift steps, his graceful figure gliding over the eaves. He swiftly made his way towards [Guan Qiaohong]'s tailor shop.
1:14:31|1:14:39|As he approached, Li Tianran looked around and noticed that Guan Qiaohong was not upstairs. He then walked towards the inner room, where the two of them coincidentally met in the hallway.
1:15:1|1:15:15|[Li Tianran] pulled on the dried shorts and [Guan Qiaohong] started pedaling hard on the bicycle for rehabilitation training. As the sky darkened, [Guan Qiaohong] climbed up the archway to the agreed place, where the evening breeze gently brushed her beautiful skirt.
1:15:33|1:16:3|[Li Tianran] took a few steps forward and arrived at one end of the roof. He first climbed up to the beam by holding onto a pillar, then briskly walked to the other end with small quick steps. He effortlessly leaped down while holding onto another pillar. At the other end of the archway, [Guan Qiaohong] slowly ascended by holding onto a pillar. The evening breeze gently lifted the hem of her skirt as she opened her arms and moved slowly to the middle of the archway. Then she crossed over the eaves, climbed up to the middle beam, still with her arms outstretched, walking slowly.
1:16:3|1:16:19|On a cool night, with the breeze blowing her dark hair, [Guan Qiaohong] slowly moved to the edge of the rooftop, leaning against a pillar. [Li Tianran] stood below with open arms to welcome her. [Guan Qiaohong] slowly made her way over and grabbed onto the pillar.
1:17:0|1:17:28|[Li Tianran] lifts the big clock, [Guan Qiaohong] lifts her skirt and goes in, [Li Tianran] follows. [Li Tianran] steps on the mechanism, and a hemp rope slowly descends from the top. [Guan Qiaohong] grabs the hemp rope, [Li Tianran] jumps and pulls on the rope, using a pulley to pull [Guan Qiaohong] up. Then he slowly climbs up the hemp rope, opens the top, and both of them stick their heads out.
1:17:28|1:17:35|[Li Tianran] was the first to emerge, then he helped [Guan Qiaohong] down from the bell tower to the platform.
1:17:59|1:18:10|At the sound of a gunshot, [Li Tianran] raised his hands and turned around to see [Guan Qiaohong] pointing a silenced pistol at himself.
1:19:24|1:19:40|[Li Tianran] turned around and found that [Guan Qiaohong] had dropped the gun and was already walking away from the top of the clock tower. At the Lan's house, [Lan Qingfeng] was reading the newspaper when a stone hit the newspaper.
1:20:21|1:20:39|[Li Tianran] supported the spy, [Lan Qingfeng] took out his phone, and the three of them posed for a photo. He wrapped it in a tablecloth, packed it up, and slung it over [Li Tianran].
1:20:50|1:20:56|In the early morning, [Guan Qiaohong] is pedaling a bicycle in the tailor shop, while [Li Tianran] walks towards the archway with a package on his back.
1:21:41|1:21:58|After seeing the photo, [Zhu Qianlong] quickly hid away. The setting sun cast its rays on the drum tower, [Li Tianran] sat in front of the tower eating the beef from the package. Hearing someone clapping, [Li Tianran] walked over, it was [Guan Qiaohong], descending slowly from the top.
1:22:52|1:23:18|After climbing down from the clock tower, Li Tianran arrived at the opium warehouse. He flexed his muscles and walked forward. With a running start, he pressed the spy's head into a bowl, knocking out the spy on the left with a headbutt, and kicking down the spy on the right. The commotion caught the attention of the Japanese. Li Tianran turned around, his eyes sharp. Calmly, he used chopsticks to pick up the noodles on the table, counting the number of enemies.
1:23:19|1:23:41|[Li Tianran] flicked the chopsticks into the bodies of the two men, took a quick step forward, and stabbed one of them fiercely with the chopsticks. He dodged the man's attack with a quick turn, moved behind him, and stabbed him hard in the lower back. The third man had his arm broken by him, followed by a kick to the knee. The last one was already scared by him.
1:23:41|1:23:47|[Li Tianran] subdued one with a shoulder throw, then turned around to deliver a knee strike to the third before calling it a day.
1:23:47|1:24:8|[Li Tianran] rushed to the opium warehouse with a samurai sword in hand. He lifted the lid to inspect, then cut off the chandelier with his sword. He ignited the opium by connecting the neutral and live wires and creating sparks.
1:24:11|1:24:27|In the distance, the opium warehouse in the woods was billowing with thick smoke. [Li Tianran], looking disheveled, crossed over the roof. His hair was messy, his clothes were in disarray, and his hands and face were blackened by soot, but he was feeling very pleased at this moment.
1:24:27|1:24:45|[Guan Qiaohong] looked at the distant fire on the drum tower, [Li Tianran] opened the cover of the big clock and emerged. He walked lightly to [Guan Qiaohong]'s side, and [Guan Qiaohong] gazed happily at the distant fire.
1:26:2|1:26:17|[Li Tianran] slowly approached and tackled [Guan Qiaohong]. The bright moon shone outside the building, with the distant opium warehouse emitting smoke and flickering firelight. A car drove into the Japanese military headquarters.
1:26:52|1:26:58|A big cannon was pushed to Lugou Bridge by the Japanese army.
1:27:2|1:27:7|This is the Marco Polo Bridge Incident. [Genben Ichiro] goes to the police station to find [Lan Qingfeng].
1:27:23|1:27:40|[Lan Qingfeng] put away the envelope, and the two of them sat down at a French restaurant. After opening the envelope and confirming with [Genben Ichiro], it was classified documents with only one name on the list: "[Zhu Qianlong]".
1:27:43|1:27:50|[Lan Qingfeng] stared at [Genben Ichiro] for a while, feeling like he was being played, and couldn't help but chuckle.
1:27:51|1:27:58|[Genben Ichiro] smiled as he watched [Lan Qingfeng], who kept flipping through the list to confirm that there was only one name.
1:28:11|1:28:19|Lan Qingfeng gritted his teeth and praised the Japanese for being powerful, as the shop owner brought over a teapot.
1:29:33|1:29:47|Lan Qingfeng, watch closely. Just as the yellow carriage pulled away, Genben Ichiro gave the order, and the Japanese spy shot the carriage driver. Three Japanese spies then approached Genben Ichiro to report the completion of the mission. Genben Ichiro waved his hand to dismiss the spies.
1:30:12|1:30:22|Several people lifted the deceased onto the yellow carriage and drove away, while [Genben Ichiro] laughed wildly.
1:30:29|1:30:35|Guan Qiaohong looked at the distant billowing flames from the drum tower.
1:32:50|1:32:55|[Guan Qiaohong] held a cup of tea, pursed her lips, gazing into the distance, lost in memories. Tears glistened faintly in [Guan Qiaohong]'s eyes.
1:33:35|1:33:41|In the early morning at the tailor shop, [Guan Qiaohong] was drawing water from the well while asking [Li Tianran].
1:35:58|1:36:11|[Li Tianran] looked like a child who had been wronged, shouting to leave, but [Guan Qiaohong] did not say a word to stop him. [Guan Qiaohong] stood on the roof, watching [Li Tianran] walking away from the archway in the distance. The dignified young man ran away without looking back.
1:36:12|1:36:20|[Guan Qiaohong] couldn't help but wonder in her heart, can he seek revenge? Can I? [Guan Qiaohong] thought to herself, while at this moment,
1:36:20|1:36:30|Lan Qingfeng, trapped in the wall, knocks on it. The sound of knocking reaches Zhu Qianlong and Genben Ichiro clearly.
1:38:1|1:38:9|[Lan Qingfeng] loaded the pistol, walked quickly towards the car, [Xi Jie] came to see him off, handing bullets to [Lan Qingfeng].
1:38:19|1:38:32|The car drove away from the Lan family, and at this moment, in Tang Fengyi's home, Zhu Qianlong, who was about to leave, suddenly stopped and walked around.
1:38:39|1:39:9|On the drum tower, a carrier pigeon flies in. [Li Tianran] takes down the carrier pigeon and becomes excited when he touches the letter on its leg. Meanwhile, [Lan Qingfeng] drives on the road, while [Tang Fengyi] at home contemplates how to save [Li Tianran]. [Li Tianran] opens the letter, excitedly sends off the carrier pigeon, and goes to the tailor shop. [Guan Qiaohong] drinks tea, reads the newspaper, and hears the sound of a car approaching. She gets up to greet the visitor, who turns out to be [Tang Fengyi] coming to deliver a message.
1:39:52|1:40:0|[Tang Fengyi] drove away after speaking, leaving [Guan Qiaohong] to ponder whether what [Tang Fengyi] said was trustworthy.
1:40:0|1:40:22|Meanwhile, [Lan Qingfeng] is driving towards the bell tower. Inside the bell tower, [Li Tianran] is holding a pocket watch, counting down to the departure time. In the car, [Lan Qingfeng] knows time is running out and has to speed up. [Li Tianran] places the pocket watch on the big clock and watches closely. The car stops under the drum tower, [Li Tianran] runs over and quickly jumps into the car, which then speeds away.
1:43:48|1:43:58|Li Tianran jumped onto the motorcycle from the tailor shop, tears streaming down Lan Qingfeng's face as he watched the motorcycle gradually disappear, carrying all his hopes.
1:43:58|1:44:7|At this moment, Zhu Qianlong's car also arrived.
1:44:29|1:44:41|Two men stood facing each other with guns across the car window, while the coachman and the secret agent began fighting on the bridge. Bullets hit the car's windshield, and the secret agent, with the advantage in numbers, overwhelmed the coachman. The sound of gunfire in the fierce battle was incessant.
1:44:44|1:45:13|Passengers on the bridge also joined the fight, while more police rushed to support. The two men in the car still confronted each other with guns. On the other side, a spy approached to give the driver a gun, but the driver pulled out a grenade. The grenade was thrown into [Zhu Qianlong]'s car, and [Zhu Qianlong] hurriedly threw it into [Lan Qingfeng]'s car. However, it was thrown back several times. The two men then crawled out of the windows on both sides and jumped off the bridge.
1:45:13|1:45:22|The car engine blown away fell into the water, while on the other side, a motorcycle was approaching.
1:45:28|1:45:44|At the same time, a car crashed through the back door of [Lan Qingfeng]'s house. [Zhu Qianlong]'s men grabbed [Lan Qingfeng]'s legs and dragged him on the ground. Seeing this, he immediately performed an aerial spin kick to knock down [Zhu Qianlong].
1:45:58|1:46:7|Meanwhile, Guan Qiaohong drove a motorcycle, carrying Li Tianran to Genben Ichiro's house, and the motorcycle turned and stopped.
1:46:23|1:46:43|[Guan Qiaohong] failed to get information from the old woman, so she used a needle to write a message on the window. The message on the window was [Guan Qiaohong] delivering a challenge on behalf of [Li Tianran]. Then she took out a newspaper and pointed to the words on it.
1:47:37|1:48:10|Two of them walked through the corridor into the inner room, seeing Lao Pan standing downstairs. [Li Tianran] went downstairs, and suddenly a figure flashed by, knocking [Li Tianran] unconscious with a stick. The secret agent picked him up, [Li Tianran] suddenly opened his eyes and kicked down the two men. Another secret agent came out and grabbed [Li Tianran]'s arm, delivering a series of kicks. Seeing two secret agents closing in from both sides, [Li Tianran] maneuvered and seized the opportunity to slam one down with a bear hug, while the other...
1:48:10|1:48:29|Li Tianran was knocked out by his high kick, and a special agent appeared behind him. Upstairs, Guan Qiaohong pulled out her gun and accurately shot down the enemy. Just then, Lao Pan fell down. Guan Qiaohong quickly went downstairs to check the situation, only to find that Lao Pan was already dead, with two bayonets stabbed in his back.
1:48:29|1:48:35|His body didn't collapse, which fooled the two of them. [Li Tianran] pulled out the dagger stuck in his back and threw it on the ground.
1:48:44|1:48:54|[Guan Qiaohong] with red eyes and trembling lips, handed the samurai sword to [Li Tianran].
1:48:56|1:49:5|[Li Tianran] took the samurai sword and ran out the door, leaving [Guan Qiaohong] in tears.
1:49:5|1:49:28|Meanwhile, [Lan Qingfeng] was being beaten up in the living room. Upon receiving the news, [Genben Ichiro] hurriedly left the house, drove to the Sun Altar, followed by a military police truck. The two cars drove out of the city gates, heading towards the outskirts for a duel. He was determined to win.
1:49:28|1:49:49|At dusk, at Lan Qingfeng's home, Lan Qingfeng did not compromise and was still hanging upside down in the air. Outside the city, Li Tianran stood in the center of the Sun Altar, holding Genben Ichiro's samurai sword. A cool breeze blew in as the sky darkened. Genben Ichiro's car slowly drove into the Sun Altar, where Li Tianran had been waiting for a long time.
1:50:25|1:50:32|[Li Tianran] threw the samurai sword, which was caught by [Genben Ichiro]. After a moment of scrutiny, [Genben Ichiro] mocked [Li Tianran]'s arrogance, intending to make him die a quick death.
1:50:34|1:50:49|The two kept moving to adjust their positions, with [Genben Ichiro] shouting out, "First strike!" [Li Tianran] also gestured with his fingers to help him count. [Genben Ichiro] tightly gripped the scabbard with one hand and placed the other on the hilt, his eyes fixed firmly on the target as he slowly adjusted his pace and breathing.
1:50:49|1:51:20|[Li Tianran] watched alertly as [Genben Ichiro] continuously adjusted his grip on the knife. With a swift strike, [Li Tianran] dodged to the side as [Genben Ichiro] sheathed his blade. A truck stopped outside the Sun Altar, and [Li Tianran] gestured for a second strike. [Genben Ichiro] looked serious, adjusting his stance constantly as they closed in on each other. Drawing his sword, [Genben Ichiro] made a move.
1:51:21|1:51:26|[Li Tianran] twisted his waist to dodge the fast and fierce attack, infuriating [Genben Ichiro] who shouted for a third strike.
1:51:32|1:51:55|[Li Tianran] was constantly jumping around like Bruce Lee, while [Genben Ichiro] held the knife in front of him, staring at [Li Tianran] to find an opportunity. Suddenly, [Genben Ichiro] rushed forward, missing with three consecutive slashes, but finally landed a blow with a downward chop, injuring [Li Tianran]'s left arm. [Genben Ichiro] then raised the long knife and struck down from above.
1:51:55|1:52:6|The strike was powerful and forceful, [Li Tianran] had to cross his hands to block the blade, using it to break [Genben Ichiro]'s ankle. [Genben Ichiro] kept retreating, while [Li Tianran] pursued and defeated him with three punches and two kicks.
1:52:14|1:52:20|After a burst of gunfire, the entire army on the truck was wiped out, with [Li Tianran] sneering, "I am more cunning than you."
1:52:21|1:52:27|[Li Tianran] drove to the door and found that it was [Guan Qiaohong] who helped him kill the military police.
1:52:29|1:52:36|[Li Tianran] wasted no time and drove away. [Guan Qiaohong] said to her subordinates. The car arrived at [Genben Ichiro]'s doorstep.
1:52:38|1:52:42|[Li Tianran] carried [Genben Ichiro] closer,
1:53:16|1:53:41|[Zhu Qianlong] called [Genben Ichiro]'s home, while [Li Tianran] sat in front of the phone eating noodles without any reaction. [Zhu Qianlong] hung up and personally extracted a tooth for [Lan Qingfeng]. He then dialed [Genben Ichiro]'s home again, but this time [Li Tianran] answered.
1:54:1|1:54:6|[Zhu Qianlong] drove to [Genben Ichiro]'s house, he pushed the door and walked quickly calling out for [Genben Ichiro] in the courtyard.
1:54:12|1:54:26|The Imperial Army is approaching, [Zhu Qianlong] walks quickly and becomes alert when he sees the bloodied face of [Genben Ichiro]. [Li Tianran] enters through the door, causing [Zhu Qianlong] to nervously step back, his hand reaching for his waist.
1:55:46|1:55:55|[Zhu Qianlong] gestured with his hand as if holding a gun, but [Li Tianran] pulled out a revolver and pointed it at [Zhu Qianlong].
1:56:24|1:56:40|Both of them leaped up simultaneously, throwing a punch in the air before landing. They stood still and jumped up again, exchanging a kick in mid-air. After landing once more, they assumed their stances. Facing each other, they dodged each other's moves with precision, knowing each other's techniques like the back of their hands.
1:56:48|1:56:58|The two circled around [Genben Ichiro]'s chair, groaning [Genben Ichiro] was knocked unconscious by a punch from [Li Tianran]. The two martial brothers exchanged blows like the wind, countering each other's moves for dozens of rounds.
1:56:58|1:57:20|The situation became even more intense as both Li Tianran and Zhu Qianlong grabbed each other's collars without prior agreement. Genben Ichiro stood up and shouted, only to be kicked unconscious by Li Tianran. The two pushed each other away and locked legs until they each landed a kick, finally separating.
1:57:29|1:57:53|The two started to move their muscles again, [Li Tianran] reached out to provoke, then ran towards the house. [Zhu Qianlong] chased directly, just as [Li Tianran] had run a few steps in the corridor, [Zhu Qianlong] crashed through the window and pounced in, blocking the way. [Zhu Qianlong] flipped over, his face covered with broken glass. The senior brother made another leap but was opened by the junior brother. The junior brother threw the glass, which stuck in the senior brother's buttocks.
1:57:55|1:58:1|Junior Brother jumped out of the window and started punching and kicking the senior brother who was fleeing with his head in his arms, displaying a thug-like demeanor.
1:58:1|1:58:12|Senior Brother also unwilling to show weakness, kicked him in the crotch, causing Junior Brother to retreat and fall down on the spot. Senior Brother then delivered a series of headbutts to his forehead. The two then stood up again, exchanging punches without dodging each other.
1:58:55|1:59:21|Another round of punches landed on Li Tianran's face, grabbing his fingers and using all his strength to swing him around. Li Tianran jumped up, kicking Zhu Qianlong's chest hard. Zhu Qianlong could only grab and throw Li Tianran away, then ran to the corridor. Li Tianran quickly got up and chased after him. Zhu Qianlong escaped to the window, climbed onto the roof, and ran frantically. Unexpectedly, Li Tianran intercepted him from the other side.
1:59:27|1:59:51|Senior Brother turned around and ran back, but was hugged by Junior Brother and rolled onto the eaves. The two of them fought and kicked each other away again. They both got up with the help of the tiles, poised for a fight, and then slowly moved forward. Both reached out their hands to signal, both with sinister intentions, and simultaneously used headbutts to strike each other's heads.
1:59:51|2:0:1|Junior Brother couldn't bear a bear hug, and the two fell on the tiles like this. Seizing the opportunity, Senior Brother locked his throat from behind.
2:0:23|2:0:40|The junior brother half-knelt and tried hard to pull the senior brother's leg. In the struggle, the two of them reached the edge of the roof. The junior brother kicked the roof, and they both fell down at the same time, with dust falling from the roof onto them.
2:0:40|2:0:52|In the courtyard, [Li Tianran] was nowhere to be seen. The senior brother lying on the ground briefly lost consciousness. At that moment, [Genben Ichiro] rushed out of the house with a knife and lunged towards [Li Tianran].
2:1:0|2:1:13|The crazy [Genben Ichiro] muttered to himself, then rushed forward with a knife in hand, stabbing his senior brother in the chest.
2:1:32|2:1:38|He killed [Genben Ichiro] with one stroke of the knife.
2:1:40|2:1:48|The junior brother pulled the senior brother lying on the ground, pointed a gun at his forehead, and pulled the trigger.
2:2:36|2:2:39|The senior brother cried, but the junior brother smiled and let go.
2:2:52|2:3:28|The bullet passed through the head of Senior Brother, a drop of blood dripped onto the name of [Li Tianran] forming four dots. Junior Brother wiped away the remaining three dots with his hand as the car drove back to the back door of the Lan family. The teeth of [Lan Qingfeng] were pulled out, and as [Li Tianran] walked to the door, he picked up the teeth. [Li Tianran] approached slowly, causing the secret agents to immediately stop their actions and stare at him. Suddenly, a secret agent threw an axe, but [Li Tianran] dodged it and shot the tooth into the eyeball.
2:3:28|2:3:37|Another secret agent stepped forward, [Li Tianran] with his fists and punches, his moves swift and powerful, either throwing or neck-breaking, leaving the other agents helpless in his wake.
2:3:37|2:3:43|[Li Tianran] pulled out a gun, loaded it, and released the safety.
2:4:12|2:4:36|[Lan Qingfeng] signaled with a code, [Li Tianran] wiped his forehead with tears in his eyes, then drove the car with [Lan Qingfeng] out of the back door of the Lan family, leaving in a cloud of dust.
2:4:37|2:4:55|From dusk until nightfall, the car slowly came to a stop. [Li Tianran] got out and ran into a house. Shortly after, General Zhang emerged from the house. [Li Tianran] approached and opened the car door for him. General Zhang got into the car, which then drove past the dazzling streetlights.
2:4:55|2:5:1|At this moment, there were three people in the car, with [Lan Qingfeng] lying in the back seat, his face covered in blood.
2:5:7|2:5:21|The car slowly drove towards the Embassy District on Dongjiaomin Lane, passed the sentries, and slowly stopped in front of a beautiful building. General Zhang and [Li Tianran] looked at the door of the building as if waiting for something.
2:5:23|2:5:45|The exquisite gate remained silent for a long time. The two of them waited nervously. Suddenly, the door opened and a foreign couple walked out. The lady patted Li Tianran's face and gave him a tip, which Li Tianran casually threw onto the back seat of the car.
2:5:45|2:5:53|General Zhang saluted the two before entering the door, and they returned the salute. The car promptly left the embassy area. Unexpectedly, Li Tianran...
2:5:53|2:6:3|Li Tianran was stopped by the Japanese. As they approached to inspect, Li Tianran reached for his gun.
2:6:15|2:6:24|But before he could escape the shooting, the Japanese pointed a gun at [Li Tianran], questioning why he was still wearing Japanese clothes.
2:6:36|2:6:50|He called his companions to see the Chinese donkey, and [Li Tianran] broke his neck. One of the companions rushed over with a dagger, but was knocked down by [Li Tianran] with a punch.
2:6:50|2:6:57|Li Tianran picked up the gun stock and smashed it down hard, the car started again and disappeared into the night.
2:6:58|2:7:15|In the early morning, the Japanese troops marched towards the gates of Beiping. Japanese women on the city walls waved flags and cheered, while journalists below crowded around to take photos. Amidst the enthusiastic cheers, the Japanese troops entered the city through Chaoyang Gate.
2:7:47|2:7:54|[Li Tianran] frowned and asked [Doctor Hendler] to cure him.
2:7:54|2:8:4|After Li Tianran finished speaking, he shoveled the coal balls to make the fire burn brightly.
2:8:4|2:8:19|In the puzzled eyes of the fat man, [Li Tianran] ran back to the car, angrily carrying the Japanese man who was killed last night, and then walked to the stove and threw him in.
2:8:20|2:8:57|[Li Tianran] patted the fat man, turned and walked away quickly. The fat man scooped up the coal ball, the fire became more vigorous, black smoke billowed from the chimney. [Tang Fengyi], in pajamas on the city wall, walked over slowly. He passed through the cheering Japanese women, while Japanese soldiers climbed up the stone lions below the city wall. [Tang Fengyi] stood at the high point of the city wall. [Li Tianran] crawled out of the window and saw the tailor shop engulfed in flames, stunned.
2:8:57|2:9:23|Under the city wall, a Japanese soldier asked the journalist to take a photo of him. [Tang Fengyi] jumped down from the wall and hit him. On the archway, [Li Tianran] ran towards the tailor's shop. The present [Li Tianran] has avenged his great hatred, and he feels extremely relaxed and content without the burden of hatred. This trip to Beiping has been fulfilled in his heart.
2:9:23|2:9:29|He ran briskly as if flying, the green plants adorned archways, not hindering his speed at all.
2:9:29|2:9:40|He only wanted to rush to the tailor's shop in his heart, Li Tianran, who came running from the archway, panting, looked at Guan Qiaohong.
2:11:56|2:12:3|[Li Tianran] had tears in his eyes, [Guan Qiaohong] turned around with tears streaming down her face, [Guan Qiaohong] shook her head.
