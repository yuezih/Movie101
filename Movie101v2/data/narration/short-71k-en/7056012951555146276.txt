0:0:22|0:0:39|The story begins in a luxurious mansion, where the overweight host Wang Bo is sitting on a single sofa studying English, the beautiful female tutor Wang Li is sitting opposite him teaching, and the imposing mansion hostess is coming downstairs holding a medicine bottle.
0:2:2|0:2:6|The male protagonist bent over to wave goodbye to his wife.
0:2:6|0:2:11|The female nanny [Lan Lan] ran over in an apron, and the male master called her aside.
0:2:29|0:2:40|[Lan Lan] ran away cheerfully, and the male host turned to look at the female tutor [Wang Li] with lust in his eyes.
0:3:0|0:3:8|The male protagonist pushes [Wang Li] into the bedroom and presses her on the bed. [Wang Li] resists at first but then playfully wrestles with him on the bed.
0:3:8|0:3:14|The bedroom door was wide open, and not far away in the bathroom, a camera clearly captured everything happening in the bedroom.
0:3:14|0:3:20|A man with extremely sharp hair sits in the bathtub, drinking whiskey while watching the footage on the camera.
0:3:20|0:3:26|He glanced out the window, then picked up the camera placed by the bathtub and walked into the bedroom with a smile.
0:3:26|0:3:29|The male protagonist is lying on top of [Wang Li], completely scared out of his wits.
0:4:10|0:4:18|The male protagonist, Wang Bo, lay on the bed unable to speak for half a day.
0:4:49|0:4:51|The three of them then arrived outdoors.
0:5:12|0:5:15|Mr. Liu lifts the towel that [Wang Li] had placed on his head.
0:5:24|0:5:29|Wang Li's companion stood up, patted his pants, and then sat back down next to Mr. Liu.
0:5:39|0:5:42|[Wang Li] glanced outside.
0:6:10|0:6:13|[Wang Li] gave Mr. Liu a slap and then walked away.
0:6:13|0:6:16|Mr. Liu was stunned, his glasses even slipped down below his nose.
0:6:31|0:6:35|Wang Li's companion, Wang Bo, touched Mr. Liu's face tenderly.
0:6:35|0:6:38|Mr. Liu remained silent, his face full of fat hanging with grievances.
0:6:38|0:6:45|After a while, a BMW drove out of the mansion, and the security guard standing next to the big iron gate saluted in the direction of the car.
0:6:45|0:6:56|The BMW drove out for a while, then reversed back to the security guard. The driver's side window slowly rolled down, and [Wang Bo] smiled as he leaned out, resting his left arm on the window frame before speaking.
0:7:6|0:7:10|The security guard was a bit at a loss, and [Wang Bo] reached out and patted the car door.
0:7:26|0:7:29|Wang Bo noticed that Wang Li didn't look well, muttered a few words, and then left.
0:7:29|0:7:33|The security guard greeted with a puzzled expression.
0:7:33|0:7:36|On the road, [Wang Bo] reached out and patted [Wang Li] while driving.
0:7:40|0:7:47|[Wang Li] maintained her gaze out the car window, shook her head, and then lowered it to pull out a CD and put it into the car's drive.
0:7:47|0:7:52|The melodious music plays, [Wang Bo] doesn't speak anymore, just smiles at [Wang Li].
0:7:52|0:7:56|The two of them, driving the luxury car extorted, set off on their journey.
0:7:56|0:8:4|They went to many places, deserted deserts, picturesque canyons, towering ice mountains, and endless grasslands.
0:8:4|0:8:9|[Wang Li] seems to have become somewhat silent. She often sits in the car lost in thought, sometimes staring blankly.
0:8:10|0:8:17|When [Wang Bo] notices that his partner is feeling unwell, he always covers her with a coat first, then hugs her from behind to comfort her.
0:8:17|0:8:22|[Wang Li] returned to the other person with a heart full of thoughts and kissed him without saying a word.
0:8:22|0:8:26|She seemed to be worried about something, but it seemed that she couldn't speak it out.
0:8:26|0:8:28|The story is about to unfold from here.
0:8:28|0:8:35|This film is a drama directed by Feng Xiaogang, starring Andy Lau, Liu Ruoying, Ge You, Wang Baoqiang, and [Wang Bo] and [Wang Li].
0:8:35|0:8:50|Based on the novel of the same name by Zhao Benfu, the film mainly tells the story of a pair of thief partners who, in order to fulfill the wish of a laborer named Shagen for a world without thieves, engage in a series of fierce battles with another group of thieves on a train.
0:8:51|0:8:56|Male thief [Wang Bo] and female thief [Wang Li] are a pair of climbing partners in theft, as well as a pair of fugitive lovers.

0:9:5|0:9:9|[Wang Li] discovers that she is pregnant and wants to break away from this stagnant life.
0:9:10|0:9:18|But out of shame for their identity as thieves, it made him doubt whether he and [Wang Bo] could be good parents, so he was feeling very conflicted.
0:9:18|0:9:22|While [Wang Bo] was puzzled by these unknown thoughts, the two of them had several conflicts on the way.
0:9:22|0:9:31|On the train back to the city, Wang Bo and Wang Li met a migrant worker named Sha Gen, who had earned a sum of money working in the west and wanted to return to his hometown to build a house and get married.
0:9:31|0:9:34|Shagen, not believing that there are thieves in the world, insisted on carrying money on the road.
0:9:34|0:9:44|[Wang Li], touched by Sha Gen's simplicity due to a brief encounter in the past, decides to protect Sha Gen and the money in his bag, fulfilling his dream of a world without thieves.
0:9:44|0:9:52|And on the car, there was another gang trying to steal Sha Gen's money. Therefore, [Wang Bo] and [Wang Li] engaged in a series of fierce battles with this gang.

0:10:11|0:10:21|The 5th Chinese Film Media Awards Best Actress and Centennial Media Tribute Film Award, premiered in mainland China on December 9, 2004.
0:10:22|0:10:24|Continuing to tell you about the main part of the film.
0:10:24|0:10:28|[Wang Bo] parked the car in a vast grassland and got out alone to wander around.
0:10:28|0:10:35|[Wang Li], wrapped in a coat and scarf, curled up in the back seat, unable to stop dry heaving, obviously suffering from severe morning sickness.
0:10:44|0:10:48|[Wang Li] slowly pushed herself away from the back of the seat as she spoke, lifting her head weakly.
0:10:49|0:11:9|He stared at [Wang Bo] without blinking, hoping to hear what he wanted from the other's mouth. However, [Wang Bo] just looked at him with a cigarette in his mouth, raised a lighter without saying a word, lit the cigarette in his mouth, took a deep drag, exhaled smoke while sighing.
0:11:13|0:11:21|Wang Bo was swearing non-stop, while Wang Li lifted her leg and kicked the driver's seat hard. She glared at Wang Bo, rolled her eyes, and then retreated to the corner.
0:11:21|0:11:29|She raised her right hand wearing a pair of leather gloves, adjusted the scarf wrapped around her head, then curled up her body in silence without speaking again.
0:11:29|0:11:32|[Wang Bo] was kicked by [Wang Li], causing him to tremble, and slowly withdrew his gaze.
0:11:32|0:11:51|Leaning against the driver's seat, Wang Bo took two deep puffs of his cigarette, then opened the car door and threw the remaining long stub of the cigarette onto the ground. He stretched his left leg out of the car, forcefully stomped on the ground with his foot clad in brand new leather shoes, then stepped on the gas pedal and sped off into the distance. The car gradually disappeared, leaving only the occasional flickering of the taillights in the distance.
0:11:51|0:11:58|The pitch-black dusk gradually turned into the face of a Buddha in front of everyone, giving rise to a sense of solemnity and reverence.
0:11:59|0:12:3|The title "A World Without Thieves" then appears in the center of the screen.
0:12:19|0:12:25|[Wang Bo] and [Wang Li] finally arrived at their destination, Tibet, after a long journey.
0:12:25|0:12:34|They parked the car on the road and suddenly saw a dazzling glow shining through the clouds, illuminating the buildings at the foot of the mountain, like a Buddha's light shining all over, which was amazing.
0:12:49|0:12:51|Wang Li's face is filled with seriousness.
0:12:56|0:12:59|[Wang Bo] sent him to the main street and then disappeared.
0:12:59|0:13:10|[Wang Li] came alone to the outside of a building, which was a temple still under renovation. The temple gate had not been installed yet, temporarily covered by a huge piece of cloth, with countless iron frames surrounding the sides of the gate.
0:13:10|0:13:19|The whole temple seems to have just been built, the windows have not been installed yet. There are ladders placed on the side of the temple, and workers are constantly carrying plastic buckets or other containers up.
0:13:19|0:13:31|[Wang Li] knelt devoutly outside the door, hands clasped together in front of his chest, eyes tightly closed, murmuring words silently. He bowed forward, then stood up, opened his eyes, and continued to kneel outside the temple, praying.
0:13:31|0:13:35|Occasionally, there were two or three pedestrians passing by behind, very desolate.
0:13:35|0:13:45|A young man wearing a winter hat is standing not far away to the right, wearing a watch and holding a basin of strange paint, painting patterns on the square wooden stake protruding from the eaves.
0:13:45|0:13:49|As he was painting, he happened to look down and saw [Wang Li] kneeling below.
0:13:50|0:13:58|Bowing and kowtowing to the Buddha repeatedly, he seemed to be drawn by the other party, not even noticing the paint dripping from the brush in his hand onto the ground.
0:13:58|0:14:7|Leaving [Wang Li], [Wang Bo] came alone to the bustling corridor of the temple, which was obviously a very popular attraction with many foreigners visiting here.
0:14:7|0:14:16|[Wang Bo] walked forward with a smile on his face, holding a camera in his right hand and looking at the screen. Suddenly, he reached into the pocket of his chest and took out a small piece of blade into his palm with his left hand.
0:14:16|0:14:34|As he walked, he casually opened the backpack of a man next to him. A leather wallet fell out from the bottom of the backpack. Huang Bo raised his hand and caught it skillfully. His smile grew bigger and bigger. The next second, he opened another person's bag and a palm-sized metal box fell out. Right before it hit the ground, he kicked it with force.
0:14:34|0:14:37|The box flew up in an instant and landed right in his hands.
0:14:37|0:14:42|[Wang Bo] shook the box and a little boy nearby stood there with his mouth wide open in amazement.
0:14:42|0:14:48|Outside the temple corridor, a young woman with disheveled hair and wearing a loose cloak, [Wang Li], arrived among the kneeling crowd.
0:14:48|0:14:56|He forcefully lifted his cloak, and in the moment of kneeling down, swiftly sliced open the nearby person's small bag, then instantly pulled out the other party's phone and placed it in his palm.
0:14:57|0:15:0|Every move of the young woman is seen by [Wang Bo].
0:15:0|0:15:4|She turned around, knelt down, knocked her head against the temple, and then stood up and walked away.
0:15:4|0:15:13|In a split second as he passed by the young woman, Wang Bo deftly stole back the phone she had stolen from someone else, and casually greeted her face to face.
0:15:13|0:15:16|[Wang Bo] then left the temple and sat in a corner to rest.
0:15:16|0:15:20|He opened the stolen iron box and gave the candies inside to a group of children.
0:15:20|0:15:23|After the prayer, [Wang Bo] and [Wang Li] set off on their journey once again.
0:15:23|0:15:27|[Wang Bo] whistled while driving, and couldn't help but laugh out loud.
0:15:27|0:15:31|He then raised a bag and threw it to [Wang Li], which was filled with cell phones.
0:16:3|0:16:9|Wang Li angrily pulled Wang Bo and reached out to grab the steering wheel as they argued.
0:16:9|0:16:27|The small car, which was originally driving straight, began to wobble on the road. Just as Wang Bo and Wang Li were struggling, a large truck with the Great Wall lubricant logo on its body came towards them. As the two vehicles were about to collide, the truck driver widened his eyes, turned the steering wheel sharply, and successfully swerved past them.
0:16:27|0:16:30|[Wang Bo] then rode the motorcycle and stopped by the roadside.
0:16:30|0:16:31|[Wang Bo] is full of anger.
0:16:36|0:16:43|He cursed while opening the car door and glanced at [Wang Li], whose eyes were slightly red. He stared at [Wang Bo] for a moment, then turned back and said.
0:16:51|0:17:9|[Wang Bo] looked a bit puzzled, his lips slightly parted as he turned to look at [Wang Li]. He saw tears welling up in her eyes as she stared at him without blinking. Feeling unsure, he remained silent, pursed his lips, swallowed, and after a moment of contemplation, nodded in agreement.
0:17:36|0:17:45|Facing Wang Bo's denial, Wang Li immediately raised her hand and forcefully pulled open her coat and the shirt underneath, revealing a round scar on the right side of her chest.
0:17:45|0:17:52|She glared fiercely at [Wang Bo] with a face full of grievances, but still stubbornly controlled herself from shedding tears.
0:17:52|0:18:3|[Wang Bo] was also a bit excited at this moment. He took two deep breaths, inhaling forcefully and exhaling with strength. However, tears still couldn't help but fall down. He forced a smile, wiped away the tears, and sneered.
0:18:23|0:18:29|[Wang Bo] chuckled, shaking his head as he pulled out a bank card from his pocket and tossed it into [Wang Li]'s handbag.
0:18:29|0:18:35|He put away the bank card, opened the door and got out of the car without hesitation, walking forward with a scarf wrapped around his neck, not looking back.
0:18:35|0:18:42|He walked resolutely, [Wang Bo]'s car stayed in place for a long time, then slowly caught up with [Wang Li].
0:18:42|0:18:47|He controlled the steering wheel with one hand and turned his head to the right, trying to attract the other's attention.
0:18:47|0:18:50|The other party didn't even look at himself, and walked faster and faster.
0:18:50|0:18:54|[Wang Bo] had no choice but to lower his posture and apologize to show goodwill.
0:19:1|0:19:5|In the other side of the alley, a young man riding a bicycle suddenly asked, "..."
0:19:17|0:19:25|The young man evaded the old man's questions, suddenly lowered his head and smiled, then quickly suppressed the smile and left the alley with the old man.
0:19:25|0:19:33|On the road, [Wang Li] has already reached exhaustion, she weakly looks up at the sky, then continues to limp forward.
0:19:33|0:19:39|Seeing a motorcycle approaching, [Wang Li] hurriedly stepped forward to stop it, but the other party completely ignored her.
0:20:7|0:20:13|The young man who just asked about his age, and is planning to use money to build a house and marry a wife, is Wang Bo.
0:20:13|0:20:22|At this moment, [Wang Li] happened to be on the road. She saw a group of people riding bicycles passing by, so she hurried forward to seek help again, but still no one paid attention to her.
0:20:22|0:20:30|She stood on a small hill, took a few quick steps, saw Wang Bo turn around, hurriedly waved at her, but Wang Bo did not stop, and instead left with the uncles.
0:20:30|0:20:36|[Wang Li] was somewhat disappointed. She bent down slightly, gasping for breath wearily, then shouted and sat down on the ground.
0:20:38|0:20:46|Hearing someone shouting, Sha Gen, who had already left, kept turning back to look behind, and eventually chose to ride back to where Wang Li was.
0:20:46|0:20:55|And at this moment, [Wang Li] sat on the ground with a sense of loss, her hands weakly resting on her legs, a few strands of messy hair falling on her face, highlighting a hint of exhaustion.
0:20:55|0:21:4|Just as [Wang Li] was at a loss, she inadvertently looked up and saw the young man [Sha Gen], who should have left, unexpectedly appearing not far away, waving at her.
0:21:5|0:21:11|He followed [Sha Gen] to the bicycle, took Sha Gen's water bottle and wiped the can to his mouth without saying a word.
0:21:11|0:21:22|After finishing a pot of water, he wiped his mouth contentedly, looked up at [Wang Bo], and saw him smiling foolishly with his mouth covered, revealing his small white teeth. Then he laughed and pulled down the headscarf wrapped around his head.
0:21:22|0:21:25|Long embroidered hair cascaded down, [Wang Bo] shyly lowered his head.
0:21:50|0:21:55|Upon hearing [Sha Gen]'s words, [Wang Li] fell silent and sat on the back seat of [Sha Gen]'s bicycle, lost in thought.
0:21:55|0:21:59|After a long time, [Wang Bo] parked his bicycle by the roadside.
0:21:59|0:22:2|[Wang Li] got off the back seat and took out a banknote from her pocket to hand it to [Sha Gen].
0:22:2|0:22:9|[Fool] stood with his hands on the bicycle, looking at [Wang Li].
0:22:9|0:22:11|[Wang Li] directly hands the money to [Wang Bo].
0:22:13|0:22:20|Watching [Shagen] ride away on the bike, [Wang Li] turned around and prepared to leave. Just as she took a few steps, she heard some noise behind her.
0:22:20|0:22:24|She stopped and looked back, only to see [Wang Bo] riding his bike back again.
0:22:24|0:22:30|She parked the car in front of [Wang Li], got out and took a rope from her neck to hand it to the other person.
0:22:37|0:22:41|[Shagen] handed the chain to [Wang Li] and then rode away on his bike.
0:22:41|0:22:48|[Wang Li] looked at the back of [Sha Gen], then lowered her head to look at the chain in her hand, with a pendant of a demon-slaying staff hanging in the center of the chain.
0:22:48|0:22:53|Shortly after, [Wang Bo] arrived outside the courtyard wall, sat on the ground, and had a meal with everyone.
0:22:53|0:23:0|The previous accountant walked over with a cloth bag.
0:23:0|0:23:3|In the bundle is the money that [Wang Bo] plans to use to build a house and get married.
0:23:54|0:24:2|Shagen completely ignored the advice and came to a grassland alone at night, shouting as he walked forward.
0:24:16|0:24:17|Wang Bo suddenly appeared not far away.
0:24:42|0:24:44|After bidding farewell to [Lang Qun], [Shagen] left.
0:24:44|0:25:0|The next day, in the VIP room of the train station, an old man with a white beard sat with his eyes closed on the central sofa, while a man with glasses sat beside him skillfully playing with a coin. A fat man wearing a duckbill cap pushed the door and walked towards them.
0:25:31|0:25:38|The man with glasses glared angrily at the woman, who remained silent. She suddenly stood up and sat next to the old man with a white beard, who is [Uncle Li].
0:26:34|0:26:43|Saying that, [Uncle Li] forcefully swung his hand and directly threw the watch on his wrist onto Siyan's wrist.
0:26:43|0:26:55|Siyan was somewhat surprised. On the other side of the waiting room, a man in a leather jacket was drawing a portrait. Wang Bo walked through the crowd and handed him a glass of water.
0:27:10|0:27:12|[Wang Bo] had a look of concern on his face, while [Wang Li] remained silent.
0:27:15|0:27:19|The train is about to depart, [Wang Bo] supports [Wang Li] as they walk out of the rear carriage.
0:27:19|0:27:23|At the same time, [Wang Bo] and his group of four also walked out of the VIP room.
0:27:23|0:27:27|[Wang Bo] looked up and saw the woman Xiao Ye whom he had seen at the temple gate before.
0:27:27|0:27:30|Just as they exchanged greetings, they heard someone shouting loudly not far away.
0:27:38|0:27:39|The person shouting is Wang Bo.
0:27:43|0:27:48|As soon as the words fell, Uncle Li and [Wang Bo] [Wang Li] turned back to look at him together.
0:27:48|0:27:55|Ai, Shagen stood in the crowd shouting non-stop, and the people next to him began to walk onto the train one after another.
0:27:55|0:28:2|The colleagues who came to send Sha Gen were also speechless about his behavior, not knowing what to say, and [Wang Li] recognized him at this time.
0:28:42|0:28:46|[Wang Li] suddenly turned around and pointed at [Wang Bo]'s nose with the ticket in her hand.
0:28:46|0:28:54|[Wang Bo] quickly shook his head and climbed onto the train. The silly person who got on the train first saw an empty seat, hurriedly moved his luggage onto the table, and turned to call [Wang Li] and [Wang Bo].
0:29:21|0:29:29|Teacher Han, who was the leather-jacketed man that Wang Bo stole the wallet from in the back hall before, tried to sit down, but was directly rejected by Wang Bo.
0:29:32|0:29:40|Teacher Han had no choice but to sit on the other side of the aisle. Seeing the other person sit down, [Wang Bo] and [Wang Li] then stood up to take off their coats and scarves.
0:29:40|0:29:48|Just as [Wang Bo] stood up to put clothes on the luggage rack, Uncle Li walked over with a cane and stood behind [Wang Bo], speaking.
0:30:8|0:30:15|[Wang Bo] supported Uncle Li to the connection of the carriage, closed the door casually, crossed his hands and leaned against the wall, quietly watching Uncle Li perform.
0:30:45|0:30:51|[Wang Bo] snorted coldly, returned to the carriage alone, the train started officially, and everyone sat in their own seats.
0:31:30|0:31:44|[Wang Bo] looked at Sha Gen and helplessly patted his shoulder.
0:31:45|0:31:47|[Wang Bo] glanced at [Wang Li] with a twist of emotion.
0:31:53|0:31:55|[Wang Li] drinks water while glaring at [Wang Bo].
0:32:17|0:32:34|You look like a Bodhisattva to everyone, but it's useless. [Wang Bo] mocked Shagen while holding a cup, [Wang Li] couldn't bear to see the dumbfounded Shagen, turned her head and glared at [Wang Bo].
0:33:18|0:33:24|Looking at Sha Gen's naive appearance, [Wang Bo] didn't know what to say.
0:33:24|0:33:29|Sha Gen turned his head to ask [Wang Bo], but [Wang Bo] had his eyes closed, whether he was really asleep or pretending to be asleep.
0:33:29|0:33:32|The truck continued to move forward, and Wang Li returned to the luxurious sleeper compartment.
0:33:52|0:33:54|Uncle Li removes his makeup while answering Fatty.
0:34:37|0:34:40|The fat man on the sofa stood up directly and started fighting with Xiao Ye.
0:34:40|0:34:48|Xiaoye refused to back down and left several scratches on [Wang Bo]'s face.
0:34:48|0:34:50|Upon hearing Uncle Li's voice, Wang Bo and Wang Li had no choice but to stop.
0:34:50|0:34:56|Xiaoye's middle finger was almost cut off by [Wang Bo], he withdrew his left hand and was poked on the head by [Wang Bo] a few times.
0:35:14|0:35:27|Xiao Ye sat on the bed and combed her hair, then got up.
0:35:27|0:35:31|Seeing [Wang Bo] walk out, Xiao Ye rolled her eyes and walked to Uncle Li's side to help him massage his shoulders.
0:35:49|0:35:54|Wang Bo, who was originally sitting in the carriage, is now carrying his bag and going to the toilet alone.
0:35:54|0:35:57|He had just come out of the bathroom when he was splashed with boiling water by someone across from him.
0:36:2|0:36:5|Shagen was scalded and took a step back, bumping directly into [Fatty].
0:36:5|0:36:9|[Fatty] lured him in and then flung the bag that was originally hanging in front of him behind his back.
0:36:9|0:36:14|The bespectacled person who was about to open the bag of water was immediately grabbed by [Wang Bo] who followed closely.
0:36:14|0:36:18|He and [Siyan] locked eyes for a moment, then stood in place and started pushing and shoving each other.
0:36:18|0:36:22|[Wang Bo] blocked Siyan's attack while quietly putting his index finger to his lips.
0:36:24|0:36:39|Watching the humiliating smile on [Wang Bo]'s face, Siyan became angry. He flicked a blade from his sleeve and slid it towards [Wang Bo]'s hand. Without any hesitation, [Wang Bo] lightly twisted his wrist to dodge the attack. Siyan's assault became more fierce, and in the blink of an eye, [Wang Bo] also had a blade in his hand.
0:36:39|0:36:52|The fat guy next to him still controlled Sha Gen, and under the pretext of helping Sha Gen check his injuries, he handed the bag from Sha Gen's backpack to Si Yan. [Wang Bo] turned his head and saw [Wang Li] walking towards him, snatched the backpack and threw it over, then pushed Sha Gen over as well.
0:36:55|0:37:2|[Wang Bo] hung the bag back on Sha Gen's neck.
0:37:2|0:37:6|Seeing the police approaching, the fat man hugged [Wang Bo] and Four Eyes, pretending to be intimate.
0:37:6|0:37:18|As soon as the police left, [Wang Bo] immediately changed his expression.
0:37:18|0:37:21|The fat man pushed [Wang Bo] away, [Wang Bo] was stunned for a moment, then suddenly smiled.
0:37:29|0:37:34|Wang Bo chuckled foolishly and took out the money.
0:37:34|0:37:47|[Wang Bo] then took out a tube of ointment from his bag and applied some with his fingers.
0:37:47|0:37:50|Wang Li reached out and applied some ointment under [Sha Gen]'s neck.
0:37:56|0:37:59|[Shagen] obediently raised his head for [Wang Li] to help him apply the medicine.
0:37:59|0:38:7|[Wang Li] helped him apply some medicine on his neck and near his chin, then she tilted his head back and blew on the reddened skin.
0:38:7|0:38:12|[Wang Bo] sat across without saying a word, but smiled as he looked at [Wang Li], recalling the sweet memories of the past.
0:38:14|0:38:19|He remembered that before their argument, they had embraced and passionately kissed on the boat.
0:38:19|0:38:22|These memories are deeply imprinted in his mind.
0:38:41|0:38:42|[Wang Li] suddenly looked up.
0:38:46|0:38:55|Wang Li saw Wang Bo acting improperly and gave him a slap on the butt.
0:38:55|0:39:3|The city clerk started selling boxed meals. Across the aisle, Teacher Han heard the commotion and prepared to pay. He patted his pockets front and back, but found nothing.
0:39:23|0:39:28|After speaking, [Wang Bo] took an egg from the bag, and [Wang Li], who heard the noise, couldn't sit still again.
0:39:42|0:39:54|Nuo was holding an egg to give to Teacher Han, but was pulled back by [Wang Li]. Wang Bo, who had the egg, left the carriage and, led by the attendant, arrived at the upscale dining car on the train.
0:39:54|0:39:58|[Wang Bo] performed a magic trick in front of the flight attendant, making the egg disappear and reappear.
0:40:11|0:40:16|[Wang Bo] crossed over Xiao Ye and Uncle Li, sitting in the seat behind them, then put down what he was holding.
0:40:23|0:40:33|Spinning the cup with an egg in the air while shaking it.
0:40:33|0:40:38|He leaned his left elbow on the table, constantly shaking the cup, with a growing smile on his face.
0:40:38|0:40:43|Xiaoye and Uncle Li sat in the back seats, watching him show off without saying a word, in the blink of an eye.
0:40:43|0:40:53|Suddenly, some small pieces of eggshells fell along the cup's wall into the ashtray above the table, and the eggshells in the cup became fewer and fewer. Eventually, a peeled egg remained intact in the cup.
0:40:53|0:40:58|[Wang Bo] poured the eggs onto the plate, set the cup aside, and took a few bites of the eggs.
0:40:58|0:41:3|At the same time, Uncle Li stood up with a glass of wine and sat down across from [Wang Bo].
0:41:20|0:41:26|After speaking, [Wang Bo] smiled, Uncle Li remained silent, and Xiao Ye, who was still in place, suddenly sat next to Uncle Li and handed him an egg.
0:41:28|0:41:43|Uncle Li took the egg from Xiao Ye's hand, raised his hand and made the egg spin rapidly between his ring finger and thumb. His index finger controlled a blade, shaving off the eggshell as it spun. In the blink of an eye, it was shaved clean, and Wang Bo's smile gradually disappeared.
0:41:46|0:42:0|Uncle Li placed the peeled raw egg in the palm of his left hand, then raised his right hand, dropped the eggshell left in his hand, pinched the egg with both hands, placed it above a glass of beer, and gently squeezed to break the shell, letting the egg liquid mix with the beer in the glass.
0:42:12|0:42:16|[Wang Bo] turned his head to look at Siyan and Fatty eating at the next table.
0:42:52|0:42:54|Uncle Li glanced at Fatso and Four Eyes.
0:43:19|0:43:31|Uncle Li then returned to the sleeper compartment and as soon as he entered, he gave Siyan a slap in the face.
0:43:31|0:43:37|Four Eyes had blood coming out of the corner of his mouth, and he refused to turn his head. Wang Bo, feeling anxious, noticed this.
0:43:53|0:43:57|Siyan knelt beside Uncle Li, glaring defiantly with his eyes.
0:43:57|0:44:5|Uncle Li looked at him, suddenly smiled, then sighed while still smiling.
0:44:10|0:44:10|Uncle Li's expression changed in an instant.
0:44:10|0:44:12|Uncle Li's expression changed in an instant.
0:44:42|0:44:47|The fat guy hesitated for a moment, looked down at Siyan, and then obediently knelt down beside him.
0:44:47|0:44:49|Uncle Li said to Siyan.
0:45:0|0:45:8|On the other side, Sha Gen finished using the restroom, tidying up his pants while calling out to [Wang Bo].
0:45:8|0:45:12|Shagen patted [Wang Bo]'s arm, and [Wang Bo] looked at Shagen with tears in his eyes.
0:45:22|0:45:26|[Wang Bo] said nothing, bypassed Sha Gen directly, and walked to the window to look outside.
0:45:26|0:45:30|Shagen hurriedly caught up and anxiously asked.
0:45:30|0:45:38|[Wang Bo] finally spoke slowly, choking back tears.
0:46:26|0:46:30|[Wang Bo] showed great sincerity and emotion, crying with tears and snot flowing out.
0:46:30|0:46:34|Hearing what [Wang Bo] said, Shagen also cried.
0:47:5|0:47:8|[Wang Bo] gasped for breath while placing his hand on Sha Gen's shoulder.
0:47:25|0:47:27|The scene then cuts to the luxurious sleeper compartment of Uncle Li.
0:48:13|0:48:25|The fat man still knelt on the ground, expressing his dissatisfaction to Uncle Li.
0:48:25|0:48:32|Saying that, Fatso picked up a metal tool with a blade from the table next to him. Uncle Li turned his head to look at him, but said nothing.
0:48:32|0:48:35|On the other side, [Wang Bo] returned to his seat with Sha Gen.
0:48:40|0:48:42|[Wang Li] is somewhat skeptical of him.
0:48:45|0:48:47|Shagen looked out of the car window without saying a word.
0:48:48|0:48:51|He turned his head to look at [Wang Li].
0:48:52|0:48:57|[Wang Li] looked at Sha Gen's awkward smile, turned her head, and stared at [Wang Bo] with a suspicious look.
0:48:57|0:49:1|[Wang Bo] avoided his gaze and poked Shagen's leg with his hand.
0:49:27|0:49:31|Listening to Shagen's singing, [Wang Li] finally smiled and started singing along.
0:49:31|0:49:34|Before long, [Wang Bo] also started singing along.
0:49:34|0:49:51|Other people in the car were all drawn to the singing, some sticking their heads out to watch, while others pointed to their heads, pursing their lips to indicate that the singer was a bit crazy.
0:49:51|0:49:54|Shagen suddenly couldn't continue singing.
0:50:0|0:50:5|Shagen lowered his head, and Wang Bo suddenly spoke as he looked at him.
0:50:31|0:50:35|[Wang Bo] glanced at [Wang Li], then followed Shagen out of the carriage.
0:50:35|0:50:39|[Wang Li] turned to look at the backs of the two of them, not sure what they were up to.
0:50:39|0:50:44|Sha Gen and [Wang Bo] walked out of the carriage one after the other and arrived at the connecting point.
0:50:44|0:50:48|Shagen walked to the car window, leaned back, and then lowered his head to search in the bag.
0:50:48|0:50:56|[Wang Bo] casually closed the door of the carriage, stood opposite Sha Gen, and watched him take out a stack of money.
0:50:56|0:50:58|Wang Bo did not take the money, but instead supported his shoulder.
0:51:1|0:51:7|Wang Bo looked at [Sha Gen] in a daze, then tightly held [Sha Gen]'s hand holding the money.
0:51:36|0:51:45|He was saying no with his mouth, but when [Shagen] tried to put money into his pocket, he didn't avoid it at all, with a triumphant smile on his face.
0:51:45|0:51:53|[Shagen] returned to the compartment after stuffing the money. [Wang Bo] sensed something was wrong, walked to the window and questioned Wang Bo. Wang Bo directly took out a stack of banknotes from his pocket.
0:52:27|0:52:32|After speaking, [Wang Li] walked to the side, but Wang Bo didn't respond, only focused on counting money with her head down.
0:52:47|0:52:51|[Wang Li] snatched the money from [Wang Bo]'s hand and quickly turned around to walk back.
0:52:51|0:52:56|[Wang Bo] looked at the suddenly furious [Wang Li], feeling that the other party was very inexplicable, and he also had a lot of anger that had not been triggered.
0:52:56|0:53:1|He glanced at the back of [Wang Bo], then turned his head and leaned against the wall, feeling sulky.
0:53:1|0:53:6|[Wang Bo] then returned to the carriage and sat across from [Sha Gen], looking at him without saying a word for a long time.
0:53:6|0:53:9|[Shagen] looked up and met eyes with [Wang Bo], and soon tears started to fall down.
0:53:10|0:53:13|The eyes reveal an indescribable sadness.
0:53:13|0:53:17|[Wang Li] then straightened up, leaned forward, and forced a smile.
0:53:17|0:53:19|Shagen saw that the other party seemed to have something to say,
0:53:19|0:53:22|He sat up straight and leaned forward.
0:53:22|0:53:27|Watching Silly Root crying silently, [Wang Li]'s heart softened once again, and her own eyes turned red.
0:53:27|0:53:33|With a soft sigh, [Wang Bo] turned to [Wang Li] and said.
0:53:46|0:54:0|After speaking, she returned the money to Wang Bo.
0:54:6|0:54:9|[Wang Li] gently patted Sha Gen's face with her hand.
0:54:15|0:54:21|[Wang Li] nodded earnestly at Sha Gen, one hand touching her face, the other hand wiping away her tears.
0:54:21|0:54:25|The train had been running on the tracks for a long time, and the sky had completely darkened.
0:54:25|0:54:35|Uncle Li, wearing a coat and waving a torch, walked down the corridor of the luxurious sleeper car. As he walked, he used his hand to press on the metal tool with a blade that the fat man had once held.
0:54:36|0:54:41|He recalled the way Fatty looked before, and pulled open the curtain in front of him to look outside the car.
0:54:41|0:54:44|[Wang Li] suddenly lowered her head and walked out of the sleeper compartment.
0:54:44|0:54:48|He raised one hand and placed it on Uncle Li's left shoulder, then leaned slowly on it.
0:54:48|0:54:52|Uncle Li raised his right hand and patted [Wang Li]'s hand, sighing casually.
0:55:4|0:55:8|[Wang Li] handed a glass of wine to Uncle Li, and then gave him a hard pat on the back.
0:55:15|0:55:19|[Wang Li] said nothing, but lay on the bed and sat up to stretch her legs.
0:55:24|0:55:27|Uncle Li licked the wine spilled on his hand and sat down to speak.
0:55:51|0:55:54|Uncle Li leaned back in his chair, his face inscrutable.
0:55:54|0:56:0|After listening to Uncle Li's words, [Wang Li] walked out of the luxury sleeper car alone and entered the compartment where Sha Gen was.
0:56:0|0:56:6|At this moment, [Wang Bo] is washing his face in the bathroom, completely unaware that [Xiao Ye] has walked past him.
0:56:6|0:56:13|In the carriage, most people were already dozing off, leaning against the back of the seat with their eyes closed. [Wang Li] was also leaning against the back of the seat, resting with her eyes closed.
0:56:13|0:56:17|[Xiao Ye] slowly walked to the middle of the carriage and sat down sideways in a seat close to [Sha Gen].
0:56:18|0:56:31|She observed her surroundings calmly while skillfully twirling a delicate lighter between her fingertips. Upon hearing some movement beside her, [Wang Li] slowly opened her eyes, glanced lightly at her, tugged at her clothes, and then closed her eyes again to sleep.
0:56:31|0:56:43|[Ye Xiaoye] then took out a cigarette, put it in his mouth, lit it, and took out a lipstick from his pocket. He used the cigarette to burn the surface of the lipstick, pushed the lit part up, and flicked it directly into the pocket of a middle-aged man's military coat not far away.
0:56:45|0:56:56|A white smoke suddenly emerged from Wang Bo's coat pocket, and as the smoke thickened and the choking smell spread, the entire train compartment quickly became filled with smoke.
0:56:56|0:57:10|The middle-aged man wearing a Jun coat suddenly woke up choking on smoke. He opened his eyes in confusion and realized that the thick smoke was coming from his Jun coat. Panicked, he struggled to get up and yanked off the Jun coat, causing the female passenger next to him to start screaming.
0:57:14|0:57:24|[Wang Bo] heard the noise and stood up to rush out to help.
0:57:24|0:57:29|[Ye Xiaoye] took advantage of the chaos to cover a large piece of cloth over [Sha Gen]'s head, and [Teacher Han] also joined in.
0:57:29|0:57:32|In the blink of an eye, [Wang Bo]'s money was stolen by [Wang Li].
0:57:34|0:57:40|[Wang Li] stepped on the seat, pulled the cloth covering [Wang Bo]'s head down, and quickly walked to her back to check her bag.
0:57:40|0:57:44|The money wrapped in kraft paper inside has long been replaced by a large pack of tissues.
0:57:44|0:57:52|She angrily dragged [Wang Bo] back to his seat.
0:57:52|0:57:59|Just then, two police officers ran over with fire extinguishers, passing by the thief who stole money from [Wang Bo], Xiao Ye.
0:57:59|0:58:2|The police ran into the carriage, about to open the fire extinguisher, but was stopped by Teacher Han.
0:58:10|0:58:11|Wang Li next to him opened the car window.
0:58:14|0:58:18|[Wang Li] ran backwards while looking around for the figure of [Wang Bo].
0:58:18|0:58:26|In the background, the police can be heard asking if the passenger whose clothes caught fire was putting out a cigarette with coal. Faintly, the passenger can be heard replying that he has quit smoking for ten years.
0:58:26|0:58:34|[Wang Li] walked into a regular residential area and suddenly saw a woman who looked exactly like Xiao Ye in both clothing and hairstyle climbing up the stairs.
0:58:34|0:58:37|[Wang Li] pulled the other person down directly, only to realize that she had mistaken the person.
0:58:43|0:58:47|The woman was a bit persistent, but Xiao Ye, disguised as a pregnant woman, managed to get through.
0:58:47|0:58:53|As soon as she stepped out of the sleeper car, [Wang Bo] standing at the door yanked off her wig.
0:58:57|0:59:3|Xiaoye reached for the wig with one hand and pulled out a hairpin from her hair, stabbing towards [Wang Bo].
0:59:3|0:59:9|The two of them started fighting at the connection between the train carriages.
0:59:9|0:59:14|[Wang Bo] ran behind Xiao Ye and tried to control her, only to narrowly avoid being stabbed in the head by the tip of a hairpin.
0:59:14|0:59:19|Xiaoye casually shook the hairpin, and the decoration on the other end suddenly cracked open, turning into a small knife with a sharp blade.
0:59:19|0:59:24|[Wang Bo] held her waist with one hand and grabbed her arm with the other, trying to avoid the hairpin in the opponent's hand.
0:59:24|0:59:35|During the fight, even the sunglasses fell off. [Wang Bo] seized the opportunity and skillfully cut open Xiao Ye's clothes from the chest, revealing the wrapped package. [Wang Bo] then took the chance to catch it.
0:59:35|0:59:44|Xiaoye's clothes were torn open, revealing his underwear. He wrapped his clothes around him and kicked towards [Wang Bo]. In the midst of the fight, [Wang Bo] suddenly pushed Xiaoye into the corner of the wall.
0:59:49|1:0:2|During the banter, [Wang Bo] suddenly changed his expression, he hugged Xiao Ye lightly, a policeman passed by, looked at the two kissing in the corner, and interrupted them.
1:0:2|1:0:17|The police left after speaking, and as soon as Wang Bo stood up, he was immediately pulled back by Xiao Ye. Wang Bo smiled and opened Xiao Ye's torn clothes.
1:0:27|1:0:32|Xiaoye pushed Wang Bo away, rolled her eyes, and walked towards the carriages behind her.
1:0:32|1:0:41|[Wang Bo] watched as Xiaoye walked away, raised his hand to close the train door, then took out a plastic bag, wrapped up the snatched leather paper, tied a knot, and prepared to leave.
1:0:41|1:0:43|Just as he turned around, he bumped into [Wang Li].
1:1:2|1:1:6|[Wang Bo] turned his head back to the carriage while speaking as if nothing had happened.
1:1:6|1:1:12|[Wang Li] stood still, glancing at him askance without saying a word for a long time, then turned around and walked towards the carriage after a while.
1:1:12|1:1:25|She walked back to her seat in a daze, seeing [Wang Bo] with his hands crossed, leaning against the back of the chair, a wrinkled towel on his head, and his two feet placed on the seat opposite, next to which lay the silly root still asleep on the table.
1:1:25|1:1:32|[Wang Li] didn't say anything, but lifted her leg and kicked [Wang Bo]'s leg. Only then did [Wang Bo] put his leg down, moved to the side, and crossed his legs again.
1:1:32|1:1:40|[Wang Li] sat down, put the waist bag on her lap, glanced at the soundly sleeping Sha Gen, and then took out her own phone from the bag to start typing.
1:1:40|1:1:47|Before long, Wang Bo's phone rang. He took out his phone from his pocket, removed the towel covering his face, and opened the text message.
1:1:53|1:2:1|After Wang Bo finished reading the text message, he looked up at [Wang Li] and saw her staring blankly with lifeless eyes. He then lowered his head again to reply to her with a text message.
1:2:1|1:2:5|[Wang Li] opened the message immediately after receiving it, and the content was.
1:2:13|1:2:16|[Wang Li] fell into contemplation as she looked at the text message.
1:2:16|1:2:27|After a while, Wang Bo took [Wang Li]'s bag, pulled out a dry towel from it and handed it to her. He took her phone with his left hand, then raised his right hand, lightly wiped his own face, indicating her to go wash her face.
1:2:27|1:2:31|[Wang Li] raised her head and blinked, then got up and walked towards the restroom.
1:2:31|1:2:42|Wang Bo watched as [Wang Li] walked away, then reached inside his seat to take out the bundle of cash wrapped in brown paper. He held it up in front of the sleeping Sha Gen with a smug expression, then casually placed it into [Wang Li]'s bag.
1:2:42|1:2:49|On the other side of the luxurious sleeper compartment, Xiao Ye braided her originally loose hair and changed into a sexy halter dress.
1:2:49|1:2:55|Uncle Li leaned in and kissed her on the cheek, then cupped her face and gave her a peck.
1:3:20|1:3:27|On the other side, [Wang Li] was retching violently in the bathroom, while Wang Bo placed the suitcase and bag aside and went to help her.
1:4:11|1:4:16|Wang Bo and [Wang Li] got off the truck together. When [Wang Li] walked to a corridor, she suddenly hesitated.
1:4:30|1:4:35|[Wang Li] was stunned, she quickly lowered her head and rummaged through her bag.
1:4:35|1:4:43|[Wang Li] suddenly chuckled coldly.
1:4:43|1:4:46|Wang Bo grabs Wang Li who is about to leave.
1:4:59|1:5:2|Wang Bo reached out his left hand and patted Wang Li on the shoulder.
1:5:43|1:5:49|Upon hearing Wang Bo's words, Wang Li became somewhat angry. He shook off the other person's hand and spoke angrily.
1:6:5|1:6:11|Wang Bo suddenly slapped [Wang Li], then he reached out to touch [Wang Li]'s cheek.
1:6:27|1:6:37|[Wang Li] said nothing, just raised her head and glared at Wang Bo.
1:6:37|1:6:40|[Wang Li] suddenly took out a bank card from her pocket and slapped it on Wang Bo's face.
1:6:51|1:6:55|Wang Bo pressed Wang Li against the wall as she tried to leave.
1:6:55|1:6:57|Wang Li and Wang Bo looked at each other for a moment before speaking.
1:6:57|1:6:58|[Wang Bo] suddenly felt a bit confused.
1:7:20|1:7:30|After saying that, Teacher Han turned and left. Huang Li couldn't stop her tears from falling. Wang Bo was also a bit emotional at this moment. He pointed at him with his finger, his words trembling as he spoke.
1:7:52|1:7:55|[Wang Li] wanted to leave, but [Wang Bo] quickly reached out to stop her.
1:7:55|1:7:59|[Wang Li] gave him a glare and walked out from the other side of his body directly.
1:7:59|1:8:4|[Wang Bo] didn't stop this time, just stood there blankly, not knowing what to do.
1:8:4|1:8:10|[Wang Li] walked towards the direction of the train, and after a few steps, she saw the silly character standing not far away, looking around while eating eggs.
1:8:14|1:8:34|She hesitated for a moment, walked to the small stall selling snacks next to her and bought a tea egg, then quietly walked to Wang Bo's side, touched her neck, and softly asked her.
1:8:34|1:8:37|Shagen obediently took out an egg and handed it to [Wang Li].
1:8:37|1:8:41|[Wang Li] took the egg and glanced at it, then with a sudden movement of her body, she threw the egg out.
1:8:49|1:8:51|Shagen hurriedly reached into his pocket.
1:8:56|1:8:59|[Wang Li] indeed has an egg in her pocket.
1:9:12|1:9:19|[Wang Li] raised her hand and grabbed a handful of air in front of Sha Gen, then threw it into her bag.
1:9:19|1:9:27|Shagen obediently opened the bag and rummaged through it.
1:9:27|1:9:32|Shagen took out a large pack of gluten paper from his bag and looked at it in confusion.
1:9:44|1:9:56|The train is about to start, Teacher Han walks over and pats Sha Gen.
1:9:56|1:9:59|The train is about to start, Teacher Han walks over and pats Sha Gen on the shoulder.
1:10:17|1:10:20|Wang Li walked towards the car while looking back for something.
1:10:23|1:10:29|Wang Bo stood sideways not far away, watching the figure of [Wang Li] without moving or making a sound.
1:10:29|1:10:38|Soon, the train started again, and the once bustling transit station instantly became incredibly quiet, with a broken egg lying quietly in the middle of the tracks.
1:10:38|1:10:47|Wang Bo finally got on the car. He stood by the window at the connection of the carriages, looking a bit lonely from the back. Inside the carriage, Wang Li took out the demon-slaying pestle that Wang Bo had given her and asked.
1:10:52|1:10:54|[Wang Li] was stunned for a moment.
1:11:11|1:11:14|Sha Gen took the jingmochu from [Wang Li]'s hand and helped her put it around her neck.
1:11:14|1:11:21|[Wang Li] smiled, tapping the pestle rhythmically as she asked Sha Gen a question.
1:11:21|1:11:25|Shagen smiled and answered Wang Li's question, his innocent face filled with sincerity.
1:11:26|1:11:33|On the other side, [Wang Bo] was still standing at the connection of the train car, staring blankly. He had his hands on both walls, looking somewhat serious.
1:11:33|1:11:41|After a while, he suddenly walked into the bar in the left carriage, where Xiao Ye was sitting, drinking and flirting with a foreign man across from her.
1:11:41|1:11:50|[Wang Bo] sat in an empty seat, placed his bag aside. Not far away, the fat man also noticed him. Xiao Ye then held up a bottle of beer, sat opposite [Wang Bo], crossed his legs, and greeted him.
1:11:55|1:12:3|He stared at Wang Bo intently, then raised his left hand to hook the strap on the right shoulder of the suspender skirt. Wang Bo was too busy drinking and didn't pay any attention to him.
1:12:20|1:12:22|At this moment, Uncle Li also noticed them.
1:12:35|1:12:40|The fat man not far away walked to the bar and whispered something to Glasses, whose expression looked hesitant.
1:13:6|1:13:9|Xiaoye looked at [Wang Bo] and nodded again.
1:13:9|1:13:16|[Wang Bo] then picked up a piece of ice from the cup on the table, held it in his hand, and said to Xiao Ye.
1:13:24|1:13:41|Upon hearing what [Wang Bo] said, Uncle Li turned his head to look at him. He saw [Wang Bo] forcefully throw the ice cube in his palm upwards. In the split second when the ice cube was thrown out, Uncle Li suddenly stood up, his face looking a bit off. [Wang Bo] stared intently at the falling ice cube, while Xiaoye had the opposite reaction.
1:13:41|1:14:12|With a smile on his face, [Wang Bo] looked at Wang Li across from him. Just before the ice cube fell, Uncle Li turned his head and walked away. The ice cube fell into the wine, splashing a small splash. [Wang Bo] reached out to grab it, but Xiao Ye directly pulled the tablecloth over and snatched the wine glass, leaning back on the sofa and laughing happily.
1:14:12|1:14:15|Xiaoye raised his glass and drank it all in one gulp, including the ice cubes in the wine bag.
1:14:15|1:14:17|[Wang Bo] looked at her and suddenly smiled.
1:14:17|1:14:20|Uncle Li also walked up to the fat man at this time and said unhappily.
1:14:26|1:14:34|Li Shujing stopped and left the bar, Fatso turned around and glanced at Xiaoye, cursing under his breath.
1:14:34|1:14:38|Xiao Ye proudly leaned on Wang Bo's shoulder, sitting beside him, and Wang Bo showed no sign of being downcast.
1:14:51|1:15:0|Xiaoye suddenly fell down, and on the sofa next to him, Teacher Han was sitting there observing them.
1:15:0|1:15:3|Wang Bo looked at Xiao Ye and slowly lowered his head to speak to him.
1:15:16|1:15:26|Xiaoye leaned back on the sofa, her body suddenly went limp, the train conductor warned, and Han, who was originally in the bar, appeared at the door holding a police badge.
1:15:26|1:15:32|Teacher Han turned out to be a police officer. He then walked into the conductor's room, opened his laptop, and started speaking.
1:15:36|1:15:41|Sitting in front of the computer, [Wang Bo] hurriedly operated the mouse after hearing the news, and opened the photo gallery on the computer.
1:15:41|1:15:51|Teacher Han then pulled out an electronic pen from the side of his laptop, tapped on the screen a few times, and the dual portrait sketches of Wang [Bo] and [Wang Li] appeared directly on the screen.
1:15:51|1:15:58|Teacher Han immediately printed this image into a photo, got up and handed it to Cheng Jing, who was operating on the computer.
1:16:14|1:16:17|Wang Bo flipped through the files in the library quickly.
1:16:17|1:16:22|In the carriage, Sha Gen was sound asleep on the table when Wang [Li] suddenly reached out and patted his shoulder.
1:16:28|1:16:34|Shagen obediently took the backpack off his neck and handed it to [Wang Li], then lay back on the table and fell asleep again.
1:16:34|1:16:44|[Wang Li] took the bag, stood up and walked to the opposite side of Sha Gen, placed the bag inside, then lay down and adjusted her position while taking out her phone from her pocket.
1:16:49|1:16:56|He looked at the sentence, and his mood improved a lot in an instant. A smile suddenly appeared on his face that was originally full of worries.
1:17:12|1:17:19|Outside the car window, as the sky gradually darkened, [Wang Bo] sat alone in a corner with his hands crossed, staring blankly, placing his bag by his feet.
1:17:19|1:17:28|Fatty and Four Eyes suddenly opened the carriage door and walked out. Fatty kicked Wang Bo's leg, making Wang Bo annoyed, who then scolded in a bad mood.
1:17:33|1:17:35|The fat man then squatted down and patted his leg.
1:17:45|1:17:48|Four Eyes looked provocatively at [Wang Bo], who remained silent.
1:17:48|1:17:55|After a while, the three of them climbed onto the roof of the train together, and the train was speeding along the deserted mountain railway tracks.
1:17:55|1:18:3|[Wang Bo] stood in front, his hair tousled by the wind. He raised his arm and shouted towards the cave hundreds of meters away, calling out to Fatty and Four Eyes.
1:18:20|1:18:23|The fat guy stood with his hands on his hips, letting Siyan and [Wang Bo] compare their courage.
1:18:23|1:18:27|[Wang Bo] heard the movement behind him, smiled slightly, and did not turn around.
1:18:27|1:18:32|Siyan obediently walked to the right side of [Wang Bo], who glanced at him and then grabbed his hand.
1:18:32|1:18:36|Siyan felt a little nervous and unconsciously took a small step back.
1:18:36|1:18:41|Not far behind the three of them, Uncle Li quietly climbed up, showing his head, quietly observing them.
1:18:41|1:18:44|As the Li Mountain Cave drew closer, [Wang Bo] still had a smile on his face.
1:18:45|1:18:50|Wang Bo's expression became increasingly tense, while the chubby person standing behind had already crouched down in advance.
1:18:50|1:18:56|Just before reaching the cave, Wang Bo remained motionless, but suddenly burst into tears.
1:19:0|1:19:7|Four Eyes shouted loudly while crouching and dodging, but [Wang Bo] persisted until the last second before hitting the cave, then leaned back and dodged.
1:19:7|1:19:16|The swift and sharp gust of wind blew her wig off, catching Li Shu, who was secretly observing from behind, off guard. Wang Bo crouched on the car roof, holding his head in a very embarrassed manner.
1:19:16|1:19:21|Just as the train was about to leave the cave, the fat man in the back suddenly stood up and kicked [Wang Bo] down with one foot.
1:19:21|1:19:25|[Wang Bo] is lying on the roof of the car, desperately dodging the attacks from the fat man.
1:19:25|1:19:30|Just as he stood up, Wang Bo accidentally stepped on the wig that Uncle Li had thrown over, rolling towards the edge of the train.
1:19:30|1:19:34|At the critical moment, [Uncle Li] suddenly rushed over and grabbed [Wang Bo]'s hand.
1:19:34|1:19:38|[Wang Bo] fell completely out of the train, very dangerous.
1:20:26|1:20:31|After speaking, [Uncle Li] pulled [Wang Bo] up with force, and [Wang Bo] lay down on the top of the train.
1:20:34|1:20:37|He widened his eyes, continuously patting his chest, and didn't stand up for a long time.
1:20:37|1:20:42|After a moment, he followed [Uncle Li] and climbed into the carriage through the side window of the train.
1:20:42|1:20:45|Just as he turned around to leave, [Uncle Li] called out to him.
1:20:47|1:20:49|[Wang Bo] turned his head to look at [Uncle Li].
1:21:19|1:21:26|[Uncle Li] clasped his hands together in a gesture of respect towards [Wang Bo], who returned the gesture with a fist. Then, [Wang Bo] turned and opened the door of the carriage, smiling as he walked inside.
1:21:26|1:21:29|Uncle Li watched his back without saying another word.
1:21:29|1:21:34|Soon after, Siyan and Fatty also climbed in. As soon as Fatty steadied himself, he began to compliment [Uncle Li].
1:21:48|1:21:51|Siyan glanced at Uncle Li, then obediently walked up to him.
1:21:51|1:21:54|The fat guy didn't say a word, but turned his body to look outside.
1:22:17|1:22:23|Uncle Li grabbed Siyan's right hand and broke his middle finger, causing Siyan to collapse in pain in Uncle Li's arms.
1:22:23|1:22:28|Fatty finally turned around to look at the back of Uncle Li's head, his face revealing fear.
1:22:28|1:22:30|On the other side, [Wang Bo] returned to the carriage and woke up [Wang Li].
1:22:41|1:22:48|After speaking, [Wang Bo] smiled at [Wang Li], who looked at him with a worried expression on her face.
1:22:48|1:22:51|[Wang Li] felt a bit guilty, but [Wang Bo] suddenly laughed.
1:22:56|1:23:1|As soon as the words fell, Wang Bo's smile disappeared, and her expression suddenly became somewhat serious.
1:23:1|1:23:6|[Wang Li] followed her gaze and saw Uncle Li and Xiao Ye suddenly appear at the door of the carriage.
1:23:6|1:23:13|Xiao Ye leaned against the door frame with her hands crossed, while Uncle Li slowly walked to a position not far from them and sat down with his hands behind his back.
1:23:13|1:23:18|They observed each other, and after a long moment of eye contact, [Wang Bo] suddenly turned his head to look at [Wang Li].
1:23:18|1:23:23|[Wang Li] looked at Uncle Li for a moment, then lowered her head and spoke.
1:23:41|1:23:45|[Wang Bo], who has always been carefree, appeared unusually serious at this moment.
1:23:45|1:23:49|[Wang Li] didn't speak anymore, but watched Uncle Li not far away with [Wang Bo].
1:23:49|1:23:52|Uncle Li still maintained a smiling expression as he watched them.
1:23:52|1:24:3|After a while, Wang Li turned around and glanced at Xiao Ye leaning against the door frame. Xiao Ye seemed to have received some message, took a few steps forward, and sat in the empty seat behind Uncle Wang. Both sides became somewhat tense at this moment.
1:24:3|1:24:6|Just then, the train's announcement suddenly came on.
1:24:18|1:24:27|Teacher Han heard the noise and walked out of the carriage directly, while Wang Bo, who was originally sleeping, also woke up.
1:24:27|1:24:36|Shagen acts on impulse, ready to leave as soon as he stands up, but [Wang Bo] quickly reaches out to stop him.
1:25:2|1:25:11|[Wang Bo] stood up and sat next to Sha Gen to shield him, then exchanged a glance with [Wang Li], turned to look at Uncle Li who was staring at him, and Sha Gen patted [Wang Bo] on the shoulder and persuaded.
1:25:23|1:25:31|[Wang Li] hung Shagen's bag back around her neck. Shagen obediently lowered his head to take the backpack, then placed it on the side, smiling as he turned to go donate blood.
1:25:31|1:25:40|[Wang Li] looked at [Wang Bo] with a worried expression in her eyes, then turned back and saw [Wang Bo] getting ready to catch up with her. [Wang Bo] comfortingly patted her shoulder, then smiled and walked ahead.
1:25:40|1:25:45|Her eyes drifted between Wang Bo's bag and Uncle Li, seeing Uncle Li also looking at her with a mysterious smile.
1:25:45|1:25:50|His expression became more alert, [Wang Li] remained in her seat, still not very reassured.
1:25:50|1:25:55|He leaned forward slightly, tilting his head to focus on the moving scene ahead, the camera switching back and forth between the faces of three people.
1:25:55|1:26:2|As Wang Bo passed by Uncle Li and continued to walk forward, Uncle Li remained motionless, eerily quiet.
1:26:2|1:26:5|[Wang Bo] forced a smile and continued to walk forward with Sha Gen.
1:26:5|1:26:11|Not long after walking a few steps, Wang Bo saw an old man wearing a duckbill cap standing on the seat, tilting his head back and searching for something on the luggage rack.
1:26:11|1:26:15|In the front row of the old man is a young mother holding a baby.
1:26:15|1:26:21|[Wang Bo] had a somewhat bad premonition, the smile on his face completely disappeared, while the smile on Uncle Li's face suddenly became more apparent.
1:26:21|1:26:27|Sure, in the next second, the old man searching for luggage accidentally knocked over a huge metal thermos from the luggage rack.
1:26:28|1:26:35|[Wang Bo] rushed up immediately, just before the cup was about to hit the baby, he reached out and caught the cup, returning it to the old man.
1:26:35|1:26:44|[Wang Bo] then turned his head to look for Sha Gen's figure, only to see him walking to the door of the carriage, passing by a conductor pushing a temporary cart. At that moment, the train happened to pass through a tunnel.
1:26:45|1:26:52|The carriage suddenly became dark, and [Wang Bo] muttered that it was not good. He quickly took a few steps to catch up with Sha Gen, only to be blocked by Xiao Ye the next second.
1:26:52|1:27:2|They fought in the darkness, with [Wang Bo] landing a punch on Xiao Ye's stomach, lifting him up and throwing him backwards from above. Xiao Ye suddenly flew up and then fell heavily to the ground.
1:27:2|1:27:10|[Wang Bo] quickly ran a few steps to get behind Sha Gen, and opened his bag. The money wrapped in kraft paper inside had disappeared without a trace.
1:27:10|1:27:17|[Wang Bo] reached into the bag and took out a neatly folded piece of paper. After unfolding it, three words were written on it: "You lost," followed by an exclamation mark.
1:27:33|1:27:41|Shagen waved to Wang Bo, walked towards the writing room without looking back, Wang Bo slowly returned to the carriage with extremely slow steps.
1:27:41|1:27:47|He glanced at Uncle Li with the corner of his eye as he walked forward, and Uncle Li still maintained a smiling expression leaning back in his chair watching him.
1:27:47|1:27:55|[Wang Bo] walked up to [Wang Li] and handed him the note in his hand. [Wang Li] took the note, glanced at it, and then looked up at Uncle Li as he spoke.
1:28:1|1:28:14|[Wang Bo] didn't say a word. Instead, he put a cigarette in his mouth, leaned back on the chair for a while, then lowered his head to light the cigarette. In his mind, he recalled the baby who was almost hit by the kettle just now, and the old man who accidentally knocked the kettle off the luggage rack.
1:28:14|1:28:24|[Wang Bo] looked up and saw Uncle Li not far away. Four Eyes walked to Uncle Li's side, lifted his shirt, and took out the stolen money from under his left arm with his right hand wrapped in a bandage, handing it directly to Uncle Li.
1:28:25|1:28:37|Uncle Li took the money with a smile, held it in front of him for a while, then looked at Wang Bo with a victorious smile. Just as he was feeling pleased with himself, he heard Sizhi suddenly whispering in his ear.
1:28:42|1:29:0|Uncle Li's smile disappeared instantly, he glanced at Wang Bo with the corner of his eye, then stared at [Wang Bo], lost in thought. After a few minutes, he stood up from his seat, holding the money in his left hand, walked step by step to sit opposite [Wang Bo], placed the money on the table, and sighed with pursed lips.
1:29:0|1:29:7|[Wang Bo] held [Wang Li]'s arm with one hand, watching the menacing Mr. Li approach. Mr. Li spoke slowly.
1:29:24|1:29:31|[Wang Bo] looked at the leather finger wind on the table, with a somewhat inexplicable expression.
1:29:31|1:29:36|Wang Bo said nothing as Uncle Li suddenly sat up and patted Wang Bo's hand.
1:29:39|1:29:54|Uncle Li finished speaking and then stood up, walking out of the carriage with his hands behind his back. [Wang Li] lowered her head and opened the cowhide paper package in front of her, only to find two towers of Ming coins inside.
1:30:24|1:30:36|On the other side, as soon as Uncle Li stepped out of the carriage, he was immediately held at gunpoint to his head.
1:30:36|1:30:43|Three masked individuals rushed in.
1:30:47|1:30:51|Uncle Li was punched by a robber right after making a sarcastic comment.
1:30:51|1:30:58|In the blood room, a thick needle is inserted into the vein of [Wang Bo], causing him to tremble in pain and slowly turn his head.
1:30:58|1:31:6|The nurse wearing a mask comforted him while drawing blood, [Wang Bo] kept his eyes closed, still too afraid to look down.
1:31:6|1:31:12|In the carriage, Uncle Li had a gun pointed at his head, while another tall and thin bandit held a gun at the other passengers.
1:31:16|1:31:26|The chubby robber turned his head and saw [Wang Li], he suddenly froze.
1:31:26|1:31:27|He walked towards [Wang Li] with an axe in his hand.
1:32:6|1:32:8|[Wang Bo] suddenly lifted the fake money on the table.
1:32:29|1:32:36|The chubby robber swung the axe at the chair next to [Wang Bo]'s head, snatching the cowhide paper envelope from his hand, and the paper money inside scattered all over the floor.
1:32:36|1:32:38|The chubby robber picked up a walkie-talkie and turned his head, saying,
1:32:40|1:32:43|Fat Jaffe suddenly turned around and cursed, [Wang Bo] said.
1:33:10|1:33:30|The chubby robber, with a lewd smile, bent down and touched the woman's waist, but his smile froze on his face the next second.
1:33:33|1:33:37|The fat robber didn't say a word for half a day, but the thin robber was getting anxious.
1:33:41|1:33:50|The chubby robber slowly got up, with a look of horror on his face.
1:33:50|1:34:1|Uncle Li seized the gun from the robber next to him, holding him hostage, while the female police officer then aimed her gun at another person.
1:34:1|1:34:6|The middle-aged man, Wang Bo, looked dumbfounded with a gun pointed at him.
1:34:6|1:34:10|The old man who helped [Uncle Li] with the coordination before was also brought out.
1:34:10|1:34:13|The policewoman then pointed her gun at Four Eyes' hat.
1:34:18|1:34:24|The man next to the actor was also arrested. In the luxurious sleeper compartment, Xiao Ye stood in front of the mirror, putting on a police uniform.
1:34:24|1:34:28|[Uncle Li] peeked at him, then sat back in his chair and gestured with both hands.
1:34:36|1:34:38|Xiao Ye sat in the arms of [Uncle Li] and asked.
1:34:57|1:35:7|Xiao Ye pondered for a moment, then stood up from [Uncle Li]'s arms, slowly turned around and sat on the sofa behind him, holding a pair of handcuffs in his hands, pursing his lips and looking up at [Uncle Li].
1:35:9|1:35:14|[Uncle Li] looked up at Xiao Ye, didn't say a word, but his eyes seemed to convey trust.
1:35:14|1:35:19|Xiaoye looked at him and had to lower his head to prop up [Uncle Li]'s hand.
1:35:24|1:35:28|After speaking, [Uncle Li] raised his hand and rubbed his eyes.
1:36:42|1:36:46|Shagen was placed in a luxurious sleeper compartment with no one around, sleeping soundly.
1:36:46|1:36:49|[Wang Bo] sat at the door with his head propped up, lost in thought.
1:36:49|1:36:53|[Wang Li] sat in front of the bed, holding Sha Gen's bag, quietly watching him.
1:37:21|1:37:26|The tattered cloth bag held by [Wang Li] was squeezed tighter and tighter by Sha Gen, almost deformed.
1:37:26|1:37:29|Wang Bo is still sleeping soundly, showing no signs of waking up.
1:37:29|1:37:34|[Wang Li] looked at the sleeping Sha Gen in front of her, with a mixture of worry and sadness on her face.
1:37:34|1:37:40|[Wang Bo] walked to the door and pressed his ear against it to listen to the sounds outside.
1:37:40|1:37:45|Then he walked to [Wang Li]'s side, pinched her shoulder, and sat down to her right rear.
1:37:45|1:37:51|[Wang Li] kept staring at Sha Gen, and then [Wang Bo] bent down, gently putting his arm around [Wang Li]'s shoulder, comforting her warmly.
1:37:56|1:38:0|[Wang Bo] looked at [Wang Li] seriously, and [Wang Li] looked up at him without saying a word.
1:38:0|1:38:9|[Wang Bo] then took the bag from [Wang Li]'s arms, placed it on the inner side of the bed, adjusted the straps, gently touched Sha Gen's cheek, and lightly patted her.
1:38:9|1:38:17|At that moment, the sleeper door suddenly opened, and Teacher Han walked in.
1:38:31|1:38:37|Teacher Han took out the money wrapped in parchment paper from his arms and put it back into Sha Gen's bag.
1:38:37|1:38:40|[Wang Bo] supported [Wang Li] and turned to sit on the bench opposite the bed.
1:38:40|1:38:46|After Mr. Han placed the money, he sat on the bed and straightened his clothes, then said to them.
1:38:52|1:38:58|Listening to Teacher Han's question, [Wang Bo] remained silent and instead looked down at his fingers.
1:40:49|1:40:53|Teacher Han then pulled out a photo of [Wang Bo] and [Wang Li].
1:41:15|1:41:22|Teacher Han walked out of the luxurious sleeper car alone, took off his coat, sat on the chair by the door, and casually placed a pair of handcuffs aside.
1:41:22|1:41:28|Two city police officers walked over, with one of them sitting beside him and saying.
1:41:42|1:41:44|In the sleeper compartment, Xiao Ye is feeding water to Uncle Li.
1:42:10|1:42:14|Listening to Uncle Li's words, Xiao Ye suddenly burst into tears and squatted beside Uncle Li.
1:42:30|1:42:35|Xiaoye took off the police cap from his head, put it on Uncle Li's face, and then opened the door and ran out to surrender.
1:42:35|1:42:43|Teacher Han heard the noise and pinned him at the door.
1:42:43|1:42:48|Uncle Li lay on the sofa and took off his police cap from his face.
1:42:48|1:42:53|Teacher Han sat across from Uncle Li with a gun in his hand.
1:42:53|1:42:56|Uncle Li nodded and said self-deprecatingly.
1:42:58|1:43:1|Teacher Han goes outside and checks his phone.
1:43:28|1:43:32|In another luxurious sleeper compartment, [Wang Bo] and [Wang Li] are cuddling together.
1:43:37|1:43:41|Take advantage of the fact that the child has not yet acknowledged the situation.
1:44:3|1:44:8|Listening to the harsh words from [Wang Bo], [Wang Li] showed no fear at all, but instead smiled and reached out to touch his face.
1:44:19|1:44:35|The sunlight outside the car window shines through the curtains onto them. [Wang Li] is lying in [Wang Bo]'s arms, one hand on her belly and the other tightly holding [Wang Bo]'s right hand. [Wang Bo] hugs her tightly as they gaze deeply into each other's eyes, as if wanting to engrave each other's features in their minds.
1:44:35|1:44:43|After a while, [Wang Bo] gently caressed his body, lightly kissed [Wang Li]'s forehead, paused for a moment, and then kissed the other's eyes.
1:44:44|1:44:50|[Wang Li] closed her eyes and quietly savored the kiss from her lover, both of them enjoying the rare moment of tranquility.
1:44:50|1:45:5|Just as Wang Bo and Wang Li were quietly leaning against each other, Uncle Li in the luxurious sleeper compartment next door took advantage of the lack of supervision, raised his hand, took off a button from his clothes, and found a needle hidden in the button. He used this needle to secretly unlock the handcuffs, and then opened the ventilation opening above his head.
1:45:5|1:45:19|First he threw the coat up, then climbed up himself. He then took a long cylindrical bag from nearby, unzipped the bag, took out a pair of rubber shoes from the compartment, and then pulled out a small bundle of rope with iron hooks from the shoes.
1:45:19|1:45:29|Just as he was about to change clothes, he suddenly heard some movement behind him. He quietly crouched down and saw [Wang Bo] helping [Wang Li] climb out from a ventilation duct not far in front of him.
1:45:29|1:45:35|They quietly crawled forward along the wooden planks, and after observing them for a while, [Uncle Li] also followed suit and crawled forward.
1:45:35|1:45:48|After climbing for a while, [Uncle Li] suddenly stopped next to the ventilation opening where [Wang Bo] and [Wang Li] climbed out. He leaned over the opening and saw Shagen sound asleep below, so he quietly took out the rope with a hook, and slowly lowered it down.
1:45:49|1:46:0|The rope smoothly hooked onto the bag beside Wang Bo. [Uncle Li] pulled the rope slowly upwards without making any sound, while Wang Bo on the bed didn't notice any movement at all.
1:46:0|1:46:9|Wang Bo and Wang Li, who had been crawling forward for a long time, finally arrived under the skylight. Wang Bo pushed open the iron window above his head with force, looked around, while Wang Li squatted quietly on the side, waiting.
1:46:10|1:46:21|Beside the air vent, [Uncle Li] has successfully obtained Sha Gen's bag. He puts the bag in his left hand, bends down, and reaches out to close the small wooden door of the air vent. Everything goes so smoothly.
1:46:21|1:46:32|He observed [Wang Li] and [Wang Bo] in front of him with joy, planning to put away the rope he had just used. However, he exerted too much force while retracting the rope, causing the end with the hook to suddenly hit the iron pillar.
1:46:33|1:46:42|The crisp voice instantly reached the ears of [Wang Li] ahead, she paused for a moment, and the supposed-to-be-arrested [Uncle Li] unexpectedly appeared behind her, holding Shagen's bag.
1:46:42|1:46:50|[Wang Li] saw this moment and became anxious. She quickly pulled [Wang Bo] down and said urgently.
1:47:6|1:47:10|[Wang Bo] used all his strength to tightly hold onto [Wang Li], not letting her go.
1:47:10|1:47:14|[Wang Li] viciously bites Wang Bo's arm, then slowly releases it.
1:47:14|1:47:18|She turned her head to look at [Wang Bo], then turned back to see Uncle Li climbing towards them.
1:47:18|1:47:21|In the end, they decided to listen to [Wang Bo] and trust him once.
1:47:22|1:47:30|[Wang Li] slowly got up and climbed out of the skylight with the help of [Wang Bo].
1:47:30|1:47:34|[Wang Li] then took off the silly root and put her fragrant magic pestle around [Wang Bo]'s neck.
1:47:37|1:47:46|[Wang Li] knelt on top of the train, holding [Wang Bo]'s face in her hands, pleading. She looked deeply into [Wang Bo]'s eyes, then kissed him deeply on the neck.
1:47:46|1:47:57|[Wang Bo] raised his hand to embrace her, responding affectionately. They both closed their eyes simultaneously, feeling each other's breath with their hearts. An indescribable atmosphere of sadness spread between them.
1:47:57|1:48:13|After a while, [Wang Li] climbed to the top of the train along the ladder on the side, then leaped down with force. She stood up, looked back, and ran in the opposite direction. Meanwhile, [Wang Bo], who had bid farewell to his lover, climbed down from the top of the train. She knelt on one knee, quietly waiting for Uncle Li to approach.
1:48:15|1:48:22|Uncle Li, not far away, crawled step by step, his pace showing no signs of hesitation, as if carrying a fierce determination to win.
1:48:22|1:48:26|[Wang Bo] maintained the same posture, staring motionlessly at Uncle Li.
1:48:26|1:48:38|And at this moment, Uncle Li had already crawled up to [Wang Bo]. He knelt on the ground to catch his breath for a moment, then slowly lifted his head, looking at the blue deer tiger in front of him. After a brief pause, he began to speak while catching his breath.
1:48:43|1:48:46|Uncle Li gasped for breath and casually raised the bag in his hand.
1:48:57|1:49:7|The two rushed forward at the same time, clasping hands as they confronted each other on the speeding train. [Wang Bo] stared at Uncle Li, sweat dripping down his cheeks.
1:49:7|1:49:17|With the sound of roaring, the train arrived. The police escorted Wang Bo, Wang Li, and several other henchmen of Uncle Li, as well as a few robbers who suddenly appeared along the way, onto the police car.
1:49:20|1:49:27|On the other side of the train, an old man with a large suitcase on his back, a backpack on his shoulder, and a water bottle, was walking out with the crowd.
1:49:27|1:49:33|He hunched his back, wearing a hat and sunglasses, holding a cane in one hand, taking small steps forward, feeling his way bit by bit.
1:49:33|1:49:39|However, as he walked along, he was stopped by a fully armed police officer raising his hand.
1:49:39|1:49:42|The person disguised as a blind old man is actually Wang Bo in disguise.
1:49:43|1:49:46|Facing the police officers all around him, [Wang Bo] remains calm and composed.
1:49:46|1:49:51|He pretended to be blind and reached out to touch the police officer's neck and cheek.
1:50:1|1:50:7|He raised his arm and patted the police officer's shoulder, then continued to carry the load on his back, turning to walk in another direction.
1:50:7|1:50:13|However, after walking a few steps, Uncle Li suddenly stopped and looked at the increasing number of police officers in front of him, then he suddenly turned around.
1:50:13|1:50:18|However, just as he took two steps, Wang Bo was stopped in his tracks. He trembled as he raised his hand and touched the handcuffs in front of him.
1:50:30|1:50:35|Uncle Li finally put on the handcuffs tremblingly.
1:50:35|1:50:39|Uncle Li was finally arrested, and the story on the train came to an end.
1:50:39|1:50:43|Five months later, Teacher Han walked into a restaurant alone.
1:50:43|1:50:47|He folded up an umbrella, shook off the water on it, and then placed it at the door.
1:50:47|1:50:50|Sitting across from them was [Wang Li], who was devouring a burrito.
1:50:51|1:51:6|[Wang Li] held a pancake in both hands, looked up at Teacher Han, didn't speak, hesitated for a moment, stuffed the pancake into her mouth, then lowered her head again. One hand held the pancake, the other hand picked up some roast duck, shredded scallions, and shredded cucumber, put them on the pancake, and rolled it up.
1:51:8|1:51:14|[Wang Li] continued to ignore Teacher Han, just focusing on stuffing food into her mouth one bite after another.
1:51:14|1:51:17|At this moment, [Wang Li] is obviously already a mom-to-be.
1:51:17|1:51:21|She was wearing a loose dress, her belly bulging, with long hair loosely tied behind her head.
1:51:21|1:51:24|She finished eating a pancake and continued to wrap another one.
1:51:24|1:51:32|Teacher Han stood by the dining table and watched her for a long time, then pulled out a chair, placed her handbag on the left side of the table, and sat opposite her.
1:51:45|1:51:50|The scene suddenly flashed back to that day, with the train still speeding along the tracks.
1:51:50|1:51:55|A hand covered in blood, holding Sha Gen's bag, reached down from the ventilation opening on top of the train.
1:51:55|1:52:1|The hand trembled as it dropped the package next to [Wang Bo]'s head, a drop of blood falling on his cheek.
1:52:1|1:52:6|Shagen's eyes were tightly closed, his eyelashes trembling slightly, as if sensing something, but still not waking up.
1:52:7|1:52:15|After a moment, the hand slowly retracted back, and before leaving the vent, it closed the small wooden door that had been opened.
1:52:15|1:52:22|The camera moves up through a ventilation shaft, a small puddle of blood drips onto a wooden board, and the hand that was just there lies limp on the side.
1:52:23|1:52:32|The owner of the hand is Wang Bo, who stayed behind to fight with Uncle Li. He squinted his eyes slightly, with a blood mark on his cheek, and a small magic pestle given to him by Wang Li hanging around his neck.
1:52:32|1:52:39|His left hand was placed in front of his chest, loosely holding a cellphone with the external screen lit up, displaying an unsent message.
1:52:40|1:52:48|His palms and arms were covered with scars cut by Uncle Li, and they fought to the death in such a confined space.
1:52:48|1:52:53|And at the last moment, [Wang Bo] successfully snatched the bag back from Uncle Li's hands for Sha Gen.
1:52:53|1:53:0|And at that moment, Uncle Li forcefully threw the rope with an iron hook in his hand backwards, halfway through he suddenly pulled it back.
1:53:0|1:53:10|[Wang Bo] was unable to dodge, the iron hook pierced into his neck. He lay on the ground, clenching his right fist and pounding the wooden board beneath him with force, while his neck was tightly strangled by the rope held by Uncle Li behind him.
1:53:10|1:53:14|The sound of [Wang Bo] tapping on the wooden board successfully reached Teacher Han's ears.
1:53:14|1:53:21|He stood in the corridor outside the luxurious sleeper compartment, looked up, sensed something was wrong, and quickly turned around to go into the compartment to check the situation.
1:53:21|1:53:29|The sleeper compartment door lock had been deliberately damaged, and despite his best efforts, he could only push open a small gap, not even able to stick his head in.
1:53:30|1:53:36|After observing for a moment outside the door, he turned around and walked out of the carriage, climbing onto the roof of the train using the ladder on the side.
1:53:36|1:53:40|After a brief inspection, Teacher Han and a K-9 officer opened the skylight on the roof of the train.
1:53:42|1:53:47|The dazzling sunlight shone through the skylight, reflecting on the lifeless face of [Wang Bo].
1:53:47|1:53:53|Teacher Han lay on the roof of the car, looking directly at [Wang Bo], then reached out and took his phone from [Wang Bo]'s chest.
1:53:57|1:54:1|Teacher Han didn't turn off the phone, but sent out this message.
1:54:1|1:54:6|He helped [Wang Bo] complete the last thing the other person wanted to do before his life disappeared.
1:54:6|1:54:10|The scene returns to the restaurant, where Teacher Han tells everything to [Wang Li].
1:54:31|1:54:49|After Mr. Han finished speaking, he left the restaurant with his bag. [Wang Li] leaned back in her chair, showing no reaction to Mr. Han's words. Her expression was somewhat blank, staying motionless for a while before snapping out of it. She then straightened up, propped herself on the armrest of the chair, and continued to pick up food with her chopsticks.
1:54:49|1:54:56|Wang Li's increasingly red eyes clearly revealed her emotions. She held back her sadness and took another pancake rolled with roast duck to eat.
1:54:57|1:55:4|He mechanically stuffed food into his mouth, chewing mechanically, with sauce smeared all over the corners of his mouth and he didn't bother to wipe it off.
1:55:4|1:55:10|He rolled up one pancake after another and stuffed them into his mouth, his movements becoming more and more sloppy, not even wrapping the cucumber properly before stuffing it into his mouth.
1:55:10|1:55:21|Finally, at this moment, tears couldn't be held back anymore. [Wang Bo] couldn't help but cry, but he continued to eat without stopping. He cried while eating, but still managed to hold back from making any sound.
1:55:26|1:55:33|At this moment, [Wang Li] seems like a child who has been wronged, as if only food can give her a sense of security.
1:55:33|1:55:37|The truth was right in front of her, and she could no longer deceive herself.
1:55:37|1:55:42|At that moment, she realized clearly that [Wang Bo] was already dead and there was no way to come back.
1:55:42|1:55:46|She lost the love of her life, the child in her belly, and no longer had a father.
1:56:15|1:56:24|Time flies, and it's winter again. [Wang Li], dressed in winter clothes and wearing the same pair of lace gloves, came to Tibet alone once again.
1:56:24|1:56:34|She knelt in the snow with her eyes closed, hands clasped together in front of her, devoutly praying to the Buddha. Despite the passing pedestrians, she was not affected at all, wholeheartedly praying for something.
1:56:35|1:56:41|On the other side, on the snow-covered grassland, several herders in Tibetan clothing discovered a baby.
1:56:41|1:56:47|The herder picked up the baby from the snow, anxiously picked up the cloth on the ground, and covered the baby's exposed legs.
1:56:47|1:56:50|The baby lay in the arms of the herder, crying loudly and pitifully.
