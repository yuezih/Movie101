0:1:6|0:1:11|At this moment, they are conducting physical training around the training ground.
0:1:57|0:2:7|On the training ground is the figure of [Liu Li], with a boyish short haircut, shouting loudly to boost her own morale while practicing moves in the air.
0:2:7|0:2:8|Yang Hui looked at [Liu Li].
0:2:8|0:2:16|Shuihu, Xiaoyue, and Yang Hui held a timer in their hands, looking smugly at Liu Li.
0:2:20|0:2:24|Yang Hui propped up her body, glanced at the timer, and said to [Liu Li].
0:2:25|0:2:29|[Liu Li] stopped practicing vigorously, looking completely exhausted.
0:2:29|0:2:34|Sweat soaked her hair as Liu Li leaned on her knees, slowly making a peace sign with her fingers.
0:3:2|0:3:5|Liu Li pulled Yang Hui and playfully pushed her down with a smile.
0:3:12|0:3:28|The shared path of life has created a deep connection between us two girls who are not quite like girls, there is a kind of emotional bond that doesn't need words to express.
0:3:28|0:3:38|We don't know what she is, but we are filled with surprise as we watch her, becoming more intense day by day.
0:4:1|0:4:4|The two hurriedly scattered a handful of banknotes.
0:4:44|0:4:46|At this moment, [Liu Li] grabbed the money and ran outside.
0:4:51|0:5:4|[Liu Li] ran all the way from the changing room to the venue, clutching those few bills in her hand. However, the glass door of the venue was locked. She pounded on the door with all her might, memories of her childhood flashing through her mind.
0:5:4|0:5:14|At that time, [Liu Li] brought Yang Hui to the doorstep. Yang Hui's mother, with a dark expression, pushed the door open and pulled Yang Hui in, then looked at the boyish [Liu Li] with disdain and said,
0:5:21|0:5:24|[Liu Li] left Yang Hui's house while making funny faces.
0:5:24|0:5:37|Yang Hui's mother then glanced at the profound Liu Li.
0:5:37|0:5:41|Yang Hui completely ignored her mother's scolding, making faces at her while going upstairs.
0:5:44|0:5:55|He pulled Yang Hui's arm, at this moment, [Liu Li] climbed onto the roof.
0:5:55|0:6:2|Yang Hui's mother finished speaking and angrily grabbed a basin to fetch hot water. Yang Hui stood on the side, feeling wronged, and looked up to see [Liu Li] practicing martial arts on the roof.
0:6:11|0:6:17|Yang Hui's mother was about to wipe her daughter's hands, only to find them covered in blood, but Yang Hui remained silent.
0:6:31|0:6:35|The mischievous [Liu Li] is still on the roof watching Yang Hui and her daughter.
0:6:35|0:6:37|When Yang Hui's mother turned around, [Liu Li] stuck out her tongue at her.
0:6:43|0:6:45|Speaking, she splashed a bucket of water at him.
0:6:45|0:6:48|At this moment, a call brought him back to reality.
0:6:49|0:6:51|Liu Li nodded absentmindedly.
0:6:51|0:6:53|The old man looked her up and down and reminded [Liu Li].
0:6:57|0:7:1|[Liu Li] took a few steps back towards the old man, with a hint of numbness in her eyes.
0:7:13|0:7:18|Suddenly, [Liu Li] remembered that she still had to call for the end of training, and ran all the way back to the training ground.
0:7:18|0:7:26|Upon returning to the team, Coach Yang Huichun carelessly asked if [Liu Li]'s mother was present. [Liu Li] firmly shook her head and secretly returned the banknote to her.
0:7:26|0:7:34|Unexpectedly, this scene was caught by the coach's sharp eyes. She fiercely hit Liu Li's hand with the stick in her hand, causing money to scatter all over the ground.
0:7:37|0:7:51|[Liu Li] reluctantly stood in place and followed everyone to start physical training. The students were seen continuously swinging the jump ropes in their hands, then immediately kicking their legs in the air to enhance their personal endurance, balance, and explosive power, sweating profusely.
0:7:51|0:7:58|[Liu Li] and Yang Hui were also among them, their expressions determined, each kick accompanied by a loud roar of anger.
0:7:58|0:8:13|Even though their hair was completely soaked with sweat, the students practiced with each other. Some used their feet, while [Liu Li] kicked one after another with all their might. By the time lunchtime arrived, [Liu Li] saw a long line at the cafeteria and managed to squeeze into a queue full of boys.
0:8:13|0:8:22|At this moment, Liu Li, the boy behind, became unhappy.
0:8:22|0:8:26|[Liu Li] was not convinced, almost raising her fist, while the young man behind her glanced at her.
0:8:32|0:8:35|[Liu Li] proudly jumps around in the line, whistling.
0:8:49|0:8:53|[Liu Li] took the tray, followed closely by Han Bing to serve the dishes.
0:8:53|0:8:56|Liu Li gave her a disdainful look and went to look for Yang Hui.
0:8:56|0:8:59|Just as Liu Li was about to enjoy his lunch, his teammate Chen Jia sat down opposite him.
0:9:27|0:9:32|I never expected the new coach Han Bing to barge into my life like this.
0:9:32|0:9:35|It seems that the unexpected is once again inevitable.
0:9:35|0:9:39|After returning to the dormitory, [Liu Li] lay down next to Yang Hui for a short rest.
0:9:39|0:9:43|Yang Hui gently stroked her head while seemingly pondering something.
0:9:43|0:9:48|Not long after, a foul smell wafted over their heads, and [Liu Li] stood up to investigate.
0:10:6|0:10:12|[Liu Li] gently brushed away the tears on Yang Hui's face as she cried, comforting her tenderly.
0:10:29|0:10:34|Yang Hui pulled out a sharp pair of scissors, leaving [Liu Li] dumbfounded. She took the scissors and looked at Yang Hui.
0:10:39|0:10:43|[Liu Li] was puzzled and gave another glance before continuing to ask.
0:10:51|0:10:57|Yang Hui played with the scissors in her hand while looking at [Liu Li], whose gaze remained fixed on the scissors.
0:10:57|0:11:0|She picked up the scissors, a childhood memory flashed through her mind.
0:11:19|0:11:25|At that time, Yang Hui's mother was singing in the house, and her beautiful singing voice attracted Liu Li.
0:11:25|0:11:34|[Liu Li] knew that Yang Hui's mother disapproved of her, so she could only hold back and sneakily lie on the opposite side of the roof, cautiously sticking her head out to steal glances.
0:11:34|0:11:38|Liu Li's mother stood gracefully at the door, her enchanting voice echoing from inside the house.
0:11:39|0:11:46|At this moment, Yang Hui is secretly holding the scissors and cutting her hair in front of the mirror, with a serious and mysterious expression.
0:11:46|0:11:58|Just as [Liu Li] was about to climb over the roof, Yang Hui's mother noticed that the scissors were missing.
0:11:58|0:12:1|In the chaos, the scissors fell to the ground, but [Liu Li]'s mother suddenly entered the room.
0:12:13|0:12:23|The tragic mother and daughter embraced tightly, with Yang Hui's mother picking up the scissors helplessly, carefully trimming Yang Hui's uneven hair, shedding tears and blaming Yang Hui at the same time.
0:12:26|0:12:31|And Yang Hui also shed tears, holding up a mirror to look at her tomboyish appearance.
0:12:31|0:12:37|The chaotic thoughts were brought back to reality, only to see the new coach, Han Bing, standing in the indoor training ground.
0:12:37|0:12:47|The training props were randomly placed by the students, with specialized foot bars and gloves on the ground, and four tires stacked very solidly, already half the height of Han Bing.
0:12:47|0:13:2|He stood there lost in thought for a moment, first lying quietly on the tire, his eyes aimlessly staring at the ceiling, then suddenly getting up and walking to another place. He casually picked up a footrest and vigorously gestured a few times towards Quanxing.
0:13:2|0:13:9|Finally, he stood in the center of the training ground, looked around, placed his hands behind his back, and walked calmly towards the outdoors.
0:13:9|0:13:12|Outside the window, thunder was rumbling, and the students were all standing on the runway.
0:14:8|0:14:13|Upon hearing this, the team of [Liu Li] and Chen Jia started to play around, gesturing for the other to go up first.
0:14:13|0:14:17|Han Bing called out to Chen Jia, and the smile on Chen Jia's face instantly froze.
0:14:23|0:14:30|Han Bing viciously kicked Chen Jia's shin, causing Chen Jia to almost fall down. Han Bing then walked away slowly.
0:14:30|0:14:34|The assistant coach has been drenched in the rain, while Han Bing continues to shout Yang Hui's first love.
0:15:2|0:15:8|In the end, Yang Hui screamed and kicked towards him, Liu Li wiped away the rain, and the next second, Yang Hui stood in the rain.
0:15:12|0:15:22|Yang Hui got up discontentedly and returned to the team, while [Liu Li] clenched her fists secretly and made a cheering gesture. However, she was pushed away by Yang Hui, and then Han Bing stood in front of [Liu Li].
0:15:25|0:15:28|Liu Li still had a look that seemed unrelated to herself.
0:15:44|0:15:50|Han Bing kicked [Liu Li] in the leg, causing [Liu Li] to stumble and fall to the ground.
0:15:57|0:16:1|[Liu Li] knelt on the ground, with an attitude that was completely at odds with Han Bing.
0:16:1|0:16:14|Unexpectedly, she then changed her posture, first crossing her legs, and then sang "Conquer" passionately, raising her head and singing loudly, even spitting on the ground, leaving Han Bing at a loss.
0:17:1|0:17:6|Han Bing's gift was unforgettable for a lifetime.
0:17:13|0:17:19|In the midst of it all, even the strongest man can't bear it.
0:17:24|0:17:27|The scene cuts to Liu Li returning to the dormitory and lying on the sofa.
0:17:27|0:17:31|Yang Hui tried to help her change out of the stone clothes, but was forcefully pulled away by [Liu Li].
0:17:59|0:18:1|[Liu Li] let out a long sigh after speaking.
0:18:1|0:18:7|At night, Yang Hui limped into the laundry room with her injured foot, only to come across Han Bing lying on the table reading a book.
0:18:7|0:18:11|Yang Hui turned and walked away as if she had seen a mortal enemy, and Han Bing turned back and glanced after hearing it.
0:18:22|0:18:33|Han Bing furrowed her brows, got up from the table neatly, and walked over to [Yang Hui] in a straightforward manner. Faced with her question about death, [Yang Hui] was momentarily speechless.
0:18:36|0:18:40|Han Bing snatched the laundry detergent from [Yang Hui]'s hand and threw it directly on the ground.
0:18:41|0:18:46|[Yang Hui] was momentarily stunned, awkwardly pursed her lips, and nervously held the hem of her clothes without daring to look directly at her.
0:18:46|0:18:51|Han Bing didn't speak, but instead took out all the clothes from the washing machine next to him.
0:18:51|0:18:55|Later, she walked up behind [Liu Li], clapped her hands, and put her hands in her pockets.
0:18:58|0:19:2|[Yang Hui] stood with his hands behind his back, looking like a guilty child.
0:19:2|0:19:5|Han gave Liu Li a cold glance before putting down the magazine.
0:19:7|0:19:9|[Yang Hui] stood in place and scratched her head.
0:19:11|0:19:15|[Yang Hui] then dragged her injured leg with all her strength to walk up to him.
0:19:15|0:19:23|Han Bing put down the magazine with a cold expression, only to see the empty space on the table being used by [Yang Hui] to prop up her feet.
0:19:26|0:19:30|Han Bing lifted her leg directly, [Yang Hui] showed no willingness and remained silent.
0:19:30|0:19:33|Just then, a dark figure appeared at the door, it was [Liu Li].
0:19:35|0:19:38|[Yang Hui] glanced at Han Bing and put down her leg.
0:19:41|0:19:45|[Yang Hui] pushed Han Bing away, flexibly moved her legs aside, and walked to the washing machine.
0:19:45|0:19:51|Han Bing's good intentions were misunderstood, she was just tidying up the books in her hands and continued speaking.
0:19:55|0:19:59|After speaking, Han Bing left the laundry room without looking back.
0:19:59|0:20:10|Standing at the door, [Liu Li] heard these words, walked into the laundry room and glared fiercely at Han Bing, secretly made a boxing gesture to vent his dissatisfaction, and muttered a few words under his breath.
0:20:10|0:20:15|Later, she walked up to [Yang Wei] with her hands in her pockets, noticing he was lost in thought, and snatched the laundry detergent from his hands.
0:20:21|0:20:26|[Liu Li] put the laundry detergent aside and the two fell silent for a moment. Unable to hold back, [Liu Li] spoke up.
0:20:28|0:20:31|[Yang Hui] put down the clothes in her hand, chuckled, and retorted.
0:20:37|0:20:39|[Liu Li] gave [Yang Hui] a glance.
0:20:41|0:20:45|In the end, [Liu Li] continued to put clothes into the washing machine, with a sense of calm and disdain in her expression.
0:20:56|0:21:0|[Liu Li] suddenly slams the washing machine shut, making a loud, heavy noise.
0:21:13|0:21:17|Liu Li gazed in silence, while Yang Hui defended herself once again.
0:21:18|0:21:21|[Liu Li] looked at her in astonishment, as if she had just heard a joke.
0:21:24|0:21:25|There was a hint of shyness in [Liu Li]'s eyes.
0:21:25|0:21:27|[Yang Hui] turned her head and smiled playfully.
0:21:55|0:22:2|The two of them finished speaking and leaned against each other, almost falling to the ground.
0:22:2|0:22:3|Han Bing remained silent after listening and continued to ask questions.
0:22:3|0:22:6|[Liu Li] was being lazy and didn't give Han Bing any face, answering listlessly.
0:22:36|0:22:40|So this level is also known as the death level.
0:22:50|0:23:1|[Liu Li] had a determined expression. The next morning, just as the day was breaking, she led the students in a devilish morning run on the main road, riding a bicycle at the front of the group while everyone followed behind her.
0:23:1|0:23:8|She urged every student to go faster, even faster. Liu Li ran at the forefront of the team to prove herself.
0:23:8|0:23:9|They crossed the pedestrian crossing.
0:23:9|0:23:13|Crossing the road, circling around and around, then running into the wild grass by the roadside.
0:23:14|0:23:19|Liu Li was sometimes at the front of the line and sometimes at the back, catching students who fell behind.
0:23:19|0:23:24|Some students have clearly been through a lot, but Liu Li still doesn't let them off the hook.
0:23:24|0:23:28|The winter morning light shone on them, but these students didn't feel any warmth.
0:23:28|0:23:33|They moved forward like puppets, with loose and disorderly movements.
0:23:33|0:23:39|My ghostly training is hard for everyone to bear, but everyone is holding on and moving forward.
0:23:39|0:23:42|[Liu Li] looked pale at this moment, with her teammates trying to talk to her on the side.
0:23:50|0:23:56|The Birdman sat down by the roadside, panting heavily, when Yang Hui ran back and desperately grabbed Liu Li.
0:24:56|0:25:2|For three consecutive days, a marathon each day, the cold ice is pushing me like a devil.
0:25:31|0:25:37|Whenever [Liu Li] is too tired to go on, Han Bing will carry the bicycle and try to ride over her.
0:25:37|0:25:40|[Liu Li] had to obediently eat and continue running.
0:25:40|0:25:47|It was a cold winter day in the thirteenth month. [Liu Li] was wearing a down vest, while Han Bing was only wearing a thin hoodie.
0:25:47|0:25:52|[Liu Li] kept hearing Han Bing's voice in her ear, urging her to get up and continue.
0:25:52|0:25:59|Whenever [Liu Li] collapses on the grass with a heartless expression, Han Bing will find ways to help her up, looking frustrated at her lack of progress.
0:26:0|0:26:19|Sometimes even Han Bing himself is exhausted and falls down with [Liu Li], but he still manages to pull [Liu Li] up, determined to crawl to the finish line.
0:26:19|0:26:25|Han Bing was furious, while [Liu Li] was lying on the grass at this moment, using the weak force brought by the support of both elbows to move forward.
0:26:31|0:26:37|[Liu Li] gritted her teeth, tearing at the grass with her hands, blood from the wounds on her hands leaving a trail as she crawled, her face contorted in a fierce grimace as she let out a howl.
0:26:48|0:26:53|At this moment, [Liu Li] couldn't tell if it was sweat or tears, feeling like there were always droplets on his face.
0:26:53|0:26:59|One step, two steps, three steps, Han Bing showed no intention of stopping him, just telling him that this was the last twenty meters.
0:27:10|0:27:17|Liu Li climbed up with a furrowed brow, maintaining the original posture, and completed the final 20 meters with the last bit of strength.
0:27:17|0:27:25|Later, he buried his head in the grass, completely unable to get up, his hands leaving bloodstains from long-term friction with the ground.
0:27:25|0:27:29|Han Bing stood behind him, letting him vent freely, but it was of no use.
0:27:31|0:27:35|[Liu Li] is exhausted, so tired that even breathing is difficult.
0:27:35|0:27:37|Finally, the training is over, and she returns to the dormitory.
0:27:50|0:27:54|The angry roar silenced everyone. [Liu Li]
0:27:54|0:27:58|He walked under the shower head, turned on the tap, and took a shower without even taking off his clothes.
0:27:58|0:28:2|A stream of water lay on Liu Li, swallowing the last warmth of the body.
0:28:13|0:28:20|At this moment, Yang Hui was casually drying her hair, showing no concern at all, without a hint of comforting Liu Li.
0:28:20|0:28:27|Liu Li's face is covered with weeds and scars, she throws the headband on the ground.
0:28:52|0:28:55|[Liu Li] shook her head with her hands on her head, making a heavy compromise.
0:29:1|0:29:4|Yang Hui ignored [Liu Li] and let her hammer the gun with her fists.
0:29:11|0:29:15|Liu Li flashes back to the scene of practicing fencing in his childhood.
0:29:15|0:29:25|It was a cold winter day, the ground covered in ice. [Liu Li] and Yang Hui's cheeks were frozen pale, both wearing ice skates and holding slender bamboo poles.
0:29:25|0:29:29|The old man with a forked beard in front used a flowing sword technique, catching Liu Li off guard.
0:29:29|0:29:34|This is Liu Li's grandfather, Yang Hui blocked left and right, but he accidentally found a loophole.
0:29:35|0:29:51|Grandpa made a swift and mocking move, taking quick steps to press [Liu Li] and Yang Hui. His swordsmanship was light as a butterfly's dance, fast as the wind's strike. [Liu Li] thrust towards him with all her might, but Grandpa dodged, causing her to miss and fall hard to the ground.
0:29:59|0:30:6|Lost in thought, [Liu Li] walks aimlessly on the training ground, looking burdened and deep in contemplation.
0:30:6|0:30:16|Strangely, after extreme fatigue and angry outbursts, there gradually arose a sense of self-conquest.
0:30:20|0:30:32|As time passed, [Liu Li] and Yang Hui gradually got used to the harsh training like ice-cold devil, repeating high-intensity physical training every day, rolling tires to kick legs, pulling tires, shouting exercises, etc.
0:30:32|0:30:37|To enhance explosiveness on the field, vocal training is essential for [Liu Li].
0:30:37|0:30:40|They have had thoughts of giving up more than once, but they have also persisted.
0:31:34|0:31:43|The tears of the two rolled in their eyes, and after suddenly being stopped, they fell to the ground and simply didn't get up.
0:31:54|0:32:6|It is often just a casual glance or a few words that fill their hearts with warmth, giving them the courage to face the next challenge.
0:32:7|0:32:11|[Liu Li] collapsed on Yang Hui's stomach, both too exhausted to get up.
0:32:11|0:32:15|At this moment, Liu Li is waiting for the assistant coach at another training ground.
0:32:15|0:32:19|She practices triple jump and hurdles while holding a stopwatch in her hand.
0:32:19|0:32:22|Even though she is on the training ground, her worries are elsewhere.
0:32:22|0:32:25|Just then, the assistant coach walked over.
0:32:45|0:32:53|The key is for the athlete to be fully focused, to adjust themselves in a short period of time, and to accept the challenge.
0:33:36|0:33:39|[Liu Li] couldn't eat, so she spit out the bread from her mouth.
0:34:15|0:34:25|[Liu Li] picked up a bucket of bottled mineral water and chugged it down vigorously, spinning a few times while drinking. After belching contentedly, Yang Hui was still not satisfied.
0:34:34|0:34:40|[Liu Li] compromised helplessly, gulping down another bottle of mineral water, spilling it all over the floor.
0:35:17|0:35:22|[Liu Li] was bouncing happily, and Yang Hui urged [Liu Li] to eat more for the competition.
0:35:22|0:35:31|However, in the equipment room on the other side, Han Bing was lying on a chair sleeping. She didn't know when she fell asleep, nor how long she had been sleeping.
0:35:31|0:35:51|At this time, there are still students training outside the equipment room. The students are enthusiastic in their training, but the shouting wakes up Liu Li. Liu Li struggles to get up, her tired face showing signs of fatigue. It seems that this place has not been cleaned for a long time, with leftover takeout boxes, training equipment, and computers scattered around.
0:35:51|0:35:57|She picked up the cup and drank all the water in one gulp, then put her hands in her pockets. After a moment of daze, she prepared to train the students.
0:35:58|0:36:5|In order to improve the practical combat skills of Taekwondo, sparring is often included in the training of Taekwondo athletes.
0:36:5|0:36:9|The most classic and brutal practice is when a man accompanies a woman in training.
0:36:9|0:36:16|Due to the inherent physical disadvantage and the fact that she is physically weaker than the boys, [Liu Li] and Yang Hui were beaten badly by a group of boys.
0:36:18|0:36:25|Liu Li first failed to control the distance properly, quickly got silenced, and then his leg movements were too slow to retract, getting caught and blocked without striking.
0:36:25|0:36:29|The lightweight male student Liu Li is fast, while the heavyweight male student is strong.
0:36:29|0:36:31|[Liu Li] and Yang Hui are clearly not their match.
0:36:31|0:36:36|However, there is no room for surrender in Han Bing's world, and she must persevere and train hard.
0:36:36|0:36:44|The students swiftly kicked and retracted their legs amidst shouts, with [Liu Li] and Yang Hui facing attacks from all directions.
0:36:44|0:36:53|At this moment, Han Bing stood on the side, using his foot to supervise other students practicing kicks. Even though they were all wearing protective gear, Liu Li and Yang Hui were still beaten black and blue.
0:36:53|0:37:2|Due to exhaustion, a beginner's high side kick knocked them both down. [Liu Li] crossed his arms to protect his head, but he still got kicked in the end.
0:37:2|0:37:9|The moment the head makes contact with the ground, there is a strong vibration, followed by a huge kinetic energy pulling the body rolling on the ground.
0:37:9|0:37:14|At this moment, before [Han Bing] harshly trained them and asked them to continue training, Liu Li had not yet done so.
0:37:32|0:37:35|[Han Bing] angrily stomped his foot on the ground and slammed it heavily.
0:37:42|0:37:47|[Han Bing] gave [Yang Hui] a hard knock on the head, and the surrounding students dared not speak.
0:37:47|0:37:49|[Yang Hui] faced the ground, starting to gasp.
0:37:49|0:37:54|[Han Bing] flashed a hint of pity in his expression, but still told the students around him to go back to training.
0:37:54|0:37:57|She got up without considering the two of them and left with just one sentence.
0:38:2|0:38:8|[Han Bing]'s words obviously didn't work, [Liu Li] and [Yang Hui] are still lying on the ground, holding hands across the distance.
0:38:8|0:38:11|Training with a man is a very cruel practice for a woman.
0:38:13|0:38:17|Liu Li looked down and saw that Yang Hui's feet were oozing a large amount of fresh blood.
0:38:17|0:38:20|She hurriedly rummaged through the wardrobe, angrily accusing [Liu Li].
0:38:52|0:38:57|[Liu Li] changed her clothes and ran towards the training ground, completely ignoring the injured Yang Hui.
0:38:57|0:39:5|After leaving the training ground, she fell hard, not caring about dusting herself off, because now she had to go smash Hanbing's bicycle.
0:39:5|0:39:8|[Liu Li] first threw the bicycle against the iron pillar and stomped on it a few times.
0:39:8|0:39:12|Yang Hui, who was rushed over by Wen Sheng, hopped over with a limp, and hurriedly stopped [Liu Li].
0:39:39|0:39:45|With a smile on her face, [Liu Li] led Yang Hui to the medical room.
0:40:25|0:40:27|He said.
0:40:31|0:40:35|The scene shifts, Han Bing is walking and chatting with the assistant coach.
0:41:16|0:41:23|On one side, the two exchanged smiles, while on the other side, Yang Hui and [Liu Li] were in the room, with [Liu Li] continuously pouring water from a bucket into her mouth.
0:41:53|0:41:58|[Liu Li] squatted down, rolled up Yang Hui's pants leg, carefully examined her wound, and asked.
0:42:0|0:42:3|Yang Hui shook his head awkwardly, with a somewhat dim gaze.
0:42:3|0:42:10|In the brutal training, even if one is careful to avoid, it is hard to escape the pain.
0:42:10|0:42:14|Besides, does Yang Hui, who seems so dull, really not feel any pain?
0:42:34|0:42:39|Between the windows, the horse passes by, the pig flows coins, and in the blink of an eye, the day of the competition is approaching.
0:42:39|0:42:45|[Liu Li], Yang Hui, and Han Bing flew through the clouds, but there was no excitement on their faces, only deep concern.
0:42:46|0:42:59|[Liu Li] and Yang Hui stared out of the window in a daze, while Han Bing flipped through the magazine in her hands.
0:42:59|0:43:10|Seagulls fly over the Wangyang Waterfall, as Liu Li and Yang Hui travel to Vancouver to bring glory to their country. This time they must win, and in the blink of an eye, they arrive at the competition venue.
0:43:16|0:43:21|The best player of the Chinese team participated in the World Taekwondo Championships held in Edmonton, Canada.
0:43:21|0:43:25|Chinese female athlete [Liu Li] and Yang Hui are the female team members with the best chance of winning the championship.
0:43:25|0:43:29|This is their scene in the competition.
0:43:29|0:43:35|Yang Hui used the horizontal stroke technique to hit the valid scoring area of American athlete Jesse Ba, gaining the lead in the first day of the competition.
0:43:37|0:43:42|Everyone cheered for the exciting outcome, and they were having a meal together in the restaurant where they lived.
0:43:50|0:43:57|[Liu Li] was stunned when she heard this, she turned to look at the uninvited guests behind her, realizing that a tough battle was about to begin.
0:43:57|0:44:6|She turned around, her face serious, and led Yang Hui to the control room.
0:44:7|0:44:10|Yang Hui dragged her injured leg and walked out.
0:44:25|0:44:30|Han Bin rolled up his pants, the wound glaringly exposed to the air.
0:44:30|0:44:33|Shortly after, Han Bin immediately took Yang Hui to the hospital for a check-up.
0:44:33|0:44:36|The doctor's words were undoubtedly a bolt from the blue for [Liu Li].
0:44:37|0:44:39|Her condition is medically known as depersonalization.
0:44:41|0:44:46|If he cannot regain his self-defense ability, he will miss the opportunity with Taekwondo.
0:44:46|0:44:51|Liu Li, who learned of the outcome, was at a loss, with his previous fierce and menacing demeanor completely gone.
0:44:51|0:44:59|[Liu Li] was downstairs and heard this conversation. It was as if her soul had been sucked out. Even when a doctor passed by and greeted her, she didn't react.
0:44:59|0:45:3|Shortly after, Han Bing quickly found the assistant coach to discuss countermeasures.
0:45:18|0:45:23|Fate has been too cruel to [Liu Li].
0:45:23|0:45:28|Just on the eve of the final battle, [Liu Li] lost the chance to advance.
0:45:33|0:45:36|For an athlete,
0:45:40|0:45:45|Yang Hui, however, seemed to be in a world of her own, determined to succeed.
0:45:45|0:45:48|In the hospital room, [Liu Li] is tidying up Yang Hui's hair.
0:46:3|0:46:9|[Liu Li] knew the seriousness of Yang Hui's illness. She took a step back and sat down, starting to educate others.
0:46:40|0:46:44|In Liu Li's mind, scenes of her childhood when she and Yang Hui became martial arts disciples flashed by.
0:46:47|0:46:49|Grandpa Liu Li held [Yang Hui]'s hand and asked.
0:46:52|0:46:55|At this moment, [Liu Li]'s mother appeared and pulled [Liu Li] aside.
0:47:44|0:47:48|[Yang Hui]'s mother couldn't believe it, she had been misunderstanding all along.
0:47:48|0:47:52|[Yang Hui] pushed the wheelchair and called out to the depressed Liu Li.
0:47:53|0:47:56|Liu Li came to her senses and wiped away the tears from the corner of her eyes.
0:47:56|0:47:59|Seeing her absent-minded look, [Liu Li] confidently comforted her.
0:48:17|0:48:22|Liu Li knew it well, but she still stopped in her tracks and angrily pounded the railing with her fist.
0:48:33|0:48:37|[Yang Hui] was angered by these words, pushing her wheelchair and stopping from walking out.
0:49:14|0:49:18|[Liu Li] couldn't resist him, and the just calmed emotions were ignited into anger again.
0:49:18|0:49:23|She hesitated, lightly patting [Yang Hui]'s shoulder, took a deep breath, and continued to push forward.
0:49:38|0:49:44|Yang Hui spoke while leaning on the railing, trying to find a fulcrum to stand on.
0:49:44|0:49:49|[Liu Li] forcefully pushes her down onto the wheelchair and shouts angrily at her.
0:49:49|0:49:54|On the other side, the coaches decided whether Yang Hui would participate in the competition by flipping a coin.
0:49:54|0:49:56|The room was filled with silence.
0:50:18|0:50:23|Obviously, Yang Hui will definitely participate in this competition, Han Bing is very conflicted, scratching his head in frustration.
0:50:23|0:50:28|Suddenly, the phone rang. Startled, [Liu Li] glanced at it and quickly got up to answer it.
0:50:47|0:50:59|Facing Yang Hui's resolute request to participate, it is unknown whether the superior leaders also softened their stance, deciding to allow her to compete and giving the athlete one final chance.
0:51:1|0:51:17|At this moment, [Liu Li] is helping Yang Hui change the gauze, but the wound shows no signs of improvement.
0:51:32|0:51:37|Yang Hui was stunned, staring straight at [Liu Li].
0:51:37|0:51:43|[Liu Li] lifted her head and met Yang Hui's eyes, her gaze like a hidden blade that made people dare not look directly at her.
0:51:43|0:51:48|The usually bold Liu Li also admitted defeat this time, and then she stood up after calming down a bit.
0:51:56|0:52:0|[Liu Li] did not get angry and continued to help her organize her clothes.
0:52:0|0:52:2|The two of them faced each other in silence.
0:52:2|0:52:6|Yang Hui pursed her lips, glaring at [Liu Li] with a murderous look in her eyes.
0:52:14|0:52:22|After speaking, [Liu Li] stood still and turned towards the washstand, supporting the table with both hands, pondering why [Yang Hui] was ungrateful, as if she had a deep-seated hatred towards her.
0:52:59|0:53:2|[Liu Li] rolled her eyes as Han Bing walked up to her with hands on hips.
0:53:36|0:53:45|The tense atmosphere between the two escalated, as Han Bing was about to drag her to the door, [Liu Li] pushed him away.
0:53:45|0:53:50|[Liu Li] pointed to the door, shaking her head as she spoke.
0:53:50|0:53:54|Han Bing and [Liu Li] no longer face each other directly, but instead move around to her back to listen to her speak.
0:54:11|0:54:16|With a scream from [Liu Li], Han Bing's hand landed on her face, delivering a hard slap.
0:54:16|0:54:20|Han Bing hesitated for a few seconds, still not realizing what she had just done.
0:54:20|0:54:23|Then, [Liu Li] was gently urged to go on stage.
0:54:23|0:54:27|[Liu Li] covered her face in shock for a moment, she didn't expect to be slapped.
0:54:27|0:54:31|Perhaps both of them were so angry that their words were beyond her control.
0:54:33|0:54:44|He couldn't bear this kind of grievance, slammed the door heavily, covered his face and ran to the bathroom, sitting alone on a chair, holding his head in his hands, tears streaming down his face. After calming down, he also figured it out.
0:55:22|0:55:31|The final begins, and the audience below is already boiling with excitement, not only because this is an international competition, but also because the contestant on stage is a teammate who has been together day and night.
0:55:32|0:55:36|The thrilling scene is indeed rare, and it's really tough on [Liu Li].
0:55:36|0:55:44|In her mind, scenes of the two of them fighting each other, superhuman leg bows, spinning back kicks, etc., kept playing back and forth like a movie.
0:55:44|0:55:50|Thinking of this, [Liu Li] leaned dejectedly against the wall, but in fact, the competition was right in front of her.
0:55:50|0:55:57|The scene shifts, Yang Hui slowly walks to the center of the arena, bowing deeply to the audience and referees, while Liu Li is still hesitating to enter the court in the back.
0:55:58|0:56:8|After putting on the helmet, [Liu Li] took a deep breath, her steps slow and deliberate. Meanwhile, Han Bing waited at the coach's seat, looking at the hand she had just hit [Liu Li] with, feeling both helpless and guilty.
0:56:8|0:56:10|As soon as [Liu Li] appeared, the voiceover commentary could be heard.
0:56:10|0:56:11|[Liu Li], wearing red armor, is her teammate Yang Hui.
0:56:38|0:56:42|And at that moment, Grandpa and Yang Hui's mother were also watching the live TV broadcast.
0:56:42|0:56:51|The announcer on the TV announced the news of Yang Hui's illness. Upon hearing this, Yang Hui's mother did not show surprise or shock, but quietly wiped away a tear.
0:56:51|0:56:56|The two sat around the fireplace in silence, their faces filled with pride and satisfaction for what they had accomplished.
0:56:59|0:57:3|The scene shifts to the competition venue, where the battle becomes more intense.
0:57:3|0:57:20|Yang Hui and [Liu Li] are evenly matched, with Han Bing pacing back and forth offstage, appearing very anxious and worried.
0:57:41|0:57:52|A few days after the race, the rain had stopped and the sun was shining. [Liu Li] hurriedly walked with her suitcase, paying no attention to the shadow beneath her feet. Han Bing rode up on a bike and called out to her.
0:57:54|0:57:58|[Liu Li] kept walking forward, while Han Bing threw the car and grabbed her.
0:58:29|0:58:37|Han Bing didn't answer, she just stared at [Liu Li] for a while, then patted [Liu Li]'s shoulder, like an older brother to a younger sister.
0:58:37|0:58:45|Out of guilt, Han Bing picked up Liu Li's luggage, dragged it in front of her with both hands, and gestured for her to go back first.
0:58:45|0:58:50|[Liu Li] took the luggage, sighed, and coldly rejected Han Bing's kindness.
0:59:7|0:59:10|Han Bing pointed in the direction of the exit, leaving [Liu Li] speechless with anger.
0:59:12|0:59:17|Han Bing, with a stern face, scolded again. [Liu Li] glared at him, grabbed the suitcase and left.
0:59:17|0:59:23|Who knew, on the rainy road full of potholes, [Liu Li] walked a distance and her suitcase tripped and fell to the ground.
0:59:23|0:59:28|She decisively kicked out, venting her anger on the icy back, and condemned angrily.
0:59:30|0:59:34|Say it, [Liu Li] dragged the suitcase and left without looking back.
0:59:34|0:59:37|Han Bing looked indifferent, leaving [Liu Li] behind without a word.
0:59:37|0:59:41|[Liu Li] walked angrily to the front gate and hailed a taxi.
0:59:41|0:59:46|As the driver helped her with the luggage, she realized how deep her connection with taekwondo was.
0:59:47|0:59:52|But since she had made up her mind to leave, [Liu Li] just turned back and looked at the school for a long time.
0:59:52|0:59:56|Despite the loneliness and reluctance in her heart, [Liu Li] still got on the car.
0:59:56|1:0:5|But who could have expected that, just as the car started to drive away, Han Bing suddenly ran out, chasing after the car and shouting for her to stay.
1:0:5|1:0:9|Some time later, one day, a magazine cover featuring [Liu Li] as a model appeared on the table.
1:0:14|1:0:17|The character [Liu Li] in the photo is dressed sexy and striking a seductive pose.
1:0:17|1:0:22|Han Bing took a glance, his mouth twisted in anger.
1:0:46|1:0:54|After Han Bing bid a respectful farewell, the assistant coach hung up the phone. Han Bing walked to the window, sighed heavily, and muttered to himself.
1:1:0|1:1:10|The next day, the streets were filled with posters of Liu Li, who was heavily made up with trendy hair and avant-garde makeup, showing no signs of sweating on the competition field.
1:1:10|1:1:16|Han Bing stared at the poster of [Liu Li] and waved his headscarf, as if waiting for something, but at this moment, [Liu Li] was shining brightly.
1:1:17|1:1:27|[Liu Li] walked on the stage with a bold and assertive demeanor, dressed in a very eye-catching gown. Every move she made followed the melody of the accompaniment, eliciting cheers from the audience below the stage.
1:1:27|1:1:39|Just before the performance ended, [Liu Li] still gave all the audience a charming look and smile. Without finding [Liu Li], [Han Bing] returned to the office dejected, not knowing what to do, with a restless mood rushing to her head.
1:1:39|1:1:43|She swept away the scattered pieces of paper and walked to the window, deep in thought.
1:1:43|1:1:54|At the same time, after the performance, [Liu Li] returned home and looked at the glamorous reflection of herself in the mirror. She took out a camera and proudly imagined herself shining brightly.
1:2:29|1:2:41|At the same time, [Liu Li], feeling frustrated, started drinking alone, downing glass after glass of baijiu.
1:2:41|1:2:45|Her nostrils twitched slightly, as if tears were about to fall in the next second.
1:2:45|1:2:50|The intense burning sensation of alcohol made her uncomfortable, and she suddenly started coughing violently.
1:2:50|1:2:52|The scene shifts, [Han Bing] arrives at the home of [Liu Li].
1:2:53|1:3:0|The house decoration is full of ambiguous atmosphere, with an artist poster on the wall and an old-fashioned movie projector in the corner.
1:3:0|1:3:9|Han Ming discovered a taekwondo uniform hanging in the wardrobe, which used to be the most frequently worn clothing by [Liu Li], now neatly hung up and cleaned.
1:3:9|1:3:18|But because it hasn't been touched for a long time and has gathered dust, [Liu Li] has just put on a stylish jacket, paired with tight jeans and boots, she can be described as a desert girl, which is not an exaggeration.
1:3:19|1:3:29|He walked out of the bathroom with his hands in his pockets, until he saw Han Bing, he froze, the coach he hadn't seen for a long time now seemed very unfamiliar.
1:3:29|1:3:31|[Liu Li] steps forward and speaks first.
1:3:31|1:3:36|Han Bing slowly turned around and looked [Liu Li] up and down.
1:3:36|1:3:40|[Liu Li] squeezed out a smile, but the next second her mouth drooped down and she shook her head.
1:3:44|1:3:48|As soon as the words fell, [Liu Li] froze, the two facing each other in silence.
1:3:48|1:3:54|Han Bing lowered her head slightly, [Liu Li] turned around, no longer discussing this topic with him.
1:4:0|1:4:5|[Liu Li] looked at him coldly, then turned away without answering, displaying her emotions very well.
1:4:12|1:4:19|Liu Li gazed at Han Bing's departing figure for a long time, leaving only herself in the room, feeling lonely and desolate.
1:4:19|1:4:22|The scene shifts, and [Liu Li] almost falls to the ground as a maid.
1:4:22|1:4:27|At this moment, [Liu Li] is practicing, but due to the injury, she can't even walk normally.
1:4:27|1:4:34|Sitting alone at home, [Liu Li] is surrounded by her own model posters. Even though she looks glamorous on the posters, she can't bring herself to be happy.
1:4:37|1:4:46|[Yang Hui] tried her best to find a suitable fulcrum by using her injured leg, but almost stumbled every time she tried. Her balance was unstable as soon as she lifted her leg.
1:4:46|1:4:55|The intense and unbearable pain made her look fierce and fragile, as she tried to throw punches like before, imagining the opponent right in front of her but to no avail.
1:4:55|1:5:5|Nostalgic [Liu Li] tried to call [Yang Hui] but couldn't get through. Feeling down, [Liu Li] tossed the phone aside and lay alone in a pile of posters.
1:5:7|1:5:19|Memories of childhood flashed through Liu Li's mind.
1:5:19|1:5:24|Yang Hui's mother walked down the steps, while Yang Hui and [Liu Li] were playing enthusiastically.
1:5:31|1:5:40|[Liu Li] and [Yang Hui] were chasing each other, running up the narrow stone steps. In order to prevent [Yang Hui] from getting the egg, [Liu Li] did a handstand directly, sticking tightly to the wall.
1:5:40|1:5:43|[Yang Hui] gasped for breath and sat down heavily on the ground.
1:5:48|1:5:58|Yang Hui glanced at [Liu Li], then picked up her arrow and tapped it three times, looking it up and down with a disdainful expression. She then threw it on the ground and walked away.
1:6:4|1:6:9|Thoughts returned to reality, with a vast expanse of white at the boundary between heaven and earth on the frozen ground before the eyes.
1:6:9|1:6:14|On the vast and endless road, a white sedan zoomed by, with [Liu Li] sitting in the driver's seat.
1:6:14|1:6:18|At this moment, [Liu Li] was driving hurriedly towards the training ground.
1:6:18|1:6:26|On the other side, Liu Li was running in the snow, wearing a thick down jacket that made each step look very heavy, making her particularly conspicuous in the snow.
1:6:26|1:6:31|[Liu Li] drove to the parking lot, turned the steering wheel all the way, skillfully made a turn, and then parked the car.
1:6:32|1:6:38|He wore a pair of sunglasses, wrapped in a high-end scarf, dressed in jeans and leather boots, looking very capable.
1:6:38|1:6:44|[Liu Li] gets off the car and strides towards the snowy field, with only his figure in the vast land.
1:6:44|1:6:53|As Yang Hui crossed over the hill, Liu Li continued to sprint forward, her long ponytail swaying back and forth, unaware of where her destination was.
1:6:53|1:7:2|In contrast, [Liu Li] is much more straightforward. It wasn't until [Liu Li] walked to the center of the hill that she saw Yang Hui running in the snow. After a moment of thought, she lowered her head.
1:7:4|1:7:10|Liu Li didn't call out to [Yang Hui], but stood still, gazing steadfastly into the distance.
1:7:10|1:7:16|The earth was covered in silver-white, pure snow, and the thick ice made people feel bone-chilling cold.
1:7:16|1:7:20|At this moment, [Liu Li] was a bit tired, she stopped and gasped for breath.
1:7:20|1:7:27|Turning around, she locked eyes with [Liu Li], and childhood memories flashed through her mind like a revolving lantern once again.
1:7:30|1:7:47|Remember when they were playing together with their friends when they were young, on a snowy winter day. [Yang Hui] was carrying a basket of eggs, chasing and playing around, accidentally slipping and falling, breaking the eggs on the ground. The other friends picked up the eggs from the ground and threw them at each other, but only [Liu Li] bent down, patiently helping her pick up the eggs.
1:7:48|1:7:52|[Yang Hui]'s hand was scraped badly when she fell, and there was blood all over when she raised her hand.
1:8:3|1:8:8|No matter how hard Liu Li tried, all he got was the back view of [Yang Hui] walking away gracefully.
1:8:9|1:8:12|Childhood memories flashed before [Liu Li]'s eyes.
1:8:15|1:8:21|The scene shifts, Han Bing appears in Grandpa Liu Li's house.
1:8:21|1:8:29|Han Bing stood at the door for a long time, looking inside at the old furnishings. She pushed open the door, still with her hands in her pockets.
1:8:29|1:8:35|Han Bing walked into the room, where Liu Li's grandfather was practicing calligraphy. Han Bing took a few steps forward.
1:8:44|1:8:51|Han Bing pondered for a moment, her eyes wandering as she glanced at the furnishings and calligraphy on the bookshelf, then slowly walked over to Grandpa [Liu Li].
1:8:51|1:8:55|Grandpa Liu Li put down the brush in his hand, waiting for him to speak.
1:8:55|1:8:58|Han Bing picked up the Go pieces on the table while talking.
1:9:14|1:9:19|Han Bing's eyes were calm like an ancient well, and after Grandpa Liu Li finished speaking, he walked away to somewhere else.
1:9:19|1:9:31|They were members of the geological team. When they were conducting a survey on the snow-capped mountains, they encountered an avalanche shortly after arriving in Shangri-La. When they left, Liu Li was only five years old, Liu Li.
1:9:47|1:9:50|The scene shifts to the stage where models are walking the runway.
1:9:50|1:9:53|The dazzling stage lights cast a floral shadow on the ground.
1:9:53|1:9:58|Models wearing extravagant gowns showcase themselves in the center of the stage.
1:9:58|1:10:2|[Liu Li]'s face has distinct contours, which appear even more captivating under the strong light.
1:10:43|1:10:48|In pouring rain, [Liu Li] rushed towards the company without even carrying an umbrella.
1:10:48|1:10:57|Finally, she stopped and saw Grandpa wearing a raincoat, with a few drops of water on his white beard. He held an umbrella in his hand, but didn't open it, standing alone in the rain.
1:10:57|1:11:2|[Liu Li] quickly followed her grandfather when she saw him, without any of the arrogance and domineering attitude she displayed on stage.
1:11:18|1:11:22|Liu Li's cheeks had two clear tear marks, and she trembled as she answered.
1:11:22|1:11:28|[Liu Li] sat cross-legged in front of her grandfather, tremblingly called out "Grandpa", recalling the teachings her grandfather gave to herself and Yang Hui back then.
1:11:54|1:11:57|Liu Li's eyes revealed stubbornness as she looked up and said.
1:12:29|1:12:31|Grandpa hurriedly walked away.
1:12:31|1:12:38|Time has passed, [Liu Li] stands on the ice rink where she used to practice martial arts, surrounded by a group of children holding swords and sparring with each other.
1:12:38|1:12:43|At this moment, Yang Hui, braving the winter cold wind, limped towards [Liu Li] with a limp.
1:12:43|1:12:45|[Liu Li] turned away, unwilling to face it directly.
1:12:59|1:13:7|Liu Li could not argue back, as if the world had suddenly gone silent.
1:13:7|1:13:10|Yang Hui walked up behind him and let out a loud roar.
1:13:14|1:13:22|Yang Hui suddenly rushed to Liu Li, snatched the sword and luggage from her hands. Due to the vast difference in size, Liu Li was pushed to the ground during the struggle.
1:13:22|1:13:27|Yang Hui took Liu Li's luggage and left, leaving Liu Li standing alone in a daze.
1:13:27|1:13:33|Liu Li's coat collar was blown open by the cold wind, with a few pieces of partially melted snow still sticking to her body.
1:13:33|1:13:38|She stood still in a daze, and a little boy walked up to her, about the same age as Liu Li back then.
1:13:42|1:13:46|At this moment, Yang Hui is walking towards Grandpa Liu Li's tombstone.
1:14:49|1:14:52|[Liu Li] was pushed to the ground, his bangs scattered casually in front of his eyes.
1:15:1|1:15:4|[Liu Li] looked extremely pained as he helped [Yang Hui] up, his body trembling slightly.
1:15:4|1:15:15|She leaned Yang Hui's head against her chest and comforted her softly.
1:15:15|1:15:18|The two cuddled together, with [Liu Li] gently stroking [Yang Hui]'s head.
1:15:18|1:15:22|Arriving home late, [Yang Hui] seemed to have caught a cold, shivering all over with a high fever that wouldn't go away.
1:15:22|1:15:23|[Liu Li] prepares the towel.
1:15:26|1:15:29|[Yang Hui] had a pale face and could hardly speak.
1:15:29|1:15:34|After taking the towel, [Liu Li] took off her scarf and put it on her, clasping her hands tightly together.
1:15:34|1:15:39|[Liu Li] looked at her with a worried expression, suddenly, [Yang Hui] grabbed [Liu Li].
1:15:42|1:15:45|[Yang Hui] looked desperate, with two tears streaming down her face.
1:15:49|1:15:52|His gaze shifted to [Liu Li], as if there was more to his words than met the eye.
1:15:55|1:15:57|[Liu Li] looked ahead with a determined gaze mixed with tears.
1:16:0|1:16:5|[Liu Li] turned her head, paused, and what she said next was even more unexpected.
1:16:14|1:16:20|Yang Hui couldn't hold back anymore when she heard this, tightly holding Liu Li's hand and starting to sob.
1:16:20|1:16:25|[Liu Li] puts her hand to her ear and the two of them lean in close, snuggling up to each other.
1:16:25|1:16:30|The next day, [Liu Li] really pushed Yang Hui to the training ground that she was once so familiar with.
1:16:30|1:16:34|The other students are younger, just like they were back in the day.
1:16:34|1:16:37|And at this moment, Han Bing stood on the training ground, watching them train.
1:16:38|1:16:43|Amidst the repeated shouts, that familiar yet unfamiliar feeling surged in the heart.
1:16:43|1:16:48|Liu Li slowly approached, and Han Bing happened to turn around, seeing the figures of Liu Li and Yang Hui.
1:16:48|1:16:54|Her expression did not show a hint of surprise or astonishment, as if it was expected.
1:16:54|1:16:58|However, she immediately turned around, pretending not to see, and continued training.
1:16:58|1:17:3|Liu Li stood behind her, ran to the stage and stared straight at her back.
1:17:3|1:17:7|Han Bing seemed to be still focused on training the students, so [Liu Li] stopped her.
1:17:10|1:17:14|Han Bing turned around and glanced back, expressionless and indifferent.
1:17:14|1:17:19|Yang Hui sat alone in a wheelchair, watching Han Bing and [Liu Li] talking not far away.
1:17:19|1:17:25|Later, Han Bing walked up to [Liu Li] and then circled around, looking her up and down.
1:17:25|1:17:34|[Liu Li] responded with a determined expression, but still appeared nonchalant and evenly matched.
1:17:34|1:17:37|Han Bing's question left [Liu Li] speechless and embarrassed.
1:17:37|1:17:39|She avoids Han Bing's words, her eyes cast down.
1:18:23|1:18:24|Vaguely.
1:18:28|1:18:37|In the next scene, on the training ground, Yang Hui is sitting in a wheelchair, while [Liu Li] is shouting instructions, conducting physical recovery training.
1:18:37|1:18:45|[Liu Li] has a dumbbell on top of her head, with one piece on each side. She exerts all her strength to lift it up for the last time, and then throws it into another training exercise.
1:18:46|1:18:54|[Liu Li] holds the dumbbell plate, rapidly rotating her body from side to side, sweating profusely as she utilizes the power of her core and abdominal muscles.
1:18:54|1:18:59|She then wrapped bandages around her feet, ran to the other side of the training ground, and began her kicking training. [Liu Li]
1:18:59|1:19:1|Yang Hui was spinning rapidly behind her.
1:19:16|1:19:21|[Liu Li] exhaustedly tried to stand up, but due to unstable balance, almost fell down.
1:19:24|1:19:31|[Liu Li] threw the dumbbell aside, panting heavily, and the dumbbell rolled freely on the ground due to inertia.
1:19:31|1:19:34|The next day, Han Bing led her and the trainees to train together.
1:19:41|1:19:45|1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. The students marched in perfect unison, with Liu Li at the center, forming a circle.
1:19:45|1:19:49|[Liu Li] is also among them, with a headband tied around her head.
1:19:49|1:19:52|When passing by Han Bing, the two looked at each other but remained silent.
1:19:52|1:19:57|Finally, Han Bing walked to the corner, holding a list in his hand, and called Liu Li over.
1:20:7|1:20:30|[Liu Li], a diligent and righteous worker, was about to leave when he turned back and said a few words. Suddenly, I felt guilty towards Han Bin. For the arrival of this day, he had put in so much effort and endured much more pressure than us. When he trained with us day in and day out with a disabled body.
1:20:42|1:20:51|On the day of the Olympic Games opening ceremony, the ten thousand athletes arrived in the blink of an eye. The glorious moment finally arrived, stirring the hearts of 1.3 billion people of all ages.
1:20:51|1:21:8|The grand opening ceremony is underway, with birds in the stadium cheering and chirping. Representatives from various countries first arrived on horseback to deliver the five-ring tickets, and under various lights, the magnificent and spectacular Bird's Nest appeared particularly dazzling and magnificent.
1:21:8|1:21:15|Athletes are entering the arena, with bands playing classic music from different continents, showcasing the styles of the five continents of the world in turn.
1:21:15|1:21:24|The little girl is performing aerial free ballet, and the athletes entering one after another are full of vitality and spirit, smiling and waving to the audience from time to time.
1:21:24|1:21:28|And the audience on site welcomed their arrival with enthusiastic applause and cheers.
1:21:29|1:21:37|In the sound of qin and se, messengers from different countries flew north through the night sky and performed various difficult opening shows at the Bird's Nest.
1:21:37|1:21:43|The light shone on them, eventually forming a shape of a dove, symbolizing world peace.
1:21:43|1:21:58|At the moment when the Olympic flame was lit, a huge torch suddenly burst into flames, and the burning Olympic flame illuminated the sky above the stadium, creating a brilliant scene. The dazzling fireworks rose synchronously, reflecting a blue rainbow in the sky above the stadium.
1:21:59|1:22:7|The lively music, enthusiastic cheers deafening, the atmosphere reaching its peak, and [Liu Li] will not give up the last moment's opportunity.
1:22:34|1:22:40|Liu Li stood directly opposite [Liu Li], like in a formal competition, the two of them stood facing each other in a bow to show respect.
1:22:40|1:22:51|Liu Li first walked to the center of the training ground, stood still, and then performed a somersault in the air. Unexpectedly, she was stopped by Han Bing, who told her not to make any moves.
1:22:51|1:22:56|Later, [Liu Li] imagined the opponent's appearance in the air, pushing off the ground with his right foot and rotating his hip joint to the left.
1:22:57|1:23:7|Then tightly clench both fists by the sides of the body, using the left foot as the axis, lifting the right foot heel off the ground, pushing the foot against the ground, quickly raising the knee forward, arching the foot back straight, and forcefully springing forward.
1:23:7|1:23:16|Following that, [Liu Li] switched legs in mid-air and threw punches, rotating his body 180 degrees backwards, occasionally shouting, with both power and speed in full force.
1:23:16|1:23:18|In these scenes, Han Bing watched everything.
1:23:18|1:23:22|He crossed his arms and watched [Liu Li] throw punches repeatedly.
1:23:22|1:23:25|The shadows of the two figures were cast under the street lamp, one tall and one short.
1:23:25|1:23:28|After the training, Han Bing helped [Liu Li] relax his muscles.
1:23:28|1:23:32|At this moment, [Liu Li] was lying quietly on the massage table with only a towel covering his body.
1:23:32|1:23:37|Han Bing rubbed oil on her hands, warming them up before pressing them firmly against her skin.
1:23:37|1:23:43|Starting from [Liu Li]'s neck, rub down vigorously until the jaw, then shift the pressure point to the arms.
1:23:43|1:23:47|Liu Li's expression is not as enjoyable as others, but rather somewhat anxious and anxious.
1:23:48|1:23:53|After Han Bing pressed for a while, [Liu Li] gradually entered a state of concentration, but it was not difficult to see that she had something on her mind.
1:23:53|1:24:5|[Liu Li] turns her head to the side, arms outstretched. Han Bing pulls up [Liu Li]'s calf, gently squeezing and relaxing before lifting it up for a stretch. However, [Liu Li] doesn't feel relaxed at all, instead staring blankly at a certain spot.
1:24:5|1:24:10|Upon returning to the hotel they were staying at, Yang Hui was helping [Liu Li] comb her hair. Seeing that Liu Li seemed distracted, she spoke up and asked.
1:24:23|1:24:28|Yang Hui nodded in agreement, playing with the comb in her hand.
1:24:42|1:24:53|Shortly after, [Liu Li] lay on Yang Hui's arms, seeming to relax a lot. She gazed at the ceiling absentmindedly, with a slight smile on her lips. The handsome cheeks seemed a bit thinner.
1:24:53|1:25:1|On the day of the finals, led by the representative of the Chinese team, [Liu Li], Yang Hui, and Han Bing entered the arena, causing the crowd to erupt in excitement. The commentator on the side began to give a brief introduction of [Liu Li].
1:25:13|1:25:17|His opponent is the famous Russian player Rice.
1:25:17|1:25:23|He has won the European competition championship and the world competition championship multiple times.
1:25:35|1:25:40|Chinese athlete [Liu Li], known for her fast movements and fierce attacks.
1:25:41|1:25:52|[Liu Li] has won the championship of this year's World Taekwondo Championships and has also achieved the best results in many world competitions.
1:25:52|1:25:58|[Rice] is a very strong player, rumored to be of European and American descent.
1:26:5|1:26:12|The match begins, with [Liu Li] and [Rice] facing each other. [Liu Li] starts off by kicking first, with her weight slightly leaning back.
1:26:12|1:26:22|[Rice] thought he had found an opportunity and started to kick towards [Liu Li], but [Liu Li] swiftly dodged [Rice]'s attack with a backstep, followed by a quick roundhouse kick to the back of [Rice].
1:26:23|1:26:26|[Rice] hit the ground heavily and went out of bounds.
1:26:26|1:26:33|To counterattack, [Lai Si] subtly shifted her weight back, which was more advantageous for the counterattack, deceiving [Liu Li].
1:26:33|1:26:42|Just as [Liu Li] was about to kick, [Rice] made a bump and a kick, causing [Liu Li] to fall to the ground. Both of them kept making encouraging sounds to boost their morale.
1:26:43|1:26:48|Han Bing was even more excited when he saw this, directing [Liu Li] with her head right on the spot.
1:26:50|1:26:58|Liu Li's sense of crisis is rising, her explosive power is stronger than Blue Silk, so she is more adept at using explosive power to launch attacks quickly and accurately.
1:26:58|1:27:13|But Liu Li is quite the opposite. His strategy is often to wear down his opponent's stamina. As long as Liu Li doesn't focus his weight in the center, he can deceive his opponent without exposing any flaws, such as pretending to counterattack, suddenly stealing a move, launching a surprise attack, catching the opponent off guard.
1:27:13|1:27:23|In the front court of the game, it is obvious that Lai is more dominant, and Liu Li has been blocked several times. The audience is more excited throughout the game, as the strength of these two players is evenly matched.
1:27:23|1:27:28|Just as [Liu Li] stood up again, it seemed like a magnetic field from Xiangxi formed between him and Lais.
1:27:28|1:27:36|Once the two of them are in the same frame, even with the referee trying to intervene in between, they cannot stop the confrontation between the two Taekwondo masters.
1:27:36|1:27:43|With a confrontational attitude from the moment they met, [Liu Li] was once again kicked to the ground, followed by a back kick from Lais, then quickly retracting his right foot along the power line.
1:27:43|1:27:50|Liu Li not only was kicked to the ground, but also his left arm violently collided with the ground. Han Bing and Yang Hui were anxiously stomping their feet in the audience.
1:27:50|1:28:0|Even though [Liu Li] was knocked down time and time again, she kept repeating the rhythm of falling and getting up, until Les attacked her injured arm once again, a sharp pain striking her.
1:28:0|1:28:8|[Liu Li] lay on the ground unable to get up, hiding his arms in his chest and abdomen, a sensation that cut into his bone marrow swept through his body, causing [Liu Li] to roll frantically on the ground.
1:28:31|1:28:39|With a scream from [Liu Li], her mind was brought back to reality, showing how ruthless Han Bing was at that time, and how passionate the atmosphere was at the competition venue.
1:29:48|1:29:59|After a moment of inner struggle, [Liu Li] felt numbness in his left hand due to the pain. He tightly bound his left hand with his right hand, and let out a sorrowful cry towards the sky, as if bidding farewell to himself.
1:29:59|1:30:4|Liu Li's opponent, Les, didn't even understand his situation, and the referee was even cheering for him on the side.
1:30:5|1:30:24|Han Bing looked worried on the sidelines, while [Liu Li] clenched his fists and swung fiercely at Han Bing from a distance. Taking advantage of the opponent's unpreparedness, he delivered several hard kicks, originally just hitting the body, but now directly targeting the head. [Liu Li]'s helmet was already soaked with sweat, and with this kick, the sweat flew out directly, leaving his head in a daze.
1:30:24|1:30:27|Until [Liu Li] realized that she was being kicked repeatedly.
1:30:28|1:30:40|[Liu Li] just realized that the audience below saw this scene, and the crowd became even more excited. Some audience members even cheered and cheered for [Liu Li], hoping that [Liu Li] could counterattack fiercely.
1:30:40|1:30:49|At this moment, [Liu Li]'s expression became more ferocious, his pupils dilated, staring fixedly at his opponent. In a trance, he recalled his grandfather's words in his mind.
1:30:56|1:31:1|The opponent is still unaware of what [Liu Li] is about to do next, feeling a bit relaxed.
1:31:1|1:31:11|However, with each shout, [Liu Li] pinched his arm towards the chest protector, drew the bowstring, kicked wildly, leaped up, and with a final kick, Lais was defeated.
1:31:12|1:31:17|The referee quickly ran to Liu Li's side and started counting down to the whole audience, but unfortunately Liu Li struggled to get up.
1:31:17|1:31:25|Shortly after, the referee made a gesture of defeat, and [Liu Li], overwhelmed with excitement, lost balance due to exhaustion and fell directly to his knees on the platform.
1:31:25|1:31:32|Waving her right fist towards [Yang Hui] and [Han Bing] off the field, she took off her helmet, sweat and tears mingling together.
1:31:32|1:31:49|Still unable to distinguish between sweat and tears, [Liu Li] slowly regained her composure. Joy had overwhelmed her mind, the smile on her face still covering her left arm, but she slowly stood up, deeply bowing to the audience. She had surpassed herself, screaming in excitement.
1:31:49|1:31:57|Shortly after, [Han Bing] and [Yang Hui] entered the scene. [Liu Li] embraced them affectionately, and the audience cheered for her as she was overwhelmed with joy and tears.
1:31:58|1:32:7|At the end of the match, the master and disciples embraced tightly, with dazzling lights shimmering above the stadium, as if all were cheering for [Liu Li].
1:32:7|1:32:12|This time, [Liu Li] not only surpassed the enemy, but also surpassed himself.
1:32:12|1:32:17|He also pays tribute to the Olympic spirit, which is a spirit that will never be defeated by the enemy.
1:32:18|1:32:24|At the end of the film is a scene of [Liu Li] holding a gold medal, with the five-star red flag representing China in the background.
1:32:24|1:32:33|Her face is filled with the vigor of youth, as well as the determination and firmness of an athlete.
