0:0:54|0:1:0|On the calm river surface, a young boy is sitting in a wooden boat happily fishing.
0:1:0|0:1:7|Gunshots came from the direction of the Japanese fort on the other side of the river, as they were searching for the Eighth Route Army.
0:1:7|0:1:13|Gunfire was falling intermittently, and a Eighth Route Army soldier fell into the river.
0:1:13|0:1:15|The boy was frightened, a fierce word pierced into the mouse.
0:1:22|0:1:29|In the midst of the intense gunfire, a hand suddenly grabbed onto the wooden boat, it was none other than the Eighth Route Army soldier who fell into the river.
0:1:29|0:1:39|He looked left and right, then pushed hard and jumped onto the boat.
0:1:39|0:1:48|[Zhang Ga] had just paddled the oars a few times when suddenly a bullet struck his left arm, causing him to stagger and fall on the boat.
0:1:51|0:2:1|The wooden boat drifted slowly into the distance, while on the shore, the enemy's search continued.
0:2:1|0:2:12|At this moment, as the sky darkened, the enemy shone flashlights onto the water, trying to find the traces of the Eighth Route Army.
0:2:12|0:2:19|The wooden boat drifted aimlessly, floating into a patch of reeds, surrounded by silence.
0:2:22|0:2:38|The boat moved slowly, leaving behind layers of ripples, and soon entered deep into the reeds.
0:2:38|0:2:41|At this moment, someone suddenly emerged from underwater.
0:2:42|0:2:45|It is the young man who was just fishing.
0:2:45|0:2:50|He lay on the side of the boat, looked at the fallen Eighth Route Army soldiers on the boat, and then dived into the water.
0:2:50|0:2:54|He is the protagonist of our story today, [Zhang Ga].
0:2:54|0:3:1|The story of [Zhang Ga] takes place in 1943, the most brutal days of the War of Resistance against Japan.
0:3:1|0:3:7|The deputy company commander of the Eighth Route Army was injured during a mission and was brought back home by the fisherman [Zhang Ga] in a boat.
0:3:7|0:3:10|Our story begins here.
0:3:14|0:3:19|At night, at Zhang Ga's home, the health worker is rechecking Luo Jinbao's injuries.
0:3:19|0:3:24|Grandma stood aside, holding a candle, frowning with worry.
0:3:24|0:3:29|But when looking at [Luo Jinbao], a kind smile appeared again.
0:3:29|0:3:30|The young sanitation worker exclaimed with delight.
0:3:40|0:3:40|[Luo Jinbao] smiled.
0:3:40|0:3:42|Grandma pretends to be strange.
0:3:42|0:3:43|After Grandma finished speaking, she stood up and placed the bamboo tray on the table.
0:4:21|0:4:26|The medic handed the medicine to [Luo Jinbao].
0:4:49|0:4:51|[Luo Jinbao] took out an old tobacco pipe as he spoke.
0:4:57|0:5:3|The medic struck a match and lit the pipe for [Zhang Ga] while saying.
0:5:8|0:5:19|It's Zhang Ga who's back, only to see Zhang Ga bare-chested, covered in mud, holding a fish in his hand, proudly lifting up the big fish.
0:5:43|0:5:45|[Zhang Ga] rushed down to the side of [Sergeant Chung].
0:6:2|0:6:18|[Zhang Ga] jumped off the kang, scooped up a basin of water, and buried his entire face in it, shaking his head in the water.
0:6:23|0:6:30|In the next scene, at the entrance of the village under the big banyan tree, [Village Chief] Chungen is passing by.
0:6:30|0:6:42|Suddenly, [Luo Jinbao] saw someone hiding in the tree, and [Zhang Ga] jumped down from the tree.
0:6:42|0:6:44|[Zhang Ga] looked around vigilantly.
0:6:50|0:6:54|[Zhang Ga] was about to leave when Uncle [Chun Gang] handed him a bag of rice.
0:6:54|0:6:55|[Zhang Ga] smiled and ran back home.
0:7:15|0:7:31|Grandma is making pancakes at home, [Zhang Ga] comes back from outside, the cat is at the door, sniffing the aroma of the pancakes, knocking and walking into the house, reaching out to steal one from the basket.
0:7:47|0:7:51|Grandma nodded.
0:7:51|0:7:59|Grandma took the rice and put it on the stove, then walked to the table and wrapped the scrambled eggs in the pancake basket together.
0:7:59|0:8:1|[Zhang Ga] smoothly placed the chopsticks inside.
0:8:1|0:8:3|[Zhang Ga] is trying to steal food again.
0:8:13|0:8:25|[Zhang Ga] climbed onto the kang and lifted the years on the wall, revealing a small hidden door behind the flowers. [Zhang Ga] agilely crawled out through it.
0:8:25|0:8:34|Grandma supported her youth on one side and looked around cautiously.
0:8:34|0:8:39|Grandma closed the door opening, then lowered the curtain, covering the door opening.
0:8:40|0:8:44|In the backyard, [Zhang Ga] hunched over and walked through the path formed by the thatched fence and the wall.
0:8:44|0:8:47|They arrived in a yard overgrown with wild grass.
0:8:47|0:8:52|The courtyard has been uninhabited for over ten years, with the windows all bricked up.
0:8:52|0:9:4|In the room, [Lao Zhongshu] was making a wooden gun with the few rays of sunlight coming in.
0:9:7|0:9:15|[Master Zhongshu] eagerly moved the pillar blocking the door, opened it, and let [Zhang Ga] crawl in from the hole in the brick wall outside the door.
0:9:15|0:9:34|[Zhang Ga] mischievously tried to scare [Luo Zhongshu], and after bringing [Zhang Ga] in, [Luo Zhongshu] quickly closed the door and propped it up with a pillar.
0:10:7|0:10:11|[Zhang Ga] is extremely happy.
0:10:11|0:10:24|[Zhang Ga] performed the scene of fighting the Japanese invaders with a wooden gun.
0:10:24|0:10:29|[Zhang Ga] pointed a wooden gun at the back of the platoon leader.
0:11:13|0:11:32|Once, when he went to Baoding Prefecture to gather intelligence and returned, he had just walked onto the road when he encountered two traitors, who pointed two bayonets at his chest. At this moment, [Luo Jinbao] remained calm, with a slight smile on his face.
0:11:43|0:11:49|He slowly raised his hands, and the two traitors leaned forward, about to touch his waist.
0:11:59|0:12:31|Outside, gunshots were really heard, indicating that the Japanese invaders had entered the village. [Zhang Ga] immediately hugged [Luo Jinbao], who was about to take [Zhang Ga] to escape. However, two collaborators appeared outside and discovered a hole in the brick wall. One of them walked over and poked the door inside the hole with a gun, but failed to open it.
0:12:31|0:12:41|In the room, [Lao Zhongshu] handed the sickle to [Zhang Ga] and took a wooden stick for himself, standing guard behind the door.
0:12:41|0:12:47|The impostor dare not enter rashly, and comes to the window blocked by bricks, considering breaking into the window.
0:13:0|0:13:12|One of them was stepping on the other, the one below was reluctant and wobbling, while the one on top was cursing and wildly stabbing towards the window.
0:13:17|0:13:25|The falling clod from the window hit Captain Zhong and [Zhang Ga] directly in the face.
0:13:25|0:13:33|[Zhang Ga] couldn't bear it at first, but seeing that the platoon leader remained unfazed, [Zhang Ga] also became brave.
0:13:33|0:13:39|[Zhang Ga] stood on top and pried open the window, peering inside with wide eyes.
0:14:6|0:14:10|While two pseudo-soldiers went to seek reinforcements, Lao Zhongshu quickly led [Zhang Ga] to move.
0:14:18|0:14:25|They wanted to return to [Zhang Ga]'s home along the path by the wall and the wall base, but they heard the voice of the impostor inside the house.
0:14:35|0:14:41|Reluctantly, the two of them had no choice but to return to the backyard.
0:14:41|0:14:51|Seeing no one around, [Zhang Ga] and Lao Zhong climbed out of the backyard from the wall.
0:14:51|0:14:54|They hid behind a mud wall.
0:15:3|0:15:18|[Zhang Ga] crawled out of the door opening, then cautiously felt his way forward along the wall, constantly looking around at the surroundings.
0:15:18|0:15:25|The platoon leader Zhang Ga had just walked through an alley when he unexpectedly encountered a group of pseudo soldiers who were about to take away the villagers.
0:15:36|0:15:53|He immediately turned around, only to collide with enemies coming from another direction.
0:15:53|0:15:58|Zhang Ga saw Lao Zhongshu being taken away, he became anxious and ran to the rooftop.
0:16:4|0:16:5|Uzuri is in a mess, with things scattered all over the floor.
0:16:31|0:16:38|[Zhang Ga] looked at the dilapidated house with great sadness, but he did not see his grandmother's figure, which made him extremely anxious.
0:16:46|0:16:53|[Zhang Ga] ran out crying and shouting, and as the scene shifted, it was his grandmother.
0:16:53|0:17:8|The camera pans across the square, crowded with people. The entire village is here. In front, there is a large group of Japanese soldiers and collaborators, as well as the military officer [Luo Jinbao] and his chubby translator.
0:17:8|0:17:12|They pressed Grandma in front of the whole village, forcing her to reveal the whereabouts of the Eighth Route Army.
0:17:16|0:17:31|The pole also arrived, she squeezed in from the back of the crowd, constantly looking around anxiously, searching desperately, but she just couldn't see [Grandma].
0:17:31|0:17:33|She squeezed past one after another.
0:17:34|0:17:39|Suddenly, a strong hand grabbed Zhang Ga's arm.
0:17:39|0:17:42|He looked up and saw his uncle [Luo Jinbao].
0:17:42|0:17:48|He followed [Luo Jinbao]'s gaze and saw [Grandma] standing in front of everyone.
0:17:48|0:17:55|The Japanese officer, [Gui Tian], with a cigarette in his mouth and a cloth in his hand, slowly walked up to [Grandma].
0:18:6|0:18:13|[Grandma] turned her head slowly, gave her a cold look, then turned away and ignored her.
0:18:13|0:18:20|Gui Tian, feeling helpless, ran to the other side of [Grandma] and threatened again.
0:18:20|0:18:26|[Grandma] remains unmoved.
0:18:26|0:18:31|[Grandma] still didn't bat an eyelid, [Gui Tian] had no choice but to call [Pang Dun].
0:19:5|0:19:22|Gui Tian, feeling unthreatened, drove away the pseudo army officer and stepped forward to speak.
0:19:22|0:19:27|However, Grandma still gazed firmly ahead, making the Japanese soldiers furious.
0:19:37|0:19:48|Grandma lowered her head slightly, glanced at the bayonet hanging around her neck, and chuckled contemptuously, showing no fear.
0:19:48|0:20:3|The fake soldiers on the side stabbed Grandma [Zhang Ga] with the gun barrel.
0:20:3|0:20:7|[Zhang Ga]'s grandmother tightly closed her eyes in pain, but still didn't utter a word.
0:20:12|0:20:19|The Japanese soldier went crazy and drew his sword, chopping towards Grandma.
0:20:19|0:20:35|The voice came from behind, and everyone turned back. They saw Zhang Ga walking out from the crowd. Some villagers wanted to stop him, but Zhang Ga shook his head with a smile, then walked towards the enemy with big steps.
0:20:35|0:20:37|The villagers began to worry one after another.
0:20:41|0:20:52|Captain Zhong walked up to the Japanese soldiers, and Zhang Ga, Uncle Chun Gang, Grandma, and other villagers were all anxious.
0:20:52|0:20:57|[Gui Tian] walked towards Captain Zhong in astonishment.
0:20:57|0:20:59|Grandma tried to stop him, but was blocked by a bayonet.
0:21:10|0:21:46|Gui Tian was injured by a knife. He raised his thumb in approval, and Lao Zhong smiled and gestured for him to come closer. Gui Tian happily approached, but as soon as he got close, the company commander raised his hand and punched him, causing Gui Tian to fall to the ground in anger, ready to draw his sword.
0:21:46|0:21:51|Captain Zhong glanced at him contemptuously.
0:21:51|0:22:0|The Japanese had no choice but to arrest him first.
0:22:5|0:22:17|The infuriated Japanese soldier turned and fired a shot at [Ma Dongmei].
0:22:17|0:22:24|In the wailing of [Zhang Ga], grandma's body slowly fell down.
0:22:24|0:22:28|Under the pressure of the Japanese invaders, the Eighth Route Army was forced to move elsewhere.
0:22:29|0:22:37|And here, [Zhang Ga], with the help of Uncle Chungang, took care of his grandmother's affairs and was about to set off to find the team.
0:23:19|0:23:28|Taking the shoes and dry food handed over by Zhang Ga, Luo Jinbao set off on his own to search for the Eighth Route Army.
0:23:54|0:24:0|Ka Zi arrived at a riverbank, walking barefoot along the river.
0:24:5|0:24:15|The river was wide, and [Zhang Ga] carried the bundle on his head as he swam across.
0:24:15|0:24:22|As soon as he got ashore, he encountered a group of Japanese soldiers.
0:24:22|0:24:25|[Zhang Ga] quickly took off his straw hat and hid in a small ditch by the road.
0:24:26|0:24:42|He looked at the little devils with eyes full of anger, but there were too many devils, and the deep hatred could not be avenged. [Zhang Ga] remembered breaking a wild grass nearby, and pulled out the pistol tucked in his belt.
0:24:42|0:24:56|Unfortunately, it was just a wooden Ga Da. [Zhang Ga] could only tuck it into his arms again, glanced at his worn-out straw shoes, and decided to throw them away in frustration, walking barefoot.
0:24:59|0:25:6|The scene shifts, [Zhang Ga] enters the town and is drinking water by a well.
0:25:6|0:25:17|At this moment, a middle-aged man rode past on a bicycle.
0:25:17|0:25:28|[Zhang Ga] turned his head and saw the man dressed like a traitor, who was walking alone. He parked his bicycle at the door and then turned into a courtyard.
0:25:29|0:25:43|With a smirk on Zhang Ga's face, he started scheming again.
0:25:43|0:25:54|[Zhang Ga] quietly hid behind the stone wall, seeing no one around, he casually broke off a small branch.
0:26:12|0:26:18|Zhang Ga actually punctured the tire.
0:26:18|0:26:21|Zhang Ga quickly hid behind the pole.
0:26:21|0:26:28|After a while, Zhang Ga came out, got on the car, but just after a few steps, he found that the tire was flat.
0:26:29|0:26:40|[Zhang Ga], who was hiding on the side, saw his ambition work out and quietly chuckled, covering his mouth.
0:26:40|0:26:55|The man pushed the car to a big tree, took out the air pump, and bent down to inflate the tire.
0:26:55|0:26:59|However, he did not notice the little Ga who was following behind him.
0:27:30|0:27:39|Unexpectedly, the man turned around and knocked the pole to the ground, wearing a pair of sunglasses and holding a gun in his hand.
0:27:39|0:27:47|The man took off his sunglasses and saw Zhang Ga, he was stunned for a moment.
0:27:47|0:27:53|He walked over, picked up the wooden gun on the ground, and walked half a circle around the pole that had been knocked down.
0:28:4|0:28:8|[Zhang Ga] reluctantly stood up and patted his bottom.
0:28:8|0:28:10|[Zhang Ga] turned his head, unwilling to say more to him.
0:28:34|0:28:38|[Zhang Ga] suddenly refused to answer and walked away.
0:28:40|0:28:45|[Zhang Ga] reluctantly squatted on the ground, realizing there was no way out.
0:28:45|0:28:54|The man walked over and pushed the cart, arriving in front of [Zhang Ga].
0:29:4|0:29:11|The man with a pole arrived at a house, before he reached the door, someone came out to greet him.
0:29:33|0:29:38|The man entered the courtyard with a pole, becoming alert.
0:29:38|0:29:53|He looked around to make sure no one was there before pulling the pole and walking down another small path.
0:29:53|0:29:59|Zhang Ga moved the pile of grass aside, then felt his way forward and pushed open a trapdoor.
0:30:4|0:30:13|He took two more steps forward, turned a corner, and then climbed over a row of rooftops.
0:30:13|0:30:22|Finally, Zhang Ga arrived at a nondescript small door with a pole in hand.
0:30:22|0:30:27|A person is standing guard at the door, holding a gun in hand.
0:30:47|0:31:6|The man finished speaking and left. [Zhang Ga] looked around the room, where some were cutting hair for others, some were wiping gun barrels, some were practicing aiming, some were smoking a pipe and tapping out a rhythm, and some were mending clothes, all dressed in military uniforms.
0:31:9|0:31:18|A person is wiping a machine gun. [Zhang Ga] sees it and is very happy, unable to resist going forward to touch it.
0:31:40|0:31:44|The man who brought in [Zhang Ga] earlier shouted,
0:31:44|0:32:14|[Zhang Ga] followed him into the room and saw an older man sitting inside. The man glanced at [Zhang Ga], smiled slightly, put down what he was holding, picked up a Buddha statue, fanned himself while pretending to look elsewhere, then suddenly shouted, "Zhang Ga!"
0:32:40|0:32:49|[Zhang Ga] excitedly threw himself into [Luo Jinbao]'s arms, finally finding a family member. The sadness in [Zhang Ga]'s heart could no longer be hidden.
0:32:49|0:32:58|Seeing [Zhang Ga] crying loudly, the older man felt sorry for him and pulled him to sit down on a chair.
0:33:19|0:33:25|[Luo Jinbao] and the district captain, upon meeting [Zhang Ga], both had a heart full of pity in their eyes.
0:33:25|0:33:32|Captain Qu introduced Zhang Ga to the other comrades in the team.
0:33:38|0:33:41|[Zhang Ga] stood up with a clapperboard in hand, and everyone was drinking clapperboard wine.
0:35:19|0:35:22|Captain Qu said again.
0:35:35|0:35:43|Seeing [Zhang Ga] wearing loose clothes with an open chest, the health worker put Xiao Hao's clothes on [Zhang Ga].
0:36:44|0:36:51|Everyone started packing up their things, and the team began to move.
0:36:51|0:36:57|The group marched forward in a neat line.
0:37:30|0:37:43|After trekking by land and water, and even passing by the enemy's watchtower, [Zhang Ga] followed the district captain and [Luo Jinbao] quietly slipped through from under the enemy's noses.
0:37:43|0:37:49|They walked through the cornfield.
0:37:49|0:37:54|Sometimes, Luo Jinbao rides a bicycle with Zhang Ga sitting in the back.
0:37:59|0:38:13|He had a small twig in his mouth, revealing a sweet smile.
0:38:13|0:38:23|That day, [Zhang Ga] followed Uncle Luo on a mission. They set up a stall not far from the Japanese artillery tower and started selling watermelons.
0:38:23|0:38:40|The scorching heat was unbearable, and [Pang Dun] came out alone, licking his belly. Seeing him walking towards [Zhang Ga], [Luo Jinbao] poked [Zhang Ga] with a fan.
0:38:40|0:38:47|Pang Dun squatted directly in front of the stall, patting this and knocking on that.
0:39:25|0:39:31|[Pang Dun] was rude and arrogant, [Zhang Ga] was angry and wanted to teach him a lesson, but was stopped by old Uncle [Luo Jinbao].
0:40:3|0:40:17|[Zhang Ga] threw a watermelon up.
0:40:17|0:40:23|[Zhang Ga] happily returned to the village with the captured gun and told the children about what had happened.
0:40:36|0:40:42|That guy is really arrogant.
0:41:8|0:41:14|That guy really followed orders and obediently raised both heads.
0:41:43|0:41:54|Saying that, [Zhang Ga], imitating the appearance of an adult, also tied a white towel on his head, and stood solemnly on the high platform, imitating a leader giving a speech.
0:43:29|0:43:45|The scene shifts to inside the house, where Mr. Zhang Ga is truly a hero among men. Despite the relentless interrogation and torture by the Japanese soldiers, he always maintains a cold smile and a few words, earning admiration from all.
0:44:10|0:44:22|[Pang Dun] met [Zhang Ga] who was grinning from ear to ear.
0:44:33|0:44:34|Ka Zi was extremely happy.
0:45:30|0:45:37|[Zhang Ga] turned away in anger as Captain Qu walked up to him.
0:46:11|0:46:15|[Zhang Ga] ran away with tears in his eyes.
0:46:16|0:46:20|Zhang Ga felt extremely sad when his steel-toed gun was lost.
0:46:20|0:46:29|He sat on the hillside alone, fuming, pulling at the weeds angrily, when suddenly he remembered the wooden gun at his waist.
0:46:31|0:46:44|He took out the wooden gun from his waist, almost about to throw it out, but Zhang Ga looked at the wooden gun in his hand, thinking of the captured old Zhongshu, feeling even more sad.
0:46:44|0:46:50|At this moment, a kid about the same age as Zhang Ga, named Pang Dun, came over.
0:47:2|0:47:24|[Zhang Ga] saw [Pang Dun] unwilling, [Pang Dun] scratched his head anxiously. Suddenly he remembered the string of firecrackers around his waist, so he climbed up the tree with the firecrackers. [Zhang Ga] dragged his cheeks in distress, then he saw the string of firecrackers. It turned out that [Pang Dun] deliberately showed it to [Zhang Ga] on the tree.
0:47:33|0:47:37|Glancing up, the bird's nest was on the highest branch.
0:48:10|0:48:18|[Zhang Ga] and [Pang Dun] were seen finding a place to put down firecrackers and wooden guns as prizes for their bet.
0:48:18|0:48:25|Taking off his clothes and belt, [Zhang Ga] stood on a piece of open ground, with his friends gathering around to watch.
0:48:31|0:48:49|At the very beginning, the two of them immediately assumed a stance, pushing against each other with all their might. [Zhang Ga] gritted his teeth, while [Pang Dun]'s body collided like a young calf, stabilizing his lower body.
0:48:49|0:48:58|[Zhang Ga] bent down, but instead of being able to attack the lower body of [Pang Dun], he was hit with a powerful blow from above, knocking him down directly.
0:49:14|0:49:17|[Zhang Ga] took off his coat directly, and the second round began.
0:49:23|0:49:28|The two were wrestling, and [Pang Dun]'s father happened to pass by and came to watch.
0:49:28|0:49:32|[Zhang Ga] gritted his teeth, exerted all his strength, and tried to bring down his opponent.
0:49:32|0:49:37|But [Pang Dun] also exerted all his strength, not giving him any chance at all.
0:49:37|0:49:46|The two of them were grappling back and forth, neither giving in, wrestling together.
0:49:46|0:49:48|The children on the side cheered them on.
0:49:56|0:50:7|[Zhang Ga] was no match for the young calf, and was directly lifted onto the shoulders by [Pang Dun].
0:50:7|0:50:10|The next moment, the two of them were wrestling and rolling down the hill.
0:50:20|0:50:28|Two people were seen getting up from the ground, and the standoff became even more intense.
0:50:28|0:50:34|[Zhang Ga] tried hard, but soon [Pang Dun] picked up [Zhang Ga] again.
0:50:34|0:50:37|[Zhang Ga], eager for victory, actually bit [Pang Dun]'s shoulder directly.
0:51:0|0:51:5|[Zhang Ga] awkwardly turned his back and hid behind a tree.
0:51:5|0:51:10|At this moment, Pang Dun's father walked over and said.
0:51:23|0:51:36|[Pang Dun] went home with his dad, and the other kids all dispersed.
0:51:36|0:51:41|[Zhang Ga] had his gun confiscated, lost a bet and was accused of being a sore loser, feeling very annoyed.
0:51:53|0:51:58|[Zhang Ga] walked to the stone in frustration and picked up his clothes.
0:52:20|0:52:39|[Zhang Ga] quickly climbed up a tree, shuttling back and forth between the branches. Then he wandered on the rooftops, agilely moving from one roof to another. In no time, he was walking back and forth on a ladder.
0:52:39|0:52:45|[Zhang Ga] draped his coat over his body, hands in pockets, occasionally kicking the small stones on the ground with his foot.
0:53:12|0:53:17|After a while, [Zhang Ga] got tired and sat down by a chimney.
0:53:21|0:53:27|Unexpectedly, Zhang Ga was choked by the billowing smoke, tears streaming down his face.
0:53:27|0:53:39|[Zhang Ga] lay on the roof, looking down.
0:53:39|0:53:42|It just so happens that this is the roof of [Pang Dun]'s house.
0:53:42|0:53:48|[Zhang Ga] cleverly stuffed the hay from the roof into the chimney upside down.
0:53:59|0:54:8|The smoke from the farm indeed all went down, making [Pang Dun] and his son cough continuously.
0:54:8|0:54:12|[Zhang Ga] was sneering, only to be caught by [Pang Dun].
0:54:20|0:54:25|Back in the courtyard, the team leader placed a basket of cakes in front of [Zhang Ga].
0:54:28|0:54:32|[Zhang Ga] picked up a cake and started chewing on it.
0:55:31|0:55:41|[Pang Dun]'s father was about to speak, but was stopped by a gesture from the district captain. [Zhang Ga] turned angrily and walked into the house, still making a face at [Pang Dun] through the window.
0:55:44|0:55:53|[Zhang Ga] got off the kang, tiptoed to the door, and hid behind it, trying to eavesdrop on the conversation outside.
0:55:53|0:55:58|Unfortunately, he leaned in close and listened for a long time, but still couldn't make out a single word.
0:55:58|0:56:3|[Zhang Ga] sullenly ran to the spinning wheel and idly turned its wheel.
0:56:13|0:56:28|[Zhang Ga] sat down at the table, put the belt on his head, and opened a notebook, drawing something on it.
0:56:28|0:56:31|At this moment, Captain Zhang Ga walked in.
0:57:11|0:57:30|Captain Qu placed the food in front of [Zhang Ga], just as [Luo Jinbao] returned.
0:57:30|0:57:33|[Zhang Ga] ran to the door and pricked up his ears to eavesdrop.
0:57:38|0:57:39|While the district captain was away, [Zhang Ga] quickly begged [Luo Jinbao].
0:58:50|0:59:4|Early the next morning, [Pang Dun] had already set up an ambush waiting for the enemy, with [Zhang Ga] among them. The soldiers looked serious, observing the surroundings carefully.
0:59:4|0:59:9|From a distance, two large trucks filled with soldiers drove by.
0:59:10|0:59:18|As soon as their car entered the ambush circle, it triggered a landmine.
0:59:18|0:59:32|Upon the captain's command, the enemies quickly got off the car, took out their weapons, and hurriedly prepared to fight back.
0:59:32|0:59:35|The soldiers shouted and charged towards the enemy.
0:59:36|0:59:47|Facing the strong offensive of our army, the enemy quickly couldn't hold on and had to retreat to the river behind them.
0:59:49|0:59:56|On the other side of the river, [Luo Jinbao] and his gang, including [Gan Zi], had already set up an ambush, just waiting for the enemy to take the bait.
0:59:56|1:0:1|The soldiers stared at the river, waiting for the perfect moment.
1:0:7|1:0:31|When the enemy was about to cross the river, [Luo Jinbao] gave the order, and the soldiers threw grenades one after another. With [Luo Jinbao] joining the battle, countless shells flew from all directions, exploding on the river surface. It was a pincer attack, causing the little devils to be surrounded and flee in panic.
1:0:37|1:0:46|[Zhang Ga] also joined the battle, and the soldiers rushed down to engage the enemy in hand-to-hand combat.
1:0:46|1:0:58|A Japanese soldier raised a sword and swung it towards Luo Jinbao. Luo Jinbao managed to snatch the sword from the soldier's hand, lifted him high, and then threw him heavily into the water.
1:1:4|1:1:14|In the midst of chaos, a pseudo-soldier tried to escape but was caught red-handed by [Zhang Ga].
1:1:14|1:1:23|The person is running faster, the battle is still going on fiercely here, while [Zhang Ga] is also chasing the escaped fish on the other side.
1:1:23|1:1:31|In the chaos, the fleeing pseudo-soldier fired a shot at [Zhang Ga], who picked up a stone from the ground and threw it back.
1:1:33|1:1:38|The pseudo-soldier fell into the water.
1:1:38|1:1:54|The pseudo-soldier turned around, wanting to continue shooting, but the bullets in the gun had already run out.
1:1:54|1:1:59|[Zhang Ga] leaped into the water, pounced forward, and wrestled with the pseudo-soldier.
1:2:3|1:2:7|[Zhang Ga] bit down on the pseudo-soldier's wrist and took away his pistol.
1:2:17|1:2:30|[Zhang Ga] was very pleased, pressing the puppet troops while looking for the platoon leader, and tapping the real thing in his hand. Meanwhile, the platoon leader was directing the soldiers to clean up the battlefield and collect the spoils.
1:2:30|1:2:38|[Zhang Ga] walked over with the pseudo army, and when he saw the district captain from a distance, he quickly hid the real thing he was holding in his arms.
1:2:41|1:2:44|At this moment, [Luo Jinbao] walked over.
1:2:47|1:2:50|[Zhang Ga] has hidden the gun.
1:2:51|1:2:55|[Zhang Ga] brought the pseudo army to the front of the district captain.
1:3:4|1:3:6|Captain Qu casually patted Zhang Ga's buttocks.
1:3:11|1:3:13|Yang Xiaogen carried [Zhang Ga] on his back.
1:3:38|1:3:55|The scene shifts, the calm water surface reflecting the beautiful scenery on the shore. Injured Zhang Ga is leaning on the boat as it slowly sails on the river. Sitting across from him is a handsome young girl named Yuying.
1:3:55|1:4:3|[Zhang Ga] bent down and covered his stomach, then pulled out a real gun from his pocket.
1:4:24|1:4:36|[Zhang Ga] took a boat to Yu Ying's house to recuperate, the boat sailed through dense reeds, with a row of fishing boats in the distance, and the fishermen were busy.
1:5:1|1:5:10|The sunlight spilled onto the water, shimmering through the dew with a sparkling light.
1:6:1|1:6:11|On the other side, another large group of tail poles slowly moved on the water surface, with the poles guiding the boat to the side of the tail poles.
1:6:11|1:6:21|He reached out and pulled out a tail pole, only to find a person hidden underneath, spraying a mouthful of water all over the face of the pole.
1:6:37|1:6:50|Rumors had it that Zhang Ga saw a large group of Lu porcelain not far away, which made him itch with excitement. Taking advantage of the unguarded imperial physician, Zhang Ga immediately jumped into the water.
1:6:55|1:7:3|[Zhang Ga], who just got off the water, is even more cheerful than a stove. On the boat, [Luo Jinbao] is sulking alone.
1:7:3|1:7:11|[Zhang Ga] quietly swam over and gently rocked the boat, but [Luo Jinbao] was still angry.
1:7:11|1:7:16|She reached out and caught a big fish from a distance, throwing it onto the boat. [Luo Jinbao] happily picked up the fish.
1:7:33|1:7:37|[Zhang Ga] picked up an oar and assumed a fighting stance similar to wielding a knife.
1:7:51|1:7:57|The boat was rocking back and forth, with voices talking in the background.
1:8:33|1:8:38|Zhang Ga stood on the side of the boat, singing a song while marching in small steps.
1:9:5|1:9:7|[Zhang Ga] excitedly threw himself into his arms.
1:9:21|1:9:27|[Zhang Ga] happily took the package and opened it to find biscuits and canned food.
1:9:31|1:9:35|[Luo Jinbao] took a bag of cookies, then took a can of food, carefully examining them.
1:10:12|1:10:20|After Uncle Luo finished his task, he turned around and hurriedly boarded the boat.
1:10:53|1:11:2|Zhang Ga watched as [Luo Jinbao] walked away, his eyes rolling around, his mischievous mind at work again.
1:11:2|1:11:3|Night.
1:12:49|1:12:56|After speaking, [Zhang Ga] remembered the captured old Zhongshu, his eyes becoming even more determined.
1:12:56|1:13:6|The next morning, as the sky was just getting light, [Luo Jinbao] and his parents caught a basket full of fish and returned home with a full load.
1:13:40|1:13:44|When Zhang Ga's father came home and took a look, the water tank was full of water.
1:13:52|1:14:1|Ruiyin showed the painting on the table to her parents.
1:14:33|1:14:43|[Zhang Ga] returned to the village of Old Man Man's house. Just as he arrived at the village entrance, he could hear a commotion inside.
1:14:52|1:14:56|It turns out that the bandits were robbing the civilians.
1:14:56|1:15:0|[Zhang Ga] lifted his robe to reveal the real gun hidden at his waist.
1:15:3|1:15:5|He then headed in another direction.
1:15:12|1:15:22|Originally, this clever little thug wanted to hide the gun in the bird's nest of the big tree by the river.
1:15:22|1:15:38|After a while, two pseudo-soldiers in the village swaggered with the ducks they had just stolen, suddenly seeing [Zhang Ga] walking hurriedly, arousing suspicion in their hearts.
1:15:50|1:16:4|[Zhang Ga] turned and ran, the pseudo army soldiers immediately gave chase with their guns.
1:16:4|1:16:11|[Zhang Ga] ran to [Pang Dun]'s house and ran into Pang Dun's father who was working.
1:16:17|1:16:39|Uncle Lao Man quickly took [Zhang Ga] into the house, and at this moment, the pseudo army came chasing after them.
1:16:39|1:16:43|Uncle Man pretended to have just woken up and went out the door.
1:16:55|1:17:1|The door opens, but it's [Pang Dun] rubbing his eyes who comes out.
1:17:1|1:17:6|He stretched lazily.
1:17:6|1:17:11|The impostor king looked up and down.
1:17:43|1:17:47|Da Zi first opened the curtains and saw the scenery outside, feeling relaxed.
1:18:4|1:18:19|When the pseudo-soldiers were about to take away [Pang Dun], [Zhang Ga] stepped forward.
1:18:34|1:18:39|The bandits grabbed the pole, flipped it over, and aimed a blow at his wrist.
1:19:14|1:19:17|The scene cuts to [Zhang Ga] being taken into the enemy's stronghold.
1:19:41|1:19:45|Captain Wei was about to step forward, but he was knocked down by a pole.
1:19:50|1:19:52|Old [Gui Tian] is here.
1:19:58|1:20:15|Gui Tian looked at [Zhang Ga], walked up to him, and asked.
1:20:15|1:20:19|[Zhang Ga] struggled to resist, but was firmly held by two pseudo-soldiers.
1:20:25|1:20:29|Hey, there's a rebellion in the office being translated here.
1:20:54|1:21:1|The newcomer took off his hat and bowed, isn't this [Luo Jinbao]?
1:21:21|1:21:27|[Pang Dun] lit a cigarette for [Luo Jinbao].
1:22:3|1:22:13|[Luo Jinbao] nervously looked around and the two of them turned and entered the ceremonial hall, the screen went black.
1:22:13|1:22:17|In the early morning, car after car of grain is being transported to the enemy's stronghold.
1:22:27|1:22:33|In the prison cell, [Zhang Ga] is boredly drawing scenes of fighting the Japanese invaders on the wall with small stones.
1:22:33|1:22:39|Suddenly, hearing no sound, [Zhang Ga] quickly sat down.
1:22:39|1:22:45|The door opened, and a pseudo-soldier came in carrying food.
1:22:55|1:23:4|[Zhang Ga] picked up a steamed bun with his chopsticks and started chewing on it heartily.
1:23:4|1:23:9|Beside [Wei Jun], squatting on a stool.
1:23:32|1:23:39|The soldier tossed a box of matches to [Zhang Ga] and asked him to light his cigarette.
1:23:39|1:23:44|[Zhang Ga] stood up, pretended to light a cigarette, but actually stuck the match into the person's nostril.
1:23:49|1:23:54|The pseudo army was furious and almost picked up a chair to smash [Zhang Ga].
1:23:54|1:24:2|At this moment, outside the stronghold, [Luo Jinbao] is observing the situation of the stronghold on the river from a distance.
1:24:2|1:24:8|In the reed bushes beside, there are hidden boats of the Eighth Route Army, quiet and silent.
1:24:15|1:24:26|In the evening, several grain-carrying carts arrived at the front of the base, and the captain of the district team, dressed as an old farmer, walked up to the front.
1:24:46|1:24:53|Saying that, he threw a bunch of money up.
1:24:53|1:25:0|Zhang Ga smiled when Wei Jun moved.
1:25:1|1:25:4|[Pang Dun] also came to help secretly.
1:25:23|1:25:26|Captain Qu said to his subordinates.
1:25:37|1:25:41|The city gate opened, and the grain-carrying carriage came in.
1:25:52|1:25:59|Captain Qu approached the fake soldier and said.
1:25:59|1:26:3|The pseudo-soldier just took the cigarette, and the next second he was knocked unconscious by the district captain.
1:26:6|1:26:14|The guns were actually hidden under the food, and the soldiers armed themselves, ready for battle.
1:26:14|1:26:22|Captain Qu walked forward and encountered a pair of Japanese soldiers. When the soldiers shone a flashlight, they only saw a vague figure and one of them asked loudly.
1:26:35|1:26:57|The battle began, with several signal flares streaking across the sky illuminating the entire sky. [Luo Jinbao], who was ambushed in the reeds, received the signal and led the team to advance towards the stronghold.
1:26:57|1:27:13|In the midst of intense gunfire, [Zhang Ga] awakens in the cell, nervously looking outside through the bars as the Eighth Route Army soldiers carry hay and rush into the stronghold.
1:27:13|1:27:18|The enemies were awakened one by one from their sleep, and the pseudo army captain didn't have time to put on his clothes.
1:27:20|1:27:37|[Gui Tian] pulled out his military knife, concentrating all his strength on a watchtower. The pseudo soldiers responsible for guarding the pole also brought it over.
1:27:41|1:27:58|In the building, [Gui Tian] and the fake army captain went upstairs, but they kicked the fake soldier who was supposed to guard [Zhang Ga] down the stairs, leaving him to fend for himself.
1:27:58|1:28:2|The pseudo-soldier fell down and saw [Zhang Ga] mocking him, feeling furious.
1:28:13|1:28:37|When the gunfire sounded, the pseudo army cowered in a small corner, even turning off the lights. Meanwhile, Zhang Ga climbed up the ladder with great joy, looking out from the small window of the watchtower, excitedly observing the battle outside.
1:28:37|1:28:42|Over here, a group led by [Luo Jinbao] has already located the place where Captain Zhong is being held captive.
1:28:51|1:29:7|[Luo Jinbao] shot and killed the guard with two shots, rescuing the company commander.
1:29:7|1:29:11|At this moment, a group of people first broke into the outer city wall and seized the high ground.
1:29:19|1:29:30|At the same time, another Eighth Route Army squad passed through the gate and captured the city wall from another direction.
1:29:30|1:29:39|The third squad arrived at the location marked by the area captain, bringing several buckets of kerosene. One person ran up to the area captain and reported.
1:30:3|1:30:15|Several Eighth Route Army soldiers carrying firewood and kerosene tried to get close to [Ganglou], but the enemy's firepower was too strong, and the soldiers who rushed out fell down one after another.
1:30:15|1:30:26|The thick-walled [Kuaiban performer] saw this scene and was extremely anxious, wanting to personally intervene.
1:30:26|1:30:32|Several people spread a quilt over him, poured soil and water on top, and then covered it with another quilt.
1:30:35|1:30:45|[Zhang Ga] in a cotton quilted fast board wants to rush out from the earthen wall, but is forced back by the shells. He seizes the opportunity and goes up again.
1:30:45|1:30:54|An explosion of a shell in front of Zhang Ga, Luo Jinbao, Gui Tian, and Pang Dun, making everyone tense up.
1:30:54|1:31:0|In the dark night, Zhang Ga agilely got up and rushed over to light the firewood around the harbor building.
1:31:5|1:31:9|Then quickly returned to the safe zone.
1:31:9|1:31:15|Captain Xu is very happy.
1:31:15|1:31:29|In the watchtower, [Zhang Ga] and Weijun were coughing from the smoke, when suddenly they heard someone shouting.
1:31:29|1:31:30|Captain Liu Xiang, report in quickly.
1:31:38|1:31:50|Suddenly, the fire in the gang building was extinguished by a hand grenade. Quick-witted Liu wanted to charge again, but he was stopped by the enemy's fierce firepower, as ordered by the platoon leader.
1:32:3|1:32:19|At this moment, in the watchtower, [Zhang Ga] took advantage of the fake king's distraction and quietly moved behind him, knocking him unconscious with a stool.
1:32:19|1:32:28|[Zhang Ga] took out a box of matches from the pseudo king's pocket, and then removed the kerosene lamp from the top of his head.
1:33:2|1:33:16|Outside, Captain Zhang Ga looked very surprised.
1:33:16|1:33:27|The person who is throwing firewood into the fire is [Luo Jinbao].
1:33:27|1:33:36|A raging fire broke out in the gang building, causing chaos among the enemies.
1:33:36|1:33:42|[Zhang Ga] looked at their flustered appearance and felt extremely happy.
1:33:42|1:33:46|The American army captain reported to the old [Gui Tian] in a state of collapse.
1:34:0|1:34:17|The enemy, helpless, rushed out of the watchtower, only to be surrounded by the torches of the Eighth Route Army.
1:34:17|1:34:22|In the raging fire, [Zhang Ga] kept throwing firewood into it over and over again.
1:34:28|1:34:38|When he finally rushed out of the fire, suddenly a gun was pointed at him, and he fell to the ground.
1:34:38|1:34:44|Liu rushed out again wrapped in a quilt.
1:34:44|1:34:53|He picked up the fallen corpse on the ground and rushed back through the dense gunfire.
1:35:2|1:35:7|He ran up to [Luo Jinbao].
1:35:15|1:35:19|The people around were so excited that tears welled up in their eyes.
1:35:19|1:35:24|Captain Qu tightly embraced [Luo Jinbao].
1:35:33|1:35:36|With a bang, the entire harbor building was blown up.
1:35:36|1:35:51|The battle was won, and the villagers were beating drums and gongs to welcome the victorious soldiers back.
1:35:51|1:35:55|The soldiers sat in the boat, excitedly waving to the people on both banks.
1:35:58|1:36:9|On the shore, the common people are holding a basket, which is filled with their own food to be offered to the Eighth Route Army soldiers.
1:36:9|1:36:22|The boat docked, [Zhang Ga] stepped ashore, handed Gui Tian's military knife to the medic, and then turned and ran away.
1:36:22|1:36:24|Chun Gang saw Captain Zhong and excitedly clenched his injured hand.
1:36:49|1:36:55|Our little hero Zhang Ga was still thinking about the precious autograph he had hidden in the bird's nest on the tree.
1:36:57|1:37:2|At the celebration banquet, Zhang Ga is toasting to the district captain and the Eighth Route Army soldiers.
1:37:25|1:37:31|[Zhang Ga] suddenly came back, he pulled the team leader aside and spoke earnestly with his head down.
1:37:57|1:38:18|Yang Xiaogen took out a gun holster from his bag and Captain Qu put the gun into the holster.
1:38:18|1:38:22|[Zhang Ga] was overjoyed and took the gun, slinging it over his shoulder.
1:38:33|1:38:42|The old Zhongshu held Zhang Ga, then took out something from his pocket and mysteriously placed it in Zhang Ga's palm. Zhang Ga opened his hand to take a look.
1:38:52|1:39:10|[Zhang Ga] joyfully threw himself into Uncle Chungang's arms, and Uncle Chungang was overjoyed and wept.
1:39:10|1:39:16|[Zhang Ga] rushed over to Uncle Man, and as he turned around, Yuying arrived.
1:39:25|1:39:31|The voiceover girl gives the shoes to [Zhang Ga].
1:39:31|1:39:38|[Zhang Ga] hung the shoes around his neck directly, and the voiceover wanted to give him eggs. [Zhang Ga] only took two and then turned and ran away.
1:39:48|1:39:58|[Zhang Ga] casually pointed in a direction, hung his shoes on the janitor's shoulder, then ran over to [Luo Jinbao] to try to stuff two eggs into Old Luo's hands.
1:39:58|1:40:5|[Zhang Ga] returned to the side of the district captain and took the steamed bun handed to him by the old lady.
1:40:5|1:40:9|At this moment, [Pang Dun] ran over with his string of firecrackers, and [Zhang Ga] went to meet him.
1:40:17|1:40:37|[Zhang Ga] took the firecrackers, suddenly seemed to remember something, pulled out a real gun from his waist, then handed the wooden gun to [Pang Dun], and [Pang Dun] saluted [Zhang Ga].
