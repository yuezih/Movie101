0:0:57|0:1:5|Accompanied by Sheng Nan's singing, the scene begins to show his journey to Beijing alone to pursue his dreams after bidding farewell to his girlfriend.
0:1:5|0:1:8|Although he has encountered setbacks in his age, he has never given up.
0:1:8|0:1:14|Whether it's morning or night, you can always see him singing freely with his guitar on the overpass.
0:1:14|0:1:20|Occasionally lost and confused, he would think back to the wonderful love of his student days, remembering the girl named [Bai Jing].
0:1:26|0:1:31|In the underground passage, a man walked past [Sheng Nan] and [Yang Yang], dropping a coin.
0:1:31|0:1:37|Yang Yang picked it up and expressed gratitude, while [Sheng Nan] next to her leaned in.
0:2:16|0:2:19|[Sheng Nan] gave all her change to [Yang Yang], but [Yang Yang] just casually threw it on the ground.
0:2:46|0:2:49|[Sheng Nan] turned around and put the guitar into the box.
0:2:49|0:2:54|After [Yang Yang] neatly arranged the money on the ground, she carefully scrutinized [Sheng Nan].
0:2:54|0:2:59|After fastening the buttons on the guitar case, [Sheng Nan] turned around, only to find [Yang Yang] staring at him motionlessly.
0:3:5|0:3:9|[Sheng Nan] got up and left, [Yang Yang] picked up the money and immediately followed.
0:3:9|0:3:14|Upon hearing [Yang Yang] catching up, [Sheng Nan] stopped and turned around to speak to him.
0:3:15|0:3:24|After speaking, [Sheng Nan] accelerated and walked forward, leaving Yang Yang standing still, looking ahead with a reluctant expression.
0:3:24|0:3:34|He slowly walked back to his original spot and sat down. After thinking for a while while looking at the money in his arms, he took out the pendant hanging around his neck, which had a photo of him and his parents.
0:3:34|0:3:41|In the photo, [Ma Dongmei] is holding him, while [Ba Jing] stands beside him. The family is smiling happily.
0:3:41|0:3:44|Watching, [Yang Yang] choked up, recalling that experience.
0:3:51|0:4:1|After realizing she had been abandoned, [Yang Yang] cried in pain.
0:4:1|0:4:3|The camera cuts back to the underground passage.
0:4:3|0:4:8|In [Yang Yang]'s choked voice, the scene gradually leads to the title of the movie "Dad is the Best in the World".
0:4:11|0:4:13|At the entrance of the bar, the boss taunted [Sheng Nan].
0:4:23|0:4:26|[Sheng Nan] looked at the boss, reluctant to leave.
0:4:26|0:4:32|The boss walked back to the bar disdainfully, and the camera cut to [Sheng Nan] applying for a job at another company.
0:4:42|0:4:51|After the female employee left, [Sheng Nan] sat down slowly, nervously looking at the original record in her hand, then gazing into the distance.
0:5:16|0:5:21|The director turned his head and pondered for a moment, then pointed at the female employee.
0:5:22|0:5:28|The female employee stuck out her tongue and whispered.
0:5:38|0:5:40|Sheng Nan pushed the record over.
0:5:50|0:5:57|Lian Songke went to sell roast duck, [Sheng Nan] awkwardly smiled.
0:6:14|0:6:20|The female employee saw a photo of [Sheng Nan] and [Yang Yang] together online.
0:6:20|0:6:26|After watching [Sheng Nan] leave, the director turned around and threw the record with the original song to the female employee.
0:6:30|0:6:37|The female employee picked up the record, checked to make sure the director had left, and then secretly hid the record in her own bag.
0:6:37|0:6:40|The scene shifts, [Sheng Nan] comes to participate in the music program.
0:7:37|0:7:42|Sheng Nan looked a little confused, but still nodded and then turned around and left.
0:7:42|0:7:43|Another contestant pushes the door open.
0:7:58|0:8:6|The scene shifts to an underground passage, where passersby are chatting and laughing. [Yang Yang] is leaning against the wall, asleep with a few coins in hand.
0:8:6|0:8:18|Sheng Nan, who was walking by, slowly stopped in his tracks when he saw Yang Yang. After a moment of contemplation, he shook his head, then bent down to place the guitar and food he was holding on the ground before walking over to Yang Yang.
0:8:18|0:8:26|Looking at the already asleep Yang Yang, he took off his coat, adjusted the angle, and squatted down to gently drape it over Yang Yang.
0:8:28|0:8:32|This scene was captured by the woman across with a camera.
0:8:32|0:8:37|After putting it on, [Sheng Nan] continued to squat beside [Yang Yang], adjusting the position of the clothes.
0:8:37|0:8:38|[Yang Yang] slowly woke up.
0:9:0|0:9:5|[Sheng Nan] sat down and handed the food to [Yang Yang].
0:9:5|0:9:9|[Sheng Nan] happily took the food, but didn't know how to open it.
0:9:9|0:9:12|[Sheng Nan] rushed forward when she saw the situation and helped her open it.
0:9:12|0:9:19|The woman across the street continued to film the actions of the two, adjusting the camera settings and then pressing the shutter.
0:9:19|0:9:24|Finally opening the bag, [Yang Yang] started eating voraciously.
0:9:42|0:9:47|[Yang Yang] placed the food on her lap, took out a pendant, and handed her parents' photo to [Sheng Nan] to look at.
0:10:20|0:10:23|Both of them had happy smiles on their faces.
0:10:23|0:10:30|[Sheng Nan] turned around and picked up the guitar case next to her, opened it, and inside was a brand new guitar.
0:10:30|0:10:38|He carefully took out the guitar and placed it on his body, then put on the strap, adjusted his posture, and started singing and playing.
0:10:38|0:10:45|He turned around and looked at [Yang Yang], who was eating something contentedly while looking at [Sheng Nan].
0:10:45|0:10:47|The woman across the street quickly pressed the shutter button to take another photo.
0:10:54|0:11:24|The destined starry sky blooms with smiles, holding the excitement in hand, with only you in the eyes shedding tears or emptiness as a form of relaxation. In [Sheng Nan]'s girlfriend [Bai Jing]'s side, her best friend is introducing the older man next to her and instilling different ideas into him.
0:11:24|0:11:26|Bai Jing thoughtfully pondered for a moment.
0:12:21|0:12:26|The scene shifts to Sheng Nan's home, where Sheng Nan's mother is crying while looking at a photo of Sheng Nan.
0:13:15|0:13:19|[Yang Yang]'s mother glared angrily at [Yang Yang]'s father, then said helplessly.
0:13:19|0:13:21|[Yang Yang]'s father poured out the wine bottle.
0:13:39|0:13:45|In the underground passage, [Sheng Nan] is preparing to take [Yang Yang] to the orphanage.
0:14:22|0:14:26|Sheng Nan, who was about to leave, hesitated for a moment upon hearing this, but ultimately stopped and left.
0:14:26|0:14:29|The beggar next to them cursed.
0:14:29|0:14:33|He threw the water bottle in his hand aside and looked at [Sheng Nan] indignantly.
0:14:33|0:14:40|In the bustling street, [Sheng Nan] began to recall the moments when [Yang Yang] treated him like a father figure, causing him to hesitate.
0:15:3|0:15:5|In the underground passage, [Yang Yang] mutters to himself.
0:15:51|0:15:56|[Sheng Nan] brought [Yang Yang] to his residence, surrounded by rows of small bungalows.
0:15:56|0:15:59|He picked up the key and opened a room door.
0:15:59|0:16:3|Night falls, [Yang Yang] sits on the bed while [Sheng Nan] is doing the laundry for her.
0:16:12|0:16:19|[Sheng Nan] lay on the bed with a yogurt in hand, excitedly tossing and turning, then noticed a quiet photo on the bedside.
0:16:24|0:16:27|Sheng Nan smiled and hung up her clothes.
0:16:49|0:16:54|The scene shifts, with [Bai Jing] sitting at a restaurant with a foreign man.
0:16:54|0:16:59|The man was staring blankly at [Bai Jing], while [Bai Jing] awkwardly smiled.
0:17:8|0:17:16|The man took out a bottle of eye drops from his bag and put some in his eyes. [Bai Jing] looked at him in surprise.
0:17:32|0:17:34|[Bai Jing] saw that he had guessed everything correctly, and she couldn't help but smile.
0:17:57|0:18:1|The bustling street was filled with traffic, while [Sheng Nan] continued to sing in the underground passage.
0:19:50|0:20:9|Deep in thought, Sheng Nan suddenly took out a ring from his bag, along with various pieces of evidence, cards, one million, and a villa, and got into the car.
0:20:13|0:20:18|The man pointed outside the window, where a convertible sports car was parked not far away.
0:20:18|0:20:27|[Bai Jing] followed the man's gaze and saw the sports car. She lowered her head and started to think, while the man continued to stare at her without moving.
0:20:35|0:20:39|[Bai Jing] looks a bit stunned.
0:20:45|0:20:46|Bai Jing hesitated a bit.
0:21:24|0:21:31|He glanced at the sports car outside the window, then at the bank card and keys on the table, and lowered his head to contemplate once again.
0:21:31|0:21:36|After thinking for a long time, [Bai Jing] finally looked up at the opposite side, but there was no one there.
0:21:36|0:21:41|[Bai Jing] turned around only to find that the man had already ridden his bicycle outside the window, ready to leave.
0:21:50|0:21:55|The man gave a thumbs-up to [Bai Jing], pointed at the sports car, and then rode away on the bike.
0:21:55|0:22:5|On the other side, [Sheng Nan] and [Yang Yang] are walking on the street, playing and having fun together.
0:22:5|0:22:14|A sports car slowly drove into the luxury villa area, the driver clumsily stepped on the brake but didn't stop smoothly, moving forward a short distance before coming to a halt.
0:22:15|0:22:23|[Bai Jing] got out of the driver's seat, she dressed up exquisitely and beautifully today, a departure from her usual plain attire.
0:22:23|0:22:35|Looking at the buildings in front of her, [Sheng Nan] seemed lost in thought. When she reached a door, she stopped and looked around.
0:22:35|0:22:37|[Bai Jing] takes out her phone from her bag and answers the call.
0:22:53|0:23:5|After speaking, [Bai Jing] hung up the phone, but soon a new call came in.
0:23:5|0:23:9|After hearing the voice, [Bai Jing] paused for a moment, then hesitantly spoke.
0:23:20|0:23:24|[Sheng Nan] hesitated for a moment, hesitantly reached out and touched Yang Yang's head.
0:23:24|0:23:30|Later, she turned and walked to the edge of the bridge, and only whispered after making sure Yang Yang couldn't hear.
0:23:51|0:23:55|After hanging up the phone, he looked into the distance in confusion, and [Yang Yang] came up behind him.
0:24:13|0:24:15|[Sheng Nan] lowered her head.
0:24:37|0:24:40|He placed Yang Yang's hand properly and covered him with a blanket.
0:24:40|0:24:42|Yang Yang yawned sleepily.
0:24:47|0:24:50|Sheng Nan stood by the bed for a long time before turning and leaving.
0:24:50|0:24:54|While [Yang Yang] appeared to be sound asleep, she was actually pretending.
0:24:54|0:25:4|Upon hearing [Sheng Nan] leave, [Yang Yang] opened her eyes, got out of bed, put on her clothes and shoes, walked to the washbasin, and started washing the clothes that [Sheng Nan] hadn't had a chance to clean.
0:25:4|0:25:11|He clumsily sat on a small stool, rolled up his sleeves and sprinkled some laundry detergent into the basin before starting to wash.
0:26:11|0:26:16|Upon returning home, [Yang Yang] was already fast asleep, but the dirty laundry in the basin had been washed.
0:26:16|0:26:23|The thin man smiled with relief, looking at the new dress he bought for [Yang Yang] in his hand, and then at the clothes [Yang Yang] had just washed for him.
0:26:32|0:26:38|In the underground passage, [Sheng Nan] continues to sing, while [Yang Yang] dances happily in her new dress beside her.
0:26:38|0:26:42|The short-haired woman continued to film everything and posted it online.
0:26:42|0:26:47|The female employee of the record company happened to see this video clip and immediately called the music teacher.
0:26:55|0:26:58|Suddenly someone shouted that the urban management officers were coming, and [Sheng Nan] quickly left with [Yang Yang].
0:28:4|0:28:8|[Sheng Nan] smiled and [Yang Yang] fed him the candied hawthorn on a stick.
0:28:8|0:28:14|She took a satisfied bite, the camera then turned to [Bai Jing], who was on a date with her foreign boyfriend at the coffee shop.
0:28:14|0:28:25|The man teased her and touched [Bai Jing]'s hand, making [Bai Jing] shyly smile.
0:28:25|0:28:27|[Bai Jing] glanced at her boyfriend and whispered to the side.
0:28:41|0:28:48|After hanging up the phone, [Bai Jing] smiled but looked somewhat unnaturally at her boyfriend.
0:28:48|0:28:49|The camera cuts to the cafeteria.
0:29:7|0:29:11|[Bai Jing] smiled and nodded, while [Sheng Nan] lowered her head in silence.
0:29:29|0:29:33|The couple at the next table were chatting animatedly, while they sat there awkwardly.
0:29:46|0:29:54|[Sheng Nan] avoided everything in front of her by eating, chewing and swallowing slowly. [Bai Jing] looked at her somewhat at a loss.
0:29:54|0:30:1|After thinking for a moment with her head down, she picked up the bag on the table and took out some money from it, placing it on the table.
0:30:1|0:30:8|[Sheng Nan] ignored it and kept eating with her head down, while [Bai Jing] slowly pushed the money over.
0:30:17|0:30:26|[Sheng Nan] stared blankly at the food in front of her without saying a word, while [Bai Jing] finished speaking and then got up and left, leaving [Sheng Nan] sitting there alone.
0:30:26|0:30:35|After [Bai Jing] walked away, [Sheng Nan] continued to eat in silence, using this method to ease her embarrassment and vent her grievances and unwillingness.
0:30:35|0:30:44|After dinner, [Sheng Nan] once again boarded the train back to Beijing alone. Sitting across from a couple who were intimate with each other, she looked out the window at the scenery alone.
0:30:53|0:31:0|The scene cuts to an office where a woman throws a file directly onto the man's head.
0:31:0|0:31:8|The woman looked at the man defiantly, the man angrily pointed a small knife at the woman, and then calmed down.
0:31:53|0:31:56|[Sheng Nan] angrily left, leaving the man standing there awkwardly.
0:32:5|0:32:8|Except for [Sheng Nan], who came to the underground passage in a daze.
0:32:8|0:32:10|But when walking down, [Sheng Nan] tripped over her foot.
0:32:10|0:32:16|He turned around, angrily kicked the step, then straightened up and continued walking forward.
0:32:35|0:32:38|[Sheng Nan] sat in the underground passage, singing a song attentively.
0:32:38|0:32:41|[Sheng Nan] walked forward gracefully and confidently.
0:32:41|0:32:48|After walking for a long time, she stumbled over to sit down next to [Sheng Nan] against the wall.
0:32:48|0:32:52|[Sheng Nan] saw a woman suddenly sitting next to her, so she stopped and looked at her.
0:32:52|0:32:54|[Sheng Nan] said dazedly.
0:32:59|0:33:4|[Chuchu] looked somewhat disdainful, turned around and rummaged through her bag, while [Sheng Nan] turned around and played with the formation.
0:33:4|0:33:10|Later, [Chuchu] took out a hundred yuan bill from her bag and placed it in front of [Sheng Nan], saying arrogantly.
0:33:13|0:33:16|[Sheng Nan] glanced at it and returned the money.
0:33:18|0:33:23|[Chuchu] rolled her eyes, took out a few more from her bag, and threw them on [Sheng Nan].
0:33:28|0:33:36|[Sheng Nan] first smiled, then sighed, and proceeded to neatly organize the money before putting it back on [Yang Yang].
0:33:36|0:33:51|[Chu Chu] leaned against the wall with her eyes closed, looking completely indifferent.
0:33:51|0:33:55|The scene cuts to [Sheng Nan], who has already taken [Chuchu] back home.
0:33:55|0:33:57|[Chuchu] is lying on the sofa, calling out someone else's name.
0:33:58|0:34:4|He carefully unfolded the blanket, gently removed [Yang Yang]'s feet from the sofa, and covered [Yang Yang] with the blanket.
0:34:4|0:34:9|Later, he turned his back to the sofa, picked up a pen, and wrote a few words for [Chuchu].
0:34:9|0:34:15|Before leaving, he didn't forget to tuck in the blanket for [Chuchu], and only after everything was settled did [Sheng Nan] leave with peace of mind.
0:34:16|0:34:42|Sheng Nan blossoms with a smile in her eyes, her hand holding onto the excitement, not moving in the smoke, tears flowing as she switches time and space as a form of indulgence. The neon lights of someone's maze can't reach you. Meanwhile, Yang Yang has already started kindergarten.
0:34:42|0:34:46|The teachers are having the children form a circle and teaching them to sing.
0:34:46|0:34:58|Yang You rests his chin on his hands, swaying his body along with the singing.
0:34:58|0:35:0|The scene shifts to the music company.
0:35:4|0:35:5|Sheng Nan came to the kindergarten to pick up Yang Yang.
0:36:37|0:36:43|After that, the two of them left. The scene then cuts to [Chuchu]'s home, where [Chuchu] is reading the letter left by [Sheng Nan].
0:36:49|0:36:53|He was sitting slanted on the sofa, with his feet propped up on the coffee table in front.
0:36:53|0:37:0|After reading the letter, [Sheng Nan] smiled and took a bite of the apple, then looked ahead, planning something thoughtfully.
0:37:0|0:37:7|[Sheng Nan] and Xiao Wen arrived at the door of the classroom, where they saw [Yang Yang] happily playing with toys. Finally, [Sheng Nan] made a decision.
0:38:21|0:38:26|Sheng Nan smiled and patted Yang Yang's head, but a few strands of hair fell down.
0:38:35|0:38:40|In the dead of night, [Yang Yang] was already fast asleep, while [Sheng Nan] was about to start writing a song.
0:38:40|0:38:47|To avoid disturbing Yang Yang's rest, Sheng Nan sat aside with a small desk lamp on, twirling the pen tip and pondering the lyrics.
0:38:47|0:38:50|Discovering [Yang Yang] turning over, he still remembers to cover [Yang Yang] with the blanket.
0:39:37|0:39:45|He thought and thought, and then remembered the beautiful love with [Bai Jing] during their university days.
0:40:7|0:40:12|Although these experiences are vivid in her memory, [Bai Jing] has already distanced herself from them.
0:40:12|0:40:17|But [Sheng Nan] was still the same person who used to dare to chase her dreams and refused to give up.
0:40:17|0:40:21|She wrote "I Am Still Me" in her notebook.
0:40:21|0:40:24|In the blink of an eye, the paper was filled with writing by [Sheng Nan].
0:40:24|0:40:26|She organized the lyrics and completed the creation.
0:40:29|0:40:46|The camera moves to the underground passage, with [Sheng Nan] singing the new song she wrote while continuing to reminisce about the military training.
0:40:46|0:40:54|At this moment, [Chuchu] also arrived next to [Sheng Nan].
0:40:55|0:40:56|Quietly listening to [Sheng Nan] sing.
0:41:45|0:41:49|The skinny man stopped and looked at [Chu Chu] next to him, who smiled and said.
0:42:12|0:42:17|[Sheng Nan] picked up the guitar and started singing, while [Yang Yang] listened attentively beside her.
0:42:56|0:43:2|The scene shifts to the villa of [Chu Chu], where [Sheng Nan] is sitting on the sofa, anxiously waiting.
0:43:2|0:43:7|[Sheng Nan] walked down from upstairs slowly and picked up an apple casually.
0:43:7|0:43:11|After walking up to [Sheng Nan], [Chuchu] placed her other hand on [Sheng Nan]'s shoulder and sat down.
0:43:47|0:43:51|[Sheng Nan] took a bite of the apple, looked to the side, and pondered for a moment.
0:44:8|0:44:15|[Sheng Nan] decisively left, [Yang Yang] threw the apple in her hand towards [Sheng Nan], and sat gloomily on the sofa.
0:44:15|0:44:22|The scene shifts to a restaurant, with [Yang Yang] and [Xiao Wen] sitting in a row, while [Sheng Nan] sits opposite them, watching. There are three bowls of noodles on the table.
0:44:39|0:44:40|[Sheng Nan] said with embarrassment.
0:44:40|0:44:42|[Xiao Wen] gave her a glare.
0:44:50|0:44:55|Yang Yang next to her hasn't touched her noodles for a long time, Xiao Wen leaned over.
0:45:55|0:45:59|[Doctor] cleans up [Yang Yang]'s forehead, and [Yang Yang] falls asleep leaning on his chest.
0:46:14|0:46:16|[Xiao Wen] patted [Yang Yang]'s shoulder and said.
0:46:23|0:46:30|Xiao Wen smiled and said, "Don't worry, little guy." Then they got up and left.
0:46:36|0:46:41|The backs of the three figures gradually blur, and the camera then turns to the inside of the kindergarten classroom.
0:46:41|0:46:44|The children are divided into several groups, all busy learning to draw.
0:46:44|0:46:48|Xiao Wen sat in [Yang Yang]'s group, patiently teaching them how to draw.
0:46:48|0:46:49|[Sheng Nan] is also studying diligently.
0:46:56|0:47:3|On this side of the underground passage, [Sheng Nan] continued to sing her newly written song, while not far away, the short-haired woman was still capturing these scenes.
0:47:37|0:47:41|The skinny man sings while recalling various people and events he has encountered recently.
0:47:41|0:47:51|He remembered Xiao Wen standing in front of the classroom door, telling him she had decided to be Yang Yang's mother, and also thought of Bai Jing sitting next to him listening to him sing.
0:48:5|0:48:12|The skinny man took out his phone to answer the call, while on the other end, Xiao Wen was anxiously calling him.
0:48:40|0:48:42|The director next to them made an OK gesture.
0:48:51|0:48:54|The director made a gesture and then happily danced away.
0:48:58|0:49:4|[Sheng Nan] walked anxiously on the street, when suddenly, her phone rang again. She quickly answered it.
0:49:9|0:49:13|[Sheng Nan] turned and jogged away, while dialing a phone number.
0:49:28|0:49:29|The doctor walked out of the ward.
0:49:50|0:49:55|The scene shifts to Yang Yang's hospital bed, and Sheng Nan begins to recall the words the doctor just said.
0:50:17|0:50:21|[Sheng Nan] stood in front of the doctor, unable to believe all of this.
0:50:21|0:50:25|The camera cuts back to Sheng Nan standing by Yang Yang's hospital bed, staring blankly at him.
0:50:25|0:50:40|Beside her, Xiao Wen glanced over and turned to ask. Sheng Nan pointed outside and left. Xiao Wen looked at Yang Yang and followed suit, leaving only Yang Yang asleep on the hospital bed.
0:50:40|0:50:45|Outside the ward, [Sheng Nan] took out the diagnosis report and handed it to Xiao Wen.
0:50:47|0:50:53|After watching it, Xiao Wen couldn't believe everything in front of her, and [Sheng Nan] beside her had already cried her eyes red.
0:50:53|0:51:1|In the hospital room, [Yang Yang] continued to sleep soundly, while outside Xiao Wen had already cried her eyes out, helplessly leaning on [Sheng Nan]'s shoulder.
0:51:1|0:51:8|At this moment, [Yang Yang] on the sickbed slowly woke up. When she became clear-headed, she looked around but didn't see anyone nearby.
0:51:8|0:51:13|Feeling helpless, she thought she had been abandoned by her parents again, so she cried in pain.
0:52:16|0:52:20|After speaking, Sheng Nan stood up and left, walking quietly through the hospital corridor.
0:52:24|0:52:27|The scene shifts to [Sheng Nan]'s home, where she goes to answer the doorbell.
0:52:31|0:52:35|Upon seeing [Sheng Nan], she grabbed the other person's hand and walked towards the living room.
0:52:47|0:52:48|[Chuchu] held [Sheng Nan]'s hand.
0:52:53|0:52:57|Chuchu's smile disappeared from her face as she let go of Sheng Nan's hand.
0:53:13|0:53:16|[Chuchu] grabbed [Sheng Nan]'s hand again, but was pushed away.
0:53:23|0:53:26|[Chuchu] slapped [Sheng Nan] in the face, but soon regretted it.
0:53:39|0:53:41|[Sheng Nan] once again pulls [Chuchu]'s hand away.
0:53:50|0:53:58|Sheng Nan left angrily, [Yang Yang] sat on the sofa, and the little dog on the ground looked innocently ahead.
0:53:58|0:54:5|The camera cuts to the hospital room, with [Yang Yang] lying on the bed. [Xiao Wen] looks at [Yang Yang], then helplessly glances at Sheng Nan.
0:54:5|0:54:9|At this moment, [Yang Yang] slowly opened her eyes and looked towards Sheng Nan beside her.
0:54:9|0:54:12|Sheng Nan quickly approached after discovering.
0:54:26|0:54:28|Glancing at [Xiao Wen], [Sheng Nan] then looked at [Yang Yang].
0:54:44|0:54:48|Sheng Nan cleaned up Yang Yang's cheeks, put on her coat, and then left.
0:54:58|0:55:1|[Xiao Wen] picked up an apple and started peeling it for [Yang Yang].
0:55:1|0:55:6|On the other side, Sheng Nan brought a poster from the Tower Dormitory to the skywalk and started putting it up everywhere.
0:55:33|0:55:43|The camera cuts back to [Yang Yang], as [Xiao Wen] peels a banana and brings it to [Yang Yang]. [Yang Yang] takes a bite, and they both laugh happily. At that moment, a nurse approaches.
0:55:57|0:56:7|After the nurse finished providing payment information and left, [Xiao Wen] first looked worried for a moment, then quickly adjusted her mood and continued to play with [Yang Yang].
0:56:7|0:56:13|[Sheng Nan] continued to post recruitment notices everywhere, his figure could be seen at subway stations and bus stops.
0:56:13|0:56:18|Back in the ward, after a busy day, [Xiao Wen] had already fallen asleep leaning on the table, while [Yang Yang] was also fast asleep.
0:56:20|0:56:25|The scene cuts to several days later, [Xiao Wen] sits alone outside the hospital room and dials [Sheng Nan]'s phone number.
0:56:47|0:56:56|After hanging up the phone, [Xiao Wen] sat outside the ward lost in thought, while Shou Nan leaned against the wall in the underground passage, recalling the doctor's words.
0:57:18|0:57:24|After Sheng Nan answered the phone, the camera cut to the hospital.
0:57:24|0:57:27|He placed a jar of money on the doctor's desk.
0:57:33|0:57:36|The doctor quickly stepped forward and helped [Sheng Nan] up.
0:58:15|0:58:22|[Sheng Nan] listened and was on the verge of collapse. He slowly squatted down, covered his face with his hands, and then stood up to leave.
0:58:22|0:58:27|The doctor next to him, [Jianzhuang], also sighed helplessly and shook his head.
0:58:27|0:58:33|The scene shifts to the hospital entrance, where [Sheng Nan] has composed herself and is coming out of the hospital holding [Yang Yang].
0:58:33|0:58:36|[Xiao Wen] then followed alongside with [Sheng Nan]'s guitar.
0:59:4|0:59:10|[Sheng Nan] held [Yang Yang] tightly, while [Xiao Wen] gently patted [Yang Yang]'s body before leaving.
0:59:10|0:59:16|Back at home, [Yang Yang] lay on the bed, looking at the new toy she bought, happily dancing with her hands and feet.
0:59:16|0:59:23|He picked up a beautiful [Yang Yang] style toy and started playing with it, sometimes putting the toy on himself and sometimes tossing it in the air.
0:59:23|0:59:29|It seems like all the worries have disappeared at this moment, with pouring rain outside, [Sheng Nan] and [Xiao Wen] standing together.
0:59:54|1:0:8|[Xiao Wen] turned her head slowly, looked up, opened the umbrella, turned around and left. The mood of the two also fell into the abyss with the pouring rain.
1:0:8|1:0:17|After [Xiao Wen] left, [Sheng Nan] walked away from the sheltered eaves and into the pouring rain. She leaned against the nearby fence, letting the rain wash over her face.
1:0:17|1:0:32|She slowly closed her eyes, digesting the negative emotions in her heart alone. After calming down for a while, [Sheng Nan] pushed open the door of the room and entered slowly, seeing [Yang Yang] already asleep. She gently closed the door again, and sat down by [Yang Yang]'s bed.
1:0:56|1:1:1|He looked up at [Yang Yang], then closed his eyes and began to recall all the moments he had experienced with [Yang Yang].
1:1:34|1:1:40|The night gradually brightened, and [Yang Yang] slowly woke up to see [Sheng Nan] sleeping on a bench. She quickly woke [Sheng Nan] up.
1:2:5|1:2:11|Sheng Nan got up, stretched, and picked up Yang Yang's clothes to help him put them on.
1:3:53|1:3:58|[Sheng Nan] lifted [Yang Yang] over her shoulder and carried him out of the house.
1:3:58|1:4:3|[Sheng Nan] is walking down the street, holding [Yang Yang] in her arms.
1:4:19|1:4:31|The two of them walked forward, dancing, temporarily forgetting all their worries, until they reached a street corner.
1:4:31|1:4:34|Their footsteps gradually slowed down, [Yang Yang] whispered.
1:4:36|1:4:51|The skinny man stopped and put down his guitar, squatting down to support [Yang Yang]'s arm, then gently rubbed [Yang Yang]'s face with concern, before slowly taking out a bottle of yogurt from his bag.
1:4:51|1:4:59|The skinny man inserted the straw and handed it to [Yang Yang], who took big sips.
1:4:59|1:5:2|The skinny man picked up [Yang Yang] and walked forward again with a guitar in his hand.
1:5:4|1:5:14|In the underground passage, [Sheng Nan] continues to sing and play the guitar, while [Yang Yang] sways to the rhythm beside her. On the wall behind them, there is a missing person notice for [Yang Yang], who is critically ill and searching for her parents.
1:6:25|1:6:36|In the underground passage, most of the vendors scattered, leaving only [Sheng Nan] and the beggar behind.
1:6:36|1:6:43|Three urban management officers slowly walked towards [Sheng Nan] and [Yang Yang].
1:6:43|1:6:45|Sheng Nan glanced down at Yang Yang.
1:6:47|1:6:58|One of the urban management officers noticed the missing person notice on the wall, and with a command, the other two also stepped forward to take a look.
1:6:58|1:7:3|Three urban management officers took out money from their pockets, and the short-haired woman immediately captured the scene.
1:7:14|1:7:23|After the urban management officers left, the short-haired woman who had been filming closed her camera and walked up to [Yang Yang], taking out several hundred yuan bills to hand to her.
1:7:25|1:7:34|The woman patted [Yang Yang]'s head and then left. The beggar across the street shook his head at the scene and looked back at his begging bowl.
1:7:34|1:7:37|Although there wasn't much money inside, she still walked up to [Yang Yang] with the basin.
1:7:38|1:7:43|Gave all the money in the basin to [Yang Yang], and patted [Yang Yang]'s head.
1:7:43|1:7:44|[Yang Yang] also smiled and thanked him.
1:7:49|1:7:52|The scene then shifts to a bridge.
1:8:10|1:8:15|[Sheng Nan] patted [Yang Yang]'s head, only to find that a few strands of hair came off in her hand.
1:8:15|1:8:22|He looked at his hand, thinking of [Yang Yang]'s worsening condition, and then sorrowfully held [Yang Yang] tightly in his arms.
1:8:28|1:8:35|[Sheng Nan] took [Yang Yang]'s hand and left, arriving at a restaurant where the table was filled with various dishes.
1:8:35|1:8:37|Sheng Nan and Yang Yang sit side by side.
1:8:45|1:8:51|[Yang Yang] picked up the chopsticks and started eating, while [Sheng Nan] picked up a piece of food for him and watched him silently.
1:8:51|1:8:58|[Yang Yang] saw it and also warmly leaned against [Sheng Nan], the two smiled at each other.
1:8:59|1:9:2|[Sheng Nan] was picking up dishes when she inadvertently saw [Chu Chu] drinking alone at the table.
1:9:36|1:9:40|[Chuchu] glared at [Sheng Nan], left a hundred yuan for the boss, and then turned and walked away.
1:9:40|1:9:44|Sheng Nan shook her head at her.
1:10:9|1:10:15|The camera cuts to a hotel, where [Yang Yang] excitedly runs in, followed by a thin man.
1:10:43|1:10:46|[Yang Yang] happily bounces around on the big bed.
1:10:46|1:10:51|In the amusement park, [Sheng Nan] held [Yang Yang] and stood with Xiao Wen to take a photo.
1:10:51|1:10:54|They also showed long-lost smiles on their faces.
1:10:54|1:10:59|Later, they explored all the various attractions inside with [Yang Yang].
1:11:33|1:11:36|As night fell, they arrived at the overpass to celebrate [Yang Yang]'s birthday.
1:11:50|1:12:0|[Sheng Nan] held [Yang Yang] in the middle, with a crown on his head, [Yang Yang] turned his head and kissed Xiao Wen, surrounded by a group of people singing and celebrating [Yang Yang]'s birthday.
1:12:0|1:12:6|They had someone holding a guitar, someone clapping their hands, all in their own way to make [Yang Yang] happy.
1:12:6|1:12:11|The camera slowly rises, with a huge birthday cake placed beside them.
1:12:11|1:12:18|The three urban management officers who had donated money to [Yang Yang] before were not far away, clapping their hands for [Yang Yang] and singing a birthday song for her with great care.
1:13:34|1:13:42|The scene cuts to the computer screen at the music company, where a female employee also sees the footage of everyone celebrating [Yang Yang]'s birthday online.
1:13:42|1:13:49|Just as she was feeling moved, the music director walked in with the contract.
1:13:51|1:14:1|[Sheng Nan] walked in slowly, placed a stack of money on the front desk, the manager glanced at the money and then at [Sheng Nan], and then said arrogantly.
1:14:16|1:14:20|The director was first a little surprised, and then said indifferently.
1:14:23|1:14:30|The director took the money and walked away. Sheng Nan glanced at him indifferently, looking very tired. The female employee smiled and nodded at Sheng Nan.
1:14:52|1:14:56|Sheng Nan responded and then turned around to leave.
1:14:56|1:15:10|The camera cuts to outside the house rented by [Sheng Nan]. After the landlord locks the door and leaves, [Sheng Nan] and Xiao Wen slowly walk forward with their luggage. However, after taking only a few steps, they stop. Xiao Wen speaks first with a heavy heart.
1:15:23|1:15:41|Sheng Nan was about to leave, but Xiao Wen couldn't bear it and grabbed Sheng Nan's arm. Sheng Nan slowly turned around, looking at Xiao Wen with a vacant expression. Xiao Wen gazed back at him firmly. After a long moment of eye contact, Sheng Nan took out a photo from his bag. Xiao Wen accepted the photo, and Sheng Nan then turned and walked away.
1:15:41|1:15:57|Only Xiao Wen was left standing alone in place, watching Sheng Nan leave in a daze. He then shifted his gaze to the photo, the camera slowly zooming in. It was a picture of them at the amusement park with [Bai Jing], their only remaining beautiful memory.
1:15:57|1:16:3|At this moment, even though [Yang Yang] is no longer in this world, their feelings for each other will always endure.
1:16:3|1:16:14|In the underground passage, [Yang Yang]'s mother walked forward slowly and helplessly, surrounded by a bustling crowd, but there was no one she cared about, and no one came to care for her.
1:16:14|1:16:20|When Bingling collapsed, he leaned against the wall of the underground passage, hitting his own head, and then burst into tears.
1:16:20|1:16:25|Before long, she accidentally saw a missing person notice posted on the wall.
1:16:25|1:16:30|Upon discovering the drawing of Yang Yang above, he eagerly tore down the missing person notice as if he had found a treasure.
1:16:30|1:16:34|After looking at it several times, it was finally confirmed that the information was about Yang Yang.
1:16:35|1:16:39|He put the missing person notice back in his arms and looked at it excitedly again and again.
1:16:39|1:16:43|After thinking for a while, he finally had a goal and left the underground passage.
1:16:43|1:16:47|The camera shifts to [Sheng Nan], who places the suitcase and guitar in front of him.
1:16:47|1:16:50|A person stands on a pedestrian bridge, staring blankly at the traffic flow in the distance.
1:17:4|1:17:8|[Sheng Nan] choked up, held back from saying a word, and hung up the phone. Seeing the other end remain silent and hang up, Yang Yang's mother finally realized that Yang Yang may have passed away.
1:17:34|1:17:43|He squatted down slowly, bent over, and started to cry uncontrollably next to the telephone booth, crushing the student inspiration in his hand into a ball.
1:17:43|1:17:55|Tears streamed down his face, turning [Yang Yang] into a permanent knot in his heart. At this moment, even if he regretted it again, he could not go back to the day they abandoned [Yang Yang], nor could he make the choice again.
1:17:56|1:17:59|[Sheng Nan] over here, she is about to leave.
1:17:59|1:18:2|Upon turning around, Sheng Nan found Xiao Wen standing in front of her.
1:18:2|1:18:5|They stood on the overpass, looking at each other for a long time.
1:18:5|1:18:8|In the end, Xiao Wen spoke up.
1:18:15|1:18:18|[Sheng Nan] sighed and looked into the distance.
1:18:27|1:18:31|The two turned around and looked at the man speaking.
1:18:37|1:18:40|[Xiao Wen] looked at [Sheng Nan], and [Sheng Nan] lowered her head.
1:19:1|1:19:10|The man took out a business card and handed it to [Sheng Nan], revealing that he was actually the boss behind the music company.
1:19:10|1:19:15|After speaking, the man turned and walked away. [Sheng Nan] glanced at the business card.
1:19:24|1:19:44|[Sheng Nan] and Xiao Wen watched the man walk away, then looked at each other. Sheng Nan turned to look at the traffic in the distance, while Xiao Wen walked over to stand side by side with him. After a long silence, Xiao Wen finally gathered the courage to hold Sheng Nan's hand. Sheng Nan did not refuse. They turned their heads and looked at each other.
1:19:44|1:19:49|At this moment, the camera slowly rises and pans towards the bustling streets of Beijing.
