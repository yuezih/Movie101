0:0:23|0:0:33|On a windy night in the month of May, a group of people holding torches were shouting loudly, chasing after a young couple holding a child ahead.
0:0:41|0:0:54|The young man furrowed his brows, looked down at the two children in his arms, and, seeing the approaching crowd, hurriedly handed one of the children to his wife.
0:0:54|0:1:1|The young man looked at everything in front of him, feeling a bit at a loss for a moment. The wife glanced at her husband, then at the child, and choked out, [Ma Dongmei].
0:1:3|0:1:13|The gears of destiny quietly turned at this moment, and 30 years had passed in the blink of an eye. The scene shifted to a picturesque village.
0:1:13|0:1:20|In the distance, the sound of singing came through, sung by a man wearing a white tank top, named [Zhu Xiangquan].
0:1:20|0:1:26|The man beside cleared his throat and spoke.
0:1:51|0:1:54|Qiaoxiu put down the basket in her hand and squatted down next to [Zhu Xiangquan].
0:1:54|0:1:59|On the other side, the smartly dressed female assistant [Cai Yafen] said to the boss [Zhao Yinquan].
0:2:6|0:2:11|Upon hearing this, [Cai Yafen] put away her smile and followed out the door, deep in thought.
0:2:11|0:2:15|In the meeting room, a well-dressed man handed the documents to [Cai Yafen] and said.
0:2:29|0:2:33|Villagers gather around the [village chief] to study the documents in front of them.
0:3:34|0:3:43|The scene shifts, with [Cai Yafen] wearing high heels, briskly following [Village Chief] towards the mountains, accompanied by two other personnel for an on-site inspection.
0:4:13|0:4:15|After the assessment, [Cai Yafen] returned home.
0:4:25|0:4:27|[Cai Yafen] hesitated for a moment, then continued speaking.
0:4:47|0:4:52|Cousin [Meimei] came down from upstairs and sat next to [Cai Yafen], speaking up.
0:5:15|0:5:19|In the village, [Zhu Xiangquan] ran to the door of a household and shouted.
0:6:8|0:6:11|He pouted with a look of grievance, slowly walking backwards.
0:6:11|0:6:16|[The Village Chief] watched him leave, then looked back at his own yard before leaving as well.
0:6:16|0:6:19|On the other side, [Cai Yafen] brought [Meimei] to the coffee shop.
0:6:42|0:6:45|[Meimei] looked at him helplessly and said.
0:6:51|0:6:55|Night falls, a woman walks towards the doorstep of [Zhu Xiangquan]'s house and shouts.
0:6:57|0:7:0|[Zhu Xiangquan] walked out with his mother.
0:7:7|0:7:10|Mom glanced at [Zhu Xiangquan] and walked towards the door.
0:7:10|0:7:13|[Zhu Xiangquan] could only return home with a look of unwillingness upon seeing the situation.
0:7:13|0:7:18|On the other side, [Cai Yafen] drove to a beautiful small villa.
0:7:18|0:7:20|This is the home of [Zhao Yinquan], he opened the door and said.
0:7:29|0:7:32|[Meimei] followed [Cai Yafen] into the room.
0:8:1|0:8:5|[Cai Yafen] watched as [Zhao Yingquan]'s mother left, gradually retracting her smile.
0:8:5|0:8:12|At this moment, [Zhao Yingquan] walked over.
0:8:12|0:8:18|[Zhao Yingquan] handed the tea to [Meimei] and looked at her, asking.
0:9:4|0:9:9|Seeing the two people chatting happily in front of her, [Cai Yafen] quickly sent [Zhao Yinquan] away.
0:9:9|0:9:15|Night falls, the scene shifts to [Zhu Xiangquan]'s home, where he is absent-mindedly having dinner with his mother on the kang.
0:9:15|0:9:25|The mother looked at [Zhu Xiangquan], who had a troubled expression on his face, sighed, then picked up some vegetables and put them in his bowl. Seeing him still looking troubled, she spoke up.
0:9:44|0:9:50|On the other side, the North Xinjiang Group, [Cai Yafen], leaned back in the chair, casually watching [Director Wang] beside her, and asked.
0:10:2|0:10:3|Director Wang looked at the tired [Cai Yafen] and said.
0:10:27|0:10:31|[Director Wang] stood up with crossed arms and said solemnly.
0:10:41|0:10:44|[Cai Yafen] stood up immediately and spoke.
0:11:14|0:11:24|While the two of them were secretly plotting, the simple-minded [Zhu Xiangquan] felt that he had been treated unfairly. So, single-mindedly, he went to the city to seek justice on his own.
0:11:24|0:11:26|Looking at the bustling and lively street in front of them.
0:11:26|0:11:31|[Zhuxiangquan], who doesn't know the way, is in trouble.
0:11:31|0:11:33|Unexpectedly, the passersby completely ignored him.
0:11:37|0:11:43|[Zhuxiang Quan] ignored him after asking twice in a row, and the journey to Beijiang Group was not as easy as he had imagined.
0:11:43|0:11:59|On the other side, the rural girl [Jiang Xiu] sat on a pile of soil, watching a number of excavators working simultaneously in front of her, burying tons of garbage, looking worried. The air was filled with dust, the sky turned gray, and garbage piled up all over the mountains, emitting a strong stench.
0:12:0|0:12:4|The once beautiful mountain valley has now become unrecognizable.
0:12:4|0:12:11|On the other side, [Zhu Xiangquan] from the Beijiang Group, who has not been found yet, is standing in front of the faucet, drinking water greedily.
0:12:11|0:12:19|After finishing the drink, [Ma Dongmei] unscrewed the plastic bottle in her hand, grabbed a bottle of water, then slung her backpack over her shoulder without stopping, and continued on her way.
0:12:19|0:12:26|In the library, [Meimei] is bowing her head and searching for books, but [Zhang Yingquan] suddenly walks out from behind the bookshelf and appears in front of her, whispering.
0:12:29|0:12:36|[Meimei] looked up and saw [Zhao Yingquan] with a surprised smile on his face, waving at her. She quickly put the book in her hand back on the shelf.
0:12:36|0:12:41|Glancing back at the unnoticed [Cai Yafen], she followed along, fidgeting with her hands and feet.
0:12:41|0:12:51|Sitting by the window, [Cai Yafen] was engrossed in reading a book when her phone rang. She picked it up and saw a message from [Meimei], saying she had to leave early due to something urgent.
0:12:51|0:12:57|Sitting by the window, [Cai Yafen] looked downstairs and was surprised to see [Meimei] and [Zhao Yingquan] walking out of the library gate hand in hand.
0:13:24|0:13:28|[Meimei] and [Zhao Yingquan] hit it off at first sight, and their feelings quickly escalate.
0:14:53|0:15:1|[Cai Yafen]'s actions received a round of applause. Late at night, [Zhao Yinquan] returned home and bowed his head to work diligently.
0:15:1|0:15:8|The mother stood at the door, looking at her son with a heart full of tenderness. She pushed the door open and walked in, then lowered her head to say to [Zhao Yinquan].
0:15:22|0:15:35|He looked at his son, hesitated to speak, rubbed his hands, sighed, but in the end, he didn't say anything. He turned around and walked towards the door. Halfway there, he stopped, turned back, and spoke to [Zhao Yinquan].
0:15:39|0:15:56|Upon hearing [Zhao Yinquan]'s words, the mother nodded with a smile, looked at her son who was still working, turned around and silently left. She paused at the door, glanced back inside for a moment, ultimately swallowed the words on the tip of her tongue, closed the door, and walked away.
0:15:56|0:16:9|Early the next morning, [Ma Dongmei] came downstairs with a package in her hands, looking troubled. She sat down next to her husband who was reading the newspaper in the living room. The man looked up at his wife and then his gaze fell on the package in her hands, and he asked in confusion.
0:17:10|0:17:15|On the other side of the company, [Zhang Yingquan] held the financial statements in his hand and said to [Cai Yafen].
0:17:36|0:17:38|[Zhao Yingquan] threw down the report in his hand and sighed.
0:18:3|0:18:6|Reluctant [Zhao Yinquan] pursed his lips and continued working.
0:18:6|0:18:12|On the other side, back in the office, [Cai Yafen] slammed the documents on the table and shouted at [Director Wang].
0:18:40|0:18:44|Hearing this, [Director Wang] was frightened and quickly walked forward.
0:18:44|0:18:51|Yafen, [Cai Yafen], with her eyes closed, looks impatient.
0:18:52|0:18:57|Director Wang looked at Cai Yafen, who had her eyes closed and remained silent, and after a moment of silence, he reluctantly spoke.
0:19:2|0:19:6|After speaking, [Director Wang] took three steps and turned back, unwilling to give up, and walked out.
0:19:6|0:19:16|[Cai Yafen] slowly raised her head and opened her eyes. As she walked out of the office, she stood up, picked up the phone on the desk, dialed a number, placed it against her ear, and patiently waited.
0:19:16|0:19:21|In the hospital on the other side, the telephone rings.
0:19:37|0:19:46|"Hello? [Cai Yafen] hesitated for a moment and then spoke."
0:19:46|0:19:56|After receiving the affirmative answer, [Cai Yafen] showed a strange smile, her eyes rolled, she snorted coldly, and her expression gradually became sinister, as if she was plotting something bad.
0:19:58|0:20:7|The scene cuts to the agreed day, a cruise ship slowly approaches from a distance, with [Meimei] and [Cai Yafen] standing at the front of the ship.
0:20:7|0:20:14|The boat quickly arrived at the shore, and the two got off the boat with the crowd and arrived at a temple.
0:20:14|0:20:26|In the temple filled with incense, [Meimei] and [Cai Yafen] approached a Buddha statue. They put their hands together, closed their eyes, silently prayed for their inner desires, bowed down, and then left.
0:20:28|0:20:32|Soon after, the two of them arrived at a stone carving, where a tour guide introduced.
0:20:53|0:20:56|With the sound of clicking cameras, the camera behind captured the scene of the tour guide with ulterior motives approaching [Meimei].
0:20:56|0:20:58|On the other side, [Zhu Xiangquan] arrived at the company's entrance.
0:21:25|0:21:28|[Caì Yāfēn] hurriedly arrived at the door.
0:22:3|0:22:7|[Cai Yafen] looked [Zhu Xiangquan] up and down, then furrowed her brows.
0:22:7|0:22:11|[Director Wang] took [Zhu Xiangquan] to the side and pointed at his nose, speaking.
0:22:38|0:22:48|Angry [Zhu Xiangquan] punched [Director Wang] in the face, while on the other side, [Zhao Yingquan] was still meditating in the car, unaware of what was happening. The driver looked at him and asked.
0:22:53|0:23:3|On the winding and twisting Yangchang Road, a car passing by raised the dust on the ground. Accompanied by the buzzing roar of the car, [Zhang Yingquan] arrived at Yanling Village.
0:23:6|0:23:18|The car stopped, and he walked to a small river, bent down to stir the water in the river, then cupped some water with his palm, sniffed it in front of his nose, and [赵颖权] frowned when he found the smell was off.
0:23:18|0:23:28|Suddenly hearing a buzzing sound in the distance, he looked over and saw a working excavator in the distant mountain valley, surrounded by large piles of garbage.
0:23:28|0:23:33|He stood up and walked towards the junkyard, entering the office where a staff member spoke to him.
0:23:47|0:23:52|Zhang Yingquan stood up after speaking, and with his hands behind his back, he pondered for a moment before speaking.
0:23:58|0:24:4|The foreman kept his head down in silence, [Zhang Yiquan] snorted coldly and turned away. Seeing this, the foreman lifted his head and spoke.
0:24:22|0:24:32|[Zhao Yingquan] looked at the person in charge angrily, then turned and walked towards the door without a word. When he reached the door, he turned back and pointed at the person in charge.
0:24:32|0:24:47|In the park on the other side, a man wearing sunglasses walked out from behind the rockery, stood still and waved to the side. Another man in a floral shirt walked out from behind the rockery, waved his hand, followed by three young men. He pointed to [Zhu Xiangquan] and spoke to the others.
0:24:50|0:24:55|The three young men who received the order turned and ran down to [Zhu Xiangquan], and spoke.
0:25:5|0:25:10|Several young men quickly gave [Zhu Xiangquan] a beating, leaving him writhing in pain on the ground.
0:25:10|0:25:14|Before long, an ambulance arrived and took him to the hospital.
0:25:14|0:25:20|He lay unconscious on the stretcher, and several medical staff pushed him into the operating room together.
0:25:20|0:25:27|The surgical light turned on, and the [doctor] put on gloves and picked up a scalpel, cutting off his hair to prepare for the skull surgery.
0:25:28|0:25:36|On the other side, [Zhao Yingquan] left Yanling Village and encountered a landslide on the way home, blocked by falling rocks from the mountain.
0:25:36|0:25:47|The car stopped, and [Zhao Yingquan] got out of the car with the driver to check the situation. Looking at the stones on the ground, he said to the driver.
0:25:47|0:25:55|[Zhao Yingquan] and the driver, both barefoot, lifted the stones together. Just as they finished clearing away the large rocks, Zhu Xiangquan's mother appeared.
0:25:56|0:26:2|She watched the falling rocks on the road, put down the basket in her hand, and also helped to move them.
0:26:2|0:26:5|As they were moving, Zhu Xiangquan's mother saw [Zhao Yingquan] in front of her.
0:26:5|0:26:10|She stared at [Zhao Yingquan] for a long time, and then spoke hesitantly.
0:26:10|0:26:15|Aquan, [Zhao Yingquan], looked at the woman in front of him with confusion.
0:26:33|0:26:37|Upon hearing this, the woman was dumbfounded and looked at [Zhao Yingquan] in disbelief.
0:26:54|0:26:57|He glanced at [Zhao Yingquan] again.
0:26:59|0:27:4|He stared at [Zhao Yingquan] with wide eyes.
0:27:17|0:27:20|He finished speaking and then left in a daze.
0:27:20|0:27:26|[Zhao Yingquan] watched his departing figure in confusion, then squatted down and picked up a stone.
0:27:26|0:27:33|Suddenly, a large rock fell from the mountain and hit him directly on the head.
0:27:33|0:27:43|Here, [Zhao Yingquan] was knocked unconscious by a stone, while in the hospital on the other side, Zhu Xiangquan, who had just undergone surgery, shaved his head bald, with bandages wrapped around his head, lying unconscious on the hospital bed.
0:27:45|0:27:58|As a nurse, [Meimei] entered the ward to change the medicine. Just after finishing, she turned around to leave, but accidentally saw the person on the bed. She immediately walked over, looked at the person on the bed in shock, widened her eyes, and quickly took off her mask.
0:28:2|0:28:5|After speaking, she hurried to the end of the bed to look at the medical record card.
0:28:5|0:28:12|The name column clearly wrote the two characters "阿全", mistakenly thinking that this person is [Zhao Yingquan]'s Meimei, now in a panic.
0:28:12|0:28:22|Worried Meimei came to the rooftop and took out her phone. She dialed the number of Cai Yafen at the company and spoke with a serious expression on her face.
0:28:40|0:28:46|[Cai Yafen] frowned, looking at [Zhu Xiangquan] with a worried expression, while [Zhu Xiangquan] saw Qiaoxiu in a trance.
0:28:51|0:28:58|Slowly opening his eyes, [Zhu Xiangquan] finally saw that the person standing in front of him was not Qiaoxiu, but [Meimei] whom he had never seen before.
0:29:7|0:29:10|[Meimei] glanced at [Cai Yafen].
0:29:12|0:29:13|[Cai Yafen] asked.
0:29:47|0:29:55|Up until now, I have only loved one person, [Meimei] said with tears in her eyes.
0:29:56|0:30:4|After speaking, he glanced at [Cai Yafen] sitting next to him, then looked at [Zhu Xiangquan] lying on the bed, sighed, and left sadly.
0:30:4|0:30:7|[Zhu Xiangquan] was confused and asked [Cai Yafen] in a puzzled tone.
0:30:8|0:30:12|Hearing this, [Cai Yafen] sneered and remained silent.
0:30:12|0:30:15|On the other side, the real [Zhao Yingquan] has already returned home.
0:30:27|0:30:31|[Zhang Ying] just lowered her head and remained silent after listening, while her father walked in at this moment.
0:31:26|0:31:26|Upon hearing this, the couple's faces both changed color, and they exchanged a glance.
0:31:59|0:32:5|The mother of [Zhao Yingquan], who heard the question, glanced at her husband, then lowered her head, seeming hesitant, as if wanting to speak but stopping herself.
0:32:5|0:32:9|[Zhao Yingquan] looked at the two of them in confusion.
0:32:27|0:32:53|It all started thirty years ago. Your dad and I had two classmates, a girl named [Zhu Qiushui] and a boy named [Zhang Shaobai]. The scene shifts to thirty years ago, where a young girl found a baby at her doorstep. They always carried two identical school bags.
0:32:55|0:33:23|Later, Zhu Qiushui combined the last character of their names and embroidered two identical "quan" characters on their schoolbags. However, Zhu Qiushui's family looked down on Zhang Shaobai's family for being too poor, and refused to agree to their lifelong commitment, secretly giving birth to a pair of twins.
0:33:26|0:33:38|The medical conditions were too poor, and shortly after giving birth, [Zhu Qiushui] passed away due to illness.
0:33:46|0:33:54|At this point, the father walked in from outside with a serious expression, handing a school bag embroidered with the character "全" to [Zhao Yingquan] without saying a word.
0:33:54|0:34:4|[Zhao Yingquan] immediately stood up, took the backpack with trembling hands, held it carefully in his hands and examined it as if he had lost strength, then slumped back into the chair.
0:34:17|0:34:26|Hearing this, [Zhao Yingquan] burst into tears and knelt down in front of his father with a splash.
0:34:47|0:34:49|The scene shifts to a hospital.
0:35:13|0:35:16|Upon hearing this, [Meimei] lowered her head in contemplation.
0:35:16|0:35:19|Downstairs of the Holiday Hotel, a car parked at the entrance, [Cai Yafen] took [Zhu Xiangquan] upstairs.
0:35:20|0:35:21|[Zhuxiang Quan], dressed in a new outfit, looked around the room and smiled as he glanced at the decorations.
0:35:55|0:35:58|[Zhu Xiangquan] curiously feels the soft sofa.
0:36:20|0:36:27|In the Beijiang Group, [Zhang Yingquan] returned to the office and as soon as he opened the door, he saw a letter lying on the ground. He bent down to pick up the letter.
0:36:28|0:36:31|After closing the door, walk while opening the envelope.
0:36:31|0:36:35|Upon opening it, the contents inside made her face change color.
0:36:35|0:36:40|The photo inside was the one of [Meimei] and the male tour guide when they visited the temple that day.
0:36:40|0:36:43|Due to the angle, [Meimei] and the man appeared particularly intimate.
0:36:43|0:36:49|She quickly flipped through the photos in the envelope, growing angrier with each one, and finally slammed the photos down on the table.
0:36:51|0:37:1|Sitting down on the sofa, he/she was so angry that he/she was panting heavily, silent for a moment, like a wet blade, closing his/her eyes and collapsing on the sofa.
0:37:1|0:37:10|On the other side, [Meimei], who mistook Zhu Xiangquan for Zhao Yingquan, recalled the words she said in the hospital during the day, realizing that her lover actually loved someone else.
0:37:10|0:37:16|She picked up the apple in front of her with a look of melancholy, biting into it with a vacant gaze, as if contemplating something.
0:37:16|0:37:19|Suddenly, she picked up the phone on the table and dialed Zhao Yingquan's number.
0:37:25|0:37:32|Zhao Yinquan, who is still working on this side, is in a bad mood. When he sees a call from [Meimei], he doesn't pay attention and puts it aside.
0:37:32|0:37:40|He looked at the ringing phone in silence for a moment, sighed deeply, still didn't answer it, pretended not to see it, and continued working.
0:37:40|0:37:43|[Meimei] saw that no one answered the phone, sighed, and sadly lowered her head.
0:37:46|0:37:55|Night falls, as Zhao Yingquan drives home after work, he hears the ringing of his phone again. He looks down and sees it's [Meimei], but he still ignores her because of the photo incident.
0:37:55|0:38:3|[Meimei], who couldn't get through the phone call, angrily threw down her phone, took a big bite of an apple, venting her grievances.
0:38:6|0:38:14|Faced with a series of blows, the anguished [Zhao Yinquan] came to the restaurant alone, seeking solace in alcohol.
0:38:14|0:38:17|The one who caused this misunderstanding was the instigator [Cai Yafen].
0:38:17|0:38:26|She has admired [Zhao Yinquan] for a long time. [Zhao Yinquan] met his cousin [Meimei] through her, and the two hit it off immediately, with their feelings quickly heating up.
0:38:26|0:38:30|So she felt jealous and had someone take a photo to send to [Zhao Yinquan] to frame [Meimei].
0:38:35|0:38:49|At this moment, [Cai Yafen]'s goal has been achieved. Due to a misunderstanding, [Zhao Yingquan] and [Meimei] have created a rift between them. Accompanied by the pouring rain outside, [Zhao Yingquan] reminisces about the beautiful times they once had together.
0:38:49|0:39:1|Thinking back to the photo he saw during the day, [Zhao Yingquan] felt like his heart was being twisted by a knife. His intimate lover betrayed him, and his parents who he spent day and night with turned out to have no blood relation with him. He was abandoned by others and picked up by his foster parents.
0:39:2|0:39:9|The love and family bonds have dealt a heavy blow to [Zhao Yingquan], making him increasingly sad as he thinks about it.
0:39:9|0:39:24|[Zhao Yingquan], who is heavily drunk, braves the pouring rain and staggers out of the restaurant. He reaches the car but can't open the door. He then stumbles onto the street, rain beating down on him, but he pays no attention. He drunkenly embraces passing vehicles.
0:39:35|0:39:43|Unable to catch a cab, [Zhao Yingquan] dashed aimlessly across the street, suddenly overwhelmed by a strong urge to vomit, prompting him to walk towards the roadside.
0:39:43|0:39:51|The effects of alcohol combined with the pouring rain caused him to lose his way, and he accidentally slipped and tumbled down the hill.
0:40:1|0:40:4|The father and son couldn't reach [赵颖泉] and, with no other options, they stood in the son's room looking at each other helplessly, sighed, and left empty-handed.
0:40:21|0:40:28|Early the next morning, a homeless man in a torn short-sleeved shirt was standing in front of a trash can, picking out items that could be sold.
0:40:28|0:40:33|Left picks up a bottle, right picks up a can, picking them up with great joy.
0:40:33|0:40:48|He looked around, searching for other useful things. In the distance, he saw something in the mud pit, but he didn't pay much attention to it. Just as he was about to turn and leave, he turned back and took a closer look. There, lying in the mud pit, was the person who had fallen last night, [Zhao Yingquan].
0:40:49|0:40:56|The homeless man was startled, dropped the bag full of plastic bottles in his hand, and hurriedly ran towards [Zhao Yingquan].
0:40:56|0:41:0|He squatted on the ground, patted [Zhao Yingquan]'s shoulder, and said.
0:41:17|0:41:24|The homeless man couldn't be woken up by [赵颖泉], and no one knew what had happened, so they had to drag him out of the pit first.
0:41:24|0:41:34|The unconscious [Zhao Yingquan] was too heavy to carry, the homeless man stumbled a few times before finally managing to carry him on his back, step by step up the hill.
0:42:13|0:42:20|Upon reaching this point, [Director Wang] casually walked up to the two of them and inquired with a probing tone as if by chance.
0:43:13|0:43:17|In the company, [Cai Yafen] learned about this matter and confidently said.
0:43:19|0:43:21|Director Wang walked up from behind her and spoke.
0:43:31|0:43:34|In the KTV, a beauty poured a glass of wine for Zhu Xiangquan sitting next to her.
0:43:57|0:44:4|The next morning, Zhu Xiangquan, who had drunk himself unconscious, woke up from his slumber, as if still carrying the fishy taste of his dreams.
0:44:4|0:44:10|The sunlight shining on his face stung his eyes, causing them to be a little blurry when he first opened them.
0:44:10|0:44:22|After struggling for a while, he finally woke up, but when he looked down, he was shocked to find that he was not wearing any clothes. And when he looked to the side, he saw a girl lying there.
0:45:27|0:45:29|[Cai Yafen] looked at him with a mysterious gaze.
0:46:3|0:46:10|In Yanling Village, an old man is herding ducks by the river, but suddenly the ducks become listless and staggeringly collapse to the ground.
0:46:10|0:46:14|The old man took another look forward, and there was even a duck lying on the ground.
0:46:14|0:46:18|The old man looked at the two suddenly dead ducks and shouted anxiously.
0:46:57|0:47:2|On the other side, Zhu Xiangquan followed [Cai Yafen]'s arrangement and walked out in a suit similar to Zhao Yunquan's.
0:47:3|0:47:4|Zhu Xiangquan looked at the two of them in confusion and asked.
0:47:4|0:47:5|He furrowed his brow and twisted his arms.
0:47:33|0:47:51|In the library, [Meimei] sat by the window, looking out with moist eyes, appearing burdened with worries. Suddenly, as if losing strength, she slowly lowered the hand supporting her face, weakly resting it on the table without saying a word, just lost in thought. After a while, she closed her eyes as if resigning to fate.
0:47:56|0:48:4|At dusk, the amnesiac [Zhao Ying] carried a large bag on his back, picking up trash on the roadside, followed by the homeless man who saved him.
0:48:4|0:48:12|At this moment, [Meimei], who was still staring blankly in the library, finally couldn't hold back anymore, falling into an emotional abyss, tears falling down like beads off a broken string.
0:48:19|0:48:33|[Zhao Yinquan] and [Ma Dongmei] walked to the restaurant where the incident happened. Looking at the familiar scene in front of them, [Zhao Yinquan] felt a sharp pain in his head. He walked while holding his head with his hand, unable to stop calling out in pain. The homeless man supported him and looked at him with concern, saying.
0:49:6|0:49:13|The homeless man comfortingly patted [Zhao Yingquan]'s head, then stood up, looked around, and left.
0:49:13|0:49:20|[Zhao Yingquan] squatted alone by the roadside, obediently waiting for the homeless man to come back with water.
0:49:20|0:49:26|On the other side, [Zhu Xiangquan] was holding a pen, imitating [Zhao Yingquan]'s handwriting, practicing his signature in the notebook.
0:49:26|0:49:31|Sitting beside, [Cai Yafen] picked up the notebook and cleared her throat, then smiled satisfactorily and said.
0:49:44|0:49:49|The scene shifts, [Zhu Xiangquan] dressed in a suit and pretending to be [Zhao Yingquan], arrives at the company.
0:49:49|0:49:52|The employees stood on both sides clapping and welcoming.
0:49:52|0:49:56|[Zhu Xiangquan] nodded and smiled in a dignified manner.
0:50:2|0:50:12|In the village of Yanling on the other side, an old man hurriedly walked out with ointment and handed it to the village chief sitting at the door.
0:50:31|0:50:33|The old man frowned when he heard this.
0:50:33|0:50:36|Turning their heads, the two arrived at the county hospital.
0:51:4|0:51:10|They walked into the hospital with a bottle of river water and handed the medicine to the doctor.
0:51:10|0:51:13|The two sat on chairs in the corridor waiting for the outcome.
0:51:13|0:51:16|The old man tilted his head and curiously looked around at everything.
0:51:16|0:51:23|[Doctor] in the hospital, responsible for testing samples, quickly reached a conclusion after a series of meticulous tests.
0:51:23|0:51:26|A doctor holding a report looks at the two people in the corridor and says.
0:51:36|0:51:39|The two who got the results returned to the village dejectedly.
0:51:39|0:51:46|According to the test results, it was found that there were nearly ten kinds of trace elements such as lead and chromium exceeding the standard in this water.
0:51:54|0:52:11|Understanding that everything is related to the river, the two of them came to the riverbank. The old man squatted by the river, looking at the withered plants. He reached out and pulled a piece down, held it in his hand and carefully examined it, then brought it to his nose to smell. In the blink of an eye, he saw the dead fish in the river.
0:53:24|0:53:30|The village chief alliance took out a report from the bag, and [Director Wang] frowned as he looked at the report in his hand.
0:54:24|0:54:29|A luxury car drove by, and [Zhu Xiangquan] and [Cai Yafen] got out of the car.
0:54:29|0:54:34|Through the car window, the two saw [Zhao Yunquan]'s parents standing under a tree, reaching for something.
0:54:38|0:54:40|Soon after, the two of them got out of the car.
0:54:56|0:55:3|After speaking, [Zhu Xiangquan] handed the briefcase in his hand to [Cai Yafen] standing beside him.
0:55:3|0:55:12|Jumping up and down with a stick a few times, failing to reach, then took off the ring from his hand, unbuttoned his shirt, took off his suit jacket, and handed it to [Cai Yafen].
0:55:31|0:55:51|[Zhu Xiangquan] was like an agile monkey, quickly climbing up the tree and reaching out to grab the garbage bag hanging on a branch. With a joyful smile, he bunched up the plastic bag and threw it to his father standing below the tree before climbing back down in no time.
0:55:51|0:55:55|The three people under the tree looked at him nervously.
0:56:0|0:56:2|On the other side, the village chief, who was unable to solve the problem, called [Director Wang] and waited solemnly for the other end to pick up the phone.
0:57:14|0:57:19|Here, the old men from the village come to the construction site with shovels in a domineering manner.
0:57:19|0:57:24|The security guard at the door, [Er Gouzi], saw Zhao Wenliang and immediately closed the gate, stepping aside to say.
0:57:35|0:57:43|Speak up, [Er Gouzi] looked at the crowd in the distance, suddenly remembered something, took out a lock from his pocket, and quickly went forward to lock the door.
0:57:43|0:57:55|The next moment, the villagers arrived at the door shouting.
0:58:55|0:59:6|The enraged villagers picked up their sticks and shovels and began to smash the door. [Er Gouzi] huddled up in fear, and at that moment, the [village chief] walked out from the crowd.
0:59:39|0:59:44|[Director Wang] hung up the phone, picked up the test report in his hand, and found [Cai Yafen].
0:59:44|0:59:46|[Cai Yafen] looked at the report, her brow furrowed.
1:0:9|1:0:15|[Cai Yafen] finished speaking, then turned around and left, leaving [Director Wang] alone, puzzled.
1:0:50|1:0:56|[Zhuxiang Quan], who had a nightmare, was suddenly scared into a cold sweat, and impatiently unbuttoned his shirt.
1:0:56|1:1:1|Shaken, he picked up the glass on the table and drank a gulp of water to calm himself down.
1:1:1|1:1:3|Suddenly, the phone on the table rang.
1:1:14|1:1:24|Unable to get through on the phone, [Cai Yafen] furrowed her brow. At this moment, the house was empty, with only a suit left on the sofa and a phone constantly ringing on the beads.
1:1:24|1:1:30|And at this moment, [Zhu Xiangquan] had already sneaked out sneakily, while the frustrated [Director Wang] who couldn't find anyone, angrily scolded the guards.
1:1:45|1:1:48|[Qiayafen] took out a stack of banknotes from her bag and handed it to the two people.
1:2:16|1:2:22|The very venomous [Cai Yafen] combined with the cunning [Director Wang], the two of them are full of bad intentions, who knows what evil plan they have come up with again.
1:2:23|1:2:27|In the dead of night, the amnesiac [Zhao Yingquan] appeared alone by the river.
1:2:27|1:2:31|The footsteps were heavy, walking forward in a daze.
1:2:31|1:2:33|His eyes were lifeless, and it was unclear what he was thinking.
1:2:33|1:2:40|Suddenly, a thug appeared behind him and covered [Zhao Yingquan]'s mouth with a piece of cloth.
1:2:40|1:2:43|He struggled for a moment and then passed out.
1:2:43|1:2:46|Two more thugs appeared and together they carried the unconscious [Zhao Yingquan] away.
1:2:47|1:2:51|The scene shifts to a construction site, with a car slowly approaching with its headlights on.
1:2:51|1:2:55|In the house, [Zhang Yingquan] is tied up to a chair.
1:2:55|1:3:4|The door is opened, and the person leading the way is wearing a pair of exquisite high heels.
1:3:4|1:3:7|The camera slowly rises, and the person who comes is [Cai Yafen].
1:3:7|1:3:10|She approached [Zhang Yingquan] with a fierce look on her face.
1:3:10|1:3:12|[Zhang Yingquan] looked up at her.
1:3:45|1:3:47|Driven by love turned into hatred, [Cai Yafen] gasped heavily, glaring fiercely at [Zhang Yingquan].
1:3:47|1:3:48|Zhang Yiquan looked at [Cai Yafen], who couldn't remember anything and had a blank expression on her face. She then slowly lowered her head and fell into contemplation.
1:4:16|1:4:20|The next morning, the long-lost [Zhu Xiangquan] returned home.
1:4:41|1:4:49|The woman who hadn't seen her son for a long time excitedly took [Zhu Xiangquan]'s hand and helped him onto a chair.
1:4:49|1:4:55|On the other side, poor [Zhao Yingquan] was tied to a chair and fell asleep sitting like that for the whole night.
1:4:55|1:4:58|The sunlight shone on his face, stinging his eyes.
1:4:58|1:5:1|[Zhao Yingquan], who had been tied up all night, painfully opened his eyes.
1:5:1|1:5:4|Suddenly, some images appeared in his mind.
1:5:31|1:5:38|After recalling his identity, [Zhao Yingquan] couldn't bear the shock, his head ached unbearably, and the next second he passed out.
1:5:40|1:5:44|At night, a worker came to open the door, holding a bowl of rice and walked in.
1:5:44|1:5:53|He closed the door, looked at the sleeping [Zhao Yunquan], walked over, put the meal aside, patted him, and spoke.
1:6:41|1:6:44|The supervisor here is named [Zhou Lianfu].
1:6:57|1:7:12|[Zhao Yingquan] watched the departing worker with a million emotions in his heart, until the worker left, [Zhao Yingquan] finally looked away. He looked around the room helplessly, sighed deeply, and could only hope for the worker who had just left.
1:7:12|1:7:21|Absently, [Zhao Yingquan] lowered his head and fell into contemplation. The construction site at night was still operating smoothly, with no one noticing the small dark room in the factory area.
1:7:21|1:7:25|Before long, the door of the dark room opened, and [Zhou Lianfu] walked in.
1:8:3|1:8:10|Taking advantage of the night, the two of them used the pillars in the area as cover, hiding from the crowd.
1:8:10|1:8:24|Following the route of [Zhou Lianfu] escaping, the two arrived at a large truck. [Zhang Yingquan] stepped on [Zhou Lianfu]'s shoulders, pushed hard, and climbed onto the roof of the truck to hide. As the sky began to light up slightly, the truck drove to the entrance of the construction site.
1:8:24|1:8:32|The old man who opened the door at the entrance stood up when he saw the familiar vehicle. The negligent security guard did not conduct thorough checks and simply opened the gate to the construction site.
1:8:33|1:8:39|With the start of the truck, hidden on the roof, [Zhao Yingquan] finally managed to escape from the den of demons.
1:8:39|1:8:44|After driving away with the vehicle, the old man tightly closed the gate of the construction site.
1:8:44|1:8:46|The vehicle is driving on a deserted street.
1:8:46|1:8:50|The truck, which should have been running smoothly, suddenly came to a stop.
1:8:50|1:8:56|The driver in the car parked the car, opened the door, got out of the car, and hurriedly looked for a place to relieve himself while holding his stomach.
1:8:57|1:9:7|Upon hearing the sound of the door closing, [Zhang Yingquan] slowly poked his head out from the roof of the car, took a look around, and this time, the cautious [Zhang Yingquan] who had narrowly escaped disaster appeared particularly careful.
1:9:7|1:9:18|After making sure the driver had gone far away, she seized the opportunity to take the next step. Slowly, she turned her body to the side and carefully climbed down from the roof of the car, afraid of being discovered, not daring to make any sudden movements.
1:9:19|1:9:31|After getting off, he didn't recklessly leave immediately, but cautiously hid behind the car to observe the surroundings, making sure there were no suspicious individuals around the factory before quickly running away.
1:9:31|1:9:39|Exhausted from a successful escape, [Zhao Yinquan] staggered to a bathhouse with heavy steps.
1:9:39|1:9:42|He looked up and then walked in.
1:9:42|1:9:45|The waiter at the door immediately greeted them.
1:9:45|1:9:52|After [Zhuangyingquan] emerged from the bathhouse, he looked radiant and all signs of his previous disheveled appearance were gone.
1:9:52|1:9:56|He changed into a clean and sharp suit and walked out confidently.
1:9:57|1:10:2|On the other side, inside the hotel, [Director Wang] is still mingling privately with [Cai Yafen].
1:10:2|1:10:5|Suddenly, a ringing phone interrupted them.
1:10:5|1:10:10|[Director Wang] crawled out of bed, leaned on the edge of the bed, and frantically searched for his phone in the scattered clothes pockets.
1:10:44|1:10:47|[Zhao Yunquan] ran away.
1:10:54|1:10:57|[Zhao Yunquan] has lost his memory.
1:11:11|1:11:18|Early the next morning, [Cai Yafen] and [Director Wang] hurriedly rushed to the office, frantically destroying various documents.
1:11:18|1:11:26|[Cai Yafen] sat in front of the computer, expressionless, deleting the Yanling project files, while [Director Wang] checked various reports on the side.
1:11:26|1:11:34|At this moment, [Zhao Yingquan] had a determined look on his face as he walked with firm steps to a telephone booth, then inserted a phone card and dialed a series of numbers.
1:11:34|1:11:38|On the other side, [Cai Yafen], who was still destroying documents, answered the phone.
1:11:40|1:11:46|Zhang Yingquan remained silent.
1:11:56|1:12:3|Upon hearing the words of [Zhao Yinquan], [Cai Yafen] was shocked, her eyes widened, and she trembled as she asked with quivering lips.
1:12:3|1:12:11|[Zhao Yinquan] hung up the phone directly, knowing that the truth was exposed, [Cai Yafen] turned pale and stood up tremblingly.
1:12:20|1:12:26|On the other side, [Zhu Xiangquan], who returned to the village, came to Qiaoxiu's house, handed the photo to Qiaoxiu, and confessed his mistake.
1:12:26|1:12:29|After looking at the photo, Qiaoxiu stared at her in disbelief.
1:13:23|1:13:29|After a big argument, Qiaoxiu, unwilling to accept defeat, angrily stomped on the bricks just laid by [Zhu Xiangquan], and threw away his tools.
1:13:29|1:13:37|[Zhu Xiangquan] said nothing and silently picked up the tools.
1:13:37|1:13:45|Qiao Xiu finished speaking, her eyes moistened, but [Zhu Xiangquan] still remained silent.
1:13:53|1:14:2|Xiaoxiu said she wouldn't be soft-hearted, but tears had already filled her face. She gently sobbed and squatted down, looking at the face of [Zhu Xiangquan], saying nothing.
1:14:2|1:14:3|Just silently shedding tears.
1:14:4|1:14:7|He just looked at her like that, reminiscing about the good times they had.
1:14:7|1:14:12|He couldn't understand how [Zhu Xiangquan] had changed so much after being away for just a few days.
1:14:12|1:14:14|He bit his lip, as if wanting to say something.
1:14:14|1:14:18|[Ma Dongmei] lowered her head in silence for a long time, but ultimately couldn't speak.
1:14:18|1:14:24|Finally, filled with frustration and nowhere to vent, he grabbed a handful of mud from the ground and smashed it onto [Zhu Xiangquan]'s head.
1:14:24|1:14:27|Ke [Zhu Xiangquan] still didn't react.
1:14:27|1:14:31|Just like that, handfuls of mud rained down on him like drops of rain.
1:14:38|1:14:52|On this side, [Zhu Xiangquan] and [Zhao Yingquan] have not reconciled yet. On the other side, the neatly dressed [Zhao Yingquan] walked to the library, hesitated at the door for a moment, but ultimately chose to walk in.
1:14:52|1:15:0|Walking through the corridor, she arrived at the spot where [Meimei] often sat. As expected, she was still there. [Zhaoyingquan] walked up to [Meimei] and placed a photo on her book.
1:15:10|1:15:24|[Meimei] opened the envelope and saw a photo of herself and the tour guide inside. The content of the photo left her in disbelief, and she looked up in astonishment.
1:15:24|1:15:28|In order not to disturb other people in the library, the two of them went to the rooftop.
1:15:28|1:15:33|[Zhao Yingquan] stood silently with his hands behind his back at the edge of the rooftop, waiting for [Meimei] to explain.
1:15:33|1:15:37|[Meimei] walked over from behind with a photo in her hand, standing next to [Zhao Yingquan] and looking at him.
1:15:40|1:15:50|He put his arm around [Meimei]'s shoulder, led her to sit on the chair, and then spoke earnestly to [Meimei].
1:17:34|1:17:38|[Zhang Yiquan] and [Meimei] finally cleared up their misunderstanding and reconciled.
1:17:38|1:17:45|On the other side, [Qiao Xiu] watched [Zhu Xiangquan] sweeping the floor, unable to suppress her emotions, she rushed towards him and hugged him.
1:17:54|1:18:0|[Xiao Xiu] tightly hugged [Zhu Xiangquan] and chose to forgive him, while [Meimei] and [Zhang Yingquan] also went back home together.
1:18:41|1:18:41|The parents exchanged a glance upon hearing this, and then said nothing more.
1:19:7|1:19:12|In the blink of an eye, [Zhao Yingquan] drove to Yanling Village with his parents and [Meimei].
1:19:12|1:19:17|The car stopped by the roadside, and a family of four got out of the car with smiles on their faces, looking excited.
1:19:17|1:19:24|After getting off the car, [Zhao Yingquan's mother] took a few steps forward, looked around, and sighed at the green mountains and trees beside her.
1:19:42|1:19:49|But no one would have expected that there was also a great crisis.
1:20:19|1:20:33|Hearing the familiar name of Yanling Village, [Zhao Yingquan's mother] was visibly stunned. Thinking about Zhao Yingquan's background, she glanced at her husband, hesitated for a moment, and then followed along with a hesitant expression. The group walked slowly towards Yanling Village.
1:20:33|1:20:48|Upon entering the village, the first thing that catches the eye is a towering old tree in the center of the village. Despite being an ancient tree, new branches are sprouting from its canopy, showing vigorous vitality. It resembles an old person who has experienced many hardships, yet still guards the entire village through wind and rain.
1:20:49|1:20:55|Several people looked up at the ancient tree, which, against the backdrop of the ancient tree, had turned into an elephant the size of an ant.
1:20:55|1:21:3|Window Gushu arrived at the [Zhu Xiangquan's home], where several people sat around, and [Zhu Xiangquan's mother] spoke up.
1:21:29|1:21:35|[Mrs. Zhang Yingquan] held her hand after hearing it, trembling, tears falling down heavily.
1:22:55|1:23:1|[Mrs. Zhu Xiangquan] looked at them blankly, shook her head, and then let out a heavy sigh.
1:23:10|1:23:16|At this point, several adults were already in tears, lamenting the plight of [Zhang Shaobai].
1:23:24|1:23:35|Hearing this, [Zhao Yingquan] looked up at her, only to see the tear-streaked woman bowing her head in silence, then smiling as if in resignation.
1:23:35|1:23:39|The scene cuts to [Zhao Yingquan] kneeling in front of a tombstone, choking back tears as he shouts.
1:23:41|1:23:46|Trembling, [Character] knocked heavily on the grave three times.
1:23:46|1:23:51|Onlookers couldn't help but shed tears when they saw this scene.
1:23:51|1:23:57|[Zhao Yingquan] knelt on the ground, picked up a handful of soil, and gently placed it on his mother's grave.
1:23:57|1:24:2|After adding the soil, [Zhao Yingquan] knelt in front of the grave, quietly looking at his mother's tombstone.
1:24:2|1:24:8|She was too preoccupied to care about whether a man's tears could be held back, and she couldn't stop choking up.
1:24:8|1:24:10|Every time I see [Zhao Yingquan] like this, I can't help but feel heartbroken.
1:27:21|1:27:33|Good and evil will be rewarded, [Cai Yafen] and others have been punished by the law, and everything in the village has returned to normal, showing a thriving atmosphere.
