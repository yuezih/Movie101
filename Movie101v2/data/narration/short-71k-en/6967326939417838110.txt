0:2:50|0:2:58|The unruly steed continued to gallop forward, and the group turned towards another intersection.
0:2:58|0:3:9|Chasing on the sand dunes, [William] galloped excitedly, shouting without realizing he was chasing in the wrong direction.
0:3:10|0:3:14|The yellow sand scattered freely among the chasing herd of horses.
0:3:14|0:3:22|Under the shadow of the giant rock, [William] the leader watched as the pursuers departed, nodding towards the others.
0:3:22|0:3:30|The crowd dared not slack off, changed direction and continued to flee, the desert sun casting long shadows of the escapees.
0:3:33|0:3:41|At night, a person is bandaging a thigh wound by the campfire, with [William] and [Pero] looking on coldly, [William] with a face full of unwillingness.
0:5:30|0:5:38|A strange gust of wind blew in, causing the flames of the torches to flicker. Just as the two figures in front of the bonfire looked up, a blurry figure flashed by.
0:5:38|0:5:47|The two were attacked by an unknown object. [William] and [Pero] quickly gathered their spirits, drew their swords cautiously, and approached the fire pit quietly.
0:5:50|0:6:1|In front of them was only a lonely bonfire. Looking around, [Pero] noticed a trail of fresh blood on the ground.
0:6:2|0:6:10|A strange noise is heard, the two stand back to back holding their swords defensively. [Pero] nervously says:
0:6:20|0:6:29|[William] raised his long sword high and struck with all his might, cutting off a beast's claw. He slashed horizontally and vertically, and with two consecutive strikes, the monster fell off the cliff.
0:6:45|0:6:59|Crossing the desert, the land gradually became more vegetated. On a small path, [William] and [Pero] rode on horseback. In the distance behind them, the sound of galloping horses could be heard, and the two turned around to see the Khitan people approaching.
0:7:5|0:7:18|After speaking, William and Female General hurried towards the mountain, while several riders with bows and whips chased after them, already reaching the narrow mountain path.
0:7:18|0:7:22|The winding path was dusty, and the Khitan people were in high spirits.
0:7:22|0:7:28|Two men rode their horses up the mountain along a small path, with pursuers shouting and brandishing large knives closely behind them.
0:7:28|0:7:47|Climbing over the steep slope, the sound of horse hooves fading away, the two sides getting closer and closer, the Khitan people starting to get excited. [Pero] glanced back, then urged his horse to catch up with [William], the two of them riding up a hill, only to stand dumbfounded in place.
0:7:59|0:8:4|Upon the command of the generals, a rain of arrows fell to the ground, forming a circle trapping the two individuals.
0:8:4|0:8:11|Hundreds of soldiers clad in armor and wielding spears, the towering Great Wall came into view as two figures looked up.
0:8:12|0:8:19|On the city wall, there were hundreds of archers wearing soft armor, drawing their bows and waiting to release their arrows.
0:8:19|0:8:26|On the city wall road, the cavalry is orderly and marching in formation, while the towering beacon tower is emitting thick smoke.
0:8:26|0:8:35|The two turned their horses around and looked back at the Khitan people who were approaching.
0:8:49|0:8:55|[William] took the lead in dismounting, and the two of them raised their hands high and walked towards the city wall.
0:9:5|0:9:9|[William] gave him a glare, and the two of them dropped their weapons in unison.
0:9:18|0:9:24|Three generals, dressed in various specially made armors, wearing cloaks, and carrying waist knives, walked proudly and confidently.
0:9:36|0:9:44|In the center, [Female General] slowly raised her head, and a fierce and terrifying beast claw was thrown onto the table in the military camp.
0:9:44|0:9:51|Four generals stepped forward to inspect,
0:11:22|0:11:48|Upstairs, the foreigner secretly observed as the soldiers approached and opened the two men's clothes, revealing the armor underneath. [Female General] drew her sword and pointed it directly at [William]'s neck. On the stage, [Dian Shuai] frowned and advised, "[Female General], raise your sword," after a moment of hesitation, she snorted coldly and sheathed her sword.
0:11:50|0:11:58|He then continued to report forward.
0:12:33|0:12:39|The sentry pushed the door open and entered, quickly descending the stairs to report the military situation.
0:12:46|0:12:51|The sentry received the order and ran out quickly, while the tightly coordinated drumming on the city tower was intimidating.
0:12:52|0:12:58|Gazing at the steep mountains in the distance, the winding Great Wall sprawls across them, with beacon towers emitting smoke signals.
0:13:3|0:13:10|Inside the city, [Female General] and [Counselor Wang] are escorting two individuals.
0:13:56|0:14:2|The team arrived at the entrance of the warehouse, where the young soldier frantically searched for the keys.
0:14:10|0:14:17|On the beacon tower, the soldiers and generals were waiting in formation, with [Dian Shuai] looking solemn. At this moment, [Counselor Wang] strode over.
0:14:22|0:14:29|A well-trained infantry unit rushes towards the city wall at the gate.
0:14:29|0:14:38|The team escorting [William] arrived at the gate, and the huge gate slowly opened, with water rushing inside hitting the waterwheel.
0:14:48|0:14:54|The bare-bodied guards stirred the wheel together, the sound of machinery echoed, and the hemp rope slowly pulled the cage up.
0:14:54|0:15:0|As they passed each level of the attic, the soldiers inside were preparing for battle.
0:15:4|0:15:14|Some soldiers and warriors are holding torches, some are forging iron, the gears of the mechanism slowly turning. At the top, a bronze phoenix locked in a red cage.
0:15:17|0:15:36|The Vermilion Bird slowly rises to the surface of the Great Wall, where soldiers are lined up neatly. Not far away, a column of imperial guards escorts two people over, while the Vermilion Bird mechanism on the side slowly rises, unfolding four iron bridges for one person each.
0:15:38|0:16:3|The Imperial Guards with spears forced [William] and another person into a corner. They looked towards the Great Wall, where a catapult slowly emerged from the wall. Beside it, a young soldier shouted, "On the main road of the wall, the female generals and infantry are marching in two separate formations, in an orderly manner."
0:16:3|0:16:12|[Female General] handed the iron helmet to the general. [Female General] put on the iron helmet and looked into the distance, standing by the stone drum.
0:16:46|0:16:56|On the high platform on the city wall, soldiers raised their crossbows high, ready for battle. Female soldiers on the Vermilion Bird Ironworks tightened their belts one after another.
0:16:56|0:17:4|William strode towards the forefront of the Iron Wing. [Pero] saw this scene and asked:
0:17:7|0:17:20|The female soldier walked to the forefront of the Iron Wing, and soldiers on the Vermilion Bird Platform threw spears. The female soldier caught the spear thrown by her ally, collectively turned the gun heads, bent down and stood, pointing straight down to the city. [William] sighed.
0:17:28|0:17:48|Leading the way, [Female General] strides on the iron wings of the Vermilion Bird. Next, two spears fly towards her, which she catches in mid-air with both hands, arms outstretched in a fighting stance. On the city wall, the soldiers look serious, with [Dian Shuai] sitting in the center, exuding a dignified air as he gazes intently into the distance.
0:17:49|0:18:1|On the city wall, the archers with giant crossbows are ready, while Zhuque Jun stands proudly with an iron wing spear in hand.
0:18:3|0:18:12|The city wall is overgrown with wild rocks, resembling a desert. In the reed valley, huge stones stand tall with no grass in sight. The sound of the wind faintly carries on.
0:18:14|0:18:31|[Pero] couldn't help but ask. At this moment, thousands of exotic beasts were rushing towards the Great Wall. The general remained calm and issued orders, while the drummers on the city wall beat the drums to relay commands, the sound of drums echoing from the towering walls.
0:18:32|0:18:53|Inside the Great Wall, the strongmen are moving giant stones. They pour hot oil on the stones, and when the soldiers' torches approach the stones coated with sesame oil, they instantly turn into fireballs. With a push of a wooden stick, the fireballs roll down rapidly, while outside the Great Wall, one after another stone-throwing arm swings them out.
0:18:53|0:18:59|Fireballs streaked across the sky like meteors, trailing long plumes of smoke as they crashed down on the ravenous alien beast.
0:19:0|0:19:11|The fireball landed and immediately exploded, smashing the limbs of the alien beast. The archers on the city wall acted in unison, and for a moment, a volley of arrows rained down.
0:19:11|0:19:17|Arrows of iron were shot at the alien beast, and one arrow hit the eye of the Taotie, causing it to fall to the ground.
0:19:22|0:19:29|A ferocious beast climbed up the rock and roared angrily, then leaped forward to join the army in leading the charge.
0:19:29|0:19:39|Above the entire wilderness, strange beasts roamed everywhere dragging balls of thick smoke, while a rain of crossbow bolts filled the sky, with each ball of fire drawing an arc in the sky.
0:19:39|0:19:42|The gluttonous army charged fearlessly from the canyon.
0:19:44|0:19:50|The main general dared not delay, and immediately ordered Female General to lead the troops with a flying rope in hand and a long spear.
0:19:53|0:20:1|The female general fiercely thrust two spears into the Taotie's body, soldiers on the city tower stirred the ropes, allowing the female general to be pulled back.
0:20:1|0:20:10|[William] The two of them watched in shock as the female soldiers on the ironworks threw down two more spears, which flew into the mouth of the gluttonous creature, preventing it from climbing the Great Wall.
0:20:10|0:20:18|The [Female General] on the iron platform spread her arms, holding a spear and striking down with remarkable grace, wielding her twin spears to stab at the glutton.
0:20:18|0:20:33|Dragged back again, a female soldier was leaped upon by the Taotie in mid-air, her abdomen dragged down to the city walls. The Taotie quickly tore her apart, limbs scattering in an instant.
0:20:33|0:20:42|In the secret chamber on the city wall, the soldiers stirred the wheel and only pulled back the waist chains. They took off the waist chains stained red with blood and stored them together.
0:20:42|0:20:50|[William] and [Pero] were deeply impressed by such an army, while the foreign old man hid in the corner.
0:20:54|0:21:2|The battlefield was filled with smoke and fire, as the endless and voracious army rushed through the chaotic rocky valley.
0:21:2|0:21:16|In their army, there is a group of strong bronze-winged gluttonous beasts, they all fold their bronze wings, in the middle is the terrifying leader of the gluttonous beasts with fangs, the leader howls to the sky.
0:21:21|0:21:37|Under the command of [Dian Shuai], soldiers ignited the giant flaming meteor hammer and simultaneously launched hundreds of flying fire meteor hammers towards the Beast King. All the gluttonous beasts spread their wings to form a protective barrier, observed [Dian Shuai].
0:21:37|0:21:50|The protected Beast King not only emerged unscathed, but also let out a furious roar, shaking the horns on its head and signaling to all the gluttons with its head. The glutton army charged even more bravely towards the Great Wall.
0:21:50|0:22:1|The layers of Taotie surged like waves under the city walls, launching an attack towards the Great Wall that resembled a dam.
0:22:2|0:22:10|On the high platform, shouts pierced through the sky filled with flames of war, and the soldiers quickly responded by forming their battle formation, raising their spears.
0:22:10|0:22:23|The horde of Taotie is almost insane, unafraid of arrows, already climbing the wall. The first Taotie, using all four limbs, climbs up the city wall, fiercely opening its bloodthirsty mouth to bite and devour the soldiers.
0:22:23|0:22:46|The V-shaped formation was broken by his strike, and the Taotie on the city wall casually picked up a soldier, threw him off the wall, and the soldiers in the air were torn apart by the Taotie outside the wall. Everyone deployed in formation and charged towards the Taotie, the young soldier guarding [William] looked anxious, worriedly watching his comrades. [William] saw the foreign old man approaching and shouted loudly.
0:22:50|0:22:58|The young soldier hesitated, but the Taotie on the city wall shook its head and tail, knocking him away. The soldier made up his mind, dropped his shield, and charged into battle.
0:23:4|0:23:10|The young soldier exerted all his strength to stab the long spear into the hind leg of the gluttonous beast, only to be sent flying by the beast with a sudden turn.
0:23:12|0:23:25|The Taotie was closing in on the young soldier step by step, it pulled out the spear with its sharp teeth and flung it, [William] jumped high against the wall to catch the spear in mid-air, and thrust it into the Taotie's huge mouth.
0:23:25|0:23:32|[Pero] held a pointed shield above his head and charged straight at the young soldier.
0:23:33|0:23:43|[William] pulled the little soldier to safety, dodged the attack of the monster, crashed into the crowd, changed direction, and came out again. [William] kicked the little soldier away, the monster missed again, and crashed heavily into the city wall.
0:23:43|0:23:56|The Taotie opens its huge mouth and crawls towards [William]. [William] thrusts a spear into the giant mouth, with the other end against the ground. The enraged Taotie pushes [William] along the ground, and in desperation, kicks a long spear.
0:23:56|0:24:4|[William] took the spear and thrust it into the Taotie, causing it to retreat in pain. Kro continued to pursue, using his shield to push the iron spear even deeper.
0:24:4|0:24:19|[William] picked up a crossbow from the ground and turned it into a sturdy bow. More monsters climbed up the city wall from outside, charging towards the crowd on the wall. [Pero] rushed over, grabbed a red cloth, and vigorously waved it.
0:24:20|0:24:23|The Taotie is attracted by the moving red cloth.
0:24:24|0:24:30|It turned around and sprinted towards the red cloth, behind which was [William] with a bow and arrow ready.
0:24:30|0:24:37|The Taotie was shot in the eye and fell to the ground. The old man shouted for help as another Taotie ran towards him.
0:24:39|0:24:43|[Pero] saw the old man narrowly dodge the fatal pounce of the Taotie.
0:24:43|0:24:49|[William] A skater slid through the belly of the Taotie, shooting an arrow into its eye in one smooth motion.
0:24:49|0:24:52|The Taotie falls to the ground, blood splattering out.
0:24:53|0:25:2|Outside the city walls, cannons roared, giant stones and meteor hammers whistled past, the leader of the Taotie tribe observed the battle, lowering its head to signal with its horns.
0:25:2|0:25:11|The gluttonous army stopped their movements one after another, and the brown-haired one behind them received the retreat signal, using its mouth to drag the injured companion. The army retreated like a tide.
0:25:11|0:25:21|The city walls are filled with the swords of the fallen, as [William] uses his last strength to pick up his dead comrade and throw him off the wall, slowly dragging him away among the rubble. Overlooking the battlefield riddled with wounds,
0:25:21|0:25:30|The scattered Taotie are being dragged or falling away from their companions.
0:25:32|0:25:38|[Dian Shuai] and [Counselor Wang] also led troops to the outskirts of the city to observe, while the archers collected their weapons and advanced slowly.
0:25:38|0:25:47|The female general on the Vermilion Bird's wings also gazed into the distance, while soldiers on the city wall pushed carts to clean up the battlefield and tidy up the troops.
0:25:47|0:25:59|[Pero] wearily asked [William], "Who are leading the approaching Imperial Guards?" It was [Dian Shuai] and [Female General], with [Counselor Wang] following closely behind.
0:25:59|0:26:4|[Dian Shuai] slowly brought the Forbidden Army to a halt, gazing steadfastly at the two with [Female General].
0:26:5|0:26:13|[William] first dropped the hard bow in his hand, and the dejected [Pero] dropped his swords, [William] gently pushed [Pero].
0:26:13|0:26:19|[Pero] watched as the Forbidden Army dropped the dagger hidden in his waist, and all the soldiers stared at the two of them.
0:26:34|0:26:48|In the stone chamber, [William] wearily walked down the stairs, the torches on the wall illuminating the room. [William] looked around, frowning suddenly as his gaze was drawn to something. It was his own reflection in a mottled bronze mirror.
0:26:49|0:26:56|Looking at his unkempt reflection in the bronze mirror, [William] suddenly realized that he had been on the run for days.
0:26:56|0:27:3|The dirty-faced young soldier pushed the door open. [William] just came to his senses, and the soldier respectfully saluted.
0:27:4|0:27:15|[William] looked at the young soldier, nodded, wanting to say something, but then remembered the language barrier. He awkwardly raised his hand and clasped his fist, the young soldier smiled in relief.
0:27:15|0:27:19|Turning around and walking away, the sunlight shining down, [William] felt a mix of emotions in his heart.
0:27:21|0:27:28|The cold night falls on the city walls, where two figures stand, [Dian Shuai] and [Female General].
0:27:53|0:28:23|[Dian Shuai] finished speaking and instructed [Female General]. Inside the stone room, [William] suddenly opened his eyes, immediately drew the dagger from his boot, [Pero] pulled out a scimitar and jumped off the bed. It was only then that [William] recognized the foreign old man he had saved during the day.
0:28:36|0:28:42|[William] looked at [Pero] upon hearing the words.
0:28:50|0:29:4|The old man criticized [William] for his incomprehensible behavior. He glanced disapprovingly and then turned away unsteadily.
0:29:6|0:29:12|The door closes, [Pero] says excitedly:
0:29:33|0:29:46|[William] nodded in agreement: The sturdy iron gate slowly opened, and two handsome foreigners walked in. It was none other than the transformed [William] after their rest and makeover.
0:29:46|0:29:53|Following the soldiers' lead, the two entered the military banquet. [Dian Shuai] stood up and applauded, as the two slowly entered everyone's sight.
0:29:53|0:29:58|The soldiers and officers stood up and applauded, [William] and [Pero] looked a bit bewildered.
0:29:58|0:30:7|The two of them looked at each other, walked down the stairs together amidst enthusiastic applause, and strode towards the center of the banquet.
0:30:7|0:30:15|The applause subsided as the generals and soldiers took their seats.
0:30:18|0:30:32|[William] nervously pursed his lips and said, "[Pero] teased, as [General Chen], clad in custom armor, approached with [William]'s weapon."
0:30:42|0:30:49|General Chen returned the weapons to him and saluted.
0:30:55|0:31:1|The audience burst into laughter at these words.
0:31:2|0:31:9|In the hall, the soldiers and generals stood up and applauded, while the soldiers on both sides moved the tables to make room.
0:31:21|0:31:38|Everyone looked at [William], who spoke softly. [Pero] looked displeased as he quickly walked to the table, picked up a wine bowl, drank it all in one gulp, wiped his mouth with the empty bowl, and walked over. [William] handed the wine flask to [Pero] and said:
0:31:57|0:32:19|[William] attracted everyone's attention by tossing the empty bowl and flipping the iron bowl. [William] shot three arrows in a row, the first arrow hit accurately, causing the flying bowl to collide with a pillar. The falling bowl was stopped by the second arrow nailed into the pillar, still teetering on the edge. At a critical moment, the third arrow came with a breaking wind sound, and together with the second arrow, it caught the falling empty bowl.
0:32:19|0:32:28|The generals were shocked by this incredible archery skill, and then collectively stood up and burst into thunderous applause, even [Dian Shuai] cast a look of approval.
0:32:28|0:32:33|William's archery skills won the applause of the audience. William walked over and stuffed the quiver into William's arms.
0:34:15|0:34:27|[Female General] thought for a moment and said, [William] seemed a bit puzzled. Looking at the food, he stared at [Female General] waiting for her explanation. After a moment of contemplation, [Female General] spoke.
0:34:40|0:34:49|On the city wall, [William] walks while looking around. Soldiers on the Vermilion Bird Tower are preparing ropes. [Female General] carries a lasso and walks towards [William], gazing at him from a distance.
0:34:50|0:35:3|[Female General] waved her hand to invite, [William] walked in confidently and climbed up the Vermilion Tower along the ladder steadily. Looking at the scenery on the platform, [William] felt awe in his heart. [Female General] walked to the side with a safety rope, and the three Vermilion Birds all put on their waist locks one after another.
0:35:5|0:35:10|[William] snorted disdainfully and looked up, only to realize that he was already dozens of feet high.
0:35:17|0:35:24|[Female General] explained, and the smiles on the faces of several female soldiers brightened even more, prompting [Female General] to smile as well.
0:35:38|0:35:46|On the towering Vermilion Bird Terrace, thick hemp ropes hung five iron wings. [William] slowly made his way around the ropes.
0:35:46|0:35:57|[Female General] followed behind with a leash in hand, nearing the end of the Iron Wing, [William] slowed down, leaning down to look below, right at the previous battlefield. [William] turned around and started walking back.
0:36:48|0:36:55|[William] frowned in thought, never having experienced such emotions before. It seemed like he had made up his mind to move forward.
0:36:55|0:37:3|Deep down, he wasn't actually afraid to leap from here, looking at the battle scars left behind that day, he understood.
0:37:19|0:37:25|General Wu, clad in red armor, is leading a team to inspect the defense works inside the city.
0:37:28|0:37:36|On a table, a small bowl bursts into bright flames, causing [William] and [Balade] to instinctively dodge. [Balade] laughs and says:
0:40:13|0:40:25|A column of imperial guards came galloping, led by [Dian Shuai], followed closely by attendants holding torches and shouting announcements. The imperial guards slowed down as they approached the body of a night watchman lying not far ahead.
0:40:25|0:40:37|[Dian Shuai] raised his hand to signal, and the imperial guards stopped steadily. [Dian Shuai] looked puzzled and said, then he waved his hand to give the order, and the imperial guards quietly dismounted.
0:40:38|0:40:44|[Dian Shuai] and [Female General] drew their swords, opened the reins, advanced in an orderly manner, and quickly formed a formation.
0:40:44|0:40:49|Contradictions form the defensive formation, with [Dian Shuai] surveying the situation through the cracks.
0:40:49|0:41:4|The body of the sentry flowed with a large amount of blood, as [Dian Shuai] led the army forward slowly. The Great Wall stood proudly under the moonlight, and as they advanced a hundred feet ahead, a ferocious monster, the Taotie, crawled forward with its terrifying fangs exposed.
0:41:8|0:41:13|At the command, the troops formed up steadily and advanced in a neat and orderly manner.
0:41:13|0:41:21|[Dian Shuai], holding a precious sword in his hand, showed his anger without being intimidating. He inadvertently noticed the danger behind him through the moonlight reflected by the sword.
0:41:21|0:41:30|Another Taotie quietly followed, waiting for an opportunity to strike. [Dian Shuai] signaled to [Female General] to be aware that the Taotie behind them was stealthily approaching.
0:41:31|0:41:46|[Female General] and [Dian Shuai] slowly crouched down, each pulling out the dagger and bayonet from their boots, staying vigilant against the Taotie's sneak attacks. [Dian Shuai] felt a lingering fear in his heart, as the Taotie quickly approached the military formation in front.
0:41:46|0:41:51|The marching squad on the main road is surrounded by enemies on both sides, with two ferocious beasts charging simultaneously.
0:41:51|0:41:59|The Female General had long been prepared to produce a short weapon to insert into his eyes, and the glutton behind was killed as soon as it took off, rushing over by inertia.
0:41:59|0:42:5|In the midst of the urgency, [Dian Shuai] pushed aside [Female General] and went straight for the Glutton, only to have half of his shoulder bitten off.
0:42:5|0:42:32|[Counselor Wang] led the troops over, and [Dian Shuai], who was on the verge of collapse, stopped the team. [Counselor Wang] rushed forward to check the situation, and [Dian Shuai] on the stretcher said, "Female General" nodded sadly.
0:42:32|0:42:41|[Dian Shuai] used his last bit of strength to pull out a military token from his waist, slowly handing over a round token with intricate patterns and embedded with gemstones.
0:43:4|0:43:10|In the distance, [William] and another person look complicated.
0:43:19|0:43:25|At that moment, the soldiers in the scene all knelt down to receive the orders, and [William] was also touched by this camaraderie.
0:43:26|0:43:32|In the coffin, [Dian Shuai] is dressed in armor with a sword, while [Female General] gently covers him with exquisite silk.
0:43:33|0:43:40|The soldiers, with solemn expressions and white silk on their heads, slowly pushed the coffin lid closed with the help of two strongmen.
0:43:41|0:43:53|At dawn on the Great Wall, the sky was not yet bright. The sound of drums pierced the morning air. Looking at the soldiers stretching for dozens of miles on the city wall, all of them wore white silk on their heads and bodies.
0:43:53|0:44:2|Warriors lit sky lanterns, and the lanterns floated out one by one. [William] and [Pero] looked in astonishment as hundreds of sky lanterns rose slowly into the sky.
0:46:36|0:46:44|[Pero] angrily said:
0:46:53|0:47:1|After saying that, [William] pushed open the door and walked in, his face hesitant, on the city wall.
0:47:7|0:47:23|In the thick fog, soldiers lined up to prepare anesthetic. The entire Great Wall was shrouded in dense fog, with iron spears faintly visible, and the distant city walls covered in clouds and mist.
0:47:23|0:47:31|The Great Wall stretches out before the still dormant dragon, with General Lin [Dian Shuai] standing by the wall in the army, looking resolute.
0:47:31|0:47:49|Female General's infantrymen carried a huge metal horn in front of the wall. The horn had a wide head like a big pot and was over 6 meters long. It took at least three people to lift the mouth of the horn. It was placed outside the city wall for eavesdropping. Surprisingly, dozens of ladders were set up underneath the horn.
0:47:51|0:47:53|The young soldier hurried to help upon hearing the words.
0:47:54|0:47:59|Commander Dian Shuai looked back at William by the rolling wheel near the city wall, William's expression was complex.
0:47:59|0:48:6|To avoid the gaze of [Dian Shuai], he lowered his head and stirred the wheel, the sound of breaking bowls attracting everyone's attention.
0:48:6|0:48:11|The young soldier looked flustered.
0:48:14|0:48:22|The young soldier's face turned ugly as he took the order and ran off. [William] looked around anxiously by the wheel, realizing that no one was paying attention to him, he turned and headed towards the weapons in the corner.
0:48:22|0:48:30|He came to the corner, picked up the arrow bag, took the hard bow, avoided the soldiers' sight, and quickly left.
0:48:30|0:48:38|On the city wall, [William] briskly walked past the disciplined Imperial Guards, soon encountering a dejected young soldier who had been sent back.
0:48:38|0:48:46|The two exchanged a glance, [William] hesitated to speak, then quickened his pace and left. Inside the stone chamber, [Balade] anxiously waited at the door.
0:49:4|0:49:10|The impatient [Pero] ignored him and quickly walked out of the room, the thick fog on the city wall had not yet dispersed.
0:49:10|0:49:16|At the end of the giant horn, [General Chen] is listening attentively with his ear tilted, while soldiers in different styles of armor are lined up.
0:49:16|0:49:25|Some are clad in heavy armor wielding long spears, some wear soft armor holding spiked shields, and there is even a female soldier in leather armor looking heroic and valiant.
0:49:25|0:49:37|Lined up with crossbowmen and trumpet troops under the wall, wearing cloaks, carrying quivers, and holding strong bows, all showing that this is an elite army.
0:49:38|0:49:51|The horn soldier in front of the wall was suddenly dragged away by the gluttonous and thrown outside the city wall. The gluttonous army, without artillery hindrance, had quietly reached the foot of the city wall under the cover of thick fog.
0:49:54|0:50:5|Iron hooks are tied to a circular ring, with the other end attached to the soldiers of the suicide squad. As the mechanism is pulled inside the wall, cracks open up on the city wall, revealing giant scissors.
0:50:10|0:50:16|The suicide squad, armed with knives and axes, with bags tied around their waists, leaped outside the city wall under the cover of arrows.
0:50:17|0:50:24|This is a pair of scissors being pushed together against the wall, wherever the scissors go, chaos and destruction follow.
0:50:24|0:50:32|The daredevil swung the axe at the glutton, the giant scissors opened and closed, limbs flying everywhere.
0:50:34|0:50:41|On the main road, [William] slowed down his pace and fell into contemplation. The brief experiences of these days had taught him a lot.
0:50:42|0:50:49|Faith, trust, and love for his country emerged in his heart, and he fell into contemplation. On the small path along the city wall,
0:51:6|0:51:18|Balade stood still, Pero turned around to look for William. On the city wall and high platform, soldiers were stirring the pulleys, pulling iron chains, and adjusting the crossbows.
0:51:20|0:51:32|Several dozen harpoon swords flew out with iron chains, drawing perfect arcs in the air. They pierced into the body of the glutton with the momentum of breaking the wind, causing the wounded glutton to howl in pain. The scene repeated itself as they shook their heads in resistance.
0:51:33|0:51:40|The thick iron chain was pulled straight, and the soldiers on the city wall exerted all their strength to hold onto the pulley without letting go.
0:51:40|0:51:45|The city's gluttonous monsters twisted their heads and pulled out harpoons with sharp teeth, assisting each other.
0:51:45|0:51:53|Biting, dragging, or pulling, [William] pulled the harpoon sword out of his companion, causing soldiers on the city wall to fall one after another.
0:51:53|0:51:59|More and more Taotie break free from their restraints, empty harpoons are thrown against the city wall.
0:52:3|0:52:13|Inside the city, [William] had a determined look in his eyes, while [Counselor Wang] became anxious. The last spear sword wobbled, and the soldiers hurried to help. On the city wall, [William] set off with weapons on his back.
0:52:13|0:52:28|The iron chains swayed, and the beast below the city struggled to break free but found it difficult to move an inch. [William] tightly gripped his bow and arrow, striding forward quickly against the crowd on both sides. The fearless city defenders on the wall never hesitated and boldly jumped down.
0:52:38|0:52:50|As the iron chains loosened, the monster below the city was able to move, its limbs trembling, the medicine starting to take effect. [William] observed the swinging of the iron chains.
0:52:59|0:53:27|The huge stone-throwing arm suddenly lifted up, and the scorching fireball whistled through the air, piercing the thick fog and smashing into the gluttonous army, creating a sea of fire. The crowd heard the iron chains swaying and banging against the wall, [William] immediately grabbed a large bundle of stones next to him and tied them around himself with a rope.
0:53:34|0:53:50|Lin [Dian Shuai] explained to [William], who nodded and took two steps back. He then leaped from the city wall with arms outstretched, grabbing onto the iron chain connecting the two Taotie, sliding down in mid-air.
0:53:53|0:54:4|The archers on the city wall passed the signal arrows to each other, with only the arrowheads of the harpoon arrows left. The signal arrows whistled out and the harpoon targets, when hit, revealed their positions with loud cries as they ran.
0:54:4|0:54:9|[William] also managed to slip out safely just as the iron chains were about to fall.
0:54:11|0:54:22|Standing still, [William] did not rush to act. Instead, he held his breath and focused on sensing the position of the surrounding gluttons. After confirming that there was no danger, he took big steps forward towards the sedated glutton.
0:54:23|0:54:40|[William] cautiously prodded the Taotie with arrows twice before bending down to tightly wrap the iron chain around it. After pulling it taut, he shook the chain to signal the soldiers on the city wall.
0:54:40|0:55:5|The soldiers moved quickly, turning the wheels to pull up the iron chains, dragging the monster outside the city slowly. Just as the sound of arrows was heard, in the moment they flew out, [William] shot an arrow at the monster, causing it to fall to the ground. Unexpectedly, another one rushed out from the side, and in a moment of urgency, a long spear pierced its eye. It turned out to be [Pero] who had arrived.
0:55:10|0:55:17|The iron chains on the city wall are still stirring, and the mist is heavy below the wall. Two people each hold a wooden axe, cautiously observing their surroundings.
0:55:24|0:55:32|Two figures twisted and threw flying axes, the two axes collided in mid-air. With a clang of arrows, the monster burst out of the mist, and [William] immediately shot three arrows in a row.
0:55:32|0:55:34|Successive hits in the eyes.
0:55:34|0:55:45|[Pero] threw the board axe upwards, [William] shot at it continuously with his bow, attracting the Taotie with sound. [Pero] took the opportunity to throw the board axe, splitting it on the head, and then the arrows shot into the Taotie's eyes.
0:55:45|0:56:9|The outer fires are getting stronger, with some monsters breaking through. [Pero] draws his twin swords, ready to fight to the death, while [William] retreats and picks up arrows, shooting towards the sky. On the city wall, [Dian Shuai] immediately understands.
0:56:10|0:56:35|Soldiers ran up with a wooden box, which turned out to be weapons made of black gunpowder, including arrows and cannons. The soldiers, in perfect formation, defended desperately against [William] and the others. The fiery Taotie charged towards them, but they dodged and lay down. A Thunderbolt Sword fell at the feet of the Taotie, exploding and shattering its body, even knocking down the two of them.
0:56:35|0:56:41|William slowly climbed up, every two steps he took, a bomb fell not far away, causing rocks to fly everywhere.
0:56:41|0:56:46|Under the tremendous impact, the two of them staggered and could only crawl towards each other.
0:56:46|0:56:52|In the smoke, the gluttonous beast attacked, but was shot by the Thunderbolt Sword as soon as it leaped up, instantly exploding into pieces of flesh.
0:56:53|0:57:1|[William] and [Pero] were also knocked down by the powerful wave of energy. As Pero struggled to get up, he leaned on his sword and managed to open a door on the city wall.
0:57:2|0:57:9|Delirious [Pero] mistook it for a gluttonous monster swinging a sword in the air, as two rows of soldiers ran out from the stone gate.
0:57:9|0:57:14|In the distance, [William] is on the verge of losing consciousness, while the artillery in the sky continues to roar.
0:57:16|0:57:25|Clusters of mushroom clouds rose in the sky, as [William] groggily saw [Pero] being rescued in the distance, finally unable to support himself and collapsing to the ground, losing consciousness.
0:57:27|0:57:37|In the gentle light, [William] slowly opened his eyes and found someone beside him. He suddenly sat up and upon closer inspection, realized it was a soldier who had been treating him.
0:57:37|0:57:45|William finally noticed Dian Shuai sitting beside him, smiling but not saying a word. After confirming it was safe, William breathed a sigh of relief and said:
0:57:54|0:58:1|Lin [Dian Shuai] looked at [William], who was bare-chested with terrifying scars on his front and back, his expression slightly changing.
0:58:1|0:58:28|[William] absentmindedly rummaged through his clothes, [William] furrowed his brow in thought for a moment, while straightening his clothes, he said: Facing the questioning gaze of [Dian Shuai], he nodded and said: [William] gazed at [Dian Shuai], then turned to look at the black powder in his fingertips.
0:58:31|0:58:41|[William] nodded, looking at [Dian Shuai] with confusion.
0:58:58|0:59:17|[William] finished speaking and looked towards [Dian Shuai]. In the dim light, [Dian Shuai] had a complex expression, nodded in agreement, then stood up and looked at [William] solemnly, saying: [William] gazed at [Dian Shuai], who did not respond. [Dian Shuai] then turned around and walked away briskly.
0:59:17|0:59:20|[William] looked at the figure's back with some confusion.
0:59:20|0:59:27|At night, the city walls were lit with fire, and inside the iron cage, the beast roared. Outside the iron cage, heavily armed soldiers stood facing each other with long spears.
0:59:27|0:59:49|Counselor Wang, holding a long pole with a magnet attached at one end, slowly approached the iron cage. Inside, the ferocious beast roared and violently slammed against the cage. Counselor Wang stopped, extended the pole with both hands, allowing the magnet to slowly approach the beast in the cage, which immediately quieted down.
0:59:49|0:59:58|The censor on the side showed a pleased expression, and [Dian Shuai] and the surrounding generals and soldiers were extremely surprised, while the censor clapped and cheered.
1:0:13|1:0:23|On the night-colored city street, soldiers in iron armor marched in formation. The high-ranking official sat on his chair and saw the iron cage behind him, a smile creeping onto his lips.
1:0:24|1:0:33|The sound of hooves fades away as the convoy disappears into the night. In the stone corridor, [William] stealthily approaches, passing by a room where a young soldier is washing dishes.
1:0:33|1:0:45|The young soldier looked up at [William], who nodded affirmatively. The soldier looked puzzled, but [William] nodded again before turning around and striding away.
1:0:45|1:1:0|William stopped in front of the wooden door, pushed it gently, stepped into the room where his friend Pero was sitting. William looked at Pero, who ignored him. William casually closed the door.
1:1:0|1:1:20|After glancing at [Pero], he walked into the room. [Pero] coldly said, [William] sat down with a thud, staring at [Pero] and said, [Pero] sneered at this, and [William] felt he had gone too far.
1:2:18|1:2:25|[William] grabbed [Pero] by the chest and forcefully pushed him against the wall, holding a dagger to his throat.
1:2:29|1:2:49|[William] put away his fierce look and set down the dagger, casually sticking it into the table. Then he walked out, as an announcement came from the Great Wall in the night.
1:3:1|1:3:19|On the city wall, cavalry lined up and galloped, their hooves shattering the calm night. The torches in the hands of the Forbidden Army spread light along the wide Great Wall. Suddenly, the outer city wall was illuminated as a giant fire lamp was dropped down by an iron chain, followed by soldiers swiftly descending from the wall with flying ropes.
1:3:19|1:3:26|Shuttles of arrows were launched, figures flashed by, and the vertical outer wall of the city looked like a walk in the park for the Imperial Guards.
1:3:26|1:3:38|Further down the steep cliff, there were stone trees and hemp ropes falling. The Imperial Guard descended along the hemp ropes to the cave at the bottom of the cliff. Beside them, Counselor Wang held a torch to explore, while inside the stone chamber, Balade opened a gap in the wall.
1:3:38|1:3:48|[Pero] approaches the candle and quickly removes it.
1:3:48|1:3:56|In the cave, hundreds of imperial guards held torches, illuminating the huge cave which was five to six meters wide and seemingly bottomless.
1:3:57|1:4:3|[William] walked into the stone room, looking around at the empty space, [William] realized that something was amiss.
1:4:4|1:4:11|In the corner of the wall, the gap is particularly eye-catching. In the city, two disguised soldiers are secretly observing behind a stone pillar.
1:4:11|1:4:21|After the soldiers left, the two of them quietly followed, sneaking past the small soldiers in the kitchen, hiding and dodging along the way, until they arrived at a large iron gate.
1:4:21|1:4:30|[Balade] put down the burden, took out the prepared black powder from it, untied the rope and hung it on the iron chain. He gently straightened the fuse.
1:4:40|1:4:53|The match in the stone room lit up, the fuse ignited, [Balade] quickly retreated, while [Pero] also hid behind the iron roof and peeked out to look at the iron door. The fuse was about to burn out but didn't explode, only emitting a few sparks before going silent.
1:4:57|1:5:35|Behind the bronze tripod, two figures poked their heads out again. Upon hearing the words, [Pero] walked forward, while [William] ran towards another passage. The soldier washing dishes in the kitchen stopped, untied his apron, and nervously rushed out, catching up with [William] in quick steps. He hesitated briefly at the stairs, then hurried off again. The entrance was a mess, with [Pero] and the others sitting on the ground. [Balade] patted [Pero].
1:5:45|1:5:51|Balade casually comforted [Pero], throwing the sack to him, and the two cooperated to fill the bag with gunpowder.
1:5:51|1:5:57|[Pero] suddenly stopped and looked towards the door, Balade followed his gaze and saw it was [William].
1:6:50|1:7:5|Balade cut the rope near the wall corner, causing the black powder hanging high to hit [William]. They both carried sacks of black powder and left the cave.
1:7:41|1:7:57|In the desert, two men and three horses gallop wildly, reaching a hill where they both stop their horses and look back at Chang'an, the ancient eastern dragon. Just as dawn breaks over Bianjing City, the imperial convoy of fast horses rushes through the Meridian Gate towards the palace.
1:7:59|1:8:11|At a glance, the majestic imperial city with its grand city gates, towering walls, wide roads, and exquisite pagodas, the palace adorned with carved beams and painted rafters, the young emperor curiously stepped down from the dragon throne.
1:8:13|1:8:20|The concubines on both sides and civil and military officials slowly approached, covered with iron cages wrapped in sackcloth, emitting bursts of sobbing.
1:8:20|1:8:39|The young emperor descended the steps, and the [Imperial Guard Commander] pulled aside the cloth, revealing a terrifying appearance that made the officials gasp and retreat. The young emperor gave a questioning look to [Officer Shen], who then gestured for the emperor to come forward and inspect closely. Frowning, the young emperor approached to carefully examine the sharp teeth and claws of the terrifying creature.
1:8:59|1:9:8|General Wu shouted angrily in the military camp, William was twisted and thrown to the ground, and General Dian Shuai walked over quickly with an unhappy expression.
1:9:9|1:9:17|[William] was tied up with his hands behind his back, sitting on the ground, while [Dian Shuai] rushed over, trembling with anger.
1:10:5|1:10:15|[Dian Shuai] turned to look at [William], unable to help but consider whether what [William] had just said was true.
1:10:16|1:10:23|The young soldier was just about to speak when he was lifted up by [General Wu].
1:10:25|1:10:30|General Wu angrily pushed away the young soldier and looked towards Dian Shuai, as Dian Shuai made up his mind.
1:10:33|1:10:39|He looked at [William], who met his gaze with a determined expression, while General Lin [Dian Shuai] looked away.
1:10:43|1:10:47|He finished speaking and walked away quickly.
1:10:49|1:10:57|The huge prison gate opened, [William] was thrown into the cell, and [William] sighed unwillingly.
1:10:57|1:11:22|On the desert, [Balade] and [Pero] rode horses carrying black powder. They reached a crossroads, with [Pero] looking around. [Balade] pointed upwards, and [Pero] dismounted and climbed up the rocky slope. As [Balade] watched the figure in the distance, he pulled the reins and ran off with the black powder.
1:11:24|1:11:43|[Pero] was furious. Soldiers on the city wall poured black powder into the bellows, pulled the handle, and created a rough hot air balloon that slowly took off.
1:11:43|1:12:11|Black smoke rises along the entire Great Wall, fierce winds blowing each hot air balloon. [William] hears a strange noise and quickly gets up to look out the window. A massive hot air balloon crashes, debris scattering in all directions. Another balloon explodes in the sky, soldiers falling from the air. General [Dian Shuai] commands the troops.
1:12:18|1:12:29|The hot air balloon swayed as it floated towards the distance, with [William] standing on it, overlooking the majestic Great Wall. Fires were blazing, and numerous hot air balloons were falling with thick smoke.
1:12:34|1:12:44|The young soldier at the prison door anxiously unlocks the door, pulls the latch, and opens the cell. [William] walks out slowly from the cell, and the soldier smiles at him.
1:12:45|1:12:52|[William] runs through the crowd on the city wall, and hurries to find [Counselor Wang].
1:13:7|1:13:15|Counselor Wang looks at the hot air balloon flying into the distance.
1:13:33|1:13:55|[Counselor Wang] said helplessly, [William] turned and left after a moment of contemplation, but stopped abruptly after taking a few steps. He looked back at the few scattered hot air balloons floating in the sky, a sudden realization dawned on him - perhaps they were carrying the last hope of the people.
1:14:4|1:14:13|General hands over the armor and arrows with both hands, William takes them.
1:14:18|1:14:31|[Counselor Wang] sought the opinion of [William], while in the wilderness [Balade] was holding three wild horses. Suddenly, the voices of the Khitan people could be heard approaching. In the blink of an eye, dozens of riders had already arrived, surrounding [Balade].
1:14:31|1:14:40|In the grand hall, [Officer Shen] slowly takes out a magnet from the iron cage.
1:14:52|1:15:21|[Officer] slowly retreated with a magnet in hand, marking down nine feet. The fierce beast in the cage suddenly caught sight, flew towards [Officer] with the iron cage, and threw it out. The beast used the brown fur on its back to pass on information. On the wilderness, the beast army was galloping, and the beast king suddenly stopped, raised its horns to send a signal. Thousands of beast army suddenly changed direction and ran eastward.
1:15:22|1:15:32|Leading the way are [William] and [Balade], this team is vast and mighty, advancing like a tide, heading towards Bianliang.
1:15:32|1:15:44|In the bustling city, unaware of the impending disaster, the beast in the iron cage struggled on the grand hall. The [Officer Shen] on the ground threw a magnet, which stuck to the iron cage, finally calming the beast down.
1:15:44|1:15:53|The huge hot air balloon gently drifted down from the sky, with [Counselor Wang] tightly holding onto the direction while the young soldiers worked hard to operate the bellows.
1:15:53|1:15:58|[William] looked at the dilapidated town beneath his feet, with flames soaring into the sky, furrowing his brow involuntarily.
1:16:7|1:16:36|By the desert campfire, the Khitan people poured gourds filled with gunpowder together. Beside them, [Balade] had his mouth blocked and couldn't warn about the danger of the gunpowder. The Khitan people tossed the gourds back and forth until one rolled into the fire. [Balade] panicked as the fuse was quickly ignited, and the explosion startled [Pero] in the distance.
1:16:37|1:16:57|He got up and ran towards the direction of the explosion. Dozens of hot air balloons were coming with the wind in the sky above Bianliang. Groups of gluttons were running wildly on the imperial city road, climbing walls and leaping from rooftops to pounce on the hot air balloons.
1:16:57|1:17:5|The Forbidden Army shooting arrows actually attracted the siege of the gluttons. The gluttons leaped up, dragged down the archers, and they died immediately upon landing.
1:17:5|1:17:14|The Taotie, having tasted the sweetness, became more ferocious and pounced towards the sky. [Dian Shuai] stabbed with his spear to stop the Taotie's attack, but ended up falling to the ground himself.
1:17:14|1:17:17|The soldiers jumped down one after another to assist in the battle.
1:17:25|1:17:35|The female soldier kicked the wall and retreated, then made a move with a backstabbing spear, killing the glutton but being carried away by the airborne glutton. [Dian Shuai] pursued, only to be surrounded by more gluttons.
1:17:36|1:17:45|The Taoties slowly tightened the encirclement, [Dian Shuai] slowly retreated with a spear in hand, and the voice of [William] came from the hot air balloon.
1:17:45|1:18:1|[Dian Shuai] raised the spear with one hand, [William] grabbed the spear in mid-air, lifted [Dian Shuai] into the air, and ignited the thunder bomb.
1:18:7|1:18:14|[Dian Shuai] took over and threw, shattering five or six Taoties.
1:18:15|1:18:31|[William] took the opportunity to drag [Dian Shuai] into the hot air balloon. Looking down, the beasts formed a circle, feeding the beast king in the center.
1:18:39|1:18:47|The hot air balloon was torn by the eaves, swaying and falling into the crowd behind the hall, and the rolling hot air balloon was pierced by a spear.
1:18:53|1:19:10|[Dian Shuai] and others stood up to find themselves surrounded by the [Imperial Guard Commander]. [Dian Shuai] took out the military token, and the hall was already in chaos. Leading the troops through the front hall, [Dian Shuai] proudly arrived in front of the hall, with palace maids fleeing on both sides of the dragon throne.
1:19:18|1:19:26|The old eunuch walked to the dragon throne and called for the young emperor to come out. The young emperor, dressed in a dragon robe and a golden crown, slowly emerged half of his body, frowning and shouting loudly:
1:19:52|1:19:56|The old eunuch carefully helped the emperor sit back on the dragon throne.
1:20:17|1:20:31|In the desert, [Pero] is playing with the black gunpowder he picked up, with three spirited horses dragging the gunpowder beside him. He sits alone in the desert.
1:20:31|1:20:39|Further away, a pair of shadowless Imperial Guards came galloping towards them. [Pero], whose eyes were still blinded by greed, had not yet realized the seriousness of the situation.
1:20:54|1:21:2|The Qilin is covered in black powder bombs, with the Imperial Guard Commander leading the way in the dungeon, William at the front.
1:21:2|1:21:10|The Forbidden Army pushes a small cart, on which a Taotie is tightly bound by iron chains. Suddenly, a voice comes from above.
1:21:14|1:21:24|[Counselor Wang] signaled to stop, and everyone looked up through the sturdy net to see the Taotie running above their heads. [Dian Shuai] gestured for everyone to remain silent.
1:21:24|1:21:33|Counselor Wang waved his hand to signal everyone to move forward slowly, not to startle anyone. Everyone cautiously walked forward and finally arrived at a doorway, stepping in gently.
1:21:33|1:21:37|Everything suddenly became clear inside.
1:21:39|1:21:51|Inside was a pagoda, with spiral staircases on both sides. Looking up, it was eight or nine stories high. Suddenly, a monster reached through the bars and grabbed the soldiers in the dungeon.
1:21:52|1:21:58|The soldier was hoisted high up, [William] vigorously swung his spear, cutting off the monster's arm. The soldier fell down, and everyone rushed forward to check the situation.
1:22:2|1:22:6|Counselor Wang rushes to the injured young soldier beyond the carriage.
1:22:6|1:22:14|The young soldier struggled in pain, the blood on his shoulder staining the iron armor red. [William] crouched down and gently opened the torn armor.
1:22:21|1:22:25|[Dian Shuai] nodded, and everyone stood up and left.
1:22:25|1:22:40|Inside the pagoda, two small carts, one carrying a gluttonous beast and the other carrying pork, slowly come to a stop. The people approach and crouch down to untie the beast, while cries can be heard from the dungeon passage.
1:22:41|1:22:44|The crowd picked up their weapons and got ready.
1:22:44|1:22:52|The soldier in the corner slowly climbed up, picked up a string of exploding arrows, lit the fuse, and left behind a smile as he turned around.
1:22:53|1:22:56|Just as [William] launched an attack,
1:22:59|1:23:13|A huge explosion sent rocks flying everywhere. As everyone looked on, the passage to the dungeon was completely blocked by the rubble, leaving everyone staring sadly at the pile of stones. Underneath the pile lay the young warrior who would never return.
1:23:13|1:23:32|[Counselor Wang] lifted the latch, slowly opened a crack, and peered through it as the gluttonous figure roamed around. [Dian Shuai] signaled for [Counselor Wang] to open the door wide. [Counselor Wang] gently picked up a magnet, held his breath, slowly stepped back, and moved around to the side of the crowd.
1:23:32|1:23:56|He exchanged glances with [Dian Shuai] and took two steps back, the three of them staring at the glutton on the cart. It suddenly opened its eyes, moved its body, slowly stood up, turned its head to glare at the three of them, howled and stepped forward. [William] raised his hand and drew an arrow to guard against any sneak attacks.
1:23:57|1:24:6|Counselor Wang held the magnet, intimidating the Taotie from advancing.
1:24:9|1:24:19|The Taotie growled and climbed onto the cart, [William] put away his bow and arrow, and everyone watched the Taotie warily as it sniffed the pork in front of it and took a big bite.
1:24:29|1:24:37|The three of them ran out of the door and looked around at the trace of the Taotie.
1:24:37|1:24:42|The Beast King is surrounded by thousands of gluttons on the square.
1:24:44|1:24:51|The Female General acted as a guard, the strong Female General grabbed it and examined it closely before throwing it to the ground.
1:24:51|1:24:55|It retracts the bat, clears the way, and allows it to deliver food to the beast king.
1:24:55|1:25:0|Suddenly, a Taotie noticed the three of them, and [Counselor Wang] held up a magnet to deter it.
1:25:0|1:25:8|The crowd hurriedly retreated and closed the gate. It was only a matter of time before they were discovered and attacked. The three of them looked up at the top of the tower simultaneously.
1:25:10|1:25:15|The sound of the door being smashed came, [Counselor Wang] quickly walked to the door and raised the magnet.
1:25:17|1:25:26|[Dian Shuai] picked up the grappling hook, grabbed a spear and followed [William], while [Counselor Wang] held a magnet in one hand and a knife in the other, watching the two go upstairs.
1:25:26|1:25:33|They walked through the magnificent staircase to the window, opened a gap and looked down.
1:25:33|1:25:47|Groups of gluttons fed the Beast King, [William] drew his exploding sword, pulled back his hard bow one after another, lit the fuse, and shot an arrow.
1:25:51|1:25:57|The bat demon spread its wings and deflected the arrows, the explosion startled the beast king who was eating.
1:25:57|1:26:1|The Taotie looked around for humans and quickly closed the window.
1:26:3|1:26:15|After the two of them finished speaking, they rushed up the stairs. On the square, the Beast King looked around, trembling its horns, giving orders. Groups of gluttons attacked two high towers, while inside one tower stood [Counselor Wang] guarding the entrance.
1:26:16|1:26:22|The Taoties broke in from above, and [Counselor Wang] knew that guarding the gate was meaningless.
1:26:24|1:26:31|After saying that, he threw the magnet up, and [Dian Shuai] extended his spear to attract the magnet.
1:26:31|1:26:39|Dian Shuai looked tearfully at the already fallen base of the pagoda as more and more gluttons broke in through the windows on the lower floors.
1:26:39|1:26:47|[William] no longer hesitated, quickly walked upstairs, arrived at a window, opened it, and locked onto the location of the bomb-devouring monster.
1:26:47|1:26:53|He pulled the bowstring with a determined look, lit the fuse, and released the arrow.
1:26:54|1:27:3|The sword whistled past and struck the bomb on the Taotie, only to be deflected once again by the spread wings.
1:27:5|1:27:11|The angry Beast King looked up at [William] on the rooftop, signaling the Taotie to attack.
1:27:11|1:27:16|Thousands of Taotie creatures surged towards the pagoda of [William].
1:27:28|1:27:47|[William] stepped forward and pulled the magnet off the spear, the two of them gathered together to straighten the flying rope, lit the fuse, swung out the pagoda. And at that moment, countless demons rushed in and pounced on the two in the air, the rope drawing graceful arcs in the sky.
1:27:47|1:27:51|Ten bloodthirsty mouths flew towards them, but did not harm the two of them in the slightest.
1:27:51|1:28:18|[William] raised the magnet and threw it into the heart of the beast pack, followed closely by spears tied with black powder. The magnet prevented the wings from spreading, the spear pierced the beast king, biting it off, all the bombs detonated simultaneously, overturning the core of the beast pack. [William] and [Dian Shuai] crashed through the window, rolling down from the eaves. In the urgency, [Dian Shuai] grabbed the eaves with one hand and caught [William] in mid-air with the other hand.
1:28:21|1:28:31|[William] struggled to turn in the air and grabbed onto the eaves with one foot. With [Dian Shuai] pulling hard, [William] clung on with both arms tightly, and with [Dian Shuai]'s assistance, the two of them climbed onto the eaves.
1:28:31|1:28:35|But [William] accidentally stepped on a tile and smashed it onto the glutton.
1:28:36|1:28:47|The 10-meter-high army of gluttonous beasts collapsed like a mountain landslide. [Dian Shuai] showed a look of relief, signaling the success of the plan to kill the Beast King. As recorded in historical documents, after the Beast King's death,
1:28:47|1:28:49|The Taotie stopped moving.
1:28:49|1:29:1|The stiff and tough tao tie at the moment is the best proof, they saved the people and the world in times of crisis, the nine states will no longer suffer from their disturbance, and the world will be stable.
1:29:4|1:29:14|The warhorse galloped in the yellow sand, heading towards the majestic Great Wall. The leader of the pack, a tall and majestic horse, is none other than [William].
1:29:14|1:29:20|They walked towards the prison gate, the soldier unlocked the door, [William] looked at [Pero] bound in iron chains.
1:29:21|1:29:25|[Pero] slowly looked up and saw [William], he's still alive!
1:29:28|1:29:37|[William] pursed his lips and walked forward, looking at [Pero] with a complex expression. He smiled and said:
1:30:32|1:30:40|[William] smiled and took out a key, walking up to unlock the door for [Pero].
1:30:48|1:31:2|[William] suddenly stopped, it turned out to be Lin [Dian Shuai] walking towards him on the stairs, [Pero] looked around anxiously. Saying that, [Pero] returned to the cell, and casually closed the cell door behind him.
1:31:2|1:31:11|Lin [Dian Shuai] climbed up the steps in armor and stood before [William].
1:31:30|1:31:36|Pero's complaint made the two of them unable to help laughing.
1:31:42|1:31:47|[Dian Shuai] lowered his head and remained silent for a moment.
1:31:49|1:31:59|Lin [Dian Shuai] nodded, and the procession of carriages and horses outside the Great Wall moved forward in a line, winding along the narrow path, exuding a majestic aura.
1:31:59|1:32:17|The troops of the Great Wall marched with such grandeur, the procession slowly came to a halt. Leading the way, [William] and [Pero] looked back at the Great Wall with mixed emotions. The former Female General on the wall has now been promoted to the rank of Female General of the Cavalry.
