0:2:1|0:2:8|Xiaoyou placed the treasure map on the table, attracting the attention of two individuals.
0:2:8|0:2:11|[Hu Zi] immediately took out his phone and started filming together.
0:2:15|0:2:24|Yang Jiacheng has a complex terrain. In the past five years, many masters in the circle have tried to overthrow him, but all ended in failure.
0:2:29|0:2:38|[Heizi] gave a glance and the cold bodyguard beside him immediately took out a safe and placed it in front of [Alliance Leader].
0:2:45|0:2:51|Hu Zi actually found a photo of the Alliance Leader's wife and son in the pile of money.
0:2:51|0:2:56|The Alliance Leader looked at the photo, feeling a tightness in his heart.
0:3:33|0:3:37|[Hu Zi] was handed the item, and tensions rose in the scene.
0:3:37|0:3:44|[Alliance Leader] hurriedly put the jade pendant and treasure map into the bag, then led [Hu Zi] away.
0:3:44|0:3:51|Miao Zi, who had been waiting outside for a long time, finally saw the appearance of Alliance Leader and hurriedly followed their footsteps.
0:4:36|0:4:41|The truth of this escape route is worth [Miao Zi]'s deep consideration.
0:4:41|0:4:47|The Alliance Leader then took off Miao Zi's glasses and placed them on the ground, his actions filled with threats.
0:4:47|0:4:51|[Alliance Leader] kicked [Miao Zi] in the face, completely shattering his loyalty towards him.
0:4:54|0:4:59|The two brothers, [Alliance Leader] and [Hu Zi], left gracefully, leaving [Miao Zi] to plan a new path for himself in his heart.
0:4:59|0:5:5|An excellent opportunity arose, and [Hu Zi] casually handed the package containing the treasure map to [Miao Zi].
0:5:5|0:5:12|[Miao Zi] took out the treasure map and jade pendant, put them in his pocket, and then casually got on the car as if nothing had happened.
0:5:12|0:5:16|In the car, [Miao Zi] slammed on the brakes, venting his dissatisfaction with the two brothers, [Alliance Leader].
0:5:18|0:5:19|It is obvious that [Miao Zi] did it on purpose.
0:5:22|0:5:28|The Alliance Leader forces Miao Zi out of the car, then drives away leaving Miao Zi behind at the camp.
0:5:28|0:5:35|The handsome [Alliance Leader] exudes a relaxed atmosphere amidst the tension here.
0:5:38|0:5:44|A person rides a spirited horse, galloping passionately on the racetrack.
0:5:44|0:5:48|The horses gradually stopped their galloping hooves, bringing [Alliance Leader] and the others back to the real world's troubles.
0:5:50|0:5:56|The loss of the treasure map troubles their Daoist beliefs.
0:5:56|0:6:11|[Hu Zi] dialed [Miao Zi]'s number again, but the unanswered tone made him furrow his brows, and he couldn't help but curse under his breath.
0:6:11|0:6:12|[Alliance Leader] also made the call.
0:6:19|0:6:24|It is obvious that [Miao Zi] has seen through the deception of the [Alliance Leader] and chooses to leave.
0:6:26|0:6:31|The Alliance Leader couldn't help but mutter to himself.
0:6:36|0:6:42|[Miao Zi] Various abnormal signs pointed to him as the prime suspect in the disappearance of the treasure map.
0:6:50|0:6:53|Wu Zi's first suspicion target is [Miao Zi].
0:6:53|0:7:10|By the poolside, accompanied by melodious music, the graceful beauty emerged from the water and walked towards the shore.
0:7:12|0:7:21|Every step Xianxian took seemed to tread on [Xiao Xiaotian]'s heart, and he, standing on the shore, had already fixed his gaze on Xianxian.
0:7:21|0:7:30|[Xiao Xiaotian] stared at Xianxian's every step, showing a look of infatuation. Every frown and smile of Xianxian was a picturesque scenery.
0:7:30|0:7:36|Seeing Xianxian walk ashore, he quickly approached and struck up a conversation with her in Taiwanese.
0:7:49|0:7:53|Xianxian intentionally looked at [Xiao Xiaotian] with deep affection in her eyes.
0:7:59|0:8:3|On the bank, two people gazed into the distance under an umbrella, with a hint of romance and warmth.
0:8:6|0:8:11|A luxury car stopped at the entrance of the Wuzhou International Hotel, and a man and a woman got out of the car.
0:8:11|0:8:15|With such an imposing demeanor, this man is not to be trifled with.
0:8:15|0:8:22|The man's name is [Zhang Renfa].
0:8:22|0:8:28|[Xiao Xiaotian] personally came downstairs to greet, further highlighting his extraordinary identity as a man.
0:8:28|0:8:31|Several people then walked up the stairs, ready to discuss the mysterious transaction.
0:8:35|0:8:43|[Xiao Xiaotian] and the others had just walked up the stairs when the Mengchu brothers entered the hotel right after them.
0:8:53|0:8:59|With a few knocks on the door, a burly man walked into the room, bringing [Xiao Xiaotian] some good news.
0:9:4|0:9:9|[Xiao Xiaotian] took out the safe and deliberately opened it in front of everyone.
0:9:13|0:9:16|[Zhang Renfa] stared at the box of money, lost in thought.
0:9:40|0:9:48|Obviously, [Zhang Renfa] has been fooled by [Xiao Xiaotian]'s manipulation and decides to buy the vase.
0:10:4|0:10:8|Brother Fa carefully held the vase in his hands as if it were a treasure.
0:10:14|0:10:17|Completely forgetting about the lover beside him, [Xiao Qian].
0:10:17|0:10:20|Wu Dalang unexpectedly returned to the room with 600,000 in hand.
0:10:20|0:10:22|[Xiao Xiaotian] warmly greeted him to take a seat.
0:10:35|0:10:41|Warlord Wu was full of expectations, helping [Xiao Xiaotian] to negotiate such a big deal.
0:10:41|0:10:47|Xiao Xiaotian of the Empty Door unexpectedly only gave him a hundred yuan as his hard work fee.
0:10:47|0:10:51|Xianxian curiously opens the safe, wanting to feast her eyes on the huge sum of money.
0:10:51|0:10:55|Unexpectedly, a huge mystery was discovered during the search.
0:11:38|0:11:50|The Alliance Leader looked at the photos taken by Hu Zi and found the approximate location of the treasure sword.
0:11:50|0:11:52|The Alliance Leader is worried about the lack of hiding spots.
0:12:11|0:12:22|At a critical moment, [Hu Zi] unexpectedly had a sudden realization and shouted [Miao Zi]'s name out loud.
0:12:22|0:12:27|After a passionate exchange between the two, [Miao Zi] proudly shows off his precious loot to Qianqian.
0:12:30|0:12:34|Qianqian tied up this jade-skinned cultivator, her face showing complete indifference.
0:12:47|0:12:49|At the mention of antiques, Qianqian became interested.
0:13:0|0:13:2|Yaozi is already envisioning the life before and after.
0:13:13|0:13:15|Qianqian knew well that her identity was awkward.
0:14:3|0:14:4|Qianqian only cares about money.
0:14:20|0:14:24|The next morning, Yao went to the main street to post small advertisements.
0:14:24|0:14:26|The advertisement prominently reads, "Seeking help with true feelings."
0:14:28|0:14:31|Before long, the street was filled with advertising slogans.
0:14:31|0:14:34|[Miao Zi] is still not satisfied and continues on.
0:14:34|0:14:39|The arrival of a police car at the corner interrupted [Miao Zi]'s continued footsteps.
0:14:46|0:14:54|Minjie in the police car is telling the vendor about the precautions during patrol. When she mentions being thirsty, she hands the vendor a bottle of drink.
0:14:54|0:15:0|During a break, Min's attention was drawn to the advertisement on the utility pole while drinking water.
0:15:0|0:15:10|The vendor followed and then opened the car door, walked up, leaned his hand on the pillar, and carefully observed the content of the advertisement.
0:15:24|0:15:30|In front of the remote cave, [Hu Zi] cried falsely and was slapped into the cave by [Alliance Leader].
0:15:30|0:15:35|The two of them entered the remote cave sneakily, while keeping a close eye on the surroundings, fully alert.
0:15:51|0:16:2|In the bar, the trio of [Donggua] is drinking and having fun recklessly. [Donggua] opens a capsule pill, pours the powder onto a piece of paper, and then swallows it in one gulp.
0:16:8|0:16:11|[Donggua] was about to pick up the bottle of wine and swallow the medicine.
0:16:11|0:16:16|[An Zai] intervened directly, and the aggrieved [Donggua] had no choice but to obediently drink the water.
0:16:16|0:16:20|[Donggua] stared foolishly at the couple singing together next to him, with a silly grin on his face.
0:16:21|0:16:29|The next moment, the two embraced passionately, with [Donggua] watching in fascination. Inadvertently, he knocked over a bottle of wine, interrupting the two deeply engrossed in the moment.
0:16:29|0:16:38|The two interrupted individuals were a bit shy, looking around with their eyes, not daring to look directly at each other, but the smiles at the corners of their mouths revealed the feelings of both sides.
0:16:38|0:16:44|The two of them held hands and left in unison, leaving [Donggua] alone in the room to amuse himself.
0:16:44|0:16:50|Outside the door, the two were about to fall into an ambiguous atmosphere, but the arrival of several uninvited guests made them flee in a panic.
0:17:0|0:17:9|Simple-minded [Donggua] managed to grab snacks on the table even in the midst of a life-threatening escape, truly a genuine foodie.
0:17:9|0:17:14|Three people are desperately running ahead, with others closely chasing behind.
0:17:17|0:17:20|In the narrow space, only the echoing sound of footsteps can be heard.
0:17:23|0:17:30|Several people hurriedly ran into a warehouse, hoping to borrow some miscellaneous items to evade the pursuit behind them.
0:17:30|0:17:37|Donggua ran past the cardboard boxes, still not forgetting to knock them down, creating obstacles for the people chasing behind.
0:17:37|0:17:45|At this moment, the three of them passed by the kitchen, and [Donggua] casually locked the door, trying to cut off the people behind them.
0:17:45|0:17:50|It is obvious that the locked door did not help at all, as the pursuers behind easily opened it.
0:17:53|0:18:2|[Donggua] from the alliance picked up a plate and threw it behind him, while also grabbing a lamb leg to replenish his energy.
0:18:2|0:18:16|The pursuers crossed the obstacles and chased after the crowd. [Donggua] calmly ate a lamb leg while running away. When he reached the door, he closed it and then used the lamb leg to prop it shut.
0:18:16|0:18:21|With this move, the pursuers were completely isolated inside the house, and [Donggua] and the other two managed to safely shake off the crowd.
0:18:24|0:18:29|[Donggua] ran past a sedan, then suddenly returned to the side of the car.
0:18:29|0:18:36|With hands on hips, glaring fiercely at the young boy in the car, looking like he's about to strike.
0:18:36|0:18:40|The little boy, under threat, had his lollipop taken away by [Donggua].
0:18:40|0:18:48|[Donggua] happily ate candies and ran around contentedly.
0:18:48|0:18:53|While Donggua was resting on the side of the road, Sha Sha quickly asked how much money An Zi owed.
0:19:11|0:19:15|[Sha Sha] was suddenly at a loss and didn't know what to do.
0:19:15|0:19:18|[Donggua] was attracted by the flag on the utility pole.
0:19:21|0:19:34|Unbeknownst to her, the man passing by also looked at the utility pole, but he was drawn to the heartfelt players on top. He then dialed the player's phone number.
0:20:14|0:20:20|In the mall, [Sha Sha] closely followed the man on the elevator and, taking advantage of his distraction, skillfully stole his phone.
0:20:24|0:20:29|On the other side, [An Zai] is also searching for the target to strike.
0:20:29|0:20:40|Sha Sha pretended to bend down to tie his shoelaces, and his dagger cut through the man's outer bag, causing the wallet inside to fall out.
0:20:40|0:20:48|[An Zai] slipped the wallet into his chest and then tossed it to [Donggua] who was snacking by the pillar, showing their perfect coordination.
0:20:52|0:21:1|At this moment, [Sha Sha] also returned to the meeting point of the three people, proudly handing the stolen phone to Donghua for safekeeping.
0:21:21|0:21:27|Xiao Xiaotian and Sha Sha passed by [Donggua], becoming their next target for theft.
0:21:27|0:21:38|[An Zai] gestured to [Donggua], who understood immediately and followed Xianxian, looking for the opportunity to steal.
0:21:38|0:21:46|[Donggua] used the lollipop in his hand to throw the phone out of Xianxian's pocket, removed the phone case, and found it was an iPhone, secretly feeling pleased with himself.
0:21:51|0:21:57|Little did they know, the phone suddenly rang.
0:21:57|0:22:0|Xianxian turned around and found the phone in the hands of [Donggua].
0:22:31|0:22:39|With Xianxian's shout, the security guards chased closely behind [Donggua], Chun Chun, and Pure, forcing the three of them to run for their lives.
0:22:39|0:22:43|After a chase, [Donggua] and [An Zai] were almost caught by the security guards.
0:22:48|0:23:1|The security guards watched the three escaping individuals with anger. As the saying goes, enemies meet with extra jealousy. [Xiao Xiaotian] and [Sha Sha] coincidentally ran into [An Zai] and others in the parking lot.
0:23:1|0:23:13|[An Zai] parked the car directly in front of [Xiao Xiaotian]'s car, making a warning gesture towards him, then took down [Xiao Xiaotian]'s license plate number before driving away.
0:23:13|0:23:20|In the room, [Xiao Xiaotian] carefully examines the jade pendant brought by [Miao Zi], his face solemn, then orders to close the door and leave.
0:24:9|0:24:12|[Xiao Xiaotian] tells Xianxian about his art of speaking.
0:24:12|0:24:18|[Miao Zi] pressed the elevator button, feeling extremely agitated, and kicked a nearby flower vase to vent his frustration.
0:24:20|0:24:24|Miao Zi, upon hearing the voice of the Alliance Leader, quickly found a place to hide.
0:24:44|0:24:54|While [Alliance Leader] and [Hu Zi] were waiting for the elevator, [Miao Zi] hid in the shadows watching them, his mind calculating who knows what.
0:24:54|0:25:6|After seeing the two enter the elevator, [Miao Zi] rushed out and quickly returned to [Xiao Xiaotian]'s residence, throwing a piece of jade skin directly onto the table.
0:25:9|0:25:26|[Xiao Xiaotian] was attracted by the treasure map on the table. He never expected that [Miao Zi] would be so ignorant, mistaking the treasure map for a piece of torn paper used to wrap jade.
0:25:26|0:25:36|[Xiao Xiaotian], who successfully obtained the treasure map, happily celebrated by the pool with Xianxian, unable to hide the excitement in his heart.
0:25:36|0:25:42|Continuing to play with the jade pendant in hand, Sha Sha studies its origins and history.
0:25:42|0:25:48|However, it is quite obvious that what really interests [Xiao Xiaotian] is the treasure map.
0:26:14|0:26:17|The treasure map hides a shocking secret behind it.
0:26:36|0:26:54|The [Alliance Leader] in the room is waiting for [Hu Zi] to bring in new recruits, but it turns out to be [Donggua] who enters the room.
0:26:54|0:27:2|[Hu Zi] warmly introduces [Donggua] to the [Alliance Leader], then picks up two chicken legs from the table and hands the smaller one to [Donggua].
0:27:12|0:27:14|[Hu Zi] kicked [Donggua].
0:27:16|0:27:19|[Donggua] looked at the two in confusion.
0:27:22|0:27:24|[Hu Zi] is furious.
0:27:56|0:27:59|The Alliance Leader was amused by Donggua and burst into laughter.
0:28:26|0:28:31|Upon hearing this, Xiao Qian immediately went out to get money for [Miao Zi].
0:28:31|0:28:43|Next second, [Alliance Leader] was kidnapped.
0:28:43|0:28:51|[Miao Zi] tried to escape by jumping out of the window, but was caught by [Alliance Leader] and [Hu Zi] by the arm.
0:28:51|0:28:52|Both sides are deadlocked.
0:29:13|0:29:16|Just as it seemed too late, a familiar sound of a car engine, [Ba Ge] arrived.
0:29:23|0:29:24|The crowd panicked.
0:29:33|0:29:37|The hiding places for everyone are inside the curtains and under the sofa.
0:29:37|0:29:45|Outside the window, [Miao Zi] was still hanging in mid-air, no one paid attention to it anymore. [Alliance Leader] quickly pulled down the curtains.
0:29:45|0:29:55|[Donggua] found a strange object under the coffee table, without bothering to investigate, hurriedly hid underneath and even remembered to bring the knife in with him.
0:29:55|0:30:5|[Hu Zi] opened the wardrobe and hid inside. Just as he concealed himself, the wardrobe door was opened by the [Alliance Leader]. It seems that the [Alliance Leader] also chose this hiding spot.
0:30:5|0:30:14|[Alliance Leader] set up a posture, gave a signal with his eyes, [Hu Zi] obediently gave up his position, and even remembered to close the wardrobe door for [Alliance Leader].
0:30:14|0:30:20|[Alliance Leader] sat down, and [Xiao Qian] quickly pushed the bag under the bed.
0:30:27|0:30:28|[Zhang Renfa] approaches [Xiao Qian].
0:30:47|0:30:50|[Zhang Renfa] walked to the window and was about to pull open the curtains.
0:30:50|0:30:56|A phone call arrives, can it save [Xiao Qian] from the current crisis.
0:31:31|0:31:33|[Xiao Qian] turned around with a guilty conscience and said.
0:31:33|0:31:36|[Zheng Renfa] dare not look directly at him.
0:31:36|0:31:40|But the more he did so, the heavier the doubts in [Zhang Renfa]'s heart.
0:31:40|0:31:44|Immediately, the curtain was pulled open and looked outside.
0:31:44|0:31:49|[Sha Sha] saw the situation and became restless, feeling the tension rising to its peak in her heart.
0:32:37|0:32:40|[Zhang Renfa]'s doubts in his heart were not dispelled.
0:32:55|0:33:9|[Sha Sha] pretended to prove herself, only to see [Donggua] unexpectedly.
0:33:9|0:33:15|Seeing that they had narrowly escaped, [Sha Sha] hurriedly went downstairs to see [Zhang Renfa] off.
0:33:15|0:33:19|Hu Zi in the wardrobe quickly opened the door and walked out.
0:33:19|0:33:22|The cramped space made his body extremely twisted and uncomfortable.
0:33:26|0:33:33|After coming out, Sha Sha politely knocked on the wardrobe door where the Alliance Leader was located, reminding the Alliance Leader to move the song.
0:33:33|0:33:42|Even though the [Alliance Leader] was nervous inside, he still maintained his composure and refused to lose face in front of [Hu Zi] as the big brother.
0:33:42|0:33:47|[Donggua] immediately climbed down from the coffee table, still holding a small whip, and curiously gave it a flick.
0:33:49|0:33:55|Then he tucked the whip into his pants.
0:33:55|0:34:1|[Hu Zi] roughly pulled [Miao Zi] up.
0:34:23|0:34:25|[Hu Zi] is furious.
0:34:37|0:34:42|[Alliance Leader] at this moment was suppressing his anger, only wanting to know the whereabouts of the treasure map.
0:34:55|0:35:1|In this crisis situation, [Miao Zi] had to quickly express that he was not lying.
0:35:1|0:35:3|The Alliance Leader kicked her to the ground.
0:35:23|0:35:29|[Donggua] holds the small whip he found, intending to use it to tie up [Miao Zi].
0:35:29|0:35:31|[Hu Zi] looked on with a look of curiosity.
0:35:34|0:35:40|[Hu Zi] tied up [Miao Zi], and with a command from the [Alliance Leader], kicked [Miao Zi] out.
0:35:44|0:35:46|[Donggua]'s question made [Xiao Qian] blush with shyness.
0:35:48|0:35:52|At the entrance of the hotel, [An Zi] forcefully pulled out the arm that [Sha Sha] was holding.
0:35:56|0:35:59|[Sha Sha] tenderly applies medicine to [An Zai].
0:35:59|0:36:4|[An Zai] noticed that [Donggua] was not in the room.
0:36:11|0:36:15|Sha Sha couldn't see Donggua's An Zi, and started to feel suspicious in her heart.
0:36:15|0:36:16|[Sha Sha] noticed the note on the table.
0:36:51|0:37:2|The phone in the movie kept ringing with no one answering, [An Zai]'s heart hanging in the air.
0:37:2|0:37:3|[Donggua] tried to make a call, but no one answered.
0:37:11|0:37:22|In the dark of night, [Xiao Xiaotian] and [Sha Sha] sensed that something was amiss in the cave and decided to explore it carefully.
0:37:22|0:37:28|The [Alliance Leader] in the cave was playing with a lighter boredly, waiting for his men to work.
0:37:28|0:37:32|Suddenly, the sound of footsteps outside made [Alliance Leader] panic.
0:37:34|0:37:36|Lian Mang called [Hu Zi] over.
0:37:41|0:37:45|[Hu Zi] and Lian Mang climbed out of the cave to check the situation.
0:37:45|0:37:51|The Alliance Leader adjusts the wreath, pretending to be in mourning.
0:37:51|0:37:56|Miao Zi followed closely behind, also crawling out of the hole.
0:37:56|0:37:59|The three of them immediately panicked.
0:37:59|0:38:3|[Donggua] had just stuck his head out of the hole when he was kicked back in by [Miao Zi].
0:38:4|0:38:13|Soon after, the three of them covered the hole with a sheet of iron and also used straw as a cover.
0:38:13|0:38:16|With the sound of knocking on the door, [Yang Shanshui] walked into the room.
0:38:56|0:38:59|This younger brother actually looks even older than his older brother.
0:39:19|0:39:23|Yang Shangshui was about to leave when his attention was caught by the bell on [Miao Zi]'s neck.
0:39:23|0:39:23|[Miao Zi] shyly lowered her head.
0:40:9|0:40:12|[Donggua] made two gestures, causing [Alliance Leader] to doubt himself.
0:40:15|0:40:18|Hu Zi explains on the side.
0:40:26|0:40:28|The Alliance Leader throws a clod at Donggua.
0:40:53|0:40:59|This kid, as the festive music plays, the Yang family wedding enters the countdown.
0:40:59|0:41:2|The winners arrived as scheduled, coming to witness the happiness of the couple.
0:41:24|0:41:30|Various luxury cars arrived, all showcasing Brother Fa's wealth and love for his daughter.
0:41:30|0:41:36|Outside the cave, the [Alliance Leader] and his companions were constantly keeping an eye on the situation at the wedding scene.
0:41:36|0:41:47|Beside the main car, the groom gently leads the bride out of the car and back to their home, where a scene of joy is everywhere.
0:41:47|0:41:50|Guests also took this opportunity to meet friends and have a good chat.
0:42:28|0:42:36|[Donggua] entered the cave first, followed closely by [Miao Zi].
0:42:36|0:42:45|Both of them entered the cave, with the [Alliance Leader] reminding [Hu Zi].
0:42:45|0:42:49|Then they also entered the cave.
0:42:51|0:42:56|The cave was dark, with no lights, they could only rely on flashlights for illumination.
0:42:56|0:42:59|The dim flashlight made the cave even more eerie.
0:42:59|0:43:5|[Donggua] found it amusing, laughing incessantly, completely unaware of the lurking danger in the cave.
0:43:5|0:43:10|[Alliance Leader] led [Donggua] to search for direction in the tomb, and they saw the kerosene lamp lit by Xiao Xiaotian.
0:43:10|0:43:15|Miao Zi quickly stepped forward and lit the kerosene lamp.
0:43:17|0:43:26|Something magical happened, all the kerosene lamps in the cave lit up, once again revealing the mystery within the tomb.
0:43:29|0:43:31|[Donggua] exclaimed excitedly.
0:43:32|0:43:36|[Alliance Leader] carefully observed the tomb, hoping to make a new discovery.
0:43:36|0:43:45|Outside the tomb, [An Zai] and [Sha Sha] climbed over the wall in the moonlight, advancing towards the groom's house, preparing to steal. [An Zai] lowered his steps, not daring to make a sound.
0:43:47|0:43:52|[Qingqing] walked up the steps, opened the door, and gestured for [Sha Sha] to enter.
0:43:52|0:43:55|[Sha Sha] quickly imitated [An Zai]'s actions.
0:43:55|0:44:0|The three [Alliance Leader] in the tomb are still searching aimlessly.
0:44:0|0:44:5|The [Alliance Leader] appeared as if experienced, with a carefree attitude.
0:44:5|0:44:10|[An Zai] walked to the bedroom door, this is the room where the betrothal gifts are stored, he seemed to see money beckoning to him.
0:44:14|0:44:19|The groom in the room was singing loudly, completely unaware of the impending danger.
0:44:19|0:44:25|[An Zai] cautiously pushed open the bedroom door, walked quietly to the cabinet where the betrothal gifts were placed, ready to take action.
0:44:25|0:44:36|At this moment, [Sha Sha] unexpectedly came to the table and picked up the bride's skincare products. Indeed, loving beauty is a woman's nature.
0:44:36|0:44:41|[An Zai], as a seasoned thief, carefully approached the bed to see if the newcomer was already fast asleep.
0:44:43|0:44:49|With all the surrounding dangers resolved, they were finally ready to proceed with the theft.
0:44:49|0:44:57|Next to the table, [Sha Sha] picked up the skincare products and carefully examined them. If it weren't for the tense situation, she would have been ready to do some skincare on the spot.
0:45:3|0:45:13|The Alliance Leader signaled for Sha Sha to come over and help. Sha Sha reluctantly put down the skincare products in her hand, walked to An Zi's side, and saw a stack of red envelopes, her face full of joy.
0:45:13|0:45:22|The two of them started to prepare the betrothal gifts, looking nervous, restraining their excitement, afraid of missing a single red envelope.
0:45:22|0:45:30|[An Zai]'s movements became more cautious, at this moment, what was in the bag seemed to be not just a simple betrothal gift, but their beautiful future.
0:45:33|0:45:38|After looting the money, the two quickly fled the scene.
0:45:38|0:45:43|When climbing over the wall, she still tightly held onto her backpack.
0:45:48|0:45:53|In the tomb, [Alliance Leader] and the other two gradually found themselves in a predicament.
0:45:53|0:45:57|They were wandering around in the maze-like tomb.
0:45:57|0:45:59|With no clue, the atmosphere gradually became tense.
0:46:2|0:46:12|They turned another corner, what kind of unknown awaits them at the corner?
0:46:12|0:46:21|Gradually, they began to notice something was amiss as the surroundings slowly became familiar.
0:46:21|0:46:29|They arrived at a place they had been to before, and the familiar scene immediately made the three of them panic.
0:46:29|0:46:31|The [Alliance Leader] also lost his composure at the beginning.
0:46:37|0:46:41|A look of panic appeared on the face.
0:46:41|0:46:50|Three of them quickened their pace, searching anxiously in the tomb, like ants on a hot pan.
0:46:50|0:46:59|[Alliance Leader] realized the urgency of the situation and decided that the three of them should split up to save time in searching.
0:47:21|0:47:27|[Miao Zi] didn't want to be alone, but had to obey.
0:47:27|0:47:34|Outside the cave, [Xiao Xiaotian] seized the opportunity and led Xian Xian into the cave, where they tied up [Hu Zi].
0:47:36|0:47:43|They then entered the cave, where the [Alliance Leader], Mu Xue, and the others were weakly leaning against the wall.
0:47:43|0:47:47|At this moment, an inescapable fear enveloped them.
0:47:47|0:47:57|Suddenly, the [Alliance Leader] had a sudden inspiration. He took out his phone and carefully examined the treasure map, hoping to make a new discovery.
0:47:57|0:48:3|After a brief search, the [Alliance Leader] actually made a new discovery, looking at the two people beside him with surprise.
0:48:8|0:48:11|The words of the [Alliance Leader] seemed to have reinvigorated the three of them with strength.
0:48:11|0:48:16|They followed a rope down and arrived at an open area.
0:48:16|0:48:19|[Alliance Leader] signaled for [Miao Zi] to go first.
0:48:21|0:48:25|Even if [Miao Zi] is unwilling, he has to do as he is told.
0:48:26|0:48:30|He walked carefully in front, with [Donggua] following closely behind him.
0:48:32|0:48:38|Suddenly, [Miao Zi] stepped on a trap and almost fell in.
0:48:38|0:48:46|Fortunately, [Alliance Leader] acted quickly and pulled him up, the three of them looked at the scene in the trap and exchanged glances.
0:48:46|0:48:52|[Alliance Leader] hurriedly opened the phone again to look at the treasure map, and said confidently.
0:48:52|0:49:9|[Alliance Leader] once again signaled for [Miao Zi] to take the lead. This time, [Miao Zi] cautiously moved forward along the wall, with [Donggua] following closely behind, trembling in fear of stepping into a trap. [Alliance Leader] at this moment was also unable to remain calm within the walls, following closely behind [Donggua].
0:49:9|0:49:14|The three of them were too busy to notice [Xiao Xiaotian] and Xianxian behind them.
0:49:17|0:49:26|[Xiao Xiaotian] and [Alliance Leader] were obviously in a much better situation than the three of them, well-prepared and experienced.
0:49:26|0:49:41|[Xiao Xiaotian] opened the treasure map, with victory in hand, showing a confident look as if the world belonged to him, then he pointed out the correct direction.
0:49:41|0:49:42|Look back at the Nine Bends Yellow River Formation.
0:49:46|0:49:53|[Alliance Leader] The three of them arrived at a narrow space, with a stone door blocking their way.
0:49:53|0:49:58|[Alliance Leader] looked around and bluntly stated that there were hidden mysteries in this place.
0:50:10|0:50:15|They then decided to use the most stupid method, planning to push open the stone door with human force.
0:50:15|0:50:17|Obviously, this method is not feasible.
0:50:17|0:50:23|[Alliance Leader] decided to change tactics and called for the three people pushing the door to stop.
0:50:29|0:50:35|On the wall, a unique stone statue caught the attention of [Alliance Leader].
0:50:43|0:50:45|[Alliance Leader] gave a meaningful glance.
0:50:46|0:50:50|[Miao Zi] stepped forward and tried to twist the stone statue.
0:50:50|0:50:53|Sure enough, there is a hidden mechanism, and the stone statue begins to rotate.
0:50:53|0:51:0|With a loud rumble, the stone door slowly opened on its own.
0:51:0|0:51:2|The three of them decided to see what was going on.
0:51:6|0:51:18|Entering the stone gate, what greeted their eyes was a huge room with a strange layout. The three of them slowly searched for secrets with flashlights in the empty room.
0:51:18|0:51:23|The room was filled with only the noisy sound of footsteps, revealing a sinister atmosphere.
0:51:23|0:51:27|Soon, the three of them cast their gaze on a certain spot.
0:51:27|0:51:31|On the other side, [Xiao Xiaotian] and Xianxian also noticed the corner entering the room.
0:51:33|0:51:37|A magical scene occurs again in the room.
0:51:37|0:51:41|The lights all come on in an instant.
0:51:41|0:51:45|The central stone pillar stands out conspicuously.
0:51:45|0:51:52|[Alliance Leader], [Donggua], and [Hu Zi] stood closely around the stone pillar, their faces showing a look of fascination.
0:51:52|0:51:58|At this moment, in the eyes of the [Alliance Leader], there was only the Yang Family Sword in the stone pillar.
0:51:58|0:51:59|The smile of victory blossomed on his face.
0:52:1|0:52:6|The Alliance Leader seemed to see a million people waving at him.
0:52:30|0:52:33|[Alliance Leader] shouted at [Miao Zi].
0:52:33|0:52:37|[Miao Zi] took out the Yang Family Sword and handed it over to [Alliance Leader] politely.
0:52:37|0:52:42|[Alliance Leader] took over the Yang Family Sword, holding it tightly in his hand, with a big smile on his face.
0:52:50|0:52:55|He walked out of the room with the Yang Family Sword in hand, a smile on his face, unaware that danger was about to come.
0:52:55|0:53:2|[Xiao Xiaotian] had been waiting outside for a long time when the [Alliance Leader] stepped on the trap he had set up.
0:53:2|0:53:7|Taking advantage of the chaos, [Xiao Xiaotian] snatched the sword and ran off, leaving only the wailing Alliance Leader and two others behind.
0:53:9|0:53:20|[Xiao Xiaotian] hurriedly took Xianxian away from the sight of the [Alliance Leader], observing the surroundings in a safe area, feeling excited in his heart.
0:53:20|0:53:28|On the way out of Yangjia City, [Sha Sha] saw a familiar car, and upon closer inspection, it turned out to be [Xiao Xiaotian]'s car.
0:53:28|0:53:34|In the saying that no debt goes unpaid, the time has not come yet. In this perfect opportunity, how could [Alliance Leader] let it slip by.
0:53:36|0:53:45|Parking the car by the roadside, waiting for [Xiao Xiaotian] to arrive, filled with hatred from the previous encounter at Yixi Mall.
0:53:45|0:53:56|[Xiao Xiaotian] and the other person ran out of the tomb, quickly arrived at the car, opened the trunk, put the backpack in, and prepared to drive away.
0:53:56|0:54:2|Sitting in the driver's seat, [Xiao Xiaotian] still couldn't hide his excitement, constantly studying the items borrowed from the Yang family.
0:54:12|0:54:18|[Xiao Xiaotian] eagerly took the sword, looking excited.
0:54:18|0:54:33|[Xiao Xiaotian] made this impolite request.
0:54:33|0:54:48|A dagger lay across Xiao Xiaotian's face, as An Zai pressed Xiao Xiaotian and the other against the car door.
0:54:48|0:54:59|[Sha Sha] immediately took out Xiao Xiaotian's backpack and started searching through it. As she was searching, Alliance Leader suddenly had a big change in expression, took out an heirloom from the bag, and found out it was actually a handgun.
0:54:59|0:55:5|[An Zai] was full of disbelief on his face, took out his gun and carefully inspected it, aiming the gun at [Xiao Xiaotian].
0:55:11|0:55:29|[An Zai] put the gun behind him for emergencies, and then continued to search through the bag, turning it upside down and inside out.
0:55:29|0:55:33|He actually brought out the Yang Family Sword, obviously he doesn't know the secret of the sword.
0:55:41|0:55:45|[An Zai] and [Sha Sha] initiated the evacuation, with [Xiao Xiaotian] leading them away.
0:55:51|0:55:55|Sha Sha took a hairpin from her head, trying to unlock the handcuffs.
0:55:55|0:55:59|With a few moves, the handcuffs were really unlocked.
0:55:59|0:56:4|Then she found a card in the back seat, with the location where [An Zai] lived written on it.
0:56:4|0:56:11|[Xiao Xiaotian] decides to avenge every wrong.
0:56:11|0:56:18|[Alliance Leader], along with a few others, sneaked away from the cave under the moonlight, but after a lot of effort, they ended up empty-handed.
0:56:18|0:56:20|[An Zai] and [Sha Sha] returned to the hotel and found that the room key was missing.
0:56:50|0:57:3|[An Zai] at this moment, there are more important matters to attend to, so he couldn't be bothered to argue with the shopkeeper. He quickly persuaded [Sha Sha] to leave, and [Sha Sha], considering the betrothal gift, did not waste any more time with the shopkeeper.
0:57:13|0:57:22|[An Zi] pulled the curtains closed, [Sha Sha] opened her backpack, [An Zi] kept moving without stopping, only to see her take out the Yang Family Sword from the bag and casually throw it on the bed.
0:57:22|0:57:30|The bed was piled with various items, and [Sha Sha] couldn't wait to pour out all the red envelopes, the cash on the bed stimulating her eyes.
0:57:30|0:57:40|Here, Sha Sha is still playing with the Yang Family Sword, she never understands the secret of this sword, and doesn't understand why Xiao Xiaotian always carries a broken sword with him.
0:57:40|0:57:43|[Sha Sha] looked at the pile of money and couldn't help but laugh.
0:57:47|0:57:51|The action of counting money in hand did not stop at all.
0:57:59|0:58:3|[An Zai] had already planned the use of money in his heart.
0:59:3|0:59:8|Hu Zi gave Miao Zi a slap in the face, and Miao Zi sprayed the wine directly at the Alliance Leader.
0:59:8|0:59:13|The Alliance Leader couldn't hide his anger and threw the baseball bat.
0:59:17|0:59:24|[Donggua] shakes his candy box on the side and pours out a piece of candy.
0:59:24|0:59:29|Eating candy to gather courage, [Sha Sha] nervously approached the [Alliance Leader] and asked.
0:59:51|0:59:55|The Alliance Leader grabs Donggua's ear.
1:0:3|1:0:14|[Donggua] has never been so angry before, standing still and spitting out a mouthful of saliva to endure the anger, silently walking to the side.
1:0:17|1:0:29|[An Zai] walked to the bridge with the snacks he just bought, stood still, and was about to call [Donggua] again.
1:0:58|1:1:1|[Donggua] and [An Zai]'s conversation was overheard by [Alliance Leader].
1:1:12|1:1:16|[Donggua] looked at [Alliance Leader] in a panic.
1:1:45|1:1:47|[Donggua] tried to escape but was caught and brought back.
1:1:47|1:1:49|[Yaozi] watched from the side, witnessing the miserable state of [Donggua].
1:2:18|1:2:20|[Huayin] has just fallen, and [Miao Zi] has also been tied up.
1:2:20|1:2:22|Miao Zi and Donggua are both tied to the wall.
1:2:22|1:2:25|One head down, one head up.
1:2:48|1:2:58|In the inn, [Sha Sha] was immersed in the happiness of money, unaware of what was about to happen.
1:2:58|1:3:5|Outside the door, a man holding a card walks slowly with melodious music, showing off his elegance.
1:3:5|1:3:12|With the sound of knocking on the door, [Sha Sha] quickly packed up the money and went to open the door.
1:3:12|1:3:15|Opening the door, Sha Sha sees a charming puppet man.
1:3:20|1:3:25|The man's words were unexpectedly frivolous.
1:4:5|1:4:9|At the critical moment, [An Zai] arrives in time to rescue [Sha Sha].
1:5:7|1:5:12|[An Zai] insisted on going to Room 611 to check the situation, and before going upstairs, he didn't forget the backpack on the bed.
1:5:12|1:5:13|After much consideration, [Donggua] decided to carry the package on his back.
1:5:35|1:5:42|[Xiao Xiaotian] and [Sha Sha] arrived outside the inn, with [Xiao Xiaotian] almost falling down after firing a shot.
1:5:42|1:5:49|At the door of room 119, the two of them pressed their ears against the door, trying to listen to the movement inside.
1:5:49|1:5:55|[Xiao Xiaotian] carefully closed the door and then covered the peephole.
1:5:55|1:5:58|Finding no one inside the house, they took out the room key lost by [An Zai].
1:6:0|1:6:8|Sha Sha rolled into the room as the door opened, leaving Xiao Xiaotian to helplessly shout.
1:6:11|1:6:16|The [Alliance Leader] is outside the inn, tidying up his appearance and preparing for a fight.
1:6:16|1:6:19|[Hu Zi] is strong, imitating the appearance of [Alliance Leader].
1:6:19|1:6:24|[Xiao Xiaotian] flipped his palm in the room, still without any gain, feeling a bit anxious in his heart.
1:6:32|1:6:34|Take down the photo on the wall first.
1:6:34|1:6:41|[Alliance Leader] The two of them outside the room heard the noise inside, then took out their gear and prepared to enter combat mode.
1:6:41|1:6:46|[Xiao Xiaotian] turned around and found himself in a crisis.
1:6:46|1:6:51|Hu Zi cooperatively lifted his leg, allowing Alliance Leader to light the lighter on his leg.
1:6:51|1:6:52|Four people in the room were at a stalemate.
1:6:56|1:7:5|It is obvious that [Xiao Xiaotian] is at a disadvantage, standing still in a daze.
1:7:13|1:7:20|[An Zai] and [Sha Sha] came out of room 611, laughing and joking as they returned to the room, only to see [Xiao Xiaotian] being kicked out from inside.
1:7:20|1:7:27|The two were amazed and saw [Xiao Xiaotian] being captured into the room again.
1:7:27|1:7:34|An Zai saw the situation and hurriedly pulled Sha Sha to escape.
1:7:34|1:7:38|In the room, [Xiao Xiaotian] and Xianxian are tied up.
1:7:38|1:7:40|[Xiao Xiaotian] is puzzled and confused.
1:7:58|1:8:4|[Alliance Leader] struck the table with a single blow, inadvertently showcasing his strong martial arts skills.
1:8:4|1:8:9|Hu Zi, seeing the situation, quickly withdrew his hand in fright.
1:8:24|1:8:29|[Hu Zi] took out his phone, opened a photo, and questioned.
1:8:31|1:8:35|[Xiao Xiaotian] hurriedly approached the two of them.
1:8:58|1:9:3|[Alliance Leader] decided to use [Donggua] to threaten [An Zai] to show up.
1:9:3|1:9:6|Xiao Xiaotian smiled bitterly, hoping that the [Alliance Leader] would let the two of them go.
1:9:8|1:9:19|[An Zai] and [Sha Sha] fled, realizing something was wrong, they kept calling [Donggua], but no one answered.
1:9:30|1:9:36|[An Zai] noticed the unusualness of the sword, took it out from the bag, and examined it carefully, filled with doubts in his heart.
1:9:43|1:9:46|In the police station, the police received a report.
1:9:51|1:9:57|Upon receiving the report, the police immediately drove to the scene of the incident to search for clues.
1:9:57|1:10:12|Upon arriving at the Yang family, they immediately began their investigation, gathering evidence in the room that had been robbed. They were preparing to take the evidence back to the police station for further analysis.
1:10:14|1:10:18|Inside the house, [Zhang Renfa] was already furious, for him,
1:10:28|1:10:32|Several people sat down to start recording.
1:10:46|1:10:49|Suddenly, the groom thought of something.
1:10:56|1:10:58|The groom sensed that something was wrong.
1:11:0|1:11:8|Leading the group to the cave, what they saw in front of their eyes was a huge underground cavern.
1:11:21|1:11:24|Several people gathered around the cave entrance.
1:12:3|1:12:26|[Alliance Leader] Hu Zi used [Donggua] and [Miao Zi] as his targets for venting, continuously hitting them with a baseball bat and smashing medicine bottles on them.
1:12:26|1:12:28|Brother Fa called the Alliance Leader.
1:13:1|1:13:4|[Zhang Ren] made a phone call to the [Blackie] boss.
1:13:4|1:13:9|[Zhang Renfa] angrily hung up the phone, leaving only the puzzled Alliance Leader [Heizi].
1:13:9|1:13:14|[Heizi] the boss is getting angrier and angrier.
1:13:14|1:13:21|In the warehouse, [Alliance Leader] was practicing with the ball when a call from the boss [Hu Zi] came in.
1:13:21|1:13:27|The Alliance Leader's face darkened immediately, exchanged a glance with Hu Zi, and finally answered the phone.
1:13:29|1:13:33|[Alliance Leader] made a sudden decision to perform a complex stacking move.
1:14:5|1:14:9|After finishing the explanation, [Heizi] arrogantly hung up the phone.
1:14:9|1:14:13|Xiao Xiaotian looked at the [Alliance Leader] in confusion.
1:14:33|1:14:36|[Hu Zi] gritted his teeth and cursed when mentioning [Heizi].
1:14:36|1:14:37|[Hu Zi] is furious.
1:14:57|1:15:12|Picking up a stick, [Xiao Xiaotian] was beaten and screamed miserably, running and screaming, the wailing echoing throughout the warehouse.
1:15:12|1:15:16|After defeating Xiao Xiaotian, the Alliance Leader and Sha Sha arrived in front of Miao Zi and Donggua.
1:15:32|1:15:38|The Alliance Leader was unexpectedly kind, helping Donggua untie the ropes.
1:15:38|1:15:44|[Donggua] didn't care about his bound feet and kept jumping forward.
1:15:44|1:15:49|Unexpectedly, [Hu Zi] kicked [Donggua] to the ground, causing him to crawl forward in fear with both feet.
1:16:18|1:16:24|The Alliance Leader's threat made Donggua almost cry, his voice trembling.
1:16:24|1:16:28|Hastily dialed Xiao Xiaotian's phone number.
1:16:28|1:16:30|[An Zai] saw that it was [Donggua] and quickly asked.
1:16:49|1:16:52|The Alliance Leader snatched the phone away.
1:17:16|1:17:20|The plane slowly landed, and [Hu Zi] arrived at the God's Tomb.
1:17:20|1:17:26|The first thing he did when he arrived was not to go to the Yang family to get the sword, but to take his little brothers out to play.
1:17:26|1:17:34|[Heizi] drove on the beach with four henchmen following closely behind, showing no concern for the wind.
1:17:37|1:17:47|[An Zai] and [Sha Sha] made up their minds to rescue [Donggua].
1:17:47|1:17:56|The two arrived at the warehouse as planned, intending to check the situation inside. They crouched under the window and peeked inside the room.
1:17:56|1:18:2|[An Zai] cautiously crouched by the window, afraid of being discovered by the people inside the house.
1:18:2|1:18:7|In his sight were several familiar faces tied up and the two people drinking and eating meat, the [Alliance Leader].
1:18:9|1:18:17|[Donggua] was tied up with his arms behind his back, crouching in the corner, with [Miao Zi] hanging upside down next to him.
1:18:17|1:18:21|[An Zai] discusses the rescue plan with [Sha Sha].
1:18:21|1:18:29|At this moment, the two of them were at a loss and didn't know what to do.
1:18:39|1:18:44|[An Zai] immediately decided to wait for the right moment and remain inactive.
1:18:44|1:18:51|Suddenly, a noise came from a distance.
1:18:51|1:18:56|As they waited, a car drove up.
1:18:56|1:19:0|The car arrived just in time to stop behind [Sha Sha], and [Sha Sha] and the two immediately found themselves in danger.
1:19:2|1:19:8|Fortunately, [Hu Zi] was solely focused on the Yang Family Sword and did not notice the unusual vehicle.
1:19:8|1:19:14|[Heizi] and his group walked into the warehouse aggressively, not forgetting to inform the Alliance Leader.
1:19:14|1:19:19|But the Yang Family Sword has been lost, how will the [Alliance Leader] respond?
1:19:30|1:19:35|The henchman opened the safe, revealing a pile of [cucumbers].
1:19:35|1:19:39|[Hu Zi] picked up a stick from the middle and started eating.
1:19:39|1:19:45|It can be seen that [Sha Sha] has a special affection for [Donggua].
1:19:45|1:19:58|[Heizi] eats a cucumber while leading his gang towards the warehouse. He kicks open the warehouse door and then advances towards [Alliance Leader] and others step by step, creating a sense of oppression.
1:20:12|1:20:20|[Hu Zi] pulled Xianxian, who was sitting on the chair, and asked him to give up his seat to [Heizi].
1:20:20|1:20:27|[Alliance Leader] pointed casually, not even putting down the foot resting on the table, signaling for [Hu Zi] to take a seat.
1:20:33|1:20:37|[Hu Zi] immediately felt that his dignity was being scorned.
1:21:8|1:21:14|A gesture, and his men headed towards [Xiao Xiaotian].
1:21:14|1:21:18|His subordinates brought [Xiao Xiaotian] directly to [Heizi] and started to reprimand him.
1:21:26|1:21:45|On one side, [Xiao Xiaotian] is being beaten to near death, while on the other side, [Donggua] and [Miao Zi], who are hanging, seem unaffected, even sharing snacks.
1:21:45|1:21:58|[An Zai] leaned against the wall, analyzing the situation inside the warehouse. A child in front of him sparked a brilliant idea in his mind.
1:21:58|1:22:1|The child ran into the warehouse as instructed by [An Zai].
1:22:3|1:22:12|[Sha Sha] handed a note to [Hu Zi].
1:22:12|1:22:19|[Heizi] finished reading the note, feeling his authority being challenged. He threw the cucumber in his hand and pulled out a gun, pointing it at [Alliance Leader].
1:22:40|1:22:46|[Alliance Leader] was tied up by [Hu Zi]'s men before figuring out what had happened.
1:22:50|1:22:54|At this point, the [Alliance Leader] still wants to maintain his final dignity.
1:22:54|1:22:58|The next second, still with [Donggua] and others, they were tied up in the corner of the wall.
1:22:58|1:23:1|The scene is somewhat poignant and funny.
1:23:1|1:23:5|[Heizi] tied up the people in the warehouse and then left with his men.
1:23:5|1:23:11|[An Zai] and [Sha Sha] were afraid of being discovered by [Hei Zi], so they started playing a game of hide and seek by the car.
1:23:11|1:23:17|They detoured in front of the car, risking danger as they waited for [Heizi] and his group to get on the car and leave.
1:23:17|1:23:20|[Sha Sha] and [Alliance Leader] were about to enter the warehouse to rescue [Donggua].
1:23:26|1:23:32|Not far away, another car drove up, scaring them into hastily continuing to hide and observe the situation in front of the car.
1:23:32|1:23:38|Getting out of the car are [Zhang Renfa] and Xiao Qian. It seems that [Zhang Renfa] is also eager to get the Yang Family Sword.
1:23:38|1:23:50|[An Zai] and [Sha Sha] circled around to the back of the car, watching as [Zhang Renfa] and his group entered the warehouse. They were calculating their next move, keeping a close eye on [Zhang Renfa] from behind the car.
1:23:50|1:23:55|[Zhang Renfa] was shocked by the scene inside the warehouse as soon as he walked in.
1:23:59|1:24:6|Qianqian looked at [Miao Zi], who was hanging upside down on the wall, her body stiffening instantly, unsure of what to do.
1:24:15|1:24:19|[Zhang Renfa] is searching everywhere for [Xiao Xiaotian].
1:24:19|1:24:20|[Zhang Renfa] is seen picking up a baseball bat.
1:24:53|1:24:54|[Xiao Xiaotian] hurriedly explained.
1:25:16|1:25:25|[Zhang Renfa] hasn't made a move yet, just raising the baseball bat in his hand.
1:25:25|1:25:28|[Xiao Xiaotian] was so scared that he fainted.
1:25:28|1:25:32|[Zhang Renfa] walked with his men to the bound crowd.
1:25:43|1:25:52|Hu Zi noticed Miao Zi hanging there, while Sha Sha looked at Miao Zi with a sense of inner turmoil.
1:26:5|1:26:7|The Alliance Leader was filled with doubt as soon as he heard it.
1:26:7|1:26:11|As soon as it was mentioned as a secret, [Hu Zi] became interested.
1:26:37|1:26:46|[Hu Zi]'s words made [Zhang Renfa] turn to look at [Sha Sha], who was in a panic, with fear in her eyes.
1:26:55|1:26:59|[Sha Sha] lost her fake smile from earlier, her gaze now fierce.
1:27:24|1:27:28|[Sha Sha] could only do as [Zhang Renfa] said and crouched down.
1:27:52|1:27:54|Miao Zi quickly explained.
1:27:54|1:27:57|Xiao Qian was ruthlessly pushed away by [Zhang Renfa].
1:27:57|1:28:8|[Zhang Renfa] noticed the device on [Miao Zi]'s neck.
1:28:13|1:28:14|Xiao Qian's phone rang.
1:28:18|1:28:27|Xiao Qian was so scared that she didn't know what to do, [Zhang Renfa] snatched the phone away.
1:28:53|1:29:5|[Zhang Renfa] turned to look at Xiao Qian, obviously she was completely angered by Xiao Qian's actions.
1:29:36|1:29:40|Furiously, he ordered his men to tie up Xiao Qian as well.
1:29:47|1:29:51|[Zhang Renfa] at this moment didn't care about settling scores with Xiao Qian, only the Yang Family Sword was on his mind.
1:30:1|1:30:4|Michelle stayed behind to guard everyone, and then left.
1:30:4|1:30:7|The roaring engine, showing [Zhang Renfa]'s eagerness.
1:30:7|1:30:11|When Zhang Renfa walked away, Alliance Leader and Donggua came out from behind the car.
1:30:11|1:30:16|[An Zai] took out a fake gun from behind, intending to intimidate Michelle with it.
1:30:16|1:30:19|At this moment, this gun finally came in handy.
1:30:19|1:30:23|[Heizi] gradually realized that something was wrong while waiting.
1:30:38|1:30:42|Immediately arrange [Alliance Leader] to take two subordinates back to the warehouse.
1:30:43|1:30:46|Michelle raised her hands in fright.
1:30:46|1:30:49|[Donggua] quickly called for help.
1:30:55|1:30:58|[Donggua] saw [Sha Sha] and immediately acted cute, asking her to help him untie himself.
1:31:4|1:31:21|[An Zai] discovered that there was another person tied up on the chair. He lifted his head and found that it was actually [Xiao Xiaotian].
1:31:24|1:31:31|Seeing the current miserable state of [Xiao Xiaotian], feeling secretly pleased, leaving only [Xiao Xiaotian] frightened and at a loss.
1:31:31|1:31:36|Outside the door, [Sha Sha] is leading two henchmen, walking towards the warehouse.
1:31:36|1:31:39|[Sha Sha] is examining the sword, and upon hearing a noise outside the door, she shouts.
1:31:44|1:31:52|[An Zai] and [Donggua] saw the situation and quickly each picked up a baseball bat, hiding at the warehouse door, ready to ambush.
1:31:52|1:31:59|[Sha Sha] led two henchmen into the warehouse, and [Donggua] knocked out one of the henchmen with a single blow.
1:31:59|1:32:4|[An Zai] saw the situation and scared [Sha Sha] into screaming and running away.
1:32:4|1:32:10|[Heizi] couldn't reach [Sha Sha], so he angrily drove back to the warehouse. The people tied up in the corner found the situation somewhat comical.
1:32:25|1:32:26|Zhang Renfa was very helpless.
1:32:31|1:32:33|[An Zai] Unbelievable.
1:32:52|1:32:57|The sound of a car outside the warehouse once again made [Sha Sha] and the others even more nervous.
1:32:57|1:33:0|[Heizi] arrived, [An Zai] concentrated his mind and came up with a way to deal with it.
1:33:5|1:33:11|Have [Sha Sha] hide, stay away from danger, and prepare to ambush again with [Donggua] at the door.
1:33:11|1:33:15|[Heizi] opens the warehouse door, sensing that something is amiss, cautiously observing the entrance into the warehouse.
1:33:15|1:33:21|With a shout from [An Zai], [Heizi] was knocked unconscious by [An Zai] with a stick.
1:33:21|1:33:26|[Sha Sha] Some people looked at the increasing number of people tied up in the corner, feeling helpless and unsure of how to handle the situation.
1:33:34|1:33:35|[An Zai] noticed.
1:33:38|1:33:43|Outside the door, a familiar car drove up, it turned out to be [Zhang Renfa] coming back.
1:33:43|1:33:48|[Zhang Renfa] hurriedly got off the car and headed towards the warehouse.
1:33:48|1:33:55|[Sha Sha] saw this familiar scene and conscientiously assigned herself a task.
1:33:55|1:34:0|[Sha Sha] led [Donggua] to decide to use the old trick again, and they stood at the entrance of the warehouse.
1:34:5|1:34:13|Hu Zi was knocked unconscious with a stick by Alliance Leader as soon as he saluted Ming.
1:34:13|1:34:26|[Xiao Xiaotian] took out a dagger from inside his pants, ready to cut the rope and free himself.
1:34:26|1:34:34|Just as [Sha Sha], [Alliance Leader], and [Donggua] decided to give up tying up the sword and leave, the sound of a car was heard outside the warehouse again, and the police arrived.
1:34:35|1:34:42|Several police cars parked steadily at the entrance of the warehouse, then the police raised their guns and rushed into the warehouse.
1:34:49|1:34:55|[An Zai] and the others were still unaware of the urgency of the situation, but this time [Sha Sha] requested to join the operation together.
1:34:55|1:35:6|They didn't notice at all that [Xiao Xiaotian], who was originally tied to a chair, had already escaped through the window. It was only seen that [Xiao Xiaotian] turned his coat inside out, revealing a police uniform on the other side.
1:35:11|1:35:15|The police officer's question let [Xiao Xiaotian] know that he had been discovered.
1:35:20|1:35:28|The police raised their guns and surrounded the group of people in the corner, capturing them all in one fell swoop, and obeying the police's handling.
1:35:28|1:35:32|At this point, the theft of the Yang family sword finally comes to an end.
