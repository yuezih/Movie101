0:2:21|0:2:33|Mr. Qian also shouted, then used a calculator, and then wrote in a notebook, saying to [Li Guofu],
0:2:52|0:3:4|[Li Guofu] continued to ask, and Mr. Qian said helplessly,
0:3:21|0:3:30|After speaking, Li Guofu looked somewhat pleased as he glanced at the suona in his hand, and Mr. Qian continued,
0:3:41|0:3:47|Mr. Qian raised his hand to hit [Li Guofu] while counting money, but accidentally tripped and scattered money all over the floor.
0:4:20|0:4:29|At this moment, [Li Guofu] suddenly remembered that his son was outside and about to leave. Mr. Qian saw the police surrounding [Li Guofu] and tried to slip away, but he was still caught by the police.
0:4:43|0:4:50|At the same time, Li Guofu, who had just climbed over the outer wall, was also caught. Pinned to the ground, Li Guofu looked towards his accomplice not far away.
0:4:50|0:4:54|Li Guofu was pinned down by three police officers, screaming in pain.
0:4:55|0:5:27|The four people who were then controlled were handcuffed to the iron bars of the detention vehicle. [Li Guofu] stared at Boss Qian, then looked at his son and asked. Li Faqun shook his head, and after [Li Guofu] nodded, he kicked Boss Qian, who hit back. Boss Qian felt guilty and remained silent. [Li Guofu] angrily asked, and Boss Qian, with a helpless and annoyed expression, replied,
0:5:29|0:5:44|After lecturing Mr. Qian, [Li Guofu] shouted towards the police in front. Seeing no response from the police, he turned around to comfort his son, Li Faqun.
0:6:3|0:6:26|After letting out a sigh, [Li Guofu] felt uncomfortable in the back of his neck. He reached out and touched it, pulling out the broken sunglasses from the collar of his sweater. At this moment, [Ping Wa] saw blood flowing from the back of [Li Guofu]'s neck and shouted incoherently, "Dad, he's bleeding, he's bleeding, over there!" Mr. Qian looked guiltily at the blood in [Li Guofu]'s hand, then kicked towards Mr. Qian.
0:6:34|0:6:43|The assistant next to them also lowered his head. After arriving at the police station, the police understood the situation and pushed Boss Li and his assistant inside.
0:6:43|0:6:47|Indoors, the police officer apologized to [Li Guofu],
0:7:44|0:7:50|The police officer chuckled, then [Li Guofu] awkwardly said,
0:8:0|0:8:17|The police officers in the room awkwardly smiled after listening. [Li Guofu] widened his eyes and urgently asked, then the police officers did not refuse to send the father and son back home.
0:8:17|0:8:23|In the back seat of the police car, [Ping Wa] looked around cautiously, while [Li Guofu] excitedly stared ahead through the sunglasses on the passenger seat.
0:8:23|0:8:32|At this moment, the police spoke to [Li Guofu],
0:8:39|0:8:48|The police officer smiled and pointed at the sunglasses in front of the car, saying,
0:9:5|0:9:14|[Li Guofu] carefully looked through the sunglasses, then put them on and turned to ask his son in the back seat, [Ping Wa], who nodded in response.
0:9:14|0:9:42|[Li Guofu] turned around with joy and looked at the rearview mirror in front of the car. Then he adjusted the mirror towards himself and smiled brightly. Shortly after, a police car slowly passed through the alley in front of [Li Guofu]'s house. Wearing sunglasses, [Li Guofu] sat in the police car and confidently spoke to the neighbors on the roadside. The neighbors were stunned for a moment, and after showing off, he got into the car through the window.
0:9:44|0:9:51|Walking through the streets and alleys, we arrived at the courtyard where [Li Guofu] lived. The car lights slowly swept over the neighbors who were moving things outside the house.
0:9:52|0:9:55|After the police car came to a stop, the father and son got out of the car.
0:9:55|0:9:58|[Li Guofu] took off his sunglasses and bid farewell to the police officer.
0:10:4|0:10:13|Excited, [Li Guofu] raised his sunglasses and gestured thanks to the police. After saying goodbye to the police, [Li Guofu] put on his sunglasses again and walked towards the house. Seeing this, the neighbor next door shouted to [Li Guofu],
0:10:31|0:10:51|After saying that, he proudly returned to the room. [Ping Wa] picked up the boiled kettle from the stove and poured foot-washing water for the two of them, while [Li Guofu] lay on the bed holding the new sunglasses carefully examining them, from the lenses to the legs of the glasses, even every screw, he looked at them repeatedly, like a child getting a long-awaited toy.
0:10:51|0:11:11|[Ping Wa] poured the foot-washing water, watching his father playing with sunglasses on the bed, reminding him to wash his feet. Then [Li Guofu] also put on sunglasses and stretched his feet into the foot bath, saying to his son as he soaked his feet,
0:11:14|0:11:23|[Ping Wa] responded expressionlessly,
0:11:27|0:11:31|[Ping Wa] sat there unwillingly, not saying a word. Seeing [Ping Wa] remain silent, Li Guofu...
0:11:31|0:11:39|[Li Guofu] sat up from the bed, took off his sunglasses, and solemnly patted [Ping Wa]'s arm. Seeing this, his son reluctantly said,
0:11:40|0:11:48|[Li Guofu] said discontentedly, while [Ping Wa] tried hard to learn.
0:11:55|0:12:5|[Li Guofu] lay back on the bed disappointedly, while [Ping Wa] turned to look at him and then turned back expressionlessly to stare into space. The two of them remained silent and continued soaking their feet.
0:12:54|0:13:2|Ping Wa stood on the side, twisting a bottle and watching the two of them.
0:13:20|0:13:27|Later, Liu Guilan took out money from her bag and said to [Li Guofu],
0:13:41|0:13:48|Li Guofu watched as Liu Guilan walked away, feeling quite emotional. At that moment, the neighbor beside him said,
0:14:4|0:14:27|At night, [Li Guofu] rode a three-wheeled motorcycle with an engine, taking Ping Wa back with a smile. Suddenly, the engine stalled. [Li Guofu] tried to rev the throttle with no response. Seeing this, Ping Wa habitually got off the vehicle and pushed it while running. [Li Guofu] kept twisting the throttle on the vehicle, trying to reignite the engine.
0:14:27|0:14:42|At this moment, the driver on another road was on the phone when suddenly [Li Guofu] and Ping Wa appeared in front of the car. The driver, seeing Ping Wa still pushing, made a sharp turn and hit the roadside.
0:14:45|0:14:54|The driver quickly got out of the car and ran to the front to check. He found that the front bumper had been knocked off. He angrily walked towards the two, and [Li Guofu] quickly apologized when he saw this.
0:15:21|0:15:26|After the two of them pushed each other, [Li Guofu] picked up a stick from the car. The driver, seeing this, softened and said,
0:15:36|0:15:51|[Li Guofu] angrily finished speaking and then glared, the car owner sighed in resignation and said, then he grumbled as he walked towards the car, [Li Guofu] angrily watched the car owner walk away with a stick in hand before turning and leaving.
0:15:51|0:16:16|Ping Wa stood by, at a loss, while the car owner dialed the company's number on the roadside. As the car owner heard the engine start, he looked at the father and son, and after Ping Wa pushed the car for a while, the engine started running. Ping Wa jumped into the car, and the two of them left gracefully.
0:16:17|0:16:23|Watching the two of them leave, the car owner helplessly continued to listen to the insurance agent on the phone, while [Li Guofu] rode the tricycle quickly forward.
0:16:23|0:16:51|The scene shifts to the square, where [Li Guofu] changes into his dancing outfit. He sits on a bench, eating while chatting with [Liu Guilan]. He exclaims the deliciousness of the food while eating quickly, while [Liu Guilan] sits beside him, smiling contentedly.
0:17:4|0:17:8|[Liu Guilan] sat aside, watching [Li Guofu] laughing happily.
0:17:16|0:17:23|After speaking, Li Guofu quickly took a sip of wine and anxiously looked at the other people in the square.
0:17:34|0:17:56|He quickly stuffed two more bites into his mouth, then picked up the suona and walked towards the square side by side with [Liu Guilan]. Dozens of elderly people in uniform clothing on the square were a fixed yangko dance team, and everyone who had been waiting for a long time saw the two coming over and happily started cheering.
0:18:10|0:18:18|As the soul of the team, [Li Guofu] energetically plays the suona, and with the suona and drum sounds, everyone quickly immerses themselves in it.
0:18:22|0:18:46|With Li Guofu leading the yangko team, consisting of three to fifty people divided into two groups, two middle-aged ladies with flower umbrellas lead the others in dancing on the square. The other ladies, holding two gorgeous fans, stand in four rows and dance each move in a neat and uniform manner. Liu Guilan is among them. On the side of the square, with Li Guofu's suona as the main instrument, there are various instruments such as big and small cymbals, drums, and gongs.
0:18:46|0:18:50|[Liu Guilan] danced happily while looking at [Li Guofu] who was focused.
0:18:54|0:19:0|On the other side, [Li Faqun], who did not go to the square with [Li Guofu], walked alone towards a hair salon.
0:19:1|0:19:13|On a cold winter day, [Ping Wa] is walking through the alleyways in a thin coat. Inside the barbershop, a lady is giving a customer a shoulder massage, and that person is [Li Li].
0:19:13|0:19:26|[Li Li] vigorously taps on the shoulders of the customer with her hands clasped together, and the customer falls asleep with his eyes closed comfortably under the massage.
0:19:29|0:19:49|At this moment, [Li Guofu] walked to the entrance of the barbershop. Upon reaching the entrance, he glanced inside and, seeing a customer, gently pushed the door open and walked in. After closing the door, he habitually sat on the sofa. Seeing [Li Guofu] in the mirror, [Ping Wa] was afraid of disturbing the customer, so she remained silent and continued working.
0:19:49|0:20:13|[Li Guofu] sat on the sofa and suddenly noticed a cast iron bowl with noodles in the corner of the stove. He glanced at [Ping Wa] who was working, then took out a sealed egg from his pocket. After opening the package, he put the egg in the bowl. After placing the egg, he put the sealed package back in his pocket and sat on the sofa quietly waiting.
0:20:13|0:20:28|During this time, the phone of the guest rang. While the guest was answering the phone, [Li Li] stood up, tiredly rubbed her neck, and then turned to make a gesture to [Li Faqun].
0:20:36|0:20:56|The guest stood up while talking and took out a 100 yuan bill, placed it on the table, then turned and left. [Li Li] warmly greeted the departing guest, even though the guest didn't look back. [Li Li] habitually waved her hand, and only after the guest had walked far away did she close the door. On the sofa, [Ping Wa] quietly watched [Li Li], then anxiously looked at the instant noodles on the stove.
0:20:58|0:21:7|After seeing off the guests, [Li Li] came in, walked straight to her seat, and started tidying up the things she had just used. After putting everything in place, [Li Li] looked at herself in the mirror.
0:21:7|0:21:28|Li Guofu looked [Ping Wa] up and down. [Ping Wa], who had a slightly chubby figure, was wearing knee-high boots with a thin flesh-colored stocking, a leather shorts reaching her thighs over the stocking, and a long sweater almost covering the shorts. She had fluffy hair and a slightly round face, which matched well together.
0:21:28|0:21:41|[Li Guofu] sat on the sofa, staring straight at [Ping Wa] who was tidying up. After finishing, [Ping Wa] sat down and started eating instant noodles with eggs from the stove, but [Li Guofu] had already left outside the door.
0:21:41|0:22:0|After the folk dance performance, everyone went home except for [Li Guofu] and [Liu Guilan], who were chatting by the city wall in the square. [Li Guofu] let out a long sigh, and upon seeing this, [Liu Guilan] spoke,
0:22:6|0:22:15|Seeing [Li Guofu] bowing his head and hesitating without speaking, she then quickly continued,
0:23:29|0:23:44|[Li Guofu] had a sudden inspiration and asked, while [Liu Guilan] looked at the serious [Li Guofu] and raised her head to think.
0:25:19|0:25:26|[Li Guofu] shyly twisted his body nervously and asked,
0:25:36|0:25:52|After saying that, he awkwardly smiled, lowered his head in self-deprecation, and she rode away on her bike. [Li Guofu] looked at Liu Guilan's back in confusion until she disappeared from his sight.
0:25:53|0:26:1|The next day, [Li Guofu] was still setting up his stall in the community as usual. At that moment, he was fixing a flat tire for a delivery guy who was eating a Chinese hamburger.
0:26:1|0:26:7|[Li Guofu] asked while fixing the tire,
0:28:5|0:28:12|The young man looked at [Li Guofu] in confusion.
0:28:32|0:28:37|Excited [Li Guofu] sat down to continue repairing the tire, while Xiaoge continued to eat meat buns heartily in the car.
0:28:42|0:29:3|During dinner, the father and son placed the table by the stove. [Ping Wa] peeled garlic while [Li Guofu] scooped a spoonful of hot oil from the stove and poured it onto the noodles in [Ping Wa]'s bowl. He stirred it with chopsticks, and a bowl of authentic Shaanxi-style oil-splashed noodles was ready.
0:29:3|0:29:15|[Li Guofu] smiled satisfactorily at [Ping Wa], then he picked up the wine on the table and poured himself a glass. After taking a sip thoughtfully, he said to [Ping Wa],
0:29:35|0:29:43|Ping Wa spoke up at this moment, "Would they want me?" Ping Wa repeated again, "Would they want me?"
0:29:55|0:30:16|[Ping Wa] frowned and nodded after listening, while [Li Guofu] scooped a spoonful of hot oil and poured it onto his noodles. The cooked dry noodles were topped with vegetables and chili powder. The aroma spread instantly after the hot oil cooking, and the two of them happily started eating dinner.
0:30:16|0:30:24|The next day, [Li Guofu] brought [Ping Wa] to the express delivery company. In the spacious and bright corridor, employees in uniforms could be seen everywhere.
0:30:24|0:30:40|[Ping Wa] kept looking towards [Li Guofu] in the corridor. Soon, [Li Guofu] came out of the office, dressed in a suit with a leather bag sandwiched between his arms, and carrying a lot of things in his hands. Unexpectedly, he was pushed out by Manager Wang holding his hand. When they reached the door, Manager Wang impatiently said,
0:30:51|0:30:57|Ping Wa, standing aside, saw Li Guofu being shut out and angrily turned away.
0:30:57|0:31:28|Li Guofu, still trying to figure out a solution outside the door, could only chase after them when he saw what was happening. After being rejected, Li Guofu rode a tricycle back with his son. Both of them were extremely low in spirits on the ride, silent, neither saying a word. Li Guofu looked back at his son sitting in the back seat, holding the rejected gift silently. His seemingly plain face was furrowed with a frown, unable to hide the frustration in his heart.
0:31:28|0:31:36|Facing forward while driving, the father felt sadness and unwillingness welling up in his heart. [Li Guofu], who felt sorry for his son, also had tears in his eyes.
0:31:36|0:32:9|Returning home, [Li Guofu] was drumming on his homemade drum set, feeling at a loss. He looked at his disappointed son lying on the bed and comforted him. The son turned away from [Li Guofu], who suddenly realized and said,
0:32:14|0:32:19|His son, with tears in his eyes, suddenly sat up from the bed and said laboriously,
0:32:44|0:33:7|[Ping Wa] heard it and picked up his clothes and ran out. [Li Guofu] sat down helplessly, but accidentally touched the drum set. Startled, [Li Guofu] sat there quietly without saying a word, just staring at the lingering sound of the cymbals.
0:33:7|0:33:39|[Ping Wa] ran out of the house and arrived at Lili's hair salon. Lili was washing clothes while [Ping Wa] sat on the sofa. They watched TV together. After the first wash, Lili needed to add more water, so she called [Ping Wa]. As [Ping Wa] was about to pour water into the basin, he saw the underwear that Lili was washing and accidentally spilled water on her.
0:33:39|0:34:8|He quickly put down the water kettle, but it was also knocked over on the ground. [Ping Wa] looked flustered at Li Li, who finished speaking and walked into the inner room. The overturned water kettle swayed next to the basin filled with underwear. Li Li changed clothes in the inner room, came out without blaming [Ping Wa] too much, sat down and continued washing clothes. [Ping Wa] also picked up the mop to dry the water on the floor. After drying it, he mopped the entire floor again, as if trying to make up for his mistake.
0:34:8|0:34:20|Li Guofu continued to wash the clothes one by one without any concern. On the other side, the manager of the express delivery company and his girlfriend came out from the company, unaware that Ping Wa had already hidden behind the car.
0:34:20|0:34:27|The two unsuspecting individuals walked towards the car, chatting and laughing.
0:34:47|0:34:53|[Li Guofu] smiled awkwardly, then Manager Wang continued,
0:35:18|0:35:23|After Li Guofu finished speaking and walked away with a smile, his girlfriend standing beside him complained.
0:35:31|0:35:53|After the scare, Manager Wang drove with his girlfriend towards the hot pot restaurant. When Manager Wang looked in the rearview mirror, he suddenly saw Li Guofu riding a bicycle following behind the car. Manager Wang turned his head in disbelief to watch Li Guofu pedaling hard. Li Guofu at the back of the car saw Manager Wang looking at him, smiled at him, waved, and then pedaled even harder.
0:35:53|0:36:25|At this moment, the girlfriend also noticed [Li Guofu]. Manager Wang let go of his girlfriend's hand, tightly gripped the steering wheel, prepared to accelerate and leave [Li Guofu] behind. The car smoothly turned and sped up on the unobstructed road. Manager Wang kept looking in the rearview mirror, constantly confirming that [Li Guofu] was not following. Later, the two happily finished eating hotpot at the hotpot restaurant.
0:36:25|0:36:27|Manager Wang told a joke to his girlfriend, Li Guofu.
0:36:42|0:37:5|The waiter walked towards the two of them at this moment, and said to Manager Wang. Manager Wang, with a surprised look on his face, turned around to see a familiar figure. He then got up and walked towards [Li Guofu]. His girlfriend sitting across from him also curiously watched [Li Guofu]'s back. Manager Wang walked slowly closer, and when he realized it was [Li Guofu], he impatiently said as he walked back,
0:37:18|0:37:24|After sitting down, [Li Guofu] awkwardly smiled at Manager Wang, who also smiled and said,
0:37:27|0:37:34|Manager Wang leaned in slightly closer to [Li Guofu] and said earnestly,
0:40:3|0:40:10|To celebrate Ping Wa finding a job, Li Guofu bought chicken, duck, fish, and meat, preparing to share with the neighbors in the evening. Neighbor Lao Zhang walked over and said,
0:40:59|0:41:23|The two continued to wipe the car. [Li Guofu] saw the smile on [Ping Wa]'s face, and he smiled with relief as well, feeling a huge weight lifted off his heart. [Ping Wa] put on his helmet, dressed in uniform and new shoes, rode the shiny electric bike to the front of the barbershop, looking radiant as he gazed at Li Li inside. He honked the horn, and upon hearing it, Li Li walked out of the house.
0:41:24|0:41:38|Standing outside the door, Li Li crossed her arms in front of her chest, carefully examining the transformed [Ping Wa]. She nodded at [Ping Wa], then remembered something and walked towards the room.
0:41:38|0:41:42|[Ping Wa] sat in the car, quietly looking at the house, he didn't say a word.
0:41:42|0:42:8|After a while, Li Li came out with her bag and sat in the back seat of [Ping Wa]'s car. [Ping Wa] drove Li Li through the rugged alleys, with Li Li sitting sideways in the back seat, holding [Ping Wa]'s waist with both hands. The two of them happily rode towards the city center, their faces filled with smiles of happiness. Passersby also looked at them as they passed by, and [Ping Wa] enjoyed the joyful time spent with Li Li at that moment.
0:42:8|0:42:17|When riding on a sparsely populated road, [Ping Wa] sped up to scare Li Li on the back seat, amusing her in his somewhat childish way.
0:42:17|0:42:28|On the other side, at [Li Guofu]'s house, everyone happily sang songs after finishing their meal.
0:43:15|0:43:44|At this moment, [Ping Wa] and Li Li arrived at the upscale shopping mall in the city center. Inside the beautifully decorated mall, [Ping Wa] followed behind Li Li with his helmet in hand. Li Li strolled in front of various cosmetic counters. As she walked up to one counter and picked up a sample on display, the enthusiastic salesperson in front of the counter said,
0:44:9|0:44:18|Li Guofu followed the salesperson and ran to undergo the test. The salesperson's device then slowly moved on Li Li's face, and the screen of the computer was also in motion.
0:44:37|0:44:43|After saying that, she took out a set of cosmetics and placed it in front of [Li Guofu].
0:45:9|0:45:13|After Lili got up from the counter, she pulled Ping Wa, who was waiting beside her.
0:45:13|0:45:22|[Ping Wa] turned around and took note of this set of cosmetics. That night, Liu Guilan and [Li Guofu] had dinner at the restaurant.
0:45:37|0:45:42|While eating, she filled a bowl of food for [Li Guofu] and poured him a glass of wine.
0:46:3|0:46:10|[Li Guofu] incredulously pursed his lips,
0:47:13|0:47:19|At this moment, [Ping Wa]'s blind date partner walked in with a bowl of noodle soup.
0:47:59|0:48:14|After saying that, the blind date partner Xiao Ya turned and left. [Li Guofu] looked satisfied as he watched Xiao Ya's back. Liu Guilan turned proudly to [Li Guofu] and [Li Guofu] couldn't help but feel content. He raised his glass to Liu Guilan.
0:48:22|0:48:29|Back home, [Li Guofu] had [Ping Wa] put on his suit, while he sat down to polish his shoes.
0:48:38|0:48:58|[Ping Wa] looked at himself in a suit in the mirror, feeling awkward. [Li Guofu] glanced at him, then threw a tie to him. [Ping Wa] looked down at the tie in his hand with confusion, then looked at himself in the mirror. He frowned, sighed, and said slowly, "I have to go to work tomorrow," using going to work as an excuse.
0:49:10|0:49:22|After listening, [Ping Wa] threw the tie on the bed and impatiently said, "I'm not going." His father hit him with a shoe brush while speaking.
0:49:32|0:49:51|Sitting on the edge of the bed, [Ping Wa] lay down in frustration, while [Li Guofu] saw his rebellious son helplessly raise the brush as if to hit him, then restrained himself. He continued to polish the shoes, sighing deeply, and reluctantly kept polishing [Ping Wa]'s shoes.
0:49:52|0:50:2|The next evening, Liu Guilan brought [Li Guofu] and [Ping Wa] to Xiaoya's restaurant. Xiaoya poured tea for them in the private room, while Xiaoya's father took out a cigarette and said,
0:50:32|0:50:52|Shortly after, the parents from both sides walked out. The last to leave, [Li Guofu], worriedly whispered in [Ping Wa]'s ear. [Ping Wa] looked expressionless, casting a sidelong glance at his father as he left. Once outside, the parents engaged in conversation.
0:50:59|0:51:17|In the private room, Ya Ya spoke first, while [Ping Wa] kept his head down without expression, remaining silent and even without the slightest change in expression.
0:51:42|0:51:48|At this moment, [Ping Wa] nodded. Seeing that [Ping Wa] still didn't speak, Xiaoya suddenly became emotional and questioned,
0:51:53|0:52:22|[Ping Wa] continued to nod silently, while Little Ya anxiously asked, [Ping Wa] repeated the same action. Little Ya, feeling anxious, hesitated to speak, while the parents continued their conversation. [Li Guofu] nervously glanced inside the private room from time to time. [Ping Wa] sat there motionless, and at this moment, Little Ya felt more and more aggrieved, so she pouted and started to cry.
0:52:22|0:52:28|Li Faqun finally looked up at the increasingly crying Ping Wa, then got up and walked out the door.
0:52:29|0:52:33|Li Faqun walked out of the private room, striding towards the door without looking back.
0:52:33|0:52:50|Li Guofu's father saw Ping Wa going out and hurried into the private room. He saw the little girl crying and scolded her before chasing after her. At this moment, Liu Guilan and the little girl's parents also walked towards the private room. Seeing this, Liu Guilan quickly asked,
0:53:44|0:53:50|Li Guofu was angrily hitting while talking to Ping Wa outside.
0:53:58|0:54:15|Impatient [Ping Wa] quickly ran away, leaving his father [Li Guofu] standing in place, angrily cursing. He then kicked a utility pole in frustration, causing a billboard on top to suddenly loosen. [Li Guofu] swiftly dodged out of the way.
0:54:18|0:54:24|The blind date situation gradually turned a new leaf as time passed, and [Li Guofu] also gradually became acquainted with his colleagues.
0:54:24|0:54:40|At noon, [Li Guofu] and his colleagues were happily eating belt noodles together. Although [Li Guofu] had hearing and speech impairments, his enthusiastic colleagues did not discriminate against him. They still talked to him from time to time. This seemingly ordinary matter brought great joy to [Li Guofu].
0:54:40|0:54:49|After work, [Li Guofu] often goes to Lily's hair salon. When there are no customers, he watches TV with her. When there are customers, [Li Guofu] helps out.
0:54:50|0:55:1|While Li Guofu quietly held the necessary tools on the side as Li Li permed the guest's hair, Li Li conveniently picked up the hair dye in Li Guofu's hand and applied it to the guest.
0:55:1|0:55:8|When working, [Li Guofu] quietly watched her, enjoying their exclusive time together in the hair salon.
0:55:8|0:55:22|The next day, [Li Guofu] and his father went to work together. When the tricycle stalled again, [Li Guofu] didn't push from behind this time. Instead, he connected the tricycle to the electric bike and used a rope to pull the tricycle along.
0:55:22|0:55:33|[Li Guofu] wearing sunglasses, arrogantly looks at his son on the tricycle. The two occasionally shout loudly. In front, [Li Guofu] looks back at the spirited [Li Guofu] from time to time, and then laughs happily.
0:55:33|0:55:41|The scene of the two of them together is very heartwarming. After work, [Li Guofu] went to the mall alone and looked at the cosmetics in the display case.
0:55:41|0:55:44|The shop assistant on the side was promoting to others,
0:56:9|0:56:22|In the evening, [Li Guofu] and [Ping Wa] were eating dinner at home while watching a music program on TV. [Li Guofu] looked at the TV and asked [Ping Wa],
0:56:28|0:56:37|Ping Wa glanced at [Li Guofu] and said vaguely, "He's more capable than you."
0:56:45|0:57:4|Ping Wa ate noodles nonchalantly and then glanced at the musical instruments.
0:57:6|0:57:19|[Li Guofu] thought for a moment and asked Ping Wa. Ping Wa put down his chopsticks and explained, "They only wash their hair, they don't shave their heads. Rich people don't wash their hair at home."
0:57:40|0:57:49|After listening to Ping Wa, [Li Guofu] pondered with a turn of his eyes. After dinner, Ping Wa went to Lili's hair salon as usual.
0:57:49|0:58:18|[Li Guofu] finished washing the dishes at home, playing music with a touch of sentiment. He took off his tattered leather jacket and walked to the mirror, picking up the suit on the mannequin next to him. He put on the suit, and in the mirror, the mannequin, half a head taller than [Li Guofu], was wearing his proudest outfit. After putting on the suit, [Li Guofu] took off the tie from the mannequin's neck and hung it around his own neck, staring blankly at his reflection in the mirror.
0:58:18|0:58:33|He found that he couldn't tie a tie at all. After blinking his eyes and thinking for a while, he started to try, putting the tie on and off in a decent manner. However, after several attempts, he found that it was all wrong. He impatiently pulled the tie off his neck.
0:58:39|0:58:54|He then picked up the sunglasses hanging on the mannequin's head and put them on his own face. After carefully examining himself with the sunglasses on, he adjusted his beard and shook his head. He looked at himself from different angles, then smiled satisfactorily, patted the mannequin's face, and walked out the door.
0:58:56|0:59:8|[Li Guofu] went to the front of Lili's hair salon after leaving home, only to see him wearing a suit but with a very mismatched pair of sneakers and white socks on his feet, and his suit pants were too short.
0:59:8|0:59:15|Li Guofu revealed his long johns. He walked up to the door with light steps, adjusted his clothes once again, and then pushed the door open.
0:59:17|0:59:22|In the room, Li Guofu and Ping Wa both stood up when they saw the situation. Li Guofu exclaimed in surprise,
0:59:23|0:59:34|[Li Guofu] said arrogantly, then sat down. Beside him, [Li Li] watched as [Li Faqun] covered his mouth and laughed, while [Li Faqun] stood beside him, staring blankly at his father, unable to speak.
0:59:34|0:59:38|[Li Guofu] saw [Lili] covering her mouth and laughing, and said,
0:59:44|0:59:54|After speaking, [Lili] took out a towel and draped it over [Li Guofu]'s shoulders. On the side, [Li Faqun] came to his senses, but still didn't know the purpose of his father coming to wash his hair.
0:59:54|1:0:15|With a puzzled look on his face, [Li Guofu] watched as [Li Li] sprayed water evenly on his hair after draping a towel over him. Meanwhile, [Ping Wa] observed this scene with a pensive expression, lowering his head and thinking for a moment. Feeling awkward, [Ping Wa] got up and left the hair salon.
1:0:17|1:0:43|[Lili] watched as [Li Guofu] walked out without saying a word, continuing to spray water with a spray bottle. Sitting down, [Li Guofu] didn't even turn his head when he heard the sound. After wetting his hair, [Lili] used shampoo to scratch [Li Guofu]'s scalp. She chuckled as she scratched, looking at [Li Guofu] in the mirror wearing sunglasses and furrowing his brow. Mischievously, [Lili] increased the speed of scratching his scalp.
1:0:43|1:0:56|Li Guofu, who had never experienced such a service before, was scratched by Ping Wa until his scalp tingled and his whole body went limp. Li Guofu sat in the chair, tightly squeezing his legs together as if sitting on pins and needles, gripping the armrest tightly, feeling the hairs on his body standing on end.
1:0:56|1:1:4|Even so, [Li Guofu] still maintained a calm expression, sitting there without a word, waiting for the hair washing to finish.
1:1:4|1:1:12|With [Li Guofu] gradually getting used to it as [Lili] repeatedly scratched his scalp with her fingertips, even his expression became much more relaxed.
1:1:12|1:1:27|After the end of this wonderful hair washing experience, [Li Guofu] had his hair dried by [Lili] with a hairdryer. Having just experienced a scalp massage, blow-drying his hair was a piece of cake for [Li Guofu].
1:1:27|1:1:34|He sat in the chair with sunglasses on indifferently. After carefully blow-drying Li Guofu's hair, Ping Wa took off the towel and said,
1:1:36|1:1:50|[Li Guofu] stood up and leaned in front of the mirror, carefully examining himself. Then he took out 20 yuan and placed it on the table, saying proudly,
1:1:52|1:2:2|Surprised, [Li Guofu] took off his sunglasses and looked at Li Li, then glanced at the 20 yuan on the table. He then took out two 10 yuan bills and placed them on the table, continuing to speak.
1:2:4|1:2:7|[Li Guofu] awkwardly put on sunglasses and walked out.
1:2:15|1:2:32|The next day was payday at the express delivery company. Everyone crowded around the office door, chatting in groups as they received their wages, discussing plans to go out for drinks after getting paid.
1:2:32|1:2:54|The spacious corridor was crowded by the delivery guy in uniform, and in the crowd, [Li Guofu] was also eagerly waiting to receive his salary. Fortunately, the process of everyone receiving their pay was quick, just needed to tell the finance staff their name, and the finance staff would find it in the form. At this moment, finally [Li Guofu] walked in.
1:2:59|1:3:18|[Li Guofu] quickly took out a pen from his pocket after listening, wrote his name in the palm of his hand, and handed it to the finance department. [Li Guofu] nodded vigorously, and then the finance department started looking for it in the form.
1:3:21|1:3:39|[Li Guofu] mistakenly thought there was an error in the finances, so he reached out his hand towards the finance department, pointing to the name on his palm. The finance staff nodded, then checked the prepared salary envelope and the form, confirming that there was no mistake. Finally, picking up the phone, he turned to [Li Guofu] and said,
1:4:0|1:4:16|[Li Guofu] strained to listen to the voice on the phone outside the door, while employees peeked through the crack to see what was happening inside. [Li Guofu] angrily pushed the door open and ran out, leaving his puzzled colleagues speechless. The manager quickly followed him out.
1:4:33|1:4:56|In the corridor, [Li Guofu] angrily takes off the company uniform and throws it on the ground while running. The manager behind picks up the clothes and continues to shout and chase after him. Walking out of the express delivery company, [Li Guofu] walks alone on the street, feeling frustrated about working hard during this period but not getting paid.
1:5:35|1:5:51|[Li Guofu] hung up the phone and went to find Manager Wang. [Liu Guilan] stopped in worry, watching [Li Guofu] walk away.
1:5:52|1:6:0|In the car, after the manager and [Li Guofu] discussed the situation during the day, both of them sat in silence, unsure of what to do. Suddenly, Manager Wang asked,
1:6:45|1:7:1|Shortly after, Manager Wang got off the car and walked towards the home of [Li Guofu], who watched Manager Wang with grateful eyes. Manager Wang quickly reached the door of [Li Guofu]'s house and knocked on it. Inside the car, [Li Guofu] was afraid that [Ping Wa] would see him, so he hid himself further down.
1:7:1|1:7:19|At this moment, [Ping Wa] opened the door and was somewhat surprised to see the manager at the door. The manager took out his wallet from his pocket, pulled out 2000 yuan and handed it to [Ping Wa]. After taking the money, [Ping Wa] looked at the manager, who patted his shoulder, said a few encouraging words, and then walked towards the car.
1:7:19|1:7:27|[Ping Wa] looked at the money, then at the manager in the distance, entered the room and closed the door. Meanwhile, [Li Guofu] in the car seemed to feel relieved seeing this scene.
1:7:27|1:7:36|Turning to look at Manager Wang who walked to the front of the car. Manager Wang opened the door and sat in the car, while [Li Guofu] stood by, anxiously asking with a smile on his face,
1:7:51|1:7:55|Then he opened the car door and thanked [Li Guofu] again.
1:8:0|1:8:11|In the car, Manager Wang looked at Li Guofu walking towards his home with a sense of emotion. Li Guofu, who was attentive, was afraid of his son finding out that Manager Wang came to deliver money because of him.
1:8:11|1:8:18|So Li Guofu got off the car and walked to the door without rushing in, instead pacing at the entrance. In order to protect his son's self-esteem, [Ping Wa].
1:8:18|1:8:26|In the cold winter in the north, the elderly [Li Guofu], despite dressing warmly, still needs to walk back and forth to ensure the temperature of his body.
1:8:26|1:8:38|[Li Guofu] clutched the suona with his arms, constantly rubbing his hands, and occasionally peeked through the crack in the courtyard door into the house. He wanted to go in but hesitated, as if the longer he waited, the less likely he would be discovered.
1:8:38|1:8:46|Suddenly, the neighbor came out of the outhouse in the yard with his pants in hand and asked [Li Guofu], who was standing there,
1:9:10|1:9:16|To cover up the lie, [Li Guofu] awkwardly pretended to be exercising in the yard, stretching his arms and moving around.
1:9:17|1:9:29|Seeing the neighbor enter the house, [Li Guofu] gently pushed open the door and walked in. Walking into the inner room, he nervously looked at his son watching TV.
1:9:32|1:9:40|Later, [Li Guofu] saw the money Manager Wang had sent on the table and pretended to just find out, saying to [Ping Wa],
1:11:8|1:11:14|[Ping Wa] wiped away tears and stood up excitedly, saying, "What's the use of just talking big? If you're so capable, go on TV and brag about it!"
1:11:19|1:11:25|[Li Guofu] watched as [Ping Wa] promised tearfully with a sense of inferiority.
1:11:39|1:11:46|[Li Guofu] defiantly made a bold statement. At this point, the relationship between the father and son working together hit rock bottom once again.
1:11:49|1:12:6|A few days later, Li Guofu and Ping Wa finished collecting scrap as usual in the evening. Riding their tricycle on the way back home, the engine stalled again. Ping Wa, as usual, started pushing the tricycle, but after a few steps, he let go of the handle and stood still.
1:12:6|1:12:33|In the car, [Li Guofu] noticed something unusual and sat there with a vacant look, deep in thought. After the car was pushed for a while, [Li Guofu] stepped on the brake, slowly turned to look at [Ping Wa] who was standing still in a daze. The son was feeling low, gazing at the roadside, reminiscing about their experiences during this period. They both came from the countryside, and he, being disabled, could only rely on collecting scrap for a living in the city with his father.
1:12:33|1:12:56|Any decent matter has nothing to do with oneself. Thinking about these, [Ping Wa] looked despairingly and helplessly into the distance. After staring at his despondent son for a while, [Li Guofu] turned back. He knew why his son was like this, but as a father, he didn't know how to talk to his son. Instead, he sat on the tricycle with his head down in frustration. The two of them appeared particularly desolate on the deserted road.
1:12:56|1:13:1|After some time, one evening, [Li Guofu] was helping out at the hair salon.
1:13:3|1:13:20|[Ping Wa] had just finished washing a regular customer's hair and was blow-drying it. [Li Guofu] added charcoal to the stove and sat on the sofa watching [Ping Wa]. While washing the hair, an old customer named Wang invited [Ping Wa] to join a party. After blow-drying Wang's hair, [Ping Wa] politely declined, saying,
1:13:48|1:13:54|Wang Ge turned around and looked at Li Guofu on the sofa, saying to Ping Wa,
1:14:5|1:14:14|After Wang Ge finished speaking and walked out of the store, Ping Wa, who was reluctant to go, was afraid of offending the old customers. With a sullen face and head lowered, he eventually compromised.
1:15:30|1:15:35|And she just kept changing positions on the sofa, taking photos without paying attention to [Li Guofu]'s intentions.
1:15:42|1:15:50|Feeling bored, [Li Guofu] stood up and walked out of the private room to go to the restroom. Inside the room, no one even bothered to look up at him, continuing on.
1:15:53|1:16:1|[Li Guofu] shuttles through the corridor of the KTV, looking for the restroom, while the sound of songs from other private rooms still echoes in his ears, creating a noisy atmosphere.
1:16:2|1:16:25|[Li Guofu] walked into the restroom and closed the door. At that moment, the cleaning lady knocked on the door and asked, then pushed it open to find [Li Guofu] in the middle of using the toilet. [Li Guofu] hurriedly pulled up his pants, and the cleaning lady, annoyed, complained as she walked away. Inside, [Li Guofu], now fully dressed, was breathing heavily in anger.
1:16:30|1:16:37|After a moment, he turned around and quickly walked back into the private room.
1:16:40|1:16:46|Back in the private room, [Li Guofu] felt a surge of grievance and anger.
1:16:52|1:17:0|After Wang Ge finished speaking, [Li Faqun] couldn't help but stand up, pick up the full bottle of white wine on the table, and drink it in big gulps with his head tilted back.
1:17:2|1:17:26|[Li Guofu] had tears in his eyes, even though he couldn't swallow the white wine. He still held up the bottle. Throughout the night, everyone remained silent and looked at [Li Guofu]. At this moment, [Ping Wa] came over and snatched the bottle from him. [Ping Wa] had a serious expression and sharp eyes as she looked at [Li Guofu]. After glancing at [Ping Wa], [Li Guofu] lowered his head with a vacant look and gasped for breath heavily.
1:17:26|1:17:34|He, who was drunk, was then helped home by [Li Li].
1:17:46|1:18:18|At this moment, [Li Guofu] walked out of the door. [Lili] said apologetically, but [Li Guofu] didn't say a word. He grabbed [Ping Wa], who was about to fall, and held him in his arms. Then he gave a fierce look at [Lili], slammed the door shut heavily. [Lili] stood alone at the door, staring blankly. When they got home, [Li Guofu] helped [Ping Wa] lie down on the bed, took off his clothes, and tucked him in.
1:18:18|1:18:53|Drunk [Ping Wa] occasionally hummed in his mouth. [Li Guofu] walked over and took his son's hearing aid. He looked at [Ping Wa], then at the hearing aid. With a sigh, [Li Guofu] stared blankly, seeing [Ping Wa] lying on the bed next to him, constantly humming. Helplessly, [Li Guofu] placed the hearing aid on the table and sighed deeply.
1:18:53|1:18:58|He sat in front of the table in a dejected manner, wearing a coat with a fur collar.
1:18:58|1:19:10|In a simple room with dim lighting, [Li Guofu] looked somewhat weary. He recalled all these things and his son's self-deprecating words in silence. Refusing to give up, he glanced at his son lying on the bed.
1:19:10|1:19:22|Recalling his own promise, he became even more determined to appear on TV. The next day, accompanied by [Liu Guilan] and the yangko dance team, he arrived at the TV program audition venue to encourage [Ping Wa].
1:19:22|1:19:31|Outside the door, all the contestants were actively preparing.
1:19:39|1:19:46|[Liu Guilan] handed a egg to [Li Guofu] who was eating with his mouth full.
1:19:55|1:19:58|After listening, he started eating heartily again.
1:20:5|1:20:23|[Li Guofu] was eating and drinking while swallowing water. Mmm, oh yeah, eat, eat me, hahaha. [Li Guofu] struggled to finish the sixth egg and kept burping non-stop.
1:20:23|1:20:30|Everyone gathered around him, giving him advice. As the time drew closer, other contestants outside were nervously practicing.
1:20:30|1:20:33|Only [Li Guofu] is still eating the eggs.
1:20:33|1:20:48|After a hot and sexy lady finished her dance, [Li Guofu] slowly walked down from the stage, timidly holding a suona. He bowed to the judges, and one of them spoke up,
1:20:55|1:20:59|The two judges below exchanged glances and smiled, saying,
1:21:50|1:21:58|[Li Guofu] scratched his nose in confusion,
1:22:34|1:22:52|He then placed the suona on the ground and cleared his throat. He hunched over, a bit hesitant, and struck a rock star pose, singing the lyrics in his head to the beat.
1:23:29|1:23:45|[Li Guofu] bowed and walked out. Outside the door, everyone asked anxiously, looking at each other without saying a word.
1:23:47|1:23:53|[Li Guofu] did not understand the implicit meaning of the judges, and started practicing day and night at home.
1:23:53|1:24:51|Li Guofu assembled instruments such as big cymbals, small cymbals, big drums, and small drums with steel wires and rollers, connected them with a homemade pedal, and used both hands and feet to strike them. His son, who was about to lie down to sleep, was disturbed by the noise, tossing and turning in bed. He then went out to the hair salon, where he continued to help Ping Wa with miscellaneous tasks as usual.
1:24:52|1:25:4|[Li Guofu] stood on a chair, focused on fixing the leaking water heater with a wrench. After tightening the screws and testing the switch, [Ping Wa] who was watching nearby, said to [Li Guofu], "It looks almost fixed."
1:25:10|1:25:39|Hearing this, [Li Guofu] put down the work in his hands, and after saying that, he patted [Ping Wa] on the shoulder, then walked to the seat to prepare the hair washing products. [Li Guofu] sat on the seat, staring blankly at the mirror. [Lili] was behind him, washing his hair like other customers, spraying water on the hair, applying shampoo, and ten fingers kept moving on [Li Guofu]'s scalp.
1:25:39|1:26:2|[Li Guofu] looked expressionless, with hollow eyes staring ahead, constantly thinking about [Ping Wa]'s imminent departure. There were too many words left unsaid in his heart, and the emotions of parting spread in [Li Guofu]'s heart. As he thought, his head lowered more and more. [Ping Wa] lifted [Li Guofu]'s lowering head and looked at him through the mirror. Despite appearing indifferent, [Ping Wa] also had a mix of emotions, with a thousand thoughts running through her mind.
1:26:2|1:26:19|In the emotional moment of parting, both of them remained silent. [Li Guofu] bid farewell to him in her own way, even though his attention was not on getting a haircut. She massaged him in a way that made him swallow saliva, causing his body hair to stand on end as he tightly gripped the armrest of the chair.
1:26:19|1:26:30|[Li Guofu] calmly looks at [Lili] in the mirror, cherishing the last few days together more and more. Gradually, a hint of tears appears in [Li Guofu]'s eyes.
1:26:34|1:26:42|As time passed, the broadcast time was getting closer. After hanging up the phone in the recording office, the staff said to the judges,
1:27:11|1:27:16|At this moment, the program director looked at the computer for the day's recording.
1:27:18|1:27:24|The staff then pressed pause, freezing the frame on the face of [Li Guofu]. Meanwhile, [Li Faqun] arrived at the shopping mall.
1:27:43|1:27:49|The salesperson watched as [Li Faqun] walked away quickly. Meanwhile, [Li Guofu] was nervously preparing backstage for the competition.
1:27:56|1:28:6|Liu Guilan handed the suona to [Li Guofu] and then took off her sunglasses, the two of them smiled slightly intimately and awkwardly.
1:28:6|1:28:12|At this moment, the stage crew has already placed the frame assembled by [Li Guofu] in the center of the stage. The host says,
1:28:41|1:28:48|Keep it up. Liu Guilan looked at the back of [Li Guofu] on stage with joy and excitement, her face filled with indescribable emotions towards [Li Guofu].
1:28:48|1:29:9|In the dimly lit waiting area, [Li Guofu] in a leather jacket, holding a suona, nervously takes deep breaths, thinking about his insecure son. [Li Guofu]'s anxious expression gradually turns resolute, as he slowly puts on sunglasses. The light in front of the stage shines through the cracks onto [Li Guofu]'s cheeks, giving him a somewhat old rock star look.
1:29:11|1:29:17|The gate of the waiting area gradually opens at this moment, and in front of the stage, the spotlight generously shines on [Li Guofu].
1:29:17|1:29:35|[Li Guofu] stood confidently with his head slightly raised, showing no trace of fear. He knew that he carried a love for music, his son's insecurity, and the expectations of Liu Guilan and everyone else. As the door opened completely, [Li Guofu] looked through his sunglasses at the dazzling spotlight, then walked slowly towards the stage.
1:29:35|1:29:47|When [Li Guofu] walked energetically to the center of the stage, applause erupted. After a deep bow to the audience, [Li Guofu] sat down in front of the drum set.
1:29:47|1:29:53|When [Li Guofu] was ready to start, everyone quieted down. Then [Li Guofu] picked up the suona and the performance was about to begin.
1:31:5|1:31:8|At this moment, [Li Guofu] walked up to the hair salon holding cosmetics.
1:31:15|1:31:24|Lili waved to [Li Guofu] to come in. When he entered, he looked at the TV in surprise and saw his father.
1:32:6|1:32:20|The audience was infected by the music of the old man on stage wearing sunglasses and gradually graying hair. Everyone waved their glow sticks in unison, and the judges on the judging panel nodded along to the rhythm. Backstage, [Liu Guilan] clapped her hands with tears of joy.
1:32:21|1:32:29|The neighbors in front of the TV were also swaying to the music, while [Li Guofu] stood there in shock, watching his father who was actually on TV.
