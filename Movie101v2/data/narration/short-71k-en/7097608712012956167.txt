0:1:19|0:1:26|With a loud noise, the scene shifts to the human experiment base at the IPT Research Institute on the English Island.
0:1:39|0:1:42|Cover up the truth of the explosion at the IPT research institute.
0:1:47|0:1:56|In this setting, the scene shifts to an office where [Cui Hu], played by Huo Jianhua, is sitting with his head down, while a foreigner across from him speaks.
0:2:0|0:2:3|[Cui Hu] slowly lifted his head, looking at the other person with a determined gaze.
0:2:36|0:2:40|The story is about to unfold from here.
0:2:40|0:2:52|The film mainly tells the story of a single mother [Xia Tian] played by Yang Mi, who is a senior researcher at the Institute of Physics. She and Long, played by Jin Shijie, the [Director], work together to develop a technology that allows living organisms to travel through wormholes for time travel.
0:2:53|0:2:59|When there was a breakthrough in the research, Zhang Yipeng played Xia Tian's son Dou Dou, but was kidnapped by Cui Hu.
0:2:59|0:3:3|[Cui Hu] threatens [Xia Tian] with [Dou Dou]'s life to hand over the particle technology.
0:3:3|0:3:10|In order to save [Dou Dou]'s life, [Xia Tian] takes a risk and uses the unfinished particle technology to go back one hour and fifty minutes ago.
0:3:10|0:3:15|But because of the repeated failures, [Xia Tian] crossed over more than once, making things even more complicated.
0:3:15|0:3:26|He encounters unexpected challenges and must confront the mutants in his time travel, engaging in a fierce battle with them. Meanwhile, the backstory of the kidnapper [Cui Hu] gradually emerges.
0:3:30|0:3:33|Continuing to tell you about the positive part.
0:3:33|0:3:53|Inside the Linkage Research Institute, numerous particles are gathering inside the transporter. [Xia Tian] and colleagues are busy at the control panel outside the data platform. The director is watching the imaging of the apes on the data platform. Several people stop their actions and turn towards the central data platform. Colleague [Huang Chen] covers her mouth, while [Da Xiong] clenches his fists.
0:4:13|0:4:16|Everyone was still immersed in the joy of the successful experiment.
0:4:16|0:4:20|[Director] puts the data screen into the data platform, and the platform automatically retracts it.
0:4:29|0:4:50|[Xia Tian] and [Cui Hu] both put their hands together in front of their mouths. [Xia Tian] visibly relaxed, while [Cui Hu] was extremely pleased. He even bowed his head and jumped a little with a file in his arms. [Huang Chen] happily waved his arms, [Da Xiong] scratched his head and clapped along with everyone. Then, everyone prepared to leave the database, and the screen faded to black.
0:4:50|0:4:52|Turning towards the cliffs of several high mountains.
0:4:52|0:5:0|[Xia Tian] is climbing with his son [Dou Dou], pulling himself up the grooves. [Dou Dou] leans his head over, looking down.
0:5:0|0:5:6|The two have climbed to a high position, with a view of the shorter mountains below.
0:5:17|0:5:24|Xia Tian, turning back, took two steps forward again, with adhesive tape wrapped around his index and ring fingers for better grip.
0:5:24|0:5:28|The phone vibrates, and [Xia Tian] takes it out of the pocket at his waist to answer.
0:5:36|0:5:41|[Xia Tian] was just hanging up the phone when suddenly [Dou Dou]'s rope snapped.
0:5:41|0:5:48|[Xia Tian] quickly unfastened his belt buckle, [Dou Dou] chased after him, and the ground revealed an electronic grid under his pressure.
0:6:2|0:6:4|Following behind, [Xia Tian] looked at [Dou Dou] with concern.
0:6:17|0:6:21|The virtual climbing scene gradually disappears, and the scene returns to [Xia Tian]'s home.
0:6:21|0:6:27|Later, [Xia Tian] drove across the high bridge spanning the sea and arrived at the research institute located on Azure Island.
0:6:37|0:6:44|[Xia Tian], who changed out of her sportswear, is dressed in formal attire and carrying a handbag as she walks through the lobby of the research institute.
0:6:44|0:6:49|Walking up the stairs, Xia Tian nodded to his colleagues and greeted them before entering the elevator after reaching the top floor.
0:6:49|0:6:54|As the elevator ascends, the exterior of the entire research institute comes into view.
0:6:54|0:6:58|After a short slope, the elevator went straight up to the conference room located high above.
0:7:1|0:7:5|In the meeting room, a research group of 5 people sit in a row facing the electronic screen.
0:7:5|0:7:8|Sitting in the center is the [Chairman of the Board].
0:7:56|0:7:59|The lights of the particle transporter turned on, explained [Xia Tian].
0:8:35|0:8:36|Xiang Dong then continued to explain.
0:9:3|0:9:4|[Xia Tian], who ended the meeting, headed to the parking lot to go home.
0:9:35|0:9:45|The car started slowly, with [Xia Tian] following behind a car that was driving away. Suddenly, a man threw himself onto the front windshield of the car.
0:9:56|0:9:59|The man shouted loudly at [Xia Tian] while pulling the door and rolling down the car window.
0:9:59|0:10:4|Suddenly, a large amount of blood gushed from the man's mouth, spraying onto the car window.
0:10:4|0:10:7|[Xia Tian] slammed on the brakes in shock.
0:10:7|0:10:9|Shortly after, security personnel arrived.
0:10:11|0:10:15|[Xia Tian] shook his head and asked the security team leader.
0:10:32|0:10:39|[Xia Tian] turned around with furrowed brows, walked towards the car, and glanced back a few times as he walked.
0:10:39|0:10:45|When I got back home, it was already late in the evening. As I walked through the door, the sound of a cartoon was coming from the television.
0:11:4|0:11:10|[Xia Tian] walked into the living room and saw [Dou Dou] already asleep on the sofa, holding a toy in his arms.
0:11:10|0:11:14|[Xia Tian] looked at [Dou Dou], he sighed softly, then turned to the TV.
0:11:20|0:11:36|He picked up the remote control from the coffee table, turned off the TV, then bent down to take the toy from [Dou Dou]'s arms and put it aside. With one hand around [Dou Dou]'s back and the other supporting his bottom, he lifted [Dou Dou] into his arms, holding him securely and even patting [Dou Dou]'s head.
0:11:36|0:11:39|Back in the bedroom, [Dou Dou] was already fast asleep on the bed.
0:11:39|0:11:46|[Xia Tian] looked at the painting [Dou Dou] did today, which depicted a mother and child standing under a rainbow, with the words "I Love Mom" written next to it in English.
0:11:49|0:12:3|After saying those words, [Xia Tian] also lay down on the bed, one hand resting beside her face, the other gently touching [Dou Dou]'s cheek. After stroking [Dou Dou]'s hair, she lightly kissed his forehead.
0:12:3|0:12:3|The screen fades to black.
0:12:7|0:12:13|[Cui Hu] stood on the opposite side of the Azure Island, smoking a cigarette, with the scar on his face still visible and not fully healed.
0:12:15|0:12:21|And on the terrace of the research institute he was gazing at, some staff members were busy with their own tasks.
0:12:21|0:12:28|At this moment, [Xia Tian] walked through the terrace carrying a bag, entered through the glass door, and greeted the colleague who was coming towards her with a gentle smile.
0:12:29|0:12:34|A pair of maintenance workers, led by a man in a suit, walk past him.
0:12:34|0:12:38|The man in the suit turned his head to look at [Xia Tian], then turned back and pressed the headphones.
0:12:38|0:12:52|Xia Tian and the others arrived at the underground research institute. Cui Hu, in a suit, stood by a monitor and, with some actions on his phone, turned the monitor towards the wall. Then, he gestured towards the back, and the maintenance team walked in orderly.
0:12:52|0:13:0|The man in a suit looked down through the grid cover on the ground, only to see the maintenance team had already walked down the stairs to the lower level.
0:13:0|0:13:14|The maintenance team arrived at the lower level of the room full of pipes, and several people started to act around, taking out small disc-shaped bombs and installing them in various places. One person waved his hand, and his partner tied the ropes with a bag. After finishing one installation, [Director], everyone has been conducting clinical experiments these days.
0:13:42|0:13:46|Later, [Xia Tian] and [Cui Hu] walked into the teleportation room.
0:14:10|0:14:11|[Xia Tian] nodded thoughtfully, smiling as if remembering something.
0:15:43|0:15:44|The two walked around the teleporter.
0:15:44|0:15:49|[Xia Tian] smiled and dodged the topic, while [Chief] reached into the pocket of his suit.
0:16:11|0:16:20|[Xia Tian] looked around, opened the cloth bag, and glanced at [Chief], who smiled without saying a word. [Xia Tian] took out something from inside, it was a watch.
0:16:20|0:16:22|After talking to the [Director], [Xia Tian] and [Da Xiong] arrived at the laboratory, where [Dou Dou] was looking through a microscope and reacted after being photographed.
0:16:39|0:16:43|[Xia Tian] moved to the front of the microscope, with [Cui Hu] explaining to him.
0:16:58|0:17:1|[Da Xiong] looked at Dong as he inserted the data, and asked.
0:17:29|0:17:32|Looking at the departing [Xia Tian] to the east, then turning to face the opposite direction.
0:17:35|0:17:44|Two people left the laboratory together, and on the screen, two monkeys were shown, one on the left and one on the right. The one on the right suddenly started moving, stretching its arms up and down.
0:17:44|0:17:54|The camera shifts to [Xia Tian], who has just set down a cup of coffee. The screen in front of him shows [Xia Tian], the chief researcher, undergoing regular self-defense training, with the current project being shooting.
0:17:55|0:17:59|She looked at the paper materials in her hand while sliding the display screen.
0:17:59|0:18:8|At this moment, the phone rang, and when [Dou Dou] appeared on the screen, [Xia Tian] smiled and cast the image onto the display screen. [Dou Dou] asked.
0:18:32|0:18:43|[Xia Tian] looked at the coffee in his hand and then set it down.
0:18:43|0:18:47|[Dou Dou] is dragged out of the screen.
0:18:47|0:18:48|[Xia Tian] is calling out to the screen.
0:18:57|0:19:3|[Xia Tian] turned around and ran out, drove home in a hurry, and made a phone call.
0:19:3|0:19:7|She didn't notice that she was already sandwiched between two cars.
0:19:11|0:19:16|The SUV behind suddenly accelerated and crashed directly into the rear of [Xia Tian]'s car.
0:19:16|0:19:22|[Xia Tian] pushed forward with force, quickly turned around to look back, but the car behind was still closely following.
0:19:22|0:19:25|[Xia Tian] turns the steering wheel, preparing to overtake the truck in front.
0:19:25|0:19:27|The truck unexpectedly also needs a steering wheel.
0:19:27|0:19:44|When in front of him, and the car behind caught up again, hitting the rear of [Xia Tian]'s car once more, [Xia Tian]'s head knocked against the steering wheel. He covered his forehead and looked back, only to find the off-road vehicle continuously hitting the rear of the car. [Xia Tian] tried to overtake through the gap, but was still blocked by the truck.
0:19:45|0:20:1|Like this, the off-road vehicle was pushing against the rear of [Xia Tian]'s car. Suddenly, the backboard of the truck in front opened and then dropped down. [Xia Tian] had to slam on the brakes, the board fell to the ground, and [Xia Tian]'s car was pushed into the truck's compartment. The backboard of the truck was slowly pulled back up, and [Xia Tian] shouted in panic.
0:20:7|0:20:12|In the dark train carriage, suddenly, a big light turns on, and [Xia Tian] calls out.
0:20:12|0:20:19|A man is lying on the hood of a car, another man is standing, both observing Xia Tian, who is also looking at them sideways.
0:20:19|0:20:24|At this moment, [Cui Hu] walked towards the car. With the light shining in his face, [Xia Tian] could only squint his eyes, and he saw [Dou Dou].
0:20:39|0:20:45|[Xia Tian] couldn't push the door open.
0:20:45|0:20:47|[Cui Hu] turned around and patted [Dou Dou]'s head.
0:21:5|0:21:9|After [Cui Hu] gestured, his subordinate picked up the briefcase and approached. [Cui Hu] then continued speaking.
0:21:25|0:21:26|[Xia Tian] is hammering the car windshield.
0:21:32|0:21:44|He watched as [Dou Dou] froze when the bomb was injected, while [Cui Hu] pointed at the watch and pressed the timer. The woman with a crew cut took [Dou Dou] away.
0:21:59|0:22:2|[Dou Dou] looked at his mother in the car and shouted loudly again.
0:22:8|0:22:10|[Xia Tian] tightly grips the steering wheel, biting her lip.
0:22:10|0:22:15|Next, the scene cuts back to the laboratory, where [Xiang Dong] is analyzing the data.
0:22:15|0:22:17|[Xiang Dong] turned around when he heard the noise.
0:22:26|0:22:29|At this moment, [Xia Tian] has already returned to the research institute.
0:22:29|0:22:33|He looked up at the central control room and called [Xiang Dong].
0:22:33|0:22:35|[Xiang Dong] watched as the data answered the phone.
0:22:42|0:22:50|[Xia Tian] ran wildly while hanging up the phone, ran through the terrace into the hall, bumped into people head-on without dodging, but pushed them directly.
0:22:50|0:22:53|Among them is a man in a suit carrying a bomb.
0:22:53|0:22:56|The man in a suit turned his head and watched [Xia Tian] enter a door with his back facing him.
0:22:58|0:23:17|[Xia Tian] ran up to the second floor of the analysis room, slowed down her pace, and after a moment of daze, she sat down on the ground in a daze. She first felt a sense of confusion, then covered her mouth with her hand, dry heaved, and only then did her emotions catch up. Her eyes were already wet with tears, and she looked around in terror, covering her mouth, afraid to make a sound.
0:23:17|0:23:23|And in front of her, lying in a pool of blood, was [Xia Tian], who crawled forward and gently pushed Dongxiang.
0:23:25|0:23:38|A ball rolled out, making [Xia Tian] jump back in fright. Hearing the noise, he nervously looked to the side and saw someone coming over for a meeting. Realizing no one noticed him, [Xia Tian] let out a sigh of relief.
0:23:38|0:23:52|Inside the round ball on the ground was an eyeball, and [Xia Tian] reached out to grab the eyeball. As he got closer, he closed his eyes in pain, turned his head away, and his hand trembled uncontrollably at the side. Finally, he frowned and picked it up.
0:23:56|0:24:1|[Xia Tian] was startled by the sudden vibration of his phone, and he immediately looked around in panic.
0:24:1|0:24:5|He quickly answered the phone, hearing Cui Hu's voice urging him on the other end.
0:24:5|0:24:9|At this moment, [Huang Chen] walks into the first floor.
0:24:27|0:24:32|[Xia Tian] got up from the ground, looked around, and then fixed her gaze on the mirror on the table.
0:24:36|0:24:37|[Huang Chen] asked.
0:25:0|0:25:3|[Xia Tian] stood on the stairs and took over the file wall.
0:25:16|0:25:22|Watching [Huang Chen] walk downstairs, [Xia Tian] leaned against the stairs and then hurriedly went upstairs.
0:25:22|0:25:25|Every two steps, a phone rings.
0:25:25|0:25:30|[Xia Tian] looked down and saw [Huang Chen] holding a phone, so she could only wave her hand to urge him.
0:25:34|0:25:47|Watching [Huang Chen] leave, [Xia Tian] looked up at the filing cabinet. Then, holding the eyeball in one hand and using his suit to cover it, he hurried downstairs. However, he accidentally knocked over someone else's folder, bumped into a woman with a cart while passing through the crowd, and was asked by a colleague.
0:25:49|0:25:57|[Xia Tian] winced in pain, but still waved his hand. After speaking, he pranced away flamboyantly. Shortly after, [Chief] appeared behind him and asked, "What are you doing here, [Xia Tian]?"
0:26:15|0:26:19|[Director] was taken aback by these words, turned around, and the two of them arrived at the data room.
0:26:19|0:26:23|The director's eyes were fixed on the recognizer, and after it recognized, he spoke.
0:26:26|0:26:30|The departing [Director] turned around and asked.
0:26:48|0:26:59|After Director [left], [Xia Tian] took out an eyeball from his pocket, held it in front of the scanner with both hands, and the screen above showed that the iris recognition of the three individuals had been completed.
0:26:59|0:27:2|Soon, the data key was generated and popped out from the checkpoint.
0:27:9|0:27:29|[Xia Tian] breathed a sigh of relief, picked up the key and quickly entered the data room. Stepping onto the central console, she inserted the key and swiftly started inputting. As one load finished, she removed the key and continued inputting on the other side, until the main display showed four data loads completed, reaching the final step.
0:27:30|0:27:37|[Xia Tian] reached out and raised his hand, entering information on the screen above. After completing it, he watched the loading progress slowly reach 10%.
0:27:39|0:27:45|At the same time, [Huang Chen], who received the information, returned to the analysis room.
0:27:45|0:27:53|[Huang Chen] walked up to the second floor, found no one, pouted, sighed, and swayed towards the table.
0:27:53|0:28:0|[Huang Chen] noticed that something was crushed underfoot. When she looked down, she saw a syringe. Just as she raised her head, she noticed the bloodstains under the filing cabinet.
0:28:2|0:28:7|On the other side, [Xia Tian] was inputting data according to the procedure while anxiously checking the time on her watch.
0:28:7|0:28:11|In the analysis room, [Huang Chen] has arrived in front of the filing cabinet.
0:28:11|0:28:16|Opening the cabinet, [Da Xiong] sat up in shock on the ground.
0:28:16|0:28:19|Suddenly, the alarm inside the research institute went off, and the alert sound rang out.
0:28:40|0:28:47|Here, the security has just arrived at the analysis room, while [Xia Tian] is anxiously waiting in the data room, with his hands clasped together in a starting position.
0:28:47|0:28:56|In the analysis room, a security guard questions [Huang Chen], who weakly shakes her head, but the security check detects information about [Xia Tian].
0:29:8|0:29:12|In the office, [Da Xiong] hears the name of [Xia Tian] and looks up.
0:29:12|0:29:15|And the security team captain has already arrived at the office of [Director].
0:29:15|0:29:17|[Director] stood up in surprise.
0:29:24|0:29:26|The same researcher died after being injected with PTX.
0:29:31|0:29:32|[Da Xiong] rushed to the data room.
0:29:53|0:29:56|[Xia Tian] was analyzing the data module when he was stopped by [Da Xiong].
0:30:30|0:30:34|Originally, [Da Xiong] protected [Xia Tian] and hid in the recess of a pillar.
0:30:47|0:30:55|[Da Xiong] tightly held onto [Xia Tian]'s arm, deep in thought. Suddenly, his gaze shifted to the ventilation duct at his feet, while the security outside seemed to have noticed something.
0:30:56|0:31:3|He took two steps and said to the subordinate searching over there.
0:31:3|0:31:15|A security guard turned and walked to the door, which automatically opened. He walked in with a gun and saw someone take two quick steps back, while [Da Xiong] raised his hands and asked in return.
0:31:25|0:31:32|[Xia Tian] is squatting at the ventilation duct with a data module in hand, moving along the duct to the other end.
0:31:32|0:31:36|[Xia Tian] jumped down from the ventilation duct and fell sitting on the ground.
0:31:36|0:31:45|Leaving the research institute, one must pass through the lobby, where security guards are evacuating the crowd at the elevator entrance.
0:31:45|0:31:49|[Xia Tian] ran towards the elevator on her floor, but ran into two security guards.
0:31:53|0:32:20|[Xia Tian] tightly held the data module in his arms, while two security guards suddenly got shot and fell to the ground. [Xia Tian] anxiously looked at the two on the ground, then slightly turned his head to see the security guards in the hall behind him already prepared with guns. However, on the display screen at the elevator entrance, [Xia Tian] saw the security guards waiting for him, and looking at the samples left on the cart in front of him gave him an idea. He pushed the cart and pressed the elevator button.
0:32:23|0:32:28|The man in the suit who just helped out is hiding in the back, reporting on Xia Tian's whereabouts.
0:32:28|0:32:40|[Xia Tian], who entered the elevator, took out a bottle from the cart drawer, opened it and poured the powder into the basin. Then, she unscrewed the cap of the liquid bottle and poured it in, causing a chemical reaction that quickly produced white mist.
0:32:40|0:32:47|[Xia Tian] covered his mouth and nose with his arm, fanned himself, and continued to add medicine inside. The head of security team looked at his actions with confusion.
0:33:15|0:33:19|The sudden explosion, the cold white ash, [Xia Tian] took the opportunity to run out of the elevator.
0:33:29|0:33:34|[Xia Tian] ran out of the hall and finally found a door in the corridor that was not locked.
0:33:34|0:33:41|He immediately pushed open the door and ran out, the security guards who caught up looked at the empty corridor, clasped their hands together and split up to search ahead.
0:33:41|0:33:46|And at this moment, [Xia Tian] had already climbed onto a protruding triangular peak outside.
0:33:46|0:33:52|He is climbing up the ladder, and after reaching the top, [Xia Tian] observes the security of the corridor.
0:33:52|0:33:55|The security guard quickly turned around and pulled back.
0:33:55|0:34:0|After confirming the security guard had passed, he climbed up the narrow rooftop and carefully made his way towards the garbage chute.
0:34:2|0:34:9|One slip of the foot scared him, causing him to quickly crouch down. After stabilizing himself, he covered his chest, took a deep breath, and then continued walking forward.
0:34:9|0:34:17|Upon reaching the processing port, he slid down sideways, but did not stop at the window above the processing port, instead sliding into the processing pipeline.
0:34:17|0:34:24|With a huge impact, he turned his head and used his arms to block the garbage, all the pipes leading to the central shredder.
0:34:24|0:34:25|[Xia Tian] just emerged from the pipe.
0:34:25|0:34:28|Quickly reached out to grab the nearby scroll wheel.
0:34:28|0:34:30|After sliding for a short distance, he finally caught the wheel.
0:34:31|0:34:35|The data module in hand slipped and rolled away.
0:34:35|0:34:41|[Xia Tian] watched as the data module stopped on the table less than half a meter away, while [Xue Du] continued to shovel garbage down.
0:34:41|0:34:47|She clung to the iron pipe between the rollers, using all four limbs to move towards the top of the data module on the opposite side.
0:34:47|0:34:53|[Xia Luo] moved slowly in a difficult posture, with constantly rolling garbage bags around, adding to the danger.
0:34:53|0:34:56|Looking up, a bag of garbage flew towards [Xia Tian].
0:34:57|0:35:2|[Xia Luo] was hit head-on and, propelled by the garbage, slid in headfirst.
0:35:2|0:35:8|As he approached the stage, his hand tightly grabbed the wheel, and the tip of the ruler was suddenly nailed in front of him.
0:35:8|0:35:17|He took a deep breath, switched to his left hand to grab the scroll wheel, and used his right hand closer to grab the data module. Once he got closer, he would be hit by the sharp ruler.
0:35:17|0:35:21|[Xia Tian] disregarded everything and steadily climbed towards the data module.
0:35:21|0:35:24|[Xia Tian] leaned over, the veins on his hands bulging.
0:35:25|0:35:36|Finally, [Xia Tian] grabbed the data module, his left hand still holding the scroll wheel. He turned over to the screen next to him to catch his breath, while not far away, someone was still persistently shoveling garbage.
0:35:38|0:35:55|On the other side of the research institute, [Cui Hu] and others were waiting. [Dou Dou] sat on the slanted back of the car, with a woman holding a gun in front. [Cui Hu] glanced at the time on his watch, showing one minute left. He turned to look at [Dou Dou], who stood up involuntarily. [Cui Hu] then turned around and walked towards him.
0:35:55|0:35:57|Bending down and holding his head, [Xia Tian] asked,
0:36:14|0:36:18|[Cui Hu] kissed [Dou Dou] and patted his head.
0:36:18|0:36:20|At this moment, [Xia Tian] is driving to the scene.
0:36:20|0:36:23|As he approached, his men raised their guns and moved closer.
0:36:23|0:36:26|[Xia Tian] opened the car door and rushed out, but was stopped by his men.
0:36:28|0:36:31|The woman's henchman restrains [Dou Dou], while [Xia Tian] shouts loudly.
0:36:48|0:37:2|A technician took the data module from Xia Tian's hand and placed it into the detector, then brought it to show Cui Hu, while Xia Tian loudly comforted Dou Dou.
0:37:2|0:37:13|[Cui Hu] took out the data module and gestured for the woman to release [Dou Dou].
0:37:13|0:37:14|[Xia Tian] tightly embraces [Dou Dou].
0:37:22|0:37:25|[Dou Dou]'s neck lit up, and [Xia Tian] looked at [Cui Hu].
0:37:31|0:37:35|[Cui Hu] looked at him, turned around, and took a pen-shaped button.
0:37:35|0:37:37|[Xia Tian] asked nervously.
0:37:44|0:37:51|[Cui Hu] did not respond, but instead leaned in to show the button to [Xia Tian], then straightened the circle, with his thumb gradually approaching the button.
0:37:51|0:37:57|[Xia Tian] nervously hugged [Dou Dou], and with [Cui Hu]'s press, a series of explosions sounded from the research institute across the river.
0:38:24|0:38:34|Speak up, the villager pressed the button on the handle, [Xia Tian] touched the glowing spot on [Dou Dou]'s neck.
0:38:34|0:38:40|[Xia Tian] rubbed and covered, but couldn't make the timer stop.
0:38:40|0:38:46|As the timer stops, [Dou Dou] tilts his head back, and [Xia Tian] drags him by the back, pulling him tightly into her arms.
0:39:0|0:39:5|Two thugs approached, grabbing Xia Tian's arms and forcibly pulling the two apart.
0:39:5|0:39:11|[Xia Luo] who was dragged away howled in despair, his legs kicking forcefully towards [Dou Dou].
0:39:11|0:39:16|Unfortunately, Xia Tian found that his strength was still too weak, and in the end, he was mercilessly dragged into a commercial vehicle.
0:39:17|0:39:27|While [Dou Dou] was picked up by a henchman and thrown into the truck, [Xia Tian], who was being pulled into the car, was trying to escape by digging at the window. However, two thugs held his wrists on both sides.
0:39:36|0:39:39|[Xia Tian] couldn't open one hand and reached towards [Cui Hu]'s head.
0:39:42|0:39:49|The two thugs promptly pulled back [Xia Luo], once again restraining him and pressing his head against the central armrest.
0:39:49|0:39:51|[Cui Hu] grabs [Xia Tian]'s hair.
0:40:11|0:40:17|[Xia Tian]'s eyes dimmed, and after [Cui Hu] gained his approval, he lifted the corners of his mouth and released the hand he was holding down.
0:40:17|0:40:23|At that moment, [Xia Tian]'s eyes rolled and she suddenly burst into tears, grabbing onto the driver's car bumper.
0:40:23|0:40:27|The car suddenly went out of control, causing several people to be frightened and lean forward.
0:40:27|0:40:33|The car drove calmly on the loop, with one person on the left and one on the right, and the driver had to carefully control [Xia Tian].
0:40:33|0:40:36|The car drove around the loop, moving forward from left to right.
0:40:37|0:40:47|Suddenly, [Xia Tian] pushed the gear lever all the way forward, shifting the car into the highest gear, and the car veered off the road, flipping over.
0:40:47|0:40:54|After a few somersaults, the car flipped over and stopped halfway up the mountain, with [Da Xiong] and [Cui Hu] covered in blood, unconscious.
0:40:54|0:41:0|And [Xia Tian] lay in the middle position, he opened his eyes and climbed out of the carriage from the body of Cui Hu.
0:41:5|0:41:10|His lower body still not fully out, he weakly flipped over and lay on the ground.
0:41:10|0:41:15|He gasped for breath, his eyes vacant, closed his eyes tightly for a moment, trying to regain his composure.
0:41:15|0:41:22|When he opened his eyes again, a spacecraft flew overhead, and his thoughts were instantly brought back to the past.
0:41:22|0:41:28|At that time, [Xia Tian] was camping on the mountain with [Dou Dou], and the snow on the mountain had not completely melted yet.
0:41:28|0:41:32|He squatted on the ground and controlled the aircraft to take off, with [Dou Dou] standing beside him watching.
0:41:33|0:41:37|The aircraft flew out of the hill, [Xia Tian] said to [Dou Dou].
0:41:42|0:41:50|[Dou Dou] pressed the confirm button, and the aircraft sprayed catalyst around, causing dark clouds to gather and then it started to rain. [Dou Dou] cheered.
0:41:52|0:41:57|[Xia Tian] covered the sun with one hand, watching the rainbow appear at the pavilion, [Dou Dou] exclaimed again.
0:42:10|0:42:30|Remembering that the mother and son finished the Rainbow Warrior's signature move, [Xia Tian] decided to rush back to the research institute. However, [Xia Tian] went in the opposite direction, his footsteps bright and clear. Suddenly, another explosion struck, smoke and dust billowed, [Xia Tian] fell to the ground, quickly covering his head. Then he got up and took a few steps.
0:42:30|0:42:39|Just as the statue in front of them was about to fall, [Xia Tian] quickly stepped back. Fortunately, after the statue fell, it leaned against the pillar diagonally in front.
0:42:39|0:42:44|[Xia Tian] ran a distance, but the statue still crashed into the pillar and fell completely to the ground.
0:42:44|0:42:49|In the office, sparks flew as the wires broke and [Xia Tian] held her head in her hands.
0:42:49|0:43:0|Walking quickly inside, another explosion came from the room next to them. [Xia Tian] was pushed by the huge pressure towards the glass on the side, causing cracks to appear as their head directly hit the glass, and they fell to the ground.
0:43:0|0:43:12|Lying on the ground, [Xia Tian] propped himself up with one hand, lifted his head in pain, but then fell back weakly, his left hand covering his right elbow. After a short while, he managed to stand up, pushed open the office door, and finally left.
0:43:35|0:43:37|[Da Xiong] looked at [Xia Tian], who was covered in injuries.
0:43:38|0:43:43|[Xia Tian] stood still and walked to the control panel, using his arm to wipe away the dust.
0:44:38|0:44:51|The explosion of the fish body shattered the glass of the operator. [Xia Tian], who had completed the change of clothes, has entered the teleportation room. She clicked on the particle reorganization on the internal screen, then clicked confirm, and the reorganization was ready to start loading.
0:44:51|0:45:11|After the loading is complete, [Xia Tian] takes a step back, lifts his head, and looks inside the familiar yet unfamiliar teleporter. Outside, [Da Xiong], who was knocked down by the explosion, stands up and looks at [Xia Tian] inside the teleporter. The components inside the teleporter start to operate, [Xia Tian] feels the vibration, looks down at his feet, and hears [Da Xiong]'s voice.
0:45:11|0:45:17|[Xia Tian] looked at [Da Xiong] outside, although he was panting, his eyes were still determined. The iron cover and petal cover under his feet opened.
0:45:18|0:45:35|[Xia Tian] took a small step back and looked down through the glass cover. From here, you could see that the teleporter was very high, with each level of the central research institute designed as instruments, gradually shrinking towards the top and bottom. [Xia Tian] looked at the teleporter beneath her feet, like an abyss with no bottom.
0:45:36|0:45:40|With his face covered in scars, he took another small step and stood back in the center.
0:45:40|0:45:43|He raised his eyes and clenched his fists. 
0:45:43|0:45:47|As the glass cover opens, [Xia Tian] falls down completely.
0:45:47|0:45:53|Under the influence of gravity, he somersaulted, with his head down, passing through the layers inside the teleporter.
0:45:53|0:45:58|As he fell, the top of the teleporter at the research institute was spinning rapidly.
0:45:59|0:46:4|As the fall height increased, [Xia Tian] raised his arms to resist some of the impact.
0:46:4|0:46:16|Arriving at the bottom, the center appeared like a water surface, with a bright light shining in the middle. [Xia Tian] passed through here, as if entering another world, surrounded only by smoke and reflected light.
0:46:16|0:46:20|And [Xia Tian], who lost gravity, slowly flips in mid-air.
0:46:20|0:46:35|Slowly, the clothing made of special material began to transform into particles, followed by [Xia Tian]'s skin also starting to disperse into particles, until [Xia Tian] completely turned into particles, slowly dissipating in the space.
0:46:35|0:46:45|During this process, everything started to rewind, and the files that exploded in the explosion all returned to their original state. [Xia Tian], who rushed back to the research institute, went from moving forward to moving backward.
0:46:46|0:46:59|The fallen statue stood up, the car rolling down the hill returned to the road, and [Dou Dou], who was thrown into the truck, also returned to the hands of the person in the car. An Bao was waiting for [Xia Tian] at the elevator entrance.
0:47:1|0:47:20|Time goes back to one hour and fifty minutes ago, [Da Xiong] is in the office of the teleportation room, looking at the data. He picks up a folder from the shelf next to him and spreads it out, then takes another pair of observation glasses and puts them on. At this moment, a prompt box pops up on the screen in front of him. He takes off the observation glasses again, and the screen shows the machine is operating.
0:47:20|0:47:28|Behind him came another movement, he turned back in confusion, looking at the teleporter, [Da Xiong] turned his seat around, put down the observation glasses in his hand, stood up, a person?
0:48:19|0:48:31|[Da Xiong] ran to help [Xia Tian] get her clothes, but inside the teleportation room, [Xia Tian] covered her head. She furrowed her brows, trying to stand up, leaning against the door frame of the teleporter. Just as she walked out, she covered her head again, almost unable to stand, and fell backwards.
0:48:31|0:48:38|Fortunately, leaning against the door frame to support herself, before long, [Xia Tian] came out dressed and [Da Xiong] was full of questions.
0:48:49|0:49:7|[Da Xiong] opened his mouth in surprise, while [Xia Tian] didn't bother to explain further and dialed the phone. After a few rings, a voice from the east came through.
0:49:15|0:49:19|Da Xiong and Huang Chen happened to take the elevator up.
0:49:35|0:49:49|In the analysis room, a bottle of medicine fell from the shelf. Xia Tian heard the sound and turned around, bending down to pick up the bottle. Just as she was about to put it back on the shelf, a hand suddenly reached out from the other side and tightly grabbed Xia Tian's collar.
0:49:49|0:49:53|Xiang Dong had no time to react before a needle was inserted into his neck.
0:49:54|0:50:1|Xiang Dong was injected with PTX serum, his head quickly flushed with blood, gradually losing strength, and fell down.
0:50:1|0:50:8|[Xia Tian], who rushed to the analysis room, first looked up at the second floor and saw the man in a suit with blood on his hands standing up.
0:50:8|0:50:14|[Xia Tian] walked around to the observation platform for a better view, while the man in a suit walked down the stairs, adjusting his sleeves.
0:50:14|0:50:17|[Xia Tian] watched as the other party was about to walk to the first floor, and quickly hid behind a pillar.
0:50:17|0:50:24|After the man in the suit left, [Xia Tian] turned around, pondered for a moment, and secretly moistened the cotton cloth with the movie fan from the adjacent laboratory.
0:50:26|0:50:29|In the first time and space, [Xia Tian] is about to arrive at the analysis room.
0:50:29|0:50:34|Sure, indeed, the man in a suit who walked out of the analysis room met [Xia Tian] who had rushed back from the first time period.
0:50:34|0:50:39|He rushed to the second floor of the analysis room and was shocked by the body facing east, sitting on the ground.
0:50:39|0:50:44|In the second time and space, Xia Tian rushed up and covered his mouth with a cotton cloth when he turned around.
0:50:45|0:50:52|In the first timeline, [Xia Tian] struggled for a moment before losing consciousness, while in the second timeline, [Xia Tian] clenched her fists again.
0:50:52|0:51:4|In the second time and space, [Xia Tian] looked around, first placing the first time and space's [Xia Tian] on the ground, then picking up the eyeball pointing east and putting it in the pocket. At this moment, the phone in the pocket of the first time and space's [Xia Tian] started vibrating.
0:51:4|0:51:11|In the second time and space, [Xia Tian] took out his phone from his pocket, showing an unknown number, indicating it was [Cui Hu].
0:51:11|0:51:16|[Xia Tian] hung up the phone, then took out the gift that [Director] gave to [Dou Dou] from his pocket.
0:51:16|0:51:26|He took out the rainbow warrior watch from the bag, looked at it and put it on his wrist. Then he turned his head and noticed the enclosed cart next to the filing cabinet.
0:51:26|0:51:29|In the teleportation room, [Da Xiong] is checking data for [Huang Chen].
0:51:38|0:51:43|[Huang Chen] checks the data in the folder, while [Da Xiong] answers the phone.
0:51:49|0:51:56|[Da Xiong] looked towards the open elevator door and quickly used both hands to hold back [Huang Chen] who was about to turn around.
0:52:4|0:52:6|[Da Xiong] picks up the headphones and says.
0:52:17|0:52:32|He turned [Huang Chen]'s chair towards the screen and quickly went to deal with Xia Tian in the first time-space, while Xia Tian in the second time-space was rushing to the office of the Director, avoiding the collision with the cart that should have happened, but the person next to it couldn't catch up.
0:52:32|0:52:41|[Xia Tian] ran off with a yawn, entered the teleportation room, and after a quick glance, [Da Xiong] pulled the cart in. Unexpectedly, [Huang Chen] suddenly turned around and shouted.
0:52:45|0:52:52|Terrified, [Da Xiong] quickly sat on the nearby chair, with one arm resting on the cart, waving at [Huang Chen] to indicate him to turn his head.
0:52:53|0:52:57|Next, [Da Xiong] reported [Xia Tian] from the first time-space and put her in the wardrobe.
0:52:59|0:53:1|At the same time, outside the office of [Director].
0:53:24|0:53:32|[Director] watched him walk away, knowing full well that [Xia Tian] had smoothly entered the database, once again waiting for the data synthesis.
0:53:32|0:53:37|In a moment, he remembered [Dou Dou]'s cry for help, his fingers digging into the hair beside him.
0:53:43|0:53:48|After some thought, he tied up his hair and entered the room, [Da Xiong] took off [Huang Chen]'s headphones.
0:54:1|0:54:15|In the database, the data has been synthesized, [Xia Tian] picks up the data module and leaves. Inside the analysis room, [Huang Chen] notices that the second floor is empty, so she tries to put down the data first. However, after entering the file cabinet password, it shows an error and the cabinet cannot be opened.
0:54:15|0:54:19|He was surprised for a moment, put down the folder, entered the password again, and used both hands to pull open the cabinet door.
0:55:4|0:55:5|The scene cuts back to the analysis room.
0:55:8|0:55:15|The repairman fixed it and opened the cabinet door, Huang Chen peered inside.
0:55:27|0:55:29|[Director] stood up.
0:55:31|0:55:36|At this time, Xia Tian has already driven to the parking lot on the opposite bank.
0:55:47|0:55:55|Cui Hu's subordinate Wen Sheng hurried over, while Xia Tian quickly entered a kill code and held up the hand with the data above the water surface.
0:55:56|0:56:1|[Cui Hu] hurried over, [Xia Tian] tightly grasped the data card, staring at [Cui Hu].
0:56:5|0:56:8|His fingers gradually loosened, then clenched tightly again.
0:56:8|0:56:12|[Cui Hu] thought for a moment, then turned to the henchmen behind him and said.
0:56:13|0:56:23|The gun of the female henchman aiming at [Dou Dou]'s neck, and the bomb was sucked out.
0:56:25|0:56:29|[Dou Dou], who was running past, was grabbed by [Cui Hu] by the hat and pulled aside.
0:56:29|0:56:37|[Xia Tian] understood his intention, took a step forward and squatted down, slowly placing the data module on the ground.
0:56:37|0:56:42|Seeing this, [Cui Hu] had a disdainful expression on his face, then let go of [Dou Dou].
0:56:43|0:56:47|At that moment, [Cui Hu] and [Xia Tian] both drew their pistols.
0:56:47|0:56:49|Xia Tian's gun is aimed at the data module.
0:56:52|0:56:55|The two sides confronted each other, with [Dou Dou] running over to hug [Xia Tian].
0:56:59|0:57:2|[Dou Dou] ran towards the side of the car after hearing the words.
0:57:2|0:57:5|[Cui Hu] looked at [Xia Tian] in front of him and smiled with his head tilted.
0:57:5|0:57:10|[Xia Tian] took a deep breath, took a step back, and the other person followed with a step forward.
0:57:10|0:57:11|[Xia Tian] shouted
0:57:14|0:57:18|Sun Hu put away his gun and said to his subordinates,
0:57:18|0:57:23|[Xia Tian] glanced at the car and saw that [Dou Dou] was already seated, so he slowly backed away.
0:57:23|0:57:26|The technician walked up with a box, but was stopped by [Xia Tian] pointing a gun at him.
0:57:28|0:57:34|[Cui Hu] opened his arms to signal everyone, then raised his gun.
0:57:40|0:57:42|[Cui Hu] shouted loudly.
0:57:42|0:57:47|The henchmen ran back to the car one after another, while the technician sat on the ground checking the data module.
0:57:47|0:57:49|[Cui Hu] walked towards him, and the technician raised his hand and said
0:57:49|0:57:58|[Cui Hu] listened, furrowed his brow and looked up. After checking the database in the research institute, the researcher said to [Director].
0:57:58|0:58:10|The security team leader walked forward, [Director] turned around with arms crossed, everyone was very puzzled, while [Xia Tian] on the other side was driving and comforting [Dou Dou].
0:58:16|0:58:21|The fierce impact scared [Dou Dou] from sitting behind [Xia Tian] to sitting directly behind.
0:58:21|0:58:22|[Cui Hu] arranged his subordinates.
0:58:29|0:58:47|Suddenly, [Xia Tian] sharply turned the steering wheel, with [Cui Hu] and others in hot pursuit. Several cars drove into the border defense area of the container yard. [Xia Tian] tried to turn around among the piles of containers, but ran into a forklift carrying boxes. Due to the high driving speed, there was no time to dodge.
0:58:47|0:58:52|Still frowning at the door and brakes, but still hit it, [Dou Dou] hugged the seat and vomited.
0:58:52|0:59:6|Soon, [Cui Hu] and the others' two cars caught up with [Xia Tian], one following behind and one pulling up alongside. The car on the side suddenly swerved towards [Xia Tian], causing her car to almost collide with the central divider. Inside the car, [Xia Tian] and [Dou Dou] were moving violently.
0:59:6|0:59:19|The vehicles on the side continued to squeeze over, and [Xia Tian]'s car scraped against the assembly box as it moved forward. It looked like it was about to hit the box in front, so [Xia Tian] quickly squeezed out and turned the steering wheel, only to find a pile of wooden boxes filled with goods next to it.
0:59:19|0:59:23|After crashing into these wooden boxes, [Xia Tian]'s face also hit the steering wheel.
0:59:23|0:59:30|The gunman behind got off the car, [Xia Tian] held his head and touched the corner of his mouth, glancing back.
0:59:30|0:59:32|[Xia Tian] adjusts the gear and reverses the car.
0:59:38|0:59:50|[Xia Tian] slams into the container at an angle, then jerks back with [Dou Dou], but [Xia Tian] quickly starts the car again and drives forward. The henchmen with the knitted hat quickly dodge and jump into the car with the door open, while the others quickly get in the car to continue the chase.
0:59:52|0:59:58|[Xia Tian] glanced at the situation of the control mirror, but didn't notice that a container was being lowered by a container handler in front.
0:59:58|1:0:11|When [Xia Tian] noticed it, he could only close his eyes tightly and step on the gas pedal, driving down the ramp covered with wooden boards. The container was placed at the same height, just sandwiching the rear of [Xia Tian]'s car, slowly lifting the entire car.
1:0:11|1:0:18|At this moment, the henchmen in the car behind also drove forward, but they didn't have time to brake, and crashed diagonally into the container. Another car followed closely behind.
1:0:19|1:0:27|The handle on the side of the container that was heavily impacted rattled, one end slammed straight towards the ground, while the other end was about to come loose.
1:0:27|1:0:36|[Dou Dou] tightly grasped the handle behind the driver's seat, while [Xia Tian] stepped on the gas pedal and rammed the wooden box. Through the rear window, [Dou Dou] could see the container about to come down.
1:0:36|1:0:45|At a critical moment, the wooden box was pushed open, and the container fell behind the car. However, obviously, this rescue attempt was not successful, and [Xia Tian] once again returned to the teleporter.
1:0:46|1:0:53|In the teleporter, [Xia Tian] looked pale, furrowed his brow, opened his eyes, and in addition to pain, there was deep hatred in his eyes.
1:0:53|1:1:3|He tried to sit up with his arms, but due to the pain, he lowered his head again. After struggling to sit up again, Xia Tian, who was kneeling on the ground, lowered his head in pain.
1:1:3|1:1:9|[Da Xiong] ran over at the sound, only to see [Xia Tian] standing up with her hands propping open the door of the transporter, her eyes turning fierce.
1:1:10|1:1:17|In my mind, the face of [Cui Hu] from the second spacetime appeared, with one hand gripping the steering wheel and the other hand holding a gun.
1:1:17|1:1:29|Thinking of this, [Xia Tian] glanced sideways, propping up his chin, while [Cui Hu] pulled the trigger, the bullet shot out, shattering the front windshield of the second time-space [Xia Tian], heading straight towards the back seat where [Dou Dou] was sitting.
1:1:29|1:1:38|[Dou Dou]'s right chest was hit by a bullet, blood splattered out from the back, and the person fell backwards due to the impact, while [Xia Tian] opened his mouth and turned towards the back.
1:1:39|1:1:43|Remembering this, [Xia Tian] in the Third Space is already filled with hatred.
1:1:43|1:1:47|In the memory, [Cui Hu] tilted his head, looking ahead with no expression on his face.
1:1:47|1:1:53|In the second spacetime, [Xia Tian] unbuckles the seatbelt and calls out to [Dou Dou], who has already fallen in the back seat.
1:1:53|1:2:3|In the third dimension, [Da Xiong] asked anxiously, grabbing his arm.
1:2:9|1:2:12|[Xia Tian] actually pressed [Da Xiong] against the wall by his neck.
1:2:17|1:2:20|[Xia Tian] still firmly grasped [Da Xiong] and said.
1:2:28|1:2:36|After speaking, [Xia Tian] turned and walked away, with [Da Xiong] calling out to him, "Xia Tian, don't take any more risks, don't kill me!"
1:2:40|1:2:47|[Xia Tian] knocked over the cart, turned and walked into the elevator, while [Da Xiong] lowered his head and then looked at [Xia Tian].
1:2:47|1:2:51|The scene shifts to the data center, where the security team captain says to [the director],
1:3:0|1:3:18|The elevator door opens, a security guard walks in, but the [Director] notices [Xia Tian] on the elevator monitor. The security guard reports, and the security team leader says to the [Director] who has caught sight of [Xia Tian].
1:3:21|1:3:24|At this moment, [Xia Tian] from the Third Space-Time is driving a car and talking on the phone.
1:3:24|1:3:28|In the second time and space, [Xia Tian] picks up the phone.
1:3:40|1:3:56|In the third spacetime, [Xia Tian] did not answer, hung up the phone, his face only showing calmness. On the overpass, [Cui Hu] was driving, aiming the wrist handle at the screen, and the location appeared on the screen. He looked up into the distance, then followed the direction indicated by the location, turning into the underground passage at the loop.
1:3:56|1:3:59|Xia Tian from the second time-space was stopped on the small path under the Guangxia Cloud Terrace.
1:3:59|1:4:6|In the second time and space, [Xia Tian] watched the running vehicle's position, and realized that the other party had no intention of stopping the vehicle after getting off.
1:4:9|1:4:13|Dou Dou stood up in confusion, but at that moment, Cui Hu pulled out a handgun.
1:4:13|1:4:20|In the second time and space, Dou Dou was shot in the front and appeared in the mind falling in the third time and space.
1:4:20|1:4:24|Thinking of these, he actually turned the steering wheel from the loop and crashed into his own abdomen.
1:4:49|1:4:54|In his arms, [Dou Dou] was still watching the car that had crashed into them, while in the second timeline, [Xia Tian] was running and looking back.
1:4:54|1:5:0|In the third dimension, [Xia Tian] had his head buried in the airbag, trying hard to wake himself up.
1:5:0|1:5:4|Cui Hu, who got off the car at the last moment, was the first to get up from the ground.
1:5:4|1:5:6|He supported the car and looked into the car seat.
1:5:6|1:5:11|In the third spacetime, [Xia Tian] turned to look at the second spacetime's [Xia Tian] who was leaving with [Dou Dou].
1:5:11|1:5:14|Finally, they decided to chase after the two who were running away.
1:5:15|1:5:21|Xiangyan ran back and forth under the overpass, with [Xia Tian] pulling [Dou Dou] around a pillar and stopping at the roadside.
1:5:21|1:5:27|When [Cui Hu] caught up, all that could be seen was the desolate grassland of Xiaolitang, with no sign of Xia Tian and Mu Jing.
1:5:27|1:5:31|Then [Cui Hu] glanced at his watch, smiled slightly, and ran forward.
1:5:31|1:5:34|[Xia Tian], who stayed in the third time and space, finally woke up.
1:5:35|1:5:41|He pushed open the car door and got out, the three of them had disappeared without a trace, but he noticed the gun left by [Cui Hu] on the passenger seat.
1:5:41|1:5:46|At this moment, [Xia Tian] from the second time-space, ran into an abandoned school with [Dou Dou].
1:5:50|1:5:56|[Dou Dou] slipped on the ground, and [Xia Tian] from the second time-space pulled her up and ran up the stairs with her.
1:5:56|1:6:2|In the abandoned school, there were iron scaffolds everywhere. The two ran inside and found a hidden room.
1:6:2|1:6:5|[Xia Tian] picks up [Dou Dou] and places him on the table, then bends over with both hands on the table.
1:6:5|1:6:10|After speaking, she hugged [Dou Dou] again.
1:6:37|1:6:38|She looked down at her wrist.
1:6:46|1:6:49|Footsteps could be heard coming from the stairs, and she looked to the side.
1:6:49|1:6:54|She looked down through the broken window and saw [Cui Hu] walking up the stairs.
1:6:56|1:7:3|While she was puzzled, [Dou Dou] played with the rainbow watch in her hand. Just as she was about to happily put it on, she noticed that something was not quite right.
1:7:10|1:7:15|[Xia Tian] from the Second Space-time walked over to take the watch and looked at [Dou Dou] inquiringly.
1:7:17|1:7:21|He looked at his watch again, then squatted down and smashed the back cover of the watch.
1:7:21|1:7:26|After picking it up, they unexpectedly found a shining part inside the watch.
1:7:26|1:7:30|After turning around for a while, he finally understood.
1:7:32|1:7:39|He lifted his head and turned his eyes, unable to believe it, and weakly dropped his hand.
1:7:39|1:7:42|In the research institute, the [Director] looks at [Xia Tian] in the first time and space.
1:8:20|1:8:25|The research institute is about to explode, we must hurry and back up all the data.
1:8:36|1:8:49|[Da Xiong] let go of [Xia Tian]'s hand, watching the two of them leave. Inside the abandoned school, [Cui Hu] walked up.
1:8:49|1:9:11|Ending the intercom, [Cui Hu] glanced at his watch, then lifted his head, a smile forming at the corner of his mouth. Upstairs, the dismantled watch was placed on the table. [Cui Hu] pushed open the door and walked in. Finding no one, he looked at his wrist, then walked to the table. In the second time-space, [Xia Tian] and [Dou Dou] were hiding nearby, watching him.
1:9:16|1:9:36|[Cui Hu] was looking at the watch on the table. Suddenly, there was a noise behind him. His right foot was caught by a rope, causing him to twist towards the ground. In the next room, [Da Xiong] and [Dou Dou] were pushing a piano. Despite [Cui Hu]'s struggles, the piano was already pushed aside, and [Cui Hu] ended up hanging on the edge of the cabinet.
1:9:39|1:9:48|[Xia Tian] and [Dou Dou] pushed the piano with all their strength, and as the window glass shattered, the piano fell out. In the end, the whole person was lifted up and leaned against the wall.
1:9:48|1:9:56|[Xia Tian] from the Third Time Space, who rushed over, happened to see the piano being pushed out of the window. Holding a gun, he quickly ran towards the building, his face filled with worry.
1:9:57|1:10:14|Abandoned school project, [Cui Hu] is still struggling. In the second time-space, [Xia Tian] runs out of the room holding [Dou Dou], while [Cui Hu] hangs upside down with arms crossed. After a pause, he pulls out the forgotten dagger, hangs upside down with a bent waist, hands gripping his legs and pushing upwards, tries to make a cut with the dagger, but fails.
1:10:14|1:10:25|At this moment, in the second timeline, [Xia Tian] ran up the stairs with [Dou Dou], while [Cui Hu] paused again, pressing the tip of the dagger against the wall, bending over and arching upwards. This time, he failed to complete the task.
1:10:28|1:10:35|With the piano falling outside the window, [Cui Hu] fell onto the storage cabinet and then onto the ground, gasping for breath as he lay on the floor.
1:10:35|1:10:45|In the corridor, [Xia Tian] from the Second Time-Space pulled [Dou Dou] and ran downstairs, followed by [Cui Hu] who caught up and kicked the fire glass in the stairs, taking out an axe.
1:11:3|1:11:27|While walking, smashing the locker, then peeking inside, he smiled, raised his index finger, took a few steps, and then smashed the locker with an axe again. In the second time and space, [Xia Tian] tightly hugged [Dou Dou] in the locker without making a sound, while [Cui Hu] paused, listening carefully, as if he had a direction.
1:11:27|1:11:29|[Xia Tian] is preparing to peek through the crack to see what's going on.
1:11:32|1:11:44|Perhaps thinking that Village Tiger's axe came crashing in directly, he struck twice more fiercely. The crack that was smashed this time wasn't big enough, so he reached in and grabbed [Dou Dou] by the collar. [Dou Dou] struggled in fear.
1:11:44|1:11:53|[Xia Tian] pushed the cabinet door hard, causing it to swing towards the opposite side and trapping Cui Hu's hand.
1:12:3|1:12:4|Xia Tian's wrist was smashed and dislocated.
1:12:17|1:12:33|Dou Dou ran away crying, Cui Hu grabbed Xia Tian's collar and strangled him, but released his hand before he suffocated, throwing him to the ground. Xia Tian, lying on the ground, crawled forward. Seeing Xia Tian in this state, Cui Hu, weakened, bent down to pull him up, but unexpectedly,
1:12:34|1:12:38|[Xia Tian] grabbed the wood chips on the ground and tossed them towards himself.
1:12:38|1:12:42|Cui Hu quickly blocked with his arm, but five eyes were still left on the ground.
1:12:42|1:12:49|[Xia Tian] took this opportunity to run, jumping from one level of the construction scaffolding to another. [Cui Hu] reached out and chased after him skillfully.
1:12:49|1:12:53|[Xia Tian] looked back while running, only to notice that [Cui Hu] was nowhere to be seen.
1:12:53|1:12:59|Cui Hu watched as Xia Tian slowly approached through the wide cloth, while Xia Tian was still clinging to the pole and looking up.
1:12:59|1:13:7|Suddenly, Cui Hu grabbed Xia Tian's foot from below, holding onto the pole and shaking the armor hard, reaching out his arm to grab him.
1:13:9|1:13:26|One brother hung on the iron bar and turned outward, while the other hand tightly grabbed the iron bar. As the body swung over, the foot slowly touched the iron bar below, [Cui Hu] grabbed his ankle again. He kicked hard, [Cui Hu] let go of his hand, but the other hand firmly held onto the iron bar, and the two climbed up, one high and one low.
1:13:26|1:13:32|[Xia Tian] climbed up one level and flipped in, running to the side, but was grabbed by the neck by [Cui Hu] who climbed up.
1:13:33|1:13:41|Watching [Xia Tian] being choked and coughing, he released his hand and pushed her to the ground. [Xia Tian], who fell to the ground, tried to crawl forward, but her leg was stepped on by [Cui Hu].
1:13:41|1:13:51|[Xia Tian] sat up, but pushed [Cui Hu]'s legs. [Cui Hu] grabbed his back collar and punched him repeatedly, four punches later, [Xia Tian] fell to the ground.
1:13:53|1:13:59|Dou Dou, who ran into the classroom crying, saw a data cable with a flashing light on the table and picked it up to take a look.
1:13:59|1:14:5|And [Cui Hu] has already dragged [Xia Tian] away from the construction scaffolding, throwing him onto the corridor.
1:14:5|1:14:6|Nose sighed and said.
1:14:12|1:14:17|At this moment, the third construction worker, [Xia Tian], arrived and fired a few shots, hitting the glass above [Cui Hu]'s head.
1:14:17|1:14:20|He picked up the glass on the ground and strangled the second construction worker [Xia Tian].
1:14:31|1:14:37|In the third spacetime, [Xia Tian] approached with a gun, while [Cui Hu] pressed a glass against the neck of the second spacetime [Xia Tian].
1:15:2|1:15:7|After speaking, [Xia Tian] pushed open the door to the second time-space, jumped to the side, and slid down along the banner.
1:15:8|1:15:16|After firing several shots, [Xia Tian] from the Third Space quickly dodged the bullets from Qianhu's men and crouched down next to [Xia Tian] from the Second Space.
1:15:27|1:15:31|Xia Tian from the second timeline and Da Xiong from the third timeline got off the car.
1:15:43|1:15:55|After speaking, he turned around and started shooting at Cui Hu's henchmen. In the second timeline, Xia Tian got up and ran towards the classroom, bullets hitting the handrail in the corridor. In the third timeline, Xia Tian dodged and fired back, retreating to the other side and flipping over.
1:16:4|1:16:9|In the second time and space, [Xia Tian] takes the data cable from [Dou Dou].
1:16:11|1:16:14|She rubbed [Dou Dou]'s hair, and [Dou Dou] pointed to his neck.
1:16:26|1:16:31|[Xia Tian] turned his head and looked around, his gaze falling on the escape pod by the window.
1:16:31|1:16:37|He then tied himself and [Dou Dou] together with a rope, with their feet against the wall, slowly moving towards the ground.
1:16:37|1:16:47|Before long, the two landed safely on the ground. Meanwhile, indoors, [Xia Tian] from the Third Space was shooting at the henchmen blowing fire across from her as she descended the stairs, but she got shot in the arm by them.
1:16:47|1:16:57|The four henchmen across from him intensified their attack, injured, he ran backwards, wanting to strike back, only to find that the gun in his hand was out of bullets.
1:16:57|1:17:1|Four henchmen ran over to search through a pile of debris when they saw him not moving.
1:17:1|1:17:3|A bald henchman sees a locker next to him.
1:17:9|1:17:16|Unexpectedly, the cabinet door opened and [Xia Tian] from the Third Space quickly attached a bomb to him, then closed the cabinet door.
1:17:16|1:17:26|The locker was blown open and rushed towards the first floor. In the third dimension, [Xia Tian] pushed open a corner of the burning locker, lay down for a moment, and then crawled out.
1:17:26|1:17:32|At this moment, in the second timeline, [Xia Tian] has already taken [Dou Dou] to the hospital and is pushing a hospital bed while making a phone call.
1:17:36|1:17:40|[Dou Dou] was pushed into the ward, and [Xia Tian] took a deep breath.
1:17:44|1:17:48|[Da Xiong] put down his phone blankly, suddenly remembered something, and looked towards the door.
1:17:48|1:17:51|Next, he ran into the database, and [Xia Tian] from the first spacetime turned around.
1:18:6|1:18:9|You actually... [Xia Tian] hurried over to [Da Xiong].
1:18:20|1:18:24|[Xia Tian], crouching on the ground, looked up at [Director].
1:18:28|1:18:31|[Da Xiong] had no reaction, [Xia Tian] looked at [Suo Zhang].
1:20:1|1:20:10|[Director] was lost in memories, with a family photo on the table and a written notice stating that he would step down as the head of the laboratory on November 1, 2025.
1:20:10|1:20:15|He picked up the medicine bottle on the table and was about to pour it all out when a hand holding a gun knocked the bottle off.
1:20:15|1:20:17|The director asked.
1:20:17|1:20:19|This person is [Cui Hu].
1:20:27|1:20:31|[Cui Hu] played with the medicine bottle, looked up at [Chief], and Chief continued speaking.
1:20:37|1:20:41|Hearing this, [Cui Hu] sat up straight, while [Captain] tilted his head and pointed fiercely.
1:20:55|1:20:58|The memories end, and the people in the research institute scatter in all directions.
1:20:58|1:21:1|[Cui Hu] came in and immediately took out a dagger to deal with a security guard.
1:21:1|1:21:4|He slowly raised his head, panting, and looked at the sculpture in the center.
1:21:4|1:21:11|The statue of the deity on the sculpture has huge wings, with hands crossed over the chest, as if also staring at [Cui Hu].
1:21:11|1:21:15|The data module in the database is completed and automatically cleared.
1:21:15|1:21:21|[Director] turned around and walked to the center of the control panel.
1:21:21|1:21:23|He turned his head and looked at [Xia Tian].
1:21:31|1:21:35|Speak up, [Chief] immediately pulled out a gun and aimed it at the first moment of the scare.
1:21:35|1:21:41|At this moment, [Cui Hu] walked in and threw the dagger directly, hitting the wrist of [Captain] who was holding the gun.
1:21:41|1:21:43|[Xia Tian] turned his head and looked at the fierce man.
1:21:43|1:21:47|[Cui Hu] also glanced at [Xia Tian] and walked up to the director.
1:21:47|1:21:51|[Captain] wanted to pick up the injured gun, but was caught by [Cui Hu] who snatched it away.
1:22:1|1:22:9|[Cui Hu] pulled the trigger as he spoke, then slowly lowered his hand and looked down at the director lying in a pool of blood, while on the other side, inside the hospital.
1:22:9|1:22:20|In the second time and space, [Xia Tian] touches [Dou Dou]'s face in front of the sickbed, looks up, and sees the data cable in the plate on the table. The scene returns to the database, [Cui Hu] walks towards [Xia Tian] in the first time and space.
1:22:48|1:22:53|[Xia Tian] was crying as he tried to come up with an excuse before dinner, but he was stopped by [Cui Hu] pointing a gun at his head.
1:22:53|1:23:3|[Xia Tian] could only cry weakly, while [Cui Hu] bent his arm and reached out to grab his clothes.
1:23:3|1:23:6|The gun is pointed at the chin of [Xia Tian] in the first time and space.
1:23:6|1:23:17|But upon hearing this, he also began to ponder. Suddenly, a figure of [Xia Tian] from a different time and space rushed out of the ventilation duct, and shot a gun at [Cui Hu] through the glass, hitting [Cui Hu]'s upper arm.
1:23:18|1:23:35|[Cui Hu] held the injured area and fired several shots. [Xia Tian] from the first timeline was scared and screamed while holding her head. [Xia Tian] from the third timeline used a pillar as cover, waited for a moment, and then counterattacked. [Cui Hu] hid inside the control panel, preparing to grab the receipt module first, but was shot by [Xia Tian] from the third timeline.
1:23:35|1:23:37|[Cui Hu]'s eyes suddenly turned fierce.
1:23:38|1:23:45|In the first timeline, [Xia Tian] sat on the steps watching as [Cui Hu] angrily approached the Xia Tian from the third timeline.
1:23:45|1:23:52|[Xia Tian] from the Third Space suddenly emerged from behind the pillar. Before he could fire, he was shot in the hand by [Cui Hu], causing the gun to fall out.
1:23:52|1:23:58|When [Xia Tian] rushed towards the steps, [Cui Hu] from the first timeline threw himself at [Cui Hu]'s legs and lifted him up.
1:23:58|1:24:2|In the Third Space-Time, [Xia Tian] took the opportunity to rush up and firmly held onto the injured upper arm of [Cui Hu].
1:24:3|1:24:21|Blood gushed out, [Cui Hu] grabbed [Xia Tian] from the third time-space and pushed him down. However, he picked up the dagger on the ground, just as [Xia Tian] from the first time-space strangled [Cui Hu] from behind. The [Xia Tian] from the third time-space stepped forward and stabbed [Cui Hu] in the chest with a knife, while his other hand tightly gripped his neck. [Cui Hu]'s face began to swell due to congestion.
1:24:22|1:24:25|And in the third dimension, [Xia Tian] just stared coldly at [Cui Hu].
1:24:25|1:24:29|In the first time and space, [Xia Tian] was so scared by the situation that she let go of her hand and kept backing away.
1:24:29|1:24:32|In the Third Space, [Xia Tian] is still exerting force with his hands.
1:24:32|1:24:35|Gradually, the gun in [Cui Hu]'s hand slipped to the ground.
1:24:35|1:24:38|And in the third dimension, [Xia Tian] also let go of the hand.
1:24:38|1:24:41|[Cui Hu] covered his wound and sat leaning against the data table.
1:24:41|1:24:45|In the hospital, [Xia Tian] from the second time-space finds a computer that can analyze data.
1:24:49|1:24:51|Half a year ago.
1:25:5|1:25:8|[Cui Hu] is lost in memories, with a data cable implanted into his forehead.
1:25:8|1:25:19|At that moment, in the second time-space of the hospital, [Xia Tian] plugged the data cable into the computer, and a foreigner appeared on the screen, saying that the experimental recording device had been implanted in your body.
1:25:46|1:25:50|In the second time and space, Xia Tian listens as the person on the screen speaks to Cui Hu.
1:26:5|1:26:8|Before leaving the computer, the nurse asked [Xia Tian] from the Second Time Space.
1:26:16|1:26:21|[Xia Tian] took the pen, but noticed the spots on his hand.
1:26:23|1:26:28|After the nurse left, she rolled up her sleeves and indeed, there were many spots on her arms.
1:26:28|1:26:30|She remembered what Dong said.
1:27:6|1:27:11|In the third dimension, [Xia Tian] looks at the first dimension's [Xia Tian] with a tilted head.
1:27:43|1:27:48|The explosion went off, Xia Tian from the first timeline took the opportunity to push the Xia Tian from the third timeline.
1:27:48|1:27:54|In the Third Space-Time, [Xia Tian] quickly shot at him running away, causing the Xia Tian from the First Space-Time to fall to the ground with a shot in the leg.
1:27:54|1:27:59|At this moment, the gun ran out of bullets, and he quickly got up and ran through the harbor gate.
1:28:55|1:28:58|At this moment, [Xia Tian] from the second timeline walked in with a gun.
1:29:0|1:29:5|[Xia Tian] from the Third Space-Time put down his arms, turned to look at him, and took a step forward.
1:30:6|1:30:27|Both of them fired their guns at the same time. [Xia Tian] from the second timeline was shot in the left shoulder, while [Xia Tian] from the third timeline was shot in the heart. With a furrowed brow, she stared ahead and then tried to look back, but her body involuntarily knelt down on the ground. She then slumped to the ground, with [Xia Tian] from the second timeline enduring the pain in her shoulder, not daring to relax.
1:30:28|1:30:41|At this moment, [Xia Tian] from the Third Space-Time raised her head, took two steps forward, blood trickled from her mouth, then uncontrollably spat out two mouthfuls of blood, her body swaying slightly before collapsing completely to the ground.
1:30:45|1:30:54|In the second time and space, [Xia Tian] watched as tears streamed down his face, covering his wound and unable to bear looking at him any longer, he lowered his head and shook it.
1:30:54|1:30:59|In the first time and space, [Xia Tian] stood behind, panting and staring blankly in place.
1:30:59|1:31:4|In the Third Space-Time, [Xia Tian] is lying on the ground with a gun hanging by his side, a large amount of blood seeping from his chest.
1:31:7|1:31:13|Explosions are happening throughout the research institute, with concrete falling from high above, ready to strike at any moment.
1:31:13|1:31:27|In the first timeline, [Xia Tian] dragged his injured leg to the front of the second timeline [Xia Tian], wanting to see its wound, but the second timeline [Xia Tian] dodged sideways, covering its still bleeding shoulder and lowering its head.
1:31:47|1:31:50|In the second timeline, [Xia Tian] is pushing the arm of the first timeline's [Xia Tian].
1:31:50|1:31:56|In the first time and space, [Xia Tian] shed tears, glanced at the teleporter, then looked at him, and walked towards the elevator.
1:31:56|1:31:58|She, who opened the elevator door, turned around.
1:31:58|1:32:1|In the second time and space, [Xia Tian] is already standing in the teleporter.
1:32:12|1:32:16|In the first time and space, [Xia Tian] enters the elevator and presses the floor button.
1:32:16|1:32:22|In the line of sight, [Xia Tian] in the second time-space looked up in the transporter.
1:32:22|1:32:27|In the sea of fire, outside the entire building, more and more parts began to collapse.
1:32:27|1:32:31|In the first time and space, [Xia Tian] rushes out of the elevator, supporting the cart next to her, and then moves to the lamppost.
1:32:46|1:32:53|[Da Xiong] leaned on the ground with a punch, his injured abdomen still bleeding, and [Xia Tian] from the first spacetime quickly supported his arm.
1:32:53|1:32:59|In the hospital, [Dou Dou] woke up on the bed and sat up, looking around.
1:32:59|1:33:12|In the teleportation room, [Xia Tian] from the second time-space came to his senses. The blood on his face had already partially dried. After taking a deep breath, he turned around. Tears welled up in his eyes. He blinked and then clicked on the recombination sample on the screen.
1:33:13|1:33:18|The on-screen confirm button is no longer clickable, with only 0% still lit up.
1:33:18|1:33:22|He knew it was a hundred percent, the screen turned completely white and started flickering.
1:33:22|1:33:30|His hand paused in mid-air, hesitated for a moment, then he pursed his lips in determination. Slowly, his blood-stained hand moved closer to the screen.
1:33:30|1:33:35|At this moment, the phone in his pocket suddenly vibrated, he paused for a moment, obviously surprised.
1:33:36|1:33:45|He lowered his head, slowly put his hand into his pocket, and the phone screen showed an incoming call from [Dou Dou]. The hand holding the phone involuntarily tightened.
1:33:45|1:33:50|He raised his hand, but then glanced at the screen, and finally slid to answer the call.
1:33:50|1:33:53|At this moment, [Dou Dou] is outside the hospital ward, with an IV stand still attached to his hand.
1:35:38|1:35:45|At this moment, [Xia Tian] in the second timeline had tears all over her face. After smiling and speaking to [Dou Dou], she immediately turned into a sad expression.
1:35:45|1:35:50|She then hung up the phone, while [Dou Dou] kept staring at the mobile phone.
1:35:50|1:35:59|On the overpass, [Huang Chen] sitting in the ambulance, sees [Xia Tian] from the first time and space, helping [Da Xiong] walk over.
1:35:59|1:35:59|[Huang Chen] jumps out of the car.
1:36:2|1:36:6|One on the left and one on the right, with the help of medical staff, they placed [Da Xiong] in the car.
1:36:54|1:37:1|On the twentieth day, [Xia Tian] went down below the teleporter, opened his arms, and once again fell into that place that seemed like another world.
1:37:1|1:37:11|This time, he lay quietly, his hair swaying on his face, tears welling up in his eyes as images of [Dou Dou] appeared.
1:37:11|1:37:15|Reading to [Dou Dou] in bed, the two of them share a joyful and laughter-filled moment.
1:37:16|1:37:25|[Dou Dou] and his own smiling face are very clear. With this thought, he closed his eyes. As tears fell, they quickly began to dissipate.
1:37:25|1:37:30|Recalling the scene where he and [Dou Dou] were on the mountaintop, waving at the aircraft and chasing after it.
1:37:30|1:37:35|[Dou Dou] pulled him towards the aircraft, holding a phone in one hand and embracing [Dou Dou] with the other.
1:37:37|1:37:49|As more and more tears floated in the air, her face gradually dissipated from the edges, followed by her clothes, her limbs, and further down was a fiery light.
1:37:49|1:37:55|[Xia Tian] from the second time-space gradually merged with the beam of light and disappeared.
1:37:55|1:38:3|In the hospital, [Dou Dou] is sitting in the lobby waiting. From the first time-space, [Xia Tian] runs into the corridor, leaning against the wall and holding her injured leg. When she sees [Dou Dou], she shouts, "Dou Dou!"
1:38:14|1:38:21|[Dou Dou] immediately stood up and pushed the IV stand over, while [Xia Tian] also squatted down and spread her legs.
1:38:21|1:38:25|He saw that [Dou Dou]'s neck had been bandaged, and he hugged [Dou Dou] again, patting his head.
1:38:29|1:38:37|This time, [Xia Tian] held [Dou Dou]'s face, looked at him with a smile, and then tightly hugged [Dou Dou], tears streaming down.
1:38:37|1:38:42|[Dou Dou] hugged [Xia Tian], resting his head on his shoulder, and also showed a smile.
