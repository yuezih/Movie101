0:0:53|0:1:8|The father returned to the room first, the mother looked at her son standing at the door, splashed the dirty water from the bowl next to him, placed the bowl on the table, gave the boy a glare, and then also went back into the room.
0:1:8|0:1:14|A young man stood alone at the door, with a backpack on his back and a suitcase in his hand.
0:1:20|0:1:26|From a distance, smoke was rising from the low thatched houses of [Wang Youzhi]'s family.
0:1:26|0:1:30|The wheat field at the door and the trees behind the house shine brightly in the mountain valley.
0:1:30|0:1:35|The man watched as his mother closed the door, and could only pick up his suitcase and leave.
0:1:35|0:1:45|Walking alone in the wheat field, occasionally looking back towards the house door.
0:1:45|0:1:49|As they walked further away, the title of the film "Returning Home" gradually appeared on the wheat field.
0:1:52|0:1:59|In the quaint courtyard, [Wang Youzhi] dragged the heavy suitcase across the threshold and entered the courtyard.
0:1:59|0:2:3|Late at night, all is quiet with only the distant barking of dogs echoing in the silence.
0:2:3|0:2:8|[Wang Youzhi] was also looking around and surveying the courtyard, only to see a small door beside him with light shining through.
0:2:12|0:2:18|[Ding Xiuxiu] walked slowly forward and saw a girl washing her hair in the courtyard behind the small gate.
0:2:18|0:2:22|The girl seemed to have heard someone approaching and quickly walked away.
0:2:22|0:2:28|So when [Wang Youzhi] approached the small gate and looked inside, the courtyard was already empty, with only two pots left in the courtyard.
0:2:33|0:2:39|As soon as the door was pushed open, they were met with a surprise - a man and a woman were sitting inside the room.
0:2:41|0:2:43|[Han Ailin] also felt a bit guilty.
0:3:11|0:3:15|Serving a bowl of nicely presented noodles, explained to [Wang Youzhi].
0:3:18|0:3:23|[Wang Youzhi] is tidying up the bed, then hears a noise and goes to the table, bending down to smell it.
0:3:28|0:3:34|Han Ailin was still standing beside him, while [Wang Youzhi] asked Han Ailin while eating.
0:4:5|0:4:12|But with a rooster's crow, the sensitive morning light illuminated the entire village.
0:4:12|0:4:22|[Wang Youzhi] was still sleeping in the mosquito net, half awake, half asleep, when some noisy voices seemed to be coming from outside, only to hear a sharp female voice ringing out.
0:4:52|0:4:58|The couple finally quieted down, with [Wang Youzhi] sitting silently on the side, his face bearing a clear palm print from the slap that was just mistakenly deleted.
0:5:6|0:5:15|The village chief waved his hand for the two to leave quickly, but Wang Youzhi didn't even look at them.
0:5:31|0:5:34|The two of them left quietly.
0:5:34|0:5:37|The village chief looked at the two and shook his head, sighing as he explained.
0:6:34|0:6:39|At the entrance of the village committee, [Ding Dapeng] stood in the middle of the road, attracting the attention of passersby.
0:6:39|0:6:44|At this moment, [Wang Youzhi] came out from the village committee and started a conversation.
0:6:44|0:6:49|Ding Dapeng handed the apple in his hand to [Wang Youzhi], who was overjoyed.
0:6:50|0:6:59|[Wang Youzhi] picked up the apple and quickly ran away, only to see a beautiful woman sitting by the river, with the bamboo and her graceful figure reflected in the river.
0:6:59|0:7:7|In the distance, [Wang Youzhi] ran towards the beautiful woman, who was still immersed in the beautiful scenery and had not noticed anyone approaching.
0:7:7|0:7:10|[Wang Youzhi] quietly approached behind the beauty and pretended to cover her eyes.
0:7:44|0:7:46|The two held hands and sat down, with [Wang Youzhi] about to kiss his girlfriend.
0:8:13|0:8:21|A middle-aged woman carrying a stele tower passed by and saw this scene.
0:8:39|0:8:43|[Ding Xiuxiu]'s mother gave [Wang Youzhi] a stern look, then gave her own daughter a disappointed look.
0:8:49|0:8:53|Receiving affirmation, [Ding Xiuxiu]'s mother spoke thoughtfully.
0:9:2|0:9:6|[Wang Youzhi] started his visiting work, asking questions and taking notes, and even went to the school.
0:9:17|0:9:22|[Wang Youzhi] visits during the day, organizes materials at night, and goes door to door to inquire, leaving no family behind.
0:9:25|0:9:31|When it comes to [Ding Xiuxiu]'s home, everything is strictly following the procedure, even though [Ding Xiuxiu] is his girlfriend.
0:9:31|0:9:42|Sometimes you also encounter those who pretend to be poor, like the couple [Wang Liang], who stopped [Wang Youzhi] halfway and tangled with him. [Wang Liang]'s wife even dabbed a bit of saliva as tears, wailing and shouting at [Wang Youzhi].
0:9:44|0:9:51|But [Wang Youzhi] did not waver at all, still dealing with the situation based on reality, even though [Wang Liang] and his wife are still relatives.
0:9:51|0:10:0|Finally, [Wang Youzhi] arrived at his home and found his parents still working in the fields. His father stood up straight, saw [Wang Youzhi], but then lowered his head to continue working.
0:10:0|0:10:5|The mother also saw Wang Youzhi, but she just looked at him quietly without saying a word.
0:10:5|0:10:10|Although [Wang Youzhi] is not understood by his parents, he still dutifully runs around for the village's subsistence allowance.
0:10:13|0:10:17|After the visit, he immersed himself in the active discussions at the village committee.
0:10:17|0:10:32|He did not directly draw a conclusion, but integrated the opinions of other members of the village committee to reach a final conclusion.
0:10:32|0:10:35|[Wang Youzhi] and [Ding Xiuxiu] are still getting along as usual.
0:10:39|0:10:49|Once, the two crossed the river without an umbrella, so they had to use a bamboo hat for cover. A young man behind them offered an umbrella to Ding Xiuxiu, but Wang Youzhi and Ding Xiuxiu ignored him and ran off together.
0:10:49|0:10:57|When it was time to announce the first protected quota, the villagers crowded in front of the notice board to check, and the first name on the list was [Zhao Xiao'e].
0:10:57|0:11:5|[Ding Xiuxiu] is busy in the kitchen at home at this moment. She stir-fries the dishes, packs them into takeaway boxes, puts them in a basket, and then carries the basket out.
0:11:6|0:11:11|Unexpectedly, as soon as he left the house, he ran into his own mother and quickly hid the basket behind him, explaining.
0:12:34|0:12:43|After speaking, Wang Youzhi's mother walked out the door with Wang Youzhi's dirty clothes, and Wang Youzhi got up to see his mother off.
0:12:43|0:12:53|At this moment, [Han Ailin] sneaked into [Wang Youzhi]'s room, looked at the meal brought by [Wang Youzhi]'s mother, couldn't help but pick up the chopsticks and took a bite, nodding in approval.
0:13:18|0:13:21|At that moment, [Ding Xiuxiu] arrived.
0:13:21|0:13:24|Seeing the intimate interaction between the two, she turned her head in anger and walked away.
0:14:59|0:15:5|The young man looked at [Ding Xiuxiu], who was spinning yarn, and ignored him, thinking of a solution.
0:15:5|0:15:11|Seeing the bench next to him, [Li Xiaobao] politely offered it to [Ding Xiuxiu] to sit on, and said to [Ding Xiuxiu].
0:16:49|0:16:53|Finally calming down Wang Jianguo and his wife, it's already dark outside.
0:16:53|0:16:59|[Wang Youzhi] was studying in his own room when he was suddenly startled by a brick smashing through the window.
0:16:59|0:17:4|He quickly got up and chased out, but only saw a figure flashing through the courtyard, which also startled [Han Ailin].
0:17:36|0:17:42|The villagers scattered, and [Wang Youzhi] did not notice that [Ding Xiuxiu] was also among the crowd.
0:17:42|0:17:49|[Ding Xiuxiu] didn't call [Wang Youzhi], but went quietly to the back of the courtyard, only to be shocked by what she saw.
0:17:49|0:17:55|She saw [Han Ailin] sitting on [Wang Youzhi]'s bed folding clothes, [Ding Xiuxiu] once again left the village committee in anger, completely ignoring [Wang Youzhi].
0:19:1|0:19:7|After listening to the village chief, [Wang Youzhi] lowered his head and looked at the brick in his hand, lost in thought.
0:19:7|0:19:10|At the bridge by the village river, [Wang Youzhi]'s mom met [Ding Xiuxiu]'s mom.
0:19:48|0:19:53|[Wang Youzhi]'s father failed to intervene and instead accidentally fell into the river.
0:19:53|0:19:59|[Wang Youzhi] hurried home in a panic and coincidentally ran into [Wang Youzhi]'s mother carrying a basin into the house.
0:20:29|0:20:39|[Wang Youzhi]'s mother heartlessly closed the door, leaving [Wang Youzhi] standing outside feeling lost. However, through the door, he could still hear his mother's sobbing.
0:20:39|0:20:44|[Wang Youzhi] turned around like a walking dead, sighed deeply, and left the house.
0:20:46|0:20:50|And unbeknownst to him, this scene was just witnessed by [Ding Xiuxiu] who had rushed over.
0:20:50|0:20:58|He wanted to call out to [Wang Youzhi], but didn't know how to speak up, so he could only stand still and watch as [Wang Youzhi] walked away.
0:20:58|0:21:8|In the evening, [Wang Youzhi] sat at the table, recalling recent events. It seemed like he had made a decision. Slowly, he took out a pen and paper, and wrote a few words requesting a transfer report.
0:21:14|0:21:33|Under the cover of night, [Wang Youzhi] sat alone on the steps, recalling the village chief's recent response. Bathed in moonlight, [Wang Youzhi]'s silhouette appeared particularly lonely, but the village chief's words seemed to have an effect.
0:21:33|0:21:41|The next day, [Wang Youzhi] arrived at the mayor's office early in the morning. At this time, the mayor was still busy approving documents, explaining to [Wang Youzhi] while working.
0:22:9|0:22:11|[Wang Youzhi] is wiping the handrail of the stairs.
0:22:11|0:22:15|The mayor came out of the office, and [Wang Youzhi] was mopping the floor at the office door.
0:22:15|0:22:19|Wherever the mayor goes, he follows.
0:22:19|0:22:23|The mayor, Wang Youzhi, was so angry that he had no choice but to return to his office.
0:22:23|0:22:28|Reluctantly, [Wang Youzhi]'s actions also angered the cleaning lady enough to quickly seek the mayor to complain.
0:22:46|0:22:51|The mayor turned to look at [Wang Youzhi], who was wiping something, then turned back and went into the office.
0:22:51|0:22:54|Shortly after, [Wang Youzhi], who was mopping the floor, was called over.
0:22:58|0:23:4|[Wang Youzhi] excitedly put down the mop and hurried to meet the mayor.
0:23:46|0:23:50|The village chief was nailed in place by Wang Youzhi's words, answering in disbelief.
0:24:9|0:24:13|The village director sat angrily at the table in front of the village committee.
0:24:30|0:24:39|Wang Youzhi and Han Ailin got to work right away at the riverbank near the village entrance.
0:24:39|0:24:44|Wang Youzhi's mother crossing the bridge was delighted to see her busy son.
0:24:44|0:24:47|Ding Xiuxiu, who was not paying attention to the road, bumped into Wang Youzhi's mother, and the two started fighting again.
0:25:0|0:25:6|[Wang Youzhi] looked at Yongzhi and [Han Ailin] planting on the wooden board of [Ding Xiuxiu] with satisfaction, and left happily.
0:25:6|0:25:15|With the help of the children, [Wang Youzhi] and [Han Ailin] were working hard. The [village chief] saw them from a distance, sighed deeply, shook his head, and walked away.
0:25:17|0:25:33|Unexpectedly, Ding Xiuxiu and Ding Dapeng also passed by the riverbank. Ding Xiuxiu looked at the two of them with some intimacy in their actions, with a hint of anger in her eyes.
0:25:33|0:25:39|It turned out that [Han Ailin] was wiping the sweat for [Wang Youzhi], and [Wang Youzhi] wiped it back, which happened to be seen by [Ding Xiuxiu].
0:25:41|0:25:45|Watching the two playing around, [Ding Xiuxiu] angrily twisted her hand on [Ding Dapeng].
0:25:54|0:25:59|And [Wang Youzhi] was focused on the board, completely unaware of what was happening on the bridge.
0:27:15|0:27:36|The villagers scattered, even the officials like [Village Chief] stood up and walked past [Wang Youzhi], leaving the village committee.
0:27:36|0:27:47|[Wang Youzhi]'s father scolded [Wang Youzhi]'s mother, who looked back with a worried expression, reluctant to leave as she gazed at her son standing alone.
0:27:47|0:27:52|[Ding Xiuxiu] was the last one to leave. Before leaving, she looked deeply at [Wang Youzhi].
0:27:52|0:27:57|[Wang Youzhi] hesitated, wanting to call out to [Ding Xiuxiu], but before he could speak, she had already walked away.
0:28:0|0:28:14|[Wang Youzhi] looked at the scene where the firecrackers had just gone off, the excitement of life, now leaving only his courtyard empty, and then saw the countdown sign he had worked hard to make, sitting weakly on the steps of the village committee yard, recalling everything that had happened.
0:28:28|0:28:48|Ailin looked at her sitting alone in the empty neighborhood committee courtyard, full of heartache, so she walked up and sat beside [Wang Youzhi], warmly encouraging her.
0:28:48|0:28:51|Wang Youzhi turned his head to look at Ailin, his gaze becoming determined.
0:28:52|0:28:57|The two of them hit it off right away, so they decided to start with the parents of the school.
0:29:34|0:29:41|Parents from the school left one after another, but Wang Youzhi and Han Ailin still didn't give up. When the villagers saw them, they started running.
0:30:2|0:30:17|Two of them went door-to-door knocking, either being rejected or the door not being opened at all. Some even let out vicious dogs to chase them away. They fled in panic with the dog in hot pursuit. Ailin tripped and Wang Youzhi had to carry her on his back.
0:31:0|0:31:5|Unexpectedly, [Ding Xiuxiu] and [Li Xiaobao] crossed paths, and Xiuxiu angrily left while holding Xiaobao.
0:31:25|0:31:28|Xiuxiu completely ignored Xiaobao and walked away.
0:31:28|0:31:36|Xiaobao was feeling regretful one moment, and the next moment he recalled Xiuxiu intimately linking arms with him, and he smiled happily.
0:31:36|0:31:42|Han Ailin returned to the village committee, quickly took a shower, and was drying her hair as she walked out of the house.
0:31:42|0:31:46|Suddenly, a raw egg was thrown at [Wang Youzhi]'s head while he was drying his hair.
0:31:46|0:31:47|Looked up and saw it was [Ding Dapeng] brother.
0:31:51|0:31:54|He held his hand up high, and even wanted to throw a second one.
0:31:54|0:32:7|Seeing [Han Ailin] staring at him, he put down the eggs in his hand and timidly spoke to [Han Ailin].
0:32:7|0:32:18|After speaking, [Ding Dapeng] turned around arrogantly and left, leaving [Han Ailin] standing in place full of questions, not knowing what to do, looking at the egg liquid all over her head, and saying nothing.
0:32:23|0:32:29|Wang Youzhi crazily splashed the water from the river onto his own head to wake himself up.
0:32:29|0:32:34|Ignoring the pouring rain, he stood alone with his back bare on the river bank.
0:32:34|0:32:37|A mother who couldn't bear it any longer walked up to [Wang Youzhi] with an umbrella.
0:34:2|0:34:5|The next person appeared at the door of the tavern was [Li Xiaobao].
0:34:5|0:34:7|[Li Xiaobao] is training the waiters at the front desk.
0:35:53|0:35:58|[Wang Youzhi] gave [Li Xiaobao] a punch directly, and the two of them started fighting. Luckily, a waiter stepped in to break it up.
0:36:0|0:36:10|In the evening, [Wang Youzhi] returned to the village committee with a face full of injuries, touching the prop stone tablet he made with a sense of powerlessness. [Han Ailin] ran over to ask him urgently.
0:36:10|0:36:11|[Wang Youzhi] finished speaking and sat down on the steps.
0:36:29|0:36:35|[Han Ailin] sighed deeply and sat down as well.
0:37:0|0:37:8|Under the cover of night, [Han Ailin] smiled as she looked at [Wang Youzhi], believing that things would be resolved.
0:37:8|0:37:16|The next day, under the shining sun, the village was peaceful and tranquil, and the mountains bathed in sunlight appeared particularly upright.
0:37:16|0:37:38|Villagers gathered at the village committee as planned, looking at the countdown sign showing the tenth day. Everyone was discussing animatedly, while [Village Chief] furrowed his brows, pacing back and forth anxiously, but still no sign of [Wang Youzhi]. At that moment, [Wang Youzhi] was still in his room, splashing cold water on his face repeatedly, trying to become more alert.
0:37:38|0:37:46|He looked up at his reflection in the mirror, despite the scars around his eyes and mouth, his gaze was filled with determination.
0:37:46|0:37:57|[Ding Xiuxiu] also came to the village committee today. She stood in the crowd, looking worriedly at [Wang Youzhi]'s room. Unexpectedly, her eyes met [Han Ailin]'s, and [Ding Xiuxiu] immediately turned her head in anger.
0:38:8|0:38:13|The crowd became more and more agitated, with everyone below discussing animatedly, with [Wang Liang] and his wife standing out in particular.
0:38:39|0:38:43|In the room, [Wang Youzhi] is still making final preparations.
0:38:43|0:38:53|He put on a suit, tied a tie, and repeatedly adjusted his clothes in front of the mirror, as if boosting his own confidence.
0:38:53|0:38:56|After taking a deep sigh, [Wang Youzhi] finally stepped out of the room.
0:38:59|0:39:7|With a sound of the door opening, the villagers stopped their discussion and became quiet, all looking towards the source of the sound.
0:39:7|0:39:15|[Wang Youzhi] walked out from behind the door, looking at each face filled with eagerness. He looked very carefully, as if he would never see them again after this.
0:39:19|0:39:28|He slowly walked through the crowd towards the stage, passing by his parents with a smile, reassuring them not to worry.
0:39:28|0:39:38|In front of everyone's gaze, [Wang Youzhi] walked towards the stage. His eyes were focused, he turned to face the villagers, but did not rush to speak. Instead, he bowed deeply to the villagers.
0:39:53|0:39:58|The villagers looked puzzled, but they just waited quietly for [Wang Youzhi] to speak.
0:39:58|0:40:1|[Wang Youzhi] stood up straight and slowly began to speak.
0:41:16|0:41:24|The villagers lowered their heads in silence. [Wang Youzhi]'s father looked at the silent crowd, raised his hand first, setting an example.
0:41:25|0:41:33|[Wang Youzhi]'s father walked out of the crowd, stood in front of his son, took out the money carefully wrapped in a handkerchief, and said to [Wang Youzhi].
0:41:41|0:41:49|[Wang Youzhi] took the money handed to him by his father, moved to tears. Before he could say anything, his father turned and left.
0:41:49|0:41:54|[Wang Youzhi] handed over the unusually heavy money to the [village chief] in front of all the villagers.
0:41:59|0:42:3|[Wang Youzhi] did not answer the village chief, but directly pushed the money into the village chief's arms.
0:42:3|0:42:7|Ding Xiuxiu in the audience couldn't stand it anymore, stood up and walked onto the stage.
0:42:7|0:42:10|Ding Xiuxiu's mother reached out to stop Ding Xiuxiu.
0:42:28|0:42:31|[Ding Dapeng] nodded on the side and reached out to grab [Ding Xiuxiu]'s mother.
0:42:31|0:42:41|[Ding Xiuxiu] went up on stage with money and handed it to [Village Chief].
0:42:41|0:42:48|[Wang Youzhi]'s gaze has been following [Ding Xiuxiu], but [Ding Xiuxiu] didn't even stop, not even looking at her, and walked off the stage.
0:42:51|0:42:58|The auntie in the audience watched as [Ding Xiuxiu] donated money, her head slightly lifted, and she also trembled as she stood up unsteadily, ready to donate money.
0:42:58|0:42:59|The village chief hurried forward to help.
0:43:40|0:43:46|The auntie took out the money she was holding, some in coins and some in bills, showing that it was saved up little by little.
0:44:12|0:44:16|The villagers were greatly inspired and came forward to donate money.
0:44:16|0:44:19|The road construction has finally made it onto the agenda.
0:44:19|0:44:25|The steamroller entered the village, and trucks of cement were poured into the village, and the workers began their labor.
0:44:25|0:44:29|The steamroller passed by, and the newly paved cement road looked exceptionally wide.
0:44:29|0:44:38|[Wang Youzhi] and [Han Ailin] led the children to watch the construction team from a distance, witnessing the new road gradually taking shape, bringing smiles to everyone's faces.
0:44:39|0:44:45|The children laughed loudly, shouted, held hands, stomped their feet, and [Wang Youzhi] also shouted excitedly.
0:44:50|0:44:54|[Wang Youzhi] and [Han Ailin] embraced each other to share their joy.
0:44:54|0:45:4|[Han Ailin] shyly lowered her head, while [Wang Youzhi], immersed in joy, didn't notice [Han Ailin]'s change at all.
0:45:15|0:45:36|[Han Ailin] looked at [Wang Youzhi] with a smile, and at that moment, [Wang Youzhi]'s father also came to check on the progress of the road construction.
0:45:36|0:45:42|Han Ailin took the children away, and Wang Youzhi's father watched them leave before slowly approaching Wang Youzhi.
0:45:47|0:45:51|Looking at the road being constructed in the distance, Ding Xiuxiu slowly spoke to Wang Youzhi.
0:46:22|0:46:30|Father and son stood side by side, looking at the road under construction. Their silhouettes, one big and one small, appeared particularly upright at this moment.
0:46:30|0:46:36|[Wang Youzhi] had tears in his eyes, looking into the distance with a determined and serious expression.
0:46:36|0:46:43|He made a firm resolution in his heart, determined not to let his father down and to make the village prosperous as soon as possible.
0:46:43|0:46:45|With the support of his father, [Wang Youzhi] is full of confidence.
0:46:48|0:46:54|That night, [Wang Youzhi] was hunched over his computer desk, writing something while looking up information on the computer.
0:46:54|0:47:0|Ailing appeared at the door of her room, but she didn't notice.
0:47:0|0:47:16|Ailing, wearing pajamas and holding a large water cup, hesitantly crossed the threshold, then stopped, straightened her clothes and hair. She then walked lightly to the side of [Wang Youzhi], placed the water cup on the table, and smiled as she spoke to [Wang Youzhi].
0:47:26|0:47:34|[Wang Youzhi] was so engrossed in writing his book that he answered Ailing without even looking up, completely unaware of Ailing's change in mood.
0:47:34|0:47:40|Ailin looked at [Wang Youzhi] who seemed indifferent to her, and the effectiveness of the speech was immediately lost.
0:47:40|0:47:44|She came to find [Wang Youzhi] happily, but he didn't appreciate her advances and walked away.
0:47:47|0:47:53|Ailin was a little angry, but seeing [Wang Youzhi] not even looking at her, she could only turn around and leave silently.
0:47:53|0:48:8|Ailin arrived at the door, couldn't help but turn around to look at [Wang Youzhi], but [Wang Youzhi] remained unmoved. Ailin felt disappointed and could only leave with a low mood.
0:48:8|0:48:14|Early the next morning, [Wang Youzhi] took the proposal he had written and found the [Village Chief] and several other leaders of the village committee.
0:48:16|0:48:24|Everyone carefully read the proposal written by [Wang Youzhi], and they all thought it was great. [The village chief] even praised it continuously.
0:48:53|0:48:56|The village chief shook his head and sighed, while Wang Youzhi smiled and spoke up beside him.
0:49:3|0:49:7|After speaking, [Wang Youzhi] quickly ran to [Ding Xiuxiu]'s house.
0:49:7|0:49:14|Wang Youzhi was unexpectedly stopped by [Ding Dapeng] as soon as he arrived at the door. He saw [Ding Dapeng] holding a wooden stick with a ribbon tied to it.
0:49:14|0:49:16|See [Wang Youzhi] coming over, holding a stick directly towards him.
0:49:20|0:49:27|[Ding Dapeng] arrogantly turned his head away and ignored [Wang Youzhi]. Wherever [Wang Youzhi] went, [Ding Dapeng] pointed his stick at him.
0:49:27|0:49:31|[Wang Youzhi] came up with a plan and took out corn, [Ding Dapeng]'s favorite, from his bag.
0:49:34|0:49:40|[Ding Dapeng] couldn't take his eyes off the corn, slowly approaching as [Wang Youzhi] watched.
0:49:40|0:49:46|Suddenly, the sound of a wooden stick falling is heard, and [Ding Dapeng] quickly wakes up.
0:49:46|0:49:53|Continuously shaking his head, [Wang Youzhi] held a wooden stick and faced [Wang Youzhi], who had no choice but to shout loudly.
0:49:58|0:50:12|[Wang Youzhi] looked towards [Ding Xiuxiu]'s house, but heard no sound coming from inside. Feeling disappointed, [Wang Youzhi] saw no other way, especially with [Ding Dapeng] blocking his path. After some thought, he had no choice but to give up.
0:50:12|0:50:19|[Wang Youzhi] took out a plastic bag from his bag, wrapped the corn in it, and placed it on the ground, indicating that [Ding Dapeng] would eat it later.
0:50:19|0:50:22|After everything was done, [Wang Youzhi] reluctantly left [Ding Xiuxiu]'s home.
0:50:24|0:50:36|[Ding Dapeng] saw [Wang Youzhi] leaving, glanced at the corn cob he had already gnawed clean in his left hand and the fresh one on the ground, happily threw away the one in his left hand, and turned to pick up the corn on the ground.
0:50:36|0:50:44|Picking up the corn and starting to gnaw on it, constantly making chewing sounds, it's obvious that he's enjoying the food.
0:50:44|0:50:49|He continued to guard the house while eating corn, picking up a stick to stand watch.
0:51:2|0:51:8|[Wang Youzhi] didn't go far. He picked up corn in the greenhouse, but no one came out of the house.
0:51:8|0:51:17|He was sure that [Ding Xiuxiu] was not at home, although he remembered something and took out his phone from his bag to make a call, only to hear the voice of the line being unreachable.
0:51:28|0:51:40|However, at this time, [Ding Xiuxiu] arrived at the riverside where [Wang Youzhi] often had dates. [Ding Xiuxiu] stood there alone, looking upset, clearly angry with [Wang Youzhi].
0:51:40|0:51:47|[Ding Xiuxiu] had been alone for a while, and as she turned to leave, she unexpectedly ran into [Wang Youzhi] who had been looking for her.
0:51:54|0:51:56|[Ding Xiuxiu] saw [Wang Youzhi] and immediately ran away.
0:51:56|0:52:7|[Wang Youzhi] from the alliance caught [Ding Xiuxiu] and didn't let her go.
0:52:7|0:52:9|[Ding Xiuxiu] stopped struggling and let [Wang Youzhi] hold her.
0:52:51|0:52:57|[Ding Xiuxiu] let go, [Wang Youzhi] grabbed her hand and turned around with his back facing [Ding Xiuxiu].
0:52:57|0:53:0|[Wang Youzhi] flicked [Ding Xiuxiu]'s nose bridge and explained.
0:53:47|0:53:50|The two had previous conflicts but finally reconciled.
0:53:50|0:54:0|The sunlight at this moment is just right, shining through the two who are kissing, spreading warmth, everything is moving in a positive direction.
0:54:0|0:54:6|The villagers' lives are becoming increasingly prosperous, and the village facilities are constantly improving, even the river at the village entrance has become exceptionally clear.
0:54:8|0:54:21|The lush trees are reflected in the river, with sloping mountains in the distance complementing each other, resembling a picturesque pastoral painting from afar.
0:54:21|0:54:26|[Wang Youzhi] was inspired by [Ding Xiuxiu] to start preparing the issue of greenhouse vegetables.
0:54:26|0:54:33|[Wang Youzhi] shuttles between the township government and the village committee, working day and night to promote the success of the project.
0:54:33|0:54:37|He handles everything with a light touch, such as going to the bank to apply for a loan and other small matters.
0:54:42|0:54:55|Finally, the village committee posted notices again. This time, the villagers became proactive, and the village committee became particularly lively, in stark contrast to the previous desolation.
0:54:55|0:55:8|That day, [Ding Xiuxiu] and [Wang Youzhi] came to the riverbank at the village entrance again. The two sat side by side on a stone, with clear river water in front of them and a crisp bamboo forest beside them. [Ding Xiuxiu] leaned on [Wang Youzhi]'s shoulder, and the two were talking.
0:56:30|0:56:38|[Ding Xiuxiu] could only find [Li Xiaobao], and the two sat in [Li Xiaobao]'s restaurant talking, with a hint of reluctance in [Li Xiaobao]'s expression.
0:57:20|0:57:25|In the greenhouse, after being asked by [Wang Youzhi]'s father, he nodded in satisfaction.
0:57:25|0:57:37|In the evening, [Han Ailin] was washing clothes in the room. She finished washing and was about to hang the clothes in the yard when she ran into [Ding Xiuxiu] carrying a basket of vegetables.
0:58:49|0:58:57|As the words fell, the magnificent cooking competition officially began. In the courtyard, there were ingredients, various kitchen utensils, and seasonings everywhere.
0:58:57|0:59:3|The villagers sat around, the referee sat on the high platform, and [the village head] officially announced the start of the competition.
0:59:47|0:59:58|Amidst the applause, [Han Ailin] and [Ding Xiuxiu] appeared at the venue dressed in chef's uniforms and hats, followed by their respective assistants, [Ding Xiuxiu]'s mother and [Wang Liang]'s wife.
0:59:58|1:0:7|[Li Xiaobao] and [Wang Youzhi]'s mother stood up and applauded at the judges' table, [Wang Youzhi] was pulled up in a daze, staring wide-eyed at the two entering the room, extremely surprised.
1:0:10|1:0:22|Upon reaching their designated positions, Ling and [Ding Xiuxiu] glared at each other disapprovingly, both turning their heads away in a huff.
1:0:35|1:1:7|The deceivers win this competition without a set theme, allowing the contestants to freely showcase their skills. I announce that the competition is now officially beginning. With the command from the [Village Chief], the competition officially starts. Both sides immediately enter into a busy preparation mode. From their chopping techniques, it's clear that both are experienced. The carrots are sliced as thin as cicada wings.
1:1:7|1:1:9|Even the lettuce is cut as thin as hair.
1:1:12|1:1:19|[Ding Xiuxiu] prepared some cold noodles here, and only saw the tempting cold noodles being carefully cut into a small strip by [Ding Xiuxiu].
1:1:19|1:1:29|Ding Xiuxiu's mother is also helping [Ding Xiuxiu] prepare the side dishes, finely chopping the green onions and sprinkling them on the jelly noodles, accompanied by the appropriate sauce, just the thought of it makes one's mouth water.
1:1:29|1:1:38|Ailin chose apples, peeled and cut them into pieces, added other fruits, cooked them, added the right sauce, and it looked sour and sweet.
1:1:42|1:1:54|Although it's a competition, everyone is handling it with ease and in an orderly manner. The most nervous one turns out to be [Wang Youzhi].
1:1:54|1:2:1|Finally, the two finished their competition, plated the dishes they had prepared, and presented them to the judges on the stage.
1:2:1|1:2:6|[Li Xiaobao] took the lead in tasting, choosing [Ding Xiuxiu]'s cold noodles in a bowl.
1:2:6|1:2:9|The moment he entered, [Wang Liang] was stunned and couldn't help but praise.
1:2:14|1:2:30|Xiuxiu's mother, after tasting the jelly noodles, did not speak, but continued to taste Ailing's fruit, and began to praise it the moment it entered her mouth.
1:2:30|1:2:43|[Wang Youzhi] looked at the two dishes in front of him, feeling indecisive. He glanced at [Ding Xiuxiu] and Ailin standing beside him. Just as he was about to taste Ailin's dish, [Ding Xiuxiu] coughed, and [Wang Youzhi] immediately switched his chopsticks.
1:2:43|1:2:50|Unwillingly, Ailing coughed, causing [Wang Youzhi] to pause with his chopsticks, making the situation more difficult.
1:3:7|1:3:19|[Ding Xiuxiu] and [Han Ailin] returned to the audience, with [Han Ailin] looking nervous and [Ding Xiuxiu] looking expectantly towards the stage. Both of them were anticipating the final outcome.
1:3:19|1:3:21|On stage, [Li Xiaobao] is the first to cast his vote.
1:3:37|1:3:44|[Wang Youzhi] threw one dart and actually lifted two people's signs.
1:3:56|1:4:1|After the [Village Chief] announced a tie, the second round of the match started in full swing.
1:4:1|1:4:8|Both sides were seen choosing to stir-fry this time, heating the oil to release the fragrance of the ingredients, and then adding the carefully selected ingredients by the two.
1:4:8|1:4:12|Before long, the fragrance filled the entire courtyard.
1:4:12|1:4:15|On stage, [Wang Youzhi] watched as the two busy individuals became entangled in a dilemma.
1:4:16|1:4:21|The dishes were ready in no time, and once again they were brought to the judge's table.
1:4:21|1:4:27|This time, [Li Xiaobao] still chose [Ding Xiuxiu], while [Wang Youzhi]'s mom chose [Han Ailin], putting pressure on [Wang Youzhi] again.
1:4:27|1:4:35|After hesitating for a while, she finally crossed her hands with the signs and shouted out.
1:4:35|1:4:40|Han Ailin and Ding Xiuxiu looked disappointed when they saw Wang Youzhi's choice, but they had to start preparing for the third round.
1:4:42|1:4:45|In the third round, both [Ding Xiuxiu] and [Wang Youzhi] prepared soup.
1:4:45|1:4:53|The audience couldn't sit still as they smelled the aroma, standing up one after another to peek into the pot of [Ding Xiuxiu].
1:4:53|1:4:59|The eggs and tomatoes are mixed with a fragrant aroma, sprinkled with finely chopped green onions on top, looking tempting in color, greatly increasing one's appetite.
1:5:2|1:5:10|While [Han Ailin] prepared a white bone broth, the stirring emitted waves of fragrance, rich and refreshing, pleasing to the senses.
1:5:10|1:5:17|[Wang Youzhi] has not opened a single book since sitting on the judging panel, the delicious food has not affected her at all.
1:5:17|1:5:24|But the audience below the stage was different. Around [Ding Xiuxiu], the villagers who couldn't resist the temptation had already gathered, praising her.
1:5:34|1:5:42|After some empty talk, the two of them successfully finished cooking. They ladled the soup into bowls and presented it to the judges' table once again.
1:5:42|1:5:48|The three judges tasted the masterpieces of the two contestants in turn, all showing satisfied expressions.
1:5:48|1:5:59|Of course, except for [Wang Youzhi], who seemed frozen, expressionless, maintaining the posture of holding the bowl, sitting quietly in place, forming a sharp contrast with the expressions of others enjoying the food.
1:6:1|1:6:8|This time, [Ding Xiuxiu] and [Han Ailin] were particularly nervous, their eyes following every move of the judges on the stage.
1:6:8|1:6:11|The outcome of this determines the victory or defeat, and they all know it.
1:6:11|1:6:17|Voting begins, [Li Xiaobao] unsurprisingly votes for [Ding Xiuxiu], while [Wang Youzhi]'s mom also votes for [Han Ailin].
1:6:17|1:6:24|The result was exactly the same as the first two rounds, and the difficult problem was once again given to [Wang Youzhi]. [Wang Youzhi] lowered his head in contemplation, but after a long time, he still couldn't come up with an answer.
1:6:39|1:6:42|[Wang Youzhi] looked at [Han Ailin] with a puzzled expression.
1:6:42|1:6:48|[Han Ailin] fearlessly met the gaze, stood up and walked to the center, facing the judges' table, and spoke loudly.
1:7:4|1:7:19|Everyone was shocked, [Wang Youzhi] was also a little surprised, and [Li Xiaobao] even stood up directly pointing at [Wang Huilan].
1:7:19|1:7:26|The audience below all looked at [Wang Youzhi] as if they were watching a show, and [Wang Youzhi]'s mother was even more delighted.
1:7:26|1:7:29|But Wang Youzhi was not the least bit happy, his brow still furrowed.
1:7:32|1:7:36|At this moment, a torrential rain poured down, and everyone scattered to take cover from the rain.
1:7:36|1:7:44|[Ding Xiuxiu]'s mother also pulled [Ding Xiuxiu] away.
1:7:44|1:7:48|Xiuxiu still wanted a resolution, but she was dragged away by her mother.
1:7:48|1:7:51|[Wang Youzhi] suddenly stood up, looking at the pouring rain as if facing a formidable enemy.
1:8:25|1:8:32|[Wang Youzhi] eventually fell ill and all the villagers gathered at the village committee, shouting loudly.
1:9:6|1:9:9|Wang Youzhi's father, who was squatting on the side, stood up and spoke to everyone.
1:9:45|1:9:53|[Wang Youzhi]'s mother sat in the room, Xiuxiu and Ailin took turns changing the wet towels for [Wang Youzhi], looking worriedly at him lying in bed.
1:9:57|1:10:2|After a while, the sick [Wang Youzhi] finally opened his eyes and struggled to sit up.
1:10:2|1:10:5|[Wang Youzhi] tried to persuade her mother, but in the end, he could only help Xiuxiu out with her.
1:11:18|1:11:24|[Wang Youzhi] fainted again, and Ding Xiuxiu sat by the bed taking care of [Wang Youzhi], only to hear [Wang Youzhi] murmuring.
1:11:45|1:11:52|Sitting by the bed taking care of [Wang Youzhi], Xiuxiu was moved to tears by Wang Youzhi's whispers, and she had already made a decision in her heart.
1:11:55|1:12:9|The next day, Ding Xiuxiu arrived at the entrance of Xiaobao Restaurant. She walked in and then walked out, hesitating at the entrance, pacing back and forth, unable to make up her mind.
1:12:9|1:12:17|Coincidentally, [Wang Youzhi] saw [Ding Xiuxiu] standing at the door, and hurriedly came to her with joy.
1:12:17|1:12:21|[Li Xiaobao] immediately understood the purpose of [Ding Xiuxiu]'s visit, and his smile disappeared instantly.
1:14:49|1:14:55|[Wang Youzhi] turned around angrily, but then turned back with a determined look and said.
1:15:3|1:15:13|[Wang Youzhi] finished speaking and then left without paying much attention, while [Ding Xiuxiu] had lost her previous arrogance and suddenly looked deflated, like a balloon with no air.
1:15:13|1:15:18|The sadness in the eyes could no longer be hidden, tears instantly filled the eye sockets.
1:15:18|1:15:23|The grief was unbearable, but for [Wang Youzhi], she couldn't think of any other way.
1:15:23|1:15:28|Chasing after them, [Han Ailin] watched the two figures gradually moving away, a hint of reluctance in her eyes.
1:15:33|1:15:40|Since Ding Xiuxiu decided to marry Li Xiaobao, Li Xiaobao has been busy all day preparing for the wedding with Ding Xiuxiu's mother.
1:15:40|1:15:48|They first went to see the new house, and [Ding Xiuxiu]'s mother looked around as soon as she entered the door, all the way from the second floor to the first floor, with a smile in her eyes.
1:15:52|1:16:0|It is clear that Ding Xiuxiu's mother is very satisfied with this marriage, and Li Xiaobao is also diligent, always making Ding Xiuxiu's mother smile.
1:16:0|1:16:6|Although [Ding Xiuxiu] never smiled from beginning to end, she remained indifferent when she saw the beautifully decorated new house.
1:16:9|1:16:23|Later, the three of them went to see the diamond ring. [Ding Xiuxiu]'s mother chose a big and shiny diamond ring, holding it in her hand and reluctant to let go. She called [Ding Xiuxiu] over to see, but [Ding Xiuxiu] showed no smile on her face, not even looking at the ring, as if she wasn't the one getting married.
1:16:28|1:16:36|[Li Xiaobao] and [Ding Xiuxiu]'s mother took [Ding Xiuxiu] to try on wedding dresses again. [Ding Xiuxiu] walked past one wedding dress after another, without a hint of impending marriage joy.
1:16:36|1:16:43|[Ding Xiuxiu]'s mother looked at her unhappy daughter, the smile on her face gradually disappearing, feeling a hint of heartache.
1:16:43|1:16:49|She knew that marrying [Wang Liang] was not what [Ding Xiuxiu] willingly wanted.
1:16:49|1:16:56|[Wang Youzhi]'s illness has finally improved, and the matter of the greenhouse vegetables has been put back on the agenda. She led the villagers to replant new vegetables.
1:17:2|1:17:7|[Wang Youzhi] became busy again, as if [Ding Xiuxiu]'s marriage had no impact on him.
1:17:7|1:17:13|During the day, he is busy with the greenhouse vegetables, and at night, he works tirelessly to handle various matters in the village.
1:17:13|1:17:15|Finally, the greenhouse vegetables are starting to take shape.
1:17:15|1:17:20|That day, [Wang Youzhi] walked out of the greenhouse while talking on the phone.
1:17:33|1:17:39|[Han Ailin] walked over and looked at [Wang Youzhi], who had hung up the phone, and asked.
1:17:49|1:17:54|[Wang Youzhi] smiled and answered [Han Ailin], but the worried look in [Han Ailin]'s eyes quickly shifted away.
1:17:54|1:18:1|[Han Ailin] stood still for a long time, [Wang Youzhi] found [Li Xiaobao] with the advanced salary and pushed piles of money in front of [Li Xiaobao].
1:18:26|1:18:37|On the day of the wedding, [Ding Xiuxiu] wore a white wedding dress, with a pure white veil covering her eyes, resembling a cold goddess statue, walking slowly into the church.
1:18:37|1:18:42|At the end of the church is [Li Xiaobao] in a white suit, with guests already seated on both sides.
1:18:45|1:18:58|[Wang Huilan] and [Ding Dapeng] sat in the front row, watching Xiuxiu pass by with joy on her face. Xiuxiu walked expressionlessly to the side of [Li Xiaobao], whose nervousness and excitement were all over his face.
1:18:58|1:19:6|Seeing Xiuxiu so close, Wang Youzhi couldn't help but adjust his suit jacket again and shouted.
1:19:6|1:19:10|Once the two of them stood still, the priest officially began the procedure.
1:20:3|1:20:11|[Ding Xiuxiu] can no longer hear the priest's words at this moment. Her eyes are filled with tears, and all she can think of in her mind are the beautiful memories with [Wang Youzhi].
1:20:11|1:20:18|The two of them huddled under the clothes to avoid the rain, embracing each other, kissing, and all kinds of sweet memories flooded back at this moment.
1:20:26|1:20:33|Perhaps it was the response from [Ding Xiuxiu] after a long absence that made the guests feel that something was amiss, and they all put on serious expressions.
1:20:33|1:20:37|[Ding Xiuxiu]'s mother's smile faded from her face, replaced by a watery gleam in her eyes.
1:20:37|1:20:45|[Li Xiaobao], who was originally praying with his eyes closed, became anxious when he didn't hear [Ding Xiuxiu]'s "I do" and tugged at [Ding Xiuxiu] in impatience.
1:20:50|1:21:6|[Ding Xiuxiu] turned to look at her mother, tears welling up in her eyes, her mother's face filled with a worried expression at this moment.
1:21:6|1:21:15|[Wang Youzhi] has packed his bags and left home, standing not far from the house waving goodbye to his parents, ready to head to a new city for development.
1:21:15|1:21:26|[Han Ailin] rushed over at this moment. She seemed to say something to [Wang Youzhi], who then quickly dropped his backpack and ran off without looking back.
1:21:26|1:21:34|[Han Ailin] watched as [Wang Youzhi] ran away without any hesitation, and her grief was fully displayed at this moment.
1:21:34|1:21:41|She stood still as tears rolled down her cheeks, knowing that her love was also falling apart.
1:21:41|1:21:46|In the church, [Wang Liang] looked at [Ding Xiuxiu] with tears in her eyes, turned her back on [Ding Xiuxiu], and said coldly.
1:22:23|1:22:45|[Ding Xiuxiu] handed the bouquet to [Li Xiaobao], then quickly grabbed her skirt and ran out of the church, heading towards her own happiness.
1:22:45|1:22:48|Xiaobao watched without looking back, and Ding Xiuxiu was also a person.
1:22:48|1:22:52|[Wang Youzhi] ran to the wedding scene, recalling what [Han Ailin] had just said.
1:24:36|1:24:43|Both of them arrived at the place where the other had just been, only to miss each other once again, unexpectedly both calling each other at the same time.
1:27:4|1:27:12|[Wang Youzhi] and [Ding Xiuxiu] finally met and got married. Meanwhile, [Wang Youzhi]'s college student village official professional cooperative society officially opened amidst the sound of firecrackers.
