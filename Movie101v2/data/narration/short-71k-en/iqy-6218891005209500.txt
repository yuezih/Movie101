0:0:39|0:0:40|On screen, [Ou Yang] rose to fame with the release of the song "Having You in This Lifetime" in 2001. After 2010, [Ou Yang] gradually faded from the music scene, until the winter of 2018.
0:1:20|0:1:37|Drunk and stumbling, [Ou Yang] fell off the sofa in the folk music bar "With You in My Life". Sitting on the stage, [Ou Yang] played the guitar and sang, surrounded by middle-aged people of similar age.
0:2:7|0:2:13|Ou Yang's earphones emitted a piercing sound, and Ou Yang took them out of his ears. The audience below excitedly stood up.
0:2:23|0:2:35|[Ou Yang] took off his sunglasses and walked off the stage, holding a bottle of wine as he approached Yuan Jing sitting in the sofa area.
0:2:42|0:2:44|Yuan Jing took out a business card from her pocket.
0:3:13|0:3:17|[Ou Yang] puts the business card into the pocket on his chest and fills the wine glass.
0:4:0|0:4:4|[Ou Yang] picked up the wine glass and drank it all in one gulp.
0:4:22|0:4:23|Four years ago.
0:4:29|0:4:34|Many people in this school have lofty ideals, perhaps in the political field.
0:4:40|0:4:45|In the charming alley corridor, the young [Ou Yang] framed himself in a picture frame, casting flirtatious glances at passing girls.
0:4:56|0:4:57|[Ou Yang] and his classmates are playing poker in the dormitory.
0:5:8|0:5:11|[Ou Yang] rode his bike through the campus, with [Meng Yifei] catching up.
0:5:11|0:5:13|[Wang Xiaochuan] caught up with them and started playing around.
0:5:27|0:5:40|[Wang Xiaochuan] was reading a book, watching a play, and winning a chess game. Hao Zhiwei stood on the roadside with glasses, waiting for [Ou Yang] to pick him up.
0:5:40|0:5:42|The gender ratio at the school was uneven.
0:6:10|0:6:16|The four of them were holding fake tickets painted by [Ou Yang] for the literary and art performance, ready to exchange them for entry.
0:6:16|0:6:19|The ticket inspector is at the entrance.
0:6:25|0:6:29|Meng Yifei and Wang Xiaochuan nervously pass through the ticket check.
0:6:29|0:6:34|A classmate came up to talk to [Ou Yang].
0:6:34|0:6:40|Hao Zhiwei pushed his way in, leaving [Ou Yang] blocked outside the door in frustration.
0:6:58|0:7:18|[Ou Yang] left carelessly with the business card given by Chen Xiaobin. A girl happened to pass by him, and the two collided. In an instant, Ou Yang's world was enveloped by the bright sunlight, and the title "Always With You 2019" appeared on the screen.
0:7:28|0:7:38|[Ou Yang] pushed his bicycle to the back window of the auditorium, stood on the back seat of the bicycle, climbed through the window into the auditorium.
0:7:38|0:7:42|Hao Zhiwei and [Wang Xiaochuan] were whispering to each other.
0:7:52|0:8:4|The singing performance made the audience burst into laughter, and [Ou Yang] ran over to pat [Meng Yifei] on the shoulder.
0:8:4|0:8:5|They saved a seat for [Ou Yang].
0:8:44|0:8:47|[Ou Yang] clapped his hands while looking around.
0:8:47|0:8:51|At the moment he turned his head, his gaze was caught by the girl on the stage.
0:8:51|0:8:55|He stared fixedly at the girl in a white dress on the stage.
0:8:55|0:9:4|Meng Yifei and Ou Yang next to each other, fighting to use the binoculars to look at the girl on the stage.
0:9:13|0:9:20|[Ou Yang] immersed herself in it with a joyful smile, as if everything around her had nothing to do with her.
0:9:20|0:9:27|In her eyes, there was only the girl on the stage with long black hair, wearing a pristine white dress, and a charming smile.
0:10:13|0:10:18|[Ou Yang] took out a cigarette and held it in his mouth, but couldn't find a lighter.
0:10:18|0:10:28|Yuan Jing took out her own lighter and lit it for him.
0:10:52|0:11:4|The scene shifts back in time, with [Fang Yao] performing on stage.
0:11:4|0:11:10|At the drama club recruitment event, [Ou Yang] was also desperately squeezing through the crowded people to come up with the money to fill out the registration form.
0:11:15|0:11:20|However, they found that the other three roommates were also there, and they went to a small restaurant.
0:11:40|0:11:45|Mr. Li greeted them and gathered them in a small circle to brainstorm ideas.
0:12:14|0:12:16|Others automatically exit.
0:12:21|0:12:23|The four of them raised their hands one after another, ready to use all their skills.
0:12:23|0:12:29|That day, during the day, Hao Zhiwei disguised as a fortune teller and stopped [Fang Yao].
0:12:29|0:12:39|[Wang Xiaochuan] pretends to have a chance encounter.
0:12:39|0:12:47|[Meng Yifei] tampered with the bicycle, preparing to play the hero and save the beauty.
0:12:47|0:12:49|[Wang Xiaochuan] hesitated and pretended to speak English.
0:12:59|0:13:0|Hao Zhiwei was being watched by the security guard.
0:13:8|0:13:25|Meng Yifei's plan was disrupted by Fang Yao, making him furious. Ou Yang came to the art club and hesitated outside the door. Just as he gathered his courage to knock, the door opened from inside and President Li walked out.
0:13:25|0:13:30|[Ou Yang] was forced to be the model for the art club, with President Li guiding him on how to pose.
0:13:35|0:13:41|[Ou Yang] adjusts his posture with his upper body half naked, while his lower body is wrapped in a gray scarf.
0:13:50|0:13:54|President Li reached out to take off the veil, but [Ou Yang] held on tightly.
0:13:54|0:13:57|At the moment when the scarf was torn off, [Fang Yao] pushed the door open.
0:13:59|0:14:5|[Ou Yang]'s plan ended in failure, but he was not ready to give up. He asked Chen Xiaobin, who had previously approached him to draw bus passes, for help.
0:14:5|0:14:7|Ou Yang grabs Chen Xiaobin tightly.
0:14:49|0:14:59|[Ou Yang] walked away with a guitar, while students in the cafeteria were protesting. One student explained the situation to [Ou Yang], and [Wang Xiaochuan] stepped out from the crowd.
0:15:26|0:15:29|[Ou Yang] pushed through the crowd to offer help.
0:15:31|0:15:39|The guitar in hand smashed the glass of the food window, the chef at the food counter stood still, [Ou Yang] pretended to be calm, turned around and glanced at [Fang Yao], stood up straight and said.
0:16:22|0:16:28|Ou Yang walks with a guitar on his back, followed by Fang Yao, along the path in the campus.
0:16:28|0:16:36|[Ou Yang] wanted to strike up a conversation, but lacked the courage.
0:17:28|0:17:30|Chen Xiaobin was chased by a group of girls.
0:17:43|0:17:55|In the dormitory, Ou Yang's photography friends are still planning.
0:17:55|0:18:3|Ou Yang pushed the door open and placed the guitar with Fang Yao's BPG number written on it on the table. The other three looked at each other with expressions of disbelief, while Ou Yang looked at them triumphantly.
0:18:7|0:18:13|The next day, [Ou Yang] with a guitar confronted the band in front of the trial hall and Weiming Lake at Shumu University with the three people in the dormitory.
0:18:13|0:18:21|Chen Xiaobin stood in the middle to mediate, [Ou Yang] spoke first.
0:18:35|0:18:38|[Ou Yang] is ready to start the battle, and Hao Zhiwei stops him.
0:18:38|0:18:40|[Ou Yang] pushed away as Hao Zhiwei grabbed his hand.
0:19:8|0:19:13|They took out playing cards, with the wall behind them covered in posters of the Gambling God.
0:19:13|0:19:18|Ou Yang confronts as the representative of Shuimu University and the representative of the Wei Minghu band.
0:19:18|0:19:24|Chen Xiaobin deals the cards, with the other three teammates from both sides standing behind them cheering.
0:19:24|0:19:30|Both of them each received two cards, with both of them wearing a confident expression on their faces.
0:19:30|0:19:32|In the end, Wei Ming and Hu Le's team revealed all five cards.
0:19:35|0:19:40|Ou Yang and his group proudly left with their guitars, while the band behind them, Wei Minghu Band, discovered something fishy.
0:19:40|0:19:42|Ou Yang, [Meng Yifei], and [Wang Xiaochuan] arrived at the public telephone booth.
0:20:8|0:20:11|[Wang Xiaochuan] said unwillingly.
0:20:20|0:20:28|[Meng Yifei] mocked him, the phone rang, and Ou Yang nervously answered the call.
0:20:29|0:20:41|I am Ou Yang, dedicating a song to you. Wang Xiaochuan holds the microphone while Meng Yifei turns on the prepared recorder.
0:20:41|0:20:45|Ou Yang pretended to play the guitar to the beat and sang into the microphone.
0:21:13|0:21:15|Meng Yifei suddenly turned off the recorder.
0:21:15|0:21:25|Ou Yang looked towards Meng Yifei's gaze as Fang Yao walked over holding the drama club's costumes.
0:21:25|0:21:26|[Fang Yao] approaches.
0:21:34|0:21:38|Back in the dormitory, Ou Yang brought out a book on quick guitar learning methods and started to diligently study the guitar.
0:22:8|0:22:10|Meng Yifei was instantly attracted, interrupted by [Fang Yao] walking over.
0:22:53|0:22:56|[Ou Yang] pulls Meng Yifei away and grabs [Lei Lei]'s hand.
0:23:9|0:23:14|That day, the phone call was answered by me, and [Ou Yang] seemed a bit embarrassed.
0:23:20|0:23:26|Back in the dormitory, [Ou Yang] is practicing the guitar, while [Meng Yifei] is passionately singing along with a pillow in her arms.
0:23:37|0:23:41|[Wang Xiaochuan] and Hao Zhiwei couldn't stand it, so they both plugged their ears, while Meng Yifei patted Ou Yang on the shoulder.
0:23:52|0:23:59|Ou Yang's fingers were scratched by the strings. The next day, he wrapped his fingers in layers of gauze and arrived at the performance hall, which surprised Fang Yao.
0:24:42|0:24:45|As they were about to leave, a classmate ran over.
0:24:51|0:24:55|[Ou Yang] and Meng Yifei both raised their hands, reminded by [Fang Yao].
0:25:6|0:25:8|On stage, [Ou Yang] was slapped.
0:25:16|0:25:20|Lei Lei kept slapping Ou Yang's face one after another, and the director called for a stop.
0:25:43|0:25:47|The props team brought the prop fan onto the stage.
0:25:47|0:25:49|Lei Lei was a little worried as Meng Yifei came running out of breath.
0:26:8|0:26:22|[Ou Yang] looks delighted as [Meng Yifei] runs towards [Lei Lei].
0:26:22|0:26:25|[Fang Yao] stared at the artificial mountain, feeling a bit scared.
0:26:25|0:26:27|Ou Yang looked at her with a worried expression.
0:26:27|0:26:30|In the evening, Ou Yang and Fang Yao stroll on the campus.
0:27:0|0:27:9|[Ou Yang] smiled bitterly, looking up to see a poster of the 5th Beijing Campus Original Song Competition on the wall in front of the dormitory building.
0:27:9|0:27:13|He walked over with Fang Yao.
0:27:17|0:27:28|Ou Yang looked at Fang Yao thoughtfully as a new day began. The sunlight shone through the lush green trees on campus, and a group of people gathered on the path.
0:27:28|0:27:35|Ou Yang and Meng Yifei squeezed through to see what was going on, only to find that it was the Minghu Band performing, so they immediately turned around to leave.
0:28:28|0:28:30|Ou Yang is stopped by [Meng Yifei] despite being foolish.
0:28:48|0:28:52|After the performance of Wei Minghu Band, [Ou Yang] provocatively stared at them.
0:28:52|0:28:59|[Ou Yang] picked up the guitar affectatiously.
0:29:9|0:29:20|Suddenly he turned and saw [Fang Yao] in the crowd, looking disappointed. The drama club's performance officially began, with [Ou Yang] hiding backstage watching [Fang Yao] on stage.
0:29:35|0:29:42|Lei Lei is in tears watching from the audience.
0:29:42|0:29:46|Backstage, [Ou Yang] is getting ready to go on stage.
0:29:46|0:29:54|The director is explaining the scene to [Fang Yao].
0:29:54|0:29:55|Ou Yang remembered what Lei Lei said before.
0:30:0|0:30:8|The final scene is about to be performed.
0:30:8|0:30:14|[Fang Yao] looked up at the tall artificial mountain with fear, and she summoned up the courage to climb up.
0:30:14|0:30:22|The props team laid mats under the artificial hill, [Ou Yang] looked at [Fang Yao] with concern, as [Fang Yao] trembled all over and couldn't stand up.
0:30:24|0:30:29|The hand behind pulled [Fang Yao] down.
0:30:29|0:30:37|The curtain rises, [Ou Yang] wearing a wig and the same outfit as [Fang Yao], replaces [Fang Yao] standing on top of a tall artificial mountain.
0:30:37|0:30:43|At this moment, [Fang Yao] standing behind the scenes noticed a large gap in the protective pad and waved urgently to [Ou Yang].
0:30:50|0:31:0|The music on the scene drowned out his voice, and [Ou Yang] nodded at him.
0:31:0|0:31:11|[Ou Yang] leaped down from the artificial mountain, and the audience below applauded him without noticing.
0:31:11|0:31:15|Da Mu was pulled up, [Ou Yang] was taken to the medical room.
0:31:15|0:31:18|[Fang Yao] stood by [Ou Yang], who suddenly grabbed [Fang Yao]'s hand tightly.
0:31:32|0:31:38|[Ou Yang] suddenly realized that he was holding [Fang Yao]'s hand and quickly let go.
0:31:38|0:31:42|At night, [Ou Yang] and the other three are having supper at a barbecue restaurant. After drinking too much, [Ou Yang] stands up.
0:31:46|0:31:51|[Ou Yang] started to study guitar seriously, preparing to participate in the rural song contest.
0:31:51|0:31:57|He practices diligently, always carrying his guitar with him and practicing playing it non-stop.
0:31:57|0:32:3|Gradually, Fang Yao's roommates no longer find his playing annoying and take out the tissues stuffed in their ears.
0:32:3|0:32:9|Classmates in the same dormitory building also opened their windows to appreciate his performance, applauding and cheering for him.
0:32:12|0:32:15|Meng Yifei also inspired the other three to develop a love for music.
0:32:15|0:32:19|Autumn has passed, and the winter of 1994 has arrived.
0:32:19|0:32:26|[Ou Yang] showed the song he created to his classmates and senior sister, applying to participate in the New Year's Eve performance.
0:32:42|0:32:52|When Ou Yang was in distress, the door of Li Jian's office opened and Gao Xiaosong walked out.
0:32:52|0:32:53|[Ou Yang] Stop him.
0:33:12|0:33:16|[Ou Yang] handed over his lyrics and music to Gao Xiaosong before turning and leaving.
0:33:16|0:33:19|In the dormitory, [Meng Yifei] and two others were thinking of a mischievous plan.
0:33:40|0:33:43|They took out four pills in preparation for the New Year's Eve operation.
0:33:43|0:33:53|The New Year's dance has begun, with the hall decorated with lights and decorations. [Ou Yang] and [Fang Yao] are dancing along with the crowd.
0:33:53|0:33:57|[Meng Yifei] is confessing his love to [Lei Lei].
0:33:57|0:34:1|Hao Zhiwei and [Wang Xiaochuan] danced wildly in the crowd, with [Fang Yao] excitedly talking to [Ou Yang].
0:34:9|0:34:14|[Ou Yang] smiled and [Meng Yifei] took the opportunity while everyone was having a great time to put the pills into the beer.
0:34:14|0:34:24|He walked up to Gao Xiaosong with a beer bottle and [Wang Xiaochuan].
0:34:24|0:34:26|[Wang Xiaochuan] pretends to cry on the side.
0:34:32|0:34:39|Gao Xiaosong took the bottle of wine.
0:34:46|0:34:53|Meng Yifei awkwardly smiles after snatching the bottle from Gao Xiaosong's mouth.
0:34:57|0:34:59|Ou Yang has contacted Gao Xiaosong again.
0:35:46|0:36:9|Ou Yang looked at the girls in the audience, while Fang Yao also smiled quietly and listened.
0:36:9|0:36:11|Everyone listens to the song and counts down to the arrival of the new year.
0:36:24|0:36:34|[Fang Yao] turned around excitedly and hugged [Ou Yang]. [Ou Yang] stood still, feeling a bit at a loss, a bit joyful, and a bit shy.
0:36:34|0:36:42|[Ou Yang] came out holding a guitar and sat on the steps of the street with colorful lights with [Fang Yao].
0:36:42|0:36:46|[Fang Yao] is slightly tipsy.
0:36:55|0:37:5|[Ou Yang] said nothing, just stared fixedly at the girl sitting next to her.
0:37:5|0:37:13|She gradually started strumming the guitar with the [Fang Yao] BP mark on it.
0:37:13|0:37:16|[Fang Yao] leaned slowly on her shoulder in a daze.
0:37:21|0:37:30|Snowflakes fell from the sky, shining crystal clear under the light.
0:37:30|0:37:41|Ou Yang glanced at Fang Yao leaning on his shoulder, feeling both excited and nervous. He didn't dare to move at all, afraid of waking her up.
0:37:46|0:37:54|Unable to contain himself, he couldn't resist turning his head and, with a nervous heart, slowly kissed [Fang Yao]'s lips.
0:38:2|0:38:19|In the distance, the sound of fireworks woke up [Fang Yao]. [Ou Yang] sat up nervously, [Fang Yao] rubbed her eyes sleepily, and the brilliant fireworks bloomed in the sky, illuminating the night.
0:38:19|0:38:27|[Fang Yao] raised her hand to catch the falling snowflakes, wearing an exquisite bracelet on her wrist, while [Ou Yang] gazed at her intently.
0:39:45|0:39:53|The scene returns to the basketball court in the past! [Meng Yifei] proudly raises his head!
0:40:1|0:40:16|Mo Yifei began to recall, she kissed [Lei Lei] forcefully, got slapped, then she held [Lei Lei]'s face and kissed fiercely again, and received another slap on her face.
0:40:16|0:40:17|Female dormitory.
0:41:0|0:41:4|[Ou Yang] plans to form a band with three other roommates to participate in the campus song competition.
0:41:11|0:41:12|[Ou Yang] was writing songs in the internship design studio when he was discovered by the teacher.
0:41:34|0:41:38|[Ou Yang] hurriedly put away the paper, but accidentally spilled the water glass on the table.
0:41:38|0:41:43|After finishing their internship in the evening, they gathered in the practice room for overtime practice.
0:41:43|0:41:48|The 16th on the calendar is marked, it's [Fang Yao]'s birthday.
0:41:48|0:41:51|Ou Yang carved a small wooden sculpture with the likeness of Fang Yao.
0:41:51|0:41:55|Hao Zhiwei always carries two wooden sticks to practice the drum kit anytime, anywhere.
0:41:55|0:42:0|Wang Xiaochuan's fingers danced, immersed in the notes, passing the day in a daze.
0:42:2|0:42:21|[Meng Yifei] stood on the street watching the old man playing the three-stringed instrument. In their final days on campus, they freely indulged in their youth, giving their all towards their musical dreams.
0:42:21|0:42:25|They finally stepped onto the stage of the preliminary round of the 5th Beijing Campus Song Competition.
0:42:37|0:42:50|[Ou Yang] sat at the table playing the guitar and writing a song. The birthday gift he carefully prepared for [Fang Yao] was a music box with a wooden figurine of [Fang Yao] that spins.
0:42:50|0:42:56|On [Fang Yao]'s birthday, he prepared a birthday surprise for [Fang Yao] in the drama club.
0:42:56|0:43:1|[Fang Yao] pushed open the door of the drama club, and the room immediately lit up.
0:43:1|0:43:6|Ou Yang starts singing the birthday song, while other classmates appear one after another holding cakes and throwing confetti.
0:43:19|0:43:26|Ou Yang walked up to [Fang Yao] and handed her the music box.
0:43:26|0:43:30|[Fang Yao] moved to tears, hugged Ou Yang tightly, and Ou Yang also held her tightly.
0:43:36|0:43:46|The two of them started to be inseparable, on the small paths of the campus, under the big tree on the lawn, everywhere was filled with their sweet and deep affection.
0:43:46|0:43:53|Meng Yifei sat nervously on a stone bench holding a bag of snacks, waiting for Lei Lei. When Lei Lei approached, he quickly stood up.
0:43:59|0:44:5|She handed the snacks to [Lei Lei], who was about to leave, but she quickly stopped her.
0:44:16|0:44:25|He took out a can of soda from the bag, pulled the ring tab, and wiped it on himself.
0:44:25|0:44:37|[Lei Lei] hesitated for a moment, then threw the pull tab ring far away before leaving angrily.
0:44:39|0:44:51|In the summer of 1995, Fang Yao was practicing English lines in the rehearsal hall when Ou Yang walked over with an envelope and patted her on the shoulder, speaking in English as well.
0:44:58|0:45:2|[Fang Yao] excitedly took the envelope and opened it to read.
0:45:7|0:45:8|Ou Yang excitedly embraces Fang Yao.
0:45:8|0:45:8|[Fang Yao] suddenly looked serious, and Ou Yang comforted her.
0:45:57|0:46:2|Ou Yang stood still in place, his brows furrowed, at a loss and trying to appear calm.
0:46:24|0:46:28|Ou Yang looked despondent as the scene cut back to the folk bar.
0:46:28|0:46:31|Ou Yang lit a cigarette and looked at the mirror in front of him.
0:46:58|0:47:0|Young Ou Yang chased after the car of [Fang Yao] and shouted loudly.
0:47:8|0:47:12|He chased through one intersection after another, the taxi getting further and further away.
0:47:12|0:47:17|[Fang Yao] sat in the car, not daring to look back, tears streaming down her face.
0:47:17|0:47:23|Ou Yang stood at the intersection, panting heavily, watching helplessly as his lover walked away.
0:47:23|0:47:30|Back at the bar, middle-aged Ou Yang staggered to a corner of the wall covered with guitars.
0:48:2|0:48:18|On the paper was written the first line of a song with you in it. Because I dreamt of you leaving, I woke up from my sleep, and he remembered the poem that [Fang Yao] once recited, admiring the time of your youthful joy.
0:48:25|0:48:31|She still saw the beautiful girl in a white dress on the stage.
0:49:4|0:49:5|He finished the drink in his cup in one gulp.
0:49:33|0:49:33|Ou Yang turned around slowly.
0:50:53|0:51:25|You tell me, [Ou Yang] speaks the truth, why didn't you participate? There's no need for so many explanations, I was locked up. Why does [Ou Yang] get impatient when he puts on sunglasses and takes them off? I admit I lied, there aren't so many little emotions in my story. It's still that snowy New Year's Eve, Fang Yao reaches out to catch the falling snowflakes.
0:51:25|0:51:39|[Ou Yang] gazed at her affectionately with his guitar in his arms.
0:52:9|0:52:20|[Fang Yao] was lost in memories, when three knife-wielding robbers approached them in the apartment where [Fang Yao] was putting on a bracelet for [Fang Yao].
0:52:20|0:52:22|[Fang Yao] returned to the apartment with the police, who was injured.
0:52:27|0:52:33|The hand in the apartment tightly holding the bracelet is covered in blood.
0:52:33|0:52:38|[Ou Yang] remained silent at [Fang Yao]'s birthday party.
0:53:1|0:53:11|Ou Yang was about to confess his feelings when a hand was placed on Fang Yao's shoulder.
0:53:11|0:53:14|[Ou Yang] stood still with red eyes.
0:53:34|0:53:40|[Ou Yang] was feeling complicated, and the music box hidden behind him was never taken out.
0:53:40|0:53:45|Returning to the dormitory at night.
0:53:52|0:53:55|[Ou Yang] lay silently on the bed, while [Meng Yifei] ran back panting.
0:54:5|0:54:9|[Ou Yang] leaped out of bed, ready to rush out the door, but was stopped by [Meng Yifei].
0:54:10|0:54:12|Picking up the music box made for [Fang Yao] on the table, she looked at it intently.
0:54:12|0:54:12|The next day, Ou Yang went to find Fang Yao and saw Wang Xiaochuan also looking for Fang Yao from a distance.
0:54:36|0:54:44|[Fang Yao] and [Wang Xiaochuan] left, with [Ou Yang] quietly following them.
0:54:47|0:54:52|Seeing [Wang Xiaochuan] temporarily leave, [Ou Yang] caught up with him.
0:54:52|0:54:55|Before finishing calling out [Fang Yao]'s name, [Ou Yang] came back.
0:54:55|0:54:58|[Ou Yang] quickly hid behind the car parked on the side.
0:55:15|0:55:30|[Ou Yang] climbed out from under the car with a music box in his hand. He stood up, took a few steps forward, and approached to see that Gong Yu and [Fang Yao] had entered a hotel called Wudaokou.
0:55:34|0:55:56|[Ou Yang], feeling disheartened, slowly regained his composure. He turned around and looked at the music box in his hand, then placed it on the nearby car.
0:55:56|0:56:2|In a small restaurant, [Ou Yang] sat alone at a table, drinking heavily. Beside him, the lead singer of the Wei Ming Lake band and his girlfriend were having a quarrel.
0:56:32|0:56:42|Ou Yang stands up and throws a punch.
0:56:42|0:56:49|[Ou Yang] was kicked to the ground and received a beating of punches and kicks.
0:56:49|0:56:55|Meng Yifei and his companions rushing over from a distance quickly stepped forward to help, and the two groups started fighting.
0:56:55|0:56:57|The table in the restaurant was overturned, and onlookers were too scared to intervene.
0:57:9|0:57:15|[Ou Yang] vented his anger, kicking the lead singer on the table leg, and the bottle on the table smashed on the lead singer's head.
0:57:31|0:57:38|On the notice board is [Ou Yang]'s dismissal notice. That night, [Ou Yang] walked in the pouring rain with a guitar on his back, feeling utterly dejected.
0:57:38|0:57:49|The rain soaked him through, as he recalled Ou Yang's appearance at the birthday party, Fang Yao following Ou Yang into the hotel. He stopped in his tracks, letting the pouring rain beat down on him.
0:57:51|0:57:59|He took off the extraordinary guitar on his back, looking sorrowful, tears mingling with the rain.
0:57:59|0:58:12|He angrily raised the guitar and smashed it repeatedly against the street lamp post with all his strength, leaving the shattered guitar abandoned by the roadside.
0:58:12|0:58:17|The rain stopped, and the drenched Ou Yang leaned against the wall.
0:59:43|0:59:46|Meng Yifei's face was also covered in tears.
0:59:56|1:0:0|The scene goes back to the day when Ou Yang went to find Fang Yao.
1:0:2|1:0:4|[Wang Xiaochuan] comes to find [Fang Yao].
1:0:34|1:0:43|They arrived at the entrance of the Wudao Kou Hotel.
1:0:43|1:0:48|[Ou Yang] chased after [Gong Yu] after she left.
1:0:48|1:0:50|[Fang Yao] turned around to investigate the sound she heard.
1:1:8|1:1:10|Wind and rain.
1:1:19|1:1:22|[Fang Yao] and [Wang Xiaochuan] walk into the lobby of the hotel.
1:1:22|1:1:24|[Fang Yao] stopped [Wang Xiaochuan] from continuing to walk inside.
1:2:15|1:2:17|[Fang Yao] rejected [Wang Xiaochuan]'s attempt to put his hand on her shoulder.
1:2:26|1:2:30|[Fang Yao] turned and walked away.
1:2:30|1:2:38|[Fang Yao] walked out of the hotel and saw the music box placed on the car by [Ou Yang].
1:2:38|1:2:46|On top is a small note given by [Ou Yang].
1:2:46|1:2:49|In the bar, [Ou Yang] is surprised by Yuan Jing's story.
1:2:52|1:3:2|He stared in shock at the round mirror, tears glistening in the eyes of the mirror.
1:3:23|1:3:29|Ou Yang picked up the bottle of wine, sipped it with a smile, and pointed at [Fang Yao], unsure of what to say.
1:3:29|1:3:41|Fang Yao looked at the man in front of her with deep affection, tears already streaming down her face.
1:5:31|1:5:35|Yuan Jing's tears had already made up their mind.
1:5:49|1:5:53|In the past, [Fang Yao] sat on the bed in the dormitory, absent-minded, while [Lei Lei] looked a bit worried.
1:6:26|1:6:31|Fang Yao's gaze gradually shifted to the music box given by Ou Yang on the table.
1:6:31|1:6:32|She walked to the table and gently touched the figurine on the music box, which was playing a haunting melody.
1:6:53|1:7:2|He pulled open the small drawer of the music box and took out the note inside.
1:7:2|1:7:5|The note reads.
1:7:9|1:7:11|[Fang Yao] ran to the bottom of the boys' dormitory building.
1:7:25|1:7:31|[Fang Yao] was a bit anxious as she ran to the public telephone booth.
1:8:0|1:8:15|[Fang Yao] choked up and couldn't speak. She didn't know where to start or what to say.
1:8:15|1:8:19|Tears welled up in her eyes as she struggled to speak time and time again.
1:8:23|1:8:28|[Fang Yao] cried, hung up the phone, and ran away.
1:8:28|1:8:32|[Fang Yao] later went abroad.
1:9:35|1:9:38|[Ou Yang] took a sip from the bottle and stood up.
1:10:3|1:10:12|If [Ou Yang] had known that Fang Yao didn't stay overnight with Gong Yu, would he have not started the fight?
1:10:21|1:10:34|Yuan Jing smiled at [Ou Yang] and he stood up.
1:10:34|1:10:39|In the security office that year, the security guard took out four pieces of paper and pens.
1:10:45|1:10:46|The security guard turned and walked out of the security room.
1:11:18|1:11:25|Lei Lei runs back to the dormitory.
1:11:25|1:11:29|The final of the singing competition is about to begin.
1:11:29|1:11:30|In the security room.
1:12:21|1:12:29|[Meng Yifei] picked up a broom to play the bass, Hao Zhiwei sat at the table with a pen, while [Wang Xiaochuan]'s fingers danced on the table.
1:12:34|1:12:45|They happily immersed themselves in their own world of music, and [Ou Yang] smiled with emotion, his gaze fixed on the paper on the table with the lyrics of a song written by you.
1:12:45|1:12:47|He picked up the paper, his gaze becoming determined.
1:13:5|1:13:14|[Ou Yang] climbed up to the security room window, stuck his head out and prepared to climb out.
1:13:14|1:13:21|[Ou Yang] is trying hard to overcome fear, while the other three are inside, pulling tight the rope tied around [Ou Yang]'s waist with a jacket.
1:13:25|1:13:34|[Ou Yang] tried to stand up straight and reach the rooftop with both hands.
1:13:34|1:13:39|[Meng Yifei] held onto [Ou Yang]'s feet and pushed upwards, while [Ou Yang] grabbed the edge of the rooftop.
1:13:43|1:14:2|[Fang Yao] grabbed [Ou Yang]'s hand and pulled him up with all her strength, while [Lei Lei] below was pulling [Ou Yang] with all her might. With the combined effort of several people, a tremendous amount of energy was unleashed.
1:14:2|1:14:6|[Ou Yang] exerted all his strength and finally climbed up to the rooftop.
1:14:9|1:14:21|Hao Zhiwei slowly loosened the rope, and Ou Yang lay down exhausted on the rooftop.
1:14:28|1:14:32|[Fang Yao] was amused by his anxious look and took out a guitar from behind.
1:14:37|1:14:52|Ou Yang took the guitar with the Daman patch and smiled at Fang Yao.
1:14:52|1:14:56|Ou Yang pulled Fang Yao out, with the other three following closely behind, while the security guards chased after them.
1:15:23|1:15:29|They ran all the way to the finals venue and encountered the Wei Minghu band.
1:15:29|1:15:29|The security guard caught up.
1:15:42|1:15:56|The Wei Minghu band helped them stop the security guards.
1:15:56|1:16:1|They quickly went on stage to prepare, [Ou Yang] looked at [Fang Yao], wanting to say something but unable to speak.
1:16:6|1:16:16|[Ou Yang] ran onto the stage with a guitar on his back, recalling the dream he once shared with [Fang Yao].
1:16:50|1:16:56|On stage, [Ou Yang] mustered up the courage.
1:17:19|1:17:25|At a folk music bar with your presence, [Ou Yang] picked up the old guitar.
1:17:25|1:17:31|Fang Yao stood in the audience, while the young Ou Yang sang this touching song on stage.
1:17:44|1:18:1|On screen, the eras of Ou Yang and young Ou Yang intertwine, and both the present Fang Yao and the past are deeply moved by the song.
1:18:26|1:18:34|[Lei Lei] put the crown on Little Paper and waved to show it to [Meng Yifei], while the judges were also immersed in this heartwarming song.
1:18:57|1:19:8|On a night of pouring rain, after [Ou Yang] left, [Fang Yao] picked up the abandoned guitar with an umbrella and carefully repaired it.
1:19:8|1:19:14|The sweet scenes that [Ou Yang] had imagined before related to [Fang Yao] are playing out again.
1:19:14|1:19:20|In this story, [Ou Yang] loves [Fang Yao], and [Fang Yao]'s heart has long been given to [Ou Yang].
1:19:25|1:19:33|On the stage, [Ou Yang] shines brightly, in Fang Yao's eyes, in the round mirror's eyes, there are memories of [Ou Yang] from different periods.
1:20:12|1:20:26|Time rewinds, all stories start over, everything returns to the beginning, back to that heartbreaking rainy night, back to the initial encounter, back to the heart-pounding collision in front of the auditorium.
1:20:35|1:20:42|The ending has already been changed, at this moment [Ou Yang] at the bar only has earthly desires in his eyes.
1:20:42|1:20:47|On the stage of the song contest finals, [Ou Yang] only has eyes for [Fang Yao].
1:20:51|1:20:57|All the love and friendship become even more touching at this moment.
1:20:59|1:21:8|In his student days, [Ou Yang] was slightly rebellious under the moonlight, but in his middle age, [Ou Yang] confidently headed towards the distance.
1:21:35|1:21:43|The ventilation fan in the bar is spinning, and the sunlight is shining through the blades onto the table.
1:21:43|1:21:52|[Ou Yang] wakes up groggily.
1:21:52|1:22:2|He left the sofa, stood up, and turned to look at the old guitar hanging on the wall.
1:22:5|1:22:31|Picking up the bottle of wine on the table, he unscrewed the cap. Just before he was about to drink it, he put the bottle down again.
1:22:31|1:22:34|He walked towards the big door shining with bright sunlight.
