0:2:56|0:3:10|After bowing and taking his leave, the scene shifts to a misty rain setting, where [Yang Cang] is already standing outside the [Pei State Governor's Mansion]. The mansion is built against the mountains, nestled among the rocks, with mountains at its back and water surrounding it, presenting a formidable defensive position.
0:3:10|0:3:25|In the palace hall, a young girl and a woman sat on either side of the hanging platform. The woman remained silent, picking up coins and tossing them into a tortoise shell, then swaying it in front of her forehead.
0:4:7|0:4:14|The girl called out to [Pei Liang] behind the screen. The girl, named [Qing Ping], is the eldest princess of [Pei].
0:5:0|0:5:6|[Pei Liang] stood in the center of the court, pointing a finger at the Grand Commander [Ziyu]. Seeing him not responding, he actually condescended to step forward.
0:5:59|0:6:8|The spacious court echoed with lingering sounds, as the wind passed through the hall, causing the hair on the temples of the crowd to sway with the intense atmosphere of the moment.
0:7:24|0:7:36|Qing Ping raised her hand and with a wave, a rustling sound was heard in the hall. In a moment, a zither and a lute were placed in front of everyone. It was then known that the woman was actually the Grand Marshal of Pei Kingdom, Ziyu's wife, named Xiaoai.
0:7:36|0:7:51|[Pei Liang] bent down to gently stroke the strings of the qin, then gestured towards [Ziyu] and spoke of the golden words of a sovereign, as a subject, one should respect and honor the imperial will.
0:7:51|0:8:10|Despite [Pei Liang]'s repeated requests, this couple remains unmoved. Beside them, [Yang Cang] stands with a bowed head, and upon seeing [Xiaoai] already seated in front of the ancient altar, he softly persuades.
0:8:10|0:8:23|[Ziyu], standing still, with a stern look in his eyes, stood in front of everyone with his hands behind his back. Although not wearing armor, the chilling aura of long-term high status still made people shudder.
0:8:23|0:8:27|After much consideration, Ziyu finally walked slowly to Xiaoai's side and sat down.
0:8:28|0:8:35|Pei Liang also breathed a sigh of relief, standing in front of the couple in a long robe, listening attentively.
0:9:2|0:9:8|Pei Liang chuckled at the banter and crouched in front of Xiaoai.
0:9:31|0:9:42|Qing Ping finished speaking and turned to leave. The four people in the hall seemed to be in a trance, their bodies motionless, only the incense burner next to [Xiaoai] emitting blue smoke. Plucking the strings with her fingers, the sound of the silver bottle breaking, the zither playing the Seven-character-quatrain.
0:10:2|0:10:10|After the guqin, [Ziyu] remained sitting upright, showing no intention of playing the instrument.
0:10:19|0:10:28|In the midst of the chaos, Xiaoai unexpectedly snatched the bowstring knife and, panting, swung it towards her own hand.
0:10:30|0:10:39|[Ziyu] turned over and grabbed his wife's wrist, saying as he took the string knife off and held it in his hand, then he turned his head and said.
0:10:43|0:11:10|The sharp blade edge, too late to stop, the cut hair has fallen onto the strings. It is said that the body's skin and hair are given by the parents, and one dare not destroy or harm it, which is the beginning of filial piety. What is done today is first to disregard the distinction between ruler and subject, and then to not adhere to the proprieties and laws of kinship and seniority.
0:12:14|0:12:39|Lu Yan immediately leaned in to listen to [Pei Liang] beside him as he watched Lu Yan bow and leave. There was a hint of coldness in [Pei Liang]'s eyes, completely different from the previous debauched and incompetent king. The scene shifted to the Governor's Mansion, which was completely different from the surrounding mountains and waters. Inside the mansion, there were numerous screens, with dim lighting and shadows. Walking between pavilions and rooms, [Xiaoai], as the mistress of a prestigious family, was unexpectedly guarded, coming alone to a side hall.
0:12:39|0:12:53|In front of the wall painted with a picture of the Qing Song River water and strange rocks, [Xiaoai] confirmed that there was no one around, then she squatted down and skillfully opened the mechanism controlling the wall. With a light push of her palm on the strange rock picture, the wall slightly popped outwards, revealing a secret passage behind.
0:12:53|0:13:10|[Xiaoai] walked in sideways, and the outer wall returned to its original state. The secret passage was deep and dark, without any candles, but there was a faint light shining down from above, indicating that it was a hidden and narrow passage in the mountains where the Governor's Mansion was located. The passage led to a cave.
0:13:10|0:13:16|Two men sat cross-legged on the platform with their bare chests. Looking closely, they both had the face of [Ziyu].
0:13:16|0:13:22|One person is strong, the other is weak.
0:13:47|0:14:2|Without discussing the identities of the two, the weak [Ziyu] repeatedly wielded the knife on the robust [Ziyu]'s chest. The person being cut by the knife showed no resistance at all. This alone is enough to be shocking. The tip of the knife stained with blood, the robust [Ziyu] was already in so much pain that he couldn't speak.
0:14:11|0:14:18|Ziyu, weak and feeble, applied the ointment to the wound, only to hear a scream of pain.
0:15:10|0:15:26|A series of wheezing sounds like an old bellows, the frail Ziyu seemed to be weak as if suffering from a serious illness. He immersed his hands in a copper basin, washing away the bloodstains.
0:15:51|0:16:9|Frail [Ziyu] fiercely smashed the towel into the basin, splashing water everywhere. Then, staring at the person in front of him panting heavily, the scene shifted and the two were separated. Frail [Ziyu] sat under the stone wall, with a Tai Chi Yin Yang disc in front of him, holding black and white pieces, contemplating. Meanwhile, [Xiaoai] was tending to the wounds of the burly [Ziyu].
0:16:9|0:16:16|The two bodies were close, and their eyes met, both feeling a bit flustered.
0:16:19|0:16:25|Ziyu, who was weak and coughing, attracted Xiaoai to come to his side.
0:16:48|0:16:55|After a few words, one can understand that the weak one is the commander, while the strong one is just a fake Ziyu replaced by Jingzhou.
0:16:58|0:17:6|Upon hearing these words, [Jingzhou] looked at the commander in front of him, who repeated them resolutely. [Ziyu] with disheveled hair looked at [Jingzhou] and nodded vigorously.
0:17:26|0:17:43|He did not answer as [Jingzhou] reached out to help [Xiaoai] down. He walked over to [Jingzhou], only to see him dressed in a black robe that covered his entire body, almost blending in with the dark cave walls. He slightly bowed his body, his gaze coldly fixed on [Jingzhou].
0:17:49|0:17:57|[Ziyu] placed his hand on [Jingzhou]'s shoulder to show his concern. When there was no more bleeding on [Jingzhou]'s chest,
0:17:57|0:18:3|After Xiaoai helped Ziyu lie down to rest, the two of them left the secret room one after the other.
0:18:3|0:18:17|In the Prefectural Government Office, the zither and the se are playing in harmony. Following Ziyu's instructions, Xiaoai begins to guide Jingzhou in playing the zither. Jingzhou by his side does not understand the meaning, just looks at Xiaoai sideways. Seeing this, Xiaoai gets up and sits closer.
0:18:22|0:18:34|While plucking the strings and adjusting the knobs, he did not notice that [Jingzhou] was not looking at the zither, but at the mistress.
0:18:42|0:18:46|After the sound editing, Xiaoai cast a demure glance at Jingzhou sitting in front of the zither. Jingzhou withdrew his gaze, not daring to show any disrespect.
0:18:46|0:18:54|But always feeling the warmth on the clothes.
0:19:0|0:19:21|The so-called harmony of qin and se, mutual understanding, although this duet does not have such skill, under the mutual resonance, it has also brought the distance between the two closer. At the entrance of the secret passage, [Ziyu] changed into a white robe, standing under the narrow and dangerous place, the mountain wind blowing, his hair flying like rain.
0:19:21|0:19:38|[Jingzhou] is not proficient in music, but [Ziyu] and [Xiaoai] are in perfect harmony. Even in the fighting room, [Ziyu] can still feel the distant sound of the qin. His eyes are sharp, yet filled with coldness, as if he can see through the walls and stare at the two outside.
0:19:38|0:19:50|As night fell, the already dim Governor's Mansion felt even more gloomy, with only a few bamboo lamps struggling to emit light. Fortunately, the cold moonlight seeped through the curtains and draped over the furnishings in the mansion, revealing a desolate atmosphere.
0:19:52|0:20:7|In the interior, [Xiaoai] and [Jingzhou] undressed and sat in front of the screen behind the bed. Two maids spread out the bedding and then left without looking back. When they were far away, and there was no one else in the room, [Jingzhou] cautiously took a glance.
0:20:7|0:20:26|Shortly after, [Xiaoai] stood up and bowed to show respect, and [Xiaoai] nodded slightly in response. The two of them had been sleeping separately for over a year without anyone in the mansion knowing. [Jingzhou] left the attendants and walked into the courtyard, skillfully pulling out bedding from the corner.
0:20:26|0:20:32|Next to a bamboo lamp in the corridor, [Ziyu] lay down on the ground, gently touching his chest soaked with ointment and fell asleep.
0:20:32|0:20:45|During this time, [Xiaoai] gazed through the light gauze canopy with her beautiful eyes, the moonlight reflecting in them like water flowing down to earth. On the screen, clusters of snow plum blossoms were hidden among the green bamboo.
0:20:45|0:20:52|However, this beautiful scenery is no match for the beauty of [Xiaoai], who is as delicate as powder and as pure as snow.
0:20:52|0:20:59|She looked at [Jingzhou] with a look of concern in her eyes. The moonlight gently draped over [Xiaoai]'s cheeks.
0:20:59|0:21:8|With a calm demeanor tinged with a hint of sorrow, it can be said that Ziyu is like the moonlight gently washing over the green silk, with a perpetual elegance in his furrowed brows and bright eyes.
0:21:8|0:21:17|Seeing her husband becoming increasingly obsessed and crazy due to his inner convictions, there was also someone by her side who bore a striking resemblance to [Ziyu], the extraordinary [Jingzhou].
0:21:17|0:21:22|Xiaoai, time passes like flowers, but dare not act on the spring heart.
0:21:24|0:21:31|In the morning, two maidservants changed into court attire for [Jingzhou] and were sent out, leaving only him and [Xiaoai] in the room.
0:21:31|0:21:39|[Jingzhou] looked majestic, and when he saw [Xiaoai], he seemed a bit stunned. She walked slowly to [Jingzhou]'s side and took out something from her sleeve.
0:21:45|0:21:51|After Xiaoai finished speaking, she took Jingzhou's hand and placed a plain silk sachet embroidered with three clusters of white plum blossoms and flowing cloud patterns in his palm.
0:22:12|0:22:20|Turning his head, Xiaoai looked at Jingzhou for a while before speaking.
0:22:34|0:22:39|Upon hearing this, [Jingzhou] slumped onto the table, his eyes unfocused, and began to speak.
0:23:47|0:23:54|[Jingzhou] spoke with a heavy heart, and [Xiaoai] felt uncomfortable listening, so she gently placed her slender hand on his shoulder.
0:24:5|0:24:13|Under the command of [Jingzhou], the pent-up emotions in his heart seemed to dissipate, feeling the warmth beside him. He daringly rested his head gently on the chest of the person next to him.
0:24:14|0:24:24|[Xiaoai], a few years older than him, has watched him grow up since he entered the mansion of [Jingzhou]. At this moment, she couldn't help but feel a sense of pity in her heart, so she let him be reckless this time.
0:24:24|0:24:33|Holding onto [Jingzhou] in a daze, he unexpectedly embraced [Xiaoai] around the waist and hips, startling him to immediately push away. [Xiaoai] turned around, leaving behind a waist-length hair.
0:24:33|0:24:40|The scene shifts to outside the Pei Kingdom palace, where civil and military officials are disembarking from two boats one after another.
0:24:40|0:24:52|In the midst of wind and rain, everyone stood in line on the platform outside the hall, as if they were already accustomed to it, the continuous rain in the Pei Kingdom. [Pei Liang] sat in the main seat of the hall, with a strong physique,
0:24:52|0:24:55|The words spoken were filled with laziness and indifference.
0:25:24|0:25:30|Lu Yan listened, bowed and stood beside [Jingzhou], and said.
0:25:44|0:25:50|Tian Zhan drove away four palace eunuchs and bowed to the palace from a distance.
0:25:52|0:26:12|Led by him, the civil and military officials pleaded with [Pei Liang] to withdraw the decree, but [Jingzhou] stood up straight and opened his arms. Then four eunuchs behind him stepped forward to take the seal from his waist, remove the court cap from his neck, and help him out of his armor and long robe, not long after.
0:26:12|0:26:19|With only a shabby robe left, [Pei Liang] stood alone in the court, overlooking the officials and slowly spoke.
0:27:0|0:27:23|Jingzhou, who was already leaving in plain clothes, was stopped by Pei Liang calling out Qing Ping to stop her mischief. Pei Liang, with his clothes hanging like ink, walked towards Jingzhou. As he walked down the steps with his head lowered, he began to speak.
0:28:4|0:28:19|[Pei Liang] presented himself with the majesty of an emperor in this debate, causing a stir among the civil and military officials in the court. [Qing Ping], clad in armor, stood behind a folding screen, furrowing her brows as she watched her brother [Jingzhou] in a difficult situation.
0:28:24|0:28:48|[Jingzhou] removed the bandages from his body, revealing the chest wound, the wound of the Governor is the wound of the State of [Pei Liang]. After saying this, [Pei Liang] used a silver spoon to scoop up the ointment from the bottle and approached the bare back of [Jingzhou], focusing intently on the wound without looking away. However, the spoon in his hand hesitated to apply the ointment to the wound. [Pei Liang] then questioned:
0:28:52|0:29:4|Upon hearing these words, the officials were shocked. The Yang family's knife skills were powerful and fierce, and those who were injured by their knives were all unable to resist their dominance. If it weren't for extraordinary talent, the wounds would never have healed on their own.
0:29:50|0:30:1|Hearing the former top general's words, [Pei Liang] was burning with anger, his face turning extremely grim. [Jingzhou] then put on sacrilegious clothing and left decisively, leaving the civil and military officials stunned.
0:30:1|0:30:14|Pei Liang, the dignified ruler of a country, was unexpectedly ignored by him in the court, throwing the ointment into Lu Yan's hands. [Pei Liang] then turned around and faced away from the courtiers, looking at his own throne, with a fiery gaze in his eyes.
0:30:16|0:30:22|The misty rain drifts, the river is wide, and under the tranquility, there always seems to be an undercurrent surging within.
0:30:22|0:30:45|[Jingzhou] lay in the cabin of the blackwood boat, his sacrificial robe stained with blood. Opening the sachet given by [Xiaoai], he applied the medicinal powder to his wound. The powder dissolved in the blood, causing excruciating pain. Even the seven-foot-tall [Jingzhou] couldn't help but cry out in pain. When the effects of the medicine wore off, he was drenched in sweat. Nevertheless, [Jingzhou] continued to support himself, caressing the sachet given by [Xiaoai].
0:31:3|0:31:11|In the secret room, the warmth of the candlelight reflected on Xiaoai's face as she listened to Ziyu's words, but her expression turned suddenly pale.
0:31:19|0:31:28|In the grand hall, fine silk hung from the beams and lay on the ground, with the newly written "Ode to Peace" displayed. The majestic and powerful strokes of the brush depicted dragons and snakes, truly extraordinary when observing the ink masterpiece of [Pei Liang].
0:32:3|0:32:21|The brother and sister stood on either side of the screen, locking eyes. [Qing Ping] suddenly felt that she had never been so estranged from her brother. The scene then shifted to the Tai Chi battle formation in the secret chamber.
0:32:35|0:32:51|[Ziyu] and [Jingzhou] stood in the center of the Yin-Yang formation, while [Xiaoai] solemnly held an umbrella outside the formation. With a half-height bamboo pole in hand, [Ziyu] waved it, causing numerous splashes of water in the formation. Facing him, [Jingzhou] held a mysterious umbrella in front of him for defense. Without hesitation, [Ziyu] moved forward, the bamboo pole collided with the umbrella, creating a sound like muffled thunder.
0:32:55|0:33:17|With just three moves, [Jingzhou] has already forced [Ziyu] back ten steps, feeling unsettled. After speaking, he uses a long pole as a staff, walking back to the center of the Yang Fish Formation, inhaling like the wind and exhaling like a crack, intending to break [Yang Cang]'s sword technique and find a way to defeat the enemy. When the two of them stand still, [Jingzhou] advances with his umbrella, reversing the attack and defense. Only [Ziyu] is seen wielding a bamboo staff as a blue blade, opening and closing it widely.
0:33:17|0:33:25|With the momentum of a fierce tiger, in a matter of moments [Jingzhou] was overturned to the ground, leaving [Ziyu] struggling to stand with shortness of breath.
0:33:42|0:34:0|[Ziyu] was seen going crazy, cutting off his arm and pushing away his wife to rush towards [Jingzhou] on the ground, urging him on. Without waiting for him to stand firm, [Ziyu] raised his knife and charged forward. Despite his disheveled appearance and weak figure, [Ziyu] displayed a masculine aura in his stance of wielding the knife, as if he was a hero holding a long blade to bring order to the chaotic world and establish his dominance over the land with his iron horse.
0:34:0|0:34:8|[Jingzhou] felt nothing but a sense of killing intent in his sight, knowing [Ziyu]'s determination at this moment. He resolutely placed the umbrella in front of him and faced the force of [Ziyu].
0:34:8|0:34:14|The two of them moved back and forth, with [Jingzhou] making great progress, but still unable to match the bamboo staff in [Ziyu]'s hands.
0:34:14|0:34:18|[Ziyu] found a flaw in the midst of the offensive and struck at the neck.
0:34:34|0:34:49|After finishing speaking, he leaned on his cane and gasped for breath. [Xiaoai] quickly stepped forward, supporting [Ziyu] with great effort. Unexpectedly, he pushed himself away again, staggering to [Jingzhou]'s side and spoke.
0:35:19|0:35:27|[Jingzhou] knelt on the ground and received three strikes from [Ziyu]'s staff, but remained motionless.
0:35:37|0:35:56|His voice echoed in the cave, penetrating the thoughts of [Jingzhou]. The mountain wind and fine rain were dense and thick. The three of them had different thoughts. On the other side, for some reason, [Pei Liang] invited the courtiers to a feast in the main hall, with silk and bamboo placed in front of the hall, encountering fate and controlling the wind on paper.
0:35:56|0:36:2|Officials from civil and military departments sat behind the stage, toasting and dancing while the dancer Qingyi showcased her skills in front of the audience.
0:36:2|0:36:16|Pei Liang is now leisurely exuding a drunken air, swaying with the music on the huge paper in the hall, while behind him, Qing Ping is pouring herself a drink, sneering at the pretense of peace.
0:36:28|0:36:44|In the court, the civil officials all offered flattery, while Tian Zhan and other military generals remained silent, showing disdain in their eyes. Pei Liang, indifferent, casually wrote a character "Pei" with a brush, then turned to Qing Ping and said.
0:36:47|0:37:5|[Qing Ping] refused to answer, [Pei Liang] smiled faintly, and then continued to admire the calligraphy with a pleased expression. Suddenly, a servant announced the arrival of Lu Yan, who entered the hall and waved his sleeve to dismiss the musicians and dancers. After a quick jog, he bowed before His Highness.
0:37:36|0:37:43|He did not entangle with [Qing Ping], nor did he explain to the officials. He pointed at [Jingzhou]. Both civil and military officials all looked towards [Jingzhou].
0:38:24|0:38:35|This statement was made in the court, causing chaos even among the civil officials, and the military commanders were even more furious. Your sister, the dignified Princess, is actually going to become the concubine of the son of an enemy general.
0:38:35|0:38:43|The arrogance of [Yang Cang] and his son is evident.
0:39:31|0:39:36|Tian's advice was not heeded, leading to his demotion to a commoner, as he shouted to drive away the eunuchs around him.
0:39:36|0:39:47|Pei Liang took off his morning court cap and threw it to the ground. At this moment, with his back facing the courtiers, his face was particularly dark. He angrily grabbed his court robe and threw it haphazardly, hitting Jingzhou in front of him, who then stood up and left the seat.
0:39:53|0:40:19|[Pei Liang] remained silent, but unexpectedly Tian Zhan shouted loudly, then swiftly kicked and broke a screen frame beside him. [Pei Liang] turned around to gaze at Ying Ling with a bitter expression, his face covered in dust that was hard to dissipate. He quickly stepped onto the hall, drew his bow and shot an arrow at the full moon. The arrow missed, but pierced into the gap between the green bricks under Tian Zhan's feet. He then bent down to pull out the arrow.
0:40:21|0:40:38|In front of the civil and military officials, as the arrow pierced into his right chest staining his white robe with blood, [Pei Liang] let out a furious laugh, then he took the arrow from the pot, drew his bow and charged straight towards Tian Zhan. Just as he was about to kill him, he saw [Qing Ping] blocking his line of sight.
0:40:42|0:40:53|Upon hearing the words of Tian Zhan behind her and witnessing Pei Liang's actions in front of her, Qing Ping was furious. She pressed down the longbow in Pei Liang's hand and picked up the dagger that Yang Ping had given to Jingzhou, saying.
0:40:56|0:41:17|Shortly after, [Qing Ping] turned around menacingly with a dagger and left. The scene then shifted to the training ground in the city of [Jingzhou], where two men in black robes stood in the pouring rain, each wielding a large knife. One attacked with a long knife while the other calmly twisted the handle to deflect the strange stones. In the blink of an eye, the man's long knife was knocked to the ground amidst the sparks and flashes.
0:41:18|0:41:39|The two individuals, one old and one young, are none other than the father and son duo of [Yang Cang] and [Yang Ping]. [Yang Ping] picked up the long knife dropped by his father and walked to the opposite side of [Yang Cang]. Holding the knife handle against his chest and abdomen, he brandished the blade towards the sky and engaged in a fearless battle with [Yang Cang]. His youthful vigor and swift movements impressed [Yang Cang], who leaned on his long knife and spoke.
0:42:1|0:42:9|After the martial arts competition, father and son stood under the solitary pavilion in the school field, watching as [Jingzhou] discussed the wind and clouds with [Pei Liang] in the dense rain.
0:44:22|0:44:28|[Ziyu] was lost in thought, repeating [Xiaoai]'s words softly while [Jingzhou] also glanced sideways with some consideration.
0:44:42|0:44:47|Xiaoai arrived at the formation before Jingzhou, holding Pei Liang's umbrella and facing Ziyu.
0:44:47|0:44:56|When she set up her posture, Ziyu attacked with a bamboo staff. Xiaoai, calm and composed, advanced with Pei Liang's umbrella in hand, showcasing the subtlety of a woman with each step.
0:44:56|0:45:3|During the close combat, whenever the bamboo staff touched the umbrella of [Xiaoai] or [Pei Liang], they were both disarmed by the spinning motion of their bodies carrying the umbrella.
0:45:3|0:45:10|Ziyu was deeply impressed by the profound Tai Chi charm, leaving him speechless for a moment. He looked at Xiaoai and said,
0:45:16|0:45:50|After finishing speaking, he leaned on his cane and walked back to the formation, waiting. Across from him, Xiaoai and Jingzhou locked eyes briefly before quickly looking away. Then he turned around and entered the formation, facing Ziyu. Jingzhou held an umbrella outside the formation, hesitating slightly, with concerns about the relationship between master and servant. Hearing Ziyu's excited words, Jingzhou felt somewhat helpless. He directly took the umbrella from Pei Liang's hand and walked towards Xiaoai, standing behind her. Although the two were under the same umbrella, there was still a gap between them. Ziyu was already unable to contain his impatience and began to speak.
0:46:9|0:46:21|Then, with one hand supporting Xiaoai's soft body as they shook hands, and the other hand hooking around her slender waist, the sound of qin and se stirred. Ziyu, in a flowing black robe, swung the bamboo staff like a long knife, his gaze like thunder, stepping out of the formation of Yuyang.
0:46:21|0:46:30|Watching Xiaoai and Jingzhou on the opposite side, their movements are in perfect harmony, like the snow on the Su Mountain. Dancing with Pei Liang's umbrella, they move like flowing clouds, meeting the enemy's overwhelming force head-on.
0:46:32|0:46:51|The bamboo umbrellas connect as if thunder striking the wind and clouds. Even with supreme power, if it is lost like flowing water, it is as insignificant as stepping on a goose feather. Mastering the void seems like exerting all one's strength on emptiness, yet without any response, it is maddening. In an instant, the three moves are brought together, [Ziyu] does not dare to slack off, directly using [Yang Cang]'s move to injure himself.
0:46:51|0:47:11|The oil-paper umbrella surface was split by force, while the bamboo staff was bound by the umbrella ribs, making it difficult to pull away. [Xiaoai] skillfully manipulated the umbrella, swirling it around and rolling the bamboo staff like surging waves. Her movements, resembling the powerful and varied stances of the [Yang Family Sword Technique], turned the situation to her advantage. She shook the bamboo staff out of [Ziyu]'s hand, causing it to fall outside the formation.
0:47:26|0:47:33|Ziyu lay on the damp ground, and Xiaoai hurried to help.
0:47:45|0:47:51|[Ziyu] sat up and leaned under [Xiaoai]'s umbrella to speak.
0:47:55|0:48:3|[Jingzhou] responded with a sound and then left the cave through the dangerous passageway. [Xiaoai] gazed around, taking a while to shift her gaze away from [Jingzhou]'s departing figure.
0:48:32|0:48:44|Seeing [Ziyu] with such an attitude, [Xiaoai] furrowed her delicate eyebrows and looked flustered. The scene then shifts to a bamboo forest, where fine raindrops fall on rugged and strange rocks, with a figure in the distance approaching the sound of the flute.
0:48:44|0:48:52|Ziyu was seen wearing a robe, his true appearance difficult to discern amidst the bamboo and rocks. Following the sound led to a low stone forest.
0:48:52|0:49:11|A man dressed in black robes, wearing a bamboo hat, sat on a rock. It was [Jingzhou]. He looked up, revealing his face, and it turned out to be the warrior who had caused a scene in the court, General Tian Zhan, who had angered [Pei Liang] but then retreated. He walked slowly to stand in front of [Jingzhou], listening quietly to the sound of the flute.
0:49:19|0:49:27|[Jingzhou] remained silent, placed the ancient flute on his knee and gazed into the depths of the bamboo forest, then turned to ask Tian Zhan.
0:50:6|0:50:20|Upon hearing the words from [Jingzhou], Tian Zhan turned back slowly, looking at him with a hint of confusion. Without much explanation, [Jingzhou] led him back to the Governor's Mansion to avoid the household servants, and directly took him outside the secret passage. In front of Tian Zhan, [Jingzhou] demonstrated the method to open the secret chamber garage.
0:50:20|0:50:26|It seems that after Ziyu's performance in the court farce, he regards Tian Zhan as one of his own.
0:50:26|0:50:32|Without the signal from [Ziyu], [Jingzhou] would never dare to reveal the secret mechanism of the fighting room to others at that time.
0:50:32|0:50:56|[Jingzhou] sent Tian Zhan into the secret passage and stood guard in the inner room. Tian Zhan felt his way through the narrow passage and finally entered the dark cave. As he pushed the door open, he saw a frail figure hunched over in the dimly lit cave. In front of a crack where a faint light shone through, the person turned slowly, revealing to be the ailing [Ziyu].
0:51:2|0:51:8|Ziyu looked at Tian Zhan kneeling on the ground, his eyes fixed on him for a while, nodding slightly and saying.
0:52:59|0:53:7|Tian Zhan watched as [Ziyu] trembled while lifting the teapot, quickly reaching out to take it and pour tea for the commander, then spoke.
0:53:43|0:53:49|Tian Zhan bowed apologetically, but little did he know that [Ziyu] would gently pat his fist with the palm of his hand and say softly.
0:54:36|0:55:3|Tian Zhan was surprised to find that Ziyu had long harbored rebellious intentions. The boldness he displayed earlier was just a temporary expedient. The reason he kept Pei Liang around was simply to make the most of him. Leaving the arena, Tian Zhan walked out of the secret passage, carefully closing the hidden door. Turning around, he saw Jingzhou bowing solemnly behind the screen. In the dimly lit Governor's Mansion, illuminated by moonlight, Tian Zhan's gaze kept wandering on Jingzhou's face.
0:55:3|0:55:9|Then he bypassed the screen and came to [Jingzhou], carefully examining him, while [Jingzhou] lowered his head and nodded.
0:55:11|0:55:21|Tian Zhan did not answer, but simply shifted his gaze away from [Jingzhou]'s face, continuing to roam over his figure. After a while, he pursed his lips, shook his head, and then slowly spoke with emotion.
0:55:30|0:55:55|Tian Zhan nodded slowly, agreeing to what [Jingzhou] had said. The scene then shifted to the depths of the bamboo forest, where the 100 death row prisoners mentioned earlier were standing with bamboo poles, their faces showing varying degrees of malice, but all eyes were fixed on Tian Zhan holding [Pei Liang]'s umbrella.
0:55:55|0:56:12|At this moment, he took the opportunity to fight with a death row prisoner and taught the rest of the group how to counter Yang Cang's soft knife technique. After defeating the death row prisoner, Tian Zhan looked at everyone and shouted in the bamboo forest.
0:57:11|0:57:30|Qing Ping now realizes that Pei Liang has been hiding his feelings for many years. As a mere daughter, she is heartbroken by her brother Yang Ping's betrayal. Meanwhile, in a secret chamber, the three of them, master and servants, are plotting together with a drunken Xiaoai being the only exception.
0:57:31|0:57:38|[Ziyu] is about to get what he wants, so he swallows the jade and enjoys it to the fullest.
0:58:15|0:58:22|[Jingzhou] heard these words and felt a little guilty. He glanced at [Xiaoai], then quickly moved away, took a sip of wine and said.
0:58:29|0:58:57|Listening to Ziyu's words with a strong sense of emotion, Jingzhou dared not ask, only watching him pour and drink by himself, intoxicated. As the banquet ended, just as Jingzhou was about to leave, Ziyu was already swaying unsteadily, barely managing to say these four words with Xiaoai's support. Jingzhou then solemnly bowed outside the cave entrance, followed by Xiaoai, walking back to the inner room.
0:58:57|0:59:9|Two figures dressed in revealing clothing sat facing each other on the bed. Two maids finished arranging the bedding and then left with a bow, everything seemed as usual, proper and unremarkable.
0:59:12|0:59:18|[Jingzhou] spoke softly, different from before. [Xiaoai] lowered her head and nodded, asking in a soft voice.
0:59:57|1:0:7|[Jingzhou] only spoke a few words, but [Xiaoai] had already teared up, it was the moment of parting that brought out deep emotions, expressing the heartfelt feelings in their eyes.
1:0:18|1:0:34|[Jingzhou] stood firm and met the tender gaze of [Xiaoai]. In the prolonged eye contact, the two of them were unable to speak for a long time. Avoiding [Jingzhou]'s intense gaze, [Xiaoai] lowered her head and let out a long sigh.
1:0:44|1:0:59|[Xiaoai] tears rolled down the delicate fuzz at the bottom of her eyes, looking pitiful under the moonlight. On the other side, [Jingzhou] also had red eyes, looking at [Xiaoai] with a complex gaze, hoping she would say something.
1:0:59|1:1:13|However, [Xiaoai] just kept crying without any intention of speaking. After a while of silence, [Jingzhou] stood up facing [Xiaoai], the tears on his nose still not dried, his eyes filled with restraint and reluctance as he looked at [Xiaoai].
1:1:18|1:1:25|After a word of thanks, [Jingzhou] bowed deeply to [Xiaoai], then walked out of the room under the mottled moonlight.
1:1:25|1:1:50|Beside the bed, [Xiaoai] was already in tears, looking in the direction where [Jingzhou] had left, unable to come back to her senses for a long time. As the night grew deeper, on the blue stone floor of the Governor's Mansion, a pair of slender and delicate bare feet moved gracefully, with fair and tender skin, like white camellia petals. They belonged to a woman, gliding lightly and swiftly, silently swirling her skirt.
1:1:50|1:2:8|Through the screen, [Xiaoai] appeared in the main hall of the mansion with a graceful figure, quietly entering the mansion as if surrounded by a faint light veil. The hidden passage revealed a small hole in the wall connecting to the inner room as [Ziyu] lifted the corner of the bricks and stones in the corner.
1:2:8|1:2:18|In the dimly lit room, a faint light seeped through the hole, illuminating [Ziyu]. Hunched over, the interplay of light and shadow made him appear even more sinister as he peered through the small opening.
1:2:18|1:2:36|Watching as [Xiaoai] barefoot searches for [Jingzhou] in the hall, it turns out that since the moment they were imprisoned in the fighting room, [Jingzhou] and [Xiaoai] have been completely under the surveillance of [Ziyu]. Like driving away insects, [Ziyu] twists his body to adjust his angle, eager to know the purpose of [Xiaoai]'s visit.
1:2:36|1:3:1|Outside, the bed of [Jingzhou] was empty. Startled, [Xiaoai] frantically searched around and in the corner of the screen, she saw [Jingzhou] curled up, trembling. [Xiaoai] was both surprised and heartbroken, looking at [Jingzhou] as if he had fallen into a nightmare from childhood, panicked and helpless. She couldn't help but bend down, gently placing her hand on [Jingzhou]'s shoulder.
1:3:2|1:3:18|Feeling someone approaching from behind, [Jingzhou] suddenly turned around and sat up, with a fierce and fearful expression on his face. After seeing the person clearly, he slowly regulated his breath, with a hint of doubt and excitement. Leaning against the screen, he looked towards [Xiaoai], as if in a dream.
1:3:18|1:3:27|[Jingzhou] saw [Xiaoai] slowly approaching, and even lifted the embroidered handkerchief to cover his cheeks, gentle like a dragonfly touching the water, with his heart rippling like water.
1:3:27|1:3:35|[Jingzhou] had never seen [Xiaoai] so tender before, as if in an instant he had immersed himself in warm spring water, soaking his body in fragrant red mud.
1:3:35|1:3:41|At this moment, the two are already intimately close, with one secretly expressing their feelings like the fragrance of orchids, causing confusion in [Jingzhou]'s heart.
1:3:41|1:3:52|Then [Xiaoai] used her arms as a pillow, embracing [Jingzhou] into her arms, gentle like a hero, feeling the softness of the delicate body in front of her, [Jingzhou] surrendered without resistance.
1:3:52|1:3:57|Xiaoai gently sniffed the warmth in his arms, inhaling the fragrance of orchids and musk from the jade-like lips.
1:3:57|1:4:1|[Jingzhou] gently wiped the cream on her chest and kissed her fair neck in the chaos.
1:4:1|1:4:8|The two met after a long time, abandoning the distinctions of status and the norms of society, only love remains intertwined.
1:4:8|1:4:17|The intense desire colludes and infiltrates the mind and body. [Jingzhou] uses his lips to capture the delicate beauty of the body, while [Xiaoai]’s red lips explore the wisdom of tenderness.
1:4:17|1:4:26|It was a night of river cruise listening to the spring rain, how could it be just a simple act of submission. [Jingzhou]'s hands were warm and strong, already clasped around [Xiaoai]'s delicate neck.
1:4:26|1:4:47|The brief separation of lips and teeth was unbearable for [Jingzhou], he disregarded everything and met [Xiaoai] with a shallow embrace, feeling the magnificence of the man's lips. [Xiaoai] also became more immersed, her bright eyes dimming gradually, becoming increasingly hazy. The dim light and candlelight intertwined, spreading the spring scenery through the screen in the mansion, filling the small world.
1:4:47|1:4:55|Watching the two figures entwined in the dim light, [Ziyu] had a complex expression on his face. The fleeting night of passion quickly passed, and the scene shifted to [Jingzhou].
1:5:0|1:5:6|In the lonely pavilion of the school field, [Yang Cang] sat on a horse stool, sipping tea to rest. His son [Yang Ping] stood by his side.
1:5:6|1:5:13|Upon hearing the messenger's report, [Yang Cang] and his son exchanged a glance before quickly changing into armor and leading the soldiers to rush to the city gate of [Jingzhou].
1:5:13|1:5:43|[Jingzhou] is nestled among the mountains, surrounded by rivers and perched on a treacherous terrain. There is only one narrow pass, stretching between two steep peaks, allowing only four warships to pass side by side. In such a perilous place, it's no wonder that [Yang Cang] only left eight hundred soldiers and dared to claim that no one could break through the city gate of [Jingzhou]. Looking around, one can only see two moving pavilions in the steep peaks, carrying a massive object. It is a platform made of bamboo poles, painted with the Eight Trigrams of Yin and Yang, mirroring the battle formation in the secret chamber of the mansion.
1:5:43|1:5:54|Amid the exclamations of the guards in Jingzhou, the bamboo platform completely ignored the underwater pitfalls and slowly approached the city gate of Jingzhou.
1:6:2|1:6:14|Within the city gates, the soldiers are clad in black armor, wielding long knives, all trained in the Yang Family's swordsmanship. The eight hundred defenders in the city are all young soldiers from the Yang Family. On the pavilion, Jingzhou wears plain clothes and a bamboo hat, carrying Pei Liang on his back.
1:6:14|1:6:26|Looking up, [Yang Cang] glanced at the swaying rain as if it were nothing, and then let out a shout.
1:6:35|1:6:40|[Yang Ping] stared at [Jingzhou] and the Yin-Yang Tai Chi diagram for a while before speaking.
1:7:23|1:7:43|Then he swung his long knife and walked down the city gate, arriving at the opposite platform. [Jingzhou] turned the mechanism on the platform, causing the electric bamboo bridge to fall under the steps of Chongguan, right at [Yang Cang]'s feet. The precision of the river crossing plan was evident.
1:7:43|1:8:9|The intertwining sounds echoed beneath the platform, coming from the two warships. In the dark hold of the ship, among the two warships, were [Tian Zhan] and the 100 death row prisoners. Apart from wearing armor on their backs, they all carried weapons, standing in formation, ready. Feeling the warship beneath their feet gradually stabilizing, as soon as they heard the loud noise of the bamboo bridge hitting the city gate above their heads, [Tian Zhan] slowly stood up, ordered someone to open the hatch at the bottom of the ship to reveal the river water, and then waved his hand to give a quiet command.
1:8:9|1:8:21|The condemned prisoners, apart from their weapons, also have three bamboo tubes strapped to their backs with leather to store oxygen. They are seen biting the breathing tube connected to the bamboo tube, jumping into the water one by one, showing no fear.
1:8:21|1:8:53|In the crowd, [Tian Zhan] spotted a figure he was extremely familiar with. He shouted in surprise, but before [Tian Zhan] could stop her, [Qing Ping] had already disappeared into the icy river. On the other side, [Yang Cang] was dressed in armor, with a tiger-head helmet on his shoulders, high boots on his feet, and a long sword in his hand as he stepped onto the platform. Little did he know that at that moment, [Tian Zhan] was leading a hundred death row prisoners into the waterway under the cover of continuous rain, aiming to break through the Chongguan water gate.
1:8:53|1:9:0|Enter the city of [Jingzhou]. Without much talk on the platform, the two of them step into the Tai Chi diagram, each taking a stance and facing each other.
1:9:1|1:9:12|Yang Cang looked at Jingzhou without saying a word, then raised his knife and stood on the platform, waiting quietly for his actions. Just by hearing the sound, one could tell that Yang Cang's knife was as heavy as ten thousand catties, truly extraordinary.
1:9:13|1:9:24|On the other hand, [Jingzhou] took the burden of the umbrella, removed the ropes, pressed the top of the hangar, and unfolded it one after another. A total of forty-eight diamond blades were embedded in front of him, twisting and turning, shining like the surface of an umbrella.
1:9:24|1:9:32|Cutting through the wind and rain, sharp and infinite. [Yang Cang] also cast a sidelong glance.
1:9:36|1:9:50|[Jingzhou] showed his stance, [Yang Cang] stood with a long knife in hand. After a light laugh, he swung the knife with full force, as if it had a spirit. With a buzzing sound, [Jingzhou] threw off the umbrella on his shoulder and twisted the straight handle. Three sharp blades shot out, forcing [Yang Cang], who was about to engage in close combat, to stop and defend with his knife.
1:9:51|1:10:24|When [Jingzhou] and a woman entered with graceful steps, [Yang Cang] felt ashamed and angry, ready to attack with his sword. However, the woman used a golden oil to dissolve the attack, with the sharp blade pressing against his throat for a moment. The brief exchange ended with the woman gaining the upper hand, making it difficult for [Jingzhou] to counter. Both retreated to their positions, on guard, and [Yang Cang] abandoned his reckless attitude.
1:10:24|1:10:43|At the same time, in the sewer, Tian Zhan led a hundred death row prisoners to finally sneak into the city of [Jingzhou]. The rain poured down, the sound of water sank throughout the city, and no one noticed the slight noise coming from the waterway. Tian Zhan lifted the blue stone cover with his hand, exposing it to the daylight again, leading the crowd onto the streets of [Jingzhou].
1:10:43|1:10:54|The condemned prisoners were on guard while the passersby were armed with weapons. At this moment, [Qing Ping] also crawled out from the waterway, her face and body covered in filth, no longer showing any trace of princess-like demeanor.
1:10:54|1:11:10|Over a hundred people, all looking disheveled, yet unable to hide the aura of death on them, the group of death row prisoners, armed with crossbows, followed Tian Zhan as they crouched and made their way to the main street of [Jingzhou] city. Taking advantage of the sound of rain and the mist to avoid being seen, they bypassed the blind spot of the arrow tower.
1:11:10|1:11:28|Tian Zhan waved his arm to signal everyone to stop, then raised his hand forward with [Qing Ping], and four cold lights suddenly appeared from the double crossbows, causing the Yan Kingdom soldiers on the arrow tower to fall to the ground instantly. Just as Tian Zhan's surprise attack was starting to take effect, the situation on [Jingzhou]'s side was far from optimistic.
1:11:28|1:11:35|In the second encounter, he sparred with [Yang Cang] countless times, but still couldn't harm him in the slightest, feeling like he was in a life-threatening situation.
1:11:35|1:11:40|Finally, he was accidentally cut across the chest by that long knife. [Yang Cang] finished speaking and turned his back, walking back into the formation.
1:11:43|1:11:51|After Jingzhou finished cooking in the city, someone took Pei Liang from his hand, and a handle was turned upside down on the ground and then grabbed.
1:11:51|1:12:10|A shield held in front of the body, bamboo from the city used as a rope to connect, a slingshot set up and lying among [Pei Liang], the umbrella surface is closed up and down, resembling golden waves, [Yang Ping] and the others are all like this.
1:12:10|1:12:24|When everyone in the umbrella is ready, several death row prisoners exerted their strength to bend the tough bamboo and pull [Pei Liang]'s rope, using the slippery rainwater to rotate up and down the umbrella surface and rush towards the city gate from the main road in the city.
1:12:25|1:12:43|[Jingzhou] The city guards were puzzled by the appearance of these golden wave-like figures, and in their confusion, sounded the alarm. After the signal was given, a large number of soldiers in black armor appeared on the main road, holding longbows, waiting for Tianzhan and others to approach. As they drew near, the soldiers bent their bows and shot, filling the air with a rain of arrows.
1:12:43|1:12:52|However, Tian Zhan and others used the diamond blade of [Pei Liang] as a shield, and few of the defending soldiers could hit the bullseye from a hundred paces, shooting arrows into the gaps.
1:12:52|1:13:0|Half of the death row prisoners were hidden among [Pei Liang], shooting countless city defenders with the short swords fired by Zhuge's crossbow, sending chills down people's spines.
1:13:0|1:13:13|Time has passed, and there have been casualties, but compared to the soldiers of the Yan Kingdom, the difference is far greater. Especially when facing 800 soldiers from the Yang family with just over a hundred death row prisoners, defending the city of [Jingzhou], this extraordinary story is truly unprecedented.
1:13:14|1:13:45|If we can really take down the city gate of [Jingzhou], it may not be a feat that will go down in history, but it will definitely be a remarkable achievement. Upon hearing this, [Yang Ping] had a drastic change in facial expression, immediately leading troops to reinforce. Facing [Yang Ping] in the field of battle, he did not show any fear, calmly giving orders and shouting loudly. Following his lead, everyone together held up [Pei Liang] above their heads, with both hands gripping the handle of the umbrella mechanism.
1:13:46|1:13:53|At Tian Zhan's command, everyone launched a row of flying blades, then squatted on the ground and launched another row, repeating this process.
1:13:53|1:13:58|Yang Ping, who was leading the charge, also commanded his subordinates to wield their swords for defense.
1:13:58|1:14:6|After a wave of simultaneous shooting, the invincible Yang family army suffered several casualties. [Yang Ping] felt heartbroken, but had to lead the soldiers to continue charging forward.
1:14:6|1:14:21|Just now, as he rushed forward, he saw the crowd on the opposite side carrying umbrellas on their shoulders, moving forward like a woman, with a graceful and agile demeanor. Princess Chang recognized [Yang Ping], her eyes widened in anger and she shouted, then she quickly rushed forward.
1:14:21|1:14:29|[Yang Ping] still doesn't understand the subtleties of Pei San's moves. In the confrontation with [Qing Ping], he unexpectedly suffered losses, leaving him with nowhere to vent his anger.
1:14:29|1:14:34|The forces of the two countries, Yan and Pei, are entangled within the city, and the battle of the main generals outside the city has also reached a critical juncture.
1:14:35|1:14:45|In the third round of the battle, Yang Cang did exactly as Ziyu had predicted, using the upward sword technique, while Jingzhou countered with the umbrella technique learned from Xiaoai. The sword was thrown into the umbrella, harnessing the power of Cang's sword.
1:14:45|1:14:57|Twisting his body to move the umbrella, the long knife slipped out of Yang Cang's hand, as predicted by Ziyu, the battle came to a halt here. Unexpectedly, Yang Cang still had the strength for one more fight, flying to retrieve the weapon and swinging it towards Jingzhou.
1:14:57|1:15:6|At this moment, suspended in mid-air, [Jingzhou] had no way to avoid the force of the sword and could only take a blow from [Yang Cang]. His thigh was cut, blood flowing freely, a desperate situation.
1:15:25|1:15:32|[Jingzhou] looked up and saw the flag of the Yang family army still standing on the pass, knowing that the fighting in the city was not over yet, and spoke.
1:15:42|1:15:54|Yang Cang, seeing him unwilling to accept defeat, also felt greatly regretful in his heart. He carried his long knife back to the formation, preparing for the next move. The battle for the main general was still undecided, but as Ziyu had predicted, the city was already at the final critical moment.
1:15:54|1:16:5|A death row prisoner swung his umbrella and roared at the military flag, but unfortunately he didn't have the chance to damage the flag at all before being killed by a single slash from [Yang Ping] who flew over.
1:16:5|1:16:13|Princess Chang attempted to attack with a spinning umbrella, but all the knife soldiers were dodged by [Yang Ping]. In a moment of panic, she was struck in the chest by [Yang Ping]'s horizontal sword.
1:16:13|1:16:24|Enduring the pain in her chest and abdomen, Princess Chang continued to fight against [Yang Ping]. However, the two were vastly mismatched in martial arts skills. In a moment, Princess Chang was injured again by [Yang Ping], relying on a rock for support to catch her breath.
1:16:24|1:16:29|In the midst of the crisis, [Tian Zhan] stepped in to rescue, engaging in a fierce battle with [Yang Ping].
1:16:29|1:16:51|At this moment, he was also at the end of his strength, relying solely on the determination to win to swing his fists and feet, challenging [Yang Ping] by fighting blow by blow, causing him to be covered in blood and flesh. Unexpectedly, [Yang Ping] felt for a weapon at his side, grasping the blade and stabbing it directly into the lower back of [Tian Zhan]. The intense pain struck, and the already bloodied and defeated [Tian Zhan] could not bear it and fainted. The Princess Consort quickly rushed forward with an umbrella, engaging in another struggle with [Yang Ping].
1:16:51|1:17:3|[Yang Ping] took up his weapon and let the Princess chase after him. He dragged the blade on the ground, splashing countless blood. Seeing the Princess leaping into the air, he knew the timing was right, and he delivered a powerful upward strike to her waist and abdomen.
1:17:5|1:17:23|The body lies in an endless sea of corpses, blood flowing from the blade, truly displaying extreme dominance. Struck by this blade, Princess Chang falls to the ground, her long hair scattered, her face washed clean of blood by the rain, revealing her original daughter-like appearance. At this moment, she is no longer able to fight, lying on the ground with blood flowing profusely from her body.
1:17:23|1:17:31|[Yang Ping] saw the situation and picked up his sword, also covered in blood and panting heavily. Looking at the revealed face of the princess, he opened his mouth in confusion and mockery.
1:17:44|1:17:53|Then Yang Ping approached the Princess slowly, squatted down and said with a pensive look.
1:17:53|1:18:7|Recalling the words of the woman in front of him, [Yang Ping] realized that she was the younger sister of the Lord of the State of Pei, Princess [Qing Ping], who had almost become his concubine and was a princess of the enemy country.
1:18:8|1:18:24|Just as he leaned in to listen, the Princess suddenly pulled out the dagger given by [Yang Ping], and with all her strength, she stabbed it into the back of his neck. With a muffled groan from [Yang Ping], the Princess forcefully pulled out the dagger, only to see blood gushing out like a spring, beyond any hope of recovery.
1:18:25|1:18:34|Within moments, [Yang Ping] bled to death, while on the other side, the Princess Consort also lost the strength to hold the weapon in her hand, dropping the sword to the ground with a smile before passing away.
1:18:35|1:18:41|The scene shifts to the Governor's Mansion, where [Xiaoai] is leaning against the wall leading to the secret chamber, feeling for something.
1:18:41|1:18:49|Turning into the secret chamber, [Xiaoai] glanced back towards the depths of the cave to confirm that there was no movement before turning around to flip over the broken stones and tiles on the wall.
1:18:50|1:19:1|After some fiddling, she finally discovered the crevice that Ziyu had been using to spy, Xiaoai couldn't help but break out in a cold sweat. Looking out through the crack, the entire inner courtyard was revealed before her eyes.
1:19:2|1:19:7|Upon reflection, he knew that the scene of the secret meeting with [Jingzhou] last night had already entered [Ziyu]'s eyes.
1:19:8|1:19:23|Once a man of extraordinary grace and superiority, Ziyu's husband had become a strange man who imprisoned himself in a room to spy on his wife after a year or so.
1:19:38|1:19:51|Sensing that Ziyu's questioning had a hidden meaning, Xiaoai did not avoid or retreat. The words she spoke were also ambiguous. Anyone who could set up such a big situation in just one year would certainly be able to hear the hidden meaning in Xiaoai's words.
1:19:51|1:19:57|He repeatedly gasped as he stepped in front of [Xiaoai], his gaze fixed fiercely on his wife, remaining silent for a long time.
1:20:2|1:20:8|It was Xiaoai who spoke first with such words.
1:20:8|1:20:15|The so-called harmony between the qin and the se, with hearts in tune, [Xiaoai] also wants to take the opportunity of playing together to explore what is on [Ziyu]'s mind at the moment.
1:20:15|1:20:26|The couple sat in the center of the Yin-Yang formation, each holding a qin and a se, with [Xiaoai] taking the lead in plucking the strings. The music flowed effortlessly, the sword edge fierce, mirroring the struggle and anger in their hearts.
1:20:26|1:20:34|On the other side, Ziyu's scattered hair was like a storm, his fingers on the strings of the zither like soldiers with blades, the music was dark and chilling.
1:20:34|1:20:43|In the deep cave, Ziyu and Jingzhou played the zither and the lute together, their hearts intertwined with the music, oscillating back and forth in each other's hearts.
1:20:43|1:20:48|Ziyu's face still showed a look of madness as they delved deeper, while Xiaoai's gaze became even more complex.
1:20:48|1:20:56|During the harmonious music performance and the day of the extinguishing of the strong crossbows, the battle for the main general on the Taiji platform ended with [Jingzhou] losing.
1:20:56|1:21:9|In the pouring rain, Tian Zhan woke up and saw the corpses of Princess Chang and [Yang Ping] in front of him. Drenched in the rain, he looked at the two blood-stained bodies, feeling a mix of emotions in his heart. After a while, he finally shouted out loud.
1:21:29|1:21:41|In the city, the death row prisoner Yu Li is still shouting loudly, trying to disrupt the enemy's morale. He is tied to a wooden stake with a military flag, falling from the cliff at Shuncheng Pass and landing heavily on the platform below.
1:21:44|1:21:49|Upon recalling the farewell words "As long as the flag stands, the people remain," [Yang Cang] realized that his son had died in battle.
1:21:49|1:22:5|He roared in anger and threw his long knife, intending to kill [Jingzhou] on the spot. Dodging the knife, [Jingzhou] got up and continued to fight with [Yang Cang]. At this moment, [Yang Cang] fought bare-handed, but with a heart full of anger and strong martial arts skills, he suppressed [Jingzhou] so that he couldn't lift his head.
1:22:5|1:22:28|Ziyu forcefully snatched Pei Liang from Jingzhou's hands, then threw him to the ground. As he was about to continue his brutal attack on Jingzhou, he was stabbed in the abdomen by the last page umbrella blade. Yang Cang, in pain and furious, kicked Jingzhou, sending him flying and crashing onto the broken bamboo platform. A long bamboo pole pierced deeply into Jingzhou's lower back, causing excruciating pain. Yang Cang, at this point, had gone completely mad.
1:22:28|1:22:39|The armor was scattered, with a weapon at the waist and blood flowing profusely. He grabbed [Jingzhou] by the neck, intending to kill him in front of everyone. He reluctantly drew the sword from his waist, raised it high, and was about to strike down.
1:22:39|1:22:49|[Jingzhou] clings on with his last breath, resisting [Yang Cang]'s arm, the situation reaches a stalemate. [Yang Cang] is determined to avenge his son, regardless of the consequences, he exerts all his strength to press the blade down.
1:22:49|1:23:3|At the critical moment of life and death, [Jingzhou] instead calmed down, using the resilience of [Pei Liang]'s knife handle to flick the blade, cutting open [Yang Cang]'s throat directly. A fierce general like him should not die in battle, but instead exhausted in a brawl, a story both glorious and lamentable.
1:23:3|1:23:11|[Yang Cang] reached out and flipped onto the Taiji platform, taking a deep breath in the mirror, enduring the severe pain in his lower back, and pulling himself away from the bamboo pole.
1:23:13|1:23:31|After this life-and-death battle, [Jingzhou] was covered in wounds, blood staining his broken body, his clothes tattered and unable to cover him. Nevertheless, [Jingzhou] still looked up at the pouring rain, laughing. As the fierce battle came to an end, the couple of Qin and Se of the fighting room finally finished their music.
1:23:31|1:23:37|Xiaoai's face was full of astonishment, as if she had heard some cruel plans from Ziyu's qin music.
1:23:37|1:24:3|Time flies, coming to the night. In the deep alleys of Jingzhou city, [Jingzhou] sat on the horse without having time to deal with the wounds on his body. Relying on memory, he wandered on the way home. After a moment of contemplation by a stone bridge, something seemed to stir in the depths of his memory. He dismounted and walked into the old house in front of him. The deeper he went into Jingzhou, the more convinced he was that this was the place he had been worrying about for over a decade, his long-lost hometown.
1:24:3|1:24:9|He walked unsteadily in the alley, desperately trying to retrieve the memories about this in the depths of his mind.
1:24:9|1:24:35|Walking into a deserted courtyard, rainwater dripped from the eaves, sometimes converging into threads, sometimes coalescing into chains, just like the current chaotic and disordered state of [Jingzhou]. Pushing open the door into the dark room, gently lifting the tattered curtain, a lonely elderly woman with white hair lying on the bed was reflected in the mirror. He walked to the bedside with his own hands and feet, silently crouching down to observe the old woman's weathered figure.
1:24:35|1:24:43|[Jingzhou] felt a deep sense of sorrow and anger in his heart. He moistened his eyes, reached out to support the old woman's shoulder, and gently pulled her, causing his mother to turn over.
1:24:43|1:24:57|The first thing that caught Ziyu's eyes was a dagger deeply embedded in his mother's chest. The blood at the wound had already dried up, and his mother's face showed no signs of fear. Ziyu's eyes widened in anger and he let out a loud cry.
1:24:58|1:25:11|As soon as the words fell, a flying knife broke through the window, followed by a dark figure rushing towards him. [Jingzhou] blocked the flying knife with his arm, then quickly dodged the attack of the dark figure, and got up again.
1:25:11|1:25:17|In a small room, three figures in black surround him. [Jingzhou] stares fiercely, ignoring the pain.
1:25:17|1:25:25|Yanking a throwing knife from his wrist, [Ziyu] widened his eyes and looked around at the three assassins nearby, saying,
1:25:35|1:25:57|However, the assassin did not explain and attacked with a long sword. [Jingzhou], already at the end of his strength, witnessed his mother's death at home. With sheer determination, he managed to kill one assassin, but left himself vulnerable to the other two. The two assassins kicked him together, sending [Jingzhou] flying through a wooden board and crashing to the ground. The two assassins closed in, leaving [Jingzhou] no chance to catch his breath.
1:25:57|1:26:23|Finally, they each thrust their long swords into the ribs and waist of [Jingzhou], pinning him to the wall. Just as the two assassins were about to finish off [Jingzhou], a sudden noise behind them startled them. In an instant, the two assassins were found dead on the ground with their throats slit, the sound of blood gushing incessantly. [Jingzhou] couldn't even see the rescuer's face clearly, only sensing a flash of sword light breaking the deadlock. Removing the weapon from his shoulder, [Jingzhou] looked at the person hidden behind the curtain.
1:26:39|1:26:43|If you believe what this person says, it means that the three assassins were sent by [Ziyu].
1:26:56|1:27:4|In the pouring rain, soldier [Pei Liang] is stationed inside the city of [Jingzhou], calling out alone in the city to find his sister [Qing Ping].
1:27:40|1:27:51|Pei Liang took the dagger, looked at the bloodstains on it with a sad expression, then angrily threw it to the ground, wanting to cry but unable to shed tears.
1:27:51|1:28:0|He was filled with remorse and regret, only to realize that it was too late to repent after the departed had already left.
1:28:0|1:28:15|With a long roar from [Pei Liang], the scene shifts to the grand hall of the Kingdom of Pei, where the same gathering of officials is seen celebrating. However, this time [Pei Liang] is seated on the throne, dressed in a black robe and wearing a nine-pronged crown, looking solemn.
1:28:15|1:28:25|Beside him were four jade thrones, Tian Zhan, Lu Yan, [Xiaoai], each holding their own territory. The seat between [Pei Liang] and [Xiaoai] has yet to be occupied.
1:28:25|1:28:32|Watching the courtiers in front of him listening to the music and watching the dance. Graceful and leisurely, [Pei Liang] tapped the armrest, then raised his cup.
1:28:32|1:28:36|When all the officials' eyes were on him, [Pei Liang] remained expressionless and slowly said
1:29:1|1:29:6|Hearing Pei Liang's words, Xiaoai knew that Jingzhou was not dead and felt somewhat relieved.
1:29:6|1:29:15|On the other side, three soldiers wearing armor and concealing their true faces with demon masks stormed into the Commander's Mansion, ready to kill anyone who dared to stand in their way.
1:29:15|1:29:23|Entering the inner courtyard, it seemed as if there was no one there. The three of them were highly skilled in martial arts, definitely not opponents that the household guards of the Governor's Mansion could match.
1:29:23|1:29:35|Two of them distracted the obstacles in the mansion, while one of them came to the wall where the secret chamber was located and felt around a bit, then opened the mechanism. When there was no one left to resist in the mansion, they slipped into the narrow and dangerous secret passage.
1:29:35|1:29:46|Three people with double swords in hand arrived at the entrance of the cave, but just as they were about to push the door to enter, a long sword stabbed out along the door crack, directly piercing the throat of the middle soldier.
1:29:46|1:29:50|The gate of the mansion opened, with [Ziyu] holding a long sword ready to face the enemy.
1:29:53|1:30:4|The soldier presented the jade pendant and said, then rushed forward to fight with [Ziyu]. This group of people was sent by [Pei Liang] to kill him in the arena. However, [Ziyu] had planned everything out, unaware that his lord had already taken precautions.
1:30:13|1:30:20|In the court, a eunuch hurriedly ran and reported to His Majesty. [Pei Liang] then showed a hint of joy and got up to greet him.
1:30:20|1:30:24|All the civil and military officials in the court stood up and bowed towards the outside of the main hall.
1:30:24|1:30:33|[Xiaoai] also stood up in a panic, looking at the doorway with deep contemplation. It was [Jingzhou] who entered the hall, still wearing that blood-stained blue robe with empty sleeves.
1:30:33|1:30:40|He walked with a limp due to his injuries, slowly approaching [Pei Liang]. Officials and musicians all bowed respectfully to him.
1:30:40|1:30:48|Xiaoai looked at Jingzhou's posture and clothing, knowing that yesterday's battle was extremely fierce, and couldn't help but feel heartbroken.
1:30:48|1:31:3|[Jingzhou] came to His Highness with a pensive look, gazing at [Pei Liang] for a long time. Then he suddenly examined the two men, Tian Zhan and Lu Yan, who were covered in rain and mud, struggling to kneel down. Weakly, he said,
1:31:14|1:31:19|[Jingzhou] gritted his teeth, supported himself on the floor with pain, slowly got up, and walked towards the empty seat next to [Xiaoai].
1:31:19|1:31:25|The civil and military officials all cast a sidelong glance, as if they had never seen the current Grand Commander in such a miserable state before.
1:31:25|1:31:30|[Jingzhou] doesn't care. He has experienced great sorrow and great joy overnight, and has long been numb.
1:31:30|1:31:42|Choosing to return to [Pei State] was also because there was still a mystery in his heart that needed to be solved. In addition, the presence of [Xiaoai] was also a major reason he couldn't let go of [Pei State]. As he walked to the lady's side, he took off the hat on his head.
1:31:42|1:31:46|Sitting down after throwing it aside, [Ziyu] looked sideways at Xiaoai and said slowly.
1:31:53|1:31:59|Lu Yan saw the two finish their conversation and felt the hall was a bit stuffy, so he stood up and raised his cup.
1:32:19|1:32:33|Although not knowing [Pei Liang]'s intentions, but unable to defy the imperial decree, the officials rose and prepared to take their leave in confusion. In the hall, [Pei Liang] waved his hand, stopping [Jingzhou] and [Xiaoai] who were also about to leave, indicating for them to remain seated and not to depart.
1:32:33|1:32:47|Seeing Lu Yan leaving nervously, [Pei Liang] called out to him and Lu Yan stopped, standing in front of the hall, bowing and waiting.
1:32:47|1:32:52|Tian Zhanlue thought for a moment, knowing the intention of the lord, and then left the main hall.
1:32:52|1:32:57|Lu Yan seemed to have concerns, standing in the hall, not as leisurely as before.
1:32:57|1:33:4|As the palace gates closed, [Pei Liang] carried a bowl of imperial wine and slowly walked towards Lord Lu Yan, standing in front of him and speaking.
1:33:45|1:33:58|At the moment when Lu Yan was speechless, [Pei Liang] flashed his knife and sealed the throat with a sword in the hall, only then did they realize that the father and son [Yang Cang] were aware of every move, this sentence refers to Lu Yan.
1:33:58|1:34:11|Watching the treacherous man lying on the ground gasping for breath, [Pei Liang] chuckled and turned to look at [Jingzhou] and [Xiaoai] on the platform, then he spoke.
1:34:32|1:34:39|[Pei Liang]'s pent-up frustration found its release on this treacherous minister, as he repeatedly wielded his sword to extinguish the last glimmer of hope for Lu Yan.
1:36:59|1:37:7|While Pei Liang was teasing the two, a ghost-faced soldier carried a black box and walked behind the screen in the hall.
1:37:18|1:37:26|Seeing the object in the soldier's hand, the three of them had different thoughts, and [Pei Liang] was naturally excited.
1:37:26|1:37:36|Although Xiaoai did not feel ashamed of Ziyu's actions, she found it hard to let go of the past, feeling nothing but sorrow. She watched as the ghost-faced soldier placed the black box on the table, then stepped aside to stand guard.
1:37:37|1:37:41|[Jingzhou] watched coldly, with neither joy nor sorrow in his eyes.
1:37:41|1:37:50|[Pei Liang] walked to the side of the black box, then turned to look at [Jingzhou], took a deep breath, and slowly began to speak.
1:38:1|1:38:28|After saying that, he reached out to open the black box, only to find it empty. Almost at the same time, a long sword pierced through his chest, blood gushing out, arrows shot into the black box. [Pei Liang] staggered and fell to the ground. Behind him, the ghost-faced soldier held a long sword, hunched over, looking at him helplessly gasping for breath. Watching [Pei Liang] coughing up blood, the ghost-faced soldier leaned on the sword and let out a sinister laugh.
1:38:28|1:38:35|[Xiaoai] looked at his appearance and smile, and knew that this person must be [Ziyu], for a moment he was stunned and speechless.
1:38:35|1:38:41|Watch as the soldier, staggering and on the verge of collapse, hurriedly removes the ghost mask from his face and gasps for breath, just as Xiaoai predicted, it is indeed Ziyu.
1:39:48|1:39:58|Pei Liang, who was on the verge of death, trembled all over upon hearing Ziyu's words, opening and closing his mouth as if he wanted to explain but was unable to speak.
1:40:10|1:40:19|[Jingzhou], lost in thought, was interrupted by [Ziyu].
1:40:26|1:40:35|Listening to his difficult words and watching the long sword thrown beside him, [Jingzhou] suddenly felt a hint of conspiracy permeating the hall, and couldn't help but be extra cautious.
1:40:35|1:40:42|Seeing [Jingzhou] standing still, [Ziyu] calmed his breath, lowered his head lost in thought, and slowly spoke.
1:41:5|1:41:9|Xiaoai and Jingzhou exchanged a glance, both unaware of Ziyu's intentions.
1:41:12|1:41:19|With another loud shout, [Jingzhou] struggled to his feet and dragged himself towards [Pei Liang].
1:41:19|1:41:31|In the astonished gaze of [Xiaoai], [Jingzhou] limped to [Pei Liang]'s side. Behind him, [Ziyu] sat on the throne, clutching his chest and gasping for breath, his face obscured by looking down.
1:41:31|1:41:38|The one beneath him, [Pei Liang], was already soaked in blood, unable to speak with blood pulsing in his throat, only staring in horror with his eyes.
1:41:38|1:41:43|Just as [Jingzhou] picked up the long sword at his feet, he suddenly felt a strong sense of killing intent behind him.
1:41:43|1:42:9|Just crawled out from the sea of blood and corpses, he knew clearly that the murderous aura came from [Ziyu]. Sure enough, as he pretended to be about to strike down [Pei Liang], [Ziyu] behind him fiercely stabbed towards him with a long sword. Fortunately, he was on guard and countered with a sword thrust, piercing through [Ziyu]'s chest and abdomen. Then he turned around and stabbed 5 more times, killing [Ziyu] in a blur of blood and flesh, prompting a gasp from [Xiaoai]. Gently pulling out the sword,
1:42:9|1:42:20|[Ziyu], who was already covered in mud, collapsed on the ground. [Xiaoai] covered her eyes, nose, and mouth with her long sleeves, looking at the scene in disbelief. [Jingzhou] looked at the two people lying in front of him, a plan forming in his mind.
1:42:20|1:42:25|He picked up the eerie mask by his feet and slowly pressed it towards Ziyu's face.
1:42:25|1:42:32|[Jingzhou] ignored his hoarse and frantic growls, locking the ghost mask tightly above the hangar.
1:42:32|1:42:40|He then bent down and said, "Even without a real body, there is still a shadow."
1:42:42|1:42:58|[Ziyu], who was already weak due to a hidden illness, first fought against the soldiers sent by [Pei Liang] today, barely surviving. Then he forced himself to the main hall to ambush [Pei Liang], and finally was hit by 6 swords from [Jingzhou].
1:42:58|1:43:6|At this moment, he was already lifeless, his breath was weak under the ghostly face, [Ziyu] struggled to breathe and soon passed away.
1:43:6|1:43:13|Before he died, what appeared in front of his eyes was the scene of last night where [Jingzhou] and [Xiaoai] were intimate, perhaps this was the main reason for his determination to kill the shadow.
1:43:13|1:43:21|Jingzhou then staggered to Pei Liang's side and crouched down on the ground, whispering softly.
1:43:24|1:43:30|After speaking, [Jingzhou] grabbed [Pei Liang]'s head and dragged it towards [Ziyu], seemingly without any intention of calling for a doctor.
1:43:30|1:43:45|[Pei Liang], despite his resistance, was numb from the wound that pierced his chest and abdomen, allowing [Jingzhou] to do as he pleased. He sat on the ground, leaning [Pei Liang] against his chest, while [Jingzhou], at the end of his strength, struggled to drag him to [Ziyu]'s side.
1:43:45|1:43:50|Xiaoai sat there in a daze, seemingly still unable to break free from the shadow of [Jingzhou] killing her own husband.
1:43:50|1:43:58|Although she did not know what [Jingzhou] intended to do, judging from his blood-stained clothes and fierce gaze, she could tell that he must have bloody intentions.
1:43:58|1:44:10|[Jingzhou] was crouching between [Pei Liang] and [Ziyu], picking up a long sword and gesturing a few times towards [Pei Liang]. Seeing [Jingzhou] acting like this, how could [Pei Liang] not know what [Jingzhou] was thinking at the moment.
1:44:10|1:44:18|He struggled immediately, and saw [Jingzhou] grabbing his throat, stabilizing his body, and inch by inch stabbing the long sword into [Pei Liang]'s body.
1:44:18|1:44:24|Xiaoai, on the side, had never seen such a scene before. She was already crouched on the ground, avoiding eye contact, not daring to look any longer.
1:44:24|1:44:31|[Jingzhou] at this moment has solved the mystery in his heart, realizing that the black-clothed assassin who tried to kill his mother and himself was likely sent by [Ziyu].
1:44:31|1:44:45|Pei Liang, upon learning of this news, made some arrangements and dispatched his soldiers to secretly spy on and protect the old mansion in Jingzhou. However, if Ziyu's mother does not die and the assassins sent by Ziyu do not appear, Pei Liang's words will lack credibility.
1:44:45|1:44:50|Poor Ziyu's mother died inexplicably at home, becoming a victim of the power struggle between the ruler and his ministers.
1:44:50|1:44:55|[Jingzhou] sets the scene to make it look like ghost soldiers are assassinating [Pei Liang].
1:44:55|1:45:6|Then he stood up, took a deep breath, and walked towards Xiaoai. Seeing Jingzhou, who was covered in blood and almost unrecognizable, limping towards him, Xiaoai was so scared that he could hardly speak.
1:45:6|1:45:13|[Jingzhou] watched as [Xiaoai] hurriedly avoided him, the hand that wanted to touch his cheek, the smile on his face suddenly froze.
1:45:13|1:45:20|He also knew that his current strong presence scared Xiaoai, so he hurriedly searched for something from his arms.
1:45:20|1:45:28|Finally, he pulled out the snow plum sachet given to him by [Xiaoai] from his close pocket, only to find it already soaked in horrifying blood.
1:45:28|1:45:40|[Jingzhou] quickly wiped the blood on his palm and handed the sachet to [Xiaoai]. Feeling the warmth of the sachet in her hand, [Xiaoai] was speechless. Faced with [Jingzhou], she felt extremely conflicted.
1:45:40|1:45:49|Looking at the broken and blood-stained body in front of her, tears silently fell from the corner of her eyes. [Jingzhou] gave [Xiaoai] a deep look, then forced herself to stand up.
1:45:49|1:45:58|He knew that things were not yet finished here, and he still needed to do something. In the current world, there was no longer the King of Pei, nor [Ziyu].
1:45:58|1:46:3|There is only one commander in the world from now on, and the life of being controlled by others has finally come to an end.
1:46:3|1:46:13|He picked up the seven-foot long sword carried by [Pei Liang] and walked unsteadily towards the hall. Behind him, [Xiaoai] tightly held the embroidered pouch to her chest.
1:46:13|1:46:25|The gaze followed [Jingzhou] as he gradually moved away, his resolute and weary figure. The person in front of them killed the ruler of the Pei Kingdom, killed her own husband. Thinking of this, [Xiaoai] felt her heart in turmoil, not knowing how to face it.
1:46:26|1:46:31|[Jingzhou] opened the palace door and walked out, attracting the attention of Tian Zhan and the civil and military officials.
1:46:31|1:46:38|When they saw [Jingzhou] holding the long sword belonging to [Pei Liang] and dripping with blood, they immediately started discussing animatedly.
1:46:38|1:46:45|[Jingzhou] stared at [Tian Zhan] in front of him, took a deep breath, and loudly declared.
