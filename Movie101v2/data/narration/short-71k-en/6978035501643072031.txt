0:0:49|0:1:14|Bombers dropped bombs one after another, landing on the battlefield, where soldiers were blown up and shattered on the spot. Meanwhile, [Mu Liangfeng], who was dozing off in the woods, was awakened by an annoying fly. As smoke billowed on the battlefield and faced with the enemy's carpet bombing, the only option was to flee. Unconcerned on a tree branch, [Mu Liangfeng] woke up from a beautiful dream, his remarkable eyesight immediately spotting the prey's location.
0:1:14|0:1:50|A wild boar foraging, aiming his hunting rifle at the prey about to pull the trigger, when a plane crashes, casting a huge shadow over the treetops. [Mu Liangfeng] on the tree is also shaken down. The plane grazes the treetops and crashes on the hillside. [Mu Liangfeng], getting up, quickly goes after the startled wild boar.
0:1:52|0:2:18|He pulled the trigger but missed, the wild boar was rampaging in the woods. Another shot hit the boar in the neck, causing it to fall down stiff. As he approached the boar, he noticed the situation with the plane. Looking over, he saw someone climbing out of the fiery wreckage. [Mu Liangfeng] abandoned the boar in front of him and hurried towards the hillside.
0:2:18|0:2:39|In the cockpit of the plane, a foreigner crawled out with blood all over his face. He vaguely saw a figure rushing towards him. [Mu Liangfeng] ran up quickly, slid down beside him, took out a dagger to cut the safety belt. The fire near the plane's fuel tank grew bigger and bigger. [Mu Liangfeng] didn't dare to be careless. Finally, the safety belt was cut. He grabbed the foreign pilot's shoulder and dragged him out.
0:2:39|0:2:50|Unexpectedly noticing the pistol held by the pilot, [Mu Liangfeng] picked up the pistol and kicked it into his arms. A buzzing sound came from the fuel tank. He struggled to prop up the pilot's arm and ran down the hillside.
0:2:56|0:3:1|The huge impact of the explosion knocked the two people over, blasting piles of propaganda out of the cabin.
0:3:1|0:3:5|Mu Liangfeng slowly got up from the haystack.
0:3:7|0:3:24|The intense explosion left him dizzy. On a nearby haystack, the barely conscious pilot was pleading for help towards [Mu Liangfeng]. [Mu Liangfeng] glanced at him but ignored him. However, as he took a few steps, he saw the half-dead wild boar and turned back.
0:3:25|0:3:32|After the pilot shouted, he lay still. [Mu Liangfeng] glanced at the wild boar, then at him, struggled for a moment, and walked towards the foreign pilot.
0:3:32|0:3:58|He grabbed his arm, hung it over his shoulder, and twisted his waist with force. [Mu Liangfeng] painfully supported his waist and stood up, fiercely kicked the unconscious pilot, then lifted his two legs and dragged him. Bullets from a sniper rifle fell one by one, slowly revealing the title: "Wolves Everywhere". In Fengling Ferry Town, the main road into town was bustling.
0:3:58|0:4:7|In the crowd, everyone was carrying their belongings, including some injured soldiers. [Mu Liangfeng] was carrying a pilot and catching up with the crowd.
0:4:27|0:4:44|A woman handed the coachman some banknotes. In the small town, the sign of the Smoke Willow Tea House gradually became clear. After a lot of effort, the coachman finally pushed the carriage into the tea house. In the night of the tea house, [Mu Liangfeng] held a hunting rifle but couldn't chamber a round.
0:5:21|0:5:29|[Liu Yan] turned and went into the inner room, where several patients were lying on the makeshift beds.
0:5:34|0:5:38|Mu Liangfeng in the outer room looked at Liu Yan, sneaking bites of the pastries on the table while trying to secretly stuff some into his arms.
0:5:41|0:5:55|Outside the teahouse, heavy rain poured down, while inside the teahouse, it was a mess with refugees lying around. Among them was [Mu Liangfeng], who lay in bed playing with the pistol he had acquired during the day. He liked the gun very much and even chuckled, polishing it until it shone brightly.
0:5:56|0:6:9|In the bed, he wriggled his body, vigorously wiping the gun barrel with his cuff, causing the tea house waitress to cough. [Mu Liangfeng] turned over, afraid of disturbing others. Just as he was about to take out the gun to play with it, he saw a little boy.
0:6:13|0:6:29|The sudden voice startled Mu Liangfeng, causing him to drop the gun in his hand. He quickly turned around to pick up the gun and bullets to hand them over to the person speaking. Yes, it was the pilot who had woken up.
0:6:51|0:7:8|The pilot handed the pistol to [Mu Liangfeng], saying, [Mu Liangfeng] took the pistol with delight, removed the magazine, reloaded it, and under the bright moonlight, [Mu Liangfeng] observed the exquisite gun body.
0:7:14|0:7:36|In the field, [Mu Liangfeng] held the gun with one arm, and John placed an eggshell on the gun barrel. There was also a brick tied to [Mu Liangfeng]'s arm with a rope, which was John's deliberate training to improve his gun stability. Next came the shooting segment, [Mu Liangfeng] raised his hand, aimed the gun, and fired in one go.
0:7:38|0:8:6|In the distance, not a single tomato on the scarecrow's arms was hit. John took the gun, holding it in one hand and supporting it with the other, his movements natural and relaxed. [Mu Liangfeng] shook his head in confusion. John held the gun with both hands, smoothly sliding them left and right, like a graceful waltz. Suddenly, he accelerated, shattering the tomato into pieces. He looked towards [Mu Liangfeng].
0:8:8|0:8:14|[Mu Liangfeng] was completely convinced by this teacher. That afternoon, John had just thrown his luggage onto the off-road vehicle.
0:8:25|0:8:53|[Mu Liangfeng] ran over with a small teacup in his hands and knelt down on one knee. [Liu Yan] followed suit with a gesture of invitation. John picked up the teacup with both hands, took a sip, and then helped [Mu Liangfeng] up along with [Liu Yan]. He sincerely said, [Mu Liangfeng] tightly held John's hand and shook it vigorously to express his reluctance. John put his arm around his shoulder and patted him a few times, and [Mu Liangfeng] imitated the action. The two men together conveyed their pure emotions.
0:8:53|0:8:56|The car started.
0:8:56|0:9:2|Mu Liangfeng gets on the car, marking the end of this brief yet profound friendship. He waves his hand,
0:9:3|0:9:10|John in the car took a photo of the two and waved to them, fate made people of different identities become good friends and mentors.
0:9:10|0:9:15|[Liu Yan] took the lead to go back to take care of the teahouse, leaving behind the clueless [Mu Liangfeng].
0:10:25|0:10:31|Mu Liangfeng stabbed his thigh with a knife,
0:10:34|0:10:59|Mu Liangfeng dodged the teapot thrown by the soldier, slashed another one rushing towards him, then got punched and knocked down. As more soldiers swarmed in, Mu Liangfeng found himself overwhelmed by four against two. Despite managing to throw one soldier halfway out the window, he couldn't defend against a sneak attack with a stool, ending up falling under the table. At that moment, another soldier emerged from behind, grabbing his neck and dragging him backwards.
0:11:0|0:11:6|Knocking over the teapot and causing the tea set to fall to the ground, [Mu Liangfeng] quickly found himself subdued by the soldiers.
0:11:27|0:11:52|A group of soldiers pressed [Mu Liangfeng] towards the truck without hesitation. [Liu Yan] and the teahouse waiter could only watch helplessly as [Mu Liangfeng] was taken away. The truck slowly drove out of the small town, with beautiful scenery in the mountains and a tranquil lakeside. Sheep grazed leisurely, and two military trucks raced along the mountain road. The long journey made the soldier guarding [Mu Liangfeng] doze off, but [Mu Liangfeng] was alert at this moment, staring intently at the sniper rifle in the soldier's hands.
0:11:53|0:11:59|The soldier struck [Mu Liangfeng] in the face with a punch, then stabbed his knife into the wooden box to show his power.
0:11:59|0:12:13|The truck just drove up the hill when it encountered an accident. The truck driver was shot dead, and then the truck lost power and crashed into a small river. Inside the truck, [Mu Liangfeng] and the soldiers were thrown around. The soldiers jumped out of the truck one after another, trying to transfer to another vehicle.
0:12:13|0:12:23|Mu Liangfeng, who was in the car, was puzzled as he looked around. Two soldiers were shot and killed as soon as they got off the car and fell into the small river. The captain next to another truck opened the door and lay down, followed closely by the soldiers.
0:12:31|0:12:46|A soldier protecting him was shot in the head, and before dying, he handed the gun to [Mu Liangfeng]. Another truck driver was also killed, and a brave soldier leaned against the truck, waiting for the right moment to counterattack.
0:12:47|0:13:6|As soon as the words fell, a shot hit him in the head, followed by another shot that blew his brains out. Inside the carriage, [Mu Liangfeng] realized the seriousness of the situation. He used a small knife stuck in a wooden box to continuously rub the hemp rope around his wrist. Two trucks tilted on the side of the road, soldiers looked tense, not daring to make any rash moves. The captain held a gun and slowly shifted position, observing the enemy through the window.
0:13:7|0:13:21|He initially judged that the enemy was on the opposite mountain. Soldier Xiao Fang lost his life to save Mu Liangfeng, who had just untied himself in the carriage. He quickly picked up the sniper rifle on the ground.
0:13:23|0:13:32|The soldier received orders, took a deep breath, and dashed along the riverbank, but was still shot in the head by the enemy.
0:13:42|0:13:52|The captain, in a fit of anger, kicked him down. Inside the carriage, [Mu Liangfeng] used a small knife to cut open the cloth curtain, then slowly handed out the muzzle of the sniper rifle. [Mu Liangfeng] searched for the enemy on the opposite hill through the scope.
0:13:58|0:14:23|The two soldiers rushed out, one after the other, and he ran a few steps and lay down by the river. [Mu Liangfeng] loaded the sniper rifle, while the other soldier slowly moved by the carriage. [Mu Liangfeng] licked his index finger and placed it on the trigger, then slowly lowered the muzzle, aiming at a huge rock. He remained calm and composed, waiting for the best moment to shoot. The enemy's scope was constantly monitoring the situation of the truck, and a black dot faintly appeared among the ordinary weeds, precisely at the enemy's muzzle.
0:14:23|0:14:49|Even if you get close, it's hard to notice. At this moment, wearing camouflage, he is staring intently at the truck in the distance. The soldiers behind the truck are in position. With the captain's command, two soldiers run along the stream, and [Mu Liangfeng] lying in ambush in the car sees the muzzle flame. He holds his breath, focuses, pulls the trigger. The Japanese soldiers in the jungle pop out and flee after being shot. Another shot, and a Japanese soldier who just ran a few steps in the distance falls to the ground. Almost hit, [Mu Liangfeng] crouches, takes two quick steps, jumps out of the car, and lands in the stream.
0:14:49|0:15:12|He recalled John teaching him the fusion of marksmanship and speed, and with the first shot he hit the ambushed sniper. The enemy decisively changed tactics, jumping out of the woods and running along the hillside while shooting. [Mu Liangfeng] also maneuvered by the stream, and in the end, he outplayed the opponent. Even facing the enemy he had shot down, [Mu Liangfeng] remained vigilant, aiming with his sniper rifle.
0:15:12|0:15:23|Until he confirmed the loss of breath, [Mu Liangfeng] only then took his hand off the trigger. He slowly lowered the sniper rifle, and suddenly a bullet hit the enemy's head. [Mu Liangfeng] turned around, it turned out to be the captain.
0:15:25|0:15:29|Mu Liangfeng hesitated for a moment with the gun, then reluctantly put down the sniper rifle.
0:15:29|0:15:47|In the training camp at night, soldiers were practicing shooting. [Mu Liangfeng] was being closely guarded inside the house. As he looked outside, soldiers were carrying wounded comrades on stretchers. The battle during the day was only a narrow victory. At that moment, the camp leader accompanied another officer as they walked over.
0:16:5|0:16:30|The captain snatched the gun from the guard, chambered a round, and pressed it against his head. [Mu Liangfeng] stood his ground, staring straight at the captain. The captain handed the gun back to the guard, saying, "Apparently, [Mu Liangfeng] is more interested in guns."
0:16:48|0:16:54|The captain walked over at this time, the sniper company commander stepped forward and saluted, and the captain returned the salute.
0:17:30|0:17:36|After Meng Zi slung the gun on his back, he grabbed Mu Liangfeng's arms and placed Mu Liangfeng's hands in his own palms.
0:17:50|0:18:8|[Meng Zi] hits [Mu Liangfeng]'s hand after every sentence he says. This time, [Mu Liangfeng] was clever and managed to dodge it again.
0:18:9|0:18:24|Meng Zi said, showing a relieved smile, Mu Liangfeng still pouted angrily, looking at Meng Zi, he recalled that someone used to play this game with him when he was young. Meng Zi had to admit that he did see potential in Mu Liangfeng. Then he turned and walked to the captain's side and said:
0:19:15|0:19:31|[Mu Liangfeng] listened in on the battle deployment. On this day, the flag of Japanese militarism fluttered in the wind, and the Japanese troops were training in the alleys of Jingzhou City, while the prisoner-of-war camp next to it was still giving a speech.
0:19:46|0:20:6|A group of soldiers are executing prisoners, and the Nationalist soldiers among the crowd are filled with sorrow but cannot act out. The announcer looks embarrassed, gazing at the prisoners below the stage. The prisoners, each wearing different clothes, all have the same sign hanging around their necks, indicating their crimes. A Japanese soldier takes advantage of the inspection to touch a woman in a qipao, even reaching into her skirt.
0:20:6|0:20:30|The woman's husband arrived but was hit in the face with the butt of a gun. The Japanese soldier next to him grabbed [Mu Liangfeng], searched his body. The camp leader not far away was secretly anxious, the Japanese soldier checking carefully from top to bottom. A military vehicle arrived, and the person sitting inside was the target. [Mu Liangfeng] standing for inspection made eye contact with him until the Japanese soldier approved the passage. The camp leader finally breathed a sigh of relief in the crowd.
0:20:49|0:21:10|The nurse who was bandaging wounds saw Zheng Ye standing at the door. She walked quickly towards him, and Zheng Ye, with a smile on his face, looked at her. The nurse asked why Zheng Ye, who should be in Jingshan, came here. Zheng Ye did not answer, but took out a paper cherry blossom from behind. The Japanese soldiers who were treating the wounded looked gloomy. Outside the door, Zheng Ye stretched out his hands from behind, holding a gift, and wished the nurse a happy birthday.
0:21:27|0:21:30|But when asked about this unpleasant matter, it immediately triggered memories of the night when [Zheng Ye] carried out the execution.
0:21:58|0:22:5|[Zheng Ye] stood still, his face twisted in a grimace. The nurse put the gift he brought on the bench next to him and walked away.
0:22:5|0:22:15|In the evening, in the corridor, the angry [Zheng Ye] shouted loudly at the small nurse walking towards the ward, accusing her of being unfaithful. Later that night on the streets of Jingzhou, the Japanese patrol marched in unison.
0:22:25|0:22:49|Inside the iron gate is a granary, the platoon leader tears open the jute bags containing grain, and rice pours out. He reaches in and takes out a sniper rifle prepared in advance to hand it to the soldiers. [Mu Liangfeng] takes the rifle, eagerly tearing open the wrapped parchment. [Meng Zi] distributes target photos to everyone, and [Mu Liangfeng], upon receiving the photo, looks somewhat displeased.
0:22:54|0:23:1|[Mu Liangfeng] approached the platoon leader and said discontentedly:
0:23:25|0:23:34|After [Meng Zi] finished speaking, he reached out to grab the sniper rifle from [Mu Liangfeng]. He held onto the gun tightly and didn't give him a chance. [Meng Zi] pulled out a photo from his pocket and threw it in.
0:23:40|0:24:3|The scene shifts, [Meng Zi] pushes his bicycle to the front of the old building, while the soldiers quickly run up the stairs. Outside the building is the Japanese patrol team, as the soldiers search for suitable sniping positions.
0:24:5|0:24:32|This old building happens to overlook the Japanese headquarters across the street. [Mu Liangfeng] is leaning on the windowsill with a gun in hand, looking out. At this moment, Xiao Wu walks up the tower's spiral staircase. Upstairs, Xiao Wu, who is on night duty, sees [Mu Liangfeng] at the window. [Mu Liangfeng] is moving the gun up, down, left, and right, practicing the shooting technique John taught him. Inside the room, [Meng Zi] is sitting in a chair, holding a gun, with a cigarette in hand, looking carefully as if reminiscing about his military career.
0:24:32|0:24:56|Under the window sill, [Mu Liangfeng] secretly applied lipstick to himself. Tonight, the moon was bright in the sky, with no wind or clouds. [Mu Liangfeng] tilted his head and stood by the bed, gazing at the night sky. Suddenly, he remembered the pastry he had secretly brought from the teahouse. He reached into his pocket and took it out. This treat was a rare delicacy for him. Just as he put the pastry to his mouth, [Mu Liangfeng] noticed some movement outside.
0:24:57|0:25:11|He looked through the scope of the gun and saw a figure in white on the stairs of the Japanese headquarters in the distance. As he heard a noise behind him, he immediately turned around, even dropping the pastry on the ground.
0:25:15|0:25:22|Xiao Wu divided the sweet potato in half and handed one half to [Mu Liangfeng]. [Mu Liangfeng] took the sweet potato awkwardly and said:
0:27:38|0:27:46|Seeing Xiao Wu so relieved, [Mu Liangfeng] also smiled. The next day,
0:27:46|0:27:52|On the old building, Xiao Wen, dressed in a small suit, holding a sniper rifle with a loaded barrel, closely watches the Japanese army headquarters.
0:27:53|0:28:9|At the same time, Sergeant [Meng Zi] found a high point. He crouched behind the pigeon cage, with the barrel of his gun poking through the iron mesh of the cage, focusing intently on the movements across the way. On the other side, [Mu Liangfeng] was feeling sleepy due to keeping watch. Although he had a gun propped up by the window, he was already starting to feel drowsy.
0:28:9|0:28:16|Meng Zi in the pigeon cage pulls the trigger and waits for the opportunity. The streets of Jingzhou are sparsely populated.
0:28:16|0:28:20|A faintly chilling atmosphere permeated the air.
0:28:20|0:28:44|At this moment, the Japanese military motorcycles were leading the way, followed by a luxury car slowly approaching. The prominent flag of Japanese militarism fluttered in the wind. Inside the old building, [Mu Liangfeng] was dozing off, his face almost hitting the gun butt. Suddenly, he woke up, lifted his head, and saw the target vehicle slowly stopping at the entrance of the Japanese military headquarters. [Meng Zi] placed his index finger on the trigger, waiting for the opportunity as the target got off the car.
0:28:44|0:29:8|Mu Liangfeng, with a loaded gun, stared into the distance. He licked his index finger and placed it on the trigger, while keeping his sight aimed at Liu Yan's head. His comrades also aimed at their targets. Just then, Liu Yan, who had gotten off the car, noticed an open window in the old building across the street. He then returned to the car to search for something.
0:29:11|0:29:25|On the high platform, four Japanese soldiers drew their swords and shouted "Long live the Emperor." Unexpectedly, [Liu Yan] only found a telescope from the car. Through the telescope, he spotted [Mu Liangfeng] hiding in the building. He immediately reported to the Japanese soldiers. Worried that the Japanese soldiers would escape, [Mu Liangfeng] immediately opened fire.
0:29:27|0:29:57|On another building, [Xiao Wen] also pulled the trigger, completely disrupting the plan. At this point, [Meng Zi] also bravely charged forward. [Mu Liangfeng] pulled the bolt and aimed at the enemy. After the gunshot, the Japanese officers fell one by one, and they also spotted the group's location. The Japanese soldiers aimed and opened fire at the target. [Xiao Wen] cursed under his breath and ran away with the platoon leader. Reluctantly, [Mu Liangfeng] aimed at the officer inside the car.
0:29:58|0:30:21|A shot pierced through his skull, [Xiao Wen] quickly flew down the stairs, casually throwing away the sniper rifle on the rooftop. The street was in chaos, with the people hiding in all directions. At the door, [Xiao Shun] noticed that the Japanese troops had arrived, and they suffered a big loss when they turned around and ambushed the invading Japanese soldiers. With [Xiao Shun] providing cover, [Meng Zi] flipped down from the stairs to avoid the bullets. At this moment, as he was about to descend the stairs, [Mu Liangfeng] noticed that the enemies had already arrived downstairs.
0:30:24|0:30:48|With just one shot fired, he was suppressed by enemy fire. The alarm was sounded, and [Xiao Wen] escaped to the edge of the rooftop, looking down. [Xiao Shun], pushing a bicycle, called out to him. Without hesitation, [Xiao Wen] flipped outside the building, slid down a tight banner, but unexpectedly, the Japanese soldiers arrived. Quick-witted [Xiao Shun] fired first, while [Xiao Wen] held onto the banner with one hand and pulled out his gun to shoot with the other. However, the Japanese soldiers charged forward with submachine guns blazing, breaking the banner.
0:30:48|0:31:3|[Xiao Shun] hid behind the wooden box and counterattacked, but at this moment, [Xiao Wen] without the banner fell from the sky. Fortunately, he landed on the soft soil of the construction site. [Xiao Shun] quickly ran over to help him up, and the two rushed towards the bicycle that was prepared in advance, pushing it to make their escape.
0:31:3|0:31:26|In the Japanese army headquarters office, a guard ran in to wake up the drunken lieutenant. The lieutenant on the chair opened his eyes groggily, then after a moment of reaction, he heard the alarm clearly. He immediately got up and went to the balcony, where he saw civilians fleeing and a pursuing Japanese soldier being shot down. The lieutenant walked quickly back into the room and clapped his hands. The guard threw a sniper rifle to him from a distance, and the lieutenant caught it. He went to the balcony, aimed the rifle, and...
0:31:28|0:31:36|[Xiao Shun] and [Xiao Wen] are riding a bike, pushing and fighting at the same time. Shao Zuo has already locked onto him.
0:31:43|0:32:2|[Xiao Shun] was shot in the head and lost his breath. As the pursuing Japanese soldiers arrived, [Xiao Wen]'s marksmanship was extraordinary. After killing two Japanese soldiers in a row, he attempted to drag [Xiao Shun] away. With the Japanese soldiers firing at full force, [Xiao Wen] could only save himself and escape. One soldier was targeted, and the lieutenant colonel once again pulled the trigger, taking his life.
0:32:3|0:32:11|[Meng Zi] shouted as he and the soldier ran with the bicycle, only to be surrounded at a corner. [Meng Zi] raised his hand and shot two enemies dead.
0:32:11|0:32:30|Unexpectedly, a military motorcycle approached, with a soldier holding a submachine gun firing wildly. Taking cover behind a pillar, [Meng Zi] suddenly lay down and shot him dead. The motorcycle lost control and crashed into the roadside. Seizing the opportunity, Meng Zi and the others fled into the hospital. As they ran frantically through the corridors, they hadn't found their way yet when the Japanese motorcycle smashed through the glass and charged in. They had no choice but to turn around and run.
0:32:30|0:32:39|The Japanese army discovered them and began shooting wildly. The walls of the hospital were riddled with bullet holes. Two people hid around the corner as a soldier pulled out a grenade, removed the safety pin, and threw it.
0:32:42|0:32:58|The explosion generated a huge impact, knocking over the Japanese soldiers. Seizing the opportunity, [Meng Zi] dragged a soldier and fled in another direction. Meanwhile, [Xiao Wen], sweating profusely, hid behind a wall. More and more Japanese soldiers filled the street, blocking the road and starting to search the civilians. A soldier spotted the two of them, [Meng Zi].
0:33:3|0:33:7|These two not only did not run away to meet the enemy, but quickly dealt with the enemy.
0:33:11|0:33:39|[Meng Zi] shot through the palm of the Japanese soldier, then took his life with another shot. Meanwhile, [Mu Liangfeng] was still fleeing on the rooftop. Unfamiliar with the terrain, he reached the boundary of two buildings. Looking down, he saw the Japanese soldiers passing below. With no way out, he took a deep breath and leaped off the rooftop, jumping into the window across the way. In the dimly lit corridor, [Mu Liangfeng] ran for his life, feeling like the wild boar shot by a hunting rifle at that moment.
0:33:39|0:33:52|He was panting heavily, holding a sniper rifle, running blindly. Unknowingly, he ran to a staircase about to go downstairs, where he was blocked by two Japanese soldiers. The shell casings fell with a crisp sound, like the sound of wind chimes.
0:33:52|0:33:58|In the teahouse, [Liu Yan] glanced uneasily at the wind chimes, even pausing her hands that were arranging flowers and grass.
0:33:58|0:34:11|On the other side, [Mu Liangfeng] has already escaped from the building, but the Japanese army's encirclement is right in front of him. With the limited firing speed of the sniper rifle, after firing two shots, [Mu Liangfeng] can only run away, but it's a dead end.
0:34:11|0:34:19|[Mu Liangfeng] leaned against the wall, preparing for a desperate fight. The Japanese soldiers outside were cocking their guns and approaching slowly, and [Mu Liangfeng] was also prepared for close combat.
0:34:19|0:34:39|Two Japanese soldiers quickened their pace with determination. [Mu Liangfeng] tightly gripped his gun, taking a deep breath to adjust his state. Suddenly, he looked up along the wall and saw an old lady on the second-floor window. The old lady gently moved the flowerpot on the windowsill. [Mu Liangfeng] immediately understood and nodded towards the old lady. Just as the Japanese soldiers were caught off guard, a flowerpot fell from the sky.
0:34:42|0:34:50|The two were attracted, and in an instant, [Mu Liangfeng] shot and killed one of them, while the other had a flying knife stuck in his head.
0:34:51|0:35:4|He had just stepped forward to pull out the flying knife, and the Japanese army rushed to block the north and south routes. [Mu Liangfeng] rushed into a dead end, banging on a civilian house. A hand reached out from inside the house and pulled him in.
0:35:4|0:35:15|Mu Liangfeng was about to resist, but the footsteps of the Japanese army could be heard outside the door. Everyone took Mu Liangfeng and fled, but the Japanese army was not willing to let them go easily.
0:35:15|0:35:20|They threw the body into the water and roamed the streets and alleys with military dogs.
0:35:20|0:35:30|Captain Shao picked up the shell casing left by the Nationalist Army's gunfire in the old building, examining it carefully. It was no stranger to him - the Springfield M1903 sniper rifle. The guard beside him reminded him:
0:35:45|0:36:5|The guard received orders, while Lieutenant Colonel looked out the window. Soon he spotted a clue, which was the pastry dropped by [Mu Liangfeng] last night. The Lieutenant Colonel bent down to pick up the pastry, observing it with great annoyance. In his eyes, this was a blatant provocation. The guard approached, and the Lieutenant Colonel slowly turned around. The guard presented a letter, which the Lieutenant Colonel calmly accepted.
0:36:5|0:36:14|When he noticed that it was sent by the young nurse, he opened it eagerly. The letter was written by the young nurse on the day they had a quarrel, in which she wrote:
0:36:46|0:36:51|On the other side, [Meng Zi] and the others arrived at the bamboo forest.
0:37:14|0:37:28|The remaining soldiers checked their weapons and equipment, while Xiao Wu, who was urinating not far away, spotted a light. It turned out to be the pursuers' motorcycles approaching. Xiao Wu was startled and held back his urine. [Meng Zi], who was always vigilant, looked in the direction pointed by Xiao Wu's finger.
0:37:31|0:37:52|The Japanese army noticed the movement and shouted to stop the car. The sniper team in the dark had already set up their positions, locking onto the Japanese soldiers. As the Japanese soldiers turned the motorcycle's headlight, the light swept across. Xiao Wu was caught off guard, and half of his head was exposed. [Meng Zi] took the initiative and smashed one of the Japanese car lights. In return, the Japanese soldiers opened fire, putting our troops in a passive position.
0:37:52|0:38:0|On the other side, a group of guerrillas rushed in. The ambushed Japanese soldiers quickly fell down. The last Japanese soldier had just pulled the pin of a grenade but was shot dead before he could throw it.
0:38:3|0:38:10|Hiding under the hill, [Meng Zi] and others have not figured out the situation, let alone who the newcomers are.
0:38:46|0:38:59|After the guerrilla team's instructions, they left the bamboo forest. [Meng Zi] knocked down [Mu Liangfeng] with a punch, and his comrades helped him up.
0:39:6|0:39:36|Mu Liangfeng, puzzled and annoyed, turned around. At this moment, another comrade approached, and without hesitation, Mu Liangfeng knocked him down with a punch. He then reached out to help the comrade up. The soldiers in the National Army tent applauded enthusiastically, and the captain handed a silver ticket to Meng Zi, who accepted it with both hands and saluted.
0:39:40|0:39:45|[Mu Liangfeng] had already prepared his military uniform early, waiting for tonight. A smile crept onto his lips.
0:40:6|0:40:10|[Mu Liangfeng] opened the letter in confusion, forgetting that he couldn't read.
0:41:4|0:41:18|[Mu Liangfeng] looked at Xiao Wu in confusion, while Xiao Wu raised an eyebrow curiously. A smiling A Gui on the side amused Xiao Wu, and A Gui said:
0:41:33|0:41:56|Comrades left one after another. On a beautiful day, [Mu Liangfeng] rode his bicycle back to Fenglingdu Town, where he was warmly welcomed by everyone. As he returned triumphantly to the town, even walking through the fields, he was admired by groups of children. Grandpa also walked to the door to greet him. [Mu Liangfeng], dressed in military uniform and carrying a gun on his back, ran up.
0:43:10|0:43:34|[Mu Liangfeng] turned and left. The old man stared at the burnt banknotes in the brazier, lost in thought. Just as [Mu Liangfeng] was about to leave the courtyard, the old man called out to him and chased him out the door. [Mu Liangfeng] turned around, and the old man handed him a small package. [Mu Liangfeng] carefully took it and opened it, revealing a handgun. Upon closer inspection, he realized it was the same one that belonged to John.
0:43:39|0:44:3|The old man took the gun and looked at the bullets, saying: [Mu Liangfeng] took the gun from his grandfather's hand. The old man's eyes revealed a transcendent gaze, [Mu Liangfeng] nodded, his eyes red as he slowly stepped back and left. [Mu Liangfeng] also knew that his grandson had grown up and could not be kept anymore.
0:44:3|0:44:11|On the path of Fengling Ferry, [Mu Liangfeng] rode his bicycle, pondering his grandfather's words. Suddenly, he slowed down, as if he had forgotten something important.
0:44:11|0:44:14|After stopping the car for a moment of contemplation, he turned back.
0:44:14|0:44:23|Er Wa is wiping the table in the teahouse, while Mu Liangfeng pushes a cart towards the door in the dark of night. When he reaches the entrance, Mu Liangfeng stops with his back to the door and parks his bicycle.
0:44:39|0:44:52|[Mu Liangfeng] gently placed the sniper rifle down, and at that moment, [Liu Yan] came down from the second floor. She was stunned when she saw [Mu Liangfeng] in military uniform - he looked so much like her ex-husband, it was uncanny.
0:44:53|0:45:10|[Liu Yan] thought to herself, recalling her ex-husband dancing with her at the ball. She couldn't help but say, "I'm coming down the stairs quickly," as [Mu Liangfeng] also stood up.
0:45:34|0:45:55|[Mu Liangfeng] sat down nervously, while [Liu Yan] poured hot tea. She pointed to her lips, causing [Mu Liangfeng] to blush and lower his head. [Liu Yan] brought the hot tea over and brewed another cup. [Mu Liangfeng] picked it up and drank it slowly.
0:46:8|0:46:22|[Mu Liangfeng] stood up excitedly and said, "It's pouring rain outside." He slung the sniper rifle over his shoulder and instructed, "[Er Wa], go close the door." [Mu Liangfeng] glanced at the heavy rain outside the window.
0:46:38|0:47:2|On the second floor, [Mu Liangfeng] followed [Liu Yan] into the room. He looked around at the furnishings in the room, while [Liu Yan] walked towards the inner room holding a mat. Holding a quilt, [Mu Liangfeng] was attracted by a photo, which was a picture of [Liu Yan] and her ex-husband. [Liu Yan] spread out the mat on the floor, and [Mu Liangfeng] nodded. Outside the teahouse, a torrential rain poured down with thunder rumbling. The wind chimes on the floor caught the attention of [Mu Liangfeng].
0:47:2|0:47:24|He leaned forward and looked over, behind the screen was the already asleep [Liu Yan], moonlight spilled on her delicate profile. [Mu Liangfeng] couldn't help but look a little longer. Perhaps due to the drop in temperature, the dreaming [Liu Yan] pulled the blanket, [Mu Liangfeng] slowly lay down. He couldn't help but think of the group photo today, the man in military uniform in the photo with [Liu Yan],
0:47:24|0:47:48|In the early morning sunlight, [Mu Liangfeng] slowly opened his eyes to see a beautiful pillowcase embroidered with a pair of flying swallows. The record player lay in a lovely wooden box, spinning gently. [Mu Liangfeng] lightly touched the flying swallows on the pillowcase with his fingers, where vivid swallows and blessings of happiness were depicted. [Liu Yan] sat at the table, nodding at [Mu Liangfeng].
0:47:56|0:48:21|After saying that, [Liu Yan] stood up and walked to the window, pulling open the curtains. The sunlight fell on [Mu Liangfeng]'s face, slightly dazzling. [Liu Yan]'s fingertips slid over the wind chimes, and [Mu Liangfeng] sat up. Hearing the movement, [Liu Yan] turned around. The flustered [Mu Liangfeng] quickly wrapped himself in a blanket, grabbed his pants and put them on under the blanket. When [Liu Yan] regained her composure, she saw the awkward [Mu Liangfeng] struggling to put on his pants and couldn't help but laugh.
0:48:21|0:48:35|She turned and went downstairs to spare Mu Liangfeng from further embarrassment. By noon, Er Wa brought a bicycle to Mu Liangfeng at the teahouse entrance, and Liu Yan also saw him off.
0:48:35|0:48:53|[Mu Liangfeng] shyly said, while [Liu Yan] gently hugged him at the moment of parting. [Mu Liangfeng] looked complicated, and the Nationalist soldiers drinking tea on the side watched the scene, as if worried about gossip. [Liu Yan] then stepped back.
0:48:53|0:49:2|[Liu Yan] ran into the house with her long skirt, while the Nationalist soldiers on the side were discussing their actions. [Mu Liangfeng] glared disapprovingly, causing the soldiers to immediately restrain their expressions.
0:49:2|0:49:9|[Liu Yan] ran over and handed the hunting rifle to [Mu Liangfeng], who took it. Then [Liu Yan] took out a military canteen.
0:49:20|0:49:28|[Liu Yan] helped him carry it on his body, and also helped him tidy up his clothes casually. [Mu Liangfeng] gazed at [Liu Yan] foolishly, then touched the hunting rifle and said:
0:49:38|0:49:59|[Mu Liangfeng] handed the hunting rifle with both hands, [Liu Yan] took it and saluted, [Mu Liangfeng] also followed with a standard military salute. They smiled and nodded at each other, their eyes showing reluctance and encouragement respectively. [Mu Liangfeng] mounted the bicycle, slowly rode away under [Liu Yan]'s gaze. Pedaling through the crowd, [Mu Liangfeng] felt extremely happy.
0:49:59|0:50:3|He looked back at the teahouse of [Liu Yan] and gave her a brilliant smile.
0:50:3|0:50:12|[Liu Yan] gazed foolishly at the figure's back, recalling him. The last time he left, he was also smiling. After that, he never came back.
0:50:12|0:50:33|[Liu Yan] showed a melancholy expression, feeling empty inside. She tightly held the hunting rifle left by [Mu Liangfeng], unsure of what the future held. Perhaps it was the military uniform that made it hard for her to distinguish between the two. The sound of a bell rang out, and [Liu Yan] looked up to see [Mu Liangfeng] in the crowd, who happened to be looking back at her. She stared at that figure until it disappeared at the end of the road.
0:50:35|0:50:57|On the small bridge, [Mu Liangfeng] is riding a bike and drinking from a water bottle, while on the other side, [Liu Yan] brings out a large plate of wedding cakes. Inside a tattoo shop, the tattoo artist is drawing a pair of flying swallows on [Mu Liangfeng]'s chest. Meanwhile, [Liu Yan] brings in another plate of wedding cakes from the oven. As the tattoo artist finishes the final touches, the pair of swallows on his chest looks vivid and lifelike under the afternoon sunlight. [Mu Liangfeng] finishes drinking from the water bottle.
0:50:57|0:51:26|Beside, the child mocked her. [Mu Liangfeng] put down the water pot, opened her clothes, revealing the swallow on her chest muscles, which did not scare the child. Meanwhile, [Liu Yan] was still busy. [Er Wa] came over with a tea tray and saw the pastry, blushing and shyly waving her hand to leave. This amused [Liu Yan] into laughter, as she repeatedly pressed the pastry with her palm. Suddenly, the sound of wind chimes rang out.
0:51:31|0:51:35|Looking at the table full of wedding cakes, she recalled the beautiful memories of her past.
0:51:36|0:51:46|That night at the dance party, the officers were each dancing with their partners, and their loved ones were by their side. The "喜" characters on the pastries constantly stirred up her longing and nostalgia for love.
0:51:46|0:52:2|Slightly tipsy, she embraced her lover's shoulders that night, swaying to the music. However, all of this turned into memories, fading away like bubbles. [Liu Yan] finished smashing the wedding cakes, then went to the window to wash her hands. The beautiful bracelet on her wrist gently swayed, looking quite charming.
0:52:5|0:52:30|Startled, [Liu Yan] looked up and saw that it was [Mu Liangfeng] holding a water kettle, which made her burst into laughter. Dressed in military uniform, [Mu Liangfeng] rode a bike with [Liu Yan] in a floral skirt. In the sunset, the two of them passed through a narrow alley and arrived in the fields. The long and narrow mountain road was lined with various wildflowers. Sitting in the back of the bike, [Liu Yan] embraced [Mu Liangfeng]'s shoulder, happily swaying her head. Her beautiful curly hair shone in the light, making her even more charming and delightful. She was extremely happy.
0:52:30|0:52:38|[Mu Liangfeng] riding a bike is even more so, the two of them slowly walking on the small road in the mountains,
0:53:7|0:53:14|[Liu Yan] sat with her knees hugged, looking at the young man in front of her. Suddenly, she remembered something and gazed into the distance, saying:
0:53:26|0:53:54|[Liu Yan] didn't expect him to say that. She looked at him in surprise. [Mu Liangfeng] couldn't help but smile foolishly. He took out the homemade risk of rope and eggshells. The silly boy looked at her seriously. He shook the wind chimes in his hand. [Liu Yan] reached out her hand, her fingers gently flicked, and a crisp sound rang out. She smiled as she took the wind chimes and held them close to her eyes to look at them. She hadn't received a gift for a long time.
0:53:54|0:54:4|She held the wind chime high, letting it sway in front of her. She slowly closed her eyes as a gentle breeze rustled the leaves, while the two figures sat side by side on the hillside.
0:54:13|0:54:22|The platoon leader pressed against the neck of [Mu Liangfeng],
0:54:34|0:55:0|Xiao [Mu] gasped and shouted loudly: This voice attracted the attention of many soldiers. In the rainy night forest, [Mu Liangfeng] lay inside, holding a sniper rifle. He almost fell asleep absent-mindedly. In a daze, he saw himself hunting pheasants. At that time, he only thought about bringing back more prey every day. On the other side, [Liu Yan] took down the wind chimes from under the window and hung up the shell wind chime that [Mu Liangfeng] gave her.
0:55:0|0:55:10|On the rocks by the river, the snipers lay in position. Among them, [Mu Liangfeng] gazed steadfastly into the distance, stealing a glance at the platoon leader. Seizing the opportunity, he took out the letter given to him by [Liu Yan] from his pocket.
0:55:24|0:55:42|Illiterate [Mu Liangfeng] folded the letter and threw it into the cold river, which quickly washed it away. [Mu Liangfeng] picked up his gun again, focused on the distance without distraction. He remained still, his eyes particularly determined. The platoon leader looked at him with certainty as the scene shifted to the granary in Jingzhou.
0:55:48|0:56:10|Captain Zheng led the guards over, and the secret agent immediately saluted. Captain Zheng bent down to pick up the remaining photos from the iron bucket. As he slowly stood up and examined the photos, the atmosphere in the warehouse dropped to freezing point. Captain Zheng looked at his colleague in the photo and asked for confirmation. The secret agent gave a negative answer. Enraged, Captain Zheng shot the secret agent dead. The other agent remained silent, later ordered to continue the search.
0:56:12|0:56:18|After receiving the orders, [Mu Liangfeng] quickly escaped, and the impatient Lieutenant shot the warehouse owner dead with another shot.
0:56:18|0:56:30|Soon, the Japanese army launched a full-scale attack southward, one by one major cities fell, and the number of refugees increased. Even those fleeing for their lives were not spared. As bombers flew overhead, a bomb dropped, and even the Nationalist army on the front line found it difficult to resist.
0:56:30|0:56:34|Failure and retreat are the main theme. Soldiers in the military camp are busy tidying up intelligence and preparing to withdraw.
0:57:2|0:57:32|Captain finished speaking and picked up the file bag to take the lead. On that day, sitting in the military truck compartment was [Mu Liangfeng], gritting his teeth, looking angry like a stubborn child. Xiao Wen comforted him, "Mu Liangfeng" only half understood. The children chattered, and [Liu Yan] asked with concern about the worried [Er Wa].
0:57:40|0:57:58|The military vehicle carrying the sniper squad arrived, and as [Mu Liangfeng] got off the car, he heard welcoming voices. [Liu Yan] ran to his side. [Liu Yan] quickly composed herself and said seriously:
0:58:18|0:58:41|The crowd walked towards the teahouse separately, with only [Mu Liangfeng] left behind, not favored by [Liu Yan]. As [Mu Liangfeng] gazed at [Liu Yan]'s back, [Xiao Wen] happened to come by, saying something to him before whimsically swaying his head and walking away. [Gui Ying] was using an electric grinder to polish bullet heads, slowly raising the polished bullet and carefully examining it up close.
0:58:46|0:58:53|The guard untied the handkerchief, inside were pastries identical to those dropped by [Mu Liangfeng].
0:59:55|1:0:30|In the kitchen, [Liu Yan] was still busy cutting vegetables. [Mu Liangfeng] walked in with an empty wine pot. [Liu Yan] pointed in a direction and went to stir-fry the vegetables. [Mu Liangfeng] approached with a smile and said, "[Liu Yan]" dipped her hand in the cooked vegetables, touched [Mu Liangfeng]'s lips with her fingers, but [Mu Liangfeng] did not respond. [Liu Yan] asked persistently, then poured the vegetables into the trash can.
1:0:35|1:1:4|After saying that, Liu Yan went to chop vegetables. Mu Liangfeng walked up, held her shoulders, and said Mu Liangfeng pulled open his clothes, revealing the tattoo on his chest, the pattern of a swallow facing the pillowcase. Liu Yan threw herself into his arms, then tightly hugged her beloved. The long-suppressed yearning in Liu Yan finally erupted, she embraced Mu Liangfeng's neck and kissed him passionately.
1:1:4|1:1:17|[Mu Liangfeng] hesitated for a moment, then responded warmly. In the kitchen, the two embraced passionately, filled with not only the long-awaited anticipation, but also the love that was about to burst out from the depths of their hearts. The beauty of the dance party once again climbed into [Liu Yan]'s heart.
1:1:17|1:1:35|[Mu Liangfeng] was kissing her deeply on the neck, like a drowning person greedily breathing air. Outside the quiet teahouse, it started raining again, while inside, the soldiers sat at the table checking their gear together, and the platoon leader sat behind a pillar staring at the ceiling.
1:1:35|1:2:2|He recalled that day on the battlefield, when he was just an ordinary soldier. The enemy sniper was skilled and had taken out several comrades. [Meng Zi], his brother, and the remaining comrades were hiding behind a broken wall, with [Meng Zi] pointing towards the smoke.
1:2:3|1:2:11|As soon as the younger brother put the cigarette in his mouth, [Meng Zi] also wanted to take a puff, so he said, "Brother, take the cigarette out of your mouth."
1:2:17|1:2:29|The younger brother lit a match and approached to light a cigarette for him, but was shot on the wall. The enemy sniper shot and killed the younger brother on the spot, splattering blood all over [Meng Zi]'s face. The blood dripping down his face extinguished the match.
1:2:29|1:2:38|In this scene, [Meng Zi] is unforgettable. In the teahouse, [Meng Zi] sits lonely, striking matches and flicking them from his fingertips, repeating the action, striking them bright.
1:2:53|1:3:12|Squad leader Mu Liangfeng held an unlit cigarette in his mouth, gazing out the window. He couldn't help but recall the afternoon when he played with his younger brother in the woods, messing up his hair time and time again. The match in his hand had already burned his fingers, prompting him to snap out of his reverie, flick the match backwards, and take the cigarette out of his mouth.
1:3:12|1:3:26|Outside the teahouse, the escort Ah Tian set off fireworks with the children. On a small boat on the lake, [Liu Yan] lay in the arms of [Mu Liangfeng], the sparkling lake water reflecting on their faces, exuding an indescribable beauty.
1:4:6|1:4:26|[Mu Liangfeng] gently looked at [Liu Yan] in his arms, holding her hand tighter. [Liu Yan] looked up and said:
1:4:38|1:4:53|[Mu Liangfeng] frowned and looked at [Liu Yan], saying: [Liu Yan] looked at [Mu Liangfeng] with a soft and worried expression, gently touching his cheek. It was just a brief encounter, and tomorrow would be dawn.
1:5:1|1:5:25|[Liu Yan], with beautiful eyes and a captivating gaze, under this setting, the two of them once again embrace and kiss each other. Their lips intertwine, expressing their love to each other. No one knows when they will meet again. Farewells are inevitable. As the night deepens, [Liu Yan]'s chamber is no longer lonely tonight. The soft light illuminates their faces as [Liu Yan], in a floral dress, lies on top of [Mu Liangfeng].
1:5:25|1:5:39|[Mu Liangfeng] gently embraced her slender waist, [Liu Yan] sucking on [Mu Liangfeng]'s lips. The two people occupied by love passionately expressed their emotions. [Mu Liangfeng] turned over, pressing down on [Liu Yan] like a fierce beast fiercely kissing her. [Liu Yan] reached out and touched his lips.
1:5:43|1:5:58|[Mu Liangfeng] nodded, and the next moment, four lips lightly touched. The mesmerized [Liu Yan] eagerly desired the man in front of her. She helped [Mu Liangfeng] take off his shirt, revealing his solid chest with rugged lines that highlighted his masculine charm.
1:5:58|1:6:21|Mu Liangfeng urgently unbuttoned the buttons on Liu Yan's neck, helped her remove her clothes, revealing the smooth and translucent undergarment inside. The two who had long fallen in love occupied each other's bodies on this night, love merging with emotions, evaporating through every pore on their bodies. Liu Yan, intoxicated, clung to the broad shoulders, feeling the surging and intense love. It is said that a moment of spring night is worth a thousand gold.
1:6:21|1:6:48|The morning light falls on the pillow, a gentle breeze blows, wind chimes ring, outside the teahouse on the military truck, the sniper team is waiting for [Mu Liangfeng] to return. The platoon leader is getting impatient, while Private Wu stares at the teahouse door and says: At this moment, [Mu Liangfeng] walks out with [Liu Yan]. As they approach the truck, [Liu Yan] looks up at [Mu Liangfeng] with endless tenderness and love in her eyes. [Mu Liangfeng] takes her hand and places it on his chest, then leans in to kiss [Liu Yan]'s forehead and says:
1:6:52|1:7:13|[Liu Yan] closed her eyes without saying a word, nodded, and gently touched [Mu Liangfeng]'s cheek. She looked at his resolute face affectionately, knowing that the journey ahead would be full of dangers. Thinking of this, [Mu Liangfeng] embraced [Liu Yan] and gave her a deep kiss. In this era of raging wars, love seemed so precious. Then, lifting [Meng Zi], they both climbed onto the truck and separated.
1:7:13|1:7:20|Mu Liangfeng glanced at the truck, Liu Yan nodded slightly. As they were about to leave, the two had to let go of their held hands. Mu Liangfeng walked over.
1:7:28|1:7:33|Mu Liangfeng, who got on the car, looked at the group of children and the eagerly waiting family members.
1:7:41|1:7:59|[Xiao Wen] loudly declares his love as the military truck drives away. The others wave goodbye, leaving [Liu Yan] looking desolate at the teahouse entrance. The truck speeds across the bridge, knowing that this battle will either be a success or lead to their deaths. Inside the truck, everyone's faces are solemn, understanding that only with a determination to face death can they have a chance at rebirth.
1:7:59|1:8:25|Setting off shortly, the atmosphere in the puppet army camp was lively. The sniper team rushed in with guns, kicking down the enemies. Meanwhile, in the Changde prisoner of war camp, under the flag of Japanese militarism, a line of officers drew their swords to swear allegiance. The camera captured this moment below.
1:8:25|1:8:47|In the hospital, the young nurse was leaning against the window, her head down, with a look of sadness and melancholy. She knew that soon the ward would be filled with injured soldiers. Thinking of this, she couldn't bear it and walked out of the room. Holding a megaphone, she stepped onto the stage and spoke the words she least wanted to say to the captives. Outside the barbed wire, Mu Liangfeng was also secretly watching.
1:8:56|1:9:24|A military jeep, with its lights on, slowly drives through the mountain road and stops in front of the Japanese prisoner of war camp. Japanese soldiers come forward to inspect, only to find that inside the car are disguised Nationalist soldiers. Sitting in the passenger seat, [Xiao Wen] presents a pass and greets "good evening". The Japanese soldier leans in to take a closer look and, finding nothing suspicious, signals for [Xiao Wen] to get out of the car. As [Xiao Wen] steps out and walks away, the people inside the car can't help but watch the two figures disappear into the distance.
1:9:24|1:9:48|The Japanese soldiers conducting the inspection called over their companion to carefully examine the passes. [Xiao Wen] fluently dealt with them in Japanese. At that moment, another Japanese soldier quietly lifted the rear curtain of the military vehicle and inspected it one by one. Fortunately, the sniper team was well prepared, putting captive signs on their comrades and binding their hands. After confirming that there were no abnormalities, the inspecting Japanese soldiers finally left. Meanwhile, after the inspection was over, [Xiao Wen] returned to the military vehicle and reported that everything was fine. This time, it was a narrow escape.
1:9:48|1:10:5|The military vehicle slowly drove into the gate of the prisoner-of-war camp. Inside the gate, there was a temporary playground, with a large building standing in the north and another in the east. Japanese soldiers were still training on the playground, and a strong beam of light occasionally swept across from the watchtower. The platoon leader was driving the military vehicle attentively, but unexpectedly, his vehicle brushed past the car of Lieutenant Masao.
1:10:5|1:10:31|Fortunately, there were no flaws exposed, everything was proceeding according to the previous plan. On the cliff outside the prisoner of war camp, among the dense grass, a half face could be vaguely seen in the moonlight, it was Xiao Bin who was providing cover outside. He was aiming at Meng Zi's military vehicle through the scope. The car slowly stopped, comrades got off one after another, pretending to be captured comrades were escorted, and the package containing the bomb was slung on. The group walked towards the building, and a song came through the radio.
1:10:31|1:10:41|Soldiers in the corridor leisurely trimming the flowers and plants, the sniper squad passing by, the record player indoors spinning smoothly.
1:10:41|1:10:46|In the corridor, Mu Liangfeng and others pressed the previous pseudo-soldiers into another path, which was the power supply room they were about to attack.
1:10:46|1:10:54|The group walked quickly forward, as A Tian and [A Gui] exchanged a glance, then opened the door together. The sound of the electric turbine kept going, while the platoon leader [Meng Zi] held a gun and moved forward.
1:10:58|1:11:11|The Japanese soldiers who hadn't reacted in time were taken out by [Meng Zi]. The soldiers who pretended to be captured untied the ropes, took out the prepared explosives, and began shooting the Japanese soldiers with pistols on the training ground. At the same time, A Tian found the fuse, while the Japanese soldiers pushed and shoved the prisoners of war.
1:11:11|1:11:23|Atian set up the detonator, and the Japanese soldiers lined up for the execution. The sound of gunfire frightened the young nurse in the room, and at this moment, [Meng Zi] stepped out. The puppet army pointed in a direction and began to lead the way.
1:11:23|1:11:47|The bomb at the power supply station has started counting down. In the intelligence room, the Japanese army is receiving a telegram, obviously unaware of the late-night visit by the sniper team. The telegraph operator receives urgent information, his face darkens immediately and he stands up. At the same time, the sniper team led by the pseudo army successfully arrives at the intelligence room. Passing by, the people downstairs see a Japanese soldier reporting to the commander. Upstairs, Mu Liangfeng's face changes when he hears this. He quickly walks up and pats Xiao Wen on the back.
1:11:48|1:12:18|Xiao Wu looked down towards the building, the Japanese intelligence officer finished reporting and ran towards the second floor. Just as he was going up the stairs, he was controlled from behind by [Mu Liangfeng]. Xiao Wu came forward to help, and the two dragged him into the room. Inside the room, [Mu Liangfeng] anxiously asked Xiao Wu what he had just said downstairs. Seeing no reaction from the Japanese, [Mu Liangfeng] threw a punch, while Xiao Wu pulled out his gun, released the safety, and pointed it at his head. The intelligence officer immediately softened and said:
1:12:38|1:12:49|He punched the platoon leader in the face, pulled out a gun and said, "The Japanese soldiers outside, looking through the gap opened by [Mu Liangfeng], noticed something was wrong and went to report the news."
1:13:9|1:13:22|[Mu Liangfeng] pointed the gun at his own head, and the platoon leader saw the Japanese soldiers approaching through a crack, shouting loudly: Everyone, attack!
1:13:23|1:13:49|A Japanese soldier stumbled into the broadcasting room, shouting that there were enemies infiltrating. Both soldiers and officers immediately responded upon hearing this. The officer commanded: "Trained Japanese soldiers, grab your guns and charge towards the building." A shot from a sniper rifle rang out, causing the Japanese soldier to fall to the ground. Another shot led to chaos among the Japanese soldiers, who immediately searched for Xiaobin's location. The bright searchlight shone, and Xiaobin, caught off guard, died in the crossfire.
1:13:49|1:14:10|Two more Japanese soldiers rushed up the building, [Mu Liangfeng] raised his hand and shot them dead with two shots. The platoon leader also shot dead the soldier behind the window and shouted, "[Mu Liangfeng] rushed out and picked up the enemy's submachine gun. He threw it with both hands, and the platoon leader caught it steadily. With intense gunfire, the incoming Japanese soldiers were like lambs to the slaughter. He then turned around and charged towards the main entrance downstairs, firing at the Japanese soldiers who rushed in.
1:14:10|1:14:31|The machine gun, like the scythe of death, was reaping the lives of the Japanese soldiers. With a sudden lack of bullets, more Japanese soldiers rushed in. [Sergeant] shouted loudly, while [Private] held off the suppressive fire, buying time for [Sergeant] to reload. The group fought and retreated, with [Sergeant] covering the rear by shooting outside through the railing. Soon they turned the corner of the corridor, but the rear [Sergeant] had already been shot. [A Gui] supported [Sergeant] and retreated into the room.
1:14:40|1:15:0|[Xiao Wu] dragged the nurse into the room, the record player in the broadcasting room was stuck. The group of people inside the room, who had prepared their equipment, held the nurse hostage and confronted the Japanese soldiers. The Japanese officer ordered a full retreat, while [Sergeant] estimated the time of the explosion. The group forced the Japanese soldiers to retreat while holding the nurse, and the Japanese were unwilling to take any risks until they went downstairs.
1:15:0|1:15:17|Mu Liangfeng took the lead in pulling down the flag of Japanese militarism, and when the lookout tower shone its searchlight, Mu Liangfeng shot it down with one bullet. He reloaded, and the snipers of the squad huddled closely together, facing off against dozens of Japanese soldiers below the steps. The commanding officer leading the Japanese soldiers panicked first and shouted:
1:15:17|1:15:44|The sniper team dared not be careless, tightly gripping their guns and aiming ahead. The Japanese soldiers in formation were unwilling to retreat, raising their guns to aim at the team. [Mu Liangfeng], the platoon leader, said firmly, while [A Gui] reported the time promptly. Then, he slowly approached the jeep with his submachine gun. As [A Gui] climbed into the car, the Japanese commander said fiercely:
1:15:45|1:15:52|[Sergeant] raised his hand and shot the officer dead, causing the nurse to scream in fright.
1:15:58|1:16:34|On the second floor, two snipers were aiming their guns, constantly searching for an opportunity. As the time for the explosion drew near, the Japanese soldiers remained oblivious. [Mu Liangfeng] had to open fire to suppress the enemy from advancing. With the bomb about to explode, the snipers upstairs still seized the chance. [Mu Liangfeng] shielded [A Tian] from being shot, and [A Tian] pushed [Mu Liangfeng] into the car. As the rearguard, [A Tian] was shot again.
1:16:34|1:16:42|The off-road vehicle rushed out at this moment, surrounded by the enemy. The sniper still tried to find an opportunity, with each Japanese soldier chasing forward. [Platoon Leader] took out a hand grenade, pulled the pin, and threw it out with all his might.
1:16:44|1:16:49|The explosion knocked down many Japanese soldiers, and the off-road vehicle took the opportunity to leave in a cloud of dust, disappearing into the night.
1:16:58|1:17:17|Mu Liangfeng didn't expect Meng Zi to say such serious words. The platoon leader who moved his body accidentally touched the wound, causing unbearable pain. Mu Liangfeng hurriedly stepped forward to check, saying anxiously, "The nurse was just about to come over." The platoon leader, in anger, said, "And at that moment, A Gui, who was driving, slowly released his hand covering his stomach, and upon closer inspection, it was covered in blood."
1:17:17|1:17:25|The co-pilot Xiao Wen looked at him anxiously and took out a bandage to help him press the wound, but the situation did not improve.
1:17:58|1:18:2|He recalled that night at Fengling Ferry, where beautiful fireworks bloomed in the night sky, it was so beautiful.
1:18:4|1:18:17|Saying these words, he seemed to have exhausted his last bit of strength, looking blankly into the distance. The fireworks in his memories also gradually lost their colors, and his life came to an end. He fell at that moment, and the car instantly lost control.
1:18:19|1:18:38|In the back seat, [Mu Liangfeng] propped up his body and controlled the steering wheel with Xiao Wen. The platoon leader lost consciousness in the shaking, and the medic took over Meng Zi's condition. The alarm sounded in the prisoner-of-war camp, and the soldiers anxiously said: On the other side, the car swayed and swayed on the road, with Xiao Wen in the car barely holding onto the steering wheel.
1:18:38|1:18:44|The car broke down at this moment, causing panic among the group and plunging them into a desperate situation. Meanwhile,
1:18:44|1:19:4|[Liu Yan] is tidying up her clothes and soft items. She picked up a floral long skirt and couldn't help but pause, not knowing where her beloved [Mu Liangfeng] is. Busy as she is, [Liu Yan] has actually been targeted by the lurking Shao Zuo, who is aiming a dark gun barrel from the window across the street. The person aiming is Shao Zuo, and through the scope, he sees the wind chime made by [Mu Liangfeng] gently swaying.
1:19:4|1:19:11|Zhenye seemed to be waiting for something, when [Liu Yan] turned and walked into the inner room, suddenly a burst of firecrackers broke the quiet night.
1:19:11|1:19:37|On the second floor, Mu Liangfeng looked over and saw a newlywed couple walking hand in hand across the bridge, followed by their family and friends. Mu Liangfeng stared at them coldly, feeling the festive atmosphere infecting his heart. In that moment, his heart was touched as he imagined himself and Nurse Bin Tian on the bridge. Dressed in formal attire, he gazed affectionately at the white wedding dress-clad Bin Tian. But he knew it was only a fantasy, so he closed his eyes in pain and stopped thinking about it.
1:19:38|1:19:52|When he opened his eyes, the road in the small town was filled with fleeing people. He approached the scope and looked through it, seeing [Liu Yan] in the teahouse saying to [Er Wa]:
1:20:0|1:20:6|[Liu Yan] persuaded the mother and daughter who were taken in to leave. After saying that, [Liu Yan] walked towards the second floor.
1:20:14|1:20:42|In a desperate attempt to save someone, [Mu Liangfeng] turned and ran towards the direction of the small town. At the teahouse, [Liu Yan] on the second floor walked towards the desk, opened a drawer and took out some cash. Just as she turned around, she was startled by the man in front of her, who turned out to be Zhengye, revealing a sinister smile. A sense of foreboding filled the air as the sound of wind chimes rang out ominously. Meanwhile, [Mu Liangfeng] sprinted frantically down the narrow path.
1:20:44|1:20:58|Through the fleeing crowd, with the town still far away, [Mu Liangfeng] was anxious. A group of people on horseback blocked his way.
1:21:17|1:21:36|The platoon leader in the carriage woke up sweating profusely, only to find that it was the nurse who had saved him, but [Mu Liangfeng] was nowhere to be seen. At that moment, on the small bridge of Fengling Ferry, [Mu Liangfeng] ran against the crowd and quickly arrived at the teahouse.
1:21:44|1:22:8|[Mu Liangfeng] looked around the furnishings on the second floor at this moment, finding everything neatly arranged. He noticed that the clothes on the table were only halfway tidied up, the photo in front of the desk was still there, and there was a pastry next to it. [Mu Liangfeng] quickly walked over, picked up the pastry with the imprint of [Liu Yan] Teahouse, and a sense of foreboding rose in his heart. With a gentle breeze blowing, the curtains swayed, and [Mu Liangfeng] looked out the window vigilantly.
1:22:8|1:22:40|At that moment, a bullet pierced through his palm. He lay on the ground, struggling to move, then kicked over the table to block the window. The car drove into Fengling Ferry, Xiao Wu pulled the bolt of the gun and jumped out of the car, while [Mu Liangfeng] leaned against the wall, wrapping his palm with gauze. He pulled out the handgun John gave him, holding his head and crouching as he passed through the second floor.
1:22:42|1:23:7|The sound of gunshots rang out, and the bullets seemed like the death warrants of the King of Hell. [Mu Liangfeng] accidentally stepped into the void and fell from the second floor. His pistol dropped in a corner. As he was trying to get up, Xiao Wen rushed over. Xiao Wen tried to help him up, but was pulled down by him. Xiao Wen, realizing the danger, slowly moved aside. The glass was shattered by a shot, another bullet pierced through the wooden door, grazing Xiao Wen's scalp as it flew past.
1:23:8|1:23:31|Mu Liangfeng found Liu Yan's clothes outside the door and ran towards the house. Xiao Wen got up to chase after him. Mu Liangfeng outside the house became a living target. Xiao Wen also stepped forward. While Xiao Wen was shooting back with a pistol, he quickly ran to Mu Liangfeng's side. The two hid under the steps. At this moment, the Japanese sniper team walked down from the bridge and saw this scene. They put down their guns and went to support them.
1:23:31|1:23:41|Upon hearing the whistle, the Japanese soldiers ran towards Zheng Ye. [Mu Liangfeng] struggled to get up and looked towards the second floor across, but found no enemies. The Japanese soldiers on this side reported back.
1:23:44|1:24:9|Mu Liangfeng saw Liu Yan's clothes scattered on the ground one by one. He quickly got up and Xiao Wen followed. Mu Liangfeng held the gun and followed the route of the discarded clothes. Xiao Wen kept up as well. The two remained vigilant around them. Just as they crossed the bridge, gunshots rang out. They hurried to find cover, and at that moment, bombers tore through the night sky. Three bombers flew towards the direction of the small town.
1:24:9|1:24:13|The bombers flew in perfect formation, showcasing exceptional piloting skills.
1:24:13|1:24:39|Mu Liangfeng hid behind the wall, looking towards the other end of the alley. The alley was quiet, and a small cart slowly emerged. Bound on the cart were the mother and child who should have been fleeing, but unexpectedly appeared here. With a gunshot, the mother fell, and the child called out for her. Mu Liangfeng in the corner was burning with anger. Meanwhile, Xiao Wen looked outside through the gap in the bamboo shed, waiting for an opportunity. At that moment, another cart was pushed out.
1:24:48|1:24:53|Just as Xiao Wu was about to rush out to rescue someone, he was forced back by bullets, and he struggled to look towards [Mu Liangfeng].
1:24:54|1:25:7|At the entrance of the alley, Zhengye's attendant walked out slowly with a gun against [Liu Yan]'s head. Zhengye aimed his gun at [Er Wa]. Unable to bear it any longer, [Mu Liangfeng] walked out, pointing his gun at Zhengye. His injured right hand couldn't help but tremble.
1:25:12|1:25:18|[Mu Liangfeng] recalled the first time he carried out a mission, sitting in the military vehicle and looking at Zheng Ye.
1:25:37|1:25:53|Mu Liangfeng told Lieutenant Colonel lightly that Miss Hamada had been kidnapped. The Lieutenant Colonel was first surprised, then his eyes widened in anger. He shouted angrily towards the other end of the alley. Lightly pushed Liu Yan, Mu Liangfeng did as he said and shot towards Er Wa.
1:25:59|1:26:13|At this moment, the platoon leader caught up, intending to abduct Miss Hamada. Lieutenant Shao glared fiercely, while Mu Liangfeng's situation was also not optimistic, blood seeping through the gauze, dripping down.
1:26:15|1:26:37|Walking forward with [Liu Yan], who was extremely nervous, she breathed out slightly and moved forward cautiously, as if walking on thin ice. The platoon leader slowly released Miss Bin Tian and pointed a gun at the back of her head, instructing her to move forward slowly. Meanwhile, [Mu Liangfeng], who was holding the gun, had sweat dripping down his chin, showing no signs of relaxing his vigilance. The platoon leader seemed to see an opportunity in his heart, but [Mu Liangfeng] was unaware that he was already deeply in danger.
1:26:37|1:26:59|A sniper on the high wall has locked onto his head, while the platoon leader in the alley has been holding a gun against Bin Tian's head. The two of them walked towards the direction of the lieutenant together, but another sniper rifle also locked onto the platoon leader. The platoon leader stopped in his tracks, just reaching the middle of the alley. As they passed each other, in the shadows, the sniper's target switched to [Liu Yan].
1:26:59|1:27:12|The two hostages walked in opposite directions, the tension reaching its peak. Miss Hamada looked at the unfamiliar Captain Masaki, who slowly lowered his gun and called out Hamada's name. At that moment, a strange sound seemed to come from the sky.
1:27:12|1:27:44|First Miss Hamada, then [Mu Liangfeng], followed by everyone looking up involuntarily. Even the sniper upstairs noticed. The bombers are coming. Three bombers are flying towards the town. [Mu Liangfeng] rushes out, embraces [Liu Yan], and retreats. The awakened Lieutenant immediately fires, and Xiao Wu throws himself in front to block the bullets. Xiao Wu falls to the ground with a sound. The bombers start to dive, and the bombs that fall on the street destroy everything.
1:27:44|1:27:53|The impact also knocked down Mu Liangfeng. At this moment, a bomb fell from the sky, the rotating bomb shattered the roof but did not explode, instead getting stuck on the roof.
1:27:53|1:27:57|The town of Fenglingdu was engulfed in chaos during the Japanese bombing.
1:27:57|1:28:9|In the small town, the pond and the arched bridge were all indiscriminately bombed, including the sniper on the roof who didn't have time to retreat, rolling down from the eaves one by one.
1:28:13|1:28:30|The bomb, like a sharp chisel, pierced the calm wind chimes, leaving them riddled with holes, everything vanishing in the fiery explosion. The teahouse of [Liu Yan] was no exception, as the string of shell wind chimes swayed in the blaze, singing a final elegy. Xiao Wu, hit by a bullet, couldn't withstand the baptism of gunfire.
1:28:54|1:29:22|Even at the end of his life, Xiao Wu still dreams of the ideal of teaching and literacy. The lieutenant, who crawled out of the fire, called out the name of his lover. Covered in soot and tattered clothes, he picked up his gun from the ground. His love for Bin Tian supported his actions. He stumbled through the chaotic alley, shouting and searching, with only the raging fire and crackling sounds accompanying him.
1:29:23|1:29:32|The sobbing child startled Captain Mu Liangfeng, who aimed his gun and roared, but ultimately spared the child.
1:29:33|1:29:40|The flames of war have left too many scars in this small town, as well as too many traumas in people's hearts.
1:29:40|1:30:3|[Mu Liangfeng] lay motionless on the ground, while on the side, [Liu Yan] also fell to the ground. The overturned cart's wheels squeaked as if telling a tale of misfortune with a hoarse voice. [Liu Yan] slowly opened her eyes, and after a while, she regained consciousness. Gasping for breath, she tried to get up, but she realized that the fallen cart was firmly pinning down her legs.
1:30:3|1:30:11|She reached out to push, but couldn't move an inch. She looked around anxiously and found Mu Liangfeng lying unconscious.
1:30:15|1:30:21|[Mu Liangfeng] suddenly woke up, sat up, his eyes pitch black, momentarily losing his vision.
1:30:39|1:30:50|[Liu Yan] grabbed [Mu Liangfeng]'s hand and touched the wheel, and the two of them overturned it together. [Mu Liangfeng] lay down, [Liu Yan] struggled to climb up, and Shao Zuo still refused to give up.
1:31:3|1:31:14|Captain Shaozi threw the sniper rifle aside and urgently called out. He helped Miss Bindian up from the ground, gently held her in his arms and shook her. With blood all over her face, she opened her eyes and answered with difficulty:
1:31:45|1:31:55|At that moment, Bin Tian lost all signs of life, it was already too late, Shao Zuo held her hand and froze, his beloved woman finally fell in his arms.
1:31:59|1:32:11|After saying that, [Mu Liangfeng] tightly embraced her, repeating that sentence. At this moment, the tough and fierce lieutenant slowly lifted his head, his eyes moist with tears. He looked up at the sky and opened his mouth.
1:32:11|1:32:30|In this moment, his inner world finally collapsed. Overwhelmed with grief, he let out a long howl to the sky. In his heart, he secretly vowed to take revenge on [Mu Liangfeng]. His lips no longer trembled, his eyes became fierce and sharp. He gritted his teeth fiercely, swearing to seek vengeance.
1:32:30|1:32:50|At the same time, the platoon leader who had regained consciousness pushed open the small car. He struggled to get up, his mind still unclear. The Japanese jeep had already started. He raised his hand and shot the driver twice, causing the jeep to head towards him. The platoon leader jumped onto the jeep, punched the Japanese soldier in the face, dragged him out of the car, and threw him to the ground, landing a heavy blow on his face.
1:32:51|1:32:59|The Japanese soldiers who were about to counterattack were thrown away with their necks clamped by their legs. Across the fence, the platoon leader tightly strangled his neck with the Japanese soldier's clothes.
1:32:59|1:33:9|The Japanese soldier, unable to breathe, struggled with all his strength, kicking his feet on the ground until he finally stopped breathing. The platoon leader was also exhausted.
1:33:11|1:33:26|Lying on the ground, panting heavily, while on the other side, [Mu Liangfeng] carried [Liu Yan] on his back, with [Liu Yan] acting as [Mu Liangfeng]'s eyes. When [Mu Liangfeng] heard a noise, he suddenly stopped and looked back.
1:33:29|1:33:36|The two of them sneaked into a household, [Mu Liangfeng] loaded the gun and handed it to [Liu Yan].
1:33:37|1:34:8|The footsteps of the Japanese army are getting closer, [Liu Yan] has no choice but to take the pistol. [Mu Liangfeng] instructs her, "The Japanese army is getting closer." [Liu Yan] nods in agreement. [Mu Liangfeng] advises, "Hold the gun tightly with both hands." Outside, the Japanese soldiers slowly raise their sniper rifles and shoot, hitting two shots and falling backwards.
1:34:10|1:34:21|[Mu Liangfeng] urged [Liu Yan] to run quickly. The brief sound of gunfire just now was enough to attract more surviving Japanese soldiers. However, just as they started running, [Mu Liangfeng] was already locked in the sights of a sniper.
1:34:21|1:34:30|It was Mu Liangfeng on the other side of the river, he was not in a hurry to take the lives of the two, so he turned the gun and broke the swaying electric pole.
1:34:38|1:34:54|The utility pole pulled down other lines, causing all the tiles to collapse and the roof to cave in. [Mu Liangfeng] was smashed into the water as a result. [Liu Yan] had her legs pinned under a pile of broken wood and tiles. She tried to move but to no avail, once again losing her ability to move. She suddenly realized that [Mu Liangfeng] had disappeared.
1:35:4|1:35:15|Facing the insane lieutenant, [Liu Yan] was very timid. In the small river, [Mu Liangfeng] peeked out, holding a gun and lying face up. He aimed at the lieutenant and pulled the trigger, only to find that the bullets had run out.
1:35:15|1:35:24|However, at this moment, he noticed that there was an unexploded bomb wedged in the house behind the lieutenant, but he didn't have a single bullet to detonate it.
1:35:24|1:35:29|Captain suddenly changed targets, aiming at [Liu Yan]. [Liu Yan] panicked, while the Captain, with a fierce expression, said:
1:36:0|1:36:38|The child handed a bullet to [Mu Liangfeng], which was the one that he accidentally dropped under the bed on his first night at the teahouse. It was picked up by this curious child and in the explosion, the house shattered, wood splinters flew in all directions, time seemed to slow down at that moment. [Liu Yan] breathed a sigh of relief, and [Mu Liangfeng] also exhausted all his strength, slowly falling down.
1:36:38|1:36:55|Liu Yan looked over, Mu Liangfeng insisted on turning his head to look at her, faint shouts came, Mu Liangfeng, with blurred vision, raised his gun, still wanting to protect Liu Yan. It was the platoon leader and the guerrilla team coming, and he fell down exhausted.
1:36:56|1:37:29|In Fenglingdu Town, the town that has been baptized by artillery no longer has its former appearance. At the graveside, [Liu Yan] steps forward to place a bouquet of flowers. The guerrilla team, with [Mu Liangfeng] and the platoon leader in attendance, mourns. With a command from the platoon leader, everyone stands solemnly in salute. At this moment, the sound of airplanes is heard, and everyone looks up. Two planes are seen flying in the distance. The guerrilla team leader draws his gun, ready for battle.
1:37:40|1:37:45|The plane did not drop bombs, but scattered newspapers like celestial flowers.
1:37:45|1:37:51|[Mu Liangfeng] reached out and grabbed a photo, taking a closer look. It showed him and [Liu Yan], with the caption: "My Chinese friend."
