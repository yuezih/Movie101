0:1:18|0:1:36|The woman lying on the ground slowly opened her eyes, but in her mind, scenes of falling into the water appeared hazily. She stared around with wide eyes, different fragments of memories constantly surfacing before her. The uncontrollable circuit wires made crackling sounds, and after a noisy commotion, a scream followed.
0:1:37|0:1:45|The woman's painful expression appears on the screen, and the blood on the ground evaporates quickly with the passage of time, gradually disappearing.
0:1:45|0:1:55|At this moment, a man's figure appeared in the woman's mind, but she couldn't see his face clearly, only to see him lying motionless on the ground, his chest rising and falling.
0:1:55|0:1:57|At this moment, the sound of footsteps could be heard in the distance.
0:1:58|0:2:2|A bald man in a white coat walks cautiously into the iron fence.
0:2:2|0:2:9|Outside, lightning flashed and thunder roared. [Ma Rui] shrank his head, looked around, and quickly opened the door to walk in.
0:2:9|0:2:11|The woman sat up in fear, continuously moving backwards.
0:2:11|0:2:14|He bent down and looked at the woman, getting closer step by step.
0:2:14|0:2:19|The woman stepped back and accidentally bumped into the man in a suit sitting behind her, [Li Zheng].
0:2:33|0:2:42|The man in a suit [Li Zheng] looked around and his expression became anxious.
0:2:42|0:2:46|The man in a suit [Li Zheng] frantically searched his pockets, but what he pulled out was a seal.
0:2:46|0:2:50|Suddenly, a pair of glasses was thrown not far away, and the sound of an argument could be heard in the aisle.
0:2:53|0:3:5|The bald man pushed open the door, stuck his head out to check the situation, only to see a figure flying out directly from the corridor and crashing heavily to the ground.
0:3:5|0:3:12|The old man on the ground propped up his upper body, angrily accusing, the leather-jacketed man who followed him glanced at him, then turned to look at the two people cowering at the door.
0:3:33|0:3:41|After the group quieted down, they heard a faint sound of pain coming from not far away. Everyone looked in the direction of the sound, but couldn't see anyone there.
0:3:52|0:4:11|The woman heard a sound, and everyone inside was so scared that they didn't move. Outside, the lightning kept flashing, making the pitch-black room alternately bright and dark. Except for the woman hiding in the corner, everyone else crouched down and slowly walked towards the direction where the sound was coming from. The man in the leather jacket was holding a fire extinguisher and walking at the front, with the rest of the people following behind.
0:4:11|0:4:24|The woman didn't know when she followed behind them, slowly walking forward while leaning against the wall. The sound of the movie became clearer and clearer, and at the end of the corridor by the stairs, a woman with messy long hair was crawling up.
0:4:24|0:4:28|The crowd took a few steps back upon seeing this scene.
0:4:32|0:4:37|The woman with long hair stood up, raised her hand to tidy her hair, and looked at them fearfully.
0:4:37|0:4:40|Everyone breathed a sigh of relief when [An Xi] spoke.
0:4:40|0:4:42|The man in the leather jacket also put down the fire extinguisher.
0:4:42|0:4:46|The woman with long hair lowered her head and pulled up the bathrobe that was slipping off her shoulders.
0:4:46|0:4:49|Later, everyone slowly walked down the stairs.
0:4:49|0:4:53|The man in the leather jacket walked behind and raised the fire extinguisher beside him again.
0:4:53|0:4:56|He walked while looking around at the surroundings.
0:4:56|0:5:0|The bald man supported his waist with his hands, arched his back, trying hard to see things around him clearly.
0:5:0|0:5:4|In the flickering of electric light, a heavy iron door appeared before everyone's eyes.
0:5:4|0:5:8|Everyone stood in place, looking at the iron gate that pierced straight through the ceiling.
0:5:8|0:5:12|At this moment, [Ma Rui] suddenly dropped the fire extinguisher in his hand and ran over.
0:5:12|0:5:13|The man in a suit is strong and runs over as well.
0:5:14|0:5:31|The two pulled the door handle tightly and pulled hard, while the bald man pounded the iron door with his fist. Hearing the shouts, everyone turned to look, only to see the back of a host appearing upstairs, and the people below all raised their heads, looking at this mysterious figure. The man in the leather jacket couldn't help but ask,
0:5:31|0:5:38|The man with a cane arrived at the corner of the stairs, he glanced at the people below without answering. The man in the leather jacket asked again,
0:5:45|0:5:57|Upon hearing this, the man in the leather jacket quickly ran up and stood in front of the man.
0:5:57|0:6:5|After speaking, he pushed aside the man in front of him and ran up, eagerly trying to find a way out, but almost stepped into the void as a result.
0:6:12|0:6:20|The man in the leather jacket gradually calmed down and turned around, pointing behind him.
0:6:20|0:6:30|At this moment, a bright light suddenly appeared on the camera on the wall.
0:6:30|0:6:33|After the woman with long hair finished speaking, everyone looked around warily.
0:6:49|0:6:51|Upon hearing the man's words, [An Xi]...
0:6:51|0:6:56|Everyone fell silent, standing together and looking at each other, unsure of what to do next.
0:6:56|0:7:1|At this moment, a crisp click of a switch broke the tranquility.
0:7:1|0:7:10|The dark house suddenly lit up, everyone puzzled, looking up at the strange structure around them, then all turned to look at the woman standing in front of the switch.
0:7:11|0:7:28|Soon, everyone was quickly drawn to a brightly lit room. With his hands in his pockets, [Ma Rui] glanced through the door and accidentally stumbled as he stepped over the threshold. The old man behind him was startled by this action and stood still for a moment, only to see [Ma Rui] walk inside.
0:7:28|0:7:33|An Xi kept flipping through the things on the table, while others also walked in one after another, paying attention to everything around them.
0:7:34|0:7:45|The old man looked at the dusty book on the table in confusion, while the supervisor man hurried to the TV on the other side. The long-haired woman who had just entered the room was attracted by the clothes in the wardrobe beside her.
0:7:45|0:7:56|Just as she was about to take off her clothes, [Li Zheng] raised his hand to stop her.
0:7:56|0:7:57|[Li Zheng] opens his clothes.
0:8:3|0:8:6|Everyone listened with fearful expressions.
0:8:11|0:8:19|The woman with long hair widened her eyes, looking around uneasily, a chill seeping from the depths of her heart, she involuntarily hugged her thin bathrobe tightly.
0:8:19|0:8:24|The man, seeing the situation, took off his coat and walked over to cover her with it, limping along with a fist.
0:8:35|0:8:40|At this moment, the man in the frame is holding a camera, filming an accident scene.
0:8:40|0:8:46|In the scene, firefighters and police officers are also busy working non-stop.
0:8:46|0:8:52|The old man then began to speak.
0:8:52|0:8:55|At this moment, [Xiao Nai'en] walked into the classroom with a book.
0:8:58|0:9:4|The noise was incessant, and [Xiao Nan] slammed the textbook hard, only to be choked by the dust of the powder that was supposed to be remembered.
0:9:4|0:9:8|After speaking, [Li Zheng] looked at the man in the suit behind him.
0:9:8|0:9:11|At this moment, a group of reporters surrounded [Ma Rui].
0:9:23|0:9:29|The bald man continued, saying.
0:9:29|0:9:39|Entering the operating room, [Han Mushan] corrected when he heard it, [Ma Rui] pointed to the long-haired woman standing beside him.
0:9:59|0:10:8|In the scene, a man is hugging [Lily] from behind, and they are hurriedly taking off their clothes and lying on the bed.
0:10:8|0:10:25|After [Lily] finished speaking, [Xiao Nan] let out a meaningful howl, and the others didn't say anything. They turned to look at the man in the leather jacket sitting on the chair. The leather jacket man, who hadn't reacted yet, looked down at the ground. Perhaps sensing the gaze above him, he lifted his eyelids and glanced around, only to find everyone looking at him.
0:10:25|0:10:27|A reluctant expression appeared on the face.
0:10:27|0:10:39|In the scene, the man in a leather jacket is sitting in the car, tapping the steering wheel.
0:10:45|0:10:46|Han Mushan then asked a question.
0:11:19|0:11:31|[Ma Rui] walked out of the courtroom with a smile, but the next moment he felt like he couldn't breathe. His face turned pale as he gasped for air, leaning against a nearby pillar. Meanwhile, [Lily], who had just finished the sauna, was drying her hair with a towel.
0:11:31|0:11:35|[Li Zheng] quietly jumped off the car with a camera in hand, ready to leave.
0:11:40|0:11:44|Students were making a lot of noise in the classroom, making [Xiao Nai'en] so angry that he slammed the blackboard.
0:11:48|0:11:56|[Han Mushan] had just finished speaking when the elevator started making unusual noises. Meanwhile, [Yang Meng], who was driving at the time, accidentally left his phone hanging in the front passenger seat.
0:11:56|0:11:59|He stared at the road ahead, bent down to pick up his phone.
0:11:59|0:12:6|[Lily] put on a bathrobe and planned to go out, but found that she couldn't push the door open. She anxiously knocked on the glass door of the bathroom.
0:12:6|0:12:12|Outside the courtroom, [Ma Rui] took out the antidote to save himself, but eventually collapsed on the ground.
0:12:17|0:12:26|[Lee Zheng], who was discovered by the police, heard a shout from behind while fleeing. He raised the camera again to capture the news in front of him, and the explosion happened in an instant.
0:12:28|0:12:36|The elevator in the hospital is rapidly falling, [Han Mushan] screams in terror, while [Lily] in the bathroom can't hold on and slips to the ground.
0:12:36|0:12:46|At this moment, [Yang Meng], who had just picked up his phone, crashed into the entire car, causing the glass of the windshield to splinter in all directions, and his head slammed into the deployed airbag.
0:12:46|0:12:50|After finishing her story, everyone looked silently at An Xi.
0:13:9|0:13:13|[Han Mushan] stepped forward to break up the fight, while [Lily] quietly walked to [An Xi]'s side to comfort him.
0:13:33|0:13:40|After bringing the sun out, everyone carried the paint bucket and placed it against the wall.
0:13:40|0:13:51|The men hoisted [Lily] onto a paint bucket, and soon she saw outside through the window. Outside the window, [Lily] gazed into the distance, while [An Xi] stood at the room door watching them from afar.
0:13:51|0:14:10|Shortly after, [Lily] climbed down from the paint bucket. [Xiao Nai'en] asked anxiously. Upon hearing [Lily]'s words, the people around her were so scared that they took a step back. [Lily], unable to stop shivering, silently walked forward.
0:14:10|0:14:12|Han Mushan couldn't believe it and caught up to ask a question.
0:14:39|0:14:50|[Yang Meng] cursed, then turned and climbed onto the paint bucket. He firmly pressed down on the chair that was swaying at the top, struggling to dig at the window, trying to get a clear view of this ghostly place that trapped him.
0:14:50|0:14:59|Outside, the rain had started to drizzle, but the sign at the door of the Qingshan Mental Health Rehabilitation Center was particularly clear.
0:14:59|0:15:8|At this moment, the screen is shrouded in the deep sea, with [An Xi] closing her eyes slowly sinking to the bottom of the sea, but there is a voice beside her waking her up.
0:15:53|0:15:55|Yao Meng was speechless after being criticized.
0:15:55|0:16:0|Han Mushan walked out with a dark expression, took off his white coat, and threw it aside.
0:16:0|0:16:5|At this moment, the small window on the door opened and someone put in a lunch box, then immediately closed it.
0:16:11|0:16:16|Everyone was vigorously banging on the window and shouting for help, but outside it was eerily silent.
0:16:16|0:16:22|At this moment, [Xiao Nai'en] picked up the lunch box and turned around, with everyone around him gathering together.
0:16:22|0:16:25|The others remained silent, watching the strange lunchbox in silence.
0:16:25|0:16:30|[Xiao Nai'en] looked up and gazed at [Li Zheng] standing not far away, his eyes filled with confusion.
0:16:30|0:16:38|Following that, everyone gathered in the room. Han Mushan set aside the medicine on top of the lunchbox, gently lifted the lid, revealing a box lunch that was nothing out of the ordinary.
0:17:9|0:17:14|[Xiao Nai'en] had just handed out the boxed meal, but [Li Zheng] snatched it from the middle and dumped the meal directly on the ground.
0:17:14|0:17:16|[Ma Rui] angrily pushed the chair away and stood up.
0:17:25|0:17:29|Li Zheng, who was pushed hard, staggered back a few steps with a cough.
0:17:29|0:17:34|Seeing the furious [Yang Meng], he walked up with crutches and stared into [Yang Meng]'s eyes.
0:17:38|0:17:44|He then turned around and looked at the crowd behind him.
0:18:37|0:18:45|[Xiao Nai'en] then took a screw and drew a line on the wall.
0:19:19|0:19:24|[Han Mushan] had just finished speaking when suddenly music could be heard from outside, leaving everyone in the room looking puzzled.
0:19:32|0:19:40|[Li Zheng] took the lead to go out, the other men followed behind, [Lily] also wanted to go out, but [An Xi] stood up to stop her, she comforted [An Xi] and followed them out.
0:20:22|0:20:27|[An Xi], hiding under the table, grabbed the connecting wire near her feet and pulled the phone towards her to answer it.
0:20:35|0:20:38|[An Xi] held the phone in her hand, but her body kept twitching.
0:20:38|0:20:44|She was breathing heavily, her eyes fixed on the silent door outside, her disheveled hair covering half of An Xi's face.
0:20:44|0:20:53|The scene then cuts to [An Xi] being bound to a chair, with a machine operating beside her. She opens her mouth in terror, trying to scream, but no sound comes out.
0:20:53|0:21:2|At this moment, [Li Zheng] sitting in the electric chair gradually regained consciousness. He glanced at the doctor sitting in front of him, then lowered his head to look at his hands that were locked, and couldn't help but struggle.
0:21:20|0:21:24|The doctor frowned at him, and [Li Zheng] didn't know how to refute.
0:22:4|0:22:6|The scene returns to the game.
0:22:38|0:22:47|After speaking, [Yang Meng] smiled helplessly, and the doctor also smiled at him.
0:22:47|0:22:52|After speaking, [Li Zheng] reached out his hand to [Lily] beside him, and Lily reached out her hand as well, the two gazed deeply into each other's eyes.
0:23:1|0:23:4|At this moment, [Han Mushan] and [Xiao Nai'en] stood still in place, looking lost.
0:23:4|0:23:14|[Li Zheng] coughed, stood with his hands on his hips watching them, [Han Mushan] had to slowly approach [Xiao Nai'en], who raised his hand in confusion and then gently patted Xiao Nai'en's shoulder.
0:23:14|0:23:20|On the other side, although [Xiao Nai'en] looked pained, one hand was already placed on [Han Mushan]'s waist.
0:23:20|0:23:25|[Li Zheng] lowered his head and said, and at this moment, the scene cut back to the treatment room.
0:23:47|0:23:50|Soon after, several of them struck poses representing the evolution of humans.
0:24:4|0:24:11|After the young man finished speaking, he slowly extended his middle finger. The doctor immediately pressed the defibrillator button, and the sound of the electric current crackled. The people in the chairs groaned in pain.
0:24:16|0:24:27|Accompanied by a burst of sweet and tough shouting from Yang Meng, the scene gradually shows An Xi's empty and lifeless eyes. He sits straight on the stairs, his eyelids trembling slightly, looking helplessly ahead.
0:24:27|0:24:41|At this moment, the shocked crowd returned to their original spot. The others were all sitting listlessly, resting. [Ma Rui] bent over, coughing heavily.
0:24:41|0:24:45|At this moment, [Han Mushan] walked towards [An Xi], then leaned against the stairs and squatted in front of him.
0:25:7|0:25:15|Everyone looked up in confusion after hearing that, and [Ma Rui], who was sitting on the ground, stood up directly. [Li Zheng] asked.
0:25:15|0:25:18|[An Xi], with a pale face, turned to look at everyone.
0:25:23|0:25:28|[An Xi] recalled the scene in the treatment room.
0:25:28|0:25:42|An Xi, locked in the chair, looked at the doctor sitting opposite under the light, crying softly in fear. He frowned, moving his legs back and forth continuously.
0:25:48|0:25:58|After speaking, the doctor unlocked the handcuffs restraining [An Xi]'s hands. She slowly lifted her head and picked up the medicine placed in the iron basin.
0:25:58|0:26:6|After taking the medicine, [Yang Meng] heard this and immediately stood up.
0:26:10|0:26:14|[Li Zheng] leaned on the railing with one hand and stood up with a cane in the other.
0:26:19|0:26:26|He slowly approached.
0:26:35|0:26:44|Bending down, [Ma Rui] stared at An Xi with a certain demeanor.
0:26:44|0:26:46|[Li Zheng] gritted his teeth and forcefully slapped [An Xi]'s shoulder.
0:27:44|0:28:4|After speaking, he looked at [An Xi], raised his hand and pointed to the iron fence at the end of the corridor. [An Xi], with tears in her eyes, supported herself on the stairs and stood up, looking at the furious [Li Zheng]. [Xiao Nai'en] stood aside with a troubled expression, while [Han Mushan] turned to look at the others. The dim light seeped through the cracks and cast a hint of sadness on the wall.
0:28:4|0:28:6|The dimly lit corridor still had lights on both sides.
0:28:6|0:28:17|At this moment, [An Xi]'s bright and straight back appeared in the corridor. He locked himself in the iron fence without looking back, and everyone stood still silently watching him walk in.
0:28:18|0:28:24|Not long after, the sky suddenly thundered loudly, and the mental hospital was once again shrouded in dark clouds.
0:28:24|0:28:28|[An Xi], who is in prison, squats by the wall, constantly writing and drawing on it.
0:28:28|0:28:34|Slowly, [An Xi]'s figure, who was half squatting, gradually stood up, but the stone in her hand accidentally fell.
0:28:34|0:28:40|She bent down to pick it up, then immediately started writing on the wall, with a constant muttering sound coming from her mouth.
0:28:42|0:28:48|At this moment, the scene shows the back of [Xiao Nai'en], holding a nail and drawing another line on the cement wall.
0:28:48|0:28:55|Sitting upright, [Ma Rui] rested his elbows on the table and stared blankly, while [Yang Meng] propped his feet up on the table, looking at the painting on his lap.
0:28:55|0:29:0|Lily tilted her head listlessly and stared ahead, while Han Mushan sat on the other side with a furrowed brow.
0:29:0|0:29:4|At this moment, [Yang Meng] threw the painting off his leg, and [Li Zheng] turned to look at him.
0:29:18|0:29:21|[Yang Meng] crossed his hands and stared at the ceiling without saying a word.
0:31:8|0:31:11|Seeing everyone starting to sing along, [Ma Rui] didn't say anything more.
0:31:11|0:31:20|[Li Zheng] looked up, glanced at the camera, and then pointed. Everyone immediately understood his meaning, walked towards the area visible to the camera, and started singing loudly again.
0:31:21|0:31:54|Who is calling out for deep love, letting my desires drift like white clouds. Teacher Xiao, what are you doing? Old man, what song are you singing? Come on, let me keep the beat for you. Just that line, ready, go. Who is calling out. Everyone obediently started singing, but [Li Zheng] walked over, knocked over a chair on the side, and everyone's singing abruptly stopped.
0:32:19|0:32:24|The words were not finished yet when the camera started to rotate.
0:32:24|0:32:26|Everyone looked straight at the camera.
0:32:34|0:32:42|Li Zheng sang while gesturing with his arms, encouraging everyone to speak louder. Then he picked up his cane and glanced at [Xiao Nai'en] standing in front.
0:32:42|0:32:50|Reluctant [Xiao Nai'en] nodded heavily, his mouth moving along. The others, as if shouting their hearts out, looked at the camera and sang with all their might.
0:34:1|0:34:6|[Lily] sings an Indian song from a different angle, with a few people following behind humming the melody.
0:34:6|0:34:12|Everyone stood in front of the camera, with all of them standing behind [Lily], raising their hands to perform the Guanyin hand-holding gesture.
0:34:12|0:34:19|Following that, everyone started dancing in circles around the staircase, and the camera in the corner of the room rotated along with their formation.
0:34:22|0:34:26|An Xi, who was locked in prison, heard the commotion outside and turned to look at them.
0:34:26|0:34:34|At this moment, [Lily] stood at the front of the line, twisting her body and swinging her arms, while the men behind her clumsily danced, their movements looking very comical.
0:34:42|0:34:48|After a few spins, everyone's movements became more chaotic, but the camera still followed the formation as it spun.
0:34:48|0:34:54|[Ma Rui] was exhausted and stopped, leaving the group. [Li Zheng] grabbed him.
0:34:54|0:34:59|[Ma Rui] shook off [Li Zheng]'s hand, unwilling to say more, and [Li Zheng] turned to call on others.
0:35:4|0:35:9|Forget it, [Li Zheng] scratched his head and walked towards [Ma Rui].
0:35:40|0:35:43|At this moment, [Li Zheng] suddenly grabbed [Ma Rui]'s hand.
0:35:43|0:35:47|[Yang Meng] stood up immediately when he heard there was going to be a fight, and [Li Zheng] smiled and said.
0:36:7|0:36:20|[Ma Rui] advances with cautious steps, while [Han Mushan] keeps retreating.
0:36:20|0:36:24|[Xiao Nai'en] quickly waved his hand, and [Li Zheng] walked over and said.
0:36:35|0:36:38|At this moment, [Lily] rushed over and grabbed [Xiao Nai'en]'s hand, placing it on her chest.
0:36:57|0:37:12|[Han Mushan] pretended to lightly punch [Xiao Nai'en], who then mustered up the courage to push [Han Mushan] back. The two of them started playfully exchanging punches, while [Yang Meng] on the side couldn't bear to watch.
0:37:12|0:37:18|[Ma Rui], with his hands in his pockets, immediately reacted and strode over aggressively, rolling up his sleeves and pushing [Xiao Nai'en] forcefully.
0:37:38|0:37:40|Hearing the noise, [An Xi] turned to look at them.
0:37:59|0:38:5|At this moment, the camera suddenly flashed, but [Li Zheng] was looking at the crowd pretending to be fighting.
0:38:5|0:38:9|Seeing everyone's poor acting, [Li Zheng]'s eyes suddenly became fierce.
0:38:12|0:38:17|He walked over and angrily threw away his cane.
0:38:17|0:38:30|The camera started operating again, with [Li Zheng] reaching through the railing to grab [Xiao Nai'en].
0:38:30|0:38:32|[Xiao Nai'en] gasped for breath, struggling hard.
0:38:34|0:38:38|Panicked, [Ma Rui] hurriedly propped up [Xiao Nai'en]'s arm.
0:38:38|0:38:46|[Yang Meng] saw [Xiao Nai'en] struggling non-stop, and quickly jumped down from the paint bucket. Beside him, [Lily] was so scared that she covered her mouth with her hand.
0:38:46|0:38:53|[An Xi] saw this scene and immediately opened the gate to run out, controlling the three people with a fierce look in their eyes.
0:38:53|0:39:0|[Xiao Nai'en], who was being choked, widened his eyes and uncontrollably sprayed saliva, [An Xi] rushed over and shouted.
0:39:0|0:39:1|He immediately ran down the stairs and caught [Li Zheng].
0:39:4|0:39:8|[Yang Meng] also rushed over and pulled [Li Zheng] up with force.
0:39:11|0:39:17|Ma Rui and [Han Mushan] were both so scared when they saw it that they immediately stepped back.
0:39:17|0:39:18|[Li Zheng] lay on the ground, looking puzzled.
0:39:26|0:39:37|Seeing [Yang Meng] angrily, [Li Zheng] stood up from the ground, and Xiao Nan, who survived the ordeal, suddenly realized and cried in fear. However, [Li Zheng] still looked puzzled.
0:39:37|0:39:50|At this moment, [Yang Meng] stared straight at [Li Zheng] as he walked over, sizing him up. Then he raised his hand and pointed behind [Li Zheng]. [Li Zheng] followed his direction and turned his head, only to see the slightly eerie prison at the end of the corridor.
0:39:50|0:39:52|[Li Zheng] looked back at [Yang Meng].
0:40:6|0:40:12|[Li Zheng] stared at him incredulously, while Yao Meng also took a few steps back and stood beside the others.
0:40:12|0:40:18|At this moment, everyone looked at [Li Zheng], even the usually gentle [An Xi] stared at him intently.
0:40:18|0:40:31|Seeing everyone's indifferent eyes, [Li Zheng] didn't say anything more. Soon, a new figure appeared in the prison. [Li Zheng] was seen supporting himself with a crutch, his upper body leaning forward, his gaze fierce as he looked towards the other end of the corridor.
0:40:31|0:40:35|In the midst of lightning and thunder, [Li Zheng]'s eyes suddenly caught sight of the words on the wall.
0:40:35|0:40:40|He fixed his gaze and saw that almost the entire wall was covered with the words "only me".
0:40:40|0:40:46|The next day, the hospital staff opened the window as usual, placed a bowl of boxed meal inside, and quickly closed it.
0:40:46|0:40:58|[Yang Meng] walked over, picked up the bowl of boxed lunch, while the other men stood in place watching him, only to see him happily walking away with the food.
0:41:29|0:41:38|[Yang Meng] handed over the medicine, while [Ma Rui] smiled kindly and shook his head, afraid of angering [Yang Meng]. Then he looked at [Han Mushan], only to see him turn his head away, with a blue expression on his face.
0:41:51|0:41:57|In the middle of the conversation, he handed the lunchbox to [Xiao Nai'en], then picked up the medicine and headed straight to the prison.
0:41:57|0:42:2|Passing by the staircase, he stopped in his tracks and glanced at [Lily] standing next to him.
0:42:5|0:42:9|[Yang Meng] smiled triumphantly, holding the medicine as he walked back to the prison.
0:42:9|0:42:12|[An Xi] stood up uneasily, craning her neck to look around.
0:42:12|0:42:15|Everyone looked towards the direction of the prison with confusion.
0:42:15|0:42:17|[An Xi] saw [Yang Meng] open the door and walk in.
0:42:33|0:42:37|Others were so scared by the commotion that they didn't dare to say a word.
0:42:37|0:42:41|[Lily] carefully took off the coat that [Li Zheng] had given her at that time.
0:42:41|0:42:45|Not long after, [Yang Meng] strode out aggressively with a cane.
0:42:45|0:42:51|He swaggered through the corridor, standing at the top of the stairs, his cane leaving a pool of blood.
0:42:51|0:42:54|[Yang Meng] didn't care at all and threw the crutch aside.
0:42:55|0:43:5|[Ma Rui] saw him and smiled kindly, then [Yang Meng] turned to look at the stairs, [Lily] was lowering her head, tightly wrapped in a thin bathrobe, he immediately took off his coat and threw it to [Lily].
0:43:5|0:43:10|Looking at the pitiful look in Lily's eyes, the smugness in Yang Meng's eyes became even more apparent.
0:43:10|0:43:15|In the afternoon, everyone found a piece of iron plate and placed it between the broken stairs. [Yang Meng] was the first to step on it.
0:43:17|0:43:22|After hearing Lily's concern, Yang Meng turned his head and smiled, then ran over with determination.
0:43:22|0:43:27|The hopeful iron gate is within reach, with others showing anticipation in their eyes.
0:43:27|0:43:31|[Yang Meng] slowly moved the door handle, and the iron gate made a unlocking sound.
0:43:31|0:43:35|He smiled and glanced at Lily, then pushed gently, but the door didn't open.
0:43:35|0:43:39|[Yang Meng]'s face suddenly changed, he pushed harder, but the door still didn't budge.
0:43:42|0:43:47|Emotionally out of control, [Yang Meng] kept kicking the iron door, and the others dared not approach.
0:43:47|0:43:51|Until [Yang Meng] gradually calmed down, [Ma Rui] dared to walk over and try.
0:43:51|0:43:55|He moved the handle and gently pulled it inwards, and the iron gate slowly opened.
0:43:57|0:44:7|[Yang Meng] tilted his head and looked through the crack in the door, with others also peeking out from behind. The closest to the door, [Ma Rui], squinted his eyes against the bright light outside.
0:44:7|0:44:12|Yang Meng was the first to walk out of the door, staring wide-eyed at everything around him.
0:44:12|0:44:25|Following closely behind, [Ma Rui] glanced to both sides, immediately leaned against the balcony and looked down. The raindrops the size of soybeans kept hitting his face from the sky. After the others looked around, the confusion on their faces also turned into shock.
0:44:26|0:44:31|With the rotation of the camera, the shocking scenery gradually unfolds, leaving everyone in awe.
0:44:31|0:44:35|In the distance, the mountain peaks stretch endlessly, as if there is no end in sight.
0:44:35|0:44:40|The mist surged from the hidden valley, drifting to the mountaintop, resembling a green hat.
0:44:40|0:44:44|The mental hospital was surrounded on all sides, making it appear even smaller.
0:44:44|0:44:46|At night, the sound of Lily's laughter could be heard coming from the bathroom.
0:44:52|0:45:1|Standing outside the door, [An Xi] had a cold expression, staring intently at the closed bathroom door. Her eyes gradually became desolate, and suddenly, she picked up a small bucket next to her and placed it under the faucet.
0:45:13|0:45:17|[An Xi] threw away the bucket and ran out, pushing open the door to the bathroom.
0:45:17|0:45:26|[Yang Meng] angrily straightened his clothes and saw the panicked figure of [An Xi], everyone crowded around.
0:45:26|0:45:38|Everyone turned their heads at the sound, only to see [Yang Meng] walking out with [Lily], his arm around her shoulder, still carrying the bucket in his hand. Finally, he threw it on the ground with a flick of his hand.
0:45:53|0:46:0|Under the pressure from Yang, no one dared to stop him, and he walked straight towards [An Xi] standing on the side.
0:46:0|0:46:4|[An Xi], hiding behind a pillar, turned around to meet his fierce gaze.
0:46:4|0:46:8|Yang stared at [An Xi] without saying a word, and the atmosphere dropped to its lowest point at that moment.
0:46:11|0:46:13|Yang Meng looked at [An Xi] and asked again.
0:46:50|0:46:57|After speaking, [Yang Meng] took [Lily]'s hand and headed towards the second floor, but [Han Mushan] followed and called out to him.
0:46:57|0:47:1|[Yang Meng] turned around and glared at him, [Han Mushan] had to leave.
0:47:19|0:47:24|[Yang Meng] turned around in surprise, glanced at [Han Mushan], and then waved at him.
0:47:24|0:47:28|As [Han Mushan] approached, he leaned down and asked in a low voice.
0:48:36|0:48:42|[Yang Meng]'s smile disappeared instantly as he tightly grabbed [Lily].
0:48:42|0:48:45|Lily didn't answer, and laughed like a crazy person.
0:49:0|0:49:5|The angered [Yang Meng] turned around and gave [Han Mushan] a kick, causing him to step back repeatedly and fall to the ground.
0:49:5|0:49:10|[Yang Meng] walked over and stepped on his hand.
0:49:17|0:49:21|[Xiao Nai'en] couldn't stand it, grabbed [Yang Meng]'s hair from behind.
0:49:21|0:49:36|Yang Meng gritted his teeth in pain, but he grabbed his finger and bent it backwards, causing [Xiao Nai'en] to scream in agony.
0:49:36|0:49:39|[Xiao Nai'en] grimaced in pain, and [An Xi] immediately grabbed Yang Meng's hand.
0:49:49|0:49:53|Upon hearing this, [Yang Meng] pushed [An Xi] away.
0:50:4|0:50:8|Yang Meng shouted desperately, tearing at his bathrobe with both hands.
0:50:8|0:50:12|At this moment, a chair came down on the back of his head.
0:50:12|0:50:21|Soon, Yang Meng fainted on the side, while [Li Zheng] limped up the stairs and then threw the broken chair aside.
0:50:21|0:50:24|In the blink of an eye, Yang Meng was already lying in prison.
0:50:24|0:50:27|[Ma Rui] quickly closed the iron gate and put a lock on it.
0:50:27|0:50:31|Yang Meng heard a noise and groggily looked around.
0:50:35|0:50:39|The moment the lock was pressed, [Xiao Nai'en] immediately began to preach.
0:51:3|0:51:5|Yang Meng, sitting on the ground, suddenly lunged forward with all his strength.
0:51:5|0:51:13|He clung to the fence gate, glaring fiercely at [Ma Rui] standing on the other side, but a moment of dizziness made him involuntarily close his eyes.
0:51:13|0:51:17|[Han Mushan], standing not far away, ran over to urge them on and then immediately walked away.
0:51:17|0:51:22|[Xiao Nai'en] also spat behind him, then quickly retreated.
0:51:22|0:51:27|[An Xi] saw [Yang Meng] squinting silently, while [Ma Rui] tentatively leaned forward.
0:51:29|0:51:47|Yang Meng, enraged, is sprawled on the fence, trying to grab Ma Rui.
0:51:47|0:51:50|Seeing the crazed look of [Yang Meng], everyone hurriedly left.
0:51:50|0:51:53|[Yang Meng] looked at their fearful expressions and burst into maniacal laughter.
0:52:2|0:52:11|At this moment, [An Xi] is kneeling on the ground praying, while inside the prison, [Yang Meng] is angrily grabbing the iron bars and shaking them constantly, roaring in anger.
0:52:11|0:52:17|The shadow of the wall fan is reflected on the floor, making [An Xi]'s slender figure appear even smaller.
0:52:17|0:52:22|A bolt of lightning struck, illuminating the prison and making the Jesus statue on the wall stand out.
0:53:46|0:53:54|Seeing [Xiao Nai'en] bowing and apologizing, [Li Zheng] stood up in a panic.
0:53:54|0:53:59|[Ma Rui] looked up at [Li Zheng] and gave a embarrassed smile.
0:53:59|0:54:3|Standing across from [Li Zheng], he looked a bit embarrassed as he reached out his hand.
0:54:9|0:54:25|After speaking, [Han Mushan] walked towards the wardrobe with a smile and took out the hospital gown in front of everyone.
0:54:37|0:54:44|[Xiao Nai'en] took off the gauze on her head and threw it on the table.
0:54:44|0:54:46|Suddenly, the glass door was pushed open.
0:54:46|0:54:51|[Lily] turned around and saw the menacing [Yang Meng], and immediately ran to the other side in fear.
0:54:51|0:54:53|[Li Zheng] picked up his cane and stood up, glaring at her.
0:54:53|0:54:56|On the side, [Xiao Nai'en] felt weak in the legs and took a few steps back.
0:54:57|0:55:1|At this moment, [Yang Meng] unexpectedly bent down and bowed to everyone.
0:55:1|0:55:5|Others looked at each other in confusion, their faces showing bewilderment.
0:55:5|0:55:8|He then sat up and removed the cervical collar.
0:55:25|0:55:32|He threw the broken lock heavily onto the table, at this moment, the surveillance camera in the corner was silently watching everything.
0:55:32|0:55:42|Soon, everyone put on their gowns and posted the written big-character posters on the pillars. Accompanied by a round of enthusiastic applause, "Happy Healing, Early Recovery" appeared in front of them in eight big characters.
0:55:42|0:55:44|[Ma Rui] clapped his hands, exclaiming excitedly.
0:56:2|0:56:6|Seeing the change in the expressions of the people around him, [Yang Meng] immediately changed his tone.
0:56:39|0:56:46|With a bewildered look, [Li Zheng] ignored the expectant gazes of everyone and sighed, raising his hand towards the distance.
0:57:20|0:57:25|[Han Mushan] finished speaking, and the surveillance camera suddenly turned towards him. [Ma Rui] quickly coughed a few times.
0:57:52|0:57:59|The window was suddenly closed, and everyone fell into silence. [Ma Rui] picked up the medicine.
0:58:45|0:58:47|While others were fighting over medication, [Li Zheng] started singing.
0:59:11|0:59:19|He slapped himself after each line he sang, surprising the people around him, who quickly started imitating [Li Zheng] by fiercely slapping their own faces.
0:59:37|0:59:40|Seeing everyone acting crazy, [An Xi] ran over.
0:59:52|1:0:4|[An Xi] screamed and held her head, with the image of her struggling in the water flashing through her mind.
1:0:4|1:0:5|People around saw [An Xi].
1:0:24|1:0:43|Seeing [An Xi] stomping her feet and crying loudly, everyone stood still in shock, looking at her with strange eyes. She trembled, placed her hand on her chest, pointed, then bent down to pick up the medicine next to the pillar. After looking at everyone in front of her, she immediately poured all the medicine into her mouth.
1:0:46|1:0:54|An Xi then threw away the box of pills and started chewing the medication in her mouth, capturing everyone's attention.
1:0:54|1:1:7|At this moment, [An Xi] kept making choking sounds, tears streaking down her face, yet she still struggled to swallow the medicine. The others seemed frozen, silently watching everything [An Xi] was doing, while [Ma Rui] and [Xiao Nai'en] stood by, mouths half open in shock.
1:1:9|1:1:15|The phone on the stairs suddenly rang, breaking the silence, and the scene cut back to the treatment room.
1:1:15|1:1:21|The doctor opened the blinds, and a beam of light instantly shone through the window into the treatment room.
1:1:21|1:1:25|[An Xi], with a pale face, is sitting in a chair with her head down.
1:1:38|1:1:45|My treatment plan. At this moment, the scene returns to the mental hospital, with [An Xi] answering the phone, while the others gather around her.
1:2:13|1:2:24|After the dean hung up the phone, everyone looked at each other in confusion. [An Xi] silently put down the phone in her hand, tears welling up in her eyes once again, and the atmosphere fell into a stalemate.
1:2:24|1:2:29|Soon, everyone gathered together to start discussing. After a round of applause, [Ma Rui] spoke.
1:2:42|1:2:46|[Xiao Nai'en] and [Ma Rui] raised their hands, and [Han Mushan] also raised his hand.
1:3:5|1:3:10|[Lily] lowered her head and fell silent after hearing this, quietly taking a step to the side.
1:3:32|1:3:34|[An Xi] looked up and calmly said to them.
1:4:41|1:4:47|[Li Zheng] suddenly bent over, clutching his stomach and laughing. [Ma Rui] standing on the stairs looked surprised.
1:4:47|1:4:50|Ma Rui's face gradually darkened after being mocked.
1:5:32|1:5:41|After speaking, [Yang Meng] quickly ran a few steps and climbed up the stairs' railing.
1:5:41|1:5:44|In the treatment room, [An Xi] stared at the dean and cried out questioning.
1:5:53|1:5:57|[An Xi] clenched her fists, furrowed her brows, tears streaking down her face.
1:5:57|1:6:7|At this moment, [Ma Rui] and others were so scared that they ran down the stairs in the mental hospital.
1:6:29|1:6:37|[Yang Meng] hadn't finished speaking when [Han Mushan] walked over and slapped him.
1:6:37|1:6:42|On the side, [Xiao Nai'en] raised his arm to strike, but was stopped by [Li Zheng].
1:6:42|1:6:45|Furious, [Yang Meng] lifted his leg and kicked [Han Mushan].
1:6:45|1:6:48|[Ma Rui] rushed up to help, but was pushed away by him.
1:6:48|1:6:53|[Lily] protected [An Xi] behind her, rushed forward, and pulled [Ma Rui], who was about to hit someone, aside.
1:7:5|1:7:8|The dean's words kept echoing in [An Xi]'s mind.
1:7:8|1:7:13|Watching everyone fighting each other, [An Xi] wanted to step in and break it up, but ended up being pushed to the ground from behind.
1:7:25|1:7:31|[An Xi] slowly got up from the ground, looking up at the sky outside the skylight where dark clouds were gathering.
1:7:31|1:7:40|After a flash of lightning and a clap of thunder, torrential rain poured down from the sky, the cold rain hitting his face, mixing with tears.
1:7:40|1:7:49|At this moment, the people nearby were still tangled up, roaring angrily with their faces turning red.
1:8:29|1:8:46|At this moment, a siren blares and the tightly closed inner door finally opens automatically. The dazzling beam of light unexpectedly squeezes into the long-unseen mental hospital, and the struggling group of people finally stops. They look at the open door with a hint of disbelief.
1:8:46|1:8:53|At this moment, [An Xi], kneeling on the ground with a weary face, finally showed a faint smile, while the others stared at the door for a long time before reacting.
1:9:6|1:9:14|Everyone rushed out in a panic, leaving [An Xi] alone kneeling on the ground. At that moment, the figure of the dean appeared at the door.
1:9:25|1:9:30|The wet hair stuck to An Xi's face, and he smiled as if relieved.
1:9:30|1:9:34|At this moment, his body slowly leaned to the right and then fell still to the ground.
1:9:34|1:9:41|After fainting, [An Xi] seemed to have his whole body falling into the deep sea, but he didn't struggle, instead sinking slowly with gravity.
1:9:42|1:9:59|A beam of strong light pierced through the deep sea, casting a paler shadow on [An Xi]. Suddenly, the dim sea surface gradually became clear, and the figure of a man in a suit jacket appeared on the water. At this moment, [An Xi] took a deep breath and woke up, his eyes filled with fear and tears streaming down his cheeks.
1:10:0|1:10:5|He stared at the fan spinning on the wall, then turned his head to look around. 
1:10:5|1:10:10|[An Xi] lay on the ground for a while, when suddenly, footsteps could be heard approaching from outside the prison.
1:10:10|1:10:15|He struggled to get up from the ground, only to see [Han Mushan] in a white coat walking in.
1:10:15|1:10:19|He took a few steps back in fear, only to bump into [Ma Rui] crouching in the corner.
1:10:24|1:10:29|[An Xi] tried to stifle her sobs, stood up, and grabbed [Ma Rui]'s hand to comfort him.
1:10:35|1:10:39|But the other person shook off [An Xi]'s hand and pointed at him.
1:10:39|1:10:46|[An Xi] cried and tried to explain, when suddenly a pair of glasses flew out from the kitchen, and [Yang Meng] kicked [Xiao Nai'en] to the ground.
1:11:1|1:11:7|[An Xi] quickly ran over and pulled [Yang Meng], who was about to hit someone, apart from the middle.
1:11:7|1:11:11|At this moment, the unfamiliar [Ma Rui] and [Han Mushan] also ran out.
1:11:23|1:11:26|[An Xi] stepped forward again to stop him, but was pushed away by [Yang Meng].
1:11:59|1:12:6|Everyone turned around to look.
1:12:6|1:12:9|The dean stood on the second floor watching them.
1:12:27|1:12:37|After [Li Zheng], An Xi tried to bend her injured leg, Ma Rui raised his hand to grab the neck collar, Lily took out the medicine for asthma relief to check, and Han Mushan also took off the gauze on his head with a puzzled look.
1:12:58|1:13:2|Han Mushan stood still for a long time after hearing this, while the others looked at him one after another.
1:13:16|1:13:20|[Xiao Nai'en]'s memory of the classroom has now turned into an unfinished building.
1:13:42|1:13:49|[Ma Rui] recalled the scene in the courtroom but couldn't see the face of the person involved no matter how hard he tried. He attempted to attract the other party by shouting, but the person gradually disappeared, which greatly shocked [Ma Rui].
1:14:36|1:14:43|You always complain about the congested road, [Yang Meng] closes his eyes and tries hard to recall, but the pain in his head makes him unable to help but squat on the ground.
1:15:51|1:15:59|In the scene, [An Xi] is looking in the mirror, but her clothes keep changing constantly, from a leather jacket to a suit, and then from a bathrobe to a white coat.
1:16:15|1:16:29|After listening to these words, [An Xi] sitting in the therapy room lowered his head in pain. Suddenly, he picked up the steaming cup of water in his hand and placed it in the middle of the table. He then pointed his index finger straight at the director sitting across from him, slowly raised his head and said.
1:16:41|1:16:47|At this moment, [An Xi] had half of his face covered by his hair, with his hands crossed over his chest as he pondered.
1:17:5|1:17:9|[An Xi] frantically tried to explain, but suddenly couldn't catch her breath.
1:17:9|1:17:14|An Xi opened her mouth wide, breathing heavily, her eyes becoming fierce.
1:17:14|1:17:17|She stared at the dean with wide eyes.
1:17:28|1:17:34|After speaking, he turned his head and looked at the dean sitting opposite with a resentful look in his eyes.
1:17:34|1:17:42|He frowned at the dean, but soon nodded secretly and then pointed at him.
1:17:42|1:17:52|At this moment, [An Xi] had a look of anger on his face, tightly pursing his lips and raising his chin defiantly as he stared at the dean. But soon, his expression gradually turned despondent.
1:19:37|1:19:43|[An Xi] raised her hand and slammed it heavily on the table, lifting her head to look at the dean. She sniffed, then turned to the other side.
1:20:44|1:20:44|Now.
1:21:20|1:21:24|After speaking, [An Xi] in the treatment room grabbed her own neck and fell to the ground.
1:21:24|1:21:28|Following that, [An Xi] in the bathtub submerged her entire body in the water.
1:21:28|1:21:32|Suddenly, [Ma Rui] and the others all looked at the scars on their wrists.
1:21:45|1:21:52|An Xi, who finds it hard to accept reality, hurriedly flees. But as she runs towards the corridor near the prison, suddenly a sound of something falling is heard.
1:21:52|1:22:1|She turned around with tears in her eyes, only to see the buildings behind her collapsing one by one, with the walls around her gradually peeling off and floating in the air.
1:22:1|1:22:5|[An Xi] looked fearfully at everything in front of her, but could only watch them disappear helplessly.
1:22:8|1:22:26|At this moment, the ground near him also began to crack and split apart. [An Xi] hesitated and took a few steps back. Soon, the ground turned into pieces and started floating into the air. The surrounding walls also began to explode more violently. [An Xi] slowly walked along the edge of the wall, reaching out to touch it.
1:22:26|1:22:42|The wall cracked open as he touched it and walked forward. The surrounding wall fragments increased. He couldn't help but look back at the path he had walked. At this moment, the walls on both sides burst instantly, and large and small fragments gathered in the air.
1:22:42|1:22:52|At this moment, [An Xi] also felt a sharp pain in his head, he opened his mouth wide and raised one hand to hold his head, while the walls around him occasionally made exploding sounds.
1:22:52|1:22:58|At this moment, [An Xi] is holding her head in pain, her body unable to stop the constant throbbing.
1:22:58|1:23:3|As the pain intensified, [An Xi] couldn't help but start wailing uncontrollably.
1:23:3|1:23:7|She slowly leaned back, holding her head, and sat on a hospital bed.
1:23:7|1:23:12|An Xi, feeling helpless, curled up her whole body and let out a painful scream.
1:23:12|1:23:18|The surrounding wall fragments gradually disappeared, and [An Xi], nestled in the arms, finally dared to slowly raise her head to observe carefully.
1:23:19|1:23:26|At this moment, he was in a tidy ward, with a dim light casting a faint glow in front of the hospital bed.
1:23:26|1:23:33|[An Xi] sat on the hospital bed, hugging her legs, her body trembling uncontrollably, even her breathing becoming rapid.
1:23:33|1:23:50|He looked around and saw various pieces of furniture in the spacious ward. After a while, his emotions gradually calmed down, and he opened his eyes to take in everything around him. There were two cabinets at the head and foot of the bed, each with a kettle on top, and a painting standing on the table.
1:23:50|1:23:52|Different colored dyes are also placed next to it.
1:23:53|1:24:10|There are other paintings of various styles, placed haphazardly in the corner, and these paintings are exactly the same as those seen in the mental hospital at that time. The blackboard-style walls are filled with regular characters, just like the marks made by [Xiao Nai'en] on the wall every day, and on the sofa opposite sits a cute teddy bear.
1:24:11|1:24:19|Soon, [An Xi] noticed the camera installed in the corner of the wall. He covered it with his hand, quietly observed for a while, and then slowly lowered his head.
1:24:19|1:24:25|He then turned to look at the top of the bed, only to see the words "Only Me" written all over the wall.
1:24:28|1:24:39|[An Xi] was startled by the sudden ringing of the phone, before he could react, the urgent ringing sounded again. He slowly approached the phone, preparing to answer.
1:24:39|1:24:50|The scene shifts, showing the back of the dean in the frame. He opens the blinds and looks back at [An Xi], then takes out a handgun and places it on the table. He then turns the gun handle towards [An Xi] and pushes it towards her.
1:24:50|1:24:59|After the conversation, [An Xi] went to the bathroom, where he was seen leaning over the sink, continuously splashing water on his face. He then covered his face and started to sob.
1:24:59|1:25:3|After a while, he reached out and tightened the faucet, trying to calm himself down.
1:25:3|1:25:10|He slowly lifted his head and stared at his disheveled self in the mirror.
1:25:22|1:25:29|[An Xi] recalled the words of the dean in his mind, looking at himself in the mirror with a hint of unfamiliar feeling.
1:25:29|1:25:33|He slowly stood up, his eyes becoming determined.
1:25:43|1:25:45|The words of the dean are vividly remembered.
1:25:45|1:25:50|An Xi hesitated for a moment, then lowered her head and picked up the handgun placed above the sink.
1:25:50|1:25:53|He held it in his hand and looked at it for a long time, unable to help but start crying again.
1:25:54|1:26:0|The existence of multiple personalities makes [An Xi] suffer greatly, but he has long regarded them as family.
1:26:0|1:26:7|The courage to pick up this gun now is powerless to dilute the pain and entanglement in [An Xi]'s heart.
1:26:7|1:26:18|He had no choice but to bear the endless pressure, holding the gun in his hand as he walked out of the bathroom. Each step he took at this moment felt as heavy and sluggish as if he had a thousand pounds on his feet.
1:26:18|1:26:21|He slowly walked out of the bathroom into the corridor with a gun in his hand.
1:26:22|1:26:31|At this moment, [An Xi] had water droplets on her face, tears shimmering in her eyes. However, her gaze gradually became resolute, and her pace towards the ward quickened.
1:26:31|1:26:38|When she was about to reach the ward, she suddenly stopped at the door, a fierce determination in her eyes.
1:26:38|1:26:42|[An Xi] pushed the door open forcefully and walked in, her eyes wandering around.
1:26:42|1:26:45|At this moment, [Yang Meng] and others surrounded from behind.
1:27:31|1:27:36|[An Xi] picked up the gun, turned around and pointed it at them, the crowd gathered around instantly dispersed.
1:27:36|1:27:40|After spraying around, he pointed the gun at [Han Mushan] standing on the left.
1:27:40|1:27:44|The other person was at a loss and waved his hands in a panic, but [An Xi] still pointed at him.
1:28:10|1:28:14|Han Mushan frowned and lowered his head after hearing, unsure of what to say.
1:28:14|1:28:18|With tears in her eyes, [An Xi] moved the gun towards [Xiao Nai'en] standing on the side.
1:28:49|1:28:55|[Xiao Nai'en] suddenly remembered the painting he had seen before, with the figures in the painting being him and [An Xi].
1:29:24|1:29:29|[Ma Rui] felt extremely uncomfortable after hearing it, turned his head away, unwilling to look at [An Xi].
1:30:19|1:30:22|[Li Zheng] frowned, not daring to meet [An Xi]'s eyes.
1:30:22|1:30:29|In the memory, [An Xi] was posing with her hand on the bookshelf, while [Li Zheng] was taking pictures of her with a camera, both of them having a great time.
1:30:32|1:30:36|[An Xi] finished speaking, [Li Zheng] turned his head and looked at him with heartache.
1:30:36|1:30:41|At this moment, [An Xi] was already in tears, leaning on [Li Zheng]'s shoulder with a face full of grievances.
1:30:41|1:30:46|[Li Zheng] moved his mouth, but couldn't say anything, so he sadly closed his eyes.
1:30:46|1:30:53|An Xi then let go of Li Zheng and walked towards Yang Meng, who had turned his back. He wiped away his tears and then pulled him over with one hand.
1:32:21|1:32:25|Lily, on the side, lowered her head, trying hard to control her emotions.
1:32:25|1:32:29|[Li Zheng] looked up and closed his eyes, while [Xiao Nai'en] tightly pursed his lips.
1:32:40|1:32:56|The crowd was completely moved by the words of [An Xi], and [Ma Rui] couldn't help but cry along with him. But at this moment, a piercing sound rang in [An Xi]'s head, causing him to grimace in pain, clutching his head tightly. The pain intensified, and [An Xi] couldn't help but bend over to ease it, but at that moment,
1:32:56|1:32:59|A hand suddenly picked up the gun in [An Xi]'s hand.
1:33:6|1:33:11|The dean tightly held [An Xi]'s hand holding the gun, looking at the people standing opposite.
1:33:43|1:33:46|[An Xi] put down the gun, reluctant to look back.
1:33:46|1:33:49|[Li Zheng] and [Yang Meng] stood in place, silently watching her.
1:33:49|1:33:54|Afterwards, [An Xi] struggled to hold back her sobs, raised the pistol, and turned her head to stare blankly ahead.
1:34:1|1:34:6|He looked at the dean with tears in his eyes, then raised the gun to his own temple.
1:34:6|1:34:10|As the sound of gunshots rang out, the screen plunged into darkness.
1:34:10|1:34:13|After a while, a shell casing dropped at the feet of [An Xi].
1:34:13|1:34:18|[Lee Zheng] raised [An Xi]'s arm from behind and pointed the gun towards the ceiling.
1:34:19|1:34:29|An Xi slowly opened her eyes as she lowered her head, with Ma Rui slowly releasing his arm. An Xi, who had just realized the situation, looked around and found everyone looking at him with concern.
1:34:29|1:34:33|He then turned around to look at [Li Zheng] standing behind him, revealing a happy smile.
1:34:34|1:34:50|Not long after, he fainted in [Li Zheng]'s arms. At that moment, [An Xi] felt as if she was in the quiet depths of the sea, with the sound of gentle waves in her ears and the continuous melody of the moon's whistle. Upon hearing it, [An Xi] immediately opened her eyes and looked around.
1:34:50|1:35:5|Surrounded by others in the mental hospital, [An Xi] lies on [Lily]'s lap with a peaceful expression, sleeping soundly. [Lily] gently strokes [An Xi]'s hair, while [Yang Meng] squats across, humming a familiar tune. [Han Mushan] smiles as he looks at the sleeping [An Xi].
1:35:32|1:35:41|[Han Mushan] lowered his head silently behind the hall, [Xiao Nai'en] turned around, reluctant to look at the place where everyone had once been together, while [Yang Meng] picked up the handgun on the ground decisively.
1:36:10|1:36:19|Maybe when he gets old, he will have his own house on the beach.
1:36:33|1:36:44|After speaking, [Yang Meng] and [Li Zheng] both squatted beside [Lily], looking reluctantly at the peacefully sleeping [An Xi]. [Ma Rui] couldn't help but let out a sigh, then stubbornly turned his head to the other side.
1:36:44|1:36:48|[Yang Meng] nodded with a smile, and [Lily] instantly understood his meaning, giving him a playful smile.
1:36:48|1:36:56|Later, everyone turned around and smiled at [Ma Rui] standing in the distance, only to see him sniff and turn his head to the other side.
1:36:56|1:36:59|He then pretended to be indifferent and walked in front of [Li Zheng].
1:37:11|1:37:19|[Ma Rui] listened and lowered his head with a silent smile. [Yang Meng] stood up from the ground, gazing at the sleeping [An Xi], reluctant to open his eyes.
1:37:19|1:37:27|Later, he looked at [Xiao Nai'en] standing beside him, who nodded in agreement. Then, everyone surrounded [An Xi] in the middle.
1:37:27|1:37:43|At this moment, [Yang Meng] once again played the familiar melody. [An Xi], lying on [Lily]'s lap, hugged himself with both hands. At this moment, he no longer frowned, but fell asleep with a faint smile. Accompanied by a loud gunshot, the melody on his lips also stopped.
1:37:43|1:37:50|At this moment, [An Xi] in the deep sea of consciousness was awakened by the consecutive gunshots. She struggled incessantly but couldn't open her eyes.
1:37:50|1:38:2|Just as the final gunshot rang out, [An Xi] suddenly opened her eyes, then she raised her hand to slowly push aside the hair on her face, looking around cautiously. At this moment, she was already lying on a hospital bed.
1:38:3|1:38:9|Looking at the familiar surroundings, [An Xi] slowly sat up in bed, the surroundings were eerily quiet.
1:38:9|1:38:19|She slowly turned around and looked behind her. At that moment, the sunlight from outside the window illuminated the entire ward. [An Xi], who was unaware of what was happening, felt a bit at a loss.
1:38:19|1:38:26|She blinked and turned her head, showing no emotion on her face. At that moment, [An Xi] was captivated by a painting across from her.
1:38:27|1:38:33|The seven people in the conversation had joyful expressions on their faces as they sat on the bus, chatting and laughing.
1:38:33|1:38:37|Sitting on the hospital bed, [An Xi] looked at the painting, tears welling up in her eyes instantly.
1:38:37|1:38:40|Later, she packed up her luggage and stood in front of the gate of the mental hospital.
1:38:44|1:39:1|The sturdy iron gate opened for [An Xi] at this moment. He had changed into clean clothes and walked out of the gate. The sky was filled with snowflakes floating freely like goose feathers. He stood alone in the snow, looking particularly small. The mental hospital behind him had also been renovated, giving it a touch of coldness.
1:39:1|1:39:8|Soon, the doors of the mental hospital slowly closed, and [An Xi] with a scarf around her neck looked up at the snowflakes dancing in the air.
1:39:8|1:39:18|She tried to tilt her face up, feeling the cold snowflakes gently melting on her cheeks, and carefully experiencing the coldness of the strands of cold wind penetrating her body through the gaps in her clothes.
1:39:18|1:39:23|At this moment, [An Xi]'s face showed no joy, but instead turned sorrowful.
1:39:23|1:39:27|Not long after, she walked alone by the road, dragging her suitcase.
1:39:27|1:39:33|At this moment, the accumulated snow on the road has long melted away, while the small trees beside it are still covered in white snow.
1:39:33|1:39:38|[An Xi] approached closer, her eyes shining as bright as snow.
1:39:38|1:39:44|Suddenly, a bus appeared behind her. She stopped and turned around to see [Lily] waving at her.
1:40:49|1:40:53|The film ends here, thank you for listening.
1:40:53|1:40:55|At the end of the film, a post-credits scene will be shown.
1:42:37|1:42:38|Now let's talk about the post-credits scene.
1:42:41|1:42:49|The sudden voice in her mind made the smile on [An Xi]'s face disappear instantly, but at this moment, [An Xi] seemed to have fallen into a deep sea once again.
1:42:49|1:42:57|But she refused to sink into despair, instead following the shining sunlight, swimming upstream towards the dazzling light that seemed within reach.
1:42:57|1:43:7|[An Xi] struggled to kick her legs, trying to reach the bright side quickly. But just as she was about to emerge from the water, everything around her was enveloped in a beam of light.
1:43:7|1:43:24|We see [An Xi] lying in the bathtub, slowly opening her eyes. In a daze, she sees a reflection of a man in a suit near the bathtub. Startled, [An Xi] sits up in the bathtub. The man in the suit, with his hands in his pockets, takes a glance at her struggling to breathe at the moment, then slowly sits down beside the bathtub.
1:43:24|1:43:33|[An Xi] with wet hair, looked up at him, her eyes filled with fear and helplessness.
1:45:0|1:45:7|In the turbulent world, disappeared without a trace, and moved into the darkness.
